WEBVTT

00:00.701 --> 00:02.173
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.173 --> 00:04.705
MY NAME IS BREE,
AND I AM AN ALCOHOLIC.

00:04.705 --> 00:07.338
BREE PUT HER PROBLEM
BEHIND HER.
 (camera shutter clicks)

00:07.338 --> 00:10.010
THERE'S AT LEAST ONE EMPLOYER
WHO'D LOVE TO HIRE ME.
 WHO?

00:10.010 --> 00:12.443
ORSON ASKED FOR A JOB.
 YOU.

00:12.443 --> 00:15.386
DAVE LOST HIS TEMPER...
 DAMN IT, EDIE! I SAID NO!

00:15.386 --> 00:18.219
AND AROUSED THE SUSPICION...
 THIS GUY
IS UP TO SOMETHING.

00:18.219 --> 00:22.453
OF HIS NEIGHBOR.
 IT WAS
ALL KAREN McCLUSKEY'S FAULT.

00:22.453 --> 00:25.656
SHE KEPT ASKING ME ALL THIS
STUFF ABOUT YOUR BACKGROUND.

00:25.656 --> 00:28.028
SHE REMINDS ME OF MY GRANDMOTHER
WHEN WE FIRST STARTED TO NOTICE.

00:28.028 --> 00:30.461
THE DEMENTIA, THAT IS.
 YOU THINK
KAREN'S GOING SENILE?

00:35.636 --> 00:38.739
(Mary Alice) IT COULD HAVE BEEN
SUCH A LOVELY EVENING.

00:38.739 --> 00:44.515
YOU SEE, THE IDEA WAS TO HAVE
A SURPRISE BIRTHDAY PARTY.

00:44.515 --> 00:46.517
PEOPLE WOULD BRING
FOOD AND GIFTS

00:46.517 --> 00:47.818
AND WAIT IN THE DARK

00:47.818 --> 00:51.682
FOR THE GUEST OF HONOR
TO ARRIVE.

00:51.682 --> 00:54.685
BUT IT TURNED OUT TO BE
A NIGHT FULL OF SURPRISES--

00:54.685 --> 00:57.788
THE KIND
MOST PEOPLE DON'T CARE FOR.

00:57.788 --> 01:00.791
DAMN IT, LYNETTE. WHY DO YOU
HAVE TO BE SUCH A BUZZ KILL?

01:00.791 --> 01:03.734
WHY CAN'T YOU, JUST ONCE,
GIVE ME A LITTLE SUPPORT?

01:03.734 --> 01:06.297
FINE. (scoffs)
I'LL GET YOU A TOWEL.

01:06.297 --> 01:07.738
FOR WHAT?

01:10.171 --> 01:13.404
IF I WAS WITH ANOTHER WOMAN,
THAT WOULDN'T BOTHER YOU?

01:13.404 --> 01:14.845
NO, IT WOULDN'T.

01:18.309 --> 01:19.550
MM.

01:21.812 --> 01:24.855
I'M SORRY THAT I LIED,
AND FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,

01:24.855 --> 01:26.857
THE GUILT HAS BEEN
TEARING ME APART.

01:26.857 --> 01:30.391
GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME,
YOU SELFISH SON OF A BITCH!
 (thud)

01:30.391 --> 01:32.863
ORSON, PLEASE. YOU'RE PUTTING ME
IN AN IMPOSSIBLE POSITION.

01:32.863 --> 01:35.596
THEN LET ME
MAKE IT SIMPLER FOR YOU.

01:35.596 --> 01:38.469
I WANT A DIVORCE.

01:38.469 --> 01:43.234
OH, YES, IT COULD HAVE BEEN
SUCH A LOVELY EVENING,

01:43.234 --> 01:46.277
BUT THIS WAS ONE PARTY
THAT WAS OVER...

01:46.277 --> 01:48.639
BEFORE IT EVEN BEGAN.

01:48.639 --> 01:51.742
(all) SURPRISE!

01:51.742 --> 01:54.245
YOU THINK
YOU CAN SCREW WITH ME?

01:54.245 --> 01:55.816
(all scream)

01:55.816 --> 02:07.458
UHH!

02:07.458 --> 02:10.130
MOMENTS BEFORE SHE WAS TO LEAVE
FOR THE PARTY,

02:10.130 --> 02:12.163
GABRIELLE SOLIS WAS
AT HER MIRROR,

02:12.163 --> 02:16.867
HALFHEARTEDLY PUTTING
THE FINAL TOUCHES ON HER LIPS.

02:16.867 --> 02:20.641
YOU SEE, A PROBLEM
HAD COME TO HER ATTENTION...

02:20.641 --> 02:21.672
(whispers) DAMN.

02:21.672 --> 02:24.845
ONE SHE COULDN'T GLOSS OVER.

02:24.845 --> 02:27.718
MOMMY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

02:27.718 --> 02:30.721
UH, WELL, MOMMY HAS A FRIEND
WHO VISITS HER EVERY MONTH,

02:30.721 --> 02:33.684
AND SHE'S LATE,
AND THAT'S BAD.

02:33.684 --> 02:36.687
WHY?
 BECAUSE SHE'S
THE ONE WHO ASSURES ME

02:36.687 --> 02:40.231
THAT YOU WON'T GET
A BABY BROTHER OR SISTER.
 BUT I WANT A LITTLE BROTHER.

02:40.231 --> 02:42.693
I DON'T CARE.

02:42.693 --> 02:44.565
(sighs) OH, SORRY.

02:44.565 --> 02:47.638
IT'S JUST...
MOMMY REALLY MISSES HER FRIEND,

02:47.638 --> 02:49.740
AND MOMMY'S
GONNA BE REALLY SAD

02:49.740 --> 02:51.742
IF HER FRIEND
DOESN'T SHOW UP SOON.

02:51.742 --> 02:55.546
NOW GO DOWNSTAIRS AND PLAY.
MOMMY HAS SOME PRAYING TO DO.

02:58.779 --> 03:00.551
(sighs)

03:03.284 --> 03:04.815
(spritzing)

03:04.815 --> 03:07.888
WELL,
I HAVE YOUR TEST RESULTS.

03:07.888 --> 03:11.392
CONGRATULATIONS.
YOU'RE PREGNANT.

03:11.392 --> 03:12.893
AAH!

03:12.893 --> 03:14.295
MRS. SOLIS.

03:14.295 --> 03:17.468
I DON'T CARE. YOU TOLD ME
THIS COULDN'T HAPPEN.

03:17.468 --> 03:21.732
YOU SAID IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE!
 THE HUMAN REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM
IS COMPLICATED

03:21.732 --> 03:23.234
AND OFTEN UNPREDICTABLE.

03:23.234 --> 03:25.276
SOMETIMES MIRACLES HAPPEN.

03:25.276 --> 03:27.638
THIS ISN'T A MIRACLE.
THIS IS A DISASTER.

03:27.638 --> 03:30.911
MY HUSBAND'S BLIND.
NEITHER ONE OF US HAVE JOBS.

03:30.911 --> 03:32.813
MY HUSBAND'S BLIND.

03:32.813 --> 03:35.346
TRUST ME.
CHILDREN ARE A BLESSING.

03:35.346 --> 03:37.448
YOU'LL SEE.
IT'LL ALL WORK OUT.

03:37.448 --> 03:39.590
WELL, I HOPE TO GOD
YOU'RE RIGHT.

03:39.590 --> 03:41.752
AND WHAT DOES
THIS NUMBER MEAN ANYWAY?

03:41.752 --> 03:43.254
THAT'S YOUR BETA NUMBER,

03:43.254 --> 03:46.957
AND IT'S HIGH, WHICH INDICATES
THE POSSIBILITY OF TWINS.

03:46.957 --> 03:48.699
OW!

03:50.331 --> 03:53.334
GABY, RELAX. THIS BABY IS
GONNA BE THE BEST THING

03:53.334 --> 03:57.708
THAT EVER HAPPENED TO US.
 I AM SO SICK OF EVERYBODY
LOOKING AT THE GLASS HALF-FULL.

03:57.708 --> 04:00.641
THE GLASS IS EMPTY, PEOPLE,
AND SO IS OUR BANK ACCOUNT.

04:00.641 --> 04:02.613
IS THAT WHAT
YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT--MONEY?

04:02.613 --> 04:04.515
LOOK, I'LL GET A JOB.

04:04.515 --> 04:06.517
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO,

04:06.517 --> 04:09.380
TAKE UP PIANO AND GET A CONTRACT
WITH MOTOWN?

04:09.380 --> 04:11.382
ACTUALLY, I WAS THINKING
ABOUT BECOMING A MASSEUR.

04:11.382 --> 04:14.024
YOU DON'T NEED YOUR EYES FOR
THAT. IT'S ALL ABOUT THE TOUCH.

04:14.024 --> 04:18.689
WELL, I GUESS THAT'S NOT
THE WORST IDEA YOU'VE EVER HAD.

04:18.689 --> 04:20.690
BUT IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT
THE MONEY, CARLOS.

04:20.690 --> 04:22.963
IT'S... (sighs)

04:22.963 --> 04:26.837
OH, AFTER MY MISCARRIAGE,
I GAVE UP ON THIS DREAM.

04:26.837 --> 04:28.839
I JUST FIGURED GOD DECIDED

04:28.839 --> 04:30.841
I COULDN'T POSSIBLY
BE A GOOD MOM,

04:30.841 --> 04:32.903
SO HE DIDN'T MAKE IT HAPPEN.

04:32.903 --> 04:34.905
WELL, HE OBVIOUSLY
CHANGED HIS MIND.

04:34.905 --> 04:36.977
WELL, I WISH
HE'D STOP DOING THAT.

04:36.977 --> 04:40.280
NOBODY LIKES A FICKLE GOD.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.912
BABE, BELIEVE ME.

04:41.912 --> 04:44.915
YOU GETTING PREGNANT IS--IS--
IS A ONE-IN-A-MILLION SHOT.

04:44.915 --> 04:46.617
IT'S A MIRACLE.

04:46.617 --> 04:49.990
NOW LET'S EMBRACE IT
AND CELEBRATE.

04:56.827 --> 04:58.729
HELLO, MRS. SOLIS.

04:58.729 --> 05:00.901
I HAVE YOUR TEST RESULTS.

05:00.901 --> 05:02.933
GREAT. SO DO I HAVE ANEMIA?

05:02.933 --> 05:04.935
IS THAT WHY
I'VE BEEN SO TIRED?

05:04.935 --> 05:08.779
NO. NOT EXACTLY.

05:08.779 --> 05:11.582
AND PLEASE DON'T SLAP ME.

05:13.414 --> 05:14.815
(door slams)

05:14.815 --> 05:18.318
I'M PREGNANT!
 OH, MY GOD.
IT'S ANOTHER MIRACLE.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.320
YEAH,
WE'RE UP TO TWO MIRACLES,

05:20.320 --> 05:23.654
AND IF YOU COME BACK
FROM THE DEAD AFTER I KILL YOU,

05:23.654 --> 05:26.557
IT'LL BE THREE.
 (laughs)
W-WHY YOU MAD AT ME?

05:26.557 --> 05:28.559
"OH, GABY, WHY DO I NEED
TO WEAR A CONDOM?

05:28.559 --> 05:31.101
THERE'S NO WAY LIGHTNING'S
GONNA STRIKE TWICE."

05:31.101 --> 05:33.103
WELL,
I DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD.

05:33.103 --> 05:35.766
PUT THE BABY DOWN, CARLOS.

05:35.766 --> 05:37.638
I DON'T WANT TO.

05:37.638 --> 05:40.471
DO IT. I NEED TO HIT SOMETHING,
AND IT NEEDS TO BE YOU.

05:40.471 --> 05:42.473
YOU ARE LOOKING AT THIS
ALL WRONG.

05:42.473 --> 05:43.974
THIS IS ONE-IN-A-MILLION.

05:43.974 --> 05:46.076
WE SHOULD--WE SHOULD
CELEBRATE AND EMBRACE--

05:46.076 --> 05:48.348
OH, CRAM IT,
YOU FERTILE FREAK.

05:48.348 --> 05:49.950
YOU'RE GETTING A VASECTOMY.

05:49.950 --> 05:51.652
I CAN'T DO THAT.

05:51.652 --> 05:53.984
WE'RE CATHOLIC.
IT'S AGAINST OUR RELIGION.

05:53.984 --> 05:56.657
I GOT NEWS FOR YOU.
WE JUST CONVERTED TO JUDAISM.

05:56.657 --> 05:58.989
PROBLEM SOLVED. MAZEL TOV!

05:58.989 --> 06:01.932
GABY, IT'S NOT JUST THAT.
THERE ARE OTHER REASONS--

06:01.932 --> 06:04.565
I AM DONE FIGHTING OFF
YOUR BIONIC SPERM.

06:04.565 --> 06:07.067
YOU'RE GETTING SNIPPED,
AND THAT'S FINAL.

06:10.901 --> 06:13.704
(dog barking in distance)

06:13.704 --> 06:16.006
YOU'RE AWFULLY QUIET
TONIGHT.

06:16.006 --> 06:18.378
GOT A LOT ON MY MIND.

06:18.378 --> 06:19.950
I THINK I'M PREGNANT.

06:19.950 --> 06:21.652
WHAT?

06:21.652 --> 06:24.915
I KNOW. IT'S CRAZY. YOU HAD
A VASECTOMY. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

06:24.915 --> 06:27.958
YEAH. SO WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
YOU'RE PREGNANT?

06:27.958 --> 06:30.461
MY PERIOD'S LATE,
AND THAT NEVER HAPPENS TO ME.

06:30.461 --> 06:34.164
I'M LIKE A SWISS CLOCK.
 OH, COME ON. THERE COULD BE
A LOT OF REASONS FOR THAT.

06:34.164 --> 06:36.867
SO LET'S NOT WORRY ABOUT IT
RIGHT NOW.

06:36.867 --> 06:39.169
WE'RE GOING TO A PARTY.
YOU GOTTA LIGHTEN UP.

06:39.169 --> 06:42.533
OKAY.
BUT I'M GONNA TALK TO BOB.
 BOB? WHY?

06:42.533 --> 06:45.035
BECAUSE HE AND LEE ARE HERE.
BOB'S AN ATTORNEY.

06:45.035 --> 06:47.037
I'M GONNA GET HIM
TO SUE THE QUACK

06:47.037 --> 06:49.039
WHO OBVIOUSLY BOTCHED
YOUR VASECTOMY.

06:49.039 --> 06:52.042
OH, GABY, LET'S NOT GO THERE.
HIRING AN ATTORNEY'S EXPENSIVE,

06:52.042 --> 06:54.545
AND I DON'T KNOW
THAT WE CAN PROVE ANYTHING.

06:54.545 --> 06:56.547
WELL, I'M GONNA FIND OUT.

06:56.547 --> 06:59.119
FINE. BUT...

06:59.119 --> 07:00.951
LET'S NOT TALK TO BOB.

07:00.951 --> 07:03.954
I DON'T WANT OUR NEIGHBORS
INVOLVED IN OUR BUSINESS.
 (rings doorbell)

07:03.954 --> 07:05.956
OH, DON'T WORRY.
HE'S A PROFESSIONAL.

07:05.956 --> 07:07.658
HE'LL KEEP IT CONFIDENTIAL.

07:07.658 --> 07:09.660
GABY, NO.
YOU CAN'T TALK TO HIM.

07:09.660 --> 07:12.833
WHY THE HELL NOT?
 I NEVER GOT A VASECTOMY.

07:12.833 --> 07:15.005
HI, GUYS.
WELCOME TO THE PARTY.

07:24.515 --> 07:26.016
EARLIER THAT EVENING,

07:26.016 --> 07:28.519
AS SHE WAITED
FOR HER GUESTS TO ARRIVE,

07:28.519 --> 07:32.022
SUSAN MAYER TOOK A MOMENT
TO DO HER EYEBROWS.

07:32.022 --> 07:34.084
OF COURSE,
SHE HAD NO WAY OF KNOWING

07:34.084 --> 07:36.527
JUST HOW HIGH THOSE EYEBROWS...

07:36.527 --> 07:38.959
SORRY I'M LATE.
 WOULD SOON BE RAISED.

07:38.959 --> 07:41.962
WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG? PEOPLE
ARE GONNA BE HERE ANY MINUTE.

07:41.962 --> 07:43.994
I NEED YOU TO POUR
THE CHEAP VODKA

07:43.994 --> 07:46.497
INTO THE EXPENSIVE BOTTLES.
 I COULDN'T FIND MY PANTS.

07:46.497 --> 07:49.500
I'M HERE SO MUCH THAT
WHEN I GO BACK TO MY PLACE,

07:49.500 --> 07:52.943
I CAN'T REMEMBER
WHERE ANYTHING IS.
 WELL, JUST PLEASE CHANGE
YOUR SHIRT.

07:52.943 --> 07:55.075
YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN THINKING

07:55.075 --> 07:59.149
THAT I SPEND SO MUCH TIME
WITH YOU NOW ANYWAY THAT--
 FINE. YOU CAN HAVE
A LITTLE SPACE IN THE CLOSET.

07:59.149 --> 08:01.211
I THINK I'VE GOT
SOME CLOTHES FROM THE '80s

08:01.211 --> 08:04.114
I'M READY TO PART WITH.
 ACTUALLY, I'M TALKING
ABOUT MOVING IN.

08:04.114 --> 08:06.817
MOVING IN? HERE?

08:06.817 --> 08:08.589
YEAH.
THAT'S WHERE WE'RE HEADED.

08:08.589 --> 08:10.861
WE SHOULD TAKE THE PLUNGE.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

08:18.669 --> 08:21.171
SO OBVIOUSLY,
THIS IS THE BEDROOM.

08:21.171 --> 08:24.174
RIGHT. SO DO YOU WANT
TO STICK WITH THIS COLOR

08:24.174 --> 08:26.176
OR SWITCH IT UP OR WHAT?

08:26.176 --> 08:27.808
I DON'T KNOW. UM...

08:27.808 --> 08:29.810
I'M SORT OF GOING THROUGH

08:29.810 --> 08:33.884
A DIFFICULT TRANSITION
IN MY LIFE RIGHT NOW.

08:33.884 --> 08:35.986
I NEED A CHANGE.

08:35.986 --> 08:38.589
UH, I WAS THINKING....

08:38.589 --> 08:40.049
TAUPE.

08:40.049 --> 08:42.852
SOUNDS GOOD.

08:42.852 --> 08:45.155
YOU KNOW,
I LIKE THIS PLACE.

08:45.155 --> 08:47.157
IT'S GOT A GOOD VIBE.

08:47.157 --> 08:49.129
UH, THANKS.

08:49.129 --> 08:51.932
AND A NICE SCENT.
WHAT IS THAT, YOUR PERFUME?

08:51.932 --> 08:55.005
GET OUT. (sighs)

08:55.005 --> 08:56.607
EXCUSE ME?

08:56.607 --> 09:00.170
I WAS NOT BORN YESTERDAY, PAL.
YOU'RE COMING ON TO ME.

09:00.170 --> 09:01.742
NO, I'M NOT.

09:01.742 --> 09:03.744
OH, PLEASE.
TELLING ME I SMELL GOOD?

09:03.744 --> 09:06.917
(sniffs) I'M NOT
EVEN WEARING DEODORANT.
 I SAID THE HOUSE SMELLS GOOD.

09:06.917 --> 09:08.148
SEMANTICS.

09:08.148 --> 09:10.821
AND THEN THE NOT SO SUBTLE
SIT-ON-THE-BED MANEUVER?

09:10.821 --> 09:13.123
YOU KNOW, WHY NOT
JUST ASK FOR A MASSAGE?

09:13.123 --> 09:16.126
I SAT BECAUSE MY FEET HURT
FROM YOU DRAGGING ME AROUND

09:16.126 --> 09:19.990
FOR AN HOUR, TELLING ME YOU WANT
TO PAINT EVERY ROOM TAUPE.
 YOU SAID YOU LIKED IT.

09:19.990 --> 09:21.992
LOOK, YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY
GOING THROUGH A ROUGH PATCH.

09:21.992 --> 09:23.293
I WAS AFRAID

09:23.293 --> 09:25.996
IF I SUGGESTED ANYTHING
OUTSIDE THE BEIGE FAMILY,

09:25.996 --> 09:29.569
I MIGHT SEND YOU
OVER THE EDGE.

09:29.569 --> 09:31.341
I'LL LET MYSELF OUT.

09:34.675 --> 09:37.307
NO. NO, DON'T GO.

09:37.307 --> 09:40.150
THAT WAS VERY SWEET OF YOU
TO CONSIDER MY FEELINGS.

09:40.150 --> 09:42.082
YOU KNOW WHAT?

09:42.082 --> 09:44.114
YOU'RE HIRED.

09:44.114 --> 09:46.156
UH, THANKS...

09:46.156 --> 09:48.719
I THINK.

09:51.061 --> 09:57.097
SO DO YOU NEED TO LOOK
THESE OVER ONE MORE TIME?

10:00.070 --> 10:02.002
OKAY, THEN JUST SIGN THEM,

10:02.002 --> 10:03.904
AND YOU'LL
BE OFFICIALLY DIVORCED.

10:05.636 --> 10:09.609
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE NEED A MINUTE.

10:11.742 --> 10:13.113
TAKE YOUR TIME.

10:15.185 --> 10:18.849
(door opens)
 ARE WE DOING
THE RIGHT THING HERE?

10:18.849 --> 10:21.151
(door closes)

10:21.151 --> 10:23.123
YOU'RE KIDDING ME, RIGHT?

10:23.123 --> 10:26.757
ONCE WE SIGN THESE PAPERS,
THERE'S NO GOING BACK.

10:28.859 --> 10:31.802
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

10:31.802 --> 10:34.164
YOU WERE THE ONE
WHO CALLED THE LAWYER.

10:34.164 --> 10:36.006
I KNOW.

10:36.006 --> 10:38.368
I'M THINKING...

10:38.368 --> 10:40.941
THAT MAYBE
THAT WAS A MISTAKE.

10:40.941 --> 10:43.874
WE'VE BEEN SEPARATED
FOR A YEAR.

10:43.874 --> 10:45.846
ALL WE'RE DOING TODAY
IS MAKING IT OFFICIAL.

10:45.846 --> 10:48.849
WE WOULDN'T BE HERE IF IT
WEREN'T FOR THAT ACCIDENT.

10:48.849 --> 10:51.181
YOU KNOW THAT.
BEFORE THAT, WE WERE GOOD.

10:51.181 --> 10:54.224
(sighs)
WE COULD GET BACK THERE.

10:56.887 --> 10:59.059
SUSAN...

10:59.059 --> 11:03.764
IT'S NOBODY'S FAULT,
BUT I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE.

11:03.764 --> 11:06.136
OH, COME ON!

11:06.136 --> 11:08.769
WE WERE MIKE AND SUSAN,
REMEMBER?

11:08.769 --> 11:15.045
YOU ONLY GET ONE OF THOSE
IN A LIFETIME.

11:17.047 --> 11:20.911
WE COULD MAKE THINGS
RIGHT AGAIN.

11:20.911 --> 11:23.453
YEAH.

11:23.453 --> 11:26.116
AND HERE'S HOW.

11:35.065 --> 11:36.366
(door closes)

11:39.229 --> 11:40.901
(sighs)

11:44.875 --> 11:47.337
(door closes)
 HEY. YOU'RE BACK.

11:49.940 --> 11:51.942
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

11:51.942 --> 11:55.245
UH... IT--IT LOOKS GOOD.

11:55.245 --> 11:58.248
YEAH, I-I-I THINK YOU WERE RIGHT
TO STICK WITH THIS COLOR.

11:58.248 --> 11:59.950
IT LOOKS FANTASTIC.

11:59.950 --> 12:01.151
THANKS.

12:05.195 --> 12:07.127
DO YOU LIKE SCOTCH?

12:12.302 --> 12:14.064
OKAY...

12:14.064 --> 12:17.137
I NEED TO BE HONEST
ABOUT SOMETHING.

12:17.137 --> 12:19.910
H-HONEST? OKAY.

12:19.910 --> 12:22.112
I DON'T USUALLY
DO THIS KIND OF THING,

12:22.112 --> 12:24.815
HOOK UP LIKE THIS,
OUT OF THE BLUE.

12:24.815 --> 12:27.918
NOT THAT IT WASN'T GREAT,
'CAUSE IT WAS,

12:27.918 --> 12:31.081
BUT I'M NOT REALLY LOOKING
TO START ANYTHING.

12:31.081 --> 12:33.183
WORK IS CRAZY,

12:33.183 --> 12:36.186
AND I JUST GOT A DOG, AND...

12:36.186 --> 12:38.889
I'M JUST NOT IN THAT PLACE
RIGHT NOW.

12:38.889 --> 12:41.391
SO JUST TO BE CLEAR,

12:41.391 --> 12:45.135
YOU'RE SAYING YOU DON'T WANT
A RELATIONSHIP?

12:45.135 --> 12:48.138
SORRY. I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE
SAID THAT RIGHT UP FRONT.

12:48.138 --> 12:52.042
NO, UH... (scoffs)

12:52.042 --> 12:53.473
IT'S FANTASTIC.

12:53.473 --> 12:55.445
REALLY?

12:55.445 --> 12:59.249
I DON'T WANT
A RELATIONSHIP EITHER.

12:59.249 --> 13:01.852
ALL I WANT FROM YOU IS
EXACTLY WHAT WE JUST DID.

13:01.852 --> 13:05.255
EXCEPT NEXT TIME,
IT'S SUSAN.

13:05.255 --> 13:06.887
YEAH.

13:06.887 --> 13:09.920
"MRS. MAYER" WAS PROBABLY
A LITTLE FORMAL FOR THE MOMENT.

13:09.920 --> 13:12.963
(laughs)
 SO THERE'S GONNA
BE A NEXT TIME?

13:12.963 --> 13:14.794
UNLESS YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED.

13:14.794 --> 13:16.096
ARE YOU KIDDING?

13:16.096 --> 13:19.529
I'M THIS CLOSE TO DOING
A VICTORY LAP AROUND THE BED.

13:19.529 --> 13:21.872
SO YOU'RE REALLY FINE
WITH THIS,

13:21.872 --> 13:23.573
JUST A PURELY PHYSICAL THING?

13:23.573 --> 13:27.577
I GAVE ROMANCE A SHOT AND...

13:27.577 --> 13:30.941
I'M READY FOR SOMETHING
A LITTLE MORE CASUAL.

13:30.941 --> 13:34.114
WOW.

13:34.114 --> 13:37.187
I'VE HEARD OF WOMEN LIKE YOU,
BUT... (laughs)

13:37.187 --> 13:39.389
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
AN URBAN MYTH,

13:39.389 --> 13:42.252
HMM.

13:42.252 --> 13:44.194
(sighs)

13:46.897 --> 13:49.229
DID YOU HEAR WHAT I SAID?

13:50.600 --> 13:54.164
UH, YEAH.

13:54.164 --> 13:56.106
YOU WANT TO MOVE IN.

13:56.106 --> 13:59.239
I-IT'S JUST THAT
WHEN I'M NOT WITH YOU,

13:59.239 --> 14:01.311
I'M WAITING TO BE WITH YOU.

14:01.311 --> 14:03.343
I'VE NEVER FELT
LIKE THIS BEFORE.

14:03.343 --> 14:06.446
SO... WHAT DO YOU THINK?

14:06.446 --> 14:08.879
DO YOU WANT TO
LIVE TOGETHER?

14:08.879 --> 14:11.151
(doorbell rings)

14:11.151 --> 14:13.984
UH...

14:13.984 --> 14:15.255
NO.

14:17.487 --> 14:20.891
SO THAT'S IT? JUST NO?

14:20.891 --> 14:22.893
YOU'RE NOT GONNA GIVE ME
A REASON?

14:22.893 --> 14:24.895
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH THE WAY THINGS ARE?

14:24.895 --> 14:27.237
WHY CHANGE EVERYTHING NOW?

14:27.237 --> 14:28.238
BECAUSE...

14:28.238 --> 14:30.240
I'VE FALLEN IN LOVE
WITH YOU.

14:32.973 --> 14:35.205
HI, GUYS.
WELCOME TO THE PARTY.

14:44.354 --> 14:47.617
THE LAST THING LYNETTE SCAVO
DID BEFORE A PARTY

14:47.617 --> 14:50.260
WAS TO CHECK FOR GRAY HAIRS.

14:50.260 --> 14:51.561
PENNY!

14:51.561 --> 14:53.163
LET'S GO!

14:53.163 --> 14:55.025
TIME FOR BATH!

14:55.025 --> 14:58.028
SHE HAD NO WAY OF KNOWING
BEFORE THIS EVENING WAS OVER,

14:58.028 --> 15:00.030
SHE WOULD HAVE A FEW MORE.

15:00.030 --> 15:01.972
(knocks on window)
 PENNY!

15:05.675 --> 15:09.609
OH. PENNY.

15:09.609 --> 15:12.312
IF YOU'RE THINKING
OF TAKING THAT FOR A SPIN,

15:12.312 --> 15:13.613
I'VE GOT BAD NEWS.

15:13.613 --> 15:15.185
YOU'RE 9.

15:15.185 --> 15:18.548
HEY, WHAT'S THE MATTER,
SWEETIE?

15:18.548 --> 15:21.121
IS DADDY DYING?

15:21.121 --> 15:23.223
WHAT? OF COURSE NOT.

15:23.223 --> 15:25.225
WHY WOULD YOU SAY
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

15:25.225 --> 15:27.227
I HEARD PORTER AND PRESTON

15:27.227 --> 15:31.131
FIGHTING ABOUT WHO'S GONNA GET
DADDY'S CAR WHEN HE DIES.

15:31.131 --> 15:33.203
OH.
THEY'RE JUST BEING SILLY.

15:33.203 --> 15:35.265
THEY'RE ALWAYS SILLY.

15:35.265 --> 15:38.368
THAT'S WHY WE WON'T BE SAD
WHEN THEY MOVE OUT OF THE HOUSE.

15:38.368 --> 15:40.340
COME ON.

15:44.474 --> 15:47.647
BUT EVERYBODY DIES SOMEDAY,
RIGHT?

15:47.647 --> 15:51.051
YES, BUT DADDY'S GONNA LIVE
TO A RIPE OLD AGE

15:51.051 --> 15:53.053
UNLESS HE DOESN'T GET HOME

15:53.053 --> 15:55.055
IN TIME
FOR MRS. McCLUSKEY'S PARTY,

15:55.055 --> 15:57.057
AND THEN ALL BETS ARE OFF.

15:57.057 --> 15:59.329
OH, DADDY'S GONNA BE FINE.
COME ON.

16:08.568 --> 16:10.270
(elevator bell dings)

16:12.372 --> 16:15.205
HI. MY HUSBAND--
I'M LYNETTE SCAVO.

16:15.205 --> 16:17.547
DR. BARON CALLED ME--
 I'M DR. BARON.

16:17.547 --> 16:20.280
OH. HI. WHAT HAPPENED?

16:20.280 --> 16:22.682
YOUR HUSBAND WAS WORKING
ON AN ELECTRICAL PANEL

16:22.682 --> 16:24.184
AT HIS RESTAURANT...
 UH-HUH.

16:24.184 --> 16:26.186
AND RECEIVED A MASSIVE SHOCK.

16:26.186 --> 16:29.559
ESSENTIALLY,
HIS HEART STOPPED PUMPING.
 (voice breaks) OH. IS HE...

16:29.559 --> 16:31.021
FORTUNATELY,

16:31.021 --> 16:33.023
THERE WAS A POLICEMAN
EATING IN THE RESTAURANT.

16:33.023 --> 16:35.425
HE ADMINISTERED C.P.R.
UNTIL THE AMBULANCE GOT THERE.

16:35.425 --> 16:37.367
(sighs deeply)

16:37.367 --> 16:39.469
SO HE'S OKAY?

16:39.469 --> 16:41.201
HIS HEART RESTARTED.

16:41.201 --> 16:43.703
NOW IT'S A MATTER OF DETERMINING
IF THERE'S ANY TISSUE DAMAGE.

16:43.703 --> 16:47.777
WE'RE OPTIMISTIC, BUT THE NEXT
36 HOURS ARE CRITICAL.

16:47.777 --> 16:51.781
(monitor beeping steadily)

16:51.781 --> 16:54.444
(woman) FATHER O'BRIEN,
PLEASE REPORT TO THE...

16:59.249 --> 17:00.590
HEY.

17:00.590 --> 17:02.622
HEY.

17:02.622 --> 17:05.295
(clears throat)
SO I'M THINKING

17:05.295 --> 17:08.358
NO MORE ELECTRICAL WORK,
OKAY?

17:08.358 --> 17:10.200
HUH?

17:10.200 --> 17:13.233
THE KIDS KNOW
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

17:13.233 --> 17:15.565
THEY SEND THEIR LOVE.

17:15.565 --> 17:19.108
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ANYTHING,
OKAY? JUST REST.

17:19.108 --> 17:21.810
I'LL COME BACK SOON, OKAY?

17:21.810 --> 17:24.473
YOU KNOW WHAT I THOUGHT?

17:24.473 --> 17:27.377
WHEN I WAS LYING THERE
ON THE FLOOR,

17:27.377 --> 17:31.751
I THOUGHT, I'M GONNA DIE
IN A PIZZA PLACE.

17:31.751 --> 17:34.754
I MEAN, MY WHOLE LIFE
WAS GONNA BE SUMMED UP

17:34.754 --> 17:36.586
WITH THIS OBITUARY HEADLINE--

17:36.586 --> 17:40.260
"LOCAL PIZZA SHOP OWNER DIES."

17:40.260 --> 17:42.592
BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT DYING.

17:42.592 --> 17:46.266
I NEED MORE, LYNETTE. I NEED--
TH-THERE'S GOTTA BE MORE.

17:46.266 --> 17:48.768
OKAY. OKAY. WE'LL FIND MORE.

17:48.768 --> 17:51.741
JUST REST NOW, OKAY?

17:58.308 --> 18:00.450
(horn honks)
 (Tom) HEY, SEXY.

18:03.283 --> 18:06.516
DROP THE RAKE AND GET IN.

18:06.516 --> 18:09.219
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

18:09.219 --> 18:13.593
THIS IS THE CAR THAT
I HAVE WANTED MY WHOLE LIFE.

18:13.593 --> 18:15.595
WHEN I WAS 12 YEARS OLD,

18:15.595 --> 18:18.568
I HAD A POSTER OF THIS BABY
UP ON MY WALL.

18:18.568 --> 18:21.571
AND WHEN I WAS 12, I HAD
A POSTER OF SHAUN CASSIDY,

18:21.571 --> 18:25.775
BUT YOU DON'T SEE ME
DRIVING AROUND IN HIM, DO YOU?
 I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

18:25.775 --> 18:28.878
WHAT, DO MACHINE GUNS COME OUT
OF THE HEADLIGHTS? (chuckles)

18:31.781 --> 18:34.544
I CARRY THIS AROUND
TO REMIND ME

18:34.544 --> 18:37.187
OF THE DAY
THAT I ALMOST DIED.

18:37.187 --> 18:42.192
THAT DAY YOU PROMISED ME
THAT WE WOULD FIND MORE.

18:42.192 --> 18:43.793
I'M KEEPING THE CAR.

18:49.859 --> 18:52.602
SO DO YOU WANT A RIDE?

18:58.308 --> 19:00.310
OOH!

19:06.376 --> 19:08.378
(honks horn)

19:08.378 --> 19:10.780
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

19:10.780 --> 19:13.283
SO HELP ME, IF McCLUSKEY
GETS THERE BEFORE US,

19:13.283 --> 19:15.925
I WILL BRAIN YOU.
 SORRY. LET'S GO.

19:15.925 --> 19:19.259
WELL, SHEESH. OH.

19:19.259 --> 19:21.761
SWEETIE, WE ALREADY
GOT KAREN A CANDLE.

19:21.761 --> 19:23.333
AN R.V. MIGHT BE OVERKILL.

19:23.333 --> 19:27.237
YEAH, BUT THAT'S NOT FOR HER.
THAT'S FOR US.

19:27.237 --> 19:28.468
(laughs)

19:28.468 --> 19:29.569
HUH?

19:29.569 --> 19:31.571
I'M ABOUT TO BLOW YOUR MIND,
LYNETTE.

19:31.571 --> 19:34.704
(chuckles) OH, DON'T.
I LIKE MY MIND THE WAY IT IS.

19:34.704 --> 19:36.706
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY
TO THE IDEA

19:36.706 --> 19:39.209
OF TAKING THE KIDS
OUT OF SCHOOL FOR A YEAR

19:39.209 --> 19:43.483
AND BOPPING AROUND THE COUNTRY
IN ONE OF THESE SWEET RIDES?

19:43.483 --> 19:45.355
(laughs)

19:45.355 --> 19:47.357
WELL, I MIGHT NOT
SAY ANYTHING.

19:47.357 --> 19:49.359
I MIGHT JUST PUT MY FINGER
TO MY EAR

19:49.359 --> 19:51.321
AND TWIRL IT
IN SMALL CIRCLES.

19:51.321 --> 19:55.925
WE CAN'T DO SOMETHING
LIKE THAT, TOM.
 YES, WE CAN. WE CAN DO
WHATEVER WE WANT. LIFE IS SHORT.

19:55.925 --> 19:58.197
OKAY, LET ME ASK YOU
ONE TINY QUESTION

19:58.197 --> 20:00.199
ABOUT THIS BIG ADVENTURE PLAN
OF YOURS.

20:00.199 --> 20:02.201
WHO'S GONNA BE RUNNING
OUR RESTAURANT

20:02.201 --> 20:04.334
WHILE WE'RE OFF DOING
THE ELECTRIC KOOL-AID ACID TEST?

20:04.334 --> 20:07.437
THAT WON'T BE OUR PROBLEM.
THE LAST FEW WEEKS,

20:07.437 --> 20:10.280
I'VE BEEN TALKING TO A GUY
FROM PASSENTINO'S PIZZA.

20:10.280 --> 20:12.282
THEY WANT TO BUY US OUT.

20:12.282 --> 20:15.685
(scoffs)
 THIS AFTERNOON, I SAID YES.

20:17.917 --> 20:19.889
HEY, GUYS.

20:19.889 --> 20:23.523
YOU READY TO PARTY?

20:34.003 --> 20:36.506
MOMENTS BEFORE SHE WAS DUE
AT HER FRIEND'S PARTY,

20:36.506 --> 20:39.609
BREE HODGE WAS AT THE MIRROR,
APPLYING HER EYELINER.

20:39.609 --> 20:41.271
AREN'T YOU DAPPER?

20:41.271 --> 20:43.413
WHEN I TELL EVERYONE
I'M YOUR NEW PARTNER,

20:43.413 --> 20:46.516
I WANT TO LOOK THE PART.
 IT WOULD NOT BE THE LAST TIME
THAT EVENING

20:46.516 --> 20:49.679
BREE WOULD FIND HERSELF...
 UM, ACTUALLY, DEAR...

20:49.679 --> 20:51.281
DRAWING A LINE.

20:51.281 --> 20:54.654
I'D RATHER YOU NOT TALK
ABOUT THE JOB TONIGHT.

20:54.654 --> 20:56.656
BUT, BREE, THIS IS
THE FIRST PARTY IN MONTHS

20:56.656 --> 20:58.758
WHEN I CAN ANSWER THE QUESTION,
"WHAT'S NEW?"

20:58.758 --> 21:03.032
WITHOUT MUMBLING
INTO MY DRINK.
 WELL, IT'S JUST VULGAR
TO DISCUSS BUSINESS AT A PARTY.

21:03.032 --> 21:05.735
MM. YOU HAVEN'T TOLD KATHERINE
YET, HAVE YOU?

21:05.735 --> 21:07.537
IT'S NOT THAT EASY.

21:07.537 --> 21:09.539
YOU KNOW SHE'LL BE FURIOUS.

21:09.539 --> 21:12.542
YES, BUT THE GREAT THING ABOUT
KATHERINE IS SHE'LL EXPRESS IT

21:12.542 --> 21:15.545
SO PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVELY,
WE'LL HARDLY NOTICE.

21:15.545 --> 21:18.978
LOOK, I KNOW SHE'S YOUR FRIEND,
BUT SHE'S ALSO OUR EMPLOYEE.

21:18.978 --> 21:21.050
WHY IS THIS SO DIFFICULT
FOR YOU?

21:21.050 --> 21:23.913
IT'S... COMPLICATED.

21:29.288 --> 21:33.423
WELL... ANOTHER DEAD SOLDIER.

21:33.423 --> 21:37.367
CAREFUL, DEAR. YOU DON'T WANT
TO BE ILL TOMORROW.

21:37.367 --> 21:39.369
YES. NOTHING LIKE A HEADACHE

21:39.369 --> 21:41.901
TO SPOIL A PERFECTLY NICE
FIRST DAY IN PRISON.

21:41.901 --> 21:43.603
(Bob and Lee chuckle)

21:43.603 --> 21:46.776
UH, WOULD ANYBODY LIKE
SOME MORE FRITTATA?

21:46.776 --> 21:49.439
IS MY WIFE AMAZING OR WHAT?
I MEAN, HOW MANY INMATES

21:49.439 --> 21:52.882
GET SENT OFF
WITH A FESTIVE CHAMPAGNE BRUNCH?

21:52.882 --> 21:54.884
UH, W-WHEN YOU'RE IN JAIL,

21:54.884 --> 21:57.316
YOU MIGHT WANT TO AVOID WORDS
LIKE "FESTIVE" AND "BRUNCH."

21:57.316 --> 21:59.919
THEY KIND OF SAY,
"HI. I'M HUSBAND HUNTING."

21:59.919 --> 22:01.721
(chuckles)

22:01.721 --> 22:03.353
ANDREW, PLEASE.

22:03.353 --> 22:04.594
IT'S FINE.

22:04.594 --> 22:07.597
THIS IS MY LAST TASTE OF FREEDOM
FOR THREE YEARS.

22:07.597 --> 22:09.959
I WANT JOKES.
I WANT FUN, LAUGHTER.

22:09.959 --> 22:11.961
ANYWAY, PRISON WON'T
BE SUCH A BIG CHANGE.

22:11.961 --> 22:15.505
YOU'RE A DENTIST.
YOU'RE USED TO CAVITY SEARCHES.

22:15.505 --> 22:17.937
YOU VOWED TO ME
THAT YOU WOULDN'T SAY THAT.

22:17.937 --> 22:20.009
(Orson chuckles)
 BREE TELLS ME

22:20.009 --> 22:23.112
THAT YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE
VERY GOOD USE OF YOUR TIME AWAY.
 MM.

22:23.112 --> 22:26.115
UH, YES. HE'S GOING TO READ
A LOT OF CLASSIC BOOKS,

22:26.115 --> 22:28.448
MAYBE STUDY A LANGUAGE.
 OH.

22:28.448 --> 22:30.450
YES, UH, HE CAN LEARN
THE ITALIAN FOR,

22:30.450 --> 22:32.582
"I COST FIVE CIGARETTES."
 (laughs)

22:32.582 --> 22:35.084
ANDREW, REALLY.

22:35.084 --> 22:37.927
BREE, HE'S JOKING.
EVERYTHING'S FINE...

22:37.927 --> 22:40.490
EXCEPT MY GLASS,

22:40.490 --> 22:42.792
WHICH SEEMS TO BE EMPTY.

23:12.892 --> 23:14.123
(sighs)

23:16.165 --> 23:17.997
BREE?

23:17.997 --> 23:19.769
BREE?

23:19.769 --> 23:22.131
OH, FOR GOD SAKE. GET UP.

23:22.131 --> 23:24.133
WE HAVE
THE GARDEN CLUB LUNCH IN...

23:27.437 --> 23:28.838
YOU'VE BEEN DRINKING?

23:28.838 --> 23:31.080
(moans)

23:31.080 --> 23:33.713
GO AWAY. I DON'T FEEL WELL.

23:33.713 --> 23:36.486
WE HAVE A LUNCH TO CATER.

23:36.486 --> 23:38.488
I'M TOO TIRED. CAN YOU DO IT?

23:43.623 --> 23:45.555
GET UP.

23:48.197 --> 23:51.130
OH.

23:51.130 --> 23:53.503
WHEN DID THIS START?

23:54.964 --> 23:58.037
WHEN ORSON LEFT, I...

23:58.037 --> 24:02.071
BEGAN HAVING A GLASS
OF WHITE WINE NOW AND THEN.

24:02.071 --> 24:04.143
THEN WHEN DANIELLE
TOOK BENJAMIN,

24:04.143 --> 24:08.478
I DIDN'T SEE ANY REASON
TO STOP AT JUST ONE.

24:08.478 --> 24:11.851
SO IS THIS WHY YOU MISSED
THE LUNCH LAST WEEK

24:11.851 --> 24:13.953
AND THE BRAVERMAN
BAR MITZVAH?

24:13.953 --> 24:16.626
I CAN'T HELP MYSELF,
ALL RIGHT?

24:16.626 --> 24:18.628
MY HUSBAND'S GONE.
MY SON'S GONE.

24:18.628 --> 24:20.459
I HAVE NOTHING LEFT.

24:20.459 --> 24:24.093
NO, ACTUALLY, YOU HAVE
A LUNCH FOR 40 IN 3 HOURS,

24:24.093 --> 24:27.166
AND I'M NOT LETTING YOU
OUT OF IT.
 OH, KATHERINE, PLEASE.

24:27.166 --> 24:29.168
OKAY, SO YOU HAVE
A VOID IN YOUR LIFE.

24:29.168 --> 24:32.071
WELCOME TO THE CLUB.
DON'T FILL IT WITH WINE.

24:32.071 --> 24:35.204
FILL IT WITH WORK,
WITH ACCOMPLISHMENTS.

24:35.204 --> 24:37.206
JUST THINK ABOUT
THE WOMAN YOU COULD BE

24:37.206 --> 24:40.009
BY THE TIME ORSON GETS BACK.

24:40.009 --> 24:43.112
OR IS THIS THE WOMAN
YOU WANT HIM TO COME HOME TO?

24:44.984 --> 24:47.587
HE'S GONNA BE
SO ASHAMED OF ME.

24:47.587 --> 24:50.620
NO, HE WON'T...

24:50.620 --> 24:53.492
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT
GONNA TELL HIM.

24:53.492 --> 24:55.765
YOU KNOW
HE'D JUST BLAME HIMSELF.

24:57.266 --> 25:00.229
I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN MAKE IT THIS TIME.

25:00.229 --> 25:03.002
YES, YOU WILL,

25:03.002 --> 25:05.535
BECAUSE I AM MOVING IN.

25:05.535 --> 25:08.507
YOU WOULD DO THAT?

25:08.507 --> 25:10.279
WHEN I HAD NOTHING,

25:10.279 --> 25:12.511
YOU MADE ME YOUR PARTNER.

25:12.511 --> 25:14.513
I'M NOT GONNA FORGET THAT.

25:16.215 --> 25:20.019
I AM GONNA GET YOU
THROUGH THIS.

25:20.019 --> 25:23.522
AND WHEN WE'RE DONE,
THAT SCARY WOMAN OVER THERE--

25:23.522 --> 25:26.055
SHE'S NEVER GONNA BE SEEN
IN THIS HOUSE AGAIN.

25:33.733 --> 25:35.735
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT,

25:35.735 --> 25:38.738
TONIGHT IS THE IDEAL TIME
FOR YOU TO TELL KATHERINE.

25:38.738 --> 25:40.770
THE PRESENCE
OF THE OTHER GUESTS

25:40.770 --> 25:42.772
WILL KEEP HER
FROM CAUSING A SCENE,

25:42.772 --> 25:45.775
AND AS WORD SPREADS
THAT WE'RE PARTNERS--
 AND HOW IS WORD
GOING TO SPREAD?

25:45.775 --> 25:47.777
I'LL BE SPREADING IT. PEOPLE
WILL BE CONGRATULATING ME,

25:47.777 --> 25:50.780
AND KATHERINE WILL HAVE TO
JOIN IN AND RISK LOOKING PETTY.
 AND SHE'LL BE TWICE AS MAD

25:50.780 --> 25:52.782
AT HAVING BEEN PUT
IN THAT POSITION.

25:52.782 --> 25:55.284
I AM NOT TELLING HER TONIGHT.
 FINE. THEN I WILL.

25:55.284 --> 25:58.287
NO, YOU WILL NOT.
I FORBID IT.
 YOU KNOW, FOR A PARTNER, YOU'RE
SOUNDING A LOT LIKE A BOSS.

25:58.287 --> 26:01.560
I AM TELLING HER.
 LOOK, IF WE CAN'T AGREE
ON SOMETHING THIS BASIC,

26:01.560 --> 26:04.563
MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T
WORK TOGETHER.
 WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

26:04.563 --> 26:06.565
I'M SAYING, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
RECONSIDER JOINING THE COMPANY.

26:06.565 --> 26:09.568
I HAVE NO INTENTION
OF RECONSIDERING.
 FINE. YOU'RE FIRED.

26:09.568 --> 26:11.240
HEY, GUYS.
YOU READY TO PARTY?

26:21.611 --> 26:23.753
(indistinct conversations)

26:23.753 --> 26:25.755
THE PARTY WAS IN FULL SWING,

26:25.755 --> 26:29.889
AND EVERYONE WAS WAITING
TO SURPRISE THE GUEST OF HONOR.

26:29.889 --> 26:31.791
LITTLE DID THEY KNOW,

26:31.791 --> 26:35.094
AN EVEN BIGGER SURPRISE
WAS ON ITS WAY.

26:35.094 --> 26:38.127
SORRY I'M LATE.
THERE WAS A LINE AT THE BAKERY.

26:38.127 --> 26:40.129
WELL,
YOU REALLY WENT ALL OUT.

26:40.129 --> 26:41.831
YEAH, SHE DESERVES IT.

26:57.046 --> 26:59.749
CAN I HELP YOU,
MRS. McCLUSKEY?

26:59.749 --> 27:02.852
THIS LETTER FOR EDIE
CAME TO MY HOUSE BY MISTAKE.

27:02.852 --> 27:06.355
I'M MAKING SURE THAT NONE
OF MY STUFF, UH, CAME HERE.

27:06.355 --> 27:08.127
WELL, IT'S ALL YOURS.

27:14.133 --> 27:16.235
(door closes)
 HEY.

27:16.235 --> 27:18.367
ANYTHING INTERESTING?

27:18.367 --> 27:20.309
FORTUNATELY, NO.

27:20.309 --> 27:22.311
I JUST SAW
YOUR FRIEND KAREN OUTSIDE.

27:22.311 --> 27:24.774
IS SHE STILL ASKING YOU
QUESTIONS ABOUT ME?

27:24.774 --> 27:26.776
A FEW, BUT DON'T TAKE IT
PERSONALLY.

27:26.776 --> 27:29.749
PRYING IS WHAT PEOPLE
TOO OLD TO HAVE SEX DO

27:29.749 --> 27:31.350
TO KEEP LIFE INTERESTING.

27:31.350 --> 27:34.123
SHE'S TURNING 70
NEXT WEEK.

27:34.123 --> 27:35.254
NO KIDDING.

27:35.254 --> 27:37.857
HEY,
WE SHOULD THROW HER A PARTY.

27:37.857 --> 27:40.790
I'M ALREADY TAKING HER OUT
FOR A DRINK. THAT'S PLENTY.

27:40.790 --> 27:42.291
SHE'LL BE 70, SWEETHEART.

27:42.291 --> 27:44.293
DON'T YOU THINK THAT CALLS
FOR SOMETHING BIGGER?

27:44.293 --> 27:45.795
LOOK, KAREN'S A FRIEND,

27:45.795 --> 27:47.997
BUT I DON'T LIKE
HAVING HER IN MY HOUSE.

27:47.997 --> 27:50.339
IT WOULD BE ONE THING

27:50.339 --> 27:54.203
IF WE HAD A BATHROOM WITH
A WINDOW YOU COULD OPEN, BUT...
 WELL, COULDN'T YOU ASK
SOMEONE ELSE TO HOST IT?

27:54.203 --> 27:58.047
WELL, I SUPPOSE I COULD
PALM IT OFF TO MAYER.

27:58.047 --> 28:01.811
GOOD. TELL HER WE'LL SUPPLY
THE FOOD AND LIQUOR.

28:01.811 --> 28:03.813
YOU KNOW,
KAREN'S NOT A FAN OF YOURS.

28:03.813 --> 28:06.455
WHY DO YOU WANT
TO THROW HER A PARTY?

28:06.455 --> 28:08.457
IT'S A BIG DAY FOR HER.

28:08.457 --> 28:11.120
I JUST WANT
TO MAKE SURE IT'S SPECIAL.

28:13.823 --> 28:16.395
SO...

28:16.395 --> 28:18.267
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

28:18.267 --> 28:20.269
I THINK THAT IS
ONE HELL OF AN OUTFIT

28:20.269 --> 28:22.832
TO WEAR
TO A 70th BIRTHDAY PARTY.

28:22.832 --> 28:24.403
IT'S MY GIFT TO KAREN.

28:24.403 --> 28:27.406
I FIGURE SHE'LL GET AT LEAST
FIVE GOOD BOOB JOKES OUT OF IT.

28:27.406 --> 28:29.408
WELL, SHE'LL BE HERE SOON,

28:29.408 --> 28:31.811
SO LET'S GO OVER THIS
ONE MORE TIME.

28:31.811 --> 28:33.813
OKAY. I TAKE HER HOME,

28:33.813 --> 28:36.816
THEN I COME UP WITH SOME EXCUSE
TO GET HER OVER TO SUSAN'S,

28:36.816 --> 28:39.218
WHERE EVERYONE JUMPS OUT
AND YELLS, "SURPRISE!"

28:39.218 --> 28:42.221
WHICH I STILL SAY
ISN'T THE SMARTEST THING TO DO

28:42.221 --> 28:45.224
TO A 70-YEAR-OLD.
 (knock on door)

28:45.224 --> 28:46.425
MRS. McCLUSKEY.

28:46.425 --> 28:48.828
HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

28:48.828 --> 28:51.861
JEEZ, EDIE, ARE WE GOING
FOR DRINKS OR MAMMOGRAMS?

28:51.861 --> 28:54.163
THAT'S ONE.

28:54.163 --> 28:57.166
OH, LET ME GRAB MY EARRINGS,
AND WE'RE GOOD TO GO.

28:58.908 --> 29:01.740
SO...

29:01.740 --> 29:02.942
70.

29:02.942 --> 29:05.344
IT'S QUITE A MILESTONE.

29:05.344 --> 29:07.076
HOW'S IT FEEL?

29:07.076 --> 29:10.249
NO BIG WHOOP.

29:12.451 --> 29:14.453
EDIE TOLD ME
THAT SHE TAKES YOU

29:14.453 --> 29:16.455
OUT FOR A BIRTHDAY DRINK
EVERY YEAR.

29:16.455 --> 29:18.858
I THINK
THAT'S A GREAT TRADITION.

29:21.030 --> 29:23.432
LOOK, I'M JUST TRYING
TO BE FRIENDS HERE.

29:23.432 --> 29:26.295
(Edie) ALL RIGHTY THEN.

29:26.295 --> 29:28.397
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.
 MM-HMM.

29:28.397 --> 29:31.440
COME ON. LET'S GO.

29:31.440 --> 29:34.143
I'VE GOT ENOUGH FRIENDS.

30:24.393 --> 30:27.396
(indistinct conversations)

30:30.159 --> 30:31.300
OH.

30:31.300 --> 30:33.062
WHERE'S KAREN?

30:33.062 --> 30:35.064
SHE'LL BE HERE AS SOON AS SHE
GIVES HER CAT SOME MEDICINE.
 MM.

30:35.064 --> 30:38.167
MM.
 DO I YOU THINK
SHE'LL BE SURPRISED?

30:38.167 --> 30:40.409
OH, ABSOLUTELY.

30:47.146 --> 30:49.048
(door squeaks)

30:49.048 --> 30:50.349
(keys thud)

30:52.621 --> 30:55.024
WHAT THE...

31:12.341 --> 31:15.244
DAVE.

31:20.209 --> 31:21.510
JUST SO I'M CLEAR,

31:21.510 --> 31:24.053
YOU WANT US TO SELL
OUR THRIVING BUSINESS

31:24.053 --> 31:26.355
SO WE CAN LIVE IN A BUS,
LIKE CARNIES?

31:26.355 --> 31:29.358
COME ON. THIS IS COOL.
WE CAN GO WHEREVER WE WANT.

31:29.358 --> 31:31.460
THE--THE KIDS
COULD SEE AMERICA.

31:31.460 --> 31:33.662
AND WHEN WE START STEALING
TO SUPPORT OURSELVES,

31:33.662 --> 31:35.664
THE KIDS CAN SEE
THE INSIDE OF A PRISON.

31:35.664 --> 31:38.027
YOU'RE RIGHT, TOM.
IT'S A BRILLIANT IDEA.

31:38.027 --> 31:41.200
DAMN IT, LYNETTE. WHY DO YOU
HAVE TO BE SUCH A BUZZ KILL?

31:41.200 --> 31:44.203
WHY CAN'T YOU, JUST ONCE,
GIVE ME A LITTLE SUPPORT?

31:44.203 --> 31:47.336
FINE. (scoffs)
I'LL GET YOU A TOWEL.

31:47.336 --> 31:48.978
FOR WHAT?

31:51.440 --> 31:53.442
BREE, YOU CAN'T FIRE ME,

31:53.442 --> 31:56.145
NOT AFTER ALL THE SACRIFICES
I MADE FOR YOU.

31:56.145 --> 31:58.217
ORSON, STOP THROWING JAIL
IN MY FACE.

31:58.217 --> 32:00.219
YOU CELLMATE WAS
A CROOKED C.P.A.

32:00.219 --> 32:03.122
WHO HELPED YOU FORM A BRIDGE
CLUB. IT WASN'T EXACTLY ATTICA.

32:03.122 --> 32:04.693
BREE, I NEED THIS JOB.

32:04.693 --> 32:08.057
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT IT'S
LIKE TO WAKE UP EVERY MORNING

32:08.057 --> 32:10.359
AND HAVE NO REASON
TO GET OUT OF BED?

32:10.359 --> 32:12.361
TO SMILE AND NOD
AT NEIGHBORS

32:12.361 --> 32:15.504
WHO KNOW
YOUR WIFE'S SUPPORTING YOU

32:15.504 --> 32:18.307
BECAUSE NO ONE
WILL HIRE A FELON?

32:18.307 --> 32:21.140
I AM DROWNING, AND FOR YOU
TO THROW ME A LIFELINE

32:21.140 --> 32:24.143
AND THEN SNATCH IT AWAY--
 ORSON, I SHOULD HAVE NEVER
OFFERED YOU THAT JOB.

32:24.143 --> 32:26.445
IT WASN'T FAIR TO KATHERINE.
 I AM YOUR HUSBAND.

32:26.445 --> 32:30.319
WHY ARE YOU PUTTING KATHERINE'S
FEELINGS AHEAD OF MINE?
 ORSON, PLEASE.

32:30.319 --> 32:34.323
YOU'RE PUTTING ME
IN AN IMPOSSIBLE POSITION.
 THEN LET ME
MAKE IT SIMPLER FOR YOU.

32:34.323 --> 32:35.724
I WANT A DIVORCE.

32:40.489 --> 32:41.460
HI.

32:41.460 --> 32:43.492
KATHERINE, GREAT DRESS.

32:43.492 --> 32:47.136
YOU'RE GONNA TURN SOME HEADS
WITH THAT ONE.

32:47.136 --> 32:49.168
I HOPE YOU'RE ENJOYING
THIS PARTY, CARLOS,

32:49.168 --> 32:51.500
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GONNA LIVE
TO SEE ANOTHER ONE.

32:51.500 --> 32:54.203
LOOK, I'M SORRY THAT I LIED,
AND FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,

32:54.203 --> 32:57.206
THE GUILT
HAS BEEN TEARING ME APART.
 YOU KNOW WHAT'S
GONNA TEAR ME APART?

32:57.206 --> 32:59.308
ANOTHER 10-POUND BABY
SHOOTING OUT MY HOO-HA.

32:59.308 --> 33:01.380
HONEY, LOOK AT IT THIS WAY,

33:01.380 --> 33:04.513
GOD BLESSED US AGAIN BECAUSE
YOU ARE SUCH A GREAT MOM.

33:04.513 --> 33:07.356
OH. GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME,
YOU SELFISH SON OF A BITCH.

33:07.356 --> 33:09.318
(thud)

33:12.391 --> 33:14.393
I TOLD YOU I LOVE YOU.

33:14.393 --> 33:16.665
DOESN'T THAT MEAN ANYTHING
TO YOU?

33:16.665 --> 33:18.697
YES. IT MEANS
THAT SOMEONE FORGOT

33:18.697 --> 33:21.370
THAT WE HAD AN AGREEMENT
TO KEEP THINGS CASUAL.

33:21.370 --> 33:24.673
WOW. OKAY.

33:24.673 --> 33:27.376
SO IF WE'RE NOT
IN A RELATIONSHIP,

33:27.376 --> 33:30.709
IF I WAS WITH ANOTHER WOMAN,
THAT WOULDN'T BOTHER YOU?

33:30.709 --> 33:32.541
NO, IT WOULDN'T.

33:35.514 --> 33:37.015
MM.

33:39.518 --> 33:41.350
QUIET, EVERYONE.

33:41.350 --> 33:43.152
SHE'S COMING. MOVE IT.

33:51.029 --> 33:53.102
(all) SURPRISE!

33:53.102 --> 33:56.535
YOU THINK
YOU CAN SCREW WITH ME?

34:00.469 --> 34:03.472
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

34:03.472 --> 34:05.274
AAH!

34:05.274 --> 34:07.546
KAREN, WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

34:07.546 --> 34:09.547
ASK THAT HUSBAND OF YOURS!
 (Edie) NO!

34:09.547 --> 34:13.552
LET'S NOT BE DOING THAT.
 NO, THAT MAN BROKE
INTO MY HOUSE TONIGHT!

34:13.552 --> 34:16.554
WHAT?
 YES, AND HE--
AND HE MOVED THINGS AROUND,

34:16.554 --> 34:19.458
AND HE--AND HE TOOK A PICTURE
OFF THE WALL,

34:19.458 --> 34:22.431
AND THEN HE PUT THE TABLE
NEXT TO THE COUCH,

34:22.431 --> 34:25.434
AND THE DISH FOR THE KEYS--
IT'S ALWAYS BY THE...
 SHH.

34:25.434 --> 34:27.436
IT'S ALWAYS BY THE DOOR.

34:27.436 --> 34:30.569
AND THAT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME
HE'S BROKEN IN EITHER.

34:30.569 --> 34:33.542
HE STOLE MY CAT,
AND THEN HE PUT HIM BACK.

34:33.542 --> 34:37.545
OKAY, MRS. McCLUSKEY,
WHY WOULD I DO THOSE THINGS?

34:39.447 --> 34:41.449
KAREN, I HATE TO SAY IT,

34:41.449 --> 34:44.453
BUT YOU'RE NOT MAKING
A LOT OF SENSE RIGHT NOW.

34:44.453 --> 34:46.585
MAYBE YOU NEED TO LIE DOWN.

34:48.657 --> 34:51.460
YOU...
 HEY!

34:51.460 --> 34:53.292
I THINK
WE SHOULD CALL 9-1-1.

34:53.292 --> 34:55.224
LET GO OF ME!

34:55.224 --> 34:59.828
WHY ARE YOU ALL ACTING
LIKE I'M CRAZY?

34:59.828 --> 35:02.231
(Gabrielle) WHOO!

35:02.231 --> 35:04.773
HALLE-DAMN-LUJAH,
I GOT MY PERIOD!

35:08.137 --> 35:10.579
OH, WAS SHE SURPRISED?

35:18.487 --> 35:22.451
SHE SEEMED TOTALLY DISORIENTED,
BABBLING.

35:22.451 --> 35:24.623
I JUST HOPE
IT ISN'T DEMENTIA.

35:24.623 --> 35:28.227
SHE LIVES BY HERSELF.

35:28.227 --> 35:29.598
WE'LL ALERT THE HOSPITAL.

35:29.598 --> 35:32.901
WE'RE GONNA NEED
A PSYCH EVALUATION.
 THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

35:32.901 --> 35:35.404
(sighs)

35:35.404 --> 35:39.408
POOR KAREN.
I HOPE SHE'S OKAY.

35:39.408 --> 35:41.640
YEAH, ME, TOO.

35:44.273 --> 35:46.375
WE SHOULD PROBABLY TALK NOW,
HUH?

35:46.375 --> 35:48.847
YEAH. LET'S TALK.

35:53.752 --> 35:56.585
DOES THIS RELATIONSHIP
HAVE A FUTURE?

35:56.585 --> 36:02.261
JACKSON, WHAT WE HAVE HERE
HAS BEEN WORKING PRETTY WELL.

36:02.261 --> 36:03.662
ANSWER THE QUESTION.

36:05.394 --> 36:08.267
CAN'T WE JUST KEEP GOING
THE WAY WE ARE?

36:11.200 --> 36:13.372
AND THERE'S MY ANSWER.

36:20.479 --> 36:24.513
(siren wailing)
 IT SEEMS LIKE THEY'RE
TAKING GOOD CARE OF HER.

36:30.589 --> 36:33.522
I HOPE YOU DIDN'T MEAN
WHAT YOU SAID EARLIER.

36:33.522 --> 36:35.964
YOU JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT I OWE TO KATHERINE.

36:35.964 --> 36:39.428
YOU'RE RIGHT. I DON'T.

36:39.428 --> 36:40.729
YOU STARTED THE COMPANY

36:40.729 --> 36:43.732
AND GAVE HER A JOB
WHEN SHE NEEDED ONE BADLY.

36:43.732 --> 36:46.435
WHY ARE YOU
 THE ONE WHO OWES HER?

36:48.607 --> 36:51.610
YOU KNOW THAT...

36:51.610 --> 36:54.943
BRUNCH WE HAD FOR YOU RIGHT
BEFORE YOU LEFT FOR PRISON?

36:56.815 --> 36:58.817
(whispering)
I WAS VERY TENSE,

36:58.817 --> 37:01.720
AND I WAS VERY UNHAPPY.

37:03.792 --> 37:07.726
SO I HAD...

37:07.726 --> 37:11.300
A GLASS OF CHAMPAGNE.

37:16.835 --> 37:18.837
SHE'S TOUGH.

37:18.837 --> 37:20.839
I'M SURE SHE'LL BE OKAY.

37:20.839 --> 37:23.612
HOW ABOUT THE CRAZY
MARRIED COUPLE THROWING DRINKS?

37:23.612 --> 37:26.415
HOW ARE THEY GONNA BE?

37:26.415 --> 37:28.417
YOU KNOW, I JUST THOUGHT
THAT YOU GOT IT,

37:28.417 --> 37:31.280
THAT YOU KNEW WHAT I WAS GOING
THROUGH AFTER MY ACCIDENT.

37:31.280 --> 37:33.282
YOU KNOW,
OBVIOUSLY I WAS WRONG.

37:33.282 --> 37:35.984
NO, I GET IT. THE SPORTS CAR,
THE GARAGE BAND...

37:35.984 --> 37:38.987
MAYBE WHAT WE NEED NOW, TOM,
IF FOR YOU TO GET IT.

37:38.987 --> 37:42.260
HEY, I WAS
THE ONE LAYING ON THE FLOOR

37:42.260 --> 37:44.262
WITH A COP
POUNDING ON MY CHEST.

37:44.262 --> 37:47.265
AND I HAD CANCER.
I GET IT. I GET IT.

37:47.265 --> 37:49.368
YOU WANT YOUR LIFE
TO COUNT FOR SOMETHING.

37:49.368 --> 37:52.371
EXACTLY. I JUST DON'T WANT
TO KEEP MAKING PIZZAS EVERY DAY

37:52.371 --> 37:55.444
TILL I DROP TO THE FLOOR
FOR REAL.

37:55.444 --> 37:58.877
I WANT MY LIFE TO BE EXCITING.
YOU KNOW, I NEED ADVENTURE.

37:58.877 --> 38:01.880
SCAVO'S WAS THE ADVENTURE.
WE CHANGED OUR WHOLE LIVES

38:01.880 --> 38:05.314
SO YOU COULD LIVE OUT YOUR
DREAM, AND NOW YOU'RE BORED.

38:05.314 --> 38:07.285
WE CAN'T KEEP DOING THIS,
TOM.

38:07.285 --> 38:10.288
WE CAN'T KEEP THROWING
ALL THE CARDS UP IN THE AIR

38:10.288 --> 38:12.561
EVERY TIME YOU GET
A LITTLE RESTLESS.

38:12.561 --> 38:15.424
LET'S CALL IT A NIGHT.

38:15.424 --> 38:17.426
WE HAVE TO WORK TOMORROW.

38:23.402 --> 38:24.773
ARE YOU COMING?

38:30.639 --> 38:32.741
I'LL COME WHEN I'M READY.

38:40.619 --> 38:43.952
DID SHE REALLY NEED
AN AMBULANCE?

38:43.952 --> 38:46.525
I DON'T KNOW.

38:46.525 --> 38:49.858
BUT YOU WOULD HAVE
IF I HADN'T STARTED MY PERIOD.

38:49.858 --> 38:52.661
HOW COULD YOU
HAVE DONE THIS?

38:52.661 --> 38:55.964
ISN'T IT OBVIOUS?
I WANT ANOTHER KID.
 WE CAN'T HANDLE ANOTHER KID.

38:55.964 --> 38:59.067
WE'RE LIVING HAND TO MOUTH
AS IT IS.
 THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID
BEFORE WE HAD JUANITA

38:59.067 --> 39:01.770
AND BEFORE WE HAD CELIA,
AND SOMEHOW WE MANAGE.

39:01.770 --> 39:03.772
AND CAN YOU IMAGINE OUR LIVES
WITHOUT THEM?

39:03.772 --> 39:06.975
OF COURSE I CAN'T.
IT'S JUST...

39:06.975 --> 39:08.977
HOW COULD YOU HAVE LIED
TO ME?

39:13.422 --> 39:15.384
I JUST COULDN'T SHAKE

39:15.384 --> 39:20.589
THE IDEA THAT MAYBE GOD HAD ONE
MORE MIRACLE IN STORE FOR US.

39:20.589 --> 39:21.760
MAYBE A SON.

39:21.760 --> 39:24.693
AND WE HAVE SO MUCH LOVE
IN OUR LIVES,

39:24.693 --> 39:27.536
I GOT GREEDY,
AND I WANTED MORE.

39:29.638 --> 39:30.939
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT.

39:30.939 --> 39:33.702
IT WAS SELFISH AND STUPID,
AND I AM SO SORRY.

39:33.702 --> 39:37.706
I WILL CALL TOMORROW
AND SCHEDULE A VASECTOMY.

39:40.879 --> 39:44.613
OR... WE USE BIRTH CONTROL,

39:44.613 --> 39:46.855
AND I'M TALKING
DOUBLE-BAGGING,

39:46.855 --> 39:49.858
AT LEAST UNTIL WE BOTH DECIDE
IT'S A GOOD IDEA.

39:49.858 --> 39:51.960
WOW.

39:54.523 --> 39:57.796
I THINK I GOTTA KISS YOU.

40:00.098 --> 40:03.101
AND UNTIL WE GET A BOX
OF CONDOMS IN THAT HOUSE,

40:03.101 --> 40:04.633
THAT'S ALL YOU'RE GETTIN'.

40:10.138 --> 40:12.481
ORSON. WHAT'S UP?

40:12.481 --> 40:15.684
BREE TOLD ME WHAT YOU DID
FOR HER WHEN I WAS IN PRISON.

40:15.684 --> 40:17.686
I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU.

40:17.686 --> 40:19.187
IT'S NOTHING.

40:19.187 --> 40:22.020
NOT TO BREE OR ME.

40:22.020 --> 40:25.023
AND YOU WERE DEAD RIGHT
TO STOP HER FROM TELLING ME.

40:25.023 --> 40:28.757
I'D CONSIDER IT AN HONOR
TO WORK FOR SOMEBODY THAT WISE.

40:28.757 --> 40:30.459
WORK FOR?

40:30.459 --> 40:32.731
THE LAST I HEARD,
IT WAS PARTNER.

40:32.731 --> 40:34.563
ALL RIGHT, HOW'S THIS?

40:34.563 --> 40:36.565
I'LL BECOME A PARTNER...

40:36.565 --> 40:39.568
BUT ONLY AFTER
YOU DECIDE I'VE EARNED IT.

40:39.568 --> 40:41.069
I'M A PATIENT MAN.

40:41.069 --> 40:43.642
I DON'T CARE
IF IT TAKES TWO YEARS.

40:43.642 --> 40:46.515
OH, HONEY...

40:46.515 --> 40:48.016
WORKING FOR BREE--

40:48.016 --> 40:50.178
YOU'RE NOT GONNA LAST
TEN MONTHS.

40:55.684 --> 40:58.226
MIND IF I SAY GOOD-BYE
TO OUR GIRL?

40:58.226 --> 41:01.029
SURE,
BUT SHE'S A LITTLE GROGGY.

41:11.900 --> 41:16.575
YOU PLANNED THE WHOLE THING.

41:16.575 --> 41:18.707
YOU'RE TRYING
TO GET RID OF ME.

41:18.707 --> 41:22.751
YES.

41:22.751 --> 41:25.253
AND I'M SORRY
IT HAD TO BE YOU.

41:26.855 --> 41:30.188
'CAUSE I KNOW
YOU'RE UP TO SOMETHING--

41:30.188 --> 41:32.090
SOMETHING AWFUL.

41:34.022 --> 41:36.665
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT "AWFUL" IS.

41:40.569 --> 41:42.500
YOU TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF,
KAREN,

41:42.500 --> 41:43.932
AND I MEAN THAT.

41:59.948 --> 42:05.153
YES, IT WAS A NIGHT
FILLED WITH SURPRISES.

42:06.555 --> 42:07.956
(door opens)

42:07.956 --> 42:09.658
SOME HAD LEARNED

42:09.658 --> 42:12.260
OF THEIR HUSBAND'S PLANS
FOR THE FUTURE...

42:13.762 --> 42:18.006
OTHERS HAD DISCOVERED THE TRUTH
OF THEIR WIFE'S PAST...

42:20.569 --> 42:24.643
SOME WERE TOUCHED BY THEIR
HUSBAND'S SECRET LONGINGS...

42:27.616 --> 42:32.821
OTHERS WERE HURT BY
THEIR LOVER'S QUICK DEPARTURE.

42:32.821 --> 42:34.322
BUT FOR ONE RESIDENT,

42:34.322 --> 42:37.155
THE EVENING
HAD GONE AS PLANNED,

42:37.155 --> 42:40.859
AND HE NOW TURNED HIS THOUGHTS
TO HIS REAL AGENDA.

42:45.734 --> 42:47.736
IT WOULDN'T BE LONG NOW

42:47.736 --> 42:51.640
BEFORE HE DESTROYED THE MAN
WHO HAD RUINED HIS LIFE,

42:51.640 --> 42:54.773
BUT HE KNEW
HE HAD TO MOVE CAREFULLY.

42:54.773 --> 42:59.678
AFTER ALL, HE WANTED IT
TO BE A SURPRISE.
