00:28.094 --> 00:30.063
- Excuse me, Dr. King?
- I'm sorry.

00:30.064 --> 00:32.399
I don't have any more time.
I'm already late for my plane.

00:32.400 --> 00:34.867
My name's Annie Parker.

00:37.837 --> 00:39.773
Oh.

00:40.675 --> 00:43.143
I read your letters.

00:43.144 --> 00:45.612
I heard you were in town.

00:45.613 --> 00:49.149
I tried to catch your lecture,
but... the traffic was horrible.

00:49.150 --> 00:51.117
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

00:51.118 --> 00:54.787
It was a bit dry. My jokes
didn't play very well.

00:57.123 --> 01:00.226
- That's a pretty necklace.
- Thank you.

01:00.227 --> 01:04.696
It was my mom's. I had
it restrung recently.

01:04.831 --> 01:06.333
- You know, she...
- Hey, I'm sorry.

01:06.334 --> 01:11.804
I really do have to go. I hope we
can speak again. All the best.

01:31.057 --> 01:36.628
Oh, you might feel some
discomfort. Just relax.

01:47.607 --> 01:50.910
<i>There are great mysteries out there.</i>

01:50.911 --> 01:54.080
<i>Strange and magical,</i>

01:54.081 --> 01:56.782
<i>hidden in codes.</i>

01:58.952 --> 02:00.920
<i>Did you ever wonder...</i>

02:00.921 --> 02:05.525
<i>if you knew those codes,
could you change your future?</i>

02:23.143 --> 02:25.779
- Slap.
- Snap.

02:25.780 --> 02:30.617
<i>That's my big sister Joan
and I. She knew things.</i>

02:30.618 --> 02:34.020
That's where Death hides
when he comes to the house.

02:34.021 --> 02:36.122
He sleeps most of the time.

02:36.123 --> 02:40.726
But you should be very quiet when
you're up here so you don't wake him up.

02:42.729 --> 02:45.265
Did Mommy wake him up?

02:45.266 --> 02:48.367
Yes, she did.

02:51.971 --> 02:56.208
She blew it, and now we
don't have a mommy anymore.

02:59.546 --> 03:02.349
And he'll get us too
if we're not careful,

03:02.350 --> 03:05.883
like he did Grandma and Aunt Lil.

03:07.654 --> 03:11.291
- Snap.
- Snap.

03:11.292 --> 03:13.926
<i>And this is my story.</i>

03:23.403 --> 03:27.440
<i>Some girls love to run around</i>

03:27.441 --> 03:31.277
<i>Like to handle everything they see</i>

03:31.278 --> 03:35.081
<i>But my girl has more fun around</i>

03:35.082 --> 03:38.518
<i>And you know she'd rather be with me</i>

03:38.519 --> 03:40.220
<i>Me-oh my</i>

03:40.221 --> 03:44.124
<i>Lucky guy is what I am</i>

03:44.125 --> 03:48.061
<i>Tell you why you'll understand</i>

03:48.062 --> 03:53.231
<i>She don't fly although she can</i>

03:54.467 --> 03:58.171
<i>Some boys like to run around</i>

03:58.172 --> 04:02.008
<i>They don't think about
the things they do</i>

04:02.009 --> 04:05.778
<i>But this boy wants to settle down</i>

04:05.779 --> 04:09.549
<i>And you know he'd rather be with you</i>

04:09.550 --> 04:14.319
<i>Me-oh my, lucky guy
is what I am...</i>

04:14.320 --> 04:17.656
<i>That's me, not as
confident as I should be,</i>

04:17.658 --> 04:21.427
<i>so I would make up for it
by making bad choices.</i>

04:21.428 --> 04:24.796
<i>That's my sister Joan all grown up.</i>

04:25.665 --> 04:29.502
<i>And that's Joan's best friend Louise, who
my dad said was trouble with a capital T,</i>

04:29.503 --> 04:32.939
<i>which made Joan, who was always
good, like her even more.</i>

04:32.940 --> 04:35.408
<i>That's Paul, who was
sweet and funny.</i>

04:35.409 --> 04:39.212
<i>We fell in love and got
engaged when I was only 18...</i>

04:39.213 --> 04:42.182
<i>always a good idea...
and later got married</i>

04:42.183 --> 04:44.817
<i>because he was sweet but also
because he had a great ass</i>

04:44.818 --> 04:47.187
<i>which was like a piece
of pneumatic machinery.</i>

04:47.188 --> 04:51.891
<i>Thumpity thumpity thumpity thump.
Thumpity thumpity thump.</i>

04:51.892 --> 04:54.427
<i>He was going to be a
musician, which is hard,</i>

04:54.428 --> 04:58.364
<i>so until then, he was working
as a pool cleaner...</i>

04:58.365 --> 05:00.733
<i>in Toronto.</i>

05:01.335 --> 05:04.237
<i>My dad died suddenly in 1972.</i>

05:04.238 --> 05:07.507
<i>I guess that's where
we should start.</i>

05:08.209 --> 05:13.011
Give heed, O Lord, to my
prayer, the sound of my voice.

05:15.715 --> 05:19.451
- You ready to go?
- I need another minute.

05:27.193 --> 05:29.928
- I'm gonna stay here.
- Okay.

05:33.032 --> 05:35.768
<i>People behave oddly
around the bereaved.</i>

05:35.769 --> 05:36.903
Hey.

05:36.904 --> 05:38.905
<i>They can't help themselves.</i>

05:38.906 --> 05:42.041
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

05:42.443 --> 05:47.913
- You're, like, one of the main mourners?
- Excuse me?

05:48.415 --> 05:51.450
I don't mean in a bad way.

05:54.855 --> 05:57.022
So...

05:57.524 --> 06:01.192
what are you doing after this?

06:02.428 --> 06:05.098
After this is the wake.

06:05.099 --> 06:07.399
Right.

06:07.501 --> 06:10.469
But after that?

06:19.812 --> 06:22.148
So you think your mother suffered?

06:22.149 --> 06:25.418
My wife went through
18 months of agony.

06:25.419 --> 06:30.657
To lose your mother and your father.
I can't imagine how lonely that must be.

06:30.658 --> 06:34.094
Every day it was worse.
That's suffering.

06:34.095 --> 06:39.032
Just to be by yourself.
It must be so painful,

06:39.033 --> 06:42.268
so lonely.

06:43.170 --> 06:48.406
<i>She was wrong, of course. My parents
were gone, but I had my sister, Joan.</i>

06:49.809 --> 06:52.977
<i>And we didn't know
what trouble we were in.</i>

06:55.081 --> 06:58.651
So I have to ask, Dr. King. What's
the story with the clock there?

06:58.652 --> 07:00.386
The clock is marked
at every 12 minutes.

07:00.387 --> 07:03.556
That's how often a woman will die
of breast cancer in this country.

07:03.557 --> 07:05.658
- Well, that's...
- One in nine.

07:05.659 --> 07:07.994
Two million over the next 20 years.

07:07.995 --> 07:12.365
- Potentially, but...
- Maybe your wife. Your daughter.

07:12.366 --> 07:15.369
I think what Dr. King means...

07:15.370 --> 07:19.238
is that the disease, along
with a potential cure,

07:19.239 --> 07:22.809
is of interest to a vast number
of people... a cross section...

07:22.810 --> 07:26.012
I'm sorry, Allen. I just... I wanna
be clear about this, Dr. King.

07:26.013 --> 07:30.917
You believe that there may be a
genetic link to some breast cancers?

07:30.918 --> 07:32.685
I do.

07:32.686 --> 07:35.722
Even though virtually no one
else believes this to be true?

07:35.723 --> 07:37.957
That's correct.

07:38.459 --> 07:41.661
And to prove your theory, you're
going to have to examine the...

07:41.662 --> 07:44.063
- The human genome.
- The human genome, which has...

07:44.064 --> 07:48.599
- 100,000 genes.
- Or so, give or take a few.

07:51.204 --> 07:54.340
And how many women are in your study?

07:54.341 --> 07:58.111
- We began with several thousand.
- Not so many.

07:58.112 --> 08:00.547
And you'd have to
interview them all, yes?

08:00.548 --> 08:04.182
Most. Uh-huh. Yes.

08:05.818 --> 08:10.322
100,000 genes, several
thousand women,

08:10.323 --> 08:12.025
and no certain outcome?

08:12.026 --> 08:14.394
Of course, we're already
well into our research.

08:14.395 --> 08:18.730
- Oh, well, how far along are you?
- Um...

08:22.735 --> 08:26.404
So, 74...

08:26.473 --> 08:29.642
No, no. Um...

08:29.643 --> 08:33.145
- six more.
- Uh-huh.

08:33.746 --> 08:36.313
So, 80...

08:38.885 --> 08:41.653
Um...

08:46.292 --> 08:50.297
Right. Well, thank you. Thank you so
much for your time and your hospitality.

08:50.298 --> 08:53.466
We'll... we'll be in touch. And
we're obviously very interested

08:53.467 --> 08:57.068
in helping you with something
so important, so...

09:05.344 --> 09:08.681
- I can't see it, Allen. I'm sorry.
- Can't see it?

09:08.682 --> 09:10.550
We're looking at something
like 20 years here.

09:10.551 --> 09:12.986
- Yeah, but Dr. King thinks...
- Dr. King thinks.

09:12.987 --> 09:15.788
She thinks. Nobody else thinks.

09:15.789 --> 09:17.857
What is it about people
like Mary-Claire King

09:17.858 --> 09:20.393
that think the world
owes them a living, huh?

09:20.394 --> 09:24.263
She's like that grasshopper
with his little violin.

09:24.264 --> 09:25.565
- Pardon?
- Grasshopper.

09:25.566 --> 09:30.436
You know, he plays his little violin.
He says, "The world owes me a living."

09:30.437 --> 09:33.473
Give him a PhD, there's your
doctor friend right there.

09:33.474 --> 09:39.145
You're comparing one of our most brilliant
geneticists to a cartoon grasshopper?

09:39.146 --> 09:44.016
The answer's no, Allen.
So let's leave it alone, huh?

09:44.017 --> 09:46.019
Sorry.

09:47.421 --> 09:49.589
He didn't like me, did he?

09:49.590 --> 09:52.158
He... No.

09:52.159 --> 09:55.761
- I'm sure that...
- What did he say?

09:55.762 --> 09:59.932
He compared you to an
animated grasshopper.

09:59.933 --> 10:03.001
Did he? Goodness.

10:03.403 --> 10:06.505
Well, that's sort of
charming in a way.

10:06.907 --> 10:09.408
- Did you tell him about the...
- No, I...

10:09.409 --> 10:12.044
- He wasn't having any of it.
- We could...

10:12.045 --> 10:14.546
Okay. I see.

10:15.048 --> 10:18.250
So, thank you...

10:18.752 --> 10:21.553
for coming out.

10:25.591 --> 10:29.562
- What will you do?
- What will I do? My work.

10:29.563 --> 10:32.297
I'll do my work.

10:35.668 --> 10:37.470
I do

10:37.471 --> 10:40.907
I think about you day and night

10:40.908 --> 10:45.378
It's only right to think
about the girl you love

10:45.379 --> 10:47.880
And hold her tight

10:47.881 --> 10:52.418
So happy together

10:52.419 --> 10:58.457
I can't see me loving nobody but you

10:58.458 --> 11:02.028
For all my life

11:02.029 --> 11:05.731
When you're with me, da-da-da

11:05.732 --> 11:07.233
Blue, da-da

11:07.234 --> 11:10.803
You for all my life

11:10.804 --> 11:13.039
Imagine me and you

11:13.040 --> 11:15.708
I do

11:15.709 --> 11:19.644
Wow. Sweet.

11:19.769 --> 11:23.769
<i>It's only right to think
about the girl you love</i>

11:23.770 --> 11:28.970
<i>And hold her tight so happy together</i>

11:30.389 --> 11:35.961
<i>Yeah, yeah. I know. But we were young,
and we had lots of time on our hands.</i>

11:39.565 --> 11:42.401
That is playing with
your food, which is bad.

11:42.402 --> 11:45.937
These are your sister Joanie's
tomatoes, so, technically,

11:45.938 --> 11:51.143
I'm playing with Joanie's food. I'm
playing with Joanie's tomatoes.

11:51.144 --> 11:53.746
- I think he has a point.
- I don't like tomatoes.

11:53.747 --> 11:55.748
- I don't like tomatoes.
- I do have a point.

11:55.749 --> 11:57.583
- I like tomatoes.
- No, you don't.

11:57.584 --> 12:00.453
- You do? I didn't know that.
- Then you can have my tomatoes.

12:00.454 --> 12:02.488
Paul, give Louise my tomatoes.

12:02.489 --> 12:05.625
No, I don't need any tomatoes. I just...
You guys are so cute together.

12:05.626 --> 12:08.327
And I hear the thumpity thump is...

12:08.328 --> 12:10.429
- Joan!
- Louise!

12:10.430 --> 12:11.998
The what? The thumpity what?

12:11.999 --> 12:13.966
- I think they probably...
- I can't believe you told her.

12:13.967 --> 12:16.002
- I didn't know it was a secret.
- Nothing.

12:16.003 --> 12:18.638
I told them you were good at
vegetable animals. Really good.

12:18.639 --> 12:21.607
I like to think that my
work speaks for itself.

12:21.608 --> 12:24.777
- So lifelike.
- I can't believe you told her.

12:24.778 --> 12:28.014
This is gonna go down in history
as the greatest vegetable animal

12:28.015 --> 12:30.016
- ...of all time, ever.
- I didn't tell her much.

12:30.017 --> 12:34.053
Of all time. Do you see this dinosaur
that I've created in this restaurant?

12:34.054 --> 12:35.922
- Excuse me. Look at this.
- No.

12:35.923 --> 12:37.335
It's not a real dinosaur.

12:37.336 --> 12:42.862
It's a triceratops made of fruit and
vegetables. Don't be afraid. It's gentle.

12:42.863 --> 12:45.097
- See?
- We call him Larry.

12:45.098 --> 12:47.833
You smell like fruit, Larry.

12:47.834 --> 12:50.869
- You smell like cantaloupe.
- I'm sorry you're a prude.

12:53.940 --> 12:58.577
Let's conclude. We have a
proposition, a thesis of sorts,

12:58.578 --> 13:02.515
that certain breast cancers are inherited.
No one else believes this. We do.

13:02.516 --> 13:05.717
To prove it, we have to
do four things. Sarah? First?

13:05.718 --> 13:08.563
Find a group of women
who have breast cancer,

13:08.564 --> 13:11.409
and from within that group,
women who have relatives...

13:11.410 --> 13:14.293
- who have breast cancer.
- Second?

13:14.294 --> 13:20.375
We then need to find a way to track the
inheritance of our breast cancer gene...

13:20.376 --> 13:24.236
- from generation to generation.
- Third?

13:24.538 --> 13:30.409
Even if we manage to map the
gene to a specific chromosome,

13:30.410 --> 13:34.269
we then need to isolate and
sequence it to find the mutation,

13:34.270 --> 13:38.117
which will take years.
And then, uh...

13:38.118 --> 13:40.885
then we find out if it repeats in
the relatives. And if it does,

13:40.886 --> 13:44.015
- then that is our link.
- Fourth?

13:44.024 --> 13:47.726
Fourth and, realistically,
maybe the most difficult.

13:47.728 --> 13:52.631
We then need to figure out why
a mutation in a single gene...

13:52.632 --> 13:54.700
could lead to breast
cancer in so many women.

13:54.701 --> 13:58.303
Wonderful. See you first thing.

14:17.490 --> 14:20.359
- Hey.
- Why are you playing in the van?

14:20.360 --> 14:23.686
- The acoustics in here are incredible.
- Slow day, then?

14:23.687 --> 14:29.369
Strange as it may seem, no one wants
their pool service this time of year.

14:30.771 --> 14:34.540
And look at me. I'm a
Canadian pool man.

14:34.541 --> 14:38.778
I'm like one of those...
those oxy... oxy...

14:38.779 --> 14:42.081
- Morons.
- Morons.

14:42.082 --> 14:44.116
Yes.

14:44.117 --> 14:46.218
I'm gonna go inside.

14:46.820 --> 14:48.821
Oh.

14:48.822 --> 14:51.157
Okay. Well...

14:52.259 --> 14:57.595
I was kind of thinking maybe you
should hang out here for a bit.

15:00.066 --> 15:01.734
<i>Sha-la-la-la-la</i>

15:01.735 --> 15:03.736
<i>Live for today</i>

15:03.737 --> 15:06.071
<i>Sha-la-la-la-la</i>

15:06.072 --> 15:08.707
<i>Live for today...</i>

15:08.708 --> 15:14.145
<i>Yeah, yeah. I know. But we were young,
and we had lots of time on our hands.</i>

15:14.447 --> 15:17.182
<i>Thumpity thumpity thump.</i>

15:22.822 --> 15:24.923
Gee.

15:35.501 --> 15:37.902
Paul?

15:42.775 --> 15:45.143
Paul?

15:45.545 --> 15:47.746
What are you doing?

15:47.747 --> 15:51.215
Nothing. Just, you know, practicing.

15:52.151 --> 15:56.154
- You okay?
- Yeah.

16:07.166 --> 16:08.467
Paul!

16:08.468 --> 16:12.004
- Paul!
- What?

16:12.005 --> 16:14.573
- Joanie!
- Oh!

16:14.574 --> 16:15.875
- Joanie!
- What's going on?

16:15.876 --> 16:17.276
- She's pregnant.
- Paul.

16:17.277 --> 16:20.869
- No, I mean, you know...
- Oh, my God! Honey!

16:20.870 --> 16:22.146
You're gonna be a new mommy.

16:22.147 --> 16:24.483
- Okay.
- Shit!

16:25.085 --> 16:29.088
He's... He's good-looking.

16:29.089 --> 16:32.591
For a baby, you know.
In an ugly kind of way.

16:32.592 --> 16:37.194
He's got bass player hands.

16:38.163 --> 16:41.734
I mean, I'm not saying that,
you know, babies are ugly.

16:41.735 --> 16:46.871
They just got that kind
of ugly baby thing going.

16:59.885 --> 17:03.422
<i>You need to borrow</i>

17:03.423 --> 17:05.290
<i>Like the platforms</i>

17:05.291 --> 17:09.461
<i>For no one can fill</i>

17:09.462 --> 17:11.763
<i>All of those needs</i>

17:11.765 --> 17:15.200
<i>That you won't let show</i>

17:15.201 --> 17:18.971
- <i>You just call on me, sister</i>
- Hey.

17:18.972 --> 17:22.606
- <i>When you need a hand</i>
- Joanie. Hey.

17:25.010 --> 17:29.515
After you had your
baby, did you, like...

17:30.417 --> 17:33.018
do it less?

17:33.019 --> 17:35.554
Honey, have you and Paul been...

17:35.555 --> 17:39.357
It's really bad.
We're down to, like...

17:40.759 --> 17:43.395
four times a week now.

17:47.800 --> 17:50.301
Are you serious?

17:50.403 --> 17:54.239
- That's actually quite a lot, Annie.
- It is?

17:54.240 --> 17:56.374
Yeah.

17:58.510 --> 18:01.813
- Sorry.
- Don't you dare!

18:04.817 --> 18:07.085
No. No.

18:13.058 --> 18:15.427
- Joanie, what's wrong?
- Are you okay?

18:15.428 --> 18:20.032
- You all right?
- I'm sorry. It's just I... Excuse me.

18:20.934 --> 18:23.101
Joan?

18:25.637 --> 18:27.072
I'm sorry. Did I hurt you?

18:27.073 --> 18:30.175
Oh, come on, Annie.
I make you cry, remember?

18:30.176 --> 18:32.678
What is it?

18:34.080 --> 18:35.814
Um...

18:36.716 --> 18:39.218
Well, it might not be
as bad as it sounds.

18:39.219 --> 18:41.253
Joan?

18:41.254 --> 18:45.791
I found a lump... in my breast.

18:47.193 --> 18:49.862
But you're gonna be
all right. Okay? Yeah?

18:49.863 --> 18:51.263
You're gonna be just fine.

18:51.264 --> 18:52.798
- Snap.
- Snap.

18:52.799 --> 18:55.833
- I'm gonna be fine.
- Yeah. Yeah.

18:57.536 --> 19:01.673
- I love you.
- I love you, honey.

19:01.674 --> 19:04.476
- My big sister.
- That's right.

19:05.378 --> 19:08.046
Four times a week.

19:08.548 --> 19:09.882
Really?

19:09.883 --> 19:13.052
Do you remember the man
in the room upstairs?

19:13.053 --> 19:16.688
- It wasn't a man, it was death.
- Shh!

19:16.689 --> 19:20.926
What, you think if we don't
say it, it'll go away?

19:20.927 --> 19:23.395
Okay, I'll whisper.

19:24.497 --> 19:27.098
Did you ever go in there?

19:31.704 --> 19:34.106
Just once.

19:34.808 --> 19:37.308
Right before...

19:40.512 --> 19:43.382
No. I never did.

19:43.383 --> 19:47.352
Joanie! It's not funny.
It's so not funny.

19:47.353 --> 19:49.989
- I can't stop thinking about it.
- Death?

19:49.990 --> 19:53.224
Shh! Yeah.

19:53.326 --> 19:56.428
- And...
- Cancer?

19:56.429 --> 19:58.596
Yeah.

19:58.798 --> 20:01.266
It's stalking us.

20:01.568 --> 20:04.969
Oh, you mean like that guy you
met at the Leafs game who kept...

20:04.970 --> 20:08.574
calling you and sending
you chocolate hearts,

20:08.575 --> 20:11.376
and then he parked
outside our house, and...

20:11.377 --> 20:15.580
Dad caught him jerking
off into <i> Hockey News?</i>

20:19.218 --> 20:21.519
Yeah.

20:21.621 --> 20:23.689
Like him.

20:23.690 --> 20:25.991
Because I'm scared.

20:25.992 --> 20:29.928
I'm really, really scared
that it's inside of us,

20:29.929 --> 20:32.397
it's in our family.

20:33.099 --> 20:35.701
Sweetie...

20:35.702 --> 20:38.169
that's not true.

20:43.775 --> 20:47.712
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

20:48.014 --> 20:52.583
Don't be. I like it
when you're worried.

20:54.353 --> 20:58.589
I like it when you
have lots of problems.

21:21.313 --> 21:24.282
It's gonna be really
hard without Joanie.

21:26.051 --> 21:28.186
I know.

21:28.588 --> 21:31.023
- I know.
- Come here.

21:31.024 --> 21:34.193
Come here. Come here.

21:34.194 --> 21:39.264
Well, at least she went quick.
Not like my wife.

21:39.265 --> 21:44.102
Boy, she took her time, didn't she?
I mean, it was endless suffering.

21:44.103 --> 21:46.237
Endless.

21:49.575 --> 21:51.977
My God.

21:51.978 --> 21:54.780
First your mother,

21:54.781 --> 21:57.649
then your father.

21:57.650 --> 22:01.685
Now... poor Joan.

22:13.665 --> 22:17.502
You again? Cool.

22:17.503 --> 22:21.039
You know, a lot of women can't be hot

22:21.040 --> 22:23.175
and in mourning at the same time,

22:23.176 --> 22:26.844
but you... you pull it off.

22:29.381 --> 22:34.752
I don't mean any disrespect,
but when you think about it,

22:35.054 --> 22:38.710
isn't sex our way of saying

22:38.711 --> 22:42.350
"fuck you" to death?

22:44.330 --> 22:47.965
How are you still working here?

22:55.574 --> 22:59.278
<i>The thing was, I started thinking
about it all the time...</i>

22:59.279 --> 23:01.612
<i>my family and death.</i>

23:01.714 --> 23:04.116
<i>Watching me, waiting,</i>

23:04.117 --> 23:08.954
<i>hiding in a closet or parked outside
the house, the</i> Hockey News.

23:10.256 --> 23:13.423
Oh, you might feel some discomfort.

23:15.194 --> 23:17.262
Beautiful day today.

23:17.263 --> 23:20.932
Though I'm stuck in here,
it looked lovely through the window.

23:20.933 --> 23:26.637
And I spoke to your husband.
He explained you were very worried.

23:27.573 --> 23:30.242
He said I was feeling
myself up, right?

23:30.243 --> 23:35.012
Checking, yes. Perfectly
understandable once in a while.

23:36.148 --> 23:38.615
He said once in a while?

24:19.491 --> 24:21.460
Yeah.

24:21.461 --> 24:25.696
Oh, yeah. Keep talking.
Oh, keep talking.

24:30.001 --> 24:34.139
You know, there is a simple check
you can do for testicular cancer.

24:34.140 --> 24:36.274
I heard about this.

24:36.275 --> 24:40.412
Baby, do you want me to check
you now while I'm down there?

24:40.413 --> 24:42.381
- Come on.
- Annie. Annie.

24:42.382 --> 24:45.150
What? Oh, what?

24:45.151 --> 24:50.655
He mentioned that perhaps
you were overly concerned.

24:51.557 --> 24:55.727
I know your family history.
It's very sad.

24:55.728 --> 24:59.965
But that doesn't mean that
you're going to get cancer.

24:59.966 --> 25:05.204
Look, Anne. White coat,
stethoscope. You can trust me.

25:05.205 --> 25:07.339
No more worrying, okay?

25:07.340 --> 25:11.075
- Okay.
- Good. That's my girl.

25:17.549 --> 25:20.852
I don't know about genetics.
I know about computers.

25:20.853 --> 25:24.489
You see, I make these cards, and then I
load them into the front of the computer,

25:24.490 --> 25:27.626
along with everyone else's, and then,
usually the next day sometime,

25:27.627 --> 25:30.128
depending on how many other
people are using the computer,

25:30.129 --> 25:35.333
maybe a few days later, I get
this printout. And there you go.

25:35.334 --> 25:37.936
And for the amount of data
we're going to have, how fast?

25:37.937 --> 25:42.234
The university's mainframe computer weighs
2 1/2 tons. It's capable of storing...

25:42.235 --> 25:45.911
- 700 kilobytes of data.
- I'm sorry. How long?

25:46.813 --> 25:51.350
Once we get the data, make
a program and then load it...

25:52.552 --> 25:54.919
Ten years?

26:00.392 --> 26:02.093
Will?

26:02.094 --> 26:04.463
- Yeah?
- Honey.

26:04.464 --> 26:07.032
Come on. Get up.

26:07.033 --> 26:09.901
- I'm up.
- No, no, no.

26:09.902 --> 26:12.938
If you're not out of
bed, you're not up.

26:12.939 --> 26:14.973
Hey.

26:15.875 --> 26:19.511
- You're not gonna have breakfast?
- Uh... No, I can't.

26:19.512 --> 26:22.613
Work. Got a new client.

26:23.815 --> 26:26.351
They called this morning.

26:26.352 --> 26:30.253
- Kiss?
- I'm already late, Annie.

26:32.491 --> 26:37.962
What? Hey, I'm a musician,
okay? It's a look.

26:39.564 --> 26:41.632
Okay.

26:46.371 --> 26:50.375
When I grow up, I'm gonna
be a pool man, like Dad.

26:50.376 --> 26:54.846
Do you, sweetie? Oh, that's so nice.

26:54.847 --> 26:58.916
Well, maybe when you're a little
older, we'll talk about it, okay?

27:01.019 --> 27:03.621
Mommy's gonna go take a shower.

27:43.094 --> 27:46.830
Mommy loves you, okay?
Have a great day.

28:02.014 --> 28:04.615
All right.

28:04.917 --> 28:07.084
Anne...

28:09.020 --> 28:14.524
your biopsy shows that you have
carcinoma of the left breast.

28:15.360 --> 28:18.663
Phew. And I thought it was
gonna be really bad news.

28:18.664 --> 28:22.300
Well, it's quite
advanced, I'm afraid.

28:22.301 --> 28:26.204
But what I recommend
would be surgery.

28:26.205 --> 28:27.906
- Surgery?
- Mm-hmm.

28:27.907 --> 28:32.377
What's known as a modified
radical mastectomy.

28:33.079 --> 28:36.448
- Oh, God.
- I'm sorry, Anne.

28:36.449 --> 28:42.085
The surgery would require, I'm afraid,
the removal of the entire breast,

28:42.086 --> 28:46.390
as well as most of your
underarm lymph nodes.

28:46.692 --> 28:51.628
Oh, God. Oh, God. William.

28:53.331 --> 28:56.835
I'm scared. I'm really scared.

28:57.937 --> 28:59.604
I don't want to suffer.

28:59.605 --> 29:01.640
- I know. I know.
- I don't want to suffer.

29:01.641 --> 29:04.509
I don't want to die.

29:05.211 --> 29:07.746
Oh, God.

29:08.648 --> 29:10.682
Oh, God.

29:11.584 --> 29:13.684
Oh, God.

29:33.805 --> 29:35.507
Hey.

29:35.508 --> 29:37.775
Hey.

29:43.081 --> 29:45.716
How you doing?

29:47.118 --> 29:50.621
Hey, you want an ice chip?

29:59.531 --> 30:01.565
Oh.

30:06.705 --> 30:09.406
Can I have one?

30:10.675 --> 30:15.347
This is really good ice. Oh, my God.

30:17.249 --> 30:21.219
Oh, my God. Wow. It's really good.

30:21.821 --> 30:25.123
Ow. It hurts. Don't make me laugh.

30:25.124 --> 30:28.525
What? Oh, don't... Oh.

30:36.301 --> 30:39.002
It really hurts.

31:20.044 --> 31:23.448
- And how are we feeling today?
- Not too good.

31:23.449 --> 31:26.983
- Oh?
- I had a breast removed.

31:27.786 --> 31:32.257
- Of course. What I meant...
- I'm feeling all right, considering.

31:32.258 --> 31:34.692
Good.

31:35.094 --> 31:38.730
But, you know, I just knew
this was gonna happen.

31:38.731 --> 31:43.101
It happened to my mom, happened to my
sister, and it happened to my grandma...

31:43.102 --> 31:48.340
Many women feel that way and, yes,
your family did have a bit of bad luck,

31:48.341 --> 31:50.786
- but there are many complex factors...
- It's not bad luck.

31:50.787 --> 31:55.413
There's some evidence that certain
people have a predisposition

31:55.414 --> 31:59.918
- based on diet or environmental factors...
- Excuse me a minute.

32:01.920 --> 32:03.922
What are you doing?

32:03.923 --> 32:06.457
Well, there's just some interesting
current research that suggests...

32:06.458 --> 32:11.062
Look, rejection of orthodoxy always seems
within the purview of the young doctor.

32:11.063 --> 32:12.530
I don't know what my age
has to do with that.

32:12.531 --> 32:15.800
However, to mislead is irresponsible.

32:15.801 --> 32:18.636
There have always been articles.
There always will be articles.

32:18.637 --> 32:22.607
But because some theory is new doesn't
make it right. Proof makes it right.

32:22.608 --> 32:26.845
And I've seen no recent evidence concerning
alternative treatment for cancer

32:26.846 --> 32:29.314
which would lead me to alter
the views I've acquired

32:29.315 --> 32:32.616
over 40 years of practicing medicine.

32:33.618 --> 32:36.553
- I understand.
- Good.

32:39.057 --> 32:41.191
Good.

32:45.363 --> 32:49.534
Hey, if you wanna talk some more,
you can just give me a call.

32:49.535 --> 32:52.737
- Oh, thanks a lot, Dr....
- Doctor!

32:53.439 --> 32:55.773
Sean is fine.

32:55.774 --> 32:58.109
- Anne, right?
- Annie.

32:58.110 --> 33:00.044
Annie.

33:00.045 --> 33:02.146
Thanks.

33:02.748 --> 33:07.118
Let me tell you, I'm gonna be the
best nurse you have ever had.

33:07.119 --> 33:11.922
And I think I already am, because you
can't make out with your other nurses.

34:11.248 --> 34:15.717
Mommy was in the hospital
because Mommy has cancer.

34:16.754 --> 34:20.891
- Didn't Aunt Joan have cancer?
- Yeah, she did, sweetie.

34:20.893 --> 34:23.527
But she died.

34:23.529 --> 34:25.596
Yeah, she did.

34:25.597 --> 34:29.067
- Are you gonna die?
- Hey, no.

34:29.068 --> 34:31.302
I promise you.

34:31.303 --> 34:35.005
You are not gonna lose
your mommy to cancer.

34:35.007 --> 34:37.408
But how do you know?

34:37.409 --> 34:42.012
Because I just know.
I'm not gonna die.

35:14.379 --> 35:16.381
Wait.

35:16.382 --> 35:19.249
I wanna come with you.

35:20.451 --> 35:24.187
- I'm not going anywhere.
- You're going to work.

35:24.756 --> 35:26.457
That's not anywhere.

35:26.458 --> 35:29.227
Aren't you cleaning Louise
and Steve's pool today?

35:29.228 --> 35:33.597
I wanna come with you.
Come on. It'll be fun.

35:34.299 --> 35:36.533
Please?

35:39.237 --> 35:41.705
Come on, then.

35:45.777 --> 35:48.747
- Let's get in.
- Yeah, right.

35:48.748 --> 35:50.215
I'm serious.

35:50.216 --> 35:53.885
- Uh, we're not getting in.
- Why not?

35:53.886 --> 35:56.320
Because I don't want to,

35:56.321 --> 36:01.359
and because I'm a pool man, and pool
men don't get into people's pools.

36:01.360 --> 36:05.528
Is that, like, the pool man's
code of ethics or something?

36:09.467 --> 36:11.535
Why is the water green?

36:11.536 --> 36:16.107
Because Louise's dumbfuck husband
only has me come once a month.

36:16.108 --> 36:19.510
No. No, I mean, really,
why is it green?

36:19.511 --> 36:24.215
Oh, that's... that's algae. It's there
because the pH balance of the pool is off.

36:24.216 --> 36:28.719
It can't be too acid or too base.
It needs to be around 7.5,

36:28.720 --> 36:32.224
the same pH as human tears.

36:32.225 --> 36:34.358
Aw.

36:34.460 --> 36:36.527
See, if you, uh...

36:36.528 --> 36:40.298
If you don't put chlorine in,
you get phosphates,

36:40.299 --> 36:43.000
and algae feeds on phosphate.

36:43.001 --> 36:47.405
But if you put chlorine in,
the algae will die.

36:47.406 --> 36:52.742
But you can't be a dumbfuck and only
have your pool man come once a month.

36:54.379 --> 36:57.248
Are you gonna keep
wearing eye makeup?

36:57.249 --> 37:00.316
Yeah, I am.

37:03.321 --> 37:05.527
I'm gonna get something to drink.
You want something?

37:05.528 --> 37:09.217
Nah. I'll stay here.

37:12.163 --> 37:15.433
<i>I didn't know if the pool was green
because Paul was a bad pool man</i>

37:15.434 --> 37:19.936
<i>or because Louise's husband was
a dumbfuck. But it made me think.</i>

37:25.576 --> 37:28.947
"Breast cancer. See cancer."

37:28.948 --> 37:30.748
Okay.

37:30.749 --> 37:33.751
"Cancer. Any malignant
growth or tumor

37:33.752 --> 37:39.022
caused by abnormal
uncontrolled cell divisions."

37:42.894 --> 37:45.595
William?

37:45.697 --> 37:49.900
- Willy, Mommy needs the bathroom.
- Number one or number two?

37:50.102 --> 37:52.303
Number one or number two?

38:14.458 --> 38:18.997
Mommy's gonna buy you
a new backpack. Okay?

38:23.467 --> 38:25.937
Hi. Sorry. I'm, uh...

38:25.938 --> 38:29.207
- Where are you off to?
- Detroit.

38:29.208 --> 38:33.478
- Gotta run. Hope you're well.
- I am fine. What about our coffee?

38:34.780 --> 38:37.147
You're late.

38:39.050 --> 38:41.485
- What's going on?
- Allen, you got here too late.

38:41.486 --> 38:43.988
- You're late.
- I know, I know. I'm late, I'm late.

38:43.989 --> 38:47.592
We have news. We've identified
a dozen high-risk families...

38:47.593 --> 38:49.494
50-some cancer cases between them.

38:49.495 --> 38:51.596
- Good. And so?
- So?

38:51.597 --> 38:54.332
So now we can begin to look
for correlations in earnest.

38:54.333 --> 38:56.434
We need to interview them,
get blood samples,

38:56.435 --> 38:58.736
extract the DNA, and then
begin to look for markers.

38:58.737 --> 39:01.339
- Okay. "Markers"?
- Genetic markers.

39:01.340 --> 39:05.509
We can track them through the families,
like a signpost on a highway.

39:05.510 --> 39:07.611
Say you have two stretches
of road in the desert...

39:07.612 --> 39:09.863
- And they look exactly the same.
- But if you pass signposts,

39:09.864 --> 39:11.065
you can measure the intervals...

39:11.066 --> 39:12.950
And you can identify the
different stretches of road.

39:12.951 --> 39:14.986
- Even if they look...
- And if those markers

39:14.987 --> 39:19.256
are next to something like the breast
cancer gene, it can be identified.

39:37.975 --> 39:43.046
What is it with the magazine
selection in doctors' offices?

39:43.248 --> 39:45.615
Hello.

39:45.717 --> 39:48.519
<i>Field & Stream?</i>

39:49.221 --> 39:53.957
Do a lot of your patients show
up wearing camouflage bibs,

39:54.359 --> 39:58.296
a bag full of decoys,
and making duck calls?

39:58.297 --> 40:01.064
I don't know, ma'am.

40:01.166 --> 40:04.836
I would think that you would
notice something like that.

40:04.837 --> 40:08.171
Like I said, I don't know.

40:11.375 --> 40:13.977
Quack.

40:16.514 --> 40:18.749
Quack.

40:19.651 --> 40:22.153
Quack.

40:22.154 --> 40:23.788
Quack quack.

40:23.789 --> 40:25.556
Quack.

40:25.557 --> 40:27.724
Quack.

40:29.760 --> 40:31.695
Nice office.

40:32.597 --> 40:37.234
It's not mine. Dr. Benton takes long
lunches. I figure it's not hurting anybody.

40:37.235 --> 40:42.173
It was either here or the cafeteria,
and the floors are much stickier there.

40:42.174 --> 40:44.175
Are you sure you won't
get into any trouble?

40:44.176 --> 40:46.776
I'm a doctor. I can't get in trouble.

40:50.214 --> 40:52.950
What can I tell you?
I'm mostly lab-based,

40:52.951 --> 40:56.921
but I can tell you what I know.

40:57.823 --> 41:00.256
Why do I have cancer?

41:02.093 --> 41:04.161
That's a big question.

41:04.162 --> 41:07.965
There's no one answer.
So many factors involved.

41:07.966 --> 41:11.267
I had a feeling that
you might say that.

41:12.536 --> 41:15.005
You know, I had a teacher
once who told me

41:15.006 --> 41:17.341
what the ideal breast
cancer patient would be.

41:17.342 --> 41:21.746
He said the person with the highest risk
would be a nun living in a cold climate,

41:21.747 --> 41:25.116
who was overweight, who ate
red meat, who was breast fed,

41:25.117 --> 41:27.552
whose mother and sister had
premenopausal breast cancer,

41:27.553 --> 41:30.520
and who was Ashkenazi Jewish.

41:36.127 --> 41:37.628
<i>Not a great start,</i>

41:37.629 --> 41:41.798
<i>but he gave me a pile of books,
and I promised to read them.</i>

41:56.213 --> 41:58.849
Doesn't make any sense.

42:08.826 --> 42:11.562
Oh, shit!

42:12.464 --> 42:14.165
Good, good! Ohh!

42:14.166 --> 42:15.833
<i>...the puck has cleared it behind...</i>

42:15.834 --> 42:18.836
You know, it's been hard for
him, too, with everything.

42:18.837 --> 42:22.440
It's not like he gets...

42:22.441 --> 42:25.176
any attention.

42:25.177 --> 42:27.244
You're right, you know?
I'm being selfish.

42:27.245 --> 42:30.180
No. That's not what I meant.

42:31.082 --> 42:35.486
You're right. Maybe I am.

42:36.388 --> 42:40.725
You know, I feel sorry
for Paul. I do, and I...

42:42.127 --> 42:45.094
I feel sorry for me, too, but...

42:47.798 --> 42:50.300
You know what I feel most of all?

42:52.270 --> 42:54.337
What?

42:56.574 --> 42:59.409
I just wanna be touched.

43:02.079 --> 43:05.615
- Come here.
- Come on.

43:08.285 --> 43:11.220
Come here. Come here.

43:21.632 --> 43:24.268
Okay.

43:24.269 --> 43:26.803
So this is something
we need to look at.

43:29.974 --> 43:32.308
Don't mind me.

43:34.144 --> 43:37.948
So does that mean I have to eat
nothing but grapefruit or something?

43:37.949 --> 43:39.617
No, no. It's nothing that severe.

43:39.618 --> 43:43.187
Although studies have shown that
foods high in fat, fried foods...

43:43.188 --> 43:47.091
- Japanese women.
- Pardon me?

43:47.092 --> 43:50.294
They eat very little red meat,
and they have a much lower rate

43:50.295 --> 43:52.162
of breast cancer than
North American women.

43:52.163 --> 43:54.765
Is that so?

43:55.467 --> 43:57.335
Yeah.

43:59.437 --> 44:01.572
- So did your family go out...
- Three different tests.

44:01.573 --> 44:05.542
One was over ten years.
It's fairly conclusive.

44:08.913 --> 44:11.714
Anyway, I'm gonna get going.

44:17.354 --> 44:20.090
- So...
- We can't know anything.

44:20.091 --> 44:22.126
There's so many possible factors.

44:22.127 --> 44:25.529
It could be diet. It could
be toxins in the home.

44:25.530 --> 44:28.965
One of a thousand viruses
known or unknown.

44:29.267 --> 44:31.602
They know the groups that
have the highest incidents.

44:31.603 --> 44:34.772
They don't know the elements
common to those groups.

44:34.773 --> 44:38.510
We don't know what happened to
your family. We may never know.

44:40.412 --> 44:45.382
My mom used to wrap hot dogs in
bacon, and they deep-fried them.

44:49.453 --> 44:52.723
- What's this?
- It's dinner.

44:52.724 --> 44:55.325
Where's the rest of it?

44:55.527 --> 44:58.928
That's it. It's a salad.

45:01.398 --> 45:04.768
It's got tomatoes in it.
I hate tomatoes.

45:05.270 --> 45:07.871
You can pick them out.

45:11.241 --> 45:14.410
Is everything okay?

45:15.512 --> 45:18.180
Yeah. Yeah.

45:23.120 --> 45:28.290
You know what? Um, I'm gonna
go get us some burgers.

45:29.259 --> 45:30.604
You want one?

45:30.605 --> 45:33.797
Yeah! But no tomatoes
and no oniony things.

45:33.798 --> 45:37.726
No tomatoes and no
oniony things. Okay.

45:37.927 --> 45:40.360
You want one?

45:48.912 --> 45:50.781
Why are we looking
at Mormons and Jews?

45:50.782 --> 45:53.017
Mormons tend to have
very large families,

45:53.018 --> 45:55.653
which makes them excellent
genetic resources.

45:55.654 --> 45:57.421
Plus the Church of Latter Day Saints

45:57.422 --> 46:02.126
believes everyone related to the Mormons
has to be baptized to be saved later.

46:02.127 --> 46:05.262
So, what, there's carcinogens in
the baptismal water they're using?

46:05.263 --> 46:09.867
No. But they keep incredibly detailed
records of their familial ties.

46:09.868 --> 46:15.372
A researcher before us found 30
cases of breast cancer in one family.

46:15.373 --> 46:16.940
Called the Kindred 107.

46:16.941 --> 46:18.976
Ashkenazi Jews are
important, Tom, because

46:18.977 --> 46:21.645
they have an extraordinarily
high rate of breast cancer.

46:21.646 --> 46:25.416
- In New York, it's an epidemic.
- Okay. But...

46:25.417 --> 46:27.317
why couldn't it be the
water or the air?

46:27.318 --> 46:29.887
If that was true, it would be
true of all women in the area.

46:29.888 --> 46:32.189
Breathing the same air,
drinking the same water.

46:32.190 --> 46:34.691
- But it's not.
- So it's something in them.

46:34.692 --> 46:37.093
In their genes.

46:51.842 --> 46:54.611
You're early. Dr. Gold's not here.

46:55.313 --> 46:57.848
So how did you know all
that stuff the other day?

46:57.849 --> 47:01.584
- What stuff?
- The medical stuff.

47:03.954 --> 47:07.565
- I used to be a nurse.
- You used to be a nurse?

47:07.566 --> 47:09.649
- Yep.
- What happened?

47:09.650 --> 47:14.365
What do you mean, "what happened"?
You don't think I enjoy this? Yes?

47:14.366 --> 47:15.966
Okay.

47:15.967 --> 47:19.770
Mr. Elson, you can take your wife
through to the back with the nurse.

47:20.972 --> 47:24.141
Seriously, what happened?

47:25.043 --> 47:26.877
Uh...

47:27.779 --> 47:31.381
I used to work in the oncology ward.

47:31.382 --> 47:35.586
But it was too much, so I quit.

47:36.488 --> 47:40.322
You're right. Cancer patients
are a pain in the ass.

47:42.259 --> 47:44.228
- Sorry.
- Hello.

47:44.229 --> 47:47.498
Yes, Doctor, the tests will
be ready this afternoon.

47:47.499 --> 47:51.301
No, Doctor. I would've told you.
Okay. Bye-bye.

47:52.003 --> 47:55.105
- You're right.
- About what?

47:55.106 --> 47:57.641
You're all a pain in the ass.

47:58.143 --> 48:00.310
That's true.

48:01.212 --> 48:03.914
- He likes you, you know.
- Who?

48:03.915 --> 48:06.049
Dr. Gold?

48:06.050 --> 48:07.918
Yeah, him.

48:07.919 --> 48:10.921
- No.
- Yes, he does.

48:10.922 --> 48:15.492
- I'm married.
- Of course. What was I thinking?

48:15.994 --> 48:19.763
- Annie.
- Hey. Hi.

48:20.465 --> 48:23.232
Oh. Oh.

48:49.459 --> 48:52.963
I could've gotten cancer from
my mom? Like passed down?

48:52.964 --> 48:56.900
Uh, there's no evidence that
you can get it passed down.

48:56.901 --> 49:00.671
All cancer is genetic in the end, just
not necessarily in the beginning.

49:00.672 --> 49:02.472
I don't understand.

49:02.473 --> 49:06.310
When you get cancer,
your DNA gets messed up,

49:06.311 --> 49:11.515
and certain genes can cause
your cells to replicate wildly.

49:11.516 --> 49:15.553
But something has to mess the
DNA up in the first place, right?

49:15.554 --> 49:20.189
- Right.
- Well, then, what messes it up?

49:20.291 --> 49:23.126
We don't know, really.

49:25.562 --> 49:29.232
I really didn't mean
to upset you again.

49:29.334 --> 49:32.469
It's not you. It's me.

49:32.470 --> 49:35.438
It's the chemo, I think. You know...

49:35.439 --> 49:39.710
I even cried at the Leafs
game with Paul last night.

49:39.711 --> 49:41.512
- You did?
- Yeah.

49:41.513 --> 49:46.482
It was a tie, but the
players all looked so sad.

49:55.325 --> 49:57.560
Hey, An...

50:03.567 --> 50:05.535
Hey, hon.

50:07.805 --> 50:09.605
Hon.

50:11.942 --> 50:14.144
Annie...

50:14.746 --> 50:16.813
Why?

50:16.814 --> 50:20.450
Why? We've got doctors.

50:20.451 --> 50:22.586
The chemo...

50:22.587 --> 50:25.322
is going well...

50:26.024 --> 50:28.390
you know?

50:30.394 --> 50:34.363
I've gotta do something. I...

50:34.465 --> 50:36.600
Annie...

50:37.502 --> 50:41.370
Hey, why can't you
just leave it alone?

50:45.242 --> 50:47.678
<i>I really didn't know.</i>

50:47.679 --> 50:51.281
<i>I think that part more than
anything drove him crazy.</i>

50:51.282 --> 50:56.018
<i>Guys want reasons.
I should've made one up.</i>

51:34.658 --> 51:38.328
I don't know, Annie. Maybe
you need to give him time.

51:38.329 --> 51:40.797
I've given him time.

51:41.699 --> 51:44.201
Maybe it has something
to do with the...

51:44.202 --> 51:46.636
- You know. The...
- What?

51:46.637 --> 51:50.641
I don't know. All the research.
It's a tiny, tiny bit obsessive.

51:51.743 --> 51:54.912
Obsessive? How?

51:54.913 --> 51:57.447
You know, like...

51:57.749 --> 52:00.115
wacko obsessive.

52:03.053 --> 52:07.790
Wacko obsessive.
It's not the bad kind, then.

52:10.260 --> 52:14.649
It's not too late to reach out
to him and to let him know...

52:14.650 --> 52:16.990
how you feel.

52:19.069 --> 52:21.370
What, like a blow job?

52:24.141 --> 52:26.576
Yeah, that's exactly what I mean.

52:27.078 --> 52:29.579
Have you guys heard
of Mary-Claire King?

52:29.580 --> 52:33.083
She used dental genetics
to identify children

52:33.084 --> 52:36.186
of parents murdered by
the junta in Argentina.

52:36.187 --> 52:42.191
But she is also doing some very interesting
work on the genetics of breast cancer.

52:43.727 --> 52:47.931
<i>So I wrote to Dr. King,
and I wrote to her again,</i>

52:47.932 --> 52:50.534
<i>and I wrote a third
and a fourth time.</i>

52:50.535 --> 52:55.137
<i>I told her my story,
my family's story.</i>

53:08.285 --> 53:13.457
<i>Books were hard for me, so I started
making models so I could understand.</i>

53:13.458 --> 53:18.627
<i>Cells, genes,
chromosomes, and a helix.</i>

53:22.232 --> 53:24.767
I'm going to the bar!

53:26.536 --> 53:28.505
What?

53:28.506 --> 53:33.409
I'm going to the effing bar because
this is an effing building site!

53:34.344 --> 53:36.846
I can't hear you!

53:37.748 --> 53:40.783
I don't fucking believe this.

53:40.785 --> 53:43.452
I'm going out!

53:43.754 --> 53:47.056
Hey, watch the rest of the game.
Remember the score.

53:47.658 --> 53:51.660
Paul, would you put William to bed?

54:19.022 --> 54:22.025
<i>We didn't discover much
in that first year,</i>

54:22.026 --> 54:26.061
<i>but, oddly, that
mattered less and less.</i>

54:27.731 --> 54:30.934
<i>Something mysterious
was taking hold of me.</i>

54:30.935 --> 54:35.337
<i>I didn't know what it was then.
That would come later.</i>

54:40.143 --> 54:41.912
<i>And then, some news.</i>

54:41.913 --> 54:46.149
Keep having you in to do
screenings every six months or so

54:46.150 --> 54:47.884
just as a precautionary measure,

54:47.885 --> 54:52.255
but I would say that
cancer is out of your life.

54:52.256 --> 54:55.558
You have reason to celebrate.

54:55.860 --> 54:57.960
Done?

54:58.662 --> 55:00.630
I'm done with chemo?

55:00.631 --> 55:03.433
You're done with chemo.

55:45.142 --> 55:46.810
Hey.

55:46.811 --> 55:50.180
Hey. What is this?

55:50.181 --> 55:54.350
Uh, Louise is watching William.

55:54.351 --> 55:57.920
Okay. Um, I...

55:58.022 --> 56:00.290
I wish you had told me.

56:00.291 --> 56:03.994
- Why?
- 'Cause I have plans.

56:03.995 --> 56:06.062
- You have plans?
- Yeah.

56:06.063 --> 56:11.066
- What plans?
- Just... You know, just plans.

56:14.271 --> 56:16.138
I...

56:19.643 --> 56:24.681
Can you just... stay and eat a
little bit before you go at least?

56:24.682 --> 56:27.182
Yeah. Yeah.

56:29.019 --> 56:30.687
Great.

56:30.688 --> 56:32.722
Okay.

56:37.294 --> 56:39.596
Can you change them?

56:39.597 --> 56:43.165
- What?
- Your plans.

56:43.567 --> 56:46.002
I kind of, uh...

56:46.003 --> 56:48.672
I made this dinner special
for us, you know?

56:48.673 --> 56:52.384
Thank you. I know you
went to... a lot of trouble,

56:52.385 --> 56:54.644
- and it looks great. I just...
- No, no.

56:54.645 --> 56:58.680
There's no trouble, Paul, you know?

57:00.250 --> 57:05.521
We're married. Married people
do nice things for each other.

57:05.823 --> 57:07.656
I know.

57:07.758 --> 57:10.693
They do things together...

57:10.995 --> 57:14.095
like make love.

57:15.865 --> 57:18.401
Annie, please, just...

57:18.402 --> 57:20.670
We can have sex.

57:20.671 --> 57:22.672
Don't do this.

57:22.673 --> 57:25.574
Don't you love me anymore?

57:25.976 --> 57:29.446
Annie, I do. Hey, I want to.

57:29.447 --> 57:32.148
- You want to?
- No, I... I do.

57:32.149 --> 57:35.785
Well, then, I don't understand
what the problem is.

57:36.287 --> 57:39.155
Why can't you make
love to me anymore?

57:39.156 --> 57:40.857
Look, I just...
I just... I just can't.

57:40.858 --> 57:43.725
- You can't?
- Okay? I can't.

57:48.798 --> 57:51.701
Oh, is it because I
only have one breast?

57:51.702 --> 57:53.870
- Is that what it is?
- Oh, my God, Annie.

57:53.871 --> 57:58.308
Why don't you just, like, only put it up
halfway? Maybe you could get half-erect.

57:58.309 --> 58:00.977
- Maybe you could close one eye.
- Annie, stop it!

58:00.978 --> 58:05.415
- No, I will not stop it!
- Stop it! Stop! I can't touch you!

58:05.416 --> 58:08.884
Okay? I can't touch you!

58:09.186 --> 58:11.421
Annie...

58:11.422 --> 58:15.125
I can't even look at you,
at your body.

58:15.126 --> 58:17.460
I mean, I hate that...

58:17.461 --> 58:21.396
that hole, that scar.

58:23.133 --> 58:27.068
I'm sorry. I just...

58:36.946 --> 58:39.414
Paul...

59:27.063 --> 59:28.598
Knudson's two-hit theory?

59:28.599 --> 59:31.468
Normal cells have two
undamaged chromosomes...

59:31.469 --> 59:33.069
- ...one from the mom...
- And one from the dad.

59:33.070 --> 59:36.973
<i>Right. Now, let's say there is some sort
of hereditary predisposition to cancer.</i>

59:36.974 --> 59:40.975
<i>All that means is that one
of the genes is damaged.</i>

59:42.011 --> 59:44.681
<i>I still haven't heard from Dr. King.</i>

59:44.682 --> 59:48.051
<i>I don't think you're the only
person to write to her, Annie.</i>

59:48.052 --> 59:50.819
<i>In the last five years, the Broad
Institute, the Genome Institute...</i>

59:50.820 --> 59:54.923
<i>at Washington University,
and the Baylor College of Medicine...</i>

01:00:03.166 --> 01:00:06.469
<i>And I would go through life
with this one bad gene,</i>

01:00:06.470 --> 01:00:10.039
<i>and everything's still okay, because
the other gene is fine, right?</i>

01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:12.208
<i>And then one of these factors
comes along, like those...</i>

01:00:12.209 --> 01:00:15.678
<i>All that would mean is that they
would have to damage the other gene?</i>

01:00:15.679 --> 01:00:18.581
<i>Right. And then the cell is damaged
enough that it can mutate.</i>

01:00:18.582 --> 01:00:23.286
<i>- Which could be cancer.
- Could be. Can be. It's, uh...</i>

01:00:38.234 --> 01:00:40.936
It's all too much.

01:01:05.962 --> 01:01:08.997
Is this a doctorly hug?

01:01:14.003 --> 01:01:16.438
I should... I should leave.

01:01:18.274 --> 01:01:21.309
<i>He was a lovely man and a friend.</i>

01:01:21.479 --> 01:01:26.649
<i>But love is like DNA. We can't
know its predispositions.</i>

01:01:27.651 --> 01:01:31.654
<i>It wasn't to be. For me, anyway.</i>

01:01:52.809 --> 01:01:55.111
- Where's Dad?
- I don't know, sweetie.

01:01:55.112 --> 01:01:57.313
Maybe he went to work early.

01:01:57.314 --> 01:02:01.049
- Where's Dad?
- Come on. Eat your oatmeal.

01:02:16.466 --> 01:02:18.001
Not this. Please. Come on.

01:02:18.002 --> 01:02:20.336
I'm not gonna eat till you
tell me where Dad is.

01:02:20.337 --> 01:02:23.206
- Eat your oatmeal.
- Where's Dad?

01:02:23.207 --> 01:02:26.075
- Eat your oatmeal.
- I don't want to.

01:02:26.076 --> 01:02:29.311
I said eat your goddamn oatmeal now!

01:02:32.715 --> 01:02:37.486
Oh, God. William! Honey, I'm sorry.

01:02:45.862 --> 01:02:47.497
William!

01:02:52.502 --> 01:02:57.672
William, no. These are Mommy's things.
William, no. Please don't.

01:03:01.577 --> 01:03:04.814
Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry.

01:03:04.815 --> 01:03:06.849
Come here. Come here.

01:03:06.850 --> 01:03:10.019
Sweetie, come on. Come on.

01:03:10.020 --> 01:03:12.088
Come on.

01:03:12.089 --> 01:03:15.258
Hey, come on. I'm sorry.

01:03:15.259 --> 01:03:19.059
Hey, sweetie, come on. Come here.

01:03:23.099 --> 01:03:27.270
God, I'm sorry. I will never,
ever talk to you like that again.

01:03:27.271 --> 01:03:29.539
- Okay? I'm so sorry.
- I'm sorry.

01:03:29.540 --> 01:03:34.109
Hey, you don't need to be sorry.
They're Mommy's silly things.

01:03:42.885 --> 01:03:46.055
Louise? Louise!

01:03:46.056 --> 01:03:48.090
Sweetie?

01:03:50.927 --> 01:03:52.795
Louise?

01:03:57.900 --> 01:04:00.135
Stop!

01:04:03.106 --> 01:04:05.674
Oh, shit.

01:05:00.296 --> 01:05:02.665
- Divorced?
- Yes, sweetie.

01:05:02.666 --> 01:05:04.667
Mommy and Daddy are gonna
live in different houses,

01:05:04.668 --> 01:05:06.936
but that doesn't mean we don't
love you very, very much.

01:05:06.937 --> 01:05:09.172
This way, you'll have two houses.

01:05:09.173 --> 01:05:12.708
I don't want two houses. I want
us all together in one house.

01:05:12.709 --> 01:05:16.012
- So does Dad.
- Please, Paul, don't do that.

01:05:16.013 --> 01:05:17.914
What? I'm telling the truth.

01:05:17.915 --> 01:05:21.883
- I knew this was your fault.
- No, it's not my fault, honey. Paul?

01:05:21.884 --> 01:05:25.521
Maybe if you didn't spend all
your time on this DNA shit.

01:05:25.522 --> 01:05:30.082
- At least there's a reason for that.
- Reason? Really? What reason?

01:05:30.083 --> 01:05:32.236
- Tell me the reason.
- Because I have to know.

01:05:32.237 --> 01:05:34.289
- Are you fucking joking?
- Language.

01:05:34.290 --> 01:05:36.666
You have a high school
education, Annie.

01:05:36.667 --> 01:05:39.035
You don't know anything.
You're not gonna find out anything.

01:05:39.036 --> 01:05:41.637
- Is that why you won't touch me?
- Oh, here we go.

01:05:41.638 --> 01:05:46.842
Oh, so you can say... you can say that.
But I fucking can't say "fucking"?

01:05:47.244 --> 01:05:51.364
Do you wanna tell him the real
truth? Tell him about Louise?

01:05:51.690 --> 01:05:54.501
- Oh, my God.
- What about Aunt Louise?

01:05:54.502 --> 01:05:58.595
Nothing, William. It's nothing.

01:06:01.490 --> 01:06:03.826
Tell you what, Annie.

01:06:04.228 --> 01:06:07.794
I am sorry. I tried.

01:06:07.896 --> 01:06:11.934
- I tried. I just couldn't.
- Get out.

01:06:11.935 --> 01:06:14.702
- What?
- Get out.

01:06:20.142 --> 01:06:23.145
I'll tell you what, Annie.

01:06:23.247 --> 01:06:26.748
At least she was there for me.

01:06:39.896 --> 01:06:41.898
I'm so sorry.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.368
What's going on?

01:06:45.369 --> 01:06:47.970
- Come on.
- Just listen.

01:06:47.971 --> 01:06:50.973
These four women have breast cancer.

01:06:50.974 --> 01:06:55.544
What they've found are certain,
let's call them odd proteins,

01:06:55.545 --> 01:07:00.282
that have unique configurations in the
parent gene. Let's say these are them.

01:07:00.584 --> 01:07:05.254
We can identify them by
their unique, say, shape.

01:07:06.056 --> 01:07:10.026
Now, each parent donates
a gene to the child,

01:07:10.027 --> 01:07:12.628
and the genes get
all mixed up, right?

01:07:12.629 --> 01:07:16.565
But look. It's not
completely arbitrary.

01:07:16.566 --> 01:07:18.567
- We have news.
- Genetic markers.

01:07:18.568 --> 01:07:23.103
- We can track them through their families.
- And what we can call linkage.

01:07:24.173 --> 01:07:26.442
Do you see it?

01:07:26.443 --> 01:07:29.211
We now know that even though

01:07:29.212 --> 01:07:34.583
our genes get all mixed up when we're
conceived, certain markers remain.

01:07:34.584 --> 01:07:36.652
- Markers?
- Genetic markers.

01:07:36.653 --> 01:07:42.124
We can track them through the families.
It's like a signpost on a highway.

01:07:42.125 --> 01:07:44.193
Say you have two stretches
of road in the desert.

01:07:44.194 --> 01:07:45.795
- And they look exactly the same.
- Right.

01:07:45.796 --> 01:07:49.131
But if you pass signposts,
you can measure the intervals.

01:07:49.132 --> 01:07:50.833
And you can identify the
different stretches of road.

01:07:50.834 --> 01:07:52.702
Even if they look exactly the same.

01:07:52.703 --> 01:07:55.471
And if those markers are next to
something, like the breast cancer gene,

01:07:55.472 --> 01:07:58.774
- it can be identified.
- We now know that even though

01:07:58.775 --> 01:08:04.680
our genes get all mixed up when we're
conceived, certain markers remain.

01:08:05.582 --> 01:08:10.451
If we can find these markers, we're in
striking distance of finding our gene.

01:08:23.966 --> 01:08:28.938
<i>Kim kept encouraging me to go out.
I think she wanted me to meet someone.</i>

01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:32.475
Is your wife gonna
join you this evening?

01:08:32.475 --> 01:08:35.411
I, um...

01:08:35.412 --> 01:08:39.950
- I am no longer married.
- Mm-hmm.

01:08:41.852 --> 01:08:44.185
- So is your girlfriend coming later?
- Really?

01:08:44.187 --> 01:08:48.823
- That's really none of your business.
- Mm-hmm.

01:08:49.225 --> 01:08:51.327
Hey, is your daddy's
girlfriend coming tonight?

01:08:51.328 --> 01:08:53.929
Dad doesn't have a girlfriend.

01:08:54.331 --> 01:08:58.234
<i>- At a peewee hockey game, I met Marshall.</i>
- I'm sorry about my friend.

01:08:58.234 --> 01:09:00.036
I'm Marshall.

01:09:00.037 --> 01:09:01.370
- I'm Annie.
- Hi.

01:09:01.371 --> 01:09:05.506
<i>Only a Canadian girl meets a
man at a peewee hockey game.</i>

a wonderful thing?</i>

<i>Isn't Christmastime
a wonderful thing?</i>

01:09:55.057 --> 01:09:57.759
- Dad!
- Hiya, sport!

01:10:01.530 --> 01:10:03.331
Hi, Paul.

01:10:12.074 --> 01:10:13.542
Hi.

01:10:13.543 --> 01:10:14.877
Yeah.

01:10:14.878 --> 01:10:17.179
- How are you?
- Hi.

01:10:17.180 --> 01:10:19.682
You look good. You look great.

01:10:19.683 --> 01:10:22.751
Really, really happy.

01:10:23.653 --> 01:10:25.346
You okay?

01:10:25.347 --> 01:10:28.324
Yeah. Doing all right.

01:10:28.325 --> 01:10:31.492
Been a little sick.

01:10:32.528 --> 01:10:35.831
So, um, Marshall.

01:10:35.832 --> 01:10:37.900
He's a good man.

01:10:37.901 --> 01:10:40.703
- Yeah, he is.
- Yeah.

01:10:40.704 --> 01:10:42.905
- You okay?
- Okay.

01:10:42.906 --> 01:10:46.874
Um, I'm gonna go
get some... some food.

01:10:47.910 --> 01:10:50.011
Come on, sport.

01:11:00.456 --> 01:11:02.591
Tom, you open up the betting.

01:11:02.592 --> 01:11:05.693
All right. Okay.

01:11:09.865 --> 01:11:13.801
Another bad hand, but what the heck?

01:11:16.172 --> 01:11:19.841
Fold.

01:11:23.345 --> 01:11:25.681
Annie. Annie.

01:11:25.682 --> 01:11:27.283
- Hey!
- I wanted to...

01:11:27.284 --> 01:11:30.485
I'm smiling at you,
but you can fuck off.

01:11:40.629 --> 01:11:42.565
This is fun.

01:11:42.566 --> 01:11:44.599
Yeah.

01:11:47.736 --> 01:11:50.938
- Good to see you, guys.
- You too, man.

01:11:59.448 --> 01:12:02.651
- I'd love to hear that conversation.
- Oh, no.

01:12:02.652 --> 01:12:07.055
- You invited them.
- Yeah, but I didn't think they'd interact.

01:12:08.357 --> 01:12:10.992
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

01:12:14.897 --> 01:12:17.233
Well, I'll be back.

01:12:17.234 --> 01:12:20.201
Great. Okay. Yeah. We're...

01:12:24.573 --> 01:12:27.276
Is it weird? Did it get weird?

01:12:27.277 --> 01:12:30.445
- Merry Christmas, Marshall.
- Merry Christmas.

01:12:32.681 --> 01:12:34.816
Here's to her.

01:12:35.318 --> 01:12:37.653
To Annie.

01:12:44.460 --> 01:12:46.962
Marshall.

01:12:47.864 --> 01:12:49.732
Marshall?

01:12:49.733 --> 01:12:52.000
I'm up here, hon.

01:12:52.102 --> 01:12:54.837
Marshall?

01:12:54.838 --> 01:12:58.407
I'm in here. I, uh...

01:12:59.309 --> 01:13:02.578
I found the key. I thought I'd...

01:13:02.579 --> 01:13:06.181
clean out this room. We could use
it as a guest room or, uh...

01:13:06.182 --> 01:13:08.751
- No, you didn't.
- ...a study.

01:13:08.752 --> 01:13:11.453
Keep your helixes in here.

01:13:11.454 --> 01:13:16.356
- <i> Did Mommy wake him up?
- Yes, she did.</i>

01:13:16.425 --> 01:13:19.427
No. You let him out.

01:13:20.863 --> 01:13:23.132
You let him out.

01:13:23.133 --> 01:13:25.734
- Who?
- You...

01:13:25.735 --> 01:13:28.270
There's no one here.

01:13:28.271 --> 01:13:30.906
- It's just a room.
- You can't go in that room.

01:13:30.907 --> 01:13:34.075
- You let him out.
- Honey, no.

01:13:34.277 --> 01:13:36.711
It's just a...

01:13:44.853 --> 01:13:48.261
<i>Seriously, I wouldn't believe
this either, except it happened.</i>

01:13:48.262 --> 01:13:51.959
<i>Louise called me and
told me that Paul was ill.</i>

01:13:56.032 --> 01:13:58.666
Hey, um...

01:14:00.469 --> 01:14:04.571
Doctor says colorectal cancer.

01:14:04.773 --> 01:14:07.742
Hey, um...

01:14:09.578 --> 01:14:14.617
I was looking through
these, and, uh...

01:14:16.319 --> 01:14:19.187
thought you might wanna see them.

01:14:28.263 --> 01:14:31.265
You gonna be okay with William?

01:14:33.068 --> 01:14:37.305
- By yourself, I mean?
- Paul...

01:14:59.929 --> 01:15:03.565
<i>Imagine me and you</i>

01:15:03.967 --> 01:15:06.168
<i>I do</i>

01:15:07.070 --> 01:15:10.272
<i>- Think about you day and night
- Day and night</i>

01:15:10.273 --> 01:15:12.408
<i>It's only right</i>

01:15:12.409 --> 01:15:16.545
<i>To think about the girl you love</i>

01:15:16.546 --> 01:15:23.083
<i>and hold her tight So happy together</i>

01:15:28.691 --> 01:15:31.625
What did you ever see in me?

01:15:33.962 --> 01:15:37.800
I loved the careless,

01:15:37.801 --> 01:15:41.469
boundless, wildness of you.

01:15:42.504 --> 01:15:45.306
Then what happened?

01:15:47.042 --> 01:15:50.177
You were boundless and careless.

01:16:00.522 --> 01:16:01.990
Paul.

01:16:01.991 --> 01:16:05.060
Hey, listen.

01:16:05.061 --> 01:16:07.696
I want you to do something for me.

01:16:07.697 --> 01:16:12.101
- What is that?
- I want you to believe.

01:16:13.403 --> 01:16:15.771
Believe in what?

01:16:15.772 --> 01:16:18.740
Believe in anything.

01:16:19.142 --> 01:16:21.976
Come on, Annie.

01:16:22.178 --> 01:16:25.113
Come on. It worked for me.

01:16:26.015 --> 01:16:30.083
Uh, no offense, but...

01:16:30.853 --> 01:16:35.891
believing that there's some
miracle cure out there

01:16:35.892 --> 01:16:39.193
that no one knows about, that's...

01:16:39.295 --> 01:16:42.529
You gotta believe in something.

01:16:43.632 --> 01:16:45.501
I do.

01:16:45.502 --> 01:16:48.769
I do believe in something, Annie.

01:16:57.246 --> 01:17:00.614
I believe in cancer.

01:17:02.551 --> 01:17:06.320
And you know what else
I believe in, Annie?

01:17:07.556 --> 01:17:10.082
I believe...

01:17:10.083 --> 01:17:13.418
that I am going to die.

01:17:40.956 --> 01:17:42.923
Okay.

01:17:50.566 --> 01:17:54.034
I'm gonna go now, okay, sweetie?

01:18:03.812 --> 01:18:07.549
<i>Just like he said he
would, Paul died.</i>

01:18:07.550 --> 01:18:10.352
<i>I realized then that
was the difference,</i>

01:18:10.353 --> 01:18:14.923
<i>and that was the answer to the question
everyone was always asking me.</i>

01:18:14.924 --> 01:18:20.162
<i>Paul didn't believe in
anything in the end. I did.</i>

01:18:20.163 --> 01:18:23.198
<i>I believed in my genes
and chromosomes.</i>

01:18:23.199 --> 01:18:27.970
<i>I believed in my helix, and I
believed in predispositions.</i>

01:18:27.971 --> 01:18:31.306
<i>Faith. It may not seem like faith,</i>

01:18:31.307 --> 01:18:35.778
<i>not as you might
think it, but it is.</i>

01:18:35.779 --> 01:18:40.148
<i>And maybe those who say
faith sustains us are right.</i>

01:18:40.149 --> 01:18:43.518
<i>And maybe it doesn't matter
what we have faith in</i>

01:18:43.519 --> 01:18:47.088
<i>as long as it's faith in something,</i>

01:18:47.089 --> 01:18:49.790
<i>like the future.</i>

01:18:52.427 --> 01:18:56.699
My brother died of lung
cancer, uh, and colon cancer.

01:18:56.700 --> 01:19:00.602
I had never seen cancer until
I saw colon cancer, okay?

01:19:00.603 --> 01:19:04.239
Blood coming out of everywhere,
and it was just...

01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:08.343
I don't know how you can go on.
I don't think I could.

01:19:08.344 --> 01:19:12.381
It's agony. It's the
shit I deal with.

01:19:12.382 --> 01:19:15.315
I know what it's like.

01:19:39.241 --> 01:19:43.878
Yeah. I'm telling you,
it was the same guy.

01:19:44.380 --> 01:19:47.814
Either one or both of
the parents were...

01:19:48.383 --> 01:19:52.586
- Or they both had the receptive...
- One of the parents had some...

01:19:55.357 --> 01:19:59.059
Yeah. It seemed random.

01:20:07.169 --> 01:20:09.537
You okay, Annie?

01:20:15.645 --> 01:20:19.414
I'm afraid I don't have
good news for you.

01:20:19.415 --> 01:20:22.651
We found malignant tumors
on both your ovaries,

01:20:22.652 --> 01:20:27.355
with involvement of the fallopian
tubes and elsewhere in your abdomen.

01:20:27.457 --> 01:20:30.158
Do you understand what I just said?

01:20:30.159 --> 01:20:34.830
Now, while you do have an
advanced form of ovarian cancer,

01:20:34.831 --> 01:20:37.666
we removed everything that we found.

01:20:37.667 --> 01:20:43.270
Anything left is potentially
curable with chemotherapy.

01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:47.742
Advanced?

01:20:47.944 --> 01:20:50.211
Stage three.

01:20:50.313 --> 01:20:53.215
You have a long,
hard fight ahead of you.

01:20:53.216 --> 01:20:57.519
- I'm 37.
- Oh, that's very young.

01:20:58.221 --> 01:21:01.923
You rest, and we'll
talk later, all right?

01:21:11.066 --> 01:21:14.703
All right. I've reviewed
your pathology reports,

01:21:14.704 --> 01:21:17.973
and it's good you had the surgery.

01:21:17.974 --> 01:21:23.711
Please, Doctor. You know I
prefer bad news. Cheers me up.

01:21:23.813 --> 01:21:27.449
With what we're seeing
on your path reports,

01:21:27.450 --> 01:21:31.520
I have to tell you,
this type of cancer

01:21:31.521 --> 01:21:36.625
responds best to a combination
of chemotherapy drugs.

01:21:36.626 --> 01:21:41.830
We'd like you to receive
cisplatin and cyclophosphamide.

01:21:41.831 --> 01:21:45.166
Maybe ten or twelve treatments.

01:21:45.568 --> 01:21:47.402
How long?

01:21:47.403 --> 01:21:51.038
Altogether, a year or so.

01:21:56.278 --> 01:22:00.481
- I've been here before.
- I know you have.

01:22:02.584 --> 01:22:06.919
So what do you say? Hmm?

01:22:20.569 --> 01:22:23.738
Damn, you're hot.

01:22:41.489 --> 01:22:43.557
I need some water.

01:22:43.659 --> 01:22:47.662
One breast, no hair.

01:22:47.663 --> 01:22:51.631
They all want you,
but they can't have you.

01:22:56.004 --> 01:22:58.306
Just hold on a minute.

01:22:59.008 --> 01:23:00.941
Sorry.

01:23:09.885 --> 01:23:14.723
I'm gonna be sick. I'm gonna
be sick. I'm gonna be sick.

01:23:15.825 --> 01:23:17.624
Oh!

01:23:22.264 --> 01:23:25.400
You are so hot, baby.

01:23:25.401 --> 01:23:29.070
One breast, no hair.

01:23:29.071 --> 01:23:33.108
What's weird is that you want
your mom. I just want my mommy.

01:23:33.109 --> 01:23:35.776
I just want my mommy.

01:23:37.679 --> 01:23:40.382
- You need the nurse?
- I'm in too much pain.

01:23:40.383 --> 01:23:44.386
- You need the nurse?
- I want... I'm in too much pain.

01:23:44.387 --> 01:23:47.455
Okay. Are you comfortable?

01:23:47.456 --> 01:23:50.692
No. I'm hot. Let me take...

01:23:50.693 --> 01:23:53.128
I'll take 'em off.

01:23:53.830 --> 01:23:56.498
They all want you,

01:23:56.499 --> 01:23:59.233
but they can't have you.

01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:21.421
- It hurts me.
- I know, sweetie.

01:24:23.491 --> 01:24:25.993
It really hurts.

01:24:27.562 --> 01:24:29.964
No.

01:24:30.366 --> 01:24:32.866
No, they can't.

01:25:07.902 --> 01:25:10.704
Dr. King, are you all right?

01:25:16.477 --> 01:25:19.014
- Dr. King, are you...
- Maybe there's something acting

01:25:19.015 --> 01:25:24.885
on these genes. Maybe it's not happening
independently or spontaneously.

01:25:28.223 --> 01:25:31.126
Controlling genes.

01:25:31.127 --> 01:25:34.795
Squeeze one more time for me.

01:25:34.897 --> 01:25:36.931
Okay. Okay.

01:25:36.932 --> 01:25:40.702
Well, let's try the other arm, hmm?

01:25:40.703 --> 01:25:42.470
Sorry, Annie.

01:25:42.471 --> 01:25:46.474
This happens when you've
had too much chemo.

01:25:46.475 --> 01:25:50.545
The veins get scarred
and are hard to use.

01:25:50.546 --> 01:25:53.248
Like a junkie.

01:25:54.150 --> 01:25:58.086
Well, next time,
I'll put in a portacath.

01:25:58.087 --> 01:26:02.390
- That'll last several sessions.
- Okay.

01:26:02.391 --> 01:26:04.993
Yeah? I think we've found one.

01:26:04.994 --> 01:26:07.427
- Yay.
- Right there.

01:26:09.931 --> 01:26:12.434
- Hey.
- Wow.

01:26:12.435 --> 01:26:16.671
- Cancer <i> haute couture.</i>
- Ta-da!

01:26:17.573 --> 01:26:22.076
- Not a good look, then?
- It's... a look.

01:26:24.746 --> 01:26:28.815
Thanks, Brian. Thank you.

01:26:31.086 --> 01:26:34.254
- They're beautiful.
- You are.

01:26:36.891 --> 01:26:39.461
- What's going on?
- Excellent question.

01:26:39.462 --> 01:26:42.931
Let me show you what's going on.
Maybe you can figure it out for us.

01:26:42.932 --> 01:26:45.066
Look around you. What do you see?

01:26:45.067 --> 01:26:46.568
A lot of paper.

01:26:46.569 --> 01:26:48.770
Each paper represents
parts of chromosomes

01:26:48.771 --> 01:26:51.740
that we suspect may be active in
the cancer of our test patients.

01:26:51.741 --> 01:26:55.310
In other words, these areas are
variants, mutations in the DNA.

01:26:55.311 --> 01:26:58.279
- Our 350... all cancer sufferers.
- Why are there so many?

01:26:58.280 --> 01:27:00.582
Because it represents
many generations.

01:27:00.583 --> 01:27:03.318
- See these red dots?
- Yeah.

01:27:03.319 --> 01:27:07.155
Wherever they appear is
an indication of a mutation.

01:27:07.156 --> 01:27:10.759
Black lines... morbidity, death.

01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:13.428
So there's a lot of mutation?

01:27:13.429 --> 01:27:16.231
Yeah. Everyone's DNA has a
certain amount of variation.

01:27:16.232 --> 01:27:19.968
What we're looking for is a mutation the
same place on the same chromosome.

01:27:19.969 --> 01:27:22.237
Mary-Claire, if we're looking
for patients who have...

01:27:22.238 --> 01:27:24.439
- a predisposition to breast cancer...
- Yes.

01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:26.941
That would suggest that they
were born with a mutated gene.

01:27:26.942 --> 01:27:29.544
- Yes.
- But most cancers occur later in life,

01:27:29.545 --> 01:27:33.515
- when the telomeres are reduced in size.
- Right.

01:27:33.516 --> 01:27:36.217
So if we concentrate on women
who have early-onset cancer,

01:27:36.218 --> 01:27:39.921
we'd be much more likely to find
women who have a predisposition.

01:27:39.922 --> 01:27:42.724
We were presuming that all breast
cancers were caused by the same thing.

01:27:42.725 --> 01:27:45.121
Yes, but if they have similar
tumors but different causes...

01:27:45.122 --> 01:27:48.829
And we just look at women
with early-onset cancer...

01:27:50.932 --> 01:27:52.900
Do it.

01:27:55.403 --> 01:27:57.205
Average age, 28.

01:27:57.206 --> 01:28:00.207
- 40.
- 35.

01:28:04.579 --> 01:28:06.880
Where is it?

01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:13.955
It's here.

01:28:14.857 --> 01:28:17.025
And here.

01:28:18.327 --> 01:28:20.595
And here.

01:28:21.297 --> 01:28:23.664
And here.

01:28:23.866 --> 01:28:25.999
And here.

01:28:31.639 --> 01:28:34.074
We found our gene.

01:28:36.578 --> 01:28:39.346
That's Mary-Claire King.

01:28:39.448 --> 01:28:43.885
There's a link. There's a link.
You understand what I'm saying?

01:28:43.886 --> 01:28:49.257
There's a genetic link between
mothers and daughters

01:28:49.258 --> 01:28:53.360
and sisters who have
had breast cancer.

01:28:53.562 --> 01:28:57.664
See, there's a predisposition.
A kind of mutation.

01:28:57.866 --> 01:29:00.535
There's a link.

01:29:01.437 --> 01:29:03.537
You were right.

01:29:07.709 --> 01:29:10.077
Excuse me.

01:30:58.820 --> 01:31:03.458
Hello. Hi. Hey, I heard
the good news.

01:31:03.459 --> 01:31:07.729
- Allen, she's in Cincinnati.
- Cincinnati?

01:31:07.730 --> 01:31:09.797
They could hardly believe it.

01:31:09.798 --> 01:31:12.834
Yeah, well, they
believe her now, huh?

01:31:12.835 --> 01:31:16.435
They do. Anybody who
ever doubted us. Well, her.

01:31:16.436 --> 01:31:18.177
- She did it.
- A single gene.

01:31:18.178 --> 01:31:21.140
- Pretty much.
- Incredible.

01:31:21.466 --> 01:31:22.877
So, what now?

01:31:22.878 --> 01:31:24.445
Oh, there's still lots to be done.

01:31:24.446 --> 01:31:27.448
We have to pinpoint the
precise gene and sequence it.

01:31:27.449 --> 01:31:30.350
Yeah, well, that's
where the money is.

01:31:32.587 --> 01:31:35.023
- The money?
- Yeah. Lots and lots and lots of money.

01:31:35.024 --> 01:31:38.908
You sequence the gene,
and then you patent it. It's yours.

01:31:38.909 --> 01:31:44.806
Do me a favor, will you? Say
good-bye to Dr. King for me.

01:31:44.933 --> 01:31:46.935
And, uh...

01:31:48.837 --> 01:31:52.806
you know, congrats and
all that. She is something.

01:32:03.884 --> 01:32:05.686
- Excuse me, Dr. King?
- I'm sorry.

01:32:05.687 --> 01:32:08.189
I don't have any more time.
I'm already late for my plane.

01:32:08.190 --> 01:32:11.825
- My name's Annie Parker.
- Thanks.

01:32:13.928 --> 01:32:16.097
Oh.

01:32:16.999 --> 01:32:19.133
I read your letters.

01:32:19.134 --> 01:32:21.302
I heard you were in town.

01:32:21.303 --> 01:32:25.406
I tried to catch your lecture,
but the traffic was horrible.

01:32:25.407 --> 01:32:28.643
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay. It was a bit dry.

01:32:28.644 --> 01:32:31.379
My jokes didn't play very well.

01:32:32.181 --> 01:32:34.948
- So I...
- I've wanted to meet you.

01:32:36.551 --> 01:32:39.454
I wanted to meet you, too.

01:32:39.455 --> 01:32:44.290
So I heard they patented
our gene... your gene.

01:32:44.759 --> 01:32:47.295
That's right. They have.

01:32:47.296 --> 01:32:50.076
So does that mean we get a discount
on it in the future if we need it,

01:32:50.077 --> 01:32:54.944
- like a Sears card?
- It's not a cure, of course.

01:32:55.571 --> 01:33:00.308
No. Yeah. I heard, but it's a start.

01:33:00.309 --> 01:33:02.810
That's right. It's a start.

01:33:03.712 --> 01:33:06.681
- That's a pretty necklace.
- Thank you.

01:33:06.682 --> 01:33:10.850
It was my mom's.
I had it restrung recently.

01:33:11.686 --> 01:33:13.054
- You know, she...
- Hey, I'm sorry.

01:33:13.055 --> 01:33:18.625
I really do have to go. I hope
we can speak again. All the best.

01:33:38.212 --> 01:33:40.815
You are a remarkable woman,

01:33:40.816 --> 01:33:43.251
Anne Parker.

01:33:44.353 --> 01:33:48.589
I'm sorry... so sorry
I couldn't do more.

01:33:49.191 --> 01:33:54.093
You did so much. So very much.

01:34:25.393 --> 01:34:30.264
<i>Oh, the gentlemen are talking</i>

01:34:30.265 --> 01:34:35.136
<i>And the midnight moon
is on the riverside</i>

01:34:35.137 --> 01:34:40.408
<i>They're drinking up and walking</i>

01:34:40.409 --> 01:34:45.780
<i>And it is time for me to slide</i>

01:34:45.781 --> 01:34:50.084
<i>I live in another world</i>

01:34:50.085 --> 01:34:56.190
<i>Where life and death are memorized</i>

01:34:56.191 --> 01:35:01.195
<i>Where the earth is strung
with lover's pearls</i>

01:35:01.196 --> 01:35:07.633
<i>And all I see are dark eyes</i>

01:35:26.253 --> 01:35:30.191
<i>I can't control</i>

01:35:30.192 --> 01:35:34.628
<i>What life is now</i>

01:35:34.629 --> 01:35:41.267
<i>What will roll over me</i>

01:35:42.403 --> 01:35:46.374
<i>It's not freedom</i>

01:35:46.375 --> 01:35:49.910
<i>But it set you free</i>

01:35:49.911 --> 01:35:56.617
<i>So see yourself as free</i>

01:35:57.219 --> 01:36:04.957
<i>As I'm falling from your reach</i>

01:36:06.027 --> 01:36:09.964
<i>Don't forget</i>

01:36:09.965 --> 01:36:14.001
<i>Don't regret</i>

01:36:14.002 --> 01:36:17.938
<i>Don't dwell</i>

01:36:17.939 --> 01:36:21.876
<i>on the past</i>

01:36:21.877 --> 01:36:25.613
<i>Nothing left</i>

01:36:25.614 --> 01:36:29.583
<i>Nothing sacred</i>

01:36:29.584 --> 01:36:33.120
<i>Nothing pure</i>

01:36:33.121 --> 01:36:36.924
<i>is ever gonna last</i>

01:36:36.925 --> 01:36:40.528
<i>You should turn away from me</i>

01:36:40.529 --> 01:36:44.330
<i>As I drift away from you</i>

01:36:46.901 --> 01:36:50.938
<i>If time has spent</i>

01:36:50.939 --> 01:36:55.176
<i>and time has come</i>

01:36:55.177 --> 01:36:58.412
<i>to let me go</i>

01:36:58.413 --> 01:37:02.884
<i>and you to run</i>

01:37:02.885 --> 01:37:06.187
<i>Then let me leave</i>

01:37:06.188 --> 01:37:10.689
<i>and let me go</i>

01:37:10.792 --> 01:37:17.698

01:37:17.699 --> 01:37:25.471
