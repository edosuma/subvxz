00:33.440 --> 00:35.283
So you got everything?
Mm-hm.

00:35.440 --> 00:37.120
You gonna play
video games the whole flight

00:37.280 --> 00:39.965
or do you think you might
actually crack a book?

00:40.120 --> 00:41.531
Probably read some.

00:41.680 --> 00:45.162
Well, if I write you an e-mail,
don't be scared to write back.

00:45.320 --> 00:49.166
Let your old man know what you're
thinking about, what's going on.

00:49.360 --> 00:51.681
Yeah.
If you want, we could try Skyping

00:51.840 --> 00:53.968
once a week or something.
All right.

00:54.120 --> 00:55.565
Yeah. Okay.

00:55.720 --> 00:57.927
You got the drawings
for your science deal?

00:58.120 --> 00:59.167
Yeah, think so.

00:59.320 --> 01:02.164
Well, they turned out great,
by the way. Really great.

01:02.320 --> 01:03.651
Thanks.

01:03.840 --> 01:06.286
What...? Is your computer charged?
Yeah.

01:10.760 --> 01:14.481
What do you think is the first thing
you're gonna do when you get home?

01:14.640 --> 01:16.881
I don't know.
Hm? Oh.

01:17.160 --> 01:20.642
I really cherish this communication we have.
You know, it's just...

01:20.800 --> 01:22.882
Your answers are so...
What?

01:23.640 --> 01:26.291
Just keep practicing the piano.
You're really good.

01:26.520 --> 01:29.046
They spend so much time
at that school of yours...

01:29.240 --> 01:31.368
Music is something you'll use in life.

01:31.560 --> 01:34.291
And don't forget to...
You want those sesame things.

01:34.480 --> 01:35.891
Yeah.
All right.

01:37.960 --> 01:39.644
There you go.
Thank you.

01:39.840 --> 01:41.444
Okay.

01:41.640 --> 01:46.328
I'll probably make it over there in October.
I'll try to see you in that first recital.

01:46.520 --> 01:49.126
And hopefully catch
a soccer game while I'm there.

01:52.640 --> 01:55.484
I might not even play soccer
this year.

01:55.840 --> 01:58.081
Oh, that'd be a big mistake.
Trust me.

01:58.280 --> 02:01.011
I'm not that good.
Oh, no, you're pretty good.

02:01.200 --> 02:03.407
You are. Huh?

02:03.600 --> 02:07.400
I missed summer training camp. The
chances of me starting are miniscule.

02:07.640 --> 02:09.768
Well, just tell the coach
the situation.

02:09.960 --> 02:12.884
Your dad lives in Europe.
You really wanted to be there.

02:13.080 --> 02:16.402
You know, blah, blah, blah. Blame me."My
parents stink, but I'm really serious."

02:16.600 --> 02:18.648
But I'm not serious, Dad.

02:18.840 --> 02:21.047
I don't care that much.

02:21.880 --> 02:25.646
Well, you don't have to decide right now.
You know, just think about it.

02:25.800 --> 02:29.850
All I'm saying is that team sports
are important, you know?

02:32.080 --> 02:33.730
Here we are.

02:35.120 --> 02:37.407
I love this airport.
It's awesome.

02:37.600 --> 02:40.331
Heh. It's cool, right? You
excited about seeing your mom?

02:40.480 --> 02:41.845
Yeah, and all my friends.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.446
Yeah. What about your
boarding pass, passport?

02:44.680 --> 02:47.126
You feel confident
about making the connection?

02:47.320 --> 02:50.847
I did this before.
But not with a tricky connection like this.

02:51.040 --> 02:53.646
Remember, when you land,
you stay in your seat,

02:53.840 --> 02:57.526
somebody from the airline is gonna
take you to the gate, all right?

02:57.720 --> 03:01.486
It's not a problem.
Okay. All right. Heh-heh-heh.

03:02.080 --> 03:03.889
Oh, boy.

03:04.760 --> 03:09.721
Well, looks like maybe we should
just do this thing, huh? Hm?

03:09.960 --> 03:11.644
Okay, come here. Oh, God.

03:11.840 --> 03:14.366
I'm gonna do my best
to make that recital, okay?

03:15.520 --> 03:18.490
You know, I wouldn't bother.

03:19.080 --> 03:22.926
Heh. What makes you say that?
I'm not being mean, but it'd be easier

03:23.120 --> 03:26.044
if you didn't come to the recital.
How come?

03:26.240 --> 03:28.811
Be better if you visited
on a "nothing" weekend.

03:29.000 --> 03:33.324
But I wanna see you play.
It's because Mom hates you so much.

03:33.520 --> 03:37.650
She'd be really stressed if you were
there and then it'd be tense for me.

03:38.840 --> 03:41.446
You know, go on.
Thank you.

03:42.200 --> 03:46.649
We wouldn't have any time to hang out.
Don't worry. We'll figure that out.

03:46.840 --> 03:49.684
I just don't want you to worry
about it, you know?

03:49.880 --> 03:52.326
I mean, you know
how much I miss you, right?

03:56.640 --> 03:59.041
Why do you think
she still hates me so much?

03:59.200 --> 04:02.921
I don't know. I think she hates Daniel
more than she hates you.

04:03.320 --> 04:06.767
Right. Hey, don't worry.
I'll figure something out.

04:06.920 --> 04:09.207
We should just do this thing.
Yeah.

04:09.360 --> 04:11.203
Is there anything
I can do to help?

04:11.400 --> 04:13.880
I don't know.
But you know I love you, right?

04:14.080 --> 04:15.684
Yeah, I know.
All right.

04:15.880 --> 04:18.007
This has been the best summer
of my life.

04:18.200 --> 04:20.089
Really?
Yeah.

04:20.480 --> 04:21.527
Well, me too.

04:21.720 --> 04:24.326
I told you this Greece thing
was gonna be great.

04:24.520 --> 04:26.602
And it was.
Okay. All right.

04:26.760 --> 04:28.125
I love you, pal.

04:28.320 --> 04:29.810
Love you too, Dad.
Okay.

04:30.040 --> 04:32.361
Okay, shake my hand.
All right.

04:32.560 --> 04:34.528
Bye.
All right. See you.

05:44.920 --> 05:46.365
Okay.

06:20.960 --> 06:22.166
Okay.

06:27.080 --> 06:28.241
So, what's going on?

06:28.440 --> 06:31.171
They voted against it.
What? The wind turbines?

06:31.360 --> 06:35.160
Six months dealing with those people,
everyone agreed it was great.

06:35.320 --> 06:36.367
So, what happened?

06:36.520 --> 06:38.966
They don't like the way
it looks on that hill.

06:39.160 --> 06:41.481
No. I thought it was a done deal.
It was.

06:41.680 --> 06:44.251
That's what's so infuriating.
Can they do that?

06:44.440 --> 06:47.649
Of course, they've done it.
That's it. It's over, <i>finis.</i>

06:48.480 --> 06:50.881
I'm sorry.
No, no. It's just so frustrating.

06:51.040 --> 06:52.963
I can't take it anymore.

06:55.320 --> 06:57.527
I'm gonna take that job
with Remy.

06:57.720 --> 06:59.882
No, no. No, you don't
wanna work for him.

07:00.040 --> 07:01.963
Why not?
For the government?

07:02.120 --> 07:06.444
This is different. We need laws. That's
the only way anything is gonna happen.

07:06.600 --> 07:09.444
Not the only way. You have
been getting good work done.

07:09.600 --> 07:11.762
I've been thinking.
This is the way to go.

07:11.920 --> 07:14.161
Let me remind you
you do not like that guy.

07:14.320 --> 07:17.085
You worked for him before.
You complained about him.

07:17.240 --> 07:19.561
He gets things done.
That's how I'm gonna be.

07:19.720 --> 07:21.131
Okay.
A real bitch, okay?

07:21.280 --> 07:26.127
Well, every time I look at that guy, all I
see is ambition. Sorry, I don't trust him.

07:26.280 --> 07:29.887
He's going from nonprofit to government
to have people kiss his ass.

07:30.080 --> 07:31.445
I don't care about him.

07:31.680 --> 07:33.887
And I think
you're gonna be miserable.

07:34.080 --> 07:36.560
Just with all the politicking
and compromise.

07:36.760 --> 07:39.764
I've made my decision.
I'm tired of being the do-gooder

07:39.920 --> 07:42.651
that rolls a boulder up
and watches it roll down.

07:42.800 --> 07:46.088
Isn't Remy the guy who used to
throw his pens at his assistant?

07:46.240 --> 07:48.402
I should have taken
this job a year ago.

07:48.560 --> 07:52.770
I was scared of the amount of work, but
I think it's the best opportunity.

07:52.920 --> 07:55.241
And it's more money,
and I'm doing it.

07:55.440 --> 07:58.171
Okay. Are you sure?

07:58.360 --> 08:01.603
No, I'm not sure of anything, okay?
All right. Heh.

08:01.800 --> 08:04.041
What's gonna happen
to everyone if I leave?

08:04.240 --> 08:06.766
Like FranÃ§oise and...
I mean, they count on me.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.365
What do you think?

08:08.560 --> 08:11.245
Should I take it or not?
I don't have an opinion.

08:11.440 --> 08:15.445
I don't wanna see you rush into a
decision because of this wind turbine.

08:15.680 --> 08:18.331
Not just that. It's been
stirring in me all summer.

08:18.560 --> 08:19.891
I know.
I should do it.

08:20.080 --> 08:22.242
All right... Then do it.
I'm doing it.

08:22.400 --> 08:24.926
I'm doing it. All right?

08:26.240 --> 08:28.208
Oh, God.
I wish things were simpler.

08:28.440 --> 08:31.046
If I leave, I get fucked,
if I stay, I get fucked.

08:31.200 --> 08:32.480
Heh, heh.
There's always a catch.

08:32.640 --> 08:35.086
The world is fucked.
Yeah, maybe.

08:35.320 --> 08:39.563
Oh, God. We finally have a vacation
and the girls are sick for two weeks.

08:39.760 --> 08:43.481
I know. I have the perfect son.
He lives a million miles away.

08:44.000 --> 08:49.166
Or the love of your life can't clean up
after himself or learn how to shave.

08:49.400 --> 08:52.643
Who's that? I mean, you're not
talking about Captain Cleanup.

08:52.840 --> 08:56.765
Captain Cleanup. The one that's been
missing in action all these years.

08:56.920 --> 08:58.490
What'd you expect at this point

08:58.680 --> 09:02.287
in your life, missy?
Ay, ay, ay! God.

09:03.400 --> 09:05.448
Oh, look at them.
They're so cute.

09:05.640 --> 09:08.041
They look like conjoined twins.
Heh.

09:08.240 --> 09:10.447
Oh, my God,
I'm gonna take a picture.

09:10.640 --> 09:14.247
Hey, did Ella finish that apple?

09:14.880 --> 09:17.201
The...
Take food out of your child's mouth?

09:17.360 --> 09:18.805
Yeah.
Okay.

09:18.960 --> 09:21.361
Well, it's all brown.

09:21.520 --> 09:24.046
No, no, no,
there's a spot here.

09:26.200 --> 09:27.486
Mm.

09:27.640 --> 09:32.931
Ella, this is evidence of your
father stealing food from you.

09:33.080 --> 09:35.003
If you become bulimic
or anorexic,

09:35.160 --> 09:36.685
Heh. Jesus.
It's not my fault.

09:36.840 --> 09:40.287
Don't blame it all on your mother.
Ella, this is a family apple.

09:40.440 --> 09:43.046
I'm teaching you the value of sharing.
I love you, honey.

09:43.200 --> 09:45.248
Aw. So sweet.

09:45.480 --> 09:48.290
You will remember this vacation
different than we will.

09:48.520 --> 09:50.568
That's for sure.
I see that with my mom.

09:50.720 --> 09:53.166
She remembers my childhood
different than I do.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.840
Please, stop filming me.
Okay.

09:56.440 --> 09:59.922
God. I love your mom.
You're always so hard on her.

10:00.160 --> 10:03.528
You missed the fucked-up years.
You're just getting the good era.

10:03.680 --> 10:07.048
The fucked-up years. Heh, heh. That
reminds me, talking about fucked up,

10:07.200 --> 10:11.171
did I ever tell you the story
of my little Cleopatra kitty?

10:11.720 --> 10:15.281
No.
No? I think you would remember if I did.

10:15.480 --> 10:19.849
It's the story... You know, when I was a
little girl, I had this cat named Cleopatra.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.731
Every spring, she'd jump
the fence, get pregnant

10:22.880 --> 10:27.010
and always end up
with a litter of exactly two kittens.

10:27.200 --> 10:28.770
Two kitties, huh?
Two kitties.

10:28.960 --> 10:30.928
Every time, every year,
two cats.

10:31.120 --> 10:32.724
I mean, it's just amazing.

10:32.920 --> 10:36.766
Then one day, I was, like, around 30,
and was having lunch with my dad

10:36.920 --> 10:39.969
and I was remembering...
Mentioning little Cleopatra,

10:40.200 --> 10:41.281
and he was like:

10:41.480 --> 10:46.202
"The hardest thing I ever had to do
was to kill those cute little kittens."

10:46.400 --> 10:47.606
And I was like, "What?"

10:47.800 --> 10:50.531
It turns out... Listen to this.

10:50.720 --> 10:53.644
There were sometimes
up to seven kittens in that litter.

10:53.840 --> 10:54.887
Oh, no.

10:55.040 --> 10:57.042
He would take five of them,
Oh, no.

10:57.200 --> 10:59.407
Put them into a bag
with a bunch of ether.

10:59.560 --> 11:01.688
That's terrible.

11:02.080 --> 11:03.127
That was like...

11:03.320 --> 11:06.449
He had forgotten the lie he
and my mom had told me as a kid.

11:06.680 --> 11:09.729
How did he decide which ones to kill?
I asked him that.

11:09.920 --> 11:13.447
"Did you take the fluffiest? Cutest?"
Right.

11:13.600 --> 11:16.126
You know?
He just started to cry.

11:16.320 --> 11:18.448
Aw.
Poor Daddy.

11:18.680 --> 11:21.684
Oh. We said we were gonna stop.
They wanted to see the ruins.

11:21.880 --> 11:22.927
Should we?

11:23.160 --> 11:24.650
Well, Ella really wanted to.

11:24.840 --> 11:28.128
- But should we wake them up?
- I don't know.

11:28.320 --> 11:31.290
On our way back to the airport,
we can catch them. Hm?

11:31.480 --> 11:33.244
You know we won't.
Probably not.

11:33.400 --> 11:34.561
Oh, God.

11:34.720 --> 11:36.722
So long, ancient ruins.
Shh.

11:36.920 --> 11:39.571
What's so great about you anyway?
Seen one, seen them all.

11:41.120 --> 11:44.408
Oh, my God. We are shitty parents.
We should have stopped.

11:44.560 --> 11:46.369
Ah, it's okay.
It's culture. Go back.

11:46.520 --> 11:49.444
You gotta put character into these kids.
Yeah, yeah.

11:49.640 --> 11:53.725
We're teaching them a valuable lesson.
If you snooze, you lose in this world.

11:53.920 --> 11:56.366
And when the girls are in rehab
Ha-ha-ha.

11:56.520 --> 11:59.285
Recovering from 10 years
of addiction to coke and speed,

11:59.480 --> 12:02.484
they'll say, "We never felt
comfortable falling asleep."

12:02.680 --> 12:06.844
"Daddy used to tell us, 'You snooze, you
lose."' And that'll be your fault again.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.731
Yeah, well, we are shitty parents.
I know.

12:09.880 --> 12:13.089
Oh... Saying goodbye
to Hank sucked.

12:13.800 --> 12:14.961
Why, was he upset?

12:15.160 --> 12:18.403
No, no. He said it was
the best summer of his life.

12:18.600 --> 12:19.931
Well, that's great.

12:20.120 --> 12:23.681
I mean, I wouldn't worry too much
about him. We spoke a bunch.

12:23.880 --> 12:27.089
You know what his main concerns are?
What?

12:27.280 --> 12:31.285
Pimples and how girls perceive him.
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

12:31.520 --> 12:34.000
What do you mean? I'm not like that.
Oh, please.

12:34.160 --> 12:35.764
What?
That's all you think about.

12:35.920 --> 12:38.127
What?
Women. I mean...

12:38.280 --> 12:42.285
Heh. I'm not complaining,
I'm getting a lot of attention.

12:42.480 --> 12:47.008
But you never stop ogling girls, like:
I don't ogle girls. I don't ogle girls.

12:47.240 --> 12:51.404
I make love to them with my eyes.

12:51.560 --> 12:53.881
I like the Spanish guy.
Or is it Greek?

12:54.120 --> 12:57.806
I don't know where I'm from,
but I'm very hairy.

13:02.120 --> 13:05.966
Well, I think... You know,
Henry might have, you know...

13:06.160 --> 13:07.207
What?

13:07.400 --> 13:10.085
With that little Melina girl.

13:10.280 --> 13:13.284
I don't know.
He had a crush, but...

13:13.520 --> 13:14.726
Oh, are you kidding?
What?

13:14.920 --> 13:18.049
Why do you think he said
it was the best summer of his life?

13:18.240 --> 13:20.720
Because he and I
had a good time together?

13:22.400 --> 13:23.890
Jesse.
No, huh?

13:24.080 --> 13:26.481
So, what, you think they...?
Of course.

13:26.680 --> 13:29.001
They kissed?
Yeah, they kissed. Yeah, yeah.

13:29.240 --> 13:32.323
I was sworn to secrecy, but he told me.
What did he say?

13:32.520 --> 13:35.091
I'm not supposed to tell you.
I'm not gonna talk.

13:35.280 --> 13:37.009
Hey, hey. Come on.
Okay.

13:37.200 --> 13:41.649
He told me he was worried... You
know, concerned about the kissing.

13:41.880 --> 13:43.370
You know, tongue. Her tongue.

13:43.520 --> 13:45.443
What, he kissed her?
Yeah.

13:45.640 --> 13:50.089
But he was so cute, all nervous,
all red, biting his cheek.

13:50.280 --> 13:51.645
Like when he was little.

13:51.840 --> 13:54.320
So he and Melina were a real thing?
Yeah.

13:54.560 --> 13:56.483
What's gonna happen now?

13:56.680 --> 13:59.126
I don't know. They must be
friends on Facebook.

13:59.320 --> 14:02.005
Keep in touch for a while.
Hey, hey. What if they end up

14:02.160 --> 14:05.448
spending their life together, you know?
You're so corny.

14:05.640 --> 14:07.369
Ha-ha-ha. No.
Sometimes, I'm just like...

14:07.520 --> 14:09.887
What are you, a 12-year-old girl?
I'm just...

14:10.080 --> 14:12.686
First love, do you even
remember who it was?

14:12.880 --> 14:16.805
Yeah, I do. It was you.
Oh, please, like you were a virgin at 23.

14:17.040 --> 14:19.805
You said first love,
not first sexual experience.

14:20.040 --> 14:22.964
Fine. I'm the first woman
you ever fell in love with?

14:23.160 --> 14:24.446
Yeah.
I don't think so.

14:24.640 --> 14:28.611
First one I felt truly connected to, sure.
What, I wasn't your first love?

14:29.760 --> 14:32.604
No, of course not.
Oh.

14:34.440 --> 14:37.569
No, I just... I thought I was.
Oh... Ha-ha-ha.

14:37.720 --> 14:40.326
Jesse, stop this. It's dumb.
It's okay. Not a big deal.

14:40.560 --> 14:42.961
No. Okay, how old are you?
Come on.

14:43.160 --> 14:46.209
I'm 41 and I've loved only you.

14:52.000 --> 14:55.482
You are so, so working
on our little night already.

14:55.680 --> 15:01.642
Hell, yeah. I got a Trojan in my
billfold, and a rocket in my pocket.

15:01.800 --> 15:05.043
I'm stuck with
an American teenager.

15:05.320 --> 15:07.084
I can't believe it.

15:07.280 --> 15:09.760
Do we have to do
all that stuff later?

15:09.960 --> 15:12.088
What? Oh, yeah, come on.

15:12.280 --> 15:16.251
It means a lot to Patrick. Ariadni and
Stefanos are already there prepping.

15:16.440 --> 15:18.681
The kids wanted one more big time.
No, no.

15:18.840 --> 15:20.569
No, no,
but I meant the hotel later.

15:21.920 --> 15:24.571
I'm not sure I want to go...
Hi, sweetie.

15:24.760 --> 15:26.091
Yeah.

15:26.320 --> 15:29.529
Oh, okay, okay, okay.
Well, it's fine. It's fine.

15:29.720 --> 15:32.485
Call me from London.
Have a good flight. Bye.

15:32.640 --> 15:35.371
They were telling them
to turn everything off.

15:35.520 --> 15:39.889
And I asked him to call me from
the plane. I don't like when he flies.

15:46.400 --> 15:47.925
What?

15:49.680 --> 15:52.001
What is it?
It's just...

15:52.200 --> 15:54.806
I don't know.
I don't know. I don't...

15:55.520 --> 15:57.887
I just don't think I can keep
doing this.

15:58.080 --> 15:59.525
What?

15:59.760 --> 16:03.651
It's just every summer, every Christmas.
You know, it's like...

16:04.280 --> 16:07.841
I mean... It wouldn't be so bad,
It makes me ill every time.

16:08.040 --> 16:12.489
You know, like if we were sending
him to boarding school or just...

16:12.680 --> 16:15.843
I don't know, if his mom and I
got along a little bit better.

16:16.040 --> 16:18.771
It's like we're sending him back
across enemy lines.

16:18.960 --> 16:20.405
It really hit me this time.

16:20.600 --> 16:23.809
It's, like, he's gonna be
a freshman in high school.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.606
Four more years
and he's gonna be on his own.

16:26.800 --> 16:30.168
Maybe that's good. Only four years.
This is the crucial time.

16:30.360 --> 16:34.843
I just feel like I should be there for him.
Like it's now or never, you know?

16:35.480 --> 16:37.403
No. What do you mean?

16:38.520 --> 16:42.491
I just thought somehow he'd end up
living with us somewhere along the way.

16:42.680 --> 16:44.489
You know,
time's going by so fast.

16:44.680 --> 16:46.489
And here we are, it's high school.

16:46.680 --> 16:50.526
There's girls. Next thing you know,
it's college applications.

16:50.720 --> 16:52.484
You're right, maybe it's time.

16:52.680 --> 16:57.049
I mean, it's time to tell his mom all this
and ask if he can come and live with us.

16:57.240 --> 16:59.527
He'd love it.
We can put him in that bilin...

16:59.680 --> 17:01.967
That's never gonna happen,
all right?

17:02.160 --> 17:05.767
She's never gonna give me one thing
she's not legally obligated to.

17:06.000 --> 17:09.446
You wanna call that lawyer again?
No. He's terrible.

17:09.640 --> 17:11.085
Should I call his mother?

17:11.280 --> 17:13.487
Uh, no. Please. Never again.

17:13.720 --> 17:16.451
Look, he doesn't even know
how to throw a baseball.

17:16.680 --> 17:18.125
Who cares?

17:18.319 --> 17:22.244
It's just... He leads with his elbow.
He throws like a girl.

17:22.440 --> 17:25.090
It's not your fault.
No, it is my fault.

17:25.280 --> 17:29.046
A father is supposed to teach you that.
He just doesn't like baseball.

17:29.240 --> 17:31.971
It's an example.
It's a metaphor for everything.

17:32.160 --> 17:36.051
He's turning 14,
and he needs his father.

17:39.360 --> 17:41.522
Jesse, I'm not moving to Chicago.

17:41.720 --> 17:45.361
Did I ask you to? Where did that
come from? I'm thinking out loud.

17:45.560 --> 17:48.450
This is the one thing I promised
myself I'd never do

17:48.640 --> 17:50.449
and I look up and I'm doing it.

17:50.640 --> 17:54.645
Well, listen, you're a wonderful father.
He loves the relationship you have.

17:54.840 --> 17:57.605
He loves the letters.
He doesn't read the letters.

17:57.800 --> 18:01.486
He reads them. He doesn't compliment.
I know if I miss these years,

18:01.680 --> 18:03.762
they are never coming back.

18:05.680 --> 18:08.763
Oh, my God.
What?

18:08.920 --> 18:11.287
This is where it ends.

18:12.240 --> 18:13.685
What are you talking about?

18:13.880 --> 18:16.360
This is how people start breaking up.
Oh, my God.

18:16.560 --> 18:19.291
You just jumped off a cliff.
No, I'm marking this.

18:19.440 --> 18:23.809
This is the day you light the ticking
bomb that will destroy our lives.

18:25.480 --> 18:26.527
Yeah.
Okay.

18:26.720 --> 18:29.326
First, you don't light
a ticking bomb. You set it.

18:29.520 --> 18:34.082
It has a timer. That's why it ticks.
Whatever. Well, it's ticking right now.

18:34.280 --> 18:38.126
This is how it happens. You're unhappy,
you blame it on the other person.

18:38.280 --> 18:42.001
Resentment grows, you break up.
You're just doing this to shut me up.

18:42.160 --> 18:44.401
Not at all. No.
That's what you're doing.

18:44.600 --> 18:47.410
I'm surprised we lasted this long.
The hyperbole.

18:47.640 --> 18:50.644
We're on parallel tracks,
but now the tracks have crossed.

18:50.800 --> 18:52.609
I'm going west. You're going east.

18:52.800 --> 18:56.088
This is how it happens. I've seen it.
Katherine and Alexander...

18:56.320 --> 18:58.926
You're kidding, right? You're kidding?
Well, no.

18:59.120 --> 19:00.406
I'm kidding.

19:00.600 --> 19:02.170
And I'm not.

19:02.520 --> 19:03.567
All right?

19:03.760 --> 19:05.330
I'm just...

19:05.520 --> 19:08.364
This is it.
How much longer to the ruins?

19:08.560 --> 19:10.767
Oh, they were closed.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.126
Yeah.
We... Yeah.

19:12.320 --> 19:16.041
We're gonna catch them on the way
back when we're going to the airport.

19:16.240 --> 19:17.287
Okay?
Exactly.

19:17.480 --> 19:20.086
We'll leave early, right? Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah.

19:20.280 --> 19:22.521
What happened to my apple?

19:22.760 --> 19:24.967
Your apple.

19:29.920 --> 19:31.649
Right?

19:47.200 --> 19:49.168
Give me the list.
I don't have it.

19:49.360 --> 19:50.964
It's in your wallet.

19:51.160 --> 19:52.525
In your wallet.

19:52.720 --> 19:54.529
Okay.
Yeah.

19:56.040 --> 19:58.202
Okay, I'm the general.

20:02.200 --> 20:05.090
Who made you general?
The general, okay?

20:10.040 --> 20:12.441
Private Cleanup.
You don't touch anything.

20:14.120 --> 20:15.963
Ugh.

20:35.520 --> 20:37.249
Nina!

20:42.560 --> 20:44.324
Ariadni. Ah!

20:44.760 --> 20:47.240
You gotta do better than that.
No, no, no.

20:53.160 --> 20:55.970
I got you. Oh. Oh! Oh!

20:56.120 --> 20:58.646
Oh, where's my team?
Where's my team?

21:31.040 --> 21:32.724
The red ones.

21:39.760 --> 21:42.411
Okay. Pepper.

21:44.440 --> 21:47.603
Uh, I read both. The first one is
<i>That Time</i>, second is <i>This Time.</i>

21:47.800 --> 21:49.848
First is <i>This Time,</i>
second is <i>That Time</i>.

21:50.040 --> 21:53.601
We've got a joke in our family
that <i>This</i> brought us back together

21:53.760 --> 21:56.001
- and <i>That</i> paid for our apartment.
- Okay.

21:56.160 --> 22:00.210
It must be a little weird for Celine,
the way she's in the book like that.

22:00.400 --> 22:02.050
Why? She's gotten used to it.

22:02.240 --> 22:06.165
Second one is sexy. He misses
the plane, they black out the windows

22:06.320 --> 22:10.882
and they have sex for days and days
and days like there's no tomorrow, whoa.

22:11.080 --> 22:13.447
Did you guys actually do that?

22:14.160 --> 22:16.640
- You did that, huh?
- You read Jesse's third book?

22:16.800 --> 22:18.723
It's better than the first two.

22:18.920 --> 22:21.685
Took longer to write
than the first two put together.

22:21.880 --> 22:25.726
Third one I didn't read. My wife gave
it to me, but it's too long for me.

22:25.920 --> 22:27.843
The title is long. What's the title?

22:28.000 --> 22:31.686
<i>Temporary Cast Members of a Long
Running But Lime Seen Production</i>

22:31.840 --> 22:35.561
<i>of a Play Called Fleeting.</i>
Well, exactly, my point.

22:35.760 --> 22:37.762
Everybody else thought
it was too long.

22:37.960 --> 22:40.884
Well, it's a better book.
It's so much more ambitious.

22:44.720 --> 22:46.131
What's that?

22:46.320 --> 22:50.006
No, he says he likes all the books.

22:50.200 --> 22:52.123
He does. Huh?

22:52.280 --> 22:54.009
Well...
Ha, ha.

22:54.200 --> 22:56.362
I love it here.
This place is amazing.

22:56.600 --> 22:58.887
Those tomatoes are so amazing.
I can...

22:59.680 --> 23:01.284
I can smell them.

23:01.480 --> 23:03.164
It smells so good.

23:03.400 --> 23:06.131
Yeah, Patrick
is very proud of them.

23:06.360 --> 23:09.489
I know it's stupid, but when
we were about to leave Paris,

23:09.680 --> 23:13.571
I was nervous to come here. Now we're
about to leave, I don't wanna go.

23:13.760 --> 23:16.161
- Why were you nervous?
- Yeah, why was that?

23:16.360 --> 23:20.251
This place, it's so full of thousands
of years of myth and tragedy.

23:20.400 --> 23:22.209
Thought something
was gonna happen.

23:22.360 --> 23:25.330
You thought the minotaur
was going to eat your children?

23:25.520 --> 23:28.330
Yes. Exactly.

23:31.200 --> 23:33.680
Well, I've been working
on this idea

23:33.880 --> 23:37.168
about a group of people
with all these brain abnormalities.

23:37.360 --> 23:42.321
So the book would be like a day in their
life from all their unique points of view.

23:42.520 --> 23:45.364
This older lady has a condition
that makes you feel

23:45.520 --> 23:47.488
like you're in a state of dÃ©jÃ  vu.

23:47.640 --> 23:50.928
Every single experience she has
feels like she's had it before.

23:51.080 --> 23:54.050
She could be sitting here,
seemingly functional.

23:54.280 --> 23:57.443
In her head, she's thinking,
"Didn't he already say that?"

23:57.640 --> 24:01.201
"Weren't we were here yesterday
having this exact same conversation?"

24:01.400 --> 24:03.243
Like dÃ©jÃ  vu.
Except all the time.

24:03.440 --> 24:06.410
That's the thing, right?
Everything she takes in.

24:06.600 --> 24:10.764
Uh, breakfast, a newspaper, a movie. She's
convinced she's encountered it already.

24:10.960 --> 24:15.363
That's a real condition?
Yeah, it's called, um, persistent dÃ©jÃ ...

24:15.560 --> 24:17.483
It's real, but I can't pronounce it.
Ha-ha-ha.

24:17.680 --> 24:21.810
Then there's these two other characters
with facial recognition extremes.

24:22.000 --> 24:26.369
There's this one guy and he can't
recognize his wife of 20 years.

24:26.560 --> 24:30.042
He looks at himself in the mirror,
and he feels this disconnect

24:30.280 --> 24:32.009
with that man he's looking at.

24:32.240 --> 24:35.767
Then the other character is the opposite.
A middle-aged housewife

24:35.960 --> 24:38.930
with exacting memory of every face
she's ever seen.

24:39.160 --> 24:42.004
She lives in a big city,
but to her, it's a small town.

24:42.200 --> 24:46.524
Like, a taxi drives past and she thinks:
"Oh, that's the driver who dropped me off

24:46.680 --> 24:48.842
at Place des Vosges
three Christmases ago."

24:49.000 --> 24:51.401
Like some old lady
walking on the street, she thinks:

24:52.760 --> 24:55.206
"She sat two seats down from me
on the Metro last year."

24:55.360 --> 24:59.331
So everyone she meets, you know,
to her, feels intimate and connected.

24:59.560 --> 25:00.766
I'm like the first guy.

25:00.960 --> 25:04.123
Like I feel connected to nothing
most of the time, man.

25:04.320 --> 25:06.971
Oh, Achilleas, Anna.
Hey, you guys.

25:08.840 --> 25:10.046
Hey, look at this kid.

25:10.240 --> 25:12.447
He's having the best summer
of us all.

25:20.200 --> 25:23.124
So you were saying
there's three characters, right?

25:23.320 --> 25:25.641
Not just three.
It's a whole group of people.

25:25.840 --> 25:29.447
I'm working on a chapter about a
young Greek man named Achilleas.

25:29.600 --> 25:31.523
- Me?
- Well, he's named after you.

25:31.720 --> 25:36.248
The guy is caught in a loop. All he sees
is the transient nature of everything.

25:36.440 --> 25:40.490
He looks out at the sea, thinks it's gonna
be dry and littered with fossils.

25:40.680 --> 25:42.330
Well, I don't know.

25:42.560 --> 25:44.164
What?
Sounds pretentious.

25:44.360 --> 25:46.931
It won't be pretentious.
It's gonna be funny.

25:47.120 --> 25:49.282
Really funny.
Like, he picks up a book

25:49.480 --> 25:52.882
and he wonders, "Who's gonna be
the last person to read this?"

25:53.080 --> 25:56.687
And that's funny? Ha-ha-ha.
Sometimes I kind of think like that.

25:56.840 --> 26:00.401
Okay. So he doesn't get excited
about tits, cars, booze? Nothing.

26:00.600 --> 26:02.011
He just thinks about death.

26:02.240 --> 26:05.483
Well, not so much death, right?
It's just like transformation.

26:05.680 --> 26:08.729
Like he's seeing too far into the future.
Okay.

26:08.960 --> 26:10.962
I like this idea for a novel.

26:11.160 --> 26:15.802
Add a character of an old man who can't
remember what he had for breakfast,

26:16.000 --> 26:20.050
but can still hear the song playing
when Sheila Campbell danced topless

26:20.200 --> 26:22.851
on the bar at Jury's
when he was 14 years old.

26:23.040 --> 26:24.610
- That'd work.
- Okay,

26:24.800 --> 26:28.202
you have these people lost in time.
But what's the connection?

26:28.360 --> 26:30.727
Are they gonna have sex?
Don't you need that?

26:30.880 --> 26:34.282
It's not time they're lost in.
It's perception. That's the deal.

26:34.440 --> 26:37.762
No, I'm thinking of setting
the whole novel at a movie.

26:37.960 --> 26:41.965
Like every character comes in contact
with the film <i>On the Waterfront.</i>

26:42.200 --> 26:44.200
Have you seen <i>On the Waterfront?
On the Waterfront?</i>

26:45.480 --> 26:46.920
- Oh, with Brando? Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

26:47.080 --> 26:51.483
Yeah, yeah. Okay, the first chapter is
opening weekend, Times Square, 1954.

26:51.680 --> 26:56.607
That old lady with perpetual deja vu
walks into the matinÃ©e screening, right?

26:56.840 --> 27:01.323
Except the whole time she's thinking,
"Haven't I already seen this?"

27:01.520 --> 27:04.205
Yeah.
Another chapter is a 1979

27:04.400 --> 27:05.925
Paris film studies class.

27:06.120 --> 27:11.524
Then we have, uh, a Kazan retrospective
in Munich, 1993.

27:11.720 --> 27:18.046
That is time. How is that not time?
Yeah, it's time. But it's more perception.

27:18.440 --> 27:21.171
You don't like it?
I think it's gonna be too long. Ha-ha-ha.

27:21.360 --> 27:23.249
Well, I like it.

27:23.440 --> 27:26.967
Don't listen to him. He makes bicycles.
Send it to me in galleys.

27:27.640 --> 27:28.687
Will do.

27:31.560 --> 27:33.722
Watch out.

27:39.640 --> 27:43.201
In France, we stuff tomatoes
with tomatoes and peppers with peppers.

27:43.360 --> 27:48.287
We use the same for both because of the way
it reacts differently in terms of taste.

27:48.520 --> 27:49.760
Okay.

27:51.960 --> 27:54.645
Celine, make sure you
don't stuff them too much

27:54.840 --> 27:57.411
because of the way
it overflows in the oven.

27:57.600 --> 27:58.965
Okay.
Gets nasty.

27:59.120 --> 28:00.406
You're doing fine, Celine.

28:00.640 --> 28:03.325
And, especially,
don't listen to Stefanos.

28:04.240 --> 28:08.040
Because he's never made this dish
before or any other dish for that matter.

28:10.280 --> 28:11.441
You know? I mean...

28:12.800 --> 28:14.086
Let go.

28:14.240 --> 28:16.322
Let go of me! Let go.

28:19.200 --> 28:20.690
You guys are fighting.
Ha-ha-ha.

28:20.920 --> 28:21.967
With knives?

28:22.120 --> 28:24.646
Okay, stop it.
Stop fighting with knives.

28:24.840 --> 28:27.969
We're not fighting. We're negotiating.
Yeah.

28:28.120 --> 28:30.043
Negotiating. That's how you call it?

28:30.240 --> 28:31.321
Wow.

28:35.920 --> 28:37.365
It's a system that we have.

28:37.560 --> 28:39.608
Wow. You found a system
that works for you.

28:39.760 --> 28:42.889
I thought it was a relationship.
I like system. That's good.

28:43.040 --> 28:44.963
Not too many, right?
Not too many.

28:52.560 --> 28:55.166
We used to have that system.
Ha-ha-ha.

29:08.720 --> 29:10.688
Not too far, you guys!

29:49.000 --> 29:52.721
I don't wanna let this meal go by
without saying thank you to everyone.

29:52.920 --> 29:54.604
And especially you, Patrick.

29:54.800 --> 29:58.043
We had no idea what we were getting
into these last six weeks.

29:58.240 --> 30:00.288
A letter arrives from the university

30:00.520 --> 30:03.444
inviting us to the southern
Peloponnese of Greece

30:03.640 --> 30:05.768
to the guest house of a great writer?

30:05.960 --> 30:08.201
- Sure, why not?
Ha-ha-ha.

30:08.760 --> 30:11.809
And then at the airport
earlier today,

30:12.000 --> 30:15.322
Hank says this has been
the greatest summer of his life.

30:15.520 --> 30:17.841
That's nice.
And I have to say the same.

30:18.080 --> 30:21.926
Thank you, Patrick. Not just for what
you've done for me and my family,

30:22.120 --> 30:25.203
but for all the ways you're
giving back. To Patrick.

30:30.520 --> 30:34.889
Thank you, thank you. When I first
saw you at the airport, I thought:

30:35.080 --> 30:38.323
"No way a man dressed like that
could be a man of letters."

30:42.600 --> 30:45.683
But now, now I think
I've learned your secret.

30:46.240 --> 30:48.766
We've had many great writers here
over the past decade.

30:48.920 --> 30:52.481
But never one who had a partner
more interesting than themselves.

30:52.640 --> 30:53.687
Oh.

30:55.880 --> 30:57.484
I keep telling you. Ha-ha-ha.

30:57.640 --> 31:00.962
And Celine,
it's been so great to have you

31:01.160 --> 31:04.004
and your daughters'
wonderful vitality around here.

31:04.200 --> 31:08.410
And I'm so happy that you were able
to meet my dear friend, Natalia.

31:08.600 --> 31:11.285
Whose husband Elias
was like a brother to me.

31:11.960 --> 31:14.964
- Sorry about the curtains.
- Shouldn't have given cherries.

31:15.160 --> 31:17.447
It was my fault.
So beautiful.

31:17.680 --> 31:20.160
Thanks for including Anna
and me this summer.

31:20.360 --> 31:21.930
He usually puts me to work.

31:22.120 --> 31:25.681
But when I bring Anna, he lets me
sit at the table of the grown-ups.

31:25.880 --> 31:28.326
Hey, welcome to
the grown-ups table.

31:31.240 --> 31:34.244
How long have you two been together?
Since last summer.

31:34.440 --> 31:37.489
We met one year ago in
my last few days here with Grandpa.

31:37.680 --> 31:40.843
Before I had to go back to Athens.
We met at my cast party.

31:41.040 --> 31:43.930
I was doing Shakespeare
at Epidavros. Yup.

31:44.120 --> 31:47.124
So who did you play?
I was Perdita in Winter's Tale.

31:47.320 --> 31:48.606
And she was fantastic.

31:48.840 --> 31:51.923
Remember, Patrick, we went to that?
Ah, Perdita.

31:52.080 --> 31:54.890
"When you do dance,
I wish you a wave o' the sea

31:55.080 --> 31:56.923
that you might ever do nothing
but that."

31:58.840 --> 32:02.731
The way he just performed that
was better than the guy at the play.

32:02.920 --> 32:04.843
People are still talking about that.

32:05.040 --> 32:07.805
The after-party was even better.
It's where we met.

32:08.000 --> 32:11.322
Yeah. I had an old BSA motorcycle.

32:11.880 --> 32:14.850
- Nice.
- We drove around all night.

32:15.040 --> 32:18.522
And then I had to drive her back
to the theater to get her stuff.

32:18.720 --> 32:20.882
And it was dawn.
I'll never forget it.

32:21.120 --> 32:25.409
It's outdoors and seats 12,000 people,
but it was now completely empty.

32:26.160 --> 32:28.811
And she was sitting
way up in the back row.

32:29.000 --> 32:34.040
So I went up on stage
and whispered to her...

32:34.240 --> 32:37.403
Acoustics there are incredible.
I could see his mouth move

32:37.640 --> 32:41.122
and then three seconds later,
I could hear his voice in my ear.

32:41.280 --> 32:42.850
What did he say?

32:45.040 --> 32:47.361
Oh! Okay.
Private. Private.

32:47.560 --> 32:50.928
And then she had to fly back to Paris
a couple of days later.

32:51.080 --> 32:54.766
How did you keep in touch?
We Skyped every day since then.

32:54.960 --> 32:59.329
When we're apart, we have a thing
of putting our laptop by the pillow

32:59.520 --> 33:01.170
and fall asleep together.

33:01.320 --> 33:03.368
- Oh, that's the new romance.
Heh-heh-heh.

33:03.560 --> 33:06.325
And when I wake up,
the screen is usually frozen.

33:06.520 --> 33:10.605
And Anna's face
is in some funny position, like:

33:12.160 --> 33:14.049
Let me ask...
Can I ask a question?

33:14.240 --> 33:15.287
- Please?
- Yeah.

33:15.480 --> 33:18.131
When you guys Skype,
do you, you know...?

33:18.320 --> 33:21.608
Do you go a little crazy?
Oh, God, you're being so vulgar.

33:21.800 --> 33:24.087
I'm just being
an amateur anthropologist

33:24.280 --> 33:27.124
interested in virtual worlds
on a theoretical level.

33:27.320 --> 33:29.561
So now you're an anthropologist?
Yeah.

33:29.760 --> 33:33.401
For instance, the sex of the near
future, I'm not making this up,

33:33.600 --> 33:38.049
but is gonna be just like plugging in,
attaching something to your genitals,

33:38.280 --> 33:42.171
and you'll be having virtual intercourse
with anyone of your choice.

33:42.360 --> 33:45.170
You'll be able to program in
all your preferences.

33:45.360 --> 33:50.127
You'll be able to type in what you want
Marilyn Monroe to whisper in your ear.

33:50.280 --> 33:51.805
I might like that.

33:51.960 --> 33:53.485
All right. Come on.
Yes.

33:54.080 --> 33:56.082
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
Here, here.

33:56.280 --> 33:59.523
I mean, why not?
More and more of our experiences

33:59.720 --> 34:02.963
are going to take place
in the virtual world, you know?

34:03.120 --> 34:07.045
You're a writer. How are you gonna
feel when a computer can write a book

34:07.200 --> 34:09.885
better than <i>War and Peace?</i>
It'll never happen.

34:10.040 --> 34:13.010
It's only a question about
when it's going to happen.

34:13.199 --> 34:17.250
I think I'm gonna feel about it the same
way Kasparov felt when they could

34:17.400 --> 34:20.449
no longer compete with that computer.
Big Blue.

34:20.600 --> 34:23.364
Right. Nobody thought a computer
could beat our best.

34:23.520 --> 34:27.127
"A machine lacks
that ineffable human instinct."

34:27.320 --> 34:30.244
And then... You know,
and now we can't even compete.

34:30.440 --> 34:34.081
I saw a documentary where they were
doing an experiment on a lab rat.

34:34.280 --> 34:35.770
And he was wired up

34:35.960 --> 34:38.929
and he could push a switch
and have an orgasm.

34:39.120 --> 34:43.569
And so the scientists were sort of
laughing at this pathetic little creature

34:43.760 --> 34:47.810
while it ignored his food and water
and didn't do anything else.

34:48.000 --> 34:49.684
And eventually it just died.

34:49.880 --> 34:52.246
I mean,
I think that's the future of humanity.

34:52.480 --> 34:55.051
You know, just: ALL: Ha-ha-ha.

34:55.280 --> 34:57.123
And die.

34:57.360 --> 34:59.408
Well, well, maybe so,

34:59.600 --> 35:04.686
but every generation believes that
they're witnessing the end of the world,

35:05.080 --> 35:07.526
but I feel
that I'm actually living it.

35:07.720 --> 35:12.248
Okay, I have a question for you, Patrick. I
think a lot of people are feeling that way.

35:12.440 --> 35:15.842
That we're this kind of
pleasure-obsessed, porn-addled,

35:16.040 --> 35:19.328
materialists,
ceding our humanity to technology

35:19.520 --> 35:22.649
at the same moment that
computers are becoming sentient.

35:22.840 --> 35:26.322
So, what my question is,
is this notion of self to begin with.

35:26.560 --> 35:30.360
Well, it's written over the portals
to the temple of Apollo at Delphi.

35:30.600 --> 35:34.605
It says, <i>"gnothi seauton"</i>,
which means "Know thyself."

35:34.800 --> 35:37.280
But we're kind of 99 percent
automated already.

35:37.480 --> 35:40.563
No. Our personality
or this thing we think of as ourself

35:40.720 --> 35:43.326
is a tiny fraction
of what the brain is doing.

35:43.480 --> 35:46.802
Most of it is automated body functions.
What is it we're ceding?

35:47.040 --> 35:50.886
No, if this notion of self is such a
small percentage of you, sweetie,

35:51.120 --> 35:53.407
how come I always hear
so much about it?

35:53.600 --> 35:57.571
Well, just like my penis. It's not that big.
It's a small part of myself,

35:57.800 --> 36:00.724
but it needs a lot of attention.
His too.

36:00.880 --> 36:03.281
Ha-ha-ha.
And how did you two meet?

36:03.480 --> 36:05.005
- You don't know?
- What?

36:05.200 --> 36:06.884
You have to read Jesse's books.

36:07.080 --> 36:10.482
If you wanna know what it's like
to have sex with me, read away.

36:10.640 --> 36:13.644
Read away.
Oh, excuse me, Stefanos.

36:13.840 --> 36:15.968
- No, no. I mean it's well-written.
Ha-ha-ha.

36:16.160 --> 36:18.527
Yeah.
Thank you. We met about 18 years ago.

36:18.720 --> 36:22.122
We kind of, sort of fell in love
a little bit, and then we...

36:22.360 --> 36:26.888
A bit. Then we lost track of each other.
A decade later, we ran into each other.

36:27.120 --> 36:29.407
We didn't run into each other.
We didn't?

36:29.600 --> 36:32.285
No. You wrote a book "inspired"
by our meeting.

36:32.480 --> 36:35.529
Yeah.
I read about it and went to look for him.

36:35.720 --> 36:37.210
- Pretty romantic.
- It was.

36:37.400 --> 36:40.051
Not really. Not really.
He neglects to mention

36:40.240 --> 36:42.402
he was married, had a kid...
Details.

36:42.600 --> 36:44.170
That part was a disaster.

36:44.360 --> 36:46.408
It wasn't. It was inevitable.
Yeah.

36:46.640 --> 36:49.291
The first time we have sex
without a condom, twins.

36:49.440 --> 36:52.842
I've been chained to the sink ever since.
One pitch, two-run homer. Boom.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.526
It's not that bad.
The girls are so beautiful.

36:55.720 --> 36:58.451
- They're cute.
Ha-ha-ha.

36:58.600 --> 37:01.365
Okay. No, no.
It has some upsides, okay.

37:01.560 --> 37:04.245
Let me tell you right now, Anna,
how to keep a man.

37:04.440 --> 37:05.646
You gotta let them win

37:05.800 --> 37:08.531
at all the silly little games they like.
Oh, okay.

37:08.720 --> 37:11.724
When I met Jesse, we were playing
pinball. I was winning.

37:11.880 --> 37:14.121
The foundational lie
to our relationship.

37:14.320 --> 37:17.290
I let the ball go down the middle.
She can't beat me.

37:17.440 --> 37:18.885
It builds their confidence.

37:19.040 --> 37:23.011
If I didn't let him win at every game,
we would never have sex.

37:23.200 --> 37:27.205
I mean, I'm sorry to say it,
but he's actually a closet macho.

37:27.400 --> 37:29.448
He dreams of having a bimbo
for a wife.

37:29.680 --> 37:33.480
It's my greatest aspiration, a bimbo.
Dreams.

37:35.080 --> 37:36.161
Whoa.

37:36.840 --> 37:39.047
So...
Uh-oh.

37:40.000 --> 37:41.968
- Yes.
Ha-ha-ha.

37:42.120 --> 37:44.282
So you're a writer?

37:46.080 --> 37:47.684
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

37:47.880 --> 37:50.770
So you write, like, books?

37:53.200 --> 37:55.441
I've written a few, sure.
Sure, yeah.

37:55.600 --> 37:59.207
Wow.
I've never met a writer before.

37:59.400 --> 38:03.086
No?
You must be really smart.

38:03.240 --> 38:07.131
You know, I can't even write my own
name sometimes when I'm tired.

38:07.280 --> 38:10.124
Aw. What kind of books
do you like, huh?

38:10.680 --> 38:13.604
Well, I like stories
with a meaning behind it.

38:13.800 --> 38:16.724
Like a really beautiful love story.
Oh, sure, yeah.

38:16.920 --> 38:20.891
You know, I read this book once,
uh, <i>Romeo and...</i>

38:21.040 --> 38:22.371
<i>Juliet.</i>

38:23.000 --> 38:24.684
Right?
Yeah.

38:24.840 --> 38:26.126
Oh, yeah.
Wow. You know it.

38:26.320 --> 38:29.961
It's very good. It's a play, actually.
It's not a book, a play.

38:30.200 --> 38:32.407
I thought it was a book
based on the movie.

38:32.560 --> 38:34.642
Ha-ha-ha.
No. No, a play. Yeah.

38:34.840 --> 38:37.525
- Okay, it was a play. Wow.
Ha-ha-ha.

38:37.680 --> 38:40.650
Well, I didn't read the whole thing
because sometimes

38:40.800 --> 38:43.326
I have to keep up
and read those magazines

38:43.520 --> 38:46.205
to know what's going on
in those people's lives.

38:46.400 --> 38:49.768
Well, that is important.
Okay, well, you're very, very smart.

38:49.960 --> 38:54.329
And I bet you have a gigantic penis.

38:54.560 --> 38:58.929
Why am I finding myself
so attracted to this woman?

38:59.120 --> 39:02.488
For real! And
that's the funny part of it.

39:02.680 --> 39:06.321
The not-so-funny part
of the closet macho, okay,

39:06.520 --> 39:10.844
is today, after we dropped Henry off,
he tells me even though I have an offer

39:11.000 --> 39:13.844
for an amazing job,
he wants me to move to Chicago.

39:14.000 --> 39:19.370
That's not what I said. I missed him.
So we can babysit for his ex-wife.

39:19.520 --> 39:21.488
- I thought I was in a...
- Hey, stop it.

39:21.640 --> 39:24.041
It must have been hard
saying goodbye to Hank.

39:24.240 --> 39:26.607
- Yeah, of course.
- He's such an amazing kid.

39:26.840 --> 39:29.889
Tell him I miss my chess partner.
I will.

39:30.040 --> 39:33.283
When Stefanos and I split up,
I'm getting full custody.

39:33.440 --> 39:35.647
Oh. That's okay for a while

39:35.840 --> 39:38.969
because me and my 20-year-old girlfriend
will be a little bit preoccupied.

39:40.320 --> 39:42.322
- I love men.
- And I love you.

39:42.560 --> 39:43.561
Aw...

39:46.360 --> 39:49.648
Okay, I have a story
that my husband here loves.

39:49.840 --> 39:53.970
Gonna tell you everything you need
to know about masculine and feminine.

39:54.200 --> 39:55.247
Okay.
Okay, ready?

39:55.440 --> 39:58.125
Yeah.
My mom used to be a nurse,

39:58.320 --> 40:01.767
so she was there when people
were coming out of their coma.

40:01.960 --> 40:03.689
Oh, that story. I'm listening.
Listen.

40:03.920 --> 40:06.287
It's an interesting story.
I'm listening.

40:06.480 --> 40:09.450
So she was the one to tell them:

40:09.640 --> 40:14.089
"Hi. My name's Katerina.
You're coming out of a coma."

40:15.480 --> 40:18.882
"You've been in a really bad
automobile accident,

40:19.080 --> 40:21.401
but you're gonna be okay."

40:22.000 --> 40:24.606
"You're gonna be fine."
You know, stuff like that.

40:24.800 --> 40:28.361
She said that every woman,
the very first thing,

40:28.560 --> 40:32.531
the first reaction she would have,
would be to ask about everyone else.

40:32.680 --> 40:35.411
"How are my kids?
How's my husband?"

40:36.000 --> 40:37.525
"Is anyone else hurt?"

40:37.720 --> 40:43.090
Every man, with no exception,
when they were told this,

40:43.280 --> 40:46.045
what was the first thing they did?

40:46.240 --> 40:47.480
Look down at their cock.

40:49.800 --> 40:52.610
You know what? You gotta
make sure it's still there.

40:52.840 --> 40:54.888
You gotta make sure
it's still working.

40:55.080 --> 40:57.048
Alive and kicking.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

40:57.240 --> 41:02.087
And only eventually they'd come
around to asking about their kids

41:02.280 --> 41:05.409
or about someone else
they might've accidentally killed.

41:05.600 --> 41:06.681
Stuff like that.

41:06.880 --> 41:10.282
Doesn't that say it all? Penis
first, then the rest of the world.

41:10.480 --> 41:12.041
<i>Penis, penis, penis...</i>

41:12.240 --> 41:13.730
Okay, okay. Whoa, whoa.

41:13.920 --> 41:16.924
But if you can explain it all
on strictly gender terms,

41:17.160 --> 41:20.642
why do you, or why does any
woman, waste time getting mad at

41:20.840 --> 41:25.050
or bother trying to change a man?
If it's all biology, what is the problem?

41:25.240 --> 41:27.720
And you're so good
at turning things around.

41:27.960 --> 41:31.681
No, I mean, like, he's a genius.
It's like getting pissed at a frog

41:31.880 --> 41:34.042
for being green.
Yes. Exactly.

41:34.240 --> 41:38.768
Hearing all this, I wonder if this idea
of love affair that lasts forever

41:38.960 --> 41:40.405
is still relevant to us.

41:40.640 --> 41:44.122
I mean, we know that we are going
to break up eventually.

41:44.320 --> 41:46.926
Definitely.
Are your parents still together?

41:47.120 --> 41:48.849
- No way.
- No? And what about you?

41:49.040 --> 41:51.930
- They are. But they could be divorced.
- They could be.

41:52.080 --> 41:55.607
I think if they had more money,
they wouldn't still be together.

41:55.800 --> 42:00.328
God, you guys are so practical.
I was born into the wrong generation.

42:00.520 --> 42:03.842
My grandmother's mother
wrote to our whole family

42:04.080 --> 42:06.970
a 26-page letter from her deathbed.

42:07.160 --> 42:10.642
And she spent three pages
on the costumes she did for a play

42:10.880 --> 42:13.963
and one paragraph on her husband.
She an actress too?

42:14.160 --> 42:16.527
No, she was a, um...
She was a...

42:18.200 --> 42:21.170
- Seamstress. A seamstress.
- Seamstress.

42:21.360 --> 42:23.647
And she had
all these wonderful friends.

42:23.840 --> 42:27.811
And about my great-grandfather,
she mentioned three events.

42:28.000 --> 42:31.447
He went to the war, we moved
because of his job, and he died.

42:33.880 --> 42:37.680
Her big advice was to not to be
too consumed with romantic love.

42:37.880 --> 42:41.930
Friendships and work, she said,
brought her the most happiness.

42:42.120 --> 42:43.565
I couldn't agree more.

42:43.760 --> 42:46.127
I mean,
that's the thing that fucks us up.

42:46.320 --> 42:50.564
This idea of a soul mate, of someone
who will come to complete us

42:50.760 --> 42:54.128
and save us from
having to take care of ourselves.

42:54.320 --> 42:56.641
With Stefanos,
I set the bar extremely low.

42:58.040 --> 43:00.008
I know he's not gonna meet
any of my needs.

43:00.200 --> 43:01.531
Definitely not.

43:01.760 --> 43:03.728
What about Grandma?
Was she soul mate?

43:03.920 --> 43:08.209
Well, sounds appealing, but actually your
grandmother was more rational than that.

43:08.400 --> 43:11.210
She took care of herself
and asked me to do the same.

43:11.440 --> 43:13.727
We had plenty of room
to meet in the middle.

43:13.920 --> 43:16.810
Yeah. That sounds ideal.
That is, actually. it is.

43:17.000 --> 43:19.571
But it must be obvious
my wife is not here today.

43:19.760 --> 43:23.560
We were never one person. Always two.
We preferred it that way.

43:24.120 --> 43:26.088
That's so beautiful.

43:26.280 --> 43:30.365
I think my husband is always trying
to almost colonize me, you know?

43:31.040 --> 43:32.690
I colonize you?

43:34.000 --> 43:38.005
Yes, but I colonize you too, darling.
Oh. Okay.

43:38.200 --> 43:39.804
But at the end of the day,

43:40.320 --> 43:44.609
it's not the love of one other person
that matters, it's the love of life.

43:44.800 --> 43:47.531
That's good to know,
because life, I can handle.

43:47.720 --> 43:51.520
Ariadni, on the other hand. we all
know the Greeks invented tragedy.

43:51.720 --> 43:54.451
And on top of that,
she's from the region of Mani,

43:54.640 --> 43:56.563
which is short for maniac.

43:59.600 --> 44:01.921
Ask them about the hotel.

44:02.960 --> 44:07.727
If we can't make that hotel room tonight,
could you get a refund or use it yourself?

44:07.920 --> 44:11.527
No, we don't get a refund, man.
Are you trying to get out of it?

44:11.720 --> 44:14.769
It's such a great gift,
but I'm so stressed

44:15.000 --> 44:17.128
- getting all the packing ready...
- No.

44:17.320 --> 44:20.563
We made a deal, guys. We watch the kids.
You're gonna love it.

44:20.760 --> 44:22.808
We're gonna watch yours.
Really good.

44:23.000 --> 44:26.607
It's a fantastic walk to the hotel.
And you want to grab it.

44:26.800 --> 44:29.087
And we'll be very offended
if you don't go.

44:29.280 --> 44:31.123
Okay. Thank you.

44:31.280 --> 44:33.203
Mm.
You're going.

44:34.000 --> 44:35.968
Well, when I think of Elias,

44:36.160 --> 44:38.925
what I miss the most about him

44:39.120 --> 44:42.408
is the way he used to lie down
next to me at night.

44:42.600 --> 44:46.650
Sometimes his arm would stretch
along my chest.

44:46.840 --> 44:52.131
And I couldn't move.
I even held my breath.

44:52.320 --> 44:54.402
But I felt safe.

44:55.440 --> 44:57.249
Complete.

44:58.080 --> 45:02.768
And I miss the way he was whistling
walking down the street.

45:02.960 --> 45:06.169
And every time I do something,
I think of what he would say:

45:06.360 --> 45:09.682
"It's cold today. Wear a scarf." Heh.

45:10.080 --> 45:16.087
But lately,
I've been forgetting little things.

45:16.280 --> 45:21.207
He's sort of fading
and I'm starting to forget him,

45:21.440 --> 45:26.446
and it's like losing him again.

45:26.640 --> 45:32.522
So sometimes, I make myself
remember every detail of his face.

45:32.720 --> 45:37.009
The exact color of his eyes,
his lips, his teeth,

45:37.200 --> 45:40.602
the texture of his skin, his hair.

45:41.360 --> 45:44.569
That was all gone by the time he went.

45:45.320 --> 45:46.845
And sometimes... Not always.

45:47.000 --> 45:48.650
But sometimes

45:48.840 --> 45:50.968
I can actually see him.

45:51.160 --> 45:53.970
It's as if a cloud moves away
and there he is.

45:54.160 --> 45:55.650
I could almost touch him.

45:55.840 --> 46:02.041
But then the real world rushes in,
and he vanishes again.

46:03.000 --> 46:05.480
For a while,
I did this every morning

46:05.680 --> 46:07.967
when the sun
was not too bright outside.

46:08.200 --> 46:11.886
The sun somehow makes him vanish.

46:12.480 --> 46:19.011
Yes, he appears and he disappears,
like a sunrise or sunset.

46:19.200 --> 46:22.443
Anything so ephemeral.

46:23.400 --> 46:26.324
Eh, just like our life. Hm?

46:26.520 --> 46:30.206
We appear and we disappear.

46:30.400 --> 46:33.609
And we are so important to some,

46:33.920 --> 46:38.448
but we are just passing through.

46:41.600 --> 46:44.604
To passing through.
To passing through.

46:44.800 --> 46:47.201
- To passing through.
- To passing through.

46:56.160 --> 46:59.607
And eventually he catches his
face in the window's reflection.

46:59.800 --> 47:02.280
He realizes he's no longer
a 9-year-old boy.

47:02.480 --> 47:05.484
He's suddenly old. He's got
a beard, his eyes are watery.

47:05.680 --> 47:09.321
This one seems sad. I thought you
were gonna tell me about the guy

47:09.520 --> 47:11.887
that has an imaginary friend.
Which one?

47:12.080 --> 47:13.241
When he's in his 50's,

47:13.440 --> 47:15.920
imaginary friend shows up again.
Hummingbird?

47:16.120 --> 47:18.805
That one. It's funny.
Yeah. You like that one? Oh.

47:19.000 --> 47:21.731
Remember that letter
that you let me read

47:21.920 --> 47:24.685
that you wrote when you were 20
to yourself at 40?

47:24.880 --> 47:28.327
I remember."Dear 40-year-old
Jesse, I hope you're not divorced."

47:28.520 --> 47:32.366
I didn't remember that part. I meant
all the other things in that letter.

47:32.560 --> 47:33.641
You're the same guy.

47:33.840 --> 47:37.401
We always think we're evolving,
but we can't change that much.

47:37.560 --> 47:40.040
Know how I think I've changed the most?
How?

47:40.200 --> 47:42.885
When I was younger,
I just wanted time to speed up.

47:43.040 --> 47:44.849
Why?
So I could be on my own,

47:45.040 --> 47:47.646
be freed from parents, school,
all that shit.

47:47.880 --> 47:51.009
I just wanted to close my eyes
and wake up and be an adult.

47:51.200 --> 47:54.204
Now I feel that happened, and I
just want everything to slow down.

47:54.360 --> 47:58.285
Mm. I've always had this feeling
no matter where I am in my life

47:58.520 --> 48:02.161
that it's either a memory or a dream.
You've always thought that.

48:02.400 --> 48:06.564
Me too. Like, is this really my life?
Like, is it happening right now?

48:06.760 --> 48:08.524
It is. Ha-ha-ha.
I know. Heh, heh.

48:08.720 --> 48:12.281
Every year, I seem to get a bit
more humbled and more overwhelmed

48:12.480 --> 48:15.165
about things I'm never gonna
know or understand.

48:15.360 --> 48:18.807
I keep telling you, you know nothing.
I know. I'm coming around.

48:19.040 --> 48:20.724
But not knowing is not so bad.

48:20.880 --> 48:26.091
I mean, the point is to be looking,
searching, to stay hungry, right?

48:26.280 --> 48:28.851
It's true.
I just wish it was a little easier.

48:29.040 --> 48:30.326
How do you mean?

48:30.520 --> 48:33.410
Just to maintain a certain level
of passion, you know?

48:33.600 --> 48:35.887
I mean,
it used to come so naturally.

48:36.080 --> 48:39.801
I remember when I was younger, me and
all my writer friends, we, like...

48:40.000 --> 48:43.482
It felt like we were doing something
important. This was our time.

48:43.680 --> 48:46.047
But you were all arrogant
little pricks.

48:46.200 --> 48:48.089
Heh. No. Well... All right, maybe.
Ha-ha-ha.

48:48.320 --> 48:51.802
I don't know. It grew out
of all this energy and this creativity

48:52.000 --> 48:54.002
or whatever ambitions people had.

48:54.240 --> 48:58.131
I think you gotta be a little deluded
to stay motivated.

48:58.320 --> 49:01.369
Young men have this thing
about comparing themselves.

49:01.560 --> 49:04.689
They have all these signposts
they judge themself by.

49:04.920 --> 49:07.207
You used to do that all the time.
Do what?

49:07.400 --> 49:09.880
It was like, uh,
"Rimbaud wrote this by 17."

49:10.040 --> 49:14.329
Oh, yeah, definitely. Balzac wrote a book
before breakfast, so what am I doing?

49:14.520 --> 49:17.524
Women don't think that way as much.
You don't think so?

49:17.760 --> 49:20.491
No. We have much less
to compare ourselves to maybe.

49:20.720 --> 49:25.089
Women who achieve anything, first time you
hear about them, they're in their 50s.

49:25.280 --> 49:28.443
It was so hard for them
to get any recognitions before then.

49:28.640 --> 49:31.849
They struggled for 30 years
or they raised kids

49:32.040 --> 49:35.886
and were stranded at home before they
could finally do what they want.

49:36.040 --> 49:40.125
Actually, you know, it's kind of freeing.
We don't have to spend our lives

49:40.280 --> 49:42.248
comparing ourselves
to Martin Luther King,

49:42.400 --> 49:43.890
Ha-ha-ha.
Gandhi, Tolstoy.

49:44.120 --> 49:45.690
What about Joan of Arc, right?

49:45.840 --> 49:48.889
I mean, she was a teenager,
and she saved France, so...

49:49.080 --> 49:51.447
Who wants to be Joan of Arc?
Forget France.

49:51.640 --> 49:54.007
She was burned at the stake
and a virgin, okay?

49:54.160 --> 49:56.401
Ha-ha-ha. Okay.
Nothing I aspire to.

49:56.600 --> 49:59.410
What a great achievement.
Ha-ha-ha.

50:00.920 --> 50:02.410
Oh, God.
What?

50:02.680 --> 50:03.841
No, nothing.

50:04.040 --> 50:07.408
What?
This is so weird. Ha, ha.

50:07.800 --> 50:09.882
What do you mean?
Just this.

50:10.080 --> 50:12.970
Us, walking,
having a conversation

50:13.160 --> 50:15.925
about something else
than scheduling, food, work.

50:16.120 --> 50:19.920
Yeah, how long's it been since we
just wandered around bullshitting?

50:20.760 --> 50:22.888
Do you hear what I hear?

50:23.480 --> 50:25.403
The sea?
No.

50:25.680 --> 50:28.763
What? Oh, no small feet.
Mm-hm.

50:28.960 --> 50:32.043
No... Nothing being knocked over,
nothing we have to clean up,

50:32.240 --> 50:34.049
no injustices being done.

50:34.240 --> 50:37.562
Yeah. So when was the last time?
Mm.

50:37.840 --> 50:40.810
When we had nowhere we had to be?
Yeah.

50:41.440 --> 50:43.727
Remember Luxembourg Gardens?
Yeah.

50:43.920 --> 50:46.764
Used to kick your ass at Ping-Pong?
Congratulations.

50:46.920 --> 50:48.843
You beat a woman pregnant
with twins.

50:49.000 --> 50:51.890
It's better than losing
to a pregnant woman with twins.

50:52.040 --> 50:54.407
Okay? Heh, heh.
Oh, God.

50:54.560 --> 50:55.925
You know what I think?

50:56.080 --> 51:00.051
From the time we leave our
parents' house until we have kids.

51:00.280 --> 51:03.124
That's the only time your life
is completely your own.

51:03.320 --> 51:05.607
I had about a decade of that.
It was great.

51:05.800 --> 51:08.007
It was just like one long flowing...

51:08.160 --> 51:10.049
A day, a week, a year.

51:10.240 --> 51:13.403
There wasn't much difference.
I used to keep track of time.

51:13.560 --> 51:17.565
Through jobs, boyfriends, stuff like that.
Now I can tell you every detail

51:17.760 --> 51:21.446
of the past seven years based on what
was happening in the girls' lives.

51:21.640 --> 51:22.641
Yeah, right. Totally.

51:22.800 --> 51:24.689
You do that too?

51:24.920 --> 51:27.685
Yeah. I mean, time's demarcated now.
Really?

51:27.840 --> 51:29.444
What?
No, no, no. No, I just...

51:29.640 --> 51:33.281
I'm surprised. I'm surprised you do that.
No, but... Okay, quick test.

51:33.520 --> 51:35.761
Oh, no.
You know, August, 2009.

51:35.920 --> 51:39.083
No, August... Come on. It's a quick one.
Why?

51:39.320 --> 51:41.243
What was happening?
August...

51:41.400 --> 51:43.402
We were on vacation
with your parents.

51:43.560 --> 51:46.643
Nina got the chicken pox first,
quickly followed by Ella.

51:46.840 --> 51:49.764
I'm so impressed.
So do I get a gold star?

51:50.000 --> 51:51.923
Maybe.
Mm-hm.

51:52.760 --> 51:55.366
Hey, can I ask you a question?
Sure.

51:55.560 --> 52:00.043
If we were meeting for the first time today
on a train, would you find me attractive?

52:00.240 --> 52:03.050
Of course.
No, but really, right now, as I am?

52:03.240 --> 52:05.481
Would you start talking to me?

52:05.720 --> 52:08.246
Would you ask me
to get off the train with you?

52:09.680 --> 52:12.650
Well, I mean, you're asking
a theoretical question.

52:12.840 --> 52:16.561
What would my life situation be?
Wouldn't I be cheating on you?

52:16.760 --> 52:18.603
Why can't you just say yes?
I did.

52:18.800 --> 52:21.770
I wanted you to say something
romantic and you blew it.

52:21.960 --> 52:24.930
Okay, all right, wait,
if I saw you on a train,

52:25.160 --> 52:27.686
I would lock eyes with you, walk up to you
Uh-huh.

52:27.840 --> 52:29.126
And say, "Hey, baby."

52:29.280 --> 52:32.204
"You are making me as horny
as a billy goat in a pepper patch."

52:32.360 --> 52:34.886
Aah! Stop it! That's disgusting!

52:35.080 --> 52:39.290
Billy goat? No. The truth is,
okay, you failed the test.

52:39.480 --> 52:42.051
The fact is, you would not
pick me up on a train.

52:42.240 --> 52:44.720
Would not notice
a fat-assed middle-aged mom

52:44.920 --> 52:47.924
losing her hair.
Okay. Losing... Ha-ha-ha.

52:48.080 --> 52:49.127
Yeah, that's me.

52:49.320 --> 52:51.607
You set me up to fail on this one.

52:51.800 --> 52:54.167
Okay, true, true, true.
You did. All right.

52:54.400 --> 52:58.769
But in the real world, baldy, okay,
on game day when it mattered,

52:58.960 --> 53:03.284
I did talk to you on a train, okay?
I did. It was the best thing I ever did.

53:03.480 --> 53:05.209
Really? Look at the goats.
Hey.

53:05.400 --> 53:07.243
- Hello.
- Yeah.

53:08.280 --> 53:12.285
But, heh, you know,
that's not even a good question.

53:12.480 --> 53:16.724
The real question would be,
if I did ask you to get off a train,

53:16.960 --> 53:18.883
Yeah?
Would you get off with me?

53:19.080 --> 53:21.367
Of course not.
I have people waiting for me.

53:21.560 --> 53:26.282
You know, and, heh, heh,
a 41-year-old horny billy goat.

53:26.480 --> 53:30.121
How creepy. I'm creeped out
right now. Help!

53:30.320 --> 53:32.288
I can't believe I'm 41.

53:32.520 --> 53:34.841
Yeah, me neither. You've gotten so old.
Heh.

53:35.040 --> 53:37.441
I never thought I'd sleep
with anyone over 40.

53:37.640 --> 53:40.405
Actually, you're the oldest guy
I've ever slept with.

53:40.600 --> 53:43.922
That's something. I'm not the
oldest guy you've ever blown.

53:44.120 --> 53:45.451
What?

53:45.640 --> 53:48.166
That conference in Warsaw.

53:48.400 --> 53:50.721
What conference?
Lech Walesa.

53:50.920 --> 53:52.524
Lech Walesa?

53:52.680 --> 53:54.762
Oh, what are you talking about?
It's okay.

53:54.960 --> 53:57.930
It was before we were together.
It's... You can admit it.

53:58.120 --> 54:02.409
I can remember the way you talked
about how he opened your heart.

54:02.600 --> 54:06.286
You definitely blew him. Definitely.
Oh, okay. You're really crazy.

54:06.480 --> 54:09.802
That was Gorbachev, okay,
you geographically-challenged,

54:10.000 --> 54:13.527
football-obsessed, doughnut-loving
American. That was Gorbachev.

54:13.720 --> 54:15.768
I got my Eastern bloc leaders
mixed up.

54:15.960 --> 54:17.121
And I didn't blow him

54:17.320 --> 54:19.971
at all. Okay? Take it back.
Okay, okay, okay.

54:20.160 --> 54:21.730
God.

54:22.720 --> 54:24.848
So was it VÃ¡clav Havel?

54:25.040 --> 54:27.281
All right, you know...
Heh, heh.

54:28.720 --> 54:31.291
Listen to this. I was gonna wait
to tell you this

54:31.440 --> 54:34.330
till later, but I'm so bad
with secrets.

54:34.520 --> 54:36.682
You have a tumor
in your brain? Gonna die?

54:36.880 --> 54:39.201
No, no, no.
Nothing like that. All right?

54:39.360 --> 54:42.887
Well, actually,
it's kind of like that. Um...

54:43.040 --> 54:44.166
My grandmother died.

54:44.360 --> 54:47.569
What? When?
Yeah. My dad texted me before we ate.

54:47.800 --> 54:49.802
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Why didn't you tell me?

54:49.960 --> 54:53.681
Everybody's been expecting it. She
lived a long time, had a great life.

54:53.840 --> 54:55.524
She was 96.

54:55.680 --> 54:58.365
Hm. Didn't live much longer
after your grandfather died?

54:58.560 --> 54:59.721
Barely a year.

54:59.880 --> 55:03.441
I mean, the funny thing is, this
woman was a freaking saint. Okay?

55:03.600 --> 55:06.604
She was a nurse in the war.
She took care of all of us.

55:06.800 --> 55:09.849
I mean, she never said an
unkind word about anybody.

55:10.040 --> 55:11.849
I wish I'd met her.
It's okay.

55:12.040 --> 55:16.011
It's okay. By the end, she just really
wasn't into meeting new people.

55:16.200 --> 55:19.602
I mean, after a lifetime
of being sweet as pie,

55:19.800 --> 55:22.610
once Grandpa died,
she got kind of ornery.

55:22.840 --> 55:23.841
It happens.

55:24.000 --> 55:25.047
She was in mourning, no?

55:25.200 --> 55:28.966
Well, my dad said
she was just waiting to die.

55:29.160 --> 55:32.130
How long were they married?
Seventy-four years.

55:32.320 --> 55:35.767
Fuck. How is that even possible?
Ha-ha-ha.

55:35.960 --> 55:37.246
I know.

55:37.440 --> 55:40.284
How old will we be
if we are together 74 years?

55:40.480 --> 55:43.404
Um, when would we start
counting from?

55:43.600 --> 55:47.730
I guess from the first time we had sex.
Okay. Yeah, good.

55:47.920 --> 55:51.003
Okay.
So, um, 1994.

55:51.240 --> 55:52.810
Okay, '94.

55:55.160 --> 55:59.165
Fifty-six years from now.
Yeah. We will be 98.

55:59.320 --> 56:00.526
Oh!

56:01.960 --> 56:05.169
Will you be able to put up with
me for another 56 more years?

56:05.360 --> 56:08.125
I don't know if I'm gonna be able
to put up with you.

56:08.280 --> 56:10.886
It's crazy if you think about
the change they saw.

56:11.040 --> 56:13.486
When they met,
neither of them had electricity.

56:13.680 --> 56:15.887
He used to take her to school
on his horse.

56:16.080 --> 56:17.366
So romantic.
I know.

56:17.600 --> 56:19.967
He was Valedictorian
and she was salutatorian.

56:20.160 --> 56:21.207
What is that?

56:21.360 --> 56:23.488
Um, he was top of the class.
She was second.

56:23.640 --> 56:27.326
She got a couple answers wrong to
make sure he didn't feel threatened.

56:27.480 --> 56:31.121
If she wanted to get laid, she better have.
Yeah, like you know who.

56:31.320 --> 56:36.770
All right. Anyway, so I called my dad after I
got the text, just to tell him I was sorry,

56:36.960 --> 56:38.485
but I think I screwed up.

56:38.680 --> 56:41.251
At some point I told him,
"You're an orphan now."

56:41.440 --> 56:43.761
You know, and he didn't think
that was funny.

56:43.960 --> 56:46.440
No, it's not funny at all.
Yeah, I guess not. Heh, heh.

56:46.600 --> 56:48.204
He's next, then you.
I know.

56:48.400 --> 56:52.041
Well, he told me that my grandparents
wanna have a joint service.

56:52.200 --> 56:56.046
Right? They wanna have their ashes
intermingled and be buried as one.

56:56.200 --> 56:58.009
Grandfather didn't have a funeral?

56:58.160 --> 57:00.731
They vowed never to attend
one another's funeral.

57:00.880 --> 57:02.086
Oh, yeah.

57:02.240 --> 57:05.050
I kind of like the idea
of you attending mine.

57:05.400 --> 57:06.447
Heh. What?
No, I know.

57:06.640 --> 57:09.246
What?
I... You know, imagining you in a suit,

57:09.480 --> 57:12.927
clean-shaven for once,
holding hands with the girls. I like it.

57:13.120 --> 57:14.451
You're gonna outlive me.

57:14.640 --> 57:17.564
Well, we'll see.
Or I guess, one of us will see.

57:17.720 --> 57:21.327
Heh. Well, you think you wanna
go to the service with me?

57:21.520 --> 57:24.729
To Texas?
Uh, it's not gonna be in Paris.

57:24.960 --> 57:26.962
Okay. How bad
do you want me there?

57:27.160 --> 57:29.640
I'd come, but it's expensive
with the flights.

57:31.040 --> 57:32.280
Truth is, it'd be simpler to go alone.

57:32.480 --> 57:34.164
Oh, hello.
Yeah, hello, buddy.

57:34.360 --> 57:37.887
And if I'm not there, it'll be easier
for you to fuck your cousins.

57:38.080 --> 57:39.320
Yes, that's true. Ha, ha.
Yeah.

57:39.560 --> 57:41.847
Isn't that common
where you come from?

57:42.040 --> 57:44.566
You didn't answer the question.
What question?

57:44.760 --> 57:48.651
Well, will you be able to put up
with me for another 56 more years?

57:48.840 --> 57:50.365
I am looking forward to it.

57:50.560 --> 57:52.562
Shit, you're really working it.
Mm-hm.

57:52.720 --> 57:57.089
The nectar of
your sex ages like a fine wine.

57:57.280 --> 57:59.487
Uh-oh.
My hairy Spanish lover is back.

57:59.680 --> 58:02.126
Greek. I'm Greek now.
Oh, you're Greek now.

58:02.320 --> 58:04.129
Look at this.

58:04.600 --> 58:08.571
Wow. This place reminds me of a
movie I saw when I was a teenager.

58:08.760 --> 58:11.366
It was a black-and-white film
from the '50s.

58:11.520 --> 58:14.603
I remember a couple walking
through the ruins of Pompeii

58:14.800 --> 58:17.406
looking at bodies
lying there for centuries.

58:17.600 --> 58:20.080
I remember the bodies,
caught in their sleep,

58:20.280 --> 58:22.806
still lovingly holding each other.

58:23.200 --> 58:26.443
I don't know why. Sometimes
I have this image in my mind

58:26.640 --> 58:29.120
when, you know, we're asleep
and you hold me.

58:29.320 --> 58:33.120
Of being buried alive under molten ash?
That's what you're thinking about?

58:33.320 --> 58:35.084
Ha-ha-ha.
That's not very fun.

58:35.280 --> 58:37.886
Well, I don't know.
It's not horrible.

58:38.040 --> 58:41.123
They had bodies with little kids
sleeping between them.

58:41.320 --> 58:42.526
Oh, that's nice.
Yeah.

58:42.720 --> 58:44.370
I was young and a bit morbid.

58:44.520 --> 58:47.603
You romanticize the idea of dying
with the person you love.

58:47.760 --> 58:49.364
Right? You wanna die with me?

58:49.560 --> 58:51.881
Maybe. You know, if we were...

58:52.080 --> 58:55.607
You know, our first night
together then, a long time ago,

58:55.800 --> 58:57.529
but now, no, I'd like to live.

58:57.720 --> 59:00.405
I wanted you to say something romantic.
You blew it.

59:00.560 --> 59:01.641
Oh, no.

59:03.000 --> 59:05.970
I blew it. Okay, if we're both
98, you can ask me again.

59:06.160 --> 59:07.605
But anytime sooner...

59:10.080 --> 59:11.525
Sorry.
Hey.

59:11.680 --> 59:15.127
This is the chapel I was telling
you about from the Byzantine era.

59:15.320 --> 59:17.129
It's 1000 years old.
Can we go in?

59:17.320 --> 59:19.527
Yeah, I think so.
Okay.

59:19.720 --> 59:21.609
Check this out.

59:21.800 --> 59:24.246
Hello? Yeah.
Wow.

59:25.200 --> 59:29.524
It's a shrine to Saint Odilia,
the patron saint to eyesight.

59:29.680 --> 59:32.968
People come from all over,
leave dedications to the blind

59:33.120 --> 59:35.441
to help restore sight.
Hm.

59:35.640 --> 59:37.051
I'm sure it works.

59:37.200 --> 59:38.964
Hey, these paintings here,

59:39.160 --> 59:43.609
they make me think of those Japanese
monks, you know, impermanence.

59:43.800 --> 59:46.007
They paint with water
on rock on a hot day.

59:46.160 --> 59:48.606
By the time they're done,
it's evaporated.

59:49.120 --> 59:51.851
Eyes are scratched out.
Is that about the blindness?

59:52.040 --> 59:54.646
No, I thought that too,
but the caretaker guy,

59:54.840 --> 59:58.162
he told me that the Turks did that
during the occupation.

59:59.160 --> 01:00:01.970
That's it.
I'm never eating Turkish food again.

01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:06.370
Heh, heh. Okay, that'll send a shiver
through the international community.

01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:08.847
Okay, fine. Then I'll never suck
another Turkish cock.

01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:12.567
Heh. Okay, that's
gonna have a global impact.

01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:14.205
Oh, that's terrible.

01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:18.610
I forgot you're a closet Christian. Is it bad
to make blow-job jokes in church?

01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:22.361
Shh. It kind of is, okay?
We've done worse.

01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:32.371
The girls asked me again
what our wedding was like.

01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:33.965
Yeah? What did you say?

01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:36.970
I say it was, uh, very low key.
Yeah.

01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:39.561
Very low key.
So low key we don't remember it.

01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:41.125
Very Quaker.
Mm-hm.

01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:45.490
I don't know why they want us to be
married so badly. It's important to them.

01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:48.650
We're in a church. Wanna get married?
No.

01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:52.441
It's just all those fairy tales
they like so much, you know?

01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:54.921
Heh, heh.
Remember when they were little

01:00:55.120 --> 01:01:00.126
and at the end of every cartoon,
they'd be like, "They're getting married,"

01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:04.120
even if it was Pinocchio and his dad,
Donald Duck and his nephews.

01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:12.167
If we're gonna spend
56 more years together,

01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:14.249
Yeah?
What about me would you change?

01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:17.968
What?
One of your can't-win questions.

01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:20.361
I'm not answering that.
What do you mean?

01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:23.251
There's not one thing
you'd like to change about me?

01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:25.607
I'm perfect? Okay.
Okay, actually...

01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:28.610
One thing. Uh-huh.
If I could change one thing about you,

01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:32.441
it would be for you
to stop trying to change me.

01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:34.449
You're a very skilled manipulator.
Mm-hm.

01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:37.962
Well, I am on to you.
I know how you work.

01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:40.083
You think?
I know everything about you.

01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:43.045
Let's go through here.
I don't think you do.

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:44.645
Ha-ha-ha.
No? Okay.

01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:47.525
Well, I know you better than I
know anybody else on the planet.

01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:50.240
But maybe that's not saying much.
Right now,

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:53.171
What?
This is great. I feel close to you.

01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:54.805
Yeah.
But sometimes

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:58.368
I feel like, uh, you're breathing
helium and I'm breathing oxygen.

01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:00.160
What makes you say that? Huh?

01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:03.006
See? I'm trying to connect
Heh, I'm being myself.

01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:05.208
And you make a joke.
Ha-ha-ha.

01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:07.920
- That's exactly what I'm talking about.
- Come on.

01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:10.441
If we're ever gonna truly know
one another,

01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:13.928
we'd probably have to get
to know ourselves better first.

01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:16.165
Yeah.

01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:20.241
Do you remember this friend of
mine, George, from New York?

01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:21.566
No.

01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:23.882
Oh, no, that was before.
What was?

01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:26.401
No, no.
Anyway, he was this friend of mine

01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:30.321
that when he found out he had
leukemia and was probably gonna die,

01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:33.444
the first thing that came
to his mind was relief.

01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:35.051
Relief? At what?
Yeah.

01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:39.404
Before he found out he had nine months
to live, he was worried about money.

01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:44.401
And now his thought was, "I have enough
money to live nine months. I've made it."

01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:46.045
Oh, okay.
I mean...

01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:51.127
He was finally able to enjoy everything
about life, even being stuck in traffic.

01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:55.609
He would just enjoy looking at people,
staring at their faces, just little things.

01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:57.529
And then what happened?

01:02:57.720 --> 01:02:59.006
What do you mean?

01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:01.043
Well, like, is he still alive?

01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:03.891
No, he died a long time ago.

01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:09.168
Last night, I had this dream
where I was reading a book.

01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:11.806
Okay. It was a lost classic.
The Rovers.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.480
The Rovers?
Yeah. Like roving around, wandering.

01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:17.166
All these young people.
Is that a real book?

01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:21.490
No, but it was great. It was fresh,
funny, experimental, had all this energy.

01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:24.968
I love that you read in your dreams.
And they're really good.

01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:27.242
I have, like,
major action-hero dreams.

01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:32.241
Like I'm flying around like a
superhero, breaking through walls.

01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:35.041
And at the end, I have an orgasm.

01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:39.731
Well, I'm gonna try to make
your dreams come true, baby.

01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:41.126
Yee.

01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:56.609
Still there.

01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:01.529
Still there.

01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:14.969
Still there.

01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:21.163
Still there.

01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:29.045
Gone.

01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:44.850
I need your credit card.

01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:46.644
Oh, I think the room is paid for.

01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:49.411
Yeah.
Yes, it is, but the credit card is for...

01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:53.361
For all possible outcomes.
Incidentals.

01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:54.641
Right. Of course.

01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:55.966
Mr. Wallace?
Yeah.

01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:58.367
I am such a fan of these two books.

01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:00.761
My husband gave me your book
on our date

01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:04.481
and when your second book came out,
we read it out loud together.

01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:05.727
Oh, wow.

01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:08.810
Would you please sign them to us?
Of course. Of course.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:13.561
I love the artwork on these
Greek editions. It's really nice.

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:17.881
What are your names?
Make it to Sophia and Pavlos.

01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:19.730
Okay.

01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:23.289
How's the Greek translation?

01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:32.170
But I'm not sure it's the correct word.
You never read them in English.

01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:33.765
Exactly.

01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:36.571
That's great.

01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:38.000
Could you sign them too?

01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:41.325
Me?
Yes, you're the real Madeleine, right?

01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:44.324
Madeleine? Not really.

01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:47.444
I mean, people assume it's me,
but it's not me at all.

01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:49.449
He's got a big imagination.

01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:53.249
Would you be so kind?
It would mean so much to my husband.

01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:58.646
I can't sign a book I didn't write. it...
She'd be happy to.

01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:00.604
Okay.
Great. Thank you.

01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:02.689
I'm happy to.

01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:05.250
Uh...

01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:09.641
Thank you.

01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:13.082
Okay.
Great. Thank you so much.

01:06:17.240 --> 01:06:18.401
Check it out.

01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:20.602
Wow. This is nice.
Yeah.

01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:23.406
Clean, air conditioning.

01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:26.206
I love it. Oh, my God.
Isn't it great?

01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:32.168
Wow. Oh, wow. A bathtub. My God.

01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:34.010
Hey, check this out.

01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:38.967
Stefanos and Ariadni got us
a bottle of wine and a couple's massage.

01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:41.686
We have to get them a present
before we leave.

01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:45.885
We should get something for the kids.
Yeah, I know, for sure.

01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:47.041
Wow.

01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:54.049
Oh, I miss the girls.

01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:55.531
Mm. I don't.

01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:58.087
This is such a nice view.

01:06:58.320 --> 01:07:02.166
The only view
that I am interested in...

01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:06.245
What? What?
Is right

01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:08.369
here.

01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:14.124
Yeah. It's this.

01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:30.930
What?

01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:37.881
It's funny, I never noticed until today,
but all the red in your beard is gone.

01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:42.006
It used to be one of the things
that made me fall for you. It's crazy.

01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:49.088
It's not gone. It's just white.

01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:53.126
You're not gonna tell me that your
love is dependent on pigment, are you?

01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:56.563
Huh? No?
No, no, but, you know...

01:07:57.640 --> 01:07:59.961
I see the red
in our girls' eye lashes.

01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:03.801
I look at them and it makes me
think of when we met.

01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:10.205
Mm.
Know what I'm looking forward to?

01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:12.567
Yeah? What?
After, uh...

01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:15.240
After? Ha-ha-ha.
You know... Ha-ha.

01:08:15.880 --> 01:08:19.122
What?
Is waking up next to you tomorrow.

01:08:19.359 --> 01:08:22.170
You mean, without Nina and Ella
jumping on our heads?

01:08:22.319 --> 01:08:24.049
Exactly.

01:08:24.479 --> 01:08:27.086
I haven't heard you think
in years now.

01:08:27.279 --> 01:08:28.884
Think?
Yeah.

01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:30.569
Oh.

01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:36.487
I used to wake up to that sound
of your eyes opening and closing.

01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:40.366
That brain of yours
going <i>2</i> million miles an hour.

01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:44.484
I miss it, hearing you think.

01:08:45.319 --> 01:08:48.403
When you said you could hear
me think, I thought you could.

01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:51.803
But it's just my eyelids.
How dumb and romantic of me.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.241
Mm. It was my favorite thing.

01:08:55.399 --> 01:08:59.121
Mm. I miss thinking too.

01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:02.964
No more thinking in the morning,
no more morning sex.

01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:05.247
Tomorrow.

01:09:06.399 --> 01:09:10.200
I'm looking forward to it so much,
I don't think I will sleep.

01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:15.724
I'm looking forward to right now.

01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:17.279
Okay.

01:09:17.479 --> 01:09:22.281
Okay, let's stop talking
so we can fuck,

01:09:22.479 --> 01:09:27.441
sleep, wake up, think,
and fuck again.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.479
Don't answer it.
Ha, ha. No.

01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:40.920
Oh, shit, who is it? No.

01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:43.087
Who cares?
Okay.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:49.767
I said to call in case of emergency only.
I hope the girls are okay.

01:09:50.439 --> 01:09:51.850
Okay.

01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:54.321
Oh, it's Henry. Okay.

01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:56.488
Hey, sweetie, are you okay?

01:09:57.040 --> 01:09:58.769
Are you in London?

01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:00.366
Oh.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:02.650
Oh, already? Okay.

01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:07.971
Oh, no, no, we found it.

01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:11.648
We'll mail it tomorrow.
Don't worry. Yeah, yeah.

01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:17.723
Yeah. Oh, they miss you too.
I'll kiss them for you.

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:19.609
Yeah.

01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:22.763
Okay, I'll tell him.

01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:24.246
Good luck with your mom.

01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:26.920
Yeah. I love you too. Bye.

01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:28.764
Okay.

01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:30.886
Okay.

01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:34.488
He's fine. He says he'll call you
from Chicago when he lands.

01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:37.331
Why can't I talk to him?
Twice you've done that.

01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:39.602
You could have just
handed me the phone.

01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:41.962
He didn't have time.
They were boarding.

01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:43.446
What did he forget?

01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:47.201
His science project.
But we'll mail it tomorrow. It'll be fine.

01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:49.482
Shouldn't have said that
about his mom.

01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:52.803
What? What did I say?
"Good luck with your mom."

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.207
Heh. Come on.
I didn't mean anything by it.

01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:59.530
I know, but it's not good. It reminds him.
And I wish you wouldn't do that.

01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:04.123
That's so American to just swipe it under
the carpet and act as if it didn't happen.

01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:05.805
Why put it into his head?

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:09.049
What if he doesn't wanna be
thinking about that right now?

01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:12.250
It means nothing.
It means something. It does.

01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:14.090
I made a joke the other day

01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:18.046
that his mom and I should settle it
in one big mud wrestling contest.

01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:20.971
Mud wrestling? You said that?
And he laughed.

01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:24.562
He might have more of a sense
of humor than you do. Come on.

01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:29.124
You say bad things about his morn,
he hears bad things about himself.

01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:33.689
I didn't say anything bad about his mom. I made a joke.
It's on me as it is on her.

01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:38.169
I know, I know. It's just,
why conjure it up at all, you know?

01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:39.885
I think he's old enough now.

01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:43.448
I mean, he knows how bad it is
between his mother and I.

01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:47.008
His mom and me. And I didn't do anything.
It's all from her.

01:11:47.240 --> 01:11:50.722
Okay, she hates me. Yes,
I fucked her husband a long time ago.

01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:52.684
Or should I say he fucked me?

01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:54.928
Heh. Yeah, right.
Okay.

01:11:55.160 --> 01:11:58.960
Making a joke that his mom and I
don't love each other is not the issue.

01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:01.964
That's not gonna traumatize him.
That already happened.

01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:05.124
And now you're trying
to transfer your guilt and blame me.

01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:06.327
No, I'm not.

01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:11.082
On the contrary, if he can joke about it,
maybe he'll be able to live with it better.

01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:16.161
Okay, you're right, as always.
Let's just not talk about it, okay?

01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:21.368
Mm-hm. Right. It's nobody's fault if his mom
is a drunk and abusive psychologically.

01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:23.443
Don't say that.

01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:25.887
It makes me sick
that he has to be with her.

01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:28.924
But judges assume
that women have the mother instinct.

01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:31.851
She has the mother instinct of Medea.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:33.445
Medea, huh?

01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:35.768
Yeah. After all, it is a Greek myth.

01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:37.883
Actually a play by Euripides, but...

01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:40.771
A woman killing her kids
to punish her ex-husband.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.651
That's what she's doing.
Hurting him to get to you.

01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:47.521
No, she's making my life hell
through him, that's what she's doing.

01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:52.203
And sometimes you say things
that just go too far.

01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:55.165
Stop blaming me
for everything wrong with your wife.

01:12:55.360 --> 01:12:59.046
Ex-wife, ex-wife. For a long time.
Okay.

01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:02.130
Should have dealt with it.
She wouldn't have hated us.

01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:04.527
Okay, okay, I screwed up.

01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:07.560
I just love this little re-write
you do

01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:12.448
that everything that isn't perfect
in our life gets laid at my feet.

01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:15.765
And now you're putting this shit
on me about Henry.

01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:18.122
What shit?
What are you talking about?

01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:23.008
Let me tell you what I'm talking about.
The moving to Chicago, giving up my life.

01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:28.884
You mentioned that Henry needs you.
How do you think that makes me feel?

01:13:29.080 --> 01:13:31.003
I'm miserable. All right?

01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:33.248
How can I take that job now?
Okay.

01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:36.364
Tell me. I'll feel too guilty. No, no, no.
Come here.

01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:40.042
That's a choice you're making,
to look at it like that. All right?

01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:43.323
It is in the nature of women
to be the nurturer.

01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:45.449
The what?
The nurturer.

01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:48.723
The nurturer?
Okay, I can't even say that fucking word.

01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:53.642
I just naturally feel bad about everything.
And you give that look, like it's my fault.

01:13:53.840 --> 01:13:56.684
What look?
The I-forgot-the-science-project look.

01:13:56.880 --> 01:13:59.247
I know you blame me.
I didn't say anything.

01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:03.161
No, you didn't say anything.
You didn't have to. It's always my fault.

01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:05.249
Yeah, right.

01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:07.482
I read on the fridge at work...

01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:10.923
You know those magnet words
that people make sentences with?

01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:12.081
Mm-hm.

01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:16.564
Someone had put together,
"Women explore for eternity

01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:18.802
in the vast garden of sacrifice."

01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:23.804
Wow. That's a sure sign from God.
Yeah.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:28.164
That line is so damn true, and it's been
for 10,000 years, but that's enough.

01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:30.289
I don't wanna be one of these women.

01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:34.127
Like marriage is important to gays,
or contraception to women rights.

01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:38.763
It's the same with giving up my hopes,
with women that had to give up hopes.

01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:42.885
I'm not gonna do it. This is bigger
than me. This means more than me.

01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:49.731
Wow. Bravo.
The Nobel Committee is taking note.

01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:52.884
I'm just... Hold on a second.
I'm gonna alert Sweden.

01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:56.527
It must be a full-time job carrying
that much feminine oppression.

01:14:56.760 --> 01:14:58.683
It is.
You suffered so much

01:14:58.840 --> 01:15:00.763
growing up in middle-class Paris.

01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:04.606
The agony in the trenches of
the Sorbonne in the post-feminist era.

01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:06.842
I can't imagine.
You're an asshole.

01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:10.523
You know what, sweetie,
when are we moving to Chicago?

01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:13.610
I wanna make sure
we are able to find a nice house

01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:17.202
and I can sew the drapes
and pick matching bed covers.

01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:20.165
This is how you now want
to be spending this evening?

01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:22.647
This is what you wanna do?
You started it.

01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:26.561
No, you are the one
who will not shut up about it.

01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:29.923
But if you wanna talk about it,
really talk about it,

01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:34.205
I would prefer to have an
unemotional, rational conversation.

01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:36.010
Do you think we could do that?

01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:39.044
Here we go, unemotional, rational.

01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:42.244
You always play the part
of the one and only rational one.

01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:45.961
And I'm the irrational, hysterical,
hormone-crazy one

01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:47.605
because I have emotions.

01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:50.531
You sit back and speak
from your big perspective,

01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:53.166
which means
everything you say is true.

01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:54.890
I don't always do anything.

01:15:55.080 --> 01:15:58.801
The world is fucked by unemotional,
rational men deciding shit.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:03.449
Politicians going to war, corporate heads
deciding to wreck the environment.

01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:06.530
Cheney, Rumsfeld, very rational men.

01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:08.563
Cheney and Rumsfeld,
yeah, okay.

01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:11.843
The Final Solution,
very rational thinking behind that.

01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:13.411
Okay. So we're there now?

01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:17.047
Us versus the Final Solution?
Okay. Let's do it. All right.

01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:19.083
Let me ask you this, all right?

01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:22.084
Do you think Henry's life
would be helped

01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:24.760
by a more consistent presence
by you and me? Huh?

01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:27.046
Here we go.
No.

01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:31.131
You won't drop it, so let's talk.
Let me just ask you one question.

01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:33.887
Think Hank's life
would be better served

01:16:34.040 --> 01:16:36.202
by consistent presence
from you and me?

01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:39.250
Yes, it'd be better if he lived with us.
Okay.

01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:42.284
I think his mom
is a fucking alcoholic, hateful cunt

01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:46.007
that used the time we were in Paris
and I was giving birth

01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:49.722
to legally move Henry out of
New York. Fuck her.

01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:52.647
Okay. I agree with you.
Mm-hm.

01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:55.724
Okay. Unfortunately,
we cannot go get him out of America,

01:16:55.960 --> 01:16:58.566
but we could, if we wanted to,
go to him.

01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:01.246
Now, I know it would be
a big move.

01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:05.445
But what do you think? ls there any way
that you could be happy in the U.S.?

01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:10.288
Is that just out of the realm of possibility?
That you could find a comparable job?

01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:11.771
Comparable job?
Yeah.

01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:13.331
Are you kidding?
No.

01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:16.444
Why am I the one that have
to make the compromises?

01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:19.007
Don't be so dramatic. Okay?
It should be...

01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:21.931
Moving to Chicago
is pretty fucking dramatic for me.

01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:26.330
I'm not saying we should move.
I just wanna talk about it.

01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:29.251
Can you be my friend
for two seconds so we can talk?

01:17:29.440 --> 01:17:30.680
Two seconds.
All right.

01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:33.844
Remember that time you were late
to pick the girls up

01:17:34.040 --> 01:17:38.841
and you were so stressed out because
they were wondering what happened?

01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:41.884
Okay, that is the way
that I feel all the time.

01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:46.165
Like I fucked up. I mean, I left him
behind and I just wanna go get him.

01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:49.005
You always get like this
when you drop him off.

01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:51.168
You're sad, so you start a fight.

01:17:51.720 --> 01:17:53.370
He's fine.

01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:56.490
He's a great kid, okay?

01:17:56.680 --> 01:17:59.251
Truth is, he doesn't need you
the way he used to.

01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:03.843
You missed the opportunity to be with him
every day of his childhood. You did.

01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:07.681
And you can cry about it,
but he's growing up.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:12.085
You're a great father in other ways.
You got divorced

01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:16.165
like millions of other people.
Was it ideal? No. But...

01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:20.401
Listen, if in one month
you still want me to quit my job

01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:24.082
and give up everything I've
been working towards, just ask,

01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:27.847
but right now
I feel the same way I always have.

01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:32.250
I would move to the U.S. if that ex-wife
of yours would give us joint custody.

01:18:32.440 --> 01:18:35.125
But every other weekend
amounts to shit.

01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:36.964
That's less than
30 days a semester.

01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:41.842
I don't think it's worth it for us to change
our entire lives over that kind of time.

01:18:42.040 --> 01:18:44.122
I know. You're right. Mm-hm.
Right? Right?

01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:46.761
See, I'm being the rational one.

01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:50.880
Oh, it's just such a shitty position,
you know?

01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:54.806
Hank didn't do anything, but he's the
one getting kicked in the teeth.

01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:57.441
We all get dragged
through our parents' lives.

01:18:57.640 --> 01:19:00.644
Your marriage would have ended
over something else.

01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:03.451
Absolutely.
Or worse, he would've been raised

01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:05.409
by two miserable parents.
Right.

01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:10.207
I just really fucked that up.

01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:15.962
You mean, you fucked up by moving
to Paris to be with me?

01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:20.250
No. That's not what I meant. Stop.
I knew that was gonna cost too much.

01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:22.767
I told you not to do it, okay?
Stop it.

01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:28.486
Okay, I moved to New York with you
for two years and gave up everything.

01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:31.365
I needed to be home
to give birth to the twins

01:19:31.560 --> 01:19:34.530
and I wanted to be with my mother.
You wanted it too.

01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:37.160
Yes.
That's the one thing I asked from you.

01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:40.330
The one thing, and now you're gonna
blame me forever?

01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:44.646
Stop it, will you? Stop it.

01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:50.205
If you don't wanna move back
to the States, we won't. End of story.

01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:52.368
I am just trying to find a way

01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:55.444
where I could be a more consistent
presence in his life.

01:19:55.640 --> 01:19:58.405
And ideally, I'd like to do that
as a family.

01:19:59.240 --> 01:20:01.481
"As a family"? Or what?

01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:03.483
What the fuck does that mean?

01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:08.885
I feel a passive-aggressive threat
in everything you say.

01:20:09.080 --> 01:20:13.802
Either do this or I will resent you
for the rest of our lives.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:15.570
You know?

01:20:16.040 --> 01:20:17.804
Am I right?

01:20:19.320 --> 01:20:22.642
You know what? You know what?
I'm sensing something.

01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:27.408
I think the problem is, is that you don't
want me to have a more substantial job.

01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:31.002
On some level, you feel threatened
by my achieving anything

01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:34.044
that could diminish your status
in our relationship.

01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:36.607
My status in our relationship?

01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:40.805
I teach two courses a semester
at the fucking American School.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.765
Okay. Wow, that's really some status.

01:20:43.960 --> 01:20:46.440
I don't think it's coincidence
you feel that

01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:49.769
at the same time
I have a truly exciting job opportunity.

01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:54.084
This whole train of thought
is complete horseshit and you know it.

01:20:54.640 --> 01:20:56.847
I have a question for you.

01:20:57.080 --> 01:21:02.120
If we didn't have the girls and all our
crap, would we even still be together?

01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:04.049
What?

01:21:04.240 --> 01:21:07.369
You are the fucking mayor
of crazy town, do you know that?

01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:11.201
You know what I think? You need
to move to Chicago. Henry needs you.

01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:13.971
I stay in Paris with the girls
and take this job.

01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:15.525
Why are you doing this?
Huh?

01:21:15.760 --> 01:21:17.410
That is a ridiculous idea.

01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:21.884
I'm gonna lose you and the girls? No. Why
do you make everything so difficult?

01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:25.641
You're unhappy. You're blaming me
for taking you away from your son.

01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:28.491
That is a completely irrational
response

01:21:28.680 --> 01:21:31.809
to something I'm just trying
to feel my way through.

01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:37.007
Listen, Jesse, we've just
spent the last six weeks here,

01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:39.928
and it's been great.

01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:45.082
You've been able to write every day
and the weather's been nice.

01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:48.251
But I didn't wanna come to Greece.
I know.

01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:51.171
All right? There could be
a revolution any second.

01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:54.489
Oh, God.
People eat a lot of feta and olive oil

01:21:54.680 --> 01:21:58.765
and they act all happy, but they
actually talk about how angry they are

01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:01.725
and it confuses me. I don't
know what's gonna happen.

01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:04.042
Oh-oh-oh. Let me
tell you what's gonna happen.

01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:07.323
The same thing
that always happens.

01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:09.562
Nothing.

01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:13.282
All right. Know what? I have had
absolutely zero time for myself.

01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:16.649
I have 10,000 e-mails I have to
answer that I didn't answer.

01:22:16.840 --> 01:22:17.966
You think I don't?

01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:21.647
I spend all day making dinner
and wiping you and your son's pee

01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:23.842
while you talk to fellow novelists.

01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:29.689
Blah, blah, blah, you're a genius. Oh,
blah, blah, blah, no, you're a genius.

01:22:29.880 --> 01:22:31.803
Mm-hm.
The second we say goodbye to Henry,

01:22:31.960 --> 01:22:34.884
you suggest I give up
my dream job.

01:22:35.080 --> 01:22:36.889
Oh, okay, now it's your dream job?

01:22:37.080 --> 01:22:40.084
This afternoon
you weren't even sure you wanted it.

01:22:40.280 --> 01:22:42.089
Do you ever listen to yourself?

01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:46.643
It is my dream job. Just because I have
doubts doesn't mean I don't want it.

01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:48.251
Okay.
But why do you care?

01:22:48.480 --> 01:22:52.041
You go on your two-hour contemplative
walk under the olive trees.

01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:54.527
Socrates. You should get a robe.

01:22:54.680 --> 01:22:56.330
Uh-huh. It's an hour.

01:22:56.520 --> 01:23:00.047
By the time you leave and by the
time you're with us, two hours.

01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:01.441
I could never do that.

01:23:01.640 --> 01:23:05.929
You're good at taking care of yourself. I
take care of myself and everything else.

01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:08.925
We go, you pack your bag.
I pack everything else.

01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:12.482
You would never let me pack
the girls' shit. Never.

01:23:12.680 --> 01:23:15.047
There would be no shoes
and dirty underwear.

01:23:15.200 --> 01:23:16.565
Yeah, right, so says you.

01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:20.486
No, I'm happy you have time
to contemplate the universe

01:23:20.720 --> 01:23:23.246
because I don't.
I barely have time to think.

01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:25.522
I work, I babysit,
I work, I babysit.

01:23:25.720 --> 01:23:29.566
Could you hold on a second? I just
have to tune up the string section.

01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:34.408
You know what? Only time I get to think
now is when I take a shit at the office.

01:23:34.600 --> 01:23:37.285
I'm starting to associate thoughts
with the smell of shit.

01:23:37.440 --> 01:23:41.764
Ha, ha. Well, that is a good line.
I'm gonna use that in a book someday.

01:23:41.960 --> 01:23:44.930
Yeah, I'm sure and that'll be
the best line in the book.

01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:46.690
And by the way, you may never,

01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:49.320
ever use me
or anything I say or do

01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:53.127
in one of your fucking books again.
That goes for the girls too.

01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:56.005
A, you shouldn't have
hooked up with a writer.

01:23:56.200 --> 01:23:58.646
B, you weren't in the last book
or the one now.

01:23:58.880 --> 01:24:01.451
C, I'm gonna write about
whatever the fuck I want.

01:24:01.680 --> 01:24:03.444
As always,
our life works for you.

01:24:03.680 --> 01:24:07.048
No, no, no. Don't give me this
put-upon housewife bullshit. Okay?

01:24:07.240 --> 01:24:08.366
This is not the '50s.

01:24:08.600 --> 01:24:12.525
Sorry to ruin your perfect little
narrative of oppression with the truth,

01:24:12.720 --> 01:24:15.929
but I am the one who's at home
dealing with the bullshit.

01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:18.242
You're at work until 6:30.
Six o'clock.

01:24:18.440 --> 01:24:22.411
You take the girls to school, I pick them up.
That's fair. That's our deal.

01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:28.482
We live in Paris, France, for chrissakes.
And you remind me of it every day.

01:24:28.680 --> 01:24:32.401
I have orbited my entire life
around you and you know it. Okay?

01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:35.649
Sorry if this summer's vacation...
And it is a vacation.

01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:39.487
I've seen you frolic in the sea
and shove salad down your throat.

01:24:39.720 --> 01:24:43.850
But it is not indicative of you spending
your life in domestic servitude.

01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:47.442
You know what I love about men?
They still believe in magic.

01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:50.126
Little fairies around
who pick up their socks,

01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:54.484
little fairies unload the dishwasher,
little fairies sunscreen the kids.

01:24:54.680 --> 01:24:58.082
Little fairies who make the Greek
salad that you eat like a pig.

01:24:58.320 --> 01:24:59.890
Okay, listen to me. All right?

01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:03.004
You are great at taking care of us.
You are.

01:25:03.240 --> 01:25:06.801
I mean, you take care of the kids,
you take care of your friends,

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:10.925
you take care of the world. You were
like that before you were a mom

01:25:11.160 --> 01:25:12.810
and now it's only magnified.

01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:16.010
But, and I've been telling you this
for years now,

01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:19.409
you gotta do a little better job
taking care of yourself.

01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:22.046
Okay, stop patronizing me.
All right?

01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:26.006
I'm the one at home every day at 6,
not 6:30. I'm reliable.

01:25:26.200 --> 01:25:30.524
Have you ever booked a babysitter,
ever, in your entire life? No.

01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:34.884
What is the name of their pediatrician?
Stop quizzing me. It's fucking boring.

01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:39.011
Yeah, okay. You know what? I'm at
home every night and I make dinner,

01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:42.283
give baths and read stories.
Sometimes you're there,

01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:46.565
sometimes you're at a university event
or a publicity tour. Okay?

01:25:46.760 --> 01:25:49.923
When you get inspired,
you keep on writing.

01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:52.970
I get inspired too sometimes,
you know that?

01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:55.964
You wanna write? Write.
No, but you remember

01:25:56.160 --> 01:25:58.731
I used to sing and play guitar
and write songs?

01:25:58.960 --> 01:26:02.328
I'd still like to do it,
but I don't get to. There isn't time.

01:26:02.520 --> 01:26:06.445
Okay. Well, first off,
my writing isn't a hobby. All right?

01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:09.047
Secondly,
I wish you would find the time.

01:26:09.240 --> 01:26:12.369
You somehow find time to complain
about eight hours a day.

01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:16.889
I mean,
I love the way you sing. Okay?

01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:21.843
I fucked up my whole life
because of the way you sing. All right?

01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:25.931
If you took one-eighth
of the energy that you spend

01:26:26.120 --> 01:26:28.600
on bitching, whining and worrying...

01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:33.488
If you put that energy into playing scales,
you'd be like fucking Django Reinhardt.

01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:41.851
Okay. All right.

01:26:42.040 --> 01:26:44.247
You forgot your shoes.

01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:51.089
Oh, God.

01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:52.731
Hey.

01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:05.765
You think you're winning?

01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:07.846
Few people realize

01:27:08.040 --> 01:27:12.170
what it's like for an active or
passionate woman to have a child.

01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:15.369
Friends told me, "You'll wanna
throw them out the window."

01:27:15.560 --> 01:27:20.282
But I never wanted to hurt them once, but
I thought about ending it for myself.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:24.482
I was so confused and you were
always away on a stupid book tour

01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:28.326
or because of Henry's custody shit,
and I didn't wanna be a burden.

01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:31.086
I know why Sylvia Plath
put her head in a toaster.

01:27:31.280 --> 01:27:33.726
It was an oven.
Don't play with words.

01:27:33.920 --> 01:27:36.810
You know what I mean.
Toaster, oven, same thing.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:40.561
You know how many times I was alone
crying with no clue what to do?

01:27:40.720 --> 01:27:44.008
Know the guilt a mother feels
when she doesn't know what to do?

01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:47.369
Do you think you have
sole ownership of that feeling?

01:27:47.520 --> 01:27:49.966
I don't think you understand.
Okay?

01:27:50.200 --> 01:27:53.204
You know what my secret fear is?
With every man?

01:27:53.400 --> 01:27:57.405
Is that they all wanna turn me
into a submissive housewife.

01:27:57.560 --> 01:28:00.769
Okay. No one could ever do that.
All right?

01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:05.609
I promise. It would be easier
to fit your head into a toaster

01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:08.525
than to turn you
into anything submissive.

01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:11.730
I don't think I've recovered
since giving birth.

01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:14.651
When they were born,
I had no idea what to do.

01:28:14.840 --> 01:28:18.731
People expect women
to have this instinct that kicks in

01:28:18.920 --> 01:28:20.649
like a female baboon.

01:28:20.840 --> 01:28:23.844
But I had no idea how to do anything.

01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:27.761
I loved them so much
and I was doing everything wrong.

01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:32.568
And you were away so often, calling
me and asking me how my day went,

01:28:32.760 --> 01:28:36.481
and I couldn't even say it to you
because I felt so ashamed

01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:37.806
to be so clueless.

01:28:38.040 --> 01:28:40.008
I think you did great.
No, I didn't.

01:28:40.200 --> 01:28:43.647
No, you did. Well, you did
a good job faking it, then.

01:28:44.320 --> 01:28:47.529
I just... I remember the only way
I could get them to sleep

01:28:47.720 --> 01:28:51.281
was to drag that stupid
double stroller down the stairs

01:28:51.480 --> 01:28:54.131
and walk them for hours
in the middle of the night,

01:28:54.320 --> 01:28:57.881
all the way to Pigalle and back.
I almost got mugged once.

01:28:58.080 --> 01:29:02.483
The only reason why the guy didn't
attack me is that I looked so pathetic.

01:29:02.680 --> 01:29:06.287
The only upside of being over 35 is
that you don't get raped as much.

01:29:06.480 --> 01:29:09.802
Ha-ha-ha.
I read it. It's true.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.401
Oh, Jesus.

01:29:13.760 --> 01:29:18.527
Once, I remember, I was watching the
twins on a trampoline, you know,

01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:20.643
and they looked so beautiful,

01:29:20.840 --> 01:29:23.207
and I was happy
because they were happy.

01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:26.563
You know,
one of them had this Hula-Hoop

01:29:26.760 --> 01:29:29.570
that she was using as a jump rope,
you know,

01:29:29.800 --> 01:29:34.010
but then the other one wanted it so they
started fighting over it, you know?

01:29:34.200 --> 01:29:36.248
And all of a sudden,
I just saw it all.

01:29:36.440 --> 01:29:40.729
You know, all this petty jealously
and selfishness, you know?

01:29:40.920 --> 01:29:47.485
And I remember thinking, "Okay, this,
heh, is the natural human state."

01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:53.210
You know, just always a little dissatisfied,
perpetually discontented, you know?

01:29:53.400 --> 01:29:56.244
I mean, heh, look at us.

01:29:56.440 --> 01:30:00.570
Here we are, we are in, you know,
the Garden of Eden

01:30:00.760 --> 01:30:03.286
and we can't stop fighting.

01:30:03.840 --> 01:30:06.366
I don't think there's
one natural human state.

01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:08.085
The human state is multiple.

01:30:08.280 --> 01:30:11.568
If that's what you see when
you're watching the girls play,

01:30:11.800 --> 01:30:13.962
that means you're depressed.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.207
Okay. Maybe I am.

01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:21.530
No, but when I see them fight, I see
beautiful energy of going forward,

01:30:21.680 --> 01:30:25.002
not letting anyone step on them
or take away what they want.

01:30:25.200 --> 01:30:28.090
I like it when they fight.
It gives me hope for them.

01:30:28.280 --> 01:30:30.442
You see anger
as a positive emotion.

01:30:30.640 --> 01:30:35.328
You know, you only end up hurting
yourself, your work, the kids, me.

01:30:37.360 --> 01:30:38.805
And you never get angry?

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.970
When I do,
I don't see it as a positive.

01:30:44.080 --> 01:30:45.969
You know something?

01:30:48.160 --> 01:30:50.891
The way you write, people
come up to me and think

01:30:51.080 --> 01:30:55.608
I make love to some wildcat
Henry Miller type. Ha!

01:30:56.680 --> 01:31:01.049
You like to have sex
the exact same way every time.

01:31:01.200 --> 01:31:03.043
Mm. When you got it, you got it.

01:31:03.240 --> 01:31:06.130
Kissy, kissy. Tittie, tittie.
Pussy.

01:31:07.520 --> 01:31:09.841
I'm a man of simple pleasures.

01:31:10.040 --> 01:31:12.646
Yeah, very simple,

01:31:12.840 --> 01:31:15.411
and I've been meaning
to tell you that lately. Tsk.

01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:19.650
You're no Henry Miller,
on any level.

01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:24.330
And you know what? Heh.
This room gives me the creeps.

01:31:24.520 --> 01:31:27.729
I was expecting something quaint,
like the real Greece.

01:31:27.960 --> 01:31:30.042
Place is real.
What are we doing here?

01:31:30.240 --> 01:31:33.881
This is too planned, like we're
supposed to have this great evening.

01:31:34.080 --> 01:31:37.084
No room for spontaneity.
It is all gone from our lives.

01:31:37.280 --> 01:31:40.090
This is stupid and it's not working.
Obviously.

01:31:40.280 --> 01:31:43.648
And I curse Ariadni and that perv
Stefanos for doing this.

01:31:43.840 --> 01:31:45.330
Okay. A couple's massage?

01:31:45.560 --> 01:31:48.040
What the fuck is that?
That sounds sleazy to me.

01:31:48.240 --> 01:31:50.971
We don't have to do it!
Okay?

01:31:51.160 --> 01:31:53.401
Come on,
this place isn't so bad.

01:31:53.600 --> 01:31:55.329
I like hotel rooms.

01:31:55.520 --> 01:31:57.124
I think they're sexy.

01:31:57.360 --> 01:31:59.442
Yeah, I know you do...

01:32:00.600 --> 01:32:02.682
Mr. Book-Tour.

01:32:04.360 --> 01:32:07.011
Mr. Radisson-Hilton.

01:32:08.280 --> 01:32:12.205
And I know that time when you were
doing that reading in Washington,

01:32:12.400 --> 01:32:16.883
when your cell phone supposedly
broke that night. How convenient.

01:32:17.840 --> 01:32:21.526
Swear on our kids you didn't fuck
that lady from the bookstore. Emily.

01:32:22.160 --> 01:32:24.970
Swear to me
you didn't fuck that Emily girl.

01:32:25.160 --> 01:32:27.527
And I'm not jealous
because I'm not the type.

01:32:27.720 --> 01:32:30.883
But I just wanna know. Okay?
Be a man and admit the truth.

01:32:32.640 --> 01:32:35.883
I am giving you my whole life,
okay?

01:32:36.080 --> 01:32:38.651
I got nothing larger to give.

01:32:38.840 --> 01:32:40.763
I'm not giving it to anybody else.

01:32:42.280 --> 01:32:45.648
If you're looking for permission
to disqualify me,

01:32:45.840 --> 01:32:47.683
I'm not gonna give it to you.

01:32:47.880 --> 01:32:51.327
Okay? I love you,

01:32:51.960 --> 01:32:55.601
and I am not in conflict
about it. Okay?

01:32:55.840 --> 01:32:58.002
But if what you want
is a laundry list

01:32:58.200 --> 01:33:01.522
of things about you that
piss me off, I could give it to you.

01:33:01.760 --> 01:33:04.161
Yeah. I want to hear.
Okay. Well, uh,

01:33:04.320 --> 01:33:08.848
let's start at number one, okay?
Number one, you're fucking nuts.

01:33:09.040 --> 01:33:11.611
All right? You are.
Good luck finding somebody

01:33:11.800 --> 01:33:15.247
to put up with your shit for
more than, like, six months. Okay?

01:33:15.480 --> 01:33:19.849
But I accept the whole package,
the crazy and the brilliant, all right?

01:33:20.040 --> 01:33:24.250
You're not gonna change, I don't want you to.
It's accepting you for being you.

01:33:24.440 --> 01:33:29.480
I asked a question. If, while I was carrying
that double stroller down the stairs

01:33:29.680 --> 01:33:33.765
and getting ass-raped in Pigalle, you
fucked that little Emily BrontÃ« girl?

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.731
I don't know what Emily.
What are you talking about?

01:33:36.960 --> 01:33:39.486
The one that wrote the e-mails
about Dostoevsky?

01:33:39.680 --> 01:33:41.842
"Oh, Jesse, you're so right."

01:33:42.040 --> 01:33:46.364
"The Grand Commander is the deepest
passage of all of Russian literature."

01:33:46.560 --> 01:33:48.369
If you're asking me

01:33:48.600 --> 01:33:52.730
if I'm committed to you, the girls
and the life we built together,

01:33:52.920 --> 01:33:56.447
the answer is a resounding yes.

01:33:56.640 --> 01:33:59.883
So you did fuck her.
Thank you very much.

01:34:00.080 --> 01:34:04.961
Do I ask about the time you went to your
old boyfriend after his mother died? No.

01:34:05.200 --> 01:34:08.647
Why? Because I know the way that
your fucking French ass works

01:34:08.840 --> 01:34:13.164
and I guarantee that you at least blew
that guy, but I also know you love me.

01:34:13.360 --> 01:34:16.648
All right? I'm okay with you
being a complicated human being.

01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:20.805
I don't wanna live a boring life
where two people own each other,

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:24.891
where two people are institutionalized
in a box that others created

01:34:25.080 --> 01:34:26.127
because that is a bunch

01:34:26.280 --> 01:34:29.090
of stifling bullshit!

01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:31.966
Oh, God. Well...

01:34:47.320 --> 01:34:50.722
You know what's
going on here? It's simple.

01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:54.402
I don't think
I love you anymore.

01:36:08.240 --> 01:36:10.561
Miss?
I don't wanna talk right now.

01:36:10.760 --> 01:36:12.922
Here by yourself
or waiting for somebody?

01:36:13.160 --> 01:36:14.730
I'm by myself and happy to be.

01:36:14.920 --> 01:36:18.481
I'm an angry person and I hurt my
kids, my work and everyone I love.

01:36:18.680 --> 01:36:20.808
Well, just my type-

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.844
Okay. I'm not in the mood.
I came here to be alone.

01:36:24.040 --> 01:36:28.204
I've just been checking you out, and I
don't wanna make you uncomfortable,

01:36:28.400 --> 01:36:31.768
but you are, by far, the
best-looking woman in this place.

01:36:31.960 --> 01:36:34.327
Thank you.
I'd love to buy you a drink,

01:36:34.520 --> 01:36:37.000
maybe talk to you,
get to know you a bit.

01:36:37.200 --> 01:36:38.611
Are you here on business?

01:36:39.880 --> 01:36:42.804
Okay. I see.
You have a boyfriend?

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:44.240
Not anymore.

01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:47.649
Jeez, sorry to hear that.
God, you wanna talk about it?

01:36:48.160 --> 01:36:49.605
I don't talk to strangers.

01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:51.603
That's the thing,
I'm not a stranger.

01:36:51.760 --> 01:36:53.649
No, no, no, we've met before.
Oh.

01:36:54.600 --> 01:36:56.682
Summer '94.

01:36:58.640 --> 01:37:01.086
You're mistaking me for someone else.
No.

01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:04.001
We even fell in love.
Really?

01:37:04.160 --> 01:37:05.924
Mm-hm.

01:37:06.160 --> 01:37:09.846
Hm. I vaguely remember
someone sweet and romantic

01:37:10.040 --> 01:37:14.250
who made me feel like I wasn't alone.
Someone who had respect for who I was.

01:37:14.400 --> 01:37:17.210
That's me. I'm that guy.

01:37:18.080 --> 01:37:19.650
I don't think so.
Oh.

01:37:19.840 --> 01:37:23.003
See, I know something about
tonight that you don't know.

01:37:23.760 --> 01:37:25.000
Really? What is that?

01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:27.801
Something important.

01:37:28.120 --> 01:37:33.206
You see, I know because I've actually
already lived through this night.

01:37:33.400 --> 01:37:35.846
How?
I'm a time traveler.

01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:38.726
Okay.

01:37:38.920 --> 01:37:43.642
No, I have a time machine in my room. I've
come to save you, like I said I would.

01:37:43.840 --> 01:37:47.686
Save me from what?
From being blinded by the bullshit of life.

01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:49.126
It's not bullshit.

01:37:49.320 --> 01:37:52.085
I assure you,
that guy you vaguely remember,

01:37:52.280 --> 01:37:55.204
the sweet romantic one
that you met on a train?

01:37:56.440 --> 01:37:57.601
That is me.

01:37:58.200 --> 01:38:00.123
That's you?
Yeah.

01:38:00.320 --> 01:38:03.210
Guess I didn't recognize you.
Hm.

01:38:03.840 --> 01:38:05.205
You look like shit.

01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:10.122
What can I say? I mean,
it's tough out there in time and space.

01:38:10.320 --> 01:38:13.244
You, on the other hand,

01:38:13.440 --> 01:38:16.330
are even more beautiful
than I remember.

01:38:17.320 --> 01:38:18.446
Bullshit.

01:38:18.640 --> 01:38:20.608
Jesse, this is not a game.

01:38:20.760 --> 01:38:25.288
You get all cute, you get in my panties.
And next thing I know, I'm in Chicago.

01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:27.807
Not gonna make it better
by some pick-up line.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.924
I'm not trying to pick you up.
No, you misunderstand me.

01:38:31.120 --> 01:38:33.930
No, no, no.
I'm only here as a messenger.

01:38:34.120 --> 01:38:37.408
I've just traveled all the way
from the future.

01:38:37.640 --> 01:38:41.850
I was just with
your 82-year-old self

01:38:42.040 --> 01:38:45.567
who gave me a letter
to read to you.

01:38:45.760 --> 01:38:47.125
So here I am.

01:38:47.640 --> 01:38:49.483
I'm still alive in my 80's?

01:38:49.680 --> 01:38:52.490
Oh, yeah.
Mm-hm.

01:38:52.640 --> 01:38:54.881
How's my French ass?
Nice.

01:38:55.080 --> 01:38:57.048
Okay.
Really nice.

01:38:57.280 --> 01:39:00.921
I don't care about the way I look.
There's more of you to love.

01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:03.162
Great.
You want me to read it to you?

01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:06.204
Do I have a choice?
Sure. If you're not interested...

01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:07.646
No, no, no.

01:39:07.840 --> 01:39:11.162
Read it.
Okay. All right. Well, here it is.

01:39:11.360 --> 01:39:16.446
"Dear Celine, I am writing to you
from the other side of the woods."

01:39:16.640 --> 01:39:20.122
"This letter is lighting a candle that will..."
Okay, stop it.

01:39:20.320 --> 01:39:23.847
I would never write this.
"Other side of the woods." What woods?

01:39:24.040 --> 01:39:26.202
May I please continue?
Okay.

01:39:26.400 --> 01:39:29.324
"I am sending you this young man."

01:39:29.560 --> 01:39:30.971
"Yes, young."

01:39:31.160 --> 01:39:34.369
"And he will be your escort."

01:39:34.560 --> 01:39:38.724
"God knows he has many problems
and has struggled his whole life

01:39:38.920 --> 01:39:44.290
connecting and being present,
even with those he loves the most."

01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:47.484
"And for that he is deeply sorry."

01:39:48.520 --> 01:39:50.443
"But you are his only hope."

01:39:52.040 --> 01:39:55.965
"Celine, my advice to you is this."

01:39:56.600 --> 01:39:59.126
"You're entering the best years
of your life."

01:39:59.320 --> 01:40:02.210
"Looking back from where I sit now,

01:40:03.160 --> 01:40:06.403
these middle years
are only a little bit more difficult

01:40:06.640 --> 01:40:08.324
than when you were 12

01:40:08.560 --> 01:40:12.451
and Mathieu and Vanessa
danced all night

01:40:12.640 --> 01:40:15.211
to the Bee Gees'
'How Deep Is Your Love."'

01:40:15.440 --> 01:40:17.568
"I don't know about that. Anyway."

01:40:17.760 --> 01:40:19.922
"Celine, you will be fine."

01:40:20.120 --> 01:40:24.205
"Your girls will grow up to become
examples and icons of feminism."

01:40:24.360 --> 01:40:26.249
Nice one.
Yeah.

01:40:26.440 --> 01:40:30.126
I just noticed there's a postscript
at the bottom. Looks important.

01:40:30.320 --> 01:40:32.322
Maybe I should skip over
some of this.

01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:34.284
Yeah, skip away. Please.
Okay.

01:40:34.480 --> 01:40:36.164
You sure? Yeah, okay, yeah.

01:40:36.360 --> 01:40:37.964
All right.
Boring stuff.

01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:42.802
Yeah. Okay. Yeah, it's like,
blah, blah, blah, financial tips,

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.446
horoscope stuff. Okay, here it is.

01:40:45.680 --> 01:40:50.208
"P.S. By the way, the best..." Oh.

01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:56.366
"By the way, the best sex of my life
happened one night

01:40:56.560 --> 01:40:59.325
in the southern Peloponnese."

01:40:59.520 --> 01:41:01.443
"Don't miss it."

01:41:01.640 --> 01:41:07.249
"My whole sexual being went
to a new, ground-breaking level."

01:41:07.440 --> 01:41:10.364
Ground-breaking. Great.
I don't know what that means.

01:41:10.560 --> 01:41:13.291
Okay, Jesse, can you
stop this stupid game?

01:41:13.720 --> 01:41:17.327
We're not in one of
your stories. Okay?

01:41:17.680 --> 01:41:21.924
Did you hear what I said to you
back in the room? Did you hear me?

01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:25.609
Yes, I heard you.

01:41:26.320 --> 01:41:28.926
What, that
you don't love me anymore?

01:41:29.640 --> 01:41:33.326
I figured you didn't mean it,
but if you did, then, uh...

01:41:33.880 --> 01:41:38.169
Oh, fuck it. Know something? You're just
like the little girls and everybody else.

01:41:38.400 --> 01:41:40.402
You wanna live inside
some fairy tale.

01:41:40.600 --> 01:41:42.762
I'm just trying to
make things better.

01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:45.725
I tell you I love you,
I tell you you're beautiful,

01:41:45.880 --> 01:41:48.963
I tell you that your ass looks great
when you're 80.

01:41:49.240 --> 01:41:50.401
Huh?

01:41:50.640 --> 01:41:53.769
I'm trying to make you laugh.
Okay.

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:57.209
All right, I put up
with plenty of your shit.

01:41:57.560 --> 01:42:01.770
And if you think I'm just some dog who's
gonna keep coming back, you're wrong.

01:42:01.960 --> 01:42:05.851
But if you want true love,
then this is it.

01:42:06.040 --> 01:42:08.884
This is real life.
It's not perfect, but it's real.

01:42:09.080 --> 01:42:13.210
And if you can't see it, then you're
blind, all right, and I give up.

01:42:21.840 --> 01:42:24.047
Oh, God.

01:42:51.280 --> 01:42:53.806
So, what about
this time machine?

01:42:57.040 --> 01:42:58.883
What do you mean?

01:42:59.120 --> 01:43:01.088
How does it work?

01:43:02.800 --> 01:43:05.007
Well, it's complicated.

01:43:08.720 --> 01:43:11.963
Am I gonna have to
get naked to operate it?

01:43:14.480 --> 01:43:15.811
I mean...

01:43:16.040 --> 01:43:19.647
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's actually...
It's been a real issue, you know?

01:43:19.880 --> 01:43:24.408
I mean, I... Clothes, they don't travel well
through the whole space-time continuum.

01:43:24.600 --> 01:43:26.125
It's...

01:43:27.840 --> 01:43:29.922
Wow. You're so smart.

01:43:30.080 --> 01:43:32.128
Ha, ha. Oh, jeez.

01:43:32.320 --> 01:43:35.529
Space-time...?
Continuum.

01:43:36.120 --> 01:43:39.841
Continuum.
Yeah. Really.

01:43:40.400 --> 01:43:43.961
There's something that I've been
thinking about, about your letter.

01:43:44.160 --> 01:43:46.242
Yeah?
You know, you, uh...

01:43:46.440 --> 01:43:49.205

Peloponnese?

01:43:49.400 --> 01:43:52.643
Yeah, yeah, and we're
in the southern Peloponnese.

01:43:52.800 --> 01:43:53.926
Mm-hm.

01:43:54.120 --> 01:43:56.566
Yeah, and do you think
it could be tonight

01:43:56.760 --> 01:43:59.969
that you're still talking about
in your 80's?

01:44:00.240 --> 01:44:01.810
Well...

01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:06.647
it must have been one hell
of a night we're about to have.

01:44:07.305 --> 01:44:13.486
