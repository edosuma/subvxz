previously on dark matter.

00:01.769 --> 00:02.768
[three]
who are you?

00:02.770 --> 00:04.236
[both]
i don't know.

00:04.238 --> 00:05.004
Who are you?

00:05.006 --> 00:06.438
I got no idea.

00:06.440 --> 00:09.108
[one] we all woke up
just like you no idea who we are

00:09.110 --> 00:10.175
Or how we got here.

00:10.177 --> 00:11.677
[two] she's an
android.

00:11.678 --> 00:13.178
[the android] we're on course
for a nearby inhabited world.

00:13.180 --> 00:15.147
[mireille]
well you're welcome to resupply

00:15.149 --> 00:17.750
And help yourself to whatever
you need then you best be off.

00:17.752 --> 00:19.485
[six]
why is that?

00:19.486 --> 00:21.219
You wanna be long gone
before the raza get here.

00:21.222 --> 00:22.638
The raza?

00:22.639 --> 00:24.055
Obviously we were meant
to help these people.

00:24.058 --> 00:26.058
The raza is the
name of this ship.

00:26.060 --> 00:27.659
We're not here to
help these people.

00:27.661 --> 00:29.194
We're here to kill them.

00:30.765 --> 00:33.365
No.

00:33.367 --> 00:36.101
That's impossible.

00:36.103 --> 00:37.569
That can't be right.

00:37.571 --> 00:39.271
Can it?

00:39.272 --> 00:40.972
[android]
i recovered the information from

00:40.973 --> 00:42.673
A fragment of the ship's logs
related to the crew list.

00:42.676 --> 00:44.510
There's no reason to doubt its
veracity.

00:44.512 --> 00:45.677
[two]
of course not.

00:45.679 --> 00:47.679
In fact, it all makes
perfect sense now

00:47.681 --> 00:48.480
The raza--

00:48.482 --> 00:50.838
This ship.

00:50.839 --> 00:53.195
But as far as the
miners are concerned:

00:53.196 --> 00:55.552
A race of bloodthirsty aliens--
monsters, come to wipe them out.

00:55.556 --> 00:58.424
[six] but truth is
we're nothing but a bunch of
low-life mercenaries.

00:58.426 --> 01:02.061
[three]
no, we're better than that.

01:02.063 --> 01:05.064
We're also pirates and
smugglers and thieves,

01:05.066 --> 01:06.298
It's a very diversified
portfolio.

01:06.300 --> 01:07.733
You think this is funny?

01:07.735 --> 01:11.637
It's my defense mechanism:
Humor.

01:11.639 --> 01:14.406
That and, apparently, killing
people.

01:14.408 --> 01:17.142
I think we need to
talk about our next move.

01:17.144 --> 01:19.161
Well he's right you know.

01:19.162 --> 01:21.179
Oh listen i don't wanna
be the one to say it,

01:21.182 --> 01:24.316
But if all this stuff is true,
we came here to do a job.

01:24.318 --> 01:26.485
You want to go down to the
planet and kill those people?

01:26.487 --> 01:27.987
No one's killing anyone.

01:27.988 --> 01:29.488
[three] i didn't
say i wanted to kill anyone.

01:29.490 --> 01:32.157
I'm just talking about
the people who hired us.

01:32.159 --> 01:33.826
Ferrous corp.Oration.

01:33.828 --> 01:35.094
Galactic combine.

01:35.096 --> 01:36.528
Exactly.

01:36.530 --> 01:40.299
Not the sort of folks you
wanna disappoint, i'm guessing.

01:40.301 --> 01:41.433
Too bad.

01:41.435 --> 01:43.202
I'm no murderer.

01:43.204 --> 01:45.270
[three] it's funny
cause the screen says otherwise.

01:45.272 --> 01:46.839
Yeah, i don't care what it says.

01:46.841 --> 01:49.708
So have you managed to
uncover anything else?

01:49.710 --> 01:52.377
Unfortunately, the rest
of the data was corrupted.

01:52.379 --> 01:53.846
Well, i suppose that's plenty.

01:53.848 --> 01:56.615
Hell of a lot more than
i wanted to know anyways.

01:56.617 --> 01:59.685
[four]
we all wanted to know.

01:59.687 --> 02:01.653
These are the memories
we left behind,

02:01.655 --> 02:05.757
Death, despair, chaos.

02:05.759 --> 02:07.192
So what?

02:07.194 --> 02:09.461
If they're no longer a part of
us now

02:09.463 --> 02:11.263
Then what does it even matter?

02:25.579 --> 02:26.812
Yeah.

02:31.919 --> 02:35.187
Should i continue my
attempts at data recovery?

02:36.357 --> 02:37.422
Portia?

02:37.424 --> 02:43.162
Don't... Don't call me that.

02:43.164 --> 02:46.932
No computer file is
going to tell me who i am.

02:46.934 --> 02:48.901
Call me two.

02:53.340 --> 02:54.740
Okay two.

02:55.809 --> 03:05.651
¶ music playing ¶

03:21.802 --> 03:23.902
[das/five gasps]

03:23.904 --> 03:25.170
[android]
i'm sorry.

03:25.171 --> 03:26.437
I didn't mean to startle you.

03:26.440 --> 03:27.773
You didn't startle me.

03:27.775 --> 03:30.209
You scared the crap
out of me sneaking up like that.

03:30.211 --> 03:32.511
My stealth subroutines
are very efficient.

03:32.513 --> 03:34.346
Well dial them back--

03:34.348 --> 03:36.848
Or say something next
time you walk into a room.

03:43.657 --> 03:45.524
[android] are you
afraid of them now?

03:45.526 --> 03:47.226
[das]
you think i should be?

03:47.227 --> 03:48.927
They show a history of
violence, mental instability,

03:48.929 --> 03:50.862
Extreme anti-social
behavior, deceit--

03:50.864 --> 03:52.831
What's important is
who they are now.

03:52.833 --> 03:54.733
An admirable attitude.

03:54.735 --> 03:57.569
Also, potentially a very
foolish and dangerous one.

03:57.571 --> 04:00.505
Hey, you're the one
who tried to kill us.

04:00.507 --> 04:01.873
The result of a
programmed directive

04:01.875 --> 04:03.609
That has since been deleted.

04:03.611 --> 04:06.378
Same with them maybe, right?

04:09.416 --> 04:12.584
If it's not fear,
then why are you upset?

04:12.586 --> 04:14.987
What makes you
think i'm upset?

04:14.989 --> 04:17.289
I can see a muscular tension
in your jaw and shoulders.

04:17.291 --> 04:18.490
I can hear a slight increase

04:18.491 --> 04:19.690
In both respiratory rate
and heart rate.

04:19.693 --> 04:21.260
I can smell a distinct shift
in pheromone production--

04:21.262 --> 04:23.328
Okay, okay. I get it.

04:27.501 --> 04:31.303
Look, if you want to know...

04:31.305 --> 04:35.340
...It's because i'm the only
one who's not in the files.

04:35.342 --> 04:36.975
I'm not one of the crew.

04:36.977 --> 04:41.780
So... How did i get
onboard this ship?

04:41.782 --> 04:45.717
At least they know
they belong here.

04:45.719 --> 04:48.687
I'm still just
a big question mark.

04:48.689 --> 04:51.990
[das/five sighs]

04:51.992 --> 04:53.759
There may come a time when
you'll consider yourself lucky

04:53.761 --> 04:56.895
Not to be counted
as a member of this crew.

04:56.897 --> 05:01.600
Well right now, i just wish
i was part of the team.

05:06.440 --> 05:11.410
Oh, and one more thing, maybe
don't go around telling people

05:11.412 --> 05:14.846
You can smell
their pheromones.

05:14.848 --> 05:17.049
It's not gonna
win you any friends.

05:21.388 --> 05:22.688
But i can smell them.

05:23.490 --> 05:24.690
[six]
weapons array, sensors,

05:24.692 --> 05:27.025
Navigation and
critical controls.

05:27.027 --> 05:31.330
Flip these, punch that,
hit these two

05:31.332 --> 05:33.899
And you bring
the engines online.

05:33.901 --> 05:36.368
[three] how do you
know how to fly this thing?

05:36.370 --> 05:38.837
I don't know, i just do.

05:39.640 --> 05:40.739
Huh.

05:40.741 --> 05:42.107
Maybe you do too.

05:42.109 --> 05:43.375
You gotta try it.

05:43.377 --> 05:46.712
[straining] yep...
Wait a minute... That's it.

05:46.714 --> 05:47.813
[air decompressing]
[alarm sounding]

05:47.815 --> 05:50.716
Oh... No, no, no.
Maybe not.

05:50.718 --> 05:52.351
[sighs in frustration]

05:52.353 --> 05:54.119
You know i just
can't concentrate

05:54.120 --> 05:55.886
This whole thing's got
me thinking, that's all.

05:55.889 --> 05:59.024
Yeah, tell me about it.

05:59.026 --> 06:01.927
Which one of us do you
think's got the baddest rep?

06:01.929 --> 06:03.979
What?

06:03.980 --> 06:06.030
Yeah i mean, just based on
what we know about each other,

06:06.033 --> 06:08.734
Which is not a lot
to go on i know,

06:08.736 --> 06:11.036
How would you rank us in
order of most wanted,

06:11.038 --> 06:13.805
From like "super bad-ass"
all the way on down

06:13.807 --> 06:16.942
To "cause for concern."

06:16.944 --> 06:19.811
For instance,
i'd put me in first spot,

06:19.813 --> 06:21.613
You'd slide right there in seco.

06:21.615 --> 06:24.850
Boss lady well she'd be third
on account of her ba'ttitude

06:24.852 --> 06:26.852
And then ol' slashy stabberson .

06:26.854 --> 06:29.921
Pretty boy and the kid
tied for last place

06:29.923 --> 06:32.691
Cause it looks like she's
got a bit of a temper.

06:32.693 --> 06:34.025
You being serious?

06:34.027 --> 06:35.861
You'd rate her higher?

06:35.863 --> 06:37.729
Yeah... Maybe.

06:37.731 --> 06:39.064
This doesn't bother you at all?

06:39.066 --> 06:40.755
What?

06:40.756 --> 06:42.445
The fact that we're
wanted criminals?

06:42.446 --> 06:44.135
That if we get caught we'll
spend the rest of our lives

06:44.138 --> 06:45.670
Locked away, if we're lucky?

06:45.672 --> 06:46.972
The fact that from hereon in,

06:46.974 --> 06:49.975
We'll be the targets
of our former victims

06:49.977 --> 06:52.043
Their friends loved ones
and anyone else looking

06:52.045 --> 06:55.013
To cash in on our bounties,
none of whom, by the way,

06:55.015 --> 06:56.782
We'll see coming because
we don't remember

06:56.784 --> 06:59.518
A thing past yesterday.

06:59.520 --> 07:01.486
Not really.

07:02.623 --> 07:03.955
No-no-no-no-no-no.
Don't-don't-don't don't.

07:19.706 --> 07:20.939
I've been thinking...

07:20.940 --> 07:22.173
Yeah, that's something you
need to get under control.

07:22.176 --> 07:24.576
Those weapons in the cargo hold,

07:24.578 --> 07:27.179
The matching pendants,
at first, i thought it meant

07:27.181 --> 07:28.814
We were the ones who were
supposed to help the miners--

07:28.816 --> 07:30.916
That we were their saviors.

07:30.918 --> 07:32.651
But now i'm wondering if it
means we killed their saviors

07:32.653 --> 07:33.752
And heisted the delivery.

07:33.754 --> 07:35.304
Your point?

07:35.305 --> 07:36.855
If i'm right, ferrous corp..
Isn't gonna let this go.

07:36.857 --> 07:39.624
If we don't finish the job,
they'll just send someone else.

07:39.626 --> 07:41.626
Which is why we
stick to the plan.

07:41.628 --> 07:44.129
The miners get half the
weapons, and a fighting chance.

07:44.131 --> 07:45.130
We can do more.

07:45.132 --> 07:46.131
Go all the way.

07:46.133 --> 07:47.666
Commit to something.

07:47.668 --> 07:48.967
We can fight with them.

07:48.969 --> 07:50.068
That would be suicide.

07:50.070 --> 07:51.803
Not necessarily.

07:51.804 --> 07:53.537
Look if half of what's
in those files is true,

07:53.540 --> 07:56.074
Then we can
handle ourselves.

07:56.076 --> 07:58.460
It also means you could
spend the rest of your life

07:58.461 --> 08:00.845
Doing good deeds and not even
come close to making up for it.

08:00.848 --> 08:03.482
I know what you're trying to
do, and it's not going to work.

08:03.484 --> 08:06.051
You don't want to believe what
those files say you are, fair e.

08:06.053 --> 08:08.053
I don't much want to either.

08:08.055 --> 08:09.754
But i'm not gonna kill myself

08:09.756 --> 08:12.858
Trying to make up for crimes
i don't even remember committin.

08:12.860 --> 08:16.761
We stick to the plan.

08:16.763 --> 08:18.797
And who made you
team leader?

08:18.799 --> 08:20.832
I did by stepping up.

08:20.834 --> 08:23.902
And so did all of you by not
challenging me when i did.

08:23.904 --> 08:26.671
Unless... Unless you've
had a change of heart

08:26.673 --> 08:29.174
And think you
can do a better job?

08:30.644 --> 08:32.711
Didn't think so.

08:36.783 --> 08:38.183
[jace corso/one sighs]

08:40.787 --> 08:42.821
[six]
try that, is it on?

08:42.823 --> 08:43.688
[one]
yeah.

08:43.690 --> 08:44.789
[six]
okay.

08:44.791 --> 08:46.024
[three]
seriously...

08:46.026 --> 08:48.260
[four]
yeah?

08:48.262 --> 08:49.978
...What's with the sword?

08:49.979 --> 08:51.695
It's quicker, more effective
in close quarter combat.

08:51.698 --> 08:52.964
More effective than a gun?

08:52.966 --> 08:55.066
Without a doubt.

08:55.068 --> 08:58.703
You think you could
outdraw me with that thing?

08:58.705 --> 09:02.741
I would have your head cut off
before you could even unholster.

09:03.977 --> 09:06.211
Hey.

09:06.213 --> 09:08.013
I need to talk to you.

09:08.015 --> 09:10.048
Ohh.

09:21.662 --> 09:27.265
[two] look, i may have been
a little hard on you before.

09:27.267 --> 09:29.034
Believe me,
i know how you feel.

09:29.036 --> 09:32.270
We all do.

09:32.272 --> 09:34.339
But 10 minutes after finding
out you used to be a villain

09:34.341 --> 09:37.042
Is not the time
to try to be a hero.

09:37.044 --> 09:38.810
There is no room
for independent action.

09:38.812 --> 09:41.112
We need to stick together
and watch each others' backs.

09:41.114 --> 09:43.248
Do you understand
what i'm saying?

09:43.250 --> 09:46.618
I... Think so.

09:46.620 --> 09:49.988
Once the weapons are delivered
and that shuttle comes back,

09:49.990 --> 09:51.289
I want you on it.

09:51.291 --> 09:53.725
Understood?

09:53.727 --> 09:57.095
Yeah.

09:57.097 --> 09:59.064
Alright.

09:59.066 --> 10:00.832
Safe flight.

10:06.006 --> 10:08.206
And stop staring at my ass.

10:29.363 --> 10:33.164
[mireille] hey, i'm sorry
we couldn't do more for you.

10:33.166 --> 10:36.001
It's just we gave everything
we had to hrothgar.

10:36.003 --> 10:38.703
[one]
don't worry about it.

10:38.705 --> 10:41.172
Well, what are you gonna
tell your employer?

10:41.174 --> 10:43.208
I mean how are you
going to explain--

10:43.210 --> 10:46.144
Intergalactic transport's
a risky business.

10:46.146 --> 10:49.280
Cargo gets misplaced
or stolen all the time.

10:49.282 --> 10:53.184
Insurance'll cover it.

10:53.186 --> 10:56.154
You're good people.

10:56.156 --> 10:58.957
No, we're not.

10:58.959 --> 11:01.076
Of course you are.

11:01.077 --> 11:03.194
You've helped us-- i mean
you probably saved our lives.

11:03.196 --> 11:05.897
I'm beginning to think
it's just the opposite.

11:05.899 --> 11:07.666
By giving you these weapons,

11:07.668 --> 11:10.402
I'm afraid we're just
giving you false hope.

11:13.707 --> 11:18.877
Look... You can't win this.

11:18.879 --> 11:21.279
If you stay here
and fight, you'll die.

11:21.281 --> 11:22.847
But i'm hoping it's
not gonna come to that.

11:22.849 --> 11:24.883
We have help coming,
and more weapons.

11:24.885 --> 11:26.351
[three]
that's the spirit.

11:26.353 --> 11:28.386
Don't let the bastards
get you down.

11:28.388 --> 11:32.724
As for us, we gotta
get back to our spaceship.

11:32.726 --> 11:34.125
[woman] not yet.

11:34.127 --> 11:35.994
At least allow us to thank you.

11:35.996 --> 11:39.964
That bloodthirsty look
in your eyes is all the thanks .

11:39.966 --> 11:43.268
With song and drink!

11:43.270 --> 11:46.304
Well, who doesn't
love a good song huh?

11:46.306 --> 11:49.040
Oh!

11:49.042 --> 11:50.809
Well.

11:59.453 --> 12:01.953
[keypad beeping]

12:01.955 --> 12:03.121
[five]
oh, hey.

12:03.122 --> 12:04.288
I took another look
at that console on the bridge,

12:04.291 --> 12:05.990
But i think it's really fried.

12:05.992 --> 12:08.126
At least until we can
get some spare parts.

12:08.128 --> 12:10.028
Sorry.

12:10.030 --> 12:11.796
Yeah that's okay.

12:11.798 --> 12:14.866
Hey, can i ask
you something?

12:14.868 --> 12:16.401
I know you didn't exactly

12:16.402 --> 12:17.935
Get the answers
you were looking for,

12:17.938 --> 12:19.871
But if you could go back
to when we first woke up,

12:19.873 --> 12:24.442
And not know, would you?

12:24.444 --> 12:26.177
[two sighs heavily]

12:26.179 --> 12:29.013
I suppose i might.

12:29.015 --> 12:32.016
But i have a feeling that not
knowing would just make me

12:32.018 --> 12:35.019
Want to know all over again.

12:35.021 --> 12:38.356
Well, i guess the next big
mystery that needs solving

12:38.358 --> 12:41.259
Is who stole our memories.

12:41.261 --> 12:42.861
No one stole
our memories.

12:42.863 --> 12:44.929
It was an accident.

12:46.433 --> 12:48.166
No it wasn't.

12:49.503 --> 12:51.870
[android] two, you need
to come to the bridge immediate.

12:59.513 --> 13:00.979
[two sighs]
what is it?

13:00.981 --> 13:02.046
Another ship.

13:02.048 --> 13:04.048
It's just dropped out of ftl.

13:04.050 --> 13:05.550
Who is it?

13:05.552 --> 13:07.819
Ferrous corp.Oration destroyer.

13:18.131 --> 13:19.397
They've already
launched a shuttle.

13:19.399 --> 13:20.999
It's headed towards
the planet's surface.

13:21.001 --> 13:23.334
We've got to get
our people off that planet.

13:23.336 --> 13:25.336
Did you contact
the marauder and warn them?

13:25.338 --> 13:27.205
I attempted communication
but received no response.

13:27.207 --> 13:28.506
Shit.

13:28.508 --> 13:29.758
[communication device beeping]

13:29.759 --> 13:31.009
We're being hailed
by the other ship.

13:31.011 --> 13:32.076
Would you like me to--?

13:32.078 --> 13:33.044
Ignore it.

13:33.046 --> 13:34.546
Marauder, this is the raza.

13:34.548 --> 13:36.915
You've got trouble
headed your way.

13:36.917 --> 13:38.216
[radio static]

13:38.218 --> 13:40.819
[two] marauder, do you read?
[radio static continues]

13:43.023 --> 13:45.089
[drinks clanking]
[marcus boone/threel laughing]

13:45.091 --> 13:49.494
[cheering]

13:51.097 --> 13:53.097
We drink their drink,
eat their food,

13:53.099 --> 13:55.533
And then just...
Leave them here to die.

13:55.535 --> 13:57.302
[six] hey, if
you've got another suggestion

13:57.304 --> 14:00.338
That doesn't involve us dying
here with them, i'd love to hea.

14:00.340 --> 14:02.106
Maybe we should
tell them the truth.

14:02.108 --> 14:03.875
What that we're mercenaries
sent here to kill them?

14:03.877 --> 14:05.877
They should know
that no more help is coming.

14:05.879 --> 14:07.045
It won't make a difference.

14:07.047 --> 14:07.846
Maybe not.

14:07.848 --> 14:09.247
But we might.

14:09.249 --> 14:11.583
Don't even think about it.

14:11.584 --> 14:13.918
We're very, very bad people
who've some very bad things,

14:13.920 --> 14:17.188
This is our chance to put
our unique skill set to good us.

14:17.190 --> 14:19.891
We stand alongside these miners
and, when ferrous corp. Comes,

14:19.893 --> 14:21.459
We hurt them,
hurt them so bad

14:21.461 --> 14:24.195
They think twice about
bothering with this planet.

14:24.197 --> 14:26.331
[griffin jones/six chuckles]
[one] what?!

14:26.333 --> 14:29.000
You're nothing
if not predictable.

14:29.002 --> 14:32.103
Two told me you'd say all of th,
practically word for word.

14:32.105 --> 14:34.105
She also said
to do whatever it takes

14:34.107 --> 14:36.691
To bring you back with us,

14:36.692 --> 14:39.276
Including knocking you out
and dragging you back if i have.

14:39.279 --> 14:41.112
Really?

14:41.114 --> 14:44.148
She did ask me not to hit
you in the face though.

14:44.150 --> 14:45.283
[thomas]
ferrous corp. Is here!

14:45.285 --> 14:46.618
Ferrous corp. Is here!

14:46.620 --> 14:48.186
Go, go!

14:50.257 --> 14:51.322
Hey!

14:54.027 --> 14:55.460
Marauder, this is the raza.

14:55.462 --> 14:56.862
Are you there?

14:56.863 --> 14:58.263
We might consider the
possibility that they've already

14:58.265 --> 15:01.099
Encountered
the ferrous corp. Shuttle.

15:01.101 --> 15:03.034
Patch me through
to the destroyer.

15:03.904 --> 15:05.470
Done.

15:07.140 --> 15:08.306
This is the raza.

15:08.308 --> 15:11.442
Please, respond.

15:11.444 --> 15:12.944
This is the raza.

15:12.946 --> 15:14.445
Please respond.

15:14.447 --> 15:17.415
This is commander nieman
of the fcs deliverance.

15:17.417 --> 15:18.349
Took you long enough.

15:18.351 --> 15:19.701
Apologies.

15:19.702 --> 15:21.052
What can i do
for you, commander?

15:21.054 --> 15:23.288
Well you can start by telling me
what the hell is going on?

15:23.290 --> 15:24.589
Why you didn't
complete your mission

15:24.591 --> 15:26.357
Or update us on your status?

15:26.359 --> 15:28.660
There were some complications
we had to contend with

15:28.662 --> 15:30.361
But we have everything
under control now.

15:30.363 --> 15:32.997
Please have your shuttle fall b.

15:32.999 --> 15:34.716
Negative, raza.

15:34.717 --> 15:36.434
Contingency plans have been ena.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.336
Again, that won't be
necessary, deliverance.

15:38.338 --> 15:39.304
This is our show.

15:39.306 --> 15:41.372
Not anymore it's not.

15:41.374 --> 15:43.308
Raza, i'm on my way over.

15:51.484 --> 15:53.434
[warning gun fire]

15:53.435 --> 15:55.385
[nassan]
that's far enough!

15:55.388 --> 15:56.721
[guns click]

15:56.722 --> 15:58.055
[man] is that any way to act,

15:58.058 --> 16:00.458
After ferrous corp. Made you
such a generous offer?!

16:00.460 --> 16:02.026
Generous?!

16:02.028 --> 16:04.495
You'd turn us into
slaves on our own land!

16:04.497 --> 16:07.565
One last chance to reconsider!

16:07.567 --> 16:10.068
[one]
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

16:10.070 --> 16:13.571
Hold on! Hold on!
Hold on, please!

16:13.573 --> 16:15.306
Hold up.

16:19.012 --> 16:21.012
No one wants a fight here.

16:21.014 --> 16:23.614
You had a job to do, corso.

16:23.616 --> 16:25.249
[jace corso/one panting]

16:25.251 --> 16:27.318
Well, we took some time
to think things through

16:27.320 --> 16:31.522
And decided on a change of plan.

16:31.524 --> 16:33.324
Take your men and leave.

16:33.326 --> 16:36.227
Tell your bosses
we're with these people now.

16:36.229 --> 16:37.628
You can't be serious.

16:37.630 --> 16:39.130
What did they offer you?

16:39.132 --> 16:40.398
You know us.

16:40.400 --> 16:43.134
You know what we're capable of.

16:43.136 --> 16:45.269
Think of the losses.

16:45.271 --> 16:48.439
It's not worth it.

16:48.441 --> 16:51.275
Find another planet.

16:51.277 --> 16:54.145
It's not my call.

16:54.147 --> 16:57.382
I'll have to
take this upstairs.

17:00.453 --> 17:02.353
Fair enough.

17:06.259 --> 17:13.698
[semi-automatic guns firing]
rat-tat-tat-tat

17:13.700 --> 17:15.466
[man painfully yelps]

17:16.302 --> 17:20.672
(guns firing)

17:20.673 --> 17:25.043
[shotgun blasts]
bam-bam-bam

17:25.045 --> 17:26.344
We're under fire!

17:26.346 --> 17:29.147
I repeat, we're under fire!

17:29.149 --> 17:31.716
The mercs have turned,
they're with the miners now!

17:31.718 --> 17:33.418
We need back up!

17:33.420 --> 17:34.685
Shut the hell up.

17:47.767 --> 17:50.168
That actually went better
than i thought it would.

17:57.610 --> 17:59.143
[android]
the shuttle is approaching.

18:00.280 --> 18:01.145
Go.

18:01.147 --> 18:02.430
Hide.

18:02.431 --> 18:03.714
And don't come out
until we tell you it's safe.

18:03.716 --> 18:05.850
Go!

18:05.852 --> 18:10.421
The shuttle is
within weapons range.

18:10.423 --> 18:12.223
We have an advantage
with speed and maneuverability.

18:12.225 --> 18:15.560
But this ship is still
far from fully operational.

19:09.215 --> 19:11.883
Welcome aboard.

19:17.390 --> 19:19.857
[nassan]
hey, you're gonna be fine, here.

19:19.859 --> 19:21.792
[mirelle]
okay. You have medical training?

19:21.794 --> 19:24.362
[six]
uh, yeah... I guess so.

19:24.364 --> 19:25.429
That's great.

19:25.431 --> 19:27.198
We could really
use your expertise.

19:27.200 --> 19:28.699
[three]
nope.

19:28.701 --> 19:29.867
We can't stay.

19:29.869 --> 19:32.870
[one]
of course we can.

19:32.872 --> 19:35.406
Just long enough
to help the injured.

19:35.408 --> 19:36.741
We're leavin right now.

19:36.743 --> 19:38.209
You selfish son-of-a--

19:38.211 --> 19:39.343
[six]
he's right.

19:39.345 --> 19:41.345
It's a long hike
back to the marauder

19:41.347 --> 19:43.414
And there could be
more of them out there.

19:43.416 --> 19:46.317
Wait a minute,
you're going to abandon us?

19:46.319 --> 19:49.187
You got your weapons,
staying was never part of the d.

19:49.189 --> 19:50.321
Neither was killing
those soldiers.

19:50.322 --> 19:51.454
But now you're just
going to leave us here

19:51.457 --> 19:53.024
To deal with the fallout!

19:53.025 --> 19:54.592
Friend, the fallout
would've been so much worse

19:54.594 --> 19:57.828
If we hadn't been here
so... You're welcome.

19:57.830 --> 20:01.199
Please, i mean
you've got a shuttle-- a ship.

20:01.201 --> 20:03.301
[one]
that's right.

20:03.302 --> 20:05.402
And they're at your disposal
if any of you want to leave.

20:05.405 --> 20:07.371
Look you stood,
you made your point.

20:07.373 --> 20:09.340
But now it's time to go.

20:09.342 --> 20:12.410
This is a war you can't win.

20:12.412 --> 20:15.446
Please.

20:15.448 --> 20:17.248
You're all a bunch
of cowards.

20:17.250 --> 20:18.282
All of you.

20:18.284 --> 20:20.351
Hagen, that's enough.

20:20.353 --> 20:22.353
This is our battle

20:22.354 --> 20:24.354
We can't expect
anyone else to fight it for us.

20:24.357 --> 20:26.374
These men risked their lives,

20:26.375 --> 20:28.392
Offered more than we had
any right to expect of them.

20:28.394 --> 20:29.460
We have help coming.

20:29.462 --> 20:31.529
When it gets here, we'll be fin.

20:35.301 --> 20:37.368
We appreciate
all you've done for us.

20:42.375 --> 20:44.375
Good luck.

20:56.823 --> 21:10.601
[das/five panting]

21:44.704 --> 21:47.305
[clicks]

21:50.677 --> 21:52.643
[android] so...

21:52.645 --> 21:55.012
Do either of you
possess offspring?

21:59.686 --> 22:01.536
[nieman] you were hired
to do a job.

22:01.537 --> 22:03.387
[two] like i said,
complications arose.

22:03.389 --> 22:04.889
And continue to
do so apparently.

22:04.891 --> 22:06.641
On my way over,

22:06.642 --> 22:08.392
I received word that we
suffered casualties on the plant

22:08.394 --> 22:10.394
Yeah well i'm sorry
to hear that --

22:10.396 --> 22:12.863
And that your team
was responsible.

22:12.865 --> 22:15.032
Ours is a cutthroat business.

22:15.034 --> 22:16.967
In this sector alone
we're competing

22:16.969 --> 22:18.736
With six other multicorp.S
for planetary resources.

22:18.738 --> 22:20.738
Our major rival,
the mikkei combine,

22:20.740 --> 22:22.506
Have been
particularly aggressive.

22:22.508 --> 22:25.042
The discovery of that
tarium vein is a major coup--

22:25.044 --> 22:27.712
One the company seeks
to start exploiting immediately.

22:27.714 --> 22:30.414
That planet is the only
hospitable world in range.

22:30.416 --> 22:32.983
Then maybe you should've
started with the fair offer

22:32.985 --> 22:36.087
Instead of trying to bully
the miners into submission.

22:36.089 --> 22:38.923
I didn't come here to talk
about what we can do for them.

22:38.925 --> 22:43.127
I came here to discuss
what we could do for you.

22:43.129 --> 22:45.396
I'm listening.

22:45.398 --> 22:47.431
You took payment
in advance,

22:47.433 --> 22:49.567
And then failed
to complete the job.

22:49.569 --> 22:51.535
That's bad business.

22:51.537 --> 22:53.104
Lucky for you
i'm feeling generous today.

22:53.106 --> 22:55.072
I'm willing to call it even.

22:55.074 --> 22:56.457
In exchange for?

22:56.458 --> 22:57.841
Turn this ship around
and leave immediately.

22:57.844 --> 22:59.910
That's it?

22:59.912 --> 23:02.457
Just walk away?

23:02.458 --> 23:05.003
What's about to
happen on that planet--

23:05.004 --> 23:07.549
Well, it would be better
if there were no witnesses.

23:07.553 --> 23:08.619
I still have
people down there.

23:08.621 --> 23:09.754
They made their choice.

23:09.755 --> 23:10.888
They opened fire on
ferrous corp. Personnel,

23:10.890 --> 23:13.958
They have to answer for that.

23:13.960 --> 23:17.795
I suggest you don't
make the same mistake.

23:17.797 --> 23:21.532
If it makes it easier,
i'm willing to throw in a bonus.

23:21.534 --> 23:26.670
...Just for you.

23:26.672 --> 23:27.905
How much?

23:39.986 --> 23:42.720
Let's get the hell off this roc.

23:47.794 --> 23:50.761
Uh, we've got a problem.

23:50.763 --> 23:52.813
What?

23:52.814 --> 23:54.864
The ship... It's not there.

23:54.867 --> 23:56.484
What do you mean
"it's not there"?

23:56.485 --> 23:58.102
I'm telling you,
it's not there.

23:58.104 --> 23:59.637
The raza's gone.

24:07.780 --> 24:08.779
[thomas]
i am so sorry.

24:08.781 --> 24:10.798
We lead you into this.

24:10.799 --> 24:12.816
If you hadn't taken the time
to give us those weapons,

24:12.819 --> 24:13.951
You'd never been
caught down here.

24:13.952 --> 24:15.084
We wanted to help.

24:15.087 --> 24:16.454
Still do.

24:16.456 --> 24:18.222
This isn't your fight.

24:18.224 --> 24:19.757
It is now.

24:22.662 --> 24:26.530
Well, i can't tell a man
how to live his life,

24:26.532 --> 24:28.799
I'm not gonna tell
him how to end it.

24:28.801 --> 24:31.101
Okay we could use
some fresh eyes on the perimete.

24:31.103 --> 24:32.903
Patrol's growing mighty thin.

24:32.905 --> 24:34.972
We have no way
to anticipate when or where

24:34.974 --> 24:37.007
This next attack will come.

24:37.009 --> 24:38.943
Maybe there is.

24:41.013 --> 24:42.947
[door creaks open]

24:53.025 --> 24:55.960
Double-crossing us
was a big mistake.

24:55.962 --> 24:59.964
You and your
friends are gonna die.

24:59.966 --> 25:01.632
How?

25:01.634 --> 25:02.266
Tell me.

25:02.268 --> 25:05.636
How are we going to die?

25:05.638 --> 25:08.506
Choking on your own blood.

25:08.508 --> 25:12.009
Could you be more specific?

25:12.011 --> 25:14.845
We're gonna line you up
and shoot the lucky ones.

25:14.847 --> 25:18.983
The rest, like you, we'll gut.

25:18.985 --> 25:20.017
No.

25:20.019 --> 25:22.253
That's not it.

25:22.255 --> 25:24.722
You could have done that
from the beginning.

25:24.724 --> 25:27.024
Stormed this facility,
execute everyone in it.

25:27.026 --> 25:30.194
You have the men; the resources.

25:30.196 --> 25:32.096
But you didn't.

25:32.098 --> 25:35.566
You hired us to do
your dirty work instead.

25:35.568 --> 25:37.968
Plausible deniability.

25:37.970 --> 25:41.939
A mining colony
wiped out by mercenaries,

25:41.941 --> 25:44.942
That's unfortunate,
but it's not surprising.

25:44.944 --> 25:49.113
A mining colony wiped
out by a corp.Oration.

25:49.115 --> 25:52.082
Well, that's scandalous.

25:52.084 --> 25:53.150
We can make a deal--

25:53.152 --> 25:54.668
You want the miners gone,

25:54.669 --> 25:56.185
Without being directly
implicated in their deaths.

25:56.188 --> 25:57.922
And you wouldn't be here unless

25:57.924 --> 26:01.025
You had a plan to make that hap.

26:01.027 --> 26:04.695
If you let me go i can
guarantee your safety.

26:13.806 --> 26:15.873
Look, i don't
know anything.

26:21.080 --> 26:24.181
You were neither
briefed nor given orders?

26:24.183 --> 26:26.717
Just transported down
here to the planet

26:26.719 --> 26:29.887
And expected to improvise?

26:29.889 --> 26:37.261
I can tell you from experience,
torture doesn't work.

26:37.263 --> 26:44.802
Torture is often ineffective,
even counter-productive.

26:44.804 --> 26:54.144
On the other hand, i personally
find it incredibly cathartic.

26:58.217 --> 27:00.067
[one]
that could work.

27:00.068 --> 27:01.918
Of course it could work... Righ.

27:01.921 --> 27:04.788
They plan to target
your reactor,

27:04.790 --> 27:07.224
Trigger a blast that will
level this entire facility.

27:11.664 --> 27:13.330
[thomas]
it's a mark four fusion reactor.

27:13.332 --> 27:15.633
Standard equipment
for a mining community

27:15.635 --> 27:17.835
About 50 years ago.

27:17.836 --> 27:20.036
Nowadays we can hardly find
spare parts to keep it running.

27:20.039 --> 27:23.240
[one] it's the perfect cover:
Outdated technology,

27:23.242 --> 27:25.809
Ill-equipped miners
who don't know what they're doi.

27:25.811 --> 27:27.711
It's an accident
waiting to happen.

27:31.183 --> 27:33.283
We'll never be able
to hold this position.

27:33.285 --> 27:36.220
Not for long, anyways.

27:36.222 --> 27:38.288
At least we'll die fighting.

28:09.722 --> 28:10.320
[keeley]
clear skies.

28:10.322 --> 28:11.155
Good.

28:11.157 --> 28:13.023
Keep us updated.

28:13.025 --> 28:14.291
What's up?

28:17.329 --> 28:18.328
Hey.

28:18.330 --> 28:20.230
I've been thinking.

28:20.232 --> 28:20.998
Yeah?

28:21.000 --> 28:22.132
You're right.

28:22.134 --> 28:23.934
Which one of us?

28:23.936 --> 28:25.102
Both of you.

28:25.104 --> 28:26.103
We're doomed.

28:26.105 --> 28:29.056
Nah, hang on a second.

28:29.057 --> 28:32.008
As much as i'd love to tell you
"i told you so," i don't know.

28:32.011 --> 28:33.777
I kinda like our
chances here guys.

28:33.779 --> 28:35.779
It doesn't matter
how good our defenses are.

28:35.781 --> 28:37.081
At the end of the day,

28:37.083 --> 28:38.482
They got an endless supply
of bodies and bullets.

28:38.484 --> 28:39.867
We don't.

28:39.868 --> 28:41.251
Eventually, they'll wear us dow.

28:41.253 --> 28:44.221
Okay, and what
was i right about?

28:44.223 --> 28:47.725
There might be a way to win thi,
but it's a long shot.

28:47.727 --> 28:49.359
Like you said, we've got
to hit them where it hurts most:

28:49.361 --> 28:50.728
Their bottom line.

28:50.730 --> 28:51.995
Which is what
we're doing here.

28:51.997 --> 28:53.013
No.

28:53.014 --> 28:54.030
Ferrous corp. Doesn't
care about their men.

28:54.033 --> 28:56.467
They'll just get more.

28:56.469 --> 29:00.304
Ships, on the other hand,
are a lot harder to come by.

29:00.306 --> 29:02.873
And a hell of a lot
more expensive.

29:02.875 --> 29:04.742
You saying we
take out their ship?

29:04.744 --> 29:06.143
Yeah.

29:06.145 --> 29:08.279
Oh man.

29:08.280 --> 29:10.414
Well i like the idea in theory,
but it begs the question:

29:10.416 --> 29:12.850
How do we get it down here?

29:12.852 --> 29:14.118
We don't.

29:14.120 --> 29:15.853
We go up there after it.

29:15.855 --> 29:20.758
Or i do anyway,
in the marauder.

29:20.760 --> 29:23.327
I'll target their drive
and that should do it.

29:23.329 --> 29:25.229
Set off a chain
of secondary explosions

29:25.231 --> 29:27.164
That'll rip that ship apart.

29:27.166 --> 29:28.899
And you with it.

29:28.901 --> 29:30.167
Maybe not.

29:30.169 --> 29:31.468
If i punch the marauder's engine

29:31.470 --> 29:32.402
And get clear
of the blast radius--

29:32.404 --> 29:33.971
[one]
that's crazy.

29:33.973 --> 29:35.873
They'll take you down
before you're anywhere near the.

29:35.875 --> 29:37.241
Oh they can try.

29:37.243 --> 29:39.243
No.

29:39.245 --> 29:41.178
We stand together
and we die together.

29:41.180 --> 29:43.147
We can't let you do this.

29:45.151 --> 29:46.950
What?

29:46.952 --> 29:49.219
Hear the guy out.

29:49.221 --> 29:52.956
[six] i know you don't like it,
believe me, i like it even less.

29:52.958 --> 29:55.959
We show we're crazy enough
to take out one of their ships,

29:55.961 --> 29:57.494
Ferrous corp. Will be less incld

29:57.496 --> 30:00.130
To risk another one around here.

30:00.132 --> 30:03.133
Think about it,
you know i'm right.

30:08.307 --> 30:10.307
I regret that i didn't
have the opportunity

30:10.309 --> 30:12.509
To get to know
you better.

30:12.511 --> 30:16.280
I think we could
have been good friends.

30:20.352 --> 30:22.953
Bet you regret not teaching me
how to fly that shuttle now huh.

30:22.955 --> 30:24.221
[three and six laughing]

30:24.223 --> 30:26.156
Do i ever.

30:30.396 --> 30:32.296
Take care of them.

30:32.298 --> 30:34.832
You're the only one on that ship
with a lick of sense.

30:50.416 --> 30:54.518
If we help you, can you
guarantee our safety?

30:58.023 --> 31:00.324
It's bubba time.

31:00.326 --> 31:01.491
Who's bubba?

31:01.493 --> 31:03.527

31:08.133 --> 31:12.002
Ah well this is bubba,
this is lulu, other one's pip.

31:12.004 --> 31:15.505
What do you name the
knife you keep in your boot?

31:15.507 --> 31:17.507
I don't need a knife in my boot.

31:38.530 --> 31:41.231
You were gonna leave us
here to die weren't you.

31:41.233 --> 31:42.466
No.

31:42.468 --> 31:46.270
I can save us all,
if you let me.

31:46.272 --> 31:47.905
You're a liar.

31:47.907 --> 31:51.208
You and your friends
can't save us.

are in violation of galactic
charter.

37:28.280 --> 37:31.514
This planet is an
independent mining colony.

37:31.516 --> 37:34.384
Not anymore it's not.

37:34.386 --> 37:36.353
We had a deal!

37:36.355 --> 37:37.754
I got a better offer.

37:39.891 --> 37:41.958
I'm sorry about nassan.

37:43.362 --> 37:45.528
He was a good leader.

37:45.530 --> 37:49.599
I-i don't really know what
we're gonna do without him.

37:49.601 --> 37:52.369
Someone else will step up.

37:52.371 --> 37:54.871
Yeah.

37:54.873 --> 37:59.609
But you know we could--
we could use some extra help.

37:59.611 --> 38:01.311
Look i know
it's not glamorous,

38:01.313 --> 38:03.880
And i know it's not like
being among the stars but...

38:03.882 --> 38:10.553
You know, there are some things
down here that aren't so bad.

38:10.555 --> 38:15.792
Yeah, i can see that.

38:15.794 --> 38:18.295
I just i think it's nice
to have a place

38:18.297 --> 38:20.563
Where you know you belong.

38:20.565 --> 38:22.632
I know.

38:22.901 --> 38:26.603
For me right now, i think
that place is up on that ship.

38:30.475 --> 38:32.575
[six]
hey.

38:32.577 --> 38:34.611
Lets go!

38:46.925 --> 38:51.661
Good luck.

38:51.663 --> 38:53.596
You too.

39:18.657 --> 39:21.658
I knew ferrous corp. Wasn't
the only player in the galaxy

39:21.660 --> 39:24.461
So, after we jumped,
i had the android plot a course

39:24.463 --> 39:26.046
To the nearest
mikkei outpost.

39:26.047 --> 39:27.630
Once there, i took
the liberty of making a deal

39:27.632 --> 39:28.765
On the miners' behalf.

39:28.767 --> 39:30.567
How much is
mikkei paying?

39:30.569 --> 39:32.869
Nothing.

39:32.871 --> 39:35.071
I gave them
a 99 year lease for free.

39:35.073 --> 39:38.408
[six scoffs] how the hell
does that help the miners?

39:38.410 --> 39:39.676
They'll never
agree to that.

39:39.678 --> 39:40.944
They already have.

39:40.946 --> 39:43.113
They're signing
the deal as we speak.

39:43.115 --> 39:46.082
See, their mistake was trying
to negotiate with one combine.

39:46.084 --> 39:47.851
The only way to
handle these bastards

39:47.853 --> 39:49.619
Is to play them
against each other.

39:49.621 --> 39:52.489
It's a stalemate.

39:52.491 --> 39:55.658
The planet is worthless without
the rights to the asteroid belt,

39:55.660 --> 39:57.160
And the asteroid belt
is worthless

39:57.162 --> 39:59.095
Without the rights
to the planet.

39:59.097 --> 40:01.097
For the price of filing
some legal papers,

40:01.099 --> 40:04.634
Mikkei gets to screw
a major rival out of a big scor.

40:04.636 --> 40:07.404
And if ferrous ever caves
and offers them some kind

40:07.406 --> 40:11.007
Of revenue sharing deal,
the miners get 20 percent.

40:11.009 --> 40:13.977
I'm sorry i didn't get a chance
to tell you before

40:13.979 --> 40:15.712
But i couldn't chance
an intercept

40:15.714 --> 40:17.647
Of ship-to-surface
communication.

40:17.649 --> 40:19.649
Ah, we weren't worried.

40:19.651 --> 40:21.751
I had a feeling
you'd come back for us.

40:21.753 --> 40:22.852
Mhmm.

40:22.854 --> 40:25.655
Okay. So what's next?

40:25.657 --> 40:27.957
Well, nearest space station
is a couple of days out.

40:27.959 --> 40:31.594
We head there, refuel,
resupply, and then decide.

40:31.596 --> 40:34.197
In the meanwhile, we can
spend some quality time

40:34.199 --> 40:36.466
Getting to know each other.

40:40.705 --> 40:42.639
Sweet.

41:09.901 --> 41:11.968
[footsteps]

41:17.809 --> 41:19.742
[two knocking]

41:19.744 --> 41:20.910
[two]
am i interrupting?

41:20.912 --> 41:21.778
[five]
no.

41:21.780 --> 41:23.880
I'm just drawing.

41:23.882 --> 41:25.882
Can i ask you a question?

41:25.884 --> 41:27.484
Sure.

41:28.854 --> 41:32.689
Earlier today, you said someone

41:32.691 --> 41:35.225
Was responsible
for wiping our memories.

41:35.227 --> 41:37.026
Un huh.

41:37.028 --> 41:38.528
Why do you think that?

41:38.530 --> 41:41.498
I don't think... I know.

41:41.500 --> 41:43.766
And how do you know?

41:43.768 --> 41:46.035
I remember.

41:46.037 --> 41:50.974
Remember what, exactly?

41:50.976 --> 41:53.042
[five] waking up
in the middle of the night

41:53.044 --> 41:56.880
And uploading the program
into the stasis core.

41:58.617 --> 42:02.619
Planting the virus while
everyone else was sleeping.

42:06.658 --> 42:08.892
[two]
you remember doing this?

42:09.794 --> 42:11.594
[five] no, not me.

42:11.596 --> 42:13.229
It was someone else.

42:16.601 --> 42:18.001
[two]
who?

42:18.970 --> 42:23.973
[three] grunting and banging]

42:23.975 --> 42:27.844
[five] it's like i'm remembering
it for them.

42:28.580 --> 42:32.815
[two] and do you remember why
this person wiped our memories?

42:32.817 --> 42:36.219
Yeah.

42:36.221 --> 42:37.987
Because we're dangerous.
