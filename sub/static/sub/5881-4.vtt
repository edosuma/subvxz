00:39.998 --> 00:43.835
H-How fast were you going
when Mr. Adams jumped from the car?

00:46.588 --> 00:48.756
75?

00:50.968 --> 00:52.927
And-- And where was that?

00:53.011 --> 00:54.679
I-In your driveway?

00:57.015 --> 01:00.643
H-How far had Mr. Adams
gotten in the lesson?

01:00.728 --> 01:02.562
B-Backing out?

01:05.023 --> 01:07.275
It's not Lenny Bruce, but it's good .

01:07.359 --> 01:08.901
This is better. It's funny.

01:08.986 --> 01:11.446
This guy used to be an accountant,
Did you know that?

01:11.530 --> 01:12.822
Really?

01:12.906 --> 01:14.198
He's not anymore, is he?

01:16.034 --> 01:18.745
Your wife is here, Mr. Campbell .

01:18.829 --> 01:19.954
Thank you , H ildy.

01:20.038 --> 01:22.206
Lunch date. Good idea.

01:22.291 --> 01:24.208
You married folks.

01:24.293 --> 01:26.419
M ust be nice to spend
some time together.

01:28.922 --> 01:30.339
Hello, lovely.

01:30.424 --> 01:32.675
You can do better than that.

01:32.760 --> 01:34.427
Trudy, you know the fellas:

01:34.511 --> 01:36.429
Ken , Paul , and Harry, of course.

01:36.513 --> 01:38.473
You'll notice only men coming out of there.

01:38.557 --> 01:40.308
I know you all work so hard .

01:40.392 --> 01:41.392
How's Jennifer?

01:41.477 --> 01:42.977
Good . Swell, actually,

01:43.061 --> 01:44.979
considering she's still
at the phone company.

01:45.063 --> 01:46.147
Nothing I can do.

01:46.231 --> 01:48.983
That's not true.
You could give her a baby.

01:49.067 --> 01:50.985
You'll all in on it together.

01:51.069 --> 01:53.613
N ice to see you all again .

01:55.032 --> 01:56.240
Do we have a lunch date?

01:56.325 --> 01:58.743
Because Hildy,
she can show you the book.

01:58.827 --> 02:00.870
No, but I'm taking you away.

02:00.954 --> 02:03.873
Trudy, I don't think
taking you to lunch is part of my job.

02:03.957 --> 02:05.041
Do you have something today?

02:05.125 --> 02:07.460
No.

02:07.544 --> 02:09.378
I thought you'd be happy to see me.

02:09.463 --> 02:11.589
I called H ildy
and asked if you were free.

02:11.673 --> 02:14.008
It'll only take a minute, I promise.

02:14.092 --> 02:17.220
I'm sorry. It's great.
Where are we going?

02:17.304 --> 02:19.847
It's a surprise.

02:19.932 --> 02:23.351
Ah, Don, I'd like you
to meet my wife, Trudy Campbell.

02:23.435 --> 02:25.019
Don Draper. Nice to meet you .

02:25.103 --> 02:27.021
Congratulations.
You're a very lucky girl .

02:27.105 --> 02:30.024
I know. Most of my friends
can't find a good man .

02:30.108 --> 02:32.151
Believe me. I'm the lucky one.

02:32.236 --> 02:34.445
Yes, you are.

02:38.242 --> 02:39.867
He's essential to the process
around here.

02:39.952 --> 02:42.453
I think we're almost
as happy to have him as you are.

02:42.538 --> 02:45.039
Oh , I don't think that's possible.

02:45.123 --> 02:47.041
Well, maybe you're right.

02:47.125 --> 02:48.376
Nice to meet you .

02:51.171 --> 02:52.797
He's so nice.

02:52.881 --> 02:55.132
Not at all like what I imagined .

03:06.144 --> 03:09.230
1 ,500 square feet.
Two nice bedrooms.

03:09.314 --> 03:12.066
I don't know if that
includes that maid's room .

03:12.150 --> 03:14.151
Have to be a pretty small maid .

03:14.236 --> 03:15.736
It's on the market for 32,

03:15.821 --> 03:19.282
but Elaine, the realtor,
says we can get it for 30.

03:19.366 --> 03:24.954
Lovely, you know that I want
to give you everything .

03:25.038 --> 03:27.498
We don't have to pay
for the whole thing at once.

03:27.583 --> 03:28.749
We can get a mortgage.

03:28.834 --> 03:31.544
Trudy, I make $75 a week.

03:31.628 --> 03:33.462
Now, I know you're not good at math ,

03:33.547 --> 03:36.048
but that's $3,500 a year.

03:36.133 --> 03:38.092
You'll make more.

03:38.176 --> 03:39.594
Eventually.

03:39.678 --> 03:41.470
But if we put 1 0% down ,

03:41.555 --> 03:43.139
that's an entire year's salary.

03:43.223 --> 03:46.100
Sweetheart, we're not in this alone.

03:46.184 --> 03:50.187
We're a young couple
that needs a little help.

03:55.319 --> 03:58.112
Did you see the sink
in the master bathroom?

03:58.196 --> 04:00.239
It's the same one
they have in The Pierre.

04:08.749 --> 04:10.583
Bill it all to Menken's, Fred .

04:10.667 --> 04:12.919
The girl knows where I
keep the accounts.

04:18.133 --> 04:19.133
Hello.

04:19.217 --> 04:20.468
Mr. Draper.

04:20.552 --> 04:23.054
Didn't expect to see you back here.

04:23.138 --> 04:26.140
Well, we're, uh, screening
a television commercial .

04:26.224 --> 04:29.226
It'll probably look better
when it's breaking up Bonanza.

04:30.479 --> 04:32.063
His work is wonderful.

04:32.147 --> 04:33.981
He's perfect for Menken's.

04:34.066 --> 04:35.691
So he keeps telling me.

04:37.611 --> 04:40.404
Well , I'll let you see Miss Menken out.

04:47.037 --> 04:49.163
How are you?

04:49.247 --> 04:50.748
I'm fine.

04:50.832 --> 04:52.375
My family is fine.

04:52.459 --> 04:54.418
The weather has been spectacular.

04:54.503 --> 04:56.170
Rachel , listen--

04:56.254 --> 04:57.546
What are you doing?

04:58.924 --> 05:00.424
I don't know.

05:02.260 --> 05:04.178
I don't want it to be like this.

05:04.262 --> 05:06.889
Yes, well. . .

05:06.974 --> 05:09.433
we both know how we'd like it to be.

05:09.518 --> 05:12.186
Can we at least
have lunch sometime?

05:12.270 --> 05:15.398
I really can't see a reason for that.

05:21.697 --> 05:23.197
"Church bells rang out,

05:23.281 --> 05:26.200
"and the air was filled
with flying birds.

05:26.284 --> 05:29.120
"What a joyous parade it was
back at the palace.

05:29.204 --> 05:33.207
No king could command
anything finer."

05:33.291 --> 05:36.752
The end .

05:39.798 --> 05:40.923
Again?

05:41.008 --> 05:43.009
Daddy will see you in the morning .

05:54.438 --> 05:57.314
Helen , come on . I know you're in there.

05:59.317 --> 06:02.319
Damn it! Helen! Open the door!

06:07.242 --> 06:09.535
Excuse me, Miss.

06:09.619 --> 06:12.329
I know you can hear me. Miss?

06:14.416 --> 06:17.126
Look, can I use your phone?

06:17.210 --> 06:19.462
I'm her husband .

06:19.546 --> 06:22.506
I'm supposed to see my kids,
and I know she's in there.

06:22.591 --> 06:24.258
I just called from the gas station .

06:24.342 --> 06:27.136
No. I'm sorry.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.430
Are you serious?

06:29.514 --> 06:31.682
I'm sure you are who you say you are,

06:31.767 --> 06:34.351
but I don't let strange men
into my home.

06:35.353 --> 06:36.353
Come on .

06:57.042 --> 06:58.292
Can I come in?

06:58.376 --> 07:00.002
Of course.

07:07.385 --> 07:09.303
I'm really sorry.

07:09.387 --> 07:11.555
I'm so embarrassed .

07:14.017 --> 07:16.310
I don't know
what you're talking about.

07:16.394 --> 07:20.397
Yes, you do. I was at the window.

07:22.400 --> 07:24.401
Did you let him in?

07:26.404 --> 07:27.404
Yes.

07:30.033 --> 07:32.743
He's not a bad man .

07:36.414 --> 07:38.415
Do you want some coffee?

07:42.796 --> 07:44.338
It's a joke, really.

07:44.422 --> 07:47.133
Dan hardly saw the kids
at all when we were married .

07:47.217 --> 07:49.552
He works in Manhattan . Life insurance.

07:49.636 --> 07:52.888
Now, all of a sudden ,
he can't live without them .

07:52.973 --> 07:55.432
Of course, if he does die, I'm set.

07:58.228 --> 07:59.353
I'm joking .

08:03.108 --> 08:04.525
What happened?

08:06.403 --> 08:08.237
I'll tell you exactly.

08:08.321 --> 08:10.656
He had a lot of friends in the city.

08:10.740 --> 08:15.369
There was poker and tennis,
drinks at the River Club.

08:15.453 --> 08:17.454
Turned out none of them were men .

08:19.082 --> 08:20.666
Oh, I'm-- I'm sorry.

08:20.750 --> 08:23.794
I really just meant
tonight what happened .

08:23.879 --> 08:26.005
Please, I figure I might as well say it.

08:26.089 --> 08:28.132
That's what you've all been
guessing anyway, right?

08:28.216 --> 08:30.050
We haven't all been doing anything.

08:32.470 --> 08:34.805
Okay.

08:34.890 --> 08:36.265
The strangest part of it

08:36.349 --> 08:39.393
is that I think he's angrier
at me than I am at him .

08:39.477 --> 08:40.936
Of course my father got a lawyer,

08:41.021 --> 08:43.480
an army buddy who just
hammered the hell out of him .

08:45.275 --> 08:47.276
I've always loved that house.

08:54.242 --> 08:56.118
Hello.

09:02.500 --> 09:06.253
He has to go right upstairs
and have complete quiet for a while.

09:06.338 --> 09:08.464
He works so hard .

09:08.548 --> 09:10.257
I should get back.

09:10.342 --> 09:12.134
My kids are asleep.

09:32.948 --> 09:34.782
Boat's in the water.

09:38.536 --> 09:40.454
Your cousin Sara had her baby.

09:40.538 --> 09:42.039
Named it after your Uncle Skip.

09:42.123 --> 09:43.332
I think that's nice.

09:46.002 --> 09:49.797
Everything's all ready in the trunks.

09:49.881 --> 09:51.674
We do hope you and Trudy

09:51.758 --> 09:54.301
will be making it out
to the house this summer.

09:54.386 --> 09:56.887
We'll try, but I'm not sure

09:56.972 --> 09:59.390
I'll be able to take
the time off from work.

09:59.474 --> 10:03.143
Work? Ha, I still don't
understand what you do.

10:03.228 --> 10:05.062
I'd hate for you
to miss the blackberries.

10:05.146 --> 10:07.147
Run into you at the club, you're working .

10:07.232 --> 10:09.024
At a restaurant, you're working .

10:09.109 --> 10:10.859
Taking people out to dinner,

10:10.944 --> 10:13.362
wining and whoring.

10:13.446 --> 10:14.947
No job for a white man .

10:15.031 --> 10:19.493
She's made such a nice
addition to the table.

10:19.577 --> 10:21.412
So nice and appreciative.

10:21.496 --> 10:23.831
There's a lot more to it than that.

10:25.083 --> 10:26.959
Advertising . Really?

10:27.043 --> 10:30.379
See, if someone were to tell me
there's a lot more to the law,

10:30.463 --> 10:31.588
I'd believe him .

10:34.301 --> 10:37.052
I can't explain
how business works to you .

10:38.596 --> 10:41.515
Trudy found an apartment
that she likes.

10:41.599 --> 10:43.851
Did she? Whereabouts?

10:43.935 --> 10:46.020
83rd and Park. Very nice.

10:46.104 --> 10:48.439
Are you sure you want
to be that far uptown?

10:48.523 --> 10:49.523
It's not that far, Dad .

10:49.607 --> 10:51.525
It falls off after 79th .

10:51.609 --> 10:54.862
No, darling . They fall off after 86th .

10:54.946 --> 10:56.947
It's a very nice area.

10:57.032 --> 10:58.157
It is.

10:59.367 --> 11:02.036
And , well. . .

11:02.120 --> 11:04.955
it's actually kind of expensive,

11:05.040 --> 11:10.544
so we're going to need help
with the down payment.

11:10.628 --> 11:12.129
Really?

11:12.213 --> 11:14.381
Yes.

11:17.302 --> 11:19.928
No, I don't think that's a good idea.

11:20.013 --> 11:23.140
And why is that?

11:23.224 --> 11:26.643
I just don't think it's a good idea.

11:28.146 --> 11:30.564
You thought it was
a good idea to help Bud

11:30.648 --> 11:33.400
when he hit that girl on her bike
in Montauk last summer.

11:33.485 --> 11:34.651
What did that cost?

11:43.661 --> 11:45.621
I presume it's your profession

11:45.705 --> 11:49.166
that is responsible
for this lapse in your manners.

11:49.250 --> 11:51.585
I'll pay you back.

11:51.669 --> 11:55.130
It's not about the money, Peter.

11:55.215 --> 11:56.673
You know that.

12:00.762 --> 12:03.597
Why is it so hard
for you people to give me anything?

12:03.681 --> 12:05.307
We gave you everything .

12:05.392 --> 12:07.893
We gave you your name.

12:07.977 --> 12:10.604
And what have you done with it?

12:25.578 --> 12:27.621
Did you have a nice visit?

12:27.705 --> 12:31.291
They're very keen on us coming out
to Fisher's Island this summer.

12:31.376 --> 12:33.377
Can they help with the apartment?

12:34.712 --> 12:36.213
I didn't bring it up.

12:36.297 --> 12:39.299
My dad's been having
some health problems.

12:39.384 --> 12:42.177
Oh , sweetheart.

12:42.262 --> 12:43.929
What's wrong with him?

12:46.766 --> 12:48.642
Nobody knows.

12:56.776 --> 12:58.402
Walter, how's it going?

12:58.486 --> 12:59.945
Never have much luck,

13:00.029 --> 13:02.614
unless I'm playing
against Campbell here.

13:02.699 --> 13:05.075
Well, he's known for losing gracefully.

13:05.160 --> 13:08.328
You know our art director,
Salvatore Romano.

13:08.413 --> 13:11.081
Did you have a good time
in the city last night?

13:11.166 --> 13:12.332
When I come into town ,

13:12.417 --> 13:14.293
I like to do my business and go home.

13:14.377 --> 13:15.669
Unwind with the Psalms.

13:15.753 --> 13:18.338
No man should have to live
out of a suitcase.

13:18.423 --> 13:22.092
So what do you fellows have for me?

13:22.177 --> 13:27.181
Well, we take for granted
the things we need the most:

13:27.265 --> 13:31.435
water, oil, electricity. . .steel.

13:31.519 --> 13:33.854
I was thinking
about the last time you were here,

13:33.938 --> 13:37.608
looking out this window
at this incredible city

13:37.692 --> 13:41.737
and saying . . . "It's all steel."

13:43.156 --> 13:44.698
New York City:

13:44.782 --> 13:48.702
brought to you by Bethlehem Steel.

13:48.786 --> 13:50.120
The city of Pittsburgh,

13:50.205 --> 13:52.372
brought to you by Bethlehem Steel.

13:52.457 --> 13:56.084
The city of Chicago,
Detroit, St. Louis.

13:56.169 --> 13:58.712
Full-page ads in targeted markets:

13:58.796 --> 14:00.797
newspapers, trade publications.

14:00.882 --> 14:02.508
Throw in a few billboards

14:02.592 --> 14:05.093
so your employees can
brag to their girlfriends.

14:09.349 --> 14:11.558
They're kind of plain , aren't they?

14:11.643 --> 14:15.562
Reminds me of those WPA ads
before the war.

14:16.773 --> 14:18.273
Walter, you've been
doing this long enough .

14:18.358 --> 14:20.484
We can throw this artwork
away in a minute.

14:22.278 --> 14:25.405
But the sentiment, the idea,
it's so basic,

14:25.490 --> 14:27.032
you feel like you already know it.

14:27.116 --> 14:29.117
You just haven't thought of it lately.

14:30.828 --> 14:33.413
Cities are made of steel .

14:33.498 --> 14:35.165
Bethlehem Steel.

14:35.250 --> 14:39.336
I might be wrong,
but these feel like ads for cities.

14:39.420 --> 14:41.547
You're making our company

14:41.631 --> 14:44.466
look like a middleman
for another product.

14:44.551 --> 14:47.803
Well, would you prefer
an I-beam on a plate

14:47.887 --> 14:49.972
with a pat of butter on it?

14:50.056 --> 14:52.057
No need to get cute, Don .

14:52.141 --> 14:53.767
Just making a point.

14:53.851 --> 14:56.770
Steel is not something
that you can buy at the supermarket.

14:56.854 --> 15:00.023
But it is a commodity.

15:00.108 --> 15:01.275
Walter, I'm surprised .

15:01.359 --> 15:04.444
I believe this is fairly close
to what we had talked about.

15:04.529 --> 15:05.946
We talked about a national strategy

15:06.030 --> 15:09.491
that would involve the virtues
of this essential commodity.

15:09.576 --> 15:10.826
I believe it was more specific.

15:10.910 --> 15:13.579
Don, Walter
has expressed himself.

15:13.663 --> 15:15.998
Now, Walter, if this does not meet
your expectations,

15:16.082 --> 15:18.166
I'm sure Don can find
something that does,

15:18.251 --> 15:19.251
right, Don?

15:19.335 --> 15:21.003
I hate to be a pain in the ass,

15:21.087 --> 15:23.797
but if they didn't
just lay there so flat.

15:23.881 --> 15:27.843
I don't know, Maybe it's because
I'm not from a city.

15:27.927 --> 15:31.471
They just. . .bother me.

15:31.556 --> 15:33.682
Look, if we can persuade you

15:33.766 --> 15:35.267
to stay in town
another 24 hours--

15:35.351 --> 15:37.019
back at the St. Regis, of course--

15:37.103 --> 15:38.562
it would give us a chance

15:38.646 --> 15:40.063
to come up with something
with more impact.

15:40.148 --> 15:42.816
Get you tickets to a Broadway show.

15:42.900 --> 15:44.818
There's a new one: uh, Bye Bye Birdie.

15:44.902 --> 15:46.695
I don't like birds, either.

15:46.779 --> 15:48.697
Well , something else, then .

15:48.781 --> 15:52.075
Pete, I think Sal can
show Mr. Veith out. Walt.

15:54.912 --> 15:57.831
Sorry about that.
They are good drawings.

15:57.915 --> 16:01.126
No, the WPA was a very respected style.

16:01.210 --> 16:02.919
20 years ago.

16:08.760 --> 16:10.510
What the hell was that?

16:10.595 --> 16:12.095
Come on , Don .

16:12.180 --> 16:15.432
That's not the first time
someone's been unhappy.

16:15.516 --> 16:16.850
Give it a haircut.

16:16.934 --> 16:18.977
He's a second-time guy anyway.
I could feel that.

16:19.062 --> 16:21.521
And I could feel
he was sentences away.

16:21.606 --> 16:23.148
I'm that kind of guy.

16:23.232 --> 16:24.858
He didn't like the idea.

16:24.942 --> 16:27.027
Someone hadn't prepared him
to like the idea,

16:27.111 --> 16:30.906
an idea he was extremely enthusiastic
about three months ago.

16:30.990 --> 16:34.868
I'm sorry I didn't lower
his expectations enough .

16:34.952 --> 16:36.870
You do your job.

16:36.954 --> 16:38.997
Take him sailing .
Get him in a bathing suit.

16:39.082 --> 16:40.624
Leave the ideas to me.

16:40.708 --> 16:42.876
I have ideas.

16:42.960 --> 16:44.878
I'm sure you do.

16:44.962 --> 16:48.382
Sterling Cooper has more failed artists
and intellectuals than the Third Reich .

16:48.466 --> 16:51.677
You know what? I have good ideas.

16:51.761 --> 16:54.888
In fact, I used to carry around
a notebook and pen just to keep track.

16:54.972 --> 16:57.224
Direct marketing. I thought of that.

16:57.308 --> 17:00.894
Turned out it already existed,
but I arrived at it independently.

17:00.978 --> 17:02.562
And then I come to this place,

17:02.647 --> 17:04.773
and you people tell me
I'm good with people,

17:04.857 --> 17:05.899
which is strange

17:05.983 --> 17:08.402
because I'd never heard that before.

17:19.789 --> 17:21.123
Draper residence.

17:21.207 --> 17:24.751
Betty? Helen Bishop. Are you busy?

17:24.836 --> 17:28.755
Well . . .no, I'm just finishing up dinner.

17:30.007 --> 17:31.216
Of course.

17:31.300 --> 17:35.929
Listen, this may be truly rude,
but I was wondering .

17:36.013 --> 17:39.307
I'm supposed to be stuffing envelopes
at Kennedy Headquarters tonight,

17:39.392 --> 17:41.935
and my sitter just cancelled ,

17:42.019 --> 17:44.521
and I hate to back out
because, well, you know,

17:44.605 --> 17:46.940
New York State is so important.

17:47.024 --> 17:49.234
I didn't know that.

17:49.318 --> 17:50.485
Well , anyway, I was wondering

17:50.570 --> 17:52.946
if you could come watch
the kids for a few hours.

17:53.030 --> 17:54.656
Right now?

17:57.577 --> 18:00.162
You know what?
I shouldn't have asked .

18:02.832 --> 18:06.251
Well , let me just get dinner on the table.

18:06.335 --> 18:09.421
I guess Don can watch the kids.

18:09.505 --> 18:12.340
Really? Gosh, that would be wonderful .

18:12.425 --> 18:14.468
Take your time.

18:14.552 --> 18:18.305
Put that lemonade into the floor show.

18:18.389 --> 18:20.223
That's a swell idea!

18:20.308 --> 18:22.100
But how could we do that?

18:25.229 --> 18:26.980
Oh , you're a lifesaver, truly.

18:27.064 --> 18:29.858
I can't tell you how much I appreciate this.

18:29.942 --> 18:31.026
Hiroshima, I know.

18:31.110 --> 18:33.445
Cleaning lady and babysitter are one.

18:33.529 --> 18:34.988
Oh , stop.

18:35.072 --> 18:36.907
It's charming .

18:39.410 --> 18:40.994
That's beautiful, Glen .

18:41.078 --> 18:42.537
Except he can wake the baby.

18:42.622 --> 18:43.663
Glen , stop that now.

18:43.748 --> 18:44.998
You remember Mrs. Draper?

18:45.082 --> 18:47.459
She's going to take
care of you while I'm gone.

18:47.543 --> 18:49.002
No ironing .

18:49.086 --> 18:51.004
Ironing?

18:51.088 --> 18:53.632
I give him 5 cents a piece.
He loves doing it,

18:53.716 --> 18:55.008
Oh, there you are.

18:55.092 --> 18:58.678
I swear to God , I am so exhausted
when I get home from the jewelry store

18:58.763 --> 19:01.765
that I just kick these off,
and I never know where they end up.

19:01.849 --> 19:04.017
You, Glen Bishop, in bed
after The Real McCoys.

19:04.101 --> 19:05.519
No discussions.

19:10.024 --> 19:11.399
You look very nice.

19:12.527 --> 19:14.236
They keep the place poorly lit.

19:16.113 --> 19:19.491
I guess there'll be a lot of nice men there.

19:19.575 --> 19:23.078
Yes. I guess so,
although it's mostly women .

19:23.162 --> 19:25.038
Have you seen the candidate?

19:25.122 --> 19:27.833
On the news. He's handsome.

19:27.917 --> 19:30.043
But I'm not sure who we're voting for.

19:30.127 --> 19:32.754
Well, I'll bring you back
some literature.

19:32.839 --> 19:34.339
I'll be back before 1 0, I promise.

19:34.423 --> 19:35.423
Glen .

19:55.152 --> 19:57.070
You got to get
that Lux soap campaign

19:57.154 --> 19:58.613
over to Sterling Cooper.

19:58.698 --> 20:00.866
Janet Leigh and Natalie Wood--

20:00.950 --> 20:02.450
now, there's a day at the office.

20:02.535 --> 20:04.077
Is that an orange?

20:04.161 --> 20:07.622
I'm telling you, you boys,
you've got it made.

20:07.707 --> 20:08.915
Martini lunches,

20:09.000 --> 20:11.084
gorgeous women parading through .

20:11.168 --> 20:13.753
In my next life,
I'm coming back as an ad man .

20:13.838 --> 20:16.089
Well, there's slightly more to it than that.

20:16.173 --> 20:17.966
Yeah? Well, I'd keep that to yourself.

20:18.050 --> 20:19.217
I met his boss yesterday.

20:19.302 --> 20:21.094
You should have heard
the nice things he said .

20:21.178 --> 20:22.846
He's not my boss.

20:22.930 --> 20:24.723
Well, isn't that nice?

20:24.807 --> 20:26.892
To be appreciated for what you do?

20:28.185 --> 20:30.770
We have some great news.

20:30.855 --> 20:32.564
Already?

20:32.648 --> 20:35.734
Honestly, you two. It's not that.

20:35.818 --> 20:37.611
We found an apartment.

20:37.695 --> 20:40.822
Oh . Well, that's exciting , too.

20:40.907 --> 20:42.073
Yes, well, unfortunately,

20:42.158 --> 20:44.242
it's a bit out of our
price range right now.

20:44.327 --> 20:45.744
I've been looking in the neighborhood ,

20:45.828 --> 20:47.454
and it seems very well priced to me:

20:47.538 --> 20:49.998
32, but the realtor says
we can get it for 30.

20:50.082 --> 20:51.374
- Around here?
- 83rd , but--

20:51.459 --> 20:53.627
- How many rooms?
- Five:

20:53.711 --> 20:55.128
two bedrooms, two baths, a terrace.

20:56.881 --> 20:58.131
I don't know.

20:58.215 --> 21:00.634
I'd have to look at it first.

21:06.682 --> 21:07.682
Oh, thank you .

21:07.767 --> 21:09.559
Sir--

21:09.644 --> 21:11.770
I'll take Tom or Dad , you got me?

21:13.356 --> 21:17.442
Tom , it's very generous
for you to even consider it,

21:17.526 --> 21:20.362
but I think we'd rather wait.

21:22.156 --> 21:23.156
For what?

21:23.240 --> 21:24.574
Start your life already.

21:24.659 --> 21:26.159
You're gonna be a rich bastard
on your own someday,

21:26.243 --> 21:27.869
and waiting's a bunch of bullshit.

21:27.954 --> 21:29.454
- Tomcat,
- It is.

21:29.538 --> 21:30.956
Your confidence is really--

21:31.040 --> 21:32.874
well , it's swell.

21:32.959 --> 21:35.919
But honestly,
I'm not sure it's a good idea.

21:36.003 --> 21:37.170
I am .

21:37.254 --> 21:41.299
Pete, this is an investment
for me, in you .

21:42.510 --> 21:44.928
And my jellybean over here, of course.

21:53.270 --> 21:55.939
Oh , thank you . You're gonna love it.

21:56.023 --> 21:57.691
We'll be so happy there.

22:12.039 --> 22:13.581
I knew they'd help us.

22:13.666 --> 22:15.500
I know you did .

22:15.584 --> 22:17.544
Oh , come on .

22:17.628 --> 22:20.171
You can't possibly be angry with me.

22:22.216 --> 22:25.427
I'm just not sure taking that kind
of money is a good idea.

22:25.511 --> 22:27.220
He's not paying for the whole thing.

22:27.304 --> 22:28.805
It's still a lot of money,

22:28.889 --> 22:30.432
and I'm not sure what it means.

22:30.516 --> 22:34.644
It means
we get the apartment.

22:34.729 --> 22:37.689
Do they get to tell us
where to put the furniture?

22:37.773 --> 22:40.233
They're not like that.

22:40.317 --> 22:42.235
You would have taken
money from your parents.

22:42.319 --> 22:43.319
That's different.

22:43.404 --> 22:44.404
Why?

22:44.488 --> 22:46.364
Because that's my money.

22:46.449 --> 22:47.615
I'll get it eventually.

22:47.700 --> 22:49.909
So this is my money.

22:49.994 --> 22:53.246
Sweetheart, he wants to help.

22:53.330 --> 22:54.748
It makes him feel good .

22:54.832 --> 22:57.751
Well , what about me?

23:00.004 --> 23:02.714
You always get
what you want, don't you?

23:02.798 --> 23:07.343
I got you . That's all I really wanted .

23:10.222 --> 23:13.099
Excuse me.
Can we turn up Park?

23:13.184 --> 23:15.060
I need to meet a client downtown .

23:15.144 --> 23:18.146
H ush . It'll only take a sec.

23:18.230 --> 23:20.231
The Armory.

23:20.316 --> 23:23.359
When are they gonna
tear that dinosaur down?

23:45.382 --> 23:47.175
I'll be right back.

24:49.405 --> 24:50.655
I'm in here.

24:52.449 --> 24:54.576
Glen , I said get out.

24:57.663 --> 24:59.706
Young man , what is wrong with you?

24:59.790 --> 25:00.874
This room is occupied .

25:14.513 --> 25:17.307
What do you have to say for yourself?

25:19.310 --> 25:21.561
Glen, look at me.

25:21.645 --> 25:23.813
That was very bad .

25:26.817 --> 25:29.944
You know better than to walk in
on someone like that.

25:30.029 --> 25:34.282
That room is private, extremely private.

25:35.951 --> 25:39.245
Well , that's all I'm trying to say.

25:40.497 --> 25:42.123
Now look at me.

25:44.501 --> 25:47.045
Don't you think
you owe me an apology?

25:49.590 --> 25:50.798
Well?

25:50.883 --> 25:52.967
I'm sorry.

25:54.511 --> 25:55.929
Well, good .

25:56.013 --> 25:59.349
That's not the way to behave, okay?

26:05.522 --> 26:07.440
Now. . .

26:07.524 --> 26:11.527
It's all right. I'm not angry anymore.

26:22.039 --> 26:24.666
You're pretty.

26:27.544 --> 26:28.711
Well, thank you , dear.

26:28.796 --> 26:31.464
Really pretty.

26:31.548 --> 26:35.468
That's sweet of you to say.

26:35.552 --> 26:38.263
How old are you?

26:38.347 --> 26:43.142
Well , I'm the same age
as your mother.

26:43.227 --> 26:44.644
How old is your mother?

26:44.728 --> 26:46.104
She's 32.

26:46.188 --> 26:48.189
I'm 28.

26:50.651 --> 26:54.988
Your hair is so beautiful ,
You look like a princess.

26:55.072 --> 26:57.615
Well, I don't know about that.

26:57.700 --> 26:59.117
Can I have some?

26:59.201 --> 27:00.493
What?

27:00.577 --> 27:04.122
Can I have some of your hair?

27:06.333 --> 27:08.293
Glen, no.

27:08.377 --> 27:09.460
Just a little piece?

27:09.545 --> 27:10.670
Glen .

27:10.754 --> 27:12.588
You won't even miss it.

27:36.613 --> 27:38.614
Now off to bed with you .

27:40.326 --> 27:41.701
And no radio.

28:04.600 --> 28:06.100
Evening, gentlemen .

28:07.186 --> 28:08.853
Walter, I'd like you to meet my cousins

28:08.937 --> 28:09.937
Charlotte and Wendy.

28:10.022 --> 28:12.857
Ladies, it's a pleasure.

28:12.941 --> 28:15.568
We were hoping
you were Pete's friends.

28:15.652 --> 28:17.362
You must be the man of steel.

28:17.446 --> 28:18.988
Will you look at that?

28:19.073 --> 28:22.325
You could lose a nickel
in those dimples.

28:24.828 --> 28:27.080
I thought your cousin
Wendy was a redhead .

28:27.164 --> 28:29.332
No, that's my cousin Doris.

28:29.416 --> 28:31.417
She wasn't available this evening .

28:31.502 --> 28:34.670
Well, I think we can make do
with this branch of the family.

28:36.673 --> 28:38.633
I'm glad you decided to stay over.

28:38.717 --> 28:40.093
So am I .

28:40.177 --> 28:44.680
Hey, bottle of champagne for the table
and another round of these, plus one.

28:51.855 --> 28:55.441
You know, I had some thoughts
about your campaign today.

28:55.526 --> 28:56.776
Did you?

28:56.860 --> 29:01.864
Well, I was trying to express
the essentialness of steel,

29:01.949 --> 29:05.827
and I thought, Bethlehem Steel :

29:05.911 --> 29:08.413
the backbone of America.

29:08.497 --> 29:10.039
What do you think?

29:10.124 --> 29:14.460
Unbelievable. Did Draper tell you
to try and sneak this one by me?

29:14.545 --> 29:15.628
No. I was just--

29:15.712 --> 29:17.422
Campbell , get off the clock.

29:17.506 --> 29:20.967
We have two lovely ladies here.

29:21.051 --> 29:25.888
The only backbone
I'm interested in now is right here.

29:27.307 --> 29:30.643
So, tell me, Wendy, what do you do

29:30.727 --> 29:34.605
when you're not
lighting up rooms with your smile?

29:34.690 --> 29:37.650
Well, I'm an actress,
and I take some classes at H unter.

29:37.734 --> 29:39.152
Do you?

29:39.236 --> 29:43.239
I would have thought you slept all day
and bathed in milk.

29:57.588 --> 29:59.589
How was it?

29:59.673 --> 30:02.925
It was nice. Very quiet.

30:03.010 --> 30:05.511
Oh . In case you're interested .

30:05.596 --> 30:08.514
Oh . Thank you .

30:08.599 --> 30:10.725
I'll be sure to look at it.

30:10.809 --> 30:11.934
I can't thank you enough .

30:12.019 --> 30:14.061
I hope I can return the favor sometime.

30:14.146 --> 30:17.440
Oh , please, don't even think about it.

30:59.483 --> 31:02.360
Looks pretty familiar.

31:02.444 --> 31:06.030
Well, I wanted to maintain
our original strategy,

31:06.114 --> 31:08.741
but I think the wordplay achieves
what you're looking for:

31:08.825 --> 31:10.576
the idea that from the acorn--

31:10.661 --> 31:12.453
that is, Bethlehem Steel--

31:12.538 --> 31:14.539
comes America's great cities.

31:14.623 --> 31:17.166
I know this isn't the idea
you want to sell me,

31:17.251 --> 31:18.834
so don't sell it so damn well.

31:20.837 --> 31:22.129
Excuse me?

31:22.214 --> 31:24.298
The backbone idea.

31:24.383 --> 31:26.759
Campbell pitched it to me last night.

31:26.843 --> 31:28.010
I like it.

31:28.095 --> 31:30.930
What backbone idea?

31:31.014 --> 31:33.891
Bethlehem Steel:
the backbone of America.

31:33.976 --> 31:39.647
Wasn't that it?

31:39.731 --> 31:40.731
Oh, right.

31:40.816 --> 31:42.233
It's concise, strong ,

31:42.317 --> 31:45.778
and frankly, I like that you were
so enthusiastic about it

31:45.862 --> 31:47.863
you couldn't wait to tell me.

31:52.911 --> 31:54.328
Thanks again , boys.

31:54.413 --> 31:55.788
Pleasure to make you happy, Walt.

31:55.872 --> 31:57.832
Hope your visit to New York was productive.

31:57.916 --> 31:59.917
I'm warming to the place.

32:06.883 --> 32:08.634
N ice work.

32:08.719 --> 32:10.803
I told you I had ideas.

32:10.887 --> 32:12.805
Yes, you did .

32:12.889 --> 32:15.891
Good one. Enjoy it.

32:17.936 --> 32:19.729
You know what I think?

32:19.813 --> 32:23.566
I think I did something good,
and you got the compliment for it.

32:25.902 --> 32:27.737
Listen, Pete,

32:27.821 --> 32:32.825
I need you to go
get a cardboard box. . .

32:32.909 --> 32:35.077
and put your things in it.

32:35.162 --> 32:36.495
Okay?

32:46.632 --> 32:48.924
You picked the wrong time
to buy an apartment.

33:01.938 --> 33:05.858
H-How far has Mr. Adams
gotten in the lesson?

33:05.942 --> 33:07.943
B-Backing out?

33:09.071 --> 33:10.529
Everybody out.

33:10.614 --> 33:12.615
Now!

33:14.493 --> 33:16.452
Uh , did he cover starting the car?

33:17.913 --> 33:19.955
And the other way to stop.

33:33.804 --> 33:35.262
Remember Pete Campbell's last day?

33:36.306 --> 33:37.473
It's today.

33:37.557 --> 33:38.849
What happened?

33:38.975 --> 33:42.228
While I was breaking my neck
trying to fix the hash he made yesterday,

33:42.312 --> 33:44.146
he was at the St. Regis pitching copy.

33:45.399 --> 33:46.774
His copy.

33:47.984 --> 33:50.069
That little shit.

34:20.225 --> 34:24.854
It was hard to see her all alone like that. . .

34:26.022 --> 34:31.110
supporting herself
with that sad little job at the jewelry store.

34:31.194 --> 34:33.320
Frozen food .

34:34.740 --> 34:36.949
I mean , I know
she gets some kind of help,

34:37.033 --> 34:41.829
but still, she looks so exhausted .

34:41.913 --> 34:44.415
She tries to put on a brave face.

34:59.765 --> 35:02.558
Honestly, I think she's jealous of me.

35:03.935 --> 35:06.604
I've seen it before. I was in a sorority.

35:09.191 --> 35:12.860
I mean , seeing happy families all around .

35:14.070 --> 35:15.905
But I don't know what I can do.

35:15.989 --> 35:18.574
I can't just disappear. I live there.

35:22.496 --> 35:25.915
Of course, my real concern
is those children .

35:27.083 --> 35:28.793
I mean, the baby
won't know the difference,

35:28.877 --> 35:30.878
but that poor little boy.

35:37.010 --> 35:41.013
The person taking care of him
isn't giving him what he needs.

35:43.099 --> 35:44.517
You know?

36:06.122 --> 36:08.040
Gentlemen , please.

36:12.504 --> 36:14.463
You really love that thing .

36:14.548 --> 36:17.424
You were cute back then .

36:22.639 --> 36:25.516
Pete Campbell .

36:25.600 --> 36:26.934
On his way out.

36:27.018 --> 36:28.769
Sorry to hear that.

36:28.854 --> 36:30.855
Can't be avoided , I'm afraid .

36:30.939 --> 36:32.606
I wish I could agree with that.

36:33.942 --> 36:35.734
He's a junior account executive

36:35.819 --> 36:40.364
who brought his own idea
to a client in a bar.

36:40.448 --> 36:41.657
There are rules.

36:41.741 --> 36:44.285
There are other rules.

36:46.162 --> 36:48.080
What's the problem?

36:49.708 --> 36:53.085
New York City is a marvelous machine

36:53.169 --> 36:57.673
filled with a mesh of levers
and gears and springs,

36:57.757 --> 37:01.844
like a fine watch wound tight.

37:01.928 --> 37:03.679
Always ticking .

37:03.763 --> 37:05.389
Sounds more like a bomb.

37:05.473 --> 37:08.183
How much do you know
about Pete's family?

37:08.268 --> 37:10.769
Nothing , except they put out
a mediocre product.

37:10.854 --> 37:14.106
His mother is
Dorothy Dykeman Campbell .

37:14.190 --> 37:16.275
The Dykemans
owned pretty much everything

37:16.359 --> 37:18.110
north of 1 25th Street,

37:18.194 --> 37:20.571
which I don't know
how good your geography is,

37:20.655 --> 37:23.073
but that's a fair chunk of the island .

37:23.158 --> 37:25.451
So they're rich . So what?

37:25.535 --> 37:26.869
Well, no.

37:26.953 --> 37:30.080
Uh, his grandfather dropped it all in '29.

37:30.165 --> 37:31.457
Panicked .

37:31.541 --> 37:35.294
Some people have no confidence
in this country.

37:37.213 --> 37:38.797
What's your concern , then?

37:38.882 --> 37:42.301
Well, I don't want
Dorothy Dykeman Campbell

37:42.385 --> 37:45.137
standing on the dock
at Fisher's Island this summer

37:45.221 --> 37:48.849
talking about how badly
Sterling Cooper treated her son .

37:48.934 --> 37:51.226
I don't think any of us want that.

37:51.311 --> 37:52.811
We lose him ,

37:52.896 --> 37:56.357
we lose our entree to Buckley, DKE,

37:56.441 --> 38:00.152
the Maidstone Club, the Century Club,

38:00.236 --> 38:01.987
Dartmouth . . .

38:02.072 --> 38:05.157
Gracie Mansion sometimes.

38:05.241 --> 38:07.910
It's a marquee issue for us.

38:07.994 --> 38:11.121
See my point?

38:11.206 --> 38:13.123
Absolutely.

38:13.208 --> 38:16.001
He's more valuable to the agency than I am .

38:16.086 --> 38:17.169
Don't fool yourself.

38:17.253 --> 38:20.172
There's a Pete Campbell
at every agency out there.

38:20.256 --> 38:22.216
Well , let's get one of the other ones.

38:22.300 --> 38:24.134
You're going to need a stronger stomach

38:24.219 --> 38:28.263
if you're going to be back in the kitchen
seeing how the sausage is made.

38:30.934 --> 38:32.267
Thought it was a big watch .

38:34.938 --> 38:37.022
You handle the words.

38:37.107 --> 38:41.986
You know how much
we want you here with us.

38:42.070 --> 38:44.196
No doubt about that.

38:44.280 --> 38:46.532
Don's a big boy, Bert.

38:46.616 --> 38:48.909
Aren't you , Don?

38:55.208 --> 38:57.501
Well , thank you , sir.

38:59.295 --> 39:01.422
There you go.

39:04.300 --> 39:07.302
I'm glad we're all better now.

39:30.744 --> 39:34.079
What you did
is totally unacceptable.

39:34.164 --> 39:35.247
I realize that.

39:35.331 --> 39:37.249
I want you to be very clear about this.

39:37.333 --> 39:39.084
You were fired . I wanted you out.

39:39.169 --> 39:40.419
Cooper wanted you out.

39:40.503 --> 39:43.338
And you would be if it weren't for this man .

39:44.799 --> 39:47.134
He thought you deserved another chance.

39:47.218 --> 39:50.679
That's right. He fought for you .

39:50.764 --> 39:52.139
I don't know what to say.

39:52.223 --> 39:53.348
Say nothing .

39:53.433 --> 39:56.393
You're here because
of Don Draper's largesse.

39:56.478 --> 39:58.896
Thank you . Thank you so much.

39:58.980 --> 40:01.732
Now, I know that your generation
went to college instead of serving ,

40:01.816 --> 40:02.983
so I'll illuminate you :

40:03.068 --> 40:04.318
this man is your commanding officer.

40:04.402 --> 40:07.821
You live and die in his shadow.

40:07.906 --> 40:09.448
Understood?

40:11.743 --> 40:13.285
I won't let you down , Don .

40:13.369 --> 40:15.913
Jesus, Campbell.

40:15.997 --> 40:17.998
Don't ever say that.

40:32.806 --> 40:36.517
I bet daily friendship with that bottle
attracts more people to advertising

40:36.601 --> 40:38.644
than any salary you can dream of.

40:38.728 --> 40:40.354
It's why I got in .

40:40.438 --> 40:42.314
So enjoy it.

40:43.399 --> 40:44.650
I'm doing my best here.

40:44.734 --> 40:45.859
Oh , you're not.

40:45.944 --> 40:48.403
You don't know how to drink,
your whole generation .

40:48.488 --> 40:49.947
You drink for the wrong reasons.

40:50.031 --> 40:54.284
My generation ,
we drink because it's good .

40:54.369 --> 40:56.912
Because it feels better
than unbuttoning your collar.

40:56.996 --> 40:59.373
Because we deserve it.

40:59.457 --> 41:02.042
We drink because it's what men do.

41:02.127 --> 41:03.335
What about shaky hands?

41:03.419 --> 41:06.088
I see a lot of that, too, with you boys.

41:06.172 --> 41:09.466
No joke. Your kind with your gloomy
thoughts and your worries,

41:09.551 --> 41:12.469
you're all busy licking
some imaginary wound .

41:12.554 --> 41:14.888
Not all imaginary.

41:14.973 --> 41:16.557
Yeah, boo-hoo.

41:18.726 --> 41:21.937
Maybe I'm not as comfortable
being powerless as you are.

41:24.858 --> 41:26.108
Pardon?

41:30.196 --> 41:31.989
You know, you shouldn't
compete with Pete Campbell.

41:32.073 --> 41:33.073
I'm not.

41:33.158 --> 41:34.408
Yeah . You are.

41:34.492 --> 41:38.453
Not at a personal level,
but for the world .

41:44.878 --> 41:46.044
I don't know.

41:46.129 --> 41:49.464
Maybe every generation thinks
the next one is the end of it all.

41:57.599 --> 42:00.058
I bet there are people in the Bible

42:00.143 --> 42:02.644
walking around complaining
about kids today.

42:05.565 --> 42:09.443
Kids today, they have
no one to look up to. . .

42:09.527 --> 42:12.404
because they're looking up to us.

42:17.785 --> 42:20.412
Of course, if you're not
going to have live-in help,

42:20.496 --> 42:23.040
that back room can be used
for any number of things.

42:23.124 --> 42:26.251
I don't think we'll be having live-in help
just yet, do you , sweetheart?

42:26.336 --> 42:28.795
No, I think we'll be
managing on our own for now.

42:30.590 --> 42:34.301
Oh , I'm so glad you could come.

42:34.385 --> 42:36.053
I'd like you to meet
Mrs. Clifford Lyman .

42:36.137 --> 42:37.512
She'll be one
of your new neighbors,

42:37.597 --> 42:39.431
and she's on the co-op board .

42:39.515 --> 42:41.767
Of course you know these two.

42:41.851 --> 42:43.352
Where's the nursery at?

42:43.436 --> 42:44.436
Thank you , Tom .

42:44.520 --> 42:46.063
I don't want to hear that again .

42:46.147 --> 42:47.147
Mrs. Lyman , Trudy Campbell .

42:47.232 --> 42:48.690
So nice to meet you .

42:48.775 --> 42:49.858
Well, aren't you darling?

42:49.943 --> 42:51.360
The two of you .

42:51.444 --> 42:53.028
A pleasure.

42:53.112 --> 42:55.447
Now, I know I shouldn't ask, but I have to.

42:55.531 --> 42:57.407
Your mother-in-law was just telling me

42:57.492 --> 43:00.452
that your great-great-grandfather
was a farmer with Isaac Roosevelt?

43:00.536 --> 43:01.745
Is that right?

43:01.829 --> 43:03.914
U m , yes. That's true.

43:03.998 --> 43:07.459
That was Nicholas Dykeman , right?

43:07.543 --> 43:09.461
On his mother's side.

43:09.545 --> 43:12.464
Can you imagine orchards
on 204th Street?

43:12.548 --> 43:14.925
He's buried at the Church
of the Intercession .

43:15.009 --> 43:17.761
Oh, my goodness,
Wait until I tell my husband

43:17.845 --> 43:19.846
there's going to be a Dykeman
living in the building .

43:19.931 --> 43:21.807
He'll be so thrilled .

43:21.891 --> 43:25.686
Sweetheart, tell Mrs, Lyman
the story about your great-great aunt

43:25.770 --> 43:28.021
getting in that fight
with the British soldier and the Hessian .

43:28.106 --> 43:29.648
You tell it, dear.

43:29.732 --> 43:32.067
You tell it so much better than I do.

43:32.151 --> 43:35.237
Well, I think it was
his great-great aunt,

43:35.321 --> 43:37.489
or great-great-great-- I'm not sure--

43:37.573 --> 43:39.741
but it was before
the Revolutionary War,

43:39.826 --> 43:42.494
and the Dykemans owned
