09:47.578 --> 09:49.884
Maybe you should shoot a little lower.

09:49.917 --> 09:52.684
You know, what about that, um,
that girl that works in post?

09:52.717 --> 09:54.021
What about her?

09:54.054 --> 09:55.854
You mean the one with the lazy eye?

09:55.887 --> 09:58.789
Hey, her eye may be lazy, but
that girl works her ass off.

09:58.822 --> 10:01.522
When was the last time
you jerked off to a girl

10:01.555 --> 10:03.459
because she was a hard worker?

10:03.492 --> 10:06.567
Melanie drives me crazy.
She... she gets me so hot.

10:06.600 --> 10:09.565
- I beat off to her at work today.
- Oh, shit.

10:09.606 --> 10:11.540
You know, that's very
dangerous to masturbate at work.

10:11.573 --> 10:13.236
You should talk to your
Uncle Charlie about that.

10:13.270 --> 10:14.772
It's not safe, and it's fucking disgusting.

10:14.805 --> 10:16.244
- Hey!
- What's wrong with you?

10:16.277 --> 10:17.979
- Fuck you.
- Don't jerk off at work.

10:18.012 --> 10:19.906
Fuck you. Fuck you.

10:19.946 --> 10:21.577
I think the director's
trying to get in there.

10:21.610 --> 10:22.913
What?

10:22.946 --> 10:24.880
That little worm, that fucking hack?

10:24.913 --> 10:27.415
You got the Moody blood
running through your veins.

10:27.448 --> 10:29.414
You can't let that
little worm get in the way

10:29.447 --> 10:31.213
of you and all your masturbatory daydreams.

10:31.254 --> 10:33.821
She's way out of both your leagues anyway.

10:33.854 --> 10:36.327
Yeah, but he's gonna win. He's a director.

10:36.360 --> 10:38.329
No, he's a TV director,

10:38.362 --> 10:40.266
and you're on your way up the ladder.

10:40.299 --> 10:41.666
Granted, you're using a footstool

10:41.700 --> 10:43.236
and barely holding on to the first rung,

10:43.269 --> 10:45.005
but he's stuck in the middle.

10:45.038 --> 10:47.509
Eventually he's just gonna
fall off and die screaming.

10:47.542 --> 10:49.910
I don't know how that little
fuck keeps getting jobs.

10:49.943 --> 10:51.846
- I don't know either.
- He must have film somewhere

10:51.879 --> 10:54.079
of Stu riding the Sybian or something.

10:54.120 --> 10:56.783
- I think I'd like to see that.
- Yeah, me too.

10:56.816 --> 10:57.855
Whoo! I got it!

10:57.888 --> 10:59.687
I got the part! I got the part!

10:59.722 --> 11:01.459
Congrats. Way to go.

11:01.492 --> 11:03.103
Whoo!

11:03.137 --> 11:06.003
All right, congrats. Way to go.

11:06.044 --> 11:07.476
I'd like to think my little pep talk

11:07.509 --> 11:08.780
had something to do with it...

11:08.813 --> 11:10.211
That and the shotgun.

11:10.244 --> 11:11.977
[Inhales sharply] What's wrong?

11:12.010 --> 11:14.147
- Nothing.
- Aren't you happy for me?

11:14.180 --> 11:15.850
Are you kidding me? It's awesome.

11:15.883 --> 11:18.448
Not only am I a 21-year-old
guy who lives with his mother.

11:18.481 --> 11:20.050
Now I'm a 21-year-old guy
who works with his mother.

11:20.091 --> 11:21.987
It's so cool.

11:22.021 --> 11:23.796
Oh, and then there's the fact
we moved all the way out here

11:23.829 --> 11:25.292
to launch my acting career,

11:25.325 --> 11:26.892
and you're the one who lucks into a job.

11:26.933 --> 11:28.468
Good for you, mom. Good for you.

11:28.501 --> 11:30.797
Hey, stop being such a
snotty little killjoy.

11:30.838 --> 11:32.502
This is your mother's happy day.

11:32.535 --> 11:35.673
- Yeah, what he said.
- I'm sorry.

11:35.714 --> 11:37.879
Come on, let's celebrate. It's great.

11:37.912 --> 11:39.742
- You go have fun, you two.
- You're happy for me.

11:39.775 --> 11:41.645
- Let's have dinner.
- Here, get the door. Just shut it.

11:41.678 --> 11:43.349
- Wait. Can Hank come?
- No.

11:43.382 --> 11:45.046
Oh, I'm sure Hank has better things to do.

11:45.087 --> 11:47.382
No, no, I got to work
on my 85-page outline

11:47.423 --> 11:48.748
<i>for Santa Monica Cop.</i>

11:48.789 --> 11:50.315
New career high, by the way.

11:50.356 --> 11:51.724
Come on, Hank. Don't be such a killjoy.

11:51.757 --> 11:53.823
It's mom's happy day. Right?

11:53.864 --> 11:55.160
Oh, all right.

11:55.193 --> 11:56.600
- Whoo!
- Come on, get in.

11:56.633 --> 11:59.262
Tight squeeze back here.

12:03.135 --> 12:04.701
To the city of angels,

12:04.734 --> 12:07.604
where it turns out dreams
actually do come true.

12:07.637 --> 12:09.237
Tell that to all the brokenhearted starlets

12:09.270 --> 12:11.741
who got chewed up, spit
out, and f'd in the "A"

12:11.774 --> 12:12.774
atop the Hollywood sign.

12:12.815 --> 12:14.214
- Cheers.
- [Glasses clink]

12:14.247 --> 12:16.382
- Cheers.
- I love this city. Whoo-hoo!

12:16.415 --> 12:19.082
Okay, okay, go easy there, ma.
She can't handle her alcohol.

12:19.115 --> 12:21.249
I beg to differ. Back in the
day, your mom could drink.

12:21.282 --> 12:22.852
That's right.

12:22.885 --> 12:24.421
I could drink you under
the table, motherfucker.

12:24.455 --> 12:25.896
Maybe I just like getting
you under the table.

12:25.929 --> 12:28.064
- Motherfucker.
- Oh, gross.

12:28.097 --> 12:29.528
Get a room, you two.

12:29.561 --> 12:32.096
Jesus.

12:32.136 --> 12:33.631
You know what?

12:33.664 --> 12:35.438
There are some seriously
hot bitches here tonight.

12:35.471 --> 12:37.135
- This is great.
- Who are you right now?

12:37.168 --> 12:39.104
What have I told you about trying too hard?

12:39.137 --> 12:40.440
You know, anybody can be a dick.

12:40.473 --> 12:41.973
Be a gentleman.

12:42.006 --> 12:43.276
- Yeah, what she said.
- Thank you.

12:43.309 --> 12:44.475
Excellent parenting.

12:44.508 --> 12:46.077
Shit.

12:46.110 --> 12:47.707
- [Both]: What?
- It's Melanie.

12:47.747 --> 12:50.609
What's so bad about that? He likes Melanie.

12:50.642 --> 12:53.046
- Shut up.
- Will you tell me? I want to hear all about it.

12:53.080 --> 12:55.216
They need me back at the
office. You got to drive me.

12:55.249 --> 12:57.218
Oh, no, we're just getting started.

12:57.251 --> 12:59.584
We're gonna raise the roof!
Come on, let's play some pool!

12:59.617 --> 13:01.423
Mom, this is my job
we're talking about here.

13:01.456 --> 13:02.792
They tell me to jump. I got to jump.

13:02.825 --> 13:03.761
It's show business.

13:03.794 --> 13:05.457
Can I pee first?

13:05.498 --> 13:09.498
- Permission granted. Bring back a sample.
- [Laughs]

13:09.531 --> 13:11.466
So what's the move here?

13:11.499 --> 13:13.904
If I find myself alone with
her, you know, what do I do?

13:13.937 --> 13:16.641
- You really like this girl?
- Pretty much, yeah.

13:16.674 --> 13:18.273
Then just make your intentions known,

13:18.306 --> 13:19.843
and don't be creepy about it.

13:19.876 --> 13:21.612
Don't whip out your dick
or anything like that.

13:21.645 --> 13:23.645
- Why would I take my dick out?
- Because... Well, your mom and I spoke.

13:23.686 --> 13:25.451
Shut... It was a phase.

13:25.484 --> 13:27.586
Why did she tell you that?

13:27.619 --> 13:28.987
I'm impressed.

13:29.020 --> 13:30.652
I could totally see us working together.

13:30.693 --> 13:32.359
That is music to my ears, Goldie.

13:32.392 --> 13:34.294
You just say the word,

13:34.327 --> 13:36.463
and I will start working to
make your dreams come true.

13:36.496 --> 13:38.096
Tell me something.

13:38.136 --> 13:39.831
What are some of your immediate goals?

13:39.872 --> 13:42.101
You know what I want more than anything?

13:42.134 --> 13:44.175
- Hmm?
- To run the fucking show.

13:44.208 --> 13:45.839
Rath is a hack.

13:45.872 --> 13:48.277
He's just coasting on
his resume at this point.

13:48.310 --> 13:50.211
I mean, if he would just listen to me,

13:50.244 --> 13:51.876
we could totally fucking crush it,

13:51.909 --> 13:53.508
but his head is so far up his own ass

13:53.549 --> 13:55.475
that he can't hear what
anyone else is saying.

13:55.516 --> 13:57.284
I find myself just sitting in meetings,

13:57.317 --> 14:00.720
like, nodding my head at every
stupid fucking idea he has.

14:00.761 --> 14:03.191
You know what I mean?

14:03.224 --> 14:05.358
You help me get the
show out from under Rath,

14:05.391 --> 14:07.495
and I'm all yours. What do you say?

14:07.528 --> 14:10.168
It sounds kind of devious, actually.

14:10.201 --> 14:12.200
I know, right?

14:12.233 --> 14:14.905
So all I have to do is
break up with "Old Balls."

14:14.938 --> 14:18.870
- Oh, unpleasant.
- But necessary.

14:18.903 --> 14:21.375
- I have a confession to make.
- Oh, what's that?

14:21.408 --> 14:23.246
Before the meeting,

14:23.279 --> 14:26.245
I went on RedTube and watched
your masturbation video.

14:26.278 --> 14:28.551
[Sighs] I'm sorry about that.

14:28.584 --> 14:30.319
I've been trying to get
them to take it down,

14:30.352 --> 14:32.388
but apparently it still gets a lot of hits.

14:32.454 --> 14:36.216
Don't apologize. It's kind of hot.

14:36.249 --> 14:39.688
I mean, there is nothing

14:39.721 --> 14:42.191
limp dick about you, Charlie.

15:18.752 --> 15:22.285
[Moaning]

15:24.653 --> 15:27.661
[Groaning]

15:30.293 --> 15:33.297
[Breathing heavily]

15:43.304 --> 15:45.637
So what kind of cleanup
am I looking at in there?

15:45.670 --> 15:49.676
I don't know what you're insinuating.

15:58.977 --> 16:00.815
Thanks for celebrating with us.

16:00.848 --> 16:02.783
I think it really meant a lot to Levon.

16:02.816 --> 16:05.416
Sure. I was happy to.

16:05.449 --> 16:07.489
You know, you deserve a little stardust.

16:07.522 --> 16:09.952
- You do.
- Thanks, Hank.

16:09.993 --> 16:11.993
I think your pep talk really helped.

16:12.026 --> 16:13.498
- Sure.
- Good night.

16:13.531 --> 16:15.469
And I probably shouldn't say this out loud,

16:15.502 --> 16:18.641
but apparently that's what I do, so I will.

16:18.674 --> 16:20.744
But you do realize that Rath

16:20.777 --> 16:23.311
might have certain expectations now, right?

16:23.344 --> 16:26.782
- What are you talking about?
- Well, he did give you the job.

16:26.815 --> 16:30.751
Are you saying that he
expects me to have sex with him

16:30.784 --> 16:32.519
or give him a blow job?

16:32.552 --> 16:34.590
I'm sure he'd enjoy either
one of those options.

16:34.623 --> 16:36.318
He does find you pretty foxy.

16:36.359 --> 16:39.022
Well, he said I was very natural.

16:39.055 --> 16:40.423
You are very natural.

16:40.464 --> 16:43.696
You are. You're also... you're very naive.

16:43.730 --> 16:47.537
Jeez, maybe I should turn it down.

16:47.570 --> 16:49.936
No... don't cut off your
boobs to spite your chest

16:49.969 --> 16:51.209
or something like that.

16:51.242 --> 16:53.274
I'm just trying to make you aware

16:53.307 --> 16:55.881
that the boss man might
have a crush on you.

16:55.914 --> 16:57.609
You know, you could do a lot worse.

16:57.650 --> 16:59.345
I mean, the guy's a serious fucking earner.

16:59.385 --> 17:01.153
He has really nice teeth.

17:01.186 --> 17:03.888
And he's got really nice teeth.

17:03.921 --> 17:06.224
- Smile.
- Do I have to?

17:06.258 --> 17:08.289
You have something between
your lateral incisor

17:08.321 --> 17:09.560
- and your canine.
- I know. Ah.

17:09.594 --> 17:11.395
Looks like a little hamburger meat.

17:11.428 --> 17:12.896
- Gone now.
- Thank you.

17:12.930 --> 17:14.191
Look at these choppers.

17:14.232 --> 17:15.526
They could really use a good cleaning.

17:15.559 --> 17:16.830
Okay, I'll make an appointment.

17:16.864 --> 17:18.397
I will. I'll make an appointment.

17:18.431 --> 17:20.566
- You should. - Mm-hmm.
I will, right away.

17:20.598 --> 17:22.396
You know, I'm not really
ready to call it a night.

17:22.435 --> 17:24.869
No? All right, I'm game.

17:24.903 --> 17:26.501
Let's do it.

17:26.541 --> 17:28.373
Just tell me where to point this lead sled.

17:28.406 --> 17:29.845
- Okay.
- [Engine revs]

17:29.878 --> 17:31.573
I'm waiting.

17:34.718 --> 17:36.848
So...

17:36.889 --> 17:39.354
- Does Rath ever hit on you?
- No.

17:39.387 --> 17:42.531
I gave him a killer blow
job when I first got here.

17:42.564 --> 17:44.195
He's left me alone ever since.

17:44.228 --> 17:45.729
- Really?
- Yeah.

17:45.762 --> 17:48.402
That's smart, I guess.

17:48.435 --> 17:51.338
[Laughs] Dude, I'm kidding.

17:51.371 --> 17:53.875
[Chuckles] Of course you are.

17:55.476 --> 17:59.408
So what... what makes
your blow jobs so killer?

17:59.441 --> 18:01.238
Well, wouldn't you like to know?

18:01.279 --> 18:04.412
- I would, yeah.
- You're funny.

18:04.445 --> 18:07.212
Anyway, Rath has been through a bunch

18:07.245 --> 18:08.845
of sexual harassment lawsuits,

18:08.885 --> 18:11.452
so he's pretty much
learned to behave himself.

18:11.485 --> 18:14.084
I mean, I-I do catch him staring
at my tits here and there,

18:14.117 --> 18:15.357
but that's okay.

18:15.390 --> 18:16.760
You know, I take it as a compliment.

18:16.793 --> 18:18.424
You totally should.

18:18.464 --> 18:22.568
One, two, three, eyes on me.

18:22.602 --> 18:24.570
- Hey, Mel.
- Hey, you.

18:24.603 --> 18:29.042
Can you, uh, run out and get
me a nonfat vanilla latte, kid?

18:29.075 --> 18:31.878
Yeah. I really don't work for you, so...

18:31.911 --> 18:33.783
Yeah, but you work for the show, right?

18:33.816 --> 18:35.614
Yeah, so?

18:35.655 --> 18:36.981
So, if you work for the
show, you work for me,

18:37.022 --> 18:38.989
because I direct the show.

18:39.022 --> 18:42.653
Well, you directed the pilot,
except for the reshoots.

18:42.694 --> 18:45.156
I guess they had to bring in
someone else for those, right?

18:45.189 --> 18:50.102
Come here.

18:50.135 --> 18:52.000
[Whispering] Look, I have
laid a lot of groundwork

18:52.040 --> 18:53.935
with this girl... we're
talking weeks of prep.

18:53.968 --> 18:55.470
You are not gonna fuck this up for me.

18:55.503 --> 18:56.944
I know you think

18:56.977 --> 18:59.177
I'm just swinging my big, fat dick around.

18:59.210 --> 19:01.313
But the truth is I'm actually
seeing a few steps ahead.

19:01.346 --> 19:03.448
No matter what happens between her and me,

19:03.481 --> 19:04.751
it's gonna end badly.

19:04.784 --> 19:06.151
I know that going in.

19:06.184 --> 19:08.119
I accept it as the cost of doing business.

19:08.152 --> 19:11.621
But you... you could be
like the shoulder to cry on.

19:11.654 --> 19:14.294
- See where I'm going with this?
- Yeah. And you're full of shit.

19:14.327 --> 19:15.959
And you could use an altoid.

19:15.992 --> 19:18.294
[Normal voice] Vanilla latte.

19:18.327 --> 19:22.798
Get her one too, and, uh,
don't be too quick about it.

19:22.832 --> 19:24.303
Hello.

19:24.336 --> 19:27.135
I can't tell you how not into this I am.

19:27.168 --> 19:29.271
Oh, don't be such a pussy.
It's just a cleaning.

19:29.304 --> 19:31.008
Yes, but you've been drinking.

19:31.041 --> 19:32.681
You probably shouldn't be
handling dental equipment

19:32.714 --> 19:33.945
under the influence.

19:33.978 --> 19:35.850
What are you so afraid of?

19:35.883 --> 19:37.482
<i>You've seen Raiders of the Lost Ark.</i>

19:37.515 --> 19:39.187
Yeah.

19:39.220 --> 19:40.788
You know how Indiana Jones
is this all-around badass?

19:40.821 --> 19:42.060
- Mm-hmm. - He's literate.
He's smart.

19:42.093 --> 19:43.524
He's good with the whip,

19:43.557 --> 19:45.200
great with the ladies,
a little like me, right?

19:45.233 --> 19:46.799
But he's definitely afraid of snakes.

19:46.832 --> 19:48.334
Okay, so?

19:48.367 --> 19:49.868
I'm definitely afraid of dentists.

19:49.901 --> 19:51.300
- Oh.
- That dude is my snakes.

19:51.333 --> 19:53.004
Oh.

19:53.037 --> 19:54.740
<i>Once, I saw Marathon
Man when I was younger,</i>

19:54.773 --> 19:56.205
and I had nightmares for weeks.

19:56.238 --> 19:57.709
I wet the bed after that,

19:57.742 --> 19:59.374
which is way hotter when a woman does it.

19:59.415 --> 20:02.381
I'm gonna clean your teeth. Whoo!

20:02.414 --> 20:03.873
Say, "You're a really good director."

20:03.914 --> 20:05.512
You're a really good director.

20:05.545 --> 20:07.879
Say... say, "You're a feature director."

20:07.912 --> 20:09.415
You are a feature director. You are.

20:09.448 --> 20:11.477
Yeah, that's right. I
am a feature director.

20:11.518 --> 20:13.412
- I am.
- Yes, you are.

20:13.453 --> 20:16.620
Oh, I'm just doing television
because it pays good,

20:16.653 --> 20:18.556
- but I'm close. Oh!
- Oh, yeah.

20:18.589 --> 20:20.850
I'm close. I'm close to having a feature.

20:20.891 --> 20:22.922
- Oh, yeah. You're so close.
- Oh, Jesus, this is awful.

20:22.955 --> 20:24.858
I'm not gonna be able to un-see this shit.

20:24.891 --> 20:26.730
Leave the lattes and
get the fuck out of here.

20:26.763 --> 20:28.098
Oh.

20:28.131 --> 20:30.762
Oh, my God. Oh.

20:30.795 --> 20:32.235
Oh, shit.

20:32.268 --> 20:33.266
You shouldn't be doing this, Melanie.

20:33.300 --> 20:35.066
You deserve so much better.

20:35.099 --> 20:36.834
He's on his way down. I'm on my way up.

20:36.874 --> 20:38.673
- Says who?
- My father.

20:38.707 --> 20:41.377
I knew it. That fucking guy...

20:41.410 --> 20:44.409
he lives to fuck my shit up!
He's such a fucking asshole!

20:44.443 --> 20:46.115
Hey, that's my father you're talking about!

20:46.148 --> 20:49.020
Yeah, your father is a fucking asshole!

20:49.053 --> 20:50.285
You're a dick. You know that?

20:50.318 --> 20:51.523
You're the dick.

20:51.556 --> 20:54.416
- You.
- I hate you.

20:54.457 --> 20:58.227
- You're a dick!
- Your dad is ruining my life.

20:58.260 --> 21:00.425
- Get off me.
- God damn it.

21:00.459 --> 21:02.426
What the fuck? You have a gun in there?

21:02.467 --> 21:05.700
- Smell my finger.
- Ow. No, never!

21:05.732 --> 21:08.769
- Smell my fingers.
- God, fuck me, man.

21:08.802 --> 21:13.105
- Fucking asshole.
- You're a sick bastard.

21:13.138 --> 21:15.704
I can't believe you're
into that guy, Melanie.

21:15.744 --> 21:17.310
He... he's on his way down.

21:17.343 --> 21:19.277
I'm on my way up the ladder. I'm climbing.

21:19.310 --> 21:23.149
I don't mean this the way
it sounds, but you're a PA.

21:23.182 --> 21:25.748
- He's directed movies.
- Shitty movies.

21:25.781 --> 21:27.482
And what other way could
that have possibly sounded?

21:27.515 --> 21:30.682
He owns a home and a car.

21:30.715 --> 21:32.450
That's what this is about... possessions?

21:32.483 --> 21:37.347
Anyone can buy stuff. Not
everyone has one of these.

21:39.587 --> 21:42.290
Oh.

21:42.323 --> 21:45.155
You have a surprisingly big dick.

21:45.196 --> 21:47.162
Thanks.

21:47.195 --> 21:51.297
Oh, but that doesn't make me
want to be with you, Levon.

21:59.036 --> 22:01.411
[Slurring] This is not as bad
as I thought it was gonna be.

22:01.444 --> 22:03.011
I told you so.

22:03.044 --> 22:04.443
You're really good at
the cleaning of teeth.

22:04.476 --> 22:06.346
Fucking "A" right I am.

22:06.379 --> 22:07.682
Can I have another hit of the nitrous?

22:07.715 --> 22:09.314
No. Come on. You've had enough.

22:09.347 --> 22:10.786
[Normal voice] You didn't
see me cutting you off

22:10.819 --> 22:13.120
when we were at the bar, did you?

22:13.153 --> 22:14.320
Close your mouth.

22:14.353 --> 22:15.816
You know, you got to see a dentist

22:15.856 --> 22:17.688
on a more regular basis.

22:17.721 --> 22:20.455
I can't stress it enough how
important good oral hygiene is.

22:20.488 --> 22:21.823
[Slurring] Stop saying that.

22:21.855 --> 22:23.696
- What?
- "Oral." It's turning me on.

22:23.730 --> 22:26.266
Ha ha ha.

22:26.299 --> 22:27.929
It's good to know I still turn you on.

22:27.970 --> 22:29.337
There's nothing about you

22:29.370 --> 22:30.665
that wouldn't turn a person on, lady.

22:30.706 --> 22:32.137
- Really?
- Mm.

22:32.170 --> 22:33.602
It doesn't feel that way sometimes.

22:33.643 --> 22:36.644
[Normal voice] No serious
relationships ever?

22:36.677 --> 22:38.642
I mean, there were a few things

22:38.676 --> 22:41.546
that might have been something,
but Levon always got in the way.

22:41.579 --> 22:44.018
I just... I wanted to find
somebody who could embrace him

22:44.051 --> 22:45.880
for who he is and also, you know,

22:45.921 --> 22:48.818
play an active role in his life,
but I guess that's a lot to ask.

22:48.859 --> 22:50.226
Hmm.

22:50.259 --> 22:51.823
Well, this could be the nitrous talking,

22:51.856 --> 22:53.319
but I think he's kind of a great kid.

22:53.359 --> 22:55.895
He's really... he's kind of awesome

22:55.928 --> 22:58.126
in an initially off-putting kind of way.

22:58.159 --> 22:59.558
- It's weird.
- I know, right?

22:59.599 --> 23:01.294
- He's a really good kid.
- Yeah.

23:01.335 --> 23:02.798
He's got a great heart.

23:02.831 --> 23:04.968
Well, he gets that from you, from his mom.

23:05.001 --> 23:06.704
- Well, that's not fair.
- What?

23:06.737 --> 23:08.842
You're just complimenting
me on my mothering skills

23:08.875 --> 23:10.844
when I'm so close to you?

23:10.877 --> 23:13.515
[Both chuckle]

23:25.122 --> 23:27.362
This is... is probably not a good idea.

23:27.395 --> 23:30.696
- It's a terrible idea.
- Terrible idea.

23:32.528 --> 23:36.431
[Cell phone ringing]

23:36.464 --> 23:38.200
[Groans]

23:38.240 --> 23:41.004
[Scoffs] It's Levon. That figures.

23:41.037 --> 23:42.668
He's always been such
a little cock blocker.

23:42.701 --> 23:45.107
- Should I rinse?
- Yeah, rinse.

23:45.140 --> 23:46.571
What's wrong, honey?

23:46.604 --> 23:48.106
You told me to make my intentions known.

23:48.139 --> 23:50.072
Yeah, I also told you
not to take your dick out.

23:50.105 --> 23:51.608
I specifically said that.

23:51.641 --> 23:53.512
I know. I got carried away. I'm sorry.

23:53.545 --> 23:55.080
You think?

23:55.113 --> 23:57.080
I did not raise you to
threaten women with your penis.

23:57.113 --> 23:58.512
I wasn't threatening her, okay?

23:58.552 --> 23:59.847
I was showing it to her.

23:59.880 --> 24:01.448
I thought it might make a difference.

24:01.489 --> 24:03.217
Whatever. I-I should've known better.

24:03.258 --> 24:05.425
No one I like ever likes me back anyways.

24:05.458 --> 24:07.528
I'm not saying what he did is right,

24:07.561 --> 24:09.562
but I get where he's coming from.

24:09.595 --> 24:12.099
You know, he's a guy. He
just wants to get laid.

24:12.132 --> 24:14.601
- It's totally normal.
- Oh, yeah, it's normal,

24:14.634 --> 24:16.767
but it's disgusting, and it's illegal.

24:16.800 --> 24:19.441
Yeah, it's all those things too.

24:19.474 --> 24:21.444
But what is that about?

24:21.477 --> 24:25.073
I mean, is... is... is
it handsome and special?

24:25.114 --> 24:27.115
- It's pretty big.
- Oh.

24:27.148 --> 24:28.379
Like father, like son...

24:28.419 --> 24:30.218
Unless big dicks run in your family too.

24:30.251 --> 24:31.819
He could have your big dick.

24:31.852 --> 24:34.453
Now, where were we before
we were so rudely interrupted

24:34.493 --> 24:36.627
by your son's overwhelming
need to expose himself?

24:36.660 --> 24:38.962
<i>My son? Our son.</i>

24:38.995 --> 24:41.227
I thought you said it was too soon.

24:41.260 --> 24:43.959
Speaking of too soon,

24:43.992 --> 24:46.632
what happened before...
that can't happen again.

24:46.665 --> 24:49.167
I agree. Too confusing.

24:49.200 --> 24:51.302
What happens in the dentist's office

24:51.335 --> 24:53.438
stays in the dentist's office.

24:53.471 --> 24:55.836
So you're saying it can only
happen in a dentist's office?

24:55.869 --> 24:57.436
[Both laugh] No, no, I get it.

24:57.469 --> 24:59.571
- I'm just kidding.
- I'm not saying that.

24:59.604 --> 25:01.473
I know. And I'm gonna have a talk with him,

25:01.506 --> 25:03.304
you know, about girls,

25:03.337 --> 25:05.640
and try to make sure he doesn't
get arrested for something.

25:05.673 --> 25:10.082
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

25:10.115 --> 25:12.482
It was a pleasure
co-parenting with you tonight,

25:12.515 --> 25:15.755
and I'm gonna hit the road
before the nitrous wears off.

25:15.788 --> 25:19.091
Do you have any more of
that stuff from this morning?

25:19.124 --> 25:22.964
- That stuff?
- Mmm.
