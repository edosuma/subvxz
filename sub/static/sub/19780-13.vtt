that the stress will kill you?

In your case, Elias, it is actually true.

I know, Dr. Bell. I know.

He used to be a good boy.

He won the Read Around the World contest

09:42.694 --> 09:44.227

And by "good boy,"
she means "social misfit."

- Just like I was at his age.

09:48.199 --> 09:50.099
So what changed?

09:50.101 --> 09:51.834
Well, he finally started putting on weight,

09:51.836 --> 09:53.069
so that was good.

09:53.071 --> 09:54.470
- But then...
- Mood swings.

that way in high school.

You're the same age,

What put you on
such different trajectories?

Well, my parents always
pushed me to get good grades,

Ah, they lived overseas,

with an older cousin,

up in a different direction.
