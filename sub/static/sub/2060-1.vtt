02:06.545 --> 02:07.385
<i><font color="#ff8000">Listen to me, darling</font></i>

02:07.504 --> 02:07.711

02:07.712 --> 02:07.921

02:08.128 --> 02:08.545
<i><font color="#ff8000">I wake up every</font> morning</i>

02:08.547 --> 02:09.088
<i><font color="#ff8000">I wake up every morning</font></i>

02:09.214 --> 02:09.589
<i><font color="#ff8000">Thinking</font> about the way you feel</i>

02:09.589 --> 02:09.881

02:09.881 --> 02:10.048

<i><font color="#ff8000">Thinking about the way</font> you feel</i>

02:10.215 --> 02:10.465
<i><font color="#ff8000">Thinking about the way you</font> feel</i>

02:10.466 --> 02:11.706
<i><font color="#ff8000">Thinking about the way you feel</font></i>

02:13.551 --> 02:13.801
<i><font color="#ff8000">I</font> wonder if you know it</i>

02:13.802 --> 02:14.092

02:14.093 --> 02:14.385

02:14.385 --> 02:14.552
<i><font color="#ff8000">I wonder if you</font> know it</i>

02:14.552 --> 02:14.844

02:14.845 --> 02:15.486
<i><font color="#ff8000">I wonder if you know it</font></i>

02:16.470 --> 02:17.179

02:17.180 --> 02:17.472

<i><font color="#ff8000">Listen to me now</font></i>

02:20.183 --> 02:20.683
<i><font color="#ff8000">What</font> good is love?</i>

02:20.684 --> 02:21.224
<i><font color="#ff8000">What good</font> is love?</i>

02:21.226 --> 02:21.560
<i><font color="#ff8000">What good is</font> love?</i>

02:21.561 --> 02:22.281
<i><font color="#ff8000">What good is love?</font></i>

02:23.561 --> 02:24.144
<i><font color="#ff8000">If</font> it's not your love</i>

02:24.145 --> 02:24.686
<i><font color="#ff8000">If it's</font> not your love</i>

02:24.687 --> 02:25.187
<i><font color="#ff8000">If it's not</font> your love</i>

<i><font color="#ff8000">If it's not your</font> love</i>

02:25.564 --> 02:26.856
<i><font color="#ff8000">If it's not your love</font></i>

02:30.068 --> 02:32.904
For a bird from Minnesota,
you've got some moves.

02:33.071 --> 02:34.906
That wasn't a move.
That was an accident.

02:35.073 --> 02:36.407
But I accept the compliment.

02:36.616 --> 02:38.952
It's great Rafael could watch the kids.

02:39.118 --> 02:42.080
Yeah, it looks like
you're stuck with me all night.

02:42.247 --> 02:43.915
You're my one and only, Blu.

02:44.082 --> 02:47.627
That's a good thing,
since I'm the only other one.

02:47.794 --> 02:50.255
Hey, you lovebirds! Happy New Year!

02:50.421 --> 02:51.523
Rafi? Where are the...

02:51.548 --> 02:54.217
The kids are with Luiz. No worries!

02:54.384 --> 02:56.386
Worries. Right here.

02:59.472 --> 03:00.890
Luiz? Where are the kids?

03:01.057 --> 03:02.934
What? I don't have any kids.

03:03.101 --> 03:04.060
Our kids!

03:04.227 --> 03:06.437
Oh, right. I left them with Tiny.

03:06.604 --> 03:07.438
Tiny?

03:07.605 --> 03:10.525
What? She's an excellent babysitter.

03:10.859 --> 03:12.610
I'm a terrible babysitter!

03:12.777 --> 03:14.612
This is gonna be awesome!

03:14.779 --> 03:16.781
All right,
I've done all the calculations...

03:16.948 --> 03:19.534
and each explosion
will be perfectly synced to the beat.

03:19.701 --> 03:22.245
Unless I didn't carry the one.

03:22.412 --> 03:23.246
Here's my vision.

03:23.413 --> 03:26.207
Red, blue, green, yellow, yellow!
Purple.

03:26.374 --> 03:30.211
Here's my vision.
Boom! Crash! Bang! Kapow!

03:30.378 --> 03:32.797
I don't think your parents
would like this very much.

03:33.381 --> 03:35.049
Here we go.

03:36.426 --> 03:37.777
Where are you going, little bird?

03:37.802 --> 03:39.387
- Hey, what is this?
- Oh, Dad.

03:39.554 --> 03:40.613
Guys, you know the rules.

03:40.638 --> 03:42.765
No pyrotechnics
without adult supervision.

03:42.932 --> 03:44.100
We asked Tiny.

03:44.267 --> 03:45.643
That's even worse.
Sorry, Tiny.

03:45.810 --> 03:47.979
You don't have to pay me, Señor Blu.

03:48.146 --> 03:49.606
Kids, next time, ask me.

03:49.772 --> 03:51.316
But you always say "no."

03:51.482 --> 03:52.317
No, I don't.

03:52.483 --> 03:54.235
Dad, you're in denial.

03:54.402 --> 03:56.070
Honey, do I always say "no"?

03:56.237 --> 03:59.657
- Yes. I mean, no.
- Great.

03:59.824 --> 04:01.576
Now Mom's saying it, too.

04:03.828 --> 04:06.789
Listen, we are the last
blue Spix's Macaws left on the planet.

04:06.956 --> 04:09.626
We have to stay safe.
Birds of blue feathers...

04:09.792 --> 04:12.921
Have to stick together.

04:13.087 --> 04:14.172
I smell chicken.

04:16.925 --> 04:20.011
No, no, no!

04:20.928 --> 04:21.762
No, no, no!

04:22.305 --> 04:25.642
By my calculations,
that's his twenty-seventh "no" today.

04:30.688 --> 04:31.522
Help!

04:34.150 --> 04:39.364
- Five, four, three, two, one!
- Everybody, fly!

04:39.530 --> 04:40.990
Happy New Year!

04:50.208 --> 04:53.962
Oh, man.
How come Dad gets to have all the fun?

04:54.128 --> 04:56.881
Look! It worked!

04:57.048 --> 05:00.802
Well, this year is off to a great start.

05:20.321 --> 05:23.449
Amazon Expedition, day seven.

05:23.658 --> 05:25.243
Two thousand miles from Rio...

05:25.410 --> 05:27.090
we've reached the center
of the rainforest.

05:28.830 --> 05:31.249
We are surrounded
by plants and animals...

05:31.416 --> 05:33.668
struggling for survival...

05:33.835 --> 05:36.629
as we glide effortlessly down the river.

05:36.796 --> 05:39.007
Effortless for you.

05:39.674 --> 05:41.175
How pretty.

05:41.968 --> 05:43.845
Spit it out, spit it out!

05:45.388 --> 05:48.725
We are near the nesting grounds
of the Amazonian Wood Quail.

05:48.891 --> 05:50.810
<i>Odontophorus gujanensis.</i>

05:50.977 --> 05:53.187
Six months ago,
we rescued this little bird...

05:53.354 --> 05:54.772
from smugglers.

05:54.939 --> 05:56.774
It was sick, malnourished...

05:56.941 --> 05:59.193
with a broken leg, but now...

05:59.360 --> 06:00.778
my trusty assistant...

06:02.488 --> 06:06.242
I mean, loving wife and colleague,
will release her...

06:06.409 --> 06:08.244
back to her natural habitat.

06:08.411 --> 06:09.328
It's okay.

06:09.495 --> 06:10.955
You can go now.

06:11.122 --> 06:12.832
Just like this.

06:13.041 --> 06:14.208
Let me talk to her.

06:19.047 --> 06:20.214
Go on.

06:23.342 --> 06:24.635
FREAKS!

06:27.889 --> 06:29.891
Do you think she's gonna be all right?

06:30.058 --> 06:31.768
Give it some time.

06:40.902 --> 06:42.612
Welcome home.

06:47.325 --> 06:50.036
Wait a minute.
What is she saying, Tulio?

06:50.620 --> 06:52.789
It's just hard for her to say goodbye.

06:53.581 --> 06:54.582
No.

06:54.832 --> 06:56.375
I think she's trying to warn us.

06:56.793 --> 06:58.795
No, no, no, Linda.

06:58.961 --> 07:01.047
It might be some sort of mating dance.

07:09.138 --> 07:10.973
Tulio! Look!

07:11.390 --> 07:13.267
Paddle! Now!

07:13.768 --> 07:16.104
Okay, okay, okay. Paddle.

07:17.188 --> 07:18.314
Watch out!

07:19.482 --> 07:21.359
Paddle, paddle! Backward, backward!

07:21.526 --> 07:23.903
To the right! No, left!
Forward, forward! No, no!

07:24.070 --> 07:25.822
Make up your mind, Tulio!

07:28.366 --> 07:29.951
Cheese and sprinkles!

07:40.086 --> 07:41.420
Oh, no!

07:43.339 --> 07:44.882
Paddle, paddle! Faster!

07:45.633 --> 07:48.344
Tulio!

07:58.354 --> 08:00.648
Linda! Linda!

08:00.815 --> 08:02.191
Tulio!

08:07.989 --> 08:10.616
Thank heavens you're okay.

08:17.248 --> 08:18.958
Tulio, is that a...

08:41.688 --> 08:44.400
Linda! This is incredible!

09:12.887 --> 09:14.263
Good morning, Jewel!

09:23.773 --> 09:26.567
Hey! Everyone, look what I found.

09:26.734 --> 09:27.818
Blu?

09:28.653 --> 09:29.904
Kids?

09:30.071 --> 09:31.047
Where did everybody...?

09:31.072 --> 09:34.408
Okay, who's ready for some breakfast?

09:34.575 --> 09:35.910
Unbelievable.

09:38.496 --> 09:39.497
Did you know...

09:39.664 --> 09:42.083
that these whole wheat pancakes have
twice the vitamins and minerals...

09:42.250 --> 09:43.251
of regular pancakes?

09:43.417 --> 09:46.671
And with the blueberries,
it's four times as tasty.

09:48.839 --> 09:50.675
Hey, where are the blueberries?

09:50.841 --> 09:52.134
Oh, Dad!

09:52.301 --> 09:53.761
Looking for this?

09:54.178 --> 09:55.012
Bring it.

09:55.805 --> 09:58.199
It's down to the final minutes.
He's got magic in his feet!

09:58.224 --> 09:59.058
He shoots!

09:59.225 --> 10:00.851
- He scores! Goal!
- Goal!

10:01.686 --> 10:03.396
Yeah, I got it. I'm good.

10:03.562 --> 10:05.481
Heads up, Dad!

10:08.025 --> 10:09.318
No.

10:16.826 --> 10:18.202
Awesome.

10:21.747 --> 10:23.207
Hi, Mom.

10:24.333 --> 10:25.334
Busted.

10:25.501 --> 10:26.752
Time to go.

10:27.586 --> 10:29.213
Hey, honey. Hey. You hungry?

10:29.380 --> 10:31.424
Blu, we talked about this.

10:31.590 --> 10:32.550
Did we? I don't...

10:32.717 --> 10:34.385
Yeah, so, what do you got there?

10:34.552 --> 10:35.386
Breakfast.

10:35.553 --> 10:37.513
That's funny.
But seriously, what is that?

10:37.680 --> 10:39.223
It's a Brazil nut.

10:39.390 --> 10:41.590
I never thought I would find one
this close to the city.

10:41.600 --> 10:42.893
I wanna show the kids how to open one.

10:43.060 --> 10:44.061
You mean like this?

10:45.187 --> 10:46.605
Dad already showed us.

10:47.565 --> 10:49.358
Wait. Wait, go back.

10:49.525 --> 10:50.568
Mom! Dad!

10:50.735 --> 10:51.736
You're on TV!

10:51.902 --> 10:53.863
<i>Doctor Tulio Monteiro,
the Bird Man of Brazil...</i>

10:54.030 --> 10:56.240
<i>announced an important discovery today.</i>

10:56.407 --> 10:59.869
<i>We believe we have encountered
a wild blue Spix's Macaw...</i>

11:00.036 --> 11:01.620
<i>deep in the Amazon jungle.</i>

11:02.038 --> 11:06.000
<i>The blue Spix's Macaw
was thought to be practically extinct...</i>

11:06.167 --> 11:08.127
<i>with the last remaining family
living under protection...</i>

11:08.294 --> 11:10.254
<i>at the Blu Bird Sanctuary
in Rio de Janeiro.</i>

11:10.463 --> 11:11.756
We're famous!

11:11.922 --> 11:15.468
<i>If these birds can be found,
their home will be saved.</i>

11:15.634 --> 11:17.636
<i>There may be a whole flock out there.</i>

11:17.803 --> 11:21.432
<i>And if there is,
we will find them and protect them.</i>

11:21.599 --> 11:22.683
<i>Hi, Blu!</i>

11:23.100 --> 11:24.310
Hi, Linda!

11:24.769 --> 11:26.479
We're not the only ones.

11:27.813 --> 11:29.106
There are more of us out there.

11:29.273 --> 11:30.608
Yeah, that's great. I'm sure they're...

11:30.775 --> 11:32.943
All this time, I thought...

11:33.652 --> 11:36.113
I thought we were alone.

11:36.280 --> 11:38.282
Hey, it hasn't been all bad.

11:39.116 --> 11:41.410
Of course not.

11:41.577 --> 11:43.788
But just imagine
if there was a whole flock of us.

11:45.289 --> 11:46.791
How amazing would that be?

11:49.794 --> 11:51.253
- We gotta do something.
- We do?

11:51.420 --> 11:54.799
Yeah, we have to fly to the Amazon
and help Linda and Tulio find them!

11:54.965 --> 11:57.468
Whoa, we can't just pack up and go.

11:57.635 --> 11:58.344
Why not?

11:58.511 --> 12:01.639
It's about time this family
got a little air under our wings.

12:01.847 --> 12:05.976
Look at us. iPods, TV. Pancakes?

12:06.143 --> 12:09.688
We're not people, we're birds.

12:09.855 --> 12:12.316
We have to get out into the wild
and be birds, Blu.

12:12.483 --> 12:14.151
Let the kids connect to their roots.

12:14.318 --> 12:15.861
Show them what I had.

12:16.028 --> 12:18.030
They need this. We need this.

12:18.197 --> 12:19.990
Come on, Blu, what do you say?

12:20.616 --> 12:21.992
I don't know.

12:22.159 --> 12:23.160
Maybe.

12:23.327 --> 12:24.370
He didn't say "no."

12:24.537 --> 12:26.372
Which means he practically said "yes."

12:26.539 --> 12:28.516
- Hey, wait a Sec...
- It's gonna be so much fun!

12:28.541 --> 12:30.042
Yeah!

12:30.209 --> 12:32.336
We're going to the Amazon!

12:32.503 --> 12:35.131
Wait. What's the Amazon?

12:35.297 --> 12:38.509
<i>The Amazon is one of Earth's
most endangered ecosystems...</i>

12:38.676 --> 12:40.636
<i>due to illegal logging and farming.</i>

12:40.803 --> 12:42.805
<i>Let's hope Doctor Monteiro
and his team...</i>

12:42.972 --> 12:46.559
<i>can find these rare birds
so their home can be saved.</i>

12:46.725 --> 12:48.853
<i>There may be a whole flock out there.</i>

12:49.019 --> 12:52.523
<i>And if there is,
we will find them and protect them.</i>

12:53.274 --> 12:54.859
Tree huggers.

12:55.025 --> 12:56.694
Get my boat ready.

12:56.861 --> 13:00.030
I need to deal with this personally.

13:06.954 --> 13:07.663
Next!

13:07.830 --> 13:10.374
That would be me.
Okay, everybody can go home now.

13:10.541 --> 13:14.044
You're looking at the next
King of Carnival!

13:17.047 --> 13:19.383
Hey, big bird! Break a leg!

13:22.219 --> 13:24.138
Walk it off, buddy!

13:24.305 --> 13:27.183
<i>You can't see it coming</i>

13:27.349 --> 13:32.897
<i>You won't find it anywhere else</i>

13:39.904 --> 13:41.572
That was amazing!

13:41.739 --> 13:45.910
Eva, darling, you hit every note.
Huh, guys?

13:46.076 --> 13:49.413
Yeah, along with a bunch of notes
I never heard of.

13:49.580 --> 13:50.581
Rafi!

13:50.748 --> 13:52.917
Don't worry. I'll talk to them.

13:53.083 --> 13:55.252
We'll find the perfect spot for you.

13:55.586 --> 13:56.754
Antarctica, maybe.

13:56.921 --> 13:58.088
You better.

13:59.423 --> 14:00.674
Bye, boys.

14:00.841 --> 14:03.719
See you back at home, my tasty mango!

14:04.512 --> 14:07.765
None of these acts are inspiring.
I'm just not inspired.

14:07.932 --> 14:10.976
Carnival is right around the corner,
and our reputations are on the line.

14:11.143 --> 14:11.894
Copy that.

14:12.061 --> 14:14.730
We need something that can make us wiggle.
Something that make us jiggle.

14:14.897 --> 14:16.232
We need something that pops.

14:17.691 --> 14:19.652
You know what "pop" is backwards?
Pop.

14:19.818 --> 14:20.986
Next.

14:22.780 --> 14:23.697
Blu?

14:23.864 --> 14:24.698
Sorry, Bro!

14:24.865 --> 14:28.327
It's okay, Luiz. Good to see you, too.

14:28.994 --> 14:30.704
Listen, Blu,
we are looking for a singer...

14:30.871 --> 14:32.331
a dancer, the whole package.

14:32.498 --> 14:34.667
Yeah, and you're more of
a mumbler-shuffler.

14:34.833 --> 14:36.126
You catch my drift?

14:36.293 --> 14:39.630
No, I'm not here to audition.
I've got news.

14:39.797 --> 14:42.716
I am going to the Amazon.

14:42.883 --> 14:44.301
Yay.

14:45.052 --> 14:48.222
The Amazon? Wow, that's wild.

14:48.389 --> 14:51.016
Yeah, Jewel thinks it'll be good for us.

14:51.183 --> 14:52.184
How wild?

14:52.351 --> 14:53.561
Real wild.

14:53.727 --> 14:56.522
They got mosquitoes
that suck your blood like Slurpees.

14:56.689 --> 14:59.066
Snakes that can swallow you whole.

14:59.233 --> 15:03.696
Flesh-eating piranhas that eat flesh.

15:04.613 --> 15:06.413
Great, that sounds really nice.
I'm not going.

15:06.574 --> 15:07.533
Guys, guys, guys.

15:07.700 --> 15:09.702
Blu, you have nothing to worry about.

15:09.868 --> 15:11.996
All those stories
are highly exaggerated.

15:12.162 --> 15:13.789
- You think so?
- Of course!

15:13.956 --> 15:16.458
If this is important to Jewel,
just do it.

15:16.625 --> 15:19.837
Happy wife, happy life. Remember that.

15:20.004 --> 15:21.964
Okay, yeah, you're right.

15:22.172 --> 15:24.758
A little family vacation
might actually be fun.

15:24.925 --> 15:26.385
Plus, it's not like it's forever.

15:26.552 --> 15:27.636
That's the spirit.

15:27.803 --> 15:29.555
Yeah. Okay.

15:29.722 --> 15:31.015
Thanks, guys.

15:31.432 --> 15:33.183
See you in a couple of weeks!

15:33.350 --> 15:34.768
Safe travels, Blu!

15:34.935 --> 15:36.353
Bring me back a souvenir!

15:36.520 --> 15:41.233
Dawg, he ain't coming back. He is dead.

15:41.442 --> 15:44.069
Amazon!

15:44.236 --> 15:46.155
Let's go! Come on, Dad! Come on!

15:46.322 --> 15:50.618
Okay. Bug spray, check.
Water purifier, check. Band-Aids.

15:50.784 --> 15:52.828
- I feel like I'm forgetting something.
- Cool!

15:52.995 --> 15:55.748
The all-in-one adventurer's knife!

15:55.914 --> 15:57.666
I'll be in charge of this.

15:57.833 --> 15:58.876
That's not for you.

15:59.043 --> 16:00.002
Hey, Dad, look at this.

16:00.169 --> 16:02.921
Did you know the Amazon has snakes
that can swallow you whole?

16:03.088 --> 16:06.258
Actually, Bia,
all those stories are highly exaggerated.

16:06.425 --> 16:07.718
No, really. Look.

16:11.347 --> 16:12.598
That's sick!

16:12.765 --> 16:15.059
All right, are we ready to go?

16:15.225 --> 16:16.435
- A fanny pack?
- Yeah.

16:16.602 --> 16:18.771
Linda gave it to me.
I need it for the GPS.

16:18.937 --> 16:20.164
Where's the GPS?

16:20.189 --> 16:22.066
- Hey!
- Carla, we're leaving.

16:22.316 --> 16:25.194
I'm not going. It's gonna be lame.

16:25.653 --> 16:27.112
Okay, here it is.

16:27.279 --> 16:30.449
The voice recognition makes it
totally foolproof. Here, watch this.

16:31.033 --> 16:32.493
Find Linda and Tulio.

16:32.660 --> 16:35.245
<i>Searching for "Dinner in Tokyo."</i>

16:35.412 --> 16:38.040
Okay. Actually,
that does sound like a nice suggestion.

16:38.207 --> 16:40.125
- You trust this woman?
- Yes, I do.

16:40.292 --> 16:41.752
Hey, wait up, family!

16:42.002 --> 16:43.879
I'm coming, too!

16:44.046 --> 16:45.881
Don't worry, buddy. We got your back.

16:46.048 --> 16:47.049
Eva let you come?

16:47.216 --> 16:49.760
Sure. I promised her a spot
in the Carnival show.

16:49.927 --> 16:51.804
- You did what?
- You guys are late.

16:51.970 --> 16:54.765
- Clock-late.
- But musician-early.

16:54.932 --> 16:56.642
Wait, you guys are coming?

16:56.809 --> 16:57.893
We wouldn't miss it for the world.

16:58.060 --> 17:00.688
We gonna scout the wildest,
coolest talent in the jungle!

17:00.854 --> 17:03.440
It's our inspiration
for this year's Carnival show.

17:03.607 --> 17:06.777
"Amazon Untamed."

17:06.984 --> 17:08.028
Cool!

17:08.194 --> 17:11.656
I mean, yeah. Okay. I guess I'll go.

17:11.824 --> 17:13.450
Amazon jungle or bust, baby!

17:13.617 --> 17:15.786
Who is ready for a tropical adventure?

17:15.953 --> 17:16.787
I know I am!

17:16.954 --> 17:18.664
- All right!
- Let's go, birds!

17:18.830 --> 17:22.041
Wait, we didn't do a head count.
Hey, guys, wait up!

17:22.667 --> 17:24.127
<i>Recalculating.</i>

17:26.505 --> 17:28.882
Hey, birds! Come back!

17:29.383 --> 17:32.302
They left without me. Again!

17:33.137 --> 17:34.888
That's messed up.

18:09.089 --> 18:10.424
<i>Heavy traffic ahead.</i>

18:10.591 --> 18:12.342
Great. Thanks a lot, GPS lady.

18:38.035 --> 18:39.536
Faster, faster, faster!

18:41.497 --> 18:43.207
Slower! Slower! Slower!

18:43.582 --> 18:45.000
Help!

19:09.358 --> 19:13.237
<i>From Rio to Manaus
We are here in paradise</i>

19:13.403 --> 19:15.906
Here we are, kids.
The gateway to the Amazon.

19:19.743 --> 19:21.620
"To be...

19:22.079 --> 19:25.415
or not to be...

19:25.582 --> 19:27.918
that is the question."

19:28.085 --> 19:30.087
"Whether 'tis nobler in the mind...

19:30.254 --> 19:34.758
to suffer the slings and arrows
of outrageous fortune...

19:34.925 --> 19:38.929
or to take arms
against a sea of troubles...

19:39.096 --> 19:42.975
and, by opposing, end them."

19:43.934 --> 19:46.395
That's beautiful, Nigel.

19:46.562 --> 19:47.938
What does it mean?

19:48.105 --> 19:49.606
Death, Gabi.

19:49.773 --> 19:51.942
It's about death.

19:52.609 --> 19:56.572
Nigel, I love it
when you get all dark and brooding.

19:57.739 --> 20:00.284
Hey, bird. It's showtime!

20:00.450 --> 20:02.536
My audience awaits.

20:06.123 --> 20:08.750
From the streets of Rio,
to the Amazon jungle...

20:08.917 --> 20:10.752
the bird of mystery!

20:10.919 --> 20:13.630
Miracle cures! Poison frogs!

20:13.797 --> 20:15.465
- Fire ants!
- Don't be shy!

20:15.632 --> 20:17.634
Learn your destiny!

20:23.807 --> 20:27.477
Hey!
Get away from those! Back to work.

20:30.147 --> 20:33.483
Mommy, Mommy, I want one!
I want a fortune!

20:33.650 --> 20:35.444
Welcome, <i>madame.</i>

20:35.611 --> 20:39.656
This amazing cockatoo
will reveal your future.

20:40.574 --> 20:42.993
All right, bird. Pick a fortune.

20:43.160 --> 20:44.578
Come on, bird.

20:45.120 --> 20:46.496
You're doing great, Nigel.

20:48.165 --> 20:49.291
Pick it already.

20:50.250 --> 20:51.919
Come on, gang. Almost there.

20:52.085 --> 20:54.838
No more flying today.
We've got a boat to catch.

20:56.840 --> 20:59.134
According to my little friend here,
this boat will get us there by morning.

20:59.301 --> 21:00.010
Yeah!

21:05.474 --> 21:08.977
He'll live, but he'll never fly again.

21:11.480 --> 21:14.858
- Come on, bird.
- I want my fortune!

21:15.025 --> 21:16.526
You're doing great, Nigel.

21:16.693 --> 21:18.320
What's taking so long?

21:19.529 --> 21:22.699
What's the matter with you?

21:24.660 --> 21:27.955
That blue bird caused my misery.

21:34.169 --> 21:36.004
Nice birdie?

21:40.050 --> 21:42.370
Why are you hitting yourself?
Why are you hitting yourself?

21:42.386 --> 21:45.347
Wow. Nigel is <i>muy macho.</i>

21:49.309 --> 21:50.560
Thank you.

21:54.231 --> 21:55.565
I'm free!

21:57.067 --> 21:58.735
Poison frog!

22:11.415 --> 22:15.085
The croaking cockatoo
doth bellow for revenge.

22:15.252 --> 22:16.753
That's Shakespeare, by the way.

22:16.920 --> 22:19.506
Without your performance, it's nothing.

22:19.673 --> 22:20.757
Fair point.

22:44.197 --> 22:48.368
This air! It's so fresh and full.

22:48.535 --> 22:51.747
Goodbye, stinky city air!

22:51.913 --> 22:53.957
Yeah, bye.

22:56.793 --> 22:59.796
Hey. Thank you for doing this.

22:59.963 --> 23:01.590
I really appreciate it.

23:01.757 --> 23:04.384
I would do anything for you.
You know that, right?

23:04.551 --> 23:06.636
Of course I do.

23:21.902 --> 23:25.739
We aren't here to snack.
We are here to avenge.

23:25.906 --> 23:28.575
Once these pesky passengers
fall asleep...

23:28.742 --> 23:32.329
we'll show our blue friends some love.
Some...

23:32.662 --> 23:35.082
poisonous love.

23:35.248 --> 23:37.334
That's my specialty.

23:37.501 --> 23:39.836
We attack at the midnight hour...

23:40.003 --> 23:42.172
because it's more evil.

23:42.339 --> 23:44.174
Stay alert.

23:49.846 --> 23:52.766
Midnight! Time to attack.

23:53.475 --> 23:56.019
Nigel! Nigel?

23:58.522 --> 24:01.441
Look at us. Misfits.

24:02.192 --> 24:06.446
A toxic frog, and a flightless freak.

24:06.696 --> 24:10.992
So different, and yet, the same.

24:11.326 --> 24:13.161
<i>My darling, while you sleep
All is well</i>

24:13.328 --> 24:17.499
<i>We are friends, and that's swell
But the truth is that I have a secret to tell</i>

24:17.666 --> 24:21.461
<i>I love you</i>

24:24.172 --> 24:25.674
<i>People say it's wrong
It's absurd</i>

24:25.841 --> 24:28.677
<i>That a frog and a bird are in love
But I know in my heart</i>

24:28.844 --> 24:33.223
<i>This was so meant to be</i>

24:34.015 --> 24:36.977
<i>If only we could hug and could kiss
It'd be heavenly bliss</i>

24:37.144 --> 24:39.496
<i>But your lungs would explode
And you'd look just like this</i>

24:39.521 --> 24:42.190
<i>And you'd gag
With your face turning blue</i>

24:42.357 --> 24:43.692
<i>Eww</i>

24:44.025 --> 24:46.903
<i>But, darling, I'll protect you
I will, don't worry, just chill</i>

24:47.070 --> 24:49.865
<i>'Cause there isn't a bird
That I wouldn't kill</i>

24:50.031 --> 24:54.995
<i>For you
Can't you see</i>

24:56.413 --> 24:59.082
<i>We were destined to be?</i>

24:59.249 --> 25:03.753
<i>- For we have love
- Love</i>

25:03.920 --> 25:07.215
<i>- Poisonous love
- Love</i>

25:07.382 --> 25:11.052
<i>And although, yes</i>

25:11.261 --> 25:16.558
<i>I know that you can't hold me</i>

25:16.725 --> 25:18.685
Feel me close now.

25:18.852 --> 25:23.773
<i>Your loving wings enfold me</i>

25:24.399 --> 25:27.027
<i>Fate told me</i>

25:27.194 --> 25:28.778
<i>Love</i>

25:28.945 --> 25:31.281
<i>- Poisonous love
- Love</i>

25:32.157 --> 25:34.784
<i>Standing here</i>

25:34.951 --> 25:38.413
<i>You're so near
And yet</i>

25:39.414 --> 25:40.999
<i>So far</i>

25:41.249 --> 25:42.751
<i>Like a star.</i>

25:42.918 --> 25:44.920
<i>Here we are</i>

25:45.086 --> 25:46.796
<i>Where?</i>

25:46.963 --> 25:49.507
<i>What to do?</i>

25:49.674 --> 25:52.260
<i>To do</i>

25:52.636 --> 25:54.471
Oh, pooh.

25:55.513 --> 25:59.309
<i>You're my Romeo
I'm Juliet</i>

25:59.476 --> 26:01.645
<i>We're so perfect, and yet</i>

26:01.811 --> 26:03.980
<i>If we touch, not by much</i>

26:04.147 --> 26:06.149
<i>Still on all you can bet</i>

26:06.316 --> 26:09.152
<i>It's goodbye</i>

26:09.319 --> 26:12.989
<i>And I'll cry</i>

26:13.949 --> 26:18.870
<i>As you die</i>

26:19.162 --> 26:25.001
<i>From our poisonous love</i>

26:38.682 --> 26:40.517
What a nightmare.

26:41.476 --> 26:42.352
Charlie!

26:42.644 --> 26:45.188
You were supposed to wake me!

26:45.522 --> 26:47.524
It's time.

26:55.865 --> 26:58.410
I love being on Team Nigel!

28:03.266 --> 28:08.480
I can't think of anything more romantic than
poisoning passengers on a moonlight cruise.

28:08.646 --> 28:09.481
Stop.

28:10.899 --> 28:13.068
That one is mine.

28:13.234 --> 28:15.445
Twinkle, twinkle little Blu.

28:15.612 --> 28:18.114
How I wondered, where were you?

28:18.281 --> 28:21.159
Up above the world so high...

28:21.326 --> 28:23.286
are you ready...

28:23.453 --> 28:25.580
to die?

28:25.747 --> 28:27.415
You need a breath mint.

28:27.582 --> 28:30.335
Even in sleep, you mock me.

28:46.810 --> 28:48.436
Wait for me!

28:49.270 --> 28:51.106
Don't leave me!

28:51.856 --> 28:53.650
Tiago! Stop fooling around.

28:53.817 --> 28:55.276
I didn't do anything.

28:55.443 --> 28:57.195
Tiago Gunderson, listen to your mother.

28:57.362 --> 28:59.322
Man.

29:00.323 --> 29:02.158
We're almost there, right?

29:02.325 --> 29:03.868
- Hey, guys. Wait up.
- Come on, Blu.

29:04.035 --> 29:05.537
Remember, birds of a...

29:06.204 --> 29:07.831
Nevermind.

29:11.501 --> 29:12.877
They're getting away!

29:13.169 --> 29:16.339
Wake up, you insect-eating idiot.
Follow them.

29:18.508 --> 29:21.177
Better. Now go ten times faster.

29:23.304 --> 29:25.014
River hogs!

30:04.762 --> 30:05.722
You!

30:05.889 --> 30:09.225
I always suspected
you were dumber than a monkey.

30:09.392 --> 30:10.935
And now, I know.

30:11.728 --> 30:14.272
Boss! What are you doing in the jungle?

30:14.439 --> 30:16.232
Perhaps the better question is...

30:16.608 --> 30:17.984
what are they doing?

30:18.735 --> 30:20.487
Nature freaks.

30:23.114 --> 30:25.492
Two million square miles of jungle...

30:25.742 --> 30:28.912
and they're playing in my backyard?

30:30.079 --> 30:31.956
I don't think so.

30:32.123 --> 30:35.960
As you know, my friends,
this logging operation is a little...

30:36.753 --> 30:37.921
illegal.

30:38.087 --> 30:41.758
If those two nuts find those birds,
we're out of business.

30:41.925 --> 30:42.926
And that's why you...

30:43.343 --> 30:47.138
must put an end to their
little bird-watching expedition.

30:47.305 --> 30:50.683
Find them and get rid of them.

30:50.850 --> 30:53.853
The rest of you, go out some trees.

30:56.105 --> 30:58.983
Who cares about a bunch of birds?

30:59.859 --> 31:03.029
The macaws should
be nesting near the Brazil nut trees.

31:03.196 --> 31:05.281
So, I think
that we should continue with go...

31:06.032 --> 31:09.160
Tulio! Are you listening to me?

31:09.536 --> 31:11.538
<i>You have reached your destination.</i>

31:11.704 --> 31:14.874
You see? It works like a charm.
Here we are.

31:16.543 --> 31:17.627
Where?

31:17.961 --> 31:19.629
These things have a margin of error.

31:19.796 --> 31:22.131
I told you not to trust that woman.

31:23.049 --> 31:26.803
That's a <i>Heliconious</i> larva.
It's about to enter the pupa stage.

31:26.970 --> 31:28.638
You said "poop!"

31:28.805 --> 31:30.723
Hey, kids. Stay close.

31:31.140 --> 31:32.141
I'll get them.

31:32.308 --> 31:35.645
Okay, you guys stay put.
I'll look around.

31:35.812 --> 31:39.315
No worries. We'll be here.
We're not going anywhere.

31:39.482 --> 31:41.484
My feathers is popping up
on the back of my neck.

31:41.651 --> 31:42.986
I don't like this.

31:43.486 --> 31:44.821
Let's back it up.

31:47.824 --> 31:49.993
Bia? Tiago?

31:53.746 --> 31:54.914
Come on, lady.

31:55.832 --> 31:58.751
- Don't let me down.
<i>- Calculating route to ”Funky Town."</i>

31:58.918 --> 31:59.752
Oh, great.

32:07.176 --> 32:08.678
Okay, guys!

32:10.555 --> 32:12.223
Guys?

32:14.726 --> 32:17.020
Good one, guys. Very funny.

32:17.186 --> 32:19.063
Good, good. Very witty.

32:19.772 --> 32:21.899
Jewel, where are you?

32:22.358 --> 32:24.944
Kids? Jewel?

32:27.572 --> 32:28.698
It's a Macaw!

32:28.865 --> 32:30.033
Linda!

32:30.199 --> 32:31.367
Let me go!

32:33.953 --> 32:35.371
Let me go, you heathens!

32:35.872 --> 32:36.706
Blu?

32:41.419 --> 32:43.713
I swear that sounded like Blu.

32:43.880 --> 32:45.381
That's impossible, Linda.

32:45.548 --> 32:48.217
He's back home in Rio, safe and sound.

32:48.384 --> 32:50.094
I am an American citizen, you savage!

32:50.261 --> 32:51.763
I demand to see my ambassador!

32:51.929 --> 32:53.723
I know my rights! I know my rights!

32:56.225 --> 32:58.227
Back. Back, you barbarian!

32:58.895 --> 32:59.729
Yeah, that's right.

33:00.271 --> 33:02.106
It's a spoon and a fork.

33:02.273 --> 33:04.734
Be afraid! Be very afraid.

33:04.901 --> 33:08.655
Whoa! Whoa, buddy. Put the spork down.

33:08.905 --> 33:09.947
- Let me go!
- Bring it!

33:10.114 --> 33:12.075
Come on! You lucky I ain't big.

33:41.020 --> 33:43.523
I can't believe we found them!

33:43.690 --> 33:46.234
Technically, they found us.

33:46.734 --> 33:48.861
Okay, we're gonna need some nametags.

33:49.028 --> 33:51.489
Hello. Okay.

33:51.698 --> 33:53.991
No, those are breath mints.
Not that you need one.

33:54.158 --> 33:56.202
But they're good. You eat them.

33:57.078 --> 33:58.871
No, no, no! Not the whole box.

33:59.038 --> 34:00.748
Get that out of your mouth!

34:04.168 --> 34:07.046
What is this doing here?
What's going on?

34:07.213 --> 34:09.132
We found them flying too close
to the humans.

34:09.297 --> 34:11.050
- What? And who are you?
- Uh...

34:11.217 --> 34:12.969
"Uh" is not an appropriate answer.

34:13.136 --> 34:15.304
I asked you a question.
Where did you come from?

34:15.471 --> 34:16.431
Hey! Back off!

34:16.597 --> 34:18.599
Hey, excuse me, young lady.

34:20.893 --> 34:23.062
I can't believe it.

34:23.938 --> 34:25.606
How is this...?

34:25.773 --> 34:27.567
When the loggers came...

34:27.734 --> 34:32.029
there was fire, and so much smoke.

34:32.237 --> 34:35.324
I had you under my wing,
and then you were...

34:35.491 --> 34:36.284
Gone.

34:36.451 --> 34:38.244
I've looked everywhere for you.

34:38.411 --> 34:40.455
I'm here.

34:40.621 --> 34:42.039
Daddy!

34:43.206 --> 34:44.542
"Daddy"?

34:47.128 --> 34:49.088
I missed you.

34:50.339 --> 34:52.592
It's okay. It's okay, now.

34:52.759 --> 34:55.136
Daddy has you.

34:57.889 --> 34:59.348
Look at you.

34:59.515 --> 35:03.019
It's my little girl, all grown up.

35:03.978 --> 35:05.563
You're so beautiful.

35:06.981 --> 35:08.900
Just like your mother.

35:11.319 --> 35:13.070
I'm so sorry I lost you.

35:13.696 --> 35:17.200
I can't imagine you alone,
all this time.

35:17.366 --> 35:20.995
No, it's okay, Dad. I wasn't alone.

35:22.079 --> 35:23.289
Blu found me.

35:26.834 --> 35:28.961
Sure is nice to meet you, sir.

35:30.505 --> 35:32.256
Tuck that wing away, Stu.

35:32.882 --> 35:35.009
- Now, come here.
- Right, sure. Okay.

35:35.343 --> 35:36.928
- Closer.
- Really?

35:37.094 --> 35:38.221
Closer.

35:39.013 --> 35:42.475
You brought my Jewel back to me.
I thank you.

35:43.100 --> 35:45.812
- I'm gonna hug you now.
- Okay.

35:47.355 --> 35:49.565
- Now, come here, you.
- Okay. There we are.

35:49.732 --> 35:50.817
My pleasure.

35:50.983 --> 35:52.652
Nico. You crying?

35:52.819 --> 35:55.279
It's a heavy moment,
and I'm very vulnerable right now.

35:55.446 --> 35:57.281
Come here. Let me get you a hug.

36:02.161 --> 36:03.955
Mom, are you okay?

36:04.121 --> 36:05.206
"Mom"?

36:05.373 --> 36:08.334
I'm a grandpa? I'm a grandpa.

36:08.501 --> 36:10.002
Look at me, I'm a grandpa!

36:10.169 --> 36:13.256
Daddy, this is Carla, Bia and Tiago.

36:13.422 --> 36:14.632
Nice to meet you, sir.

36:14.799 --> 36:16.801
There is no "sir" around here,
young lady.

36:16.968 --> 36:19.136
- You will call me "Pop-Pop!"
- Pop-Pop.

36:19.303 --> 36:21.639
I like that. It's got a nice ring to it.

36:21.806 --> 36:25.017
I am a Pop-Pop!
Yeah, I'm the Pop-Pop-Pop.

36:25.184 --> 36:28.271
Kids, go easy on old Pop-Pop.

36:28.437 --> 36:29.939
You can call me "sir."

36:30.773 --> 36:33.317
My daughter has returned!

36:38.698 --> 36:40.575
For years, we have been on the run...

36:40.741 --> 36:42.785
as the humans push us
deeper into the jungle.

36:42.952 --> 36:46.122
But as you can see,
we have found sanctuary.

36:46.289 --> 36:49.041
A place we can finally put down roots.

36:49.208 --> 36:53.296
Everyone! Come on!
Everyone, out of your nests!

36:55.214 --> 36:57.466
My daughter is home!

36:57.633 --> 37:00.928
Come on, birds. My Jewel is back!

37:03.848 --> 37:05.433
Jewel?

37:05.975 --> 37:08.603
Make way. Make way! Jewel!

37:08.769 --> 37:10.104
Aunt Mimi? Aunt Mimi!

37:12.982 --> 37:14.483
I missed you so much!

37:14.650 --> 37:17.570
My little wildflower has returned!

37:17.862 --> 37:21.866
I knew you were coming back.
I saw it in the droppings.

37:22.825 --> 37:24.619
And look at the little ones!

37:26.579 --> 37:29.582
Aren't you the fluffiest,
most delicious little macaws?

37:30.499 --> 37:32.835
- You're big for your age.
- Mimi...

37:33.002 --> 37:33.920
this is Sue.

37:34.086 --> 37:37.089
- Actually, I'm Blu.
- Aren't we all?

37:37.256 --> 37:38.841
No, really, that's my name.

37:39.091 --> 37:40.760
That's why they call us "Blue Macaws."

37:41.093 --> 37:42.053
Just go with it.

37:48.684 --> 37:51.354
So, that's what a Blue Macaw
is supposed to look like?

37:56.859 --> 37:57.068
<i><font color="#ff8000">Look</font> at her shining</i>

<i><font color="#ff8000">back</font></i>

38:38.943 --> 38:40.111
Wow, you look great!

38:40.277 --> 38:42.071
So do you.

38:42.238 --> 38:45.992
Hi, hey. Hi, there.
I am Jewel's significant other.

38:46.909 --> 38:50.246
So, you're the lucky bird
who swept Ju-Ju off her feet.

38:50.454 --> 38:52.081
- "Ju-Ju"?
- Yeah.

38:52.248 --> 38:54.792
When we were kids, we always had
the cutest nicknames for each other.

38:54.959 --> 38:57.253
We did. I called him "Beto."

38:57.420 --> 38:59.296
That's adorable.
I love doing the nicknames.

38:59.463 --> 39:01.298
You never mentioned any "Roberto."

39:01.465 --> 39:02.675
There's nothing to mention.

39:02.842 --> 39:03.926
Hey.

39:04.093 --> 39:05.261
There's my wingman!

39:05.428 --> 39:07.388
We can rest easy
with Roberto on the lookout.

39:07.555 --> 39:10.433
Eduardo taught me everything I know.
He's the bird.

39:10.599 --> 39:12.226
No. You're the bird.

39:12.393 --> 39:14.061
- No, you're the bird.
- You're the bird!

39:14.228 --> 39:16.063
We get it. You're both "the bird."

39:16.230 --> 39:18.733
Now, can we stop yakking
and start partying?

39:20.901 --> 39:22.945
Wow! I remember this song.

39:23.154 --> 39:25.781
How could you forget?
It's in our blood, baby.

39:25.948 --> 39:28.451
It's who we are.

39:28.617 --> 39:30.286
You don't mind
if I borrow her for a minute, do you?

39:30.453 --> 39:31.996
- Actually...
- Come on, Ju-Ju!

39:32.163 --> 39:34.290
Let's go!

39:34.582 --> 39:35.041

You're the only one who knows

Misunderstood.

41:37.746 --> 41:40.166
You're the evil to my lethal.

41:40.332 --> 41:42.585
I can see why they call you "Gabi."

41:42.751 --> 41:45.754
Where are you, you filthy fowl?

41:47.840 --> 41:48.841
Halt!

41:55.014 --> 41:56.891
I've been going about this all wrong.

41:57.057 --> 41:59.602
I need to search from higher ground.

42:03.522 --> 42:06.525
You stayed airborne
for almost a full second that time.

42:09.612 --> 42:12.448
What are you looking at?
Get me up there.

42:13.616 --> 42:14.950
Higher.

42:15.201 --> 42:17.620
Higher! Even higher.

42:18.454 --> 42:20.039
Little bit higher.

42:21.373 --> 42:22.958
Lower. Lower, now.

42:23.709 --> 42:26.879
Yes. Perfect.

42:29.423 --> 42:32.092
It's an infestation.

42:33.552 --> 42:37.932
Keep celebrating.
I'll be pooping on your party promptly.

42:41.894 --> 42:44.396
Hi, Nico! Hi, Pedro!

42:46.106 --> 42:47.316
We came to the right place.

42:47.483 --> 42:49.652
This is popping.
It's popping in the Amazon.

42:49.818 --> 42:51.528
We could bring these macaws
back to Rio...

42:51.695 --> 42:54.531
and have the best Carnival show ever.

42:54.698 --> 42:57.493
I am inspired!

42:59.495 --> 43:01.830
Sorry to break it to you, city boys...

43:01.997 --> 43:03.666
but you'll have to find
some other talent.

43:03.832 --> 43:05.668
Nobody leaves the tribe.

43:07.127 --> 43:10.172
And no human things in the jungle.
Understood?

43:11.298 --> 43:13.300
What? What's his problem?

43:13.467 --> 43:15.010
I feel naked.

43:16.679 --> 43:18.472
We could have been legends.

43:18.639 --> 43:21.058
We already are super-mega-dope, but...

43:21.225 --> 43:22.309
You know what I'm saying?

43:22.685 --> 43:24.895
We had it all.
The undiscovered talent...

43:25.062 --> 43:27.039
the big idea, the inspiration.

43:27.064 --> 43:29.692
But if we can't bring
these guys to Rio...

43:29.858 --> 43:30.818
we got nothing.

43:30.985 --> 43:31.902
Nothing?

43:32.861 --> 43:35.906
Hold your mangoes. We still have Eva.

43:37.658 --> 43:38.742
What?

43:43.163 --> 43:46.041
Wow! You still got the moves, Ju-Ju.

43:46.375 --> 43:47.710
- I'm so exhausted.
- Yeah.

43:47.876 --> 43:51.171
We should get some rest.
Find a local inn, or B and B nearby.

43:51.338 --> 43:52.548
What is this crazy talk?

43:52.715 --> 43:54.717
No, you guys are staying in my nest.

43:54.883 --> 43:56.218
I'm on patrol tonight.

43:56.385 --> 43:58.178
<i>Mí casa es su casa.</i>

43:58.345 --> 43:59.722
That's really nice, Beto.

43:59.888 --> 44:01.223
Thank you, but we're fine.

44:01.390 --> 44:04.893
Besides, our whole family
couldn't possibly fit in your bachelor pad.

44:05.269 --> 44:06.562
Whoa.

44:07.688 --> 44:09.481
Real estate must be pretty cheap
around here.

44:09.648 --> 44:11.942
Wow. This is incredible.

44:12.735 --> 44:16.280
This old nest? It's just something
I put together last minute.

44:16.447 --> 44:18.741
With my own two wings, of course.

44:18.907 --> 44:20.451
And my strength.

44:20.617 --> 44:22.077
And my brawn.

44:23.829 --> 44:26.498
Dad, it's huge! It has six bedrooms!

44:26.790 --> 44:29.418
- I get the big one!
- No! I'm the oldest.

44:29.585 --> 44:32.087
Only by 3 minutes, 2.5 seconds.

44:32.921 --> 44:34.361
I had hoped to one day be blessed...

44:34.465 --> 44:36.633
with a flock of little Robertos
to call my own.

44:36.800 --> 44:38.677
- I bet you did.
- No way!

44:38.844 --> 44:40.512
A bird bath!

44:41.472 --> 44:42.139
Tiago, caref...

44:45.642 --> 44:47.436
Jacuzzi.

44:49.688 --> 44:51.857
Blu, let me tell you something.

44:52.024 --> 44:56.612
If anything, and I mean anything,
ever happens to you...

44:56.779 --> 44:58.697
I will take care of your family.

44:59.323 --> 45:01.116
All right, buddy. Sleep well.

45:01.283 --> 45:03.952
- Good night, Ju-Ju.
- Good night.

45:18.133 --> 45:19.760
Okay. All clear.

45:20.135 --> 45:20.635

<i><font color="#ff8000">Stay another day</font></i>

45:50.916 --> 45:53.252
Can you sing it again, please?

45:54.211 --> 45:56.505
Time for bed, now.

46:02.261 --> 46:04.972
What an amazing day.

46:05.139 --> 46:07.558
All this time...

46:07.724 --> 46:12.438
I never let myself hope
that they were alive.

46:13.647 --> 46:15.107
But they are.

46:16.608 --> 46:19.236
We found our family, Blu.

46:20.946 --> 46:23.657
This changes everything.

46:23.824 --> 46:25.200
Yeah.

46:25.367 --> 46:28.704
Wait. What? What's changing?

46:30.789 --> 46:32.332
Jewel?

47:07.951 --> 47:10.287
Shoo, shoo, shoo. Go on.

47:36.396 --> 47:39.483
Honey, stop. That tickles.

47:45.739 --> 47:47.157
That was fun!

47:49.368 --> 47:50.536
Tiago!

47:51.411 --> 47:53.080
Come on, Tiago. Let's go.

48:03.173 --> 48:04.383
Morning.

48:04.550 --> 48:06.927
Or should I say "afternoon"?

48:09.346 --> 48:10.305
Morning, sir.

48:10.472 --> 48:12.891
Our days here in the jungle,
they start early.

48:13.100 --> 48:14.351
Morning, Daddy.

48:14.518 --> 48:17.145
That's my girl. See?
Already up and at 'em.

48:17.312 --> 48:18.355
Morning, sweetie.

48:19.356 --> 48:20.732
Why did you let me sleep in?

48:20.899 --> 48:23.277
What are you talking about?
You sleep in every day.

48:23.443 --> 48:24.861
- Yeah, but...
- Hey, Dad.

48:25.028 --> 48:27.030
Aunt Mimi says
clay is good for your digestion.

48:27.197 --> 48:29.049
- Try some.
- No, sweetie. I just brushed my...

48:29.074 --> 48:31.451
It's good, right?
I'm gonna go get some more.

48:31.868 --> 48:33.203
Smart girl.

48:36.290 --> 48:39.543
So, I thought I'd take Louie, here,
for a little tour of the area.

48:39.710 --> 48:40.877
Show him around.

48:41.044 --> 48:42.462
- That's a great idea.
- What?

48:42.629 --> 48:46.008
You go have fun with Daddy,
and I'll explore around here with the kids.

48:47.050 --> 48:48.635
- Yeah, okay. Sure.
- You'll love it.

48:48.802 --> 48:51.096
Yeah, great. I just gotta...

48:56.727 --> 48:58.061
Okay, ready.

49:01.523 --> 49:02.816
Okay.

49:03.317 --> 49:05.277
Lou, come closer.

49:09.823 --> 49:11.658
- Not so close.
- Okay.

49:11.825 --> 49:13.327
Listen...

49:13.493 --> 49:16.663
I can barely look at it.
You gotta lose that human pocket, okay?

49:16.913 --> 49:18.373
This is a fanny pack.

49:18.540 --> 49:21.001
"Fanny pack." Adorable.

49:21.168 --> 49:22.377
It's human.

49:22.544 --> 49:26.048
And now that you're joining the tribe,
you won't be needing it anymore.

49:26.214 --> 49:28.550
I'll meet you by the clay banks.

49:29.092 --> 49:30.177
"Joining the tribe"?

49:30.344 --> 49:32.784
He doesn't actually think
we're moving to the jungle, does he?

49:32.888 --> 49:36.183
No. He's just excited we're all here.

49:36.350 --> 49:38.018
Let's not ruin the moment, okay?

49:38.185 --> 49:42.105
Besides, it won't kill you
to leave behind the fanny pack.

49:42.272 --> 49:46.026
All right, you win.
I will leave the fanny pack behind.

49:47.611 --> 49:49.237
Happy wife, happy li...

49:49.404 --> 49:50.238
Bye, honey.

49:50.614 --> 49:51.823
Have fun.

49:52.074 --> 49:55.410
Yeah. Sure. Bye.

50:05.837 --> 50:09.174
You guys. Wakey-wakey!

50:09.341 --> 50:11.968
- Wake up!
- Eva! You got it!

50:12.135 --> 50:14.680
What happened to "Amazon Untamed"?

50:14.846 --> 50:16.765
Here's the plan. Auditions today...

50:16.932 --> 50:19.017
and we preview the show tomorrow.

50:19.184 --> 50:21.603
"We"? What you talking about, "we"?
You speak French?

50:21.770 --> 50:24.981
Come on, chop-chop. Let's get started!

50:27.025 --> 50:28.235
Kid's been working.

50:30.362 --> 50:32.406
<i>Tell me when to go
Tell me when to go</i>

50:32.572 --> 50:34.241
<i>Tell me when to go
Tell me when to go!</i>

50:37.077 --> 50:39.955
<i>'Cause shawty got low, low, low, low, low</i>

50:42.207 --> 50:43.709
Any time you're ready.

50:44.584 --> 50:45.669
<i>Every time I come a fella gotta get it</i>

50:45.836 --> 50:47.462
<i>Then I gotta go, and then I gotta get it
Then they gotta blow</i>

50:47.629 --> 50:49.631
<i>And then I gotta show that any little thing
A fella think that he be doing</i>

50:49.798 --> 50:51.341
<i>'Cause it doesn't matter, I'm done</i>

50:58.140 --> 50:58.807
Next!

50:59.015 --> 51:02.310
We are the amazing Capoeira Turtles.

51:11.903 --> 51:13.223
- Bravo! Encore! Encore!
- Encore!

51:13.905 --> 51:15.949
Sorry, guys. Did I miss anything?

51:16.199 --> 51:17.701
Mosquito.

51:35.343 --> 51:37.554
Hi, my name is Claira the capybara...

51:37.721 --> 51:40.390
and I will be singing my favorite song.

51:42.100 --> 51:44.394
<i>Memory</i>

51:44.561 --> 51:48.356
<i>All alone in the moonlight</i>

51:54.571 --> 51:56.740
<i>Touch me</i>

51:56.907 --> 52:00.702
<i>It's so easy to leave me</i>

52:00.952 --> 52:02.913
If they keep eating each other,
we got no show.

52:03.079 --> 52:05.123
This ain't an
all-you-can-eat competition!

52:12.756 --> 52:16.092
Hey. You are fast.
You are really, really fast.

52:16.259 --> 52:19.179
I think I pulled a wing or something.
You are really fast for an old bird.

52:19.346 --> 52:23.183
For such a wise bird,
is what I meant to say. Wise bird.

52:23.350 --> 52:24.935
Which sometimes comes with age...

52:25.101 --> 52:26.812
but also can happen when you're young,
like in your case.

52:26.978 --> 52:29.231
You could be wise and young,
which is kind of a rare combination...

52:29.397 --> 52:30.665
but thrilling when it happens.

52:30.690 --> 52:32.108
- Be quiet.
- Thank you, sir.

52:32.275 --> 52:33.875
It's time to shake that city off of you.

52:33.985 --> 52:36.571
You need to learn
the basics of jungle survival.

52:36.738 --> 52:38.240
I thought we were going sightseeing.

52:39.324 --> 52:41.159
It's training day.

52:42.327 --> 52:44.454
Come on! The mud is your friend.

52:44.621 --> 52:47.499
This is your camouflage!
Feel it. Taste it!

52:47.666 --> 52:50.418
If you don't feel crusty,
you're not doing it right!

52:51.670 --> 52:53.964
You don't wanna be seen by humans!

52:54.130 --> 52:56.842
Come on!
Are you a macaw or a turkey?

53:03.598 --> 53:05.308
Faster. Faster.

53:05.600 --> 53:08.436
Come on!
You don't wanna be eaten!

53:10.522 --> 53:13.984
You're alone in the jungle.
You get caught in a trap.

53:14.150 --> 53:15.777
What do you do?

53:15.944 --> 53:17.153
If I had my fanny pack...

53:17.320 --> 53:18.822
No! You use your beak.

53:18.989 --> 53:20.669
- My beak.
- It's your most important tool.

53:20.782 --> 53:22.826
Okay, okay. No, I use my beak.

53:23.451 --> 53:25.495
- Almost.
- Time's up!

53:25.662 --> 53:27.289
You're jaguar meat.

53:27.455 --> 53:29.207
Roberto got it on the first try.

53:29.833 --> 53:31.126
Of course he did.

53:31.501 --> 53:34.629
Up, up! And hover!

53:34.796 --> 53:36.464
- Now, backwards!
- What, backwards?

53:36.631 --> 53:38.508
No, only hummingbirds can fly backwards.

53:38.675 --> 53:40.218
Backwards.

53:40.552 --> 53:42.345
Over! Under! Over!

53:42.679 --> 53:44.639
Under! Over!

53:44.806 --> 53:46.474
- Good job.
- Thanks.

53:46.641 --> 53:47.851
Not you.

53:48.852 --> 53:49.978
Hi.

53:51.605 --> 53:53.148
Brazil nut trees.

53:53.648 --> 53:58.028
These trees are the key
to our way of life.

53:58.820 --> 54:01.072
The trees feed us.

54:01.656 --> 54:03.491
They sustain us.

54:07.829 --> 54:09.915
- Wake up!
- I'm up.

54:10.081 --> 54:12.000
Nutty Brazil...
Brazil nut trees, something.

54:12.167 --> 54:13.335
Yeah, got it.

54:13.501 --> 54:16.630
This is important.
We have to protect these trees.

54:16.796 --> 54:18.673
Our future depends on it.

54:18.840 --> 54:19.841
Yo, Eddie.

54:20.175 --> 54:21.343
Who is your sidekick?

54:21.509 --> 54:23.219
You got a nurse now?

54:24.179 --> 54:24.846
Hi, I'm...

54:25.013 --> 54:27.682
Aren't you boys getting
a little bit too close to our side?

54:27.849 --> 54:29.059
We have a deal, Felipe.

54:29.225 --> 54:30.727
Hey, relax.

54:30.894 --> 54:33.063
You know we got nothing
but mad love for you.

54:33.229 --> 54:34.981
Come on, boys, let's fly.

54:35.148 --> 54:39.069
Paint the sky. Before they start to cry.

54:39.527 --> 54:41.727
- They seem nice.
- They have their side of the grove...

54:41.863 --> 54:42.989
and we have ours.

54:43.198 --> 54:45.241
Food is scarce these days.

54:55.877 --> 54:58.171
Never seen them
this close to the village before.

54:58.338 --> 54:59.089
What?

54:59.255 --> 55:01.925
- Don't let them see you!
- Right, right. Sorry.

55:02.717 --> 55:04.386
Maybe we should go find Linda.

55:04.552 --> 55:07.681
- What's a Linda?
- Linda is the person that raised me.

55:07.847 --> 55:09.557
What? You're a pet?

55:09.724 --> 55:13.228
No, it wasn't anything like that.
I was a companion.

55:13.395 --> 55:16.189
You liked it?
That explains everything.

55:16.356 --> 55:18.525
- Linda is family.
- Family?

55:18.733 --> 55:20.735
Humans aren't family.

55:20.902 --> 55:22.570
No, you don't understand.
They're coming here to help.

55:22.737 --> 55:23.530
Listen to me.

55:23.697 --> 55:26.408
We do not bring humans into the tribe.

55:26.574 --> 55:28.618
That is the only reason
we're still alive.

55:28.785 --> 55:31.913
You cannot be confused about this.
Understood?

55:32.247 --> 55:33.790
Yeah. Got it.

55:34.582 --> 55:36.960
Sightseeing is over.

55:42.757 --> 55:44.426
Do you see the nest?

55:48.179 --> 55:49.723
Tulio, are you okay?

55:50.056 --> 55:52.434
I'm fine! I'm okay!

55:56.271 --> 55:57.689
Not okay.

56:02.110 --> 56:04.446
Tulio, they're cutting down the forest!

56:04.612 --> 56:06.281
Linda, where are you going?

56:06.448 --> 56:09.534
To talk to them.
You talk to birds, I talk to humans.

56:09.701 --> 56:11.286
No! Wait, don't!

56:12.787 --> 56:14.956
Hey! Hey, mister!

56:15.123 --> 56:16.875
Hello!

56:17.042 --> 56:19.210
You take it easy with that chainsaw.

56:19.919 --> 56:24.799
There are rare birds living around here.
You can't cut down these trees!

56:25.133 --> 56:27.761
Sweetheart! There you are.

56:28.094 --> 56:29.387
I was looking for you.

56:29.554 --> 56:32.474
Hi, there. Beautiful out here, isn't it?

56:33.475 --> 56:34.601
You two lost?

56:36.269 --> 56:37.937
Lost? No!

56:38.980 --> 56:39.773
Lost?

56:40.398 --> 56:41.483
No.

56:41.649 --> 56:44.319
We're here on our honeymoon.

56:44.486 --> 56:46.988
We're actually just heading back
to join the tour.

56:47.155 --> 56:49.491
It's karaoke night.

56:49.991 --> 56:53.328
Come along, honey.
<i>Moon River</i> isn't going to sing itself.

56:53.661 --> 56:57.082
Linda, logs aren't the only things
these guys out.

56:58.750 --> 57:00.502
Run, Linda. I'll hold them off.

57:00.668 --> 57:03.671
- Go, go, go! Run!
- Okay, okay, okay!

57:09.427 --> 57:10.595
Excuse me, excuse me!

57:15.975 --> 57:16.976
Come on, I'll race you.

57:17.936 --> 57:20.730
- This is great!
- All right, Tiago!

57:20.897 --> 57:21.689
Oh, yeah!

57:22.065 --> 57:23.691
Tiago!

57:24.943 --> 57:25.777
Hey!

57:30.865 --> 57:32.242
That is so good.

57:32.408 --> 57:33.868
Hey, you're back.

57:34.828 --> 57:36.704
How did it go?

57:37.872 --> 57:41.543
We had a great time.
It was educational.

57:41.709 --> 57:44.671
Dad! Uncle Beto showed me
some cool flying tricks.

57:44.838 --> 57:45.755
"Uncle"?

57:45.922 --> 57:48.133
Look, I can fly backwards.

57:48.299 --> 57:50.218
Yeah, you're a natural, T-Bird.

57:53.346 --> 57:56.057
It's never too soon
to learn the ways of the jungle, Tiago.

57:57.058 --> 57:59.144
Although, some may never learn.

58:00.937 --> 58:03.273
I'm gonna go clean up.

58:05.191 --> 58:08.194
Roberto, we saw humans near the grove.

58:08.361 --> 58:10.613
I need you to stay alert.

58:11.990 --> 58:13.074
"Ways of the jungle."

58:13.241 --> 58:15.743
I would like to learn a way
out of this jungle.

58:21.916 --> 58:24.794
There he is. Now is our chance.

58:24.961 --> 58:26.171
I'm so excited!

58:26.337 --> 58:28.006
Prepare the tongue-a-pult.

58:32.218 --> 58:35.388
Charlie, make me fly again.

58:36.472 --> 58:37.932
Go get them, tiger!

58:43.188 --> 58:45.190
Bow before the conquering cockatoo.

58:45.732 --> 58:47.442
What is your problem, dude?

58:47.984 --> 58:49.903
Bird, that was sick!

58:50.069 --> 58:52.238
Now, that's the energy
you bring into an audition.

58:52.614 --> 58:53.489
Audition?

58:53.656 --> 58:55.825
Yeah, that's actually why I'm here.

58:55.992 --> 58:57.452
I've got a great little...

58:58.661 --> 58:59.329
Go on.

58:59.495 --> 59:01.664
We're looking for a new star.

59:02.040 --> 59:03.249
Star?

59:03.416 --> 59:06.544
You look familiar.
Don't I know you from somewhere?

59:06.878 --> 59:10.089
No, I don't think so. No. I'm...

59:10.924 --> 59:14.928
Bob. Yes. Bob, the bird.

59:16.137 --> 59:18.389
Okay, Bob, whatever.
Show us what you got.

59:21.851 --> 59:22.143

01:02:40.842 --> 01:02:43.761
No, no. Hang on.
I just found Linda and Tulio's coordinates.

01:02:43.928 --> 01:02:45.346
They are just
on the other side of the grove.

01:02:45.513 --> 01:02:46.848
Look, they're really close.

01:02:47.557 --> 01:02:48.349
Yeah.

01:02:48.516 --> 01:02:50.268
Now, I know your dad
doesn't totally trust humans...

01:02:50.435 --> 01:02:52.603
but I'm sure if he met them,
he would change his mind.

01:02:52.770 --> 01:02:54.230
They can help keep this place safe.

01:02:54.397 --> 01:02:55.440
Yeah, Blu...

01:02:55.606 --> 01:02:57.358
my dad knows what he's doing.

01:02:58.901 --> 01:03:02.780
And can't you just forget Linda and Tulio
for one minute and enjoy a sunset?

01:03:02.947 --> 01:03:04.699
But I thought that was our plan.

01:03:04.866 --> 01:03:06.576
<i>Route guidance complete.</i>

01:03:08.703 --> 01:03:12.707
You know, maybe some places
shouldn't be found.

01:03:13.291 --> 01:03:16.043
Maybe they should just be left alone.

01:03:19.422 --> 01:03:21.549
She ate a bug. A bug!

01:03:21.716 --> 01:03:23.801
Blu, Blu, Blu! Calm down.

01:03:23.968 --> 01:03:25.553
Calm down? We had a plan.

01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:27.889
Help Linda and Tulio find the flock
and get home.

01:03:28.055 --> 01:03:30.415
But when I mentioned it to her,
she completely shut me down.

01:03:31.809 --> 01:03:33.895
And her father? A total nut job.

01:03:34.061 --> 01:03:35.730
He's got this weird thing about humans.

01:03:35.897 --> 01:03:37.899
He's got this weird thing about humans!

01:03:38.065 --> 01:03:40.109
He loves them. He's a pet!

01:03:40.735 --> 01:03:41.736
A bet?

01:03:41.903 --> 01:03:43.112
He called me a pet.

01:03:43.279 --> 01:03:45.573
I can't believe he used
the "P" word to my face.

01:03:45.740 --> 01:03:47.325
It's like he thinks
I'm the enemy or something.

01:03:47.492 --> 01:03:50.745
He's not one of us, Roberto.
Keep an eye on him.

01:03:50.912 --> 01:03:53.164
And that Roberto? He is always watching.

01:03:53.331 --> 01:03:56.876
He is always hovering around Jewel.
He is always singing something.

01:03:57.043 --> 01:03:58.252
I can't compete with that.

01:03:58.419 --> 01:03:59.379
You gotta bird up, bird!

01:03:59.545 --> 01:04:01.714
You gotta emancipate yourself
from domestication.

01:04:01.881 --> 01:04:03.799
Try to see this place through her eyes.

01:04:03.966 --> 01:04:06.802
Taste the flavors she's tasting.

01:04:06.969 --> 01:04:08.262
So I should eat a bug?

01:04:08.429 --> 01:04:09.472
That's just nasty, thinking about it.

01:04:09.639 --> 01:04:11.557
Glitter. Where is my glitter?

01:04:11.724 --> 01:04:12.642
I'm sorry. Sorry.

01:04:12.808 --> 01:04:15.603
I don't want apologies. I want glitter.

01:04:16.145 --> 01:04:19.315
Glitter is absolutely essential
for a magical performance.

01:04:19.482 --> 01:04:21.275
- Do you know nothing?
- Guys!

01:04:21.442 --> 01:04:23.653
Rehearsals, big day tomorrow.

01:04:23.819 --> 01:04:26.989
Ring a bell? Come on.
You're coming, right, Dad?

01:04:27.156 --> 01:04:28.449
Oh, yeah, of course.

01:04:28.616 --> 01:04:31.494
That girl put the "business"
in "show business."

01:04:31.661 --> 01:04:32.620
Blu, remember...

01:04:32.787 --> 01:04:36.165
I know, I know. Happy wife, happy life.

01:04:40.628 --> 01:04:43.464
What a glorious morning!

01:04:46.842 --> 01:04:50.304
I forgot I could have
mornings like this.

01:04:56.310 --> 01:04:57.812
Yeah.

01:05:01.774 --> 01:05:02.984
Your favorite.

01:05:03.776 --> 01:05:05.152
You remembered.

01:05:05.319 --> 01:05:07.780
Isn't that nice?

01:05:11.659 --> 01:05:14.161
It's so crazy good.

01:05:14.328 --> 01:05:16.539
Thank you so much, Blu.

01:05:21.794 --> 01:05:23.379
That's it!

01:05:28.509 --> 01:05:30.511
I'll be the one to surprise her.

01:05:30.678 --> 01:05:33.723
Breakfast in bed, coming up.

01:06:10.051 --> 01:06:12.053
Brazil nuts.

01:06:12.219 --> 01:06:14.221
Where are you?

01:06:17.350 --> 01:06:19.518
I know you're around here somewhere.

01:06:22.938 --> 01:06:24.732
Hey! Hey.

01:06:24.899 --> 01:06:26.400
No! Come back here. Wait!

01:06:26.567 --> 01:06:27.860
No!

01:06:28.027 --> 01:06:28.944
That's not a toy.

01:06:29.278 --> 01:06:31.072
<i>Erratic driving. Pull over.</i>

01:06:40.956 --> 01:06:42.208
No, no. Don't do it.

01:07:03.104 --> 01:07:03.771
I got you!

01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:06.232
Thank you.

01:07:08.943 --> 01:07:09.735
Finally!

01:07:10.236 --> 01:07:11.612
Brazil nuts.

01:07:15.700 --> 01:07:18.786
This is my most important tool.

01:07:35.386 --> 01:07:39.390
Well, well, well. What do we have here?

01:07:41.434 --> 01:07:46.105
I guess old Eddie's rules
don't apply to everyone.

01:07:48.774 --> 01:07:50.776
You're on our side.

01:07:50.943 --> 01:07:52.403
Really? Okay, my bad.

01:07:52.570 --> 01:07:53.946
I didn't know that. Sorry.

01:07:54.989 --> 01:07:56.824
Sorry! Sorry.

01:07:58.159 --> 01:08:00.995
You come over here, take our food...

01:08:01.162 --> 01:08:03.164
and now you insult me?

01:08:04.248 --> 01:08:07.501
No, no, no.
This is all just a big misunderstanding.

01:08:08.169 --> 01:08:11.130
You know,
I wish I could accept your apology.

01:08:11.297 --> 01:08:14.008
You seem like a nice bird.

01:08:14.175 --> 01:08:15.593
But this means war!

01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:19.345
What? Does it have to?
Can it mean something else?

01:08:19.513 --> 01:08:22.099
Today, in the Pit of Doom.

01:08:22.808 --> 01:08:24.518
Sorry, the "Pit of Doom"? Really?

01:08:25.352 --> 01:08:26.270
Really?

01:08:26.437 --> 01:08:29.857
High noon. I'll make some room.

01:08:30.024 --> 01:08:32.609
Sweep you up like a broom.

01:08:40.201 --> 01:08:41.202
You did what?

01:08:41.368 --> 01:08:42.368
It was an accident.

01:08:42.495 --> 01:08:44.371
- An accident?
- Hey, what's going on?

01:08:44.537 --> 01:08:47.332
Thanks to Drew, here, we could lose
our entire side of the grove.

01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:49.794
I was just trying to get a nut. One nut!

01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:52.880
You don't even like nuts!
What's gotten into you, Blu?

01:08:53.046 --> 01:08:54.715
I was getting it for you.

01:08:54.881 --> 01:08:56.675
You were?

01:08:56.841 --> 01:08:59.220
Roberto, I want your best birds on this.

01:08:59.386 --> 01:09:01.055
We are not giving up without a fight.

01:09:01.221 --> 01:09:02.139
Got it.

01:09:02.305 --> 01:09:04.390
You. Stay out of it.

01:09:04.558 --> 01:09:05.725
You've done enough.

01:09:05.893 --> 01:09:07.394
- Wait!
- Blu, he's right.

01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:09.395
Maybe you should just let
Dad and Roberto handle it.

01:09:09.563 --> 01:09:11.064
You don't think I can do this?

01:09:11.232 --> 01:09:13.567
No, I just don't know...

01:09:13.734 --> 01:09:18.029
if it's your exact area of expertise.

01:09:18.488 --> 01:09:21.742
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Pit of Doom, now!

01:09:40.594 --> 01:09:42.095
Radio!

01:09:45.765 --> 01:09:47.893
I hope you don't mind.

01:09:48.685 --> 01:09:50.437
I made myself at home.

01:09:50.895 --> 01:09:52.523
Lollipop?

01:10:00.614 --> 01:10:05.411
It's a shame, really.
You came all this way to protect the jungle.

01:10:05.578 --> 01:10:08.539
Let's see if it will return the favor.

01:10:08.706 --> 01:10:10.457
Tree huggers.

01:10:21.552 --> 01:10:22.970
Roberto.

01:10:23.137 --> 01:10:24.889
Felipe.

01:10:27.933 --> 01:10:29.393
No mercy!

01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:30.603
I have to stop this.

01:10:30.769 --> 01:10:31.729
What? Blu!

01:10:31.896 --> 01:10:33.439
Stop! Stop!

01:10:33.606 --> 01:10:34.899
Eduardo, this is crazy.

01:10:35.065 --> 01:10:37.945
We are an intelligent species with
advanced problem-solving capabilities.

01:10:38.110 --> 01:10:40.654
You brought this on us. Now, watch.

01:10:54.335 --> 01:10:55.169
Heads.

01:10:55.336 --> 01:10:56.295
Tails.

01:10:57.713 --> 01:10:59.298
I hate this job.

01:11:05.638 --> 01:11:07.348
It's a game. It's a game!

01:11:07.514 --> 01:11:10.351
It's not a game! It's war.

01:11:12.686 --> 01:11:14.688
It's a beautiful day in the Pit of Doom!

01:11:14.855 --> 01:11:16.815
It's winner take all!

01:11:16.982 --> 01:11:18.359
It's the best of seven.

01:11:18.525 --> 01:11:22.655
The winner will take control
of the entire Brazil nut grove!

01:11:22.863 --> 01:11:24.573
It's just like soccer. I can do this.

01:11:24.740 --> 01:11:26.100
All right, any special strategies?

01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:27.993
What are we running at,
4-4-2 or a 5-4-1?

01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:30.037
What are we doing here, coach?
What position do I play?

01:11:30.204 --> 01:11:32.581
Actually, I do have
a perfect spot for you.

01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:36.210
Water. Water here. Get your water.

01:11:36.377 --> 01:11:37.252
Okay, thanks.

01:11:37.419 --> 01:11:41.924
Roberto is unstoppable!
He's incredible! He's everywhere!

01:11:42.091 --> 01:11:43.425
Go, Roberto!

01:11:43.592 --> 01:11:44.718
I could have done that.

01:11:44.885 --> 01:11:46.095
Roberto springs free!

01:11:46.261 --> 01:11:48.421
There he goes, there he goes, there he goes!
He shoots!

01:11:49.932 --> 01:11:50.933
Goal!

01:11:51.100 --> 01:11:51.934
Goal!

01:11:52.101 --> 01:11:54.103
Goal! Goal!

01:11:54.269 --> 01:11:55.896
Goal!

01:11:58.399 --> 01:11:59.566
Oh, my!

01:12:00.943 --> 01:12:02.945
Felipe has the ball. The Red Macaws...

01:12:03.112 --> 01:12:04.238
are making a comeback.

01:12:04.405 --> 01:12:06.115
Felipe pass to Tito. Tito with Mario.

01:12:06.281 --> 01:12:08.409
Mario with Cesar. Cesar to Antonio.

01:12:08.575 --> 01:12:10.244
Felipe scores!

01:12:10.577 --> 01:12:13.038
Yes! In your face!

01:12:13.205 --> 01:12:16.250
Felipe, Roberto. Roberto, Felipe.
Roberto, Felipe. Felipe, Roberto!

01:12:20.754 --> 01:12:22.047
Goal!

01:12:24.133 --> 01:12:25.092
That has got to hurt.

01:12:25.259 --> 01:12:26.593
Go, go!

01:12:27.636 --> 01:12:31.432
Felipe-lipe-lipe!

01:12:32.766 --> 01:12:33.767
Hey!

01:12:33.934 --> 01:12:34.768
Foul!

01:12:34.935 --> 01:12:36.061
Come on, ref!

01:12:37.604 --> 01:12:38.605
Okay, you're in.

01:12:38.772 --> 01:12:39.398
Really?

01:12:39.565 --> 01:12:40.941
Not you. You.

01:12:41.900 --> 01:12:43.110
Watch and learn...

01:12:43.277 --> 01:12:44.445
water boy.

01:12:45.821 --> 01:12:47.573
All right, just get in there.

01:12:47.781 --> 01:12:48.490
Yes!

01:12:49.575 --> 01:12:51.118
Okay. Here we go, coach.

01:12:51.285 --> 01:12:52.119
Yeah, Dad!

01:12:52.286 --> 01:12:55.831
A new player is coming off the bench.
Is he a secret weapon?

01:12:57.249 --> 01:12:58.751
I think it's the water boy.

01:12:58.917 --> 01:12:59.918
Hey. I'm open!

01:13:00.085 --> 01:13:01.462
I'm open, toss it to me!

01:13:01.628 --> 01:13:04.256
Hey, pass to me, I'm open.
I'm wide open!

01:13:04.423 --> 01:13:06.467
Pass the ball to me!

01:13:08.844 --> 01:13:10.262
Thanks for the pass, Blu!

01:13:10.429 --> 01:13:11.309
Mind if I borrow this?

01:13:11.597 --> 01:13:13.474
Roberto moves in. He shakes one...

01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:14.516
then another!

01:13:14.683 --> 01:13:15.642
Roberto!

01:13:15.809 --> 01:13:17.144
Goal!

01:13:17.311 --> 01:13:20.147
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

01:13:28.322 --> 01:13:29.990
We are tied in the Pit of Doom.

01:13:30.157 --> 01:13:31.825
Whoever scores next...

01:13:31.992 --> 01:13:33.202
wins it all!

01:13:33.494 --> 01:13:34.995
I got it, I got it!

01:13:37.289 --> 01:13:38.290
Come on, Blu.

01:13:43.462 --> 01:13:46.882
Wow! The water boy is suddenly
playing like a pro!

01:13:54.181 --> 01:13:55.516
Pass the ball to Roberto!

01:13:57.976 --> 01:13:59.686
Pass the ball! Pass the ball!

01:13:59.853 --> 01:14:02.356
- Blu, wait!
- No, this bird's got it covered.

01:14:18.580 --> 01:14:20.415
Goal!

01:14:27.548 --> 01:14:30.551
It looks like the secret weapon
just backfired!

01:14:30.717 --> 01:14:33.220
Let's go to Eduardo for his reaction.

01:14:34.721 --> 01:14:38.016
I'm gonna kill you, fanny pack!

01:14:47.901 --> 01:14:49.194
Check it out, old Eddie.

01:14:49.361 --> 01:14:53.073
Looks like you guys are
going to have to start a nut-free diet.

01:14:54.700 --> 01:14:57.411
We're gonna be talking about that
for a long time.

01:15:01.540 --> 01:15:05.127
I should never have expected more
from a human's pet.

01:15:20.934 --> 01:15:22.311
Hey.

01:15:23.937 --> 01:15:26.607
What happened back there?

01:15:26.773 --> 01:15:28.984
I was trying to be one of the tribe.

01:15:29.151 --> 01:15:32.321
But I guess I'm never gonna be
"the bird" like your dad wants me to be.

01:15:32.487 --> 01:15:35.657
- What?
- I think it's time to go home.

01:15:35.824 --> 01:15:37.576
We should talk about this.

01:15:37.743 --> 01:15:39.286
Talk about what?

01:15:39.453 --> 01:15:40.787
Blu, look around.

01:15:40.954 --> 01:15:45.459
The kids are thriving.
They love being in the wild.

01:15:46.293 --> 01:15:48.128
Maybe this place is home.

01:15:48.295 --> 01:15:50.589
Home? How could this be home?

01:15:50.756 --> 01:15:52.941
I have done everything I can
to fit in and help out...

01:15:52.966 --> 01:15:54.509
but no matter what I do, it's wrong.

01:15:54.676 --> 01:15:56.136
That's not home, Jewel.

01:15:56.303 --> 01:15:59.139
Maybe for you, but not for me.

01:15:59.306 --> 01:16:02.142
You know what?
You need to figure out what you want.

01:16:02.309 --> 01:16:07.314
And maybe, stop thinking about just yourself
and start thinking about us.

01:16:45.519 --> 01:16:46.687
Hey, you heard the boss.

01:16:46.853 --> 01:16:48.313
Move out! Let's go!

01:16:53.986 --> 01:16:55.737
Beautiful.

01:17:11.336 --> 01:17:13.880
Linda! Tulio!

01:17:22.347 --> 01:17:24.224
Goodbye, Linda.

01:17:29.855 --> 01:17:31.398
Goodbye, fanny pack.

01:17:31.565 --> 01:17:33.734
<i>Turn around when possible.</i>

01:17:33.900 --> 01:17:37.738
Sorry, GPS lady. It's not you. It's me.

01:17:38.238 --> 01:17:41.908
Goodbye, pancakes. Goodbye, coffee.

01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:45.329
Goodbye, coffee.

01:17:49.082 --> 01:17:50.584
Linda?

01:17:51.752 --> 01:17:52.753
Linda!

01:17:57.966 --> 01:17:59.009
Eduardo was right!

01:17:59.176 --> 01:18:00.736
- Traitor!
- Wait, you don't understand.

01:18:00.844 --> 01:18:03.096
What don't I understand?
Siding with humans?

01:18:03.263 --> 01:18:04.663
What do you even know about humans?

01:18:05.182 --> 01:18:08.769
I know everything.
They lure you in, they trap you.

01:18:08.935 --> 01:18:10.604
They destroy your mind!

01:18:10.771 --> 01:18:12.689
Polly want a cracker?
Polly want a cracker?

01:18:12.856 --> 01:18:14.691
No! Enough crackers!

01:18:14.858 --> 01:18:16.360
I hate crackers!

01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:21.156
Come on, Roberto!

01:18:21.323 --> 01:18:22.674
It's them. It's them!

01:18:22.699 --> 01:18:23.784
It's them!

01:18:24.785 --> 01:18:25.665
Roberto, get out of...

01:18:29.122 --> 01:18:31.792
Not again! Not again!
No more crackers!

01:18:32.626 --> 01:18:33.543
Snap out of it!

01:18:34.795 --> 01:18:35.462
Look...

01:18:35.629 --> 01:18:37.229
we've got one chance to stop this, okay?

01:18:37.381 --> 01:18:38.357
I have to find my friends.

01:18:38.382 --> 01:18:40.217
You fly back and warn the others.
You got it?

01:18:40.384 --> 01:18:41.468
Yeah. I got it.

01:18:41.635 --> 01:18:42.969
- Okay. Go!
- Okay!

01:18:46.139 --> 01:18:48.475
Humans, humans!

01:18:52.312 --> 01:18:53.814
- Your left! Your right!
- My left?

01:18:53.980 --> 01:18:55.315
Left or right?

01:18:58.235 --> 01:19:00.070
- Your right leg, my left leg.
- Okay.

01:19:00.237 --> 01:19:02.322
Good! Good! Good!

01:19:02.489 --> 01:19:04.324
- Now, go up.
- Go up.

01:19:05.992 --> 01:19:06.660
Reach!

01:19:06.993 --> 01:19:08.370
Almost there!

01:19:10.997 --> 01:19:11.998
Linda...

01:19:12.499 --> 01:19:14.000
I'm so sorry.

01:19:14.167 --> 01:19:15.961
As bad as this is...

01:19:16.128 --> 01:19:20.674
there is no place I would rather be
in the whole world than with you.

01:19:20.841 --> 01:19:23.343
Even if it is tied to a tree.

01:19:29.516 --> 01:19:30.851
Linda!

01:19:32.352 --> 01:19:33.061
Blu!

01:19:33.645 --> 01:19:34.479
Blu!

01:19:34.813 --> 01:19:36.148
- Linda?
- Down here!

01:19:37.983 --> 01:19:39.359
What? Blu!

01:19:39.526 --> 01:19:42.195
What are you doing here?
This is dangerous!

01:19:42.362 --> 01:19:44.865
That's incredible!
It's a 2,000-mile flight!

01:19:45.031 --> 01:19:46.391
- Let's follow him!
- It's amazing!

01:19:47.826 --> 01:19:49.661
I told you I heard him.

01:20:06.219 --> 01:20:07.762
I'll take those.

01:20:39.920 --> 01:20:41.671
Game over!
It's over!

01:20:41.838 --> 01:20:43.924
Humans! The lights!

01:20:45.050 --> 01:20:46.343
It's over!

01:20:46.510 --> 01:20:48.512
He's been blabbering like this
since we found him.

01:20:48.678 --> 01:20:50.722
The loggers are coming!
And Blu is with them!

01:20:50.889 --> 01:20:51.848
- Traitor!
- No!

01:20:52.015 --> 01:20:53.433
No, Blu is trying to help us.

01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:54.851
What? By himself?

01:20:55.018 --> 01:20:56.603
Let's evacuate! We're leaving.

01:20:56.770 --> 01:20:57.938
Let's go. Everyone move out.

01:20:58.104 --> 01:20:59.272
- Go, go, go!
- Dad?

01:20:59.439 --> 01:21:01.233
No, not this time.
I'm not going with you.

01:21:01.399 --> 01:21:04.194
You have to go with me!
I will not put my family in danger again.

01:21:04.361 --> 01:21:07.030
Blu is my family,
and I'm not leaving him behind.

01:21:07.197 --> 01:21:08.949
You don't have to.

01:21:11.201 --> 01:21:12.786
Are you okay?

01:21:14.788 --> 01:21:18.208
Look, Eduardo, I might not be
the birdliest bird in the flock...

01:21:18.375 --> 01:21:20.293
but, for once,
that's actually a good thing.

01:21:20.627 --> 01:21:21.795
You know the jungle...

01:21:21.962 --> 01:21:23.463
I know humans.

01:21:23.630 --> 01:21:25.715
And I know that, together,
we can stop them.

01:21:26.424 --> 01:21:28.468
We can't let them take our home.

01:21:28.635 --> 01:21:31.721
Sure, it's hot and loud
and filled with creepy bugs...

01:21:31.972 --> 01:21:33.431
but it's ours.

01:21:33.598 --> 01:21:35.809
Let's fight for it. Who's with me?

01:21:35.976 --> 01:21:37.269
I'm with you!

01:21:39.604 --> 01:21:40.647
Anybody else?

01:21:49.114 --> 01:21:50.824
Stop! Stop!

01:21:52.450 --> 01:21:53.827
Stop!

01:21:57.163 --> 01:22:00.166
Stop!

01:22:06.131 --> 01:22:09.092
Yeah. Respect the rainforest!

01:22:25.442 --> 01:22:27.902
I knew it! I knew it!

01:22:31.865 --> 01:22:34.159
Hey. Where do you think you're going?

01:22:34.326 --> 01:22:37.203
It's just a bunch of pigeons.

01:22:37.370 --> 01:22:38.830
Get back to work!

01:22:42.667 --> 01:22:44.252
Lead the way, Blu.

01:22:44.419 --> 01:22:46.296
That's my name! Yes! You called me Blu.

01:22:46.463 --> 01:22:48.131
Yes, I am Blu!

01:22:48.298 --> 01:22:50.216
What? Right.

01:22:50.383 --> 01:22:51.843
Birds of blue feathers...

01:22:52.010 --> 01:22:54.095
Have to stick together!

01:23:06.191 --> 01:23:08.902
Everybody ready? And under!

01:23:11.488 --> 01:23:12.030
Over!

01:23:15.575 --> 01:23:16.326
Backwards!

01:23:22.123 --> 01:23:22.540
<i><font color="#ff8000">I</font> will survive
I will survive</i>

01:23:22.540 --> 01:23:22.874
<i><font color="#ff8000">I will</font> survive
I will survive</i>

01:23:22.875 --> 01:23:23.749
<i><font color="#ff8000">I will survive</font>
I will survive</i>

01:23:23.750 --> 01:23:24.084
<i><font color="#ff8000">I will survive
I</font> will survive</i>

01:23:24.084 --> 01:23:24.418

I will</font> survive</i>

01:23:24.419 --> 01:23:25.752
<i><font color="#ff8000">I will survive
I will survive</font></i>

01:23:29.255 --> 01:23:31.466
- Got him!
- Wow, precise.

01:23:32.092 --> 01:23:34.803
I ain't afraid of no birds.

01:23:38.390 --> 01:23:40.058
Attack!

01:23:40.225 --> 01:23:41.810
It's on in the Amazon.

01:23:41.976 --> 01:23:43.728
All right, hit it!

01:23:46.398 --> 01:23:47.607
High-five!

01:23:53.196 --> 01:23:55.073
Why? Why?

01:23:55.240 --> 01:23:56.616
Get a grip!

01:24:00.662 --> 01:24:02.539
Incoming!

01:24:06.376 --> 01:24:07.919
Halt!

01:24:09.003 --> 01:24:10.380
There he is.

01:24:10.547 --> 01:24:13.466
Charlie, prepare the nose-zooka.

01:24:14.217 --> 01:24:15.343
Tiago!

01:24:15.510 --> 01:24:16.928
Now we're talking.

01:24:17.095 --> 01:24:17.971
Ready...

01:24:18.138 --> 01:24:19.222
aim...

01:24:19.389 --> 01:24:20.306
fire!

01:24:24.394 --> 01:24:26.104
Foiled again.

01:24:27.981 --> 01:24:30.150
- Good job, Tiago.
- We're a great team, Dad!

01:24:30.316 --> 01:24:31.776
- Hey, old Eddie.
- Felipe.

01:24:31.943 --> 01:24:34.904
You think I would miss this party?
Game on!

01:24:39.159 --> 01:24:40.827
Hey! Come back!

01:24:41.077 --> 01:24:42.996
You're useless, all of you!

01:24:43.621 --> 01:24:44.622
Look out!

01:24:48.668 --> 01:24:51.337
Pick on someone your own size.

01:24:59.179 --> 01:25:00.138
No! No!

01:25:00.305 --> 01:25:04.809
I got you, I got you.
It's okay, you're safe now.

01:25:11.524 --> 01:25:13.526
That's a Linda.

01:25:20.283 --> 01:25:21.034
Yeah!

01:25:24.788 --> 01:25:26.581
We still got it, Blu!

01:25:36.633 --> 01:25:39.552
I have to do everything myself.

01:25:44.474 --> 01:25:46.142
Hey! Get away from that!

01:25:46.309 --> 01:25:49.229
No! No one steals my scene.

01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:56.903
Lollipop?

01:26:03.243 --> 01:26:03.910
What?

01:26:06.037 --> 01:26:07.622
What are you doing? Let go!

01:26:07.789 --> 01:26:08.748
Save yourself!

01:26:10.750 --> 01:26:11.918
Come on, let go!

01:26:12.210 --> 01:26:14.087
- Never!
- Are you crazy?

01:26:14.254 --> 01:26:16.047
You'll bring both of us down! Let go!

01:26:17.590 --> 01:26:18.424
Fly!

01:26:19.217 --> 01:26:20.802
Déjà Vu, Blu.

01:26:20.969 --> 01:26:21.719
Nigel!

01:26:23.471 --> 01:26:24.472
Blu!

01:26:25.932 --> 01:26:27.475
Nigel!

01:26:49.622 --> 01:26:50.623
You.

01:26:51.583 --> 01:26:55.837
You will pay a painful price
for your pestilence!

01:26:56.004 --> 01:26:57.797
Hey, stop that! Get off of me!

01:26:57.964 --> 01:27:00.466
A flurry of furious feathers
in your face!

01:27:00.633 --> 01:27:02.176
You don't have to do this!

01:27:02.343 --> 01:27:04.429
No, I just want to.

01:27:04.596 --> 01:27:05.638
Hey, stop! Stop!

01:27:05.805 --> 01:27:08.641
Oh, my goodness. Charlie!
This is it. This is it!

01:27:08.808 --> 01:27:10.602
Steady. Steady.

01:27:10.768 --> 01:27:12.020
Slap fight!

01:27:14.939 --> 01:27:16.149
Shoot! Shoot!

01:27:24.824 --> 01:27:25.658
Nigel!

01:27:37.837 --> 01:27:39.881
Is this the end?

01:27:40.048 --> 01:27:41.507
I was too young...

01:27:41.674 --> 01:27:44.385
too beautiful to live.

01:27:47.847 --> 01:27:50.016
- Bob?
- Hold up! That ain't Bob!

01:27:50.183 --> 01:27:52.060
I told you I knew him from somewhere.

01:27:52.226 --> 01:27:54.270
My final curtain call.

01:27:55.021 --> 01:27:57.690
And it's standing room only.

01:27:58.733 --> 01:28:00.360
Good bye.

01:28:15.208 --> 01:28:16.459
No!

01:28:16.626 --> 01:28:18.461
No! What have I done?

01:28:18.628 --> 01:28:20.546
If I cannot liveth with thee...

01:28:20.713 --> 01:28:23.383
then I shall not liveth at all.

01:28:47.240 --> 01:28:48.992
That frog is not poisonous.

01:28:49.158 --> 01:28:50.410
What?

01:28:50.576 --> 01:28:51.828
We're not dead?

01:28:51.995 --> 01:28:55.164
It's a very common mistake.
But she's a harmless pseudo-<i>Dendrobates.</i>

01:28:55.331 --> 01:28:56.791
You can tell by the pink spots.

01:28:56.958 --> 01:29:01.087
But my parents always told me I was poisonous
and shouldn't touch anyone.

01:29:01.504 --> 01:29:03.589
You just had really mean parents.

01:29:03.923 --> 01:29:05.258
Oh, wow.

01:29:05.425 --> 01:29:06.759
So, now...

01:29:07.635 --> 01:29:09.012
we can be together!

01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:17.854
- Nigel! Nigel-Wigel-Wigglepuss!
- No!

01:29:18.021 --> 01:29:20.940
- Somebody, help me!
- I'm going to never let you go.

01:29:21.107 --> 01:29:22.775
- I'm sorry, I'll be nicer. No!
- Never gonna let you go!

01:29:22.942 --> 01:29:24.193
No, Charlie!

01:29:24.777 --> 01:29:26.779
Charlie!

01:29:27.697 --> 01:29:29.991
This is unnatural!

01:29:43.796 --> 01:29:45.631
Hey, guys! Hi!

01:29:46.758 --> 01:29:48.468
There's nothing in my hair, right? Okay.

01:29:49.010 --> 01:29:51.345
Directly from the heart of the
Amazon rainforest...

01:29:51.512 --> 01:29:53.222
we have some breaking news.

01:29:53.389 --> 01:29:55.349
Thanks to Dr. Monteiro and his team...

01:29:55.516 --> 01:30:00.021
the entire area will be designated
as a National Wildlife Refuge.

01:30:00.188 --> 01:30:03.191
And together,
we'll make sure this place stays safe.

01:30:03.357 --> 01:30:04.358
Right, Blu?

01:30:05.818 --> 01:30:07.904
But that's not the only good news.

01:30:08.071 --> 01:30:10.198
We found this cockatoo
deep in the Amazon...

01:30:10.364 --> 01:30:12.909
and he seems to have bonded
with a tree frog.

01:30:13.076 --> 01:30:16.996
We are bringing them back to Rio
for continuing observation.

01:30:18.081 --> 01:30:21.542
Oh, Nigel! Wow!
A honeymoon in Rio!

01:30:24.504 --> 01:30:26.547
Put your paws, talons
and tails together...

01:30:26.714 --> 01:30:29.592
for the most amazing talent
ever gathered in one jungle.

01:30:29.759 --> 01:30:33.387
It's "Amazon Untamed!"

01:30:33.554 --> 01:30:35.389
Come on! Get up!

01:30:35.556 --> 01:30:36.516
Yeah!
