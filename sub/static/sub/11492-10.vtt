What about him?

12:05.310 --> 12:07.178
Well, I don't know if
you're aware of this,

12:07.179 --> 12:08.980
but he went through
a bad breakup recently,

12:08.981 --> 12:10.365
and he may not look like it,

12:10.366 --> 12:12.517
but he's actually in a pretty
vulnerable place right now.

12:12.518 --> 12:14.352

I'm taking advantage of him?

12:28.334 --> 12:30.768
Well, he likes buying me
things. Makes him happy.

12:30.769 --> 12:35.006
Believe me, the money is fun,
but it's Charlie I care about.

And when Rose got married?

14:21.212 --> 14:22.413
All of that was necessary

14:22.414 --> 14:24.281
in order for me to
get back to Courtney.

14:24.282 --> 14:27.985

Courtney to make early parole.

meant to happen!

14:30.188 --> 14:31.655
