00:45.963 --> 00:48.674
I wanna be the best surfer in the world.

01:06.942 --> 01:09.403
I'm gonna be the best surfer in the world, not you.

01:11.864 --> 01:14.867
She's just slotted in there. Look at that wave.

01:14.992 --> 01:17.995
Anne Marie Chadwick getting the best wave of the day.

01:31.550 --> 01:33.594
Anne Marie...

03:00.973 --> 03:04.560
Hey, howzit, wave riders. It's hump day,
Wednesday, February 3.

03:04.643 --> 03:07.104
Waves are averaging 14 feet in 18 seconds.

03:07.229 --> 03:11.400
So there's definitely some size out there
in the water, and it's moving our way.

03:11.525 --> 03:13.569
There's a little bit of morning
sickness out right now,

03:13.652 --> 03:15.821
but it should clean up as the winds pick up...

03:40.304 --> 03:43.182
It's flat. Yeah, right. I'm looking at it.

03:43.307 --> 03:45.893
Anne Marie? What's up,J.J.?

03:46.018 --> 03:49.188
Tell Eden she's a hottie. Hook me up.

03:49.313 --> 03:52.149
Tell her yourself. How's Pipe looking?

03:52.191 --> 03:55.903
Ho! It's going off. It's at least double overhead.

03:55.986 --> 03:58.280
- You better get down here.
- Okay. Thanks, J.J.

03:58.322 --> 04:01.450
Pen. Pen, come on. Get up.

04:01.575 --> 04:05.913
Pen. Get up. It's double overhead.

04:10.042 --> 04:12.169
Lena. Hey, Lena.

04:12.211 --> 04:15.339
What? It's double overhead.

04:15.339 --> 04:18.926
- What?

04:21.762 --> 04:25.766
How's it coming?

04:25.891 --> 04:28.894
I can't get the rails right.
They're too pinched.

04:28.936 --> 04:32.648
You wanna get wet?
I got to glass before work.

04:32.773 --> 04:35.484
It's perfect Pipe.

04:35.526 --> 04:38.529
For real? For real.

04:38.612 --> 04:41.365
- Move it.
- Yeah, move it.

04:41.365 --> 04:44.660
- Move. Let's go.
- Let's do it.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.537
Okay, got my noodles. Let's go.

04:58.507 --> 05:00.509
Turn it up.

05:05.639 --> 05:07.933
- Whoo!

05:07.975 --> 05:09.977
It's going off!

05:23.282 --> 05:25.242
What's up, bro?

05:27.286 --> 05:29.580
Great. The Rat Pack's here.

05:32.583 --> 05:34.585
Hey, what's up, guys?

05:34.585 --> 05:36.962
Hey, Rico, what's up? Hey, girls.

05:37.004 --> 05:39.006
We should have been here an hour ago.

05:39.131 --> 05:42.009
If you would have gotten moving,
we would have been. We're all right.

05:42.134 --> 05:45.137
What's up, Tamayo? Hey, how's it, girls?

05:45.179 --> 05:49.725
How is it out there? Oh, it's pretty nuts.
Broke my board.

05:52.144 --> 05:55.314
It's pretty heavy out there.
Your girl got her head on straight this time?

05:55.314 --> 05:57.733
Does she? You know it.

06:23.175 --> 06:25.219
- Oh, look who's here.
- What are you girls doing here?

06:25.344 --> 06:29.056
We came to surf Pipe.
Why don't you check out girlie bowls?

06:29.181 --> 06:31.642
Why don't you crawl back
into the cave you came from?

06:31.642 --> 06:34.520
Why don't I knock you in the head,
drag you in there with me? Huh?

06:34.645 --> 06:37.648
I like girls that are rough and soft inside.

06:37.773 --> 06:40.192
I'm gonna have to marry you, girl. Let her go.

06:40.234 --> 06:42.236
Seriously, let her go.
We're out of here. Okay.

06:42.319 --> 06:44.655
What's this I hear about
you surfing the Pipe Masters?

06:44.780 --> 06:46.657
It's a surfing contest, not a drowning contest.

06:46.782 --> 06:50.494
Hey, stop hassling my girl.
She's gonna dominate. Let's see it.

06:50.536 --> 06:52.496
I don't mind girls that can charge Pipe.

06:52.538 --> 06:54.498
Chick thinks she can charge Pipe.
That's cool.

06:54.540 --> 06:56.834
You think you can surf it for real?

06:56.917 --> 07:00.087
I dated you, Drew.
I guess I can do anything, huh?

07:00.087 --> 07:03.674
I'll get my boys out there.
We'll block every wave you want.

07:03.674 --> 07:06.635
No matter how big it is, we want you on it.
Let's see what's gonna happen.

07:06.677 --> 07:10.931
- Let's do it.
- Don't talk bubbles to me.

07:19.690 --> 07:22.109
So meet us at the shower at 7:45?
Okay.

07:22.234 --> 07:25.112
And stay on the inside. Be careful, Pen.
Okay. All right.

07:39.710 --> 07:42.963
Oh. Looks like the reef's breaking down.

07:48.427 --> 07:51.013
Oh, he got shut down.

07:56.602 --> 08:00.022
It's heavy out there. It's fierce.

08:05.277 --> 08:09.031
Ohh.! Oh, he hit the reef.

08:11.909 --> 08:14.328
That's gotta hurt.

08:14.453 --> 08:17.915
I think we should start at the sandbar
and work our way over.

08:17.915 --> 08:19.917
I won't argue with that.

08:59.081 --> 09:04.378
- Yeah! Go, Lena!

09:57.890 --> 10:01.560
I want to get a boat so we can go around
the island and get some killer secret spots.

10:01.602 --> 10:03.854
Guaranteed. There's so many. Oh, God, I know.

10:03.896 --> 10:07.441
Hey! What's this horseshit on the sandbar crap?

10:07.608 --> 10:10.319
You're not gonna win
the Masters surfing the sandbar.

10:10.319 --> 10:13.197
Talking this crap on the beach. "I dated you,
Drew. I can do anything."

10:13.280 --> 10:16.992
This isn't Pipe. Pipe's over there. Let's go.

10:17.034 --> 10:19.453
The Pipe's over there.
The boys are gonna block for you.

10:19.578 --> 10:22.206
Let's do this. Let's go.

10:22.289 --> 10:24.291
Come on.

10:28.045 --> 10:30.756
Whoo! Yeah!

10:44.937 --> 10:46.939
Let's go, man.

10:47.940 --> 10:50.067
Actions speak louder than words.

10:51.944 --> 10:54.655
Oh, that's the view I remember.
What, the one of me leaving?

10:54.780 --> 10:56.532
It's my favorite too.

11:02.246 --> 11:04.373
Come on, pick it up.

11:07.668 --> 11:10.921
Like that wave, huh? Next one's yours.

11:24.393 --> 11:28.689
Welcome to the arena, girl.
Let's get you into something big.

11:28.814 --> 11:31.275
What's up, Anne Marie? Where you been?
Thought you were behind us.

11:31.275 --> 11:33.652
Today's your big day. Let's do it.

11:33.694 --> 11:36.947
Hey, everybody, this is my girl, Anne Marie.
She's with the boys.

11:36.989 --> 11:41.243
She's gonna get some waves. Any of
you get in her way, you're gonna deal with me.

11:41.285 --> 11:45.289
Here we go. Paddle.! Paddle.! Come on.! Move.!

11:45.289 --> 11:48.542
Watch out.! Watch out.!
Spring girl's wave. Hit it.!

11:51.295 --> 11:53.547
Come on! Paddle in!

11:53.589 --> 11:56.425
- Come on!
- Paddle.! Paddle.! Paddle.!

12:02.598 --> 12:05.434
What the hell is that?

12:07.853 --> 12:12.566
- God.! You ain't even paddling.
- Girls can't surf Pipe.

12:12.608 --> 12:16.612
What the hell was that?
What the hell is she afraid of?

12:22.743 --> 12:25.746
- This ain't a beauty pageant.
- Oh, if you do that again, you're barred.

12:25.746 --> 12:28.582
Come on, Anne Marie, you got to do it
this time. No fooling around.

12:28.624 --> 12:30.626
Let's do it.

12:36.048 --> 12:39.927
This one's yours right here. Don't blow it.
Or I ain't gonna help you anymore.

12:40.052 --> 12:42.930
Come on. Paddle, paddle.! This one's yours,
Anne Marie.! Go.! Go.!

12:47.518 --> 12:49.770
Yeah, yeah, yeah.!

12:51.355 --> 12:53.524
Ohh!

13:09.957 --> 13:12.543
You were in the perfect spot.
You were right where you needed to be.

13:12.626 --> 13:14.670
Whatever. That thing was a beast.
Just dropped out.

13:14.795 --> 13:16.672
How big was it?

13:16.797 --> 13:20.259
It was solid. It was, like, triple overhead.

13:20.384 --> 13:23.971
She totally had it. Yeah.
She just needed to paddle a little harder.

13:23.971 --> 13:26.223
I don't know.

13:26.265 --> 13:29.393
It's all in your head. It's all up here.

13:29.393 --> 13:32.938
If you just would have committed,
you could have made that wave.

13:32.980 --> 13:35.107
Whatever. At least she went.
That wave was huge.

13:35.232 --> 13:38.110
- I would have never gone.
- She was perfectly positioned.

13:38.235 --> 13:40.571
If she had the balls to charge...
Why does the sun rise in the east?

13:40.654 --> 13:43.574
What? Why does the sun rise in the east?

13:43.574 --> 13:45.701
Because it sets in the west.

13:45.826 --> 13:47.703
Because that's the way the Earth rotates.

13:47.828 --> 13:50.414
Do you remember that Superman episode...

13:50.539 --> 13:54.293
where he was, like, spinning
around the Earth backwards...

13:54.418 --> 13:57.004
trying to rotate it in the other direction?

13:57.004 --> 13:59.256
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. To bring back time?

13:59.298 --> 14:02.176
- I thought you finished.
- I did. I'm just checking it.

14:02.301 --> 14:04.720
- It doesn't look like you're finished.
- Geez. Stop picking on her.

14:04.720 --> 14:06.597
She's getting it done now.

14:06.722 --> 14:09.892
We're on our way to school.
She should have it done.

14:09.975 --> 14:13.604
- She's just checking it.
- I did it last night. I'm checking it.

14:17.441 --> 14:19.276
Penny.! Penny.! What?

14:19.318 --> 14:21.904
Flippers.

14:21.987 --> 14:23.906
- No ditching.
- Okay.

14:25.032 --> 14:28.035
- It sucks to be you.
- Yeah, it does.

14:28.202 --> 14:30.746
Someone's got to go to college, honey.
Not me.

14:30.871 --> 14:32.915
Oh, shoot! It's Mr. Pakui.

14:33.040 --> 14:35.167
Remember how he had pee stains all the time?

14:35.209 --> 14:37.044
Looks like he learned how to shake right.

14:37.169 --> 14:39.338
Hi, Mr. Pakui. Anne Marie,
This is the eighth time...

14:39.463 --> 14:41.882
your sister's been tardy in the last month.

14:41.924 --> 14:44.510
I know. Traffic... If you think surfing is
more important than school,

14:44.635 --> 14:46.595
we got to make other arrangements.

14:46.637 --> 14:51.308
You know what, Mr. Pakui, The only other arrangement 
I can think of is my mother.

14:51.350 --> 14:53.936
And she just so happens to be with her
latest meal ticket in Vegas...

14:54.061 --> 14:57.773
who apparently isn't so cool
with the kid's menu, you know what I mean?

14:57.898 --> 15:00.359
So right now, this is the best arrangement I can do.

15:00.359 --> 15:03.237
You know, Penny's a smart girl.
Yeah, she is.

15:03.362 --> 15:05.948
Just like her sister was.

15:06.073 --> 15:10.661
Is. Present tense. I learned that much
while I was here.

15:10.828 --> 15:12.663
You better watch it, girl.

15:12.830 --> 15:15.958
I'm doing the best I can do.
That's all I can say.

15:16.083 --> 15:18.544
You can do better. All right.

15:19.837 --> 15:21.797
God!

15:21.839 --> 15:25.676
Like, he's so ripping in that aloha shirt anyway.
I thought he was hot.

15:25.676 --> 15:28.846
You did kind of peak in seventh grade.
Shut up, Lena.

15:28.971 --> 15:34.518
Sexually, she means. What is this, like,
bag on Anne Marie?

15:34.560 --> 15:36.562
Whoo!

15:38.981 --> 15:41.859
Seventeen fifty-three.
That's kama'aina price?

15:41.859 --> 15:43.652
No kama'aina for candy. Ohh.

15:43.694 --> 15:45.404
Come on, Leilani, it's breakfast. Yeah.

15:45.571 --> 15:48.949
Breakfast? Right. Sorry, girls. $17.53.
This has corn syrup in it.

15:48.991 --> 15:51.118
It's a vegetable. It's nutritional.

15:51.243 --> 15:54.955
No. It has sugar. It turns into fat.
And fat comes out like me. Okay?

15:54.997 --> 15:59.168
So, $17.53. All right, I've got five.

15:59.251 --> 16:01.587
- How much do you have?
- I got some cash.

16:01.587 --> 16:05.424
- Hold on, I got, like...
- What is this?

16:05.424 --> 16:08.719
I don't know, like 70, 60...

16:08.719 --> 16:10.888
That's pathetic. What is that?

16:10.888 --> 16:13.307
I didn't say I had a lot. I said I had some.

16:13.432 --> 16:15.434
What happened to the five bucks
I gave you yesterday?

16:15.559 --> 16:17.853
I bought food for Sammi.
It's not even our dog.

16:17.895 --> 16:19.897
Dog's gotta eat. So do I. I'm hungry.

16:19.980 --> 16:22.733
- Eat the rest of this Twinkie.
- I don't want it. I want breakfast.

16:22.733 --> 16:25.861
- Twinkie is breakfast. -

16:25.903 --> 16:28.906
It's Keala Kennelly. She's living the life.

16:28.989 --> 16:32.159
Must be here for the contest.
Check thosejet skis out.

16:32.201 --> 16:34.620
- So fine.
- All right, let's fill these bad boys.

16:34.745 --> 16:36.622
Let's get on it. It's gonna be a busy day.

16:36.622 --> 16:40.501
She's with her Billabong sponsor.
Introduce yourself. No.

16:40.584 --> 16:42.753
Why not? It's not weird.
Because it's weird.

16:42.753 --> 16:45.047
Yes. No.

16:45.047 --> 16:47.341
- Hi. Can we have your autograph?
- Yeah, sure.

16:47.466 --> 16:49.051
I'll get you a pen. Thanks.

16:49.051 --> 16:51.595
Hey, I remember this shot.  What a life.

16:51.637 --> 16:53.889
She gets a grand every time she's in a magazine.

16:53.931 --> 16:55.641
Five grand every time she's on the cover.

16:55.766 --> 16:57.351
- You surf?
- Yeah.

16:57.476 --> 17:01.063
She gets free clothes,
boards, watches, sunglasses.

17:01.230 --> 17:03.649
The girl doesn't have to open her wallet.

17:03.649 --> 17:06.193
You score one good wave at Pipe Masters...

17:06.234 --> 17:08.194
and you'll get sponsored just like her.

17:08.237 --> 17:10.239
You'll get flown all around the world.

17:10.321 --> 17:13.659
Surf Indo, Australia, Tahiti, you name it.

17:13.784 --> 17:17.788
Surf the world, baby. And you'll get paid
to surf uncrowded, perfect waves.

17:17.829 --> 17:20.374
We'll see you at the contest.
Okay. Thanks a lot.

17:21.666 --> 17:24.670
All you need to do is get noticed.

17:24.837 --> 17:27.214
- Surfer girls.
- Local girls.

17:27.256 --> 17:30.092
You know you're just as good as her.

17:30.092 --> 17:33.095
We gotta go to work, guys.
We're gonna be late, again.

18:09.256 --> 18:11.717
Girls, you're late. I know. Sorry.

18:11.842 --> 18:15.846
-  -

18:15.888 --> 18:19.183
Sorry.

18:24.313 --> 18:28.317
As a reminder, our Pro Bowl
guests are arriving today.

18:28.317 --> 18:33.447
They are V.I.P. returning guests and
deserve the highest level of service.

18:33.572 --> 18:37.493
You must remember we depend on our guests...

18:37.576 --> 18:39.620
for the survival of our business.

19:29.086 --> 19:32.673
It's like this one packed for 
Vegas and landed in Hawaii instead.

19:35.259 --> 19:38.387
- I'm putting it on. -

19:47.980 --> 19:50.691
Guys, guys, it's up, it's up.

19:50.691 --> 19:54.528
Look, Anne Marie Chadwick.
Look at the picture.

19:54.570 --> 19:57.114
Shit. "A wild card entry.

19:57.281 --> 20:02.703
This North Shore local first gained notice
when she dominated in thejunior NSSA. "

20:02.870 --> 20:04.413
You dominated. No.

20:04.538 --> 20:07.416
Wait. You're wearing my bathing suit bottoms.

20:07.541 --> 20:11.003
"She dropped out of the competitive
circuit after a near-drowning incident."

20:11.128 --> 20:14.965
- Yeah, they love bringing that up, huh?
- That was three years ago.

20:15.007 --> 20:17.968
It's over with. You're gonna go pro,
and you're gonna win this thing.

20:18.010 --> 20:20.304
- I want to be on the Internet. Oh, crap!

20:20.304 --> 20:23.182
- Oh, my God.
- Hello? Is somebody in there?

20:23.307 --> 20:25.309
Be there... I'm stuck.

20:25.309 --> 20:27.436
- Put your shoes on.
- Help me, I'm stuck.

20:27.436 --> 20:30.272
- Help me. Ow! Ow!
- Hello? Anyone in there?

20:32.024 --> 20:34.610
- Where's my dress?
- Will you open this door?

20:34.735 --> 20:36.612
- One second. Be right with you.
- Shoes.

20:36.737 --> 20:41.325
Open this door right now.
I'm not fooling around.

20:44.620 --> 20:47.039
- Oh, my shoes.
- Why was this door locked?

20:47.039 --> 20:51.460
I'm sorry. It gets stuck. Maintenance will come up
and look at it any second.

20:51.502 --> 20:54.171
- What's going on in here?
- Just cleaning up.

20:54.213 --> 20:57.341
We're picking up the clothes.
What happened to all the clothes that was on the floor?

20:57.508 --> 21:00.052
We fold them up and put them on the bed.

21:00.219 --> 21:03.472
I left the clothes on the floor so that
you would know they need to be dry-cleaned.

21:03.514 --> 21:08.185
That's actually why we had the
dry-cleaning bags for that specific purpose.

21:08.227 --> 21:10.062
Then why don't you put them in the bag?

21:11.063 --> 21:13.065
No problem. That's a cute top.

21:13.190 --> 21:16.235
Like, I need for you guys to put all
of my crusty clothes inside of the bag.

21:16.360 --> 21:18.487
What about the bags in her boobs?

21:18.529 --> 21:21.532
Her boobs are as big as my head.
And I have one big head.

21:24.243 --> 21:26.370
Excuse us.

21:26.537 --> 21:28.956
Don't mind us.

21:31.083 --> 21:33.377
- Football players.
- Excuse us. - It's all right.

21:38.257 --> 21:40.551
What?

21:58.110 --> 22:00.112
Paddle, paddle, paddle.

22:07.828 --> 22:10.289
Look at that. They're beautiful.

22:13.584 --> 22:15.878
All right, next time, you're paddling.

22:15.961 --> 22:20.007
How about you take a sweet, luscious
run right about now? Oh, yeah, I don't think so.

22:20.132 --> 22:22.551
You can go for it though.

22:22.593 --> 22:24.595
You're the one in training, not me.

22:26.430 --> 22:28.724
Do you smell that?

22:33.020 --> 22:35.022
Beer's gone.

22:35.022 --> 22:37.441
Oh, damn it. Penny?

22:38.609 --> 22:40.903
Pen!

22:40.986 --> 22:43.322
Pen?

22:43.447 --> 22:45.449
Penny?

22:51.622 --> 22:53.916
Frickin' pain in my royal ass! God!

23:35.249 --> 23:39.086
Yeah. Yeah. Stop it. Stop.

23:42.548 --> 23:46.802
Let go. Let go. You too good for us?

24:00.941 --> 24:03.694
Penny. Penny, get up. Get up.
We're going home.

24:03.694 --> 24:05.863
- I'm not going with you.
- It's not a request.

24:05.863 --> 24:07.406
Go away. Leave me alone.

24:07.531 --> 24:09.950
- Get up. Penny, get up.
- Leave me alone.

24:09.992 --> 24:12.578
- Get out of my face.
- I'm not kidding. - Stop.

24:12.703 --> 24:15.164
- Penny!
- Stop! Leave me alone! Get off me!

24:15.247 --> 24:18.292
You're such a bitch! Get off me!

24:19.877 --> 24:22.713
- Why can't you leave me alone?
- 'Cause I'm all you have.

24:22.713 --> 24:25.716
- I'm all you have.
- I don't want you! I don't care!

24:25.883 --> 24:27.718
You're the one who made Mom leave!

24:27.843 --> 24:30.429
You were screwing up all the time!

24:30.554 --> 24:33.307
You know what, fine.

24:33.307 --> 24:36.143
Fine. Chill out.

24:38.604 --> 24:41.607
- We're over this. Turn the music up.
- You all right?

25:00.209 --> 25:02.169
Thanks for the ride.

25:32.241 --> 25:33.367
I shouldjust send her to military school.

25:33.534 --> 25:35.494
Shave her head.
That ought to send a message.

25:35.536 --> 25:38.080
You guys are such hypocrites.
We totally partied at her age.

25:38.080 --> 25:40.666
We did not.
We were not 14. More like 12.

25:40.791 --> 25:43.544
Whose fault is that?
You guys were supposed to be my examples.

25:43.627 --> 25:45.629
What? Oh, please?

25:45.671 --> 25:49.258
Like we forced you during freshman year to climb
the rain gutter at the Volcom house...

25:49.258 --> 25:51.677
and steal their rum. Oh, shit.

25:51.677 --> 25:53.679
I don't remember that.

25:53.679 --> 25:56.265
Don't worry about it.
We turned out fine, right?

25:56.265 --> 25:59.101
Housekeeping. Housekeeping.

26:00.853 --> 26:03.272
Oh, shit! Ohh!

26:03.272 --> 26:05.649
Aw, that reeks. What is that?

26:05.691 --> 26:08.861
What is that smell? I'm not...
I'm not doing this.

26:08.944 --> 26:12.698
- What is that smell?
- Freakin' nasty, that's what it is.

26:12.865 --> 26:14.992
- It reeks in this room.
- This royally sucks.

26:14.992 --> 26:18.162
- Oh, my God.
- All right. Let's just get started.

26:18.245 --> 26:20.873
Oh, sick.!

26:20.998 --> 26:23.292
What? Ohh.!

26:25.002 --> 26:27.713
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! That...

26:27.880 --> 26:31.133
- I'm not cleaning that up.
- We have to do it.

26:31.175 --> 26:34.553
- I'm not cleaning it.
- We got to get it done. - It's so sick.

26:34.595 --> 26:38.432
No-neck pigs. Ohh!
Help me make the bed, Lena.

26:38.432 --> 26:40.601
Football players are so nasty.

26:40.726 --> 26:42.603
I don't even know where to start.

26:42.728 --> 26:45.564
They think they can do anything.
This is ridiculous.

26:45.606 --> 26:47.441
Oh, sick!

26:47.441 --> 26:49.610
- What?
- Get it off, Anne Marie!

26:49.610 --> 26:51.570
It's stuck! It's not coming off!

26:51.612 --> 26:53.614
- What is it?
- It's a condom.

26:53.614 --> 26:56.575
- Grab it! It's stuck!
- No, don't touch it.!

26:57.743 --> 27:00.621
Get it off! Get it off! Get it off.

27:00.746 --> 27:03.165
- Anne Marie, get it off!
- Put some gloves on.

27:03.207 --> 27:05.042
- Oh, get it off!
- Just relax.

27:05.042 --> 27:08.629
I can't get it if you're friggin' tossing around.

27:08.629 --> 27:10.881
Nasty. Oh, my God!

27:10.923 --> 27:13.050
Ohh.!

27:13.050 --> 27:15.052
Oh, sick!

27:15.219 --> 27:17.221
Ohh.!

27:17.221 --> 27:19.890
You know what? That's it.

27:19.932 --> 27:23.060
Ooh, wedding and honeymoon in the same place?

27:23.060 --> 27:27.898
Let's go snorkeling. I am not snorkeling
with this hair. Give me a break.

27:27.940 --> 27:30.526
Those masks leave the worst marks on your face.

27:30.609 --> 27:33.654
There's, like, a hundred people spit in them.

27:33.654 --> 27:35.656
Anybody in room 215?

27:36.657 --> 27:39.076
215? Anybody in 215?

27:39.243 --> 27:42.246
Gentlemen, 2 15?

27:42.246 --> 27:45.249
Anybody in room 215?

27:45.249 --> 27:49.378
No? Anybody in room 215 out in the water?
What?

27:49.378 --> 27:51.922
Suite 215? Is it yours?

27:51.964 --> 27:53.966
Oh.

27:55.384 --> 27:57.970
Ohh! God!

27:59.263 --> 28:00.973
Jump!

28:01.098 --> 28:03.934
I swear to God that's a condom.
I'm in 2 15. I think I won something.

28:03.976 --> 28:06.687
I'm in 215. What'd I win?

28:06.812 --> 28:08.981
Hi. I'm Anne Marie.
I'm the housekeeper of your room.

28:09.106 --> 28:13.277
Leslie. O-line! O-line!

28:13.277 --> 28:16.405
Do you have a sec, Leslie? Sure.
Take all the time you want, sugar-wooger.

28:16.405 --> 28:19.158
Step one.

28:19.283 --> 28:21.952
Step two.

28:23.871 --> 28:27.291
And step three. You got it?

28:27.416 --> 28:29.585
Thanks for your time, guys.

28:29.585 --> 28:32.296
- No problem.
- You got schooled by the maid.

28:32.421 --> 28:34.715
I'm on vacation. You don't have...
You still got schooled.

28:34.715 --> 28:36.717
You don't have to clean your room
when you're on vacation.

28:36.884 --> 28:40.888
You got schooled. But you don't clean
your room when you on vacation!

28:43.015 --> 28:47.019
Am I on vacation?

28:48.604 --> 28:51.190
It was gross, It was disgusting.
I don't care what they did.

28:51.315 --> 28:53.609
They are V.I.P. Pay the highest rate.

28:53.734 --> 28:56.612
They don't pay good Money
to be scolded by a housekeeper.

28:56.612 --> 28:59.907
You can pick up your last check next week.
Surf's up, Anne Marie.

29:00.032 --> 29:02.159
They peed on the floor.
There was puke all over the curtain.

29:02.201 --> 29:04.203
Please don't suspend me.
We need the money.

29:04.203 --> 29:06.330
I'm not suspending you,
I'm firing you.

29:06.497 --> 29:09.208
- What?
- Well, if she's fired, I quit.

29:09.291 --> 29:11.752
Me too. Fine.

29:11.752 --> 29:13.754
You're seriously going to fire all of us?
No.

29:13.879 --> 29:19.343
I'm firing you. They quit. So don't get
any ideas about collecting unemployment.

29:22.304 --> 29:25.057
You guys, don't quit. We need to make rent.

30:04.972 --> 30:07.099
You could have stayed down longer than that.

30:07.224 --> 30:09.685
I'm tired of holding my breath, Eden.

30:14.398 --> 30:17.568
God, shejust loves pissing me off.

30:17.568 --> 30:20.696
Look at her. She's not out here to get waves.
Shejust wants to get attention.

30:20.696 --> 30:23.699
What does she see in those guys?
They're such burnouts.

30:23.699 --> 30:25.242
- Same thing you did.
- What?

30:25.284 --> 30:26.994
Cut body and a nice cutback.

30:28.245 --> 30:31.248
Oh, great. She got a bad attitude.

30:31.290 --> 30:33.292
It's not who she is.

30:46.263 --> 30:50.017
Inside.! Got it.! I'm on it.! Get off!

30:54.146 --> 30:56.899
Hey, beat it.!

30:58.150 --> 31:00.444
Hey, hey, hey.! Got it.!

31:03.155 --> 31:06.617
Hey.! Hey, where you been?

31:06.742 --> 31:09.578
I'm on it.! Get off!

31:12.039 --> 31:15.042
Drew, I got it.!

31:19.046 --> 31:21.048
Hey!

31:42.069 --> 31:46.365
- I had the section. What's your problem?
- You need to grow up.

31:46.532 --> 31:49.660
It's not my fault you broke your board,
you stupid kook. You're a kook.

31:49.660 --> 31:53.205
Don't drop in on me again.
That's right, go home. Beat it.

31:53.247 --> 31:55.249
Donkey.

32:10.848 --> 32:13.559
Can you glue it back together? No.

32:13.684 --> 32:17.855
Yeah, I was just driving by. Okay.

32:17.855 --> 32:20.983
Well, actually, the guy at
the hotel told me where I could find you.

32:22.985 --> 32:25.404
So that was pretty awesome,
you know, surfng.

32:25.404 --> 32:27.406
Right.

32:27.406 --> 32:32.870
Hey, listen. I wanted to apologize
for my friend back at the hotel.

32:32.953 --> 32:36.582
Leslie's kind of messy, but when
your ass is hanging out in the pocket,

32:36.582 --> 32:39.001
he's the guy you want protecting your backside.

32:39.001 --> 32:44.131
So next time your ass is hanging back
in the pocket, he's your guy.

32:44.173 --> 32:46.425
I'll remember that.

32:46.425 --> 32:48.594
- What's up, Anne Marie?
- Hey, Ben.

32:48.594 --> 32:52.014
You broke your board. That sucks.
I bet you were charging.

32:52.014 --> 32:54.433
Something like that.
Hey, don't I know you?

32:54.600 --> 32:57.603
- I don't know, maybe.
- Yeah. You're that quarterback, right?

32:57.728 --> 33:01.023
- Yeah, I play some football.
- That's right, huh?

33:01.023 --> 33:03.442
Nice shoes, bro.

33:04.985 --> 33:10.157
Thanks. I was wondering if, maybe,
you've taught anybody?

33:10.199 --> 33:12.493
Taught anybody? Yeah. How to surf.

33:12.576 --> 33:16.205
No. Well, you know,
I've got some free time.

33:16.330 --> 33:19.917
That's nice. Look, I'd...
I'd love to learn.

33:19.917 --> 33:22.586
It's not easy. I know.
But it looks really fun out there.

33:22.628 --> 33:25.506
- You can get hurt.
- I'm sure I could handle myself.

33:25.631 --> 33:29.927
This guy Rick, he'll set you up with
a spongeboard and some baby waves.

33:30.052 --> 33:32.471
- He's gentle.
- And you are?

33:32.513 --> 33:35.766
Not. Right.

33:35.933 --> 33:39.228
- Check it out.
- Who's GQ jock?

33:39.311 --> 33:41.647
Ho ho ho.

33:45.651 --> 33:48.779
What was that all about? I don't know.
He wanted lessons or something.

33:48.821 --> 33:51.657
Anne Marie! Lessons? Money?
 We're broke? What?

33:51.782 --> 33:55.244
He didn't say anything about paying.
Well, did you ask?

33:55.369 --> 33:58.831
- You guys going tonight? No. What time?
- Go, go, go!

33:59.957 --> 34:02.251
- I don't know. I'm kinda lost.
- Go get him.

34:02.376 --> 34:06.213
Hey! Hey! How much? What? What?

34:06.255 --> 34:09.091
- How much?
- - I got to call you back.

34:09.091 --> 34:10.926
Oh, shit!

34:13.971 --> 34:16.098
Hey! Watch where you're going!

34:20.686 --> 34:23.647
Hurry up! Go get him. Come on.

34:23.688 --> 34:26.817
- Okay, hurry, hurry, hurry.
- Hey. Hey, listen.

34:26.859 --> 34:29.862
- How much?
- I don't know. What's the going rate?

34:32.572 --> 34:35.951
- Twenty bucks an hour.
- Twenty?

34:38.411 --> 34:40.581
Too much?

34:40.706 --> 34:44.126
- Fifteen?
- The hotel charges $150.

34:44.168 --> 34:46.712
I'll pay that.

34:46.837 --> 34:48.880
Whoa! One hundred and fifty bucks.

34:49.005 --> 34:51.007
For surf lessons? That's it, right?

34:51.007 --> 34:54.303
What else are we talking about?
Got any friends?

34:54.303 --> 34:58.015
- Sure I do.
- Whoo! Yeah!

35:07.191 --> 35:09.610
- What's with the face, Pen?
- What face?

35:09.735 --> 35:11.612
Don't worry, honey.
It's just one afternoon.

35:11.737 --> 35:14.281
You'll have time to get pregnant
and go on welfare.

35:14.323 --> 35:16.033
Good idea. It'll be fun.

35:16.033 --> 35:19.036
- We'll play rip off the tourist.
- We're not ripping anyone off.

35:19.036 --> 35:24.041
Anyone who pays $1,000 a night
for a room is just begging to be ripped off.

35:24.208 --> 35:27.628
I saw those guys walk into Tommy Bahama
yesterday and drop four G's on silk boxers.

35:27.753 --> 35:30.172
How is that possible? It's underwear.

35:30.214 --> 35:32.883
Those guys got money to burn.
They play in the NFL.

35:32.925 --> 35:35.928
I don't care about the money.
Anything is better than this.

35:36.053 --> 35:38.180
Oh, my God!

35:38.222 --> 35:40.641
Yeah, right.  Let me out here, you guys.

35:40.766 --> 35:42.768
Penny! Who unloaded the mothership?

35:42.768 --> 35:44.770
I thought his friends would be hot at least.

35:44.937 --> 35:47.189
This is so embarrassing to be seen with you.

35:47.231 --> 35:50.067
You gonna teach us how to surf?
You gonna teach us how to surf?

35:50.192 --> 35:52.236
Guys.

35:52.361 --> 35:54.488
Busted.

35:54.530 --> 35:57.366
- Come on, it's 150 each.
- What if we see people we know? God.

35:57.366 --> 35:59.493
Whatever. It's surf lessons.
This is what jocks look like?

35:59.535 --> 36:02.371
- A hundred and fifty bucks.
- Let's go surfing, big daddy.

36:02.371 --> 36:04.832
What's up, girls?

36:08.252 --> 36:11.255
This is Lena and Eden. I'm Anne Marie.

36:11.255 --> 36:13.966
- Hey.
- We gonna surf today?

36:14.091 --> 36:16.385
Watch out. I'll make sure you drown out there.

36:16.385 --> 36:19.388
How's it going? Matt. Nice to meet you.

36:19.555 --> 36:22.683
- This is my little sister, Penny.
- What's up, little mama?

36:22.683 --> 36:26.687
Little surf baby. 
You're gonna surf in that?

36:26.854 --> 36:30.691
- Hell, no. I'm gonna surf in my da-da-da-da's.
- In your what?

36:30.816 --> 36:34.403
My da-da-da-da's!

36:34.528 --> 36:37.990
- Da-da-da-da! -

36:38.115 --> 36:40.284
You're wearing nut huggers.

36:40.409 --> 36:43.704
Some might call them that. I call them
nut containers. You're gonna teach me to surf.

36:43.829 --> 36:46.290
One, two, three.

36:46.415 --> 36:48.292
Snap up!

36:51.003 --> 36:54.965
- No duck butt.
- Oh. Oh, yeah.

37:08.437 --> 37:10.147
- -

37:17.613 --> 37:19.740
- -

37:19.907 --> 37:21.325
- -

37:21.492 --> 37:23.035
- -

37:23.202 --> 37:24.912
- -

37:52.898 --> 37:55.526
- Ohh! -

38:02.241 --> 38:07.204
Are you ready? All right.
Start paddling! Paddle! Go! Go!

38:07.246 --> 38:11.250
Yeah.! Yes.! Get up.! Get up.! Get up.!

38:11.250 --> 38:14.545
Put your head in the center!
Lean forward! Hula hands!

38:14.628 --> 38:18.674
- Come on! Go!
- Whoa! Ohh!

38:18.674 --> 38:20.551
- -

38:20.634 --> 38:22.845
- -

38:22.928 --> 38:27.683
Come on, get back out here!
One more time!

38:27.808 --> 38:29.852
Hey, I'm giving a lesson.

38:35.691 --> 38:39.153
There you go. Come on.
Paddle! Paddle!

38:39.236 --> 38:41.572
- 
- Whoo!

38:41.572 --> 38:43.991
Whoo!

38:45.159 --> 38:47.411
That was so good.

38:47.411 --> 38:50.247
That was so good.

38:50.289 --> 38:54.126
That was incredible. Whoa!

38:54.168 --> 38:56.420
Are you psyched? Yeah, totally.

38:56.420 --> 38:58.297
Let's go out and catch
one of those big ones.

38:58.422 --> 39:02.593
- Out there? Well, sure you can handle it?
- Yeah. Definitely.

39:08.307 --> 39:12.019
Come on, Matt. You got it.
You got it. Paddle, paddle, paddle.!

39:12.019 --> 39:15.314
Harder. Come on. You got to dig.

39:15.439 --> 39:17.608
All right, Anne Marie,
I'm right there with you.

39:17.733 --> 39:21.320
Don't worry about me. I got this mastered.

39:21.487 --> 39:24.323
I am a football player. Oh, shit.!

39:24.448 --> 39:26.909
Ohh!

39:30.621 --> 39:32.748
A couple more, you've got it.
Just a couple more waves.

39:38.629 --> 39:43.509
Dig.! Turtle.! Get under your board.!
Turn it over.!

39:50.182 --> 39:53.936
-
- Don't give up. Come on. Paddle.

39:56.522 --> 39:59.942
Got to make it over this wave.
Here we go. Paddle, paddle. Hey! Hey!

40:00.067 --> 40:01.944
Get out of the way.! Harder!
There you go.

40:08.826 --> 40:11.078
You okay? Oh, man, that was intense.

40:11.078 --> 40:13.664
It's getting big out here.
Sure you don't want to go in?

40:13.664 --> 40:16.250
No. I mean, are we safe out here?

40:16.375 --> 40:19.962
That depends what you think is safe,
but, yeah, pretty much. Oh, man.

40:24.675 --> 40:27.678
How about this one here?
No, this one's not a wave.

40:27.803 --> 40:31.682
Oh, almost. We'll get you one,
Matt, I promise. Come on back.

40:31.682 --> 40:34.977
Oh, man. Just be patient, Matt.
We'll get you one.

40:35.102 --> 40:38.564
Anne Marie, we're leaving!

40:38.689 --> 40:43.235
Hey, sweetie, why don't you
come over here and help me out a little bit?

40:43.277 --> 40:45.696
Gonna need two of us to carry this thing.

40:45.696 --> 40:48.574
We should go. It's getting late.
I'm not leaving until I catch one.

40:48.699 --> 40:51.285
- How about this one?
- Turn around, quick. Quick.
Eggbeat. Eggbeat.

40:54.288 --> 40:56.415
There you go, Matt. This is it.

40:56.415 --> 40:59.543
Paddling. Start paddling. Go!
Paddle! Paddle!

41:02.421 --> 41:04.590
Stand up. Stand up.

41:07.009 --> 41:10.304
Whoo-hoo! Whoo! Yeah! Yeah!

41:13.015 --> 41:15.851
There you go.! Yeah.!

41:15.893 --> 41:18.145
- Whoo.!
- Yeah!

41:21.440 --> 41:24.902
- Yes!
- There you go.! Goodjob, Matt.!

41:24.902 --> 41:26.904
-
- Yeah.

41:26.904 --> 41:29.323
- Good job.
- Yes!

41:33.744 --> 41:36.497
Hi. Welcome to the Lanakai.
That's all right. I'm just dropping him off.

41:36.622 --> 41:39.458
Why don't you come in for a drink?

41:39.500 --> 41:43.879
Um, yeah. No, I'd love to, but l, um...
But what?

41:45.923 --> 41:48.759
I have to get back to my side of the island.
You know what I mean?

41:48.759 --> 41:52.346
Uh, no. Why? 'Cause I'm in training.

41:52.471 --> 41:55.891
Pipe, uh, line. Pipeline.

41:55.933 --> 41:58.227
Master. Pipe Masters. Right.
Pipe Masters. Right.

41:59.895 --> 42:03.607
Well, uh, I tell you what. Uh...

42:04.650 --> 42:06.777
I've only got 40 bucks. For what?

42:06.819 --> 42:10.239
For you. For the lesson.

42:10.364 --> 42:12.533
Oh, right. But if you want
to come up to my room,

42:12.658 --> 42:15.619
I'll give you the rest of it, the money.

42:18.372 --> 42:22.376
l-I would really like to do that,
but see those guys over there?

42:22.376 --> 42:23.961
They see us heading up to your room,

42:23.961 --> 42:26.630
half the island's gonna have us
sleeping together by tomorrow.

42:26.672 --> 42:28.674
Really? It's the coconut wireless.

42:28.674 --> 42:31.218
That's very serious. It's great. Yeah.

42:31.260 --> 42:34.805
In that case, you wait here,
I'll come right back with your money.

42:34.847 --> 42:36.849
All right. Well, wait.

42:39.101 --> 42:42.396
I'll come up. You sure?

42:42.521 --> 42:44.982
Okay. I don't want to ruin
your reputation or anything.

42:45.107 --> 42:47.151
Thanks. I'll worry about that.

42:47.234 --> 42:51.113
All right. Okay. You go up the elevator,
I'll go up the back way.

42:51.155 --> 42:54.992
It's so sneaky. It's likeJames Bond.
Just shut up.

43:12.301 --> 43:14.303
Excuse me.

43:38.452 --> 43:41.622
- -

43:41.747 --> 43:44.291
- What the hell is she doing? -

43:44.333 --> 43:47.628
- Hey. Where you going?
- Hey.

43:47.753 --> 43:51.048
I just... I didn't... I didn't know
if that was your room or not.

43:51.048 --> 43:53.467
It's my room. Yeah.

43:53.509 --> 43:55.511
Come in. Okay. Thanks.

43:58.222 --> 44:01.225
Oh.

44:01.225 --> 44:05.354
- Looks different at night.
- Yeah. It's pretty nice.

44:08.607 --> 44:10.943
I'm gonna... I'm just gonna go... 
Yeah. It's right there.

44:10.943 --> 44:13.070
Yeah, I know where it is. Thanks.

44:41.557 --> 44:43.392
What are you doing?

44:43.559 --> 44:47.688
Uh, I'm just trying to find the Money
that I hid.

44:47.813 --> 44:50.399
- What, from the maid?
- Yeah, right.

44:51.817 --> 44:53.986
Uh, let's see.

44:53.986 --> 44:57.865
- One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine...
- Whoa, wait.

44:57.990 --> 45:02.578
That's... That's way, way just...
That's... That's a $1,000.

45:02.578 --> 45:05.414
I'll be here a week. That's $150 a day.

45:05.539 --> 45:10.127
So I gave myself a $50
discount for paying up front.

45:10.169 --> 45:12.588
Are you trying to buy me? No.

45:12.713 --> 45:15.716
No. I just don't want to lose you.

45:30.189 --> 45:33.484
Can I ask you a really weird question?

45:33.484 --> 45:36.320
Yeah. Are you wearing my cologne?

45:38.030 --> 45:40.032
Yes. Uh-huh.

45:41.033 --> 45:43.577
It, uh, it smells good on you.

45:50.918 --> 45:54.338
You should probably get that.
Yeah. Right.

45:55.339 --> 45:57.925
Hey, you.

45:59.927 --> 46:02.638
Yeah? Hey. Hey, sweetheart.

46:02.638 --> 46:05.307
Are you feeling better?
Yeah, I know.

46:05.349 --> 46:08.060
I tried to call earlier, but, uh,
no one was there.

46:08.185 --> 46:11.480
Yeah, I miss you too. I miss you too.

46:11.522 --> 46:13.649
It's been hectic. Matt, I'm gonna...

46:15.067 --> 46:18.070
Listen, let me call you back, all right?
All right.

46:19.655 --> 46:23.075
I love you too. All right, bye-bye.

46:23.200 --> 46:28.205
- Sorry.
- Guess that's why they have
that no fraternization rule.

46:28.247 --> 46:30.499
What do you mean?

46:30.541 --> 46:32.543
Management gets call from irate wife...

46:32.543 --> 46:35.546
wondering why maid is in
husband's room at 2:00 in the morning.

46:35.546 --> 46:39.383
That's not my wife.
Wife, girlfriend, boyfriend.

46:39.383 --> 46:41.802
No, really. It's not my wife.
Look, it's my niece.

46:41.844 --> 46:46.098
Actually, my... my sister's daughter,
Rebecca. There she is.

46:47.558 --> 46:49.393
So.

46:49.560 --> 46:51.562
I swear.

46:53.564 --> 46:55.983
She's beautiful. Yeah, she is.
She's a sweetheart.

46:56.150 --> 47:00.279
Sorry about that. It's just, uh, kinda
strange with the time difference.

47:00.404 --> 47:02.698
I should probably go.
It's getting late.

47:02.823 --> 47:06.118
All right.
Do we have a surf lesson tomorrow?

47:06.160 --> 47:08.996
Definitely. All right.

47:09.121 --> 47:11.248
Okay.

47:13.000 --> 47:15.419
Bye. Bye.

47:16.420 --> 47:18.005
Bye.

47:45.032 --> 47:47.326
I thought you were just giving him lessons.

47:47.451 --> 47:49.453
I did. Huh. Yeah, in what?

47:49.495 --> 47:51.497
Penny didn't finish her homework.

47:51.497 --> 47:54.458
- You weren't here to help me.
- She's got to do her homework.

47:54.500 --> 47:56.585
Don't give us shit 'cause
you were out there working it.

47:56.627 --> 47:59.296
Shut up. Don't deny it.

47:59.338 --> 48:04.885
You were working it like a rib
without sauce. Shut up... Ow!

48:04.927 --> 48:07.304
Well, what happened?
Oh, my God. Nothing.

48:07.346 --> 48:09.515
Oh, sure. Tell me what happened.

48:09.640 --> 48:11.767
No. Did you get some play? Huh?

48:11.767 --> 48:15.604
- Did you? Did you?
- We kissed for two seconds. It wasn't a big deal.

48:15.646 --> 48:18.232
I'm sure you did.
How much am I supposed to buy that for?

48:18.357 --> 48:20.609
What do you take me for? I don't know.

48:20.651 --> 48:22.945
Seriously. What else? Come on.

48:22.945 --> 48:24.947
Here, this will pay the bills.

48:26.657 --> 48:29.243
There's, like, $1,000 here.
I feel like your pimp.

48:29.368 --> 48:33.205
You must know how to kiss.
Or you must know how to do something else.

48:33.247 --> 48:36.083
Good night, Penny. You're going to bed now.

48:41.380 --> 48:43.382
Hey. What's up?

48:47.678 --> 48:52.558
Look, I hate to be the buzzkill here,
but the contest is in a week.

48:52.558 --> 48:55.102
And I just don't think that it's time for...

48:55.102 --> 48:58.814
I know. But I did promise him
another lesson tomorrow.

48:59.940 --> 49:03.277
- Can't you just blow him off?
- No.

49:03.402 --> 49:05.571
- Why not?
- Because he already paid me.

49:05.696 --> 49:08.282
Exactly. Eden.

49:09.700 --> 49:11.869
I wanted to rent a jet ski tomorrow.

49:11.952 --> 49:14.997
Put you into some size.
Get you ready for Pipe.

49:15.122 --> 49:18.584
I'll meet you at the launch at 4:00.
Why not earlier?

49:19.710 --> 49:22.296
I'll meet you there as soon as I can.

49:25.299 --> 49:29.595
- Where we going again?
- A little spot the hotel does not tell the tourists about.

49:37.311 --> 49:41.023
Oh, my God. You drive like you surf.
I drive like I wished I surfed.

49:45.569 --> 49:49.490
Wow. This is beautiful. Yeah.
I used to come here when I was a kid.

49:49.615 --> 49:54.036
I've been dreaming about surfing all night.
Aw, Minnesota's got surf stoke.

49:58.332 --> 50:02.628
- -

50:03.921 --> 50:06.757
-
- Watch out.

50:14.306 --> 50:17.935
Yeah.

50:31.073 --> 50:35.077
Whoo-hoo!

50:38.247 --> 50:40.249
How many sisters you got, Minnesota?

50:40.249 --> 50:42.668
Uh, five. Five?

50:42.668 --> 50:45.254
Five. Really? You're the only boy?

50:45.254 --> 50:48.966
Uh, yep. Explains what?
Well, that explains it then.

50:49.091 --> 50:52.261
That's why you're not intimidated by women. 
Yeah.

50:52.261 --> 50:54.263
Why is that funny?

50:54.263 --> 50:57.099
Because I'm scared shitless of women.

50:57.099 --> 51:01.854
My sisters would beat me on a regular basis.
See, look.

51:01.979 --> 51:04.273
See how I can't extend my finger?
Yes.

51:04.273 --> 51:07.276
Because my sister
Dana broke it when I was eight...

51:07.401 --> 51:09.278
just because I wouldn't get out of her room.

51:09.278 --> 51:11.238
Because it's broken that way,

51:11.280 --> 51:14.992
when I throw the football,
it gives it a nice little zip.

51:15.159 --> 51:17.286
A nice little touch? Exactly.

51:17.411 --> 51:21.874
Uh, I think we got company.

51:24.293 --> 51:27.588
Oh, great. Yeah, I do. We gotta go.
You know those guys?

51:27.588 --> 51:30.841
Really? Yeah. Prepare to get vibed.

51:30.883 --> 51:34.887
This place is kapu.
That means off-limits to you, haole.

51:41.602 --> 51:43.562
What's up, guys? This is a local spot.

51:43.604 --> 51:45.481
Yeah, and I'm a local. He's not.

51:45.564 --> 51:47.483
What's up, haole boy? Drew, back off.

51:47.566 --> 51:49.610
We grew here, you flew here.
It's not his fault.

51:49.735 --> 51:52.196
What are you doing on our beach,
haole boy?

51:52.321 --> 51:54.156
You don't live here, you don't surf here.

51:54.198 --> 51:56.325
We'll be out ofhere in five seconds.
This is a local spot.

51:56.450 --> 51:59.745
- This place is for the boys.
- You know not to bring this guy here.

51:59.912 --> 52:03.499
Why don't you relax, bro? Bro? You telling me bro?

52:03.582 --> 52:08.170
-	Drew, stop it. - You want some of this?
-	Don't even touch me.

52:08.212 --> 52:09.922
- Don't touch her.
- What are you gonna do?

52:10.047 --> 52:12.341
I've got his wallet. We're out of here. Let's go surf.

52:12.341 --> 52:15.636
- Drew, stop!
- Linemen aren't here to protect you, haole boy.

52:15.761 --> 52:18.347
Walk away. Stop it.
Why are you being like this?

52:18.472 --> 52:21.475
Don't touch her. 
What are you gonna do?

52:34.613 --> 52:38.534
Drew! Both of you! That's enough! Stop!

52:38.617 --> 52:42.079
Get off! Get in the car!
Stop it! Get in the car!

52:42.204 --> 52:44.832
Stop it. Get in the car.
Get in the car.

52:44.957 --> 52:46.959
Walk away. You're an asshole.

52:47.084 --> 52:49.253
I do what I do best.

52:49.253 --> 52:52.631
Relax, bro. You kicked his ass.
You kicked his ass.

52:52.673 --> 52:55.968
You stupid monkey.
Go back to the mainland.

53:05.269 --> 53:07.271
This is bullshit.

53:07.396 --> 53:09.815
Kawela's?

53:09.857 --> 53:12.276
And you expected to make it back in time?

53:12.276 --> 53:16.405
I rented a jet ski. I know. I'm sorry.
I said I was sorry a hundred times.

53:16.405 --> 53:18.115
Whatever. She's good, man.

53:18.157 --> 53:21.160
Hello?

53:21.243 --> 53:23.412
What'd she say?

53:23.412 --> 53:25.414
She's messin' up, man.

53:27.583 --> 53:30.169
Ah.

53:41.847 --> 53:45.976
Everything okay? Oh, yeah.
We'll be okay.

53:46.018 --> 53:48.729
I can see why the tourists
here never leave their hotels.

53:48.854 --> 53:51.857
Oh, don't say that.
That's not real Hawaii.

53:51.899 --> 53:54.610
They're just... They're just crazy.

53:54.610 --> 53:58.906
They're so protective of their
land and their waves, especially.

53:59.031 --> 54:01.492
And their women?

54:03.202 --> 54:05.204
What?

54:05.287 --> 54:07.498
I'm glad I'm here.

54:31.939 --> 54:33.941
Whoo!

54:45.369 --> 54:47.371
I have to go to practice. I'll get up.

54:47.371 --> 54:49.373
No, no, no. Sleep in.

54:49.498 --> 54:52.084
Are you sure? Yeah. You can sleep.

54:52.084 --> 54:54.086
Bye. Bye.

54:58.674 --> 55:01.093
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

55:15.691 --> 55:17.985
Hello? Lena, it's me.

55:18.110 --> 55:21.572
- Hey. Where are you?
- Don't worry about it.

55:21.572 --> 55:25.284
- You're at his room, huh?
- It's none of your business.

55:25.409 --> 55:28.287
I just wanna make sure
Penny gets to school okay. Yeah, yeah.

55:28.287 --> 55:30.164
Don't worry about it. What happened?

55:30.289 --> 55:33.250
- I will tell you everything.
- Come on, little hooch.

55:33.292 --> 55:36.962
- Oh, my God. -

55:37.004 --> 55:39.298
- All right. - Bye.

56:19.505 --> 56:22.758
- Room Service. Can I help you?
- I'd like to order breakfast.

56:22.758 --> 56:25.052
Of course, Mrs. Tollman.
What can I get you?

56:25.052 --> 56:27.930
Uh, the blueberry waffles.

56:46.949 --> 56:48.951
Housekeeping.

56:51.370 --> 56:54.832
Well, aloha. Look at you,
little miss princess.

56:54.915 --> 56:57.084
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

56:57.209 --> 56:59.086
So the glass slipper fit, huh?

56:59.253 --> 57:01.255
I even went in the pool. Shut up!

57:01.380 --> 57:04.258
You're so irritating.
Was it my fault he abducted me...

57:04.258 --> 57:06.260
and forced me to eat blueberry waffles?

57:06.385 --> 57:08.846
Blueberry waffles? Where?
Nice. Outside.

57:18.272 --> 57:20.691
What are you doing? Helping.

57:20.691 --> 57:24.528
Why? You're not a maid anymore.
Don't be mad at me.

57:24.570 --> 57:26.405
I'm not mad.  Mmm.!

57:26.572 --> 57:30.993
These are so good.
You didn't save me any whipped cream though.

57:31.160 --> 57:35.414
Some guy thinks you look hot in a bikini,
and you forget all about the contest.

57:35.581 --> 57:37.875
That's not fair, and you know it.

57:37.875 --> 57:40.002
Champagne? How cheesy are you?

57:40.169 --> 57:43.172
Shut up. I'm not mad.

57:43.255 --> 57:48.177
It's just... I happen to know
that you kick ass out there,

57:48.302 --> 57:51.263
and you worked very hard
to get to where you are.

57:51.305 --> 57:55.601
I know. Pipe is in three days.

57:55.601 --> 57:59.313
Every single sponsor is here,

57:59.438 --> 58:01.899
and it's just you and one other girl out there.

58:01.899 --> 58:03.734
I know. I got it. Okay?

58:03.734 --> 58:07.029
People would kill to be in your shoes.
I got it!

58:09.740 --> 58:13.202
Hey, listen to me.
Contest comes first.

58:13.285 --> 58:15.287
Nothing changes that.

58:53.367 --> 58:55.953
I'm gonna whip it around.

59:48.547 --> 59:50.549
Whoo!

01:00:10.736 --> 01:00:13.322
This is it. This is it, right there.

01:00:41.642 --> 01:00:43.185
Yeah!

01:00:53.529 --> 01:00:54.905
Shit.

01:01:06.083 --> 01:01:09.253
Anne Marie! Hey, Anne!

01:01:11.380 --> 01:01:13.924
Anne Marie.!

01:01:25.686 --> 01:01:28.230
Eden, I'm over here.!

01:01:32.276 --> 01:01:35.571
Get on. Get on.
We gotta get outta here.

01:01:35.571 --> 01:01:39.992
I got you. I got you. Hold on.

01:01:40.159 --> 01:01:42.119
What's wrong?

01:01:42.161 --> 01:01:44.580
- Eden, get outta here! - Oh, shit!

01:01:46.290 --> 01:01:48.417
Bail.! Bail.!

01:02:35.172 --> 01:02:37.758
You all right? Where were you?

01:02:37.925 --> 01:02:39.885
I was right behind you.
I couldn't get in without getting crushed.

01:02:39.927 --> 01:02:42.638
You whipped me in way too deep.
You need to kick out earlier.

01:02:42.638 --> 01:02:44.765
Okay, are we done with our excuses now?
I wanna go in.

01:02:44.890 --> 01:02:48.227
We'll rest for a minute. I don't wanna get
some rest. I almost died out there.

01:02:48.227 --> 01:02:51.355
You did not almost die.
You were under for, like, five seconds.

01:02:51.355 --> 01:02:54.942
Stop being such a Barbie.
What did you say to me? What?

01:02:55.067 --> 01:02:59.071
A Barbie? What is your problem?

01:02:59.238 --> 01:03:03.534
All I'm saying is that if you can't handle this,

01:03:03.617 --> 01:03:06.078
there's no way you're gonna be
ready for the Pipe Masters.

01:03:06.245 --> 01:03:08.664
Then you go. If you're so friggin'
ballsy, Eden, you go.

01:03:08.664 --> 01:03:10.666
I can't. I wasn't invited.

01:03:12.668 --> 01:03:14.670
I don't know
what the hell you want from me.

01:03:14.670 --> 01:03:17.673
What I want from you is to get your own life
and stop living through me.

01:03:17.798 --> 01:03:20.259
Get your own dreams.

01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:27.391
So that's it.
You're gonna run off and be a pro ho, huh?

01:03:27.516 --> 01:03:30.394
At least I have someone
that's interested in me.

01:03:40.112 --> 01:03:42.406
Why does this seem so familiar, huh?

01:03:42.573 --> 01:03:44.575
Run away when things get tough.

01:03:44.700 --> 01:03:47.578
I'm stressed out. I think
I'm gonna ditch my kid... Shut up!

01:03:47.578 --> 01:03:51.415
and run away with some guy I met in California.
Shut up! I'm not kidding!

01:03:51.540 --> 01:03:53.542
Sounds a little bit too familiar.

01:03:53.584 --> 01:03:55.878
Leave me alone.!
Like mother, like daughter.

01:03:55.961 --> 01:03:58.297
- Shut up! - You're just gonna quit?

01:03:58.297 --> 01:04:00.883
Get outta my face.
You're gonna prove these guys right?

01:04:00.966 --> 01:04:04.428
Assholes who think that you can't surf
Pipe because you don't have the balls.

01:04:04.553 --> 01:04:06.597
I guess so then, 'cause I quit.

01:04:06.722 --> 01:04:08.724
I quit!

01:04:10.309 --> 01:04:12.436
You're not a quitter. You're just scared.

01:04:19.485 --> 01:04:22.738
Hey. Oh, my God. What's wrong?

01:04:26.617 --> 01:04:29.912
Are you okay? No.

01:04:30.037 --> 01:04:33.749
Yeah, Rochelle Ballard rips.

01:04:33.916 --> 01:04:35.918
Oh! Closeout!

01:04:36.043 --> 01:04:38.921
Wiped out.  Sorry, Rochelle.

01:04:39.046 --> 01:04:43.050
Where's Anne Marie?
Who cares? Let me play.

01:04:43.217 --> 01:04:46.762
Hey, it's my turn. You got beat.

01:04:48.639 --> 01:04:50.766
It's hump day... Wednesday.

01:04:50.808 --> 01:04:52.810
We've got that high-surf advisory in effect...

01:04:52.893 --> 01:04:55.646
for the north-and northwest-facing shores.

01:05:02.528 --> 01:05:06.240
Sounds a little bit too familiar.
Like mother, like daughter.

01:05:11.537 --> 01:05:14.081
This is your dream.
This is what you were born to do.

01:05:17.376 --> 01:05:21.255
- Don't throw it away on this guy.
- Eden.!

01:05:27.094 --> 01:05:29.972
You're not a quitter.
You'rejust scared.

01:05:29.972 --> 01:05:33.517
I'm gonna be the best surfer in the world.

01:05:33.559 --> 01:05:37.271
And it's just you and one other girl out there.

01:05:37.271 --> 01:05:40.858
It's just you and one other girl out there.

01:06:05.841 --> 01:06:07.551
Shit!

01:06:07.593 --> 01:06:10.429
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

01:06:10.554 --> 01:06:12.723
Wow. You look... What?

01:06:12.848 --> 01:06:14.892
Where'd you get that? What?

01:06:14.892 --> 01:06:17.311
- The dress.
- From a store.

01:06:17.436 --> 01:06:20.731
- He bought it?
- Yes, he bought it. So what?

01:06:20.731 --> 01:06:23.275
So I can see your boobs. Great.

01:06:23.317 --> 01:06:26.278
I think she looks beautiful. Thank you.

01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:29.031
- She looks the way he wants her to look.
- Like Baywatch Barbie.

01:06:29.156 --> 01:06:31.325
- Penny, shut up.
- Is he gonna buy you implants too?

01:06:31.492 --> 01:06:33.619
Penny, I just can't do this right now, okay?

01:06:33.744 --> 01:06:35.746
Man, that girl could rip.

01:06:39.166 --> 01:06:41.210
Who is that? You.

01:06:41.335 --> 01:06:46.340
That was the first time you beat me
at the Menehune contest in Haliewa.

01:06:46.507 --> 01:06:50.052
You were such a cocky little shit.

01:06:50.052 --> 01:06:54.473
Always talking all that trash
and how you would be number one.

01:06:54.515 --> 01:06:57.768
I was so pissed at you 'cause
I knew you would be.

01:06:57.810 --> 01:07:00.938
All talented and shit.

01:07:00.938 --> 01:07:03.774
The boys were spinnin'. Remember that?

01:07:03.816 --> 01:07:07.653
They had to throw up some bullshit
rule barring you from the boys' contest.

01:07:11.490 --> 01:07:13.492
I'm gonna be late.

01:07:13.534 --> 01:07:17.663
He's leaving in a few days with a tan,
and what are you gonna be left with,

01:07:17.663 --> 01:07:19.790
a pair of shoes?

01:07:32.511 --> 01:07:34.388
I wanted platinum.

01:07:34.555 --> 01:07:36.557
At least it's an "E." It is?

01:07:36.682 --> 01:07:38.684
It'd better be. He said it was.

01:07:38.851 --> 01:07:40.811
1½ "E."

01:07:40.853 --> 01:07:43.689
Everybody think I'm sexy.
I'm the sexiest... You ain't sexy.

01:07:43.814 --> 01:07:46.275
He don't know anything.

01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:47.943
Very Tiffany's.

01:07:47.985 --> 01:07:50.571
He likes your little sum-sum.

01:07:50.696 --> 01:07:54.992
A little lovin' one night.
And then you get yourself a little upgrade.

01:07:55.117 --> 01:07:57.119
That's good enough.

01:08:00.289 --> 01:08:02.291
Good evening, miss.
Welcome to the Lanakai.

01:08:02.291 --> 01:08:04.293
Jimmy, are you kidding me?
It's me. It's Anne Marie.

01:08:04.418 --> 01:08:06.420
Holy shit! You look insane.

01:08:06.545 --> 01:08:08.714
Thank you. God. All right.

01:08:16.305 --> 01:08:19.725
Wow. You look...

01:08:19.725 --> 01:08:22.310
Weird. No. Gorgeous.

01:08:22.310 --> 01:08:24.313
Really?

01:08:25.731 --> 01:08:28.734
Let's go show you off. Oh!

01:08:33.488 --> 01:08:36.908
This is great. This is great.

01:08:40.203 --> 01:08:42.206
Okay.

01:08:42.331 --> 01:08:45.751
Now it's time for a few of you lucky
men to learn how to do the Tahitian hula.

01:08:45.751 --> 01:08:48.337
- Do we have any volunteers? -

01:08:48.462 --> 01:08:52.216
Some intelligent men.
Some men of size.

01:08:52.299 --> 01:08:54.635
Here I go.

01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:58.596
- All right. Wish me luck.
- Come on. Let's push it up.

01:08:58.639 --> 01:09:01.350
Get those hands up in the air.

01:09:01.475 --> 01:09:05.187
Rip it! Rip it!

01:09:09.608 --> 01:09:12.069
Come on. Let's go. Everybody.

01:09:20.661 --> 01:09:24.247
Throw your hands in the air!

01:09:52.568 --> 01:09:54.695
Hey, howzit, wave riders!

01:09:54.820 --> 01:09:57.281
We got that high-surf advisory posted again.

01:09:57.281 --> 01:10:00.284
Right now, it's a macking 15 to 20 feet.

01:10:00.409 --> 01:10:05.831
Out in Pipeline tomorrow,
the girls have the place all to themselves.

01:10:05.873 --> 01:10:08.542
What are we supposed
to talk about with her anyways?

01:10:08.584 --> 01:10:10.711
Windex, I guess. Or Comet.

01:10:10.836 --> 01:10:13.297
The only person who knows anything
about Windex or Comet in our house...

01:10:13.422 --> 01:10:15.424
is Carmen, but not me.

01:10:15.591 --> 01:10:19.303
I hope she doesn't think he's gonna marry her.

01:10:19.428 --> 01:10:22.181
Of course she does. Prince Charming
come to save her from the toilets.

01:10:22.264 --> 01:10:24.266
And get some of that ten million a year.

01:10:24.308 --> 01:10:27.895
Oh, God. Matt and the maid.

01:10:28.020 --> 01:10:32.024
Oh, my God. Did you guys
check out that dress? Hello?

01:10:32.149 --> 01:10:34.610
Where does she think she's going
anyway, the prom?

01:10:34.735 --> 01:10:37.196
I thought her shoes were totally cute.

01:10:37.321 --> 01:10:39.323
Trust me on this. He made her up.

01:10:39.323 --> 01:10:43.160
The whole Matt Tollman makeover.
Did you see the shoes, the dress, the bracelet?

01:10:43.202 --> 01:10:47.206
His classic line.

01:10:47.289 --> 01:10:50.209
Oh, my God.
Do you guys remember the Denny's waitress?

01:10:50.209 --> 01:10:54.922
Oh, that's right.
I knew she looked familiar.

01:10:55.047 --> 01:10:58.509
Matt loves to slum.
That's just how he is.

01:10:58.509 --> 01:11:03.180
Come on. That's his style.
He likes those cheap little...

01:11:03.222 --> 01:11:07.184
Cheap Barbie... 
Here. They're all yours.

01:11:10.646 --> 01:11:14.358
Oh, my God. Oh.
My God. Was that just her?

01:11:14.525 --> 01:11:16.527
Oh, it was. She was here.

01:11:16.652 --> 01:11:20.072
Our dancer tonight is Chief...
What's your name?

01:11:20.239 --> 01:11:22.491
Leslie, but everybody
call me "Poon Daddy."

01:11:22.533 --> 01:11:24.660
Aloha, Chief Poon Daddy!

01:11:24.785 --> 01:11:26.954
Oh, yeah.!

01:11:27.079 --> 01:11:29.206
Ow.! Baby, go.!

01:11:29.248 --> 01:11:32.376
Come on.! Shake your thing.!

01:11:32.376 --> 01:11:34.378
Let's hear it for this guy.
Isn't he great?

01:11:34.545 --> 01:11:36.922
You got milk in those coconuts?

01:11:36.964 --> 01:11:39.091
Shake it, shake it, shake it.!

01:11:39.091 --> 01:11:42.845
Oh, yeah.! Oh, yeah.!

01:11:42.928 --> 01:11:45.556
Anne Marie. Where you goin'?

01:11:45.556 --> 01:11:48.934
Anne Marie? Stop?

01:11:50.978 --> 01:11:53.230
What the... Oh, man.

01:11:53.272 --> 01:11:56.400
Uh, Anne Marie, uh...

01:12:04.533 --> 01:12:06.243
Anne Marie.

01:12:10.873 --> 01:12:14.585
Anne Marie.
What the hell are you doin'?

01:12:14.585 --> 01:12:16.712
I don't know, Matt.
What am I doing?

01:12:18.422 --> 01:12:22.843
The other day, when
I was ordering room service,

01:12:22.885 --> 01:12:26.430
the guy on the phone called me
Mrs. Tollman, and I didn't correct him.

01:12:26.472 --> 01:12:28.891
'Cause for a minute,

01:12:29.016 --> 01:12:31.018
I liked the way it sounded.

01:12:33.187 --> 01:12:36.732
And I was just wondering if the
Denny's waitress felt the same way.

01:12:36.732 --> 01:12:39.026
Listen...

01:12:39.193 --> 01:12:41.195
You know what? I'm fine, okay.

01:12:41.278 --> 01:12:43.906
I know what I am, and I'm fine with it.

01:12:44.031 --> 01:12:46.742
What? Who are you?

01:12:46.742 --> 01:12:51.038
I'm the maid that you slept with on vacation.

01:12:51.163 --> 01:12:54.917
I'm the great story you tell when
someone asks you how you learned to surf.

01:12:58.504 --> 01:13:00.506
You don't trust anybody, do you?

01:13:00.589 --> 01:13:02.925
Can I? Can I trust you?

01:13:03.050 --> 01:13:05.928
To do what?

01:13:05.928 --> 01:13:07.805
I mean...

01:13:09.223 --> 01:13:11.225
What do you want?

01:13:11.350 --> 01:13:14.603
What do I want? Oh, my God.

01:13:17.898 --> 01:13:20.526
I want...

01:13:20.651 --> 01:13:24.238
Penny to quit smoking and to go to college.

01:13:24.363 --> 01:13:27.950
I want... I want to be able
to pay the phone and the electricity...

01:13:28.075 --> 01:13:30.828
and the rent all in the same month.

01:13:30.953 --> 01:13:33.622
I want a girl to be on the cover
of Surf magazine,

01:13:33.664 --> 01:13:36.667
and that would be great if
that girl were me, but any girl would do.

01:13:36.667 --> 01:13:38.669
And I want...

01:13:38.669 --> 01:13:42.256
I mean, I wish my mom would come home.

01:13:44.383 --> 01:13:48.554
And I really, really want
to win Pipe Masters tomorrow.

01:13:48.554 --> 01:13:50.556
That's what I want.

01:13:50.681 --> 01:13:53.267
Well, do it.

01:13:53.267 --> 01:13:55.394
Matt, you don't understand, okay?

01:13:55.561 --> 01:13:59.523
Pipe... Pipe is the heaviest wave in the world.

01:13:59.565 --> 01:14:02.276
Okay, you don't just get worked there.

01:14:02.401 --> 01:14:04.820
You die. People die there.

01:14:06.822 --> 01:14:08.949
And what happens when I just...

01:14:08.991 --> 01:14:13.120
when I paddle out and
I don't take off on a single wave?

01:14:13.162 --> 01:14:17.124
I don't care if I make a fool out of myself,
but I do not want to embarrass my family.

01:14:17.166 --> 01:14:20.294
And that's what Lena and
Eden and Penny are. They're my family.

01:14:26.717 --> 01:14:29.178
Just tell me what to do, please.

01:14:29.261 --> 01:14:32.598
You want me to tell you what to do? Yes.

01:14:32.723 --> 01:14:36.185
You know what to do.
No, Matt, I honestly don't.

01:14:39.188 --> 01:14:41.607
Just be the girl I met on the beach.

01:14:41.607 --> 01:14:45.486
Who? Who was she?

01:14:45.611 --> 01:14:48.489
A girl who'd never ask a guy what to do.

01:14:54.912 --> 01:14:56.914
Good morning, everybody.
Welcome to the Pipe Masters...

01:14:57.039 --> 01:15:00.042
here at Banzai Pipeline
on the North Shore of Oahu.

01:15:00.042 --> 01:15:02.753
You're gonna be watching
women's surfng history today...

01:15:02.878 --> 01:15:06.048
as these girls take
on the deadliest waves in the world.

01:15:06.215 --> 01:15:10.052
Imagine the Niagara Falls dumping
into two feet of water over hard-rock lava...

01:15:10.177 --> 01:15:12.763
with razor-sharp reef and underwater caves.

01:15:12.805 --> 01:15:15.349
It's gonna be a macking 20 feet.

01:15:15.516 --> 01:15:19.603
Good luck to all the ladies
competing today at the Pipe Masters.

01:15:19.645 --> 01:15:23.232
They may be the best in the world,
but they're gonna have their hands full today.

01:15:23.357 --> 01:15:26.360
If you're going down to watch,
it's not a day for a dip in the water.

01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:30.072
Anne Marie, you all right? Mm-hmm.

01:15:32.533 --> 01:15:35.244
You guys get out here.
I'll go find some parking.

01:15:35.244 --> 01:15:37.621
Pretty much an impossible
score at this point.

01:15:37.663 --> 01:15:41.083
She's way behind, but
she's still gonna try and put it on the line.

01:15:41.250 --> 01:15:45.671
Looks like she's goin'for this one.
Oh.! She broke her board.

01:15:45.671 --> 01:15:49.550
Any day at Pipeline, it's critical,
but today,

01:15:49.675 --> 01:15:53.846
one false move and
the consequences could be disastrous.

01:15:53.971 --> 01:15:58.559
More surfers have died here
than any other spot on the planet combined.

01:15:58.684 --> 01:16:01.854
This is the first time the girls
have gotten to compete at Pipeline.

01:16:01.937 --> 01:16:04.690
The entire surfcommunity is here today...

01:16:04.690 --> 01:16:09.570
every sponsor, talent scout, the entire surf media..
looking to find the next surfsensation.

01:16:09.570 --> 01:16:13.824
Get one good ride here today,
and you'll put yourself on the surfng map.

01:16:13.866 --> 01:16:15.868
Out there all by
herself is Lynette MacKenzie,

01:16:15.993 --> 01:16:18.162
now that Megan's on the beach
with a broken board.

01:16:18.162 --> 01:16:20.581
She's in on a nice one. She's comin'in.

01:16:25.002 --> 01:16:27.880
You really have to commit
if you are gonna get those waves.

01:16:28.005 --> 01:16:31.592
But I'm sure it'll better
the score she already has.

01:16:31.717 --> 01:16:34.011
Good luck, Layne.
Thanks. I could use it.

01:16:34.011 --> 01:16:36.597
I'm here for the competition.
Are you a volunteer?

01:16:36.722 --> 01:16:39.016
She's a competitor.
You need to sign this release form.

01:16:44.021 --> 01:16:46.732
"In case of death or dismemberment"?

01:16:46.899 --> 01:16:49.443
Thank you.
You'll be in heat four with Kate Skarratt.

01:16:49.485 --> 01:16:51.487
You can go ahead and
wait in the competitors' area.

01:16:51.570 --> 01:16:54.323
Thank you. Good luck.

01:16:54.448 --> 01:16:56.450
It's looking pretty solid out there,
isn't it?

01:17:00.287 --> 01:17:03.207
Oh, my gosh.

01:17:03.290 --> 01:17:06.335
There's Kate Skarratt.
She kills at Pipe.

01:17:06.335 --> 01:17:09.505
And there's Rochelle Ballard.
She's queen ofback door.

01:17:09.630 --> 01:17:12.883
- Oh, my gosh.! Layne Beachley is...
- I know who they are.

01:17:12.925 --> 01:17:14.885
What? I'm... You're good.

01:17:14.927 --> 01:17:17.346
I'm just saying... they're...
they're really good.

01:17:22.643 --> 01:17:24.645
Shit.!

01:17:24.770 --> 01:17:28.232
Come on. Let's go.

01:17:28.357 --> 01:17:31.944
Hey! What's up, man?  What's up?

01:17:32.069 --> 01:17:36.782
Where's parking around here?
Anywhere, I guess Whatever you can find.

01:17:36.824 --> 01:17:39.076
Looks like she's goin'on this one.

01:17:45.541 --> 01:17:47.543
Hey. Hey, Anne Marie.
Look what I found.

01:17:47.626 --> 01:17:51.547
Next heat, Keala Kennelly.
Hey. Just driving by.

01:17:51.630 --> 01:17:53.632
What's up, surfer girl?

01:17:53.674 --> 01:17:56.135
- Do the damn thing. -

01:17:56.135 --> 01:17:59.555
- Shit.
- Twenty-foot swell on the rise.

01:18:01.140 --> 01:18:03.267
Pretty weird out there.

01:18:03.267 --> 01:18:07.563
It's a super-clean, west-northwest swell.

01:18:07.688 --> 01:18:10.816
Pipe and back door are both open.

01:18:10.858 --> 01:18:13.819
Yeah. Just be patient. Don't get too anxious.

01:18:13.861 --> 01:18:17.823
It's four-wave sets with
20-second intervals. Take your time.

01:18:17.865 --> 01:18:20.576
Don't take the first wave of the set.

01:18:20.701 --> 01:18:22.411
Third wave looks the best.

01:18:22.536 --> 01:18:26.415
Here comes Kennelly taking off. Steep drop.

01:18:26.415 --> 01:18:29.001
She makes the bottom turn. She's fierce, man.

01:18:29.001 --> 01:18:31.420
Gets covered up.

01:18:33.297 --> 01:18:35.591
Oh.! She makes it out.

01:18:35.716 --> 01:18:38.886
Let's give her a warm round
of applause. I'm way out of my league.

01:18:39.011 --> 01:18:41.847
Hey. No worries.

01:18:41.889 --> 01:18:45.893
Just go out there and have fun. "Fun."

01:18:49.313 --> 01:18:53.025
Up next, from Australia,
we have Kate Skarratt in red.

01:18:53.192 --> 01:18:56.153
She's a goofy foot,
which favors her at Pipeline.

01:18:56.195 --> 01:18:59.448
Loves charging big waves
and has taken first place at Teahupoo,

01:18:59.490 --> 01:19:02.034
another barreling left-hander in Tahiti.

01:19:02.159 --> 01:19:05.579
Surfng against her, we have wild card
entry, Anne Marie Chadwick,

01:19:05.621 --> 01:19:09.333
a formerJunior NSSA champion
who dropped out of the competitive circuit...

01:19:09.500 --> 01:19:14.463
after a near-drowning incident
at this very spot just three years ago.

01:19:14.505 --> 01:19:18.926
Five, four, three, two, one.

01:19:55.254 --> 01:19:58.382
We've got 20-minute heats today
with the top four waves scoring.

01:19:58.507 --> 01:20:00.968
Wave selection is critical.

01:20:01.093 --> 01:20:03.929
If you pick the wrong wave,
wipe out, get caught inside...

01:20:03.971 --> 01:20:08.142
You could spend the rest of
your heatjust trying to get back to the lineup.

01:20:08.267 --> 01:20:10.227
How's it goin'? Good.

01:20:10.269 --> 01:20:13.689
Nice set approaching.
Got good sets out the back.

01:20:13.689 --> 01:20:17.151
We have really good consistency
with swell. It's on the rise.

01:20:17.234 --> 01:20:19.570
Probably gonna get up to
about 15 to 20 feet.

01:20:19.695 --> 01:20:23.699
Kate Skarratt's goin' on this one.
She's paddling, gets to her feet.

01:20:23.699 --> 01:20:26.702
Makes the drop. Solid bottom turn.

01:20:29.163 --> 01:20:31.165
Look at that pit.!

01:20:31.290 --> 01:20:34.585
She's setting her line, racing to make it out.

01:20:34.710 --> 01:20:37.254
Trying to get to the shoulder.

01:20:37.296 --> 01:20:42.009
Traveling... Oh.!
She didn't quite get around that last turn.

01:20:44.136 --> 01:20:46.472
She'll get some kind of score for it.

01:20:46.555 --> 01:20:50.476
Looks like it's a 4. 1 that came in on the board.

01:20:50.559 --> 01:20:53.479
Water patrol's checking on her.
Looks like she's okay.

01:20:53.562 --> 01:20:57.024
If she doesn't need a ride,
she can paddle back out.

01:20:57.191 --> 01:21:01.612
So Chadwick all alone by herself
out there, yet to even score a ride.

01:21:03.906 --> 01:21:06.283
Go, go! Paddle!
Headed for her first ride.

01:21:14.333 --> 01:21:16.335
Backs out. Shit!

01:21:20.631 --> 01:21:23.926
- Beautiful wave. She's not gonna get any more like that.
- What a waste of wave.

01:21:24.051 --> 01:21:26.345
She should've gone.
That would have opened up perfectly.

01:21:26.512 --> 01:21:28.472
Shit!

01:21:28.514 --> 01:21:32.935
When you're out there all alone,
you can psyche yourself out. You can do it, girl.

01:21:33.060 --> 01:21:35.062
- Chadwick will have to wait for the next set.
- What are you doin'?

01:21:35.229 --> 01:21:38.357
Kate Skarratt's paddling into
one of the best waves of the day.

01:21:38.357 --> 01:21:41.819
0h.! Look at this wave. It is a bomb.

01:21:41.902 --> 01:21:46.615
Oh.! She's a little overextended and goes down.

01:22:02.965 --> 01:22:06.677
-	Hope she's okay out there.
-	Kate Skarratt down. - Ooh.

01:22:10.681 --> 01:22:14.268
Great pickup.
Gets her on the sled, out ofharm's way.

01:22:14.393 --> 01:22:16.395
Hang on.

01:22:18.397 --> 01:22:22.568
Okay, everybody, as the ski comes up
on the beach, please give them some room.

01:22:22.693 --> 01:22:24.695
The water patrol needs some space to work.

01:22:24.695 --> 01:22:28.282
Skate Skarratt has gone down
on that last wave.

01:22:28.407 --> 01:22:30.576
They're carrying the backboard down.
This isn't good.

01:22:30.701 --> 01:22:33.287
We need Dr. Leland Dao to report to the medical tent.

01:22:33.412 --> 01:22:35.539
Leland Dao, please report to the medical tent.

01:22:35.581 --> 01:22:38.167
We need you down here immediately.

01:22:42.004 --> 01:22:43.839
Come on. Come on.

01:22:50.304 --> 01:22:52.723
Charge it!

01:22:54.725 --> 01:22:57.728
Go, go, go! Go! Go!

01:22:57.728 --> 01:23:00.314
Go! Go! Go!

01:23:07.613 --> 01:23:09.740
She sets her rail.

01:23:09.740 --> 01:23:12.284
Makes the drop. Textbook. Oh.!

01:23:12.326 --> 01:23:14.328
It's setting up perfectly.

01:23:14.453 --> 01:23:17.289
Look at that. Beautiful wave.

01:23:21.460 --> 01:23:23.754
She should get a nice score for this one,
Yes!

01:23:23.879 --> 01:23:26.215
high enough to take her
into the next round.

01:23:38.060 --> 01:23:40.062
- Oh.! -

01:23:46.193 --> 01:23:48.362
- Oh, she got so worked. -

01:24:27.401 --> 01:24:29.695
I don't see her. Where is she?

01:24:29.862 --> 01:24:32.990
Man, is she all right? Where is she?

01:25:00.893 --> 01:25:02.478
Oh!

01:25:31.799 --> 01:25:34.593
Anne Marie's taking a heavy beating out there.

01:25:46.939 --> 01:25:48.941
Grab my hand.

01:25:51.068 --> 01:25:53.070
I got you. Hang on.

01:25:59.201 --> 01:26:03.080
Not that she cares right now,
but thejudges' scores havejust come in...

01:26:03.247 --> 01:26:05.666
and they've awarded her a 4.6
for the last ride,

01:26:05.791 --> 01:26:09.378
which will move her into the next round
over Skarratt.

01:26:10.671 --> 01:26:12.923
- Anne Marie! 
- Are you okay?

01:26:15.926 --> 01:26:17.845
- Is she gonna be all right? 
- Is she gonna be all right?

01:26:17.970 --> 01:26:20.681
She'll be okay. Just give her some room.

01:26:20.806 --> 01:26:22.975
Is she gonna be okay?

01:26:23.142 --> 01:26:25.144
I think so.

01:26:30.691 --> 01:26:33.694
I'm gonna put some ice on it.

01:26:33.819 --> 01:26:35.696
Lift your head.

01:26:38.949 --> 01:26:40.951
Just lay there and relax for a minute.

01:26:46.248 --> 01:26:48.250
Hey.

01:26:48.292 --> 01:26:51.712
If you tell me to be the girl on the beach
right now, I'm gonna kick your ass.

01:26:51.879 --> 01:26:54.131
Oh.

01:26:56.175 --> 01:26:59.011
So how are you feelin'? I've been better.

01:26:59.011 --> 01:27:01.889
Yeah.

01:27:04.016 --> 01:27:06.143
My, uh, my first NFL game,

01:27:06.185 --> 01:27:09.480
I got blindsided by Warren Sapp.

01:27:09.480 --> 01:27:12.024
I tell you,
I've never been hit so hard in my life.

01:27:12.024 --> 01:27:16.487
I lay there praying something was broken
so I wouldn't have to get up and finish the game.

01:27:16.487 --> 01:27:21.158
You think I'm faking?
No. I know you got rocked out there.

01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:24.620
Just like I did. But Leslie sat me down,

01:27:24.620 --> 01:27:29.333
said that was the hardest I'd ever be hit
and that I would regret not going back in.

01:27:29.500 --> 01:27:32.294
So l... I went back in.

01:27:32.336 --> 01:27:34.755
And you won the game.

01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:37.216
No. Actually, we lost.

01:27:37.216 --> 01:27:41.512
And I got my ass kicked.

01:27:42.930 --> 01:27:46.642
But there's this one beautiful pass...

01:27:46.809 --> 01:27:51.230
one perfect spiral right into Omar's fingertips...

01:27:51.230 --> 01:27:53.357
and a touchdown.

01:27:55.818 --> 01:27:59.363
Look, I can't talk you into goin'back out there.

01:27:59.363 --> 01:28:01.657
It's... It seems crazy.

01:28:04.076 --> 01:28:08.956
But I know how good you are, and
I know how much this means to you.

01:28:09.081 --> 01:28:13.210
I just don't want you to spend
your life wondering what could have been.

01:28:20.801 --> 01:28:23.512
Heads up on the beach, people.
Big set approaching.

01:28:23.554 --> 01:28:26.140
Hey, everybody,
we have a set out the back.

01:28:26.265 --> 01:28:28.684
Watch your kids.
Watch your belongings.

01:28:28.684 --> 01:28:31.854
The water is coming over the berm.
It's dangerous out there.

01:28:31.937 --> 01:28:34.690
The water patrol already has their hands full,

01:28:34.690 --> 01:28:37.234
so we'd appreciate it if you'djust back up.

01:28:37.276 --> 01:28:39.987
Here today we have a rising swell,

01:28:40.154 --> 01:28:43.240
so I wanna give a little word
of warning to everybody to watch out.

01:28:43.282 --> 01:28:46.243
Guys, look, this is really not a good time.
Can I get a picture?

01:28:46.285 --> 01:28:48.704
What? Can we get a picture?
We're working these chicks here.

01:28:48.704 --> 01:28:51.290
They think you're some kind of
great hockey player or something.

01:28:51.290 --> 01:28:55.878
You're kidding. No joke. We wanna get this thing done.

01:28:56.003 --> 01:28:59.548
Sorry my pits stink.
That's just the way it goes. Let's go. Right here.

01:28:59.590 --> 01:29:01.717
Smile. You're on vacation.
This way, this way.

01:29:01.884 --> 01:29:04.178
Fluff your bangs a little bit.
A little more attitude.

01:29:04.303 --> 01:29:07.014
Beautiful. One more.
All right, great.

01:29:07.139 --> 01:29:09.016
Hey. Hey.

01:29:09.183 --> 01:29:11.477
You goin' back out there? Yup.

01:29:11.560 --> 01:29:13.729
It's just a stupid contest.
It's not worth getting hurt over.

01:29:13.729 --> 01:29:15.731
I'll be fine. Hey.

01:29:15.898 --> 01:29:19.735
- What? - Be careful.

01:29:19.735 --> 01:29:22.446
Yeah.

01:29:22.905 --> 01:29:26.200
- - That sounds the start of the next heat.

01:29:26.325 --> 01:29:29.328
Chadwick's pretty much got
her hands full this next round.

01:29:29.495 --> 01:29:31.914
Keala Kennelly from Hawaii.
She's a charger.

01:29:32.039 --> 01:29:35.042
She'll go on anything.
She goes like a man out here.

01:29:41.799 --> 01:29:43.634
Bit of a paddle battle going on out there.

01:29:43.759 --> 01:29:47.221
Looks like Chadwick and
Kennelly are paddling for the peak.

01:29:47.346 --> 01:29:49.348
Chadwick's got the inside position.

01:29:49.515 --> 01:29:51.934
-	Lf a big set approaches, she's gonna get
-	the first wave. - Come on, come on.

01:29:52.059 --> 01:29:54.520
This paddle battle is really about
who's gonna get the first wave.

01:29:54.603 --> 01:29:57.356
Chadwick in position, heading
for the first wave.

01:29:57.356 --> 01:29:59.358
Starts to paddle. She's goin'for it.

01:30:01.360 --> 01:30:05.948
Oh.! She... She pulls back.
Kennelly's wide open. She catches a wave.

01:30:10.953 --> 01:30:13.539
Time and time again, man.

01:30:31.390 --> 01:30:34.143
She's out, making it look so easy.

01:30:34.268 --> 01:30:36.979
But, folks, it's not easy out there.

01:30:36.979 --> 01:30:40.983
Chadwick starts to paddle.
She paddles for it.

01:30:41.150 --> 01:30:43.152
Doesn't quite get it.

01:30:45.571 --> 01:30:47.573
What a waste of wave.

01:30:51.160 --> 01:30:55.414
That's gotta hurt when
you know you need a score,

01:30:55.414 --> 01:30:58.584
and you're going up against
one of the best surfers in this event,

01:30:58.709 --> 01:31:01.003
and you don't go.

01:31:01.170 --> 01:31:04.173
Plenty of time being allowed
here for Kennelly to get back in position,

01:31:04.256 --> 01:31:06.884
and she's paddled right inside of Chadwick,

01:31:06.884 --> 01:31:08.886
and she's looking to catch her next wave.

01:31:30.157 --> 01:31:32.743
Keala Kennelly. Hands together,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:31:32.868 --> 01:31:35.621
Keala Kennelly. A great two-ride out
here at the Pipeline.

01:31:35.621 --> 01:31:39.917
Keala's got sack.
She goes like the men out here.

01:31:39.917 --> 01:31:43.212
For some reason, Chadwick has yet
to even ride a wave. I don't know what's going on.

01:31:43.212 --> 01:31:46.882
I don't know if she's just psyching
herself out or if Keala's putting it to her.

01:31:52.930 --> 01:31:55.766
What are you doin'? What?

01:31:55.808 --> 01:31:57.643
You gonna take a wave or
just sit there like a buoy?

01:31:57.643 --> 01:32:01.939
Look, you're never gonna catch a wave
sitting all the way over here.

01:32:01.939 --> 01:32:06.610
Follow me. I'll get you into one.
Give the crowd something to cheer about.

01:32:06.652 --> 01:32:08.654
Let's get you a wave. Come on.

01:32:10.489 --> 01:32:14.618
Follow me into the lineup, and
I'm gonna tell you to go on a wave.

01:32:14.660 --> 01:32:16.662
And when I tell you to go, you gotta go.

01:32:16.829 --> 01:32:19.957
Paddle your little heart out.
You can't hesitate. You can't pull back.

01:32:19.957 --> 01:32:22.251
You can't hold back. No fear, all right?

01:32:22.376 --> 01:32:25.379
'Cause if you hold back
for a second, you're gonna eat shit.

01:32:25.546 --> 01:32:27.548
Come on. Follow me.

01:32:33.137 --> 01:32:35.556
It looks like the next set's approaching.

01:32:35.681 --> 01:32:38.934
This is the one. Go.

01:32:38.976 --> 01:32:42.104
Paddle! Paddle! Go, girl! Paddle! Paddle!

01:32:42.146 --> 01:32:44.690
Paddle.!

01:32:44.690 --> 01:32:46.692
Ah!

01:32:46.692 --> 01:32:48.694
Go.!

01:32:51.864 --> 01:32:53.407
Oh!

01:33:31.737 --> 01:33:35.032
You all right? I'm okay, I'm okay.

01:33:35.157 --> 01:33:37.493
Get back out there then.

01:33:41.747 --> 01:33:44.750
- - With only two minutes left in her heat,

01:33:44.917 --> 01:33:46.919
Chadwick struggles
to get back into the lineup...

01:33:46.919 --> 01:33:49.797
so she can catch a scoring wave.

01:33:49.922 --> 01:33:52.883
Chadwick has yet to even score
a good ride, a scoring ride.

01:33:52.925 --> 01:33:56.929
She needs to redeem herself.
Keala is absolutely dominating this heat,

01:33:57.054 --> 01:33:59.223
and Chadwick needs to put
a scoring ride on the board.

01:34:11.610 --> 01:34:13.946
Ouch. Are you all right?

01:34:14.071 --> 01:34:16.532
That was nasty. It's okay. I want another one.

01:34:16.615 --> 01:34:18.909
- You want another one? That's the spirit. - Yup.

01:34:18.951 --> 01:34:20.661
Shake off that last wave, and let's do this.

01:34:20.786 --> 01:34:23.539
Less than 20 seconds left.
Feel that adrenaline. Use it. Come on.

01:34:23.664 --> 01:34:26.375
Anne Marie Chadwick
only has one more chance.

01:34:28.627 --> 01:34:32.256
On the outside. Here comes
one of the best sets of the whole day.

01:34:32.256 --> 01:34:34.967
We have lines stacked to the horizon.

01:34:41.390 --> 01:34:44.268
Here comes a set. This is the one.

01:34:44.268 --> 01:34:47.813
All right, come on. Go.! Go, go.!

01:34:47.855 --> 01:34:50.274
Go, girl.!

01:34:50.274 --> 01:34:52.985
- Chadwick's out there. - Paddle hard!

01:34:52.985 --> 01:34:55.279
- Go! Go! Go! -

01:34:55.404 --> 01:34:57.573
This is yours.! Don't pull back.!

01:34:57.698 --> 01:35:00.576
- Go, go! - Go.! Go.! Go.!

01:35:11.879 --> 01:35:13.464
Oh, my gosh!

01:35:37.029 --> 01:35:40.157
Oh, my gosh!

01:35:55.464 --> 01:35:57.925
Oh, shit! Yeah!

01:35:59.510 --> 01:36:01.512
- Whoo! - Yeah!

01:36:02.638 --> 01:36:05.182
- Whoo! - Oh, she makes it.!

01:36:05.224 --> 01:36:07.518
That's my bitch!

01:36:18.362 --> 01:36:21.824
Yeah! That was insane!

01:36:27.496 --> 01:36:30.082
- Whoo! - Waiting for thejudges'scores.

01:36:30.082 --> 01:36:34.086
They're coming in.
Looks like unanimous tens across the board,

01:36:34.128 --> 01:36:36.839
but not enough to overtake
Kennelly and move into the next round.

01:36:36.922 --> 01:36:42.386
- But she is a hero with the crowd here today.
- That's my sister! Whoo!

01:36:42.553 --> 01:36:44.138
That's my sister!

01:36:44.680 --> 01:36:46.265
Just words don't explain it.

01:36:46.265 --> 01:36:49.518
For Anne Marie Chadwick
to get a ride like that...

01:36:49.560 --> 01:36:52.688
with the entire North Shore
surfng community watching...

01:36:59.403 --> 01:37:01.572
That was insane!

01:37:01.572 --> 01:37:05.409
We're so proud of her.

01:37:10.289 --> 01:37:13.709
Can I have your autograph?
Can I have your autograph?

01:37:13.876 --> 01:37:16.712
I taught her everything she knows.

01:37:16.879 --> 01:37:18.881
That's our girl.

01:37:19.006 --> 01:37:21.300
Hey.

01:37:21.300 --> 01:37:25.304
That was awesome. Thank you.

01:37:25.304 --> 01:37:29.892
Hey, you should, uh,
check out the board. Boards By Eden.

01:37:29.892 --> 01:37:32.478
Hey, Anne Marie. Excuse me. Hi.

01:37:32.478 --> 01:37:35.022
I'm Jessica from Billabong. 
I'd love to talk to you about being on our team.

01:37:35.147 --> 01:37:37.316
- Wait your turn, honey. - Okay.

01:37:37.483 --> 01:37:41.904
- Does she know she got beat? 
- Nice, isn't it?

01:37:42.029 --> 01:37:46.033
Hey. Yeah!

01:37:46.200 --> 01:37:48.619
Whoo!

01:37:48.619 --> 01:37:51.914
You did the damn thing, girl.
Thanks. Hey.

01:37:51.914 --> 01:37:54.041
Hey. You were so amazing.

01:37:54.166 --> 01:37:56.627
Oh. Are you okay? I'm so happy.

01:37:56.627 --> 01:37:58.754
Oh, that was insane.

01:37:58.796 --> 01:38:00.798
But I still think you
owe me a few surf lessons.

01:38:00.881 --> 01:38:03.634
Oh, yeah? Wanna go out there?

01:38:08.222 --> 01:38:10.349
Only if you're gentle.

01:38:10.349 --> 01:38:13.936
Not a chance.
