WEBVTT

00:02.001 --> 00:04.035
Ms. Blaine, we're
suspending taylor from school.

00:04.070 --> 00:05.370
There were pictures posted
of your son

00:05.405 --> 00:06.671
Which were
outside the code.

00:06.707 --> 00:08.373
There was a party.
It was for the basketball team.

00:08.408 --> 00:10.442
<i>He was really
messed up.</i>

00:10.477 --> 00:12.143
I think
someone did something to me.

00:12.179 --> 00:14.079
A student is claiming
to have been assaulted.

00:14.114 --> 00:15.247
By one of my players?

00:15.282 --> 00:17.148
Don't think your kids
are above mistakes.

00:17.184 --> 00:19.551
We have to make it clear
we take this matter seriously,

00:19.586 --> 00:21.319
911.
What's your emergency?

00:21.355 --> 00:22.587
I want to report a rape.

00:22.623 --> 00:24.256
You need to discipline
one of your players.

00:24.291 --> 00:26.525
Who am i supposed to sit?
Well, it was
the captain's party.

00:26.560 --> 00:28.360
Eric tanner.
That little bitch
said something.

00:28.395 --> 00:29.828
It's nothing.
Well, it's nothing for you.

00:29.863 --> 00:31.096
They're not doing anything
to you.

00:31.131 --> 00:32.229
Good looks.
You've got money.

00:32.266 --> 00:33.398
There are girls out there,

00:33.433 --> 00:35.233
They're gonna be coming hard
at you for that.

00:35.269 --> 00:36.501
You know
who he should be seeing?

00:36.537 --> 00:37.869
Rhys bashir's daughter.

00:37.905 --> 00:38.870
Hey, lookit.
That's nikki?

00:38.906 --> 00:40.071
Yeah, man.
Bitch looking good.

00:40.107 --> 00:41.773
We're not just talking
about feeding kids.

00:41.808 --> 00:43.508
This is
a civil rights issue.
A civil rights issue?

00:43.544 --> 00:44.609
So what's the problem?

00:44.645 --> 00:46.378
That the people being hurt
don't look like you?

00:46.413 --> 00:47.746
What are you doing
about what happened to him?

00:47.781 --> 00:49.014
You came in
and gave a statement.

00:49.049 --> 00:50.215
Six times,
you used the phrase

00:50.250 --> 00:51.216
"i'm not sure."

00:51.251 --> 00:52.651
You signed that statement.

00:52.686 --> 00:54.019
That school
wants to hide it.

00:54.054 --> 00:55.387
The police
want to ignore it.

00:55.422 --> 00:57.689
Are you sure
you want to go public with this?

00:57.724 --> 00:58.690
Yes.

00:59.793 --> 01:03.061
Seating for 2,442 people.

01:03.096 --> 01:06.498
Boxes in the parterre,
mezzanine, and balcony levels.

01:06.533 --> 01:08.233
As far as the sound --

01:08.268 --> 01:12.170
It's got to feel like --
i want it to be an experience.

01:12.205 --> 01:15.240
It's one of the finest
event spaces in the midwest.

01:15.275 --> 01:18.610
Everyone will feel every moment
of the performance.

01:18.645 --> 01:20.545
These allegations of
sexual assault are very serious.

01:20.581 --> 01:22.347
And we've taken them
very seriously.

01:22.382 --> 01:24.149
We were the ones who made
the report to the police.

01:24.184 --> 01:26.084
<i>Ms. Blaine said
she called the police.</i>

01:26.119 --> 01:27.786
Well,
she may have eventually,

01:27.821 --> 01:30.322
But we met with her
at least three times

01:30.357 --> 01:32.524
Before she chose
to contact them.

01:32.559 --> 01:36.561
Each time, she was emotional,
um, vague.

01:36.597 --> 01:38.897
I have --
i have the signed statement

01:38.932 --> 01:40.966
That we gave
to the police.

01:41.034 --> 01:42.634
Makes it hard to follow up
when the answer

01:42.669 --> 01:44.369
To every other question is,
"i don't know."

01:44.404 --> 01:46.371
She claims her son
was drugged.

01:46.406 --> 01:47.939
We have no way
of knowing that,

01:47.975 --> 01:50.709
But if there was
even the slightest
chance that were true,

01:50.744 --> 01:53.078
We felt we had a responsibility
to call the police.

01:53.113 --> 01:55.013
But you suspended her son?

01:55.048 --> 01:57.315
For what he was doing
in those pictures, yes.

01:57.351 --> 01:59.684
There was alcohol at that party,
drug use by some --

01:59.720 --> 02:02.554
No one -- not the police --
have mentioned drugs.

02:02.589 --> 02:05.223
So why single out
one student?

02:05.258 --> 02:07.392
No one was singled out.
And a student
who's on financial aid.

02:07.427 --> 02:09.060
We suspended her son.

02:09.096 --> 02:13.064
We suspended one of the captains
of the basketball team.

02:16.470 --> 02:19.070
I show you this
in confidence.

02:19.106 --> 02:21.272
Here's the notice
of his suspension.

02:21.308 --> 02:22.807
We don't play favorites.

02:22.843 --> 02:26.211
Every student
is treated equally.

02:26.246 --> 02:28.747
I understand ms. Blaine
may feel otherwise,

02:28.782 --> 02:30.548
But we've done
all that we can.

02:30.584 --> 02:31.583
Even at that,

02:31.618 --> 02:33.151
She's dissatisfied
with our response.

02:33.186 --> 02:36.821
She's apparently dissatisfied
with the police response, too.

02:36.857 --> 02:39.557
It might be more productive
to focus on why her son

02:39.593 --> 02:43.294
Was out binge drinking
in the first place.

02:43.330 --> 02:46.765
I hope you'll give that
equal weight in your article.

02:48.235 --> 02:49.200
How is it?

02:52.272 --> 02:54.506
Wonderful.

02:56.000 --> 03:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:07.054 --> 03:10.255
So, tell me what's going on.

03:10.290 --> 03:11.856
How are you feeling?

03:17.264 --> 03:19.564
I'm sorry i ever opened
my mouth.

03:19.599 --> 03:24.602
I'm sorry i ever said anything
about what happened to me.

03:24.638 --> 03:26.438
Why?

03:28.909 --> 03:31.142
You don't know?

03:32.412 --> 03:34.045
Ashamed.

03:34.081 --> 03:36.581
It's what everything
i read online tells me to feel.

03:36.616 --> 03:39.617
Do you feel ashamed?

03:39.653 --> 03:43.488
I got my mom dragging me around
to the cops, to doctors.

03:43.523 --> 03:45.323
She's telling them
i got assaulted,

03:45.358 --> 03:49.461
And...They're all just,
like, smirking

03:49.496 --> 03:52.397
And cutting on me and...

03:52.432 --> 03:54.532
Why do you think that?

03:54.568 --> 03:56.501
<i>I don't think it.
They're -- they were doing it.</i>

03:56.536 --> 03:59.904
Look, if i was a girl...

03:59.940 --> 04:01.473
Peop-- people lose
their minds

04:01.508 --> 04:03.174
When something happens
to a girl.

04:03.210 --> 04:05.143
They have rights groups
supporting them.

04:05.178 --> 04:10.281
They have lesbians out
hating men, but...A guy?

04:10.317 --> 04:11.583
You really believe

04:11.618 --> 04:13.718
People don't care
when a male is violated?

04:16.757 --> 04:18.656
I put a mattress on my back
and carry it around,

04:18.692 --> 04:21.326
You think they're gonna
put me on tv?

04:21.361 --> 04:22.660
Is that what you want?

04:22.696 --> 04:24.662
You want that kind
of attention?

04:24.698 --> 04:26.197
I just want it to be over.

04:26.233 --> 04:28.199
I go on instagram,
i go on vine,

04:28.235 --> 04:29.634
And somebody's got
my picture,

04:29.669 --> 04:33.271
Somebody's saying
some stuff, and...

04:33.306 --> 04:35.406
My mom just keeps
wanting me to talk about it.

04:35.442 --> 04:37.375
She's -- she's doing
interviews and crap.

04:37.410 --> 04:38.309
She's --

04:38.345 --> 04:39.878
She just wants
to be there for you.

04:39.913 --> 04:41.546
Now she does.

04:41.581 --> 04:44.649
Now?

04:44.684 --> 04:46.151
Do you doubt the choices
she's made?

04:46.186 --> 04:49.220
I don't want to talk
about old stuff.
Not to me.

04:49.256 --> 04:53.758
If there are things you feel
like you're holding on to...

04:53.794 --> 04:56.694
Have you ever tried to talk them
through with your mother?

05:01.735 --> 05:05.103
She's got enough
she's got to worry about.

05:07.440 --> 05:08.673
Let me see it.
No. No.

05:08.708 --> 05:10.041
Who you been texting,
then?

05:10.076 --> 05:11.242
Nothing. No one.
It's --

05:11.278 --> 05:12.844
What have you been doing?
Who have you been texting?

05:12.879 --> 05:14.512
Thank you. Okay.
Thank you.

05:14.548 --> 05:15.713
It's not a big deal.

05:15.749 --> 05:16.714
You're obviously
hiding something.

05:16.750 --> 05:17.649
Not a deal --
it is not a big deal.

05:17.684 --> 05:18.750
Come on.
Stop! Ow!

05:18.785 --> 05:19.851
Let me see it.
Stop!

05:19.886 --> 05:21.252
stop it.

05:21.288 --> 05:23.221
What -- you're causing
a scene in here.
Stop it. Shh!

05:23.256 --> 05:24.422
You know --
be quiet.

05:24.457 --> 05:25.924
I'm tr-- you -- me?
Is everything all right?

05:25.959 --> 05:27.158
What?

05:27.194 --> 05:29.294
Is everything all right?

05:29.329 --> 05:31.029
Not your business.

05:31.064 --> 05:33.498
Well, i'm the manager.
It is my business.
Well, she's fine.

05:33.533 --> 05:34.732
I'm talking to her.

05:34.768 --> 05:35.967
Mm.

05:36.002 --> 05:39.304
We're just messing around.

05:40.140 --> 05:43.241
Okay, you -- can you...
Please not do that?

05:43.276 --> 05:45.944
I'll touch her
however i want.

05:45.979 --> 05:49.647
you need to get out.

05:49.683 --> 05:52.317
Bitch, don't talk to me
like that.
Babe.

05:52.352 --> 05:53.818
...Her.
We didn't do anything.

05:53.854 --> 05:56.688
You need to get out now.

05:56.723 --> 05:59.057
Let's just go.
Please.

06:28.188 --> 06:29.420
You're done.

06:29.456 --> 06:31.489
I'm terminating
your employment here

06:31.524 --> 06:33.424
As of today.

06:33.460 --> 06:34.425
Why?

06:34.461 --> 06:35.793
You know why.

06:35.829 --> 06:36.895
I don't.

06:36.930 --> 06:39.197
I've been trying to get in
with you for a week.

06:39.232 --> 06:40.798
Debra,
i've been here all week.

06:40.834 --> 06:42.700
If you couldn't get
in contact with me,

06:42.736 --> 06:44.535
You should've talked
to ed.

06:44.571 --> 06:45.436
Ed?

06:45.472 --> 06:47.672
Ed's been
singling me out.

06:47.707 --> 06:50.742
Ed has given you five
verbal warnings before today.

06:50.777 --> 06:54.579
For petty stuff, terri.
He was picking on me.

06:56.149 --> 06:58.082
Then you should have
talked to h.R.

06:58.118 --> 07:00.418
They don't care.
They don't want to fix problems.

07:00.453 --> 07:03.721
They just make them
go away.

07:03.757 --> 07:05.790
Do you have any
final questions for me?

07:05.825 --> 07:09.060
God, terri, please.

07:09.095 --> 07:11.829
Your cubicle is being packed
by security.

07:11.865 --> 07:13.998
Can't you move me
under somebody else?

07:14.034 --> 07:15.300
No.

07:15.335 --> 07:20.004
You run this division.
You can't do anything for me?

07:21.374 --> 07:23.775
You'll have to sign
for your personal belongings

07:23.810 --> 07:24.943
When you pick them up.

07:24.978 --> 07:28.279
I wish you luck
in all your endeavors.

07:45.665 --> 07:47.832
"can't you do anything
for me?"

07:47.867 --> 07:51.636
They show up late
every other day,

07:51.671 --> 07:54.672
Do substandard work
when they're there,

07:54.708 --> 07:57.675
Ignore every single warning
you give them,

07:57.711 --> 08:00.311
But the minute
they're in trouble

08:00.347 --> 08:02.513
out comes the black card.

08:03.483 --> 08:04.949
i mean, seriously.

08:05.018 --> 08:07.685
It's like, "c-can you just make
this one exception?

08:07.721 --> 08:11.356
Can't you just help me out
this one time, sista?"

08:11.391 --> 08:12.957
You know what?

08:12.993 --> 08:15.860
That's the one advantage
white people have.

08:15.895 --> 08:17.628
Because they only
have one, right?

08:17.664 --> 08:20.965
okay,
but the one i'm talking about --

08:21.001 --> 08:22.800
They don't have to deal
with expectations.

08:22.836 --> 08:25.169
Not expectation, but i-i-i'll
tell you what they do have.

08:25.205 --> 08:28.639
They have this -- this sense
of entitlement, right?

08:28.675 --> 08:30.908
Mm.
That's a whole other...
Dirt poor,
high-school dropouts,

08:30.944 --> 08:32.243
Yes.
And still they give you
this attitude, right?

08:32.278 --> 08:34.445
Right, right, right.
Like, "w-why are you here?"

08:34.481 --> 08:35.947
right, right.

08:35.982 --> 08:38.316
<i>You know, "why are you
telling me what to do?"
yeah.</i>

08:38.351 --> 08:40.918
"because i can afford
to be here. That's why."
mm-hmm.

08:40.953 --> 08:41.986
I am your boss.

08:42.022 --> 08:44.489
That's why i can tell you
what to do.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.457
That's my whole day right there.

08:46.493 --> 08:49.160
I'm dealing with expectations
on one side

08:49.195 --> 08:51.396
And then entitlement
on the other.

08:51.431 --> 08:53.264
Hey, i'm gonna, uh,
take nikki and float some.

08:53.299 --> 08:55.600
Just...
Okay. Kevin.

08:55.635 --> 08:56.801
I'm just --
i'm just showing her around.
Don't --

08:56.836 --> 08:59.037
That's --
don't go far, man.

08:59.072 --> 09:01.539
Okay.
Let's go.

09:01.574 --> 09:04.609
He's enjoying his --
his season, his school, yeah?
Yeah. Yeah, he is.

09:04.644 --> 09:06.677
Well,
he's doing this...
I don't really know
anything about basketball.

09:06.713 --> 09:08.446
but, uh...

09:14.621 --> 09:16.454
What did i tell you
about those hands?

09:16.489 --> 09:18.656
i'm sorry.

09:18.691 --> 09:20.425
What's up
with you and val?

09:20.460 --> 09:21.459
Nothing's up.

09:21.494 --> 09:23.361
You're not together anymore?
Nope.

09:29.669 --> 09:31.736
I know you're not trying to act
like no good girl.

09:31.771 --> 09:33.571
What?

09:33.606 --> 09:34.939
Tell me what you said.

09:34.974 --> 09:38.509
I'm just saying you don't have
to act like you're not down.

09:38.545 --> 09:41.412
I saw the pics you posted
on, uh

09:41.448 --> 09:43.781
Well, that body's --
your body's bangin'.

09:43.817 --> 09:45.516
So that's why
you brought me out here?

09:45.552 --> 09:48.086
You think i get down?

09:48.121 --> 09:49.387
I sent those
to that ass...Eric.

09:49.422 --> 09:51.089
He put those up
'cause that's all i gave him.

09:51.124 --> 09:52.723
Okay, why you getting on me?
I didn't know.

09:52.759 --> 09:54.325
You're all the same --
always trying to get some.

09:54.360 --> 09:55.460
Then, as soon as you do,

09:55.495 --> 09:56.861
You run and tell everybody
how we're all sluts?

09:56.896 --> 09:57.962
That's not even me.

09:57.997 --> 09:59.263
You're, like, notorious.

10:01.201 --> 10:02.600
Okay, what do you know?

10:02.635 --> 10:05.069
I know i'm not a slut.
I know that.

10:13.113 --> 10:15.146
Go over there, then.

10:19.352 --> 10:20.618
Give me your phone.

10:24.824 --> 10:27.291
There.
You can text me.

11:00.560 --> 11:03.060
How come you like
modern stuff so much?

11:06.533 --> 11:09.133
'cause i like being reductive.
It's a challenge.

11:09.169 --> 11:11.335
Hmm.

11:11.371 --> 11:13.571
Mies van der rohe --
"less is more."

11:13.606 --> 11:16.140
Do the most with the least.

11:18.011 --> 11:19.610
How's nikki?

11:19.646 --> 11:20.611
She all right.

11:20.647 --> 11:22.580
"all right"?

11:22.615 --> 11:24.782
We gonna see more of her?

11:24.817 --> 11:29.320
Girls, man --
they just -- just be trippin'.

11:29.355 --> 11:31.088
Yeah, they be trippin'.

11:31.124 --> 11:33.758
Lesson one.

11:33.793 --> 11:36.494
Women -- you just...

11:36.529 --> 11:38.362
You can't win.

11:38.398 --> 11:40.331
So it's about
figuring out how much --

11:40.366 --> 11:41.966
How much you gonna lose.

11:42.001 --> 11:43.201
How much you lose with mom?

11:43.236 --> 11:44.936
Nothing.

11:44.971 --> 11:47.205
You just don't want me
to run and tell, huh?
No, no. No, seriously.

11:47.240 --> 11:48.839
I didn't --
i didn't lose anything.
Okay.

11:48.875 --> 11:51.209
I gave up
a couple of things,

11:51.244 --> 11:54.579
But that was by choice --
big difference.

11:54.614 --> 11:57.114
When i was ready to be with
your mother, i had to decide,

11:57.150 --> 12:00.785
"what kind of husband
are you gonna be,
what kind of father?"

12:00.820 --> 12:05.923
So, yeah,
i...Gave up things.

12:05.959 --> 12:07.658
But i wasn't gonna be
the black man

12:07.694 --> 12:09.493
Who couldn't keep
his family together.

12:09.529 --> 12:10.828
See, that's --
that's what's messed up.

12:10.863 --> 12:13.297
It's like...
Uh, you and mom, right,

12:13.333 --> 12:15.600
You're always doing stuff or
you're not doing this or that

12:15.635 --> 12:17.301
'cause you think
people are watching you.

12:17.337 --> 12:18.836
No, no.

12:18.871 --> 12:21.572
No, we do how we do
no matter what.

12:21.608 --> 12:24.875
But don't ever think
they're not keeping score.

12:28.081 --> 12:29.680
hmm.

12:54.023 --> 12:55.055
Hello.
This is cammy.

12:55.090 --> 12:57.257
You didn't focus
on the rape at all.

12:57.293 --> 12:59.726
You mentioned one guy by name,
but that was it.

12:59.762 --> 13:02.095
I mean, you wrote that
the school called the police?

13:02.131 --> 13:04.631
I mean, it sounds --
it so--
i presented the facts.

13:04.667 --> 13:07.701
I can't call it rape if
the facts don't support that.

13:07.736 --> 13:10.070
I-it sounds weak.

13:10.105 --> 13:12.306
You asked me to keep
you and your son anonymous.

13:12.341 --> 13:13.540
That limits what i can say.

13:13.575 --> 13:15.809
You told me you were
gonna go after the school.

13:15.844 --> 13:17.744
I'm not going
to make things up, anne.

13:17.780 --> 13:21.381
When there are new facts,
i'll report them.

13:23.786 --> 13:25.752
Hello?
Yeah.

13:25.788 --> 13:28.588
If there's something new,
i'll follow up, okay?

13:28.624 --> 13:30.223
Take care, anne.

13:30.259 --> 13:32.759
Yeah.

13:46.809 --> 13:49.509
Good morning.

13:51.580 --> 13:53.814
Terri.
Good morning, tom.

13:53.849 --> 13:56.049
Hey, um,
is kevin okay?

13:56.085 --> 13:57.284
Kevin's fine.

13:57.319 --> 13:59.219
Oh, uh, just the -- the article
made it sound like...

13:59.254 --> 14:01.421
What article?
...He was in trouble
or some--

14:01.457 --> 14:03.423
<i>What article?
Uh, the times herald.</i>

14:03.459 --> 14:06.026
There's something
on their website about kevin,

14:06.061 --> 14:07.928
Something about
a sexual assault.

14:10.299 --> 14:12.065
Are they saying
kevin was assaulted?

14:12.101 --> 14:13.000
I didn't really
understand what --

14:13.035 --> 14:14.935
Uh, what did the police
tell you?

14:14.970 --> 14:16.570
I mean, it's just kids.
It was a party.

14:16.605 --> 14:17.604
Somebody's just --

14:17.639 --> 14:19.139
I mean, it's got to be
a mistake, right?

14:19.174 --> 14:21.475
Just stop talking.

14:21.510 --> 14:22.809
Rob silverman's office.

14:22.845 --> 14:24.211
It's terri lacroix.

14:24.246 --> 14:25.479
Can we return?

14:25.514 --> 14:27.848
I need to speak with him.
What's the best number?

14:27.883 --> 14:29.750
I need to speak
with him now.

14:29.785 --> 14:31.585
Hold on.
Let me see if i can get him.

14:40.129 --> 14:41.194
Hey.

14:41.230 --> 14:42.796
Michael, you have to get kevin
from school.

14:42.831 --> 14:43.897
What's wrong?

14:43.932 --> 14:45.265
There's an article online

14:45.300 --> 14:47.267
About a sexual assault
at a party,

14:47.302 --> 14:48.068
And kevin's name is --
what?

14:48.103 --> 14:48.902
<i> Hello?</i>

14:48.937 --> 14:50.604
Kevin what?
Rob?

14:50.639 --> 14:53.206
Rob, hold on.
Michael, get him now.

14:53.242 --> 14:55.375
I'll call you back
in two minutes.
Okay.

14:56.812 --> 15:00.013
<i>Rob, there's an article online
from the times herald.</i>

15:00.049 --> 15:01.748
Keep talking.
I'm searching for it.

15:01.784 --> 15:03.083
They're saying something

15:03.118 --> 15:05.786
About a sexual assault
that took place at a party,

15:05.821 --> 15:07.621
And kevin's name
was published.

15:07.656 --> 15:08.455
Uh, found it.

15:08.490 --> 15:09.823
Give me two seconds,
terri.

15:11.660 --> 15:12.626
Where is kevin?

15:12.661 --> 15:14.928
Michael is getting him
from school.

15:14.963 --> 15:17.164
Don't say anything
to anyone.
Okay.

15:17.199 --> 15:19.332
If they pick kevin up, just make
sure he doesn't talk to anyone.
Wait, wait, wait.
What do you mean?

15:19.368 --> 15:21.001
If they arrest him?
Take him home.

15:21.036 --> 15:22.569
I'll come to you.
We'll be there.

15:22.604 --> 15:24.137
Okay.

15:27.476 --> 15:29.009
I'm almost at the school.

15:29.044 --> 15:31.545
Okay. Bring him home.
Rob will meet us at the house.

15:31.580 --> 15:32.913
What does the article say?

15:32.948 --> 15:34.781
"indianapolis police

15:34.817 --> 15:36.716
Have confirmed
that they are investigating

15:36.752 --> 15:38.385
Members
of the prestigious

15:38.420 --> 15:39.619
Leyland academy
basketball team."
what does it say
about kevin?

15:39.655 --> 15:41.188
Are you close to the school?

15:41.223 --> 15:42.255
"kevin lacroix, 18,

15:42.291 --> 15:44.291
Captain of
the leyland basketball team,

15:44.326 --> 15:48.095
Hosted the party where
the alleged sexual
assault took place.

15:48.130 --> 15:50.864
Alcohol use documented
on social media..."
oh, god.

15:50.899 --> 15:55.102
I'm on kevin's
facebook page now.

15:55.137 --> 15:56.770
People are already
saying things.

15:56.805 --> 15:58.238
Stop reading that.

15:58.273 --> 15:59.739
wha-- it's been online,

15:59.775 --> 16:01.441
What, two minutes,
and people are already talking?

16:01.477 --> 16:02.642
Stop reading!
I'm here.

16:02.678 --> 16:04.411
i'm at the school.
Listen to me.

16:04.446 --> 16:06.746
It's going to be okay.
Okay?

16:06.782 --> 16:08.448
yeah.

16:08.484 --> 16:10.283
It's going to be okay.
Yeah.

16:10.319 --> 16:12.119
I'll call you
when he's in the car.

16:15.691 --> 16:17.057
<i>You've reached
detective williams</i>

16:17.092 --> 16:18.959
<i>At the indianapolis
metropolitan police department.</i>

16:18.994 --> 16:20.227
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

16:20.295 --> 16:21.495
Ken, it's terri.

16:21.530 --> 16:24.397
I need you to call me
as soon as you get this message.

16:24.433 --> 16:25.599
Call me on my cell.

16:31.640 --> 16:33.507
You rented the space
for the party?

16:33.542 --> 16:34.474
Yeah.

16:34.510 --> 16:36.443
Was there alcohol?

16:36.478 --> 16:37.544
Answer him.

16:37.579 --> 16:38.545
Yes.

16:38.580 --> 16:40.046
Who brought it?

16:40.082 --> 16:41.014
I did.

16:41.049 --> 16:43.116
Were you inebriated?

16:43.152 --> 16:44.518
I mean, everybody was.

16:44.553 --> 16:46.653
Were you?

16:46.688 --> 16:48.021
I had some, yeah.

16:48.056 --> 16:50.891
At any point,
were you alone with a girl?

16:50.926 --> 16:52.325
A couple of times, yeah.

16:52.361 --> 16:54.394
Did you have sex
with any of them?

16:56.198 --> 16:57.130
One of them.

16:57.166 --> 17:00.167
Her name?
Val.

17:00.202 --> 17:02.903
What did i tell you
about that girl? Huh?
Terri.

17:02.938 --> 17:05.739
Was the encounter
consensual?

17:05.773 --> 17:07.207
I guess.

17:07.242 --> 17:08.775
What kind of sex was it?

17:08.810 --> 17:10.743
Was it oral, vaginal?

17:11.780 --> 17:12.878
Yeah.

17:12.915 --> 17:14.314
"yeah"?
"yeah," what?

17:14.348 --> 17:15.882
both.

17:15.917 --> 17:17.884
And where did you have
intercourse?

17:19.555 --> 17:20.854
A bathroom.

17:20.888 --> 17:23.423
You screwed that girl
on the bathroom floor, kevin?

17:23.458 --> 17:26.292
And you're sure
that it was consensual?

17:26.328 --> 17:28.161
She, uh...

17:28.196 --> 17:30.030
Yeah, it's...

17:30.065 --> 17:31.698
There's, like,
this thing at the party.

17:31.733 --> 17:33.233
It's, um...
It's like a tradition.

17:33.268 --> 17:36.870
Everybody calls it
"making the team."

17:36.905 --> 17:38.805
And, um, you know,
if you're a senior,

17:38.840 --> 17:42.876
You go in there to hook up,
basically, and...

17:42.911 --> 17:43.977
You know,
girls go in there to...

17:44.012 --> 17:45.512
To "make the team."

17:45.547 --> 17:47.314
So that's what the party
was about -- having sex?

17:47.349 --> 17:48.448
And the hazing?

17:48.483 --> 17:49.783
There were some pictures
that were sent around --

17:49.818 --> 17:50.784
No, i didn't have anything
to do with that.

17:50.819 --> 17:52.085
I was with val.

17:52.120 --> 17:53.486
So, what are
they gonna charge him with?

17:53.522 --> 17:54.854
Well, if kevin is arr--
am i going to jail, man?

17:54.890 --> 17:57.023
If kevin is arrested,

17:57.059 --> 17:58.725
If charges are filed,

17:58.760 --> 18:00.727
Sexual battery is serious.

18:00.762 --> 18:02.829
That coupled
with a controlled substance

18:02.864 --> 18:04.664
Used to incapacitate
the victim --

18:04.700 --> 18:06.166
That's a level 5 felony,

18:06.201 --> 18:08.902
Punishable by up to six years
in prison.

18:10.005 --> 18:11.838
Look,
i-i didn't do anything, man!

18:11.873 --> 18:13.273
Stop it. Stop it!
I didn't touch anybody!

18:13.308 --> 18:14.841
So the article
doesn't specifically say

18:14.876 --> 18:16.810
That kevin is being investigated
for sexual assault.

18:16.845 --> 18:18.044
The article
is just an article.

18:18.080 --> 18:19.512
That's not what we need
to worry about.

18:19.548 --> 18:21.414
So then why
did they call him out?

18:21.450 --> 18:22.549
Kevin's 18.

18:22.584 --> 18:24.551
Legally, he's an adult.
They can print his name.

18:24.586 --> 18:27.387
He's two or three months older
than the other kids,

18:27.422 --> 18:28.588
So they call him out?

18:28.624 --> 18:31.825
Do you know what they are saying
about him online?

18:31.860 --> 18:34.160
Black, drugs, rape.

18:34.196 --> 18:35.762
What do you think
they're saying, rob?

18:35.797 --> 18:37.764
The police have not tried
to make contact.

18:37.799 --> 18:39.866
Clearly, they don't have
anything actionable.

18:39.901 --> 18:41.034
I think the best thing for us

18:41.069 --> 18:42.869
Is just stay silent
and don't talk about it.

18:42.904 --> 18:44.337
stay silent?

18:44.373 --> 18:45.639
No, we're not
gonna say nothing.

18:45.674 --> 18:48.108
Anything that you say in public,
even in support of kevin,

18:48.143 --> 18:49.576
Can make matters worse.

18:49.611 --> 18:52.912
We'll find out what we can,
and we'll deal with it.
Mnh-mnh.

18:52.948 --> 18:57.951
You all have nothing
but friends and supporters
backing you here.

18:57.986 --> 19:01.454
No one believes
any of this crap --

19:01.490 --> 19:03.123
No one who matters.

19:12.318 --> 19:13.517
Nothing?

19:13.553 --> 19:15.820
No, i keep texting him.
He won't hit me back.

19:15.855 --> 19:17.888
All i know, his dad rolled by,
picked him up.

19:17.957 --> 19:18.823
Damn, man.

19:18.858 --> 19:20.124
That party
was messed up, man.

19:20.159 --> 19:21.392
I knew we were
gonna get in trouble.
Shut up.

19:21.427 --> 19:22.393
Look,
i don't need this, okay?

19:22.428 --> 19:23.794
I'm not trying
to go to jail.

19:23.830 --> 19:24.962
Shut up!

19:24.998 --> 19:26.464
What, you think kevin
just disappeared for nothing?

19:26.499 --> 19:27.999
That article's talking
about how it's rape.

19:28.034 --> 19:29.867
Nothing happened at that party
except people acting stupid,

19:29.902 --> 19:31.302
So going on about it
doesn't help anything.

19:31.337 --> 19:33.170
Hey.

19:33.206 --> 19:34.972
He --
he's talking sense, son.

19:35.008 --> 19:37.942
Look, around the way, we don't
say nothing about nothing.

19:37.977 --> 19:39.710
Right?

19:39.746 --> 19:41.212
Yeah. Right.

19:41.247 --> 19:43.114
Okay.
That's what's up.

19:43.149 --> 19:46.284
Look, just keep to yourself,
and it's all good.

19:46.319 --> 19:48.085
We'll be all right.

19:48.121 --> 19:49.086
All right.

19:49.122 --> 19:50.354
all right, man.

19:50.390 --> 19:51.822
Later.
Later, man.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.300
<i>Hey, what up? It's kevin.</i>

20:02.335 --> 20:04.635
<i>Uh, leave a message.
I'll hit you back.</i>

20:06.105 --> 20:07.505
Uh, kevin, it's dan.

20:07.540 --> 20:11.409
Uh, listen,
i saw the article, and, um...

20:11.444 --> 20:13.377
You know, i'm just, uh,
checking on you.

20:13.413 --> 20:15.546
Don't get tired on me.

20:19.485 --> 20:22.687
They told me
your dad picked you up.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.755
Uh...

20:24.791 --> 20:27.858
Well, i just want to make sure
that everything's, uh...

20:29.996 --> 20:31.729
Look, i --
i know things aren't good,

20:31.764 --> 20:35.666
And i just want to make sure
that -- that you're okay.

20:38.104 --> 20:40.871
People are, you know,
saying things, and...

20:40.907 --> 20:43.341
Uh, ignore them.

20:43.376 --> 20:45.343
Here we go.
Game point.

20:47.647 --> 20:48.946
All right? And --
and if you want to --

20:48.981 --> 20:51.816
You want to talk to me,
you just -- you call me, okay?

20:54.420 --> 20:56.354
All right, kev.

21:05.898 --> 21:06.864
Are you good?

21:09.836 --> 21:11.769
look, kevin's fine, man.

21:11.804 --> 21:14.305
No, it's permanent.

21:14.340 --> 21:16.440
You type their names
into google,

21:16.476 --> 21:18.309
Rest of their lives --
rape.

21:18.344 --> 21:19.810
That's all you're gonna see.

21:19.846 --> 21:20.911
Kid's rich.

21:20.947 --> 21:23.614
Doesn't have a damn thing
to worry about.

21:23.649 --> 21:25.249
We need to worry about us.

21:25.284 --> 21:26.984
What about us?

21:27.019 --> 21:28.652
It rolls, man.

21:28.688 --> 21:31.222
Who do you think's gonna get
blamed for these knuckleheads?

21:31.257 --> 21:33.424
Getting drunk,
taking pictures...

21:33.459 --> 21:36.127
Doing whatever else.

21:36.162 --> 21:37.962
Look, you read that article.

21:37.997 --> 21:39.196
"elite school."

21:39.232 --> 21:40.631
"privileged kids."

21:40.666 --> 21:43.033
Th-they're stirring
people up.

21:43.069 --> 21:44.869
And who do you think's
gonna take the hit?

21:44.904 --> 21:48.806
Ah. Well, we got a good
relationship with the school.

21:48.841 --> 21:51.242
Look,
you and me are hired help.

21:51.277 --> 21:53.244
Don't get
to thinking otherwise.

21:53.279 --> 21:54.912
Look,
we're not going anywhere.

21:54.947 --> 21:56.447
You want to bail?
Bail.

21:56.482 --> 21:57.615
All right?

21:57.650 --> 22:01.185
You want to quit?
go for it.

22:01.220 --> 22:05.956
I am not walking
on these kids.

22:23.409 --> 22:25.843
So, then x equals negative 4

22:25.878 --> 22:29.980
Plus or minus the square root
of 16 minus 24 --

22:30.016 --> 22:33.384
Mr. Alejandro?
You have a second, please?

22:38.224 --> 22:40.524
Po-po's comin'
for the brothas.

22:42.195 --> 22:43.594
Nah, they're comin'
to deport your ass.

22:43.629 --> 22:45.763
Ooh!

22:45.798 --> 22:48.432
Hey, settle down.
Quiet.

22:49.902 --> 22:52.303
Evy, could you step outside,
please?

22:57.543 --> 22:59.743
Gonna get it for selling
her melons on the off-ramp.

23:01.581 --> 23:02.947
Evy,
this is detective krasno.

23:02.982 --> 23:06.884
He's asking about
a leyland basketball party.

23:06.919 --> 23:08.452
Were you there?

23:11.224 --> 23:13.023
It's okay, evy.

23:14.827 --> 23:16.260
Yeah, i was there.

23:16.295 --> 23:17.495
Evy,
we have some questions

23:17.530 --> 23:18.929
Regarding a possible
incident that night.

23:18.965 --> 23:20.164
It would be real helpful

23:20.199 --> 23:21.432
If you could come down
to the station with us.

23:21.467 --> 23:24.235
Hold on. You didn't say anything
about taking her anywhere.

23:24.270 --> 23:25.703
Just to ask
some questions.

23:25.738 --> 23:27.705
You don't have to go
anywhere with them.

23:27.740 --> 23:29.640
You don't have to say
anything to them.

23:31.244 --> 23:33.077
You all are going to need
one of her parents

23:33.112 --> 23:34.211
If you want to talk to her.

23:34.247 --> 23:35.579
We really need
to speak to her.

23:35.615 --> 23:37.014
This is a serious
investigation.

23:37.049 --> 23:38.148
You want to ask her things,

23:38.184 --> 23:41.185
It's going to be here,
with a parent.

23:41.220 --> 23:43.287
Otherwise, she's got class.

23:43.322 --> 23:44.822
Where can we wait?

23:47.560 --> 23:48.559
This way.

23:48.594 --> 23:51.095
What time did you get
to the party?

23:51.130 --> 23:53.697
Uh, was maybe after 9:00.

23:53.733 --> 23:56.000
You were with taylor
the whole time?

23:56.035 --> 23:57.334
Pretty much.

23:57.370 --> 23:59.370
But not all the time?

23:59.405 --> 24:01.672
You remember if he ever
left the party with someone?

24:01.707 --> 24:02.740
No.

24:02.775 --> 24:03.741
No, you don't remember,
or, no, he didn't --

24:03.776 --> 24:05.509
No, none of that.

24:05.545 --> 24:07.545
Do you remember who he was
hanging out with?

24:07.580 --> 24:09.179
I don't know those kids.

24:09.215 --> 24:12.449
Did you see taylor
spend any length of time
with a male individual?

24:12.485 --> 24:13.751
I don't get
what you're saying.

24:13.786 --> 24:14.785
Was there an argument?

24:14.820 --> 24:16.120
Did they step away
to another room?

24:16.155 --> 24:18.022
I don't know
what you're asking.

24:18.057 --> 24:19.390
She doesn't know
anything.

24:19.425 --> 24:21.559
She keeps telling you
she doesn't know anything.

24:21.594 --> 24:23.594
We're almost finished, sir.

24:23.629 --> 24:25.930
When did you see taylor
again?

24:25.965 --> 24:28.566
Maybe uh, 1:00, 1:30.

24:28.601 --> 24:30.267
What was his condition?

24:30.303 --> 24:32.469
He was messed up.

24:34.373 --> 24:37.207
He was --
he was more than that.

24:37.243 --> 24:39.577
He couldn't even stand up.

24:39.612 --> 24:44.815
His clothes, they were all...
Half on, something crazy.

24:46.652 --> 24:48.786
Nobody was trying to help him.

24:48.854 --> 24:51.522
People were taking pictures.

24:51.557 --> 24:55.326
This guy on the team --
eric, i think --

24:55.361 --> 24:57.528
He drove us home.

24:57.563 --> 25:00.864
I don't know him,
but he was off about something.

25:02.635 --> 25:04.368
He dropped us.

25:04.403 --> 25:05.836
He didn't even help us
in the house.

25:05.871 --> 25:08.639
He just dumped us on the curb.

25:08.674 --> 25:11.575
Did taylor say anything
to you the next day?

25:11.611 --> 25:13.477
We didn't talk.

25:13.512 --> 25:16.246
I was pissed at him
for taking me to that joint.

25:21.921 --> 25:23.187
Are we done?

25:26.759 --> 25:28.792
I might be in touch.

25:33.399 --> 25:34.932
What up, ma?

25:34.967 --> 25:36.400
Nothing.

25:36.435 --> 25:38.202
Why you getting snatched
out of class like that?

25:38.237 --> 25:39.903
For real,
it was nothing.

25:39.939 --> 25:42.740
Okay.
Just looking out.

25:42.775 --> 25:44.742
I'm good.

25:50.883 --> 25:52.716
Did you see the article?

25:54.086 --> 25:56.487
i hate that place.

25:56.522 --> 25:59.022
We're in debt because of
that school, and for what?

25:59.058 --> 26:02.125
So he can get drunk at parties,
rape girls?

26:02.161 --> 26:04.461
Eric's grades are good.
He's doing great on the team.

26:04.497 --> 26:05.996
Well, i heard him
talking on the phone.

26:06.031 --> 26:07.331
It was "bitch" this,
"whore" that.

26:07.366 --> 26:08.632
I-i don't even
know him anymore.

26:08.667 --> 26:09.800
He's a teenaged boy --

26:09.835 --> 26:11.368
Stop making excuses
for him.

26:11.403 --> 26:14.738
He's been different ever since
he started going there.

26:14.773 --> 26:16.273
Okay.

26:16.308 --> 26:17.774
"okay," what?

26:17.810 --> 26:20.978
I am just tired
of fighting with you.

26:21.013 --> 26:23.747
So, okay.
Whatever you say.

26:24.683 --> 26:26.583
All that bitch does
is yell.

26:26.619 --> 26:28.719
Do not talk
about mom like that.

26:28.754 --> 26:29.653
She does.

26:29.688 --> 26:32.022
That's all she does
is scream.

26:32.057 --> 26:34.525
She's, like, crazy.

26:34.560 --> 26:36.293
Telling you,
i don't let none of my girls--

26:36.328 --> 26:38.562
What?
"your girls"?

26:38.597 --> 26:40.797
I got girls.

26:40.833 --> 26:42.165
Let me see some pictures.

26:42.201 --> 26:43.333
I don't take pictures.

26:43.369 --> 26:44.668
I'm not a freak like you.

26:44.703 --> 26:47.538
Yeah, yeah.
Eat your food, cool jack.

26:49.742 --> 26:51.608
How's school?

26:51.644 --> 26:53.577
Public school bites.

26:53.612 --> 26:54.745
It's like a jungle.

26:54.780 --> 26:57.214
I want to go to leyland.

26:57.249 --> 26:59.049
Then you shouldn't suck so bad
at basketball.

26:59.084 --> 27:00.017
I'm serious.

27:00.052 --> 27:01.652
I want to go to leyland.

27:01.687 --> 27:03.220
Then we could hang out.

27:03.255 --> 27:05.255
We hang out now.

27:07.126 --> 27:08.992
It's not the same.

27:14.433 --> 27:18.402
Look, in public school,
they got the best bitches.

27:18.437 --> 27:19.403
All right?

27:19.438 --> 27:21.038
They got latinas,
black, asian...

27:21.073 --> 27:23.740
All they got at leyland
is the pasty white girls.

27:23.776 --> 27:25.208
Yeah?
Yeah.

27:25.244 --> 27:27.177
And asian girls
are the best babies anyhow.

27:27.212 --> 27:29.746
Don't see a good-looking
asian baby.

27:29.782 --> 27:31.982
Should be glad
you're there.

27:34.153 --> 27:36.954
Eat your food.
We'll go shoot some buckets.

27:47.433 --> 27:50.367
Dr. Lewis is --
she's well-intentioned.

27:50.402 --> 27:52.269
She tries
to do right.

27:52.304 --> 27:55.005
Hmm. She's got the same
wind-up about you.

27:55.040 --> 27:57.474
Yeah, i'm sure.

27:57.509 --> 27:59.810
"well-intentioned, but she
doesn't know what she's doing"?

27:59.845 --> 28:03.146
"well-intentioned, but a little
too socially indulgent."

28:03.182 --> 28:05.916
Well,
if i'm indulgent, she's...

28:05.951 --> 28:07.351
I know she's your friend.

28:07.386 --> 28:08.719
She's our superintendent.

28:08.754 --> 28:11.722
Her perspective
doesn't reflect new realities.

28:11.757 --> 28:13.657
Look, things got heated
in the district meeting --

28:13.692 --> 28:15.225
You don't have to apologize.
I'm not.

28:15.260 --> 28:17.494
I'm just saying,
this is an opportunity

28:17.529 --> 28:18.929
For us to talk one on one.

28:20.566 --> 28:22.099
Okay.

28:22.134 --> 28:24.501
I know dr. Lewis wants you
to speak against hhfk --

28:24.536 --> 28:25.335
Not against it.

28:25.371 --> 28:26.770
About how it's being
implemented.

28:26.805 --> 28:28.205
That's what
i'm talking about.

28:28.240 --> 28:31.074
She can't see that
the breakfast program hurts kids

28:31.110 --> 28:32.876
Because the kids she's hurting
are hispanic.

28:32.911 --> 28:34.244
You saying she's racist?

28:34.279 --> 28:36.847
Hispanic kids are the ones who
are gonna be the most affected.

28:36.882 --> 28:38.015
If it were black kids,

28:38.050 --> 28:40.450
Yeah, i think she would
see things differently.

28:40.486 --> 28:42.052
So, i don't support you,
i'm a racist.

28:42.087 --> 28:43.387
Black people
can't be racist?

28:43.422 --> 28:45.389
"racist" and "black people"
in the same sentence?

28:45.424 --> 28:46.857
You keep saying that word,
not me.

28:46.892 --> 28:49.059
People have blind spots.

28:49.094 --> 28:51.528
I'm just trying
to help you see yours.

28:56.035 --> 28:58.135
That doesn't
make me japanese.

28:59.605 --> 29:01.004
If we don't
get ourselves together,

29:01.040 --> 29:03.106
We don't quit this infighting,
they're gonna charter us.

29:03.142 --> 29:04.307
Everything's an agenda?

29:04.343 --> 29:06.143
Are they busting the union
or not?

29:06.178 --> 29:07.878
Are they gutting education?

29:09.014 --> 29:09.980
Don't give them excuses.

29:10.015 --> 29:11.314
I can't talk about this.

29:11.350 --> 29:13.717
I -- i don't want
to talk about this.

29:15.954 --> 29:17.621
Okay.

29:19.391 --> 29:21.992
Y-you're leaving?

29:22.027 --> 29:24.094
Well,
you don't want to talk.

29:27.199 --> 29:30.000
Y-you don't want to have
something to eat?

29:31.637 --> 29:34.037
Did you think
this was gonna be social?

29:41.780 --> 29:43.814
Sure, i -- yeah.

29:43.849 --> 29:46.083
I'm actually hungry.

29:50.089 --> 29:52.189
So, what's good?

29:53.525 --> 29:55.158
The tofu sandwich
is pretty good.

29:55.194 --> 29:56.993
I don't eat tofu.

30:14.713 --> 30:16.446
Hello?

30:16.482 --> 30:18.949
Hey. It's nikki.

30:20.385 --> 30:21.918
Hey.

30:28.026 --> 30:29.826
You okay?

30:35.334 --> 30:38.235
Kevin?

30:38.270 --> 30:40.137
i'm scared.

30:42.241 --> 30:44.775
You want me to come over?

30:49.014 --> 30:50.046
Kevin?

30:50.082 --> 30:51.948
No, i'm okay.

30:55.187 --> 30:59.089
If you want me to come over
or something, text me, okay?

30:59.124 --> 31:00.690
Yeah.

31:01.727 --> 31:03.493
Okay.

31:03.529 --> 31:06.296
Talk to you later.

31:36.228 --> 31:37.361
Okay.
What about that one?

31:37.396 --> 31:38.862
No.
That's a group photo.

31:38.898 --> 31:41.999
Can't you just erase her?

31:42.034 --> 31:45.035
Well, taking your daughter
out of these photos --

31:45.070 --> 31:47.237
It's --
it's not that easy.

31:47.273 --> 31:48.639
I read that article online.

31:48.674 --> 31:50.340
Made it sound
like these girls

31:50.376 --> 31:52.743
Just walk around all day
giving out hand jobs.

31:52.778 --> 31:56.680
I don't want my daughter
on this school's website.

31:56.715 --> 31:58.415
Well,
this is a group picture.

31:58.450 --> 32:00.984
I mean,
she might feel left out.

32:01.020 --> 32:03.320
Left out of people thinking
she's a slut?

32:03.355 --> 32:05.789
We pay good money
to send her here.

32:05.824 --> 32:07.324
She doesn't need that.

32:09.795 --> 32:12.863
Well, it's gonna take
a little time.

32:12.898 --> 32:14.665
I'll wait.

32:16.468 --> 32:19.136
So, she stood over me
for an hour.

32:19.171 --> 32:21.672
I mean, who does that?

32:21.707 --> 32:23.340
Everybody's frustrated.

32:23.375 --> 32:25.342
Well, i think she thinks
her daughter's a ho

32:25.377 --> 32:27.044
And that's why
she wanted her picture

32:27.079 --> 32:28.278
Taken off the page so fast.

32:28.314 --> 32:30.847
She probably
already has a rep.
Mm.

32:30.883 --> 32:31.982
It was a bad day.

32:32.017 --> 32:33.817
I guess, just,
you know, chalk it up to that.

32:33.852 --> 32:35.786
That article --
that is --

32:35.821 --> 32:37.955
It is really stirring something,
i'm telling you.

32:37.990 --> 32:38.789
I know.

32:38.824 --> 32:40.157
You know, kevin --

32:40.192 --> 32:42.359
You know, he still
hasn't called me back yet.

32:42.394 --> 32:44.795
I'm worried.

32:44.830 --> 32:46.396
C-can you not do that?

32:46.432 --> 32:47.464
What?

32:47.499 --> 32:51.468
Just steer the conversation
to your boys.

32:51.503 --> 32:54.304
I'm trying to tell you
about how i got dumped on today.

32:54.340 --> 32:55.739
I know you are.
Can you please just listen?

32:55.774 --> 32:56.740
I-i know.

32:56.775 --> 32:58.609
Do you have to redirect?

33:05.117 --> 33:06.650
I'm -- i'm --

33:06.685 --> 33:09.252
I'm stressed.
I-i need to relax.

33:09.288 --> 33:11.855
Yep.
Relax or "chill?"

33:13.158 --> 33:14.257
What?

33:17.429 --> 33:19.096
you know, i mean...

33:19.131 --> 33:21.131
It started off casual,

33:21.166 --> 33:23.934
But now you're on
the pot candy every day.

33:25.471 --> 33:26.870
You started that.

33:26.905 --> 33:28.271
What?

33:28.307 --> 33:31.975
Yeah, on our six--
our seventh date --

33:32.011 --> 33:33.844
What was the song
that you would always put on?

33:33.879 --> 33:34.845
"reasons."

33:34.880 --> 33:36.413
Oh, god.
So cheesy.

33:36.448 --> 33:38.615
Oh, no, no, no, no.
That's the opposite of cheese.

33:38.651 --> 33:43.220
And you talked me
into smoking a joint...

33:43.255 --> 33:45.288
Because you said
the sex would be better.

33:45.324 --> 33:49.559
Yeah, well...
Because it is.

33:49.595 --> 33:53.697
Well, you ought to think
about partaking again.

33:55.167 --> 33:57.467
The school drug tests me.

33:57.503 --> 33:58.502
I mean --
i know.

33:58.537 --> 34:00.237
No, but,
how would that look?

34:00.272 --> 34:03.573
I come up positive
in the middle of all this?

34:03.609 --> 34:04.608
Yeah, i know.

34:04.643 --> 34:06.109
Just...

34:06.145 --> 34:08.045
There used to be signs.

34:08.080 --> 34:09.246
You know, you would --

34:09.281 --> 34:11.648
You would put on
your corny music or roll a joint

34:11.684 --> 34:13.817
Or there'd be
a bottle of red.

34:16.188 --> 34:20.056
Have the signs changed,
or am i missing them?

34:20.092 --> 34:22.458
Things change, yeah.

34:24.730 --> 34:26.897
But you still got it.

34:36.507 --> 34:38.574
Well, i'm going up to bed.

34:40.079 --> 34:42.179
I'll probably be up
for a while.

34:44.750 --> 34:46.315
Okay.

35:07.406 --> 35:09.372
The cops pulled me
out of class today.

35:09.408 --> 35:12.309
They were asking
about the party.

35:13.479 --> 35:15.011
What did you tell them?

35:15.047 --> 35:17.681
<i>So you're not gonna ask
how i'm doing?</i>

35:20.319 --> 35:21.818
look, whatever.

35:21.854 --> 35:23.587
I got enough going on
with my mom.

35:23.622 --> 35:25.155
My dad had
to leave work early,

35:25.190 --> 35:26.890
So now his check's
gonna be short.

35:26.925 --> 35:28.925
I don't need that.

35:31.396 --> 35:34.131
Cops kept pressing me
about you and a guy.

35:34.166 --> 35:37.033
What, did you get in a fight
or something?

35:37.069 --> 35:38.101
No.

35:38.137 --> 35:39.302
Then, what?

35:39.338 --> 35:41.338
My mom's just making a big deal
about those pictures.

35:41.373 --> 35:44.608
The cop wasn't asking
about pictures.

35:45.978 --> 35:47.944
Where did you go
at the party?

35:47.980 --> 35:48.945
I was just hanging.

35:48.981 --> 35:51.815
Hanging where?
I couldn't find you.

35:55.154 --> 35:57.053
You got me lying
to your mom,

35:57.089 --> 35:59.055
And now i got to deal
with the cops,

35:59.091 --> 36:01.458
Just so you could hang out
with the rich kids?

36:02.494 --> 36:04.394
That school
made you different.

36:10.235 --> 36:11.668
Just come back
to marshall.

36:11.703 --> 36:13.470
My mom wants me to stay
at leyland.

36:13.505 --> 36:15.372
You know what?
It's not all about her.

36:15.407 --> 36:17.040
You need
to take care of you

36:17.075 --> 36:20.110
And stop acting
like she's gonna fall apart.

36:20.145 --> 36:21.278
I'm not.

36:21.313 --> 36:24.748
Well, you're not the one
who screwed up.

36:24.783 --> 36:26.883
She is your mom.

36:26.919 --> 36:29.119
She made her choice.

36:35.777 --> 36:37.143
The case is being worked
outside of my division,

36:37.179 --> 36:38.244
So i don't have
a whole lot of info.

36:38.280 --> 36:39.445
On the sexual assault,

36:39.481 --> 36:41.347
The blood work came back
negative.

36:41.383 --> 36:43.817
There were no traces of ghb
in his bloodstream.

36:43.852 --> 36:47.187
"his"?
Kevin's?

36:47.222 --> 36:50.356
The person making the
sexual-assault claim is a boy --

36:50.392 --> 36:52.692
The same boy
that was hazed.

36:52.727 --> 36:54.661
The boy's saying
he was raped?

36:54.696 --> 36:56.029
What, like, gang rape?

36:56.064 --> 36:58.231
From what i know,
there was one alleged perp.

36:58.266 --> 36:59.966
S-so, they're saying
kevin did this?

37:00.001 --> 37:02.202
It's with sex crimes.
They're being tight on this.

37:02.237 --> 37:04.270
But, no,
th-that didn't happen.

37:04.306 --> 37:07.240
It didn't happen
because boys don't get raped.

37:08.610 --> 37:09.576
First of all,

37:09.611 --> 37:11.978
Boys don't do that
to other boys.

37:12.013 --> 37:15.415
And even if he could...

37:15.450 --> 37:16.549
The boys fight back.

37:16.585 --> 37:18.618
Wait. Are they even
taking this seriously?

37:18.653 --> 37:21.154
The accuser's
not looking too good.

37:21.189 --> 37:22.188
No ghb,

37:22.224 --> 37:24.691
Pictures of him drunk
don't help at all.

37:31.633 --> 37:33.299
Did you touch that boy?!
What?

37:33.335 --> 37:34.901
At the party,
did you touch some boy?!

37:34.936 --> 37:36.436
No! No!
I did not!

37:36.471 --> 37:38.538
Did you put a hand on him?!
No, i was with val!

37:38.573 --> 37:40.006
That was it, dad!
Nothing else!

37:40.041 --> 37:42.141
Nothing!

38:01.963 --> 38:05.331
Sexual assault is the
hardest crime to prosecute.

38:05.367 --> 38:08.301
Most times, these investigations
don't go forward.

38:08.336 --> 38:09.369
They just don't.

38:09.404 --> 38:11.471
Well,
anything you find out,

38:11.506 --> 38:13.940
Or anything you know,
you tell us.

38:18.947 --> 38:22.215
Can't you do anything
for us?

38:38.366 --> 38:40.833
How was dr. Esposito?

38:40.869 --> 38:42.669
I don't want
to talk about it.

38:42.704 --> 38:44.904
Well,
i wasn't asking...

38:44.940 --> 38:47.774
I was -- i just...

38:47.842 --> 38:49.709
Was it helpful?

38:52.547 --> 38:54.580
He said i should...

38:54.616 --> 38:57.684
Be honest with you
with how i feel.

38:57.719 --> 39:00.787
You should.

39:05.327 --> 39:06.492
Evy came by today.

39:06.528 --> 39:08.094
She's, um -- she's pissed

39:08.129 --> 39:11.030
Because the police
are showing up at her school.

39:11.066 --> 39:12.932
They had to talk to her.
She was at the party.

39:12.968 --> 39:14.367
You said that thing in the paper
would help.

39:14.402 --> 39:16.035
People know it's me.
They can figure it out.

39:16.071 --> 39:17.937
They're -- they're going online,
they're saying stuff.

39:17.973 --> 39:19.138
I told you to stay off --

39:19.174 --> 39:21.040
Look, i didn't want to do this
in the first place.

39:21.076 --> 39:22.675
It's why i don't
tell you things...
I -- look.

39:22.711 --> 39:24.844
...'cause you won't
let me go.
I only --
i was just trying --

39:24.879 --> 39:26.145
You're on this guilt trip.

39:27.849 --> 39:30.783
Is that what you
and dr. Esposito talked about?

39:30.819 --> 39:34.520
We talked about me doing...

39:34.556 --> 39:37.390
What's right for me.

39:37.425 --> 39:40.226
So i...

39:40.261 --> 39:42.495
I don't want to deal
with the police.

39:42.530 --> 39:46.132
I...

39:46.167 --> 39:47.633
I don't want
to go to leyland anymore.

39:47.669 --> 39:48.935
I want to go
back to marshall.

39:48.970 --> 39:51.004
I just want it to be over.

39:59.314 --> 40:01.547
Will you keep going
to counseling?

40:01.583 --> 40:03.850
Can you promise me that?

40:03.885 --> 40:07.120
If you won't talk to me,
i want you talking to somebody.

40:12.193 --> 40:13.393
Yeah.

40:42.857 --> 40:45.391
I want to do absolutely
everything i can to help.

40:45.427 --> 40:46.759
I appreciate that.

40:46.795 --> 40:48.861
But you understand,
we're balancing that

40:48.897 --> 40:51.497
With the privacy of our students
and their families.

40:51.533 --> 40:53.733
That article didn't
make our job any easier.

40:53.768 --> 40:55.735
So, to do
what we need to do,

40:55.770 --> 40:57.770
To do it in a way
that's the least disruptive,

40:57.806 --> 40:59.338
I need your help generating

40:59.374 --> 41:01.774
A list of males
who were at that party.

41:01.810 --> 41:02.909
For what reason?

41:02.944 --> 41:05.144
We'll be issuing warrants
to these individuals

41:05.180 --> 41:05.978
For dna samples.

41:06.014 --> 41:07.313
If we can't get a list,

41:07.348 --> 41:09.916
We'll have to subpoena
every student in this school.

41:11.186 --> 41:13.386
We're not gonna help you
harass our families,

41:13.421 --> 41:16.622
Not over some lurid story
from a young man who got drunk.

41:16.658 --> 41:19.625
The testing's come back
from taylor blaine's clothes.

41:19.661 --> 41:22.628
We found semen belonging
to another individual.

41:22.664 --> 41:26.165
Someone ejaculated
on mr. Blaine.

41:26.201 --> 41:29.836
We also found traces of blood,
indicating forced contact.
