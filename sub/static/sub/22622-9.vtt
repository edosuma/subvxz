41:11.633 --> 41:15.900
IN THE CABIN.

41:15.900 --> 41:20.433
AND, OF COURSE, I DIDN'T KNOW

41:15.900 --> 41:20.433
ANY OF THIS WHEN I BOUGHT IT.

41:20.433 --> 41:24.667
**

41:24.667 --> 41:28.967
**

41:28.967 --> 41:33.200
**

41:33.200 --> 41:37.467
**

41:37.467 --> 41:41.700
**

41:41.700 --> 41:45.933
[ DISTANT SCREAM ]

41:45.933 --> 41:48.433
Charisse: YOU DON'T FEEL SAFE

41:45.933 --> 41:48.433
GETTING OFF YOUR FRONT PORCH

41:48.433 --> 41:50.667
AT NIGHT WITHOUT HAVING

41:48.433 --> 41:50.667
SOME SORT OF WEAPON ON YOU,

41:50.667 --> 41:53.767
AND THAT'S NOT ONLY JUST BECAUSE

41:50.667 --> 41:53.767
OF THE NATURAL DANGERS

41:53.767 --> 41:55.433
OF BEING IN THE FOREST.

41:55.433 --> 41:58.800
YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT

41:55.433 --> 41:58.800
COULD BE OUT THERE.

41:58.800 --> 42:02.400
**

42:02.400 --> 42:05.367
YOU KNOW, NOW THAT I HAVE

42:02.400 --> 42:05.367
EXPERIENCED WHAT I CONSIDER

42:05.367 --> 42:07.767
TO BE SERIOUS

42:05.367 --> 42:07.767
PARANORMAL ACTIVITY --

42:07.767 --> 42:10.833
I MEAN, I'VE LOOKED AT ALL

42:07.767 --> 42:10.833
THE EVIDENCE ONLINE.

42:10.833 --> 42:12.433
I'VE LOOKED AT ALL THE SHOWS.

42:12.433 --> 42:15.067
I'VE DEBUNKED EVERYTHING

42:12.433 --> 42:15.067
THAT I CAN.

42:15.067 --> 42:17.700
I'VE GONE FROM A SKEPTIC

42:15.067 --> 42:17.700
TO TRYING TO JUSTIFY

42:17.700 --> 42:19.800
ALL THESE EVENTS.

42:19.800 --> 42:22.700
OH, I PROBABLY WOULDN'T

42:19.800 --> 42:22.700
STAY THERE BY MYSELF.

42:22.700 --> 42:27.567
AND I DO WONDER SOMETIMES

42:22.700 --> 42:27.567
IF -- IF, YOU KNOW --

42:27.567 --> 42:30.300
IF BILL WERE TO GO BEFORE I DO,

42:30.300 --> 42:33.167
HOW LATE I WOULD LIVE

42:30.300 --> 42:33.167
MY RETIREMENT YEARS

42:33.167 --> 42:35.400
OUT THERE BY MYSELF. YEAH.

42:35.400 --> 42:38.400
**

42:38.400 --> 42:41.533
A PLACE IN A REMOTE AREA

42:41.533 --> 42:44.167
WHERE THEY CAN GO AWAY

42:41.533 --> 42:44.167
AND GET AWAY FROM IT ALL,

42:44.167 --> 42:46.600
BUT BE CAREFUL

42:44.167 --> 42:46.600
WHAT YOU WISH FOR.

42:46.600 --> 42:48.133
BE VERY CAREFUL.

42:48.133 --> 42:49.567
THERE'S SOMETHING OUT THERE --

42:49.567 --> 42:51.833
I'M TELLING YOU --

42:49.567 --> 42:51.833
I KNOW THERE IS.

42:51.833 --> 42:55.133
