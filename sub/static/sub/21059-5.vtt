"TURN: Washington's Spies"...</i>

00:03.586 --> 00:06.155
You used your Molly friend
to manipulate me!

00:06.157 --> 00:08.357
I have given you everything of me!

00:09.693 --> 00:12.794
My dearest Selah,
we need someone from Congress.

00:12.796 --> 00:16.189
I've authorized Benedict Arnold
to raise a legion of loyalists.

00:16.189 --> 00:17.821
You're orders are to follow his.

00:17.823 --> 00:19.223
Simcoe knows your cover.

00:19.225 --> 00:20.824
What could possibly be more important

00:20.826 --> 00:22.192
than putting a knife into him?

00:22.194 --> 00:24.962
Arnold... He wants him just
as bad as you want Simcoe.

00:24.964 --> 00:26.463
Woodhull lost his father.

00:26.465 --> 00:29.833
That makes him the perfect man
to volunteer for Arnold's unit.

<i>What's your business in New York?</i>

00:40.912 --> 00:43.712
My business is with Benedict Arnold.

00:43.748 --> 00:46.983
You wouldn't happen to know
where the American Legion

00:47.018 --> 00:49.018
is recruiting, would you?

00:54.524 --> 00:55.893
What's your name again?

00:55.929 --> 00:57.558
Woodheel?

00:58.136 --> 00:59.560
Woodfall!

01:01.131 --> 01:02.798
Woodhull.

01:07.237 --> 01:09.203
Not Woodhull from Long Island?

01:09.238 --> 01:11.205
The magistrate's son?

01:16.652 --> 01:18.719
Well, I'm very sorry for your loss.

01:23.810 --> 01:25.575
Any idea of the rebels behind it?

01:25.611 --> 01:27.044
Dead men walking.

01:27.079 --> 01:29.813
This outfit best of the best.

01:29.849 --> 01:31.381
You're a farmer, correct?

01:31.416 --> 01:33.617
I've been growing the crops
that feed our army, sir.

01:34.165 --> 01:36.453
Yes, and we are indebted to you for it.

01:36.488 --> 01:38.355
But we're only taking men who've served.

01:41.693 --> 01:44.127
General, I can handle a musket
as well as the next man.

01:44.162 --> 01:45.828
I don't have time
to turn you into an officer.

01:45.864 --> 01:47.864
Go off at half-cock,
you'll get yourself killed.

01:47.899 --> 01:50.133
I don't want to be an officer.
I just want the chance to fight.

01:52.236 --> 01:54.702
I was ambushed by men
who meant to burn me alive.

01:55.172 --> 01:58.507
And Providence spared me so that
I could stand before you today.

02:00.844 --> 02:02.329
And seek revenge.

02:08.585 --> 02:10.217
And you shall have it.

Are we there yet?

03:28.818 --> 03:30.184
We've nearly reached camp.

03:30.220 --> 03:31.885
Isn't that right, Mr. Brewster?

03:39.194 --> 03:41.680
You don't still harbor
ill will toward me

03:42.498 --> 03:45.332
back when I sent the Rangers
toward your boat?

03:49.304 --> 03:50.437
I had to make a choice,

03:50.472 --> 03:52.282
and I chose to save my husband from...

03:52.318 --> 03:53.705
Simcoe.

03:56.277 --> 03:58.444
Saw you got a piece of his ear.

04:00.481 --> 04:02.748
You got closer than any of us.

04:20.966 --> 04:22.579
Welcome to New Windsor.

04:23.770 --> 04:25.290
Major Tallmadge.

04:25.672 --> 04:27.125
Mrs. Strong.

04:27.806 --> 04:30.006
Your husband has sacrificed
much for our cause.

04:30.042 --> 04:32.108
- You both have.
- The least that I can do

04:32.144 --> 04:33.810
is see that you're protected
and well cared for.

04:33.845 --> 04:35.132
If there's anything that you require,

04:35.167 --> 04:37.636
please don't hesitate to call upon me.

04:39.051 --> 04:40.950
<i>Anna will take you the rest
of the way into the camp.</i>

04:40.986 --> 04:42.085
<i>It'll be safer that way.</i>

04:42.120 --> 04:44.320
- Safer?
- For Abraham.

04:44.355 --> 04:46.121
If you were to be seen
with Ben or Caleb,

04:46.157 --> 04:47.190
it might raise questions.

04:47.225 --> 04:49.024
<i>We need to take precautions.</i>

04:49.060 --> 04:50.993
Now, you won't be able
to speak about your husband

04:51.028 --> 04:52.662
- or about his mission.
- Of course not.

04:52.697 --> 04:54.930
And you can't use your surname anymore.

04:54.965 --> 04:57.766
<i>"Woodhull" is linked
with the Tory character.</i>

04:57.802 --> 04:59.868
Anna's had to fabricate
an account of her being here.

04:59.904 --> 05:01.769
She'll help you craft one of your own.

05:04.074 --> 05:05.440
When Woody was in camp,

05:05.475 --> 05:07.309
they wouldn't even let him
out the barn, so.

05:15.085 --> 05:17.300
Oh, well, what have you got there?

05:18.188 --> 05:19.920
Ah.

05:22.157 --> 05:24.925
Your father and I,
we used to play with these.

05:31.834 --> 05:34.776
This is your Brown Bess.

05:35.237 --> 05:38.438
She's loud, she's flinty,

05:38.473 --> 05:40.640
and you never know
if she'll go off or not.

05:40.675 --> 05:42.475
Didn't have to leave home for that.

05:44.746 --> 05:47.380
Don't think of it as a musket.

05:47.415 --> 05:51.016
Think of it as a spear that shoots.

05:51.052 --> 05:53.719
<i>'Cause your bayonet will never fail you.</i>

06:21.080 --> 06:23.347
<i>Private Woodhull!</i>

06:23.383 --> 06:25.182
<i>Don't stroke it like your pego.</i>

06:28.453 --> 06:30.887
<i> Halt!</i>

06:30.922 --> 06:34.791
Beyond there is the army itself.

06:34.826 --> 06:36.838
You must stay to this side.

06:38.131 --> 06:40.330
How do you go back and forth?

06:42.668 --> 06:44.763
Don't you live here as well?

06:45.369 --> 06:48.304
Uh, I have a foot in both camps.

06:52.810 --> 06:55.315
I know it's a far cry from wh...

06:55.813 --> 06:58.547
from what you're accustomed to.

07:00.417 --> 07:02.216
It's a roof over our heads.

07:03.949 --> 07:05.152
Mostly.

07:05.188 --> 07:08.189
The woman who used to live
here was drummed out of camp.

07:08.224 --> 07:10.425
She wasn't a... you know, a...

07:10.460 --> 07:13.628
A whore? No.

07:13.663 --> 07:16.564
The whores around here
get paid for their troubles.

07:16.599 --> 07:18.164
If there's provisions you lack,

07:18.200 --> 07:19.800
<i>I'll procure them
from the sutler's cart.</i>

07:19.835 --> 07:22.235
Ain't you going to introduce us?

07:23.339 --> 07:25.905
Uh, Mary, this is Mrs. Barnes.

07:25.941 --> 07:27.307
Ann Barnes.

07:27.343 --> 07:28.809
And you're Mary...?

07:30.946 --> 07:34.980
Smith. Mary Smith, from Suffolk County.

07:35.538 --> 07:39.151
And this is my boy, Thomas.

07:40.688 --> 07:44.089
Hello, Thomas. Welcome.

07:47.228 --> 07:50.496
If you haven't got
a bunkmate, find a few.

07:50.531 --> 07:53.582
- Three to a berth.
- We're tripling up?

07:54.234 --> 07:56.601
It's tighter than a nun's gash.

07:57.838 --> 07:59.904
I know a mattress
is too much to hope for,

07:59.939 --> 08:01.906
but not even a bit of straw?

08:01.941 --> 08:03.466
Take it up with the rebels.

08:04.043 --> 08:06.110
<i>They're the ones who burned all the hay.</i>

08:11.083 --> 08:13.817
You know, a friend of mine, a sailor,

08:13.853 --> 08:16.620
says the best place to rest
your head is the softest plank.

08:16.655 --> 08:18.154
That supposed to be comforting?

08:20.092 --> 08:22.493
You willing to be my fart catcher?

08:24.797 --> 08:26.156
Well...

08:27.298 --> 08:28.998
when you put it that way...

08:29.033 --> 08:30.966
Joseph Sturridge at your service.

08:31.002 --> 08:32.602
Abraham Woodhull.

08:32.636 --> 08:34.669
So, what brings you here, Woodhull?

08:34.706 --> 08:36.639
King, country,

08:36.674 --> 08:38.941
three-guineas bounty,
and eightpence a day.

08:40.611 --> 08:43.544
If you don't want to
tell me, just say so.

08:45.048 --> 08:46.848
You care why I'm here?

08:47.510 --> 08:49.117
Well, I'm gonna tell you anyway.

08:49.152 --> 08:51.252
Old man couldn't make it
into the Regulars,

08:51.288 --> 08:54.556
<i>so he settled for being a
sapper in the New York militia.</i>

08:56.259 --> 08:59.727
Ever since the war started,
he's been prodding me to enlist.

09:01.230 --> 09:04.298
<i>Finally, swears to disown
me unless I join up.</i>

09:04.333 --> 09:06.801
So I chose the safest option.

09:06.836 --> 09:08.736
You think this is the safest option?

09:08.771 --> 09:13.441
Word is the junior officers hate Arnold.

09:13.476 --> 09:16.376
The higher-ups don't trust him.

09:16.412 --> 09:19.512
We're never going to see battle.

09:21.115 --> 09:23.015
Ah, eightpence a day

09:23.051 --> 09:26.553
for a lot of sentry duty and drilling.

09:26.588 --> 09:28.220
Not bad.

09:28.256 --> 09:30.256
<i> Step!</i>

09:30.291 --> 09:31.891
<i>Step!</i>

09:31.927 --> 09:33.192
<i>Step!</i>

09:33.227 --> 09:35.293
To the front, march!

09:35.329 --> 09:37.696
Step! Step!

09:37.731 --> 09:39.832
Left turn, march!

09:42.035 --> 09:45.068
Halt! Halt!!

09:45.405 --> 09:47.539
Best of the best,
or the best of what's left?

09:47.575 --> 09:49.875
You cloven-hoofed clodhoppers!

09:49.910 --> 09:52.209
I've seen a wheel-barrow turn sharper!

09:52.244 --> 09:54.679
How are we to march upon Philadelphia

09:54.714 --> 09:56.380
if you can't make it across the street?!

09:56.415 --> 09:59.116
Fall in, men! On the double!

10:02.489 --> 10:04.021
See there?

10:04.056 --> 10:06.724
Them's the buggers who'll
be doing the real fighting.

10:16.101 --> 10:19.035
Shoulder your firelocks!

10:32.817 --> 10:34.383
Gentlemen...

10:34.743 --> 10:36.911
we're not conquerors,

10:37.421 --> 10:39.054
but rescuers,

10:39.789 --> 10:41.890
<i>chosen warriors</i>

10:41.925 --> 10:45.326
<i>who will rescue our native land
from the grasp of France</i>

10:45.361 --> 10:48.339
<i>and a desperate party of petty tyrants.</i>

10:49.174 --> 10:52.366
<i>Each day our numbers swell.</i>

10:52.402 --> 10:54.736
<i>And each day their spirits plummet.</i>

10:54.771 --> 10:58.639
<i>Our boots shall quake
the field of battle</i>

10:58.674 --> 11:00.662
<i>along with our enemies' hearts.</i>

11:01.276 --> 11:04.945
I'm pleased to inform you
that the Queen's Rangers

11:04.980 --> 11:07.480
have been seconded to this regiment.

11:08.717 --> 11:10.183
They were singled out for valor

11:10.218 --> 11:11.946
at the Battle of Monmouth

11:12.187 --> 11:16.422
<i>under their commander,
Lieutenant Colonel Simcoe.</i>

11:18.259 --> 11:19.692
Thank you, General.

11:19.727 --> 11:22.916
There's no higher honor
than serving under you.

11:23.917 --> 11:27.253
We shall bring the colonies
to the brink of destruction

11:28.235 --> 11:31.257
<i>to repel the ruin that threatens them.</i>

11:32.339 --> 11:36.507
And come fighting season,
the Rangers and the Legion

11:36.543 --> 11:39.778
- <i>shall unleash their combined fury...</i>
- Now.

11:39.813 --> 11:41.646
<i>...on the rebels...</i>

11:42.716 --> 11:44.649
<i>the likes of which</i>

11:45.077 --> 11:46.742
<i>they've never seen.</i>

11:48.589 --> 11:51.956
Gentlemen, till we meet again.

11:54.259 --> 11:56.493
Shoulder your firelocks!

12:00.700 --> 12:03.248
To the right, face!

12:05.805 --> 12:08.504
<i>To the front, march!</i>

12:10.408 --> 12:12.675
<i>Wheel, march!</i>

12:12.711 --> 12:13.843
<i>Step!</i>

12:15.580 --> 12:17.847
<i>Step! Step!</i>

12:38.789 --> 12:41.924
<i> Whoa.</i>

12:51.100 --> 12:53.434
Selah.

12:53.469 --> 12:56.370
Well, that's quite a firm
handshake you've got there.

12:57.175 --> 12:59.414
Well, I get a lot of practice.

13:00.228 --> 13:02.175
You greet every old ensign this way?

13:02.248 --> 13:03.914
Well, in truth, Mr. Strong,

13:03.949 --> 13:06.884
we don't get many members
of Congress here in our camp.

13:06.919 --> 13:09.719
The delegates all seem to
regard the Army as if a child

13:09.755 --> 13:12.121
and one that should neither
be seen nor heard.

13:12.156 --> 13:14.824
Yet come quickly when called.

13:14.860 --> 13:17.527
I'll be able to show you around,
let you make a full assessment

13:17.562 --> 13:19.562
in light of recent events.

13:19.598 --> 13:21.765
And General Washington?

13:21.800 --> 13:24.333
Yes, His Excellency hopes
to speak with you as well.

13:24.369 --> 13:26.435
<i>A pouch of tobacco.</i>

13:27.304 --> 13:28.771
That'll do.

13:43.486 --> 13:45.308
I'm glad to see you safe.

13:49.325 --> 13:50.647
You look well.

13:51.461 --> 13:53.900
You look well as well.

13:54.831 --> 13:56.831
Philadelphia agrees with you.

13:59.201 --> 14:01.468
If only Philadelphia
could agree with itself.

14:02.704 --> 14:04.304
But as long Congress meets there,

14:04.339 --> 14:05.872
I don't hold my breath.

14:10.278 --> 14:12.078
Thank you for coming, Selah.

14:12.543 --> 14:14.180
Thank you for writing.

14:16.047 --> 14:19.251
There is no witness
I heed more than my wife.

14:23.190 --> 14:25.348
Now, I intend to inspect the Army now,

14:26.093 --> 14:29.161
but would it be all right
if we spoke later?

14:38.972 --> 14:41.539
Those men who received you,
they joined two years ago.

14:41.575 --> 14:43.174
They've not been paid since.

14:43.209 --> 14:46.244
I can assure you their rations
are more meager than these.

14:46.813 --> 14:49.246
I'm sponsoring a bill to provide
veterans half-pay for life.

14:49.282 --> 14:52.349
Selah, the men need money now,
not promises for later.

14:52.384 --> 14:54.718
If they're not paid soon, then the
Army won't be defending Congress,

14:54.753 --> 14:57.053
we'll be defending
Congress from the Army.

15:00.359 --> 15:03.494
I'm sorry. I... I won't tell
you how to do your job.

15:03.529 --> 15:05.362
And I won't tell you how to do yours.

15:10.167 --> 15:13.354
I know you can't speak about
Benedict Arnold's intrigues,

15:13.838 --> 15:16.238
but do you still have
active intelligencers?

15:18.209 --> 15:19.902
And that includes Anna?

15:20.712 --> 15:23.112
You said that she was valuable
to you back in Setauket.

15:23.147 --> 15:24.457
Yes.

15:24.482 --> 15:26.414
Does she serve the same
purpose here in camp?

15:26.449 --> 15:28.750
Well, she wouldn't be here
if she didn't.

15:32.556 --> 15:33.666
Of course.

15:34.558 --> 15:37.091
But she is your wife, Selah.

15:37.127 --> 15:38.337
She's...

15:39.396 --> 15:41.295
If you wish to take her back
to Philadelphia with you,

15:41.331 --> 15:44.064
then, well, that is your
prerogative, of course.

15:54.276 --> 15:55.876
Oh, Mrs. Smith.

15:57.279 --> 15:58.608
Mrs. Smith.

15:59.880 --> 16:01.079
Mary.

16:03.112 --> 16:04.617
You settled in?

16:05.114 --> 16:06.819
It's beginning to feel like home.

16:07.116 --> 16:09.327
Keep telling yourself that, sweetheart.

16:10.025 --> 16:11.691
Time we put you to work.

16:16.876 --> 16:19.264
I could tell you your fingers
will get used to it.

16:19.299 --> 16:20.799
If only that were so.

16:20.834 --> 16:23.435
The truth is, you get
used to sore fingers.

16:26.106 --> 16:27.773
Oh.

16:29.944 --> 16:31.543
There you are.

16:33.613 --> 16:36.729
Gonna grow up to be a
soldier like his father.

16:37.617 --> 16:39.116
I'm sorry.

16:39.151 --> 16:40.483
You're a widow.

16:41.087 --> 16:42.887
No. No.

16:42.922 --> 16:45.222
I hadn't seen a man about.

16:47.293 --> 16:49.493
My husband, he's with the militia.

16:49.909 --> 16:51.094
Of Connecticut.

16:51.129 --> 16:53.863
The two of you ever need me
to mind Thomas overnight...

16:53.899 --> 16:55.331
He's far.

16:55.366 --> 16:57.033
Down south.

16:57.291 --> 16:58.802
I don't get word much.

17:00.472 --> 17:04.089
Well, I hear Greene has Cornwallis
chasing his tail these days.

17:05.090 --> 17:07.742
So, he's in the Carolinas?

17:08.813 --> 17:09.778
My husband?

17:09.814 --> 17:11.472
He got a name?

17:12.140 --> 17:13.682
Abraham.

17:14.685 --> 17:16.819
- Abraham Smith.
- Hmm.

17:18.489 --> 17:20.623
I can't wait for Abe to come
back from the Carolinas.

17:21.992 --> 17:24.125
So far from home.

17:24.160 --> 17:27.662
Who knew we had northern
regiments that far south.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.784
Then again, what do I know?

17:32.268 --> 17:35.503
I'm mending uniforms, not wearing one.

17:40.809 --> 17:44.377
The "privy-leges" of rank.

17:44.412 --> 17:46.113
The officers have the privy-lege...

17:46.148 --> 17:47.881
...of doing their business indoors

17:47.916 --> 17:52.653
and we have the privy-lege
of carrying it out.

17:52.688 --> 17:56.023
We're in shite while the Rangers fight.

17:58.359 --> 18:01.426
They probably have better
barracks than us, too.

18:01.462 --> 18:03.262
Along Broadway, I'm guessing.

18:03.297 --> 18:05.464
No, they're stationed up north.

18:05.499 --> 18:07.499
The farmlands around Harlem.

18:08.435 --> 18:09.864
A ways away.

18:10.604 --> 18:14.040
They make it down here quite a bit,

18:14.075 --> 18:16.162
at least to Holy Ground.

18:17.310 --> 18:19.110
Holy Ground?

18:19.146 --> 18:22.180
Called so on account of it's
across from Trinity Church.

18:22.215 --> 18:26.076
But Holy Ground is home
to all that's unholy.

18:26.111 --> 18:29.020
Heaven, hell, the immortal soul...

18:29.056 --> 18:31.422
these are but the politick
inventions of priests...

18:31.457 --> 18:33.456
<i>It's a nest of tippling shops,</i>

18:33.492 --> 18:35.592
<i>gambling dens, and brothels,</i>

18:35.627 --> 18:39.196
<i>and</i> the <i> place to go if you
want a bit of slap and tickle.</i>

18:39.231 --> 18:41.531
<i> But isn't Colonel Simcoe
aware of what his men get up to?</i>

18:41.567 --> 18:44.101
<i>Well, I suppose so. He lives among them.</i>

18:44.136 --> 18:47.171
Find the lady, find the dame,
turn the queen and win the game.

18:56.081 --> 18:58.047
I win.

19:00.651 --> 19:02.418
Seems the rebels weren't the only one

19:02.453 --> 19:04.253
to play you for a fool, Falkoff.

19:07.124 --> 19:09.224
Be that as it may, we've a new target,

19:09.259 --> 19:12.627
a man right here in the city
only recently arrived,

19:12.662 --> 19:17.565
<i>an old friend from Setauket
not fit to wear the uniform.</i>

19:17.601 --> 19:20.068
Surely Simcoe doesn't frequent
Holy Ground himself.

19:20.104 --> 19:21.936
All the officers do.

19:22.639 --> 19:24.538
I know what you're after.

19:24.573 --> 19:27.074
Been some time since
your last squeeze, eh?

19:27.110 --> 19:28.843
There's no gulling you, is there?

19:28.878 --> 19:30.477
Woodhull, wash up.

19:30.512 --> 19:31.812
You can't stink like a piss pot

19:31.848 --> 19:33.280
in front of Colonel Cooke.

19:33.698 --> 19:36.150
- Sergeant?
-<i> He wants you to join him</i>

19:36.185 --> 19:38.619
at Rivington's Coffeehouse, posthaste.

19:39.788 --> 19:41.454
Colonel Cooke knows I'm here?

19:41.489 --> 19:43.708
New York's a small town.

19:46.261 --> 19:48.294
Coffee with the quartermaster.

19:48.329 --> 19:50.897
It seems I can be gulled.

19:50.932 --> 19:52.665
What sort of farmer are you?

19:53.290 --> 19:55.334
The colonel did business with my father.

19:55.370 --> 19:57.169
What kind of business?

19:57.204 --> 19:58.937
Just pick up your shit bucket.

19:58.973 --> 20:01.273
Can you find out if he's
coming to the party or not?

20:01.308 --> 20:03.375
There's a certain lady
who's been inquiring.

20:03.410 --> 20:05.210
I will convey that to Mr. Rivington,

20:05.246 --> 20:08.914
though he is likely to
inquire as to <i> which</i> lady.

20:13.446 --> 20:15.586
Mr. Woodhull to see you, sir.

20:25.932 --> 20:27.460
What have you done?

20:28.794 --> 20:30.834
Is this what your father
would have wanted?

20:30.869 --> 20:32.169
Oh, yes, sir.

20:32.204 --> 20:33.837
In fact, it was his wish
since I was a boy

20:33.872 --> 20:35.176
that I'd be a soldier.

20:35.908 --> 20:37.774
You're a young man, Abraham,
full of passions,

20:37.810 --> 20:39.475
and this has been a trying time,

20:39.511 --> 20:41.111
but I don't want you to do
something you're going to regret.

20:41.146 --> 20:43.446
I'd regret <i> not</i> doing something, sir.

20:43.481 --> 20:45.916
General Arnold has
promised me satisfaction.

20:45.951 --> 20:49.051
Well, he's one to keep his word.

20:54.425 --> 20:57.693
It's not too late.
We'll see what we can do.

20:57.728 --> 20:59.761
If you must serve, I'm certain
I can find you a post

20:59.797 --> 21:02.231
under the new head of intelligence
right here in the battery.

21:02.266 --> 21:04.205
Oh, thank you, Colonel, but...

21:05.168 --> 21:07.235
I have no interest in that sort of work.

21:09.873 --> 21:12.240
Well, this isn't the place
to be having this discussion.

21:13.944 --> 21:16.377
General Clinton was saddened
by your father's passing

21:16.412 --> 21:18.179
and would like to meet you.

21:18.215 --> 21:21.549
He's hosting a gathering
at Kennedy House tonight.

21:21.584 --> 21:26.220
Tonight? I'm sorry, sir, I...

21:26.255 --> 21:27.420
I have to stand post.

21:27.456 --> 21:30.757
Hogwash. Consider it an order.

21:30.792 --> 21:33.593
Tell Arnold that Clinton outranks him.

21:37.199 --> 21:39.165
May I offer you anything, Mr. Woodhull?

21:39.200 --> 21:41.100
No, I'm fine.

21:41.135 --> 21:44.403
Then may I offer my condolences
on your father's death?

21:44.787 --> 21:46.572
You know each other?

21:48.376 --> 21:50.042
He used to stay at my boarding house

21:50.078 --> 21:51.944
when he ran hogs for his father.

21:51.980 --> 21:54.881
Well, he'll be running hogs again soon.

21:55.281 --> 21:57.883
Last I recall,
you were studying the law.

22:00.854 --> 22:02.221
Well, plans change.

22:02.956 --> 22:04.555
My father is dead,

22:04.591 --> 22:06.934
and I have come here
to see Benedict Arnold...

22:07.761 --> 22:09.394
and get justice.

22:20.210 --> 22:21.709
What's this?

22:21.745 --> 22:23.745
General Arnold put me into service.

22:23.780 --> 22:25.547
I'm his body man.

22:25.582 --> 22:28.115
Wherever he goes, I go.

22:30.386 --> 22:32.710
I don't want you working
for him, you hear me?

22:33.189 --> 22:34.755
I won't do anything foolish.

22:34.790 --> 22:37.324
- Do you hear me?
- Yes.

22:37.360 --> 22:38.925
Do you hear <i> me?</i>

22:40.363 --> 22:42.136
Just put them over there.

22:42.465 --> 22:43.730
What did you say?

22:43.766 --> 22:46.166
I said I'm a man now!

23:01.015 --> 23:03.449
I don't have any whiskey, gentlemen.

23:04.185 --> 23:05.517
But if you turn up next morning,

23:05.553 --> 23:07.352
I'll scrounge up an antifogmatic.

23:20.266 --> 23:22.066
Reminds me of the tavern.

23:22.101 --> 23:24.702
Oh, thank goodness, no.

23:29.509 --> 23:32.042
I heard you met General Washington.

23:32.078 --> 23:34.679
I urged him to come to Philadelphia

23:34.714 --> 23:36.190
to speak to Congress.

23:36.815 --> 23:39.316
He told me that would be
overstepping his bounds.

23:40.519 --> 23:42.051
What about the mutiny

23:42.087 --> 23:44.865
of both the Pennsylvania
and New Jersey lines?

23:45.616 --> 23:48.692
His Excellency assured me that
discipline had been restored.

23:51.038 --> 23:53.128
There's something you need to see.

23:55.766 --> 23:57.666
Fire!

24:01.457 --> 24:03.071
Do you know how it began?

24:05.340 --> 24:07.343
I heard they raided the armory,

24:07.378 --> 24:08.644
murdered their officers...

24:08.679 --> 24:10.545
I mean what set them off.

24:14.251 --> 24:16.021
Lieutenant Randall...

24:16.553 --> 24:17.918
begged me to warn Washington

24:17.954 --> 24:19.858
of what was brewing in the ranks.

24:20.690 --> 24:22.156
Feared there'd be bloodshed

24:22.191 --> 24:24.359
if their grievances weren't addressed.

24:26.865 --> 24:29.095
He's buried beneath
one of these crosses.

24:31.367 --> 24:34.934
The mutineers weren't marching
on Philadelphia to sack the city

24:34.970 --> 24:36.959
but to demand what was owed them.

24:37.473 --> 24:39.640
Yet no one from the capital
has come here since,

24:39.675 --> 24:41.275
and now they're dead.

24:43.215 --> 24:47.846
I pray their graves will speak
to Congress through you.

24:56.658 --> 24:59.725
Beaver hats, walking canes,

24:59.761 --> 25:01.626
peacock plumes.

25:01.662 --> 25:04.262
No French raspberry brandy.

25:04.653 --> 25:05.930
Just doesn't make sense.

25:05.965 --> 25:07.766
Abe should have made contact
with Townsend by now

25:07.801 --> 25:09.901
who in turn should make contact
with Hercules Mulligan.

25:10.409 --> 25:13.271
Unless Townsend's now quit
the game altogether.

25:17.310 --> 25:18.909
Am I talking to myself?

25:23.616 --> 25:24.948
Sorry.

25:26.084 --> 25:28.151
Um...

25:28.187 --> 25:29.586
ain't Mulligan in jail?

25:29.622 --> 25:31.254
No, Caleb, we've been through this.

25:31.290 --> 25:32.656
He was released weeks ago.

25:32.692 --> 25:34.424
We learned that through his slave, Cato,

25:34.459 --> 25:36.992
who was able to cross the
Hudson unmolested, remember?

25:37.028 --> 25:38.528
Yeah, Cato, right.

25:38.563 --> 25:41.297
- Major Tallmadge?
- What are you...

25:41.333 --> 25:42.816
Am I intruding?

25:43.702 --> 25:45.768
Mary, camp followers are not allowed

25:45.804 --> 25:47.102
to enter this section of the camp,

25:47.138 --> 25:48.871
let alone to walk directly into my tent.

25:48.906 --> 25:50.616
Doesn't Anna Strong?

25:51.367 --> 25:52.607
Well, she... she's...

25:52.643 --> 25:54.876
You said if I needed anything,
I should come to you,

25:54.911 --> 25:57.546
and what I need is
information on my husband.

25:57.581 --> 25:59.481
- Information?
- What he's doing.

25:59.516 --> 26:01.750
- <i>How he's doing.</i>
- It's early, Mary.

26:01.785 --> 26:04.118
I'm afraid I simply cannot
do that, Mrs. Woodhull.

26:04.154 --> 26:06.254
Your husband's mission
is highly confidential.

26:06.289 --> 26:09.218
I have a right to be kept informed.

26:09.726 --> 26:11.592
Has he joined Arnold yet?
Found a way to kill Simcoe?

26:11.627 --> 26:13.427
Shh! How did you know?

26:13.463 --> 26:15.095
I'm his wife.

26:15.130 --> 26:16.630
Who do you think delayed the soldiers

26:16.666 --> 26:18.131
while you were burning the hay?

26:18.167 --> 26:20.634
I have been helping my
husband and thus your cause

26:20.670 --> 26:23.637
for some time now, and I
deserve to know the truth.

26:25.874 --> 26:27.106
- Ben...
- No.

26:27.141 --> 26:29.141
Madam, while you are amongst this army,

26:29.177 --> 26:31.378
you will follow this army's rules.

26:31.413 --> 26:32.645
So long as you wish to remain here,

26:32.681 --> 26:34.280
you will obey the chain of command.

26:34.315 --> 26:37.484
Is that understand?
Now you will be excused.

26:43.156 --> 26:44.586
Mary.

26:45.993 --> 26:49.895
Look, it is my intention
to protect your husband.

26:50.300 --> 26:52.297
You have no more <i> right</i>
to know of his movements

26:52.332 --> 26:53.899
than does the enemy.

27:04.444 --> 27:06.844
Mary. Mary.

27:06.880 --> 27:09.246
Look, it can't be easy
worrying about him

27:09.282 --> 27:12.016
on top of moving to this
shithole, but look,

27:12.051 --> 27:14.819
Woody can take care
of himself, always has.

27:14.854 --> 27:16.287
Mary, w...

27:16.322 --> 27:17.888
Listen, please? Just listen.

27:17.923 --> 27:19.556
Oh, listen to what?

27:23.695 --> 27:26.963
There was one summer
when we were about 12,

27:27.337 --> 27:29.499
we used to sneak out
down to Crane Neck Point,

27:29.535 --> 27:31.535
right, to jump off the rocks

27:31.570 --> 27:33.844
wearing nothing but our
birthday suits, of course.

27:34.439 --> 27:37.973
This one particular day,
a squall come up.

27:38.008 --> 27:39.909
And it caught us at high tide.

27:39.944 --> 27:42.812
Now, the undertow was strong
as a team of stallions.

27:42.847 --> 27:44.447
Ben and I managed to swim ashore,

27:44.482 --> 27:47.416
but Woody, he got pulled out to sea.

27:47.452 --> 27:50.277
Now, we could only watch on,
fearing that he'd given up.

27:50.687 --> 27:52.787
But he hadn't, you see?

27:52.823 --> 27:54.656
He was saving his strength.

27:54.691 --> 27:56.724
'Cause when the current got weaker,

27:57.159 --> 27:59.226
he swam his way out and came ashore

27:59.262 --> 28:00.662
on the other side of the cove.

28:00.697 --> 28:02.581
And you know what he said?

28:03.457 --> 28:05.399
He said the only thing he feared

28:05.435 --> 28:08.869
was that we would be foolish
enough to try and rescue him.

28:11.406 --> 28:13.073
Abe's in danger.

28:13.108 --> 28:16.242
And it's not from some act
of God or force of nature.

28:16.278 --> 28:17.811
If I'm looking for a reason,

28:17.847 --> 28:20.265
I don't have to look
any further than you.

28:20.583 --> 28:22.850
You were the one who got
grabbed in the first place.

28:22.885 --> 28:26.146
Only you would be foolish enough
to smuggle alongside Tories.

28:26.888 --> 28:30.155
Oh, and unlike that fish
story that you just told me,

28:30.191 --> 28:32.592
Abe was courageous enough
to try and rescue you.

29:28.026 --> 29:29.291
I'm feeling flushed.

29:29.326 --> 29:31.526
- From the baby?
- From this corset.

29:32.104 --> 29:33.361
Egg rum for Mrs. Arnold.

29:33.396 --> 29:35.196
Are you trying to put me in labor?

29:35.231 --> 29:37.884
A Madeira, then. Make it two.

29:39.011 --> 29:40.168
He's well turned-out.

29:40.203 --> 29:42.470
Did Mr. Mulligan stitch that jacket?

29:42.505 --> 29:44.405
Reminds me of one I saw in Philadelphia

29:44.441 --> 29:46.541
on General Washington's valet.

29:47.977 --> 29:49.677
You would prefer to be back there?

29:49.712 --> 29:51.912
You would prefer me to answer that?

29:53.448 --> 29:54.915
I'll get my own drink.

30:04.960 --> 30:07.794
Woodhull... why aren't you at your post?

30:07.829 --> 30:10.029
Forgive me, General. I was invited.

30:10.065 --> 30:11.831
I had no choice. I was
invited by Colonel Cooke.

30:11.866 --> 30:14.838
Actually by General Clinton.

30:15.336 --> 30:17.436
I brought this young man here
to talk some sense into him.

30:17.472 --> 30:18.805
Maybe talk some into you as well.

30:18.840 --> 30:20.339
Two birds and all that.

30:20.374 --> 30:23.575
I suppose Abraham
would make a fine soldier,

30:23.611 --> 30:26.912
but he's more valuable to the
Army back where he belongs.

30:26.947 --> 30:30.782
His late father was a prized partner,

30:30.818 --> 30:32.651
and we need this boy to take
his place on Long Island.

30:32.686 --> 30:35.942
Sir, if I may, I'm serving
my king and country.

30:36.490 --> 30:38.656
I should be able to do it in
the manner of my own choosing.

30:38.691 --> 30:40.691
Hmm, that's where you're mistaken.

30:40.727 --> 30:42.793
The empire is bigger than any one man.

30:42.829 --> 30:45.295
Each of us must serve it
according to his talents.

30:45.331 --> 30:49.121
Should you wish to succeed your
father as magistrate, Abraham,

30:49.146 --> 30:50.700
you would have my support.

30:50.735 --> 30:52.802
I've already joined the Legion.
I won't desert them.

30:53.260 --> 30:54.336
Or the general.

30:54.371 --> 30:57.038
They'll manage, as will I.

30:57.923 --> 31:00.608
Look, I hate to lose you,
Woodhull, but this needn't be

31:00.643 --> 31:02.677
the end of our partnership,
merely the beginning.

31:02.713 --> 31:04.412
<i>If you're as valuable
as the colonel says...</i>

31:04.447 --> 31:05.680
I'm sure something could be arranged.

31:05.716 --> 31:07.415
Splendid. It just so happens...

31:07.450 --> 31:09.517
Now where's that wife of yours?

31:09.552 --> 31:12.720
- Colonel, please...
- Enjoy the party.

31:31.740 --> 31:33.439
Sir, may I take your cloak?

31:39.480 --> 31:41.007
Townsend!

31:42.283 --> 31:44.951
I'm not used to seeing
the monk outside his friary.

31:45.262 --> 31:47.652
I have come to convey
my partner's regrets

31:47.687 --> 31:51.522
<i>to you and to the young lady
who is asking after him.</i>

31:51.558 --> 31:54.604
Rivington's wife has just
returned from the country.

31:55.564 --> 31:57.796
Well, as the good book says,
"Eat, drink, be merry."

31:58.966 --> 32:01.166
"For tomorrow we die."

32:09.942 --> 32:12.609
General, if I could have a word, I...

32:12.645 --> 32:14.578
oh, excuse me.

32:14.613 --> 32:17.481
Woodhull, allow me
to introduce Mrs. Arnold.

32:17.516 --> 32:19.016
<i>This is Abraham Woodhull,</i>

32:19.051 --> 32:20.984
a gentleman farmer from Long Island.

32:21.019 --> 32:24.187
- Farmer?
- A soldier in your husband's service.

32:24.593 --> 32:27.123
I pray the general
is treating you kindly.

32:27.721 --> 32:29.092
I haven't known him long, ma'am,

32:29.127 --> 32:31.725
but I would say his
reputation is well-deserved.

32:32.430 --> 32:35.031
Sir, if you could please speak
with Colonel Cooke, I would...

32:35.066 --> 32:36.666
I've made my decision, Woodhull.

32:41.305 --> 32:43.505
What was that about? The Legion?

32:46.076 --> 32:47.409
Mr. Woodhull.

32:50.857 --> 32:52.857
_

33:03.526 --> 33:05.193
Do you really think this is the pl...

33:05.509 --> 33:06.894
<i>Cicero?</i>

33:08.564 --> 33:09.864
What are you doing?

33:09.899 --> 33:11.664
I'm here with General Arnold.

33:11.700 --> 33:13.391
That's who you're here for, too, right?

33:13.936 --> 33:15.735
You've come to spy on him. I can help.

33:15.770 --> 33:17.770
I'm his body servant.
Attend him day and night.

33:17.806 --> 33:21.241
- No.
- Where he goes, I go.

33:24.110 --> 33:25.245
Quickly.

33:25.280 --> 33:27.613
- Where did Cicero get to?
- Shouldn't you have

33:27.649 --> 33:29.514
consulted his mother
before putting him to work?

33:29.550 --> 33:31.650
The boy is old enough
to make his own decisions.

33:31.685 --> 33:33.719
And how much of a choice
did you leave him?

33:35.189 --> 33:36.322
May I remind you,

33:36.357 --> 33:37.823
I'm the one that brought Cicero

33:37.859 --> 33:39.725
and his mother back into the household.

33:39.760 --> 33:42.061
Yes, as a reminder
of your beloved André.

33:42.096 --> 33:45.230
Tell me, my dear, how much of
a choice did that leave me?

33:47.200 --> 33:48.299
Wait.

33:48.335 --> 33:49.834
In addition to your child,

33:49.870 --> 33:51.602
I'm holding a large amount of water.

33:51.637 --> 33:53.004
Please excuse me.

34:14.860 --> 34:17.060
<i>His leg ain't healed yet all the way.</i>

34:17.096 --> 34:19.916
<i>If he's on his feet for too long,
he has to walk with a cane.</i>

34:20.331 --> 34:22.197
He has this thing called a gorget.

34:22.690 --> 34:24.100
He only wears it
in front of the generals,

34:24.135 --> 34:26.902
<i>but he wants it waxed
and buffed all the time.</i>

34:28.606 --> 34:31.639
<i>He makes me polish it
till the polish shines.</i>

34:31.675 --> 34:33.574
<i>What's the use? I asked.</i>

34:33.610 --> 34:35.511
<i>"It'll make a soldier
out of you," he says.</i>

34:35.545 --> 34:37.112
<i>"So will getting up at the crack of dawn</i>

34:37.147 --> 34:39.147
<i>to pour my bath," he says.</i>

34:39.181 --> 34:41.649
<i>Oh, what else? Uh... uh...</i>

34:41.684 --> 34:43.618
<i>And his leg hurts the
most in the morning</i>

34:43.652 --> 34:45.987
<i>- and when it's cold out.
- All right, just quiet down.</i>

34:46.023 --> 34:48.822
<i>Every night, at midnight,
he takes a walk in the garden</i>

34:48.858 --> 34:50.658
<i>and does his business in the outhouse.</i>

34:50.693 --> 34:53.293
Every night, same time.

34:55.264 --> 34:58.165
<i>All right, settle down, settle down.</i>

35:22.354 --> 35:24.190
I'm feeling unwell.

35:24.225 --> 35:26.525
I'll take the carriage and return home.

35:26.561 --> 35:28.160
I hope this passes.

35:32.166 --> 35:33.932
<i>Colonel!</i>

35:36.403 --> 35:38.536
"Of course I can be Mary," she said.

35:38.572 --> 35:40.505
"That's my name."

35:40.540 --> 35:44.342
Colonel, if you may?

35:44.377 --> 35:47.445
Now that we are entering into
closer enterprise with one another,

35:47.480 --> 35:49.246
I was hoping there was
a favor I might ask of you.

35:49.282 --> 35:51.115
Oh, already?

35:51.150 --> 35:52.916
As you know, the American Legion

35:52.952 --> 35:54.385
includes a troop of cavalry.

35:54.420 --> 35:56.320
Yes, for which I provided the horse.

35:56.356 --> 35:58.055
The horse, yes, but not the hay.

35:58.091 --> 35:59.923
One's not much good without the other.

35:59.959 --> 36:01.324
Am I missing something?

36:01.360 --> 36:03.360
Are you marching to battle anytime soon?

36:03.395 --> 36:05.397
Well, orders may come at any day.

36:06.264 --> 36:08.264
Hay has become dear.

36:08.300 --> 36:10.166
It is as scarce for me as it is for you.

36:10.202 --> 36:13.436
What little I could scrounge
up, eh, goes to the Regulars.

36:13.472 --> 36:16.739
Yes, but owing to our Long Island
connection, I thought perhaps...

36:16.774 --> 36:19.494
You mean <i> my</i> Long Island connection.

36:20.111 --> 36:21.943
Pray, General, what exactly
are you bringing to the table

36:21.979 --> 36:24.079
on this enterprise of ours?

36:26.001 --> 36:27.716
Don't speak to me of this again.

36:41.664 --> 36:43.398
- Not now.
- Yes, now.

36:43.433 --> 36:45.599
I didn't stay in New York to sit still.

36:51.974 --> 36:53.573
You're after him and you need my help.

36:53.608 --> 36:54.707
We'll talk about this later.

36:54.743 --> 36:56.410
Tonight, outside the coffeehouse.

36:56.445 --> 36:58.045
Curfew. I can't get away from barracks.

36:58.080 --> 36:59.712
- Then when?
- I don't know.

36:59.748 --> 37:01.881
How are we supposed to gather
intelligence if you can't...

37:01.917 --> 37:03.350
Will you just...

37:05.154 --> 37:06.786
All right, listen,

37:06.821 --> 37:08.588
tell Tallmadge
that Arnold's leg is better

37:08.623 --> 37:10.423
but he sometimes needs a cane.

37:10.458 --> 37:13.125
He takes a midnight stroll to his
outhouse every night on the dot.

37:13.161 --> 37:14.460
It's when he's most vulnerable.

37:14.674 --> 37:16.095
Satisfied?

37:24.672 --> 37:27.272
<i>Ah, here he is. Abraham.</i>

37:27.307 --> 37:29.941
May I present General Sir Henry Clinton,

37:29.976 --> 37:32.310
our generous host tonight?

37:32.345 --> 37:34.712
- This is Woodhull?
- General, an honor.

37:34.747 --> 37:36.481
Thank you for inviting me
to your home tonight.

37:36.516 --> 37:38.416
Terrible what happened to your father.

37:38.452 --> 37:39.517
<i>My sympathies.</i>

37:39.553 --> 37:40.985
<i>Jonathan, you didn't tell me</i>

37:41.020 --> 37:42.787
this young man had joined
our provincial forces.

37:42.822 --> 37:43.733
No, no, he...

37:43.758 --> 37:45.989
Indeed he has. And we're
the luckier for it.

37:46.024 --> 37:49.460
Brave young men like Woodhull
are in very short supply.

37:49.495 --> 37:51.161
The best of America.

37:51.197 --> 37:52.462
Jolly good.

37:52.998 --> 37:55.632
Welcome to His Majesty's
Army, Private Woodhull.

37:57.536 --> 38:00.003
He gets himself killed, you're at fault.

38:00.038 --> 38:02.671
I'll be personally responsible
for Woodhull's safety.

38:12.673 --> 38:15.674
Congress shouldn't have to go
cap in hand to the states.

38:15.710 --> 38:17.910
We should be collecting customs duties.

38:17.945 --> 38:20.746
Some might wonder isn't that
what we went to war to prevent?

38:20.781 --> 38:23.916
We went to war
to make our own decisions.

38:23.951 --> 38:28.453
But there will be no
representation without taxation.

38:29.323 --> 38:31.956
Well... Godspeed, Selah.

38:31.991 --> 38:33.324
If there's anything else
that you require,

38:33.359 --> 38:35.259
don't hesitate to ask.

38:49.775 --> 38:52.021
Your letter opened my eyes, Anna.

38:52.711 --> 38:54.566
In more ways than one.

38:55.567 --> 38:57.527
It reminded me of your courage,

38:58.570 --> 39:00.050
of your compassion.

39:00.446 --> 39:02.085
I cannot return to Philadelphia

39:02.121 --> 39:04.354
without asking you to come with me.

39:06.523 --> 39:07.954
I talked to Ben.

39:08.913 --> 39:11.193
He said you are important here.

39:13.564 --> 39:15.898
But you are important to me as well.

39:18.836 --> 39:22.704
Though I confess
that doesn't interest me

39:22.740 --> 39:24.538
as much as it used to.

39:26.748 --> 39:28.348
What does interest me...

39:31.258 --> 39:33.614
is what is important to you?

39:38.316 --> 39:39.853
You don't have to answer now.

39:41.933 --> 39:44.157
But I do wish an answer

39:44.894 --> 39:46.226
when you're ready.

39:49.098 --> 39:52.232
In the meantime... may I write you?

39:56.143 --> 39:57.608
Of course.

39:59.107 --> 40:00.806
You're my husband.

40:25.281 --> 40:28.576
Do you know why I favor
a serrated blade?

40:29.452 --> 40:31.735
There's a trick I learned
from the Abyssinians

40:31.770 --> 40:34.839
on James Bruce's expedition to Gondar.

40:35.166 --> 40:38.086
Stab the bayonet, twist the blade,

40:38.677 --> 40:42.112
and the notches will pull
the intestines right out.

40:46.352 --> 40:48.318
So, how is my old friend?

40:50.355 --> 40:52.021
He's well-protected, sir.

40:52.350 --> 40:53.789
We kept watch outside his post,

40:53.825 --> 40:55.725
but it's under guard day and night.

40:55.760 --> 40:57.227
And even if we could sneak past them,

40:57.262 --> 40:59.628
soldiers are always going in and out.

41:00.358 --> 41:01.664
Certain you wish to proceed?

41:01.699 --> 41:03.632
I made a promise I would deal with him.

41:05.936 --> 41:08.937
He had the chance to stay out
of my way, and he chose not to.

41:09.617 --> 41:11.206
<i>There was an ocean between us,</i>

41:11.242 --> 41:14.109
<i>and yet he was foolhardy
enough to return.</i>

41:14.144 --> 41:17.079
Finally have the new man in
place as head of intelligence.

41:19.516 --> 41:21.549
Maybe he has some idea
of who's responsible

41:21.585 --> 41:23.673
for your father's death

41:24.320 --> 41:26.287
or what happened to that ransom money.

41:27.176 --> 41:29.690
His letter mentioned that the
two of you were familiar.

41:33.363 --> 41:34.695
General.

41:37.100 --> 41:40.133
Pleasure to meet you.
We have much to discuss.

41:43.364 --> 41:44.530
Major.

41:44.974 --> 41:46.606
Thank you for coming, Abraham.

41:48.243 --> 41:50.443
Why don't you take a seat?
