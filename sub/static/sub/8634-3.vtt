01:48.088 --> 01:54.186
The eyes Of Thundera are
finally within reach!

01:54.361 --> 01:59.958
But Thundercats are resourceful.
It Could  be bothersome

02:01.201 --> 02:03.635
they are All present at their camp ...

02:03.804 --> 02:07.205
... except Lion-O, their young leader.

02:08.875 --> 02:11.708
Excellent.

02:11.878 --> 02:16.781
since Lion-O always carries The eye of
Thundara  with him ...

02:16.950 --> 02:19.612
... embedded in the sword of Omens.

02:19.786 --> 02:25.281
It can be destroyed ...

02:26.827 --> 02:31.958
... when I destroy the Thundercats.

02:40.907 --> 02:43.137
wow You did it, A Thunder Tank.

02:43.310 --> 02:46.609
And you built it from the
junk of the spaceship?

02:46.780 --> 02:52.150
Salvaged. From equipment
I salvaged from the ship.

02:52.319 --> 02:56.483
I must admit, Panthro, I didn't
think you could do it.

02:56.656 --> 03:01.992
Are you kidding? You are looking at
the world's best builders.

03:02.696 --> 03:06.666
There seems to be a storm approaching.
 Is that thing rust proof?

03:11.104 --> 03:15.234
Wilykat.It's raining stones, ow,

03:19.346 --> 03:22.747
stones My wiskers, it's boulders.

03:22.916 --> 03:25.950
- into the ship, quickly.
- Not me.

03:26.086 --> 03:28.919
Iam not leaving my baby alone.

03:53.113 --> 03:56.555
Blasted Rocks buried the spaceship, too.

04:11.064 --> 04:13.464
everyone okay in there?

04:15.101 --> 04:19.899
- Yes, luckly.
- What kind of storm was that?

04:20.173 --> 04:23.802
It wasnt natural, that certain

04:26.546 --> 04:29.879
We are gettin far from the camp, Lion-O.

04:30.050 --> 04:33.315
Go on back if you want, Snarf.
No one forced you to come along.

04:33.486 --> 04:36.148
It's kinda kreepy around here.

04:36.323 --> 04:39.200
Soon as you jumping at your own shadow.

04:39.392 --> 04:43.400
Who, me? Old Snarf
is not afraid of anything ...yow

04:43.863 --> 04:45.900
See?

04:46.066 --> 04:50.002
When you are fearce like me, you
throw a fearce shadow , that's all.

04:52.439 --> 04:55.806
okay Laugh,
but I  keep hearing things, Lion-O.

04:55.976 --> 05:01.471
Naturally. The jungle is full of life,
and all of its noisy.

05:06.620 --> 05:10.589
nice going, Snarf.
You scared them clear out of sight.

05:18.465 --> 05:20.555
Snarf.don't

05:34.547 --> 05:38.555
What ithe matter with you, Snarf?
that thing was twice as big as you are.

05:39.052 --> 05:44.900
It does not frighten me. Everything I see
is not only shadows and fancies.

05:45.058 --> 05:47.100
I have not thought either.

05:47.201 --> 05:51.444
We will return as soon as we have seen
where this track leads and ...

05:52.565 --> 05:59.100
- Lion-O.
- I do not hold. Of slipping.

06:00.674 --> 06:05.555
- I'll get you up, Lion-O.
- There is nothing I can do.

06:19.125 --> 06:21.685
Here, Lion-O. Pull yourself up.

06:22.462 --> 06:26.364
That is what I do,
but I do not seem to get anywhere.

06:27.567 --> 06:34.100
You must do something wrong.
Snarf is steady as a rock.

06:36.176 --> 06:38.222
Wha ...?

06:39.145 --> 06:41.875
You call it a joke, Snarf?

06:43.216 --> 06:45.333
What is it?

06:48.988 --> 06:51.222
What's going on, Snarf?

06:55.228 --> 06:57.719
<i> Beware, he is slipping back. </ i></i>

06:58.431 --> 07:02.555
<i> - Drag.
- We prefer. We prefer. </ I></i>

07:03.069 --> 07:07.403
<i> - Pull harder.
- Calm down, he is heavy. </ I></i>

07:07.874 --> 07:09.899
Snarf? Are you okay?

07:11.311 --> 07:15.999
- It can be said.
- Tie off us. I'm Lion-O.

07:30.730 --> 07:34.999
Dare you make fun of me,
Thundercats sir?

07:47.814 --> 07:51.900
I do not think
they have heard of us.

07:52.452 --> 07:55.999
The sky? Yes.
We came from the sky.

08:00.527 --> 08:02.888
And yes, we crashed.

08:06.499 --> 08:08.499
Each of us now?

08:08.600 --> 08:13.667
I'll have to hold back my
battle lust until we find out there.

08:19.646 --> 08:23.776
- Should not Lion-O pray to be back now?
- He 's certainly good.

08:23.950 --> 08:27.317
If he was in trouble,
Thun, their eyes would call on us.

08:27.487 --> 08:32.015
No sense to worry about.
He is a man now.

08:38.398 --> 08:42.443
It does not matter, Snarf.
I can not access it.

08:50.376 --> 08:53.607
It looks like the boss here.

08:53.780 --> 08:58.012
- Fell you in one of our traps?
- You heard him.

08:58.184 --> 09:00.276
Berbils.

09:03.590 --> 09:07.777
It's probably not a good idea to
make him angry, Lion-O.

09:11.264 --> 09:15.928
Berbils. Ro-Bear Berbils. Berbils.

09:16.102 --> 09:21.039
From the planet Ro-Bear.
Been here Berbil-year.

09:21.207 --> 09:26.440
They probably called "Berbils" Snarf.
"Ro-Bear Berbils".

09:27.280 --> 09:29.646
It is not what I have called them.

09:36.990 --> 09:38.990
They are quite happy, right?

09:39.158 --> 09:43.288
I have to admit that they seem better now.

09:43.463 --> 09:47.866
Ro-Bear-Berbil-Belle. Guests.

09:51.671 --> 09:54.834
Eat. Very good.

09:55.008 --> 09:57.977
Thank you.

09:58.912 --> 10:02.999
Wait. Not until I
know that it is safe.

10:05.451 --> 10:07.555
It is delicious.

10:08.955 --> 10:11.955
It was. As with almost anything
other than the stores ...

10:12.058 --> 10:14.083
... Thundercats have lived on.

10:14.560 --> 10:19.054
- Where do fruit picking?
- Ro-Bear-Bill.

10:19.232 --> 10:23.800
Call me: Ro Bear Bill.
Come.

10:26.606 --> 10:34.000
Berbil-fruit. Meat, fruit, bread-fruit;
vegetarian fruit of all varieties.

10:34.180 --> 10:38.100
- And the candy-fruit.
- Candy-fruit?

10:41.854 --> 10:43.999
Good.

10:44.891 --> 10:50.666
- Trollogs. Attack. Attack Ro-Bears.
- Trollogs?

10:53.900 --> 10:59.167
- What is Trollogs, Ro-Bear-Bill?
- They live in caves in the north.

10:59.339 --> 11:05.744
They are attacking our village now and then
To access the Ro-Bear Berbil-fruit.

11:05.912 --> 11:08.005
We can help you. - Come, Snarf.

11:08.181 --> 11:13.141
No. We can not mix
you into our problems.

11:13.319 --> 11:15.555
You are our guests.

11:30.103 --> 11:32.970
You need help. The arrows will not help.

11:33.139 --> 11:36.631
No, they never do.

11:36.809 --> 11:42.179
- Why do you use them?
- Because we do not want to harm anybody.

11:42.348 --> 11:47.149
Why do not you
Trollogs to the era in which fruit?

11:47.520 --> 11:51.800
- And behave like wimps?
- I do not understand.

11:52.525 --> 11:55.085
I understand exactly.

12:01.901 --> 12:07.700
- Your Berbils may strike.
- They may always.

12:07.807 --> 12:11.265
And we just stand here
while it is happening?

12:11.444 --> 12:16.999
- Not much we can do.
- I can not stand!

12:54.654 --> 12:59.353
It was really exciting, Lion-O.

12:59.525 --> 13:03.188
- Right, Ro-Bear-Belle?
- Yes.

13:03.362 --> 13:07.594
You're not angry because I loved me,
I lost control.

13:07.767 --> 13:12.534
Yes, but no one was injured after all.

13:12.705 --> 13:16.266
No, Trollogs will probably not
trouble you for some time to come.

13:16.442 --> 13:20.469
- No. Poor Trollogs.
- Do you feel sorry for them?

13:20.646 --> 13:24.047
Although they come after the fruit?

13:24.217 --> 13:30.588
They do not do it for themselves.
Trollogs do not eat the fruit.

13:30.823 --> 13:36.227
They can only eat the leaves
from Krawberrybusken.

13:37.296 --> 13:42.290
<i> peaks above their
caves are full of bushes ...</ i></i>

13:43.069 --> 13:47.631
<i> ... but Gigantors living
where, lets not pick them. </ i></i>

13:47.807 --> 13:51.709
<i> If they do not get Ro-Bear Berbil-fruit. </ i></i>

13:51.878 --> 13:57.976
<i> And now they will return empty-handed. </ i></i>

14:04.056 --> 14:09.653
<i> Gigantors will be furious. </ i></i>

14:14.100 --> 14:18.298
Do not be afraid. Not by the sword;
anyway. It is a warning.

14:18.738 --> 14:22.572
Omens sword
give me sight beyond sight.

14:27.547 --> 14:30.641
They must be Gigantors.

14:31.651 --> 14:34.999
I can take care of them myself.

14:35.221 --> 14:39.681
No, please, Lion-O.
Summoning the others from the Thundercats.

14:42.528 --> 14:47.090
Okay, Snarf.
Just to satisfy you.

14:50.570 --> 14:56.700
Thunder, thunder, thunder.
Thundercats, ho!

15:09.956 --> 15:13.824
- Look, Thundercatsignalen.
- Lion-O needs us.

15:13.993 --> 15:15.999
Come on, Thundercats.

15:21.934 --> 15:25.631
Do you think the Thundercats
did not see the signal, Lion-O?

15:25.805 --> 15:27.888
We can not worry about it now.

16:17.623 --> 16:21.999
- They were everywhere, Thundercats.
- They got her.

16:23.629 --> 16:26.629
Tygr, Cheetara, Panthro,
Wilykat and Kit ...

16:26.730 --> 16:31.700
... I have met new friends.
This is their oldest, Ro-Bear-Bill.

16:31.871 --> 16:34.738
This is my people, Thundercats.

16:42.081 --> 16:45.414
Thundercats have survived.

16:45.584 --> 16:49.281
And now they have become friends
with Ro-Bear Berbils.

16:49.455 --> 16:58.100
They have endless food.
I can not afford it.

17:18.451 --> 17:24.000
Thank you, Lion-O.
And thank your friends again.

17:24.190 --> 17:28.523
They are also your friends, Ro-Bear-Bill.
Friends help each other.

17:32.531 --> 17:35.864
Torment, torture. Locusts.

17:36.035 --> 17:39.527
My God.
They destroy our crops.

17:39.705 --> 17:44.369
Wait, Ro-Bear-Bill. I think
there is something strange with the swarm.

17:51.016 --> 17:54.008
I <i> know </ i> that there is something strange.</i>

18:01.861 --> 18:03.999
Up, insect.

18:04.263 --> 18:07.494
Take you out of here,
if you value your neck.

18:19.011 --> 18:21.111
There was improvement ...

18:28.387 --> 18:30.685
The sword, it ... it ...

18:31.190 --> 18:33.351
The sword, yes.

18:33.526 --> 18:39.362
Call it, Lion-O.
Cold, and it reads you.

18:39.532 --> 18:41.532
Hunt, yes.

18:41.633 --> 18:47.029
Omens sword, came to my hand.
I, Lion-O, commands it.

19:18.904 --> 19:25.444
You must do better against you
Thundercats next time, Mumm-Ra.

19:29.248 --> 19:37.200
And that you will make.
Time means nothing for Mumm-Ra.

19:44.330 --> 19:47.493
- Lion-O.
- Why did it take so long?

19:47.666 --> 19:50.931
It's a long story.

19:55.107 --> 19:57.268
Hello, Ro-Bear-Bill.

19:57.443 --> 20:00.810
We are here to welcome you,
Thundercats.

20:00.980 --> 20:06.400
- We are glad to have you as neighbors.
- Then it's mutual.

20:06.552 --> 20:10.784
Thanks for the welcome, friends.
You may be the course.

20:18.030 --> 20:20.362
Led home?

20:20.533 --> 20:24.765
It will make it ..
We build it up there.

20:24.937 --> 20:28.873
Build it? Just you?

20:29.041 --> 20:33.999
They will take a while,
of course, but we ...

20:37.983 --> 20:40.781
We help to build.

20:40.953 --> 20:44.946
Thanks, but we can not allow it.

20:45.124 --> 20:50.391
- It's too big ...
- You said that we were friends.

20:50.563 --> 20:52.724
Friends help each other.

20:53.032 --> 20:56.832
He has a point there, tygr.
Right?

20:57.002 --> 20:59.527
He has really, Lion-O.

20:59.705 --> 21:05.999
Thundercats accept this offer
Ro-Bear-Bill, with gratitude.

21:10.950 --> 21:15.649
A bowl for the cats new place.
