01:01.176 --> 01:03.186
Mr. McHugh, Mrs. McHugh,

01:03.345 --> 01:04.798
your support has helped us

01:04.799 --> 01:07.305
make this a world-class
institution.

01:07.796 --> 01:10.651
We have such amazing plans
for the new season.

01:10.652 --> 01:12.267
I'll have Mr. Hayes
tell you all about

01:12.268 --> 01:15.148
the exciting exhibits still
available for sponsorship.

01:16.644 --> 01:17.412
Where is he?

01:18.938 --> 01:19.978
Go get him.

01:21.373 --> 01:23.706
I'm sure Mr. Hayes
will be here any second.

01:25.154 --> 01:26.871
Myrna is freaking out, Owen.

01:26.872 --> 01:28.139
Where is Mr. Hayes?

01:28.460 --> 01:29.610
He's not in the west gallery.

01:29.611 --> 01:30.576
I'm about to look
in the men's room.

01:30.577 --> 01:31.692
Just keep looking for him.

01:32.435 --> 01:33.699
Uh, excuse me...

01:43.012 --> 01:43.754
Darling.

01:44.112 --> 01:45.192
One second.

01:45.210 --> 01:48.345
I'm just about to toss a guy
off the Brooklyn Bridge.

01:49.639 --> 01:51.644
Oh, I am sure that...

01:53.175 --> 01:56.129
"Carter Damon" would
appreciate a short reprieve.

01:56.292 --> 01:57.704
Too late. He just went kersplat.

01:57.705 --> 01:59.081
Now how can I help you?

01:59.163 --> 02:00.600
I have invited my acting class

02:00.601 --> 02:01.709
to come here Friday night

02:01.710 --> 02:04.183
to do the Nora scenes
from "A Doll's House."

02:04.184 --> 02:05.191
Thank you for the warning.

02:05.267 --> 02:06.566
I will make myself scarce.

02:06.567 --> 02:10.622
No, no, no. No, no, darling,
this class could really benefit

02:10.624 --> 02:12.657
from your perspective
as a--as a writer.

02:12.658 --> 02:14.636
No, you--you definitely
should be here.

02:14.637 --> 02:15.682
Mother, what's going on?

02:17.626 --> 02:18.964
There's a lovely
girl in the class...

02:18.965 --> 02:20.347
- Oh, mother...
- and I just thought maybe--

02:20.348 --> 02:22.158
you're not trying
to fix me up again.

02:22.159 --> 02:24.656
Haven't you learned your
lesson after the last fiasco?

02:25.505 --> 02:27.092
Fiasco? You married her.

02:27.093 --> 02:28.551
Yes, and how did
that marriage end?

02:29.237 --> 02:31.301
Honey, I am just
trying to help you.

02:31.302 --> 02:33.125
You have to admit that
your social life has been

02:33.126 --> 02:34.792
a bit anemic as of late.

02:34.798 --> 02:37.083
Now I want to throw myself
off the Brooklyn Bridge.

02:37.253 --> 02:38.162
Oh, darling.

02:38.407 --> 02:40.770
All you have been doing
for the last few months

02:40.771 --> 02:42.477
is writing and working
with Beckett.

02:42.478 --> 02:44.768
Now I think a fix up is in order.

02:45.861 --> 02:46.955
Unless...

02:47.283 --> 02:48.061
Unless?

02:49.006 --> 02:51.219
You have some reason for not
putting yourself out there.

03:12.732 --> 03:14.222
Getting ready for your
close-up, Castle?

03:14.703 --> 03:17.132
No, just trying to discern
the hidden meaning.

03:17.672 --> 03:19.499
Is it about the
rise of technology,

03:19.549 --> 03:20.703
rampant narcissism,

03:20.704 --> 03:23.268
or did someone just have
a lot of extra TVs?

03:23.269 --> 03:25.059
Well, sometimes you don't
need to know what it's about.

03:25.060 --> 03:27.260
Sometimes it's just... art.

03:28.052 --> 03:30.118
Why, detective Beckett, how
very existential of you.

03:30.119 --> 03:32.271
Let me guess.
Art theory in college.

03:32.272 --> 03:34.756
No. The closest I ever came
to taking an art class

03:34.757 --> 03:36.433
was posing for one as a model.

03:36.635 --> 03:37.328
Wait.

03:37.329 --> 03:38.086
Posing in?

03:38.438 --> 03:39.315
Not a stitch.

03:41.391 --> 03:43.288
Meet Bryan Hayes, 39.

03:43.346 --> 03:44.909
Executive director of the museum.

03:44.939 --> 03:47.033
Looks like somebody gave him
liberty and gave him death.

03:47.034 --> 03:48.403
Any idea when this happened?

03:48.578 --> 03:51.737
Hayes was last seen at
10:00 by a Myrna Ramsey,

03:51.738 --> 03:53.342
the museum's
development director.

03:53.351 --> 03:55.512
His body was discovered
around 10:21.

03:55.513 --> 03:57.852
So the killer must have struck
sometime within that window.

03:57.853 --> 03:58.894
Killing him during the gala,

03:58.895 --> 03:59.905
that's pretty ballsy.

04:00.127 --> 04:02.619
My money's on he walked
in on the other crime

04:02.620 --> 04:03.845
being committed here tonight.

04:05.348 --> 04:06.893
It's called the "Fist
Of Capitalism."

04:07.572 --> 04:10.399
A searing indictment of our
consumer-driven culture.

04:10.543 --> 04:12.568
Somebody stole the
Fist Of Capitalism?

04:12.837 --> 04:14.644
Anyone check up the
ass of socialism?

04:14.645 --> 04:16.432
How much was it worth,
Mrs. Ramsey?

04:16.625 --> 04:17.584
$50 million.

04:18.331 --> 04:19.947
The diamonds alone
were worth 30.

04:20.480 --> 04:21.856
The Fist was on loan to us.

04:22.195 --> 04:24.808
Mr. Hayes assured the
owners it would be safe.

04:25.457 --> 04:27.942
Y-you know, I notice
that you have cameras,

04:27.943 --> 04:29.580
so there's obviously
a security system.

04:29.581 --> 04:30.945
Why wasn't the alarm triggered?

04:30.946 --> 04:33.463
It should've been, the moment
anyone stepped into this room.

04:33.699 --> 04:36.351
My security team is trying
to determine why it wasn't.

04:36.352 --> 04:37.967
Okay, well, we'll need a
list of all the people

04:37.968 --> 04:38.994
who attended the gala

04:38.995 --> 04:40.628
along with the videos
from the cameras.

04:40.656 --> 04:41.362
Of course.

04:41.363 --> 04:43.457
We'll also need to talk to
whoever found the body.

04:44.844 --> 04:46.039
I can't believe this.

04:47.300 --> 04:49.009
This is the worst day of my life.

04:49.740 --> 04:51.374
Were you close to
Mr. Hayes, Alyssa?

04:51.402 --> 04:52.342
We worked together.

04:52.517 --> 04:54.425
I helped him curate this exhibit.

04:54.936 --> 04:56.744
He was a lovely man

04:56.745 --> 04:59.455
and very supportive of
young artists like me.

04:59.509 --> 05:00.816
Oh, so you're an artist?

05:01.161 --> 05:02.346
This is my day job.

05:02.493 --> 05:03.734
Art is my passion.

05:03.872 --> 05:06.363
Mr. Hayes even put one of my
sculptures in the exhibit.

05:06.537 --> 05:08.353
Did Mr. Hayes have any family?

05:08.742 --> 05:10.776
A mother in Idaho, I think.

05:10.976 --> 05:12.643
So Mr. Hayes

05:12.644 --> 05:14.537
was supposed to work the
crowd tonight, right?

05:14.538 --> 05:15.956
What do you think he
was doing over here?

05:16.616 --> 05:19.302
I know he was worried about
the "Fist Of Capitalism,"

05:20.126 --> 05:21.294
especially with the gala

05:21.295 --> 05:24.039
and the people and all
the distractions--

05:24.040 --> 05:26.321
Wait. Are you saying
that he was worried

05:26.322 --> 05:27.577
someone might steal the Fist?

05:27.809 --> 05:28.977
Ever since it got here.

05:29.536 --> 05:30.472
He even reviewed

05:30.473 --> 05:32.164
the security video of the Fist,

05:32.242 --> 05:33.128
going back two weeks,

05:33.129 --> 05:34.947
to when we first
put it on display.

05:35.980 --> 05:37.809
I thought he was being paranoid,

05:39.046 --> 05:40.792
but... I guess he knew
something I didn't.

05:41.586 --> 05:42.965
$50 million?

05:42.984 --> 05:45.716
That's why Hayes was
AWOLl from the gala.

05:45.717 --> 05:47.034
He came to check on the Fist.

05:47.035 --> 05:49.673
But the thief was already
on his way out with it...

05:49.696 --> 05:51.168
Through this gallery,

05:51.169 --> 05:52.917
which put him on a collision
course with Hayes.

05:52.918 --> 05:54.824
So Hayes confronts
him, they struggle,

05:54.825 --> 05:57.158
- and Hayes get pushed into the spikes.
- And at that moment,

05:57.159 --> 05:58.415
our thief becomes a killer.

05:58.416 --> 06:00.604
A killer who gains
access to the museum

06:00.605 --> 06:01.302
through the gala.

06:01.303 --> 06:02.135
That's not likely.

06:03.001 --> 06:03.893
All arriving guests

06:03.894 --> 06:05.393
were screened at two
security checkpoints

06:05.394 --> 06:06.607
and then greeted by board members

06:06.608 --> 06:07.620
who knew them personally.

06:08.250 --> 06:09.046
Odds are

06:09.572 --> 06:10.953
the thief came in
through the roof--

06:10.954 --> 06:13.709
an air vent probably-- and
then disabled the alarms.

06:13.756 --> 06:14.959
I'm sorry. Who are you?

06:15.568 --> 06:18.742
I'm Serena Kaye, the museum's
insurance investigator.

06:18.829 --> 06:20.561
So if the thief got
in through the vent,

06:20.562 --> 06:21.771
then how did he get out?

06:21.815 --> 06:22.658
The loading bay.

06:23.170 --> 06:24.758
The guards there checked
everyone entering,

06:24.759 --> 06:26.077
but they didn't check
people leaving.

06:26.078 --> 06:27.841
Plus, the bay was full
of catering vans.

06:27.842 --> 06:30.045
He could've had one waiting for
him and just blended right in.

06:30.346 --> 06:31.024
Oh, she's good.

06:31.105 --> 06:32.991
At theory, but what about proof?

06:34.236 --> 06:35.919
I don't need proof to
know that I'm right.

06:36.162 --> 06:37.820
It's my job, and...

06:38.142 --> 06:39.398
I can help you with yours.

06:39.399 --> 06:40.100
How so?

06:40.101 --> 06:43.279
I get a 1% finder's fee for
recovering stolen objects.

06:43.417 --> 06:44.330
I want that Fist.

06:44.875 --> 06:45.975
You want your murderer.

06:45.976 --> 06:47.036
We have common goals.

06:47.104 --> 06:49.559
I could consult on your
case and share my insight.

06:49.560 --> 06:51.115
You know, that is
an intriguing idea.

06:51.116 --> 06:52.803
No, thank you.
That won't be necessary.

06:52.804 --> 06:54.737
Well, you can't blame
a girl for trying.

06:55.056 --> 06:56.596
Mr. Castle, detective Beckett.

06:59.744 --> 07:01.285
You know, we really
could've used her.

07:01.655 --> 07:03.104
She has valuable assets.

07:03.204 --> 07:04.199
Not those kind.

07:05.359 --> 07:06.734
Castle, she'd just
get in the way.

07:07.230 --> 07:07.814
Really?

07:08.765 --> 07:10.473
And what if she's
on to something?

07:14.547 --> 07:15.988
Ryan, check and see

07:15.989 --> 07:17.887
if all of the catering
vans are accounted for

07:17.888 --> 07:19.755
and interview all
the catering staff.

07:19.756 --> 07:21.991
See if anyone saw anything
unusual in the loading bay.

07:24.170 --> 07:25.533
Now was that so hard?

07:30.983 --> 07:32.359
So for reasons unknown,

07:32.424 --> 07:36.109
Hayes thought someone might
swipe the "Fist Of Capitalism."

07:36.175 --> 07:38.238
We don't know why, but
he goes to check on it

07:38.239 --> 07:39.867
and ends up paying for
it with his life.

07:40.696 --> 07:42.252
Yeah, except as it turns out,

07:42.639 --> 07:44.485
that's not what the
security video shows.

07:44.929 --> 07:45.917
What does it show?

07:45.918 --> 07:48.602
The Fist sitting there,
undisturbed in the gallery.

07:48.660 --> 07:50.423
The thief tapped into
the camera lines

07:50.424 --> 07:52.116
and rigged a prerecorded loop.

07:52.117 --> 07:52.940
There's no prints,

07:52.941 --> 07:55.763
but CSU did find what
they think is hair gel.

07:55.934 --> 07:57.348
Hair gel?
Where would they find that?

07:57.458 --> 07:58.012
In the air duct.

07:58.013 --> 07:59.546
In the air duct?
That's just what Serena--

07:59.547 --> 08:01.016
It's a lucky guess.

08:01.121 --> 08:02.580
So was the call on
the loading bay.

08:02.834 --> 08:03.588
What do you mean?

08:04.000 --> 08:06.655
Two of the caterers recall
seeing a blue Astro van

08:06.656 --> 08:07.377
parked there.

08:07.378 --> 08:09.969
Same color as the catering vans,
but without the company logo.

08:10.219 --> 08:11.024
Imagine that.

08:11.080 --> 08:12.712
Did we get a description
on anyone in the van?

08:12.713 --> 08:14.276
No, but I put an APB
out on it.

08:14.586 --> 08:15.227
Beckett.

08:17.302 --> 08:18.529
Oh, great. What'd you do now?

08:18.612 --> 08:19.310
Shut up.

08:28.975 --> 08:29.692
Detective,

08:29.779 --> 08:31.282
I believe you've met Serena Kaye.

08:31.303 --> 08:32.240
Hello again.

08:33.832 --> 08:35.259
What are you doing here?

08:35.260 --> 08:38.058
Ms. Kaye has presented me with...

08:38.650 --> 08:40.448
a very compelling proposal.

08:40.494 --> 08:43.110
Yeah, I am familiar
with her proposal.

08:43.111 --> 08:45.129
Difference is, I
like what I heard.

08:45.130 --> 08:47.033
Uh, captain Gates--
she has expertise,

08:47.034 --> 08:49.706
which she can bring to bear
as a consultant on this case.

08:49.815 --> 08:52.721
Sir, I prefer working
with my team.

08:52.845 --> 08:55.900
Which includes a consultant
with no expertise at anything.

08:56.234 --> 08:59.050
Serena will be a value
add for a change.

09:02.362 --> 09:03.755
I look forward to
working with you.

09:08.781 --> 09:13.866
Sync by YYeTs, corrections by Alex1969
www.addic7ed.com

09:18.041 --> 09:18.993
Well, I will give you this,

09:18.994 --> 09:21.682
you've got some gigantic balls.

09:22.025 --> 09:24.201
What I said about the thief,
did I turn out to be right?

09:26.757 --> 09:28.320
I'm about results, detective.

09:29.625 --> 09:31.727
This is the best way for both
of us to get what we want.

09:31.948 --> 09:32.870
Think of it as a merger.

09:33.162 --> 09:34.662
More like a hostile takeover.

09:35.111 --> 09:37.003
I'll have detective Ryan
bring you up to speed.

09:37.263 --> 09:40.147
He bypassed security cameras
here, here, and here.

09:40.559 --> 09:41.846
Then near as we can figure,

09:41.847 --> 09:43.296
uh, he left via the loading bay

09:43.321 --> 09:44.491
in a blue van.

09:45.386 --> 09:46.552
And, uh, that's...

09:47.485 --> 09:48.728
pretty much where we are.

09:49.354 --> 09:50.723
What about the security footage

09:50.724 --> 09:52.935
that Hayes was looking
at from two weeks ago?

09:53.353 --> 09:55.837
If the killer had cased
out the exhibit,

09:55.838 --> 09:56.850
maybe he's on that video.

09:56.851 --> 09:58.835
Well--well, see, that--
that's the problem,

09:58.836 --> 10:00.128
because security downloads

10:00.129 --> 10:02.028
all the camera footage
into flash drives.

10:02.029 --> 10:03.978
Now Hayes checked out one
of the flash drives,

10:03.979 --> 10:05.204
but now it's missing.

10:05.589 --> 10:06.158
It wasn't in his office,

10:06.159 --> 10:07.503
and it wasn't on
his body, either.

10:08.012 --> 10:10.438
Maybe the killer took it
because he knew he was on it.

10:12.237 --> 10:13.363
So what's our next move?

10:13.402 --> 10:15.308
Major case squad sent in a list

10:15.309 --> 10:17.691
of all of the fences
that might be interested

10:17.692 --> 10:18.950
in a piece like the Fist,

10:18.951 --> 10:21.043
and so we are looking
into that now.

10:21.403 --> 10:23.906
The Fist is too hot to handle
now that there's a body on it.

10:23.907 --> 10:25.767
So the thief may try to
fence off the diamonds,

10:25.768 --> 10:27.784
but he won't do business
with anyone on that list.

10:27.877 --> 10:29.341
Anyone on it's yesterday's news.

10:29.535 --> 10:30.739
Well, do you have a better idea?

10:31.355 --> 10:32.162
Yo, guys.

10:32.457 --> 10:34.170
Found something.
I was going over the security s--

10:34.595 --> 10:36.279
Oh, detective esposito, this is

10:36.616 --> 10:37.571
Serena Kaye.

10:38.116 --> 10:39.012
She's with us.

10:41.476 --> 10:42.154
Okay.

10:42.977 --> 10:43.610
Anyhow...

10:43.955 --> 10:45.784
uh, we found these
clamped to the wires

10:45.785 --> 10:46.884
on the security system.

10:47.049 --> 10:48.780
It basically cancels
out the alarm signals

10:48.781 --> 10:49.880
before they reach the computer.

10:49.881 --> 10:51.209
It's called an ISI or--

10:51.210 --> 10:52.607
An inductive signal interrupter.

10:54.302 --> 10:57.005
This one's custom made.
I recognize it.

10:57.101 --> 10:57.803
From where?

10:57.804 --> 10:59.332
From a report I read

10:59.471 --> 11:01.866
on the 1992 Vermeer
theft in Brussels.

11:02.074 --> 11:04.630
The same thief used these to
steal a dozen other paintings.

11:04.631 --> 11:06.339
These are his signature.
I know who took the Fist.

11:06.804 --> 11:07.625
It's Falco.

11:07.860 --> 11:09.695
Falco what?
Does he have a last name?

11:09.740 --> 11:11.168
No one knows.
He's never been caught.

11:11.169 --> 11:12.494
He's never even
been photographed.

11:12.523 --> 11:14.210
He's a top art thief in Europe,

11:14.211 --> 11:15.238
though he hasn't worked in years.

11:15.299 --> 11:16.692
Rumor was, he'd gotten
out of the game.

11:17.181 --> 11:19.755
Well, nothing like $50 million
to pull you out of retirement.

11:19.756 --> 11:21.650
Now that we have some direction,
I can get us some leads.

11:21.651 --> 11:23.315
- Great. Let's go.
- You can't come.

11:23.431 --> 11:24.783
I'm sorry.
You might have misunderstood

11:24.784 --> 11:25.980
the word "consultant."

11:26.240 --> 11:27.838
This is my case.

11:28.045 --> 11:29.605
The people there
won't talk to cops,

11:30.056 --> 11:31.204
but they'll talk to me.

11:33.968 --> 11:34.727
Where are you going?

11:35.107 --> 11:36.893
Uh, I'm not a cop, either.

11:39.292 --> 11:40.017
So...

11:41.803 --> 11:42.497
Fine.

11:45.994 --> 11:46.940
She's with us?

11:46.987 --> 11:48.068
Let's get a hold of Interpol.

11:48.069 --> 11:50.020
I want to find out everything
we can about Falco.

11:50.508 --> 11:52.056
You're an interesting man,
Mr. Castle--

11:52.072 --> 11:54.111
crime fighter by day,
mystery writer by night.

11:54.781 --> 11:56.416
You're pretty
interesting yourself.

11:56.791 --> 11:59.095
So are we meeting a
secret informant?

11:59.674 --> 12:02.037
Oh. I guess Beckett doesn't
just keep you around

12:02.038 --> 12:02.967
for your good looks.

12:04.176 --> 12:06.579
This place is as infamous
as it is anonymous.

12:06.580 --> 12:07.382
Serena.

12:08.370 --> 12:10.919
Why you been such a stranger?
You don't love me no more?

12:10.920 --> 12:12.732
Oh, Vin. I've been busy.

12:12.797 --> 12:15.579
Busy with what, Jason
Bateman over here?

12:15.580 --> 12:17.081
Hey, that got me out of
a speeding ticket once.

12:17.082 --> 12:18.913
Hey, Vin. This is time sensitive.

12:18.914 --> 12:20.105
We can play catch-up later.

12:20.211 --> 12:21.055
Right now I need to know

12:21.056 --> 12:22.532
if anyone's moving D
flawless diamonds,

12:22.533 --> 12:23.345
a lot of them.

12:23.837 --> 12:24.670
Time frame?

12:24.814 --> 12:26.574
They might have hit the market
as early as last night.

12:26.931 --> 12:27.866
These babies hot?

12:28.124 --> 12:29.229
Like a supernova.

12:32.540 --> 12:33.413
Can't help you.

12:41.045 --> 12:41.755
Well...

12:41.788 --> 12:43.488
you know, there was--
there was a guy

12:44.264 --> 12:46.350
who came my way a few days ago,

12:46.400 --> 12:47.710
was real cagey-like.

12:48.401 --> 12:50.265
Tried to take my temp
on a piece of art

12:50.266 --> 12:52.558
covered with a crapload
of flawless D's.

12:53.494 --> 12:55.447
Yeah, some sort of marble
hand or something.

12:55.849 --> 12:57.178
This guy, what did he look like?

12:58.696 --> 13:00.852
Serena was right.
Falco's a badass.

13:01.214 --> 13:02.586
Look how fat his
Interpol file is.

13:03.689 --> 13:05.771
He lifted a Renoir from
the Pushkin in '96

13:05.772 --> 13:07.406
and a Monet in '99,

13:07.679 --> 13:09.296
always using an ISI.

13:09.395 --> 13:11.361
Doesn't look like Falco's
killed anybody before.

13:11.490 --> 13:13.068
First time for
everything, I guess.

13:13.069 --> 13:14.747
Yeah, especially when
Hayes stood between him

13:14.748 --> 13:15.699
and $50 million.

13:15.700 --> 13:18.301
Though according to Interpol,
Falco doesn't steal for himself.

13:18.531 --> 13:20.187
He's more of a gun for hire.

13:20.199 --> 13:22.301
Someone wants a Picasso,
he boosts it for 'em.

13:22.370 --> 13:24.146
Which gives us a second
path to our killer.

13:24.472 --> 13:27.189
If we can't find Falco, then
we look for whoever hired him

13:27.190 --> 13:28.189
to steal the Fist.

13:28.314 --> 13:29.620
I'll tell you who hired him.

13:30.096 --> 13:33.292
Anton McHugh, my
son-of-a-bitch husband.

13:36.957 --> 13:39.003
The Fist belongs to me and Anton.

13:39.410 --> 13:41.539
We loaned it to the museum
from our collection.

13:41.891 --> 13:43.432
Why would your husband steal it?

13:44.258 --> 13:45.385
To screw me over.

13:45.386 --> 13:46.782
Right, but you said
that he owns it.

13:47.034 --> 13:48.395
He owns half of it.

13:48.870 --> 13:50.531
You were going through a divorce.

13:50.889 --> 13:52.344
Oh, we keep up appearances,

13:52.442 --> 13:53.997
mostly because neither
of us will give up

13:53.998 --> 13:55.232
the Fifth Avenue apartment.

13:56.089 --> 13:56.849
But this?

13:57.272 --> 13:59.194
This time, Anton
has hit a new low.

13:59.360 --> 14:01.110
So then you're fighting
over the Fist?

14:01.538 --> 14:02.840
I think it should
stay in the museum.

14:03.705 --> 14:04.599
It's a work of art.

14:04.720 --> 14:06.056
It should be enjoyed
by the public.

14:06.686 --> 14:08.076
Right, but your
husband's not on board.

14:08.194 --> 14:09.387
There's an understatement.

14:09.808 --> 14:11.904
At our last meeting with
the divorce attorneys,

14:12.066 --> 14:13.514
he screamed at me that he would

14:13.515 --> 14:15.558
get the Fist back by
any means necessary.

14:15.984 --> 14:17.688
Yeah, but saying that
he wanted the Fist back

14:17.689 --> 14:20.146
doesn't necessarily mean that
he hired someone to steal it.

14:20.436 --> 14:21.679
Yes, it does,

14:22.181 --> 14:24.020
because he's tried
to steal it before.

14:25.648 --> 14:28.517
Mr. McHugh, a curious incident
happened two weeks ago

14:28.518 --> 14:31.812
when the "Fist Of Capitalism"
was on its way to the museum.

14:32.127 --> 14:34.237
Two men claiming to be
from the moving company

14:34.238 --> 14:35.470
tried to intercept it.

14:35.674 --> 14:37.589
My understanding is, that was

14:37.590 --> 14:39.652
a bit of a mixup.

14:41.055 --> 14:43.803
Now there were no charges filed,

14:43.804 --> 14:46.138
but both men had long
criminal histories.

14:46.156 --> 14:47.874
I had nothing to do with this.

14:49.124 --> 14:51.560
Never even so much as
made contact with them.

14:51.591 --> 14:54.023
But interestingly, your
divorce lawyer did.

14:54.024 --> 14:55.678
Made lots of phone
calls to the men

14:55.679 --> 14:57.219
right before this mixup.

14:57.479 --> 14:58.418
Where's Falco?

14:59.154 --> 14:59.749
Who?

15:00.078 --> 15:02.446
After your first failed
attempt to steal the Fist,

15:02.447 --> 15:04.653
you decided to hire a
better class of thief.

15:04.654 --> 15:05.796
Unfortunately, he ended up

15:05.797 --> 15:07.647
killing Bryan Hayes
in the process.

15:07.648 --> 15:09.425
Which makes you an
accessory to murder.

15:09.827 --> 15:10.486
What?

15:11.494 --> 15:12.584
You're out of your mind.

15:12.729 --> 15:13.509
Wait a second.

15:13.832 --> 15:15.288
I'll bet Joy is behind this.

15:15.351 --> 15:16.981
Trust me, Mr. McHugh,

15:17.655 --> 15:19.315
your divorce is gonna be
the least of your problems

15:19.316 --> 15:21.069
if you don't tell
us where Falco is.

15:21.072 --> 15:22.722
I never heard of any Falco,

15:22.723 --> 15:24.886
and I didn't take the
Fist, all right?

15:25.089 --> 15:27.864
The truth is, I didn't
even want the damn thing.

15:28.160 --> 15:30.322
I just wanted Joy to
think I wanted it.

15:30.390 --> 15:31.208
And why is that?

15:31.279 --> 15:32.288
I thought if I made Joy

15:32.289 --> 15:34.141
think it meant something to me,

15:34.479 --> 15:36.185
she'd give me the
vineyard in Napa.

15:37.766 --> 15:38.754
Now that it's gone...

15:39.237 --> 15:41.664
that bag of Botox is
gonna clean me out.

15:44.156 --> 15:44.992
So what do you think?

15:45.683 --> 15:46.439
You believe him?

15:48.506 --> 15:50.065
Well, e-either way,
we don't have enough

15:50.066 --> 15:52.628
to subpoena the McHughs'
financials to, uh--

15:52.629 --> 15:54.419
doesn't look like Falco
is working with McHugh.

15:54.624 --> 15:55.707
Well, who was he working with?

15:55.708 --> 15:58.104
The museum's director--
Bryan Hayes.

15:58.206 --> 15:59.104
Our victim?

15:59.144 --> 16:01.016
A man matching Hayes'
description met with

16:01.017 --> 16:02.558
Serena's contact a few days ago,

16:02.652 --> 16:05.110
asking about D flawless diamonds.

16:05.532 --> 16:06.880
So Hayes was in on the theft?

16:06.881 --> 16:08.692
He must have hired Falco
to steal the Fist.

16:08.693 --> 16:10.249
Yeah, only Falco
decided to keep it.

16:10.313 --> 16:11.303
So he murdered Hayes.

16:11.607 --> 16:13.968
If Hayes was a coconspirator,
that might lead us to Falco.

16:13.969 --> 16:15.625
Let's take a look at his,
um, financials--

16:15.656 --> 16:16.777
- The usual.
- Yeah.

16:17.019 --> 16:18.356
I'll work some of
my other sources,

16:18.357 --> 16:19.510
see if we can get a line on him.

16:19.511 --> 16:21.986
Oh, another jaunt into
Manhattan's seedy underbelly?

16:21.987 --> 16:22.707
Count me in.

16:23.169 --> 16:25.224
Sorry. No need for a
guy Friday on this one.

16:25.225 --> 16:27.247
I'll just be making phone
calls, boring stuff.

16:27.400 --> 16:28.225
But I'll catch you later?

16:28.226 --> 16:29.146
Catch me anytime.

16:34.744 --> 16:35.440
Kate...

16:41.059 --> 16:41.971
Really?

16:42.034 --> 16:43.922
An insurance investigator?

16:43.959 --> 16:46.298
A sexy insurance investigator.

16:46.299 --> 16:48.602
I think she'd make a great
character for my next book.

16:48.615 --> 16:51.377
Well, you seem rather
taken with her.

16:51.530 --> 16:52.413
I find her...

16:53.544 --> 16:54.428
impressive.

16:55.200 --> 16:56.071
What's she like?

16:57.139 --> 16:59.006
She's an uncooperative, cocky,

16:59.007 --> 17:00.801
stubborn know-it-all.

17:00.964 --> 17:02.344
But she is good at her job?

17:02.345 --> 17:03.986
Yeah, well, Castle
seems to think so.

17:04.771 --> 17:05.883
And that bothers you.

17:06.522 --> 17:08.083
Yes, of course it bothers me.

17:08.906 --> 17:09.557
Why?

17:10.239 --> 17:12.104
Because he's supposed to be...

17:20.932 --> 17:21.830
Be what?

17:23.065 --> 17:24.040
My partner.

17:24.723 --> 17:27.134
I mean, he's supposed
to be on my team.

17:27.135 --> 17:28.885
He's not supposed
to be all smitten.

17:29.023 --> 17:29.791
Smitten?

17:29.913 --> 17:32.486
Mother, I think "intrigued"
is a better word.

17:32.543 --> 17:33.860
So what's our next move?

17:35.236 --> 17:35.844
Move?

17:35.845 --> 17:37.724
Oh, Richard, honestly.

17:38.153 --> 17:40.208
Beckett has made it plain
that she's not available

17:40.209 --> 17:40.843
for now.

17:41.105 --> 17:42.372
And now you've met this woman.

17:42.373 --> 17:44.244
She's smart, she's
incredibly attractive,

17:44.245 --> 17:45.369
you're intrigued by her.

17:45.370 --> 17:46.726
Why not ask her out?

17:47.795 --> 17:49.118
It's complicated.

17:49.679 --> 17:51.066
Why is it complicated?

17:51.305 --> 17:52.845
You know why it's complicated.

17:53.176 --> 17:54.449
Only what you've told me.

17:55.871 --> 17:56.447
Kate...

17:58.083 --> 17:59.475
what are you really scared of?

18:01.254 --> 18:02.413
That he won't wait for you

18:03.758 --> 18:04.916
or that he will?

18:19.126 --> 18:19.814
Hey.

18:20.714 --> 18:23.010
Hey. I figured that
you were with Serena.

18:23.011 --> 18:25.079
No. She had a meeting with
her bosses this morning.

18:25.295 --> 18:27.337
Oh. So you already saw
her this morning.

18:27.353 --> 18:28.852
No. She texted me. Oh.

18:29.492 --> 18:30.932
You thought that we were--

18:30.933 --> 18:32.804
Yeah. I mean, you know,
it's pretty obvious

18:32.805 --> 18:33.974
that she really likes you, so...

18:34.400 --> 18:35.620
It is? Mm-hmm.

18:37.436 --> 18:38.524
So then you think

18:38.600 --> 18:39.274
I should...

18:41.053 --> 18:42.059
Pursue it?

18:44.435 --> 18:45.928
You know, I mean, suit yourself.

18:48.938 --> 18:51.286
That, uh, getaway
van the thief used?

18:51.287 --> 18:52.934
It was dumped in an
alley in Queens.

18:52.935 --> 18:53.588
Any prints?

18:53.589 --> 18:55.828
Nope. Wiped clean.
Very professional.

18:55.959 --> 18:58.091
But CSU did find traces
of that hair gel

18:58.092 --> 18:58.787
on the headrest.

18:58.788 --> 19:00.195
They're trying to ID
the manufacturer.

19:00.196 --> 19:01.803
Hey, Beckett, I got
that stuff on Hayes.

19:01.804 --> 19:04.024
Well, during the past year,
the guy has shelled out

19:04.025 --> 19:06.959
some major cash to pay for his
mother's long-term care bills.

19:06.960 --> 19:08.966
Financially, the man
was deep underwater.

19:09.160 --> 19:11.210
He probably thought the
Fist was his only solution.

19:11.211 --> 19:13.714
We also found some suspicious
e-mails on his laptop.

19:13.715 --> 19:15.964
Stuff about the museum's
security system.

19:16.217 --> 19:18.244
Tech traced them to
an anonymous account.

19:18.245 --> 19:19.894
Falco knows how to
cover his tracks.

19:19.950 --> 19:22.958
One of them mentions a meeting
the day before the heist.

19:22.962 --> 19:24.352
So if we can figure
out where they met,

19:24.572 --> 19:26.268
it might lead us to
Falco's identity.

19:26.476 --> 19:27.314
I'm guessing it took place

19:27.315 --> 19:29.502
some time between
12:00 and 2:00 P.M.

19:29.519 --> 19:31.194
Since that's the only time
Hayes left the museum.

19:31.195 --> 19:33.214
Wait a minute.
I got something on his phone records

19:33.215 --> 19:34.107
for that day.

19:35.197 --> 19:37.751
11:06 A.M.
he made a one-minute phone call

19:37.752 --> 19:39.254
to Ascana's restaurant.

19:39.339 --> 19:40.691
He was making reservations.

19:40.789 --> 19:42.421
How much you want to
bet it was for two--

19:43.159 --> 19:44.147
him and Falco?

19:44.957 --> 19:46.644
Sure. I remember Mr. Hayes.

19:46.815 --> 19:49.008
Three days ago.
They sat in a corner booth.

19:49.049 --> 19:50.444
So he was here with someone?

19:50.606 --> 19:51.510
Definitely.

19:51.511 --> 19:53.978
The two of them were having a
real intense conversation.

19:54.097 --> 19:56.385
Do you remember what
this person looked like?

19:56.781 --> 19:58.593
Uh, she was tall,

19:59.008 --> 19:59.865
blonde,

20:00.132 --> 20:00.956
gorgeous.

20:01.557 --> 20:03.323
Wait.
Hayes was here with a woman?

20:03.324 --> 20:06.196
That's right. She was in her
30's, but still really hot.

20:06.197 --> 20:07.295
Wait a minute.

20:07.388 --> 20:09.254
Did she look like...

20:09.357 --> 20:10.155
this?

20:10.156 --> 20:11.662
Yeah. That's her.

20:14.509 --> 20:15.822
It's Serena.

20:16.645 --> 20:17.990
She's our thief.

20:21.937 --> 20:23.163
No, no. Thank you.

20:23.769 --> 20:25.936
Hey. Just got off with
the insurance company.

20:25.937 --> 20:27.921
Guess what Serena did
before she worked for them.

20:27.922 --> 20:29.200
Kindergarten teacher?

20:29.201 --> 20:29.993
Art thief.

20:29.994 --> 20:31.142
Alleged art thief.

20:31.143 --> 20:31.698
Whatever.

20:31.738 --> 20:33.408
Suspected of pulling
off some major jobs

20:33.409 --> 20:34.872
between '01 and '06--

20:34.873 --> 20:37.376
Prado, Uffizi, Houston--

20:37.377 --> 20:39.433
but they could never
pin anything on her.

20:39.434 --> 20:41.752
Well, how the hell did she
end up working insurance?

20:41.753 --> 20:42.647
About five years ago,

20:42.648 --> 20:44.400
she went to the company and
said she wanted to make good.

20:44.401 --> 20:46.688
Even told 'em where they were
going wrong with their security.

20:46.689 --> 20:48.952
Let me guess. She suggested
that they all work together.

20:48.953 --> 20:50.288
Well, at least she's consistent.

20:50.289 --> 20:52.504
And nostalgic. Looks like she's
back to her old tricks again.

20:52.505 --> 20:54.305
Only now she's added
a new one--murder.

20:54.306 --> 20:56.384
That's why she knew how the
thief got into the museum.

20:56.385 --> 20:57.559
She was the thief.

20:57.560 --> 20:59.016
And then she partnered
up with us to steer us

20:59.017 --> 21:00.121
to the mythical Falco.

21:00.122 --> 21:01.192
She played me.

21:01.193 --> 21:03.147
Don't worry, Castle.
You're not the only one.

21:04.034 --> 21:04.816
She's in on it?

21:04.817 --> 21:06.265
Uh, we're not exactly sure, sir,

21:06.266 --> 21:07.792
but the evidence suggests--

21:07.793 --> 21:10.200
I want her in custody,
detective, now.

21:10.201 --> 21:11.592
Our case is circumstantial.

21:11.593 --> 21:13.032
Get something concrete.

21:13.033 --> 21:16.243
I will not have this department
publicly humiliated.

21:16.505 --> 21:17.548
Yes, sir.

21:20.905 --> 21:22.035
So where is she now?

21:22.553 --> 21:23.644
At her hotel.

21:24.922 --> 21:26.918
- She invited me for a drink.
- Did she?

21:27.301 --> 21:28.801
Doesn't look like she's
in a rush to leave town.

21:28.825 --> 21:29.465
Well...

21:29.480 --> 21:31.458
Well, then we
press our one advantage.

21:31.704 --> 21:33.078
She doesn't know we're on to her,

21:33.079 --> 21:34.950
so we make a run at her
without her finding out.

21:34.951 --> 21:36.166
And how are we gonna do that?

21:36.167 --> 21:37.062
Simple.

21:38.319 --> 21:40.231
Castle asks her out on a date.

21:40.869 --> 21:41.831
I do?

21:42.053 --> 21:43.655
It's what you wanted, isn't it?

21:44.149 --> 21:46.591
All you have to do is keep
her out of her room.

21:48.717 --> 21:51.156
And take her to the
restaurant at the hotel.

21:52.520 --> 21:53.312
Then...

21:53.313 --> 21:54.743
just show her a good time.

21:54.998 --> 21:56.054
Thank you.

21:57.348 --> 21:59.399
And while you keep
her occupied...

21:59.869 --> 22:01.462
we get into her room.

22:02.280 --> 22:03.940
So what am I doing on this date?

22:03.941 --> 22:04.972
Am I trying to...

22:04.973 --> 22:06.676
trip her up, get her to break?

22:06.677 --> 22:08.999
No, just stall her--
make some jokes,

22:09.368 --> 22:10.596
you know, small talk.

22:10.597 --> 22:13.012
The important thing is to keep
her out of her hotel room

22:13.013 --> 22:14.383
so we can search it.

22:14.493 --> 22:16.034
So what do you say, Castle?

22:16.035 --> 22:17.908
Think you can charm
her for an hour?

22:18.353 --> 22:19.489
Are you serious?

22:19.490 --> 22:20.674
Absolutely.

22:20.856 --> 22:22.304
I was gonna give
you one more day.

22:22.305 --> 22:23.799
And then you were gonna
ask me out yourself?

22:23.800 --> 22:24.931
Mm-hmm.

22:25.779 --> 22:27.024
Well, I'm a woman who believes in

22:27.025 --> 22:28.512
going after what she wants.

22:28.513 --> 22:29.651
I can see that.

22:29.865 --> 22:31.408
Besides, I hardly
made it a secret

22:31.409 --> 22:32.313
that I was attracted to you,

22:32.314 --> 22:34.217
and I could tell you felt
the same way about me.

22:34.218 --> 22:35.150
Well, looks like
neither one of us

22:35.151 --> 22:36.977
are very good at keeping secrets.

22:40.120 --> 22:41.369
Nothin' so far.

22:41.855 --> 22:42.930
You find anything?

22:46.383 --> 22:47.481
No.

22:47.863 --> 22:51.897
Hmm. You really want to
nail this chick, don't you?

22:52.015 --> 22:53.062
Yeah, well,

22:53.063 --> 22:56.072
it's what we do, isn't
it, catch bad guys?

22:56.918 --> 22:58.172
Yeah, but...

22:59.536 --> 23:01.483
seems like it might be
about more than that.

23:03.333 --> 23:05.046
Just keep lookin', okay?

23:05.139 --> 23:06.554
So why choose to be

23:06.555 --> 23:08.482
an insurance investigator?

23:08.483 --> 23:10.123
It's really not something
most little girls

23:10.124 --> 23:11.609
aspire to be when they grow up.

23:11.610 --> 23:13.570
It's a recent career change.

23:13.791 --> 23:14.722
Really?

23:14.743 --> 23:16.217
What did you do before?

23:16.440 --> 23:17.898
Actually, I was a thief.

23:19.231 --> 23:20.265
Get out.

23:20.279 --> 23:21.814
Well, that's what the
museums like to call me.

23:21.815 --> 23:24.451
I prefer to think of myself
as an art retriever.

23:24.576 --> 23:25.826
What's the difference?

23:26.327 --> 23:28.262
Well, the pieces I took
had already been stolen

23:28.263 --> 23:29.878
from their rightful owners--

23:29.879 --> 23:32.455
taken by Nazis,
despots, governments.

23:32.456 --> 23:33.918
Just because a piece
is in a museum

23:33.919 --> 23:35.473
doesn't mean it belongs there.

23:36.279 --> 23:37.198
Seriously?

23:37.199 --> 23:40.406
I specialized in returning art
to their rightful owners,

23:40.407 --> 23:42.063
starting with a small Rembrandt

23:42.064 --> 23:44.138
an SS officer took
from my grandfather.

23:45.551 --> 23:47.666
So you were kinda like the, uh,

23:47.831 --> 23:48.998
female Indiana Jones,

23:48.999 --> 23:51.376
only without the hat and whip.

23:51.377 --> 23:53.538
Well, without the hat.

23:56.391 --> 23:57.817
It's gettin' hot in here.

24:26.672 --> 24:28.041
I have an idea.

24:29.719 --> 24:31.345
Why don't we skip dessert?

24:31.939 --> 24:33.767
Oh, well... what's the rush?

24:33.768 --> 24:37.506
I hear the strawberry
shortcake here is excellent.

24:38.335 --> 24:39.711
Wouldn't you rather
come up to my room

24:39.712 --> 24:40.850
for a drink?

24:41.111 --> 24:43.104
The, uh, strawberries

24:43.105 --> 24:45.130
are supposed to be really fresh.

24:45.887 --> 24:47.033
Well, great.

24:47.528 --> 24:49.721
We can order them
from room service...

24:50.279 --> 24:52.002
with extra whip cream.

25:06.352 --> 25:07.986
I think I found something.

25:10.743 --> 25:13.657
It's a message between Serena
and a bunch of fences.

25:13.847 --> 25:16.722
Guess who's trying to
sell D flawless diamonds.

25:17.594 --> 25:19.492
I think I found something, too--

25:19.567 --> 25:21.185
the tools of the trade.

25:22.488 --> 25:24.616
As well as an ISI.

25:25.256 --> 25:26.266
Mm.

25:29.608 --> 25:30.861
There it is.

25:31.259 --> 25:32.983
The skyline suite.

25:41.201 --> 25:42.284
Hey!

25:45.161 --> 25:46.857
What--what are you doing here?

25:46.858 --> 25:48.603
Arresting you for theft...

25:49.403 --> 25:50.580
and murder.

25:58.202 --> 25:59.452
Wait. So now you're telling me

25:59.453 --> 26:01.255
that you don't believe
she's in on this?

26:01.256 --> 26:02.716
Why would she tell
me she's a thief?

26:02.717 --> 26:03.661
Why offer that up?

26:03.662 --> 26:05.501
Because she's feeding
you just enough truth

26:05.502 --> 26:07.593
so that swallowing
the lies is easier.

26:07.594 --> 26:08.872
I don't think she's behind this.

26:08.873 --> 26:10.696
Yeah, well, you're thinking
with the wrong body part.

26:10.697 --> 26:12.208
It was only a kiss.

26:12.209 --> 26:14.672
I was doing what you told me to,
keeping her occupied.

26:14.673 --> 26:16.112
I was trying to give
you enough time

26:16.113 --> 26:17.384
so that you could
search her room.

26:17.385 --> 26:19.536
Yes, the room-- the
room where we found

26:19.537 --> 26:21.153
the suitcase and the e-mail,

26:21.154 --> 26:23.376
which all stands as evidence
against her right now.

26:23.377 --> 26:26.240
I just think we should give
her a chance to explain.

26:26.241 --> 26:27.252
We? No, there is no way

26:27.253 --> 26:29.126
we're going in on the
interrogation together.

26:29.127 --> 26:30.335
Oh, come on.

26:30.336 --> 26:32.039
I'm sorry, Castle, but right now,

26:32.040 --> 26:34.735
based on this conversation and
your behavior in that hotel,

26:34.736 --> 26:37.206
it is obvious that you
have been compromised.

26:37.207 --> 26:38.439
I was only doing...

26:39.453 --> 26:40.968
what you asked.

26:51.046 --> 26:52.527
I thought I'd sit this one out.

26:58.053 --> 26:59.004
I gotta hand it to you.

26:59.005 --> 27:01.215
This whole long con
you've got going...

27:01.613 --> 27:02.855
It's impressive.

27:02.989 --> 27:04.788
Cozying up to
insurance companies,

27:04.789 --> 27:06.816
telling them that you
want to go straight,

27:06.817 --> 27:09.109
all the while waiting
for your next score.

27:09.110 --> 27:10.495
What are you talking about?

27:10.496 --> 27:14.075
The only catch was that
you knew you needed Hayes

27:14.076 --> 27:16.006
but you knew you couldn't
get away with it

27:16.007 --> 27:16.893
if you let him live,

27:16.894 --> 27:19.684
so you insinuated yourself
into my investigation

27:19.685 --> 27:21.284
to cover your tracks.

27:21.285 --> 27:24.264
And here I thought Rick was
the only writer on your team.

27:24.354 --> 27:26.856
Rick? You guys on a
first-name basis now?

27:26.989 --> 27:28.016
Well...

27:28.172 --> 27:30.116
he was making out with her
in the hotel hallway.

27:30.117 --> 27:31.884
Beckett told me to stall her.

27:31.885 --> 27:33.502
She also tell you to use tongue?

27:33.964 --> 27:35.770
I don't need to spin stories.

27:35.771 --> 27:37.829
I've got you meeting Bryan Hayes

27:37.830 --> 27:39.731
the day before the heist.

27:39.732 --> 27:41.514
Yes, to go over
security for the gala.

27:41.515 --> 27:42.258
He was concerned.

27:42.259 --> 27:43.042
Concerned?

27:43.043 --> 27:44.138
He was involved.

27:44.139 --> 27:46.298
I didn't know that it was
all an act at the time.

27:46.299 --> 27:47.730
If that meeting was so innocent,

27:47.731 --> 27:49.442
then why didn't you tell
us about it before?

27:49.443 --> 27:51.778
Because it's not like I'm
particularly proud of the fact

27:51.779 --> 27:53.323
that I didn't figure
out what he was up to.

27:53.324 --> 27:55.163
If I had, then the sculpture
wouldn't be stolen,

27:55.164 --> 27:56.426
and he might still be alive.

27:56.427 --> 27:57.858
Man, she's really
selling the whole

27:57.859 --> 27:59.541
"thief with a heart of gold" act.

27:59.779 --> 28:01.346
Maybe it's not an act.

28:01.347 --> 28:02.666
She is being really
calm in there.

28:02.667 --> 28:04.358
Yeah, like strangely calm.

28:04.412 --> 28:05.838
Maybe she didn't do it.

28:06.101 --> 28:09.028
Either that or she's a
psychopath, in which case...

28:09.029 --> 28:10.457
you sure can pick 'em.

28:10.589 --> 28:12.196
We found the tools that you used

28:12.197 --> 28:13.380
to break in to the museum--

28:13.381 --> 28:14.957
the rope, grappling hook,

28:14.958 --> 28:15.788
lock picks.

28:15.789 --> 28:17.180
I specialize in recovery.

28:17.181 --> 28:18.709
The insurance companies
don't care how

28:18.710 --> 28:20.716
I get the pieces back,
just that I do.

28:20.717 --> 28:22.555
So basically, you're
still a thief.

28:22.556 --> 28:24.308
Recovery, not theft.

28:24.309 --> 28:26.596
And what part of recovery
involves trying to sell

28:26.597 --> 28:28.916
D flawless diamonds
on the black market?

28:28.917 --> 28:30.621
Falco may try to
move those stones.

28:30.622 --> 28:32.989
I was trying to flush out
his possible fences.

28:32.990 --> 28:35.349
Listen, I've done my
homework on you, detective.

28:35.350 --> 28:37.268
I know that you're a
smart, methodical cop

28:37.269 --> 28:38.527
with great instincts.

28:38.528 --> 28:40.684
And those instincts are
telling you right now

28:40.685 --> 28:42.149
that I'm innocent.

28:42.150 --> 28:43.628
For some reason,
you're ignoring them.

28:43.629 --> 28:44.863
Why is that?

28:51.165 --> 28:54.293
Ms. Kaye, your job is
recovery, as you call it.

28:54.294 --> 28:56.863
My job is to solve this homicide.

28:57.326 --> 28:59.829
Then why don't you put
aside your personal agenda

28:59.883 --> 29:01.443
and ask me for my alibi

29:01.444 --> 29:03.155
so we can move on with
this investigation?

29:03.156 --> 29:05.636
For the record, I was
in a business meeting

29:05.637 --> 29:07.965
with one of my bosses
when I got the call...

29:08.324 --> 29:09.653
if you want to check.

29:09.972 --> 29:11.606
If you're telling the truth,

29:12.158 --> 29:13.954
then why have you been
going behind our backs?

29:13.955 --> 29:17.191
Because in my experience, the
police just get in the way.

29:17.819 --> 29:20.621
My job's to recover the
sculpture, not play nice.

29:21.052 --> 29:21.738
But you're right.

29:21.739 --> 29:24.363
I've been treating this like a
regular case, and it's not.

29:24.364 --> 29:27.374
So I promise, from here
on out, no more secrets.

29:27.660 --> 29:28.627
It won't be necessary.

29:28.628 --> 29:30.773
We won't be working
together anymore.

29:32.459 --> 29:35.557
Would it change your mind if I
told you, I know who Falco is?

29:41.755 --> 29:42.834
What you're watching right now

29:42.835 --> 29:44.275
is security footage
from the museum exhibit

29:44.276 --> 29:45.426
from two weeks ago.

29:45.427 --> 29:48.626
You stole Hayes' flash drive?
That's why it went missing?

29:48.627 --> 29:50.459
Remember, you're trying
to get us to trust you.

29:50.460 --> 29:52.066
At least I meant it
when I kissed you.

29:52.067 --> 29:53.306
It wouldn't have
done you any good.

29:53.307 --> 29:54.718
You wouldn't know
what to look for.

29:55.675 --> 29:57.150
You see that guy right there?

29:57.505 --> 29:58.835
He's casing the joint.

29:58.836 --> 29:59.842
How can you tell?

29:59.843 --> 30:00.899
Trust me. I can tell.

30:00.900 --> 30:02.602
- So you're saying that's--
- Falco.

30:02.603 --> 30:04.140
Well, why didn't you
tell us this before?

30:04.141 --> 30:05.658
Well, I just didn't get
a chance to show you.

30:05.659 --> 30:07.194
- I guess you were busy.
- Okay, okay.

30:07.195 --> 30:09.203
Perhaps we can just focus
on getting this guy.

30:09.204 --> 30:10.069
Well, how's this
supposed to help?

30:10.070 --> 30:11.760
We don't even know his real name.

30:12.086 --> 30:14.556
Well, the only thing we can do
is send photos out to TSA

30:14.557 --> 30:15.478
and put out an APB.

30:15.479 --> 30:16.902
Otherwise, without
more information,

30:16.903 --> 30:18.262
it's not gonna do us any good.

30:18.263 --> 30:20.618
What if I could tell you which
hotel he was staying at?

30:20.840 --> 30:23.335
The gel in the vents and on
the headrest of the van?

30:23.336 --> 30:25.750
CSU identified it as
a proprietary formula

30:25.751 --> 30:27.489
made exclusively for
the Wessex hotel.

30:27.490 --> 30:28.590
There's only one in the city.

30:28.591 --> 30:30.326
Let's get the photos out
to the hotel employees.

30:30.327 --> 30:32.554
If one of them recognizes
him, we got him.

30:32.695 --> 30:33.681
Right on.

30:45.017 --> 30:45.892
- NYPD!
- NYPD!

30:45.915 --> 30:47.048
Let me see your hands!

30:47.087 --> 30:48.158
Let me see your hands right now!

30:48.189 --> 30:49.404
Hands, right now!

30:50.684 --> 30:51.923
Hello, Falco.

30:56.524 --> 30:57.631
Falco?

30:58.293 --> 31:00.367
I've got no idea what
you're talking about.

31:00.813 --> 31:02.860
My name is Holt. William Holt.

31:02.861 --> 31:04.966
Yes, William Holt,
British passport.

31:04.967 --> 31:06.740
You just got into
town two weeks ago.

31:06.741 --> 31:08.996
You also happened
to be in Bilbao

31:08.997 --> 31:11.694
ten years ago when the
Pissarro went missing,

31:11.717 --> 31:14.051
and then in Berlin 15 years ago

31:14.052 --> 31:16.231
when that El Greco disappeared.

31:17.237 --> 31:18.452
Don't know anything about that.

31:18.453 --> 31:20.239
Drop the act, Falco.

31:20.320 --> 31:22.628
We've got a video of
you casing the museum

31:22.629 --> 31:23.943
two weeks ago.

31:24.126 --> 31:25.846
That is you, isn't it?

31:26.054 --> 31:27.525
Whenever I come to a new town,

31:27.526 --> 31:31.103
I always take time out to
admire the city's treasures.

31:31.268 --> 31:32.679
Is that a crime?

31:33.048 --> 31:34.253
No, no.

31:34.254 --> 31:37.094
But sneaking back in
and stealing them is.

31:37.245 --> 31:38.367
Look familiar?

31:38.845 --> 31:40.060
It was used to disarm

31:40.061 --> 31:42.367
the security systems
in the museum.

31:42.429 --> 31:45.033
They also found matching
ones in Bilbao and Berlin.

31:45.423 --> 31:46.625
If you say so.

31:46.895 --> 31:49.729
I, for one, have never
seen anything like that.

31:51.199 --> 31:52.617
The hotel that you're staying it,

31:52.618 --> 31:54.417
it's nice, isn't it?

31:54.647 --> 31:57.554
They even have their very own
exclusive hair products.

31:58.119 --> 32:00.014
Hair products that left a trace

32:00.015 --> 32:01.960
in the air duct system.

32:01.966 --> 32:04.657
And by the way, uh... hair gel?

32:04.719 --> 32:05.841
Not very manly.

32:08.992 --> 32:11.835
Hundreds of people are
staying at my hotel,

32:12.055 --> 32:14.422
and I'm pretty sure

32:14.423 --> 32:16.613
you didn't find prints on that.

32:16.614 --> 32:17.713
So...

32:17.959 --> 32:21.489
what exactly were you
planning to book me on?

32:23.383 --> 32:26.809
This Falco person
you're chasing...

32:27.839 --> 32:29.969
are you sure he's your guy?

32:31.402 --> 32:33.784
From what I know about
him, he's no murderer.

32:35.064 --> 32:37.209
He may not be as
involved as you think.

32:41.831 --> 32:43.473
He's trying to tell us something.

32:43.663 --> 32:45.287
Yeah, to politely go to hell.

32:45.288 --> 32:47.920
No, he went out of his way to
tell us, he's not the murderer.

32:47.921 --> 32:49.839
Well, most people do
that in the room.

32:49.840 --> 32:51.871
CSU come back with
anything from the hotel?

32:51.872 --> 32:52.924
Nothing.

32:53.136 --> 32:54.953
No equipment, no Fist.

32:56.095 --> 32:57.249
What are you thinking?

32:57.335 --> 32:58.697
He knows something.

32:59.336 --> 33:00.238
But he can't tell us

33:00.239 --> 33:01.866
without admitting he was there.

33:03.239 --> 33:04.545
Let me talk to him.

33:04.592 --> 33:05.775
You're kidding, right?

33:05.776 --> 33:07.951
He's a suspect, and
you're not even a cop.

33:07.952 --> 33:10.093
No, I'm a thief, like him.

33:10.495 --> 33:11.673
He'll talk to me.

33:17.655 --> 33:18.650
Whoa.

33:19.129 --> 33:20.263
Bad cop struck out,

33:20.264 --> 33:21.807
good cop gets a turn?

33:21.808 --> 33:23.010
I'm not a cop.

33:24.317 --> 33:25.476
Then who are you?

33:26.678 --> 33:28.480
That depends on who you ask.

33:28.678 --> 33:30.980
I'm Der Geist in Zurich,

33:30.981 --> 33:33.180
Pantera in Spain.

33:33.181 --> 33:35.519
Police nationale
know me as Gaston.

33:36.181 --> 33:37.410
But you...

33:38.008 --> 33:40.176
probably know me as...

33:40.405 --> 33:41.481
Jackal.

33:42.722 --> 33:43.907
The Prado.

33:44.713 --> 33:45.779
'07?

33:46.601 --> 33:48.130
Are you saying that was you?

33:48.131 --> 33:49.141
Mm-hmm.

33:49.350 --> 33:51.943
How'd you get by
the sound sensors?

33:51.944 --> 33:55.479
I had the Russian build me
a wave cancellation box.

33:55.613 --> 33:58.008
I heard he built one for
you for the Boston job?

33:58.054 --> 33:59.964
That's no easy exit, Prado.

33:59.965 --> 34:01.735
How did you get the piece out?

34:03.342 --> 34:06.060
The guard was so busy
checking out my assets

34:06.061 --> 34:07.173
that he didn't notice me

34:07.174 --> 34:08.994
cut the trip wire
on the Goya's back.

34:08.995 --> 34:11.870
I came in later on a skyline
and whipped it right out.

34:12.492 --> 34:13.887
I'll be damned.

34:19.284 --> 34:20.878
But now you're here,

34:21.203 --> 34:22.837
working with the cops.

34:23.322 --> 34:24.754
So you must have got caught.

34:24.755 --> 34:26.277
Mm. I got smart.

34:26.451 --> 34:27.445
One day you realize

34:27.446 --> 34:30.118
that you or someone else
is going to get hurt.

34:32.339 --> 34:33.878
I didn't kill him.

34:34.498 --> 34:35.637
But you were there.

34:43.755 --> 34:45.293
Think she'll get him to talk?

34:47.116 --> 34:47.955
Who knows, Castle?

34:47.956 --> 34:49.733
Maybe she'll kiss it out of him.

34:53.286 --> 34:55.503
I wasn't hired to steal the Fist.

34:55.504 --> 34:57.599
My contact told me
that I was being paid

34:57.600 --> 34:59.873
to test their security
for vulnerabilities.

34:59.874 --> 35:03.009
I was to break in,
disable the alarm,

35:03.010 --> 35:05.346
and walk out undetected,
all before 10:00 P.M.

35:05.347 --> 35:06.627
And for my trouble,

35:07.441 --> 35:09.844
I got 200 grand in advance.

35:10.314 --> 35:11.444
Who hired you?

35:11.675 --> 35:12.994
Oh, church and state, love.

35:12.995 --> 35:14.859
Everything goes through
a third party.

35:14.860 --> 35:16.490
You know that.
It's safer that way.

35:16.491 --> 35:18.131
Mm. Yeah, until you get set up.

35:18.132 --> 35:20.570
The real thief needed you
to disable the alarms.

35:20.571 --> 35:21.829
Yeah, apparently.

35:22.821 --> 35:23.886
What'd you see?

35:24.075 --> 35:25.422
Nothing at first.

35:26.043 --> 35:27.039
I mean...

35:27.958 --> 35:29.379
it had all been too easy.

35:29.380 --> 35:31.195
I got halfway back
to the loading bay

35:31.196 --> 35:32.387
when it hit me--

35:32.388 --> 35:34.822
I mean, I'd already
disabled the alarms, right?

35:35.043 --> 35:38.227
And it was just,
oh, sitting there.

35:38.228 --> 35:39.584
You went back for the Fist.

35:39.585 --> 35:42.315
It's an awful lot of
temptation, $50 mil.

35:44.249 --> 35:45.026
When I got back to the room,

35:45.027 --> 35:48.005
there was a woman walking
toward the Fist.

35:48.324 --> 35:50.078
So I got the bloody
hell outta there.

35:50.300 --> 35:51.823
This woman, what
did she look like?

35:51.824 --> 35:53.422
I barely got a glimpse.

35:53.788 --> 35:55.509
All I can say for sure is,

35:55.651 --> 35:57.453
she was wearing a black dress.

35:59.892 --> 36:01.067
Come on, Beckett.

36:01.068 --> 36:02.515
He's got no reason to lie.

36:02.516 --> 36:05.147
He's a thief.
He's got plenty of reasons to lie.

36:05.148 --> 36:06.371
Not about this.

36:06.372 --> 36:07.986
He knows you've got
nothing on him.

36:07.987 --> 36:10.002
All he had to do was wait, and
you'd have to release him.

36:10.003 --> 36:11.458
If Falco is telling the truth,

36:11.459 --> 36:13.011
then with Hayes' money trouble,

36:13.012 --> 36:15.587
the $200,000 payment to
Falco rules him out.

36:15.588 --> 36:17.963
Then why would he go to the bar,
asking about fencing diamonds?

36:17.964 --> 36:18.759
Because he was paranoid

36:18.760 --> 36:20.339
someone was trying
to steal the Fist.

36:20.340 --> 36:22.118
Not paranoid. Right.

36:22.119 --> 36:23.406
Which means our killer's probably

36:23.407 --> 36:25.702
whomever Falco saw going in
to the room with the Fist.

36:25.703 --> 36:27.954
And when Hayes got in the
way, she spiked him.

36:28.008 --> 36:29.951
Did he say anything about
what the woman looked like?

36:29.952 --> 36:32.106
Just that she was
wearing a black dress.

36:32.184 --> 36:34.448
There were over 200
people at that gala,

36:34.449 --> 36:36.337
and half of those women
were wearing black.

36:36.338 --> 36:37.133
And more importantly,

36:37.134 --> 36:38.655
if she didn't leave
by the loading dock,

36:38.656 --> 36:40.817
then how did she get the
Fist out of the museum?

36:41.384 --> 36:43.470
Yeah. How did she?

36:43.471 --> 36:46.095
She waits for Falco to
finish disabling the system,

36:46.096 --> 36:47.877
and then she comes
in through the gala.

36:47.878 --> 36:49.789
And with the alarm
system deactivated,

36:49.790 --> 36:50.916
she grabs the Fist.

36:50.917 --> 36:53.175
But Hayes is paranoid
about security,

36:53.176 --> 36:55.703
so he comes in to
check on the exhibit.

36:56.142 --> 36:57.311
He catches her...

36:57.773 --> 36:59.461
and she's forced to kill him.

36:59.462 --> 37:00.980
Now she's in a hurry to leave

37:00.981 --> 37:03.701
before someone discovers her
with the Fist and a body.

37:03.702 --> 37:05.148
Ah, but she can't take
it out through the gala

37:05.149 --> 37:06.116
without being spotted...

37:06.117 --> 37:07.510
And she can't take it
through the loading bay

37:07.511 --> 37:09.414
without one of the catering staff

37:09.415 --> 37:11.182
noticing her dressed in black.

37:11.183 --> 37:12.998
Well, those are the
only two exits.

37:12.999 --> 37:15.218
And both of those choices
leave too much to chance.

37:15.219 --> 37:16.495
She would've easily
gotten caught.

37:16.496 --> 37:17.831
So if she can't take
it through the gala

37:17.832 --> 37:19.318
and she can't take it
through the loading bay,

37:19.319 --> 37:21.046
how the hell did she
get it outta here?

37:21.047 --> 37:22.329
Maybe she didn't.

37:22.599 --> 37:23.617
What do you mean?

37:23.967 --> 37:25.553
What I mean is...

37:29.319 --> 37:30.876
What are you doing?!

37:31.411 --> 37:33.211
It never left the museum.

37:34.857 --> 37:36.949
Mr. Castle.

37:37.282 --> 37:39.534
Looks like I broke
this case wide open.

37:47.468 --> 37:49.205
You needed to see me, detective?

37:49.540 --> 37:52.165
Yes, we need to talk to you
about your installation.

37:52.523 --> 37:54.074
Oh, my God. What happened?

37:54.075 --> 37:55.363
It's a new interpretation

37:55.364 --> 37:56.131
I'm working on.

37:56.132 --> 37:58.547
I call it... busted.

37:58.548 --> 38:00.580
It's ruined.
Who the hell did this?

38:00.581 --> 38:03.070
More to the point, who
put the Fist in it?

38:03.228 --> 38:04.491
The Fist was inside it?

38:04.492 --> 38:06.251
That way, the thief
didn't have to worry

38:06.252 --> 38:07.159
about smuggling it out.

38:07.160 --> 38:09.626
She could simply
rejoin the party.

38:09.920 --> 38:10.736
She?

38:10.737 --> 38:12.566
We know that whoever
stole the Fist

38:12.567 --> 38:14.182
was a woman wearing
a black dress--

38:14.183 --> 38:16.302
the same woman that
killed Mr. Hayes.

38:16.303 --> 38:18.002
If I remember correctly,

38:18.175 --> 38:20.287
you were wearing a black
dress that night.

38:20.288 --> 38:22.350
So was every woman in here.

38:22.351 --> 38:24.551
Yes, but only one of them knew
that there was a compartment

38:24.552 --> 38:26.369
inside that piece nearby.

38:26.656 --> 38:27.870
It was the perfect plan

38:27.871 --> 38:30.671
until Bryan Hayes
showed up and saw you.

38:30.672 --> 38:32.698
Wait. I-it wasn't me.

38:32.999 --> 38:33.671
I swear.

38:33.672 --> 38:35.367
You mean, it wasn't just you.

38:35.368 --> 38:36.938
You didn't have the
money to pay Falco,

38:36.939 --> 38:38.186
but you did use your position

38:38.187 --> 38:39.844
to place the piece
in the exhibit.

38:39.845 --> 38:41.854
I didn't place anything.

38:41.963 --> 38:43.802
My piece was selected
by the board,

38:43.803 --> 38:45.427
just like all of the art in here.

38:45.428 --> 38:47.115
Yes, and when the
exhibit was done,

38:47.116 --> 38:48.250
it would come back to you,

38:48.251 --> 38:50.315
only worth about
$50 million more.

38:50.316 --> 38:51.955
No, it wasn't coming back to me.

38:51.956 --> 38:54.229
I sold it last week.
It was going to...

38:56.372 --> 38:57.422
Oh, my God.

39:00.291 --> 39:02.542
I found Alyssa's work compelling.

39:02.772 --> 39:05.387
I'm not sure why I'm having
to justify my taste in art.

39:05.388 --> 39:08.206
Because this particular
piece just happened to have

39:08.207 --> 39:10.025
a bronze Fist in it.

39:10.584 --> 39:11.679
You found my Fist.

39:11.680 --> 39:13.433
Yes, right where you put it.

39:14.239 --> 39:16.167
You know, right about now is
where you should be thinking

39:16.168 --> 39:18.958
about whether pushing Hayes
was an accident or not,

39:18.959 --> 39:19.691
because that's gonna make

39:19.692 --> 39:22.405
a 30-year difference in
your prison sentence.

39:22.420 --> 39:24.779
You think I did that
to Bryan Hayes?

39:24.780 --> 39:27.147
Now we've obtained a warrant
for your financials,

39:27.148 --> 39:29.659
and we will find
evidence of the $200,000

39:29.660 --> 39:31.658
you paid to William Holt,

39:31.659 --> 39:34.082
also known as Falco,
to disable security

39:34.083 --> 39:35.326
at the museum.

39:36.299 --> 39:38.029
I'm sorry, dear. You've lost me.

39:38.188 --> 39:40.514
CSU found your fingerprints
all over the Fist.

39:40.515 --> 39:42.596
Of course they did.
It belongs to me.

39:42.597 --> 39:45.309
Bloody fingerprints-- his blood,

39:45.310 --> 39:46.709
your prints.

39:47.364 --> 39:48.437
It's over.

39:48.443 --> 39:50.397
You killed a man, Mrs. McHugh.

39:53.364 --> 39:54.670
You don't understand.

39:55.268 --> 39:57.606
My husband was going
to take it away.

39:58.420 --> 40:00.262
I just took what was
rightfully mine.

40:00.275 --> 40:02.299
Bryan Hayes showed
up out of nowhere.

40:02.300 --> 40:04.309
He saw me with the
Fist in my hands.

40:04.587 --> 40:06.077
What was I supposed to do?

40:08.164 --> 40:09.805
You know what's ironic?

40:10.723 --> 40:13.874
Your husband would've
let you have the Fist.

40:13.875 --> 40:15.790
He didn't even want it.

40:21.011 --> 40:23.786
The DA said that her husband
called several times,

40:23.787 --> 40:26.643
begging to testify against her.

40:26.644 --> 40:28.834
Mm. When can I collect the Fist?

40:28.835 --> 40:30.059
The insurance company's asking.

40:30.060 --> 40:31.227
Well, it's in evidence.

40:31.228 --> 40:34.159
Once the case is resolved,
they'll release it.

40:35.677 --> 40:36.951
I want to thank you.

40:37.280 --> 40:38.845
I couldn't have done
this without you.

40:38.846 --> 40:40.136
I'm really grateful.

40:40.230 --> 40:42.629
So does that mean you're cutting
me in on the finder's fee?

40:42.630 --> 40:44.007
I'm not that grateful.

40:44.589 --> 40:46.816
Well, I, uh...

40:49.582 --> 40:52.191
think we all ended up
with what we wanted.

40:52.366 --> 40:53.351
Yeah.

40:53.446 --> 40:55.211
Um, you know...

40:55.774 --> 40:58.172
after you and Castle
went on that date--

40:58.173 --> 40:59.579
More like a sting.

40:59.934 --> 41:03.216
He... never thought
that you were involved.

41:03.578 --> 41:04.884
Oh.

41:05.997 --> 41:08.193
He believed in you,
even when I didn't.

41:09.588 --> 41:11.082
Why are you telling me this?

41:11.904 --> 41:13.503
I just--I, I think
that you should know

41:13.504 --> 41:15.260
what kind of person
you're dealing with.

41:17.776 --> 41:19.049
Here we are, ladies.

41:20.258 --> 41:21.037
Thank you.

41:21.106 --> 41:21.814
Thank you.

41:24.628 --> 41:25.702
Anything wrong?

41:25.802 --> 41:27.334
Uh, no. I should--

41:27.396 --> 41:29.215
I'm just gonna go and
file some stuff.

41:32.091 --> 41:34.286
Uh, and I'm--I'm going
back to my hotel.

41:34.599 --> 41:35.635
I would ask you to come,

41:35.636 --> 41:37.795
but... it's like I said,

41:37.796 --> 41:40.190
I don't steal things that
belong to someone else.

41:49.460 --> 41:50.806
You guys didn't go out?

41:51.418 --> 41:52.588
No.

41:54.561 --> 41:55.587
Why?

41:56.193 --> 41:57.585
Because I can't afford it.

41:57.586 --> 41:59.184
The museum just slapped
me with a bill

41:59.185 --> 42:00.779
for that exhibit I broke.

42:01.361 --> 42:01.969
Whoa.

42:01.970 --> 42:03.993
I know.
You'd think they cut me slack

42:03.994 --> 42:06.421
after the whole "helping to
solve the murder" thing.

42:06.946 --> 42:08.620
I guess the least
the NYPD could do

42:08.621 --> 42:10.519
is take you out for a hamburger.

42:12.942 --> 42:14.048
I accept.

42:15.021 --> 42:15.994
Let's go.

42:18.502 --> 42:20.107
I could put Alexis
through college on this.

42:20.108 --> 42:21.640
Yeah, and med school.

42:22.566 --> 42:23.896
Thank God I'm rich.
