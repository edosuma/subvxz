WEBVTT

00:13.221 --> 00:15.015
- A new Door opened
because of me.

00:15.056 --> 00:17.892
- Only a Bloodherd
can close it.

00:17.934 --> 00:19.310
- Fuck my life.

00:23.440 --> 00:26.568
- We're in this together.
Okay?

00:26.609 --> 00:29.487
- Find and return her at once.

00:29.529 --> 00:31.322
- This mineral is called
Devil's Bone.

00:31.364 --> 00:32.741
It's not gold.

00:32.782 --> 00:34.159
- What more can I lose?

00:34.200 --> 00:35.368
- If we close that tear,

00:35.410 --> 00:37.203
cut them
off of Gehenna's influence,

00:37.245 --> 00:38.705
they stand a chance at getting
back to normal.

00:58.558 --> 01:01.311
- River seepage?

01:01.353 --> 01:04.189
- It'd be ugly.
This whole thing could cave.

01:11.696 --> 01:13.823
Take what we can,
while we can, boys.

01:13.865 --> 01:17.118
We'll be set for life.
No more of this shit.

01:17.160 --> 01:19.287
- Yeah!

01:21.706 --> 01:23.792
- Closing the tear
should get us Nolan back.

01:23.833 --> 01:26.294
- Okay, here...

01:26.336 --> 01:29.005
is the tear,

01:29.047 --> 01:30.507
and here is the entrance.

01:30.548 --> 01:33.760
- We need to get those workers
out of the gallery.

01:33.802 --> 01:35.220
- My Dad had me
do this ride-along

01:35.261 --> 01:36.638
when I was, like, seven.

01:36.680 --> 01:38.682
Pointed out these
station thingies

01:38.723 --> 01:41.017
that had
these emergency levers.

01:41.059 --> 01:42.435
They trigger an evacuation.

01:42.477 --> 01:44.479
- What if they don't leave?

01:44.521 --> 01:46.481
You saw your Dad.
It was an obsession.

01:46.523 --> 01:48.733
- Tasha.

01:48.775 --> 01:51.194
- If they don't dip,
WPN will force them out.

01:51.236 --> 01:52.612
I mean, it's protocol.

01:52.654 --> 01:55.240
And then we slip in
like a couple of sly eels.

01:55.281 --> 01:56.908
You close the tear
with your ledger thingie,

01:56.950 --> 01:59.452
and you save Nolan from being
a blood-thirsty monster.

02:01.162 --> 02:04.082
What? What's going on?

02:04.124 --> 02:05.417
- Shh.

02:33.028 --> 02:35.572
See ya, nerds!
Whoo-hoo!

03:29.626 --> 03:32.087
- Wild no one knows
what's coming.

03:32.128 --> 03:34.381
- They never will.

03:36.299 --> 03:38.093
- See that baseball field
over there?

03:38.134 --> 03:40.095
Prospector's diamond.

03:40.136 --> 03:42.889
West Pine's holy land.

03:42.931 --> 03:44.557
"Can you feel the power?"

03:44.599 --> 03:46.935
- Yeah,
it's, like, very bright.

03:48.937 --> 03:50.522
- You know, when I was seven,
my Dad's guy Paul

03:50.563 --> 03:52.774
drunkenly lit a bottle rocket
off his butthole.

03:52.816 --> 03:54.401
- Right back there.

03:55.860 --> 03:58.446
- Yeah. All the local
636 crew gathered.

03:58.488 --> 04:00.615
And it just--it didn't go off.

04:00.657 --> 04:03.243
- It just, like,
exploded in his ass.

04:03.284 --> 04:04.953
It was so funny.
We were dying.

04:04.994 --> 04:08.081
- It just exploded in there?
- Yes.

04:08.123 --> 04:10.250
Flames. Sparks.

04:10.291 --> 04:12.794
Dying. Dying.

04:12.836 --> 04:16.047
Same night Mom got me
my first ice cream cone.

04:16.089 --> 04:18.049
Mint chocolate chip.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.342
And then I got salmonella,

04:19.384 --> 04:21.177
and the next few weeks
were spent on the toilet.

04:21.219 --> 04:23.763
- Oh.
- But it was worth it.

04:23.805 --> 04:27.183
Mom joked I was shooting
more sparks than Paul.

04:28.309 --> 04:30.103
- Shooting sparks?
- Yes.

04:30.145 --> 04:32.814
Kaboom, like...

04:32.856 --> 04:34.816
- Tasha.
- Dude, it was a mess.

04:34.858 --> 04:38.778
- Tasha, you are such a liar.
You love this town.

04:40.905 --> 04:43.158
- I don't know.
In my head, it's, like...

04:43.199 --> 04:47.370
Mom died here.

04:47.412 --> 04:48.913
And no one talks
about her anymore.

04:48.955 --> 04:51.833
And, like, so,
what was her life worth?

04:51.875 --> 04:54.336
Like, she was just this chick
from a small town

04:54.377 --> 04:57.088
that no one knew about?

04:57.130 --> 05:01.176
I can--I can, like,
feel that silence.

05:05.138 --> 05:07.724
Dude, West Pine's a shithole.

05:07.766 --> 05:09.517
- Yes.

05:09.559 --> 05:12.729
- Everyone is a stupid asshole.
Like...

05:12.771 --> 05:13.772
- Yes.

05:13.813 --> 05:15.315
- And your Colony sucks, bro.

05:15.357 --> 05:16.691
- Definitely.

05:18.360 --> 05:20.528
- But it's home.

05:24.908 --> 05:27.911
Fuck you, West Pine!
I love you!

05:27.952 --> 05:29.287
- My ear!

05:29.329 --> 05:31.831
- Fuck your ears!
I love you!

05:33.583 --> 05:36.878
- Fuck you, the Disciples!
I love you!

05:36.920 --> 05:40.173
- Fuck you, Big Chris
and Little Chris and Spoons!

05:40.215 --> 05:41.341
I love you!

05:41.383 --> 05:43.426
- Fuck you, Gehenna,
I love you!

05:43.468 --> 05:45.929
Fuck you, the Colony,
I love you!

05:55.438 --> 05:57.440
- What is that thing?

06:05.115 --> 06:06.449
- Ready?

06:06.491 --> 06:08.159
- Yeah, definitely.

06:09.369 --> 06:10.954
- You don't have
to go in there.

06:10.995 --> 06:12.664
- You know I do.

06:12.706 --> 06:14.416
What's your plan
actually entail?

06:14.457 --> 06:17.877
- Just say some words.
The tear to Gehenna closes up.

06:17.919 --> 06:19.879
- You just say, "Some words?"

06:19.921 --> 06:22.465
- They're really good words.

06:30.765 --> 06:32.100
- That's not good.

06:32.142 --> 06:33.351
- What is it?

06:33.393 --> 06:35.645
- Spoons said the tunnel
could cave in the river.

06:35.687 --> 06:37.022
That's how the Frisks
won their case.

06:37.063 --> 06:38.898
They said it could flood
the whole mine.

06:38.940 --> 06:40.734
- The Colony gets their water
from that river.

06:40.775 --> 06:42.110
- So does all of West Pine.

06:42.152 --> 06:44.571
- If the water mixes with
that Devil's Bone,

06:44.612 --> 06:47.198
the entire town
could end up like your Dad.

06:47.240 --> 06:50.618
- Or Nolan, right?

06:50.660 --> 06:52.162
Why is it so quiet down here?

07:02.839 --> 07:06.217
- Well, I think
I found your answer.

07:06.259 --> 07:07.677
- Looks like we improvise.

07:09.471 --> 07:12.474
- Attention. Critical flooding
risk has been detected.

07:12.515 --> 07:14.517
You must evacuate.

07:40.418 --> 07:42.879
- Nolan?

07:46.675 --> 07:48.593
- I need you to hide for me.

07:48.635 --> 07:50.595
Okay?

07:52.263 --> 07:53.932
Go, Tasha.

08:39.185 --> 08:40.979
- Carrie, no.

08:45.400 --> 08:47.193
Hey.

08:47.235 --> 08:49.571
Hey. Girl boss.

08:49.612 --> 08:52.282
Superstar. Muse.

08:52.323 --> 08:55.368
I know you're in there.

08:55.410 --> 08:57.662
I'm gonna save you, okay?

09:02.959 --> 09:05.420
- Oh, my God!

09:20.143 --> 09:21.227
- No!

09:31.654 --> 09:32.822
- Sorry, Superstar.

09:46.086 --> 09:47.462
So close.

09:47.504 --> 09:50.048
- I'm shaking. Look.

09:51.383 --> 09:54.177
- Ready to get our friend back?
- Uh-huh.

10:01.935 --> 10:04.312
- You sure this'll work?

10:04.354 --> 10:06.564
- No. Not at all.

10:06.606 --> 10:10.318
But we don't have a choice.
Calm mind, steady hand.

10:12.946 --> 10:16.408
- Oh, my God.
Be strong. Almost there.

10:16.449 --> 10:19.536
Once I get this thing out,
you will be you again.

10:19.577 --> 10:20.745
- Nolan, we're here.

10:31.673 --> 10:33.425
- Gotcha.

10:35.343 --> 10:37.095
- Nolan.

10:38.430 --> 10:41.433
- I'm sorry, Tasha.

10:42.851 --> 10:44.894
- It worked.
- Attention.

10:44.936 --> 10:49.107
If anybody else still remains,
you must leave immediately.

10:49.149 --> 10:52.694
Gallery eight
is about to flood.

10:52.736 --> 10:54.195
- Okay. I'll lure him out.

10:54.237 --> 10:56.448
You perform the ritual
before it's too late.

10:56.489 --> 10:59.034
- Wait.
Ah.

10:59.075 --> 11:01.036
I wanna say something big,
but my mind is in puddles,

11:01.077 --> 11:04.581
and I just--
it's like bluh, mush, I--

11:04.622 --> 11:06.082
- What about an "I love you?"

11:06.124 --> 11:07.876
- I need to say
something perfect.

11:07.917 --> 11:09.836
Perfect last words.

11:09.878 --> 11:11.588
- What?

11:14.591 --> 11:17.385
- Go, Tasha.

11:17.427 --> 11:18.845
Go.

11:24.976 --> 11:28.813
- C'mon. You can do it.

11:28.855 --> 11:30.774
I believe in you.

12:14.109 --> 12:15.568
- Only a member of
the Bloodherd

12:15.610 --> 12:17.404
can open up a new Door.

12:19.823 --> 12:22.575
- So only a member
of the Bloodherd can close it.

12:39.759 --> 12:42.095
- C'mon.

12:42.137 --> 12:45.140
Come and get me.

12:45.181 --> 12:47.142
I'm right here.

12:56.860 --> 12:58.987
Oh, my God.

12:59.029 --> 13:01.448
Nolan? Nolan!

13:03.700 --> 13:07.203
- Nolan. Nolan.

13:13.835 --> 13:16.796
- Vast Gehenna, I pray to thee.

13:16.838 --> 13:20.550
Close your Door
and set me free.

13:28.266 --> 13:30.894
Vast Gehenna, I pray to thee.

13:30.935 --> 13:35.482
Close your Door
and set me free.

13:35.523 --> 13:38.651
- Which is why you must join
the Bloodherd.

13:38.693 --> 13:41.279
- Join the Bloodherd.

13:41.321 --> 13:43.948
Pig, pig, pig, pig, pig,
pig, pig, pig.

13:43.990 --> 13:46.826
- You're just rotting flesh.

13:46.868 --> 13:48.870
Join the Bloodherd.

13:48.912 --> 13:51.831
- Vast Gehenna, I pray to thee.

13:51.873 --> 13:54.250
Close your Door
and set me free.

13:54.292 --> 13:56.795
- You're rotting flesh.
Rotting flesh.

13:56.836 --> 13:59.464
- Vast Gehenna, I pray to thee.

13:59.506 --> 14:02.676
Close your Door
and set me free.

14:15.689 --> 14:17.023
- Please be okay.
Please be okay.

14:17.065 --> 14:20.235
Please be okay.
Nolan. Nolan.

14:23.697 --> 14:27.158
- Hey.

14:27.200 --> 14:30.662
I'm literal stink bait.

14:32.080 --> 14:34.332
You should smell my pits.

14:34.374 --> 14:37.002
No perfume. No shower.

14:37.043 --> 14:40.505
Don't. Rhetorical.

14:40.547 --> 14:43.258
- Second hell
you've saved me from.

14:45.218 --> 14:48.471
I'm so glad I didn't hurt you.

14:48.513 --> 14:49.681
I-I wouldn't be able
to live with--

14:49.723 --> 14:53.309
- I'm gonna kiss you now.
Like, a kiss-kiss.

14:53.351 --> 14:57.313
On the lips.
Good?

14:57.355 --> 15:00.692
- Yeah.
Good.

15:00.734 --> 15:03.862
Wait.

15:03.903 --> 15:07.115
Fuck it.

15:07.157 --> 15:10.577
I'm non-binary.

15:10.618 --> 15:12.328
- Oh.

15:12.370 --> 15:16.624
- Like, genderqueer.

15:16.666 --> 15:19.210
Enby.
A "them."

15:19.252 --> 15:22.380
- Your timing is unreal.

15:22.422 --> 15:24.132
- I know.
- I know.

15:24.174 --> 15:26.426
You're goddamn perfect,
Nolan Frisk.

15:29.471 --> 15:31.890
both: Cool.

15:39.439 --> 15:42.150
- Vast Gehenna, I pray to thee!

15:42.192 --> 15:45.362
Close your Door
and set me free!

15:53.328 --> 15:55.747
- Come home, Carrie.

15:55.789 --> 15:57.707
Come home.

16:27.654 --> 16:31.741
- Your friends found sanctuary
in each other

16:31.783 --> 16:34.285
while you are left alone.

16:34.327 --> 16:38.331
No parents. No home.

16:38.373 --> 16:42.502
But you are never alone
in hatred.

16:42.544 --> 16:46.423
We see through
your bitter bones.

16:46.464 --> 16:50.343
We see your sour heart beating.

16:52.345 --> 16:57.392
Your blood
is the pestilent stream.

17:00.812 --> 17:05.150
Your family is the Herd.

17:05.191 --> 17:09.362
And you are vast Gehenna.

17:11.281 --> 17:13.366
- But you're wrong.

17:15.243 --> 17:16.828
I found a home.

17:20.290 --> 17:23.209
I reject you.
- Save yourself.

17:23.251 --> 17:25.837
- I reject you.
- Save yourself.

17:25.879 --> 17:28.590
Save yourself. Save yourself.
- I reject you.

17:28.631 --> 17:31.384
- Save yourself. Save yourself!
- I reject you!

17:45.231 --> 17:48.109
Vast Gehenna, I pray to thee!

17:48.151 --> 17:51.738
Close your Door.
Set me free!

18:40.120 --> 18:43.498
Set me free.

19:32.130 --> 19:34.883
- Warmth, daughter.

19:34.924 --> 19:37.886
You did it.

19:37.927 --> 19:40.847
You're safe now.

19:40.889 --> 19:42.891
You're a hero.

19:42.932 --> 19:44.934
Our angel awakens.

19:48.104 --> 19:49.939
Disciples.

19:49.981 --> 19:54.319
It is with great pride that
I welcome back our guardian,

19:54.361 --> 19:57.530
Carrie Lavinia Ecker.

19:57.572 --> 20:01.576
She learned of a tear
between our world and Gehenna,

20:01.618 --> 20:05.955
and she risked everything
to stop it--

20:05.997 --> 20:07.624
her skin,

20:07.665 --> 20:11.127
reputation at home,

20:11.169 --> 20:15.465
bending her own principles

20:15.507 --> 20:21.304
in order to save thousands.

20:21.346 --> 20:23.473
In offering herself up
in sacrifice,

20:23.515 --> 20:28.645
she has truly become
an angel of the dawn.

20:28.687 --> 20:31.314
A hero is born.
So, marvel.

20:31.356 --> 20:34.150
- A hero.
- Hero.

20:34.192 --> 20:37.612
- My daughter.

20:37.654 --> 20:42.325
We are prepared to offer you
Arthur Deane's old post--

20:42.367 --> 20:43.827
liaison to the guardians,

20:43.868 --> 20:47.664
free to move
between our world and others.

20:47.706 --> 20:50.375
How does that strike you?

20:53.086 --> 20:54.462
Mm?

20:54.504 --> 20:56.423
She accepts.

21:05.015 --> 21:08.476
Just one final test.

21:08.518 --> 21:12.022
Disciples.

21:17.569 --> 21:20.196
And warmth.

21:25.785 --> 21:27.412
Our tradition states
that outsiders

21:27.454 --> 21:29.539
must not know our ways.

21:29.581 --> 21:33.460
Carrie, display your devotion.

21:33.501 --> 21:37.422
Prove your love.
You know what to do.

21:45.889 --> 21:49.434
- My blade was lost
in the mine.

21:56.066 --> 21:59.986
- I trust you, daughter.

22:11.498 --> 22:14.876
- Humanity has wilted.

22:14.918 --> 22:18.213
Out there,
they poison the land.

22:18.254 --> 22:22.759
They build chambers
of self-obsession,

22:22.801 --> 22:27.013
and always choose the one
over the many.

22:27.055 --> 22:28.473
And still...

22:30.975 --> 22:35.188
They had the nerve to confide

22:35.230 --> 22:38.441
their pathetic problems to me.

22:44.155 --> 22:47.617
Their stupid crisis
of identity.

22:54.833 --> 22:59.504
Her petty grief--
an orgy of vanity.

23:01.881 --> 23:03.425
Do one better, father.

23:03.466 --> 23:05.552
Show them all that we sacrifice

23:05.593 --> 23:08.346
so they can live
their empty lives.

23:08.388 --> 23:13.518
Teach them our love.

23:13.560 --> 23:15.645
Feed them to Gehenna.

23:19.691 --> 23:22.819
You spoke of trust.

23:53.808 --> 23:56.561
- To vast Gehenna,
I give my skin.

23:56.603 --> 23:58.605
Pray warm shadow, let me in.

24:08.865 --> 24:11.743
- No.
No!

24:11.785 --> 24:14.537
- Carrie. Carrie, please.
We won't talk.

24:14.579 --> 24:16.873
You know we won't.
Carrie.

24:16.915 --> 24:19.167
Carrie, please.
We won't talk. Tell them.

24:19.209 --> 24:20.752
- Try not to scream.
- Tell them, Carrie.

24:20.794 --> 24:22.379
- You'll survive longer.

24:22.420 --> 24:24.631
- Please. Carrie, please.

24:26.091 --> 24:27.884
- Carrie!

24:30.178 --> 24:33.098
Carrie!

24:35.433 --> 24:36.893
Carrie!

24:36.935 --> 24:38.728
- Please.
We won't talk, you know that.

24:38.770 --> 24:40.563
Tell them, please!
