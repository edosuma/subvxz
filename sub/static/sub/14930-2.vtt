WEBVTT

00:04.772 --> 00:07.208
I HAVE TO GET
IN THE BATHROOM!

00:08.509 --> 00:09.543
OH, YUCK.

00:09.577 --> 00:10.444
WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

00:10.478 --> 00:12.513
SAME THING
THAT'S HAPPENED
EVERY MORNING

00:12.546 --> 00:14.248
SINCE MOM'S
BEEN PREGNANT.

00:14.282 --> 00:15.683
PUKEFEST '04.

00:16.617 --> 00:19.120
GUESS I'LL BE PEEING
IN THE BACKYARD AGAIN.

00:19.153 --> 00:20.188
LOVELY.

00:20.221 --> 00:21.822
ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS,
LET'S GIVE YOUR DAD
SOME ROOM.

00:21.855 --> 00:24.058
OK? HE'S HAD
ANOTHER ROUGH MORNING.

00:24.092 --> 00:25.826
I'M GONNA GET YOU
SOME GINGER ALE.

00:25.859 --> 00:29.297
DAD, IS THERE
NOWHERE ELSE
YOU COULD DO THIS?

00:29.330 --> 00:31.665
YOU'RE RIGHT, BABY.
IT'S SO RUDE OF ME

00:31.699 --> 00:33.667
TO BLOW CHUNKS
IN A LARGE
BOWL OF WATER

00:33.701 --> 00:36.737
THAT DRAINS DIRECTLY
TO THE SEWER.

00:38.406 --> 00:40.208
OH, GOD!

00:40.241 --> 00:41.008
WHAT IS IT?

00:41.041 --> 00:43.077
IT'S BRAD. HE'S
COMIN' UP OUR WALK.

00:43.111 --> 00:45.179
WHAT THE HELL'S
HE DOIN' HERE?
THEY BROKE UP.

00:45.213 --> 00:46.514
I DON'T KNOW.

00:46.547 --> 00:49.217
OH...HE'S
AT THE DOOR.
WHAT DO WE DO?

00:49.250 --> 00:50.251
SOMEBODY
GONNA GET THAT?

00:50.284 --> 00:51.652
OH, IT--IT'S
A JEHOVAH'S WITNESS.

00:51.685 --> 00:53.121
WE'RE JUST GONNA
WAIT HIM OUT.

00:53.154 --> 00:54.722
Go.

00:54.755 --> 00:56.190
HELLO.
HEY, BRAD.

00:56.224 --> 00:57.291
MR. AND MRS. FINNERTY.

00:57.325 --> 00:59.227
YOU READY TO GO?
YEAH.

00:59.260 --> 00:59.927
BYE, GUYS.

00:59.960 --> 01:00.628
WHOA. WAIT.
I THOUGHT YOU GUYS

01:00.661 --> 01:01.729
WERE READY
TO KILL EACH OTHER.

01:01.762 --> 01:05.199
WE WERE. BUT THEN
WE DECIDED TO BE
MATURE ABOUT THIS.

01:05.233 --> 01:06.267
[EXHALES
EXASPERATEDLY]

01:06.300 --> 01:07.535
'SCUSE ME.

01:07.568 --> 01:09.170
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

01:09.203 --> 01:10.304
I'M WALKING
TO SCHOOL.

01:10.338 --> 01:11.439
SCHOOL'S THAT WAY.

01:11.472 --> 01:13.274
YES, BUT IF YOU'RE
GOING THAT WAY,
I'M GOING THIS WAY.

01:13.307 --> 01:17.211
OH. SO YOU'RE GONNA
GO AROUND THE WORLD
TO GET TO SCHOOL?

01:17.245 --> 01:18.879
IF I HAVE TO!

01:18.912 --> 01:19.913
SO, WHAT,

01:19.947 --> 01:22.216
ARE WE NEVER GONNA WALK
TO SCHOOL TOGETHER AGAIN?

01:22.250 --> 01:24.885
ALL RIGHT. WELL...
IT'S ONLY WALKING.

01:24.918 --> 01:27.188
YEAH.
IT'S NOT LIKE
WE'RE DATING AGAIN.

01:27.221 --> 01:29.257
NO! NO! WE--
WE CAN'T DATE AGAIN.

01:29.290 --> 01:31.659
WE--WE CHEATED
ON EACH OTHER.

01:31.692 --> 01:35.163
I KNOW. BROKE
EACH OTHER'S HEARTS.

01:35.196 --> 01:36.264
EXACTLY.

01:37.231 --> 01:39.267
BUT WE COULD
BE FRIENDS WHO...

01:39.300 --> 01:41.669
WALK TO SCHOOL
TOGETHER.

01:42.170 --> 01:44.205
YEAH. ALL RIGHT.
YEAH. SOUNDS GOOD.

01:44.238 --> 01:45.639
ALL RIGHTY!

01:45.673 --> 01:48.142
YOU WANNA CARRY
MY BOOKBAG, FRIEND?

01:48.176 --> 01:50.711
I'D LOVE TO...
FRIEND.

01:50.744 --> 01:51.879

MINE?

01:51.912 --> 01:53.181

01:53.214 --> 01:54.348
BUT--

01:54.382 --> 01:56.284
WELL, I'M GLAD YOU GUYS
WORKED THINGS OUT.

01:56.317 --> 01:58.719
YEP. NOW WE DON'T
HAVE TO BAD-MOUTH
EACH OTHER

01:58.752 --> 02:00.521
TO EVERYONE
AT SCHOOL.

02:00.554 --> 02:02.423
WHAT? YOU'VE BEEN
DOING THAT?

02:02.456 --> 02:05.159
WE'RE GONNA BE LATE.

02:08.729 --> 02:12.733
HEY, SEAN.
YOU MISSED COMEDY NIGHT
AT THE BAR LAST NIGHT.

02:12.766 --> 02:14.902
YEAH. I WAS TOO BUSY
PUKING MY GUTS OUT.

02:14.935 --> 02:19.640
SEAN, YOU'RE CHASING
AN UNREALISTIC IMAGE
OF MALE BEAUTY.

02:19.673 --> 02:22.210
I'M SICK, YOU IDIOT.

02:22.676 --> 02:23.577
CLAUDIA,
YOUR FRIEND FAYE

02:23.611 --> 02:25.846
CAME TO DO SOME COMEDY
AT THE BAR LAST NIGHT.

02:25.879 --> 02:27.515
OH, YOU'RE KIDDING.
HOW'D SHE DO?

02:27.548 --> 02:28.882
SHE HAD HER MOMENTS.

02:28.916 --> 02:32.420
OK, OUR NEXT COMIC
IS A VERY FUNNY LADY...

02:32.453 --> 02:33.621
NAMED FAYE.

02:33.654 --> 02:35.823
GIVE IT UP
FOR FAYE.

02:38.592 --> 02:40.261
EDDIE.

02:40.894 --> 02:42.930
DO YOU NOT
RECOGNIZE ME?

02:42.963 --> 02:46.667
'COURSE I DO.
YOU'RE...FAYE.

02:46.700 --> 02:49.203
THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

02:49.237 --> 02:52.373
THE RUDEST MAN
IN AMERICA!

02:53.006 --> 02:54.808
THE INSULT COMEDY
OF FAYE!

02:54.842 --> 02:55.643
HOW ABOUT A HAND?

02:55.676 --> 02:58.679
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU DON'T REMEMBER ME.

02:58.879 --> 03:00.981
WE DATED FOR,
LIKE, A MONTH?

03:01.014 --> 03:03.384
WE BOUGHT A HAMSTER
TOGETHER?!

03:03.417 --> 03:05.519
OH. MARLON.

03:05.553 --> 03:07.921
OH, SO YOU REMEMBER
THE HAMSTER'S NAME!

03:07.955 --> 03:09.857
HE DIDN'T SCREAM AT ME!

03:09.890 --> 03:11.191
YOU KNOW WHY
YOU DON'T REMEMBER ME?

03:11.225 --> 03:14.762
IT'S BECAUSE I WAS
THE ONLY RELATIONSHIP
THAT YOU COULDN'T CONTROL.

03:14.795 --> 03:17.731
YOU DON'T KNOW ME...

03:18.266 --> 03:19.066
FAYE.

03:19.099 --> 03:21.969
OK. IN THE 3 YEARS
SINCE WE HAVE DATED,

03:22.002 --> 03:24.272
HOW MANY RELATIONSHIPS
HAVE YOU HAD?

03:24.305 --> 03:26.440
LIKE...80!

03:26.774 --> 03:29.777
YOU REALIZE YOU'RE
PROVING MY POINT, RIGHT?

03:30.043 --> 03:32.246
HO HO HO,
YOU'RE SO SMART.

03:32.280 --> 03:34.282
YOU ARE SO SMART.

03:34.315 --> 03:35.283
MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST...

03:35.316 --> 03:40.388
GO AND...GO OUT
AND GET A COFFEE
OR SOMETHING.

03:40.421 --> 03:41.789
SURE. WHY NOT?

03:41.822 --> 03:43.657
YEAH. THANKS

03:52.433 --> 03:53.934

YOU LIKE SPORTS?

04:25.899 --> 04:27.901

04:28.969 --> 04:29.803
REALLY?!
YEAH!

04:29.837 --> 04:31.004
WHAT SPORTS

04:31.038 --> 04:32.906
OH, YOU--
BASEBALL,

04:32.940 --> 04:36.043
UH, FOOTBALL...
WATER BALL...

04:36.076 --> 04:37.945
W...WATER POLO?

04:37.978 --> 04:39.880
YEAH. WELL...
WATER POLO.

04:39.913 --> 04:41.081
I PLAYED
AT MY OLD SCHOOL.

04:41.114 --> 04:42.950
WHAT POSITION
DO YOU PLAY?

04:42.983 --> 04:44.718
LEFT.

04:44.752 --> 04:46.487
PINCHER.

04:49.990 --> 04:52.493
HEY, BABE.
I'M GOIN' OUT
FOR A JOG.

04:52.526 --> 04:53.461
BABY,
YOU'RE PREGNANT.

04:53.494 --> 04:56.730
OH. YOU'RE RIGHT.
WE'RE GOIN' OUT
FOR A JOG.

04:56.764 --> 04:58.065
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

04:58.098 --> 05:00.901
I'M TELLING YOU,
SINCE I'VE BEEN PREGNANT,
I FEEL LIKE A NEW WOMAN.

05:00.934 --> 05:03.371
I HAVE ALL THIS ENERGY.
I FEEL GREAT.

05:03.404 --> 05:04.972
RUB IT IN.
I FEEL LIKE CRAP.

05:05.005 --> 05:09.543
OH. WELL, MAYBE
MAMA'S GOT THE CURE
FOR WHAT AILS YOU.

05:09.577 --> 05:12.045
OH, BABY, COME ON.
I'M STILL FEELIN'
QUEASY.

05:12.079 --> 05:14.047
AND BESIDES, WE GOT
THIS KID COMIN'
IN 8 MONTHS,

05:14.081 --> 05:15.583
AND THE ONLY THINGS
WE OWN FOR A BABY

05:15.616 --> 05:16.584
ARE A BUNCH
OF DIRTY OLD CLOTHES

05:16.617 --> 05:18.686
AND THIS MOBILE
THAT SPARKS WHEN
YOU PLUG IT IN

05:18.719 --> 05:23.491
AND A BUNCH OF PACIFIERS
THAT HENRY BIT
THE NIPPLES OFF OF!

05:24.124 --> 05:25.959
OK...

05:28.662 --> 05:29.930
OUCH.

05:29.963 --> 05:32.766
OH, GOD. WILL YOU
PUT THAT BEER AWAY, ED?

05:32.800 --> 05:35.669
I CAN'T STAND
THE SMELL, MAN.

05:36.003 --> 05:37.838
SEAN...
YOU LOVE BEER.

05:37.871 --> 05:40.007
YEAH. I KNOW. YEAH,
THAT'S WHAT'S SO WEIRD.

05:40.040 --> 05:41.909
LATELY, EVERYTHING'S
MAKING ME QUEASY,

05:41.942 --> 05:44.612
AND I'M IRRITABLE,
AND I GOT CRAMPS.

05:46.547 --> 05:47.347
CRAMPS.

05:47.381 --> 05:50.818
SOUNDS LIKE YOU GOT
COUVADE SYNDROME.

05:51.652 --> 05:52.786
WHAT ARE YOU TALKIN' ABOUT?

05:52.820 --> 05:54.455
SYMPATHETIC PREGNANCY.
IT'S BROUGHT ON

05:54.488 --> 05:56.857
BY THE STRESS OF HAVIN'
A BABY ON THE WAY.

05:56.890 --> 06:00.628
LOOK, I DON'T HAVE STRESS
ABOUT THE BABY. ALL RIGHT?
I'M JUST SICK.

06:00.661 --> 06:01.495
MEN WHO GET COUVADE

06:01.529 --> 06:04.498
HAVE ELEVATED LEVELS
OF FEMALE HORMONES.

06:04.532 --> 06:06.500
IF YOU WANT TO FIND OUT
IF YOU HAVE IT,

06:06.534 --> 06:07.968
YOU SHOULD TAKE
A PREGNANCY TEST.

06:08.001 --> 06:10.804
YEAH. THANKS FOR
THE MEDICAL ADVICE,
ALL RIGHT?

06:10.838 --> 06:12.473
BUT I'M NOT PEEIN'
ON A STICK! OK?

06:12.506 --> 06:14.742
I DON'T HAVE STRESS!
I DON'T HAVE FEMALE HORMONES!

06:14.775 --> 06:17.678
I DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER
WOMANLY PROBLEMS.
YOU GOT IT?

06:17.711 --> 06:20.848
I CAN'T TALK TO YOU
WHEN YOU'RE
THIS EMOTIONAL.

06:22.015 --> 06:24.618
HELLO, TAYA.

06:24.652 --> 06:26.954
IT'S NICE
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

06:26.987 --> 06:30.558
PERHAPS YOU'D LIKE
TO DANCE WITH ME?

06:33.627 --> 06:35.663
OH. WHAT DO YOU KNOW.

06:35.696 --> 06:37.865
IT'S A SLOW SONG.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.001
OHH...

06:42.002 --> 06:43.671
MMM...

06:49.242 --> 06:50.711
JIMMY?
OH!

06:50.744 --> 06:52.112
HEY. UM...

06:54.515 --> 06:57.117
I'M JUST DOING JUJITSU.

06:57.150 --> 06:58.752
HUHH...YAHH!

07:01.054 --> 07:01.989
I'LL SEE YA.

07:04.792 --> 07:06.727
I'M NOT BEING
PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.729
I DRIVE A TINY
ELECTRIC CAR.

07:08.762 --> 07:11.031
YOU LIVE AT THE TOP
OF A HILL.

07:11.832 --> 07:13.901
I'LL BE THERE!

07:14.968 --> 07:16.203
BYE.

07:17.104 --> 07:18.506
WHO WAS THAT?

07:18.539 --> 07:19.239
FAYE.

07:19.272 --> 07:21.041
AH. YOU'RE STILL
SEEIN' HER, HUH?

07:21.074 --> 07:22.075
HOW'S THAT GOIN'?

07:22.109 --> 07:22.876
IT'S GOIN' GREAT.

07:22.910 --> 07:26.179
THE BEST RELATIONSHIP
I'VE BEEN IN.

07:26.213 --> 07:27.080
THE BEST.

07:27.114 --> 07:31.184
LOOK AT THIS MOVIE.
TYPICAL MALE FANTASY.

07:31.218 --> 07:33.954
"WOMEN WILL DO
ANYTHING FOR MONEY."

07:33.987 --> 07:35.789
HERE'S A DOLLAR.
WILL YOU SHUT UP?

07:35.823 --> 07:39.159
YOU KNOW WHAT? NEXT TIME
YOU ASK ME TO A MOVIE,
LET ME PICK IT.

07:39.192 --> 07:42.796
NEXT TIME I INVITE YOU
TO A MOVIE, KILL ME!

07:43.130 --> 07:43.931
ARE YOU THREATENING ME?

07:43.964 --> 07:47.034
IF I WAS THREATENING YOU,
I'D DO THIS.

07:47.067 --> 07:48.168
JERK!

07:48.201 --> 07:49.102
Man: SHHH!

07:49.136 --> 07:50.971
DON'T SHUSH MY WOMAN!

07:51.004 --> 07:53.106
I AM NOT YOUR WOMAN!

07:55.242 --> 07:56.710
CONGRATULATIONS,
MY BROTHER.

07:56.744 --> 07:58.612
YOU FOUND YOURSELF
ANOTHER PSYCHO.

07:58.646 --> 08:02.115
NO. THIS IS A VERY--
THIS IS VERY HEALTHY.

08:02.149 --> 08:03.984
SO THE SEX IS GREAT?

08:04.017 --> 08:05.052
NOT HAVING ANY SEX.

08:05.085 --> 08:07.655
WE'RE GETTING
WAY HIGHER THAN THAT.

08:07.688 --> 08:09.657
OH. DRUGS.
NO.

08:09.690 --> 08:11.525
COMMUNICATION.

08:11.559 --> 08:12.860
WE'RE COMMUNICATING...

08:12.893 --> 08:14.294
ON AN INCREDIBLE
LEVEL.

08:14.327 --> 08:16.730
WE CAN SAY ANYTHING
TO EACH OTHER.

08:16.764 --> 08:18.566
NO BOUNDARIES.

08:18.599 --> 08:20.067
I'VE NEVER BEEN
THIS HAPPY WITH A WOMAN.

08:24.304 --> 08:26.006
YEAH.

08:26.039 --> 08:29.843
I SAID I'LL
FREAKIN' BE THERE!

08:30.210 --> 08:31.612
THIS IS NICE...

08:31.645 --> 08:34.014
US DOING HOMEWORK
TOGETHER AGAIN.

08:34.047 --> 08:36.116
YEAH. I KINDA
MISSED IT.

08:36.149 --> 08:38.085
ARE WE ALMOST DONE?

08:38.118 --> 08:41.855
'CAUSE I NEED THE PEN
TO CIRCLE A HAIRCUT I LIKE.

08:44.091 --> 08:45.058
HERE YOU GO.

08:45.092 --> 08:46.860
OH. THANKS.

08:47.094 --> 08:51.164
UM...I SHOULD--
I SHOULD PROBABLY
GET GOING.

08:51.198 --> 08:52.633
OH! OH, OK.

08:52.666 --> 08:55.636
WELL...UM...

08:57.204 --> 08:59.206

08:59.239 --> 09:01.541
OK...PAL.

09:11.885 --> 09:15.122
LILY, WE--
WE CAN'T DO THIS.
WE'RE--WE'RE...

09:15.155 --> 09:16.156
WE'RE BROKEN UP.

09:16.189 --> 09:19.226
YES. YES, AND WE DO NOT
WANT TO GET BACK TOGETHER.

09:19.259 --> 09:21.128
OF--OF COURSE NOT!
I MEAN, HOW COULD WE?

09:21.161 --> 09:23.797
WE...WE CHEATED
ON EACH OTHER.

09:23.831 --> 09:25.733
YEAH, WE DID.

09:26.233 --> 09:28.869
THAT'S
TOO BAD, 'CAUSE...

09:28.902 --> 09:31.171
THAT KISSING
KINDA FELT GOOD.

09:31.204 --> 09:32.606
I KNOW.

09:32.640 --> 09:34.174
BUT WE'RE
JUST FRIENDS.

09:34.207 --> 09:35.142
JUST...
YES.

09:35.175 --> 09:36.243
FRIENDS.

09:36.276 --> 09:37.778
UNLESS WE...

09:37.811 --> 09:38.345
WHAT?

09:38.378 --> 09:39.379
WELL, WE--WE COULD,

09:39.412 --> 09:40.714
UM...I DON'T KNOW,

09:40.748 --> 09:44.785
MAYBE BE, LIKE, FRIENDS
WITH...BENEFITS?

09:44.818 --> 09:45.819
RIGHT! YEAH.
WE--WE--WE--

09:45.853 --> 09:47.320
SO WE--WE COULD
STILL FOOL AROUND,

09:47.354 --> 09:49.289
BUT WITHOUT
THE STRINGS ATTACHED.

09:49.322 --> 09:51.024
YEAH, BECAUSE WE'RE
STILL BROKEN UP,

09:51.058 --> 09:54.194
BUT THIS WAY, NO EMOTIONS,
NO COMMITMENT.

09:54.227 --> 09:55.395
JUST...BENEFITS.

09:55.428 --> 09:57.164
SOUNDS REASONABLE.
I AGREE.

09:57.197 --> 09:58.231
OHHH...
MMM! MMM!

09:58.265 --> 09:59.800
HEY, LILY,
DO YOU HAVE A--

09:59.833 --> 10:02.169
MOM, I'M
WITH A FRIEND!

10:02.202 --> 10:03.303
OH...
MOM!

10:03.336 --> 10:05.105
HANGIN' OUT.

10:07.174 --> 10:08.175
OH, GOD. ONE STRIPE.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

10:08.208 --> 10:09.977
HEY, DID YOU KNOW
LILY...

10:10.010 --> 10:11.378
BRAD, OR...
WHAT IS THAT?

10:11.411 --> 10:13.046
HUH?
WHAT IS THAT?

10:13.080 --> 10:15.048
BRAD AND LILY WHAT?
DON'T LEAVE ME HANGIN'.

10:15.082 --> 10:16.884
IS THAT
A PREGNANCY TEST?

10:16.917 --> 10:18.786
WHAT?

10:19.052 --> 10:20.888
THIS? NO!

10:20.921 --> 10:23.857
THIS...THIS
IS A THERMOMETER.

10:23.891 --> 10:27.627
UH-HUH. WHY DON'T YOU
PUT IT IN YOUR MOUTH?

10:29.897 --> 10:34.167
OK, FINE! ALL RIGHT?!
I'M TAKIN'
A PREGNANCY TEST.

10:34.201 --> 10:36.069
WHY

10:36.103 --> 10:38.706
NO! I'M NOT STUPID. OK?

10:38.739 --> 10:39.740
I'M NOT PREGNANT.

10:39.773 --> 10:43.243
ALL RIGHT?
I'M JUST CHECKIN'
MY ESTROGEN LEVELS.

10:43.977 --> 10:45.412
BABY...

10:45.445 --> 10:48.281
I MIGHT HAVE
COUVADE SYNDROME.

10:48.315 --> 10:49.182
WHAT?

10:49.216 --> 10:50.818
SYMPATHETIC PREGNANCY.

10:50.851 --> 10:52.085
OK? I LOOKED IT UP
ON THE INTERNET.

10:52.119 --> 10:54.154
I'VE GOT
ALL THE SYMPTOMS.
I HAVE...

10:54.187 --> 10:56.156
CRAMPING...NAUSEA...

10:56.189 --> 10:57.324
IRRITABILITY.

10:57.357 --> 11:00.093
WOW. THIS IS, UH...

11:00.127 --> 11:01.094
WOW!

11:01.128 --> 11:01.995
OK!

11:02.029 --> 11:04.865
OK, LAUGH.
IT IS NOT FUNNY!
OK? I AM SICK!

11:04.898 --> 11:06.199
I'M SORRY.

11:06.233 --> 11:08.001
IT'S JUST--IT'S
NICE TO SEE YOU

11:08.035 --> 11:11.104
FINALLY SYMPATHETIC
TO ONE OF MY PREGNANCIES.

11:11.138 --> 11:12.272
FIRST DOWN!
LET'S GO!

11:12.305 --> 11:15.175
OH, GOD! LILY,
STOP HITTING YOUR BROTHER!

11:15.208 --> 11:16.877
BE QUIET!
SHUT UP!

11:16.910 --> 11:18.145
JIMMY, STOP
SCREAMING!

11:18.178 --> 11:20.247
[BOTH KIDS SCREAMING,
INDISTINCT]

11:20.280 --> 11:24.217
OH, GOD! STOP! I THINK
MY WATER JUST BROKE!

11:24.251 --> 11:26.053
OK, I'LL FIX IT
IN A MINUTE, BABE!

11:27.487 --> 11:30.223
YEAH, HOW ABOUT
A LITTLE SYMPATHY
FOR HUH?

11:30.257 --> 11:31.291
MY NIPPLES ARE SORE.

11:35.796 --> 11:37.330
SORE NIPPLES!
IT'S RIGHT HERE!

11:37.364 --> 11:39.900
HEY! WHAT
IS GOING

11:39.933 --> 11:41.301
ON?!

11:41.334 --> 11:43.170
UM...WE--
WE WERE JUST HAVING

11:43.203 --> 11:46.206
A DISCUSSION ABOUT
SOME...SOMETHING.

11:46.239 --> 11:47.307
YEAH, I HEARD.

11:47.340 --> 11:50.243
WHY DON'T WE FINISH
OUR--OUR CONVERSATION
UPSTAIRS.

11:50.277 --> 11:51.244
RIGHT. RIGHT, RIGHT.

11:51.278 --> 11:52.279
GOOD, BECAUSE I--I--

11:52.312 --> 11:55.949
I REALLY HAD
AN IMPORTANT POINT
I NEEDED TO MAKE.

11:55.983 --> 11:57.250
BRAD,
SHE GETS IT.

12:01.488 --> 12:03.791
SO, I SEE YOU'RE
A COUPLE AGAIN.

12:03.824 --> 12:06.393
NO. MOM, HOW MANY TIMES
DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU?

12:06.426 --> 12:07.761
BRAD AND I
ARE JUST FRIENDS.

12:07.795 --> 12:11.064
REALLY. 'CAUSE...
I DON'T GIVE MY FRIENDS
THAT MANY DOORBELL RIDES.

12:11.098 --> 12:14.401
COME ON. IT'S
PRETTY OBVIOUS YOU STILL
WANT TO BE WITH HIM.

12:14.434 --> 12:18.438
WELL, EVEN IF I DID,
I--I'M NOT GONNA JUST
GO BACK TO HIM

12:18.471 --> 12:19.306
AFTER WHAT
HE DID TO ME.

12:19.339 --> 12:23.343
IF ANYTHING, HE
SHOULD BE THE CRAWLER.

12:23.376 --> 12:25.212
WELL, IF BRAD WANTS
TO TELL ME HOW HE FEELS,

12:25.245 --> 12:27.080
THEN GOODY.
BUT UNTIL THEN,

12:27.114 --> 12:29.449
WE HAVE A SYSTEM
THAT WORKS.

12:29.482 --> 12:31.384
WE'RE JUST FRIENDS
WITH BENEFITS.

12:31.418 --> 12:34.221
THAT WAY,
WE DON'T HAVE
ANY EMOTIONAL TIES,

12:34.254 --> 12:35.422
AND NO ONE GETS HURT.
OK,

12:35.455 --> 12:37.257
HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE?
IT'S YOU AND BRAD.

12:37.290 --> 12:39.292
YOU CAN'T HAVE
NO EMOTIONAL TIES.

12:39.326 --> 12:40.994
OUR RELATIONSHIP
HAS EVOLVED.

12:41.028 --> 12:45.498
IT'S...BEYOND EMOTIONAL.
NOW IT'S PURELY
PHYSICAL.

12:46.299 --> 12:50.904
WELL. WHAT EVERY MOTHER
WANTS TO HEAR.

12:51.604 --> 12:54.141
HEY, I--JIMMY, WHAT--
WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

12:54.174 --> 12:56.143
JUST GETTING READY
FOR THE SPORTING SEASON.

12:56.176 --> 12:58.178
UH-HUH. YOU HATE SPORTS.

12:58.211 --> 12:59.813
YOU CRAZED?
I'M REALLY INTO SPORTS.

12:59.847 --> 13:02.449
YOU FELL ASLEEP
AT THAT YANKEES GAME
LAST YEAR.

13:02.482 --> 13:04.284
WELL, BASEBALL'S
A LITTLE BORING.

13:04.317 --> 13:06.186
IT WAS GAME 6
OF THE WORLD SERIES.

13:06.219 --> 13:07.254
ALL RIGHT!

13:07.287 --> 13:08.922
UM...

13:08.956 --> 13:11.391
THAT HOT GIRL
WHO MOVED IN
NEXT-DOOR

13:11.424 --> 13:13.026
IS...IS
REALLY INTO SPORTS,

13:13.060 --> 13:15.162
AND HER ROOM'S
ACROSS FROM MINE,
SO...

13:15.195 --> 13:18.598
OH, YOU WANT HER
TO SEE YOU TOSSIN'
THE PIGSKIN.

13:18.631 --> 13:20.100
GOD, NO!

13:20.133 --> 13:22.235
THROWIN' A FOOTBALL.

13:22.269 --> 13:24.437
OH. YEAH.

13:25.172 --> 13:26.073
THEY CALL IT
PARALLEL PARKING

13:26.106 --> 13:28.041
BECAUSE THE CAR'S
PARALLEL TO THE CURB.

13:28.075 --> 13:30.377
IT'S NOT 2-TIRES-
UP-ON-THE-SIDEWALK
PARKING.

13:30.410 --> 13:32.545
IT'S 'CAUSE I WAS
IN THE CAR WITH YOU.

13:32.579 --> 13:35.215
I WANTED TO GET
THE HELL OUT OF IT.

13:35.248 --> 13:36.316
HEY. SEAN.

13:36.349 --> 13:39.352
EDDIE. HEY, LOOK
WHO IT IS, BABY.
IT'S EDDIE AND FAYE.

13:39.386 --> 13:40.220
YEAH. HEY, GUYS.

13:40.253 --> 13:40.921
HEY.
WE BROUGHT DELI.

13:40.954 --> 13:42.522
YEAH. WE GOT
SOME CORNED BEEF,

13:42.555 --> 13:44.491
SOME PASTRAMI, UH...

13:44.524 --> 13:47.194
COUPLE EXTRA PICKLES
IN CASE OF CRAVIN'.

13:47.227 --> 13:48.161
HA HA HA HA HA!

13:48.195 --> 13:50.597
FOR THE PREGNANT
GUY. THAT'S--
THAT'S FUNNY.

13:50.630 --> 13:52.499
YOU KNOW, I'VE
NEVER ACTUALLY KNOWN

13:52.532 --> 13:53.633
A PREGNANT WOMAN
WHO CRAVED PICKLES.

13:53.666 --> 13:55.568
WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE
THE WHOLE THING
WAS MADE UP BY MEN

13:55.602 --> 13:58.205
WHO BELIEVE THAT WOMEN
ARE CONSTANTLY HUNGERING
FOR THE PHALLUS.

13:58.238 --> 13:59.639
WILL YOU STOP USIN'
THE WORD "PHALLUS"?

13:59.672 --> 14:02.242
THE ANCIENT GREEKS
DIDN'T USE THAT WORD
AS MUCH AS YOU DO.

14:02.275 --> 14:05.112
WELL, WHAT'S WITH
THE ANCIENT GREEK
REFERENCE, ED?

14:05.145 --> 14:06.079
YOU TRYIN' TO TELL
US SOMETHIN'?

14:06.113 --> 14:08.548
OH, YOU IMPLYING SOMETHIN'
ABOUT MY SEXUALITY?

14:08.581 --> 14:10.217
WELL, IF
THE PHALLUS FITS...

14:10.250 --> 14:11.451
DO YOU HAVE TO
COMMENT ON EVERYTHING?

14:11.484 --> 14:14.021
I MEAN, YOU'RE LIKE
A SHARK. IF YOU STOP
TALKING, YOU'LL DIE.

14:14.054 --> 14:16.523
HEY, HO, HO, HO!
COME ON, GUYS,
LET'S, UH...

14:16.556 --> 14:17.925
HEY, WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE EAT?

14:17.958 --> 14:19.426
YOU WANT THESE PICKLES,
DON'T YOU?

14:19.459 --> 14:20.961
AND WHAT IF I DO?

14:20.994 --> 14:22.229
UH-HUH...

14:22.262 --> 14:23.496
WOW!

14:24.064 --> 14:26.166
YOU ARE A REALLY
GOOD FRIEND!

14:26.199 --> 14:30.037
YOU'RE NOT
SUCH A BAD FRIEND YOURSELF.

14:30.637 --> 14:33.206
HMM.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.142
HELLO.

14:35.175 --> 14:36.543
OH, HEY, JASON.

14:36.576 --> 14:39.646
UH...CAN YOU
HANG ON A SEC?

14:40.213 --> 14:40.948
IS THIS WEIRD...

14:40.981 --> 14:43.683
ME TAKING A CALL
FROM ANOTHER GUY?

14:43.716 --> 14:45.152
I...DON'T KNOW. I MEAN,

14:45.185 --> 14:49.656
FRIENDS DON'T STOP FRIENDS
FROM TAKING PHONE CALLS
IN FRONT OF EACH OTHER.

14:51.124 --> 14:52.359
HEY.

14:53.160 --> 14:54.394
REALLY!

14:54.427 --> 14:56.429
UH, LET ME CHECK.

14:56.463 --> 14:59.266
JASON BAXTER HAS TICKETS
TO THE WHITE STRIPES.

14:59.299 --> 15:00.433
COOL! HOW MANY?

15:00.467 --> 15:03.303
I'M JUST THINKIN' TWO.

15:03.336 --> 15:04.004
OH.

15:04.037 --> 15:07.207
BUT...DO YOU NOT
WANT ME TO GO?

15:07.240 --> 15:08.675
I DON'T KNOW.
DO YOU WANT TO GO?

15:08.708 --> 15:11.979
I'M JUST SAYING THAT
IF YOU DON'T WANT ME TO GO,
YOU SHOULD SAY SOMETHING.

15:12.012 --> 15:14.614
WELL, IF YOU DON'T
WANT TO GO, YOU
SHOULD SAY SOMETHING.

15:14.647 --> 15:17.985
WELL, IF YOU'RE NOT
SAYING THAT YOU DON'T
WANT ME TO GO,

15:18.018 --> 15:18.986
THEN MAYBE I'LL GO.

15:19.019 --> 15:20.420
WELL, IF YOU'RE SAYING
YOU DON'T NOT WANT TO GO,

15:20.453 --> 15:21.955
THEN YOU SHOULD GO.

15:21.989 --> 15:23.456
THEN MAYBE I'LL GO!

15:23.490 --> 15:24.391
OK!

15:24.424 --> 15:26.393
O...OK.

15:27.227 --> 15:28.061
UM...HEY.

15:28.095 --> 15:32.532
NO. A FRIEND WAS JUST
HELPING ME DECIDE.

15:32.565 --> 15:34.667
I--I'D LOVE TO.

15:34.701 --> 15:37.370
GREAT! I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

15:37.404 --> 15:39.039
BYE.

15:39.372 --> 15:41.408
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE GOING!

15:41.441 --> 15:43.476
WELL, YOU SHOULD'A
TOLD ME NOT TO!

15:43.510 --> 15:44.344
WELL, I SHOULDN'T
HAVE HAD TO!

15:44.377 --> 15:45.612
YOU SHOULD'VE NOT
WANTED TO ON YOUR OWN!

15:45.645 --> 15:49.316
YOU SHOULD'VE GIVEN ME
A REASON TO NOT WANT TO,
BUT YOU DIDN'T!

15:49.349 --> 15:51.351
WELL, I DIDN'T KNOW
I WAS SUPPOSED TO!

15:51.384 --> 15:53.353
OH, GREAT! BECAUSE
YOU DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO,

15:53.386 --> 15:57.357
I HAVE TO GO TO THE STUPID
WHITE STRIPES AND SIT
IN THE STUPID FRONT ROW!

15:57.390 --> 15:58.625
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DON'T CARE
WHERE YOU GO

15:58.658 --> 16:01.461
AND WHO YOU GO WITH,
BECAUSE I'M JUST
YOUR FRIEND!

16:01.494 --> 16:03.330
WELL, THEN I'M GONNA GO,

16:03.363 --> 16:06.033
AND I'M GONNA HAVE
A GREAT TIME!

16:06.066 --> 16:08.468
I HOPE YOU DO!
SEE YOU LATER, BUDDY!

16:08.501 --> 16:09.469
SO LONG, PAL!

16:09.502 --> 16:12.505
DON'T LET THE DOOR HIT YOU
ON THE WAY OUT, AMIGO!

16:12.539 --> 16:16.376
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO'S LEAVING, MATEY!

16:16.809 --> 16:18.411
YOU'RE LUCKY
YOU FEEL SO GREAT.

16:18.445 --> 16:19.312
WHEN I WAS PREGNANT
WITH MICHAEL,

16:19.346 --> 16:22.149
I HAD NAUSEA, BACK PAIN,
THE WHOLE 9 YARDS.

16:22.182 --> 16:25.152
WHAT'S THE HARDEST PART
OF IT FOR YOU, SEAN?

16:25.185 --> 16:26.486
WISE-ASS REMARKS.

16:26.519 --> 16:27.520
SEAN HAS A TOUCH

16:27.554 --> 16:29.522
OF COUVADE SYNDROME.

16:29.556 --> 16:30.390
SYMPATHETIC
PREGNANCY.

16:30.423 --> 16:33.126
YOU KNOW, I THINK
SYMPATHETIC PREGNANCY

16:33.160 --> 16:34.727
IS JUST ANOTHER WAY
FOR MEN TO TAKE AWAY

16:34.761 --> 16:37.564
THE ONE SINGULAR
FEMININE EXPERIENCE.

16:37.597 --> 16:39.132
OH, PLEASE.
ARE YOU CRAZY?

16:39.166 --> 16:41.334
WHAT MAN WOULD WANT
TO GO THROUGH THAT?

16:41.368 --> 16:42.169
LOOK AT SEAN.

16:42.202 --> 16:43.370
OK? HE FEELS
HORRIBLE.

16:43.403 --> 16:45.805
HE LOOKS
LIKE GARBAGE.
HEY!

16:45.838 --> 16:47.740
EAT YOUR PICKLE.

16:48.308 --> 16:49.776
YES, EDDIE, THAT'S WHAT
PREGNANCY'S ALL ABOUT.

16:49.809 --> 16:52.579
MAYBE IF YOU WERE
MORE IN TOUCH WITH
YOUR FEMININE SIDE,

16:52.612 --> 16:54.447
YOU'D DO BETTER
IN RELATIONSHIPS.

16:54.481 --> 16:55.682
AND MAYBE IF YOU WERE
A BETTER MOTHER,

16:55.715 --> 16:59.452
YOU WOULD HAVE CUSTODY
OF YOUR SON NOW.
HUH

17:04.524 --> 17:07.427
HEY, SEAN, PASS
THE COLE SLAW.

17:08.128 --> 17:10.330
EDDIE, WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU THINKING?

17:10.363 --> 17:14.334
I JUST WANT SOME COLE SLAW.
SEAN'S CLOSEST TO IT.

17:14.634 --> 17:18.171
ED, YOU NEVER TELL A WOMAN
SHE'S A BAD MOM.

17:18.205 --> 17:20.407
FIRST OF ALL,
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
OUR DYNAMIC. OK?

17:20.440 --> 17:22.075
WE ARE OPEN AND HONEST
WITH EACH OTHER.

17:22.109 --> 17:26.279
AND BESIDES,
SHE A BAD MOTHER.
THE JUDGE SAID SO.

17:27.214 --> 17:29.516
EDDIE, I THINK
YOU CROSSED THE LINE.

17:29.549 --> 17:30.450
YOU BETTER
GO TALK TO HER.

17:30.483 --> 17:31.551
NO. YOU DON'T GET IT.
YOU GUYS DON'T GET IT.

17:31.584 --> 17:35.455
YOU'RE ALL ABOUT
PUTTIN' UP WALLS.
WE TEAR 'EM DOWN.

17:36.289 --> 17:39.526
WHERE YOU GOIN'?
WE'RE NOT FINISHED
EATING YET.

17:39.559 --> 17:41.161
GO TO HELL, EDDIE.

17:41.194 --> 17:43.430
WHAT? WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

17:43.463 --> 17:44.764
YOU HURT MY FEELINGS!

17:44.797 --> 17:47.567
I THINK THEY NEED
TO PUT UP SOME WALLS.

17:48.368 --> 17:49.302
PSST.
BUT--

17:49.336 --> 17:51.138
JUST BRING
YOUR SANDWICH.

17:51.804 --> 17:52.672
WHAT? I DON'T
UNDERSTAND.

17:52.705 --> 17:53.673
I THOUGHT,
YOU KNOW, THAT
WAS OUR DYNAMIC.

17:53.706 --> 17:56.543
UH, YOU KNOW,
WE FIGHT, WE...
GET THINGS OUT.

17:56.576 --> 17:58.311
YOU KNOW. AND
THEN--THEN...

17:58.345 --> 17:59.146
YOU KNOW,
SPEAK OUR MINDS.

17:59.179 --> 18:00.647
YEAH, BUT YOU CAN'T
JUST SAY ANYTHING.

18:00.680 --> 18:03.616
AND THERE'S A FINE LINE
BETWEEN EXPRESSING YOURSELF

18:03.650 --> 18:04.784
AND THEN JUST BEING CRUEL.

18:04.817 --> 18:06.153
HEY, THAT SOUNDS
LIKE WORK.

18:06.186 --> 18:08.221
OF COURSE IT IS.
IT'S SO MALE

18:08.255 --> 18:11.358
TO AVOID ANY RELATIONSHIP
THAT HAS ANYTHING
TO DO WITH WORK.

18:11.391 --> 18:12.459
I'LL DO THE WORK!

18:12.492 --> 18:15.362
WHAT DO YOU--
WHAT ELSE--WHAT
DO YOU WANT FROM ME?!

18:15.395 --> 18:19.332
OH, POOR BABY. ARE
YOU FEELING FRUSTRATED?

18:19.366 --> 18:21.234
YES, I'M FEELING
FRUSTRATED! YOU KNOW,

18:21.268 --> 18:23.536
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW FRUSTRATING THIS IS.

18:23.570 --> 18:26.339
OH, YEAH? WELL,
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

18:29.742 --> 18:32.379
WELL, THAT'S
ANOTHER WAY TO GO.

18:37.550 --> 18:38.551
YOU ABOUT DONE
WITH THAT SANDWICH?

18:38.585 --> 18:42.555
I'M GETTING ONE
OF MY PREGNANCY
CRAVINGS AGAIN.

18:42.589 --> 18:44.391
BABY, YOU GOT
YOUR OWN SANDWICH.

18:44.424 --> 18:46.893
NOT T KIND.

18:46.926 --> 18:49.462
OH. OH. UM...

18:49.496 --> 18:50.463
WHAT'S WRONG?

18:50.497 --> 18:51.898
BABY, I JUST--

18:52.532 --> 18:54.767
I DON'T FEEL SEXY.

18:55.302 --> 18:57.337
WHAT IS GOING ON?

18:57.370 --> 18:58.271
COME ON,
YOU FELT SEXY

18:58.305 --> 18:59.406
RIGHT AFTER YOU CUT
JIMMY'S UMBILICAL CORD.

18:59.439 --> 19:02.309
I KNOW, BUT HOW
CAN YOU BE SO CHIPPER
AND SEX

19:02.342 --> 19:04.244
I MEAN, WE GOT
A BABY COMIN', BABE.

19:04.277 --> 19:05.512
I DON'T KNOW!
I FEEL GREAT!

19:05.545 --> 19:07.247
YEAH, BUT HOW
WE GONNA AFFORD IT?

19:07.280 --> 19:09.716
HONEY, I KNOW
WE DIDN'T PLAN
ON HAVING ANOTHER BABY,

19:09.749 --> 19:12.652
BUT...WE DIDN'T PLAN
ON THE OTHER ONES,
YOU KNOW,

19:12.685 --> 19:14.354
AND THEY TURNED OUT...

19:14.387 --> 19:17.424
WELL, THEY'RE
NOT IN JAIL.

19:17.457 --> 19:18.625
I KNOW, BUT
THEY'RE GROWING UP,

19:18.658 --> 19:19.592
AND, I MEAN, WE HAVE
ANOTHER BABY

19:19.626 --> 19:21.861
AND IT'S EXPENSIVE,
AND THEN
WE HAVE TO WORRY

19:21.894 --> 19:23.830
FOR 18 YEARS
IF THEY'RE PLAYING
BY THE STREET

19:23.863 --> 19:26.499
OR RUNNING IN TRAFFIC
OF IF THEY'RE FAIL--

19:26.533 --> 19:27.500
I--JUST SO MUCH.

19:27.534 --> 19:30.203
I MEAN,
DO YOU THINK WE CAN
GET THROUGH THIS?

19:30.237 --> 19:32.705
WE WILL. YOU KNOW?
WE'LL...

19:32.739 --> 19:35.642
WE'LL FIND--
FIND A WAY.

19:35.942 --> 19:36.976
YOU SURE?

19:37.009 --> 19:38.445
YEAH.

19:38.478 --> 19:40.247
