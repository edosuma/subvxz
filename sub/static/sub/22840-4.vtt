there must be something,

birth.

Never have I ever...

00:45.084 --> 00:48.934
brought food into sexy time.

00:49.011 --> 00:50.541
Is whip cream food?

Yeah.

Hello.

01:13.984 --> 01:15.604
I'm Alison Rich, and today...

01:15.672 --> 01:17.299
we'll be talking about the birth...

01:17.512 --> 01:18.916
of birth control.

01:18.984 --> 01:20.877
Cheers!

01:21.700 --> 01:23.869
<i>So, Margaret Sanger was a woman,</i>

01:23.937 --> 01:26.316
<i>who at 19, her mother died</i>

01:26.384 --> 01:28.643
<i>from complications from pregnancies.</i>

01:28.742 --> 01:30.057
<i>She'd been pregnant</i>

01:30.125 --> 01:31.143
eight...

01:31.211 --> 01:32.338
teen...

01:32.406 --> 01:33.431
times.

01:33.499 --> 01:34.546
No.

01:34.614 --> 01:36.917
Yes. I've been pregnant zero times,

01:36.985 --> 01:39.008
and I'm stressed out just thinking...

01:39.076 --> 01:40.297
about her.

01:40.365 --> 01:42.302
<i>So, Margaret moved to New York,</i>

01:42.370 --> 01:43.617
<i>and was like I'm gonna be a nurse</i>

01:43.685 --> 01:44.777
<i>for low-income women in...</i>

01:44.845 --> 01:46.227
<i>♪ New York City ♪</i>

01:46.295 --> 01:48.641
<i>And one of the patients she observed</i>

01:48.727 --> 01:50.102
<i>was this woman Sadie Sachs.</i>

01:50.170 --> 01:52.602
<i>Sadie Sachs was a woman
who had had three children,</i>

01:52.741 --> 01:54.688
<i>and her doctor was like,</i>

01:54.748 --> 01:56.717
<i>if you have another kid,
you're gonna...</i>

01:56.748 --> 01:58.352
<i>you know... die.</i>

01:58.504 --> 02:01.727
<i>And, like, your husband
should sleep on the roof.</i>

02:01.815 --> 02:05.164
<i>And she's like, okay, cool.</i>

02:05.456 --> 02:07.348
So...

02:07.440 --> 02:08.640
What's so funny?

02:08.709 --> 02:10.133
It's really hard...

02:10.508 --> 02:12.219
but I'm committed.

02:13.192 --> 02:15.938
So, a couple of months later
someone comes up to Margaret,

02:16.006 --> 02:18.031
<i>and they're like, hey,
here's the update,</i>

02:18.099 --> 02:20.227
<i>she died from a self-induced abortion.</i>

02:20.323 --> 02:23.115
<i>And Margaret's like, what... the...</i>

02:23.183 --> 02:24.297
<i>fu..?</i>

02:24.365 --> 02:25.399
<i>This is horrible.</i>

02:25.467 --> 02:26.603
<i>There has to be a better way.</i>

02:26.654 --> 02:28.487
<i>There must be...
something like a pill</i>

02:28.555 --> 02:30.792
<i>that you can take
that's as easy as an Aspirin,</i>

02:30.860 --> 02:33.157
<i>you know, that your doctor
can prescribe to you</i>

02:33.225 --> 02:34.696
<i>that could control...</i>

02:34.764 --> 02:35.985
<i>birth.</i>

02:36.053 --> 02:37.648
<i>So, Margaret was like, you know what.</i>

02:37.716 --> 02:40.102
<i>It's helpful to be a nurse,
but it's not helpful enough.</i>

02:40.170 --> 02:41.208
<i>So,</i>

02:41.276 --> 02:44.219
<i>in 1916, Margaret Sanger
and her sister, Ethel Byrne,</i>

02:44.287 --> 02:47.359
founded the Brownsville
clinic in Brooklyn,

02:47.475 --> 02:48.938
New York!

02:49.167 --> 02:50.625
And, um...

02:50.693 --> 02:53.227
<i>in the first ten days,
450 ladies showed up.</i>

02:53.413 --> 02:55.546
<i>Margaret's like, hey,
here's pamphlets</i>

02:55.614 --> 02:57.070
<i>on what every woman should know...</i>

02:58.700 --> 03:00.234
<i>God, I love to burp.</i>

03:00.626 --> 03:02.528
I've been drinking vodka...

03:02.629 --> 03:05.659
and cranberry juice like
a real college freshman.

03:07.113 --> 03:08.851
<i>So, it's only a matter of time</i>

03:08.919 --> 03:12.093
<i>before the New York Police
Department's vice squad</i>

03:12.163 --> 03:15.256
<i>shows up and goes, dun-dun-dunn.</i>

03:15.332 --> 03:16.883
<i>We're shutting this down!</i>

03:16.979 --> 03:19.158
<i>Ladies are getting
information about their...</i>

03:19.226 --> 03:21.320
<i>how their own bodies work.</i>

03:21.388 --> 03:23.065
<i>We don't like it.</i>

03:23.133 --> 03:24.582
<i>And Margaret's like,
it doesn't even matter.</i>

03:24.649 --> 03:27.820
<i>My message of birth control
is already out there.</i>

03:27.888 --> 03:29.190
<i>She wasn't going to get stopped.</i>

03:29.258 --> 03:31.282
So, they end up getting arrested.

03:32.244 --> 03:34.849
Oh, I feel like I'm so useless.

03:34.941 --> 03:36.618
- You're not.
- Okay.

03:36.783 --> 03:39.705
<i>So she's giving a speech at
this women's suffrage event,</i>

03:39.773 --> 03:40.901
<i>and she's like,</i>

03:40.969 --> 03:43.479
<i>if we do not have
control over our bodies,</i>

03:43.547 --> 03:44.635
<i>then we have nothing.</i>

03:44.703 --> 03:46.260
<i>People think of sex as this, like,</i>

03:46.328 --> 03:48.619
<i>weird thing that we're not
supposed to talk about,</i>

03:48.687 --> 03:51.033
<i>but sex is as basic to
the human experience</i>

03:51.101 --> 03:52.971
<i>as eating and pooping,</i>

03:53.039 --> 03:55.533
<i>and those are two things
that I love so much.</i>

03:55.618 --> 03:57.611
<i>If I get an email from
you, half the time</i>

03:57.679 --> 03:59.041
I am on my toilet.

03:59.209 --> 04:02.104
I love to take my
laptop into the bathroom.

04:02.632 --> 04:05.026
So this rich lady, Katherine
McCormick was like...

04:05.094 --> 04:06.985
<i>Hey, Margaret Sanger.
What's up?</i>

04:07.091 --> 04:08.822
<i>I would like to...</i>

04:09.002 --> 04:11.908
<i>give you, not only my
time, but my dollar bills.</i>

04:11.976 --> 04:13.287
<i>So, she was like,</i>

04:13.355 --> 04:14.915
<i>I'm gonna drop the accent for a second,</i>

04:14.985 --> 04:16.517
<i>you know, 'cause it's exhausting.</i>

04:17.402 --> 04:19.426
So, she's like,
I want to help you

04:19.494 --> 04:20.767
<i>open up a new clinic.</i>

04:20.836 --> 04:22.327
<i>I'm gonna tell people
I'm going to Europe</i>

04:22.394 --> 04:25.291
<i>for fashion reasons,
but, really, it's for...</i>

04:25.663 --> 04:27.131
<i>birth control.</i>

04:27.524 --> 04:29.215
<i>So, she goes to Europe,</i>

04:29.283 --> 04:33.174
<i>and orchestrated this
insane fashion spy mission.</i>

04:33.260 --> 04:36.744
<i>So all of these diaphragms
get sewn into dresses.</i>

04:36.812 --> 04:38.370
<i>She comes back to the U.S.</i>

04:38.438 --> 04:40.713
<i>with a year's supply
worth of diaphragms.</i>

04:40.781 --> 04:41.815
<i>And they're like,</i>

04:41.883 --> 04:44.205
<i>whoo. We're reopening
our birth control clinic.</i>

04:44.273 --> 04:46.619
<i>We're calling it the "American
Birth Control League."</i>

04:46.696 --> 04:49.330
<i>Which, by 1942, was
called Planned Parenthood.</i>

04:49.398 --> 04:50.463
That's huge.

04:50.531 --> 04:51.843
It's huge!

04:52.027 --> 04:54.088
<i>And Margaret's like,
what a victory!</i>

04:54.156 --> 04:56.324
<i>But at the same time,
this isn't good enough.</i>

04:56.392 --> 04:58.860
So, for decades,
Margaret had this vision

04:58.928 --> 05:00.369
of some kind of pill...

05:00.442 --> 05:03.604
<i>And finally, she seeks
out Gregory Pincus,</i>

05:03.672 --> 05:05.049
<i>who was kicked out of Harvard</i>

05:05.117 --> 05:07.541
<i>for doing in vitro
fertilization on rabbits,</i>

05:07.609 --> 05:09.143
<i>and he's like, bloop, bloop, bloop,</i>

05:09.259 --> 05:10.557
<i>I'm in my basement.</i>

05:10.625 --> 05:13.517
<i>And Margaret's like,
I need to help you.</i>

05:13.585 --> 05:15.303
<i>No. You need to help me.</i>

05:15.371 --> 05:16.951
<i>Do the opposite of what you're doing</i>

05:17.019 --> 05:19.893
<i>but for human women
and not animal rabbits.</i>

05:21.691 --> 05:24.227
<i>And she's like, she's
going to give us 40 grand</i>

05:24.304 --> 05:25.736
<i>for you to figure this out.</i>

05:25.804 --> 05:29.174
<i>And Greg Pincus is like,
you had me at $40,000.</i>

05:31.768 --> 05:33.705
It's a "Sound of Music" reference.

05:33.773 --> 05:35.757
"Baby... you had me at..."

05:35.825 --> 05:36.947
I don't know that.

05:37.015 --> 05:38.105
"Hello."

05:38.173 --> 05:40.393
That's a classic line
from "Sound of Music"

05:40.461 --> 05:41.741
where Maria...

05:41.901 --> 05:44.401
goes, "You had me at hello,"
as in...

05:44.469 --> 05:46.193
No. That's "Jerry Maguire."

05:46.292 --> 05:47.295
"Hello...

05:47.363 --> 05:50.049
Ada-adear-adama-Jerry Maguire."

05:50.162 --> 05:52.121
No. Jerry Maguire...

05:52.198 --> 05:53.813
is...

05:53.890 --> 05:55.659
"You complete me."

05:56.960 --> 05:58.510
<i>And, "You had me at hello."</i>

05:58.578 --> 05:59.604
She says both?

05:59.672 --> 06:00.682
Yeah.

06:00.750 --> 06:01.827
<i>Cool.</i>

06:01.931 --> 06:04.682
<i>Then, in 1952, Greg Pincus is like,</i>

06:04.750 --> 06:07.023
<i>doo-doo-doo, trying to invent this pill,</i>

06:07.153 --> 06:09.671
<i>when he comes across his
old Harvard colleague,</i>

06:09.739 --> 06:11.288
<i>John Rock.</i>

06:11.859 --> 06:13.525
<i>Greg Pincus is like,
I'm trying to make</i>

06:13.593 --> 06:15.499
<i>this pill happen.</i>

06:15.567 --> 06:17.874
<i>And John Rock was
like, here's a hot tip,</i>

06:18.031 --> 06:19.929
<i>use this little hormone called...</i>

06:20.038 --> 06:21.837
<i>"progesterone."</i>

06:22.008 --> 06:23.640
<i>It shuts down their ovulation</i>

06:23.722 --> 06:24.895
<i>meaning eggs aren't coming out.</i>

06:24.962 --> 06:27.374
<i>Greg Pincus is like, that's
what I'm talking about.</i>

06:27.480 --> 06:28.635
<i>Um.</i>

06:28.986 --> 06:31.068
<i>And in 1957, boom!</i>

06:31.145 --> 06:32.359
<i>They create the pill.</i>

06:32.427 --> 06:34.223
<i>So, in the first year, 500,000 women</i>

06:34.291 --> 06:35.278
<i>get the pill.</i>

06:35.346 --> 06:36.898
<i>It was hugely successful.</i>

06:37.023 --> 06:39.286
<i>Then by 1960, it was
officially on the market</i>

06:39.354 --> 06:41.585
<i>as a form of contraception.</i>

06:41.732 --> 06:43.304
The development of the birth control...

06:43.372 --> 06:47.429
pill is the single most
important development

06:47.497 --> 06:48.703
<i>in women's liberation.</i>

06:48.771 --> 06:50.109
<i>- Wow.
- Women were like,</i>

06:50.177 --> 06:51.804
<i>we can go to college.</i>

06:51.927 --> 06:54.175
<i>We can join the work force.</i>

06:54.260 --> 06:56.124
<i>We can experience
the sexual revolution.</i>

06:56.192 --> 06:58.107
<i>It's really important!</i>

06:58.295 --> 07:00.265
<i>I don't know. Women just...</i>

07:00.384 --> 07:02.548
You kind of have to think
that you're going to be some

07:02.616 --> 07:04.335
superhero who...

07:05.619 --> 07:07.578
accomplishes your
career aspirations

07:07.646 --> 07:09.253
without any bumps along the way

07:09.321 --> 07:10.747
and also pops out a couple of kids

07:10.815 --> 07:13.046
on the way.
Whereas, men can...

07:13.231 --> 07:14.846
you know, sort of...

07:14.914 --> 07:16.873
They have more time,

07:17.000 --> 07:18.479
and it feels...

07:18.654 --> 07:20.033
unfair.

07:20.446 --> 07:21.611
It's true.

07:21.696 --> 07:24.190
P.S. Margaret Sanger was a eugenicist,

07:24.258 --> 07:25.325
but...

07:25.393 --> 07:26.795
not everybody is perfect.

07:26.896 --> 07:28.408
Martin Luther King Jr...

07:28.557 --> 07:29.611
had affairs.

07:32.722 --> 07:35.322
So impressed you're doing straight vod.

07:35.399 --> 07:36.666
Straight vod!

07:36.734 --> 07:39.170
Do you remember your
first memory of when

07:39.307 --> 07:41.431
you learned about sex, like...

07:41.681 --> 07:43.204
It was a movie on TV,

07:43.272 --> 07:45.364
and all the guys got in the pool.

07:45.465 --> 07:46.725
They were skinny dipping,

07:46.793 --> 07:48.478
and then all the girls,
like as a prank,

07:48.546 --> 07:50.259
stole their bathing suits and ran away.

07:50.327 --> 07:52.919
And it was, like, all the
guys were like, "Oh, no."

07:53.199 --> 07:55.477
That gave me, like,
a four year boner.

07:55.863 --> 07:58.173
Did you ever get to
fulfill that fantasy?

07:58.241 --> 07:59.955
No, but, you know,
now that I live in LA,

08:00.023 --> 08:01.337
there's more pools than ever.

08:01.405 --> 08:03.181
It's going to happen.

08:03.368 --> 08:04.770
Hi, I'm Gabe Liedman,

08:04.838 --> 08:08.414
and today we're going to be
discussing Mr. and Mrs. Kinsey.

08:08.587 --> 08:09.815
The Kinseys!

08:09.907 --> 08:11.600
The Kinseys!

08:12.909 --> 08:14.534
Yes!

08:14.790 --> 08:16.686
This is sex!

08:17.589 --> 08:19.103
Yes!

08:19.704 --> 08:20.810
<i>So,</i>

08:20.887 --> 08:25.011
<i>Alfred Kinsey was a professor
at the University of Indiana.</i>

08:25.079 --> 08:27.790
He's really antisocial.

08:27.867 --> 08:29.868
He's really hard to chill with.

08:29.945 --> 08:34.001
<i>Until one day at a
zoology department picnic,</i>

08:34.142 --> 08:37.042
<i>he was looking for
someone to chat with,</i>

08:37.267 --> 08:40.150
<i>and he met Clara,</i>

08:40.312 --> 08:42.871
<i>who was a chemistry student.</i>

08:42.993 --> 08:44.873
<i>And they really hit it off.</i>

08:45.009 --> 08:46.920
<i>He's like, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,</i>

08:46.997 --> 08:50.306
<i>and they're like,
we should be partners.</i>

08:50.434 --> 08:52.728
<i>So they fell in love.</i>

08:52.987 --> 08:55.214
<i>They got married a year later.</i>

08:55.282 --> 08:56.743
<i>It's the wedding night.</i>

08:56.884 --> 08:58.151
<i>They're trying to fu...</i>

08:58.228 --> 09:00.181
<i>She was like, this...</i>

09:00.368 --> 09:02.902
<i>feels like nothing. Could you stop?</i>

09:03.263 --> 09:04.655
<i>Right now?</i>

09:04.845 --> 09:07.240
<i>And I'm kind of wasted.</i>

09:11.885 --> 09:14.066
<i>So finally they went to a doctor.</i>

09:14.134 --> 09:15.236
<i>He was like,</i>

09:15.322 --> 09:17.150
<i>there's a problem with Clara's...</i>

09:17.227 --> 09:18.298
<i>puss,</i>

09:18.572 --> 09:20.019
<i>which is an area of the body</i>

09:20.096 --> 09:21.955
<i>that I find very confusing.</i>

09:22.204 --> 09:23.938
I love you.

09:24.657 --> 09:26.368
I'm an expert.

09:29.204 --> 09:32.509
<i>She has something
called an adherent...</i>

09:32.665 --> 09:36.603
<i>clitoris, which is something
that if you Google it...</i>

09:36.758 --> 09:38.902
<i>no big deal, this is something</i>

09:38.970 --> 09:40.337
<i>that happens to a lot of women.</i>

09:40.431 --> 09:42.575
<i>So, Clara had an operation,</i>

09:42.759 --> 09:45.431
and it made her...

09:45.644 --> 09:48.838
<i>able to enjoy intercourse.</i>

09:48.915 --> 09:50.443
<i>And they were experimenting,</i>

09:50.511 --> 09:53.052
<i>and they were doing all
sorts of different stuff.</i>

09:53.129 --> 09:55.076
Just bouncing on dicks,

09:55.153 --> 09:57.854
<i>and enjoying it the entire time.</i>

09:58.018 --> 10:00.690
<i>And they were, like,
making babies is one thing,</i>

10:00.904 --> 10:03.026
<i>God is another thing,</i>

10:03.432 --> 10:06.122
<i>our genitals are these fu...</i>

10:06.199 --> 10:08.958
<i>question marks dingly dangling...</i>

10:09.097 --> 10:13.094
<i>off the front of our fu...
mashed potato weirdo bodies,</i>

10:13.171 --> 10:14.940
<i>and we're going to figure it out.</i>

10:15.073 --> 10:17.448
<i>We're going to teach
everyone else about it.</i>

10:17.888 --> 10:21.046
<i>So Kinsey starts teaching
people about sex,</i>

10:21.198 --> 10:23.071
<i>and it was a huge success.</i>

10:23.148 --> 10:25.085
<i>Everyone wanted this information,</i>

10:25.222 --> 10:27.887
<i>and Kinsey's like,
I'm on to something here.</i>

10:27.964 --> 10:31.781
<i>We need to dive deep
on this subject of sex.</i>

10:31.959 --> 10:34.194
<i>Kinsey and his wife would
have these dinner parties</i>

10:34.271 --> 10:37.427
<i>that were kind of like
field studies in biology</i>

10:37.545 --> 10:38.720
<i>but for sex.</i>

10:38.797 --> 10:42.209
"Eyes Wide Shut" meets "Dead
Poets Society" basically.

10:42.342 --> 10:46.042
<i>Like, okay, I think
we've all had our fill</i>

10:46.119 --> 10:49.424
<i>of meatloaf and ice cream.</i>

10:49.501 --> 10:50.547
<i>Now...</i>

10:50.615 --> 10:54.224
<i>you. Why don't you pull your pants down,</i>

10:54.526 --> 10:57.802
<i>and let her start kissing your buns.</i>

10:57.998 --> 11:01.685
<i>And then, maybe it would
be great for science</i>

11:01.795 --> 11:03.345
<i>if you...</i>

11:03.498 --> 11:06.162
<i>came over there and
started eating her butt</i>

11:06.272 --> 11:08.325
<i>while she was sucking his di...</i>

11:08.393 --> 11:10.641
<i>And then they would, like,
take notes,</i>

11:10.718 --> 11:13.078
<i>and they were getting
all sorts of data</i>

11:13.146 --> 11:14.701
that was all about...

11:15.011 --> 11:17.126
F-U-C-K-I-N-G.

11:17.203 --> 11:18.204
Fu...?

11:18.281 --> 11:19.349
Yeah!

11:20.416 --> 11:22.831
So Mr. and Mrs. Kinsey

11:22.908 --> 11:26.068
have entered a new
phase in their marriage.

11:26.136 --> 11:28.140
<i>They're having sex with other dudes.</i>

11:28.325 --> 11:29.815
This is just...

11:29.892 --> 11:31.685
sexy science.

11:31.753 --> 11:33.322
<i>She's fu... dudes.</i>

11:33.596 --> 11:35.076
<i>He's fu... dudes.</i>

11:35.232 --> 11:37.355
<i>And Kinsey's like, oh, my God.</i>

11:37.432 --> 11:38.789
<i>I just had sex with a guy.</i>

11:38.857 --> 11:41.219
<i>I am so sorry.</i>

11:41.287 --> 11:42.829
<i>And she's like, dude...</i>

11:42.982 --> 11:45.488
<i>that is totally fine with me.</i>

11:45.565 --> 11:46.923
<i>I want to fu... dudes,</i>

11:47.000 --> 11:48.468
<i>and you want to fu... dudes,</i>

11:48.545 --> 11:49.842
<i>and we love each other.</i>

11:49.926 --> 11:54.381
<i>So let's just have, like,
a dude fu... household.</i>

11:54.793 --> 11:59.008
So, they're, like,
horny lovebirds,

11:59.076 --> 12:00.710
but they're also scientists.

12:00.787 --> 12:03.508
<i>Kinsey starts conducting
surveys with the students</i>

12:03.576 --> 12:06.466
<i>at the university like,
what are you turned on by?</i>

12:06.543 --> 12:08.876
<i>What have you done before,
sexually?</i>

12:08.953 --> 12:10.951
<i>What do you want to do,
sexually?</i>

12:11.136 --> 12:13.006
<i>And Kinsey would listen to all</i>

12:13.074 --> 12:16.107
<i>of these experiences and fantasies.</i>

12:16.262 --> 12:17.931
<i>And Kinsey was like,
oh, my God,</i>

12:18.008 --> 12:20.943
<i>everyone is a fu... pervert like I am.</i>

12:21.055 --> 12:25.839
This is the largest
survey of sex ever done.

12:25.908 --> 12:27.893
<i>And it suddenly occurred to him...</i>

12:27.961 --> 12:29.360
<i>Oh, my God...</i>

12:29.540 --> 12:31.381
<i>sexuality is not that simple.</i>

12:31.488 --> 12:33.162
<i>There's a whole scale.</i>

12:33.323 --> 12:35.631
<i>There's the Kinsey scale.</i>

12:35.913 --> 12:37.782
<i>He comes up with this idea that</i>

12:37.951 --> 12:41.357
<i>everyone has all of these grey areas</i>

12:41.443 --> 12:46.662
<i>that they're into from zero,
straight...</i>

12:46.926 --> 12:48.150
<i>boring,</i>

12:48.218 --> 12:49.975
<i>all the way up to six</i>

12:50.061 --> 12:53.420
<i>meaning, like, extremely homosexual.</i>

12:53.565 --> 12:57.626
Kinsey, people think,
fell somewhere around three or four

12:57.703 --> 13:00.326
<i>himself on that scale,
meaning he's, like,</i>

13:00.483 --> 13:02.889
<i>original bisexual,</i>

13:03.279 --> 13:04.981
<i>if you can imagine such a thing.</i>

13:05.176 --> 13:06.502
I can.

13:06.649 --> 13:08.225
I'm imagining it right now.

13:13.552 --> 13:17.713
Kinsey's books and research
were super important

13:17.790 --> 13:19.912
<i>to the sexual revolution of the '60s.</i>

13:20.045 --> 13:22.037
<i>It really just opened the door to a lot</i>

13:22.105 --> 13:23.488
of the modern ideers.

13:23.556 --> 13:26.100
"Iderrs" about sex.

13:26.225 --> 13:28.066
Have you ever tested
yourself on the scale?

13:28.143 --> 13:29.601
No, I've never taken the test.

13:29.678 --> 13:31.967
Wouldn't that be amazing if
I turned out to be straight?

13:32.528 --> 13:34.344
I got strictly homosexual.

13:34.412 --> 13:35.730
I think I'm finally ready

13:35.807 --> 13:37.727
to have my first sexual experience.

13:37.795 --> 13:39.412
- Are you serious?
- Yeah!

13:39.512 --> 13:41.062
<i>Cheers.</i>

13:41.530 --> 13:44.522
We're gonna make, like, a
not official old fashioned.

13:44.693 --> 13:46.100
Just a little bit.

13:46.168 --> 13:48.232
Just a little bit for you.

13:48.531 --> 13:49.644
Oh, yes.

13:49.729 --> 13:51.381
- That's what it's for.
- This really has

13:51.449 --> 13:53.139
multiple uses, this tool.

13:53.756 --> 13:55.951
It's a good ice breaker, stupid.

13:58.066 --> 13:59.475
Fu... you.

13:59.881 --> 14:01.186
Hello.

14:01.254 --> 14:02.640
I'm Katie Nolan,

14:02.717 --> 14:04.654
and today we're gonna talk

14:04.731 --> 14:06.459
about Gloria...

14:06.530 --> 14:08.139
Steinem.

14:08.698 --> 14:12.034
<i>Our story begins in the year 1963.</i>

14:12.102 --> 14:15.771
<i>Gloria Steinem was a
graduate of Smith College,</i>

14:15.873 --> 14:18.132
<i>very smart, she's 28 years old,</i>

14:18.200 --> 14:19.873
<i>and she's a journalist.</i>

14:20.014 --> 14:21.554
<i>And "Show Magazine" was like,</i>

14:21.622 --> 14:23.436
<i>hey, Gloria,
we have a story for you.</i>

14:23.537 --> 14:25.123
<i>We want you to go undercover</i>

14:25.191 --> 14:27.494
<i>at one of Hugh Hefner's Playboy clubs.</i>

14:27.654 --> 14:31.110
<i>And Playboy clubs were
advertising themselves</i>

14:31.178 --> 14:33.727
<i>at the time as, like, being
in a real live version</i>

14:33.804 --> 14:35.196
<i>of "Playboy."
So,</i>

14:35.264 --> 14:37.150
<i>you would have, like,
beautiful women everywhere,</i>

14:37.217 --> 14:38.868
<i>and drinks and food and "dude stuff."</i>

14:38.936 --> 14:41.506
<i>- Yeah!
- Boobies and vaginas!</i>

14:42.506 --> 14:43.836
And Gloria was like,

14:43.913 --> 14:45.447
<i>I don't think this is what I want.</i>

14:45.524 --> 14:47.458
<i>I want people to take me seriously.</i>

14:47.535 --> 14:48.774
<i>And her editor was like,</i>

14:48.842 --> 14:50.183
<i>I think this could be your chance</i>

14:50.260 --> 14:53.381
<i>to call Hugh Hefner out
on his Goddamn bullshit.</i>

14:53.614 --> 14:56.265
<i>And she was like,
you're right. I'm in.</i>

14:56.421 --> 14:58.625
<i>Let's fu... do it.</i>

14:58.818 --> 15:00.009
<i>Um.</i>

15:00.325 --> 15:02.390
Uh, what was I talking about?

15:02.467 --> 15:03.618
- Uh.
- So she says yes

15:03.695 --> 15:05.438
to the thing... to the assignment.

15:05.515 --> 15:07.056
<i>And so she goes to the audition</i>

15:07.133 --> 15:08.272
<i>which is at a Playboy club.</i>

15:08.349 --> 15:10.953
<i>So she's this alias
she's created for herself</i>

15:11.021 --> 15:13.399
<i>which is Marie Catherine Ochs.</i>

15:13.467 --> 15:15.281
<i>And the woman that
she goes up to says,</i>

15:15.358 --> 15:17.012
<i>take off your coat.
Let me see your body.</i>

15:17.089 --> 15:19.201
<i>Gloria was like, um, okay</i>

15:19.278 --> 15:20.480
<i>and, like, took her coat off.</i>

15:20.557 --> 15:21.914
<i>And the woman was like...</i>

15:21.982 --> 15:24.959
<i>you look a little old for 24,</i>

15:25.027 --> 15:26.287
<i>but your body's great.</i>

15:26.355 --> 15:29.445
<i>Come back on Saturday for a fitting.</i>

15:29.605 --> 15:32.938
<i>And so Gloria comes back
a couple of days later,</i>

15:33.006 --> 15:34.899
<i>and she sees
this woman named Sheralee.</i>

15:34.967 --> 15:36.562
<i>And she's like,
I'm the bunny mother.</i>

15:36.639 --> 15:38.196
<i>So she goes, and she gets sized.</i>

15:38.273 --> 15:41.190
<i>She puts on this leotard,
and she's like, this fits.</i>

15:41.267 --> 15:42.545
<i>And they're like, no it doesn't.</i>

15:42.612 --> 15:44.393
<i>And they keep going in and in.</i>

15:44.470 --> 15:47.072
<i>And Gloria's like,
I think that's tight enough.</i>

15:47.149 --> 15:48.748
<i>I can hardly breathe.</i>

15:51.744 --> 15:52.850
- I just had an ice...
- Are you good?

15:52.917 --> 15:54.843
An ice cube just assaulted me.

15:54.911 --> 15:56.116
You got ISIS-ed.

15:56.184 --> 15:58.157
Sorry.

15:59.847 --> 16:02.453
<i>So the bunny mother,
Sheralee, is explaining</i>

16:02.521 --> 16:03.541
<i>to the bunnies...</i>

16:03.609 --> 16:04.968
<i>there's all these things
that they can take</i>

16:05.035 --> 16:06.082
<i>your money away for;</i>

16:06.159 --> 16:08.249
<i>like, if your ears are crooked,</i>

16:08.326 --> 16:09.398
<i>that's a demerit.</i>

16:09.475 --> 16:12.030
<i>If your bunny tail's
dirty, that's demerits.</i>

16:12.098 --> 16:15.304
<i>If you're not smiling enough,
that's a bunch of demerits.</i>

16:15.372 --> 16:17.515
<i>They also give her this "Bunny Manual"</i>

16:17.583 --> 16:19.465
<i>which is a list of all the rules</i>

16:19.533 --> 16:20.695
<i>that you have to follow.</i>

16:20.763 --> 16:22.398
<i>And in the Bunny Manual, it says...</i>

16:22.594 --> 16:24.786
<i>you're not allowed to
date any customers.</i>

16:24.854 --> 16:26.412
<i>But then they were told</i>

16:26.655 --> 16:29.523
<i>unless they hold the special key.</i>

16:29.604 --> 16:31.541
<i>These special key members</i>

16:31.609 --> 16:34.052
were allowed to do
whatever they want.

16:34.129 --> 16:36.055
<i>Ew.</i>

16:36.235 --> 16:37.695
<i>That's fu... up.</i>

16:39.024 --> 16:40.916
Anyway.

16:41.054 --> 16:43.484
So, they're like, great,
you're all set.

16:43.569 --> 16:45.112
<i>You're going to start work soon.
We just need you</i>

16:45.179 --> 16:46.366
<i>to complete your physical.</i>

16:46.443 --> 16:48.201
<i>And Gloria's like,
what do you mean?</i>

16:48.278 --> 16:49.679
<i>I'm going to be a waitress.</i>

16:49.902 --> 16:52.171
<i>And, like, oh, we just need
you to complete a physical</i>

16:52.248 --> 16:53.461
<i>with this doctor,</i>

16:53.538 --> 16:54.973
<i>and then you'll be fine to start.</i>

16:55.050 --> 16:56.491
<i>- That's gross.
- Yeah.</i>

16:56.608 --> 16:58.226
<i>That's just gross.</i>

16:59.072 --> 17:00.999
<i>So, she goes to the doctor.</i>

17:01.079 --> 17:04.182
<i>She sits on the table, and
she sees there's stirrups.</i>

17:04.319 --> 17:06.093
And the doctor walks in,

17:06.161 --> 17:08.585
<i>and the first thing he says to her is...</i>

17:08.731 --> 17:10.623
<i>so you want to be a bunny.</i>

17:10.700 --> 17:13.929
Which is alarming, as a doctor.

17:14.064 --> 17:15.241
<i>He exams her,</i>

17:15.351 --> 17:16.694
<i>which to a woman means...</i>

17:16.771 --> 17:17.786
you know.

17:17.863 --> 17:18.939
Pap smear?

17:19.007 --> 17:20.422
Did you say "patch" smear?

17:20.499 --> 17:23.067
- I've never had one.
- It's not a bagel, Derek.

17:23.135 --> 17:25.366
- It's a... It's a...
- I'm from New York, eh.

17:25.473 --> 17:27.954
- I'ma gettin' a pap "schmear."
- I'ma gettin' a pap "schmear."

17:29.269 --> 17:31.467
So, she finishes the exam.

17:31.655 --> 17:35.530
And she goes the next
day to train for this job.

17:35.640 --> 17:37.340
<i>That's a fancy word for</i>

17:37.417 --> 17:39.804
<i>you're going to work and
not get paid any money.</i>

17:40.282 --> 17:42.167
She's training as a table bunny.

17:42.268 --> 17:44.693
<i>And they teach her
that she has to follow</i>

17:44.770 --> 17:47.077
<i>the other bunny servers around,</i>

17:47.156 --> 17:49.138
<i>and so she's going around,
asking these people, like,</i>

17:49.205 --> 17:51.986
<i>hello, I'm bunny Marie.
What can I get for you?</i>

17:52.063 --> 17:53.498
<i>And they would say things like,</i>

17:53.575 --> 17:56.523
<i>yeah, girl, let me see your titties.</i>

17:56.767 --> 17:58.213
<i>Open it up.</i>

17:58.321 --> 18:00.140
Which is bullshit.

18:00.257 --> 18:02.221
How many times are you allowed
to say bullshit on Comedy Central?

18:02.288 --> 18:04.024
- I've said it a whole bunch.
- Whenever you want.

18:04.091 --> 18:06.374
Okay.
It's some bullshit.

18:08.253 --> 18:09.914
Do you want me to
teach you how to bunny?

18:09.982 --> 18:12.499
Yes, all right. So, when I walk...
How do I walk?

18:12.567 --> 18:14.126
Well, so, it will be on a tray,

18:14.273 --> 18:16.030
and I need you to be
on your tippy toes

18:16.098 --> 18:17.296
all the way up.

18:17.364 --> 18:19.140
- Higher than that.
- This is all I can go.

18:19.208 --> 18:21.913
And then cross your legs
when you walk.

18:21.981 --> 18:24.183
Bend over the table
to serve the drink.

18:24.251 --> 18:25.530
- Butt out.
- Mm-hmm.

18:25.598 --> 18:27.552
Titties out.

18:28.125 --> 18:29.864
Go away, you slut.

18:30.206 --> 18:31.487
Anyway.

18:31.770 --> 18:33.137
<i>She's working all of these shifts,</i>

18:33.205 --> 18:34.385
<i>and she's like, in her journal,</i>

18:34.452 --> 18:35.981
<i>she's writing all these injustices.</i>

18:36.049 --> 18:37.691
<i>They're, like,
working these long hours.</i>

18:37.869 --> 18:39.480
<i>They're not making any money.</i>

18:39.573 --> 18:40.637
<i>On top of that,</i>

18:40.705 --> 18:42.465
<i>it's basically a prostitution ring.</i>

18:42.533 --> 18:44.551
<i>And finally, after working
in the Playboy clubs</i>

18:44.619 --> 18:45.989
<i>for four weeks,</i>

18:46.057 --> 18:47.797
<i>Gloria was like,
fu... this shit.</i>

18:47.977 --> 18:49.504
<i>I have enough in my journal.</i>

18:49.572 --> 18:51.379
<i>I'm gonna publish this shit.</i>

18:51.678 --> 18:52.692
<i>I'm out.</i>

18:52.872 --> 18:56.770
<i>It's just all the stupid
sexist dumbass bullshit.</i>

18:56.915 --> 18:58.818
She just wanted
to get the fu... out.

18:59.200 --> 19:00.500
And so she quit.

19:00.739 --> 19:01.781
<i>And so</i>

19:01.865 --> 19:04.465
<i>Gloria writes an expose
on these Playboy clubs.</i>

19:04.533 --> 19:06.356
<i>She's like these women were like...</i>

19:06.454 --> 19:07.856
<i>not making as much money</i>

19:07.925 --> 19:09.110
<i>as they were told they
were going to make.</i>

19:09.177 --> 19:10.825
<i>It's insane hours.</i>

19:10.925 --> 19:12.871
<i>They're being grabbed
all the time.</i>

19:12.939 --> 19:15.004
<i>They're treated like prostitutes.</i>

19:15.072 --> 19:17.137
<i>They're basically being
used as a tool</i>

19:17.205 --> 19:20.067
<i>for the male sexual revolution.</i>

19:20.158 --> 19:21.371
<i>But the women themselves</i>

19:21.439 --> 19:23.145
<i>don't get to own their sexuality,</i>

19:23.234 --> 19:25.356
<i>and that's shitty.</i>

19:26.312 --> 19:27.856
<i>So they publishes...</i>

19:27.924 --> 19:29.366
<i>they publishes...</i>

19:29.437 --> 19:30.576
<i>They publ...</i>

19:30.723 --> 19:32.723
- They publish...
- Mm-mm.

19:32.791 --> 19:35.520
<i>They publish the story
in the magazine.</i>

19:35.743 --> 19:38.046
<i>So, the world reads this article,</i>

19:38.155 --> 19:40.801
<i>and to his very tiny credit,</i>

19:40.880 --> 19:42.989
<i>Hugh Hefner says
wow...</i>

19:43.193 --> 19:45.329
<i>Yeah, maybe they won't have to go</i>

19:45.397 --> 19:47.448
<i>to these physical exams anymore.</i>

19:47.516 --> 19:48.547
<i>And you know what,</i>

19:48.615 --> 19:50.276
<i>I'm going to stop
making them</i>

19:50.416 --> 19:53.026
<i>have to give so much
of their money to us</i>

19:53.120 --> 19:54.433
<i>if they make a mistake.</i>

19:54.501 --> 19:56.314
Which is, like, a really cool thing...

19:56.382 --> 19:57.956
that Hugh Hefner did.

19:58.065 --> 20:01.526
Um, but also,
not as cool as just, like,

20:01.645 --> 20:03.558
always treating them that way.

20:03.702 --> 20:07.714
<i>This article made Gloria
Steinem a household name,</i>

20:07.845 --> 20:09.276
<i>and she went on to be this...</i>

20:09.397 --> 20:12.019
<i>huge feminist icon.</i>

20:12.136 --> 20:13.979
It's tough, but I swear to God,

20:14.047 --> 20:15.448
if it weren't for Gloria Steinem

20:15.516 --> 20:17.722
I wouldn't be able to be on TV.

20:17.790 --> 20:21.269
It's very hard to be a woman
that's like, I love sports.

20:21.374 --> 20:23.043
And you have stuck to your guns

20:23.167 --> 20:24.878
ever since you've started.

20:24.946 --> 20:26.128
And that...

20:26.762 --> 20:27.864
is what...

20:27.932 --> 20:29.323
You cried.

20:29.391 --> 20:30.690
I'm sorry.

20:31.378 --> 20:33.425
Can I get somebody else to do...

20:33.493 --> 20:34.815
to do this?
