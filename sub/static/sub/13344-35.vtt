WEBVTT

00:05.773 --> 00:08.576
Man:
PREVIOUSLY ON
"IN TREATMENT"...

00:08.676 --> 00:10.378
KATE RAN INTO LAURA.

00:10.478 --> 00:13.381
WHAT I SAW WAS
THIS HIGHLY-SEXUAL WOMAN

00:13.481 --> 00:15.416
WHO WAS WEARING STILETTOS
AT 10:00 IN THE MORNING.

00:15.516 --> 00:17.585
ISN'T IT A LITTLE
EMBARRASSING FOR YOU,

00:17.685 --> 00:20.788
FOLLOWING YOUR DICK
AROUND LIKE A CAVEMAN?

00:20.888 --> 00:23.224
KATE, I FELL IN LOVE
WITH YOU NOT JUST
BECAUSE YOU'RE...

00:23.324 --> 00:25.559
BEAUTIFUL AND SEXY
BUT BECAUSE OF YOUR STRENGTH.

00:25.659 --> 00:28.362
I NEEDED THAT.
I THINK WE BOTH
NEEDED THAT.

00:28.462 --> 00:30.564
NOT ANYMORE.
I DON'T NEED YOU ANYMORE.

00:30.664 --> 00:32.966
Gina:
YOU KNOW, YOU SAID
YOU MARRIED HIM

00:33.067 --> 00:35.469
BECAUSE HE PAID SUCH
DEEP ATTENTION TO YOU.

00:35.569 --> 00:38.339
YOU'VE OUTGROWN
THAT DEPENDENCY.

00:38.439 --> 00:40.241
SO SHE'S NOT
MY GROUPIE ANYMORE

00:40.341 --> 00:42.243
SO I FOUND SOMEBODY
TO REPLACE HER.

00:42.343 --> 00:44.312
IS THAT YOUR THEORY?
YOU SEE WHAT SHE'S DOING?

00:44.412 --> 00:47.315
SHE'S INSTRUCTING YOU
ON WHAT YOU SHOULD BE FEELING.

00:47.415 --> 00:49.583
GAME, SET AND MATCH
TO YOU, GINA.

00:56.957 --> 00:59.059
( phone ringing )

01:00.728 --> 01:02.396
HELLO?

01:02.496 --> 01:04.898
OH, HI.

01:04.998 --> 01:06.500
SO, UM...

01:06.600 --> 01:09.437
SO, WHAT DID
THE DERMATOLOGIST SAY?

01:10.371 --> 01:11.572
MM-HMM.

01:14.108 --> 01:15.709
OKAY, SO DON'T LOOK
IN THE MIRROR, SOPHIE.

01:15.809 --> 01:19.079
YEAH, COVER THE MIRROR UP
WITH A TOWEL OR SOMETHING.

01:19.180 --> 01:21.048
I'M ORDERING YOU
NOT TO LOOK AT IT.

01:21.149 --> 01:22.283
DOCTOR'S ORDERS, OKAY?

01:22.383 --> 01:25.119
TAKE IT
AS A CHALLENGE.

01:25.219 --> 01:27.755
MM-HMM. IT'LL PASS.

01:27.855 --> 01:30.291
I PROMISE.

01:30.391 --> 01:32.360
GOOD, SO CALL ME
IF YOU NEED ME.

01:32.460 --> 01:35.062
BYE.

01:35.163 --> 01:36.597
POOR THING.

01:36.697 --> 01:39.567
WHO'S THAT?

01:39.667 --> 01:41.902
A PATIENT ROSIE'S AGE.
SHE THINKS SHE'S A FREAK.

01:42.002 --> 01:45.506
NOW SHE'S GOT
A RASH ALL OVER
HER BODY TO PROVE IT.

01:45.606 --> 01:47.808
OH, IS IT THAT
SWEET GIRL THAT I HELPED
INTO THE DRY CLOTHES?

01:47.908 --> 01:49.710
YES.

01:49.810 --> 01:51.712
WHERE ARE MY KEYS?

01:51.812 --> 01:54.215
GOD, DO YOU REMEMBER
WHEN IAN USED TO GET
THOSE RASHES

01:54.315 --> 01:56.917
EVERY TIME HE GOT THE FLU?
SO SCARY.

01:57.017 --> 01:59.787
IT DIDN'T HELP THAT
I PUT THE WRONG CREAM
ON HIM THAT TIME.

01:59.887 --> 02:01.622
DO YOU REMEMBER?

02:07.628 --> 02:09.697
THE SPIDER AWAITS.
LET'S GO.

02:09.797 --> 02:11.765
( theme music playing )

02:28.282 --> 02:31.419
SO... ROSIE KNOWS.

02:31.519 --> 02:35.155
SHE ASKED IF PAUL AND I
WERE FIGHTING

02:35.256 --> 02:37.325
AND I STARTED OFF

02:37.425 --> 02:39.493
INTO THIS RATHER
CLICHED SPEECH

02:39.593 --> 02:41.529
ABOUT, YOU KNOW,
"WHEN TWO PEOPLE
HAVE BEEN TOGETHER

02:41.629 --> 02:43.797
AS LONG AS YOUR FATHER
AND I HAVE,

02:43.897 --> 02:45.299
IT'S NOT SOME
ROMANTIC MOVIE

02:45.399 --> 02:47.201
WHERE EVERYBODY LIVES
HAPPILY EVER AFTER--"

02:47.301 --> 02:49.703
WHATEVER. WHATEVER.

02:49.803 --> 02:52.373
AS IF THAT'S
WHAT SHE THOUGHT
TO BEGIN WITH,

02:52.473 --> 02:54.342
LIKE SHE'S SOME
LITTLE GIRL.

02:56.310 --> 02:58.346
WHAT DID SHE SAY?

02:58.446 --> 03:01.382
TYPICAL ROSIE--
SHE CUT RIGHT
TO THE CHASE

03:01.482 --> 03:04.051
AND SHE ASKED ME
IF I WAS SLEEPING
WITH SOMEBODY.

03:04.151 --> 03:06.754
Gina:
WHY WOULD SHE
SUSPECT THAT?

03:08.889 --> 03:10.758
WHEN I WAS IN ROME,

03:10.858 --> 03:12.693
SHE CALLED ME

03:12.793 --> 03:16.163
AND SHE HEARD EDWARD
IN THE BACKGROUND.

03:16.264 --> 03:17.831
OF COURSE, SHE DOESN'T
TELL ME THIS THOUGH,

03:17.931 --> 03:21.034
SO... I GOT DEFENSIVE.

03:21.134 --> 03:23.070
I GOT KINDA VAGUE

03:23.170 --> 03:25.506
AND I SAID,
"WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
THAT I'M SEEING SOMEBODY?"

03:25.606 --> 03:28.208
I ALMOST SAID, "WHY ME?
WHY NOT YOUR FATHER?"

03:28.309 --> 03:30.611
BUT THANK GOD
I DIDN'T.

03:32.546 --> 03:34.782
FINALLY SHE TOLD ME
THAT SHE KNEW.

03:41.889 --> 03:44.091
WHAT ABOUT THE BOYS?

03:44.191 --> 03:47.361
WELL, I SPOKE TO IAN.
NOT ABOUT KATE'S--

03:47.461 --> 03:48.762
KATE'S AFFAIR BUT, UM...

03:48.862 --> 03:52.099
JUST ABOUT THE TENSION
IN THE HOUSE.

03:52.199 --> 03:53.901
WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ME ABOUT THAT?

03:54.001 --> 03:55.336
WELL, I'M TELLING YOU NOW.

03:55.436 --> 03:58.572
WHY CAN WE NOT TALK
ABOUT THIS AT HOME?

03:58.672 --> 04:00.841
I DON'T
UNDERSTAND THAT.

04:00.941 --> 04:03.143
- WHAT DID YOU SAY TO HIM?
- I SAID WE WERE WORKING

04:03.243 --> 04:04.678
THROUGH SOME DISAGREEMENTS.

04:04.778 --> 04:07.915
HE ASKED ME
IF I WAS INTERESTED
IN ANYBODY ELSE,

04:08.015 --> 04:09.850
AND I SAID THAT I HAD

04:09.950 --> 04:13.186
FEELINGS
FOR SOMEBODY ELSE

04:13.287 --> 04:15.589
BUT THAT NOTHING
HAD HAPPENED.

04:17.791 --> 04:21.295
WELL, THAT'S GREAT.
THAT'S JUST REALLY GREAT.

04:21.395 --> 04:22.763
DID YOU THINK
FOR A MINUTE THAT MAYBE

04:22.863 --> 04:24.532
THAT WAS SOMETHING
WE COULD'VE HANDLED TOGETHER?

04:24.632 --> 04:26.334
I'D JUST SPOKEN TO ROSIE.
SHE SAID TO ME,

04:26.434 --> 04:29.069
"WHY ARE YOU
ALLOWING YOUR WIFE

04:29.169 --> 04:31.439
TO GO TO ROME
WITH SOMEBODY ELSE, DAD?

04:31.539 --> 04:34.408
FIX IT, DAD."
THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID.

04:34.508 --> 04:36.610
LIKE IT WAS ALL
UP TO ME... AGAIN.

04:36.710 --> 04:40.681
AND JUST AFTER THAT,
IAN CAME IN, SO...
( sighs )

04:40.781 --> 04:43.617
I DON'T KNOW, I JUST FELT
LIKE I WANTED TO COME CLEAN.

04:43.717 --> 04:45.619
Gina:
HOW DO YOU THINK
HE TOOK THAT,

04:45.719 --> 04:47.621
YOU HAVING FEELINGS
FOR SOMEONE ELSE?

04:47.721 --> 04:51.024
WELL, I THINK
IT HIT HIM HARD

04:51.124 --> 04:52.826
BUT, YOU KNOW,
HE TOUGHED IT OUT.

04:52.926 --> 04:56.063
"IT'S OKAY, DAD, IT'S COOL."
THAT KIND OF THING.

04:56.163 --> 04:57.798
Kate:
WELL, THAT'S NO SURPRISE.

04:57.898 --> 05:00.601
IAN'S ALWAYS
BEEN ON PAUL'S SIDE
OF THE ARGUMENT, ALWAYS.

05:00.701 --> 05:02.503
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.
- Kate: YES, IT IS TRUE.

05:02.603 --> 05:04.171
YOU'RE ALWAYS
THE POOR, INNOCENT LAMB

05:04.271 --> 05:05.906
AND I'M ALWAYS
THE MONSTER. IT IS TRUE.

05:06.006 --> 05:07.675
WHEN IN FACT,
YOU'RE BLAMELESS,
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE

05:07.775 --> 05:10.778
- TRYING TO SAY?
- NO, THAT'S NOT
WHAT I'M SAYING.

05:10.878 --> 05:13.414
YOU KNOW YOU'VE NEVER
ONCE-- ONCE-- TAKEN

05:13.514 --> 05:14.915
RESPONSIBILITY
FOR WHAT YOU DID?

05:15.015 --> 05:16.917
YOU'VE BEEN SITTING
HERE FOR THREE WEEKS

05:17.017 --> 05:19.487
AND YOU NEVER ONCE
SAID, "I'M SORRY,
I MADE A MISTAKE."

05:19.587 --> 05:21.288
REALLY, I'VE NEVER
SAID THAT?

05:21.389 --> 05:23.023
- I'VE HEARD HER
SAY THAT.
- WHEN?

05:23.123 --> 05:26.660
I'VE HEARD HER SAY THAT
A NUMBER OF TIMES-- HERE.

05:26.760 --> 05:28.996
ACTUALLY, ONE TIME SHE SAID
IT WAS A STUPID MISTAKE.

05:29.096 --> 05:32.099
- I DIDN'T HEAR THAT.
- 'CAUSE YOU DON'T
WANNA HEAR IT.

05:33.701 --> 05:35.436
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
BY THAT, KATE?

05:35.536 --> 05:37.938
IF HE'D HEARD IT,
IT WOULD FORCE HIM
INTO DECIDING

05:38.038 --> 05:39.540
WHETHER HE'S WILLING
TO FORGIVE ME OR NOT,

05:39.640 --> 05:41.375
AND HE'S OBVIOUSLY NOT
WILLING TO FORGIVE ME

05:41.475 --> 05:44.144
BECAUSE HE HASN'T
MADE UP HIS MIND
ABOUT THIS OTHER WOMAN YET.

05:44.244 --> 05:46.380
WOW.

05:46.480 --> 05:49.850
WOW. ANYTHING ELSE
I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT ME?

05:54.187 --> 05:56.790
BY THE WAY, ANOTHER THING
WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT--

05:56.890 --> 05:59.427
YOU KEEP SAYING THAT
I HAVEN'T BEEN AROUND,

05:59.527 --> 06:01.595
THAT I DON'T SEE MY KIDS,
THAT I DON'T SEE,

06:01.695 --> 06:05.633
THAT I DON'T GIVE,
THAT I ONLY FOCUS ON MYSELF.

06:05.733 --> 06:08.969
CAN WE TALK ABOUT WHAT KIND
OF MOTHER YOU'VE BEEN?

06:09.069 --> 06:10.738
CAN WE TALK ABOUT THAT?

06:13.140 --> 06:15.308
YEAH, SURE. OKAY.

06:15.409 --> 06:17.010
LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT.

06:17.110 --> 06:18.479
Paul: OKAY.

06:18.579 --> 06:21.915
IMPATIENT, NAGGING--
JUST ASK THEM,

06:22.015 --> 06:23.484
THEY'LL TELL YOU.

06:23.584 --> 06:25.218
ANYTHING THEY DO ISN'T
GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU.

06:25.318 --> 06:27.788
OKAY.

06:27.888 --> 06:29.823
YOU SHOULD REALLY
BE QUIET RIGHT NOW

06:29.923 --> 06:32.025
'CAUSE YOU'RE SORT OF
EMBARRASSING YOURSELF.

06:32.125 --> 06:35.228
WHERE THE HELL HAVE YOU
BEEN FOR THE PAST YEAR?

06:35.328 --> 06:37.330
PAST YEAR? WHAT ABOUT
THE PAST DECADE?

06:37.431 --> 06:39.199
YOU DON'T KNOW A THING
ABOUT YOUR CHILDREN--

06:39.299 --> 06:41.569
IAN, MAYBE
A LITTLE BIT.

06:41.669 --> 06:44.572
MAX? ROSIE? JESUS.

06:44.672 --> 06:46.774
YOU DON'T KNOW WHO
SHE'S HANGING OUT WITH,

06:46.874 --> 06:48.842
WHAT SHE DOES.
YOU DON'T HAVE A CLUE.

06:48.942 --> 06:51.845
HE STILL THINKS
THAT SHE'S THIS
VIRGINAL LITTLE THING

06:51.945 --> 06:54.848
WHO DOESN'T
GO OFF WITH HER FRIENDS
AND PARTY OR TRY DRUGS.

06:54.948 --> 06:58.919
- THAT SHE'S JUST THIS...
DADDY'S LITTLE GIRL.
- WHAT DRUGS?

07:00.588 --> 07:02.923
COME ON,
I'M ASKING YOU:

07:03.023 --> 07:04.858
WHAT DRUGS?

07:08.462 --> 07:10.564
LOOK, SHE GOES TO CONCERTS
WITH HER FRIENDS

07:10.664 --> 07:12.432
AND SHE SMOKES POT,

07:12.533 --> 07:14.535
BUT, YOU KNOW, I GUESS
BECAUSE SHE'S YOUR DAUGHTER

07:14.635 --> 07:18.038
YOU THINK SHE DOESN'T
DO THAT SORT OF THING.

07:18.138 --> 07:21.374
DID SHE TELL YOU THAT?
THAT SHE SMOKES POT?

07:21.475 --> 07:22.776
WHO ELSE CAN
SHE TELL?

07:22.876 --> 07:25.946
- SHE COULD'VE TOLD ME.
- REALLY?

07:31.384 --> 07:33.253
SO WHAT DID YOU
SAY TO HER?

07:33.353 --> 07:36.890
I TOLD HER THAT,
IF SHE DID IT ONCE,
THAT IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

07:36.990 --> 07:38.726
THAT ONE JOINT
IS CERTAINLY NOT
GONNA MAKE YOU A JUNKIE.

07:38.826 --> 07:41.428
SO BASICALLY
YOU SAID IT'S OKAY

07:41.529 --> 07:43.330
IF SHE GETS HIGH
AND SMOKES POT.

07:43.430 --> 07:44.898
COME ON, ALL OF
HER FRIENDS SMOKE.

07:44.998 --> 07:46.634
- THAT'S WHAT THEY DO.
- Paul: SO?

07:46.734 --> 07:48.368
SHE TRIED SOME,
SHE WANTED TO TALK ABOUT IT.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.871
ALL HER FRIENDS SMOKE.
SO YOU BUY INTO THAT?

07:50.971 --> 07:52.706
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M REALLY HAPPY
THAT SHE FEELS

07:52.806 --> 07:54.474
THAT SHE CAN COME TO ME
AND TALK TO ME ABOUT IT.

07:54.575 --> 07:56.644
I FEEL REALLY GOOD
ABOUT THAT.

08:00.914 --> 08:03.617
SO IS THIS HOW
SHE GOT INVOLVED
WITH THIS NOAH GUY?

08:04.785 --> 08:06.654
NOAH IS
ROSIE'S BOYFRIEND.

08:06.754 --> 08:08.922
NO, SHE'S INTO NOAH
BECAUSE HE'S A BOY.

08:09.022 --> 08:12.325
IT'S GOT NOTHING TO DO
WITH DRUGS WHATSOEVER.

08:12.425 --> 08:14.194
ARE THEY SLEEPING
WITH EACH OTHER?

08:18.231 --> 08:19.867
YES OR NO?

08:30.143 --> 08:31.845
ROSIE'S ON THE PILL.

08:36.449 --> 08:39.853
BUT, I MEAN,
YOU'RE SO CLOSE TO HER,
YOU MUST KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

08:44.725 --> 08:47.060
HOW DID YOU
FIND THIS OUT?

08:55.736 --> 08:57.504
I TOOK HER
TO THE GYNECOLOGIST MYSELF

08:57.605 --> 09:01.575
- ABOUT THREE MONTHS AGO.
- WHY WOULDN'T YOU
TELL ME THAT?

09:01.675 --> 09:04.044
BECAUSE SHE
ASKED ME NOT TO.

09:04.144 --> 09:06.513
SO?

09:06.614 --> 09:08.716
WELL, IT'S BETWEEN
HER AND ME, PAUL.

09:08.816 --> 09:10.784
WOW, SEX AND DRUGS, NICE.

09:10.884 --> 09:12.552
THEY'RE NOT IN
THE SAME CATEGORY.

09:12.653 --> 09:13.854
DO YOU KNOW
HOW OFTEN SHE SMOKES?

09:13.954 --> 09:15.522
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT SHE SMOKES?

09:15.623 --> 09:16.924
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT THEY PUT
IN THIS SHIT NOW?

09:17.024 --> 09:18.726
IS SHE KEEPING YOU
UP TO DATE ON THAT?

09:18.826 --> 09:21.561
SHE'S NOT A DRUG ADDICT,
SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST RELAX?

09:21.662 --> 09:23.496
I'M NOT GONNA RELAX
BECAUSE THIS ISN'T ABOUT

09:23.597 --> 09:25.032
WHETHER ROSIE
SMOKES POT OR NOT.

09:25.132 --> 09:27.200
IT'S ABOUT YOU
KEEPING IT FROM ME.

09:27.300 --> 09:28.836
THAT'S THE ISSUE.

09:28.936 --> 09:30.804
YOU TOOK HER
TO A GYNECOLOGIST
WITHOUT TELLING ME.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.873
- SHE'S A CHILD.
- SHE'S NOT A CHILD.

09:32.973 --> 09:35.108
SHE'S OUR CHILD-- OURS.

09:41.348 --> 09:44.618
WELL, I GUESS
YOU KIND OF ENJOYED
KEEPING IT FROM ME.

09:44.718 --> 09:47.621
GIVES YOU SOME KIND
OF CONTROL, DOES IT?

09:47.721 --> 09:49.757
GOT SUCH A KICK OUT
OF YOUR LITTLE CONSPIRACY,

09:49.857 --> 09:51.925
YOU FORGOT TO BE
CONCERNED ABOUT ROSIE.

09:52.025 --> 09:54.527
NOT EVERYTHING I DO
IS FOR YOUR BENEFIT.

09:54.628 --> 09:56.997
- DOES IAN SMOKE POT?
- OH, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.

09:57.097 --> 09:59.332
IN COLLEGE?
I CERTAINLY HOPE NOT.

09:59.432 --> 10:00.768
WELL, IT APPEARS I LIVE

10:00.868 --> 10:03.570
IN SOME KIND OF
AN ALTERNATE REALITY.

10:03.671 --> 10:05.572
IF ONE OF HER TEACHERS
KEPT THAT KIND OF

10:05.673 --> 10:07.007
INFORMATION FROM ME,
IT WOULD BE BAD.

10:07.107 --> 10:09.042
BUT YOU'RE HER MOTHER.
IT'S WORSE.

10:09.142 --> 10:11.344
IT MAKES IT
A HUNDRED TIMES WORSE.

10:16.750 --> 10:18.451
PAUL, LET'S LOOK

10:18.551 --> 10:20.387
AT HOW YOU'RE REACTING.

10:21.655 --> 10:23.290
NOW KATE WAS SAYING

10:23.390 --> 10:25.525
THAT THIS IS
WHY SHE'S AFRAID
TO TELL YOU THINGS,

10:25.625 --> 10:28.428
- ROSIE TOO.
- WHO WOULDN'T BE
PISSED OFF

10:28.528 --> 10:30.097
IF THEIR WIFE
DIDN'T TELL THEM,

10:30.197 --> 10:31.832
IF THEIR WIFE
DIDN'T INCLUDE THEM?

10:31.932 --> 10:33.801
THERE ARE REASONS
TO BE ANGRY.

10:33.901 --> 10:36.670
BUT CAN YOU LOOK
BEYOND THAT FOR A MINUTE?

10:36.770 --> 10:40.473
KATE'S TRYING TO TELL YOU
SOMETHING ABOUT ROSIE,

10:40.573 --> 10:43.443
ABOUT HER
RELATIONSHIP WITH ROSIE.
YOU'RE NOT HEARING IT.

10:43.543 --> 10:46.446
- I THINK I AM.
- NO, YOU'RE NOT.

10:46.546 --> 10:48.315
NO, THE WAY
YOU'RE LOOKING AT IT,

10:48.415 --> 10:51.084
THEY'RE EXCLUDING YOU,

10:51.184 --> 10:53.987
BUT KATE'S TALKING ABOUT
THEIR OWN RELATIONSHIP,

10:54.087 --> 10:56.656
THEIR INTIMACY,
THEIR TRUST.

11:03.630 --> 11:07.434
YOU KNOW, LAST WEEK
WHEN YOU WERE HERE,

11:07.534 --> 11:09.602
YOU HAD
A LEGITIMATE CONCERN

11:09.703 --> 11:11.805
ABOUT ROSIE WHEN
SHE DISAPPEARED FOR A DAY.

11:11.905 --> 11:14.908
WE'RE BACK HERE
AGAIN TODAY

11:15.008 --> 11:17.177
AND WE'RE STILL
TALKING ABOUT ROSIE.

11:17.277 --> 11:19.813
NOW A LOT OF THESE THINGS
ARE IMPORTANT.

11:19.913 --> 11:22.916
THEY ABSOLUTELY
SHOULD BE ADDRESSED,

11:23.016 --> 11:24.384
BUT I'M WONDERING
IF WE DON'T

11:24.484 --> 11:27.054
KEEP ON TALKING
ABOUT ROSIE

11:27.154 --> 11:31.324
BECAUSE WE'RE
AVOIDING THE ISSUES
THAT BROUGHT YOU HERE.

11:44.704 --> 11:46.339
( clears throat )

11:47.174 --> 11:48.408
OKAY.

11:48.508 --> 11:50.343
LET'S TRY IMAGO.

11:59.352 --> 12:00.487
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

12:00.587 --> 12:02.890
COME ON, GINA,
YOU'RE KIDDING.

12:02.990 --> 12:05.759
PAUL, I'M TRYING TO GET
A DIALOGUE STARTED.

12:05.859 --> 12:08.962
WAIT. HELLO,
WHAT'S IMAGO?

12:09.062 --> 12:12.833
IT'S THIS
POP PSYCHOLOGY

12:12.933 --> 12:15.668
FROM THE '80s.
THE MOST EARNEST
KIND OF BULLSHIT.

12:15.769 --> 12:17.370
PAUL.

12:17.470 --> 12:19.506
IT'S A TYPE
OF COUPLES THERAPY

12:19.606 --> 12:21.408
WHERE YOU REFLECT
EACH OTHER'S FEELINGS.

12:21.508 --> 12:23.710
WHEN I USED TO
WORK WITH YOU,
YOU USED TO LAUGH AT IT.

12:23.811 --> 12:26.413
THERE'S A LOT OF IT
THAT'S... BULLSHIT.

12:26.513 --> 12:27.848
YEAH.

12:27.948 --> 12:31.284
BUT IT CAN BE USEFUL

12:31.384 --> 12:34.221
TO GET A DIALOGUE GOING.

12:34.321 --> 12:36.924
WE CAN DO IT
FOR A LITTLE WHILE
AND THEN WE'LL DROP IT.

12:37.024 --> 12:40.160
SO-- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
WHEN YOU SAY "REFLECT"--

12:40.260 --> 12:42.262
GINA, PLEASE DON'T
MAKE US DO THIS.

12:42.362 --> 12:45.132
CAN I UNDERSTAND
WHAT IT IS BEFORE
WE MAKE THAT DECISION?

12:50.170 --> 12:51.338
OKAY.

12:52.940 --> 12:56.143
WHAT PAUL SAID WAS RIGHT.
IT'S ABOUT REFLECTION.

12:56.243 --> 12:59.012
ONE PERSON BEGINS
AND THE OTHER PERSON...

12:59.112 --> 13:00.814
ANSWERS.

13:00.914 --> 13:04.084
SO PAUL WILL SAY,

13:04.184 --> 13:07.888
"I'M UPSET ABOUT
WHAT YOU DID LAST NIGHT."

13:07.988 --> 13:10.657
AND YOU RESPOND,
"I HEAR THAT YOU'RE UPSET

13:10.757 --> 13:12.159
ABOUT MY BEHAVIOR
LAST NIGHT."

13:12.259 --> 13:15.795
AND PAUL WILL CONFIRM
OR HE'LL CORRECT YOU

13:15.896 --> 13:17.430
IF YOU LEFT
SOMETHING OUT.

13:17.530 --> 13:19.632
WE DO THAT
FOR A WHILE

13:19.732 --> 13:23.203
AND THEN THE LISTENING PERSON
SUMMARIZES WHAT THEY HEARD.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.205
THOSE OF US
WHO CAN STILL HEAR.

13:25.305 --> 13:27.074
THE MORE YOU BITCH
ABOUT THIS, THE MORE
I WANNA DO IT,

13:27.174 --> 13:29.409
- SO JUST--
- OF COURSE.

13:29.509 --> 13:31.912
HOW DO
WE START, GINA?

13:32.012 --> 13:33.446
OKAY, SO TURN SO
YOU'RE FACING EACH OTHER.

13:33.546 --> 13:36.316
OH, GINA.

13:36.416 --> 13:38.318
WELL, WE'RE DEFINITELY
DOING IT NOW, SO--

13:38.418 --> 13:41.621
Gina:
OKAY, FACE EACH OTHER.
PAUL, WOULD YOU FACE--

13:41.721 --> 13:43.290
OKAY, FINE FINE FINE.

13:43.390 --> 13:45.658
WE'LL DO AN IMAGO.

13:45.758 --> 13:48.228
OKAY, MOVE IN
A LITTLE CLOSER.

13:52.732 --> 13:54.467
WHO WANTS
TO GO FIRST?

13:54.567 --> 13:56.336
ME, I WILL.

13:57.404 --> 13:58.872
OKAY.

14:00.507 --> 14:02.542
OH...

14:04.777 --> 14:06.146
HE ONLY REPEATS, RIGHT?
THAT'S IT.

14:06.246 --> 14:07.647
THAT'S RIGHT,
NOTHING ELSE--

14:07.747 --> 14:09.649
NO COMMENTS,
NO REACTIONS,

14:09.749 --> 14:12.385
- NO ANALYSIS.
- OKAY.

14:12.485 --> 14:14.955
LIKING THIS ALREADY.

14:16.223 --> 14:19.126
DURING THESE
SESSIONS WITH GINA,

14:19.226 --> 14:22.762
I'VE STARTED
TO LEARN A LOT

14:22.862 --> 14:24.898
ABOUT MYSELF...

14:24.998 --> 14:26.900
AND ABOUT YOU.

14:28.368 --> 14:29.903
Gina: PAUL?

14:30.003 --> 14:31.604
YEAH, I...

14:33.640 --> 14:36.076
I HEAR YOU SAY

14:36.176 --> 14:37.610
SINCE WE'VE BEEN
SEEING GINA,

14:37.710 --> 14:39.146
YOU'VE STARTED
TO UNDERSTAND

14:39.246 --> 14:42.983
A LOT ABOUT...
YOURSELF.

14:44.417 --> 14:46.186
AND ABOUT YOU.

14:47.087 --> 14:49.389
AND ABOUT ME.

14:52.792 --> 14:54.094
YEAH, IN MY
HEART OF HEARTS,

14:54.194 --> 14:56.930
I REALLY DID NOT
WANT TO COME HERE,

14:57.030 --> 14:59.099
BUT I REALIZED
THAT I WAS WILLING

14:59.199 --> 15:01.068
TO DO WHATEVER IT TOOK

15:01.168 --> 15:05.038
BECAUSE I CANNOT
GET THROUGH TO YOU AT HOME.

15:05.138 --> 15:07.607
AND I THOUGHT,
AT LEAST

15:07.707 --> 15:09.909
IN THIS SETTING,

15:10.010 --> 15:12.179
YOU MIGHT JUST HAVE
TO LISTEN TO ME.

15:12.279 --> 15:13.813
SO YOU DIDN'T
WANT TO COME HERE,

15:13.913 --> 15:15.648
BUT YOU THOUGHT
THIS WAS A PLACE

15:15.748 --> 15:19.319
YOU MIGHT GET ME
TO LISTEN.

15:19.419 --> 15:20.753
YEAH?

15:20.853 --> 15:22.555
YEAH.

15:22.655 --> 15:25.058
BUT HAVING GINA HERE

15:25.158 --> 15:29.096
HAS HELPED ME TO REALIZE
THAT MANY OF MY FEELINGS...

15:30.330 --> 15:32.932
ARE IN FACT
LEGITIMATE.

15:35.802 --> 15:38.038
SO YOU THINK THAT
HAVING GINA HERE

15:38.138 --> 15:40.573
TO LISTEN
TO US SQUABBLE--

15:40.673 --> 15:42.309
PAUL.

15:45.145 --> 15:46.879
BEING HERE WITH GINA

15:46.980 --> 15:49.716
HELPS YOU REALIZE

15:49.816 --> 15:53.286
THAT YOUR FEELINGS
ARE... LEGITIMATE.

15:54.021 --> 15:55.989
YEAH.

15:57.224 --> 16:00.693
AND I ALSO HAVE
BEGUN TO UNDERSTAND

16:00.793 --> 16:02.529
THAT MY...

16:05.598 --> 16:07.467
INVOLVEMENT
WITH EDWARD

16:07.567 --> 16:11.038
WAS MOST LIKELY

16:11.138 --> 16:14.041
SOME KIND OF REACTION

16:14.141 --> 16:16.476
TO THINGS I'VE BEEN
CARRYING WITH ME

16:16.576 --> 16:18.645
FOR MANY MANY YEARS.

16:21.181 --> 16:23.816
YOU THINK THAT CHEATING
ON ME WITH EDWARD

16:23.916 --> 16:25.885
WAS A REACTION
TO SOMETHING FROM
YOUR CHILDHOOD?

16:25.985 --> 16:28.188
NO. PAUL, COME ON.

16:31.891 --> 16:33.826
OKAY.

16:33.926 --> 16:38.165
YOUR RELATIONSHIP...

16:39.699 --> 16:40.967
WITH EDWARD

16:41.068 --> 16:43.603
WAS A REACTION

16:43.703 --> 16:47.274
TO SOMETHING THAT
YOU'VE BEEN CARRYING
AROUND FOR YEARS?

16:47.374 --> 16:48.775
YEAH?

16:48.875 --> 16:51.244
YEAH.

16:51.344 --> 16:53.012
A REACTION TO WHAT,
EXACTLY?

16:53.113 --> 16:55.415
DON'T ASK QUESTIONS.
JUST LISTEN TO HER.

16:55.515 --> 16:58.685
IMAGO. JESUS CHRIST, GINA.
WHAT'S HAPPENED TO YOU?

16:58.785 --> 17:00.987
OKAY. OKAY.

17:01.088 --> 17:03.423
WHAT ELSE?

17:03.523 --> 17:07.527
I THINK GINA'S
ALSO RIGHT THAT...

17:10.863 --> 17:12.832
YOUR THING WITH LAURA,

17:12.932 --> 17:15.668
THAT'S, UM...

17:15.768 --> 17:18.738
THAT'S A REACTION
TO THINGS THAT YOU'VE
BEEN CARRYING AROUND.

17:22.475 --> 17:24.111
PAUL.

17:27.280 --> 17:28.815
Kate:
CAN I...?

17:33.420 --> 17:36.089
WHAT I'M TRYING
TO SAY IS THAT

17:37.190 --> 17:40.893
I GET THAT IT'S
NOT ALL YOUR FAULT.

17:40.993 --> 17:44.631
I GET THAT I HAVE
DONE MY PART.

17:46.399 --> 17:48.301
AND, YOU KNOW,
I'VE BEEN SO BUSY

17:48.401 --> 17:51.938
TRYING TO BE
ALWAYS YOUR GIRLFRIEND,

17:52.038 --> 17:53.740
YOUR WIFE, THE MOTHER...

17:53.840 --> 17:58.077
AND I'VE NEVER...

17:58.778 --> 18:01.214
( sighs )

18:04.317 --> 18:07.987
THAT I JUST NEVER
ALLOWED MYSELF

18:08.087 --> 18:11.090
TO BE KATE, REALLY.

18:11.191 --> 18:13.626
AND HOW CAN THAT
POSSIBLY BE YOUR FAULT?

18:18.431 --> 18:20.733
SO WHAT YOU'RE
SAYING IS

18:20.833 --> 18:23.136
THAT YOU LET YOURSELF
GET LOCKED INTO A KIND OF--

18:24.671 --> 18:27.674
I DON'T KNOW--
DEPENDENT, MATERNAL ROLE?

18:29.342 --> 18:31.211
IT'S JUST HOW
I SAW MYSELF, REALLY.

18:31.311 --> 18:32.912
I NEVER QUESTIONED IT.

18:33.012 --> 18:36.149
YOU KNOW,
ALL THIS CARETAKING

18:36.249 --> 18:38.651
AND PLEASING
OTHER PEOPLE, IT'S...

18:38.751 --> 18:42.054
YOU KNOW, ONLY
FEELING SAFE AS
ONE-HALF OF SOMETHING.

18:42.155 --> 18:45.692
AND EVEN LOOKING
AT THE GAS BILL--
"MRS. DR. PAUL WESTON."

18:50.630 --> 18:52.665
I GUESS IT NEVER
EVEN OCCURRED TO ME

18:52.765 --> 18:54.934
THAT I HAD THE STRENGTH
TO DO THINGS ON MY OWN.

18:55.034 --> 18:59.272
BUT KATE,
YOU RUN A SHELTER
FOR BATTERED WOMEN.

18:59.372 --> 19:03.009
YOU WORK
WITH CODEPENDENTS,
ALCOHOLICS, KIDS AT RISK.

19:03.109 --> 19:05.812
YOUR WORK HAS
SUCH A POSITIVE EFFECT

19:05.912 --> 19:08.515
ON SO MANY
PEOPLE'S LIVES.

19:12.018 --> 19:14.187
BUT THAT'S...

19:17.790 --> 19:18.958
PAUL?

19:19.058 --> 19:20.893
COULD YOU REFLECT?

19:26.666 --> 19:29.236
YOU FEEL THAT
YOU'RE STUCK IN A...

19:31.003 --> 19:33.373
A MOTHERING ROLE,
THAT YOU HAVE--

19:33.473 --> 19:35.308
MAYBE BECAUSE
YOU'RE MARRIED TO ME--

19:35.408 --> 19:37.377
DEPRIVED YOURSELF

19:37.477 --> 19:39.812
OF A FULL, ROUNDED LIFE.

19:40.747 --> 19:42.582
USE HER OWN WORDS.

19:46.185 --> 19:48.421
I LIKE
WHAT HE JUST SAID.

19:54.527 --> 19:56.463
I HAVE...

19:59.466 --> 20:02.269
I HAVE DEPRIVED MYSELF

20:02.369 --> 20:05.538
OF A WELL-ROUNDED LIFE.

20:05.638 --> 20:08.341
BUT IT'S NOT BECAUSE
I'VE BEEN MARRIED TO YOU.

20:09.476 --> 20:11.378
( breathes deeply )

20:16.483 --> 20:18.651
KATE, ARE YOU OKAY?

20:19.886 --> 20:21.421
YEAH.

20:22.655 --> 20:23.956
MM-HMM.

20:28.495 --> 20:30.630
DO WE SWITCH AROUND NOW?

20:32.131 --> 20:33.700
YEAH.

20:35.702 --> 20:36.969
OKAY.

20:41.073 --> 20:44.110
I WANT TO SAY

20:44.210 --> 20:46.613
THAT I WAS LISTENING
TO YOU.

20:46.713 --> 20:48.681
AND THAT, UM...

20:51.851 --> 20:54.120
I HEAR YOU.

20:54.220 --> 20:56.523
IT HURTS ME
TO REALIZE

20:56.623 --> 20:58.625
THAT I'VE BEEN
MARRIED TO YOU
FOR ALL THIS TIME

20:58.725 --> 21:01.260
AND I DIDN'T KNOW
THAT YOU FELT THIS WAY.

21:01.361 --> 21:04.230
I SHOULD HAVE.

21:04.331 --> 21:07.367
AND I'M ANGRY

21:07.467 --> 21:09.669
AT MYSELF FOR THAT.

21:21.113 --> 21:24.884
I HEAR YOU SAYING
THAT YOU DIDN'T KNOW
THAT I FELT THIS WAY.

21:25.718 --> 21:27.053
OKAY?

21:27.153 --> 21:28.555
YEAH.

21:32.992 --> 21:34.594
I'M SCARED.

21:38.398 --> 21:39.799
I'M FRIGHTENED.

21:39.899 --> 21:41.668
( chuckles )

21:41.768 --> 21:44.070
I'VE HAD SO MANY
PATIENTS WHO WERE
IN THIS SITUATION,

21:44.170 --> 21:46.072
IT'S ALMOST LIKE...

21:47.840 --> 21:51.478
IT'S LIKE DEJA VU.

21:53.279 --> 21:56.516
AND WHERE THESE
COUPLES END UP,

21:56.616 --> 21:59.586
WITH ONE PERSON LEAVING
TO FIND THEMSELVES...

22:07.093 --> 22:10.329
I HEAR YOU SAYING

22:10.430 --> 22:12.399
THAT YOU'RE AFRAID
THAT I'LL LEAVE YOU.

22:12.499 --> 22:15.101
NO, I DIDN'T SAY...

22:15.201 --> 22:17.036
"LEAVE ME."

22:17.136 --> 22:18.871
IS THAT
WHAT YOU WANT?

22:34.253 --> 22:36.122
GINA, YOU SAID...

22:36.222 --> 22:38.925
( chuckles )
THAT I MIGHT'VE PUSHED...

22:41.193 --> 22:45.197
KATE INTO HER...
AFFAIR

22:45.297 --> 22:50.369
BECAUSE OF MY...
FEELINGS FOR LAURA.

22:51.438 --> 22:53.339
MAYBE IT'S
THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

22:53.440 --> 22:56.576
MY FEELINGS
FOR LAURA WERE...

22:58.144 --> 22:59.946
THE REACTION

23:01.280 --> 23:04.050
TO WHAT KATE'S
BEEN GOING THROUGH

23:04.150 --> 23:05.652
HERSELF.

23:06.919 --> 23:10.790
WELL, YOU'RE BOTH
GOING THROUGH SOMETHING.

23:10.890 --> 23:12.759
SHE'S STRUGGLING
WITH A DYNAMIC

23:12.859 --> 23:15.094
THAT EXISTED
BEFORE YOU MET:

23:15.194 --> 23:18.498
TO CATER TO OTHERS,

23:18.598 --> 23:21.468
TO PLEASE,
TO ADAPT TO OTHERS.

23:21.568 --> 23:25.337
AND YOUR PAST
INFORMS THE WAY, UH...

23:25.438 --> 23:27.640
YOU ACT WITH LAURA.

23:27.740 --> 23:30.342
YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR THAT YOUNGER WOMAN

23:30.443 --> 23:32.979
THAT YOU CAN NURTURE,
WHO LOOKS UP TO YOU

23:33.079 --> 23:35.047
THE WAY KATE USED TO.

23:43.189 --> 23:46.659
BUT THAT ALSO MAKES YOU
CONFRONT THE SITUATION
WITH YOUR FATHER,

23:46.759 --> 23:49.328
WHICH IS FRIGHTENING.

23:49.428 --> 23:51.030
YOU WERE 14
WHEN HE LEFT?

23:51.130 --> 23:53.733
- 15.
- 15.

23:53.833 --> 23:56.703
YOUR MOTHER HAD
A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN.

23:56.803 --> 23:58.971
YOU HAD TO
TAKE CARE OF HER.

23:59.071 --> 24:01.908
SHE WAS GIVING YOU
NOTHING IN RETURN.

24:02.008 --> 24:04.877
MAYBE YOU WERE TRYING
TO ADDRESS THAT

24:04.977 --> 24:06.613
IN YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH KATE--

24:06.713 --> 24:08.881
LOOKING FOR
THE MOTHERING

24:08.981 --> 24:11.450
THAT YOU DIDN'T GET.

24:11.551 --> 24:14.587
AT THE SAME TIME,

24:14.687 --> 24:16.589
YOU NEED
TO PROTECT YOURSELF

24:16.689 --> 24:19.125
FROM NEEDING IT
SO MUCH

24:19.225 --> 24:22.762
BECAUSE THERE'S ALWAYS
THE RISK OF LOSING IT.

24:22.862 --> 24:27.567
AND SO YOU PULL AWAY,
YOU BURY YOURSELF
IN YOUR WORK.

24:27.667 --> 24:29.869
YOU WANT KATE THERE,
YOU ALWAYS WANT HER THERE

24:29.969 --> 24:32.138
BUT YOU WANT HER
AT ARM'S LENGTH.

24:35.508 --> 24:38.545
SO, MAYBE...

24:38.645 --> 24:40.880
NOW WE HAVE
SOME IDEA...

24:42.682 --> 24:44.784
OF WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING
BETWEEN YOU

24:44.884 --> 24:46.786
AND MAYBE NOW
WE CAN JUST BEGIN

24:46.886 --> 24:50.122
TO STEER THE SHIP
BACK ON COURSE?

24:53.626 --> 24:55.127
I DON'T KNOW.

24:55.227 --> 24:58.665
- MM-HMM.
- Kate: I HONESTLY
DON'T KNOW.

24:58.765 --> 25:01.133
I JUST FEEL THAT...

25:02.869 --> 25:06.505
WE'VE BEEN GOING
IN THE SAME DIRECTION
FOR SO LONG,

25:08.340 --> 25:11.811
MAYBE THE BEST THING
WOULD BE FOR ME TO JUST
GET OFF THE SHIP.

25:15.815 --> 25:17.750
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

25:19.151 --> 25:21.821
ARE YOU SAYING THAT
YOU WANT TO LEAVE?

25:25.391 --> 25:27.259
I'M NOT SURE, PAUL.

25:37.069 --> 25:39.639
YEAH, I JUST
WANT TO SAY--

25:39.739 --> 25:43.109
AND I DON'T MEAN THIS
IN A PATRONIZING WAY,

25:43.209 --> 25:46.579
BUT IT'S NOT UNCOMMON

25:46.679 --> 25:50.683
FOR COUPLES YOUR AGE
TO BE AT THIS CROSSROADS.

25:50.783 --> 25:52.752
THAT DOESN'T MEAN
THAT WHAT YOU'RE
GOING THROUGH

25:52.852 --> 25:56.923
ISN'T COMPLICATED
AND PAINFUL.

25:57.023 --> 26:00.292
AND, LIKE PAUL SAID,
IT DOES SOMETIMES END

26:00.392 --> 26:03.663
WITH SOMEONE LEAVING.

26:04.797 --> 26:07.834
BUT NO ONE HAS
LEFT HERE YET.

26:07.934 --> 26:10.236
AND, THOUGH IT MAY
NOT SEEM SO

26:10.336 --> 26:12.639
RIGHT NOW
AT THIS MOMENT,

26:12.739 --> 26:16.643
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY'S
QUITE READY TO LEAVE.

26:26.653 --> 26:28.487
OKAY, WELL,

26:28.587 --> 26:32.358
GIVE ME A CALL,

26:32.458 --> 26:34.794
AND LET ME KNOW
ABOUT NEXT FRIDAY.

26:36.395 --> 26:37.697
OKAY.

26:41.100 --> 26:42.902
THANKS, GINA.

26:53.379 --> 26:55.848
( cell phone buzzing )

26:58.718 --> 27:00.152
Gina:
BYE, DEAR.

27:04.456 --> 27:06.458
HELLO?

27:06.558 --> 27:08.895
YES, THIS IS HE.

27:12.064 --> 27:13.666
MM-HMM.

27:21.741 --> 27:24.276
( soft piano music
playing )
