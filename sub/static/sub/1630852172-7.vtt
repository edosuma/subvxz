- You can just leave it,

- What are you doing here?

04:56.295 --> 04:58.423
I thought you were doing
that Mike Leigh?

04:58.506 --> 05:03.261
No, that got intense. Yeah.
So, he rents me this tiny flat,

05:03.344 --> 05:06.723
makes me live in it
so I can get into character,

05:06.806 --> 05:08.725
then I find out
there is no movie

05:08.808 --> 05:10.351
- and he is just into me.

05:10.435 --> 05:11.394
Can you imagine?

05:11.477 --> 05:13.396
He's old enough to be
my first boyfriend, darling.

05:13.479 --> 05:15.857
Oh. Oh!

05:18.568 --> 05:21.070
This is Michael Caine,
your new baby brother.

05:21.154 --> 05:23.406
Careful, he pees
when he's excited.

05:23.489 --> 05:25.408
He's just like me
when I was pregnant with you.

05:25.491 --> 05:29.078

I was pissing everywhere.

05:29.162 --> 05:32.123

05:33.875 --> 05:35.084
Giddy, you invited me.

05:35.168 --> 05:36.586
But then I left you a voicemail.

05:36.669 --> 05:38.129
Darling, the only people
who leave voicemails

05:38.212 --> 05:40.339
are assistants
and David O. Russell.

05:40.423 --> 05:42.759
And I'm keeping those in case
I'm ever deposed.

05:42.842 --> 05:45.762
Also, this-- oh, this. Yeah.

05:45.845 --> 05:47.597
There was an actual stampede
at the Chiltern

05:47.680 --> 05:52.185
when I met Paul Mescal.
Or I should say, Paul Mescaline.

05:52.268 --> 05:56.314
That man's beauty,
literally hallucinogenic.

05:57.523 --> 05:59.942
Oh, I do hope I've arrived

06:00.026 --> 06:01.486
Where's Roy-Roy?

06:01.569 --> 06:04.530
I've got these illicit photos
of Jude and Phillipa's garden
he asked for.

06:04.614 --> 06:06.783
Darling, have you come
from a spin class

06:06.866 --> 06:08.242
- or--
- Roy...

06:09.702 --> 06:10.787
moved out.

06:10.870 --> 06:14.457
What? No!

06:14.540 --> 06:18.336
Oh, darling, you must tell me
all about it right now.

06:18.419 --> 06:20.797
Also, please let's use
my cream rinse.

06:20.880 --> 06:22.381
It's from Hershesons.
This is just...

06:28.888 --> 06:30.515
Anybody could see us here.

06:30.598 --> 06:32.517
It's Le Pain.
We're good.

06:32.600 --> 06:33.976
This close to school?

06:34.060 --> 06:36.395
We're having breakfast together,
Obie. Big deal.

06:36.479 --> 06:38.314
- We're friends.
- No, friends do not do

06:38.397 --> 06:40.024
what we did, all right?
I don't--

06:40.108 --> 06:41.567
I've felt sick all weekend.

06:43.611 --> 06:45.822
So have I.
She hasn't messaged me back.

06:45.905 --> 06:47.949
Yeah, no.
She hasn't been answering
my calls.

06:48.032 --> 06:50.743
We're terrible people.

06:52.078 --> 06:53.871
We're not.

06:53.955 --> 06:58.292
Sometimes good people
do bad things and don't realize

06:58.376 --> 07:00.878
until it's too late.
And now they have to pretend

07:00.962 --> 07:02.547
that those bad things
never happened.

07:02.630 --> 07:04.048
I mean, you think maybe
that she can, you know, that--

07:04.132 --> 07:06.092
that she'll understand?

07:06.759 --> 07:08.845
I can't lose her, Obie.

07:08.928 --> 07:10.972
What happened was just a moment.
That's it.

07:11.055 --> 07:13.391
It wasn't real.
It's just an echo.

07:23.776 --> 07:25.319
I should've--
I should have never...

07:26.612 --> 07:26.654
We...

07:28.281 --> 07:29.407
should have never.

07:32.118 --> 07:33.995
What are we gonna do when we--
when we see her? I mean--

07:34.078 --> 07:35.788
We looked for her.
We couldn't find her.

07:35.872 --> 07:36.581
We tried to contact her
all weekend.

07:38.958 --> 07:42.211
But we should keep our distance,
starting now.

07:43.254 --> 07:44.505
I'll take Fifth.
You take Madison.

07:54.390 --> 07:56.392
Why did Dan Humphrey always give
himself Thanksgiving off?

07:56.475 --> 07:59.520
It's one of the juiciest days
of the year.

07:59.604 --> 08:02.607
A, don't ever say "juicy" again,
and B, he probably went insane

08:02.690 --> 08:04.483
writing all those posts
about himself.

08:04.567 --> 08:07.570
This thing is all-consuming,
and I barely do anything.

08:07.653 --> 08:10.489
Which is why I never take
days off, especially now.

08:10.573 --> 08:12.074
You can refresh it all you want.

08:12.158 --> 08:14.202
Once media's deleted, it's gone.

08:14.285 --> 08:15.286
- But does he know we saw it?
- We share the account.

08:15.369 --> 08:16.746
There's no way he'd know
who saw it,

08:16.829 --> 08:20.208
- unless you told him you did.
- Well, we should tell someone.

08:20.291 --> 08:21.792
He slept with a student.
That's--

08:21.876 --> 08:24.420
Morally reprehensible,
yes, but not illegal.

08:24.503 --> 08:27.757
Max is 17. I checked.
It's the age of consent.

08:27.840 --> 08:29.634
But Rafa would still get fired.

08:29.717 --> 08:31.427
It definitely crosses a line,

08:31.510 --> 08:35.556
but there's more
of an age difference
between you and Nick Lott.

08:35.640 --> 08:37.266
Max Wolfe sent us that video.

08:37.350 --> 08:40.102
He wanted Gossip Girl
to post it.

08:40.186 --> 08:42.605
I mean, for all we know,
Rafa ghosted him

08:42.688 --> 08:46.442
- and it's revenge porn.
- I miss revenge porn.

08:46.525 --> 08:49.111
We need to find out
if Rafa knows we know.

08:49.195 --> 08:51.530
And if he doesn't,
we need to decide

08:51.614 --> 08:54.408
- what to do about it.
- Nothing. We have no proof.

09:07.838 --> 09:09.340
Your hair, it's cool.

09:09.423 --> 09:11.676
Thanks.
I am trying something new.

09:13.761 --> 09:16.472
- Uh, as are you, apparently?
- New things can be cool, right?

09:18.766 --> 09:22.728
Yeah, but, um,
they can also be weird.

09:22.812 --> 09:26.983
- Are you talking about--
- What? No. Why? Are you?

09:27.066 --> 09:28.693
- You are.
<i>-Buongiorno, amanti.</i>

09:28.776 --> 09:31.487
I was wondering when
I was gonna see you both again.

09:31.570 --> 09:32.530
- Why are you so happy?
- Well, my birth mom,

09:32.613 --> 09:35.491
she is in town
helping my dad feel better,

09:35.574 --> 09:36.993
which allowed me to remember

09:37.076 --> 09:39.954
how we all made each other
feel better.

09:40.037 --> 09:40.997
What have you guys
been up to, huh?

09:41.080 --> 09:43.207
I've just been at the hospital
all weekend, and...

09:43.291 --> 09:45.918
Full Tarkovsky MO, me.

09:47.044 --> 09:48.379
Wait, you haven't
seen each other?

09:49.588 --> 09:52.883
I think we saw enough
of each other that night.

09:52.967 --> 09:55.261
Oh, okay. I--
I see what's happening.

09:55.344 --> 09:56.512
Okay. Well, look.

09:56.596 --> 09:59.181
Side effects of having
your first threesome

09:59.265 --> 10:02.101
may include feelings of regret
or shame, or...

10:03.477 --> 10:05.021
the intense desire
to wanna do it all over again.

10:05.104 --> 10:06.605
That-- that one's me.

10:06.689 --> 10:09.525
I think I'm gonna be late
for Mandarin.

10:10.276 --> 10:11.485
Hey.

10:14.363 --> 10:16.032
I've dealt with this before,
okay?

10:16.115 --> 10:18.492
You have each witnessed
your partner with someone else.

10:18.576 --> 10:20.995
The weirdness is understandable.
But it is important

10:21.078 --> 10:22.371
that you guys go
and fuck each other...

10:22.455 --> 10:24.373
-...as soon as possible

10:24.457 --> 10:26.542
to reclaim
that connection, okay?

10:26.625 --> 10:29.337
The first sex
after a threesome,

10:29.420 --> 10:32.006
it is-- it's--
it's indescribable. Okay?

10:32.089 --> 10:35.134
So I suggest
that you skip out first period,

10:35.217 --> 10:37.345
and then slip into me third?

10:43.476 --> 10:45.686
I mean, I'd be into it.
I just keep thinking

10:45.770 --> 10:47.772
about that time you guys
kind of left me out.

10:47.855 --> 10:52.526
I keep seeing that time
that you two were very much in.

10:54.779 --> 10:55.654
- I'll see you at lunch.
- Uh...

11:00.951 --> 11:02.411
Hey, man. Did you get my text?

11:02.495 --> 11:06.332
Uh, yeah. I was...
I was busy with, um...

11:06.415 --> 11:08.626
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm-- Yeah, I'm all good.

11:08.709 --> 11:10.878
Well, are we still on
for tomorrow?

11:10.961 --> 11:12.838
Our annual anti-Thanksgiving?

11:12.922 --> 11:14.548
Me, you, and Jodi
for a double feature

11:14.632 --> 11:15.758
- at Film Forum?
- I got-- I have plans.

11:17.676 --> 11:19.553
Is everything okay?
Like, you can tell me.

11:19.637 --> 11:21.889
Yeah, well, you can tell me
anything too,

11:21.972 --> 11:23.432
but it doesn't mean that you do.

11:23.974 --> 11:25.434
Is this about me?

11:25.518 --> 11:28.062
- Look, I-- I gotta go, man.
Obie!

11:29.021 --> 11:31.107
Hey, Z.

11:31.190 --> 11:32.692
Julien should hear this too.
Jules!

11:36.862 --> 11:37.697
Hi.

11:38.948 --> 11:41.450
So, I'm guessing you both know
what this is about?

11:42.368 --> 11:44.453
Uh...

11:44.537 --> 11:45.788
Thanksgiving.
My dad was hoping you'd join us.

11:48.207 --> 11:49.625
- Who?
- Both of you.

11:49.708 --> 11:51.961
I assume you usually
spend it together,

11:52.044 --> 11:53.629
and now that we're all cool,

11:53.712 --> 11:55.631
I figured
it wouldn't hurt to ask.

11:55.714 --> 11:57.174
In Buffalo, we had
an open-door policy,

11:57.258 --> 11:58.843
so I'm gonna invite everyone.

11:58.926 --> 12:00.845
- Uh...
- That is so nice,

12:00.928 --> 12:04.223
but um, my dad and I have
this stay-at-home tradition,

12:04.306 --> 12:05.516
so I wouldn't want
to disappoint him.

12:05.599 --> 12:06.892
- And-- and you and Aki
just hang out.
- Yeah.

12:06.976 --> 12:08.978
- They don't like
to celebrate, so...
- Yeah. We commemorate the, uh,

12:09.061 --> 12:11.147
the National Day of Mourning,
actually, so...

12:11.230 --> 12:13.649

12:18.404 --> 12:20.156
Really glad to see you, though.
I tried you all weekend.

Um, I know. Um...

12:22.658 --> 12:25.327
I don't know.
I just thought maybe...

12:25.411 --> 12:27.413
Thought what?
I mean, I-- I wanted to see you.

12:27.496 --> 12:29.165
I missed you.

12:29.248 --> 12:31.292
Maybe we can hang out
after school and, uh,

12:32.126 --> 12:33.294
make up for lost time.

12:35.421 --> 12:37.756
- Yes, please.
- All right.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.638
Why do I do this to myself?

12:44.722 --> 12:46.015
Do what? Give me a hint.

12:46.098 --> 12:47.933
Is it the shoes?
Is it the clothes?

12:48.017 --> 12:49.977
- I'm kidding. I'm kidding.
- Ha, ha, ha.

12:50.060 --> 12:51.687
I don't know.
I've just been letting my mind
play tricks on me.

12:54.440 --> 12:56.734
You shouldn't.
It's never what you think it is.

12:58.402 --> 13:00.362
- You're probably right.
- Lunch later?

13:01.197 --> 13:02.364
- Sounds good.
- Okay.

13:09.872 --> 13:11.040
Ms. Keller!

13:11.123 --> 13:12.208
Hi. What are you doing
for Thanksgiving?

13:12.291 --> 13:15.377
Um, my dad and I do this thing
where we invite everybody

13:15.461 --> 13:17.338
who has no place to go.
It's pretty amazing.

13:17.421 --> 13:19.173
It usually turns
into a little salon, and--

13:19.256 --> 13:21.383
That's super kind, but, um,
have you run it by your dad?

13:21.467 --> 13:23.802
Yeah. It was his idea.

13:23.886 --> 13:25.888
- Inviting me specifically?
Mm-hmm.

13:27.515 --> 13:30.726
While I appreciate the offer,
I do have plans. Thanks, though.

13:32.269 --> 13:34.063
Hey, Z. What's wrong?

13:34.146 --> 13:36.524
I'm just trying to scrounge up
some people for Thanksgiving.

13:36.607 --> 13:37.566
So far no takers.
I'd invite you,

13:37.650 --> 13:40.027
but I know you have plans
with Obie.

13:40.110 --> 13:41.237
Well, apparently not this year.

13:42.905 --> 13:44.323
Yeah. It confused me too.

13:47.326 --> 13:49.411
Thanks for the invite.

13:58.837 --> 14:01.966
You definitely are never getting
recruited for Quantico.

14:02.049 --> 14:03.467
This is a teacher's lounge.
We're all teachers.

14:03.551 --> 14:05.844
And we're gonna stay that way.

14:10.349 --> 14:12.017
- I know you saw it.
- Saw what?

14:12.101 --> 14:14.728
- You know what "it" is.
- That deepfake?

14:15.563 --> 14:17.940
- It's real.
- I knew it was real.

14:18.023 --> 14:19.984
Also, what's your workout plan?
'Cause--

14:20.067 --> 14:23.445
- A student? How could you?
- I know it was wrong, okay?

14:25.072 --> 14:26.448
He pursued me.
He followed me after work.

14:26.532 --> 14:28.117
I tried to hold off. I did.

14:28.200 --> 14:31.870
You expect us to believe
a student was
the aggressor here?

14:31.954 --> 14:33.497
We-- we are talking about Max.

14:33.581 --> 14:35.249
I don't have to
explain myself to you.

14:35.332 --> 14:37.918
You're a teacher.
You're supposed to know better.

14:38.002 --> 14:41.171
And even if you deleted it,
that video still exists.

14:41.255 --> 14:43.465
It's only a matter of time
before he shows it

14:43.549 --> 14:45.509
to someone else.
He already DMed

14:45.593 --> 14:47.219
asking why we haven't posted it.

14:47.303 --> 14:49.763
He's not gonna show it
to anyone else.

14:49.847 --> 14:52.266
- And neither are you.
- You don't call the shots here.

14:52.349 --> 14:54.143
On the contrary,
I changed the password

14:54.226 --> 14:56.228
and logged you out the minute
you walked in this room.

14:59.148 --> 15:00.899
- What the fuck are you--
- Doing? Protecting myself.

15:03.402 --> 15:05.154
I made a mistake,
but I can't lose

15:05.237 --> 15:08.365
my entire career because of it.
I didn't take advantage of him.

15:08.449 --> 15:10.200
I didn't abuse
my position of power.

15:10.284 --> 15:11.493
It wasn't even illegal.

15:13.746 --> 15:15.122
But it will still destroy me.

15:15.205 --> 15:17.750
You can't keep this
from us forever.

15:17.833 --> 15:20.044
Do you think I'm interested
in your shitty teen tabloid?

15:20.127 --> 15:21.503
I'm holding it ransom.

15:21.587 --> 15:23.547
I figure three months of digging
through people's trash

15:23.631 --> 15:24.882
has made you
pretty good detectives.

15:24.965 --> 15:26.508
Excavate whatever you can
on Max

15:26.592 --> 15:28.052
so that if he ever tries
anything again...

15:28.135 --> 15:31.889
- I can take him out first.
- But it's Thanksgiving.

15:31.972 --> 15:32.598
And when you bring me
what you find,

15:32.681 --> 15:34.683
I'll prove how thankful I am

15:34.767 --> 15:35.809
by giving you back
what you want.

15:35.893 --> 15:38.228

Obie feels like you've been
pulling away from him.

Yeah. That's why he's been
acting so weird, and he just--

17:12.114 --> 17:14.241

how you feel about him anymore.

17:14.324 --> 17:15.784
- Really?
- Really.

You know him. Whenever he feels
unsure about something,

17:21.331 --> 17:23.459
he just completely shuts down.

17:23.542 --> 17:26.795
Major character flaw.
But if you still feel about him

17:26.879 --> 17:28.839
the way that I think
that you do, just reassure him

17:28.922 --> 17:31.425

You never stopped loving him, J.
And if there is a chance

18:00.579 --> 18:01.663

was gonna find out,

18:04.917 --> 18:06.794

she was taking a day off,

Well, if you really
don't want him back, then...

18:46.416 --> 18:48.001
Why do you keep on looking
at me like that?

18:48.085 --> 18:50.796
It's either eye contact
with you or Jesus,

18:50.879 --> 18:52.965
and He does not seem into this.

18:53.048 --> 18:54.216
Just close your eyes, babe.

18:56.885 --> 19:00.097
Ow! Okay. Look. Look.

19:00.180 --> 19:02.391
Let's just try it like this.
You like it like this, right?

19:02.474 --> 19:05.060
Right? Come on. Come on.

19:07.646 --> 19:09.815
Okay. You're not--
you're not hard, babe.

19:11.191 --> 19:13.360
I just keep thinking about
when you were doing that thing,

19:13.443 --> 19:15.028
and I was over there.

19:15.112 --> 19:16.947
I just keep on thinking about
when you were doing that thing

19:17.030 --> 19:18.574
and I was under there, okay?

19:18.657 --> 19:20.242
Like, I've never seen
your face like that before.

19:20.325 --> 19:21.410
'Cause your eyes were closed.

19:21.493 --> 19:22.286
Well, I couldn't close them
then, could I?

19:27.833 --> 19:29.710
Max said we had to do this.

19:29.793 --> 19:32.087
Well,
then he should tell us how.

19:32.170 --> 19:32.921
The whole point is that
we're supposed to do it alone

19:33.005 --> 19:35.924
before we can do it
with him again.

19:36.008 --> 19:36.800
So let's just suck it up
and get it over with,

19:36.884 --> 19:39.261
so we can both get what we want.

19:51.231 --> 19:53.609
We were not supposed to do that.

19:53.692 --> 19:54.818
- You texted me.

19:54.902 --> 19:57.946
- We needed intervention.

19:58.947 --> 20:00.908
We gotta clean that up
before stained glass

20:00.991 --> 20:02.409
takes on a whole new meaning.

20:03.869 --> 20:07.122
- This is not fair.

20:07.205 --> 20:07.956
- I feel icky looking at him

20:08.040 --> 20:10.250
without you in the frame
as well.

20:10.334 --> 20:13.795
Consider me
cropped out then, okay?

20:13.879 --> 20:16.548
If you will not voluntarily
heed my advice,

20:16.632 --> 20:18.717
then I am just gonna have
to enforce it.

20:18.800 --> 20:20.385
You're gonna celebrate
away from each other,

20:20.469 --> 20:21.720
then you're gonna get
a hotel room,

20:21.803 --> 20:22.763
you're gonna lock the door,

20:22.846 --> 20:25.140
you're gonna remember
what I did to each of you,

20:25.223 --> 20:25.849
and then you're gonna get at it.

20:25.933 --> 20:29.686
Only then can you call me back.

that sentence.

If Gossip Girl doesn't give him
what he wants,

21:46.221 --> 21:47.556
he may try and get it elsewhere.

21:47.639 --> 21:49.099
What can we do?
School just ended.

21:49.182 --> 21:50.517
We haven't even started to dig.

21:50.600 --> 21:52.519
I'm gonna do
what any good negotiator does.

21:53.645 --> 21:54.813
Give you a clock.

21:54.896 --> 21:57.858
<i>I know I've promised
a quiet Thanksgiving,</i>

21:57.941 --> 21:59.568
<i>but a girl's work is never done.</i>

22:00.652 --> 22:02.237
<i>And once you see
what I'm bringing to dinner,</i>

22:02.320 --> 22:05.240
<i>you'll be happy
I didn't stay away for long.</i>

22:06.324 --> 22:09.161
<i>Watch this space
for just desserts.</i>

22:09.244 --> 22:11.830
What happens if we don't get you
what you need by tomorrow night?

22:11.913 --> 22:12.914
Well, Gossip's a girl
of her word.

22:12.998 --> 22:16.001
She has to post something juicy.

22:16.084 --> 22:18.253
So I guess your identity
will have to do.

22:18.336 --> 22:19.546
Let the countdown begin.

22:22.049 --> 22:24.718
How come he gets to say "juicy"?

22:26.803 --> 22:30.098
<i>You know, we're actually
in the very center of the park.</i>

22:30.182 --> 22:31.183
And this-- this whole thing
used to be underwater.

22:31.266 --> 22:33.393
Part of that reservoir
right there that--

22:33.477 --> 22:34.936
Obie, you've been
talking topography

22:35.020 --> 22:36.563
for the last ten minutes.

22:36.646 --> 22:38.273
I know
that you're upset with me.

22:39.524 --> 22:42.235
Just... Why did you lie to me
about your plans with Aki?

22:43.070 --> 22:43.445
He told me you canceled.

22:45.530 --> 22:46.531
No. I-- I just didn't-- No.

22:46.615 --> 22:49.951
I don't wanna see the movies
that he wanted to see.

22:50.035 --> 22:51.912
But that's it. I mean,
I'm still going. I didn't--

22:51.995 --> 22:53.121
I didn't lie.
I wouldn't lie to you.

22:53.205 --> 22:54.206
And I don't wanna lie
to you either,

22:54.289 --> 22:56.291
- so I'm gonna be
totally honest, okay?
- Okay. Go.

22:57.292 --> 22:57.793
I know
that you and Julien were--

22:57.876 --> 22:59.795
Me and Julien what?

23:01.213 --> 23:02.839
Have been together
for a long time,

23:02.923 --> 23:04.216
- and I can't compete with that.
- Yeah.

23:04.299 --> 23:07.135
But I also don't want to be
a rebound.

23:07.219 --> 23:08.845
So if you want
to go back to her--

23:08.929 --> 23:11.389
No.
Of course I don't.

23:12.015 --> 23:13.141
Then what's with us?

23:13.225 --> 23:15.977
You're either distant and cold,
or you're calling me ten times

23:16.061 --> 23:17.479
like you're guilty
about something.

23:17.562 --> 23:18.855
No.

23:20.232 --> 23:22.567
God, no, you have--
look, you've just-- you've--

23:22.651 --> 23:24.444
you've totally misread
this entire thing.

23:24.528 --> 23:27.239
- I have?
- Yeah. I...

23:28.782 --> 23:30.158
I'd-- I-- I haven't...

23:31.243 --> 23:33.036
You know, I don't--
I haven't known, how to, uh,

23:33.120 --> 23:36.081
you know... I don't--

23:36.164 --> 23:37.082
Obie, what do you feel
about me, really?

23:37.165 --> 23:39.376
Feel about you? I love you.

23:41.586 --> 23:44.673
- I, uh... what?

23:44.756 --> 23:46.716
I just haven't known
how to say it. I don't...

23:48.552 --> 23:50.762
I love you, Zoya.
I-- I haven't-- I...

24:08.238 --> 24:09.447
I just told your father
his Tillmans C-print

24:09.531 --> 24:11.408
looks digital,
so now he's occupied for a while

24:11.491 --> 24:14.202
- looking for the receipt.

24:14.286 --> 24:16.371
But you're terribly flushed.
Have you been for a run?

24:17.205 --> 24:18.665
How's our operation going?

24:19.791 --> 24:22.335
He's still upset, but I--

24:22.419 --> 24:24.754
I did that thing
that worked with Megs

24:24.838 --> 24:26.590
where you slag off
the other person so much,

24:26.673 --> 24:31.178
they have absolutely no choice
but to start defending them.

24:31.261 --> 24:32.471
You know I got Wills and Harry
talking again, right?

24:32.554 --> 24:35.432
Darling, I should have
fistfuls of Nobels

24:35.515 --> 24:37.684
- for my Saskia Accords by now.
- Mmm.

24:40.145 --> 24:41.813
- Oh!

24:42.314 --> 24:43.815
There you are.

24:44.983 --> 24:46.401
I thought you quit.

24:48.820 --> 24:49.821
These aren't mine.

24:49.905 --> 24:51.281
Okay. So now
I've thawed the ice a bit,

24:51.364 --> 24:53.783
we can let global warming
do the rest.

24:53.867 --> 24:56.786
But we need to engineer
<i>un petit piège des parents.</i>

24:56.870 --> 24:58.705
Well, they haven't been
in the same room with each other

24:58.788 --> 25:02.083
in over a month. Uh...
When Dad thought he saw Pops

25:02.167 --> 25:04.169
- at Gourmet Garage, he fled...

25:04.252 --> 25:06.087
...with the basket.
So now we're not allowed back.

25:06.171 --> 25:07.923
- Oh, no.
I know.

25:08.006 --> 25:09.507
Darling, of course
he can do that in public

25:09.591 --> 25:11.843
'cause he doesn't know anyone.
But put him somewhere

25:11.927 --> 25:14.471
where he is forced to be
on his best behavior...

25:21.770 --> 25:25.315
Not possible. They book
Thanksgiving a year in advance.

25:25.398 --> 25:28.026
Darling, I was in <i>Pericles</i> at
the Public with the maître d',

25:28.109 --> 25:29.110
and he owes a favor

25:29.194 --> 25:32.113
for something I'm not allowed
to talk about till 2026.

25:33.490 --> 25:33.615
So ask me then.

25:36.868 --> 25:39.496
<i>Jules,
I just wanted to apologize.</i>

25:39.579 --> 25:42.666
- Apologize? For what?
- You were right.

25:42.749 --> 25:45.210
I was? Great.
About what?

25:45.293 --> 25:46.628
About Obie.
He told me he loves me.

25:48.129 --> 25:49.548
He what?

25:49.631 --> 25:50.799
<i>Yeah. In Central Park
in front of all these people.</i>

25:50.882 --> 25:53.468
<i>They even started clapping,
which was sort of weird</i>

25:53.551 --> 25:55.512
but also amazing.

25:55.595 --> 25:59.015
- He said he loved you?
- Yeah. Like three times.

25:59.099 --> 26:03.270
- And did you say it back?
- Of course.

26:05.939 --> 26:08.525
Oh... Are you still there?
Did your phone die?

26:09.401 --> 26:11.528
I'm here. It's just...

26:12.779 --> 26:14.739
Obie can rush
into things sometimes,

26:14.823 --> 26:18.868
and I don't want you to think
that everything between you

26:18.952 --> 26:20.662
<i>is suddenly better because--</i>

26:20.745 --> 26:23.164
A few hours ago,
you were rooting for this.

26:23.248 --> 26:24.708
You're the one who told me
to be honest about my feelings.

26:27.085 --> 26:29.963
You didn't think
he'd return them.

26:30.046 --> 26:31.589
- No. That's not--
<i>So you just wanna ruin</i>

26:31.673 --> 26:34.926
the most romantic thing
that's ever happened to me

26:35.010 --> 26:37.345
for no reason? I don't know
what games you're playing,

26:37.429 --> 26:38.847
but whatever it is,
I'm tagging out.

26:41.182 --> 26:43.059
Hey. Who was that on the phone?

26:43.143 --> 26:45.103
Zoya. Dad, I know we always
spend the night before together,

26:45.186 --> 26:46.646
but I have to go.

26:46.730 --> 26:50.608
♪ ("THIS IS ME TRYING"
BY TAYLOR SWIFT PLAYING) ♪

26:53.778 --> 26:57.032
I don't know what I expected.
"Callow" is literally
in her name.

26:57.115 --> 26:58.533
Uh-oh. What happened now?

26:58.616 --> 26:59.367
She's always looking out
for her own interests,

26:59.451 --> 27:02.203
playing games,
manipulating people.

27:02.287 --> 27:04.497
Whatever you said about Davis,
she clearly inherited.

27:04.581 --> 27:06.541
You were right. The Calloways
are not our family.

27:16.217 --> 27:18.720

Jules, what are you doing here?

27:25.226 --> 27:27.687
- You told her you loved her?
- You told me to say that.

27:27.771 --> 27:28.772
I didn't tell you to say that,
Obie. Jesus.

27:28.855 --> 27:31.649
Look, I care for her.
I do, all right? But I don't--

27:32.817 --> 27:34.235
Everything I've been doing,
I've been doing

27:34.319 --> 27:36.780
'cause I don't wanna ruin things
for you, okay? I mean, I...

27:40.325 --> 27:40.742
Look...

27:42.285 --> 27:43.578
I would do anything...

27:43.661 --> 27:46.331
to make you happy.
Anything that you ask me,

27:46.414 --> 27:48.750
because I love you,
and I always have.

27:48.833 --> 27:50.251

Please. Just come upstairs.

28:09.771 --> 28:12.190
- Please. Julien.
- I can't...

28:13.191 --> 28:13.942
- Come upstairs.
- I can't.

28:14.025 --> 28:15.860
Julien.

28:17.028 --> 28:18.822
Shit. Shit. Shit.

28:25.203 --> 28:26.329
<i>We're doing our best.</i>

28:26.413 --> 28:28.623
<i>Please tell me
your "best" isn't staking out</i>

28:28.706 --> 28:30.708
<i>Max's house hoping to catch him
doing something.</i>

28:30.792 --> 28:33.128
We have leads.
Don't worry.

28:33.211 --> 28:35.797
Oh, I have leads too.
Too bad you can't post them.

28:35.880 --> 28:38.425
- Especially this.

28:43.012 --> 28:43.805
When did you get that?

28:43.888 --> 28:46.975
Last night.
It's practically old news.

28:47.058 --> 28:48.977
<i>Will it be useless by the time
you're back in charge,</i>

28:49.060 --> 28:52.730
or will it pale in comparison
to what I write about you? XOXO.

28:55.900 --> 28:58.653
We're not gonna find anything
to take out Max Wolfe.

28:58.736 --> 29:01.030
What hasn't he already done,
and publicly?

29:01.114 --> 29:02.532
Well, if we don't
find dirt on him,

29:02.615 --> 29:03.616
we have to find it on Rafa.

29:03.700 --> 29:08.621
Unless we get a hold
of that video ourselves.

29:08.705 --> 29:11.166
How?
Crash the Wolfe Thanksgiving

29:11.249 --> 29:13.168
and steal Max's phone
to blackmail Rafa

29:13.251 --> 29:14.711
into giving Gossip Girl back?

29:16.421 --> 29:17.797
Of course we're doing that.

29:21.593 --> 29:22.969
I wrangled up some guests.

29:23.052 --> 29:25.555
Oh. At least one of us
has friends.

29:25.638 --> 29:27.682
Chin up, kiddo.
A full table means

29:27.765 --> 29:29.517
double the mac and cheese.

29:29.601 --> 29:31.352
- Care to shred?
- Oh, Dad.

29:31.436 --> 29:32.896
You know
I'm the best cheddar shredder

29:32.979 --> 29:34.564
- in the tri-state area.

29:34.647 --> 29:36.316
I'm glad
you're in a better mood.

29:36.399 --> 29:37.525
Yeah, well,
I woke up today realizing

29:37.609 --> 29:40.904
that I don't have to see Julien
for five whole days, and...

29:41.404 --> 29:43.114
Obie loves me.

29:44.115 --> 29:45.366
Um... he will be here
around 4:00.

29:45.450 --> 29:48.286
Great. I'll set another place.

29:52.457 --> 29:54.959
Jules Dassin at MoMA?
- Seen 'em.

29:57.128 --> 29:59.797
- The new Bi Gan?
- Got a screener.

30:00.757 --> 30:02.383
<i>Muppets Take Manhattan?</i>

30:05.303 --> 30:06.763
Why did Obie cancel?

30:07.430 --> 30:10.058
He made other plans.

30:10.141 --> 30:11.809
Did something happen
between you?

30:12.268 --> 30:14.020
Akeno!

30:16.105 --> 30:17.774
I think we're just...

30:17.857 --> 30:20.235
growing apart from each other
or something? I don't know.

30:20.318 --> 30:21.986
Well, good friends
grow together.

30:24.739 --> 30:27.742
Things just have been weird
since Dad did what he did.

30:29.077 --> 30:30.995
Well, you think
Obie doesn't accept you?

30:31.746 --> 30:32.747
He's your best friend.

30:34.374 --> 30:36.584
I didn't want to say anything

30:36.668 --> 30:39.837
out of respect
to your process...

30:40.838 --> 30:42.590
but I want you to know
I love you.

30:42.674 --> 30:44.509
No matter if you're straight,

30:44.592 --> 30:47.512
- or gay, or--
- I'm bisexual.

30:48.680 --> 30:52.308
I love who you are
without exception.

30:52.392 --> 30:54.310
Your best friend should too.

30:54.394 --> 30:56.646
Friendships are important.
You need to talk to him.

30:56.729 --> 30:59.566
Have you asked
why he's pulled away?

31:00.567 --> 31:02.485
I mean,
if he's not hanging with us,

31:02.569 --> 31:02.944
what is he doing?

31:12.328 --> 31:13.955
Three's too many,
don't you think?

31:15.039 --> 31:17.041
- What?
- The pies.

31:17.125 --> 31:20.044
- You went a little overboard.
- Oh. Yeah.

31:20.128 --> 31:21.796
I had a lot of energy
to burn. Um...

31:21.879 --> 31:25.216
Plus, I have a lot
to be grateful for today.

31:25.300 --> 31:26.259
Aw.

31:27.385 --> 31:29.304
We seem to be missing
the knives.

31:30.430 --> 31:32.098
Oh, um, I made sure
that the turkey

31:32.181 --> 31:33.224
was extra tender,
so no blades necessary.

31:33.308 --> 31:34.892
Oh, honey,

31:36.436 --> 31:38.479
I'm not an infant.

31:38.563 --> 31:40.523
You don't have
to babyproof for me.

31:40.607 --> 31:41.357
Okay, I threw out
all the alcohol too.

31:41.441 --> 31:43.484
Sweetie...

31:44.110 --> 31:45.278
Come on, sit down.

31:45.737 --> 31:48.823
Listen, I...

31:48.906 --> 31:52.493
I so appreciate all the work
that you've put into this,

31:53.328 --> 31:55.038
but I just spent
the last two weeks

31:55.121 --> 31:56.998
in a hospital room.
And....

31:58.958 --> 32:01.044
now that I'm sitting here,
I realize

32:01.961 --> 32:03.713
I'd like to be in the world.

32:04.464 --> 32:06.132
I would like to know

32:06.215 --> 32:07.967
that there's more to life
than a table for two.

32:08.051 --> 32:12.472
- Even if it is impeccably set.
- Of course. Um...

32:13.681 --> 32:16.392
I think it's probably too late
to get a res...

32:16.476 --> 32:17.477
Yeah.

32:17.894 --> 32:19.562
Unless...

32:24.567 --> 32:26.611
Since when is eating Chinese
in front of the TV

32:26.694 --> 32:28.071
a black-tie affair?

32:28.154 --> 32:31.032

something out.

Although I can tell
by the tone of your voice,

you're taking coats?

Oh, one more.

- Good memory.
- And Jordan?

what he drinks.

and hang out with you.

we could... hang at your place?

and he said it was okay.

38:02.446 --> 38:04.073

needs any help.

get right by you...

that you're here.

42:35.761 --> 42:39.056
I didn't wanna be that fan,
but I saw

42:39.139 --> 42:43.811
your National Theatre Live
<i>Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,</i> and wept.

42:43.894 --> 42:45.229
That was Sienna Miller, darling.

42:46.397 --> 42:49.024
No, I'm sure that was you.

42:49.108 --> 42:51.026
- No.

42:51.110 --> 42:52.444
What are you doing after this?
I was thinking

42:52.528 --> 42:55.531
maybe we could
all watch a movie.

42:55.614 --> 42:59.118
- I'm hanging with Obie.
- Is that really what you want?

42:59.201 --> 43:01.578
Or do you wanna spend some time
with your family?

43:01.662 --> 43:05.207
No. I want to spend time
with my boyfriend, alone.

43:05.291 --> 43:08.168
Obie, Aki has something
he'd like to ask you.

43:08.252 --> 43:09.837
- About what?
No, I don't.

43:09.920 --> 43:11.005
Yes, he does.

43:12.089 --> 43:14.466
Have you been avoiding him
since you found out?

43:14.550 --> 43:15.676
Since I found out what?

43:15.759 --> 43:17.886
All right. This is a good time
maybe for us to go.

43:17.970 --> 43:19.805
No, darling. No. No.
Don't be so rude.

43:19.888 --> 43:22.349
Look, Mick has prepared
this wonderful food.

43:22.433 --> 43:23.559
- Who?
- Mick.

43:23.642 --> 43:25.436
- No. It's Nick.
Huh?

43:25.519 --> 43:29.398
- It's N-- Nick.
- I like Mick. It's earthier.
Don't you think?

43:29.481 --> 43:31.483
I just think
maybe you aren't ready

43:31.567 --> 43:34.570
to spend time
with your boyfriend alone.

43:34.653 --> 43:36.822
- I said it was okay.
- Yeah, but maybe
you shouldn't have.

43:36.905 --> 43:39.074
- Julien.
- I'm just looking out for you.

43:39.158 --> 43:40.993
- You're too young.
- Too young for what?

43:41.076 --> 43:42.453
You have to admit
you've been weird.

43:42.536 --> 43:43.746
I have not.

43:43.829 --> 43:44.913
So, you're saying
you're cool with me?

43:44.997 --> 43:46.790
Look, I would have preferred
if you had told me yourself.

43:46.874 --> 43:50.377
- I am telling you.
- Okay. And I'm--
I'm fine with it.

43:50.461 --> 43:52.129
What are you even
still doing here?

43:52.212 --> 43:54.673
If you wanna go, go.
Leaving, very on brand for you.

43:54.757 --> 43:58.052
- What are you talking about?
Yes. Please tell us.

43:58.135 --> 44:00.387
Just maybe don't tell everyone.

44:00.471 --> 44:02.097
Uh, I may have my faults,
Gideon, but, uh,

44:02.181 --> 44:03.390
your behavior hasn't helped.

44:03.474 --> 44:04.725
- My behavior?
Yeah.

44:04.808 --> 44:07.644
Because you've been such
a stellar example for our son.

44:07.728 --> 44:09.146
At least I know what he's up to.

44:09.229 --> 44:12.232
Up to? He's not up to anything
since you left us.

44:12.316 --> 44:13.734
Oh, I'm talking
about what's going on

44:13.817 --> 44:15.486
- with his teacher, okay?

44:15.569 --> 44:16.612
Dad, Julien is just jealous
of my relationship with Obie,

44:16.695 --> 44:18.405
and so she's trying
to sabotage it again.

44:18.489 --> 44:21.200
I'm not trying
to sabotage anything.

44:21.283 --> 44:22.451
How about
we talk about it tonight?

44:22.534 --> 44:24.703
Our usual
post-Thanksgiving sleepover?

44:24.787 --> 44:26.747
- I have plans with Zoya.
- No, you don't.

44:26.830 --> 44:29.375
- Yes, he does.
- Then, tomorrow?

44:29.458 --> 44:31.794
Look, what are you...
What are you doing, man?

44:31.877 --> 44:33.921
I have no problem
with you being...

44:34.004 --> 44:35.422
- you know, being...
- What?

44:35.506 --> 44:37.466
- You can say it, can't you?
- I can--

44:37.549 --> 44:39.051
But the "too young" part?

44:39.134 --> 44:42.179
- Dad, she's-- she's just lying.
- Lying about what, Zoya?

44:42.262 --> 44:45.265
It's Thanksgiving.
Stop it, both of you, right now.

44:45.349 --> 44:47.393
Stop Zoya
from making a terrible mistake?

44:47.476 --> 44:49.436
- Somebody has to.
- Is that a dig at me?

44:49.520 --> 44:51.105
You know what?
We don't have to hang tonight

44:51.188 --> 44:52.523
or tomorrow or ever.

44:52.606 --> 44:55.275
Audrey and I are gonna
be too busy

44:55.359 --> 44:56.276
- fucking Max again anyway.
Akeno!

44:58.779 --> 45:00.406
That's--
- Oh, God.

45:00.489 --> 45:01.281
Can anyone trade seats with me?

45:01.365 --> 45:04.243
- I will.
- Wait, is that a joke?

45:09.706 --> 45:12.835
Your teacher?
You knew about this?

45:12.918 --> 45:14.920
Rafa's only ten years older
than me.

45:15.003 --> 45:16.713
That's less age difference
between you two.

45:16.797 --> 45:19.800
Oh, yeah,
but Pops was never my teacher.

45:19.883 --> 45:21.760
Can we go back
to the "too young" part?

45:21.844 --> 45:24.263
You could have kept
the "fucking" part out

45:24.346 --> 45:28.016
in front of my mom,
but, uh, I am very proud of you.

45:28.100 --> 45:32.312
I have some follow-up questions,
but I'm proud of you too.

45:32.396 --> 45:35.524
I'm just really processing
a lot of information.

45:35.607 --> 45:36.900
If your mother could see
both of you right now--

45:36.984 --> 45:38.777
Stop using her to manipulate us.

45:38.861 --> 45:40.487
For once,
I agree with my sister.

45:40.571 --> 45:43.031
This is the exact reason that
Nick and I did this tonight.

45:43.115 --> 45:44.491
Now, we've had it
with the back and forth.
It stops now.

45:44.575 --> 45:47.619
- You don't get to--
- No more!

45:48.871 --> 45:49.955
We're serious.

45:50.038 --> 45:51.415
It took you guys 14 years
to be in the same room together.

45:51.498 --> 45:54.168
Stop acting like
it was so easy for--

45:54.251 --> 45:56.253
Oh, you have no idea
how hard it was.

45:56.336 --> 45:57.671
It still is.
But we do it for you.

46:01.925 --> 46:05.596
It's not Rafa's fault.
It's mine.

46:05.679 --> 46:08.182
I went after him. I pursued him.

46:08.265 --> 46:09.224
He said we shouldn't,
repeatedly,

46:09.308 --> 46:11.810
but I wore him down.

46:12.436 --> 46:14.438
And I'm not proud of it.

46:14.521 --> 46:17.107
I feel pretty fucked up
about it, actually.

46:19.276 --> 46:21.278
I've wanted him
to feel bad, but...

46:22.696 --> 46:22.738
I don't know.

46:26.200 --> 46:27.367
It wasn't his fault.

46:29.453 --> 46:29.703
Not just his fault.

46:43.217 --> 46:44.051
When you were born,

46:44.134 --> 46:45.761
your mother and I were still
legally married.

46:48.138 --> 46:49.932
And I was so angry at her...

46:51.725 --> 46:55.604
for leaving us. Angrier at him.

46:55.687 --> 46:59.691
And when she got admitted
to the hospital to have you,

47:00.984 --> 47:01.944
I was the one who got the call.

47:03.487 --> 47:05.239
I was her husband, after all.

47:06.240 --> 47:08.534
And I didn't know
that she was sick,

47:08.617 --> 47:10.827
uh, that her pregnancy
had been so risky.

47:11.995 --> 47:14.331
All I knew was that this
was my chance to hurt them both

47:14.414 --> 47:16.708
for what they'd done to me.

47:17.376 --> 47:18.585
So I went to the hospital

47:18.669 --> 47:20.462
and I told them
I was her husband...

47:20.546 --> 47:21.588
Which he was.

47:21.672 --> 47:23.924
...and to not to let
anyone else in.

47:24.633 --> 47:26.218
And they didn't.

47:26.301 --> 47:27.636
- But--
Not only did your father

47:27.719 --> 47:30.347
not get to be there
for your birth...

47:31.306 --> 47:33.600
he never got to see
your mother again.

47:36.436 --> 47:39.940
- How could you?
- Yeah, that's... that's...

47:40.023 --> 47:41.400
You need to understand...

47:42.859 --> 47:44.444
I would have done
the same thing.

47:44.528 --> 47:45.529
What?

47:46.405 --> 47:48.156
I did a truly terrible thing,

47:48.240 --> 47:51.868
and because of it, you girls
never got to know each other.

47:51.952 --> 47:54.538
- But if I can sit here now--
- If we can.

47:54.621 --> 47:57.624
If we can sit here together
as a family, then...

47:58.542 --> 48:00.043
you two can get past
whatever it is

48:00.127 --> 48:03.463
that is going on between you.
You're sisters.

48:03.547 --> 48:04.965
Do not screw it up
for another 15 years.

48:09.469 --> 48:10.470
I lied.

48:12.639 --> 48:15.309
I didn't just come back
to get you two back together.

48:17.227 --> 48:19.563
I was fired
from the Mike Leigh movie.

48:20.731 --> 48:23.358
Sorry, Gideon darling,
I wasn't going to say anything,

48:23.442 --> 48:25.360
but then, I don't know,
I just did.

48:25.444 --> 48:27.112
- Aw.

48:27.195 --> 48:29.489
Oh, bear.

48:29.573 --> 48:32.367
- Everyone gets fired sometimes.

48:32.451 --> 48:36.496
But this was my second strike
after that zoom Polanski.

48:36.580 --> 48:40.250
You know? Everyone
gave their fee to charity,

48:40.334 --> 48:44.588
but I didn't get Gal's text
till it was in the <i>Daily Mail.</i>

48:44.671 --> 48:46.298
We're sorry.
We're very sorry.

48:46.381 --> 48:48.925
You know you're the only
people I really love, and...

48:50.093 --> 48:52.346
I just didn't want
to be alone.

48:52.429 --> 48:54.348
You three have always
been so strong,

48:54.431 --> 48:57.017
I thought you could
get through everything. I...

48:57.100 --> 48:59.019
darling, I need to believe that
so that I can too.

49:00.562 --> 49:01.688
Please.

49:06.485 --> 49:08.278
Okay, fine.

49:08.820 --> 49:10.864
I'll listen to it.

49:12.908 --> 49:17.120
I know that I've been, uh,
teasing for hours

49:17.204 --> 49:19.206
about how tonight is special.

49:19.289 --> 49:21.541
And I promised Davis
I wouldn't say anything,

49:21.625 --> 49:25.170
but, uh, in light of the truths
that we're sharing...

49:27.255 --> 49:29.883
we're engaged.

49:30.676 --> 49:31.885
Oh, Jesus.

49:31.968 --> 49:33.929
Why would my dad say
to stay away from you?

49:35.514 --> 49:38.225
Me? That's ridiculous.

49:38.308 --> 49:40.852
He left a voicemail saying,
"Stay away from Julien."

49:40.936 --> 49:42.396
Did you do something?

49:44.022 --> 49:47.776
No. She, uh, no. No, she didn't.
Aki, why are you shit-stirring?

49:47.859 --> 49:49.236
- Stop.
- Listen to it yourself.

49:49.319 --> 49:52.364
Must be better than clickbait
to get on my dad's radar.

49:52.447 --> 49:54.408
<i>I forgot to mention.</i>

49:54.491 --> 49:57.744
<i>Just for a little while,
at least, stay away from Julien.</i>

49:57.828 --> 49:59.955
- Holy shit.
I know, right?

50:00.038 --> 50:01.790
<i>If you call me back,
I'll talk you through it.</i>

50:01.873 --> 50:04.167
- You slept together.
- What?

50:04.251 --> 50:06.628
- Of course we didn't.
- Aki, can I hear that?

50:06.712 --> 50:08.296
You wanna hear
my dad's voicemail?

50:08.380 --> 50:11.174
Who is his dad?
- Roger Menzies.

50:11.258 --> 50:13.760
- Oh, that old billionaire?
- We're divorced.

50:13.844 --> 50:16.555
- Did you or didn't you?
No, we did not.

50:16.638 --> 50:18.974
Zoya, of course we did not. No.

50:19.057 --> 50:21.184
- Yes, we did.
- No, we did... No, we did not.

50:21.268 --> 50:22.436
Yes, we did.

50:25.230 --> 50:28.942
It was a mistake,
and it will never happen again.

50:33.113 --> 50:35.991
- I think you better leave.

50:39.035 --> 50:39.119
Hey.

50:40.370 --> 50:42.122
Okay.

50:42.998 --> 50:45.208
Whoo! Excuse us.

50:45.917 --> 50:49.796
What we sent is all we have.

50:49.880 --> 50:52.048
<i>It's all you needed.
Check your IG.</i>

50:54.301 --> 50:57.220
<i>I wanted revenge on him.
A student.</i>

50:58.430 --> 51:00.807
<i>A 17-year-old kid.</i>

51:00.891 --> 51:02.934
<i>When you sent that,
it became clear,</i>

51:05.020 --> 51:06.563
I needed him to want me

51:07.814 --> 51:08.815
<i>because when he did...</i>

51:08.899 --> 51:11.777
I didn't have to face
what I was doing.

51:14.821 --> 51:16.615
<i>Thank you for sending
the only video I needed.</i>

51:17.908 --> 51:19.993
I just got off the phone
with the Burton. I quit.

51:21.244 --> 51:22.662
You did? That's...

51:23.914 --> 51:26.541
the exact thing
that you should do.

51:26.625 --> 51:29.294
<i>And if I were you,
I'd quit too.</i>

51:29.377 --> 51:30.796
What you're doing
to those kids...

51:30.879 --> 51:33.840
I read the DMs
that came in all day.

51:33.924 --> 51:36.259
Each one more vicious
than the next.

51:36.343 --> 51:38.053
<i>They're turning
against each other.</i>

51:39.096 --> 51:40.096
<i>You're not making them better,
Kate.</i>

51:41.765 --> 51:42.766
Be careful.

51:44.851 --> 51:45.477
You've read enough to know
this doesn't end well

51:45.560 --> 51:47.312
for anyone...

51:48.438 --> 51:49.523
<i>especially you.</i>

52:01.827 --> 52:03.912
I'll be right back, okay?

52:14.464 --> 52:17.717
I wanna make this very clear
because I wanna make sure

52:17.801 --> 52:21.137
that you really, truly hear me.

52:21.221 --> 52:22.097
- Z--
- I could have handled

52:22.180 --> 52:24.850
the first boy I've ever loved
cheating on me.

52:25.976 --> 52:27.686
But the fact
that it was with you...

52:29.729 --> 52:32.524
that you kept it a secret
from me, lied to me?

52:33.984 --> 52:36.319
There's no coming back
from that.

52:40.323 --> 52:41.157
We're not sisters.

52:42.659 --> 52:43.702
We're not friends.

52:44.703 --> 52:45.078
We're not even enemies.

52:48.498 --> 52:49.291
We're nothing.

53:02.095 --> 53:05.807
- I am so sorry about tonight.

53:05.891 --> 53:07.726
Why? That was like the best
Thanksgiving I've ever had.

53:07.809 --> 53:10.186
- Ever?
- Yeah.

53:10.270 --> 53:12.355
I have been so wrapped up
in my own bullshit,

53:12.439 --> 53:13.773
I completely forgot
how messed up

53:13.857 --> 53:14.816
other people's lives are.
It's not just me.

53:14.900 --> 53:17.777
- You have no idea.
- Well...

53:17.861 --> 53:20.238
- Okay. I'm gonna get us a Lyft.
- I wanna walk.

53:20.322 --> 53:22.198
- Okay. We can walk.
- By myself.

53:23.366 --> 53:24.576
- Why?

53:24.659 --> 53:28.330
It's been so long
since I've felt free and hopeful

53:28.413 --> 53:31.124
and full of possibility.
You know what I mean?

53:31.207 --> 53:33.126
- Yeah, I do.
- Yeah. I know you do.

53:33.209 --> 53:35.295
- Mom, stop.

53:36.671 --> 53:38.757
- I love you.
- I love you so much.

53:39.799 --> 53:40.926
Text me when you get home, okay?

53:41.009 --> 53:41.134
Okay, Mom.

53:48.850 --> 53:50.018
- I'm so sorry.
- Whoa.

53:50.101 --> 53:51.770
I thought-- Oh, my gosh.

53:51.853 --> 53:54.230
- Are you okay? Here.
- I'm...

53:55.231 --> 53:57.233
Oh...

53:57.317 --> 53:59.194
- Here.
- Thank you.

54:01.029 --> 54:03.198
I think I drank a--
a little too much.

54:03.281 --> 54:06.326
I was just so afraid
I would spill our secret.

54:10.622 --> 54:13.500
No one applauded,
or even said congratulations.

54:13.583 --> 54:15.335
Saskia Bates didn't even
wanna see the ring.

54:17.462 --> 54:20.215
I'm pretty sure that Julien
doesn't like me.

54:20.298 --> 54:23.259
This is not what I thought
being engaged would feel like.

54:25.345 --> 54:25.428
I'm so...

54:27.681 --> 54:31.184
sad.

54:31.267 --> 54:33.478
Everyone was distracted.

54:33.561 --> 54:36.272
I-- I'm sure Julien
will come around and...

54:36.356 --> 54:39.401
You know, I've wanted him
to propose for so long,

54:39.484 --> 54:43.029
but, like, did he propose
because he loves me

54:43.113 --> 54:45.407
or because he doesn't want me
to testify against him?

Jordan, I can't. It's too big.
It's... it's not right.

55:41.880 --> 55:43.923

Gossip Girl can't tease
and not deliver.

55:49.929 --> 55:53.933
Fine. I'll use the other thing.
I didn't wanna it post before,

55:54.017 --> 55:55.435
