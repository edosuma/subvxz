WEBVTT

00:12.033 --> 00:14.133
PREVIOUSLY ON
"GREY'S ANATOMY"...

00:14.167 --> 00:16.067
I WAS DEAD. NOW I'M NOT.
ANYBODY COME LOOKING
FOR ME YET?

00:16.100 --> 00:17.500
NO HITS FROM MISSING PERSONS,
PLUS--

00:17.533 --> 00:20.100
MY FACE IS HARD TO IDENTIFY.
ANYONE KNOW WHO THE NEW
CHIEF CANDIDATE IS?

00:20.133 --> 00:21.700
(Derek) COLIN MARLOWE.
(Preston) THE ONE AND ONLY.

00:21.733 --> 00:24.267
HE...
YES.

00:24.300 --> 00:26.433
WITH...
YES.

00:26.467 --> 00:28.667
...THAT YOUR BEST FRIEND
VIOLENTLY DISSES OUR MARRIAGE

00:28.700 --> 00:32.133
EVERY CHANCE SHE GETS...
SHE HAS FEELINGS FOR YOU!
(laughs) IS SHE CRAZY?

00:35.300 --> 00:38.200
***

00:44.167 --> 00:46.233
(Meredith) SURGEONS
ALWAYS HAVE A PLAN...

00:46.267 --> 00:47.833
***

00:47.867 --> 00:49.200
WHERE TO CUT,

00:49.233 --> 00:52.367
WHERE TO CLAMP,
WHERE TO STITCH.

00:54.600 --> 00:57.200
MM. (groans)
(gasps)

00:57.233 --> 00:58.700
COMPLICATIONS CAN ARISE,

00:58.733 --> 01:01.333
THINGS CAN GO WRONG...
(groans)

01:01.367 --> 01:05.267
AND SUDDENLY YOU'RE CAUGHT
WITH YOUR PANTS DOWN.

01:05.300 --> 01:09.067
WOW. YOU AND GEORGE WERE
REALLY GOING AT IT LAST NIGHT.

01:09.100 --> 01:10.133
(coughs) WHAT?

01:10.167 --> 01:12.067
OH, THE LAUGHING,
THE DRINKING,

01:12.100 --> 01:14.533
THE MUSIC--
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

01:14.567 --> 01:15.767
NOBODY, MEANING ME,

01:15.800 --> 01:18.533
NEEDS TO HEAR GEORGE'S
RENDITION OF "SEXY BACK"

01:18.567 --> 01:19.733
AT 3:00 IN THE MORNING.

01:19.767 --> 01:21.667
YEAH. YOU SHOULDA--
YOU SHOULDA JUST, YOU KNOW,

01:21.700 --> 01:23.333
SAID SOMETHING OR--OR...

01:23.367 --> 01:25.067
BANGED ON THE WALL.

01:25.100 --> 01:26.800
IT'S LIKE LIVING
IN A YOUTH HOSTEL.

01:26.833 --> 01:30.067
WELL, THE IMPORTANT THING IS,
IS THAT SHE AND GEORGE MADE UP.

01:30.100 --> 01:31.267
(Meredith) YOU DID, RIGHT?

01:31.300 --> 01:33.200
I NEED TO USE YOUR BATHROOM.

01:33.233 --> 01:34.833
WHY?
BECAUSE O'MALLEY IS PUKING
IN MINE.

01:34.867 --> 01:36.700
OKAY, YOUTH HOSTEL.
GEORGE IS STILL HERE?

01:36.733 --> 01:38.400
YES.

01:38.433 --> 01:41.600
YES, BUT ONLY BECAUSE
HE WAS TOO DRUNK TO DRIVE HOME.

01:41.633 --> 01:44.467
(chuckles) YOU KNOW,
JUST TOTALLY IMPAIRED,

01:44.500 --> 01:46.267
LIKE NO-HEAVY-MACHINERY DRUNK.

01:46.300 --> 01:47.433
WHAT'S HER PROBLEM?

01:47.467 --> 01:50.100
STILL DRUNK.

01:50.133 --> 01:51.167
WHAT'S SHE DOING HERE?

01:51.200 --> 01:53.233
SHE'S AFRAID SHE'S RUINING
HER ENGAGEMENT TO BURKE,

01:53.267 --> 01:55.733
SO SHE'S HIDING FROM HIM.
NOT ANYMORE. I HAVE A PLAN.

01:55.767 --> 01:58.567
BURKE DOESN'T WANT ME TO
MARRY HIM JUST TO APPEASE HIM--

01:58.600 --> 02:00.433
WHICH YOU ARE--
SO...

02:00.467 --> 02:01.633
WE DON'T GET MARRIED.

02:01.667 --> 02:04.433
SIMPLE. WE GO BACK
TO THE WAY IT WAS.

02:04.467 --> 02:07.467
"BE KIND. REWIND."
MY PLAN HAS A NAME.

02:07.500 --> 02:09.133
I GOTTA GO.

02:09.167 --> 02:12.067
GOTTA GET TO WORK.
I'LL SEE YOU GUYS THERE.

02:12.100 --> 02:13.833
(coughing and moaning)

02:13.867 --> 02:16.200
IS THAT GEORGE? YOU SAID
HE WAS UPSTAIRS PUKING.

02:16.233 --> 02:18.767
SO NOW HE'S DOWNSTAIRS PUKING.

02:18.800 --> 02:21.567
(George coughs and moans)

02:21.600 --> 02:22.767
IZZIE.
GEORGE.

02:22.800 --> 02:24.700
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED
LAST NIGHT?

02:24.733 --> 02:27.267
CALLIE IS GONNA KILL ME.

02:27.300 --> 02:31.100
DID I AT LEAST CALL HER
BEFORE I PASSED OUT?

02:31.133 --> 02:32.467
NO.

02:32.500 --> 02:33.833
OH. (groans)

02:33.867 --> 02:36.200
YOU DON'T...

02:36.233 --> 02:38.100
YOU DON'T REMEMBER?

02:38.133 --> 02:40.300
I REMEMBER THE BOURBON...

02:40.333 --> 02:43.200
AND, UH...

02:43.233 --> 02:44.700
I DON'T... (sighs)

02:44.733 --> 02:46.567
WHERE DID YOU SLEEP?

02:46.600 --> 02:49.367
OH. (coughs)

02:49.400 --> 02:51.300
BIG DAY.
YEAH.

02:51.333 --> 02:53.233
WHAT TIME'S YOUR INTERVIEW
WITH THE BOARD?

02:53.267 --> 02:54.467
3:00.

02:54.500 --> 02:56.400
WELL, IF YOU HAVE
ANY QUESTIONS, PLEASE--

02:56.433 --> 02:57.767
YES, THANK YOU.

02:57.800 --> 02:59.667
I THINK I HAVE EVERYTHING
WELL IN HAND.

02:59.700 --> 03:01.200
THAT'S A BIG FOLDER.
(laughs)

03:01.233 --> 03:02.567
(laughs) IT'S, UH,
IT'S NOTHING.

03:02.600 --> 03:05.100
IT'S, UH, JUST A FEW IDEAS
I HAVE FOR SEATTLE GRACE.

03:05.133 --> 03:06.633
A 10-YEAR PLAN,

03:06.667 --> 03:09.800
WHICH, UH, REALLY IS
JUST A FEW... TWEAKS.

03:09.833 --> 03:11.567
WHAT DID, UH, EINSTEIN SAY?

03:11.600 --> 03:14.600
NEWTON DID THE WORK, I'M MERELY
STANDING ON HIS SHOULDERS.

03:14.633 --> 03:17.233
AND IN THIS SCENARIO,
I'M NEWTON.

03:20.300 --> 03:21.700
AH.

03:21.733 --> 03:24.100
(groans)

03:24.133 --> 03:25.333
GEORGE...

03:25.367 --> 03:26.600
HEY.

03:26.633 --> 03:28.533
HEY. YOU LOOK NICE.

03:28.567 --> 03:30.467
I LOOK INSANE. I'M--
I'M WEARING PEARLS.

03:30.500 --> 03:32.400
LISTEN--
LISTEN, ABOUT, UH,
LAST NIGHT--

03:32.433 --> 03:33.433
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
I, UH, HAD--

03:33.467 --> 03:35.700
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO PUT
A PIN IN THAT FOR NOW,

03:35.733 --> 03:38.600
BECAUSE AS OF THIS MOMENT, YOU
AND I ARE THE PERFECT COUPLE.

03:38.633 --> 03:41.133
OKAY? WE ARE THE PERFECT,
HAPPILY MARRIED COUPLE

03:41.167 --> 03:43.133
WHO ARE PERFECT AND--
AND NEVER FIGHT,

03:43.167 --> 03:45.167
BECAUSE, UH,
BECAUSE MY DAD'S IN TOWN.

03:45.200 --> 03:46.400
WHAT?

03:46.433 --> 03:47.367
YEAH.

03:47.400 --> 03:49.067
MY DAD'S IN TOWN,

03:49.100 --> 03:52.633
AND, UH, HE WANTS TO MEET
MY HUSBAND.

03:52.667 --> 03:54.133
OH, HEY.

03:54.167 --> 03:56.267
THE O'MALLEYS.

03:56.300 --> 03:57.633
(chuckles)

03:57.667 --> 03:59.167
CARRY ON.

03:59.200 --> 04:01.400
DO YOUR STUFF,
YOUR MARRIED STUFF.

04:01.433 --> 04:03.200
YAY! (chuckles)

04:05.400 --> 04:07.267
YOU TOLD HER
ABOUT OUR FIGHT?

04:07.300 --> 04:08.233
(sighs)

04:08.267 --> 04:10.400
JUST WHEN EXACTLY
IS HE COMING?

04:10.433 --> 04:12.333
TODAY. LUNCH. CAFETERIA.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

04:12.367 --> 04:14.233
I THINK I'M GONNA
CHANGE IT TO JOE'S

04:14.267 --> 04:17.133
SO HE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO TELL
THAT STINK'S COMING FROM YOU.

04:17.167 --> 04:19.067
NO, IT'S--IT'S OKAY.
OH, GOD.

04:19.100 --> 04:20.833
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.
UH, I'M GOOD WITH PARENTS.

04:20.867 --> 04:22.400
PARENTS LOVE ME.

04:22.433 --> 04:24.333
OH, YEAH. FUNNY, FUNNY,
FUNNY LITTLE MAN.

04:24.367 --> 04:25.567
FUNNY LITTLE
SMELLY LITTLE MAN.

04:25.600 --> 04:27.467
GET IN THE SHOWER, OKAY?
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

04:27.500 --> 04:29.167
JUST GET IN THE SHOWER.

04:29.200 --> 04:31.100
I KNOW. YOU'LL SEE.
HE'S GONNA LOVE ME.

04:31.133 --> 04:32.333
OH! NO.

04:35.167 --> 04:36.500
(clears throat)

04:36.533 --> 04:38.067
WHAT'S THIS?

04:38.067 --> 04:40.333
WE BRING EACH OTHER COFFEE.
THIS IS WHAT WE DO.

04:40.367 --> 04:42.733
NO, IT'S WHAT WE USED TO DO,
BEFORE YOU MOVED IN.

04:42.767 --> 04:44.667
WE STARTED MAKING COFFEE
AT HOME.

04:44.700 --> 04:46.600
YOU KNOW, I'M--
I'M NOT REALLY INTERESTED

04:46.633 --> 04:49.233
IN GOING BACK TO THE WAY
IT USED TO BE.

04:49.267 --> 04:53.233
SO UNLESS YOU HAVE
SOMETHING ELSE TO SAY TO ME...

04:53.267 --> 04:55.200
I'VE ALREADY HAD MY COFFEE.

05:04.700 --> 05:06.267
(Colin) AH.

05:06.300 --> 05:08.167
GOOD MORNING, DOCTORS.

05:08.200 --> 05:10.100
GOOD MORNING.

05:10.133 --> 05:11.467
BIG DAY TODAY, HUH?

05:11.500 --> 05:13.367
GOOD LUCK TO ALL
AND SUNDRY, HEY?

05:16.767 --> 05:19.067
HE HAS A 10-YEAR PLAN.

05:19.100 --> 05:20.100
WHAT?

05:20.133 --> 05:22.067
HE'S PRESENTING THE BOARD
WITH A 10-YEAR PLAN

05:22.100 --> 05:24.133
FOR THE SURGICAL WING.
HE'S ONLY BEEN HERE A DAY.

05:24.167 --> 05:26.700
DID YOU SEE THAT FOLDER?
IT'S FULL OF PLANS,

05:26.733 --> 05:28.767
"TWEAKS" FOR MY HOSPITAL.

05:34.500 --> 05:36.400
THIS IS OUR COMPUTER-GENERATED
APPROXIMATION

05:36.433 --> 05:38.200
OF YOUR
ORIGINAL FACIAL STRUCTURE

05:38.233 --> 05:41.067
BASED ON THE 3-D C.T. SCANS
WE DID.

05:41.067 --> 05:44.567
IT'S WHAT YOU COULD LOOK LIKE
AFTER RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY.

05:44.600 --> 05:47.467
(types on keyboard)
OR YOU COULD LOOK LIKE THIS.

05:47.500 --> 05:49.700
(types on keyboard)
OR THIS.

05:49.733 --> 05:52.667
YOU DON'T LIKE THEM?

05:52.700 --> 05:54.600
NO, IT'S NOT THAT.

05:54.633 --> 05:56.367
IT'S...

05:56.400 --> 06:01.067
UM... HOW DOES THIS WORK
EXACTLY?

06:02.700 --> 06:06.633
HE'LL MAKE AN INCISION ALONG
YOUR HAIRLINE, AND THEN...

06:06.667 --> 06:08.800
IT'S OKAY. I CAN TAKE IT.

06:10.533 --> 06:13.600
HE'LL LITERALLY
PULL YOUR FACE OFF.

06:13.633 --> 06:16.567
(Mark) IT SOUNDS
A LOT WORSE THAN IT IS.

06:16.600 --> 06:19.467
YOUR FACE IS EXTREMELY ELASTIC,
AND PULLING IT DOWN

06:19.500 --> 06:22.067
ALLOWS ME TO REPAIR
THE BONE FRACTURES UNDERNEATH

06:22.067 --> 06:23.233
WITHOUT CAUSING ANY SCARING.

06:23.267 --> 06:24.767
AND ONCE YOU'VE HEALED,

06:24.800 --> 06:27.267
NO ONE WILL EVER KNOW
YOU HAD THE SURGERY.

06:27.300 --> 06:28.800
I'M THAT GOOD.

06:28.833 --> 06:31.233
HE IS. IT'S ANNOYING.

06:31.267 --> 06:34.500
THE SURGERY WON'T AFFECT
MY BABY?

06:34.533 --> 06:37.667
I'LL BE MONITORING
THE BABY THROUGHOUT. OKAY?

06:37.700 --> 06:39.467
OKAY.

06:39.500 --> 06:42.300
SO...

06:42.333 --> 06:44.400
THEN I-I JUST HAVE TO
PICK ONE?

06:44.433 --> 06:46.267
(sighs)

06:46.300 --> 06:48.633
DO I HAVE TO PICK ONE NOW?

06:48.667 --> 06:52.167
UM, TAKE A COUPLE HOURS
AND THINK ABOUT IT.

06:52.200 --> 06:55.700
COUPLE HOURS... YEAH.

06:57.767 --> 07:01.400
(Richard) DR. BAILEY.

07:01.433 --> 07:04.233
CHIEF, OUR JANE DOE IS
GETTING A NEW FACE TODAY.

07:04.267 --> 07:06.333
WELL, THAT'S EXCITING.

07:06.367 --> 07:08.333
HOW ARE YOU DOING, MEREDITH?

07:08.367 --> 07:11.300
YOU DIDN'T TAKE
TOO MUCH TIME OFF AFTER--
I'M FINE. REALLY, SIR.

07:11.333 --> 07:14.567
I, UH, I THINK WORKING IS
THE BEST THING I CAN DO.

07:14.600 --> 07:16.100
LIKE MOTHER,
LIKE DAUGHTER, HUH?

07:16.133 --> 07:17.733
DR. GREY,
WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME

07:17.767 --> 07:20.367
ABOUT RECONSTRUCTING
THE ORBITAL FLOOR?

07:20.400 --> 07:23.400
UH, YOU CAN CREATE A NEW BASE
FOR THE EYE SOCKET

07:23.433 --> 07:25.133
BY HARVESTING BONE
FROM THE SKULL.
DR. BAILEY,

07:25.167 --> 07:28.100
DR. GREY WILL BE SCRUBBING IN
ON THE JANE DOE SURGERY.

07:28.133 --> 07:30.433
COME ON.
I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO DO IT

07:30.467 --> 07:32.367
WITHOUT BREAKING THE BONE GRAFT
INTO A MILLION PIECES.

07:32.400 --> 07:34.067
(Richard)
CONGRATULATIONS, DR. GREY.

07:34.067 --> 07:35.367
(Miranda)
OKAY, LET'S GO, PEOPLE.

07:35.400 --> 07:38.533
IS THIS... THANKS.

07:38.567 --> 07:41.567
OH, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

07:41.600 --> 07:42.667
WHY?

07:42.700 --> 07:45.300
UH, TO PREPARE YOU GUYS
FOR WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO SEE.

07:45.333 --> 07:47.633
YOU MEANT--YOU MEANT "YOU"
LIKE "US," NOT LIKE "ME."

07:47.667 --> 07:49.567
YOU DON'T--YOU DON'T WANT
TO TALK TO ME,

07:49.600 --> 07:52.267
YOU WANT TO TALK TO US
ABOUT A PAT--ABOUT A PATIENT.

07:52.300 --> 07:53.400
THAT'S WHAT I JUST SAID.

07:53.433 --> 07:55.367
UH, THIS PATIENT HAS
A DISEASE SO RARE

07:55.400 --> 07:57.833
THAT YOU'LL PROBABLY
NEVER SEE IT AGAIN--F.O.P.

07:57.867 --> 08:00.300
OH, UH, FIBRODYSPLASIA
OSSIFICANS PROGRESSIVA?

08:00.333 --> 08:04.067
YEAH. IT'S A CONGENITAL DISEASE
WHICH TURNS MUSCLE INTO BONE.

08:04.100 --> 08:05.700
YOU BECOME A HUMAN STATUE.

08:05.733 --> 08:09.800
SO JUST, UH, TRY TO LEARN.
TRY NOT TO STARE, OKAY?

08:09.833 --> 08:12.567
OKAY.

08:12.600 --> 08:15.567
IF YOU PEOPLE ARE INTERNS,
YOU NEED TO STAND BACK.

08:15.600 --> 08:17.300
NINA, PLEASE DON'T BE RUDE.

08:17.333 --> 08:19.800
MY MOTHER STILL HAS MOVEMENT
IN HER FACE AND HANDS.

08:19.833 --> 08:22.600
I WOULD LIKE TO KEEP IT
THAT WAY, SO PLEASE BE CAREFUL.

08:22.633 --> 08:24.800
IF YOU PRESS TOO HARD
DURING AN EXAM

08:24.833 --> 08:26.500
OR BUMP INTO HER ACCIDENTALLY,

08:26.533 --> 08:28.567
IT CAUSES A BONE TO GROW
WHERE A BONE SHOULDN'T GROW.

08:28.600 --> 08:31.500
SO THERE CAN BE NO ACCIDENTS.
OKAY, REMEMBER THAT WHEN YOU'RE
DEALING WITH HER TODAY.

08:31.533 --> 08:33.533
IT'S JUST A STOMACH VIRUS OR
A FLU. I'M SURE IT'S NOTHING.

08:33.567 --> 08:35.667
NINA INSISTED THAT I COME IN.
SHE WAS VOMITING BLOOD

08:35.700 --> 08:38.267
AND GOING THROUGH HER PAIN MEDS
LIKE THEY WERE CANDY.

08:38.300 --> 08:40.433
AND SHE HAS NEW GROWTHS
ON HER BACK,

08:40.467 --> 08:42.067
NO DOUBT CAUSED

08:42.100 --> 08:44.267
BY SOME CLUMSY INTERNS
ON HER LAST HOSPITAL STAY.

08:44.300 --> 08:47.233
WELL, OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE HAVING
A FLARE-UP OF THE F.O.P.,

08:47.267 --> 08:49.767
BUT WHAT REALLY CONCERNS ME
IS THE VOMITING.

08:49.800 --> 08:52.667
SO I'M GONNA NEED A C.T.,
SEE WHAT'S GOING ON.

08:52.700 --> 08:55.467
WOW. (chuckles)
DID YOU BUILD THAT?
MY MOM DID.

08:55.500 --> 08:56.567
NO, NINA DID IT.

08:56.600 --> 09:00.067
I USED TO DO IT.
I'M NOT ABLE TO.
IT KEEPS HER ACTIVE.

09:00.067 --> 09:02.100
WHEN SHE'S ACTIVE,
SHE HAS FEWER FLARE-UPS.

09:02.133 --> 09:04.067
PLUS IT MAKES HER HAPPY...

09:04.067 --> 09:06.767
AND RELAXED.

09:06.800 --> 09:09.633
GOOD. OKAY.

09:13.500 --> 09:15.400
CAN I WORK
IN THE CLINIC TODAY?

09:15.433 --> 09:17.333
YOU DON'T WANT
THE F.O.P. CASE?

09:17.367 --> 09:19.567
CLINIC? WHY? WHAT'S GOING ON
IN THE CLINIC?

09:19.600 --> 09:22.367
NOTHING. I JUST FEEL CLINIC-Y.
THAT'S NOT A WORD.
I'LL TAKE THE CLINIC.

09:22.400 --> 09:24.300
CRISTINA!
YOU BOTH CAN GO TO THE CLINIC.

09:24.333 --> 09:26.367
THE BOARD IS INTERVIEWING
THE CHIEF CANDIDATES

09:26.400 --> 09:28.233
ALL DAY TODAY,
SO WE'RE LIGHT ON SURGERIES.

09:28.267 --> 09:29.800
O'MALLEY.
YES?

09:29.833 --> 09:31.267
YOU'RE WITH DR. O'MALLEY.

09:31.300 --> 09:33.100
OKAY.

09:33.133 --> 09:35.400
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?
FIND DR. MONTGOMERY.

09:35.433 --> 09:37.333
SEE IF YOU CAN HELP
WITH JANE DOE.

09:37.367 --> 09:39.467
(George burps)
OH.

09:39.500 --> 09:42.400
I SHOWERED TWICE.
IT'S COMING OUT OF
YOUR PORES, GEORGE.

09:42.433 --> 09:43.667
YOU REEK, YOU'RE TREMBLING,

09:43.700 --> 09:46.500
AND THERE'S NO WAY I'M LETTING
YOU NEAR MY PATIENT RIGHT NOW.

09:46.533 --> 09:48.433
DR. BAILEY.
(whispers) DON'T TELL BAILEY.
DON'T TELL BAILEY.

09:48.467 --> 09:50.767
BAILEY, UH, WITH MRS. ROGERSON'S
LIMITED MOBILITY,

09:50.800 --> 09:53.067
I'M GONNA, UH, NEED
AN EXTRA SET OF HANDS.

09:53.067 --> 09:55.067
FINE. STEVENS.

09:55.100 --> 09:57.167
YANG WILL HANDLE THE CLINIC.

09:57.200 --> 10:00.000
YOU'LL BE
WITH THE O'MALLEYS TODAY.
OH.

10:02.400 --> 10:03.600
(clears throat)

10:15.633 --> 10:17.533
IT'S MY FOOT.
IT HURTS LIKE CRAZY.

10:17.567 --> 10:19.500
I'M GONNA NEED A PAINKILLER.

10:19.533 --> 10:21.433
CAN'T SPEND THE WHOLE DAY
PROPPED ON AN ICE PACK.

10:21.467 --> 10:23.567
UH, YOU'RE GONNA NEED
TO TAKE OFF YOUR SHOE.

10:23.600 --> 10:26.233
NO, NO, NO, NO. I'VE BEEN
DOWN THIS ROUTE BEFORE.

10:26.267 --> 10:28.500
JUST SLIP ME
A COUPLE PAINKILLERS,

10:28.533 --> 10:31.100
AND I'LL BE ON MY WAY.
SIR, UH, DID YOU GO
TO MEDICAL SCHOOL?

10:31.133 --> 10:33.533
I DID. TAKE OFF YOUR SHOE.

10:33.567 --> 10:35.567
(chuckles)

10:35.600 --> 10:37.200
YOU HAVE TYPE 2 DIABETES.

10:37.233 --> 10:40.033
TEN YEARS NOW.
YEAH, WELL, YOU INSPECT
YOUR FEET EVERY DAY.

10:40.067 --> 10:41.800
HAVE YOU NOTICED ANYTHING?
I NOTICE IT HURTS.

10:41.833 --> 10:43.733
LOOK, I GOT 30 GUYS SITTING
ON THEIR ASS

10:43.767 --> 10:46.400
WAITING FOR ME TO SHOW UP.
SIR, I GET IT.

10:46.433 --> 10:49.333
YOU'RE IN A HURRY. THAT MAKES
THE TWO OF US. SOCK.

10:58.600 --> 11:00.467
(sighs)

11:00.500 --> 11:02.400
YOU NEED TO CALL YOUR GUYS

11:02.433 --> 11:04.567
AND TELL THEM
YOU'RE NOT COMING IN.

11:06.433 --> 11:08.467
(Meredith)
DID YOU CHOOSE A FACE?

11:08.500 --> 11:09.533
NOT YET.

11:09.567 --> 11:13.400
I WAS HOPING I'D SEE ONE OF 'EM
AND, I DON'T KNOW,

11:13.433 --> 11:15.100
RECOGNIZE MYSELF OR SOMETHING,

11:15.133 --> 11:18.167
BUT I DON'T RECOGNIZE
ANY OF THESE WOMEN.

11:18.200 --> 11:19.833
WHAT IF I CHOOSE
THE WRONG ONE?

11:19.867 --> 11:21.533
WHAT IF MY HUSBAND
OR BOYFRIEND

11:21.567 --> 11:24.433
OR WHOEVER'S BABY THIS IS
SHOWS UP TOMORROW WITH A--

11:24.467 --> 11:27.300
WITH A PICTURE OF WHAT
I'M SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE,

11:27.333 --> 11:28.600
BUT IT'S TOO LATE,
AND I'M STUCK

11:28.633 --> 11:30.533
WITH THE WRONG FACE
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE?

11:30.567 --> 11:33.500
OKAY, THAT WOULD SUCK,
BUT IF YOU DON'T PICK ONE...

11:33.533 --> 11:37.133
THIS IS GONNA BE YOUR FACE
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

11:37.167 --> 11:38.200
(sighs)

11:43.600 --> 11:44.533
HEY.

11:44.567 --> 11:45.600
HEY.

11:45.633 --> 11:47.700
SHOULDN'T YOU BE PREPARING
FOR YOUR BOARD INTERVIEW?

11:47.733 --> 11:49.667
I AM.

11:51.667 --> 11:52.633
MMM.

11:52.667 --> 11:54.333
YOU'RE HOVERING.

11:54.367 --> 11:56.267
NO, I'M BREATHING YOU IN.

11:56.300 --> 11:57.467
YOU'RE HOVERING.

11:57.500 --> 11:59.167
FINE. I'M HOVERING.

11:59.200 --> 12:01.100
IF CRISTINA WOULD SLEEP
IN HER OWN BED,

12:01.133 --> 12:02.833
I WOULDN'T HAVE TO HOVER
AT WORK.

12:02.867 --> 12:04.233
I COULD HOVER IN BED.

12:04.267 --> 12:06.067
A DIFFERENT TYPE
OF HOVERING PERHAPS.

12:06.100 --> 12:07.800
(sighs)

12:07.833 --> 12:10.333
HOW BAD IS IT TODAY,

12:10.367 --> 12:12.467
ON A SCALE OF ONE TO TEN?

12:12.500 --> 12:14.767
SEVEN. MAYBE A SIX.
GOOD.

12:14.800 --> 12:17.467
YOU KNOW WHAT'S GONNA MAKE IT
EVEN BETTER THAN THAT?

12:17.500 --> 12:18.667
MNH-MNH. WHAT?

12:18.700 --> 12:20.600
THE CALVARIAL BONE HARVEST
I GET TO DO

12:20.633 --> 12:22.300
ON SLOAN'S JANE DOE LATER.

12:22.333 --> 12:25.067
SLOAN'S GONNA LET YOU DO
A HARVEST... BY YOURSELF?

12:25.067 --> 12:26.133
BY MYSELF.

12:26.167 --> 12:27.733
OH.

12:27.767 --> 12:30.100
WHICH MAKES ME VERY COOL
IN THE EYES OF MY DEAD MOTHER,

12:30.133 --> 12:32.700
BY THE WAY.
OKAY, THEN. WELL, I BETTER
LET YOU STUDY.

12:32.733 --> 12:34.700
BETTER STOP DISTRACTING ME.

12:34.733 --> 12:37.600
I WILL NOT BE COOL IN THE EYES
OF MY DEAD MOTHER

12:37.633 --> 12:40.200
IF I MAIM JANE DOE.
OKAY.

12:41.500 --> 12:43.433
(C.T. whirrs)

12:43.467 --> 12:46.200
UH, WE'RE GONNA NEED YOU
TO LIE VERY STILL,

12:46.233 --> 12:47.700
MRS. ROGERSON.

12:47.733 --> 12:50.233
I THINK I CAN DO THAT,
DR. O'MALLEY.

12:53.233 --> 12:57.500
SORRY ABOUT THAT,
MRS. ROGERSON.

12:57.533 --> 12:59.667
OH. I'M NEVER
GONNA DRINK AGAIN.

12:59.700 --> 13:02.300
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I HAVE TO BE PRESENTABLE

13:02.333 --> 13:04.233
FOR CALLIE'S DAD AT LUNCH.

13:04.267 --> 13:06.267
(sighs)

13:06.300 --> 13:07.767
OH, GOD.

13:07.800 --> 13:09.300
(sighs)

13:09.333 --> 13:11.633
HOURS--

13:13.100 --> 13:16.433
MANY HOURS THAT ARE
ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT,

13:16.467 --> 13:19.700
AND YOU SERIOUSLY
DON'T REMEMBER?

13:19.733 --> 13:23.267
HOW CAN YOU NOT REMEMBER
THOSE MANY, MANY HOURS?

13:23.300 --> 13:24.467
LET--IZZIE, IF...
OH, GOD.

13:24.500 --> 13:26.400
WHATEVER I DID,
WHATEVER I SAID,

13:26.433 --> 13:29.400
I WAS DRUNK.
I'M SURE I DIDN'T MEAN IT.

13:29.433 --> 13:31.467
GEORGE, I PROMISE YOU,
YOU MEANT IT.

13:31.500 --> 13:35.100
YOU MEANT IT A LOT.
YOU MEANT IT MORE THAN ONCE.

13:35.133 --> 13:38.267
DO YOU SEE THAT?

13:38.300 --> 13:39.733
(buzzing)

13:39.767 --> 13:41.700
GOTTA PAGE CALLIE.

13:43.667 --> 13:47.633
YOU'LL BE PLEASED TO HEAR
I'M PROPOSING AN EXPANSION

13:47.667 --> 13:49.567
TO THE HOSPITAL BOARD
THIS AFTERNOON.

13:49.600 --> 13:51.500
GIVE YOU QUITE A FEW
MORE PLACES TO HIDE.

13:51.533 --> 13:53.200
I'M NOT GOING TO HIDE.

13:53.233 --> 13:55.133
I'M JUST TRYING TO FIND
MY RESIDENT.

13:55.167 --> 13:57.067
I COME HERE TO SEATTLE
TO SEE YOU,

13:57.067 --> 13:58.800
AND YOU DON'T EVEN
GIVE ME A MOMENT?

13:58.833 --> 14:01.700
YOU DIDN'T COME HERE TO SEE ME.
YOU CAME HERE TO GET A JOB.

14:01.733 --> 14:03.633
I CAME HERE FOR BOTH.
WELL, YOU MADE A MISTAKE.

14:03.667 --> 14:05.133
ARE YOU GOING TO INVITE ME?

14:05.167 --> 14:06.633
WHERE?
TO THE WEDDING.

14:06.667 --> 14:08.567
WILL YOU STOP TALKING
ABOUT THE WEDDING?

14:08.600 --> 14:11.467
MOST BLUSHING BRIDES TO BE
LOVE TO TALK ABOUT THE WEDDING.

14:11.500 --> 14:14.367
WHAT THE MATTER?
ARE WE GETTING COLD FEET.

14:14.400 --> 14:16.500
PLEASE LEAVE.

14:16.533 --> 14:19.400
IF HE'S RUSHING YOU,
YOU SHOULD TELL HIM.

14:19.433 --> 14:22.067
WHEN YOU MARRY,
YOU WANT TO BE READY.

14:22.067 --> 14:24.567
HE SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT.

14:32.533 --> 14:34.233
GOOD AFTERNOON, BOARD.

14:34.267 --> 14:35.333
NO.

14:35.367 --> 14:38.367
GOOD AFTERNOON, LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN OF THE BOARD.

14:38.400 --> 14:40.833
I AM SO GRATEFUL
FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY.

14:40.867 --> 14:42.767
DON'T WEAR THE GLASSES.

14:42.800 --> 14:45.267
YOU FIDDLE WITH 'EM.
IT MAKES YOU LOOK INDECISIVE.

14:45.300 --> 14:46.633
AND STOP STRESSING.

14:46.667 --> 14:49.133
IT'LL BE LIKE
ANY OTHER JOB INTERVIEW.

14:49.167 --> 14:51.067
"WHAT DO YOU CONSIDER
YOUR STRENGTHS?

14:51.100 --> 14:52.833
WHAT DO YOU CONSIDER
YOUR WEAKNESSES?"

14:52.867 --> 14:55.300
WHAT DO YOU CONSIDER
YOUR WEAKNESSES?

14:55.333 --> 14:58.233
I DON'T HAVE ANY.
I'M THAT GOOD.

14:58.267 --> 14:59.600
WHAT ARE YOURS?

14:59.633 --> 15:01.500
I'M AN EASY MARK
FOR EVIL REDHEADS.

15:01.533 --> 15:03.833
(chuckles) TRUST ME,

15:03.867 --> 15:06.300
YOU HAVE OTHER WEAKNESSES.

15:06.333 --> 15:07.667
OBVIOUSLY...

15:07.700 --> 15:09.300
YOU ARE A MAN-WHORE.

15:09.333 --> 15:10.667
CORRECTION.

15:10.700 --> 15:12.533
I WAS A MAN-WHORE.
YEAH, WELL,

15:12.567 --> 15:14.467
WHILE YOU'RE BRAGGING
ABOUT THAT TO THE BOARD,

15:14.500 --> 15:17.333
COLIN MARLOWE IS PITCHING
HIS 10-YEAR PLAN.

15:17.367 --> 15:20.567
10-YEAR PLAN?
WAS THAT A REQUIREMENT?

15:20.600 --> 15:22.400
IT IS NOW.

15:22.433 --> 15:24.333
MRS. ROGERSON,
ACCORDING TO YOUR C.T.,

15:24.367 --> 15:26.267
YOU HAVE
SEVERE INTERNAL BLEEDING.

15:26.300 --> 15:27.767
IT WAS PROBABLY CAUSED

15:27.800 --> 15:30.100
BY YOUR ANTI-INFLAMMATORY
MEDICATION.

15:30.133 --> 15:32.300
DOES THAT REQUIRE SURGERY?
BECAUSE SHE CAN'T HAVE ANY--

15:32.333 --> 15:34.567
OBVIOUSLY ANY SURGICAL PROCEDURE
COULD CAUSE MORE BONE GROWTH

15:34.600 --> 15:36.500
OR DO MORE DAMAGE THAN GOOD.

15:36.533 --> 15:39.100
THAT'S WHY DR. BURKE'S HERE.

15:39.133 --> 15:41.267
WHAT WE CAN DO IS INSERT
A LINE INTO YOUR GROIN

15:41.300 --> 15:44.700
AND THEN FLOAT A CATHETER UP
AND EMBOLIZE THE AREA.
THAT'S MINIMALLY INVASIVE?

15:44.733 --> 15:46.233
AS MINIMALLY INVASIVE
AS POSSIBLE.

15:46.267 --> 15:49.133
BUT WITH YOUR CONDITION,
EVEN THIS IS RISKY.

15:49.167 --> 15:51.300
I'M 41 YEARS OLD.

15:51.333 --> 15:54.400
MOST F.O.P. PATIENTS
DON'T LIVE TO 45.

15:54.433 --> 15:57.267
I'M DOWN TO THE USE
OF MY FACE AND HANDS.

15:57.300 --> 15:59.133
PRETTY SOON
I WON'T HAVE ANYTHING.

15:59.167 --> 16:03.400
SO WHAT WOULD HAPPEN...
IF I REFUSE THE SURGERY?

16:05.300 --> 16:07.300
YOU WILL BLEED TO DEATH...

16:07.333 --> 16:10.067
WITHIN A DAY OR TWO.

16:10.100 --> 16:12.133
IS THAT PAINFUL?

16:12.167 --> 16:13.500
MOM, STOP, OKAY?

16:13.533 --> 16:15.100
NINA, PLEASE.
LET ME THINK.

16:15.133 --> 16:17.067
THE REASON YOU'VE GOTTEN
THIS FAR--

16:17.067 --> 16:19.067
OUR TREATMENT PLAN WORKS.

16:19.067 --> 16:22.767
IT WILL WORK.

16:24.433 --> 16:27.367
(Mark)
BURKE IS USING PowerPoint.

16:27.400 --> 16:29.700
HE'S DOING A PowerPoint
PRESENTATION FOR THE BOARD,

16:29.733 --> 16:33.200
WHICH IS COOL
IF IT'S, LIKE, 1998.

16:33.233 --> 16:36.367
THERE'S NO SWAG, IS THERE?

16:36.400 --> 16:38.300
WE'RE NOT ALLOWED
TO GIVE GIFTS?

16:38.333 --> 16:41.200
WHY DID YOU ASK MEREDITH

16:41.233 --> 16:44.767
TO DO A BONE GRAFT
ON YOUR JANE DOE?

16:44.800 --> 16:48.367
BECAUSE I'M HER TEACHER,
AND THAT'S MY JOB.

16:48.400 --> 16:50.300
YOU'RE DOING IT
TO IMPRESS THE CHIEF.

16:50.333 --> 16:53.200
YOU'RE SETTING HER UP,
AND SHE CAN'T FAIL RIGHT NOW.

16:53.233 --> 16:55.133
WHY DON'T YOU LET YOUR
GIRLFRIEND DECIDE

16:55.167 --> 16:57.067
WHAT SHE CAN OR CAN'T DO?

16:57.100 --> 17:00.767
I WILL HURT YOU
IF THIS GOES WRONG FOR HER.

17:06.267 --> 17:07.600
HUH.

17:07.633 --> 17:08.567
IS...

17:08.600 --> 17:10.467
IS THAT A...

17:10.500 --> 17:12.800
DOLLHOUSE? YEAH.
THE LIGHTS WORK AND EVERYTHING.

17:12.833 --> 17:14.367
IT'S THE PERFECT LITTLE HOME.

17:14.400 --> 17:18.100
OH. DID YOU HAVE
A DOLLHOUSE GROWING UP?

17:18.133 --> 17:20.067
I HAD SEX LAST NIGHT...

17:20.100 --> 17:22.200
WITH THE WRONG PERSON.

17:22.233 --> 17:25.600
BUT THE THING IS, IT DIDN'T
FEEL WRONG AT THE TIME.

17:25.633 --> 17:28.733
IT FELT LIKE... SOMETHING
WAS FALLING INTO PLACE.

17:28.767 --> 17:30.667
(clears throat)
SO WHAT DO I DO?

17:30.700 --> 17:34.300
(clears throat) WHAT AM I,
THE GO-TO PERSON FOR ADULTERY?

17:34.333 --> 17:36.800
NO. I... I JUST...

17:36.833 --> 17:39.600
I JUST DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

17:39.633 --> 17:42.367
YOU STOP.

17:42.400 --> 17:44.067
THAT'S WHAT YOU DO.

17:44.100 --> 17:45.467
ARE YOU SURE?

17:45.500 --> 17:48.667
I MEAN, HOW DO YOU KNOW
THAT IT DIDN'T FEEL SO RIGHT

17:48.700 --> 17:51.133
BECAUSE... IT'S GOD'S PLAN?

17:51.167 --> 17:54.367
GOD WANTS YOU
TO BE AN ADULTERER?

17:54.400 --> 17:55.600
(clears throat)

17:55.633 --> 17:57.500
GOD GOT A VIRGIN PREGNANT
BY MAGIC.

17:57.533 --> 18:00.267
GOD IS NOT PLAYING
BY THE RULES.

18:00.300 --> 18:01.633
UH-HUH. UH, TALK TO PAUL.

18:01.667 --> 18:03.167
MR. KENDRY.

18:03.200 --> 18:06.133
NO, PAUL WILL GET
YOU DRYWALL NUMBERS.

18:06.167 --> 18:07.267
MR. KENDRY.

18:07.300 --> 18:10.767
OKAY. LET ME JUST WRITE
A COUPLE NOTES ABOUT THAT CALL.

18:10.800 --> 18:15.233
MR. KENDRY, WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO AMPUTATE YOUR FOOT.

18:15.267 --> 18:16.600
WHAT?

18:16.633 --> 18:18.533
THE INFECTION IS IN THE BONE.

18:18.567 --> 18:21.433
IF WE DON'T REMOVE THE FOOT,
IT WILL TRAVEL TO YOUR BLOOD,

18:21.467 --> 18:23.333
AND THAT WILL CAUSE SEPSIS
AND POSSIBLE DEATH.

18:23.367 --> 18:26.467
I'M SORRY.

18:26.500 --> 18:28.300
Y--

18:28.333 --> 18:30.367
HOW CAN YOU BE SO...

18:30.400 --> 18:33.400
I MEAN,
I-I CAN'T GET AROUND A...

18:33.433 --> 18:35.333
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

18:35.367 --> 18:37.267
NO, NO. YOU'RE NOT
CUTTING OFF MY FOOT.

18:37.300 --> 18:39.733
SIR, DIABETES IS
A MANAGEABLE DISEASE.

18:39.767 --> 18:41.667
IF YOU HAD BEEN HERE
EVEN A MONTH AGO,

18:41.700 --> 18:43.600
MAYBE WE COULD'VE--
OKAY, SO I SCREWED UP.

18:43.633 --> 18:45.667
BUT YOU'RE TELLING ME
THAT THIS IS MY ONLY OPTION

18:45.700 --> 18:48.167
BECAUSE I'M LATE
GETTING IN HERE?

18:48.200 --> 18:50.133
THAT THERE IS NO WAY--
MR. KENDRY--

18:50.167 --> 18:52.067
NO!

18:53.733 --> 18:57.333
PLEASE. THERE'S GOTTA BE A WAY
FOR ME TO GET THAT MONTH BACK.

18:57.367 --> 19:00.233
TELL ME WHAT TO DO.
I'LL DO IT.

19:00.267 --> 19:03.133
I'LL DO EVERY LINE
OF EVERY PLAN YOU GIVE ME.

19:03.167 --> 19:04.500
I'LL DO IT.

19:04.533 --> 19:07.300
PLEASE.

19:07.333 --> 19:10.600
YOU GOTTA FIND A WAY
TO SAVE MY FOOT.

19:17.767 --> 19:20.233
HEY, WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF A ROBOTICS LAB

19:20.267 --> 19:22.633
AS A GOAL
FOR THE HOSPITAL, HMM?

19:22.667 --> 19:24.600
DEREK...
YOU'RE HARVESTING.

19:24.633 --> 19:26.133
I'M TRYING
TO BE SUPPORTIVE...
MM-HMM.

19:26.167 --> 19:27.800
BUT THIS GRAFT,
IT'S REALLY TRICKY.

19:27.833 --> 19:30.400
MM-HMM. YOU DON'T HAVE TO
DO IT, YOU KNOW?

19:30.433 --> 19:32.333
I TALKED TO MARK, AND, UH--
YOU WHAT?

19:32.367 --> 19:33.467
I TALKED TO MARK.

19:33.500 --> 19:36.400
I MEAN, MEREDITH, THIS IS A--
IT'S A COMPLEX PROCEDURE--

19:36.433 --> 19:38.267
YOU DON'T THINK
I CAN DO IT?

19:38.300 --> 19:41.167
WHEN HAS MARK SLOAN ALLOWED
HIS INTERNS TO DO ANYTHING,

19:41.200 --> 19:43.100
LET ALONE
HARVEST A BONE GRAFT?

19:43.133 --> 19:45.567
HE'S IN THE RACE FOR CHIEF.

19:45.600 --> 19:47.500
HE'S TRYING TO PROVE
HE CAN TEACH.
BY TEACHING YOU.

19:47.533 --> 19:48.567
YOUR MOTHER DIED,

19:48.600 --> 19:51.067
AND THE CHIEF IS GONNA BE
WATCHING YOU VERY CLOSELY.

19:51.100 --> 19:53.300
AND MARK IS TRYING
TO GAIN POINTS BY--
USING ME.

19:53.333 --> 19:55.333
IF IT GOES WELL,
HE GETS THE CREDIT.

19:55.367 --> 19:57.267
IF IT GOES POORLY,
HE GETS THE SAVE.

19:57.300 --> 20:00.433
SO THIS IS ABOUT YOU
ONE-UPPING MARK.

20:00.467 --> 20:01.800
HE'S USING YOU.

20:01.833 --> 20:03.733
I'M JUST TRYING
TO PROTECT YOU.

20:03.767 --> 20:05.667
YOU DON'T NEED TO.

20:05.700 --> 20:08.300
CLOSE THE DOOR
ON YOUR WAY OUT.

20:22.467 --> 20:24.267
CAN I HELP YOU WITH THOSE,
DR. BAILEY?

20:24.300 --> 20:26.633
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
SEE, THAT'S WHAT I LIKE
ABOUT YOU.

20:26.667 --> 20:28.567
YOU ALWAYS GET
RIGHT TO THE POINT.

20:28.600 --> 20:31.200
MAKE IT QUICK. I'M HEADED
OVER TO THE CLINIC.
ALL RIGHT.

20:31.233 --> 20:33.767
WHAT WOULD YOU CHANGE ABOUT
THIS HOSPITAL IF YOU COULD?

20:33.800 --> 20:35.700
IS THIS
FOR YOUR BOARD INTERVIEW?

20:35.733 --> 20:37.667
YOU WANT ME TO DO
YOUR HOMEWORK FOR YOU

20:37.700 --> 20:39.600
BECAUSE I'M NOT BUSY ENOUGH,
IS THAT IT?

20:39.633 --> 20:42.500
ALL THE OTHER ATTENDINGS ARE
PUTTING TOGETHER 10-YEAR PLANS.

20:42.533 --> 20:44.433
I WAS JUST LOOKING
FOR SOME INPUT.

20:44.467 --> 20:45.800
INPUT? YOU WANT--

20:45.833 --> 20:48.300
I HAVE PATIENTS IN NEED
OF MEDICAL ATTENTION RIGHT NOW.

20:48.333 --> 20:51.200
THIS GUY HERE IS ABOUT
TO HAVE ONE LESS APPENDAGE.

20:51.233 --> 20:53.133
I DON'T HAVE
A 10-YEAR PLAN FOR HIM.

20:53.167 --> 20:55.333
I HAVE A "RIGHT NOW" PLAN
FOR HIM--

20:55.367 --> 20:57.300
CUT OFF HIS FOOT
TO SAVE HIS LIFE.

20:57.333 --> 21:00.067
SO YOU NEED TO GET OUT OF
MY WAY RIGHT NOW

21:00.067 --> 21:02.067
SO I CAN DO MY JOB.

21:02.067 --> 21:03.567
RIGHT NOW?

21:03.600 --> 21:04.700
RIGHT NOW.

21:04.733 --> 21:07.367
***

21:07.400 --> 21:10.400
TALK TO ME ABOUT BLACKOUTS.
ARE THEY REAL?

21:10.433 --> 21:12.200
DO YOU REALLY NOT REMEMBER
ANYTHING AFTERWARDS?

21:12.233 --> 21:14.400
IZ, I'M FINE. NOT DRINKING.
I'M NOT DROWNING MY SORROWS.

21:14.433 --> 21:16.067
FINE.

21:16.067 --> 21:19.067
EVERYBODY NEEDS TO STOP TRYING
TO PROTECT ME.

21:19.067 --> 21:21.267
UM, THIS ISN'T...
REALLY ABOUT YOU.

21:21.300 --> 21:24.167
I'M ASKING, BACK WHEN YOU HAD
A BEST FRIEND NAMED TEQUILA,

21:24.200 --> 21:27.600
DID YOU ACTUALLY
EVER BLACKOUT?

21:27.633 --> 21:29.600
ONCE. NO, TWICE.

21:29.633 --> 21:31.467
BUT THE STUFF
YOU DON'T REMEMBER

21:31.500 --> 21:33.533
IS USUALLY THE STUFF
YOU DON'T WANNA REMEMBER.

21:33.567 --> 21:35.400
RIGHT.

21:35.433 --> 21:37.600
GREAT. THANKS.

21:37.633 --> 21:40.267
HEY, I HAVE TYPE 2 DIABETES.
PATIENT LET IT GO,

21:40.300 --> 21:42.200
AND THE INFECTION
IS IN THE BONE.

21:42.233 --> 21:45.633
I HAVE TO FIND A FIX OR CUT OFF
THE FOOT. ANYONE? ANYBODY?

21:45.667 --> 21:47.567
YOU GET TO
CUT OFF HIS FOOT? COOL.

21:47.600 --> 21:49.233
YOU THINK--NO, NOT COOL.

21:49.267 --> 21:52.133
THE PATIENT WAS NEGLECTFUL.
HE MADE A COUPLE OF BAD CALLS.

21:52.167 --> 21:54.333
I MEAN, DOES THAT MEAN
HE HAS NO HOPE?

21:54.367 --> 21:56.633
DOES THAT MEAN
HE CAN'T HAVE A DO OVER?

21:56.667 --> 21:59.167
BUT YOU GET TO CUT
THROUGH BONE AND STUFF.

21:59.200 --> 22:01.833
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BURKE NOW.
WE ARE?

22:01.867 --> 22:04.700
MM-HMM. OPERATION "BE KIND.
REWIND." NOT GOING SO WELL?

22:04.733 --> 22:06.367
(Izzie) YOU NEED TO FIX IT.

22:06.400 --> 22:09.333
'CAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE YOU GUYS
HAVE A PRETTY GOOD THING,

22:09.367 --> 22:12.133
AND PRETTY GOOD THINGS
ARE RARE AND HARD TO COME BY,

22:12.167 --> 22:14.067
UNLIKE REALLY SCREWED UP,
COMPLICATED THINGS,

22:14.100 --> 22:15.733
WHICH... SEEM TO BE
FREAKIN' EVERYWHERE.

22:15.767 --> 22:17.700
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THINGS ARE GREAT.

22:17.733 --> 22:21.500
I'M GONNA GET THINGS BACK
TO THE WAY WE WERE. WATCH ME.

22:21.533 --> 22:24.800
***

22:24.833 --> 22:27.367
(sighs) HAS JANE DOE
PICKED A FACE?

22:27.400 --> 22:29.067
(Meredith) NO, NOT YET.

22:29.067 --> 22:30.767
HOW COOL WOULD THAT BE,

22:30.800 --> 22:32.733
TO GET TO PICK YOUR OWN FACE,

22:32.767 --> 22:37.100
JUST... DISAPPEAR
AND START ALL OVER?

22:37.133 --> 22:39.433
***

22:39.467 --> 22:41.367
HOW YOU DOING?

22:41.400 --> 22:43.267
HOW AM I DOING?
I'M FREAKING OUT, ALEX.

22:43.300 --> 22:45.600
THAT'S HOW I'M DOING.
I CAN'T DO THIS.

22:45.633 --> 22:47.133
I CAN'T PICK. I CAN'T.

22:47.167 --> 22:48.800
ALL RIGHT. OKAY.

22:48.833 --> 22:53.067
UH, WELL, LET'S, UH...

22:53.100 --> 22:55.500
LET'S MEET THE CONTENDERS,
ALL RIGHT?

22:55.533 --> 22:57.500
UH, LET'S SEE.

22:57.533 --> 22:58.733
THIS...

22:58.767 --> 23:01.767
THIS IS... MAGGIE.

23:01.800 --> 23:03.300
MARRIED
HER HIGH SCHOOL SWEETHEART,

23:03.333 --> 23:05.233
HAS TWO KIDS--
BOY AND GIRL.

23:05.267 --> 23:06.600
LOVES BEING A MOM,

23:06.633 --> 23:08.633
COACHES HER DAUGHTER'S
BASKETBALL TEAM

23:08.667 --> 23:12.133
AND MAKES AN INSANE
BANANA CREAM PIE.

23:12.167 --> 23:13.467
BANANA CREAM PIE?

23:13.500 --> 23:15.667
IT'S MY FAVORITE,
SO SHUT UP.

23:15.700 --> 23:18.533
AND THIS IS...

23:18.567 --> 23:19.733
UM... ELIZABETH.

23:19.767 --> 23:21.433
GRADUATED FROM NORTHWESTERN.

23:21.467 --> 23:23.500
MET HER HUSBAND
AT A POLITICAL RALLY

23:23.533 --> 23:26.433
WHERE THEY GOT ARRESTED
AND FELL IN LOVE.

23:26.467 --> 23:28.300
SHE'S ALL ANGRY AND FIRED UP,

23:28.333 --> 23:30.667
BUT EVERYONE FORGIVES HER
BECAUSE SHE MEANS WELL.

23:30.700 --> 23:33.267
AHH... WOW.

23:33.300 --> 23:35.167
THIS ONE...

23:35.200 --> 23:37.733
THIS ONE'S AVA.

23:37.767 --> 23:40.300
SHE'S FUNNY, SHE'S TOUGH,

23:40.333 --> 23:42.533
YOU KNOW,
LITTLE NEUROTIC SOMETIMES,

23:42.567 --> 23:44.467
BUT YOU GET USED TO IT.

23:44.500 --> 23:47.433
YOU CAN TELL SHE'S--SHE'S
BEEN THROUGH A LOT IN HER LIFE,

23:47.467 --> 23:50.600
BUT IT'S ONLY
MADE HER STRONGER, YOU KNOW?

23:57.067 --> 23:58.767
(bell rings)

23:58.800 --> 24:00.800
IT'S JUST, YOUR DAUGHTER,
THE WAY SHE...

24:00.833 --> 24:02.733
YOU KNOW,
SHE'S SORT OF UNDENIABLE.

24:02.767 --> 24:05.700
AND, UH,
AFTER I LOST MY FATHER,

24:05.733 --> 24:09.433
I REALIZED, YOU KNOW,
THAT LIFE IS SHORT.

24:09.467 --> 24:12.833
AND IT'S--IT'S LONG, TOO...

24:12.867 --> 24:15.467
SHORT AND LONG.

24:15.500 --> 24:18.200
LIFE...

24:18.233 --> 24:20.067
HE TALKS A LOT.

24:20.067 --> 24:21.800
NO, NO.
HE--HE--HE TALKS.

24:21.833 --> 24:24.733
LIKE A--LIKE A--
LIKE A PERSON WHO TALKS, DAD.

24:24.767 --> 24:28.100
PLEASE.
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT
YOU'VE DONE TO YOUR MOTHER?

24:28.133 --> 24:31.500
YOU MAKE THIS DECISION, THE MOST
IMPORTANT DAY OF YOUR LIFE...

24:31.533 --> 24:33.433
WE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
SHE WAS SEEING SOMEONE.

24:33.467 --> 24:35.333
ARE YOU PREGNANT?
OH...

24:35.367 --> 24:37.333
DID YOU GET
MY DAUGHTER PREGNANT?
NO.

24:37.367 --> 24:39.633
NO. DADDY, NO, IT IS NOT--
HMM?

24:39.667 --> 24:41.200
NO. THIS IS GEORGE, OKAY?

24:41.233 --> 24:43.133
HE'S NOT LIKE THE OTHER GUYS
I'VE BEEN WITH.

24:43.167 --> 24:45.800
CLEAN AS A WHISTLE,
AND A MATHLETE.

24:45.833 --> 24:48.700
HE HAS NO MONEY.
YOU HAVE MONEY.
OH, COME...

24:48.733 --> 24:50.767
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT CALLIE
WAS WELL-OFF.

24:50.800 --> 24:52.633
SHE JUST TOLD ME.
REALLY?

24:52.667 --> 24:55.100
REALLY? WELL, THEN YOU WON'T
MIND IF THE HOUSE, THE CAR

24:55.133 --> 24:56.467
AND EVERYTHING ELSE
WE'LL PROVIDE

24:56.500 --> 24:59.333
WILL BE IN CALLIOPE'S NAME.
UH, WHAT HOUSE?

24:59.367 --> 25:02.067
YOU'RE A MARRIED WOMAN NOW.
I'LL FIND SOMETHING SUITABLE.

25:02.100 --> 25:05.367
IT'S ALL HERE IN
THE POSTNUPTIAL I'VE DRAWN UP.
I'M SORRY. THE--OH, DAD!

25:05.400 --> 25:07.067
SORRY.
I'VE GOT IT.

25:07.067 --> 25:08.800
IT'S ALL RIGHT. IT'S OKAY.

25:08.833 --> 25:12.633
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU--
YOU ARE NOT DRAWING UP ANY...

25:16.867 --> 25:19.767
***

25:21.500 --> 25:23.633
...SOMEWHERE YOU CAN
RAISE A FAMILY.
NO.

25:23.667 --> 25:26.167
WHAT?
NO, THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

25:26.200 --> 25:28.200
***

25:28.233 --> 25:31.300
THERE'S NO WAY I'M GONNA

I CAN'T--WE CAN'T, UH...
CALLIE, I'M SO SORRY.

25:33.700 --> 25:36.200
MR. TORRES, I'M SORRY,
BUT THE ANSWER IS NO.

26:47.167 --> 26:48.633
WOW.

26:48.667 --> 26:51.067
THAT'S REALLY COMING ALONG.
IT LOOKS GREAT.

26:51.100 --> 26:52.833
THANKS. WE'VE BEEN
WORKING ON IT FOR MONTHS.

26:52.867 --> 26:54.733
BUT WHEN I SAY "WE,"
I MEAN "SHE."

26:54.767 --> 26:56.667
I JUST HOLD THINGS
AND LOOK PRETTY.

26:56.700 --> 26:58.600
(chuckles) THAT CAN BE
HARD WORK, TOO.

26:58.633 --> 27:00.533
I'M GONNA NEED TO DRAW
SOME BLOOD

27:00.567 --> 27:02.300
FOR, UH, YOUR SURGERY.

27:02.333 --> 27:03.500
(Nina) MM-HMM. BE CAREFUL.

27:03.533 --> 27:06.133
YOU CAN ONLY USE
ONE SPECIFIC VEIN

27:06.167 --> 27:08.533
IN THIS AREA HERE.

27:08.567 --> 27:10.200
OKAY. OH!

27:10.233 --> 27:12.267
I SAID BE CAREFUL.
I'M SO SORRY.

27:12.300 --> 27:14.200
THAT'S OKAY.
NO, IT'S NOT.

27:14.233 --> 27:16.767
IF SHE'S GONNA BE THAT CLUMSY,
SHE'S NOT DRAWING YOUR BLOOD.

27:16.800 --> 27:18.700
NINA, SHE'S JUST DOING
HER JOB.
NOT VERY WELL.

27:18.733 --> 27:21.433
I'M GOING TO GET A NURSE,
A SENIOR NURSE.
OH, NINA, STOP.

27:21.467 --> 27:23.567
NO, MOM.
DO NOT LET HER TOUCH YOU.

27:23.600 --> 27:26.633
WE CAN'T BE TOO CAREFUL.
YOU'RE NOT TAKING HER BLOOD.

27:29.567 --> 27:31.467
SHE'S NOT EVEN
A PERSON ANYMORE.

27:31.500 --> 27:33.400
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

27:33.433 --> 27:35.600
MRS. ROGERSON--

27:35.633 --> 27:36.800
I KNOW I'M GONNA DIE.

27:36.833 --> 27:39.700
YOU KNOW, MAYBE NOT TODAY,
BUT SOON.

27:39.733 --> 27:42.733
I JUST NEED TO TALK,
YOU KNOW?

27:42.767 --> 27:46.600
NINA WON'T LET ME TALK.

27:46.633 --> 27:51.333
I JUST NEED TO TALK.

27:53.500 --> 27:55.400
NO COFFEE.

27:55.433 --> 27:57.100
OH, YEAH.

27:57.133 --> 27:59.800
ONE MORE THING
FOR MARLOWE TO TWEAK.
(laughs)

27:59.833 --> 28:01.833
PLEASE TELL ME
YOU'RE NOT COMING UP

28:01.867 --> 28:03.800
WITH A 10-YEAR PLAN
FOR THIS HOSPITAL.

28:03.833 --> 28:06.700
YOU CAN COME UP WITH
ALL THE PLANS YOU WANT,

28:06.733 --> 28:08.467
BUT IN THE END, IT JUST...

28:08.500 --> 28:10.400
DOESN'T MAKE
ONE BIT OF DIFFERENCE.

28:10.433 --> 28:12.100
THINGS HAPPEN. PEOPLE JUST--

28:12.133 --> 28:13.300
DROWN?

28:13.333 --> 28:15.200
(sighs)

28:15.233 --> 28:18.100
YEAH, YOU KNOW, WHEN I
PULLED HER OUT OF THE WATER,

28:18.133 --> 28:22.167
IT WAS...
SHE WAS LIKE ICE.

28:23.800 --> 28:25.733
SHE CAN SWIM.

28:25.767 --> 28:28.700
RICHARD, SHE'S...

28:28.733 --> 28:30.733
SHE GAVE UP.

28:30.767 --> 28:32.667
I CLOSE MY EYES FOR A MOMENT,

28:32.700 --> 28:35.167
IT'S LIKE
SHE'S BACK IN THE WATER.

28:35.200 --> 28:38.067
I'M UP, AND I JUST LISTEN
TO HER BREATHE, YOU KNOW?

28:38.100 --> 28:41.200
JUST... IN CASE SHE STOPS.

28:41.233 --> 28:46.067
SO I CAN COME UP WITH PLANS
FOR THE HOSPITAL, BUT...

28:46.067 --> 28:50.100
BUT IF THEY ASK ME WHERE
I'M GONNA BE IN TEN YEARS...

28:52.833 --> 28:55.533
(Mr. Torres) GEORGE.

28:58.500 --> 29:00.600
MR. TORRES.

29:02.400 --> 29:07.133
YOU WANT TO TAKE CARE OF HER
IN YOUR OWN WAY. HMM?

29:07.167 --> 29:09.733
I UNDERSTAND THAT.
I RESPECT IT.

29:09.767 --> 29:11.567
BUT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND,

29:11.600 --> 29:13.833
SHE'S MY ONLY LITTLE GIRL,
GEORGE.

29:13.867 --> 29:15.767
AND YOU NEED TO PROMISE ME

29:15.800 --> 29:17.700
THAT YOU WILL LOVE HER
AND PROTECT HER,

29:17.733 --> 29:20.500
BECAUSE THE MINUTE
THAT YOU HURT HER...

29:20.533 --> 29:23.333
(lowers voice)
YOU UNDERSTAND?

29:23.367 --> 29:24.433
(normal voice) GOOD.
(clears throat)

29:24.467 --> 29:27.433
THEN I'LL TELL CALLIE'S MOTHER
SHE CAN PLAN THE PARTY.

29:27.467 --> 29:29.367
WHAT PA--WHAT?
YOUR WEDDING PARTY.

29:29.400 --> 29:31.333
OH, DAD, COME ON.
OH, NO, PLEASE, MIJA.

29:31.367 --> 29:34.133
FOR MY SANITY, MIJA,
JUST LET HER PLAN A PARTY.

29:34.167 --> 29:36.367
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
OKAY.

29:36.400 --> 29:38.767
ALL RIGHT.
I HAVE A PLANE TO CATCH.

29:38.800 --> 29:41.367
COME HERE.

29:41.400 --> 29:44.433
GEORGE.

29:44.467 --> 29:47.200
BYE, DAD.

29:47.233 --> 29:48.267
(sighs)

29:48.300 --> 29:50.200
(laughs)

29:50.233 --> 29:53.167
YOU STOOD UP TO HIM.
NOBODY DOES THAT.

29:53.200 --> 29:55.133
I WAS ALL PROUD.

29:57.467 --> 29:58.700
SO LISTEN...

29:58.733 --> 30:00.400
(sighs) ABOUT LAST NIGHT,

30:00.433 --> 30:02.333
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,
BUT PERSONALLY,

30:02.367 --> 30:04.467
I'D LIKE TO TAKE BACK
ABOUT 90% OF IT.

30:04.500 --> 30:05.633
ME, TOO.

30:05.667 --> 30:07.300
GOOD. GOOD. OKAY.
THEN GO--

30:07.333 --> 30:09.233
GO FIND IZZIE AND HELP HER
PREP MRS. ROGERSON.

30:09.267 --> 30:11.333
I'LL SEE YOU IN SURGERY.

30:17.133 --> 30:19.167
YOU HERE
TO KEEP MY BABY ALIVE?

30:19.200 --> 30:21.100
I AM.

30:21.133 --> 30:23.667
GOOD.

30:23.700 --> 30:25.667
SO?

30:25.700 --> 30:27.733
SO...

30:27.767 --> 30:30.200
CALL ME AVA.

30:32.200 --> 30:33.367
YOU BEEN PRACTICING?

30:33.400 --> 30:35.300
YOU KNOW THE CHIEF
WILL BE WATCHING TODAY.

30:35.333 --> 30:37.400
THE CHIEF.
RIGHT. OF COURSE.

30:37.433 --> 30:39.100
"OF COURSE" WHAT?

30:39.133 --> 30:41.567
DEREK WAS RIGHT ABOUT YOU.

30:41.600 --> 30:43.733
YOU'RE USING THE MEMORY
OF MY DEAD MOTHER

30:43.767 --> 30:46.133
TO WIN POINTS WITH THE CHIEF.

30:46.167 --> 30:47.667
IT'S DESPICABLE,

30:47.700 --> 30:49.033
AND I'M NOT GONNA PLAY.

30:49.067 --> 30:50.467
THE CHIEF--

30:50.500 --> 30:53.167
THE WAY HE WAS LOOKING
AT YOU THIS MORNING--

30:53.200 --> 30:55.100
WAS LIKE YOU WERE SOME
BEATEN DOWN PUPPY

30:55.133 --> 30:57.033
HE PICKED UP
OFF THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.

30:57.067 --> 31:00.100
YOU DO THIS PROCEDURE
AND YOU DO IT WELL,

31:00.133 --> 31:03.133
HE'LL START LOOKING AT YOU
LIKE A SURGEON AGAIN.

31:03.167 --> 31:05.533
BUT, YOU KNOW...

31:05.567 --> 31:07.467
YOU WANNA THINK OF ME
AS DESPICABLE,

31:07.500 --> 31:10.633
YOU WANNA PASS UP THIS SHOT,
THAT'S UP TO YOU.

31:22.200 --> 31:27.100
THEY'RE DOING A-AMAZING THINGS
WITH PROSTHETICS THESE DAYS.

31:27.133 --> 31:30.233
THIS DOESN'T MEAN
YOUR LIFE IS OVER.

31:33.633 --> 31:37.567
UH, TAKE HIM UP TO THE O.R.
I'LL MEET YOU THERE.

31:44.300 --> 31:46.200
YOU'VE GOT
YOUR BOARD THING NOW?

31:48.367 --> 31:51.767
THE CHIEF PICKED YOU...
ORIGINALLY.

31:51.800 --> 31:54.400
YOU WERE ALWAYS SUPPOSED TO BE
THE NEXT CHIEF.

31:54.433 --> 31:55.600
THAT WAS THE PLAN.

31:55.633 --> 31:58.500
THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.
A LOT HAS HAPPENED SINCE THEN.

31:58.533 --> 32:01.700
BUT YOU'RE STILL THAT GUY.
YOU'RE THE GUY THE CHIEF CHOSE.

32:01.733 --> 32:03.800
NO, I'M NOT.

32:03.833 --> 32:07.100
I'M NOT THAT GUY, CRISTINA,
AND I WOULDN'T WANT TO BE.

32:07.133 --> 32:09.600
I WANT TO BE BETTER
THAN THAT.

32:09.633 --> 32:12.633
I'D LIKE TO BELIEVE
THAT I'VE GROWN.

32:12.667 --> 32:13.833
I WANT TO MOVE FORWARD.

32:13.867 --> 32:16.500
I'M NOT INTERESTED
IN GOING BACK.

32:18.533 --> 32:20.600
DR. BURKE.

32:32.167 --> 32:34.267
YOU READY?

32:34.300 --> 32:37.600
OSTEOTOME AND HAMMER.

32:37.633 --> 32:39.533
ALL RIGHT,
USE THE CURVED OSTEOTOME

32:39.567 --> 32:40.733
TO ELEVATE
THE EXTERNAL TABLE.

32:40.767 --> 32:43.233
GENTLY.

32:45.667 --> 32:48.567
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

32:50.233 --> 32:51.733
(Preston) HOW'S IT LOOKING?

32:51.767 --> 32:52.767
(George) STILL SEE BLEEDING.

32:52.800 --> 32:56.067
THE PLATINUM MICROCOILS--
THEY AREN'T HOLDING.

32:56.100 --> 32:57.833
WHAT ABOUT USING
A GELATIN SPONGE?

32:57.867 --> 32:59.533
I'VE ALREADY
TRIED POLYVINYL ALCOHOL,

32:59.567 --> 33:00.733
GLUE, MICROCOILS--
NOTHING'S WORKING.

33:00.767 --> 33:03.067
(monitor beeps)
B.P.'s DROPPING
TO 62 SYSTOLIC.

33:03.100 --> 33:05.533
(Preston) WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO OPEN HER UP.

33:05.567 --> 33:07.433
IF YOU OPEN HER UP,
SHE'S DEAD.

33:07.467 --> 33:10.367
IF WE DON'T, SHE'S DEAD.

33:10.400 --> 33:13.300
***

33:19.100 --> 33:21.233
(saw whirring)

33:21.267 --> 33:24.100
BEGINNING AMPUTATION.

33:24.133 --> 33:27.067
***

33:32.767 --> 33:35.633
(monitor beeping erratically)

33:35.667 --> 33:38.567

33:41.667 --> 33:45.500
(Miranda)
FINE AMPUTATION, YANG.

33:45.533 --> 33:48.433
***

33:51.867 --> 33:54.733
BEAUTIFUL.

33:54.767 --> 33:57.667

continuous tone)

34:14.067 --> 34:16.800

34:19.567 --> 34:22.067
***

34:25.800 --> 34:28.267
(Addison) WAIT.
NOW THEY'RE LAUGHING.

34:28.300 --> 34:30.267
LAUGHING?
THEY'RE LAUGHING.

34:30.300 --> 34:32.100
WELL, THEY CAN'T BE
LAUGHING WITH HIM.

34:32.133 --> 34:34.067
THEY HAVE TO BE
LAUGHING AT HIM.

34:34.067 --> 34:35.567
I'M SURPRISED YOU DON'T HAVE

34:35.600 --> 34:37.500
A SHOT GLASS PRESSED UP
AGAINST THAT WINDOW.

34:37.533 --> 34:39.433
WE WEREN'T LISTENING.
(Preston) JUST LISTENING.

34:39.467 --> 34:41.700
(Addison) WE WEREN'T
EAVESDROPPING.

34:41.733 --> 34:43.633
(Mark) LET ME
SHOW YOU THE NEW CLINIC.

34:43.667 --> 34:46.833
HEY, CHIEF.

34:46.867 --> 34:48.067
SO?

34:48.100 --> 34:50.367
IF YOU ASK ME,
YOU ALL COULD STAND

34:50.400 --> 34:52.633
TO BORROW A PAGE
FROM DR. SLOAN'S BOOK.

34:52.667 --> 34:55.133
SLOAN? (laughs)
YOU'RE KIDDING RIGHT?

34:55.167 --> 34:56.400
THAT'S A JOKE?

34:56.433 --> 34:59.467
HE DIDN'T GET CAUGHT UP IN THIS
WHOLE 10-YEAR PLAN FOOLISHNESS.

34:59.500 --> 35:01.333
HE SAID HE HAD
A "RIGHT NOW" PLAN

35:01.367 --> 35:03.267
FOR SEATTLE GRACE.
A RIGHT NOW PLAN?

35:03.300 --> 35:05.533
A RIGHT NOW PLAN?

35:05.567 --> 35:07.100
IS THAT RIGHT?

35:07.133 --> 35:08.567
THE BOARD ATE IT UP.

35:08.600 --> 35:11.500
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,
SO DID I.

35:18.300 --> 35:21.667
I SHOULD'VE
BROUGHT HER IN SOONER...

35:21.700 --> 35:25.367
THE FIRST TIME SHE THREW UP.

35:25.400 --> 35:27.300
I KNEW BETTER.

35:27.333 --> 35:29.633
NINA, THERE WAS NOTHING
ANY OF US COULD--

35:29.667 --> 35:31.267
NO.

35:31.300 --> 35:34.067
IT WAS A MISTAKE.

35:35.800 --> 35:37.733
YOUR MOTHER...

35:37.767 --> 35:40.733
TALKED TO ME.

35:40.767 --> 35:42.633
SHE WASN'T READY TO LEAVE YOU,

35:42.667 --> 35:45.367
BUT SHE WAS READY
TO LEAVE HER BODY.

35:45.400 --> 35:47.300
PLEASE. I DON'T NEED YOU
TO EXPLAIN

35:47.333 --> 35:49.367
THE RELATIVE COMFORTS
OF DEATH FOR MY MOTHER.

35:52.633 --> 35:55.533
WHAT SHE WAS AFRAID OF
WAS THAT YOU HAD TAKEN ON

35:55.567 --> 35:59.600
SO MUCH OF HER DISEASE
THAT YOU WERE FREEZING UP, TOO.

35:59.633 --> 36:03.167
YOU'VE SPENT SO MUCH TIME
PLANNING AND...

36:03.200 --> 36:04.533
HELPING HER AVOID RISK--

36:04.567 --> 36:06.433
GOD KNOWS, THAT'S WHAT
YOU SHOULD'VE BEEN DOING--

36:06.467 --> 36:08.633
BUT...

36:08.667 --> 36:10.833
SHE WAS WORRIED.

36:10.867 --> 36:12.767
YOU HAVE A HEALTHY BODY, NINA.

36:12.800 --> 36:17.533
IF YOU FALL DOWN,
YOU WON'T TURN TO STONE.

36:17.567 --> 36:19.433
AND YOUR MOM SO WANTED YOU

36:19.467 --> 36:22.233
TO JUST LET YOURSELF FALL.

36:23.800 --> 36:25.700
MESSING UP...

36:25.733 --> 36:28.533
IT'S WHAT MAKES A PERSON.

36:28.567 --> 36:30.800
IT'S HOW WE LEARN...

36:30.833 --> 36:33.500
WHERE WE FIND JOY--

36:33.533 --> 36:38.200
IN THE THINGS
YOU DON'T PLAN FOR,

36:38.233 --> 36:40.800
THE THINGS
YOU NEVER SEE COMING.

36:47.767 --> 36:49.533
OKAY.

36:49.567 --> 36:51.800
IT HAPPENED.

36:51.833 --> 36:54.300
IT WAS A MISTAKE,
AND IT HAPPENED.

36:54.333 --> 36:56.533
PEOPLE MAKE MISTAKES.

36:56.567 --> 36:59.433
WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT
WHERE WE GO FROM HERE.

36:59.467 --> 37:01.600
WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT
HOW TO TELL CALLIE.

37:01.633 --> 37:03.533
I'M NOT GONNA TELL CALLIE.

37:03.567 --> 37:06.433
DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
THIS WOULD HURT HER?

37:06.467 --> 37:09.100
I'M NOT GONNA CLEAR
MY CONSCIENCE AT HER EXPENSE.

37:09.133 --> 37:10.833
SHE HAS DONE NOTHING
BUT SUPPORT ME,

37:10.867 --> 37:12.767
ENCOURAGE ME
AND BELIEVE IN ME,

37:12.800 --> 37:14.733
AND THIS IS HOW
I PAY HER BACK?

37:16.500 --> 37:19.500
NO, I HAVE TO LIVE
WITH WHAT I DID.

37:19.533 --> 37:21.733
THIS IS OUR SECRET, OKAY?

37:23.733 --> 37:25.533
OKAY.

37:25.567 --> 37:28.333
THE THING ABOUT PLANS IS,

37:28.367 --> 37:32.333
THEY DON'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT
THE UNEXPECTED.

37:32.367 --> 37:34.233
SO WHEN WE'RE THROWN
A CURVEBALL

37:34.267 --> 37:39.333
WHETHER IT'S IN THE O.R.
OR IN LIFE...

37:39.367 --> 37:41.433
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

37:41.467 --> 37:42.800
WE HAVE TO IMPROVISE.

37:42.833 --> 37:45.600
I'M A GUY WITHOUT A FOOT.

37:45.633 --> 37:48.300
WHAT DO I DO NOW?

37:48.333 --> 37:49.800
YOU MOVE FORWARD,

37:49.833 --> 37:51.733
YOU... YOU FOLLOW THE PLAN,

37:51.767 --> 37:54.267
AND YOU TRY AND KEEP
YOUR OTHER FOOT.

37:55.867 --> 37:58.733
MY OTHER FOOT.

37:58.767 --> 38:00.800
RIGHT.

38:02.833 --> 38:08.633
OF COURSE, SOME OF US
ARE BETTER AT IT THAN OTHERS.

38:08.667 --> 38:12.467
(footsteps approach)

38:12.500 --> 38:15.067
I'M IMPRESSED, KAREV.

38:15.100 --> 38:17.400
YOU SPENT THE WHOLE DAY
WATCHING A FETAL MONITOR

38:17.433 --> 38:19.300
AND NEVER COMPLAINED.

38:19.333 --> 38:21.633
WELL, I, UH,
I DO WHAT I'M TOLD.

38:21.667 --> 38:24.067
SINCE WHEN?

38:24.067 --> 38:26.067
DEPENDS ON WHO'S DOING
THE TELLING.

38:26.100 --> 38:27.667
(laughs)

38:27.700 --> 38:29.767
GOOD NIGHT, DR. KAREV.

38:29.800 --> 38:33.300

38:33.333 --> 38:35.400
WHAT WAS THAT?

MM. I DON'T THINK I'M GONNA
KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT

38:41.367 --> 38:42.733
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

38:42.767 --> 38:46.600
WHAT DO YOU SAY WE TALK ABOUT
YOU AND THE REDHEAD INSTEAD?

38:46.633 --> 38:50.300
WELL, THE REDHEAD'S MY BOSS,
SO...

38:50.333 --> 38:51.433
SO?

38:51.467 --> 38:53.333
(laughs)
SO IT'S COMPLICATED.

38:53.367 --> 38:54.400
AND?

38:54.433 --> 38:55.600
AND... (laughs)

38:55.633 --> 38:58.500
***

38:58.533 --> 39:02.433
SOME OF US JUST HAVE TO
MOVE ON TO PLAN B...

39:02.467 --> 39:04.267

39:04.300 --> 39:07.767
AND MAKE THE BEST OF IT.

39:07.800 --> 39:10.600
MM-HMM.

(sighs)

39:12.500 --> 39:15.400
***

39:17.667 --> 39:20.133
IT HAS TO BE SMALL--

JUST YOU AND ME...

39:22.767 --> 39:24.100
AND MEREDITH...

39:24.133 --> 39:26.333
AND--AND SHEPHERD, TOO,
IF YOU WANT.

39:26.367 --> 39:28.267
BUT THAT'S IT.

39:28.300 --> 39:30.200

39:30.233 --> 39:32.767

SPIRITUAL AND STUFF,

39:34.733 --> 39:37.600
BUT I-I DON'T WANT
ANY RABBIS OR MINISTERS,

39:37.633 --> 39:39.533
NOTHING RELIGIOUS.

39:39.567 --> 39:42.300
WE'LL JUST...

39:42.333 --> 39:44.233
MAKE AN APPOINTMENT
AT CITY HALL,

39:44.267 --> 39:46.267
AND THAT'LL BE THAT.

39:46.300 --> 39:48.233
AND NO VEIL. OKAY?

39:48.267 --> 39:50.167
I DON'T WANT TO GET MARRIED

39:50.200 --> 39:52.600
WITH MOSQUITO NET
ALL OVER MY FACE.

WHAT'S WEIRD?

40:14.300 --> 40:16.500
IT'S EXACTLY
WHAT SHE WOULD HAVE WANTED.

OKAY.

40:29.567 --> 40:32.133
IT WASN'T GREAT.

40:32.167 --> 40:34.067
I WAS DISTRACTED.
(clears throat)

40:34.100 --> 40:37.233
BY WHAT?

40:37.267 --> 40:39.167
NOTHING.

40:40.533 --> 40:43.367
I DON'T KNOW.

40:43.400 --> 40:46.800
ON A SCALE OF ONE TO TEN,
HOW BAD IS IT?

40:46.833 --> 40:50.267
EIGHT.

40:52.533 --> 40:54.467
HOW ABOUT NOW?

40:54.500 --> 40:57.267
SEVEN.

40:57.300 --> 40:59.633
AND SOMETIMES...

40:59.667 --> 41:02.067
HOW ABOUT NOW?

41:02.100 --> 41:05.100
SIX.
WHAT WE WANT...

41:05.133 --> 41:06.333
FIVE.

41:06.367 --> 41:07.800
IS EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED.

41:07.833 --> 41:09.233
FOUR, THREE...

41:09.267 --> 41:12.167
***

41:24.200 --> 41:27.067
BUT SOMETIMES...

41:27.100 --> 41:30.500
(sobs)

41:35.200 --> 41:37.600
***

41:37.633 --> 41:40.500
I CAN SMELL YOUR CLOTHES
THROUGH THE CLOSET DOOR.

41:40.533 --> 41:43.400
DID YOU TIE THEM UP
IN A PLASTIC LAUNDRY BAG?

41:43.433 --> 41:44.367
YEAH.

41:44.400 --> 41:46.100
(sighs)

41:46.133 --> 41:50.333
I'M SORRY.

41:50.367 --> 41:51.833
(sighs)

41:51.867 --> 41:54.333
I'M--I'M SO SORRY.

41:54.367 --> 41:57.633
WELL, I GUESS I CAN...
LIVE WITH IT.

41:57.667 --> 41:59.433
MM.

41:59.467 --> 42:04.267
SOMETIMES WHAT WE NEED
IS A NEW PLAN.
