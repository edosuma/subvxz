[theme music playing]

00:14.933 --> 00:17.101
[Maria] <i>I'm a pterodactyl.</i>

00:20.939 --> 00:22.065
[Bruce playing drums] Da, da.

00:22.148 --> 00:24.776
Da, da... Daddy never loved me.

00:24.859 --> 00:26.653
-Da, da, da...
-[knocking]

00:26.736 --> 00:28.071
-Maria. [chuckling]
-Hey.

00:28.154 --> 00:30.114
To what do I owe this gorgeous surprise?

00:30.198 --> 00:32.992
Well, I've just come in
to pick up my check.

00:33.076 --> 00:35.328
Ah! That's strange.

00:35.411 --> 00:37.080
You should have received that moons ago.

00:37.163 --> 00:39.457
I don't mean to bug you
about the money...

00:39.541 --> 00:40.917
it's just tight right now.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.711
If you hadn't slept through
the table read of <i>Ghostbrides,</i>

00:43.795 --> 00:45.129
you'd have two checks.

00:45.213 --> 00:46.214
[groaning]

00:49.133 --> 00:51.344
We do have a point of order number two,

00:51.427 --> 00:54.430
I need $10,000 to secure a table
for you and yours

00:54.514 --> 00:56.099
at my Touch the Children benefit.

00:56.182 --> 00:58.268
I just told you,
I don't have any money.

00:58.351 --> 00:59.769
They don't have any parents.

00:59.852 --> 01:02.730
Here comes one right now.
His parents died in a fire.

01:02.814 --> 01:05.358
Jalen, what did I tell you
about the paper cups?

01:05.441 --> 01:06.818
They don't respect the earth.

01:06.901 --> 01:09.404
It's like a tamale husk.
They just throw it away.

01:09.487 --> 01:11.114
Should I get another one?

01:11.197 --> 01:13.324
No. That's fine. I'll deal with it.

01:14.200 --> 01:16.869
You know, instead of making
a monetary contribution,

01:16.953 --> 01:19.747
perhaps you could delight the little ones

01:19.831 --> 01:23.459
with a performance of your...
your charming comedic gibberish.

01:23.543 --> 01:25.336
Bruce, I can't do a benefit for kids.

01:25.420 --> 01:30.049
I adore children in concept,
but they hate me in reality.

01:30.133 --> 01:31.384
Let me demonstrate.

01:31.467 --> 01:33.011
Hello, Admiral.

01:34.012 --> 01:35.388
What do you enjoy?

01:35.471 --> 01:37.890
Do you have sports or...

01:37.974 --> 01:39.684
[inhales deeply]

01:39.767 --> 01:40.977
[razzes]

01:41.060 --> 01:43.730
[inhales deeply and blows raspberry]

01:45.481 --> 01:46.608
See, it's happening.

01:46.691 --> 01:49.319
I'm not all that crazy about them myself.

01:49.402 --> 01:54.449
Look, I choose to do good
in the world in my daily life.

01:54.532 --> 01:55.742
One-on-one.

01:55.825 --> 01:57.452
Your picture's in the brochure.

01:57.535 --> 01:59.037
Goddamn it, Bruce.

01:59.120 --> 02:02.040
I know.
Listen, I owe you big time, no question.

02:02.123 --> 02:05.710
[sighs] Fine, I'll do it...
but I am not happy.

02:05.793 --> 02:08.463
Are any of us... really?

02:08.545 --> 02:09.714
[softly] Goddamn it.

02:13.468 --> 02:16.262
Think it's cool to fuck up my shit?
I'll fuck up yours.

02:16.346 --> 02:17.555
Hey. What's goin' on?

02:17.639 --> 02:19.098
See what this fucker did?

02:19.182 --> 02:22.769
Oh, you have quite the eye, Josue.

02:22.852 --> 02:25.229
Strong, bold strokes.
I'll take it from here.

02:25.355 --> 02:27.231
-Fuck you will! I'm gonna fuck him up!
-Stop!

02:27.315 --> 02:30.693
Lieutenant Maria Bamford, graffiti squad.
Undercover.

02:30.777 --> 02:32.487
That was a picture of a dog.

02:32.570 --> 02:34.739
K-9 Division. Good collar, sir.

02:34.822 --> 02:37.116
I'll see that the mayor hears about this.

02:37.200 --> 02:38.993
Uh... run!

02:42.497 --> 02:43.915
[Maria] I don't know if you know,

02:43.998 --> 02:46.501
<i>graffito</i> is an Italian word
that means "scribble."

02:46.584 --> 02:49.045
Hey, what do you want with me?

02:49.128 --> 02:51.923
I don't believe in organized charities.
One-on-one...

02:52.006 --> 02:54.967
like, that's where change happens,
and I think...

02:55.051 --> 02:56.886
maybe I could help you to change.

02:56.969 --> 02:58.888
Oh, I get it.

02:58.971 --> 03:01.224
White lady wants to help
the brown kid in the <i>barrio</i>.

03:01.307 --> 03:03.893
Your enthusiasm will go away
after a month.

03:03.976 --> 03:05.686
How about we save ourselves the trouble,

03:05.770 --> 03:07.772
and say our goodbyes right now.

03:07.855 --> 03:10.024
Okay, <i>Blind Side? </i> Thanks for lunch.

03:10.108 --> 03:12.443
Oh, no. But I'm... I'm invested.

03:12.527 --> 03:14.445
Please. You look bored already.

03:14.529 --> 03:16.906
No. I'm just anxious. You make me nervous.

03:16.989 --> 03:18.783
-Brown skin makes you nervous?
-No.

03:18.866 --> 03:23.287
Young skin makes me nervous.
Young skin covering bones and brains.

03:23.371 --> 03:27.542
Can I ask you a question?
Do you hate me?

03:27.625 --> 03:29.168
I think you're fucked up...

03:30.002 --> 03:33.256
-but I don't hate you.
-All right. That's a first.

03:33.339 --> 03:38.094
So, Josue, I have to do a comedy show
for a group of orphans.

03:38.177 --> 03:41.347
Could you teach me
how to touch the children

03:41.431 --> 03:43.474
so that I don't bomb at the benefit?

03:43.558 --> 03:45.518
Yeah, but it'll cost you.

03:45.601 --> 03:49.063
[sighing] Yeah, I'm tapped.
I don't have any money.

03:49.147 --> 03:51.357
-I wish you took credit.
-I take cards.

03:51.441 --> 03:53.317
What? Oh, great.

03:53.401 --> 03:54.527
Swipe.

03:55.403 --> 03:56.529
Josue!

03:58.448 --> 04:01.033
Hey, Bruce. Hey, Jalen.

04:01.117 --> 04:04.954
Hey. Well,
who is this strapping young gaucho?

04:05.037 --> 04:06.706
This is my friend, Josue.

04:06.789 --> 04:07.999
Ah, how do you do?

04:08.082 --> 04:11.002
Bruce Ben-Bacharach.
Artist to Artist Management.

04:11.085 --> 04:13.421
You're that guy
that doesn't send Maria her checks.

04:13.504 --> 04:16.048
Zing. This one's got a bit of a mouth
on him.

04:16.798 --> 04:19.385
So tell me, Maria.
What exactly is going on?

04:19.469 --> 04:22.137
You hired a street tough to shake me down?

04:22.221 --> 04:24.307
[chuckling] Just kidding. Or am I?

04:24.390 --> 04:26.726
He's helping me. I'm his charity.

04:26.809 --> 04:28.936
He's teaching me to be myself around kids.

04:29.020 --> 04:31.063
So I don't bomb at the benefit.

04:31.147 --> 04:33.816
-Oh.
-I'm her mentor, and she's mental.

04:33.900 --> 04:36.736
-[all laughing]
-Oh, we're having the best time.

04:36.819 --> 04:38.404
-Splendid.
-[Maria] Mmm-hmm.

04:41.073 --> 04:43.159
[in cowboy voice]
How you doin', cowboy?

04:45.286 --> 04:47.914
-[in normal voice] How was that?
-That was great.

04:51.042 --> 04:52.418
[in Spanish] What's up with her?

04:52.502 --> 04:53.961
[Josue] She's fucked up.

04:54.045 --> 04:55.296
What about him?

04:55.379 --> 04:56.464
He's a male prostitute.

04:57.423 --> 04:58.674
She seems crazy.

04:58.758 --> 05:00.134
You going to tap that ass?

05:00.218 --> 05:01.302
No, Jalen.

05:01.385 --> 05:03.262
Maria's a really terrific woman...

05:03.346 --> 05:05.515
who's done a lot of
work on herself.

05:05.598 --> 05:08.851
I think we stigmatize mental illness
in this country.

05:08.935 --> 05:10.353
And that's not cool.

05:11.687 --> 05:13.731
[in English] <i>Foxcatcher Babies,</i> take one.

05:15.316 --> 05:18.778
[in high-pitched voice] What's that
in your pocket, Coach? A gun?

05:18.861 --> 05:20.404
[high-pitched screaming]

05:23.699 --> 05:25.409
[in normal voice] Great material.

05:30.498 --> 05:34.669
[Maria] <i>I was feeling guilty</i>
<i>about Checklist being an evil corporation.</i>

05:35.795 --> 05:38.756

As the global spokesperson for Checklist,

05:48.975 --> 05:52.103
I want to thank you
for letting me in your classroom.

05:52.186 --> 05:55.022
Let's have a round of applause
for Checklist.

05:55.106 --> 05:58.276
And all the wonderful people at Checklist,

05:58.359 --> 06:01.862
who built an English immersion school
here in Mejico.

06:01.946 --> 06:03.489
-[all laughing]
-[Maria] Yeah!

06:03.573 --> 06:07.994
One of the many global charities
that Checklist has built and...

06:08.077 --> 06:11.581
And who doesn't love a good charity?
Anyways...

06:11.664 --> 06:14.417
Now, if I hear any of you
speaking Spanish,

06:14.500 --> 06:15.793
we're gonna have a <i>problema!</i>

06:15.876 --> 06:17.295
Ooh, slap on the wrist for me.

06:17.378 --> 06:19.755
-[all laughing]
-[Maria] I just spoke Spanish.

06:19.839 --> 06:23.092
Anyway, let's open our English workbooks

06:23.175 --> 06:25.886
and see what Trabajito is up to.

06:25.970 --> 06:27.555
Trabajito says...

06:27.638 --> 06:29.307
[imitating Trabajito] "Keep working."

06:29.390 --> 06:31.267
"When the floor manager asks...

[imitating floor manager]
'Who wants extra hours?'

06:33.686 --> 06:35.313

Trabajito always says,

06:35.438 --> 06:37.356
-'Me, sir!'
-[all laughing]

06:38.608 --> 06:42.320
When there's an accident on the floor,
Trabajito keeps his lips zipped.

06:42.403 --> 06:45.197
[in deep voice] Because his eyes
don't always see the truth

06:45.281 --> 06:48.451
and there's a floor manager
who knows better."

06:48.534 --> 06:51.704
[in normal voice] I like this guy,
he's got good hustle.

06:51.787 --> 06:53.331
Hey.

06:53.414 --> 06:56.334
What's the secret, you guys?

06:56.417 --> 06:57.835
Oh, you're so serious.

06:57.918 --> 07:00.546
I have a joke in Spanish.
It takes 12 minutes to tell.

07:00.630 --> 07:02.465
So I'm gonna give you the punchline.

07:02.548 --> 07:03.966
[in Spanish] Surprise!

07:04.050 --> 07:05.176
[all laughing]

07:07.053 --> 07:09.680
Not for everybody.
No, that's been established.

07:09.764 --> 07:11.766
My sense of humor.
All right.

07:11.849 --> 07:14.143
I'm gonna crack you two nuts.

07:14.226 --> 07:15.561
[laughing]

07:18.522 --> 07:21.484
I always have the six-inch
vegetarian sandwich at Sabuey.

07:21.567 --> 07:23.903
Six-inch vegetarian
won't even wake me up in the morning.

07:23.986 --> 07:25.154
[all laughing]

07:25.237 --> 07:28.783
Ah, you see, she make the sandwich
to seem like a penis.

07:28.866 --> 07:30.993
Ay, maybe if you put in your mouth,

07:31.077 --> 07:33.204
it will become a foot-long.

07:33.287 --> 07:36.332
Oh, artfully done, Consuela. [laughing]

07:36.415 --> 07:38.334
Home run! Everybody's laughing.

07:40.252 --> 07:43.631
Except those two. Hmm.
What is going on with them?

07:43.714 --> 07:45.049
[speaking Spanish]

07:45.132 --> 07:46.926
Hey, guys.

07:48.344 --> 07:49.512
Who died? Hmm?

-[tutting]

07:51.889 --> 07:53.224
In English.

07:53.307 --> 07:56.852
My brother. He died in an accident
on the Checklist factory floor.

07:56.936 --> 07:59.021
I'm very sorry about your brother.

07:59.146 --> 08:00.690
Thank you.

08:01.691 --> 08:04.110
-You guys want to hear a joke?
-Uh, no.

08:04.193 --> 08:06.696
[laughing] Know your crowd.

08:06.779 --> 08:08.656
Anyways, I'll see you around...

08:08.739 --> 08:12.618
and let's keep it in English.
Okay? Okay?

08:13.619 --> 08:14.662

08:14.745 --> 08:16.414
[laughing hysterically]

08:18.249 --> 08:20.626
[speaking Spanish]

08:20.710 --> 08:23.963
[in Spanish] Too many people
are dying on these factory floors.

08:24.046 --> 08:25.965
[in English] There's a barbecue or...

08:26.048 --> 08:29.552
[in Spanish]
We must organize and form a union.

08:29.635 --> 08:31.554
[in English] Excuse me, shouldn't you...

08:31.637 --> 08:34.347
be in class, speaking English?

08:34.432 --> 08:36.308
Look at this, Miss Maria. What do we do?

08:36.392 --> 08:39.770
Okay. This is Spanish. The devil papers.

08:39.854 --> 08:41.063
This doesn't concern you.

08:41.147 --> 08:42.732
-[Maria] Oh.
-Keep walking.

08:42.815 --> 08:45.026
No.

08:45.109 --> 08:48.612
Every time you speak
or write a Spanish word,

08:48.696 --> 08:53.451
you are taking a tiny inky little shovel
and digging your own graves.

08:53.534 --> 08:55.119
Your own graves!

08:56.120 --> 08:57.997
Do you know why I'm here?

08:58.748 --> 09:02.168
I'm the face of Checklist.

09:02.251 --> 09:04.879
Do you know how much they pay me?

09:04.962 --> 09:07.339
Is it the devil's money? I don't know.

09:07.423 --> 09:09.091
It is the devil's money...

09:09.175 --> 09:14.680
if I don't help you change your lives.
Change your lives.

09:15.806 --> 09:18.684
Give me those flyers. I'm doing this...

09:18.768 --> 09:21.979
I'm doing this for you.

09:22.063 --> 09:26.817
Nothing tastes as good
as speaking English feels!

09:28.527 --> 09:32.406
I know it's not easy to work hard.

09:32.490 --> 09:36.619
Sure you can make things cheap
if you speak Spanish.

09:36.702 --> 09:42.208
But if you speak English,
you can make those things even cheaper.

09:42.291 --> 09:44.210
[all laughing]

09:44.293 --> 09:47.338
And I say to those bad apples,
who almost lost their way...

09:53.761 --> 09:55.221
[crowd and Maria laughing]

09:58.891 --> 10:00.226
Sounds good.

10:00.309 --> 10:02.061
Feels right.

10:02.144 --> 10:05.731
[chanting] Sounds good.
Feels right.

10:05.815 --> 10:08.150
[all chanting] Sounds good.
Feels right.

10:08.234 --> 10:10.653
Sounds good.
Feels right.

10:10.736 --> 10:13.114
Sounds good.
Feels right.

10:13.197 --> 10:15.199
[cheering]

10:18.953 --> 10:21.789
[Trabajito over TV]

10:21.872 --> 10:24.750
<i>"Why do I need more money?"</i>

<i>Trabajito never disobeys.</i>

10:37.429 --> 10:40.474

10:48.023 --> 10:49.859
You're welcome, Mexico.

10:53.696 --> 10:56.532

10:56.615 --> 10:59.076

11:02.204 --> 11:06.125
[in pirate voice] Welcome to the
Duluth Historical Maritime Museum.

11:06.208 --> 11:09.378
The perfect location to shoot

11:09.461 --> 11:12.965
your old-timey public hangin'.

11:13.048 --> 11:17.261
Or your movie film period drama,

11:17.344 --> 11:19.555
or your television program.

11:19.638 --> 11:24.101
Or your nautically themed
advertising campaign.

11:24.184 --> 11:26.729
Or your Christian haunted house.

11:26.812 --> 11:32.776
The Duluth Film Commission would love
to sail away with your business.

11:32.860 --> 11:34.862
-Cut!
-[bell rings]

11:34.945 --> 11:37.239
Okay. Um, that was good...

11:37.323 --> 11:39.533
but you really need
to find the heart of it.

11:39.617 --> 11:42.786
You know, like you found
my heart and just ripped it out

11:42.870 --> 11:45.039
when you betrayed me
with my husband, Paul.

11:45.122 --> 11:48.042
Paul wanted to draw.

11:48.125 --> 11:51.295
I don't understand why
he can't draw and you get to direct.

11:51.378 --> 11:55.174
Because I won
a major film contest at church.

11:55.257 --> 11:57.927
Hello? Is this thing on? [chuckling]

11:58.636 --> 12:02.014
Okay, Parker Poser,
I don't want to give you a line reading...

12:02.097 --> 12:03.766
but this is how it should be read.

12:03.849 --> 12:05.392
-Okay. Props.
-[woman] Yes, ma'am.

12:05.476 --> 12:06.769
Please, to my trailer.

12:06.894 --> 12:08.771
Move it, you lazy caboose.

12:10.105 --> 12:11.440
[sighing]

12:12.358 --> 12:16.320
A razmataz-taz!
And a rootie-toot-tootie!

12:16.403 --> 12:20.491
This is the Duluth Maritime
Historical Museum.

12:20.574 --> 12:21.700
See?

12:23.202 --> 12:25.245
That felt really good, right?

12:25.329 --> 12:27.373
I'm just gonna do the next one, too.

12:27.456 --> 12:29.500
You're gonna replace me? I--

12:29.583 --> 12:30.834
But I didn't do anything wrong.

12:30.918 --> 12:34.004
Oh, now you can act. [laughing]

12:34.088 --> 12:36.548
We'll take five, and get me that wardrobe.

12:36.632 --> 12:37.925
Quick.

12:38.008 --> 12:41.637
-Mom, is it me?
-Sweetie, don't make me choose sides.

12:41.720 --> 12:44.098
You wanna build your own burrito?

12:45.015 --> 12:47.977
<i>-Yes.</i>
-<i>Take a napkin.</i>

12:48.060 --> 12:49.561

12:53.941 --> 12:55.401
[Susan] All right, buttmunchers.

12:55.484 --> 12:58.320
Let's take five from sticking
our thumbs up our keister

12:58.404 --> 13:00.280
and shoot something for criminy's sake.

13:00.364 --> 13:02.658
Come on, places, morons.

13:02.741 --> 13:05.244
[Maria] Scene One. Take Three.

13:05.327 --> 13:06.537
Action.

13:07.621 --> 13:11.208
[in British accent] It was
on this day in 1878...

13:12.459 --> 13:14.294
[Madison] Susan Carlisle Beeber,

13:14.378 --> 13:16.839
you're an awful person
and we've had it with you,

13:16.922 --> 13:18.632
As Director of Photography,

13:18.716 --> 13:23.012
I hereby relieve you of your duties
as captain of this industrial film crew.

13:23.095 --> 13:24.138
What?

13:24.221 --> 13:27.307
Oh, my goodness. Is this in the script?

13:27.391 --> 13:29.560
[Madison] You're a bully,
Susan Beeber, and...

13:29.643 --> 13:32.479
we're taking a united front
to demand that you leave.

13:32.563 --> 13:34.148
So say you all?

13:34.231 --> 13:35.941

13:41.572 --> 13:43.574
After everything I've done for you?

13:43.657 --> 13:45.492
After I saved your ass in third grade

13:45.576 --> 13:48.037
and was there for you
after all your breakups?

13:48.120 --> 13:50.748
Maria? Say it.

13:50.831 --> 13:52.708
Say it!

13:52.791 --> 13:56.378
Oh, God. What's gonna happen?

13:56.462 --> 13:58.797
You guys are so mean.

13:58.881 --> 14:00.591
You...

14:00.674 --> 14:03.343
You and you.

14:03.427 --> 14:05.220
And you? [scoffing]

14:06.513 --> 14:07.514
You're mean.

14:09.058 --> 14:10.601
I can frig off.

14:11.935 --> 14:14.313
Yeah, I can frigging frig right off.

14:14.438 --> 14:19.443
But I'm not gonna leave...
until I hear it from Maria.

14:19.526 --> 14:21.779
So, Maria...

14:21.862 --> 14:24.198
you want me to frig off?

I think you're doing a great job.

-[crying softly]
-And I don't want you to frig off.

Yeah, get off my set. Get out!

14:58.148 --> 15:00.275
Yeah, especially you, fatty Maddie.

15:00.359 --> 15:04.613
Oh, Mrs. Bamford, that's a wrap.
I asked for a sandwich.

15:06.156 --> 15:08.951
[Maria] <i>Ignorance kept me from standing up</i>
<i>for the workers at Checklist</i>

15:09.034 --> 15:10.869

Okay. [chuckling]

15:23.590 --> 15:26.468
-Steady hands, Josue. Very nice.

15:26.552 --> 15:28.512

Oh, "I got a meeting." Whoa!
Mr. Josue Q. Businessman.

15:33.517 --> 15:35.811
I'm really feeling good
about this benefit.

15:35.894 --> 15:38.397
Ever since we've been talking
this past week,

15:38.480 --> 15:41.066
I just feel like...
I can do stand-up for kids.

15:41.150 --> 15:43.735
Yeah... about that.

15:44.319 --> 15:47.531
I watched your stuff on YouTube.
It's just not funny, Maria.

15:48.407 --> 15:49.450
What?

15:49.533 --> 15:50.701
If you do your act,

15:50.784 --> 15:53.162
you will bomb
and get booed out of that benefit.

15:53.245 --> 15:58.083
No. What? Who boos at a benefit?

15:58.167 --> 16:00.461
-Kids?
-Kids.

16:01.795 --> 16:05.007
Oh, God. I already said yes. I can't bomb.

16:05.090 --> 16:06.884
Kids already hate me.

16:06.967 --> 16:08.469
Oh, God.

16:08.552 --> 16:09.845
What do I do?

16:09.928 --> 16:12.306
You could do Gordo Gonzalez's act.

16:13.182 --> 16:14.850
[farting and burping]

16:14.933 --> 16:19.104
No. That's not right.
I can't just steal another comic's act.

Besides, we have very different styles,
comedically.

16:22.649 --> 16:24.985

Why don't I just bill you

-Okay.
-That'll be $10,000

17:54.658 --> 17:57.077

-[softly] $10,000.

17:57.160 --> 17:59.246
Thank you, sweet monkey grape.

Hey, I just wanted to thank you.
Your son has given me so much.

18:12.676 --> 18:14.720
I don't know what your game is
with my son...

18:14.803 --> 18:16.054
but he's just a boy.

18:16.138 --> 18:18.932
I don't want you corrupting him
with your sexual wiles.

18:19.016 --> 18:20.851
No. That's not what is happening.

18:20.934 --> 18:21.977
No, no. I--

18:22.060 --> 18:26.231
I, in no way, am trying to make love
to your son. My God. Uh. Ugh.

18:26.315 --> 18:27.691
No. I...

18:27.774 --> 18:29.735
He's attractive.
Not that he isn't good-looking,

18:29.818 --> 18:31.528
and he has an emotional maturity

18:31.612 --> 18:34.698
beyond his years and...
he has strong, steady hands,

18:34.781 --> 18:36.408
unlike me.
I have a bit of a tremor.

18:36.491 --> 18:40.579
Someday, he'll make a gentle lover,
but not with me.

18:40.662 --> 18:41.997
Just stay away from him!

You know, I can really see myself

I don't wanna hurt your feelings,

I'm doing something new
and need to concentrate.

20:53.754 --> 20:55.422
[in normal voice]
What's your favorite James Bond film?

20:55.505 --> 20:58.258
[imitating Farty]
Well, I love <i>Live and Let...</i>

20:58.341 --> 21:00.510
<i>Diarrhea!</i>

21:00.594 --> 21:01.762
[all laughing]

[Maria] <i>Children were laughing</i>
<i>and smiling at me.</i>

21:13.398 --> 21:15.192
<i>They were not hating me.</i>

21:17.402 --> 21:18.737
<i>But it felt empty.</i>

21:18.820 --> 21:21.031
<i>These were Farty laughs.</i>

21:21.114 --> 21:23.700
You guys, I can't do this.
I-- [inhaling sharply]

21:23.784 --> 21:27.287
I don't steal other comics' material.
That's Gordo Gonzalez's act.

21:27.370 --> 21:28.455
[audience cheering]

21:28.538 --> 21:32.250
Yes, yeah. I know.
He's very good. He's very gifted.

21:32.334 --> 21:35.128
But I am not gonna abandon my principles.

21:35.212 --> 21:36.505
I'm gonna do my own act.

21:36.588 --> 21:38.089
Yes.

21:38.173 --> 21:40.509
Phew. Here goes. Um...

21:42.093 --> 21:43.303
[sighing] I believe in God.

21:43.386 --> 21:46.389
I believe God's a 13-story-tall wizard
who lives in a dark mountain

21:46.473 --> 21:48.517
and never lets me win.

21:48.600 --> 21:50.143
-[booing]
-That, too, can be a comfort.

21:51.186 --> 21:53.146
-That, too...
-[man coughing]

21:53.271 --> 21:55.023
Is anyone thinking of suicide?

21:55.106 --> 21:56.358
Don't do it.

21:56.441 --> 21:58.944
It's not the season for it. Late fall.

21:59.027 --> 22:00.695
[audience jeering]

22:00.779 --> 22:01.863
[booing]

22:02.531 --> 22:04.115
Uh... I see.

22:04.199 --> 22:05.826
Well... [chuckles nervously]

22:07.452 --> 22:11.748
[hyperventilating] Oh... Oh, Josue,
I don't know if I can breathe.

22:11.832 --> 22:13.959
So much child hatred.

22:14.042 --> 22:16.002
-[Josue] It's okay.
-[Maria groans]

22:16.086 --> 22:17.671
You were fine, Maria.

22:19.047 --> 22:20.423
Thanks, guys. See you next week.

22:22.050 --> 22:25.303
Those two agents from WME?
Are you getting into the business?

22:25.387 --> 22:26.888
I've never been out of the business.

22:26.972 --> 22:29.099
[exclaims] You a secret agent?

22:29.182 --> 22:30.892
No, I'm a weed dealer.

22:30.976 --> 22:33.728
Oh! Okay.

22:33.812 --> 22:35.730
-My family had a great time tonight.
-Oh.

22:36.648 --> 22:38.817
Here's 15 grand for your money troubles.

22:38.900 --> 22:42.112
Oh! Crime does pay. [gasping]

22:42.195 --> 22:43.947
If you ever need extra work,

22:44.030 --> 22:46.241
I'm looking for a white woman to go
into schools.

22:46.324 --> 22:48.410
Oh, thank you. That's very thoughtful.

22:48.493 --> 22:50.745
No. I don't think so. But...

22:50.829 --> 22:53.164
[sighing] That was terrible in there.

22:53.248 --> 22:57.460
Those kids hated me.
This is my worst fear.

22:57.544 --> 23:00.672
Kids and bombing... [sighing heavily]

23:00.755 --> 23:03.174
Yeah, the worst
that could happen, happened.

23:03.258 --> 23:04.968
-Yeah.
-You faced your fears

23:05.051 --> 23:06.136
and it didn't kill you.

23:07.387 --> 23:09.639
You know what these kids
are gonna remember?

23:09.723 --> 23:11.099
Free hats.

23:11.725 --> 23:14.060
You're right. [scoffs]

23:14.144 --> 23:16.605
All my life, I've been saddled
by all these fears.

23:16.688 --> 23:19.566
Fear of supporting an evil corporation.

23:19.649 --> 23:22.986
Fear of my best friend, Susan.
Fear of children.

23:23.069 --> 23:25.280
And now... I faced 'em.

23:26.281 --> 23:28.742
Those kids hate me,
but it doesn't matter.

23:29.659 --> 23:30.744
I mean...

23:31.786 --> 23:34.414
-I still got you.
-You had me.

23:35.415 --> 23:36.791
I have some bad news.

23:37.834 --> 23:40.045
My family's not cool about us.

23:40.128 --> 23:44.049
This whole May-December thing
is a no-go zone, bro-zone.

23:44.132 --> 23:45.216
What?

23:45.300 --> 23:47.385
I'm crazy about you, Maria.

23:47.886 --> 23:50.597
-But I just can't see you anymore.
-What, you--

23:50.680 --> 23:53.016
Maybe if I was 40 years older,
this could work.

23:53.099 --> 23:55.477
How old do you think I am?

23:55.560 --> 23:56.811
Seventy-one.

23:56.895 --> 23:58.063
Oh.

23:58.188 --> 24:00.357
Face it... we weren't meant to be.

24:01.441 --> 24:04.027
We had our moment in the sun,
we had our laughs...

24:05.028 --> 24:06.529
It was one hell of a ride.

24:07.447 --> 24:09.658
Maybe one day,
you'll be able to understand.

24:10.742 --> 24:13.161
-Hopefully before you die.
-[sighing]

24:14.287 --> 24:16.122
I'll never forget you, Maria Bamford.

24:25.965 --> 24:28.009
You touched me, Josue!

24:30.261 --> 24:31.805
And I touched you!

24:31.888 --> 24:34.474
[Josue's mom] Save it for the judge.

24:35.517 --> 24:41.106
