00:29.013 --> 00:30.731
Philip, did you get too close?

00:30.893 --> 00:33.566
I don't know, Vivian,
is four feet too close?

00:33.733 --> 00:36.770
Nicky, honey, Daddy won't hurt you.

00:36.933 --> 00:39.811
What is about me that baby
doesn't like? Is it my beard?

00:39.973 --> 00:42.248
Because if it is,
I'll shave it off right now.

00:42.413 --> 00:45.371
Don't you dare.
I love the way that beard feels.

00:45.853 --> 00:48.162
I'm surprised you remember.

00:48.893 --> 00:54.092
Sweetheart, it hasn't been that
long since we've made love, has it?

00:54.533 --> 00:56.728
Five months this Tuesday.

00:58.733 --> 01:00.724
Thin walls.

01:01.533 --> 01:05.128
I'm sorry, honey.
I'll make it better, I promise.

01:05.293 --> 01:08.251
I hope so.
There are priests laughing at me.

01:08.893 --> 01:11.566
I'll have my breakfast
in the family room, Geoffrey.

01:11.733 --> 01:13.849
I'll get the wheelbarrow, sir.

01:17.533 --> 01:19.842
- Morning, Master William.
- Hey.

01:20.013 --> 01:24.131
Aunt Viv, Uncle Phil out there grumbling
something about getting his tubes tied.

01:24.293 --> 01:26.204
He's bluffing.

01:29.573 --> 01:32.770
D.J. Nicky, Nicky, Nicky.
Nick in the house.

01:33.373 --> 01:35.091
Get up. Oh, man.

01:35.253 --> 01:38.370
Aunt Viv, this kid is sprouting.

01:38.533 --> 01:41.684
Hey, you know, another month,
he'll be bigger than Carlton.

01:42.453 --> 01:46.162
I cannot believe that you and Carlton
are moving into your own place.

01:46.333 --> 01:50.929
Seems like just yesterday when I was
wiping the tears from his eyes.

01:51.093 --> 01:52.492
No, no, that was yesterday.

01:52.653 --> 01:55.963
<i>I told you that boy wasn't ready
for Jurassic Park yet.</i>

01:56.773 --> 02:00.163
Will, honey, you and Carlton
will look out for each other, won't you?

02:00.333 --> 02:03.052
Come on, absolutely, Aunt Viv.
We got each other's back.

02:03.213 --> 02:05.568
Great, great, great.
You two just be careful.

02:05.733 --> 02:08.725
There are a lot of sick,
demented perverts out there.

02:08.893 --> 02:10.690
Greetings, all.

02:16.573 --> 02:17.972
Hello, Jazz.

02:18.173 --> 02:20.448
I brought a gift for baby Dicky.

02:20.613 --> 02:22.524
- Nicky.
- Yeah.

02:22.693 --> 02:24.729
- Thank you.
- Whatever.

02:24.893 --> 02:28.806
I know it's five months late,
but I wanted to find just the right thing.

02:28.973 --> 02:31.441
This is very sweet of you, Jazz.
Thank you.

02:38.213 --> 02:41.649
You know, Ms. Banks,
since you had that baby...

02:41.813 --> 02:44.532
...there's something different
about you.

02:50.693 --> 02:54.572
Here, Will.
Thank you, Jazz, very much.

02:54.733 --> 02:59.761
- It's a baby pillow. Isn't it beautiful.
- Oh, yeah.

03:02.373 --> 03:05.809
Jazz, this thing says
"Wendy Beth" on it.

03:06.453 --> 03:08.569
So? When you buy a wallet,
doesn't it have...

03:08.733 --> 03:10.963
...someone else's picture in it first?

03:12.613 --> 03:14.331
Jazz, you stole this pillow.

03:15.093 --> 03:16.731
It's the thought that counts.

04:32.853 --> 04:37.290
- Hi, Daddy. Bye, Daddy.
- Whoa, precious. Where you going?

04:37.453 --> 04:41.366
- To the mall. See you.
- Hold it. Sweetheart, come here.

04:41.773 --> 04:43.968
Today is Saturday, baby.

04:44.133 --> 04:46.966
Why don't you and I
do something together.

04:47.493 --> 04:48.642
Like what?

04:50.173 --> 04:53.483
Like, we could go to the mall.

04:54.573 --> 04:57.610
Daddy, all my friends are at the mall.

04:57.773 --> 05:01.163
Do you know what would happen
if I showed up with my father?

05:02.333 --> 05:05.962
What? Be banned for life
from The Gap?

05:09.813 --> 05:12.373
No, Mom. No, school don't start
for another week.

05:12.533 --> 05:14.922
Oh, yeah, the apartment is great.

05:15.173 --> 05:17.164
Yes, it's in a safe neighborhood, Ma.

05:17.333 --> 05:21.770
Oh, check it out.
The candy store actually sells candy.

05:24.813 --> 05:29.329
Yeah, Mom, I know how proud
you are of me that I'm going to college.

05:31.213 --> 05:34.330
Come on, don't do this, Mom.
You know how this affects me.

05:36.973 --> 05:40.124
Well, yeah, it's like a dream come true
for both of us.

05:42.693 --> 05:44.923
I love you too, Mommy.

05:45.653 --> 05:47.211
Bye-bye.

05:50.733 --> 05:53.645
Kendrick Petroleum up three
and an eighth. What did I tell you?

05:53.813 --> 05:57.089
You called it, son. Vectrocomp Industries
down third day in a row.

05:57.253 --> 05:58.686
- The merger killed them.
- Yeah.

05:58.853 --> 06:01.208
Good thing we got out
when we did, huh?

06:07.013 --> 06:08.571
I'm gonna miss you, son.

06:12.013 --> 06:13.969
Did you say something, Dad?

06:15.493 --> 06:17.449
I don't want you to move out.

06:17.613 --> 06:19.410
Sorry, Dad, I have to go.

06:19.573 --> 06:21.609
- No, you don't.
- Will says I do.

06:21.813 --> 06:24.805
He says it's time for me to leave
the nest, become independent...

06:24.973 --> 06:26.804
...and have sex with girls.

06:27.773 --> 06:30.003
Safe sex, mind you, but lots of it.

06:31.933 --> 06:34.731
Excuse me. Is this what
you've been telling my boy?

06:34.893 --> 06:36.406
- What?
- That life is one big orgy.

06:36.573 --> 06:38.484
- I never said...
- College is hard work, son.

06:38.653 --> 06:40.962
Followed by a family,
which is even more hard work.

06:41.133 --> 06:44.250
And a teenage daughter who doesn't
wanna be seen with you in public.

06:44.413 --> 06:46.529
And a wife who won't let you
anywhere near her.

06:46.693 --> 06:48.923
And a butler who may be
the father of your child.

06:49.093 --> 06:51.482
- And a gardener, a gardener...
- Dad! Dad!

07:03.133 --> 07:04.725
Hey, Will.

07:04.893 --> 07:06.963
Will, I can't bear to see him like this.

07:07.133 --> 07:09.852
That's why we moving,
so we don't have to.

07:10.813 --> 07:12.724
Well, look at him. He needs me.

07:12.893 --> 07:15.646
No, I don't.
I don't need either one of you.

07:15.853 --> 07:19.846
There is a silver lining
in my dark cloud. Hilary.

07:21.533 --> 07:23.649
I'm sorry, Hilary Banks?

07:24.813 --> 07:27.122
You know, fate works
in mysterious ways.

07:27.333 --> 07:30.723
For years, I've been trying to get her
to move out of the house and now...

07:30.893 --> 07:33.361
...when I'm gonna be alone,
she is my salvation.

07:33.533 --> 07:36.491
So you two, you two go on
with your little lives.

07:36.653 --> 07:39.725
My Hilary needs me.

07:42.893 --> 07:46.488
Okay, everybody, guess what.

07:50.493 --> 07:53.963
Okay, I can see you're stumped.

07:54.893 --> 07:57.043
I'm getting married.

07:57.213 --> 07:58.487
To Trevor.

08:00.093 --> 08:02.209
Oh, Hilary. What is this?

08:02.373 --> 08:04.045
Hilary's marrying Trevor.

08:04.213 --> 08:06.329
Oh, come on. Don't tease me.

08:07.053 --> 08:10.932
- Mother, it's true.
- When did he propose?

08:11.093 --> 08:13.607
This morning, as he was leaving
the pool house.

08:14.893 --> 08:16.804
I mean, this morning on the phone.

08:20.453 --> 08:22.967
You certainly ain't wasting
no time getting a gown.

08:23.133 --> 08:25.931
Mom and Dad bought this for me
when I hit puberty.

08:26.093 --> 08:29.051
One down, three to go.

08:30.013 --> 08:33.369
Oh, Philip, you all right?
You look like you're in shock.

08:33.533 --> 08:36.808
Shock? Oh, no, it figures.

08:37.332 --> 08:40.405
Here's the best part. I asked Trevor
to officially propose to me...

08:40.573 --> 08:43.292
<i>...during his Slice of L.A. segment
on tomorrow's news.</i>

08:43.453 --> 08:47.446
That way, all of Los Angeles
can share in our happiness.

08:55.333 --> 08:56.846
Hilary, sweetheart...

08:57.013 --> 09:00.085
...I think there may be a question
that you should ask yourself.

09:00.573 --> 09:01.767
I already did.

09:01.933 --> 09:04.447
I'm going to register at Tiffany's.

09:06.773 --> 09:09.446
No, no, sweetheart.

09:09.933 --> 09:11.252
Are you in love with Trevor?

09:11.653 --> 09:14.963
What's love got to do with it?
I'm having a wedding.

09:17.413 --> 09:20.132
Hey, back off, lke.
We're having a wedding.

09:20.573 --> 09:22.609
- Let's go do the invitation list.
- Oh, Mommy.

09:22.773 --> 09:25.571
Way to go, sis. The guy's a prince.

09:27.133 --> 09:29.124
I can't believe
she's gonna marry that jerk.

09:29.293 --> 09:30.612
Trevor's not a jerk.

09:30.773 --> 09:34.243
He's a superficial, self-centered,
TelePrompTer-reading airhead.

09:34.693 --> 09:36.968
Sounds like a match to me.

09:37.133 --> 09:39.089
My little girl is leaving me.

09:39.653 --> 09:41.291
Are you gonna be all right, big guy?

09:41.453 --> 09:44.411
Because I can stay here and help you
through this rocky time.

09:45.053 --> 09:46.850
I'll be fine.

09:47.333 --> 09:49.085
We out then.

09:49.773 --> 09:52.128
- Bye, Dad.
- You take care, man.

10:01.573 --> 10:05.122
So if you take package D,
you get basic cable...

10:05.293 --> 10:09.332
...three premiums
and the Lust Channel.

10:15.053 --> 10:17.521
Carlton, how you feel
about the Lust Channel?

10:17.693 --> 10:21.572
I think it's 24 hours
of shallow, pointless nudity.

10:21.973 --> 10:24.089
You heard the bird. We'll take it.

10:28.413 --> 10:29.926
You'll be hooked up tomorrow.

10:30.093 --> 10:32.129
Thank you, Mr. Smith.

10:34.453 --> 10:36.205
You heard that right. Mr. Smith.

10:36.373 --> 10:39.206
This boy's getting
some respect around here.

10:39.373 --> 10:41.603
Will, I've met the woman
of my dreams.

10:41.773 --> 10:44.765
Word? I didn't know
RuPaul lived in L.A.

10:46.733 --> 10:48.769
See, one of my duties as mascot...

10:48.933 --> 10:51.128
...is to walk around
and greet people on campus.

10:51.293 --> 10:55.445
So I'm doing my thing, and this wise guy
starts messing with my plumage.

10:55.613 --> 10:58.207
Then she came to my rescue.

10:58.373 --> 11:02.207
Five feet, 11 inches
of feminine firepower.

11:04.653 --> 11:08.123
I bet she could toss me
around this room.

11:09.413 --> 11:11.290
Hope it works out for you, buddy.

11:11.853 --> 11:15.641
- Oh, Will, she's crazy about me.
- What makes you think that?

11:15.813 --> 11:19.169
Get this, she said she's looking forward
to seeing me again.

11:19.773 --> 11:21.729
- So?
- So no one's ever said that to me...

11:21.893 --> 11:23.372
...except my dentist.

11:23.533 --> 11:25.808
You were right.
We're on our own three hours...

11:25.973 --> 11:28.407
...and my life's already taken
a turn for the better.

11:28.813 --> 11:31.202
Well, let freedom ring.

11:33.253 --> 11:35.084
Oh, that's the door.

11:37.493 --> 11:39.927
Hey, Mr. Gorodetsky.

11:40.093 --> 11:42.482
I thought I said no pets.

11:43.253 --> 11:45.813
I'm not really a peacock.

11:46.213 --> 11:48.807
And I'm not really a slumlord.

11:49.373 --> 11:52.649
Look, if you need to reach me,
I'll be at my home number.

11:53.093 --> 11:56.688
- You don't live here?
- Are you kidding?

11:59.853 --> 12:02.083
Oh, yeah.

12:02.573 --> 12:05.883
I hope that's not
a long-distance call you're making.

12:06.093 --> 12:08.209
Can I see that first dollar
you ever had again?

12:08.373 --> 12:11.126
- Oh, sure.
- Put it away, you cheapskate.

12:11.293 --> 12:14.888
I'm just calling Jazz, invite a couple
of people over. Christen the new crib.

12:15.053 --> 12:17.362
Is there anyone in particular
you'd like to invite?

12:18.213 --> 12:19.532
I don't keep friends.

12:19.693 --> 12:23.572
In time of war, they can be tortured
and give up valuable secrets about you.

12:31.853 --> 12:34.765
I was talking
about your Miss Lady Peacock.

12:34.933 --> 12:38.562
Are you nuts? I'm not bringing her
within a hundred yards of you.

12:38.733 --> 12:40.405
What? Carlton, I'm your cousin, man.

12:40.573 --> 12:42.848
The cousin who stole
every woman I ever had.

12:43.013 --> 12:44.605
Oh, please, I stole one girl.

12:44.773 --> 12:47.162
My point exactly.

12:49.893 --> 12:53.124
All right, Carlton, I promise you
I ain't gonna press up on her.

12:53.293 --> 12:55.853
As far as I'm concerned,
she's just a man with breasts.

12:56.013 --> 12:58.083
She does have breasts, doesn't she?

12:59.853 --> 13:01.525
Well, all right.

13:01.693 --> 13:03.888
She runs the campus store.
I'll go ask her.

13:04.053 --> 13:05.532
- Carlton.
- What?

13:05.693 --> 13:07.809
Change your clothes.

13:08.853 --> 13:12.129
Geoffrey. Geoffrey, look.
It's Carlton's first haircut.

13:13.573 --> 13:16.087
Hilary's first day at kindergarten.

13:16.253 --> 13:21.168
Geoffrey. Geoffrey.
Here's Ashley on a diving board.

13:22.453 --> 13:24.091
The way we were.

13:24.253 --> 13:28.690
You've got to look to the future, sir.
Put the past behind you.

13:28.853 --> 13:31.492
I guess. You're right.

13:32.253 --> 13:34.847
- What's for dinner?
- Leftovers.

13:37.333 --> 13:38.652
Hold it, hold it.

13:39.613 --> 13:41.922
- Who do we have here?
- We met at the mall.

13:42.093 --> 13:44.049
What's your name, son?

13:44.453 --> 13:46.011
This.

13:48.733 --> 13:51.566
This is a stick with a snake
wrapped around it.

13:51.893 --> 13:54.771
- It's a symbol, like Prince.
- Prince who?

13:55.893 --> 13:59.249
See, that's exactly why fathers
ain't allowed at the mall.

14:07.973 --> 14:09.008
What's this thing?

14:09.173 --> 14:12.643
It's a symbol for
"get out of my house!"

14:14.773 --> 14:17.048
Daddy, I love him!

14:21.333 --> 14:23.164
Keep it up, sir...

14:23.333 --> 14:26.086
...and I'll be all you have left.

14:31.973 --> 14:34.168
You owe me.
That's Boardwalk with a hotel.

14:34.333 --> 14:36.927
That's 2 grand. Thank you.

14:38.773 --> 14:43.403
- Community Chest.
- Yes, and what a lovely community it is.

14:43.933 --> 14:45.810
Coming through, coming through.

14:45.973 --> 14:48.328
Hey, Carl, where you been, man?

14:48.533 --> 14:53.323
I was watching the sun set
over the Bank of America building.

14:54.293 --> 14:56.523
I think you know everybody...
Oh, except LaTanya.

14:57.213 --> 14:58.726
Hello.

14:59.653 --> 15:01.405
I'd like to set the record straight...

15:01.573 --> 15:04.724
...before any other woman
comes on to me.

15:05.933 --> 15:08.242
I'm in a monogamous relationship.

15:08.413 --> 15:11.769
- Really? How long?
- It's going on five hours.

15:12.413 --> 15:15.485
I'd appreciate it if you scavengers
would refrain from eating this.

15:15.653 --> 15:17.132
I'm saving it for my Jacqueline.

15:17.773 --> 15:20.571
Jacqueline is his imaginary friend.

15:22.333 --> 15:23.846
Hey.

15:26.213 --> 15:27.965
Hey, my brother, can I help you?

15:28.133 --> 15:30.363
Yeah, man, this is where the party at?

15:34.573 --> 15:35.801
What party, man?

15:35.973 --> 15:39.648
The party we paid $25
apiece to go to.

15:39.813 --> 15:41.849
Say, where's En Vogue?

15:42.013 --> 15:44.481
Hey, my brother, I think
you got the wrong crib, man.

15:44.693 --> 15:46.285
This is apartment 206, right?

15:46.453 --> 15:48.569
Well, yeah, man, but it ain't no party.

15:48.733 --> 15:50.769
Read it and weep, man.

15:53.333 --> 15:56.803
"It's the rump-baking,
booty-shaking...

15:56.973 --> 16:00.488
...don't miss the mix
in apartment 206."

16:00.893 --> 16:03.327
- This is Jazz's handwriting.
- How do you know?

16:03.493 --> 16:06.087
All the letters is cut out of magazines.

16:06.453 --> 16:08.762
- Hey.
- Hey, what's up with you, man?

16:08.933 --> 16:12.642
Hey, my brother. This is a private party,
and y'all are going to have to step.

16:12.813 --> 16:14.246
Not without my $25.

16:14.933 --> 16:16.924
Get out or I'll call security.

16:18.133 --> 16:20.806
Not old dude with the flashlight.

16:20.973 --> 16:23.646
He carries a whistle too.

16:24.253 --> 16:27.290
All right, man, we don't want
that kind of trouble.

16:27.453 --> 16:29.728
Guess we'll just go home
and watch some TV.

16:29.933 --> 16:32.242
Sounds like a good idea, my brother.

16:34.133 --> 16:36.363
Hey. Hey.

16:36.533 --> 16:39.730
Why don't you just take the pictures
off the wall while you're at it.

16:39.933 --> 16:43.050
Good idea. Go nice with my new TV.

16:45.333 --> 16:48.052
Look, Carlton, if anybody else comes,
you take care of it.

16:48.213 --> 16:49.771
I'm going to get our stuff back.

16:49.933 --> 16:53.130
Hey, y'all come back here
with our stuff, man.

16:53.893 --> 16:55.611
This should cover your $25.

16:55.773 --> 16:58.446
Oh, the blender's still on warranty.

16:58.893 --> 17:01.691
It looks like your
Jacqueline stood you up.

17:01.893 --> 17:05.806
It also looked like Loni and Burt
had a good marriage.

17:06.532 --> 17:08.842
Dance with me, you freak.

17:09.413 --> 17:12.165
Maybe if you asked me nicely.

17:12.933 --> 17:14.924
This party's played out.

17:15.093 --> 17:17.128
Oh, tell Will the crib is dope.

17:17.532 --> 17:19.967
Like that's all I got on my mind.

17:22.333 --> 17:24.368
Come on, Jacqueline.

17:24.532 --> 17:26.967
My bedtime's coming soon.

18:09.973 --> 18:11.122
Bird man?

18:11.693 --> 18:13.365
Jacqueline.

18:15.733 --> 18:18.406
Wait, I thought there were
gonna be other people here.

18:18.573 --> 18:21.041
Well, there were. They left.

18:21.453 --> 18:24.013
Some with lovely parting gifts.

18:25.013 --> 18:26.731
Maybe I better leave too.

18:26.893 --> 18:29.043
No, don't.

18:29.653 --> 18:33.009
I went and got us some dinner
from Chez Paul.

18:33.173 --> 18:34.401
Filet mignon?

18:34.813 --> 18:37.281
Thanks, but I don't eat red meat.

18:38.333 --> 18:40.289
I'll give it up too.

18:40.453 --> 18:41.966
No need, bird man.

18:43.773 --> 18:47.812
Jacqueline, how about a dance
before you go...

18:47.973 --> 18:50.771
...to christen the new crib.

18:51.573 --> 18:54.565
It'd be my first dance
with a brother from Bel-Air.

18:54.733 --> 18:57.611
Better take the opportunity.
There aren't too many of us.

18:59.853 --> 19:01.445
All right.

19:18.293 --> 19:19.521
What is this anyway?

19:20.253 --> 19:23.245
Bobby Vinton, the Polish Prince.

19:23.613 --> 19:25.524
Well, I have some Manilow
if you prefer.

19:25.693 --> 19:29.481
No, the Polish Prince will do just fine.

19:48.213 --> 19:49.441
<i>It's my Jacqueline.</i>

19:50.173 --> 19:51.765
<i>It's the TV.</i>

20:14.333 --> 20:15.482
Jackie?

20:17.293 --> 20:19.682
Oh, my God. Will.

20:23.333 --> 20:26.325
No, no, no!

20:38.893 --> 20:42.249
Go, peacock. Go, peacock.
Go, peacock.
