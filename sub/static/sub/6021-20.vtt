WEBVTT

00:05.538 --> 00:08.302
-Man, I'm starving.
-How can you be hungry...

00:08.475 --> 00:10.500
...after what you ate
at that Mets game?

00:10.677 --> 00:13.168
Because ballpark food
doesn't count as real food.

00:13.346 --> 00:14.643
Right. It's just an activity.

00:14.814 --> 00:16.941
Like that paddle
with the ball and rubber band.

00:17.117 --> 00:20.348
You know, my friend Bob Saccamano
made a fortune off of those.

00:20.520 --> 00:23.455
See, he came up with the idea
for the rubber band.

00:23.623 --> 00:26.683
Before that, people would just
hit the ball and it would fly away.

00:28.428 --> 00:31.363
I can't believe you made me leave
before the end of the game.

00:31.531 --> 00:34.056
Oh, come on, Jerry,
it was nine to nothing.

00:34.234 --> 00:36.327
We were getting shellacked.

00:36.503 --> 00:38.095
Those nachos are killing me.

00:39.072 --> 00:40.471
I thought you were hungry.

00:41.074 --> 00:43.235
It's complicated.

00:43.410 --> 00:46.470
-Jerry, you're gonna miss the exit.
-Keep your shirt on, I got it.

00:46.646 --> 00:48.944
Watch out for that maroon Golf.

00:49.549 --> 00:51.540
Look at this guy.
He's trying to box me out.

00:53.386 --> 00:55.752
I'll tell you when you can go.
Wait, wait, wait.

00:55.922 --> 00:57.685
Now, now, now.
No, no, no.

00:57.857 --> 01:00.655
Now. Go, go. No, no. Wait.

01:00.827 --> 01:04.058
Wait. Now, now, now. Jerry, go--

01:07.500 --> 01:09.661
Oh, calm down, maroon Golf.

01:09.836 --> 01:11.895
He thinks I cut him off.
He accelerated.

01:14.074 --> 01:15.939
You want me to moon him?
Let's moon him.

01:16.109 --> 01:18.669
Roll up your window.
Let's do a pressed ham under glass.

01:18.845 --> 01:20.176
Oh, no, I couldn't do that.

01:20.346 --> 01:22.473
Look at this, look.
He's giving us the finger.

01:22.649 --> 01:24.844
-Oh, all right.
-Okay.

01:29.055 --> 01:31.580
So I saw that new movie
about the <i>Hindenberg.</i>

01:31.758 --> 01:33.157
Oh, yeah, what's that called?

01:33.326 --> 01:35.294
<i>Blimp: The Hindenberg Story.</i>

01:35.462 --> 01:38.226
-How was it?
-I found it morose.

01:38.398 --> 01:40.593
Why dwell on
these negative themes?

01:40.767 --> 01:44.203
They should make a movie about all
the <i>Hindenberg</i> flights that made it.

01:44.971 --> 01:47.667
Anyway, right in the middle,
the ship blows up.

01:47.841 --> 01:49.809
Burning debris, bodies falling...

01:49.976 --> 01:54.140
...and then just as this eerie silence
settles over the airfield...

01:54.314 --> 01:57.112
...I yelled out, "That's gotta hurt."

01:57.750 --> 01:59.377
The place went nuts.

01:59.552 --> 02:01.383
Imagine the laugh
you could have gotten...

02:01.554 --> 02:03.920
...if you had yelled that out
at the actual disaster.

02:04.324 --> 02:05.757
Yeah.

02:06.359 --> 02:07.724
Why are we slowing down?

02:07.894 --> 02:09.919
What is that music?

02:10.430 --> 02:12.557
What's with all these flags?

02:13.366 --> 02:14.856
Oh, no.

02:15.034 --> 02:18.231
-It's the Puerto Rican Day parade.
-It's the Puerto Rican Day parade.

02:18.404 --> 02:21.931
The city shuts down Fifth Avenue.
They never let anyone through.

02:22.108 --> 02:24.542
We are never getting home.

02:24.777 --> 02:26.176
I'll check it out.

02:28.000 --> 02:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:35.455 --> 02:36.547
Yep.

02:36.723 --> 02:38.918
Yep, the streets are all blocked.

02:39.092 --> 02:41.526
I think every Puerto Rican in the world
is out here.

02:41.694 --> 02:44.356
Well, it is our day.

02:46.733 --> 02:48.894
Wrong car. Sorry.

02:49.068 --> 02:51.059
<i>And the Mets score two
in the eighth inning.</i>

02:51.237 --> 02:53.671
See? If we had stayed,
we could have seen those runs.

02:53.840 --> 02:55.967
I could've had some ice cream.

02:56.142 --> 02:58.736
That might have calmed down
the nachos.

02:58.912 --> 03:01.881
I'm gonna miss <i>60 Minutes</i>.
You know I hate to miss <i>60 Minutes.</i>

03:02.048 --> 03:04.676
It's part of my Sunday
weekend wind-down.

03:04.851 --> 03:06.819
How you can unwind
with that clock ticking?

03:06.986 --> 03:08.078
It makes me anxious.

03:09.022 --> 03:12.856
All right, gentlemen. I scouted it out.
I think we can get out over there.

03:13.026 --> 03:15.688
But that's a one-way street
coming this way.

03:15.862 --> 03:17.625
Besides, how am I gonna get
over there?

03:17.797 --> 03:19.731
Just inch over.
You worm your way.

03:19.899 --> 03:22.197
Just do it, Jerry.

03:22.368 --> 03:24.962
This exhaust. I'm gonna throw up.

03:25.138 --> 03:27.629
You know,
you should make yourself throw up.

03:27.807 --> 03:29.934
You know you're going to.

03:30.109 --> 03:32.043
All right, I'm worming.

03:32.212 --> 03:35.045
Hey, Jerry. You know who
the grand marshal is of this thing?

03:35.215 --> 03:37.877
None other than Miss Chita Rivera.

03:38.918 --> 03:40.112
They're not letting me in.

03:40.286 --> 03:43.414
-My hand is out.
-We're gonna need more than a hand.

03:43.590 --> 03:45.251
They have to see a human face.

03:45.425 --> 03:47.086
You sure you want his face?

03:48.661 --> 03:52.153
No, no, no.
It was Maria Conchita Alonso.

03:52.332 --> 03:55.426
-This guy's giving me the stare-ahead.
-The stare-ahead, I hate that.

03:55.602 --> 03:57.365
I use it all the time.

03:57.537 --> 04:01.234
Look at me. I am man.

04:01.407 --> 04:03.068
I am you.

04:04.344 --> 04:05.777
<i>Hi. Can we get in?</i>

04:07.614 --> 04:10.378
All right, he's letting you in.
Thank you.

04:11.551 --> 04:14.816
Oh, I know who it is. Stacy Keach.

04:16.022 --> 04:19.014
-One more lane to go.
-All right. We're here.

04:22.028 --> 04:23.962
Oh, look who's here.

04:24.130 --> 04:27.190
My old buddy. Black Saab.

04:27.367 --> 04:29.301
Maroon Golf.

04:29.469 --> 04:31.130
Where you going, black Saab?

04:31.304 --> 04:33.363
You seem to be a tad askew.

04:33.539 --> 04:35.507
Could you move your car
back a little?

04:35.675 --> 04:37.370
Oh, sorry.

04:37.543 --> 04:39.374
I seem to have cut you off.

04:39.545 --> 04:41.604
All right.
I know where this is going...

04:41.781 --> 04:44.147
...and I am going somewhere else.

04:44.317 --> 04:47.150
You can't do that.
You can't just leave the group.

04:47.320 --> 04:50.118
I've been trying to leave this group
for 10 years.

04:53.826 --> 04:55.555
Well, that's rude.

04:55.728 --> 04:57.559
-Can you believe her?
-Yeah.

04:57.730 --> 04:59.664
-I'll see you later.
-Where are you going?

04:59.832 --> 05:02.528
The movies.
<i>Blimp</i> is playing right there.

05:02.702 --> 05:05.068
You're going to that again?
To do that stupid line?

05:05.238 --> 05:07.798
It's a performance, Jerry.
Like what you do.

05:07.974 --> 05:09.805
That's not what I do.

05:09.976 --> 05:12.809
-Isn't it?
-Maybe a little.

05:13.913 --> 05:15.471
Hell, I guess it is.

05:18.918 --> 05:22.649
You know, actually, Jerry, you haven't
worked a room that big in a while.

05:25.558 --> 05:27.526
Look at that guy's dog.

05:28.227 --> 05:32.789
I hate it when their ears
get flipped inside out like that.

05:33.499 --> 05:35.660
Why doesn't he fix it?

05:37.970 --> 05:42.930
Hey! Fold your dog's ear back!

05:49.182 --> 05:51.412
This isn't moving.

05:51.851 --> 05:55.548
-I could walk faster than this.
-No, you can't.

05:55.722 --> 05:58.885
Yes, I can. Here.

05:59.058 --> 06:00.855
I'm out of here.

06:07.433 --> 06:09.162
Now it's moving. Oh, yeah, I knew it.

06:09.335 --> 06:12.133
Hey! Hey!

06:14.407 --> 06:15.396
Where to?

06:15.575 --> 06:17.873
That's cute. That's really cute.

06:22.181 --> 06:25.116
Come on.

06:26.419 --> 06:27.784
All right.

06:28.921 --> 06:30.752
Bye again.

06:44.637 --> 06:48.403
Hey. Taxi! Taxi!

06:51.377 --> 06:52.776
Ladies.

06:54.313 --> 06:57.476
I-- I haven't seen this before.

06:57.650 --> 06:59.447
Oh, what is that dot?

07:00.553 --> 07:03.647
I think someone has one of those
funny laser pointers.

07:12.432 --> 07:15.595
Give me a box of those
and one of those.

07:16.602 --> 07:20.538
Excuse me. Are you the guy
with that funny laser?

07:20.706 --> 07:22.606
The laser's not funny. I'm funny.

07:22.775 --> 07:24.299
Yeah. The thing is...

07:24.477 --> 07:29.813
...I had this little zinger of my own
I wanted to try.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.442
It's right in the explosion scene...

07:33.619 --> 07:37.180
...so if you could just leave me
a little window....

07:40.493 --> 07:44.862
You know, my aunt had a thing
removed with a laser.

07:45.631 --> 07:48.691
All right, I don't wanna
interrupt your meal, so....

07:50.069 --> 07:52.094
<i>What a comeback
for the New York Mets.</i>

07:52.271 --> 07:55.934
-<i>Six runs in the bottom of the ninth--</i>
-I've gotta see this game.

07:56.108 --> 07:58.508
If it wasn't for this guy,
we could get out of here.

07:58.678 --> 08:01.169
This traffic's a killer, ain't it?

08:01.347 --> 08:03.577
You wanna get out of here?
Here's what we do.

08:03.749 --> 08:06.616
We leave the car here.
We take the plates off...

08:06.786 --> 08:10.722
...we scratch the serial number off
the engine block and we walk away.

08:10.890 --> 08:13.120
-Walk away?
-Well, you've got insurance.

08:13.292 --> 08:17.023
You tell them that the car was stolen,
and then you get another one free.

08:17.196 --> 08:20.597
-Isn't there a deductible?
-All right, what is your deductible?

08:20.766 --> 08:22.529
-I don't know.
-Yes.

08:22.702 --> 08:25.034
Because they've already
deducted it.

08:25.204 --> 08:27.104
-From what?
-The car.

08:27.273 --> 08:30.709
Which we're leaving,
so the net is zero.

08:30.877 --> 08:35.576
See, you pocket the money,
if there is any, and you get a new car.

08:36.916 --> 08:39.611
We're not leaving the car.

08:39.784 --> 08:43.687
All right. If you refuse to grow up
and scam your insurance company...

08:43.856 --> 08:46.256
...you'll have to work this out
with maroon Golf.

08:48.294 --> 08:50.023
Absolutely not. He sped up.

08:50.196 --> 08:52.562
<i>Swing long, lined hard toward
left-center field...</i>

08:52.732 --> 08:54.666
<i>...that's in the gap,
that's a base hit--</i>

08:54.834 --> 08:56.358
I'm ready to talk.

08:57.203 --> 09:00.730
Hey, there's that laser guy again.
He's funny.

09:01.374 --> 09:04.138
-I never meet anyone funny.
-I know.

09:04.310 --> 09:06.642
A sense of humor
is so much more important to me...

09:06.812 --> 09:09.337
...than looks or hair.

09:15.788 --> 09:18.120
That's gotta hurt!

09:19.392 --> 09:21.724
It's gotta hurt!

09:22.728 --> 09:24.218
Hurt!

09:25.131 --> 09:26.598
Because....

09:27.833 --> 09:29.323
Damn you, laser guy!

09:29.502 --> 09:32.630
You had to grab it all
with your lowbrow laser shtick.

09:32.805 --> 09:36.468
You're just a prop comic.
Where's the craft?

09:37.777 --> 09:40.803
Look, it's on the bald guy.

09:40.980 --> 09:43.471
I am so glad
we came to this showing.

09:48.988 --> 09:50.012
Okay, here's the deal.

09:50.189 --> 09:52.453
He wants you to acknowledge
that you cut him off...

09:52.625 --> 09:54.286
...with an "I'm sorry" wave.

09:54.460 --> 09:56.690
-What's that?
-You raise the hand, lower the head.

09:56.862 --> 09:59.057
"I'm sorry. The buttons are really big
on the car.

09:59.231 --> 10:01.461
I don't understand.
I haven't read the manual."

10:01.634 --> 10:02.623
You get my drift.

10:03.402 --> 10:05.029
Okay.

10:10.476 --> 10:14.139
"Hallelujah. Praise the Lord."
But I'll take it.

10:14.313 --> 10:19.148
Yes. All right, Lamar, back it up
a little bit so we can get out now.

10:19.318 --> 10:22.617
All right. At last,
we're finally getting out of here.

10:22.788 --> 10:24.483
What's that on your forehead?

10:24.657 --> 10:25.646
Probably chocolate.

10:25.825 --> 10:27.986
Is that one of those laser pointers?

10:28.160 --> 10:32.460
Hey, Jerry, crank up the Floyd,
it's a George Laserium.

10:32.632 --> 10:33.963
All right, stop it.

10:34.133 --> 10:36.158
Stay away from my breasts-- Chest!

10:37.970 --> 10:39.904
See you around, maroon Golf.

10:40.506 --> 10:43.703
And by the way,
that was an "I'm not sorry" wave.

10:43.876 --> 10:46.003
-What was that?
-I'm glad I cut you off...

10:46.178 --> 10:48.203
...because black Saab rules.

10:48.381 --> 10:50.508
So long, jackass.

10:53.819 --> 10:55.047
Elaine?

10:55.221 --> 10:56.848
Jerry?

10:58.491 --> 11:01.824
Jackass. So I'm a jackass now?

11:12.938 --> 11:17.238
So if everyone would just put their
cars in reverse at the same time...

11:17.410 --> 11:18.604
...we can do this.

11:18.778 --> 11:22.771
All right, on the count of three.
Can everyone hear me?

11:22.948 --> 11:25.075
Hey, Amigo,
are you paying attention?

11:25.251 --> 11:26.411
<i>Buenos días,</i> my friend.

11:26.585 --> 11:28.143
Not you.

11:28.320 --> 11:31.255
The guy in the Amigo.

11:32.391 --> 11:36.020
Well, here.
Here is good.

11:36.829 --> 11:39.457
Oh, yeah, sure.
Now I'm gonna be stuck here.

11:39.632 --> 11:43.659
But you knew the way to go.
You went to college.

11:43.836 --> 11:47.670
Hey, I went to Tufts.
It was my safety school.

11:47.840 --> 11:51.207
So don't talk to me about hardship.

11:55.247 --> 11:58.705
Boy. Can you believe this mess?

11:58.884 --> 12:01.444
Elaine, why did you have the cab
come down this street?

12:01.620 --> 12:02.951
We were almost out.

12:03.122 --> 12:05.352
So that was your girlfriend
that blocked you in.

12:05.524 --> 12:06.548
That's real good.

12:06.726 --> 12:07.784
I'm not his girlfriend.

12:07.960 --> 12:10.224
Well, actually, we used to date,
but not anymore--

12:10.396 --> 12:12.330
-Elaine, he doesn't need--
-Used to date.

12:12.498 --> 12:14.966
So I guess you found out
he's a jackass.

12:15.134 --> 12:17.159
Because that's what's
gonna happen.

12:18.471 --> 12:21.497
Oh, he's giving you a mustache.
Where is this guy?

12:21.674 --> 12:24.006
No, don't. Don't look around.
That's what he wants.

12:24.176 --> 12:25.803
All right, well, I'll see you.

12:27.146 --> 12:30.274
Hey, George, I think there's a sniper
looking to pop you.

12:30.983 --> 12:34.783
This thing can't hurt me, can it?
I mean, it is a laser.

12:34.954 --> 12:37.354
-What if it hits my eye?
-I don't know.

12:37.523 --> 12:39.991
I can't be blind, Jerry.
The blind are courageous.

12:40.159 --> 12:43.026
You'll be fine, as long as
it doesn't hit you in the pupil...

12:43.195 --> 12:46.824
...because then the whole ball
will go up like the Death Star.

12:48.033 --> 12:50.263
All right, I gotta go find a bathroom.

12:50.936 --> 12:54.997
Hold it, George. Don't move.
It's right between your eyes.

12:56.041 --> 12:57.372
Oh, my God.

12:58.511 --> 13:00.570
Hey, there's the soda guy.

13:01.580 --> 13:03.605
Hey, jackass,
get me a Diet Dr Pepper.

13:03.783 --> 13:05.410
All right.

13:14.193 --> 13:15.353
-Hey.
-Hey, hey.

13:17.129 --> 13:19.893
Oh, this is nuts.
I can't get across anywhere.

13:20.065 --> 13:22.226
Well, none of us can. We're trapped.

13:23.035 --> 13:24.696
Hey.

13:25.004 --> 13:27.996
Hey, everyone, this way.
I think we can get out through here.

13:28.174 --> 13:30.438
Oh, I don't know
if that's such a good idea.

13:30.609 --> 13:34.136
Look. No one knows
how long this parade is gonna last.

13:34.313 --> 13:36.747
They are a very festive people.

13:36.916 --> 13:41.444
All I know is that it's Sunday night,
and I have got to unwind.

13:41.620 --> 13:42.985
Now, who's with me?

13:44.123 --> 13:45.181
Father?

13:45.357 --> 13:49.384
None of us saw the nylon flap.
That might mean something.

13:49.562 --> 13:54.022
-All right.
-All right. Come on, come on. Let's go.

13:54.200 --> 13:56.065
-Let's go.
-But it's dark.

13:56.235 --> 13:58.294
Get in there.

14:12.084 --> 14:14.450
Yes, I'm interested in the apartment.

14:14.620 --> 14:16.850
-Yes, come in, come in.
-Okay.

14:20.025 --> 14:21.686
I'm Christine Nyhart.

14:21.861 --> 14:24.921
-Delicious to meet you.
-Did the broker send you over?

14:25.097 --> 14:26.530
Yes, most likely.

14:26.699 --> 14:28.326
Yes, I'm H. E. Pennypacker.

14:28.500 --> 14:32.800
I'm a wealthy industrialist
and philanthropist and a bicyclist.

14:32.972 --> 14:34.803
And, yes, I'm looking for a place...

14:34.974 --> 14:38.740
...where I can settle down
with my peculiar habits...

14:38.911 --> 14:42.278
...and the women
that I frequent with.

14:44.016 --> 14:45.415
Mombasa, huh?

14:45.584 --> 14:48.109
The asking price is
a million and a half dollars.

14:48.287 --> 14:50.687
I spend that much on aftershave.

14:50.856 --> 14:55.486
Yes, I buy and sell men like myself
every day.

14:55.661 --> 14:58.323
Now, I assume that there's
a waterfall grotto?

14:58.497 --> 14:59.930
No.

15:00.099 --> 15:02.226
-How about a bathroom?
-It has four.

15:02.401 --> 15:05.768
Yes. And where would
the absolute nearest one be?

15:05.938 --> 15:07.599
Just down the hall.

15:19.151 --> 15:21.949
Oh, don't worry, we'll get you home
to your husband real soon.

15:22.121 --> 15:23.110
I'm not married.

15:23.689 --> 15:26.954
Well, l, for one, really respect that.

15:27.626 --> 15:29.116
Thank you.

15:30.095 --> 15:32.655
Hey. Guess who's not married.

15:34.166 --> 15:37.363
Is the boyfriend still in the picture?

15:39.838 --> 15:42.864
-Come on, Father, you can make it.
-No, I can't. I've got a bad hip.

15:43.042 --> 15:45.340
-Go on without me.
-No, I won't.

15:45.511 --> 15:47.172
Leave me. You must.

15:48.080 --> 15:49.980
All right. Take it easy.

15:50.649 --> 15:54.050
All right, we can move faster
without Father O'Gimpy.

15:54.219 --> 15:56.119
I heard that.

15:57.022 --> 16:01.152
You know, I don't think I've ever seen
a man driving a Saab convertible.

16:01.427 --> 16:02.826
Still haven't.

16:05.698 --> 16:07.757
What seems to be the problem,
officer?

16:07.933 --> 16:10.800
They're for protection, Jerry.
Can you tell where I'm looking?

16:10.970 --> 16:12.995
-At me?
-No.

16:13.639 --> 16:15.038
Well, it's back.

16:15.207 --> 16:17.198
Bring it on, baby.

16:17.376 --> 16:18.968
What if it gets in the side?

16:19.144 --> 16:20.202
-Side?
-Yeah.

16:20.379 --> 16:23.576
Wouldn't it bounce back and forth
between your cornea and the mirror?

16:23.749 --> 16:25.979
Faster and faster,
getting more intense, until--

16:26.151 --> 16:27.175
All right.

16:27.353 --> 16:30.413
-It's in your eye now.
-What?

16:32.992 --> 16:34.857
<i>Hola,</i> Jerry.

16:35.027 --> 16:36.494
I'm into this Puerto Rican Day.

16:36.662 --> 16:39.961
The sights, the sounds.
The hot, spicy flavor of it all.

16:40.132 --> 16:42.430
It's <i>caliente,</i> Jerry.

16:42.601 --> 16:45.729
-The Mets got men on base.
-I know. I was watching the game.

16:45.904 --> 16:47.235
You were watching? Where?

16:47.406 --> 16:50.671
Oh, that was a strike.
Did you see that?

16:50.843 --> 16:53.937
Would you like to see the rest
of the apartment, Mr.--?

16:54.113 --> 16:56.877
Varnsen. Kel Varnsen.

16:57.049 --> 17:00.177
Actually, this room intrigues me.
Why is it called the TV room?

17:00.352 --> 17:02.650
-Well, it's--
-Balk? How was that a balk?

17:02.821 --> 17:04.083
You have any snacks?

17:04.256 --> 17:07.384
Mr. Varnsen, if you like the apartment,
I should tell you...

17:07.559 --> 17:10.357
...I've also had some interest
from a wealthy industrialist.

17:11.396 --> 17:12.796
Not Pennypacker.

17:12.964 --> 17:15.023
-You know him?
-I wish I didn't.

17:15.200 --> 17:17.464
Brace yourself, madam,
for an all-out bidding war.

17:17.636 --> 17:20.400
But this time, advantage Varnsen.

17:23.008 --> 17:24.942
-Wait a second.
-What?

17:25.477 --> 17:28.310
I think I see where that laser guy is.

17:28.480 --> 17:30.641
No, don't look, don't look.

17:31.050 --> 17:33.780
Oh, yeah, that's him.

17:33.952 --> 17:37.752
Okay. I'm gonna sneak up on him.

17:38.223 --> 17:41.784
Now the hunted
becomes the hunter.

17:44.630 --> 17:47.827
We should be able to get across
right through here.

17:49.001 --> 17:50.491
It's a dead end.

17:50.669 --> 17:52.864
-Oh, no. I thought--
-You thought?

17:53.038 --> 17:54.972
We're gonna die in the dark.
I knew it.

17:55.140 --> 17:58.200
-We're gonna die.
-Get ahold of yourself!

18:07.419 --> 18:08.852
Sorry.

18:09.888 --> 18:12.618
Somebody help us!

18:12.791 --> 18:14.782
<i>Mira, mira,</i> Stacy Keach!

18:14.960 --> 18:17.827
We're down here. Help.

18:17.996 --> 18:20.021
There's people down there.

18:20.199 --> 18:21.996
Hold on!

18:24.736 --> 18:28.433
Let us out. There's an unmarried
pregnant woman down here.

18:28.607 --> 18:30.507
Don't judge me.

18:31.443 --> 18:33.775
Help us up
so we can cross the street?

18:33.946 --> 18:37.382
No, no, you can't cross here.
There's a parade.

18:37.549 --> 18:40.040
But we've come so far.

18:40.219 --> 18:42.346
We just wanna unwind.

18:42.521 --> 18:43.852
Yeah, what can I tell you.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.222
Wanna make out some more?

18:49.394 --> 18:52.363
Oh, God! Let us out!

19:00.272 --> 19:01.739
Got it!

19:05.711 --> 19:07.372
That wasn't a laser pen.

19:07.546 --> 19:10.538
No. It's just a pen.

19:13.118 --> 19:14.517
Oh, that's funny?

19:14.686 --> 19:16.654
No, you have, like,
a dot on your face.

19:16.822 --> 19:19.188
Whoever's doing that is very clever.

19:21.793 --> 19:23.761
Come on, man.
You need to lighten up.

19:23.929 --> 19:26.557
Yeah, a feeling like this
only happens once a year.

19:27.166 --> 19:29.726
Yeah, it's like this every day
in Puerto Rico.

19:31.103 --> 19:34.561
Yeah, see, now you're getting
the spirit of it, huh?

19:44.249 --> 19:46.911
Hey. There's a guy burning
the Puerto Rican flag.

19:47.953 --> 19:50.421
Who? Who is burning the flag?

19:51.023 --> 19:52.388
Oh, no.

19:52.558 --> 19:55.584
-Him?
-That's not very nice.

19:55.761 --> 19:57.058
It was an accident.

19:57.229 --> 19:59.595
Do you know what day this is?

19:59.765 --> 20:02.165
Because I know what day this is.

20:02.334 --> 20:03.801
They know what day this is...

20:03.969 --> 20:07.700
...so I was wondering
if you know what day this is!

20:07.873 --> 20:09.397
Because it's Puerto Rican Day.

20:09.575 --> 20:14.035
Maybe we should stomp you
like you stomp the flag.

20:14.213 --> 20:15.942
-What do you think?
-All right, look.

20:16.114 --> 20:19.345
I just have one thing
to say to you boys.

20:19.518 --> 20:21.486
Mama!

20:21.653 --> 20:23.518
Get him.

20:25.490 --> 20:27.958
Right this way, Mr. Vandelay.

20:28.126 --> 20:30.856
Lovely, this is a lovely apartment.
Lovely.

20:31.029 --> 20:34.055
The kids are gonna go crazy.

20:34.233 --> 20:37.134
I wonder if I could see
the bathrooms.

20:37.302 --> 20:40.794
Preferably one with some paint thinner
and some rags?

20:41.473 --> 20:43.532
It's down the hall.

20:44.509 --> 20:47.103
Oh, hello, Art.

20:47.279 --> 20:49.338
Mr. Vandelay, of course.

20:49.514 --> 20:51.505
You two know each other?

20:53.085 --> 20:55.349
-Mr. Pennypacker.
-Yes.

20:55.520 --> 20:57.613
Oh, yeah, I wanted to stop by
and make sure...

20:57.789 --> 20:59.950
... that my shark tank fits--

21:00.125 --> 21:01.285
Hello.

21:01.460 --> 21:04.896
Mr. Pennypacker, this is Mr. Vandelay,
and you know Mr. Varnsen.

21:05.063 --> 21:06.496
-Varnsen.
-Pennypacker.

21:06.665 --> 21:08.326
-Vandelay.
-Pennypacker. Varnsen.

21:08.500 --> 21:10.195
Vandelay.

21:10.936 --> 21:13.404
Wait a second. Mr. Pennypacker,
if you're here...

21:13.572 --> 21:18.009
...and Mr. Vandelay is also here,
then who's watching the factory?

21:18.176 --> 21:21.145
-The factory?
-The Saab factory?

21:24.383 --> 21:26.613
Jerry, that's in Sweden.

21:26.785 --> 21:28.514
<i>The guy in here....</i>

21:29.721 --> 21:30.710
My car.

21:34.660 --> 21:37.561
Yeah. You know, it's like this
every day in Puerto Rico.

21:37.729 --> 21:39.993
Jerry, the Mets lost.

21:40.165 --> 21:42.827
I love a parade.

21:53.245 --> 21:55.679
How do you suppose they did that?

21:55.847 --> 21:59.806
Well, there's no logical
explanation.

22:00.752 --> 22:03.312
-All right, shall we go home?
-Well, what about my car?

22:03.488 --> 22:06.321
Well, Jerry, you can't deduct it now.

22:07.726 --> 22:08.886
Hey, there's Elaine.

22:09.061 --> 22:10.187
Hey.

22:10.362 --> 22:14.059
Well, you look relaxed.

22:14.900 --> 22:19.599
Well, it is Sunday night,
and you know how I like to unwind.

22:20.672 --> 22:22.037
Hey, black Saab.

22:22.207 --> 22:25.233
Looks like that building cut you off.

22:25.410 --> 22:26.934
See you around.

22:27.112 --> 22:29.603
-Well, at least he didn't--
-Jackass.

22:32.984 --> 22:35.418
Somebody remember
where we parked.

22:36.288 --> 22:39.951
Well, this was a fun day.
It's nice to get out.
