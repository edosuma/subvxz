00:01.335 --> 00:03.304
NARRATOR:
In the criminal justice system,

00:03.337 --> 00:06.107
sexually based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:06.140 --> 00:08.276
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:08.309 --> 00:10.278
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:10.311 --> 00:11.612
are members of an elite squad

00:11.645 --> 00:13.447
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:13.481 --> 00:16.150
These are their stories.

00:17.818 --> 00:18.752
Hit it!

00:18.786 --> 00:20.688
I'm just saying, it's
not real convenient

00:20.721 --> 00:22.623
for me to pay a mil
for an alcove studio.

00:22.656 --> 00:23.757
Got a doorman,
though, right?

00:23.791 --> 00:25.593
Doorman can kiss my ass.

00:25.626 --> 00:27.328
Keep the damn door shut,

00:27.361 --> 00:30.198
unless you are paying
the electric bill.

00:30.231 --> 00:31.565
( clanking )

00:31.599 --> 00:32.766
Something break?

00:32.800 --> 00:34.368
Uh, just ice off the trunk.

00:34.402 --> 00:35.803
We good.

00:37.438 --> 00:38.472
Look!

00:38.506 --> 00:40.341
Look at this.

00:42.710 --> 00:44.512
Is that blood?

00:44.545 --> 00:46.714
It's coming from
the trunk.

00:51.219 --> 00:53.454
Center, this is
tow truck one-one-four,

00:53.487 --> 00:55.089
requesting police
assistance.

00:55.123 --> 00:57.225
Caucasian female,
no I.D. or clothing.

00:57.258 --> 00:59.827
Car's been sitting here
since at least 6:00 a.m.,

00:59.860 --> 01:02.096
when Parking
Enforcement
ticketed it.

01:02.130 --> 01:03.764
Thanks.

01:03.797 --> 01:06.600
Notice how Warner always
sends out the assistants

01:06.634 --> 01:08.469
when it drops below 20?

01:08.502 --> 01:09.770
Cardillo, where is she?

01:09.803 --> 01:11.139
Probably drinking coffee

01:11.172 --> 01:12.840
and having a Danish
in her office.

01:12.873 --> 01:14.508
She doesn't like the cold.

01:14.542 --> 01:16.244
Yeah, who does?
What do we got?

01:16.277 --> 01:17.611
She's between 15 and 21.

01:17.645 --> 01:19.380
It's hard to say with the cold,

01:19.413 --> 01:21.849
but I'd say she's been dead
at least five hours.

01:21.882 --> 01:23.851
Stabbed and slashed
with a six-inch,

01:23.884 --> 01:25.486
very dull straight blade.

01:25.519 --> 01:27.855
I'm not sure what caused
the smaller cuts.

01:27.888 --> 01:29.223
There's at least
a hundred of them.

01:29.257 --> 01:30.090
These are
cigarette burns,

01:30.124 --> 01:33.261
plus multiple contusions
and head trauma.

01:33.294 --> 01:34.795
Everything inflicted
before she died?

01:34.828 --> 01:37.165
Probably. Her hands
and feet were duct taped,

01:37.198 --> 01:38.699
so that she
couldn't fight back.

01:38.732 --> 01:39.767
( whistles )

01:39.800 --> 01:42.870
From the amount of blood,
she was inside the trunk

01:42.903 --> 01:44.472
for most of the attack.

01:44.505 --> 01:46.774
Heat from the car
kept the trunk warm enough

01:46.807 --> 01:49.277
so that she bled to death
before she froze to death.

01:49.310 --> 01:51.179
How long did it
take for her to die?

01:51.212 --> 01:52.880
Three or four hours.
Maybe more.

01:52.913 --> 01:54.582
Detectives?

01:54.615 --> 01:56.550
Missing persons report
just came in

01:56.584 --> 01:58.586
from a Greg Sullivan
in Westchester.

01:58.619 --> 02:01.555
His 16-year-old daughter
never showed up for school.

02:01.589 --> 02:02.890
Think she's our victim?

02:02.923 --> 02:05.393
This car's registered
to a Gregory Sullivan.

02:05.426 --> 02:06.627
Daughter had it last.

02:06.660 --> 02:08.729
Looks like we found her.

02:11.765 --> 02:15.836
Captioning sponsored by
UNIVERSAL NETWORK TELEVISION

02:15.869 --> 02:19.840
and NBC

02:59.247 --> 03:00.781
My wife's out of
town on business.

03:00.814 --> 03:03.651
She's trying to
get a flight back.

03:03.684 --> 03:05.253
BENSON:
Why didn't you
call the police

03:05.286 --> 03:06.587
when Emily didn't
come home last night?

03:06.620 --> 03:08.522
I let her spend the night
at a friend's.

03:08.556 --> 03:10.591
They have a history project
due next week.

03:10.624 --> 03:11.659
I just don't understand

03:11.692 --> 03:14.295
why she would've gone
into the city last night.

03:14.328 --> 03:16.264
She doesn't even have
her night license.

03:16.297 --> 03:17.498
Maybe this is a mistake.

03:17.531 --> 03:18.799
Do you have

03:18.832 --> 03:21.435
that friend's name?
Andrea Kent.
I've been calling

03:21.469 --> 03:23.337
the Kents all morning,
but there's no answer.

03:23.371 --> 03:24.538
And you're sure
that she was

03:24.572 --> 03:25.639
at their house?

03:25.673 --> 03:27.308
I assume so.
I left a message

03:27.341 --> 03:29.843
on their answering machine
last night around 9:00,

03:29.877 --> 03:31.812
to say good night to Emily.

03:31.845 --> 03:35.383
And she called me back
15 minutes later.

03:35.416 --> 03:36.650
Oh, God.

03:36.684 --> 03:39.253
She was never at
the Kents', was she?

03:39.287 --> 03:41.689
Mr. Sullivan, could we have
that number you called?

03:43.391 --> 03:45.493
Elliot?

03:50.764 --> 03:53.767
It's her, isn't it?

03:55.769 --> 03:57.638
WOMAN:
Greg Sullivan said

03:57.671 --> 03:59.440
Emily slept over
on a school night?

03:59.473 --> 04:00.341
Not a chance.

04:00.374 --> 04:02.376
But Emily told her
father that she was

04:02.410 --> 04:04.312
spending the night
over at your house.

04:04.345 --> 04:05.313
Well, then she's lying.

04:05.346 --> 04:06.747
Did something happen
to her?

04:06.780 --> 04:10.418
Mrs. Kent, Emily was murdered
last night.

04:10.451 --> 04:11.585
Oh, my God.
How awful.

04:11.619 --> 04:13.421
Andrea's going to be
so upset.

04:13.454 --> 04:15.789
Can you tell us where your
daughter was last night?

04:15.823 --> 04:17.057
Home. All evening.

04:17.090 --> 04:18.892
Did her homework
and went to bed early.

04:18.926 --> 04:21.429
You didn't, by any chance,
happen to get any messages

04:21.462 --> 04:23.063
from the Sullivans today,
did you?

04:23.096 --> 04:23.931
No.

04:23.964 --> 04:25.599
Can you take a look
at that number?

04:25.633 --> 04:26.600
You recognize
that one?

04:26.634 --> 04:28.369
Doesn't even look familiar.

04:28.402 --> 04:31.038
I'm sorry, I'm terribly late.
I wish I could help.

04:31.071 --> 04:33.374
You know, we'd love
to talk to Andrea

04:33.407 --> 04:35.443
about Emily's
whereabouts
last night.

04:35.476 --> 04:36.377
Please do.

04:36.410 --> 04:37.711
She's at school.

04:37.745 --> 04:40.314
And I hope you scare
the hell out of her.

04:40.348 --> 04:43.417
This is what happens
when kids lie to their parents.

04:45.819 --> 04:48.088
MAN:
The whole school's in mourning.

04:48.121 --> 04:49.323
Emily was well liked?

04:49.357 --> 04:52.626
She was one of those kids who
was friends with everybody.

04:52.660 --> 04:54.362
You know,
student body treasurer,

04:54.395 --> 04:56.464
half a dozen clubs,
Homecoming Court.

04:56.497 --> 04:57.765
She was a real shining star.

04:57.798 --> 04:59.667
Were you able to
locate Andrea Kent?

04:59.700 --> 05:02.536
Ah, I was able
to pull her and a few

05:02.570 --> 05:05.105
of Emily's other close friends
from their classes.

05:05.138 --> 05:07.541
You have the school's
full cooperation.

05:12.813 --> 05:16.950
Paige Summerbee,
Brittany O'Malley,
Andrea Kent.

05:16.984 --> 05:19.387
These are Detectives
Benson and Stabler.

05:19.420 --> 05:21.655
Andrea, when's the
last time you saw Emily?

05:21.689 --> 05:24.925
Yesterday, at school.

05:24.958 --> 05:26.960
Do you know why
she told her parents

05:26.994 --> 05:29.930
that she was sleeping over
at your house last night?

05:29.963 --> 05:31.799
No.

05:31.832 --> 05:33.867
We didn't plan that.

05:33.901 --> 05:38.406
Do any of you girls recognize
this number?

05:38.439 --> 05:41.041
It's the number
Emily's dad called last night.

05:43.977 --> 05:45.145
Can I use your phone?

05:45.178 --> 05:47.581
PRINCIPAL:
Of course.

05:56.557 --> 05:58.025
( clears throat )

05:58.058 --> 06:00.027
( phone ringing )

06:00.060 --> 06:01.862
( cell phone beeps )

06:01.895 --> 06:04.565
( sniffles )

06:04.598 --> 06:07.568
You know what? Why don't we let
that go to voicemail?

06:07.601 --> 06:11.071
GIRL:
Hi, you've reached the Kents.
Please leave a message.

06:11.104 --> 06:14.575
( beep )

06:14.608 --> 06:15.743
I'm so sorry.

06:15.776 --> 06:19.480
I'm so sorry.
She asked me to do it.

06:19.513 --> 06:21.415
Just tell us what happened.

06:21.449 --> 06:24.017
Emily was afraid
she'd get caught if
she tried to sneak out.

06:24.051 --> 06:26.520
So, when Emily's parents
called your cell phone,

06:26.554 --> 06:27.955
you call Emily
and she calls home?

06:27.988 --> 06:29.490
It's all my fault.

06:29.523 --> 06:31.525
STABLER:
What was so important

06:31.559 --> 06:34.528
that Emily had to
get out of the house?

06:34.562 --> 06:36.764
She was supposed to have
some big romantic date.

06:36.797 --> 06:38.599
BENSON:
You know
the date's name?

06:38.632 --> 06:39.633
Just that he was, like, 23.

06:39.667 --> 06:41.134
Now, Brittany,
you must've talked

06:41.168 --> 06:43.070
to Emily last night,
when her parents called you.

06:43.103 --> 06:44.071
For like a second.

06:44.104 --> 06:46.173
But I don't know
where she was.

06:46.206 --> 06:48.442
And I shouldn't have done it.

06:48.476 --> 06:50.544
Okay, maybe she'd be alive.

06:50.578 --> 06:52.045
I'm so...

06:52.079 --> 06:54.982
( sobbing )

06:55.015 --> 06:56.149
Oh, my God!

06:56.183 --> 06:57.918
PRINCIPAL:
Is there anything
else you need?

06:57.951 --> 07:00.488
The combination
to Emily's locker.

07:02.022 --> 07:04.625
This girl was living
the perfect high school life.

07:04.658 --> 07:05.392
Gotta throw it all away

07:05.425 --> 07:07.761
by dating
some 20-something skeve.

07:07.795 --> 07:11.565
It's her day-planner.
Let's see...

07:11.599 --> 07:12.933
Nothing for yesterday.

07:12.966 --> 07:15.002
Got plenty
of numbers, though.

07:15.035 --> 07:18.138
You know, Brittany
called Emily on her
cell phone last night.

07:18.171 --> 07:19.973
But CSU never found
it in the car.

07:20.007 --> 07:21.575
Well, killer
could've taken it.

07:21.609 --> 07:23.577
Let's hope he's dumb enough
to use it.

07:23.611 --> 07:27.548
Hey, look! She's got a bunch of
photos on this digital camera.

07:29.783 --> 07:32.586
I think I just found
our 20-something skeve.

07:32.620 --> 07:34.688
So did I.

07:35.723 --> 07:37.591
That's him.
Lukas Ian Croft.

07:37.625 --> 07:38.826
What is he,
an actor?

07:38.859 --> 07:40.494
( sprightly music playing )

07:40.528 --> 07:41.629
MAN:
For God's sake!

07:41.662 --> 07:43.497
It's an energy drink!

07:43.531 --> 07:47.100
Banana, apple,
you're happy,
you're peppy.

07:47.134 --> 07:48.101
Come on!

07:48.135 --> 07:49.637
We're shooting
here, folks.

07:49.670 --> 07:51.672
You're gonna have to
walk around.

07:51.705 --> 07:53.140
We need to talk
to the grapes.

07:53.173 --> 07:55.142
Copy that.
Lukas? Visitors.

07:55.175 --> 07:57.978
Police.
Come on down.

07:58.011 --> 08:00.080
We need you to answer
a few questions for us.

08:00.113 --> 08:00.981
Uh, what's this about?

08:01.014 --> 08:04.217
Emily Sullivan.
Your underaged girlfriend.

08:04.251 --> 08:05.953
Look, we had
a couple of dates.

08:05.986 --> 08:07.821
I didn't know
she was only 16.

08:07.855 --> 08:10.057
As soon as I found out,
I broke it off.

08:10.090 --> 08:13.126
I bet all the young girls love
that you're a... an actor.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.195
I don't date girls,
usually.

08:15.228 --> 08:16.864
I mean, on purpose.

08:16.897 --> 08:19.132
Come on, have you seen Emily?

08:19.166 --> 08:20.768
She looks like... 20.

08:20.801 --> 08:22.536
Now she looks dead.

08:22.570 --> 08:24.838
Know anything
about that?

08:24.872 --> 08:26.674
No... God.
What happened?

08:26.707 --> 08:29.543
She came into the city
last night to meet you.

08:29.577 --> 08:30.578
She got murdered.

08:30.611 --> 08:32.312
No, I swear, we broke up.

08:32.345 --> 08:33.781
I was on a movie set last night.

08:33.814 --> 08:36.617
You're in a movie?

08:37.284 --> 08:38.719
I'm an extra.

08:38.752 --> 08:41.254
I was there
till 4:00 in the morning.

08:44.124 --> 08:45.292
Little fruit's alibi checks out.

08:45.325 --> 08:48.829
I want to know where the hell
this girl was last night.

08:48.862 --> 08:50.297
There's no activity
on her ATM

08:50.330 --> 08:51.599
or her credit card.

08:51.632 --> 08:53.266
Nobody saw her,
and if she wasn't

08:53.300 --> 08:55.202
meeting Lukas,
then why sneak out?

08:55.235 --> 08:56.970
TARU's checking out
her computer now.

08:57.004 --> 08:58.005
Maybe she met
someone online.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.840
HUANG:
Look at the
neck wounds.

08:59.873 --> 09:01.975
Too shallow to kill
her outright, but
she bleeds enough

09:02.009 --> 09:03.176
to make her too
weak to fight back.

09:03.210 --> 09:04.612
BENSON:
He wanted to watch
her suffer.

09:04.645 --> 09:07.848
I'll check with VICAP
to see if any other
murders match this M.O.

09:07.881 --> 09:10.618
Emily Sullivan's
cellular company
just reported

09:10.651 --> 09:13.353
an outgoing call on her
phone to a 900 sex line.

09:13.386 --> 09:16.056
GPS tracked it to within
a hundred yards.

09:16.089 --> 09:18.358
Closest possibility
is a comic book shop.

09:18.391 --> 09:20.093
Psychos...

09:20.127 --> 09:22.863
they always love comics.

09:25.298 --> 09:27.134
MAN:
So, you look like
Kathleen Turner, huh?

09:27.167 --> 09:31.071
Like, when she was skinny?
Oh, yeah, that's so hot.

09:31.104 --> 09:33.273
So, uh, what do you...?

09:33.306 --> 09:35.709
This is a nice
pink cell phone.

09:35.743 --> 09:37.277
You're under arrest
there, Emily.

09:37.310 --> 09:38.712
For what?

09:38.746 --> 09:40.147
For the murder
of Emily Sullivan.

09:40.180 --> 09:41.949
No, wait, wait, wait.
I found that phone.

09:41.982 --> 09:43.651
I was out of town
till this morning.

09:43.684 --> 09:44.818
Yeah? Where?

09:44.852 --> 09:46.754
Uh, Cosmicon,
Grand Rapids.

09:46.787 --> 09:48.388
Plane ticket stub's
in my back pocket.

09:48.421 --> 09:51.224
Please, I'll pay for the calls,
but I didn't kill anybody.

09:51.258 --> 09:53.226
Where did you pick up
the cell phone?

09:53.260 --> 09:55.929
In the street,
couple blocks away.

09:55.963 --> 09:57.798
Oh, hey, this is
a murder case!

09:57.831 --> 09:59.633
You tell me
what's going down?

09:59.667 --> 10:00.968
No.

10:01.001 --> 10:02.736
That's cool.
Police business. I dig.

10:02.770 --> 10:05.005
This is not far
from where the body was found.

10:05.038 --> 10:06.239
Text message
from yesterday--

10:06.273 --> 10:08.842
"C U later, Brit."

10:08.876 --> 10:11.011
You know, my daughter
text messages

10:11.044 --> 10:12.646
her friends 20
times a day.

10:12.680 --> 10:16.116
I wonder how long
the phone company
keeps those records.

10:16.149 --> 10:16.984
You're in luck.

10:17.017 --> 10:18.852
They archive text
messages 14 days.

10:18.886 --> 10:20.420
There's gotta be
thousands of them here.

10:20.453 --> 10:22.322
How did she have time
to do anything else?

10:22.355 --> 10:24.157
Hmm. Trick is
to memorize the keypad,

10:24.191 --> 10:25.759
so you can text message
during class

10:25.793 --> 10:27.094
without looking
at your phone.

10:27.127 --> 10:28.161
My niece is 14.

10:28.195 --> 10:30.931
Right. This stuff
is very deep.

10:30.964 --> 10:34.401
"Danny is sooooo--"
ten o's-- "ooooo cute."

10:34.434 --> 10:36.103
Listen to this.

10:36.136 --> 10:37.771
"Keep your fat mouth shut."

10:37.805 --> 10:39.172
And then later that day--

10:39.206 --> 10:42.242
"We're all just waiting
for you to kill yourself."

10:42.275 --> 10:43.844
There's pages of this.

10:43.877 --> 10:44.945
Who sent them?

10:44.978 --> 10:46.113
Emily. To somebody else.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.280
Is there any way to find out

10:47.314 --> 10:49.249
who she sent
these messages to?

10:49.282 --> 10:51.284
Yeah.

10:53.486 --> 10:55.222
( knocking )

10:58.325 --> 10:59.059
Help you?

10:59.092 --> 11:00.928
Mr. Linsky,
I'm Detective Benson.

11:00.961 --> 11:02.129
This is
Detective Stabler.

11:02.162 --> 11:03.764
Do you have a daughter
named Agnes?

11:03.797 --> 11:05.098
Yeah.

11:05.132 --> 11:07.768
Is she friends
with an Emily Sullivan?

11:07.801 --> 11:08.702
You guys know damn well

11:08.736 --> 11:10.771
that bitch is not
my daughter's friend.

11:10.804 --> 11:12.806
Go bother her parents.
They deserve it.

11:12.840 --> 11:14.775
Uh, Mr. Linsky,
just hold on a second.

11:14.808 --> 11:16.476
We're from
Manhattan Special Victims.

11:16.509 --> 11:18.145
Emily Sullivan was murdered.

11:18.178 --> 11:19.813
Now, why don't you
explain to us

11:19.847 --> 11:21.715
what you're
talking about?

11:21.749 --> 11:24.217
Troy, get lost.

11:24.251 --> 11:26.854
We've been trying to get
a restraining order

11:26.887 --> 11:28.856
against that girl
for over a year.

11:28.889 --> 11:29.890
And nobody cared.

11:29.923 --> 11:31.258
Now someone kills her,

11:31.291 --> 11:34.094
and you're acting like
it's some kind of tragedy?

11:34.127 --> 11:36.329
She made my daughter's
life miserable.

11:36.363 --> 11:40.033
And God help me,
I'm not sorry she's dead.

11:46.974 --> 11:47.941
Why didn't you tell us
that Agnes Linsky's father

11:48.608 --> 11:50.310
tried to get a restraining order

11:50.343 --> 11:51.211
against Emily two months ago?

11:51.244 --> 11:53.413
I'm sorry, I didn't think
it was relevant.

11:53.446 --> 11:54.447
Allegations
of phone harassment,

11:54.481 --> 11:56.950
persistent verbal abuse--
that's not relevant?

11:56.984 --> 11:59.419
The judge didn't find
any merits to the claims;
neither did I.

11:59.452 --> 12:01.922
And now that Emily's
dead, you think there
might be some merit?

12:01.955 --> 12:03.957
You think we might've
wanted to hear about it?
No.

12:03.991 --> 12:05.959
No?
This was just
an overprotective father

12:05.993 --> 12:07.861
getting involved
in a misunderstanding

12:07.895 --> 12:09.396
between two teenagers--
not murder.

12:09.429 --> 12:11.965
Did you bother to investigate
the allegations?

12:11.999 --> 12:13.200
We set up a mediation

12:13.233 --> 12:14.334
between Emily and Agnes.

12:14.367 --> 12:17.270
Both girls agreed to try harder
to understand each other

12:17.304 --> 12:21.074
Detectives, Agnes
Linsky may be delayed,
academically

12:21.108 --> 12:23.310
and socially, but she
couldn't kill anyone.

12:23.343 --> 12:25.012
We're gonna need
to talk to her.

12:25.045 --> 12:26.346
We'll get her father
down here.

12:26.379 --> 12:28.248
That's not necessary.
Agnes is 18.

12:28.281 --> 12:30.851
I'll pull her out of class.

12:34.154 --> 12:36.189
No use in both of us
tag-teaming her.

12:36.223 --> 12:38.291
Just take it.

12:41.361 --> 12:44.431
Hey, Agnes.

12:44.464 --> 12:46.433
I'm Detective Benson.

12:46.466 --> 12:49.069
I know. You were
at my house last night.

12:49.102 --> 12:52.339
Mm-hmm.
I don't know what
happened to Emily--
we're not friends.

12:52.372 --> 12:54.574
Well, your principal said
that you two don't get along.

12:54.607 --> 12:56.209
Yeah. Well, he spends

12:56.243 --> 12:59.546
most of his time kissing
Emily and her friends' asses.

12:59.579 --> 13:03.450
I know you don't believe me.
Nobody does.

13:06.987 --> 13:09.156
You know, Agnes,
I want to help you.

13:09.189 --> 13:10.490
Right.

13:10.523 --> 13:12.225
You're gonna be my friend.

13:12.259 --> 13:14.394
And if you and I
were in school together,

13:14.427 --> 13:17.464
you'd be just as
much of a bitch as
the rest of them.

13:17.497 --> 13:19.532
Well, actually,
when I was in school,

13:19.566 --> 13:22.169
I pretty much kept to myself.

13:22.202 --> 13:24.504
I didn't want anybody
to find out about my mom.

13:24.537 --> 13:27.140
She, uh, used to drink a lot.

13:28.208 --> 13:30.377
It's easier not
having friends,

13:30.410 --> 13:34.347
but it doesn't make it
any less lonely.

13:38.451 --> 13:42.522
My mom died... when I was nine.

13:42.555 --> 13:45.025
When I was 12,
Emily started the rumor

13:45.058 --> 13:49.096
that my mom left us because she
couldn't stand how ugly I was.

13:49.129 --> 13:50.497
Funny, right?

13:50.530 --> 13:53.233
People still
believe that.

13:53.266 --> 13:55.435
So you've known Emily
a long time.

13:55.468 --> 13:58.105
When we were little,
we were all friends.

13:58.138 --> 14:02.409
I don't really know
why it changed.

14:02.442 --> 14:05.345
In seventh grade,
Emily got a fake screen name

14:05.378 --> 14:08.381
and pretended to be
a boy I liked, e-mailed me.

14:08.415 --> 14:10.083
The next day I talked to him,

14:10.117 --> 14:12.419
and he didn't know
what the hell I was saying.

14:12.452 --> 14:14.621
He pushed me into the mud.

14:14.654 --> 14:17.958
Emily and her friends
thought it was hilarious.

14:17.991 --> 14:19.559
So her friends
were in on it, too?

14:19.592 --> 14:21.962
Brittany and the rest of them
are pretty terrible,

14:21.995 --> 14:26.033
but I was Emily's
special project.

14:26.066 --> 14:28.435
She used to pretend
to be my friend for a week,

14:28.468 --> 14:31.004
and then use it against me.

14:31.038 --> 14:33.240
I gave her my cell phone number,

14:33.273 --> 14:37.310
and she started sending
all these awful messages to me--

14:37.344 --> 14:39.246
how fat I was,

14:39.279 --> 14:44.017
how I should just kill myself
because nobody liked me.

14:44.051 --> 14:46.453
My dad saved up
to buy me that phone,

14:46.486 --> 14:48.956
and I hardly use it anymore.

14:48.989 --> 14:51.091
It's not worth it.

14:52.359 --> 14:55.028
Your dad seems pretty angry
about this.

14:55.062 --> 14:57.030
It's like

14:57.064 --> 14:58.966
I'm disappointing him.

14:58.999 --> 15:01.634
That's the worst part, you know?

15:01.668 --> 15:03.536
( sniffles ):
It sounds stupid.

15:03.570 --> 15:06.039
My brother says
I should ignore it...

15:06.073 --> 15:08.375
but it just builds up.

15:08.408 --> 15:10.210
Every day it's something else.

15:10.243 --> 15:12.512
And you start to feel
like you don't even want

15:12.545 --> 15:15.582
to get out of bed
in the morning.

15:15.615 --> 15:20.220
I know it sounds awful, but...
I'm happy.

15:20.253 --> 15:22.689
I'm happy she's dead.

15:27.660 --> 15:29.262
Yep.

15:29.296 --> 15:31.531
Pat Linsky was bartending
from 8:00 until 4:00

15:31.564 --> 15:33.266
the night of Emily's murder.

15:33.300 --> 15:35.135
Agnes says that
she was home alone.

15:35.168 --> 15:37.537
We really think
she's capable of
something like that?

15:37.570 --> 15:38.738
If pushed hard enough.

15:38.771 --> 15:40.273
The sadistic nature
of the attack

15:40.307 --> 15:41.741
could also be explained
by the fury

15:41.774 --> 15:43.443
of someone who doesn't
know how to kill.

15:43.476 --> 15:46.279
Look, the school knew exactly
what was happening to that girl.

15:46.313 --> 15:47.547
They didn't do anything
about it.

15:47.580 --> 15:50.317
Victims of bullying are
often social outcasts.

15:50.350 --> 15:52.185
It's human nature for
the school authorities

15:52.219 --> 15:53.520
to identify with
the "normal" kids.

15:53.553 --> 15:55.522
Meaning the teachers
believe the bully's story

15:55.555 --> 15:58.191
and think the victims are being
a little too sensitive.

15:58.225 --> 16:00.027
I don't know.
Agnes had every reason

16:00.060 --> 16:01.461
to hate Emily
and want her dead.

16:01.494 --> 16:03.430
I just don't think
she killed her.

16:03.463 --> 16:05.365
We're sure the father's
in the clear?

16:05.398 --> 16:06.399
Well, we'll check the bar.

16:06.433 --> 16:08.168
Maybe he took
a long lunch break.

16:08.201 --> 16:09.236
STABLER:
We'll be right there.

16:09.269 --> 16:11.504
Brittany O'Malley was just
attacked at Tanner Day.

16:11.538 --> 16:13.006
She's on her way to the E.R.

16:13.040 --> 16:14.141
Security's holding
the guy who did it.

16:14.174 --> 16:15.708
Olivia, hit the hospital.

16:15.742 --> 16:17.744
Get to the school.

16:19.779 --> 16:22.782
MAN:
Here's the tough guy.

16:22.815 --> 16:25.552
STABLER:
Ah... you're
Agnes Linsky's brother.

16:25.585 --> 16:27.487
Troy Linsky.
Expelled three years ago

16:27.520 --> 16:29.256
for bringing a knife
into school.

16:29.289 --> 16:31.124
Also likes to beat up
little girls.

16:31.158 --> 16:33.493
I didn't
beat her up.
Shut up.

16:33.526 --> 16:36.396
I'll let you two
get acquainted.

16:41.501 --> 16:43.103
I pushed her,
that's it.

16:43.136 --> 16:45.305
Hard enough to send her
to the hospital.

16:45.338 --> 16:47.040
She hit her head
against the locker.

16:47.074 --> 16:48.508
It was an accident.
I was mad.

16:48.541 --> 16:51.144
You've got some
anger management
problems there, pal.

16:51.178 --> 16:53.480
Yeah, do you know what
they did to my sister?

16:53.513 --> 16:55.482
Yeah, Emily Sullivan tortured
your sister-- I know that.

16:55.515 --> 16:57.517
And someone taught
that bitch a lesson, right?

16:57.550 --> 17:00.520
It wasn't me.
I didn't touch Emily.

17:00.553 --> 17:02.589
I'm not saying
you did, but...

17:02.622 --> 17:04.591
why are you beating up
Brittany?

17:04.624 --> 17:06.293
Look, I want Brittany to admit
what she did.

17:06.326 --> 17:08.728
What's that?

17:08.761 --> 17:10.730
She took pictures...

17:10.763 --> 17:13.233
while Agnes was changing
in the locker room.

17:13.266 --> 17:17.404
She sent them to anyone
with a camera phone.

17:17.437 --> 17:19.572
Look for yourself.

17:19.606 --> 17:21.574
On my cell,
in the bag on the desk.

17:25.778 --> 17:28.581
You know,
those girls...

17:28.615 --> 17:31.084
they've got everybody snowed.

17:31.118 --> 17:32.619
They're evil.

17:38.525 --> 17:40.260
How do you know
Brittany did this?

17:40.293 --> 17:41.628
She's in the same
class with Agnes.

17:41.661 --> 17:43.130
You know,
Brittany sent that

17:43.163 --> 17:46.633
to, like, 20 different people.

17:46.666 --> 17:49.802
My buddy's sister got it.
He sent it to me.

17:49.836 --> 17:52.372
And you think this is enough
to hurt someone, huh?

17:52.405 --> 17:54.241
Hey, look,
nobody's protecting my sister.

17:54.274 --> 17:55.508
Okay? Not the school
and not the cops.

17:55.542 --> 17:57.877
I'm trying to help your sister.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.546
Okay? I'm trying to help Agnes.

17:59.579 --> 18:01.148
Well, taking
naked pictures

18:01.181 --> 18:04.517
of someone,
well, that's illegal, right?

18:04.551 --> 18:07.787
So when are you gonna
do something about that?

18:09.289 --> 18:10.890
BENSON:
I'll wait for it.

18:10.923 --> 18:13.726
That was my partner.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.728
He's with Troy Linsky now.

18:15.762 --> 18:17.897
I want him arrested--
assault and battery.

18:17.930 --> 18:19.599
No, forget it.
Brit...

18:19.632 --> 18:21.168
Shut up!
Find the plastic surgeon--

18:21.201 --> 18:22.435
I want to get out of here.

18:22.469 --> 18:24.871
MRS. O'MALLEY:
Of course, sweetheart.

18:24.904 --> 18:27.840
They were never
anything but nice
to that Agnes girl,

18:27.874 --> 18:30.310
and this is what they get.

18:36.683 --> 18:38.418
Is your head feeling all right?

18:38.451 --> 18:39.919
No, it kills.

18:39.952 --> 18:42.822
I just don't
want a scar.

18:42.855 --> 18:44.624
I think it's gonna be
just fine.

18:44.657 --> 18:46.926
Oh, well, thank you, Doctor.

18:46.959 --> 18:48.595
You can leave now.

18:48.628 --> 18:52.332
You know what, honey, I will.

18:52.365 --> 18:55.268
But not before I ask you
a couple of questions.

18:58.505 --> 19:01.241
Why do you think
Troy Linsky attacked you?

19:01.274 --> 19:03.276
Because he's psycho.

19:03.310 --> 19:05.478
'Cause his whole family
is crazy.

19:05.512 --> 19:08.181
Did you see Agnes today?

19:08.215 --> 19:10.283
She's kind of hard to miss.

19:10.317 --> 19:11.884
Did you talk to her?
Why would I?

19:11.918 --> 19:13.520
Well, you know what,
Brittany?

19:13.553 --> 19:15.322
I'm starting to wonder why it is

19:15.355 --> 19:18.725
you girls do any of the things
that you do.

19:20.660 --> 19:22.829
Did you take this picture
of Agnes

19:22.862 --> 19:24.864
and send it around
to your friends?

19:24.897 --> 19:27.467
Keep in mind that
we can trace it back
to the sender--

19:27.500 --> 19:31.204
in case you're thinking
about lying to me again.

19:31.238 --> 19:33.340
Look at it.

19:35.908 --> 19:38.945
( crying ):
I'm sorry I did it.

19:38.978 --> 19:41.248
Why would you do that, Brittany?

19:41.281 --> 19:43.416
To get back at Agnes!

19:43.450 --> 19:44.417
To back at her for what?

19:44.451 --> 19:46.453
Everybody knows that
you spoke to her today.

19:46.486 --> 19:48.321
Because she did it,
didn't she?

19:48.355 --> 19:50.623
She did it.
She killed Emily.

19:50.657 --> 19:53.360
She killed my best friend!

19:59.332 --> 20:00.600
SIPER:
Why the rush, Detectives?

20:00.633 --> 20:02.602
We've got a bunch
of teenagers trying
to kill each other.

20:02.635 --> 20:04.437
I'd like to, uh,
arrest one of them.

20:04.471 --> 20:06.373
It would help
if we could at least

20:06.406 --> 20:08.408
narrow down
the killer's gender.

20:08.441 --> 20:10.677
Well, the small wounds
on the body

20:10.710 --> 20:14.881
were wider at the deepest point,
narrower at the entry point.

20:14.914 --> 20:18.518
Best guess is they came from
manicure scissors like these,

20:18.551 --> 20:21.521
shoved in and then opened up.

20:21.554 --> 20:22.755
Combine that with this,

20:22.789 --> 20:25.258
found inside
some of the scratch wounds.

20:25.292 --> 20:26.559
It's nail polish

20:26.593 --> 20:29.296
in Boy Crush Blush,
also known as

20:29.329 --> 20:30.463
light pink.

20:30.497 --> 20:32.432
I'd say your killer's a female.

20:32.465 --> 20:34.734
Or metrosexual.

20:34.767 --> 20:38.405
Once you've got a suspect,
I'm gonna make you really happy.

20:38.438 --> 20:40.940
We've got hair-- couple strands
stuck in the duct tape.

20:40.973 --> 20:43.743
It's been color-treated.

20:43.776 --> 20:45.712
Know any bottle blondes?

20:47.514 --> 20:51.951
Three.

20:51.984 --> 20:53.753
Question for you, Doc.

20:53.786 --> 20:55.722
Under what circumstances
would Miss Teen USA

20:55.755 --> 20:57.790
commit a violent murder
with sexual undertones?

20:57.824 --> 20:59.659
Well, that depends.

20:59.692 --> 21:01.794
She might have been sexually
abused herself, or psychotic.

21:01.828 --> 21:03.796
That also explain
why she'd kill one
of her best friends?

21:03.830 --> 21:05.064
It could.

21:05.097 --> 21:08.301
Boys tend to get into conflicts
with acquaintances or strangers.

21:08.335 --> 21:10.770
Girls typically attack within
tightly knit friendships.

21:10.803 --> 21:12.872
Well, that's definitely been
my experience.

21:12.905 --> 21:15.408
The people that have made me
feel the worst

21:15.442 --> 21:16.976
were always my best friends.

21:17.009 --> 21:18.578
It's called
relational aggression.

21:18.611 --> 21:20.647
Boys are socialized
to express their anger.

21:20.680 --> 21:22.014
Girls are socialized
to be nice--

21:22.048 --> 21:23.983
and it's not nice
to start a fight.

21:24.016 --> 21:25.552
Feelings got
to come out sometime.

21:25.585 --> 21:27.654
HUANG:
Often as rumor-spreading,
ostracizing,

21:27.687 --> 21:28.488
or secret-telling.

21:28.521 --> 21:30.523
In other words,
don't tell your friend

21:30.557 --> 21:31.358
you're mad at her,

21:31.391 --> 21:33.025
just get everybody else
to hate her.

21:33.059 --> 21:34.026
And in the extreme,

21:34.060 --> 21:36.596
I can see how a betrayal
within the inner circle

21:36.629 --> 21:37.697
could incite violence.

21:37.730 --> 21:39.399
Question is,
what was the betrayal?

21:39.432 --> 21:40.700
And which one did the deed?

21:40.733 --> 21:42.001
BENSON:
Maybe it was
all of them.

21:42.034 --> 21:44.003
Obviously none of these girls
have any qualms

21:44.036 --> 21:45.438
about lying to the police.

21:45.472 --> 21:46.606
We've got the hair
on the duct tape.

21:46.639 --> 21:47.740
It's got to belong
to one of them.

21:47.774 --> 21:49.075
We bring in all three now,

21:49.108 --> 21:50.943
they'll just keep up the lie

21:50.977 --> 21:52.512
or start pointing fingers.

21:52.545 --> 21:54.781
We need ammo to shoot their
story down.

21:54.814 --> 21:55.848
I love these little cliques.

21:55.882 --> 21:58.385
They're like the Mafia...
nobody knows nothing.

21:58.418 --> 21:59.185
Peer counselors might.

21:59.218 --> 22:00.687
Those kids usually know
everybody.

22:00.720 --> 22:02.622
Does the school have a
peer counseling program?

22:02.655 --> 22:04.857
Yeah, I think I saw a sign
for something like that.

22:04.891 --> 22:06.526
Good. Doc, why don't
you tag along,

22:06.559 --> 22:08.395
see if you can't get in
these kids' heads.

22:11.931 --> 22:15.034
Oh, yeah, I totally know
Brittany and all those girls.

22:15.067 --> 22:15.835
Everybody does.

22:15.868 --> 22:17.904
Has anyone had
any trouble with them?

22:17.937 --> 22:19.906
Um... except this is like
therapy,

22:19.939 --> 22:22.108
so I can't really
break a confidence.

22:22.141 --> 22:23.109
Okay.

22:23.142 --> 22:24.677
So what do you
think of them?

22:24.711 --> 22:25.712
Actually, they're
really nice.

22:25.745 --> 22:29.148
I can totally see
how somebody with, you know,

22:29.181 --> 22:31.884
low self-esteem would have
a problem with them.

22:31.918 --> 22:33.052
I don't.

22:33.085 --> 22:34.887
But you know people who do.

22:34.921 --> 22:35.888
Well, yeah.

22:35.922 --> 22:36.923
But what I say
to them is,

22:36.956 --> 22:38.958
hey, we're all insecure.

22:38.991 --> 22:42.962
Brittany and Paige and Andrea
are just like you.

22:42.995 --> 22:45.665
It's their defense mechanism.

22:45.698 --> 22:48.835
Right. What's their
defense mechanism?

22:48.868 --> 22:51.971
You know... being mean.

22:52.004 --> 22:54.707
There's a lot of pressure
being popular.

22:54.741 --> 22:58.411
Everyone always watching you,
waiting for you to screw up.

22:58.445 --> 23:00.046
It was really hard on Emily.

23:00.079 --> 23:03.049
Do you think that's an
excuse for bad behavior?

23:03.082 --> 23:05.117
No.

23:05.151 --> 23:08.054
I guess I just
understood Emily

23:08.087 --> 23:09.188
better
than most people.

23:09.221 --> 23:10.423
So you were friends?

23:10.457 --> 23:12.859
Well, we lived
next door to each other
since nursery school.

23:12.892 --> 23:15.895
We used to play together
all the time.

23:15.928 --> 23:19.966
She got in with the popular
crowd in middle school

23:19.999 --> 23:22.101
and I didn't see her
as much.

23:22.134 --> 23:24.704
I guess we were home friends.

23:24.737 --> 23:26.172
Sounds kind of lame.

23:26.205 --> 23:27.173
Not at all, Terri.

23:27.206 --> 23:28.708
Friendships are
always changing.

23:28.741 --> 23:31.511
What's sad is,

23:31.544 --> 23:36.816
she was really starting
to pull away from those girls.

23:36.849 --> 23:39.919
She was thinking about college.

23:39.952 --> 23:41.821
Meeting new people.

23:41.854 --> 23:45.024
She didn't really like Brittany.

23:45.057 --> 23:45.858
How do you know that?

23:45.892 --> 23:47.760
She could see how
nasty Brittany was,

23:47.794 --> 23:50.029
how manipulative.

23:50.062 --> 23:57.604
And... Emily sort of hooked up
with Brittany's boyfriend.

23:57.637 --> 23:59.639
Do you remember the boy's name?

24:01.841 --> 24:05.144
Lukas, I think.

24:05.177 --> 24:08.180
Brittany was so pissed off.

24:08.214 --> 24:13.052
She likes people to be afraid
of her, but...

24:13.085 --> 24:16.455
Emily wasn't afraid anymore.

24:18.925 --> 24:20.560
Lukas Croft.
Police, open up.

24:20.593 --> 24:21.561
What do you want?

24:21.594 --> 24:22.729
You know something?

24:22.762 --> 24:24.831
You gave us such
a great performance

24:24.864 --> 24:28.868
last time we talked,
we're looking for an encore.

24:28.901 --> 24:30.169
Sit down.

24:30.202 --> 24:31.938
Brittany O'Malley--
that ring a bell?

24:31.971 --> 24:33.105
She's 16.
That's statutory rape.

24:33.139 --> 24:35.141
Hey, can you act like
a prison inmate?

24:35.174 --> 24:36.175
We didn't have sex.

24:36.208 --> 24:37.176
Brittany wouldn't do it.

24:37.209 --> 24:38.745
You've got
about two seconds

24:38.778 --> 24:39.612
to tell us everything,

24:39.646 --> 24:40.980
or I make sure
you don't date again.

24:41.013 --> 24:41.914
Brittany and I started
going out

24:41.948 --> 24:44.751
last fall, and by the way,
she pursued me.

24:44.784 --> 24:46.218
Then a couple months ago,

24:46.252 --> 24:48.588
Brittany tells me
to hit on Emily.

24:48.621 --> 24:51.023
BENSON:
Right. She wanted
you to cheat.

24:51.057 --> 24:53.926
She said it was some
kind of friendship test.

24:53.960 --> 24:56.763
So I did,
and Emily was into it.

24:56.796 --> 24:58.197
What was I supposed
to do, say no?

24:58.230 --> 25:00.533
You're too much
of a stud for that. Bye-bye.

25:00.567 --> 25:01.968
Look, I'm sorry
I even did it.

25:02.001 --> 25:03.102
Brittany freaked out on me.

25:03.135 --> 25:05.037
She like psycho freaked out.
She's nuts.

25:05.071 --> 25:06.238
Okay, so why lie for her?

25:06.272 --> 25:07.840
I think she
poisoned Buttons.

25:07.874 --> 25:09.075
My cat.

25:09.108 --> 25:13.312
I can't prove it,
but I don't want
to cross that girl.

25:13.345 --> 25:14.313
She's crazy.

25:14.346 --> 25:16.115
I hadn't heard
from her in weeks,

25:16.148 --> 25:17.116
until that night.

25:17.149 --> 25:18.017
Said she was coming by
the set

25:18.050 --> 25:20.219
and I better have
a case of beer for her.

25:20.252 --> 25:21.253
Was Emily with her?

25:21.287 --> 25:23.890
They were in Emily's car,
but Emily wasn't there.

25:23.923 --> 25:26.726
When I tried to put
the beer in the trunk,
they freaked.

25:26.759 --> 25:28.661
You think that's where
they put Emily?

25:28.695 --> 25:29.461
Who are "they"?

25:29.495 --> 25:31.831
You know--
her two best friends,

25:31.864 --> 25:33.232
Andrea and Paige.

25:33.265 --> 25:36.168
They do whatever Brittany says.

25:36.202 --> 25:38.871
( cheerleaders chanting )

25:41.240 --> 25:42.074
Come on you can do it.

25:42.108 --> 25:44.310
Paige Summerbee,
you're under arrest

25:44.343 --> 25:46.178
for the murder
of Emily Sullivan.

25:46.212 --> 25:47.947
Brittany O'Malley
and Andrea Kent,

25:47.980 --> 25:49.081
step down please.

25:49.115 --> 25:50.082
Why?

25:50.116 --> 25:52.018
We can drag you out if you want.

25:56.856 --> 25:58.057
Brittany O'Malley,
Andrea Kent,

25:58.090 --> 26:00.927
you're under arrest
for the murder of
Emily Sullivan.

26:00.960 --> 26:02.729
You have the right
to remain silent.

26:02.762 --> 26:04.864
If you give up that right,
anything you say

26:04.897 --> 26:07.166
can and will be used
against you in a
court of law.

26:07.199 --> 26:09.001
You have the right
to an attorney.

26:09.035 --> 26:11.303
If you cannot afford one,
one will be appointed.

26:11.337 --> 26:13.205
Do you understand
these rights...?

26:17.944 --> 26:19.211
Where are the parents?

26:19.245 --> 26:20.179
Napa Valley.

26:20.212 --> 26:23.249
Mr. and Mrs. Kent are
on a plane as we speak.

26:23.282 --> 26:26.653
They've agreed to allow Andrea
to answer questions

26:26.686 --> 26:29.255
in my presence as a gesture
of cooperation.

26:29.288 --> 26:32.024
I hope you want
to cooperate too, Andrea.

26:32.058 --> 26:34.326
It will make things
a whole lot easier.

26:34.360 --> 26:35.862
I didn't kill Emily.

26:38.698 --> 26:39.531
Who did?

26:39.565 --> 26:42.735
I don't know.
I'm telling the truth.

26:42.769 --> 26:44.737
You told the detectives
you didn't see Emily

26:44.771 --> 26:46.072
the night she of her murder,

26:46.105 --> 26:47.674
but Lukas Croft saw you
in her car.

26:47.707 --> 26:51.277
So that was
a lie, wasn't it?

26:54.280 --> 26:56.148
I did go out with
Emily that night...

26:56.182 --> 26:58.985
but she wanted us to drop her
off at some bar,

26:59.018 --> 27:00.386
and then take her car home.

27:00.419 --> 27:02.722
The car where
her body was found?

27:02.755 --> 27:03.723
Yeah.

27:03.756 --> 27:04.724
We'd all been drinking,

27:04.757 --> 27:05.725
so we parked
the car

27:05.758 --> 27:06.926
and took the train.

27:06.959 --> 27:10.029
I called Emily and told her
where she could pick it up.

27:10.062 --> 27:11.798
Great. Then we can
check your cell

27:11.831 --> 27:13.165
to make sure that's true.

27:13.199 --> 27:14.400
I called from a pay phone.

27:14.433 --> 27:16.302
Okay. Then we can
check Emily's cell

27:16.335 --> 27:17.704
for the incoming call.

27:17.737 --> 27:20.840
Unless that's
not the truth either.

27:20.873 --> 27:23.175
Why are you being so mean to me?

27:23.209 --> 27:24.711
Because you're lying to me,
Paige,

27:24.744 --> 27:26.245
and you've been lying
about this all along.

27:26.278 --> 27:27.446
Quit hounding her.

27:27.479 --> 27:29.982
We're through if
you don't stop trying
to upset my client.

27:30.016 --> 27:31.283
Where was Brittany
this whole time?

27:31.317 --> 27:32.284
With us.

27:32.318 --> 27:34.453
If Brittany did
something wrong,

27:34.486 --> 27:37.023
you're not responsible
for that.

27:37.056 --> 27:38.290
You understand that?

27:38.324 --> 27:41.293
You can't control
what other people do.

27:41.327 --> 27:42.294
Go on, honey,

27:42.328 --> 27:44.330
tell him the truth.

27:44.363 --> 27:45.865
She didn't do anything.

27:45.898 --> 27:49.168
Right, and you know this
because you were with her

27:49.201 --> 27:50.402
the whole time,
right?

27:50.436 --> 27:52.872
She's answered the question,
Detective.

27:52.905 --> 27:55.174
Well, maybe she can answer
this question now.

27:55.207 --> 27:57.276
We found a blonde hair
in the duct tape used

27:57.309 --> 27:59.445
to bind Emily's arms
and legs.

27:59.478 --> 28:02.314
DNA says that hair belongs
to Brittany.

28:02.348 --> 28:04.717
Now, if you were
with her the whole night,

28:04.751 --> 28:08.320
you must have been
during that, too,
right, Paige?

28:08.354 --> 28:09.288
It was a joke.

28:09.321 --> 28:11.791
BENSON:
Tying somebody up
and throwing them

28:11.824 --> 28:13.259
into the back
of the trunk

28:13.292 --> 28:15.227
and then beating them
to death is a joke?

28:15.261 --> 28:16.228
We didn't hurt her.

28:16.262 --> 28:18.430
I mean, we just had her
in the trunk, that's it.

28:18.464 --> 28:20.466
I don't know how all
the other stuff happened.

28:20.499 --> 28:22.268
Do you expect me to believe
that you taped her up,

28:22.301 --> 28:23.803
but somebody else killed her?

28:23.836 --> 28:25.271
Yes.

28:25.304 --> 28:27.339
This is a dangerous city,
Detective.

28:27.373 --> 28:29.141
Look, all we were trying to do
is teach her a lesson.

28:29.175 --> 28:30.376
What lesson?

28:30.409 --> 28:32.244
That you can't just do whatever
you want.

28:32.278 --> 28:33.379
There are rules.

28:33.412 --> 28:35.347
What rules?

28:35.381 --> 28:36.749
You can't steal
somebody's boyfriend.

28:36.783 --> 28:39.385
So you guys just
drove around with Emily
in the trunk all night,

28:39.418 --> 28:42.955
and then what, left her there,
alive, perfectly fine?

28:42.989 --> 28:44.356
Ms. Novak, I think we're through

28:44.390 --> 28:45.792
answering questions
for a while.

28:45.825 --> 28:46.793
I just want
to make sure

28:46.826 --> 28:50.162
your client understands
the situation she's in.

28:50.196 --> 28:51.263
No one is going

28:51.297 --> 28:52.664
to believe
that, Andrea.

28:52.698 --> 28:55.401
This lie, you and your
little friends cooked up,
it's a bad one.

28:55.434 --> 28:57.236
So if you've got anything
you want to say to me

28:57.269 --> 28:59.772
before I walk out that door,
you better say it now.

29:01.307 --> 29:03.475
Brittany went crazy!

29:03.509 --> 29:05.144
She just lost it.

29:05.177 --> 29:08.247
It was awful,
she started punching Emily,

29:08.280 --> 29:10.850
and then she lit some cigarettes

29:10.883 --> 29:14.186
and she started burning her
her with them.

29:14.220 --> 29:16.823
She had these little scissors...

29:16.856 --> 29:19.425
And Brittany was
cutting her...

29:19.458 --> 29:23.863
and then she took out a knife
and started stabbing her,

29:23.896 --> 29:26.465
and there was so much blood.

29:26.498 --> 29:30.269
I didn't know what to do,
and...

29:30.302 --> 29:33.472
I never wanted to hurt Emily.

29:33.505 --> 29:36.876
What were you doing
during all of this?

29:36.909 --> 29:40.446
Me and Paige were just
standing there.

29:40.479 --> 29:42.514
We couldn't believe it.

29:42.548 --> 29:43.715
And you didn't
help Brittany?

29:43.749 --> 29:46.819
You didn't hold Emily down,
maybe take a few shots yourself?

29:46.853 --> 29:49.488
No. I swear.
Brittany did everything.

29:49.521 --> 29:51.390
No, they didn't do anything.

29:51.423 --> 29:54.360
CRAGEN:
I'm glad you're
saying that Brittany.

29:54.393 --> 29:56.495
Because it's consistent
with your friends' stories,

29:56.528 --> 29:58.965
that they're innocent
and you killed Emily
all by yourself.

29:58.998 --> 30:00.366
They're not saying that.

30:00.399 --> 30:03.002
You better believe they are,
little girl.

30:03.035 --> 30:06.205
Okay, I think that wraps it up
for today.

30:06.238 --> 30:08.240
No. What are they saying?

30:08.274 --> 30:11.110
That you killed Emily because
she stole your boyfriend.

30:11.143 --> 30:12.478
Oh, and that you're nuts.

30:12.511 --> 30:13.612
WOMAN:
They're clearly
lying.

30:13.645 --> 30:14.613
Shut up!

30:14.646 --> 30:15.614
You're not
helping!

30:15.647 --> 30:16.615
Brittany, sit down.

30:16.648 --> 30:17.950
No. Where are they?

30:17.984 --> 30:20.019
I want them to say this
to my face.

30:20.052 --> 30:22.088
Huh?! Bitches!
Say it to my face!

30:22.121 --> 30:23.155
That's enough.

30:31.463 --> 30:31.998
Buy you lunch, counselor?

30:33.365 --> 30:36.202
I'll even let you
talk me

30:36.235 --> 30:38.971
into a plea deal.

30:39.005 --> 30:39.805
In exchange, you get
my client's testimony.

30:39.838 --> 30:40.572
The sworn statement
of a murderer.

30:40.606 --> 30:42.374
That's tempting.

30:42.408 --> 30:43.876
No jury's going
to convict

30:43.910 --> 30:45.577
Andrea and Paige
without direct evidence.

30:45.611 --> 30:48.881
You'll need Brittany
to testify against them.

30:48.915 --> 30:49.748
Look, you've got

30:49.781 --> 30:52.051
two so-called
normal girls who sat back

30:52.084 --> 30:54.553
and allowed Emily Sullivan
to be murdered.

30:54.586 --> 30:56.889
My client's off her nut.

30:56.923 --> 30:58.624
What's their excuse?

30:58.657 --> 31:02.929
That's why they're being charged
for their crimes.

31:02.962 --> 31:05.998
You've got
a weak case at best.

31:06.032 --> 31:10.569
One sympathetic juror
will tank it.

31:13.539 --> 31:14.706
They're us, Casey--

31:14.740 --> 31:17.910
our sisters, our daughters,
our high school girlfriends.

31:17.944 --> 31:19.645
No one wants to believe.

31:19.678 --> 31:21.247
No. They're monsters.

31:21.280 --> 31:22.581
They're mean,
vicious little girls

31:22.614 --> 31:24.650
who think they can do
whatever they want.

31:24.683 --> 31:26.919
And up until now
they've gotten away with it.

31:26.953 --> 31:29.021
But not anymore. No deal.

31:30.289 --> 31:32.158
( knocking )

31:32.191 --> 31:36.295
Well, maybe these two will
change your mind.

31:36.328 --> 31:39.398
I'll be at my regular table.

31:39.431 --> 31:40.432
Motion to sever,
I assume.

31:40.466 --> 31:42.969
We're happy with
one trial for
both our clients.

31:43.002 --> 31:47.573
And since you can't prove
intent, it'll be a short trial.

31:49.075 --> 31:50.943
Andrea and Paige were part
of a group

31:50.977 --> 31:52.244
that was under the spell

31:52.278 --> 31:53.980
of Brittany O'Malley.

31:54.013 --> 31:55.948
They didn't have
the mental state
to form intent.

31:55.982 --> 31:56.782
I've seen this movie.

31:56.815 --> 31:58.684
It's the one about
the zombies, right?

31:58.717 --> 32:00.619
Actually, Ms. Novak,
you're not far off.

32:00.652 --> 32:03.389
If you're going with
an affirmative defense,

32:03.422 --> 32:05.524
Mr. Kressler, I've yet
to receive notification.

32:05.557 --> 32:07.259
We're not arguing
diminished capacity.

32:07.293 --> 32:08.294
This is about free will,

32:08.327 --> 32:11.030
and the People can't prove
that our clients had it.

32:11.063 --> 32:12.698
Well, what exactly did these
girls intend

32:12.731 --> 32:15.001
when they held Emily Sullivan
in a trunk of a car all night?

32:15.034 --> 32:16.102
They had no intent.

32:16.135 --> 32:17.703
They were under the control
of Brittany O'Malley,

32:17.736 --> 32:19.705
a charismatic,
anti-social leader.

32:19.738 --> 32:21.707
Your Honor,
the mob-mentality
defense was used

32:21.740 --> 32:23.675
in the Reginald Denny trial
after the L.A. riots,

32:23.709 --> 32:27.279
the civil rights trial after
the Crown Heights riots.

32:27.313 --> 32:28.347
Where is the mob?

32:28.380 --> 32:31.017
These were three teenaged girls.

32:31.050 --> 32:31.850
We have expert

32:31.883 --> 32:34.053
testimony that will
amply illustrate

32:34.086 --> 32:35.221
the profound effect

32:35.254 --> 32:37.723
that small groups have
on the individual.

32:37.756 --> 32:40.192
A defense like this is dangerous
because if the jury buys it,

32:40.226 --> 32:44.196
personal responsibility
goes out the window.

32:44.230 --> 32:46.565
That's a matter of opinion.

32:46.598 --> 32:52.404
This is a matter of fact
for the jury to decide.

32:52.438 --> 32:54.073
I'll allow it.

32:57.609 --> 32:58.577
Drop kidnapping,

32:58.610 --> 33:00.179
my client pleads guilty
to man one

33:00.212 --> 33:01.747
and testifies against
Barbie and Skipper.

33:01.780 --> 33:02.748
See? Reasonable.

33:02.781 --> 33:04.350
I don't know why I even bother.

33:04.383 --> 33:06.552
The jury's gonna take
one look at Andrea
and Paige

33:06.585 --> 33:07.553
and jump on any excuse

33:07.586 --> 33:08.754
not to throw them in jail.

33:08.787 --> 33:10.556
That's certainly
a possibility.

33:10.589 --> 33:13.725
It's also possible a jury will
send your client

33:13.759 --> 33:17.396
to prison
for the rest of her life.

33:17.429 --> 33:20.166
Murder two,

33:20.199 --> 33:20.999
kidnapping one,

33:21.033 --> 33:22.768
sentences to be served
concurrently

33:22.801 --> 33:25.237
with the possibility of parole.

33:25.271 --> 33:27.406
This is your client's
only chance at a future.

33:27.439 --> 33:28.774
She should take it
and thank me.

33:28.807 --> 33:30.676
So, I testify against Andrea
and Paige.

33:30.709 --> 33:32.044
You tell the truth
to the jury,

33:32.078 --> 33:36.048
or the deal's gone
and I add perjury.

33:36.082 --> 33:38.817
Oh, I'll tell them everything.

33:38.850 --> 33:41.019
I really don't care.

33:43.789 --> 33:46.392
BRITTANY:
Andrea told Emily that
we were going out all night.

33:46.425 --> 33:49.061
She made up the
sleepover so that

33:49.095 --> 33:51.363
Emily's parents
wouldn't be looking for her.

33:51.397 --> 33:53.799
Because Andrea didn't want
you guys getting caught.

33:53.832 --> 33:55.167
Objection.
Calls for speculation.

33:55.201 --> 33:56.168
JUDGE:
Sustained.

33:56.202 --> 33:57.803
Emily's arms and legs

33:57.836 --> 33:59.771
were bound with duct tape.

33:59.805 --> 34:01.107
She ever get loose?

34:01.140 --> 34:02.674
Oh, yeah, a couple times.

34:02.708 --> 34:04.643
She kicked me in the face once.

34:04.676 --> 34:06.345
What did the defendants
do when she freed herself?

34:06.378 --> 34:07.646
The first time,

34:07.679 --> 34:08.747
Paige grabbed
her by the hair

34:08.780 --> 34:10.082
so I could fix the tape.

34:10.116 --> 34:11.350
And then when
she kicked me,

34:11.383 --> 34:13.219
she almost got out of the trunk,

34:13.252 --> 34:15.187
and then Andrea pushed
her back in.

34:15.221 --> 34:18.090
Were the defendants ever left
alone with the victim?

34:18.124 --> 34:20.126
Oh, yeah, for five
or ten minutes

34:20.159 --> 34:21.793
when I went
to go buy cigarettes.

34:21.827 --> 34:26.265
NOVAK:
When it was over
when Emily was dead,

34:26.298 --> 34:30.102
what did you guys do?

34:30.136 --> 34:31.137
Paige was hungry,

34:31.170 --> 34:32.871
so we went to go get waffles.

34:32.904 --> 34:35.441
And then we just took
the train home.

34:35.474 --> 34:38.844
Did Andrea or Paige,
at any point

34:38.877 --> 34:42.814
during that night,
ask you to stop?

34:42.848 --> 34:48.187
No. They were having fun.

34:49.588 --> 34:51.190
Nothing further.

34:51.223 --> 34:54.726
Your witness.

34:54.760 --> 34:58.864
So you say Andrea and Paige
never asked you to stop.

34:58.897 --> 35:01.800
Let me ask you this--
did Emily?

35:01.833 --> 35:03.469
I guess.

35:03.502 --> 35:05.404
You guess?

35:05.437 --> 35:07.473
Didn't she beg you to stop.

35:07.506 --> 35:09.575
Didn't she offer you money,
her diamond earrings,

35:09.608 --> 35:10.842
anything you wanted?

35:10.876 --> 35:11.910
Yes.

35:11.943 --> 35:14.313
Didn't she cry out
for her mother?

35:14.346 --> 35:17.449
And you thought
that was funny.

35:17.483 --> 35:19.285
Yes.

35:21.787 --> 35:25.357
Who was it that cut Emily skin
with scissors

35:25.391 --> 35:26.758
over a hundred times?

35:26.792 --> 35:29.261
I did.

35:29.295 --> 35:30.196
And who brought a knife,

35:30.229 --> 35:31.730
then later used it
to cut Emily's throat?

35:31.763 --> 35:32.564
Me.

35:32.598 --> 35:34.733
And the cigarettes
you went out to buy,

35:34.766 --> 35:36.835
you used those
to burn Emily's skin, right?

35:36.868 --> 35:38.737
Right.

35:38.770 --> 35:40.739
So the truth is,

35:40.772 --> 35:42.474
you didn't want Andrea and Paige
to help you torture

35:42.508 --> 35:43.542
and kill Emily.

35:43.575 --> 35:44.510
You just wanted an audience.

35:44.543 --> 35:45.877
Objection.

35:45.911 --> 35:48.914
Withdrawn.

35:48.947 --> 35:50.316
Nothing further.

35:52.551 --> 35:54.953
Dr. Sopher, in your study

35:54.986 --> 35:58.424
of neurology of behavior,
you also studied

35:58.457 --> 36:01.827
how environment influences
behavior, right?

36:01.860 --> 36:02.861
Of course.

36:02.894 --> 36:04.796
And when an
environment
consists

36:04.830 --> 36:05.764
of a small group

36:05.797 --> 36:09.201
influencing an individual,
what is that called?

36:09.235 --> 36:10.902
Small group dynamics:

36:10.936 --> 36:14.573
an individual's identity
fuses with the group.

36:14.606 --> 36:17.209
You see it with soldiers
or cult members.

36:17.243 --> 36:18.210
How does it happen?

36:18.244 --> 36:22.381
Intense situations
create intense solidarity.

36:22.414 --> 36:24.950
Adolescents are arguably
under years of stress--

36:24.983 --> 36:27.653
physiologically,
emotionally, hormonally.

36:27.686 --> 36:32.224
Solidarity makes the urge
to conform irresistible.

36:32.258 --> 36:34.293
And you think this
explains two girls

36:34.326 --> 36:39.498
watching and even participating
in the murder of another?

36:39.531 --> 36:42.401
The urge to conform
explains far more
heinous acts.

36:42.434 --> 36:45.237
Look at Nazi Germany,
Rwanda.

36:45.271 --> 36:47.273
Thank you, Dr. Sopher.

36:47.306 --> 36:49.241
Your witness.

36:49.275 --> 36:50.609
Wow. To hear you talk,

36:50.642 --> 36:53.545
we'd expect to see packs
of teenaged girls

36:53.579 --> 36:55.981
roaming the streets
killing people.

36:56.014 --> 36:58.250
No. The group was under
the influence of one girl

36:58.284 --> 37:00.018
intent on murder.

37:00.051 --> 37:01.720
So you're saying
it's impossible

37:01.753 --> 37:04.323
for a teenager
to have free will in a group?

37:04.356 --> 37:05.457
If she has
a strong will,

37:05.491 --> 37:06.925
she can withstand
the desire to conform.

37:06.958 --> 37:08.827
Then the defendants
are just weak.

37:08.860 --> 37:12.998
That's perhaps
a simple explanation.

37:13.031 --> 37:14.466
Well, last time I checked,

37:14.500 --> 37:16.635
being weak isn't an excuse
for murder.

37:16.668 --> 37:18.537
It's just pathetic.

37:18.570 --> 37:19.571
Objection.
Argumentative.

37:19.605 --> 37:22.007
Sustained.

37:22.040 --> 37:23.275
Nothing further.

37:23.309 --> 37:25.811
I feel so bad
about everything.

37:25.844 --> 37:28.414
I haven't been able to sleep.

37:28.447 --> 37:30.916
Brittany said you planned
a lot of it, Andrea.

37:30.949 --> 37:33.652
You got Emily
to leave her
house that night.

37:33.685 --> 37:35.854
I thought that we were
just going to talk to her

37:35.887 --> 37:39.491
about how she wasn't being
a good friend.

37:39.525 --> 37:42.694
The only reason I set it up
was because it was my birthday.

37:42.728 --> 37:45.297
I told her we were going out
to celebrate.

37:45.331 --> 37:47.433
So you never suspected

37:47.466 --> 37:50.436
that Brittany wanted
to kill Emily?

37:50.469 --> 37:51.603
No way.

37:51.637 --> 37:52.904
I wouldn't have gone.

37:52.938 --> 37:54.440
Why didn't you stop her?

37:54.473 --> 37:55.441
I couldn't.

37:55.474 --> 37:57.709
You don't say no to Brittany.

37:57.743 --> 37:59.911
You have to go along with her.

37:59.945 --> 38:01.780
I'm so sorry.

38:06.017 --> 38:07.319
You feel bad now

38:07.353 --> 38:10.422
for everything
that happened to Emily.

38:10.456 --> 38:11.657
Yes.

38:11.690 --> 38:14.393
When I got home
that morning,
I threw up.

38:14.426 --> 38:16.362
But I was afraid.

38:16.395 --> 38:17.396
Of getting caught?

38:17.429 --> 38:19.097
Of Brittany?

38:19.130 --> 38:20.231
No.

38:20.265 --> 38:24.102
I was afraid if I told,
Brittany wouldn't be my friend.

38:24.135 --> 38:25.103
You said your

38:25.136 --> 38:26.805
cover story was going out

38:26.838 --> 38:28.440
to celebrate your birthday.

38:28.474 --> 38:29.274
January.

38:29.307 --> 38:31.377
That makes you a Capricorn,
right?

38:31.410 --> 38:33.379
Yeah.

38:33.412 --> 38:34.713
What's your birthstone?

38:34.746 --> 38:35.414
Objection. Relevance?

38:35.447 --> 38:36.615
I'm getting to it,
Your Honor.

38:36.648 --> 38:37.483
Hurry it up, Ms. Novak.

38:37.516 --> 38:39.418
The witness will answer
the question.

38:41.887 --> 38:43.455
My birthstone's garnet.

38:43.489 --> 38:45.391
That's what I thought.

38:45.424 --> 38:47.058
I see you're wearing
your class ring.

38:47.092 --> 38:51.897
That's my birthstone--
sapphire.

38:51.930 --> 38:53.031
September birthday.

38:53.064 --> 38:56.001
You know who else who had
a September birthday, Andrea?

38:56.034 --> 38:57.002
Objection!

38:57.035 --> 38:58.003
Relevance?

38:58.036 --> 38:58.937
Overruled.

38:58.970 --> 39:01.907
Didn't Emily have
a September birthday?

39:01.940 --> 39:02.908
I don't know.

39:02.941 --> 39:04.910
Emily had a class ring.

39:04.943 --> 39:06.612
It was engraved with her name.

39:06.645 --> 39:08.447
It was never found
with her body.

39:08.480 --> 39:09.981
Your Honor, would you instruct
the defendant

39:10.015 --> 39:11.517
to remove her ring?

39:11.550 --> 39:13.552
Hand it to me, Ms. Kent.

39:15.721 --> 39:17.523
Paige gave it to me.

39:17.556 --> 39:19.157
She took it off of Emily
after she was dead!

39:19.190 --> 39:22.060
You're a liar!
You took her Prada purse!

39:22.093 --> 39:24.863
Sidebar, Your Honor.
She's got
Emily's clothes, too.

39:24.896 --> 39:26.798
The ones with all
the blood on them.

39:26.832 --> 39:28.600
If you felt so bad
about what happened,

39:28.634 --> 39:29.935
then why are you wearing
a dead girl's ring?

39:29.968 --> 39:30.969
Your Honor!

39:31.002 --> 39:33.505
JUDGE:
Enough! Counsel, approach.

39:38.910 --> 39:39.878
Move for a mistrial, Your Honor.

39:39.911 --> 39:40.979
The defendant perjured herself.

39:41.012 --> 39:41.980
Prove it.

39:42.013 --> 39:43.148
May we have time
to confer?

39:43.181 --> 39:44.015
You may not,

39:44.049 --> 39:46.017
and your motion's denied,
Ms. Riff.

39:46.051 --> 39:46.918
You'll have an opportunity

39:46.952 --> 39:48.987
to impeach her statements
in redirect.

39:49.020 --> 39:52.858
Please continue, Ms. Novak.

39:52.891 --> 39:54.560
No further questions.

40:02.200 --> 40:04.903
Guilty on all counts.

40:04.936 --> 40:06.972
It's a 15-minute jury verdict.

40:07.005 --> 40:07.939
( phone rings )

40:07.973 --> 40:09.374
That's very impressive,
Counselor.
Yeah.

40:09.407 --> 40:12.911
Remind me to give you
the names of all the girls
I hated in high school.

40:12.944 --> 40:15.013
Takes you back,
doesn't it?

40:15.046 --> 40:17.883
I hated it
the first time around.

40:17.916 --> 40:18.884
Olivia, Westchester PD.

40:18.917 --> 40:20.919
Shots fired
at Tanner Day.

40:39.004 --> 40:41.807
The school wouldn't remove it
until they documented it.

40:41.840 --> 40:43.975
It's been up all day.

40:53.118 --> 40:54.920
STABLER:
Who is she?

40:54.953 --> 40:56.488
BENSON:
I don't know.

40:56.522 --> 40:58.524
She's a senior,
real popular.

40:58.557 --> 40:59.791
Eh, it's a shame.

40:59.825 --> 41:02.227
OFFICER:
You have the right
to have an attorney

41:02.260 --> 41:04.029
present now and
in the future.

41:04.062 --> 41:05.831
If you cannot afford
an attorney,

41:05.864 --> 41:09.100
one will be appointed
to you by the court.

41:09.134 --> 41:11.269
Do you understand
these rights as
I've read them to you?

41:11.302 --> 41:13.238
Agnes, what happened?

41:13.271 --> 41:17.108
They went to jail

41:17.142 --> 41:22.047
and it didn't even make
any difference.

41:22.080 --> 41:24.950
It was never gonna stop.

41:24.983 --> 41:29.087
No matter what anybody did,
it was never gonna stop.
