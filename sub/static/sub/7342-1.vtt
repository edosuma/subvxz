02:57.687 --> 02:59.270
Neeli...

03:00.673 --> 03:04.729
Neeli, open your eyes and look at me.

03:10.200 --> 03:13.770
Grief ages even a creature like me.

03:16.354 --> 03:18.520
Tell me...

03:19.395 --> 03:21.395
What am I?

03:22.437 --> 03:24.354
Who am I?

03:28.395 --> 03:31.604
What curse
have I brought down upon myself?

03:40.645 --> 03:41.979
Neeli...

03:44.645 --> 03:48.770
How many times
must I tell you this tale again?

03:54.270 --> 03:56.312
Neeli...

04:09.576 --> 04:12.104
A long time ago,
this was my home.

04:36.520 --> 04:39.895
And once, this was my country.

05:19.306 --> 05:21.562
Did we beat them back, Umber?

05:22.812 --> 05:25.895
Yes, but they'll be back.

05:27.312 --> 05:28.951
Well done!

05:30.046 --> 05:32.104
You killed one of them.

05:34.823 --> 05:37.823
Why are you bringing this dead Muslim
into our village?

05:38.355 --> 05:40.531
What are you doing, my son?

05:41.531 --> 05:44.823
Don't do it.
Don't poison our waters.

05:45.614 --> 05:48.031
You'll bring down a curse on our village.

05:48.274 --> 05:50.489
It's not our village anymore.

05:50.855 --> 05:53.906
I'll leave them their own ghosts
to haunt them.

05:54.909 --> 05:59.323
A true Sikh would never do this.
- We are nothing now.

06:01.733 --> 06:04.073
Shall we get the women
back to the village?

06:04.882 --> 06:07.198
It'll be safer in the morning.

06:16.239 --> 06:17.864
Congratulations!

06:33.695 --> 06:36.403
Here Mehar, take your daughter.

06:44.278 --> 06:47.111
A daughter is also a blessing.

06:59.153 --> 07:03.736
It's safe now!
The women can return to the village!

07:05.570 --> 07:09.195
We can go back!
It's safe to go back to the village now!

07:14.795 --> 07:17.586
Will you be all right?
- Yes. You go.

07:19.441 --> 07:22.795
Tell my husband I'm here.
-Yes, I'll tell Umber.

07:41.086 --> 07:44.157
Mehar! Mehar!

07:48.086 --> 07:50.253
She's still back there.

08:01.832 --> 08:03.586
Papaji!

08:05.062 --> 08:07.427
Papaji!

08:28.590 --> 08:30.420
Don't you want to see your daughter?

08:36.508 --> 08:39.753
I've seen enough girls.

08:43.306 --> 08:45.128
I'll get the cart for you.

08:54.888 --> 08:56.753
Take care of yourself.

09:00.928 --> 09:03.461
We managed
to hold off their attack last night.

09:08.235 --> 09:11.069
But how long can we survive?

09:12.444 --> 09:14.277
What will we do now?

09:17.527 --> 09:22.277
The elders say the whole village
has to leave by this evening.

09:23.793 --> 09:26.194
Are you ready to leave?

09:28.402 --> 09:30.944
By evening we'll have to leave.

09:48.027 --> 09:51.485
Listen, we cannot take much with us.

09:53.819 --> 09:56.110
Are you sure you want to take me?

09:58.652 --> 10:00.569
You are my wife.

10:33.319 --> 10:34.569
Leave it open.

10:34.735 --> 10:37.444
I don't want them
to break into our house.

10:40.183 --> 10:44.332
You take care of the children.
I'll be back. Go!

11:50.549 --> 11:54.194
Now, poison your own people.

13:40.495 --> 13:44.078
The Partition had scattered us
like birds in a storm.

13:49.828 --> 13:54.078
It took me four years
to get back on my feet.

14:02.953 --> 14:07.036
They've brought you what they looted
from those who fled to Pakistan.

14:09.875 --> 14:11.578
Have a look...

14:35.286 --> 14:38.036
These will look good in your new home!

15:27.221 --> 15:29.286
Papaji, is this for me?

15:29.453 --> 15:34.620
Tomorrow we'll go to the jeweller
and get earrings for all of you.

15:37.585 --> 15:40.328
We'll soon get back all your gold
that went into this house.

15:40.585 --> 15:44.245
The house still needs a lot of work.
We'll worry about the gold later.

15:44.477 --> 15:46.536
Let me worry about that.

15:50.720 --> 15:53.370
What do you want to do
with your parents' house?

15:53.640 --> 15:56.703
You are never going to go there.
It's so far away.

15:57.977 --> 16:00.203
You know Uncle Keerath wants it.

16:00.370 --> 16:02.261
He'll never pay what it's worth.

16:07.936 --> 16:10.745
I'd love
to take the children there one day.

16:11.161 --> 16:16.370
Show them
what their mother's home was like!

16:18.504 --> 16:21.123
It could help us
with the girls' dowry later.

16:21.355 --> 16:25.828
Oh, their younger brother is on his way.
He will take care of that.

16:27.061 --> 16:29.603
I'm not going back to the forest.

16:31.353 --> 16:34.103
Until he is born
I will stay here with you.

16:37.603 --> 16:40.019
It will be a girl again.

16:49.353 --> 16:51.811
You'll see, this time it will be a boy.

17:04.519 --> 17:06.394
Why have you come in?

17:08.654 --> 17:12.810
You'll kill me if it isn't a boy?

17:14.749 --> 17:17.353
Once more like a true lioness!

17:17.857 --> 17:21.519
Be brave like a true Sikh!
You've already had three children!

17:22.086 --> 17:25.478
She doesn't want to come into this world.

17:33.680 --> 17:36.353
With more force.

17:37.126 --> 17:38.811
Good.

17:39.139 --> 17:40.478
Good.

17:40.977 --> 17:42.356
Good.

17:42.436 --> 17:43.815
Good.

17:43.895 --> 17:45.329
Good.

17:45.409 --> 17:48.853
Oh! Very good!
Congratulations!

18:03.811 --> 18:05.811
Look, Mehar!

18:05.891 --> 18:08.144
A son's come to our home!

18:08.853 --> 18:11.436
You've had a boy!

18:15.436 --> 18:17.936
Here, look!

18:20.811 --> 18:22.269
Look!

18:25.311 --> 18:28.019
After three daughters, we've had a son.

18:31.603 --> 18:34.394
What are you doing?
You need to rest.

18:35.926 --> 18:36.998
You need to rest.

18:39.455 --> 18:41.136
Don't do this.

18:41.216 --> 18:42.811
It's better to kill her.

18:42.978 --> 18:44.728
What are you saying?

18:45.269 --> 18:46.936
We finally have a son.

18:49.019 --> 18:51.764
She's so beautiful.

18:52.539 --> 18:54.561
My son!

18:57.811 --> 18:59.894
My son!

19:39.369 --> 19:40.986
Kanwar, come down!

19:42.164 --> 19:43.486
Come down.

19:44.510 --> 19:46.444
Come and bathe!

19:48.537 --> 19:50.069
Papaji!

19:50.446 --> 19:52.194
Come, come!

19:53.795 --> 19:55.444
My moon!

20:31.865 --> 20:33.236
Papaji!

20:46.429 --> 20:48.194
Pull it up!

21:00.403 --> 21:01.819
Pull.

21:09.849 --> 21:13.156
Give it back!
Give me back my spool!

21:15.183 --> 21:16.659
Pull.

21:17.303 --> 21:18.448
Papaji!

21:18.866 --> 21:20.310
Hold this...
- Papaji!

21:21.164 --> 21:24.084
Kulbir and Sohni!
They ran off with my kite-spool!

21:24.326 --> 21:26.388
I don't ever want to see you
crying like a girl!

21:26.468 --> 21:29.308
Be a man and get it back!

21:30.830 --> 21:31.695
Go!

24:00.102 --> 24:06.144
Tall as a tree and still peeing in bed!

24:06.935 --> 24:10.602
All of you old enough to be married
and have your own children!

24:11.852 --> 24:14.477
Will you be doing the same
at your in-laws?

24:15.297 --> 24:17.269
You'll bring nothing but shame on us!

24:17.532 --> 24:19.602
Worthless girls!

24:21.745 --> 24:23.336
Straighten it!

24:23.416 --> 24:25.100
Mother, mother.
- Yes.

24:25.477 --> 24:27.269
Shall we go?
- Get going!

24:27.727 --> 24:28.769
Let's go

24:29.439 --> 24:32.685
We'll sing Lohri

24:32.947 --> 24:40.378
Today is our day
And every home waits for us.

24:44.612 --> 24:46.519
We'll get sweets and money!

25:07.963 --> 25:11.227
Kulbir look!
-That's Kanwar.

25:11.837 --> 25:13.519
How did he get here?

25:13.726 --> 25:15.034
Brother Kanwar?

25:15.380 --> 25:18.227
Kanwar!
How did you get here?

25:19.352 --> 25:20.644
Come down!

25:22.218 --> 25:23.477
Come down.

25:25.602 --> 25:26.810
Let's go!

25:28.796 --> 25:30.519
You're such a rat!

25:33.674 --> 25:35.019
Hurry up!

25:39.147 --> 25:41.060
You always get us in trouble.

25:42.080 --> 25:45.435
Tell me, why did you pee on my bed?

25:45.892 --> 25:49.477
Why did you steal my spool?
- What's so special about you?

25:50.147 --> 25:52.227
Let me see!
- Let me go!

25:52.541 --> 25:53.852
Let me see!
-I want to see.

25:57.938 --> 25:59.003
Kanwar!

26:35.743 --> 26:38.019
He'll be fine. Don't worry.

26:38.593 --> 26:39.611
Bye.

26:59.496 --> 27:02.435
Kulbir, come here.
Come here!

27:04.229 --> 27:05.080
Come here!

27:06.824 --> 27:07.578
Come here!

27:10.428 --> 27:11.210
Come here!

27:11.514 --> 27:12.808
Get up!

27:21.041 --> 27:22.667
Mother.
- Mother.

27:23.144 --> 27:25.144
Come here.
Come here.

27:37.721 --> 27:38.440
Come here!

27:38.520 --> 27:39.374
Mother.

27:39.454 --> 27:40.343
Come here!

27:41.249 --> 27:42.322
Come here!

27:43.353 --> 27:45.352
Mehar! Stop!

27:45.691 --> 27:46.894
Stay out of this!

27:47.774 --> 27:49.269
Leave! Get out!

28:01.134 --> 28:03.306
If anything happens to my son,

28:03.386 --> 28:05.469
I'll cut them to pieces!

28:40.025 --> 28:41.858
Greetings, child!

28:42.066 --> 28:44.775
Our village's champion wrestler.

28:45.157 --> 28:49.775
He's going to make you strong as iron.
- Hello, Sir.

28:52.775 --> 28:53.858
God bless you, son.

28:57.211 --> 28:58.525
Turn this way

28:59.983 --> 29:03.441
Let him take a look
just to check there are no twisted bones.

29:07.358 --> 29:09.316
After your turban ceremony,

29:09.483 --> 29:11.525
I'll take you hunting.

29:11.691 --> 29:12.816
Hunting?

29:12.983 --> 29:16.816
We're going to shoot bears.

29:20.566 --> 29:22.525
Look what I've got for you.

29:24.025 --> 29:25.441
Hold it.

29:27.525 --> 29:28.941
He's fine.

29:30.691 --> 29:33.983
I'm going to make you
as strong as a lion.

29:35.233 --> 29:37.775
What a brave boy my son has become!

29:40.500 --> 29:42.125
I'm so proud of you.

30:00.375 --> 30:01.916
Come here.

30:06.958 --> 30:08.375
Pull this up.

30:30.832 --> 30:34.125
Always keep this cloth tightly tied.

30:41.849 --> 30:43.500
Never forget it.

30:49.048 --> 30:50.958
Once again.

31:52.468 --> 31:53.809
Papaji!

31:55.474 --> 31:56.749
Papaji!

31:57.538 --> 31:58.705
Yes, son?

31:59.755 --> 32:00.750
Blood.

32:01.474 --> 32:02.621
Blood?

32:05.288 --> 32:07.455
Did you hurt yourself when you fell?

32:17.038 --> 32:18.746
How old are you now?

32:19.663 --> 32:20.830
Twelve.

32:26.890 --> 32:29.288
You've grown so quickly, my son.

32:33.095 --> 32:34.788
So quickly you've grown.

32:39.171 --> 32:42.080
Now you've become a real man.
Don't worry.

32:46.955 --> 32:49.038
Kanwar,

32:49.496 --> 32:54.996
don't tell your mother about it.

33:28.913 --> 33:35.009
The room of mangoes, O Mother!

33:35.388 --> 33:42.393
Bring the child to the room of mangoes!

33:42.739 --> 33:48.955
All pain will be assuaged, O Mother!

33:49.301 --> 33:56.075
Teach your son to walk like a fragrance!

33:56.155 --> 34:00.134
Your son!

34:03.236 --> 34:09.841
Teach him to walk like a fragrance!

34:10.696 --> 34:16.966
The room of mangoes, O Mother!

34:17.181 --> 34:24.338
Bring the child to the room of mangoes!

34:39.228 --> 34:46.915
I walk the path of clouds

34:47.574 --> 34:54.364
A son is born into my home! O, I fly!

34:54.667 --> 34:57.330
A son in my home!

34:57.607 --> 35:02.926
A moon glimmers in my home!

35:03.121 --> 35:05.288
My son, my moon!

35:05.563 --> 35:10.788
I fly! I fly!

35:11.239 --> 35:19.973
A boy has come to my home, I fly!

35:50.231 --> 35:51.538
Kanwar!

36:57.845 --> 36:59.988
Neeli, wait!
-No, I have to go.

37:00.612 --> 37:02.353
Neeli!

37:12.007 --> 37:14.007
Your favourite dessert tonight!

38:04.707 --> 38:08.655
I've been singing for you
since you were born.

38:08.958 --> 38:11.915
I also sang at your turban ceremony.

38:24.147 --> 38:27.152
Neeli, look!

39:16.106 --> 39:18.939
What have you found to rob?

39:23.932 --> 39:28.064
Your own people will kill you!
- You think I've come to rob your palace?

39:30.667 --> 39:32.213
Let's see.

39:43.174 --> 39:46.189
What a great hunter!
Show it to me.

39:47.920 --> 39:51.564
The daughter of a gypsy
has come to whore herself?

40:51.810 --> 40:55.183
Don't even try.
You'll never be able to catch me.

40:55.464 --> 40:57.314
Run and we'll see.

41:00.482 --> 41:02.273
Do you always talk like this?

41:02.607 --> 41:05.648
Like what?
- Like you smell shit all around you.

41:05.854 --> 41:07.940
I wanted to say sorry for slapping you.

41:08.806 --> 41:11.519
Now, I feel like slapping you again.

41:12.892 --> 41:14.648
So ask me to forgive you.

41:24.773 --> 41:29.033
Have you ever sat in a truck before?
Or are you just a know-all?

41:29.260 --> 41:31.482
Yes, many times.

41:32.320 --> 41:33.509
Fine.

41:33.888 --> 41:36.677
But I always sat in the back.
Never in the front!

41:41.368 --> 41:42.607
Come on.

41:43.141 --> 41:44.815
Today you sit in the front.

42:04.893 --> 42:06.565
I also want to drive a truck.

42:07.476 --> 42:08.773
Will you teach me?

42:09.293 --> 42:10.440
No.

42:37.956 --> 42:39.598
Have you ever gone hunting?

42:40.118 --> 42:41.682
When do girls ever go hunting?

42:41.967 --> 42:43.807
What nonsense you talk!

42:45.058 --> 42:47.523
My father killed a deer once.

42:48.085 --> 42:50.598
And the whole village feasted on it!

42:53.199 --> 42:54.890
I've killed bears.

42:57.113 --> 42:59.140
The first time I was so scared.

42:59.934 --> 43:02.506
It was father who had to shoot the bear.

43:04.550 --> 43:06.598
He was very upset with me.

43:07.944 --> 43:10.848
But my second bear
I killed with one shot.

43:13.274 --> 43:17.473
One night, it came to my cabin door.

43:19.911 --> 43:23.554
And kept scratching
my door with its claws.

43:33.262 --> 43:35.515
It made no other sound.

43:45.348 --> 43:48.140
I stood here with my rifle.

43:50.105 --> 43:51.682
Then I heard something.

43:52.494 --> 43:54.098
It felt like the bear was going away.

43:56.268 --> 43:57.557
I opened the door.

43:59.109 --> 44:01.067
But there it was.

44:03.251 --> 44:05.775
It jumped up on its two feet

44:06.192 --> 44:07.859
and rushed at me.

44:08.440 --> 44:11.192
I shot into the dark of its mouth.

44:16.181 --> 44:17.859
Are you afraid of the dark?

44:19.619 --> 44:21.025
Not at all.

44:30.409 --> 44:32.400
Let's see, my brave one...

44:40.567 --> 44:43.620
I am off, then.

44:44.859 --> 44:46.567
Stay and cry here all night.

44:49.025 --> 44:50.400
I'm going.

45:24.692 --> 45:26.150
What's happening there?

45:26.317 --> 45:29.317
A gypsy girl has been missing
since last night.

45:29.662 --> 45:31.734
I'll send some of my men into the forest.

45:32.138 --> 45:34.150
You come with me.

45:35.316 --> 45:36.525
Don't worry.

45:36.830 --> 45:39.275
I'm with you.
We'll find your daughter.

45:56.861 --> 45:58.483
I hope the night wasn't too scary.

46:02.064 --> 46:04.540
If you misbehave again,

46:05.426 --> 46:08.517
I'll leave you locked up here forever.

46:09.048 --> 46:10.309
Now, get lost!

46:11.686 --> 46:12.767
I told you to go.

46:13.221 --> 46:15.225
Your father is searching for you.

46:16.171 --> 46:17.600
Come, let's go.

46:21.707 --> 46:24.809
You have to marry me now.
- What?

46:25.836 --> 46:27.225
You have to marry me now.

46:27.858 --> 46:29.620
Or my family will kill me.

46:30.334 --> 46:31.475
And you, too.

46:34.052 --> 46:36.517
It's the only way
they can redeem their honour.

46:38.939 --> 46:40.184
I didn't do anything.

46:40.852 --> 46:42.517
They won't believe that.

46:42.960 --> 46:45.392
You tell them.

46:46.355 --> 46:48.475
They won't believe me.
-Look...

46:50.873 --> 46:52.895
My father will fix everything.

46:53.598 --> 46:57.847
If this had happened to your sisters,
what would your Papaji do then?

47:13.771 --> 47:16.100
I was born under an inauspicious star.

47:18.213 --> 47:20.684
It's not my destiny to marry.

47:22.203 --> 47:26.192
A wife like me
could change your destiny.

47:33.802 --> 47:36.934
That really scared you, didn't it?

47:43.309 --> 47:46.934
So you think you scared me?
-Of course, I did!

47:54.029 --> 47:57.582
Let go of me!
You dog! You bully!

47:57.662 --> 47:59.359
Get off me!

48:05.272 --> 48:08.396
Let go of me!
You dog! You bully!

48:08.476 --> 48:10.494
Get off me!

48:11.046 --> 48:15.219
Get off me!

48:16.732 --> 48:17.934
Kanwar!

48:26.076 --> 48:29.951
Tarlok, wait! Please wait.

48:41.368 --> 48:45.326
I request
your daughter's hand for my son.

48:46.368 --> 48:47.826
My daughter?

48:50.326 --> 48:52.784
My Neeli?
-Yes.

48:54.473 --> 48:57.534
You are a great, honourable man.

48:58.993 --> 49:01.409
Oh, we are relatives now!

49:19.888 --> 49:22.034
My son has become a man.

49:27.229 --> 49:28.743
A man?

49:32.776 --> 49:34.494
Papaji!

49:45.455 --> 49:47.159
My brave son!

49:55.118 --> 49:56.951
Serve some milk to Kanwar.

49:58.618 --> 50:00.993
Child, you come with me.

50:14.666 --> 50:16.363
Eat!

50:28.957 --> 50:30.951
Why don't you dance?

50:31.943 --> 50:34.401
You should have told me the truth
before the wedding.

50:34.949 --> 50:37.276
Now you're the queen of this mansion.

50:40.052 --> 50:43.276
Whatever you want you will get.
Clothes, jewellery...

50:44.539 --> 50:46.818
Everything in this house is yours.

50:57.252 --> 51:00.647
We have no tradition of the veil
in this house.

51:01.651 --> 51:04.222
You should have kept the tradition
for your son.

51:04.302 --> 51:07.276
You... shut up!

51:08.053 --> 51:09.526
What are you saying?

51:14.593 --> 51:16.151
Take off your veil.

51:19.047 --> 51:20.852
Do you hear me?

51:35.209 --> 51:37.151
You don't look stupid to me.

51:38.322 --> 51:41.652
I told you, Kanwar had an accident
when he was a boy.

51:43.036 --> 51:45.458
Nothing can be done about it now.

51:53.058 --> 51:54.496
Mehar.

52:02.258 --> 52:03.776
You speak to her.

52:09.901 --> 52:13.524
Let me go back to my home.
- Don't say that.

52:18.043 --> 52:20.776
You think any married woman
can live like this?

52:24.659 --> 52:26.651
Can you not live here as my daughter?

54:29.305 --> 54:30.513
Mehar...

54:34.083 --> 54:37.472
This girl will do
whatever we ask her to do.

54:37.910 --> 54:40.888
She'll accept everything as her destiny.

54:47.748 --> 54:49.180
And Kanwar?

54:50.234 --> 54:52.097
Tell me about his destiny.

55:53.297 --> 55:55.088
How's this one?

55:55.255 --> 55:56.672
Beautiful?

56:03.384 --> 56:04.755
Look at this one.

56:06.012 --> 56:08.228
How does this look?
- Very beautiful.

56:08.387 --> 56:09.868
Very beautiful, isn't it?

56:11.738 --> 56:13.155
Let's buy this one.

56:17.760 --> 56:20.447
Are you happy?

56:21.655 --> 56:24.679
When you have a son,
I'll buy you the whole shop.

56:37.863 --> 56:40.030
And how's our new bride?

56:42.113 --> 56:48.197
You know,
I was uprooted from my country and home.

56:49.655 --> 56:54.655
All the dreams of my ancestors
turned to ash.

57:00.697 --> 57:03.280
It is only a wife...

57:06.197 --> 57:10.322
who can give you that which
no one can ever take away from you.

57:14.780 --> 57:17.322
Everything comes to an end.

57:20.530 --> 57:22.197
Nothing lasts.

57:35.273 --> 57:38.155
If you manage to stay happy,

57:40.431 --> 57:42.441
Kanwar will be happy too.

57:52.658 --> 57:56.197
Without your mother,
you would never have been mine.

57:58.279 --> 58:02.738
By giving you to me, your mother
rooted me to this earth again.

58:09.706 --> 58:15.780
And who could be a better son
to any father than you.

58:33.477 --> 58:35.155
Come and eat.

01:00:49.975 --> 01:00:51.280
Neeli?

01:01:12.603 --> 01:01:15.046
Where are you going?

01:01:18.054 --> 01:01:22.563
You are a part of my family.
Where are you going?

01:01:32.054 --> 01:01:34.833
Our future is in your hands.

01:01:36.908 --> 01:01:39.855
You cannot leave us and go.

01:01:40.216 --> 01:01:41.438
Listen to me.

01:01:43.243 --> 01:01:44.647
Kanwar!

01:01:50.239 --> 01:01:51.697
What are you doing here?

01:01:51.864 --> 01:01:53.614
Go away.

01:01:54.529 --> 01:01:55.656
Go.

01:01:56.205 --> 01:01:57.199
Kanwar!

01:01:57.426 --> 01:01:58.697
Go away from here!

01:01:59.322 --> 01:02:00.531
Go!

01:02:05.906 --> 01:02:07.614
Go away from here, Kanwar!

01:02:08.248 --> 01:02:11.239
Understand... You...
Listen to me.

01:02:13.489 --> 01:02:15.531
There is no other way.

01:02:16.292 --> 01:02:17.822
Try to understand, son.

01:02:18.739 --> 01:02:21.125
There is no other way.

01:02:22.906 --> 01:02:27.492
There will be a son in your home...
in our home.

01:02:27.572 --> 01:02:29.568
Go! Go!

01:03:33.085 --> 01:03:34.614
You're my son.

01:03:36.079 --> 01:03:37.572
You're a good son.

01:03:44.468 --> 01:03:46.726
But you're a woman.

01:03:49.310 --> 01:03:50.781
You are a girl.

01:03:52.423 --> 01:03:54.034
Papaji!

01:03:58.888 --> 01:04:01.072
We'll have a son.

01:04:02.099 --> 01:04:03.926
A real son.

01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:08.412
Papaji!

01:05:04.695 --> 01:05:06.529
You should leave now.

01:05:08.370 --> 01:05:10.570
There's gold and cash in the trunk.

01:05:10.904 --> 01:05:13.779
And I've given the keys
of my father's house to Neeli.

01:05:14.435 --> 01:05:17.154
Why didn't you protect me
as you did my sisters?

01:05:22.122 --> 01:05:23.904
I was also your child.

01:05:28.521 --> 01:05:30.070
You should go.

01:05:30.237 --> 01:05:31.404
Go!

01:05:33.311 --> 01:05:37.776
Go. You have a long journey.

01:05:39.612 --> 01:05:42.570
I have wanted so much
to sit and talk to you.

01:05:47.170 --> 01:05:48.779
And now look,

01:05:50.570 --> 01:05:53.862
you're sending me so far away from you.

01:05:59.667 --> 01:06:01.987
I will come to you.

01:06:10.034 --> 01:06:11.404
Now go!

01:06:13.029 --> 01:06:14.154
Go!

01:07:14.597 --> 01:07:15.819
Stop here.

01:08:38.952 --> 01:08:40.404
Here are my clothes.

01:08:42.490 --> 01:08:43.687
For you.

01:09:30.729 --> 01:09:33.187
While on the train coming here,
I was thinking...

01:09:38.859 --> 01:09:40.354
You are free now.

01:09:44.261 --> 01:09:46.886
You can do whatever you want.

01:09:48.232 --> 01:09:49.969
Forget your old life.

01:09:55.022 --> 01:09:57.178
Start anew here.

01:10:00.524 --> 01:10:02.303
Here, with me.

01:10:04.844 --> 01:10:07.011
You can be what you are.

01:10:23.875 --> 01:10:25.844
It was all there.

01:10:28.761 --> 01:10:30.761
I just never saw it.

01:10:33.983 --> 01:10:35.678
Your face...

01:10:39.204 --> 01:10:41.178
Your eyes...

01:11:21.844 --> 01:11:22.844
Neeli!

01:11:25.011 --> 01:11:26.553
Come here...

01:11:32.379 --> 01:11:34.636
Let me look at you.

01:11:52.930 --> 01:11:55.636
I fell in love with a woman!

01:12:15.416 --> 01:12:18.719
I, too, fell in love with a woman.

01:12:30.503 --> 01:12:32.253
Come with me.

01:12:57.538 --> 01:12:58.836
Look...

01:13:01.063 --> 01:13:02.711
Look at this beautiful woman.

01:14:31.778 --> 01:14:35.028
You should have come
to Uncle Keerath first.

01:14:35.695 --> 01:14:39.278
You should have informed us.

01:14:39.689 --> 01:14:42.231
Kanwar hasn't been too well.

01:14:42.689 --> 01:14:44.814
What happened to him? Let's go see him.

01:14:45.356 --> 01:14:48.856
Should we call a doctor?
- He doesn't really need a doctor.

01:14:50.272 --> 01:14:53.314
Let him rest then. We'll come later.
- Okay.

01:15:01.647 --> 01:15:03.272
All right.

01:15:03.689 --> 01:15:05.814
We'll come back later.

01:15:07.765 --> 01:15:09.419
Bye.
- Bye.

01:15:22.236 --> 01:15:24.777
How long can you hide like this?

01:15:27.069 --> 01:15:29.027
It would be best...

01:15:29.444 --> 01:15:31.027
if I leave...

01:15:31.736 --> 01:15:33.277
No, don't say that.

01:15:34.111 --> 01:15:36.236
What do we do then?

01:15:36.647 --> 01:15:38.986
How are we to live together?

01:15:40.722 --> 01:15:43.652
You've locked yourself in this house
and me too.

01:15:47.152 --> 01:15:51.361
Let Ma come,
then everything will be all right.

01:15:53.194 --> 01:15:55.111
Nothing will be all right, Kanwar.

01:16:01.644 --> 01:16:04.102
You can't leave me alone.

01:16:14.311 --> 01:16:16.561
I'll go and get Ma.

01:16:19.436 --> 01:16:21.644
We'll celebrate Lohri together.

01:16:34.144 --> 01:16:36.311
If we are to live together,

01:16:38.894 --> 01:16:41.019
you have to accept...

01:16:41.811 --> 01:16:44.144
that you're a woman like me.

01:16:46.493 --> 01:16:48.561
We are two women.

01:16:49.995 --> 01:16:51.269
Friends.

01:16:53.444 --> 01:16:54.769
Sisters.

01:16:56.186 --> 01:16:58.311
I put on women's clothes...

01:16:59.852 --> 01:17:03.936
it feels like
I've got scorpions all over me.

01:17:05.852 --> 01:17:09.019
I no longer know who I am,

01:17:10.186 --> 01:17:11.977
what I am.

01:17:13.743 --> 01:17:15.602
I will help you, Kanwar.

01:17:18.811 --> 01:17:20.227
I am with you.

01:17:51.802 --> 01:17:57.977
The night flows into us

01:18:04.258 --> 01:18:08.269
A serpent of passion

01:18:24.737 --> 01:18:37.314
The blood-red star ascends

01:18:37.394 --> 01:18:43.534
Soaked in love, it beckons

01:18:43.614 --> 01:18:52.128
Hold me back, someone
Hold me!

01:18:52.208 --> 01:19:00.900
The threshold pulses
Red and red

01:19:25.096 --> 01:19:26.513
Ma?

01:19:30.096 --> 01:19:31.471
Ma?

01:19:54.640 --> 01:19:56.221
Baali?

01:19:57.495 --> 01:19:58.230
Baali?

01:19:58.310 --> 01:19:59.192
Brother.

01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:06.576
Where did you go to?

01:20:08.544 --> 01:20:10.221
What happened here, Baali?

01:20:11.636 --> 01:20:13.888
Fire.
- Where is Ma?

01:20:16.393 --> 01:20:18.055
Ma died in the fire.

01:20:28.350 --> 01:20:29.409
Brother.

01:20:36.458 --> 01:20:37.755
Brother Kanwar!

01:20:43.549 --> 01:20:44.930
Get up.

01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:47.754
Get up.

01:20:54.955 --> 01:20:55.928
Baali.

01:21:14.998 --> 01:21:16.346
Baali, come with me.

01:21:17.008 --> 01:21:18.675
No, I don't.

01:21:19.906 --> 01:21:21.008
My house.

01:21:22.457 --> 01:21:24.133
I'm cleaning Papaji's room.

01:23:01.250 --> 01:23:03.500
You come with me, Baali.

01:23:03.824 --> 01:23:06.127
No. No... I have to clean.

01:23:06.646 --> 01:23:08.125
So much to do!
- Baali!

01:24:11.613 --> 01:24:17.238
If you ever loved my mother,
never set foot in this house.

01:24:22.988 --> 01:24:26.113
I'm going to take you and Neeli
back with me.

01:24:29.738 --> 01:24:31.155
Never.

01:25:10.863 --> 01:25:13.738
Is this the first Lohri since you wed?
- Yes.

01:25:14.196 --> 01:25:16.863
It would have been so good
if Kanwar were here, too!

01:25:18.571 --> 01:25:20.905
Wasn't Kanwar supposed to be back today?

01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:26.655
You have to look at me.

01:26:29.055 --> 01:26:30.405
Look at your daughter.

01:26:34.547 --> 01:26:37.071
You could never see me as I am,
could you?

01:26:39.444 --> 01:26:41.363
Now, you have to look at me.

01:26:56.637 --> 01:26:58.438
Look at your daughter.

01:27:00.550 --> 01:27:02.313
Your shameless daughter.

01:27:04.658 --> 01:27:06.605
Your worthless daughter.

01:27:08.030 --> 01:27:11.063
Standing naked in front of her father.

01:27:15.759 --> 01:27:18.855
What should I do
with this disgusting woman?

01:27:22.386 --> 01:27:24.754
I can't hide her anymore.

01:27:27.478 --> 01:27:29.730
She doesn't want to hide anymore.

01:27:32.830 --> 01:27:34.980
She doesn't listen to me anymore.

01:27:39.641 --> 01:27:41.605
She doesn't listen to anything.

01:27:46.625 --> 01:27:49.313
What do I do with this shameless girl?

01:27:51.954 --> 01:27:53.730
Where should I hide her away?

01:28:07.634 --> 01:28:10.134
She should just die.

01:28:12.468 --> 01:28:14.343
She deserves to die.

01:28:17.801 --> 01:28:19.968
What do I do now, Papaji?

01:28:23.634 --> 01:28:25.878
You always told me what to do.

01:28:27.509 --> 01:28:29.134
Why not now?

01:28:34.843 --> 01:28:36.634
Why don't you speak?

01:28:37.683 --> 01:28:39.301
Why don't you look at me?

01:28:40.472 --> 01:28:41.964
Look at me!

01:28:44.134 --> 01:28:45.759
Look at me!

01:28:47.259 --> 01:28:48.676
Look at me!

01:28:51.931 --> 01:28:55.468
He's come to take you away from me.

01:28:56.579 --> 01:28:59.134
Who?
-I can't do anything.

01:29:01.110 --> 01:29:02.801
There's nobody there.

01:29:04.191 --> 01:29:05.384
He is here.

01:29:06.245 --> 01:29:08.718
He's not going to leave us.

01:29:53.920 --> 01:29:55.051
He's come.

01:29:59.142 --> 01:30:01.509
You stay here. I'll go see.

01:30:10.926 --> 01:30:13.551
Call Kanwar.
- You know he's not here.

01:30:13.843 --> 01:30:16.468
I told you he's gone for his mother.
- Move away.

01:30:16.720 --> 01:30:18.051
I should have guessed.

01:30:18.407 --> 01:30:21.142
But it never occurred to me
that this boy is not a boy.

01:30:21.423 --> 01:30:23.429
You are disgusting!

01:30:23.639 --> 01:30:27.679
Shameless...
- I don't know what you are talking about!

01:30:27.888 --> 01:30:29.718
He'll be back with his mother
very soon.

01:30:29.996 --> 01:30:31.218
Come back then.

01:30:33.131 --> 01:30:34.551
Open the door!

01:30:34.926 --> 01:30:36.331
Break the door down!

01:30:38.947 --> 01:30:41.593
Someone saw you at the window.

01:30:41.856 --> 01:30:45.138
They're breaking down the door.
Run away!

01:30:45.337 --> 01:30:49.268
No! Let it all be over!
- You have to go.

01:30:49.348 --> 01:30:52.884
They'll kill us if they find you here.
- I'm not leaving you.

01:30:53.196 --> 01:30:55.441
I told Uncle Keerath
you'd gone for your mother.

01:30:55.521 --> 01:30:59.867
They'll calm down
if they don't find you here. Go!

01:31:46.540 --> 01:31:50.298
Kanwar, you can't leave her there alone.

01:31:50.378 --> 01:31:51.918
They will kill her.

01:32:11.989 --> 01:32:15.001
You go back
and they'll kill both of you.

01:32:21.730 --> 01:32:24.251
You are a part of me.

01:32:27.362 --> 01:32:29.668
You will always be part of me.

01:32:31.794 --> 01:32:34.126
We must save Neeli.

01:32:38.475 --> 01:32:41.584
Kanwar,
there is only one way to save her.

01:32:45.610 --> 01:32:48.834
She's going to die, Kanwar.
And you alone can't save her.

01:32:53.740 --> 01:32:56.209
But together we can.

01:33:00.323 --> 01:33:02.543
There is only one way to save her.

01:33:03.513 --> 01:33:06.084
Her and our family.

01:33:21.826 --> 01:33:23.199
My son!

01:33:26.313 --> 01:33:27.686
My moon.

01:33:40.248 --> 01:33:43.719
My son, you'll become a real man now.

01:33:55.081 --> 01:33:56.324
Papaji!

01:36:12.436 --> 01:36:14.102
She will not escape from us,

01:36:14.269 --> 01:36:16.061
this Kanwar of yours.

01:36:16.936 --> 01:36:18.977
We'll find her.

01:36:19.311 --> 01:36:21.602
Even if we have to go
to her father's house.

01:36:22.727 --> 01:36:25.186
We have seen what he really is, Neeli.

01:36:45.352 --> 01:36:47.394
What is he doing? Let's go!

01:36:48.769 --> 01:36:52.436
I am Umber Singh's son.
Do I look like a girl?

01:36:52.602 --> 01:36:55.727
What have you got us involved in,
Keerath?

01:37:35.042 --> 01:37:37.644
We are going home now, Neeli.

01:37:54.383 --> 01:37:56.269
Whom are you hitting?

01:37:59.637 --> 01:38:01.186
Neeli...

01:38:05.281 --> 01:38:06.602
Kanwar?

01:38:09.724 --> 01:38:11.436
He is here.

01:38:49.974 --> 01:38:51.686
I was so alone.

01:38:56.990 --> 01:38:59.227
Sister-in-law!

01:39:46.882 --> 01:39:48.007
Neeli...

01:39:54.136 --> 01:39:55.394
Don't worry.

01:39:58.786 --> 01:40:02.019
Don't worry.
Everything will be all right.

01:40:24.861 --> 01:40:27.769
We'll tear this house down.

01:40:30.558 --> 01:40:33.061
We'll keep nothing from the past.

01:40:39.154 --> 01:40:41.852
We'll forget everything.

01:40:48.786 --> 01:40:52.811
I'll make for us
a better house than this one.

01:41:12.198 --> 01:41:14.736
I've cheated destiny before.

01:41:16.534 --> 01:41:18.111
I was a refugee once.

01:41:18.611 --> 01:41:20.902
And I made a new life.

01:41:23.021 --> 01:41:24.736
Built a new home.

01:41:28.977 --> 01:41:31.444
We'll defeat destiny again.

01:42:58.966 --> 01:43:00.319
Neeli...

01:43:01.517 --> 01:43:05.194
How many times
must I live this tale again?

01:43:16.759 --> 01:43:19.486
Neither a man nor a woman...

01:43:21.808 --> 01:43:24.361
Neither human nor a ghost...

01:43:29.829 --> 01:43:32.027
Look at me, Neeli!

01:44:52.815 --> 01:44:55.075
Forgive me, Neeli.

01:45:12.436 --> 01:45:14.111
Free me.

01:45:18.923 --> 01:45:20.277
Free me now.

01:46:06.873 --> 01:46:12.992
The room of mangoes, O Mother!

01:46:13.317 --> 01:46:20.484
Bring the child to the room of mangoes!

01:46:20.668 --> 01:46:27.165
All pain will be assuaged, O Mother!

01:46:27.245 --> 01:46:33.964
Teach your son to walk like a fragrance!

01:46:34.202 --> 01:46:39.251
Teach your son

01:46:41.132 --> 01:46:47.932
Teach your son to walk like a fragrance!

01:46:48.603 --> 01:46:54.808
The room of mangoes, O Mother!

01:46:55.089 --> 01:47:02.299
Bring the child to the room of mangoes!

01:47:28.442 --> 01:47:36.193
I walk the path of clouds

01:47:36.831 --> 01:47:43.674
A son is born into my home! O, I fly!

01:47:44.009 --> 01:47:49.306
A son in my home!

01:47:49.707 --> 01:47:54.703
A moon glimmers in my home!

01:47:54.783 --> 01:48:00.335
I fly! I fly!

01:48:00.415 --> 01:48:05.632
A boy has come to my home, I fly!

01:48:05.913 --> 01:48:09.135
A boy has come to my home, I fly!

01:48:10.305 --> 01:48:16.689
