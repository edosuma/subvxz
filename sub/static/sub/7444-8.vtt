00:16.741 --> 00:18.174
It's a jungle out there.

00:36.981 --> 00:38.539
It's a jungle out there.

00:56.181 --> 00:57.986
Everybody's
got to earn a crust somehow,

00:58.021 --> 01:01.741
and Mario Condello's racket
was loan sharking.

01:01.776 --> 01:04.146
He didn't care who, what or why.

01:04.181 --> 01:06.346
All he was interested in
was the interest.

01:06.381 --> 01:09.741
A drug dealer walks in the door
looking to finance his next deal -

01:09.776 --> 01:11.306
no problemo.

01:11.341 --> 01:13.457
Here's 10 grand. Have a nice day.

01:17.141 --> 01:18.586
Unfortunately for our side,

01:18.621 --> 01:20.226
a few bad apples in the drug squad

01:20.261 --> 01:23.381
had their own ideas
about earning a crust.

01:23.416 --> 01:24.826
When the law finally caught up,

01:24.861 --> 01:26.738
we didn't know
whether to laugh or cry.

01:31.301 --> 01:33.786
The upside - we knew
we were clean again.

01:33.821 --> 01:36.681
The downside - the public
thought we were all dirty.

01:36.716 --> 01:39.541
Plus, it meant half the crims
serving time for drugs

01:39.576 --> 01:42.009
got a free walk
on account of tainted evidence.

01:51.341 --> 01:54.581
Around the same time
Carl Williams got out of jail free,

01:54.616 --> 01:56.946
Jason Moran finished his sentence

01:56.981 --> 01:59.779
for being a vicious, brutal,
ugly little turd.

02:05.901 --> 02:08.210
Suck my fuckin' toe jam.

02:11.101 --> 02:14.181
And then Carl, Jason,
Uncle Tom Cobbley and all

02:14.216 --> 02:16.058
got back to the business
of earning a crust.

02:24.341 --> 02:26.466
Gentlemen, your pizza.

02:26.501 --> 02:28.866
Family size.

02:28.901 --> 02:31.781
Look at this.
Look at that. OK.

02:31.816 --> 02:33.266
Enjoy.

02:33.301 --> 02:37.061
Giovanni, a little more drinks,
please, for my friends.

02:37.096 --> 02:39.421
I got to say something, alright?

02:44.301 --> 02:47.421
Hey, Jase, you need
an injection of funds,

02:47.456 --> 02:49.661
get yourself back in the business,

02:49.696 --> 02:51.106
you let me know, hmm?

02:51.141 --> 02:53.141
What, are you kidding, Mario?
Not at your rates.

02:53.176 --> 02:55.581
I'm talking about
12 months interest free.

02:55.616 --> 02:57.026
As much as you need.

02:57.061 --> 03:00.021
You think about it.
I will. Thank you.

03:00.056 --> 03:02.906
I, um... Mr Condello.

03:02.941 --> 03:04.613
Alrighty, let's eat.
Mario.

03:05.981 --> 03:07.986
There's, um, been a bit of a mix-up

03:08.021 --> 03:11.341
with your, um...
with your credit card.

03:11.376 --> 03:13.297
It's, um... it's been rejected.

03:28.301 --> 03:30.141
Might have some work for you.

03:30.176 --> 03:31.746
Oh, yeah?

03:31.781 --> 03:33.226
What might that be?

03:33.261 --> 03:36.141
I hear you like playing with guns.

03:36.176 --> 03:37.798
Who told you that?

03:37.833 --> 03:39.386
What's the going rate?

03:39.421 --> 03:41.658
Depends on who we're offing.

03:41.693 --> 03:43.895
Fat boy.
Carl Williams?

03:45.021 --> 03:46.786
You know he's a mate of mine?

03:46.821 --> 03:48.741
Why do you think I'm talking to you?

03:48.776 --> 03:50.572
You can get close to him.

03:52.781 --> 03:53.906
Why?

03:53.941 --> 03:57.021
He's been running round telling
everyone that he shot my brother.

03:57.056 --> 03:58.981
Personally, I don't think
he's a shooter's arsehole,

03:59.016 --> 04:01.026
but either way,

04:01.061 --> 04:02.901
I can't have him
taking credit for it.

04:02.936 --> 04:04.626
100 Gs.

04:04.661 --> 04:06.401
70 now, 30 after I've done it.

04:06.436 --> 04:08.141
That's if I do decide to do it.

04:08.176 --> 04:09.706
50 all up.
Fuck off.

04:09.741 --> 04:12.541
You know what? Your old man
still hasn't paid me for the last time.

04:12.576 --> 04:15.941
No, 100 Gs. 70 up-front.
Take it or leave it, Jase.

04:15.976 --> 04:17.901
60. 40/20 split.

04:17.935 --> 04:19.495
90.
70.

04:19.529 --> 04:21.053
80.
Done.

04:22.101 --> 04:24.899
He asked you to do it? Me best mate?
Mm-hm.

04:25.941 --> 04:27.621
That's outrageous.

04:27.656 --> 04:29.301
Even given me the gun.

04:29.336 --> 04:31.426
How much?

04:31.461 --> 04:33.946
80.
That's not bad.

04:33.981 --> 04:36.261
I tell you what, I'll give you 120

04:36.296 --> 04:38.541
to put him off with his own gun.

04:39.861 --> 04:42.146
Nah, hang on, that's a bit obvious.

04:42.181 --> 04:44.821
Yeah, he'd be expecting us
to come back at him.

04:44.856 --> 04:46.386
Let me think about it.

04:46.421 --> 04:49.066
And this is
Damien behind you.

04:49.101 --> 04:51.746
He's from next door.
Guess how we met?

04:51.781 --> 04:55.301
Caught him perving on me
when I was in the spa starkers.

04:55.336 --> 04:57.346
We're good mates now, but.

04:57.381 --> 04:59.906
I'm investing a sum of money in him.
Yeah.

04:59.941 --> 05:02.021
You know them one-tonne utes
with the coffee machines

05:02.056 --> 05:03.878
and the pie warmers
and shit out the back?

05:03.913 --> 05:05.807
They go round
the factories at lunchtime?

05:05.842 --> 05:07.701
Reckon I can pick up
a second-hand one

05:07.736 --> 05:09.146
for 12,000 or 14,000.

05:09.181 --> 05:11.906
He saved up half, the little champ.
I'm gonna loan him the rest.

05:11.941 --> 05:15.181
Good on you, mate. Good to see a man
put his money where his mouth is.

05:15.216 --> 05:16.701
Enjoy the party.
Good luck, Damien.

05:16.736 --> 05:18.386
Roberta, um, sorry,

05:18.421 --> 05:21.021
I... thanks for your offer
and everything, and no offence,

05:21.056 --> 05:22.986
I just reckon I'll get the money
from a bank.

05:23.021 --> 05:26.377
Oh, why, you don't like the colour
of my money - is that it?

05:28.181 --> 05:30.266
Suit yourself. Fuck.

05:30.301 --> 05:34.106
I was just trying to
throw a dog a bone.

05:34.141 --> 05:36.941
Malcolm, thanks
for coming into my home.

05:37.941 --> 05:39.186
Oh, fuck!
Ah!

05:39.221 --> 05:42.581
So that's what you do all day, huh?
You scared the hell out of me.

05:42.616 --> 05:44.173
Good to see you.
Good. Please.

05:45.501 --> 05:49.101
Hey, er, Col, I, um, just happened
to be glancing through the ledger,

05:49.136 --> 05:51.498
and there's no pressure here,
but you're late again.

05:51.533 --> 05:53.861
Late? I don't think so, mate.
It's the 20th, Col.

05:53.896 --> 05:55.613
It's the 20th already?
You're kidding me.

05:56.821 --> 06:00.501
By close of business tomorrow, yeah?
I mean, I can count on you.

06:00.536 --> 06:03.018
Yeah, alright,
just don't threaten us, OK?

06:03.053 --> 06:05.501
It's not a threat,
it's a courtesy call.

06:05.536 --> 06:07.181
Courtesy? Bullshit.

06:09.541 --> 06:12.981
$88,000 by 5:00 tomorrow,
we say no more about it.

06:13.016 --> 06:14.993
5:00 tomorrow.

06:15.028 --> 06:16.971
OK.
See ya. OK.

06:27.141 --> 06:28.586
Fuck.

06:28.621 --> 06:31.613
50 now, 50 when it's done.

06:33.341 --> 06:36.381
Carl decided the best
candidate for the Jason hit

06:36.416 --> 06:38.736
was veteran hard man Victor Peirce.

06:40.261 --> 06:42.986
50 now, 50 when we
pick up the newspaper

06:43.021 --> 06:45.933
and we read the headline
'Jason Moran Gunned Down'.

06:48.181 --> 06:49.746
Why bother me?

06:49.781 --> 06:51.915
Why don't you off him,
you weird little munchkin?

06:51.950 --> 06:54.050
Well, you used to be friends
with him, didn't you?

06:55.261 --> 06:59.661
Carl likes the, er...
What do you call it?

06:59.696 --> 07:02.021
Irony?
The irony. That's it.

07:02.056 --> 07:03.534
75/25.

07:05.021 --> 07:06.066
50/50.

07:06.101 --> 07:09.421
You think I'm gonna rip youse off?

07:09.456 --> 07:10.866
I'm a professional, sonny.

07:10.901 --> 07:12.861
If I say I'm gonna do something,
it's done.

07:12.896 --> 07:15.056
50 now, 50 later.

07:16.221 --> 07:18.974
Got it with ya?
Yeah, it's in the wagon.

07:20.661 --> 07:23.301
Any special requests?
Yeah.

07:23.336 --> 07:25.986
Use this.

07:26.021 --> 07:29.221
June 15's the anniversary
of Mark's death.

07:29.256 --> 07:31.689
Jason always visits the grave.

07:33.061 --> 07:35.052
We thought it'd be...

07:36.421 --> 07:37.866
Ironic.

07:37.901 --> 07:39.781
We believe
you may be at risk.

07:39.816 --> 07:41.658
From who?
You tell me.

07:41.693 --> 07:43.466
Shortbread?
Mmm. Ta.

07:43.501 --> 07:45.061
Whoever killed your brother.

07:45.096 --> 07:46.586
I doubt it.

07:46.621 --> 07:48.341
Not worried about
someone carrying a grudge?

07:48.376 --> 07:49.506
Nope.

07:49.541 --> 07:52.741
You can't think of anyone who might
want to hurt you? Or your family?

07:52.776 --> 07:55.261
I don't have any enemies
so why would anyone wanna hurt me?

07:55.296 --> 07:58.106
OK, I've got a deal for you.

07:58.141 --> 08:00.701
We're prepared to
ask the parole board

08:00.736 --> 08:02.278
to allow you to leave the country,

08:02.313 --> 08:03.821
provided you make it permanent.

08:03.856 --> 08:05.066
Permanent?

08:05.101 --> 08:07.381
Well, for the time being.
Till things settle down.

08:07.416 --> 08:09.346
You expect us to drag
the kids out of school,

08:09.381 --> 08:11.901
jump on a plane and never
come back, just to suit you?

08:11.936 --> 08:14.301
All we're worried about
is your family's safety.

08:14.336 --> 08:16.061
Who's gonna foot the bill, huh? Him?

08:16.096 --> 08:17.838
That's not part of the deal.

08:17.873 --> 08:19.580
You guys are pathetic. Let's go.

08:20.901 --> 08:23.301
Trish, if you want me to
speak to the parole board,

08:23.336 --> 08:24.986
just pick up the phone.

08:25.021 --> 08:27.615
Trish.
Thanks for the cuppa.

08:32.581 --> 08:36.701
Surveillance on both camps 24/7
is the only way to stop this, boss.

08:36.736 --> 08:37.746
Haven't got the budget.

08:37.780 --> 08:40.375
He could be on his way to Carl's
to knock him off right now.

08:40.409 --> 08:42.970
I can't even get my photocopier
replaced. Want another biscuit?

08:47.981 --> 08:50.415
Damien, is it? Take a pew.

08:52.221 --> 08:53.666
I need a loan, Mr Condello.

08:53.701 --> 08:56.181
Why else would you be here?
See, I've got this business plan.

08:56.216 --> 08:57.981
You know those auto...
Please, please.

08:58.016 --> 09:00.306
No details. Just the numbers.
OK.

09:00.341 --> 09:03.341
Um, I reckon I could pick up
a second-hand unit

09:03.376 --> 09:05.258
for maybe 12,000 to 14,000.

09:05.293 --> 09:07.106
I've got my own 8,000 saved up.

09:07.141 --> 09:08.981
It's just no-one's gonna
lend me the rest.

09:09.016 --> 09:10.586
Why is that? Are you a bank robber?

09:10.621 --> 09:13.121
No, I've just... got
some personal problems.

09:13.156 --> 09:15.621
I'm taking care of it.
I'm taking my medication.

09:15.656 --> 09:17.226
Good for you, young man,
good for you.

09:17.261 --> 09:20.221
Just the banks look at me
as some form of risk.

09:20.256 --> 09:23.301
Oh. That's OK.
We're not prejudiced here.

09:23.336 --> 09:24.986
Er, we'll take anyone's money.

09:25.021 --> 09:27.001
So we're talking about, what, $5,000?

09:27.036 --> 09:28.981
This is my rates,
my standard agreement.

09:29.016 --> 09:32.598
So five thou over six months at 40%

09:32.633 --> 09:36.181
would make repayments of $217 a week.

09:36.216 --> 09:38.146
That's... pretty steep.

09:38.181 --> 09:40.221
Think of me as a convenience store.

09:40.256 --> 09:42.226
You pay a premium for the service.

09:42.261 --> 09:47.494
The question is,
how bad do you want it?

10:02.581 --> 10:03.906
Sausage rolls...

10:03.941 --> 10:05.260
Don't worry about that.

10:15.341 --> 10:17.138
I hate it when he's like this.

10:18.741 --> 10:20.174
It's Mark's anniversary.

10:22.981 --> 10:24.414
Hmm.

10:30.261 --> 10:31.821
Hey.
Pass it to me!

10:31.856 --> 10:33.459
Hey.

10:35.981 --> 10:37.457
Pass it to me.

10:37.492 --> 10:38.934
You're scaring me.

10:41.661 --> 10:43.586
Why?

10:43.621 --> 10:45.901
You're worried all the time.

10:53.981 --> 10:55.778
I'll always protect you.

11:03.341 --> 11:05.571
I think we should do
what Garry Butterworth said.

11:13.941 --> 11:16.660
I don't want our kids to grow up
without their father.

11:23.141 --> 11:24.574
You want to run away?

11:25.781 --> 11:27.381
Yep.

11:32.781 --> 11:34.214
Oh, God.

11:38.061 --> 11:39.699
You got the wrong day, munchkin.

11:41.741 --> 11:42.776
You hear me?

11:44.821 --> 11:46.732
Wrong day.

11:51.101 --> 11:52.614
It's the 15th. So...

11:54.301 --> 11:56.417
Well, where is he?

11:58.861 --> 12:00.738
I wanna earn me the other 50 grand.

12:04.141 --> 12:05.666
Eh?
Eh, listen!

12:05.701 --> 12:08.169
Kick me again and I'll stab you
in the fuckin' eye, alright?

12:17.061 --> 12:18.901
Hey, sexy wheels, Damien.

12:18.936 --> 12:20.346
Oh, hey, Roberta.

12:20.381 --> 12:22.611
Hey. So this is it, eh?
Yeah. What do you reckon?

12:23.821 --> 12:25.573
Oh, it's beautiful, mate.

12:26.901 --> 12:29.021
Hey, um, no hard feelings, eh?

12:29.056 --> 12:30.534
No.
Yeah?

12:34.541 --> 12:37.226
So how much did it put you back?

12:37.261 --> 12:39.092
Yeah, bit more than I thought.
Yeah?

12:54.181 --> 12:57.146
When Jason announced
he was heading off overseas,

12:57.181 --> 13:00.781
the Carlton Crew passed the hat
around to help him on his way -

13:00.816 --> 13:03.261
the size of the contributions
directly proportional

13:03.296 --> 13:05.421
to the size of the donor's ego.

13:06.421 --> 13:09.026
$15,000.
Whoa, whoa. Mario, that's...

13:09.061 --> 13:12.421
Hey, you need extra,
you make a reverse-charge call

13:12.456 --> 13:14.578
to your Uncle Mario.

13:14.613 --> 13:16.666
Thank you. Thank you.

13:16.701 --> 13:18.621
Yeah, good man.
Good man, Mario.

13:18.656 --> 13:20.339
Thank you. Boys.

13:21.741 --> 13:22.826
Boys...

13:22.861 --> 13:24.621
Even the loyal retainers
and hangers-on

13:24.656 --> 13:26.066
were expected to chip in.

13:26.101 --> 13:29.980
Bon voyage, Jason.
Have a safe trip.

13:35.581 --> 13:36.536
Benji.

13:37.821 --> 13:41.061
Don't, er... don't forget
our little arrangement.

13:41.096 --> 13:42.026
Right.

13:42.061 --> 13:44.734
I'll be keeping an eye on things
while I'm away.

13:48.341 --> 13:49.774
Stay healthy.

13:51.021 --> 13:54.021
Hey, what are you doing? Come on,
let's get a drink! Come on!

13:54.056 --> 13:56.226
Jesus.

13:56.261 --> 13:58.181
Everybody, where are the girls?

13:58.216 --> 14:00.101
What sort of a party is this?

14:14.381 --> 14:16.581
Why didn't you stab him
when you had the chance?

14:16.616 --> 14:18.060
Hired Peirce to do that.

14:19.461 --> 14:22.581
What about Jase?
Hey, how can he piss off overseas?

14:22.616 --> 14:24.261
I mean, what about
his parole conditions?

14:24.296 --> 14:26.581
The cops leaned on the parole board.

14:28.501 --> 14:30.341
You're the one that postponed it
till Mark's anniversary.

14:30.376 --> 14:33.253
Go back to Peirce
and get me my deposit back now.

14:36.581 --> 14:38.986
Please?

14:39.021 --> 14:41.381
Would you do me that favour, Benj?

14:41.416 --> 14:43.146
Hey, come on, mate.

14:43.181 --> 14:45.421
I'll make it worth your while.
Eh? Eh? Come on.

14:45.456 --> 14:48.226
Alright. He's not gonna
like it, though.

14:48.261 --> 14:50.775
How long's it take to hang up
a couple of G-strings?

14:53.181 --> 14:56.021
Lew Caine
was barely earning a crust

14:56.056 --> 14:58.826
as general gopher and dogsbody
to Mick Gatto.

14:58.861 --> 15:01.981
Inspired by his upwardly mobile
lawyer girlfriend,

15:02.016 --> 15:04.211
he wanted a bigger slice
of the action.

15:34.381 --> 15:36.346
Are you OK?

15:36.381 --> 15:38.781
Yeah, I'm good. No, I'm good.

15:38.816 --> 15:40.339
Yeah?

15:41.901 --> 15:43.732
Think it's time I went
into business for myself.

15:46.021 --> 15:48.106
Yeah.

15:48.141 --> 15:50.861
It's better than running errands
for Mick Gatto, yeah?

15:50.896 --> 15:53.946
Yeah, too right.
Yeah.

15:53.981 --> 15:56.061
You could do a TAFE course
or something.

15:56.096 --> 15:57.866
A TAFE course?
Yeah.

15:57.901 --> 15:59.821
Set yourself up as a handyman
or something.

15:59.856 --> 16:01.741
I've always been good
at screwing things.

16:01.776 --> 16:03.174
Mmm.

16:08.741 --> 16:10.174
I just want you to be happy.

16:11.661 --> 16:13.652
I am happy. Fuckin' hell.

16:16.861 --> 16:18.786
Ohh.

16:18.821 --> 16:20.906
What have you got in mind?

16:20.941 --> 16:24.741
Thought I'd, er, go into partnership
with Benji Veniamin.

16:24.776 --> 16:25.776
Oh.

16:30.461 --> 16:33.381
What's up, munchkin?

16:33.416 --> 16:35.026
Heard the news?

16:35.061 --> 16:37.421
Jason's skipped the country.
Yeah, I get the mail too.

16:37.456 --> 16:39.101
Yeah, I want the deposit back.

16:39.136 --> 16:40.626
Get stuffed.

16:40.661 --> 16:42.981
Job's cancelled.
I consider it on hold.

16:43.016 --> 16:45.266
What, you're gonna make me ask twice?

16:45.301 --> 16:47.141
Is that why he's here?
Is he your muscle?

16:47.176 --> 16:48.699
No, I don't need extra muscle.

16:50.261 --> 16:51.861
Just give me the gun and the money.

16:51.896 --> 16:52.906
Piss off.

16:52.941 --> 16:55.580
That goes for you
and your boyfriend.

16:58.221 --> 16:59.821
Look, there is no deposit.
I spent it.

17:01.341 --> 17:04.901
That gun's a piece of junk.
I wouldn't embarrass myself.

17:04.935 --> 17:06.861
That's Carl Williams's money, mate.

17:06.896 --> 17:08.586
He's gonna spew.

17:08.621 --> 17:10.386
Carl Williams is a fuckin' amateur

17:10.421 --> 17:12.332
that couldn't blow
the head off a beer.

17:13.621 --> 17:15.498
Don't insult my reputation.

17:23.181 --> 17:24.296
Righto.

17:31.701 --> 17:33.661
This what you do for Carl Williams?

17:33.696 --> 17:35.106
How's Gatto feel about it?

17:35.141 --> 17:36.781
Well, you do what
you gotta do, Lew.

17:36.816 --> 17:38.817
It's all about earning the cash.

17:57.541 --> 17:58.496
Si?

18:02.101 --> 18:05.101
I'm late. I'll have it to you
by close of business tomorrow, yeah?

18:05.136 --> 18:07.941
No problem. Yeah, all of it.

18:07.976 --> 18:09.772
Ciao.

18:27.941 --> 18:32.021
Hey, Col. You're early
this month, huh?

18:32.056 --> 18:33.506
Good to see you.

18:33.541 --> 18:35.941
Look at you. I mean, how come
you always look so fit?

18:35.976 --> 18:38.186
You know, you're relaxed,
you're healthy, Mario.

18:38.221 --> 18:40.661
Well, you ought to see the
stressed-out portrait in the attic.

18:40.696 --> 18:43.021
Sit down. Now, I hope you're not
expecting a discount.

18:43.056 --> 18:45.146
No, no, Mario, mate,

18:45.181 --> 18:49.386
the truth is, things are quiet,
turnover's down.

18:49.421 --> 18:52.421
Now, there's no way I can make
a repayment on the 20th.

18:52.456 --> 18:54.078
Oh, Col, come on.
Don't disappoint me.

18:54.113 --> 18:55.647
I know...
Please, don't disappoint me.

18:55.682 --> 18:57.146
It's 88 grand. I mean, shit, Mario.

18:57.181 --> 18:59.861
That's a fucking lot of money
to find every month.

18:59.896 --> 19:01.306
You don't think I know that?

19:01.341 --> 19:02.946
How do you think I got the finance

19:02.981 --> 19:05.061
to put you into the business
in the first place?

19:05.096 --> 19:06.586
I borrowed it.

19:06.621 --> 19:09.141
Which means each and every month
I have repayments just like you.

19:09.176 --> 19:11.821
You default, I'm at risk
of defaulting too.

19:11.856 --> 19:14.421
Hey, listen, you don't pay up,

19:14.456 --> 19:16.026
my family goes hungry.

19:16.061 --> 19:18.941
Come on, you can understand that.

19:18.976 --> 19:21.821
Look, I got you a present, alright?

19:21.856 --> 19:23.459
Now, I hope...

19:24.501 --> 19:26.821
I hope you accept these Cuban cigars

19:26.856 --> 19:29.210
as a token of good faith.

19:31.181 --> 19:32.821
Ahh.
Is that good?

19:32.856 --> 19:33.861
Nice.
Nice?

19:33.896 --> 19:34.816
Nice.

19:36.941 --> 19:38.386
I've got to say one thing.

19:38.421 --> 19:40.421
I'm still gonna see you on the 20th.

19:40.456 --> 19:42.377
The 20th.
OK.

19:43.421 --> 19:44.979
Alright.

19:46.221 --> 19:48.132
You fucking wog bastard.

19:55.901 --> 19:57.653
Time for your party trick.

20:03.021 --> 20:05.226
How long are you gonna be?
I don't know.

20:05.261 --> 20:08.316
Just got to see a bloke about something
up the road. Few minutes?

20:08.351 --> 20:11.371
I've got the stopwatch on you.
Just put the coffee machine on.

20:31.301 --> 20:33.795
No. No! NO!

20:33.830 --> 20:36.290
Oh, my God!

20:54.061 --> 20:56.281
Hey. How's big Mick?

20:56.316 --> 20:58.228
Yeah, he's good.

20:58.263 --> 21:00.106
How's the job?

21:00.141 --> 21:01.706
Doing a little bit of work

21:01.741 --> 21:03.901
for another company as well
at the moment -

21:03.936 --> 21:05.866
Williams and Williams.

21:05.901 --> 21:07.621
What do they do for a crust?

21:07.656 --> 21:09.066
Deliveries.

21:09.101 --> 21:11.181
Oh. So you're a delivery driver.

21:11.216 --> 21:12.626
Something like that.

21:12.661 --> 21:14.297
And they let you dress like that?

21:14.332 --> 21:15.933
Yeah, I got a uniform at work.

21:19.221 --> 21:21.961
Was that a gun I saw in your room?

21:21.996 --> 21:24.728
Yeah. I do security for 'em as well.

21:24.763 --> 21:27.461
Security guard?
Little shit like you?

21:28.821 --> 21:31.461
Yeah, come in
if you're good-Iooking.

21:31.496 --> 21:34.101
Hey, Apollo. How are you?
Hey, Lew.

21:34.136 --> 21:35.626
Hey. Beer's in the fridge.

21:35.661 --> 21:37.266
Oh, thanks, mate.
Help yourself, Lew.

21:37.301 --> 21:39.940
You right?
Yeah. Get me one as well, yeah?

21:44.461 --> 21:46.133
It was you, wasn't it?

21:49.501 --> 21:51.173
Come on. Peirce - it was you.

21:52.821 --> 21:54.493
I don't know
what you're talking about.

21:57.181 --> 21:58.866
You little fuckin' shit.

21:58.901 --> 22:00.941
There's a story,
if you want to hear it.

22:00.976 --> 22:02.501
You in the mood to party?

22:08.461 --> 22:10.721
# Don't you wanna be

22:10.756 --> 22:12.946
# A personality?

22:12.981 --> 22:15.146
# An ocean in the sea?

22:15.181 --> 22:18.021
# But you'll never make it
if you can't shake it

22:18.056 --> 22:20.701
# So don't mistake it
Just try and fake it

22:20.736 --> 22:22.858
# And I want you to know

22:22.893 --> 22:25.017
# You don't have far to go

22:25.052 --> 22:27.106
# So we'll use all your dough

22:27.141 --> 22:29.821
# To buy new clothes
and see what flows

22:29.856 --> 22:32.478
# And powder your nose
for those photos

22:32.513 --> 22:35.066
# 'Cause there's nobody else like you

22:35.101 --> 22:40.041
# And we sure care
just what you're doing

22:40.076 --> 22:44.981
# After we have gone
our separate ways

22:45.016 --> 22:46.306
# Yeah

22:46.341 --> 22:48.561
# So don't you wanna be

22:48.596 --> 22:50.888
# A big-time entity?

22:50.923 --> 22:53.146
# Your place in history?

22:53.181 --> 22:55.786
# But don't be scared
of what we said

22:55.821 --> 22:58.741
# 'Cause there's no end
to being your friend

22:58.776 --> 23:01.106
# But there's so many round like you

23:01.141 --> 23:04.741
# And we don't care
just what you're doing

23:04.776 --> 23:08.341
# After we have gone
our separate ways

23:08.376 --> 23:10.278
# Yeah, yeah

23:10.313 --> 23:12.047
# Yeah. #

23:12.082 --> 23:13.746
Aaaargh!

23:13.781 --> 23:16.241
Should get you started.

23:16.276 --> 23:18.666
What is this? A loan?

23:18.701 --> 23:20.976
No, mate, you can keep that.

23:22.101 --> 23:23.295
You serious?

23:50.381 --> 23:52.133
This is to say sorry.

24:00.461 --> 24:03.055
You made me feel dirty.

24:15.341 --> 24:16.774
I...

24:24.621 --> 24:27.499
Look, I was inside
for a long time. I...

24:29.101 --> 24:32.696
I just... fuckin' forgot
how to behave.

24:34.101 --> 24:36.146
And, er...

24:36.181 --> 24:39.856
I mean, I see a girl and I want her.
It's just as simple as that.

24:42.621 --> 24:44.577
Fuck.

24:44.612 --> 24:46.533
Fuck!

24:50.621 --> 24:52.498
Fuck.

24:54.581 --> 24:56.537
Will it happen again?

24:58.301 --> 25:00.337
Hmm?

25:01.981 --> 25:03.506
Will it happen again?

25:03.541 --> 25:05.930
Not if you're here when I want you.

25:07.101 --> 25:09.410
Fuck. No...

25:13.781 --> 25:15.339
Not if you're here when I need you.

25:35.061 --> 25:37.861
The party drug business
had become a mega business.

25:37.896 --> 25:40.021
An eccy could be produced
for around a buck

25:40.056 --> 25:41.786
and sold in the clubs for over 20.

25:41.821 --> 25:45.461
Of course, the really greedy drug
barons could make even more profit

25:45.496 --> 25:47.421
by cutting the good stuff
with codeine or caffeine

25:47.456 --> 25:48.958
or anything else handy.

25:48.993 --> 25:50.426
Tough luck on the kids

25:50.461 --> 25:53.561
and tough luck on the street-level
dealers trying to peddle the rubbish,

25:53.596 --> 25:56.661
especially the ones who'd borrowed
money to finance their operation.

25:56.696 --> 25:59.466
And middlemen like
Nik 'The Russian' Radev,

25:59.501 --> 26:02.661
who bought the product in bulk
and supplied the street-level dealers,

26:02.696 --> 26:05.380
they were caught fair and square
in the middle.

26:18.381 --> 26:21.466
Nik. Cold beer or hot pussy?

26:21.501 --> 26:24.141
Please, Tony, it is not
fucking social call.

26:24.176 --> 26:25.821
You will give me guarantee now.

26:25.856 --> 26:27.266
No more shit pills.

26:27.301 --> 26:29.481
Hey, Nik, we're the first
to admit there's...

26:29.516 --> 26:31.661
Shut up, fat boy.
You want to fuck with me?

26:31.696 --> 26:33.461
Come on, it's just
a misunderstanding.

26:33.496 --> 26:35.186
We feel bad about it too, yeah?

26:35.221 --> 26:37.426
We got this new cook
down from Sydney. Josh.

26:37.461 --> 26:40.341
At great expense too, 'cause
he's supposed to be the business.

26:40.376 --> 26:42.146
Turns out he's been stiffin' us.

26:42.181 --> 26:44.141
He's been cuttin' the top-end
product with caffeine,

26:44.176 --> 26:45.621
pocketing the rest for himself.

26:45.656 --> 26:46.586
Come on!

26:46.621 --> 26:48.861
Hey, I feel betrayed about it,
personally, you know?

26:48.896 --> 26:50.598
And I know Tony does too,
right, Tone?

26:50.633 --> 26:52.527
Yeah, yeah, devastated. Devastated.

26:52.562 --> 26:54.421
How long I do business with you, eh?

26:54.456 --> 26:55.906
And now you do this to me?

26:55.941 --> 26:59.061
You tell me this is cook fault?
Fuck! Come on!

26:59.096 --> 27:00.786
We straightened him out.
He's on notice.

27:00.821 --> 27:03.261
Everything's back on track.
Let me talk to him.

27:03.296 --> 27:05.701
I want to meet this cook.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

27:05.736 --> 27:07.146
I don't think so, Nik.

27:07.181 --> 27:08.626
I can't do that.

27:08.661 --> 27:12.141
I want to hear from his mouth.
I don't fucking believe you two.

27:12.176 --> 27:13.986
I will meet him

27:14.021 --> 27:15.866
or you and me is kaput.

27:15.901 --> 27:17.946
You know what this means? Huh?

27:17.981 --> 27:21.101
You know what this means, fat boy?
Yeah, I know what 'kaput' means.

27:21.136 --> 27:23.217
OK, you understand situation.

27:28.381 --> 27:30.626
G'day, Josh?

27:30.661 --> 27:33.341
Yeah, I got a Mr Radev here.
He wants to meet you.

27:33.376 --> 27:35.146
Yes, Mr Williams.

27:35.181 --> 27:38.141
Tell Mr Radev I'll look forward
to meeting him very soon. 'Bye.

27:38.176 --> 27:41.346
Five minutes.
I should be the shooter.

27:41.381 --> 27:44.541
You've been out of jail five minutes
and the world owes you a living.

27:44.576 --> 27:46.546
No. I just think
I'm better than you.

27:46.581 --> 27:48.861
How do you know I'm not
the best fucking shooter

27:48.896 --> 27:50.341
in the history of organised crime?

27:50.376 --> 27:52.586
That's not fair.

27:52.621 --> 27:54.501
Driver only gets 30.
Shooter gets 70.

27:54.536 --> 27:56.106
Standard industry practice.

27:56.141 --> 27:58.101
I really need the extra dosh.
Yeah, you said.

27:58.136 --> 28:01.066
For my business.
Your business?

28:01.101 --> 28:02.978
Yeah, I'm opening a creperie
in St Kilda.

28:04.461 --> 28:06.611
I thought I was a fuckin' head case.

28:52.901 --> 28:53.906
Fuck you!

28:53.941 --> 28:57.172
FUCK YOU! FUCK YOU!

28:59.061 --> 29:00.641
FUCK YOU!

29:00.676 --> 29:02.186
FUCK!

29:02.221 --> 29:04.106
Fuck you!

29:04.141 --> 29:06.341
Get back in the fucking car.

29:06.376 --> 29:07.774
ARGGH!

29:09.901 --> 29:11.501
Got him!
Got him!

29:11.536 --> 29:13.066
Oh, fuck. Got him!

29:13.101 --> 29:15.301
I got him. I got him.
Fuck, I got him.

29:15.336 --> 29:16.986
I got him.
I fucking got him.

29:17.021 --> 29:18.661
I fucking got him!
I fucking got him!

29:18.696 --> 29:20.358
You didn't fucking get him,
I got him!

29:20.393 --> 29:22.021
Fuck you!
No, man, I fucking got him!

29:27.261 --> 29:29.461
Possibly the only person
who genuinely mourned

29:29.496 --> 29:31.066
Nik the Russian's death,

29:31.101 --> 29:32.661
apart from Danielle McGuire, that is,

29:32.696 --> 29:34.706
was his dentist.

29:34.741 --> 29:38.131
He still owed him 55 grand
for a full set of crowns.

29:42.741 --> 29:45.826
All we can say at the present moment

29:45.861 --> 29:48.741
is that it has the hallmarks
of an underworld killing.

29:48.776 --> 29:50.186
What are police doing to crack down

29:50.221 --> 29:52.861
on what's obviously
an escalating underworld war?

29:52.896 --> 29:54.426
I wouldn't call it a war.

29:54.461 --> 29:57.180
18 bodies on the streets?
What else would you call it?

29:59.101 --> 30:01.621
No comment. Thank you.

30:03.101 --> 30:05.066
Worst part of the job.
Detective Brownlow...

30:05.101 --> 30:07.181
They found shell casings
from two different guns.

30:07.216 --> 30:09.518
Is that one man with two guns
or two gunmen?

30:09.553 --> 30:11.821
Jeepers, don't tell me
they're multiplying.

30:11.856 --> 30:13.777
Inspector...

30:23.701 --> 30:25.506
My second shot
hit him in the heart.

30:25.541 --> 30:27.226
He was already fuckin' dead,
you spastic.

30:27.261 --> 30:29.101
Mate, you were spraying bullets
all over the place.

30:29.136 --> 30:30.581
You're lucky
you didn't shoot yourself.

30:30.616 --> 30:32.026
Why'd you bring a gun along anyway?

30:32.061 --> 30:34.101
'Cause I knew you'd make
a dog's breakfast of it.

30:34.136 --> 30:36.141
You're the only
fuckin' dog around here.

30:36.176 --> 30:37.918
Say what? What?

30:37.953 --> 30:39.626
Woof woof, fleabag.

30:39.661 --> 30:42.581
Yeah? Come on!
Knock it off! Knock it off!

30:42.616 --> 30:45.381
KNOCK IT OFF!

30:45.416 --> 30:47.226
JESUS!

30:47.261 --> 30:50.306
This is my home here.

30:50.341 --> 30:54.701
What do you want me to do? Call
the coroner? Get a ballistics report?

30:54.736 --> 30:58.011
Who cares who fired the fatal shot?
The prick's dead, alright?

31:01.981 --> 31:03.812
Now, we've all got
a vested interest in this.

31:05.501 --> 31:07.621
So what I'm gonna do
is split the fee 50/50.

31:07.656 --> 31:09.266
Oh...

31:09.301 --> 31:11.451
And I want youse to shake on it.

31:22.061 --> 31:25.381
That was the first time
Carl Williams commissioned a murder

31:25.416 --> 31:27.118
for purely business reasons.

31:27.153 --> 31:28.786
It wouldn't be the last.

31:28.821 --> 31:31.761
An important milestone was reached
in our world too.

31:31.796 --> 31:34.701
Because of the brazen nature
of the Nik Radev murder,

31:34.736 --> 31:37.146
a special taskforce
was formed to tackle

31:37.181 --> 31:41.666
what the press were starting to call
the gangland war.

31:41.701 --> 31:45.861
Todd McDonald and Garry Butterworth
famously hated each other's guts.

31:45.896 --> 31:48.941
To me, Todd always looked like
he'd just climbed out of a saddle

31:48.976 --> 31:50.998
and tied up his horse outside.

31:51.033 --> 31:53.021
Do you all know why you're here?

31:53.056 --> 31:54.866
Course they do, Garry.

31:54.901 --> 31:58.506
Welcome to Taskforce Purana, folks.

31:58.541 --> 32:01.981
Sure, we're a small team
but we're a united team.

32:02.016 --> 32:04.501
From now on,
you've got a single focus -

32:04.536 --> 32:06.866
gangland murders.

32:06.901 --> 32:11.019
Garry and I want all the killers
walking our streets locked up.

32:13.421 --> 32:15.218
So what's it mean, boss? 'Purana'?

32:18.101 --> 32:20.821
Don't ask me.
The computer generated the name.

32:20.856 --> 32:23.779
But what it's going to mean
is up to you.

32:31.581 --> 32:33.378
It's looking good, Damien.
Yeah.

32:35.501 --> 32:37.306
Oh, hey, Roberta,
can I borrow your car?

32:37.341 --> 32:40.666
What if I want to use it?
Um... walk. Do you good.

32:40.701 --> 32:44.141
Get rid of those love handles.
Take care of it, smart-arse.

32:52.701 --> 32:54.739
Oh, my God!
Arggh!

32:54.774 --> 32:56.778
Damien!

32:59.061 --> 33:01.161
You right? Shit!

33:01.196 --> 33:03.226
ARRGGH!
Is he OK?

33:03.261 --> 33:05.661
Can you... You gotta
ring for an ambulance!

33:07.421 --> 33:10.015
We're gonna get someone here, mate.
Mate, mate, mate!

33:15.381 --> 33:17.381
Damien, what the hell
happened to you?

33:17.416 --> 33:19.426
I had an accident, Mr Condello.

33:19.461 --> 33:21.781
Sit down, sit down.
Tibor, help the boy. Go on.

33:21.816 --> 33:25.137
Take it easy. Come on. Relax.

33:26.381 --> 33:28.226
What's going on?

33:28.261 --> 33:32.261
I, er... I'm not gonna be able
to drive the truck anymore.

33:32.296 --> 33:34.866
I... I don't know how I'II...

33:34.901 --> 33:37.421
The doctor said I won't be
back on deck for months.

33:37.456 --> 33:39.730
So they're gonna pin my ankle and...

33:41.661 --> 33:44.941
<i>... I don't know how I'm gonna
make the repayments.</i>

33:44.976 --> 33:47.614
So I was wondering if maybe just...

33:47.649 --> 33:50.252
<i>... an extension or something.</i>

33:58.741 --> 34:00.306
I tell you what I'll do.

34:00.341 --> 34:04.226
And this is only because I like you.

34:04.261 --> 34:08.460
I'll accept goods
in lieu of the outstanding balance.

34:08.496 --> 34:10.186
How's that?

34:10.221 --> 34:12.906
Goods?
Yeah, items of value.

34:12.940 --> 34:17.181
Jewellery, family heirlooms,
objet d'art...

34:17.216 --> 34:19.775
...vehicles.

34:27.181 --> 34:29.940
You can't take that!
That's Nanna's best dinner service.

34:29.976 --> 34:32.706
Mr Condello, it's gonna kill her.
Please!

34:32.741 --> 34:35.972
Fuckin' blood-suckin' wop!
Put that stuff back.

34:37.420 --> 34:39.981
Come on, give that back.
Put that stuff back.

34:40.016 --> 34:41.414
You turd!

34:44.661 --> 34:46.186
I hope you're happy, dickhead -

34:46.221 --> 34:49.021
you fuckin' eyetie, arsewipe,
shitty, greasy arse monkey!

34:49.056 --> 34:50.579
Prick!

34:52.781 --> 34:54.226
My truck.

34:54.261 --> 34:55.866
Come on, get out of the way.

34:55.900 --> 34:57.781
He was hit by a car, you dickhead.

34:57.816 --> 34:59.778
He was hit by a car.

34:59.813 --> 35:01.706
Arsehole!

35:01.741 --> 35:03.572
Damien, I'm sorry, mate, I'm sorry.

35:12.701 --> 35:17.226
50, 60... 61,000.

35:17.261 --> 35:19.386
27 grand short. A lot of money, Col.

35:19.421 --> 35:21.141
Yeah, well, you'll get the rest
Monday, alright?

35:21.176 --> 35:22.586
Monday?
Absolute latest.

35:22.621 --> 35:24.521
You've been in the wars, my friend.

35:24.556 --> 35:26.588
Yeah, someone attacked us
last night.

35:26.623 --> 35:28.621
Hit me from behind,
gave us a kicking.

35:28.656 --> 35:30.179
It was a fucking mongrel act.

35:31.461 --> 35:33.066
So, Col,

35:33.101 --> 35:36.810
tell us about these Rollers of yours.

35:47.781 --> 35:50.226
Bit light on, Mario.
What's up? Bad month?

35:50.261 --> 35:53.181
Ah, well, no need to complain
about this, that and the other, Lewis.

35:53.216 --> 35:55.061
Hmm. That's what you said last time.

35:55.096 --> 35:56.654
Ah, but this time

35:56.689 --> 35:58.212
there's a sweetener.

36:52.101 --> 36:53.666
Hello.

36:53.701 --> 36:55.419
Damien? Yeah?

37:04.981 --> 37:06.414
Yeah.

37:13.661 --> 37:15.094
OK.

37:23.381 --> 37:25.576
Kid I know just died.

37:28.021 --> 37:30.137
He topped himself.

37:55.981 --> 37:59.866
Just wish that I'd forced him
to take my money

37:59.901 --> 38:03.181
instead of going to that
mother-fucking blood-sucking wop.

38:09.861 --> 38:11.658
You can't change
someone else's life.

38:13.781 --> 38:16.534
Your own, maybe.

38:17.741 --> 38:19.777
That's if you want it bad enough.

38:26.301 --> 38:27.256
What?

38:28.941 --> 38:31.819
I've never met
anyone like you before.

38:34.821 --> 38:37.574
That's 'cause there's only one
Benji Veniamin on the planet.

38:38.941 --> 38:40.581
How come they call you that?

38:40.616 --> 38:42.856
What, Benji?
Yeah.

38:44.101 --> 38:46.186
When I was a kid,

38:46.221 --> 38:49.066
if the jacks ever picked me up,

38:49.101 --> 38:51.701
I used to call myself Andy Benjamin.

38:51.736 --> 38:54.341
Veniamin, Benjamin.

38:54.376 --> 38:55.774
Benji.

39:00.301 --> 39:02.212
I made your T-shirt all soggy.

39:42.301 --> 39:44.059
How come they call you that?

39:44.094 --> 39:45.818
Benji?
Yeah.

39:47.061 --> 39:49.226
When I was a kid,

39:49.261 --> 39:51.226
if the jacks ever picked me up,

39:51.261 --> 39:54.821
I used to call myself Andy Benjamin.

39:54.856 --> 39:56.786
Veniamin, Benjamin.

39:56.821 --> 40:00.097
Benji is really Andrew Veniamin.

40:01.661 --> 40:05.449
At last, we put a face
to the name of our biggest problem.

40:31.501 --> 40:33.506
They shoot me, they beat up Tony,

40:33.541 --> 40:35.736
and now they drive our next-door
neighbour to his death.

40:36.821 --> 40:38.461
Who are we talking about?
Them Carlton bastards.

40:38.496 --> 40:42.226
Gatto, Condello, Kinniburgh, Moran.

40:42.261 --> 40:44.172
They're dead, mate.
They're fuckin' history.

40:47.221 --> 40:48.857
Let me at 'em, Carl.

40:48.892 --> 40:50.493
I need the extra dosh.

40:52.021 --> 40:54.781
Yep. Everybody's
gotta earn a crust somehow.

40:54.816 --> 40:56.772
You can do it thumping a bloke.

40:58.461 --> 40:59.426
FUCK YOU!

40:59.461 --> 41:01.019
You can do it bumpin' a bloke.

41:03.141 --> 41:06.178
You can do it charging
a million per cent interest.

41:08.421 --> 41:11.878
But all the gangsters agree
the best way of earning a crust

41:11.913 --> 41:15.336
is when it's the other poor bugger
who does all the work.
