00:01.875 --> 00:04.750
Frankie, you really want to

00:01.875 --> 00:04.750
keep making the video?

00:04.792 --> 00:07.041
Somebody has to

00:04.792 --> 00:07.041
document this, Cody.

00:07.083 --> 00:09.208
It's not every day

00:07.083 --> 00:09.208
your entire island

00:09.250 --> 00:11.208
gets teleported

00:09.250 --> 00:11.208
to the Arctic.

00:12.375 --> 00:15.125
Digging up Griffin Rock's

00:12.375 --> 00:15.125
75-year-old time capsule

00:15.166 --> 00:18.542
was a big surprise

00:15.166 --> 00:18.542
in lots of ways.

00:18.583 --> 00:22.709
Only one thing was inside--

00:18.583 --> 00:22.709
a teleportation crystal

00:22.750 --> 00:25.291
put there by a scientist

00:22.750 --> 00:25.291
to keep it safe.

00:25.333 --> 00:27.750
But it wasn't.

00:25.333 --> 00:27.750
Lightning hit the crystal.

00:27.792 --> 00:31.250
And when it touched the

00:27.792 --> 00:31.250
reactaline veins underground,

00:31.291 --> 00:33.583
the whole island disappeared.

00:33.625 --> 00:36.083
We showed up here on a glacier

00:36.125 --> 00:38.542
thousands of miles from Maine.

00:38.583 --> 00:41.250
If Doc Green hadn't put up

00:38.583 --> 00:41.250
a dome to protect the island,

00:41.291 --> 00:44.542
we'd all be frozen by now.

00:44.583 --> 00:46.750
I'm afraid it's worse

00:44.583 --> 00:46.750
than I thought.

00:46.792 --> 00:50.375
Without external power, the dome

00:46.792 --> 00:50.375
won't last more than a day.

00:50.417 --> 00:52.667
And the phones

00:50.417 --> 00:52.667
still aren't working.

00:52.709 --> 00:54.542
We're on our own.

00:54.583 --> 00:57.125
If Graham and I hadn't taken

00:54.583 --> 00:57.125
the Sigma apart for maintenance,

00:57.166 --> 00:58.375
we could fly for help.

00:58.417 --> 00:59.667
Blades and I will go.

00:59.709 --> 01:02.291
I don't like it,

00:59.709 --> 01:02.291
but we're out of options.

01:02.333 --> 01:03.834
Be careful, you two.

01:03.875 --> 01:05.667
I'll open the dome.

01:17.875 --> 01:19.250
Blade, what was that?

01:19.291 --> 01:21.875
I don't know,

01:19.291 --> 01:21.875
but here comes more of it.

02:05.709 --> 02:08.792
Chief, tell Doc

02:05.709 --> 02:08.792
to lower the dome.

02:08.834 --> 02:10.667
We're on it.

02:24.500 --> 02:26.959
Dani, my rotors are frozen.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.625
Try to keep them moving,

02:27.000 --> 02:30.625
Blades. We're going down.

02:30.667 --> 02:32.583
Blades, transform.

02:39.166 --> 02:41.083
It's worse

02:39.166 --> 02:41.083
than I thought out here.

02:41.125 --> 02:45.667
Let's get back inside

02:41.125 --> 02:45.667
before I ice up, too.

02:45.709 --> 02:47.291
( shivers )

02:49.041 --> 02:53.166
We need an evacuation plan.

02:49.041 --> 02:53.166
If we stay here, we'll freeze.

02:53.208 --> 02:54.875
You mean leave

02:53.208 --> 02:54.875
the island behind?

02:54.917 --> 02:56.667
Come on, Doc.

02:56.709 --> 02:58.166
Isn't there something on

02:56.709 --> 02:58.166
your best-left-forgotten shelf

02:58.208 --> 02:59.792
that would help out here?

02:59.834 --> 03:02.583
Not unless you'd like to be

02:59.834 --> 03:02.583
transmogrified

03:02.625 --> 03:04.834
or ingested by living ooze.

03:04.875 --> 03:06.208
Been there,

03:04.875 --> 03:06.208
done those.

03:06.250 --> 03:08.625
What about floatium?

03:08.667 --> 03:11.291
You're getting as hard

03:08.667 --> 03:11.291
to understand as Graham, Code.

03:11.333 --> 03:13.709
Maybe we could use it

03:11.333 --> 03:13.709
to fill the dome

03:13.750 --> 03:15.125
and float the island home.

03:15.166 --> 03:18.041
Like tying balloons to a house

03:15.166 --> 03:18.041
to make it fly.

03:18.083 --> 03:19.875
I saw that in a movie.

03:19.917 --> 03:22.542
Ooh, do you think

03:19.917 --> 03:22.542
we'll get to meet talking dogs?

03:22.583 --> 03:25.250
Hmm, floatium would get us

03:22.583 --> 03:25.250
in the air,

03:25.291 --> 03:28.083
but it won't fly us anywhere,

03:25.291 --> 03:28.083
and how do we steer?

03:28.125 --> 03:29.834
The Sigma's rocket.

03:29.875 --> 03:32.041
It'll give us propulsion

03:29.875 --> 03:32.041
and steering.

03:32.083 --> 03:34.208
That might actually work.

03:34.250 --> 03:36.959
Floatium lasts longer

03:34.250 --> 03:36.959
than helium,

03:37.000 --> 03:39.125
giving us enough lift and time

03:39.166 --> 03:41.041
to return to

03:39.166 --> 03:41.041
the waters of Maine.

03:41.083 --> 03:43.083
Will the dome stay up

03:41.083 --> 03:43.083
long enough for that?

03:43.125 --> 03:45.583
With our back-up batteries,

03:43.125 --> 03:45.583
yes.

03:45.625 --> 03:48.750
Sounds like our only option.

03:45.625 --> 03:48.750
Let's roll, team.

04:13.291 --> 04:15.625
( hisses )

04:20.750 --> 04:24.000
Chief, Dr. Greene says this is

04:20.750 --> 04:24.000
the last of the floatium.

04:24.041 --> 04:27.041
Here goes.

04:24.041 --> 04:27.041
Think light thoughts.

04:27.083 --> 04:29.583
( hisses )

04:29.625 --> 04:32.125
Oh. Oh. Oh!

04:32.166 --> 04:34.625
( coughs )

04:34.667 --> 04:36.083
( sniffs )

04:36.125 --> 04:39.375
The floatium works okay.

04:39.417 --> 04:41.250
( rumbling )

04:41.291 --> 04:43.917
( all exclaim )

05:07.166 --> 05:10.959
How long are those humans

05:07.166 --> 05:10.959
gonna be dripping on my deck?

05:11.000 --> 05:13.166
Until we have a better plan.

05:13.208 --> 05:15.417
We can't just sit around.

05:13.208 --> 05:15.417
We should be doing something.

05:15.458 --> 05:17.083
( cell phone rings )

05:17.125 --> 05:18.333
Charlie.

05:18.375 --> 05:20.875
Woodrow, we finally got

05:18.375 --> 05:20.875
phone reception.

05:20.917 --> 05:22.083
Are you all right?

05:22.125 --> 05:24.041
Uhh, fine now,

05:24.083 --> 05:26.041
thanks to your new

05:24.083 --> 05:26.041
Rescue Bot recruits.

05:26.083 --> 05:28.375
But how and where are you?

05:28.417 --> 05:31.792
Don't worry. We're safe.

05:28.417 --> 05:31.792
And Griffin Rock is flying home.

05:31.834 --> 05:33.834
It's a long story.

05:33.875 --> 05:35.667
Anything we can do

05:33.875 --> 05:35.667
to help?

05:35.709 --> 05:37.166
You can check the sea floor.

05:37.208 --> 05:39.375
Doc says when we land,

05:37.208 --> 05:39.375
we have to line up perfectly

05:39.417 --> 05:42.166
with the hole we left,

05:39.417 --> 05:42.166
or the island could break apart.

05:42.208 --> 05:45.041
Finally,

05:42.208 --> 05:45.041
something to do.

05:47.792 --> 05:51.417
Did high-octane brain forget who

05:47.792 --> 05:51.417
the submersible is around here?

05:51.458 --> 05:54.000
Woody, you're in charge

05:51.458 --> 05:54.000
while I'm gone.

05:54.041 --> 05:55.709
Take care of everyone.

05:55.750 --> 05:58.000
You can count on me, big bro.

05:58.041 --> 06:01.333
Uh, guys, you should

05:58.041 --> 06:01.333
probably see this.

06:01.375 --> 06:03.959
It'll take days to clear.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.250
Well, at least now

06:04.000 --> 06:07.250
you have lots to do, Blurr.

06:07.291 --> 06:09.875
Not what I had in mind.

06:09.917 --> 06:11.917
( vocalizes )

06:13.208 --> 06:15.375
Well, we owe you one, Doc.

06:15.417 --> 06:17.792
Your floatium

06:15.417 --> 06:17.792
is a real lifesaver.

06:17.834 --> 06:19.917
Uh, something wrong, Doc?

06:19.959 --> 06:23.375
I just realized, in all

06:19.959 --> 06:23.375
our unexpected travel,

06:23.417 --> 06:26.125
I never proposed to Anna.

06:26.166 --> 06:28.291
Perhaps I should wait

06:26.166 --> 06:28.291
for a better time.

06:28.333 --> 06:30.750
Dad, there's only

06:28.333 --> 06:30.750
one good time

06:30.792 --> 06:32.375
to tell someone how much

06:30.792 --> 06:32.375
you care about them--

06:32.417 --> 06:34.208
now.

06:34.250 --> 06:37.917
Spoken from the heart,

06:34.250 --> 06:37.917
my little cardiologist.

06:37.959 --> 06:41.333
I'll go ask her to marry me

06:37.959 --> 06:41.333
right this instant.

06:43.959 --> 06:45.917
( ringtone plays )

06:45.959 --> 06:48.333
Griffin Rock emergency.

06:45.959 --> 06:48.333
Hi, Mr. Pfeiffer.

06:48.375 --> 06:51.750
I'll tell my dad. Stay inside.

06:51.792 --> 06:53.834
A huge hole just opened

06:51.792 --> 06:53.834
in the ground

06:53.875 --> 06:55.375
next to Mr. Pfeiffer's shop.

06:55.417 --> 06:58.417
It's so deep, he says he can

06:55.417 --> 06:58.417
see the sky through it.

06:58.458 --> 07:02.917
No end to the emergencies, team.

06:58.458 --> 07:02.917
Meet me at the bakery.

07:05.208 --> 07:08.166
This island was never meant

07:05.208 --> 07:08.166
to fly, Dad.

07:08.208 --> 07:09.917
Without solid earth

07:08.208 --> 07:09.917
to support it,

07:09.959 --> 07:11.917
the underground tunnels

07:09.959 --> 07:11.917
are crumbling.

07:11.959 --> 07:14.333
And if anyone's standing

07:11.959 --> 07:14.333
above them when they do...

07:14.375 --> 07:16.792
Let's hope they're wearing

07:14.375 --> 07:16.792
a jetpack.

07:16.834 --> 07:18.375
I've pinpointed the locations

07:18.417 --> 07:21.417
of the most

07:18.417 --> 07:21.417
unstable places here.

07:21.458 --> 07:23.959
That's Professor Baranova's

07:21.458 --> 07:23.959
house.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.917
Doc just went there.

07:25.959 --> 07:28.500
Team, clear people out of the

07:25.959 --> 07:28.500
areas on Boulder's map. Hurry.

07:28.542 --> 07:30.500
Come on, Doc, pick up.

07:30.542 --> 07:34.166
( vibrates )

07:36.291 --> 07:38.250
Oh, careful, Ezra.

07:38.291 --> 07:41.375
I almost de-iced you

07:38.291 --> 07:41.375
along with my azaleas.

07:41.417 --> 07:45.125
Anna, will you marry me?

07:45.166 --> 07:47.208
( rumbling )

07:47.250 --> 07:48.208
( both scream )

07:48.250 --> 07:50.208
Anna!

07:48.250 --> 07:50.208
Ezra!

07:52.792 --> 07:53.875
( Ezra screams )

07:53.917 --> 07:55.291
Grab on, Ezra.

07:58.375 --> 08:01.125
( siren wails )

08:01.166 --> 08:03.083
Doc, Professor.

08:03.125 --> 08:04.375
DOC GREENE: We're down here.

08:04.417 --> 08:06.208
Excellent timing.

08:06.250 --> 08:08.375
Chase, help me pull them up.

08:14.959 --> 08:16.959
Thank you, Charlie.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.417
( sighs ) I should've realized

08:19.458 --> 08:22.500
flight could make

08:19.458 --> 08:22.500
parts of the island unstable.

08:22.542 --> 08:25.125
We should fill

08:22.542 --> 08:25.125
the sinkholes with foam

08:25.166 --> 08:27.125
to prevent

08:25.166 --> 08:27.125
floatium leakage and--

08:27.166 --> 08:29.333
Ezra, yes.

08:29.375 --> 08:31.375
I'm glad you agree.

08:31.417 --> 08:33.959
Now, we should head back

08:31.417 --> 08:33.959
to the lab and--

08:34.000 --> 08:36.500
Uh, Doc, she said yes.

08:36.542 --> 08:38.250
It appears the professor

08:38.291 --> 08:40.875
accepts your

08:38.291 --> 08:40.875
matrimonial proposal.

08:40.917 --> 08:43.125
You-You mean...

08:43.166 --> 08:46.208
you do? You will?

08:46.250 --> 08:48.333
It's the only

08:46.250 --> 08:48.333
logical answer.

08:48.375 --> 08:51.917
I'm surprised it took you

08:48.375 --> 08:51.917
so long to arrive at it.

08:51.959 --> 08:56.166
Ahh, yes.

08:51.959 --> 08:56.166
Way to go, Daddy.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.875
( rumbling )

08:59.917 --> 09:01.875
An earthquake in the air?

09:01.917 --> 09:06.041
Worse. It appears something

09:01.917 --> 09:06.041
is wrong with the dome.

09:06.083 --> 09:07.208
( sizzling )

09:07.250 --> 09:09.208
Dad, a new sinkhole

09:07.250 --> 09:09.208
just opened up

09:09.250 --> 09:11.333
near one of

09:09.250 --> 09:11.333
the dome generators.

09:11.375 --> 09:12.583
( Boulder strains )

09:12.625 --> 09:14.333
It's about to lose

09:12.625 --> 09:14.333
it's power source.

09:14.375 --> 09:18.083
( strains )

09:26.458 --> 09:27.709
( rumbling; screaming )

09:33.959 --> 09:34.917
Ow.

09:34.959 --> 09:36.625
Dad, what's happening?

09:36.667 --> 09:39.458
The dome is losing floatium

09:36.667 --> 09:39.458
like a leaky balloon.

09:39.500 --> 09:41.417
Graham, get that generator

09:39.500 --> 09:41.417
working again.

09:41.458 --> 09:44.583
Everyone else,

09:41.458 --> 09:44.583
keep the townsfolk safe.

09:44.625 --> 09:46.375
Easier said than done.

09:48.709 --> 09:50.583
( panting )

09:50.625 --> 09:52.375
( strains )

09:56.291 --> 10:00.542
Okay, attach

09:56.291 --> 10:00.542
the batteries, buddy.

10:00.583 --> 10:03.542
( generator powers up )

10:06.625 --> 10:09.166
Dad, we got the dome

10:06.625 --> 10:09.166
working,

10:09.208 --> 10:11.041
but I'm not sure

10:09.208 --> 10:11.041
for how long.

10:11.083 --> 10:12.959
Back to the firehouse, team.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
Something tells me it's time

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
to think up a plan "C."

10:16.041 --> 10:19.709
"D" might not be

10:16.041 --> 10:19.709
a bad idea, either.

10:19.750 --> 10:21.458
By my calculations,

10:21.500 --> 10:24.625
Griffin Rock is about

10:21.500 --> 10:24.625
an hour away from home.

10:24.667 --> 10:27.166
The bad news is

10:24.667 --> 10:27.166
we're running out of power

10:27.208 --> 10:28.375
to keep the dome up.

10:28.417 --> 10:30.250
Okay, so what's

10:28.417 --> 10:30.250
the good news?

10:30.291 --> 10:31.667
There really isn't any.

10:31.709 --> 10:34.083
Bro, never say

10:31.709 --> 10:34.083
"the bad news is"

10:34.125 --> 10:36.709
without giving good news.

10:34.125 --> 10:36.709
Don't you know what?!

10:36.750 --> 10:39.333
I thought you said we had enough

10:36.750 --> 10:39.333
power to get home, Doc.

10:39.375 --> 10:42.709
That was before the sinkhole

10:39.375 --> 10:42.709
took out the dome generator.

10:42.750 --> 10:46.083
We used all our remaining

10:42.750 --> 10:46.083
batteries to replace it.

10:46.125 --> 10:48.709
But there are plenty of other

10:46.125 --> 10:48.709
energy sources on Griffin Rock.

10:48.750 --> 10:52.000
Yeah, the wind farm,

10:48.750 --> 10:52.000
the water turbines.

10:52.041 --> 10:53.208
Can't we use those?

10:53.250 --> 10:55.542
They require wind

10:53.250 --> 10:55.542
and flowing water,

10:55.583 --> 10:57.583
two things a domed

10:55.583 --> 10:57.583
floating island

10:57.625 --> 10:59.083
is quite without.

10:59.125 --> 11:01.583
But what we do have

10:59.125 --> 11:01.583
is plenty of humans.

11:01.625 --> 11:05.125
Do not remind me. So many

11:01.625 --> 11:05.125
look to us for protection,

11:05.166 --> 11:08.083
yet we may fail them

11:05.166 --> 11:08.083
in this hour of need.

11:08.125 --> 11:11.000
No, Chase. I mean the humans

11:08.125 --> 11:11.000
can turn the turbines.

11:11.041 --> 11:14.166
We'll all work together

11:11.041 --> 11:14.166
to make power.

11:14.208 --> 11:16.667
When our ancestors

11:14.208 --> 11:16.667
arrived on Griffin Rock,

11:16.709 --> 11:19.375
they knew there were

11:16.709 --> 11:19.375
challenges ahead,

11:19.417 --> 11:23.166
but they survived,

11:19.417 --> 11:23.166
and they thrived.

11:23.208 --> 11:26.709
Right now, our island faces

11:23.208 --> 11:26.709
its greatest threat yet,

11:26.750 --> 11:28.417
which is saying something,

11:28.458 --> 11:30.375
but I'm not worried.

11:30.417 --> 11:32.291
Technology may have failed us,

11:32.333 --> 11:35.250
but our greatest resource

11:32.333 --> 11:35.250
never was tech.

11:35.291 --> 11:39.583
It's all of you, and today,

11:35.291 --> 11:39.583
our survival depends on that.

11:39.625 --> 11:41.375
We need to make enough power

11:41.417 --> 11:43.583
to keep those

11:41.417 --> 11:43.583
dome generators running.

11:43.625 --> 11:47.041
It'll take everything we've got,

11:43.625 --> 11:47.041
and it won't be easy.

11:47.083 --> 11:48.667
Can I count on you?

11:48.709 --> 11:51.583
( all yell in agreement )

12:10.125 --> 12:11.875
( generators power up )

12:43.291 --> 12:44.834
( strains )

12:44.875 --> 12:47.625
Come on, you hunk of scrap.

12:47.667 --> 12:53.625
Nobody makes Blurr look bad.

12:53.667 --> 12:56.583
Oh, yeah. That's what I thought.

12:56.625 --> 12:58.875
Yeah, Blurr is in the hou--

12:56.625 --> 12:58.875
Hey, Optimus.

12:58.917 --> 13:01.125
Uh, when'd you get here?

13:01.166 --> 13:04.208
Just in time. Chief Burns

13:01.166 --> 13:04.208
informs me

13:04.250 --> 13:06.583
the island is nearly here.

13:06.625 --> 13:09.291
Ha ha. Working together.

13:09.333 --> 13:11.291
Just like old times,

13:09.333 --> 13:11.291
eh, O.P.?

13:11.333 --> 13:14.834
And the stakes

13:11.333 --> 13:14.834
are just as high.

13:16.917 --> 13:18.458
Come on, team.

13:18.500 --> 13:21.750
Let's give Charlie

13:18.500 --> 13:21.750
a place to land.

13:23.166 --> 13:26.834
Reactaline. I didn't know

13:23.166 --> 13:26.834
it was down here.

13:26.875 --> 13:28.709
That's powerful stuff.

13:28.750 --> 13:31.333
These rocks are for moving,

13:28.750 --> 13:31.333
not studying.

13:31.375 --> 13:32.917
Hey, Salvage, race you.

13:32.959 --> 13:35.208
You're on.

13:50.875 --> 13:54.208
( snores )

13:54.250 --> 13:56.625
( snores )

13:56.667 --> 13:59.208
( snores )

14:00.834 --> 14:03.166
( snores )

14:03.208 --> 14:06.625
Cody, we're running

14:03.208 --> 14:06.625
out of energy over here.

14:06.667 --> 14:09.250
Here-Here, too.

14:09.291 --> 14:12.208
And the group at the

14:09.291 --> 14:12.208
water turbines already stopped.

14:12.250 --> 14:15.542
( grunting )

14:15.583 --> 14:19.291
The dome's starting to

14:15.583 --> 14:19.291
give out, team.

14:19.333 --> 14:21.250
We have to keep moving.

14:21.291 --> 14:24.250
( engine shuts off )

14:24.291 --> 14:25.333
What was that?

14:25.375 --> 14:27.333
The Sigma's rocket

14:25.375 --> 14:27.333
turning off.

14:27.375 --> 14:29.333
It just ran out of energon.

14:29.375 --> 14:31.375
So, we can't steer now?

14:31.417 --> 14:33.542
Or move. We're stuck here.

14:33.583 --> 14:35.875
We're not stuck,

14:33.583 --> 14:35.875
we're falling.

14:35.917 --> 14:38.375
( all scream )

14:38.417 --> 14:39.750
CHASE: Inconvenient.

14:44.625 --> 14:46.000
We'll fall out of the sky

14:46.041 --> 14:48.166
if we don't get those

14:46.041 --> 14:48.166
windmills moving. Hurry.

14:48.208 --> 14:51.625
( gasping )

14:58.291 --> 15:01.709
Dad, we can't

14:58.291 --> 15:01.709
keep this up much longer.

15:01.750 --> 15:04.041
I know, son, but if we fail,

15:04.083 --> 15:06.917
we'll fail giving it

15:04.083 --> 15:06.917
our best try.

15:06.959 --> 15:09.083
Spoken like a true Rescue Bot.

15:09.125 --> 15:12.333
Chief, we have

15:09.125 --> 15:12.333
an alternate power source.

15:12.375 --> 15:14.583
Energon can buy you time.

15:14.625 --> 15:18.583
No. You can't give us

15:14.625 --> 15:18.583
your energy to keep the dome up.

15:18.625 --> 15:20.083
That would mean...

15:21.250 --> 15:25.166
Cody, you taught us

15:21.250 --> 15:25.166
everything we know about humans,

15:25.208 --> 15:27.750
and that includes

15:25.208 --> 15:27.750
doing whatever you can

15:27.792 --> 15:30.625
to protect those

15:27.792 --> 15:30.625
you care about.

15:30.667 --> 15:32.375
Being a Rescue Bot

15:32.417 --> 15:35.917
is about serving, saving,

15:32.417 --> 15:35.917
and protecting those in need.

15:35.959 --> 15:40.709
That's the what but your family

15:35.959 --> 15:40.709
gave us the reason why.

15:40.750 --> 15:43.125
I can't let you

15:40.750 --> 15:43.125
sacrifice yourselves for us.

15:43.166 --> 15:46.375
With all due respect, sir,

15:43.166 --> 15:46.375
it's not your call.

15:46.417 --> 15:50.166
Rescue Bots,

15:46.417 --> 15:50.166
roll to the rescue.

15:58.709 --> 16:00.291
CHIEF:  Optimus,

15:58.709 --> 16:00.291
we're about a mile away,

16:00.333 --> 16:01.959
but we've lost propulsion.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.375
Is there anything

16:02.000 --> 16:03.375
you can do to help?

16:03.417 --> 16:07.333
Chief Burns,

16:03.417 --> 16:07.333
help is rolling out.

16:15.041 --> 16:18.709
OPTIMUS: High Tide, make sure

16:15.041 --> 16:18.709
the sea floor is clear

16:18.750 --> 16:20.709
for our return.

16:23.041 --> 16:24.792
( all gasp )

16:26.959 --> 16:29.333
When did we get

16:26.959 --> 16:29.333
that robot?

16:29.375 --> 16:32.458
I just can't keep track

16:29.375 --> 16:32.458
of them all anymore.

16:34.375 --> 16:37.667
Almost home, Heatwave.

16:34.375 --> 16:37.667
Just hang in there.

16:37.709 --> 16:42.417
Just remember--you're gonna

16:37.709 --> 16:42.417
owe me big for this.

16:42.458 --> 16:44.125
( grunts )

16:44.166 --> 16:45.875
Heatwave? Heatwave.

16:45.917 --> 16:48.417
Dad, the bots can't take

16:45.917 --> 16:48.417
much more of this.

16:48.458 --> 16:50.041
They're getting too weak.

16:50.083 --> 16:52.709
I know, son, but we have to

16:50.083 --> 16:52.709
respect their choice.

16:55.083 --> 16:56.709
As much as we hate it.

16:56.750 --> 16:58.792
( grunts and gasps )

17:01.208 --> 17:03.250
Buddy, you okay?

17:07.291 --> 17:09.041
Cody, how close are we?

17:09.083 --> 17:10.333
Nearly there.

17:17.417 --> 17:20.458
Well, salt my flounder

17:17.417 --> 17:20.458
and call me matey.

17:20.500 --> 17:24.458
Land ho.

17:24.500 --> 17:29.875
Family, magnetize

17:24.500 --> 17:29.875
the reactaline in 3, 2, 1.

17:29.917 --> 17:32.333
Now.

17:36.959 --> 17:40.375
Quickly, release your towlines

17:36.959 --> 17:40.375
and scatter.

17:51.959 --> 17:56.208
Heatwave? Come on,

17:51.959 --> 17:56.208
you bucket of bolts. Wake up.

17:56.250 --> 17:59.125
What's the point

17:56.250 --> 17:59.125
of saving our home

17:59.166 --> 18:01.792
if you're not

17:59.166 --> 18:01.792
gonna be here anymore?

18:01.834 --> 18:05.375
You would've done

18:01.834 --> 18:05.375
the same for him, Kade.

18:09.834 --> 18:12.458
Our medic has seen to

18:09.834 --> 18:12.458
the Rescue Bots

18:12.500 --> 18:16.458
and given them several

18:12.500 --> 18:16.458
energon transfusions.

18:16.500 --> 18:18.000
Are they going to be okay?

18:18.041 --> 18:20.417
HEATWAVE:

18:18.041 --> 18:20.417
About time you showed up.

18:20.458 --> 18:22.959
Noble.

18:23.000 --> 18:26.458
Chase decided to entertain us

18:23.000 --> 18:26.458
while we were recovering

18:26.500 --> 18:28.875
by reading us police manuals.

18:28.917 --> 18:30.417
With footnotes.

18:30.458 --> 18:33.375
In all of Earth's languages.

18:33.417 --> 18:36.083
Did you know there are

18:33.417 --> 18:36.083
similar laws in every culture?

18:36.125 --> 18:39.458
Mankind truly is

18:36.125 --> 18:39.458
a fascinating species.

18:39.500 --> 18:41.792
You're okay.

18:39.500 --> 18:41.792
Good to see you, partner.

18:41.834 --> 18:43.542
I missed you so much, Blades.

18:41.834 --> 18:43.542
Don't scare us like that again.

18:43.583 --> 18:45.250
Welcome home.

18:43.583 --> 18:45.250
Okay, buddy?

18:45.291 --> 18:47.917
Huh, maybe Optimus

18:45.291 --> 18:47.917
is on to something

18:47.959 --> 18:50.375
with the whole humans and bots

18:47.959 --> 18:50.375
working together thing.

18:50.417 --> 18:54.500
For a race car,

18:50.417 --> 18:54.500
sometimes you're pretty slow.

18:54.542 --> 18:56.500
Thanks for the save

18:54.542 --> 18:56.500
back there, Woody.

18:56.542 --> 18:59.000
When did you get so good

18:56.542 --> 18:59.000
at rescue work?

18:59.041 --> 19:00.959
Ha ha. I learned

18:59.041 --> 19:00.959
everything I know

19:01.000 --> 19:04.917
from my big brother,

19:01.000 --> 19:04.917
including this.

19:04.959 --> 19:06.875
Hey.

19:04.959 --> 19:06.875
Ha ha ha ha.

19:08.583 --> 19:10.959
All right, team,

19:08.583 --> 19:10.959
meet me outside.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.834
We're ready to close up

19:11.000 --> 19:12.834
this new time capsule

19:12.875 --> 19:14.250
and get her buried.

19:14.291 --> 19:18.000
Did Chief ever decide

19:14.291 --> 19:18.000
what to put into that thing?

19:18.041 --> 19:20.959
He didn't have to.

19:18.041 --> 19:20.959
After the island landed,

19:21.000 --> 19:23.166
people thought about what was

19:21.000 --> 19:23.166
really important to them,

19:23.208 --> 19:26.041
and that's what

19:23.208 --> 19:26.041
they want to preserve.

19:28.875 --> 19:30.583
Wait. Don't close it yet.

19:30.625 --> 19:34.000
I have something

19:30.625 --> 19:34.000
I want to put inside.

19:34.041 --> 19:36.166
The video you and Cody made?

19:36.208 --> 19:38.542
Don't you have to

19:36.208 --> 19:38.542
edit us out of that first?

19:38.583 --> 19:42.083
Actually, we were thinking we'd

19:38.583 --> 19:42.083
like to leave it like it is.

19:42.125 --> 19:44.041
We want everyone to know

19:42.125 --> 19:44.041
who you are

19:44.083 --> 19:45.583
and what you did to save us.

19:45.625 --> 19:49.208
Yeah. Hopefully

19:45.625 --> 19:49.208
in another 75 years,

19:49.250 --> 19:51.875
people will be able to accept

19:49.250 --> 19:51.875
aliens living among them.

19:51.917 --> 19:53.250
But--

19:53.291 --> 19:55.583
That has been my goal

19:53.291 --> 19:55.583
as well, Francine,

19:55.625 --> 19:59.875
and Griffin Rock has been

19:55.625 --> 19:59.875
an excellent testing ground.

19:59.917 --> 20:01.917
But won't humans

19:59.917 --> 20:01.917
be afraid of us?

20:03.959 --> 20:06.041
Not if your actions are true.

20:06.083 --> 20:08.083
You may look different,

20:08.125 --> 20:11.875
but you are fully a part

20:08.125 --> 20:11.875
of the Burns family.

20:11.917 --> 20:16.875
They are in your spark,

20:11.917 --> 20:16.875
and you are in their hearts.

20:16.917 --> 20:19.500
That capacity for friendship

20:19.542 --> 20:23.625
is what defines humans

20:19.542 --> 20:23.625
and Autobots.

20:23.667 --> 20:26.583
Sir, does this mean

20:23.667 --> 20:26.583
our orders have changed?

20:26.625 --> 20:29.166
We can be ourselves

20:26.625 --> 20:29.166
around humans?

20:29.208 --> 20:30.375
We don't have to...

20:30.417 --> 20:32.500
( robotic ) talk...like...this?

20:32.542 --> 20:35.917
Let us start with

20:32.542 --> 20:35.917
this island and see.

20:35.959 --> 20:40.166
Heatwave, you are

20:35.959 --> 20:40.166
this team's leader.

20:40.208 --> 20:43.083
Do you accept this new mission?

20:43.125 --> 20:46.417
Optimus, there's only

20:43.125 --> 20:46.417
one answer for that.

20:46.458 --> 20:49.709
Rescue Bots,

20:46.458 --> 20:49.709
roll to the rescue.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.500
( sirens wailing )
