Signed False Face."

00:27.592 --> 00:28.691
Yes, he's back again.

00:28.693 --> 00:33.262
That infamous criminal
master of trickery and disguise.

00:37.969 --> 00:40.136
I am the Princess Mergenberg.

00:40.138 --> 00:43.005
What is this I hear?
My crown will be stolen?

00:43.007 --> 00:45.574
Oh, we'll keep it safe for you,
Your Highness.

00:45.576 --> 00:49.045
Oh, is so?
Then what is this?

00:49.047 --> 00:51.981
"All that glitters is gone."

00:51.983 --> 00:54.583
Shouldn't that be,

Oh, that's the trademark

00:58.323 --> 01:02.158
'But the crown
is here and safe.'

01:02.160 --> 01:05.161
Not quite, Chief O'Hara

01:09.968 --> 01:11.200
It's False Face.

01:11.202 --> 01:13.970
In disguised person.

01:21.312 --> 01:23.112
Stop! Thief.

01:29.287 --> 01:33.923

02:27.245 --> 02:31.581
Uh, so False Face is back
and up to his old tricks, eh?

02:31.583 --> 02:33.049
Disguised as
a Princess Mergenberg

02:33.051 --> 02:35.318
he and his accomplice
the beautiful Blaze

02:35.320 --> 02:36.919
tried for the crown.

02:36.921 --> 02:39.255
And failed.

02:43.161 --> 02:44.694
A false top.

Plastic

02:46.631 --> 02:48.598
The crown.

02:49.668 --> 02:51.334
phony.

02:51.336 --> 02:52.335
Utterly worthless.

02:52.337 --> 02:55.705
False Face has struck
deviously and ruthlessly.

02:55.707 --> 02:58.575
Can't we stop this master
of devilish disguises?

02:58.577 --> 03:02.278
Commissioner, there's
only one man living

03:02.280 --> 03:04.747
who can unmask False Face.

03:06.017 --> 03:08.217
Chief O'Hara, you've said
it for all of us.

03:08.219 --> 03:12.021
Our only hope is that towering
power for right and justice

03:12.023 --> 03:14.857
the Caped Crusader.

03:32.944 --> 03:36.045
I'll call him, sir.

03:41.987 --> 03:43.319
Pine.

03:44.823 --> 03:46.956
Elm.

03:46.958 --> 03:49.125
Hickory.

03:49.127 --> 03:50.026
Gosh, botany is tough.

03:50.028 --> 03:53.329
I'll never learn to recognize
all these trees.

03:53.331 --> 03:54.364
Come, come, Dick.

03:54.366 --> 03:57.800
Pine, elm, hickory,
chestnut, maple..

03:57.802 --> 04:02.105
part of our heritage
is the more of living things.

04:02.107 --> 04:03.973
The story book of nature.

04:03.975 --> 04:04.841
That's true, Bruce.

04:04.943 --> 04:07.276
I'll learn to read
that book of nature, yes.

04:07.278 --> 04:09.779
Begging your pardon, sir.
It's the Bat-phone.

04:09.781 --> 04:10.947
Jiminy.
What are we waiting for?

04:10.949 --> 04:14.115
Oh, Dick, I found
one of your specimens.

04:14.117 --> 04:17.452
Thanks a million, Aunt Harriet,
but we were just going to, uh..

04:17.454 --> 04:20.022
Uh, ramble in the woods,
Aunt Harriet.

so to speak.

Yes, commissioner.

Crooked but king size.

06:23.082 --> 06:25.349
All too true, Boy Wonder.

06:25.485 --> 06:27.785
Messenger here for Batman.

06:27.787 --> 06:30.655
Alright, are you Batman, sunny?

06:30.657 --> 06:32.390
I am.

06:40.566 --> 06:41.565
"I intend to give money

06:41.567 --> 06:45.703
"to a defenseless little girl,
signed, F. F."

06:47.340 --> 06:50.340
I'd wager that's
some sort of a code.

06:50.342 --> 06:54.611
It is. False Face always says,
the opposite of what he means.

06:54.613 --> 06:58.515
Then I intend to give money
means, he intends to take money.

06:58.517 --> 07:01.252
But what defenseless
little girl?

07:01.254 --> 07:02.219
Confusing, eh, sunny?

07:02.221 --> 07:06.790
Not really. The victim is
neither little nor a girl

07:06.792 --> 07:09.059
nor defenseless.

07:09.562 --> 07:12.263
Opposite of girl's a boy.

07:12.265 --> 07:15.032
The opposite of defenseless..

07:15.034 --> 07:17.234
Say, wearing armor?

07:17.236 --> 07:18.802
That's it.
Of course.

07:18.804 --> 07:20.170
The Ladd Armored Car Company

07:20.172 --> 07:23.107
Holy bouncing boiler plated,
it fits.

07:23.109 --> 07:24.875
Ladd as in boy.

07:24.877 --> 07:26.710
Armored for defense.

07:26.712 --> 07:29.046
A big truck full of money.

07:29.048 --> 07:30.981
That's it,
You've got it.

07:30.983 --> 07:34.251
I have more than that.

07:42.028 --> 07:45.629
Unless I miss my gaze,
you are..

07:46.299 --> 07:46.931
Blaze.

07:46.933 --> 07:51.602
False Face's trusted assistant
at your service.

07:51.604 --> 07:55.172
You've got quite a grip there,
Caped Crusader.

07:55.174 --> 07:56.874
Sound mind in a sound body.

07:56.876 --> 07:59.276
A necessity in the relentless
war against crime

07:59.278 --> 08:04.715
And speaking of crime,
why'd False Face send you here?

08:05.885 --> 08:07.117
False Face, challenges you

08:07.119 --> 08:09.753
'to prove that
he's committed a crime.'

08:09.755 --> 08:13.958
And if you do, to catch him.

08:13.960 --> 08:15.826
And me.

08:33.679 --> 08:34.878
It's too late.

08:34.880 --> 08:38.015
Blaze. She's as elusive
as a flickering flame.

08:38.017 --> 08:40.183
I bet that's how she
earned her nick name.

08:40.186 --> 08:43.886
I warrant, she'll snuff
out her fiery criminal career.

08:43.889 --> 08:47.691
To the Ladd Armored Car Company,
let's go.

08:57.837 --> 08:58.736
Are you all assembled?

08:58.738 --> 09:02.039
The counterfeit crew ready
and on duty, False Face.

09:02.041 --> 09:02.673
Good!

09:02.675 --> 09:09.813
First, men, I succeeded
in lifting the Mergenberg crown.

09:09.815 --> 09:11.715
You've done it again, FF.

09:11.717 --> 09:14.151
Only the beginning.

09:14.153 --> 09:17.154
Blaze, my trusted
assistant..

09:17.156 --> 09:22.092
...has succeeded in starting
of step two of my overall plan.

09:22.094 --> 09:25.129
Boys, we are about
to double-dizzy Batman and Robin

09:25.131 --> 09:28.298
until the Dexterous Duo
is duped, decoyed

09:28.300 --> 09:30.100
and diabolically destroyed!

09:30.102 --> 09:32.903
I've planned
the greatest creation

09:32.905 --> 09:35.673
of my covert criminal career.

09:35.808 --> 09:37.941
False Face will stamp
his disguise

09:37.943 --> 09:39.677
imaged on all Gotham City.

09:39.679 --> 09:42.880
Today Gotham City,
tomorrow the world.

09:42.882 --> 09:44.715
Three cheers for F. F.

09:44.717 --> 09:48.218
Hurray! Hurray! Hurray!

09:48.354 --> 09:49.386
Thanks, men.

09:49.388 --> 09:51.355
I know you didn't mean.

09:51.357 --> 09:52.990
But back to business.

09:52.992 --> 09:55.426
Batman and Robin must go.

09:57.063 --> 09:59.129
Batman and Robin,
why it isn't often

09:59.131 --> 10:01.331
that a simple business man's
honored by a visit

10:01.333 --> 10:04.368
from the champion of justice
and his youthful associate.

10:04.370 --> 10:05.235
How can I help you?

10:05.237 --> 10:08.005
Rather it's we who can help you,
Mr. Ladd.

10:08.007 --> 10:08.906
We have reason to believe

10:08.908 --> 10:11.975
that one of your armored trucks
maybe in danger.

10:11.977 --> 10:12.476
Good heavens.

10:12.478 --> 10:15.179
I've received word that
one of my trucks is late.

10:15.181 --> 10:17.815
And it's due at the
Gotham City National Bank

10:17.817 --> 10:19.817
to pick up a huge shipment
of money.

10:19.819 --> 10:21.452
I wouldn't be surprised
if False Face

10:21.454 --> 10:23.387
with his spoke in
that set of wheels.

10:23.389 --> 10:25.389
- Right.
- May I use your telephone?

10:25.391 --> 10:27.357
'Oh, yes, of course.'

10:35.067 --> 10:38.969
Commissioner Gordon, please.
This is Batman speaking.

10:38.971 --> 10:41.305
Commissioner,
There's no time to explain.

10:41.307 --> 10:43.307
Dispatch as many spare men
as possible

10:43.309 --> 10:47.277
to Gotham City National Bank
immediately.

10:47.279 --> 10:49.913
Mr. Ladd, we'll keep you
informed and let you know

10:49.915 --> 10:53.083
just as soon as your missing
money truck is found.

10:53.085 --> 10:54.017
Bless you, Batman.

10:54.019 --> 10:56.086
Every law abiding citizen
of Gotham City

10:56.088 --> 10:57.354
goes with you today in spirit.

10:57.356 --> 11:00.991
And if it were possible,
<i> in body.</i>

11:10.069 --> 11:12.269
Batman and Robin.

11:12.271 --> 11:13.237
Come to make a deposit?

11:13.239 --> 11:16.073
No, we've come to prevent
a withdrawal.

11:16.075 --> 11:16.774
By False Face.

11:16.776 --> 11:19.476
What? False Face,
notorious criminal?

11:19.478 --> 11:20.344
Master of disguise?

11:20.346 --> 11:24.481
We better put the money in the
truck before it's too late, pal.

11:24.483 --> 11:25.916
It's already too late.

11:25.918 --> 11:27.551
- False Face!
- What?

11:27.553 --> 11:31.522
Right, that's False Face
himself in disguised person.

11:31.524 --> 11:33.924
Yeah, what makes you so sure?

11:33.926 --> 11:34.491
If's obvious.

11:34.493 --> 11:36.827
Only a criminal would
disguise himself

11:36.829 --> 11:38.128
as licensed bonded guard

11:38.130 --> 11:42.533
yet callously park in front
of a fire hydrant.

11:52.244 --> 11:53.944
It's always the little things.

11:53.946 --> 11:57.514
This time it'll cost you
a big penalty, False Face.

11:57.516 --> 11:59.983
We're going to withdraw
you from circulation

11:59.985 --> 12:01.985
and <i> deposit</i> you in jail.

12:01.987 --> 12:06.156
Well, Boy Wonder, you're
interest is over due.

12:40.059 --> 12:41.992
Thank you, Batman..

12:42.361 --> 12:46.063
...for breaking into my trap.

13:08.454 --> 13:11.955
Batman, it's Blaze
in the Batmobile.

13:13.392 --> 13:15.792
Ugh! Oh, you're so strong.

13:15.794 --> 13:18.095
I urge you to abandon
this life of crime, Blaze

13:18.097 --> 13:19.630
before it's too late.

13:19.632 --> 13:22.967
It's already too late, Batman.

13:36.015 --> 13:36.714
Holy Houdini!

13:36.716 --> 13:41.118
Another deft escape by that
master of disguise and deceit.

13:41.120 --> 13:43.787
But where can False Face be?

14:10.316 --> 14:12.016
Saint's alive!

14:12.018 --> 14:12.950
It's False Face.

14:12.952 --> 14:14.818
Disguised as me self.

14:14.820 --> 14:16.387
Right you are, O'Hara.

14:16.389 --> 14:19.356
Welcome, to dreamland.

14:34.941 --> 14:37.308
Alright, take off.

14:40.680 --> 14:42.846
Everything's under control,
chief.

14:42.848 --> 14:44.782
Good work.

15:01.068 --> 15:04.302
This paper that False Face
used to print his message

15:04.304 --> 15:05.937
it's rather special.

15:05.939 --> 15:08.373
Tensile resistance 85.

15:08.375 --> 15:09.240
Holy armored plate.

15:09.242 --> 15:11.610
This' about the strongest stuff
I've ever seen.

15:11.612 --> 15:13.412
As I suspected.

15:13.414 --> 15:16.715
86, 87..

15:16.917 --> 15:20.685
87.6, I can't figure
it out, Batman.

15:20.687 --> 15:23.054
I think a little session
with a Bat-analyst

15:23.056 --> 15:26.791
might clarify things, Robin.

15:26.793 --> 15:29.060
Uh, I-I seem to be
short of cash.

15:29.062 --> 15:30.929
Alfred, have you a dollar bill?

15:30.931 --> 15:32.664
Certainly, sir.

15:32.666 --> 15:35.133
- There.
- Thank you.

15:40.040 --> 15:43.174
By focusing
ultraviolet light

15:43.176 --> 15:44.342
and applying the principles

15:44.344 --> 15:47.278
of controlled fluorescent
diffraction

15:47.280 --> 15:48.213
we can readily discern..

15:48.215 --> 15:49.648
Why False Face
printed his message

15:49.650 --> 15:52.784
on the same kind of paper
they used to make money.

15:52.786 --> 15:54.819
But what use could
he make of that paper?

15:54.821 --> 15:57.422
To make money, his kind
of money, counterfeit money.

15:57.424 --> 16:00.358
Will the man stop
at nothing?

16:02.963 --> 16:06.665
This paper is made by a top
secret government process indeed

16:06.667 --> 16:09.034
only a few people outside
the official bank note

16:09.036 --> 16:12.837
printing company are aware
that it's the only paper

16:12.839 --> 16:15.874
that cannot be counterfeited.

16:17.144 --> 16:17.710
Uh-huh!

16:18.412 --> 16:21.613
- You found something?
- The solution, sir?

16:21.615 --> 16:24.082
The size...the material

16:24.785 --> 16:25.750
it all fits.

16:25.752 --> 16:27.819
This is official
bank note paper.

16:27.821 --> 16:28.887
False Face must have penetrated

16:28.889 --> 16:30.622
the official bank note
printing company.

16:30.624 --> 16:32.023
And if he has plans
of counterfeiting

16:32.025 --> 16:35.093
I'll bet he'll go back
there for more special paper.

16:35.095 --> 16:37.596
But we will be there
before he is.

16:37.598 --> 16:38.563
To the Batmobile.

16:38.565 --> 16:39.865
Alfred, please inform
Mrs. Cooper

16:39.867 --> 16:42.801
that we maybe late
for supper this evening.

16:42.803 --> 16:44.603
Very good, sir.

17:14.435 --> 17:15.666
There's nobody here.

17:15.669 --> 17:17.669
Not so far.

17:17.805 --> 17:18.869
But if someone should arrive

17:18.872 --> 17:22.374
I think we should be
out of sight.

17:45.966 --> 17:48.400
Excuse me, do you have a light?

17:48.402 --> 17:49.901
Why, certainly.

17:49.903 --> 17:54.139
But smoking is forbidden
in the bank note paper room.

17:54.141 --> 17:57.509
What department
are you in, miss?

17:57.511 --> 17:59.044
Removal.

17:59.646 --> 18:04.549
You see, my curious friend,
we need this paper.

18:05.085 --> 18:09.020
Quickly, move this
into the trick truck.

18:12.559 --> 18:14.092
- Hey, Batman.
- And Robin.

18:14.094 --> 18:17.062
We've been found out!

18:21.802 --> 18:22.768
No, you don't, Blaze.

18:22.770 --> 18:25.871
I have the answer
to that little thing.

18:28.809 --> 18:31.042
I knew...sooner or later

18:31.044 --> 18:36.748
you would over come
my bag of tricks.

18:39.586 --> 18:41.987
Let the flat guards
clean up these beauties.

18:41.989 --> 18:44.189
I wanna interrogate, Blaze.

18:44.925 --> 18:46.858
Let me down.

18:57.671 --> 19:00.872
You must excuse Chief O'Hara,
he has an agonizing toothache

19:00.874 --> 19:02.808
and finds it very
difficult to speak.

19:02.810 --> 19:04.509
I can hardly recognize
his voice.

19:04.511 --> 19:07.479
- Mmm.
- I hope it gets better, chief.

19:09.583 --> 19:11.450
She's awakened.

19:12.686 --> 19:17.656
Well, miss, it seems
we've apprehended you.

19:17.658 --> 19:19.624
You? Scarcely.

19:19.626 --> 19:20.692
Batman captured me.

19:20.894 --> 19:25.030
Only the nemesis of crime could
have tripped up Blaze so deftly.

19:25.032 --> 19:28.933
Blaze, we've deduced
False Face's intent

19:28.935 --> 19:29.834
to counterfeit money.

19:29.836 --> 19:33.672
We must know where he intends
to perform the printing.

19:33.674 --> 19:36.741
So, you're in on
the counterfeiting caper.

19:37.944 --> 19:39.444
Very clever, Caped Crusader.

19:39.446 --> 19:42.180
But I know that's only
part of his overall plan.

19:42.182 --> 19:45.784
'We must have details
of complete plot.'

19:45.786 --> 19:47.986
'How? Where? When?'

19:47.988 --> 19:48.920
I don't know.

19:48.922 --> 19:52.323
You? His first lieutenant.

19:52.325 --> 19:53.825
That's pretty dim, Blaze.

19:53.827 --> 19:57.462
False Face trusts no one
and no one trusts False Face.

19:57.464 --> 20:00.832
'Like his name, like his
innumerable disguises.'

20:00.834 --> 20:03.134
He's forever in concealment.

20:03.136 --> 20:05.070
I know he plans
a gigantic coup

20:05.072 --> 20:07.138
but I am not in on his plans.

20:07.140 --> 20:09.908
Then I'm afraid
we're at a dead end.

20:09.910 --> 20:11.209
I'll tell you one thing, Batman

20:11.211 --> 20:13.144
if there's one force
in this world

20:13.146 --> 20:16.414
'that False Face
fears, it's you.'

20:16.416 --> 20:18.283
'And the Boy Wonder of course.'

20:18.285 --> 20:20.085
Many times I've heard
him mutter

20:20.087 --> 20:22.087
"if it were not
for the Caped Crusaders

20:22.089 --> 20:25.857
I would be kingpin
of the criminal class."

20:25.859 --> 20:26.891
That swine.

20:26.893 --> 20:30.929
That False Face is rotten
to his concealed corp.

20:30.931 --> 20:32.030
Please, commissioner.

20:32.032 --> 20:36.000
Even False Face has
a conscience somewhere.

20:36.002 --> 20:38.369
And can be rehabilitated..

20:38.805 --> 20:40.105
...somehow.

20:40.107 --> 20:41.139
Uh, that's so true, Batman.

20:41.141 --> 20:43.808
For a little moment
I was carried away.

20:43.810 --> 20:47.245
Batman, you..
You're truly good.

20:47.247 --> 20:50.782
And if I can, I'll help
you find False Face.

20:54.321 --> 20:58.790
Alright, we'll take a chance
on trusting you, Blaze.

21:00.093 --> 21:03.094
Sorry, I was carried away.

21:03.096 --> 21:06.898
Well, let's all be away,
after False Face.

21:06.900 --> 21:08.166
Right.

21:08.168 --> 21:10.835
If I might make a suggestion.

21:10.837 --> 21:16.174
Why not let the Dynamic Duo
go with Blaze.

21:16.176 --> 21:21.513
While I make certain a force
of picked police standby.

21:21.515 --> 21:23.948
- Capital.
- Good thinking, O'Hara.

21:23.950 --> 21:25.550
It's nothing.

21:25.886 --> 21:28.019
I better be on me way too,
commissioner.

21:28.021 --> 21:30.889
- I wouldn't wanna lose, Batman.
- Right.

21:30.891 --> 21:31.489
<i> Can it be?</i>

21:31.491 --> 21:36.261
<i> Our Batman and Robin rushing</i>
<i> into dire peril.</i>

21:36.263 --> 21:41.800
<i> Does Batman know Chief O'Hara</i>
<i> is False Face?</i>

21:41.802 --> 21:45.403
<i> Can he trust</i>
<i> the treacherous Blaze?</i>

21:46.473 --> 21:47.238
Clever.

21:47.240 --> 21:49.240
Who'd suspect a shutdown
of subway station?

21:49.242 --> 21:52.544
And it's centrally located for
False Face's nefarious plans.

21:52.546 --> 21:55.814
I'm sorry we took so long
to get here, Batman.

21:55.816 --> 21:58.449
But I was unsure of the way.

22:10.463 --> 22:12.430
Where to now?
Time is of the essence.

22:12.432 --> 22:15.433
Oh, good heavens,
no wonder I am starved.

22:15.435 --> 22:16.267
It's after lunch.

22:16.269 --> 22:20.605
Oh, Batman, would you get
me a candy bar, please?

22:20.607 --> 22:21.372
Candy?

22:21.374 --> 22:23.274
Actually fresh fruit
is much more helpful.

22:23.276 --> 22:28.146
Oh, but there's none here.
And there is a candy machine.

22:32.118 --> 22:35.520
He's such a gentlemen,
you both are.

22:35.522 --> 22:37.889
True cavaliers.

22:38.124 --> 22:39.524
Oh!

22:47.400 --> 22:49.500
False Face.

23:01.349 --> 23:03.415
That's quick setting
plastic cement.

23:03.417 --> 23:05.217
Oh, yes, you're strong, Batman.

23:05.219 --> 23:08.087
But a bull elephant
couldn't break these bonds.

23:08.089 --> 23:09.488
False Face, is this killing
necessary?

23:09.490 --> 23:12.158
Absolutely. They must
be disposed off.

23:12.160 --> 23:16.162
The express will be through here
inside of five minutes, Batman.

23:16.164 --> 23:19.632
Inside of six,
no more Batman.

23:19.634 --> 23:20.600
Fiend!

23:20.602 --> 23:23.336
False Face, you'll regret this!

23:23.338 --> 23:24.337
Eventually.

23:24.339 --> 23:25.838
Oh, I regret it already.

23:25.840 --> 23:28.074
False Face, let's reconsider.

23:28.076 --> 23:30.743
Never!

23:30.745 --> 23:32.545
No, you don't!

23:32.547 --> 23:33.613
Come!

23:33.615 --> 23:35.848
Batman, forgive me.

23:35.850 --> 23:36.683
Of course, Blaze.

23:36.685 --> 23:40.453
Any young girl might follow
the wrong impulse.

23:40.455 --> 23:41.988
I forgive you.

23:41.990 --> 23:43.523
Take a last look.

23:43.525 --> 23:45.591
Inside of minutes
the Dynamic Duo

23:45.593 --> 23:47.960
will nearly be
disintegrated debris.

23:51.499 --> 23:53.366
Come on!

23:54.336 --> 23:56.536
<i> Disaster threatens!</i>

23:56.538 --> 23:59.472
<i> Bashed by the BMT?</i>

23:59.474 --> 24:03.409
<i> Will the Dynamic Duo</i>
<i> dice with death</i>

24:03.411 --> 24:05.578
<i> and descend to defeat?</i>

24:05.580 --> 24:09.882
<i> Can Batman and Robin</i>
<i> break the unbreakable</i>

24:09.884 --> 24:13.653
<i> slip out of the</i>
<i> chemical clutches</i>

24:13.655 --> 24:15.355
<i> escape the epoxy?</i>

24:15.357 --> 24:19.392
<i> Keep your Batwings crossed</i>
<i> until tomorrow.</i>

24:19.394 --> 24:20.927
<i> Same time.</i>

24:20.929 --> 24:22.128
<i> Same channel.</i>

24:22.130 --> 24:25.098
<i> Same perilous predicament!</i>
