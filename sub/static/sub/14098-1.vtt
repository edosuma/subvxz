[Jim Jefferies] Thank you.

00:32.746 --> 00:34.248
Oh, my God.

00:34.331 --> 00:35.832
Sit down.

00:35.916 --> 00:37.501
[audience continues cheering]

00:40.128 --> 00:41.255
All right.

00:43.090 --> 00:46.051
Get down, get down.
We got jokes to tell. Come on.

00:46.134 --> 00:47.886
[chuckles]

00:47.970 --> 00:49.930
All right, let's start this shit.

00:53.642 --> 00:55.018
Bill Cosby.

00:55.102 --> 00:56.812
[audience laughing]

00:56.895 --> 01:00.732
Now, I don't know if you
get all the news here in Nashville...

01:02.150 --> 01:03.735
but I may say something

01:03.819 --> 01:06.280
that's very upsetting to many of you.

01:07.197 --> 01:11.493
It turns out that Bill Cosby is a rapist.

01:11.577 --> 01:13.161
[audience laughing]

01:13.245 --> 01:16.039
I know. I always used to watch him
on the telly as a kid,

01:16.123 --> 01:17.708
and I always used to think to myself...

01:17.791 --> 01:21.003
"Ah, I bet he doesn't rape." But...

01:21.086 --> 01:22.796
[audience laughing]

01:24.006 --> 01:28.427
I've been wrong before
and I'll be wrong again,

01:28.510 --> 01:31.805
'cause it turns out
that his favorite thing is rape.

01:32.723 --> 01:35.684
He fucking loves raping people.

01:35.767 --> 01:37.686
Now, think about your favorite thing.

01:37.769 --> 01:41.898
You might be into sports, gardening, golf.
I don't know what the fuck you're into.

01:41.982 --> 01:44.484
Now think about it. Now replace it...

01:45.736 --> 01:46.737
with rape.

01:46.820 --> 01:48.822
[audience laughing]

01:48.905 --> 01:52.242
And that's how Bill Cosby feels
all day, every day.

01:54.828 --> 01:56.496
Now, I did this routine in Australia,

01:56.580 --> 01:58.665
and they wrote a horrible review
of the show.

01:58.749 --> 02:02.419
And I hate that people forget
that I'm a comedian and that I'm joking.

02:02.502 --> 02:05.631
But I have to do
this little public service announcement

02:05.714 --> 02:07.382
before I do this routine.

02:07.466 --> 02:08.842
[breathes deeply]

02:09.759 --> 02:13.221
I believe, in many ways, rape is wrong.

02:13.305 --> 02:15.140
[audience laughing]

02:17.601 --> 02:22.606
I believe, when possible,
you should always avoid raping people.

02:24.066 --> 02:26.026
If you leave the show this evening,

02:26.109 --> 02:28.403
and you're thinking
about raping someone,

02:28.487 --> 02:30.489
Jim Jefferies says no.

02:31.657 --> 02:34.076
[audience cheering and applauding]

02:37.162 --> 02:41.708
But Bill Cosby wouldn't listen to me,
would he? Fuck!

02:41.792 --> 02:44.753
'Cause he fucking loves raping.

02:44.836 --> 02:47.381
Sixty women have come forward.
Sixty women.

02:47.464 --> 02:49.383
It's a big number, isn't it? Sixty.

02:49.466 --> 02:52.094
Actually, a little bit too big.

02:52.177 --> 02:54.471
The real number is 52.

02:54.554 --> 02:57.724
But I can say what I want up here,
so I just rounded it up to 60.

02:57.808 --> 02:59.851
Who gives a fuck, right?

02:59.935 --> 03:04.064
Plus, I'm of the opinion,
after you rape 20, same prison time,

03:04.147 --> 03:06.066
keep raping, I say.

03:07.776 --> 03:09.986
So...

03:10.070 --> 03:13.490
Seventy women have come forward,
all right?

03:14.991 --> 03:17.786
What happened is,
your Whoopi Goldbergs of this world,

03:17.869 --> 03:19.996
when the accusations first came out,

03:20.080 --> 03:22.791
they were like, "Oh, I don't know
if I believe all these women.

03:22.874 --> 03:25.627
They're trying to ruin his legacy,
or some bullshit like that."

03:25.710 --> 03:28.046
'Cause these rapes happened
in the '70s and the '80s, and they said,

03:28.130 --> 03:30.841
"What took these women
so long to come forward?"

03:30.924 --> 03:31.967
It's a good question.

03:32.050 --> 03:34.761
I think it's because,

03:34.845 --> 03:36.930
as rapes go...

03:37.639 --> 03:40.892
they weren't the worst rapes,
now, were they?

03:40.976 --> 03:44.563
He never held them down
and fucking raped them.

03:44.646 --> 03:47.149
He used to drug them
and finger them a bit.

03:47.232 --> 03:51.319
And I've had
worse Christmases with uncles.

03:55.657 --> 03:57.951
What I'm trying to say is this.

03:59.119 --> 04:01.580
If I was ever going to be raped,

04:01.663 --> 04:04.541
I'd like to be raped by Bill Cosby.

04:04.624 --> 04:05.959
[audience laughing]

04:06.793 --> 04:11.047
'Cause I've been such a big fan of his
for so many years,

04:11.131 --> 04:13.508
it would just be wonderful to meet him.

04:13.592 --> 04:17.012
How else would I get to meet him,
you know?

04:17.095 --> 04:20.849
Of course, you know,
we're in the same business.

04:20.932 --> 04:21.975
Comedy.

04:22.058 --> 04:23.393
[audience laughing]

04:25.937 --> 04:26.938
So anyway,

04:27.022 --> 04:29.316
he'd drug the girls' drinks
and they'd pass out.

04:29.399 --> 04:32.778
Now, I don't know
the plight of the attractive female.

04:32.861 --> 04:36.406
I don't know the hell they go through
on a daily basis.

04:36.490 --> 04:37.824
But I do know this.

04:37.908 --> 04:39.576
If someone drugged my drink,

04:39.659 --> 04:41.703
I would take it as a compliment.

04:42.704 --> 04:44.080
I'd be in the bar going,

04:44.164 --> 04:47.459
"I'm getting sleepy.
Who likes me? Who is it?"

04:49.920 --> 04:54.925
So he drugs the drink, and then
you pass out for about four hours,

04:55.008 --> 04:58.428
then you wake up and you're like,
"What the fuck happened?"

04:58.512 --> 05:03.517
And the first thing you would see
is that hysterical face of his.

05:05.602 --> 05:08.355
And he'd have a couple of fingers in you.

05:10.607 --> 05:11.691
And he'd be going...

05:11.775 --> 05:13.318
[imitating Bill Cosby]

05:14.444 --> 05:19.366
"With the fingering, and the drugging,
and the raping and the fingering."

05:21.243 --> 05:24.162
Tell me your first reaction
wouldn't be laughter.

05:25.455 --> 05:28.124
You'd be driving home
before the fingering upset you.

05:28.208 --> 05:32.587
You'd be in your car going,
"Bill Cosby! That was really something!

05:32.671 --> 05:36.550
No, he shouldn't have fingered me.
That was wrong."

05:36.633 --> 05:38.468
Now...

05:38.552 --> 05:41.972
I did that comedy routine, which is...
I was joking just then.

05:42.055 --> 05:43.431
I did that in Australia,

05:43.515 --> 05:48.395
and they wrote a very nasty article
about me with the headline,

05:48.478 --> 05:50.689
"You Cannot Joke About Rape."

05:50.772 --> 05:52.899
- [grunts]
- [audience laughing]

05:55.694 --> 05:57.362
Turns out you can.

05:59.072 --> 06:01.408
I just fucking did it.

06:01.491 --> 06:04.494
And I think we can all agree
that I nailed it.

06:06.413 --> 06:08.456
[audience cheering and applauding]

06:13.545 --> 06:16.798
You can joke about anything.

06:16.881 --> 06:17.924
A joke doesn't mean intent.

06:18.008 --> 06:19.884
It doesn't mean you've actually done it.

06:19.968 --> 06:22.637
What this lady did was
she wrote an article about me,

06:22.721 --> 06:27.225
and she did a transcript
of the actual routine in the article,

06:27.309 --> 06:28.852
wrote down every word I said.

06:28.935 --> 06:29.978
Now, I hate this.

06:30.061 --> 06:32.731
And I'll tell you why.
Because my whole skill in life

06:32.814 --> 06:36.610
is being able to say horrible things
and still seem likable.

06:36.693 --> 06:38.111
[audience laughing]

06:38.194 --> 06:41.323
You take the whole... [grunts] out of it.

06:43.241 --> 06:46.536
See, if you read my material...

06:48.121 --> 06:49.914
it's a bad read.

06:49.998 --> 06:51.124
[audience laughing]

06:54.210 --> 06:57.839
If you just read,
"As rapes go, they weren't..."

06:57.922 --> 06:59.591
"Oh, my God!"

07:03.428 --> 07:06.640
See, then she started to write
and say things like,

07:06.723 --> 07:08.475
"It is Jim Jefferies' opinion

07:08.558 --> 07:11.645
that women should be happy
when they're drugged." Not my opinion.

07:11.728 --> 07:14.522
It was a joke I said, not my opinion.

07:14.606 --> 07:17.692
Not something that I think,
something that I think is funny.

07:17.776 --> 07:19.486
There is a big fucking difference

07:19.569 --> 07:23.698
between things that I think
and things that I think are funny to say.

07:25.659 --> 07:28.745
If you wanna know,
my actual opinion is this.

07:30.080 --> 07:31.915
I don't wanna be raped by Bill Cosby.

07:31.998 --> 07:33.625
[audience laughing]

07:36.086 --> 07:38.964
He's a horrible fucking man
and should go to prison.

07:39.047 --> 07:40.507
That's what my real opinion is.

07:40.590 --> 07:45.178
But if I came out and said that,
you'd go, "Oh, Jim's lost his edge."

07:45.261 --> 07:47.097
[audience laughing]

07:49.975 --> 07:52.686
See, people started protesting
in front of the show,

07:52.769 --> 07:53.812
and people stopped showing up.

07:53.895 --> 07:55.897
Even though the shows were sold out

07:55.981 --> 07:59.192
because I was being deemed
a rapist or something. Yeah, okay.

08:00.568 --> 08:04.948
You know who never had someone protest
their gigs because of their material?

08:05.031 --> 08:06.616
Bill Cosby!

08:08.702 --> 08:12.247
'Cause you gotta give it to Bill.

08:12.330 --> 08:14.332
What a dignified man.

08:15.250 --> 08:19.379
He never said the swear words.
He never lowered himself...

08:21.131 --> 08:22.465
to my level.

08:22.549 --> 08:25.427
What a class act he is.

08:25.510 --> 08:27.637
[audience cheering and applauding]

08:32.433 --> 08:36.104
'Cause that's why
people went to see Bill Cosby,

08:36.187 --> 08:39.691
'cause they wanted to see
a good, clean, wholesome comedian...

08:39.774 --> 08:41.109
who rapes...

08:44.446 --> 08:49.951
rather than a person like myself, who is
just going to say horrible things...

08:50.035 --> 08:53.163
and rapes very occasionally,
like, hardly...

08:56.458 --> 08:58.960
I also got backlash
for my last special, <i>BARE,</i>

08:59.044 --> 09:00.211
which is also on Netflix.

09:00.295 --> 09:03.673
[stutters] I did a lot
of misogynistic jokes on that special.

09:03.757 --> 09:05.091
I'm not gonna hide behind it.

09:05.175 --> 09:07.886
I said a lot of misogynistic things
on <i>BARE,</i>

09:07.969 --> 09:09.596
and I got a lot of complaint letters.

09:09.679 --> 09:12.974
And, look, I find it weird because...

09:13.058 --> 09:15.393
<i>BARE</i> was my fifth special,

09:15.477 --> 09:20.148
and I feel like I've been misogynistic
on all my specials...

09:21.149 --> 09:24.110
and I haven't gotten a complaint letter
till now.

09:24.194 --> 09:25.737
It just proves that, with women,

09:25.820 --> 09:29.324
you really have to fucking repeat yourself
before they'll listen.

09:29.407 --> 09:30.784
[audience applauding]

09:33.536 --> 09:34.621
I...

09:35.747 --> 09:38.666
I'll defend a misogynistic joke
as I defended the rape joke,

09:38.750 --> 09:39.793
as I'll defend any jokes.

09:39.876 --> 09:41.669
It's... I'm joking.

09:41.753 --> 09:44.214
This is a performance. I'm an entertainer.

09:44.297 --> 09:45.799
This isn't a TED Talk.

09:47.050 --> 09:50.345
You're not meant to take
any of this fucking seriously.

09:51.304 --> 09:54.307
The only time the hate mail bothers me...

09:56.184 --> 10:00.063
is when it's directed at my girlfriend
or they write to her directly,

10:00.146 --> 10:01.106
the mother of my child.

10:01.189 --> 10:04.275
People will write to her
on Twitter or whatever,

10:04.359 --> 10:07.904
and say, "You have no self-respect
going out with Jim Jefferies."

10:07.987 --> 10:09.489
And I hate that.

10:09.572 --> 10:10.782
'Cause she knows that.

10:10.865 --> 10:11.783
She...

10:12.617 --> 10:16.454
She doesn't need you people bothering her.
She has fucking chores to do.

10:16.538 --> 10:17.705
Now...

10:17.789 --> 10:19.624
[audience laughing]

10:24.254 --> 10:28.049
I got my girlfriend pregnant
after knowing her for six weeks.

10:29.634 --> 10:31.970
I feel... Yeah, no,
it's not good, six weeks.

10:32.053 --> 10:35.306
I think she wants to get married,

10:35.390 --> 10:38.643
and the reason I think that
is 'cause she says that a lot.

10:39.561 --> 10:41.146
And I don't want to get married.

10:41.229 --> 10:44.065
Everyone in my life
is pressuring me into getting married.

10:44.149 --> 10:45.775
I hate when my mother
rings me up and goes,

10:45.859 --> 10:49.112
"Why don't you marry the girl?
You have a child with her."

10:49.195 --> 10:51.573
And I'm like, "Yeah, I've got a kid.

10:51.656 --> 10:53.575
An 18-year commitment.

10:53.658 --> 10:56.536
I've signed onto that
like a bad fucking phone contract."

10:56.619 --> 10:58.663
I'm a great dad.

10:58.746 --> 11:02.667
I got 15 years left, then I'm fucking off.

11:02.750 --> 11:06.087
But marriage is until death.

11:07.172 --> 11:08.965
It's a shit contract.

11:11.676 --> 11:15.889
Hundred years ago, the life expectancy
of an American was 52.

11:15.972 --> 11:18.141
Now it's 83.

11:18.224 --> 11:19.559
Fuck that!

11:19.642 --> 11:21.603
[audience laughing]

11:21.686 --> 11:24.272
I've got a life to live!

11:24.355 --> 11:27.901
If I was gonna die at 52,
sure, let's have some company.

11:29.444 --> 11:31.362
I would have got married in the Dark Ages,

11:31.446 --> 11:33.489
when 50% of women died during childbirth.

11:33.573 --> 11:36.534
I would have rolled the dice
on that bad boy.

11:40.496 --> 11:44.375
But she works out every day
and she eats kale just to spite me.

11:47.670 --> 11:50.715
Six weeks, she got pregnant.
Six weeks!

11:50.798 --> 11:52.258
I feel like I missed out on something.

11:53.217 --> 11:55.345
Six weeks is very quick to get pregnant.

11:56.346 --> 11:58.473
I missed out on the new girlfriend.

11:58.556 --> 12:00.391
The new girlfriend's the best time
of your life.

12:00.475 --> 12:03.728
That first three months
of the new boyfriend or girlfriend,

12:03.811 --> 12:06.814
the new relationship,
where the person's fucking perfect.

12:06.898 --> 12:09.651
And you're like, "Oh, my God...
I love this person."

12:09.734 --> 12:11.444
After a month, you're like, "This..."

12:11.527 --> 12:13.655
You're drinking with her like,
"She's drinking beer.

12:13.738 --> 12:14.864
Do you wanna watch <i>Star Wars?"</i>

12:14.948 --> 12:18.326
And she's like, "I do."
And you're like, "Fucking hell!"

12:18.409 --> 12:21.120
Yeah, and she's getting along
with your friends.

12:21.204 --> 12:22.538
Your mother's like,
"I think she's the one."

12:22.622 --> 12:24.082
You go, "I think she's the one as well."

12:26.626 --> 12:30.088
'Cause women can hold the psycho down
for three months.

12:31.297 --> 12:35.927
For three months, they can walk around
like a functioning member of society.

12:38.221 --> 12:41.474
Showing up at your work parties
and not crying.

12:45.395 --> 12:48.314
At three months and one day,
you come out of the shower,

12:48.398 --> 12:51.192
and she's huddled over your phone
like Gollum. Just...

12:51.275 --> 12:52.527
[audience laughing]

12:57.198 --> 13:00.618
So I went from the new girlfriend,
best feeling in the world,

13:00.702 --> 13:03.037
to dating a pregnant chick.

13:03.997 --> 13:08.167
Now, no one has ever said this
and never recorded anything like this.

13:08.251 --> 13:10.837
No one's ever said it in a public forum.

13:12.714 --> 13:16.300
But the pregnant
are the worst people on Earth.

13:16.384 --> 13:17.844
[audience laughing]

13:20.263 --> 13:21.806
For some reason,

13:21.889 --> 13:25.601
society has told us that they have
some type of glow or some shit.

13:26.811 --> 13:30.231
The pregnant are a bunch of cunts,
the pregnant.

13:30.314 --> 13:32.025
[audience cheering]

13:33.317 --> 13:34.819
They...

13:35.361 --> 13:37.947
They cry when they're happy,
when they're sad.

13:38.031 --> 13:39.574
You don't know what fucking cry...

13:39.657 --> 13:43.411
And you ever tried fighting
with a pregnant person in a public place?

13:43.494 --> 13:44.787
[exclaims]

13:44.871 --> 13:46.914
[audience laughing]

13:46.998 --> 13:49.834
Doesn't matter how right you are.

13:51.627 --> 13:53.838
Me and Kate,
she was seven months pregnant,

13:53.921 --> 13:57.175
were walking around the supermarket,
right? Walking around...

13:57.258 --> 13:59.844
and I got some Coco Pops
to put in the trolley.

13:59.927 --> 14:02.972
Now, you call them Cocoa Krispies
in this country.

14:03.056 --> 14:05.767
How different our cultures are. And...

14:07.351 --> 14:10.480
I put the Coco Pops in the shopping cart.

14:10.563 --> 14:11.689
"Trolley."

14:11.773 --> 14:13.232
And, uh...

14:15.276 --> 14:18.863
And Kate picked them up
and put them back on the shelf.

14:18.946 --> 14:20.865
It was very confusing

14:20.948 --> 14:24.952
'cause I'd never seen Coco Pops
go in the opposite direction.

14:25.036 --> 14:26.662
[audience laughing]

14:28.706 --> 14:31.834
And my brain skipped a bit,
and I went, "Uh..."

14:33.878 --> 14:34.879
[exhales]

14:37.090 --> 14:40.426
"I think you made a mistake there, Kate."

14:40.510 --> 14:44.764
And I went to get them back,
and she goes, "You're not having them."

14:44.847 --> 14:48.184
And I went, "But I... I always have them."

14:49.185 --> 14:52.230
And she went, "You're getting fat."

14:54.399 --> 14:56.192
[audience laughing]

15:00.738 --> 15:05.034
So I did my drop-the-mic moment.
I picked up the Coco Pops and went...

15:09.330 --> 15:11.499
And she snapped and went,

15:11.582 --> 15:13.251
"Do you want me to lose this baby?"

15:13.334 --> 15:16.129
And I went,
"Um, fuck, that was quick!

15:17.338 --> 15:20.716
Of course I do.
You're a fucking nightmare!"

15:26.180 --> 15:29.934
You ever been in a bar at 4:00 a.m.,
talking to some guy,

15:30.017 --> 15:32.145
and he's telling you
how shitty his life is?

15:32.895 --> 15:36.274
And he's like,
"My dad, my dad's an asshole.

15:36.357 --> 15:38.359
Didn't even know my dad.

15:38.443 --> 15:41.237
Walked out on my mum
when she was pregnant with me."

15:41.320 --> 15:43.364
And I used to think, "What a dick."

15:43.448 --> 15:44.740
And now I'm like...

15:44.824 --> 15:46.117
[grunts]

15:46.200 --> 15:47.952
[audience laughing]

15:49.412 --> 15:51.831
"I'm sure he had his reasons.

15:53.666 --> 15:55.376
Who am I to judge, eh?"

15:56.794 --> 16:01.299
So she gets pregnant.
We got to go to these baby classes.

16:02.633 --> 16:04.594
We go to baby classes at the hospital,

16:04.677 --> 16:07.263
where they teach you
how to put nappies on and shit.

16:07.346 --> 16:09.307
And you swaddle.

16:09.390 --> 16:12.393
You've got [stutters] the dummy,
and you swaddle it.

16:12.477 --> 16:14.854
And then the lady goes,
"That's a good swaddle."

16:14.937 --> 16:17.940
And you go, "I thought it was.
I've been practicing."

16:20.359 --> 16:22.737
Most of it's watching videos
from the '80s.

16:22.820 --> 16:23.946
They put on actual videos.

16:24.071 --> 16:26.032
You're meant to watch
and learn how to parent.

16:26.115 --> 16:29.994
One of the videos we watched
was called <i>Don't Shake the Baby.</i>

16:32.705 --> 16:35.458
<i>Don't Shake the Baby </i> is 40 minutes long.

16:37.418 --> 16:40.213
You don't need to watch
<i>Don't Shake the Baby.</i>

16:40.296 --> 16:43.257
All the information you need is
in the title.

16:45.843 --> 16:49.514
Who picks up a copy
of <i> Don't Shake the Baby</i>

16:49.597 --> 16:51.974
and thinks to themselves, "Oh...

16:52.934 --> 16:54.894
maybe there's more to this.

16:56.979 --> 17:00.441
[stutters] But what if I'm really angry?

17:02.109 --> 17:05.655
What if I'm shaking my wife
and she's holding the baby?"

17:09.450 --> 17:11.743
The course
was basically a Tupperware party.

17:11.827 --> 17:13.037
Trying to sell us shit.

17:13.119 --> 17:15.248
And we bought a car seat, and a stroller,

17:15.330 --> 17:18.960
and this thing you put the bottle in
that steams and sterilizes it.

17:19.042 --> 17:21.253
If you don't have the steamy,
sterilizey machine,

17:21.337 --> 17:23.839
you gotta boil the bottles,
and that's a pain in the ass.

17:23.923 --> 17:28.094
All right, here's a tip.
You don't have to sterilize baby bottles.

17:28.176 --> 17:31.597
I stopped sterilizing Hank's bottles
after two days.

17:33.015 --> 17:35.393
I told Kate I was still doing it.

17:38.437 --> 17:40.273
But I wasn't.

17:41.357 --> 17:43.484
And I'll tell you why.

17:43.568 --> 17:46.070
Because 80% of the time,
he's being breast-fed.

17:46.153 --> 17:47.905
And we never sterilize those tits.

17:47.989 --> 17:52.618
We never had a special
steamy, cleany machine for the tits.

17:52.702 --> 17:55.288
In fact, for the first three weeks
after the birth,

17:55.371 --> 17:59.166
her cunt was all fucked up,
so I used to jack off on the tits.

17:59.250 --> 18:00.543
And he'd wake up

18:00.626 --> 18:03.212
- and have a midnight feeding.
- [audience laughing]

18:03.296 --> 18:07.508
And what I'm saying is,
no one's dead, are they?

18:08.426 --> 18:09.969
Like...

18:10.052 --> 18:13.889
Sure, he gets cold sores
and whatnot. But...

18:15.433 --> 18:17.435
he's different.

18:17.518 --> 18:20.730
He's a unique little boy. Leave him alone!

18:23.232 --> 18:24.650
So anyway...

18:27.695 --> 18:32.158
when you impregnate a person
that you don't know particularly well,

18:33.367 --> 18:37.663
sometimes, when it comes to parenting,
you're not on the same page.

18:37.747 --> 18:41.208
So me and Kate were watching <i>60 Minutes</i>,
or <i>20/20</i> or something,

18:41.292 --> 18:44.545
and they were doing
a story on vaccination,

18:44.629 --> 18:46.047
and I turned to Kate and said,

18:46.130 --> 18:48.257
"People who don't vaccinate their kids

18:48.341 --> 18:49.550
are a pain in the ass."

18:49.634 --> 18:52.261
And Kate said, "Hank's not vaccinated."

18:52.345 --> 18:54.472
And I went, "Oh, fuck."

18:56.432 --> 18:58.142
You know when someone says something

18:58.225 --> 19:02.063
and your brain goes,
"That's gonna take up a lot of your time"?

19:04.982 --> 19:07.526
'Cause the dynamic
of our relationship is this.

19:07.610 --> 19:12.448
I go on the road and tell jokes
to make the family money.

19:12.531 --> 19:16.744
She's meant to stay home
and make sure that Hank doesn't die.

19:18.788 --> 19:22.249
And, between me and you,
I think she's doing a shit job.

19:24.752 --> 19:27.588
And I said, "Why isn't he vaccinated?"

19:27.672 --> 19:30.091
And she goes,
"I think it leads to autism."

19:30.174 --> 19:34.470
And I went, "Oh, what medical evidence
do you have that it leads to autism?"

19:34.553 --> 19:35.596
And she said, "Jenny..."

19:35.680 --> 19:38.641
And I said,
"Don't even fucking say 'McCarthy.'

19:39.558 --> 19:40.601
Don't even say it,

19:40.685 --> 19:43.312
'cause that's not evidence,
that's Jenny McCarthy.

19:43.396 --> 19:46.941
I have nothing against the woman.
She's a comedian and a Playmate.

19:47.024 --> 19:49.777
They're my two favorite types of people.

19:50.695 --> 19:54.657
But I don't get my medical advice
from them. It's one of my things."

19:54.740 --> 19:56.742
And she went, "But her son's autistic."

19:56.826 --> 19:58.536
And I went, "Is he?

20:01.414 --> 20:04.041
Is he really?

20:04.667 --> 20:07.378
Or is he just Jenny McCarthy's kid?"

20:07.461 --> 20:08.838
[audience cheering]

20:10.464 --> 20:11.507
All right.

20:14.218 --> 20:19.390
"Did we expect a member of Mensa
to fall out of that woman?"

20:21.600 --> 20:23.352
And she said,
"What difference does it make?

20:23.436 --> 20:25.563
No one gets smallpox. No one gets polio."

20:25.646 --> 20:27.314
It's frustrating when they say that,

20:27.398 --> 20:30.818
because you're like, [mockingly]
"Because of fucking vaccination."

20:33.529 --> 20:36.866
[normal voice] I said,
"And furthermore, my mother had polio."

20:36.949 --> 20:39.535
That's true, Gunta had polio.

20:39.618 --> 20:42.997
My mother can work polio
into any conversation.

20:43.080 --> 20:46.459
You'll be having dinner with my mother
and she'll go, "Ah...

20:46.542 --> 20:48.878
maybe I will have some chocolate cake.

20:48.961 --> 20:51.172
'Cause I couldn't when I was young.

20:52.089 --> 20:53.549
I had polio."

20:55.551 --> 20:59.513
I believe that my mother secretly loves
the fact that she had polio,

20:59.597 --> 21:03.642
'cause polio does a lot of heavy lifting
for her shit personality.

21:03.726 --> 21:05.519
[audience laughing]

21:08.147 --> 21:11.525
Anyway, so we fought,
and we fought, and we fought,

21:11.609 --> 21:12.610
and I didn't win.

21:12.693 --> 21:15.029
Can't win every argument.
Hank's not getting vaccinated.

21:15.112 --> 21:19.158
So cut to three weeks later,

21:19.241 --> 21:22.661
we're doing Season 2 of <i>Legit,</i>
and I had to do a medical...

21:22.745 --> 21:24.079
- [man whistles]
- Oh, thank you.

21:24.163 --> 21:25.748
[audience applauding]

21:26.791 --> 21:27.917
Um...

21:29.877 --> 21:31.962
I think we were
the only ones who liked it.

21:32.046 --> 21:33.422
I, uh...

21:33.506 --> 21:35.758
We're doing Season 2 of <i>Legit,</i>

21:35.841 --> 21:39.970
and the network are trying
to insure me for $8 million.

21:40.054 --> 21:41.138
That's how much a season costs.

21:41.222 --> 21:43.140
So I have to do a studio physical.

21:43.224 --> 21:44.892
And they're insuring me in case I die,

21:44.975 --> 21:46.685
'cause the show would've ended.

21:46.769 --> 21:49.814
Or if I got some mental problem
and started stabbing people.

21:49.897 --> 21:51.774
That would also be a problem.

21:51.857 --> 21:53.359
It's like a three-hour physical.

21:53.442 --> 21:55.903
I'm jogging on treadmills,
and psychological tests...

21:55.986 --> 21:57.822
I'm jogging on this treadmill
with all these things on me

21:57.905 --> 21:59.657
and this tube coming out of my mouth.

21:59.740 --> 22:01.951
I get off,
and the doctor's writing something down.

22:02.034 --> 22:04.537
And I thought,
"I'll slip it into conversation,"

22:04.620 --> 22:06.539
and I went, "Hey.

22:07.540 --> 22:09.333
It's, um...

22:09.416 --> 22:11.919
It's not that important
to vaccinate kids, is it?"

22:13.254 --> 22:15.589
And she went,
"Only if you want them to live."

22:15.673 --> 22:16.715
Right?

22:17.258 --> 22:21.512
[chuckling]
She didn't even look up, right?

22:21.595 --> 22:23.514
And I said, "Are you serious?"

22:23.597 --> 22:25.683
And she goes, "Let me put it this way.

22:25.766 --> 22:29.728
I would not let my children
play with an unvaccinated child."

22:29.853 --> 22:32.690
So I thought,
"That's all the information I need."

22:32.773 --> 22:35.693
So behind Kate's back...

22:38.195 --> 22:40.573
and this is super illegal...

22:42.157 --> 22:45.744
and involves
forging her signature three times...

22:47.913 --> 22:51.041
I booked Hank in
to get all of his shots on one day,

22:51.125 --> 22:55.087
which the doctor didn't recommend,
but I'm a busy guy.

22:55.170 --> 22:56.922
[audience laughing]

22:58.299 --> 23:00.426
Now, I was about to come home

23:00.509 --> 23:03.429
to pick up Hank
to take him to get his vaccination shots.

23:03.512 --> 23:05.848
I knew that Kate was going to be home
with Hank,

23:05.931 --> 23:08.142
so I knew we were
about to have the biggest fight ever.

23:08.225 --> 23:10.311
You know when you're
about to fight with your partner,

23:10.394 --> 23:12.730
but they don't know you're about to
have a fight,

23:12.855 --> 23:15.149
so you have the upper hand?

23:15.232 --> 23:19.111
So what you do is, you think horrible shit
about that person all day,

23:19.194 --> 23:22.573
so in case they cry,
you can enjoy yourself.

23:22.656 --> 23:23.991
[audience laughing]

23:24.908 --> 23:28.245
No matter what happens,
I will always say this.

23:28.329 --> 23:31.624
Kate is the nicest human being
I have ever met.

23:31.707 --> 23:33.542
For niceness, I can't fault her.

23:33.626 --> 23:37.755
[stutters] She is just a good soul.
She only sees the good in people.

23:37.838 --> 23:40.966
She will never say a bad word
about another human being.

23:41.050 --> 23:43.302
And... so it's weird.
So I'm driving home,

23:43.385 --> 23:47.222
I'm trying to think bad thoughts
about the nicest person on Earth,

23:47.306 --> 23:48.641
and it's really difficult.

23:48.724 --> 23:52.061
So I'm in my car like, "Fucking Kate.

23:53.896 --> 23:57.816
Who the fuck does she think she is,
fucking...

23:57.900 --> 23:59.818
keeping the house nice?

24:02.529 --> 24:04.031
Fucking bitch.

24:07.534 --> 24:09.078
She left that plate in the sink.

24:09.161 --> 24:10.954
That was a fucking nightmare.
I remember that.

24:15.292 --> 24:17.419
Oh, no, that was me. I did that.

24:19.838 --> 24:21.965
But she cleaned it up,
and that's enabling,

24:22.049 --> 24:25.302
and that's fucking bullshit right there."

24:25.386 --> 24:27.388
So I came back just fucking steaming.

24:27.471 --> 24:30.224
"All right, here we fucking go.
Game's on."

24:30.307 --> 24:33.644
I come home, she's sitting down,
lovingly playing with our child,

24:33.727 --> 24:35.813
and she looks up and she goes,
"Hey, honey!"

24:35.938 --> 24:39.358
And I went, "Don't... fucking 'honey' me!"

24:41.110 --> 24:45.322
And she said, "What's wrong?"
And I said, "I'll tell you what's right!

24:45.406 --> 24:48.659
Hank's getting vaccinated today,
and there's nothing you can do!"

24:48.742 --> 24:51.203
And I pick up Hank,
and she starts screaming.

24:51.286 --> 24:53.997
He's one,
so he's super attached to his mother.

24:54.081 --> 24:55.416
And he's like, "Mummy, Mummy!"

24:55.499 --> 24:57.918
I'm like, "Your mum
can't fucking help you now!"

24:58.001 --> 24:59.503
[audience laughing]

24:59.586 --> 25:01.422
I go out to where the car's parked.

25:01.505 --> 25:03.465
I throw him in.
I'm doing him up in his seat.

25:03.549 --> 25:05.759
Kate comes out
and she starts slapping my back.

25:05.843 --> 25:07.302
I'm like, "Get the fuck off me!"

25:07.386 --> 25:09.680
She dramatically falls to the ground.

25:09.763 --> 25:13.100
I look up, and two of the neighbors
are out of their houses.

25:13.183 --> 25:17.271
They're quintessentially watching me
kidnap a child and beat up my girlfriend.

25:17.354 --> 25:19.106
[audience laughing]

25:19.189 --> 25:22.234
And I'm too far gone now,
so I doubled down and went,

25:22.317 --> 25:25.195
"Get back in your fucking houses!"

25:25.279 --> 25:27.364
Then I put him in his seat.

25:28.282 --> 25:32.202
I got in the driver's seat
and I fucking fishtailed out of there.

25:32.286 --> 25:35.956
And Kate's on her knees
and she screams out, "Fine!

25:36.874 --> 25:39.668
But if he becomes autistic, it's on you!"

25:44.173 --> 25:47.676
And I thought,
"Would she consider that a win?"

25:50.637 --> 25:52.973
So anyway...

25:53.056 --> 25:54.183
I take Hank off.

25:54.266 --> 25:56.852
I get him all of his shots.

25:56.935 --> 25:58.520
I bring him home.

26:00.272 --> 26:02.316
And he's definitely autistic now.

26:02.399 --> 26:03.942
[audience laughing]

26:05.986 --> 26:07.237
It's like night and day,

26:07.321 --> 26:10.032
like, the kid before the shots
and the kid after...

26:10.115 --> 26:12.659
Before the shots, he was this lively kid,
afterwards,

26:12.743 --> 26:14.578
I brought him home,
he's sitting in the corner, going...

26:14.661 --> 26:15.829
[screaming]

26:15.913 --> 26:18.791
And I'm like, "Oh, fuck!

26:18.874 --> 26:21.794
Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck.

26:21.877 --> 26:24.171
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

26:24.254 --> 26:25.464
Oh...

26:26.381 --> 26:28.383
Oh, Kate's gonna notice this."

26:28.467 --> 26:30.177
[audience laughing]

26:37.017 --> 26:42.189
And so, I did whatever I did
when I knew I was in trouble. I lie.

26:43.607 --> 26:45.150
So I put Hank in a BabyBjörn.

26:45.234 --> 26:47.945
He's hanging off me like... [screams]
hanging off my chest.

26:48.028 --> 26:50.447
'Cause I couldn't let him
have alone time with Kate,

26:50.531 --> 26:52.282
'cause Kate would see it right away.

26:52.366 --> 26:55.160
I know what you're thinking.
I couldn't keep that up forever.

26:55.244 --> 26:56.703
But I did have a plan.

26:56.787 --> 26:58.664
What I was gonna do was, right,

26:58.747 --> 27:02.501
I was gonna stand near a door
that I knew Kate was gonna come through.

27:05.963 --> 27:07.714
"Look what you did!" Like that.

27:12.970 --> 27:17.266
Okay, so anyway,
I am making light of a situation...

27:18.684 --> 27:20.477
that was... it was horrible, man.

27:20.561 --> 27:21.728
[stutters]

27:21.812 --> 27:25.983
It's nice to make jokes about it now,
but at the time I was distraught.

27:26.066 --> 27:28.986
I didn't sleep for three days.
I couldn't eat.

27:29.069 --> 27:31.405
My brain was on a loop. I was so wired...

27:31.488 --> 27:32.948
I was rocking back and forth.

27:33.031 --> 27:35.784
"Your kid's autistic.
It's all your fault." [mumbles]

27:35.868 --> 27:39.413
So anyway, cut to three days later.

27:39.496 --> 27:41.790
I go to the doctor
to get the results of my physical,

27:41.874 --> 27:43.959
and Hank's dangling off me.
[groans]

27:44.042 --> 27:45.961
And...

27:46.044 --> 27:49.298
the doctor comes in and goes,
"How are we today, Mr. Jefferies?"

27:49.381 --> 27:53.427
And I said, "Not good.
[stutters] You told me to vaccinate Hank.

27:53.510 --> 27:56.471
You said, 'Vaccinate kid, good.'
But this is not good.

27:56.555 --> 27:59.349
[stutters] This used to be a good kid.
Look at this.

27:59.433 --> 28:00.809
Fucking shit kid."

28:00.893 --> 28:02.436
[audience laughing]

28:06.565 --> 28:08.275
And she goes, "Can you calm down?"

28:08.358 --> 28:10.986
I said, "No, I can't,
I haven't slept for three days.

28:11.069 --> 28:13.488
I'm wired, my brain's on a loop,
and I can't turn it off...

28:13.572 --> 28:15.073
because my kid's autistic.
It's all my fault.

28:15.157 --> 28:18.201
[repeating]
My kid's autistic. It's all my fault.

28:18.285 --> 28:20.537
My kid's autistic. It's all my fault."
[breathes heavily]

28:21.914 --> 28:24.166
And she looked at my chart and said,

28:24.249 --> 28:29.838
"Now... you know that you
have a tendency to overreact

28:29.922 --> 28:32.716
because you're on the spectrum."

28:34.468 --> 28:36.553
"You fucking what, when?"

28:38.347 --> 28:40.766
"You know,
how you have little empathy,

28:40.849 --> 28:44.311
you don't listen when others talk,
and you don't make eye contact."

28:47.814 --> 28:50.317
"I've heard about the eye contact."

28:53.570 --> 28:57.574
She goes,
"There's nothing wrong with Hank.

28:57.658 --> 28:59.743
He's just drugged out right now.

28:59.826 --> 29:03.455
You gave him all of his shots in one day,
which I didn't recommend."

29:03.538 --> 29:05.082
[audience laughing]

29:12.422 --> 29:13.590
Now...

29:13.674 --> 29:15.217
[audience applauding]

29:18.595 --> 29:22.015
It's true that the next day,
Hank was back to his normal self.

29:22.099 --> 29:23.850
There's nothing wrong with Hank.

29:23.934 --> 29:26.311
But it turns out that I'm autistic.

29:26.395 --> 29:27.604
[audience laughing]

29:32.234 --> 29:34.194
I don't know.
I don't know if I believe it,

29:34.278 --> 29:36.655
'cause the spectrum is very broad.

29:36.738 --> 29:39.408
Like, 1% to Ben Carsons or something.

29:39.491 --> 29:41.118
- Uh...
- [audience laughing]

29:45.163 --> 29:49.376
So I don't know. I think a lot of times,
people just diagnose personalities.

29:49.459 --> 29:52.462
I'm a bit of a dick. Can't we just...
[chuckles]

29:53.380 --> 29:55.799
But it's weird.
I was 36 when they told me that.

29:55.882 --> 30:00.053
It's weird when you find out
that you're autistic at 36.

30:00.137 --> 30:01.847
'Cause it's big news for me.

30:01.930 --> 30:06.685
[belches] And then I rang up
everyone I knew and told them,

30:06.768 --> 30:08.729
and no one was surprised.

30:08.812 --> 30:10.522
[audience laughing]

30:14.234 --> 30:15.736
I rang up me mum,

30:15.819 --> 30:18.613
and I left a message
on her voice machine like this,

30:18.697 --> 30:22.784
"Mum, you gotta call me back!
I have the biggest news ever!"

30:23.535 --> 30:27.581
And my mum rang me back and went,
"You're getting married."

30:27.664 --> 30:30.792
And I went, "No! I'm autistic!"

30:30.876 --> 30:33.628
And she went,
"Oh, everyone knows you're autistic.

30:35.630 --> 30:38.967
It's not that bad.
When I was a child, I had polio."

30:39.051 --> 30:40.761
[audience laughing]

30:41.428 --> 30:43.138
[audience cheering]

30:50.228 --> 30:52.773
Hank, though...
Hank... Hank's a smart kid.

30:52.856 --> 30:56.151
I think he's smart,
'cause he's the only kid I know.

30:57.861 --> 31:00.614
[stutters] I don't hang out
with other kids.

31:00.697 --> 31:03.575
He's just turned three, but when he
was two, we put him into school.

31:03.658 --> 31:06.161
When he was two,
my friends used to come over all the time,

31:06.244 --> 31:09.790
and I was such a proud father
that I'd be like, "Hank's a genius."

31:09.873 --> 31:11.249
They're like, "How do you know?"

31:11.333 --> 31:14.002
I'm like, "What's that?"
Hank would go, "Red fire truck."

31:14.086 --> 31:17.714
I'd be like, "Damn fucking straight,
it's a red fire truck.

31:17.798 --> 31:20.884
I taught him that, 'Red fire truck.'"

31:21.593 --> 31:24.846
Anyway, we put him into
this preschool for two-year-olds.

31:24.930 --> 31:27.849
It was a fancy one in Hollywood.

31:27.933 --> 31:30.936
It costs a lot of money,
but the school is kind of cool.

31:31.061 --> 31:33.605
They teach him how to swim.
They toilet train him.

31:33.688 --> 31:35.107
They got this great big turtle

31:35.190 --> 31:38.276
that walks amongst the kids
like a shitty Jurassic Park.

31:40.862 --> 31:42.697
And on the first day,

31:42.781 --> 31:45.367
we went there to meet
the other parents, the teachers,

31:45.450 --> 31:46.952
and the other students and everything.

31:47.035 --> 31:48.995
So I show up early.
Me and Hank at the school.

31:49.079 --> 31:51.915
And we got there early, like an hour
before everyone else.

31:51.998 --> 31:55.335
And we're there, the turtle walks by,
I'm with Hank, and I went,

31:55.419 --> 31:59.256
"Hank, that's a turtle.
Can you say 'turtle'?"

31:59.339 --> 32:02.717
And then this kid walks up
and goes, "Hi, I'm Simon."

32:03.760 --> 32:06.263
"All right. Hello, Simon."

32:06.346 --> 32:10.058
And he goes, "Actually, I'm Simon III.
I'm the third Simon.

32:10.142 --> 32:13.520
My dad's a Simon.
His dad's a Simon, that's my grandfather.

32:13.603 --> 32:16.815
So, one, two, three, third Simon."

32:20.485 --> 32:22.487
"All right."

32:22.571 --> 32:24.573
"When I grow up,
I wanna be a baseball player.

32:24.656 --> 32:25.782
I can't decide which team

32:25.866 --> 32:27.993
because Mum likes the Angels
and Dad likes the Dodgers.

32:28.076 --> 32:31.037
So, there's a bit of conflict at home."

32:34.166 --> 32:36.376
"How old are you, Simon?"

32:36.460 --> 32:38.420
Simon did not give me his age.

32:38.503 --> 32:40.839
Simon gave me his date of birth.

32:42.716 --> 32:46.595
And it turned out that Simon
was three months younger than Hank.

32:46.678 --> 32:49.431
And I turned and I looked
at my fucking idiot son.

32:49.514 --> 32:51.308
[audience laughing]

32:54.769 --> 32:56.980
And Hank went, "Turtle!"

32:57.063 --> 32:58.857
[audience laughing]

33:05.864 --> 33:09.493
And I said, "Yes, Hank, that's a turtle."

33:11.620 --> 33:13.121
And then Simon went...

33:14.414 --> 33:15.749
"That's a tortoise."

33:15.832 --> 33:17.501
[audience laughing]

33:22.339 --> 33:24.925
I didn't know that before.

33:25.008 --> 33:27.802
Turns out that tortoises just live
on the land,

33:27.886 --> 33:30.722
and turtles live in the water
and on the land.

33:31.640 --> 33:33.433
Simon taught me that!

33:33.517 --> 33:35.060
[audience laughing]

33:40.315 --> 33:43.276
See, one of my old jokes
has come back to haunt me.

33:45.028 --> 33:46.988
If you're a dumb cunt...

33:47.072 --> 33:48.823
[audience laughing]

33:51.326 --> 33:53.078
[audience cheering]

33:55.789 --> 33:59.709
...and your wife or your husband
is a dumb cunt...

34:00.710 --> 34:04.005
guess what your fucking kids are?

34:04.089 --> 34:06.925
Let's just say
that Kate's not a scientist.

34:08.969 --> 34:12.054
See, I go to these school events
and I meet the other parents,

34:12.138 --> 34:13.848
and I get intimidated
when I meet educated people

34:13.931 --> 34:15.766
'cause I'm not super educated.

34:15.850 --> 34:20.688
So, whenever I meet this guy,
Simon II, that fucking cunt, right?

34:20.772 --> 34:22.107
Simon III's dad.

34:22.190 --> 34:25.569
He's a thoracic surgeon
and his wife's a pediatrician.

34:25.652 --> 34:28.822
And I'm chatting
to the fucking Simons, right?

34:28.905 --> 34:31.533
And I can't keep up with the conversation,

34:31.616 --> 34:35.120
but I don't wanna sound dumb,
so I just say shit.

34:35.203 --> 34:37.956
We're talking about politics or something,

34:38.039 --> 34:42.168
and I just went,
just trying to keep up, I went, "Ah...

34:42.252 --> 34:45.672
I reckon they should
try to catch that Benghazi guy."

34:45.755 --> 34:47.632
[audience laughing]

34:51.803 --> 34:56.181
And then, everyone looks at me
like I'm an idiot, and I went...

34:59.311 --> 35:02.981
And Simon II goes,
"Jim, I didn't catch...

35:03.064 --> 35:05.442
What do you do for a living there, Jim?"

35:05.525 --> 35:07.360
And I went, "Um...

35:08.945 --> 35:10.572
I'm a comedian."

35:10.655 --> 35:13.700
And he goes, "Oh, me and my wife,
we just love comedy.

35:13.783 --> 35:16.995
We'd love to catch
one of your shows sometime."

35:18.913 --> 35:20.624
"You wouldn't like it..."

35:20.707 --> 35:22.459
[audience laughing]

35:25.337 --> 35:28.048
He goes, "What type of comedy do you do?"
"Um..."

35:30.050 --> 35:31.426
[huffs]

35:32.969 --> 35:34.220
"Like, um..."

35:35.889 --> 35:37.307
[sighs]

35:37.390 --> 35:39.851
"I say 'cunt' more than anyone else.

35:41.102 --> 35:42.979
- I...
- [audience cheering]

35:45.357 --> 35:46.399
I...

35:47.901 --> 35:50.528
I'm sort of known for saying 'cunt.'

35:50.612 --> 35:54.324
Seven years ago, when I did
my first comedy special in America,

35:54.407 --> 35:57.661
the word 'cunt' was banned
in every comedy club in America,

35:57.744 --> 36:00.497
and then I said 'cunt'
loads on television,

36:00.580 --> 36:04.876
and now, people can say 'cunt'
in comedy clubs. So, I'm...

36:04.959 --> 36:07.379
[audience cheering and applauding]

36:10.882 --> 36:15.345
Basically... basically,
I'm the Rosa Parks of 'cunt.'"

36:15.428 --> 36:17.389
[audience laughing and cheering]

36:22.435 --> 36:23.978
[chuckles]

36:25.647 --> 36:29.275
Now, at this school,
they do toilet train him, right?

36:29.359 --> 36:33.196
But I'm not happy,
'cause it's just female staff

36:33.279 --> 36:37.158
and they're teaching every child
to do sit-down wees.

36:37.242 --> 36:41.413
It's all right for the girls,
but the boys should do a stand-up wee.

36:41.496 --> 36:43.957
They shouldn't be doing sit-down wees.

36:44.040 --> 36:47.961
Now, I like a sit-down wee
as much as the next man...

36:49.629 --> 36:52.757
but there is a place and a time for it.

36:52.841 --> 36:55.719
These are the only times
you should do sit-down wees.

36:55.802 --> 36:57.679
You always have to be at your house.

36:57.762 --> 37:01.558
You can't do it in other people's houses.
It's weird.

37:01.641 --> 37:03.643
You have to be at your house

37:03.727 --> 37:05.019
and drunk.

37:07.439 --> 37:09.607
And then you'll be like,

37:09.691 --> 37:12.068
"Oh, I'm gonna have a lovely sit-down wee.

37:12.152 --> 37:15.947
Oh, yeah, I'll...
I'll treat meself. Whoa."

37:18.366 --> 37:19.868
[chuckles]

37:21.161 --> 37:24.539
"I'll go back downstairs in a second.
I won't fall asleep. Stay awake.

37:24.622 --> 37:27.417
Come on, have a little sit-down wee."

37:27.500 --> 37:30.086
And the other time
you can have a sit-down wee

37:30.170 --> 37:32.005
is if you wake up
in the middle of the night

37:32.088 --> 37:34.674
and you wanna go to the toilet,
but you don't wanna turn the light on

37:34.758 --> 37:37.719
because it'll hurt your eyes
and you'll wake up too much.

37:37.802 --> 37:39.512
[audience applauding]

37:41.014 --> 37:42.640
So, what you do is,

37:42.724 --> 37:44.976
out of respect,
so you don't piss everywhere,

37:45.059 --> 37:46.227
you have a sit-down wee.

37:46.311 --> 37:49.773
And that's always a sleepy...
"All right, you lovely wee."

37:50.690 --> 37:53.401
And because you're sitting,
sometimes your asshole goes,

37:53.485 --> 37:56.237
- "Are we pooing?"
- [audience laughing]

37:56.321 --> 37:58.490
And you're like, "No, we're not pooing.

37:58.573 --> 38:01.534
We're just having a sit-down wee.
I'm sorry."

38:02.744 --> 38:05.246
"Oh, I thought we were pooing."

38:05.330 --> 38:09.751
"No, no, no.
We'll see you in the morning, asshole."

38:12.796 --> 38:16.049
[chuckling] And I want him to be good
at the sit-down wee.

38:16.132 --> 38:18.551
It's important to me.

38:18.635 --> 38:22.555
Because... Do you remember
when you were about seven?

38:22.639 --> 38:25.934
A weirdly sort-of-old-age like seven,

38:26.017 --> 38:28.478
and all the boys at school
would go to have a piss.

38:28.561 --> 38:30.647
They'd walk up, and undo their belt,

38:30.730 --> 38:32.607
undo their fly, pull out their dick,

38:32.690 --> 38:33.733
and have a piss.

38:33.817 --> 38:37.737
And then there was that one kid,
for whatever reason,

38:37.821 --> 38:41.491
had to have his pants and his underwear
down by his ankles.

38:41.574 --> 38:43.493
[audience laughing and applauding]

38:45.161 --> 38:49.874
And he'd stand there with his asshole
hanging out of the bottom of his shirt.

38:52.961 --> 38:55.797
"This is how I've always done it."

38:55.880 --> 38:57.340
[chuckles]

38:59.175 --> 39:02.846
Yeah, Hank, he got toilet-trained
just under the wire,

39:02.929 --> 39:04.055
'cause he's three now,

39:04.138 --> 39:06.766
and he got toilet-trained
just before his birthday.

39:06.850 --> 39:09.310
You wanna be toilet-trained
before you turn three.

39:09.435 --> 39:10.812
After that, it gets weird.

39:10.895 --> 39:14.440
There's people in the crowd who have
a 4-year-old who isn't toilet-trained.

39:14.524 --> 39:16.901
And you're feeling shame
right now, I know,

39:16.985 --> 39:18.736
'cause I have friends with 4-year-olds...

39:18.820 --> 39:20.238
See, this is the rule in life.

39:20.321 --> 39:21.739
You're allowed to shit your pants

39:21.823 --> 39:25.702
in the first and the last three years
of your life.

39:25.785 --> 39:28.329
Everything else gets odd, right?

39:29.581 --> 39:33.668
Now, a 4-year-old
shouldn't be shitting their pants

39:33.751 --> 39:36.796
'cause you can have a conversation
with a 4-year-old.

39:36.880 --> 39:39.299
And you should never be able
to have a conversation

39:39.382 --> 39:42.135
with someone who's shitting their pants.

39:43.386 --> 39:46.389
So my mates are over my house.
I've got pinball machines.

39:46.472 --> 39:48.808
We're playing pinball,
and his son walks up,

39:48.892 --> 39:52.729
and, dead set, this was the conversation.
His son walks up like this.

39:54.105 --> 39:55.440
"Hey, Dad.

39:56.107 --> 39:58.902
You're gonna have to change me, mate.
I just shit my pants."

39:58.985 --> 40:00.737
[audience laughing]

40:03.072 --> 40:07.744
And the dad was so embarrassed,
he was like, "Don't! Stop that! Oh!

40:08.870 --> 40:11.706
Can you please stop shitting your pants?"

40:11.789 --> 40:14.375
And the son responded like this...

40:17.128 --> 40:20.089
"Are we gonna
have this argument every time?"

40:20.173 --> 40:21.591
[audience laughing]

40:24.636 --> 40:27.138
So I went to Kate,
'cause he was about to turn three,

40:27.221 --> 40:30.516
and I said, "Kate,
Hank's gotta stop shitting his pants."

40:30.600 --> 40:33.561
So, she read a book, and
comes to me with this information.

40:33.645 --> 40:37.815
"You have to start
shitting in front of Hank."

40:41.444 --> 40:44.656
And I went,
"I don't wanna shit in front of Hank.

40:44.739 --> 40:46.741
What have I gotta
shit in front of Hank for?"

40:46.824 --> 40:49.202
She goes, "It says in the book
that he's a caveman,

40:49.285 --> 40:50.453
if he's left to his own devices,

40:50.536 --> 40:52.789
he'll shit in his hand
and chuck it at us."

40:52.872 --> 40:54.832
[audience laughing]

41:01.714 --> 41:05.385
And she goes, "He's like,
'Monkey see, monkey do.'

41:05.468 --> 41:06.886
He's gotta see someone using the seat.

41:06.970 --> 41:09.514
He's gotta see someone
using the toilet paper..."

41:09.597 --> 41:10.640
You know, that type of stuff.

41:10.723 --> 41:14.018
And I said,
"Why don't you shit in front of Hank?"

41:14.102 --> 41:17.855
She goes, "He has to see the cock
and balls, or he'll get confused."

41:20.191 --> 41:22.902
For a while there,
I was shitting in front of Hank.

41:26.114 --> 41:28.408
Man, it was a big adjustment for me.

41:30.118 --> 41:34.539
'Cause my shits used to be
these quiet, dignified affairs.

41:34.622 --> 41:38.501
I'd be watching the TV,
I'd feel a shit come on...

41:40.962 --> 41:42.880
[audience laughing]

41:45.591 --> 41:47.719
I'd leave to the bathroom...

41:51.681 --> 41:53.224
I'd have my shit,

41:53.307 --> 41:55.685
I'd come back into the living room,

41:55.768 --> 41:57.687
and nine times out of ten,

41:57.770 --> 42:00.648
I wouldn't even tell anyone
where I'd been.

42:00.732 --> 42:02.525
[audience laughing]

42:04.944 --> 42:07.905
But then, my shits
became like family events.

42:12.035 --> 42:13.995
I'd feel a shit come on...

42:16.664 --> 42:18.458
"All right, everyone!

42:20.793 --> 42:23.212
Daddy's got a shit in the chamber!

42:24.797 --> 42:28.134
Who wants to come
and see a professional at work?"

42:31.179 --> 42:34.098
Anyway, I chickened out of it
for like two weeks.

42:34.182 --> 42:36.934
I wouldn't shit in front of Hank.
Then, I got the guts.

42:37.018 --> 42:39.562
So me and Kate are watching TV.
The TV is there. We're on the couch.

42:39.645 --> 42:41.689
Hank's over there playing with his toys.

42:41.773 --> 42:43.024
And I feel a shit come on.

42:44.150 --> 42:45.860
[audience chuckling]

42:49.030 --> 42:50.490
"I've got one."

42:52.575 --> 42:56.204
And she said, "I think it's time."

42:56.287 --> 42:57.580
[whispers] "Okay."

43:08.883 --> 43:10.301
[normal voice] "G'day, mate.

43:12.470 --> 43:14.388
You're coming with me."

43:23.898 --> 43:27.360
And we went into the toilet,
and I shut the door,

43:27.443 --> 43:29.946
and I pulled me pants
and me underwear down.

43:30.029 --> 43:32.198
Now, he knew it wasn't a normal day.

43:32.281 --> 43:33.866
[audience laughing]

43:37.203 --> 43:39.831
He looked very upset.

43:39.914 --> 43:41.749
And I'm fucking autistic.

43:42.667 --> 43:45.503
[scattered applause]

43:46.212 --> 43:49.006
Neither of us were making eye contact.
We were both...

43:56.013 --> 43:58.057
So I thought,
"I better get down to business."

43:58.141 --> 44:01.102
And I looked at him, I said,
"Oh, all right, son...

44:02.687 --> 44:04.480
first things first.

44:04.564 --> 44:07.650
You gotta tuck your cock and balls
between your legs

44:07.733 --> 44:10.570
so that your penis is facing downwards.

44:10.653 --> 44:14.407
Because where there is poo,
there will always be wee.

44:17.618 --> 44:20.621
Now, because you're a Jefferies,

44:20.705 --> 44:24.458
we don't have
what they call 'big penises.'

44:24.542 --> 44:26.210
[audience laughing]

44:28.754 --> 44:32.675
So, what you do is, you put your legs
a little bit together like that...

44:34.218 --> 44:36.971
to stop your penis from popping back up.

44:39.140 --> 44:41.851
[chuckles] You're seeing it, aren't you?
Yeah.

44:41.934 --> 44:44.520
You see how I look like Mummy now?
Yeah, yeah."

44:44.604 --> 44:46.063
[audience laughing]

44:46.147 --> 44:48.941
Yeah, it's funny, isn't it? It's funny.
Yeah, yeah.

44:49.025 --> 44:51.193
You don't know
what I do for a living, son.

44:51.277 --> 44:54.488
You don't know, but I tell jokes.
I write jokes, you know.

44:54.572 --> 44:57.783
It's always upset me that
no matter how hard I try,

44:57.867 --> 44:59.785
I'll never write anything as funny

44:59.869 --> 45:03.748
as a man putting his cock and balls
between his legs...

45:03.831 --> 45:07.084
and saying, 'I'm a lady, I'm a lady.'

45:09.921 --> 45:12.840
In fact, if you're ever at a party

45:12.924 --> 45:15.384
and you feel like
things aren't going your way...

45:17.303 --> 45:20.264
get behind a tree
and take your pants and underwear off,

45:20.348 --> 45:22.183
tuck your cock and balls
between your legs,

45:22.266 --> 45:24.852
and jump out at a woman and go,
'I'm a lady!' Like that."

45:24.936 --> 45:27.063
[laughing]

45:27.146 --> 45:28.981
Yeah, yeah, it's good. See?

45:29.065 --> 45:33.152
Well, you know, you'll make more friends
than you'll lose."

45:33.235 --> 45:35.154
[audience laughing]

45:37.657 --> 45:39.283
Now...

45:39.367 --> 45:43.496
over the course
of the last six to eight months,

45:43.579 --> 45:46.749
[stammers] my career
has changed somewhat.

45:46.832 --> 45:49.460
Audiences have definitely changed.

45:49.543 --> 45:52.505
It used to just be white guys
the same age as me.

45:52.588 --> 45:55.633
Now, if you look around,
it's pretty 50-50, men and women.

45:55.716 --> 45:58.594
Age groups, races... It's all changed.

45:58.678 --> 46:02.890
And all because
of the gun control routine.

46:02.974 --> 46:04.642
So the gun control routine...

46:04.725 --> 46:06.519
[audience cheering]

46:08.688 --> 46:09.897
got...

46:09.981 --> 46:12.400
got seen on so many different platforms,

46:12.483 --> 46:15.236
and all this stuff,
put up and taken down...

46:15.319 --> 46:17.321
that it's actually been seen
five times more

46:17.405 --> 46:19.448
than anything else I've done in my career.

46:19.532 --> 46:21.909
So I'm mostly known for that now.

46:21.993 --> 46:24.704
Which is strange,
'cause people are coming onto the shows

46:24.787 --> 46:27.832
'cause you're hoping
that I'll do some political satire,

46:27.915 --> 46:32.128
or some social commentary
or something Carlinesque...

46:32.211 --> 46:37.466
and how disappointing
this evening's performance must be.

46:39.385 --> 46:42.304
I just did 25 minutes on pooing.

46:42.388 --> 46:43.931
[audience laughing]

46:45.683 --> 46:50.604
Now, the gun control routine
has been shown in most news outlets.

46:50.730 --> 46:53.441
It was shown in the <i>New Yorker</i>
as an article.

46:53.524 --> 46:56.527
It was shown in the <i>Washington Post</i>
as an article.

46:56.610 --> 46:59.739
It was shown on CNN as news.

47:01.741 --> 47:05.536
And it was shown on Fox
for different reasons.

47:05.619 --> 47:07.455
[audience laughing]

47:10.374 --> 47:16.130
It's also been... it's also now shown to
the law students in Yale.

47:16.213 --> 47:19.967
Like they're meant to learn something
or some shit.

47:20.051 --> 47:23.137
Now, I appreciate all these things.
It's very nice.

47:23.220 --> 47:26.766
I don't know if I deserve these accolades,
or whatever the fuck they're called,

47:26.849 --> 47:29.560
because, I'm gonna be honest with you...

47:29.643 --> 47:30.686
Um...

47:31.645 --> 47:33.814
I made some of the statistics up.

47:33.898 --> 47:35.232
All right!

47:41.072 --> 47:43.699
[stammering] This isn't real.

47:44.742 --> 47:46.368
Now, I made two things up.

47:46.452 --> 47:49.455
Now, I stand by everything I said
in the gun control routine,

47:49.538 --> 47:51.624
because most of the things I said
were common sense

47:51.707 --> 47:53.584
about safes and the guns in Australia,

47:53.667 --> 47:54.668
and that was correct.

47:54.752 --> 47:56.921
I made two statistics up. Two little ones.

47:57.004 --> 47:58.798
So, I'm gonna fess up right now.

47:58.881 --> 48:01.008
The first one is this.

48:01.092 --> 48:06.472
"If you have a gun, you're 80% more likely
to be shot by a gun."

48:06.555 --> 48:08.307
I don't know, maybe.

48:08.390 --> 48:10.184
[audience laughing]

48:12.645 --> 48:15.272
That sounds like a thing, doesn't it?

48:16.565 --> 48:19.944
And the other one was, uh...

48:20.027 --> 48:23.030
"The average security guard
in America earns $16 an hour.

48:23.114 --> 48:26.826
Not a lot of wiggle room
to be a fucking hero."

48:26.909 --> 48:29.703
It turns out that
the average security guard in America

48:29.787 --> 48:31.914
earns $14 an hour.

48:32.832 --> 48:36.168
I'd like to apologize for those extra $2.

48:39.547 --> 48:43.676
Now, it's very weird 'cause,
over the course of my 15-year career,

48:43.759 --> 48:45.970
I've said horrible things about religion.

48:46.053 --> 48:48.139
That if you are religious,
you believe in God,

48:48.222 --> 48:50.224
that you've wasted your life.

48:50.307 --> 48:56.355
And over the course of 15 years,
from religious groups,

48:56.438 --> 49:00.276
I have received seven pieces of hate mail.

49:01.944 --> 49:04.196
Seven.

49:04.280 --> 49:05.865
Very manageable.

49:05.948 --> 49:07.825
[audience laughing]

49:08.909 --> 49:10.995
I write back.

49:16.959 --> 49:20.796
And I thought that religious people
were the nuttiest cunts on the planet.

49:20.880 --> 49:26.385
And that was until I gave my opinion
on the Second Amendment.

49:26.468 --> 49:28.262
Fuck me.

49:28.345 --> 49:30.055
[audience laughing]

49:31.682 --> 49:33.559
I had no idea what crazy was

49:33.642 --> 49:38.022
[chuckling] until I fucking just poked
that hornet's nest with a stick.

49:38.105 --> 49:40.274
[grunts] "I got something to say."

49:43.360 --> 49:46.363
Because on a quiet day,

49:46.447 --> 49:50.701
I receive 20 to 40 pieces of hate mail
from gun people.

49:50.784 --> 49:53.579
On a quiet day. Keep up.

49:53.662 --> 49:55.998
- I, uh...
- [audience laughing]

49:57.333 --> 49:58.375
[scoffs]

49:59.293 --> 50:02.254
Twenty to forty pieces of hate mail,
and it's always the same.

50:02.338 --> 50:05.257
They always read exactly the same way,
etcetera.

50:05.341 --> 50:07.927
Now, I'm in a unique position.

50:08.010 --> 50:10.804
Because of the hate mail
that I receive on a daily basis,

50:10.888 --> 50:14.058
because I've become
the pinup boy for gun control...

50:14.141 --> 50:17.186
I can tell you, down to the hour,

50:17.269 --> 50:21.649
when an American gun owner is happy
and when they're sad.

50:22.650 --> 50:25.319
'Cause they don't send me hate mail
when they're sad.

50:25.402 --> 50:27.655
Like, when there's a massacre
in a school,

50:27.738 --> 50:30.449
it's a very quiet day for me.

50:30.532 --> 50:33.035
Or some 4-year-old
shoots their mum in the head,

50:33.118 --> 50:36.372
they're like, [mumbling]
"I'm not gonna write anything today."

50:37.539 --> 50:40.876
But the day that I received
the most amount of hate mail,

50:40.960 --> 50:44.838
when I received 782 pieces of hate mail,

50:44.922 --> 50:47.758
and it kind of sickened me a bit
when it happened,

50:47.841 --> 50:53.305
was the day of the Paris shootings,
where 128 people died.

50:53.389 --> 50:57.935
And that,
to a real fanatical gun person in America,

50:58.018 --> 51:00.145
that was the best day ever.

51:00.229 --> 51:05.818
They were so happy because
the French have extremely strict gun laws,

51:05.901 --> 51:07.820
and then people went and shot everyone.

51:07.903 --> 51:09.989
And so, I got letters that read like porn,

51:10.072 --> 51:13.117
like they were from <i>Penthouse Forum.</i>

51:13.200 --> 51:17.830
And every letter read the same way.
Like, "See? It happens in every country.

51:17.913 --> 51:19.623
[audience laughing]

51:21.834 --> 51:24.628
It's not just us.
It's not just us.

51:25.546 --> 51:28.632
If they had more guns,
maybe they could've protected themselves."

51:30.426 --> 51:31.969
[audience cheering]

51:34.847 --> 51:37.725
Now, I'm not going
to get into another debate

51:37.808 --> 51:40.102
about whether they had guns
or don't have guns,

51:40.185 --> 51:44.231
'cause this is all... No one knows.
No one was in that situation.

51:44.315 --> 51:49.570
And then, some people went as far to say
that I was a supporter of ISIS.

51:50.404 --> 51:52.406
- Now...
- [audience laughing]

51:54.533 --> 51:56.201
I don't like ISIS.

51:57.786 --> 52:00.539
I hate ISIS as much as the next man.

52:00.622 --> 52:02.374
[loud cheering]

52:02.458 --> 52:03.876
Now...

52:05.711 --> 52:08.255
I'll tell you the problem with ISIS.

52:10.007 --> 52:12.092
The problem with ISIS is...

52:12.176 --> 52:13.510
[audience laughing]

52:15.429 --> 52:16.555
is...

52:20.684 --> 52:23.103
you never see them laughing.

52:23.187 --> 52:26.231
They're not a jovial bunch.
That's what religion does.

52:26.315 --> 52:29.151
Religious people are always miserable.
[groaning]

52:29.234 --> 52:32.112
They're just such miserable cunts,
the ISIS.

52:33.155 --> 52:34.531
You never one of them...

52:34.615 --> 52:37.951
When they do the videos
before a beheading, and the guy is like,

52:38.035 --> 52:41.497
[mock Arabic accent] "Before I behead
this man, a little bit about me...

52:41.580 --> 52:42.998
[audience laughing]

52:44.041 --> 52:45.834
I, well, I like Muhammad.

52:45.918 --> 52:47.503
Oh, shit, fuck!

52:47.586 --> 52:50.756
I love Muhammad.
I love...

52:52.049 --> 52:55.761
I enjoy beheading people, of course.
I like beheading people.

52:55.844 --> 52:59.765
And, uh, I like the comedy of Aziz Ansari.
I like it.

52:59.848 --> 53:01.058
[audience laughing]

53:01.141 --> 53:02.893
I like Aziz.

53:02.976 --> 53:05.813
He's a crazy guy
with modern-day problems."

53:09.691 --> 53:12.945
[normal voice]
Thank fuck the ISIS don't drink!

53:13.028 --> 53:14.738
You don't want drunk ISIS.

53:16.115 --> 53:19.326
You don't want some cunt
waking up with seven heads in his bed,

53:19.410 --> 53:22.162
like, "What the fuck did I do last night?"

53:22.246 --> 53:23.539
[audience laughing]

53:25.040 --> 53:26.500
His friend comes in and goes,

53:26.583 --> 53:30.379
[mock Arabic accent]
"You were so fucked up last night!

53:31.380 --> 53:35.551
We were out drinking,
and by the way, I was joking...

53:35.634 --> 53:37.719
There was some guy doodling on a napkin,

53:37.803 --> 53:40.639
and I was like, 'Hey,
he's drawing Muhammad,'

53:40.722 --> 53:43.308
and you fucking lost your shit, man!"

53:50.482 --> 53:54.027
[normal voice] So... politically,

53:54.111 --> 53:59.283
this country is in a very delicate
situation at the moment.

53:59.366 --> 54:02.161
[chuckling]
It could go either fucking way.

54:02.244 --> 54:04.163
You got... you got two parties.

54:04.246 --> 54:05.873
You got the Democrats and Republicans.

54:05.956 --> 54:09.168
And all they do is talk about
two subjects over and over again.

54:09.251 --> 54:10.752
As long as they
talk about these two subjects,

54:10.836 --> 54:14.756
they're fucking you up the ass with
other things that you don't notice

54:14.840 --> 54:16.592
because you're so fucking...

54:16.675 --> 54:18.719
And the rest of the world
isn't as fixated...

54:18.802 --> 54:23.265
Okay, two subjects.
Abortion, guns. Abortion, guns. Right?

54:23.348 --> 54:25.058
And so, the Democrats,

54:25.142 --> 54:29.354
they wanna have gun restrictions,
and they don't care about abortion.

54:29.480 --> 54:33.192
And the Republicans,
they hate abortion, and they love guns.

54:33.275 --> 54:36.320
And so, we've got a problem here, right?

54:36.403 --> 54:37.779
Because the Democrats are like,

54:37.863 --> 54:42.451
"Come on, you don't need a machine gun,
and you know you don't.

54:42.534 --> 54:46.788
And if your dad fucks you,
you don't have to keep that. That's cool."

54:50.876 --> 54:52.753
[audience cheering]

54:56.298 --> 54:57.925
And the Republicans are like,

54:58.008 --> 55:01.845
"All life is precious,
unless it steps on my property."

55:01.929 --> 55:03.597
[audience laughing]

55:05.390 --> 55:07.184
[audience cheering]

55:12.481 --> 55:14.316
And then...

55:15.526 --> 55:17.319
you got Donald Trump.

55:21.532 --> 55:24.785
Now... every time
I've recorded a special...

55:24.868 --> 55:26.495
The other specials
I've recorded in America

55:26.578 --> 55:29.122
have been in New York,
San Francisco and Boston.

55:29.206 --> 55:32.334
And everyone's called me
a fucking pussy...

55:32.417 --> 55:34.336
with my liberal agenda.

55:35.754 --> 55:38.090
Well, I'm in fucking Nashville right now.

55:38.173 --> 55:39.925
[audience cheering]

55:49.142 --> 55:53.564
And if you wanna shoot me,
now is the perfect time.

55:54.773 --> 55:57.150
[chuckling] There's eight cameras on me.

55:58.402 --> 56:00.153
[audience laughing]

56:00.237 --> 56:01.530
[man whoops]

56:01.613 --> 56:03.907
I think we're good.
I think we're good.

56:03.991 --> 56:06.577
Isn't it sad that the country
has gotten to the stage

56:06.660 --> 56:11.707
that when you buy theater tickets, you go,
"Get ones in the aisle, so we can run"?

56:11.790 --> 56:13.083
Everyone wanted to get the middle.

56:13.166 --> 56:16.295
We're like, "No, you're sitting ducks
in the middle..."

56:19.047 --> 56:20.924
So anyway, Donald Trump.

56:21.008 --> 56:23.093
Now, don't get me wrong.

56:23.176 --> 56:24.845
He's a lot of fun.

56:24.928 --> 56:26.555
[audience laughing]

56:26.638 --> 56:28.932
And there's a little bit of me...

56:29.016 --> 56:33.687
[stuttering]
There's a little bit of me that thinks...

56:33.770 --> 56:35.647
"Fuck it, let's do it.

56:35.731 --> 56:37.441
[audience laughing]

56:40.235 --> 56:43.697
Let's do it and see
how fucking crazy shit can get."

56:43.780 --> 56:45.490
[audience laughing]

56:51.830 --> 56:55.083
Because he's just...
because what happens is,

56:55.167 --> 56:58.170
he says really simple shit
that means nothing,

56:58.253 --> 57:00.797
and then, fucking dummies... right?

57:00.881 --> 57:02.799
If you've ever said this sentence,

57:02.883 --> 57:04.968
"I like him
because he's a straight talker,"

57:05.052 --> 57:06.970
you're as dumb as shit.

57:07.054 --> 57:08.305
[audience laughing]

57:08.388 --> 57:09.723
[audience cheering and applauding]

57:12.601 --> 57:13.810
This...

57:18.857 --> 57:24.738
Just because someone says
something simple that you understand...

57:26.490 --> 57:28.200
doesn't mean they're a straight talker.

57:28.283 --> 57:30.827
You can say a complex thing
and be telling the truth.

57:31.662 --> 57:34.456
But, because he goes,
"I'm gonna make America great again."

57:34.539 --> 57:37.918
And you're like,
"I got every word in that sentence."

57:38.001 --> 57:39.795
[audience laughing]

57:42.089 --> 57:44.424
He's like, "I'm gonna build a wall."

57:44.508 --> 57:46.426
"I have a wall at home.

57:51.139 --> 57:53.183
You're a straight talker."

57:55.185 --> 57:58.313
And then he just says shit...

57:58.397 --> 58:01.191
that... it won't happen.

58:01.274 --> 58:04.361
"Gonna build a wall
and Mexico's gonna pay for it."

58:06.989 --> 58:10.450
Who... I haven't heard a Mexican yet go,
"Ah, yeah, we got this."

58:10.534 --> 58:12.911
What are you talking about?

58:12.995 --> 58:16.665
What the fuck are you talking about?
That's just saying shit.

58:16.748 --> 58:19.835
He's like a kid running
for class president,

58:19.918 --> 58:24.047
who's just walking around, going,
"And we're gonna have two lunches.

58:25.215 --> 58:27.426
- And...
- [audience cheering]

58:31.138 --> 58:35.434
there's gonna be a soda machine
in every classroom.

58:35.517 --> 58:37.686
Nashville football rules!"

58:43.275 --> 58:45.527
But here's where it doesn't get fun.

58:46.445 --> 58:48.155
And that's all. It's good fun.

58:48.238 --> 58:50.949
But here's where it's not fun, right?

58:51.033 --> 58:54.911
What he does is, he preys on fear.
As soon as he...

58:54.995 --> 58:58.665
In the beginning, it was, "Oh, Mexicans,
they're coming over and raping."

58:58.749 --> 59:01.501
And then there was a terrorist attack,
and he went,

59:01.585 --> 59:02.836
"Oh, fuck, I'll go after the Muslims.

59:02.919 --> 59:04.796
We should kill the families of Muslims."

59:04.880 --> 59:07.716
Which, by the way,
you're not allowed to do.

59:08.633 --> 59:11.970
And then he started saying,
after the Paris attacks,

59:12.054 --> 59:15.265
"We should put every Muslim on a register,

59:15.348 --> 59:17.809
and we shouldn't let more refugees
come from Syria,

59:17.893 --> 59:21.438
and the Muslims that live here
on a register..."

59:21.521 --> 59:25.358
[stutters] That means ISIS win.

59:25.442 --> 59:29.821
As soon as he says that,
ISIS have fucking won.

59:29.905 --> 59:33.241
Right? Because their plan
to shoot people in Paris,

59:33.325 --> 59:35.077
that's not their end plan.

59:35.160 --> 59:38.413
They didn't kill 128 people and go,
"Ah, well, that's done."

59:38.497 --> 59:39.623
You know what I mean?

59:39.706 --> 59:41.958
It's a recruitment tool.

59:42.042 --> 59:47.589
And the recruitment tool
can only work if hate is bred.

59:47.672 --> 59:50.634
Right? What he does is, he says,
"Oh, we're gonna ban them.

59:50.717 --> 59:51.885
We're not gonna let more in the country.

59:51.968 --> 59:53.303
The ones here have to be on a register."

59:53.386 --> 59:57.099
Now, you're a 16-year-old boy or girl
that's a Muslim living in this country.

59:57.182 --> 59:59.684
You've lived your entire life
in this country.

59:59.768 --> 01:00:02.104
You've always
considered yourself American.

01:00:02.187 --> 01:00:05.524
Then all of a sudden,
someone who could be your president says

01:00:05.607 --> 01:00:10.237
you are not welcome here
and that you should be put on a register.

01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:11.363
Now, that kid...

01:00:11.446 --> 01:00:15.075
How fucking quickly do you think
that kid could be radicalized now?

01:00:15.158 --> 01:00:17.494
Before, he wasn't gonna be
radicalized at all.

01:00:17.577 --> 01:00:19.412
[audience cheering and applauding]

01:00:24.709 --> 01:00:27.087
So what he's trying to do is,

01:00:27.170 --> 01:00:31.174
he's trying to defeat hate with hate.

01:00:31.258 --> 01:00:32.968
And hate doesn't beat hate.

01:00:33.051 --> 01:00:36.096
It's never fucking beaten hate.
It just makes more hate.

01:00:36.179 --> 01:00:40.392
Now, this might be the most hippie thing
that ever comes out of my mouth...

01:00:42.269 --> 01:00:45.355
but it's true.
The only thing that can beat hate is love.

01:00:45.438 --> 01:00:49.776
- Now, love doesn't always beat hate, eh?
- [audience cheering]

01:00:50.861 --> 01:00:54.614
It doesn't always beat hate,
but it does do something. Right?

01:00:54.698 --> 01:00:57.200
Now, think about your own personal life.

01:00:57.284 --> 01:01:00.203
Think about a person who hates you
and you hate them.

01:01:00.287 --> 01:01:02.873
From now on,
just show that person nothing but love.

01:01:02.956 --> 01:01:05.709
I'm not saying that
that person will start loving you.

01:01:05.792 --> 01:01:08.128
They'll probably still fucking hate you.

01:01:09.045 --> 01:01:10.463
But one thing will happen.

01:01:10.547 --> 01:01:13.800
Eventually, everyone will see them
as the asshole.

01:01:15.218 --> 01:01:18.346
Don't be the asshole, America.
Don't be the asshole.

01:01:18.430 --> 01:01:20.140
[audience cheering and applauding]

01:01:24.853 --> 01:01:30.775
So... to summarize,
you can only beat hate with love.

01:01:30.859 --> 01:01:33.904
Now, in saying that, I hate Muslims.

01:01:33.987 --> 01:01:35.614
[audience laughing]

01:01:37.199 --> 01:01:39.868
Hang on, hang on.
I didn't finish me sentence.

01:01:40.869 --> 01:01:42.621
I hate Muslims, Christians,

01:01:42.704 --> 01:01:46.583
I hate the Amish, Buddhists,
the snake people, Jews.

01:01:46.666 --> 01:01:50.545
I don't know who I've missed here.
Sikhs. I hate all.

01:01:52.672 --> 01:01:55.884
Our fight in this world
is not against Islam,

01:01:55.967 --> 01:01:57.469
it's against religion.

01:01:57.552 --> 01:02:00.430
- Be very clear about this.
- [audience cheering]

01:02:04.059 --> 01:02:06.895
'Cause I can tell you this for sure.

01:02:06.978 --> 01:02:11.942
No one's head has ever been cut off
in the name of atheism.

01:02:12.025 --> 01:02:15.820
No one has ever cut into human flesh,

01:02:15.904 --> 01:02:20.450
and looked on camera and gone,
"In the name of nothing!"

01:02:20.533 --> 01:02:22.410
[audience laughing]

01:02:24.371 --> 01:02:26.248
[audience cheering]

01:02:31.127 --> 01:02:34.589
Now, let me be clear about this.
If you're religious...

01:02:34.673 --> 01:02:37.926
Some of you might be very nice,
but you're slowing us down.

01:02:38.009 --> 01:02:39.928
[audience laughing]

01:02:40.011 --> 01:02:44.266
We're trying to move forward,
and you're in the fucking way. I'm sorry.

01:02:44.349 --> 01:02:48.561
See, there's a lie that you'll be told
throughout your life

01:02:48.645 --> 01:02:50.647
that will go along
the lines of this...

01:02:50.730 --> 01:02:51.982
"We have to save the planet."

01:02:52.065 --> 01:02:54.359
There's no bigger lie than
"we have to save the planet."

01:02:54.442 --> 01:02:58.655
We don't have to save the planet.
We have to save us, the human race.

01:02:58.738 --> 01:03:01.992
The planet does not give a fuck about us,

01:03:02.075 --> 01:03:04.661
and it will be happy when we're gone.

01:03:04.744 --> 01:03:06.121
[audience laughing]

01:03:06.204 --> 01:03:08.206
We are in the planet's way.

01:03:08.290 --> 01:03:10.083
Have you seen those documentaries
where they go,

01:03:10.166 --> 01:03:12.919
"This is what New York will look like
one year after the human race dies,"

01:03:13.003 --> 01:03:15.088
and it's all covered in vines and shit?

01:03:15.171 --> 01:03:16.423
The planet wants us gone.

01:03:16.506 --> 01:03:20.593
As soon as we're gone, the planet will go,
"I'm gonna do dinosaurs again."

01:03:20.677 --> 01:03:22.178
Right? Like...

01:03:27.934 --> 01:03:29.561
So we have to save ourselves

01:03:29.644 --> 01:03:32.689
in spite of the planet
trying to kick us the fuck off.

01:03:32.772 --> 01:03:33.815
Right?

01:03:33.898 --> 01:03:35.650
Now, imagine that...

01:03:37.444 --> 01:03:40.905
the world is a train track
and society is a train.

01:03:40.989 --> 01:03:44.367
As society has always had to do,
the train has to move forward.

01:03:44.451 --> 01:03:46.119
'Cause if it stops moving forward,

01:03:46.202 --> 01:03:48.538
we'll run out of resources
around the train

01:03:48.621 --> 01:03:50.040
'cause we'll be stationary.

01:03:50.123 --> 01:03:54.002
And the gears will lock up,
and the vines will take over.

01:03:54.085 --> 01:03:55.628
So it has to keep going forward.

01:03:55.712 --> 01:03:56.963
Now, in this train,

01:03:57.047 --> 01:04:00.675
we have the people in the engine room,
who are running the show.

01:04:00.759 --> 01:04:04.471
And those people in our society
who run the show are scientists.

01:04:04.554 --> 01:04:06.139
These are the people inventing

01:04:06.222 --> 01:04:10.018
medicines for you to live longer,
and surgeries for you to live longer

01:04:10.101 --> 01:04:13.480
and finding alternative fuel sources.

01:04:13.563 --> 01:04:17.108
And engineers that are making machines
that run more efficiently.

01:04:17.192 --> 01:04:19.152
Right? Now,
all those people are scientists.

01:04:19.235 --> 01:04:24.866
Now, whether you like it or not,
scientists are primarily atheists.

01:04:24.949 --> 01:04:27.786
And they're in the front carriage,
dragging us along.

01:04:27.869 --> 01:04:30.121
Now, in the second carriage,

01:04:30.205 --> 01:04:34.501
we have a bunch of cunts that
I don't think get fucking enough flak.

01:04:36.086 --> 01:04:37.420
Agnostics.

01:04:38.546 --> 01:04:40.882
These fucking wishy-washy fucks.

01:04:40.965 --> 01:04:42.842
[audience laughing]

01:04:45.595 --> 01:04:49.808
They're all standing around
in the second carriage, going, "Who knows?

01:04:51.267 --> 01:04:53.770
Maybe there is a god.
Maybe there isn't a god.

01:04:53.853 --> 01:04:56.898
Maybe your god and your god
are the same god, but...

01:04:56.981 --> 01:05:00.235
I know there was a Big Bang,
but who made the Big Bang?

01:05:00.318 --> 01:05:04.656
I wouldn't consider myself, you know,
religious, but I am spiritual."

01:05:04.739 --> 01:05:05.907
And...

01:05:07.534 --> 01:05:09.327
then there's this last carriage,

01:05:09.411 --> 01:05:13.748
and the last carriage is 50 times bigger
than the other two carriages combined.

01:05:13.832 --> 01:05:18.336
And it's carrying the rest
of the population of the human race.

01:05:18.420 --> 01:05:22.048
And it's filled with cunts
wearing hats for reasons they don't know

01:05:22.132 --> 01:05:25.427
and growing beards
because they think they have to.

01:05:25.510 --> 01:05:28.388
Some of the women are covering their faces
and cowering.

01:05:28.471 --> 01:05:31.933
Everyone's dancing around going,
"Man on a cloud. Man on a cloud."

01:05:32.016 --> 01:05:38.398
And there are so many of these cunts
that the train is hardly fucking moving!

01:05:40.233 --> 01:05:43.153
And the people in the engine room
are like this...

01:05:43.903 --> 01:05:47.615
[sighing]
"If I just pull this peg here...

01:05:47.699 --> 01:05:48.783
[audience laughing]

01:05:48.867 --> 01:05:50.410
[inaudible]

01:05:55.707 --> 01:05:59.169
do you know how fast we'd be moving?"
[chuckles]

01:06:01.171 --> 01:06:05.216
Oh, well... I'm not gonna change
people's opinions, I guess.

01:06:05.300 --> 01:06:06.968
I don't fucking...

01:06:10.513 --> 01:06:12.599
Now...

01:06:12.682 --> 01:06:14.893
with the hate mail
that I get from the guns,

01:06:14.976 --> 01:06:16.686
they always start the same way.

01:06:16.769 --> 01:06:18.188
It always makes me laugh.

01:06:18.271 --> 01:06:22.609
Every letter starts with, "Hey, buddy,
you shouldn't even say anything.

01:06:22.692 --> 01:06:24.527
You're not from here."

01:06:24.611 --> 01:06:25.778
[audience laughing]

01:06:28.490 --> 01:06:30.200
That is the weakest argument ever.

01:06:30.283 --> 01:06:35.205
Okay, as Americans, from now on,
don't use that argument. All right?

01:06:35.288 --> 01:06:37.332
Because you're Americans.

01:06:37.415 --> 01:06:41.544
It's not like, historically,
you've kept your opinions to yourself.

01:06:43.588 --> 01:06:46.508
It's not like I've ever been
in a party in the UK

01:06:46.591 --> 01:06:48.593
and there's an American guy there,
and I've heard this sentence,

01:06:48.676 --> 01:06:49.928
"Jeez, he's a quiet chap."

01:06:50.011 --> 01:06:51.721
[audience laughing]

01:06:53.306 --> 01:06:56.142
[chuckling]
You're the loudest people on Earth, so...

01:06:58.186 --> 01:07:03.024
And then they always say this,
and this fucking spins me out.

01:07:03.107 --> 01:07:06.778
"Well, I don't expect an Australian
to understand freedom."

01:07:06.861 --> 01:07:08.696
[audience laughing]

01:07:11.533 --> 01:07:14.327
What are you talking about?

01:07:14.410 --> 01:07:17.455
You constantly say "freedom" all the time,
like you're...

01:07:17.539 --> 01:07:20.542
"Oh, we're so free. We fight for freedom.
Freedom.

01:07:20.625 --> 01:07:24.003
Come to the freedom lounge
at the airport." Like, fucking what?

01:07:24.087 --> 01:07:27.257
You know when you're singing
the national anthem at the baseball

01:07:27.340 --> 01:07:31.302
and the person holds the note "free"
a little bit longer than they should,

01:07:31.386 --> 01:07:35.139
until all you Americans
fucking come in your pants?

01:07:38.643 --> 01:07:42.814
<i>♪ For the land of the free ♪</i>

01:07:42.897 --> 01:07:44.232
[grunting]

01:07:44.315 --> 01:07:46.109
[audience laughing]

01:07:47.652 --> 01:07:49.195
"We're so free."

01:07:54.075 --> 01:07:56.411
Freedom this, freedom that,
free, free, free.

01:07:56.494 --> 01:08:01.416
Now, I hate to break it to you,
'cause I don't think you know this.

01:08:03.251 --> 01:08:04.794
[sighing]

01:08:04.877 --> 01:08:08.506
There are 92 free countries on the planet.

01:08:08.590 --> 01:08:10.466
Democratic, free countries.

01:08:10.550 --> 01:08:13.344
You are one of them.

01:08:13.428 --> 01:08:18.015
Every single English-speaking country
on Earth is free,

01:08:18.099 --> 01:08:21.685
and most of the [clicks tongue]
countries are also free.

01:08:21.769 --> 01:08:23.479
[audience laughing and applauding]

01:08:27.024 --> 01:08:29.402
Now, you're very free.

01:08:30.194 --> 01:08:31.779
Don't get upset.

01:08:33.615 --> 01:08:36.242
And I have a wonderful...
I love America. I truly do.

01:08:36.326 --> 01:08:38.828
I live here and love it.
I have nothing against...

01:08:38.911 --> 01:08:42.122
And none of the things
I'm about to mention affect you...

01:08:42.206 --> 01:08:45.460
affect me in any way, right?

01:08:45.542 --> 01:08:48.171
You may not be the freest place on Earth.

01:08:49.171 --> 01:08:51.090
[audience laughing]

01:08:53.343 --> 01:08:55.094
Just a quick example,

01:08:55.178 --> 01:08:58.805
out of the 92 free countries
on the planet,

01:08:58.890 --> 01:09:01.975
you have the highest rate
of incarceration.

01:09:02.060 --> 01:09:04.895
One percent of your adult population
is in prison.

01:09:04.979 --> 01:09:09.484
That's double that of the country that
comes in second, which is South Africa.

01:09:09.567 --> 01:09:13.279
If you've ever been to South Africa,
South Africa is fucked.

01:09:13.363 --> 01:09:15.323
[audience laughing]

01:09:15.406 --> 01:09:18.701
So you're double that of South Africa.

01:09:18.785 --> 01:09:23.122
[chuckling] So, statistically,
in the land of the free,

01:09:23.206 --> 01:09:26.000
you have the least amount of free people.

01:09:26.084 --> 01:09:27.877
[audience laughing]

01:09:34.759 --> 01:09:39.805
Now, this is a super simple one.
Super simple argument.

01:09:39.889 --> 01:09:42.015
In Holland,

01:09:42.100 --> 01:09:46.437
you can smoke weed whilst fucking a hooker

01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:48.231
in front of a cop.

01:09:48.314 --> 01:09:50.316
[audience laughing]

01:09:51.693 --> 01:09:55.196
How dare Holland not be called
the land of the free?

01:09:56.864 --> 01:10:00.201
Do you honestly think
you're competing with Holland?

01:10:03.496 --> 01:10:05.039
In Canada,

01:10:05.123 --> 01:10:09.419
just last year, they legalized
assisted suicide for the sick,

01:10:09.502 --> 01:10:12.213
which, I believe,
is the biggest freedom of them all.

01:10:12.296 --> 01:10:13.423
It's your life.

01:10:13.506 --> 01:10:17.093
No government, no religious group
should ever tell you...

01:10:17.176 --> 01:10:18.803
[audience cheering and applauding]

01:10:20.138 --> 01:10:22.265
when you get to check out.

01:10:23.433 --> 01:10:26.352
If you're a pro-life person, good.

01:10:26.436 --> 01:10:30.148
Do it with your life, not mine. Right?

01:10:30.231 --> 01:10:32.692
- Now...
- [audience cheering and applauding]

01:10:32.775 --> 01:10:33.818
'Cause...

01:10:33.901 --> 01:10:35.570
Also, I don't think
they've thought about it.

01:10:35.653 --> 01:10:39.449
I don't think there's even
the most evangelical Christian,

01:10:39.532 --> 01:10:43.327
who's a burn victim, just hanging
on to life support in a hospital, just...

01:10:43.411 --> 01:10:44.662
[gasping]

01:10:44.746 --> 01:10:45.830
"I feel so free."

01:10:48.249 --> 01:10:50.418
And I'm so glad
they're doing it in Canada,

01:10:50.501 --> 01:10:55.173
because if I ever had an assisted suicide,
I'd want it to be a Canadian doctor.

01:10:56.674 --> 01:10:58.760
I want some guy
rocking up to my house like,

01:10:58.843 --> 01:11:01.304
[mock Canadian accent]
"Okay. All righty, then...

01:11:03.014 --> 01:11:06.225
So I hear that someone's
given up on life, eh?

01:11:07.977 --> 01:11:11.481
All right, let me set up my little
death machine here, and I'll...

01:11:11.564 --> 01:11:15.026
I'm gonna put this in your vein,
and you're gonna be so sleepy so soon.

01:11:15.109 --> 01:11:16.194
I tell you what, there."

01:11:16.277 --> 01:11:17.862
[audience laughing]

01:11:22.366 --> 01:11:27.872
In Australia, maybe 20 years ago,
they legalized prostitution.

01:11:27.955 --> 01:11:31.375
They thought it'd be the downfall
of our society, but it wasn't.

01:11:31.459 --> 01:11:33.252
It was a great thing.
In Sydney, where I grew up,

01:11:33.336 --> 01:11:36.005
the streets always had hookers
walking around,

01:11:36.088 --> 01:11:39.300
there was needles, and it was
a very seedy city in some parts.

01:11:39.383 --> 01:11:41.594
And then they legalized prostitution.

01:11:41.677 --> 01:11:43.805
They moved all the hookers into brothels.

01:11:43.888 --> 01:11:47.934
And because they moved into brothels,
all the girls had to be tested for STDs.

01:11:48.017 --> 01:11:51.312
And then, the guys,
they could see the tests as they go in,

01:11:51.395 --> 01:11:52.730
so it was safer for the men.

01:11:52.814 --> 01:11:54.273
But it was also safer for the women

01:11:54.357 --> 01:11:56.484
'cause they put security
in these brothels.

01:11:56.567 --> 01:11:58.861
So if you showed up like a drunk idiot,
they wouldn't let you in.

01:11:58.945 --> 01:12:01.113
Or if you got aggro,
they'd kick you the fuck out.

01:12:01.197 --> 01:12:03.282
So the girls were safer,
the men were safer.

01:12:03.366 --> 01:12:06.953
Human trafficking was all but eliminated.

01:12:07.036 --> 01:12:10.414
And tax revenue went up.

01:12:10.498 --> 01:12:13.376
And the divorce rate dropped by 8%.

01:12:13.459 --> 01:12:15.211
[audience laughing]

01:12:16.879 --> 01:12:20.633
There is no downside
to legalized prostitution.

01:12:20.716 --> 01:12:24.762
Now, in America,
prostitution is illegal...

01:12:24.846 --> 01:12:26.514
unless you film it.

01:12:28.349 --> 01:12:32.228
How is that possible?
How the fuck is that possible?

01:12:32.311 --> 01:12:35.523
How do you have
the biggest porn industry in the world,

01:12:35.606 --> 01:12:37.567
and you still have illegal prostitution?

01:12:37.650 --> 01:12:40.319
Because it is legal
to pay a woman for sex,

01:12:40.403 --> 01:12:43.155
but your friend Dave
has to be in the corner with a camera.

01:12:43.239 --> 01:12:44.198
[audience laughing]

01:12:44.282 --> 01:12:46.117
And Dave has to film it.

01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:48.578
And Dave has to promise
to put it on the Internet,

01:12:48.661 --> 01:12:50.496
'cause if Dave doesn't,

01:12:50.580 --> 01:12:52.999
then a crime has been committed.

01:12:53.082 --> 01:12:56.335
And that girl can be 18 years old.

01:12:56.419 --> 01:13:00.131
And then, she can be surrounded
by ten men that she barely knows,

01:13:00.214 --> 01:13:02.884
and they can all jack off onto her face

01:13:02.967 --> 01:13:05.261
until she's glazed with come.

01:13:05.344 --> 01:13:07.305
[audience laughing]

01:13:07.388 --> 01:13:10.308
And no crime has been committed.

01:13:11.642 --> 01:13:16.314
But in America, and only in America,

01:13:16.397 --> 01:13:18.691
she's too young to have a beer.

01:13:20.735 --> 01:13:23.613
If anyone deserves a beer...

01:13:23.696 --> 01:13:25.197
[audience cheering and applauding]

01:13:25.281 --> 01:13:29.702
in the land of the free,
the home of the brave...

01:13:30.703 --> 01:13:33.789
it's the girl
with ten loads of come on her face.

01:13:34.832 --> 01:13:37.293
In fact, if you have
ten loads of come on your face,

01:13:37.376 --> 01:13:39.629
you should get free drinks
wherever you go.

01:13:39.712 --> 01:13:41.297
[audience laughing]

01:13:41.380 --> 01:13:43.466
You seem like a fun girl...

01:13:44.675 --> 01:13:46.802
or a heavy sleeper.

01:13:46.886 --> 01:13:48.638
[audience laughing]

01:13:55.186 --> 01:13:56.938
Now...

01:13:57.063 --> 01:13:58.606
before I go...

01:14:00.066 --> 01:14:01.651
[sniffs] Um...

01:14:03.235 --> 01:14:05.780
My son turned three,

01:14:05.863 --> 01:14:09.659
and my girlfriend made me
write him a letter on his third birthday

01:14:09.742 --> 01:14:11.535
for him to open when he was 18.

01:14:11.619 --> 01:14:13.871
I don't know fucking why.

01:14:13.955 --> 01:14:16.624
You know when chicks go,
"You need to do this thing"?

01:14:16.707 --> 01:14:19.627
I'm like, "Why?

01:14:19.710 --> 01:14:22.421
I have 15 years. Why?"

01:14:22.505 --> 01:14:24.840
But I did it, you know.
So I wrote the letter.

01:14:24.924 --> 01:14:28.010
And I'm really bad
at writing things on paper.

01:14:28.094 --> 01:14:31.764
I've got terrible handwriting.
I'm basically illiterate and a fucking...

01:14:32.848 --> 01:14:34.225
And so, I'm like,

01:14:34.308 --> 01:14:38.354
"Dear Hank, so you're a man now.

01:14:38.437 --> 01:14:41.399
I'm sure you've made me very proud.

01:14:41.482 --> 01:14:44.860
Unless, of course,
you're a drug addict or something.

01:14:45.861 --> 01:14:49.490
Come to think of it,
there are many ways to disappoint me.

01:14:52.952 --> 01:14:56.539
Who knows?
I might be dead by now.

01:14:56.622 --> 01:15:00.251
Or you might be dead,
and I'm reading this whilst crying."

01:15:00.334 --> 01:15:02.128
[audience laughing]

01:15:06.048 --> 01:15:07.216
I, um...

01:15:08.217 --> 01:15:10.761
So, I'm writing the letter,
I just... I thought,

01:15:10.845 --> 01:15:14.348
"Little life tips,
things that you should do in life."

01:15:14.432 --> 01:15:16.600
So the next thing I wrote was this.

01:15:16.684 --> 01:15:19.520
"A wise man once said,

01:15:19.603 --> 01:15:21.605
'Try not to be a cunt.'"

01:15:25.109 --> 01:15:26.610
[audience cheering]

01:15:31.365 --> 01:15:34.618
And then, I just gave him
little bits of advice like,

01:15:34.702 --> 01:15:37.079
"If you get a parking ticket,
pay it right away.

01:15:37.163 --> 01:15:39.665
Don't leave it.
It's a pain in the ass.

01:15:39.749 --> 01:15:42.710
And always love your mum."
And I mean this.

01:15:42.793 --> 01:15:47.214
If my son's watching this at 18 right now,
watching me perform...

01:15:47.298 --> 01:15:52.470
No person has ever loved you
more than your mother loves you,

01:15:52.553 --> 01:15:54.972
so you always be good to that woman.

01:15:55.056 --> 01:15:56.807
- And then...
- [audience cheering and applauding]

01:15:59.727 --> 01:16:01.562
And then, I wrote about...

01:16:01.645 --> 01:16:03.272
I just thought I'd tell him about

01:16:03.355 --> 01:16:05.357
the good and bad things in my life,

01:16:05.441 --> 01:16:08.027
and the things I did well
and didn't do well.

01:16:08.110 --> 01:16:10.237
And I've been very open about this,

01:16:10.321 --> 01:16:12.990
and I feel like by being open about this,
it helps others.

01:16:13.074 --> 01:16:16.202
I don't know, but I've always...

01:16:16.285 --> 01:16:20.247
Fairly severe depression my whole life.
Suicidal at times.

01:16:20.331 --> 01:16:23.501
And, it's a very selfish thing,
depression,

01:16:23.584 --> 01:16:26.879
because I know my life's good
and I can't wrap my brain around it.

01:16:26.962 --> 01:16:29.381
I just... I don't...

01:16:29.465 --> 01:16:31.342
Right now, my brain's going,

01:16:31.425 --> 01:16:34.220
"Maybe this special
isn't as good as the last one."

01:16:35.554 --> 01:16:37.973
And so, I've never really enjoyed success.

01:16:38.057 --> 01:16:41.102
I've never really had pure happiness
like some people do.

01:16:41.185 --> 01:16:43.938
[stutters] I'm such a pessimist.

01:16:44.021 --> 01:16:45.731
When you meet these people who go,

01:16:45.815 --> 01:16:50.152
"You're such a glass-half-empty
sort of guy."

01:16:50.236 --> 01:16:53.364
I'm like,
"These glass-half-full cunts, fuck them."

01:16:53.447 --> 01:16:55.366
[audience laughing]

01:16:55.449 --> 01:16:56.659
You know what I mean?

01:16:56.742 --> 01:16:59.912
I've never met
a successful glass-half-full cunt.

01:16:59.995 --> 01:17:03.249
You'll never be anything
if you think the glass is half full.

01:17:03.332 --> 01:17:04.834
If you want to get ahead,

01:17:04.917 --> 01:17:08.212
walk in the room and go,
"Why isn't that fucking glass full?"

01:17:11.882 --> 01:17:15.219
Anyway, so I thought about
what would make me happy,

01:17:15.302 --> 01:17:18.347
what would've made me happy,
what makes other people happy.

01:17:18.430 --> 01:17:22.768
And so I wrote to him, I said,
"I think the secret to happiness is this.

01:17:25.187 --> 01:17:27.982
The secret to happiness...

01:17:28.065 --> 01:17:29.900
is being good-looking.

01:17:29.984 --> 01:17:31.569
[audience laughing]

01:17:32.736 --> 01:17:36.198
Now, throughout your life,
people will lie to you and say things like

01:17:36.282 --> 01:17:40.035
'kindness,' or 'being good to others,'
or 'family' or some shit."

01:17:41.620 --> 01:17:43.747
[audience laughing]

01:17:43.831 --> 01:17:47.418
The only way to truly be happy
in this world is to be good-looking.

01:17:47.501 --> 01:17:49.587
Now, in this world, we have everything

01:17:49.670 --> 01:17:51.672
from one,
being the ugliest person on Earth,

01:17:51.755 --> 01:17:53.716
to ten,
being the best-looking person on Earth,

01:17:53.799 --> 01:17:56.093
and we have everything in between.

01:17:56.177 --> 01:17:57.261
And there's very few ones,

01:17:57.344 --> 01:17:59.096
very few twos,
and very few threes.

01:17:59.180 --> 01:18:03.267
And four, five, six
is the meat of the bell curve.

01:18:03.350 --> 01:18:06.270
That's where 95% of the population
is average-looking.

01:18:06.353 --> 01:18:08.689
Four, five, six,
and seven, eight, nine, ten.

01:18:08.772 --> 01:18:13.277
Now... I've been looking out
at the audience here.

01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:15.196
[audience laughing]

01:18:15.279 --> 01:18:16.655
Uh...

01:18:16.739 --> 01:18:19.241
Pretty good. Like...
I've spotted an eight.

01:18:20.284 --> 01:18:22.995
Or what they call an LA six.

01:18:23.078 --> 01:18:24.997
- I...
- [audience laughing]

01:18:26.832 --> 01:18:28.542
But, uh...

01:18:28.626 --> 01:18:31.420
I spotted an eight.
That's pretty good in Nashville, man.

01:18:31.503 --> 01:18:33.047
Don't be offended.

01:18:33.130 --> 01:18:35.966
Tens are super rare.

01:18:36.050 --> 01:18:38.719
There's never been a ten
in my audience, ever.

01:18:38.802 --> 01:18:40.804
I don't think tens
come to things like this.

01:18:40.888 --> 01:18:45.184
I think tens are sitting at home
with other tens going, "I'm so happy."

01:18:45.267 --> 01:18:46.936
- Eh?
- [audience laughing]

01:18:51.273 --> 01:18:53.734
And nines are as rare as tens, almost.

01:18:53.817 --> 01:18:55.694
A nine is just an imperfect ten.

01:18:55.778 --> 01:18:58.197
A nine is like a ten with a fucked-up toe.

01:18:58.280 --> 01:19:00.157
[audience laughing]

01:19:02.743 --> 01:19:04.286
So, an eight's pretty good.

01:19:04.370 --> 01:19:07.081
Now, regrettably...

01:19:08.582 --> 01:19:11.710
- there is a two in the audience.
- [audience laughing]

01:19:12.670 --> 01:19:15.089
Now, I'm not gonna point you out.

01:19:15.172 --> 01:19:17.549
- You know who you are.
- [audience laughing]

01:19:21.887 --> 01:19:25.516
There are no ones.
Ones are as rare as tens.

01:19:25.599 --> 01:19:28.686
I've seen about five ones in my life.

01:19:30.145 --> 01:19:33.357
They... Ones don't really leave the house.
They...

01:19:34.775 --> 01:19:37.987
- they know they upset the rest of us.
- [audience laughing]

01:19:39.655 --> 01:19:41.240
The only time you catch a one

01:19:41.323 --> 01:19:44.868
is they're going to
a doctor's appointment or something.

01:19:44.952 --> 01:19:46.662
And it really is upsetting.

01:19:46.745 --> 01:19:50.082
You walk by, they're normally
being lifted out of a minivan

01:19:50.165 --> 01:19:53.002
with a special crane onto a special chair.

01:19:53.085 --> 01:19:58.090
And when you see a one,
it does ruin your day, doesn't it?

01:19:59.133 --> 01:20:02.678
You walk by the one
and you're like, "Oh, fuck me.

01:20:05.431 --> 01:20:08.684
Oh, that's a fucking one
if ever I've seen one."

01:20:10.060 --> 01:20:12.688
You get to work and you can't focus,

01:20:12.771 --> 01:20:14.023
and your boss is like, "What's wrong?"

01:20:14.106 --> 01:20:17.568
And you're like,
"I saw a fucking one, didn't I?"

01:20:17.651 --> 01:20:19.903
And they're like,
"Oh, it couldn't have been that..."

01:20:19.987 --> 01:20:22.573
"It was that bad!

01:20:22.656 --> 01:20:24.241
You weren't there!

01:20:24.325 --> 01:20:27.119
This is bullshit!
I was gonna eat today."

01:20:30.414 --> 01:20:32.624
Now, in case anyone's wondering...

01:20:33.709 --> 01:20:35.669
and I know you're not...

01:20:36.795 --> 01:20:38.547
I'm a five.

01:20:39.465 --> 01:20:41.717
The reason I know I'm a five
is 'cause, as I said,

01:20:41.800 --> 01:20:44.887
95% of the population is four, five, six,

01:20:44.970 --> 01:20:46.555
an average-looking human being.

01:20:46.638 --> 01:20:48.599
Now, the reason I know I'm a five is this.

01:20:48.682 --> 01:20:52.269
When I walk past people, nothing happens.

01:20:52.353 --> 01:20:54.063
[audience laughing]

01:20:56.774 --> 01:20:59.651
People don't get upset,
nor do they get disappointed.

01:20:59.735 --> 01:21:02.363
We all move on with our lives.

01:21:02.446 --> 01:21:04.365
I have hair.

01:21:04.448 --> 01:21:06.825
But it's shit hair.

01:21:06.909 --> 01:21:08.911
Five!

01:21:08.994 --> 01:21:10.329
I have teeth.

01:21:10.412 --> 01:21:13.332
They're a little yellow.
They're a little crooked.

01:21:13.415 --> 01:21:15.250
But they're all there!

01:21:16.251 --> 01:21:18.212
- Five!
- [audience laughing]

01:21:19.963 --> 01:21:22.841
I have eyes.
They do not sparkle.

01:21:22.925 --> 01:21:27.429
- But they do face in the same direction.
- [audience laughing]

01:21:29.807 --> 01:21:31.975
Five!

01:21:32.559 --> 01:21:36.355
And because I'm a five,
that means society has deemed it okay

01:21:36.438 --> 01:21:39.483
for me and other fives
to get into dimly-lit rooms...

01:21:39.566 --> 01:21:41.693
and we can fuck each other.

01:21:41.777 --> 01:21:43.320
And no one gets upset.
They're like,

01:21:43.404 --> 01:21:47.449
"Oh, it's a couple of fives fucking.
Let them have their fun."

01:21:47.533 --> 01:21:50.911
And we get in there
with our average five bodies, like just...

01:21:50.994 --> 01:21:54.915
My little gut resting
on her fucking imperfect floppy ass,

01:21:54.998 --> 01:21:57.000
and we're just fucking.

01:21:57.084 --> 01:22:01.130
We're sweating on each other
'cause neither of us work out.

01:22:01.839 --> 01:22:04.633
Just grabbing onto an average tit, like...
[groaning]

01:22:06.718 --> 01:22:08.679
And the two of us are thinking about,

01:22:08.762 --> 01:22:11.932
a seven that we know
that we actually want to fuck.

01:22:12.891 --> 01:22:15.644
I'm like, "Maybe if she
gets depressed or something,

01:22:15.727 --> 01:22:17.354
I could swoop in there. That would be..."

01:22:18.313 --> 01:22:22.568
'Cause us fives, we do not
think about the nines and the tens

01:22:22.651 --> 01:22:25.529
- because we dare not touch the sun.
- [audience laughing]

01:22:28.949 --> 01:22:30.117
Now...

01:22:31.243 --> 01:22:34.037
I'm a minor celebrity,

01:22:34.121 --> 01:22:37.332
so that means I get to fuck sixes.

01:22:41.879 --> 01:22:43.672
I fuck the shit out of sixes.

01:22:43.755 --> 01:22:46.425
People go, "He's off the telly.
He can fuck a six."

01:22:49.511 --> 01:22:52.306
Fucked some sevens?
Yeah, I fucked some sevens.

01:22:52.389 --> 01:22:54.183
Couple of eights.

01:22:54.266 --> 01:22:55.726
One nine!

01:22:56.643 --> 01:22:59.730
Best day ever. I fucked a nine.

01:22:59.813 --> 01:23:00.814
Now...

01:23:05.569 --> 01:23:07.488
I'm also a drinker.

01:23:07.571 --> 01:23:09.281
So...

01:23:09.364 --> 01:23:11.867
I have fucked some fours...

01:23:11.950 --> 01:23:13.535
[audience laughing]

01:23:15.621 --> 01:23:17.539
a shitload of threes...

01:23:20.375 --> 01:23:21.793
and one two.

01:23:24.630 --> 01:23:27.758
And when I fucked the two,
that was the lowest point in my life.

01:23:27.841 --> 01:23:32.846
[chuckling] I gave up drinking
for 18 months after I fucked the two.

01:23:32.930 --> 01:23:34.890
That's how important it is
to be good-looking.

01:23:34.973 --> 01:23:37.559
I fucked a two
and my whole self-esteem was ruined...

01:23:38.769 --> 01:23:41.063
Oh, wait, I remember
when I fucked the two,

01:23:41.146 --> 01:23:42.731
I woke up in the... Hey, hang on.

01:23:42.814 --> 01:23:45.859
I'm still writing the letter
to my son, by the way.

01:23:45.943 --> 01:23:47.319
[audience laughing]

01:23:54.701 --> 01:23:58.455
So, I remember when I fucked the two,
Hank. And I woke up...

01:24:00.040 --> 01:24:01.083
next to her.

01:24:01.166 --> 01:24:04.336
And I rolled over...
I was hungover, like, "Oh, what happened?"

01:24:04.419 --> 01:24:07.339
And then I saw her and went,
"Oh, no! Fuck this!" And then...

01:24:08.757 --> 01:24:11.468
And I went into the fetal position.
I started... [groaning]

01:24:11.552 --> 01:24:14.721
"It's a fucking two.
That's a two. That's a two."

01:24:15.973 --> 01:24:19.059
Everybody in this world
likes to think they're a good person.

01:24:19.142 --> 01:24:22.563
Not all of us are good people.
We all think we're a good person.

01:24:22.688 --> 01:24:24.147
And so my brain did this.

01:24:24.231 --> 01:24:26.900
"Come on, Jim. You're better than this.

01:24:28.485 --> 01:24:30.445
Maybe if you talk to it.

01:24:30.529 --> 01:24:32.197
[audience laughing]

01:24:33.949 --> 01:24:37.411
Maybe you'll find out
the thing has dreams or feelings.

01:24:39.538 --> 01:24:41.832
Give that a go."

01:24:41.915 --> 01:24:45.127
So I rolled over
with the best of intentions, like,

01:24:45.210 --> 01:24:48.046
"Hey, do you...
Oh, no! Fuck off! No way, man."

01:24:51.592 --> 01:24:54.970
And she tried to comfort me
with her claw, just...

01:24:55.053 --> 01:24:56.763
[audience laughing]

01:25:04.855 --> 01:25:06.690
I'll never forget the two.

01:25:07.858 --> 01:25:11.653
But it's been so long now
that I can laugh about it.

01:25:11.737 --> 01:25:14.072
I do laugh about it. I was in my car,

01:25:14.156 --> 01:25:17.743
remembering how the two was
the worst thing that happened to me.

01:25:17.826 --> 01:25:20.370
And I was like this... [laughs]

01:25:20.454 --> 01:25:22.623
"Oh, you fucked a two.

01:25:24.791 --> 01:25:26.376
Classic Jim Jefferies.

01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:30.964
When will you ever learn?"

01:25:32.341 --> 01:25:34.593
And I was sitting in the car...

01:25:34.676 --> 01:25:37.721
and I was thinking
about how fucking the two...

01:25:39.264 --> 01:25:42.392
was the worst thing
I've ever done in my life.

01:25:42.976 --> 01:25:45.812
And then my brain did a horrible thing.

01:25:45.896 --> 01:25:48.148
My brain went...

01:25:49.358 --> 01:25:52.235
"That's how the nine felt
when she woke up next to you."

01:25:52.319 --> 01:25:53.820
[audience laughing]

01:25:54.738 --> 01:25:56.823
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much.

01:25:56.907 --> 01:25:58.742
- [audience cheering]
- Appreciate it.

01:25:58.825 --> 01:26:00.577
[chuckling] We'll see you later.

01:26:01.745 --> 01:26:04.539
[rock music playing]
