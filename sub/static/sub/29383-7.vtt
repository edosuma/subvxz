WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:04.004
-(laughter, chatter)

00:08.176 --> 00:10.010
-* East is east *
-Three licorice.

00:10.044 --> 00:13.647
* And west is west, and
the wrong one I have chose *

00:13.681 --> 00:16.384
That'll be a nickel.

00:16.417 --> 00:18.186
It's a penny a whip
at the market, Lavinia.

00:18.219 --> 00:19.720
Well, you're not at the market.
You're at camp.

00:19.753 --> 00:21.021
And here it's three
for a nickel.

00:21.055 --> 00:22.823
* Buttons and bows *

00:22.856 --> 00:25.326
* Do, do, do, do *

00:25.359 --> 00:27.128
* Do-do, do, do, do... *

00:30.364 --> 00:33.934
Hey, why aren't you two out
playing with the other kids?

00:33.967 --> 00:36.137
-They hate me.
-They do.

00:38.239 --> 00:39.607
Hey, Mom?

00:39.640 --> 00:42.042
-Hay is for horses.
-Sorry.

00:42.076 --> 00:44.812
Mom, is the refrigerator
running?

00:46.080 --> 00:47.448
Yes.

00:47.481 --> 00:49.049
(laughs):
Then you better go catch it.

00:51.419 --> 00:53.387
You crack me up.

00:53.421 --> 00:54.955
That's not funny.
It's stupid.

00:54.988 --> 00:56.957
Refrigerators don't have legs.

00:56.990 --> 00:58.459
What are you reading?

00:58.492 --> 00:59.927
-Hmm?
-Show it to me.

01:02.430 --> 01:04.332
True Vice.

01:05.399 --> 01:08.236
This gobbledygook
is poisoning your mind.

01:10.003 --> 01:12.240
Maybe if you didn't have your
head in comic books all day,

01:12.273 --> 01:13.274
you'd have more friends.

01:14.508 --> 01:16.710
Do you want to be liked?

01:16.744 --> 01:18.246
Do you?

01:19.247 --> 01:21.415
Stop being so sullen.

01:21.449 --> 01:24.552
Smile when you look at people.

01:24.585 --> 01:27.455
Don't be a bump on a log.

01:28.989 --> 01:31.659
Why can't you be more clever?

01:31.692 --> 01:32.926
Like Bobby?

01:34.428 --> 01:36.897
Do you think I want to be
the camp cook?

01:36.930 --> 01:39.833
I slave all day
putting food on the table

01:39.867 --> 01:42.436
for a hundred kids-- I do it
so that you can have a summer.

01:42.470 --> 01:45.539
I sweat blood for you.
I will not tolerate sarcasm!

01:46.507 --> 01:48.509
Can we go swimming?

01:52.180 --> 01:53.814
Yeah. Yes.

01:55.015 --> 01:56.750
Take that with you.

01:56.784 --> 01:58.152
Go on.

01:58.186 --> 01:59.820
I'll keep this.

02:01.655 --> 02:03.023
Psst.

02:04.492 --> 02:07.628
Don't let Bobby
out of your sight.

02:10.364 --> 02:13.100
(excited chatter,
shrieking)

02:13.133 --> 02:14.668
(whistle blows)

02:21.008 --> 02:22.776
(giggling)

02:22.810 --> 02:25.179
How's the water?

02:27.047 --> 02:30.117
Cold, but you got enough blubber
to keep you warm.

02:30.150 --> 02:32.152
-(laughing)
-Come on.

02:34.755 --> 02:36.457
Come on. Let's go swimming.

02:36.490 --> 02:38.226
I'm not swimming,
and neither are you.

02:38.259 --> 02:40.060
What are we supposed to do?

02:40.093 --> 02:42.630
Just... nothing.

02:42.663 --> 02:44.832
Well, that's swell.

02:49.370 --> 02:51.572
Just...

02:51.605 --> 02:53.674
go sit down there.
Don't move.

03:35.148 --> 03:36.784
(lifeguard sighs)

03:41.622 --> 03:44.024
(water splashing)

03:44.057 --> 03:46.126
Bobby?

03:46.159 --> 03:47.928
Bobby?!

03:53.066 --> 03:56.103
(sighs)
Stupid kid.

03:56.136 --> 03:58.105
(engine starting)

04:00.974 --> 04:02.242
Hey! Stop!

04:02.276 --> 04:04.144
-(thudding)
-Stop the engine!

04:10.150 --> 04:12.620
LAVINIA:
Bobby?

04:12.653 --> 04:15.255
Bobby? Bobby?!
I want to see him.

04:15.289 --> 04:16.890
-No, I want to see him.
-You don't... you don't want

04:16.924 --> 04:18.926
-to see him. It was an accident.
-I want to see... my son.

04:18.959 --> 04:21.261
What happened?
What did you do?!

04:21.295 --> 04:23.464
What the hell happened,
Benjamin?!

04:23.497 --> 04:25.633
What the hell
happened, Benjamin?!

04:25.666 --> 04:28.235
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
-Get off me! Get off!

04:28.268 --> 04:30.771
-I'm sorry. (cries)
-So where...
where's the lifeguard?

04:30.804 --> 04:32.473
Where is that little shit?!

04:32.506 --> 04:35.275
Where were you?!
Where were you?!

04:35.309 --> 04:37.378
Where were you?!

04:38.812 --> 04:40.548
You killed him!
You killed him!

04:41.615 --> 04:43.617
You killed my baby.

04:43.651 --> 04:46.620
You're all guilty.

04:46.654 --> 04:48.756
Every one of you.

04:48.789 --> 04:53.126
Every one of you!
Every one of you!

04:53.160 --> 04:56.196
(sobbing)

04:56.229 --> 05:00.868
You killed my beautiful boy.

05:00.901 --> 05:03.303
(crying):
Baby? Bobby?

05:03.337 --> 05:05.806
Bobby?

05:05.839 --> 05:07.307
Baby?

05:07.341 --> 05:09.810
No!

05:09.843 --> 05:11.845
(screaming):
No!

06:19.079 --> 06:20.848
(music slows, distorts)

06:20.881 --> 06:22.315
(film projector clicking,
then shuts off)

06:28.255 --> 06:31.459
-(door squeaks open)
-(groans)

06:31.492 --> 06:32.960
Oh. Oh.

06:32.993 --> 06:34.795
(groans)

06:37.397 --> 06:39.567
-(coughing)
-(sighs)

06:39.600 --> 06:42.402
-(coughing)
-Try to breathe.

06:42.436 --> 06:45.405
-(coughing)
-You're gonna feel like

06:45.439 --> 06:48.308
you want to die,
but you're not dead.

06:48.341 --> 06:52.312
The drug I swapped for the final
injection is called baclofen.

06:52.345 --> 06:56.550
Ran across it doing pharmacology
research at my old job.

06:56.584 --> 06:59.887
It's prescribed
for muscle spasms and M.S.,

06:59.920 --> 07:02.456
and does a bang-up job
for mimicking brain damage

07:02.490 --> 07:04.124
if you O.D. just right.

07:04.157 --> 07:07.094
But it's gonna take a few days
to get out your system.

07:07.127 --> 07:08.996
Get away from me, you bitch!

07:09.029 --> 07:11.632
Listen, you're gonna
hurt yourself.

07:11.665 --> 07:13.801
You need to trust me.

07:13.834 --> 07:15.302
Never.

07:15.335 --> 07:17.437
(Brooke sniffles)

07:17.471 --> 07:19.139
(screaming)

07:19.172 --> 07:21.174
(coughing)

07:21.208 --> 07:23.210
(yells)

07:35.656 --> 07:37.591
(shrieking, screaming)

07:37.625 --> 07:40.160
(panting)

07:49.970 --> 07:51.805
I don't know how so many bodies
get in here.

07:51.839 --> 07:53.807
-(gasps)
-(roaring)
-(screaming)

07:53.841 --> 07:56.109
(laughing)

07:56.143 --> 07:58.445
All right, Vinnie!

07:58.478 --> 08:00.080
(keys jingle, door opens)

08:01.515 --> 08:03.016
(TV plays quietly)

08:04.017 --> 08:06.019
It's okay. Just me.

08:07.354 --> 08:09.289
Got you some food.

08:09.322 --> 08:12.159
-I don't think I can eat.
-Well, you got to try.

08:12.192 --> 08:13.827
You got to get your strength up.

08:13.861 --> 08:16.063
That guy I told you about--

08:16.096 --> 08:17.798
he's gonna have
your new passport soon.

08:17.831 --> 08:20.834
You'll have a new name,
a new life.

08:20.868 --> 08:22.235
You'll be finally free.

08:22.269 --> 08:23.671
The world thinks you're dead.

08:23.704 --> 08:25.038
Let me check your pulse.

08:25.072 --> 08:26.707
(gasps, groans)

08:27.841 --> 08:29.476
Why are you doing this?

08:29.509 --> 08:30.911
The last time I saw you,

08:30.944 --> 08:33.213
you had me strung up
as serial killer bait.

08:33.246 --> 08:36.216
-(gasps)
-Is this another one
of your sick experiments?

08:36.249 --> 08:39.887
This is... just me trying
to make it right.

08:39.920 --> 08:42.022
-Why?
-(sighs)

08:42.055 --> 08:44.357
Let's just say that...

08:44.391 --> 08:46.860
I know there are things
waiting for us when we die.

08:46.894 --> 08:48.996
And I'm just trying
to make sure

08:49.029 --> 08:50.831
that I go
where the good things are,

08:50.864 --> 08:52.866
not the other place.

08:54.101 --> 08:56.269
You should have just
let me die.

08:56.303 --> 08:58.639
(Rita sighs)

09:03.143 --> 09:06.279
Brooke, forget you saw that.

09:06.313 --> 09:08.281
Margaret's putting on
a concert?

09:08.315 --> 09:10.884
You knew about this?

09:10.918 --> 09:14.254
Forget about it, Brooke.
Forget about her.

09:16.657 --> 09:19.092
I was wrong.

09:20.661 --> 09:23.063
I do have a reason to live.

09:23.096 --> 09:24.665
And it's to see her die.

09:26.333 --> 09:27.467
I'm going back there.

09:27.500 --> 09:30.203
Brooke, it's not worth it.

09:30.237 --> 09:31.271
You're gonna have
a new life.

09:31.304 --> 09:33.473
She stole my life!

09:35.075 --> 09:39.379
1,825 days.

09:39.412 --> 09:42.916
That's how long I spent
locked up in that hellhole.

09:42.950 --> 09:45.452
I counted every single one.

09:45.485 --> 09:48.588
I counted days, I counted
cracks in the ceiling.

09:48.622 --> 09:52.292
I counted how many times
I blinked in a fucking hour,

09:52.325 --> 09:54.294
just to take my mind off
everything I was missing

09:54.327 --> 09:56.797
on the outside.

09:56.830 --> 09:58.465
But you know what?

09:58.498 --> 10:01.134
You can't not think about it.

10:01.168 --> 10:04.972
Of the decade you never
got a chance to live.

10:05.005 --> 10:09.476
The '80s was morning
in America,

10:09.509 --> 10:12.612
and I spent my morning in lockup

10:12.646 --> 10:15.448
because of this lying bitch
Margaret.

10:17.651 --> 10:19.653
Brooke...

10:22.723 --> 10:24.792
I can't turn back
the hands of time.

10:24.825 --> 10:26.393
I wish I could.

10:28.495 --> 10:33.300
But there is one place
the '80s will never be over...

10:33.333 --> 10:35.803
-and if you hydrate properly,
-(scoffs)

10:35.836 --> 10:39.139
and put some food in your system
like a good little badass,

10:39.172 --> 10:40.808
I'll take you there.

10:40.841 --> 10:42.142
("Armageddon It"
by Def Leppard playing)

10:44.978 --> 10:46.613
(indistinct chatter)

10:46.646 --> 10:48.716
I didn't think
they still had these places.

10:48.749 --> 10:50.383
They don't, really.

10:50.417 --> 10:52.285
Not anymore.

10:52.319 --> 10:54.788
Only a few left in the state
like this one.

10:54.822 --> 10:57.457
Dying breed.

10:57.490 --> 10:59.727
* You know
you can't stop it *

10:59.760 --> 11:00.961
Come on.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.329
* You know you got it *

11:02.362 --> 11:05.899
* Hey, but are you getting it? *

11:07.034 --> 11:10.503
* Ooh, really getting it? *

11:10.537 --> 11:12.472
* Come get it from me *

11:12.505 --> 11:14.474
* Give me all of your loving *

11:14.507 --> 11:16.043
* Every little bit *

11:16.076 --> 11:18.846
* Give me all that you got *

11:18.879 --> 11:20.647
* Every bit of it *

11:20.680 --> 11:21.982
* Every bit of your loving *

11:22.015 --> 11:24.351
* Oh, come on, live a bit *

11:24.384 --> 11:26.319
* Never want to stop *

11:26.353 --> 11:28.655
* Yeah, but are you
getting it? *

11:28.688 --> 11:30.824
* Armageddon it *

11:30.858 --> 11:32.492
* Ooh, really getting it? *

11:32.525 --> 11:34.027
* Yes, Armageddon it *

11:37.130 --> 11:38.665
* Yeah *

11:41.034 --> 11:43.036
* Are you getting it? *

11:43.070 --> 11:45.605
-You looked pretty good
out there.
-Yeah?

11:45.638 --> 11:47.107
My back skate could use
a little work,

11:47.140 --> 11:50.543
but, uh... thanks.

11:50.577 --> 11:51.945
I needed this.

11:51.979 --> 11:53.881
It's not too late.

11:53.914 --> 11:55.615
You don't have to go back
to Redwood.

11:55.648 --> 11:59.286
One day in the sun doesn't erase
five years of darkness.

11:59.319 --> 12:00.754
I'm going back.

12:00.788 --> 12:02.422
I have to.

12:02.455 --> 12:04.191
ALEX:
Oh, hi.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.193
Excuse me. Um...

12:06.226 --> 12:07.394
I overheard you guys saying
you're going

12:07.427 --> 12:08.628
to the festival at Redwood?

12:08.661 --> 12:09.696
My car broke down trying to get

12:09.729 --> 12:10.730
to my girlfriend's house.

12:10.764 --> 12:12.299
It's on the way;
I'll pay for gas.

12:12.332 --> 12:14.768
Sorry. I got a policy
about strangers.

12:14.802 --> 12:16.469
Mm.

12:16.503 --> 12:18.806
Everybody's a stranger...
'til they're not.

12:18.839 --> 12:20.673
-I'm Bruce.
-We've got to go.

12:21.942 --> 12:23.376
Come on.

12:23.410 --> 12:24.411
-Better luck.
-Yeah.

12:24.444 --> 12:25.478
No problem at all.

12:25.512 --> 12:27.247
You guys have a nice day.

12:30.183 --> 12:32.252
(starter grinding)

12:33.854 --> 12:35.823
(starter grinding)

12:35.856 --> 12:37.324
RITA:
Do we even know

12:37.357 --> 12:39.459
-what we're looking for?
-I know the battery

12:39.492 --> 12:40.760
and the dipstick.

12:40.794 --> 12:43.831
Do you want me to take a look?

12:46.199 --> 12:48.435
I've fixed a few clunkers
in my day.

12:51.171 --> 12:54.774
Well, let's see
what's going on.

12:54.808 --> 12:57.644
Oh, I think I might see
the problem.

12:57.677 --> 13:00.280
Loose distributor cap.

13:00.313 --> 13:03.650
Will one of you
try starting it up?

13:06.486 --> 13:08.288
(starter grinding)

13:08.321 --> 13:09.789
How about now?

13:09.823 --> 13:12.125
-(engine starts)
-Oh.

13:12.159 --> 13:14.161
Good to go.

13:15.495 --> 13:16.796
Thanks.

13:17.797 --> 13:19.199
Glad to help.

13:21.701 --> 13:24.471
I, uh, I believe in karma.

13:24.504 --> 13:26.506
What goes around comes around.

13:32.846 --> 13:34.347
Hey.

13:35.849 --> 13:37.184
Get in.

13:37.217 --> 13:39.953
What about your stranger policy?

13:39.987 --> 13:42.655
Once a guy's gone under my hood,

13:42.689 --> 13:45.492
he's not a stranger anymore.

14:10.017 --> 14:12.119
(radio playing indistinctly)

14:14.221 --> 14:16.189
-How far do you have to go?
-Huh?

14:16.223 --> 14:18.025
To your girlfriend?

14:18.058 --> 14:19.893
Just up a ways.

14:19.927 --> 14:23.163
I-I'll know the exit
when I see it.

14:23.196 --> 14:24.164
Is she expecting you?

14:24.197 --> 14:25.832
Sure is.

14:25.865 --> 14:29.069
Then why didn't you call her
and have her pick you up

14:29.102 --> 14:31.238
from the roller rink?

14:31.271 --> 14:32.839
She doesn't like to drive.

14:32.872 --> 14:35.375
The roads scare the hell
out of her.

14:35.408 --> 14:37.710
I heard about this on the news.

14:37.744 --> 14:40.280
It's happening all over.

14:40.313 --> 14:42.916
So, you're driving at night,

14:42.950 --> 14:45.552
and you see a car
coming towards you

14:45.585 --> 14:46.886
with his headlights off.

14:46.920 --> 14:48.922
As a courtesy,
you flash your lights

14:48.956 --> 14:51.391
to let him know
to turn on his headlights.

14:51.424 --> 14:53.927
That car then makes a U-turn.

14:53.961 --> 14:58.798
They follow you home...
and kill you.

15:00.433 --> 15:02.469
There's true evil out there.

15:02.502 --> 15:04.537
No, I think you're just
trying to scare us.

15:04.571 --> 15:06.773
I've dealt with people like you
every day

15:06.806 --> 15:08.541
for the last five years.

15:08.575 --> 15:10.910
They use fear to try
to control others.

15:10.944 --> 15:12.445
It's not gonna work with us.

15:12.479 --> 15:15.048
We made a mistake.
Your ride's over.

15:15.082 --> 15:18.451
Whoa, whoa, I was just
making conversation.

15:18.485 --> 15:21.888
I'm sorry if I said something
that got under your skin.

15:21.921 --> 15:23.123
Donna, pull over.

15:25.492 --> 15:27.294
Just-just trying to be nice.

15:27.327 --> 15:28.996
(quietly):
Shut up.

15:37.437 --> 15:39.639
Sorry, dude, you gotta get out.

15:39.672 --> 15:43.143
Do I...

15:43.176 --> 15:44.844
Donna?

15:55.788 --> 15:58.758
It's an oven outside.

15:58.791 --> 16:02.029
I could get heatstroke.

16:02.062 --> 16:04.998
You wouldn't want that
on your conscience,

16:05.032 --> 16:07.867
would you, Donna?

16:07.900 --> 16:09.869
We're not gonna ask you again.

16:09.902 --> 16:12.472
-(siren wailing)
-Shit.

16:12.505 --> 16:14.507
Shit.

16:27.554 --> 16:30.323
(clears throat)

16:32.692 --> 16:34.994
Everything okay?

16:35.028 --> 16:36.863
There's no services
out here for miles.

16:36.896 --> 16:39.199
Everything's fine, Officer.

16:39.232 --> 16:42.001
You guys together?

16:44.837 --> 16:47.974
Actually, we just met him.

16:48.007 --> 16:50.977
Talked us into
giving him a ride.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.679
Haven't you seen the posters
of the girls

16:52.712 --> 16:54.981
that have gone missing
along this highway?

16:55.014 --> 16:57.317
I'm gonna need to see some ID
from everyone.

16:57.350 --> 16:59.186
-(gunshot)
-Shit!

16:59.219 --> 17:00.253
Go, go, go, go!

17:00.287 --> 17:03.390
Fuck you!

17:11.364 --> 17:12.865
(officer groaning)

17:19.939 --> 17:22.709
(gunshot)

17:35.455 --> 17:37.957
-(zipper unzips)
-(exhales)

17:37.990 --> 17:40.427
Oh, come on.

17:43.096 --> 17:46.433
Oh, come on.

17:46.466 --> 17:48.468
(exhales)

17:55.074 --> 17:57.210
Oh...

17:57.244 --> 17:58.778
What the hell, dude?!

17:58.811 --> 18:01.614
What's your major malfunction?

18:01.648 --> 18:03.450
I've met you before.

18:04.817 --> 18:06.819
Why are you still
dressed like that?

18:06.853 --> 18:08.988
I'm dead, man.

18:09.021 --> 18:10.990
And in these woods,
I'm not the only one.

18:11.023 --> 18:13.126
(cries out)

18:13.160 --> 18:15.094
Guys, he just wandered over
here. I think he's harmless.

18:15.128 --> 18:18.298
-It's Mr. Jingles, dipshit!
-This prick slaughtered us!

18:18.331 --> 18:20.800
I totally recognized him.

18:20.833 --> 18:24.971
Wait! Montana said no killing...

18:25.004 --> 18:27.507
till the festival.

18:29.676 --> 18:32.479
Shit!

18:33.980 --> 18:37.016
Fine. I guess we're
taking him to go, then.

18:42.489 --> 18:43.956
(grunts)

18:43.990 --> 18:46.293
(groaning)

18:49.128 --> 18:50.463
You left this place.

18:50.497 --> 18:52.799
And to willingly come back?

18:52.832 --> 18:55.134
Well, that makes you even
more deranged than we thought.

18:55.168 --> 18:58.171
He gave me no choice.
You need to let me go.

18:58.205 --> 19:00.039
I came back here
to kill Richard Ramirez.

19:01.474 --> 19:03.042
But he's already dead.

19:03.075 --> 19:04.477
I saw you murder him.

19:04.511 --> 19:06.346
Ramirez has the devil
on his side,

19:06.379 --> 19:08.047
and he's on his way
back here now.

19:08.080 --> 19:10.116
Who gives a shit?

19:10.149 --> 19:11.484
This motherfucker
cut off my head.

19:11.518 --> 19:12.852
-He needs to answer for that...
-Ray!

19:12.885 --> 19:15.722
Don't make me gut you again.

19:17.023 --> 19:20.193
I don't understand.
You're-you're all ghosts?

19:20.227 --> 19:22.128
Are you brain dead?

19:22.161 --> 19:24.631
You killed half
of us here, remember?

19:24.664 --> 19:26.233
You and Margaret
are both psychos,

19:26.266 --> 19:28.735
and we got caught
in your crossfire.

19:28.768 --> 19:30.237
None of this makes any sense.

19:30.270 --> 19:33.540
We spent the first few months
after we died

19:33.573 --> 19:36.976
sort of just wandering around,
feeling confused and angry.

19:37.009 --> 19:39.646
Time doesn't really exist
for us here,

19:39.679 --> 19:42.148
so years went by like minutes.

19:42.181 --> 19:46.018
What does being a ghost
feel like?

19:46.052 --> 19:47.687
It's actually not that bad.

19:47.720 --> 19:49.522
There's a constant feeling
of emptiness and longing,

19:49.556 --> 19:52.992
but that's pretty much how
I felt when I was alive, so...

19:53.025 --> 19:55.027
-Do you feel pain?
-RAY: Yes.

19:55.061 --> 19:58.565
-And fear.
-But we can feel pleasure, too.

19:58.598 --> 20:01.668
As you know, killing people is
totally tubular.

20:01.701 --> 20:03.270
Especially when there are
no consequences.

20:03.303 --> 20:05.338
Which is why we're gonna kill
every motherfucker

20:05.372 --> 20:07.340
who steps foot in here
for Margaret's festival.

20:07.374 --> 20:08.875
That's insane.

20:08.908 --> 20:10.777
Why would you do that?

20:10.810 --> 20:13.179
So we can get the hell
out of here.

20:13.212 --> 20:16.683
I mean, two dead bodies recently
got this place some press.

20:16.716 --> 20:20.720
An entire music festival
viciously slaughtered?

20:20.753 --> 20:22.889
Well, that'll draw every
paranormal P.I.

20:22.922 --> 20:24.591
and Ghostbuster wannabe
from across the globe.

20:24.624 --> 20:26.793
And one of them's bound
to figure out how to beat

20:26.826 --> 20:30.229
what's got us kept here;
this fucking curse.

20:30.263 --> 20:31.764
Don't you understand?

20:31.798 --> 20:34.133
You're away from the horrors
of the world.

20:34.166 --> 20:36.603
(chuckles)
Not really.

20:36.636 --> 20:38.137
You think we're alone
in these woods?

20:38.170 --> 20:39.439
We're not alone.

20:41.974 --> 20:43.042
(crying out)

20:43.075 --> 20:45.645
There's someone else.

20:45.678 --> 20:47.780
A woman.
She wears a white nightgown,

20:47.814 --> 20:50.149
and she's constantly
terrorizing us.

20:50.182 --> 20:52.919
No one knows who she is or why
she hates us so much.

20:52.952 --> 20:55.722
I do.

20:55.755 --> 20:59.091
-She's my mother.
-(scoffs)

20:59.125 --> 21:02.762
1970 wasn't the first massacre.

21:02.795 --> 21:05.898
There was another one
20 years before.

21:05.932 --> 21:09.969
If anything, that's when
this blood curse began.

21:10.002 --> 21:12.972
When it first opened, this place
went by a different name.

21:13.005 --> 21:15.942
Camp Golden Star.

21:15.975 --> 21:18.645
A little flower blooming
in the wake of a war

21:18.678 --> 21:21.280
that took
400,000 American souls,

21:21.314 --> 21:23.850
including my old man.

21:23.883 --> 21:26.453
Luckily,
the new camp was hiring.

21:26.486 --> 21:29.422
The work was hard
and the pay was shit, but...

21:29.456 --> 21:31.958
free childcare was a benefit

21:31.991 --> 21:34.461
a widowed mother
couldn't turn down.

21:34.494 --> 21:37.530
She hated it.

21:37.564 --> 21:39.966
She was always so angry.

21:39.999 --> 21:41.868
When I looked in her eyes,

21:41.901 --> 21:44.136
I didn't see love.

21:44.170 --> 21:46.072
Only hate.

21:47.807 --> 21:49.376
And then...

21:49.409 --> 21:51.644
Bobby died.

21:51.678 --> 21:53.713
I wanted to go home,
but my mother,

21:53.746 --> 21:55.314
she wouldn't leave.

21:55.348 --> 21:58.150
(screaming in distance)

21:58.184 --> 22:00.387
I couldn't understand why.

22:00.420 --> 22:02.689
Until that night.

22:08.361 --> 22:10.563
Mom?

22:11.664 --> 22:14.200
-Mom?
-(scrapes, thuds)

22:24.343 --> 22:26.713
(creaking)

22:31.350 --> 22:33.820
(groaning)

22:33.853 --> 22:37.557
(gurgling)

22:43.029 --> 22:43.996
(crying)

22:44.030 --> 22:47.266
It had to be done, Benji.

22:47.299 --> 22:50.269
They needed to pay
for what happened to Bobby.

22:50.302 --> 22:52.839
(breathing heavily)

22:52.872 --> 22:54.674
It's okay, honey.

22:54.707 --> 22:56.676
(crying)

22:56.709 --> 22:59.145
Come to Mommy.

23:02.549 --> 23:05.452
You never listen, do you?

23:06.919 --> 23:08.955
He was your baby brother.

23:08.988 --> 23:10.623
You were supposed
to take care of him.

23:10.657 --> 23:12.358
-No.
-(grunts)

23:12.391 --> 23:13.860
(screams)

23:13.893 --> 23:14.761
(grunts)

23:14.794 --> 23:16.128
Oh, I'm gonna get you.

23:16.162 --> 23:18.565
(creaking)

23:19.599 --> 23:21.133
Benji!

23:21.167 --> 23:22.902
Come here!

23:22.935 --> 23:24.070
(grunting)

23:24.103 --> 23:25.404
Benji!

23:31.478 --> 23:32.479
(gasps)

23:34.080 --> 23:36.916
(gasping)

23:41.788 --> 23:45.157
(crying)

23:47.860 --> 23:49.929
I'm sorry.

23:49.962 --> 23:51.931
(crying)

23:59.205 --> 24:00.640
Camp Golden Star was shut down.

24:00.673 --> 24:03.643
But ten years later,
Camp Redwood opened.

24:03.676 --> 24:04.811
They may have changed the name,

24:04.844 --> 24:07.279
but they couldn't erase
the evil.

24:07.313 --> 24:10.116
Her blood had poured
into this ground,

24:10.149 --> 24:12.652
with her pain and her rage.

24:12.685 --> 24:15.254
Maybe that's why
you're all still stuck here.

24:15.287 --> 24:17.824
(sighs) It's definitely why
she keeps coming after you.

24:17.857 --> 24:19.859
She hates counselors.

24:21.628 --> 24:24.363
The only person she ever loved
was my brother.

24:26.499 --> 24:28.501
Do you know
where my mother is now?

24:28.535 --> 24:29.669
Xavier will take you.

24:30.703 --> 24:32.138
Why me?

24:32.171 --> 24:33.640
Send Chet.

24:33.673 --> 24:35.007
I'm... (chuckles)

24:35.041 --> 24:36.643
...never going back
to that place.

24:36.676 --> 24:38.177
Fine.

24:38.210 --> 24:40.479
I'll take you.

24:50.356 --> 24:52.324
I'm not going any closer.

24:52.358 --> 24:53.960
I've outrun her once before.

24:53.993 --> 24:56.495
I don't want to find out
what happens if she catches up.

25:12.244 --> 25:14.614
(creaking)

25:56.723 --> 25:58.725
LAVINIA:
Hello, Benji.

26:11.838 --> 26:13.940
Look at you. All grown up.
Tall as your father.

26:13.973 --> 26:15.775
Oh.

26:15.808 --> 26:18.577
It's okay, honey.

26:18.611 --> 26:20.747
Come to Mommy.

26:20.780 --> 26:25.551
You've been here
this whole time?

26:25.584 --> 26:27.954
Poor Benji.

26:27.987 --> 26:30.156
I can see the wheels
turning in your head.

26:31.423 --> 26:33.392
And Bobby's here, too?

26:33.425 --> 26:36.729
Don't say his name!

26:36.763 --> 26:38.164
(crying softly)

26:55.447 --> 26:57.917
I miss your brother so much.

26:57.950 --> 27:01.153
Every day, I-I search for him.

27:01.187 --> 27:04.824
Sometimes, I can hear him,
scared, but I...

27:05.992 --> 27:09.295
...I never find him.

27:09.328 --> 27:14.667
So I'm stuck here, tortured,
in this place,

27:14.701 --> 27:18.805
like the goddess whose child
was swallowed up

27:18.838 --> 27:21.640
into the ground.

27:21.674 --> 27:24.343
I've tried to destroy myself.

27:24.376 --> 27:28.480
Always I'm reborn
to this cursed place.

27:28.514 --> 27:32.685
And then, one day...
I felt something.

27:32.719 --> 27:35.822
A vibration, something primal.

27:35.855 --> 27:38.057
My baby.

27:41.694 --> 27:44.463
But it wasn't him.

27:44.496 --> 27:45.531
(grunts)

27:49.001 --> 27:51.003
It was you.

27:54.173 --> 27:57.376
I saw that look in your eyes.

27:58.745 --> 28:00.980
Like you wanted to stop time.

28:01.013 --> 28:03.415
A mother knows.

28:04.016 --> 28:06.052
You were happy.

28:06.085 --> 28:08.687
Pathetic, really,

28:08.721 --> 28:13.559
the way you mooned
over that girl.

28:14.727 --> 28:17.429
What are you saying?

28:19.465 --> 28:21.233
What did you do?

28:21.267 --> 28:23.235
You should have known.

28:25.437 --> 28:27.774
That girl was already
wrong in the head.

28:29.942 --> 28:33.379
I just needed to give her
a little push.

28:37.716 --> 28:40.887
No. No.

28:40.920 --> 28:43.455
Why are you telling me this?

28:43.489 --> 28:46.893
Why are you appearing to me now
after all this time?

28:46.926 --> 28:48.660
Because I don't like you.

28:50.262 --> 28:53.900
But now, finally, it's time.

28:53.933 --> 28:58.270
I want you to know it was me.

29:00.139 --> 29:03.475
I took the one thing
you cared about...

29:03.509 --> 29:07.914
and I used it to destroy you.

29:07.947 --> 29:09.748
Why do you hate me so much?

29:09.782 --> 29:14.453
Because the wrong son
died that day!

29:14.486 --> 29:17.289
It should have been you!

29:19.491 --> 29:22.294
I know that.

29:22.328 --> 29:25.297
Do you have any idea
the guilt I've felt,

29:25.331 --> 29:28.500
what it's done to me?

29:28.534 --> 29:30.536
Of course I do.

29:32.504 --> 29:34.506
It's turned you into a monster.

29:35.842 --> 29:37.776
You saw that?

29:37.810 --> 29:39.345
I saw everything.

29:39.378 --> 29:41.814
I saw you kill them all.

29:41.848 --> 29:44.716
But one was reborn.

29:48.154 --> 29:50.756
Ramirez.

29:50.789 --> 29:54.927
He killed my wife,
the mother of my child.

29:54.961 --> 29:56.762
Your child?

29:56.795 --> 29:58.597
Yes, a son. I have a son.

29:58.630 --> 30:02.134
He's the only thing
that matters to me now.

30:02.168 --> 30:05.637
As long as Ramirez is out there,
my son will never be safe.

30:05.671 --> 30:07.306
I need to end this.

30:07.339 --> 30:08.975
This will never end.

30:10.209 --> 30:13.179
Because I will spend
every moment

30:13.212 --> 30:17.683
from now to eternity
making sure you burn

30:17.716 --> 30:20.719
in excruciating agony.

30:21.720 --> 30:24.957
Suffering as I do.

30:24.991 --> 30:27.359
It's what you deserve.

30:28.527 --> 30:30.963
I know you, Benji.

30:30.997 --> 30:35.834
I know you...
better than you know yourself.

30:35.868 --> 30:38.804
From the moment you were born,

30:38.837 --> 30:43.809
I knew you were a parasite,

30:43.842 --> 30:45.912
sucking me dry.

30:45.945 --> 30:49.415
A poison that taints and rots

30:49.448 --> 30:52.518
everything you touch.

30:52.551 --> 30:56.155
And so, I pity your son.

30:56.188 --> 30:57.823
I do.

30:57.856 --> 31:03.362
Having you as a father,
he's better off dead.

31:07.033 --> 31:09.668
* Your cruel device *

31:09.701 --> 31:11.670
(crying softly)

31:11.703 --> 31:13.672
* Your blood *

31:13.705 --> 31:15.707
* Like ice *

31:15.741 --> 31:19.445
* One look could kill... *

31:19.478 --> 31:22.714
I never thought I'd say this,
but my mom was right.

31:22.748 --> 31:25.784
Never talk to strangers.

31:25.817 --> 31:28.787
* I want to love you,
but I better not touch *

31:28.820 --> 31:31.057
-* Don't touch *
-* I want to hold you *

31:31.090 --> 31:33.092
* But my senses
tell me to stop *

31:33.125 --> 31:35.594
* I want to kiss you *

31:35.627 --> 31:37.029
* But I want it too much *

31:37.063 --> 31:40.432
Jesus.
What the hell happened here?

31:40.466 --> 31:45.437
* Venomous poison *

31:45.471 --> 31:48.975
* I don't want to break
these chains. *

31:49.008 --> 31:51.810
Karma's a bitch, girls.

32:06.158 --> 32:09.595
Rise and shine, little one.

32:16.969 --> 32:18.971
(gasps)

32:20.939 --> 32:23.909
You were so close.

32:23.942 --> 32:25.077
A few more exits,

32:25.111 --> 32:26.945
and you would have made it
to the festival.

32:26.979 --> 32:27.980
Where's Donna?

32:28.014 --> 32:29.948
What did you do to her?

32:29.982 --> 32:32.684
She's fine.

32:32.718 --> 32:34.720
See for yourself.

32:37.223 --> 32:38.957
No. No.

32:38.991 --> 32:40.559
No.

32:42.561 --> 32:44.196
(panting)

32:44.230 --> 32:46.298
You have two choices before you.

32:46.332 --> 32:49.535
Either you put it in drive,
hit the gas,

32:49.568 --> 32:53.139
and live to see
the great Billy Idol in concert,

32:53.172 --> 32:57.076
or I could shoot you in the face
and drag her myself.

32:58.144 --> 33:00.012
Concrete is so unforgiving.

33:00.046 --> 33:02.514
These old roads
are like cheese graters.

33:02.548 --> 33:05.051
Rip your clothes clean off
at 40 miles an hour.

33:05.084 --> 33:07.053
At 50, human skin sloughs off

33:07.086 --> 33:08.987
like wet paper.

33:09.021 --> 33:10.989
Bones are ground into nubs

33:11.023 --> 33:13.292
as you try to hold your face up.

33:13.325 --> 33:15.794
But one little bump...

33:15.827 --> 33:17.796
and you're bouncing.

33:17.829 --> 33:21.300
That's when pieces of you
start falling off.

33:21.333 --> 33:23.535
How many people have you killed?

33:23.569 --> 33:25.371
Five so far. But I hope

33:25.404 --> 33:27.139
to catch up to Ramirez
by Christmas. He had 13.

33:27.173 --> 33:29.208
One day I hope

33:29.241 --> 33:32.378
to surpass Bundy himself.

33:37.683 --> 33:39.718
So, I die,

33:39.751 --> 33:42.154
or I drag my friend
to her death.

33:42.188 --> 33:43.389
Is that about right?

33:43.422 --> 33:45.857
That's the ticket.

33:51.197 --> 33:52.831
You know what?

33:52.864 --> 33:54.333
Fuck her.

33:54.366 --> 33:57.769
She should never have given you
a ride in the first place.

33:57.803 --> 34:00.206
-(engine starts)
-I'm starting to like you.

34:01.207 --> 34:02.841
(spits)

34:02.874 --> 34:03.875
(engine revs)

34:07.146 --> 34:08.947
What are you waiting for?

34:10.116 --> 34:11.317
Do it!

34:17.889 --> 34:18.990
(Brooke grunts)

34:20.492 --> 34:21.793
(screams)

34:22.828 --> 34:24.830
(grunting)

34:27.333 --> 34:28.567
Donna, wait!

34:28.600 --> 34:31.203
Hell no! I'm choking
this motherfucker out.

34:31.237 --> 34:32.638
You don't want to do that,
trust me.

34:32.671 --> 34:35.040
Can't just let him
get away with it.

34:35.073 --> 34:36.908
Who said anything about that?

34:36.942 --> 34:38.210
MARGARET:
Well,

34:38.244 --> 34:39.411
I didn't think it was possible,

34:39.445 --> 34:41.413
but it looks worse
than I even imagined.

34:41.447 --> 34:43.115
What have you been doing?

34:43.149 --> 34:45.284
You announced the festival
so quickly,

34:45.317 --> 34:47.753
we barely had time
to do anything.

34:47.786 --> 34:50.589
We haven't locked in a caterer,
and do not even get me started

34:50.622 --> 34:52.124
-on hydration.
-Just give 'em

34:52.158 --> 34:53.792
a slice of Wonder Bread
and a Dixie Cup of water.

34:53.825 --> 34:55.294
You can't do that, Margaret.

34:55.327 --> 34:56.828
People are paying
a thousand dollars a head.

34:56.862 --> 34:58.564
That's how I make a profit,
asshole.

34:58.597 --> 34:59.998
And don't you contradict me.

35:00.031 --> 35:02.168
-Remember who you are.
-I'm your husband.

35:02.201 --> 35:04.136
You're a glorified assistant

35:04.170 --> 35:06.138
with no discernable talent
or purpose.

35:06.172 --> 35:09.675
I know. The boys' restroom
is covered in pine needles.

35:09.708 --> 35:12.478
Why don't you take that pendulum
you call a dick

35:12.511 --> 35:13.645
and sweep up the mess?

35:13.679 --> 35:16.148
At least it'll be good
for something, hmm?

35:16.182 --> 35:17.683
(sighs)

35:25.824 --> 35:29.461
COURTNEY:
What fresh hell is this?

35:33.031 --> 35:35.100
So, where do you want
the talent?

35:35.133 --> 35:38.304
-Who are you?
-Oh, that's Kajagoogoo,
you idiot!

35:38.337 --> 35:42.308
Limahl, are you gonna play
"Too Shy"? I love that song.

35:42.341 --> 35:43.809
LIMAHL:
Oh, that's the only song

35:43.842 --> 35:46.111
we're going to play.
It's our biggest hit.

35:46.144 --> 35:48.447
It's the only song
anyone wants to hear.

35:48.480 --> 35:49.815
Wait, just one song?

35:49.848 --> 35:51.183
What about "NeverEnding Story"?

35:51.217 --> 35:53.485
LIMAHL:
Oh, it's from my solo career.

35:53.519 --> 35:56.154
I wouldn't dream of playing it
with the band.

35:56.188 --> 35:57.789
One song-- What are you doing?

35:57.823 --> 36:00.559
-I... (stammers)
I'm gonna go sweep up.
-Okay.

36:00.592 --> 36:02.594
(Margaret and Courtney
speak indistinctly)

36:23.382 --> 36:26.117
MONTANA:
Hmm.

36:27.219 --> 36:29.855
-(chuckling)
-Montana.

36:29.888 --> 36:32.324
I-I thought you were dead.

36:32.358 --> 36:34.893
I am. I'm a...

36:34.926 --> 36:36.828
I don't care what you are.

36:36.862 --> 36:39.498
I'd forgotten what I was missing
until I saw you.

36:39.531 --> 36:41.132
I know what I was missing.

36:49.908 --> 36:52.444
(groaning)

36:54.212 --> 36:55.180
RITA:
Shit.

36:55.213 --> 36:57.616
Your hitchhiking days are over.

36:57.649 --> 36:59.918
Asshole.

37:04.923 --> 37:06.425
What are you doing?

37:06.458 --> 37:08.460
This is as far as you go.

37:08.494 --> 37:09.728
Redwood's close enough.

37:09.761 --> 37:11.630
I can walk it
the rest of the way.

37:12.664 --> 37:14.933
You've done more than enough.

37:19.771 --> 37:20.839
Wait.

37:23.008 --> 37:24.676
I'm coming with you.

37:26.244 --> 37:28.113
I need to see this through
to the end.

37:31.483 --> 37:35.253
("Too Shy" by Kajagoogoo
playing)

37:40.125 --> 37:42.828
(humming)

37:54.640 --> 37:56.007
Who the hell are you?

37:57.108 --> 37:59.277
I'm your biggest fan.

37:59.311 --> 38:01.079
What, you want a...

38:01.112 --> 38:02.881
an autograph or something?

38:05.617 --> 38:07.953
-We already have it.
-We?

38:11.189 --> 38:13.492
When you sign a contract
with the devil...

38:14.660 --> 38:17.463
...you better understand
the fine print.

38:17.496 --> 38:19.665
Oh, shit.

38:19.698 --> 38:24.636
* You're too shy, shy,
hush-hush, eye to eye *

38:24.670 --> 38:27.639
-* Too shy, shy, hush-hush... *
-Guys?

38:27.673 --> 38:31.643
I brought you some goodies.

38:31.677 --> 38:33.479
* Hush-hush, eye to eye *

38:33.512 --> 38:34.713
* Too shy, shy *

38:34.746 --> 38:36.147
Oh, God.

38:36.181 --> 38:37.983
* Hush-hush, eye to eye... *

38:41.887 --> 38:43.154
(whimpering)

38:43.188 --> 38:45.190
* Too shy, shy *

38:45.223 --> 38:47.025
* Hush-hush, eye to eye *

38:47.058 --> 38:51.663
* Too shy, shy, hush-hush,
eye to eye *

38:51.697 --> 38:54.199
* Too shy, shy. *

38:55.701 --> 38:58.804
LAVINIA:
You shouldn't be here.

38:58.837 --> 39:02.408
You don't deserve to sit
in the place where he died.

39:02.441 --> 39:05.043
You've already taken
so much from me.

39:05.076 --> 39:08.380
I won't allow you to take away
my place to mourn him.

39:08.414 --> 39:10.882
You don't get a claim
on missing him.

39:10.916 --> 39:12.618
I miss him all the time.

39:15.186 --> 39:17.055
I think about him every day.

39:19.224 --> 39:21.760
I even named my son after him.

39:23.529 --> 39:26.598
Bobby. He's...

39:29.768 --> 39:32.471
He's gonna grow up to be
headstrong, just like Bobby.

39:37.809 --> 39:40.278
You should go
and be with your son.

39:40.311 --> 39:42.280
I can't.

39:42.313 --> 39:45.216
-I need to face Ramirez.
-You're a fool.

39:45.250 --> 39:48.253
He's in league with forces...

39:48.286 --> 39:50.088
you cannot match.

39:50.121 --> 39:51.457
I know.

39:52.724 --> 39:56.562
But... what kind of man
would I be

39:56.595 --> 39:59.831
if I didn't do everything
I could to protect my son?

40:13.645 --> 40:17.382
You made a deal with the devil.

40:17.415 --> 40:20.151
And Ramirez is here to collect.

40:20.185 --> 40:24.089
If you die by his hand,

40:24.122 --> 40:26.958
he'll make sure
you don't come back.

40:26.992 --> 40:29.661
But if you die by your own...

40:31.497 --> 40:34.365
...you'll come back forever.

40:43.041 --> 40:44.743
(Mr. Jingles breathing heavily)

40:44.776 --> 40:47.145
If you truly want
to protect him...

40:48.379 --> 40:51.149
...you'll do
what has to be done.

41:09.868 --> 41:12.638
Bobby?

41:13.705 --> 41:16.307
I know you're out there.

41:16.341 --> 41:18.510
If you can hear me...

41:20.011 --> 41:22.648
I'm sorry.

41:24.482 --> 41:27.352
And I won't curse my son

41:27.385 --> 41:29.487
the way I cursed you.

41:33.324 --> 41:35.493
(grunts)
