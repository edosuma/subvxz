01:20.814 --> 01:23.849
( speaking hebrew )

01:26.319 --> 01:28.420
( loud laughter )

01:31.658 --> 01:33.325
Damn.

01:36.096 --> 01:38.230
<i>( loud chatter )</i>

01:39.199 --> 01:41.100
( woofs )

01:41.134 --> 01:43.035
- ( thumps )
- oi!

01:46.706 --> 01:49.224
- they woke you too?
- yep.

01:49.259 --> 01:51.643
You know
that big yoni guy
uses my toilet?

01:51.678 --> 01:53.612
- yep.
- and he leaves floaters!

01:53.646 --> 01:55.914
- i didn't know that.
- what are we gonna do?

01:55.949 --> 01:58.317
Talk to aaron.
i called him, he's on his way.

01:59.552 --> 02:01.453
- you seen my fruit loops?
- nope.

02:01.488 --> 02:04.256
Big yoni's
eating them outside.

02:04.290 --> 02:07.826
<i>- turtle: this guy's
pushing me.
- bagel broker.</i>

02:07.861 --> 02:10.395
- nice!
- what is with your face?

02:10.413 --> 02:13.799
They surprised me
with a new scene when i got
to the set last night--

02:13.833 --> 02:16.568
Battery acid sprays
out of my car engine.

02:16.603 --> 02:21.473
Four hours
of makeup for one line,
compliments of dan coakley.

02:21.508 --> 02:24.343
- why didn't you take it off?
- i've got to shoot
again tonight.

02:24.377 --> 02:26.578
I can't bear
another session
in the makeup chair.

02:26.613 --> 02:29.348
- now you've got two bad sides.
- don't start with me, turtle.

02:29.382 --> 02:31.150
- i'm exhausted.
- oh, you are?!

02:31.184 --> 02:34.019
We've got the israeli army
waking us up all night
and you can go home!

02:34.053 --> 02:36.104
Baby bro was hungry
and you can go to jamie's.

02:36.139 --> 02:39.541
- i'm a friend who doesn't
leave his boy in crisis.
- appreciate that, turtle.

02:39.576 --> 02:41.693
Since jamie's
a little too scared
to sleep here,

02:41.728 --> 02:43.562
I'm having a little
crisis of my own.

02:43.596 --> 02:46.465
You've gone
years without pussy,
a couple days won't kill you.

02:46.499 --> 02:49.201
- shut your mouth, acid face!
- you want to go?

02:49.235 --> 02:51.270
- yeah, i do!
- don't fucking get in my face.

02:51.304 --> 02:53.372
- whoa whoa whoa!
- you're disgusting.

02:53.406 --> 02:55.774
- you boys okay?
- actually no, we're not.

02:55.808 --> 02:59.077
- he started it.
- one of your goons
ate my fruit loops.

02:59.112 --> 03:01.446
The same goon keeps
pummeling my toilet.

03:01.481 --> 03:04.383
- i'm sorry.  i'll talk to him.
- and i thought your man outside

03:04.417 --> 03:06.818
Was gonna shoot me
when i pulled up
this morning.

03:06.853 --> 03:09.755
- it's makeup.
- aaron, i think everyone's
a little tense

03:09.789 --> 03:12.057
With all the people
around the house constantly.

03:12.091 --> 03:14.726
How much longer do you
think we're gonna have
this much security?

03:14.761 --> 03:16.795
I can scale it back
if that's what you want.

03:16.829 --> 03:21.049
But i think you should hear
what we found on this guy
before you make that decision.

03:21.084 --> 03:25.854
- here's a report.
he has a few arrests.
- he tried to kill his father?

03:25.905 --> 03:28.323
As a child, he had
an affinity for setting fires.

03:28.358 --> 03:30.709
At the age of 12,
he burned down his house,

03:30.743 --> 03:33.779
Badly injuring his father.
he was questioned and cleared.

03:33.813 --> 03:35.864
- jesus.
- creepy.

03:35.915 --> 03:38.951
- we'll keep the security.
- it shouldn't be
for much longer.

03:38.985 --> 03:42.004
We have this guy
under 24-hour surveillance.

03:42.038 --> 03:44.389
<i>- so what should we do?
- what you normally do.</i>

03:44.424 --> 03:47.626
<i>- well, i have a fitting today.
- no worries.</i>

03:47.660 --> 03:51.780
Live your life as usual.
my guys will be there just
in case of any surprises.

03:51.814 --> 03:54.182
- i'll be there too, bro.
- appreciate it, johnny.

03:54.217 --> 03:57.069
- but lose the makeup, huh?
- no can do.

03:57.103 --> 03:59.321
Okay.  turtle,
you want to come also?

03:59.355 --> 04:02.124
- i got class.
- so much for you
being a good friend.

04:02.158 --> 04:05.394
- i have a perfect
attendance record.
- it's okay, you go to class.

04:05.428 --> 04:07.763
But do me a favor, call e,
have him to meet me there

04:07.797 --> 04:10.832
- because it looks
like i have a ride.
- you got it, boss.

04:13.169 --> 04:15.704
( phone ringing )

04:18.190 --> 04:19.690
Hello?

04:19.726 --> 04:21.709
<i>- yo, wake up.
- what time is it?</i>

04:21.744 --> 04:23.428
<i>i don't know, 7-something.</i>

04:23.463 --> 04:25.597
<i>- are you alone?
- no.</i>

04:25.632 --> 04:27.866
<i>- ashley?
- who else?</i>

04:27.900 --> 04:32.020
- with you, who knows?
- she wake you up with
a morning b.j., e?

04:32.055 --> 04:34.473
<i>- eric: what's up?
- drama: tell her she should.</i>

04:34.507 --> 04:35.891
What's up?

04:35.925 --> 04:38.176
Vince wanted me to tell you
to meet him at the fitting.

04:38.210 --> 04:41.296
- sounds good.
- not as good as a morning b.j.

04:41.331 --> 04:43.632
Okay, i gotta go.
i'll talk to you later.

04:45.217 --> 04:48.387
- who was that?
- it was turtle.

04:48.421 --> 04:51.106
Oh, what did he want?

04:51.157 --> 04:53.909
Just to tell me that i have
to meet vince at the fitting.

04:53.943 --> 04:55.627
I gotta get up.

04:55.662 --> 04:57.896
Eric, was that...

04:57.914 --> 05:00.182
Really turtle?

05:01.084 --> 05:02.334
Yeah, why?

05:02.368 --> 05:04.936
'cause you were talking
really weird on the phone.

05:04.971 --> 05:07.606
- weird?
- cryptic, short answers,

05:07.640 --> 05:09.308
Like you were
hiding something.

05:09.342 --> 05:11.710
I wasn't hiding anything.
you want to know the truth?

05:11.744 --> 05:13.512
Yeah.

05:13.546 --> 05:16.631
Well, he was saying
some stupid things,
that's why.

05:16.683 --> 05:19.084
Like what?

05:19.102 --> 05:21.853
- like drama wanted to know
if you woke me up--
- wait, drama?

05:21.888 --> 05:24.740
- i thought it was turtle.
- drama got on the phone
and he wanted to know

05:24.774 --> 05:27.242
If you woke me up
with a-- you know.

05:27.276 --> 05:29.561
- you know.
- ahh.

05:29.595 --> 05:31.646
He's an idiot that's why
i was being cryptic.

05:31.698 --> 05:34.900
I hate when my friends do
stuff like that.  i'm sorry,
i don't mean to be crazy.

05:34.934 --> 05:37.602
Don't be sorry.
i gotta jump in the shower.

05:37.637 --> 05:39.454
( groans )

05:51.751 --> 05:54.319
<i>- i know it's annoying, vinnie.
- do you?</i>

05:54.354 --> 05:56.722
Two guys following
behind me, my every move.

05:56.756 --> 05:59.991
You usually have three.
the only difference is your
idiots aren't armed.

06:00.026 --> 06:03.095
- you're always a help, ari.
- i'm sorry, vinnie.
it'll be over soon.

06:03.129 --> 06:04.396
- enjoy darabont.
- i will.

06:04.430 --> 06:05.764
<i>- later.
- later.</i>

06:05.798 --> 06:07.766
<i>- lloyd: morning, mr. gold.
- morning, slave.</i>

06:07.800 --> 06:09.735
I trust you heard that
adam davies was promoted

06:09.769 --> 06:11.870
- to the head of his
talent department.
- i did.

06:11.904 --> 06:14.206
And i was preparing
to send him feces.

06:14.240 --> 06:16.475
- no?
- no, but i like
the proactive thought.

06:16.509 --> 06:19.044
- just get him on the phone
and zac too.
- zac who?

06:19.078 --> 06:22.480
Zac who-you-don't-
get-to-know-his-name-
because-you-are-a-peasant.

06:22.498 --> 06:24.332
Oh good god,
abs alert.

06:24.367 --> 06:27.002
Don't whack off to
the sound of his voice.
chop chop.

06:27.036 --> 06:29.621
What could you
possibly want, ari?

06:29.655 --> 06:31.606
I just wanted
to congratulate you

06:31.641 --> 06:33.708
On making it
to the top of the gestapo.

06:33.743 --> 06:35.710
You really want anything?

06:35.762 --> 06:39.047
- no, but your ex-client does.
- what ex-client?

06:39.098 --> 06:43.034
- connect him, lloyd!
- mr. efron, you're on with
mr. gold and mr. davies.

06:43.069 --> 06:45.771
- hello.
- ...zac!

06:45.805 --> 06:47.222
Buddy, what's up?

06:47.273 --> 06:48.974
You think you can
leverage me, adam?

06:49.008 --> 06:51.693
<i>- what are you talking about?
- you promised disney</i>

06:51.727 --> 06:53.862
I'd do a shirtless lunchbox
if they gave the rock

06:53.896 --> 06:57.532
<i>- an extra five mil
for "witch 2."
- a shirtless lunchbox?</i>

06:57.567 --> 06:59.801
<i>- no, it's not happening.
- davies: zac,</i>

06:59.836 --> 07:02.170
<i>- that was a joke.
- you're a joke.</i>

07:02.205 --> 07:04.739

- my girl here is
a really big fan.

07:04.774 --> 07:07.309

<i>i'm with ari now.
- gut yontif!</i>

07:29.449 --> 07:31.817

Beautiful work, zac,
beautiful.

07:33.953 --> 07:35.887
<i>you are now my new
favorite client.</i>

07:35.922 --> 07:39.157
I cannot wait
to get you a producer credit
on "college musical."

07:39.192 --> 07:41.426
That's hilarious, ari.
how about a signing present?

07:41.461 --> 07:43.562
Something with four wheels
and leather seats.

07:43.596 --> 07:45.597
Consider it done,
my friend.  later.

07:45.631 --> 07:48.467

by the way.

07:48.501 --> 07:51.937
I'm really
sorry.

07:51.971 --> 07:53.872
Ashley doesn't
trust me.

07:53.906 --> 07:56.808
I never had a girl
that trusted me.
it sucks.

07:56.843 --> 07:59.144
Yeah, but e's as
trustworthy as they get.

07:59.178 --> 08:01.913
- he's like a toyota.
- i did lie to her about
sloan calling me.

08:01.948 --> 08:04.316
<i>- look, e, do you really
like this girl?
- yeah, i do.</i>

08:04.350 --> 08:06.585
Then you're gonna have
to earn back her trust.

08:06.619 --> 08:09.087
Never happen.
girls have memories
like elephants.

08:09.121 --> 08:12.591
You get caught lying once,
you're done, no matter
what they tell you.

08:12.625 --> 08:14.993
- what do you know
about relationships?
- everything.

08:15.027 --> 08:17.796
I agree with vince.
i think if you're a good guy
you can prove it.

08:17.830 --> 08:19.464
- thank you.
- please.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.333
<i>- vincent!

I'm so excited.
i really want to get
back to work.

08:35.214 --> 08:37.549
You and me both.
the sets are almost
completely rebuilt.

08:37.582 --> 08:39.484
<i>- ( phone rings )
- they're real--
who are these guys?</i>

08:39.519 --> 08:41.553
<i>eric:
oh, we're having a bit
of a security issue.</i>

08:41.587 --> 08:43.221
Don't worry, it won't
affect the movie.

08:43.256 --> 08:44.823
<i>- mr. chase?
- yeah?</i>

08:44.857 --> 08:47.292
That was aaron.
we momentarily lost track
of our target.

08:47.326 --> 08:50.529
- he would like you to come
back home for the time being.
- how do you lose a tail?

08:50.563 --> 08:52.731
It's okay.
i'll finish up
the fitting.

08:52.765 --> 08:55.200
- nothing's going to happen.
- whoa whoa whoa.

08:55.234 --> 08:59.237
- vince, what's going on?
- i think i might have
a stalker.

08:59.272 --> 09:01.439
<i>- eric: we don't know that yet.
- a stalker?</i>

09:01.474 --> 09:03.008
Not good, man, listen,

09:03.042 --> 09:06.011
After "shawshank" came out,
i got all these letters
from convicts--

09:06.045 --> 09:08.580
Most very complimentary,
but there was this one guy,

09:08.614 --> 09:11.349
Sent me like 50 letters
saying that when he got out

09:11.384 --> 09:14.085
He was going to
shawshank me in the ass.

09:14.120 --> 09:15.820
Who couldn't
love that movie?

09:15.855 --> 09:17.689
- so what happened?
- the guy got paroled.

09:17.723 --> 09:19.591
Sure enough, one day
he shows up on my doorstep.

09:19.625 --> 09:21.259
- jesus.
- what'd you do?

09:21.294 --> 09:23.995
- i shot him.
- ( laughs ) oh, frank.

09:24.030 --> 09:25.964
No no, i'm serious.
i shot him in the ass.

09:25.998 --> 09:28.066
- here.
- hey hey hey.

09:28.100 --> 09:31.069
- it's okay, he's a director.
- relax, fellas, i know
what i'm doing.

09:31.103 --> 09:33.772
Safety's on, take this one.
i got a whole bunch
more at home.

09:33.806 --> 09:35.807
Oh no, we've already had
a bit of a gun issue.

09:35.841 --> 09:37.876
- really?
- it was turtle's fault.

09:37.910 --> 09:40.712
- you sure?
- yes, thank you.

09:40.746 --> 09:43.181
All right, but i'm
telling you something:

09:43.215 --> 09:45.951
Shit like this is not to be
trifled with, my friend.

09:45.985 --> 09:48.219
My advice to you,
listen to your israelis.

09:48.254 --> 09:50.889
Go home.
we can always do this fitting
some other time, yeah?

09:50.923 --> 09:54.159

up at the house.
- vince?

09:54.193 --> 09:57.128
- at the house will be fine.
- wonderful.  at the house
is fine.

09:57.163 --> 09:59.331
Good, thank you, fellas.
thank you, everybody.

09:59.365 --> 10:02.901
Vince, seriously,
paranoia.

10:02.935 --> 10:05.704
That's all i'm saying.

10:05.738 --> 10:07.639
Yeah.

10:10.876 --> 10:15.180

- ari gold's office.

10:15.214 --> 10:18.083

- oh-- hi.

10:18.117 --> 10:19.651
Uh, let me see
if i can get mr. gold.

10:19.685 --> 10:21.353
<i>i'm not calling
for ari, lloyd.</i>

10:21.387 --> 10:24.689
- i'm calling for you.
- oh.

10:24.724 --> 10:27.125
- are you happy there?
- happy?

10:27.159 --> 10:29.160
<i>how would you like
to come work for me?</i>

10:29.195 --> 10:31.630
How would you like
to finally be an agent?

10:31.664 --> 10:34.649
<i>- would this be just so you
could get back at ari?
- no, lloyd.</i>

10:34.684 --> 10:36.551
Getting back at ari
is the bonus.

10:36.585 --> 10:39.688
<i>- that's not great
motivation for me.
- three-year contract.</i>

10:39.722 --> 10:41.623
Triple what you're making,
i'm sure.

10:41.657 --> 10:43.558
<i>come in, we'll discuss.</i>

10:43.592 --> 10:45.327
I'm sorry,
but i can't do that.

10:45.361 --> 10:48.463
If that's a personal call
you're on, lloyd, i'm going
to waterboard you.

10:48.497 --> 10:50.265
- i have to go.
- who was that?

10:50.299 --> 10:53.201
<i>- my mother.
- andrew: ari!</i>

10:53.235 --> 10:56.371
Aaron sorkin is signed,
sealed and delivered.

10:56.405 --> 10:58.473
Beautiful!
you hear that, lloyd?

10:58.507 --> 11:01.409
- yes, congratulations.
- now take a good look
at this man.

11:01.444 --> 11:05.280
All right, now what do you
see in him that you don't
see in yourself?

11:06.282 --> 11:07.716
I don't know.

11:07.750 --> 11:09.250
- a purpose.
- ( andrew laughs )

11:09.285 --> 11:11.419
Now call your mother and tell
her that you don't have one.

11:11.454 --> 11:13.054
- all right?  lunch?
- great.

11:13.089 --> 11:15.340
Slave, call the grill and tell
them we're on our way.

11:17.143 --> 11:21.179
<i>- ( phone rings )
- ari gold's office.</i>

11:21.213 --> 11:25.250
- have you
reconsidered yet, lloyd?
- i'm happy here, really.

11:25.284 --> 11:27.852
This offer won't
last forever.

11:27.887 --> 11:30.255
<i>tick tock.</i>

11:32.992 --> 11:37.028
How can i be calm when
baby bro's safety is in
the hands of inept gorillas?

11:37.063 --> 11:39.764
- please control your man, eric.
- would you calm down, please?

11:39.798 --> 11:43.268
No, i can't calm down when
we're locked up in here
like wild animals.

11:43.302 --> 11:45.937
You're not locked up.
you're free to leave
whenever you want.

11:45.971 --> 11:49.074
I don't get why you
just didn't have this guy
arrested in the first place.

11:49.108 --> 11:51.359
'cause we have
no actual proof
it was him who broke in.

11:51.410 --> 11:53.845
Then you should have had
your goons stick hhoin the trunk

11:53.879 --> 11:56.414
- and give him an
israeli-type warning.
- you watch too much tv!

11:56.449 --> 11:58.950
Drama, would you let
the professionals do
their jobs, please?

11:58.984 --> 12:01.136
Fine.
do your job.

12:01.170 --> 12:03.938
Thank you.
so what does this guy
do anyway?

12:03.973 --> 12:07.909
- he works in a retail shop.
- which one?  maybe we've
crossed paths with him before.

12:07.943 --> 12:11.746
Do you spend a lot
of time in a place called
the pleasure chest?

12:13.265 --> 12:15.133
- great mother of god.
- he does.

12:15.167 --> 12:18.353
Do you have any idea how sick
this guy must be if he works
at the pleasure chest?

12:18.387 --> 12:20.939
Why?  you used
to spend more time there
than the employees.

12:20.973 --> 12:23.508
Yeah, so what?
he's a stalker, i'm not.

12:23.526 --> 12:27.712
And he has an unlimited access
to dildoes and restraints
and this guy lost him!

12:27.747 --> 12:29.981
<i>but we have vince
which is most important.</i>

12:30.015 --> 12:31.950
I'm not feeling
like you have anything.

12:31.984 --> 12:34.068
You want me to make
you feel something?

12:34.120 --> 12:37.021
<i>- guys.
- fine fine.</i>

12:37.039 --> 12:40.141
I'll let
the professionals
do their job.

12:40.176 --> 12:41.810
I'm gonna go take a nap.

12:41.844 --> 12:44.212
That one is
a loose cannon.

12:47.616 --> 12:51.252
( rings )

12:51.303 --> 12:53.238
Pleasure chest,
this is sadie.

12:53.272 --> 12:55.473
Hey, sadie, i don't know
if you remember me?

12:55.508 --> 12:59.310
I don't remember you,
i won't have phone sex with you
and i'm a lesbian.

12:59.345 --> 13:01.712
<i>- no no no, this is
johnny chase.  we--
- drama?</i>

13:01.730 --> 13:03.815
- yeah!
- holy shit, man.
how are you?

13:03.849 --> 13:07.035
<i>- good good.
- haven't seen you sinceou
made it big on the network.</i>

13:07.069 --> 13:09.254
<i>yeah, well, i can't really
be rolling in there</i>

13:09.288 --> 13:11.389
<i>- now that i'm a public figure.
- ( moaning )</i>

13:11.407 --> 13:13.792
( scoffs )
jeez, drama, turn down
the porn, will ya?

13:13.826 --> 13:16.194
- ( moaning )
- no, that's not porn.

13:16.228 --> 13:18.947
- it's vince.
- oh, guess he's good.

13:18.998 --> 13:21.783
<i>- yeah, he's great.
- sweet.  so what's up?</i>

13:21.834 --> 13:24.452
Look, i wanted to ask you about
an employee-- curtis tucker.

13:24.487 --> 13:26.638
<i>- what about him?
- what do you know about him?</i>

13:26.672 --> 13:29.407
Not much.
quiet, keeps to himself.

13:29.425 --> 13:32.210
- why?
- i think he's got a hard-on
for my baby'sro.

13:32.244 --> 13:33.678
( snickers )
who doesn't?

13:33.712 --> 13:36.514
No, not that kind of a hard-on.
more of a stalkerish nature.

13:36.549 --> 13:39.184
Yeah, it wouldn't shock me.
kid is creepy.

13:39.218 --> 13:41.419
<i>- have you seen him?
- not since yesterday, no.</i>

13:41.453 --> 13:44.522
But i think he switched shifts
so he should be around
at, like, 4:00.

13:44.557 --> 13:46.508
Great.
maybe i'll be there too.

13:46.542 --> 13:49.060
You're not going
to cause trouble,
now are you, drama?

13:49.094 --> 13:52.363
- would you like it if i did?
- you know it.

13:52.398 --> 13:54.315
Although i am still
recovering from you

13:54.366 --> 13:56.484
Dislocating my pinkie
at that s&m seminar.

13:56.535 --> 13:59.304
( laughs )
maybe i'll make it
up to you.  ciao.

14:00.940 --> 14:02.991
Hey.

14:03.042 --> 14:03.992
Hey.

14:04.043 --> 14:06.544
- hey.
- everything fit okay?

14:06.579 --> 14:08.546
- yeah.
- i gotta run to the set.

14:08.581 --> 14:10.548
- okay.
- i thought you were
taking a nap?

14:10.583 --> 14:12.834
<i>- later!
- later.</i>

14:12.885 --> 14:17.105
Tom, i don't know if it's
a real offer or not.  i'm just
telling you what was said.

14:17.139 --> 14:18.439
Lloyd!

14:18.474 --> 14:20.508
- i gotta go.
- lloyd!

14:20.543 --> 14:22.727
Coming, mr. gold.

14:22.761 --> 14:25.630
- yes, sir.
- i just spilled water
all over my keyboard.

14:25.664 --> 14:28.833
- why?
- because you were so busy, you
accidentally knocked it over

14:28.868 --> 14:33.004
No, because the only water
that is available is in
these stupid little cups.

14:33.038 --> 14:34.672
No bottles.
where are the bottles?

14:34.707 --> 14:37.775
In the landfill.
you said you wanted
to be more green.

14:37.810 --> 14:39.878
That's because leo
was in earshot.

14:39.912 --> 14:43.248
- i will switch out
your keyboard right away.
- good.

14:43.282 --> 14:46.284
Wait till i'm out of the office
before you get on your knees.

14:47.686 --> 14:50.388
<i>- ari-- mr. gold.
- what?</i>

14:51.924 --> 14:54.192
- you know it's been 50 days.
- 50 days.

14:54.226 --> 14:58.830
You said 100 days of hell
and then i'd be an agent.
it's been 50.

14:58.864 --> 15:01.432
So i just want to make sure
we're still on track.

15:03.835 --> 15:06.421
- still on track?
- that nothing's changed?

15:06.455 --> 15:08.806
Are you seriously
questioning me?

15:08.840 --> 15:12.911
I'm just asking.
because today i was
offered a job.

15:14.246 --> 15:17.415
<i>- you were offered a job?
- a real job, ari.</i>

15:17.449 --> 15:20.218
To be an agent,
which of course is what
i've always wanted--

15:20.252 --> 15:22.787
But to be an agent for you!
so i just want to make sure

15:22.821 --> 15:24.689
That i'm still going
to be in 50 days.

15:24.723 --> 15:26.291
- i just added 10 days.
- ari, no!

15:26.325 --> 15:28.059
10 more!
you want to keep
questioning me?

15:28.093 --> 15:30.995
- ari, i just--
- or keep telling me about
your other job opportunities.

15:31.030 --> 15:34.532
- ari!
- it's "mr. gold"
for 70-- now 80!

15:34.550 --> 15:36.334
<i>or you can go ahead
and represent</i>

15:36.368 --> 15:38.803
Dancing chihuahuas
or whatever your offer is.

15:38.837 --> 15:40.805
Go ahead,
keep questioning me.
i dare you.

15:40.839 --> 15:42.690
- please.
- 90 days.

15:42.725 --> 15:45.426
This is not
"the breakfast club,"
mr. gold, this is my life.

15:45.461 --> 15:47.996
100 days.
you want 10 more?

15:48.030 --> 15:50.431
- you just got them.
- for what?

15:50.466 --> 15:52.233
For what you
were thinking.

15:52.267 --> 15:55.486
Now i've got chores for you
when you're done cleaning up
my keyboard.

15:55.521 --> 15:58.990
Get my car, have it washed.
go get my dry cleaning,
bring it to my house,

15:59.024 --> 16:01.559
Clean up all the dogshit
and my neighbor's.

16:01.577 --> 16:04.245
<i>don't you ever question
my word again!</i>

16:06.215 --> 16:09.133
- go.
- yes, sir.

16:11.003 --> 16:13.438
<i>- what do you mean
they lost him?
- drama: just what i said.</i>

16:13.472 --> 16:16.341
Now they're
following me around
as if i'm the problem.

16:16.375 --> 16:18.343
<i>- am i supposed to go home?
- no no no.</i>

16:18.377 --> 16:20.178
I got the situation
under control.

16:20.212 --> 16:21.813
( giggling )

16:21.847 --> 16:24.215
I'm sure you do.
did i look weird today?

16:24.249 --> 16:26.417
Like i memorize you
every morning.

16:26.452 --> 16:28.419
What do you need, drama?

16:28.454 --> 16:30.154
I need you to call the house,

16:30.189 --> 16:32.223
Tell cohn that you need
a man with you.

16:32.257 --> 16:34.492
- why?
- so i can give this perv

16:34.526 --> 16:36.561
A good old-fashioned
new york warning.

16:36.595 --> 16:38.329
- i--
- hey.

16:38.364 --> 16:39.831
- i'm brooke.
- hi.

16:39.865 --> 16:42.133
<i>- turtle, are you
listening to me?
- yes.</i>

16:42.167 --> 16:44.502
- i have a homework question.
- are you in my class?

16:44.536 --> 16:46.904
No.
i'll ask you later.

16:46.939 --> 16:50.041
- ask me what?
- turtle, will you stop
sializing and call aaron?

16:50.075 --> 16:53.177
<i>do you really want to sit
around and wait for this guy
to come to us?</i>

16:53.212 --> 16:56.347
- what the hell?
- is that what we are--
passive pussies?

16:56.382 --> 16:58.783
My break's over.
i've got to get to class.

16:58.801 --> 17:01.753
<i>- come on, turtle!
- fine!  later.</i>

17:01.787 --> 17:04.454
I'm coming as soon as
your car is washed.

17:04.490 --> 17:07.258
- you haven't done that yet?
- it's only been 30 minutes,
mr. gold.

17:07.291 --> 17:08.726
I'm moving
as fast as i can.

17:08.761 --> 17:11.095
If you would have dropped
the weight like i told you to,

17:11.130 --> 17:12.829
You'd be a little mo aerody.

17:12.865 --> 17:15.900
I wanted to do it last so it
was as fresh as possible.

17:15.934 --> 17:18.102
Jesus christ,
10 more days.

17:18.137 --> 17:20.671
- ari, why?
- because you're weak, lloyd.

17:20.705 --> 17:23.374
<i>- i am not.
- don't cry.</i>

17:23.409 --> 17:25.326
- i am not crying!
- because i will add

17:25.359 --> 17:27.962
A whole new lifetime
if you start crying.

17:27.996 --> 17:31.099
- i am not crying, ari.
- it's "mr. gold."

17:31.133 --> 17:33.701
I'm not fucking crying,
mr. gold!

17:33.736 --> 17:35.670
<i>( shouts )
oh my god!</i>

17:35.704 --> 17:37.338
- what happened?
- i've been hit.

17:37.372 --> 17:39.474
<i>- what?
- you've been hit--
rear-ended.</i>

17:39.508 --> 17:40.942
<i>- oh god.
- jesus christ!</i>

17:40.976 --> 17:43.411
- are you kidding me?!
- ari, it wasn't my fault.

17:43.445 --> 17:46.280
- everything is your fault.
- it's your fault

17:46.315 --> 17:48.683
Because you accused me
of crying when i wasn't

17:48.717 --> 17:50.485
And accused me
of being weak
when i'm not!

17:50.519 --> 17:53.254
You're blaming me for you
crashing my car?

17:53.288 --> 17:56.557
<i>- i'm blaming you
for ruining my life!
- ( honking )</i>

17:56.592 --> 18:00.094
Get your ass back here
before you say something
you're going to regret.

18:00.129 --> 18:02.530
I regret ever having
met you, ari gold.

18:02.564 --> 18:05.733
Your car is on wilshire
and crescent waiting for you.

18:05.768 --> 18:09.370
- you're abandoning it?!
- yes, and i'm abandoning you!

18:09.404 --> 18:12.373
<i>- lloyd?  lloyd!
- ( honking )</i>

18:12.407 --> 18:14.041
( screams )

18:19.331 --> 18:20.998
Johnny drama.

18:21.033 --> 18:23.835
Hey, sadie,

18:26.688 --> 18:29.924
- it's makeup.
- sexy.

18:29.958 --> 18:32.393
- is he here yet?
- no, not yet.

18:32.427 --> 18:34.712
- why don't you browse?
- cool.

18:34.730 --> 18:36.948
I'll be in bondage.

18:38.016 --> 18:39.817
I'll sneak away
when i can.

18:42.521 --> 18:44.522
You want
to double tonight?

18:44.556 --> 18:46.223
With who?
you and the clothing girl?

18:46.241 --> 18:48.326
- she's cool.
- you've known her
for 20 minutes.

18:48.360 --> 18:50.461
- how do you know?
- good instincts.

18:50.496 --> 18:54.031
I think i gotta go alone.
i've got some work
to do with ashley.

18:54.066 --> 18:57.301
<i>- ( phone ringing )
- speaking of which.</i>

18:58.704 --> 19:00.788
Are your ears burning?
we were talking about you.

19:00.839 --> 19:02.957
<i>- where are you?
- i'm at vince's.</i>

19:03.008 --> 19:05.075
I thought you were gonna be
at the office all day.

19:05.093 --> 19:07.628
Yeah, i thought so too,
but something came up.
where are you?

19:07.679 --> 19:09.347
<i>- at your office.
- oh.</i>

19:09.381 --> 19:12.082
<i>- i wanted to surprise you.
- oh, i'm sorry.</i>

19:12.100 --> 19:15.052
I met your assistant.

19:15.086 --> 19:17.188
Vince, we've got
a problem.

19:17.222 --> 19:19.256
There's a problem here.
can i call you back?

19:19.274 --> 19:21.042
Um... yeah, sure!

19:21.076 --> 19:22.777
<i>- bye.
- what happened?</i>

19:22.811 --> 19:24.779
Your crazy brother is
inside the pleasure chest.

19:24.813 --> 19:27.899
We've got sight of our
main suspect.  he's pulling
up there right now.

19:27.933 --> 19:30.785

- and a dog.

20:25.290 --> 20:27.425
And you prefer
boxers to briefs.

20:27.459 --> 20:29.060
What the hell
is going on!

20:29.094 --> 20:31.562
They're all wearing
your underwear.

20:31.597 --> 20:34.532
- see?
- whoo!

20:34.566 --> 20:38.569
Our rush chairman told us we had
to steal jamie-lynn sigler's
boyfriend's underwear.

Sorry.

20:40.839 --> 20:44.075

my underwear?
- no, not me.

20:44.109 --> 20:46.477
I only wear thongs.

20:50.082 --> 20:52.650
- vincent chase!
- vincent chase.

20:52.684 --> 20:55.052
- what about him?
- admit it, you were
at his house.

20:55.087 --> 20:56.954
- i wasn't.
- you were.

20:56.989 --> 20:59.557
<i>- and i found your
license to prove it.
- ( phone ringing )</i>

20:59.591 --> 21:01.859
I lost
this license years ago.
where did you find it?

21:01.893 --> 21:04.395
- in the couch!
- where did you get the couch?

21:04.429 --> 21:06.564
- what does it matter?
- h.d. buttercup?

21:07.599 --> 21:09.066
Yeah, maybe.

21:09.101 --> 21:11.769
- how did you know?
- i used to sell
furniture there.

21:11.803 --> 21:15.506
- maybe it fell in.
- bullshit!  how long have
you been stalking vince?

21:15.540 --> 21:17.675
<i>sadie:
uh, johnny, vince is
on the phone.</i>

21:17.709 --> 21:21.045
He says to tell you it was all
a sorority prank on turtle.

21:21.063 --> 21:23.631
Here's my current
license.

21:23.665 --> 21:25.967
It's not lost, see?

21:27.936 --> 21:29.870
Oh.

21:31.222 --> 21:33.274
- ( laughing )
- who would have thought

21:33.308 --> 21:35.876
That a girl would want
to get in my underwear
before vince's?

21:35.911 --> 21:39.180
Who would have thought anyone
would have wanted to get
anywhere near your underwear?

21:39.214 --> 21:40.948
Don't be bitter because
i have more fans than you.

21:40.983 --> 21:43.084
<i>- eric: you gonna
tell jamie?
- no.</i>

21:43.118 --> 21:45.252
Drama stopped the real
stalker in my story.

21:45.287 --> 21:48.072
- good move.
- if he was the real one,
i would have stopped him.

21:48.106 --> 21:50.641
- trust me.
- vince: all right, guys, what
do you want to do tonight?

21:50.676 --> 21:53.044
- celebrate our freedom.
- e, you got ashley?

21:53.078 --> 21:54.879
I called her,
i haven't heard back yet.

21:54.913 --> 21:57.848
- i gotta work.
- i don't think that face would
do great in clubs anyway.

21:57.883 --> 22:00.134
I think that makeup's
bringing on some adult acne.

22:00.185 --> 22:03.137
- right?
- oh ho ho!

22:03.171 --> 22:06.774
- i'm gonna kill you, drama.
- you and what sorority sister?

22:06.808 --> 22:09.677
So, listen, vinnie,
i'm glad it all worked out.

22:09.711 --> 22:11.579
So are you gonna join us
out tonight?

22:11.613 --> 22:14.382
Naw, no can do.

here at the office.

22:14.416 --> 22:16.984

22:17.019 --> 22:19.420
<i>- okay, talk later.

22:31.633 --> 22:33.934
You want the truth?

22:33.969 --> 22:35.536

- uh, he won't.

22:35.570 --> 22:37.605
I killed him.

22:37.639 --> 22:39.907
I shot him and i buried him
underneath my desk.
