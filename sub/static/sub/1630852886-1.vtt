WEBVTT

00:54.721 --> 00:57.015
<i>We're 39 years old.</i>

00:57.098 --> 00:58.433
<i>We met when we were 18.</i>

00:58.516 --> 01:02.353
<i>And now, we're at an age
where getting a massage feels amazing.</i>

01:02.437 --> 01:04.230
You're not breaking my bones, right?

01:06.649 --> 01:09.444
<i>When we were 18,
we'd hang out and eat</i> tteokbokki.

01:10.028 --> 01:13.573
<i>But who knew we'd be doing
the same thing at the age of 39?</i>

01:14.324 --> 01:17.077
<i>The only difference is
we drink soju instead of Coke now.</i>

01:17.160 --> 01:20.288
Tteokbokki <i>is still
our favorite comfort food.</i>

01:21.748 --> 01:22.957
Here. Have this.

01:24.667 --> 01:25.502
Is it good?

01:35.011 --> 01:36.763
BEWARE OF BEES
FOLLOW SAFETY PRECAUTIONS

01:36.846 --> 01:38.431
1:57 P.M.

01:39.682 --> 01:41.100
We need to be careful.

01:41.184 --> 01:42.852
Or else, we'll get hurt.

01:42.936 --> 01:45.396
I sprained my ankle
while golfing yesterday.

01:45.480 --> 01:46.815
Then you can't hike.

01:47.690 --> 01:48.733
Do you want <i>baeksuk</i>?

01:48.817 --> 01:49.901
-Sure.
-Sure.

01:53.321 --> 01:55.198
<i>Ma'am, can we have a bottle of</i> makgeolli?

01:56.950 --> 01:58.910
<i>-Nothing has changed</i>
-Hey.

01:58.993 --> 02:00.703
<i>even though we're almost 40.</i>

02:01.538 --> 02:04.916
<i>Just that only high-end cosmetics
work on our skin,</i>

02:04.999 --> 02:07.001
<i>that we enjoy going to the sauna,</i>

02:07.085 --> 02:11.381
<i>and that we pay for our drinks
with our own money, not our parents'.</i>

02:11.464 --> 02:12.674
<i>That's about it.</i>

02:12.757 --> 02:13.675
<i>It's similar, right?</i>

02:15.385 --> 02:16.302
YOUR GOLF BUDDY

02:21.891 --> 02:22.934
Darn it.

02:23.017 --> 02:23.852
What's wrong?

02:24.477 --> 02:25.770
I accidentally pressed like.

02:25.854 --> 02:27.147
On what?

02:27.230 --> 02:28.565
A friend's pre-wedding photo.

02:28.648 --> 02:31.985
Darn it. This means I'll have
to give them congratulatory money.

02:32.068 --> 02:33.862
Poor you. Why did you do that?

02:33.945 --> 02:36.114
You should really quit social media.

02:38.199 --> 02:41.536
<i>We avoid weddings and baby birthdays
since we probably won't have them.</i>

02:41.619 --> 02:45.206
<i>But we do our best
to attend funerals because we're 39.</i>

02:45.290 --> 02:47.959
<i>That's what we've become.</i>

02:48.042 --> 02:49.043
What's wrong with her?

02:49.127 --> 02:50.503
-Good shot.
-Hey, the feathers.

02:50.587 --> 02:51.629
Darn it.

02:52.422 --> 02:54.799
Hey, do something else.

03:13.735 --> 03:17.155
<i>Thankfully, we found our soulmates</i>

03:17.238 --> 03:19.240
<i>and learned to love passionately.</i>

03:21.659 --> 03:22.785
<i>And…</i>

03:24.621 --> 03:27.957
<i>after being together for over 20 years,</i>

03:28.791 --> 03:31.586
<i>we had to say our first goodbyes.</i>

03:34.172 --> 03:40.178
<i>Never in our wildest dreams did we
expect a funeral to be held for one of us</i>

03:40.261 --> 03:41.429
<i>in our late thirties.</i>

03:44.015 --> 03:45.058
<i>We laughed…</i>

03:47.101 --> 03:48.686
<i>and cried a lot.</i>

03:49.437 --> 03:50.396
<i>This is…</i>

03:51.606 --> 03:54.817
<i>our passionate story.</i>

03:56.778 --> 04:02.659
THIRTY, NINE

04:03.243 --> 04:04.953
EPISODE 1

04:15.421 --> 04:18.383
-Yes?
-<i>Good morning, Dr. Cha.</i>

04:18.466 --> 04:20.927
<i>-Are you headed to work?</i>
-What's gotten into you?

04:21.010 --> 04:23.263
I should be nice
since I'm getting free treatment.

04:23.346 --> 04:26.349
I never said it was free.
I'm only giving you a discount.

04:27.016 --> 04:29.394
Then I'll pay in 100 installments.

04:29.477 --> 04:31.437
So Chan-young and I can go today, right?

04:31.521 --> 04:33.481
Didn't you already ask that last night?

04:33.564 --> 04:34.816
You're pretty forgetful.

04:34.899 --> 04:37.318
<i>You should call the person
who's even worse than me.</i>

04:37.819 --> 04:40.071
Oh, my bus is here. See you later.

04:40.822 --> 04:43.700
JOO-HEE

04:58.047 --> 04:59.007
What?

04:59.090 --> 05:01.968
Hey, don't forget we're visiting
Mi-jo's clinic today. Don't be late.

05:02.051 --> 05:04.345
<i>Did you have to call this early?</i>

05:04.429 --> 05:06.014
Of course. Don't be late.

05:06.097 --> 05:07.807
You messed up my day already.

05:09.142 --> 05:10.727
It's your fault if I'm late.

05:14.814 --> 05:15.898
Damn it.

05:21.154 --> 05:22.238
Good morning.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.406
Good morning.

05:24.657 --> 05:26.492
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

05:26.576 --> 05:27.702
Good morning, Dr. Cha.

05:27.785 --> 05:29.120
Good morning.

05:31.039 --> 05:33.166
-Dr. Cha.
-Yes?

05:33.249 --> 05:35.001
-Good morning.
-Hey.

05:35.877 --> 05:38.463
I heard a strange rumor.

05:38.546 --> 05:39.839
And what could that be?

05:39.922 --> 05:41.758
DIRECTOR CHA MI-JO
DERMATOLOGIST

05:41.841 --> 05:44.594
I heard we're going
to have a new director.

05:45.344 --> 05:47.388
It's temporary. It'll just be for a year.

05:47.472 --> 05:49.766
And what will you be doing
in the meantime?

05:50.391 --> 05:52.894
I'm going to study abroad.

05:54.437 --> 05:56.022
Studying abroad all of a sudden?

05:56.105 --> 05:58.191
Yes. To play golf.

05:58.274 --> 06:01.611
I'm going to take a one-year sabbatical.

06:03.780 --> 06:04.906
Without my permission?

06:05.615 --> 06:07.658
I worked like a dog
for the past five years.

06:07.742 --> 06:11.579
I'm going to take a break, get refreshed,
and come back to work.

06:14.499 --> 06:15.541
I'm telling Dad.

06:15.625 --> 06:17.043
Mi-hyeon, come on.

06:17.126 --> 06:19.712
You can't do that
when you just paid off the loan.

06:19.796 --> 06:21.380
That's exactly it.

06:21.464 --> 06:24.092
I think I deserve a break
since I paid it all.

06:24.175 --> 06:26.886
What about my money?
When will you pay me back?

06:26.969 --> 06:28.554
Have you forgotten?

06:28.638 --> 06:30.598
I paid eight <i>pyeong</i>'s worth
of this clinic.

06:30.681 --> 06:32.850
Then keep the clinic
and pay me every month.

06:38.481 --> 06:39.649
Darn it!

06:40.316 --> 06:43.694
Please don't charge the two women
who are coming this afternoon, Ms. Cha.

06:45.863 --> 06:48.032
I mean Chan-young and Joo-hee.

06:48.116 --> 06:50.743
We're celebrating my sabbatical.
A friendship event.

06:52.161 --> 06:54.789
Gosh. This is infuriating.

06:55.790 --> 06:57.125
I'm so enraged.

06:57.875 --> 06:59.001
It's the menopause.

07:00.044 --> 07:01.045
You're dead meat.

07:03.923 --> 07:06.759
I'm going to tell Dad
that you've begun to hit me.

07:06.843 --> 07:08.678
You can't do that to your adopted sister.

07:12.306 --> 07:15.685
Why did they have to adopt you,
not someone sweet?

07:17.687 --> 07:19.605
I'm aging faster thanks to you.

07:19.689 --> 07:21.858
Don't blame me
when you're an aging spinster.

07:21.941 --> 07:23.401
Look who's talking.

07:24.152 --> 07:25.153
But I'm not a spinster.

07:25.236 --> 07:26.529
Yes, you are.

07:26.612 --> 07:28.865
No, I'm not.
No one thinks that way about me.

07:28.948 --> 07:30.658
You're going to grow old too.

07:46.757 --> 07:48.926
Are you looking for something?

07:49.552 --> 07:50.845
Yes, serums.

07:50.928 --> 07:53.806
-I see. This way, please.
-Okay.

07:56.476 --> 07:57.643
How is it?

07:57.727 --> 07:58.644
It's nice.

07:58.728 --> 08:00.188
Isn't it very smooth?

08:05.485 --> 08:06.986
Is it already time for my Botox?

08:08.988 --> 08:10.781
It's quite ironic, isn't it?

08:11.949 --> 08:13.784
-What is?
-Look at you.

08:13.868 --> 08:16.913
You, an awful actor, get main roles
solely thanks to your looks.

08:16.996 --> 08:19.624
I'm the reason why you have a job.

08:19.707 --> 08:21.667
You little…

08:21.751 --> 08:23.127
There you go again.

08:25.046 --> 08:28.799
If I hear about your terrible acting
ever again, I'm going to mess you up.

08:28.883 --> 08:31.928
You always threaten me like that.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.348
Will you take care of me if you do that?

08:35.431 --> 08:37.558
That's enough. Open your script.

08:40.061 --> 08:43.356
HOW SHOULD WE INTERPRET CHARACTERS?
NOT ACTIONS, BUT REACTIONS

08:43.439 --> 08:45.525
-Next Wednesday…
-Dr. Cha will be done soon.

08:45.608 --> 08:46.817
-So please wait.
-Goodbye.

08:46.901 --> 08:48.528
-Okay.
-Thank you.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.159
I'm nervous.

08:55.785 --> 08:56.619
Why?

08:57.495 --> 08:58.746
This is my first time.

08:59.497 --> 09:01.791
What? Doesn't everyone know
that you're a virgin?

09:01.874 --> 09:03.751
What? Are you crazy?

09:03.834 --> 09:06.254
I meant this is
my first time getting fillers.

09:06.337 --> 09:08.965
-I see. I thought your virginity--
-Seriously?

09:09.048 --> 09:11.467
Be quiet! Are you crazy?

09:16.973 --> 09:18.808
Do your customers like those products?

09:18.891 --> 09:21.644
-Hey, Mi-hyeon.
-It's been a long time.

09:21.727 --> 09:22.603
How about here?

09:23.187 --> 09:24.146
They do like them.

09:25.106 --> 09:27.817
I see. Are you checking
how your businesses are doing?

09:27.900 --> 09:29.819
-We're just saying hi.
-Goodness.

09:30.820 --> 09:34.574
By the way,
how do you look younger with age?

09:34.657 --> 09:36.158
-I do, right?
-Yes.

09:36.242 --> 09:38.828
Why can't Mi-jo talk sweetly like Joo-hee?

09:38.911 --> 09:42.081
What's wrong? Does she still
make jokes about being adopted?

09:42.164 --> 09:43.874
Only when she's cornered.

09:43.958 --> 09:46.085
That's so cheap, isn't it?

09:46.168 --> 09:47.962
Then undo the adoption.

09:48.045 --> 09:50.047
She's already 39. It's a bit too late.

09:52.675 --> 09:54.969
I'm leaving first.
I hope you guys become prettier.

09:55.052 --> 09:56.554
-Okay.
-Goodbye.

09:59.307 --> 10:01.350
I mean, I'm already pretty enough.

10:13.571 --> 10:16.324
Don't you think Mi-jo has
such a wonderful family?

10:16.407 --> 10:17.366
She does.

10:18.242 --> 10:20.036
No wonder she grew up well.

10:21.495 --> 10:23.497
You tend to blurt out
sincere words at times.

10:24.040 --> 10:25.833
You better not tell her.

10:25.916 --> 10:27.209
You'll only spoil her.

10:30.296 --> 10:32.965
I'm so nervous. Oh, dear.

10:33.049 --> 10:34.842
-Okay. Relax.
-Be gentle.

10:34.925 --> 10:36.677
Give her a good amount.

10:36.761 --> 10:38.262
Make her beautiful.

10:38.346 --> 10:40.056
This feels so weird.

10:40.139 --> 10:41.307
Done?

10:42.475 --> 10:45.478
Hold this to your nose,
but don't add pressure.

10:45.561 --> 10:46.520
Okay.

10:46.604 --> 10:50.691
Hey, do you have
any plastic surgeon friends?

10:51.317 --> 10:54.737
It'll cost a fortune for you.
Don't even dream about it.

10:55.655 --> 10:58.574
That hurt my pride. Hey, I'm perfect.

10:59.200 --> 11:00.493
I meant for Joo-hee.

11:01.118 --> 11:04.080
I thought she could get her eyes done.

11:04.163 --> 11:05.456
Do I have small eyes?

11:05.539 --> 11:07.083
You're just fine.

11:07.166 --> 11:09.210
Don't let her nonsense get to you.

11:09.293 --> 11:10.628
Nonsense?

11:10.711 --> 11:12.838
-It was just a piece of advice.
-Gosh.

11:12.922 --> 11:13.964
Hey.

11:14.048 --> 11:16.217
-Where's the director?
-Can I help you?

11:16.300 --> 11:17.635
-Can I help you?
-Where is she?

11:17.718 --> 11:19.345
-What's going on?
-I have no business with you.

11:19.428 --> 11:20.888
-Call her.
-Did you borrow money?

11:20.971 --> 11:24.058
-Was there a medical accident?
-I want to see her right now!

11:24.141 --> 11:26.060
-One minute, ma'am.
-Where is she?

11:26.143 --> 11:27.978
-Talk to us first.
-Call her over.

11:28.062 --> 11:29.438
-There.
-Now.

11:29.522 --> 11:31.607
-Ma'am--
-What's going on?

11:31.690 --> 11:33.859
-Dr. Cha.
-Is it you?

11:33.943 --> 11:34.985
Are you the director?

11:35.069 --> 11:35.986
Who are you?

11:36.570 --> 11:40.574
Me? I'm the wife of Mr. Jeong,
the man you seduced, you wench.

11:40.658 --> 11:43.494
Hey, what's going on?

11:43.577 --> 11:45.704
Hold on. Who's Mr. Jeong?

11:45.788 --> 11:48.707
I knew you'd play dumb.

11:48.791 --> 11:52.002
Hey. We already know it's you,
so you better beg.

11:52.086 --> 11:53.129
Go on.

11:53.796 --> 11:57.174
Who are you to barge
into my clinic and cause a scene?

11:57.258 --> 11:58.342
Scene?

11:59.385 --> 12:01.512
How could you say that after what you did?

12:01.595 --> 12:04.265
You seduced a father of two.

12:04.348 --> 12:06.308
I know he paid for this clinic!

12:07.143 --> 12:07.977
What?

12:08.602 --> 12:09.979
Have you gone insane?

12:10.062 --> 12:11.564
I just can't be nice, can I?

12:12.148 --> 12:13.357
Ma'am!

12:15.317 --> 12:16.610
You bitch!

12:17.111 --> 12:18.112
You bitch!

12:23.325 --> 12:24.160
<i>Ma'am!</i>

12:26.370 --> 12:28.372
<i>-Ma'am!
-Hey! Come here!</i>

12:29.457 --> 12:31.375
<i>-Hey! Come here!
-Stop it!</i>

12:31.459 --> 12:33.252
<i>Stop it!</i>

12:33.335 --> 12:35.337
<i>-Hey!
-Damn it!</i>

12:35.421 --> 12:37.131
<i>-Hold on!
-Hey!</i>

12:37.214 --> 12:39.633
<i>-How dare you?
-Ma'am!</i>

12:39.717 --> 12:42.595
<i>-Get up! I said, get up!
-Sorry! I'm sorry!</i>

12:42.678 --> 12:45.347
<i>-Come here!
-Please don't do this!</i>

12:45.431 --> 12:47.766
<i>-Was it you? Was it?
-No!</i>

12:47.850 --> 12:51.145
<i>-How brazen of you.
-Stop it!</i>

12:51.228 --> 12:52.813
<i>Ma'am!</i>

12:52.897 --> 12:55.524
<i>-How dare you?
-Ma'am!</i>

12:55.608 --> 12:58.611
<i>-Get up! I said, get up!
-Stop it!</i>

12:58.694 --> 13:00.738
GANGNAM POLICE STATION

13:00.821 --> 13:01.864
Why did you hit them?

13:02.531 --> 13:04.533
-Well, I wasn't going
-Mistake.

13:04.617 --> 13:06.035
-to hit them.
-A mistake.

13:06.118 --> 13:08.037
-It was a misunderstanding.
-It's swollen.

13:08.579 --> 13:10.456
Is this because of the fillers?

13:11.582 --> 13:13.083
No, it's because you got hit.

13:13.626 --> 13:15.461
Hey, you should sue them.

13:16.504 --> 13:18.297
It was a misunderstanding,

13:18.380 --> 13:19.924
so why bother?

13:20.007 --> 13:21.175
You shouldn't.

13:21.258 --> 13:23.761
You once had the wrong idea
and tried to beat me up too.

13:24.887 --> 13:26.472
What are you talking about?

13:26.555 --> 13:28.015
What? Did you forget already?

13:28.849 --> 13:31.310
How could you forget?

13:31.393 --> 13:32.478
Right.

13:33.812 --> 13:35.439
You did the same thing before.

13:35.523 --> 13:36.732
Right.

13:38.442 --> 13:40.694
That was ages ago.

13:41.779 --> 13:44.198
Why would you suddenly bring that up?

13:45.616 --> 13:49.161
YEAR 2000

13:51.330 --> 13:55.209
CHA MI-JO

14:31.161 --> 14:32.204
Excuse me.

14:32.788 --> 14:33.998
Did you lose something?

14:38.836 --> 14:39.753
My wallet.

14:44.550 --> 14:45.384
Here.

14:46.802 --> 14:47.970
You have no money.

14:52.182 --> 14:53.392
I'll pay you back.

14:54.184 --> 14:55.853
But why are you talking casually?

14:55.936 --> 14:57.938
Your name tag. You're in 11th grade.

14:58.522 --> 14:59.440
Are you older?

14:59.523 --> 15:01.108
No. I'm also in 11th grade.

15:01.191 --> 15:02.151
I see.

15:02.860 --> 15:04.278
-I'll pay you back.
-It's fine.

15:05.070 --> 15:06.697
I'll just think I helped the needy.

15:07.364 --> 15:08.365
Bye.

15:11.577 --> 15:13.579
Hey! Are you a lunatic?

15:13.662 --> 15:14.955
I'm not in need.

15:15.039 --> 15:16.999
I didn't say you were in need.

15:17.082 --> 15:19.418
But you said you'll think that. Why?

15:19.501 --> 15:21.462
Do I look pitiful? Unfortunate?

15:21.545 --> 15:23.714
Gosh, what a crazy…

15:23.797 --> 15:26.425
Hey, get lost. Just go.

15:40.230 --> 15:41.273
What's her deal?

15:44.860 --> 15:46.570
SILOAM SNACK BAR

15:57.706 --> 15:58.624
Are you sure?

15:59.333 --> 16:00.459
Is it her?

16:00.542 --> 16:02.252
Be quiet. She'll hear you.

16:11.053 --> 16:13.722
-Mom.
-Hey, you're back from school.

16:13.806 --> 16:16.183
You should've just
gone straight to the academy.

16:16.266 --> 16:17.685
I came to wash the dishes.

16:17.768 --> 16:20.980
Your dad said he'd arrive soon.
You can go study.

16:21.063 --> 16:23.232
No, I have some free time.
Let me help a bit.

16:23.315 --> 16:25.109
Goodness. It's really fine.

16:25.192 --> 16:26.860
I know you're tired.

16:35.327 --> 16:39.498
Why… Why are you doing this?

16:41.500 --> 16:44.545
Is the owner of that snack bar your mom?

16:45.129 --> 16:47.172
Yes, she is.

16:47.256 --> 16:48.298
What grade are you in?

16:48.924 --> 16:49.758
Eleventh grade.

16:50.426 --> 16:52.594
What? Then are you guys twins?

16:52.678 --> 16:53.804
Sorry?

16:53.887 --> 16:57.725
No way. Then she kept one
and gave the other up for adoption?

16:57.808 --> 16:59.810
I'll rip your mouth if you don't shut up.

17:01.478 --> 17:03.981
Both of you are in 11th grade
and have the same mom.

17:04.064 --> 17:05.315
I'm right.

17:05.899 --> 17:10.487
What's going on? What is this all about?

17:10.571 --> 17:12.698
Don't be so scared. We're the same age.

17:13.198 --> 17:14.742
Siloam Snack Bar.

17:14.825 --> 17:17.202
This is the only Siloam Snack Bar
in Gocheok-dong.

17:17.286 --> 17:20.039
Yes. There's just one.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.667
Is she really your birth mom?
Not your stepmom?

17:23.751 --> 17:25.169
Yes, she is.

17:25.252 --> 17:29.339
I have photos of me and my parents
from back when I was born.

17:30.090 --> 17:32.634
What is this? A soap opera?

17:39.933 --> 17:42.686
Where do you live? Is it far from here?

17:42.770 --> 17:43.979
I'm from Samseong-dong.

17:44.980 --> 17:46.940
Your adoptive parents must be rich.

17:47.941 --> 17:51.528
They say the owner of Siloam Snack Bar
in Gocheok-dong is your mom?

17:53.739 --> 17:55.824
Then that should be me.

17:56.909 --> 17:58.202
I'm sorry.

18:01.830 --> 18:05.334
She visited her orphanage
and saw her files.

18:05.918 --> 18:09.546
She saw your shop's name,
and that's why she thought it was you.

18:10.506 --> 18:12.049
Do you live in an orphanage?

18:12.132 --> 18:14.635
No, I visited. She just explained.

18:14.718 --> 18:17.262
I see. Are you guys friends?

18:17.346 --> 18:18.722
-No.
-I'm her creditor.

18:18.806 --> 18:20.140
Her creditor?

18:20.224 --> 18:21.391
You better pay me back.

18:21.475 --> 18:22.810
I will when my dad gets here.

18:36.698 --> 18:37.658
Mi-jo.

18:39.243 --> 18:41.495
Mom. I'm sorry.

18:45.666 --> 18:47.501
You should've told me.

18:50.337 --> 18:52.422
I would've helped you
find your birth parents.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.093
Thank you.

18:56.176 --> 19:00.764
Our daughter would've waited
out on the street if it weren't for you.

19:01.431 --> 19:02.558
Thank you so much.

19:02.641 --> 19:03.976
Don't worry about it.

19:10.315 --> 19:12.609
Who beat up my sister?

19:13.569 --> 19:14.653
Why is Mi-hyeon here?

19:14.736 --> 19:15.904
Darn it.

19:15.988 --> 19:19.700
Well, I was a bit worried,
so I called her.

19:19.783 --> 19:21.118
-Hey!
-I…

19:21.201 --> 19:23.412
-Gosh.
-I was just…

19:29.293 --> 19:30.752
What's with her outfit?

19:34.214 --> 19:36.258
Left. Right. Chin.

19:36.884 --> 19:39.094
Your face is fine. Where did you get hit?

19:39.178 --> 19:40.637
What are you wearing?

19:40.721 --> 19:43.056
Who the hell did this?

19:43.140 --> 19:44.808
Fess up while I'm still being nice.

19:45.392 --> 19:46.560
Goodness.

19:46.643 --> 19:49.646
I'm so sorry.
Her clinic has the same name, so--

19:49.730 --> 19:51.940
Are you the one who beat up my sister?

19:52.024 --> 19:55.402
You must be her older sister.
There was a slight misunderstanding.

19:55.485 --> 19:56.361
I'm terribly sorry.

19:56.445 --> 19:58.280
You're right.

19:58.363 --> 19:59.865
You better be.

19:59.948 --> 20:01.742
-Goodness!
-Mi-hyeon.

20:01.825 --> 20:03.702
-Come on.
-Goodness.

20:04.328 --> 20:06.830
You should've done your research properly

20:06.914 --> 20:08.582
before barging in like that.

20:08.665 --> 20:10.042
Goodness. You're right.

20:10.125 --> 20:13.587
I was so furious. I must've lost my mind.

20:13.670 --> 20:15.380
Gosh. I'm so sorry.

20:15.464 --> 20:16.757
-You're sorry?
-Goodness!

20:16.840 --> 20:19.176
-Mi-hyeon, please.
-As an apology,

20:19.259 --> 20:21.470
how about we bring
our friends to your clinic?

20:21.553 --> 20:24.139
Our online and offline friends
all get Botox these days.

20:24.223 --> 20:25.390
Okay. Thank you.

20:25.474 --> 20:27.059
"Thank you"? Are you serious?

20:27.142 --> 20:29.728
We'll compensate for all damages.

20:29.811 --> 20:33.607
-Definitely.
-Goodness! I'm so sorry.

20:33.690 --> 20:34.858
It's understandable.

20:34.942 --> 20:38.278
Your husband cheated on you.
Of course you'd see red.

20:38.362 --> 20:40.155
Goodness, you're so understanding.

20:40.239 --> 20:44.076
I believe adultery
should be illegal once again.

20:44.159 --> 20:45.285
It's a crime.

20:45.369 --> 20:48.038
Goodness. You're making me feel worse.

20:48.121 --> 20:50.123
I hope you find that bitch.

20:50.999 --> 20:52.125
Hey.

20:52.751 --> 20:54.628
She beat us up, you know?

20:55.671 --> 20:57.214
I'll take it from here.

20:57.297 --> 20:58.215
Come.

20:59.132 --> 21:01.134
-Gosh.
-Goodness.

21:01.218 --> 21:02.052
Goodness.

21:06.515 --> 21:08.225
This could happen to you too.

21:11.395 --> 21:13.939
That thought crossed my mind too.

21:14.022 --> 21:15.774
When I was getting beaten up,

21:15.857 --> 21:17.609
I thought of you.

21:18.277 --> 21:20.696
Hey. You make it sound like

21:21.238 --> 21:23.824
I'm a mistress or something.

21:23.907 --> 21:25.450
Are you guys serious?

21:28.287 --> 21:29.913
And there's your man.

21:30.914 --> 21:31.999
Shut it.

21:32.082 --> 21:33.458
Hello, Jin-seok.

21:37.337 --> 21:39.172
Did you bring your car?

21:43.844 --> 21:45.887
Aren't you guys turning 40 soon?

21:46.888 --> 21:49.725
Who in the world said
you become wiser when you turn 40?

21:49.808 --> 21:51.059
Was it Mencius?

21:51.143 --> 21:52.060
It was Confucius.

21:52.144 --> 21:53.812
Just shut it.

21:53.895 --> 21:55.439
Get up. How did you get here?

21:55.522 --> 21:57.524
-In a police car.
-Good going.

21:58.734 --> 22:02.988
Then should we let the man who's having
an affair with Chan-young give us a ride?

22:03.071 --> 22:05.699
Let's just punch her
and compensate her for it.

22:07.159 --> 22:10.412
I don't know how else to describe him.
You know I'm not good with words.

22:12.080 --> 22:14.207
-That hurts.
-Get up this instant.

22:17.002 --> 22:18.754
You should be ashamed of yourselves.

22:23.258 --> 22:24.468
Gosh, what's that?

22:26.636 --> 22:27.763
What the…

22:28.805 --> 22:29.765
What's she wearing?

22:31.016 --> 22:32.017
What's wrong with her?

22:33.351 --> 22:35.312
This evening is full of surprises.

22:35.395 --> 22:36.229
Let's go.

22:36.313 --> 22:37.981
Take your sister's car.

22:38.065 --> 22:39.858
I don't want to ride with you.

22:39.941 --> 22:42.360
A true friend lets you know
what's right or wrong.

22:42.944 --> 22:45.113
Bye. Don't be late tomorrow.

22:45.197 --> 22:46.073
I'm not going.

22:46.156 --> 22:49.367
Do we have to go there
on our precious day off?

22:49.451 --> 22:50.494
Where are you going?

22:51.995 --> 22:54.539
My sister wants to settle this.

22:54.623 --> 22:56.374
But she could still sue you.

22:56.458 --> 23:00.337
If you don't tell us the truth,
we won't let this slide.

23:00.420 --> 23:01.797
I'll take her to the hospital…

23:05.008 --> 23:06.885
Do you do social dancing or something?

23:08.428 --> 23:10.388
You're so ignorant.

23:10.472 --> 23:11.640
It's dancesport.

23:12.641 --> 23:14.351
What kind of outfit is that?

23:14.935 --> 23:17.395
Then why do figure skaters
dress like that?

23:18.522 --> 23:19.481
Do Mom and Dad know?

23:22.067 --> 23:23.819
You're a traitor if you tell them.

23:24.486 --> 23:28.115
If you're ashamed of your hobby,
then there's something wrong with it.

23:28.198 --> 23:30.075
Imagine if Dad saw me in this.

23:30.158 --> 23:32.577
Then you'd become
a bald woman in her mid-forties.

23:32.661 --> 23:34.204
If you know that, don't tell them.

23:35.205 --> 23:38.250
I was going to show off
this outfit today, but I couldn't.

23:38.333 --> 23:40.127
I ended up wearing it to a police station!

23:41.545 --> 23:43.213
I'm so embarrassed by you.

23:46.758 --> 23:48.009
<i>The swelling has gone down.</i>

23:48.927 --> 23:50.303
Are you hurt anywhere else?

23:50.846 --> 23:51.847
Jin-seok.

23:52.722 --> 23:54.724
Let's call Mi-jo over
and pull out her hair.

23:56.560 --> 23:58.645
She keeps saying
that we're having an affair.

24:03.024 --> 24:06.069
That's because she finds it fun
to see you all worked up.

24:08.488 --> 24:09.698
Did she say anything else?

24:10.615 --> 24:11.867
No. Why?

24:14.119 --> 24:16.705
I told her I wouldn't stand still
if she bothered you.

24:33.847 --> 24:34.848
What is it?

24:38.643 --> 24:39.686
Jin-seok.

24:39.769 --> 24:40.687
Yes?

24:42.731 --> 24:43.899
Can't you get a divorce?

24:49.905 --> 24:51.364
It's getting late.

24:51.448 --> 24:54.075
Let's go. I'll drop you off. Come on.

24:55.493 --> 24:56.912
I still have work to do.

24:58.121 --> 24:59.122
You can go first.

25:02.542 --> 25:04.961
You can't work in that state.

25:05.045 --> 25:07.005
Just go home. I'll drop you off.

25:07.839 --> 25:09.466
Had I followed you

25:10.425 --> 25:12.469
when you went abroad to study,

25:14.387 --> 25:16.181
would we be married right now?

25:26.316 --> 25:27.859
How about a movie this weekend?

25:32.405 --> 25:35.075
This is exactly why
she says we're having an affair.

25:36.201 --> 25:38.286
It's obvious that you love me,

25:39.496 --> 25:41.456
but we only eat and watch movies.

25:48.838 --> 25:50.590
This is exhausting for me.

26:12.696 --> 26:15.156
Fine.

26:16.950 --> 26:18.159
You get sullen so easily.

26:19.160 --> 26:21.746
Fine. I won't say those things
ever again. I'm sorry.

26:24.416 --> 26:25.417
Okay?

26:27.168 --> 26:29.379
Let's meet this weekend.

26:32.215 --> 26:33.216
I'm so happy.

26:56.364 --> 26:57.365
What is that?

26:58.616 --> 26:59.993
It's a dating app.

27:01.494 --> 27:02.912
Has it ever worked out?

27:04.414 --> 27:06.875
I did have lunch with a guy last week.

27:08.710 --> 27:09.794
How was he?

27:11.463 --> 27:12.714
He was okay.

27:13.340 --> 27:16.009
You should never go
on blind dates in the afternoon.

27:16.092 --> 27:17.761
What was that? Is that a ghost?

27:19.596 --> 27:22.182
You should meet in the evening,
have a light meal,

27:22.265 --> 27:25.226
drink a lot of alcohol,
and sleep together right after.

27:25.310 --> 27:28.563
Goodness. You're all talk.

27:28.646 --> 27:30.607
You're not a teenage girl anymore.

27:30.690 --> 27:32.984
Be honest with yourself.
Don't you agree, Mi-jo?

27:33.068 --> 27:36.363
Scold Chan-young, will you?
What's wrong with her?

27:36.446 --> 27:39.240
She may be crude,

27:39.324 --> 27:41.368
but she has a point.

27:42.494 --> 27:44.579
I just can't get through to you guys.

27:44.662 --> 27:47.332
Gosh. Your minds are in the gutter.

27:52.170 --> 27:54.589
<i>Seriously! You guys are nasty.</i>

28:15.068 --> 28:16.945
-Me too!
-Me too, please!

28:23.827 --> 28:25.495
This way. This way, please!

28:34.295 --> 28:35.296
Did you sleep well?

28:38.425 --> 28:40.677
Mi-jo is always so happy here.

28:40.760 --> 28:42.470
This place is like her hometown.

29:08.163 --> 29:08.997
Ma'am.

29:09.873 --> 29:12.459
Ma'am, could you please…

29:21.134 --> 29:23.052
You can do it.

29:27.307 --> 29:28.600
Do you not like mushrooms?

29:28.683 --> 29:29.559
No?

29:31.478 --> 29:32.312
Have some mushrooms.

29:32.395 --> 29:33.730
-Do you want more meat?
-Yes.

29:33.813 --> 29:35.982
-You don't like mushrooms?
-Enjoy.

29:36.065 --> 29:37.817
-Gosh, it looks good.
-Enjoy.

29:37.901 --> 29:38.943
-Thank you.
-Sure.

29:39.027 --> 29:40.111
All right.

29:42.489 --> 29:43.907
Why aren't you eating?

29:43.990 --> 29:45.200
I did.

29:45.283 --> 29:47.410
You should eat more. Okay?

29:47.494 --> 29:50.038
I'll grill you some delicious meat,
so eat some more. Okay?

29:51.039 --> 29:52.499
-Sausages.
-Have this.

29:52.582 --> 29:54.584
-Do you want some sausages?
-Thank you.

29:54.667 --> 29:55.794
Here.

29:57.587 --> 29:58.797
-Here.
-Thank you.

29:59.631 --> 30:00.673
Who is that?

30:06.137 --> 30:08.056
What a handsome stranger.

30:08.890 --> 30:09.974
Who is he?

30:17.065 --> 30:18.900
-Hey, guys.
-Mr. Kim!

30:18.983 --> 30:20.527
-How have you been?
-Mr. Kim!

30:20.610 --> 30:24.239
Goodness. What were you up to? Let's go.

30:24.322 --> 30:25.532
Oh, dear.

30:26.199 --> 30:29.035
-I forgot about our English class.
-I see.

30:29.118 --> 30:31.329
He must be their English teacher.

30:31.412 --> 30:34.040
I totally forgot.
You're starting today, right?

30:34.123 --> 30:34.958
Yes.

30:35.041 --> 30:37.669
Then should we have the class right now?

30:38.503 --> 30:40.713
I don't think now is a good time.

30:41.506 --> 30:42.382
You're right.

30:43.508 --> 30:45.635
Oh, you should say hi.

30:45.718 --> 30:48.054
Everyone who loves
Onnuri Child Care Center is here.

30:48.137 --> 30:49.722
Hello.

30:51.266 --> 30:53.226
-Hello.
-Hello.

30:56.479 --> 30:57.313
Did you eat?

30:57.397 --> 30:59.107
-No.
-Have some meat.

30:59.190 --> 31:01.734
This is a rare occasion, so eat up. Okay?

31:05.029 --> 31:07.115
Let me. I'm pretty good at grilling meat.

31:07.198 --> 31:09.284
I am as well.
You can be a guest for today.

31:15.081 --> 31:18.418
-Guys, how have you been?
-You should've let him help you.

31:18.501 --> 31:21.170
Did you have to shut him down like that?

31:21.254 --> 31:22.714
Just bring me a plate.

31:22.797 --> 31:24.757
Here you go.

31:24.841 --> 31:26.968
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

31:28.261 --> 31:29.262
All right.

31:30.722 --> 31:32.223
Did you have some? Try it.

31:32.307 --> 31:33.182
Thank you.

31:34.601 --> 31:36.144
-Is it good?
-Is it good?

31:36.227 --> 31:37.520
-Eat up.
-Okay.

31:47.655 --> 31:49.407
Over here!

31:49.490 --> 31:51.159
He looks like a bachelor, right?

31:52.327 --> 31:54.746
But he's too handsome to be single.

31:54.829 --> 31:57.332
Go! Shoot!

31:58.833 --> 32:00.335
Is he here to adopt?

32:00.418 --> 32:03.963
Gosh. He's their English teacher.
Are you stupid?

32:07.091 --> 32:10.303
Bring me some hot water.
This is still too oily.

32:15.308 --> 32:16.434
Is that how you say it?

32:20.772 --> 32:23.358
You're so pathetic.

32:25.151 --> 32:27.320
Dried pollack and beer on our way home?

32:27.820 --> 32:29.447
We haven't gone there in ages.

32:29.530 --> 32:31.282
Exactly.

32:31.366 --> 32:33.034
Dried pollack!

32:33.117 --> 32:34.369
Let's hurry!

32:50.176 --> 32:51.970
Ji-hyeon got adopted.

32:52.053 --> 32:53.805
Yes. I heard.

32:54.472 --> 32:56.224
You must be sad, Hoon.

32:56.724 --> 32:57.850
You liked each other.

32:57.934 --> 33:00.103
We opened a social media account…

33:01.854 --> 33:04.065
that only she and I can see.

33:04.732 --> 33:05.650
I see.

33:06.693 --> 33:09.320
I bet you guys will break up in a year.

33:09.404 --> 33:10.905
You always say that.

33:15.076 --> 33:17.245
Do you want to get adopted too?

33:19.122 --> 33:20.164
Not really.

33:20.748 --> 33:22.291
It's not that bad.

33:22.875 --> 33:26.629
You know, I was adopted around your age.

33:26.713 --> 33:30.174
And having a new set of parents

33:30.258 --> 33:31.843
isn't actually that bad.

33:33.845 --> 33:37.432
Do you want me to get adopted?

33:39.642 --> 33:42.645
If I stay here, I get to see you often.

33:43.563 --> 33:44.939
This isn't bad either.

33:51.612 --> 33:52.488
Hoon.

33:53.990 --> 33:55.658
I…

33:58.995 --> 34:00.747
I won't be visiting for about a year.

34:01.456 --> 34:03.207
I need to go somewhere.

34:03.791 --> 34:04.709
Will you be back?

34:05.835 --> 34:06.669
What?

34:06.753 --> 34:09.338
Are you coming back after a year?

34:10.590 --> 34:14.010
Of course! I'm definitely coming back.

34:15.178 --> 34:17.597
Then we should also make
a social media account.

34:18.931 --> 34:20.266
But I don't do social media.

34:20.892 --> 34:22.602
You can start now.

34:23.186 --> 34:25.146
Should I? Okay, let's do that.

34:26.439 --> 34:28.733
I'll come again before I leave. Okay?

34:29.400 --> 34:31.444
The English teacher is single.

34:35.782 --> 34:37.909
Thanks for that information.

34:44.165 --> 34:47.085
I'll come by once more before I fly out.

34:47.168 --> 34:49.754
If you're too busy, just give us a call.

34:49.837 --> 34:50.963
It's a long drive.

34:51.047 --> 34:54.175
Okay. Bye, kids. I'll come back.

34:54.258 --> 34:56.302
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

34:56.385 --> 34:57.845
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

34:57.929 --> 34:59.097
-Get home safely.
-Okay.

34:59.180 --> 35:00.765
Drive safe.

35:05.728 --> 35:07.021
Stop looking for him.

35:07.105 --> 35:08.898
-Let's go.
-Okay.

35:18.908 --> 35:21.410
One of the lights
in the boys' room doesn't work.

35:21.494 --> 35:23.663
I replaced the bulb,
but it's still not working.

35:23.746 --> 35:24.956
I'll take a look.

35:25.039 --> 35:26.582
You're good at everything.

35:31.379 --> 35:33.422
Has the assemblyman contacted you yet?

35:35.591 --> 35:37.093
Do you still call him that?

35:38.177 --> 35:39.887
He'll call once his anger subsides.

35:42.598 --> 35:43.724
How's So-won?

35:44.308 --> 35:45.810
She says she's doing well,

35:45.893 --> 35:47.979
but she never sees me
and makes me curious.

35:48.062 --> 35:51.399
That's how younger sisters are.
They can't be bothered.

35:51.482 --> 35:52.316
Is that so?

35:52.400 --> 35:53.818
Ma'am.

35:53.901 --> 35:55.069
What is it, Hoon?

35:55.153 --> 35:56.154
Here.

35:58.030 --> 36:00.366
Goodness, it's a watch. Whose is it?

36:00.449 --> 36:01.993
I found it by the sink.

36:02.577 --> 36:04.120
They must've left it behind.

36:09.417 --> 36:12.170
Hey, you guys left a watch here.

36:12.253 --> 36:13.129
Whose is it?

36:14.422 --> 36:15.423
I knew it was yours.

36:16.507 --> 36:17.925
Parcel delivery?

36:18.759 --> 36:21.262
Hold on.
Are you going back to Seoul today?

36:21.345 --> 36:22.597
I am.

36:22.680 --> 36:24.140
Deliver it for me then, okay?

36:25.474 --> 36:28.102
Just wait. I'll send it over.

36:28.186 --> 36:29.187
Okay.

36:30.062 --> 36:31.731
BIG DRIED POLLACK
TASTY DRAFT BEER!

36:36.485 --> 36:38.112
I guess it's being replaced.

36:38.196 --> 36:40.072
I can't believe the owner.

36:40.156 --> 36:42.867
After all the dried pollack we've had?

36:42.950 --> 36:45.161
How did you not know?
You live around here.

36:45.244 --> 36:48.331
This just shows that
we haven't been drinking much lately.

36:58.925 --> 37:00.218
I have something to say.

37:01.844 --> 37:04.013
I'll be living in Palm Springs for a year.

37:08.059 --> 37:09.936
Where is that?

37:10.019 --> 37:11.020
In the US.

37:13.439 --> 37:14.357
Why?

37:16.025 --> 37:17.276
I'm taking my sabbatical.

37:17.902 --> 37:20.029
I'm going to take a break for a year.

37:22.615 --> 37:23.616
Does that mean

37:24.242 --> 37:26.244
we won't be seeing you for a year?

37:27.745 --> 37:30.289
Aren't you excited
that we'll finally be apart?

37:32.208 --> 37:33.251
Whatever.

37:33.876 --> 37:36.295
At least you won't be
nagging me for a year.

37:36.379 --> 37:39.006
I'm going to video call you every day.
You better pick up.

37:39.507 --> 37:41.717
You should take a break
from nagging as well.

37:42.468 --> 37:43.886
If you're sick of my nagging,

37:44.470 --> 37:46.138
end it with Jin-seok.

37:46.222 --> 37:47.890
How many years has it been?

37:49.308 --> 37:50.935
What's it to you?

37:54.939 --> 37:57.525
Do you know
what I regret the most in life?

37:58.901 --> 38:01.028
Calling him over when you were there.

38:02.613 --> 38:04.156
It was the worst day.

38:04.240 --> 38:07.618
Come on. That's enough, you guys. Drink.

38:12.623 --> 38:13.958
Yes.

38:14.041 --> 38:15.126
That's the place.

38:15.626 --> 38:16.460
Okay.

38:18.921 --> 38:20.298
Are you expecting someone?

38:20.381 --> 38:22.758
Yes. A friend of mine is going to stop by.

38:22.842 --> 38:24.635
He needs to give me something.

38:24.719 --> 38:26.637
It's a guy? Is he single?

38:28.514 --> 38:31.017
He loves clubbing,
so don't get your hopes up.

38:31.100 --> 38:33.019
I know him from my school reunion.

38:33.102 --> 38:35.646
Those Cheongdam-dong snobs?

38:37.481 --> 38:39.650
-Right.
-That makes you a snob too.

38:40.609 --> 38:42.486
You're from the same reunion.

38:42.570 --> 38:44.947
That's why I don't attend anymore.

38:45.448 --> 38:47.325
I convinced my mom.

38:52.330 --> 38:53.164
Over here.

38:53.247 --> 38:54.248
Hey.

38:57.293 --> 39:00.504
You could've bought a new one.
Did you have to call me over here?

39:01.213 --> 39:03.799
I've had this for a while.
You didn't scratch it, did you?

39:03.883 --> 39:05.676
No, I didn't even open it.

39:06.927 --> 39:08.512
Thanks. You can go now.

39:16.437 --> 39:17.897
I thought you were in a hurry.

39:19.774 --> 39:21.984
This place serves delicious pork ribs.

39:22.777 --> 39:23.778
Right?

39:24.403 --> 39:26.822
Sorry? Yes.

39:30.993 --> 39:33.371
There's nothing you can do
if we're destined to meet.

39:34.663 --> 39:36.123
Destined, my foot.

39:36.707 --> 39:39.752
How could you say that
when he's happily married?

39:39.835 --> 39:41.128
When are you flying out?

39:41.879 --> 39:43.255
You should just go tomorrow.

39:44.006 --> 39:46.050
I feel lighthearted overall,

39:46.717 --> 39:48.844
but you and Jin-seok make me feel uneasy.

39:48.928 --> 39:50.513
Are you going to keep this up?

39:51.555 --> 39:53.015
It's an affair.

39:53.682 --> 39:54.892
It's not love.

39:55.935 --> 39:57.061
Hey…

39:57.144 --> 40:00.689
It's none of your business,
so just go to Palm Springs already.

40:00.773 --> 40:04.026
Do you think he'll still date you
when you grow old?

40:04.110 --> 40:06.695
Live your life while you still can.

40:06.779 --> 40:08.572
It's my fucking life!

40:16.747 --> 40:17.748
She's mad.

40:21.794 --> 40:23.254
She's really mad.

40:44.358 --> 40:45.443
Are you mad?

40:46.610 --> 40:48.028
What do you think, you brat?

40:51.031 --> 40:52.324
I'm sorry.

40:55.494 --> 40:57.663
You're just too good for him.

40:58.205 --> 40:59.415
I'm not.

40:59.999 --> 41:02.084
I've never had a shining moment in life.

41:02.626 --> 41:05.629
You were blinding
when you auditioned to become an actress.

41:07.339 --> 41:08.674
And look where that got me.

41:12.720 --> 41:14.096
You know…

41:15.055 --> 41:17.933
I'm so mad at him
because he's the reason why

41:18.017 --> 41:19.310
you couldn't make it.

41:19.393 --> 41:21.604
You could've succeeded
if it wasn't for him.

41:22.688 --> 41:23.856
They're all excuses.

41:28.152 --> 41:28.986
Mi-jo.

41:32.031 --> 41:32.948
I came first.

41:35.159 --> 41:36.911
I met him before she did.

41:36.994 --> 41:40.414
So this isn't an affair.

41:41.624 --> 41:42.708
Are you…

41:43.542 --> 41:45.211
Hey, Chan-young.

41:45.294 --> 41:46.545
I haven't slept with him.

41:49.340 --> 41:51.592
We've never slept together
since he got married.

41:52.384 --> 41:53.802
So stop saying it's an affair.

41:56.305 --> 41:57.723
This is so humiliating.

41:58.766 --> 42:00.309
I didn't want to tell you that.

42:01.644 --> 42:02.728
Hey.

42:04.772 --> 42:06.440
You're driving me crazy. Hey.

42:07.233 --> 42:10.194
Then why haven't you gotten over him yet?

42:10.277 --> 42:13.948
What makes him so great that
you're sacrificing your thirties for him?

42:14.031 --> 42:15.699
I'm mad at myself too.

42:17.243 --> 42:19.787
I hate myself for being this way.

42:21.413 --> 42:22.957
So stop nagging.

42:23.666 --> 42:25.709
I'm going to kill that bastard.

42:27.962 --> 42:31.131
What did he do?
Should he have left that pregnant girl?

42:31.715 --> 42:34.218
So why did you break up?
You should've gone abroad too.

42:36.971 --> 42:39.682
Are you rubbing salt
in the wound? Are you?

42:40.391 --> 42:41.767
Does that make it better?

42:44.144 --> 42:45.354
I don't know, you brat.

42:51.318 --> 42:52.611
I know how you feel.

42:53.904 --> 42:55.072
Just give me some time.

42:57.241 --> 42:58.325
I'm going to quit.

42:58.867 --> 43:00.953
Both smoking and Jin-seok.

43:08.294 --> 43:10.337
So you better not video call me.

43:11.463 --> 43:13.549
I'm going to set up cameras in your house.

43:14.258 --> 43:16.635
You're so obsessive.

43:16.719 --> 43:18.137
Do you like me that much?

43:21.265 --> 43:22.558
Come with me.

43:23.475 --> 43:25.894
Dump him and play golf with me. Okay?

43:25.978 --> 43:28.022
You should quit golf.

43:28.105 --> 43:29.815
Gosh, you're being disgusting.

43:29.898 --> 43:32.026
Hey, I'll pay for everything.

43:32.109 --> 43:33.444
Just pay for the meals.

43:33.527 --> 43:34.528
Forget it.

43:39.742 --> 43:40.743
Who is this?

43:56.091 --> 43:58.260
What is it?

43:59.428 --> 44:01.555
What choice do I have?

44:01.639 --> 44:05.142
He's coming all the way here
to give me my watch.

44:05.976 --> 44:08.812
Will you wait for me at my place then?
I bought some wine.

44:08.896 --> 44:10.648
<i>Look at you slurring.</i>

44:10.731 --> 44:14.443
<i>Get your watch, go home,
and sleep, Dr. Cha.</i>

44:14.526 --> 44:17.905
Hey. Let's have just one more drink.

44:19.114 --> 44:22.826
-<i>Joo-hee is totally drunk. And I'm sleepy.</i>
-What do you say?

44:23.786 --> 44:24.828
<i>Get home safe.</i>

44:26.288 --> 44:28.499
Okay. Bye.

45:26.473 --> 45:28.725
-Thank you so much.
-Don't mention it.

45:29.309 --> 45:33.981
I mean, I thought she was
sending me this by courier.

45:34.064 --> 45:36.692
I didn't know
you'd personally deliver it to me.

45:39.945 --> 45:42.322
Thank you so much.

45:51.039 --> 45:52.040
Here.

45:58.881 --> 46:00.048
They're for you.

46:01.383 --> 46:03.093
-For me?
-Yes.

46:03.177 --> 46:05.637
As a thank-you for bringing my watch.

46:06.346 --> 46:09.266
I just stopped by on my way home.

46:10.058 --> 46:11.393
Do you not like flowers?

46:13.228 --> 46:14.229
It's not that.

46:14.855 --> 46:18.692
It's just that I've never received flowers
since graduation.

46:19.985 --> 46:20.861
Thank you.

46:35.042 --> 46:36.001
Do you want to eat?

46:37.753 --> 46:40.422
Eat? At this hour?

46:50.015 --> 46:51.016
But…

46:51.558 --> 46:54.436
why is it my fault
that you couldn't eat the meat?

46:55.187 --> 46:56.188
Well…

46:56.813 --> 46:58.482
I enjoy grilling meat.

46:58.565 --> 47:01.109
But you didn't let me,

47:01.193 --> 47:02.611
so I was a bit sulky.

47:02.694 --> 47:04.029
Oh, that?

47:05.572 --> 47:06.532
I was cold, right?

47:08.575 --> 47:09.535
Have some noodles.

47:09.618 --> 47:13.247
No. I'll definitely gain weight
if I have carbs this late.

47:19.086 --> 47:21.129
I'm sure soju has calories too.

47:21.964 --> 47:23.924
I made a choice.

47:24.007 --> 47:26.134
Since I can't have both,

47:26.218 --> 47:27.261
I picked soju.

47:49.491 --> 47:50.617
By the way,

47:52.244 --> 47:54.913
you travel quite far to teach English.

47:54.997 --> 47:56.248
Are you doing it pro bono?

47:57.499 --> 48:00.460
It's nothing that grand.

48:01.712 --> 48:03.672
That orphanage is special to me.

48:03.755 --> 48:05.090
I see.

48:05.966 --> 48:07.301
Me too.

48:08.302 --> 48:09.344
You see,

48:09.886 --> 48:11.471
it used to be my home.

48:27.821 --> 48:29.323
Do you know what they're called?

48:32.284 --> 48:33.160
No.

48:33.869 --> 48:34.870
Peonies.

48:35.662 --> 48:40.334
They'll be in full bloom by tomorrow.
They have a killer scent.

48:44.421 --> 48:45.881
Your perfume…

48:47.049 --> 48:47.966
has a killer scent too.

48:52.929 --> 48:54.014
I only smell soju.

49:00.771 --> 49:04.650
JINGYEOM NOODLES

49:04.733 --> 49:07.319
Hey, let me drive you home.

49:08.070 --> 49:09.738
There are many cabs around here.

49:09.821 --> 49:10.656
Goodbye.

49:37.349 --> 49:38.183
By the way…

49:41.311 --> 49:42.145
Can I…

49:46.733 --> 49:49.319
Can I have one of them?

49:52.447 --> 49:54.783
I'm not trying to be selfish.

49:54.866 --> 49:57.160
I just haven't seen peonies in a while.

49:57.828 --> 50:00.122
You can take two, so can I have one?

50:03.291 --> 50:04.459
Sure.

50:08.714 --> 50:09.881
Were these really for me?

50:11.633 --> 50:12.467
No.

50:14.553 --> 50:17.305
I'm a terrible liar.

50:18.849 --> 50:20.600
-Do you want one more?
-Gosh, no!

50:20.684 --> 50:22.728
Then I'd look like an awful person.

50:25.021 --> 50:27.149
Thank you for today.

50:27.983 --> 50:29.192
Goodbye.

50:30.193 --> 50:32.112
Let me get you a cab.

50:56.470 --> 50:57.637
What's this place?

51:10.275 --> 51:11.818
Is it a boutique?

51:26.792 --> 51:30.170
Goodness. What's with him?
Why is he coming to me?

51:51.483 --> 51:56.822
PEONY

52:32.566 --> 52:34.568
Gosh, my head.

52:37.070 --> 52:38.822
How much did I drink…

52:44.077 --> 52:44.953
What?

52:51.877 --> 52:56.256
I definitely remember
giving him all three of these last night.

52:56.339 --> 52:57.966
Can I have

52:58.842 --> 52:59.968
one of them?

53:01.678 --> 53:02.804
Sure.

53:07.183 --> 53:08.727
Darn it.

53:18.153 --> 53:21.323
<i>The peonies are so fragrant. Thank you.</i>

53:33.793 --> 53:35.795
<i>I apologize for last night.</i>

53:36.296 --> 53:38.715
<i>I'm sorry and thank you.</i>

53:41.384 --> 53:44.346
<i>Any time. Have a good day.</i>

53:51.478 --> 53:55.774
WATCH

54:19.005 --> 54:20.298
Come in.

54:21.508 --> 54:22.509
Jin-seok.

54:23.093 --> 54:23.969
Hey.

54:24.511 --> 54:25.595
I was nearby.

54:25.679 --> 54:27.305
Really? What were you doing?

54:28.139 --> 54:29.432
Don't ask.

54:29.516 --> 54:31.017
I'm curious. Who were you with?

54:31.101 --> 54:32.477
Don't ask.

54:33.979 --> 54:35.689
Sir, your wife is here.

54:38.024 --> 54:39.859
I thought you'd be here, honey.

54:42.404 --> 54:43.488
Hello.

54:44.155 --> 54:45.490
Hello.

54:45.573 --> 54:47.200
Were you having a meeting?

54:48.118 --> 54:50.954
It's nothing important. I just stopped by.

54:54.457 --> 54:56.960
-I'll get going, Jin-seok.
-Bye.

55:06.302 --> 55:07.262
Did you drive here?

55:07.929 --> 55:10.181
No, a cab. So we could take your car.

55:10.265 --> 55:12.767
Okay. Let me just wrap up quickly.

55:16.062 --> 55:17.647
Next time, call before you come.

55:22.152 --> 55:23.528
Let's go, honey.

57:15.306 --> 57:16.766
A Chinese restaurant?

57:17.892 --> 57:19.394
That's out of the blue.

57:36.578 --> 57:40.874
Are you confident during this recession?
You passed up being the chief chef.

57:40.957 --> 57:42.375
I wanted to open my own place.

57:42.459 --> 57:44.586
I guess you're really
not going back to the US.

57:44.669 --> 57:46.754
Gosh. So-won is still here.

57:47.964 --> 57:50.508
It must be uncomfortable
to have such a caring brother.

57:51.050 --> 57:52.051
Do you think so?

57:53.344 --> 57:57.223
She says she's living
with a friend but won't let me visit.

57:59.559 --> 58:01.186
Right. Sorry, but I have to run.

58:01.269 --> 58:02.479
I'll make you something.

58:02.562 --> 58:04.481
It's okay. I bought a ticket to a show.

58:04.564 --> 58:06.024
But I feel bad.

58:06.107 --> 58:08.151
I'll visit again once it's open. Bye.

58:08.234 --> 58:09.569
Thanks. I'll call you.

58:10.445 --> 58:14.073
RACHMANINOFF

58:14.157 --> 58:17.619
2021 KOREAN SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA
JEONG HA-EUN'S RACHMANINOFF

58:34.594 --> 58:35.595
Hey.

58:36.596 --> 58:38.681
I'm in front of the box office. You?

58:41.851 --> 58:42.852
Really?

58:45.480 --> 58:46.773
That's a shame.

58:48.107 --> 58:49.734
Sure. Okay.

58:50.443 --> 58:51.444
Bye.

59:57.927 --> 59:59.512
It was a beautiful performance.

1:00:06.853 --> 1:00:07.729
Hey.

1:00:12.191 --> 1:00:13.192
We meet again.

1:00:14.402 --> 1:00:15.820
What a small world.

1:00:16.988 --> 1:00:18.197
I know, right?

1:00:21.492 --> 1:00:22.785
Are you here alone?

1:00:23.369 --> 1:00:24.203
Yes.

1:00:25.496 --> 1:00:26.706
Me too.

1:00:32.712 --> 1:00:34.172
Did you bring your car?

1:00:34.255 --> 1:00:36.257
No, I don't bring it to the theater.

1:00:36.341 --> 1:00:38.635
I see. I took a cab too.

1:00:42.388 --> 1:00:44.182
You can't have carbs this late, right?

1:00:46.934 --> 1:00:48.728
How about some beer?

1:00:49.812 --> 1:00:50.897
Sure.

1:01:01.366 --> 1:01:02.617
Do you like Rachmaninoff?

1:01:02.700 --> 1:01:06.371
I do. His music is easy on the ear
since it sounds like film music.

1:01:06.871 --> 1:01:08.289
You're right.

1:01:14.253 --> 1:01:16.923
By the way,
why is the orphanage special to you?

1:01:17.674 --> 1:01:19.676
I don't think
you grew up there like I did.

1:01:21.636 --> 1:01:23.680
My younger sister grew up there.

1:01:24.889 --> 1:01:26.307
I see.

1:01:27.225 --> 1:01:28.601
That's unexpected.

1:01:29.686 --> 1:01:33.064
You, her adoptive brother,
teach English at her orphanage.

1:01:34.107 --> 1:01:35.358
I was curious.

1:01:35.441 --> 1:01:38.945
I just suddenly wondered
what kind of place she grew up in.

1:01:41.030 --> 1:01:42.573
You two must be close.

1:01:44.367 --> 1:01:45.368
What about you?

1:01:45.910 --> 1:01:48.454
My older sister treats me very well,
and my parents are great.

1:01:51.374 --> 1:01:53.376
We have several things in common.

1:01:55.378 --> 1:01:56.212
You're right.

1:01:57.004 --> 1:02:00.883
Onnuri Child Care Center,
adoption, and Rachmaninoff.

1:02:02.427 --> 1:02:04.595
We have a few things in common,

1:02:05.555 --> 1:02:07.265
yet we're still strangers.

1:02:08.307 --> 1:02:09.308
How peculiar.

1:02:13.813 --> 1:02:15.356
That's a good thing, right?

1:02:21.529 --> 1:02:23.281
Now I like peonies too.

1:02:23.364 --> 1:02:26.784
That means we have
a total of four things in common.

1:02:28.035 --> 1:02:31.247
I was embarrassed when I sobered up.
I can't believe I took one.

1:02:38.838 --> 1:02:41.257
Would you like to come see them?

1:02:48.431 --> 1:02:49.766
Are you inviting me over?

1:02:52.560 --> 1:02:53.394
I am.

1:02:55.104 --> 1:02:57.815
To see the peonies?

1:03:03.279 --> 1:03:04.947
We only met twice,

1:03:05.865 --> 1:03:07.992
and you're already inviting me over?

1:03:10.077 --> 1:03:11.412
This is actually our third

1:03:12.205 --> 1:03:13.915
since we met at the orphanage.

1:03:22.298 --> 1:03:23.382
You're saying…

1:03:25.676 --> 1:03:27.428
that you want to sleep with me, right?

1:03:31.015 --> 1:03:32.099
Yes.

1:05:21.792 --> 1:05:25.922
Do you know what peonies symbolize?

1:05:27.798 --> 1:05:29.884
No, I don't.

1:05:29.967 --> 1:05:30.843
Shyness.

1:05:32.720 --> 1:05:33.763
It really doesn't suit

1:05:34.680 --> 1:05:36.265
what happened tonight.

1:05:47.193 --> 1:05:48.319
Thank you for the drink.

1:05:50.237 --> 1:05:51.238
Wait.

1:05:51.989 --> 1:05:52.990
Let's meet again.

1:05:56.118 --> 1:05:57.036
Next time,

1:05:58.120 --> 1:05:59.246
how about a movie?

1:06:03.834 --> 1:06:05.211
Do you not like me?

1:06:10.508 --> 1:06:14.220
I'll be leaving Korea soon.

1:06:15.471 --> 1:06:16.347
You're leaving?

1:06:17.515 --> 1:06:19.725
Yes. To the US.

1:06:21.102 --> 1:06:23.312
Does that mean you won't return?

1:06:25.272 --> 1:06:29.610
I probably will.
I'm taking a break for a year or two.

1:06:30.611 --> 1:06:31.612
Goodbye then.

1:06:33.823 --> 1:06:35.366
When are you leaving?

1:06:37.785 --> 1:06:39.870
In a month or two.

1:06:44.709 --> 1:06:46.335
Then we should meet a few times

1:06:47.044 --> 1:06:47.878
before you leave.

1:06:49.422 --> 1:06:50.423
Well…

1:06:51.173 --> 1:06:54.135
I don't think that's a good idea.

1:06:55.553 --> 1:06:56.554
Still.

1:06:58.931 --> 1:07:00.850
We should meet
at least once before you go.

1:07:09.483 --> 1:07:10.317
Okay.

1:07:11.986 --> 1:07:13.154
Goodbye.

1:07:13.738 --> 1:07:16.365
-Let me get you a cab.
-No. Don't come out.

1:07:16.449 --> 1:07:19.201
-I won't go far--
-No. I feel uncomfortable.

1:07:19.702 --> 1:07:23.914
What I mean is,
I feel more comfortable going alone.

1:07:23.998 --> 1:07:25.666
Goodbye.

1:08:22.181 --> 1:08:23.307
It's such…

1:08:25.851 --> 1:08:27.686
an alluring scent.

1:08:42.409 --> 1:08:43.494
What is it?

1:08:45.079 --> 1:08:45.996
Me?

1:08:46.872 --> 1:08:48.415
I'm at home.

1:08:51.043 --> 1:08:51.877
What?

1:08:58.551 --> 1:08:59.677
Chan-young.

1:09:00.678 --> 1:09:02.429
You're done here. You may leave.

1:09:02.513 --> 1:09:03.597
Yes, sir.

1:09:04.807 --> 1:09:07.810
You should be grateful
that I didn't take this any further.

1:09:08.853 --> 1:09:11.230
You should treat your wife better.

1:09:11.313 --> 1:09:13.232
-You little--
-Let's just go.

1:09:13.315 --> 1:09:15.693
-Let's go.
-That damn woman…

1:09:20.030 --> 1:09:21.031
Ms. Jeong.

1:09:22.032 --> 1:09:23.784
You may leave as well.

1:09:27.371 --> 1:09:28.372
Let's go.

1:09:35.963 --> 1:09:41.510
I think we've visited
one too many police stations.

1:09:42.720 --> 1:09:44.180
I'm used to them now.

1:09:44.763 --> 1:09:45.848
They feel cozy.

1:09:53.105 --> 1:09:54.398
Why did you do it?

1:09:58.068 --> 1:09:59.361
They're having an affair.

1:10:02.448 --> 1:10:03.949
But why would you care?

1:10:06.911 --> 1:10:07.786
I don't know.

1:10:08.704 --> 1:10:09.747
They made me angry.

1:10:11.874 --> 1:10:13.709
Why would you be angry?

1:10:14.543 --> 1:10:17.379
So what if they're having an affair?
Why would you slap them?

1:10:19.340 --> 1:10:21.425
Do Jin-seok and I look like them

1:10:22.134 --> 1:10:23.052
in your eyes?

1:10:25.304 --> 1:10:26.722
Do we look filthy?

1:10:32.228 --> 1:10:33.520
Double standards.

1:10:34.897 --> 1:10:37.066
It really hits home, doesn't it?

1:10:38.067 --> 1:10:40.486
If I do it, it's love.
If others do, it's an affair.

1:10:41.779 --> 1:10:43.364
Chan-young, that's why…

1:10:45.908 --> 1:10:47.326
you should…

1:10:47.409 --> 1:10:48.661
But you know what, Mi-jo?

1:10:49.912 --> 1:10:51.455
It's love for me.

1:10:53.624 --> 1:10:56.502
I've always loved him.

1:11:03.467 --> 1:11:04.843
But who'll understand you?

1:11:08.222 --> 1:11:10.307
Jin-seok is married, and that's a fact.

1:11:18.565 --> 1:11:19.566
You know what?

1:11:20.609 --> 1:11:23.153
I should've just
fully enjoyed my affair with him.

1:11:25.364 --> 1:11:27.866
I should've just left you
back at the station.

1:11:32.288 --> 1:11:33.872
You reek of alcohol.

1:11:36.208 --> 1:11:37.626
I had a drink.

1:11:38.294 --> 1:11:39.336
With whom?

1:11:40.629 --> 1:11:41.505
A guy.

1:11:42.673 --> 1:11:45.092
Hey, I know
you didn't do anything with him.

1:11:45.175 --> 1:11:47.469
So why would you
risk your liver like that?

1:11:49.179 --> 1:11:51.181
I finally had my romantic moment,

1:11:51.932 --> 1:11:53.517
but then you called me.

1:11:54.393 --> 1:11:55.602
You're a terrible friend.

1:11:57.438 --> 1:11:58.981
A romantic moment?

1:12:05.612 --> 1:12:06.613
Did you do it?

1:12:08.407 --> 1:12:10.075
Let's go home.

1:12:10.159 --> 1:12:11.994
Hey, I'm calling Joo-hee.

1:12:12.077 --> 1:12:13.370
Don't call her.

1:12:13.454 --> 1:12:16.749
Mi-jo. You… Hold on. How long has it been?

1:12:16.832 --> 1:12:19.835
-Don't count, you crazy brat.
-Hold on.

1:12:19.918 --> 1:12:22.921
-Joo-hee must be asleep.
-Wait. Where's her number?

1:12:23.005 --> 1:12:25.466
-Come on.
-Joo-hee, were you sleeping?

1:12:25.549 --> 1:12:28.385
Hey, Joo-hee.
Chan-young is just a bit crazy right now.

1:12:28.469 --> 1:12:31.013
-Go back to bed.
<i>-What? You drank without me?</i>

1:12:31.096 --> 1:12:33.223
-No. Go to bed.
-You shouldn't be sleeping!

1:12:33.307 --> 1:12:34.725
<i>-What is it?</i>
-Sleep tight.

1:12:34.808 --> 1:12:36.935
Goodness. Did you have to wake her up?

1:12:40.230 --> 1:12:41.398
Right.

1:12:41.482 --> 1:12:43.275
I'm meeting the new director today.

1:12:43.359 --> 1:12:44.818
How do you know them?

1:12:44.902 --> 1:12:46.362
Through Jin-seok.

1:12:47.029 --> 1:12:50.407
We couldn't find
the right time to meet until now.

1:12:51.075 --> 1:12:53.994
When did you prepare everything? When?

1:12:54.828 --> 1:12:58.207
You came up with
a meticulous plan before fleeing abroad.

1:12:58.290 --> 1:13:01.043
Should we find a substitute for you too?

1:13:01.126 --> 1:13:03.045
Would you like to come with me, Ms. Cha?

1:13:03.128 --> 1:13:04.296
And see the clinic go up in flames?

1:13:10.177 --> 1:13:12.429
You better tell Mom and Dad
about this soon.

1:13:13.639 --> 1:13:16.642
I don't know how to.
I should though, right?

1:13:17.851 --> 1:13:19.061
Care to accompany me?

1:13:19.895 --> 1:13:22.356
Why? Too scared to face them by yourself?

1:13:23.524 --> 1:13:24.358
A bit.

1:13:30.864 --> 1:13:32.658
-This place is nice.
-Right?

1:13:41.375 --> 1:13:43.627
<i>I'm really sorry,
but I don't think I can make it.</i>

1:13:43.710 --> 1:13:45.462
<i>Chan-young suddenly called.</i>

1:13:45.546 --> 1:13:47.589
<i>She didn't sound happy. I'm really sorry.</i>

1:13:58.559 --> 1:13:59.560
Chan-young.

1:14:01.061 --> 1:14:03.063
What is it? Is something wrong?

1:14:04.565 --> 1:14:06.233
Can you divorce her when you're 50?

1:14:07.234 --> 1:14:09.403
-Chan-young--
-I can wait until you're 60 too.

1:14:09.486 --> 1:14:12.156
As long as you'll divorce her, I can wait.

1:14:18.495 --> 1:14:19.663
Is it a yes or a no?

1:14:20.289 --> 1:14:21.540
Is that what you want?

1:14:23.625 --> 1:14:24.751
Yes.

1:14:31.592 --> 1:14:32.801
I don't think you can.

1:14:36.513 --> 1:14:39.308
I don't think you'll ever
get a divorce, Jin-seok.

1:14:46.565 --> 1:14:48.442
-Chan-young.
-I quit smoking.

1:14:50.652 --> 1:14:51.987
I’m going to quit you too.

1:16:23.829 --> 1:16:25.497
Director Cha Mi-jo?

1:16:25.581 --> 1:16:27.791
Doctor Kim Seon-u?

1:16:39.261 --> 1:16:41.597
<i>Some of us had a new beginning</i>

1:16:41.680 --> 1:16:43.265
<i>and some faced an end</i>

1:16:44.600 --> 1:16:45.475
<i>when we were…</i>

1:16:47.894 --> 1:16:49.313
<i>thirty-nine.</i>

1:17:28.602 --> 1:17:30.145
This is a really nice way to start things.

1:17:31.897 --> 1:17:33.315
Didn't you break up today?

1:17:33.398 --> 1:17:34.608
Hey.

1:17:34.691 --> 1:17:36.610
<i>Deep down inside,</i>

1:17:37.152 --> 1:17:40.364
I always feel anxious
because I was adopted.

1:17:40.989 --> 1:17:42.616
-Kim Seon-u?
-Come on. Show us.

1:17:42.699 --> 1:17:44.242
-Hey, stop it!
-I'll do it.

1:17:44.868 --> 1:17:48.455
I was going to text you back
but I accidentally called you.

1:17:49.831 --> 1:17:51.291
<i>That's not going to happen.</i>

1:17:51.375 --> 1:17:53.168
<i>That's not going to happen to us.</i>

1:17:53.251 --> 1:17:54.211
<i>You!</i>

1:17:55.754 --> 1:17:57.714
I'll kill you!

1:17:58.924 --> 1:18:03.428
