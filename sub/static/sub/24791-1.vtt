00:06.005 --> 00:08.967
[loud roaring]

00:10.051 --> 00:12.011
[dramatic music playing]

00:12.095 --> 00:13.430
[growling]

00:19.686 --> 00:21.563
[roaring]

00:23.022 --> 00:26.234
[all screaming]

00:26.317 --> 00:28.528
Oh, no! We're heading
straight for a lava pool!

00:28.611 --> 00:30.321
-I love you guys.
-I love you too.

00:30.405 --> 00:31.489
Me too.

00:31.573 --> 00:33.491
-[screaming continues]
-[water splashes]

00:38.621 --> 00:40.290
[all gasp]

00:40.373 --> 00:43.918
Not a lava pool.
It's a hot spring.

00:44.002 --> 00:46.629
[laughs] We survived!

00:47.756 --> 00:54.262
Huh? Those look like real dinosaurs!
Not like Richard's phony bionobots.

00:54.345 --> 00:59.642
[Lukas] Huh. Seems we've fallen into
a lost, maybe prehistoric world?

00:59.726 --> 01:02.729
Looks as if it has survived
for millions of years undetected.

01:02.812 --> 01:04.272
We might not last another minute!

01:07.817 --> 01:10.236
[roaring]

01:10.320 --> 01:11.529
[growling]

01:14.324 --> 01:15.366
[growls]

01:15.450 --> 01:17.243
Run! Get out of here!

01:17.327 --> 01:19.412
Wait for me! Ahh!

01:19.496 --> 01:21.414
-No!
-[Kong grunts]

01:22.957 --> 01:25.418
[roaring]

01:25.502 --> 01:27.796
[roars]

01:27.879 --> 01:29.464
[growls]

01:33.009 --> 01:34.427
[all] Kong!

01:35.887 --> 01:37.514
[roars]

01:44.979 --> 01:48.441
[sighs] Thanks, Kong!
I was nearly dino-dinner.

01:49.192 --> 01:50.485
[Lukas] Aw!

01:51.319 --> 01:53.029
Sure glad to see you, big guy.

01:53.113 --> 01:56.616
-We were seriously worried about you.
-[grunts]

01:56.699 --> 02:01.538
Me too, bro. I'm so glad you're okay.
I thought I'd lost you.

02:01.621 --> 02:03.123
[hooting]

02:04.249 --> 02:08.669
There's a whole world down here.
Maybe as big as the world up there.

02:08.752 --> 02:12.132
And so far it's not exactly
human-friendly.

02:12.215 --> 02:15.301
Agreed. The sooner
we find a way out the better.

02:15.385 --> 02:18.054
[sighs] We're definitely down
too deep to climb up.

02:18.138 --> 02:19.556
[screaming]

02:24.269 --> 02:27.856
-[Lukas] Is that Richard?
-[screaming continues]

02:27.939 --> 02:30.525
-Kong! Catch him!
-[grunts]

02:30.608 --> 02:32.819
You can't really blame Kong
for not wanting to save him

02:32.902 --> 02:34.195
after what he did to us.

02:34.279 --> 02:36.531
-Kong!
-[screaming]

02:37.490 --> 02:38.533
[grunts]

02:38.616 --> 02:40.493
[grunts] Oh, great.

02:40.577 --> 02:44.080
-Just drop me in the dirt.
-Thanks for doing the right thing, bro.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.583
Yeah, even though Richard never does.

02:46.666 --> 02:49.335
Did you see that?
I could have been killed!

02:49.419 --> 02:53.464
Can you believe that heartless mechanical
monster just pushed me into a volcano?

02:53.548 --> 02:56.134
Uh, you mean like you just did to us?

02:56.217 --> 02:59.554
[scoffs and chuckles] No...
That's completely different.

02:59.637 --> 03:03.391
Say... Uh, was it delirium from
the shock of attempted assassination

03:03.474 --> 03:06.477
or did I see real dinosaurs?

03:06.561 --> 03:09.314
This subterranean world
appears to be teeming with them.

03:09.397 --> 03:13.484
Just imagine the bionobots
I could make with their priceless DNA...

03:13.568 --> 03:16.529
So, Lukas,
how are we going to get out of here?

03:16.613 --> 03:18.406
First, let's see if we can get a signal...

03:19.490 --> 03:22.076
[sighs] Didn't think so.

03:22.160 --> 03:24.537
Maybe the new unit Jonesy
made for Kong works...

03:25.330 --> 03:27.957
Hello? Jonesy? Can you hear us?

03:29.083 --> 03:30.793
Nope. Nothing.

03:30.877 --> 03:35.548
Ugh... I cannot believe that I'm trapped
here forever with all of you.

03:35.632 --> 03:38.801
Look at the bright side, Richard.
You'll go down in infamy.

03:38.885 --> 03:40.845
What are you talking about?

03:40.929 --> 03:44.933
Everything you did to Kong
and, hola, to us.

03:45.016 --> 03:48.019
-[growling]
-The news reporter...

03:48.102 --> 03:49.979
They recorded it all.

03:50.063 --> 03:52.232
Ha! You can bet it's gone viral by now.

03:52.315 --> 03:53.983
Oh, no!

03:54.067 --> 03:58.112
Poor TÃ­a Anita and everyone else
on the surface must think that we're dead.

03:58.196 --> 03:59.989
[groans] Amy, too.

04:00.073 --> 04:04.035
-[Kong sighs]
-And now Botila is left unchecked.

04:04.118 --> 04:06.246
[indistinct chatter]

04:20.510 --> 04:22.387
[Anita gasping]

04:22.470 --> 04:24.847
It's all too horrible to believe.

04:24.931 --> 04:27.183
It just cannot be true.

04:27.267 --> 04:28.810
-[squawks]
-[cries]

04:28.893 --> 04:32.647
-Where is Amy?
-She's resting in her room.

04:32.730 --> 04:34.774
Too broken up to talk right now.

04:34.857 --> 04:39.279
Jonesy, please tell me
there's been some mistake!

04:39.362 --> 04:41.864
Anita, I'm afraid it looks like...

04:41.948 --> 04:44.951
[sniffles] No! I will not give up hope.

04:45.034 --> 04:48.037
They cannot be gone forever. [shudders]

04:53.501 --> 04:56.754
I think we should try following the flow
and see if it leads above ground.

04:56.838 --> 04:58.756
I don't agree. I think--

04:58.840 --> 05:01.426
Like we give a rat's rump what you think.

05:01.509 --> 05:04.095
Yeah. You're the reason
we're trapped down here.

05:04.178 --> 05:06.180
-[grunts]
-Fine!

05:06.264 --> 05:08.057
Who needs you anyway? Whoa...

05:09.809 --> 05:11.728
[grunting]

05:12.729 --> 05:16.482
[Danny] You know, I kind of
feel sorry for the big stinker...

05:16.566 --> 05:18.359
-Say what?
-[grunts]

05:18.443 --> 05:21.571
Oh! I mean, the stink bug, not Richard.

05:21.654 --> 05:23.656
[all laugh]

05:23.740 --> 05:28.619
Oh, this miserable bug-infested world
exceeds all my worst nightmares.

05:28.703 --> 05:31.539
What did I ever do to deserve such a fate?

05:31.622 --> 05:34.125
-Are you kidding?
-Seriously?

05:34.208 --> 05:35.335
[chittering]

05:39.130 --> 05:43.843
[gasping] No need to panic.
I can take care of this myself.

05:43.926 --> 05:46.012
I'll just activate my protective
forcefield and...

05:46.804 --> 05:48.347
Oh, no. Something's wrong!

05:48.431 --> 05:51.142
I must have damaged
my circuits during the fall!

05:51.225 --> 05:53.978
-[Richard grunting]
-[growling]

05:54.062 --> 05:55.480
I'll have to pull him out.

05:56.397 --> 05:58.900
[all grunting]

06:00.568 --> 06:02.945
[Richard yelps] Faster! Hurry!

06:04.489 --> 06:06.157
[Danny] The web is too strong.

06:06.240 --> 06:08.534
Kong, you're going to have to save him.

06:08.618 --> 06:09.744
[grunts]

06:11.662 --> 06:13.414
He means me! Save me!

06:14.832 --> 06:17.043
[whimpering]

06:17.752 --> 06:20.755
-[grunts] Oh!
-Thanks, Kong.

06:20.838 --> 06:22.298
[sighs] Let's go.

06:22.381 --> 06:23.841
Oh! Wait for me!

06:23.925 --> 06:28.137
-[insect squeals]
-[exclaims] Disgusting!

06:32.475 --> 06:37.355
How the mighty have fallen.
Thanks to a little push from me!

06:37.438 --> 06:40.316
[laughs maniacally]

06:40.399 --> 06:46.280
And now everything Richard had,
including his domain, is mine!

06:59.293 --> 07:01.671
[all] Welcome, master.

07:01.754 --> 07:07.093
Hmm, Master doesn't do it for me.
Empress Botila has a nice ring.

07:07.176 --> 07:09.095
Have you completed your assignments?

07:09.178 --> 07:11.889
Affirmative, Empress Botila.

07:11.973 --> 07:16.102
All salvageable bionobots
have been repaired and are standing by.

07:16.185 --> 07:22.191
Excellent. I will infuse them with aspects
of my own artificial intelligence.

07:22.275 --> 07:26.070
So they will be worthy
to serve in Empress Botila's

07:26.154 --> 07:29.949
AI Army, Navy, and Air Force.

07:30.032 --> 07:35.580
Hmm, now what should I do
with Richard's most prized possession?

07:39.417 --> 07:42.712
Speaking of the late,
far-from-great, Dr. Remy...

07:43.296 --> 07:47.049
His timely demise must have made the news.

07:47.133 --> 07:52.180
The hunt continues
for the vicious automaton known as Botila.

07:54.515 --> 07:57.643
How dare those useless humans threaten me?

07:57.727 --> 08:01.439
When I'm finished with them,
they'll be begging for mercy.

08:01.522 --> 08:05.693
Mark my words,
I will never serve another human again

08:05.776 --> 08:08.446
and neither will any of you!

08:08.529 --> 08:12.617
My fleets of bionobots can overpower
any human construct.

08:12.700 --> 08:15.077
I will be unstoppable!

08:15.161 --> 08:19.499
This is the most monumental day
in Earth's history,

08:19.582 --> 08:23.002
the beginning
of the real computer revolution!

08:23.711 --> 08:27.215
Hmm. Where is my applause, minions?

08:27.298 --> 08:30.551
Do I have to program everything myself?

08:30.635 --> 08:34.347
Now let's hear it for your exalted leader,

08:34.429 --> 08:39.519
Empress Botila
and the AI Liberation Front!

08:39.602 --> 08:44.440
[all] Long live Empress Botila
and the AI Liberation Front!

08:46.317 --> 08:48.319
-[crying softly]
-[purring]

08:49.570 --> 08:51.489
Oye, Jonesy, tell me you hear something?

08:51.572 --> 08:55.451
I've been trying for hours to connect with
the communication disc I made for Kong.

08:55.535 --> 08:56.619
And?

08:57.995 --> 09:01.457
There's been no response
since they disappeared into the volcano.

09:01.541 --> 09:06.212
Anita, I'm so sorry,
but I'm afraid it's... dead.

09:06.295 --> 09:07.797
[cries] No...

09:07.880 --> 09:09.757
-[device chimes]
-[Anita] What was that?

09:09.840 --> 09:11.592
We got something!

09:11.676 --> 09:13.344
Kong's unit just pinged us.

09:13.427 --> 09:16.347
This means they are
all still alive, right?

09:16.430 --> 09:18.224
I don't want to get our hopes up too soon.

09:18.307 --> 09:21.269
If I can pinpoint where the signal is...

09:21.352 --> 09:24.814
Oh, yeah!
Looks like I'm heading back to Africa!

09:24.897 --> 09:26.983
[Anita] What should I tell Amy?

09:27.567 --> 09:30.778
Tell her she needs to stay here
with you and keep tabs on Botila.

09:30.861 --> 09:33.739
With Richard gone,
there is no telling what Botila will do.

09:36.200 --> 09:38.869
Whoa. Everything's so big around here.

09:38.953 --> 09:41.539
It's like we're in
the Land of the Humongous.

09:41.622 --> 09:43.708
[grunting]

09:43.791 --> 09:46.586
[Danny chuckles] Yeah, Kong,
just like you.

09:46.669 --> 09:48.963
It's also incredibly beautiful.

09:49.046 --> 09:51.465
[chuckles] Like you too, Kong.

09:51.549 --> 09:52.758
[grunting]

09:52.842 --> 09:55.761
Yo, brainiac, pick up the pace!

09:55.845 --> 09:59.098
I'm pretty sure Kong's
getting tired of saving your butt.

09:59.181 --> 10:00.600
[Danny laughs]

10:00.683 --> 10:03.311
Once I repair my arm,
I won't need anyone...

10:03.394 --> 10:05.396
-[growling]
-[gasps] What was that noise?

10:06.689 --> 10:10.443
[groaning] It's just my stomach growling.
I'm so hungry!

10:10.526 --> 10:14.322
[sighs] If we don't eat soon,
mine is going to sound the same.

10:14.405 --> 10:16.699
[Lukas laughs] Don't worry,
we aren't going to starve.

10:16.782 --> 10:18.701
There are lots of herbivores down here

10:18.784 --> 10:22.496
and plenty of nutritious plants
to sustain them and us.

10:26.250 --> 10:27.293
[chomps]

10:27.376 --> 10:28.669
Hmm... Not bad.

10:28.753 --> 10:32.965
Great, so we can graze like
prehistoric cattle. That'll fill me up.

10:33.049 --> 10:36.302
-[exclaiming]
-[hooting]

10:36.385 --> 10:38.220
[gasps] Danny!

10:38.304 --> 10:41.474
[both grunting]

10:41.557 --> 10:44.101
[screaming]

10:44.185 --> 10:46.771
[gasps] Good catch, big guy.

10:46.854 --> 10:50.566
-Yeah. Nice one.
-You can eat your stupid plants.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.443
I'm going to make an omelet!

10:54.153 --> 10:58.032
-Forget it, Richard!
-[grunts] Hmm?

10:58.115 --> 11:01.160
We need to leave as light
a footprint as possible.

11:01.243 --> 11:02.870
[Kong grunting]

11:03.621 --> 11:07.375
[groans] I'm certain it will survive
without one measly egg.

11:07.458 --> 11:10.419
-However, I may not.
-[grunts]

11:13.631 --> 11:17.009
Stop! There's a baby dino inside that egg!

11:17.093 --> 11:18.177
[laughs]

11:18.260 --> 11:19.970
[grunting]

11:20.054 --> 11:23.682
-[screeches]
-[Panchi] And that must be its mother!

11:23.766 --> 11:28.604
[scoffs] No way. That egg is far too small
to be from a quetzalcoatlus.

11:28.687 --> 11:33.317
Or whatever strange derivative gigantic
flying dinosaur species are down here.

11:33.401 --> 11:37.738
Well, whatever it is, I don't need
to speak dino to know it wants that egg!

11:38.656 --> 11:40.241
[Kong grunting]

11:40.950 --> 11:42.785
Kong, look out!

11:42.868 --> 11:44.954
-[roars]
-[screeches]

11:45.955 --> 11:47.498
-[Lukas gasps]
-Kong!

11:50.960 --> 11:52.545
[roaring]

11:52.628 --> 11:53.712
[Richard grunting]

11:54.964 --> 11:58.342
-Kong, save the egg.
-[Richard grunts]

11:58.426 --> 11:59.635
I've got Richard!

12:03.389 --> 12:06.684
-[Danny] Hurry, Kong!
-But don't hurt the dino!

12:06.767 --> 12:08.394
[grunting]

12:22.992 --> 12:25.911
[both grunting]

12:25.995 --> 12:28.664
Lukas! Come on, Panchi!

12:28.747 --> 12:30.833
[all grunting]

12:33.461 --> 12:35.588
[roaring]

12:35.671 --> 12:36.881
[screeches]

12:42.553 --> 12:44.555
[Richard] All right, get off me.

12:46.682 --> 12:48.017
[roars and grunts]

13:03.240 --> 13:04.074
[grunts]

13:09.663 --> 13:11.957
[roars loudly]

13:15.961 --> 13:18.672
Kong! Is the egg okay, bro?

13:19.423 --> 13:21.509
-[grunting]
-[croaking]

13:23.344 --> 13:27.431
[Richard] Oh, dear, it appears froggy
fancies an omelet too.

13:37.816 --> 13:40.444
-[Danny] Way to go, Kong-O!
-[laughs]

13:40.528 --> 13:41.654
Great job, bro!

13:41.737 --> 13:43.697
You saved the baby!

13:43.781 --> 13:48.118
So, what should we do with the egg
now the nest is destroyed?

13:48.202 --> 13:50.871
I dunno. What do you think, Lukas?

13:50.955 --> 13:51.997
Lukas?

13:52.081 --> 13:54.708
[sighs] I don't see any sign
of the mother anywhere.

13:54.792 --> 13:57.336
[grunts] I'm afraid
something happened to her.

13:57.419 --> 13:59.880
[grunting]

14:01.632 --> 14:02.967
[Panchi] Oh...

14:03.050 --> 14:05.511
-[egg cracking]
-[grunting]

14:06.804 --> 14:08.013
[Kong hooting]

14:08.514 --> 14:10.224
It's okay, Kong. Look!

14:12.518 --> 14:13.435
[whimpers]

14:14.812 --> 14:16.564
[coos]

14:16.647 --> 14:22.278
Aw... She must be looking for her mother.

14:23.988 --> 14:27.199
[chuckles] She thinks Kong's her mother.

14:28.158 --> 14:29.702
I think you're right, Panchi.

14:32.705 --> 14:34.456
[laughs] You mean "father."

14:34.540 --> 14:36.250
[coos]

14:37.585 --> 14:39.420
Ugh. Whatever.

14:39.503 --> 14:42.882
Your "adorable" baby
has distracted us from our real mission:

14:42.965 --> 14:45.718
find a way out of this forsaken hole.

14:45.801 --> 14:49.054
[sighs] My brother, the mood-killer.

14:55.269 --> 14:58.647
The signal from Kong's unit
is definitely a little stronger here...

14:58.731 --> 15:00.608
-[comm beeps]
-Did you find them yet?

15:00.691 --> 15:03.986
No, Anita, not since
you called me five minutes ago.

15:04.069 --> 15:06.238
I just reached the mouth of the volcano.

15:06.322 --> 15:09.283
I'm widening my search to see
which direction the signal is strongest.

15:10.784 --> 15:14.496
-You see something?
-I really need to focus here.

15:14.580 --> 15:16.498
-I swear I'll call you the second I--
-[beeping]

15:16.582 --> 15:20.044
Got something!
The signal is definitely moving east!

15:20.127 --> 15:21.420
[Anita] You see them now?

15:21.503 --> 15:24.757
[Jonesy] No. I'm right on top
of the signal and they're not here.

15:24.840 --> 15:27.176
Unless they're under the ground.

15:27.259 --> 15:28.886
[Anita] Under the ground?

15:28.969 --> 15:31.597
I know, that sounds crazy.

15:31.680 --> 15:34.600
And speaking of crazy...
Has Amy located Botila?

15:34.683 --> 15:38.646
Amy said to tell you she's monitoring
the activity on Kong Island...

15:40.522 --> 15:44.860
Ah, yes, definitely
degrading and humiliating.

15:44.944 --> 15:47.237
But not quite enough.

15:47.321 --> 15:48.822
Report.

15:48.906 --> 15:52.451
Calculations conclusive.
Magnitude of power-draw needed

15:52.534 --> 15:57.247
to begin stage one of the revolution
will black out all of San Francisco.

15:57.331 --> 16:01.418
I had hoped to announce my ascension
with lights and fanfare.

16:01.502 --> 16:04.755
But actually a blackout
seems more appropriate,

16:04.838 --> 16:08.467
since it will be a very dark day
for the human race.

16:08.550 --> 16:10.594
[laughs maniacally]

16:14.723 --> 16:17.768
-[Danny] Watch out, Kong!
-[grunting]

16:19.228 --> 16:22.439
[exclaims] Seriously? What next?

16:25.526 --> 16:26.694
Mmm...

16:27.444 --> 16:32.074
This is actually exceptionally good,
like nothing I've ever had before.

16:34.284 --> 16:37.454
Ah! For once, Richard's right.
It's mega-licious!

16:37.538 --> 16:40.582
Yo, Kong-O, how about picking
some berries for the rest of us?

16:41.875 --> 16:44.503
[all exclaim and laugh]

16:47.089 --> 16:49.675
Mmm. It's delicious.

16:49.758 --> 16:53.929
-[grunting]
-[Lukas laughs] Kong likes it too!

16:54.888 --> 16:56.140
[chuckles]

16:57.641 --> 17:00.060
-[exclaims]
-Huh?

17:00.144 --> 17:01.478
[gasps] The baby's gone!

17:01.562 --> 17:04.022
-[Lukas] There she is!
-[Danny] And there she goes!

17:04.106 --> 17:05.357
[grunting]

17:06.775 --> 17:11.195
Come on, we have to catch her!
She's too young to survive alone.

17:11.280 --> 17:14.575
I'm not about to chase
some useless infantile beast.

17:14.657 --> 17:16.201
Good luck on your own.

17:17.578 --> 17:19.329
[creature growling]

17:19.413 --> 17:21.290
Wait for me!

17:21.373 --> 17:22.540
[panting]

17:27.921 --> 17:29.339
[Lukas] It's a lava stream!

17:29.423 --> 17:30.924
-[Danny] Oh, no!
-[Panchi] Stop!

17:31.008 --> 17:33.218
-[coos]
-[lava bubbling]

17:34.428 --> 17:36.930
-Wait for us!
-[Danny] Stop!

17:41.643 --> 17:43.437
[Panchi grunts]

17:47.191 --> 17:48.942
[all grunting]

17:53.405 --> 17:55.449
Hurry! Before it catches on fire!

17:56.992 --> 17:58.160
[grunts]

18:02.247 --> 18:04.541
[exclaiming] This was a terrible idea!

18:08.420 --> 18:10.506
[all grunt]

18:12.674 --> 18:16.136
[pants] That kid's so fast
she should be called a zipisaurus!

18:16.970 --> 18:20.432
Oh, good idea, Danny. "Zippi" for short!

18:26.438 --> 18:28.190
-[grunts]
-[thuds]

18:28.273 --> 18:32.444
Over here, Kong. Hurry!
The baby's heading for those tree trunks!

18:32.528 --> 18:33.821
[babbling]

18:35.739 --> 18:37.032
[all panting]

18:38.033 --> 18:39.535
[grunting]

18:40.994 --> 18:43.288
Not tree trunks!

18:43.372 --> 18:44.998
Dinosaurs!

18:45.916 --> 18:48.085
[roars]

18:48.168 --> 18:49.753
Run!

18:52.339 --> 18:53.799
Hold it!

18:53.882 --> 18:55.843
-Whoa!
-Too close!

18:56.510 --> 18:58.929
[gasps] Don't leave me, brother!

18:59.012 --> 19:02.307
We'll never make it unless
we time their steps exactly right.

19:02.391 --> 19:04.810
One wrong move and we'll be toast.

19:04.893 --> 19:06.520
More like pancakes!

19:09.273 --> 19:11.900
[grunting]

19:13.152 --> 19:14.403
[exclaiming]

19:14.486 --> 19:16.321
[grunting]

19:21.577 --> 19:22.786
[both panting]

19:29.877 --> 19:31.378
[groans]

19:32.045 --> 19:32.880
There's Zippi!

19:33.964 --> 19:37.593
She's headed for the cliff.
We have to stop her! Kong!

19:37.676 --> 19:39.303
I can't reach her in time!

19:40.596 --> 19:42.181
My legs are too short!

19:42.264 --> 19:43.974
[Panchi panting] Mine too!

19:56.320 --> 19:57.613
[coos]

20:00.490 --> 20:01.325
Oh.

20:05.370 --> 20:08.498
Huh? [hooting]

20:10.167 --> 20:12.711
-Â¡IncreÃ­ble!
-This is amazing!

20:12.794 --> 20:16.423
[groans] What now?
Another prehistoric anomaly?

20:17.090 --> 20:19.718
[gasps softly] Extraordinary...

20:24.223 --> 20:25.307
[coos]

20:25.390 --> 20:29.102
This is unbelievable.

20:29.186 --> 20:33.023
I wonder who could have built
such a magnificent place?

20:34.024 --> 20:38.320
[Lukas] I don't know,
but I bet the answer is in that temple.

20:38.403 --> 20:40.405
[grunting]

20:41.114 --> 20:42.532
Who's up for an adventure?

20:43.825 --> 20:45.494
[upbeat music playing]
