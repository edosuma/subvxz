WEBVTT

00:01.736 --> 00:02.735
SHE PANTS

00:02.760 --> 00:03.636
ARSEHOLE GUY:
Oh yeah.

00:03.680 --> 00:04.511
Yeah!
- ARSEHOLE GUY: Phew.

00:04.560 --> 00:05.277
Oh!

00:05.320 --> 00:06.799
Oh, look at me!

00:06.840 --> 00:07.716
HE PANTS

00:07.760 --> 00:09.280
I want to see those tiny things again.

00:10.600 --> 00:11.749
Eh. Huh.

00:11.800 --> 00:13.074
SHE PANTS

00:13.120 --> 00:15.430
Stay sexy. Always stay sexy.

00:15.480 --> 00:17.153
ARSEHOLE GUY:
Those tits. Uh.

00:17.200 --> 00:18.270
Ooh.

00:18.320 --> 00:19.469
Oh.
- Ah, yes.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.431
So... fucking tiny.

00:22.000 --> 00:23.070
May I, er...

00:25.360 --> 00:26.395
oh, yeah.

00:26.440 --> 00:28.158
HE PANTS

00:32.119 --> 00:33.120
Um...

00:36.280 --> 00:37.395
Oh God.

00:38.200 --> 00:40.640
There's always a stage when someone's
falling in love with you

00:40.680 --> 00:42.353
that they lose their erection.

00:43.280 --> 00:46.989
They get confused. They panic.
The stakes get too high

00:47.560 --> 00:49.836
the blood rushes from
their dick to their heart.

00:49.880 --> 00:50.676
Oh Jesus.

00:50.720 --> 00:53.712
And everything is fucked!

01:01.240 --> 01:02.240
FLEABAG GASPS

01:03.280 --> 01:04.280
What?

01:05.960 --> 01:08.270
Ah, no, I don't think Hilary's
gonna wanna hear this.

01:08.320 --> 01:09.320
No, go on.

01:11.320 --> 01:12.320
No.

01:12.360 --> 01:13.360
No, go on.

01:13.840 --> 01:17.356
OK. An 11-year-old boy
was put in juvenile prison

01:17.400 --> 01:21.394
for repeatedly sticking rubber ended
pencils up the school hamster's arsehole.

01:21.976 --> 01:22.976
What?

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
Yeah.

01:24.120 --> 01:25.554
Why would they do that?

01:26.080 --> 01:28.040
Apparently he liked it when
their eyes popped out.

01:28.064 --> 01:30.738
No, why would they send him away?
He needs help.

01:31.600 --> 01:33.159
She was a surprising person.

01:34.680 --> 01:36.200
They shouldn't have
just looked him up.

01:36.240 --> 01:37.958
He pencil fucked a hamster.

01:38.280 --> 01:41.400
Yeah, but he's obviously not happy -
happy people wouldn't do things like that!

01:41.424 --> 01:42.151
Fair point.

01:42.200 --> 01:46.114
And anyway, that's the very reason why
they put rubbers on the end of pencils.

01:46.160 --> 01:47.719
What, to fuck hamsters?

01:47.760 --> 01:50.639
No. Because people make mistakes.

01:53.480 --> 01:54.480
ARSEHOLE GUY:
Hey.

01:59.280 --> 02:00.280
Hey.

02:00.960 --> 02:01.960
Hey.

02:03.960 --> 02:04.995
Look, about last night.

02:05.600 --> 02:06.600
Uh oh.

02:07.040 --> 02:09.031
I don't usually connect with women.

02:09.360 --> 02:11.112
I know,
that's what I like about you.

02:11.800 --> 02:17.273
Yeah. OK. Um... I, er...

02:18.920 --> 02:20.194
HE EXHALES

02:20.600 --> 02:21.600
Wow.

02:22.400 --> 02:23.435
HE EXHALES

02:24.320 --> 02:25.840
This must be what insecure feels like.

02:27.840 --> 02:29.440
Actually, can we speak about this later?

02:29.464 --> 02:31.899
I want to find the right words for you.

02:32.320 --> 02:33.600
I'll see you at the sexhibition?

02:34.400 --> 02:35.400
Yeah, see you there.

02:36.040 --> 02:37.075
I'm gonna go to yoga.

02:37.360 --> 02:38.360
OK.

02:46.896 --> 02:47.896
GODMOTHER GASPS

02:47.920 --> 02:49.479
Ooh. Marvellous.

02:49.520 --> 02:51.431
I'm so relieved you're here.

02:51.480 --> 02:52.480
Hi.

02:56.240 --> 02:57.992
And hello, good looking.
- FLEABAG: Hi.

02:58.040 --> 02:59.040
Hello.

02:59.680 --> 03:00.680
Thank you.

03:01.840 --> 03:02.875
FLEABAG:
Thank you.

03:03.920 --> 03:04.920
Well clung to.

03:05.560 --> 03:06.560
Thank you.

03:08.040 --> 03:09.040
Does it get very boring

03:09.080 --> 03:11.549
everybody telling you how
gorgeous you are all the time?

03:12.480 --> 03:14.039
Er... a little.

03:14.520 --> 03:15.555
Should we, er...

03:15.960 --> 03:17.837
Oh, yes, I won't forget this, I promise.

03:17.880 --> 03:19.040
Oh, sure. Is Claire here yet?

03:19.440 --> 03:22.159
No, not yet.
You're an angel for being here.

03:23.240 --> 03:25.470
Would you just hold onto that

03:25.520 --> 03:28.911
and there are bottles for topping up
on the little bar just inside.

03:29.680 --> 03:31.159
I'm the luckiest thing to have you.

03:31.840 --> 03:34.798
And erm... there.

03:37.680 --> 03:38.715
You're a natural.

03:48.880 --> 03:52.953
No, really though, this sexhibition isn't
about me trying to get you all aroused

03:53.240 --> 03:55.516
it's about the beauty of sex

03:55.560 --> 03:57.278
and how it brings us all together.

03:57.680 --> 04:00.240
How it excites and connects

04:00.520 --> 04:02.352
how it opens people's minds.

04:02.880 --> 04:04.678
After all, sex got us all here.

04:05.120 --> 04:07.475
Sex brings life.

04:10.240 --> 04:14.438
I've been building this sexhibition
since I was 11 and a quarter

04:14.760 --> 04:16.875
which is when I first climaxed

04:17.880 --> 04:19.870
by accident on a bidet.

04:20.880 --> 04:23.508
The bidet is, of course,
exhibited here as are

04:23.520 --> 04:26.159
all the pieces from my
first ever sexhibition.

04:27.200 --> 04:28.200
All apart from one.

04:28.880 --> 04:30.154
A few weeks ago

04:30.720 --> 04:34.839
one of my most delicate pieces
was stolen from my studio.

04:34.880 --> 04:35.995
CROWD GROANS

04:37.320 --> 04:39.072
But in a sense it was a blessing.

04:40.520 --> 04:42.760
In fact, her brutal
snatching made me think of

04:42.772 --> 04:45.071
all the women of the world
who have been robbed

04:45.680 --> 04:48.433
of their freedom, of their happiness

04:49.080 --> 04:51.037
and, in the saddest of
cases, of their bodies.

04:51.960 --> 04:54.429
So in many ways I have to thank the thief

04:54.840 --> 04:58.196
for creating my most profound
piece of work to date.

04:59.240 --> 05:00.240
A woman robbed.

05:01.800 --> 05:02.995
APPLAUSE

05:04.920 --> 05:08.276
Now I would ask you all to leave
your genitals at the door

05:08.320 --> 05:10.914
and bring your minds to these pieces.

05:11.200 --> 05:15.433
I don't believe people always think
about sex when they see a naked body

05:15.480 --> 05:18.359
I believe they think
about their own minds

05:18.720 --> 05:21.280
their own bodies and their own power.

05:22.400 --> 05:25.199
And that's what this show is really about.

05:26.120 --> 05:27.155
It's about power.

05:29.320 --> 05:30.320
Thank you.

05:30.640 --> 05:32.313
APPLAUSE

05:38.880 --> 05:40.314
Beautiful. Beautiful.

05:44.480 --> 05:46.869
Claire, it's me.
Just wondering where you are

05:46.920 --> 05:52.916
'cause I am very much here
and waiting for you. OK, bye.

05:54.280 --> 05:55.475
SHE SIGHS
- Damn it, Claire.

05:56.040 --> 05:58.400
Have you seen a sort of stressed
out version of me anywhere?

05:59.360 --> 06:01.510
Is it weird that my mouth's watering?

06:06.160 --> 06:09.232
It's really fantastic work,
honestly. It's amazing.

06:09.280 --> 06:10.600
Thank you so much.

06:11.960 --> 06:13.155
Yes, extraordinary.

06:13.800 --> 06:16.314
Really, really moving and present.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.360
I'd love one of these on my floor.

06:19.200 --> 06:20.315
Like a rug with perks.

06:21.760 --> 06:22.909
I'm sure you would

06:22.960 --> 06:25.270
but it's very securely nailed
to the wall this evening.

06:25.320 --> 06:26.469
THEY LAUGH

06:27.760 --> 06:29.000
Have you found your father yet?

06:29.160 --> 06:30.520
Oh yes, I think he's by the coats.

06:30.544 --> 06:33.297
Oh, no, no.
Have you found your father yet?

06:35.320 --> 06:37.118
It's just so very obvious to me.

06:47.760 --> 06:48.760
Yeah.

06:50.080 --> 06:52.196
Er... Oh, Connor.

06:52.640 --> 06:53.640
Oops.

06:56.640 --> 06:58.392
ARSEHOLE GUY:
Look, about this morning.

07:00.600 --> 07:02.320
God, listen, what I was trying to say is...

07:02.344 --> 07:03.414
Oh, here we go.

07:04.200 --> 07:08.353
I didn't realise this until we were
having sex earlier and I lost my...

07:08.400 --> 07:09.754
Erection.
- Erection.

07:09.800 --> 07:10.676
One more time.

07:10.720 --> 07:11.720
Erection.

07:13.880 --> 07:16.235
But it made me realise

07:16.960 --> 07:17.960
I'm in love.

07:19.960 --> 07:20.960
Oh...
- SHE LAUGHS

07:21.960 --> 07:23.633
OK. I mean,
I don't really know what to...

07:23.680 --> 07:26.035
And I don't want to
have sex with anyone else

07:26.600 --> 07:28.477
and that's never
happened to me before.

07:30.120 --> 07:31.120
SHE CHUCKLES

07:33.280 --> 07:34.280
HE EXHALES

07:34.640 --> 07:35.640
I'm in love.

07:37.920 --> 07:40.719
And I need to tell her.

07:42.920 --> 07:45.080
Her? - Yeah, we've been together
for a couple of months

07:45.120 --> 07:48.397
and physically she just
never satisfied me.

07:48.440 --> 07:53.355
She has these really
massive bouncy tits

07:53.400 --> 07:55.960
that really don't do anything for me
and you just kept turning up

07:55.984 --> 07:59.579
like this sexy plank

08:00.440 --> 08:01.953
and it confused me.

08:03.240 --> 08:05.960
I just don't think I should be
fucking around behind her back anymore

08:06.000 --> 08:09.277
but I just thought
that I should say that I am

08:09.560 --> 08:13.315
sorry if I have led you on.

08:14.640 --> 08:16.313
Oh. No.

08:17.200 --> 08:21.114
Oh God, no. My, um, my ex is
due back any day now anyway

08:21.160 --> 08:23.879
so that's, um... I'm happy for you.

08:26.440 --> 08:28.829
Yeah... I I knew you wouldn't give a shit.

08:28.880 --> 08:30.075
Yeah, well, what can I say?

08:30.120 --> 08:30.916
SHE LAUGHS

08:30.960 --> 08:33.839
I'm sorry. I don't give a shit.

08:40.440 --> 08:41.440
Cool.

08:45.080 --> 08:46.673
Never wear padding, OK?

08:55.240 --> 08:56.992
Claire, where are you?

08:57.040 --> 09:00.112
I can't survive much longer
in this sea of penises

09:00.160 --> 09:01.992
and I don't know anyone and so...

09:04.440 --> 09:05.440
Harry?

09:07.480 --> 09:08.480
Harry?

09:10.960 --> 09:11.960
Hi.

09:12.400 --> 09:13.400
Hi.

09:14.440 --> 09:15.874
What did she do to you?

09:16.720 --> 09:17.755
Well just, you know

09:17.800 --> 09:20.561
covered me in plaster and left me in
the garden for a couple of hours.

09:20.585 --> 09:21.585
SHE EXHALES

09:21.640 --> 09:24.712
Oh God, hi. Oh.
It's so good to see you.

09:25.320 --> 09:26.320
Oh.

09:27.720 --> 09:28.720
Hi.

09:29.080 --> 09:30.080
Hi.

09:32.280 --> 09:33.280
Hi.

09:34.560 --> 09:35.560
Hi.

09:35.640 --> 09:36.640
Um...

09:36.840 --> 09:38.353
I'm just gonna go and browse around.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.320
It was really nice to meet you.

09:40.360 --> 09:41.475
You too.

09:42.880 --> 09:45.269
That's Elaine.

09:45.320 --> 09:46.355
Hm.

09:46.400 --> 09:47.470
Hello darling.

09:49.336 --> 09:50.336
We're...

09:50.360 --> 09:53.000
Hey, did you see that really good
looking guy that <i>came</i> in with me?

09:53.024 --> 09:56.071
No, but I saw a really good looking
guy on his motorbike outside...

09:56.120 --> 09:56.837
Why?

09:56.880 --> 10:00.077
Oh, yeah, that's... he, um,
well he and I and...

10:00.120 --> 10:01.394
Oh, great.

10:01.440 --> 10:02.999
Yeah, he just dumped me, you know.

10:03.040 --> 10:05.873
Oh. Eh... um I'm sorry.

10:07.400 --> 10:09.710
This is very you.

10:10.000 --> 10:14.870
Yeah. Yeah... she, er, she said
you were cool with us doing... that.

10:23.440 --> 10:25.158
Yeah, I don't know why she... erm...

10:26.160 --> 10:27.559
where's my penis?

10:27.600 --> 10:28.880
Oh, it's on the wall over there.

10:29.280 --> 10:30.475
Second from the left.

10:35.280 --> 10:38.400
I should probably go and find Elaine.
She doesn't like being left on her own so

10:38.440 --> 10:40.113
You've still got some stuff at the flat.

10:42.200 --> 10:43.896
I've been rolling around
in my lingerie all over it

10:43.920 --> 10:45.480
waiting for you to come and collect it.

10:45.504 --> 10:46.230
Yeah, I...

10:46.280 --> 10:49.193
Just your, your Tupperware and
your TV and your dinosaur plate.

10:49.240 --> 10:50.833
Oh... I got a new dinosaur plate

10:50.880 --> 10:51.880
erm

10:52.760 --> 10:56.719
yeah... thank you.
But you can, you can keep those.

10:57.960 --> 10:58.960
Hey...

10:59.920 --> 11:01.593
do you still wank
about me sometimes?

11:04.240 --> 11:05.240
No.

11:15.360 --> 11:16.634
Elaine.

11:19.560 --> 11:20.755
Oop.
- HE LAUGHS

11:25.960 --> 11:28.600
Claire! My God, it's been hell.
Where have you been?

11:29.440 --> 11:30.510
. Erm.

11:34.360 --> 11:35.634
All parked up.

11:36.600 --> 11:37.600
Hello, you.

11:38.856 --> 11:39.856
Erm...

11:39.880 --> 11:41.359
We almost didn't make it but...

11:42.560 --> 11:44.437
We didn't wanna let the old boy down.

11:45.920 --> 11:49.160
But I thought that... - We're just gonna
do a quick whizz round to show our faces.

11:49.184 --> 11:50.354
OK I... but...

11:50.400 --> 11:52.000
We're just gonna do
a quick whizz around.

11:59.280 --> 12:02.600
Sorry, could you just... could you just do
something with those. Thank you, darling.

12:40.400 --> 12:41.674
SHE SNAPS HER FINGERS

12:47.840 --> 12:48.840
GLASS SMASH ES

12:54.480 --> 12:55.709
Don't!

12:58.320 --> 12:59.674
Don't!

13:00.320 --> 13:01.993
GLASS SMASH ES

GODMOTHER LAUGHS

13:05.080 --> 13:06.912
The joys of butterfingered staff.

13:07.200 --> 13:11.319
Stop making a spectacle of
yourself and clean that up.

13:12.280 --> 13:13.280
You clean that up.

13:16.640 --> 13:17.675
Apologise.

13:19.960 --> 13:21.189
I'm sorry.

13:23.200 --> 13:25.077
Turns out I'm not such
a natural after all.

13:29.440 --> 13:31.238
Oh, fuck off.

13:32.960 --> 13:34.280
I'm just going to say this once.

13:35.800 --> 13:37.632
I deserve to be happy.

13:38.480 --> 13:40.835
I am allowed to move on.

13:40.880 --> 13:42.757
I have a good life

13:42.800 --> 13:44.313
and I am happy, alright?

13:45.840 --> 13:46.875
Alright?

13:47.240 --> 13:53.873
If you don't mind, I'm going to
go and get my cardi from the car.

13:55.160 --> 13:56.639
It's a little chilly.

14:06.040 --> 14:07.872
I'm sorry you had to hear that

14:09.480 --> 14:11.198
but you did have to hear it.

14:12.160 --> 14:14.071
No, no. She'll do it.

14:25.120 --> 14:26.440
What the fuck was that?

14:26.880 --> 14:27.915
What is he doing here?

14:31.800 --> 14:33.029
You're not going to Finland?

14:35.800 --> 14:37.029
Oh God.

14:38.040 --> 14:39.269
What are you doing here?

14:39.320 --> 14:40.355
I'm helping.

14:41.080 --> 14:42.080
SHE CHUCKLES

14:42.680 --> 14:44.432
He is...
- He didn't try to kiss you.

14:45.120 --> 14:46.120
He did.

14:46.640 --> 14:48.440
He says it was more like
the other way around.

14:50.800 --> 14:51.800
What?

14:53.720 --> 14:55.233
But that's just not true.

14:55.880 --> 14:56.880
Huh.

14:57.640 --> 14:58.835
No, fuck you.

14:58.880 --> 15:00.359
Claire...
- Please don't.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.357
No, Claire, he came
out into the garden...

15:02.400 --> 15:03.595
I don't wanna hear it.

15:03.640 --> 15:04.880
Claire, you have to believe me.

15:04.904 --> 15:06.075
How can I believe you?

15:06.120 --> 15:07.440
Because I'm your sister.

15:07.480 --> 15:09.232
After what you did to Boo!

15:23.480 --> 15:25.517
He slept with someone else. He said...

15:26.240 --> 15:28.800
He told me he fucked someone else.

15:33.160 --> 15:37.597
I'm sorry but you just have to
see it from my point of view.

15:42.640 --> 15:43.640
Come on.

15:58.920 --> 16:00.479
I think I love him.

16:16.720 --> 16:19.030
I'm gonna hurt myself.
I'm gonna get hit by a bike.

16:19.080 --> 16:22.240
I'm gonna hurt my finger and then he's
gonna have to come and see me in hospital

16:22.264 --> 16:24.733
and be really sorry for what he did.

I don't know where you came from.

17:11.040 --> 17:12.951
What, you don't think we're the same?

17:13.000 --> 17:15.037
You've got the same lines
on your forehead as me.

17:17.319 --> 17:18.958
Thank you for fixating on them.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.194
And you're stubborn.

17:20.240 --> 17:21.240
Snap.

17:21.896 --> 17:22.896
And sad...

17:22.920 --> 17:24.194
Not born sad.

17:24.240 --> 17:25.240
Some people are.

17:25.280 --> 17:26.280
You weren't.

17:26.319 --> 17:28.152
No. I guess not.

17:34.840 --> 17:38.629
Jesus, why do daughters get to say
that they're fucked up by their fathers

17:38.680 --> 17:40.717
when it's so often
the other way round?

17:53.280 --> 17:54.873
Why do you do that to yourself?

17:56.720 --> 17:57.720
Looks cool.

18:01.160 --> 18:04.312
I think your mother would have admired
your little performance up there.

18:09.400 --> 18:10.629
Do you ever think about her?

18:12.880 --> 18:13.880
Yeah.

18:15.560 --> 18:17.119
Do you think about your friend?

18:19.040 --> 18:20.040
All the time.

18:20.400 --> 18:21.400
Well.

18:26.720 --> 18:27.790
I'm sorry.

18:44.360 --> 18:45.589
Think you should go.

19:10.760 --> 19:13.832
BOO: Hi, this is Boo.
I can't come to the phone right now

19:13.880 --> 19:17.157
but please leave me a messiagio
and I will get back to you.

I can't come to the phone right now

You OK?

BANK MANAGER:
Big night then?

20:31.640 --> 20:32.640
Hmm...

20:33.880 --> 20:34.880
What?

20:37.280 --> 20:40.910
I thought in the application for
your loan it said you ran a café

20:41.320 --> 20:42.674
for guinea pigs.

20:44.600 --> 20:46.273
That's why I thought it was funny. I...

20:47.440 --> 20:49.113
never thought guinea pigs needed...

20:49.160 --> 20:50.400
FLEABAG:
It's guinea pig themed.

20:51.816 --> 20:52.816
OK.
- Yeah.

20:52.840 --> 20:54.274
That makes sense.
- Yeah.

21:02.160 --> 21:04.310
Can I get you a cup of tea?

21:05.280 --> 21:06.280
Run out.

21:07.120 --> 21:08.120
BANK MANAGER:
Coffee?

21:09.600 --> 21:10.600
Run out.

21:15.520 --> 21:19.036
Well, I should probably be
heading back to the office.

21:22.840 --> 21:26.629
Cafés are a very difficult business.

21:28.080 --> 21:30.037
You certainly made this one very...

21:32.280 --> 21:33.280
. unique.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.752
I also fucked it into liquidation.

21:39.760 --> 21:40.760
OK.

21:42.520 --> 21:44.272
And I fucked up my family.

21:45.640 --> 21:46.914
Did you?

21:47.440 --> 21:50.114
And I fucked my friend
by fucking her boyfriend.

21:51.760 --> 21:52.760
Right.

21:54.600 --> 21:58.639
And sometimes I wish I didn't
even know that fucking existed

21:59.840 --> 22:01.672
and I know that my body, as it is now

22:01.720 --> 22:03.518
really is the only thing I have left

22:03.560 --> 22:06.871
and when that gets old and
unfuckable I may as well just kill it.

22:10.400 --> 22:12.357
And somehow there
isn't anything worse

22:13.480 --> 22:15.949
than someone who
doesn't want to fuck me.

22:17.720 --> 22:19.358
I fuck everything.

22:21.240 --> 22:23.797
Except for when I was in
your office, I really

22:23.809 --> 22:25.996
wasn't trying to,
that was an accident.

22:30.200 --> 22:34.273
Either everyone feels like this a little
bit and they're just not talking about it

22:35.240 --> 22:37.629
or I am completely fucking alone.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.593
Which isn't fucking funny.

22:52.280 --> 22:53.634
Right, well, er...

22:55.480 --> 22:57.517
I should probably, um...

23:00.040 --> 23:01.678
I should probably, um...

23:04.920 --> 23:06.069
I should probably...

23:40.120 --> 23:41.872
People make mistakes.

23:49.480 --> 23:51.676
That's why they put rubbers
on the ends of pencils.

23:53.880 --> 23:55.109
Is that a joke?

23:56.800 --> 23:57.800
I don't know.

24:01.880 --> 24:04.269
I think we should start
your interview again.

24:07.200 --> 24:08.200
Here?

24:08.720 --> 24:09.720
Yeah.

24:10.280 --> 24:11.280
Go on.

24:11.960 --> 24:12.960
OK.

24:14.320 --> 24:16.550
Well, thank you for coming in.

24:18.600 --> 24:19.635
No problem.

24:21.840 --> 24:24.559
I've read through your application form.

24:25.960 --> 24:28.873
Says you run a café for guinea pigs.

24:28.920 --> 24:30.274
SHE LAUGHS

24:31.400 --> 24:32.629
Told you it was funny.
