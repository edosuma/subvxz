00:33.832 --> 00:34.799
Hey, Boomhauer.

00:34.833 --> 00:35.822
How was Houston?

00:35.868 --> 00:38.359
Do anything, uh, interesting?

00:38.403 --> 00:40.371
Nah, you know, man,
stuff, you know.

00:40.405 --> 00:42.373
Usual ol' meetings,
you know, and stuff

00:42.407 --> 00:44.773
with conferences,
stuff like, you
know, uh, dang ol'...

00:44.810 --> 00:45.777
Liar!

00:45.811 --> 00:46.778
Show him, Hank.

00:46.812 --> 00:49.872
An official Houston
Texans bobblehead.

00:49.915 --> 00:50.882
If you're
going to sneak

00:50.916 --> 00:53.111
around behind
the Dallas Cowboys' backs

00:53.152 --> 00:56.121
you better not ask a Cowboy fan
to get your mail.

00:56.155 --> 00:58.487
You went to their training camp,
didn't you?

00:58.524 --> 01:01.652
You make me sick.

01:01.693 --> 01:02.660
Dang it,
Boomhauer

01:02.694 --> 01:03.854
just because the Cowboys

01:03.896 --> 01:06.626
have a bad season or two,
or five,

01:06.665 --> 01:11.193
doesn't give you the right
to abandon them, right, guys?

01:11.236 --> 01:14.000
Although I guess

01:14.039 --> 01:16.564
if we root for the Texans,
it doesn't mean

01:16.608 --> 01:19.975
we'd have to stop rooting
for the Cowboys.

01:20.012 --> 01:22.344
Well, they are
in different conferences

01:22.381 --> 01:23.848
so it would only be a problem

01:23.882 --> 01:26.248
if they played
in the Super Bowl.

01:26.285 --> 01:29.448
An all-Texas Super Bowl.

01:29.488 --> 01:32.013
His will be done.

01:32.057 --> 01:34.821
Peggy, where's that list
of ATMs in Houston?

01:34.860 --> 01:36.828
Me and the guys
are going to watch

01:36.862 --> 01:38.830
the Texans training camp
this weekend.

01:38.864 --> 01:39.831
This weekend?

01:39.865 --> 01:41.298
Hank, we have
reservations

01:41.333 --> 01:43.301
at That's Amore
Saturday night.

01:43.335 --> 01:44.632
I-I told you
about this.

01:44.670 --> 01:46.638
I booked the table
in the kitchen.

01:46.672 --> 01:47.639
The chef's table?

01:47.673 --> 01:48.640
You got in?!

01:48.674 --> 01:51.234
Oh, yeah, I sort of remember
you mentioning that.

01:51.276 --> 01:54.507
Hank, it took me two months
to get that table.

01:54.546 --> 01:57.572
I promoted an illiterate student
to the ninth grade

01:57.616 --> 02:00.176
just because his father
delivers meat to That's Amore.

02:00.219 --> 02:03.347
Sure, let's have dinner
in a restaurant's kitchen.

02:03.388 --> 02:05.356
Maybe we can have dessert
in the restroom.

02:05.390 --> 02:07.358
All right, Hank,
you are not understanding me.

02:07.392 --> 02:09.553
When I make plans,
I check with you first,

02:09.595 --> 02:11.085
but you... you
just go off

02:11.129 --> 02:13.597
and make whatever plans you want
without even consulting me.

02:13.632 --> 02:16.430
Fine, I'll consult you
on everything.

02:16.468 --> 02:18.527
Peggy, I'm going
to go get a glass of water.

02:18.570 --> 02:22.097
Oh, wait, Peggy, I'm walking
to the refrigerator first.

02:22.140 --> 02:24.108
Oh! Maybe
I should just take Bobby.

02:24.142 --> 02:25.109
(delighted squeal)

02:25.143 --> 02:26.110
Bobby,
I'm not taking you.

02:26.144 --> 02:30.604
I was just trying
to get back at your father.

02:30.649 --> 02:31.616
Oh.

02:31.650 --> 02:33.379
Uh, Peggy, I've
been thinking

02:33.418 --> 02:35.648
about what you
were saying

02:35.687 --> 02:38.781
and I realized you were
right to be mad at me,

02:38.824 --> 02:40.883
and I want to
make it up to you,

02:40.926 --> 02:42.621
so, uh...

02:42.661 --> 02:43.821
♪ Ta-da. ♪

02:43.862 --> 02:45.955
Guess who's coming to Houston
with us?

02:45.998 --> 02:47.966
And don't worry, I cleared it
with the guys.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.228
You're riding shotgun,

02:49.268 --> 02:51.236
and we don't have to share
a room with Bill.

02:51.270 --> 02:52.464
Oh, so, you've decided

02:52.504 --> 02:54.472
I am going to Houston
this weekend,

02:54.506 --> 02:56.474
and what team I'm going
to root for.

02:56.508 --> 02:58.476
Have you written a cheer
for me too, Hank?

02:58.510 --> 02:59.477
Uh... n-no.

02:59.511 --> 03:01.672
I cannot
believe you.

03:01.713 --> 03:03.681
I am not
one of your propane tanks

03:03.715 --> 03:04.773
you can just
order around

03:04.816 --> 03:06.784
who will obey
your every whim.

03:10.489 --> 03:11.581
Bobby,
it's your lucky day.

03:11.623 --> 03:13.591
Your father
has a new shirt for you.

03:13.625 --> 03:14.592
Really?

03:14.626 --> 03:15.593
No.

03:15.627 --> 03:18.425
Peggy won't let me
go to Houston.

03:18.463 --> 03:21.125
Are you two having problems?

03:21.166 --> 03:23.828
Irreconcilable
differences, maybe?

03:23.869 --> 03:24.836
As the only

03:24.870 --> 03:26.167
happily married
man out here

03:26.204 --> 03:30.265
may I suggest
marriage counseling
with Dr. Tim Rast?

03:30.309 --> 03:33.278
"Tim Rast will make
your marriage last."

03:33.312 --> 03:35.644
I came up with that slogan
during one of our sessions

03:35.681 --> 03:38.115
while Nancy was jabbering
about something.

03:38.150 --> 03:40.584
You're going
to couples therapy?

03:40.619 --> 03:42.348
Dang it, Dale,
how could you?

03:42.387 --> 03:45.288
Oh, he's great, Hank...
a real man's man.

03:45.324 --> 03:48.157
No matter what,
he always takes my side.

03:48.193 --> 03:50.991
He knows who signs
Nancy's name on his checks.

03:51.029 --> 03:53.589
Huh. So, all I have to do
is show up

03:53.632 --> 03:56.066
and he'll tell Peggy
I'm right and she's wrong?

03:56.101 --> 03:57.068
Y'uh-huh.

03:57.102 --> 04:00.970
Even when I say something
I know is crazy, he nods.

04:01.006 --> 04:03.531
Huh. Well, I guess
as long as he’s just there

04:03.575 --> 04:06.009
to tell Peggy she's wrong,
I can't see the harm.

04:06.044 --> 04:11.778
Uh, Peggy, I don't really know
how to say this,

04:11.817 --> 04:15.480
and yet there's no greeting card
for it, either.

04:15.520 --> 04:17.180
What?

04:17.221 --> 04:20.452
Well, uh, I think we should see

04:20.492 --> 04:25.225
a professional...
r-relationship person.

04:25.263 --> 04:26.389
(audible spitting)

04:26.431 --> 04:28.422
What? You mean
a marriage counselor?

04:28.467 --> 04:30.697
Like the one
Dale and Nancy use.

04:30.736 --> 04:32.260
Dr. Tim Rast.

04:32.304 --> 04:34.238
Yes, him.

04:34.272 --> 04:35.239
Please, Peggy.

04:35.273 --> 04:38.071
I just need
somewhere safe to go and, uh

04:38.110 --> 04:40.101
let it all hang out.

04:40.145 --> 04:43.205
Oh, Hank, don’t worry,
I'll handle everything.

04:43.248 --> 04:45.341
I'll call tomorrow to
make an appointment.

04:45.384 --> 04:47.545
I already did...
Friday at 4:30.

04:47.586 --> 04:49.611
Huh. So, you made
an appointment

04:49.654 --> 04:50.916
without consulting me.

04:50.956 --> 04:52.082
Well, at least we know

04:52.124 --> 04:53.386
the first thing
we'll discuss.

04:53.425 --> 04:55.893
Even his elbows

04:55.927 --> 04:58.327
are nicotine stained,
he refuses to acknowledge

04:58.363 --> 04:59.330
he's bald,

04:59.364 --> 05:02.595
and he sobs uncontrollably
after sex.

05:02.634 --> 05:05.660
Well, crying
can be a healthy release.

05:05.704 --> 05:07.262
Thank you, Doctor.

05:07.305 --> 05:09.535
Say, it's
that time again.

05:09.574 --> 05:10.768
But before you go,

05:10.809 --> 05:13.471
I want to draw something
for y'all to take home.

05:13.512 --> 05:15.036
This here's
a treasure map.

05:15.080 --> 05:16.047
Ah...

05:16.081 --> 05:18.379
Every time
you catch yourself thinking

05:18.417 --> 05:21.784
the key to happiness
is out there somewhere, Nancy,

05:21.820 --> 05:23.378
I want you
to look at this map,

05:23.422 --> 05:25.413
because it'll lead you
to a treasure

05:25.457 --> 05:26.981
that will bring the both of you

05:27.025 --> 05:29.516
untold riches
for the rest of your lives.

05:29.561 --> 05:30.528
Gimme!

05:30.562 --> 05:36.523
G'i!

05:39.571 --> 05:41.539
Dr. Rast
really is very good.

05:41.573 --> 05:46.067
Now, I have solved the family's
emotional crises up to now,

05:46.111 --> 05:48.978
so, I hope you do not mind
if I take my own notes.

05:49.014 --> 05:51.278
Mm-hmm.

05:51.316 --> 05:53.614
Mm-hmm-hmm.

05:53.652 --> 05:55.279
So, here's
the deal, Coach.

05:55.320 --> 05:57.254
She wants to go
to a restaurant

05:57.289 --> 05:58.881
and eat in
the kitchen.

05:58.924 --> 06:00.585
I know, I don't
get it, either.

06:00.625 --> 06:03.458
And I want to go
see the Texans train.

06:03.495 --> 06:05.087
I look forward
to your ruling.

06:05.130 --> 06:06.495
This is not
just about going

06:06.531 --> 06:07.498
to see the Texans.

06:07.532 --> 06:10.365
It is about the Chinese
cooking class we never took,

06:10.402 --> 06:12.461
the matching outfits
we never wore.

06:12.504 --> 06:14.938
Do you realize
we have no scented soaps

06:14.973 --> 06:16.338
anywhere in the house?

06:16.374 --> 06:18.342
Hank is always acting
like the boss.

06:18.376 --> 06:20.344
He won't even let me pay
the phone bill

06:20.378 --> 06:23.814
because he doesn't like
the way I make sevens.

06:23.849 --> 06:26.784
Hank, I want you
to go see the Texans,

06:26.818 --> 06:28.080
and forget
all about Peggy.

06:28.119 --> 06:33.785
See? Sounds pretty dang selfish
when you hear it out loud.

06:33.825 --> 06:36.521
Okay,
let's do Magic Wand.

06:36.561 --> 06:37.585
What's going on here?

06:37.629 --> 06:39.756
It's a relationship game, Hank.

06:39.798 --> 06:41.766
I got it
from Goldie Hawn's life coach

06:41.800 --> 06:42.767
at a conference in Reno.

06:42.801 --> 06:45.634
Oh, God, I've been misinformed.

06:45.670 --> 06:46.762
I need to get
out of here.

06:46.805 --> 06:48.796
Sit down, Hank.
This was your idea.

06:48.840 --> 06:50.364
I think
you'll like

06:50.408 --> 06:51.875
Magic Wand, Hank.

06:51.910 --> 06:52.877
Let's play.

06:52.911 --> 06:55.004
Now, you have
a magic wand.

06:55.046 --> 06:56.104
What's one thing

06:56.147 --> 06:58.843
you would like to change
about your partner?

06:58.884 --> 07:00.408
(sighing)

07:00.452 --> 07:04.286
Well, call me crazy, but
I wouldn't change anything.

07:04.322 --> 07:06.290
Well, that's
not the right answer.

07:06.324 --> 07:08.292
Give me the wand;
I'll do it right.

07:08.326 --> 07:10.294
Sounds like you two
have an issue with control.

07:10.328 --> 07:13.456
What I like to do is something
I call Time Machine Therapy,

07:13.498 --> 07:14.465
or T.M.T.

07:14.499 --> 07:15.466
(sighing)

07:15.500 --> 07:17.058
I am going to kill Dale.

07:17.102 --> 07:19.127
What I want you two to do

07:19.170 --> 07:21.365
is picture yourselves
in the future.

07:21.406 --> 07:24.739
You two are retired,
no work, no kids.

07:24.776 --> 07:26.744
Quick, where
do you picture yourself?

07:26.778 --> 07:28.678
We already have
that figured out.

07:28.713 --> 07:30.681
We're going to buy his
and hers motorcycles

07:30.715 --> 07:33.206
and see America,
excluding California.

07:33.251 --> 07:35.310
Mm-hmm.
Tell me more.

07:35.353 --> 07:37.253
What more is there?

07:37.289 --> 07:40.122
Freedom of the open road,
and such.

07:40.158 --> 07:42.217
All the maintenance
a guy could ask for.

07:42.260 --> 07:46.424
PEGGY:
Collecting spoons
from every state capitol.

07:46.464 --> 07:47.726
Meeting colorful characters

07:47.766 --> 07:51.327
like truck stop waitresses
and corrupt local sheriffs.

07:51.369 --> 07:53.963
We have set up a direct deposit
savings account,

07:54.005 --> 07:56.337
and are just over halfway
to our goal.

07:56.374 --> 07:58.842
More if our son Bobby
doesn’t go to college.

07:58.877 --> 08:00.845
I'm going to write you two
a prescription

08:00.879 --> 08:01.846
I think is going

08:01.880 --> 08:02.847
to help you
with your problem.

08:02.881 --> 08:03.870
Uh, Doctor,

08:03.915 --> 08:06.440
if you'll check
your notes,

08:06.484 --> 08:09.078
we only have half
the money saved.

08:09.120 --> 08:10.417
Mm-hmm. Here it is
right here.

08:10.455 --> 08:13.515
But half the money will still
buy you one motorcycle,

08:13.558 --> 08:16.026
and that would give you
something to share together

08:16.061 --> 08:17.892
as equal partners.

08:17.929 --> 08:19.897
'Course, if you don’t want
a motorcycle,

08:19.931 --> 08:22.399
there's other things
you could spend that money on.

08:22.434 --> 08:25.426
Like more counseling.

08:36.847 --> 08:38.371
Is that us?

08:38.416 --> 08:39.440
It is now.

08:39.484 --> 08:41.280
Hit it, Daddy!

08:41.318 --> 08:47.189
(engine revving)

09:07.412 --> 09:10.540
I can't believe
you guys bought a motorcycle.

09:10.582 --> 09:13.176
Evel Knievel had a Harley
and a cape

09:13.218 --> 09:15.345
and a jeweled walking stick.

09:15.387 --> 09:18.845
It was a cane, and it was
because he had a crushed pelvis.

09:18.890 --> 09:22.553
And a cape.

09:22.594 --> 09:24.585
Mmm. I'm having trouble
making this out

09:24.629 --> 09:26.153
through my own spit.

09:26.197 --> 09:28.358
What kind of idiot
uses 'delible ink

09:28.400 --> 09:32.097
to draw a treasure map?

09:32.137 --> 09:32.728
This looks about right.

09:32.771 --> 09:35.569
Start digging, Bill.

09:35.607 --> 09:37.234
Can I take the
blindfold off?

09:37.275 --> 09:39.266
I don’t want any
of your treasure.

09:39.310 --> 09:41.471
I just enjoy the time
we spend together.

09:41.513 --> 09:42.844
Me, too.

09:42.881 --> 09:45.281
That's why
I didn't gag you.

09:45.316 --> 09:46.340
No, Bill.

09:46.384 --> 09:48.352
I promise
I'll wipe my head first.

09:48.386 --> 09:49.785
No.

09:49.821 --> 09:51.482
We ride in five, Big H.

09:51.523 --> 09:53.423
I just have to leather up.

09:53.458 --> 09:55.790
Boy, we made the right move,
I tell you what.

09:55.827 --> 09:56.987
We didn't need therapy.

09:57.028 --> 09:58.859
We needed a motorcycle.

09:58.897 --> 10:00.865
Whenever we go
to the hardware store

10:00.899 --> 10:02.867
she gets to give me
a 20-minute hug,

10:02.901 --> 10:04.869
and I get to go
to the hardware store.

10:04.903 --> 10:08.805
God, that shorty helmet
looks hot on you.

10:08.840 --> 10:11.434
Hmm, well,
I'll keep it on.

10:11.476 --> 10:12.943
Kiss me as hard
as you want.

10:12.977 --> 10:14.205
Your stuff's cleared up, right?

10:14.245 --> 10:16.145
Mm-mmm...
Mmm...

10:16.181 --> 10:21.949
Wow, look
at those two, Hank.

10:21.986 --> 10:23.283
Real bikers.

10:23.321 --> 10:25.653
We're going to need some
real biker accessories

10:25.690 --> 10:27.658
if we're going to fit
in with this crowd.

10:27.692 --> 10:28.659
Check out this wallet.

10:28.693 --> 10:29.660
That's so it doesn't

10:29.694 --> 10:30.661
fall out
of your pants

10:30.695 --> 10:31.662
during a rumble.

10:31.696 --> 10:33.664
Could you add this
to our wedding registry?

10:33.698 --> 10:36.861
I can't remember if it's under
my name, Pepperoni Sue,

10:36.901 --> 10:38.766
or the groom's... Lumpy.

10:38.803 --> 10:40.270
Well, that explains
why you two

10:40.305 --> 10:43.399
are acting like a couple
of about-to-be newlyweds.

10:43.441 --> 10:45.136
Congratulations.

10:45.176 --> 10:47.542
Thanks. You're only
off by ten years.

10:47.579 --> 10:49.513
We're doing a
re-commitment ceremony.

10:49.547 --> 10:50.741
First time
we got married

10:50.782 --> 10:53.250
all I got was a pair
of assless pants

10:53.284 --> 10:54.945
and a bottle
of tequila.

10:54.986 --> 10:55.953
That bottle
and them pants

10:55.987 --> 10:58.285
got us through five
states in three days.

10:58.323 --> 11:00.086
Oh, what a honeymoon!

11:00.125 --> 11:02.355
Yeah, this country of ours
looks pretty darn good

11:02.393 --> 11:04.361
with your boots
up in the breeze.

11:04.395 --> 11:05.657
You said it, brother.

11:05.697 --> 11:06.721
And now,
me and the old lady

11:06.765 --> 11:09.427
are fixing to head
up to South Dakota
for the nuptials.

11:09.467 --> 11:11.298
Yup, Biker
Week in Sturgis,

11:11.336 --> 11:12.928
just like the
first time around.

11:12.971 --> 11:16.031
Yeah, tradition's
real important
to Lumpy and me.

11:16.074 --> 11:17.769
That's why we're going
to spend our wedding night

11:17.809 --> 11:20.573
under the same Foosball table

11:20.612 --> 11:22.375
in the same bar
as last time.

11:22.413 --> 11:24.506
Oh, hey, have you guys
ever been to Sturgis?

11:24.549 --> 11:25.641
Ah, it's a party.

11:25.683 --> 11:26.650
800,000 bikers,

11:26.684 --> 11:28.845
and Robbie Knievel's
jumping 13 dump trucks

11:28.887 --> 11:31.378
in the middle
of a Styx concert.

11:31.422 --> 11:33.219
Yeah, it's a solid week

11:33.258 --> 11:34.657
of free music,
dancing,

11:34.692 --> 11:36.125
and pickle-
licking contests.

11:36.161 --> 11:37.219
You should come.

11:37.262 --> 11:39.753
Well, it does sound
like it offers

11:39.798 --> 11:41.959
a lot of fun
couples activities.

11:42.000 --> 11:45.231
We have been talking
about doing a longer ride.

11:45.270 --> 11:47.761
Yeah! "Live to ride,
ride to live!"

11:47.806 --> 11:51.298
Pepperoni Sue, give them
an invitation to our reception.

11:51.342 --> 11:53.310
If you feel like
getting us something

11:53.344 --> 11:55.312
we're also registered
at the liquor store.

11:55.346 --> 11:57.211
HANK:
Hmm...

11:57.248 --> 11:58.272
Well, dude,
if we're going

11:58.316 --> 12:01.285
to be riding to Sturgis,
we will need some sunblock.

12:01.319 --> 12:02.286
I'm off to the store.

12:02.320 --> 12:05.881
Good thinking,
Motorcycle Mama.

12:05.924 --> 12:09.655
(engine roaring)

12:17.468 --> 12:22.337
"Live to ride and ride to live,"
you dumb cows!

12:27.579 --> 12:29.570
Hank, I may never sleep again.

12:29.614 --> 12:32.310
Driving this Harley was amazing!

12:32.350 --> 12:33.544
If I have bugs in my teeth,

12:33.585 --> 12:36.019
it is because
I could not stop smiling.

12:36.054 --> 12:37.419
I should probably floss.

12:37.455 --> 12:38.649
I'd ask you
to start it up,

12:38.690 --> 12:40.555
but it'd wake
up Bobby.

12:40.592 --> 12:41.559
Ah, who cares?

12:41.593 --> 12:43.322
He gets enough sleep.

12:43.361 --> 12:46.592
(engine roaring)

12:46.631 --> 12:48.223
(gasps)

12:48.266 --> 12:51.531
Move! It's mine!

12:51.569 --> 12:53.969
(gasps)

12:54.005 --> 12:55.597
(gasps)

12:55.640 --> 12:58.200
What is it?

12:58.243 --> 13:00.143
A mummified
house cat.

13:00.178 --> 13:03.341
It must have
belonged to
the pharaoh.

13:03.381 --> 13:04.609
Hmm.

13:04.649 --> 13:06.378
"Mr. Boots."

13:06.417 --> 13:09.011
But... that was your cat, Dale.

13:09.053 --> 13:10.315
Impossible.

13:10.355 --> 13:14.553
Mr. Boots was white and fluffy,
and feisty and fun-loving.

13:14.592 --> 13:17.891
This is just a skeleton.

13:17.929 --> 13:20.295
Wait a minute.

13:20.331 --> 13:22.356
Nancy told me that he ran away.

13:24.535 --> 13:25.502
Oh.

13:25.536 --> 13:26.503
Potato, potato,
potato, potato.

13:26.537 --> 13:27.970
Potato, potato
potato, potato.

13:28.006 --> 13:29.906
BOTH:
Potato, potato,
potato, potato...

13:29.941 --> 13:32.739
(quickly):
Potato, potato, potato...

13:32.777 --> 13:33.744
(laughs)

13:33.778 --> 13:34.745
Oh.

13:34.779 --> 13:37.771
(laughs)

13:37.815 --> 13:40.477
Now, you have a good time

13:40.518 --> 13:42.577
at your Grandpa Cotton's
while we're gone.

13:42.620 --> 13:43.587
Fine.

13:43.621 --> 13:45.418
But I'm not
taking a bath

13:45.456 --> 13:46.946
with that
baby again.

13:46.991 --> 13:47.958
It's humiliating.

13:47.992 --> 13:50.460
Okay, everyone,
step away from the vehicle

13:50.495 --> 13:53.157
so I can execute
a farewell donut.

13:53.197 --> 13:55.097
Oh, quit dragging it out.

13:55.133 --> 13:56.259
Just, go. Go!

13:56.301 --> 13:58.201
NANCY:
Ride that hog, girl.

13:58.236 --> 14:01.262
DALE:
Bye. Get me a shot glass.

14:01.306 --> 14:02.364
(cheering)

14:02.407 --> 14:04.773
Oh, you've been driving
all morning, Hank.

14:04.809 --> 14:07.073
Why don't you take a break?

14:07.111 --> 14:10.080
I can take over
for a while.

14:10.114 --> 14:11.081
Thanks, but I'm okay.

14:11.115 --> 14:13.083
Maybe next stop.

14:22.293 --> 14:24.352
Okay, Hank, Kansas is mine.

14:24.395 --> 14:26.625
I'm going
to tear this state a new one.

14:26.664 --> 14:29.428
Yeah, uh, maybe we ought
to switch off after Kansas.

14:29.467 --> 14:30.456
I wouldn’t want you to miss out

14:30.501 --> 14:34.232
on all that wheat.

14:35.707 --> 14:36.696
No.

14:36.741 --> 14:39.039
I'm still feeling
surprisingly fresh.

14:39.077 --> 14:42.444
Thanks, though.

14:43.781 --> 14:44.907
You know we're
almost there.

14:44.949 --> 14:46.610
Why mess with success.

14:46.651 --> 14:49.814
Smile!

14:53.691 --> 14:55.318
Come on,
Peggy, smile.

14:55.360 --> 14:57.954
I am sick
of you bossing me around.

14:57.996 --> 15:00.226
Let me drive,
then I will smile.

15:00.264 --> 15:02.425
Well, I explained
to you in Nebraska.

15:02.467 --> 15:05.402
It would throw our
weight distribution
all out of whack.

15:05.436 --> 15:07.427
Maybe the coroner could
take a photo of us

15:07.472 --> 15:09.440
after we bounced
off the asphalt

15:09.474 --> 15:10.702
like a couple
of rag dolls.

15:10.742 --> 15:12.437
Hank, that's bunk.

15:12.477 --> 15:13.535
I am driving.

15:13.578 --> 15:14.840
Uh...

15:14.879 --> 15:17.211
okay, but, see, Peggy,
the thing of it is,

15:17.248 --> 15:20.342
it just doesn’t work that
way with biker couples.

15:20.385 --> 15:23.183
Lumpy and Pepperoni Sue
have a great relationship,

15:23.221 --> 15:25.314
and she never
rides up front.

15:25.356 --> 15:26.380
In fact, the spot

15:26.424 --> 15:29.086
behind the driver
is called the...

15:29.127 --> 15:30.116
(sighs)

15:30.161 --> 15:31.685
The..."bitch" seat.

15:31.729 --> 15:32.696
What?!

15:32.730 --> 15:34.823
So, that makes me your...

15:34.866 --> 15:36.458
No, no. No!

15:36.501 --> 15:37.832
It's a motorcycle term.

15:37.869 --> 15:39.837
I don't even think
it's spelled the same.

15:39.871 --> 15:42.066
Forget I brought it up.

15:42.106 --> 15:43.368
My God!

15:43.408 --> 15:45.376
Maybe we should have
taken the therapy.

15:45.410 --> 15:47.378
Hey, let's stop
at a souvenir stand

15:47.412 --> 15:49.380
so I can get a T-shirt
that says

15:49.414 --> 15:51.382
"My husband controlled
my vacation,

15:51.416 --> 15:53.680
and all I got
was this lousy T-shirt."

15:53.718 --> 15:56.482
That would be a nice picture
to show Dr. Rast, huh?

15:56.521 --> 15:58.489
Well, maybe we should
get a motorcycle

15:58.523 --> 16:00.491
with a seat big enough
for three people.

16:00.525 --> 16:02.186
Then Dr. Rast
could ride along

16:02.226 --> 16:03.693
and analyze our marriage.

16:03.728 --> 16:05.286
Good idea.

16:05.329 --> 16:06.296
Now, hold on.

16:06.330 --> 16:07.297
We're going.

16:07.331 --> 16:08.958
We are not going anywhere.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.696
Oh, yes, we are.

16:33.324 --> 16:34.882
MAN:
Yahoo!

16:34.926 --> 16:37.861
Show us what
you got, girls!

16:37.895 --> 16:39.419
Oh!

16:39.464 --> 16:41.056
Oh.

16:41.099 --> 16:42.430
That's right, Hank.

16:42.467 --> 16:43.491
Get a good look.

16:43.534 --> 16:44.899
Because at the rate
you're going,

16:44.936 --> 16:47.370
you will not be seeing mine
anytime soon.

16:47.405 --> 16:48.997
Nice to see
that you've gotten vulgar

16:49.040 --> 16:52.567
as well as selfish.

16:52.610 --> 16:54.771
Peggy, release
the brake lever.

16:54.812 --> 16:55.779
Nuh-uh.

16:55.813 --> 16:56.780
This brake lever's on my side,

16:56.814 --> 16:58.975
and I will hold it down
as long as I want.

16:59.016 --> 17:00.984
Fine. We'll just
park the bike here.

17:01.018 --> 17:02.383
It doesn't bother me.

17:02.420 --> 17:05.388
I can watch the
motorized bar stool races.

17:05.423 --> 17:06.390
You know what?

17:06.424 --> 17:08.392
I am going
to the Greyhound station

17:08.425 --> 17:10.690
to buy myself a ticket
to Arlen.

17:10.728 --> 17:12.491
I'm sure the will let me sit

17:12.530 --> 17:14.156
anywhere I want
on the bus.

17:14.198 --> 17:16.598
You can't sit
in the bus driver's seat.

17:16.634 --> 17:17.896
You can't even talk to him.

17:17.935 --> 17:18.902
Ho-yeah!

17:18.935 --> 17:19.903
Baah!

17:19.936 --> 17:21.962
Oh, will you quit

17:22.006 --> 17:23.769
your whining, you old woman?

17:23.808 --> 17:24.775
I'm wearing a bra.

17:24.809 --> 17:30.714
Barstool coming through!

17:36.187 --> 17:39.953
Ugh.

17:39.991 --> 17:44.360
Uh, oops.

17:44.395 --> 17:45.692
Oh, excuse me, officer.

17:45.730 --> 17:49.496
RAST:
But before you go,

17:49.534 --> 17:53.334
this map will lead you
to a treasure that'll...

17:53.371 --> 17:54.702
Ha!

17:54.739 --> 17:55.728
I'm rich.

17:55.773 --> 17:56.933
And you,

17:56.974 --> 17:58.134
stop playing
the blame game.

17:58.176 --> 18:01.270
Ha-ha!

18:07.218 --> 18:09.186
Are these fixable?
No.

18:09.220 --> 18:10.517
PEPPERONI SUE:
How do you tell
what size you are

18:10.555 --> 18:12.216
in a nipple ring?

18:12.256 --> 18:13.746
Pepperoni Sue?

18:13.791 --> 18:14.553
Huh?

18:14.592 --> 18:15.616
Who's asking?

18:15.660 --> 18:17.992
Oh, it's that old biker dude
with the crazy girlfriend.

18:18.029 --> 18:19.018
Oh, yeah, yeah.

18:19.063 --> 18:21.429
Sorry I almost
messed you up, man.

18:21.465 --> 18:22.432
Wedding day jitters.

18:22.466 --> 18:25.526
Look at the kick-ass skull ring
Lumpy's getting me.

18:25.570 --> 18:27.231
Huh, a smiley one.

18:27.271 --> 18:28.169
(chuckles)

18:28.206 --> 18:30.936
Yeah, 'cause I know
how to make him smile.

18:30.975 --> 18:31.942
Mmm.

18:31.976 --> 18:32.943
Whoo-hoo!

18:32.977 --> 18:34.467
(man kissing loudly)

18:34.512 --> 18:36.480
SUE:
Oh, man, that's
good barbecue.

18:36.514 --> 18:39.142
So, how are you and your old
lady digging Biker Week?

18:39.183 --> 18:41.879
Uh, Peggy and I aren't speaking
right now.

18:41.919 --> 18:45.286
She's upset because I wouldn't
let her drive us.

18:45.323 --> 18:46.347
Hell, I'd rather
get shanked

18:46.390 --> 18:47.823
than let my
old lady drive.

18:47.858 --> 18:49.189
And I'd never ask.

18:49.227 --> 18:50.421
That's why our marriage works.

18:50.461 --> 18:51.428
Boundaries.

18:51.462 --> 18:53.293
Yeah. Who knows
her place?

18:53.331 --> 18:55.299
I do, baby.
Who knows her
place, huh?

18:55.333 --> 18:57.301
I do, baby.
Who knows
her place?

18:57.335 --> 18:58.302
I do, baby.

18:58.336 --> 18:59.303
Who knows
her place, huh?

18:59.337 --> 19:00.304
You okay?

19:00.338 --> 19:03.364
You look
like you licked a bad pickle.

19:03.407 --> 19:05.136
Pepperoni, show
him your girls.

19:05.176 --> 19:08.634
Okay, but they're a little
chapped from the ride.

19:08.679 --> 19:11.739
Uh, that's okay. Thanks.

19:18.222 --> 19:19.712
Where are your
glasses, Hank?

19:19.757 --> 19:21.486
Oh, did you decide
it's effeminate

19:21.525 --> 19:22.924
for a man to wear them?

19:22.960 --> 19:27.454
If so, I refer you
to Mr. Larry Hagman.

19:27.632 --> 19:29.623
A barstool ran into me
and broke my glasses.

19:29.667 --> 19:31.225
So, just take the bike,
and I'll take the bus.

19:31.269 --> 19:33.703
Hank, this is crazy.

19:33.738 --> 19:35.603
Now, get on.

19:35.640 --> 19:37.073
I will drive.

19:37.108 --> 19:39.872
But that would mean
I have to ride on the...

19:39.910 --> 19:42.003
other part of the seat.

19:42.046 --> 19:43.308
You know, behind.

19:43.347 --> 19:45.247
Oh, stop acting like a baby
and get on.

19:45.283 --> 19:48.980
I am not a baby.

20:10.908 --> 20:12.842
(shouting over engine):
Are your arms getting stiff
up there?

20:12.877 --> 20:14.003
A little.

20:14.045 --> 20:14.841
I suppose maybe

20:14.879 --> 20:19.316
I could put 'em down
here a little while.

20:23.788 --> 20:25.653
Dead snake!

20:26.157 --> 20:29.149
Nice evasive
maneuver, Peggy.

20:34.332 --> 20:38.894
Hank, there's a moose
drinking from that lake.

20:38.936 --> 20:40.494
There's a moose?

20:40.538 --> 20:41.732
And a lake?

20:41.772 --> 20:43.330
How big are
the antlers?

20:43.374 --> 20:45.035
Oh, my goodness, they're huge.

20:45.076 --> 20:48.204
Don't worry.
I'll get us closer.

20:57.154 --> 20:58.416
Hey, I see it.

20:58.456 --> 21:00.151
I see it.
It's beautiful.

21:00.191 --> 21:03.092
Yes, it is, Hank.

21:03.127 --> 21:04.651
I love you, Peggy!

21:04.695 --> 21:06.026
Sandwich?

21:06.063 --> 21:09.555
I think there's one left
in that saddlebag.
