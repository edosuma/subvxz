00:00.600 --> 00:02.419
Previously on For the People.

00:02.420 --> 00:04.139
This is your home. Your kitchen.

00:04.140 --> 00:06.589
- Food.
- Not that, that Zack's.

00:06.614 --> 00:08.815
Your listing said.

00:08.849 --> 00:10.650
"Onebedroom apartment,"

00:10.685 --> 00:11.718
nothing about sharing.

00:12.787 --> 00:14.531
My mother came by for lunch
and wanted to say hi.

00:14.555 --> 00:16.556
I hope my son is doing
an adequate job for you,

00:16.590 --> 00:18.658
but if he's not,
promise you'll never show him

00:18.693 --> 00:20.627
any special favor just because of me.

00:20.661 --> 00:23.083
Deal. If anything, I'll make it
even harder on him. How about that?

00:23.107 --> 00:25.378
Prison isn't the answer for everything.
Have some compassion.

00:25.402 --> 00:27.467
I have compassion for people
who follow the rules.

00:27.501 --> 00:28.435
Did you ever break a rule?

00:28.469 --> 00:30.213
For which you didn't pay
the appropriate price?

00:30.237 --> 00:31.171
Has that ever happened?

00:31.205 --> 00:32.505
You could be a good lawyer.

00:32.540 --> 00:34.708
What did I get? You
said, on the first day,

00:34.742 --> 00:35.675
"Get something."

00:35.710 --> 00:36.743
You got beat.

00:36.777 --> 00:38.545
And now you got to get up.

01:49.417 --> 01:50.583
Dani Rios.

01:50.618 --> 01:51.551
Dani Rios.

01:51.585 --> 01:54.487
26, exmilitary,
now a government contractor

01:54.522 --> 01:56.890
working for the NSA
in intelligence analysis.

01:56.924 --> 01:57.824
You see where this is going?

01:57.858 --> 01:59.659
- She's a whistleblower...
- She's a thief...

01:59.693 --> 02:01.271
who allegedly leaked
documents revealing

02:01.295 --> 02:03.596
that the NSA has been illegally accessing

02:03.631 --> 02:05.265
confidential medical databases

02:05.299 --> 02:07.667
in order to identify
undocumented Americans.

02:07.701 --> 02:10.270
Who stole highlyclassified
government files

02:10.304 --> 02:12.839
jeopardizing an important
national security initiative.

02:12.873 --> 02:14.941
She sent the documents
to a fringe leftwing website.

02:14.975 --> 02:16.409
The mainstream media.

02:16.444 --> 02:17.954
- The documents haven't been published.
- Yet.

02:17.978 --> 02:20.113
But there are rumors
of the programs existence.

02:20.147 --> 02:21.681
If I were to guess... I am certain...

02:21.715 --> 02:23.516
- Dani is an idealist...
- a punk...

02:23.551 --> 02:24.828
- wellintentioned...
- sanctimonious...

02:24.852 --> 02:26.096
- misguided...
- entitled...

02:26.120 --> 02:28.154
- in over her...
- swollen head.

02:28.189 --> 02:30.623
I'm giving this case to you, Sandra,

02:30.658 --> 02:32.135
because I think you can
connect with her...

02:32.159 --> 02:33.793
I'm giving this case to you, Littlejohn,

02:33.828 --> 02:34.794
because I know you'll want
to crush her...

02:34.829 --> 02:36.996
because you understand
the rule breakers.

02:37.031 --> 02:38.275
Because you believe
in the rule of law.

02:38.299 --> 02:40.099
- Do your best.
- Win.

02:44.338 --> 02:45.705
Taj Mahal?

02:45.739 --> 02:47.240
No.

02:49.343 --> 02:51.644
Do you know how long it took me
to get here on the train?

02:51.679 --> 02:52.679
You took the train?

02:52.713 --> 02:53.813
45 minutes.

02:53.848 --> 02:55.515
It takes 45 minutes.

02:55.549 --> 02:56.816
You're nervous, aren't you?

02:56.851 --> 02:58.017
It's my first sentencing.

02:58.052 --> 02:59.452
Well, you're gonna do great.

02:59.487 --> 03:01.855
Is this your new case?

03:01.889 --> 03:03.189
Okay, now I'm nervous.

03:03.224 --> 03:04.367
I've read your sentencing brief.

03:04.391 --> 03:05.458
It's superb.

03:05.493 --> 03:06.626
YYou always do this.

03:06.660 --> 03:08.228
Not that. This.

03:08.262 --> 03:10.230
You're up against Kate Littlejohn.

03:10.264 --> 03:11.865
- So what?
- Not so what.

03:11.899 --> 03:14.767
Talk to Jay. Definitely not "so what."

03:16.170 --> 03:17.403
Hey.

03:17.438 --> 03:19.672
- I'm busy.
- I thought you'd like to know

03:19.707 --> 03:21.708
that things are getting better
with me and Ezra.

03:23.077 --> 03:24.310
My Airbnb roommate.

03:24.345 --> 03:26.813
We worked out this...
shower schedule.

03:26.847 --> 03:29.025
As long as I'm in by 5:00, I can
stay in there as long as I want...

03:29.049 --> 03:30.717
literally as long as I want.

03:30.751 --> 03:32.385
I negotiated that.

03:32.419 --> 03:33.686
So... that's pretty cool.

03:33.721 --> 03:34.854
Do you need something?

03:34.889 --> 03:37.257
Just wanted to say "hi," good morning.

03:37.291 --> 03:38.224
I'm glad you showered.

03:38.259 --> 03:40.426
I just have this new case,
and it's a lot.

03:40.461 --> 03:42.362
This partner in my old law firm
once told me

03:42.396 --> 03:44.063
the first thing you do
when you get a case

03:44.098 --> 03:46.866
is find out who opposing counsel is.

03:46.901 --> 03:48.902
Most of the time, it's some deadbeat,

03:48.936 --> 03:50.413
and then you feel better about yourself.

03:50.437 --> 03:54.774
Opposing counsel is Sandra Bell.

03:54.808 --> 03:57.777
So that partner's advice
was pretty bad all around.

04:26.073 --> 04:27.951
You're gonna tell the judge
my uncle gave me that gun

04:27.975 --> 04:29.909
after our apartment
got broken into twice?

04:29.944 --> 04:31.711
Yes. Everything is in our papers.

04:31.745 --> 04:34.524
And those kids who stopped me and
little brother that day are in a gang.

04:34.548 --> 04:36.293
I bought the gun just
to get them to back off.

04:36.317 --> 04:39.752
I would never hurt anyone,
but I got to protect Donovan.

04:39.787 --> 04:40.887
We've only got each other.

04:40.921 --> 04:42.021
I know, Keenan. I know.

04:42.056 --> 04:44.657
But you did plead guilty
to possession of a firearm.

04:44.692 --> 04:46.893
We have to be prepared
for some jail time.

04:46.927 --> 04:48.895
If I go away for too long,

04:48.929 --> 04:50.897
I don't know what'll happen
to my mom and Donovan.

04:50.931 --> 04:54.000
- I take care of them.
- Judge Barish will factor all of this

04:54.034 --> 04:56.135
into her sentencing determination.

04:56.170 --> 04:57.737
She's reasonable.

05:00.507 --> 05:02.942
I've reviewed the presentence report,

05:02.977 --> 05:04.611
and I have both of your briefs.

05:04.645 --> 05:06.646
I'm prepared to impose my sentence.

05:06.680 --> 05:08.681
I do want to inform you
that I'll be utilizing

05:08.716 --> 05:11.684
the GreeneHaot riskassessment
software, EVALUATE,

05:11.719 --> 05:13.530
to assist in determining
the appropriate sentence.

05:13.554 --> 05:14.610
Software?

05:14.644 --> 05:16.823
An algorithm that makes a determination

05:16.857 --> 05:19.092
about the defendant's
potential recidivism.

05:19.126 --> 05:23.029
Many courts across the country
are already utilizing this tool.

05:23.063 --> 05:24.364
I'm sorry, Your Honor.

05:24.398 --> 05:26.032
Can the court educate counsel

05:26.066 --> 05:28.501
on what factors go into this algorithm?

05:28.535 --> 05:30.003
There are a lot of factors,

05:30.037 --> 05:32.271
but the exact formula is proprietary.

05:32.306 --> 05:35.141
What we do know is that
this technology promises

05:35.175 --> 05:38.645
to bring uniformity and fairness
and scientific discipline

05:38.679 --> 05:40.513
to an area of law that has always been

05:40.547 --> 05:41.881
arbitrary and capricious.

05:41.915 --> 05:43.549
This is a good thing, Ms. Adams.

05:43.584 --> 05:45.885
You're asking my client
to simply have faith

05:45.919 --> 05:47.654
that this program is fair?

05:47.688 --> 05:50.990
I am not <i>asking</i> you
or your client anything.

05:51.025 --> 05:54.560
I am <i>telling</i> you how I plan
on determining this sentence.

05:54.595 --> 05:57.063
If you need faith in something,

05:57.097 --> 05:59.732
have faith that I've been
a federal judge for 17 years

05:59.767 --> 06:01.034
and I know what I'm doing.

06:01.068 --> 06:02.902
Respectfully, Your Honor,

06:02.936 --> 06:05.238
I'd like the opportunity
to address the court

06:05.272 --> 06:07.040
on the software before sentencing.

06:07.074 --> 06:09.876
I'll give you one week
to prepare an argument.

06:09.910 --> 06:11.644
We're in recess.

06:14.028 --> 06:16.716
You went up against
Kate Littlejohn, right?

06:16.750 --> 06:18.751
Why would you say that name
in this office?

06:18.786 --> 06:20.019
This is a safe space.

06:20.054 --> 06:22.021
What's the problem with her?

06:22.056 --> 06:23.433
You ever go to a movie
and there are, like,

06:23.457 --> 06:25.091
two people talking right behind you

06:25.125 --> 06:26.503
and they're ruining your movie
and you're like,

06:26.527 --> 06:27.927
"I really want to say something,

06:27.961 --> 06:30.229
but I'm scared
they're gonna dogpile me"?

06:30.264 --> 06:32.899
And then some other person
just says, "Hey, shut up!"

06:32.933 --> 06:34.767
And the people talking shut up,

06:34.802 --> 06:36.246
and you're really grateful
for that person

06:36.270 --> 06:37.580
and wondering why you were so wimpy,

06:37.604 --> 06:39.038
but then you start worrying

06:39.073 --> 06:40.540
that person who told them to shut up

06:40.574 --> 06:42.375
is now gonna yell at you about something,

06:42.409 --> 06:43.710
and you realize <i>that</i> person

06:43.744 --> 06:45.545
is the person that really scares you?

06:45.579 --> 06:46.879
That's Kate Littlejohn.

06:46.914 --> 06:48.748
She's intense and uncompromising,

06:48.782 --> 06:52.185
and she instills in you
an incalculable fear...

06:52.219 --> 06:53.855
and dread.

06:55.663 --> 06:58.791
I think you might not have
the same issues I did, though.

07:00.494 --> 07:02.462
You went up against Sandra Bell, right?

07:02.496 --> 07:04.130
And won. Why?

07:04.164 --> 07:06.032
She's opposing counsel on my next case.

07:06.066 --> 07:08.445
Did you get the leaker case? Don't
tell me you got the leaker case.

07:08.469 --> 07:10.038
O... kay.

07:11.071 --> 07:12.115
Did you get the leaker case?

07:12.139 --> 07:13.039
Yes.

07:13.073 --> 07:15.074
If it was anybody but you,
I'd be annoyed.

07:15.109 --> 07:16.300
- You're annoyed.
- Superannoyed.

07:16.324 --> 07:17.987
Roger's punishing me
for bringing my mom here.

07:18.011 --> 07:19.779
Tell me about Sandra.

07:19.813 --> 07:22.148
She's selfrighteous,
passionate, in your face.

07:22.182 --> 07:23.827
I don't like her. I don't
like what she represents.

07:23.851 --> 07:25.795
I don't like who she represents,
and if I ever got arrested,

07:25.819 --> 07:28.454
she'd probably be
the first person I'd call.

07:28.489 --> 07:31.624
I can cancel my date tonight
and work on this with you.

07:31.658 --> 07:33.292
I don't want you to cancel your date.

07:33.327 --> 07:34.460
You sure?

07:34.495 --> 07:35.962
Yes.

07:35.996 --> 07:38.233
I'll be thinking about you
the whole time.

07:40.100 --> 07:42.068
Highprofile case, Kate Littlejohn.

07:42.102 --> 07:43.580
The press is gonna have
a field day with this.

07:43.604 --> 07:47.033
It's important. It's not high profile.

07:49.777 --> 07:51.744
You know what they're doing, right?

07:51.779 --> 07:53.813
They're accessing hospital databases

07:53.847 --> 07:55.448
without patients' permission.

07:55.482 --> 07:58.151
They say it is an antiterror program,

07:58.185 --> 08:00.153
aa way to find people
who are off the grid,

08:00.187 --> 08:02.421
but they're not using it
to find terrorists.

08:02.456 --> 08:04.457
They're using it to deport people,

08:04.491 --> 08:06.325
regular people,

08:06.360 --> 08:08.795
people who were brave enough
and hopeful enough

08:08.829 --> 08:10.630
to leave everything they knew
and come here.

08:10.664 --> 08:13.499
I was trying to do the right thing.

08:13.534 --> 08:14.667
I know you were.

08:14.701 --> 08:17.136
But it may have been the
right thing at the wrong time.

08:17.171 --> 08:19.839
The government is aggressively
prosecuting leakers right now.

08:19.873 --> 08:21.174
They're gonna try to punish you.

08:21.208 --> 08:23.109
I believe our best chance
is gonna be to try

08:23.143 --> 08:25.278
to negotiate with the government
for a deal.

08:25.312 --> 08:27.647
You face decades in prison
if you get convicted at trial.

08:27.681 --> 08:30.116
A deal, I might be able
to get it down to five years.

08:30.150 --> 08:32.852
I never thought I'd end up in here.

08:32.885 --> 08:34.120
In jail? Me?

08:34.154 --> 08:35.822
Two tours in Iraq,

08:35.856 --> 08:37.823
and now I'm an enemy of the state,

08:37.857 --> 08:39.586
all over the news.

08:40.193 --> 08:42.160
You're not all over the news.

08:43.697 --> 08:45.364
We never sent out a press release.

08:45.399 --> 08:46.966
'Cause we didn't want any press.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.502
Isn't the point of prosecuting
a leaker to send a message?

08:49.536 --> 08:51.070
No, the point of prosecuting a leaker

08:51.104 --> 08:53.206
is to stop the leaking
of classified information.

08:53.240 --> 08:56.052
The more we talk about it, the greater
the risk that information gets out.

08:56.076 --> 08:57.253
Well, I think it was a mistake.

08:57.277 --> 08:59.679
Burying this makes it look like
we're hiding something.

08:59.713 --> 09:00.746
We are.

09:00.781 --> 09:03.082
Well, if I was on the other side,

09:03.116 --> 09:04.550
I'd do something with that.

09:05.610 --> 09:07.353
They never issued a press release.

09:07.387 --> 09:09.021
Because they didn't want any press.

09:09.056 --> 09:10.423
- Why?
- My guess?

09:10.457 --> 09:12.258
Dani's a highly sympathetic defendant.

09:12.292 --> 09:14.760
If her story gets out,
people will be mad,

09:14.795 --> 09:15.872
and then they'll be more interested

09:15.896 --> 09:18.064
in the very thing the government
was trying to protect.

09:18.098 --> 09:19.509
That puts pressure on the government

09:19.533 --> 09:21.033
to reveal more about what happened.

09:21.068 --> 09:23.502
To drop or at least reduce
the charges against Dani.

09:23.537 --> 09:25.571
You're gonna do this, aren't you?

09:25.606 --> 09:27.342
Unless you tell me not to.

09:28.242 --> 09:31.410
24 hours ago,
the FBI arrested a young woman

09:31.445 --> 09:32.912
for telling the truth,

09:32.946 --> 09:35.081
that in the false name of antiterrorism,

09:35.115 --> 09:37.884
the United States government
has been illegally accessing

09:37.918 --> 09:41.020
the confidential medical records
of millions of Americans

09:41.054 --> 09:44.624
in order to identify and deport
undocumented immigrants.

09:44.658 --> 09:47.426
<i>The government tried
to keep this program a secret,</i>

09:47.461 --> 09:50.263
<i>and now it's trying
to keep this arrest a secret,</i>

09:50.297 --> 09:51.464
<i>but this is America.</i>

09:51.498 --> 09:53.366
<i>My client's name is Dani Rios.</i>

09:53.400 --> 09:56.068
<i>She's a hero. Not a criminal.</i>

10:16.277 --> 10:17.611
Damn.

10:17.645 --> 10:19.713
Damn!

10:19.747 --> 10:21.381
You broke my brain.

10:21.416 --> 10:23.584
You literally broke my brain.

10:28.990 --> 10:30.824
Gotta go. Find my clothes.

10:30.859 --> 10:32.693
Everything okay?

10:32.727 --> 10:35.529
Work stuff. I have to be in Brooklyn.

10:35.563 --> 10:38.632
- Why?
- Because it's where I work, Brooklyn.

10:38.666 --> 10:41.631
- Yeah, what's the case?
- Can't say.

10:41.665 --> 10:43.604
I'm Southern District, you're Eastern.

10:43.638 --> 10:46.406
- We're family.
- That's messed up.

10:46.441 --> 10:47.474
You broke my brain.

10:49.143 --> 10:50.978
Bart McKenna.

10:51.012 --> 10:52.579
<i>The</i> Bart McKenna?

10:52.614 --> 10:55.749
$100 million Ponzischeme Bart McKenna?

10:55.783 --> 10:57.584
Saw the story broke yesterday.

10:57.619 --> 10:59.563
Yeah, we were scrambling to
make a case, and then he ran.

10:59.587 --> 11:01.455
Slipped town last night on a cruise ship,

11:01.489 --> 11:03.634
except his ship stalled in
the middle of the Hudson River.

11:03.658 --> 11:05.302
And as soon as we can get it
towed to Brooklyn,

11:05.326 --> 11:07.261
I'll be waiting there with the FBI.

11:07.295 --> 11:09.563
Which is why I have to go to Brooklyn.

11:09.597 --> 11:11.765
Congratulations. That's huge.

11:13.768 --> 11:15.068
This is our secret.

11:15.103 --> 11:16.637
Which part?

11:16.671 --> 11:18.605
All of it.

11:24.846 --> 11:27.295
Bart McKenna's on a boat.

11:28.149 --> 11:30.617
Is this that game where
I add a sentence to yours

11:30.652 --> 11:32.252
- and we make a story?
- The Ponzi guy...

11:32.287 --> 11:33.998
He's stuck on a cruise ship
in the middle of the Hudson.

11:34.022 --> 11:35.266
Eastern is trying to make that case.

11:35.290 --> 11:36.490
Yes, but they haven't yet.

11:36.524 --> 11:38.736
And he's incorporated in Manhattan.
Several of his victims are here,

11:38.760 --> 11:40.861
so if I get that boat to dock
in Manhattan,

11:40.895 --> 11:42.596
we can claim venue as much as they can.

11:42.630 --> 11:43.674
You're trying to steal this case?

11:43.698 --> 11:45.265
Trying to get off the bench,

11:45.300 --> 11:47.334
get you a win, get myself a game ball.

11:47.368 --> 11:48.936
I hate sports metaphors.

11:48.970 --> 11:50.114
But I like what you're saying.

11:50.138 --> 11:51.282
You want me to go after this?

11:51.306 --> 11:52.706
- Yes.
- Great.

11:52.740 --> 11:55.619
If you steal a case for the Southern,
that's good for me, and if you blow this,

11:55.643 --> 11:57.388
then I can feel less guilty
about making you pay

11:57.412 --> 11:58.822
for parading your mom through my office.

11:58.846 --> 11:59.980
Winwin.

12:02.584 --> 12:03.748
You wanted to see me.

12:03.783 --> 12:05.296
You need to respond
to that press conference.

12:05.320 --> 12:06.720
I thought we didn't want press.

12:06.754 --> 12:08.622
We didn't want press,
but now there's press,

12:08.656 --> 12:10.467
and it's not the press we want,
so you need to respond.

12:10.491 --> 12:11.625
I think that's a mistake.

12:11.659 --> 12:13.404
Didn't you think it was a
mistake not to go to the press?

12:13.428 --> 12:14.861
Before she made a move, yes.

12:14.896 --> 12:17.130
But now she's a made a move, a big one...

12:17.165 --> 12:18.298
outside the lines.

12:18.333 --> 12:19.633
When you go outside the lines,

12:19.667 --> 12:21.468
there can be unintended consequences,

12:21.502 --> 12:24.071
so let's see what they are
before we respond.

12:24.769 --> 12:26.373
I didn't ask to see you.

12:26.407 --> 12:29.509
I know. I just knew you'd want to.

12:31.279 --> 12:33.714
This algorithm Barish wants
to use is so far from objective

12:33.748 --> 12:35.515
I can't even find a word to describe it.

12:35.550 --> 12:36.750
Subjective?

12:36.784 --> 12:37.884
It's called EVALUATE?

12:37.919 --> 12:39.019
I evaluated EVALUATE,

12:39.053 --> 12:41.388
and Keenan is now twice as
likely to get a max sentence

12:41.422 --> 12:43.323
just because he's black, from Mott Haven,

12:43.358 --> 12:45.225
and dropped out of high school at 15.

12:45.259 --> 12:46.693
I've heard of these programs.

12:46.728 --> 12:48.061
They're intended to remove bias.

12:48.096 --> 12:49.763
The data is biased.

12:49.797 --> 12:52.566
A computer doesn't know
that Mott Haven is policed

12:52.600 --> 12:54.668
at a significantly higher rate
than Riverdale.

12:54.702 --> 12:55.869
Maybe it does know.

12:55.903 --> 12:57.904
But it can't possibly know why.

12:57.939 --> 13:00.340
This software has no historical context.

13:00.375 --> 13:03.610
It can't account for slavery,
Jim Crow, Reaganomics,

13:03.645 --> 13:06.213
the war on drugs,
a crumbling education system...

13:06.247 --> 13:07.948
- 10 more seconds.
- What?

13:07.982 --> 13:10.183
10 more seconds of preaching
to the choir,

13:10.218 --> 13:12.386
and then you have to decide what to do.

13:12.420 --> 13:13.720
You have to defend Keenan

13:13.755 --> 13:15.622
as vigorously as you can, of course,

13:15.657 --> 13:18.291
but you also have to consider
whether Judge Barish

13:18.326 --> 13:20.694
is going to listen to you,
whether she's dug in,

13:20.728 --> 13:23.630
whether your digging in is
gonna make it worse for Keenan.

13:23.665 --> 13:26.533
You have to be realistic.

13:30.438 --> 13:31.772
Keenan didn't finish high school

13:31.806 --> 13:33.774
because his mom's MS went
into hyperdrive.

13:33.808 --> 13:35.409
He <i>ha</i> to work so his brother

13:35.443 --> 13:36.620
could keep playing travel football.

13:36.644 --> 13:39.212
Keenan thinks his brother can
get a college scholarship,

13:39.247 --> 13:42.315
and if he lived one block over,
he'd be in a better zip code,

13:42.350 --> 13:44.718
according to that stupid machine.

13:44.752 --> 13:46.053
Then you've decided.

13:46.087 --> 13:47.287
Good.

13:47.321 --> 13:48.755
Fight the machine.

14:07.341 --> 14:08.675
Has she called to make a deal?

14:08.710 --> 14:09.743
She will.

14:09.777 --> 14:12.846
Did you know Kate was
Secretary General of the U.N.?

14:12.880 --> 14:16.016
In high school, model U.N.,
but still...

14:16.050 --> 14:17.951
What happened at sentencing?

14:21.222 --> 14:23.290
Yes.

14:23.324 --> 14:24.424
Okay.

14:24.459 --> 14:25.792
I'll be right there.

14:25.827 --> 14:28.562
- Kate?
- No.

14:32.834 --> 14:34.468
I saw you on the news.

14:34.502 --> 14:36.169
They let us watch some TV.

14:36.204 --> 14:38.805
I'm trying to put some pressure
on the government

14:38.840 --> 14:40.113
to bring them to the table.

14:40.148 --> 14:41.808
And...?

14:41.843 --> 14:44.444
And I haven't heard from them yet.

14:44.479 --> 14:46.046
Good.

14:46.080 --> 14:47.481
I don't want a deal.

14:47.515 --> 14:48.849
What are you talking about, Dani?

14:48.883 --> 14:51.685
You called me a hero.
I wasn't trying to be.

14:51.719 --> 14:53.787
I mean, it wasn't like
I wanted to get caught,

14:53.821 --> 14:55.047
but I was.

14:55.081 --> 14:56.857
And now I'm hearing from people...

14:56.891 --> 14:59.465
people who need someone to listen, and...

15:00.194 --> 15:02.896
I want to stand up for them
like you stood up for me.

15:02.930 --> 15:04.698
Standing up for people is my job.

15:04.732 --> 15:07.167
It's not your job.

15:07.201 --> 15:08.702
It's who you are.

15:08.736 --> 15:11.805
A job is what I was doing on the
14th floor of the Vetracom Building,

15:11.839 --> 15:14.708
working for the NSA,
but it's not who I am.

15:14.742 --> 15:16.576
It's crazy... I served in Iraq,

15:16.611 --> 15:18.845
but this feels like the real test for me.

15:18.880 --> 15:20.814
- It's time to be brave.
- You are brave,

15:20.848 --> 15:22.459
but that doesn't mean staying in jail.

15:22.493 --> 15:25.485
It does mean that if that's what
it takes to send a message.

15:25.520 --> 15:27.354
If I take a deal and plead guilty,

15:27.388 --> 15:28.755
what message does that send?

15:28.790 --> 15:30.357
That I didn't believe in what I did?

15:30.391 --> 15:31.491
That I was wrong?

15:31.526 --> 15:34.861
Our government is targeting
people who are sick and hurt

15:34.896 --> 15:36.763
and brought to emergency rooms
by relatives

15:36.798 --> 15:39.699
who are terrified of
going to the hospital,

15:39.734 --> 15:41.835
but they risk it because
they're even more terrified

15:41.869 --> 15:43.570
of losing a loved one.

15:43.604 --> 15:45.172
And now...

15:45.206 --> 15:46.873
They'll lose them anyway.

15:46.908 --> 15:48.775
All my life, I've been
around people like this,

15:48.810 --> 15:50.043
who were afraid to stand up

15:50.077 --> 15:51.912
because they felt like they couldn't.

15:51.946 --> 15:54.114
But now I have a choice.

15:54.148 --> 15:55.949
<i>You</i> showed me that.

15:55.983 --> 15:58.518
I can sit at the table
and negotiate away my soul,

15:58.553 --> 16:00.854
or I can stand up...

16:00.888 --> 16:02.389
like you.

16:02.423 --> 16:04.391
I don't want to take a deal.

16:04.425 --> 16:06.293
You know what that means?

16:06.327 --> 16:08.695
It means I can make a difference.

16:13.036 --> 16:15.023
- She doesn't want a deal.
- Because?

16:15.057 --> 16:16.458
Because of me, my press conference.

16:16.492 --> 16:18.293
- So try again.
- It's not gonna happen.

16:18.327 --> 16:20.762
Dani doesn't want a deal
because there isn't a deal.

16:20.796 --> 16:23.898
It's always easier to say "no"
to something in the abstract.

16:23.933 --> 16:26.067
People say, "I don't want
to get married."

16:26.102 --> 16:28.970
Then some handsome man stands
there, telling you he loves you,

16:29.005 --> 16:30.315
and before you know it, you're married.

16:30.339 --> 16:31.450
<i>I</i> don't want to get married.

16:31.474 --> 16:32.774
I really wouldn't recommend it.

16:32.808 --> 16:35.477
Talk to Kate, see what she's offering.

16:35.511 --> 16:38.613
Looking at 15 years in prison
versus a deal in hand,

16:38.648 --> 16:40.915
you'd be surprised
how quickly minds change.

16:51.360 --> 16:54.629
That's a Classic Italian from Zeno's.

16:54.664 --> 16:56.264
With extra peperoncinis.

16:56.299 --> 16:58.584
The greatest sandwich in the world.

16:59.902 --> 17:01.936
I'm gonna eat this until
you to tell me to stop.

17:01.971 --> 17:03.538
Okay, what's up?

17:03.572 --> 17:05.540
Judge Barish is using
a sentencing algorithm

17:05.574 --> 17:07.474
that was basically built
to screw my client

17:07.510 --> 17:08.795
and everyone who looks like him,

17:08.829 --> 17:10.845
and I'm pretty sure
I need the help of an expert

17:10.880 --> 17:12.180
to discredit it...

17:12.214 --> 17:14.392
namely, a mathematician.

17:15.651 --> 17:17.484
Okay.

17:17.520 --> 17:19.487
Okay. So... you go.

17:19.521 --> 17:20.888
Be nice.

17:20.923 --> 17:22.156
Your brother will be flattered.

17:22.180 --> 17:23.791
You don't know Eddie.

17:23.826 --> 17:25.460
Not as much as I'd like to.

17:25.493 --> 17:27.628
I'm the odd one out in this family.
You know that.

17:27.663 --> 17:30.532
They're all science and data
"great minds,"

17:30.566 --> 17:33.201
and I'm an idealistic public defender.

17:33.235 --> 17:34.869
It's squishy to them.

17:34.904 --> 17:36.181
I might as well be in a mime troupe.

17:36.205 --> 17:37.806
They don't get me.

17:37.840 --> 17:40.084
You probably don't get them.

17:40.776 --> 17:42.253
Whose side are you on?

17:44.680 --> 17:46.748
My God, this sandwich is so good.

17:46.782 --> 17:49.884
I'm sorry.

17:49.919 --> 17:51.886
You have a client who needs you.

17:51.921 --> 17:54.055
You share blood with
someone who can help.

17:54.090 --> 17:55.690
Do what you have to do.

17:56.926 --> 17:58.893
Give me that.

18:00.930 --> 18:02.997
I'm saying, a ship that size
dead in the water,

18:03.032 --> 18:04.776
we'd have to mobilize
a lot of tugboats to haul it in.

18:04.800 --> 18:06.778
McKenna sees that, he might
freak out and take hostages.

18:06.802 --> 18:08.503
We don't need to do this on the water.

18:08.537 --> 18:09.948
If the captain makes
a routine announcement,

18:09.972 --> 18:11.012
like "help is on the way,"

18:11.040 --> 18:12.851
you can send in tugboats
without raising suspicion

18:12.875 --> 18:15.443
and tow the ship to Manhattan,
which we can all agree

18:15.478 --> 18:16.755
is closer to where the boat is
than Brooklyn.

18:16.779 --> 18:18.913
It's not gonna happen.
What's not gonna happen?

18:18.948 --> 18:20.615
A storm's coming in, a big one.

18:20.649 --> 18:21.960
I'm not putting a bunch of little boats

18:21.984 --> 18:23.885
- on the water in a storm.
- He's right.

18:23.919 --> 18:25.630
Let the storm pass
and tow it somewhere then.

18:25.654 --> 18:28.690
Manhattan. Has to be here.

18:31.994 --> 18:33.179
Excuse me.

18:34.997 --> 18:36.698
- You'd have done the same thing.
- Never.

18:36.732 --> 18:38.443
And now you can send
all of these people home

18:38.467 --> 18:40.568
because I'm gonna get my boss
to call your boss

18:40.603 --> 18:41.803
and put a stop to this.

18:41.837 --> 18:44.706
And when he asks how I knew
Bart McKenna was on that ship?

18:44.740 --> 18:46.708
Meanwhile, I go to my boss,
who calls his boss,

18:46.742 --> 18:47.709
and on up it goes until it's settled

18:47.743 --> 18:49.421
by whichever guy owes
some other guy dinner,

18:49.445 --> 18:50.922
and everyone up the chain
thinks we're idiots

18:50.946 --> 18:52.023
for not figuring this out on our own.

18:52.047 --> 18:53.592
There's one crucial part of this
you're not getting.

18:53.616 --> 18:55.283
- This is my case.
- Was.

18:55.317 --> 18:57.952
Now it's nobody's. I snaked you. I did.

18:57.987 --> 18:59.554
So as an act of kindness,

18:59.588 --> 19:00.899
I'm gonna leave this up to the weather.

19:00.923 --> 19:02.272
- The weather?
- Storm.

19:02.307 --> 19:03.577
Ship will blow one way or the other.

19:03.601 --> 19:05.437
Whichever side it's closest to,
they get the case.

19:05.461 --> 19:07.061
- That's stupid.
- It's fair.

19:07.096 --> 19:08.607
- I don't trust you.
- I don't trust you.

19:08.631 --> 19:10.398
Deal?

19:10.433 --> 19:12.634
You're the worst.

19:12.668 --> 19:14.502
I would have done the same thing.

19:14.537 --> 19:16.838
But you're coming to my place
in Red Hook tonight

19:16.872 --> 19:19.641
and making this up to me
in the filthiest way possible.

19:31.020 --> 19:32.187
Sister.

19:32.221 --> 19:33.855
Brother.

19:33.889 --> 19:35.991
Anywhere you like.

19:36.892 --> 19:39.194
- First time <i>you've</i> been to my office.
- It's nice.

19:39.228 --> 19:40.628
I'm not in the basement anymore.

19:40.663 --> 19:42.373
That's good.

19:42.998 --> 19:44.632
How's work?

19:44.667 --> 19:46.367
That's kind of why I'm here.

19:46.402 --> 19:47.627
I need your help.

19:47.662 --> 19:50.972
Have you heard of the sentencing
software EVALUATE?

19:51.006 --> 19:52.373
It's amazing.

19:52.408 --> 19:53.697
Amazing?

19:53.731 --> 19:55.877
"Groundbreaking" and
"revolutionary" also apply.

19:55.911 --> 19:58.480
- The algorithm is biased.
- An algorithm isn't biased.

19:58.514 --> 20:00.949
That's definitively the point,
why it's a good thing.

20:00.983 --> 20:04.018
It sentences blacks and Latinos
disproportionately to whites

20:04.053 --> 20:06.387
- for the same crimes.
- So do judges, right?

20:06.422 --> 20:07.989
This algorithm is an improvement.

20:08.023 --> 20:09.824
It's a check on an alreadyflawed system.

20:09.859 --> 20:11.993
My client's looking at
more time than he should

20:12.027 --> 20:13.528
because of this software.

20:13.562 --> 20:15.330
More time than you think he should.

20:15.364 --> 20:17.198
You see? There. That's bias.

20:17.233 --> 20:18.743
I didn't come here to debate
this with you.

20:18.767 --> 20:20.969
Then why did you come here...
for the first time ever?

20:21.003 --> 20:22.127
To ask a favor.

20:22.162 --> 20:24.172
I need you to look at that software,

20:24.206 --> 20:26.875
look at the coding, tell me how it works.

20:26.909 --> 20:28.451
So you can discredit it?

20:28.486 --> 20:30.478
So I can do what's right by my client.

20:32.882 --> 20:35.316
Interesting tact when asking a favor,

20:35.351 --> 20:36.818
to insult what I do?

20:36.852 --> 20:38.987
But that's what you do,
whatever you want...

20:39.021 --> 20:41.856
answer to no one,
and everyone is at your service,

20:41.891 --> 20:43.602
- except I'm not Mom and Dad.
- I don't think you understand

20:43.626 --> 20:45.071
my relationship with Mom and Dad.

20:45.105 --> 20:47.038
I understand they let you live
in their gorgeous apartment.

20:47.062 --> 20:48.017
I live in Washington Heights.

20:48.051 --> 20:49.003
You said you wanted to be close to work.

20:49.038 --> 20:50.107
They never asked if I wanted it.

20:50.131 --> 20:51.364
They gave it to me out of pity

20:51.398 --> 20:53.568
because they think that
I can't take care of myself.

20:55.137 --> 20:56.938
I'm not surprised you believe that.

20:56.972 --> 20:59.073
I have to go.

21:04.480 --> 21:05.880
You've never been to my office.

21:05.915 --> 21:06.881
What?

21:06.916 --> 21:09.384
Your snarky comment
about me not visiting you?

21:09.418 --> 21:11.619
But you've never been
to my office either.

21:11.654 --> 21:13.588
That's fair.

21:13.622 --> 21:15.267
You want to know what
that algorithm can't do?

21:15.291 --> 21:16.457
Feel.

21:16.492 --> 21:17.926
Understand nuance.

21:17.960 --> 21:19.861
Empathize.

21:19.895 --> 21:22.030
No wonder you respect it so much.

21:36.178 --> 21:37.445
Ms. Bell.

21:37.479 --> 21:40.248
Please, call me Sandra.

21:40.282 --> 21:41.549
Let's get started.

21:41.584 --> 21:44.118
There are two counts against Ms. Rios

21:44.153 --> 21:45.510
under the Espionage Act,

21:45.544 --> 21:48.323
each of which carries
a maximum penalty of 15 years.

21:48.357 --> 21:50.291
If Ms. Rios pleads to one count,

21:50.326 --> 21:52.594
we will recommend 78 to 97 months,

21:52.628 --> 21:54.121
taking into consideration

21:54.155 --> 21:56.965
the severity of the leak
and prior criminal history.

21:56.999 --> 21:58.460
She has no prior criminal history.

21:58.494 --> 22:01.302
She has a juvenile adjudication
for disorderly conduct.

22:01.337 --> 22:02.831
When she was a juvenile.

22:02.866 --> 22:05.406
Juvenile adjudications can be
applied in sentencing, Ms. Bell.

22:05.441 --> 22:06.751
Don't lecture me about sentencing,

22:06.775 --> 22:07.675
and my name is Sandra.

22:07.710 --> 22:10.111
If you call me Ms. Bell again,
I'm leaving.

22:10.145 --> 22:12.113
The offer is 78 to 97 months.

22:12.147 --> 22:14.349
- That's too high.
- This isn't a negotiation.

22:14.383 --> 22:16.284
Then what is it?

22:16.318 --> 22:18.153
63 months.

22:22.157 --> 22:24.827
Why don't you tell me what
you have the authority to go to?

22:29.198 --> 22:31.666
I see. You don't have any authority.

22:31.700 --> 22:33.434
You came here to see what you could get

22:33.469 --> 22:35.013
and then try to sell it to your client.

22:35.037 --> 22:37.972
- Is that it?
- 63 months is not good enough.

22:38.007 --> 22:39.707
There is no offer of 63 months.

22:39.742 --> 22:41.009
You're withdrawing your offer?

22:41.043 --> 22:43.678
If you can't accept, I can't offer.

22:43.712 --> 22:44.846
Why doesn't she want a deal?

22:44.880 --> 22:46.881
Because she wants to take the stand

22:46.915 --> 22:49.290
so she can tell the world
how evil the government is.

22:49.324 --> 22:50.550
Dani loves her country.

22:50.585 --> 22:51.595
Odd way of showing it.

22:51.629 --> 22:53.031
I'm sorry, how long did you
serve in the military?

22:53.055 --> 22:54.822
Same amount of time you did.

22:54.857 --> 22:57.458
Why don't you be reasonable here?

22:57.493 --> 22:59.127
Why don't I be reasonable?

22:59.161 --> 23:01.963
Your client decides one day,
"You know what?"

23:01.997 --> 23:03.831
I'm gonna decide public policy

23:03.866 --> 23:05.371
for the United States government...

23:05.405 --> 23:06.901
me, by myself.

23:06.935 --> 23:08.369
Forget the laws passed

23:08.404 --> 23:10.338
by the elected representatives
of the people,

23:10.372 --> 23:12.140
the deliberations of the professionals

23:12.174 --> 23:14.976
charged with protecting
our national security

23:15.010 --> 23:16.678
and enforcing our immigration laws.

23:16.712 --> 23:20.481
I, Dani Rios, have decided
I know better than all that.

23:20.516 --> 23:22.150
I'm gonna do what I want.

23:22.184 --> 23:24.652
And my lawyer is gonna do what <i>she</i> wants

23:24.687 --> 23:27.221
and enter a plea negotiation
in total bad faith

23:27.256 --> 23:30.058
because we do what we want.

23:30.092 --> 23:32.260
Because everything works out in the end,

23:32.294 --> 23:34.062
"as long as I'm reasonable."

23:34.096 --> 23:36.597
Is this what you wanted to be...

23:36.632 --> 23:38.900
when you were growing up, really?

23:38.934 --> 23:40.501
I genuinely do not understand it.

23:40.536 --> 23:41.903
You're a glorified hall monitor

23:41.937 --> 23:43.370
walking around with your clipboard,

23:43.405 --> 23:46.407
taking names, checking lockers,
wrapping knuckles.

23:46.442 --> 23:49.973
Don't you care about what was
in those documents Dani leaked,

23:50.007 --> 23:51.212
what they mean,

23:51.246 --> 23:52.688
that our government is accessing

23:52.722 --> 23:56.117
confidential medical information
to deport people?

23:57.227 --> 23:58.800
Why are the rules more important

23:58.834 --> 24:00.881
than the people
they are designed to protect?

24:03.845 --> 24:05.712
I think we're done here...

24:05.746 --> 24:06.847
Ms. Bell.

24:33.661 --> 24:35.249
Come in, Sandra.

24:36.864 --> 24:39.586
You can go in, Ms. Littlejohn.

24:45.272 --> 24:46.573
I understand if you're upset...

24:46.607 --> 24:48.141
I'm not upset.

24:48.175 --> 24:49.462
I'm disappointed.

24:49.496 --> 24:51.188
I picked you for this case
because I thought

24:51.212 --> 24:53.179
you would identify with Dani...

24:53.214 --> 24:56.220
- identify with her, not <i>be</i> her.
- Dani isn't the problem.

24:56.254 --> 24:57.794
You let this woman get inside your head,

24:57.818 --> 24:59.252
and then you went into that meeting

24:59.286 --> 25:01.821
without the tools you needed
to get the job done.

25:01.855 --> 25:03.623
Dani is too young and naive

25:03.657 --> 25:06.326
to understand what's at
stake here, but you're not.

25:06.360 --> 25:07.860
Kate Littlejohn is unreasonable.

25:07.895 --> 25:08.928
She's a prosecutor.

25:08.963 --> 25:10.139
I think it's more than that.

25:10.173 --> 25:12.703
Don't let it be more than that.

25:13.901 --> 25:16.135
- I understand if you're upset.
- I'm very upset.

25:16.170 --> 25:18.638
- We're going to trial.
- No, you're not.

25:18.672 --> 25:21.274
- She rejected the deal.
- Well, try again.

25:21.308 --> 25:22.875
Sandra Bell is unreasonable.

25:22.910 --> 25:26.279
- She's a public defender.
- She's an unreasonable public defender.

25:26.313 --> 25:27.947
Now you're just getting redundant.

25:27.982 --> 25:30.327
This isn't about her. It's about
what's good for your client,

25:30.351 --> 25:31.728
and your client is the United States,

25:31.752 --> 25:34.725
and a trial is not good
for the United States.

25:38.225 --> 25:41.661
I picked you for this case
because you are stone cold.

25:41.695 --> 25:43.529
I do have feelings.

25:45.432 --> 25:46.737
They're in the way.

25:48.569 --> 25:50.072
<i>Jim, while the residents of New York's</i>

25:50.096 --> 25:51.815
<i>five boroughs still need
to prepare themselves</i>

25:51.839 --> 25:53.406
<i>for the brunt of the storm,</i>

25:53.440 --> 25:56.042
<i>we now see indications that
it might veer to the south.</i>

25:56.076 --> 25:57.753
No, no! Not south!

25:57.787 --> 26:00.146
- North! Go north!
- Hey.

26:00.180 --> 26:01.381
What's going on in here?

26:01.415 --> 26:03.349
- Storm's getting bigger.
- That's not good.

26:03.384 --> 26:05.161
Not if it blows that boat
to Brooklyn, it's not.

26:05.185 --> 26:08.554
Plus the possible loss of life
and property, but okay.

26:08.589 --> 26:09.899
You know why I became a prosecutor?

26:09.923 --> 26:11.768
So you could steal cases
from other prosecutors?

26:11.792 --> 26:13.226
'Cause we hold all the cards.

26:13.260 --> 26:15.061
We choose when to charge, if to charge,

26:15.095 --> 26:16.673
how much to charge, what evidence to use.

26:16.697 --> 26:18.865
We're in control.

26:18.899 --> 26:20.199
Today my whole job depends

26:20.234 --> 26:22.168
on something as random as the weather.

26:22.202 --> 26:23.670
Yeah, but fortunately for you,

26:23.704 --> 26:25.438
it's not 1875.

26:25.472 --> 26:27.240
What?

26:27.274 --> 26:28.572
For most of human existence,

26:28.607 --> 26:30.443
we didn't imagine weather
could be predicted

26:30.477 --> 26:32.712
or even should be
because that was God's area.

26:32.746 --> 26:36.949
But with the rise of technology
in the late 19th...

26:36.984 --> 26:38.581
As a teenager,

26:38.615 --> 26:41.354
I was a bit of an amateur meteorologist.

26:41.388 --> 26:42.922
You were into magic, too, I bet.

26:42.956 --> 26:44.624
Nah.

26:44.658 --> 26:46.359
I may have done a mentalist act.

26:46.393 --> 26:48.394
Anyway, point is,
by the turn of the century,

26:48.429 --> 26:49.796
the more information we had,

26:49.830 --> 26:51.059
the less that chance played a role

26:51.083 --> 26:53.266
in predicting the weather.

26:53.300 --> 26:56.469
Sit, predict.

26:56.503 --> 26:59.072
Well, first, you need to
understand the Coriolis effect.

26:59.106 --> 27:01.874
No, I mean tell me where
my ship is gonna land.

27:05.079 --> 27:06.713
I don't know why I'm so upset.

27:06.747 --> 27:08.414
- Jill's right.
- He's so wrong.

27:08.449 --> 27:11.117
- I'm being emotional.
- How can he have no emotions?

27:11.151 --> 27:13.111
But I've got this idealistic
girl in front of me.

27:13.145 --> 27:14.487
He's like talking to a robot.

27:14.521 --> 27:16.055
I do need to be the adult.

27:16.090 --> 27:17.600
All he cares about are facts and data.

27:17.624 --> 27:19.425
No one's interested in context.

27:19.460 --> 27:21.294
Dani can't see what's right for her.

27:21.328 --> 27:24.130
Soon we're all going to be
reduced to data points, numbers.

27:27.768 --> 27:29.435
My God.

27:29.470 --> 27:31.304
Thank you.

27:36.643 --> 27:38.411
I literally had to wade through a crowd

27:38.445 --> 27:40.346
of your supporters to get in here.

27:41.348 --> 27:42.348
You did?

27:42.383 --> 27:45.351
At least 300 people.

27:45.386 --> 27:48.788
This is all so strange.

27:48.822 --> 27:51.457
Tomorrow, there will be more people,

27:51.492 --> 27:53.593
even more when the trial starts.

27:53.627 --> 27:57.430
The reading of the verdict will
be an absolute spectacle.

27:57.464 --> 27:59.999
And if you're convicted,

28:00.033 --> 28:02.034
your supporters will be outraged.

28:02.069 --> 28:05.037
They'll march to stop the lying
and spying you exposed.

28:05.072 --> 28:07.974
They'll organize to stop
these deportations.

28:08.008 --> 28:10.109
They'll get brave, just like you.

28:10.144 --> 28:12.445
They'll stand up.

28:12.479 --> 28:14.046
But you...

28:14.081 --> 28:16.482
You won't get to be a part of it,

28:16.517 --> 28:18.451
this community you helped to create,

28:18.485 --> 28:19.862
because you will be here,

28:19.896 --> 28:22.355
just another number
in the federal prison system.

28:22.389 --> 28:24.772
45278054.

28:24.806 --> 28:26.058
That will be you.

28:31.064 --> 28:33.153
I want to make a difference.

28:33.867 --> 28:36.536
Then let me get you out of here.

28:36.570 --> 28:38.571
Let me go to the table.

28:38.605 --> 28:40.206
Let me do the job I was meant to do

28:40.240 --> 28:42.829
so you can do what you were meant to do.

28:43.610 --> 28:45.812
Stand up and fight.

28:54.495 --> 28:57.263
I know you like to eat
at 12:30 on the dot,

28:57.298 --> 29:00.196
so I brought you something.

29:01.079 --> 29:02.802
Classic Italian from Zeno's.

29:02.837 --> 29:05.939
You don't like peperoncinis, but you
prefer to pull them off yourself.

29:05.973 --> 29:07.739
You introduced me to this place.

29:07.740 --> 29:09.808
I've had this sandwich a thousand times,

29:09.842 --> 29:13.244
and there's always exactly
24 peperoncinis inside.

29:13.279 --> 29:15.079
You don't want to know the odds on that.

29:15.114 --> 29:16.404
I don't.

29:18.484 --> 29:21.701
I'm grateful for the sandwich,
but I'm not helping you.

29:22.822 --> 29:25.219
I'm sorry about what I said before.

29:25.254 --> 29:27.559
I'm sorry about how you feel
about Mom and Dad

29:27.593 --> 29:28.660
and about me growing up.

29:28.694 --> 29:30.962
It's just crazy because
I always looked up to you.

29:30.996 --> 29:32.764
I was jealous that

29:32.798 --> 29:35.066
you wanted to follow in their footsteps.

29:35.100 --> 29:37.302
I was jealous of how much
they seemed to love it.

29:37.336 --> 29:38.747
I felt like they didn't care as much

29:38.771 --> 29:39.971
about the things I was into.

29:40.005 --> 29:41.673
I felt like I never had a chance.

29:43.275 --> 29:45.677
Look, I'm the oldest.

29:45.711 --> 29:48.112
They were into math and science,
so I wanted to be.

29:48.147 --> 29:49.814
I didn't have anything to rebel against.

29:49.849 --> 29:51.816
It was me and them.

29:51.851 --> 29:53.852
You felt like they didn't understand you.

29:53.886 --> 29:55.987
I felt like they let you be you.

29:56.021 --> 29:57.655
Free.

29:57.690 --> 29:58.923
They're controlling.

29:58.958 --> 30:00.091
You never saw that.

30:00.125 --> 30:01.759
You think living in that apartment

30:01.794 --> 30:03.328
doesn't come with strings?

30:03.362 --> 30:04.924
You don't think it gets thrown in my face

30:04.948 --> 30:08.666
anytime I don't call for a week
or blow off dinner with them?

30:10.236 --> 30:11.803
This kid, Keenan,

30:11.837 --> 30:14.806
is about to get lost
in the federal prison system.

30:14.840 --> 30:16.774
Every extra day he spends in there

30:16.809 --> 30:20.378
is one less day he gets to spend
with the brother he adores.

30:20.412 --> 30:22.046
It's 12:30.

30:22.081 --> 30:23.805
You got to eat.

30:25.484 --> 30:28.453
Two people can see the same
factual events differently.

30:28.487 --> 30:29.854
You and I are an example of that.

30:29.889 --> 30:32.524
It's why humans are imperfect machines.

30:32.558 --> 30:34.893
That's why we need these algorithms.

30:34.927 --> 30:37.295
You're trying to fight the algorithm.

30:37.329 --> 30:38.963
You want to discredit the data...

30:38.998 --> 30:40.532
That's the wrong approach.

30:40.566 --> 30:41.633
Okay.

30:41.667 --> 30:42.834
Use the data.

30:42.868 --> 30:44.369
Play the human,

30:44.403 --> 30:45.827
the judge.

30:46.672 --> 30:48.840
Machines don't have ego.

30:48.874 --> 30:49.974
People do.

30:54.780 --> 30:57.649
How are things with the AUSA
who shall not be named?

30:57.683 --> 30:59.484
Off to see her now.

30:59.518 --> 31:00.852
I'm sorry.

31:00.886 --> 31:02.921
But that also means you convinced Dani

31:02.955 --> 31:04.395
to let you negotiate a deal for her.

31:04.423 --> 31:05.557
I know. Small victories.

31:05.591 --> 31:06.701
Big victories. Congratulations.

31:06.725 --> 31:08.837
Well, at the very least,
I'm not gonna fill up our office

31:08.861 --> 31:11.062
with hundreds of boxes of discovery.

31:11.096 --> 31:13.531
Hundreds of boxes of discovery?

31:13.566 --> 31:14.876
The government would never
produce documents

31:14.900 --> 31:16.901
in a case like this.

31:31.450 --> 31:33.051
<i>- You're late.</i>
- I'm not late.

31:33.085 --> 31:34.752
I'm pretty good with time.

31:34.787 --> 31:36.131
I'm not late because I'm not coming,

31:36.155 --> 31:37.232
but I'll be in court in an hour.

31:37.256 --> 31:38.256
You should be there, too.

31:43.562 --> 31:45.396
As you're aware, the statute under which.

31:45.431 --> 31:48.967
Ms. Rios is being charged, 18 USC 793d,

31:49.001 --> 31:51.302
requires that the government
prove Ms. Rios' leak

31:51.337 --> 31:52.904
caused injury to the United States

31:52.938 --> 31:54.906
or advantage to a foreign government.

31:54.940 --> 31:56.251
As long as the government refuses

31:56.275 --> 31:57.642
to even acknowledge the existence

31:57.676 --> 31:59.577
of the surveillance program
Ms. Rios leaked,

31:59.612 --> 32:01.879
it is impossible to determine
whether it could cause

32:01.914 --> 32:04.197
injury or advantage.

32:04.850 --> 32:06.384
What exactly are you saying?

32:06.418 --> 32:08.330
I'm saying that,
in order to prepare our defense,

32:08.354 --> 32:10.455
we need the government
to produce all the documents

32:10.489 --> 32:12.056
related to this surveillance program.

32:12.091 --> 32:14.492
Those are highlyclassified
documents, Your Honor.

32:14.526 --> 32:16.828
That are essential to our defense.

32:16.862 --> 32:18.796
This is an unusual request.

32:18.831 --> 32:20.286
We're in an unusual situation.

32:20.321 --> 32:21.899
Your Honor, if you grant this request,

32:21.934 --> 32:24.002
the government will be forced to choose

32:24.036 --> 32:26.070
between revealing classified information

32:26.105 --> 32:28.506
and continuing with this prosecution.

32:29.556 --> 32:32.310
I understand
the government's predicament.

32:32.344 --> 32:34.512
But the basis for this request is valid,

32:34.546 --> 32:35.780
and I'll grant it.

32:38.217 --> 32:39.917
As the production of these documents is

32:39.952 --> 32:41.997
obviously problematic
for the government, I assume...

32:42.021 --> 32:43.655
We'll produce the documents.

32:43.689 --> 32:45.657
- What?
- Ms. Littlejohn...

32:45.691 --> 32:47.293
We'll produce the documents.

32:47.327 --> 32:49.304
Do you need to check with your
supervisor, Ms. Littlejohn?

32:49.328 --> 32:51.029
- No.
- You sure?

32:51.063 --> 32:53.164
Yes, however, the documents will need

32:53.198 --> 32:55.533
to undergo a full
nationalsecurity review

32:55.567 --> 32:57.935
and then be redacted prior to production.

32:57.970 --> 33:00.171
Based on the volume and
sensitivity of this material,

33:00.205 --> 33:02.974
I'd estimate a delay
of at least 18 months,

33:03.008 --> 33:05.043
during which time, the government would

33:05.077 --> 33:07.712
strongly advocate for
Ms. Rios' continued detention.

33:07.746 --> 33:09.536
- Your Honor...
- I'd like to see the two of you

33:09.560 --> 33:11.616
in my chambers now.

33:15.320 --> 33:18.022
Listen, I'm not gonna get
involved on one side of this,

33:18.057 --> 33:21.025
but I know neither of you
wants this case to go to trial.

33:21.060 --> 33:23.494
Figure this out.

33:39.651 --> 33:41.803
His name was Richard Prince.

33:43.509 --> 33:46.056
You asked me why I wanted to do this?

33:46.091 --> 33:47.091
Richard Prince...

33:47.125 --> 33:49.226
He sat behind me in
Ms. Diller's history class.

33:49.260 --> 33:52.329
He talked a lot. He cheated.

33:52.363 --> 33:53.893
At the end of the first semester,

33:53.928 --> 33:57.034
he had the highest grade in
the class because he cheated.

33:57.068 --> 33:58.802
I liked school.

33:58.837 --> 34:01.638
Richard didn't like school.

34:01.673 --> 34:02.706
Maybe he didn't need it.

34:02.741 --> 34:06.310
I don't know, I don't care. <i>I</i> needed it.

34:06.344 --> 34:09.313
I looked forward to Mondays, school.

34:09.347 --> 34:11.616
The weekends, when I was at home...

34:14.886 --> 34:18.522
We had two field trips every
year in my middle school.

34:18.556 --> 34:20.023
The big one in seventh grade

34:20.058 --> 34:22.159
was across the state to the U.S. Capitol.

34:22.193 --> 34:25.228
I had been looking forward
to the Capitol trip

34:25.755 --> 34:28.532
since I was... 5 years old.

34:28.565 --> 34:30.400
I'd memorized every Speaker of the House

34:30.435 --> 34:31.568
since Frederick Muhlenberg.

34:31.603 --> 34:33.437
I knew that the prize

34:33.471 --> 34:35.339
for designing the Capitol building

34:35.373 --> 34:36.739
was $500.

34:36.775 --> 34:39.042
I knew that the Dome was made

34:39.077 --> 34:42.279
of 8,999,200 pounds of cast iron.

34:42.313 --> 34:43.413
I knew this,

34:43.447 --> 34:45.882
and I wrote all these things
down in a little notebook,

34:45.917 --> 34:47.551
and I pasted pictures into the notebook

34:47.585 --> 34:49.429
so I could bring it with me
when we went our trip

34:49.454 --> 34:52.956
and make sure I saw everything
I'd ever read about.

34:52.991 --> 34:54.725
I was more excited about this trip

34:54.759 --> 34:57.328
than I've ever been about
anything in my life.

34:58.209 --> 35:00.177
We were 18 miles outside of Roanoke

35:00.211 --> 35:04.748
when Richard Prince pulled out
his phone on the bus.

35:04.783 --> 35:06.717
There was one strict rule on this trip...

35:06.751 --> 35:09.385
no electronic devices, none.

35:09.419 --> 35:14.024
But Richard Prince had brought his phone.

35:14.059 --> 35:15.659
Ms. Diller told him to put it away.

35:15.694 --> 35:16.760
He refused.

35:16.795 --> 35:18.228
His friends started to defend him.

35:18.263 --> 35:19.363
It got loud.

35:19.397 --> 35:22.166
I sat in the back of the bus
with my hands over my ears,

35:22.200 --> 35:23.534
looking through my notebook,

35:23.568 --> 35:26.036
staring at pictures of the Dome,

35:26.071 --> 35:28.405
the crypt, the Old Senate Chamber.

35:28.440 --> 35:31.108
But it just got louder, louder,
more out of control,

35:31.142 --> 35:36.413
and then I felt...
the wheels of the bus turn.

35:38.083 --> 35:41.251
I didn't look up, but I felt it.

35:41.286 --> 35:43.220
We were going home.

35:43.254 --> 35:45.122
I was looking forward
to that Capitol trip

35:45.156 --> 35:47.124
for six years... six years...

35:47.158 --> 35:49.693
and I did not get to go,

35:49.728 --> 35:54.198
because Richard Prince decided
the rules didn't apply to him.

35:54.232 --> 35:59.057
49 kids didn't get to go
because of 1 person.

36:00.005 --> 36:03.474
Is this what I wanted to be
when I was growing up?

36:03.508 --> 36:07.778
Yes. Injustice isn't only felt

36:07.812 --> 36:11.152
by the loudest person
complaining about it.

36:15.153 --> 36:17.321
The government withdraws
the espionage charges

36:17.355 --> 36:20.724
and Dani pleads guilty
to theft of government property.

36:20.759 --> 36:23.761
Time served plus three years
of supervised release.

36:36.107 --> 36:39.276
- Roger.
- Hey, sorry about that ship.

36:39.310 --> 36:40.548
Why sorry?

36:40.583 --> 36:43.313
I heard it didn't end up
in Brooklyn or Manhattan.

36:43.348 --> 36:45.983
- New Jersey.
- That's a kick in the ass?

36:46.017 --> 36:47.518
Actually, because of some

36:47.552 --> 36:49.687
weatherpredicting calculations
I won't bore you with,

36:49.721 --> 36:51.155
I knew where that ship was going.

36:51.189 --> 36:52.923
So I arranged to thank some NYPD officers

36:52.957 --> 36:53.981
that have been assisting me
by sending them

36:54.005 --> 36:55.693
to a fine dinner at a great restaurant,

36:55.727 --> 36:57.461
which happened to be near New Jersey's.

36:57.495 --> 36:59.029
Cape Liberty Cruise Ship port.

36:59.064 --> 37:00.030
So they were in perfect position

37:00.065 --> 37:01.965
to nab McKenna
when he stepped off that ship,

37:02.000 --> 37:04.168
and before the sun came up,
he was safely back here,

37:04.202 --> 37:06.870
in the arms of the
Southern District of New York.

37:06.905 --> 37:09.673
Winwin. I'm off here.

37:18.049 --> 37:21.485
Your Honor, I understand the appeal

37:21.519 --> 37:24.221
of using this sentencing
software, EVALUATE.

37:24.255 --> 37:25.656
I do.

37:25.690 --> 37:28.892
It appears to be efficient, precise,

37:28.927 --> 37:32.362
immune to emotion and lapses in logic.

37:32.397 --> 37:34.965
It seems fair and unbiased,

37:34.999 --> 37:37.735
so shouldn't we attempt
to be fair and unbiased

37:37.769 --> 37:40.904
in evaluating whether it actually works?

37:40.939 --> 37:44.308
32, 19, 34.

37:44.342 --> 37:47.311
Are you picking lotto numbers
for me, Ms. Adams?

37:47.345 --> 37:50.581
32% is the federal recidivism rate.

37:50.615 --> 37:52.216
19%?

37:52.250 --> 37:55.886
19% is the recidivism rate
of defendants tried

37:55.920 --> 37:58.422
and sentenced in <i>your</i> court,
Judge Barish.

37:58.456 --> 38:01.024
It's one of the lowest
in the Southern District.

38:01.059 --> 38:02.326
34%?

38:02.360 --> 38:05.162
That's the recidivism rate of EVALUATE,

38:05.196 --> 38:06.930
higher than the national average,

38:06.965 --> 38:09.266
15 points behind you.

38:09.300 --> 38:11.368
I'm sure you have a theory
as to why that is.

38:11.402 --> 38:13.237
I think you know I do,

38:13.271 --> 38:16.140
but you asked me to have faith in you,

38:16.174 --> 38:19.109
in your experience, your
judgment, and I do.

38:19.144 --> 38:21.578
And these numbers back that up.

38:21.613 --> 38:25.415
You're not arbitrary or capricious.

38:27.385 --> 38:29.520
When you were in elementary school,

38:29.554 --> 38:32.356
IBM built a computer that it claimed

38:32.390 --> 38:34.825
could beat a world champion in chess.

38:34.859 --> 38:37.995
It couldn't. Lost to Garry Kasparov.

38:38.029 --> 38:41.431
IBM made some tweaks,
and Deep Blue the rematch.

38:41.466 --> 38:43.267
Today, every one of us can download

38:43.301 --> 38:45.402
free chess software on our phones

38:45.436 --> 38:47.905
that would demolish Kasparov.

38:47.939 --> 38:53.105
Technology isn't perfect,
but it's always improving.

38:53.945 --> 38:58.448
I may have been premature
in relying on EVALUATE,

38:58.483 --> 39:03.954
but this is the future, Ms. Adams.

39:04.617 --> 39:07.791
I appreciate your arguments here today.

39:15.934 --> 39:18.202
This is it.

39:18.236 --> 39:19.632
Own it.

39:24.275 --> 39:26.310
My name is Dani Rios.

39:26.344 --> 39:29.379
I stand here today
as a veteran, a patriot,

39:29.414 --> 39:30.791
and the proud daughter of immigrants.

39:30.815 --> 39:31.836
Well, how does it feel to be free?

39:31.860 --> 39:32.993
What is it like to be a folk hero?

39:33.017 --> 39:34.151
I am not a hero.

39:34.185 --> 39:35.886
I am just a regular American citizen

39:35.920 --> 39:37.721
who wanted to shine light on injustice.

39:43.294 --> 39:44.795
Thank you. That's all for now.

39:44.829 --> 39:46.033
Thank you.

39:59.510 --> 40:01.311
I like it.

40:01.346 --> 40:02.423
How long you been working on that?

40:02.447 --> 40:03.747
Long time.

40:03.781 --> 40:05.082
Ever been?

40:05.116 --> 40:07.430
No.

40:15.684 --> 40:17.194
Come home with me.

40:17.228 --> 40:19.463
Barish only gave Keenan six months.

40:19.497 --> 40:21.298
The government wanted two years.

40:21.332 --> 40:22.532
We're celebrating.

40:22.567 --> 40:25.135
I know you prefer wine out of the box,

40:25.169 --> 40:26.470
but this is amazing.

40:26.504 --> 40:28.011
I've got work to do.

40:28.045 --> 40:30.384
If you don't come home with me,
I'll drink this entire bottle.

40:30.408 --> 40:32.976
You know what happens when I
drink an entire bottle of wine.

40:33.011 --> 40:34.955
You do all the Schuyler sister
parts from "Hamilton"

40:34.979 --> 40:36.546
and our neighbor calls the cops.

40:36.581 --> 40:38.949
Don't do that to me.

40:38.983 --> 40:41.051
Please.

40:44.601 --> 40:46.456
Hey, you got to come out for drinks.

40:46.491 --> 40:47.858
No date tonight?

40:47.892 --> 40:49.470
She might need a little coolingoff time.

40:49.494 --> 40:51.528
Well, I can't, thanks. I have to work.

40:51.562 --> 40:53.730
I don't care. I told Seth I
owe him a drink sometime

40:53.765 --> 40:56.466
for his help with the cruise ship.
He said tonight's good.

40:56.501 --> 40:59.369
I'm not drinking alone with him.
Don't make me do that.

41:13.851 --> 41:15.252
Guest of honor.

41:21.025 --> 41:22.159
Reach in my pocket.

41:22.193 --> 41:23.560
Don't.

41:23.594 --> 41:24.861
No way my card's in there.

41:26.531 --> 41:28.432
Dude... That's incredible.

41:28.466 --> 41:30.233
Would've been cooler if it was a rabbit.

41:36.641 --> 41:38.608
- Can you feel that?
- One more.

41:38.643 --> 41:39.776
Nice.

41:43.948 --> 41:45.515
Hi.

41:45.550 --> 41:48.030
- Long time.
- Too long.
