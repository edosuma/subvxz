Don't worry. You'll get
your food supply.

00:16.040 --> 00:18.680

very grateful.</i>

00:18.760 --> 00:21.149
<i>I had no idea
the rebels were so well equipped.</i>

00:21.240 --> 00:23.038
Truthfully, they're not.

00:23.120 --> 00:25.634
We're fortunate to get some of the few
pilots they actually have.

00:25.720 --> 00:26.994
(ALARM CHIMES)

00:27.360 --> 00:28.714
Sir! There's an
Imperial warship

00:28.840 --> 00:30.592
coming out of hyperspace,
dead ahead.

00:39.400 --> 00:40.959
They've brought fighters.

00:41.040 --> 00:42.872
Green Three, Green Four,
stay with the transport.

00:42.960 --> 00:44.314
All others, follow me.

00:57.280 --> 00:59.191
Headed for the transport!

01:03.600 --> 01:05.113
Deflector shields
are down!

01:06.600 --> 01:08.318
They're too fast.
I can't get a shot!

01:10.200 --> 01:12.271

We are unarmed!
You have no right to fire on us.

01:28.240 --> 01:29.799
I beg to differ.

01:42.320 --> 01:44.675
Hey. We heard the supply run
to Teralov failed.

01:44.760 --> 01:48.071
It gets worse.
We lost the entire escort of A-wings.

01:48.160 --> 01:51.073
Six pilots
and the transport's entire crew.

01:51.160 --> 01:52.719
How many is that this month?

01:52.840 --> 01:54.069
At this rate, there's not
gonna be anyone left

01:54.160 --> 01:55.559
to fly for the Rebellion.

01:55.640 --> 01:59.759
Fortunately, I have been working on a
solution with the help of Fulcrum.

01:59.840 --> 02:01.069
Ahsoka?

02:01.160 --> 02:04.596
No. Fulcrum's a code name
we give to our secret informants.

02:04.680 --> 02:06.239
It was Ahsoka's idea.

02:06.320 --> 02:09.995
There are other Fulcrum
agents. She was among them.

headed for Skystrike.

fake credentials.

02:40.440 --> 02:43.159
Wait, wait.
Shouldn't I be the one to go in?

02:43.240 --> 02:45.072
I've done this before,
remember?

02:45.160 --> 02:48.039
Yeah, and I really was
an Imperial cadet once.

02:48.120 --> 02:49.758
For years, remember?

02:49.840 --> 02:52.116
The Empire knows you
too well, Ezra.

02:52.200 --> 02:53.429
You'll be identified.

02:53.520 --> 02:56.114
Sabine is
the least recognizable of all of us.

02:56.200 --> 02:58.589
I need you and Kanan
to shadow her.

02:58.680 --> 03:00.637
You'll stay in communication
while she's inside

03:00.720 --> 03:02.677
and be ready to
help her escape.

03:02.760 --> 03:06.594

for the new relief mission to Teralov.

of these solo missions.

04:56.840 --> 04:58.751
Listen carefully, cadets.

04:58.840 --> 05:02.674
You are here because the Empire
sees the potential in you

05:02.760 --> 05:06.640
to join the ranks
of its most elite pilots.

05:07.640 --> 05:09.438
Most of you will fail.

have achieved before means nothing.

Cadets, exit your pods.

07:53.800 --> 07:55.473

08:07.920 --> 08:09.718
What kind of rebel ship
was that?

08:09.840 --> 08:11.831
That was no transport.

08:15.480 --> 08:17.710
Ah, but you are wrong, cadet.

08:17.800 --> 08:19.677
It was a transport
called the Ghost,

08:19.760 --> 08:21.797
which has been modified
for combat.

08:21.880 --> 08:24.633
The rebels
are a desperate group of extremists.

08:24.720 --> 08:26.393
They'll fight
with any ship,

08:26.480 --> 08:29.472
using any means necessary
to undermine our authority.

08:29.560 --> 08:32.791
That is why orders must be
followed without question.

08:32.880 --> 08:34.712
Insubordination
like yours

08:34.799 --> 08:36.950
will get you
and your wingman killed.

Understood?
- Yes, sir.

08:42.200 --> 08:44.476
Understood, cadet?

08:45.200 --> 08:46.395
Yes, sir.

08:52.760 --> 08:54.990
I see you don't
just take risks when you're flying.

08:55.080 --> 08:58.152
Well, I trust my gut,
and I know right from wrong.

08:58.240 --> 09:01.392
I respect that.
A lot of people here won't.

09:18.240 --> 09:20.754
Governor Pryce, Agent Kallus.

09:20.840 --> 09:23.673
May I ask the reason
for this unscheduled visit?

09:23.760 --> 09:26.479
ISB has information
that some of your cadets

09:26.560 --> 09:29.120
are planning to defect
to the rebels.

09:29.200 --> 09:31.237
You have traitors
in your midst.

09:31.320 --> 09:32.833
Impossible.

09:32.920 --> 09:36.390
My cadets are unmatched,
both in their skill and loyalty.

09:36.480 --> 09:40.519
Nevertheless, I will be
conducting a thorough investigation,

09:40.640 --> 09:43.758
and you are to extend
your full cooperation.

09:45.560 --> 09:47.471
Agent Kallus,
you may begin.

09:47.560 --> 09:50.757
My hope is that
I may teach you something today.

09:56.600 --> 09:58.671
I told you
it was too risky.

09:58.760 --> 10:00.319
How are we gonna
get out of this?

10:00.400 --> 10:02.835
Will you just relax?
They don't know.

10:02.920 --> 10:05.116
If they did,
we'd be in the brig.

10:12.640 --> 10:14.074
Something wrong, Wedge?

10:14.400 --> 10:16.311
Uh, no. Why?

10:16.400 --> 10:17.834
You just look nervous.

10:18.400 --> 10:21.552
Uh, actually, I've been thinking about
what you said in the simulator today.

10:21.680 --> 10:23.432
About how this wasn't
what you signed up for.

10:23.560 --> 10:26.234
Look, I want to do my part
for the Empire,

10:26.320 --> 10:29.551
but firing on unarmed ships
wasn't what I had in mind.

10:29.640 --> 10:30.869
What about you?

10:30.960 --> 10:33.759
I was flying cargo ships
when the Empire recruited me.

10:33.840 --> 10:36.150
At the time,
I figured, why not?

10:36.280 --> 10:39.636
Seemed a whole lot more exciting than
hauling spare parts around the galaxy.

10:39.720 --> 10:42.838
But if this is what the Empire's
becoming, I don't know.

10:43.400 --> 10:45.755
Hmm. You ever think
about getting out?

10:45.840 --> 10:48.958
That's not really
possible, is it?

10:49.040 --> 10:51.316
Maybe more possible
than you realize.

10:51.400 --> 10:52.913
What are you
talking about?

10:53.520 --> 10:55.272
My real name
is Sabine Wren.

10:55.360 --> 10:57.351
I was sent in
to get you out.

10:57.880 --> 10:59.632
So the Rebellion did
get my message.

10:59.760 --> 11:02.354
Yes. But I heard there were
other pilots who want out, too.

11:02.440 --> 11:03.999
There are.

11:04.080 --> 11:07.550
Okay, we need to leave now,
before the Empire closes in.

11:07.640 --> 11:08.835
Can you get them ready?

11:08.920 --> 11:10.718
I'll talk to them.
What's your plan?

11:11.040 --> 11:13.111
Well, I'll tell you
when I figure that out.

11:13.200 --> 11:14.474
Are you serious?

11:14.560 --> 11:16.392
Welcome to the Rebellion.

11:21.400 --> 11:23.914
Ezra, you need
to calm down.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.354
How can I be calm, huh?

11:25.440 --> 11:27.716
Sabine's stuck over there,
and there's nothing I can do.

11:27.880 --> 11:30.235
That's right.
There's nothing you can do.

11:30.320 --> 11:33.199
So nothing
you are doing right now is going to help.

11:33.280 --> 11:34.554
Sit down.

11:35.880 --> 11:39.475
Ezra, part of a Jedi's wisdom
comes from learning to accept

11:39.560 --> 11:42.279
when a situation
is out of our control.

11:42.360 --> 11:45.000
- Do you trust her?
- Of course I trust her.

11:45.080 --> 11:47.230
Good. Then trust
she'll succeed.

11:54.960 --> 11:57.679
My investigation
is nearly complete, Governor.

11:57.760 --> 12:00.479
I have found nothing
as of yet.

12:00.560 --> 12:01.789
Then perhaps it's time for me

12:01.880 --> 12:04.679
to take a more direct hand
in this enquiry.

12:04.760 --> 12:06.990
With all due respect,
Governor,

12:07.120 --> 12:09.714
I am trying
to train pilots here.

12:09.800 --> 12:12.679
How are they to progress
under these circumstances?

12:12.760 --> 12:14.831
Certainly not while
they are all grounded.

12:14.960 --> 12:16.712
You're quite right.

12:16.840 --> 12:18.877
Perhaps getting your cadets
back into space

12:18.960 --> 12:21.998
would be to our
mutual advantage.

12:22.080 --> 12:25.675

12:29.640 --> 12:31.551

12:31.640 --> 12:33.631
There's no
turning back now.

Well, we have to make
the most of this chance.

12:42.840 --> 12:44.513
We might not get another.

12:44.600 --> 12:47.752
Okay, listen. There's a rebel ship
nearby, waiting for my signal.

12:47.840 --> 12:50.559
Watch me.
When I go, you go.

12:50.640 --> 12:53.075
But you have to
trust me. Agreed?

12:53.160 --> 12:56.232
These rebels you say
are waiting for us... You trust them?

12:56.320 --> 12:57.719

12:57.800 --> 13:00.314
Yeah, and all of ours.

13:32.400 --> 13:36.792
<i>but your hits will still
register and be scored.</i>

13:37.200 --> 13:38.793
Beginning on my mark.

13:39.400 --> 13:41.835
<i>Three, two, one.</i>

13:41.920 --> 13:43.274
<i>Mark.</i>

13:58.560 --> 14:00.278
Nice shot, Hobbie.

14:05.480 --> 14:07.471
SABINE: Come on, Ezra.
Where are you?

14:21.680 --> 14:24.559
Sir, a rebel vessel
has entered the system.

14:26.400 --> 14:28.676
Sabine? Hope we're not
too late.

14:29.080 --> 14:31.549
SABINE: Right on time.
Come on, boys.

14:33.600 --> 14:36.638
WEDGE: Here we go.
Hobbie, Rake, on me.

14:43.440 --> 14:47.274
Four cadets have broken off from the
main group toward the rebel ship.

14:47.360 --> 14:48.998
We have our defectors.

14:49.080 --> 14:51.469
<i>PRYCE: Cadets, return
to base immediately.</i>

14:51.560 --> 14:53.517
<i>This is your only warning.</i>

14:53.600 --> 14:56.194
SABINE: Negative, Command.
You're gonna have to come and get us.

15:01.960 --> 15:03.189
(BEEPS)

15:05.200 --> 15:06.395
SABINE: We've lost power!

15:06.480 --> 15:08.551
Our fighters were rigged!

15:12.280 --> 15:14.635
Captain, destroy
one of the pods.

15:18.240 --> 15:19.310
WEDGE: Rake!

15:19.400 --> 15:21.994
Now, target
the rebel transport.

15:28.840 --> 15:31.275
SABINE: Ezra! Abort!
Get outta here!

15:31.360 --> 15:33.510
No, Sabine!
We're coming for you.

15:35.800 --> 15:37.791
(CHOPPER GRUNTING)

15:37.880 --> 15:39.996
We can't take
another hit like that.

15:40.080 --> 15:41.798
We're not
leaving her behind!

15:44.920 --> 15:46.718
We don't have
a choice, Ezra!

15:46.840 --> 15:48.478
We can't help her
if we're dead.

15:48.560 --> 15:50.870
Chopper, get us
into hyperspace now!

16:04.200 --> 16:07.079
I have so many questions.

16:07.160 --> 16:11.393
But first, I would like
to know which of you is the rebel agent.

16:13.520 --> 16:15.079
Do you know
what this is?

16:15.200 --> 16:20.354
It's most effective at extracting
information from the noncompliant.

16:22.360 --> 16:23.634
You.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.957
(GRUNTS)

16:31.040 --> 16:32.997
No, wait! It's me.

16:33.080 --> 16:34.832
I'm the rebel.

16:34.920 --> 16:36.399
Sabine, don't!

16:38.440 --> 16:40.351
And now we have a name.

16:40.520 --> 16:41.555
Thanks.

16:41.640 --> 16:43.517
Blast it. Sorry.

16:43.600 --> 16:46.797
Agent Kallus,
escort these two back to their cell.

16:46.880 --> 16:49.713
Sabine and I have
a lot to talk about.

16:51.360 --> 16:54.398
Looks like they found someone
who can do your job.

16:57.040 --> 16:58.678
I won't talk.

16:58.760 --> 17:03.038
Well, let's see how far we can
get without you needing to.

17:03.120 --> 17:05.634
Sabine Wren, is it?

17:05.720 --> 17:10.271
You are far too versed in Imperial
protocol not to have been a cadet.

17:10.359 --> 17:13.512
And now you've come home,
little Mandalorian.

17:13.599 --> 17:17.309
So proud.
And tough, I think.

17:17.400 --> 17:18.435
We shall see.

17:25.280 --> 17:27.396
We have to do something.

17:27.480 --> 17:29.118
And end up like Rake?

17:29.200 --> 17:31.669
What the Empire has planned
for us has gotta be worse.

17:31.760 --> 17:32.909
Sabine came here
to get us out.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.037
We owe her.
We have to try.

17:35.120 --> 17:36.838
So what's your plan?

17:36.920 --> 17:39.389
I'll tell you
when I figure it out.

17:48.440 --> 17:50.431
(GRUNTING)

17:51.640 --> 17:53.278
Huh. Not bad.

17:53.640 --> 17:55.358
The Empire
taught me well.

17:55.440 --> 17:56.953
(SHOUTS)

18:02.480 --> 18:04.790
My clan
taught me better.

18:04.920 --> 18:06.399
(SHOUTS)

18:06.560 --> 18:07.880
-(ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)
-(GROANING)

18:16.400 --> 18:18.073
Maybe we can surprise
the guards.

18:18.200 --> 18:19.838
What, with our
lack of planning?

18:19.920 --> 18:21.115
Well, why don't you
think of something!

18:21.240 --> 18:22.389
(DOOR OPENS)

18:22.480 --> 18:24.835
I hope you're better pilots
than you are soldiers.

18:24.920 --> 18:27.719
Sabine. We were coming
to rescue you.

18:27.800 --> 18:30.269
That's cute.
Come on. Let's go.

18:42.200 --> 18:43.429
Don't shoot.

18:43.520 --> 18:45.238
Give me a good reason
not to.

18:45.320 --> 18:47.391
Avoid levels
three through five.

18:47.520 --> 18:50.956
Hangar 24 is
your best possibility.

18:53.920 --> 18:56.639
Wait. Why should
we trust you?

18:57.440 --> 19:00.671
Tell Garazeb Orrelios
we're even.

19:04.720 --> 19:06.233
Go.

19:13.160 --> 19:14.639
That tub?
Are you kidding?

19:14.720 --> 19:17.473
Hey, it can take a hit.
Now, can you fly it or not?

19:17.560 --> 19:18.880
I can fly anything.

19:18.960 --> 19:21.031
Freeze! Don't move!

19:24.080 --> 19:25.354
(BEEPING)

19:35.080 --> 19:36.593
Young fools.

19:43.400 --> 19:45.630
Fighter closing fast! .6!

19:45.720 --> 19:47.279
That's gotta be Skerris.

19:53.400 --> 19:55.152
Wedge, can't you
go any faster?

19:55.240 --> 19:56.958
I told you
this thing was slow!

20:02.360 --> 20:03.998
Where are those friends
of yours?

20:04.080 --> 20:06.356
I can't signal.
Comms are jammed.

20:15.560 --> 20:18.200
SABINE: (SHOUTING)
Whoa!

20:31.200 --> 20:33.510
EZRA: (OVER COMLINK) Sabine?
We knew you'd come through.

20:33.600 --> 20:36.240
Ugh. Never been so happy
to hear your voice.

20:36.320 --> 20:38.118
Get to
the docking port, quick.

20:38.400 --> 20:40.232
(ENGINE SPUTTERING)

20:54.920 --> 20:56.069
Thought I told you
to leave.

20:56.160 --> 20:57.673
We stuck around,
just in case.

20:57.760 --> 20:59.637
(BEEPING)

21:12.640 --> 21:14.711
Commander Sato,
allow me to present

21:14.800 --> 21:18.316
Lieutenants Wedge Antilles
and... Hobbie.

21:18.400 --> 21:20.914
Formerly of
the Galactic Empire.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.071
Commander, we heard
you're looking for some good pilots.

21:23.160 --> 21:26.994
Indeed, we are.
Welcome to the Rebellion.
