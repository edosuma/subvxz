00:00.017 --> 00:01.668
Previously on "Legends of Tomorrow..."

00:01.671 --> 00:03.270
The more the timeline's corrupted,

00:03.273 --> 00:05.297
the weaker the prison
holding Mallus becomes.

00:05.300 --> 00:07.465
Maybe these totems are
the keys to stopping him.

00:07.468 --> 00:09.342
The Fire Totem wasn't meant for me.

00:09.344 --> 00:11.678
Damien Darhk, what has he promised you?

00:11.680 --> 00:13.479
A chance to protect our village.

00:13.481 --> 00:15.081
- No.
- We'll fix this.

00:15.083 --> 00:16.215
We'll get your totem back.

00:16.216 --> 00:17.989
Gideon, delete file 354-Z.

00:17.992 --> 00:19.352
Yes, Director Hunter.

00:19.354 --> 00:21.788
Sara can never find
out the truth about Ava.

00:21.790 --> 00:24.023
- Look, I don't deserve you.
- Sara, yes you do.

00:24.025 --> 00:25.458
No, Ava, I don't.

00:25.460 --> 00:28.127
I'm not gonna do this. I'm sorry.

00:33.835 --> 00:36.669
I am not just walking
out on the team, Ray.

00:36.671 --> 00:38.705
She says, as she's
literally walking away.

00:38.707 --> 00:40.540
Sara, we appreciate
that you may need a break

00:40.542 --> 00:42.108
after what happened
with the Death Totem.

00:42.110 --> 00:44.043
But this is the absolute
worst time for you to leave.

00:44.045 --> 00:45.812
At least let us lock you up in the brig.

00:45.814 --> 00:47.280
We need you here now mor.

00:47.282 --> 00:48.881
Yeah, we've almost won the totem race.

00:48.883 --> 00:50.717
Which is exactly why I need to go.

00:50.719 --> 00:53.553
Look, we are so close to
gaining control over "the six."

00:53.555 --> 00:55.188
and getting the upper hand on Mallus.

00:55.190 --> 00:56.689
I just...

00:56.691 --> 00:58.989
I need a day to clear my head.

00:58.992 --> 01:00.458
Yeah, but who's gonna
stop Mick from burning down

01:00.460 --> 01:01.479
the ship with the Fire Totem?

01:01.481 --> 01:02.995
Someone's gonna have to fill in the role

01:02.997 --> 01:04.629
of captain while I'm gone.

01:04.632 --> 01:07.120
Oh, well, uh, I hadn't
exactly thought I'd...

01:07.123 --> 01:08.835
I'd pick up the mantle this soon, but...

01:08.837 --> 01:10.370
I'm putting Amaya in charge.

01:12.429 --> 01:14.596
Good luck.

01:14.599 --> 01:17.200
Sorry about that, big guy.

01:19.000 --> 01:25.074

01:27.895 --> 01:29.695
Hey, hi, um,

01:29.698 --> 01:32.959
do you think that maybe you
could do that somewhere else?

01:32.961 --> 01:34.494
We do have a galley.

01:34.496 --> 01:36.262
You want a dog?

01:36.264 --> 01:37.530
It's pork.

01:37.532 --> 01:40.032
So what?

01:40.035 --> 01:42.369
No, thank you.

01:47.542 --> 01:49.542
Wow, I'm sure that's
what those ancient folks

01:49.544 --> 01:51.577
had in mind when they
created the Fire Totem.

01:51.579 --> 01:54.847
- Every man's gotta eat.
- There you are, Mick.

01:54.849 --> 01:56.082
You ready?

01:56.084 --> 01:57.717
- For what?
- Training.

01:57.719 --> 01:58.909
Do you remember?

01:58.912 --> 02:00.420
We spoke about learning
to harness the powers

02:00.422 --> 02:02.755
- of the totem.
- Hmm.

02:02.757 --> 02:04.090
I got a new trick.

02:04.092 --> 02:05.324
Pull my finger.

02:05.326 --> 02:07.794
- What?
- Pull my finger.

02:07.796 --> 02:09.628
Do not pull his finger.

02:09.631 --> 02:11.901
Let's just say hot dogs aren't
the only thing he's learned

02:11.903 --> 02:13.199
how to light on fire.

02:13.201 --> 02:14.895
Sorry to interrupt, Ms. Jiwe,

02:14.898 --> 02:17.537
but Dr. Heywood requests
your presence in the library.

02:17.539 --> 02:21.741
Captain's duties are never over.

02:21.743 --> 02:24.410
But, seeing as you're not busy...

02:24.412 --> 02:26.356
No, no, no, please don't...
Please don't ask me.

02:26.359 --> 02:28.403
I can't think of anyone
better to learn to train

02:28.406 --> 02:31.607
a new totem bearer.

02:31.610 --> 02:33.419
Yeah, sure.

02:33.421 --> 02:35.121
I'll get right on it.

02:35.123 --> 02:36.756
Good luck.

02:45.266 --> 02:46.566
So, what's going on?

02:46.568 --> 02:48.197
It's your granddaughter, Mari.

02:48.200 --> 02:49.302
She's been hurt.

02:49.304 --> 02:51.173
A minor wrinkle in the 2018 timeline.

02:51.176 --> 02:52.238
How badly?

02:52.240 --> 02:54.073
The article says she was
burned trying to save people

02:54.075 --> 02:55.770
from a warehouse fire in Detroit.

02:55.773 --> 02:57.840
Doesn't she have superpowers, though?

02:57.843 --> 02:59.512
This is all my fault.

02:59.514 --> 03:00.880
Ever since I lost my totem,

03:00.882 --> 03:03.115
the timeline must be
starting to solidify.

03:03.117 --> 03:05.084
Which means, in this new reality,

03:05.086 --> 03:06.652
the totem was never passed down to her.

03:06.654 --> 03:09.355
So Mari is a vigilante
without her totem.

03:09.357 --> 03:11.023
- I have to go and talk to her.
- What?

03:11.025 --> 03:13.626
No, you cannot talk to
your own granddaughter.

03:13.628 --> 03:15.228
- That will cause...
- Unforeseen consequences.

03:15.230 --> 03:17.163
I know, but how much
worse can things truly get?

03:18.725 --> 03:20.892
Sara put me in charge
while she steps away.

03:20.895 --> 03:23.369
All the more reason why
you should stay on the ship.

03:23.371 --> 03:25.872
Okay? I'll go to Detroit,
and I'll talk to her.

03:25.874 --> 03:28.374
- And I'll, uh... I'll help him.
- Yeah.

03:28.376 --> 03:31.878
There's nothing this
dynamic duo cannot do.

03:31.880 --> 03:33.479
Okay, fine.

03:33.481 --> 03:36.616
Just be careful.

03:39.621 --> 03:42.288
Look, Sara, for what it's worth,

03:42.290 --> 03:44.276
I know it wasn't the real
you who tried to kill us.

03:44.278 --> 03:47.026
That's just it, Ray.
That was the real me.

03:47.028 --> 03:50.062
Which is why I need to...

03:50.064 --> 03:52.398
Ms. Lance? It's Gary.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.400
Sorry to drop in on you like this.

03:54.402 --> 03:56.969
What're you doing? Open your eyes, Gary.

03:56.971 --> 03:58.738
Oh, hi.

03:58.740 --> 04:00.940
Sorry, I didn't wanna
accidentally portal

04:00.942 --> 04:02.742
into your quarters and catch
you and Director Sharpe,

04:02.744 --> 04:04.110
you know...

04:04.112 --> 04:05.551
together.

04:05.554 --> 04:07.221
Well, you don't have to
worry about that anymore

04:07.223 --> 04:08.681
because we broke up.

04:08.683 --> 04:09.868
Wait, what?

04:09.871 --> 04:10.950
Why didn't you tell us?

04:10.952 --> 04:12.318
No, no, you guys can't break up.

04:12.320 --> 04:14.051
I was shipping you so hard.

04:14.054 --> 04:15.321
That's why you're leaving.

04:15.323 --> 04:17.589
That is not why I'm leaving.

04:17.591 --> 04:20.415
And if you're looking for Ava,
I suggest you check her office.

04:20.418 --> 04:21.594
Uh, well, that's the thing.

04:21.596 --> 04:22.885
She hasn't been to work in a few days,

04:22.887 --> 04:24.454
which is very unlike her.

04:24.457 --> 04:25.721
I've already been covering for her,

04:25.723 --> 04:27.033
I forged her signature twice.

04:27.035 --> 04:29.135
What am I supposed to do
next? Put on a wig and pantsuit

04:29.137 --> 04:30.736
and pretend I'm her?

04:30.738 --> 04:33.158
- No, don't do that.
- What if she's in trouble?

04:33.161 --> 04:34.640
I mean, we already
lost Director Bennett.

04:34.642 --> 04:36.742
What if Grodd got to her
too? Oh, my God, oh, my God...

04:36.744 --> 04:40.379
Gary, Gary, deep breaths. Deep breaths.

04:40.381 --> 04:41.847
Don't worry, Gary.

04:43.284 --> 04:44.850
Because we're gonna find her.

04:44.852 --> 04:47.253
"We" will find her?

04:49.020 --> 04:53.931

-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

04:55.964 --> 04:58.564
Thanks for taking the time
to talk with us, Mr. McCabe.

04:58.566 --> 05:00.322
Mari's resting.

05:00.325 --> 05:03.436
I'll have someone come
grab you when she wakes up.

05:03.438 --> 05:05.037
We're from "The Detroit Chronicle"

05:05.039 --> 05:06.272
and we'd like to do a story

05:06.274 --> 05:08.384
about your foster daughter's heroism.

05:08.387 --> 05:09.832
To tell you the truth,

05:09.835 --> 05:12.444
I wish she was less interested
in saving everyone else's lives

05:12.447 --> 05:14.246
and more compelled to protect her own.

05:14.248 --> 05:15.770
Mari's a brave woman.

05:15.773 --> 05:17.984
But maybe you should remind
her that there are police

05:17.987 --> 05:19.083
and firefighters too.

05:19.086 --> 05:21.462
And that the safety of
Detroit isn't, you know,

05:21.465 --> 05:22.954
her responsibility.

05:22.957 --> 05:24.246
You don't have to tell me that.

05:24.249 --> 05:25.782
Sometimes I feel like my daughter,

05:25.785 --> 05:28.627
she's walking around
with a target on her back.

05:30.331 --> 05:31.497
Excuse me for a second.

05:41.309 --> 05:42.642
If Ava comes back and finds us

05:42.645 --> 05:43.976
snooping through her office...

05:43.978 --> 05:46.712
We're only snooping to
find out where she went.

05:50.852 --> 05:52.184
What're you doing?

05:52.186 --> 05:53.953
I am hacking into the Bureau's network

05:53.955 --> 05:56.589
to access Ava's personnel file.

05:57.792 --> 05:59.582
- Huh.
- What is it?

05:59.585 --> 06:01.861
Director Sharpe's personnel
file has been erased.

06:01.863 --> 06:04.163
Someone deleted it
remotely from the Waverider.

06:04.165 --> 06:06.965
Wow, she must've really
wanted to go off the radar.

06:06.968 --> 06:09.259
Wait, you think Director
Sharpe erased her own file?

06:09.262 --> 06:10.569
That's crazy.

06:10.571 --> 06:11.904
Yeah, so is putting on a wig

06:11.906 --> 06:13.606
and impersonating your boss, Gary.

06:13.608 --> 06:15.441
I didn't actually do it.

06:15.443 --> 06:17.309
- Mm-hmm.
- What are you doing?

06:17.311 --> 06:20.413
Looking for clues as to
where she might've gone.

06:20.415 --> 06:24.684
Birthday card from
her parents in Fresno.

06:24.686 --> 06:26.762
Think she might've gone to Fresno?

06:26.765 --> 06:29.354
Does that mean we have to go to Fresno?

06:29.357 --> 06:31.857
- You're sure you saw Kuasa?
- Yeah.

06:31.859 --> 06:35.061
Just be on the lookout for
a badass in a leather outfit.

06:35.063 --> 06:37.063
Or a suspicious puddle of water.

06:38.666 --> 06:40.066
There she is!

06:40.068 --> 06:41.834
I got her.

06:47.484 --> 06:49.575
Dude, don't just stand there.

06:58.986 --> 07:00.586
Hello.

07:03.291 --> 07:05.191
Not so fast.

07:05.193 --> 07:07.993
- Wally, wait, she's...
- Dangerous, I know.

07:07.995 --> 07:09.929
Ah, as soon as I catch my breath,

07:09.931 --> 07:11.997
we're gonna stop you
from hurting your sister.

07:11.999 --> 07:13.432
Hurt Mari?

07:13.434 --> 07:16.102
I'm here to protect her. You idiots.

07:24.175 --> 07:26.208
Well, this isn't exactly how I imagined

07:26.210 --> 07:27.910
meeting Ava's parents.

07:31.783 --> 07:34.393
Not that I imagined
meeting Ava's parents.

07:34.396 --> 07:35.618
I just, I...

07:35.620 --> 07:38.421
Hello. How can we help you?

07:38.423 --> 07:40.112
Pam and Randy Sharpe?

07:40.115 --> 07:41.882
Says so on our marriage license.

07:41.885 --> 07:44.412
Looks like they stepped right
out of an L.L. Bean catalogue.

07:44.415 --> 07:46.696
Now we know where Director
Sharpe gets her perfect

07:46.698 --> 07:47.631
bone structure.

07:47.634 --> 07:49.529
And you are?

07:49.532 --> 07:51.198
We're friends of your daughter.

07:51.201 --> 07:52.639
Well, unfortunately, Ava...

07:52.642 --> 07:54.270
Hasn't shown up for work in a few days,

07:54.272 --> 07:55.684
and we're getting a little worried.

07:55.687 --> 07:57.346
We haven't seen her in months.

07:57.349 --> 07:58.641
I hope she's okay.

07:58.643 --> 08:00.409
We were hoping that
we could come inside.

08:00.411 --> 08:03.045
Maybe together we could
figure out where she's gone.

08:03.047 --> 08:05.047
Sure. Uh, Pammy here
just baked up a storm

08:05.049 --> 08:06.682
of her famous cookies.

08:06.684 --> 08:09.418
Snickerdoodles.

08:09.420 --> 08:12.755
Come on in.

08:12.757 --> 08:14.432
If you folks work with Ava,

08:14.435 --> 08:16.425
you must work for the government.

08:16.427 --> 08:19.161
Yep, we're, uh...
We're government suits.

08:19.163 --> 08:20.644
Our daughter won't
tell us what she does.

08:20.646 --> 08:22.798
It's all so "top secret."

08:22.800 --> 08:25.468
You have so many photos of her.

08:25.470 --> 08:27.069
Where was that one taken?

08:27.071 --> 08:30.039
Oh, that's at the,
uh... The Grand Canyon.

08:30.041 --> 08:32.575
Mm.

08:32.577 --> 08:35.244
Such a beautiful family.

08:35.246 --> 08:38.365
Almost too good to be true.

08:38.368 --> 08:39.634
Sara, why don't you try one of

08:39.636 --> 08:41.184
Mrs. Sharpe's snickerdoodles?

08:41.188 --> 08:42.587
I don't want a snickerdoodle, Ray.

08:42.590 --> 08:44.720
What about this photo?

08:44.722 --> 08:46.489
- Where was this one?
- Oh, yes.

08:46.491 --> 08:48.824
That's Ava's 15th birthday party.

08:48.826 --> 08:51.127
She had friends in for a sleepover.

08:51.129 --> 08:54.163
They stayed up all night
long watching horror movies.

08:56.134 --> 08:57.767
Hah.

08:57.769 --> 08:59.635
- Sleepover, really?
- Uh-huh.

08:59.637 --> 09:02.071
I remember it well.

09:02.073 --> 09:05.541
Well, I know for a fact

09:05.543 --> 09:08.544
Ava went paintballing
for her 15th birthday.

09:08.546 --> 09:10.079
Oh.

09:10.081 --> 09:11.662
Uh, Pam meant her 16th birthday.

09:11.665 --> 09:13.127
She always gets that part mixed up.

09:13.130 --> 09:14.550
Always.

09:14.552 --> 09:15.718
- Oh.
- Ah.

09:15.720 --> 09:17.190
Who the hell are you guys?

09:17.193 --> 09:18.566
Oh, God, I hate the sight of blood.

09:18.568 --> 09:19.822
- Sara.
- Okay, fine!

09:19.824 --> 09:21.724
We'll tell you everything,
just don't kill us.

09:21.726 --> 09:24.498
- Why the hell shouldn't I?
- Because we're just actors.

09:25.740 --> 09:27.857
- What?
- Yeah, yeah, uh, okay.

09:27.860 --> 09:30.174
Four years ago, we responded
to this online ad for a gig.

09:30.177 --> 09:31.600
They gave us backstories
for our characters.

09:31.602 --> 09:33.369
They told us if Ava ever
comes around to visit,

09:33.371 --> 09:34.657
we just act like her parents.

09:34.660 --> 09:37.005
- And who hired you?
- No idea.

09:37.008 --> 09:39.141
The money is automatically deposited.

09:39.143 --> 09:40.776
Look, it... it's not such a bad gig,

09:40.778 --> 09:42.838
considering Ava rarely
ever comes home to visit.

09:42.841 --> 09:44.362
Why in the world would you agree to be

09:44.365 --> 09:45.781
a part of such a charade?

09:45.783 --> 09:50.453
Do you know how hard it is to
get an acting job in Fresno?

09:50.455 --> 09:53.556
Right, well, I apologize
about the knife thing.

09:53.558 --> 09:55.157
It is a gut reaction.

09:55.159 --> 09:56.592
Nothing personal.

09:56.594 --> 09:58.828
Sorry to bother you.
We'll be on our way now.

09:58.830 --> 10:00.896
You have a lovely home, Mr. and Mrs.

10:00.898 --> 10:03.332
Whatever your real names are.

10:06.971 --> 10:10.406
Okay, you said to wait until
after your second lunch.

10:10.408 --> 10:12.041
This is your fourth.

10:12.043 --> 10:14.610
Amaya wants me to teach
you how to use your totem,

10:14.612 --> 10:17.079
so let's get cracking.

10:17.081 --> 10:19.882
If I wanted to learn, I
would've gone to school.

10:19.884 --> 10:21.350
You know, you are ri...

10:23.554 --> 10:25.254
Okay.

10:25.256 --> 10:29.325
Be patient, be kind, abstain
from negative thoughts.

10:29.327 --> 10:31.460
Sorry, blood-sugar thing.

10:31.462 --> 10:32.795
Fasting.

10:32.797 --> 10:35.664
- Fasting?
- Yeah, I'm not eating.

10:35.666 --> 10:38.234
Trying to lose some fat, huh?

10:38.236 --> 10:41.174
No, I love my body. I'm
trying to observe Ramadan.

10:41.177 --> 10:44.673
So observe it on a full stomach.

10:44.675 --> 10:46.146
Ah.

10:50.771 --> 10:52.047
Is this bacon?

10:52.049 --> 10:53.616
You Jewish?

10:54.385 --> 10:55.651
I don't even know what...

10:55.653 --> 10:57.086
I can't.

11:01.592 --> 11:05.302
What kind of person invents
a fake family and backstory?

11:05.305 --> 11:06.996
Well, when I was a
kid, I told my friends

11:06.998 --> 11:08.697
my dad was an orthodontist.

11:08.699 --> 11:10.566
It sounded much cooler than dentist.

11:10.568 --> 11:12.067
If she was lying about where she's from,

11:12.069 --> 11:13.936
there's no telling what else she...

11:15.640 --> 11:18.240
Sara. What're you doing here?

11:18.242 --> 11:21.190
Uh, Gary was worried

11:21.193 --> 11:22.599
that you were missing,

11:22.602 --> 11:24.612
so naturally, we were concerned

11:24.615 --> 11:26.958
and thought we'd investigate it further.

11:26.961 --> 11:29.662
Well, clearly I'm no
longer missing, so...

11:29.665 --> 11:31.146
You sure you're okay?

11:31.149 --> 11:32.448
I'm fine.

11:32.451 --> 11:34.418
Don't I look fine?

11:34.421 --> 11:35.958
Where have you been?

11:35.960 --> 11:37.760
If you must know, I...

11:37.762 --> 11:39.395
Gary, straighten your tie.

11:39.397 --> 11:41.030
I was visiting my parents in Fresno.

11:41.032 --> 11:42.398
Home-cooked meals and all.

11:42.400 --> 11:44.190
- Hmm, Fresno?
- Mm-hmm.

11:44.193 --> 11:45.121
Mm.

11:45.124 --> 11:46.724
Nothing like a tray of snickerdoodles.

11:46.727 --> 11:48.737
Well, I mean, any other
kind of cookie to, um,

11:48.740 --> 11:49.966
mend a broken heart.

11:49.969 --> 11:51.470
You know what? I have
a lot of work to do.

11:51.472 --> 11:53.622
I'm sure you two can see yourselves out.

11:57.615 --> 11:59.114
You're okay?

11:59.116 --> 12:00.749
No one likes running into their ex.

12:00.751 --> 12:02.518
I'm fine.

12:02.520 --> 12:04.286
And like I said,

12:04.288 --> 12:07.556
let's find out what else
she's hiding from us.

12:15.700 --> 12:18.434
So this is Mari's Vixen Cave.

12:18.436 --> 12:20.569
Ever since my grandmother
lost her totem,

12:20.571 --> 12:23.505
I figured I'd better
start keeping tabs on her.

12:23.507 --> 12:25.174
It's a good thing I did.

12:25.176 --> 12:26.742
I thought you hated Mari.

12:28.112 --> 12:29.872
She's still my sister.

12:29.875 --> 12:31.213
And even though I resented her

12:31.215 --> 12:33.949
for inheriting the Anansi Totem,

12:33.951 --> 12:37.018
I'd rather see it around her
neck than on Nora Darhk's.

12:37.021 --> 12:39.822
So let's get it back
to where it belongs.

12:39.824 --> 12:41.423
You wanna help me?

12:41.425 --> 12:43.626
We wanna help Amaya. You
wanna help your sister.

12:43.628 --> 12:45.794
Either way, we have
to get that totem back.

12:45.796 --> 12:47.630
The Darhks will kill
me if I turn on them.

12:47.632 --> 12:49.665
Don't worry, this isn't the
first totem that we've lifted

12:49.667 --> 12:50.799
from under their noses.

12:50.801 --> 12:52.434
Soon we'll have five totems.

12:52.436 --> 12:54.411
Do you really wanna be one against five?

12:54.414 --> 12:57.190
If we work together, we can
defeat the Darhks and Mallus.

12:57.193 --> 12:59.708
And you get to protect your family.

12:59.710 --> 13:01.529
Isn't that what you really want?

13:03.147 --> 13:06.548
Fine. But we do this my way.

13:09.520 --> 13:12.087
Maybe Ava wasn't lying
about where she was,

13:12.089 --> 13:15.057
but when she was.

13:15.059 --> 13:17.860
I thought the worst thing
about her is she's from Fresno.

13:17.862 --> 13:19.795
Well, I'm not...

13:19.797 --> 13:22.131
I'm not seeing anything
in her Time Courier records

13:22.133 --> 13:24.018
that wasn't Bureau-sanctioned
and by-the-book.

13:24.021 --> 13:25.634
Wait. What's that?

13:25.636 --> 13:27.279
Uh, her first mission.

13:27.282 --> 13:28.987
Vancouver, 2213.

13:28.990 --> 13:30.439
I can't access it.

13:30.441 --> 13:33.190
The Bureau has sanctioned
2213 a no-fly zone.

13:33.193 --> 13:34.349
Meaning?

13:34.352 --> 13:35.932
Meaning, the Courier you stole from Ava

13:35.935 --> 13:37.046
doesn't do you any good,

13:37.048 --> 13:38.781
and the Waverider
can't fly there either.

13:38.783 --> 13:41.411
The only person who can
override the restriction...

13:41.414 --> 13:43.117
Is a Time Bureau Director.

13:43.120 --> 13:44.386
Yeah.

13:44.388 --> 13:45.721
But why wouldn't Director Sharpe...

13:45.723 --> 13:47.271
Want us to know who she really is?

13:47.274 --> 13:49.013
I'll give you one guess, Gary.

13:50.661 --> 13:52.361
Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God.

13:52.363 --> 13:54.129
You think my boss is an Anachronism?

13:54.131 --> 13:56.899
The only way to know for
sure is to go to 2213.

13:56.901 --> 13:58.701
- So how do we get there?
- I...

13:58.703 --> 14:01.103
I guess the only way would
be to hijack the mother ship,

14:01.105 --> 14:03.072
but unfortunately I
failed flight training.

14:03.074 --> 14:04.606
Damn astigmatism.

14:04.608 --> 14:06.675
Like I'd let you fly.

14:08.312 --> 14:09.745
Let's go.

14:09.747 --> 14:11.447
Wha... what?

14:18.789 --> 14:20.856
What do you mean, the
mother ship is on the move?

14:20.858 --> 14:22.858
I mean, someone's stealing it, ma'am.

14:22.860 --> 14:25.260
Track it. I'm going after it personally.

14:31.735 --> 14:33.438
Should we really be doing this?

14:33.441 --> 14:35.738
I mean, I'm... I'm sure
there's a good reason why no one

14:35.740 --> 14:37.306
is supposed to come to this time period.

14:37.308 --> 14:38.841
Maybe Gary's right.

14:38.843 --> 14:40.175
Maybe we should just ask Ava

14:40.177 --> 14:41.610
what her connection is to this place.

14:41.612 --> 14:43.846
Why? She's just gonna lie to us again.

14:45.416 --> 14:47.816
Well, if you wanna ask
her, now's your chance.

14:48.798 --> 14:50.464
Director Sharpe.

14:55.059 --> 14:57.459
Director Sh... Sharpe?

15:00.464 --> 15:02.264
Just down across, and make a left.

15:05.102 --> 15:07.436
Director Sharpes?

15:07.438 --> 15:09.972
What kind of world is this?

15:09.974 --> 15:11.707
Paradise?

15:13.294 --> 15:15.940
I'm surrounded by my exes, Gary.

15:18.048 --> 15:19.779
This is hell.

15:26.690 --> 15:28.590
Pleasant day, citizens.

15:30.094 --> 15:32.564
I had a dream like this once.

15:32.566 --> 15:35.567
Yeah, me too, but mine
involved less clothing.

15:35.569 --> 15:37.169
Mine too.

15:37.171 --> 15:39.204
Okay.

15:39.206 --> 15:42.656
Well, I guess this is why they
declared 2213 a no-fly zone.

15:42.659 --> 15:44.425
Director Sharpe didn't
want us to find out

15:44.428 --> 15:46.044
that she's secretly a robot.

15:46.046 --> 15:48.647
I did not have sex with a robot.

15:48.649 --> 15:52.117
No, you didn't, Sara,
you had sex with a clone.

15:52.119 --> 15:54.252
Here at Advanced Variant Automation,

15:54.254 --> 15:56.588
we are working to
bring a brighter future.

15:56.590 --> 15:59.357
Our cloning program
has produced the AVA.

15:59.359 --> 16:01.891
AVA is the perfect woman
designed to keep us safe

16:01.894 --> 16:03.794
and restore order to the chaos.

16:03.797 --> 16:05.864
It makes sense they'd clone Ava.

16:05.867 --> 16:07.500
She is the perfect woman.

16:07.503 --> 16:10.468
Oh, calm down, Gary. She's... okay.

16:10.471 --> 16:12.461
Before I have an Ava overload,

16:12.464 --> 16:14.205
should we return to
the comfort and safety

16:14.208 --> 16:16.208
of the Time Bureau?

16:16.210 --> 16:17.576
No.

16:19.323 --> 16:21.823
we're not done here yet.

16:24.692 --> 16:27.693
I think an ambush would
work best in this situation.

16:27.696 --> 16:29.254
Sure.

16:29.256 --> 16:31.356
If you wanna die a quick death.

16:31.358 --> 16:32.791
Quite frankly, you two...

16:33.994 --> 16:35.494
Whoa.

16:35.496 --> 16:37.462
Are no match for the Darhks.

16:37.464 --> 16:38.851
Okay.

16:38.854 --> 16:39.920
So what's your plan?

16:39.923 --> 16:41.555
We lure them to us.

16:41.558 --> 16:43.625
- With bait.
- No, no.

16:43.628 --> 16:45.370
You are not using a totem.

16:45.372 --> 16:46.828
No.

16:46.831 --> 16:48.231
We have the next best thing.

16:48.234 --> 16:50.567
- A legend.
- Wait, that's crazy.

16:50.570 --> 16:52.104
Why don't we just go
to where they're at,

16:52.106 --> 16:53.673
I'll swipe it like I did the Fire Totem.

16:53.675 --> 16:55.575
You overplayed your hand.

16:55.578 --> 16:58.742
Now they know you have a...
Whatever you are on the team.

16:58.745 --> 17:00.753
What I am is the fastest man alive.

17:00.756 --> 17:02.288
- Thanks.
- Second fastest.

17:02.290 --> 17:04.057
Shh, she didn't need to know that.

17:04.059 --> 17:06.393
Nathaniel?

17:06.395 --> 17:07.965
Amaya, hey.

17:07.969 --> 17:09.161
How's Mari?

17:09.164 --> 17:10.723
The doctor says she's gonna be fine.

17:10.726 --> 17:12.832
She's strong, just like you.

17:12.834 --> 17:14.613
Thank you for checking in on her.

17:14.616 --> 17:16.115
So when are you coming back?

17:16.117 --> 17:17.984
Um, we're gonna stick
around for a while.

17:17.988 --> 17:20.053
You know, talk her out of
this whole superhero business.

17:20.055 --> 17:22.036
Or at least until you
get your totem back,

17:22.039 --> 17:23.708
and the timelines back in order.

17:23.711 --> 17:27.747
In that case, just take
care of yourself, okay?

17:27.749 --> 17:29.398
I love you, Nathaniel.

17:31.386 --> 17:33.286
Yeah, me too.

17:33.288 --> 17:36.923
Um, shouldn't we be
bringing Amaya into this?

17:36.925 --> 17:38.734
No.

17:38.737 --> 17:41.260
We already have one Vixen
in the hospital as it is.

17:41.263 --> 17:42.422
Agreed.

17:42.425 --> 17:44.329
My grandmother will
want to play the hero

17:44.332 --> 17:46.299
and get herself killed.

17:46.301 --> 17:49.669
If that happens, Mari and I
will be wiped from existence.

17:49.671 --> 17:51.271
Right, so we're gonna
need you to keep her

17:51.273 --> 17:52.672
out of our hair.

17:52.674 --> 17:53.966
- But I...
- I know, I know.

17:53.969 --> 17:55.141
I'll be fine.

17:55.143 --> 17:56.976
I just need you to keep an eye on Amaya.

18:03.518 --> 18:05.492
Damn it, Wally.

18:16.364 --> 18:18.098
This place is creepy.

18:18.100 --> 18:20.366
How about I wait outside?

18:20.368 --> 18:22.268
How about you calm down?

18:23.238 --> 18:25.005
Is it too late to
mention my fear of things

18:25.008 --> 18:26.573
covered in sheets?

18:26.575 --> 18:29.342
Hey, guys. Over here.

18:38.820 --> 18:40.854
How is this even possible?

18:40.856 --> 18:43.923
Looks like they created
Ava from what they believe

18:43.925 --> 18:45.792
are the best genes from around the world

18:45.794 --> 18:47.360
to make the perfect woman.

18:47.362 --> 18:49.996
Though, she's a little
pale, if you ask me.

18:49.998 --> 18:53.433
I should've known she
was too good to be true.

18:54.603 --> 18:57.103
That doesn't mean that what
you guys had wasn't real.

18:59.341 --> 19:00.773
That is exactly what it means.

19:00.775 --> 19:01.953
Uh, guys.

19:01.956 --> 19:03.356
Everything that she's
told me about herself

19:03.358 --> 19:04.461
- has been a lie.
- Guys.

19:04.464 --> 19:06.912
What, Gary?

19:06.915 --> 19:09.382
Oh, crumbs, I think I woke one up.

19:09.384 --> 19:11.484
You are in violation of bylaw 575.

19:11.486 --> 19:13.453
You do not have clearance
to be in this room.

19:13.455 --> 19:15.321
We were just leaving.

19:17.603 --> 19:19.792
Just let us go, it'll be fine.

19:19.794 --> 19:21.995
If I let you go, I
have to let everyone go.

19:21.997 --> 19:23.624
You must be terminated.

19:23.627 --> 19:25.298
Uh, I think she wants to kill us.

19:25.300 --> 19:26.599
You don't say.

19:28.970 --> 19:30.265
Should we help?

19:30.268 --> 19:32.005
Uh, not unless you want
both of them to kill you.

19:36.077 --> 19:38.778
All right, tie her up,
before she comes to.

19:41.816 --> 19:43.116
This is weird.

19:43.118 --> 19:45.118
Ah.

19:45.120 --> 19:47.187
These chains won't be
nearly as convincing

19:47.189 --> 19:49.722
if you can turn to steel.

19:49.724 --> 19:51.991
You know, I'm a good
actor. I could've sold it.

19:54.029 --> 19:55.562
And what's with these vigilantes

19:55.564 --> 19:57.230
and their dark spaces?

19:57.232 --> 19:59.894
It's like they're afraid
of that healthy bronze look.

19:59.897 --> 20:01.668
Hmm?

20:01.670 --> 20:04.237
Oh, I... I didn't mean you.

20:04.239 --> 20:06.306
I... you look great, honey. You...

20:06.308 --> 20:08.975
I underestimated you, Kuasa.

20:08.977 --> 20:11.377
You brought us a
valuable bargaining chip.

20:11.379 --> 20:12.512
Uh-uh.

20:12.514 --> 20:14.714
I want something in exchange.

20:14.716 --> 20:16.182
My grandmother's totem.

20:16.184 --> 20:17.597
It belongs to me.

20:17.600 --> 20:18.918
You didn't actually think

20:18.920 --> 20:20.820
she was gonna hand that
over to you, did you?

20:20.822 --> 20:22.722
- She's right.
- You what?

20:22.724 --> 20:25.191
The power of Mallus flows through me.

20:25.193 --> 20:28.795
I don't need some trinket.

20:28.797 --> 20:33.543
Besides, Kuasa has proven
herself a loyal acolyte.

20:36.371 --> 20:38.972
The plan worked. Free me.

20:38.974 --> 20:41.541
I once thought that losing this totem

20:41.543 --> 20:44.844
was the greatest threat
to me and my family.

20:44.846 --> 20:47.947
But you are in love with my Nana Baa.

20:47.949 --> 20:51.017
And should she choose
to love you in return,

20:51.019 --> 20:53.387
me and my sister will never even exist.

20:53.390 --> 20:55.695
- This is not the plan.
- Plans change.

20:55.698 --> 20:58.099
This is better than
"The Brave and the Bold."

20:58.102 --> 21:00.269
For a PhD, you're remarkably gullible.

21:00.272 --> 21:02.695
Oh, Kuasa, you're better than this.

21:02.697 --> 21:05.265
Be the woman your grandmother
believes you to be.

21:06.635 --> 21:10.336
I'm being the woman she knows me to be.

21:16.044 --> 21:19.311
When you kill him, do it slowly.

21:28.981 --> 21:30.013
Is that too tight?

21:30.015 --> 21:31.167
I can never tell.

21:31.170 --> 21:32.816
Not... That I have experience

21:32.818 --> 21:34.417
tying people up, 'cause I-I-I don't...

21:34.419 --> 21:36.653
Stop talking to it, Gary.

21:36.655 --> 21:38.785
Sara, she isn't an it.

21:38.788 --> 21:40.490
She's a real person.

21:40.492 --> 21:41.958
They all are.

21:41.960 --> 21:44.828
Our Ava is just an
anachronism somehow displaced

21:44.830 --> 21:47.164
200 years in the past, AKA our present.

21:47.166 --> 21:49.800
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.
- I know. I... I mean, I get it.

21:49.802 --> 21:52.202
Why would she tell me
she comes from a place

21:52.204 --> 21:54.638
where's she's just one
of a million copies?

21:57.678 --> 21:58.911
There you are.

21:58.914 --> 22:00.497
Oh, God, another one?

22:00.500 --> 22:02.333
Gary, that's our Ava.

22:02.336 --> 22:03.802
What does he mean "another one"?

22:04.512 --> 22:05.711
Don't mind Gary.

22:06.425 --> 22:08.684
You know, it's interesting,
I would've found you sooner,

22:08.687 --> 22:11.808
except I seem to have
misplaced my Time Courier.

22:11.811 --> 22:13.944
What are you three doing in 2213?

22:13.947 --> 22:17.593
We are investigating an anachronism.

22:17.596 --> 22:19.296
An anachronism, really?

22:19.298 --> 22:22.032
- What is this place, anyway?
- Oh, come on, Ava.

22:22.034 --> 22:23.800
The jig's up. We know.

22:23.802 --> 22:26.102
What are you talking about?

22:34.279 --> 22:37.347
Oh, my God.

22:39.685 --> 22:43.011
Well, maybe she's not
a card-carrying member

22:43.014 --> 22:44.580
of the clone club after all.

22:45.724 --> 22:48.225
I must prepare for the Master's arrival.

22:50.562 --> 22:52.829
I trust you'll be able to make him talk?

22:52.831 --> 22:54.516
No problem, Nora doll.

22:54.519 --> 22:56.700
Talk? You don't have
to torture me to talk.

22:56.702 --> 22:59.836
The trick is you gotta
get me to shut up.

23:01.983 --> 23:03.583
It's not much of a trick.

23:08.241 --> 23:10.241
You will have the legends

23:10.244 --> 23:13.079
bring the missing totems to me.

23:13.082 --> 23:15.549
Or you will die.

23:18.957 --> 23:21.791
Your, um, daughter, she
looks... she looks...

23:21.793 --> 23:24.427
She looks different. No offense.

23:25.898 --> 23:27.030
None taken.

23:27.032 --> 23:29.745
Ah! Ahh!

23:29.748 --> 23:31.848
Ah, ha, ow.

23:31.851 --> 23:33.484
Her face...

23:33.487 --> 23:35.363
How long has that been a situation?

23:35.366 --> 23:36.437
You know what? Since you're gonna die,

23:36.439 --> 23:37.683
I might as well tell you.

23:37.686 --> 23:40.075
The-the closer that
Mallus gets to escaping

23:40.078 --> 23:42.047
his prison, the worse
the situation gets.

23:42.050 --> 23:43.817
Don't... stop looking...
Don't look at me.

23:43.820 --> 23:45.123
I'm just gonna... I'm just gonna...

23:48.253 --> 23:50.891
I'm sorry, it... it's
not you. It... it's me.

23:50.894 --> 23:53.350
Torture just doesn't bring
me the same joy anymore.

23:53.353 --> 23:55.691
It's okay, you're distracted, I get it.

23:55.694 --> 23:57.961
You made a deal with the
devil, now he's come back

23:57.963 --> 23:59.451
to claim your little girl. Am I right?

23:59.453 --> 24:00.867
Yes! I mean, I-I-I...

24:00.870 --> 24:03.203
I wanted to burn the world
down and rebuild it in my image,

24:03.206 --> 24:05.006
not lose the person I was doing it for.

24:05.009 --> 24:06.709
Damien, this is deep stuff, man.

24:06.712 --> 24:08.305
Let's just keep digging.
Let's keep digging.

24:08.307 --> 24:10.273
- Just do me one favor.
- Yes, what?

24:10.275 --> 24:12.833
Can you lose the cattle prod?
I mean, I'm gonna die anyways.

24:12.836 --> 24:14.711
Let's just make this a safe space.

24:14.713 --> 24:17.833
Safe space.

24:19.618 --> 24:21.051
Director Sharpe?

24:21.053 --> 24:23.141
- Mm.
- Director Sharpe.

24:23.144 --> 24:24.577
Are you okay?

24:24.580 --> 24:27.057
Oh, Gary. God, get out of my face.

24:27.059 --> 24:29.392
- I'll take that as a yes.
- Ugh.

24:29.394 --> 24:32.774
What do you remember before
you, uh, hit your head?

24:32.777 --> 24:34.229
Uh...

24:34.232 --> 24:36.865
I came to 2213 to...

24:36.868 --> 24:38.168
To find the mother ship,

24:38.170 --> 24:40.770
and I, uh... I stepped
out of the portal,

24:40.772 --> 24:42.906
and then you were breathing in my face.

24:42.908 --> 24:44.541
Is there something I'm forgetting?

24:44.543 --> 24:46.276
Uh, well, uh...

24:46.278 --> 24:47.711
Uh, before your little mishap,

24:47.713 --> 24:49.446
you were commending us on our great work

24:49.448 --> 24:50.573
and you even mentioned
something about a promotion.

24:50.575 --> 24:52.102
This is terrible.

24:52.105 --> 24:53.972
Okay, can we just tell her the truth?

24:53.975 --> 24:56.653
That, what, she was
hatched in a government lab?

24:56.655 --> 24:58.621
God, this whole time
I thought that she was

24:58.623 --> 25:01.778
hiding who she was, but
clearly she had no idea

25:01.781 --> 25:02.703
she was a clone.

25:02.706 --> 25:04.394
I mean, did you see the way she reacted?

25:07.499 --> 25:09.132
What was that?

25:09.134 --> 25:11.001
- Uh...
- No, d-don't.

25:11.003 --> 25:12.202
- What is...
- Don't.

25:15.667 --> 25:16.930
Don't what?

25:16.933 --> 25:18.919
- Thank God, she's gone.
- Who's gone?

25:18.922 --> 25:20.076
We gotta get out of here

25:20.078 --> 25:21.845
before that fembot sounds the alarm.

25:21.847 --> 25:23.346
"Fembot"?

25:23.348 --> 25:24.727
Come on.

25:26.618 --> 25:28.771
Okay, now concentrate on the target.

25:29.888 --> 25:32.689
It's about focus and precision.

25:32.691 --> 25:35.458
Like I need help
lighting things on fire.

25:35.460 --> 25:37.660
Okay.

25:37.662 --> 25:38.795
One...

25:38.797 --> 25:41.097
Two...

25:41.099 --> 25:42.766
Rory, could you focus on something

25:42.768 --> 25:44.701
other than your stomach for a second?

25:44.703 --> 25:46.302
Whatever.

25:48.874 --> 25:50.240
Ha-ha! Yeah.

25:50.243 --> 25:52.820
I said just the target, you idiot.

25:54.112 --> 25:56.279
- I'm the idiot?
- Yeah.

25:56.281 --> 25:58.515
You're the one who doesn't
eat when you're hungry.

25:58.517 --> 26:01.900
Maybe if you did, you
wouldn't be such a bitch.

26:01.903 --> 26:03.711
What did you just say?

26:03.714 --> 26:05.220
You heard me.

26:17.469 --> 26:19.702
Whoa, what is going on?

26:19.704 --> 26:22.405
Zari's training Rory.

26:22.407 --> 26:23.606
Or killing him.

26:23.608 --> 26:24.959
But now that you're back on the ship,

26:24.961 --> 26:26.875
we need to get out of
Detroit and back to work.

26:26.878 --> 26:28.978
Uh, Nate is actually still
trying to convince Mari

26:28.980 --> 26:31.848
not to be a vigilante,
and she is stubborn.

26:31.850 --> 26:34.084
I wonder where she gets that from.

26:34.086 --> 26:36.021
Kuasa. What're you doing here?

26:37.656 --> 26:40.099
- I come with a peace offering.
- How did you get that?

26:40.102 --> 26:42.086
Wait, wh... Where is Nate?

26:42.089 --> 26:44.336
I gave him to the Darhks
in exchange for the totem.

26:44.339 --> 26:46.829
- That wasn't the plan.
- What plan?

26:46.832 --> 26:49.866
Nate thought it'd be
better not to tell you.

26:49.868 --> 26:51.601
Because you're in love
with him, Nana Baa.

26:51.603 --> 26:54.360
And that love is a threat
to both Mari and me.

26:54.363 --> 26:56.972
- So you betrayed him?
- He's not my grandfather.

26:56.975 --> 26:58.808
Every moment that you spend with him

26:58.810 --> 27:00.813
is a threat to our
entire family's future.

27:00.816 --> 27:03.250
How can you be so selfish?

27:03.260 --> 27:05.060
You're the selfish one.

27:05.063 --> 27:08.030
Our family's destruction looms in 1992.

27:08.033 --> 27:10.052
You promised you'd save us.

27:10.055 --> 27:12.021
And yet you continuously search for ways

27:12.023 --> 27:14.624
to abandon your family and Zambesi.

27:14.626 --> 27:17.594
I have done everything in my
power to try and redeem you.

27:17.596 --> 27:19.758
And in doing so, Mari got hurt.

27:19.761 --> 27:21.564
She understands that
being a totem bearer means

27:21.566 --> 27:24.534
protecting all people, not just our own.

27:24.536 --> 27:28.099
It's no wonder this totem
ended up with Mari and not you.

27:28.102 --> 27:29.738
You're beyond redemption.

27:38.216 --> 27:40.250
Mother ship is this way.

27:40.253 --> 27:42.752
Sara, listen, I really need
to confess something to you.

27:42.754 --> 27:44.321
- Can we do this later?
- No, I... listen.

27:44.323 --> 27:46.017
I wasn't really visiting
my parents in Fresno.

27:46.019 --> 27:47.085
I don't even know why I said that.

27:47.087 --> 27:48.220
I never visit my parents.

27:48.223 --> 27:49.256
They're like strangers to me.

27:49.258 --> 27:50.036
You don't say.

27:50.039 --> 27:50.961
But when we broke up,

27:50.964 --> 27:52.769
I actually called my ex in Vegas.

27:52.772 --> 27:55.297
I'm so ashamed, but it's
worse than that, all right?

27:55.300 --> 27:57.300
I created an UpSwipz profile.

27:57.302 --> 27:59.575
And I actually went really
overboard on the swiping.

27:59.578 --> 28:01.841
It... it really is more
intuitive to go up and down,

28:01.844 --> 28:03.039
but that's not even the point.

28:03.041 --> 28:05.028
The point is I realize
that it's not for me.

28:05.031 --> 28:06.309
Okay? And...

28:06.311 --> 28:08.406
Look, I know that we aren't
together anymore, Sara,

28:08.409 --> 28:10.813
but I really just felt like I
needed to be honest with you.

28:10.815 --> 28:12.448
Okay?

28:12.450 --> 28:14.477
Great, now you all hate me.

28:14.480 --> 28:16.547
Not that I can blame you. I just...

28:16.550 --> 28:18.321
Can you please stop
looking at me like that?

28:18.323 --> 28:19.322
I can't take it.

28:19.324 --> 28:20.490
Ava.

28:20.492 --> 28:22.458
Look, it's not you, it...

28:22.460 --> 28:24.027
It's them.

28:36.119 --> 28:37.799
What the hell are those things,

28:37.802 --> 28:39.368
and why do they all look like me?

28:39.370 --> 28:40.819
- Okay.
- Uh...

28:40.822 --> 28:42.332
Well, short version,

28:42.335 --> 28:44.139
you're a clone.

28:44.141 --> 28:47.276
I'm a... I'm a clone?

28:47.278 --> 28:48.577
From the future?

28:48.579 --> 28:50.846
What're you... I'm a future clone thing?

28:50.848 --> 28:53.215
- Ava, shh.
- It's okay, Director Sharpe.

28:53.217 --> 28:54.621
Gary will take care of everything.

28:54.624 --> 28:55.824
No.

28:55.827 --> 28:57.720
She deserves to know.

28:57.722 --> 29:00.689
I don't understand.
This can't be happening.

29:00.691 --> 29:02.191
You're saying I'm one of them?

29:02.193 --> 29:03.926
Hey, look, this might
be where you're from,

29:03.928 --> 29:05.928
but it is not who you are.

29:05.931 --> 29:07.631
Then who the hell am I?

29:07.634 --> 29:10.064
You are the same person
that you have always been.

29:10.067 --> 29:12.434
You are the woman who has
worked her way to the top

29:12.436 --> 29:14.737
to becoming the head of the Time Bureau.

29:14.739 --> 29:16.338
- You are extraordinary.
- No.

29:16.340 --> 29:18.073
My... my life,

29:18.075 --> 29:20.876
my memories, they're all manufactured.

29:20.878 --> 29:22.949
They're... they're not
real. I'm not even real.

29:22.952 --> 29:24.647
Ava, you are real.

29:24.649 --> 29:26.715
You are as real as I feel about you.

29:28.213 --> 29:29.852
How can you even say that when I'm...

29:29.854 --> 29:31.420
I'm just like one of those things?

29:31.422 --> 29:33.289
Because I know you.

29:33.291 --> 29:36.792
And I know that you are a badass.

29:36.794 --> 29:39.695
And you are different.

29:39.697 --> 29:41.397
And now that we both know that,

29:41.399 --> 29:43.699
I need you to act exactly
like one of those clones

29:43.701 --> 29:45.234
if we wanna get out of here.

29:46.971 --> 29:49.271
Go ahead, Darhk.

29:49.273 --> 29:50.739
Make my day.

29:50.741 --> 29:52.775
You asked for it, steel boy.

29:52.777 --> 29:54.686
Ah, ha, ha, huh.

29:54.689 --> 29:56.756
- Was that good?
- Really good, really good.

29:56.759 --> 29:58.314
Just a little bit bigger this time.

29:58.316 --> 29:59.848
- Okay.
- Okay, you ready?

29:59.850 --> 30:02.384
Oh, no! Why, God?

30:02.386 --> 30:04.019
There's blood everywhere.

30:04.021 --> 30:05.888
There's so much blood.

30:07.291 --> 30:09.692
You know better than to
play Mallus for a fool.

30:09.695 --> 30:11.693
No, no, no, no, no,
honey, I can explain.

30:11.696 --> 30:13.095
Ah!

30:19.203 --> 30:23.706
Such a waste of a good head of hair.

30:23.708 --> 30:25.240
Hmm.

30:30.748 --> 30:32.748
Hey, get your hands off that hard body.

30:32.750 --> 30:35.250
I'm sorry, that sounded
way better in my head.

30:54.038 --> 30:57.339
What the hell?

31:04.115 --> 31:08.342
Seems that you and Kuasa have
resolved your family squabble.

31:08.345 --> 31:10.953
So much drama over a silly trinket.

31:10.955 --> 31:12.421
Pathetic.

31:12.423 --> 31:14.957
I wouldn't expect you
to understand anything

31:14.959 --> 31:18.961
about honor or legacy.

31:29.507 --> 31:31.106
Amaya!

31:41.052 --> 31:42.751
I've apprehended the intruders.

31:42.753 --> 31:45.287
I'll escort them from the
premises and terminate them.

31:45.289 --> 31:47.256
Move.

32:06.477 --> 32:07.843
Don't move.

32:13.713 --> 32:15.717
This one's a fake. She's not one of us.

32:15.719 --> 32:18.353
Step forward.

32:20.858 --> 32:25.160
You are to be reprocessed immediately.

32:28.513 --> 32:30.198
That feel fake to you?

32:34.371 --> 32:36.505
Stay close, I don't wanna
lose you in this crowd.

32:58.796 --> 33:00.662
Is this as weird for
you as it is for me?

33:03.556 --> 33:05.334
I've had messier breakups.

33:15.146 --> 33:17.764
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry, I...

33:18.956 --> 33:21.415
This is the second worst
attack of the clones I've seen.

33:25.956 --> 33:29.191
Please, please, I don't wanna do this.

33:29.193 --> 33:30.959
Ah.

33:30.961 --> 33:33.028
Gary.

33:33.030 --> 33:34.096
Thank God.

33:34.098 --> 33:37.194
It's the real you.

33:37.197 --> 33:39.063
Let's get back to the
ship before more show up.

33:39.071 --> 33:40.301
Yeah.

33:43.607 --> 33:44.940
You were right, Sara.

33:44.942 --> 33:46.942
I'm never gonna be a mindless clone.

33:50.948 --> 33:52.714
I'm keeping the suit.

34:01.025 --> 34:04.426
Your totem is still
governed by my powers.

34:06.730 --> 34:08.397
No.

34:09.989 --> 34:11.456
No.

34:18.976 --> 34:20.375
What're you doing here?

34:21.779 --> 34:23.212
I'm not here for you.

34:27.927 --> 34:29.516
Now get your ass up.

34:31.989 --> 34:34.156
Nathaniel.

34:34.158 --> 34:35.924
Love you too.

34:42.132 --> 34:44.766
Hardly seems like a fair fight.

34:44.768 --> 34:46.938
Then I'd give up now.

34:46.942 --> 34:49.208
I was talking about all of you.

34:51.875 --> 34:54.876
If you cannot defeat me in this vessel,

34:54.878 --> 34:58.671
how will you stop me once
I've assumed my true form?

35:03.120 --> 35:04.519
She's too strong.

35:04.521 --> 35:05.588
We have to leave.

35:05.591 --> 35:09.593
I gave you life, Kuasa.

35:09.596 --> 35:12.297
Offered you real power.

35:12.300 --> 35:14.233
Family is true power.

35:16.200 --> 35:19.067
I know you're in there somewhere, Nora.

35:19.069 --> 35:21.870
You have your father,
I have my grandmother.

35:21.872 --> 35:24.339
We don't have to become our demons.

35:26.591 --> 35:28.443
I like my demons.

35:39.690 --> 35:40.922
Nana Baa.

35:40.924 --> 35:42.891
Kuasa.

35:42.893 --> 35:45.294
No.

35:49.167 --> 35:52.387
She should've known.

35:52.390 --> 35:55.771
There's no running from Mallus.

36:02.913 --> 36:04.462
Amaya, we gotta get out of here.

36:04.465 --> 36:07.253
- No.
- Amaya, we gotta go.

36:13.362 --> 36:18.164
I'll do what you want.
Just... just put me down.

36:21.436 --> 36:22.836
Thanks.

36:22.838 --> 36:25.005
No, it wasn't me, it was our totems.

36:25.007 --> 36:26.906
Something's wrong.

36:30.679 --> 36:32.445
It's Kuasa.

36:32.447 --> 36:34.280
She's dead.

36:34.282 --> 36:36.049
Yeah.

36:37.452 --> 36:39.886
I need a drink.

36:44.062 --> 36:46.992
Gary, you cannot tell anyone
about what you saw in 2213.

36:46.995 --> 36:48.762
If you do, I will straight up kill you.

36:48.764 --> 36:50.563
But I'm terrible at keeping secrets.

36:50.565 --> 36:52.719
And every time I close
my eyes, all I see is you.

36:52.722 --> 36:54.122
I'll never get it out of my head.

36:54.125 --> 36:55.158
I wouldn't worry about it, Gary.

36:55.160 --> 36:56.202
Gary, right this way.

36:56.204 --> 36:58.104
I got a flasher with your name on it.

37:08.784 --> 37:11.317
If I had known that was gonna happen...

37:11.319 --> 37:12.886
It's not your fault.

37:12.888 --> 37:15.155
Still, I shouldn't have
gone behind your back.

37:15.157 --> 37:17.991
And I shouldn't have tried to
outsmart the Darhks on my own.

37:17.993 --> 37:20.660
You wanted me to have my totem back.

37:20.662 --> 37:22.862
And now I do.

37:22.864 --> 37:24.431
Come on, Amaya, just say it.

37:26.835 --> 37:29.335
I got Kuasa killed.

37:29.337 --> 37:32.223
I got my granddaughter killed.

37:32.226 --> 37:34.025
You?

37:34.028 --> 37:35.461
How?

37:35.464 --> 37:38.211
By goading her to be
more like her sister.

37:40.182 --> 37:43.249
Kuasa wanted to prove that
she was worthy of this.

37:45.520 --> 37:48.188
She died proving that
I was wrong about her,

37:48.190 --> 37:51.057
by saving the life of a man
who threatened her existence.

37:51.059 --> 37:53.059
Exactly, and if I didn't get captured,

37:53.061 --> 37:56.062
- then Kuasa...
- Was doomed either way.

37:56.064 --> 37:57.630
I mean, that's how time works.

37:57.632 --> 38:00.967
Well, clearly, time
wants my family to suffer.

38:00.969 --> 38:02.736
Amaya, you have to believe

38:02.738 --> 38:04.368
you're in charge of your own destiny.

38:07.275 --> 38:08.899
You know, there are times that I wish

38:08.902 --> 38:11.144
I'd never set foot on this ship.

38:11.146 --> 38:14.080
If I'd never left 1942,

38:14.082 --> 38:17.384
I would've returned to
Zambesi like I was supposed to,

38:17.387 --> 38:22.388
with no idea of the
tragedy that awaited me.

38:22.390 --> 38:24.224
I would've died an old woman.

38:24.226 --> 38:26.226
Murdered by warlords.

38:26.228 --> 38:28.348
And you and I never would've met.

38:28.351 --> 38:29.462
And...

38:32.768 --> 38:35.001
Is that what you want, Amaya?

38:37.873 --> 38:40.607
I don't know, Nathaniel.

38:50.786 --> 38:52.619
Mmm.

38:56.072 --> 38:57.470
Thought you couldn't eat.

38:57.473 --> 38:59.259
Yeah, I told Gideon to tell me

38:59.261 --> 39:01.494
when sundown would've
been if I'd been at home.

39:01.496 --> 39:03.396
But I mean, Ramadan is just a stupid

39:03.398 --> 39:05.431
1,400-year-old tradition to you, right?

39:05.433 --> 39:07.567
So why am I even talking about it?

39:07.569 --> 39:10.570
Well, uh, how about if I help you

39:10.572 --> 39:12.772
heat it up?

39:17.145 --> 39:19.441
Try it, it's good for you.

39:25.086 --> 39:27.687
You know, I can't stop
thinking about Kuasa.

39:27.689 --> 39:29.489
I felt her die.

39:29.491 --> 39:31.391
Uh, me too.

39:31.393 --> 39:34.327
Mind you, she did try to
kill us a couple of times.

39:34.329 --> 39:37.163
But she was a totem bearer,
and Amaya's granddaughter.

39:37.165 --> 39:40.700
And the totems supposedly
connect us to something larger.

39:40.702 --> 39:44.204
Yeah, for better or worse.

39:44.206 --> 39:46.072
You know, I think that's

39:46.074 --> 39:48.058
kind of why I still fast.

39:48.061 --> 39:50.176
When I was little, my mom
tried to get me to do it.

39:50.178 --> 39:51.811
And I wouldn't, but
she did make me learn

39:51.813 --> 39:53.079
how to cook iftar.

39:53.081 --> 39:56.716
It's the meal we eat to break the fast.

39:56.718 --> 39:58.641
And while she cooked, she would say

39:58.644 --> 40:01.187
that Ramadan's not just
a time for honoring God,

40:01.189 --> 40:04.557
but a time to honor
tradition and family.

40:04.559 --> 40:06.926
Community.

40:06.928 --> 40:11.297
So whenever I fast or cook iftar it...

40:11.299 --> 40:14.534
It makes me feel connected to my mom.

40:14.536 --> 40:15.969
I'm hungry.

40:18.707 --> 40:19.839
Still pork.

40:19.841 --> 40:21.808
Still good.

40:25.748 --> 40:27.681
You all right?

40:30.485 --> 40:33.303
You know, maybe you
should wipe my memory too.

40:33.306 --> 40:35.288
How am I supposed to
face the Time Bureau now,

40:35.290 --> 40:36.656
knowing what I know about myself?

40:36.658 --> 40:38.591
The same way that I face my team.

40:39.961 --> 40:42.228
We don't have the luxury
of running away and hiding.

40:42.230 --> 40:44.197
Not with the fight we have ahead of us.

40:44.199 --> 40:46.699
Our team's gonna need us
to lead them through this.

40:46.701 --> 40:48.601
You know, there just...
There must be some reason

40:48.603 --> 40:51.070
that I don't remember
anything about 2213.

40:51.072 --> 40:53.473
Anything about being a clone.

40:53.475 --> 40:55.375
I'm sure there is.

40:56.912 --> 40:59.078
Who recruited you for the Bureau?

41:00.348 --> 41:02.181
Rip.

41:02.183 --> 41:05.285
Well, I bet you that entire bottle

41:05.287 --> 41:07.420
he's the one who wiped
your file from the Bureau

41:07.422 --> 41:10.490
and put 2213 off limits.

41:10.492 --> 41:12.992
- Why would he do that to me?
- I don't know.

41:14.562 --> 41:17.797
But we're gonna find out.

41:20.268 --> 41:23.603
Gideon, initialize the
time drive and set a course.

41:23.605 --> 41:26.073
Traveling to this time
period is inadvisable.

41:26.076 --> 41:28.143
I'm sure Captain Lance
would not allow it.

41:28.146 --> 41:29.409
Please, Gideon.

41:29.411 --> 41:31.744
I have to save my granddaughter.

41:31.746 --> 41:34.013
I have to save my family.

41:34.015 --> 41:36.003
And no one is going to stop me.

41:36.006 --> 41:37.784
Now, lock in the coordinates.

41:37.786 --> 41:41.921
Course set for the M'Changa
province of Zambesi, 1992.
