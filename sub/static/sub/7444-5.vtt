00:16.621 --> 00:18.054
It's a jungle out there.

00:36.541 --> 00:38.179
It's a jungle out there.

01:11.021 --> 01:12.786
Get us a top up, would ya?

01:12.821 --> 01:14.781
Why don't you get it,
you lazy fucker?

01:14.816 --> 01:16.421
You can work off some of the flab.

01:16.456 --> 01:17.979
I like watching you do it.

01:35.261 --> 01:37.172
Thanks, babe.

01:40.581 --> 01:43.146
What?
Mark Moran's a sitting duck.

01:43.181 --> 01:44.786
Isn't this
what you've been waiting for?

01:44.821 --> 01:47.661
A chance to pay him back for
what him and Jason done to you.

01:47.696 --> 01:49.954
Are you talking about knocking him?

01:49.989 --> 01:52.213
Knocking him? Fuck me dead, toad.

01:53.581 --> 01:56.015
No, I'm talking about wrecking
his business, sending him broke.

01:57.381 --> 01:59.106
Yeah. Yeah, right.

01:59.141 --> 02:02.975
You know, treating him like dogshit,
just like he treated you.

02:04.101 --> 02:06.261
You had me going there for a second.

02:06.296 --> 02:08.420
No-one treats you like dogshit, babe.

02:08.455 --> 02:11.261
Do they?

02:16.381 --> 02:19.386
What?

02:19.421 --> 02:22.021
Nah, I was just pulling ya chain.
Pulling something.

02:22.056 --> 02:25.226
You know what? I like it.
You do?

02:25.261 --> 02:28.981
Yeah. Best idea I've heard all day.
What do you reckon?

02:29.016 --> 02:30.501
Someone should've knocked
Mark Moran years ago.

02:30.536 --> 02:31.946
Thinks he's criminal
fucking royalty.

02:31.981 --> 02:34.181
Well, I've got 50 grand
for the guy that volunteers.

02:34.216 --> 02:35.626
Hubba! Hubba!
You interested?

02:35.661 --> 02:37.706
Nah, not me.
I don't like loud noises.

02:37.741 --> 02:41.141
You like to hear a girl scream.
The one exception to my rule.

02:41.176 --> 02:43.906
Why don't YOU do it?

02:43.941 --> 02:45.666
You're the guy that wants it done.

02:45.701 --> 02:47.621
Nah, it's not my area.
I'm a businessman.

02:47.656 --> 02:49.186
You're supposed to be Action Man.

02:49.221 --> 02:52.621
If you ain't got the balls
to pull a trigger, fat boy,

02:52.656 --> 02:55.260
don't insult the guys that do.

03:11.261 --> 03:12.933
I've been a bad girl.

03:15.981 --> 03:18.266
I broke...

03:18.301 --> 03:21.020
I broke Mummy's best cup and saucer.

03:22.941 --> 03:24.579
That's very bad.

03:26.461 --> 03:28.372
You need to be punished for that.

04:09.941 --> 04:12.136
Ooh! Shit, Mark!

04:13.661 --> 04:15.094
That hurt.

04:21.380 --> 04:23.576
You're just lucky I like you.

04:44.301 --> 04:45.780
I love it when you're here.

04:49.021 --> 04:51.251
Don't use that word.
What word?

04:53.901 --> 04:55.698
Mark, you know
I didn't mean it like that.

04:57.021 --> 04:58.466
You start using it,

04:58.501 --> 05:02.261
and next thing it's "When
are you gonna leave your wife?"

05:02.296 --> 05:05.758
You know I'm not gonna
ask you that question, OK?

05:05.793 --> 05:09.221
Better that we're clear, you know,
about everything,

05:09.256 --> 05:12.452
so no-one gets hurt.

05:15.301 --> 05:16.734
Sure.

05:18.501 --> 05:20.586
Whatever.

05:20.621 --> 05:23.661
You're the big gangster.
Danielle.

05:23.696 --> 05:25.094
What?

05:26.181 --> 05:28.900
Come on.
No, don't.

05:30.621 --> 05:33.226
Give me a smile.

05:33.261 --> 05:36.936
You're adorable, you know that. Hmm?

05:38.301 --> 05:39.973
So, any bills due?

05:44.261 --> 05:45.694
You better go.

06:27.141 --> 06:29.746
Arggh!

06:29.781 --> 06:31.721
What the fuck is this?

06:31.756 --> 06:33.626
What are ya doing?

06:33.661 --> 06:36.892
You're vulnerable, mate. I could
have shot you a dozen times.

06:37.941 --> 06:40.100
You got no-one watching your back.

06:40.135 --> 06:42.260
All I'm saying is, I'm available.

06:44.021 --> 06:45.866
Even if I did need someone,

06:45.901 --> 06:48.581
why am I gonna pick a glue-sniffing
crackhead like you?

06:48.616 --> 06:51.306
Hey, that's bullshit.

06:51.341 --> 06:54.181
I never, ever sniffed
that Tarzan's Grip.

06:54.216 --> 06:56.092
When was the last time you ate?

07:01.701 --> 07:03.293
I always wanted a labrador.

07:04.341 --> 07:06.306
So, what are you
gonna do with yourself?

07:06.341 --> 07:10.141
Have another ale, if I may.
With your life, dickhead.

07:10.176 --> 07:13.021
How long you been out?
What, six months?

07:13.056 --> 07:14.706
You're just drifting, mate.

07:14.741 --> 07:17.981
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.
I've got a 5-step plan, mate.

07:18.016 --> 07:19.546
Oh, yeah? What's that?

07:19.581 --> 07:22.141
Nah, you'd just pinch it, eh?

07:22.176 --> 07:23.866
All you need to know is

07:23.901 --> 07:25.941
I'm gonna carve out
me own slice of the action,

07:25.976 --> 07:28.398
set up me own distribution network.

07:28.433 --> 07:30.786
Step one -
set up bona fide contacts.

07:30.821 --> 07:35.141
Now, how do I do that? By joining
your crew as a security adviser.

07:35.176 --> 07:36.746
Mate, I don't need a bodyguard.

07:36.781 --> 07:40.820
But come see me in a month or two,
I might be looking for people.

07:54.501 --> 07:56.201
No, there's something wrong
with this gun.

07:56.236 --> 07:57.901
Yeah, the fuckwit
pulling the trigger.

08:01.221 --> 08:03.901
Well, give me some more ammo,
smart-arse.

08:03.936 --> 08:06.581
How many times
have I gotta tell you, mate?

08:06.616 --> 08:09.278
Too tense, relax and squeeze.

08:09.313 --> 08:11.507
Yeah, I'll be closer on the day.

08:11.542 --> 08:13.666
What if he makes a run for it?

08:13.701 --> 08:16.941
Well, I thought the idea
was to hit him with a shottie first,

08:16.976 --> 08:19.381
immobilise him,
then finish him off with this.

08:19.416 --> 08:21.346
What if the shottie malfunctions?

08:21.381 --> 08:24.341
Hey, the point is, you've got to be
comfortable with both weapons, yeah?

08:24.376 --> 08:27.098
They've got to be like
an extension of your own body.

08:27.133 --> 08:29.821
You know - bang! Bang!
Give us a go of the shottie, then.

08:29.856 --> 08:32.335
Not until you get the pistol right.
Go again.

08:45.341 --> 08:47.855
He got his thumb! You idiot!

08:52.741 --> 08:56.661
How you doing, brother?
Good.

08:56.696 --> 08:58.617
Good.

08:59.941 --> 09:02.426
What's on your mind?
Mokbel.

09:02.461 --> 09:05.541
You having sexual fantasies
about a hairy Lebanese gangster?

09:05.576 --> 09:08.181
He's squeezing every other dealer
out of business.

09:08.216 --> 09:09.906
We could be next.

09:09.941 --> 09:11.586
What are the jacks doing about it?

09:11.621 --> 09:14.772
Fuck all. If we want things fixed,
we do it ourselves.

09:17.781 --> 09:19.373
Can it wait till I get out?

09:23.741 --> 09:27.221
I don't know, Mark. Stopping guys,
that's not your thing.

09:27.256 --> 09:29.386
I can handle it.
That's what I do, hmm?

09:29.421 --> 09:31.681
You load the gun,
I'm the one that pulls the trigger.

09:31.716 --> 09:33.941
Yeah, but you went fucking lulu
and ended up in here.

09:33.976 --> 09:37.297
Mark... I'm asking you to wait.

09:44.981 --> 09:46.733
What did you do to yourself, toad?

09:47.821 --> 09:50.426
Shh! I'm concentrating.

09:50.461 --> 09:53.339
Was someone leaning on you?
Someone trying to break your thumb?

09:56.061 --> 09:58.291
Tell me, toad. I'll bite
their fucking balls off.

10:00.581 --> 10:02.746
Slammed in a car door, alright?

10:02.781 --> 10:06.012
Come home. Come and make me
some tea, Mrs Williams.

10:11.621 --> 10:14.454
Whoo!

10:29.301 --> 10:31.506
Plenty of room for all of us,
even Tony Mokbel.

10:31.541 --> 10:35.181
If we don't stop him now,
he will force us out of business.

10:35.216 --> 10:37.386
We're all making a quid.
Tony knows not to crowd us.

10:37.421 --> 10:39.786
You don't get this party drug thing.
I get it. Don't worry.

10:39.821 --> 10:43.621
No, it's not about coke and speed
and choof, and all that shit anymore.

10:43.656 --> 10:45.861
Lewis, this is big,
and it's only gonna get bigger,

10:45.896 --> 10:47.426
'cause every kid out there

10:47.461 --> 10:49.941
thinks that swallowing an eccy's
like popping a vitamin.

10:49.976 --> 10:52.026
There's a billion dollars to be made.

10:52.061 --> 10:54.441
Yeah, yeah, I read
the Sunday papers too, mate.

10:54.476 --> 10:57.328
Well, you think Tony Mokbel
wants to share it?

10:57.363 --> 11:00.181
Give me one good reason
why we don't off him.

11:00.216 --> 11:02.626
"Off him"? Are you mad?

11:02.661 --> 11:04.541
Have you got your own deal
going with him?

11:04.576 --> 11:05.746
Talk sense.

11:05.781 --> 11:07.626
We lost the gambling,
we lost the parlours.

11:07.661 --> 11:11.581
And now we're gonna lose our slice
of the biggest fucking pie of all time.

11:11.616 --> 11:13.386
All you're gonna do is start a war.

11:13.421 --> 11:15.221
I'm trying to do something
for the family.

11:15.256 --> 11:16.746
What, destroy it?

11:16.781 --> 11:18.226
If it was Jason, you'd listen.

11:18.261 --> 11:20.321
Oh, here we go again -
poor bloody orphan Mark,

11:20.356 --> 11:22.346
always getting the rough end
of the pineapple.

11:22.381 --> 11:25.141
Oh, piss off, will you?
You're a bunch of fucking dinosaurs.

11:25.176 --> 11:26.938
Don't try and be something
you're not, Mark.

11:29.541 --> 11:30.496
Mark, don't...

11:41.101 --> 11:42.066
Come on, Norman.

11:42.101 --> 11:46.333
Come on, or I'll huff and I'll puff
and I'll blow your house down.

11:52.341 --> 11:55.861
It's three o'clock in the morning.
Yeah.

11:55.896 --> 11:59.101
Come on, mate. Come on.

11:59.136 --> 12:00.375
Mate!

12:05.301 --> 12:08.221
That's an even five grand
you owe me now.

12:08.256 --> 12:09.654
Nah.

12:12.021 --> 12:13.861
Hey, we're trying to make a profit
here, mate.

12:13.896 --> 12:17.098
Come on, Rich,
it's not a drop-in centre.

12:17.133 --> 12:20.235
You'll get it, mate.
I got a new gig, eh?

12:20.270 --> 12:23.338
I'm chief of security
for Mark Moran, eh?

12:25.621 --> 12:26.826
Nah, it's true.

12:26.861 --> 12:30.066
I got big plans, mate.

12:30.101 --> 12:32.341
I'm gonna take this town
by the scruff of the neck

12:32.376 --> 12:34.855
and shake the shit out of it.

12:36.501 --> 12:37.934
Hey!

12:56.461 --> 12:57.906
The working girls who use the motel

12:57.941 --> 12:59.661
reckon they saw a guy come out
afterwards

12:59.696 --> 13:01.178
but he was wearing a balaclava.

13:01.213 --> 13:02.626
Well, it was a professional hit -

13:02.661 --> 13:04.586
shotgun to stop him,
pistol to finish him off.

13:04.621 --> 13:07.661
Why? I mean, who'd want to do this
to a harmless goon like Mad Rich?

13:07.696 --> 13:09.379
Do you really care?

13:11.381 --> 13:13.861
According to his dealer,
he was working as your bodyguard.

13:13.896 --> 13:15.546
You are joking?

13:15.581 --> 13:17.026
Well, that's what he said.

13:17.061 --> 13:18.821
You two have any kind
of business arrangement?

13:18.856 --> 13:20.266
I haven't seen him in years.

13:20.301 --> 13:22.701
You've had no contact with him
in the last seven months

13:22.736 --> 13:24.698
since he got out of jail?

13:24.733 --> 13:26.626
None at all.
Come on, Mark.

13:26.661 --> 13:28.861
We both know that's a load of crap,
don't we?

13:28.896 --> 13:30.586
Would not even recognise the guy.

13:30.621 --> 13:33.781
Let's assume whoever's responsible
believed the rumours.

13:33.816 --> 13:36.221
You got any enemies
we need to know about?

13:36.256 --> 13:38.146
I'm a normal, suburban guy.

13:38.181 --> 13:40.181
I don't care what sort of bloke
Mladenich was.

13:40.216 --> 13:41.666
No-one deserves to die like that.

13:41.701 --> 13:43.621
So if you've got any information,
let's have it.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.826
Sorry, I can't help ya.

13:45.861 --> 13:48.866
Richard Mladenich?
I never heard of him.

13:48.901 --> 13:51.581
He's the bloke you abducted
in the boot, remember?

13:51.616 --> 13:53.578
The abduction you're out on bail for.

13:53.613 --> 13:55.557
Oh, yeah. That Richard Mladenich.

13:55.592 --> 13:57.466
Oh, right, yeah. Now I remember.

13:57.501 --> 13:59.696
You and me in the kitchen, Rocco.
Let's go.

14:03.221 --> 14:05.106
So, here's the facts, Dino -

14:05.141 --> 14:08.541
you're up for abduction,
deprivation of liberty charges,

14:08.576 --> 14:10.621
and the victim was found last night
shot dead.

14:10.656 --> 14:12.661
So where were you?
What time?

14:12.696 --> 14:14.586
Between dusk and dawn.

14:14.621 --> 14:18.701
I was with Rocco, at his joint
from dinnertime, watching telly.

14:18.736 --> 14:22.901
So you didn't move for 12 hours?
Nah, we were stoned.

14:22.936 --> 14:26.261
You got a problem with that?
What did you watch?

14:26.296 --> 14:29.571
Just them ads - you know the ads.

14:30.661 --> 14:36.826
'Telecafe', 'Abdo Master',
'Mr Biceps'.

14:36.861 --> 14:40.341
Chuck Norris has a new range out.
He's doing, uh...

14:40.376 --> 14:41.946
Wait a sec, wait a sec, yeah, yeah.

14:41.981 --> 14:44.461
We went out to grab a shawarma roll
around two or three-ish.

14:44.496 --> 14:47.141
Where'd you go for a feed?
Puckle Street, Moonee Ponds.

14:47.176 --> 14:49.581
Except the shithole was closed.
That's convenient.

14:49.616 --> 14:51.026
Not for us, we were starving.

14:51.061 --> 14:54.221
Dino had to stop for cash.
He was well pissed off.

14:54.256 --> 14:56.815
Are we done?
My Hawaiian's getting cold.

15:01.181 --> 15:03.121
Mark, how are you?
Good.

15:03.156 --> 15:05.026
What can we do for you?

15:05.061 --> 15:08.461
Bloke I know's got a shipment
of coke coming in any day.

15:08.496 --> 15:11.226
How do you know? Did he tell ya?

15:11.261 --> 15:14.621
Got contacts on the wharves.
Nothing comes in without help.

15:14.656 --> 15:16.538
How many K's?
Three to five.

15:16.573 --> 15:18.421
Oh, piss-weak.
Why tell us?

15:18.456 --> 15:20.346
Being public spirited.

15:20.381 --> 15:23.301
And what do you expect in return?
Not a thing.

15:23.336 --> 15:27.426
Alright, give us a name.
Antonios Mokbel.

15:27.461 --> 15:30.021
And I happen to have his secret,
unlisted number.

15:33.941 --> 15:35.541
Thanks, Mark.
No worries.

15:35.576 --> 15:36.986
See youse later.

15:37.021 --> 15:38.932
See you, Mark.
See ya.

15:45.621 --> 15:48.821
I forgot to ask you, Mark -
how's business your end?

15:48.856 --> 15:50.586
I'm a pastry chef, mate.

15:50.621 --> 15:54.666
Yeah, well, would a pastry chef
have any use

15:54.701 --> 15:58.301
for a cheap and reliable source
of precursor chemicals?

15:58.336 --> 16:00.306
Sourced from where?

16:00.341 --> 16:02.506
Ever heard of
the Controlled Delivery System?

16:02.541 --> 16:05.061
We sell small quantities of pseudo
to street-level dealers

16:05.096 --> 16:07.336
then follow the trails
back to the drug labs.

16:08.541 --> 16:10.386
Are you gonna supply me
then arrest me?

16:10.421 --> 16:14.466
No. I'm proposing
a different arrangement, Mark.

16:14.501 --> 16:17.538
You get something for free,
I get to top up my super.

16:19.141 --> 16:20.861
How does your partner
feel about that?

16:20.896 --> 16:22.374
Who? Good cop?

16:24.061 --> 16:27.576
No, I don't like to burden him
with too much information.

16:36.861 --> 16:38.701
What the fuck you doing?!

16:38.736 --> 16:41.010
Oh, fuck me.

16:44.181 --> 16:45.746
What do you blokes want?

16:45.781 --> 16:48.586
Senior detectives Parker and Love,
drug squad.

16:48.621 --> 16:51.135
Would you mind popping the luggage
compartment, please, Tony?

17:57.941 --> 18:00.501
You know what everyone's saying?
Mark Moran.

18:00.536 --> 18:02.492
Who dogged on Tony?

18:03.621 --> 18:05.106
Fuck.
Yeah, mate.

18:05.141 --> 18:08.541
He's in tight with them drug squad D's -
Jeremy Parker, Vince Love.

18:08.576 --> 18:10.906
What do you reckon?
Not bad.

18:10.941 --> 18:14.421
Yeah, as long as the target's made
of polystyrene and doesn't move.

18:14.456 --> 18:15.854
It's fibreglass.

18:24.781 --> 18:26.866
Richard Mladenich.

18:26.901 --> 18:28.941
He's been trying to muscle in
on other blokes' rackets

18:28.976 --> 18:30.386
ever since he got out.

18:30.421 --> 18:33.626
Drugs, standover,
even personal protection,

18:33.661 --> 18:36.081
but everyone's been telling
the mad bastard to get stuffed.

18:36.116 --> 18:38.948
Since when do we refer to
murder victims as "mad bastards"?

18:38.983 --> 18:41.902
Well, everyone calls him 'Mad Ri... '
Not everyone. Not us.

18:41.937 --> 18:44.821
Dino Dibra's cash card was used
at a Bank of Melbourne ATM

18:44.856 --> 18:46.941
at Moonee Ponds
at 3:05 that morning.

18:46.976 --> 18:48.746
Doesn't mean it was him.

18:48.781 --> 18:50.741
Is there a security camera?
Yeah.

18:50.776 --> 18:52.541
Request the footage.
Sure.

18:52.576 --> 18:53.506
Excuse me, boss -

18:53.541 --> 18:56.381
do you know a fella by the name of
Frank Benvenuto?

18:56.416 --> 18:59.186
I am familiar with a third-rate
gangster of that name

18:59.221 --> 19:01.621
who thinks he runs the central fruit
and vegie market, yes.

19:01.656 --> 19:03.706
He was shot dead 20 minutes ago
in his driveway.

19:03.741 --> 19:05.821
The Assistant Commissioner
wants you upstairs for a powwow.

19:05.856 --> 19:08.813
Right. I want a full team
out there straightaway.

19:11.141 --> 19:13.221
You alright to run
this Mladenich file on your own?

19:13.256 --> 19:14.654
Sure.

19:20.981 --> 19:24.656
He was bad, a bad boy.

19:25.941 --> 19:29.581
He had to go away
to home for bad boys.

19:29.616 --> 19:31.856
They took my little Richie.

19:32.941 --> 19:35.481
They brought me back zombie.

19:35.516 --> 19:37.986
Look, I'm sorry, Mrs Mladenich.

19:38.021 --> 19:41.461
I didn't mean to upset you. I just
thought you may be able to help us.

19:41.496 --> 19:44.817
Promise me you'll catch the killer.

19:46.101 --> 19:48.641
Now, I can't promise you that.
You don't care.

19:48.676 --> 19:51.181
No, it's not
that I don't care. It's just...

19:51.216 --> 19:54.537
And... bring me photo.

19:56.461 --> 19:58.181
Sorry, bring you a photo of what?

19:58.216 --> 20:00.649
My Richard, dead.

20:01.941 --> 20:06.141
Sorry, you want me to bring you a...
crime scene photo?

20:06.176 --> 20:08.496
Mmm.

20:12.421 --> 20:14.701
They're a Bosnian version
of a cabbage roll.

20:14.736 --> 20:16.261
Very garlicky.
Mm-hm.

20:18.261 --> 20:22.741
You know what that is -
big vampire problem in Bosnia.

20:22.776 --> 20:23.866
Mmm.
Massive.

20:23.901 --> 20:26.261
Right, well, tell Mrs Magwich
when you see her

20:26.296 --> 20:28.695
that the cabbage rolls
were damn good.

20:31.621 --> 20:36.101
Mladen-ik.
Mladen-ik. Mladen-ich.

20:36.136 --> 20:37.693
Had an itch.

20:48.861 --> 20:50.658
He's not coming to bed with us.

20:56.021 --> 20:57.420
Thanks.

21:14.101 --> 21:16.106
Sure this is a good idea?

21:16.141 --> 21:18.436
You can stay in the car if you want.

21:18.471 --> 21:20.732
Dino, just a few more questions, mate.

21:21.781 --> 21:24.346
No, don't do that.
Get out of the car. Come on, mate.

21:24.381 --> 21:27.261
Are you right? I'm a busy man.
Let's have a chat. Come on out.

21:27.296 --> 21:28.706
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

21:28.741 --> 21:30.581
When was the last time
you saw Richard Mladenich?

21:30.616 --> 21:31.706
I can't remember.

21:31.741 --> 21:33.186
Here's what I reckon -

21:33.221 --> 21:36.261
he changed his mind about testifying,
you thought you'd shut him up.

21:36.296 --> 21:38.266
Are you arresting me? No.

21:38.301 --> 21:41.261
'Cause you got no proof, 'cause
I never touched a hair off his head.

21:41.296 --> 21:44.298
Are you familiar with
the contact trace theory, Dino?

21:44.333 --> 21:47.301
Every murderer takes
a trace of the scene away with him.

21:47.336 --> 21:48.859
Leaves a trace of himself
at the scene.

21:50.301 --> 21:53.611
Next time I see you, you better
be wearing a bulletproof vest.

21:58.141 --> 22:00.018
I'd describe him as "very dangerous".

22:01.381 --> 22:04.341
Well, I'd expect you to use
the necessary force,

22:04.376 --> 22:06.621
if you catch my meaning.

22:06.656 --> 22:08.418
OK, thanks.

22:14.061 --> 22:15.546
Well, so where do we do it?

22:15.581 --> 22:18.261
How do I get Mark close enough,
you know, in range?

22:18.296 --> 22:19.906
Where do we isolate him?

22:19.941 --> 22:22.801
Knock on his fucking door!
"Hello, Mark." Boom! That's a plan.

22:22.836 --> 22:26.008
He's gonna open up when he sees
a guy in a balaclava and overalls?

22:26.043 --> 22:29.181
How about we set fire to his house,
and when he runs outside, boom!

22:29.216 --> 22:30.786
That's even better.
That's a good idea.

22:30.821 --> 22:33.301
Reckon we should do that.
I'm taking the piss, you dickheads.

22:33.336 --> 22:35.371
So, just get the shottie out...

22:37.021 --> 22:38.454
Freeze! Police!

22:45.901 --> 22:50.421
Put your hands back.
That's it. Behind your back.

22:50.456 --> 22:52.066
Up on your feet, come on!

22:52.101 --> 22:57.381
Get in there. Get in! Get in!
You mongrel. You idiot!

22:57.416 --> 22:59.586
Get in that car!

22:59.621 --> 23:02.301
I hear you roughed up a suspect.
I never touched him.

23:02.336 --> 23:04.226
Don't insult my intelligence, son.

23:04.261 --> 23:06.986
You had a man beaten up
and you did it by proxy.

23:07.021 --> 23:09.821
I don't operate that way.
None of my crew operate that way.

23:09.856 --> 23:11.306
What makes you think you can?

23:11.341 --> 23:13.661
In my book, it's a matter for
the Ethical Standards Branch.

23:13.696 --> 23:15.466
I actually picked up the phone
to the ESB,

23:15.501 --> 23:17.941
and I still don't know
why I put it down again.

23:17.976 --> 23:20.026
This is your first
and only warning, son.

23:20.061 --> 23:23.576
You bend the rules again like this,
you'll be back chasing stolen VCRs.

23:26.301 --> 23:28.496
Won't happen again, boss.
Too right it won't.

23:30.661 --> 23:31.855
Sit down.

23:36.141 --> 23:39.372
I believe there was
an ATM security camera installed.

23:40.981 --> 23:43.621
Dibra was clocked at exactly 3:05am
making a withdrawal.

23:43.656 --> 23:45.066
He's not our man.

23:45.101 --> 23:48.301
Why did you go hell for leather
after him in the first place?

23:48.336 --> 23:49.781
Whatever happened
to keeping an open mind?

23:49.816 --> 23:51.506
I thought I was keeping an open mind.

23:51.541 --> 23:54.941
It's basic, I realise that.
That's why it's easy to forget.

23:54.976 --> 23:57.416
Ask yourself how many hours
you've wasted chasing him.

23:57.451 --> 23:59.857
What if you'd spent those hours
chasing other leads?

24:02.421 --> 24:03.866
Well, I don't have any other leads.

24:03.901 --> 24:05.892
Because you had
your Dino Dibra blinkers on.

24:07.901 --> 24:10.290
Why do you think I left you
to run with this file?

24:12.581 --> 24:17.581
Because I've got faith in your
instincts and your work ethic,

24:17.616 --> 24:19.546
but not your methodology.

24:19.581 --> 24:23.706
Alright. So, what do I do now?

24:23.741 --> 24:28.341
Tenacity. Thoroughness.
Professionalism.

24:28.376 --> 24:29.786
You go back to square one.

24:29.821 --> 24:31.906
Re-interview Mladenich's dealer.

24:31.941 --> 24:33.906
Talk to those girls
in that motel room.

24:33.941 --> 24:36.941
Check his phone records.
Talk to his mates. Talk to his enemies.

24:36.976 --> 24:38.386
Keep asking questions,

24:38.421 --> 24:40.981
and eventually you'll ask a question
that'll give you an answer.

24:46.981 --> 24:48.414
How are you?

24:51.621 --> 24:53.498
Fucking fantastic.

25:20.501 --> 25:23.459
Ahhh! Oh!

25:25.781 --> 25:27.294
Shit.

25:47.501 --> 25:48.466
What's this?

25:48.501 --> 25:50.935
To make up for being
such a prick last week.

25:54.901 --> 25:56.334
Oh, my God.

25:58.421 --> 26:01.797
They're gorgeous.
You like 'em?

26:01.832 --> 26:05.174
Yes. Yes. Thank you. Thank you.

26:07.621 --> 26:10.466
Am I forgiven?
Yes.

26:10.501 --> 26:12.696
I will never
use that bad word again.

26:14.741 --> 26:17.621
A bad girl needs to learn
to live by the rules.

26:17.656 --> 26:19.266
She does.
Yes, she does.

26:19.301 --> 26:21.301
Otherwise she might get a smack.

26:27.421 --> 26:29.421
Buy you anything you want soon.

26:29.456 --> 26:31.491
Really?
Yeah.

26:44.821 --> 26:47.546
It was beautiful. Got him cold.

26:47.581 --> 26:50.466
Three kilos of pure Mexican
in his boot.

26:50.501 --> 26:52.941
He's out on bail,
but he'll do two years for sure.

26:52.976 --> 26:54.958
I wish you could've seen it.

26:54.993 --> 26:56.906
Didn't I say to fucking wait?

26:56.941 --> 26:58.741
Are you listening to me?
Problem solved.

26:58.776 --> 27:00.946
Problem solved?

27:00.981 --> 27:04.146
What happens when he sends
his brother or cousins after ya?

27:04.181 --> 27:07.661
Who's gonna watch your back, Mark?
Everyone knows you dogged on him.

27:07.696 --> 27:09.866
You don't think I can deal
with a bunch of Lebs?

27:09.901 --> 27:12.546
I'll cut him in if I have to.
That's not the problem.

27:12.581 --> 27:16.061
The problem is getting you and Lewis
to see the big fucking picture.

27:16.096 --> 27:17.699
What the fuck is wrong with you?!

27:20.301 --> 27:22.212
Fuck!

27:51.821 --> 27:53.459
Well, we all know what we gotta do.

28:10.141 --> 28:11.620
Shit!

28:26.381 --> 28:28.301
One, two, three. Go.

28:28.336 --> 28:30.066
OK.

28:30.101 --> 28:32.092
Nice and easy so you don't come off.

28:33.261 --> 28:34.826
Skaifey's got the jump.

28:34.861 --> 28:37.786
Come on, Brocky, you can do it.
OK.

28:37.821 --> 28:39.379
Nice and easy.
Don't come off the track.

28:41.021 --> 28:43.661
Almost, almost. You're nearly there.

28:43.696 --> 28:46.301
Come on.
Skaifey's smashing ya.

28:46.336 --> 28:48.738
I know! But I'm stuck.

28:48.773 --> 28:51.141
Who wants mini drumsticks?

28:51.176 --> 28:52.666
Me, please.

28:52.701 --> 28:54.546
There you go.
Thank you.

28:54.581 --> 28:56.776
Your mobile's beeping at me.
Thank you, Mum.

29:06.981 --> 29:08.414
Don't go out again tonight.

29:29.541 --> 29:30.974
Hang on.

29:33.181 --> 29:35.306
Steve.

29:35.341 --> 29:39.261
You wanted to make a statement
about Richard Mladenich's death?

29:39.296 --> 29:40.694
Yeah.

29:46.501 --> 29:47.934
Well, shoot.

30:06.261 --> 30:08.013
Vince, it's me. Where are ya?

30:09.181 --> 30:11.421
Well, you know everybody's
saying he's working for Mark Moran?

30:11.456 --> 30:13.855
I actually heard
he's working for the Phuongs.

30:15.581 --> 30:17.361
The Phuongs?

30:17.396 --> 30:19.106
P-H-O-U-N-G.

30:19.141 --> 30:22.066
They run a car rebirthing scam
out of Thomastown.

30:22.101 --> 30:24.426
Anyway, I heard that Richard
was their number one driver,

30:24.461 --> 30:27.261
but I also heard he had this private
deal going on with Wally Shevchuk.

30:27.296 --> 30:29.186
You know Wally the Chook?

30:29.221 --> 30:31.177
The Ukrainian guy that runs
the amphets out of Lalor.

31:00.301 --> 31:01.906
Chickenshit!

31:01.941 --> 31:03.821
Alright, alright, alright, alright.

31:03.856 --> 31:05.413
What?

31:06.621 --> 31:08.461
What are you wasting my time for?

31:08.496 --> 31:10.386
What do you mean?

31:10.421 --> 31:13.421
You come down here telling me
these bullshit stories, Dino. Why?

31:13.456 --> 31:16.141
You wasted a shitload
of my time, mate.

31:16.176 --> 31:17.574
Now you know what it feels like.

31:21.341 --> 31:23.616
Anybody call for me?
No. Why?

31:25.381 --> 31:27.621
Some prick's winding me up.
I'm gonna put the bins out.

31:27.656 --> 31:29.981
Hey... leave it till the morning.

31:30.016 --> 31:32.226
Come and have a spa with me.

31:32.261 --> 31:34.331
The kids are in bed. We can play.

31:48.101 --> 31:49.534
Wanna run the spa?

31:51.701 --> 31:53.419
Back in a sec.

32:21.981 --> 32:23.175
Oi!

32:38.661 --> 32:41.255
Piece of piss, mate!

32:54.461 --> 32:57.581
Hey, mate, you got any Lambrusco?
Lambrusco?

32:57.616 --> 32:59.492
Yeah, Lambrusco.
Sure.

33:02.621 --> 33:04.054
Come on.

33:05.141 --> 33:06.574
Go, go, go, go, go!

33:28.981 --> 33:32.141
TV's not saying it's him, but it's
outside his house, so it's gotta be.

33:32.176 --> 33:34.106
It's gotta be. Fuck!

33:34.141 --> 33:35.574
Did you hear what I said?

34:03.341 --> 34:05.066
Mark Moran was murdered tonight.

34:05.101 --> 34:08.092
Yeah. No, we saw that on TV.
Figured it must have been him.

34:09.141 --> 34:11.940
So, where's your partner gone?
Carl home?

34:11.976 --> 34:13.498
Yeah.
Can I come in?

34:17.781 --> 34:19.226
Carl?

34:19.261 --> 34:20.694
Looking relaxed.

34:24.981 --> 34:27.266
We were just saying,
you know, what a tragedy.

34:27.301 --> 34:30.134
You know, lovely young bloke
like Mark cut down in his prime.

34:31.860 --> 34:33.386
Where were you tonight, Carl?

34:33.420 --> 34:35.146
Say, from about
seven o'clock onwards.

34:35.181 --> 34:38.541
I was having a bite to eat
at the Hotel Terminus, Camberwell.

34:38.576 --> 34:41.009
On your own?
With a mate.

34:42.781 --> 34:44.706
Left about 8:45.

34:44.741 --> 34:46.341
Grabbed a bottle of plonk
for my missus.

34:46.376 --> 34:48.331
Cabbed it home by about half-past.

34:49.661 --> 34:51.380
This mate of yours can confirm it?

34:51.416 --> 34:53.065
Know anything about Mark's death?

34:53.101 --> 34:55.581
Nope.
You have anything to do with it?

34:55.616 --> 34:57.595
Nope.
Did you pay to have him killed?

34:57.630 --> 34:59.574
That's enough. Get out of my house.

35:06.061 --> 35:08.780
You want me to have
one of them gunpowder tests?

35:11.701 --> 35:13.214
You mean a gunshot residue test?

35:14.901 --> 35:16.971
Just had a shower, have you, Carl?

36:09.461 --> 36:11.426
At approximately
eight o'clock last night

36:11.461 --> 36:15.221
underworld figure Mark Moran
was gunned down outside his house.

36:15.256 --> 36:17.266
A member of
the infamous Moran family,

36:17.301 --> 36:20.541
Moran was murdered in a manner
police say bears all the hallmarks

36:20.576 --> 36:22.586
of an underworld execution.

36:22.621 --> 36:24.826
As yet there are no witnesses
to the shooting,

36:24.861 --> 36:27.781
but police are appealing to the public
who might have information

36:27.816 --> 36:29.301
to contact Crime Stoppers.

37:24.541 --> 37:26.337
You be strong for me, love.

37:26.372 --> 37:28.133
Moran women gotta be strong.

37:55.541 --> 37:56.974
Jason!

38:00.501 --> 38:02.856
Look at what they did.
Come on.

38:04.101 --> 38:05.534
Put him down.

38:47.981 --> 38:52.221
Mark... thank you for everything
you did for me

38:52.256 --> 38:53.654
and for our family.

38:54.861 --> 38:57.421
Your beautiful smile and face
I will never forget.

38:59.421 --> 39:01.799
You were, and you always will be,

39:01.834 --> 39:04.178
the most important person in my life.

39:06.981 --> 39:08.461
Mark, you have deeply touched
everyone

39:08.496 --> 39:09.894
who came into contact with you.

39:11.621 --> 39:14.861
And we have all lost
an integral link in our family.

39:14.896 --> 39:16.294
Goodbye for now.

39:22.421 --> 39:23.854
And I will see you again.

39:25.461 --> 39:27.531
I love you, brother.

39:32.621 --> 39:34.054
This is just the beginning.

39:36.021 --> 39:37.579
I will never forget.

40:11.061 --> 40:14.417
We don't have any serious suspects, Mrs
Mladenich.

40:16.141 --> 40:18.211
We don't even have any leads.
I'm sorry.

40:20.501 --> 40:24.141
It may be related to the murder
of a man called Mark Moran,

40:24.176 --> 40:25.658
though we're not sure.

40:25.693 --> 40:27.277
He sent me flowers.

40:27.312 --> 40:28.826
Who? Mark Moran did?

40:28.861 --> 40:31.250
Yeah. I threw them in the bin.

40:32.421 --> 40:34.786
He...

40:34.821 --> 40:36.306
...criminal.

40:36.341 --> 40:39.378
Yes.
Nothing will help.

40:40.661 --> 40:42.094
My Richard is dead.

40:45.941 --> 40:47.699
The file stays open.

40:47.734 --> 40:49.457
You bring photo?
