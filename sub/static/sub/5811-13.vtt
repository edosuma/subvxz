00:02.200 --> 00:03.122
Previously on Arrow...

00:03.280 --> 00:05.442
<i>- Who's the blackmailer?
- He calls himself The Calculator.</i>

00:05.640 --> 00:08.610
<i>Well, Calculator now has
everything he needs to melt the Internet.</i>

00:08.920 --> 00:10.081
Oh, my God.

00:10.400 --> 00:11.447
Dad?

00:12.080 --> 00:13.889
Taiana. I need to tell you something.

00:14.080 --> 00:15.286
I killed your brother.

00:15.960 --> 00:17.166
No.

00:18.280 --> 00:19.964
Thea.

00:20.320 --> 00:21.446
What's happening?

00:22.280 --> 00:23.441
It's the wound. From Ra's.

00:23.600 --> 00:25.967
<i>If the life she owes
doesn't come from taking others,</i>

00:26.120 --> 00:28.282
<i>it will come from the life of the host.</i>

00:28.680 --> 00:29.681
Thea, please, don't go.

00:34.840 --> 00:36.683
There's only one way to prevent that.

00:36.960 --> 00:39.440
My father once told me of an elixir
known as the Lotus.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.809
And I will freely give it to you
on one condition.

00:42.120 --> 00:44.282
I want you to kill Malcolm Merlyn.

00:44.640 --> 00:46.768
If you cared about Thea,

00:47.120 --> 00:49.851
then curing her bloodlust
wouldn't come with any conditions.

00:50.080 --> 00:51.491
Thea is my sister-in-law.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.446
- You are my husband.
- I'm not your husband.

00:54.840 --> 00:58.322
But war does not know family bonds
nor friendly sentiments.

00:58.520 --> 00:59.646
Who are you at war with?

00:59.840 --> 01:03.322
I just told you I want you to kill
Malcolm Merlyn. Try to guess.

01:04.040 --> 01:05.200
Hey-

01:05.800 --> 01:08.770
If you have a problem with Malcolm Merlyn,

01:09.000 --> 01:10.001
deal with it yourself.

01:10.200 --> 01:12.328
Do not involve me or my sister.

01:12.520 --> 01:15.126
You put the Demon's Head ring
on Malcolm's hand.

01:18.480 --> 01:19.970
You can't defeat him.

01:20.160 --> 01:21.685
But you can.

01:22.120 --> 01:23.121
You have.

01:23.320 --> 01:26.005
That was before I knew
that he was my sister's father.

01:26.200 --> 01:27.884
So he dies so his child might live.

01:28.120 --> 01:29.884
Didn't your father make a similar bargain?

01:30.560 --> 01:31.800
I'm sorry, Oliver.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.048
I would not resort to this
if I had any other choice.

01:34.320 --> 01:36.209
Listen, my sister is dying.

01:37.840 --> 01:40.047
Because of something that your father did.

01:40.880 --> 01:42.325
I think you have every choice.

01:42.520 --> 01:45.091
Thea is dying
because of what her father did.

01:46.520 --> 01:49.569
I am only following events
to their inevitable conclusion.

02:08.080 --> 02:09.570
You know what's strange?

02:09.919 --> 02:12.048
Watching your baby girl drink coffee.

02:12.200 --> 02:13.531
Yeah, it would probably be
a little less strange

02:13.720 --> 02:15.882
if you'd seen your baby girl
in the last eighteen years.

02:16.240 --> 02:17.287
You're right.

02:18.520 --> 02:21.888
Don't suppose it helps if I say that
I thought staying out of your life

02:22.040 --> 02:23.405
was the best thing for you.

02:23.560 --> 02:26.689
- I was protecting you and your mother.
- You were protecting yourself.

02:27.360 --> 02:29.442
You were wanted by the police
and you didn't want to go to jail.

02:29.680 --> 02:31.284
That is why you stayed away.

02:31.520 --> 02:33.124
And you know why the police were after me?

02:33.360 --> 02:36.364
- The type of "criminal" I was?
- Mom never went into detail.

02:37.240 --> 02:39.891
I assume petty stuff.
Anything else requires commitment.

02:40.080 --> 02:41.570
Well, I'm here now.

02:42.440 --> 02:45.444
And I want us to speak openly.
I'll answer any questions you have.

02:45.760 --> 02:47.922
Okay, I just have one at the moment.

02:48.600 --> 02:51.604
- Why now?
- I was doing a job for someone.

02:52.560 --> 02:53.925
Almost got beat.

02:54.600 --> 02:56.125
Almost. My adversary,

02:57.280 --> 02:58.441
had exceptional skills.

02:58.640 --> 03:01.883
My curiosity piqued.
I investigated further.

03:02.280 --> 03:04.282
Imagine what I discovered.

03:05.480 --> 03:06.766
Overwatch.

03:11.320 --> 03:13.288
Bye. See you never.

03:13.480 --> 03:16.245
Felicity, wait. It is not what you think.

03:16.480 --> 03:19.086
My employer, my work,
is hardly diabolical.

03:19.280 --> 03:20.964
I'll be sure to tell that to my friend
who you blackmailed.

03:21.120 --> 03:23.964
Short-term legal mischief
for long term societal gain.

03:24.200 --> 03:27.409
Isn't that kind of hacktivism
exactly what you did at MIT?

03:27.640 --> 03:31.486
Is it really all that different
from the vigilantism you practice today?

03:32.960 --> 03:34.644
We are the same, you and I.

03:34.800 --> 03:39.203
I am pretty sure that I didn't try to kill
8,000 people.

03:39.440 --> 03:41.761
An empty threat, I swear to you.

03:41.960 --> 03:44.167
I know I have no right.
I'm asking for a chance.

03:44.320 --> 03:47.642
A chance to prove to you
that I'm not a bad guy.

03:47.880 --> 03:50.121
And that I'm not a bad guy.

03:52.160 --> 03:53.161
What is that?

03:53.400 --> 03:55.971
A record of some of the hacks I've done
throughout the years.

03:56.160 --> 03:58.322
I've selected ones that can be verified
by news accounts

03:58.560 --> 04:00.801
so you know I'm telling the truth.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.241
This is very simple for me, Felicity.

04:03.440 --> 04:04.441
I want to be back in your life.

04:04.680 --> 04:07.650
I know that doing that
will require earning your trust back.

04:07.840 --> 04:10.446
I hope this is a first step.

04:11.120 --> 04:12.804
Down that very long road.

04:22.640 --> 04:26.361
So Nyssa's holding Thea's life hostage
until you kill Malcolm Merlyn.

04:26.520 --> 04:29.205
I would be surprised
if she wasn't the daughter of the demon.

04:29.360 --> 04:31.931
- It's not funny, John.
- No. It's not. Thea's dying.

04:32.160 --> 04:33.366
She has one, maybe two days.

04:33.520 --> 04:35.648
And if we can save her
by killing the man that killed my sister,

04:35.840 --> 04:37.205
then how could you
even think twice about that?

04:37.360 --> 04:38.691
I'm not gonna defend Malcolm.

04:38.880 --> 04:41.645
He orchestrated your sister's murder.
He killed Tommy.

04:43.600 --> 04:45.967
Nothing is ever gonna change the fact
that he is Thea's family.

04:46.160 --> 04:49.642
I don't know how much you remember
of my father, but he was not a good man.

04:49.840 --> 04:52.161
He threw in with Malcolm Merlyn.

04:52.360 --> 04:53.521
<i>And all of that being said,</i>

04:53.720 --> 04:56.041
there is nothing that I wouldn't do
to have him back.

04:56.880 --> 04:58.370
So you tell me.

04:58.880 --> 05:00.325
How am I supposed to take that away
from Thea?

05:00.520 --> 05:01.885
But, Oliver,
what's the difference if Thea dies?

05:02.120 --> 05:04.566
Doesn't have to come to that, John.
There's more than one choice here.

05:04.720 --> 05:06.370
- Like what?
- Diplomacy.

05:07.520 --> 05:09.170
What does Nyssa want? I mean...

05:09.520 --> 05:11.488
<i>All Nyssa really wants
is control of the League.</i>

05:11.680 --> 05:14.331
So I need to convince Merlyn
to give her the ring,

05:14.520 --> 05:17.922
she gives us the cure,
and no one has to die.

05:18.680 --> 05:21.570
Laurel, can you convince Nyssa
to go along with that?

05:21.840 --> 05:23.490
Yeah.
It's easier than talking Malcolm into it.

05:23.680 --> 05:25.489
Well, let me worry about Malcolm.

05:29.520 --> 05:31.170
I don't understand.

05:31.720 --> 05:34.326
Why would you save me,
only to kill my brother?

05:35.400 --> 05:38.085
- Vlad attacked me.
- Vlad would never do such a thing.

05:38.320 --> 05:41.449
I was defending myself.
And I did not know he was your brother.

05:41.680 --> 05:43.842
- Would that have made a difference?
- I didn't have a choice.

05:44.040 --> 05:45.769
There is always a choice.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.048
I couldn't just let him kill me.

05:48.280 --> 05:49.441
I'm done with you.

05:49.600 --> 05:52.444
Taiana, I have something
that Reiter wants.

05:55.400 --> 05:57.721
- Where did you get that?
- It doesn't matter.

05:59.760 --> 06:01.683
I think that we can use this against him.

06:01.920 --> 06:03.126
I have a better idea.

06:03.960 --> 06:06.122
Hey. Get Reiter.

06:06.960 --> 06:08.450
Tell him I want to talk to him.

06:08.880 --> 06:10.405
I have something that he wants.

06:20.440 --> 06:21.885
Let me see if I've got this right.

06:22.080 --> 06:24.731
There's a magic potion
that could cure Thea's bloodlust,

06:24.920 --> 06:28.447
that we've never heard of,
but Nyssa conveniently has.

06:29.400 --> 06:31.562
I've been holding off telling you this
for years, Oliver.

06:31.760 --> 06:34.604
You're very handsome,
not especially bright.

06:34.920 --> 06:37.082
Well, bright enough
to have checked.

06:37.280 --> 06:38.884
It's called the Lotus.

06:39.800 --> 06:42.406
Tatsu Yamashiro's part of the order
who guards it.

06:42.640 --> 06:45.405
Or did. They gave it to Nyssa.

06:45.600 --> 06:48.570
And if we don't get her
to give it to Thea now,

06:51.080 --> 06:52.161
we're gonna lose her.

06:52.400 --> 06:54.607
Even assuming such an elixir existed,

06:54.800 --> 06:58.327
even assuming Ms. Yamashiro's order
parted with it willingly,

06:58.520 --> 07:03.287
even assuming Nyssa al Ghul's words
could be trusted, then yes.

07:03.640 --> 07:05.085
Of course I'd do anything
to save my daughter.

07:05.320 --> 07:08.130
But none of that is true, Oliver.

07:08.480 --> 07:11.086
Look, I appreciate
you're trying to embrace

07:11.320 --> 07:13.129
a more optimistic viewpoint these days.

07:13.320 --> 07:15.766
Malcolm, we're talking about
your daughter.

07:15.960 --> 07:17.325
Yes.

07:17.520 --> 07:19.522
And I need to do something to save her.

07:19.760 --> 07:24.004
And you need to stop wasting my time
with Nyssa al Ghul's games.

07:34.200 --> 07:36.726
We found her at the perimeter.
She claims to be a friend.

07:37.120 --> 07:38.451
And she speaks the truth.

07:38.880 --> 07:40.644
At least until she defiled my beloved

07:40.840 --> 07:43.571
and stood idly by
while I was left to rot in a dungeon.

07:44.640 --> 07:45.721
Leave us.

07:50.960 --> 07:52.564
- Nyssa.
- How is my beloved?

07:52.720 --> 07:56.008
Sara's good. She's whole.
I think she's happy.

07:56.400 --> 07:58.562
- If you're here about Thea...
- Nyssa, what are you doing?

07:58.880 --> 08:01.724
- Protecting my birthright.
- By holding Thea's life hostage?

08:02.480 --> 08:05.245
You say that as if she didn't fire
the arrows that felled your sister.

08:05.480 --> 08:07.084
You and I both know that wasn't her doing.

08:07.320 --> 08:08.401
Yes.

08:08.560 --> 08:10.324
It was Malcolm Merlyn.

08:11.080 --> 08:13.082
And the time has come for recompense.

08:13.240 --> 08:16.926
I will never forgive Merlyn for all
the horrible things that he's done.

08:17.080 --> 08:18.605
He's taken people.

08:19.040 --> 08:21.327
Two very special people away from me.

08:21.560 --> 08:24.245
- Don't you think I want him dead?
- Then why are you here?

08:24.440 --> 08:27.205
Because if you want Merlyn dead,
then you have to drive that sword.

08:27.440 --> 08:31.684
And if you can't or if you won't,
then we'll need to negotiate a compromise.

08:35.600 --> 08:36.601
You have my attention.

08:36.840 --> 08:40.128
Oliver convinces Merlyn
to give up the power.

08:40.400 --> 08:41.765
And you...

08:44.039 --> 08:45.610
And you give us the cure.

08:47.440 --> 08:48.930
I would accept those terms.

08:50.120 --> 08:52.248
- But Merlyn never will.
- Let us worry about that.

08:52.440 --> 08:55.728
- And by "Us," you mean my husband.
- Oliver's speaking with Merlyn right now.

08:56.800 --> 08:59.041
And Merlyn, he is a bastard.

08:59.440 --> 09:01.761
But there is nothing that he wouldn't do
to save his daughter.

09:01.960 --> 09:03.371
I hope so.

09:04.400 --> 09:07.290
Because if he doesn't, it won'tjust be
Thea's life that is forfeit.

09:07.560 --> 09:08.561
What do you mean?

09:20.240 --> 09:21.446
There will be war.

09:21.800 --> 09:25.088
And the streets of your home will run red
with the blood of our enemies.

09:26.280 --> 09:28.089
Whomever they may be.

09:36.080 --> 09:39.084
- How'd it go with Merlyn?
- Not good. Nyssa?

09:39.960 --> 09:42.088
She brought an army, but if you go
to the ring, she'll play ball.

09:42.280 --> 09:44.169
We can get this done
with no one getting hurt.

09:45.760 --> 09:48.127
- Everything all right?
- No, not really. I mean, it's not great.

09:48.320 --> 09:51.005
It's just not quite at the level of
"My sister's on her deathbed" kind of bad.

09:51.240 --> 09:53.004
- What happened?
- My dad came back.

09:53.680 --> 09:54.681
And why is that a bad thing?

09:54.920 --> 09:56.081
Well, it's an extremely long story,

09:56.320 --> 09:58.607
but you remember the super-hacker
who blackmailed Roy?

09:58.800 --> 09:59.847
- Same guy.
- What?

10:00.120 --> 10:02.122
- Your father is...
- "The Calculator."

10:02.320 --> 10:04.049
He showed up
at my Palmer Tech presentation.

10:04.320 --> 10:07.210
I had coffee with him yesterday, where he
dropped the Calculator bomb on me.

10:07.360 --> 10:08.361
And why would he do that?

10:08.600 --> 10:12.685
Apparently, now that he knows what I do,
that we're both "vigilantes,"

10:13.480 --> 10:14.811
we have something in common.

10:15.800 --> 10:17.131
The sickest part is I want to believe him.

10:17.320 --> 10:18.526
I wish there was some sort of test

10:18.720 --> 10:20.882
I could do that would prove
that he is who he says he is.

10:21.120 --> 10:24.203
A test is a good idea.
It's a good idea for you and for us.

10:24.560 --> 10:26.688
I've got a way to bring Merlyn
to the bargaining table.

10:30.640 --> 10:33.723
I'm not usually one
to be summoned by my prisoners.

10:36.640 --> 10:38.130
I heard you had something for me?

10:39.120 --> 10:41.566
Taiana, please don't.

10:42.160 --> 10:43.571
I have something you want.

10:43.880 --> 10:45.962
Let me out of this cage, and it's yours.

10:46.200 --> 10:47.850
Show me what you have.

10:55.560 --> 10:56.766
Magnificent.

10:57.160 --> 10:58.400
Do we have a deal?

10:58.760 --> 10:59.921
A deal?

11:01.840 --> 11:05.242
You misunderstood. It's mine either way.

11:07.920 --> 11:10.685
I cannot stay here, Reiter.
This man killed my brother.

11:10.880 --> 11:13.724
And you will continue to care for him
as if he were your brother.

11:13.920 --> 11:17.891
Mr. Queen is an important piece
of my endeavor on this island.

11:18.080 --> 11:19.889
You'll stay with him until he's well.

11:20.080 --> 11:22.367
If his health gets worse,

11:22.920 --> 11:24.604
you'll join him in his fate.

11:49.920 --> 11:51.490
Your left-side block is slow.

11:51.720 --> 11:54.803
Your next opponent won't have my patience,
or my mercy.

11:55.800 --> 11:58.644
Clearly you don't understand how this is
supposed to work, my husband.

11:58.960 --> 12:00.610
You were supposed to bring
the Magician with you.

12:00.800 --> 12:02.882
Well, I need something from you first.

12:03.960 --> 12:07.089
- Proof that what you're offering is real.
- A stalling tactic.

12:07.480 --> 12:10.484
Al Sa-her thinks me the fool.
Or that you're one.

12:10.720 --> 12:14.725
Or maybe he doesn't trust the woman trying
to take the Demon's Head ring from him.

12:16.200 --> 12:17.440
Can't imagine why.

12:18.040 --> 12:20.008
Bring me a sample of the Lotus.

12:23.520 --> 12:25.010
I recognize what you're doing.

12:25.240 --> 12:26.571
Part of me even respects it.

12:26.800 --> 12:29.963
But the leadership of the League of
Assassins is in the balance here.

12:30.200 --> 12:32.931
It is naive to think this can be resolved
without bloodshed.

12:40.600 --> 12:42.887
This amount is not sufficient
to cure her permanently.

12:43.080 --> 12:45.287
Only to provide the assurance
Merlyn seeks.

12:48.040 --> 12:49.405
Thank you, Nyssa.

12:50.600 --> 12:51.840
As I said,

12:52.440 --> 12:53.885
someone is going to die.

12:55.280 --> 12:56.964
I pray it won't be your sister.

13:05.880 --> 13:08.201
Was it difficult to get her discharged
from the hospital?

13:08.640 --> 13:10.290
No. I spoke to Doctor Lamb.

13:11.080 --> 13:12.286
A friend of the family.

13:17.320 --> 13:18.321
Nyssa.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.843
She hooked us up
with a sample of the cure.

13:23.040 --> 13:24.883
This buys Thea some more time.

13:25.680 --> 13:27.205
And you get the proof that you need.

13:27.400 --> 13:28.606
Let's see it.

13:44.240 --> 13:47.130
- What are Nyssa's terms?
- You hand over the ring.

13:48.200 --> 13:50.089
She gives us the rest of the elixir.

13:51.920 --> 13:53.160
And Thea lives.

13:53.360 --> 13:54.441
When can we meet?

13:54.680 --> 13:56.045
Tonight.

13:56.480 --> 13:57.641
Laurel's with her now.

14:06.680 --> 14:08.045
Hi. I got your...

14:08.640 --> 14:09.687
<i>Oh, no.</i>

14:10.520 --> 14:12.966
- Oh, no, you have Mr. Square Bear face.
- What?

14:13.480 --> 14:14.811
Mr. Square Bear. Oh, my God.

14:15.040 --> 14:17.361
You don't remember? You lost him
when you were, like, four years old.

14:17.560 --> 14:22.009
And you had that exact
look on your face. Oh, baby.

14:22.360 --> 14:24.522
Is it too much to hope
that you lost a plushy toy?

14:24.720 --> 14:29.169
No, but adjusting for age,
inflation might be just as bad.

14:30.080 --> 14:31.081
Huh?

14:31.800 --> 14:33.040
You know, sit.

14:34.640 --> 14:36.404
Why, what's up?

14:41.040 --> 14:42.280
It's Dad.

14:43.560 --> 14:46.609
- Noah. He's in Star City.
- What? How do you know?

14:46.920 --> 14:48.490
He came to see me.

14:51.520 --> 14:53.329
- Did you talk to him?
- Yeah.

14:54.120 --> 14:55.451
Are you all right?

14:55.640 --> 14:57.768
Yeah, you sound like you think
he'd hurt me or something.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.081
Yeah.

14:59.440 --> 15:01.920
I've just been doing some checking.
Is it possible that he's not

15:02.720 --> 15:06.247
the guy we thought he was? That maybe he's
better than who we thought he was?

15:06.440 --> 15:07.680
No.

15:09.280 --> 15:11.681
Felicity, I would love to think
that your father didn't show up

15:11.880 --> 15:13.882
with some ulterior motive
in your life right now.

15:14.080 --> 15:16.287
But I've been where you are more times
than I care to admit,

15:16.480 --> 15:18.960
and it always ends the same way.

15:19.160 --> 15:22.482
He tells you exactly what you want to hear
and you get sucked in.

15:23.120 --> 15:25.202
And the next thing you know,
you have no job,

15:25.760 --> 15:27.091
no money,

15:27.320 --> 15:30.005
and a sweet seven-year-old daughter
who needs a new pair of shoes

15:30.240 --> 15:31.651
and wants to go to space camp.

15:33.520 --> 15:36.091
People don't change.

15:37.520 --> 15:39.045
Even if you want them to.

15:41.880 --> 15:43.291
You're doing the right thing.

15:43.680 --> 15:47.048
I'm only entertaining Oliver's naive plan
out of respect for our marriage.

15:48.040 --> 15:50.168
But his hope blinds him to reality.

15:53.080 --> 15:54.684
You've come dressed for battle, Al Sa-her.

15:54.880 --> 15:56.325
Just for the occasion.

15:58.760 --> 16:00.524
In exchange for my daughter's life.

16:03.960 --> 16:05.564
I'm glad you've finally seen reason.

16:05.960 --> 16:09.521
Sadly, the only thing I have seen
is your quick and speedy death.

16:10.760 --> 16:12.285
Malcolm.

16:17.680 --> 16:19.409
I knew you couldn't be trusted.

16:19.600 --> 16:21.682
You knew, and you didn't prepare.

16:22.360 --> 16:27.446
And here you are, outnumbered, outgunned,
outmaneuvered. Per usual.

16:28.360 --> 16:29.441
Nyssa, don't!

16:29.640 --> 16:31.210
Kill him!

16:31.520 --> 16:33.329
We have to stop them
before they kill each other.

16:46.800 --> 16:48.040
Retreat!

16:53.320 --> 16:54.765
Don't let her get away!

16:57.960 --> 16:59.610
Malcolm, stop this, now!

16:59.800 --> 17:01.211
Get out of my way, Oliver.

17:01.400 --> 17:04.801
- Think about Thea.
- Do not question my love for my daughter.

17:05.160 --> 17:07.560
Everything I do, I do it for her.

17:07.920 --> 17:09.160
I'm not moving.

17:22.720 --> 17:24.529
So much for the Gandhi method.

17:25.839 --> 17:27.968
Given who we're dealing with,
we shouldn't be surprised.

17:28.160 --> 17:30.845
I cannot believe that being Ra's al Ghul
is more important to Malcolm

17:31.040 --> 17:32.565
than saving his daughter's life.

17:32.760 --> 17:34.330
I know that you're trying a new approach.

17:34.520 --> 17:37.410
But just because you've changed,
that doesn't mean everybody else has.

17:38.640 --> 17:42.565
We cannot allow a League civil war.
Too many people will be collateral damage.

17:42.760 --> 17:45.570
And the four of us definitely can't take
on two armies of assassins.

17:45.760 --> 17:47.330
Then we take down the generals.

17:47.520 --> 17:49.249
We need to work on
locating Nyssa and Malcolm.

17:49.440 --> 17:52.523
But mainly Nyssa. Because she's got
the whole Lotus cure thing.

17:52.720 --> 17:54.085
We find both of them.

17:54.360 --> 17:55.566
No one else dies tonight.

17:57.720 --> 17:59.370
Especially Thea.

18:07.720 --> 18:09.449
You need this to keep your fever at bay.

18:10.000 --> 18:13.049
If it comes back,
well, that would be very bad.

18:13.360 --> 18:14.691
I'm surprised you still care.

18:14.880 --> 18:17.884
Baron Reiter made it very clear
what happens to me if you die.

18:18.120 --> 18:19.929
Taiana, I know what you're going through.

18:21.240 --> 18:24.323
It's this feeling
in the pit of your stomach.

18:24.840 --> 18:26.842
Just emptiness.

18:27.080 --> 18:31.244
Don't you dare try to help me
mourn my brother, that you took from me.

18:31.440 --> 18:34.091
- Please, just listen...
- You know nothing about how I feel.

18:35.080 --> 18:38.766
A man with a heart as small as yours
is incapable of such things.

18:40.480 --> 18:42.608
My father sacrificed himself.

18:44.080 --> 18:45.366
So I could survive.

18:46.520 --> 18:48.204
So that I could right his wrongs.

18:48.480 --> 18:50.448
He did it by pulling out a gun

18:52.600 --> 18:57.083
and shooting himself in the head,
not three feet from me.

18:59.680 --> 19:01.648
Since that day, I have lost

19:03.720 --> 19:05.882
four more people that I love.

19:07.520 --> 19:10.285
That I cared so much about.
It never gets easier.

19:12.280 --> 19:14.726
- Even
- I could see it in your eyes.

19:16.080 --> 19:17.605
From the moment we first met.

19:18.040 --> 19:19.610
That I was good?

19:20.040 --> 19:21.201
No.

19:21.800 --> 19:23.131
That you were lost.

19:23.640 --> 19:24.641
Shattered.

19:27.200 --> 19:28.645
There is a Russian saying.

19:32.840 --> 19:36.401
"The same hammer that shatters glass,
forges steel."

19:36.840 --> 19:39.650
If you want to be the man
that your father wishes you to be,

19:39.960 --> 19:41.485
then this is how you get there.

19:41.680 --> 19:43.603
You save us from Reiter.

19:45.360 --> 19:47.931
But you cannot do that shattered.

19:57.480 --> 20:00.290
Hey. Everyone's telling the same story.

20:00.480 --> 20:03.768
- Guys in black robes fighting each other.
- Yeah. League of Assassins.

20:03.960 --> 20:05.371
They're working out
some leadership issues.

20:05.600 --> 20:07.682
Yeah, but how many more people
are gonna die before that happens?

20:07.880 --> 20:10.645
- Yeah. We're working on it.
- You gotta work faster.

20:10.960 --> 20:12.530
Or this is just the beginning.

20:13.200 --> 20:15.680
- Hey.
- Think we need to talk.

20:16.680 --> 20:18.967
- About what?
- About the elephant in the room.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.446
The way this is going down,
it ends one way.

20:22.760 --> 20:24.285
Malcolm Merlyn.

20:24.680 --> 20:27.604
He has to be taken down, Oliver.
You're the only man who's ever done it.

20:27.800 --> 20:31.043
Malcolm's killed hundreds of people.
He killed Tommy, he killed Sara.

20:31.440 --> 20:34.683
Thea is dying right now
because of events that he set in motion.

20:34.920 --> 20:38.208
I have never hated anyone
the way that I hate him.

20:38.400 --> 20:40.641
You've been in denial, Oliver.

20:41.320 --> 20:44.483
Holding on to hope with both hands that
you don't have to give in to that hate.

20:44.720 --> 20:47.200
Use that hate to do what needs to be done.

20:47.400 --> 20:50.802
But, Oliver, this needs to be done.

20:52.520 --> 20:54.124
You have to kill Malcolm Merlyn.

20:58.160 --> 20:59.321
I'm glad you called.

20:59.520 --> 21:03.002
Well, all your files checked out.
And I did some additional digging myself.

21:03.240 --> 21:04.366
You're right.

21:04.560 --> 21:07.006
You and I, we're not all that different.

21:09.360 --> 21:11.681
This facility is really amazing.

21:11.880 --> 21:13.882
Yes. After numerous false starts,

21:14.120 --> 21:16.521
we finally got the R&D section
working like a Swiss watch.

21:16.720 --> 21:20.042
This floor contains
most of our bleeding-edge projects. Ah.

21:22.200 --> 21:24.567
That is an autonomous
communications device.

21:24.800 --> 21:26.370
Three generations beyond Bluetooth.

21:26.560 --> 21:28.722
- But there are no seams in the casing.
- I know.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.286
It's milled
from a single piece of aluminum.

21:30.480 --> 21:32.926
The entire surface
connects to an induction charger.

21:33.120 --> 21:34.531
How did you achieve the heat sink?

21:34.720 --> 21:37.405
Curtis Holt achieved it, actually.
He's quite the genius.

21:37.720 --> 21:40.564
Don't sell yourself short.
You're the Steve Jobs in this equation.

21:41.960 --> 21:44.406
Thank you for agreeing
to give me a second chance.

21:44.680 --> 21:45.886
Baby steps, then.

21:48.160 --> 21:49.366
Baby steps.

21:58.120 --> 21:59.451
I have eyes on Nyssa.

22:00.280 --> 22:01.850
Abandoned complex at Seventh and Rucka.

22:02.040 --> 22:04.964
Put the word out
among our assets in Star City.

22:05.440 --> 22:08.046
Whoever leads us to Al Sa-her
will be rewarded handsomely.

22:08.240 --> 22:10.083
<i>Keep</i> her there. We're on our way.

22:12.080 --> 22:14.447
- Nyssa, stop.
- Step aside, Laurel.

22:14.680 --> 22:16.523
I will not let you wage a war in my city.

22:16.720 --> 22:19.690
I bargained in good faith.
I'm only finishing what he started.

22:19.880 --> 22:22.087
- And I aim to end it swiftly.
- At what cost?

22:22.280 --> 22:24.408
How many lives will you sacrifice?
For what?

22:24.600 --> 22:27.763
I will only say this once more.
Step aside.

22:27.960 --> 22:30.486
- No. You're coming with me.
- Am I?

22:33.520 --> 22:34.851
We're under attack.

22:41.760 --> 22:43.285
We have to get out of here.

22:43.680 --> 22:45.011
Run!

23:16.160 --> 23:18.401
Go. Get inside.

23:50.160 --> 23:52.242
Cowards. Just like their master.

23:52.440 --> 23:53.930
- Sorry, Nyssa.
- For what?

23:58.400 --> 23:59.606
For that.

24:07.720 --> 24:10.530
I was in a cell much like this one
barely a year ago.

24:12.080 --> 24:14.321
Nyssa, where is the Lotus?

24:14.520 --> 24:15.681
Safe.

24:16.200 --> 24:17.725
This isn't a game, Nyssa.

24:18.080 --> 24:21.721
Thea is dying. Innocent civilians
are dying. Your own men are dying.

24:21.920 --> 24:23.968
And surrendering my only leverage
will not save their lives.

24:24.160 --> 24:25.889
No. But it'll save Thea's.

24:28.440 --> 24:30.204
How could you be so selfish?

24:30.560 --> 24:31.891
A question better put to Malcolm Merlyn.

24:32.080 --> 24:34.082
He doesn't have the cure. You do.

24:35.680 --> 24:39.287
Using Thea's life as a bargaining chip,
letting people die for a lost cause?

24:39.480 --> 24:41.323
Nyssa, this isn't who you are.

24:42.840 --> 24:44.524
It's who your father was.

24:45.520 --> 24:47.124
But he's gone. He's dead.

24:47.720 --> 24:50.007
And you can finally be free.

25:00.240 --> 25:01.446
Any luck?

25:01.880 --> 25:03.370
Malcolm and the League
have gone to ground.

25:03.600 --> 25:07.491
Nyssa is a brick wall. John and Laurel
are out searching for the Lotus,

25:07.680 --> 25:09.250
but we

25:09.480 --> 25:11.084
are running out of places to look.

25:11.600 --> 25:13.728
- That's depressing.
- Well, we will find it.

25:14.640 --> 25:16.768
- We have to.
- Mmm-hmm.

25:17.480 --> 25:19.482
- Is everything all right?
- Not really.

25:20.280 --> 25:24.490
I mean, it's not as bad as your sister
being unconscious in our sub-level, but...

25:25.600 --> 25:27.045
Did something happen with your dad?

25:27.240 --> 25:29.402
More like something didn't happen.

25:31.440 --> 25:32.885
What's that?

25:33.920 --> 25:35.251
It's an IR burst receiver.

25:36.680 --> 25:38.364
Incredibly advanced.

25:38.800 --> 25:42.088
It can suck the data out of any room
you put it in to.

25:42.720 --> 25:45.200
Don't worry, I turned it off
before bringing it down here.

25:45.400 --> 25:47.209
- It's not yours?
- It's my father's.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.162
I gave him a little tour
of Curtis' R&D lab,

25:51.400 --> 25:52.925
and he left this behind as a souvenir.

25:53.120 --> 25:54.929
He's trying to steal from Palmer Tech?

25:55.360 --> 25:56.646
It's your idea, actually.

25:57.480 --> 26:00.006
You needed proof about the Lotus.
I needed proof about my dad.

26:00.240 --> 26:01.765
You set a trap for him as a test?

26:01.960 --> 26:06.602
Unrestricted access to Palmer Technologies
R&D lab. He flunked with flying colors.

26:07.680 --> 26:08.920
I don't even know why I'm surprised.

26:09.120 --> 26:11.361
You're surprised because you're hoping

26:12.280 --> 26:14.442
that he's the parent
you've always wanted him to be.

26:15.480 --> 26:16.606
A parent you deserve.

26:16.840 --> 26:21.801
In an extremely ironic role reversal,
my mother was smarter than me. She said,

26:22.360 --> 26:25.250
"People don't change."

26:26.840 --> 26:28.126
"No matter how much you want them to."

26:28.320 --> 26:30.129
- Some people don't.
- Uh-huh.

26:30.440 --> 26:32.681
I'd like to think that there's hope
for the rest of us.

26:34.520 --> 26:37.842
Or I did. As far as Malcolm is concerned.

26:39.040 --> 26:40.326
John thinks I should kill him.

26:40.520 --> 26:41.646
If it helps save Thea, I agree.

26:41.840 --> 26:44.525
Yeah, and I agree
if he wasn't Thea's father, but he is.

26:44.720 --> 26:47.883
We are in this mess because of him on,
like, a million different levels.

26:48.120 --> 26:51.044
Let's not pretend that this is a typical
father-daughter relationship.

26:51.240 --> 26:55.370
- He brainwashed her into killing a friend.
- I know all this.

26:56.360 --> 26:58.408
I do. And I'm still

26:58.840 --> 27:00.729
holding out hope that with...

27:01.520 --> 27:05.002
With time, and with how much
he says that he loves her,

27:05.240 --> 27:09.450
that maybe they have some chance
at some type of normal relationship.

27:10.160 --> 27:11.605
If I kill him,

27:13.840 --> 27:15.524
my sister never gets that chance.

27:15.760 --> 27:18.081
Thea's father is no more likely to change
than mine is.

27:19.880 --> 27:21.041
What now?

27:23.000 --> 27:24.411
- Found Malcolm.
- Where?

27:24.880 --> 27:26.405
Right underneath us.

27:29.560 --> 27:31.005
Malcolm.

27:32.600 --> 27:34.204
The Lotus effect is wearing off.

27:35.840 --> 27:38.810
She will pass by sunrise.
I would like to be by her side.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.411
This has to end.

27:41.080 --> 27:44.402
No more games.
You give Nyssa the damn ring!

27:45.080 --> 27:47.003
She was four months old when we first met.

27:49.240 --> 27:50.765
<i>Your housekeeper, Reuse,</i>

27:51.720 --> 27:56.248
I believe, was picking you up
from our house with Thea in a stroller.

27:56.880 --> 27:58.882
I peeked my head into the bassinet,

27:59.920 --> 28:01.081
and Thea,

28:02.040 --> 28:03.530
all of 16 weeks,

28:04.920 --> 28:06.888
she stuck her tongue out at me.

28:10.040 --> 28:11.280
I always knew I was

28:12.000 --> 28:13.126
connected to her.

28:13.320 --> 28:18.167
As if on some primal level,
I knew I was her father.

28:19.200 --> 28:24.161
A real father wouldn't let their child die
just to keep his hands on power.

28:24.480 --> 28:25.970
That is not what I am doing.

28:26.440 --> 28:30.843
What's unfolding here is larger than I.
And it is bigger than my daughter.

28:31.040 --> 28:33.168
It's not just her life
that hangs in the balance, Oliver.

28:33.360 --> 28:35.522
For all your dealings with the League,

28:37.680 --> 28:40.411
you still remain ignorant
to what it is they do for the world.

28:40.600 --> 28:43.046
Enough about the League.
You're a group of assassins.

28:43.480 --> 28:45.244
It is a force of change.

28:45.680 --> 28:48.968
Silently manipulating global events
for hundreds of years.

28:49.160 --> 28:51.640
And I cannot, I will not

28:51.840 --> 28:55.481
put that kind of power
into Nyssa al Ghul's hands!

28:57.320 --> 28:58.321
Let me ask you something.

28:58.520 --> 29:02.844
If Damien Darhk came to you
and told you to lay down your bow,

29:03.000 --> 29:06.686
let him finish his plan for Star City,
would you do it?

29:08.320 --> 29:10.209
Even if it meant saving William's life?

29:15.680 --> 29:17.523
I know everything about you, Oliver.

29:19.920 --> 29:21.684
I am Ra's al Ghul.

29:22.760 --> 29:24.410
But back to the matter at hand.

29:24.600 --> 29:27.843
You will never sacrifice your city
to save your son.

29:28.000 --> 29:32.050
And believe me when I tell you
that I am only making the same choice.

29:32.200 --> 29:33.690
I would look for another choice.

29:33.840 --> 29:37.367
And I wouldn't stop looking
until there was a third option!

29:39.040 --> 29:43.887
Malcolm, what if you could have the Lotus

29:45.600 --> 29:48.046
- and keep your ring?
- I don't see how.

29:49.520 --> 29:52.046
Nyssa's forces are stronger
than I care to admit.

29:52.200 --> 29:53.565
Not by herself.

29:53.720 --> 29:56.644
You challenge her to a trial by combat.

29:56.880 --> 29:59.201
You do realize your plan
would end in her death.

30:02.560 --> 30:04.642
We're all backed into a corner, Malcolm.

30:06.480 --> 30:07.811
Nyssa made her bed.

30:14.600 --> 30:17.444
This is one of your crazier ideas,
and that is a competitive field.

30:17.640 --> 30:20.246
Well, sit tight.
I have a crazier one coming.

30:29.160 --> 30:33.085
In deference to good taste,
we will forgo the removal of shirts.

30:34.240 --> 30:36.163
Let us be finished with the charade.

30:37.080 --> 30:38.320
As you wish.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.286
<i>Hold!</i>

30:53.120 --> 30:54.804
In the eyes of the League,

30:55.680 --> 30:57.011
this woman is my wife.

30:59.680 --> 31:01.523
As your husband,

31:02.880 --> 31:04.848
I wish to fight on her behalf.

31:14.960 --> 31:17.122
I have never allowed anyone
to fight my battles for me.

31:17.320 --> 31:19.209
Do you want to become Ra's
or do you want to die?

31:19.480 --> 31:20.811
- Why are you doing this?
- You told me yourself,

31:20.960 --> 31:23.804
you couldn't defeat Merlyn.
And if I am forced to choose

31:24.800 --> 31:26.325
between your life and his...

31:29.120 --> 31:30.690
Then I will see justice done.

31:42.080 --> 31:44.003
I'm a little disappointed, I must say.

31:44.160 --> 31:46.640
You're the one who put us
in this position, Malcolm.

31:46.840 --> 31:51.164
Can I remind you the role you played
in putting this ring on my finger?

31:51.320 --> 31:53.084
No, I remember.

31:54.480 --> 31:56.881
- Tonight I correct that mistake.
- I can't believe it.

31:58.720 --> 32:01.883
You've grown even more foolish
with experience.

32:02.080 --> 32:04.003
Three years!

32:06.080 --> 32:07.570
Let's finish this.

32:34.880 --> 32:36.882
Last chance, Malcolm. Yield!

32:37.040 --> 32:38.929
Never. To end this,

32:39.880 --> 32:41.370
you must kill me.

32:43.360 --> 32:45.089
But you always knew that, Oliver.

32:45.400 --> 32:46.561
I didn't want it to end this way.

32:46.760 --> 32:49.411
Spare me your false sympathy. Just do it.

33:33.440 --> 33:35.090
Bring me the Lotus.

33:48.520 --> 33:50.010
You are Ra's al Ghul.

33:50.480 --> 33:52.050
Thank you, husband.

34:01.440 --> 34:03.283
Ra's.

34:17.199 --> 34:20.726
What? What is going on?
Is everything okay?

34:21.480 --> 34:23.164
That, uh, depends.

34:24.320 --> 34:26.163
- How are you feeling?
- Uh...

34:27.400 --> 34:30.563
I'm a bit tired, but...

34:32.239 --> 34:34.561
- What am I doing here?
- Yeah. It's a long story.

34:34.840 --> 34:37.081
- But to shorthand it...
- Is that you're gonna be fine.

34:38.159 --> 34:39.730
The cure worked.

34:40.000 --> 34:41.331
No more bloodlust.

34:41.719 --> 34:44.485
Come on. Let's go get you
into some regular clothes.

34:44.880 --> 34:46.245
Yeah.

34:49.840 --> 34:52.684
Oliver, you did it, man. Thea's fine.

34:53.920 --> 34:55.603
And Nyssa and Merlyn didn't have to die.

34:55.880 --> 34:56.927
Ooh, yeah, not to be the buzzkill,

34:57.160 --> 34:59.401
but when are we going to tell
Thea about Malcolm's...

35:00.200 --> 35:01.690
- Baby steps.
- Right.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.526
- What's up?
- Something my father said.

35:09.040 --> 35:10.849
I brought you a portable ramp.

35:11.120 --> 35:14.249
So, any time you come across
a higher surface, just unfold it.

35:14.880 --> 35:16.689
This'll get you over almost anything.

35:16.920 --> 35:18.445
Look, I have a meeting in a few.

35:20.080 --> 35:22.287
- I just wanted to say goodbye.
- "Goodbye"?

35:23.040 --> 35:25.042
We were just starting
to get to know each other.

35:25.200 --> 35:27.089
I think I know everything I need to know.

35:27.400 --> 35:28.811
Felicity, what is going on?

35:29.720 --> 35:31.370
I thought we were making progress.

35:31.560 --> 35:34.564
When I was a girl, I hated myself.
I thought I was broken.

35:34.880 --> 35:36.882
That no one could or ever would love me.

35:37.040 --> 35:39.930
It's the only way a child can grow up
when their father abandons them.

35:40.640 --> 35:43.166
- Felicity.
- All I ever wanted to know was why?

35:43.560 --> 35:46.609
What was so wrong with me
that you would leave?

35:46.800 --> 35:49.326
There was nothing wrong with you,
sweetheart.

35:50.640 --> 35:52.005
But there was everything wrong with me.

35:52.240 --> 35:55.084
The police, the FBI. They were never
going to stop looking for me.

35:56.240 --> 36:00.450
I realized a life on the run, that wasn't
the life that I owed you or your mother.

36:01.840 --> 36:03.171
So I disappeared.

36:03.400 --> 36:05.243
You thought you were doing
the right thing for us.

36:05.400 --> 36:06.606
Exactly.

36:07.160 --> 36:10.642
I have waited my entire life
for that explanation.

36:11.920 --> 36:14.844
And the thing is,
I don't even know if believe it.

36:15.080 --> 36:16.127
It's the truth.

36:16.360 --> 36:18.761
There is only one part of your story
that I know to be true.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.287
And that is
that you are wanted by the police.

36:24.640 --> 36:26.847
- Felicity.
- I just need you to know one thing.

36:27.200 --> 36:28.361
You were wrong.

36:29.120 --> 36:30.281
I am nothing like you.

36:30.440 --> 36:31.521
<i>Felicity.</i>

36:31.760 --> 36:32.841
<i>Noah Kuttler,
you're under arrest.</i>

36:33.120 --> 36:35.771
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

36:35.960 --> 36:38.008
No. No, don't. Don't do this.

36:38.280 --> 36:39.281
Felicity.

36:43.960 --> 36:45.450
Thank you both for coming.

36:46.800 --> 36:47.801
How is Thea?

36:48.000 --> 36:50.128
- Don't pretend like you care.
- I do.

36:50.640 --> 36:52.130
She's my sister-in-law.

36:52.480 --> 36:55.051
And her condition
is the result of my father's blade.

36:55.280 --> 36:58.807
You were right. Even after his death,
I remained my father's prisoner.

36:59.160 --> 37:02.881
I allowed him to turn me into someone
you showed me I don't have to be.

37:05.880 --> 37:08.804
And you showed me as well when you took up
the sword to save my life.

37:10.640 --> 37:14.281
You both showed me what needed to be done.

37:14.600 --> 37:15.681
And what's that?

37:15.960 --> 37:17.883
Patience, please.
We're waiting for one other.

37:20.200 --> 37:21.850
Thank you for coming, Al Sa-her.

37:22.040 --> 37:24.327
You're Ra's. I had no choice.

37:24.600 --> 37:26.523
And so, you are mistaken once again.

37:30.800 --> 37:32.450
What are you doing?

37:45.120 --> 37:47.726
Earlier today,
I disbanded the League of Assassins.

37:48.840 --> 37:52.890
I released its forces, much as my father
had released you long ago.

37:55.360 --> 37:58.648
No one will be held prisoner
by my father any longer.

38:08.360 --> 38:10.203
I thought of you as a son once, Oliver.

38:11.520 --> 38:14.364
I had more in common with you
than my own blood.

38:15.840 --> 38:19.049
But that's not the reason
why I'm not going to kill you.

38:19.240 --> 38:23.211
Neither the fact that you are
my daughter's brother.

38:23.400 --> 38:24.731
The reason you get to live

38:24.920 --> 38:30.211
is because death would be a mercy
compared to the debt I now owe you.

38:31.560 --> 38:34.245
Don't you dare threaten me, Malcolm.

38:40.560 --> 38:42.449
Taiana.

38:43.680 --> 38:46.081
I promise I will free your friends.

38:47.520 --> 38:50.046
- For Vlad.
- Vlad is dead.

38:51.400 --> 38:52.765
We do this for them.

38:54.080 --> 38:55.605
Mr. Queen.

38:55.960 --> 38:58.088
I hope you have regained your strength.

38:58.600 --> 39:01.080
The stone you gave me
was the final piece of the puzzle.

39:01.240 --> 39:02.605
The final map.

39:02.920 --> 39:05.082
- We are going to dig.
- Dig?

39:05.280 --> 39:09.763
The heaven I seek is not above,
but rather beneath our feet.

39:11.080 --> 39:12.764
We dig at daybreak.

39:19.600 --> 39:20.761
Hey-

39:21.760 --> 39:24.445
- You feeling any better?
- I don't even know why I'm so upset.

39:26.440 --> 39:29.569
Doesn't every long-awaited father-daughter
reunion end with the dad being taken away

39:29.800 --> 39:31.962
- in handcuffs?
- You don't have to be funny for me.

39:33.280 --> 39:35.248
- You know that, right?
- I know.

39:37.120 --> 39:38.804
And I know I did the right thing, but...

39:40.480 --> 39:42.960
The look on his face when he realized
I had turned him in,

39:43.320 --> 39:45.004
that's going to haunt me
for the rest of my life.

39:45.440 --> 39:48.011
And I can't help but think he doesn't even
deserve that kind of remorse.

39:48.280 --> 39:50.328
I think that remorse
is a pretty clear indicator

39:50.480 --> 39:53.211
that you are a very different person
than him.

39:53.440 --> 39:56.284
Maybe Thea and I could make t-shirts.
We could join a club.

39:58.040 --> 39:59.644
Listen to me.
Don't make the mistake of thinking

39:59.800 --> 40:01.325
that this thing with your dad is over.

40:01.480 --> 40:04.484
I can tell you from experience

40:05.360 --> 40:07.647
that closure does not come that easily.

40:10.360 --> 40:11.850
Speaking of closure,

40:12.040 --> 40:14.202
are you punishing yourself
for betraying Malcolm?

40:14.680 --> 40:16.330
- Is that insane?
- Yes.

40:17.040 --> 40:19.281
But it's part of what makes you
the man I love.

40:19.680 --> 40:20.841
John was right.

40:21.000 --> 40:22.684
You were faced with
an impossible situation

40:22.880 --> 40:25.008
and you found the best way out of it.

40:30.160 --> 40:31.525
Will you marry me?

40:32.240 --> 40:33.969
I think I already answered that question.

40:34.200 --> 40:38.842
Thea's better. Andy's better.
Things are quiet on the Darhk front.

40:39.040 --> 40:41.520
I feel like this might be our window.

40:41.680 --> 40:44.160
And with everything that we have gone
through over the past few months,

40:44.360 --> 40:45.725
I want you to tell me,

40:47.080 --> 40:49.686
- why are we waiting?
- Well, we'll have to plan it.

40:49.920 --> 40:50.921
Mmm-hmm.

40:51.200 --> 40:54.727
Maybe just a small ceremony with a few
of our friends, and no caterers.

40:54.880 --> 40:57.008
My mom will hate that.

40:58.880 --> 41:00.564
- I'm in. Mmm-hmm.
- Yeah?

41:09.720 --> 41:12.371
- I don't like to be kept waiting.
- My apologies.

41:13.400 --> 41:15.084
I don't have the resources I once had.

41:15.360 --> 41:17.840
Yes. I'm aware
of your recent reversal of fortune.

41:18.040 --> 41:19.565
I take it
that's why you asked for this meeting?

41:19.720 --> 41:21.404
Well, I haven't come empty-handed.

41:21.600 --> 41:23.090
Soto speak.

41:25.080 --> 41:28.402
I have some information that you
might find of particular interest.

41:29.240 --> 41:33.086
I know who Oliver Queen cares about
more than anyone in the whole world.

41:33.400 --> 41:36.244
Yeah, so do I. We did a pretty good number
on her over the holidays.

41:36.440 --> 41:38.249
It's not Felicity Smoak.

41:44.920 --> 41:46.046
Who?

41:46.240 --> 41:47.446
His son.

41:48.640 --> 41:50.051
William.

42:21.440 --> 42:22.441
