23:04.259 --> 23:06.429
- What?
- Well, I was just gonna add...

23:06.761 --> 23:08.971
According to this book I read,
published in 1809,

23:09.055 --> 23:11.885
they didn't just tie
Elly Kedward to a tree.

23:11.975 --> 23:14.688
I mean, they did tie her to a tree,
but they tied her up really high

23:14.769 --> 23:18.020
and they strung these heavy rocks to her
arms and legs as weights, stretching her.

23:18.106 --> 23:19.226
Ugh.

23:19.316 --> 23:21.356
They left her to die on a makeshift rack.

23:21.443 --> 23:22.993

there's been a curse on these woods.

23:27.657 --> 23:29.697

directly at the witch

you'll die just from the fright of it.

That's why Rustin Parr
stood in that corner.
