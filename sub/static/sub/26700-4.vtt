WEBVTT

00:00.260 --> 00:02.039
Previously on Legacies...

00:02.040 --> 00:04.149
You know, I opened this
school to protect these kids.

00:04.150 --> 00:06.529
How am I supposed to
protect them from stuff

00:06.530 --> 00:08.790
that's not supposed to exist?

00:08.800 --> 00:11.568
Landon was inside the walls
of this school because of me.

00:11.570 --> 00:14.130
He had access to the knife
he stole because of me.

00:14.140 --> 00:16.850
Whoever wields it has the
power to save the world,

00:16.860 --> 00:19.010
or end all life as we know it.

00:19.020 --> 00:21.020
A Neanderthal from Mystic Falls High

00:21.030 --> 00:23.110
assaulted me with a milkshake.

00:23.120 --> 00:24.810
So let's do what we got to do here.

00:24.820 --> 00:26.520
Then let's go back to school.

00:26.530 --> 00:29.329
- They don't want me there.
- I am not going without you.

00:29.330 --> 00:30.860
All in.

00:30.870 --> 00:35.030
- Kaleb, what are you doing?
- Look, we homies, right?

00:35.040 --> 00:37.700
And I ain't hurting
anybody. Secret's ours?

00:37.710 --> 00:40.510
- Why isn't she moving?
- The statue hurt her.

00:41.880 --> 00:43.850
Sasha, what are you doing?

00:45.000 --> 00:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:04.319 --> 01:06.980
Come on, man. I'm the lovable virgin.

01:06.990 --> 01:08.780
It's not my time.

01:10.230 --> 01:12.709
I'm gonna open my eyes, and
everything's gonna be fine.

01:12.710 --> 01:15.069
Opening my eyes in three,

01:15.070 --> 01:17.759
two, one.

01:44.600 --> 01:46.670
GhostFace?!

02:17.510 --> 02:18.879
Boo.

02:18.880 --> 02:20.289
Aah!

02:20.290 --> 02:23.519
- Come on, man.
- Sorry, bruh. Too easy.

02:23.520 --> 02:26.809
Oh.

02:26.810 --> 02:28.809
Where were you?

02:28.810 --> 02:30.569
Just got a little peckish.

02:30.570 --> 02:32.719
Went out for a midnight snack.

02:34.750 --> 02:36.320
Oh.

02:38.660 --> 02:40.329
We good?

02:40.330 --> 02:42.849
- Yup. All good.
- Good.

02:45.040 --> 02:47.140
Night, then.

03:10.370 --> 03:12.439
Given our recent influx of monsters,

03:12.440 --> 03:15.559
Sheriff Donovan and I have decided
we need to take drastic action.

03:15.560 --> 03:17.579
Please give him your full attention.

03:17.580 --> 03:19.779
Like Dr. Saltzman was
saying, local girls

03:19.780 --> 03:23.199
Dana Lilien and Sasha Stoteraux
didn't come home last night.

03:23.200 --> 03:26.189
Dana sometimes skips town
for a few days to party,

03:26.190 --> 03:28.980
but this is a first for Sasha.

03:31.500 --> 03:33.199
Thank you, Sheriff Donovan.

03:33.200 --> 03:35.039
Now while the knife is away with Dorian

03:35.040 --> 03:36.619
and things are quiet on his end,

03:36.620 --> 03:38.780
it won't hurt to assume the worst.

03:38.790 --> 03:41.899
- If Dana and Sasha...
- ...Dude, if you don't stop mugging me.

03:41.900 --> 03:43.409
You heard Ol' Blue Eyes.

03:43.410 --> 03:45.239
Dana has a history of running away.

03:45.240 --> 03:47.199
I saw you feed on her.

03:47.200 --> 03:48.339
Yeah, feed.

03:48.340 --> 03:50.989
Not kidnap. MG, I'm telling you...

03:50.990 --> 03:53.889
Vampire to vampire... This ain't on me.

03:53.890 --> 03:56.259
Now, I'll need a few of you to volunteer

03:56.260 --> 04:00.099
to go to Mystic Falls High under
the guise of an exchange program

04:00.100 --> 04:02.530
meant to improve relations
between our schools,

04:02.540 --> 04:06.520
which, unfortunately, is
necessary, given recent events.

04:06.540 --> 04:10.979
Now, I give you permission to
compel them, to gather materials

04:10.980 --> 04:13.129
for locator spells,
because any information

04:13.130 --> 04:15.320
we can get will make all the difference.

04:15.330 --> 04:19.740
Well, I guess that I can
set aside my differences

04:19.750 --> 04:21.428
with Dana for a day,

04:21.430 --> 04:24.829
because that is what heroes do.

04:26.190 --> 04:30.069
So... I volunteer as tribute.

04:30.070 --> 04:32.899
She battles

04:32.900 --> 04:35.559
one gargoyle, and suddenly,
she's Mother Teresa.

04:35.560 --> 04:38.489
You're gonna be real embarrassed
when I prove you wrong.

04:38.490 --> 04:39.959
I'm in.

04:39.960 --> 04:41.459
I'm in, too.

04:43.300 --> 04:44.730
I'd like to help.

04:46.620 --> 04:48.299
Who are you,

04:48.300 --> 04:50.379
and what have you done
with Hope Mikaelson?

04:51.520 --> 04:52.949
I never got to go to a real school.

04:52.950 --> 04:55.139
I've always wanted to know what it's
like to be a normal for a day instead

04:55.140 --> 04:56.989
of being a tri-brid loner.

04:56.990 --> 04:59.159
Yeah, well, that's a bed
you made for yourself.

04:59.160 --> 05:01.679
Not looking for a social lecture.

05:01.680 --> 05:03.670
So, what's your plan with Landon?

05:03.680 --> 05:05.280
Does he, like, go here now?

05:05.290 --> 05:07.079
Why? You still thinking
about murdering him?

05:09.290 --> 05:11.499
'Cause there's a knife that
sat dormant for centuries

05:11.500 --> 05:13.339
that started attracting
mythical creatures

05:13.340 --> 05:15.500
the day he took possession of it.

05:16.460 --> 05:18.450
I'd say there's a lot we
need to learn about him.

05:19.790 --> 05:21.619
And then what? We kick him to the curb?

05:21.620 --> 05:24.079
Then we decide to do what's best

05:24.080 --> 05:26.539
- for the people of this school.
- Any idea what to do with him

05:26.540 --> 05:28.409
while we search for missing mean girls?

05:28.410 --> 05:32.319
As a matter of fact, yes.

05:34.150 --> 05:36.360
Did they say anything about me?

05:36.370 --> 05:38.549
No, not yet.

05:38.550 --> 05:39.989
Everybody's been talking

05:39.990 --> 05:42.009
about some missing girls
from your old high school.

05:42.010 --> 05:43.469
Well, do you think
they're gonna kick me out?

05:43.470 --> 05:44.639
They gave you some clothes.

05:44.640 --> 05:47.689
- I think that's a good sign.
- From 1993.

05:47.690 --> 05:50.439
Come on, man. We have both been places

05:50.440 --> 05:51.919
where nobody has wanted us before.

05:51.920 --> 05:53.799
- You know the drill.
- Yeah. Keep my head down,

05:53.800 --> 05:56.529
- make myself useful, don't pick fights.
- Exactly.

05:56.530 --> 05:59.009
We need today to go well, Ian.

05:59.010 --> 06:00.679
No, we need this to go perfect.

06:00.680 --> 06:03.180
Otherwise, I'm as good as gone.

06:03.190 --> 06:05.670
Landon. You have a minute?

06:07.560 --> 06:10.059
I think you might be of some use today.

06:11.940 --> 06:14.159
Mystic Falls, we got claws.

06:14.160 --> 06:16.079
On the field, you'll hear us roar. Rawr!

06:41.380 --> 06:43.439
Sorry. Sorry.

06:44.610 --> 06:47.759
I was making an entrance, mophead.

06:47.760 --> 06:49.239
Sorry. I just had a...

06:49.240 --> 06:51.249
a flashback to my freshman year here.

06:51.250 --> 06:56.599
Girls are missing, so get your
wedgie trauma in check or leave.

06:56.600 --> 06:58.780
He's fine now. Let it go.

06:58.790 --> 07:00.680
Okay, here's the deal.

07:00.690 --> 07:02.359
Landon, you talk to any of the people

07:02.360 --> 07:04.149
you still know from when you went here.

07:04.150 --> 07:07.819
Hope, you try to not
deliberately alienate

07:07.820 --> 07:11.299
the entire student body while
the rest of us save the world.

07:11.300 --> 07:13.739
- This isn't a contest, Lizzie.
- You're right.

07:13.740 --> 07:15.549
It's a mission

07:15.550 --> 07:17.839
for a hero and her league of...

07:17.840 --> 07:19.979
- whatevers.
- Yeah.

07:19.980 --> 07:21.689
Screw that. I work alone.

07:21.690 --> 07:23.820
MG, I need your compulsion skills.

07:23.830 --> 07:26.800
Would you like to be
the Robin to my Batwoman?

07:26.810 --> 07:28.889
Actually, Batwoman doesn't have a Robin.

07:28.890 --> 07:30.780
- She...
- Metaphor, nerd. Let's go.

07:59.660 --> 08:02.019
You know, the wolves
usually eat outside.

08:02.020 --> 08:04.790
I'd rather hang with you.

08:07.300 --> 08:09.110
I didn't see you at the assembly.

08:10.960 --> 08:13.450
Kind of still figuring
my way around this place.

08:14.830 --> 08:18.329
Why didn't you ditch like
Landon and go play detective?

08:18.330 --> 08:21.929
Well, I'm actually working
on offensive spells for class.

08:21.930 --> 08:24.009
They only teach defensive magic here,

08:24.010 --> 08:26.879
but I personally think that
the curriculum needs to evolve.

08:26.880 --> 08:28.269
What?

08:28.270 --> 08:29.690
Oh, nothing.

08:29.700 --> 08:30.800
What?

08:30.810 --> 08:32.429
I'm still trying to wrap my head around

08:32.429 --> 08:34.698
this being a normal conversation here.

08:34.700 --> 08:37.109
Got it. So...

08:37.110 --> 08:39.740
Meaning you're happy to be back?

08:42.280 --> 08:44.949
I'll be happy when I
know that Landon can stay.

08:44.950 --> 08:46.970
And then, what if he can't?

08:46.980 --> 08:50.039
Bounce, witch. Rafael and I
need to have a little chat.

08:50.040 --> 08:51.860
Soon as Josie and I are done.

08:51.870 --> 08:53.989
Actually, newb, I'm your alpha.

08:53.990 --> 08:55.800
You're done when I say you're done.

09:06.730 --> 09:09.519
Well, would you look at the time.

09:09.520 --> 09:14.739
As fun as this hurricane
of toxic masculinity is,

09:14.740 --> 09:16.739
I have to get to class.

09:16.740 --> 09:18.180
I'll walk you.

09:29.740 --> 09:33.729
This is the senior hallway,

09:33.730 --> 09:35.619
where I spent much of my formative years

09:35.620 --> 09:38.449
stuffed in every
locker... except this one.

09:38.450 --> 09:41.470
That one doesn't open. On your
left, you'll find the bathroom.

09:41.480 --> 09:43.660
It's where I had my
first kiss with a toilet.

09:43.700 --> 09:46.780
I'm sorry. Is the fact that
I'm not openly hostile to you

09:46.820 --> 09:48.710
make it seem like we're
back to being friends?

09:50.710 --> 09:56.120
Uh, sorry. Just, I was going
for effortlessly natural.

09:56.160 --> 09:58.019
But this is all just
making me really nervous.

09:58.020 --> 10:00.329
Like, the school and seeing
Connor and being with you...

10:00.330 --> 10:03.589
Shouldn't you be talking
to anyone you know?

10:03.590 --> 10:05.150
That's easier said than done.

10:05.160 --> 10:07.280
There is no way Dana's
clique is talking to me

10:07.360 --> 10:09.620
unless you have a spell that
will make me retroactively cool.

10:09.630 --> 10:11.039
Well, I'll talk to them, then.

10:11.040 --> 10:13.159
It's even worse for you. Trust me.

10:13.160 --> 10:15.339
You have no idea how
human high schools work.

10:15.340 --> 10:17.099
You're the new girl. Might as well

10:17.100 --> 10:18.679
- be radioactive.
- I'm sorry.

10:18.680 --> 10:21.489
You look traumatized. Is
this loser bothering you?

10:21.490 --> 10:24.239
He keeps trying to get
me to buy his mix tape.

10:24.240 --> 10:25.509
Gross.

10:25.510 --> 10:27.809
Well, we're going to lunch. You hungry?

10:27.810 --> 10:29.740
Famished.

10:34.740 --> 10:36.950
Jogger called it in.

10:39.400 --> 10:41.179
Yeah, the plates match.

10:41.180 --> 10:43.100
It's Dana's car.

10:49.170 --> 10:51.720
Think it's safe to say
she's not a runaway.

11:01.250 --> 11:03.229
You said the creatures
were after a knife

11:03.230 --> 11:05.349
- that you had sent far away.
- They are.

11:05.350 --> 11:06.659
And I did.

11:06.660 --> 11:08.880
This doesn't make any sense.

11:11.370 --> 11:13.500
Ah, damn it.

11:18.760 --> 11:21.080
Actually, it's starting
to make perfect sense.

11:21.090 --> 11:22.599
What is it?

11:22.600 --> 11:24.340
A vampire bite.

11:33.430 --> 11:36.040
Nice form. You're one
of Dana's friends, right?

11:36.090 --> 11:39.730
Jill, and my friendship
with Dana doesn't define me.

11:41.540 --> 11:42.829
That was a joke.

11:42.830 --> 11:44.379
Of course it does.

11:44.380 --> 11:47.440
Cool, cool.

11:49.300 --> 11:52.229
Tell me where Dana and Sasha are
and we'll get out of your hair.

11:52.230 --> 11:53.670
More like split ends.

11:53.680 --> 11:56.880
Shut up, Saltzman. And why are
you all up in their business?

11:56.890 --> 11:59.920
Are all of you private
school kids this creepy?

12:01.240 --> 12:03.450
Uh.

12:03.460 --> 12:05.790
Okay, that's it. Hit the showers.

12:10.070 --> 12:11.909
Compulsion fail.

12:11.910 --> 12:15.129
Hope's probably doing
a victory lap by now.

12:15.130 --> 12:17.049
What's with the performance anxiety?

12:17.050 --> 12:19.299
I think you're distracting me.

12:19.300 --> 12:22.579
I'm wearing polyester.

12:22.580 --> 12:25.419
And you're totally pulling it off.

12:25.420 --> 12:28.639
Get your head in the game, MG.

12:31.050 --> 12:33.309
You have the school phone?

12:33.310 --> 12:35.389
Where were you keeping it?

12:35.390 --> 12:38.269
It's your dad. He trusts me.

12:38.270 --> 12:39.909
You smell like gummy bears.

12:39.910 --> 12:41.700
Answer it.

12:41.710 --> 12:42.840
Okay.

12:42.860 --> 12:43.869
Hello?

12:43.870 --> 12:46.899
I need to talk to everyone.

12:46.900 --> 12:49.270
- We split up.
- Lizzie.

12:49.280 --> 12:50.720
I told you to work together.

12:50.730 --> 12:53.380
In order to conquer, we
had to divide, Daddy.

12:53.390 --> 12:56.619
So looks like you're gonna have to
trust your own gene pool for once.

12:56.620 --> 12:58.089
Sorry to disappoint.

12:58.090 --> 13:00.949
Look, I'm about to
tell you three things,

13:00.950 --> 13:03.520
all equally horrifying, so
I need you to keep your cool.

13:03.530 --> 13:05.009
Can you both do that?

13:05.010 --> 13:07.199
Of course, no problem.

13:07.200 --> 13:10.280
Okay. One: Dana is dead.

13:11.620 --> 13:13.509
Two: A vampire killed her.

13:13.510 --> 13:15.219
Three: I just told the sheriff

13:15.220 --> 13:16.289
that we had nothing to do with it

13:16.290 --> 13:18.319
so I need to know right
now that I am right.

13:18.320 --> 13:19.739
Have either of you heard anything

13:19.740 --> 13:21.460
about the vampires
at our school feeding?

13:22.320 --> 13:24.289
- No.
- Nah.

13:24.290 --> 13:26.629
We're not supposed to,
everyone knows that.

13:26.630 --> 13:27.769
Okay. Good.

13:27.770 --> 13:29.230
I'll call you back when I know more.

13:29.240 --> 13:31.439
And I expect you to
be with Hope when I do.

13:34.650 --> 13:38.329
You are a horrible liar.

13:38.330 --> 13:39.880
Spill.

13:43.470 --> 13:45.819
Hey.

13:45.820 --> 13:47.410
Let me guess.

13:47.420 --> 13:48.919
Pigtails spilled her guts and confessed

13:48.920 --> 13:51.219
to kidnapping Dana
and Sasha. Case closed.

13:51.220 --> 13:52.389
Her name's Cheryl,

13:52.390 --> 13:53.950
and not exactly.

13:53.960 --> 13:57.199
But she did invite me to try
out for the cheerleading team.

13:57.200 --> 13:58.739
Who are you right now?

13:58.740 --> 14:00.369
And what is that thing on your head?

14:00.370 --> 14:02.629
It's a gift... from Cheryl.

14:02.630 --> 14:04.559
You're better than this, Hope.

14:04.560 --> 14:06.389
Relax, Eeyore.

14:06.390 --> 14:07.959
Dana gave it to her.

14:07.960 --> 14:09.879
It's potential locator spell material.

14:09.880 --> 14:12.199
Plus, even though Sasha
and Connor are dating,

14:12.200 --> 14:14.629
- Dana was sleeping with him behind her back.
- Yeah, some clue.

14:14.630 --> 14:16.189
Everyone at this school
knows Connor's a dick.

14:16.190 --> 14:17.359
Come on, Landon.

14:17.360 --> 14:19.249
Adultery, missing girls...

14:19.250 --> 14:21.369
It's like every TV show
that old people watch.

14:21.370 --> 14:23.539
A "crime of passion,"
I think they call it.

14:23.540 --> 14:25.009
I know Connor.

14:25.010 --> 14:26.589
He's made my life a living hell,

14:26.590 --> 14:28.170
but he's not a killer. Trust me.

14:28.180 --> 14:30.929
Trusting you is what got us into
this mess in the first place.

14:30.930 --> 14:32.850
Look. There he is.

14:36.580 --> 14:38.499
So do you want to play
good cop or bad cop?

14:38.500 --> 14:40.670
Because I don't think
"emo cop" is a thing.

14:40.680 --> 14:41.690
Oh, very funny.

14:41.700 --> 14:42.700
But while you were off making friends

14:42.710 --> 14:45.109
I did some sleuthing of my own.

14:45.110 --> 14:46.600
Scarf in Virginia heat?

14:47.660 --> 14:49.850
Sounds like a lead,
I think they call it.

14:52.470 --> 14:53.979
They're vampire bites, Ric.

14:53.980 --> 14:56.879
If they said they didn't do it,
they didn't do it. End of story.

14:56.880 --> 14:58.709
No, actually, it's just the
beginning, because now I have

14:58.710 --> 15:00.630
to put a 17-year-old
girl in this body bag,

15:00.640 --> 15:02.639
then lie to her parents about
what actually killed her.

15:02.640 --> 15:03.790
Or maybe you forgot what it's like

15:03.800 --> 15:04.829
to be on this side of that conversation.

15:04.830 --> 15:05.969
It's not about sides.

15:05.970 --> 15:07.590
Oh, yeah? Tell that to Dana.

15:14.050 --> 15:16.980
I thought you said we
were gonna have lunch.

15:16.990 --> 15:19.569
Yeah. Well, uh, one of us is.

15:21.520 --> 15:23.149
Don't be afraid.

15:25.850 --> 15:26.990
Let her go.

15:30.480 --> 15:32.109
Date's over.

15:32.110 --> 15:33.799
It's not me, it's you.

15:33.800 --> 15:36.610
Now forget this ever happened
and get back to class.

15:39.300 --> 15:40.420
Great.

15:40.430 --> 15:41.689
Hope's already here.

15:41.690 --> 15:43.050
Thought we were cool, bruh.

15:43.060 --> 15:44.450
Don't "bruh" him.

15:44.460 --> 15:47.339
Second place or not,
we know you killed Dana.

15:47.340 --> 15:48.929
Wait. Dana's dead?

15:48.930 --> 15:51.749
Dr. Saltzman said they found
her dead from a vampire bite.

15:51.750 --> 15:54.930
I didn't kill her, so y'all need
to get the hell outta my face.

15:58.090 --> 16:01.279
Come on, guys, let's go.

16:01.280 --> 16:02.519
It's hero time.

16:02.520 --> 16:05.139
To the Blondemobile.

16:07.810 --> 16:10.179
Not so fast, Kaleb.

16:12.790 --> 16:15.619
I told you, all I did was feed.

16:15.620 --> 16:17.609
Torture me all you want to,

16:17.610 --> 16:19.290
but my answer's gonna remain the same...

16:20.140 --> 16:22.339
because I didn't kill Dana.

16:22.340 --> 16:24.379
Uh, he's right.

16:24.380 --> 16:27.469
What, so you're a mind
reader now, Landon?

16:27.470 --> 16:29.050
Call it a hunch.

16:38.180 --> 16:41.189
We were on the way to graffiti
that mill at your school.

16:41.190 --> 16:42.909
It was a harmless prank.

16:42.910 --> 16:45.069
But then I got snatched.

16:45.070 --> 16:47.849
Next thing I remember,
I woke up in a ditch.

16:47.850 --> 16:50.479
So enjoy it while you can, Lizzie.

16:50.480 --> 16:51.899
I'm sure I look like crap.

16:51.900 --> 16:53.980
Oh, my God.

16:54.030 --> 16:55.209
What is that?

16:55.210 --> 16:56.440
It's...

16:57.230 --> 16:58.699
Someone help me out here.

16:58.700 --> 17:00.139
It's the mother of all hickeys.

17:00.140 --> 17:01.219
You're fine, Dana.

17:01.220 --> 17:03.429
You're just a-a little slutty.

17:03.430 --> 17:06.719
I don't even like any of you.

17:06.720 --> 17:08.319
I should be talking to the cops.

17:08.329 --> 17:11.099
- I can't let you do that.
- Ad somnum.

17:11.109 --> 17:13.669
I mean, she can't let you do that.

17:13.670 --> 17:17.459
So you didn't kill her.
You freaking turned her?

17:17.460 --> 17:18.949
Turned her?

17:18.950 --> 17:21.449
You think I want to sit and
listen to that for all eternity?

17:21.450 --> 17:23.409
Well, someone did, meaning that we have

17:23.410 --> 17:25.789
a transitioning vampire on our hands.

17:25.790 --> 17:28.339
So what are we gonna do with her?

17:33.550 --> 17:35.959
Foster kid. I've been looking for you.

17:35.960 --> 17:37.369
I'll catch up with you later.

17:37.370 --> 17:39.010
I got to get to class.

17:40.750 --> 17:44.209
Look, uh, Jed, right?

17:44.210 --> 17:46.799
I don't want any problems.

17:46.800 --> 17:47.909
Neither do we.

17:47.910 --> 17:50.049
We just want to initiate
you into the pack.

17:50.050 --> 17:51.899
Okay. The process is simple.

17:51.900 --> 17:53.710
You triggered your
werewolf curse this month,

17:53.720 --> 17:55.429
which means you killed
somebody recently.

17:55.430 --> 17:56.819
Maybe on purpose,

17:56.820 --> 17:58.749
maybe not.

17:58.750 --> 18:01.059
All you gotta do is tell us the story.

18:01.060 --> 18:02.919
That's our rite of passage.

18:02.920 --> 18:05.159
Yeah, I'm not really a pack kinda guy.

18:05.160 --> 18:06.569
You still don't get it, do you?

18:06.570 --> 18:08.999
You don't have a choice.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.670
You can either submit or you
can bleed and then submit.

18:14.220 --> 18:15.970
It's your call.

18:43.310 --> 18:44.870
Hey.

18:47.940 --> 18:49.899
I said, hey!

19:02.270 --> 19:04.520
To be continued.

19:07.960 --> 19:10.500
- Hey, are you okay?
- Get off of me!

19:14.250 --> 19:16.360
Just stay away from me.

19:29.850 --> 19:32.790
So let me get this straight.

19:32.800 --> 19:35.669
Dana died with vampire
blood in her system

19:35.670 --> 19:37.869
so she came back to life

19:37.870 --> 19:39.570
and now she's in transition,

19:39.580 --> 19:42.530
and she needs to feed or die?

19:42.540 --> 19:44.390
Nailed it, bro. Easy decision, right?

19:47.170 --> 19:49.099
- Huh.
- All right, so...

19:49.100 --> 19:50.910
we give her human
blood, it's that simple.

19:50.920 --> 19:53.439
Not everyone wants to be supernatural.

19:53.440 --> 19:55.349
Some people just want to be normal.

19:55.350 --> 19:58.849
Dana's traumatized, you
guys. This is a huge decision.

19:58.850 --> 20:00.970
Maybe we should give her a day or two.

20:00.980 --> 20:03.300
She'll be dead in a
day if she doesn't feed.

20:04.730 --> 20:06.209
Oops.

20:06.210 --> 20:08.229
I suck at math.

20:08.230 --> 20:10.010
You should tell her the truth.

20:10.020 --> 20:11.939
My guess is that she'd be psyched to be

20:11.940 --> 20:15.039
at a place like your
school... I know I would.

20:15.040 --> 20:16.919
You're awful quiet over there, MG.

20:16.920 --> 20:18.819
I'm a feminist, bruh.
I'm not gonna tell Dana

20:18.820 --> 20:20.079
what to do with her body.

20:20.080 --> 20:21.220
Landon's right.

20:26.890 --> 20:29.379
Ugh, fine.

20:29.380 --> 20:33.440
Okay, but to be clear, she
is not joining drill team.

20:34.350 --> 20:35.570
Surgere.

20:40.190 --> 20:42.360
Did I pass out?

20:43.270 --> 20:44.639
I don't feel so well.

20:44.640 --> 20:46.339
We know how you feel.

20:46.340 --> 20:48.260
And it's okay, you're just hungry.

20:48.270 --> 20:50.059
Anorexia was sophomore year.

20:50.060 --> 20:51.989
This is something else.

20:51.990 --> 20:53.859
You'll feel better after
you feed. I promise.

20:53.860 --> 20:56.409
Oh, shut up. For real.

20:56.410 --> 20:59.360
Even thinking about
eating makes me want to...

21:03.440 --> 21:04.890
Oh, damn. What'd that girl eat?

21:06.770 --> 21:10.509
I think her soul just
got on my shoes. Ew.

21:10.510 --> 21:12.069
I think I'm-a be sick, too.

21:12.070 --> 21:13.209
Is this normal?

21:13.210 --> 21:14.810
She's puking her guts out.

21:14.820 --> 21:15.820
Literally.

21:16.480 --> 21:18.550
Dana. Dana!

21:25.420 --> 21:27.809
Should we call your dad?

21:27.810 --> 21:30.510
Why? So he can take
another bullet for you?

21:30.520 --> 21:31.939
No.

21:31.940 --> 21:34.649
Because whatever did
this is not a vampire.

21:34.650 --> 21:37.470
It's got to be another
monster from the knife.

21:44.990 --> 21:49.459
Well, maybe the monster's been
right in front of us all along.

21:49.460 --> 21:51.219
What...?

21:51.220 --> 21:52.530
Are you serious?

21:52.540 --> 21:54.379
Hey, none of this started
happening until you showed up

21:54.380 --> 21:56.600
and stole that knife, which is exactly

21:56.620 --> 21:58.679
what the other monsters came here to do.

21:58.680 --> 22:00.739
- You saying it's a coincidence?
- Yeah.

22:00.740 --> 22:02.330
Yeah. Yes, I am.

22:06.950 --> 22:08.720
You believe me, right?

22:13.490 --> 22:15.420
Got it.

22:16.360 --> 22:18.340
Say no more.

22:26.690 --> 22:29.560
- Raf. Raf.
- I told you to leave me alone!

22:29.570 --> 22:32.039
No, I can't do that until you...
No, just calm down!

22:32.040 --> 22:34.269
- It's not safe! Get away!
- Calm down.

22:34.270 --> 22:36.499
Close your eyes and breathe.

22:36.500 --> 22:38.079
Breathe.

22:38.080 --> 22:39.769
Just like me.

22:44.720 --> 22:47.389
Good.

22:47.390 --> 22:50.039
Breathe.

22:53.690 --> 22:55.689
Good.

22:55.690 --> 22:58.250
That's more like it.

23:07.550 --> 23:10.579
Was that magic?

23:10.580 --> 23:13.179
No. Just...

23:13.180 --> 23:16.249
years of practice with Lizzie, I guess.

23:16.250 --> 23:19.139
- I didn't mean to scare you.
- No.

23:19.140 --> 23:21.719
You can't scare me. Hey.

23:21.720 --> 23:23.399
Hey.

23:23.400 --> 23:26.549
What scares me is that you're
dead if you don't submit.

23:26.550 --> 23:28.450
Hey, no,

23:28.460 --> 23:29.959
it's just the way it is.

23:29.960 --> 23:32.009
You're the one talking
about making change, right?

23:32.010 --> 23:35.909
I meant adding an elective,
not launching a revolution.

23:35.910 --> 23:38.399
- Josie...
- Jed's an alpha, okay?

23:38.400 --> 23:40.439
You're a wolf. Okay? That's just

23:40.440 --> 23:42.749
- the way it is. There's no other way.
- Josie.

24:12.030 --> 24:13.280
Josie?

24:26.510 --> 24:28.520
It's Sasha.

24:37.330 --> 24:38.749
- Uh...
- Are you okay?

24:38.750 --> 24:40.310
No, Raf, I think I'm stuck.

24:46.060 --> 24:47.889
Raf.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.639
What?

25:25.640 --> 25:27.549
All right, come on.
Let's get this over with.

25:27.550 --> 25:29.359
What's it gonna be? Toilet bowl?

25:29.360 --> 25:30.559
Trash can?

25:30.560 --> 25:32.000
Bloody nose?

25:34.740 --> 25:36.450
Say something, you dick.

25:40.750 --> 25:43.309
No, you made my life miserable.

25:43.310 --> 25:45.420
You don't get to pretend I don't exist.

26:14.960 --> 26:17.960
Nasty. Yeah, so, um, I'm out of here.

26:17.970 --> 26:19.529
But little piece of advice...

26:19.530 --> 26:23.079
Landon could be in there
right now eating fools.

26:23.080 --> 26:26.500
So, I'll holla.

26:28.570 --> 26:31.259
Come on, guys.

26:31.260 --> 26:33.450
If it's not Landon, then
what else could it be?

26:36.830 --> 26:38.220
Spider.

26:39.040 --> 26:42.070
A big spider. An Arachne,
if you want to get specific.

26:45.750 --> 26:48.349
This is nerd porn, not real life.

26:48.350 --> 26:49.900
So were dragons and gargoyles.

26:49.910 --> 26:53.089
The writer bases her
comics off of Greek lore.

26:53.090 --> 26:54.779
An Arachne was originally

26:54.780 --> 26:57.050
a beautiful woman who was
cursed by a jealous god

26:57.060 --> 26:58.889
and turned into a giant spider.

26:58.890 --> 27:01.809
Uh, all it wants is to
be human, so it wears

27:01.810 --> 27:03.759
the skin of its prey to pass.

27:03.760 --> 27:06.300
Oh, my God. Its-its fangs are huge,

27:06.310 --> 27:08.489
so they could pass for a vampire bite.

27:08.490 --> 27:11.219
And its bite liquefies its victims!

27:11.220 --> 27:13.749
Plus, I found a web in Dana's hair.

27:13.750 --> 27:14.959
That would explain why it couldn't

27:14.960 --> 27:16.409
follow the knife out of town.

27:16.410 --> 27:18.750
An SUV-sized insect
can't exactly hitchhike

27:18.760 --> 27:20.409
unless it inhabits the body of someone.

27:20.410 --> 27:23.979
- Who? Sasha maybe?
- My money is still on your boyfriend.

27:23.980 --> 27:26.750
- He's not my boyfriend.
- If we had something from it,

27:26.780 --> 27:28.149
we could do a tracking spell.

27:28.150 --> 27:31.060
Would its face work?

27:39.670 --> 27:42.879
This is bad. Whatever spun this,

27:42.880 --> 27:44.579
it's gonna come back
and it's gonna eat us.

27:44.580 --> 27:46.139
Can't you witch us out of here?

27:46.140 --> 27:48.469
No, that's not how my powers work.

27:48.470 --> 27:51.479
My sister and I, we come from
this specific witch bloodline

27:51.480 --> 27:52.819
called the Gemini Coven.

27:52.820 --> 27:54.530
Basically, we don't
have powers of our own.

27:54.540 --> 27:57.199
We have to siphon them
from other things first.

27:57.200 --> 27:59.189
So, that thing that you did earlier,

27:59.190 --> 28:00.909
you siphoned power from a wall?

28:00.910 --> 28:02.739
There's magic that
runs through the school.

28:02.740 --> 28:04.139
It works on small spells.

28:04.140 --> 28:06.209
Okay, can you siphon a wolf?

28:06.210 --> 28:08.139
I mean, theoretically, yeah,

28:08.140 --> 28:09.879
but my hands are stuck.

28:09.880 --> 28:12.220
Unless...

28:24.770 --> 28:26.439
That was unexpected.

28:26.440 --> 28:27.959
Sorry.

28:27.960 --> 28:29.360
Don't be.

28:30.310 --> 28:32.159
Uh, did it work?

28:32.160 --> 28:34.239
I don't know. The room's still spinning.

28:35.520 --> 28:37.429
Hey!

28:37.430 --> 28:38.830
Hey, we're trapped up here!

28:38.840 --> 28:41.290
Connor?

28:44.680 --> 28:46.110
Damn.

28:49.910 --> 28:51.790
Whoa.

28:53.820 --> 28:54.949
He's coming.

28:56.560 --> 28:57.690
Josie,

28:57.700 --> 28:59.409
now would be a good
time for one of those

28:59.410 --> 29:01.370
offensive magic spells
you were talking about.

29:03.290 --> 29:04.660
Ignarious.

29:09.980 --> 29:12.400
All right, I think you got him.

29:16.520 --> 29:18.280
Or we just pissed him off.

29:22.230 --> 29:24.139
It's for you.

29:24.140 --> 29:26.389
No way I'm telling your
dad what we're about to do.

29:26.390 --> 29:27.829
I suck at lying.

29:27.830 --> 29:29.149
You're great at it.

29:29.150 --> 29:31.489
You're his favorite.

29:31.490 --> 29:33.819
You're the hero.

29:33.820 --> 29:35.529
Hi, Daddy!

29:35.530 --> 29:36.760
Hey, thought I'd call,

29:36.770 --> 29:39.079
check in, see how things are going.

29:39.080 --> 29:40.589
So good.

29:40.590 --> 29:42.950
Really? Define "good," Lizzie,

29:42.960 --> 29:45.169
because I don't think that
involves me tracking down

29:45.170 --> 29:47.069
Dana's body to the glove compartment.

29:47.070 --> 29:49.110
Listen, Dad, it's fine.
We cracked the case.

29:49.120 --> 29:50.140
It's a spider.

29:50.150 --> 29:52.179
But, like, a big, huge,

29:52.180 --> 29:53.349
nasty spider.

29:53.350 --> 29:55.379
And MG's comic books
know how to kill it.

29:55.380 --> 29:58.639
Comic books? Really?
Lizzie, listen to me,

29:58.640 --> 30:01.679
whatever you're thinking
of doing, don't, okay?

30:01.680 --> 30:03.519
So just tell me where you are,

30:03.520 --> 30:05.059
and Matt and I will be right there.

30:05.060 --> 30:06.260
And where is Hope?

30:06.270 --> 30:07.569
I'm sorry, Dad.

30:07.570 --> 30:09.620
You're gonna have to trust me for once.

30:13.280 --> 30:14.990
Let's do this.

30:16.660 --> 30:18.340
I think he's still out there.

30:32.900 --> 30:34.610
Hey! Douchebag!

30:35.790 --> 30:37.360
Oh.

30:38.950 --> 30:40.379
I hate spiders.

30:40.380 --> 30:42.780
- You need to get us out of here.
- Crap.

30:45.740 --> 30:47.080
Uanascar.

30:49.660 --> 30:54.640
Lizzie, I need your help!
Josie. Take my hand.

30:57.920 --> 30:59.299
Repeat after me.

30:59.300 --> 31:01.429
Imperium fluctus malleus.

31:03.120 --> 31:05.200
Imperium fluctus malleus.

31:05.380 --> 31:07.510
Imperium fluctus malleus.

31:08.310 --> 31:10.510
Imperium fluctus malleus.

31:10.540 --> 31:12.959
Imperium fluctus malleus.

31:12.960 --> 31:15.049
Imperium fluctus malleus!

32:15.770 --> 32:17.359
- Was she bitten?
- No.

32:17.360 --> 32:20.270
You're gonna be fine. There
was a party in the woods.

32:20.370 --> 32:22.100
You and Dana had the time of your lives.

32:22.120 --> 32:23.290
But on the way home,

32:23.300 --> 32:25.339
you guys were attacked
by a mountain lion.

32:25.340 --> 32:27.199
You survived and Dana didn't.

32:27.200 --> 32:29.189
There was nothing you could do.

32:29.190 --> 32:30.909
Dana's dead?

32:30.910 --> 32:32.519
Just take it all away.

32:32.520 --> 32:34.240
Tell her not to feel anything.

32:34.250 --> 32:36.609
You can't compel her not to grieve.

32:36.610 --> 32:38.019
I'm helping her.

32:38.020 --> 32:40.519
Tell her that it's gonna hurt.

32:40.520 --> 32:46.909
It always will. Tell her that some
days will be harder than others...

32:46.910 --> 32:49.069
but eventually she'll
remember the good times

32:49.070 --> 32:52.739
she had with Dana, too.

32:52.740 --> 32:54.260
Tell her to hold on to those,

32:54.320 --> 32:56.800
because it's the key
to getting through this.

33:14.510 --> 33:16.519
Are you sure that you want to do this?

33:16.520 --> 33:18.619
You saw what they did to me.

33:18.620 --> 33:21.199
I don't think going lone
wolf's an option anymore.

33:21.200 --> 33:23.050
- Do you?
- Don't look at me.

33:23.060 --> 33:25.660
I'm a twin. I don't do anything solo.

33:27.600 --> 33:30.969
Look, after Cassie died,

33:30.970 --> 33:33.539
I thought Landon was the
only pack that I'd ever have.

33:33.540 --> 33:37.239
I didn't think that
I needed anyone else.

33:37.240 --> 33:39.719
Be honest with me.

33:39.720 --> 33:42.199
Is this school, these people...

33:42.200 --> 33:45.100
keeping Landon here... Is it worth it?

33:46.890 --> 33:48.889
This place is flawed.

33:48.890 --> 33:51.379
Every single person here
is cursed in some way,

33:51.380 --> 33:53.529
whether it's blood or just life.

33:53.530 --> 33:56.340
Everyone has issues of their
own that they're dealing with.

33:57.680 --> 33:59.359
But we're all in this together.

33:59.360 --> 34:01.889
Every single person here,
we look out for each other.

34:01.890 --> 34:03.929
So, yeah.

34:03.930 --> 34:05.740
It's worth it.

34:12.070 --> 34:13.580
Little help?

34:18.260 --> 34:20.259
Medicine ball.

34:20.260 --> 34:21.699
Jed and his boys

34:21.699 --> 34:23.010
play for keeps.

34:26.670 --> 34:28.509
Foster kid.

34:28.510 --> 34:30.070
You back for more?

34:33.440 --> 34:35.280
I killed my girlfriend.

34:36.639 --> 34:39.299
It was an accident.

34:39.300 --> 34:42.609
I was behind the wheel,
and I lost control.

34:42.610 --> 34:45.210
When I woke up, I was in the hospital.

34:47.420 --> 34:49.248
Landon had to tell me that she was dead,

34:49.250 --> 34:50.870
and I don't know anything else.

34:52.630 --> 34:54.330
Am I a part of the pack now?

34:56.130 --> 34:58.090
Take a knee.

34:59.720 --> 35:01.209
What?

35:01.210 --> 35:02.990
You're gonna submit to your alpha,

35:03.000 --> 35:05.060
you take a knee.

35:08.970 --> 35:10.499
No, I'm just playing.

35:10.500 --> 35:12.809
It's your ball.

35:12.810 --> 35:14.949
- Do this, Rafael.
- You're in the next round.

35:39.700 --> 35:41.740
So much for my plan to spend the day

35:41.780 --> 35:44.020
as a normal teenage girl.

35:46.840 --> 35:48.999
Did good back there.

35:49.000 --> 35:50.759
Yeah.

35:50.760 --> 35:54.920
Felt nice to be part of the team...

35:54.930 --> 35:57.999
until you all accused
me of being a monster.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.690
I'm sorry.

36:02.840 --> 36:05.769
It's just gonna take us some time

36:05.770 --> 36:07.860
- before we can trust you again.
- Yeah.

36:07.890 --> 36:10.179
I got that. Repeatedly.

36:10.180 --> 36:12.320
So let me lay this out
for you all at once.

36:12.370 --> 36:14.369
I don't know why I
was drawn to that knife

36:14.370 --> 36:15.499
any more than I can explain

36:15.500 --> 36:17.410
why a supersized spider
inhabited the body

36:17.420 --> 36:19.359
of a kid who used to
bully me in high school.

36:19.360 --> 36:20.419
I don't know

36:20.420 --> 36:22.299
why creatures we've
only read about in books

36:22.300 --> 36:24.639
are making cameos in Mystic Falls.

36:24.640 --> 36:27.739
I don't have an
explanation for any of this.

36:27.740 --> 36:29.919
And let's be honest,
neither do any of you.

36:29.920 --> 36:33.869
So as far as I can see, we're
supposed to be in this together.

36:33.870 --> 36:36.469
And this morning, all I wanted to be

36:36.470 --> 36:40.539
was sitting here. Part of all of this.

36:40.540 --> 36:42.549
Spending time with you.

36:42.550 --> 36:46.569
But all day long you ridiculed me,

36:46.570 --> 36:49.240
and then you hung me out to dry.

36:51.650 --> 36:53.540
When it mattered.

37:01.650 --> 37:04.909
You wanted to know what
it's like to be normal?

37:04.910 --> 37:07.069
Congrats, Hope.

37:07.070 --> 37:10.130
You're officially normal.

37:20.500 --> 37:22.900
I specifically asked you to wait.

37:22.920 --> 37:24.279
- I know, but...
- No buts.

37:24.280 --> 37:25.629
There are no buts, Lizzie.

37:25.630 --> 37:26.980
Okay, being a hero

37:27.000 --> 37:29.259
is not more important than being safe.

37:29.260 --> 37:30.689
I'm not a hero, Dad.

37:30.690 --> 37:31.699
The only reason

37:31.700 --> 37:33.590
I was trying to be is because that's how

37:33.600 --> 37:35.479
you're always treating Hope.

37:35.480 --> 37:37.959
Let's be honest.

37:37.960 --> 37:40.649
She's better at it than I'll ever be.

37:40.650 --> 37:42.459
Hope is not the goal.

37:42.460 --> 37:44.539
Hope is a cautionary tale.

37:44.540 --> 37:45.919
And the reasons I trust her

37:45.920 --> 37:47.190
are the last things I'd ever want

37:47.200 --> 37:48.949
the two of you to experience.

37:48.950 --> 37:50.470
That's why I founded this school.

37:50.480 --> 37:52.879
That's why there are rules.

37:52.880 --> 37:54.176
Well, the only reason
why we're alive today

37:54.200 --> 37:55.749
is because we broke the rules.

37:55.750 --> 37:57.880
Today Hope did a spell that saved us,

37:57.900 --> 37:59.329
a spell that we would have known

37:59.330 --> 38:01.239
if the school taught us offensive magic.

38:01.240 --> 38:02.890
And then Lizzie almost died yesterday

38:02.900 --> 38:03.980
because you didn't tell us

38:03.990 --> 38:05.969
to be on the lookout for monsters.

38:05.970 --> 38:07.620
The past couple of days have proven

38:07.640 --> 38:09.750
that you cannot protect
us from everything.

38:11.260 --> 38:13.700
We have to start learning
how to protect ourselves.

38:16.520 --> 38:19.309
Oh, God.

38:19.310 --> 38:21.519
Is this that moment they talk about

38:21.520 --> 38:23.409
when parents lose all control?

38:23.410 --> 38:24.529
- Dad.
- Dad.

38:24.530 --> 38:25.589
All right,

38:25.590 --> 38:27.859
I will take it under consideration.

38:27.860 --> 38:29.199
Okay?

38:29.200 --> 38:32.420
Now... go to bed.

38:37.750 --> 38:39.520
I love you.

38:40.580 --> 38:41.950
Sort of.

38:46.340 --> 38:48.900
Where did that come from?

38:51.010 --> 38:54.000
I guess I felt like
launching the revolution.

38:55.360 --> 38:56.469
You sold me out!

38:56.470 --> 38:58.429
Yeah, I know.

38:58.430 --> 38:59.890
Lizzie caught me lying,

38:59.920 --> 39:01.880
- and I-I just crumbled.
- What?

39:01.890 --> 39:03.700
Dude, you got to know
who you stand with.

39:03.710 --> 39:04.979
And it can't be with some girl

39:04.980 --> 39:06.999
who thinks she's too good
to give you the time of day.

39:07.000 --> 39:09.009
Vamps before tramps, remember?

39:09.010 --> 39:10.040
Yeah.

39:13.020 --> 39:14.880
N-No.

39:16.010 --> 39:17.449
Look, I appreciate the rhyme,

39:17.450 --> 39:19.539
but don't disrespect her like that.

39:19.540 --> 39:22.039
We got enough monsters
out here as it is.

39:22.040 --> 39:23.889
We cannot become one of them.

39:23.890 --> 39:26.189
You're a puppet, MG.

39:26.190 --> 39:27.350
The headmaster

39:27.360 --> 39:29.069
and his daughter's little puppet.

39:29.070 --> 39:30.879
- No, I'm not.
- No?

39:30.880 --> 39:32.240
Then it doesn't bother you

39:32.250 --> 39:34.409
that she bosses you around
and you just take it, right?

39:34.410 --> 39:36.149
I mean, he makes you
run all his errands,

39:36.150 --> 39:38.269
and you just take it.

39:38.270 --> 39:41.369
Even today. They couldn't even
let the vamps out on our own.

39:41.370 --> 39:44.079
They had to send the
witches to keep an eye on us.

39:44.080 --> 39:46.419
Hell, they even make rules
about how we're supposed to eat,

39:46.420 --> 39:48.439
but they don't tell us what
they're actually feeding us.

39:48.440 --> 39:51.059
There's blood bags in that
refrigerator right there.

39:51.060 --> 39:52.479
But not human blood!

39:52.480 --> 39:54.029
What are you talking about?

39:56.590 --> 39:58.159
You know what, man?

39:58.160 --> 40:00.489
Ask yourself why you
don't see many rabbits

40:00.490 --> 40:02.220
running around the yard around here.

40:13.250 --> 40:16.709
Evening, Officer. Let me guess,
you're here to give me a medal.

40:16.710 --> 40:18.539
Actually, I'm here to ask
you a few questions.

40:18.540 --> 40:19.839
- About what?
- About why half

40:19.840 --> 40:21.429
the Mystic Falls cheerleading squad's

40:21.430 --> 40:23.009
wearing scarves around their necks.

40:23.010 --> 40:24.649
Walk away, Matt.

40:24.650 --> 40:25.899
I'll handle this.

40:25.900 --> 40:27.550
Oh, don't pretend like you on my side

40:27.560 --> 40:28.979
when you the one who told him.

40:28.980 --> 40:30.699
Question is: who told you?

40:30.700 --> 40:32.279
Lizzie? MG?

40:32.280 --> 40:33.539
Actually, you just did.

40:33.540 --> 40:34.670
I've had my suspicions,

40:34.680 --> 40:36.210
but I could never confirm them.

40:38.660 --> 40:42.599
So... what are you gonna do about it?

40:42.600 --> 40:44.560
'Cause I know you ain't locking me up.

40:50.800 --> 40:53.009
I've been doing this too long, Ric.

40:53.010 --> 40:55.649
If your kids are a threat,
I'll be coming for them.

40:55.650 --> 40:58.160
If you threaten my kids, Sheriff,

40:58.170 --> 41:00.580
I'll be the one coming for you.

41:12.000 --> 41:15.819
Yeah, well, I know why
it's quiet on your end.

41:15.820 --> 41:18.869
We had a visit from an ancient
body-snatching spider today.

41:18.870 --> 41:22.199
Wow, that's an...
interesting development.

41:25.830 --> 41:28.519
Hang on a sec.

41:28.520 --> 41:30.339
Listen, why don't you come home?

41:30.340 --> 41:32.019
We were wrong.

41:32.020 --> 41:33.810
Nothing's coming your way.

41:41.700 --> 41:44.780
Hold that thought.
