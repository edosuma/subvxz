WEBVTT

00:06.450 --> 00:09.410
'Rosa was being hurt,
but not by Simon.'

00:09.410 --> 00:11.410
Maybe Walden did something to Rosa
and they found out?

00:11.410 --> 00:13.410
That was sent
to an unregistered burner.

00:13.410 --> 00:16.410
There was a partial footprint,
about ten metres from the body.

00:16.410 --> 00:17.770
Size five, as yet unidentified.

00:17.770 --> 00:20.410
'I saw you getting into his car.

00:20.410 --> 00:22.410
'The bloke from the Woodyard.'

00:22.410 --> 00:26.410
I am sick and tired of you
treating me like a child!

00:26.410 --> 00:28.090
'I know what you saw this morning.'

00:28.930 --> 00:33.410
I just wish you'd given us a chance
to help you re-find the light.

00:33.410 --> 00:35.410
'She had this scrapbook.'

00:35.410 --> 00:37.410
It's OK to want your mum
to be proud of you.

00:37.410 --> 00:39.410
I thought I could meet him.

00:39.410 --> 00:43.410
'Jonathan,
I found this on my dad's computer.

00:43.410 --> 00:44.410
'A non-disclosure agreement.

00:44.410 --> 00:46.410
'He wanted Simon
to keep something quiet.'

00:46.410 --> 00:49.410
You don't know what my dad is like.
He killed my mum.

00:49.410 --> 00:51.410
If we find out
who gave Rosa that necklace,

00:51.410 --> 00:52.410
we might find out
who was hurting her.

00:52.410 --> 00:55.410
Maybe even Simon Walden's killer,
too. It's him.

01:38.250 --> 01:40.090
Are you all right?

01:45.930 --> 01:49.410
What time will she be here?
Four.

01:52.610 --> 01:54.610
Just don't you dare be late.

02:03.410 --> 02:05.610
Do you think
more girls are in danger?

02:07.250 --> 02:08.410
I don't know.

02:19.410 --> 02:20.410
Everything all right, Detective?

02:20.410 --> 02:23.410
We'd like to speak to you
at the station.

02:23.410 --> 02:25.410
I'll have to make some calls.
Rearrange my morning.

02:25.410 --> 02:27.410
No, Mr Reasley. Now.

03:05.410 --> 03:10.410
Rosa Shapland's mother
found this hidden in her bedroom.

03:10.410 --> 03:12.930
Can you tell us how and why

03:12.930 --> 03:16.410
you came to give a £120 necklace
to a volunteer?

03:17.610 --> 03:20.410
I bought it for my daughter
a few weeks ago.

03:20.410 --> 03:22.410
So why did you give it to Rosa?

03:22.410 --> 03:25.410
I felt sorry for her. She was upset.

03:25.410 --> 03:27.410
About what?

03:27.410 --> 03:30.410
She was in a tizz about something.
Maybe something a student had done.

03:30.410 --> 03:35.410
She's a lovely girl, but
the slightest thing can upset her.

03:35.410 --> 03:39.410
And her family, I think
they encourage her to feel...

03:39.410 --> 03:41.410
the world is a dangerous place.

03:43.410 --> 03:45.410
Did you tell anyone
you'd given it to her?

03:47.450 --> 03:51.410
I realised afterwards it was
an ill-advised thing to have done.

03:53.410 --> 03:56.410
Did you tell Rosa
to keep it a secret? No.

03:57.610 --> 04:01.410
We have reason to believe
that somebody was hurting Rosa.

04:01.410 --> 04:03.410
We think that same person

04:03.410 --> 04:06.610
later abducted her
and murdered Simon Walden.

04:08.410 --> 04:12.610
You told me that
you had had an argument with Simon

04:12.610 --> 04:14.410
shortly before he died.

04:17.410 --> 04:19.410
Was that about Rosa?

04:19.410 --> 04:21.610
No! No.

04:21.610 --> 04:23.410
Was it about the £200,000

04:23.410 --> 04:25.410
that Walden was planning
on donating to the Woodyard?

04:26.410 --> 04:29.410
What?
Money that's now missing.

04:30.770 --> 04:32.610
I don't know anything about that.

04:32.610 --> 04:34.410
'He's lying.'

04:34.410 --> 04:37.250
We need to search his property.
I reckon we'd find that burner.

04:37.250 --> 04:39.410
We haven't got enough evidence
for a warrant yet.

04:39.410 --> 04:41.410
Whoever sent those texts,
we know Walden thought

04:41.410 --> 04:43.410
they'd go to prison
for what they'd done.

04:43.410 --> 04:44.410
So what?

04:44.410 --> 04:47.410
Reasley was hurting Rosa
in some way and...

04:48.410 --> 04:50.410
..Walden caught him?

04:50.410 --> 04:52.610
But then why abduct Rosa
after Walden had died?

04:52.610 --> 04:56.250
She wasn't sexually assaulted.
To make sure she'd stay quiet?

04:56.250 --> 04:59.410
Sorry. I don't buy it.
I don't think it was him.

04:59.410 --> 05:01.770
Well, Jesus, Ross,
are you from the '70s?

05:03.410 --> 05:06.410
Look, Reasley has access to dozens
of vulnerable girls at the Woodyard.

05:06.410 --> 05:08.410
I mean, this thing could be bigger.

05:08.410 --> 05:10.250
There could be more girls
in danger now.

05:10.250 --> 05:11.610
But until we can show that...

05:13.410 --> 05:14.410
..we can't hold him.

05:16.410 --> 05:18.410
What about Walden's 200K?

05:18.410 --> 05:21.410
The court order hasn't come
through for the payment site yet.

05:21.410 --> 05:23.610
Then chase it. Today.
I want to know where that money is

05:23.610 --> 05:26.410
and why he was planning on giving it
away in the first place.

05:26.410 --> 05:29.410
Let's go.

05:32.410 --> 05:34.450
Hungover again, DS Rafferty?

05:37.450 --> 05:40.410
Look, I understand,
you feel threatened, Ross.

05:40.410 --> 05:42.410
Yeah, I understand
there's not many women like me

05:42.410 --> 05:45.090
in your little rugby twat, little
boys' club, little world, yeah?

05:45.090 --> 05:47.410
But I'm your senior officer.

05:47.410 --> 05:49.410
Show a bit of bloody respect.

06:04.770 --> 06:08.410
OK... I've got one with chocolate
and one without.

06:08.410 --> 06:11.410
Dad's been questioned by the police.

06:11.410 --> 06:13.410
About Rosa Shapland's disappearance.

06:19.410 --> 06:21.410
All right?

06:21.410 --> 06:24.410
Rosa's back home from hospital.

06:24.410 --> 06:28.410
She won't... say anything, will she?

06:34.410 --> 06:36.410
See you later, yeah?

06:55.410 --> 06:57.410
Rosa?

06:58.410 --> 07:00.410
Hi.
Hi.

07:00.410 --> 07:02.410
Is it OK
if we ask you some questions?

07:03.410 --> 07:05.410
Everything's all fuzzy.

07:05.410 --> 07:08.410
The doctor said your head injury
might cause some memory problems.

07:09.410 --> 07:11.410
Do you remember being in the chalet?

07:11.410 --> 07:13.410
It's all blurry.

07:14.410 --> 07:17.770
How did you get there?
Did... Did someone take you there?

07:17.770 --> 07:20.410
I remember leaving
the Woodyard at lunch.

07:20.410 --> 07:22.930
Everything after that is a blank.

07:22.930 --> 07:25.410
You made a 999 call.

07:25.410 --> 07:27.410
I... I don't remember that.

07:29.410 --> 07:34.410
When you made the 999 call,
you talked about "he".

07:34.410 --> 07:36.610
Who were you talking about?

07:36.610 --> 07:38.450
I don't know.

07:42.410 --> 07:45.410
Christopher Reasley,
at the Woodyard.

07:45.410 --> 07:48.410
We know he gave you a necklace.

07:48.410 --> 07:50.410
Can you tell us about
why he gave you the necklace?

07:51.410 --> 07:53.410
He just did.

07:53.410 --> 07:55.410
Was he the man
you were scared of, Rosa?

07:55.410 --> 07:57.410
When you called 999?

07:57.410 --> 07:59.410
I don't know, I...

07:59.410 --> 08:01.410
I really don't remember anything.

08:05.410 --> 08:06.450
OK.

08:15.410 --> 08:18.410
I knew we should never
have let her go to that place.

08:19.410 --> 08:23.410
Charity's all well and good,
but there's work needs doing here.

08:27.410 --> 08:28.770
It's a beautiful place.

08:28.770 --> 08:32.410
Closer to God here
than in any building.

08:36.410 --> 08:38.410
You weren't born here,
by the sounds of it.

08:40.410 --> 08:42.410
Stepney.
Brixton.

08:44.410 --> 08:46.410
How'd you end up in Devon?

08:46.410 --> 08:49.410
Came here on holiday when I was 19.

08:49.410 --> 08:51.410
Met Dennis
when he was street preaching.

08:51.410 --> 08:55.410
We were married two months later.

08:56.410 --> 08:58.090
I can see why you stayed.

09:01.450 --> 09:04.410
It's a sanctuary...

09:04.410 --> 09:06.410
our church, this place.

09:08.410 --> 09:10.410
Nothing bad gets in.

09:13.410 --> 09:14.930
But something bad did get in.

09:17.250 --> 09:18.410
Did Rosa talk to you?

09:18.410 --> 09:20.410
Grace.
About what happened?

09:21.410 --> 09:24.410
They need your help, my love,
with the seedlings.

09:28.090 --> 09:30.410
Green fingers and green toes.

09:31.410 --> 09:33.250
That's my wife.

09:38.410 --> 09:42.410
Simon Walden went to their church
because he wanted to help Rosa.

09:42.410 --> 09:45.410
He wanted to bring whoever was
hurting her to justice. What if...

09:46.410 --> 09:49.410
What if that someone was Dennis,
and not Christopher?

09:49.410 --> 09:50.450
He's got an alibi
for Rosa's abduction.

09:50.450 --> 09:52.610
He's got an alibi
for the murder, as well.

09:52.610 --> 09:55.090
He was conducting
my father's funeral.

09:55.090 --> 09:57.410
I... I just...

09:57.410 --> 10:00.410
I just think we should try
and talk to Grace.

10:00.410 --> 10:03.410
Yeah, but... Brethren women
are trained to stay silent.

10:03.410 --> 10:05.410
They listen, not talk.

10:07.410 --> 10:09.410
But maybe
she'll talk to an outsider.

10:09.410 --> 10:11.410
I'm sorry, Jen.
You wouldn't get anything,

10:11.410 --> 10:13.410
because you don't understand
their world.

10:13.410 --> 10:15.250
No outsiders,
and certainly no police.

10:15.250 --> 10:18.410
If you charged in there,
we'd lose Grace and we lose Dennis.

10:19.410 --> 10:21.410
I'll drop you at the station.

10:42.410 --> 10:45.410
Are your parents local, Jonathan?

10:45.410 --> 10:48.930
My dad lives in Spain.
And my mum's in Sydney.

10:50.410 --> 10:53.250
Australia?
Mm.

10:55.410 --> 10:57.770
She, er... She remarried.

10:57.770 --> 11:00.410
They divorced when I was a kid.
Oh.

11:01.410 --> 11:03.410
Sorry to hear that.

11:03.410 --> 11:05.610
That's why we're happy
to have you nearby.

11:07.450 --> 11:09.410
I just think, as you get older,

11:09.410 --> 11:11.410
you just sort of feel that pull
to be closer to your family.

11:13.250 --> 11:14.410
I know Matthew does.

11:24.410 --> 11:27.410
I never understood, you know,
the way...

11:28.410 --> 11:32.770
..young worldly folk have to go
off, halfway across the country.

11:35.090 --> 11:39.410
Lot I don't understand
about the modern world, I suppose.

11:39.410 --> 11:42.410
Well, it's not that different
from yours.

11:42.410 --> 11:45.410
People still want a home. A family.

11:46.410 --> 11:48.410
Love.

11:58.410 --> 12:00.410
Er...

12:00.410 --> 12:01.410
Shall we, erm...

12:02.410 --> 12:04.410
Shall we give you the tour?

12:07.410 --> 12:09.410
Still a work in progress.

12:10.410 --> 12:12.450
We spent months
just stopping the weather coming in.

12:14.410 --> 12:16.410
Oh, well, he says "we".

12:16.410 --> 12:18.410
It was all...
It was all him, really.

12:19.450 --> 12:23.410
Well, Matt can't be trusted with an
angle grinder, as I'm sure you know.

12:27.410 --> 12:30.410
That's the, er...
the master bedroom.

12:36.410 --> 12:38.410
Like something from a painting.

12:41.410 --> 12:45.410
Yeah, well, erm...
All you can hear is the wind

12:45.410 --> 12:48.770
and the... the sound of the gulls.

12:48.770 --> 12:50.410
Beautiful.

12:51.410 --> 12:54.770
The light. The view.

12:57.410 --> 13:01.410
You've made a...
a real home for yourselves.

13:16.410 --> 13:18.410
Sir?

13:18.410 --> 13:21.410
We've got the court order.
We know where Walden's money went.

13:36.410 --> 13:39.410
Gaby... it doesn't look good.

13:42.410 --> 13:45.410
I was protecting it.
It was for his own good.

13:45.410 --> 13:49.410
He was depressed.
He was being weird.

13:49.410 --> 13:50.450
Weird about what?

13:52.410 --> 13:55.410
That night,
he started going on about money.

13:55.410 --> 13:59.410
Saying he was gonna give
his whole 200 grand to this place.

13:59.410 --> 14:01.410
Did he say why?

14:01.410 --> 14:04.090
He said he needed to save it.

14:04.090 --> 14:07.410
Cos it might be going under soon.
Some scandal.

14:08.410 --> 14:11.090
Said he didn't need it
for himself any more.

14:11.090 --> 14:13.410
He was gonna join that cult.

14:13.410 --> 14:14.930
Join The Brethren?

14:14.930 --> 14:18.410
He thought they'd... cure him.

14:21.410 --> 14:23.410
You've committed
a serious crime here, Gaby.

14:23.410 --> 14:26.450
For your own good,
I advise you to tell us now

14:26.450 --> 14:29.410
if you know anything else that could
be relevant to our investigation.

14:34.250 --> 14:37.410
The night before he died,
he went out for a drink.

14:37.410 --> 14:40.410
To the Newland Hotel,
up on the headland.

14:40.410 --> 14:42.410
Was he meeting someone?

14:42.410 --> 14:44.410
I don't know.

14:45.410 --> 14:47.410
You believe her, sir?

14:47.410 --> 14:50.410
She only took the money
to stop Walden giving it away?

14:50.410 --> 14:52.410
Well, that tallies
with what we know.

14:52.410 --> 14:54.610
He did have plans to give it away.
The question is, why?

14:54.610 --> 14:57.410
What was this "scandal" he was
trying to save the Woodyard from?

14:57.410 --> 14:59.450
Bet Rosa knows, sir.

14:59.450 --> 15:01.410
Yeah, there's someone else
who might know, too.

15:01.410 --> 15:04.410
Someone who knows the Woodyard
better than anyone else

15:04.410 --> 15:06.250
and who met with Walden secretly
more than once.

15:07.410 --> 15:08.410
Lucy Craddle.

15:08.410 --> 15:11.410
Lucy knows that Rosa and Walden
were involved in some way.

15:11.410 --> 15:13.410
We thought she might have been
trying to hide their relationship.

15:13.410 --> 15:16.410
But what if she was hiding
something else altogether?

15:16.410 --> 15:18.410
Like why Walden was killed.

15:27.410 --> 15:29.410
Where's, er, Lucy, Maurice?

15:31.410 --> 15:35.410
I don't know. Probably with Alfie.

15:35.410 --> 15:37.410
The Woodyard said
that she left an hour ago.

15:37.410 --> 15:39.410
Shouldn't she be home by now?

15:40.410 --> 15:42.410
What do you want
to talk to her about?

15:44.410 --> 15:46.410
Are those Lucy's?

15:49.250 --> 15:51.410
The trainers?

15:51.410 --> 15:53.410
Yeah.

15:58.410 --> 16:00.410
Size five.

16:00.410 --> 16:02.410
We're gonna need
to take these, Maurice.

16:13.410 --> 16:15.410
Oh, hi! Hi.
It's Jen, right?

16:15.410 --> 16:16.770
Yeah.
Ross?

16:16.770 --> 16:18.410
Hiya, mate. You all right?

16:18.410 --> 16:20.930
Yeah, I was, erm...
just going to the Newland Hotel,

16:20.930 --> 16:22.770
got a lead on the murder case.
But you're busy...

16:22.770 --> 16:25.410
It's all right. I'll take her.
You sure? Yeah.

16:25.410 --> 16:27.410
Yeah. Good. Go.
Hey, go to Mummy.

16:27.410 --> 16:30.410
Daddy going to work. I'll call you
when I'm done, all right?

16:30.410 --> 16:33.410
Bye, see ya.
Bye.

16:33.410 --> 16:34.410
Bye!

16:34.410 --> 16:35.410
Hi.
Hiya.

16:37.410 --> 16:41.410
I think I owe you a pint.

16:54.410 --> 16:56.410
Thought you could do with this.

16:56.410 --> 16:58.410
Ed told me about your dad.

17:00.410 --> 17:02.410
You not having one?

17:05.610 --> 17:07.410
I'm pregnant.

17:09.410 --> 17:12.410
Shit. Simon's?

17:12.410 --> 17:14.410
Who else would it be?

17:14.410 --> 17:17.090
H-How far along?

17:17.090 --> 17:19.410
Eight weeks.

17:19.410 --> 17:21.410
It's total madness.

17:21.410 --> 17:23.410
Yeah.

17:23.410 --> 17:25.410
Oh, but it's amazing.

17:31.930 --> 17:34.410
Yeah.
Was here for a couple of hours.

17:34.410 --> 17:36.410
On his own?
Was a quiet shift.

17:36.410 --> 17:38.450
He was pretty much
the only one in here.

17:43.410 --> 17:45.410
Waiting for someone?

17:45.410 --> 17:48.410
Yeah... And they didn't turn up.

17:51.410 --> 17:54.410
I shouldn't've called you
a "rugby twat".

17:54.410 --> 17:57.410
To be fair, it's pretty accurate,
what you said.

17:57.410 --> 18:02.410
Never been up North.
Only ever been to London twice.

18:02.410 --> 18:04.410
I mean, to be fair,
if I was you, I...

18:04.410 --> 18:06.410
probably wouldn't leave home either.

18:06.410 --> 18:09.930
Your wife's lovely. And your baby.
Ah, they're all right.

18:09.930 --> 18:12.410
You've got two, right?
Yeah.

18:12.410 --> 18:16.410
One is hard enough.

18:16.410 --> 18:18.410
Don't know how you do it alone.

18:18.410 --> 18:20.410
Oh, they're old enough to forage.

18:20.410 --> 18:23.410
What about their dad?
Guess you don't see him much?

18:24.610 --> 18:27.410
Yeah. City folk don't normally
move to a place like this

18:27.410 --> 18:31.410
unless they're...
they're running away from something.

18:31.410 --> 18:33.410
Anyway, cheers for this.

18:36.930 --> 18:39.410
I've never heard my mother
talk so much about her life.

18:39.410 --> 18:41.410
Wait till I get her
on the prosecco.

18:42.770 --> 18:44.410
Yeah, right.

18:47.410 --> 18:50.410
I wish I could be more like you are
about it.

18:51.410 --> 18:53.410
What, shameless?
I don't know.

18:54.450 --> 18:56.410
Less self-conscious.

19:01.090 --> 19:02.410
Babe, none of this is your fault.

19:05.410 --> 19:08.410
They taught you that gays were part
of Satan's army, for Christ's sake.

19:08.410 --> 19:11.410
Just take it steady, OK?

19:13.090 --> 19:14.930
It's a lot.

19:16.410 --> 19:17.410
For you both.

20:12.410 --> 20:15.410
I baptise you
in the name of the Father,

20:15.410 --> 20:18.410
and the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

20:37.410 --> 20:40.410
Come on, let's get you out,
into something warm.

20:51.410 --> 20:52.410
Here you go, my love.

20:52.410 --> 20:56.410
Hope the water wasn't too cold.
It was OK.

20:56.410 --> 20:59.410
After what she's been through,
she felt ready to commit.

20:59.410 --> 21:02.930
To the church, and the community.
Didn't you, love?

21:07.410 --> 21:10.410
Were you able to remember
anything else about what happened?

21:10.410 --> 21:13.410
It's all just... blurry.

21:15.410 --> 21:17.930
Come on. Let's get you warm.

21:53.410 --> 21:55.410
Do you know anything
about Simon Walden?

21:57.410 --> 22:00.410
About why he was helping Rosa?

22:04.410 --> 22:05.450
Of course not.

22:08.410 --> 22:10.410
Does Dennis?

22:14.410 --> 22:16.410
Whatever you were to tell me, he...

22:17.410 --> 22:19.410
..he wouldn't have to know.

22:34.410 --> 22:36.410
You're scared of him,
aren't you, Grace?

22:41.410 --> 22:43.410
I can remember at meetings.

22:45.410 --> 22:46.410
How...

22:48.250 --> 22:50.410
..closed you always seemed to be.

22:50.410 --> 22:51.930
People used to say
it was your nerves.

22:51.930 --> 22:54.410
But it wasn't just that, was it?

22:54.410 --> 22:55.410
It was him.

23:00.410 --> 23:02.610
I'm fragile, Matthew.

23:04.090 --> 23:05.410
Always have been.

23:09.410 --> 23:11.410
Dennis saved me.

23:11.410 --> 23:14.250
I wouldn't have survived
without him.

23:14.250 --> 23:16.410
Maybe that's what
he's made you believe.

23:22.250 --> 23:25.410
I couldn't help you then,
but I can help you now.

23:25.410 --> 23:26.410
If you talk to me.

23:32.410 --> 23:34.410
Grace...

23:34.410 --> 23:36.410
Somebody hurt Rosa.

23:36.410 --> 23:38.930
Maybe the same person
who killed Simon Walden,

23:38.930 --> 23:41.410
and I think
she's staying quiet about it

23:41.410 --> 23:44.410
for the same reason
you stay quiet about Dennis.

23:44.410 --> 23:46.410
Fear.

23:48.410 --> 23:51.410
Do you want her to live
a life like yours, Grace?

24:04.410 --> 24:08.090
The silence in the women.
The subservience.

24:08.090 --> 24:10.410
I remember it as a kid.
I saw it in Grace.

24:10.410 --> 24:13.410
I see it in Rosa now.
We won't get anything from them.

24:17.410 --> 24:20.410
Ross?
It's Lucy's shoe, boss.

24:20.410 --> 24:23.410
'It's a match
to the footprint on the beach.'

24:23.410 --> 24:25.410
Lucy was at the murder scene.

24:29.250 --> 24:32.410
Maid? Can you come down?

24:34.410 --> 24:36.410
I need you to be honest with me.

24:36.410 --> 24:39.410
About where you were
the morning Simon Walden died.

24:39.410 --> 24:42.410
What you on about?
I know you've been lying to me.

24:42.410 --> 24:44.410
And to the police.
I haven't.

24:44.410 --> 24:47.410
Has Alfie got
you into this somehow?

24:47.410 --> 24:48.410
Lucy?

24:48.410 --> 24:52.410
You knew they were coming?
I made a promise to your mum

24:52.410 --> 24:53.770
that I'd keep you safe.
Lucy?

24:53.770 --> 24:55.410
And you're not any more.

24:56.410 --> 24:58.410
Lucy, it's DI Venn.
Can you open the door?

25:06.090 --> 25:09.410
'What do you know about Alfie?'
'Seems like a lovely guy.'

25:09.410 --> 25:11.770
And is... is Lucy...

25:11.770 --> 25:14.410
capable of consenting
to a relationship?

25:14.410 --> 25:15.410
Well, I'd say yes.

25:15.410 --> 25:17.410
I think everyone
has a right to a sex life.

25:18.410 --> 25:20.610
Did you know about them, Jon?

25:20.610 --> 25:23.410
I knew they were mates.

25:27.410 --> 25:29.410
'She started things.'

25:29.410 --> 25:31.410
'She followed me to the arcade
one night.'

25:31.410 --> 25:33.410
It... went from there.

25:35.410 --> 25:36.410
What, you started having sex?

25:37.610 --> 25:39.770
It was more than that.

25:43.610 --> 25:47.410
But you kept it secret.

25:47.410 --> 25:51.410
We didn't tell people...
because we knew they'd judge us.

25:51.410 --> 25:54.410
Like you're doing now.

25:54.410 --> 25:55.410
Like her dad.

25:56.410 --> 25:59.410
Who thinks she's a kid
who can't look after herself.

26:00.930 --> 26:03.250
Well, she's not.

26:07.410 --> 26:09.250
She's a woman.

26:11.410 --> 26:14.410
I know you were at the scene
of Simon's murder.

26:14.410 --> 26:16.410
And that you met with him secretly
before he died.

26:18.410 --> 26:20.410
I need you to tell me what you know.

26:20.410 --> 26:24.410
About Simon, about Rosa,
about what they were doing.

26:25.410 --> 26:27.410
And how he ended up dead.

26:27.410 --> 26:30.610
Lucy,
lying to the police is a crime.

26:30.610 --> 26:32.410
Do you understand that?

26:32.410 --> 26:35.410
It's not my secret to tell.

26:48.410 --> 26:51.410
It was lovely, seeing you
in the water this morning.

26:52.410 --> 26:55.090
I thought it would
make me feel better.

26:57.410 --> 26:59.410
Cleaner.

27:00.610 --> 27:02.610
You can talk to me, Rosa.

27:04.410 --> 27:06.410
About what happened.

27:07.410 --> 27:09.410
Dennis said
I should only talk to God...

27:11.410 --> 27:13.410
..and him.

27:13.410 --> 27:16.410
He said the same thing to me
when I first arrived here.

27:17.410 --> 27:19.770
The only way to find peace...

27:20.930 --> 27:22.930
..was to submit to God...

27:24.450 --> 27:26.770
..and to him.

27:29.410 --> 27:30.610
Did it work?

27:42.410 --> 27:43.410
No.

28:02.410 --> 28:03.770
Whenever you're ready.

28:10.410 --> 28:13.410
I've told her
I'll help her raise the baby.

28:13.410 --> 28:15.410
They'll be living with us here.

28:17.410 --> 28:19.250
Right.

28:19.250 --> 28:20.410
Could be fun.

28:21.610 --> 28:23.410
Like a commune.

28:24.410 --> 28:28.410
And then, if we ever...

28:30.410 --> 28:31.410
What?

28:32.410 --> 28:34.410
..have one...

28:35.770 --> 28:38.410
You know I want three, at least.

28:52.410 --> 28:54.410
Er...

28:55.410 --> 28:57.410
What are you doing with these?

29:02.450 --> 29:04.410
He's your dad, Caz.

29:05.410 --> 29:07.410
This isn't about me.

29:07.410 --> 29:10.610
This is about Simon and Gaby,
and their baby.

29:12.410 --> 29:14.410
I'm going to confront him today.

29:17.410 --> 29:19.410
It was at the Woodyard.

29:20.410 --> 29:22.410
About two months ago.

29:23.410 --> 29:26.610
I'd been volunteering there
one afternoon a week.

29:28.410 --> 29:30.090
After we'd finished the session,

29:30.090 --> 29:32.450
the volunteers
wanted to stay for drinks.

29:32.450 --> 29:34.770
At the cafe.

29:34.770 --> 29:38.410
I thought, if I stayed for
half an hour, Mum'd never know.

29:38.410 --> 29:41.610
They bought bottles of wine.

29:41.610 --> 29:44.410
Someone kept topping my glass up.

29:46.090 --> 29:48.410
I knew I needed to go home.

29:48.410 --> 29:52.410
I went outside. I was... so woozy.

29:54.410 --> 29:56.410
He came out after me.

29:59.410 --> 30:03.410
To... help me, he said.

30:03.410 --> 30:07.450
The next thing I know,
he's pushing me up against the wall.

30:10.410 --> 30:13.610
He had his hands in my shirt,
on my...

30:18.410 --> 30:20.450
The worst thing is,
I didn't even tell him no.

30:22.410 --> 30:25.410
I just... froze.

30:25.410 --> 30:29.410
That doesn't make
what he did any less of a crime.

30:32.410 --> 30:34.410
'I'm going to the police.'

30:35.410 --> 30:37.250
To DI Venn. I'm giving him this.

30:38.930 --> 30:41.090
You've been lying to me for weeks.

30:43.410 --> 30:45.410
I need to talk to my daughter alone.

30:45.410 --> 30:47.410
I want Ed here.

30:47.410 --> 30:49.410
I said go. Now.

30:58.450 --> 31:00.930
'Simon came outside.'

31:02.410 --> 31:03.410
He stopped him.

31:03.410 --> 31:06.410
So Simon Walden was there?

31:06.410 --> 31:08.410
He was one of the volunteers.

31:09.410 --> 31:13.090
And... how did you get home?

31:13.090 --> 31:15.410
Brother Dennis picked me up.

31:16.610 --> 31:19.410
He could see
that something had happened.

31:20.450 --> 31:24.410
He said, "This is what happens
out in the world."

31:27.410 --> 31:29.410
Did you tell anyone else about it?

31:29.410 --> 31:32.410
We went to Mr Reasley.

31:32.410 --> 31:38.090
He... gave me the necklace
to shut me up, I think.

31:39.410 --> 31:43.410
Then Simon turned up
at a meeting a few days later.

31:43.410 --> 31:46.770
He said he could help me
if I wanted to go the police.

31:46.770 --> 31:50.410
He said the man who'd done it
had got drunk.

31:50.410 --> 31:53.410
He'd talked about what'd happened.

31:53.410 --> 31:58.410
So the man had confided in Simon
about... what he'd done to you?

32:00.410 --> 32:01.450
Simon had recorded it.

32:01.450 --> 32:04.770
On his phone. Secretly.

32:06.410 --> 32:09.410
He said we could go to the police.

32:09.410 --> 32:13.930
I swear to you, the police
got it wrong about Rosa and me.

32:13.930 --> 32:17.610
Why do you have a non-disclosure
agreement with Simon's name on?

32:17.610 --> 32:19.410
Do you know something
about his death?

32:19.410 --> 32:21.410
No.

32:21.410 --> 32:25.410
I asked him to sign this,
he refused. That's all.

32:25.410 --> 32:27.770
Why did you want him to sign it?

32:27.770 --> 32:33.410
Because he knew of an allegation
that had been made.

32:33.410 --> 32:35.410
By Rosa.

32:36.410 --> 32:39.610
There's no doubt in my mind
she'd made something out of nothing.

32:39.610 --> 32:42.250
Spreading it as gossip
would have been

32:42.250 --> 32:44.410
pointlessly destructive
to the Woodyard.

32:46.410 --> 32:49.410
And it would have been
pointlessly hurtful to you.

32:49.410 --> 32:51.610
To me?

32:51.610 --> 32:55.410
It wasn't me
she made the allegation about.

32:55.410 --> 32:57.410
Who was it?

32:59.410 --> 33:03.410
Rosa, what was the name of the man
who assaulted you?

33:06.410 --> 33:08.410
Dad, who was it?

33:12.410 --> 33:14.410
Rosa?

33:16.410 --> 33:17.410
Ed.

33:19.410 --> 33:21.610
Caroline?

33:21.610 --> 33:23.610
Ed Raveley.

33:34.410 --> 33:37.090
Tell us about the chalet.

33:38.410 --> 33:41.410
Me and Lucy had been there
once before with Simon.

33:41.410 --> 33:44.410
To talk in private
about what happened.

33:44.410 --> 33:46.770
Ed must've found out I'd been there.

33:46.770 --> 33:50.410
After Simon died, Ed came
and found me at the Woodyard.

33:50.410 --> 33:53.410
He was asking
for the address of the chalet.

33:53.410 --> 33:56.410
I thought maybe
he knew something about the murder.

33:58.410 --> 34:00.410
Maybe he was the one who done it.

34:00.410 --> 34:02.410
So I went after him.

34:03.770 --> 34:09.410
I was so scared,
but angry, too, about Simon.

34:11.410 --> 34:14.610
I saw Ed looking for something.

34:14.610 --> 34:18.410
I thought maybe for Simon's phone.

34:18.410 --> 34:21.410
I tried to stay quiet,
but he realised I was there.

34:23.410 --> 34:25.410
He took me inside,
and he wouldn't let me leave.

34:28.410 --> 34:30.410
And that's when you called 999?

34:34.410 --> 34:36.410
He tried to grab my phone.

34:38.410 --> 34:43.770
I don't think he meant to hurt me,
but... I fell and hit my head.

34:43.770 --> 34:47.410
And when I woke up,
it was dark and he was gone.

34:47.410 --> 34:51.410
I was all confused,
and my head was bleeding.

34:55.930 --> 34:57.410
Rosa...

34:59.410 --> 35:00.410
..did Ed know that Simon

35:00.410 --> 35:03.410
had recorded their conversation
on his phone?

35:04.410 --> 35:05.930
I don't know.

35:11.410 --> 35:14.090
Is it my fault Simon died?

35:15.410 --> 35:18.410
No.
Rosa...

35:18.410 --> 35:21.410
none of this is your fault.

35:21.410 --> 35:22.410
OK?

35:43.410 --> 35:45.410
Where are you?

36:03.410 --> 36:06.770
I came to this beach for the
first time a week after I arrived.

36:08.410 --> 36:11.410
After all the shit
I'd been through in London.

36:13.090 --> 36:15.410
I thought to myself...

36:15.410 --> 36:18.410
"You know, one day,
I'll bring a girl here.

36:18.410 --> 36:21.410
"She'll fall in love with me, and
we'll have our happy-ever-after."

36:22.410 --> 36:24.930
I know. About Rosa.

36:26.610 --> 36:28.410
About what you did.

36:35.410 --> 36:38.450
It was before we were properly
together. I didn't cheat on you.

36:38.450 --> 36:40.410
You think this is about cheating?

36:42.250 --> 36:43.410
I'm not some predator.

36:43.410 --> 36:45.410
It wasn't like that.

36:45.410 --> 36:47.450
She didn't tell me to stop, Caz.

36:47.450 --> 36:50.410
Oh... Look, I know she was drunk
and it was wrong...

36:50.410 --> 36:55.410
No. You don't get to explain
or justify anything.

36:55.410 --> 36:59.410
What you did was a crime,
and you know it.

37:01.610 --> 37:03.410
Help me, Caz.

37:06.410 --> 37:10.410
I loved you.
Look, let's just go.

37:10.410 --> 37:13.410
Get out of here, just get
a flight somewhere, tonight.

37:13.410 --> 37:14.410
Please, Caz!

37:18.410 --> 37:20.410
Are there others?

37:21.410 --> 37:24.090
Others?
Other girls.

37:24.090 --> 37:26.410
No! I swear, no.

37:28.410 --> 37:32.410
Look, it's you I want.
It's only ever been you.

37:35.410 --> 37:37.410
So, please, help me.

38:06.410 --> 38:08.410
- Grace?
- We're here to see Ruth.

38:18.410 --> 38:20.410
Er, Ruth. Rosa's safe.

38:20.410 --> 38:24.410
She's at the station.
Oh...

38:24.410 --> 38:27.410
We've been out of our minds
with worry.

38:27.410 --> 38:29.610
Er, she came of her own choice.

38:29.610 --> 38:34.090
We know what she's been through.
We know that she was assaulted...

38:34.090 --> 38:36.930
and you told her to say nothing.

38:41.410 --> 38:43.410
What should we have done, Matthew?

38:43.410 --> 38:47.410
Come to me.
To seek justice for her?

38:49.410 --> 38:53.410
Terrible things happen
in your world, Matthew.

38:53.410 --> 38:57.410
And we should never have let her
go there alone. I blame myself.

38:57.410 --> 39:00.410
But I couldn't make her
drag it up for the police.

39:00.410 --> 39:02.930
I couldn't put her through that.
No.

39:02.930 --> 39:05.410
You mean you couldn't
put yourself through that.

39:07.410 --> 39:10.410
Your idea of justice
isn't the only one.

39:15.410 --> 39:17.410
Everyone's a victim nowadays.

39:19.090 --> 39:21.250
Everyone's got a grievance.

39:21.250 --> 39:25.410
They're airing it in court,
or on television.

39:25.410 --> 39:29.410
But in our world, Matthew,
only God deals out justice.

39:29.410 --> 39:31.410
All that matters is being safe...

39:33.250 --> 39:35.410
..with your family.

39:35.410 --> 39:37.090
But she wasn't safe,
was she, Dennis?

39:40.090 --> 39:42.410
You didn't keep her safe.
Neither did God.

39:42.410 --> 39:44.410
Matthew!

39:44.410 --> 39:46.410
That's enough.

39:55.410 --> 39:57.410
Go home, Matthew.

39:58.410 --> 40:00.410
Home. Now.

40:14.410 --> 40:16.410
Matthew?

40:16.410 --> 40:19.410
Brother Dennis is a good man.

40:19.410 --> 40:21.410
He lives according to
his principles.

40:21.410 --> 40:24.410
Do you really believe that?
He terrorises Grace.

40:24.410 --> 40:28.410
He has done their entire marriage.
Grace is a troubled woman.

40:28.410 --> 40:30.410
He's spent his life
taking care of her.

40:30.410 --> 40:32.410
She's scared of him, Mum.

40:32.410 --> 40:36.410
Scared! I remember it as a kid.
The power he had over all of us.

40:37.450 --> 40:40.610
It feels like warmth,
but it's not. It's control.

40:40.610 --> 40:44.410
He's a coercive,
bullying narcissist,

40:44.410 --> 40:46.410
and he has used your church
for his own ego.

40:46.410 --> 40:48.410
He stands by us. By our community.

40:48.410 --> 40:49.770
He treats his wife
like his property!

40:49.770 --> 40:52.410
Maybe you don't understand
normal marriage.

40:58.410 --> 41:01.410
I didn't invite you back
into my life.

41:02.930 --> 41:05.410
You invited yourself.

41:09.450 --> 41:12.410
It's not too late for you, Matthew.

41:12.410 --> 41:15.410
Let us help you re-find the light.

41:31.410 --> 41:34.450
It wasn't you. Was it?

41:37.930 --> 41:39.770
It was Dennis.

41:42.410 --> 41:46.450
Was it his idea?
His idea for you to meet Jonathan?

41:50.410 --> 41:52.410
Yeah... Yes.

41:57.410 --> 42:01.410
Jonathan's a good man.
Anyone can see that.

42:01.410 --> 42:03.090
But he's still a man.

42:04.410 --> 42:06.410
I've tried, Matthew.

42:06.410 --> 42:10.090
I wanted to make my peace with it,
for both of us.

42:12.410 --> 42:14.410
But it'll never be right.

42:15.410 --> 42:17.410
It'll never not be a sin.

42:25.090 --> 42:26.410
OK.

42:29.410 --> 42:30.770
Matthew...

42:40.450 --> 42:42.410
So, what now?

42:42.410 --> 42:44.410
We pack some stuff...

42:45.410 --> 42:47.410
..and go.

43:16.410 --> 43:17.410
What?

43:23.410 --> 43:24.410
No.

43:25.410 --> 43:27.410
I never want to see you again.

43:32.770 --> 43:35.410
Rosa's told us
what happened to her.

43:36.610 --> 43:38.410
That you and Simon
were helping her.

43:38.410 --> 43:42.410
I always looked out for her
since she started volunteering.

43:42.410 --> 43:46.610
She told me
about what happened with Ed.

43:46.610 --> 43:50.610
But you knew how damaging
it could be for the Woodyard.

43:52.450 --> 43:55.410
That's what Simon was going to use
his money for, wasn't it?

43:55.410 --> 43:57.770
To save the Woodyard,
if he needed to.

43:59.410 --> 44:03.410
You were there, on Crow Point,
the morning he was killed.

44:03.410 --> 44:07.410
We were meant to meet there.
Go to the police.

44:07.410 --> 44:11.410
But I got there,
and he was lying there.

44:11.410 --> 44:14.410
And I just ran.

44:14.410 --> 44:17.090
He just wanted to help them.

44:17.090 --> 44:19.250
He wanted to help "them"?

44:19.250 --> 44:22.450
Was Simon helping someone else
apart from Rosa?

44:22.450 --> 44:27.410
He said no-one should
be frightened all the time.

44:39.450 --> 44:41.410
"Therefore...

44:41.410 --> 44:45.610
"let not sin reign
in your mortal body.

44:47.410 --> 44:53.410
"Present yourselves to God as those
who have been brought from death..."

44:55.410 --> 44:59.410
"..to life, as instruments
for righteousness."

45:01.410 --> 45:02.410
Grace.

45:02.410 --> 45:05.770
Simon Walden came to The Brethren
to help Rosa.

45:05.770 --> 45:08.610
But I think he saw someone else
who needed his help even more.

45:09.770 --> 45:13.410
The night before he died,
he went to the Newland Hotel.

45:16.410 --> 45:19.610
I think... he was meant to meet you.

45:19.610 --> 45:23.410
That he wanted to help you
escape Dennis.

45:24.410 --> 45:26.450
I'm right, aren't I?

45:26.450 --> 45:29.930
Grace, help me
and I'll help you, I promise.

45:31.410 --> 45:34.410
"Sin will have
no dominion over you."

45:34.410 --> 45:36.770
Grace. Grace!

45:38.410 --> 45:40.770
"For you are not under law...

45:42.410 --> 45:44.410
"..but under God."

45:54.410 --> 45:56.410
