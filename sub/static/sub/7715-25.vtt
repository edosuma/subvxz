WEBVTT

00:09.109 --> 00:12.568
It's a beautiful
morning at Dunder Mifflin.

00:13.046 --> 00:15.481
Or as I like to
call it, Great Bratton.

00:15.749 --> 00:17.149
Keep it running.

00:18.185 --> 00:20.381
Do I love being manager?

00:21.188 --> 00:23.589
I love my kids.
I love real estate.

00:23.724 --> 00:26.125
I love ceramics.
I love my job.

00:26.193 --> 00:27.354
I love wrestling.

00:27.794 --> 00:29.456
Find out what
language this is.

00:36.537 --> 00:38.699
Okay, team building.

00:38.772 --> 00:44.109
On this side of the room, Stanley,
Phyllis, Jim, Ted, Elroy.

00:44.177 --> 00:48.046
And on this side of the room,
Pam, Meredith, Phyllis, Creed...

00:48.682 --> 00:50.344
He never called a meeting.

00:51.351 --> 00:53.479
Boboddy. Boboddy.

00:53.554 --> 00:56.149
What does the first
"B" stand for?

00:56.823 --> 00:57.813
What are we doing?

00:57.891 --> 01:01.692
We're making acronyms. Okay! What
does the first "B" stand for?

01:01.828 --> 01:03.490
Um, business!

01:03.797 --> 01:04.890
I like it!

01:05.799 --> 01:07.893
Business. Good, Kevin!

01:07.968 --> 01:09.698
All right, the "O."

01:10.404 --> 01:12.168
We need a new manager.

01:53.380 --> 01:55.144
So, after the Navy,
I thought,

01:55.215 --> 01:58.708
"Cool, me and America are square.
I've done my bit for the flag,

01:58.785 --> 02:00.879
"and time for me
to look out for myself."

02:00.954 --> 02:03.423
I had a buddy in the paper
biz so I just dove right in.

02:03.490 --> 02:05.083
How was your experience
in the Navy?

02:05.158 --> 02:06.592
It was nuts. Yeah.

02:06.893 --> 02:08.520
I was in Hong Kong
three times.

02:08.595 --> 02:10.586
Still have pretty
crazy flashbacks from that.

02:10.663 --> 02:12.792
Really? What kind of thing
did you do?

02:12.866 --> 02:14.061
Meteorologist.

02:14.134 --> 02:15.762
What do you mean, like
weather surveillance, or...

02:15.836 --> 02:18.704
Predictor. Constantly had
to predict the weather,

02:18.772 --> 02:21.537
which is... I'm not a god.
I'm just a guy in a shack

02:21.608 --> 02:22.906
with a pair
of binoculars.

02:22.976 --> 02:24.569
What do you think about this
weather we're having now?

02:24.645 --> 02:26.341
Don't even talk to me
about the weather, man.

02:26.413 --> 02:28.382
It just all comes
back to me, you know?

02:28.448 --> 02:31.384
There was this one night I
predicted it was gonna be warm.

02:32.419 --> 02:34.411
I sent 200 men out
without their jackets.

02:36.156 --> 02:37.988
It was 60 degrees
that night,

02:38.859 --> 02:40.350
52, with windchill.

02:42.162 --> 02:45.098
You can't imagine their faces shivering
through that Carrie Underwood concert.

02:47.401 --> 02:49.563
Your paper experience
is very interesting.

02:49.636 --> 02:51.537
And although
it's mostly manufacturing,

02:51.605 --> 02:54.632
do you think you could use that
experience to inform decisions here?

02:55.175 --> 02:56.643
Absolutely, yes.

02:57.010 --> 02:59.445
In fact, I actually
have a three-step plan

02:59.513 --> 03:01.948
that I believe could effectively
double your profits.

03:02.015 --> 03:03.313
Really?
Yeah.

03:05.085 --> 03:06.075
What is it?

03:07.688 --> 03:09.782
Nice try.

03:12.159 --> 03:15.493
I'm sorry. What is
your three-step plan?

03:15.696 --> 03:17.631
Well, I mean, I can't
just hand you my plan.

03:18.398 --> 03:20.697
I mean, if you guys give me the
job, then you'll get the plan.

03:21.635 --> 03:24.901
Well, it's an interview, and we don't
know that you really have the plan.

03:24.971 --> 03:26.963
I'm not gonna just make
up that I have a plan.

03:27.040 --> 03:30.101
I got a plan. Believe me, you guys want it.
You're in paper, right?

03:30.177 --> 03:31.702
How do we know
that if you don't...

03:31.778 --> 03:33.269
You could just be saying
it to get the job.

03:33.346 --> 03:35.315
I guess I could be
if I was...

03:35.882 --> 03:37.783
Who would do that?
How about this,

03:37.851 --> 03:40.116
why don't you give
us a part of the plan,

03:40.187 --> 03:41.655
and that way we
know you have it.

03:41.722 --> 03:44.556
Tell you what? I'll give you
part three of part two.

03:44.725 --> 03:46.489
Not gonna give
you a whole part.

03:46.560 --> 03:47.550
Okay.

03:48.462 --> 03:51.398
Color-code
said documents. T.M.

03:53.467 --> 03:55.265
Did you just trademark that?
What?

03:55.402 --> 03:57.303
That's a verbal trademark.
That's an agreement.

03:58.238 --> 04:01.697
We are the search committee,
hand-picked by our CEO

04:01.775 --> 04:04.108
and tasked to find this
branch's new manager.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.372
Not everyone we
meet will be good,

04:06.747 --> 04:08.875
but someone's
bound to be, right?

04:08.982 --> 04:10.143
And to be honest,

04:10.250 --> 04:13.049
I think a lot of the decent
candidates are right here in house.

04:13.186 --> 04:14.654
So, I'm not too worried.

04:15.088 --> 04:17.956
But I'm really excited to spend a
lot of time with Toby and Gabe.

04:18.591 --> 04:20.788
Did you know that Gabe's
last name was Lewis?

04:21.528 --> 04:22.757
I had no idea.

04:23.430 --> 04:24.454
Good morning.

04:24.531 --> 04:25.897
Morning.
Good morning.

04:26.299 --> 04:27.562
Good morning.

04:27.634 --> 04:29.227
Did you have
a nice drive in?

04:30.370 --> 04:31.565
I did.

04:32.572 --> 04:35.736
I have a solid relationship
with Jo, the company's owner.

04:35.942 --> 04:37.535
I have management experience.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.739
I have a good
friendship with Jim,

04:39.813 --> 04:41.372
the head of
the search committee.

04:41.515 --> 04:43.984
And it doesn't hurt that I'm

04:45.752 --> 04:48.381
black!

04:49.289 --> 04:52.020
We all know this
is a popularity contest.

04:52.092 --> 04:54.357
And Darryl's
the coolest kid in school.

04:54.427 --> 04:58.330
Used to be Jim. Hasn't
been Jim in a long time.

05:01.735 --> 05:02.725
It's good.

05:03.170 --> 05:05.662
It's just words,
which will surprise people.

05:05.739 --> 05:09.176
Yeah. It's based on a really successful
cigarette ad campaign from a while back.

05:09.242 --> 05:10.403
Those were good ads.
Yeah.

05:10.477 --> 05:11.945
They got me smoking
when I was eight.

05:12.012 --> 05:15.540
I couldn't quit smoking until the government
put out better ads about not smoking.

05:16.883 --> 05:18.181
I love smoking.

05:18.852 --> 05:20.081
I really hope you get it.

05:20.153 --> 05:22.452
The manager job?
No, I'm barely interested.

05:22.622 --> 05:25.285
I just can't not go for it, you know.
It's not the Bernard way.

05:25.358 --> 05:27.088
We give it
the old college try,

05:27.160 --> 05:28.822
and then in defeat,
we show grace.

05:29.729 --> 05:33.461
Still, I'd really like to see this
office with you in the boss's chair.

05:33.533 --> 05:35.695
Don't even...

05:35.769 --> 05:37.635
You in the boss's chair! No.

05:37.704 --> 05:39.900
In my family, you don't
really go out and get things.

05:40.440 --> 05:42.466
If you want something,
you write it on a list

05:42.542 --> 05:44.204
and then the housekeeper
goes out and gets it

05:44.277 --> 05:46.178
on Wednesdays and Fridays.

05:46.646 --> 05:50.674
So, I don't know. I guess you
could say this job is on my list

05:51.284 --> 05:52.980
and we'll see what
Rosa comes back with.

05:58.024 --> 05:59.458
Did you hear anything?

05:59.893 --> 06:02.886
Oh, I'm sure they'll let us
know when they get the results.

06:04.497 --> 06:08.059
It turns out that Erin was born
in the basic time and region

06:08.134 --> 06:09.864
that I gave
away a child.

06:10.103 --> 06:12.231
So Phyllis
might be my mom.

06:12.806 --> 06:15.640
I mean, the chances
are tiny, but...

06:15.709 --> 06:18.110
Yeah, probably not.

06:18.178 --> 06:20.113
I mean, it was
a big year for babies.

06:20.180 --> 06:21.876
Porky's had come out.
Yeah.

06:22.115 --> 06:24.346
I'm sure I was just
another Porky's baby.

06:24.417 --> 06:26.283
But why not find out?
Yeah.

06:32.525 --> 06:34.551
Should you really be
so blatant about that?

06:34.628 --> 06:37.359
They won't make me manager, and I
won't settle for anything less.

06:37.964 --> 06:40.991
I've gone about as far as I can here.
That's obvious.

06:41.368 --> 06:43.064
I'm going to take
my talents elsewhere.

06:43.536 --> 06:46.267
Are you really gonna apply for
work at Scranton Bread Works?

06:46.806 --> 06:50.573
Bread is the paper of the food industry.
You write your sandwich on it.

06:52.245 --> 06:54.009
Can you do any
better on salary?

06:54.080 --> 06:55.878
Unfortunately, that
range is set at corporate.

06:56.283 --> 06:57.808
What about mileage
when I use my car?

06:57.884 --> 06:59.750
I mean, gas ain't cheap,
you know.

06:59.953 --> 07:02.081
We think that 25 cents a
mile is pretty generous.

07:02.155 --> 07:04.522
How about 27 and...

07:04.925 --> 07:06.257
When I make
long-distance calls,

07:06.326 --> 07:08.557
will they be monitored,
or is it on the honor system?

07:10.196 --> 07:11.220
Okay.

07:17.370 --> 07:18.633
How odd!

07:18.705 --> 07:21.641
A very unusual phone call
from the Senator's office.

07:22.175 --> 07:25.805
The Senator wants me to have lunch
with him at the Botanical Gardens.

07:25.879 --> 07:27.438
The Botanical Gardens,

07:27.514 --> 07:29.881
Scranton's hidden gem.

07:31.217 --> 07:33.743
Don't eat any berries
you don't recognize.

07:34.054 --> 07:38.150
How will your experience
selling refinery equipment

07:38.224 --> 07:40.318
translate to our
smaller scale here?

07:40.393 --> 07:41.725
You don't work
in sales, do you?

07:42.796 --> 07:43.923
Human resources.

07:44.331 --> 07:46.857
You see,
I sit across from a man,

07:47.934 --> 07:50.802
I see his face,
I see his eyes.

07:51.805 --> 07:56.004
Now, does it matter if
he wants $100 of paper

07:56.176 --> 07:59.374
or $100 million of deep-sea
drilling equipment?

07:59.446 --> 08:00.778
Don't be a fool.

08:00.847 --> 08:03.476
He wants respect.
He wants love.

08:04.818 --> 08:07.652
He wants to be younger.
He wants to be attractive.

08:08.121 --> 08:11.717
There is no such
thing as a product.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.358
Don't ever think there is.

08:15.128 --> 08:17.563
There is only sex.

08:18.365 --> 08:20.095
Everything is sex.

08:21.267 --> 08:26.763
You understand that what I'm telling
you is a universal truth, Toby?

08:26.973 --> 08:27.997
Yes.

08:29.175 --> 08:31.974
Okay, I am... I'm almost
a little concerned that

08:32.044 --> 08:34.741
you might be overqualified
for the position.

08:34.813 --> 08:37.215
Do you, um... Do you
think that you are?

08:37.450 --> 08:40.784
Do I look like someone who
would waste my own time?

08:41.121 --> 08:42.145
No.

08:45.225 --> 08:47.353
Can you...

08:47.427 --> 08:50.727
You are a man of
great confidence.

08:51.197 --> 08:53.189
Could you speak
a little more to that

08:53.266 --> 08:56.100
and what the role
of confidence

08:57.070 --> 09:00.336
would be in a dialog
with a subordinate?

09:00.940 --> 09:02.135
Will you be heard?

09:02.809 --> 09:04.209
Will you have a voice?

09:04.878 --> 09:06.870
Will I steamroll over you?

09:07.514 --> 09:10.507
Do you feel heard
right now, Jim?

09:12.152 --> 09:14.087
Do you have
a voice right now?

09:15.755 --> 09:17.519
You can answer me.
Yes.

09:17.824 --> 09:19.554
That was your choice,
not mine.

09:20.627 --> 09:23.688
The fallacy is that it
is up to the steamroller.

09:23.930 --> 09:25.762
It is up to the object

09:26.666 --> 09:28.498
whether it will be
flattened or not.

09:28.835 --> 09:31.634
And I can tell just from the small
interaction we've had already,

09:31.704 --> 09:33.400
you won't be
flattened by anybody.

09:33.807 --> 09:36.038
Do you agree with me, Jim?
Yes.

09:36.109 --> 09:37.839
Yes, you do.

09:58.231 --> 09:59.597
He creeps me out.

10:00.800 --> 10:02.735
But I think he
might be a genius.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.602
Dwight, there's a call
for you on line 2.

10:10.143 --> 10:11.372
No, thanks.

10:15.849 --> 10:17.715
He's in the shower.

10:31.664 --> 10:32.962
Good luck, Darryl.

10:33.199 --> 10:34.360
Thank you.

10:36.836 --> 10:38.532
Is that the kind of boss
he would be?

10:38.605 --> 10:41.734
Completely insensitive to the insecurities
of other people in this office

10:41.808 --> 10:43.868
who might also be interviewing
for the manager position

10:43.943 --> 10:46.242
and might also want to be
wished a little bit of luck

10:46.312 --> 10:48.679
'cause they're kind of
spinning out a little bit?

10:49.516 --> 10:52.645
I don't want that kind of boss.
No, thank you. Not good.

10:52.986 --> 10:55.512
Good man, though.
Nice guy. My best friend.

10:56.489 --> 10:57.479
Think about it.

10:57.557 --> 11:01.722
What other mammal, besides humans,
drinks the milk of another mammal?

11:01.895 --> 11:04.455
I mean, you don't see a
bear drinking raccoon milk.

11:04.697 --> 11:06.165
How long have
you been off dairy?

11:06.466 --> 11:09.061
As soon as I can say no to those
two pushers, Ben & Jerry.

11:10.737 --> 11:13.832
So this is cool. I think
we make a good fit.

11:14.274 --> 11:16.641
Oh, we haven't started
the interview yet.

11:17.443 --> 11:18.843
Were you joking?

11:21.214 --> 11:24.207
Uh, yes. I was.

11:24.517 --> 11:25.985
A little joke.

11:26.853 --> 11:29.448
So how would you
go about settling

11:29.522 --> 11:31.753
interpersonal conflicts
within the office?

11:32.559 --> 11:33.959
I thought that was your job.

11:35.028 --> 11:38.192
Well, it's one of my strengths,
but it's the manager's job.

11:39.666 --> 11:41.362
Well, for instance, how
did you deal with it

11:41.434 --> 11:43.426
when two warehouse
guys got into a fight?

11:43.503 --> 11:47.668
I'll answer that, Jim. I would use
it as an opportunity to teach

11:48.308 --> 11:53.042
about actions and
consequences of actions.

12:01.888 --> 12:02.947
Who's that?

12:03.756 --> 12:06.885
So I think all we need is a
resume and we'll be good, right?

12:08.561 --> 12:10.996
I just thought you knew me.
Yeah, it's no big deal.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.965
Just something
that looks like that.

12:13.233 --> 12:14.428
Cool?

12:14.500 --> 12:15.524
Let me...

12:16.302 --> 12:17.292
Oh.

12:18.071 --> 12:19.369
Cool.

12:28.014 --> 12:29.448
Did you just interview?

12:29.515 --> 12:31.245
Oh, unfortunately, yes.

12:35.321 --> 12:36.311
What do you mean?

12:36.889 --> 12:38.517
That business
can't attract anyone.

12:39.425 --> 12:40.723
It's awful up there.

12:41.427 --> 12:45.387
Those people seem like they're in
prison waiting out life sentences

12:45.465 --> 12:47.900
in a dying industry.

12:48.334 --> 12:49.597
Place must be horrible.

12:54.240 --> 12:56.038
I don't know if
I want this job.

12:56.209 --> 12:59.338
Well, if I get this job offer, then
I know that I'm gonna take it.

12:59.412 --> 13:02.280
And if I take it, I know
that I'm never gonna quit.

13:02.348 --> 13:05.546
And then 25 years
are gonna go by,

13:08.021 --> 13:09.489
and I'm gonna die here.

13:09.889 --> 13:13.690
What makes you feel qualified to judge
a place after a mere interview?

13:21.901 --> 13:23.301
What are you doing?

13:27.907 --> 13:29.375
Stop trying
to figure me out.

13:29.442 --> 13:30.910
I just did.
You can't.

13:31.110 --> 13:32.840
It's done.
No, it's not.

13:32.912 --> 13:34.278
I know you now,
your nature.

13:34.347 --> 13:35.713
You don't know me. You don't
know anything about me.

13:35.782 --> 13:36.909
I'm done.
Get out of my head.

13:36.983 --> 13:38.975
Not worth continuing. Stop
trying to figure me out.

13:43.256 --> 13:46.021
Do you even know
anything about paper?

13:46.092 --> 13:47.390
How it's made?

13:47.460 --> 13:51.022
I saw an episode on how they
make paper on Sesame Street.

13:53.433 --> 13:54.423
Get out.

13:54.500 --> 13:57.436
I'm gonna prevent inferior men
from sullying my place of work

13:57.503 --> 13:59.995
with their weak,
passionless leadership.

14:00.473 --> 14:05.036
Do you see my hat? No? That's because
I just threw it in the ring.

14:05.978 --> 14:08.345
You guys pay for
relocation, though, right?

14:08.414 --> 14:11.475
Well, why would you need relocation
if you already live in Scranton?

14:11.718 --> 14:14.244
Well, I'd wanna move
further away, you know?

14:14.320 --> 14:16.118
Just don't want
any chance of running

14:16.189 --> 14:17.851
into my coworkers
outside the office.

14:20.093 --> 14:22.494
Can I ask why you're
leaving your current job?

14:25.598 --> 14:29.660
I'm leaving my other job
because they were all jerks.

14:29.736 --> 14:31.705
Really. You know,
all of them.

14:31.771 --> 14:34.331
You had your jerk-wads
and your jerk-offs, so...

14:35.074 --> 14:38.135
Just between the wads and the offs, I
just thought, "I gotta get out of here."

14:38.277 --> 14:40.143
Is this a bad time
to be doing this?

14:40.346 --> 14:43.248
I know
I'm having a bad time.

14:43.916 --> 14:46.909
I'm sorry. If we did
something to upset you,

14:46.986 --> 14:48.750
I'm sure it was inadvertent.

14:55.395 --> 14:56.385
Wait.

14:56.629 --> 14:59.428
Oh, why did I believe
that weirdo in the lobby?

15:00.867 --> 15:02.961
These are the nicest
people I ever met.

15:04.904 --> 15:06.497
Thank you.

15:09.175 --> 15:10.165
I'm engaged.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.208
Damn, girl.

15:15.581 --> 15:17.015
It's gorgeous, Angela.

15:17.250 --> 15:19.151
Yeah, I actually know about
nice rings, and it is gorgeous.

15:19.218 --> 15:20.242
Wow.

15:20.319 --> 15:23.517
It's a little flashy. I mean,
what am I, Naomi Judd?

15:23.956 --> 15:25.390
Tell us the
freaking story!

15:25.525 --> 15:26.993
Yeah, tell us
a story.

15:27.093 --> 15:30.894
Okay. He took me to the replica
of Monet's Japanese Bridge.

15:31.431 --> 15:34.299
And then he put this flower behind
my ear, which normally I would hate,

15:34.367 --> 15:35.892
'cause it's so
civil rights-y.

15:36.002 --> 15:38.301
Then he got down on
one knee and he said,

15:38.571 --> 15:40.472
"Will you be
a senator's wife?"

15:42.608 --> 15:44.804
He talked about himself
in the third person?

15:44.877 --> 15:48.644
Yes, Pam. Not everyone is
as informal as you and Jim.

15:48.748 --> 15:51.684
"Hey, Pam, dude, whatever.
Wanna marry me?"

15:53.219 --> 15:54.585
That's not accurate.

15:54.654 --> 15:57.419
Then I saw flashes.
So, reporters were there.

15:57.490 --> 16:00.949
They always find us.
And everyone was crying.

16:01.027 --> 16:02.325
Even his aide.

16:02.862 --> 16:04.421
Angela's engaged to a gay man.

16:06.165 --> 16:07.758
As a gay man,
I'm horrified.

16:07.867 --> 16:10.427
As a friend of
Angela's, horrified.

16:10.736 --> 16:14.434
As a lover of elegant weddings,
I'm a little excited.

16:14.974 --> 16:17.409
But overall, horrified.

16:18.411 --> 16:20.346
Andy? You all set?

16:22.348 --> 16:23.873
Okay, guys. It's time.

16:24.517 --> 16:27.282
It's pep talk time.
Tell me what I need to hear.

16:27.620 --> 16:30.089
Hmm, are you sure
this is a good idea? I...

16:30.523 --> 16:32.151
I hate to see
you disappointed.

16:32.658 --> 16:34.559
That's not what
I was hoping for.

16:34.627 --> 16:37.028
Okay, I just want someone to tell
me, "You're gonna do great."

16:39.265 --> 16:41.291
You'll do great.
Come on.

16:42.335 --> 16:44.270
You guys are my best friends.

16:49.876 --> 16:53.472
I'd be happy if Andy were boss.
He listens to my stories.

16:53.546 --> 16:56.038
And they're not all A-plus
stories, let's be honest.

16:56.115 --> 16:58.983
But you know what? He always
listens like they're A-plus.

17:01.554 --> 17:03.352
Well, some are A-plus.

17:04.957 --> 17:06.448
I think Andy
should be the boss.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.290
He's just so great.

17:08.461 --> 17:11.556
If I'm being objective,
then Darryl, of course.

17:11.897 --> 17:14.527
So, Andy, what improvements would
you make as office manager?

17:14.599 --> 17:17.468
For starters, I really think we can
streamline communication around here.

17:17.904 --> 17:20.839
Whoa. That's a very heavy
accusation to level against Toby.

17:22.008 --> 17:23.135
I wasn't accusing...

17:23.209 --> 17:24.676
Well, Toby's in charge
of human resources.

17:24.743 --> 17:26.269
That would include
communication.

17:27.079 --> 17:28.877
I think that
Toby's done a fine job.

17:29.248 --> 17:32.514
Right. I really wasn't
trying to insult anyone.

17:33.152 --> 17:34.745
I didn't think you were.

17:34.854 --> 17:36.550
I have two relationships
with Andy.

17:36.789 --> 17:38.382
I have a personal
relationship,

17:38.457 --> 17:40.016
and I have a professional
relationship.

17:40.259 --> 17:42.285
Personally, yeah,
I think he's a rat

17:42.361 --> 17:44.057
and I think he's
responsible for the demise

17:44.130 --> 17:45.564
of my relationship
with Erin.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.693
Professionally...

17:48.601 --> 17:50.536
He broke up the happiest
couple in this office.

17:50.603 --> 17:52.231
How many windows are
there in New York City?

17:52.705 --> 17:54.435
What?
Critical thinking.

17:54.507 --> 17:56.703
Common on-the-spot question
asked in an interview.

17:57.276 --> 17:59.768
Okay. Uh, let me think. Are
you counting car windows?

17:59.845 --> 18:01.814
No. How far away
is the sun?

18:02.381 --> 18:04.043
Ninety-three million miles.

18:05.017 --> 18:06.645
Is it?
Yeah.

18:07.153 --> 18:09.816
And the diameter of
the sun is 870,000 miles,

18:09.889 --> 18:11.949
which makes it 109 times
wider than the Earth

18:12.124 --> 18:14.855
and 333,000 times
heavier than the Earth.

18:14.927 --> 18:16.327
Shut up about the sun.

18:16.395 --> 18:18.830
Shut up about the sun!

18:22.702 --> 18:23.931
Okay, I'm not a doctor,

18:24.003 --> 18:26.598
but I think the medical term
for that was a spaz out.

18:27.707 --> 18:29.073
Gabe just lost it.

18:30.910 --> 18:32.936
That's the best part about
convening a tribunal.

18:33.679 --> 18:37.172
One bunal can go down, and you
still have two bunals left.

18:37.783 --> 18:38.842
Right?

18:40.419 --> 18:41.751
Andy, how'd it go?

18:41.921 --> 18:43.685
I don't want to brag, but...

18:45.257 --> 18:46.657
I did my best.

18:47.760 --> 18:48.989
Hello!

18:49.061 --> 18:50.529
I forgot something in my car.

18:53.499 --> 18:56.025
You guys are so cute. When are
you gonna get back together?

18:56.636 --> 18:58.730
Never. We're just friends.

18:58.804 --> 18:59.794
Oh!

18:59.972 --> 19:02.168
Okay, my mistake.

19:02.241 --> 19:05.734
You know, you could have any man in
this whole office with your legs.

19:06.512 --> 19:08.413
I say go for it,
if you're interested.

19:09.148 --> 19:12.915
But you're not,
so never mind.

19:22.061 --> 19:24.963
I am unhappy
with the confusing

19:25.031 --> 19:28.331
and, at times, confrontational
nature of that meeting.

19:28.401 --> 19:30.233
I wanted it to go better.

19:30.636 --> 19:32.969
I wanted it to go better!

19:34.507 --> 19:37.443
Yes, there used to be a paper
clip that would pop up and say,

19:37.510 --> 19:40.639
"Looks like you are writing a letter
or resume. Would you like help?"

19:40.713 --> 19:43.774
I believe his name
was Clippy.

19:45.317 --> 19:47.377
First of all,
I wanna thank you

19:47.453 --> 19:49.581
for your years of
patronizing our company.

19:50.423 --> 19:53.757
I've got some bad news.
We're going out of business.

19:54.260 --> 19:55.250
Saving face.

19:57.229 --> 19:58.822
Yep, yep. I understand that.

19:59.565 --> 20:01.466
Basically everything's
falling apart here.

20:01.534 --> 20:03.298
How is this on me?

20:04.203 --> 20:05.193
Hang up.

20:06.672 --> 20:08.641
Corporate needs you
to find the differences

20:08.708 --> 20:11.542
between this picture
and this picture.

20:12.445 --> 20:14.471
Intel has told us there
were at least seven.

20:15.081 --> 20:16.845
Okay. I already
see one. Give me.

20:16.982 --> 20:18.041
Okay.

20:19.185 --> 20:20.619
They're the same picture.

20:21.987 --> 20:25.924
Well, I manage my department, and I've
been doing that for several years now.

20:26.025 --> 20:29.257
And, God, I've learned a lot
of life lessons along the way.

20:29.795 --> 20:31.491
Your department's
just you, right?

20:31.564 --> 20:33.795
Yes, Jim, but I am
not easy to manage.

20:34.033 --> 20:36.298
Great. Um,
can we just...

20:37.169 --> 20:38.159
What was that?

20:38.704 --> 20:42.698
We just have a lot of serious
candidates to get through today, so...

20:43.175 --> 20:44.973
Am I not
a serious candidate?

20:46.679 --> 20:47.874
What do you
want me to say?

20:47.947 --> 20:50.007
I mean, there's a line of
qualified people out there.

20:50.082 --> 20:52.017
We have a video
CV from England.

20:52.084 --> 20:53.848
Are we all just
gonna pretend to...

20:54.553 --> 20:55.953
Okay. Um...

20:56.722 --> 20:58.156
What are your weaknesses?

20:58.224 --> 20:59.988
I don't have any,

21:05.798 --> 21:08.165
Erin, I believe you have
my resume on file.

21:08.734 --> 21:12.501
Please print out four copies on
32-pound cotton stock, bright white.

21:12.571 --> 21:13.561
No...

21:14.306 --> 21:16.275
Ivory.
Yes, sir.

21:16.342 --> 21:17.810
Who's in there now?
Kelly.

21:18.344 --> 21:19.903
For God's sake.

21:19.979 --> 21:22.574
So, Kelly, what do you think the
future holds for the paper business?

21:22.648 --> 21:24.116
Me peeing on
Gabe's corpse.

21:28.154 --> 21:29.178
I want an interview.

21:30.756 --> 21:32.315
How's the family?
Good.

21:32.391 --> 21:34.257
Good? Are they good?
Yeah.

21:35.327 --> 21:37.558
What's your daughter's
name again? Pee Pee?

21:37.630 --> 21:38.689
Peepa.

21:38.764 --> 21:39.959
Peepa. How is she?

21:40.032 --> 21:41.193
Great.
Great!

21:41.567 --> 21:43.058
Oh, that's great.

21:44.570 --> 21:46.539
We never were very good at
small talk, were we, Jim?

21:46.605 --> 21:47.595
No.
Now, listen...

21:47.673 --> 21:49.403
You're not getting
an interview, Dwight.

21:49.475 --> 21:51.910
The whole point of this
search committee process

21:51.977 --> 21:53.775
is to prevent hiring someone
like you ever again.

21:53.846 --> 21:55.178
Okay. I know why
you're saying that, Jim.

21:55.247 --> 21:56.840
I really do. But think
of it this way.

21:58.050 --> 22:00.952
The hand that reaches from the
grave to grip your throat

22:01.053 --> 22:03.215
is the strong hand
you want on the wheel.

22:03.289 --> 22:04.689
Okay. That's vivid.

22:04.757 --> 22:06.555
Now, I'm gonna make
you an offer, okay?

22:06.625 --> 22:09.686
You even do so little as
grant me an interview,

22:09.762 --> 22:13.096
I will guarantee you
your dream work life, okay?

22:13.165 --> 22:15.157
You roll in
at 10:00 a.m.

22:15.234 --> 22:17.328
to your own private
reserved parking spot,

22:17.403 --> 22:20.703
pick up your daily free coffee
from Dwight's Caffeine Corner,

22:20.773 --> 22:22.969
unlimited sex breaks
for you and Pam.

22:23.042 --> 22:25.671
Yikes. Erin will eat garbage
for your entertainment.

22:25.744 --> 22:29.078
Wow. You know how
I like taking bribes.

22:29.148 --> 22:31.447
But unfortunately, Jo also
took the job away from you

22:31.517 --> 22:33.110
because she doesn't
trust your judgment.

22:33.285 --> 22:36.050
So how would that look for
me if I recommended you?

22:37.122 --> 22:39.387
Fine, I'll do it
without you.

22:39.825 --> 22:42.317
You'll regret this.
Okay.

22:43.395 --> 22:44.920
Let me get
that for you.

22:45.631 --> 22:46.792
Thank you.
Okay.

22:49.668 --> 22:51.569
As long as you keep it moist,
it's easier to work with.

22:51.637 --> 22:53.697
And I can't just use
a tube of crescent rolls?

22:54.707 --> 22:57.677
You know what, go to McDonald's
for dinner. Why cook?

22:58.978 --> 23:00.037
Okay.

23:02.648 --> 23:04.116
Pam,

23:04.984 --> 23:06.384
I think Robert is gay.

23:06.685 --> 23:08.017
The Senator?

23:09.088 --> 23:11.319
He was married before,
and he has a kid.

23:11.390 --> 23:12.688
So...
And don't say that thing

23:12.758 --> 23:14.818
about how lots of
gay guys have kids.

23:16.161 --> 23:18.494
I have a very
strong suspicion.

23:19.732 --> 23:20.722
Did you?

23:21.200 --> 23:23.669
Oh! No.

23:24.770 --> 23:25.760
No.

23:25.871 --> 23:27.203
Did you see him
at a bathhouse?

23:27.706 --> 23:28.901
What bathhouse?

23:28.974 --> 23:31.068
The windowless building
by the Baskin Robbins.

23:32.011 --> 23:33.001
What?

23:33.145 --> 23:35.307
Forget it. I'm never gonna
know what goes on there.

23:35.681 --> 23:38.480
Name: David Brent.
Occupation: Inspirer.

23:38.617 --> 23:40.609
Status: None of your business.

23:40.886 --> 23:42.946
Young, free and single, though.
Thanks for asking.

23:43.088 --> 23:45.284
Hear you're looking
for a new boss, yeah?

23:46.025 --> 23:48.790
Someone to tell a bunch of
discontented, under-encouraged drones

23:48.861 --> 23:49.954
what to do every day.

23:50.029 --> 23:52.794
Is that it? Our out-of-touch
powers that be.

23:52.865 --> 23:55.357
Want me to fire them? They
don't see things your way?

23:55.434 --> 23:58.029
Then I ain't that dude.
Bye-bye, baby, bye-bye.

23:58.103 --> 23:59.765
Get some other corporate
suit to lay down the law.

23:59.838 --> 24:01.431
What? You've
changed your mind?

24:01.507 --> 24:03.339
You're now looking
for a leader of men?

24:03.842 --> 24:05.970
Ipso facto. Women too.

24:06.245 --> 24:07.713
When do I start?

24:07.813 --> 24:08.803
Eh?

24:11.583 --> 24:13.575
Hey.
Hi. Hey.

24:13.652 --> 24:17.145
I realized I never paid you back for that
lunch you paid for, like, a month ago.

24:17.523 --> 24:18.650
Yeah, don't worry about it.

24:18.724 --> 24:20.522
Well, it's money.

24:20.592 --> 24:24.154
I was thinking I could make dinner for you
tonight, like a Middle Eastern feast.

24:24.797 --> 24:27.392
Chicken shawarmas, shish
kebabs, pita with hummus.

24:28.267 --> 24:31.760
Well, I think I only lent you like $3.
That would be so much more trouble.

24:32.338 --> 24:34.273
Just bring the money tomorrow.
No big deal.

24:35.307 --> 24:37.071
Or else I'll break your legs.

24:37.743 --> 24:39.837
Not if I can help it.

24:45.985 --> 24:47.544
My friend at
the Scranton Blade

24:47.619 --> 24:49.315
is totally plugged
into these matters.

24:49.755 --> 24:51.246
You're in
the gay mafia.

24:51.323 --> 24:53.918
You're thinking of another group,
much wealthier, much older.

24:53.993 --> 24:55.188
You sound ignorant.

24:56.562 --> 24:58.724
You guys, um,
talking senator?

24:59.798 --> 25:00.788
No.
No.

25:00.866 --> 25:02.664
Why would we be talking
about the Senator?

25:03.068 --> 25:04.764
'Cause he's totally gay.

25:05.571 --> 25:07.301
How do I know
that Robert is gay?

25:07.706 --> 25:11.734
He "liked" my Facebook photos
at 3:00 in the morning.

25:14.279 --> 25:15.338
It was a really
good photo, though.

25:16.215 --> 25:18.912
Do you know what it took
to get Bob to notice me?

25:19.284 --> 25:21.480
I waited in his
office every morning

25:21.553 --> 25:23.044
wearing nothing
but kitty cat ears.

25:23.122 --> 25:25.114
I did that every
day for two weeks.

25:25.190 --> 25:26.522
And on the tenth day,
he walked in,

25:26.592 --> 25:28.720
he was naked too,
except a dog nose.

25:29.495 --> 25:30.758
Guess what we did then?
Bestiality.

25:30.829 --> 25:31.990
I don't think
I can do that...

25:32.564 --> 25:33.554
Yeah.

25:33.632 --> 25:34.964
That's not
my personality.

25:35.034 --> 25:37.196
If my daughter
were asking me...

25:38.437 --> 25:40.497
Yes?

25:40.572 --> 25:45.203
I would say if you want someone,
if you really want them,

25:45.677 --> 25:47.043
go get them.

25:48.714 --> 25:50.546
I do really want him.

25:51.984 --> 25:53.976
So, uh, here you go.

25:54.086 --> 25:56.317
Great.
Hope it's all right.

25:56.388 --> 25:57.378
I'm sure it's fine.

25:58.323 --> 26:00.849
The guy who was in here
earlier, interviewed after me,

26:00.959 --> 26:02.188
how'd he do?

26:02.261 --> 26:03.695
Howard Klein?
No, no, no, no.

26:03.762 --> 26:05.025
That's not who
I'm talking about.

26:05.564 --> 26:07.556
Oh. Deshawn Williams.

26:07.633 --> 26:09.192
Yes. How did he do?

26:09.268 --> 26:11.737
He's an amazing man.
He's a Rhodes Scholar.

26:11.804 --> 26:15.673
He invented an app that invents apps.
Fantastic kisser.

26:15.741 --> 26:18.142
Come on, man. I'm being serious.
Don't joke.

26:18.310 --> 26:19.471
Darryl, we all know you.

26:19.545 --> 26:22.014
Your interview is not nearly as
important as the other guy's.

26:24.950 --> 26:27.647
First I'll take down
the cubicle walls.

26:27.719 --> 26:30.018
But there aren't...
Symbol of transparency.

26:30.155 --> 26:31.714
There'd be no titles.

26:32.658 --> 26:34.092
Everyone has the same job.

26:34.626 --> 26:35.992
Same goes for me.

26:36.395 --> 26:39.832
I'll take your job,
but I'd reject the title.

26:39.898 --> 26:40.957
A little unspecific.

26:41.033 --> 26:44.435
Everyone would be known
for their accomplishments.

26:45.037 --> 26:47.233
That's very interesting. Um...

26:47.306 --> 26:49.298
I feel like there might
be a conflict there,

26:49.408 --> 26:52.207
and if a conflict did arise,
how would that be dealt with?

26:52.277 --> 26:54.075
Oh. Yeah.

26:55.280 --> 26:56.304
Hmm.

26:56.381 --> 26:58.475
Scratch everything from before.
I'll tell you what I'd do.

26:58.750 --> 27:00.048
Go the other way.

27:00.586 --> 27:02.020
More cubicles.

27:02.421 --> 27:03.548
More division.

27:04.256 --> 27:07.454
Everyone is
somebody's boss,

27:07.593 --> 27:11.052
and that person can fire
the person below them.

27:11.130 --> 27:15.761
And once a month, the
lowest-performing person...

27:17.536 --> 27:18.560
Bye-bye.

27:18.637 --> 27:21.937
How would you compare like
an accountant and HR?

27:22.007 --> 27:23.999
Well, I'll tell
you how, shall I?

27:24.076 --> 27:25.704
I'll tell you how.
Okay.

27:25.878 --> 27:28.006
By splitting the difference.

27:28.380 --> 27:30.906
Just somewhere in the middle.

27:31.049 --> 27:33.177
I think that's probably
all we need to hear from...

27:33.252 --> 27:34.276
Zen office.

27:34.820 --> 27:35.810
Hmm?

27:36.221 --> 27:38.349
Thought of that?
That's what I'd do.

27:38.857 --> 27:41.793
Everyone takes their shoes
off before they come in.

27:42.227 --> 27:45.322
Okay? There'd be no desks.
You just sit on the floor.

27:46.031 --> 27:47.329
That's very...

27:47.399 --> 27:49.391
You've got a Thai
woman out in the back...

27:49.668 --> 27:50.795
Saki.

27:51.170 --> 27:52.661
Okay.
Saki.

27:52.738 --> 27:53.967
That's not...

27:54.039 --> 27:55.735
Saki is her name, okay?

27:55.807 --> 27:58.936
She's administering massage,
all right, if you need it.

27:59.011 --> 28:01.776
If you don't, whatever. Just talk to her.
She's a person.

28:02.447 --> 28:05.007
Either way, 15 minutes
of that, and you...

28:06.018 --> 28:08.180
You are cracking to go.

28:10.088 --> 28:11.750
Office of the future.

28:13.125 --> 28:15.219
Like the inside
of a Virgin airplane.

28:15.561 --> 28:18.224
Telecommuting, all right?
Everyone's at home.

28:18.297 --> 28:21.790
The office is just a big empty space.
It's just full of screens.

28:22.801 --> 28:26.602
Sony. Sony. Everything's
just Sony, made of Sony.

28:26.672 --> 28:27.696
From Sony.

28:27.773 --> 28:29.264
I don't think that's how
telecommuting works.

28:29.341 --> 28:35.645
And then we sell tickets to tourists for
them to see the office of the future.

28:36.081 --> 28:37.845
Okay. Wow.
Cutting edge.

28:37.916 --> 28:41.182
You have to hire me.

28:41.253 --> 28:42.915
There's no ideas left.

28:43.655 --> 28:46.215
That's all the ideas there is.

28:46.491 --> 28:49.757
There's a lot more
where they came from.

28:56.468 --> 28:59.097
Jim, what can you tell us?
Is there a frontrunner?

28:59.171 --> 29:01.731
You know what? They all just sort
of blend together after a while.

29:02.541 --> 29:04.134
Well, there must be
someone who stands out.

29:04.209 --> 29:07.179
No, not at all. In fact, I'm
not even taking it seriously.

29:07.246 --> 29:09.681
I think at the end of the day, I'm
just gonna pick a name out of the hat.

29:09.748 --> 29:10.738
Well...

29:10.816 --> 29:12.512
The hell you will!

29:12.584 --> 29:15.019
I worked for the last
boss for 15 years.

29:15.087 --> 29:17.784
According to my doctor, I
don't have another 15 years

29:17.856 --> 29:21.054
if I wanna keep up the same
dietary and sexual lifestyle,

29:21.126 --> 29:22.219
which I intend to.

29:22.294 --> 29:24.661
Oh, no, Stanley.
You'll live forever.

29:24.730 --> 29:28.326
My next boss will be my last boss.
He'll be at my funeral.

29:28.400 --> 29:31.837
So I would appreciate it if you
would take this seriously.

29:34.039 --> 29:37.066
You pick a crappy boss, you're
responsible for my crappy life.

29:37.142 --> 29:39.008
Okay, everybody.
I was just making a joke.

29:39.077 --> 29:40.807
I am taking it seriously.
I promise.

29:40.879 --> 29:42.370
Are you?

29:43.882 --> 29:47.614
Little advice? Take a day off
from the whole Jim shtick.

29:47.853 --> 29:49.549
Try caring about something.

29:49.855 --> 29:52.882
You might like
how it feels, James.

29:58.630 --> 30:00.622
Gabe, honey!

30:02.067 --> 30:04.195
Oh, lord.
Take all this.

30:04.269 --> 30:05.293
All right.

30:05.370 --> 30:06.360
Here.

30:16.915 --> 30:17.905
Jim.

30:18.083 --> 30:19.346
Did you hear
Stern this morning?

30:19.418 --> 30:21.512
No. Was he good?
Uh, Robin was good.

30:21.586 --> 30:23.612
She's always good.
Keeps him on his toes.

30:23.689 --> 30:25.021
It's Howard's show, though.

30:25.390 --> 30:26.551
Whose is this?

30:27.125 --> 30:28.252
Darryl Philbin.

30:28.460 --> 30:31.589
Oh. Very nice to see
a familiar face on top.

30:32.030 --> 30:35.660
My, a little long,
aren't we? Four pages?

30:35.767 --> 30:37.030
Is this the same
Darryl Philbin

30:37.102 --> 30:39.936
who's had two jobs in
10 years at one company?

30:40.005 --> 30:45.706
Yes, thanks to you who promoted
me after we, uh, interfaced.

30:46.078 --> 30:48.741
"Coordinated and implemented
receipt, storage,

30:48.814 --> 30:52.945
"and delivery of over 2.5
billion units of inventory."

30:53.018 --> 30:56.887
2.5 billion, Darryl? 2.5
billion units of what?

30:57.656 --> 30:59.591
Paper material, ma'am.

31:00.158 --> 31:01.319
Paper material?

31:01.460 --> 31:02.450
Pieces of paper.

31:03.295 --> 31:05.025
Anybody have
a calculator?

31:08.633 --> 31:09.726
You figure what?

31:10.469 --> 31:13.598
Five hundred sheets
a ream, 24 reams a case,

31:14.172 --> 31:15.640
how long you worked here...

31:19.044 --> 31:22.037
I can see how you landed
in that ballpark.

31:22.247 --> 31:26.947
Laid end to end, it's enough to almost
stretch 60% of the way to the moon.

31:27.352 --> 31:30.584
I think this resume almost
stretches halfway to the moon.

31:31.456 --> 31:33.982
Jo, may I
speak to you for a second?

31:34.059 --> 31:35.687
Or what?
You gonna shoot me?

31:38.196 --> 31:40.597
Oh, I enjoy laughing
at my mistakes

31:40.665 --> 31:42.964
because I've learned
so much from them.

31:43.668 --> 31:45.296
I'd like to be interviewed
for the position.

31:45.370 --> 31:46.633
I'll interview you
right now.

31:46.705 --> 31:48.230
Okay.
Question one.

31:48.306 --> 31:49.797
Ever shot a gun
in the office?

31:51.810 --> 31:53.039
It's complicated.

31:53.111 --> 31:55.137
Yeah, but see, it's not.

31:57.182 --> 31:59.981
I will not give up. I won't
even be discouraged.

32:00.051 --> 32:03.749
Why? Because managing
this office is my destiny.

32:05.223 --> 32:07.419
My only potential
obstacle is

32:07.492 --> 32:11.088
if becoming manager is someone
else's destiny as well.

32:12.397 --> 32:15.026
But, hey, if this is a case
of clashing destinies,

32:15.667 --> 32:16.862
enjoy the show.

32:17.502 --> 32:18.663
I don't think
we should tell her.

32:18.770 --> 32:21.433
Angela went a whole day without
telling me I had lettuce in my teeth.

32:21.506 --> 32:22.599
Screw her.

32:22.674 --> 32:24.267
I'm a woman.
I would want to know.

32:24.342 --> 32:25.332
Yeah.
You gotta know.

32:25.410 --> 32:29.279
Okay. But if Angela can get
a gay man to marry her,

32:29.714 --> 32:32.809
maybe I could get
a lesbian to marry me. Huh?

32:33.718 --> 32:34.742
Huh? That's hot.

32:34.820 --> 32:36.618
You have met a lesbian
in real life, right?

32:37.756 --> 32:41.557
What we should warn her about is that
the whole institution of marriage

32:41.960 --> 32:43.121
is corrupt.
That's the lie.

32:43.195 --> 32:44.322
Okay, we're not
talking about that.

32:44.396 --> 32:45.659
We're not talking
about marriage.

32:45.730 --> 32:49.132
You know, this probably is
her last chance at a family.

32:50.168 --> 32:52.103
She does
seem happy.

32:52.871 --> 32:54.567
You're right.
You're right.

32:54.639 --> 32:56.835
She seems happy.
We don't tell her.

32:57.409 --> 32:58.638
- We don't tell her.
- Okay.

32:59.945 --> 33:02.210
So what else
should we gossip about?

33:02.280 --> 33:06.240
I know, like who's gonna
be the new manager, right?

33:06.318 --> 33:07.616
Will it be...

33:10.055 --> 33:12.889
Me?
Yes. Yes, it will.

33:13.325 --> 33:14.315
Yeah, right.

33:14.659 --> 33:16.355
Excuse me, Ms. Bennett,
may I have a word?

33:16.428 --> 33:17.487
Okay.

33:17.562 --> 33:18.894
Uh, can it be in private?

33:18.964 --> 33:20.728
Don't worry.
It's not about you.

33:24.503 --> 33:26.699
As minority executive,
I think it's my responsibility

33:26.771 --> 33:28.740
to let you know
that Gabe is gross.

33:28.807 --> 33:30.105
I don't think
it's professional

33:30.175 --> 33:31.404
that he was sleeping
with the receptionist,

33:31.476 --> 33:33.775
and then when Erin dumped him
so that she could be with Andy,

33:33.845 --> 33:36.713
he became a total
crazy stalker psycho.

33:36.781 --> 33:40.240
Welcome to Scranton, Jo, land of
1,000 problems only you can fix.

33:43.588 --> 33:45.454
Oh, for God's sake.

33:48.360 --> 33:51.387
He's texting me his resume
one line at a time.

33:53.064 --> 33:56.466
These are costing me 10
cents apiece, you jackass.

33:56.535 --> 33:57.525
I'm roaming!

34:00.071 --> 34:02.836
Get me our biggest client on
the phone, right this instant.

34:08.480 --> 34:10.005
Who is our
biggest client?

34:10.081 --> 34:11.481
Uh, just put him
through to me.

34:13.018 --> 34:14.007
Okay.

34:15.954 --> 34:17.752
Hello, this is the client.

34:17.822 --> 34:18.983
It's Creed.

34:19.190 --> 34:22.627
FYI. I'm starting
my own paper company.

34:22.893 --> 34:25.193
Looking to poach
some chumps. You in?

34:25.263 --> 34:26.822
Yes.

34:26.898 --> 34:29.993
Cool! Let's keep
this on the Q. T., okay?

34:30.068 --> 34:32.560
I don't want you to
be a dead mamma jamma.

34:32.637 --> 34:34.196
Great. Bye-bye.

34:39.744 --> 34:42.145
Get me our second
biggest client.

34:42.213 --> 34:43.772
This is great.
I love work.

34:46.284 --> 34:47.377
Again?

34:50.487 --> 34:51.547
Hold, please.

34:54.492 --> 34:55.585
Hello?

34:56.261 --> 34:57.285
Who is this?

34:57.362 --> 34:59.422
This is your
second biggest client.

35:00.832 --> 35:05.361
I want you to listen very carefully.
I'm gonna sing you a song.

35:18.183 --> 35:19.651
Jo, you have
one more candidate.

35:19.818 --> 35:21.946
He's a burn victim.
Huh?

35:22.854 --> 35:24.049
He's all messed up.

35:24.623 --> 35:26.251
I can tell him to
get lost if you want.

35:26.324 --> 35:27.656
No. Send him in.

35:28.927 --> 35:30.156
Who is this?

35:31.463 --> 35:33.796
I have no idea.
I know this guy.

35:40.972 --> 35:41.962
Um...

35:42.641 --> 35:46.408
Hello, Mr. Souvenier.
Mr. Jacques Souvenier?

35:46.945 --> 35:48.777
Nice to meet you.
It says here you're French?

35:49.180 --> 35:51.581
So you worked at your
last job for 15 years

35:51.650 --> 35:53.585
as assistant to
the regional manager.

35:53.652 --> 35:54.813
Assistant
regional manager.

35:54.886 --> 35:56.013
Assistant to the
regional manager.

35:56.087 --> 35:58.079
Assistant regional manager.
What is it?

35:58.156 --> 35:59.920
Assistant regional manager.

35:59.991 --> 36:01.584
That's my mistake.
Sorry about that.

36:01.660 --> 36:03.959
The last paper company you
worked for burned to the ground?

36:04.029 --> 36:07.261
And all because they wouldn't hire a
manager who lived and breathed paper.

36:07.532 --> 36:08.522
That's a travesty.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.026
I wanna talk to Dwight
Schrute for a second.

36:11.436 --> 36:12.699
I wanna ask him
a question.

36:12.771 --> 36:13.864
Get Dwight.

36:13.938 --> 36:15.839
If he isn't here
in 60 seconds...

36:17.876 --> 36:20.744
Wait, wait!
No. Stop, stop. Jo...

36:22.881 --> 36:24.281
It's me. I'm Dwight.

36:25.417 --> 36:26.407
No.

36:27.218 --> 36:28.709
No. Wait. But...

36:28.787 --> 36:30.585
I mean, you're
Dwight and then...

36:31.056 --> 36:32.251
He's the...

36:32.590 --> 36:33.580
Yeah.

36:33.825 --> 36:34.815
Oh.

36:36.695 --> 36:39.961
Very unprofessional, Jacques.
Or should I say Dwight?

36:40.732 --> 36:44.794
Let's just say I had hired this
Jacques Souvenier. Then what?

36:44.869 --> 36:46.269
I would have dressed
this way every day,

36:46.337 --> 36:47.635
legally changed my name,

36:47.706 --> 36:49.766
learned French sign
language, shown up,

36:49.841 --> 36:53.471
and been the best damn branch
manager you'd ever seen.

36:53.545 --> 36:55.480
All that for this job.
Yes.

36:57.649 --> 36:58.981
That's crazy.

37:00.719 --> 37:02.051
Get out of here.

37:05.356 --> 37:07.484
What a nut job.

37:10.261 --> 37:13.129
This guy was good. Although
he did keep saying

37:13.198 --> 37:14.928
that he needed two weeks off
right at the beginning

37:14.999 --> 37:16.729
for a trip to
the Finger Lakes.

37:16.801 --> 37:18.565
Seriously, every five
minutes he was like,

37:18.636 --> 37:20.332
"Hey, just making sure the
Finger Lakes thing is clear."

37:20.405 --> 37:24.433
Okay. It's fun to talk about the
rejects, but who's got you excited?

37:24.509 --> 37:25.841
Finger Lakes guy is good.

37:26.311 --> 37:28.109
Darryl is also very good.

37:28.646 --> 37:31.639
You know, I just wish we'd find a
candidate that knows the company

37:31.716 --> 37:34.515
as well as, say, some of the
people on this committee,

37:34.586 --> 37:36.452
you know, who've been
here for a long time.

37:36.821 --> 37:37.811
Interesting.

37:38.189 --> 37:41.455
It'd be a demotion for Gabe and
Jim's not interested, so...

37:42.627 --> 37:44.823
Are you trying to tell me
you should be manager?

37:44.896 --> 37:46.228
You pulling
a Dick Cheney?

37:46.765 --> 37:50.725
No, I'm just saying if
we can't find someone...

37:51.603 --> 37:53.071
Yeah, sure,
I could do it.

37:54.606 --> 37:57.098
You're funny.
Little Dick Cheney.

37:58.076 --> 38:00.204
You want it? Ask for it.

38:01.012 --> 38:02.708
Say you're the
best man for the job.

38:06.885 --> 38:10.879
I would work really hard, and,
I mean, you could do worse.

38:11.823 --> 38:14.315
'Cause...
For God's sake.

38:14.592 --> 38:16.720
Who's this fellow?
Went to Cornell.

38:17.395 --> 38:18.454
What's wrong with him?

38:18.530 --> 38:19.657
How much time do you have?

38:20.165 --> 38:21.724
Sales ability, none.

38:22.066 --> 38:24.001
Integrity?
See sales ability.

38:24.669 --> 38:26.968
And that's your unbiased opinion.
Yes, it is.

38:27.038 --> 38:29.940
So it's not relevant that he took
the receptionist away from you.

38:30.542 --> 38:33.478
Oh, Jo. Jo,
I'm disappointed in you.

38:33.545 --> 38:36.174
Some people let personal
things into the work...

38:36.247 --> 38:38.113
Is she with him? Because I
thought that she's just...

38:38.183 --> 38:39.913
Gabe!

38:40.819 --> 38:43.880
Back when I bought this place,
I was looking for a ghost.

38:44.422 --> 38:47.017
Somebody to flitter around,
spooking people,

38:47.091 --> 38:49.720
keeping them on their toes,
and then disappear.

38:50.028 --> 38:52.725
My girlfriend said she knew a
man who looked like a ghost,

38:52.997 --> 38:54.488
and he went to
business school.

38:55.033 --> 38:57.025
But a ghost ain't
supposed to date people.

38:57.101 --> 38:58.899
You think you're Beetlejuice?
No.

38:58.970 --> 39:01.565
I'm no Beetlejuice.
You're no good to me up here.

39:02.173 --> 39:05.439
You got all close to these people,
got involved in their lives.

39:06.177 --> 39:07.509
Let's get you
back to Florida.

39:07.946 --> 39:09.312
We'll figure out
something for you.

39:09.747 --> 39:10.908
That sounds
like a promotion.

39:10.982 --> 39:12.006
It's not.

39:12.350 --> 39:14.410
Let's get Kelly in
here to take his place.

39:14.485 --> 39:15.714
Uh, why Kelly?

39:15.920 --> 39:18.014
'Cause Gabe's tall and weak.
She's short and strong.

39:18.089 --> 39:19.284
I'm doing
an opposites thing.

39:20.525 --> 39:21.515
Okay.

39:21.759 --> 39:23.227
How'd my girl Nelly do?

39:23.294 --> 39:24.728
Oh, I didn't know
you knew her.

39:24.796 --> 39:26.424
She didn't mention it?
No.

39:26.564 --> 39:28.760
The integrity move.
I like it.

39:29.133 --> 39:32.035
Yeah, we met at some dumb
Women in Business seminar.

39:32.570 --> 39:34.903
I was the speaker, and
she was the only person there

39:34.973 --> 39:37.602
who wasn't trying to
sell some Curves ripoff.

39:38.476 --> 39:40.377
You know, she also
gave me reason to think

39:40.445 --> 39:42.277
that maybe she
wasn't a good fit.

39:42.347 --> 39:44.145
Well, I'm not saying
you must hire her.

39:44.315 --> 39:47.410
If you find someone who's
clearly a fit, then fine.

39:47.518 --> 39:49.316
Just make sure
they fit real good.

39:49.487 --> 39:52.286
No more manager turnover.
Don't mess this up, Jim.

39:53.992 --> 39:55.585
And give
Dwight an interview.

39:56.094 --> 39:58.063
I like a little bit of crazy.

40:02.300 --> 40:03.734
Erin, what are you doing?

40:03.801 --> 40:05.565
I've been turned
into a puppet.

40:05.637 --> 40:07.333
Okay.

40:07.405 --> 40:09.840
Look at the puppet.
Hi, puppet.

40:10.008 --> 40:11.032
Who are you?

40:11.309 --> 40:13.471
I was going to put
on a puppet show today

40:13.544 --> 40:17.003
to warn people about the faulty
outlet behind the fax machine.

40:18.449 --> 40:19.781
But change of plan.

40:20.451 --> 40:22.545
I went to drop off
the FedEx forms,

40:22.820 --> 40:26.723
and an evil witch named Angela
turned me into a puppet!

40:26.791 --> 40:30.284
Yeah.
Low blow, puppet.

40:30.795 --> 40:35.130
And there's only one thing that can
change me back into a real girl.

40:36.100 --> 40:37.159
It's good.

40:37.735 --> 40:41.365
It's just that I wish the puppets
would talk more about the alphabet.

40:41.906 --> 40:45.775
Not for me, but if
any kids are watching.

40:46.344 --> 40:49.143
A, B... And so forth.

40:49.647 --> 40:50.808
You know.

40:51.382 --> 40:53.977
M, N, L, O, P.

40:56.554 --> 40:57.544
F.

40:59.157 --> 41:02.127
I need the most special
thing in the office.

41:02.193 --> 41:03.183
Silence?

41:03.261 --> 41:05.526
A date with
the best salesman,

41:06.464 --> 41:08.695
Andy Bernard!

41:17.976 --> 41:19.467
Hey, Erin.

41:20.878 --> 41:22.972
Where'd you learn
how to puppet like that?

41:23.181 --> 41:25.013
I've done it all my life.
Listen, I'm really flattered,

41:25.083 --> 41:26.278
but I don't think we should.

41:32.890 --> 41:35.826
Erin's my best friend in
this office, hands down.

41:36.761 --> 41:37.888
But

41:38.429 --> 41:41.558
when she asked me out, I just
didn't have that feeling, you know?

41:41.632 --> 41:43.863
Aren't there some things
that you really want to like

41:43.935 --> 41:46.837
but you just can't
seem to like it?

41:46.904 --> 41:49.931
Like Mad Men or football.

41:50.908 --> 41:53.241
Let's not forget. Erin
chose Gabe over me.

41:53.311 --> 41:54.540
That happened.

41:55.780 --> 41:59.410
I'm not gonna apologize
for getting over her, okay?

42:00.618 --> 42:04.214
I'm sorry. I would go for
someone who's more...

42:06.424 --> 42:07.824
She's great, though.

42:14.465 --> 42:17.765
Hey, Jim. Elevator man.
Hey. Yup. All right.

42:17.835 --> 42:19.599
So, listen.

42:20.238 --> 42:24.266
I feel like I came off terribly
today, and I want to just start over.

42:24.342 --> 42:26.436
What can I do?
Should I call Jo or...

42:26.511 --> 42:28.412
Maybe have my old boss call her.
Listen, listen, listen.

42:28.479 --> 42:30.380
This isn't you, okay?

42:30.448 --> 42:34.078
The Darryl we all love,
he's calm, he's confident.

42:34.152 --> 42:36.121
So, just be that guy.
Okay.

42:36.187 --> 42:37.849
All right?
Okay, yeah.

42:37.922 --> 42:39.288
I was thinking that.
All right.

42:39.891 --> 42:41.689
Thanks. Means a lot.
Yup.

42:41.759 --> 42:42.749
Of course.

42:43.027 --> 42:46.555
Stanley, I won't be able to
invite everyone to the wedding,

42:46.631 --> 42:48.759
because we wanna
keep it to 350.

42:48.833 --> 42:50.062
I'll get over it.

42:50.168 --> 42:52.194
I mean, we just have to
see how many senators

42:52.270 --> 42:54.535
and members of Congress
want to attend

42:54.605 --> 42:57.040
before we can open it
up to regular people.

42:57.809 --> 43:00.745
Pam, you know how you and Jim
did your ironic wedding?

43:00.812 --> 43:03.714
Do you still have the plans for the
dream wedding that you couldn't afford?

43:04.282 --> 43:05.614
That was our dream wedding.

43:06.684 --> 43:07.982
Niagara Falls?

43:08.686 --> 43:10.951
Pregnant?
That was your dream?

43:11.823 --> 43:13.223
Pork medallions?

43:15.760 --> 43:19.822
I hope you have a very
beautiful wedding, Angela.

43:22.333 --> 43:25.394
So, Angela, are you looking
forward to your wedding night?

43:26.104 --> 43:29.006
What goes on in our bedroom is
none of your business, Phyllis.

43:29.373 --> 43:30.705
Or yours.

43:34.579 --> 43:38.346
Oscar, you build up these
enemies in your head

43:38.549 --> 43:40.415
and you want to
see them suffer.

43:40.952 --> 43:43.922
But the thing is,
you don't.

43:45.656 --> 43:47.181
You don't.

43:51.429 --> 43:53.193
Oh, Oscar.

43:54.565 --> 43:56.090
All right.

43:56.167 --> 43:57.795
Name.
Dwight Schrute.

43:57.869 --> 44:00.100
Thank you, Mr. Schnoot.
We will let you know.

44:00.471 --> 44:02.201
You have to interview me.
I just did.

44:02.273 --> 44:04.868
The answer to that one question
told me everything I need to know.

44:05.209 --> 44:06.370
How did I do?
To be honest,

44:06.444 --> 44:09.414
I'm leaning towards another man.
His name is Jacques Souvenier.

44:09.480 --> 44:12.143
But would you like
to be his number two?

44:12.216 --> 44:16.153
God, it's gonna be hard,
but, yeah, I would do it.

44:16.320 --> 44:17.618
Okay, well, there's a
lot to think about,

44:17.688 --> 44:19.782
so we will get back to you. No.

44:19.857 --> 44:21.086
I demand more questions.

44:21.159 --> 44:22.627
All right, guys.
Good day.

44:22.693 --> 44:24.252
A lot of candidates.
Let's discuss.

44:24.362 --> 44:26.263
Okay, if you're not gonna
interview me, then I'll do it.

44:26.330 --> 44:27.354
Yes.

44:27.999 --> 44:29.763
What will be
your first priority?

44:30.935 --> 44:33.564
I will have seven
first priorities.

44:33.638 --> 44:35.869
Safety, profits,

44:36.340 --> 44:39.674
fostering a community of
self-reliance and entrepreneurship,

44:40.111 --> 44:42.842
listening, respect
for human life,

44:43.514 --> 44:47.849
bolstering our public image, and
getting everyone home on time.

44:48.920 --> 44:50.684
Dwight, let me be frank,

44:50.821 --> 44:52.585
in an accident that
no one can blame you for,

44:52.690 --> 44:55.785
an antique gun was discharged
while you were acting manager.

44:56.093 --> 44:58.062
How are we ever
to trust you again?

45:01.699 --> 45:02.689
That's a great question.

45:04.535 --> 45:09.564
I am going to institute a strict "No
firearms" policy for this office

45:09.640 --> 45:12.109
that extends
to myself as well.

45:12.510 --> 45:15.412
Wow. All of my
concerns are disappearing.

45:15.713 --> 45:17.477
Thank you, Dwight.
Thank you.

45:21.919 --> 45:24.354
You'll be hearing from us shortly, Mr.
Schrute,

45:24.655 --> 45:27.386
and I think you're going to like
the call you're going to receive.

45:28.025 --> 45:29.516
Oh, come on.

45:31.462 --> 45:33.363
I'm just happy
that I got this meeting.

45:37.802 --> 45:38.997
Well, that was quick.

45:39.070 --> 45:42.199
Very, very
interesting.

45:42.907 --> 45:44.967
And you know what?
I'm impressed.

45:45.576 --> 45:46.805
He's not a real candidate.

45:46.877 --> 45:48.778
I don't know, Jim, 'cause it
makes me think about something

45:48.846 --> 45:50.178
that my grandfather used to say,

45:50.248 --> 45:53.241
which is that sometimes the hand
that jumps out of the grave

45:53.317 --> 45:54.842
and grabs you
around the throat,

45:54.919 --> 45:57.320
that is the hand that
you want on the wheel.

45:57.388 --> 45:59.448
You took the deal.
Yeah. It was a great deal.

45:59.523 --> 46:00.786
That's not okay.

46:00.858 --> 46:02.884
I don't know, Dwight seems
like a great leader to me,

46:02.960 --> 46:06.328
and I look forward to the personal
perks that he promised me privately.

46:06.397 --> 46:07.626
What do you think, Toby?

46:07.698 --> 46:09.291
Well, we could try him
out for a little while,

46:09.367 --> 46:13.805
and if it doesn't work out, you know,
maybe one of us could, you know, step in.

46:14.505 --> 46:16.133
What is happening
right now?

46:18.676 --> 46:21.077
Is it true that you're
making Dwight the manager?

46:21.145 --> 46:22.511
No. Why would
you think that?

46:22.580 --> 46:24.879
Well, he and Kelly said,
then they pre-fired me.

46:24.949 --> 46:25.939
Okay.

46:29.253 --> 46:31.984
Okay, guys, just so you all know,
no decision has been made.

46:32.056 --> 46:34.423
And Dwight is definitely
not the boss.

46:34.492 --> 46:37.326
That is correct actually,
Dwight is not the manager yet.

46:37.395 --> 46:39.796
No, no, no, not ever, 'cause
that's not gonna happen.

46:39.864 --> 46:41.765
Well, it's not entirely
up to you, is it?

46:41.832 --> 46:44.495
Seems to me like someone is
getting a little power mad.

46:44.568 --> 46:47.231
Am I the only one who remembers
what he did when he was in charge?

46:47.305 --> 46:48.796
I feel like I'm going
a little bit crazy.

46:48.873 --> 46:51.775
Tuna, you're completely sane.
Thank you.

46:51.976 --> 46:53.342
Who do you like
for the job?

46:53.644 --> 46:56.443
Is there anyone who maybe was a
little underwhelming at first

46:56.514 --> 47:01.179
but now seems like a safe, if not
slightly unexciting, choice?

47:01.319 --> 47:04.653
Okay. It seems like everybody
has an opinion, so who else?

47:04.722 --> 47:06.156
Anybody?
Do you mean it?

47:06.223 --> 47:08.419
Anybody? Are you sure?

47:08.492 --> 47:09.926
I suppose I am.

47:09.994 --> 47:13.522
Okay. Well, what do
I want in a manager?

47:14.131 --> 47:15.895
Let me see.

47:17.268 --> 47:19.760
What do I want?

47:20.471 --> 47:21.598
I don't think he meant...

47:21.739 --> 47:24.573
Hey, so now anyone
gets to talk at any time?

47:24.642 --> 47:25.803
Go ahead.

47:26.277 --> 47:28.872
What do I want?

47:30.748 --> 47:34.344
I'm looking for
someone who...

47:36.721 --> 47:39.156
Everyone is listening to me.

47:40.124 --> 47:41.353
- Can I say...
- Yes.

47:41.425 --> 47:42.654
I think it should be Darryl.

47:42.727 --> 47:44.093
Okay.
What a surprise.

47:44.161 --> 47:45.686
Minorities sticking together.

47:45.763 --> 47:47.129
Kelly's on your side.

47:47.198 --> 47:49.827
I'm sorry, is that all you think of me?
A minority?

47:49.900 --> 47:54.668
I am so much more than that. I am a dancer.
I'm a singer. I'm a fashion designer.

47:54.739 --> 47:57.004
Whoever it is, I think
they should be lame.

47:57.842 --> 48:01.540
Kind of a non-threatening,
moderate personality.

48:01.846 --> 48:03.576
I want an outsider.
Perfect.

48:03.647 --> 48:05.843
There are several outside candidates
that we think would be...

48:05.950 --> 48:07.213
No, I mean an outsider.

48:07.718 --> 48:09.584
Like someone on
the margins of society

48:09.653 --> 48:12.248
who doesn't see things the way
we do, like a homeless person.

48:12.390 --> 48:14.018
A homeless person. Really?

48:15.025 --> 48:16.323
A homeless person.

48:16.394 --> 48:18.022
No. You're right, Pam.
Let's just leave them

48:18.095 --> 48:19.825
to the welfare system
and let that handle it.

48:19.897 --> 48:21.798
No, I want you to
say that you think

48:21.866 --> 48:25.132
the best person to be our new
manager is a homeless person.

48:25.202 --> 48:26.568
Let me guess
who you want, Pam.

48:26.637 --> 48:29.106
Rachael Ray?
The ladies of The View?

48:29.206 --> 48:33.109
I got away with everything
under the last boss,

48:33.177 --> 48:35.078
and it wasn't
good for me at all.

48:35.146 --> 48:38.139
So I want guidance.
I want leadership.

48:38.582 --> 48:41.609
But don't just, like,
boss me around, you know?

48:41.685 --> 48:42.880
Like, lead me.

48:42.987 --> 48:48.016
Lead me when
I'm in the mood to be led.

48:48.359 --> 48:49.987
I just want, for once,

48:50.094 --> 48:53.963
a smart, professional, decisive,
well-hung man in his 40s.

48:54.031 --> 48:55.932
Hey, hey, hey!
Okay, fine.

48:56.233 --> 48:58.725
Uh, the guy with
the tiny penis.

48:58.803 --> 49:01.363
Are you happy?
Let's hire that guy!

49:01.439 --> 49:03.203
She may have a point there.

49:03.574 --> 49:05.975
Would a small penis work?

49:06.410 --> 49:08.311
Small to moderate.

49:08.379 --> 49:09.642
Gotta catch a plane.

49:10.281 --> 49:11.840
Hey, Gabe, I'm sorry.

49:11.916 --> 49:13.646
We didn't get you
a cake or anything.

49:13.717 --> 49:14.741
We're gonna miss you.

49:14.819 --> 49:17.254
Well, I'm still the corporate
liaison to the branch.

49:17.321 --> 49:20.018
You are not leaving
without giving me a hug.

49:21.325 --> 49:22.349
Ugh.

49:22.426 --> 49:24.258
Okay, you know what? You don't
need to make that sound.

49:24.328 --> 49:26.888
I'm sorry. You were just a lot bonier
than I thought you were gonna be!

49:26.964 --> 49:28.626
There are plenty of people
who love touching me.

49:29.066 --> 49:30.295
I'm a terrific hugger.

49:30.935 --> 49:31.959
I've been with
a bunch of girls

49:32.036 --> 49:33.766
where that's basically
all they wanna do.

49:34.271 --> 49:35.671
I will see you all soon.
Later, man.

49:35.739 --> 49:36.900
We'll miss you.
Good luck.

49:36.974 --> 49:38.237
Good luck
at your new job.

49:38.309 --> 49:39.572
- Take care, man.
- Gonna miss you, Gabe.

49:39.643 --> 49:42.340
Listen up.
Listen up, ladies.

49:43.614 --> 49:44.912
I want the job.

49:46.150 --> 49:47.482
There. I said it.

49:48.085 --> 49:51.112
I'm educated, I'm capable,
I like all of you,

49:51.288 --> 49:54.156
and I won't
make any changes.

49:54.959 --> 49:56.086
I see it.

49:56.627 --> 50:01.065
I see it like I see a mountain that I'm
standing in front of and facing and I'm liking.

50:01.398 --> 50:02.422
Yeah. Yeah.

50:02.500 --> 50:04.662
Andy would be
wonderful as boss.

50:04.835 --> 50:06.167
Erin made a good point.

50:07.271 --> 50:10.070
No. We're not related.
I got the call.

50:11.709 --> 50:13.439
But I'll tell her
some other day.

50:14.812 --> 50:16.178
Okay, what's going on?

50:16.647 --> 50:19.173
I thought I told you guys
to expand the company.

50:19.517 --> 50:23.454
It looks exactly the same.
I'm very disappointed.

50:24.021 --> 50:25.956
Jordana, get me
Jo on the phone.

50:29.760 --> 50:31.456
Okay, nobody say anything.

50:38.335 --> 50:41.430
Hey, Creed, this is Jo.
No, don't say another word.

50:41.505 --> 50:44.998
I need you to take
a nap right now. Yes.

50:45.743 --> 50:49.544
I want to talk to you in your dream.
Lay down and put the phone...

50:50.347 --> 50:54.978
Great. Very good. Okay,
you gonna go to sleep.

50:55.653 --> 50:56.985
Okay, I think we have
about 40 minutes.

50:57.855 --> 50:58.845
What about Darryl?

50:59.823 --> 51:01.951
We can all agree that
he's a standup guy, right?

51:02.026 --> 51:05.224
Very nice, laid back.
Overall, just a good guy.

51:05.296 --> 51:08.164
What if he brings some of those
warehouse types up here?

51:08.232 --> 51:09.598
They're not carnies.

51:09.800 --> 51:10.995
Can we see
a birth certificate?

51:11.068 --> 51:13.663
I mean, how do we know he wasn't
born in Mubajuba or something?

51:13.737 --> 51:15.035
What difference
would that make?

51:15.105 --> 51:18.371
I'm just saying American
jobs should go to Americans.

51:20.644 --> 51:23.409
Meredith, you can't
just spit in the office.

51:24.348 --> 51:25.680
Okay, I went too far.

51:26.517 --> 51:27.507
Angela.

51:27.685 --> 51:30.018
Well, let me be clear.
I only speak for myself,

51:30.087 --> 51:32.113
and not myself
and the Senator.

51:32.323 --> 51:34.519
I think we have some
wonderful candidates,

51:34.592 --> 51:36.891
and there is a great
lively debate here.

51:37.027 --> 51:38.723
But let's think about...
No. No.

51:38.796 --> 51:41.391
No. Sorry. We cut Kevin
off for the same thing.

51:41.465 --> 51:43.593
You have to have something
to say if you talk.

51:43.667 --> 51:44.828
Exactly.

51:44.902 --> 51:46.837
Jada. No, no, no.
Jada, what are you...

51:47.838 --> 51:49.807
Oh. So sorry, guys.

51:49.873 --> 51:52.342
I hope my family didn't
disrupt your meeting.

51:52.610 --> 51:56.047
Daddy, are these the people
who are making you manager?

51:56.113 --> 51:58.207
Maybe, sweetheart.

51:58.282 --> 52:00.308
Single dad. Challenges.

52:01.185 --> 52:03.450
I don't know if
he'd be a good manager,

52:03.520 --> 52:04.954
but he's
a really great dad.

52:05.055 --> 52:07.581
Okay. This was
a mistake. Let's go.

52:08.559 --> 52:11.529
It seems like we all know enough to vote.
Should we just vote now?

52:11.595 --> 52:12.824
What? No, no, no.
It's not a vote.

52:12.896 --> 52:14.956
Then what was this all about?
I don't know.

52:15.032 --> 52:16.898
This conversation
really got away from me.

52:16.967 --> 52:18.492
I don't care.
They can just vote.

52:18.569 --> 52:19.867
No, they can't.

52:19.970 --> 52:21.700
That's not how
this is gonna work.

52:22.239 --> 52:24.765
We're going in this room.
We're gonna have a meeting.

52:24.842 --> 52:26.174
We're gonna make
a recommendation to Jo,

52:26.243 --> 52:29.213
and she's gonna give you her
recommendation on Monday, okay?

52:29.580 --> 52:31.014
What the hell
happened out there?

52:35.586 --> 52:38.522
Sometimes you hear people
talking about failing upwards.

52:39.923 --> 52:41.323
I think I'm about to do that.

52:42.459 --> 52:44.621
This job?
Oh, yeah, I'll get it.

52:45.429 --> 52:46.897
Jo's an old friend.

52:47.398 --> 52:50.163
I think
I'm her best friend.

52:50.534 --> 52:51.900
She's not
my best friend.

52:52.236 --> 52:54.068
Every day, I have
a blueberry muffin.

52:54.371 --> 52:56.567
Today I did not have
a blueberry muffin.

52:57.508 --> 52:59.067
Should have had
the blueberry muffin.

52:59.443 --> 53:02.811
Especially considering how
incredibly superstitious I am.

53:03.347 --> 53:05.213
No. I've never been more
sure of anything in my life.

53:05.883 --> 53:07.875
I will be
the new boss of...

53:09.753 --> 53:11.244
Vance Refrigeration.

53:12.589 --> 53:15.354
Honestly, I think
I sabotaged myself.

53:15.459 --> 53:17.724
It's like I'm
afraid of being happy.

53:18.762 --> 53:20.060
Case in point,

53:21.031 --> 53:23.193
I was supposed to
start another job today.

53:23.467 --> 53:25.231
I will get offered the job.

53:26.036 --> 53:29.029
That's a call I've
received many times.

53:29.106 --> 53:33.202
The slight hopefulness in their
voice, the pregnant pause

53:33.277 --> 53:36.338
while they wait
to hear my response.

53:36.647 --> 53:39.583
And then my response.

53:41.151 --> 53:43.484
I want the job.
I really do.

53:43.721 --> 53:46.486
It's just the rest of my family's
in the Finger Lakes right now.

53:46.724 --> 53:49.159
I'm supposed to be in the
Finger Lakes right now.

53:49.693 --> 53:53.095
I told them I was on a hike,
snuck away to do this interview.

53:53.597 --> 53:55.566
I gotta get back pretty soon.
They'll worry.

53:55.866 --> 53:57.926
People disappear
in the Finger Lakes.

53:58.569 --> 54:03.701
I will run this branch or
I will destroy this branch.

54:05.442 --> 54:09.004
Or, I don't know. Something
always works out.

54:14.184 --> 54:17.814
You remind me so much
of my fourth biggest client.

54:17.888 --> 54:19.254
Is that right?

54:19.323 --> 54:20.552
I think
you two should meet.

54:20.858 --> 54:21.848
Well, okay...

54:21.925 --> 54:25.828
Hey, Jordana, patch my ninth and
my fourth biggest client together.

54:30.200 --> 54:31.259
Hello?

54:31.401 --> 54:32.460
Hello!

54:32.736 --> 54:34.068
Hi, how are you?

54:34.204 --> 54:35.536
Oh, I'm good!

54:35.606 --> 54:39.043
Don't you just love paper
and things about paper?

54:39.676 --> 54:41.076
Hey, are you single?

54:41.145 --> 54:43.011
This seems like
a love connection to me!

54:43.080 --> 54:44.104
It's kismet.

54:44.581 --> 54:46.743
Personally, I think
Darryl would be good.

54:46.884 --> 54:50.377
It has to be Darryl,
or someone I don't know.

54:50.921 --> 54:52.150
I thought the woman
who came in,

54:52.222 --> 54:54.123
she seemed like
she had a fun energy.

54:54.191 --> 54:57.559
I'm not a sexist. I just really
don't want it to be a woman.

54:58.529 --> 55:02.125
I just feel that women are
generally less competent than men

55:02.199 --> 55:03.861
and less rational.

55:03.934 --> 55:05.732
Again, I'm not a sexist.

55:06.303 --> 55:10.968
Even Andy...
They need to pick someone.

55:11.942 --> 55:14.468
Just someone. Fast.
