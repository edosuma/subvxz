00:02.794 --> 00:04.421
ANNOUNCER 1: <i>Remain seated, please.</i>

00:04.504 --> 00:06.840
(in Spanish)
<i>Please remain seated.</i>

00:07.424 --> 00:09.426
(lively music)

00:11.594 --> 00:12.679
(elephants trumpeting)

00:18.977 --> 00:20.228
MAN 1: <i>The love of liberty.</i>

00:20.478 --> 00:21.688
(moans)

00:21.771 --> 00:23.106
(screams)

00:31.573 --> 00:34.325
NARRATOR:
<i>Years of research and development.</i>

00:34.409 --> 00:36.703
MAN 2: T-minus ten, nine...

00:36.786 --> 00:40.373
NARRATOR:
<i>An unprecedented mobilization of manpower.</i>

00:40.457 --> 00:42.125
MAN 2: ...eight, seven...

00:42.208 --> 00:46.755
NARRATOR: <i>A fortune spent on
never-before-seen cutting-edge technology.</i>

00:46.838 --> 00:47.756
MAN 2: ...six...

00:47.839 --> 00:50.675
NARRATOR: <i>Culminating
in an historic Florida launch that</i>

00:50.759 --> 00:53.053
<i>would change the world forever.</i>

00:53.136 --> 00:54.429
(firecrackers crackle)

00:54.512 --> 00:58.808
NARRATOR: <i>Launch trajectory
set for Space Mountain.</i>

00:58.892 --> 01:03.438
MAN 2: ...five, four, three, two, one.

01:05.899 --> 01:08.109
NARRATOR:
<i>Part of a majestic mountain range</i>

01:08.193 --> 01:11.613
<i>that spans the globe
with five glorious peaks.</i>

01:11.696 --> 01:12.906
(speaking Japanese)

01:12.989 --> 01:15.283
NARRATOR:
<i>But the story of this iconic attraction</i>

01:15.366 --> 01:17.452
<i>has more ups and downs
than a roller coa...</i>

01:17.535 --> 01:20.330
It's not a roller coaster.
It's a thrill ride.

01:20.413 --> 01:21.372
NARRATOR: <i>Of course.</i>

01:21.456 --> 01:24.125
<i>Because Space Mountain isn't just
a roller coaster,</i>

01:24.209 --> 01:25.085
<i>even though it does have...</i>

01:25.168 --> 01:26.419
-Dips...
-Turns...

01:26.503 --> 01:30.465
NARRATOR: <i>It's, shall we say,
out of this world, both metaphorically...</i>

01:30.548 --> 01:31.841
-(screaming)
-(shrieks)

01:31.925 --> 01:33.760
<i>...and in its very concept.</i>

01:34.177 --> 01:36.262
You are flying through space.

01:36.763 --> 01:38.014
Hold on tight.

01:38.098 --> 01:39.390
It's like nothing else you've ever seen.

01:39.474 --> 01:41.476
NARRATOR: <i>Well, yeah.
Of course, because...</i>

01:41.559 --> 01:42.811
It's mostly in the dark.

01:42.894 --> 01:46.648
NARRATOR: <i>Well, let us shed some light
on the story of Space Mountain,</i>

01:46.731 --> 01:48.441
<i>which kind of begins in the future.</i>

01:48.942 --> 01:52.237
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:52.320 --> 01:56.783
here is your host, Walt Disney.

01:56.866 --> 01:58.743
When Disneyland opened in 1955,

01:58.827 --> 02:01.412
one of the keystone lands
was Tomorrowland.

02:01.496 --> 02:04.332
NICHOLAS: <i>All about the future,
all about going to space.</i>

02:04.415 --> 02:06.835
Walt really liked the idea of space
and Tomorrowland.

02:06.918 --> 02:08.670
(echoing)
<i>Tomorrowland. Tomorrowland.</i>

02:08.753 --> 02:10.380
NARRATOR: <i>And with good reason.</i>

02:10.463 --> 02:15.051
<i>In the 1950s, the limitless,
cavernous void of space</i>

02:15.135 --> 02:17.512
<i>represented the next great frontier.</i>

02:17.595 --> 02:19.514
Many of the things
that seem impossible now

02:19.806 --> 02:21.558
will become realities tomorrow.

02:21.641 --> 02:24.519
NARRATOR:
<i>Well, keeping in mind that in 1955,</i>

02:24.602 --> 02:30.859
<i>VHS was still about 20 years away,
progress was, you know, progressing.</i>

02:30.942 --> 02:33.945
<i>And even back during
the planning stages of Disneyland...</i>

02:34.028 --> 02:38.741
Walt Disney felt very capable
of describing Frontierland, Adventureland,

02:38.825 --> 02:40.785
<i>and especially Fantasyland.</i>

02:41.578 --> 02:44.330
But Tomorrowland is a very curious idea.

02:44.706 --> 02:47.125
NARRATOR:
<i>Curious. But for Walt and the Imagineers,</i>

02:47.208 --> 02:49.627
<i>a better word might have been...
confusing.</i>

02:49.711 --> 02:53.089
This is one of the very first drawings
of Tomorrowland.

02:53.173 --> 02:55.133
But we didn't know much about tomorrow.

02:55.216 --> 02:56.384
NARRATOR: <i>Well, why would you?</i>

02:56.467 --> 03:00.680
<i>Because when your view of the future
is bursting with endless possibilities...</i>

03:00.763 --> 03:01.723
Just a dream away.

03:01.806 --> 03:05.185
<i>...those endless possibilities can start
to get a little...</i>

03:05.268 --> 03:06.102
Curious.

03:06.186 --> 03:08.771
NARRATOR: <i>That's one word for it,
because soon enough,</i>

03:08.855 --> 03:14.694
<i>Walt and his Imagineers found themselves
unclear on Tomorrowland's... future.</i>

03:14.777 --> 03:17.697
There was so much discussion
and conjecture...

03:17.780 --> 03:20.158
I did this. It's not very good.

03:20.241 --> 03:22.493
...that it was the last land
to be developed.

03:22.577 --> 03:26.122
NARRATOR: <i>With crucial time lost
in the curious confusion,</i>

03:26.206 --> 03:29.751
<i>when the original version of Tomorrowland
was finally finished...</i>

03:29.834 --> 03:33.755
The result was we had only
a very few attractions.

03:33.838 --> 03:36.591
NARRATOR: <i>Including such classics
as Rocket to the Moon...</i>

03:36.674 --> 03:38.509
Now, are you blasting off very shortly?

03:38.593 --> 03:40.136
Uh, just a few seconds, I'd say.

03:40.220 --> 03:44.098
<i>...and, of course, the timeless Autopia.
But beyond that...</i>

03:44.182 --> 03:48.519
Tomorrowland was more of a place
that showcased a lot of new technology.

03:48.603 --> 03:52.398
NARRATOR: <i>Ah, yes.
Who could forget the Hall of Chemistry?</i>

03:52.482 --> 03:55.693
<i>Um, anyone? Or, well, how about...</i>

03:55.777 --> 03:59.614
The Bathroom of the Future.
If you can picture that.

03:59.697 --> 04:00.698
I'm sorry I missed that.

04:00.782 --> 04:02.825
NARRATOR: <i>Well, you never want
to miss the toilet.</i>

04:02.909 --> 04:04.661
<i>-So, take a look for yourself.</i>
-(toilet flushes)

04:04.744 --> 04:07.205
Walt wanted all that out,
you know, quickly.

04:07.288 --> 04:11.209
So, it wasn't too long before we were
working on the newer Tomorrowland.

04:11.292 --> 04:15.546
NARRATOR: <i>So, in 1959, just four years
after Disneyland opened,</i>

04:15.630 --> 04:19.676
<i>the Imagineers were flushed
with new top-tier attractions</i>

04:19.759 --> 04:22.553
<i>for Tomorrowland,
like The Submarine Voyage,</i>

04:22.637 --> 04:26.557
<i>complete with real live mermaids,
as well as the Monorail,</i>

04:26.641 --> 04:32.230
<i>complete with real live passengers.
But also, in the great expansion of 1959,</i>

04:32.313 --> 04:35.692
<i>Walt, almost single-handedly
from the looks of it,</i>

04:35.775 --> 04:38.569
<i>built Disneyland's
very first roller coaster.</i>

04:38.653 --> 04:40.863
You can't say roller coaster. Thrill ride.

04:40.947 --> 04:43.533
NARRATOR: <i>Well, that thrill ride
is none other than...</i>

04:43.616 --> 04:47.120
-(horn toots)
<i>-the Matterhorn Bobsleds, of course.</i>

04:47.578 --> 04:49.038
(screaming)

04:49.122 --> 04:52.125
That was the world's first
tubular steel thrill ride.

04:52.208 --> 04:56.254
NARRATOR: <i>And going totally tubular
was quite the advantage for Disney,</i>

04:56.337 --> 04:59.424
<i>because while those traditional
flat track roller coasters...</i>

05:00.174 --> 05:01.759
<i>We can call those ones
roller coasters, right?</i>

05:01.843 --> 05:02.719
(riders scream)

05:02.802 --> 05:05.805
<i>...had their own particular brand
of thrills and spills...</i>

05:05.888 --> 05:08.433
With tubular steel,
you're able to have really sharp turns,

05:08.516 --> 05:10.643
<i>like going through a mountain
and going through caves.</i>

05:10.727 --> 05:12.270
Nobody had ever seen anything like it.

05:12.353 --> 05:13.688
NARRATOR: <i>But once they had,</i>

05:13.771 --> 05:16.983
<i>park guests agreed
the Matterhorn Bobsleds were...</i>

05:17.066 --> 05:17.942
Hello. Hi, dear.

05:18.026 --> 05:19.235
<i>...peak entertainment.</i>

05:19.319 --> 05:22.530
NARRATOR: <i>And so, with Matterhorn
mania sweeping the park,</i>

05:22.613 --> 05:25.992
<i>Walt was looking to create
some space for his next idea.</i>

05:26.075 --> 05:29.037
Walt said, "You know, it would be great
if we could take a ride

05:29.120 --> 05:31.205
like the Matterhorn
and use a space theme."

05:31.289 --> 05:33.750
NARRATOR:
<i>And so, they set out to do just that.</i>

05:33.833 --> 05:37.378
Walt and team had an idea
to do a space port within Tomorrowland,

05:37.462 --> 05:40.256
<i>and the feature anchor attraction
would be...</i>

05:40.340 --> 05:41.341
NARRATOR: <i>Space Mountain?</i>

05:41.424 --> 05:44.177
-Space Voyage.
-NARRATOR: <i>Space Voyage, huh?</i>

05:44.260 --> 05:48.056
<i>Well, this so-called Voyage
was inspired by the Matterhorn,</i>

05:48.139 --> 05:51.309
<i>but this would be far more advanced
and twice as big.</i>

05:51.392 --> 05:54.103
<i>Not as the real Matterhorn, obviously.</i>

05:54.187 --> 05:56.689
The original inception,
there were four tracks.

05:56.773 --> 05:58.900
Separately weaving in and out
through each other,

05:58.983 --> 06:00.443
through this very large mountain.

06:00.526 --> 06:02.653
And it went out of the mountain,
just like Matterhorn.

06:02.737 --> 06:04.572
Basically, four roller coasters in one.

06:04.655 --> 06:06.908
NARRATOR: <i>And if that doesn't sound
advanced enough...</i>

06:06.991 --> 06:08.326
It's operated by a computer.

06:08.409 --> 06:11.412
And the idea that an amusement park
would have a ride

06:11.496 --> 06:14.707
that would use
that kind of technology was a big deal.

06:14.791 --> 06:17.835
NARRATOR:
<i>Maybe even too big of a deal, because...</i>

06:17.919 --> 06:22.173
At the time, the technology
wasn't advanced enough to even build it.

06:22.256 --> 06:24.842
NARRATOR: <i>After all,
computers in the early '60s were...</i>

06:25.343 --> 06:28.137
<i>uh, computers in the early '60s.</i>

06:28.221 --> 06:30.890
So, the project was put on hold.

06:30.973 --> 06:33.976
NARRATOR: <i>And keeping true to the theme
of Tomorrowland...</i>

06:34.060 --> 06:37.647
A step into the future with predictions
of constructive things to come.

06:37.730 --> 06:40.983
<i>...Walt and the Imagineers knew
that these clunky old things</i>

06:41.067 --> 06:42.610
<i>would catch up eventually.</i>

06:42.693 --> 06:46.948
NARRATOR: <i>Because if you look at
a Disneyland map from 1968, you'll see...</i>

06:47.031 --> 06:49.409
NICHOLAS: <i>A thing that looks like
Space Mountain saying "Future Attraction."</i>

06:49.492 --> 06:52.161
And you don't know what it is,
when it's coming, but...

06:52.245 --> 06:55.748
NARRATOR: <i>But Disney had recently come
into ownership of...</i>

06:55.832 --> 06:58.126
-Forty-three square miles.
<i>-Which is...</i>

06:58.209 --> 07:01.170
Twice the size of the island of Manhattan.

07:01.254 --> 07:03.423
<i>...for their East Coast Disney Resort.</i>

07:03.756 --> 07:08.136
<i>And with so much manpower
going into Walt Disney World in Florida,</i>

07:08.219 --> 07:11.305
<i>it didn't bode well
for Walt's tubular steel</i>

07:11.389 --> 07:13.933
<i>passion project to the stars. In fact...</i>

07:14.016 --> 07:16.602
That project, unfortunately, was shelved.

07:16.686 --> 07:20.064
<i>And just like that, the thrill ride
of tomorrow was a thing of the...</i>

07:20.398 --> 07:22.191
<i>past. But then...</i>

07:22.275 --> 07:25.778
1971, Walt Disney World opens,
Magic Kingdom opens.

07:25.862 --> 07:27.738
That was a major milestone
for the company.

07:27.822 --> 07:30.032
NARRATOR: <i>It was also a major success.</i>

07:30.116 --> 07:32.034
There are so many people that want to go

07:32.118 --> 07:33.828
to the Magic Kingdom,
they close the gates.

07:33.911 --> 07:37.582
There's a line of cars
leading out from the parking kiosk

07:37.665 --> 07:40.543
simply waiting for people to leave
so they can park their car.

07:40.626 --> 07:43.004
NARRATOR:
<i>But by the early '70s, Disney's parking</i>

07:43.087 --> 07:45.131
<i>wasn't the only thing that was stacked.</i>

07:45.214 --> 07:47.967
The theme park business
was kind of a thing at that point.

07:48.050 --> 07:50.511
NICHOLAS: <i>There were other competitors
that were building parks,</i>

07:50.595 --> 07:52.597
and at that time,
guests were looking for things

07:52.680 --> 07:54.807
that were a little more exciting
and real-feeling.

07:54.891 --> 07:55.766
NARRATOR: <i>Such as...</i>

07:55.850 --> 07:59.312
-JOE: <i>Two spectacular upside-down loops.</i>
-NARRATOR: <i>Or even...</i>

07:59.395 --> 08:00.688
JOE: <i>The highest drop in the world.</i>

08:00.771 --> 08:04.150
NARRATOR: <i>But because the Matterhorn
was so good, you could say</i>

08:04.233 --> 08:08.613
<i>it was kind of Walt who ramped up this
steel tube arms race in the first place.</i>

08:08.696 --> 08:10.406
Of course, the Matterhorn had existed.

08:10.490 --> 08:11.365
(riders scream)

08:11.449 --> 08:13.534
And that really set the stage
for theme parks worldwide

08:13.618 --> 08:15.828
<i>at that point that tubular steel
was the way to go.</i>

08:15.912 --> 08:18.331
NICHOLAS: <i>And in the '60s and '70s,
other companies thought,</i>

08:18.414 --> 08:21.125
<i>"We want a piece of that pie.
We want to do that, too."</i>

08:21.209 --> 08:22.543
So, it sort of takes off.

08:22.627 --> 08:24.045
(screaming)

08:24.128 --> 08:25.296
And it starts to diversify.

08:25.379 --> 08:26.756
Hey, let's try this one.

08:26.839 --> 08:30.843
And it continued to grow
at increasing rates of speed.

08:30.927 --> 08:33.638
NARRATOR: <i>Well, clearly,
Disney was in pole position with...</i>

08:33.721 --> 08:34.847
Well, the Matterhorn.

08:34.931 --> 08:37.350
NARRATOR: <i>Exactly, but Florida
wouldn't be getting one of those.</i>

08:37.433 --> 08:39.560
-Well...
-NARRATOR: <i>You know, no snow.</i>

08:39.644 --> 08:41.103
Uh, yeah.

08:41.604 --> 08:45.191
NARRATOR: <i>Uh, no. But Walt Disney World
wouldn't be doing the same old thing.</i>

08:45.274 --> 08:48.361
<i>Uh, actually,
quite a few of the same things.</i>

08:48.444 --> 08:50.321
And who doesn't want to fly
in an elephant?

08:50.404 --> 08:52.031
NARRATOR: <i>Teenagers, actually.</i>

08:52.114 --> 08:53.449
<i>But they'd be getting something</i>

08:53.533 --> 08:55.952
<i>that even they couldn't turn
their noses up at.</i>

08:56.035 --> 08:58.162
Florida was the new park,
and they wanted to do

08:58.246 --> 09:00.081
something... really special.

09:00.164 --> 09:03.209
NARRATOR: <i>Something stellar.
Something out of this world.</i>

09:03.292 --> 09:05.086
<i>-Something like...</i>
-Space Voyage.

09:05.169 --> 09:07.630
NARRATOR: <i>Which, just before Walt
put it on pause...</i>

09:07.713 --> 09:09.966
<i>Oh, yeah, VHS exists now.</i>

09:10.049 --> 09:12.593
<i>Anyway, the attraction had been renamed...</i>

09:12.677 --> 09:13.594
Space Mountain.

09:13.678 --> 09:15.805
NARRATOR: <i>Which made sense,
seeing as this whole thing</i>

09:15.888 --> 09:17.723
<i>-started with this one...</i>
-MAN 3: Hello.

09:17.807 --> 09:18.933
-MAN 4: Hi, dear.
-NARRATOR: <i>Yep, hi.</i>

09:19.016 --> 09:21.143
So, they decided to build
Space Mountain...

09:21.227 --> 09:22.645
-NARRATOR: <i>Not in Anaheim.</i>
-...In Florida.

09:22.728 --> 09:25.815
NARRATOR: <i>And why not?
The conceptual work had already been done.</i>

09:25.898 --> 09:30.987
<i>But more importantly, by the early '70s,
these old clunkers had finally caught up</i>

09:31.070 --> 09:32.488
<i>with Walt's original vision.</i>

09:32.572 --> 09:36.367
<i>So, what exactly would these computers
be controlling?</i>

09:36.450 --> 09:37.493
A block system.

09:37.577 --> 09:38.911
(beeping)

09:38.995 --> 09:42.123
NARRATOR:
<i>That does not compute. Please elaborate.</i>

09:42.206 --> 09:44.584
Block systems,
which are basically just brakes

09:44.667 --> 09:47.086
throughout the ride,
allow multiple cars to run

09:47.169 --> 09:49.046
<i>on the track at the same time safely.</i>

09:49.130 --> 09:52.049
NICHOLAS: <i>If one were to catch up
to another, it would slow down or stop it,</i>

09:52.133 --> 09:53.759
so it doesn't run into the other ones.

09:53.843 --> 09:56.637
NARRATOR: <i>Although, block systems
weren't a new thing, mind you.</i>

09:56.721 --> 10:01.183
<i>The Matterhorn had been running on one
since '59, minus the computer control.</i>

10:01.267 --> 10:04.478
But Space Mountain
was extremely elaborate for its time

10:04.562 --> 10:07.815
<i>because it has a lot more zones
and brake areas.</i>

10:07.898 --> 10:09.025
NARRATOR: <i>And, in addition to that...</i>

10:09.108 --> 10:10.818
-Disney wanted high capacity.
-NARRATOR: <i>Meaning?</i>

10:10.901 --> 10:14.447
To be able to put more guests
on the ride at one time.

10:14.530 --> 10:18.367
NARRATOR: <i>A longer track with more cars
on it at the same time</i>

10:18.451 --> 10:22.163
<i>was way more than those old-fashioned
block systems could handle.</i>

10:22.246 --> 10:24.957
So because we had
the computer-controlled system...

10:25.041 --> 10:25.916
(beeping)

10:26.000 --> 10:29.128
...we can get a lot more rockets
and a lot more people through the ride.

10:29.211 --> 10:31.839
NARRATOR: <i>And good thing, too,
because it was looking like</i>

10:31.922 --> 10:34.717
<i>there'd be a little bit less ride
than originally planned.</i>

10:34.800 --> 10:37.386
In the original inception,
there were four tracks.

10:37.470 --> 10:40.598
NARRATOR: <i>But the only scaling
on this mountain would be back.</i>

10:40.681 --> 10:42.224
What we ended up with was two.

10:42.308 --> 10:44.435
NARRATOR:
<i>Which was still quite cool. After all...</i>

10:44.518 --> 10:46.354
-It's essentially the Matterhorn.
-(honks)

10:46.437 --> 10:48.522
But inside a fully-enclosed mountain.

10:48.606 --> 10:52.318
-NARRATOR: <i>And what a mountain it is.</i>
-It's just a cool-looking thing.

10:52.401 --> 10:54.737
NARRATOR: <i>Surely one of the most iconic...</i>

10:54.820 --> 10:55.946
You know, you want
a little sculpture of it.

10:56.030 --> 11:00.034
<i>...imaginative Disney Park designs
ever committed to paper.</i>

11:00.117 --> 11:03.371
NARRATOR: <i>Before being thrown out.
And committed to paper again.</i>

11:03.454 --> 11:05.247
<i>Then, eventually built.</i>

11:05.331 --> 11:08.250
-In Florida.
-NARRATOR: <i>A conical dome that, in fact,</i>

11:08.334 --> 11:13.297
<i>sprung from the mind of legendary
Disney Imagineer John Hench.</i>

11:13.381 --> 11:15.841
I think I made the first little sketches
on the thing.

11:15.925 --> 11:17.635
NARRATOR: <i>"Little sketches on the thing."</i>

11:17.718 --> 11:20.429
He designed Space Mountain
before the technology was available.

11:20.513 --> 11:23.015
BO: <i>You know, he was just a man
that was ahead of his time.</i>

11:23.099 --> 11:24.183
He could read any language

11:24.266 --> 11:28.729
<i>and he could talk technology
and knew color like nobody else.</i>

11:28.813 --> 11:32.733
That's why Walt would refer to him
as his expert at everything,

11:32.817 --> 11:34.151
because he knew a lot.

11:34.235 --> 11:37.238
NARRATOR: <i>And that universal know-how
would come in handy</i>

11:37.321 --> 11:39.573
<i>when designing this modern monolith.</i>

11:39.657 --> 11:43.411
I thought I would have to invent
a new kind of... architecture.

11:43.661 --> 11:45.371
NARRATOR: <i>So, he kind of did.</i>

11:45.454 --> 11:49.208
<i>And with an unparalleled knack
for artistry and spectacle,</i>

11:49.291 --> 11:52.962
<i>John Hench whipped Space Mountain
into shape. A cone shape.</i>

11:53.045 --> 11:58.008
The cone is a logical way
of dispersing the energy

11:58.092 --> 12:01.220
that is represented by lifting a car

12:01.637 --> 12:05.433
<i>to a certain height
and letting it run out by gravity.</i>

12:05.516 --> 12:08.269
(echoing)
<i>Gravity. Gravity. In a spiral.</i>

12:09.687 --> 12:10.938
(sniffs)

12:11.021 --> 12:13.983
NARRATOR: <i>And Magic Kingdom guests
would soon grasp the...</i>

12:14.066 --> 12:16.026
-(echoing) <i>Gravity. Gravity.
-...of their situation.</i>

12:16.110 --> 12:19.613
NARRATOR: <i>Because on January 15, 1975,</i>

12:19.697 --> 12:24.118
<i>Space Mountain opened its airlock
in Florida for the very first time.</i>

12:24.201 --> 12:28.372
They had a huge celebration,
and they called in some NASA astronauts.

12:28.456 --> 12:29.790
And it was a big occasion

12:29.874 --> 12:33.169
because this was the first significant
expansion to occur at the Magic Kingdom

12:33.252 --> 12:35.337
<i>since the park had opened,</i>

12:35.421 --> 12:36.714
and it really kind of set it
on a trajectory

12:36.839 --> 12:39.592
<i>that was the beginnings
of what became the park we know today.</i>

12:39.675 --> 12:44.054
NARRATOR: <i>Now, speaking of trajectories,
well, guests were being launched on one.</i>

12:44.138 --> 12:47.641
<i>It was unlike any theme park
attraction ever ridden.</i>

12:47.725 --> 12:50.311
You, basically, are dropped into darkness.

12:50.394 --> 12:52.980
(upbeat music)

12:53.063 --> 12:56.442
It really does give you a sense of like
you're flying through outer space.

12:56.525 --> 12:58.277
There's no more lights,
there's only stars.

12:59.445 --> 13:03.866
It feels like you're going super fast
because you can't see where you're going.

13:06.118 --> 13:08.579
And you don't know which way is left
and which way is right.

13:08.662 --> 13:11.415
Is that a drop or is that a hill?
You don't know what's going to happen.

13:11.499 --> 13:15.127
NARRATOR: <i>Which is exactly what guests
found so thrilling.</i>

13:15.211 --> 13:17.505
<i>And even a little... chilling.</i>

13:17.588 --> 13:21.175
I followed the first ride
and waited for it when they disembarked.

13:21.759 --> 13:25.095
One woman struggled out
and knelt down and kissed the carpet.

13:25.221 --> 13:27.056
(laughs)

13:27.139 --> 13:29.183
NARRATOR:
<i>But Magic Kingdom was puckering up, too,</i>

13:29.266 --> 13:31.227
<i>because with Space Mountain taking off,</i>

13:31.310 --> 13:34.688
<i>Walt Disney World was kissing
its thrill ride blues goodbye.</i>

13:34.772 --> 13:36.941
Space Mountain was extremely popular
in Disney World.

13:37.024 --> 13:38.818
NARRATOR: <i>Disney was on a roll, and soon,</i>

13:38.901 --> 13:42.363
<i>they were ready to take the Space Mountain
launch sequence to the next stage.</i>

13:42.446 --> 13:44.281
NICHOLAS:
<i>They wanted to bring it to Disneyland.</i>

13:44.365 --> 13:48.035
NARRATOR: <i>And finally,
the dream of raising those spacey spires</i>

13:48.118 --> 13:51.997
<i>above the Anaheim skyline
would come to fruition. But...</i>

13:52.081 --> 13:55.376
There wasn't as much room
in Disneyland in California.

13:55.459 --> 13:59.129
NARRATOR: <i>In fact, the Magic Kingdom
at Walt Disney World in Florida</i>

13:59.213 --> 14:02.716
<i>has dozens of acres
on Disneyland in California.</i>

14:02.800 --> 14:04.969
<i>But that wouldn't make their plans
go supernova.</i>

14:05.052 --> 14:06.804
<i>The solution was simple.</i>

14:06.887 --> 14:09.932
A smaller mountain. The one in Florida
was 300 feet in diameter.

14:10.015 --> 14:12.226
LUC: <i>The one in Anaheim
was 200 feet in diameter.</i>

14:12.309 --> 14:15.312
NARRATOR: <i>That's a lot of track
to squeeze into a third less dome.</i>

14:15.396 --> 14:20.276
Walt Disney World has two tracks running
similar but opposite of each other.

14:20.359 --> 14:23.070
NARRATOR: <i>Luckily, Imagineers
have a one-track mind</i>

14:23.153 --> 14:26.031
<i>for problem-solving,
'cause two tracks weren't going to fit.</i>

14:26.115 --> 14:29.869
So, they found a way to develop
their own single-track version.

14:29.952 --> 14:32.371
NARRATOR:
<i>But half the track meant half the cars,</i>

14:32.454 --> 14:36.834
<i>and half the cars meant
half the park guests kissing the carpet.</i>

14:36.917 --> 14:38.544
(laughs)

14:38.627 --> 14:41.463
But it has just as many guests on it
because the trains are bigger.

14:41.547 --> 14:44.300
NARRATOR: <i>Which meant
Space Mountain Anaheim would be...</i>

14:44.383 --> 14:46.218
Just as thrilling, just as exciting.

14:46.552 --> 14:50.055
NARRATOR: <i>However, as thrilled
and excited Disneyland guests</i>

14:50.139 --> 14:54.476
<i>boarded Space Mountain
for the first time in mid-1977,</i>

14:54.560 --> 14:58.439
<i>around that same time,
secret talks were underway...</i>

14:58.522 --> 15:00.774
It took about five years of negotiation.

15:00.858 --> 15:04.695
<i>...the likes of which would change
the Walt Disney Company forever.</i>

15:04.778 --> 15:06.614
But then in 1979,

15:06.697 --> 15:10.367
we signed an agreement
to create Disneyland.

15:10.451 --> 15:12.369
-NARRATOR: <i>Uh... Thank you.</i>
-Tokyo.

15:12.453 --> 15:16.707
NARRATOR: <i>Tokyo Disneyland
opened in April of 1983.</i>

15:17.082 --> 15:21.462
<i>And being the first Magic Kingdom-style
Disney Park in over a decade,</i>

15:21.545 --> 15:23.839
<i>Tokyo Disneyland would be a showcase</i>

15:23.923 --> 15:27.384
<i>for Imagineering's newest
state-of-the-art innovations.</i>

15:27.468 --> 15:29.303
It was a creative relationship.

15:29.386 --> 15:31.597
We brought everything we
could possibly bring to it.

15:31.680 --> 15:35.517
NARRATOR: <i>So, when opening day guests
lined up for Tokyo Space Mountain...</i>

15:35.601 --> 15:37.019
(in Japanese)

15:37.102 --> 15:40.105
<i>...it would be revealed
just how Disney had updated</i>

15:40.189 --> 15:44.026
<i>this iconic ride
for a new culture and a new decade.</i>

15:44.109 --> 15:47.655
Tokyo Space Mountain is a carbon copy
of Anaheim Space Mountain.

15:47.738 --> 15:50.366
NARRATOR:
<i>Well, you can improve on perfection.</i>

15:50.449 --> 15:52.242
The track layout
and everything's the same.

15:52.326 --> 15:53.702
NARRATOR: <i>Because, as it turns out...</i>

15:53.786 --> 15:56.121
ANNOUNCER 2: <i>The Japanese wanted
an American experience.</i>

15:56.205 --> 15:57.247
NARRATOR: <i>So...</i>

15:57.331 --> 16:01.335
Tokyo Disneyland took the greatest hits
of Disneyland and the Magic Kingdom

16:01.418 --> 16:03.128
at Walt Disney World,
and brought them together.

16:03.212 --> 16:05.130
-NARRATOR: <i>Which ended up...</i>
-ANNOUNCER 2: <i>Saving Disney the effort</i>

16:05.214 --> 16:07.257
<i>of designing a new theme park
from scratch.</i>

16:07.341 --> 16:09.843
NARRATOR:
<i>Which is exactly what they'd be doing</i>

16:09.927 --> 16:11.971
<i>on their next international park.</i>

16:13.973 --> 16:18.185
<i>Rocketing ahead to the late '80s,
the new guard of Disney leadership</i>

16:18.268 --> 16:22.481
<i>was buoyed with confidence
after the success of Tokyo Disneyland.</i>

16:22.564 --> 16:26.276
<i>So, they began carving
a new and ambitious course.</i>

16:26.360 --> 16:27.486
And they wanted to go to Europe.

16:27.569 --> 16:30.614
NARRATOR: <i>Specifically,
just outside of Paris, France.</i>

16:30.698 --> 16:32.992
Welcome to Walt Disney Company.

16:33.075 --> 16:36.245
NARRATOR: <i>And assigned to oversee
this gargantuan project,</i>

16:36.328 --> 16:38.497
<i>Imagineering legend Tony Baxter.</i>

16:38.580 --> 16:41.750
One of the most exciting things
I got involved with in my career

16:41.834 --> 16:44.878
was getting the assignment
to bring a Disneyland to the Parisians.

16:44.962 --> 16:48.757
NARRATOR: <i>And Imagineer Tim Delaney
was equally excited about the plan,</i>

16:48.841 --> 16:50.926
<i>although clearly too cool to show it.</i>

16:51.010 --> 16:54.054
And I went to Tony and I say,
"Sign me up." And he's like, "You're on."

16:54.138 --> 16:57.057
NARRATOR: <i>But this dream team
would have their work cut out for them,</i>

16:57.141 --> 16:59.601
<i>because unlike Tokyo Disneyland, where...</i>

16:59.685 --> 17:01.979
ANNOUNCER 2: <i>The Japanese wanted
an American experience.</i>

17:02.146 --> 17:04.273
NARRATOR: <i>...what was known at the time
as Euro Disney</i>

17:04.356 --> 17:08.027
<i>would have to cater
to the sophisticated tastes of the French.</i>

17:08.110 --> 17:09.445
And everyone was aware of,

17:09.528 --> 17:13.449
"How do we make this park
more European-like?"

17:13.532 --> 17:17.494
NARRATOR: <i>But before Tony and Tim
could envision a French Space Mountain,</i>

17:17.578 --> 17:21.582
<i>they'd have to consider the corner
of the park in which it would reside.</i>

17:21.665 --> 17:24.126
So, now we get to Tomorrowland,
and the scary thing

17:24.209 --> 17:28.797
<i>was most of the futures that we showed
in Disneyland and Walt Disney World</i>

17:28.881 --> 17:30.340
are American futures.

17:30.424 --> 17:33.886
NARRATOR: <i>Which would make Tomorrowland
problematic in France.</i>

17:33.969 --> 17:37.347
There was a consideration one time
of not having a Tomorrowland at all.

17:37.431 --> 17:39.975
NARRATOR: <i>What? No Space Mountain?
That's crazy talk.</i>

17:40.059 --> 17:42.603
So, the idea,
because we were going to France,

17:42.686 --> 17:48.650
was that let's create a land that is more
dedicated to great visionaries.

17:48.734 --> 17:50.569
TIM: <i>Jules Verne. HG Wells.</i>

17:50.652 --> 17:52.404
Even Leonardo da Vinci.

17:52.488 --> 17:55.365
And the idea was that each one
of those visionaries

17:55.449 --> 17:56.950
had their vision of the future,

17:57.034 --> 17:59.703
so this became now
a history of the future.

17:59.787 --> 18:02.831
NARRATOR: <i>And with Tony and Tim's vision
of a shared history,</i>

18:02.915 --> 18:06.585
<i>France's Tomorrowland
became Discoveryland.</i>

18:06.668 --> 18:09.922
<i>But as the costs began piling up,
Tim's discovery</i>

18:10.005 --> 18:12.091
<i>was that compromises
would have to be made.</i>

18:12.174 --> 18:14.676
There was a gentleman
who was running our project

18:14.760 --> 18:16.970
from a construction management
point of view.

18:17.054 --> 18:19.848
He just said, "Look, Tim, the studio
just wants you to put

18:19.932 --> 18:21.517
another Space Mountain in there
and be done with it."

18:21.600 --> 18:23.727
NARRATOR: <i>As in,
just like the one in Orlando.</i>

18:23.811 --> 18:25.896
<i>And Anaheim. And Tokyo.</i>

18:25.979 --> 18:29.316
No. We can't do that.
We've got to do something different.

18:29.399 --> 18:32.820
NARRATOR: <i>But doing something different
meant Space Mountain would be pushed</i>

18:32.903 --> 18:35.614
<i>to Euro Disney's Phase Two of development.</i>

18:35.697 --> 18:38.242
This was gonna be, you know,
the next big thing

18:38.325 --> 18:39.868
that we did after the park opened.

18:39.952 --> 18:42.955
NARRATOR: <i>So, Tim got to work designing,
while Euro Disney</i>

18:43.038 --> 18:44.748
<i>got on with the business of opening.</i>

18:45.332 --> 18:50.546
(in French)
Euro Disneyland is officially open.

18:51.130 --> 18:52.631
(people cheer)

18:52.714 --> 18:56.260
NARRATOR: <i>And, with that out of the way,
time for Tim to show off his work.</i>

18:56.677 --> 18:59.721
TIM: <i>I started doing a whole series
of renderings.</i>

19:00.264 --> 19:03.934
A bronze, brass-covered
Jules Vernian Space Mountain.

19:04.017 --> 19:07.771
NARRATOR: <i>Prominently featuring
what appeared to be a giant cannon.</i>

19:07.855 --> 19:11.066
That cannon comes
from the Jules Verne story,

19:11.150 --> 19:13.068
TRACY: <i>From the Earth to the Moon.</i>

19:13.152 --> 19:17.197
<i>He dreamed of using things like cannons</i>

19:17.281 --> 19:20.325
<i>for something peaceful rather than war.</i>

19:20.409 --> 19:25.789
And so, in our story, you're in the 1800s
and being shot to the moon

19:25.873 --> 19:28.750
-in a cannonball.
-NARRATOR: <i>Sounds like a ball.</i>

19:28.834 --> 19:31.253
<i>But what makes that different
from the other Space Mountains?</i>

19:31.336 --> 19:32.421
I said, "Why don't we..."

19:32.504 --> 19:34.923
-(gunshot)
-"Shooting, going to the moon."

19:35.007 --> 19:35.883
(grunts)

19:35.966 --> 19:37.718
A catapult launch system

19:37.801 --> 19:41.555
is the most exhilarating effect
you can have.

19:41.847 --> 19:45.434
TIM: <i>Like acceleration in a car.
It's extraordinary.</i>

19:45.517 --> 19:48.562
So, like, why not just do this
and shoot it up the hill

19:48.645 --> 19:50.189
and let it just drop into the mountain.

19:50.272 --> 19:52.774
NARRATOR:
<i>A higher-caliber attraction, to be sure.</i>

19:52.858 --> 19:55.319
The cannon was a massive, animated prop.

19:55.402 --> 19:57.696
It was so complex. It was so big.

19:57.779 --> 19:58.655
(creaking)

19:58.739 --> 20:01.909
TIM: <i>There were these gears that turn,
you see the train go in...</i>

20:02.492 --> 20:03.827
(hisses)

20:03.911 --> 20:06.121
TIM: <i>You shoot it out,
there's a big steam...</i>

20:06.205 --> 20:09.208
It was probably
the largest asset that we've had

20:09.291 --> 20:11.793
connected to an exterior
of a ride building, ever.

20:11.877 --> 20:13.420
NARRATOR: <i>And that's just the launch.</i>

20:13.503 --> 20:16.298
<i>There's stuff that happens
once you get inside, too.</i>

20:16.381 --> 20:19.635
The ride goes twice as fast
as any other Space Mountain.

20:19.718 --> 20:22.429
We introduced the first loops
for a Disney Park.

20:22.512 --> 20:26.308
NARRATOR: <i>And, as if that wasn't enough
to have park guests head over heels,</i>

20:26.391 --> 20:28.518
<i>this next Disney Park first would be...</i>

20:28.602 --> 20:32.022
It's the first onboard audio
that was ever done on a roller coaster,

20:32.105 --> 20:36.235
where you've got to sync the soundtrack
without spoiling the tempo of the music.

20:36.443 --> 20:40.364
TONY: <i>And the poor composer had to ride it
a million times to get those beats</i>

20:40.447 --> 20:41.907
just right as you go through.

20:41.990 --> 20:46.286
We arrived at the first parking point.
The music was still going.

20:46.370 --> 20:47.663
It was like a slight delay there.

20:47.746 --> 20:51.583
All right, get in. We will ride it again.
It's exhausting.

20:51.667 --> 20:54.044
NARRATOR: <i>But there was no time
for sleeping on the job,</i>

20:54.127 --> 20:57.047
<i>because Space Mountain's
most important launch yet</i>

20:57.130 --> 21:00.217
<i>was scheduled for June 1st, 1995.</i>

21:00.300 --> 21:04.054
Disneyland Paris launches its
latest attraction, Space Mountain.

21:04.137 --> 21:06.682
...be the most stunning thrill ride
ever created.

21:06.765 --> 21:08.809
NARRATOR:
<i>It seemed to be going over well on TV.</i>

21:08.892 --> 21:10.269
...the ride of a lifetime.

21:10.352 --> 21:12.396
NARRATOR: <i>But of course,
it would be the park guests</i>

21:12.479 --> 21:15.190
<i>who'd decide if Space Mountain
was a smash.</i>

21:15.274 --> 21:19.278
<i>-And aside from one awkward thud...</i>
-(thuds)

21:20.112 --> 21:22.990
<i>...a smash is exactly what they got.</i>

21:23.073 --> 21:24.241
The ride delivered.

21:24.324 --> 21:28.870
I had never seen so many happy people...
in my life.

21:28.954 --> 21:30.455
(people cheer)

21:30.539 --> 21:34.584
It re-launched the park.
I mean, the attendance went... took off.

21:34.668 --> 21:35.669
(whooshes)

21:35.752 --> 21:38.630
Taking Verne's trip from Earth to Moon

21:38.714 --> 21:43.051
<i>and being exploded out of the cannon
up into this world of outer space,</i>

21:43.135 --> 21:45.804
-that just grabbed all of Europe.
-Stupendo!

21:45.887 --> 21:47.306
All these people coming off the ride,

21:47.389 --> 21:50.267
and this one Italian woman came off,
and she was like...

21:50.350 --> 21:51.476
(mumbles)

21:51.560 --> 21:54.146
It was great.
I have no idea what she said.

21:54.479 --> 21:56.565
But in fact,
you knew exactly what she said.

21:56.648 --> 21:57.691
(shrieks)

21:57.774 --> 22:00.152
Well, it sounds absolutely incredible.

22:00.235 --> 22:01.778
NARRATOR: <i>But things were about to sound</i>

22:01.862 --> 22:04.865
<i>even more incredible,
because back in Anaheim,</i>

22:04.948 --> 22:08.410
<i>that in-seat onboard soundtrack
developed for Paris</i>

22:08.493 --> 22:11.455
<i>sounded like a good idea
to the Californian crew...</i>

22:11.538 --> 22:13.790
That's when they brought
in the first onboard audio.

22:13.874 --> 22:16.084
<i>...who, in 1996, went down to the beach</i>

22:16.168 --> 22:19.212
<i>and brought in
pioneer surf rock guitarist...</i>

22:19.296 --> 22:21.256
Dick Dale, surf rock tunes.

22:21.340 --> 22:24.801
<i>...who strummed a fusion
of science fiction and surf music</i>

22:24.885 --> 22:26.470
<i>into this iconic riff.</i>

22:26.553 --> 22:28.555
(upbeat music)

22:32.351 --> 22:34.311
Actually, it's really cool.
I'm kind of bummed

22:34.394 --> 22:35.854
that I never got to experience it.

22:35.937 --> 22:38.315
NARRATOR: <i>And the reason for that is,
nine years later,</i>

22:38.398 --> 22:40.859
<i>with the mature Space Mountain
showing its age,</i>

22:40.942 --> 22:43.570
<i>the attraction underwent a major overhaul</i>

22:43.653 --> 22:47.074
<i>in celebration of Disneyland's
50th anniversary.</i>

22:47.157 --> 22:50.202
<i>So, an updated attraction
would need updated music.</i>

22:50.285 --> 22:53.705
They brought in the composer
who did, like, The Incredibles.

22:55.290 --> 22:58.085
ALISON: <i>Michael Giacchino,
he did an updated score.</i>

22:58.168 --> 22:59.294
That's what's there now.

22:59.378 --> 23:03.090
NARRATOR: <i>And, as well as this arguably
more iconic music track,</i>

23:03.632 --> 23:06.802
<i>Space Mountain got...
yet another new track.</i>

23:08.053 --> 23:11.264
<i>Like, the track.
Meaning, the old one had to come out.</i>

23:11.348 --> 23:12.974
It's like a ship in a bottle.

23:13.058 --> 23:15.185
OWEN: <i>Parts by parts,
they have to get the track out.</i>

23:15.268 --> 23:18.688
It was just dirt, and I was like,
"Wow. This is amazing."

23:18.772 --> 23:22.234
All that... that track and all that
spaghetti goes into this, but...

23:22.317 --> 23:23.652
NARRATOR: <i>Don't worry, because...</i>

23:23.735 --> 23:27.030
They recreated the track
exactly as it was originally.

23:27.114 --> 23:28.657
NARRATOR: <i>And, with Hong Kong Disneyland</i>

23:28.740 --> 23:32.577
<i>under construction at the same time,
why not recreate it twice?</i>

23:32.661 --> 23:37.749
Hong Kong's Space Mountain is a...
identical track to the one in Anaheim.

23:37.999 --> 23:39.668
NARRATOR: <i>But this refurbishment</i>

23:39.751 --> 23:42.421
<i>wasn't just an excuse
for Anaheim Space Mountain</i>

23:42.504 --> 23:44.172
<i>to clone itself all around the world.</i>

23:44.256 --> 23:46.675
<i>There was still refurbishing to do.</i>

23:46.758 --> 23:50.262
<i>Like the space probe
above the loading area. Most would say...</i>

23:50.345 --> 23:51.680
It's a fantastic design,

23:51.763 --> 23:55.434
but my job was to embellish it
with some details

23:55.517 --> 23:58.645
to make it much more
up to date. Some propellant tanks.

23:58.728 --> 23:59.938
(hisses)

24:00.021 --> 24:01.982
-Emphasize the boosters.
-(dings)

24:02.065 --> 24:04.776
The attachment gantry
that's holding the... the probe up.

24:05.610 --> 24:07.696
NARRATOR:
<i>But Owen was just getting started.</i>

24:07.779 --> 24:12.075
One of the biggest tasks that I had
was coming up with the Space Station 77.

24:12.159 --> 24:16.538
That was this imaginary space station
that we are teleported to,

24:16.621 --> 24:19.040
to go on our journey
through outer space from.

24:19.124 --> 24:20.333
NARRATOR: <i>And in a kind of ode</i>

24:20.417 --> 24:22.794
<i>to Space Mountain's
Tomorrowland heritage...</i>

24:22.878 --> 24:24.963
I've designed it so that
you have all these other

24:25.046 --> 24:26.423
<i>ships flying in and out of it.</i>

24:26.506 --> 24:29.342
OWEN: <i>You saw the Space Mountain vehicles
that are flying out of it,</i>

24:29.426 --> 24:31.887
<i>as well as the X2 rocket
from Mission: Space</i>

24:31.970 --> 24:34.931
So, then it was kind of
this space port, airport hub.

24:35.015 --> 24:38.643
NARRATOR: <i>And to unveil the updated
Space Mountain, none other than...</i>

24:38.727 --> 24:41.021
-Mr. Neil Armstrong.
-(crowd cheer)

24:41.104 --> 24:45.025
And I congratulate
the entire Disney organization.

24:45.108 --> 24:48.028
NARRATOR: <i>A joyous occasion
which may very well have been</i>

24:48.111 --> 24:50.405
<i>the most exciting day of his life.</i>

24:50.489 --> 24:54.951
<i>That's one small step for man,
one giant leap for mankind.</i>

24:55.035 --> 24:57.454
<i>Or maybe the second most exciting.</i>

24:57.537 --> 24:59.831
<i>And if you're wondering
what happened to the old track...</i>

24:59.915 --> 25:03.168
This is a part of the actual track
of Space Mountain.

25:03.251 --> 25:04.961
It's a pencil holder or...
or a paperweight.

25:05.045 --> 25:06.505
(chuckles)
But it's kind of neat to...

25:06.588 --> 25:10.675
to own a piece of history that I didn't
know that I'd be so involved with.

25:10.967 --> 25:12.260
So, it means a lot to me.

25:12.969 --> 25:15.889
NARRATOR:
<i>And Space Mountain means a lot to us all,</i>

25:15.972 --> 25:19.643
<i>be it the original in Florida,
the classic in Anaheim,</i>

25:19.726 --> 25:22.604
<i>as well as Tokyo, Hong Kong or Paris.</i>

25:22.687 --> 25:26.066
There wasn't something like Space Mountain
before Space Mountain,

25:26.441 --> 25:28.818
and so, I think that...
that's what makes these things iconic.

25:28.902 --> 25:31.821
NARRATOR: <i>But this iconic attraction
isn't above getting dressed up</i>

25:31.905 --> 25:34.366
<i>every so often just to keep things fresh.</i>

25:34.449 --> 25:36.618
LUC: <i>Ghost Galaxy,
which started in Hong Kong,</i>

25:36.701 --> 25:39.079
<i>is really kind of a chance
to do a Halloween overlay</i>

25:39.162 --> 25:40.080
<i>for Space Mountain.</i>

25:40.455 --> 25:42.290
(people screaming)

25:42.707 --> 25:45.919
And then that became, later on,
what we could use to make,

25:46.002 --> 25:47.254
Hyperspace Mountain.

25:47.337 --> 25:48.922
(action music)

25:49.005 --> 25:50.382
LUC: <i>The Star Wars overlay is fantastic.</i>

25:50.465 --> 25:52.050
<i>It's fun.
I mean, it puts you in the world,</i>

25:52.133 --> 25:54.427
and then, you know,
that overlay can stay on for a while,

25:54.511 --> 25:57.180
then you go back to, you know,
classic Space Mountain,

25:57.264 --> 25:58.640
and on to something else.

25:58.723 --> 26:00.517
NARRATOR:
<i>Which got the Imagineers thinking.</i>

26:00.600 --> 26:04.980
<i>After almost 40 years,
just how far could they push the idea</i>

26:05.063 --> 26:06.106
<i>of Space Mountain?</i>

26:06.189 --> 26:09.150
We said, "Why should we repeat
the thing we've already done,

26:09.234 --> 26:10.402
no matter how great it is?"

26:10.485 --> 26:12.195
We wanted to do something
a little different.

26:12.279 --> 26:13.863
NARRATOR:
<i>And they were about to get their chance,</i>

26:13.947 --> 26:17.534
<i>because when they broke ground
on Shanghai Disneyland,</i>

26:17.617 --> 26:21.121
<i>this time, they weren't going to wait
till after opening day</i>

26:21.204 --> 26:22.872
<i>to get their own Space Mountain.</i>

26:22.956 --> 26:24.291
We had the budget for Space Mountain.

26:24.374 --> 26:26.585
-We had the time for Space Mountain.
-NARRATOR: <i>But...</i>

26:26.668 --> 26:30.839
Our goal was to create something
that was authentically Disney...

26:30.922 --> 26:35.969
<i>-Well, Space Mountain is certainly that.</i>
-...and distinctly Chinese.

26:36.052 --> 26:37.512
NARRATOR: <i>Hmm. Maybe.</i>

26:37.596 --> 26:43.768
In a world of high-tech architecture
and fast trains and incredible airports...

26:43.852 --> 26:46.563
NARRATOR:
<i>Space Mountain could fit right in, right?</i>

26:46.646 --> 26:49.149
It didn't relate to the Chinese at all.

26:49.232 --> 26:51.401
NARRATOR: <i>After all,
Shanghai's maglev train,</i>

26:51.484 --> 26:52.986
<i>the fastest train in the world,</i>

26:53.069 --> 26:56.656
<i>moves at almost 270 miles per hour.</i>

26:57.282 --> 27:00.619
<i>And Space Mountain?
Well, Space Mountain's not that fast.</i>

27:01.202 --> 27:03.246
Shanghai already
is the city of the future.

27:03.330 --> 27:06.333
Which posed a problem,
not just for Space Mountain,

27:06.416 --> 27:08.001
but for Tomorrowland itself.

27:08.084 --> 27:13.256
It was all founded around these big
technological breakthroughs in the 1950s,

27:13.465 --> 27:16.009
<i>and the major one being going to space.</i>

27:16.092 --> 27:20.680
And the future was about going beyond
our planet and seeing what was out there.

27:20.764 --> 27:23.933
NARRATOR:
<i>Well, going to space? China's done that.</i>

27:24.100 --> 27:26.561
Space travel has lost some of the magic...

27:27.854 --> 27:28.855
<i>some of the unknown.</i>

27:28.938 --> 27:32.484
NARRATOR: <i>And, for what's it worth,
they even kinda had mountains covered.</i>

27:32.567 --> 27:35.320
So, we had to invent,
"What is our storyline?"

27:35.403 --> 27:39.115
What was the ride experience
for Shanghai's Tomorrowland?

27:39.199 --> 27:41.785
NARRATOR: <i>With an almost blank slate,
you might say...</i>

27:41.868 --> 27:45.455
Shanghai's Tomorrowland could be
a celebration of possibilities.

27:45.538 --> 27:49.751
NARRATOR: <i>And so, work began
on a promising, optimistic Tomorrowland.</i>

27:49.834 --> 27:51.252
<i>Now, what to fill it with?</i>

27:51.336 --> 27:54.464
How we were gonna tap into the optimism
of the Chinese audience...

27:54.547 --> 27:56.758
NARRATOR: <i>Well, having some
awesome attractions might help,</i>

27:56.841 --> 28:01.179
<i>of which Space Mountain is definitely one.
So, the Imagineers got to work,</i>

28:01.262 --> 28:05.392
<i>optimistically optimizing Space Mountain
for the Chinese audience.</i>

28:05.475 --> 28:07.352
We put all these ideas on the table.

28:07.477 --> 28:10.271
NARRATOR: <i>Scouring their minds
and digging deep.</i>

28:10.355 --> 28:13.858
SCOT: <i>What was the ride experience
for Shanghai's Tomorrowland?</i>

28:14.442 --> 28:17.320
NARRATOR: <i>Clearly, the answer
couldn't be found in 1977.</i>

28:17.404 --> 28:19.864
<i>They couldn't go that far back
in the past.</i>

28:19.948 --> 28:24.202
<i>So instead, they drew inspiration
from something far newer...</i>

28:24.285 --> 28:26.788
-Tron.
-Where did you hear that name?

28:26.871 --> 28:28.081
Well, that's your name, isn't it?

28:28.164 --> 28:32.043
NARRATOR: <i>Well, it's from the '80s,
at least. Cutting edge in its day.</i>

28:32.127 --> 28:34.421
<i>You know, perhaps with a little bit
of updating, you could...</i>

28:34.504 --> 28:36.214
In development was a new Tron film.

28:36.297 --> 28:37.382
NARRATOR: <i>Oh! Phew!</i>

28:37.465 --> 28:38.383
Nice.

28:38.466 --> 28:42.637
And we saw early concept art for it,
and it was gorgeous.

28:42.721 --> 28:45.724
Everyone saw the excitement
of doing something new and unique.

28:45.807 --> 28:48.435
NARRATOR: <i>And instead of guests
zipping about on rockets...</i>

28:48.518 --> 28:49.728
Well, it's gotta be a Lightcycle.

28:50.603 --> 28:53.022
(rattling)

28:55.150 --> 28:56.359
NARRATOR: <i>Of course, it does.</i>

28:56.443 --> 28:58.027
(whooshing)

28:58.111 --> 29:00.572
SCOT: <i>The Lightcycles
were such an iconic vehicle,</i>

29:00.655 --> 29:04.075
and I felt that those lived up
to every other iconic vehicle

29:04.159 --> 29:05.785
<i>that we have in all of our parks.</i>

29:05.869 --> 29:07.871
NARRATOR:
<i>Well, certainly a little faster than some.</i>

29:07.954 --> 29:09.581
And I wanted to bring that to life.

29:09.664 --> 29:13.334
NARRATOR: <i>Please do.
But there's just one little problem.</i>

29:14.085 --> 29:15.420
(screams)

29:15.503 --> 29:16.463
The one vehicle.

29:16.546 --> 29:19.924
NARRATOR: <i>Uh... Yeah, there's only room
for one on a Lightcycle.</i>

29:20.008 --> 29:21.634
So only a fraction
of the guests of the park

29:21.718 --> 29:24.012
would be able to experience it
throughout the course of a day.

29:24.095 --> 29:27.348
NARRATOR: <i>And so, similar to how
their predecessors maximized capacity</i>

29:27.432 --> 29:30.518
<i>while altering Florida Space Mountain
for Anaheim...</i>

29:30.602 --> 29:34.147
We needed to kind of configure
the Lightcycles in a train

29:34.230 --> 29:35.899
<i>so that we had so many people</i>

29:35.982 --> 29:39.569
<i>kind of boarding at one time.
And each coach has two Lightcycles,</i>

29:39.652 --> 29:42.238
<i>so you could ride right next
to your family or friend.</i>

29:42.322 --> 29:45.200
It's great in that everyone
gets to board their own Lightcycle,

29:45.283 --> 29:48.286
but then they're all linked together
for the common experience.

29:48.369 --> 29:51.039
It's a very different
ride system configuration,

29:51.122 --> 29:53.333
the vehicle and the way you...
you sit in it.

29:53.416 --> 29:56.169
NARRATOR: <i>But don't worry, it's not just
a matter of hanging on tight.</i>

29:56.252 --> 30:00.298
We found a restraint
that put people face forward,

30:00.590 --> 30:02.926
<i>holding on to these grips
like a motorcycle.</i>

30:03.009 --> 30:05.637
NARRATOR: <i>And like in Paris,
it's all about the launch.</i>

30:05.720 --> 30:08.139
Space Mountain uses a...
a traditional lift hill.

30:08.223 --> 30:09.474
(rattles)

30:09.557 --> 30:10.767
Tron uses a launch.

30:10.850 --> 30:13.603
(action music)

30:13.686 --> 30:15.271
It can blast outside the building...

30:15.355 --> 30:17.065
NARRATOR: <i>You did just say outside.</i>

30:17.148 --> 30:18.191
-The building.
-NARRATOR: <i>Right.</i>

30:18.274 --> 30:20.944
Every month, somebody tried
to convince me not to do that.

30:21.027 --> 30:23.112
BOB: <i>"Keep it inside the building.
We'd get rid of the whole canopy</i>

30:23.488 --> 30:25.490
<i>and it'll just be inside the building.
It'll cost a lot less."</i>

30:25.573 --> 30:27.826
NARRATOR: <i>Yeah, but it'd be
a lot less fun.</i>

30:27.909 --> 30:29.536
<i>So, Bob kept chipping away.</i>

30:29.953 --> 30:32.288
'Cause it is easier to take
a conservative solution,

30:32.622 --> 30:35.667
but that's not the Imagineering way.
We wanted to push forward,

30:35.750 --> 30:36.835
try to do something great.

30:36.918 --> 30:39.379
NARRATOR: <i>Don't you mean launch forward?
And they did.</i>

30:39.712 --> 30:43.800
<i>Because Walt's original idea
for what would become Space Mountain</i>

30:43.883 --> 30:47.053
<i>was now finally realized here in Shanghai.</i>

30:47.136 --> 30:49.597
SCOT: <i>That's something that
I think is truly unique</i>

30:49.681 --> 30:51.474
<i>to the Shanghai Disneyland experience,</i>

30:51.558 --> 30:54.894
and we thought that was a unique way
to experience a roller coaster.

30:54.978 --> 30:55.979
You can't say roller coaster.

30:56.062 --> 30:59.607
NARRATOR: <i>Especially now,
because on June 16th, 2016,</i>

30:59.691 --> 31:03.862
<i>the world of high-speed thrill attractions
was about to change forever.</i>

31:05.822 --> 31:08.366
<i>As Tron Lightcycle Power Run</i>

31:08.449 --> 31:12.078
<i>powered up at Shanghai Disneyland,
the response was...</i>

31:12.161 --> 31:13.997
<i>Well, what do you think?
Look at this thing!</i>

31:14.080 --> 31:15.707
(rattles)

31:15.790 --> 31:20.879
NARRATOR: <i>At 3,169 feet long
and over 88 feet tall,</i>

31:20.962 --> 31:22.589
<i>it's one of the fastest Disney coasters</i>

31:22.672 --> 31:25.258
<i>at any Disney Park anywhere on Earth.</i>

31:25.341 --> 31:27.427
It is a very high-speed attraction.

31:27.510 --> 31:28.386
ALEX: <i>I think
when you come out of the building,</i>

31:28.469 --> 31:30.263
<i>you get a real sense of speed.</i>

31:30.346 --> 31:33.391
When you're inside the building,
you have all these amazing show elements

31:33.474 --> 31:35.435
<i>and story points
being told all around you.</i>

31:35.518 --> 31:37.145
But it is just so much fun

31:37.228 --> 31:40.857
to be face-first
and just launched out into the land.

31:41.107 --> 31:42.734
Now, that's what I'm talking about!

31:44.360 --> 31:46.154
NARRATOR: <i>This Tron attraction is building</i>

31:46.237 --> 31:49.240
<i>upon 40 years of history and innovation,</i>

31:49.324 --> 31:53.953
<i>while probably also setting the stage
for the next 40 years of Disney</i>

31:54.037 --> 31:55.496
<i>high-speed thrill attractions.</i>

31:59.626 --> 32:04.714
<i>So, in the place where it all began,
Walt Disney World in Florida,</i>

32:05.298 --> 32:07.967
<i>well, things are going to change.</i>

32:08.468 --> 32:10.094
I think that, you know, Tron is...

32:11.179 --> 32:13.056
it's a natural next evolution in this,

32:13.139 --> 32:15.350
but it's also a step forward,
which is great.

32:15.433 --> 32:17.852
NARRATOR:
<i>And so, tomorrow has come to Florida</i>

32:17.936 --> 32:20.647
<i>as work begins on installing Tron</i>

32:20.730 --> 32:21.898
<i>at Walt Disney World.</i>

32:21.981 --> 32:25.318
Tron is being built right next
to Space Mountain itself.

32:25.401 --> 32:27.445
NARRATOR:
<i>Of course. The more, the merrier.</i>

32:27.528 --> 32:30.448
<i>Because here's the thing
about Space Mountain.</i>

32:30.531 --> 32:35.370
If I... if I was on my very last trip
to Disneyland, if I...

32:35.453 --> 32:39.290
if I could only go back one time,
and I only get to ride one ride...

32:40.375 --> 32:43.252
There are so many spectacular...
Disney attractions

32:43.336 --> 32:47.590
I've done over the years, and if I had
to just pick one to do one more time...

32:48.132 --> 32:51.761
-I think it might be Space Mountain.
-I have to ride Space Mountain.

32:51.844 --> 32:54.430
NARRATOR: <i>Space Mountain is unquestionably</i>

32:54.514 --> 32:58.142
<i>and overwhelmingly
a favorite the world over.</i>

32:58.226 --> 33:00.186
It... and it has such a sense
of nostalgia for me,

33:00.269 --> 33:03.272
growing up, when I would come here,
there as a kid, to ride it.

33:03.356 --> 33:05.316
I was a big chicken.

33:05.400 --> 33:08.945
It was kind of bragging rights
to go on Space Mountain as a kid.

33:09.278 --> 33:12.323
There was this moment when my...

33:12.657 --> 33:17.745
my dad took me to Space Mountain.
I must have been just a little tot.

33:18.496 --> 33:24.002
My sister had just arrived, and Mom
was in the hospital with baby sister,

33:24.877 --> 33:28.673
and it was gonna be
Dad's day out at the park.

33:28.756 --> 33:30.508
And I had never been
on Space Mountain before.

33:30.800 --> 33:33.094
And he took me on Space Mountain,
and I got off,

33:33.678 --> 33:37.306
and my heart's thumping 200 beats
a minute, and he sets me down,

33:37.390 --> 33:40.977
and he was so nervous.
But there's that connection.

33:42.520 --> 33:44.522
(sniffles)

33:44.647 --> 33:45.857
Wow.
(laughs)

33:47.233 --> 33:48.192
Wow.

33:49.068 --> 33:51.654
Yeah. It's, it's... It's family.

33:54.991 --> 33:58.494
Space Mountain is really, really special.

33:58.578 --> 34:00.038
NARRATOR: <i>It surely is.</i>

34:00.121 --> 34:04.083
<i>But why does Space Mountain
mean so much to so many?</i>

34:04.167 --> 34:05.877
It was done so right.

34:06.252 --> 34:09.172
The... the architecture
of the building is so iconic.

34:09.255 --> 34:11.758
MICHAEL: <i>Once you see it,
it's like nothing else you've ever seen.</i>

34:11.841 --> 34:14.719
NARRATOR: <i>But as for the experience
inside that dome,</i>

34:14.802 --> 34:16.721
<i>it's not the heart-pounding speed.</i>

34:16.804 --> 34:18.514
Space Mountain doesn't go that fast.

34:18.598 --> 34:19.766
But feels extremely fast.

34:19.849 --> 34:21.976
NARRATOR:
<i>Well, come on. It is pretty fast.</i>

34:22.060 --> 34:26.230
<i>And this simple idea of a rocket ship
hurtling through space,</i>

34:26.314 --> 34:29.484
<i>used not so much a vision of the future...</i>

34:29.567 --> 34:33.571
Many of the things that seem impossible
now will become realities tomorrow.

34:33.654 --> 34:37.700
<i>...but more a creative vision
that used both technology...</i>

34:37.784 --> 34:40.495
There are so many firsts
on Space Mountain.

34:40.578 --> 34:44.165
<i>...and ingenuity,
and took it to a whole new level.</i>

34:44.248 --> 34:46.209
JOHN: <i>And letting it run out by gravity.</i>

34:46.292 --> 34:48.419
NICHOLAS: <i>You might be,
what appears from the outside,</i>

34:48.503 --> 34:51.506
<i>to be inside a dark dome.
But when you're inside that,</i>

34:51.589 --> 34:53.966
you don't really think of that.
You don't remember that.

34:54.050 --> 34:56.803
You're in the star port.
You're going into the spaceship.

34:56.886 --> 34:59.722
<i>You're getting on. The music intensifies.</i>

34:59.806 --> 35:02.141
<i>You're going up the hill.
The lights are flashing.</i>

35:02.809 --> 35:05.394
<i>It builds a lot of excitement,
a lot of anticipation.</i>

35:05.478 --> 35:08.689
<i>The countdown at the top of the hill.
It's really dark.</i>

35:09.190 --> 35:11.692
<i>And then, before you know it,
you're going down the hill.</i>

35:11.776 --> 35:14.362
<i>And you're going, and you're going,
and you're going, and you're going.</i>

35:14.445 --> 35:16.405
<i>And you don't know which way is left
and which way is right.</i>

35:16.489 --> 35:19.117
<i>Was that a drop, or was that a hill?
You don't what's gonna happen.</i>

35:19.200 --> 35:20.535
NARRATOR: <i>Well, Walt knew.</i>

35:20.618 --> 35:23.037
WALT:
<i>After entering the Disneyland space port,</i>

35:23.121 --> 35:25.373
<i>visitors may experience the thrills</i>

35:25.456 --> 35:29.418
<i>that space travelers of the future
will encounter when rocket trips</i>

35:29.502 --> 35:31.462
<i>to the moon become a daily routine.</i>

35:31.879 --> 35:34.674
<i>However, scientists tell us
that it could be many years</i>

35:34.757 --> 35:36.759
<i>before space travel becomes a reality.</i>

35:37.468 --> 35:39.846
<i>If only Walt could see us now.</i>

35:39.929 --> 35:44.600
MAN 2: <i>Five, four, three, two, one.</i>

35:44.684 --> 35:46.310
(rattles)

35:49.063 --> 35:51.065
(closing theme music)
