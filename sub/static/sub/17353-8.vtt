ALL THE CONTENTS
WERE GOING TO THE TRASH.

28:43.621 --> 28:45.521
WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE COUPLE?

28:45.556 --> 28:47.191
BOTH HUSBAND AND WIFE
WERE BOTH PASSED

28:47.226 --> 28:48.791
WITHIN A MONTH OR SO
OF EACH OTHER.

28:48.826 --> 28:50.928
ARE YOU EVER CONCERNED THAT
YOU MAY BRING SOMETHING HOME

28:50.963 --> 28:52.830
WITH YOU
CONNECTED TO THE OBJECTS?

28:52.865 --> 28:54.330
I WAS JUST DOING MY JOB.

28:54.365 --> 28:57.435
RIGHT. JUST TAKING STUFF
OUT OF THE HOUSE.

28:57.470 --> 28:58.602
YEAH.

28:58.603 --> 29:00.303
SO OTHERWISE,
IT'D BE DESTROYED.

29:00.338 --> 29:02.507
YEAH, IT'D BE CRUSHED UP
AND THROWN AWAY.

29:06.144 --> 29:08.211
SO I WAS TALKING TO STEPHEN,

29:08.246 --> 29:10.348
AND HE WAS TALKING ABOUT HOW,
IN HIS JOB,

29:10.383 --> 29:11.814
THEY DO DEMOLITION.

29:11.849 --> 29:14.017
THEY WERE DEMOLISHING
AN ELDERLY COUPLE'S HOUSE.

29:14.052 --> 29:17.388
NOBODY DID AN ESTATE SALE. THEY
JUST DIED OF OLD AGE THEY SAID.

29:17.423 --> 29:20.759
THEY WENT IN TO DEMOL-- YOU
KNOW, TO TAKE DOWN THE HOUSE,

29:20.794 --> 29:23.562
AND ALL THEIR STUFF
WAS STILL THERE.

29:23.597 --> 29:26.330
HE SURROUNDS HIMSELF
WITH OBJECTS

29:26.365 --> 29:28.699
FROM PEOPLE WHO HAVE PASSED.

29:28.700 --> 29:30.684
WELL, I MEAN, WHEN MOST PEOPLE
GET ANTIQUES,

29:30.719 --> 29:32.634
THEY GET THEM FROM, LIKE,
AN ANTIQUE STORE.

29:32.669 --> 29:36.774
BUT IN THIS CASE, ALMOST EVERY
SINGLE ANTIQUE ITEM THEY HAVE

29:36.809 --> 29:39.776
HAS COME FROM ALMOST, LIKE,
A NEGATIVE SITUATION.

29:39.777 --> 29:42.680
MAYBE THAT'S SOMETHING
WE CAN USE TONIGHT IN
OUR INVESTIGATION

29:42.715 --> 29:44.648
AND SEE IF ANYBODY
PIPES UP.

29:44.683 --> 29:46.382
LIKE, "THAT'S MY TRUNK."

29:46.417 --> 29:48.386
ALL RIGHT, I'LL HOLD THE DOOR
OPEN FOR YOU.

29:52.156 --> 29:53.858
Bruni: A LOT OF EVIDENCE
WE'VE GOTTEN

29:53.893 --> 29:55.391
IS LEADING US TOWARD EDWARD.

29:55.426 --> 29:58.362
BUT WE DON'T KNOW IF HE WAS
THE ONE WHO SCARED NATHAN.

29:58.363 --> 30:01.766
I FOUND OUT HE HAD AN INTEREST
IN HAM RADIOS AND AIRPLANES.

30:01.801 --> 30:03.266
SO WE WILL USE WALKIE-TALKIES

30:03.301 --> 30:06.303
AND THE MODEL AIRPLANE
AS TRIGGER OBJECTS.

30:06.304 --> 30:08.506
WE ARE PLACING A WALKIE
AND THE RECORDER

30:08.541 --> 30:11.540
NEAR HIS PLANE IN NATHAN'S ROOM.

30:11.575 --> 30:14.211
ALL RIGHT, YOU SET IT UP.
I'M GONNA GO IN THE OTHER ROOM.

30:14.246 --> 30:16.113
WE'RE GOING TO ASK
EDWARD QUESTIONS

IN SAMANTHA'S ROOM

AS THE COMMUNICATION DEVICE.

30:24.857 --> 30:26.123
THAT'S GOOD.

TO THIS EDWARD CHARACTER.

- RIGHT.
- RIGHT.

39:43.714 --> 39:45.182
AND, SO, IN OUR LINE
OF EVP QUESTIONING,

39:45.217 --> 39:48.417
WE STARTED ASKING
FOR EDWARD HALL.

39:48.418 --> 39:52.156
AND THAT'S WHEN WE STARTED
GETTING SOME RESPONSES.

40:05.302 --> 40:06.936
- "I AM."
- "I AM."

40:06.971 --> 40:09.490
[ LAUGHS ]
OH, MY -- OH.

40:09.525 --> 40:11.974
Berry: <i> MR. HALL...</i>

40:12.009 --> 40:14.845
WERE YOU EVER SCARED FOR NATHAN
WHEN THAT STUFF WAS HAPPENING?

40:14.880 --> 40:15.811
HORRIFIED.

40:15.846 --> 40:17.764
WHY? LIKE,
WHAT WAS YOUR...

40:17.799 --> 40:19.648
'CAUSE HE'S
MY BABY BROTHER.

40:19.683 --> 40:21.702
WE GOT ANSWERS
THAT IT SAYS EDWARD.

40:21.737 --> 40:23.686
SO, LIKE...
- PRETTY SOLID ANSWERS.

40:23.721 --> 40:27.324
RIGHT. THAT IT'S EDWARD, AND HE
DIDN'T MEAN TO DO WHAT HE DID.

40:27.359 --> 40:28.957
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

40:28.992 --> 40:31.395
WE DON'T KNOW WHY
IT CAME ACROSS LIKE THAT.

40:31.430 --> 40:34.031
Bruni:
BECAUSE THEN WE GOT THIS.

40:38.302 --> 40:44.074
Bruni: <i> IS THERE A MESSAGE YOU'D
LIKE TO SEND TO THE FAMILY?</i>

40:44.109 --> 40:45.409
<i> NATHAN.</i>

40:48.978 --> 40:51.882
<i> IS THERE A MESSAGE
YOU'D LIKE TO SEND TO NATHAN?</i>

40:53.850 --> 40:54.884
<i> LOVE.</i>

40:57.921 --> 41:01.491
I MEAN...

41:01.492 --> 41:04.695
HEY, I THINK IT'S,
ALL AROUND, AWESOME.

41:04.730 --> 41:05.828
YEAH.

41:05.863 --> 41:07.897
THE LOVE THAT'S IN HERE
IS PRETTY STRONG.

41:07.932 --> 41:13.470
Bruni: IT REALLY IS THAT CLASSIC
UNFINISHED BUSINESS SCENARIO.

41:13.505 --> 41:16.439
WHERE THERE IS SOMEONE
WHO YOU GUYS

41:16.440 --> 41:19.108
MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN
AROUND HIM THAT MUCH,

41:19.143 --> 41:23.180
BUT YOU CLEARLY MEANT A LOT MORE
TO HIM THAN HE COULD EXPRESS.

41:23.215 --> 41:25.915
DO YOU FEEL SCARED
ANY MORE AT THIS POINT?

41:25.916 --> 41:27.048
NO. DEFINITELY NOT.

41:27.083 --> 41:29.485
LIKE, HE WAS, MOST LIKELY,

41:29.520 --> 41:31.821
JUST TRYING TO COMMUNICATE
AND DIDN'T KNOW HOW.

41:31.856 --> 41:32.423
IT MAKES ME FEEL...

41:32.458 --> 41:32.955
Samantha: HE LOVES YOU.

41:32.990 --> 41:33.990
YEAH. IT MAKES ME
FEEL A LOT BETTER.

41:34.025 --> 41:36.093
Amy: YEAH.
HOW COOL IS THAT?

41:36.128 --> 41:37.259
HE'S THE LAST PERSON

41:37.294 --> 41:39.261
THAT I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF
TO BE HERE.

41:39.296 --> 41:43.700
BUT IT'S ALSO COMFORTING TO KNOW
THAT SOMEONE IN YOUR FAMILY

41:43.735 --> 41:46.502
IS STILL KIND OF LINGERING
AND KEEPING AN EYE ON YOU.

41:46.503 --> 41:48.003
- RIGHT.
- AND, UM...

41:48.038 --> 41:51.742
AND TO KNOW THAT HE IS KEEPING
AN EYE NATHAN IS COMFORTING.

41:51.777 --> 41:53.209
YEAH.

41:53.244 --> 41:56.513
Bruni: LOSING CHARLIE THE WAY
THEY DID WAS A DEVASTATING LOSS.

41:56.548 --> 41:59.581
AND THE FAMILY WAS CLEARLY
HOPING TO HEAR FROM HIM.

41:59.616 --> 42:03.020
EVEN THOUGH THE ANSWERS WE GAVE
THEM WEREN'T WHAT THEY EXPECTED,

42:03.055 --> 42:06.089
WE WERE STILL ABLE TO GIVE THEM
SOME KIND OF CLOSURE.

42:06.124 --> 42:07.824
IF YOU COULD SEE HIM
ONE MORE TIME,

42:07.859 --> 42:09.325
JUST WHATEVER
YOU WOULD SAY.

42:09.360 --> 42:11.445
NATHAN CAN FINALLY
HAVE PEACE OF MIND

42:11.480 --> 42:13.495
KNOWING THAT THE ACTIVITY
HE EXPERIENCED

42:13.530 --> 42:16.233
WAS ACTUALLY CAUSED BY
HIS GREAT-GRANDFATHER.

42:16.268 --> 42:20.403
YOUR LOVE OF AIRCRAFT
WILL CONTINUE

42:20.438 --> 42:21.703
FOR SEVERAL GENERATIONS.

42:21.738 --> 42:24.241
IT WILL DEFINITELY
KEEP GOING.

42:24.276 --> 42:25.640
EDWARD CAN MOVE ON

42:25.675 --> 42:28.612
NOW THAT HE KNOWS NATHAN
IS CONTINUING HIS LEGACY

42:28.647 --> 42:31.549
AND WILL PASS IT ON
TO THE NEXT GENERATION.
