01:17.084 --> 01:18.984
My spoon got stuck when I tried
to stir it.

01:21.955 --> 01:23.856
Why are you drinking this?

01:23.923 --> 01:26.191
Because I'm going to
the theatre with Sandy tonight,

01:26.260 --> 01:28.628
and she always gets mad when
I fall asleep during the show.

01:28.695 --> 01:30.896
Mmhmm. Since when
do you go to the theatre?

01:30.964 --> 01:33.065
You do a lot of crazy things
for love, Toby.

01:33.133 --> 01:35.500
- You'll get there one day.
- I think I'm already there.

01:35.568 --> 01:37.902
Tia's invited me to dinner with
her and her friends on Friday.

01:37.970 --> 01:40.772
Really? That's right in the
belly of the beast, my friend.

01:40.839 --> 01:43.708
All those girls judging you,
scrutinizing your every move,

01:43.776 --> 01:45.843
wondering if you're good enough
for their friend.

01:45.911 --> 01:49.046
This would be one of those times when it
would be good to get inside her head.

01:49.166 --> 01:51.181
Yeah, well, to the
mysteries of women.

01:51.249 --> 01:53.049
- Terrifying.
- Thanks for the pep talk.

01:53.117 --> 01:55.286
Sorry, Code Orange
at quitting time.

01:55.353 --> 01:58.455
What'd I miss? Oh, we were just
having a little girl talk here.

01:58.523 --> 02:02.225
Aw. Are you guys bragging
about your amazing girlfriends?

02:02.294 --> 02:05.695
Actually, Toby's having dinner with Tia
and all of her friends on Friday night.

02:05.763 --> 02:07.697
- Really?
- Yeah, it's no big deal.

02:07.765 --> 02:09.732
Yeah, just like you bring
someone into one of those

02:09.800 --> 02:11.634
- two-way mirror rooms at work.
- It's ok. Look,

02:11.702 --> 02:13.803
if Tia and I are gonna have
a future together,

02:13.870 --> 02:15.123
these are the kind of moves
I have to make.

02:15.243 --> 02:18.240
You know what, just be yourself.
I'm sure you'll get the seal of approval.

02:18.309 --> 02:20.810
Just like I did
with all your friends, right?

02:20.877 --> 02:24.313
Well, we're still together,
so let's just leave it at that.

02:24.380 --> 02:28.149
Sandy, did you guys admit
a Louis Lyon?

02:28.217 --> 02:30.919
Yeah, gunshot victim.
Lost a lot of blood.

02:30.986 --> 02:34.489
Actually, he's post-op
right now.

02:34.557 --> 02:36.491
Cool, I guess I came
to the right place. Thank you.

02:36.559 --> 02:39.226
Is this a work thing, or...
Toby, you forgot your coffee.

02:39.294 --> 02:41.829
- Are you ready for the theatre?
- Yeah, sure. Hey, which

02:41.896 --> 02:44.064
of your friends doesn't like me?
They love you.

02:44.132 --> 02:46.066
- Is it Monica?
- No, Monica loves you.

02:46.134 --> 02:48.302
- Hey.
- Hey. Where's our guy?

02:48.370 --> 02:50.338
He just got out of the O.R.
Bullet went through his neck.

02:50.405 --> 02:53.173
- It's not looking good.
- Ok, well, the report says that

02:53.241 --> 02:55.945
he and his crew knocked over
three casinos in one afternoon.

02:56.065 --> 02:57.778
- Sounds like Metro business.
- No, there's a reason

02:57.846 --> 02:59.780
it got kicked upstairs to us.
They were dressed as cops.

02:59.848 --> 03:01.849
They even had a mocked-up
squad car.

03:01.916 --> 03:03.784
- How'd they pull that off?
- Told the manager they were

03:03.852 --> 03:05.853
looking for counterfeit,
and took off with all the cash.

03:05.920 --> 03:07.821
So, we got one guy clinging
to life. Where are the rest?

03:07.889 --> 03:09.789
The other two are still
on the loose. Klein wants them

03:09.857 --> 03:11.958
brought in as soon as possible.

03:12.026 --> 03:13.335
- Thanks.
- Hey.

03:13.455 --> 03:14.411
Hey.

03:14.531 --> 03:17.096
- Is this our guy?
- Yeah. Louis Lyon.

03:17.164 --> 03:19.465
A notorious street racer
with a history of drug problems.

03:19.533 --> 03:21.433
This guy owed a lot of people
a lot of money.

03:21.501 --> 03:23.469
Well, I guess the crew needed
a wheelman.

03:23.537 --> 03:26.438
- Let me see what I can get.
- Thanks, Dev.

03:26.506 --> 03:28.574
Hey, Louis.
We're with the IIB.

03:28.642 --> 03:30.576
We want to ask you
a few questions.

03:30.644 --> 03:32.144
Can you hear us?

03:32.212 --> 03:34.179
He's barely conscious.

03:34.246 --> 03:35.780
You know who shot you?

03:35.847 --> 03:39.984
Who are you working with?

03:40.052 --> 03:41.595
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa! What you doing?!

03:41.715 --> 03:42.768
Have you lost your mind?!

03:42.888 --> 03:45.623
(Monitor beeping rapidly)

03:48.894 --> 03:51.995
Nurse. Something's not right.
Nurse?

03:52.063 --> 03:54.431
I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave, please.

03:54.499 --> 03:56.433
Charging.

03:56.501 --> 03:58.235
Clear.

03:58.303 --> 04:00.604
Looks like he was shot
by one of his own guys.

04:03.708 --> 04:06.576
- Did you see the shooter?
- No, but someone tried to stop him.

04:06.643 --> 04:08.578
Ok, we'll get a facial
composite made up.

04:08.645 --> 04:11.314
No, we don't need to.
I know the guy.

04:14.851 --> 04:18.921
(Flatline tone)

04:18.988 --> 04:22.123
Well, now we have a murderer
on the streets.

04:25.194 --> 04:27.529
(Dev): - Is that him?
- Yeah.

04:27.597 --> 04:29.598
What have you been up to, Lenny?

04:29.665 --> 04:32.400
In and out of jail for B&Es,
by the looks of it.

04:32.468 --> 04:35.337
Busted a few times for
possession, selling contraband.

04:35.404 --> 04:38.172
So far, nothing as sophisticated
as what went down yesterday.

04:38.240 --> 04:40.174
Guess he's got
some new friends.

04:40.242 --> 04:42.309
How do you know this guy?

04:44.279 --> 04:46.347
Ah, foster care.

04:46.414 --> 04:48.616
He was kind of like
a big brother to me.

04:48.683 --> 04:51.052
Problem was, when we'd hang out,
we'd get into a lot of trouble,

04:51.120 --> 04:54.187
so they had to split us up.
I haven't seen him since.

04:54.255 --> 04:56.322
One of you managed
to clean up good.

04:56.390 --> 04:59.860
And the other has an outstanding warrant.
Parole violation.

04:59.927 --> 05:01.694
Thank you, Metro backlogs.

05:01.763 --> 05:04.297
You guys have all seen this?

05:04.365 --> 05:06.233
The public is aware
that these criminals are

05:06.300 --> 05:08.501
dressing up as cops
and ripping people off.

05:08.569 --> 05:10.870
We gotta resolve this
before panic sets in.

05:10.937 --> 05:14.573
Ok, so let's have a little reunion. We
can bring Len in and see what Toby gets.

05:14.641 --> 05:16.541
And let his buddies scatter
in the wind?

05:16.609 --> 05:19.678
We have a chance to break
this operation top to bottom.

05:19.746 --> 05:22.414
- Toby has a great in with these guys.
- I'm sorry,

05:22.482 --> 05:25.251
- you want to embed Toby?
- What do you think, Logan?

05:25.318 --> 05:28.487
- Are you ready for this kind of assignment?
- Yeah, in all honesty, I'd love

05:28.554 --> 05:30.355
to give it a shot. I've been
training for six months.

05:30.423 --> 05:32.724
Well, those guys are probably
looking for a new wheelman.

05:32.792 --> 05:35.560
Why not our fast and furious
EMS driver?

05:35.628 --> 05:37.061
Are you serious?

05:37.129 --> 05:38.930
What? He's got mad skills.

05:38.998 --> 05:41.633
We're not talking about
driving here. We're talking

05:41.701 --> 05:44.034
about a dangerous undercover
operation.

05:44.102 --> 05:47.605
I know. I was joking. I was actually joking.
It's a bad idea.

05:47.673 --> 05:49.840
Actually,
the driving angle is good.

05:49.908 --> 05:53.210
Let's get him set up.
They played us. Let's play them.

05:53.278 --> 05:55.212
(Toby): Yeah.

05:55.280 --> 05:57.615
(Michelle sighs.)

05:57.683 --> 06:00.049
She'll be ok.

06:00.117 --> 06:03.820
Hey, I do have an in.

06:03.887 --> 06:06.456
I have advanced driver training.
I can get us on the inside.

06:06.524 --> 06:08.925
- I know what you can do.
- So what is this about?

06:08.992 --> 06:11.428
You're against me taking on
responsibility in the Bureau?

06:11.495 --> 06:13.963
No, this isn't about
responsibility. It's about risk.

06:14.031 --> 06:16.532
- I've taken risks before.
- No, not like this.

06:16.599 --> 06:19.935
I mean, they killed one of their own men, Toby.
They could just as easily turn on you.

06:20.002 --> 06:22.103
If they're gonna turn on me,
I'm gonna see it coming.

06:22.171 --> 06:24.306
I'll stay one step
ahead of them.

06:24.374 --> 06:26.942
I've been training for this.
I'm ready for this.

06:27.009 --> 06:28.677
Plus, you've got my back.

06:28.745 --> 06:31.612
Ok.

06:31.680 --> 06:33.481
You go in long enough

06:33.549 --> 06:36.451
just to identify the key
players, and then we take over.

06:36.518 --> 06:38.553
- Understood?
- Understood.

06:38.620 --> 06:40.521
- Yo, skills.
- Yo.

06:40.589 --> 06:42.523
- We tracked down your old pal.
- Where is he at?

06:42.591 --> 06:46.160
First you need a detailed
testable story, ok?

06:46.228 --> 06:48.928
You need to know it cold.
One slip, and you're dead.

06:48.996 --> 06:52.332
- Understood.
- Oh, yeah. I gotta switch out your phone.

06:52.400 --> 06:55.769
This one's clean.
Generic text messages, contacts.

06:55.837 --> 06:59.305

gonna have this one tracked.

over the next few days.

07:02.276 --> 07:03.942

I got a couple ideas. Come on.

07:25.464 --> 07:27.532
- Yeah.
- What is it?

07:27.652 --> 07:28.847
- Classified.

07:28.967 --> 07:30.368
No. No, I can't.

07:30.436 --> 07:33.638
- God.
- We can reschedule ASAP.

09:56.406 --> 09:59.407
Never forgot you, man.

09:59.474 --> 10:01.843
Why are you running
from the cops, Lenny?

10:01.911 --> 10:03.945
(Lenny sighs.)

10:04.013 --> 10:07.348
I don't know, man. There's always
something with these guys, you know.

10:07.416 --> 10:10.051
Maybe I haven't checked in
with my parole officer,

10:10.118 --> 10:12.587
you know, maybe too long.
Whatever.

10:12.655 --> 10:15.556
The things I do
for a bombers fan.

10:25.090 --> 10:26.990
- Good seeing you, dude.
- Thank you so much, man.

10:27.058 --> 10:28.592
You too, brother.

10:32.095 --> 10:34.196
- Yo, hey, Len, Len.
- Yeah?

10:34.265 --> 10:36.399
Are you sure you don't want me
to give you a ride home, man?

10:36.467 --> 10:39.969
- It's not a problem at all.
- I got some stuff I gotta finish up, man.

10:40.036 --> 10:43.305
- Thanks again, brother.
- Yeah, dude.

10:43.373 --> 10:47.709
Shaking off the cops...
kinda feels like old times, huh?

10:47.777 --> 10:52.046
Yeah. You know what? Wait.
Let me, uh...

10:52.114 --> 10:55.317
Let me give you my number.
Any time you need a fast ride,

10:55.385 --> 10:57.286
you hit me up at this,
all right?

10:57.353 --> 11:00.087
- I could use something.
- Yeah?

11:00.155 --> 11:02.657
Yeah.

11:02.724 --> 11:06.494
I might know of an opening.

11:06.561 --> 11:08.162
Yeah?

11:08.229 --> 11:11.499
Meet me back here tomorrow
around eight.

11:11.566 --> 11:12.771
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, man.

11:12.891 --> 11:15.602
- Should I bring my résumé?
- "Should I bring my résumé?"

11:15.670 --> 11:17.604
- Come on.
- Come alone. Bring your car.

11:17.672 --> 11:20.607
- All right. Lenny!
- Toby! Toby!

11:26.380 --> 11:28.315
- Are you clear to talk?
- [Yeah, I'm alone.]

11:28.382 --> 11:32.818
- [Len bought the setup?]
- Yeah, I'm 99% sure.

11:32.885 --> 11:34.920
Ok, well, make it a hundred.
Anything less, you could be

11:34.987 --> 11:37.356
- walking into a trap.
<i>- Yeah, I hope not.</i>

11:37.424 --> 11:39.391
Look, he wants to meet me
tomorrow morning.

11:39.459 --> 11:42.294
[Ok, good. Maybe he'll be
making some introductions.]

11:42.362 --> 11:44.262
We'll have you
under surveillance.

11:44.331 --> 11:46.698
Dev is flooding the net
with phoney rap sheets,

11:46.765 --> 11:49.200
<i>mug shots,
social media profiles.</i>

11:49.267 --> 11:51.268
Oh, that's hardcore.

11:51.337 --> 11:53.938
Well, they're pros.
They're gonna do their homework.

11:54.005 --> 11:56.941
- All right, I'll see you tomorrow morning.
- Not if I'm any good at my job.

12:06.851 --> 12:08.685
God, it's cold.

12:08.753 --> 12:11.054
- Cold?
- I hate it, man.

12:14.759 --> 12:16.360
So, who are we meeting?

12:16.427 --> 12:18.794
I told you a hundred times,
I can't tell you his name.

12:18.862 --> 12:20.796
All right. When is this guy
gonna show up?

12:20.864 --> 12:22.531
Why? You in a hurry?

12:22.599 --> 12:24.032
I get impatient.

12:24.100 --> 12:26.034
- Toby.
- Yeah?

12:26.102 --> 12:28.337
We're not calling the shots
with this guy.

12:28.405 --> 12:30.439
- Ok?
- Yeah.

12:33.377 --> 12:34.843
All units stand by.

12:34.910 --> 12:37.812
If Logan adjusts his watch,
we move.

12:37.880 --> 12:39.381
Ok, we have a visitor.

12:39.448 --> 12:41.082
There he is.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.934
- What's up, man?
- This your boy?

13:01.002 --> 13:02.536
Yeah. Toby.

13:08.074 --> 13:10.410
What's your name?

13:10.477 --> 13:14.013
- You find out if you pass. Get in the car.
- Where am I going?

13:14.080 --> 13:17.182
Len'll tell you when you get there. You
got a minute to get there and back.

13:17.250 --> 13:20.286
Yeah. If I don't?

13:20.353 --> 13:22.487
Then you keep driving,

13:22.555 --> 13:24.856
pray our paths
never cross again.

13:24.924 --> 13:28.092
Cool.

13:28.160 --> 13:30.228
- Do you think I'm joking?
- No.

13:30.296 --> 13:34.499
- It's ok. We got this. We got this. Let's go.
- Clock's ticking.

13:43.942 --> 13:45.943
He's on the move.
Do we pursue?

13:46.010 --> 13:48.746
He didn't signal.
It could be a test.

13:52.918 --> 13:55.351
- Dev, do you have him?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

13:55.419 --> 13:58.387
His GPS shows that he went
left on Unwin.

13:58.456 --> 14:00.990
Dude is really moving.

14:09.545 --> 14:13.707
He's heading South on Cherry Street. If he
keeps going, it's just gonna be a dead end.

14:22.745 --> 14:25.013
He just did a 180.
Looks like he's headed back.

14:25.081 --> 14:27.114
Go, Toby!

14:37.392 --> 14:39.126
I bet he's enjoying this.

14:50.505 --> 14:53.807
Woooo-hoo! That was good!

14:53.875 --> 14:56.275
So, how'd I do?

14:56.343 --> 14:58.811
A minute five.
Not bad.

14:58.879 --> 15:01.680
That was really good.
That was really good.

15:01.748 --> 15:05.217
You did good, Len.

15:05.284 --> 15:07.219
- Burke.
- Hey.

15:07.286 --> 15:09.622
Cool. So, Len says
there's a job coming up?

15:09.689 --> 15:12.290
Plans are being made, yeah.

15:17.295 --> 15:19.497
- How many guys are on the crew?
- Whoa, easy on the questions.

15:19.565 --> 15:21.499
I just want to know how many
ways we're splitting it.

15:21.567 --> 15:24.335
You'll know what you need
to know.

15:24.403 --> 15:26.671
It's ok, man.
Burke, he's cool.

15:26.739 --> 15:29.040
Gun. He's got a gun.

15:29.107 --> 15:31.074
Careful, Toby.

15:31.142 --> 15:32.776
Do we move in?

15:34.746 --> 15:37.347
Stand by.
He didn't signal.

15:37.415 --> 15:39.583
You keep your mouth shut
till you hear from us.

15:39.651 --> 15:42.886
Just worry about following
directions.

15:42.954 --> 15:47.489
Half's yours. We split
the rest! In, out, gone.

15:47.558 --> 15:50.560
You did good. Toby!

15:50.627 --> 15:52.628
- I'll call you later.
- Yeah, man.

16:03.172 --> 16:04.706
He's in.

16:09.011 --> 16:11.345
Are you excited
for your first night

16:11.413 --> 16:14.382
- in our awesome safe house?
- <i>Yeah, the one</i>

16:14.450 --> 16:16.484
with no hot water
and the rat infestation?

16:16.552 --> 16:19.954
<i>Well, now that Burke has seen you,
we can't really take any chances.</i>

16:20.021 --> 16:21.922
I'm pretty pumped
to stay there.

16:21.990 --> 16:24.158
<i>So, keys are next
to the cauliflower.</i>

16:24.226 --> 16:26.294
Thank you.
What's going on with Burke?

16:26.361 --> 16:28.429
<i>He is a criminal
shape-shifter,</i>

16:28.497 --> 16:31.399
Extremely unpredictable. He's
been linked to numerous crimes.

16:31.467 --> 16:34.635
You know, you made him
kind of jumpy yesterday.

16:34.703 --> 16:36.703
<i>Yeah, I was trying to get
as much as I could.</i>

16:36.770 --> 16:39.239
- You almost got yourself shot.
- <i>Yeah, I thought you might</i>

16:39.307 --> 16:41.308
pounce when he reached
for his gun.

16:41.375 --> 16:44.144
<i>Well, I thought about it, but, you
know, you had to do your job.</i>

16:44.212 --> 16:47.046
What about you?
Did you get anything?

16:47.115 --> 16:48.982
I think someone's working
behind the scenes.

16:49.049 --> 16:51.984
I couldn't get an ID,
but I think

16:52.051 --> 16:54.286
something's being planned.
I saw a heavily guarded door.

16:54.354 --> 16:56.955
Ok, well, keep digging.

16:57.023 --> 16:59.592
We have 24 hours
until Klein pulls the plug.

16:59.659 --> 17:02.194
<i>If you can get anything
on their next target, great.</i>

17:02.262 --> 17:05.998
<i>If not, we'll bring Burke in. I'm sure his
gun will match the one used on the victim.</i>

17:06.065 --> 17:07.632
And Len?

17:07.699 --> 17:10.635
Well, if he turns witness,
they might go easy on him.

17:10.702 --> 17:12.637
What about this mystery man?

17:12.704 --> 17:15.272
The one sending out fake cops
to terrorize the public.

17:15.340 --> 17:18.409
<i>If you can get anything on him,
we'll bring him in as well.</i>

17:18.477 --> 17:20.645
Cool. You got a dollar?

17:20.712 --> 17:24.214
I would, uh, really like
to buy this apple.

17:26.317 --> 17:28.185
Hey,

17:28.252 --> 17:30.420
- Oz. You got the bag?
- Yeah, yeah.

17:30.488 --> 17:32.722
- Nice.
- Here ya go.

17:32.790 --> 17:35.651
- Appreciate it. I gotta jet though, man.
- Hey, hey, wait, wait, wait.

17:35.771 --> 17:38.773
You call me up, you have
me meet you here

17:38.893 --> 17:40.310
with an overnight bag,
with a T-shirt, underwear,

17:40.430 --> 17:42.331
toiletries. You're not gonna
tell me what's going on?

17:42.399 --> 17:44.233
Dude, I can't tell you
what's up right now.

17:44.301 --> 17:46.304
Aren't you supposed to be meeting
Tia and all her friends tonight?

17:46.424 --> 17:50.139
It's been postponed. Look,
I'm on the clock right now, ok?

17:50.207 --> 17:52.741
I can't really be seen
with people I know.

17:52.809 --> 17:56.144
Are you on a stakeout right now? Like an
undercover thing? Is that what's happening?

17:56.212 --> 17:59.447
If I was undercover, do you think
I'd be talking about it right now?

17:59.515 --> 18:01.583
Does that mean
you are undercover

18:01.651 --> 18:03.602
'cause we're not talking about it?
Is that the code?

18:03.722 --> 18:07.157
Ok, right now my life kinda depends
on convincing some guys

18:07.277 --> 18:08.438
that I'm not really who I am.

18:08.558 --> 18:11.392
- You get that?
- Ok, ok.

18:11.459 --> 18:13.427
- I'm glad that...
- Enjoy the game.

18:13.495 --> 18:15.496
- Yeah, sure, be careful.
- Cool. See you, buddy.

18:15.564 --> 18:18.499
- Hey! Look who it is. You come here too?
- Burke.

18:18.567 --> 18:20.487
Good to see you, my friend.
You're not leaving are you?

18:20.607 --> 18:21.349
No, I'm not.

18:21.469 --> 18:23.504
- No?
- Hanging out.

18:27.591 --> 18:31.026
- You gonna introduce me to your friend?
- Burke. This is my buddy...

18:31.094 --> 18:33.060
- Mo. It's Mo.
- Good to meet you, Mo.

18:33.128 --> 18:35.096
- All right.
- Hey.

18:38.700 --> 18:40.701
- Have a seat.
- Yeah.

18:44.172 --> 18:47.708
So... what's up, Burke?

18:47.775 --> 18:49.942
Just checking in
on my new friend.

18:50.010 --> 18:52.512
Nice. Hey, Mo, you wanna
grab us two beers?

18:52.580 --> 18:55.248
- Yeah. Maple Lake good for you?
- Sweet.

18:55.316 --> 18:58.184
- All right, a couple of Maple Lakes.
- Thanks, Mo.

18:58.252 --> 19:01.221
What the hell is this?
What, you don't trust me?

19:01.288 --> 19:02.888
I don't trust anybody.

19:02.956 --> 19:05.690
I did some diggin'. Asked my
friend at Millhaven about you.

19:05.758 --> 19:08.293
- And?
- Your story checks out.

19:08.361 --> 19:10.562
Makes me wonder why I never
heard of you before.

19:10.630 --> 19:13.798
Hey, I don't know. What you
see is what you get, Burke.

19:13.866 --> 19:17.769
All right, here we go.
A couple of beers.

19:17.837 --> 19:20.672
One for you. I gotta hit the road, so
thanks very much. Very nice to meet you.

19:20.740 --> 19:24.842
Nice to meet you.
Let me ask you a question.

19:24.909 --> 19:26.377
Just take a minute.

19:26.445 --> 19:28.979
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

19:29.047 --> 19:31.249
(Oz): <i>It's ok, I got this.</i>

19:31.316 --> 19:36.254
Uh, what can I do for you?

19:36.321 --> 19:38.755
How long have you known
my friend Toby?

19:38.822 --> 19:41.958
Oh, about eight or nine months.

19:42.026 --> 19:44.427
- Give or take, right? Yeah.
- Yeah. Yeah, sure.

19:44.495 --> 19:46.095
Where'd you two kids meet?

19:46.164 --> 19:48.031
Payout line at Woodbine.

19:48.098 --> 19:50.933
Yeah. We both bet
on the same horse.

19:51.001 --> 19:53.402
So... cha-ching!

19:53.470 --> 19:55.571
What was the name of the horse?

19:55.639 --> 19:58.006
(Oz): - <i>Sparklehoof.</i>
(Toby and Oz): - <i>Sparklehoof.</i>

19:58.074 --> 20:01.243
(Laughing) You laugh, but it paid
eight to one. You remember that?

20:01.363 --> 20:02.122
Sparklehoof!

20:02.242 --> 20:04.780
- It was a great night.
- Yeah, very good night.

20:04.847 --> 20:08.150
Yeah. Huh.

20:08.218 --> 20:10.518
Toby ever tell you
what he does for a living?

20:10.586 --> 20:12.420
What, besides clean up
at the ponies?

20:12.488 --> 20:15.390
I don't really ask questions.
Not really my style.

20:15.457 --> 20:18.593
I'm more of a, uh,
strong, silent type.

20:18.661 --> 20:20.928
- Ok.
(Toby): - Cool.

20:20.996 --> 20:22.530
Cool.

20:24.567 --> 20:26.833
- I'll see you around.
- Yeah, man.

20:26.901 --> 20:29.403
- Yeah.
- What about your beer?

20:31.439 --> 20:33.574
Yeah? To new friends?

20:33.641 --> 20:36.176
Yeah. To new friends.

20:45.785 --> 20:49.622
I'll see you around.

20:49.690 --> 20:52.191
- You too, buddy.
- Yeah, right on, man.

20:55.028 --> 20:58.363
So, I apologize for putting you
in the line of fire.

20:58.431 --> 21:02.166
It was really stupid of me. Oh, it's
totally fine. I love hanging out

21:02.235 --> 21:06.438
with people that are ex-cons that I
met at the race track, you know?

21:06.505 --> 21:09.307
You did good.

21:09.375 --> 21:12.143
Yeah. Hey, do you think
he bought that with the whole...

21:12.211 --> 21:14.278
with the race track and Mo
and all that?

21:14.346 --> 21:16.947
Sparklehoof?
Yeah, it was brilliant.

21:17.014 --> 21:18.972
It's a turkish detergent.
It just popped into my head.

21:19.249 --> 21:22.419
Look, spend 10, 15 minutes here
before you go home, all right?

21:22.487 --> 21:26.123
- Make sure no one follows you.
- Ok. Stay here for more time?

21:26.190 --> 21:29.592
- Yeah. Thanks, Mo.
- Great.

21:29.660 --> 21:32.562
♪ You've got something
wrong with you ♪

21:35.466 --> 21:38.568
- Oh, sweet!
- What?

21:38.636 --> 21:40.836
Check it out. The new promos
for the club.

21:40.904 --> 21:43.873
- Aw, nice. That's sexy.
- Of course.

21:43.940 --> 21:46.107
(Michelle laughs.)
You guys have DJs now.

21:46.175 --> 21:48.209
Yeah, well, you know,
people are coming in,

21:48.278 --> 21:50.679
so we want to give them
a reason to stay.

21:50.747 --> 21:53.649
And spend lots
and lots of money,

21:53.716 --> 21:56.951
which then I will in turn use to
buy you lots and lots of gifts.

21:57.019 --> 22:00.054
- Ah, you're going to spoil me?
- That's the plan.

22:00.122 --> 22:02.556
(Cell phone beeping)

22:02.624 --> 22:04.825
Everything ok?

22:04.893 --> 22:07.528
Sorry. I'm just
a little preoccupied.

22:07.596 --> 22:09.563
another work crisis?

22:09.631 --> 22:13.367
Yeah, Toby, he's undercover.
He had a surprise visitor

22:13.435 --> 22:16.771
last night, so I'm just checking
to make sure everything's ok.

22:16.838 --> 22:18.938
Toby's a big boy.
He can handle himself.

22:19.006 --> 22:21.474
I'm responsible
if anything happened.

22:21.542 --> 22:23.876
This is so maternal of you.
I love it.

22:23.944 --> 22:26.979
Seriously? We're having
this conversation right now?

22:27.047 --> 22:28.515
Sure, come on.

22:28.582 --> 22:31.918
Seems to be a fitting time.
But, I mean, really,

22:31.985 --> 22:35.220
what are we talking about here?
Look, the club's doing good,

22:35.288 --> 22:37.155
we're doing good.

22:37.223 --> 22:39.224
I saw a mattress store
back there.

22:39.292 --> 22:43.729
- Maybe now is the time?
- Soon. Soon, ok? I gotta go.

22:43.797 --> 22:45.931
I know.

22:45.998 --> 22:48.500
- I love you.
- I love you too.

22:48.568 --> 22:50.501
Soon.

22:52.504 --> 22:55.906
Corporal Clark. To what do you
owe the pleasure of my company?

22:55.974 --> 22:59.143
I've been going through the reports
of all the officers who responded

22:59.211 --> 23:01.178
- to the casino heists.
- What do you got?

23:01.246 --> 23:03.581
Well, a couple of things
jumped out at me. For one,

23:03.649 --> 23:07.083
they were all floored by how heavy
the traffic was along their routes.

23:07.151 --> 23:09.386
Is that a surprise?
It was rush hour.

23:09.454 --> 23:11.455
Yeah, but the getaway car
was able

23:11.522 --> 23:13.623
to just burn through traffic
and avoid roadblocks.

23:13.691 --> 23:16.493
And they were nowhere near the
bogus cruiser when it crashed.

23:16.561 --> 23:19.463
Right. So, their wheelman is a street
racer, but nobody's that good.

23:19.530 --> 23:22.698
Exactly, and the weird thing
is, Metro traffic

23:22.766 --> 23:26.335
management didn't flag any problems
around the time of the chase.

23:26.403 --> 23:29.071
Toby got a read of a map
on that guy's tablet.

23:29.138 --> 23:31.106
Could there be a way
to manipulate

23:31.174 --> 23:33.476
the traffic signals
along the escape route?

23:33.543 --> 23:35.811
Individual signals could be
pre-empted remotely,

23:35.879 --> 23:38.646
but as far as making a path
through the whole downtown core,

23:38.714 --> 23:42.316
- that's taking it to a whole other level.
- Mm. Might be worth a chat

23:42.385 --> 23:44.318
with Traffic Management
Services.

23:44.387 --> 23:46.454
And can you pick me up
another one of these sandwiches?

23:46.522 --> 23:49.123
That was good. Maybe something
on rye or whole wheat.

23:49.191 --> 23:51.125
- Really?
- Thank you.

23:51.193 --> 23:53.327
(Michelle): - Toby's online.
- Got it.

23:53.395 --> 23:57.330
Toby. How did Burke know
that you were at the bar?

23:57.399 --> 23:59.795
- He must have followed me.
- I can't believe you waited

23:59.915 --> 24:00.915
until this morning to tell us.

24:01.035 --> 24:04.037
- <i>I didn't want to worry you guys.</i>
- And Oz?

24:04.105 --> 24:07.741
I shouldn't have had him meet me there.
He played it like a pro,

24:07.809 --> 24:09.876
<i>but it's not a mistake
I'll make twice.</i>

24:09.943 --> 24:12.068
Well, that's a mistake Oz could
have paid for. You both could have.

24:12.188 --> 24:16.716
But we didn't. We didn't. If Burke
had made me, I would have read it.

24:16.784 --> 24:18.851
Toby's work is paying off,
but we still don't know

24:18.919 --> 24:21.621
who's calling the shots.
Priority one has to be mapping

24:21.688 --> 24:23.956
the chain of command and
bringing down our mystery man.

24:24.024 --> 24:26.024
I can do it. I'm close.

24:26.091 --> 24:27.992
Keep your lines
of communication open.

24:28.060 --> 24:30.662
We'll monitor your calls.
And let's get this done.

24:30.730 --> 24:33.164
Right. The sooner we get him,
the sooner I get my life back.

24:33.232 --> 24:37.569
<i>- I'll see you guys later.</i>
- He'll be fine.

24:40.606 --> 24:44.442
Welcome to the neurocentre of
Metro Traffic Control Operations.

24:44.509 --> 24:48.779
You got like a crack team
of cyber geeks running the show?

24:48.847 --> 24:51.181
Yeah. One geek over here.

24:51.249 --> 24:54.985
Now, they mostly monitor
for traffic jams,

24:55.053 --> 24:57.020
update the signs,
"Left Lane Blocked".

24:57.088 --> 24:59.756
- You know, that kind of thing.
- What about inside the city?

24:59.824 --> 25:02.024
Can you guys control
the stoplights?

25:02.092 --> 25:04.494
Well, the transcore system is
fully automated.

25:04.562 --> 25:06.529
There's sensors
at all major intersections

25:06.597 --> 25:08.264
controlling the traffic flow.

25:08.332 --> 25:11.534
What about remotely?
Are there some kind of devices

25:11.602 --> 25:13.436
that could override the signal?

25:13.504 --> 25:15.213
Well, those devices have
rolling codes,

25:15.333 --> 25:17.311
so you have to be logged
on to the system.

25:17.431 --> 25:18.788
Mind if I take a look?

25:18.908 --> 25:21.510
Go right ahead.

25:21.578 --> 25:23.879
What are these numbers?
Are they call numbers?

25:23.999 --> 25:25.526
Cops, fire, all that.

25:28.651 --> 25:30.352
We just watch.

25:30.419 --> 25:32.687
If it looks like something's
affecting traffic,

25:32.754 --> 25:35.890
we throw it up on our site,
then radio and TV picks it up.

25:35.958 --> 25:39.427
That's right. Anything else?

25:39.495 --> 25:41.966
You guys keep records
of traffic incidents, right?

25:42.086 --> 25:44.429
Yeah, you can get all
of that information on site.

25:44.549 --> 25:46.147
Yeah, you'd think.

25:46.267 --> 25:49.870
None of this interweb stuff
comes very naturally to me.

25:49.937 --> 25:51.905
- Really?
- Yeah.

25:51.973 --> 25:54.174
- Thanks for your time, though.
- You bet.

26:04.485 --> 26:08.087
So, I'm still out here waiting, Michelle.
No sign of them.

26:08.155 --> 26:10.990
- Are you hearing him?
- Yeah. He's coming in loud and clear.

26:11.058 --> 26:13.435
I told him not to talk to us.
It looks suspicious.

26:13.555 --> 26:14.441
<i>Here they come.</i>

26:14.561 --> 26:16.629
Yeah, I see that, Toby.
Thank you.

26:16.696 --> 26:19.131
- Toby!
- Hey. What's up, man?

26:19.198 --> 26:20.732
How you doing, man?

26:20.799 --> 26:22.734
- Crazy.
- Ready to go?

26:22.801 --> 26:24.903
Yeah, yeah. My car's
over here. Let's do this.

26:24.970 --> 26:28.206
No, no, no. That hunk of junk's
not gonna cut it. Come on. This way.

26:28.274 --> 26:30.575
- Ok.
- No, what the hell is he doing?

26:30.643 --> 26:33.478
- He's supposed to take them to his car.
<i>- I got eyes on him.</i>

26:33.546 --> 26:34.841
It looks like they're heading
into the mall.

26:34.961 --> 26:36.395
<i>Great time to go shopping.</i>

26:36.515 --> 26:39.417
- Should we follow?
<i>- No, they might have a lookout.</i>

26:47.358 --> 26:50.594
- So, where is it, Len?
- She should be here any minute.

26:50.662 --> 26:52.529
Ok, they came out
the other side.

26:52.597 --> 26:54.565
I'm gonna go check it out.
I don't like this.

26:58.535 --> 27:00.736
Oh, there she is.
Right on time.

27:00.804 --> 27:02.337
It's the ambulance?

27:02.405 --> 27:04.373
You kidding me?
We figured

27:04.441 --> 27:06.642
you'd know your way around it.
I've been watching these guys.

27:06.710 --> 27:09.445
They come here every day
at the exact same time.

27:09.512 --> 27:11.614
- You sure about this?
- What's wrong with you?

27:11.682 --> 27:14.282
You going to pull this crap
when we do the job?

27:14.349 --> 27:16.685
- Guys, we have seven minutes.
- Gimme your phone.

27:16.752 --> 27:18.419
Gimme your phone.

27:18.487 --> 27:20.956
Let's go.

27:21.023 --> 27:23.458
Ok, we're counting on you
here, Toby, ok?

27:23.525 --> 27:25.526
- I got this, Len. I got it.
- Ok?

27:28.430 --> 27:30.523
Get another one with
the money you're gonna make.

27:30.643 --> 27:31.478
Cover me, Toby.

27:31.598 --> 27:33.300
Yeah, yeah, I got your back.

27:36.638 --> 27:38.792
Ok, he's on the move.
He's heading north on Bay Street.

27:38.912 --> 27:40.388
Michelle: <i>In what vehicle?</i>

27:40.508 --> 27:42.542
I don't know.

27:44.613 --> 27:47.213
You're in. Nice.

27:47.280 --> 27:48.881
(Ambulance starting)

27:52.486 --> 27:55.088
You know these trucks have
transponders, right?

27:55.155 --> 27:58.858
- Thanks, genius. Taken care of.
- Signal jammer. That's great.

27:58.926 --> 28:00.793
Let's go!

28:12.190 --> 28:13.427
Toby's phone?

28:13.675 --> 28:16.510
They tossed it into the back
of a truck. We lost him.

28:16.578 --> 28:18.879
He's out there
without a safety net.

28:18.947 --> 28:22.149
All right, let's just assume that he's
continuing to collect the evidence

28:22.217 --> 28:24.385
that we need
to put these guys away.

28:24.453 --> 28:27.620
Or he's out there in a ditch
somewhere with a bullet in his head.

28:27.688 --> 28:30.190
- Michelle...
- Maybe not. I got a report

28:30.257 --> 28:33.960
of an ambulance that was stolen a block
away from Toby's last known location.

28:34.027 --> 28:36.062
An ambulance?
Are they changing their game?

28:36.130 --> 28:38.864
Well, at least Toby knows his
way around that kind of vehicle.

28:38.932 --> 28:42.402
I'll put out an alert. Put out the word
out that if they find that ambulance,

28:42.470 --> 28:44.369
they're not to make a move
until we give the ok.

28:44.437 --> 28:47.372
We want to get Toby out of there
without incident.

28:47.440 --> 28:49.241
(Dev): - Huh.
(Michelle): - What?

28:49.309 --> 28:51.643
I hacked into the Traffic
Management site.

28:51.711 --> 28:53.445
The log shows malfunctions

28:53.513 --> 28:55.714
at every intersection
along the escape route,

28:55.781 --> 28:57.682
but no traffic warnings were
posted.

28:57.750 --> 28:59.398
Was someone trying
to cover it up?

28:59.518 --> 29:03.321
Yeah, someone was using a spoofed IP
from within the system at the time.

29:03.388 --> 29:05.956
- So it wasn't a malfunction.
- Whoever did it was good,

29:06.024 --> 29:07.958
but I'm gonna track them
through the weeds.

29:08.026 --> 29:10.861
Ok, this is weird.

29:10.929 --> 29:14.698
The IP connection is coming
from inside Traffic Management.

29:14.766 --> 29:16.633
Someone on the inside.

29:16.700 --> 29:18.301
I'll work on a warrant.

29:18.369 --> 29:19.802
Michelle.

29:19.870 --> 29:21.771
We'll find him, ok?

29:34.017 --> 29:36.685
Hey, hey, Burke.
What's going on?

29:36.753 --> 29:40.122
Look, I told you, you'll know
when you need to know.

29:40.190 --> 29:42.324
I just want to know
what I'm getting into.

29:42.392 --> 29:44.760
All you need to know is
that it's worth it.

29:48.764 --> 29:50.198
Ok?

29:50.266 --> 29:52.667
And what happens
if someone gets in the way?

29:56.305 --> 29:58.273
I kill 'em.

30:02.911 --> 30:08.048
Rig number 960 has
officially disappeared. Bang.

30:08.115 --> 30:09.583
Looks good, huh?

30:09.651 --> 30:13.253
So, uh, the escape route.
How does that work, Len?

30:13.321 --> 30:15.389
I get directions on the fly.

30:15.456 --> 30:17.658
- Yeah? From who?
- Oh, my God,

30:17.725 --> 30:19.659
Toby, you know, you ask a lot
of questions, man.

30:19.726 --> 30:21.894
- Come on. Wouldn't you?
- No, seriously, it's like

30:21.961 --> 30:24.664
you're pushing it a little
too much. Just trust me,

30:24.731 --> 30:27.333
I'm you buddy. You want your
cut, you do whatever Burke says.

30:27.401 --> 30:29.602
You trust this guy?

30:29.670 --> 30:32.738
I don't know, Toby.
He's a pro.

30:32.806 --> 30:35.840
- We've done business before.
- It's time.

30:35.908 --> 30:37.609
Put these on.

30:40.413 --> 30:41.846
Big day today, boys.

30:41.914 --> 30:44.015
- You ready?
- Yep.

30:44.083 --> 30:48.086
Burke, when we come back here
and we do the split, it's

30:48.153 --> 30:49.954
party time for everybody, right?

30:52.124 --> 30:54.391
(Gunshot)

30:54.459 --> 30:56.393
Yeah, Lenny.

30:56.461 --> 30:58.129
Let's go.

30:58.197 --> 30:59.964
What's the matter, man?
You nervous?

31:00.032 --> 31:02.066
- No, I'm good.
- Come on, man.

31:02.134 --> 31:05.302
Party time for everybody. We're gonna
be rich. Here. This is yours.

31:05.370 --> 31:08.038
- I'm back.
- Why?

31:08.106 --> 31:10.040
We tied your centre
of operations to a series

31:10.108 --> 31:12.275
- of robberies.
- What?

31:12.343 --> 31:15.879
We're gonna need to check every
workstation for unauthorized access.

31:15.947 --> 31:17.881
Hey. Dev, go!

31:20.051 --> 31:22.385
- Let me go!
- Harlan!

31:22.453 --> 31:24.319
What the hell is going on?!

31:24.387 --> 31:26.255
Get comfy. Get up.

31:30.293 --> 31:32.261
(Rubbing his hands together)

31:32.328 --> 31:34.029
(Typing)

31:36.166 --> 31:39.068
When we get there,
I'm gonna go in alone.

31:39.136 --> 31:41.970
After five minutes, you guys
bust in with the gurney.

31:42.037 --> 31:44.939
Lenny, you know what to do. Yeah.
We have three minutes inside.

31:45.007 --> 31:47.088
Then we get back in the truck.
I get directions from our guy.

31:47.208 --> 31:48.753
He tells us where to go.

31:53.345 --> 31:56.447
So, it turns out there's a way to divert
the traffic along the escape route.

31:56.567 --> 31:57.365
Who's behind it?

31:57.485 --> 32:00.382
<i>We have a Harlan Abbott
in custody. He had control over</i>

32:00.502 --> 32:02.386
<i>- every stoplight along the route.</i>
- Sounds like our man.

32:02.454 --> 32:05.122
- Did you lean on him?
<i>- Yeah, he shut down</i>

32:05.242 --> 32:07.366
and demanded a lawyer,
but we have his laptop.

32:07.486 --> 32:09.640
Yeah. His setup was actually
quite sophisticated.

32:09.760 --> 32:12.133
He would ID emergency vehicles
and block their way, and then

32:12.253 --> 32:14.421
<i>send directions for a clean
getaway for the thieves.</i>

32:14.541 --> 32:16.382
- Where are they now?
<i>- I'm still trying to get</i>

32:16.449 --> 32:18.350
A trace on the device
they were sending to.

32:18.418 --> 32:21.320
<i>- Ok, find them. Keep me posted.</i>
- Will do.

32:28.660 --> 32:31.129
Pull around the corner.
In five minutes there'll be

32:31.196 --> 32:33.331
an emergency call.
They'll buzz you in.

32:33.399 --> 32:35.633
Five minutes.

32:35.700 --> 32:39.269
(Ambulance starting)

32:46.377 --> 32:49.813
Michelle, check it out.
I found the device

32:49.880 --> 32:52.615
that Harlan's been sending to. It's gotta
be the one that Toby saw with Len.

32:52.683 --> 32:55.651
I've got a position. They're
near Dufferin and Oakwood,

32:55.718 --> 32:58.120
- but they're not moving.
- Ok. What's close by?

32:58.188 --> 33:00.222
- There's a first Toronto bank.
- No,

33:00.290 --> 33:02.758
they're not set up for a bank
heist. That's not their M.O.

33:02.826 --> 33:05.527
Ok, how about this? They're around the
corner from a JB's Jewelry Exchange.

33:05.595 --> 33:07.529
Here's the street view.

33:07.597 --> 33:09.865
- That fits Toby's description.
- You know, if I can

33:09.933 --> 33:13.668
connect with them, they'll think it's still Harlan.
Maybe I can lead them into a trap.

33:13.735 --> 33:16.104
Ok, do it. Is there any way
to send Toby a message

33:16.172 --> 33:18.940
without blowing his cover?

33:19.008 --> 33:21.109
Yeah, let me see what I can do.

33:31.353 --> 33:33.287
(Keypad beeping)

33:33.355 --> 33:35.122
(Door buzzer)

33:50.170 --> 33:52.538
Mr. Carter.

33:52.606 --> 33:55.141
You said you were looking
to make a rather large purchase.

33:55.209 --> 33:57.510
We are happy to facilitate that.

33:57.577 --> 34:00.479
My store's opening next month.
I don't need to see anything

34:00.546 --> 34:03.882
under half carat, but I'm willing to
go as far up as seven. All shapes.

34:03.949 --> 34:07.085
Colour I to J.
Clarity SI1

34:07.153 --> 34:08.786
to SI2.

34:08.853 --> 34:12.424
Well, you will find that all
of our gems are fully certified.

34:14.626 --> 34:17.328
We deal with over 200
of the finest cutters

34:17.396 --> 34:20.431
throughout Europe.

34:20.498 --> 34:22.599
That is beautiful.

34:22.667 --> 34:24.301
Thank you.

34:24.369 --> 34:27.304
I trust a...
(Burke clears his throat.)

34:27.371 --> 34:31.373
Excuse me. I trust a cash
transaction would be suitable?

34:31.442 --> 34:33.643
More than suitable.
(Burke coughing)

34:33.710 --> 34:35.712
Mr. Carter?
(Burke gasping)

34:35.780 --> 34:37.648
Mr. Carter!
I think it's heart attack.

34:37.715 --> 34:39.750
Well, then call 911!
Mr. Carter!

34:39.817 --> 34:41.784
Mr. Carter. Get some water!

34:41.853 --> 34:44.154
Mr. Carter!

34:46.924 --> 34:51.060
Something's wrong, man. I'm not getting
anything from our secret weapon.

34:51.127 --> 34:53.963
(Tablet beeping)
Oh, there he is.

34:54.031 --> 34:56.732
"Hope your guy has
mad skillz."

34:58.869 --> 35:01.236
Mad skillz. That's me.

35:01.304 --> 35:03.972
Time's up, man.

35:08.277 --> 35:09.878
Oh, God.

35:12.982 --> 35:15.984
- Cardiac arrest?
- You guys are fast.

35:16.052 --> 35:17.953
Yeah, we were
in the neighbourhood. What have

35:18.020 --> 35:20.287
- we got going on here, sir?
- He just collapsed.

35:20.354 --> 35:22.856
He had trouble talking,
and then he just...

35:22.976 --> 35:23.602
Face down!

35:23.722 --> 35:26.393
- Put your hands up!
- Everybody, face down!

35:26.461 --> 35:30.064
- Down! Down! Got one secure.
(Toby): - Everybody stay calm.

35:30.131 --> 35:31.765
Tie him up! Tie him up!

35:34.469 --> 35:37.436
A minute and a half.
All right, I got 'em tied up.

35:37.504 --> 35:40.172
Come on, let's get
some jewels. Let's go!

35:40.240 --> 35:43.610
Keep your head, man!
Don't be stupid, tough guy.

35:43.677 --> 35:47.580
I'm gonna take this
for my special lady.

35:47.648 --> 35:49.281
Sixty seconds.

35:51.283 --> 35:55.120
Hey, hey, it's gonna be ok,
all right?

35:55.187 --> 35:57.089
I got some more!
I got some more! Give me my bag!

35:57.156 --> 35:58.690
Give me my bag!

36:02.228 --> 36:04.630
Shh.

36:06.599 --> 36:09.066
Let's go!
All this money.

36:09.134 --> 36:11.502
Thank you so much, guys.
It was great doing business

36:11.569 --> 36:14.005
with all of you.
Turn your head, lady.

36:14.072 --> 36:16.007
You didn't see nothing, ok?

36:16.074 --> 36:18.375
Hope you have insurance.

36:27.908 --> 36:28.828
Bag.

36:28.948 --> 36:32.221
One sec, one sec.
Here you go, brother.

36:32.289 --> 36:35.525
(Tablet beeping)

36:35.592 --> 36:37.527
We're clear all the way
down Northern.

36:37.594 --> 36:39.427
Stab it and steer. Let's go!

36:43.099 --> 36:45.134
(Siren)

36:54.277 --> 36:57.344
(Tablet beeping)
Left on Kennedy.

36:57.412 --> 37:00.715
- All right.
- Watch it.

37:00.783 --> 37:04.018
(Siren) Kill the siren.

37:04.086 --> 37:07.088
(Siren stops.)

37:07.156 --> 37:08.589
What's next?

37:08.657 --> 37:10.992
I don't know.
One second.

37:11.060 --> 37:13.860
Head due right... heh.

37:13.928 --> 37:15.862
Uh...
(Tablet beeping)

37:15.930 --> 37:17.364
Take the next right.

37:17.432 --> 37:19.733
- Cool.
- Where are we going?

37:19.801 --> 37:22.369
- I don't know.
- Why aren't we taking the cit...

37:22.437 --> 37:26.039
I don't know, Burke! I'm following
directions! That's your guy. Next right.

37:30.544 --> 37:32.412
Michelle: <i>Are they responding
to your coordinates?</i>

37:32.479 --> 37:34.113
Oh, are they ever!

37:34.181 --> 37:36.216
These guys are gonna have
a big surprise when they get

37:36.283 --> 37:37.817
around the next corner.

37:44.490 --> 37:47.792
(Toby): - What the hell is this?
- Hold your position!

37:47.860 --> 37:49.861
(Michelle): - Hold your fire!
(Burke): - Reverse!

37:49.929 --> 37:52.130
(Siren)

37:52.198 --> 37:54.499
Len!
The road's blocked.

37:54.567 --> 37:57.168
- Yeah, no kidding.
- Let's go! Let's move!

37:57.237 --> 37:59.838
- Go through them.
- Come on, you kidding me?

37:59.905 --> 38:03.574
- Do it! Now!
- Ok, all right. Ok.

38:05.611 --> 38:07.712
Drive!

38:12.351 --> 38:14.652
- He's gonna ram us!
- I got a shot!

38:17.521 --> 38:20.390
- Now! Move!
- Move! Move!

38:20.510 --> 38:21.371
No, the driver's one of ours!

38:21.491 --> 38:23.393
- Easy. Easy. Hey.
- Down! Down! Down!

38:23.461 --> 38:25.262
Get down! He has a gun!

38:25.329 --> 38:27.364
- Just hold it!
- What?

38:27.431 --> 38:29.099
- Drop the weapon!
- Son of a bitch!

38:29.219 --> 38:30.581
Down!
Put the gun down!

38:30.701 --> 38:32.668
Move, move, move!

38:32.736 --> 38:34.670
Come on.

38:34.738 --> 38:37.106
Back up! Don't you move!

38:37.174 --> 38:39.575
- Hold your fire!
- Back up! Toby, let's go!

38:39.643 --> 38:41.744
Let's go, buddy, come on!
Let's go!

38:41.812 --> 38:44.380
Lenny, put the gun down!
It's over. Don't shoot him.

38:44.447 --> 38:46.816
- Hold you fire!
- It's over, Lenny.

38:46.884 --> 38:49.417
Are you one of them, Toby?

38:50.953 --> 38:52.388
Ha!

38:52.455 --> 38:55.391
Toby, you snitched on me?

38:55.458 --> 38:59.061
Man, the one guy,
the one guy I thought would

38:59.128 --> 39:01.644
always have my back, Toby.
We're like brothers you and me.

39:01.764 --> 39:03.931
We were. I couldn't go
down this path.

39:03.999 --> 39:06.300
Man, I trusted you, Toby!
I gave you love!

39:06.367 --> 39:08.836
I gave you love, Toby,
and this is how you repay me?

39:08.904 --> 39:10.337
You set me up!

39:10.405 --> 39:12.539
Back up!
He was gonna shoot us!

39:12.607 --> 39:16.343
- Burke was gonna kill us!
- Is that right, Burke?

39:16.411 --> 39:18.979
It's over, Lenny.

39:21.582 --> 39:23.516
It's over, man.

39:23.584 --> 39:25.118
Put it down.

39:29.090 --> 39:31.725
(Crying): I trusted you, Toby.

39:31.792 --> 39:34.594
I'm sorry.

39:34.661 --> 39:36.195
I had to.

39:51.611 --> 39:54.378
Hey. You did good.

39:54.446 --> 39:56.981
Ok?

40:02.121 --> 40:04.155
(Siren)

40:06.558 --> 40:08.491
(Police radio chatter)

40:08.559 --> 40:11.094
(Music playing)

40:11.162 --> 40:13.764
(Tia): I was starting to think
this dinner would never happen.

40:13.831 --> 40:16.933
Well, that's what happens when you
date an international man of mystery.

40:17.001 --> 40:19.970
I don't know about "international",
but I'm glad to be myself again.

40:20.037 --> 40:22.105
- The girls are gonna love you.
- Thank you.

40:22.173 --> 40:23.693
(Oz): This is quite
the spread you got here.

40:23.813 --> 40:25.255
Here we are.
One for you.

40:25.375 --> 40:27.376
- Oh, thank you.
- Thank you.

40:27.443 --> 40:29.478
Just one though. I'm not gonna
join you for dinner. I gotta...

40:29.545 --> 40:31.590
- Sit down for a sec.
- Sure, thanks.

40:31.710 --> 40:35.116
Hey, uh, I want to say I apologize
I couldn't make it to Pronto,

40:35.184 --> 40:37.952
but I'm super happy that you guys
were able to make it to my house.

40:38.020 --> 40:40.046
I hope we have a great dinner.
Nice to meet you.

40:40.166 --> 40:40.903
Cheers.

40:41.023 --> 40:43.525
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

40:43.593 --> 40:45.327
All right.

40:45.395 --> 40:47.328
Why don't we sit down?
So, Toby.

40:47.396 --> 40:49.297
- Yeah?
- What's your family like?

40:49.364 --> 40:51.465
Wow.
(Laughing)

40:51.585 --> 40:52.546
I told you.

40:52.666 --> 40:55.169
Ok. I can't believe
she just went for that.

40:55.236 --> 40:57.070
Do you have any brothers
or sisters?

40:57.138 --> 40:58.939
Or a grandmother
with a vintage wedding ring

40:59.007 --> 41:01.409
- tucked away somewhere?
- Catrin!

41:01.476 --> 41:03.910
- Cutting to the chase.
- Tia. Tia. It's ok. All right,

41:03.977 --> 41:07.314
look, I have no brothers,
no sisters. No family, really.

41:07.381 --> 41:10.350
I graduated high school,
I went to college...

41:10.418 --> 41:12.385
that was fun... 
nd, uh,

41:12.453 --> 41:14.521
- I got a paramedic diploma.
- And now

41:14.588 --> 41:17.324
- you're an undercover cop?
- Special Consultant.

41:17.391 --> 41:20.226
- My friend is a man of many talents.
- Sounds like there's more

41:20.294 --> 41:22.295
- to that story.
- All right, actually,

41:22.362 --> 41:25.097
we have a great cheese spread
that we can get for you ladies.

41:25.165 --> 41:27.333
- Do you want me to top you up?
- No. I'm good, thank you.

41:27.400 --> 41:29.869
- Don't want to drink too much?
- Not unless you want to carry her home.

41:29.937 --> 41:31.971
- Catrin!
- Sorry.

41:32.039 --> 41:35.874
There's a story there,
isn't there? What's the story?

41:35.942 --> 41:38.109
- Yup.
(Oz): - Boy, this is great wine.

41:38.177 --> 41:39.978
It's really good. Really...
(Laughing)

41:40.046 --> 41:43.448
I meant the bouquet.
Is that a... thing?

41:43.515 --> 41:45.450
I should have
told you this before.

41:45.517 --> 41:48.186
- Mm-hmm?
- Um, I have epilepsy.

41:48.254 --> 41:50.555
My medication has it
under control.

41:50.622 --> 41:54.291
They say that it calms the
electrical storms in my brain.

41:54.359 --> 41:56.760
Sadly, it also magnifies
the effects of alcohol,

41:56.828 --> 41:59.596
so that I have to limit myself
to one. That's all.

41:59.664 --> 42:02.066
Ok.

42:02.133 --> 42:04.534
- You ok?
- Yeah.

42:04.602 --> 42:08.637
I just don't want us
to have any secrets.

42:11.608 --> 42:14.077
All right, Oz,
help me out, please,

42:14.144 --> 42:16.545
- with the cheese.
- Oh. Yeah, I can help.

42:16.613 --> 42:18.647
Kissing her on the forehead?
That's weird.

42:18.715 --> 42:21.450
- She has epilepsy.
- Yeah, I heard. So?

42:21.518 --> 42:23.919
So maybe the way
that her brain is wired...

42:23.987 --> 42:26.221
The electrical storms... maybe
that's why I can't read her.

42:26.289 --> 42:28.490
So it's all good then.
Except for the epilepsy.

42:28.557 --> 42:30.592
Or maybe the medication
suppresses the part of the brain

42:30.659 --> 42:34.363
that I can read, and if she ever goes
off of them, it could ruin everything.

42:34.430 --> 42:37.599
Or a meteor could take out
all life on earth, Toby.

42:37.666 --> 42:40.101
You can't keep looking
for excuses to not be with her.

42:40.168 --> 42:42.904
Ok? This could be the one.

42:42.971 --> 42:45.406
(Tia's friends laughing)

42:45.473 --> 42:47.909
All right.
Thanks for the pep talk.

42:47.976 --> 42:49.610
Grab your cheese.

42:49.677 --> 42:51.112
Anyway, thank you.

42:51.179 --> 42:52.880
Hey. Cheese,

42:52.948 --> 42:55.548
and a virgin cocktail
for the lady.

42:55.616 --> 42:57.050
Little bit of sugar...

42:57.118 --> 42:59.118

feeding the cast and crew

43:48.032 --> 43:50.367

The winning team is

43:52.703 --> 43:54.171
[Cheering]

43:54.205 --> 43:56.773

team was crushed...

43:56.807 --> 43:58.608
You got destroyed.

43:58.642 --> 44:01.010
(Narrator) It was time for another
painstaking pressure test.

44:01.044 --> 44:02.878
When Krissi targeted
Bime for elimination...

44:02.912 --> 44:04.280
What have you done here?

44:04.314 --> 44:05.614
(Narrator) And hit her target.

44:05.648 --> 44:07.850
It's time to take
that apron off.

44:07.884 --> 44:10.686
(Narrator) Tonight it's a
shocking mystery box challenge.

44:10.720 --> 44:12.054
Oh, my God.

44:12.089 --> 44:15.023
There are children
who will not sleep tonight.

44:15.057 --> 44:18.159
