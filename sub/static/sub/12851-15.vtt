00:06.707 --> 00:08.774
-Happy Halloween, everybody!
-No.

00:08.776 --> 00:11.210
-What do you mean, no?
-We outgrew it, Matthews.

00:11.212 --> 00:13.178
-No Halloween no more?
-We decided. We had a meeting.

00:13.180 --> 00:15.047
-There was no meeting.
-That was just me?

00:15.049 --> 00:17.049
We're in high school now,
Mr. Matthews.

00:17.051 --> 00:19.218
-We grew up.
-Time to outgrow
weird masks and costumes.

00:19.220 --> 00:21.186
We're not
trick or treating
anymore.

00:21.188 --> 00:23.522
Small potatoes, Matthews.
Not important. Move on.

00:23.524 --> 00:26.291
Not important? Well...

00:26.293 --> 00:28.827
Corey and Maya:
You've brought us
to today's lesson!

00:28.829 --> 00:30.129
(sobs)
I didn't mean to!

00:30.131 --> 00:33.198
There are no
small decisions in life.

00:33.200 --> 00:36.735
Every decision that you make
affects who you are,

00:36.737 --> 00:40.539
and every action
you take or don't take
has consequences,

00:40.541 --> 00:42.307
and it affects
the people around you.

00:42.309 --> 00:44.176
We get it, Dad.
People change people.

00:44.178 --> 00:45.978
What if they never
got the chance?

00:45.980 --> 00:47.212
What?

00:47.214 --> 00:49.548
So, you've made
a decision about Halloween.

00:49.550 --> 00:51.383
"Small potatoes," you say.

00:51.385 --> 00:53.152
"Not important," you say.

00:54.321 --> 00:55.487
Are we important?

00:55.489 --> 00:56.655
Yes.

00:56.657 --> 00:57.723
No.

00:57.725 --> 01:00.025
(chuckles)
No. You think so,
but no. No!

01:00.027 --> 01:02.161
No. No.

01:02.163 --> 01:03.762
No...

01:04.832 --> 01:06.331
Save me, Farkle.

01:06.333 --> 01:07.833
He's talking chaos theory.

01:07.835 --> 01:11.870
A mathematical hypothesis
postulating that within
our universal complexity

01:11.872 --> 01:14.273
any small alterations
can have vast repercussions.

01:14.275 --> 01:16.575
-You brainiac!
-You brainiac!

01:18.546 --> 01:22.581
I'm not sure anyone understands
what you said. Explain it
for the common person.

01:22.583 --> 01:25.451
You do something over here,
it can affect what
happens over there!

01:26.520 --> 01:28.087
Demonstrate.

01:29.256 --> 01:31.423
-Over here.
-Hey!

01:31.425 --> 01:33.692
-Over there.
-(laughs)

01:35.429 --> 01:38.197
-It's for science, Lucas.
-Thanks, Riles.

01:38.199 --> 01:39.631

Only I call her "Riles."

01:39.633 --> 01:42.301
-Okay, Peaches.
-Only I call her "Peaches."

01:42.303 --> 01:46.238
But the relationship
that matters most is
you and me, right?

01:46.240 --> 01:48.373
(students muttering)

01:50.244 --> 01:52.444
Hey, we don't make
the rules around here.

01:52.446 --> 01:56.548
Wait. Yes we do. And if we don't
wanna do Halloween,
we don't gotta do Halloween!

05:05.406 --> 05:07.739
-Isaac Newton!
-Gravity, sir!

05:07.741 --> 05:09.641
He sat under a tree,
apple fell on his head.

05:09.643 --> 05:12.377
He said, "Hey, Gravity!"
Thank you, I am Farkle!

05:14.448 --> 05:15.514
But you're not just talking

05:15.516 --> 05:17.316
about science gravity,
right, Daddy?

05:17.318 --> 05:19.618
You're talking about
the gravity of our lives!

05:19.620 --> 05:21.920
No, I mean gravity.

05:21.922 --> 05:24.356
History class is not
about poetry.

05:24.358 --> 05:25.624
Names and dates.

05:25.626 --> 05:28.427
History is a collection
of names and dates.

05:28.429 --> 05:30.962
Isaac Newton.
Born 1643. Died 1727.

05:30.964 --> 05:33.765
Correct. And that's what
makes you so smart.

05:33.767 --> 05:36.034
Smarter than my arch-nemesis,
Back-Of-The-Class Smackle?

05:39.840 --> 05:42.374
Hey. Do I have something on me?

05:42.376 --> 05:45.444
Oh. Ha, ha.
This is a funny game
that me and Maya play.

05:45.446 --> 05:47.512
Okay, Maya.
I'll do one at you now.

05:51.485 --> 05:54.286
<i>(ominous music plays)</i>

06:00.661 --> 06:02.627
No hats in class, Mr. Friar.

06:02.629 --> 06:04.529
(coldly)
I am my hat, teacher-man.

06:04.531 --> 06:07.733
Hey, Friar. You as tough
as everyone thinks you are?

06:07.735 --> 06:09.468
Hey, Hart. Are you?

06:09.470 --> 06:11.036
(bell rings)

06:12.206 --> 06:14.239
Hey, Daddy!

06:14.241 --> 06:16.742
Did you ever think that
our being together in a class
like history is actually

06:16.744 --> 06:20.979
a wonderful opportunity
for you to teach me and
all of my friends about life?

06:20.981 --> 06:22.748
(mockingly)
"All of my friends."

06:24.985 --> 06:27.986
No. Names and dates.

06:27.988 --> 06:30.389
Names and dates are
the secret of life, Riley.

06:30.391 --> 06:31.623
Okay. Thank you.

06:42.669 --> 06:44.903
You got something
for me, Matthews?

06:44.905 --> 06:47.572
This will get you a C+,
just like you asked!

06:50.244 --> 06:53.345
Hey, why do you always make me
do your homework for you?

06:53.347 --> 06:54.913
Are you my bully?

06:54.915 --> 06:57.849
"Don't take away
my lunch money,
Bully McGee!"

06:59.420 --> 07:00.652
Okay.

07:01.722 --> 07:03.488
I don't want
your money, bowhead.

07:03.490 --> 07:05.624
Then why do you pick on me?

07:05.626 --> 07:09.261
How can I not?
You're a strange duck, Matthews.

07:09.263 --> 07:13.098
(snorts)
I'm a strange duck. Quack!

07:14.935 --> 07:16.802
Hey. This looks
better than usual.

07:16.804 --> 07:18.603
You're sure this is a C+?

07:18.605 --> 07:20.639
It might be a B-.

07:20.641 --> 07:23.775
I told you never a B-.
Why would you do that?

07:23.777 --> 07:29.047
Because... you're smarter
than you want people to believe,
Maya. Why would you do that?

07:29.049 --> 07:31.483
When I say C+,
I mean C+.

07:31.485 --> 07:33.084
Nobody cares
about a C+.

07:33.086 --> 07:35.787
The minute I start
to get a B-, teachers
think I have potential.

07:35.789 --> 07:39.057
They'd start to call on me.
I wouldn't like that.

07:39.059 --> 07:40.826
I would blame somebody for that.

07:40.828 --> 07:43.061
You do have potential, Maya.

07:43.063 --> 07:46.064
What you don't have is
a good influence. Quack!

07:51.905 --> 07:54.973
If he ever calls on me,
you're finished.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.808
(menacingly) Quack.

07:59.346 --> 08:01.980
-Lucas: You gonna let her
talk to you like that?
-Who said that?

08:05.686 --> 08:07.552
I'm gonna tell you
a scary story.

08:11.758 --> 08:13.758
(screams)

08:15.596 --> 08:20.665
In this world,
there are wolves
and there are sheep.

08:20.667 --> 08:24.769
The wolves lurk
around dark corners.

08:24.771 --> 08:28.640
They start by asking you
to do their homework.

08:28.642 --> 08:33.345
But before you know it,
the wolf pounces

08:33.347 --> 08:35.213
and you end up dinner.

08:35.215 --> 08:39.251
Because there are sheep
and there are wolves.

08:40.153 --> 08:41.620
I'm a duck!

08:42.556 --> 08:44.256
I regret talking.

08:46.894 --> 08:48.660
You barely ever do,
you know.

08:48.662 --> 08:50.662
You always just
hang around by yourself.

08:50.664 --> 08:52.564
-I don't mean to pry--
-Then don't.

08:52.566 --> 08:55.133
Okay, I won't,
because you asked me not to.

08:56.069 --> 08:57.536
Why don't you have
any friends?

08:58.472 --> 09:00.872
I had a friend...
back in Texas.

09:00.874 --> 09:02.674
Do you miss him?

09:02.676 --> 09:03.909
No.

09:03.911 --> 09:05.911
(giggles)
You miss him.

09:05.913 --> 09:08.647
You miss him and that is
why you're angry all the time.

09:08.649 --> 09:10.815
Because your
best friend is a hat.

09:10.817 --> 09:12.817
This is why I don't
talk to people.

09:12.819 --> 09:15.420
Riley, wolves eat sheep.

09:15.422 --> 09:17.689
-Well, as long as they don't--
-They eat ducks, too.

09:17.691 --> 09:19.758
Yikey McShmikey!

09:20.761 --> 09:22.694
Stand up
for yourself, Riley.

09:22.696 --> 09:25.363
That's the best advice
I could give you.

09:25.365 --> 09:28.166
Why do you care
what happens to me, huh?
Why do you care?

09:28.168 --> 09:30.702
I'm not saying that
I do or I don't.

09:30.704 --> 09:35.073
But right now, you're like
a defenseless sheep,

09:35.075 --> 09:37.776
and I hate seeing
little animals get
themselves hurt.

09:37.778 --> 09:38.843
I don't know why.

09:39.780 --> 09:41.746
Maybe someday,
I might like to be a...

09:41.748 --> 09:42.881
-Zoo keeper?
-No.

09:42.883 --> 09:44.015
-Pet shop boy?
-No.

09:44.017 --> 09:45.750
-Farmer with chickies?
-No.

09:45.752 --> 09:47.752
Person who chooses
which animal sounds are going
to be in those books?

09:47.754 --> 09:49.654
-No.
-Moo!

09:50.924 --> 09:52.524
Okay.

09:57.731 --> 10:01.900
(distorted)
What if the world we lived in
was a Halloween world

10:01.902 --> 10:05.537
where everything was different,
but you didn't even know?

10:07.074 --> 10:09.040
You will not believe what
that boy did to me today!

10:09.042 --> 10:10.909
(normal voice)
I guess some things
never change.

10:10.911 --> 10:13.878
-What'd I do, Ava?
-I wanted us to wear
the same costume

10:13.880 --> 10:16.247
so everyone could see
how great we are together.

10:16.249 --> 10:17.749
Yuh-huh.

10:17.751 --> 10:20.819
But I'm a ghost!
You didn't tell me you
wanted to be butterfly.

10:20.821 --> 10:23.788
Ava, you should
really go easy on him.
He's a good little boy.

10:23.790 --> 10:25.690
Yeah, I'm a good little boy.

10:29.162 --> 10:30.929
Please don't
make me wear this.

10:30.931 --> 10:33.732
It's just not something
a Doy would do.

10:33.734 --> 10:35.133
Doy?

10:35.135 --> 10:37.002
Hey, Lovebuckets.

10:38.672 --> 10:40.071
I'm tryin' to make this work.

10:41.341 --> 10:42.807
Would ya use your real name?

10:42.809 --> 10:45.176
(scared)
Dewey! My name
is Dewey!

10:46.146 --> 10:47.712
(panicked breathing)

10:49.082 --> 10:52.450
But your name is Doy,
and I'm your Lovebuckets, Ava!

10:52.452 --> 10:53.818
Ava?

10:54.855 --> 10:56.421
Why is everyone ignoring me?

10:56.423 --> 10:58.423
You guys are really
kind of adorable.

10:58.425 --> 11:01.126
I wonder what
it would be like if Riley
had a brother or a sister?

11:01.128 --> 11:03.194
She does! It's me!

11:03.196 --> 11:04.362
Mom?

11:04.364 --> 11:05.664
Hello, Mother!

11:06.633 --> 11:08.533
Sorry I'm two minutes late.

11:08.535 --> 11:11.836
Squirrels sure are cute,
but they don't like it
when you squeeze 'em.

11:12.873 --> 11:15.607
But it's so hard no to.

11:15.609 --> 11:17.676
I'm gonna need a rabies shot.

11:20.847 --> 11:23.782
You know what?
One kid is enough.

11:26.019 --> 11:29.354
Oh no. I was never born.

11:29.356 --> 11:30.789
-(thunder crashes)
<i>-(spooky music playing)</i>

11:36.863 --> 11:38.530
I really am a ghost.

11:38.532 --> 11:41.900
Maya never met Riley,
people never changed people,

11:41.902 --> 11:45.670
Riley's crazy,
and I was never born.

11:45.672 --> 11:49.941
I want to be born!
I have to make things
the way they're supposed to be!

11:52.713 --> 11:54.412
Here's an opportunity!

11:58.018 --> 12:00.051
Stop hitting on me!

12:00.053 --> 12:02.821
I'm not hitting on you.
You're my arch-nemesis.
Also, what is "hit on you"?

12:02.823 --> 12:03.788
Why would I ever hit on you?

12:04.891 --> 12:06.958
Because this is why.

12:12.933 --> 12:14.499
Ahh!

12:14.501 --> 12:16.134
-What the...?
-Ahh...

12:17.070 --> 12:19.771
(sneezes)

12:22.409 --> 12:23.742
Thank you.

12:24.711 --> 12:25.844
Goodbye.

12:26.847 --> 12:28.580
Well, that didn't
go well at all.

12:29.516 --> 12:30.582
Oh!

12:34.221 --> 12:39.958
Have you ever thought that
you and I could be something
more than arch-nemeseses?

12:39.960 --> 12:42.594
Taking over the world is
a one-person operation, Smackle.

12:43.630 --> 12:45.463
That seems lonely.

12:47.567 --> 12:49.300
Well, I don't see
any solution to that.

13:02.149 --> 13:05.150
Okay. There's only one way
to make this right.

13:05.152 --> 13:07.886
I need to go back
to where it all began!

13:07.888 --> 13:10.822
But how could I do that
unless I was a real ghost?

13:12.926 --> 13:13.992
Oh yeah!

13:19.299 --> 13:21.966
♪ Do, do, do,
doodalee, doodalee, doo ♪

13:24.137 --> 13:29.040
Doodalee,
doodalee, doo...

13:30.443 --> 13:31.843
Here we go!

13:34.114 --> 13:36.948
-Why'd you ask me to come here?
-I didn't ask you to come here.

13:36.950 --> 13:41.553
Then what's this note that
suddenly appeared in my pocket?

13:44.191 --> 13:46.624
-"Dear Peaches..."
-Why would you call me
"Peaches"?

13:46.626 --> 13:49.994
Nobody calls me Peaches.
Why would you call me Peaches?

13:49.996 --> 13:53.298
"Please come through my window
and make everything right."

13:53.300 --> 13:55.166
What does that mean,
strange duck?

13:55.168 --> 13:57.702
I don't know.
I didn't write it.

13:57.704 --> 13:59.704
Although, it does seem like
something I would write,

13:59.706 --> 14:00.939
especially to you.

14:00.941 --> 14:02.340
Why to me?

14:02.342 --> 14:05.210
Because you were meant
to be best friends, that's why!

14:05.212 --> 14:07.679
-Thunder! Lightning!
-(thunder crashes)

14:09.683 --> 14:10.915
Whoa.

14:11.885 --> 14:13.618
Nice place you got.

14:13.620 --> 14:15.186
Spend a lot of time here?

14:15.188 --> 14:17.889
-Not really.
-Why not?

14:17.891 --> 14:21.459
Because whenever
I sit here I get...
lonely.

14:23.063 --> 14:25.096
Lucas told me that
I shouldn't let you
boss me around...

14:26.132 --> 14:28.066
that I should
stand up to you.

14:28.068 --> 14:30.134
Yeah? You got that
in you, Quacky?

14:30.136 --> 14:32.737
-No.
-Why not?

14:32.739 --> 14:35.340
Because... I don't think
that you're a wolf.

14:35.342 --> 14:36.875
Why not?

14:36.877 --> 14:38.710
Because I think something
happened in your life

14:38.712 --> 14:39.978
that made you
the way you are.

14:41.248 --> 14:43.481
Maybe you're angry because
you have nobody to tell.

14:43.483 --> 14:46.084
-I've plenty
of people to tell.
-I don't think so.

14:47.254 --> 14:48.453
Hello!

14:49.856 --> 14:52.357
Let me make something
real clear to you right now.

14:52.359 --> 14:55.093
My life is none
of your business.

14:55.095 --> 14:57.395
You have no right
to talk to me like that.

14:57.397 --> 14:59.797
You have no right
to talk to me at all.

15:01.067 --> 15:03.334
(spooky music playing)

15:07.774 --> 15:09.540
Oh no!

15:09.542 --> 15:12.110
Am I fading away?

15:16.016 --> 15:21.920
My daughter suggested
that events of history can have
an effect on individual lives,

15:21.922 --> 15:23.955
as if things happen
for a reason

15:23.957 --> 15:26.758
and the world is more
than names and dates.

15:26.760 --> 15:28.459
What do you think?

15:28.461 --> 15:30.461
Is this worth
our consideration?

15:31.398 --> 15:32.597
Ms. Hart?

15:32.599 --> 15:34.632
-You called on me.
-Uh-oh!

15:36.136 --> 15:38.169
-Why would you call on me?
-Uh-oh!

15:39.472 --> 15:41.105
B-, Ms. Hart.

15:41.107 --> 15:42.440
Uh-oh!

15:43.910 --> 15:46.311
Three o'clock.
Hallway.

15:48.081 --> 15:49.047
(whispers)
Uh-oh.

15:50.951 --> 15:53.618
(distorted)
This is Halloween
Scary Time Theater for real.

15:53.620 --> 15:56.054
I've always enjoyed
being your ghost,

15:56.056 --> 15:58.222
and now I am very scared.

15:58.224 --> 16:02.493
I am August Matthews,
and I really want to be here.

16:13.773 --> 16:16.140
School's over, you know.

16:16.142 --> 16:18.176
Do you ever feel
like everything's
going wrong in the world

16:18.178 --> 16:20.178
and it's all your fault,
but you don't know why?

16:20.180 --> 16:21.212
Every day.

16:23.416 --> 16:25.283
Do you think that there
could be another world

16:25.285 --> 16:28.086
where history isn't just
about names and dates?

16:28.088 --> 16:30.021
Yes, I've thought
about it, Riley,

16:30.023 --> 16:32.290
because you asked me to,

16:32.292 --> 16:33.524
and that's important.

16:33.526 --> 16:35.626
What if that's
a better world?

16:35.628 --> 16:39.931
Well, let's see.
Sir Isaac Newton.
Is he important?

16:39.933 --> 16:45.503
Yes. We are all important.
And he discovered gravity.

16:47.040 --> 16:49.440
Make me see why that's
important to me, Dad.

16:49.442 --> 16:50.842
I know you can do it.

16:53.513 --> 16:55.380
Well, I've always believed
in the world, Riley.

16:57.550 --> 17:01.219
And that there's a force in it
strong enough to keep us
from flying away.

17:02.722 --> 17:05.723
I believe that force knows
how to hold on to us...

17:05.725 --> 17:07.358
and to you.

17:07.360 --> 17:11.696
Thank you, Dad.
That changes me.

17:13.299 --> 17:15.967
That changes you?

17:15.969 --> 17:19.370
That you care enough
to show me that history is
more than names and dates.

17:20.306 --> 17:21.739
I'll never forget it.

17:23.309 --> 17:24.409
You won't?

17:24.411 --> 17:25.943
(chuckles)

17:32.152 --> 17:34.085
I feel changed myself.

17:44.197 --> 17:47.165
(chalk scratching)

18:05.585 --> 18:07.618
People seem
to change people.

18:20.800 --> 18:25.203
Goodbye, Mom. You were
the best mom I never had.

18:29.976 --> 18:31.442
Goodbye, couch.

18:31.444 --> 18:34.212
I'm sorry
I made crumbs on you.

18:34.214 --> 18:36.948
I just wanted you
to have some.

18:40.386 --> 18:42.386
Goodbye, fireplace.

18:42.388 --> 18:44.856
I didn't even know we had you.

18:45.959 --> 18:48.226
That's it! We're through!

18:48.228 --> 18:49.627
We were a thing?

18:49.629 --> 18:51.229
What happened?

18:51.231 --> 18:53.231
-Say "turtle."
-"Tut-ull."

18:53.233 --> 18:55.032
I just can't anymore.

18:56.169 --> 18:58.736
-Say "hippopotamus."
-"Popopamoose."

18:58.738 --> 19:01.906
So what do I do?
Write him a letter?
You do it.

19:01.908 --> 19:04.375
Let him down gently.
I'm tired.

19:06.346 --> 19:09.580
So, that's it? It's over?
No more me and you?

19:09.582 --> 19:12.917
No more! Have a great
rest of your life with you
and your "tut-ull."

19:12.919 --> 19:14.285
(breathing excitedly)

19:14.287 --> 19:17.088
Oh, great. This.
(breathing excitedly)

19:20.493 --> 19:21.559
But...

19:22.629 --> 19:26.531
Wonderful.
Do you have any cheese?

19:26.533 --> 19:29.300
I'm no good alone.

19:29.302 --> 19:30.368
(cries)

19:30.370 --> 19:32.370
How was that?

19:43.316 --> 19:45.583
Goodbye, Ava.
I love you.

19:48.388 --> 19:49.954
Did you say something?

19:49.956 --> 19:51.189
No.

19:51.191 --> 19:52.423
Oh.

20:01.501 --> 20:04.302
(wolves howling)

20:08.408 --> 20:10.508
Yeah, I gotta say, bowhead,

20:10.510 --> 20:12.843
not a lot of people would be
on time for this party.

20:12.845 --> 20:14.312
Well, than they're rude.

20:15.582 --> 20:19.483
How can you possibly look
at someone like me
and see a B-?

20:19.485 --> 20:21.252
I see better than that.

20:27.260 --> 20:29.193
-Sit down!
-I'm not sitting next to you.

20:29.195 --> 20:31.362
-Sit down.
-I'm not sitting next to you,
I'm Maya Hart.

20:31.364 --> 20:32.463
Sit down!

20:34.667 --> 20:36.334
Okay. Now you talk to me.

20:36.336 --> 20:38.936
No. I throw stuff at you
and make you do my homework.

20:38.938 --> 20:40.571
Nope. Now you talk to me.

20:40.573 --> 20:41.939
Why?

20:41.941 --> 20:43.441
Because I'm a good listener.

20:44.844 --> 20:47.211
Maybe there's
something we could say that
would change each other.

20:47.213 --> 20:48.412
I don't wanna change.

20:49.582 --> 20:51.349
I heard that
your father's gone.

20:52.518 --> 20:53.618
I'm a really good listener.

20:56.923 --> 20:58.422
I know you're here,
cowboy.

21:02.395 --> 21:05.963
Maybe you're right.
So maybe I'm not as tough
as people think I am.

21:05.965 --> 21:11.168
Maybe I don't want to be.
Ya happy, you-you--
you huckleberry?

21:13.306 --> 21:14.972
You were there
the whole time?

21:14.974 --> 21:18.309
I just felt like
I wasn't supposed
to let anything happen.

21:19.912 --> 21:22.146
You think she needs
protecting from me?

21:23.283 --> 21:24.348
Maybe not anymore.

21:28.321 --> 21:30.554
So... Farkle.

21:30.556 --> 21:32.490
Yes, Smackle?

21:32.492 --> 21:35.226
Do you think that some day

21:35.228 --> 21:38.496
you and I could be something
more than arch-nemeseses?

21:38.498 --> 21:40.731
How do you propose
that that happen?

21:42.769 --> 21:44.135
Ahh...

21:44.137 --> 21:47.505
ahh... sneeze.

21:50.443 --> 21:52.043
Okay.
(chuckles)

21:54.180 --> 21:55.846
(thunder crashes)

21:55.848 --> 21:57.248
Thunder.

21:58.518 --> 22:00.084
Lightning.

22:12.932 --> 22:15.599
Auggie? What are you
doing in my school?

22:15.601 --> 22:17.501
You see me?

22:17.503 --> 22:19.470
-Who's this?
-My kid brother.

22:19.472 --> 22:23.541
I am? I was born? Yay!

22:23.543 --> 22:26.310
And now you're dead.
(sarcastically) Yay!

22:26.312 --> 22:29.513
-Auggie: Yay...!
-Come back!

22:45.531 --> 22:46.697
Riley, what are you doing?

22:48.334 --> 22:50.668
-Don't you know what today is?
-It's the first day of Spring,

22:50.670 --> 22:52.870
-and it's beautiful outside.
-Yeah.

22:52.872 --> 22:54.472
Open a window, kiddo.

22:55.842 --> 22:57.174
Smell the flowers.

22:57.176 --> 22:58.976
(sniffs)

22:58.978 --> 23:01.312
Yeah. Now the butterflies
can come in to play.

23:01.314 --> 23:02.446
Yay!

23:04.751 --> 23:07.318
♪ Do, do, do ♪

23:07.320 --> 23:09.754
♪ Doodalee, doodalee, do ♪

23:15.495 --> 23:16.761
S'up?
