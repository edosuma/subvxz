00:19.467 --> 00:20.832
Wait, don't do it.
Don't do it.

00:20.833 --> 00:22.166
Don't do it.

00:22.167 --> 00:23.767
Don't you see? This is exactly
what they want.

00:23.768 --> 00:24.899
I gave you a chance.

00:24.900 --> 00:26.166
Please.

00:26.167 --> 00:28.067
I had no choice.

01:01.634 --> 01:03.266
Stop it! Stop. Please.

01:03.267 --> 01:04.400
Please.

01:04.400 --> 01:06.534
Jeffrey...

01:06.601 --> 01:08.668
there's so much more
that I want to do.

01:08.734 --> 01:10.701
To feel.

01:12.067 --> 01:13.967
Ah-ha!
You're loathsome.

01:15.701 --> 01:18.034
Just about enough
of you two morons.

01:18.100 --> 01:19.899
You knocked over
a customer.

01:19.900 --> 01:21.600
You...

01:21.601 --> 01:23.668
fat and drunk and stupid.

01:23.734 --> 01:26.668
Together you constitute a clear
and present danger to the store.

01:26.734 --> 01:28.066
Who needs to be neutralized.

01:28.067 --> 01:31.367
You know, John, I know
you like to play make-believe,

01:31.434 --> 01:33.401
that you're some kind
of military tough guy,

01:33.467 --> 01:35.367
but the truth is
that you're just

01:35.401 --> 01:39.067
a schmuck that works
in an electronics store.

01:39.134 --> 01:40.733
With us.

01:40.734 --> 01:42.933
Well, I guess you didn't hear
that Big Mike sent Morgan

01:43.000 --> 01:44.933
down to El Segundo
for a management seminar

01:45.000 --> 01:46.633
for the next three days,

01:46.634 --> 01:48.601
leaving me in charge
as assistant manager.

01:48.668 --> 01:49.799
What a special moment for you.

01:49.800 --> 01:51.933
I assume, then, that
you've been made aware

01:52.000 --> 01:54.768
of the "no touching" policy
here at the store.

01:54.833 --> 01:56.600
Granted, it's mostly
for Jeff,

01:56.601 --> 01:58.567
but it holds company-wide,
friend.

01:58.634 --> 02:00.333
Don't you see, Johnny,

02:00.334 --> 02:02.166
you can't harm us.

02:02.167 --> 02:03.433
Thanks to the rules

02:03.434 --> 02:07.200
of the very corporate system
that you so admire.

02:07.267 --> 02:08.532
Ha!

02:08.533 --> 02:10.434
The irony!

02:11.567 --> 02:12.667
I love irony.

02:12.668 --> 02:14.568
Well...

02:17.334 --> 02:18.999
Casey, what did you just do?

02:19.000 --> 02:20.233
What are you
still doing here?

02:20.234 --> 02:21.566
I thought you clocked out.
Yeah.

02:21.567 --> 02:23.233
Yeah, I did, but I thought
I'd take a second

02:23.234 --> 02:24.832
to see how you were adjusting
to civilian life.

02:24.833 --> 02:26.333
Apparently,
not that great.

02:26.334 --> 02:27.533
Baby steps.

02:27.534 --> 02:29.467
More like baby kicks
to the groin.

02:29.534 --> 02:31.199
We got to get
you reinstated, buddy.

02:31.200 --> 02:33.668
Without a license to kill,
you are a menace to society.

02:33.734 --> 02:34.966
Hey, listen, listen.

02:34.967 --> 02:36.033
I'm going to talk to Beckman.

02:36.034 --> 02:37.500
I'm going to tell her

02:37.501 --> 02:38.932
if she doesn't give you
your job back, I'm quitting.

02:38.933 --> 02:39.932
Don't be ridiculous.

02:39.933 --> 02:41.366
That's not ridiculous.

02:41.367 --> 02:43.199
I'm going to ask Sarah to
do the same thing, buddy.

02:43.200 --> 02:44.433
That is,
if she ever calls me back.

02:44.434 --> 02:45.733
You know she went
to DC with Shaw?

02:45.734 --> 02:47.400
Talk about a weekend
in Snoresville.

02:47.401 --> 02:49.334
Listen up, Chuck.
I disobeyed orders.

02:49.401 --> 02:51.634
I put my team
and my country in danger.

02:51.701 --> 02:53.199
This is my job now.

02:53.200 --> 02:55.100
I made my bunk,
and I'll lie in it.

02:55.134 --> 02:57.734
Unlike you, I know
when something's over.

02:57.800 --> 02:59.533
BIG MIKE
John Casey!

02:59.534 --> 03:02.234
My office! Now!

03:02.301 --> 03:04.567
Look, you were put in
an impossible position, okay?

03:04.634 --> 03:05.700
You had no choice.

03:05.701 --> 03:07.634
It's America, Chuck.

03:07.701 --> 03:09.366
Everyone has a choice.

03:09.367 --> 03:12.167
Casey!

03:12.234 --> 03:15.167
You have to choose, John.

03:15.234 --> 03:17.167
Do you see yourself
working here

03:17.234 --> 03:18.999
at the Buy More
for the long haul?

03:19.000 --> 03:22.167
Well... at the moment,
I don't have a better plan.

03:22.234 --> 03:24.401
Then you've got to stop
coming in so damn hot!

03:24.467 --> 03:25.866
Can't be laying hands on people.

03:25.867 --> 03:27.199
Not even Jeff
and Lester.

03:27.200 --> 03:28.400
He's not a man.

03:28.401 --> 03:29.832
He's an animal.
Like Jeff,

03:29.833 --> 03:31.166
but undulled by
drink or drug,

03:31.167 --> 03:32.433
and more dangerous
because of it!

03:32.434 --> 03:33.667
We demand justice!

03:33.668 --> 03:35.366
At least a humiliating
apology.

03:35.367 --> 03:36.366
Or we're gonna sue!

03:36.367 --> 03:37.366
Mmm!

03:37.367 --> 03:38.400
Who are we gonna sue again?

03:38.401 --> 03:39.600
Everybody! The store.

03:39.601 --> 03:41.066
Mr. John Q. Crazy.

03:41.067 --> 03:42.932
Possibly Chuck
and Morgan, too.

03:42.933 --> 03:45.501
You see, being the accused
in a number of civil and...

03:45.567 --> 03:49.200
criminal proceedings has left us
extremely litigious!

03:53.734 --> 03:55.033
Okay.

03:55.034 --> 03:56.733
No, no, no, good.

03:56.734 --> 03:58.734
Good! That's it!
You're hearing

03:58.800 --> 04:00.099
from my attorney!
Who, by the by,

04:00.100 --> 04:01.600
is my cousin!
Who, by the by,

04:01.601 --> 04:03.567
likes me very, very much!

04:10.768 --> 04:12.099
What?

04:12.100 --> 04:13.932
This is serious.

04:13.933 --> 04:15.867
Those boys aren't
fooling about this.

04:15.933 --> 04:18.067
Now... I like you,

04:18.134 --> 04:19.798
and I know you're
physically strong,

04:19.800 --> 04:21.632
but what I need
to know is

04:21.634 --> 04:23.567
are you mentally strong?

04:23.634 --> 04:25.933
Strong enough to bend
like the reed,

04:26.000 --> 04:28.933
and not snap like the Kit Kat?

04:29.000 --> 04:31.601
To be John Casey,
not John Crazy.

04:31.668 --> 04:33.266
Conking people;
walking around conking heads.

04:33.267 --> 04:35.668
You can't be conking heads
in the Buy More.

04:35.734 --> 04:36.932
It's the Buy More.

04:36.933 --> 04:38.833
Mm-hmm...

04:46.634 --> 04:48.033
Hey, Sarah.

04:48.034 --> 04:51.000
Hi.

04:51.067 --> 04:54.000
How was DC?

04:54.067 --> 04:56.034
I'm assuming you guys
had a lot of fun.

04:56.100 --> 04:58.567
Although I-I can't
really picture

04:58.634 --> 04:59.866
what Shaw does for fun.

04:59.867 --> 05:01.800
Uh, I'm sorry
I didn't call you back,

05:01.867 --> 05:03.199
but it was a work trip,

05:03.200 --> 05:05.200
and we were in a
lot of meetings.

05:06.501 --> 05:08.701
Talking about you,
actually.

05:08.768 --> 05:10.099
About your future.

05:10.100 --> 05:11.433
<i>My future? My future?!</i>

05:11.434 --> 05:12.667
No, no, no,
it's Casey's future

05:12.668 --> 05:14.133
that we need
to be concerned with, okay?

05:14.134 --> 05:15.700
We got to get him
reinstated. I know, Chuck.

05:15.701 --> 05:16.966
And I would like nothing more

05:16.967 --> 05:18.233
than to get him
reinstated, but...

05:18.234 --> 05:20.200
Casey's status is none
of your concern.

05:20.267 --> 05:22.200
There is business
to attend to, however,

05:22.267 --> 05:24.200
which very much
concerns you.

05:24.267 --> 05:27.200
You left your bag in the car on
the way back from the airport.

05:27.267 --> 05:28.366
Oh.

05:28.367 --> 05:29.533
So thoughtful.

05:29.534 --> 05:31.099
Good morning, team.

05:31.100 --> 05:33.234
Have you told him anything yet?

05:33.301 --> 05:34.966
Told me what?

05:34.967 --> 05:36.433
After much deliberation,

05:36.434 --> 05:38.199
it has been decided that
you are ready for a mission

05:38.200 --> 05:40.668
that will test everything
you have learned thus far.

05:40.734 --> 05:43.501
A final spy test, if you will.

05:43.567 --> 05:45.066
Oh.

05:45.067 --> 05:46.600
Test? Yeah. No problem.

05:46.601 --> 05:48.099
I'm a whiz with a
number two pencil.

05:48.100 --> 05:49.300
Scantron.

05:49.301 --> 05:50.932
Chuck, if you fail to
complete the mission,

05:50.933 --> 05:52.199
which you'll undertake
by yourself,

05:52.200 --> 05:53.832
then you'll go back
to your old life.

05:53.833 --> 05:55.300
But if you succeed,

05:55.301 --> 05:56.566
you will be promoted.

05:56.567 --> 05:59.000
No more Buy More,
no more handlers.

05:59.067 --> 06:01.501
Just real missions
for a real spy.

06:01.567 --> 06:03.166
You will be based out of Rome.

06:03.167 --> 06:06.601
Your cover will be that of
a billionaire industrialist.

06:06.668 --> 06:08.568
Serious- seriously?

06:10.501 --> 06:12.199
<i>Molto bene!</i>

06:12.200 --> 06:13.500
I love it! This is fantastic.

06:13.501 --> 06:14.533
We're all going to have

06:14.534 --> 06:15.866
to brush up on
our Italiano.

06:15.867 --> 06:17.033
No, Chuck.
Do you know what I mean?

06:17.034 --> 06:18.333
Just you.

06:18.334 --> 06:20.701
Agents Walker and Shaw
will be based in DC

06:20.768 --> 06:24.501
and continue to head
counter-Ring operations there.

06:24.567 --> 06:26.933
DC?

06:27.000 --> 06:29.601
D... DC.

06:29.668 --> 06:31.800
Not... not Rome.

06:31.867 --> 06:33.800
You will get your mission
specifics tomorrow.

06:33.867 --> 06:36.267
Your spy test will start then.

06:36.334 --> 06:38.301
Good luck.

06:38.367 --> 06:39.733
You can do this, Chuck.

06:39.734 --> 06:41.634
You can pass this test.

06:41.634 --> 06:43.534
It's everything
you've been working toward.

06:46.367 --> 06:48.334
Me...

06:48.401 --> 06:50.334
A real spy.

06:50.401 --> 06:52.099
In Rome, no less.

06:52.100 --> 06:54.067
Congratulations, Chuck.

06:55.501 --> 06:56.966
It looks like you're
going to get everything

06:56.967 --> 06:58.867
that you always wanted.

07:02.305 --> 07:07.458
Transcrypt by www.addic7ed.com

07:47.934 --> 07:49.901
Morning, Chuck.

07:49.967 --> 07:50.966
Ga- what?

07:50.967 --> 07:52.167
Hah...

07:52.168 --> 07:53.432
Hi.

07:53.433 --> 07:55.299
How-how long have
you been here?

07:55.300 --> 07:57.234
Or are you really here?

07:57.300 --> 08:00.767
I... I could be asleep
right now.

08:00.834 --> 08:02.767
I very well could be asleep
right now.

08:02.834 --> 08:05.467
I have some of the
most vivid dreams

08:05.534 --> 08:07.467
sometimes...
Chuck, you're awake.

08:07.534 --> 08:09.399
Please sit down.
Your mission has started.

08:09.400 --> 08:11.400
This is how a real agent

08:11.467 --> 08:14.400
gets missions
in the field.

08:14.467 --> 08:16.400
What, you surprising
them in the kitchen?

08:16.467 --> 08:17.800
That must involve
a lot of travel.

08:17.801 --> 08:19.000
Focus, Chuck.
From here on in,

08:19.001 --> 08:20.666
my role is to observe
and report.

08:20.667 --> 08:22.567
More of like a proctor
than a partner.

08:26.801 --> 08:28.701
What's this thing?

08:31.534 --> 08:33.200
What-what are you doing?
What are you doing?

08:33.201 --> 08:34.966
Are you writing something?
Are you writing about me?

08:34.967 --> 08:36.000
Are you grading me?

08:36.001 --> 08:37.200
Uh, think of it more like,

08:37.201 --> 08:39.168
recording the experience
for history.

08:39.234 --> 08:40.399
Sure.

08:40.400 --> 08:42.467
Good morning, Chuck.

08:42.534 --> 08:44.534
Your mission centers
around this man,

08:44.600 --> 08:46.133
Anatoli Zevlovski.

08:46.134 --> 08:47.699
A Russian FSB agent.

08:47.700 --> 08:49.267
He's in Los Angeles to meet

08:49.268 --> 08:51.100
with a person
we believe works for us.

08:51.101 --> 08:52.733
Who-who "us," General?

08:52.734 --> 08:53.599
It's a recording, Chuck.

08:53.600 --> 08:54.833
What's that?

08:54.834 --> 08:56.033
A mole within the CIA,

08:56.034 --> 08:57.499
who has been
selling secrets to Anatoli,

08:57.500 --> 08:58.966
who then sells them to the Ring.

08:58.967 --> 09:01.333
This mole is responsible
for the deaths

09:01.400 --> 09:04.201
of hundreds of civilians
and nine of our agents.

09:04.268 --> 09:07.467
We have intel that Anatoli
is meeting with him, or her,

09:07.534 --> 09:09.867
at the Cobalt Hotel
and Spa tonight.

09:09.934 --> 09:13.234
Your mission is to ascertain
the identity of the mole.

09:13.300 --> 09:14.900
You will stakeout
the hotel's entrance

09:14.901 --> 09:17.600
and let Anatoli lead you
to the mole.

09:17.667 --> 09:19.066
Wait!
That's all I need to know?

09:19.067 --> 09:20.766
How can that be all
I need to know?

09:20.767 --> 09:22.033
Is there a rewind on this thing?

09:22.034 --> 09:23.934
What's the deal? Come on.

09:24.634 --> 09:25.866
Wow.

09:25.867 --> 09:27.200
That just really
self-destructed, did it not?

09:27.201 --> 09:28.366
That-that's like
in the movies.

09:28.367 --> 09:29.399
That's incredible.

09:29.400 --> 09:30.432
Well, I got it, anyway.

09:30.433 --> 09:32.367
Take out Anatoli
and find the mole.

09:32.433 --> 09:34.333
Done and done.

09:36.634 --> 09:38.100
Still with the writing.
What is this?

09:38.101 --> 09:39.666
Like-like the CIA's
permanent record?

09:39.667 --> 09:40.900
It's just like in junior high.

09:40.901 --> 09:42.299
Pretty much.

09:42.300 --> 09:44.234
Really?

09:44.300 --> 09:45.699
So... so you're saying

09:45.700 --> 09:47.566
that's got all the greatest hits
in it, huh?

09:47.567 --> 09:50.001
All the, uh,
daring escapes,

09:50.067 --> 09:53.300
and last-second bomb defusions,
and-and I would hope, uh,

09:53.367 --> 09:55.333
all of the world-class
stakeout mixes.

09:57.067 --> 09:58.299
Yeah.

09:58.300 --> 10:00.400
Everything is in here.

10:00.467 --> 10:02.433
We've definitely been
through a lot.

10:04.333 --> 10:05.800
I mean, not-not just us.

10:05.801 --> 10:07.533
Casey, as well.

10:07.534 --> 10:09.200
Yeah, Casey, as well.
That guy.

10:09.201 --> 10:11.134
Uh, hey, hey, um,

10:11.201 --> 10:12.699
speaking-speaking
of stakeouts...

10:12.700 --> 10:15.067
uh, you're going to be
at the stakeout tonight, right?

10:15.134 --> 10:16.233
Right.

10:16.234 --> 10:17.666
Shaw will quarterback
from the Castle.

10:17.667 --> 10:20.600
But, so, so, this is like, um,

10:20.667 --> 10:23.067
our last mission together.

10:23.134 --> 10:25.234
Seems like we should
do something special.

10:25.300 --> 10:27.901
Something special will be you
completing your mission

10:27.967 --> 10:29.466
and becoming a spy, Chuck.

10:29.467 --> 10:31.400
Of course, of course.

10:31.467 --> 10:33.967
I'm just saying...

10:34.034 --> 10:35.366
last mission.

10:35.367 --> 10:36.633
Kind of makes you think.

10:36.634 --> 10:38.600
Old times.

10:38.700 --> 10:40.366
Good times.

10:40.367 --> 10:42.834
Dangerous, but-but good.

10:42.901 --> 10:45.467
Yeah. It does.

10:45.534 --> 10:48.534
I'll see you tonight.

10:48.600 --> 10:50.500
See you tonight.

10:54.600 --> 10:56.567
Chin up, please.

10:58.333 --> 10:59.933
This is Clarence,
my tailor.

10:59.934 --> 11:01.100
Hi.

11:01.101 --> 11:02.566
What is this about?

11:02.567 --> 11:04.667
Well, this is about...
Mmm!

11:04.734 --> 11:06.566
You lookin' good, Mike!

11:06.567 --> 11:07.833
You losing weight?

11:07.834 --> 11:09.233
Thank you, Clarence.
I have.

11:09.234 --> 11:11.700
I ask again: Why am I here?

11:11.767 --> 11:14.001
You're here because I want
to help you try

11:14.067 --> 11:16.234
to smooth out some
of those jagged edges.

11:16.300 --> 11:18.167
With a little help
from Clarence here.

11:18.168 --> 11:19.866
Mm-hmm.

11:19.867 --> 11:21.633
Jagged's good. I like jagged.

11:21.634 --> 11:23.834
You also like to be an
employed person, too, don't you?

11:23.901 --> 11:25.867
Maybe one without a lawsuit
slapped on him.

11:25.934 --> 11:29.400
Now, I've talked
to Jeff and Lester,

11:29.467 --> 11:32.234
told them that I could
get you to change.

11:32.300 --> 11:35.168
And that change
starts right now.

11:35.234 --> 11:37.834
Get on the box.

11:37.901 --> 11:39.766
You don't seriously think
that new clothes

11:39.767 --> 11:42.934
are going to somehow
make me less me, do you?

11:43.001 --> 11:45.600
Look, what I do know is that
to get your head right,

11:45.667 --> 11:47.366
you got to get
your threads right.

11:47.367 --> 11:48.966
Now, get on the box

11:48.967 --> 11:50.867
and let Clarence
put some new feathers on you.

12:36.867 --> 12:38.801
Hey, Chuck.

12:38.867 --> 12:40.767
Everything looks good.
It doesn't seem

12:40.767 --> 12:42.332
like you've
missed a trick.

12:42.333 --> 12:44.268
Uh, yeah, thanks.

12:44.333 --> 12:46.268
There is one more thing, though.

12:54.834 --> 12:56.734
* Ta-da! *

12:57.300 --> 13:01.101
No one throws a stakeout
like Chuck Bartowski.

13:01.168 --> 13:03.767
You can put that
in my secret file.

13:03.834 --> 13:05.734
A little bubbly
for you.

13:07.201 --> 13:10.101
And a little bubbly...
for me.

13:10.168 --> 13:11.733
Uh, so tell me-

13:11.734 --> 13:13.667
do the words,
"sizzling shrimp" ring a bell?

13:13.734 --> 13:15.667
From our very
first stakeout.

13:15.734 --> 13:17.634
That's right.
How could I forget?

13:26.201 --> 13:29.734
* *

13:29.801 --> 13:31.934
Also from our first stakeout.

13:32.001 --> 13:33.901
And yet, timeless.

13:34.901 --> 13:36.599
You're going to miss me in DC.

13:36.600 --> 13:38.500
You know that, right?

13:39.600 --> 13:41.500
I know.

13:46.268 --> 13:48.168
So, um...

13:49.967 --> 13:53.168
So, you and Shaw,
you're going to be...

13:53.234 --> 13:55.033
living together?
Is that it?

13:55.034 --> 13:57.801
Like, are you, uh...
you guys real serious or what?

13:57.867 --> 14:00.333
Uh, I don't know.

14:00.400 --> 14:03.667
It's... it's different.

14:03.734 --> 14:05.499
Different how?

14:05.500 --> 14:07.534
Than with you.

14:08.734 --> 14:10.634
You know, I'm...
I'm, uh... I'm...

14:15.268 --> 14:16.267
It's Shaw.

14:16.268 --> 14:17.866
Hold on.

14:17.867 --> 14:19.432
Yeah. Hello.

14:19.433 --> 14:21.600
Is there a problem?
Uh, no, no, there's no...

14:21.667 --> 14:23.499
there's no problem here.
Why would there be a problem?

14:23.500 --> 14:24.666
Can I talk to you
after the mission?

14:24.667 --> 14:26.801
You should have
your earpiece in already.

14:26.867 --> 14:28.267
Is Sarah there?

14:28.268 --> 14:29.866
Yeah, Sarah's right here.
She just got here.

14:29.867 --> 14:31.767
What a coincidence.
Hey, Sarah. How are you?

14:31.834 --> 14:33.533
Thanks for the reminder
about the earpieces.

14:33.534 --> 14:35.434
Anatoli and the mole
could arrive any minute, Chuck.

14:35.500 --> 14:36.599
Stay on the ball.

14:36.600 --> 14:37.933
It's all you out there.

14:37.934 --> 14:40.333
Okay. Talk to you soon. Bye.

14:51.734 --> 14:54.834
What I... what I was going
to ask you, uh, a minute ago,

14:54.901 --> 14:58.268
or what I was about
to say, anyway...

14:58.333 --> 15:01.534
was that I've been, um...
I've been thinking

15:01.600 --> 15:03.767
about what it used
to be like between us.

15:03.834 --> 15:05.200
Before Prague.

15:05.201 --> 15:09.700
And, uh, thinking about
what life would be like for us

15:09.767 --> 15:12.901
if we'd made
different decisions back then.

15:14.967 --> 15:17.934
If I had made
a different decision back then.

15:21.667 --> 15:23.499
Look, I know we couldn't
be together before

15:23.500 --> 15:26.101
because I wasn't a real spy,
but if I pass this test,

15:26.168 --> 15:30.901
we wouldn't have to choose
between the job and us.

15:30.967 --> 15:33.600
If I pass this test,
we could be together.

15:34.700 --> 15:36.432
That is, of course,

15:36.433 --> 15:39.600
if you're willing
to give it another shot.

15:51.333 --> 15:53.100
Did you see him?
Did you flash?

15:53.101 --> 15:54.332
No, I... no, I didn't.

15:54.333 --> 15:55.666
Should I have?

15:55.667 --> 15:57.734
Anatoli's in the hotel.
He just swiped a credit card

15:57.801 --> 15:59.499
he uses at the spa.
How did you miss him?

15:59.500 --> 16:00.533
I don't know.
I- I just did.

16:00.534 --> 16:02.133
I'm going after him.

16:02.134 --> 16:04.134
What?
Sarah, give him the glasses.

16:04.201 --> 16:05.966
Wait. Here.

16:05.967 --> 16:07.332
Put these on.
They'll record everything

16:07.333 --> 16:08.633
and relay it
back to Castle.

16:08.634 --> 16:10.634
Okay. Sarah, get back to Castle.

16:10.700 --> 16:11.833
You're on your own, Chuck.

16:11.834 --> 16:13.366
Now, get in there
before the mission

16:13.367 --> 16:15.267
and your spy career are over.

16:16.268 --> 16:18.168
This isn't over.

16:39.034 --> 16:40.934
Sir!

16:41.501 --> 16:42.699
Can I help you?

16:42.700 --> 16:44.601
Do you have an appointment
for a treatment?

16:44.668 --> 16:46.568
Uh, no, no, not an
appointment per se.

16:46.601 --> 16:48.634
I, uh, made plans with
a friend of mine-

16:48.700 --> 16:50.266
a Russian fellow-
to meet here.

16:50.267 --> 16:52.066
We really enjoy
spa-ing...

16:52.067 --> 16:54.234
together, so...

16:54.301 --> 16:56.501
Yes, I.. I think he
and his party just checked in.

16:56.568 --> 16:58.534
The day use fee is $100,

16:58.601 --> 16:59.732
not including
treatments.

16:59.733 --> 17:01.633
$100.

17:01.800 --> 17:03.934
Let me just...

17:04.000 --> 17:05.633
I can expense this, right?

17:05.634 --> 17:08.201
Pay it, Chuck.
Right.

17:08.267 --> 17:11.733
Just gonna break out
the old plastic.

17:11.800 --> 17:13.700
Good.

17:19.568 --> 17:22.367
I just checked the men's
locker room; nobody's here.

17:22.434 --> 17:24.334
Check the steam room.

17:24.800 --> 17:26.465
What? Uh, uh, excuse me.

17:26.467 --> 17:28.032
Inside the steam room?

17:28.034 --> 17:30.067
Is that really hygienic?

17:30.134 --> 17:32.034
You can tell me
when you come out.

17:47.167 --> 17:50.100
Wow, it's really steamy in here.

17:50.167 --> 17:52.601
Just sit tight. Steam will
clear up in a minute or so.

17:58.334 --> 17:59.533
What the hell happened
back there?

17:59.534 --> 18:00.600
It wasn't his fault.

18:00.601 --> 18:01.732
You've been in the field.

18:01.733 --> 18:03.633
Operations don't
always go as planned.

18:06.767 --> 18:08.967
Oh, wow. Hi there.

18:09.034 --> 18:10.832
Looks like I'm not
alone after all.

18:10.833 --> 18:11.866
No, just...

18:11.867 --> 18:14.467
three other
people in here...

18:14.534 --> 18:16.467
with me.

18:16.534 --> 18:17.533
How fun.

18:17.534 --> 18:18.966
It's just Anatoli
and his muscle.

18:18.967 --> 18:21.267
He must not have
made contact yet with the mole.

18:21.334 --> 18:23.234
Stay with him.

18:24.833 --> 18:26.600
Mr. Drago?

18:26.601 --> 18:28.466
Mr. Ivan Drago?
Yes.

18:28.467 --> 18:30.367
Ivan Drago. Seriously?

18:34.800 --> 18:36.366
He's paranoid.

18:36.367 --> 18:37.633
Believes we're
being followed.

18:37.634 --> 18:39.066
Wants to meet upstairs
in the room.

18:39.067 --> 18:40.967
Let's go.

18:50.900 --> 18:52.967
Hey. Why so quick

18:53.034 --> 18:54.934
<i>to pick up trash on banya floor?</i>

19:00.634 --> 19:02.534
Chuck, get out of there.

19:02.568 --> 19:04.468
Just doing my part.
Keeping it green.

19:25.800 --> 19:28.234
Chuck, you have to get
to the mole before he leaves.

19:28.301 --> 19:29.766
Get moving!

19:29.767 --> 19:31.767
Lockers
to your left, sir.

19:31.833 --> 19:33.733
Yeah.

19:56.467 --> 19:58.401
Anatoli's on the seventh floor.

19:58.467 --> 19:59.466
He's here meeting the mole.

19:59.467 --> 20:00.832
Nice work, Chuck.
Your priority

20:00.833 --> 20:02.934
is I.D.'ing the mole,
but do not blow your cover.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.133
He can't know
we're onto him.

20:04.134 --> 20:06.267
Got it.

20:14.568 --> 20:16.468
Ah! Good shower time.

20:16.501 --> 20:18.233
Oh, I think I got my
watch a little wet,

20:18.234 --> 20:20.134
so I'm just going to dry it off
on the balcony.

20:20.134 --> 20:23.100
Sorry, I forgot to put
the "privacy please" sign up.

20:31.900 --> 20:33.800
Come on, Chuck. You can do this.

20:44.867 --> 20:47.201
This would have been easier
in underpants.

20:47.267 --> 20:48.866
Well done.

20:48.867 --> 20:50.934
You are about to become
an even richer man.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.501
We should begin
the process of retrieval.

20:53.568 --> 20:55.601
Change of plans, Anatoli.

20:59.700 --> 21:01.934
I'm dealing directly
with the Ring now.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.900
Your services
are no longer needed.

21:15.234 --> 21:16.667
Oh, God... Oh, my God...

21:16.668 --> 21:18.366
The mole just killed Anatoli.

21:18.367 --> 21:19.567
Forget Anatoli.
The mole is leaving.

21:19.568 --> 21:21.468
You gotta get a look
at his face.

21:49.067 --> 21:51.100
We've got it, Chuck.

21:51.167 --> 21:53.601
Congratulations.

21:58.700 --> 22:00.700
I am a spy.

22:22.200 --> 22:24.167
Looking good, John.

22:24.234 --> 22:25.667
Feeling pretty good.

22:25.668 --> 22:27.433
Yeah, that Clarence
can work wonders.

22:27.434 --> 22:28.932
We here for a light lunch?

22:28.933 --> 22:30.266
Yes and no.

22:30.267 --> 22:32.501
I got Jeff and Lester
to agree to a deal.

22:34.234 --> 22:37.200
If you could sit down
with them and apologize,

22:37.267 --> 22:39.701
if you can show them that "John
Crazy" has been put on ice,

22:39.768 --> 22:41.400
they'll drop this
lawsuit thing.

22:41.401 --> 22:42.700
So the question is:

22:42.701 --> 22:45.900
you look cool;
can you be cool?

22:53.668 --> 22:55.900
Lester, Jeff...

22:55.967 --> 22:58.234
I would like to apologize...

22:59.867 --> 23:01.833
...for roughing you guys up
earlier; it's just, I...

23:01.900 --> 23:03.266
I'm sorry, Jonathan,

23:03.267 --> 23:05.167
but sweet, sweet,
sweet Lisa here

23:05.601 --> 23:07.266
would like
some payment

23:07.267 --> 23:08.799
for these
sandwiches.

23:08.800 --> 23:10.867
But I didn't order 'em. No.

23:10.933 --> 23:13.067
I did.

23:17.833 --> 23:20.867
Oh, my God,
is that tuna and pepperoni?

23:20.933 --> 23:22.133
Yes, it is.

23:22.134 --> 23:23.133
The tuna-roni.

23:23.134 --> 23:24.166
You see,

23:24.167 --> 23:25.333
Johnny Boy,

23:25.334 --> 23:26.999
I need to know
that you understand

23:27.000 --> 23:28.333
that apologies

23:28.334 --> 23:29.899
are about more
than just words.

23:29.900 --> 23:34.067
Often, they're about money,
and in this case, yours.

23:34.134 --> 23:36.900
Mm-hmm.

23:41.434 --> 23:42.999
Keep the change, sister.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.366
Lester, you're pushing it.

23:44.367 --> 23:46.434
The man apologized.
Now let it go.

23:46.534 --> 23:48.333
What assurances
do Jeffrey and I have

23:48.334 --> 23:50.434
that such civilized behavior
is gonna continue

23:50.501 --> 23:51.932
when we and this

23:51.933 --> 23:54.000
monster are
alone together?

23:55.467 --> 23:56.667
Oh, God.

23:56.668 --> 23:57.832
It was good.

23:57.833 --> 23:59.768
Yummy.

23:59.833 --> 24:02.534
Lester, I promise I won't
bang you guys around anymore.

24:02.601 --> 24:04.501
Okay, Lester-
so everything's cool.

24:04.501 --> 24:06.567
No more lawsuit.

24:06.634 --> 24:07.633
Yeah, we're cool.

24:07.634 --> 24:08.899
If...

24:08.900 --> 24:10.300
we seal
our newfound understanding

24:10.301 --> 24:12.166
in that time-tested way-

24:12.167 --> 24:14.534
by breaking
freshly-baked bread together.

24:14.601 --> 24:16.366
Right? I think that's...

24:16.367 --> 24:18.267
Jefferson?

24:19.000 --> 24:21.467
Mind you,
there's literally no way

24:21.534 --> 24:23.900
of knowing where this guy's
mouth has been before this.

24:23.967 --> 24:25.867
Fire hydrants, diseased animals,

24:25.900 --> 24:27.800
puppets.

24:31.401 --> 24:33.634
Very civilized.

24:33.701 --> 24:35.300
Oh, no.

24:35.301 --> 24:37.201
Oh, John.

24:44.933 --> 24:46.266
Hey, there, colleague.

24:46.267 --> 24:48.167
Peer.

24:48.933 --> 24:50.099
Uh, hey, so tell me.

24:50.100 --> 24:51.266
When should I expect

24:51.267 --> 24:53.401
to receive my international
spy union card, hmm?

24:53.467 --> 24:55.367
You did a great job
last night, Chuck.

24:55.434 --> 24:56.667
Congratulations.

24:56.668 --> 24:58.466
Thank you.
I appreciate that.

24:58.467 --> 25:01.200
Uh, so, tell me-
uh, and this is just, you know,

25:01.267 --> 25:02.533
between the two of us,

25:02.534 --> 25:04.467
just for the sake
of conversation, but, uh-

25:04.534 --> 25:06.033
as far as these tests go,

25:06.034 --> 25:08.534
do other people usually do
as well as I did?

25:08.601 --> 25:10.400
Or did I do, like,
historically well?

25:10.401 --> 25:12.301
Uh, listen, Chuck,

25:12.334 --> 25:15.134
I was hoping that you would
be free for dinner tonight.

25:15.200 --> 25:17.100
Yeah?

25:17.100 --> 25:19.000
Yeah, uh, yeah, of course.

25:19.034 --> 25:22.367
In fact, I was actually going
to ask you if-if you were free.

25:22.434 --> 25:24.233
So, how about

25:24.234 --> 25:25.500
Traxx?

25:25.501 --> 25:27.333
It's a restaurant
down at Union Station.

25:27.334 --> 25:30.067
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, that sounds great.

25:30.134 --> 25:33.933
Nothing whets the whistle like
the sound of a nice long horn.

25:35.933 --> 25:37.466
Forget it.
I'm-I'm very excited.

25:37.467 --> 25:39.099
Well, don't be too excited.

25:39.100 --> 25:40.400
Let me finish.

25:40.401 --> 25:43.634
By "excited," I-I mean,
uh, cold as ice,

25:43.701 --> 25:46.900
because, you know,
now I am a real spy.

25:54.534 --> 25:56.501
<i>You made me proud.</i>

25:56.567 --> 25:58.400
<i>Oh, I got to say,
you were right.</i>

25:58.401 --> 26:00.933
Feels good not to be
so wound up all the time.

26:01.000 --> 26:02.166
What'd I tell you?

26:02.167 --> 26:04.067
Subway can soothe the
tummy and the soul.

26:04.100 --> 26:06.867
Oh, did somebody say something
about soothed tummies and souls?

26:06.933 --> 26:08.900
I did, and I'm
happy to say

26:08.967 --> 26:11.668
we've got ourself
a changed man, Chuck.

26:14.367 --> 26:17.301
<i>Well, uh, I guess
that makes two changed men.</i>

26:17.367 --> 26:19.267
What? You?
Yeah.

26:20.734 --> 26:23.467
Buddy, I-I just passed my first
solo spy test last night.

26:23.534 --> 26:25.199
This is it.
I'm going to the show.

26:25.200 --> 26:26.667
I- I really wanted
to tell you beforehand.

26:26.668 --> 26:27.932
I'm sorry that I didn't.

26:27.933 --> 26:29.400
But you know, top secret.
You understand?

26:29.401 --> 26:31.900
You took your test last
night, and you passed?

26:31.967 --> 26:34.167
Oh, yeah...
with flying colors, man.

26:34.234 --> 26:35.932
And I think we both know

26:35.933 --> 26:37.967
that I have you
to thank for that,

26:38.034 --> 26:40.933
so I-I... wanted to give you
a little something.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.134
Yeah.

26:43.200 --> 26:46.734
I don't think they're gonna
miss it down in Castle, do you?

26:47.800 --> 26:49.700
What?

26:50.267 --> 26:52.301
You know that giving away
a government-issued firearm

26:52.367 --> 26:55.000
is a felony, don't you?

26:55.067 --> 26:57.434
But it was a thoughtful felony.

26:57.501 --> 26:59.534
Honestly, everything
is coming up roses right now.

26:59.601 --> 27:01.266
I mean, I passed my test.

27:01.267 --> 27:04.334
Uh, you are joining the world of
human beings, so proud of you.

27:04.401 --> 27:05.400
Kudos for that.

27:05.401 --> 27:06.500
And Sarah

27:06.501 --> 27:08.133
has invited me
to dinner tonight.

27:08.134 --> 27:09.566
Alone.

27:09.567 --> 27:11.601
At Union Station, so...

27:11.668 --> 27:14.933
Really? You sure
you've completed your test?

27:15.000 --> 27:16.933
Yeah. Yeah, like I said,
I passed.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.832
Celebration time now.

27:18.833 --> 27:21.034
Hmm. Okay.

27:21.100 --> 27:22.667
You just be careful out there.

27:22.668 --> 27:24.233
Ready for anything.

27:24.234 --> 27:26.634
Yeah. A good spy
always is, right?

27:30.668 --> 27:33.067
You told him
to meet you tonight?

27:33.134 --> 27:34.500
I did.

27:34.501 --> 27:35.932
So, what's the rest
of his mission?

27:35.933 --> 27:37.300
With Anatoli dead,

27:37.301 --> 27:39.967
there's only one piece left
to be cleaned up: Perry.

27:40.034 --> 27:42.668
We've arranged for him
to meet Chuck at the restaurant.

27:42.734 --> 27:45.267
And Chuck has
to bring him in?

27:45.334 --> 27:46.533
No.

27:46.534 --> 27:48.166
Chuck has to kill him.

27:48.167 --> 27:50.301
What?

27:50.367 --> 27:52.267
Chuck has to kill him?

27:52.267 --> 27:54.099
You're giving him
his Red Test tonight?

27:54.100 --> 27:55.932
That's right.

27:55.933 --> 27:57.366
Why didn't you tell me?

27:57.367 --> 27:59.534
Because you would've said
you couldn't be a part of it.

27:59.601 --> 28:01.534
I can't.

28:01.601 --> 28:04.167
I can't be a part of it,
and I won't.

28:05.267 --> 28:06.866
You have to meet him.

28:06.867 --> 28:08.900
I can't make him
do something like that.

28:08.967 --> 28:11.000
I'm not even sure
that I want him

28:11.067 --> 28:12.967
to be able
to do something like that.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.334
I'm sorry, Sarah, but
this isn't about what you want.

28:15.401 --> 28:16.633
It's about Chuck,

28:16.634 --> 28:18.233
and our finding out
what he's capable of.

28:18.234 --> 28:20.167
Perry is a seasoned agent,

28:20.234 --> 28:22.401
and he is gonna do anything
to save himself.

28:22.467 --> 28:24.634
And if Chuck freezes, then...

28:24.701 --> 28:27.100
then... we could lose him.

28:27.167 --> 28:28.566
And that's why you'll be there.

28:28.567 --> 28:29.967
If you give him the order,

28:29.968 --> 28:31.868
if you tell him to kill perry,
he'll do it.

29:05.000 --> 29:06.900
Hi.

29:08.601 --> 29:10.601
Wow.

29:10.668 --> 29:12.333
You look great.

29:12.334 --> 29:13.567
Better than great.

29:13.568 --> 29:15.233
Thank you.

29:15.234 --> 29:16.766
You look great, too.

29:16.767 --> 29:18.066
Thank you very much.

29:18.067 --> 29:19.967
Feel pretty good.

29:21.668 --> 29:23.900
Right off the bat, I-I
just... I want to apologize.

29:23.967 --> 29:25.366
I want to say I'm sorry

29:25.367 --> 29:27.601
if I came across a little
too strong last night.

29:27.668 --> 29:29.833
It's just that, with the way
things seemed to be progressing

29:29.900 --> 29:32.634
between you and Shaw, I wanted
to tell you how I felt, and I...

29:32.733 --> 29:34.200
Chuck...

29:34.201 --> 29:36.167
I'm doing it again, aren't I?
I'm coming across...

29:36.234 --> 29:37.600
I'm-I'm... I'm coming
across too strong.

29:37.601 --> 29:38.766
I'm sorry about that.

29:38.767 --> 29:40.934
Appetizer? Uh...

29:41.000 --> 29:42.166
Let's have an appetizer.

29:42.167 --> 29:43.333
No! What am I thinking?

29:43.334 --> 29:44.966
I got to thank you.
Thank you.

29:44.967 --> 29:46.600
I wouldn't even be here right
now if it wasn't for you.

29:46.601 --> 29:47.766
Please don't say that.

29:47.767 --> 29:49.466
But it's true.

29:49.467 --> 29:52.267
Chuck, you're going to want
to stay calm right now, okay?

29:52.334 --> 29:54.634
I need you to trust me.

29:56.301 --> 29:58.601
Why? Are you planning on
surprising me with something?

29:58.668 --> 29:59.999
Is that what this is?

30:00.000 --> 30:01.967
Uh, something like that, yeah.

30:05.034 --> 30:07.867
Your mission
isn't over, Chuck.

30:14.167 --> 30:17.800
The man in the photo is the man
that you I.D.'d last night.

30:17.867 --> 30:20.301
He's a traitor who continues
to put civilians

30:20.367 --> 30:22.267
and agents
and the nation at risk.

30:22.334 --> 30:24.634
We have arranged
for you to meet him here

30:24.700 --> 30:26.533
at the restaurant
in five minutes time.

30:26.534 --> 30:28.200
He knows you are CIA.

30:28.201 --> 30:29.832
And he will remain cautious,

30:29.833 --> 30:32.034
and probably try
to maintain his cover.

30:51.000 --> 30:54.201
The final part
of your mission is to kill him.

30:56.467 --> 30:59.034
Are you being serious right now?
Are you kidding me?

30:59.100 --> 31:01.634
Kill him here, now?
I can't do that.

31:01.700 --> 31:03.600
Then you won't become a spy.

31:04.501 --> 31:06.501
But then...

31:08.501 --> 31:10.934
...we couldn't...

31:11.000 --> 31:13.367
No. Probably not.

31:14.467 --> 31:16.967
Sarah, when all this started,

31:17.034 --> 31:20.401
I didn't think I had a chance
at ever becoming a real spy.

31:22.467 --> 31:24.534
But if I...
if I can't do this,

31:24.601 --> 31:26.200
then-then... then what'll I be?

31:26.201 --> 31:27.600
Then you'll be Chuck,

31:27.601 --> 31:29.501
and there is nothing wrong
with that.

31:31.467 --> 31:33.401
That's all I can say.

31:33.467 --> 31:35.367
I'm sorry.
The rest is your decision.

31:38.467 --> 31:40.501
Sarah, wait.

31:40.568 --> 31:42.800
Are-Are we absolutely sure
about this guy?

31:42.867 --> 31:44.800
Yes. Your target is Perry.

31:44.867 --> 31:47.201
Your orders are clear.

31:49.234 --> 31:51.501
I don't know if I can do this.

31:51.568 --> 31:53.300
The decision is yours, Chuck,

31:53.301 --> 31:55.934
but please know
that there is no turning back.

32:00.067 --> 32:02.067
* *

32:25.167 --> 32:27.067
Has Carmichael checked in?

32:36.534 --> 32:38.033
Carmichael?

32:38.034 --> 32:40.467
Uh, uh, yeah.

32:40.534 --> 32:42.668
Yeah, that's me.

32:44.334 --> 32:46.800
Hope this doesn't take
too long.

32:46.867 --> 32:48.366
Got a date later.

32:48.367 --> 32:50.334
Yeah, yeah, it shouldn't-
that shouldn't be a problem.

32:50.401 --> 32:53.301
This should be... fast.

32:55.034 --> 32:58.401
These are, uh, some photos of
some folks that I work with.

32:58.467 --> 33:03.100
Just wanted to see if maybe
you recognize any of them.

33:03.167 --> 33:04.899
Uh, yeah, maybe I will.

33:04.900 --> 33:07.301
Sort of pride myself
on never forgetting faces.

33:07.367 --> 33:09.700
I should hit the restroom
first, though.

33:09.767 --> 33:10.832
Is that okay?

33:10.833 --> 33:13.000
Yeah, yeah, sure, not a problem.

33:42.833 --> 33:45.167
* *

34:39.699 --> 34:41.833
Get up.

34:41.900 --> 34:43.033
Get up!
Relax, relax!

34:43.034 --> 34:44.266
Relax, relax.

34:44.266 --> 34:46.601
Look, I had no choice;
I had no choice.

34:46.668 --> 34:48.366
These people- the Ring-
you have no idea.

34:48.367 --> 34:50.132
Oh, I have an idea. Then
you know these people

34:50.134 --> 34:51.966
weren't going
to put me in jail.

34:51.967 --> 34:53.867
They were going to kill me.

34:55.634 --> 34:58.401
You're not here
to arrest me either.

35:00.201 --> 35:02.201
I should have known.

35:02.267 --> 35:04.167
You might as well be
one of them.

35:07.034 --> 35:11.100
I am not one of them; I will
never be one of them;

35:11.167 --> 35:14.301
<i>and for that very reason,
I am going to arrest you.</i>

35:14.367 --> 35:15.899
In fact, at
this very moment,

35:15.900 --> 35:18.934
consider yourself
officially arrested, okay?

35:19.000 --> 35:20.667
Okay? Now, you and I,

35:20.668 --> 35:24.034
you and I- we're going to take
a nice, friendly, calm,

35:24.100 --> 35:26.700
leisurely walk out
of this men's room.

35:26.767 --> 35:27.933
Turn around.

35:27.934 --> 35:30.568
Turn around!
Turn around!

35:44.401 --> 35:46.334
Sarah, what's happening?

35:46.401 --> 35:47.667
Mind easing up
on that piece?

35:47.668 --> 35:50.100
My back's all screwed up.

35:50.167 --> 35:52.568
Thanks, buddy.

35:52.634 --> 35:54.166
Slow it down, okay?

35:54.167 --> 35:55.300
Hey, slow down.

35:55.301 --> 35:57.201
Whoa.
Whoa, I'm sor...

36:26.201 --> 36:29.534
* *

36:59.067 --> 37:01.334
Wait, don't do it,
don't do it, don't do it.

37:01.401 --> 37:03.066
Don't you see? This is
exactly what they want.

37:03.067 --> 37:04.567
I gave you a chance.

37:04.568 --> 37:06.867
Please... I had no choice.

37:42.167 --> 37:44.067
Well?

37:54.634 --> 37:56.568
What does
all this mean, Casey?

37:56.634 --> 37:58.934
I mean, technically,
I failed my test.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.634
You need to understand that
to Walker, Shaw, and Beckman,

38:01.700 --> 38:03.533
you passed the test.

38:03.534 --> 38:05.434
To them, you
killed Perry,

38:05.467 --> 38:06.766
doing exactly what you
were trained to do.

38:06.767 --> 38:08.200
Yeah, except that I didn't
do it, you did.

38:08.201 --> 38:10.134
Chuck, I'm a civilian,

38:10.201 --> 38:12.568
which means technically,
under the law,

38:12.634 --> 38:13.899
what happened
tonight was murder.

38:13.900 --> 38:16.234
No one can know the
truth about that

38:16.301 --> 38:19.134
ever...
not even Sarah.

38:19.201 --> 38:20.433
She'd be
implicated, too.

38:20.434 --> 38:22.634
But all that means
that I'm still not a real spy.

38:22.700 --> 38:24.900
I don't know who I am;
I don't know what I am.

38:24.967 --> 38:26.867
Can't answer that
one for you, Chuck.

38:29.800 --> 38:31.767
Hey...

38:33.067 --> 38:35.034
Why did you do it?

38:35.100 --> 38:37.900
Because you weren't going to.

38:37.967 --> 38:39.867
You're not a killer, Chuck.

38:40.301 --> 38:42.501
Thanks.

38:45.067 --> 38:48.234
Come on, Sarah.

38:48.301 --> 38:50.334
Where are you?

38:56.833 --> 38:59.167
Sarah?

39:17.668 --> 39:19.033
Good evening, Chuck.

39:19.034 --> 39:22.301
Congratulations.
You are now officially an agent.

39:22.367 --> 39:25.534
Included is a plane ticket
to Washington for your immediate

39:25.601 --> 39:27.733
final induction and processing.

39:27.800 --> 39:31.501
Sarah and Shaw will stay behind
to wrap out Burbank operations.

39:46.501 --> 39:48.401
Come on, Sarah.

39:53.067 --> 39:54.600
Sarah, hey, uh...

39:54.601 --> 39:56.501
it's, it's me.

39:58.100 --> 40:00.668
<i>I- I need to talk to you.</i>

40:01.700 --> 40:03.333
About everything.

40:03.334 --> 40:06.967
Are you okay?

40:07.034 --> 40:09.733
I... I just didn't think
that he would do it.

40:09.800 --> 40:12.733
They want me to fly
to DC tonight.

40:14.201 --> 40:17.100
And now I realize that
it's my fault that he did.

40:17.167 --> 40:19.467
Please just call me back
as soon as you get this message.

40:19.534 --> 40:21.467
Chuck made his
own choice,

40:21.534 --> 40:23.400
and, like the rest
of us, he did it

40:23.401 --> 40:25.401
to serve his country.

40:26.700 --> 40:28.500
At dinner, he said
he wouldn't even be here

40:28.501 --> 40:30.634
if it wasn't for me,
and he was right.

40:30.700 --> 40:32.567
Are you still in love with him?

40:32.568 --> 40:35.334
No.

40:35.401 --> 40:37.401
Not anymore.

40:40.668 --> 40:44.201
It's just, he's not going
to be the same person again.

40:44.267 --> 40:45.400
I know I wasn't.

40:45.401 --> 40:47.767
I remember everything
about my Red Test.

40:49.833 --> 40:52.334
<i>A street name
and a time to be there.</i>

40:55.067 --> 40:56.967
<i>No name, just a photo.</i>

41:00.401 --> 41:03.000
<i>And it was all happening
the way it was supposed to.</i>

41:05.434 --> 41:07.733
<i>And then she dropped something,
like a piece of jewelry, and...</i>

41:10.700 --> 41:11.966
<i>...and I just couldn't do it,</i>

41:11.967 --> 41:13.600
not with her
on the ground like that,

41:13.601 --> 41:16.401
so I just
kept walking.

41:17.767 --> 41:19.333
<i>And then, in a reflection,</i>

41:19.334 --> 41:21.501
<i>I saw her reaching
for a weapon.</i>

41:21.568 --> 41:26.201
<i>Well, at least I thought
I saw her reaching.</i>

41:29.634 --> 41:32.733
<i>And I wanted to go back
and check to make sure,</i>

41:32.800 --> 41:36.067
<i>but it was, uh,
there was no time.</i>

41:36.134 --> 41:39.067
It's never easy.

41:39.134 --> 41:41.534
But, in the end,
it helps to save lives.

41:41.601 --> 41:43.833
Never forget that.

41:46.134 --> 41:48.700
It was the worst day of my life.

41:54.767 --> 41:56.733
Oh, thank God- Sarah.

42:01.900 --> 42:03.066
Hey.

42:03.067 --> 42:04.799
Good evening, Agent Bartowski.

42:04.800 --> 42:06.200
Your flight to Washington
leaves in an hour.

42:06.201 --> 42:08.066
I'm here to take you to
the airport.

42:08.067 --> 42:09.967
Are you ready?
