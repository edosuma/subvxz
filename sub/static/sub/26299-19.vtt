WEBVTT

00:05.406 --> 00:06.859
Shh!
You'll wake Lily.

00:06.907 --> 00:08.852
How drunk are you?
I told you three times

00:08.940 --> 00:10.967
- she's onthat school trip.
- I'd feel more confident

00:11.055 --> 00:12.710
- if you weren't also whispering.
- Fair point.

00:12.797 --> 00:14.163
Are...
Are you wearing lipstick?

00:14.251 --> 00:16.131
- Hm?
- Am I wearing nail polish?

00:17.245 --> 00:19.078
So, we kind of had
a crazy night out.

00:19.166 --> 00:20.553
It started off
at this little

00:20.641 --> 00:22.991
under-the-radar speakeasy
I heard about.

00:23.108 --> 00:25.335
Uh, he Googled
"cool bars near me."

00:25.423 --> 00:26.914
Anyway, we met a group
of 20-somethings

00:27.001 --> 00:28.536
that... took a shine to us.

00:28.624 --> 00:31.426
They introduced us to the world
of underground parties

00:31.514 --> 00:32.582
and $18 cocktails.

00:32.670 --> 00:33.835
- It was so burnt.
- Lit.

00:33.923 --> 00:34.957
Lit.
Lit.

00:35.045 --> 00:37.514
I don't even remember
half these bars.

00:37.602 --> 00:39.075
Did we go to
a hospital last night?

00:39.163 --> 00:41.076
Okay, Grandma Tucker's
hangover remedy...

00:41.178 --> 00:43.881
Put a pat of butter underneathyour
tongue, tip your head back,

00:43.969 --> 00:45.483
and I'll pour the hot sauce
up your nose.

00:45.570 --> 00:46.747
Wait, wait,
wait, wait.

00:46.835 --> 00:48.700
- That's a group text from Binker.
- What?

00:48.788 --> 00:50.441
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, my gosh.

00:50.569 --> 00:52.578
The gang wants to get back
together and party tonight.

00:52.665 --> 00:54.248
And you said
we'd never hear from them

00:54.336 --> 00:56.543
after they saw us in that
horrible Denny's lighting.

00:56.631 --> 00:59.538
Okay, we have to play this
exactly right...

00:59.647 --> 01:01.108
We don't want
to come off too eager,

01:01.196 --> 01:03.702
but we also want to let
'em knowwe're down to mob.

01:03.878 --> 01:05.751
- Oh, my God.
- Cam, you knowour rule,

01:05.839 --> 01:07.241
we never go out
two nights in a row.

01:07.329 --> 01:09.443
- Yeah, I know, but this is...
- We're already pushing it

01:09.530 --> 01:10.941
by going to that
lecture series tonight.

01:11.028 --> 01:12.534
What lecture series?

01:12.622 --> 01:14.330
Alan Greenspan'stop aide.

01:14.418 --> 01:16.457
We bought the season passso
we'd get premium seating

01:16.544 --> 01:18.448
to "A Night of
Sarcasmwith Fran Lebowitz."

01:18.682 --> 01:20.846
Oh, everyone's in.

01:20.971 --> 01:24.401
- Look at all those thumbs of colors.
- They're so woke.

01:25.138 --> 01:26.752
"We're out.
Catch you next time"?

01:26.840 --> 01:27.885
Mitchell.

01:28.093 --> 01:29.260
How could you?

01:29.348 --> 01:31.138
Storm out softly.
You'll wake Lily.

01:46.890 --> 01:49.511
Morning, honey.
Don't mind all the Caltech gear.

01:49.599 --> 01:52.560
I figured I'd surprise Alexat
school and take her to lunch.

01:52.699 --> 01:53.831
Surprise her?

01:53.919 --> 01:55.747
At the end of the semester?

01:55.849 --> 01:57.569
Honey, she's probablyin
the middle of exams.

01:57.669 --> 01:59.122
She's gonna be...

01:59.567 --> 02:00.770
thrilled.

02:01.083 --> 02:02.581
Have you ever
seen a video of yourself

02:02.669 --> 02:04.847
wearing something you didn't
realize was unflattering?

02:04.935 --> 02:07.442
Well, that happened
to me recently, and...

02:07.688 --> 02:09.170
it was my personality.

02:09.402 --> 02:12.380
For centuries, man has longed
to rule the air

02:12.468 --> 02:14.138
like the majestic
squirrel.

02:14.395 --> 02:16.181
The wait ends
today.

02:16.268 --> 02:17.315
Nope.

02:17.403 --> 02:18.909
Uh, but
what if we...

02:18.997 --> 02:20.425
- Doesn't matter.
- Hey, Mom.

02:20.513 --> 02:21.751
I can pull this off,
right?

02:21.924 --> 02:23.552
Let me.
Oh.

02:25.968 --> 02:27.700
Ah, we're not home.

02:28.778 --> 02:30.739
I made a decision
to be less negative.

02:30.827 --> 02:34.028
It's the new me,
the girl who says "yes."

02:34.747 --> 02:36.241
Friend went to Mexico
for the weekend.

02:36.329 --> 02:37.769
I'm finding the level.

02:38.779 --> 02:41.042
Crockett and Tubbs,
you look snazzy.

02:41.130 --> 02:42.563
Thanks... I think.

02:42.651 --> 02:43.913
I'm trying
to step up my game.

02:44.001 --> 02:45.421
I started seeing
someone from work.

02:45.509 --> 02:47.483
Oh, honey.
I don't know

02:47.571 --> 02:49.211
if I think that's such
a good idea that...

02:50.992 --> 02:52.922
Never mind.
I approve.

02:54.477 --> 02:55.911
I doubt
my mom would approve

02:55.999 --> 02:57.529
if she knew
the whole story.

02:58.706 --> 02:59.830
Pool boy.

02:59.918 --> 03:01.327
I need more towels.

03:01.415 --> 03:03.065
Right away, ma'am.

03:11.888 --> 03:14.581
Done. I just approved
another design.

03:14.668 --> 03:17.022
The most luxurious
dog bed yet.

03:17.110 --> 03:18.013
I call it...

03:18.108 --> 03:19.313
The Top of the Bark.

03:19.407 --> 03:20.876
GAh, that's nice
that you can

03:20.964 --> 03:22.585
run your new company
at home

03:22.673 --> 03:25.079
in clothes that
you can only wear at home.

03:26.118 --> 03:28.291
When men get to a certain age,

03:28.378 --> 03:29.499
they stop trying.

03:29.587 --> 03:31.110
I've seen it before.

03:31.198 --> 03:33.311
First, it starts
with the clothes,

03:33.399 --> 03:35.585
then the body,
then the brain.

03:35.673 --> 03:37.428
But I can't say
anything to Jay,

03:37.516 --> 03:39.611
because when it comes
to his appearance,

03:39.821 --> 03:41.337
he's very sensitive.

03:42.149 --> 03:44.181
Mi amor, I'm back.

03:44.268 --> 03:45.415
Welcome home.

03:46.548 --> 03:47.621
You hate it, right?

03:47.708 --> 03:48.931
I'll shave it.
It's a joke.

03:49.019 --> 03:50.493
Stupid!

03:51.798 --> 03:53.191
Good dawning, all.

03:53.462 --> 03:54.618
What am I looking at?

03:54.706 --> 03:56.806
Is the vet worried
you're gonna bite yourself?

03:56.894 --> 03:58.501
It's a traditional
Tudor collar.

03:58.610 --> 04:00.538
I'm pledging my school's
Elizabethan Society,

04:00.626 --> 04:02.205
and I have to wear this
as a hazing ritual.

04:02.292 --> 04:03.391
I don't hate it.

04:03.479 --> 04:04.735
I think it makes your head

04:04.823 --> 04:07.108
look like one of
those fancy cookies.

04:07.196 --> 04:09.610
I also have to recite several
Shakespearean monologues

04:09.698 --> 04:12.087
and festoon our dining hall
with some bawdy bunting.

04:12.175 --> 04:13.532
What happened
to hazing?

04:13.620 --> 04:15.103
It used to bemacho stuff,
you know,

04:15.191 --> 04:18.038
like making a guy drink
a shotout of your belly button or

04:18.125 --> 04:19.430
passing
an orange around

04:19.548 --> 04:21.091
only using
your butt cheeks.

04:21.178 --> 04:23.563
Look. It's one of the most
selective groups on campus.

04:23.651 --> 04:25.118
I don't
want to jinx it,

04:25.206 --> 04:26.595
but a week from now,
I could be learning

04:26.682 --> 04:28.829
- the steps of the secret minuet.
- Ooh.

04:28.917 --> 04:31.813
This is what happens whenyou
eliminate campus bullying.

04:32.360 --> 04:34.116
Jay,
what do you think?

04:34.204 --> 04:36.507
We'll go out
for a nice lunch,

04:36.611 --> 04:38.304
dress up
a little bit.

04:38.392 --> 04:39.657
This feels like an attack.

04:39.790 --> 04:41.451
All right, that's as gentle
as I can go,

04:41.538 --> 04:43.282
I am Colombian,
not Canadian.

04:43.370 --> 04:44.671
I got an e-mail
from the club.

04:44.758 --> 04:46.759
The older players have
takenover the driving range

04:46.847 --> 04:48.868
for bocce
weekday mornings.

04:48.956 --> 04:51.120
So what?
You can play golf later.

04:51.208 --> 04:52.601
No, we got
a whole group...

04:52.688 --> 04:53.941
The Sunrise Swingers.

04:54.028 --> 04:55.901
We meet there at 6:00,
hit a bucket.

04:56.087 --> 04:57.774
One of the galsis making up
tank tops.

04:57.862 --> 05:00.610
Oh, yay.
More casual clothes.

05:00.698 --> 05:02.313
No, I'm going down there,
get the support

05:02.401 --> 05:03.481
of some of
the other golfers.

05:03.568 --> 05:05.439
- Maybe I can fight this thing.
- Okay, good idea,

05:05.526 --> 05:08.490
but don't forget that
there is a dress code at the club.

05:08.578 --> 05:10.231
They probably already
overturned it.

05:10.319 --> 05:11.971
Ah, the whole place
went to hell

05:12.059 --> 05:13.552
when they stopped
puttingice in the urinals.

05:13.639 --> 05:15.518
There's just something
about destroying a thing

05:15.606 --> 05:16.689
while you're
taking a pee

05:16.777 --> 05:18.791
that makes a man
feel like a man.

05:21.619 --> 05:23.565
Oh, well,
hello there.

05:23.675 --> 05:25.393
Uh, Dad.
What are you doing here?

05:25.480 --> 05:26.422
Hi.

05:26.510 --> 05:28.151
I thought
I'd take you to lunch.

05:28.400 --> 05:30.190
It wasn't just about lunch.

05:30.366 --> 05:33.158
Of my three kids, I've always
felt least connected with Alex.

05:33.246 --> 05:35.158
And I'm afraid that
the distance between us

05:35.248 --> 05:37.002
might grow
after she graduates.

05:37.090 --> 05:39.604
Wow. Graduates?

05:40.186 --> 05:42.119
It was just, like, 10 years ago

05:42.207 --> 05:44.338
when she took
her first college course.

05:44.920 --> 05:46.184
I really wish
you would've called.

05:46.271 --> 05:48.444
I can't go to lunch today.
I'm late for...

05:48.532 --> 05:50.846
- an event.
- Is that why you're all dressed up?

05:50.934 --> 05:52.393
Yeah.
But it's no big deal.

05:52.481 --> 05:54.779
B-T-dubs, have you seen
your school paper?

05:54.867 --> 05:56.932
Apparently, your valedictorian
is a chimp.

05:57.020 --> 05:58.790
How is that
not bigger news?

05:58.878 --> 06:00.661
It's a fake paper, Dad.

06:00.809 --> 06:01.926
It's senior prank week.

06:02.014 --> 06:03.369
Oh. I wish I'd known that

06:03.457 --> 06:05.340
before I sent your mom
this text.

06:05.495 --> 06:08.098
"It's starting.
Hide the bananas."

06:11.603 --> 06:14.356
- Seriously?!
- The Kepler Award?

06:14.444 --> 06:15.697
Is this
where you're going,

06:15.785 --> 06:18.088
'cause it looks like
it's a big deal?

06:18.176 --> 06:20.113
It's just a boring reception
or finalists.

06:20.201 --> 06:21.824
Well, I love
a good reception.

06:21.912 --> 06:22.887
What time
are we expected?

06:22.975 --> 06:24.793
Oh, I don't think
I'm allowed to bring guests.

06:24.881 --> 06:26.473
Says here,
"families welcome."

06:26.561 --> 06:27.738
But I didn't RSVP.

06:27.826 --> 06:29.699
Says here,
"walk-ins encouraged."

06:29.787 --> 06:32.043
What an informative flyer.

06:32.143 --> 06:34.231
Awesome.
Let's do this.

06:39.178 --> 06:40.729
Yoga, right?

06:40.817 --> 06:42.400
No winners, no losers,

06:42.488 --> 06:43.856
no "who's best?"

06:43.957 --> 06:46.971
You want me to tell you
that you are the only one

06:47.059 --> 06:48.977
that didn't need help
from the teacher?

06:49.065 --> 06:50.231
Was I?

06:51.051 --> 06:53.192
- Janice. Hi.
- Hi.

06:53.301 --> 06:55.807
This is Claire,
my husband's daughter.

06:55.895 --> 06:56.697
- Hi.
- Hi.

06:56.785 --> 06:58.986
So, that makes Gloria kind
of like your step mother.

06:59.074 --> 07:00.346
Yeah, we don't
do that.

07:00.434 --> 07:01.729
- Oh.
- Um, anyways,

07:01.817 --> 07:03.689
how is
your new boyfriend?

07:03.777 --> 07:05.229
Pretty great.

07:05.317 --> 07:07.018
I do feel
a little awkward

07:07.106 --> 07:08.494
about the age difference, though.

07:08.582 --> 07:10.079
Ooh, which way
are we talking?

07:10.167 --> 07:12.689
He's, uh,
in his early 20s.

07:12.777 --> 07:14.517
- Oh!
- Noice!

07:14.605 --> 07:16.041
Isn't that
embarrassing?

07:16.128 --> 07:18.087
No.
I say go for it.

07:18.175 --> 07:20.025
Ooh, I like
this new Claire

07:20.113 --> 07:21.790
that says "yes"
to things.

07:21.878 --> 07:23.978
Before, you would belike, uh...

07:24.066 --> 07:25.954
what is the word
for grouchy?

07:26.042 --> 07:27.681
I don't think
it matters now.

07:27.769 --> 07:29.517
Early 20s, huh.

07:29.605 --> 07:31.463
Well, you're still beating
gravity at that point.

07:31.550 --> 07:33.517
I bet everything
is right where it should be.

07:33.605 --> 07:35.119
- Oh, yes.
- Yeah.

07:35.207 --> 07:37.339
Check out
this selfie he sent

07:37.427 --> 07:38.574
of his abs.

07:38.662 --> 07:40.225
Damn!

07:40.399 --> 07:41.378
Mm.

07:41.466 --> 07:42.587
It's so nice to be with

07:42.675 --> 07:44.230
someone
who takes care of himself,

07:44.318 --> 07:45.957
not like the guys
my age.

07:46.045 --> 07:47.178
Tell me about it.

07:47.266 --> 07:48.869
Jay's starting to give up
a little bit.

07:48.975 --> 07:50.504
You know, in the way
that he's dressing.

07:50.591 --> 07:52.105
Mm.
Why don't you bring

07:52.227 --> 07:54.410
your guy by the house
to remind Jay

07:54.498 --> 07:57.411
that women like a man
that make a little effort.

07:57.499 --> 07:59.410
Um, well, we're freelater
today, if that works.

07:59.498 --> 08:01.996
Perfect. And, Claire, you come, too,
so that you help me

08:02.084 --> 08:04.238
nudge Jay
in the right direction.

08:04.326 --> 08:05.832
Well, I wouldn't want
my first "no"

08:05.920 --> 08:08.589
- to be to my step mother.
- I said we're not doing that.

08:10.677 --> 08:12.097
Cam, hurry!

08:12.185 --> 08:13.247
If we get there
early enough,

08:13.334 --> 08:15.028
we get to submit a question
about Greenspan.

08:15.115 --> 08:16.582
I got a doozy
about stag-flation.

08:16.670 --> 08:18.173
- Just hear me out.
- You...

08:18.261 --> 08:20.730
- We decided...
- No, you decided.

08:20.818 --> 08:22.379
And, Mitchell, we had so
much fun last night.

08:22.466 --> 08:24.121
Lily's gone
for one more night.

08:24.209 --> 08:26.839
Let's go out!
Come on. Have some fun.

08:26.927 --> 08:28.457
And break our
two-night-in-a-row rule?

08:28.545 --> 08:30.458
No, no.
I don't think so.

08:30.546 --> 08:32.179
Okay, you slept
two hours last night.

08:32.267 --> 08:33.965
You know you hit a wall
when you get over tired.

08:34.052 --> 08:36.534
It's very intense.
You know what I think this is?

08:36.583 --> 08:38.113
I think you're worried that
you can't keep up

08:38.200 --> 08:39.730
- with me and my youthful spirit.
- Mm.

08:39.818 --> 08:41.847
The other day, you called
a refrigerator an icebox.

08:41.934 --> 08:43.619
That's not old, that's country cute.

08:43.707 --> 08:45.892
Okay. Let's face it.
You were born 50,

08:45.980 --> 08:48.949
and I've always been
young at heart.

08:49.037 --> 08:51.102
And you know what?
Maybe that's what attracted you

08:51.190 --> 08:53.863
to me in the first place...
My boyish charm.

08:53.951 --> 08:56.886
And you were an older,
seasoned man who came and...

08:57.468 --> 09:00.042
seduced me,
Mr. Robinson.

09:00.130 --> 09:02.249
Okay, yeah,
that's a youthful reference.

09:02.337 --> 09:04.106
You should trot that out
with your new friends.

09:04.193 --> 09:05.506
Cam, this is
so you, okay?

09:05.594 --> 09:06.937
You're running
yourself ragged

09:07.025 --> 09:08.199
trying to remain young.

09:08.287 --> 09:10.500
I mean, there's nothing wrong
with accepting the fact

09:10.588 --> 09:11.682
that you're getting
a little older.

09:11.769 --> 09:13.642
Unless you're admitting it
too soon.

09:13.730 --> 09:15.488
You don't want to look
upone day and think,

09:15.576 --> 09:17.058
"Oh, what did I
forget to do?

09:17.146 --> 09:18.941
Oh, yeah. Live."

09:19.177 --> 09:20.878
Well, you know what?
If you need me,

09:20.966 --> 09:23.605
I'm gonna be pre-gaming
in Binker's loft in...

09:23.693 --> 09:25.574
an abandoned cannery

09:25.704 --> 09:27.447
in the old
pickle district.

09:27.597 --> 09:29.144
- Sounds drafty.
- Yeah.

09:30.887 --> 09:32.386
<i>Nice roll.</i>

09:32.474 --> 09:34.769
The bocce situation
was worse than I feared.

09:34.887 --> 09:36.128
I had to get the range back

09:36.216 --> 09:38.402
in the hands of
the Sunrise Swingers.

09:38.892 --> 09:41.321
Listen, I, uh,
got to be discreet.

09:41.409 --> 09:43.542
Uh, I'm sort of
behind enemy lines here.

09:43.661 --> 09:45.574
But, uh,
if I'm not mistaken,

09:45.832 --> 09:47.339
you're a fellow, uh,

09:47.598 --> 09:48.901
- "swinger."
- Excuse me?

09:48.989 --> 09:51.230
No, no, it's okay. I'm cool.
It's just that I, uh...

09:51.496 --> 09:53.020
I'm trying to get something
started here.

09:53.107 --> 09:55.691
I mean, uh, of course
we have to meet in secrecy,

09:55.779 --> 09:57.382
but I don't mind
hosting at my house.

09:57.470 --> 09:59.653
- Are you actually suggesting...
- Lady, wake up.

09:59.741 --> 10:01.614
Our way of life
is under attack.

10:01.702 --> 10:03.159
Pretty soon,
there won't be enough of us

10:03.246 --> 10:04.238
for a decent foursome.

10:04.326 --> 10:05.300
I have to go.

10:05.388 --> 10:06.781
Okay. Well, just think about it.

10:06.869 --> 10:08.912
- That's all. Just think about it.
- Okay.

10:09.109 --> 10:10.902
- Worth a shot, huh?
- What?

10:11.082 --> 10:12.527
No, that's not
what I meant.

10:12.615 --> 10:14.511
Oh, that's what you
bocceplayers are about, huh?

10:14.599 --> 10:16.636
You find something nice,
and you ruin it.

10:19.537 --> 10:20.785
That's Dr. Stieglitz.

10:20.873 --> 10:22.738
He makes the final decision
on the award.

10:22.856 --> 10:25.535
He's brilliant and scary
and impossible to impress.

10:25.623 --> 10:26.958
Hey, I know this is
your dad talking,

10:27.045 --> 10:28.644
but you're pretty brilliant
and scary

10:28.763 --> 10:30.207
and impossible
yourself.

10:31.538 --> 10:33.191
Okay. I've made
an appearance.

10:33.279 --> 10:35.542
I think we can go.
Come on, now, Alex.

10:35.630 --> 10:36.775
This is a party
in your honor,

10:36.862 --> 10:38.751
and you're here withyour
own personal cheerleader.

10:38.838 --> 10:40.064
- Dad, I just...
- I know how to pump up

10:40.151 --> 10:42.602
an academic crowd.
I had to cheerfor the debate team once.

10:42.704 --> 10:45.766
"Be persuasive,
B-E persuasive."

10:47.047 --> 10:49.157
- "B-E P-E-R-S..."
- That's enough.

10:49.642 --> 10:52.274
"Damn. Might as well
ask Schrodinger's cat."

10:55.225 --> 10:56.375
Pets.

10:56.463 --> 10:59.063
I once had a macaw that
could use a remote control.

10:59.151 --> 11:01.282
Watched a lot of cable.
You'd think, uh...

11:01.370 --> 11:03.893
You'd think Animal Planet,
but it was mostly Cinemax.Ah.

11:04.023 --> 11:05.329
I'm Alex's dad.

11:05.634 --> 11:07.180
Alex, get in here.

11:07.298 --> 11:10.561
Actually, I was referring
to a thought experiment

11:10.829 --> 11:13.501
concerning a paradox
in quantum mechanics.

11:14.375 --> 11:16.938
Yes, quite, quite.

11:18.078 --> 11:20.352
Where are you all from
originally?

11:20.845 --> 11:22.368
It was so embarrassing.

11:22.618 --> 11:24.665
Professor Stieglitz is a genius.

11:24.753 --> 11:27.016
He doesn't fall for people
who pretend to understand him

11:27.104 --> 11:28.821
by saying things
like "Quite, quite,"

11:28.909 --> 11:30.962
or, "Indeed," or...

11:31.050 --> 11:33.110
Touché, my good man!

11:33.527 --> 11:35.665
But seriously,
I-I have a science question

11:35.753 --> 11:38.032
- I've always wondered about.
- Uh, maybekeep wondering.

11:38.238 --> 11:41.782
Would there be a safe amount
of helium you could give a baby

11:41.909 --> 11:44.042
that would lift it
off the ground?

11:44.168 --> 11:45.040
What?

11:45.128 --> 11:47.337
Oh. I don't
want it to float away.

11:47.425 --> 11:49.298
I-I just want it
to have fun.

11:52.345 --> 11:53.673
Can we...

11:55.622 --> 11:56.946
Could you
do me a favor?

11:57.052 --> 11:59.196
I'm having a package delivered
to my dorm room,

11:59.284 --> 12:00.799
and someone needs to
be thereto sign for it.

12:00.886 --> 12:01.929
Can't your roommate
do it?

12:02.017 --> 12:03.743
No. She got deported.

12:03.831 --> 12:05.204
I thought she was
from Arkansas.

12:05.292 --> 12:07.295
Yeah, but her parents were...

12:07.484 --> 12:08.397
traitors.

12:08.485 --> 12:10.235
- Beth and Allen?
- Don't feel bad.

12:10.327 --> 12:11.524
We all fell for it.

12:11.612 --> 12:13.575
So you want me to go back
to your dorm room

12:13.663 --> 12:15.486
and sit and wait
for a package?

12:15.574 --> 12:16.891
Yes.

12:17.553 --> 12:20.563
Oh, sh-shoot, honey.
I...

12:21.499 --> 12:25.079
I have a delivery coming back
to the house, too, so...

12:25.562 --> 12:26.655
I should run.

12:27.023 --> 12:29.735
- Well, if you have to.
- Yeah. I'm so sorry.

12:30.054 --> 12:33.064
But, hey,
good luck, okay?

12:33.791 --> 12:35.271
Bye, Dad.

12:39.347 --> 12:41.243
Uh, did I
seem a little...

12:41.331 --> 12:43.860
Zero Kelvin?
Cold. Yeah.

12:44.097 --> 12:45.095
So you think I was...

12:45.183 --> 12:46.667
Like the sum of a groupof
numbers divided by

12:46.754 --> 12:49.274
the numberof those numbers?
Mean.

12:49.519 --> 12:51.977
This is why no one wants
to code with you, Tina.

13:01.709 --> 13:04.421
Hey. How in the world
did you find me?

13:04.797 --> 13:07.288
You know that app you can puton
kids' phones to track them?

13:07.376 --> 13:09.859
You put one on my phone
after I surprised you today?

13:10.003 --> 13:12.327
Don't make me feel
worse than I already do.

13:13.187 --> 13:14.940
Wait a minute.
You won?!

13:15.046 --> 13:16.827
Congratulations!

13:16.915 --> 13:19.310
Please don't be happy for me.
I can't take it.

13:19.398 --> 13:20.900
I was
such a jerk to you.

13:21.101 --> 13:24.340
No, honey, I get it.
I, uh...

13:24.427 --> 13:26.210
I know I can
be embarrassing. I...

13:26.374 --> 13:28.082
I just get nervous
around smart people.

13:28.170 --> 13:29.734
Sometimes even you.

13:30.345 --> 13:31.966
The first time I ever said
"quite, quite"

13:32.054 --> 13:33.514
was when you were 6 years old
and you just told me

13:33.601 --> 13:35.452
about how plants
make carbon dioxide.

13:35.540 --> 13:37.288
This may surprise you, but...

13:38.023 --> 13:39.610
sometimes I wishl was more like you,

13:40.054 --> 13:42.812
the way you're always
able to enjoy life.

13:43.281 --> 13:45.466
Believe it or not, I felt
the same way about my dad.

13:45.577 --> 13:47.400
I'm a... I'm a pessimist
compared to him.

13:47.487 --> 13:49.599
And his dad
actually suffered

13:49.687 --> 13:51.500
from a smile-induced
hernia.

13:52.249 --> 13:53.280
It's prank week,

13:53.367 --> 13:56.124
and I spent the whole time
in the library.

13:56.627 --> 13:58.045
Sometimes I feel like
I just went through

13:58.132 --> 13:59.850
the four best years
of my life,

14:00.054 --> 14:02.070
only I forgot
to make them

14:02.187 --> 14:04.210
the four best years
of my life.

14:04.543 --> 14:06.195
Well, college
isn't over.

14:07.373 --> 14:08.708
And I just may be able
to help you

14:08.796 --> 14:10.242
make up for
a little lost time.

14:10.330 --> 14:12.169
Hot Wing Trivia's
about to start.

14:12.257 --> 14:14.202
I have you guys registered
as "The Dunphys"?

14:14.297 --> 14:15.452
How did you...?

14:15.570 --> 14:16.812
You knew I was coming?

14:16.900 --> 14:19.851
Let's not forget where you learned
about that tracking app.

14:20.579 --> 14:22.913
And there's one tiny change.

14:23.072 --> 14:25.695
We're actually
the MacDunphys.

14:28.267 --> 14:31.410
Only my dad would think
that a trivia game...

14:31.497 --> 14:33.537
The Triangle Shirtwaist Fire.

14:34.304 --> 14:36.421
...where you balance hats
on your head,

14:36.733 --> 14:38.005
drink beer as a reward...

14:38.093 --> 14:39.796
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

14:39.898 --> 14:42.381
...and
eat hot wings as a punishment...

14:42.506 --> 14:44.569
Millard Fillmore!

14:45.976 --> 14:49.273
...needed that one last twist
of a Scottish accent.

14:49.361 --> 14:52.630
Dopey, Sneezy...

14:52.718 --> 14:54.860
and Grumpy?

14:54.947 --> 14:57.906
Yeah!

14:58.163 --> 14:59.923
Whoever said the most
important thing in life

15:00.046 --> 15:01.452
is winning awards...

15:04.527 --> 15:06.140
...wasn't all wrong.

15:10.734 --> 15:13.763
I still remember
the day Mr. Greenspan

15:13.851 --> 15:16.835
coined the term
"irrational exuberance."

15:16.929 --> 15:19.280
He had taken
a longer than usual tub

15:19.452 --> 15:21.720
and, as he sat
in the soapy water...

15:21.807 --> 15:23.577
I had made a mistake.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.218
Cam was off on an adventure

15:25.306 --> 15:27.367
while I sat there
dying of boredom,

15:27.457 --> 15:31.070
surrounded by people
dying of natural causes.

15:31.718 --> 15:33.429
I'm gonna keep
the bounce going, okay?

15:33.517 --> 15:34.850
- Keep the bounce going.
- Yeah, you know, it's a little more

15:34.937 --> 15:36.694
- sass in the neck, because...
- Oh, my gosh!

15:36.781 --> 15:38.156
Mitchell,
what are you doing here?

15:38.244 --> 15:40.413
- What about the lecture?
- Well, uh, it was deadly.

15:40.501 --> 15:42.023
Yeah, I'm getting old
before my time.

15:42.111 --> 15:43.858
Please take me with you!
Make me young again!

15:43.945 --> 15:46.015
Oh, my gosh,
we're so happy you're here.

15:46.103 --> 15:47.446
Really? Yeah, of course.

15:47.534 --> 15:50.663
- No "I told you so"?
- No. That's nothow my generation does it.

15:50.751 --> 15:52.593
Well, check you out,
still going strong.

15:52.696 --> 15:55.090
Yeah, you know what? I think I'm
just feeding off the energy,

15:55.177 --> 15:56.453
because I haven't
felt this awake in...

15:56.540 --> 15:57.553
- Hold on just a second.
- Hm?

15:57.640 --> 15:59.546
Yo, blue guy!
Hey, blue shirt!

15:59.679 --> 16:00.970
What's up, bro? Hey!

16:01.057 --> 16:02.414
You looking at me?
What do you want to do?

16:02.501 --> 16:04.157
You want to dance?
Why is he staring at me?

16:04.244 --> 16:06.757
You know, you know, I don't
think he was looking at you.

16:06.845 --> 16:08.279
It seems like he's looking at me.
What's...

16:08.366 --> 16:09.593
Are you getting
a little tired?

16:09.681 --> 16:11.127
Oh, please.
Can a tired guy do this?

16:11.215 --> 16:13.528
Da! Hey, I love these guys!
Whoa.

16:13.616 --> 16:16.439
Oh, did you know Daryl...
Daryl's mom was the runner-up

16:16.527 --> 16:18.140
in the Miss Illinois
pageant

16:18.228 --> 16:20.452
in 1990?!

16:20.540 --> 16:22.632
♪ The year
I graduated ♪

16:22.737 --> 16:24.080
♪ Daryl's mom
was hot ♪

16:24.175 --> 16:25.924
- Ow!
- Fantastic.

16:26.012 --> 16:28.010
Cam, I think you might be
hitting that wall.

16:28.098 --> 16:29.596
No, no, no, I'm fine.
I would...

16:29.684 --> 16:31.401
What's this clown
staring at? Hey!

16:31.527 --> 16:33.310
No, no, no, no, no,
don't point at me.

16:33.398 --> 16:34.619
I'll rip
your finger off

16:34.707 --> 16:36.167
and feed it to
your red-headed girlfriend!

16:36.254 --> 16:37.549
Okay, that is a mirror. Huh?

16:37.637 --> 16:39.846
And I knew this sweater
made me look busty.

16:39.934 --> 16:42.018
Okay, w-w-why is
my hand shaking?

16:42.106 --> 16:43.472
Did somebody put something
in my drink?

16:43.559 --> 16:47.057
Hey! Did one of
you Ritalin-addicted millennial

16:47.145 --> 16:50.058
scooter jockeys
dose me? Huh?

16:50.246 --> 16:52.469
What, you think you can take
this tree down, do you?

16:52.579 --> 16:54.792
Well, guess what!
I'm a redwood!

16:54.880 --> 16:56.933
That's right, I was
here before you were born,

16:57.021 --> 16:58.370
and I'll be here
after you're gone!

16:58.457 --> 16:59.400
- Okay, okay.
- Yeah!

16:59.488 --> 17:01.244
He gets like this.
He just needs a nap.

17:01.332 --> 17:02.549
- Nap time.
- Okay.

17:02.637 --> 17:03.863
- Nap. Let's go.
- No, I don't want to go, though!

17:03.950 --> 17:05.159
- I like my new friends!
- Yeah, I know.

17:05.246 --> 17:06.932
Do you guys like me?
'Cause I like you!

17:07.020 --> 17:08.242
- Yeah.
- I want to stay! Hey!

17:08.330 --> 17:09.573
And I'm really sorry
about everything.

17:09.660 --> 17:10.925
- You got to let him go.
- No, I'm sorry.

17:11.012 --> 17:12.097
You got to let him go.
It's okay.

17:12.184 --> 17:12.915
- Thank you.
- I'm so sorry.

17:13.003 --> 17:13.743
- Bye-bye.
- I didn't know

17:13.832 --> 17:15.260
- you weren't staring at me.
- Shh.

17:15.348 --> 17:17.657
- It's okay.
- No, I don't want to go.

17:18.720 --> 17:21.713
I nailed my monologues
for the Elizabethan Society.

17:21.800 --> 17:23.934
Methinks you're looking
at a brand-new Lizzie.

17:24.040 --> 17:24.992
So it is "methinks."

17:25.080 --> 17:26.470
So, why does
Jay correct me

17:26.558 --> 17:28.208
every time I say that?

17:29.543 --> 17:33.049
Jay, we have company!
Do not hide in the bedroom.

17:35.078 --> 17:36.018
- Hello.
- Hi.

17:36.106 --> 17:37.502
Thank you for coming.

17:37.590 --> 17:40.065
Where's the boyfriend?
He's just parking.

17:40.153 --> 17:43.362
And, you know, we realized
something on the way over,

17:43.450 --> 17:44.847
and it's a little awkward.

17:45.144 --> 17:46.887
Those are my
hors d'oeuvres. I'll be back.

17:46.975 --> 17:48.894
- Make yourself a drink.
- Okay.

17:50.283 --> 17:51.613
Hey, hot stuff.

17:51.769 --> 17:53.812
Are you sure
this isn't a little weird?

17:53.900 --> 17:56.808
Well, I wasn't expecting
the couple we'd be helping out

17:56.896 --> 17:59.097
to be my grandpa and his wife,
but...

17:59.225 --> 18:00.764
our relationship
was gonna be out

18:00.852 --> 18:02.020
- in the open eventually.
- Yeah.

18:02.107 --> 18:04.050
I kind of bragged about
itto everyone I know.

18:04.138 --> 18:05.871
Oh, you're so sweet.

18:06.957 --> 18:08.183
My daughter.

18:08.283 --> 18:11.191
She wants to have friends over.
I said no parties.

18:11.294 --> 18:12.604
Hey, you relax.

18:14.634 --> 18:17.691
Denise, your mother and
I deserve one night off.

18:19.579 --> 18:20.527
Oh!

18:20.649 --> 18:21.972
The lady from the club!

18:22.060 --> 18:23.882
Either she didn't know
I was Gloria's husband

18:23.970 --> 18:25.623
and things were about
to get very awkward,

18:25.875 --> 18:28.269
or she did know
and she was here to follow up

18:28.357 --> 18:30.280
on my accidental proposition.

18:30.520 --> 18:32.058
God, I hate company!

18:33.415 --> 18:34.964
Hey, hot stuff.

18:35.120 --> 18:36.303
Where's your boy toy?

18:36.391 --> 18:38.425
Oh, he's making
a phone call.

18:38.520 --> 18:39.519
Got to say, though,

18:39.607 --> 18:42.300
I feel kind of awkward
because, turns out,

18:42.388 --> 18:44.441
- he's related to Gloria.
- What?

18:44.963 --> 18:47.793
My daughter. I have
to handle this. Sorry.

18:48.973 --> 18:50.707
Claire,
I have big news.

18:50.831 --> 18:52.901
Oh, God. If it's what
I think it is,

18:52.989 --> 18:55.032
I don't know
if that's a good idea.

18:55.120 --> 18:56.253
I know.
People will say

18:56.341 --> 18:58.082
I've taken my love
of old things too far.

18:58.170 --> 18:59.473
- Mm-hmm.
- But I'm happy.

18:59.671 --> 19:02.496
And not to brag, butl'm the
first Latinoto get in there.

19:02.592 --> 19:05.560
Oh, boy. I feel sort of
responsible for this.

19:05.648 --> 19:08.051
Um, I think it has a little
moreto do with my performance.

19:08.202 --> 19:09.325
I distinguished myself

19:09.413 --> 19:11.416
when I did literally
all the girl parts.

19:11.526 --> 19:14.832
I need to go splash
some water on my face.

19:14.920 --> 19:15.936
Wait a minute.

19:16.024 --> 19:17.261
Have you
been doing sit-ups?

19:17.349 --> 19:18.522
Oh, every night
for stamina.

19:18.610 --> 19:20.349
I would not have been
able to perform without it.

19:20.436 --> 19:22.230
I even threw in
some tongue exercises

19:22.318 --> 19:23.894
because my "Shrew"
was taking forever.

19:25.293 --> 19:26.316
Oh, God.

19:26.404 --> 19:27.868
Dad, what are you hiding from?

19:27.956 --> 19:29.613
You'll know after I tell you

19:29.701 --> 19:31.371
what I said to that woman
from the club.

19:31.648 --> 19:33.050
What is she doing here?

19:33.138 --> 19:34.799
She's trying to get you
out of those clothes.

19:34.886 --> 19:36.238
- You know?
- Yes!

19:36.326 --> 19:37.707
We talked
about it at yoga.

19:37.795 --> 19:38.816
It was Gloria's idea.

19:38.908 --> 19:40.535
I just came along
to grease the wheels.

19:40.623 --> 19:42.707
What?!
I was almost considering it

19:42.795 --> 19:43.928
until you added
that part.

19:44.016 --> 19:45.519
I gotta splash water
on my face.

19:47.197 --> 19:48.910
This place is dead.
Want to bounce?

19:48.998 --> 19:50.425
No, we don't
have to be around

19:50.513 --> 19:52.347
a big group of people
to have fun.

19:53.331 --> 19:55.182
Luke, no!

19:55.270 --> 19:57.013
She has a boyfriend.

19:57.101 --> 19:58.402
Yeah, me.

19:58.490 --> 20:01.103
No, it's some young guy
from the club...

20:01.242 --> 20:02.582
Oh, boy.

20:04.154 --> 20:06.507
Gloria,
do you know

20:06.595 --> 20:08.472
what's going on
with Manny?

20:08.957 --> 20:11.800
Uh, do you think that
he can keep that a secret?

20:11.888 --> 20:14.761
They have to wear
all kind of weird outfits

20:14.849 --> 20:16.324
every time they do it.

20:16.604 --> 20:18.384
Hey, Ma.

20:19.216 --> 20:21.816
Luke... Luke, get your
hands off Manny's girlfriend.

20:21.904 --> 20:23.603
- That's not my girlfriend.
- What?

20:23.691 --> 20:25.254
Then what were we
just talking about?

20:25.342 --> 20:27.746
The Elizabethan Society.
M-My first meeting's tonight.

20:27.834 --> 20:30.246
I'm so confused.
It's plain as day.

20:31.263 --> 20:33.386
This woman is here
to swing with me.

20:33.544 --> 20:35.587
That's it. That's where
I draw the line.

20:35.675 --> 20:37.535
How did this
happen?

20:37.623 --> 20:38.894
I'll tell you
how this happened.

20:38.982 --> 20:41.115
Because nobody
was willing to say

20:41.203 --> 20:42.910
what needs to be said.

20:43.363 --> 20:46.082
No. No. No.

20:46.170 --> 20:47.649
And hell no.

20:53.502 --> 20:55.876
It's how you feel about
the B-minus, Denise,

20:55.964 --> 20:57.626
not how your mother and I
feel about it.

20:57.735 --> 21:00.430
No, I'm not saying no
to the Amsterdam trip.

21:00.626 --> 21:02.702
Yeah, it sounds like
a fun summer,

21:02.790 --> 21:05.665
but how is that gonna look
on a college application?

21:06.468 --> 21:07.971
We'll talk about it later.

21:08.329 --> 21:10.110
Of course
I'm proud of you.

21:11.030 --> 21:12.163
Hey, Mom.

21:12.251 --> 21:13.627
Hey, Luke. Honey,
would you mind getting me

21:13.714 --> 21:15.219
that salad bowl
off the top shelf?

21:15.307 --> 21:16.350
Yep.

21:16.438 --> 21:17.842
I know
I'm the only one,

21:17.930 --> 21:19.940
but it is
my favorite.

21:20.132 --> 21:22.540
Don't apologize, Mom.
You know what you like.

21:23.090 --> 21:24.585
Never mind.
I'm good.
