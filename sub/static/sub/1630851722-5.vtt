Both teams frantically working

08:35.274 --> 08:36.274
on the right side of their car.

08:37.551 --> 08:41.067
But Savage Crew, switching sides
just ahead of Dirty Hands.

08:41.102 --> 08:42.931
Quincey waiting to see
if the tire's on

08:42.965 --> 08:44.861
before he lets the car down.

08:44.895 --> 08:47.413
-Dirty Hands right
behind Savage Crew.
-KALIMBA: Doing it now.

08:47.447 --> 08:48.793
KEOGHAN:
Hanger's got the car up.

08:48.826 --> 08:51.102
Savage Crew,
back left-hand tire coming off.

Doing good, doing good.

-Dirty Hands, very close.

uh, Christine and I,

08:57.895 --> 08:59.517
lining up the-the holes
in the rim

08:59.551 --> 09:00.965
w-with the lugs,

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
and it's killing time.

09:06.517 --> 09:08.240
CHRISTINE:
I go to change my second tire,

09:08.274 --> 09:10.172
get it on there, get all
the bolts tightened down,

09:10.206 --> 09:12.379
and one nut was just
not going on.

-Drop!
-WILL: Go, go, go, go, go!

09:15.447 --> 09:18.274

with the fastest pit stop time

-so far.

09:25.620 --> 09:27.309

Whew, that was close!

09:27.344 --> 09:29.965
Savage Crew with the fastest
time on the first pit stop.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.240
Dirty Hands,
a few seconds behind.

09:32.274 --> 09:33.413
WILL:
Great job, that was awesome.

09:33.447 --> 09:35.136
Were we done before them, or no?

09:35.172 --> 09:36.826
Oh, you-- we had it won
until the...

09:36.861 --> 09:38.240
until this one jammed us.

09:38.274 --> 09:39.688
-That's my bad.
-TIM: We had it won.

09:39.724 --> 09:41.136
So, you going in square?

09:41.172 --> 09:42.309
CHRISTINE:
One nut was just not going on.

09:42.344 --> 09:43.826
It was just operator error.

09:43.861 --> 09:46.067
I stripped multiple studs.

09:46.102 --> 09:47.102
We got two more chances
to get it right.

09:47.136 --> 09:48.654
We'll be a'ight,
we'll be a'ight.

09:48.688 --> 09:49.793
TIM: All right, everybody,
in position here.

09:49.826 --> 09:53.688
KEOGHAN: Savage Crew with
the fastest time so far.

09:53.724 --> 09:55.172
But you get three shots at it.

09:55.206 --> 09:57.517
Dirty Hands,
let's see what you can do.

09:57.551 --> 09:59.274
Laser focused.

09:59.309 --> 10:00.654
WILL: They're gonna be coming
at this next one

10:00.688 --> 10:01.620
with everything they got.

10:01.654 --> 10:02.758
Okay, we got this.

10:02.793 --> 10:04.102
And they are coming in.

10:04.136 --> 10:06.793

Three, two, one.

QUINCEY:
I take one step,

10:10.000 --> 10:11.413
and-- bam!-- I hit the ground.

10:11.447 --> 10:12.826
[chuckles]:
I roll with the jack.

10:12.861 --> 10:14.000
KEOGHAN: Woah!
And Quincey goes down.

10:14.033 --> 10:15.000
[whirring]

10:15.033 --> 10:16.654
He's over the other side.

10:16.688 --> 10:18.102
He got delayed slightly,

10:18.136 --> 10:20.344
but two big pumps
and he has the car up.

10:20.379 --> 10:22.309
Lot of wasted fuel there
from Jerome.

10:22.344 --> 10:24.344
We'll be cleaning that up.

10:24.379 --> 10:26.102
Hanger on the other side
has the car up.

10:26.136 --> 10:28.620
Dirty Hands' air gun
disconnected from the air hose,

10:28.654 --> 10:30.654
losing valuable seconds.

10:30.688 --> 10:31.688

Go, go, go, go, go!

10:31.724 --> 10:33.931
My role is the tire carrier.

10:33.965 --> 10:37.447
As a cement mason,
I lift 80-pound bags of cement.

10:37.481 --> 10:40.172
60-pound tire, I feel like,
is kind of a light work for me.

10:40.206 --> 10:41.344

10:41.379 --> 10:42.931
KELSY:
Why is mine so slow?

10:42.965 --> 10:44.309
HANGER: Kelsy's pulling
the lug nuts off.

10:44.344 --> 10:46.620
She starts having
a difficult time.

10:46.654 --> 10:49.000
You got it. Take your time,
take your time.

10:49.033 --> 10:50.654
KELSY:
All I was doing was
trying to focus

10:50.688 --> 10:53.688
and make sure that those bolts
didn't get cockeyed.

10:53.724 --> 10:54.931

All right, drop it.

10:54.965 --> 10:56.344

KEOGHAN: Once again,

Damn it.

11:00.551 --> 11:01.861
KEOGHAN: And Dirty Hands finally
done! Playing catch-up again.

11:01.895 --> 11:02.758
Take them off,
take them off, take them off!

11:02.793 --> 11:04.379
Get that jack in!

11:04.413 --> 11:05.586
TIM:
Jack the car up a little more.

11:05.620 --> 11:07.654
Jack the car up.
Jack the car up.

11:09.067 --> 11:10.551
JEROME:
Up, up, up!

11:10.586 --> 11:12.240
QUINCEY: I didn't get the car
up high enough,

11:12.274 --> 11:14.344
so Christine and Lia couldn't
get their tire off.

11:14.379 --> 11:15.481
It was rubbing the ground.

11:15.517 --> 11:16.895
Can they catch up?

11:16.931 --> 11:18.344
-Quincey, with
a couple of pumps.

11:18.379 --> 11:20.309
KEOGHAN:
Savage Crew putting on
a second one.

11:20.344 --> 11:23.240
Second round, everything kind of
just fell apart.

11:23.274 --> 11:25.895
Oh, and they're delayed
over here at Dirty Hands.

11:25.931 --> 11:27.931
CHRISTINE:
When I pulled the tire off,
it striped to, like,

11:27.965 --> 11:29.654
multiple studs on the wheel.

KEOGHAN: And Savage Crew get
the second one again.

Two for two.

11:38.067 --> 11:42.033
KEOGHAN:
Oh, it's slow from Dirty Hands.

11:42.067 --> 11:45.517
[whoops] Savage Crew get
the fastest time again.

11:45.551 --> 11:47.895
-[cheering]
-$12,000 on the line

11:47.931 --> 11:50.724
for about a minute's work,
not bad.

11:50.758 --> 11:53.895
Remember, it's the fastest time
after three attempts

11:53.931 --> 11:55.172
that counts.

11:55.206 --> 11:57.309
Dirty Hands,
you still have a shot.

11:57.344 --> 12:00.274
Yeah, baby!
That's what I'm talking about!

12:00.309 --> 12:02.309
-Hey! Hey! Hey!

12:02.344 --> 12:04.067
One more time.

-KELSY: One more!
-One more time.

12:05.240 --> 12:07.309
Calm it down.
One more time.

12:07.344 --> 12:09.000
I'm kind of nervous
that we're celebrating

12:09.033 --> 12:10.447
because we're doing so well,

12:10.481 --> 12:12.379
and it's kind of
boosting our ego,

12:12.413 --> 12:14.620
and we need to be hungry
and stay humble.

12:14.654 --> 12:15.826
Stay focused.
It's the last one.

12:15.861 --> 12:16.826
Make it count.

12:16.861 --> 12:17.861
Yeah, I got it. I got it.

CHRISTINE:
Dealing with the-the,

12:20.309 --> 12:21.067
you know, the stripped threads
and stuff,

12:21.102 --> 12:22.965
it's just a setback.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.309
We were good the first time.

12:24.344 --> 12:26.000
It's just that one little nut,
slowed us up.

12:26.033 --> 12:28.000
At this point,
we have one pit stop left,

12:28.033 --> 12:29.274
and we're kind of a mess.

12:29.309 --> 12:31.413
I mean, do you think
we should switch, or no?

12:31.447 --> 12:33.000
I think if we can
get the jack higher

12:33.033 --> 12:35.758
and just be patient
and get that thing on straight.

12:35.793 --> 12:37.240

this third time.

Nothing matters at this point

except the fastest time.

12:53.413 --> 12:55.931
Savage Crew, you have set
the fastest time.

12:55.965 --> 12:58.102
You got to make sure
they don't catch up

-and get the fastest time.
-KELSY: We got it, Phil!

We've already beat Dirty Hands
out of the pits

got to do it one more time.

Coming in for the final stop.
Let's do it.

13:33.136 --> 13:35.688

The second round,
I was struggling.

13:35.724 --> 13:36.965
I couldn't even get
my wheel off.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
I stripped multiple studs,

13:39.033 --> 13:41.102
so I just need to slow down

13:41.136 --> 13:42.586
and make this one count
'cause this is our last chance

13:42.620 --> 13:46.067

Only a few seconds' work,
and you could win $12,000.

24:26.378 --> 24:29.067
Quincey with four tires
running into his station.

24:29.103 --> 24:31.103
Elizabeth yet to come back.

24:31.136 --> 24:33.240
I just put all my energy
in one area.

24:33.275 --> 24:35.034
HANGER:
Come on, Elizabeth!

24:35.067 --> 24:36.448
Let's go, everybody!
Let's go!

24:37.826 --> 24:40.964
Lia's already hard at work
on her first tire.

-Quincey's hard at work on his.

24:43.309 --> 24:44.275

Nobody has mounted a tire yet.

Come on, Christine.

24:50.344 --> 24:51.862
[air hisses]

24:51.895 --> 24:54.689
The proper way of using
a mounting machine is that

24:54.723 --> 24:57.000
you attach the air hose

24:57.034 --> 24:59.413
so that it fills
the inside of the tire...

24:59.448 --> 25:02.309
Pop, pop.
There goes the weasel.

25:02.344 --> 25:04.378
...and then creates the pressure
to pop it in place.

25:04.413 --> 25:06.550

Alfie!

-HANGER: Let's go, Alfie!

that first bead on.

working on that first tire.

25:16.067 --> 25:17.586
Come on, go, go, go.

25:17.619 --> 25:19.344
I've done almost
every trade there is.

25:19.378 --> 25:22.723
I've done roofing, electrical,
general contracting.

-But, uh...
-Uh-oh.

swinging around,

25:34.205 --> 25:35.654
I'm like, "Go, go, go."

Go, go, go, go, go, go.
Go, go, go, go, go.

25:37.240 --> 25:39.344
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

25:39.378 --> 25:40.344
-You got it.
-In my mind,

25:40.378 --> 25:41.654
I'm just like,
"Stay the course."

Jerome, Tak and Alfie

25:48.792 --> 25:50.378

her first tire mounted.

25:59.792 --> 26:03.309
as much as I can,
and it will not give.

26:10.792 --> 26:13.309

but I've never done this.

26:15.481 --> 26:16.964
KEOGHAN:
And second tire mounted
for Alfie.

-[popping]
-KEOGHAN: We hear tires popping
all over the place.

26:22.481 --> 26:24.931
Seems like they're flying
through it, and I'm just like,

"Mike, you're gonna be
at the bottom-bottom."

26:26.448 --> 26:28.067
Lineman Mike is struggling.

26:29.931 --> 26:32.103
MIKE:
I can't give up.

26:32.136 --> 26:35.067
Being a lineman, I know
how to keep a cool level head,

26:35.103 --> 26:36.723
because my work is so hazardous.

26:36.758 --> 26:39.136
You know, a split second,
I could be dead.

26:39.172 --> 26:41.000
But I have to clear
my mind and focus on

26:41.034 --> 26:42.931
what needs to be done.

26:42.964 --> 26:45.000
At the end of the day,
I want to go home to my family.

26:45.034 --> 26:48.240
-Mike has his first tire done.
-We love you, Mike!

26:48.275 --> 26:50.723
Christine, struggling
with that second tire.

26:50.758 --> 26:52.654
-Come on.
-I'm trying to do it
as fast as I can,

26:52.689 --> 26:54.723
but I keep screwing up.

26:54.758 --> 26:56.586
Oh, my God, dude.

26:56.619 --> 26:58.758
I'm starting to panic
a little bit

26:58.792 --> 27:01.034
'cause I do not want to be
in overtime again.

Kelsy, now with the second tire.

Do not give up on her.

-Jerome is smooth.
-JEROME: Once I got
that first tire on

in Hawaii right now.

working on that fourth tire.

27:25.517 --> 27:27.654
He wants to drive that race car
today.

But Tak and Lia are mounting
their fourth tire, too.

inside the rim.

Yeah!

Everybody else, keep going.
You know what happens.

27:53.758 --> 27:56.344
The last two to finish
are going into overtime.

Lia is a force to be
reckoned with.

the name Jill-of-all-trades.

where I just dropped to my knees

getting closer for me.

I'm a mechanic and people drive
on the stuff that I work on.

So I-I take pride in
doing my work with quality.

28:36.000 --> 28:37.448

the car around,

28:39.309 --> 28:41.067
but that's not
the important thing.

The important thing is that I
get the tire mounted correctly.

There's four of us left.
I got to get finished now,

28:45.309 --> 28:46.517

in the bottom two.

of overtime.

28:55.067 --> 28:59.586

let your tools do the work.

28:59.619 --> 29:01.172
This is the part I don't like.
