<b><font color="#0E7521">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

00:32.439 --> 00:35.193
<i>For the women of Nonnatus House,</i>

00:35.280 --> 00:39.910
<i>life was composed of countless
tender disciplines,</i>

00:40.080 --> 00:44.358
<i>for every word not spoken
in the precious nightly silence,</i>

00:44.480 --> 00:48.075
<i>prayers had to be offered
and rituals performed.</i>

01:05.920 --> 01:10.994
<i>For every sweet hour stolen,
there was penance paid.</i>

01:15.640 --> 01:18.632
<i>And even fleeting golden moments</i>

01:18.720 --> 01:21.996
<i>called for sacrifice and courage.</i>

01:22.080 --> 01:26.437
<i>Nothing came entirely easily.
And yet, all hardship was embraced,</i>

01:26.520 --> 01:29.114
<i>because that was the way the wind blew.</i>

01:29.200 --> 01:32.158
<i>That was the way that things were done.</i>

02:00.560 --> 02:02.039
Daisy.

02:02.120 --> 02:04.475
For crying out loud,
would you put a bit more into it?

02:04.560 --> 02:06.232
All right.

02:31.480 --> 02:33.198
Lou! Lou!

02:33.960 --> 02:37.430
Your mother ain't well.
Get up on that path and help her.

02:50.040 --> 02:51.234
I'm sure you deserved it.

02:54.280 --> 02:56.396
And a round of applause
to the Beverley Sisters.

02:56.480 --> 02:58.072
Better late than never.

02:58.160 --> 03:00.515
We're not late. It's 8:00 on the dot.

03:00.600 --> 03:03.096
If you spent less time lathering on
the eye black, Nurse Franklin,

03:03.120 --> 03:05.076
you'd have been down here
five minutes ago

03:05.160 --> 03:08.072
and ready to start work
at 8:00 on the dot.

03:08.160 --> 03:10.469
Like Sister Mary Cynthia.

03:11.360 --> 03:13.510
I'd be careful if I were you,
Nurse Mount.

03:13.600 --> 03:15.716
It may be October,
but there's plenty of flies

03:15.800 --> 03:16.949
still looking for a home.

03:18.560 --> 03:22.758
Good morning, Master Turner.
You're looking very spruce.

03:22.840 --> 03:24.114
New blazer?

03:24.200 --> 03:27.670
Yes. Although it's still purple,
unfortunately.

03:27.760 --> 03:30.228
So I see... Insulin?

03:30.320 --> 03:33.915
My mum asked to drop it off.
And she says can Sister Julienne

03:34.000 --> 03:35.797
call in at the practice,
after surgery hours.

03:35.880 --> 03:38.553
I'll tell her. She's already
asked to see me in her office.

03:38.640 --> 03:39.640
Thank you.

03:40.240 --> 03:44.756
Sister, your courage and your
forbearance over the few last weeks

03:44.840 --> 03:48.992
has been admirable
in every conceivable way.

03:49.120 --> 03:51.714
You have my absolute respect.

03:51.800 --> 03:56.430
Thank you. But I haven't done anything
out of the ordinary. I just carried on.

03:56.960 --> 03:59.474
And it is for that very reason
that I've wanted to send you

03:59.560 --> 04:02.199
to the motherhouse
ever since you were attacked.

04:02.280 --> 04:05.158
You deserve to spend time
in prayer and reflection.

04:05.240 --> 04:07.151
But I haven't been able to spare you.

04:07.240 --> 04:11.279
We have no idea when
Sister Evangelina will re-join us.

04:13.160 --> 04:14.752
Or even if.

04:15.480 --> 04:18.392
But she said she was going to
the Silent Order for six months.

04:19.320 --> 04:22.835
And the six months is over, and
we've scarcely heard a word from her.

04:23.360 --> 04:26.989
But why would she choose
an enclosed life?

04:27.080 --> 04:29.230
Why would she choose
to give up midwifery?

04:30.960 --> 04:34.919
There may not be a choice.
She may have found a different calling.

04:38.280 --> 04:41.795
A new superfluity of apples
abandoned upon our step.

04:41.880 --> 04:45.634
I think these are russets
and likely to be as hard as sweets.

04:45.720 --> 04:47.676
I'm quite sure that Mrs Bee

04:47.760 --> 04:49.830
can find something wonderful
to do with them.

04:50.480 --> 04:52.630
- Again?
- Again.

04:53.440 --> 04:56.910
Personally, I'm glad to be spared
another marrow.

05:37.520 --> 05:40.990
Midwife calling. Mrs Maitlin?

05:43.160 --> 05:44.639
Oh, get down.

05:45.360 --> 05:47.157
You could hurt yourself.

05:47.240 --> 05:48.798
I can't stop myself, Nurse.

05:49.080 --> 05:51.656
Yesterday, it was cleaning, and when
there was nothing left to clean,

05:51.680 --> 05:52.749
I started painting.

05:52.840 --> 05:55.376
Please let me finish up. I've only got
once more stroke with the brush.

05:55.400 --> 05:56.753
In which case, I shall do it.

05:57.240 --> 05:58.673
But it's not your job.

05:58.760 --> 06:01.399
My job is looking after you.
And that involves stopping you

06:01.520 --> 06:04.193
falling, A, off this chair
and, B, out of the window.

06:04.280 --> 06:07.511
Anyone falling would make
a right mess from eight floors up.

06:08.160 --> 06:09.639
It would be Tom and Jerry where they

06:09.720 --> 06:12.314
fall off the roof and leave
a cat-shaped hole in the pavement.

06:12.400 --> 06:14.311
Or a mouse-shaped hole.

06:14.400 --> 06:16.277
- Hello!
- Hello, love.

06:16.360 --> 06:17.475
What's happening?

06:17.560 --> 06:21.712
Your wife is in the grip of what's known
as the nesting instinct, Mr Maitlin.

06:21.880 --> 06:23.871
- She needed a bit of a hand.
- Thanks.

06:27.800 --> 06:31.031
I must say, this is one of the nicest
flats I've been to.

06:31.120 --> 06:34.078
We had a wedding list. There was one
in <i>Woman's Own</i> you could cut out.

06:34.160 --> 06:36.515
We got the lot except
for the sherry glasses.

06:36.600 --> 06:38.113
Pretty much everything we wanted.

06:38.200 --> 06:39.349
Didn't we, Leslie?

06:48.840 --> 06:52.037
So, the contraceptive pill.

06:52.120 --> 06:54.998
Licenced for distribution
within weeks.

06:55.080 --> 06:58.277
It's been talked about for so long,
it's hardly a surprise.

06:58.760 --> 07:00.398
No.

07:00.480 --> 07:02.277
But it is a challenge.

07:02.360 --> 07:04.430
Erm, of course it's a challenge, Sister.

07:05.200 --> 07:06.997
Antibiotics were a challenge, once.

07:07.480 --> 07:09.869
Antibiotics were also a miracle.

07:09.960 --> 07:12.793
And you think
the contraceptive pill isn't?

07:14.240 --> 07:18.199
It's a miracle with moral implications,
Dr Turner.

07:19.320 --> 07:21.993
With other forms
of contraception,

07:22.080 --> 07:25.311
you refer the patient
to a family planning clinic,

07:25.400 --> 07:27.868
which you can't do
unless they're married.

07:27.960 --> 07:31.430
Exactly, but with the pill
the Minister for Health

07:31.520 --> 07:33.431
has issued no such guidelines.

07:33.520 --> 07:37.115
- Yet...
- And that's the most exciting thing.

07:37.200 --> 07:40.875
If I can prescribe it,
single women will benefit, too.

07:41.560 --> 07:42.629
Quite.

07:42.720 --> 07:45.792
You know the statistics as well as I do.

07:45.880 --> 07:48.838
10% of babies in Poplar
are born illegitimate.

07:49.120 --> 07:50.960
With all the heartache
and stigma that implies.

07:53.520 --> 07:55.795
I don't doubt that you have
looked at this

07:55.880 --> 07:58.997
from every conceivable
medical and social angle.

07:59.840 --> 08:03.879
However, whilst there is nothing
in Anglican teaching

08:03.960 --> 08:05.552
to forbid birth control,

08:05.640 --> 08:09.519
the church does take a view
on matters of morality.

08:11.080 --> 08:13.992
As Mrs Turner, at least, will be aware.

08:15.720 --> 08:19.429
Well, of course. Have a lemon puff.

08:22.800 --> 08:24.677
Is there anything plainer?

08:26.440 --> 08:29.352
I have some Arrowroot Biscuits.
I'll pop and fetch them.

08:36.600 --> 08:40.639
- Tea is on the table, Sister.
- I shan't join you, today.

08:41.400 --> 08:44.437
I feel I need to spend
some quiet time in chapel.

08:44.520 --> 08:46.750
Perhaps you'll say grace instead?

08:47.120 --> 08:48.758
Of course.

09:18.360 --> 09:20.794
Everyone is out
on their evening rounds.

09:20.880 --> 09:23.189
Apart from me, because I'm on call.

09:23.560 --> 09:24.560
Good!

09:27.600 --> 09:30.672
Ooh! Have you bought shares
in Brylcreem?

09:30.760 --> 09:33.797
It's a funeral. People expect
a certain level of grooming.

09:34.160 --> 09:35.160
Oh.

09:38.320 --> 09:40.595
So, that's <i>Peggy May,</i>

09:41.120 --> 09:43.839
<i>Rose Willow, Golden Maid,</i>

09:43.920 --> 09:47.151
<i>Sweet Alice in Dordeen.</i>

09:47.240 --> 09:50.073
Sounds like a line-up of chorus girls.

09:51.360 --> 09:53.316
It's all rather quaint, really.

09:53.400 --> 09:56.073
I don't know why Nurse Crane
insisted we come down together.

09:56.480 --> 09:58.710
Oh, erm, little girl,

10:00.360 --> 10:02.590
do you know of a barge
called the <i>Molly Bell?</i>

10:03.280 --> 10:04.872
Yes, it's where I live.

10:05.600 --> 10:06.600
It's up there.

10:07.520 --> 10:09.795
Is your mother's name
Marguerite Blacker?

10:10.200 --> 10:11.599
Yeah, but they call her Daisy.

10:16.720 --> 10:19.234
You can always trust Trixie
to have the latest records in.

11:22.880 --> 11:24.393
It is good of you to come.

11:24.920 --> 11:26.319
But I'm feeling much better now.

11:26.800 --> 11:29.160
- Not that much better.
- Don't contradict your mother, Lou.

11:30.280 --> 11:31.336
They were good to her at the hospital,

11:31.360 --> 11:32.960
but they said
she was all right to leave.

11:33.360 --> 11:36.352
I'm sorry.
We've interrupted you during your meal.

11:37.360 --> 11:38.588
If you telephone this number,

11:38.960 --> 11:41.096
at any time of the day or night,
you can speak to a midwife

11:41.120 --> 11:42.872
about any aspect of your pregnancy.

11:43.600 --> 11:45.160
There's no need to make an appointment.

11:45.760 --> 11:46.909
Might not be here that long.

11:48.080 --> 11:50.594
Rumour of a chance of a cargo
going up to Manchester.

11:51.360 --> 11:52.360
But thank you.

11:54.400 --> 11:56.197
Lou, take that piece of paper
off the lady.

11:59.280 --> 12:01.714
Come on down. Have a look at her.

12:02.440 --> 12:04.078
No harm putting minds at rest.

12:12.440 --> 12:14.715
Don't know why I took on
so funny this morning.

12:15.720 --> 12:18.075
I was only working a lock,
and I do it all the time.

12:18.720 --> 12:20.597
Like me ma and me grandma did before me.

12:21.280 --> 12:23.669
Locks are women's work,
always have been.

12:24.080 --> 12:25.080
Like this.

12:25.760 --> 12:27.960
Well, if this is women's work,
you're rather good at it.

12:28.160 --> 12:29.752
Baby's heartbeat's wonderfully strong.

12:30.320 --> 12:32.754
Felt like a failure
being taken to the hospital,

12:33.280 --> 12:34.508
having them do blood tests.

12:35.240 --> 12:37.000
I should be able
to get the results tomorrow,

12:37.520 --> 12:40.398
and I can bring them here for you,
or you could come by our clinic.

12:41.360 --> 12:43.600
There are things we can give you
for your other children,

12:43.960 --> 12:47.714
free orange juice and so forth,
or rosehip syrup, if you prefer.

12:47.800 --> 12:48.800
Rosehip?

12:49.200 --> 12:52.192
You can do a lot with rosehips.
I make tea with them, sometimes.

12:54.440 --> 12:57.557
You've been awfully good to me,
but I really shouldn't keep you.

13:04.520 --> 13:05.520
Oh, Tom,

13:07.080 --> 13:08.354
people will be home soon.

13:10.040 --> 13:11.040
True.

13:16.600 --> 13:19.592
- Oh, no. Oh, Tom.
- What?

13:20.400 --> 13:22.038
The wall's covered in Brylcreem

13:22.520 --> 13:23.953
- from your head.
- No.

13:26.280 --> 13:27.280
Oh, it's not coming off.

13:28.520 --> 13:30.272
Oh, I'm just making it more shiny.

13:30.720 --> 13:33.359
Well, you'll have to say you tripped up
with the butter dish.

13:37.440 --> 13:39.590
Oh, Mr Hereward, what a nice surprise.

13:39.720 --> 13:42.188
You must have come to join us
for compline.

13:42.960 --> 13:45.713
Yes, I have. Indeed.

13:49.440 --> 13:50.589
Poor Mrs Blacker.

13:51.240 --> 13:53.435
It was like trying to get a bird
to eat out of my hand.

13:53.560 --> 13:55.437
One false move and she'd fly away.

13:56.200 --> 13:58.794
I wish it wasn't so hard to give help
to the people that need it.

13:59.320 --> 14:01.834
And do you know
none of those children go to school?

14:02.120 --> 14:03.997
I checked while you were in the cabin.

14:04.360 --> 14:05.713
The eldest, Lou, is already 11

14:05.800 --> 14:07.916
and I'm not sure
she can even read or write.

14:08.240 --> 14:09.840
The whole family's completely itinerant.

14:10.840 --> 14:13.070
Never in the same place
more than a week or so.

14:13.160 --> 14:15.151
They travel huge distances.

14:15.520 --> 14:17.192
There must be ways around that.

14:17.600 --> 14:18.936
Well, Mrs Blacker was quite surprised

14:18.960 --> 14:21.110
when I told her
all the things she was entitled to.

14:22.360 --> 14:25.591
Trouble is, I'm not sure
whether she wants to accept them.

14:30.680 --> 14:33.717
Barge people are a law unto themselves.

14:33.800 --> 14:35.233
They always were.

14:36.440 --> 14:39.876
They don't call them water gypsies
for no reason. I...

14:41.960 --> 14:45.430
Good grief. Where did that stain
on the wallpaper come from?

14:47.240 --> 14:49.754
- What stain?
- Oh, dear.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.752
I do hope
it's not another patch of damp.

14:51.840 --> 14:54.354
Sister Julienne's worried
the building's getting wet rot.

14:54.440 --> 14:56.715
Ooh, perhaps
it's just an optical illusion.

14:57.240 --> 14:58.832
Hmm, this isn't moisture.

14:59.840 --> 15:00.840
It's grease.

15:01.840 --> 15:05.879
I surmise a manifestation
from another realm.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.356
Spirits have been known to talk

15:09.440 --> 15:12.238
through the approbation
of strange substances.

15:13.080 --> 15:15.310
Well, whatever it is,
it's strange enough.

15:16.680 --> 15:19.797
- Smells rather masculine to me.
- Masculine?

15:20.760 --> 15:24.036
Hmm. Though, what it's doing
six feet up the wall is anybody's guess.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.719
- Good morning, ladies.
- Good morning.

15:28.160 --> 15:30.037
Nurse Crane
will issue the morning schedule

15:30.120 --> 15:31.235
after breakfast.

15:31.880 --> 15:37.557
But, this evening, I would like you all
to attend a special seminar

15:37.640 --> 15:39.073
here at Nonnatus House.

15:40.360 --> 15:43.591
I have an obligation this evening.
I have it every week.

15:44.840 --> 15:46.193
Of course. I'm sorry.

15:47.880 --> 15:51.634
After a great deal of prayer
and reflection,

15:52.080 --> 15:53.840
I have asked Dr Turner
to come and talk to us

15:53.880 --> 15:55.313
about the new contraceptive pill,

15:55.560 --> 15:58.472
which will be available
within the next few weeks.

15:58.560 --> 16:00.471
That's absolutely tremendous news.

16:01.520 --> 16:04.398
I've also invited
Mr Hereward to join us

16:04.760 --> 16:07.274
so he can give us
a Christian perspective.

16:07.360 --> 16:09.316
It's a shame Sister Evangelina
isn't here.

16:09.760 --> 16:11.716
She'd have had plenty to say
about it all.

16:12.360 --> 16:14.999
Sister Evangelina
has elected to be absent.

16:15.400 --> 16:17.868
We must proceed without her view.

16:27.680 --> 16:29.113
There were Worcesters today

16:29.920 --> 16:31.319
and there were crab apples,

16:31.760 --> 16:34.957
the latter still with the tang
of Epping Forest upon them.

16:35.200 --> 16:38.954
I'm sure no one will object to us
sharing our good fortune.

16:39.280 --> 16:42.829
Before you apply the term
"good fortune" to this glut,

16:43.280 --> 16:46.556
I suggest you hear
the opinion of my bowels.

16:48.600 --> 16:50.556
I sense this is a personal letter

16:50.640 --> 16:52.596
since you intend
to dispatch it yourself.

16:53.240 --> 16:55.037
Yes, it is.

16:55.880 --> 16:57.871
It is to Sister Evangelina.

16:59.600 --> 17:02.797
I did not think we should ever have
to plead with her.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
Nor did I.

17:05.119 --> 17:07.156
But time has passed,
and who knows what has passed

17:07.240 --> 17:08.958
between our sister and the Lord.

17:09.280 --> 17:12.078
And who knows what addlement
her mind has suffered,

17:13.000 --> 17:15.798
closeted in ostentatious silence.

17:17.200 --> 17:23.195
Evangelina is a woman
built for noise and motion.

17:23.760 --> 17:27.355
Designed to hear His voice
above the din of living.

17:28.040 --> 17:31.032
- Sister, please...
- You fear what will become of us

17:31.120 --> 17:32.599
if she does not return.

17:33.520 --> 17:36.273
I fear what will become of her.

17:37.160 --> 17:38.388
As do I.

17:39.400 --> 17:42.551
And now, I am going to post my letter.

18:09.080 --> 18:12.038
Oh, really good.

18:21.680 --> 18:23.636
You haven't gained anything
in a month, Gina.

18:24.240 --> 18:27.240
Top of the milk for you, and make sure
you help yourself to an extra potato.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.468
That being said, I'm not sure
how much longer you've got left.

18:30.800 --> 18:32.233
There's still nothing doing, Nurse.

18:32.720 --> 18:33.896
I thought if I came down here,

18:33.920 --> 18:36.593
it might stop me painting the bathroom,
or my husband.

18:37.040 --> 18:38.280
Oh, is he getting restless too?

18:38.760 --> 18:39.829
Not so you'd notice.

18:40.040 --> 18:42.280
It's like he doesn't even know
there's a baby on the way.

18:47.720 --> 18:50.075
Thank you, Sister.
I'm sorry to have kept you.

18:50.160 --> 18:52.037
Some blood results
came back from The London.

18:52.120 --> 18:54.395
- One or two will need attention.
- Thank you.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.070
Could you pop over
to the side room, Sister?

18:57.280 --> 19:00.238
This week's unmarried mothers are ready
to catch the bus to the station.

19:00.480 --> 19:02.152
You just need to sign those final forms.

19:02.240 --> 19:03.240
Of course.

19:09.880 --> 19:11.438
Good afternoon, may I help you?

19:11.640 --> 19:12.914
I had another dizzy do.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.840
Red-headed nurse said I could come here,
but I only want to talk to her.

19:15.960 --> 19:18.997
Of course. Take a seat,
and I'll fetch Nurse Mount.

19:21.440 --> 19:22.873
It was my husband made me come.

19:23.600 --> 19:26.361
I had a hard time having Jonah.
It took me ages to pick up afterwards.

19:26.560 --> 19:28.640
Well, these things
do all get rather harder with age.

19:29.280 --> 19:31.669
- Where was Jonah born?
- In a barge, like the others.

19:32.360 --> 19:34.510
I always liked the quiet,
and being on me own.

19:35.200 --> 19:36.200
On your own?

19:37.120 --> 19:38.473
But maybe not this time.

19:39.200 --> 19:40.872
We can look after you when you deliver,

19:41.280 --> 19:43.794
and keep an eye on your blood pressure,
which is rather low.

19:44.160 --> 19:46.754
The London blood tests
show that you are also anaemic,

19:47.320 --> 19:49.675
so our rather lovely doctor
can prescribe you iron pills.

19:49.800 --> 19:50.800
Would they cost much?

19:51.080 --> 19:52.399
Mmm, just the prescription fee.

19:53.040 --> 19:56.077
Only, my Joe had to turn down
a Birmingham cargo today

19:56.160 --> 19:57.229
'cause of me coming here.

19:59.520 --> 20:00.520
Where's Lou?

20:00.960 --> 20:03.190
Doing great paper handicrafts
with the other children,

20:03.360 --> 20:05.560
and being quite the bossy boots
from the look of things.

20:05.800 --> 20:07.400
She's like a second mum
to my three lads.

20:07.840 --> 20:09.273
I call her "my right hand".

20:10.080 --> 20:12.071
- Knock, knock.
- Come in, Doctor.

20:12.560 --> 20:15.279
I was just telling Mrs Blacker
what a sterling service we provide.

20:15.760 --> 20:18.832
No stone left unturned
in pursuit of a happy outcome,

20:19.640 --> 20:23.633
which means that we need to give you
a bit of extra care, Mrs Blacker.

20:23.840 --> 20:26.229
- The nurse said about the iron pills.
- Yes.

20:26.560 --> 20:30.075
And I'd also like to book you
into our maternity home for bed rest.

20:34.080 --> 20:35.911
I do appreciate that it will be a wrench

20:36.000 --> 20:38.560
for you to be away
from your children, Mrs Blacker.

20:39.280 --> 20:42.397
But you need to put your new baby
and yourself first, for a while.

20:42.480 --> 20:45.233
We do everything together, all of us.

20:45.680 --> 20:46.680
We're never apart.

20:47.080 --> 20:50.595
Your husband and children can visit
every evening between 5:00 and 7:00,

20:51.240 --> 20:52.593
longer at weekends.

20:53.600 --> 20:54.715
That sounds all right.

20:55.480 --> 20:58.074
And they'll have
so much to tell you every day.

20:58.360 --> 21:00.078
The school has room
for all four of them,

21:00.160 --> 21:02.151
Joney and Barney
will be in the same class,

21:02.480 --> 21:05.040
and Lou can meet up with them
every day at playtime.

21:06.120 --> 21:08.475
Do you wanna go to school,
or do you wanna stop with Dad?

21:08.760 --> 21:09.760
School.

21:13.120 --> 21:14.120
All right.

21:15.280 --> 21:19.398
Very wise. So, if I could just
get you to confirm that I've entered

21:19.480 --> 21:22.438
your name, address, and birth date
correctly on the booking form,

21:22.520 --> 21:24.715
we're all ship-shape in Bristol fashion.

21:25.480 --> 21:26.754
I haven't brought me glasses.

21:29.560 --> 21:32.632
Not to worry.
I'll fine-tune the paperwork.

21:37.280 --> 21:41.273
Sister Monica Joan, I really don't think
Dr Turner wants to be competing

21:41.360 --> 21:43.032
with The Black And White Minstrels.

21:44.440 --> 21:47.034
The room required cleansing
with Glad-Ax,

21:47.720 --> 21:51.713
for it'd have been unsettled
by the advent of strange medicine.

21:52.080 --> 21:53.640
What's happened to trouble you, Sister?

21:54.480 --> 21:57.153
The mark of it remains quite plain

21:59.040 --> 22:00.393
upon the wall.

22:03.800 --> 22:06.268
Put these back in the kitchen.
They're for after the talk.

22:25.360 --> 22:28.830
In the United States,
the pill was initially only approved

22:28.920 --> 22:31.036
as a treatment for menstrual disorders.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.116
But hundreds of thousands
of American women

22:34.280 --> 22:36.111
are now taking it as a contraceptive,

22:36.720 --> 22:40.793
and it has been declared
to be 100% effective

22:40.880 --> 22:42.199
in preventing pregnancy.

22:42.760 --> 22:45.877
One of the best things
about this method of contraception

22:45.960 --> 22:48.872
is that it's completely
within the control of the woman.

22:49.480 --> 22:51.516
Some men
aren't going to like that.

22:52.360 --> 22:54.555
Listen, I've spent
quite enough afternoons

22:54.640 --> 22:55.959
in family planning clinics.

22:56.880 --> 22:58.791
Rolling sheaths onto a wooden...

22:58.880 --> 23:00.440
Oh, excuse me, Sister, may I say penis?

23:01.640 --> 23:02.640
By all means.

23:03.440 --> 23:04.440
Wooden penis,

23:04.920 --> 23:07.434
trying to convince mothers
of five or six children

23:07.760 --> 23:10.069
that barrier methods are the way ahead.

23:10.800 --> 23:13.109
Time and again,
you get the same response.

23:13.520 --> 23:16.432
"My Eddie won't." "My Ted can't."

23:16.800 --> 23:20.315
"My Billy says it's like going
for a paddle with your socks on."

23:26.280 --> 23:28.999
There are so many things
about sobriety that surprised me.

23:30.320 --> 23:33.198
Everybody's journey here
seems to begin with such a bang.

23:34.240 --> 23:35.719
The torrents of tears,

23:36.320 --> 23:37.992
the phone calls in the dead of night,

23:39.200 --> 23:40.315
the wanting to die.

23:42.680 --> 23:44.318
My experience was no different.

23:46.040 --> 23:47.439
But what nobody tells you,

23:48.160 --> 23:50.151
or at least what nobody told me
in almost a year

23:50.240 --> 23:52.754
of dragging myself here on the 49 bus,

23:54.480 --> 23:58.837
is that life without a drink
can be so appallingly boring.

24:00.600 --> 24:01.794
The drag,

24:03.160 --> 24:04.229
the utter drag

24:05.520 --> 24:07.192
of Horlicks every night,

24:08.320 --> 24:10.834
the tedium of barley water
with your Sunday lunch.

24:11.800 --> 24:14.439
Oh, it used to be such fun
to mix a drink thinking.

24:14.960 --> 24:17.400
"What can I put in this Campari
to make it a brighter colour,"

24:17.840 --> 24:18.840
"give it more bite?"

24:19.720 --> 24:22.280
Oh, and I so love the smell
of maraschino cherries.

24:24.680 --> 24:26.318
I love the lipstick red of them.

24:28.760 --> 24:30.273
And the way other people smiled

24:30.360 --> 24:34.273
as I speared the cherry
on a cocktail stick.

24:35.840 --> 24:37.751
It was such a wonderfully
frivolous thing.

24:38.240 --> 24:41.516
It meant that I was with friends,
that I wasn't alone.

24:45.320 --> 24:47.788
I don't bother much
with maraschino cherries anymore.

24:49.400 --> 24:52.836
I don't even put them in my Horlicks,
or my barley water.

24:53.800 --> 24:54.869
They taste revolting.

24:57.640 --> 24:58.755
I don't need them.

25:00.240 --> 25:02.515
I know that fun
doesn't come in bottles, now.

25:03.920 --> 25:05.558
I know the value of sobriety.

25:07.960 --> 25:11.953
And I know what friendship really is,
what it means.

25:13.400 --> 25:15.595
I always did, I just couldn't see it.

25:17.320 --> 25:20.278
I owed the 49 bus rather a lot,
all things considered.

25:26.480 --> 25:27.480
And I owe you,

25:28.560 --> 25:30.710
all of you, even more.

25:32.680 --> 25:33.680
Thank you.

25:36.080 --> 25:37.832
Like any method of contraception,

25:38.400 --> 25:40.709
you have to use it religiously,
or it doesn't work.

25:41.120 --> 25:42.456
And there are some groups of women

25:42.480 --> 25:45.040
who'll find
taking daily medication difficult.

25:45.120 --> 25:47.554
Which could be a catastrophe
if they're single.

25:49.240 --> 25:53.756
I'm extremely concerned
that we do nothing to promote

25:54.480 --> 25:56.118
recreational intercourse.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.956
And I'm sure Mr Hereward
feels the same.

26:01.120 --> 26:03.998
Well, what are
the government guidelines?

26:04.920 --> 26:07.593
Mr Hereward,
shouldn't you be more concerned

26:07.680 --> 26:10.194
with church teachings
than government guidelines?

26:11.320 --> 26:13.470
Well, I do think
we have to be mindful of the Bible.

26:14.120 --> 26:15.951
When Paul wrote to the Corinthians,
he said,

26:16.040 --> 26:18.235
"There is too much immorality
among you."

26:18.920 --> 26:22.959
"Let each man keep to his own wife,
and each woman to her own husband."

26:23.560 --> 26:25.080
But how on earth can that be relevant?

26:25.640 --> 26:27.312
Well, contraception
wasn't invented then.

26:27.880 --> 26:30.394
The times change, but the value
of marriage remains constant.

26:30.880 --> 26:35.317
So, say there's a young woman,
she's 19 or 20,

26:35.840 --> 26:38.149
and she's in love with a boy,
who's in love with her,

26:39.320 --> 26:44.110
and she knows and he knows
that they can't keep fighting

26:44.200 --> 26:46.668
this desire that's drawing
them together.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.479
Would you have them risk everything,

26:50.280 --> 26:52.919
their reputation, their peace of mind,
because they simply

26:53.560 --> 26:54.675
can't help themselves?

26:55.600 --> 26:57.670
I'd be obliged
to counsel self-restraint.

27:01.000 --> 27:05.391
And with Mr Hereward's wise words,
it's time we drew this to a close.

27:07.240 --> 27:09.754
Nurse Gilbert,
I believe you're first on call.

27:10.960 --> 27:14.635
Tom, how could you sit there
and lecture people on self-restraint,

27:14.760 --> 27:16.936
in a room where your Brylcreem
has made a mark on the wall

27:16.960 --> 27:18.632
as big as an elephant's face?

27:19.520 --> 27:20.999
I wasn't lecturing.

27:21.720 --> 27:23.120
Sister Julienne put me on the spot.

27:23.640 --> 27:26.360
- Well, you hadn't said a word till then.
- Well, nobody asked me to.

27:26.560 --> 27:27.959
And I could hardly chip in.

27:28.360 --> 27:29.713
You were talking about medicine

27:29.800 --> 27:32.553
- and mens...
- Menstruation?

27:33.240 --> 27:35.435
Both subjects
about which I know nothing.

27:35.760 --> 27:36.909
Well, maybe you should learn

27:37.000 --> 27:38.776
if you're going to go around
family planning meetings

27:38.800 --> 27:41.314
like some sort of moral advisor.

27:43.160 --> 27:45.480
Barbara, are you saying
you believe in sex before marriage?

27:45.680 --> 27:46.680
No.

27:47.320 --> 27:49.993
I'm saying I believe it happens,

27:50.640 --> 27:51.959
and I know how it happens.

27:53.160 --> 27:56.994
I'm sorry. It's Gina Maitlin's first,
and she's gone into labour.

27:57.120 --> 27:58.758
She'll be fretting
until someone arrives.

28:03.240 --> 28:04.240
Can I have a kiss?

28:06.280 --> 28:07.280
Just the one.

28:11.800 --> 28:12.800
Tiger.

28:25.640 --> 28:29.474
Oh, Gina, you've had a long night.

28:30.000 --> 28:33.072
But this is normal,
especially with a first baby,

28:33.600 --> 28:35.318
and you are doing so well.

28:35.680 --> 28:41.232
Oh, no. It hurts. It hurts so much,
and that gas is useless.

28:42.040 --> 28:43.268
It's not useless.

28:44.080 --> 28:46.196
It's run out.

28:46.520 --> 28:47.520
Mr Maitlin.

28:48.360 --> 28:49.395
Mr Maitlin.

28:50.120 --> 28:51.678
Sorry, I fell asleep.

28:52.480 --> 28:54.152
And I'm sorry I had to wake you,

28:54.800 --> 28:56.480
but I need you
to make a phone call for me.

28:58.040 --> 28:59.519
You lot behave yourselves now.

29:02.120 --> 29:04.315
- And you.
- Last man to keep me in order, I reckon.

29:16.120 --> 29:18.759
I may not be on horseback,
but consider me the cavalry.

29:19.080 --> 29:21.992
Gina, this baby's well on its way,

29:22.400 --> 29:24.755
but we brought more gas
to get us through the home stretch.

29:25.280 --> 29:27.748
Shall I take over? You look done in.

29:33.160 --> 29:35.515
You yell your head off
if you fancy it, Gina.

29:36.080 --> 29:38.071
It's the last you'll be happy
without some help.

29:42.760 --> 29:43.875
Am I the only one in here?

29:44.600 --> 29:47.353
Yes, you're lucky.
We're unusually quiet at the moment.

29:48.400 --> 29:50.356
Ceiling's so high.

29:50.440 --> 29:52.635
Makes me feel dizzy,
even though I'm not.

29:54.640 --> 29:56.517
Your blood pressure's rather good today.

29:57.360 --> 29:58.839
Morning, Mrs Blacker.

29:59.400 --> 30:01.755
A doctor will be here
to check you over shortly,

30:01.920 --> 30:05.071
and I've come to ask if you want
a soft or a hard-boiled egg.

30:05.560 --> 30:07.391
I have bread in the mornings, usually.

30:08.000 --> 30:11.117
- Eggs are surprisingly rich in iron.
- What's this?

30:11.680 --> 30:13.910
Nightdress, dressing gown and slippers.

30:14.400 --> 30:15.816
I told you everything would be provided.

30:15.840 --> 30:17.796
No, I mean what's this?

30:18.360 --> 30:21.830
It says, "Property of
Kenilworth Row Maternity Home."

30:21.920 --> 30:23.040
We write that on everything.

30:26.760 --> 30:28.637
Baby's with us
as far as his shoulders, Gina.

30:29.440 --> 30:33.399
If you can give me one more
massive, brave push,

30:33.560 --> 30:34.720
you'll have him in your arms.

30:54.640 --> 30:55.640
Oh, lass.

30:55.960 --> 30:58.428
You put the graft in
and here is your reward.

30:59.480 --> 31:00.754
It's a little boy, Gina.

31:01.760 --> 31:03.716
You just wait till you see him.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.036
You got a little smasher there,
you really have.

31:18.800 --> 31:21.155
Your husband will be grinning
from ear to ear.

31:24.200 --> 31:25.800
I don't reckon Leslie wants any of this.

31:27.160 --> 31:28.160
The baby,

31:29.320 --> 31:30.320
or a wife.

31:31.040 --> 31:32.996
Gina, I'm sure that isn't true.

31:34.160 --> 31:36.833
We'd only been courting three months
and we had to get married.

31:38.200 --> 31:39.679
It's not what either of us planned.

31:41.080 --> 31:42.354
I came round to it.

31:43.560 --> 31:45.676
I couldn't help it
once I felt him kicking.

31:47.960 --> 31:49.757
But I don't think Leslie ever did.

31:56.560 --> 31:57.560
He's so soft.

32:00.600 --> 32:04.229
Leslie said we could call him Robert
if he was a boy,

32:04.960 --> 32:06.075
after his granddad.

32:08.440 --> 32:10.590
But I just don't think
he really wanted him,

32:12.040 --> 32:13.040
or me.

32:14.440 --> 32:16.040
Except for in the way he shouldn't have.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.719
It's far too late
to be crying about that now.

32:22.560 --> 32:23.560
Whoa!

32:24.440 --> 32:26.795
- Barley sugar?
- Oh, yes, please.

32:28.440 --> 32:31.352
It's a rotten business, isn't it,
having to get married?

32:31.880 --> 32:34.030
Well, there's plenty
make a decent fist of it,

32:34.680 --> 32:35.749
and plenty don't.

32:36.680 --> 32:39.000
Though, it's still better
than what my mother went through,

32:39.040 --> 32:40.598
when she had me out of wedlock.

32:42.040 --> 32:43.160
Oh, I don't mention it much.

32:45.480 --> 32:48.199
Suffice to say, it made its mark.

32:49.400 --> 32:52.153
During the war,
all morals were tossed to the winds.

32:52.640 --> 32:55.791
But even so, when the opportunity
of a weekend in Cleveleys

32:55.880 --> 32:58.075
with an air force sergeant
presented itself,

32:58.600 --> 33:01.797
- I nearly chickened out.
- Nearly chickened out?

33:02.680 --> 33:04.477
I did the appropriate research,

33:05.280 --> 33:09.512
and purchased a hygienic douche
through the small advertisements.

33:10.280 --> 33:12.794
It was called the Omega Spray.

33:13.960 --> 33:15.916
It involved a certain amount
of fiddle-faddle.

33:17.120 --> 33:18.633
But we managed well enough.

33:19.360 --> 33:22.113
I shall always have
very fond memories of Cleveleys.

33:23.280 --> 33:26.909
Phyllis, what happened to him,
the air force sergeant?

33:27.920 --> 33:30.354
Killed over Germany in 1941.

33:31.440 --> 33:32.440
Oh.

33:33.520 --> 33:36.193
It made me very glad
we'd seized the moment.

33:40.720 --> 33:41.869
It's almost a full moon.

33:43.560 --> 33:46.393
Sister Monica Joan is convinced
full moons are our busiest nights.

33:47.760 --> 33:49.512
I did a stint on psychiatric once.

33:50.280 --> 33:51.679
Used to say the same thing there.

33:55.960 --> 33:58.394
I wish the Blacker children
had got on better at school.

33:59.480 --> 34:00.480
When they visited Daisy,

34:00.560 --> 34:03.000
I heard them telling her
the other children had been horrible.

34:03.960 --> 34:05.234
Lou doesn't want to go again.

34:06.760 --> 34:09.274
- Do they smell?
- Lots of children smell.

34:10.199 --> 34:12.760
In any given vaccination queue,
you can tell who's been re-housed

34:12.800 --> 34:14.755
somewhere with a bathroom
and who hasn't.

34:16.760 --> 34:18.960
The Blacker children
are never going to have a bathroom.

34:20.000 --> 34:21.558
Their clothes are a problem too.

34:22.960 --> 34:26.110
Pats, next time
we both have the same night off,

34:27.639 --> 34:28.993
I wanna go to Gateways club.

34:30.320 --> 34:31.320
Why?

34:32.600 --> 34:34.080
'Cause there are women like us there?

34:34.679 --> 34:35.873
We've discussed this.

34:36.960 --> 34:39.713
I don't want to be with women like us,
I just want to be with you.

34:40.960 --> 34:43.871
We can hold hands there, dance there.

34:44.800 --> 34:46.710
Be in a crowd and be invisible.

34:48.800 --> 34:49.800
I'm sorry.

34:50.400 --> 34:52.277
Here you go, pass that down.
Well done.

34:57.600 --> 34:59.736
We'll rinse the lotion off your hair
and just trim the ends

34:59.760 --> 35:01.796
before you change
into some nice, smart clothes.

35:01.880 --> 35:04.120
I don't want us to be late.
They'll pick on us if we are.

35:04.400 --> 35:05.936
Ms Dawkins said
you could come in at 10:00,

35:05.960 --> 35:07.480
and go straight to Music and Movement.

35:08.160 --> 35:10.469
And no one will pick on you
wearing those

35:10.560 --> 35:12.391
lovely fresh knickers and vests.

35:12.600 --> 35:15.160
Here we are.
There's something for everyone,

35:15.240 --> 35:18.198
including ribbons for Lou's plaits.

35:24.120 --> 35:25.120
Perfect.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.434
The rest is clearly doing
everything we hoped.

35:28.520 --> 35:29.999
I feel like it might happen today.

35:30.280 --> 35:32.430
According to your dates,
you're not quite due.

35:32.520 --> 35:34.476
Let's see what Mother Nature
has in store.

35:35.520 --> 35:37.829
- Mummy!
- Look who I found coming up the stairs.

35:42.240 --> 35:43.240
What's happened?

35:43.960 --> 35:45.440
Well, Nurse got 'em spruced up a bit.

35:46.680 --> 35:47.800
We thought you'd be pleased.

35:48.360 --> 35:50.828
Pleased that they look
nothing like themselves?

35:52.880 --> 35:54.552
Pleased that they smell of disinfectant?

35:55.240 --> 35:56.832
It's just de-lousing lotion.

35:57.200 --> 35:58.952
Rather a lovely fresh smell,
I always think.

35:59.560 --> 36:01.039
My kids don't have lice.

36:01.280 --> 36:04.352
You get lice in schools, and they
never went there till yesterday.

36:04.440 --> 36:06.237
Sister Winifred insisted on it.

36:06.880 --> 36:10.395
She always says, "An ounce of prevention
is worth a pound of cure."

36:11.240 --> 36:12.880
And you dressed Lou up
like a little girl.

36:13.160 --> 36:14.513
Ribbons and ankle socks?

36:14.600 --> 36:16.520
They're not gonna last five minutes
on the barge.

36:16.880 --> 36:17.880
Daisy.

36:18.200 --> 36:19.349
Lou just wanted to fit in.

36:19.640 --> 36:22.040
- To be like everybody else.
- She's not like everybody else,

36:22.080 --> 36:23.399
she's a bargee,

36:23.480 --> 36:25.789
whether you like it or not.
We do things our way.

36:25.880 --> 36:28.030
Well, Nurse just wanted
what was best for them,

36:28.120 --> 36:29.720
just like I wanted
what was best for you.

36:30.040 --> 36:32.713
I'll tell you what's best for me,
my own bunk,

36:33.000 --> 36:35.514
my own food, and not to have
property of somebody else

36:35.600 --> 36:37.477
written all over me in black bloody pen.

36:37.680 --> 36:38.680
Mrs Blacker,

36:39.040 --> 36:40.776
you said yourself you didn't want
to have another baby

36:40.800 --> 36:42.597
- without help.
- Yeah, there's help,

36:42.960 --> 36:44.313
and there's interference.

36:45.280 --> 36:46.400
Fetch me my clothes, please.

36:47.240 --> 36:49.390
- Daisy...
- By which I mean my own clothes,

36:49.840 --> 36:52.274
the ones I came in wearing
and which are good enough for me.

36:52.640 --> 36:53.640
Going home.

36:54.320 --> 36:56.151
- Mrs Blacker...
- Fetch 'em.

37:20.920 --> 37:22.672
Wholesome high tide, I reckon.

37:23.600 --> 37:25.079
Straight out of <i>Whitaker's Almanack.</i>

37:25.440 --> 37:26.880
We ought to batten down the hatches.

37:27.320 --> 37:29.356
I'm sure there's
no need for us to be alarmed.

37:29.560 --> 37:30.560
Oh!

37:34.560 --> 37:36.440
It's blowing up
a right storm out there, Sister.

37:40.560 --> 37:41.560
Oh!

37:44.880 --> 37:46.472
Nonnatus House, midwife speaking.

37:47.120 --> 37:49.918
Hello, can you send a midwife
over to the maternity home?

37:50.480 --> 37:53.711
Mrs Mansoor's just arrived
and we already have a lady

37:53.800 --> 37:55.995
who's had to go straight through
to the delivery room.

37:56.760 --> 37:57.760
On my way, sweetie.

38:01.000 --> 38:03.040
There's just been a weather warning
on the wireless.

38:03.120 --> 38:04.758
Gale-force nine across London.

38:05.280 --> 38:08.795
That settles it, I'm not going anywhere
until I put on at least

38:08.880 --> 38:10.393
three layers of hair lacquer.

38:13.320 --> 38:14.753
Nonnatus House, midwife speaking.

38:21.480 --> 38:22.480
Dad!

38:23.720 --> 38:24.994
Stay down below, Lou,

38:26.080 --> 38:27.080
till this blows over.

38:27.560 --> 38:29.152
It's Mum, she isn't well.

38:29.720 --> 38:31.438
Nurse! Nurse!

38:32.160 --> 38:34.116
Oh, my goodness, are you in labour?

38:34.320 --> 38:36.311
Either that or I've weed
in my bleeding slippers.

38:41.680 --> 38:45.070
It's swaying. The whole block of flats
is actually swaying.

38:45.480 --> 38:46.480
Is it?

38:48.160 --> 38:52.073
- You all right?
- I don't know. I've got a headache,

38:53.600 --> 38:55.397
and a pain here under my ribs.

39:05.200 --> 39:06.394
Shall I clear off out,

39:06.960 --> 39:08.320
get the kids from under your feet?

39:09.120 --> 39:11.401
You can't go walking up and down
the towpath in this wind.

39:11.600 --> 39:13.640
I should be taking you back
to that little hospital.

39:13.680 --> 39:15.557
- Or even just fetch that nurse...
- No.

39:15.720 --> 39:17.836
We had words,
that nurse and me, bad words,

39:18.120 --> 39:19.838
- and I meant 'em.
- Daisy,

39:20.240 --> 39:21.355
tell me what to do.

39:21.920 --> 39:23.280
You'll have to go and get a sheet,

39:23.880 --> 39:25.108
and Lou can help me.

39:28.360 --> 39:29.873
Oh, hello, Mrs Mansoor.

39:30.480 --> 39:31.754
This is Mrs Wheatley.

39:33.120 --> 39:35.839
- Nurse Franklin...
- Dr Turner is in the delivery room.

39:35.920 --> 39:37.512
We have a deep transverse arrest.

39:38.360 --> 39:40.510
Well, maybe we should go straight
to Della and Nahima.

39:41.400 --> 39:44.710
One way or another, I think you two
will end up on first-name terms.

39:46.840 --> 39:47.840
Oh, Nahima.

39:58.960 --> 40:01.838
- I can see flashing lights.
- That's just the electrics.

40:02.440 --> 40:03.873
Keeps flickering with the storm.

40:04.440 --> 40:08.194
It's like spots or sparkles.

40:08.680 --> 40:10.511
I can see 'em even when I close me eyes.

40:26.880 --> 40:28.438
Let's see how things are lining up.

40:29.440 --> 40:31.874
With a bit of luck,
you'll be able to start pushing soon.

40:32.640 --> 40:34.995
Hang on, Nahima.

40:35.520 --> 40:37.590
I'll be across in two ticks, I promise.

40:46.320 --> 40:47.753
It's just the lights in the flat.

40:53.960 --> 40:55.359
I can't see properly.

40:58.480 --> 40:59.480
I'm gonna get help.

41:16.120 --> 41:18.190
I need you to come and see my mum.

41:19.280 --> 41:20.280
Come in.

41:24.560 --> 41:27.074
I've got one cable running
into the delivery room,

41:27.280 --> 41:29.191
there's a mother
who still needs stitches,

41:29.280 --> 41:31.430
and we need a working light in the ward.

41:32.080 --> 41:34.674
Doctor, Mrs Mansoor's baby's crowning.

41:35.600 --> 41:37.591
Some people have parents
who do ordinary jobs.

41:37.680 --> 41:39.079
Get cranking the handle.

41:46.640 --> 41:47.789
Sooner them than me.

41:57.960 --> 41:58.960
Midwife calling.

42:03.760 --> 42:07.833
This way, Nurse, and mind your head.
We've got the water on already.

42:11.680 --> 42:12.680
Thank you.

42:14.240 --> 42:16.629
We heard her kicking off yelling
and, well, we all know

42:16.720 --> 42:18.597
what that sort of racket
means, don't we?

42:20.200 --> 42:22.589
She's calmed down a bit
since she's had some company.

42:24.680 --> 42:27.035
- Hello, Nurse.
- Any objection to me popping by?

42:27.480 --> 42:29.040
I can just leave you with your friends.

42:29.080 --> 42:30.080
Bless ya,

42:30.800 --> 42:31.800
and bless them.

42:32.640 --> 42:34.039
Never met any of them before.

42:34.160 --> 42:35.840
Don't mean to say
we ain't friends, though.

42:36.280 --> 42:39.158
We know the life,
that means we know each other.

42:39.480 --> 42:40.480
Yes.

42:42.640 --> 42:44.995
Come on, then.
Let's clear out, make some room.

42:45.320 --> 42:47.914
We'll take the kids down
the <i>Golden Maid</i> with their father.

42:48.640 --> 42:51.438
And what about this one?
She looks old enough to come in handy.

42:52.640 --> 42:55.632
Take her with the other kids.
Me and Nurse Mount can manage.

42:56.160 --> 42:58.390
- Can't we?
- Absolutely.

42:59.040 --> 43:00.917
And I'll take my lead from you.

43:02.080 --> 43:05.470
Calm down, take a deep breath,
and tell me what you mean.

43:06.840 --> 43:08.717
She says she can see flashing lights.

43:09.400 --> 43:11.550
Go back to Gina and wait with her.

43:12.200 --> 43:15.715
I'm telephoning for an ambulance
and then I'll come straight to you.

43:17.040 --> 43:20.749
I require an ambulance, please.
Nelson Tower.

43:21.400 --> 43:23.709
<i>- Yes.</i>
- Anchorage Estate,

43:24.640 --> 43:25.914
flat number...

43:26.760 --> 43:27.760
Oh.

43:28.280 --> 43:29.280
Hello?

43:30.640 --> 43:32.710
Oh, hell's teeth.

43:37.120 --> 43:38.155
Good grief.

43:45.840 --> 43:46.840
Come on.

43:58.160 --> 44:00.913
And that's me excused from
physical jerks for the rest of the week.

44:01.160 --> 44:02.896
It's a good job you live
on the eighth floor, young lady,

44:02.920 --> 44:03.920
not the 18th.

44:07.760 --> 44:09.000
Let's have a look at you, love.

44:16.480 --> 44:18.311
Leslie tells me you've had a headache

44:18.960 --> 44:20.313
and some visual disturbance.

44:21.160 --> 44:24.152
- Any nausea or vomiting?
- I feel a bit sick.

44:29.720 --> 44:30.720
Right.

44:31.480 --> 44:33.755
I called an ambulance before I left,

44:33.840 --> 44:36.149
and I'm of the view
we should make use of it.

44:37.080 --> 44:40.197
All things considered, I think you'll be
better off in the hospital.

44:40.320 --> 44:41.435
What about Robert?

44:42.600 --> 44:43.874
Robert can come, too.

44:46.560 --> 44:48.755
Leslie, while you've been with Gina,

44:49.400 --> 44:51.516
has she suffered
from any twitching or shaking

44:51.600 --> 44:53.830
anything that you might describe
as a fit?

44:54.400 --> 44:55.958
No... I don't know.

44:58.040 --> 44:59.234
How ill is she, Nurse?

45:00.240 --> 45:03.550
There's a condition called preeclampsia
which can affect pregnant women.

45:03.800 --> 45:06.439
Once in a blue moon,
it kicks in after a baby's been born.

45:08.320 --> 45:09.320
Will she die?

45:10.000 --> 45:11.991
There's plenty we can do to help her.

45:13.120 --> 45:14.696
But the ambulance won't have
the complete address,

45:14.720 --> 45:18.429
I need you to go downstairs,
wait outside, and flag it down.

45:18.880 --> 45:19.880
I'm not gonna leave her.

45:20.320 --> 45:22.993
- Leslie, we can't waste any time.
- I'm not gonna leave my wife.

45:23.400 --> 45:24.753
I don't want him to go.

45:25.520 --> 45:28.512
I don't want him to go.
Don't leave me, Leslie.

45:33.400 --> 45:36.198
Right, Gina you need a warm coat
and something on your feet.

45:44.360 --> 45:47.830
That's the ticket, kids.
One foot in front of the other.

45:49.120 --> 45:50.553
Here you go.

45:52.640 --> 45:53.675
Almost there, sweetheart.

46:01.640 --> 46:02.800
You still in one piece, kids?

46:06.320 --> 46:07.320
She's being sick.

46:10.880 --> 46:11.880
That's it.

46:13.040 --> 46:14.040
That's wonderful, Daisy.

46:24.720 --> 46:26.119
Come on, you lovebirds.

46:33.920 --> 46:34.920
Save your courting

46:36.400 --> 46:38.311
till we've got you
safely in that ambulance.

46:45.840 --> 46:46.909
Baby's turning, Daisy.

46:47.720 --> 46:48.755
It knows just what to do.

46:49.520 --> 46:50.520
Like you do.

46:56.320 --> 46:57.958
That's perfect.

47:00.880 --> 47:02.518
Can I hold it? Can I?

47:03.880 --> 47:04.880
Just hold on one moment.

47:05.960 --> 47:08.679
Sorry, little one. There we go.

47:10.320 --> 47:11.560
Go on, you can pick her up now.

47:12.080 --> 47:13.957
- Her?
- It's a little girl.

47:29.040 --> 47:30.040
Oh, don't cut it yet.

47:32.240 --> 47:33.240
In a minute, then.

47:38.440 --> 47:41.352
There's worse things than being
completely part of someone,

47:43.040 --> 47:44.553
being part of something bigger,

47:46.760 --> 47:48.193
even just for a little while.

47:57.040 --> 47:58.951
But we know where we belong, don't we?

48:12.800 --> 48:14.040
- Are you coming with us?
- Yes.

48:14.480 --> 48:16.994
I shall be following behind
just to be on the safe side,

48:17.120 --> 48:19.270
but you don't need me. You've got him.

48:19.960 --> 48:20.995
You really have.

48:21.760 --> 48:24.069
And he knows how to take care
of his family.

48:24.360 --> 48:25.360
Yes, I do,

48:26.120 --> 48:27.440
and I'm not gonna leave her side.

48:28.040 --> 48:31.112
That's what we like to hear, isn't it?
Good lad.

48:38.320 --> 48:40.311
Have you seen the state
of the street outside?

48:41.120 --> 48:42.314
Is it still impassable?

48:42.800 --> 48:46.076
Suffice to say, if it hadn't have been
for two extremely helpful firemen,

48:46.160 --> 48:47.229
I wouldn't be here at all.

48:48.360 --> 48:50.430
What's the situation
with the maternity home?

48:50.840 --> 48:53.115
No telephone and no electricity.

48:54.040 --> 48:55.800
Of the three mothers
who delivered overnight,

48:55.840 --> 48:57.831
Mrs Jones had forceps
and was transferred

48:57.920 --> 48:59.478
to St Cuthbert's this morning.

49:00.160 --> 49:03.391
Mrs Wheatley and Mrs Mansoor
and their babies were discharged

49:03.480 --> 49:05.118
because their homes still have power.

49:05.360 --> 49:07.271
We'll add them to the morning's list.

49:07.480 --> 49:10.392
Meanwhile, we must visit
all our due and overdue mothers

49:10.480 --> 49:11.629
if there are any left,

49:12.080 --> 49:14.056
and make them aware
that we are deprived of telephony

49:14.080 --> 49:15.593
until further notice.

49:16.120 --> 49:17.872
I saw your note about Gina Maitlin.

49:18.520 --> 49:21.159
Post-natal preeclampsia is so very rare.

49:21.600 --> 49:24.512
When I left for London,
she was poorly, but stable,

49:25.120 --> 49:27.475
and her husband
was camped outside her room.

49:28.360 --> 49:31.033
So, all in all,
there's every reason for optimism.

49:32.160 --> 49:34.469
- Mind your noggin on that.
- Thank you, officer.

49:38.960 --> 49:40.279
What's happened, Fred?

49:40.920 --> 49:44.037
The railway signal blew down
and took half the old wall with it.

49:44.160 --> 49:45.991
It's come down like a stack of dominoes.

49:46.280 --> 49:47.280
Was anyone hurt?

49:47.560 --> 49:49.710
We don't think
there's anyone underneath it.

49:50.240 --> 49:53.277
Let's see if we can get you past
and to your patients. Bob?

49:53.800 --> 49:55.756
All right, all right,
it's a pile of rubble

49:55.840 --> 49:57.831
not the pyramids of Egypt.

49:58.360 --> 50:00.715
Get a shovel and start clearing it.

50:01.000 --> 50:03.150
Anyone would think
there'd never been a wall.

50:03.240 --> 50:04.240
Sister!

50:05.920 --> 50:07.399
Morning, Sister Julienne.

50:08.320 --> 50:09.435
Sister Mary Cynthia.

50:09.960 --> 50:12.838
Meanwhile, I see Fred's been pillaging
the dressing-up box.

50:13.640 --> 50:16.154
Where's the real ARP warden
when you need one?

50:16.440 --> 50:18.715
- Oh, here, mind your step there.
- No, thank you,

50:18.800 --> 50:20.028
I can see where I'm going.

50:20.680 --> 50:23.399
Sister Evangelina,
this really is a most

50:23.840 --> 50:26.559
- extraordinary surprise.
- Well, it wouldn't have been

50:26.640 --> 50:28.915
if anyone had answered the telephone
this morning.

50:29.360 --> 50:31.749
Oh, the line was blown down in the gale.

50:32.320 --> 50:33.600
And what are you doing about it?

50:34.240 --> 50:36.480
Well, I was just on my way to call in
at the post office.

50:37.360 --> 50:39.590
Whatever happened to never surrender?

50:39.920 --> 50:42.309
Oh, excuse me, excuse me.

50:43.560 --> 50:46.711
Do you suppose she's back for good
or just for a visit?

50:47.440 --> 50:50.591
We can only hope
she intends to enlighten us.

50:57.000 --> 50:58.877
That's that little problem ironed out.

50:59.800 --> 51:01.756
Their line is still up and running.

51:02.360 --> 51:04.920
The connection was protected
by the railway bridge.

51:05.120 --> 51:07.953
So, I've requisitioned their phone
for the duration.

51:09.960 --> 51:13.077
Fred, when you've finished
saving the world,

51:13.560 --> 51:16.597
- I shall be requiring my bicycle.
- Yes, Sister.

51:17.920 --> 51:20.150
I shall be easing myself back in.

51:20.280 --> 51:22.555
No midwifery duties for a while.

51:23.520 --> 51:26.080
I'll warm myself up on district work

51:26.600 --> 51:28.989
before you let me loose
on precious cargo.

51:30.680 --> 51:32.920
It's so very, very good to have you
back with us, Sister.

51:33.840 --> 51:37.389
Well, with one thing and another,
it was about time.

51:37.760 --> 51:40.957
There's only so much peace and quiet
the soul can take.

51:41.040 --> 51:43.508
In the end, it's like giving a plant
too much water.

51:45.640 --> 51:49.758
An autoclave can only sterilise things
if they're properly cleaned beforehand.

51:49.920 --> 51:52.115
It is a machine, not a magician.

51:54.360 --> 51:58.558
Nevertheless, we still have power
which is a blessing from above

51:58.640 --> 51:59.914
if there ever was one.

52:03.560 --> 52:04.560
"And behold."

52:05.480 --> 52:06.480
"I am with thee,"

52:07.520 --> 52:10.830
"and will keep thee in all places
whither thou goest."

52:11.720 --> 52:14.393
"I will bring thee again into this land."

52:15.040 --> 52:18.635
"For I will not leave."

52:21.640 --> 52:23.676
Book of Genesis
instead of Keats, indeed.

52:24.320 --> 52:26.040
That gale must've blown
some sense into you.

52:28.560 --> 52:30.437
Now, go and see
if there's any cake in the tin.

52:32.720 --> 52:36.269
<i>For some,
the high winds altered very little.</i>

52:36.720 --> 52:40.349
<i>The Blackers,
with their healthy newborn, left London</i>

52:40.560 --> 52:43.313
<i>and headed north,
along straight waterways</i>

52:43.400 --> 52:45.789
<i>that hadn't changed in decades.</i>

52:45.960 --> 52:46.960
- Bye!
- Aah.

52:47.360 --> 52:49.794
<i>Sister Winifred
arranged for the children's lessons</i>

52:49.880 --> 52:52.678
<i>to be sent to them, and marked by post.</i>

52:53.080 --> 52:54.080
<i>It was something.</i>

52:56.080 --> 53:01.791
<i>Meanwhile, Leslie Maitlin
grew in strength, courage, and love</i>

53:01.880 --> 53:03.199
<i>for his wife and child.</i>

53:03.520 --> 53:05.750
<i>But, not every happiness is chosen.</i>

53:06.120 --> 53:09.351
<i>Some, like the harvest,
simply have to be accepted.</i>

53:09.560 --> 53:12.028
Sister, I was looking for you.

53:12.280 --> 53:14.589
Another donation.
Five pounds of wormy apples,

53:14.680 --> 53:17.035
and I am sorry to say, a marrow.

53:17.440 --> 53:20.955
- I was hoping to ask you something.
- Mmm-hmm?

53:21.640 --> 53:24.438
If it's about this contraceptive pill,
all I've got to say

53:24.520 --> 53:26.112
is it's typical of Dr Turner.

53:26.320 --> 53:29.710
One sniff of a novelty medication,
he's off like a moggy with cat mint.

53:30.480 --> 53:33.677
I spent a great deal
of time and prayer about it,

53:34.920 --> 53:36.831
and just now,
the thing that worries me is you.

53:39.280 --> 53:41.157
Why? I've never felt better.

53:42.120 --> 53:44.200
I wish I could believe that
but it's not true, is it?

53:46.720 --> 53:47.914
I take it you mean this.

53:48.880 --> 53:49.880
Yes.

53:58.720 --> 53:59.835
I had a stroke.

54:02.400 --> 54:05.073
Two months after I left for the retreat.

54:06.520 --> 54:07.839
Why didn't you let us know?

54:08.600 --> 54:10.256
We could've prayed for you,
at the very least.

54:10.280 --> 54:11.280
I know.

54:11.680 --> 54:14.148
But at the time,
this was between me and Him.

54:15.880 --> 54:18.917
I was much worse than this,
I couldn't move my arm at all.

54:19.000 --> 54:21.798
You wouldn't have wanted to see me
slurping my tea.

54:21.880 --> 54:26.032
- Was your mouth affected too?
- Yeah, mouth, speech, the full works.

54:26.760 --> 54:29.558
I got all that back within six weeks.

54:30.240 --> 54:33.232
Even though most of the time
I had nobody to practise with.

54:34.160 --> 54:35.673
But I knew what He meant by it.

54:36.800 --> 54:40.190
I'd gone to the Silent Order
to learn to keep my peace,

54:40.920 --> 54:42.239
and He showed me.

54:43.680 --> 54:48.151
Prayers aren't always answered
the way one would hope but...

54:48.280 --> 54:50.953
They are generally answered.

54:52.960 --> 54:56.191
And the answer He gave me was this.

54:57.560 --> 55:01.633
When things change,
we have to find a different way.

55:02.760 --> 55:07.436
Now, whenever I do up a button
or a shoelace,

55:07.840 --> 55:10.354
I'm reminded
of the need to keep learning.

55:11.800 --> 55:14.360
A reminder we all need
from time to time.

55:15.200 --> 55:16.519
Nothing stays the same.

55:17.640 --> 55:19.756
We don't stay the same, ourselves.

55:21.200 --> 55:24.954
And all the time, the world
keeps on spinning faster.

56:02.880 --> 56:03.949
<i>Sometimes,</i>

56:04.840 --> 56:07.877
<i>there's a brightness
and a richness in the moment.</i>

56:08.880 --> 56:12.475
<i>Ripeness that simply says, "Taste this!"</i>

56:13.320 --> 56:18.519
<i>And calls us to partake without fear
or any thought of punishment.</i>

56:19.320 --> 56:23.154
<i>It is the fruit of our experience,
and in its heart,</i>

56:23.600 --> 56:26.319
<i>it bears the seed of all our hopes.</i>

56:44.600 --> 56:48.275
<i>Take the joy. Take all it gives.</i>

56:49.840 --> 56:50.989
<i>Life is sweet,</i>

56:52.840 --> 56:54.319
<i>and it is ours.</i>

56:55.600 --> 57:01.311
<i>As is our right to love
and relish every moment.</i>

57:04.120 --> 57:06.640
They let her off the boat first
because she's in the family way.

57:07.560 --> 57:08.760
We want to organise a wedding.

57:08.920 --> 57:11.798
<i>SISTER JULIENNE. I'd never had
any dreams of a wedding day.</i>

57:12.040 --> 57:13.951
I had, once upon a time.

57:14.320 --> 57:16.993
There must have been more
than just one or two cases.

57:17.160 --> 57:18.798
I don't know how to put it right.

57:19.000 --> 57:20.040
I just think she's lonely.

57:21.240 --> 57:22.240
Or heartbroken.

57:22.720 --> 57:24.597
When I see Tom
and Barbara together now,

57:24.680 --> 57:26.113
I don't see what I might've had,

57:26.200 --> 57:27.349
I see what they have.

57:27.760 --> 57:31.878
Babies are a two-handed job.
I do not handle newborns anymore.
