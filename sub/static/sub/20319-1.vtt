important anymore.</i>

00:44.055 --> 00:45.022
You there sir,
what's your name?

00:45.089 --> 00:46.189
Okay, who else?

00:46.257 --> 00:47.190
I'll take that.

01:20.256 --> 01:21.456
Good game.

01:21.524 --> 01:22.657
Thank you.

01:22.724 --> 01:24.225
[applause]

01:24.293 --> 01:26.627
I don't think he can win
one more game; I don't

01:26.695 --> 01:28.095
think he can win one more game.

01:28.163 --> 01:31.898
There it is; he did it;
that's four for four.

01:31.966 --> 01:33.434
All right let's wrap this up.

01:33.501 --> 01:35.502
Who has money on this; thank
you, thank you very much.

01:35.570 --> 01:37.204
Can you teach me how
to play like that?

01:37.272 --> 01:39.573
No, but I can teach
you how to play.

01:39.640 --> 01:40.907
Deal, next Wednesday.

01:40.975 --> 01:42.543
Deal, same time.

01:42.610 --> 01:44.077
All right.

01:44.144 --> 01:45.678
Thank you very much ladies
and gentlemen; be good,

01:45.745 --> 01:46.979
stay in school.

01:47.047 --> 01:49.982
Hold on man; that was
intense man, huh.

01:50.050 --> 01:51.584
It was a little crazy right.

01:51.651 --> 01:52.918
What are you going
to do with your hit?

01:52.986 --> 01:53.986
Mind putting that
in that for me? Thank you.

01:54.054 --> 01:55.121
I'm going to head out of here.

01:55.189 --> 01:56.155
Are you serious?

01:56.223 --> 01:57.223
Yeah.

01:57.291 --> 02:00.292
You want to make
me feel bad now?

02:01.327 --> 02:04.362
Great, good stuff. I love
donating. I love it, it's fun.

02:04.430 --> 02:05.830
All right. Thank you.

02:12.105 --> 02:14.106
We were at $250 each.

02:14.173 --> 02:16.074
The point of this whole
venture is to use your

02:16.141 --> 02:18.375
ability to make a fortune.

02:18.443 --> 02:19.843
You're not thinking
long-term.

02:19.911 --> 02:23.180
You could be a legend;
a con man for the ages.

02:23.248 --> 02:24.648
Not my style.

02:24.716 --> 02:27.418
So what; you're like a
telepathic Robin Hood?

02:27.486 --> 02:28.986
Stealing from the unjustly
rich, giving to the

02:29.053 --> 02:30.754
unfairly poor?

02:30.822 --> 02:33.323
So I take a wee fall into
the unfairly poor category.

02:33.390 --> 02:34.690
Is that right Little John?

Rule number one; what's
rule number one?

03:03.319 --> 03:04.852
Don't run.

03:04.919 --> 03:06.420
Exactly, we run, we trip,
we fall, we might get hurt.

03:06.488 --> 03:07.721
We get hurt what good are we.

03:07.789 --> 03:08.889
We're no good.

Now ladies and gentlemen
can I have you all clear

03:11.693 --> 03:12.926
out of the way please and
give us a little space?

03:12.994 --> 03:13.761
I pulled her out from the
lake; I'm not sure how

03:13.828 --> 03:14.862
long she's been there.

03:14.929 --> 03:16.096
Okay thank you.

03:16.165 --> 03:17.298
Can you come over her please.

03:17.366 --> 03:18.832
Ma'am can you hear me? Ma'am?

03:18.900 --> 03:20.333
A little space, there
you go, come on over. It's okay.

03:21.269 --> 03:23.570
I got a breath guys; go get
the blankets and stretcher.

03:51.106 --> 03:52.607
So before long you
know Toby and I managed

03:52.674 --> 03:55.075
to grab her before she
could dive back in and

03:55.142 --> 03:57.410
the kicker is that she's
amnesic so you understand

03:57.478 --> 03:59.278
if we don't chase after
her, then you know what

03:59.346 --> 04:00.480
can happen in that situation.

04:00.547 --> 04:01.982
Mr. Bay you broke rule #1.

04:02.049 --> 04:03.516
Well you know under the
circumstances

04:03.584 --> 04:04.918
as I was telling...

04:04.986 --> 04:08.121
You ran after this woman
and you do not run!

04:09.189 --> 04:11.090
Excuse me.

04:11.157 --> 04:13.792
Oh the lovely Dr. F.

04:13.860 --> 04:15.728
Pick me, please.

04:15.795 --> 04:17.997
Can I go Mr. Ryder.

04:18.064 --> 04:21.298
I'll uh, I'll finish this
up later, thank you.

04:21.367 --> 04:22.935
Thank you.

04:23.003 --> 04:25.037
Not a problem.

04:25.105 --> 04:28.306

04:29.375 --> 04:30.942
Oh my god.

04:31.010 --> 04:32.444
So what's going on Liv?

04:32.512 --> 04:34.246
It's about that amnesia
victim you brought in.

04:34.313 --> 04:36.314
I was thinking we could
take a look inside...help

04:36.382 --> 04:37.715
her dig some stuff up.

04:37.783 --> 04:40.718
Yeah, but Liv, you know
she's got amnesia.

04:40.786 --> 04:43.187
Yes but the full memories
are still there somewhere

04:43.255 --> 04:45.322
and I'm thinking if you
feed a detail or two back

04:45.390 --> 04:46.924
to her it might job something.

04:46.992 --> 04:48.225
It's a lot of work.

04:48.293 --> 04:50.895
Aren't you the
least bit curious? Come on.

04:50.963 --> 04:52.929
Look Liv, I don't see how
I can read thoughts she

04:52.997 --> 04:53.964
doesn't have.

04:54.032 --> 04:55.298
Sir, I can explain.

04:55.366 --> 04:56.733
The woman was clearly
in distress and...

04:56.801 --> 04:58.101
Sit down.

04:58.169 --> 05:00.103
Okay.

05:00.171 --> 05:01.437
That's not what I want
to talk to you about;

05:01.505 --> 05:02.605
at least not right now.

05:02.674 --> 05:04.007
Oh.

05:04.075 --> 05:07.510
Okay, what did you want
to talk to me about?

05:07.578 --> 05:09.478
You went out on a call
a couple of months ago,

05:09.546 --> 05:12.181
campus pub, lady had
irregular heartbeats...

05:12.248 --> 05:16.819
Yeah sure, I remember. Is
there something wrong?

05:16.887 --> 05:18.688
That depends on
your point of view.

05:18.755 --> 05:22.324
Personally I'm a
little shocked.

05:22.392 --> 05:25.860
Seems that you are to
receive a commendation for

05:25.928 --> 05:27.762
your actions in the field.

05:27.830 --> 05:29.097
A commendation?

05:29.165 --> 05:30.398
Yes.

05:32.401 --> 05:35.403
Well sir I'm, I'm speechless.

05:35.470 --> 05:39.574
I'm speechless too Mr.
Bay, but don't stay that way.

05:39.641 --> 05:41.008
Ceremony's a week from
Sunday and you're gonna

05:41.076 --> 05:42.676
need a speech.

05:44.746 --> 05:47.848
Huh, okay.

05:47.916 --> 05:49.216
All right, thank you. Great.

but they'll do for now.

06:09.269 --> 06:10.436
Thank you.

06:10.503 --> 06:11.604
And let's get you
settled in over here.

06:11.671 --> 06:12.604
Here let me help you with that.

06:12.671 --> 06:14.106
Oh thanks.

06:14.173 --> 06:15.107
And I thought you should
meet one of the paramedics

06:15.174 --> 06:17.142
that saved your life.

06:17.210 --> 06:18.409
Hey.

06:18.477 --> 06:19.410
Hey.

06:19.478 --> 06:20.746
So it's Ann is it?

06:20.813 --> 06:23.314
Oh, that's what she calls me.

06:23.382 --> 06:26.885
After Anastasia, the lost
daughter of the Romanov's.

06:26.953 --> 06:28.252
Of course, yes.

06:28.319 --> 06:30.087
So any breakthroughs?

06:30.155 --> 06:31.188
Oh no.

06:31.256 --> 06:33.891
I've been trying.

06:33.959 --> 06:36.861
Manicured nails,
likely not a maid.

06:36.928 --> 06:38.996
And you were wearing a
power suit, a kind of

06:39.064 --> 06:40.430
businesswoman I bet.

06:40.498 --> 06:42.199
I doubt you are married.

06:42.267 --> 06:45.701
Cause there's no tan line
on your ring finger.

06:45.770 --> 06:49.005
Do you remember when
Toby was helping you?

06:49.073 --> 06:50.974
I remember him trying.

06:51.041 --> 06:52.742
Yeah where were you
running anyway; where were

06:52.810 --> 06:55.544
you going to go?

06:55.612 --> 06:58.114
I don't know.

06:59.316 --> 07:03.385
Doesn't make any
sense, any of it.

07:03.452 --> 07:08.290
You were upset; something
had disturbed you.

07:08.357 --> 07:12.261
[sound effects]

07:16.631 --> 07:18.632
[sound effects]

07:24.406 --> 07:26.540
When we found you on
the beach you mumbled

07:26.608 --> 07:29.243
something about
a man and a boat.

07:29.311 --> 07:32.445
Maybe...

07:32.513 --> 07:34.480
oh no...

07:34.548 --> 07:36.283
...it's like there's
something there

07:36.350 --> 07:40.420
but it's just out of reach.

07:40.487 --> 07:42.355
It's so frustrating.

07:42.423 --> 07:46.059
Well maybe we
better let Ann rest.

07:55.836 --> 07:57.569
That was a strange read.

07:57.637 --> 07:59.071
Everything was murky,

07:59.139 --> 08:01.807
there was a pulse of light,
she's so [inaudible].

08:01.875 --> 08:05.109
Thank you... but there was
something there right?

08:05.177 --> 08:08.213
Yes there was; traces of
it anyway...whatever it

08:08.280 --> 08:10.414
was it just felt wrong.

08:10.482 --> 08:12.616
So now you do want
to know what's up.

08:12.684 --> 08:14.819
Yeah, I do; I'm a
little bit curious.

08:14.887 --> 08:17.255
Dr. Fawcett?

08:17.323 --> 08:20.991
Shane Lawson; you called
for a neuro consult?

08:21.059 --> 08:22.259
Toby Logan.

08:22.327 --> 08:26.930
A consult, yeah I did
do that, didn't I.

08:26.998 --> 08:29.166
Right, right I'm sorry,
she's right over...

08:29.234 --> 08:30.500
she's right over here.

08:30.568 --> 08:31.935
She was found this
morning unconscious.

08:32.003 --> 08:33.602
Looks like someone's in love.

08:33.671 --> 08:34.604
Lust.

08:34.672 --> 08:36.739
It's lust.

08:36.806 --> 08:38.374
Are you okay with that?

08:38.441 --> 08:41.376
Yeah I'm fine with that; Liv
and I broke up forever ago.

08:41.443 --> 08:43.645
Okay, just checking.

08:43.712 --> 08:44.680
How are you; are you good?

08:44.748 --> 08:48.817
Still divorced.

08:48.886 --> 08:50.619
S'cool.

08:52.889 --> 08:54.990
Okay haemostatic gauze...

08:57.393 --> 08:59.961
Talk to that amnesic?

09:00.029 --> 09:03.899
Uh, yeah, her memory's gone,
she doesn't know who she is.

09:03.966 --> 09:05.767
Wound closure kit...

09:05.834 --> 09:11.238
It's like she sees bits and
pieces; this massive void.

09:11.306 --> 09:13.607
Sounds like me the Monday
after Lalapalooza.

09:13.674 --> 09:14.808
Oral rehydration salts....

09:14.876 --> 09:17.945
There we go.

09:18.013 --> 09:19.613
Tell me you're not
getting involved.

09:19.680 --> 09:21.581
I am not getting involved.

09:21.649 --> 09:23.650
I mean you can't help but
feel for her but I'm not

09:23.718 --> 09:25.184
getting involved.

09:25.252 --> 09:27.153
Who is it that if you go
down this road again

09:27.221 --> 09:28.187
I should stop them?

09:28.255 --> 09:29.655
What road?

09:29.723 --> 09:30.756
The "I sense someone is in
danger, let me try to help

09:30.824 --> 09:33.026
and now I'm in
world of hurt" road.

09:33.093 --> 09:34.493
It's not that kind of thing.

09:34.561 --> 09:35.861
Toby I know you've been
through a lot, feeling

09:35.930 --> 09:37.330
guilty about losing
Charlie and the

you're doing, protecting me.

You don't have to
save everybody Toby.

10:07.459 --> 10:08.826
It doesn't make any sense.

10:08.893 --> 10:11.295
Well I thought that if
you could push a little

10:11.363 --> 10:14.164
harder, to jog her memories.

10:14.231 --> 10:15.598

attacked, I mean they're

So what's the word on Ann?

10:35.551 --> 10:41.023
No hematoma, no sign of brain
swelling, ran EEG, C scan, MRI.

10:48.630 --> 10:49.998
Oh it's good, good.

10:50.065 --> 10:51.866
It just means that there's
no damage to the brain

10:51.933 --> 10:54.935
itself, which means here
memory loss is temporary.

10:55.004 --> 10:57.605
That is good. So what's
the treatment.

Now she's in the paper.

I told you this was going

12:11.475 --> 12:13.509
started asking too
many questions.

12:13.577 --> 12:15.344
What do you want me to
say; you were right?

12:15.412 --> 12:18.914
I'm going to find

No.

Oh, right you were off then.

13:03.064 --> 13:05.766
Okay well Ryder he paired
me up with this hot shot,

13:05.834 --> 13:07.167
the rookie, Watanabi.

Oh Watanabi he's good man.

earned it, you know, but

Watanabi did the intubation.

13:17.978 --> 13:19.111
He's not qualified.

13:19.179 --> 13:20.713
No he's not qualified.

So on the call sheet we
wrote that I did it.

13:27.354 --> 13:29.188
All right so maybe if he
hadn't acted so quickly

13:29.256 --> 13:30.423
maybe the outcome would
have been different;

13:30.490 --> 13:32.191
maybe you guys did
the right thing.

21:45.259 --> 21:48.194
Do you recognize this
girl here on the bike?

21:48.261 --> 21:49.294
No problem.

21:49.362 --> 21:51.063
[hearing spell]

21:51.131 --> 21:53.866
<i>You people had my husband
killed; leave me alone okay.</i>

21:53.934 --> 21:56.268
Oh my god!

21:56.336 --> 21:58.637
Sgt. McCluskey, IIB.

21:58.705 --> 21:59.972
And Kim Kendal I'm going to have
to ask you to come with me.

22:00.040 --> 22:01.207
I'm just...

22:01.274 --> 22:02.474
Sorry who are you?

22:02.542 --> 22:03.541
You're wanted for
questioning in connection

22:03.609 --> 22:05.076
with the death
of Steve Murchin.

22:05.144 --> 22:06.577
What's going on here?

22:06.645 --> 22:07.846
Look there's someone on
that ferry over there that

22:07.913 --> 22:09.114
we should go speak to.

22:09.181 --> 22:10.314
Okay you know what;
have it your way.

22:10.382 --> 22:11.582
Bring them all in.

22:11.650 --> 22:14.119
No, for what? Come on,
are you serious?

22:14.186 --> 22:15.686
I'm going all right.

22:16.588 --> 22:19.589
Apparently her memory is
coming back in bits and pieces.

22:19.657 --> 22:21.859
Well that's not going to
help you build a case is it?

22:21.926 --> 22:23.660
So you're saying we
don't go to the crown

22:23.728 --> 22:25.162
prosecutor?

22:25.230 --> 22:26.730
Not until you can prove
that either she and-or

22:26.798 --> 22:29.633
Northern Superior Mining were
involved in Murchin's death.

22:29.700 --> 22:32.636
Are you speaking as in-house
counsel or as her friend.

22:32.703 --> 22:35.371
Both.

22:35.438 --> 22:37.140
What's up with
those two out there?

22:37.207 --> 22:40.810
Paramedics; Dev checked
them out. They're legit.

22:42.312 --> 22:45.815
You two are free to go.

22:45.883 --> 22:47.183
I'm worried about Ann.

22:47.251 --> 22:50.452
Miss Kendal is still
under investigation.

22:52.155 --> 22:53.789
Stay here.

22:54.691 --> 22:57.993
Sgt. McCluskey do you mind if
I speak to you for a moment?

22:58.060 --> 23:01.897
Sure, one minute.

23:02.999 --> 23:08.969
Um...On the island
Miss Kendal she was

23:09.037 --> 23:10.838
reacting to things.

23:10.906 --> 23:13.808
At one point she freaked out.

23:15.076 --> 23:19.980
You see she...

23:20.048 --> 23:21.816
...sorry.

23:21.883 --> 23:24.518
There was a woman on the
island and I think that

23:24.585 --> 23:29.356
this woman knows something
or she's involved.

23:29.424 --> 23:30.757
<i>[hearing spell] What?</i>

23:30.825 --> 23:33.860
<i>Does this guy think
she's innocent?</i>

23:33.928 --> 23:36.797
So IIB huh?

23:36.864 --> 23:43.969
What's that like international
imagination buddies?

23:44.037 --> 23:45.805
Integrated
investigative bureau.

23:45.872 --> 23:46.939
Oh yeah.

23:47.006 --> 23:48.240
It's right... it's
right there.

23:48.308 --> 23:50.810
[inaudible]

23:50.877 --> 23:52.211
The Mounties?

23:52.278 --> 23:55.748
Yeah some of us; some
provincial, some local.

23:55.816 --> 23:57.515
We all get together
and nab the bad guys.

23:57.583 --> 24:01.053
Right, like a police
all-star team.

24:01.120 --> 24:02.654
Here is my card.

24:02.722 --> 24:07.625
Give me a call if you have
any more amazing insights.

24:07.693 --> 24:10.428
<i>[hearing spell] Okay,
go now, bye, bye.</i>

24:10.496 --> 24:12.796
I'll show myself
out, thank you.

24:12.865 --> 24:14.098
You're welcome.

24:15.400 --> 24:16.467
Hey Oz, come here.

24:16.534 --> 24:17.902
Excuse me.

24:17.970 --> 24:19.470
What's the deal batman,
do you got anything?

24:19.537 --> 24:20.504
I'm going to be a couple of
hours; you got to cover for me.

24:20.572 --> 24:21.973
Huh?

24:22.040 --> 24:27.411
Oh, you got that look
of quiet determination.

24:27.479 --> 24:29.045
You know what to do Robin.

24:29.113 --> 24:30.580
Yeah right...

24:30.647 --> 24:34.484
[inaudible], sure it's worked
out so well in the past.

24:39.323 --> 24:41.992
You're late.

24:42.059 --> 24:44.927
The transaction's been made.

24:45.028 --> 24:48.397
Not that I don't trust you
but let's see if there's

24:48.464 --> 24:50.665
been any recent
activity in my account.

24:50.733 --> 24:54.069
[whistling]

24:55.105 --> 24:56.738
Well, well, you are
a man of your word.

24:56.806 --> 24:59.708
Drive.

24:59.776 --> 25:00.775
There you go.

25:00.842 --> 25:02.442
[♪]

25:11.120 --> 25:12.954
Nice doing business with you.

25:13.022 --> 25:14.622
[♪]

25:21.296 --> 25:24.831
[inaudible]

25:24.899 --> 25:27.334
You son of a....[struggle]

25:27.402 --> 25:30.537
[♪]

25:32.417 --> 25:35.585
I didn't even
know my own name...

25:35.653 --> 25:38.488
...till you called it
out to me.

25:38.556 --> 25:43.025
It's called selective memory;
were trying to refresh it.

25:43.093 --> 25:46.328
Do you recognize him?

25:46.396 --> 25:48.364
No.

25:48.432 --> 25:50.999
I don't think so.

25:51.068 --> 25:55.571
Steven Murchin, an
environmental scientist.

25:55.638 --> 25:57.939
He did work for your company.

25:58.006 --> 26:01.242
Four weeks ago he died
in a car accident.

26:01.310 --> 26:02.677
I'm sorry...

26:02.744 --> 26:04.011
Yeah, it was terrible.

26:04.080 --> 26:07.148
He left behind a
wife and three kids.

26:07.216 --> 26:10.017
When the lab examined
Steven's vehicle they

26:10.086 --> 26:14.721
found that his brakes
had been tampered with.

26:14.789 --> 26:16.790
When we questioned his
co-workers we found out

26:16.857 --> 26:19.226
that he was working on a
report about the toxicity

26:19.294 --> 26:23.263
levels from the runoff of
one of Northern's mines.

26:23.331 --> 26:26.567
If this was supposed to
help me get my memory back

26:26.634 --> 26:28.734
it's a colossal failure.

26:28.802 --> 26:32.938
Well that's okay; I'm a lot
more patient than I let on.

26:35.041 --> 26:36.641

26:48.588 --> 26:50.188

[knock on door]

27:20.884 --> 27:22.318
Oh...

27:28.959 --> 27:30.926
Hello, hi ma'am,
I'm a paramedic.

27:30.994 --> 27:32.461
My name's Toby Logan.

27:32.529 --> 27:34.329
I was just hoping that
maybe we could have a word.

27:34.397 --> 27:35.631
Is someone hurt?

27:35.698 --> 27:38.267
Actually yeah,
that's why I'm here.

27:38.334 --> 27:41.403
I think you might
be able to help me.

27:41.471 --> 27:44.072
It's about a woman
named Lynn Kendal.

27:44.140 --> 27:45.907
Lynn?

27:45.975 --> 27:47.709
And what does this
have to do with me?

27:47.777 --> 27:49.577
Well Ms. Kendal's having
difficult remember certain

27:49.645 --> 27:51.979
things about her past so I
was just hoping that maybe

27:52.047 --> 27:55.183
you knew something about how
we could locate her family.

27:55.250 --> 27:57.485
And you say she mentioned
me specifically?

27:57.553 --> 28:00.421
Yes, she said that you met
her at a café and that you

28:00.489 --> 28:02.190
were very upset with her.

28:02.257 --> 28:05.425
<i>[hearing spell]: How did he
find me? No one knows I'm here.</i>

28:05.493 --> 28:07.227
Look did they send you here?

28:07.295 --> 28:09.462
They? No, no, it's just me.

28:09.530 --> 28:14.401
After she met with you
Lynn was attacked and

28:14.468 --> 28:17.003
she nearly drowned.

28:17.071 --> 28:21.574
The police aren't ruling
out attempted murder.

28:21.641 --> 28:25.745
You wouldn't know anything
about that would you?

28:25.813 --> 28:27.346
How dare you accuse me!

28:27.414 --> 28:28.715
They killed my husband.

28:28.782 --> 28:30.683
They threatened me and my kids.

28:30.751 --> 28:32.885
How could you say that to me;
how could you say that to me?

28:32.953 --> 28:34.120
Okay.

28:34.188 --> 28:36.922
[crying]

28:36.989 --> 28:39.591
Let me take you back.

28:39.658 --> 28:43.862
2006, a community in
Alberta is contaminated

28:43.930 --> 28:47.532
by the [inaudible] from a
Northern Superior mine;

28:47.600 --> 28:49.467
lawsuit disappears.

28:49.535 --> 28:53.304
2007 allegations of
insider trading by senior

28:53.372 --> 28:58.843
company brass are raised
and mysteriously go away.

28:58.910 --> 29:01.045
I'm supposed to
know about all this?

29:04.483 --> 29:10.354
2009 Gerry Morrow, your
CEO, his son was involved

29:10.421 --> 29:14.991
in a hit and run,
charges were dropped.

29:15.059 --> 29:18.128
So what do all of these
cases have in common?

29:18.195 --> 29:24.468
Okay even if I worked for
this Northern Superior,

29:24.535 --> 29:29.872
what is this; guilt
by association?

29:29.939 --> 29:34.943
Now the lawyer emerges...

29:36.913 --> 29:40.115
...you know what a corporate
fixer is, right Lynn?

29:40.183 --> 29:43.585
Yeah, that's the nice term.

29:43.653 --> 29:46.188
I don't, I don't
believe any of this.

29:46.256 --> 29:49.258
Well this is who you are
and believe me the deeper

29:49.325 --> 29:51.260
we dig the worse it gets.

29:51.327 --> 29:53.162
[♪]

29:53.229 --> 29:55.563
Now this is where
it gets interesting.

29:55.631 --> 29:59.100
How do you explain this?

30:01.536 --> 30:05.273
Roman Prisblanski, he was
in the IT department of

30:05.340 --> 30:07.541
Northern Superior.

30:07.609 --> 30:09.310
I have never even
heard the name.

30:09.377 --> 30:12.613
Well he was found dead
today; the bodies are

30:12.681 --> 30:15.715
beginning to pile up.

30:15.783 --> 30:21.087
Look, I might not know
who I am but I am not the

30:21.155 --> 30:23.123
monster you think.

30:25.293 --> 30:29.529
Yes, she came to the island.

30:29.596 --> 30:31.396
I was furious because I
thought she was going to

30:31.464 --> 30:33.732
offer me some deal but...

30:33.800 --> 30:36.068
And did she?

30:36.136 --> 30:37.837
No.

30:37.904 --> 30:39.571
She said she wanted
my help to prove that

30:39.639 --> 30:45.010
Northern Superior Mining was
behind my husband's death.

30:45.078 --> 30:48.746
How was she going
to prove that?

30:48.814 --> 30:51.382
She said she wanted to go
through Steve's computer

30:51.450 --> 30:55.854
to find some report
that he'd been writing.

30:55.921 --> 31:00.825
And this guy, this guy
Roman showed up two days

31:00.893 --> 31:03.193
after Steve died and he
said he was from the

31:03.261 --> 31:07.664
company and he said that
they wanted take

31:07.732 --> 31:10.200
possession of his computer.

31:10.268 --> 31:12.769
Oh, I was so stupid!

31:12.837 --> 31:15.472
I should have listened to Lynn.

31:15.539 --> 31:19.075
Sarah, you have to
go to the police.

31:19.142 --> 31:20.642
If you don't Lynn
will be charged for

31:20.710 --> 31:23.079
your husband's murder.

31:23.146 --> 31:27.350
He was just a scientist
doing his job.

31:36.859 --> 31:39.694
Why were you going
to Toronto Island?

31:39.762 --> 31:42.397
I don't even remember
being there.

31:42.464 --> 31:43.865
Oh my god!

31:43.933 --> 31:48.603
Yeah, that's you getting
on the ferry two days ago.

31:50.772 --> 31:55.109
Starting to come back.

31:55.176 --> 31:57.077
Who were you looking for?

31:57.145 --> 32:01.415
Who is that?

32:01.482 --> 32:03.617
You tell me.

32:03.684 --> 32:06.252
That's uh...

32:06.320 --> 32:09.889
...that's the man who
tried to kill me.

32:09.957 --> 32:11.891
[♪]

32:14.093 --> 32:15.661
The client is pressing
me to charge her

32:15.729 --> 32:17.730
or cut her loose.

32:17.798 --> 32:19.365
Who is this guy?

32:19.433 --> 32:22.301
Either this surveillance is
too grainy for the computer

32:22.369 --> 32:24.235
or this guy just doesn't
have a criminal record.

32:24.303 --> 32:25.704
This is crazy.

32:25.771 --> 32:26.705
This would be so much
easier if someone would

32:26.772 --> 32:28.172
just get their memory back.

32:28.240 --> 32:30.842
Yeah?

32:30.909 --> 32:33.144
Okay, send them up.

32:34.447 --> 32:36.514
It's about to get crazier.

32:36.582 --> 32:38.082
What; crazier?

32:43.287 --> 32:46.824
This must be the woman you
were telling me about.

32:46.891 --> 32:48.525
Hello Mrs. Murchin.

32:48.593 --> 32:49.626
Have we met?

32:49.694 --> 32:51.294
No, not personally.

32:51.363 --> 32:53.764
You've been a very
difficult woman to reach.

32:53.832 --> 32:56.366
Why don't you have a seat
in our conference room.

32:56.400 --> 32:57.967
Dev will show you the room.

32:58.034 --> 32:59.969
Right this way.

33:02.105 --> 33:03.773
I don't know what you're
up to but you and I need

33:03.841 --> 33:06.942
to have a little
chat, so stick around.

33:07.010 --> 33:08.911
Look forward to it.

33:08.979 --> 33:10.579
[♪]

33:15.418 --> 33:17.018
[♪]

33:22.892 --> 33:27.461
That's Steve Murchin's wife.

33:28.997 --> 33:30.664
She's going to tell them
that you were going to

33:30.732 --> 33:34.702
expose the company.

33:34.770 --> 33:36.303
[♪]

33:36.371 --> 33:38.272
That's a really good thing.

33:38.339 --> 33:40.875
I don't know Toby; I was
told about all these

33:40.942 --> 33:43.076
things that I've done.

33:43.144 --> 33:45.077
You went out there to tell
Sarah the truth about her

33:45.145 --> 33:46.479
husband's death.

33:46.547 --> 33:49.115
You went out there to
take down your employer.

33:49.182 --> 33:52.184
You put yourself in danger
and they tried to kill you.

33:52.252 --> 33:55.988
You were a whistle-blower.

33:58.426 --> 34:00.158
<i>[hearing spell] Lynn come
on I thought we were</i>

34:00.226 --> 34:01.827
<i>in this together.</i>

34:01.895 --> 34:04.362
<i>You know what this does to
me; I will not be a party</i>

34:04.431 --> 34:05.431
<i>to this.</i>

34:05.498 --> 34:06.832
<i>I can't protect you...</i>

34:09.469 --> 34:11.770
I might be the only one
who could stop them.

34:15.641 --> 34:18.743
I didn't pressure
her; she volunteered.

34:18.811 --> 34:21.344
The woman's barely got a
grasp on her own memories.

34:21.413 --> 34:22.847
She remembers enough.

34:22.915 --> 34:24.315
What are you proposing.

34:24.382 --> 34:26.717
She calls Gerry,
sets up a meeting.

34:26.784 --> 34:28.319
Wears a wire, records her boss.

34:28.386 --> 34:31.888
Yeah and if the thing goes
south we'll be right there.

34:31.956 --> 34:33.188
We'll be right there, yeah.

34:33.257 --> 34:34.190
Yeah, I've heard that before.

34:34.257 --> 34:38.862
[♪]

34:38.929 --> 34:41.931
Hi, can you hear me
guys, am I transmitting?

34:41.998 --> 34:43.900
<i>Check.</i>

34:43.967 --> 34:47.136
<i>Copy that loud and clear.</i>

34:47.204 --> 34:50.806
Okay we're up.

34:50.873 --> 34:53.775
Hey Michelle I don't know
what this guys doing here;

34:53.844 --> 34:55.744
you got a bogey game
at 1:00 o'clock.

34:55.812 --> 34:56.846
Who the hell is this guy?

34:56.913 --> 34:58.513
[♪]

35:04.720 --> 35:06.120
What the hell do you
think you're doing here?

35:06.188 --> 35:07.722
Keeping an eye on Lynn.

35:07.790 --> 35:09.156
You're going to blow
this whole operation.

35:09.224 --> 35:10.458
Don't worry; I'm not going
to do anything stupid.

35:10.526 --> 35:11.626
Yeah I hope not.

35:11.694 --> 35:12.694
<i>Michelle, there's our guy!</i>

35:12.761 --> 35:14.395
[♪]

35:14.463 --> 35:16.230
<i>Yeah, that's Gerry Morrow.</i>

35:16.298 --> 35:17.799
<i>Okay guys, we're on.</i>

35:17.867 --> 35:21.267
[♪]

35:21.335 --> 35:23.336
It's good to see you Lynn.

35:23.404 --> 35:25.138
You too Gerry.

35:25.206 --> 35:26.773
You sounded surprised
when I called.

35:26.841 --> 35:28.274
Did I?

35:28.342 --> 35:31.845
Yeah, bit like you'd heard
the voice of a ghost.

35:31.913 --> 35:34.548
[hearing spell]

35:34.616 --> 35:37.249
<i>Do it and keep moving.</i>

35:37.317 --> 35:38.450
Something's wrong?

35:38.519 --> 35:39.719
What are you talking about?

35:39.786 --> 35:43.923
Steve Murchin had a wife
Gerry, three kids

35:43.991 --> 35:46.692
and you had him killed.

35:46.760 --> 35:49.128
You just don't get it.

35:49.195 --> 35:51.296
I think this
conversation's over.

35:53.633 --> 35:56.801
<i>No second
chances this time.</i>

35:56.869 --> 35:59.237
Check out the jogger.

35:59.304 --> 36:01.105
That's our guy.

36:01.173 --> 36:02.841
Dev that's the guy
from the ferry.

36:02.909 --> 36:04.409
All units take down the jogger.

36:04.476 --> 36:06.076
[♪]

36:17.022 --> 36:18.856
[struggle]

36:18.924 --> 36:20.024
Come on, give me those
hands, give me those.

36:20.091 --> 36:22.092
[sirens]

36:22.160 --> 36:23.760
[♪]

36:31.169 --> 36:32.969
How did you know he
was carrying a needle

36:33.037 --> 36:35.638
and not a gun?

36:35.706 --> 36:37.840
I'm going to be
needing a statement.

36:37.908 --> 36:40.842
I'll drop by.

36:41.711 --> 36:44.080
He connected that jogger with
the Toronto Island jogger. How?

36:44.147 --> 36:45.314
He knew where to find Sarah.

36:45.382 --> 36:46.949
How?

36:47.016 --> 36:50.152
Yeah, I don't know Dev, but
I plan to get some answers.

36:57.093 --> 36:59.360
Mr. Bay?

37:03.632 --> 37:05.600
You write this?

37:05.667 --> 37:09.137
Yeah, it's a little
over the right?

37:09.205 --> 37:13.073
All that stuff about team
versus any single one of us?

37:13.141 --> 37:15.041
It's not half bad.

37:15.110 --> 37:16.443
Really?

37:16.511 --> 37:19.513
Well punctuation was
atrocious but you got the

37:19.581 --> 37:20.880
heart of a poet.

37:20.948 --> 37:22.549
Thank you sir.

37:22.617 --> 37:24.218
Yeah.

37:24.285 --> 37:27.154
You know if you ask me it's
an honor that's long overdue.

37:27.188 --> 37:28.421
Oh I wouldn't say that.

37:28.489 --> 37:29.855
Really?

37:29.923 --> 37:31.857
Mr. Bay you have to learn
how to take a compliment.

37:31.925 --> 37:34.427
Yeah, among other things.

37:34.495 --> 37:35.961
Look, when you're up on that
stage and all those people

37:36.029 --> 37:39.064
are applauding, you
got to be humble, but you

37:39.133 --> 37:43.169
got to know that you
earned it, and you did it.

37:43.270 --> 37:44.336
I'm proud of you.

37:44.403 --> 37:46.371
[♪]

37:46.439 --> 37:48.806
Ah, sir?

37:48.841 --> 37:50.275
Can I have my
partner from that call

37:50.343 --> 37:52.344
come up on stage with me?

37:52.445 --> 37:53.645
Watanabe?

37:53.679 --> 37:54.812
Watananabi sir.

37:54.880 --> 37:57.081
Yeah, he'd feel
better about it.

37:57.116 --> 37:59.684
Even though he was the
junior paramedic on the scene?

37:59.785 --> 38:00.984
I couldn't have
done it without him.

38:01.052 --> 38:02.586
Really?

38:02.654 --> 38:05.256
Okay well, I'll make it happen.

38:05.323 --> 38:06.757
Thank you sir.

38:06.824 --> 38:11.762
Oh and Mr. Bay, clean up the
damn truck; it's filthy.

38:14.032 --> 38:15.866
Good talk.

38:15.933 --> 38:17.533
[♪]

38:28.612 --> 38:30.547
How'd it go up there?

38:30.614 --> 38:34.183
Oh good.

38:34.250 --> 38:38.053
Guess they got more than
they expected from Gerry.

38:38.120 --> 38:41.823
I spent ten years of my
life building that company up

38:41.891 --> 38:44.092
and today I
helped tear it down.

38:44.160 --> 38:46.228
Good for you.

38:46.296 --> 38:47.429
It's scary.

38:47.497 --> 38:50.598
So what are you
going to do next?

38:50.666 --> 38:53.634
Calgary...apparently
I have a life there.

38:53.702 --> 38:55.169
I'm jealous.

38:55.237 --> 38:58.472
[laughter]

38:58.540 --> 39:00.608
What?

39:00.676 --> 39:03.977
Well I'm just remember the
fact that the first moment

39:04.045 --> 39:07.547
I met you I bolted in
the opposite direction.

39:07.615 --> 39:12.352
Right, I mean you were
going to jump in the lake...

39:12.420 --> 39:13.986
Well I think you're
headed in the right

39:14.054 --> 39:15.955
direction now, that's good.

39:16.023 --> 39:17.824
Thank you Toby.

39:17.891 --> 39:19.492
You're welcome.

39:19.560 --> 39:22.628
[laughter]

39:22.696 --> 39:25.598
Good luck.

39:25.665 --> 39:28.867
You too.

39:28.935 --> 39:30.535
[♪]

39:35.542 --> 39:37.142
[♪]

39:46.452 --> 39:49.186
Dr. Lawson was right;
Lynn's memory loss turned

39:49.255 --> 39:50.821
out to be temporary.

39:50.889 --> 39:52.756
Come on, what about us; we
were the ones who rescued her,

39:52.823 --> 39:54.391
Toby jogged her memory.

39:54.459 --> 39:55.692
Thank you.

39:55.760 --> 39:57.361
Credit where credit
is due my friend.

39:57.428 --> 39:59.028
Thank you.

39:59.096 --> 40:01.365
Where it is, Lynn's got a man
waiting for her in Calgary.

40:01.432 --> 40:02.866
She's got a man, that's good.

40:02.933 --> 40:04.368
It's kind of weird though;
what does she do,

40:04.435 --> 40:06.770
just gets off the plane in
Calgary and waits for the

40:06.837 --> 40:09.037
first guy to kiss her?

40:09.105 --> 40:11.540
All I know is a couple of
months ago you sir would

40:11.608 --> 40:13.442
never have gotten involved.

40:13.510 --> 40:15.010
People change.

40:15.078 --> 40:17.679
Feels good.

40:17.747 --> 40:20.015
Charlie would have been proud.

40:22.152 --> 40:24.052
Charlie.

40:25.588 --> 40:27.689
She was pretty amazing.

40:30.093 --> 40:31.593
Speaking of hot cops...

40:31.661 --> 40:33.027
Don't go there.

40:33.095 --> 40:34.262
Don't go there?

40:34.329 --> 40:35.763
Yeah.

40:35.831 --> 40:36.898
Who?

40:36.965 --> 40:38.099
Ahh..

40:38.167 --> 40:39.300
Forget it.

40:39.367 --> 40:40.935
Oh I've forgotten about it.

40:41.003 --> 40:42.403
You brought it up.

40:42.470 --> 40:43.771
No you brought it up.

40:43.839 --> 40:45.372
I didn't bring up
anything...I didn't...

40:45.440 --> 40:47.608
[♪]

40:47.676 --> 40:48.842
Just trying to back out
of it...
