WEBVTT

00:10.844 --> 00:12.812
So now it's Buzz Magazi <i>n</i> e?

00:12.846 --> 00:16.282
Yeah. Buzz off.

00:16.315 --> 00:18.910
Are you sure I can't interest
you in this cup of coffee?

00:18.952 --> 00:20.146
No strings attached.

00:20.186 --> 00:21.551
No, thanks.

00:21.588 --> 00:24.216
Okay, 'cause...

00:24.257 --> 00:26.919
there's a string attached.

00:26.960 --> 00:29.428
Have a nice day.

00:29.462 --> 00:30.986
It's a letter for Toni.

00:31.097 --> 00:32.997
I want you to give it to her.

00:33.099 --> 00:34.657
I'm not giving her
anything from you.

00:34.701 --> 00:36.862
Bruno, I never meant
to hurt her. I...

00:36.903 --> 00:38.200
Just give this to her.

00:38.238 --> 00:39.170
Why should I?

00:39.205 --> 00:40.172
Because you care about her.

00:40.206 --> 00:41.764
You care about her
as much as I do.

00:41.808 --> 00:43.173
If you want,
you can read it yourself.

00:43.209 --> 00:44.506
Let it be, McKay.

00:44.544 --> 00:46.910
Just scram before
she comes out of class.

00:51.418 --> 00:53.079
Tell me something.

00:54.621 --> 00:58.250
What's more important to you...
love or vengeance?

00:58.291 --> 01:00.486
Keeping Toni or
destroying her father?

01:02.000 --> 01:08.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:48.401 --> 02:51.768
Advertising is sex,
and sex is advertising.

02:51.804 --> 02:54.102
Now, I know you've all seen

02:54.140 --> 02:56.108
a million beer
and soda commercials,

02:56.142 --> 02:57.973
and you know
they're not gonna get

02:58.011 --> 03:00.844
some professorial guy like me
to stand here at a lectern

03:00.880 --> 03:03.246
and recite the merits
of a particular drink.

03:03.283 --> 03:05.251
Of course not.

03:05.285 --> 03:07.685
They're gonna get
a gorgeous girl like this,

03:07.720 --> 03:09.551
and they're gonna
put her in a bikini,

03:09.589 --> 03:10.715
sit her by the pool,

03:10.757 --> 03:13.089
as she sensually
sips her drink,

03:13.126 --> 03:15.560
licking her lips in delight.

03:17.664 --> 03:18.756
Yes?

03:18.798 --> 03:21.096
Professor Haywood,
just because it sells,

03:21.134 --> 03:22.931
it doesn't make it right.

03:22.969 --> 03:25.699
I mean, you're talking
about the exploitation of women,

03:25.738 --> 03:27.262
and I find it offensive.

03:27.307 --> 03:28.467
Well, I'm sorry, Ms. Keats,

03:28.508 --> 03:30.066
I didn't mean
to offend you personally,

03:30.109 --> 03:32.134
but this is a class
in marketing, not ethics.

03:32.178 --> 03:33.543
And frankly,

03:33.580 --> 03:34.911
sex sells.

03:40.587 --> 03:42.555
Ooh! I hate that guy.

03:42.589 --> 03:44.454
Then why'd you take the class?

03:44.490 --> 03:46.219
I don't know...
the way it's going,

03:46.259 --> 03:48.489
I'm never gonna get a
decent grade from him.

03:48.528 --> 03:49.995
You want to grab some lunch?

03:50.063 --> 03:52.497
No, actually, I'm gonna
catch up with Professor Haywood

03:52.532 --> 03:54.500
and apologize for
being late for class.

03:54.534 --> 03:57.332
Show some cleavage,
you might get an "A."

03:57.370 --> 04:01.704
There's nothing wrong with
being nice to a teacher.

04:01.741 --> 04:04.471
Uh, Professor Haywood?

04:04.510 --> 04:07.411
Excuse me, uh, Valerie Malone.

04:07.447 --> 04:09.881
Oh, yes, the little distracter
from this morning.

04:09.916 --> 04:11.816
Yeah, I'm really sorry
about that.

04:11.851 --> 04:13.216
It-it won't happen again.

04:13.253 --> 04:14.948
Humility is very becoming,
Ms. Malone.

04:15.021 --> 04:16.716
- You're forgiven.
- Thanks.

04:16.755 --> 04:18.724
Since I have you here...

04:18.757 --> 04:21.817
Do you have any idea when
we'll get our midterms back?

04:21.861 --> 04:23.829
Don't be so eager. You might
not like the grade I give you.

04:23.863 --> 04:25.854
Well, I really got
into the project.

04:25.898 --> 04:28.890
Actually, I modeled my campaign
after the business I run.

04:28.935 --> 04:31.426
Well, great, then I'm sure
you'll do very well. Excuse me.

04:31.471 --> 04:32.699
Well, I hope so.

04:32.739 --> 04:34.900
I really love that class.

04:37.477 --> 04:39.445
Well, you know, in that case,

04:39.479 --> 04:41.970
this may be
of some value to you.

04:42.081 --> 04:43.605
I'm giving a lecture
this afternoon

04:43.650 --> 04:44.912
for some local
business executives,

04:44.951 --> 04:46.976
and I'll be addressing
some of the topics

04:47.053 --> 04:48.315
we've been covering in class.

04:48.354 --> 04:50.185
You might get something
out of this.

04:50.223 --> 04:51.383
That would be great.

04:51.424 --> 04:52.982
Um, where is it being held?

04:53.059 --> 04:54.549
Century Plaza Hotel...
the small meeting room

04:54.594 --> 04:56.118
next to the lobby, about 4:00.

04:56.162 --> 04:57.925
I can do that.

04:57.964 --> 04:59.761
Good.

04:59.799 --> 05:02.063
You know, I have to say this.

05:02.101 --> 05:04.365
You smell terrific.
What are you wearing?

05:04.404 --> 05:06.565
It's called Invitation.

05:06.606 --> 05:09.507
Everything does come down
to marketing, doesn't it?

05:09.542 --> 05:11.271
Yeah. Thanks.

05:11.311 --> 05:12.642
You're welcome.

05:12.679 --> 05:13.839
- See you later.
- Bye.

05:13.880 --> 05:15.142
Bye.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.842
I can't believe
you made second cut.

05:19.886 --> 05:22.150
You might actually make
it to the Rose Court.

05:22.188 --> 05:24.053
Yeah, well, I can't
believe it either.

05:24.090 --> 05:25.557
My next interview's tomorrow.

05:25.591 --> 05:28.890
- I just wish I could get more
up for it. - Why? What's wrong?

05:28.928 --> 05:31.692
I have to meet Ray tonight
at the Peach Pit.

05:31.731 --> 05:33.961
- Ugh. - You know,
every time I think of him,

05:34.033 --> 05:35.523
it just brings me down.

05:35.568 --> 05:37.433
- So cancel.
- I can't.

05:37.470 --> 05:39.870
I have his songwriting book;
I said I'd return it.

05:39.906 --> 05:41.339
I'll take it back for you.

05:41.374 --> 05:42.966
Or why don't you just ask Nat?

05:43.076 --> 05:44.873
He's expecting me.

05:44.911 --> 05:47.379
I mean, I at least
owe him that, right?

05:47.413 --> 05:48.778
Sanders alert.

05:48.815 --> 05:50.077
Don't let Steve see me.

05:50.116 --> 05:51.606
I thought things
were working out

05:51.651 --> 05:54.313
- for you guys.
- Yeah, they are, but, um,

05:54.354 --> 05:57.983
now he wants to know if he
should get a hotel room.

05:58.091 --> 06:01.492
Well, I mean, if you don't
want to, just tell him no.

06:01.527 --> 06:03.757
I'm just, I don't know.
I'm just nervous.

06:03.796 --> 06:06.526
I don't think he's ready
for the kind of relationship

06:06.566 --> 06:07.828
I want this time around.

06:07.867 --> 06:09.698
The whole thing's
giving me a migraine.

06:09.736 --> 06:11.533
Well, you don't have to tell me.

06:11.571 --> 06:13.368
Sex is one big headache.

06:13.406 --> 06:15.203
And not that I'd know.

06:16.642 --> 06:19.509
I saw Dylan today.

06:19.545 --> 06:22.343
He gave me a letter for you.

06:22.382 --> 06:24.145
You should read it.

06:24.183 --> 06:25.946
I don't want to read it, okay?

06:26.052 --> 06:29.385
Maybe it'll help get him
out of your system.

06:40.266 --> 06:42.962
Toni, I'm sure
I'm the last person

06:43.002 --> 06:45.197
you want to hear from
right now,

06:45.238 --> 06:47.536
but I couldn't stop myself.

06:47.573 --> 06:50.736
Whatever it is
between your father and me

06:50.777 --> 06:54.907
had nothing to do
with the way I feel about you.

06:54.947 --> 06:56.915
You're an incredible woman.

06:56.949 --> 06:58.917
I know you'll find happiness

06:58.951 --> 07:03.183
with someone who deserves you
a hell of a lot more than I do.

07:03.222 --> 07:05.213
Love, Dylan.

07:11.898 --> 07:13.798
Here you go, Brandon.

07:13.833 --> 07:15.824
A grilled cheese sandwich
just like your mother made.

07:15.868 --> 07:17.392
Ah, thanks, Nat, but I think

07:17.437 --> 07:19.530
she's making it
mu shu style about now.

07:19.572 --> 07:20.903
Yeah, that wouldn't surprise me.

07:20.940 --> 07:22.908
She did send me a wok
for my birthday.

07:22.942 --> 07:24.534
So, uh, you think

07:24.577 --> 07:26.772
the folks'll be back home
for the holidays?

07:26.813 --> 07:28.610
Thanksgiving, no;
Christmas, maybe.

07:28.648 --> 07:30.343
That'd be great.

07:30.383 --> 07:32.374
Don't worry, Steve.
They won't evict you.

07:32.418 --> 07:33.680
That's not my problem.

07:33.719 --> 07:36.244
Ah, did you get dumped again?

07:38.524 --> 07:39.650
No.

07:39.692 --> 07:41.626
Ah, sorry.

07:44.797 --> 07:47.766
Could we get back
to my problem now?

07:47.800 --> 07:49.290
What do you think
of the De La Mer Hotel?

07:49.335 --> 07:53.294
Classy, but I think Clare is
more the mirrored-ceiling type.

07:53.339 --> 07:55.204
I think so, too, but
I don't want to be too obvious.

07:55.241 --> 07:57.368
Are you sure
you want to do this?

07:57.410 --> 08:00.345
Well, between you and me,
I'm having a little trouble

08:00.379 --> 08:02.904
imagining myself waking up
with her in the morning.

08:03.015 --> 08:05.006
You may have to chew
your arm off to escape.

08:05.051 --> 08:07.645
Won't be the first time
I stepped in a bear trap.

08:07.687 --> 08:09.655
So take it slow.
Nothing wrong with that.

08:09.689 --> 08:10.849
Is that what you did with Susan?

08:10.890 --> 08:13.154
Hey, my first morning
with Susan was a bitch.

08:13.192 --> 08:15.183
She had me
make her bed three times.

08:16.195 --> 08:17.389
Long story.

08:17.430 --> 08:19.227
Well, do you regret it?

08:23.135 --> 08:25.228
Hi, Kel. How's it going?

08:25.271 --> 08:27.330
Hey, guys.
I don't mean to interrupt,

08:27.373 --> 08:29.432
but I was just wanting
to make sure

08:29.475 --> 08:31.272
that you're both coming
to Colin's opening.

08:31.310 --> 08:32.868
- Absolutely.
- That's the plan.

08:32.912 --> 08:34.880
Good.

08:34.914 --> 08:36.881
What were you talking about?

08:36.916 --> 08:38.246
- Love.
- Sex.

08:39.284 --> 08:40.183
Love.

08:40.219 --> 08:40.913
Sex.

08:42.922 --> 08:43.785
Love and sex.

08:43.823 --> 08:45.757
Love and sex.

08:47.393 --> 08:50.089
Think you invited enough

08:50.129 --> 08:52.620
of your little friends?

08:52.665 --> 08:55.156
Art is for the people.

08:56.502 --> 09:00.165
This is an art opening,
not a bargain basement.

09:00.206 --> 09:02.800
They're nice people, Claudia.

09:02.842 --> 09:04.139
Right.

09:04.176 --> 09:07.270
And Kelly, she's
very knowledgeable.

09:07.313 --> 09:09.213
Right.
Like all your other

09:09.248 --> 09:10.738
little side dishes.

09:10.783 --> 09:12.410
Hey.

09:12.451 --> 09:14.476
You don't have to insult her.

09:14.520 --> 09:15.612
Why?

09:15.655 --> 09:17.418
Are you getting
serious about her?

09:17.456 --> 09:18.616
What if I am?

09:18.658 --> 09:21.855
I just think too much
emotional involvement

09:21.894 --> 09:24.055
would be bad for your work.

09:26.732 --> 09:29.496
Let's concentrate
on the show, okay?

09:38.077 --> 09:40.375
Well, thank you all very much.

09:40.413 --> 09:42.142
I enjoyed this afternoon a lot.

09:42.181 --> 09:44.479
I hope you'll invite me back.
Excuse me.

09:44.517 --> 09:45.848
How'd I do?

09:45.885 --> 09:47.512
Excellent.

09:47.553 --> 09:49.885
Thanks for inviting me.
I learned so much.

09:49.922 --> 09:52.447
Well, if this is something
you're really interested in,

09:52.491 --> 09:54.459
it's never too early to make
the important contacts.

09:54.493 --> 09:55.926
God, I love this business.

09:55.962 --> 09:57.759
I could keep talking for hours.

09:57.797 --> 09:59.662
- Can I buy you a drink?
- Yeah, sure.

09:59.699 --> 10:00.825
Great.

10:00.866 --> 10:02.026
Okay.

10:03.436 --> 10:05.461
When I was an account exec
on Madison Avenue,

10:05.504 --> 10:07.301
I'll never forget working
on this doll account

10:07.340 --> 10:08.329
that shall remain nameless.

10:08.374 --> 10:10.865
Talk about sexual paranoia.

10:10.910 --> 10:12.571
When they shot the commercials,

10:12.612 --> 10:14.705
they actually made up
little towels

10:14.747 --> 10:16.977
so the sexy little
plastic figure

10:17.016 --> 10:19.712
wouldn't be naked during her
wardrobe changes on the set.

10:19.752 --> 10:22.118
- You're kidding?
- No, I'm not.

10:22.154 --> 10:23.985
They even had
a union worker on board

10:24.023 --> 10:25.650
just to make sure
she never exposed

10:25.691 --> 10:28.387
her anatomically incorrect
plastic breasts.

10:28.427 --> 10:31.555
So, um, why did you
leave the business?

10:31.597 --> 10:33.963
Oh, well, uh,
when my wife died,

10:34.000 --> 10:36.366
I... kind of lost the drive.

10:36.402 --> 10:38.996
And then this job came
along, and I thought,

10:39.038 --> 10:41.905
what better way to pass on
my experience and knowledge

10:41.941 --> 10:44.501
to a whole new crop
of brilliant ad men...

10:44.543 --> 10:45.840
and women,

10:45.878 --> 10:47.743
like yourself.

10:47.780 --> 10:48.872
How about another drink?

10:48.914 --> 10:51.212
Yeah, great. Thanks.

10:51.250 --> 10:52.478
You know, Valerie,

10:52.518 --> 10:54.418
I haven't mentioned this, but...

10:54.453 --> 10:58.116
you actually remind me
a lot of Lily, my wife.

10:58.157 --> 10:59.954
She was...

10:59.992 --> 11:02.688
bright, beautiful, spunky.

11:02.728 --> 11:04.423
You miss her.

11:04.463 --> 11:06.488
Yeah, every day.

11:06.532 --> 11:08.227
And every night.

11:08.267 --> 11:09.962
I'm sorry.

11:10.069 --> 11:12.162
In fact, she used
to come with me

11:12.204 --> 11:14.172
to these seminars
all the time.

11:14.206 --> 11:16.868
You're the first woman
I've invited along since...

11:16.909 --> 11:18.137
she's been gone.

11:19.979 --> 11:21.276
Well, I'm honored.

11:21.313 --> 11:24.942
So, um, do you think
I have a future in this game?

11:24.984 --> 11:26.713
Oh, I read your midterm.

11:26.752 --> 11:28.379
Your campaign is sensational.

11:28.421 --> 11:30.252
It's terrific. Thank you.

11:30.289 --> 11:32.951
- Wow. Thanks. - Well,
don't thank me. You wrote it.

11:32.992 --> 11:36.985
Listen... how about instead of
having the next round down here,

11:37.063 --> 11:39.031
we go up to my room?

11:40.266 --> 11:42.257
Where we'll be more comfortable.

11:42.301 --> 11:44.496
You have a room?

11:44.537 --> 11:46.471
Sure. It comes with the deal.

11:46.505 --> 11:49.372
I don't think so.

11:49.408 --> 11:51.933
I wouldn't want anybody
to get the wrong idea.

11:51.977 --> 11:53.239
Valerie, relax.

11:53.279 --> 11:55.270
I promise to be discreet.

11:55.314 --> 11:56.975
You have nothing to worry about.

11:57.016 --> 12:00.247
No, I think I do,
Professor Haywood.

12:00.286 --> 12:01.651
You're coming on to me.

12:01.687 --> 12:03.086
I'm glad you finally caught on.

12:03.122 --> 12:04.885
I thought I was losing my touch.

12:04.924 --> 12:07.791
Listen, um, I'm sorry.

12:07.827 --> 12:10.057
I'm interested
in your class, not you.

12:10.096 --> 12:11.563
Oh.

12:11.597 --> 12:12.894
Pity.

12:12.932 --> 12:15.833
Good-bye, Professor Haywood.

12:20.039 --> 12:22.269
Good-bye, Ms. Malone.

12:37.389 --> 12:39.118
Ugh.

12:39.158 --> 12:41.285
Your noodles are looking
pretty rubbery there, Steve.

12:41.327 --> 12:42.351
They're edible.

12:42.394 --> 12:44.123
Uh-huh, and what about this?

12:44.163 --> 12:47.655
That I think we're gonna have
to scrape off the burned part.

12:47.700 --> 12:48.997
You know what,
I'm still waiting

12:49.034 --> 12:52.231
for an answer about
tomorrow night from you.

12:52.271 --> 12:54.603
The answer is "yes."

12:54.640 --> 12:56.665
All right, should I book a room?

12:56.709 --> 12:58.142
No, why don't you let me?

12:58.177 --> 13:00.372
Don't trust my taste, huh?

13:00.412 --> 13:01.572
It's not that.

13:01.614 --> 13:04.777
It's just that first times
are important to me.

13:04.817 --> 13:08.218
I don't want, you know, mirrors
on the ceiling or anything.

13:08.254 --> 13:09.687
Hey, guys.

13:09.722 --> 13:10.916
Dinner ready?

13:10.956 --> 13:13.322
Yeah, have a seat.

13:13.359 --> 13:14.621
Oh, yes, it is.

13:14.660 --> 13:15.957
You're quite the homemaker,
Steve.

13:15.995 --> 13:17.553
Yeah, better than I'll ever be.

13:17.596 --> 13:19.257
Should I set a plate for Val?

13:19.298 --> 13:21.391
She left a message saying

13:21.433 --> 13:23.901
she was going to go to a seminar
with her marketing professor.

13:23.936 --> 13:25.460
- You're kidding?
- No.

13:25.504 --> 13:27.870
What's that supposed to mean?

13:27.907 --> 13:28.965
I'm in that class.

13:29.008 --> 13:31.568
Professor Haywood is
a first-rate lech.

13:32.678 --> 13:34.908
Hey, Val. I didn't think

13:34.947 --> 13:36.471
you were gonna make it for chow.

13:36.515 --> 13:38.608
- How was the seminar?
- Fine.

13:38.651 --> 13:39.743
And how's Haywood?

13:39.785 --> 13:40.877
Fine.

13:40.920 --> 13:42.683
- Are you eating?
- No.

13:42.721 --> 13:43.949
What's biting her?

13:43.989 --> 13:45.422
I don't know.

13:45.457 --> 13:47.084
Hey, Val...

13:47.126 --> 13:49.424
Val, what's the matter?

13:49.461 --> 13:51.759
Tell me something, Brandon.

13:51.797 --> 13:53.526
Do I look particularly
trashy tonight?

13:53.566 --> 13:54.863
What?

13:54.900 --> 13:55.924
What I'm wearing.

13:55.968 --> 13:58.129
- No.
- And my forehead?

13:58.170 --> 14:00.365
Do I have the words
"I'm easy" written anywhere?

14:00.406 --> 14:02.431
What happened to you
this afternoon?

14:02.474 --> 14:04.465
I don't want to talk about it.

14:04.510 --> 14:05.704
Val, come back in the kitchen,

14:05.744 --> 14:06.904
have something to eat;
you'll feel better.

14:06.946 --> 14:09.346
I'm not hungry.
Just tell them I'm beat.

14:09.381 --> 14:10.871
I'm going to bed.

14:14.486 --> 14:15.817
Was that my fault?

14:15.855 --> 14:18.824
No, no, I don't think so.

14:36.909 --> 14:39.810
Hey, Donna. Right on time.

14:39.845 --> 14:41.836
I thought we were meeting
in the Peach Pit?

14:41.881 --> 14:44.315
We were, but I had to
clean out my dressing room.

14:44.350 --> 14:47.945
Don't tell me you're afraid
to be alone with me.

14:47.987 --> 14:49.716
No, no, I'm not,
but I can't stay.

14:49.755 --> 14:52.223
Look, you didn't come

14:52.258 --> 14:54.158
all this way just
to give me my book.

14:54.193 --> 14:55.820
Look, don't tell me why I came.

14:55.861 --> 14:57.260
Don't get crazy
on me, all right?

14:57.296 --> 14:58.320
Relax.

14:58.364 --> 14:59.854
I made you a cup of coffee.

14:59.899 --> 15:01.594
Please, sit down.

15:04.136 --> 15:05.569
There you go.

15:05.604 --> 15:07.834
So, uh, how's school going?

15:07.873 --> 15:08.897
Good.

15:08.941 --> 15:10.033
How's the album going?

15:10.075 --> 15:11.372
Great.

15:11.410 --> 15:13.571
Yeah, that's not what I heard.

15:13.612 --> 15:14.943
Barbara Korman told my mom

15:15.047 --> 15:16.776
that you canceled
your last three sessions.

15:16.815 --> 15:19.045
Yeah, well, I had a sore throat.

15:19.084 --> 15:20.847
I didn't really feel
much like singing.

15:20.886 --> 15:24.083
- Ray, you can't do this to
yourself. - Well, it would help

15:24.123 --> 15:25.556
if you would return my calls.

15:25.591 --> 15:27.889
How can you cut me off
like this, Donna?

15:27.927 --> 15:29.451
I need you now, more than ever.

15:29.495 --> 15:31.122
I write my songs for you.

15:31.163 --> 15:34.894
Yeah, well, you never wrote one
about throwing me around.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.128
Donna, please.

15:36.168 --> 15:37.465
Look Ray, we've been in

15:37.503 --> 15:39.300
an abusive relationship.

15:39.338 --> 15:40.635
I've been reading about it

15:40.673 --> 15:42.402
and it's been like
looking in the mirror.

15:42.441 --> 15:43.965
Look, I'm sorry about the past,
all right.

15:44.043 --> 15:45.374
I can't change it.

15:45.411 --> 15:47.402
But I haven't done anything
wrong in a long time.

15:47.446 --> 15:49.243
Now what more do you
want me to do?

15:49.281 --> 15:50.646
You can get help.

15:50.683 --> 15:53.982
Why can't you remember
the incredible summer we had?

15:54.086 --> 15:55.553
I do.

15:55.587 --> 15:57.384
Do you know what
that's called in the book?

15:57.423 --> 15:58.947
It's called
the "honeymoon period."

15:58.991 --> 16:01.323
And I don't want to be around
when the honeymoon's over.

16:01.360 --> 16:03.351
Oh, I get it.
So now, I'm the monster, huh?

16:03.395 --> 16:04.726
Well, you built me up

16:04.763 --> 16:06.924
so I guess it's only fitting
that you tear me down.

16:06.999 --> 16:09.297
This is not my fault.

16:09.335 --> 16:11.326
Yeah, right, you're blameless.

16:12.604 --> 16:14.435
Enjoy your time alone, Donna.

16:43.569 --> 16:44.627
You don't knock?

16:44.670 --> 16:45.864
I did.

16:45.904 --> 16:47.872
When you didn't answer,
I came around.

16:47.906 --> 16:50.136
So, what, you've come
to give me my letter back?

16:50.175 --> 16:54.134
No. This is for you
from Antonia.

16:56.615 --> 16:58.981
But understand, it's the last
communication there'll be.

16:59.051 --> 17:01.519
I understand.

17:01.553 --> 17:03.350
I like you, Dylan.

17:03.389 --> 17:05.721
I wish you luck.

17:08.292 --> 17:10.921
Dear Dylan.

17:11.030 --> 17:13.555
Meet me in the library tomorrow.

18:05.951 --> 18:08.317
Hey.

18:09.788 --> 18:11.278
I was hoping that you'd be here.

18:11.323 --> 18:13.621
Was there ever any
doubt in your mind?

18:13.659 --> 18:15.718
Not anymore.

18:15.761 --> 18:18.355
What about your father?

18:18.397 --> 18:20.524
I know he forbid you to see me.

18:20.566 --> 18:23.558
Well, I'm not listening
to my father.

18:23.602 --> 18:25.069
I'm listening to my heart.

18:25.104 --> 18:27.095
Besides, he's out of town.

18:27.139 --> 18:30.131
So, how much time do we have?

18:30.175 --> 18:31.665
Forever, if you want it.

18:31.710 --> 18:33.701
Do you mean that?

18:33.745 --> 18:37.545
Yes, with all my soul.

18:57.236 --> 18:59.670
Does Bruno know where you are?

18:59.705 --> 19:01.297
Yeah.

19:01.340 --> 19:04.741
He agreed because he doesn't
have my father to answer to.

19:06.979 --> 19:08.913
I kind of ruined
your perfect life.

19:08.981 --> 19:11.142
Yeah. You did.

19:11.183 --> 19:13.777
I'm sorry.

19:13.819 --> 19:15.184
I'm not.

19:17.756 --> 19:20.520
Dylan, I've never been
in love like this before.

19:23.729 --> 19:26.926
You have to stop
hating my father.

19:27.032 --> 19:30.593
How can I do that?

19:30.636 --> 19:35.130
I mean, how can I
after what he did?

19:35.174 --> 19:38.200
No matter what
you think about my father,

19:38.243 --> 19:41.212
he's still my father,
and I will always love him.

19:44.116 --> 19:46.778
Please.

19:46.818 --> 19:49.184
Dylan, he's all
the family I have left.

19:55.127 --> 19:58.756
All right...

19:58.797 --> 20:00.890
I surrender.

20:17.683 --> 20:19.981
Good, fine, all right then,

20:20.052 --> 20:21.781
I'll see you tomorrow.

20:23.355 --> 20:25.755
Nothing like flying into
New York on a hot streak.

20:25.791 --> 20:28.658
Some days the gods smile on us.

20:28.694 --> 20:30.787
Let's swing by
and say good-bye to Antonia.

20:30.829 --> 20:33.195
She's in class, sir.

20:33.232 --> 20:35.928
I know, but I don't want
to leave town

20:35.968 --> 20:37.128
without saying good-bye to her.

20:37.169 --> 20:38.830
I wouldn't want you
to miss your flight.

20:38.870 --> 20:41.338
We've got plenty of time.

20:43.675 --> 20:46.405
You don't think
these pearls are too much?

20:46.445 --> 20:50.006
No, they're perfect for the
little old lady from Pasadena.

20:50.082 --> 20:51.743
Why am I doing this?

20:51.783 --> 20:54.980
Because you were meant to ride
that float on New Year's Day.

20:55.020 --> 20:57.420
Yeah, well, all those girls
have a better shot than I do.

20:57.456 --> 20:59.014
If you want me to come, I will.

20:59.124 --> 21:00.489
I'll drive you down there

21:00.525 --> 21:02.425
and we can rehearse
your interview in the car.

21:02.461 --> 21:05.294
Well, the theme of
this year's Rose Parade

21:05.330 --> 21:07.093
is "Kids, Laughter and Dreams."

21:07.132 --> 21:08.429
How hard can that be?

21:08.467 --> 21:09.798
That depends.

21:09.835 --> 21:11.666
Are you pro or con?

21:11.703 --> 21:12.897
I'll be fine.

21:12.938 --> 21:15.406
Besides, you're busy
with Colin's show.

21:15.440 --> 21:19.399
Actually, I've kind of
been upstaged lately.

21:19.444 --> 21:21.935
His art dealer Claudia's
been all over him.

21:21.980 --> 21:24.278
Yeah, well, he has
to work with her, right?

21:24.316 --> 21:27.479
That depends on your
definition of "work."

21:29.855 --> 21:32.983
Oh. Don't trust him, Kel.
They all cheat.

21:33.025 --> 21:35.516
No, not all of them.

21:36.662 --> 21:38.960
Yeah, that's right.

21:38.997 --> 21:40.965
Some cheat and beat.

21:40.999 --> 21:42.933
What did you say?

21:44.236 --> 21:46.568
Forget it.

21:46.605 --> 21:48.470
Just don't let him hurt you.

21:48.507 --> 21:52.967
Donna, has Ray ever hit you?

21:53.011 --> 21:54.808
Not exactly.

21:54.846 --> 21:56.609
I mean, he yelled.

21:56.648 --> 21:58.548
He shoved.

21:58.583 --> 22:00.915
He pushed.

22:00.952 --> 22:02.510
He threw me
down the stairs once.

22:02.554 --> 22:04.852
Oh, my God, I had no idea.

22:04.890 --> 22:09.520
Yeah, well, I didn't fall down
those stairs in Palm Springs.

22:09.561 --> 22:11.722
But don't worry about it.
It's all over now.

22:11.763 --> 22:14.630
Donna, if anything like this
ever happens again,

22:14.666 --> 22:15.758
you have to tell me.

22:15.801 --> 22:16.790
I'm your friend.

22:16.835 --> 22:18.769
I know.

22:18.804 --> 22:21.739
I just... I thought
it would go away.

22:21.773 --> 22:24.207
And Ray was so insecure
about fitting in,

22:24.242 --> 22:26.472
I didn't want you to hate him.

22:26.511 --> 22:28.843
You cannot go back to him.
He'll do it again.

22:28.880 --> 22:30.211
I know that.

22:31.483 --> 22:33.451
And since I had it out with him,

22:33.485 --> 22:35.578
I've felt stronger than I have
in a long time.

22:35.620 --> 22:38.282
Good.

22:38.323 --> 22:39.483
Good for you.

22:43.962 --> 22:45.623
That's my car.

22:45.664 --> 22:47.359
What's Bruno doing here?

22:47.399 --> 22:49.026
He knows I have
classes until 5:00.

22:51.169 --> 22:52.295
Stop the car.

22:56.141 --> 22:58.871
Hey, Daddy?

22:58.910 --> 23:01.276
I... thought you were
on your way to New York.

23:01.313 --> 23:02.302
Get in the car, Antonia.

23:02.347 --> 23:03.871
No.

23:03.915 --> 23:05.405
Look, Marchette,

23:05.450 --> 23:07.384
I love your daughter.

23:07.419 --> 23:08.408
Yeah, I'm sure you do,

23:08.453 --> 23:10.216
but you can't have her.

23:10.255 --> 23:10.949
Daddy, stop it.

23:11.056 --> 23:12.284
The feud is over.

23:12.324 --> 23:14.519
No, this conversation is over.

23:15.527 --> 23:17.495
Get in the car, Antonia.

23:18.897 --> 23:22.628
Get in the car
and come home with me now...

23:22.667 --> 23:24.635
or don't come home at all.

23:32.043 --> 23:33.476
Good-bye, Antonia.

24:03.241 --> 24:05.732
Cover chapter 16:

24:05.777 --> 24:07.642
"Subliminal Messages,"
for your weekend reading.

24:07.679 --> 24:11.911
And before you go, take
with you your graded midterms.

24:11.950 --> 24:13.611
Mr. Rudnick,

24:13.652 --> 24:17.520
Ms. Harmon...

24:17.556 --> 24:20.252
Ms. Keats.

24:20.292 --> 24:21.452
Moment of truth.

24:21.493 --> 24:23.620
Mr. Silver...

24:23.662 --> 24:26.563
Ms. Malone...

24:28.633 --> 24:31.966
Mr. Park...

24:32.003 --> 24:33.265
Mr. Lin.

24:33.305 --> 24:34.795
Ah...

24:34.840 --> 24:35.807
Well?

24:35.841 --> 24:40.540
Mr. Perkins,
Ms. Velez...

24:40.579 --> 24:42.206
A "D"?

24:42.247 --> 24:43.236
What did you get?

24:43.281 --> 24:46.307
An "A."

24:46.351 --> 24:47.716
This is unbelievable.

24:47.752 --> 24:49.219
Ms. Rollins...

24:49.254 --> 24:51.779
Excuse me, Professor Haywood?

24:51.823 --> 24:52.881
Is there a problem?

24:52.924 --> 24:53.982
Yeah, there's a big problem.

24:54.092 --> 24:55.423
A "D"?

24:55.460 --> 24:57.189
What happened to "terrific"?

24:57.229 --> 24:59.356
What happened to "sensational"?

24:59.397 --> 25:01.922
I'm sorry, I really can't
remember every paper I read,

25:02.000 --> 25:04.833
but you're certainly welcome
to appeal your grade.

25:04.870 --> 25:07.361
I have been known to give papers
a second chance.

25:11.343 --> 25:13.277
I don't get it.
Your paper was great.

25:13.311 --> 25:16.144
I mean, I would have thought
you'd get a gold star.

25:16.181 --> 25:18.081
What's that supposed
to mean?

25:18.116 --> 25:22.052
I guess being nice to the
teacher didn't pay off.

25:22.087 --> 25:23.315
This isn't about being nice.

25:23.355 --> 25:25.823
This guy's got it in for me.

25:25.857 --> 25:27.848
Excuse me.

25:38.703 --> 25:40.534
Here you go. Room 307.

25:40.572 --> 25:41.869
Great. It's perfect.

25:41.907 --> 25:44.102
I hope the flowers are
what you had in mind.

25:44.142 --> 25:45.575
Exactly.

25:45.610 --> 25:47.134
This is one of our finest rooms.

25:47.178 --> 25:49.738
My girlfriend's
got great taste, huh?

25:49.781 --> 25:50.975
Nah, she lucked out.

25:51.049 --> 25:52.846
The National Police
Association's had this place

25:52.884 --> 25:54.146
booked solid the whole week.

25:54.185 --> 25:55.948
Really?
Well, I feel safer already.

25:55.987 --> 25:57.113
Ice?
Room service?

25:57.155 --> 25:58.122
No, no, thanks.

25:58.156 --> 25:59.123
Here you go.

25:59.157 --> 26:00.419
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

26:00.458 --> 26:01.618
Uh, you know what?

26:01.660 --> 26:03.252
I may need
some extra pillows later.

26:03.295 --> 26:04.489
Right in the closet,
top shelf.

26:04.529 --> 26:05.894
Can I get 'em for you?

26:05.931 --> 26:07.660
- I'll take care of it.
- Okay.

26:22.013 --> 26:24.072
"Pleasure Hut"?

26:28.353 --> 26:30.412
Clare!

26:30.455 --> 26:33.788
The demons of generosity,
buda-bing, buda-boom!

26:39.264 --> 26:40.754
You've gotta talk to him,
Valerie.

26:40.799 --> 26:42.892
I can't talk to him.

26:42.934 --> 26:45.061
I can't believe
he gave you a "D"

26:45.103 --> 26:46.468
'cause you wouldn't sleep
with him.

26:46.504 --> 26:48.096
You know, I went
to the seminar with him.

26:48.139 --> 26:49.265
I had a couple drinks.

26:49.307 --> 26:50.899
You know, I acted like
his little groupie.

26:50.942 --> 26:52.204
I mean, what did I expect?

26:52.243 --> 26:53.710
You didn't do anything wrong.

26:53.745 --> 26:56.111
I'm so sorry
I teased you about this.

26:56.147 --> 26:59.878
Wait. The administration
has rules about this, right?

26:59.918 --> 27:02.318
Yeah, Ethics Office.
Connie Shayes.

27:02.354 --> 27:03.616
Report him.

27:03.655 --> 27:05.350
- I'll go with you.
- Me, too.

27:05.390 --> 27:06.857
No, I don't want

27:06.891 --> 27:08.358
anybody knowing about this.

27:08.393 --> 27:09.519
It's humiliating.

27:09.561 --> 27:12.121
Val, relax, okay?

27:12.163 --> 27:16.600
Just sit down and I'll get you
a cup of tea or something.

27:16.635 --> 27:18.569
Would you talk to her, please?
Convince her?

27:23.208 --> 27:24.800
Look, Haywood made a pass
at you,

27:24.843 --> 27:26.140
and you turned him down, right?

27:26.177 --> 27:27.405
Yeah.

27:27.445 --> 27:30.039
And now he's using
his power to punish you.

27:30.081 --> 27:32.311
That's sexual harassment,
Valerie.

27:32.350 --> 27:33.681
It's illegal.

27:33.718 --> 27:35.743
Look, there are things about me
that you don't know.

27:35.787 --> 27:37.220
Things that
I'm not really proud of.

27:37.255 --> 27:38.722
Look, that may be, all right?

27:38.757 --> 27:40.418
But if you let him get away
with this, you're an accomplice.

27:40.458 --> 27:42.255
Chances are you're
not the first girl

27:42.293 --> 27:44.420
he did this to,
and you won't be the last.

27:46.131 --> 27:48.099
Thanks.

27:50.535 --> 27:52.969
So, have we made
any headway here?

27:53.004 --> 27:55.302
Okay, I'll report him...

27:57.075 --> 27:59.566
but you may not like me
when this is over.

28:03.581 --> 28:07.312
Professor Haywood
propositioned you for sex?

28:07.352 --> 28:10.685
Yes, and it wasn't subtle.

28:10.722 --> 28:12.622
Did anyone see you together?

28:12.657 --> 28:14.022
No.

28:14.059 --> 28:16.391
But the worst part is just
because I didn't put out,

28:16.428 --> 28:19.124
he gave me a "D"
on my midterm project.

28:19.164 --> 28:22.600
Are you sure that's the reason
for the grade?

28:22.634 --> 28:24.158
Oh, it's a great paper.

28:24.202 --> 28:25.669
I mean, before any
of this happened,

28:25.704 --> 28:27.695
he said it was the best
in his class.

28:27.739 --> 28:29.229
I see.

28:29.274 --> 28:31.708
Look, is there anything
you can do?

28:31.743 --> 28:33.836
Well, it's gonna take some time,

28:33.878 --> 28:36.210
but we will start
an investigation right away.

28:37.382 --> 28:39.247
Now, are you sure
there isn't anybody

28:39.284 --> 28:40.615
who can corroborate
what happened?

28:40.652 --> 28:43.143
No, it was just the two of us.

28:43.188 --> 28:47.147
Why were you alone with him
and off campus?

28:47.192 --> 28:49.285
I knew this was gonna happen.

28:49.327 --> 28:51.921
I'm the one who's gonna be
investigated, aren't I?

28:51.963 --> 28:56.127
Now, look, we will have to talk
to people who know you

28:56.167 --> 28:58.226
as well as people who know him.

28:58.269 --> 29:02.933
Just... just forget
the whole thing.

29:14.652 --> 29:16.244
Claudia, I didn't expect
to see you here.

29:16.287 --> 29:18.084
I could say the same to you.

29:18.123 --> 29:19.647
I just thought I'd stop by

29:19.691 --> 29:21.921
and see if Colin needed a ride
to the gallery.

29:21.993 --> 29:25.019
Well, he's already got one,
but thanks.

29:25.063 --> 29:26.394
Is he here?

29:26.431 --> 29:28.695
He's taking a shower.

29:28.733 --> 29:31.930
You two worked pretty late.

29:34.873 --> 29:36.841
Kelly, you're a smart girl.

29:36.875 --> 29:38.206
Haven't you caught on yet?

29:38.243 --> 29:39.574
I beg your pardon?

29:39.611 --> 29:40.635
Here's the deal.

29:40.678 --> 29:43.613
You can borrow Colin,
but I own him.

29:45.049 --> 29:46.073
What was that?

29:46.117 --> 29:47.277
We have an arrangement.

29:47.318 --> 29:50.082
I fund his art,
and he's available to me...

29:50.121 --> 29:53.284
for whatever I want,
whenever I want.

29:54.325 --> 29:55.314
Claudia?

29:55.360 --> 29:57.351
Grab me a clean towel?

29:57.395 --> 29:58.419
Yes, love.

29:59.931 --> 30:01.296
I thought you were married.

30:02.500 --> 30:05.230
My husband's an older man

30:05.270 --> 30:08.865
with far greater problems
than my marital infidelities.

30:08.907 --> 30:10.465
Do us all a favor...

30:10.508 --> 30:11.998
don't show up tonight.

30:41.506 --> 30:42.996
Donna... Hey.

30:43.041 --> 30:44.099
where's Kelly?

30:44.142 --> 30:45.166
I don't know.

30:45.210 --> 30:46.472
I've been stuck
in Pasadena all day.

30:46.511 --> 30:47.773
Right.
How's that going?

30:47.812 --> 30:50.576
Good, good, I think.
Did you ask Clare about Kelly?

30:50.615 --> 30:51.809
Yeah, she hasn't seen her
either.

30:51.850 --> 30:53.112
Oh, well, don't worry.

30:53.151 --> 30:54.914
I mean, she wouldn't miss this
for the world.

30:54.953 --> 30:58.821
Colin, Dena Morrisey
from the Getty Museum.

30:58.857 --> 31:00.222
Excuse me.

31:00.258 --> 31:01.350
- I gotta mingle.
- Okay.

31:07.232 --> 31:08.290
I love Colin's work.

31:08.333 --> 31:09.960
Isn't this fun?

31:10.068 --> 31:12.400
No, actually,
I'm all kind of arted out.

31:12.437 --> 31:14.837
We've been here,
like, 15 minutes.

31:14.873 --> 31:17.171
So, what's polite, 16?

31:17.208 --> 31:18.971
Why, what's your rush?

31:19.010 --> 31:21.843
Well, I checked out
that hotel room

31:21.880 --> 31:23.211
that you booked for us.

31:23.248 --> 31:25.409
You got a lot of style, Arnold.

31:25.450 --> 31:26.781
I'm glad you liked it.

31:26.818 --> 31:27.842
While I was there,

31:27.886 --> 31:29.854
I personally filled it
with flowers...

31:29.888 --> 31:30.980
heavy on the lilies.

31:31.022 --> 31:32.649
My favorite.

31:32.690 --> 31:34.885
I scoped out
the vast video menu.

31:34.926 --> 31:36.325
We can watch Moo <i>n</i> struck
if you like.

31:36.361 --> 31:38.693
My favorite movie.

31:38.730 --> 31:41.961
We could order some room
service: gazpacho, brownies.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.764
You've done your homework.

31:44.802 --> 31:46.463
I grilled Donna for details.

31:46.504 --> 31:47.835
Well, you got everything right.

31:49.440 --> 31:53.206
By the way, I left
a little surprise

31:53.244 --> 31:55.303
in the room for you.

31:55.346 --> 31:57.314
I think I found it.

31:59.918 --> 32:00.850
Colin, what are you doing?

32:00.885 --> 32:01.943
Calling Kelly.

32:02.020 --> 32:04.955
Forget Kelly.
The L.A. Times is waiting.

32:05.023 --> 32:07.457
She's late, and
I'm worried about her.

32:07.492 --> 32:10.052
Colin, she's not coming.

32:10.094 --> 32:12.858
What?

32:12.897 --> 32:15.229
Kelly and I had a very
illuminating conversation

32:15.266 --> 32:18.394
this afternoon.

32:18.436 --> 32:20.063
- You told her about us?
- You wouldn't.

32:20.104 --> 32:21.731
How much longer did you
expect me to let this go on?

32:21.773 --> 32:24.241
I'm outta here.

32:24.275 --> 32:25.674
The press is here.

32:25.710 --> 32:27.701
You can't leave
your own opening.

32:27.745 --> 32:29.269
Watch me.

32:39.757 --> 32:42.658
I love hotels.

32:42.694 --> 32:48.098
Check into a place like this,
live out all your fantasies.

32:48.132 --> 32:51.761
Mm, these are so beautiful.

32:51.803 --> 32:53.430
What are you looking for?

32:53.471 --> 32:54.802
What are you doing?

32:54.839 --> 32:57.967
I'm just looking for that little
surprise you left me.

32:58.009 --> 33:00.671
Mm, it's not in there.

33:00.712 --> 33:02.339
It's in here.

33:05.283 --> 33:06.773
Professor Chee

33:06.818 --> 33:11.255
called to tell me how pleased
he's been with your progress.

33:11.289 --> 33:12.449
He slipped me

33:12.490 --> 33:14.754
a copy of your latest test.

33:14.792 --> 33:17.090
Congratulations. You got an "A."

33:18.529 --> 33:19.518
I got an "A"?!

33:19.564 --> 33:21.725
What are those?

33:21.766 --> 33:23.563
It's the little surprise
you left me.

33:23.601 --> 33:26.434
This was my surprise.

33:26.471 --> 33:28.701
You brought handcuffs

33:28.740 --> 33:30.207
for our romantic evening?
Are you sick?!

33:30.241 --> 33:31.469
I didn't bring this stuff here.

33:31.509 --> 33:33.670
Admit it, Clare.
You're the one who stashed it!

33:33.711 --> 33:34.939
Yeah, I stashed it

33:34.979 --> 33:37.072
considering there's a police
convention in the hotel.

33:37.115 --> 33:39.982
You think maybe they use
some of this stuff

33:40.051 --> 33:41.143
on their off-duty hours?

33:42.587 --> 33:45.317
You know, I actually thought

33:45.356 --> 33:47.790
we were ready
for a mature relationship.

33:47.825 --> 33:51.386
Obviously, you're...
incapable of that.

33:51.429 --> 33:53.522
Wait a second, before you get

33:53.564 --> 33:54.895
all self-righteous on me,

33:54.932 --> 33:57.366
I happen to know for a fact
that a lot of your past

33:57.402 --> 33:59.393
relationships
involved handcuffs.

33:59.437 --> 34:00.631
Who told you that?

34:00.671 --> 34:03.196
Well, I don't want to mention
any names,

34:03.241 --> 34:04.799
but it makes perfect sense to me

34:04.842 --> 34:07.072
that all this stuff
could have been left by someone

34:07.111 --> 34:08.476
as kinkified as you.

34:08.513 --> 34:10.071
Kinkified? That's it.

34:10.114 --> 34:11.138
I'm outta here.

34:21.391 --> 34:23.087
Come on, Keats.
It's time to go.

34:23.127 --> 34:25.561
You work too hard.

34:25.596 --> 34:26.960
I'm onto something
with this Haywood thing.

34:27.065 --> 34:28.464
There's dirt here.
I can smell it.

34:28.498 --> 34:30.433
I've just got to dig
a little deeper.

34:30.467 --> 34:32.402
Okay, I'll bite.
What've you got?

34:32.437 --> 34:33.870
A list of phone numbers.

34:35.540 --> 34:37.098
A list of phone numbers?
That's nice.

34:37.141 --> 34:38.574
You got a quote from Valerie?

34:38.609 --> 34:41.304
No. She won't go public.

34:41.344 --> 34:43.505
- I've been begging her all day.
- Then stay away from the story.

34:43.547 --> 34:46.244
Brandon, from what
I've got so far,

34:46.284 --> 34:47.945
this thing goes way
beyond Valerie.

35:00.098 --> 35:02.430
I thought you had
something to do tonight?

35:02.467 --> 35:07.404
Let's see, my ex-girlfriend's
new boyfriend's show,

35:07.438 --> 35:08.905
and I have to go stag?

35:08.940 --> 35:10.032
I don't think so.

35:10.074 --> 35:11.371
Give me half your phone list.

35:11.409 --> 35:12.467
You're going to help me?

35:12.510 --> 35:13.909
I just want to see for myself

35:13.945 --> 35:14.934
what you really have.

35:14.979 --> 35:16.970
Be my guest.

35:22.520 --> 35:26.320
No, no, don't turn it off.
It's beautiful.

35:26.357 --> 35:28.348
The gallery opening started
a half hour ago.

35:28.392 --> 35:30.326
We're already late.

35:30.361 --> 35:31.623
That's okay.

35:31.662 --> 35:33.755
I don't feel like
going anyway.

35:33.798 --> 35:36.596
I'm not in the mood
to be charming tonight.

35:36.634 --> 35:40.297
All right, then we'll
just hang out here.

35:41.973 --> 35:43.964
That feels great.

35:44.008 --> 35:45.498
Good. Enjoy it.

35:51.415 --> 35:53.440
Don't go anywhere.

35:57.088 --> 35:58.112
Hello.

35:58.156 --> 35:59.248
David, it's Brandon.

35:59.290 --> 36:01.190
I'm looking for Valerie.
Is she there?

36:01.225 --> 36:03.125
Oh, yeah, she's right here.

36:03.161 --> 36:04.287
It's Brandon.

36:04.328 --> 36:06.728
He's been looking
all over for you.

36:06.764 --> 36:08.061
Hey, Brandon.

36:08.099 --> 36:09.361
Are you at the art gallery?

36:09.400 --> 36:10.765
No, we're still at the newsroom.

36:10.801 --> 36:12.029
Susan asked me to call.

36:12.069 --> 36:13.696
Is this about Haywood?

36:13.738 --> 36:15.035
Yeah.

36:15.072 --> 36:16.061
She's been investigating him.

36:16.107 --> 36:17.734
Look, I know all about it.

36:17.775 --> 36:18.935
I have nothing to say.

36:19.043 --> 36:20.476
Listen Val, I've been
getting into this too

36:20.511 --> 36:22.376
and you may want to reconsider
going on the record because...

36:22.413 --> 36:23.846
Absolutely not.

36:23.881 --> 36:25.109
You know I wish

36:25.149 --> 36:26.946
I'd never told any
of you about this.

36:26.984 --> 36:28.281
Just back off.

36:28.319 --> 36:31.811
Okay, if that's
the way you feel,

36:31.856 --> 36:33.949
but Val, with you
or without you,

36:34.025 --> 36:36.152
there's too much story here
to let this die.

36:36.194 --> 36:39.095
Just don't make me
a part of it, okay?

36:39.130 --> 36:41.394
Okay, you got it.

36:41.432 --> 36:42.865
Thanks, Brandon.

36:42.900 --> 36:44.197
I'll see you later.

36:44.235 --> 36:45.463
Yeah, later.

36:47.471 --> 36:48.665
She said no.

36:48.706 --> 36:49.934
I got that.

36:56.347 --> 36:59.145
I don't understand
why you're backing off.

36:59.183 --> 37:01.549
Because I don't want to be
raked over the coals.

37:01.586 --> 37:03.383
So what? You're tough.

37:03.421 --> 37:06.515
David, do you really
want to hear

37:06.557 --> 37:08.149
what a slut I am?

37:08.192 --> 37:09.921
'Cause that's going
to be Haywood's defense.

37:09.961 --> 37:13.124
Look, Val, I don't care
what anyone says, okay?

37:13.164 --> 37:15.860
I'm gonna stand by you
like you stood by me,

37:15.900 --> 37:17.697
whether you go through
with this or not.

37:19.003 --> 37:20.368
Okay?

37:27.912 --> 37:29.277
Listen, David,

37:29.313 --> 37:31.543
do me a favor.

37:31.582 --> 37:33.049
Anything.

37:33.084 --> 37:35.518
Promise me that you
won't get impatient

37:35.553 --> 37:37.418
if I want to take
this relationship slow.

37:37.455 --> 37:40.117
I promise.

38:02.313 --> 38:03.803
What are you doing here?

38:03.848 --> 38:05.315
Looking for you.

38:05.349 --> 38:09.911
Shouldn't you be kissing up
to art dealers and reviewers,

38:09.987 --> 38:11.545
not to mention Claudia?

38:11.589 --> 38:13.921
I blew it all off.

38:14.025 --> 38:15.856
Probably set my career
back for years.

38:15.893 --> 38:17.918
Impressive.

38:18.029 --> 38:19.018
Good night.

38:19.063 --> 38:20.690
Kelly, please.

38:21.999 --> 38:23.466
There's things you need to hear.

38:23.501 --> 38:25.628
I've heard everything
I need to hear,

38:25.670 --> 38:26.796
all right?

38:26.837 --> 38:28.896
Just get off my property.

38:28.939 --> 38:30.873
Forget my number.
Get out of my life.

38:30.908 --> 38:33.308
Let me explain about Claudia.

38:33.344 --> 38:34.675
What is it? Do you love her?

38:34.712 --> 38:35.940
No.

38:36.047 --> 38:37.844
It was just a deal
for my career.

38:37.882 --> 38:40.043
It was in place
long before I met you.

38:40.084 --> 38:41.711
It's just business.

38:41.752 --> 38:42.946
She means nothing to me.

38:43.020 --> 38:44.385
That is very sad.

38:44.422 --> 38:46.913
Look, I'm going to break it off
with her for good.

38:46.957 --> 38:48.117
And then what?

38:48.159 --> 38:50.787
Find a West Coast version
of Claudia?

38:50.828 --> 38:51.954
Who's going to be

38:51.996 --> 38:53.190
your sugar mama then?

38:53.230 --> 38:54.720
Who's going to pay
for your loft?

38:54.765 --> 38:56.892
I'll get a job.

38:56.934 --> 38:58.959
I'll believe that when I see it.

38:59.036 --> 39:02.233
Try to understand, Kelly.

39:02.273 --> 39:05.106
It's the price I had to pay
to concentrate on my art.

39:05.142 --> 39:07.133
You're not an artist.

39:07.178 --> 39:08.304
You're a whore.

39:08.346 --> 39:10.507
And I would have more respect
for you

39:10.548 --> 39:11.742
if you were sweeping floors.

40:03.601 --> 40:04.693
Professor Haywood?

40:04.735 --> 40:06.896
What do you want?

40:06.937 --> 40:09.405
To make peace.

40:09.440 --> 40:11.965
I was hoping that we could come
to a private understanding

40:12.009 --> 40:14.136
about what happened,

40:14.178 --> 40:16.476
and you'd reconsider giving me
the grade I deserve.

40:16.514 --> 40:17.947
Private?

40:17.982 --> 40:20.678
I don't think reporting me
to the Ethics Office

40:20.718 --> 40:22.345
qualifies as private, do you?

40:22.386 --> 40:24.183
- They called you?
- No. I got a call

40:24.221 --> 40:26.155
from the Co <i>n</i> dor editor.

40:26.190 --> 40:28.954
She's already working
on an article all about me.

40:28.993 --> 40:33.453
But know this: you're the one
who's going to suffer.

40:33.497 --> 40:36.591
I didn't do anything.

40:36.634 --> 40:39.000
Well, I welcome a hearing.

40:40.037 --> 40:42.198
I want people to hear
every detail

40:42.239 --> 40:44.833
about the skimpy little outfits
you wear to class.

40:44.875 --> 40:46.672
And the way you flirt with me,

40:46.710 --> 40:48.541
suggesting
what you might do for me

40:48.579 --> 40:50.171
if I give you the right grade.

40:50.214 --> 40:51.545
You came on to me, Professor.

40:51.582 --> 40:54.483
Says the little strumpet.

40:54.518 --> 40:56.645
Believe me,

40:56.687 --> 40:59.554
you are going to be humiliated.

41:09.166 --> 41:11.100
That's right, Dean Whitmore,
We think so. too.

41:11.135 --> 41:12.500
And I'm glad we agree.

41:12.536 --> 41:14.470
Well, you're welcome to come
over and discuss it...

41:14.505 --> 41:16.598
Valerie, oh, God, I've been
looking all over for you.

41:16.640 --> 41:18.938
- Susan called Haywood. - I know.
I just came from his office.

41:18.976 --> 41:20.466
But I didn't mention your name.

41:20.511 --> 41:22.979
Listen, I don't care anymore.
I just want to get this guy.

41:23.013 --> 41:24.446
Get your tape recorder out.

41:24.482 --> 41:26.814
I'm talking, whether anybody
believes me or not.

41:26.851 --> 41:27.977
Something tells me they will.

41:28.085 --> 41:29.279
Why's that?

41:29.320 --> 41:31.254
Because we've been on
the phone all night,

41:31.288 --> 41:32.414
digging into this story.

41:32.456 --> 41:33.923
And at about 1:00 a.m.,

41:33.958 --> 41:36.119
a whole lot of people
came out of the woodwork.

41:36.160 --> 41:38.720
Come in and see for yourself.

41:46.670 --> 41:49.764
All these women are former
students of Haywood's.

41:49.807 --> 41:51.434
He tried the same thing on them.

41:51.475 --> 41:52.669
Everybody, this is
Valerie Malone.

41:52.710 --> 41:54.371
She's the one
who got this ball rolling.

41:54.411 --> 41:56.675
Good for you.

41:57.982 --> 42:00.849
Did he say that you reminded
him of his late wife?

42:00.885 --> 42:02.409
He said that to you, too?

42:02.453 --> 42:04.114
He said that to all of us.

42:04.154 --> 42:05.348
And now we're going on record.

42:05.389 --> 42:07.380
Connie Shayes is on her way down

42:07.424 --> 42:08.823
to take statements
from everybody.

42:08.859 --> 42:10.486
And I just got off the phone

42:10.528 --> 42:11.859
with Dean Whitmore.

42:11.896 --> 42:13.921
The university has had it
with Professor Haywood.

42:13.964 --> 42:14.953
They're going to demand

42:15.032 --> 42:16.260
for his resignation today.

42:16.300 --> 42:18.097
So by the time this story
is published tomorrow,

42:18.135 --> 42:19.625
it's going to have
a happy ending.

42:19.670 --> 42:20.830
You guys are amazing.

42:21.972 --> 42:24.338
Power of the press.

42:52.069 --> 42:54.731
I hope you're not crying
about yesterday.

42:54.772 --> 42:57.502
No, I'm not.

42:57.541 --> 43:01.307
It's today I'm worried about.

43:01.345 --> 43:03.575
And the next day,
and the next day.

43:06.617 --> 43:09.916
I'm scared, Dylan.

43:09.954 --> 43:15.153
I have the most empty
feeling inside of me.

43:17.061 --> 43:20.428
Nothing's ever gonna
be the same, is it?

43:20.464 --> 43:22.955
Probably not.

43:26.971 --> 43:29.269
As long as I have you,
I don't care.

43:30.708 --> 43:32.835
Well, I promise

43:32.876 --> 43:35.470
that I will never let
anyone or anything

43:35.512 --> 43:38.709
hurt you as long as I live.
