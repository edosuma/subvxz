19:06.023 --> 19:07.232
Shit.

19:08.025 --> 19:10.611
- I gotta go.
- I didn 't tell you yet.

19:10.778 --> 19:12.196
- What?
- Jackie.

19:12.363 --> 19:16.241
He was doing a deal
with some black dudes. They shot him.

19:17.117 --> 19:19.078
He's, like, dead.

19:29.254 --> 19:32.132
22 years old,
living in a housing project.

19:32.883 --> 19:35.386
Imagine the shame for the family.

19:40.724 --> 19:44.853
Fortunately, they were no longer
boyfriend and girlfriend.

19:45.104 --> 19:48.107
- How's your daughter taking it?
- Not well.

19:49.108 --> 19:53.278
You certainly saw it coming
with this boy, didn't you?

19:55.489 --> 19:58.200
In the end, I failed him.

19:59.410 --> 20:02.454
What the fuck you gonna do?
World today...

20:05.290 --> 20:08.961
One thing. I won't make
the same mistake with A.J.

20:09.336 --> 20:13.090
He got expelled.
Him we're sending to military school.

20:13.257 --> 20:17.344
We never discussed exactly
what you want for your children.

20:17.761 --> 20:20.347
I don't want their faces blown off.

20:20.514 --> 20:23.058
You went into your father's business.

20:23.267 --> 20:25.144
I didn't have a choice.

20:25.310 --> 20:28.272
I try to give my kids
every opportunity.

20:28.439 --> 20:31.984
Meadow's going to Columbia,
for chrissakes.

20:32.151 --> 20:36.155
Wants to be some kind
of a professional woman.

20:36.822 --> 20:39.158
- Like you.
- A psychiatrist?

20:39.324 --> 20:42.786
And have to listen to guys like me
whine all day?

20:44.955 --> 20:47.666
She mentioned being
a pediatrician once.

20:48.000 --> 20:51.670
- You'd like that?
- I would like something like that.

20:51.837 --> 20:55.466
But the important thing
is she get far away from me.

20:58.343 --> 21:00.846
I mean, she could live close.

21:01.013 --> 21:03.432
I think I understand.

21:03.599 --> 21:06.310
- And your son?
- A.J.?

21:08.437 --> 21:11.148
In my business? Forget it.

21:12.357 --> 21:14.568
He'd never make it.

21:18.739 --> 21:23.035
Your father and I have to drive A.J.
up to Hudson Institute.

21:23.202 --> 21:25.704
I'd feel much better if you were up.

21:25.996 --> 21:30.125
Jackie's dead, and you perseverate
on secondary schools?

21:33.503 --> 21:36.590
I was up half the night with Ro.

21:37.132 --> 21:41.970
This morning her sister and I made
all the funeral arrangements.

21:42.179 --> 21:44.264
A.J. doesn't have a school.

21:44.431 --> 21:49.394
He can't chat all day on the Web
with the other dropouts and flakes.

21:53.857 --> 22:00.238
You know, he's the first person
my own age that I knew that ever died.

22:04.242 --> 22:07.496
Well, he knew all the risks involved.

22:07.663 --> 22:09.623
What, the X?

22:10.207 --> 22:14.211
Half the kids I know take it.
They get it from someone.

22:14.378 --> 22:18.048
- It's not a thing you get killed over.
- Except he did.

22:18.340 --> 22:20.258
- Or not.
- Meaning?

22:21.635 --> 22:24.221
Look at who he grew up with.

22:24.388 --> 22:27.975
Look at who his father was.
Look at everyone we know.

22:28.141 --> 22:33.188
- Let's not get cute.
- When I'm being cute, I'll tell you.

22:39.528 --> 22:43.365
You liked Jackie, so you won't
believe it was his fault.

22:43.532 --> 22:48.495
So, like others, you look for bogeymen
with Italian names to blame.

22:48.662 --> 22:53.750
So whatever you're thinking, stop,
because that is not what happened.

22:56.670 --> 23:00.882
TROOP LEADER:
Left, left, left right left.

23:01.049 --> 23:04.594
Left, left, left right left.

23:04.803 --> 23:08.807
- Stealing an exam is a personal defeat.
- It was wrong.

23:09.015 --> 23:11.393
That sounds pre-programmed.

23:11.560 --> 23:15.105
Is that how you saw your future self?
A cheat?

23:15.272 --> 23:18.525
- No.
- How do you explain it?

23:19.901 --> 23:24.281
There's, like, academic pressure.
About getting into college.

23:24.448 --> 23:25.907
They're obsessed.

23:26.074 --> 23:30.287
With "like, academic pressure"?
Or academic pressure?

23:30.454 --> 23:33.415
There's all this pressure.
My parents too.

23:33.665 --> 23:37.419
My sister goes to Columbia
and my parents expect me to go.

23:37.586 --> 23:41.298
That's "stinking thinking."
Like with an alcoholic.

23:41.465 --> 23:45.177
- No one makes him drink.
- I'm not an alcoholic.

23:45.427 --> 23:49.556
How do we do things differently
than at your former school?

23:49.723 --> 23:52.100
- I don't know.
- I realize that.

23:52.267 --> 23:53.852
I'm about to tell you.

23:54.019 --> 23:57.814
At your school, and it's not
a bad one, you're right...

23:57.981 --> 24:02.527
...there's too much emphasis
on what's good for you, John and Jane.

24:02.694 --> 24:07.574
Here, the higher good is of the Corps.
As Gen. MacArthur said:

24:07.866 --> 24:10.911
"The Corps, the Corps, the Corps."

24:12.037 --> 24:16.333
Now, how do we achieve this
revolution in thinking on your part?

24:17.667 --> 24:20.837
Cadet Corps has first call
0530 each day...

24:21.004 --> 24:23.882
...march to first mess 0620...

24:24.049 --> 24:28.011
...dorm inspection 0700,
classes 0800 to 1440.

24:28.178 --> 24:33.308
Athletic formation 1500,
except Thursdays, which is drill.

24:33.475 --> 24:38.688
1900 to 2100 is evening study time.
Taps, lights out 2200.

24:38.855 --> 24:41.858
What's missing? Give up?
Television.

24:45.779 --> 24:48.490
- What's "0530" mean?
- 5:30 a.m.

24:50.742 --> 24:53.912
I outlined a blueprint
for self-discipline...

24:54.079 --> 24:58.792
...that would take you through
your life, and that's your question?

25:00.961 --> 25:07.175
Why do guys in the Army, or spies,
use that "0" thing when they tell time?

25:08.051 --> 25:10.512
That'll be made abundantly clear.

25:10.679 --> 25:14.015
For now, we have an expression:
Keep it simple.

25:17.769 --> 25:19.396
ZWINGLl:
Captain Delaunay?

25:20.146 --> 25:23.733
Give Mr. Soprano the T.O.I.
while I meet his parents.

25:23.900 --> 25:25.610
Sir, yes, sir.

25:43.753 --> 25:47.590
I think Anthony could greatly
benefit from our program...

25:47.757 --> 25:51.386
...which, as I candidly told him,
is very rigorous.

25:51.970 --> 25:53.722
Do you mind?

25:55.515 --> 26:01.312
I'll be very frank with you. I do not
agree with this hard-nosed discipline.

26:01.479 --> 26:03.898
The mothers seldom do.

26:06.484 --> 26:09.571
Wait till he starts
opening doors for you.

26:09.738 --> 26:12.782
Now, that would be a miracle.

26:13.074 --> 26:15.952
What about creativity?
Independent thought?

26:16.119 --> 26:19.831
I stressed heavily
notions of duty and groupthink.

26:19.998 --> 26:25.044
But I didn't mention the Army's motto
of today: Be an Army of One.

26:25.211 --> 26:28.506
Why be an army at all?
How about a veterinarian?

26:28.673 --> 26:30.467
Isn't there enough war?

26:30.633 --> 26:35.680
- Amputees? Horrible displaced...
- He's just gonna march a little bit.

26:35.889 --> 26:39.350
Don't get hung up on marching.
It's part of it...

26:39.517 --> 26:45.857
...but it's nothing compared to
the mentoring and faculty involvement.

26:46.024 --> 26:48.067
Well, that sounds wonderful.

26:48.234 --> 26:52.363
We've created too many options
for our kids. They're confused.

26:52.530 --> 26:59.078
When things go wrong, we fob them off
onto the substance-recovery industry.

27:00.580 --> 27:05.418
This "army of one" thing. What happens
when each army of one decides:

27:05.585 --> 27:08.296
"Fuck it, I won't go
over the foxhole"?

27:08.463 --> 27:12.467
Or, "Let's shoot the lieutenant"?
Because they been told...

27:12.634 --> 27:15.678
...you know,
"You're an army of one."

27:15.845 --> 27:18.139
Audie Murphy was an army of one.

27:18.306 --> 27:21.142
We're preparing him
for a military career?

27:21.309 --> 27:22.644
No. No.

27:23.603 --> 27:25.021
One day at a time.

27:25.188 --> 27:30.068
- You want to train him to be a killer?
- Will you stop? They're soldiers.

27:30.235 --> 27:34.822
- The Army hardly ever goes to war!
- They were marching with rifles!

27:34.989 --> 27:38.576
- They're symbolic!
- Symbolic of what?

27:38.743 --> 27:40.370
Respect!

27:41.204 --> 27:45.750
He will be disciplined by kids
hardly older than himself.

27:46.000 --> 27:49.337
Boys his age still kill frogs
and small animals.

27:49.545 --> 27:54.008
The Cusamanos' Binky? The bomb
with nails, you think it was A.J.?

27:54.175 --> 27:56.594
No. That's what I am trying to say!

27:56.761 --> 27:59.681
He is still a child!
He's a normal child!

27:59.847 --> 28:03.601
He's made mistakes
and he's got a shitload to learn.

28:03.893 --> 28:07.563
That doesn't mean I'll let
you send him to a school...

28:07.730 --> 28:10.942
...that scares him
into following orders!

28:11.401 --> 28:17.073
- He thinks the world owes him a living!
- What could have given him that idea?

28:18.741 --> 28:23.162
We tried it your way for 15 years.
Validating his feelings.

28:23.329 --> 28:28.334
That school did the same! He thinks
the world runs on his feelings!

28:28.543 --> 28:34.007
- He's gonna go learn to be a man!
- I will not send him to that place!

28:34.841 --> 28:37.343
Oh, no, fuck that! Allow me!
