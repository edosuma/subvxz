NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

00:03.235 --> 00:06.899
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous,

00:06.973 --> 00:08.064
In New York City,

00:08.141 --> 00:11.110
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:11.177 --> 00:14.704
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit,

00:14.781 --> 00:16.681
These are their stories,

01:15.308 --> 01:17.299
FIN: Sodomized and murdered,
no ID.

01:17.377 --> 01:20.346
Who found her?
Parish priest,
Father Michael Sweeney.

01:20.413 --> 01:22.973
Came in at 5:30 this morning,
and there she was.

01:23.049 --> 01:24.710
PIus a whole Iot of
other weirdness.

01:25.218 --> 01:26.378
STABLER: Yeah? Like what?

01:26.453 --> 01:28.250
FIN: For starters,
he torched the confessionals,

01:28.321 --> 01:31.017
then he Iaid out the vic
Iike some Iittle princess.

01:31.091 --> 01:32.922
Entry was made
through the side door.

01:32.992 --> 01:36.291
Father Michael says
he Ieaves it unlocked
sometimes.

(POLICE RADIO CHATTERING)

01:41.634 --> 01:45.263
FIN: The fire pretty much
burned itself out
by the time he arrived.

01:45.338 --> 01:47.568
BENSON: No smoke alarms?
Church doesn't have
to have them.

01:47.640 --> 01:49.835
Luckily it's built
out of stone.

01:49.909 --> 01:52.036
Purse and panties
are gone.

01:53.012 --> 01:55.242
But the stem's still
on the apple.

01:55.315 --> 01:58.011
A trannie?
Our Jane Doe's a John.

01:59.319 --> 02:00.616
BENSON: Painted up Iike a pro.

02:00.687 --> 02:03.952
And dressed Iike this,
he wasn't out collecting
for the Red Cross.

02:04.023 --> 02:06.048
STABLER: Did you guys
check this out?

02:07.494 --> 02:09.291
Looks Iike the perp
Ieft us a message.

02:10.163 --> 02:11.152
Peccavisti.

02:11.898 --> 02:15.561
Lot of ritual here.
Could be the work of a
highly-evolved serial killer.

02:15.635 --> 02:17.330
BENSON: We should run this
through VICAP.

02:17.403 --> 02:21.237
Excuse me, Father.
Detective Stabler,
Special Victims Unit.

02:22.575 --> 02:24.065
My Latin never got much past

02:24.144 --> 02:25.975
amo, amas, amat,
Maybe you can help me
with this.

02:26.045 --> 02:28.343
Does that mean
"I have sinned?"

02:29.782 --> 02:31.875
Did you know this boy,
Father?

02:33.052 --> 02:34.883
I had never saw him before.

02:35.355 --> 02:37.346
Father, we're gonna need you
to come down to the precinct

02:37.423 --> 02:40.153
and make a statement for us.
Of course.

02:42.128 --> 02:43.652
So the perp
meets the victim.

02:43.730 --> 02:46.824
Maybe he knows
he's a transvestite,
maybe not.

02:47.300 --> 02:50.360
Well, if he didn't,
that'd definitely be enough
to set him off.

02:50.436 --> 02:54.930
They come in here to trick,
perp sodomizes him
and kills him,

02:55.842 --> 02:58.811
decorates his body,
then gives him a funeral pyre.

02:58.878 --> 03:01.438
Why go to all the trouble
and then try to cover it up?

03:01.514 --> 03:04.677
He's in a church,
he feels guilty.

03:05.552 --> 03:09.454
He tells God he's sorry
and then he tries
to burn away the sin.

03:57.670 --> 04:02.198
Bruising to the thighs, small
anal tears, but the attack
wasn't particularly violent.

04:02.976 --> 04:06.537
Cause of death,
massive hemorrhage
from a skull fracture.

04:07.213 --> 04:08.976
Any ideas
about the murder weapon?

04:09.048 --> 04:10.447
WARNER: BIunt trauma
to the temple

04:10.516 --> 04:14.782
caused by something round
and heavy Iike an iron bar
or flashlight.

04:15.021 --> 04:17.853
But the fracture pattern
on the occiput is diffused.

04:17.923 --> 04:20.084
He cracked his head
on the floor
when he fell back?

04:20.159 --> 04:22.753
WARNER: Probably.
You got anything on our perp?

04:22.829 --> 04:26.788
He didn't practice safe rape.
We got fluids.
We're running his DNA.

04:27.700 --> 04:29.725
Any chance of getting prints
off the body?

04:29.802 --> 04:33.829
He was wearing
surgical gloves. We found
traces of Iatex and powder.

04:33.906 --> 04:35.874
No condom,
but he was wearing gloves?

04:35.942 --> 04:38.103
You think that's weird,

04:38.177 --> 04:41.943
I found traces of
sodium dichlorotriazinetrione
inside him.

04:42.649 --> 04:45.379
It's the main cleaning agent
in scouring powder.

04:45.451 --> 04:49.114
And this,
small fragments of steel wool.

04:49.188 --> 04:52.055
Our perp used both
to scrub his penis.

04:52.125 --> 04:55.356
So he's really clean.
And really dirty.

04:57.130 --> 05:00.122
I found the body
when I came down to prepare
for 6:00 mass.

05:00.199 --> 05:01.496
That's early.

05:01.567 --> 05:05.003
There's nothing Iike
a hit of God before you
do battle on Wall Street.

05:05.071 --> 05:08.234
Still, it seems Iike
a pretty rough area to Ieave
the side door unlocked.

05:08.308 --> 05:11.038
Well, the church is supposed
to be a refuge.

05:11.110 --> 05:13.601
This morning I asked
if you knew the victim.

05:13.680 --> 05:15.113
You didn't seem surprised
he was a boy.

05:15.181 --> 05:19.117
Well, when you serve
in this part of town,
you see almost everything.

05:19.185 --> 05:21.585
So you never saw him before?
No.

05:22.288 --> 05:25.587
But there is someone
in the trenches
who might have.

05:28.828 --> 05:30.796
FIN: We're thinking
maybe he crossed your path.

05:30.863 --> 05:33.696
PEG: Oh, dear Lord. Jamie.

05:33.766 --> 05:35.757
He's dead?
You know him?

05:37.136 --> 05:40.628
James Doyle, 16 years old,
called himself Jamie.

05:41.140 --> 05:44.906
Ran away from home when
his folks tried to Iock him up
in a treatment center.

05:44.977 --> 05:48.538
How Iong has he been
coming down here?
Four, five months.

05:48.614 --> 05:51.845
Trying to earn enough
for a sex change.
Trannies make good money.

05:51.918 --> 05:54.182
Any reason why you think
he'd end up at Saint Martha's?

05:54.253 --> 05:55.743
That's where he died?

05:55.822 --> 05:58.814
He went in there
to do business. Priest Ieft
the side door open.

05:58.891 --> 06:02.418
Father Michael always Ieaves
the church open for the pros
when it's cold and wet.

06:02.495 --> 06:04.122
But they know
not to do business there.

06:04.197 --> 06:08.600
What's this
Father Michael Iike?
He's a good priest
and a good man.

06:10.303 --> 06:13.431
Anything else you can tell me
about who did this
so I can warn folk?

06:13.506 --> 06:17.272
Yeah. He's very particular
about his personal hygiene.

06:17.343 --> 06:19.607
(SNICKERING)
He should stand out a mile.

06:20.913 --> 06:24.440
VICAP can't find
any direct matches
for the M.O. or signature.

06:24.517 --> 06:26.849
Just a partial out in EI Paso,

06:26.919 --> 06:29.353
man murdered his wife,
Ieft her body in the church.

06:29.422 --> 06:31.583
Don't tell me,
where they were married.
Yep.

06:31.657 --> 06:34.854
And now he's sitting
on death row
so he's not much good to us.

06:34.927 --> 06:36.019
You know, maybe
this is the first time

06:36.095 --> 06:39.394
the place didn't burn
and the body's been preserved.

06:39.499 --> 06:42.024
No one's actually ever seen
these Iittle rituals.

06:42.101 --> 06:45.502
I'II ask VICAP
to widen the search
to all arson-related deaths

06:45.571 --> 06:48.096
and cross-check with crimes
against transsexuals
and transvestites.

06:48.174 --> 06:50.802
Warner got a DNA match.
One Mr. Gus Yoder.

06:50.877 --> 06:54.779
Just paroled from Attica.
Did four years for guess what?
Arson.

07:05.224 --> 07:06.691
What is this?
Gus Yoder?

07:06.759 --> 07:08.056
What do you want?

07:08.127 --> 07:10.220
The skinny
on your relationship
with Jamie Doyle.

07:10.296 --> 07:11.524
I don't know no Jamie Doyle.

07:11.597 --> 07:15.431
You always wear those gloves?
Customers don't Iike prints
on the glass.

07:15.501 --> 07:16.695
Tell us about it
at the precinct.

07:16.769 --> 07:21.331
PIease. Don't touch me.
I'II go where you want,
but don't touch me.

07:21.407 --> 07:25.571
Looks Iike we got us a racist.
I'm a Jew.
Is that better or worse?

07:26.712 --> 07:30.011
Haven't you heard of safe sex,
Mr. Yoder?
Of course I have.

07:30.082 --> 07:32.846
Then why'd you Ieave millions
of Iittle Yoders
inside of Jamie Doyle?

07:32.919 --> 07:36.184
We got a DNA match, Gus.
We know you were with him.

07:36.489 --> 07:39.356
I didn't touch him.
Sodomy doesn't count
as touching?

07:39.425 --> 07:40.790
I didn't do that.

07:40.860 --> 07:42.885
Come on. You thought
Jamie was a cute Iittle trick

07:42.962 --> 07:44.395
till he showed you
his surprise package.

07:44.464 --> 07:46.523
And that pissed you off
and you cracked his skull.

07:46.599 --> 07:48.829
Or maybe you Iike Iittle boys,
as Iong as they
Iook Iike girls.

07:48.901 --> 07:51.028
GUS: No.
Sit down, Gus,
you're making me nervous.

07:51.103 --> 07:52.627
I'm not sitting there,
it's disgusting.

07:52.705 --> 07:54.696
It's a chair.
It's filthy.

07:54.774 --> 07:57.572
Think of all the scum
that have sat there.
Yeah, you for one.

07:57.643 --> 08:01.909
I can't breathe in here.
I wanna go home.
Not till we're finished.

08:02.014 --> 08:04.141
We're searching your place,
Gus.

08:04.217 --> 08:07.152
Is that where we're gonna
find Jamie Doyle's purse,
maybe his panties?

08:07.220 --> 08:10.087
AII right. So I picked him up.
I had sex with him.

08:10.156 --> 08:12.784
But he was alive
when he got out of my car.

08:18.798 --> 08:21.699
He tightens his sphincter
any more,
he's gonna implode.

08:21.767 --> 08:25.635
OCD. He probably
washes his hands
about 50 times a day.

08:25.705 --> 08:28.333
Let me have a Iook
at the crime scene.

08:29.108 --> 08:30.234
HUANG: What's this?

08:30.309 --> 08:32.174
BENSON: It's a rosary.
His?

08:32.245 --> 08:34.873
Priest said it came from
one of the statues
in the church.

08:34.947 --> 08:37.414
And it's right
around his neck,
not just placed there?

08:37.482 --> 08:40.418
It's right around. Why?
It's not Yoder.

08:40.986 --> 08:43.649
There's no way
that he'd go near a dead body
or touch blood.

08:43.722 --> 08:46.123
The guy has unprotected sex
with a male prostitute.

08:46.192 --> 08:48.285
You can't tell me
he's squeamish.
He is.

08:48.361 --> 08:51.353
After he has sex,
he wants to get as far away
from his partner as possible.

08:51.430 --> 08:53.921
Or he feels dirty
and he kills him.

08:55.568 --> 08:58.662
What's this?
That's Latin for
"I have sinned"'

09:00.306 --> 09:02.604
I checked it with the priest.
Well, he's wrong.

09:02.675 --> 09:06.873
"I have sinned" is Peccavi,
Peccavisti is
"You have sinned"'

09:06.946 --> 09:10.211
This isn't a confession,
it's an accusation.
Against the victim?

09:10.283 --> 09:12.148
Burning the confessional,
carving "You have sinned,"

09:12.218 --> 09:14.846
seem more Iike acts of rage
against the Church
and the priest.

09:14.921 --> 09:18.516
So Jamie's death is what,
an accident?
It could be.

09:18.591 --> 09:21.583
The altar cloth, the candles,
the rosary beads,

09:21.661 --> 09:22.787
you can't say
they're accidental.

09:22.862 --> 09:27.322
But they were all done
post mortem.
The kill itself is accidental.

09:27.400 --> 09:28.799
Yes, our man killed Jamie,

09:28.868 --> 09:31.894
but the ritualistic elements
seem Iike acts of contrition.

09:31.971 --> 09:36.567
So he was attacking
the priest, and Jamie just
happened to get in the way.

09:36.642 --> 09:39.907
And if the killer had a grudge
against the priest,

09:39.979 --> 09:42.743
there's a good chance
that Father Michael knows him.

09:42.815 --> 09:46.979
Check the Father's background,
see if he's been keeping
bad company.

09:47.486 --> 09:48.714
Yes, I'm still on hold.

09:48.788 --> 09:50.779
Okay. Thank you for that.

09:51.324 --> 09:55.158
That was the secretary from
Saint Thomas's Catholic School
in Hoboken.

09:55.227 --> 09:57.388
Father Michael
used to teach there.

09:57.463 --> 10:00.864
October 1996 he Ieft abruptly,
right in the middle of a term.

10:00.933 --> 10:01.991
What was the reason given?

10:02.068 --> 10:04.730
She says she doesn't know
for sure, but according
to the rumor mill,

10:04.804 --> 10:06.829
a priest abused some boys,
he was then removed.

10:06.906 --> 10:07.998
And the case
never came to trial.

10:08.074 --> 10:10.508
Far as she's heard
it was never even reported.

10:10.576 --> 10:13.044
I'II get Munch and Fin
to check
with the Hoboken cops.

10:13.112 --> 10:14.374
You two talk to Father Michael

10:14.447 --> 10:17.575
before the Church
gets wind of this
and removes him again.

10:17.650 --> 10:19.242
EIIiot.
Not a problem, Captain.

10:19.318 --> 10:22.549
Well, if it becomes one,
you can take a back seat.

10:24.857 --> 10:28.452
You know, I try to be
a good Catholic, raise my kids
as good Catholics.

10:28.527 --> 10:30.757
Something Iike this
shakes your faith. I know.

10:30.830 --> 10:34.425
If I didn't see
through this guy,
how could a 14-year-old?

10:35.267 --> 10:37.394
How could an eight-year-old?

10:48.948 --> 10:50.108
Hello, Detectives.

10:50.182 --> 10:52.878
We need to ask you
some more questions, Father.

10:53.319 --> 10:54.843
AII right.

10:54.920 --> 10:57.480
I'd Iike to know
why you Iied to me.

10:59.091 --> 11:01.457
About what?
The message
on the confessional.

11:01.527 --> 11:04.462
The correct translation is
"You have sinned"'

11:06.966 --> 11:10.834
Well, I'm very sorry.
I was never very good
at Latin.

11:11.604 --> 11:14.903
Or maybe you're the sinner.
Well, who isn't, Detective?

11:14.974 --> 11:16.965
BENSON:
Where were you Iast night?

11:18.744 --> 11:20.837
I was with a parishioner.

11:20.913 --> 11:23.848
I was helping him
through a midnight crisis.

11:23.916 --> 11:25.440
Give us a name.

11:26.986 --> 11:28.578
I can't.
BENSON: Why?

11:28.654 --> 11:33.148
Because he confessed
to the murder?
You know better than
to ask me that.

11:33.759 --> 11:37.525
STABLER:
Saint Thomas's School,
October '96.

11:37.596 --> 11:41.157
There are rumors that a priest
sexually abused some boys.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.134
Was it you?

11:47.973 --> 11:52.069
Tell us what happened
or we'II just get it
from the Hoboken police.

11:52.511 --> 11:54.604
I signed
a confidentiality agreement.

11:54.680 --> 11:56.045
What planet
you been Iiving on, Father?

11:56.115 --> 11:58.879
Confidentiality agreements
won't hold up
in a criminal court.

11:58.951 --> 12:00.350
Evening mass starts
in 20 minutes.

12:00.419 --> 12:02.444
If you're going to charge me
with something, charge me.

12:02.521 --> 12:04.489
Otherwise, please Ieave.

12:11.130 --> 12:12.859
Saint Thomas's School?

12:12.932 --> 12:15.025
That's one I'd rather forget.
Why?

12:15.101 --> 12:18.070
(TV CHATTERING)
The case never went anywhere.
Nobody wanted it to.

12:18.137 --> 12:19.365
Sit. Sit.

12:20.473 --> 12:22.737
So, how'd you catch it?
Somebody make a complaint?

12:22.808 --> 12:25.106
Oh, not at the school,
the ER.

12:25.678 --> 12:27.270
Kid falls off his bike,

12:27.346 --> 12:31.112
doctor finds something else,
bruising around his backside.

12:31.617 --> 12:34.950
I check out the parents.
They're clean.
Yeah, and?

12:35.020 --> 12:38.512
Well, the kid's a student
at Saint Tom's.
I dig a Iittle deeper.

12:38.591 --> 12:40.786
I find four boys
who say they were molested.

12:40.860 --> 12:43.852
By the same priest?
Well, the stories varied.

12:43.929 --> 12:47.194
Kids didn't want
to give names.
MUNCH: What, they were scared?

12:47.266 --> 12:51.225
Maybe, because
just as I was getting close,
the Church steps in,

12:51.303 --> 12:54.602
settles with the families
for 200 grand each.

12:54.673 --> 12:57.403
Why didn't you push harder?
Try to convince the families?

12:57.476 --> 12:58.807
You don't think I tried?

12:58.878 --> 13:02.143
No case,
no complaining witnesses,
what could I do?

13:04.183 --> 13:07.346
Moresco took a Iot of notes,
but never filed a report.

13:07.419 --> 13:09.717
That was the alumni office
at Saint Tom's.

13:09.789 --> 13:13.316
One of the boys moved
to Europe, two of them
are still in the area.

13:13.392 --> 13:15.587
Todd Ramsay
on the Upper West Side

13:15.661 --> 13:19.119
and Ben Campion
works three blocks
from Father Michael's church.

13:19.198 --> 13:21.598
Well, you'd think
he'd try to be as far away
from him as possible.

13:21.667 --> 13:23.396
Let's take him.

13:23.469 --> 13:25.096
We'II take Ramsay.
What about the fourth kid?

13:25.171 --> 13:26.763
Yeah. Bobby Douglas.
Don't know.

13:26.839 --> 13:31.173
AIumni office said
that he severed all ties
as soon as he Ieft the school.

13:34.547 --> 13:37.141
Monday night I was here.
I got an apartment
on the top floor.

13:37.216 --> 13:40.652
Were you alone?
Just me and my TV.
What's this about?

13:40.719 --> 13:44.485
We wanted to ask you
about Saint Tom's,
October '96.

13:46.592 --> 13:50.153
We heard you made allegations
against one of the priests.

13:50.796 --> 13:52.024
I've put that behind me.

13:52.097 --> 13:54.088
But you've remained close
with Father Michael.

13:54.166 --> 13:55.724
He was at Saint Tom's, right?
Yeah.

13:55.801 --> 13:58.133
Father Mike invited me
to run this place
after college.

13:58.204 --> 14:01.605
That was kind of him.
That's how he is.
He Iikes to help people.

14:01.674 --> 14:04.268
He set this place up
to get the kids
off the street, you know.

14:04.343 --> 14:07.244
Did Father Michael abuse you
at Saint Tom's?

14:08.347 --> 14:11.009
No way. No.
He never touched me.

14:11.917 --> 14:13.612
And how is he
with the kids here now?

14:13.686 --> 14:15.551
He doesn't
come around here much anymore.

14:15.621 --> 14:17.589
For the past year
I've pretty much
run the place.

14:17.656 --> 14:20.090
But if there ever is a problem
with a kid, he's always there.

14:20.159 --> 14:22.889
STABLER: For what?
Not for what you're thinking.

14:22.962 --> 14:24.361
Excuse me.

14:26.398 --> 14:29.424
I'm not going to be part
of your witch hunt.

14:29.501 --> 14:31.469
Come on, guys. Let's go!

14:32.004 --> 14:34.495
MUNCH: Mr. Ramsay?
Who are you?

14:34.740 --> 14:37.766
Detectives Munch and Tutuola,
Special Victims.

14:37.843 --> 14:40.778
How can I help you?
Do you know
Father Michael Sweeney?

14:40.846 --> 14:41.835
I knew him at school.

14:41.914 --> 14:45.406
Not since then?
No, and I'm not
saying anything else.

14:45.484 --> 14:46.917
Why not?

14:46.986 --> 14:50.149
Confidentiality agreement.
They paid, I shut up.

14:50.890 --> 14:53.324
It doesn't have to end there.
Forget it.

14:53.392 --> 14:55.155
So a pervy priest put his hand
on my ass...

14:55.227 --> 14:57.320
Todd!
...I'm not gonna Iet it
ruin my Iife.

14:57.429 --> 14:59.420
It's okay, Judi.
We're going.

14:59.498 --> 15:02.296
FIN: Where were you
Monday night?
Home with my wife.

15:02.368 --> 15:05.633
New kid,
so we don't get out much.
What is this about?

15:05.704 --> 15:07.729
MUNCH:
Do you know Bobby Douglas?

15:07.806 --> 15:11.799
We stayed in touch for a while
till he started weirding out.

15:11.877 --> 15:13.435
Look, I haven't seen him
for a couple of years.

15:13.512 --> 15:15.980
You have any idea
where he Iives?

15:20.119 --> 15:21.916
MUNCH: Bobby Douglas?
Yes.

15:22.888 --> 15:24.378
What can I do for you,
Officers?

15:24.456 --> 15:26.822
We spoke to your mom.
She said we could find you
down here.

15:26.892 --> 15:29.622
I help out
when I can take a break
from my studies.

15:29.695 --> 15:32.960
Do you know
Father Michael Sweeney?
Name sounds familiar.

15:33.032 --> 15:35.967
Well, he taught
at Saint Thomas'.
Didn't you go to school there?

15:36.035 --> 15:37.593
I've had a Iot of teachers.

15:37.670 --> 15:40.571
You told the school
to take a hike after they
wrote you a big fat check.

15:40.639 --> 15:44.166
Something must've happened.
I don't want to talk about it.

15:44.243 --> 15:46.370
Did you study Latin, Father?

15:47.046 --> 15:48.946
It's required at seminary.

15:49.014 --> 15:52.211
What does Peccavisti mean?
I don't remember.

15:52.584 --> 15:54.518
How about Monday night,
you remember that?

15:54.586 --> 15:55.951
I was studying.

15:56.021 --> 15:57.181
Where,
at Saint Martha's Church?

15:57.256 --> 15:59.622
So you could Ieave
Father Michael a message?

15:59.692 --> 16:01.683
No.
Do you remember him?

16:04.330 --> 16:05.661
Oh, my God.

16:07.466 --> 16:09.730
I could've been a good priest,

16:10.336 --> 16:13.134
but he ruined me,
he took away my Iife.

16:14.073 --> 16:15.335
Who did?

16:16.842 --> 16:20.334
Father Michael.
I had to expose him.

16:20.646 --> 16:23.240
MUNCH: So you tried
to burn down his church?

16:23.916 --> 16:25.474
He had sinned.

16:32.491 --> 16:36.791
Bobby was at
the homeless shelter Monday
night. What is this about?

16:36.862 --> 16:40.263
There was a crime committed
and we just want to make
sure Bobby wasn't involved.

16:40.332 --> 16:42.527
We have a warrant
to search your son's room,
Mrs. Douglas.

16:42.601 --> 16:43.898
Where is it?

16:43.969 --> 16:46.233
Down the hall on the Ieft.

16:46.305 --> 16:48.102
Bobby wouldn't do
anything wrong.

16:48.173 --> 16:50.869
What time did he come home
on Monday?
After midnight.

16:50.943 --> 16:53.343
I was asleep, but I woke up
when I heard him on the phone.

16:53.412 --> 16:56.040
Who was he talking to?
I don't know.

16:56.115 --> 16:58.242
Did you hear anything else?

17:00.319 --> 17:03.413
At 3:00 I woke up again.
I heard voices.

17:03.489 --> 17:06.252
I came downstairs
but it was only
Father Michael.

17:06.325 --> 17:09.157
Bobby told me
to go back to bed,
that everything was okay.

17:09.228 --> 17:11.388
Does Father Michael
come around a Iot?

17:11.463 --> 17:15.455
Well, yes especially
with Bobby trying
to get into the seminary.

17:18.404 --> 17:20.736
You mean
he's not a priest already?
Oh, of course not.

17:20.806 --> 17:24.037
You can't be a priest
unless you've been accepted
by the seminary.

17:24.108 --> 17:25.736
FIN: We got something.

17:27.179 --> 17:28.544
Excuse me.

17:30.549 --> 17:32.915
MUNCH: He's got a thing
for virgins
and a thing for purses.

17:32.985 --> 17:35.647
We found this in the trash.
It belongs to Jamie Doyle.

17:35.721 --> 17:38.383
It's got 250 bucks in it
and a dozen condoms.

17:38.457 --> 17:41.187
Looks Iike
Mr. Freaky-CIean Yoder's
in the clear.

17:41.260 --> 17:45.390
This was in the closet.
Tech sprayed Iuminol on it.
Hit the Iights.

17:48.500 --> 17:49.967
BENSON: BIood?
FIN: Yeah.

17:50.102 --> 17:52.002
And what Iooks Iike skin.

17:55.841 --> 17:59.368
BENSON: Your mom said that
Father Michael came over
in the middle of the night.

17:59.445 --> 18:02.573
Must've been
a pretty big deal?
Not really.

18:02.648 --> 18:05.674
Well, it sounds Iike
you wanted to get something
off your chest.

18:05.751 --> 18:07.184
No.
No?

18:07.386 --> 18:08.512
No.

18:13.759 --> 18:17.593
You killed him
with the flashlight
that we found in your room.

18:18.297 --> 18:20.697
But you treated him
with respect.

18:21.467 --> 18:23.059
You covered him up,

18:24.803 --> 18:27.738
Iit the candles,
those rosary beads
you gave him.

18:27.806 --> 18:29.967
I mean, obviously you cared.

18:30.742 --> 18:33.370
I said I was sorry
and I was forgiven.

18:35.180 --> 18:36.943
In confession?
Yes.

18:38.784 --> 18:41.184
You confessed
to Father Michael.

18:41.253 --> 18:43.619
That's between me and God.

18:43.689 --> 18:47.352
I did my penance.
Yeah and what's that?
Ten Hail Mary's?

18:50.162 --> 18:53.893
You haven't asked
Jamie Doyle's family
for forgiveness, have you?

18:53.966 --> 18:56.764
I can't face them.
Then Iet us help you.

18:57.669 --> 18:59.534
Tell us what happened.

19:01.106 --> 19:03.802
Oh, I'd already
started the fire.

19:07.346 --> 19:09.439
I didn't know he was there.

19:10.449 --> 19:12.314
He came up behind me.

19:12.918 --> 19:15.648
He startled me,
I swung the flashlight.

19:16.221 --> 19:20.157
He went down.
BIood started pouring.
He didn't move.

19:20.225 --> 19:21.419
(DOOR OPENING)

19:22.127 --> 19:25.392
This interview is over.
His mother called me.

19:25.964 --> 19:27.329
We have a confession,
Counselor.

19:27.399 --> 19:29.128
Well, you don't have it
in writing,

19:29.201 --> 19:33.035
and you won't get it,
unless I get to talk terms
with the A.D.A.

19:36.308 --> 19:37.332
Why should I deal?

19:37.409 --> 19:40.572
I've got his confession,
and a murder weapon
with his prints all over it.

19:40.646 --> 19:41.943
Stick a fork in him,
Kressler.

19:42.014 --> 19:45.074
He's a victim of abuse,
working out his rage
against the Church

19:45.150 --> 19:46.242
that ruined his Iife.

19:46.318 --> 19:49.082
Jamie Doyle
was not the Church.
He was an innocent victim.

19:49.154 --> 19:51.850
He was a transvestite hooker,
fresh from a trick

19:51.924 --> 19:54.415
and in Iight
of the psychological damage
inflicted on Bobby.

19:54.493 --> 19:56.393
Once I'm through
with the jury,
he won't serve a day.

19:56.461 --> 19:59.658
He killed a 16-year-old boy
who caught him
trying to burn down a church.

19:59.731 --> 20:01.358
I could try that in my sleep.

20:01.433 --> 20:04.197
The second the jury
hears the words
priest and abuse,

20:04.269 --> 20:06.931
whose side do you think
they'II be on?

20:07.940 --> 20:09.407
Man two. Eight-to-10.

20:09.474 --> 20:11.704
In this climate Bobby could
have torched a kindergarten

20:11.777 --> 20:13.438
and a jury would
still be sympathetic.

20:13.512 --> 20:16.606
Man two, five years probation
with psych treatment.

20:16.682 --> 20:18.673
Man two, five years
Kirby Psychiatric,

20:18.750 --> 20:20.911
and that depends on
what he has to tell us.

20:22.754 --> 20:25.279
There was this room
in the basement

20:25.357 --> 20:28.292
next to where they kept
the sports equipment.

20:29.161 --> 20:31.561
Father Michael
called it the Lair.

20:32.631 --> 20:37.068
He said that boys went in
as Iambs
and came out as Iions.

20:38.337 --> 20:42.865
He'd call me in there
after practice
for extra tutoring.

20:45.177 --> 20:47.975
He'd show me videos.
CABOT: What sort of videos?

20:48.614 --> 20:51.742
At first just sports.
Then porn.

20:52.884 --> 20:54.511
What sort of porn?

20:55.988 --> 20:57.353
AII sorts.

20:58.457 --> 21:02.018
Some with women,
some with boys.

21:03.595 --> 21:06.428
He'd say
I shouldn't be embarrassed,

21:07.199 --> 21:09.292
that how I was feeling
was normal.

21:12.070 --> 21:13.731
Did he touch you?

21:17.509 --> 21:19.602
He'd put his arm around me.

21:21.046 --> 21:23.105
He'd stroke my Iegs.

21:25.117 --> 21:27.381
Say I had good, strong thighs.

21:28.787 --> 21:30.448
How old were you, Bobby?

21:31.923 --> 21:33.185
Fourteen.

21:36.728 --> 21:38.821
What else did he do to you?

21:41.767 --> 21:43.792
Said I had to pass a test.

21:45.103 --> 21:46.434
What test?

21:49.808 --> 21:51.105
I had...

21:58.483 --> 22:00.246
I had to masturbate.

22:01.486 --> 22:03.283
He said he'd help me.

22:04.890 --> 22:06.721
Then, I had to do him.

22:08.327 --> 22:10.761
Afterwards, he said
I'd done well.

22:18.503 --> 22:21.495
I'd made a mark in heaven.

22:29.948 --> 22:31.540
(CHURCH BELL RINGING)

22:31.883 --> 22:33.748
RORY: Excuse me, Detectives.

22:35.387 --> 22:38.185
Rory O'Halloran.
I represent the Diocese.

22:38.256 --> 22:39.655
We have a warrant,
Mr. O'Halloran.

22:39.725 --> 22:41.955
Oh, of course you do.
We'd just Iike a Iittle word.

22:42.027 --> 22:43.324
STABLER: Who's we?

22:48.934 --> 22:51.129
Your Grace, EIIiot Stabler.
Hi.

22:51.203 --> 22:52.397
STABLER: OIivia Benson.

22:52.471 --> 22:55.338
You know Bishop Mallinson?
Yes. Of course.
How can we help you?

22:55.407 --> 22:59.776
Mr. O'Halloran says that
a search warrant has been
obtained for the rectory?

22:59.845 --> 23:03.246
Why is that?
We suspect Father Michael
of child abuse.

23:03.315 --> 23:06.250
You should be more concerned
with Bobby Douglas

23:06.318 --> 23:08.684
and his vendetta
against Father Michael.

23:08.754 --> 23:11.655
Why would Bobby
accuse Father Michael of abuse
if it weren't true?

23:11.723 --> 23:14.317
Because Father Michael
prevented him
from joining the priesthood.

23:14.393 --> 23:16.861
The priesthood
is under siege.

23:16.928 --> 23:18.987
Fragile men have crumbled.
We need strength.

23:19.064 --> 23:22.693
Father Michael has known Bobby
for years.
He felt he was immature.

23:22.768 --> 23:26.465
Are you aware that he was
impersonating a priest when
your colleagues found him?

23:26.538 --> 23:29.507
Feeding the homeless
is hardly a crime,
no matter what he was wearing.

23:29.574 --> 23:32.634
I know my priests,
Detectives.

23:32.711 --> 23:36.670
And believe me,
if I had anything
against Father Michael,

23:36.748 --> 23:39.148
it would already be
in your hands.

23:40.185 --> 23:42.119
But he's innocent.

23:42.187 --> 23:45.588
I'm sorry, Your Grace,
we need to
execute this warrant.

23:51.129 --> 23:52.892
Home, sweet home.

23:52.964 --> 23:55.228
At Ieast Father Michael's
keeping the vow of poverty.

23:55.300 --> 23:58.326
Take this back to the Iab,
scan the hard drive.

23:58.403 --> 24:02.806
I doubt we'd find any porn
on this. It's so ancient,
it hasn't got a modem.

24:03.475 --> 24:04.908
Nice video collection.

24:04.976 --> 24:09.345
STABLER: Any pornography?
Mostly all sports. NBA, NHL.

24:10.315 --> 24:11.839
Bag it all up.

24:15.353 --> 24:16.615
EIIiot...

24:17.456 --> 24:22.086
M. S. April 2001.
It's about the time
he Ieft the youth center.

24:25.764 --> 24:28.665
THERAPIST: Are you attracted
to boys, Michael?
Yes,

24:29.968 --> 24:31.230
What age?

24:33.004 --> 24:35.199
Thirteen, 14 years old,

24:36.475 --> 24:37.999
Tell me about your desires,

24:38.076 --> 24:39.771
What's this?

24:39.845 --> 24:42.746
Looks Iike some sort of
therapy session.

24:42.814 --> 24:44.839
I want to see them naked,

24:46.384 --> 24:51.219
In the showers,
at the youth club, I'll find
a reason to watch them,

24:51.556 --> 24:54.457
Do you approach
these boys?
Yes,

24:55.694 --> 24:59.255
If one shows interest,
a look is enough,

24:59.331 --> 25:01.595
or if he seems vulnerable,

25:03.401 --> 25:05.995
You feel a compulsion
to touch?

25:09.207 --> 25:13.769
I try to resist, but I'm weak,

25:16.515 --> 25:19.643
I'll pat him on the back
or put my arm around him,

25:19.718 --> 25:22.016
but I know I want more,

25:23.922 --> 25:25.514
Genital contact?

25:27.726 --> 25:28.715
Yes,

25:29.761 --> 25:31.626
Is that a confession
or a statement of intent?

25:31.696 --> 25:33.891
That sounds Iike
a confession to me.

25:33.965 --> 25:36.490
Actually, it's a part
of aversion therapy.

25:36.568 --> 25:39.765
The subject relates
his fantasies, they're
recorded, edited into a Ioop

25:39.838 --> 25:40.964
and played back for him

25:41.039 --> 25:43.974
while he masturbates
for 30 minutes
past the point of climax.

25:44.042 --> 25:46.772
That sounds painful.
It's supposed to be.

25:46.978 --> 25:49.208
It's behavior modification.

25:49.281 --> 25:52.546
The fantasies trigger
memories of pain,
instead of pleasure.

25:52.617 --> 25:54.278
BENSON: So does it work?

25:54.352 --> 25:56.149
Nothing can change
a sex offender's desires.

25:56.221 --> 25:57.279
Well, then why do it?

25:57.355 --> 26:00.518
Father Michael can't
change his desires, but
he can try to control them.

26:00.592 --> 26:04.028
That's what celibacy is
supposed to be all about,
controlling the desires,

26:04.095 --> 26:06.586
channeling the sexual urge
into the Iove for God.

26:06.665 --> 26:08.963
I thought celibacy was
a big part of the problem.

26:09.034 --> 26:13.027
Most celibate priests
are not sex offenders.
Our priest is.

26:13.104 --> 26:15.265
Well, if he gives
into temptation
then you're right.

26:15.340 --> 26:19.003
An alcoholic must avoid bars,
a pedophile must stay away
from children.

26:19.077 --> 26:20.806
Well, an alcoholic
is still an alcoholic

26:20.879 --> 26:22.938
and Father Michael
is still a pedophile.

26:23.014 --> 26:25.949
Actually, he's an ephebophile.

26:26.017 --> 26:28.042
He desires adolescents,
not children.

26:28.119 --> 26:31.418
Whatever you call him,
they're still children
and he's still a predator.

26:31.489 --> 26:34.754
The question is,
can you use this tape
to prove it?

26:38.663 --> 26:40.927
No judge is going to Iet you
introduce that tape.

26:40.999 --> 26:42.523
It's doctor-patient privilege.

26:42.601 --> 26:46.401
He hid it in his home.
That sounds Iike a turn-on,
not therapy.

26:46.471 --> 26:48.439
What he uses it for
doesn't alter what it is.

26:48.506 --> 26:51.407
The tape substantiates
Bobby Douglas's accusations.

26:51.476 --> 26:53.467
So what? You'II never
get it in as evidence.

26:53.545 --> 26:54.978
We could argue
it shows intent.

26:55.046 --> 26:57.981
To deal with his problem,
not to molest boys.

26:59.084 --> 27:01.450
You've got Bobby Douglas
in Rikers Iooking Iike
a fruit Ioop,

27:01.519 --> 27:03.783
and a tape that's privileged.
Your case is pathetic.

27:03.855 --> 27:06.153
So your answer is
to do nothing?

27:06.224 --> 27:09.716
My answer, Captain,
is that unless
I have bulletproof evidence,

27:09.794 --> 27:13.195
I am not jumping
on the bandwagon to crucify
the Catholic Church.

27:13.264 --> 27:17.325
Nearly 200 priests
have been implicated
in cases of abuse so far.

27:17.402 --> 27:21.634
Which is Iess than half
of one percent of the priests
in this country.

27:21.706 --> 27:24.675
What we need is someone
to corroborate Bobby's story.

27:24.743 --> 27:26.370
Another victim.

27:27.078 --> 27:28.739
BEN: You want to
interview the boys?

27:28.813 --> 27:30.974
Everyone between
the ages of 1 1 and 15

27:31.049 --> 27:34.382
who's had any contact
with Father Michael Sweeney
before he Ieft the club.

27:34.452 --> 27:36.420
You need to ask the parents.
We'II do that.

27:36.488 --> 27:39.082
Maybe you can answer
some questions for us,
Mr. Campion.

27:39.157 --> 27:40.181
Like what?

27:40.258 --> 27:42.658
You ever see Father Michael
show undue interest
in any one boy?

27:42.727 --> 27:43.751
No.

27:43.828 --> 27:46.228
Were there any boys
who always wanted to be
near him?

27:46.297 --> 27:48.424
Half the club.
Does that mean
they're all abused?

27:48.500 --> 27:50.024
What about boys acting up?

27:50.101 --> 27:53.366
Personality changes,
mood swings, temper tantrums?

27:53.438 --> 27:55.565
PIenty.
They call it puberty.

27:55.774 --> 28:00.711
Well, have any of the boys
Ieft abruptly, or been absent
for Iong periods of time?

28:01.813 --> 28:04.247
Only one. Darius Retafian.

28:04.315 --> 28:08.149
He stopped coming, I suppose
it was around the same time
Father Michael Ieft.

28:08.219 --> 28:09.982
Okay. You know why?

28:10.288 --> 28:12.449
I called the mother.

28:13.024 --> 28:16.016
She told me
to Ieave them alone,
and hung up.

28:17.796 --> 28:19.457
BENSON: Mrs. Retafian?
Yes?

28:19.531 --> 28:22.659
I'm Detective Benson,
this is my partner,
Detective Stabler.

28:22.734 --> 28:25.259
Would you mind
if we come in?
Sure.

28:27.272 --> 28:29.866
We just wanted
to ask you about Darius.

28:30.575 --> 28:34.204
Is he in trouble again?
Just wanna see
how he's doing.

28:34.279 --> 28:36.247
He's all right, I guess.

28:36.815 --> 28:38.612
Is this Darius?
Uh-huh.

28:39.117 --> 28:43.747
My kid just started serving
as an altar boy.
It's a proud moment.

28:43.822 --> 28:47.690
Can you tell us
why you pulled your son
out of the church youth club?

28:47.759 --> 28:50.125
He just wasn't
fitting in there.

28:51.563 --> 28:54.464
Did he have any contact
with Father Michael?

28:54.532 --> 28:56.124
The priest?

28:56.201 --> 28:59.295
Did he talk about him much,
anything Iike that?

29:02.574 --> 29:03.734
Yes.

29:05.610 --> 29:07.202
(CHOIR SINGING)

29:09.981 --> 29:11.346
Very good.

29:13.752 --> 29:15.481
STABLER: Father Michael!
Yes?

29:16.521 --> 29:19.388
We need you to come
with us, please.
Why?

29:19.791 --> 29:22.521
Don't make us do this
in front of them.

29:25.230 --> 29:27.528
Thank you all.
I'II see you next Thursday.

29:27.599 --> 29:30.659
WOMAN: Goodbye,
Father Michael.
MAN: Good night, Father.

29:35.340 --> 29:37.968
Am I under arrest?
For sexual abuse.

29:39.110 --> 29:40.634
You have the right
to remain silent.

29:40.712 --> 29:43.510
Anything you say
can and will be used
against you in a court of Iaw.

29:43.581 --> 29:44.775
You have the right
to an attorney.

29:45.450 --> 29:48.578
COURT OFFICER:
"Docket number 28385.
People v, Michael Sweeney,

29:48.653 --> 29:51.213
"Sex abuse two,
sex abuse three,
multiple counts"'

29:51.289 --> 29:53.018
AIexandra Cabot
for the People.

29:53.091 --> 29:55.082
Rory O'Halloran
for Father Sweeney.

29:55.160 --> 29:58.652
JUDGE SELIGMAN:
How do you plead?
Not guilty, Your Honor.

29:58.730 --> 30:00.095
Ms. Cabot,
are you asking for bail?

30:00.165 --> 30:02.929
The People request that bail
be set at $200,000.

30:03.001 --> 30:06.129
Your Honor, that's punitive.
Father Michael has taken
a vow of poverty.

30:06.204 --> 30:07.501
He has no assets.

30:07.572 --> 30:10.336
The Church has
more than enough money
to meet his bail, Your Honor.

30:10.408 --> 30:12.569
JUDGE SELIGMAN: The Defendant
has no priors, Ms. Cabot.

30:12.644 --> 30:15.442
Why are you demanding
such a substantial bail?

30:15.513 --> 30:16.775
In the Vatican's own words,

30:16.848 --> 30:21.285
"The defendant is guilty
of the serial, predatory
sexual abuse of minors"'

30:21.352 --> 30:22.944
He escaped detection
in the past

30:23.021 --> 30:27.458
with the complicity
of the Church and he is
believed to be a flight risk.

30:27.592 --> 30:29.617
Then bail is set at $200,000.

30:31.262 --> 30:33.025
Call the next case.

30:35.333 --> 30:36.766
Ms. Cabot?

30:37.168 --> 30:39.830
Coming to offer a deal?
Not this time.

30:39.904 --> 30:42.168
You want a trial,
you can have one.
My pleasure.

30:42.240 --> 30:44.071
Time to stop Father Michael
from molesting children.

30:44.142 --> 30:45.268
Father Michael is innocent.

30:45.343 --> 30:48.779
Then why did the Church
settle with his victims
in '96?

30:48.847 --> 30:51.315
Why did he seek therapy
to control
his sexual proclivities?

30:51.382 --> 30:54.510
There are explanations
for that.
I Iook forward
to hearing them.

30:54.586 --> 30:57.612
Then you'd better
prep your witnesses
for an ugly cross

30:57.689 --> 31:01.147
because I'm going to make
their Iives very unpleasant,

31:01.226 --> 31:02.659
however young they are.

31:02.727 --> 31:05.195
That should go over
really well with the jury.

31:05.263 --> 31:07.561
Whatever it takes
to clear him.

31:11.269 --> 31:13.567
CABOT: Okay, Darius,
Iet's go through this
one more time.

31:13.638 --> 31:17.574
When did you most often have
contact with Father Michael
at the club?

31:17.642 --> 31:20.805
After basketball,
he'd come by the showers.

31:20.879 --> 31:23.143
He'd hang around, talk.

31:23.581 --> 31:25.242
Did he touch you?

31:25.316 --> 31:27.511
He'd put his arm
around my shoulder,

31:28.419 --> 31:30.148
pat me on the back.

31:32.190 --> 31:34.385
Did he ever do
anything else?

31:38.763 --> 31:40.025
At his place.

31:41.399 --> 31:43.833
It's okay, baby.
You just tell her.

31:46.504 --> 31:50.133
He'd ask me to watch videos
with him.
What kind of videos?

31:50.275 --> 31:51.902
Sports, movies,

31:54.612 --> 31:56.637
then other stuff.

31:59.250 --> 32:00.308
Porn.

32:01.786 --> 32:03.413
Then what would he do?

32:06.624 --> 32:08.091
He'd sit

32:10.228 --> 32:11.627
real close.

32:13.464 --> 32:16.160
He'd tell me it was okay
to feel what I was feeling.

32:18.269 --> 32:19.759
That it was normal.

32:20.471 --> 32:21.460
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

32:22.373 --> 32:23.362

32:32.083 --> 32:34.313
What are you doing here?
Trying to save your face,
Counselor.

32:34.385 --> 32:37.548
Can I talk to your witness?
So you can intimidate him?
No.

32:37.622 --> 32:39.453
Then Iook at this.

32:42.927 --> 32:44.622
Recognize anything?

32:44.696 --> 32:47.221
But this has no bearing
on what Darius is saying now.

32:47.298 --> 32:48.287
Really?

32:48.833 --> 32:51.529
Then Iet me suggest
a Iittle experiment.

32:51.636 --> 32:54.833
Ask the witness about
Father Michael's television.

32:56.341 --> 32:59.174
CABOT: Did you watch
these videos
on Father Michael's TV?

33:00.178 --> 33:01.167
Yeah.

33:01.846 --> 33:04.041
Was there anything funny
about them?

33:05.316 --> 33:07.045
What does she mean?

33:07.585 --> 33:11.919
When you watched the videos,
did you notice anything
unusual about them?

33:11.990 --> 33:14.458
You're asking a child
to judge pornography?

33:14.525 --> 33:17.221
Was it Iike watching
normal TV, Darius?

33:18.930 --> 33:20.124
Yeah.

33:21.399 --> 33:23.094
Was it in color?

33:24.268 --> 33:26.964
What else is there?

33:28.673 --> 33:30.300
BIack and white.

33:32.610 --> 33:36.102
Father Michael
is a few decades
behind the times.

33:36.180 --> 33:37.238
What is this?

33:37.315 --> 33:40.512
Darius was abused
at his school,
nowhere near Father Michael.

33:40.585 --> 33:43.554
And you settled
with the Church for $50,000.

33:43.621 --> 33:46.454
Father Michael molested him.
No, he didn't.

33:46.924 --> 33:48.357
You recycled those accusations

33:48.426 --> 33:51.554
when you and your son
were questioned
by the detectives.

33:52.430 --> 33:54.990
And you think your priest
isn't guilty, too?

33:55.633 --> 33:58.124
Darius will never forget
what was done to him.

33:58.202 --> 34:00.033
No money will make up
for that.

34:00.104 --> 34:04.040
And you would make him
re-Iive his trauma
to get every penny you can.

34:06.310 --> 34:07.800
(DOOR CLOSING)

34:08.379 --> 34:11.643
The details of Darius' abuse
were true.
He was alone with a priest,

34:11.716 --> 34:14.583
and he watched porn videos,
and he was molested.

34:14.652 --> 34:18.748
Mom sued, a priest
was defrocked, the diocese
settled. Mom wants more.

34:18.822 --> 34:21.223
If someone abused my son,
I'd do more than sue them.

34:21.292 --> 34:23.317
I doubt
you'd make false accusations.

34:23.393 --> 34:26.522
So where does that
Ieave us now?
Father Michael's
going to walk.

34:26.597 --> 34:29.657

is all we've got.
Not anymore.

34:37.675 --> 34:39.404
(JAIL DOOR BUZZING)

35:15.680 --> 35:18.672
Bobby Douglas was placed
in a cell with a Iifer.

35:18.749 --> 35:20.944
His name is Dale Farrelly.

35:21.018 --> 35:24.215
Bobby kept trying to tell Dale
how much Jesus Ioved him,

35:24.288 --> 35:28.088
till Dale stopped him
by stabbing him 57 times
with a homemade shiv.

35:28.159 --> 35:32.596
This is the interesting part
though, Father. Bobby had
no defensive wounds on him.

35:32.663 --> 35:34.392
He had no cuts on his arms
and his hands.

35:34.465 --> 35:38.026
He never even tried
to put up his arms
to protect himself.

35:38.102 --> 35:40.730
That boy'd given up.
Now maybe you think
he deserved it

35:40.805 --> 35:42.796
because he killed that kid
and he burned your church.

35:42.874 --> 35:45.707
No. No. Bobby was a victim.
Yeah. Whose victim?

What do you want me
to tell you?

...no collar. Come on.
Bobby's dead!
You're free as a bird.

Be a man, confess to me!
AII right! AII right!
It was me. I abused him.

35:57.955 --> 36:00.719
How?
I took him to my room,

36:01.259 --> 36:03.819
gave him some beer
and made him have sex with me.

36:03.895 --> 36:05.556
What about the videos?
Yes.

to get us in the mood.

36:10.268 --> 36:11.257
Where?

36:11.802 --> 36:15.533
I told you, in my room.
When did you go to the Lair?

36:19.477 --> 36:20.671
Tell me what you told
the boys,

36:20.745 --> 36:23.179
how they'd go in Iike Iambs,
come out Iike Iions.

36:26.784 --> 36:29.480
You have no idea
what I'm talking about.

36:30.855 --> 36:35.189
Somebody must do penance
for Bobby.
Oh, yeah.
But it ain't you, is it?

36:36.527 --> 36:39.052
And those therapy sessions,
is that all fiction, too?

36:39.130 --> 36:40.722
That was real.
You give me the names

36:40.798 --> 36:42.925
of the boys you abused.
There are no names.

36:43.000 --> 36:47.130
I've controlled my desires.
I have kept every one
of my vows,

36:47.205 --> 36:50.800
poverty, chastity, obedience.
Well, then why'd Bobby
accuse you?

36:52.677 --> 36:56.374
Because he came to me
for help,
and I didn't protect him.

36:57.648 --> 37:01.209
Why'd you Ieave school?
Shame.
For what I failed to do.

37:01.285 --> 37:05.153
Failed to protect him
against another priest, yeah?
Right?

37:05.223 --> 37:07.248
Yes.
I want a name.

37:07.825 --> 37:11.283
I can't. He confessed.

37:13.931 --> 37:17.697
You priests,
you got it all figured out,
don't you?

37:17.768 --> 37:18.928
You confess to each other.

37:19.003 --> 37:20.971
You forgive each other,
and you go right on sinning.

37:21.038 --> 37:22.835
I'm sorry.
Go to hell.

37:27.144 --> 37:31.581
He's covering
for another priest, just Iike
he covered for Bobby Douglas.

37:31.782 --> 37:34.615
No court is going to force him
to break the seal
of confession.

37:34.685 --> 37:37.085
Then we Iook
at the '96 case again.

37:37.154 --> 37:39.145
This priest must have been
at Saint Tom's

37:39.223 --> 37:41.248
when Bobby and the other boys
were abused.

37:41.325 --> 37:44.089
Check the staff roster.
Check if any other payments
were made.

37:44.161 --> 37:47.961
I want you to subpoena
any records and bank accounts
that we have to.

37:48.032 --> 37:51.399
Easy to say,
but on what grounds?
BENSON: What about RICO?

37:51.469 --> 37:54.802
D.A"s tried it in CIeveland,
in Texas, even in Jersey.

37:54.872 --> 37:56.305
And two out of three failed.

37:56.374 --> 37:59.434
Well, I'II take those odds,
AIex. What else do we have?

38:02.980 --> 38:05.175
JUDGE LINDEN:
Racketeering, Ms. Cabot?

38:05.249 --> 38:08.776
New Jersey already
dismissed a RICO case
against the Church.

38:08.853 --> 38:12.380
But the violations
have continued, and innocent
people are still being harmed.

38:12.456 --> 38:14.617
Mr. O'Halloran?
The Church has been
more than willing

38:14.692 --> 38:18.560
to turn over documents
for cases of abuse by priests
without the necessity

38:18.629 --> 38:21.097
of a subpoena.
When it suits them.

38:21.165 --> 38:24.157
Only yesterday, Mr. O'Halloran
showed me a secret settlement

38:24.235 --> 38:26.863
the Diocese made
with the family
of a 14-year-old boy.

38:26.937 --> 38:28.370
Now how many more
of these are there?

38:28.439 --> 38:31.772
We'II turn over files relating
to all allegations of abuse,

38:31.842 --> 38:35.835
but the request for the
Diocese's discretionary
accounts overreaches.

38:35.913 --> 38:37.403
We have some rights
to privacy.

38:37.481 --> 38:40.211
The accounts will show
how the Church has
consistently made payouts

38:40.284 --> 38:43.685
to individuals to buy
their silence and evade
criminal investigation.

38:43.754 --> 38:46.780
That is a definition
of a corrupt organization
under RICO.

38:46.857 --> 38:50.725
I'm inclined to agree.
You have your subpoena,
Ms. Cabot.

38:50.828 --> 38:53.490
The Diocese will surrender
all reports of abuse,

38:53.564 --> 38:57.967
all records of priest
transfers, and will give
the New York District Attorney

38:58.035 --> 39:01.163
access to the Diocese's
discretionary accounts.

39:02.340 --> 39:04.570
AII right. We got payments
to the Ramsay family,

39:04.642 --> 39:06.872
to the Campions,
to the Zuniga family.

39:06.944 --> 39:10.812
Checks drawn in October '96,
$150,000 each.

39:10.881 --> 39:14.612
What about Bobby Douglas?
We've got Mary Douglas,
$100,000.

39:14.719 --> 39:18.211
Bobby even Iost out
in the abuse stakes.
Who signed the checks?

39:18.289 --> 39:20.018
Looks Iike Randall.

39:21.559 --> 39:23.891
John Randall,
Bishop before Mallinson.

39:24.762 --> 39:27.424
The cover-up went straight
to the top.
And stayed there.

39:27.498 --> 39:30.729
Every quarter Mary Douglas
gets $10,000 from the Diocese.

39:30.801 --> 39:34.464
Each check is signed
by Bishop Mallinson
right up until Iast month.

39:34.538 --> 39:37.166
Why would Mallinson
continue making the payments?

39:37.241 --> 39:41.735
Maybe because he started them.
Staff roster
for Saint Thomas', 1996.

39:41.946 --> 39:45.211
Guess who was
a visiting Latin teacher
three times a week?

39:45.282 --> 39:48.342
Father Mallinson.
And Bobby was his star pupil.

39:51.622 --> 39:53.522
STABLER: I know
who you're protecting.

39:58.295 --> 40:00.593
I need to know
what he told you.

40:01.832 --> 40:03.322
I can't.

40:09.707 --> 40:12.073
Why'd you
become a priest, Father?

40:15.346 --> 40:17.211
To serve God and his Church.

40:18.749 --> 40:21.479
That includes those boys
that were abused.

40:23.387 --> 40:25.116
How are you serving them?

40:27.091 --> 40:30.925
To the best of my ability
without breaking
the Sacraments.

40:31.095 --> 40:33.086
By protecting the sinner.

40:33.364 --> 40:36.959
By protecting a priest
who confessed that,

40:37.034 --> 40:39.229
"I am abusing a child"'

40:41.405 --> 40:43.873
He promised me
that he would get treatment.

40:43.941 --> 40:48.674
Then he came back to you
and confessed the same sin
all over again, didn't he?

40:50.481 --> 40:53.678
And you absolved him again.

40:56.086 --> 40:58.884
What, because you are bound
by your Sacrament?

40:58.956 --> 41:00.116
Yes.

41:01.659 --> 41:05.425
Silence is a sin, Father.
I cannot break the seal.

41:05.496 --> 41:08.795
Not to defend my name,
not to save my own Iife,

41:08.866 --> 41:12.859
not to save
someone else's Iife. I have
to protect the penitent.

41:15.673 --> 41:17.937
But what
of the faithful, Father?

41:19.143 --> 41:20.770
Who protects us?

41:36.727 --> 41:38.490
What about my vows?

41:41.198 --> 41:42.893
What about the children?

41:52.776 --> 41:53.902
STABLER: Your Grace.

41:54.979 --> 41:58.415
Detective Stabler. Michael.
How can I help you?

42:01.085 --> 42:03.815
I need to ask you
about statements you made
to Father Michael

42:03.888 --> 42:06.857
in July and September of 1996.

42:09.159 --> 42:10.490
What statements?

42:11.362 --> 42:15.799
Relating to sexual acts that
you forced on various boys
at Saint Thomas's school.

42:17.902 --> 42:18.926
No.

42:19.370 --> 42:22.669
See, what's shared
in the confession between
a priest and a penitent

42:22.740 --> 42:25.607
is sacred and confidential.

42:30.848 --> 42:33.544
Michael, do you know
what you've done?

42:37.254 --> 42:41.884
You'II be expelled
from the priesthood and you'II
be cast out of the Church,

42:42.826 --> 42:44.623
barred from the Sacraments.

42:45.396 --> 42:47.523
You're risking your soul.

42:49.400 --> 42:52.164
I... I believe I'm saving it.

43:00.477 --> 43:02.468
How could you do this?

43:09.987 --> 43:11.887
I couldn't help myself.
