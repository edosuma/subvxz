Going long.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.367
Nice catch!

01:08.369 --> 01:09.635
Coming back at you.

01:12.005 --> 01:14.673
Sofia, it's time
for school.

01:14.675 --> 01:17.609
Okay. We're just finishing off
some dazzleball practice.

01:21.014 --> 01:22.714
Oh, good grab.

01:22.716 --> 01:24.249
Can we practice more
tomorrow, Dad?

01:24.251 --> 01:26.218
Absolutely, Sofia.

01:26.220 --> 01:27.586
Same time, same palace.

01:27.588 --> 01:29.088
( giggles )
You got it.

01:30.390 --> 01:32.791
Bye, Dad.

01:38.865 --> 01:40.466
ALL: Good morning,
Miss Elodie.

01:40.468 --> 01:42.534
It is not
a good morning.

01:42.536 --> 01:44.403
It's a great morning,

01:44.405 --> 01:48.140
because I have
some very exciting news.

01:48.142 --> 01:49.875
At the end of the week,
we're taking

01:49.877 --> 01:51.543
our dads and daughters
field trip

01:51.545 --> 01:54.146
to the enchanted
animal park.

01:54.148 --> 01:56.081
- Excellent!
- Fabulous!
- Fun!

01:56.083 --> 01:58.150
Dads and daughters
field trip?

01:58.152 --> 01:59.651
Oh, that's right, Sofia.

01:59.653 --> 02:01.386
You've never gone before.

02:01.388 --> 02:02.888
We go canoeing
with our dads,

02:02.890 --> 02:04.423
have a picnic
with our dads,

02:04.425 --> 02:06.258
play games
with our dads.

02:06.260 --> 02:08.260
And best of all,
we get to see

02:08.262 --> 02:10.562
the amazing enchanted
animals we've been
learning about

02:10.564 --> 02:11.964
face to face.

02:11.966 --> 02:13.932
Nose to snout.

02:13.934 --> 02:17.402
Eye to bright purple eye!

02:17.404 --> 02:18.971
With our dads.

02:18.973 --> 02:21.940
That sounds amazing.
I can't wait to go.

02:21.942 --> 02:23.909
You'll have
a wonderful time, Sofia.

02:23.911 --> 02:26.612
Even if King Roland
isn't your real father.

02:26.614 --> 02:29.081
- Hildegard!
- Why would you say that?

02:29.083 --> 02:31.917
I just meant that
he only became your dad
when your mom married him.

02:31.919 --> 02:34.086
That makes him
Sofia's step-dad,

02:34.088 --> 02:36.421
and step-dads are
just as real as dad-dads.

02:36.423 --> 02:37.956
Yes, of course they are.

02:37.958 --> 02:39.892
Forget I said
anything, Sofia.

02:46.199 --> 02:47.866
Do I need to pack
a sun hat?

02:47.868 --> 02:50.769
No, Sofia, you need
to pack ten sun hats.

02:50.771 --> 02:52.104
Wow!

02:52.106 --> 02:54.773
You never know when you'll
need a wardrobe change.

02:54.775 --> 02:57.776
Hi, girls. Amber, sweetie,
look what I found

02:57.778 --> 02:59.311
when I was packing
for the trip.

02:59.313 --> 03:01.446
BOTH: The leaky canteen!

03:01.448 --> 03:03.549
( both laughing )

03:03.551 --> 03:05.684
The what?
I don't get it.

03:05.686 --> 03:07.819
Oh, it's just something
silly that happened

03:07.821 --> 03:10.055
on the last
dads and daughters field trip.

03:10.057 --> 03:12.858
I kept thinking
Daddy was drinking
all the water,

03:12.860 --> 03:15.327
and he kept thinking
I was drinking all the water.

03:15.329 --> 03:17.296
But really,

03:17.298 --> 03:21.667
BOTH: the canteen was leaking
the whole time!

03:21.669 --> 03:23.669
BOTH: I was gonna say
the same thing!

03:23.671 --> 03:26.705
( forced laughter )

03:26.707 --> 03:29.007
That must've been
really fun.

03:29.009 --> 03:31.810
What's this, Dad?

03:31.812 --> 03:33.645
Oh, that's
my lucky pocket watch.

03:33.647 --> 03:35.380
I never travel anywhere
without it.

03:35.382 --> 03:37.749
Oh, Daddy, can you
help us over here?

03:41.154 --> 03:44.656
That's a good picture
of Amber and James.

03:44.658 --> 03:46.491
Yes, it's one of
my favorites.

03:46.493 --> 03:48.193
Daddy, remember on
the last trip

03:48.195 --> 03:49.861
when I put out
a bowl of goldenberries

03:49.863 --> 03:51.496
for the picnic...

03:51.498 --> 03:54.533
BOTH: And a wonderbird
came and ate the whole bowl!

03:54.535 --> 03:56.501
( both laughing )

03:56.503 --> 03:58.003
Oh, classic me.

03:58.005 --> 03:59.571
Classic you.

04:02.942 --> 04:05.777
Sofia, are you
all packed for the trip?

04:05.779 --> 04:07.412
Almost.

04:07.414 --> 04:09.881
But I'm not sure
I should go.

04:09.883 --> 04:11.617
What do you mean?
Why not?

04:11.619 --> 04:15.287
Well, I'll be the only
one there with a step-dad.

04:15.289 --> 04:17.389
Everyone else
has a real dad.

04:17.391 --> 04:20.025
Oh, Sofia,
Roland is your dad.

04:20.027 --> 04:21.927
And he told me
he couldn't wait

04:21.929 --> 04:24.529
to go on this trip
with both his daughters.

04:24.531 --> 04:26.698
- He said that?
- Yes.

04:26.700 --> 04:29.201
You're going to have
a great time, Sofia.

04:29.203 --> 04:31.370
- Trust me.
- I hope you're right.

04:31.372 --> 04:34.106
I'm always right.
( giggles )

04:34.108 --> 04:35.874
Now come on, let's go
pack some snacks

04:35.876 --> 04:37.309
for the trip.

04:42.048 --> 04:43.548
Oh, there it is!

04:43.550 --> 04:45.784
ROLAND: The enchanted
animal park.

04:47.553 --> 04:49.655
SOFIA: Wow!

04:55.094 --> 04:58.063
Welcome, kings
and princesses.

04:58.065 --> 05:01.300
The enchanted
animal kingdom awaits!

05:05.772 --> 05:08.573
Daddy, where are
the enchanted animals?

05:08.575 --> 05:11.176
I'm sure we'll see one
soon enough.

05:11.178 --> 05:12.911
I want to see one now.

05:12.913 --> 05:14.746
Yes, of course.

05:14.748 --> 05:17.015
Anything for you,
honey darling.

05:17.017 --> 05:19.318
Miss Elodie.

05:19.320 --> 05:22.988
Hildegard would like to see
an enchanted animal right away.

05:22.990 --> 05:24.856
Well, you're in luck,
King Henrik,

05:24.858 --> 05:26.858
because here's one now!

05:26.860 --> 05:28.827
- Where?
- Right there.

05:31.431 --> 05:35.167
- That's a rock.
- Look a little closer,
everyone.

05:39.005 --> 05:42.140
Oh, it's a disguise-o-fly.

05:42.142 --> 05:43.842
Ding, ding, ding.

05:43.844 --> 05:46.445
Correct, my budding
enchanto-zoologist!

05:46.447 --> 05:49.514
Oh, these little guys
can make themselves

05:49.516 --> 05:52.284
look like anything.

05:52.286 --> 05:54.119
I want one.

05:54.121 --> 05:56.421
Oh, yes, darling.
I'll catch it.

05:57.957 --> 06:00.459
Uh-uh-uh.
I'm sorry, King Henrik.

06:00.461 --> 06:02.828
We're just visitors
in this park.

06:02.830 --> 06:04.996
We can't disturb
the animals that live here,

06:04.998 --> 06:07.399
no matter how
magnificent they are.

06:07.401 --> 06:09.234
We'll see many more
enchanted creatures

06:09.236 --> 06:10.869
on our canoe ride.

06:10.871 --> 06:13.038
To the river!

06:13.040 --> 06:14.573
Onward!

06:16.342 --> 06:19.010
And just like that,

06:19.012 --> 06:20.512
here we are.

06:20.514 --> 06:22.981
Everyone,
pick a canoe.

06:29.355 --> 06:31.556
Anchors aweigh!

06:31.558 --> 06:33.325
Oh, okay, Sofia.

06:33.327 --> 06:35.327
Last time Daddy
and I were on this trip,

06:35.329 --> 06:38.163
we worked out a great
system for paddling.

06:38.165 --> 06:41.199
Wait. Since when do you
paddle canoes, Amber?

06:41.201 --> 06:43.001
Oh, since never.

06:43.003 --> 06:45.737
But this is the one day
I force myself...

06:45.739 --> 06:48.507
I mean, I'm happy to do
outdoorsy things,

06:48.509 --> 06:50.041
because of
Daddy.

06:50.043 --> 06:53.178
Now, when I say row,
we all paddle.

06:53.180 --> 06:55.013
- Got it.
- Ready when you are.

06:55.015 --> 06:57.549
Row. Row.

06:57.551 --> 07:00.185
Sofia, you're making us
go too far right.

07:00.187 --> 07:02.721
Oh, okay.

07:02.723 --> 07:04.689
( Sofia straining )

07:07.226 --> 07:09.261
Now we're going
too far the other way.

07:09.263 --> 07:11.530
Oh, switch.

07:13.065 --> 07:14.800
Not everyone.

07:14.802 --> 07:17.135
No, no, just Sofia
was supposed to row

07:17.137 --> 07:19.104
on the other side.

07:20.573 --> 07:22.707
- Brace yourselves!
- ( Amber yells )

07:24.610 --> 07:26.378
I'm sorry.

07:26.380 --> 07:29.448
Don't worry, I'll get us
out of here.

07:31.451 --> 07:35.120
Sofia, maybe you should
just let Daddy
and me steer.

07:35.122 --> 07:37.289
It is easier when
it's just two people.

07:37.291 --> 07:39.891
Then you don't
have to keep switching
sides to go straight.

07:39.893 --> 07:41.793
Uh... okay.

07:41.795 --> 07:44.229
Back. Back.

07:44.231 --> 07:46.631
And turn.

07:48.768 --> 07:50.602
Nicely done, Amber.

07:50.604 --> 07:53.738
Yeah. You two make
a really good team.

07:53.740 --> 07:56.274
We'll get you paddling
again when we catch up
to everyone.

07:56.276 --> 08:01.012
Now, row. Row. Row!

08:03.282 --> 08:07.352
ALL: Forward, back,
forward, back.

08:07.354 --> 08:09.421
Forward, back.

08:09.423 --> 08:11.256
Daddy, row faster.

08:11.258 --> 08:12.858
Yes, honey darling.

08:14.527 --> 08:16.027
Let's do a spin, Dad.

08:16.029 --> 08:17.395
You got it, Kari.

08:24.036 --> 08:27.672
Row, row, row.

08:27.674 --> 08:29.207
Don't worry, Sofia.

08:29.209 --> 08:30.976
You just need
a little more practice.

08:30.978 --> 08:32.811
Oh, up ahead,

08:32.813 --> 08:35.480
I see a true
zoological treat.

08:35.482 --> 08:37.883
( trumpeting and honking )

08:40.152 --> 08:42.521
Who can tell me what those
gorgeous creatures are?

08:42.523 --> 08:44.122
They're pelicants.

08:44.124 --> 08:45.690
Half pelican,
and half elephant.

08:45.692 --> 08:47.459
That's right.

08:49.962 --> 08:53.298
HILDEGARD: Oh, Daddy,
make it stop!

08:53.300 --> 08:55.166
Ah, I love it.

08:55.168 --> 08:58.737
The sweet, soaking wet
cry of the pelicant.

09:05.177 --> 09:06.745
Look over there,
Miss Elodie.

09:06.747 --> 09:08.880
MISS ELODIE: Water zebras!

09:08.882 --> 09:12.017
My favorite striped
water animal.

09:12.019 --> 09:14.052
Well, them
and diving tigers.

09:14.054 --> 09:16.855
Except water zebras
won't eat you.

09:16.857 --> 09:19.691
Closer, Daddy.
I want to pet one.

09:19.693 --> 09:22.160
And I want to help
you pet one, Hildegard.

09:22.162 --> 09:24.029
Uh-uh-uh.
Remember, King Henrik,

09:24.031 --> 09:26.398
we are not here
to touch the animals,

09:26.400 --> 09:29.668
just admire them
from a safe distance,

09:29.670 --> 09:31.570
as in safe for
the animals.

09:31.572 --> 09:33.405
Of course,
Miss Elodie.

09:33.407 --> 09:35.173
But Daddy...

09:35.175 --> 09:37.375
Oh, look. It's time
to row ashore

09:37.377 --> 09:39.444
and have some more
dads and daughters fun.

09:39.446 --> 09:41.546
Are you sure
I can't help?

09:41.548 --> 09:43.381
Oh, it's okay, Sofia.

09:43.383 --> 09:44.916
We're almost there.

09:50.856 --> 09:53.191
Ooh, there it is, Daddy.

09:55.595 --> 09:58.563
- What is this?
- That's the imprint tree.

09:58.565 --> 10:00.365
If you put
your hand on it,

10:00.367 --> 10:02.534
it makes a magical
imprint that lasts forever.

10:02.536 --> 10:05.203
Oh, see? Here are Daddy
and my imprints

10:05.205 --> 10:07.706
from the first time
we came here.

10:07.708 --> 10:09.274
Oh...

10:09.276 --> 10:11.109
And there's Kari
and her dad's,

10:11.111 --> 10:13.244
and Lakshmi
and her dad's.

10:13.246 --> 10:14.446
Can I do my hand, too?

10:14.448 --> 10:16.081
Of course.

10:16.083 --> 10:18.116
Just place your hand
on the tree,
and keep it still.

10:18.118 --> 10:20.752
It takes a little while
for the magic to work.

10:20.754 --> 10:23.288
Gather round, everyone.
Gather round.

10:23.290 --> 10:26.591
Oh. I guess we'll
have to come back
and do it later, Sofia.

10:26.593 --> 10:28.460
Okay.

10:28.462 --> 10:31.896
Our first activity is
the rumbling bumbleweed race.

10:31.898 --> 10:34.766
Oh, Sofia, this is
a fun game.

10:34.768 --> 10:36.401
What's that?

10:36.403 --> 10:37.936
That is a bumbleweed.

10:37.938 --> 10:41.640
The racket-tail raccoons
like to bat them back and forth.

10:45.177 --> 10:46.778
We hold hands
with our dads,

10:46.780 --> 10:49.014
and jump over
the bumbleweeds
as we race, Sofia.

10:49.016 --> 10:51.182
Oh. That sounds tough.

10:51.184 --> 10:52.851
It's easier
than it looks.

10:52.853 --> 10:55.920
Not the first time.
Good luck, Sofia.

10:55.922 --> 10:58.123
All right,
dads and daughters.

10:58.125 --> 10:59.924
Line up and hold hands.

10:59.926 --> 11:01.593
The first team to reach
that tree

11:01.595 --> 11:04.095
without touching
a bumbleweed, wins.

11:04.097 --> 11:07.599
And remember, you must
hold hands the whole time.

11:07.601 --> 11:10.101
Daddy and I
are really good at this.

11:10.103 --> 11:11.436
We won last time.

11:11.438 --> 11:13.638
- No pressure.
- Right. No pressure.

11:13.640 --> 11:15.106
Everyone ready?

11:15.108 --> 11:18.043
On your mark,
get set, go.

11:20.946 --> 11:22.747
Ready, and jump.

11:23.683 --> 11:25.316
- Oh!
- Sorry.

11:25.318 --> 11:27.185
- I'm okay.
- Keep running.

11:29.021 --> 11:30.855
AMBER: Oh, we have
to catch up.

11:30.857 --> 11:32.791
Here comes another
bumbleweed.

11:32.793 --> 11:35.126
We all have to jump
at the same time, Sofia.

11:35.128 --> 11:37.429
And... jump.

11:41.567 --> 11:43.968
We won, we won!

11:43.970 --> 11:45.637
Yes, we did, Lakshmi.

11:45.639 --> 11:47.005
Oh!

11:47.007 --> 11:48.840
Sorry.

11:48.842 --> 11:50.842
I tried to jump at
the same time as you guys.

11:50.844 --> 11:52.744
Don't worry
about it, Sofia.

11:52.746 --> 11:54.312
It's just a silly game.

11:54.314 --> 11:55.647
Follow me, everyone.

11:55.649 --> 11:57.649
We're moving on to
our next activity.

11:57.651 --> 12:00.185
Sofia, is something wrong?

12:00.187 --> 12:02.487
I feel like I keep
getting in the way.

12:02.489 --> 12:04.923
You and Dad are better
at doing everything
together.

12:04.925 --> 12:06.591
Well, of course we are.

12:06.593 --> 12:08.426
Daddy and I have been
on this trip three times,

12:08.428 --> 12:11.329
so we've had lots of
practice rowing and
racing together.

12:11.331 --> 12:12.731
I guess.

12:12.733 --> 12:14.165
You just haven't
had as much time

12:14.167 --> 12:16.067
to do all this stuff
with him.

12:16.069 --> 12:18.169
Oh, why don't I sit out
the next activity

12:18.171 --> 12:21.372
so you and Daddy can
spend some time just
with each other?

12:21.374 --> 12:23.908
Wow. That's really nice
of you, Amber.

12:23.910 --> 12:25.844
Oh, Sofia, it's nothing.

12:25.846 --> 12:27.479
Come on, let's go.

12:29.682 --> 12:32.183
All right, everyone,
take a seat in the circle.

12:32.185 --> 12:34.919
We have one more activity
before snack time.

12:34.921 --> 12:37.222
Our father-daughter
singalong.

12:37.224 --> 12:38.723
Oh, my favorite.

12:38.725 --> 12:40.592
I hope you've been
practicing, Daddy.

12:40.594 --> 12:42.227
Of course I have,
sweetums.

12:42.229 --> 12:43.895
KARI: I love the singalong.

12:43.897 --> 12:45.864
Are you sure it's okay
for just me and Dad to do this?

12:45.866 --> 12:47.232
Mm-hmm.

12:47.234 --> 12:50.235
So, girls, ready to
sing our hearts out?

12:50.237 --> 12:52.971
Actually, Daddy,
( clears throat )

12:52.973 --> 12:54.973
my voice is
a little hoarse.

12:54.975 --> 12:58.476
Why don't I rest,
and you and Sofia
sing together?

12:58.478 --> 13:00.712
Just the two of you.

13:00.714 --> 13:01.880
Oh. All right then.

13:01.882 --> 13:03.381
All right, everyone.

13:03.383 --> 13:06.885
It's time to...
♪ si-i-i-ing! ♪

13:06.887 --> 13:08.887
Can we do the dads
and daughters song first?

13:08.889 --> 13:10.288
Good choice.

13:10.290 --> 13:11.790
I love that one.

13:11.792 --> 13:13.925
Absolutely. You will
each take turns

13:13.927 --> 13:14.926
around the circle.

13:14.928 --> 13:17.128
I don't know that song.

13:17.130 --> 13:18.963
Just listen to
everyone else.

13:18.965 --> 13:21.733
You'll pick up by the time
it gets to us. No problem.

Sorry, Dad.

14:23.363 --> 14:25.663
Sorry, everyone.

14:25.665 --> 14:28.132
- Sofia, wait.
- Oh, no.

14:28.134 --> 14:31.202
Uh, perhaps we should
keep going.

14:38.677 --> 14:40.645
- Wait!
- What?

14:40.647 --> 14:43.481
Look at that big,
beautiful egg, Daddy.

14:43.483 --> 14:46.150
- I want it.
- Of course you do.

14:46.152 --> 14:48.887
And I'll fetch it for you
straight away.

14:48.889 --> 14:50.722
No, no, no.
King Henrik.

14:50.724 --> 14:52.056
Do not take
another step.

14:52.058 --> 14:54.492
That belongs to
a pelicant,

14:54.494 --> 14:57.161
and you do not want
to make a pelicant angry.

14:57.163 --> 15:00.231
And you do not want
to make my Hildy angry.

15:02.835 --> 15:05.737
See? Everything's fine.

15:05.739 --> 15:08.072
( angry trumpeting )

15:08.074 --> 15:09.841
Oh! Uh-oh.

15:09.843 --> 15:12.343
Sofia, what's wrong?

15:12.345 --> 15:14.379
Why did you run off
like that?

15:14.381 --> 15:16.347
I... I shouldn't
have come on this trip.

15:16.349 --> 15:17.782
What do you mean?

15:17.784 --> 15:19.550
All the other
dads and daughters

15:19.552 --> 15:21.953
know each other
so well.

15:21.955 --> 15:24.355
We haven't done
anything right
together all day.

15:24.357 --> 15:27.859
That's only because you've
never done any of it
with me before.

15:27.861 --> 15:30.795
No. It's because I'm
just your step-daughter.

15:30.797 --> 15:32.697
I'll never be
your real daughter.

15:32.699 --> 15:35.867
Sofia, that's
just not true.

15:35.869 --> 15:38.036
KING HENRIK: Hildy, everyone,
run!

15:38.038 --> 15:39.604
( all screaming )

15:39.606 --> 15:41.439
Oh, no.

15:45.577 --> 15:48.379
We can take refuge
in that tree.

15:48.381 --> 15:51.916
King Henrik, give back
the pelicant egg now!

15:51.918 --> 15:54.919
All right, all right.
The egg!

15:54.921 --> 15:57.288
It's falling,
it's falling. Oh, no!

16:04.430 --> 16:07.498
Make room for me,
make room for me!

16:09.468 --> 16:12.337
Henrik, what did you
do with the egg?

16:12.339 --> 16:15.239
I tried to give it back,
but it fell in the gulley.

16:15.241 --> 16:16.841
( gasping )

16:16.843 --> 16:19.777
The egg's in the gulley.

16:19.779 --> 16:21.479
They can't understand you.

16:21.481 --> 16:23.481
And now we're trapped.

16:23.483 --> 16:26.617
And all because you had to
have that egg, Hildegard.

16:26.619 --> 16:28.119
I'm sorry.

16:28.121 --> 16:30.254
I didn't know
this would happen.

16:30.256 --> 16:32.523
How could you know,
sweetums?

16:32.525 --> 16:34.525
Because I told you
it would happen.

16:34.527 --> 16:36.160
Sorry, Miss Elodie.

16:39.932 --> 16:42.800
The pelicants don't know
the egg rolled in the gulley.

16:42.802 --> 16:44.769
It's up to us to get
the egg back.

16:44.771 --> 16:46.604
Sofia, wait.

16:46.606 --> 16:48.606
If the pelicants see us,
they'll come after us, too.

16:48.608 --> 16:51.676
We should stay here
until we think of a plan.

16:56.148 --> 16:57.782
Oh, the sun.

16:57.784 --> 16:58.950
I know how we can
get the egg.

16:58.952 --> 17:01.452
Your pocket watch?

17:01.454 --> 17:02.954
How will that help?

17:02.956 --> 17:05.356
We can bounce sunlight
off of it and distract them.

17:16.902 --> 17:20.505
There. Now you take the watch
and keep distracting them

17:20.507 --> 17:22.040
while I go
get the egg.

17:38.657 --> 17:41.025
We're trying to get the egg.

17:41.027 --> 17:43.561
Sofia!
Gotcha.

17:43.563 --> 17:45.263
Hold tight.

17:49.234 --> 17:52.136
- Are you all right?
- I think so.

17:54.706 --> 17:57.141
Oh, your watch.

18:03.515 --> 18:05.616
There's a picture
of me in here?

18:05.618 --> 18:08.519
Of course, Sofia.
Why wouldn't there be?

18:08.521 --> 18:12.356
Because I'm not
your real daughter,
like Amber.

18:12.358 --> 18:16.094
Sofia, it doesn't matter
whether I was your dad
when you were born.

18:16.096 --> 18:18.096
I'm your dad now,

18:18.098 --> 18:20.631
and that makes me
your real father,

18:20.633 --> 18:22.633
and you my real
daughter.

18:22.635 --> 18:24.068
Now and forever.

18:24.070 --> 18:25.903
I love you, Sofia.

18:25.905 --> 18:27.738
Now and forever.

18:27.740 --> 18:29.474
Oh, Dad.

18:29.476 --> 18:31.309
I love you, too.

18:33.445 --> 18:34.812
( angry trumpeting )

18:36.548 --> 18:38.883
Look. The egg.

18:38.885 --> 18:40.718
We've got to get it
back to the pelicants.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.720
Right.

18:45.124 --> 18:48.092
Oh, I'm not sure
I can climb...

18:48.094 --> 18:50.962
and hold the egg
at the same time.

18:53.565 --> 18:55.233
I have to find
another way to get it out.

18:55.235 --> 18:59.070
- I know. We can
play catch.
- Catch?

18:59.072 --> 19:00.738
Like when we practice
dazzleball.

19:00.740 --> 19:02.140
Oh, right.

19:04.810 --> 19:07.645
- Throw me the egg.
- Here it comes.

19:09.314 --> 19:12.350
Now, climb above me,
and I'll throw the egg to you.

19:12.352 --> 19:13.818
Right.

19:14.786 --> 19:16.187
Now catch.

19:16.189 --> 19:17.922
Got it.

19:17.924 --> 19:22.860
- Throw it to me again.
- That's it.

19:22.862 --> 19:24.328
SOFIA: Here you go.

19:24.330 --> 19:25.763
KING ROLAND: Nice job.

19:25.765 --> 19:27.999
Good catch, Dad.

19:28.001 --> 19:30.368
- Almost there.
- Here.

19:30.370 --> 19:32.003
I got it.

19:35.174 --> 19:37.241
I've got your egg.

19:38.610 --> 19:40.711
Sorry about that.

19:40.713 --> 19:43.347
Just tell your friends
to keep their paws to
themselves, all right,

19:43.349 --> 19:47.318
or, uh, we'll take one of them
home as a souvenir.

19:47.320 --> 19:49.253
Okay, Mr. Pelicant.

19:51.156 --> 19:52.657
Well done, Sofia.

19:52.659 --> 19:54.859
You can come out now.
It's safe.

19:54.861 --> 19:56.227
You saved us.

19:56.229 --> 19:58.496
That was incredible, Sofia.

19:58.498 --> 20:00.298
Thank you so much.

20:00.300 --> 20:02.133
You and your dad.

20:02.135 --> 20:04.969
We make a good team,
don't you think?

20:04.971 --> 20:06.204
We sure do.

20:06.206 --> 20:08.005
Well, dads
and daughters,

20:08.007 --> 20:10.141
it's time to make like
hopping hippos

20:10.143 --> 20:12.376
and hop back home.

20:18.050 --> 20:19.317
The egg's hatching.

20:19.319 --> 20:21.319
Sh. Everyone be still.

20:21.321 --> 20:23.654
We have front-row seats
to one of nature's

20:23.656 --> 20:26.057
most precious moments.

20:35.834 --> 20:37.335
( all exclaiming )

20:47.512 --> 20:49.046
Almost done.

20:49.048 --> 20:51.215
And... there.

20:51.217 --> 20:54.118
- You can take
your hand away now.
- Oh!

20:55.621 --> 20:57.221
Right where it
should be, Sofia.

20:57.223 --> 20:58.689
Your hand with ours.

20:58.691 --> 21:01.025
AMBER: Three's even
better than two.

21:01.027 --> 21:02.693
It sure is.

21:02.695 --> 21:05.696
ALL: Row, row, row.

21:05.698 --> 21:08.733
- I think I'm getting it.
- You're doing great, Sofia.

21:08.735 --> 21:12.937
Yes, you are, which means
I can take a little break.

21:12.939 --> 21:14.572
Ah!

21:14.574 --> 21:16.240
Oh, Amber.

21:16.242 --> 21:17.608
Behold, everyone.

21:17.610 --> 21:19.710
Bubbling butterflies.

21:19.712 --> 21:22.246
I want one,
I want one.
Daddy!

21:22.248 --> 21:24.081
Hildegard, I'm going to
tell you something

21:24.083 --> 21:26.117
I should've said
a long time ago.

21:26.119 --> 21:28.085
No.

21:28.087 --> 21:30.821
Fine. Then I'll get
one myself.

21:32.891 --> 21:34.025
Hildegard!

21:38.764 --> 21:41.432
Eww! Daddy!

21:41.434 --> 21:43.434
I think it's time
you learned

21:43.436 --> 21:45.770
you can't get
everything you want,
Hildegard.

21:45.772 --> 21:48.439
Quite right,
Your Majesty.

21:48.441 --> 21:50.908
( frustrated groan )

21:50.910 --> 21:54.512
Ooh, you know what would
be really fun right now?

21:54.514 --> 21:55.913
BOTH: A singalong?

21:55.915 --> 21:57.982
I was going to say
the same thing.
