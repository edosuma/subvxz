Okay. Don't do that over
there, don't do that.

00:15.315 --> 00:17.479
Stop. Stop.

00:17.480 --> 00:19.000
Kids.

00:19.152 --> 00:20.786
- Ms. JoAnn?
- Oh, yeah?

00:20.960 --> 00:23.620
- It's all fixed.
- Oh. Okay!

00:23.623 --> 00:25.290
And here you go.

00:25.291 --> 00:27.226
- What's this?
- My invoice.

00:27.227 --> 00:28.900
Your invoice?

00:29.820 --> 00:30.840
Yeah.

00:31.630 --> 00:33.680
Terrance, this is a church.

00:34.360 --> 00:36.960
I know. And I did a lot of work.

00:37.160 --> 00:40.720
Well, but you need to do
something good for the Lord.

00:41.100 --> 00:43.460
Well, the Lord said "if you
don't work, you don't eat."

00:43.610 --> 00:47.100
Now Ms. JoAnn, you know
I looked out for you.

00:47.120 --> 00:48.580
I gave you a steep discount.

00:48.620 --> 00:51.100
[MUTTERS] That ain't steep enough.

00:51.750 --> 00:54.080
You know we're struggling around here.

00:54.187 --> 00:56.422
I'm sorry, Ms. JoAnn, but
I need to get paid.

00:56.423 --> 00:59.880
Well, maybe I can pray for you.

01:02.320 --> 01:04.819
All right. Well, you do
that, and then pay me.

01:04.860 --> 01:07.490
Oh. Okay.

01:07.500 --> 01:09.029
Okay. Ooh, okay.

01:09.030 --> 01:10.940
Ms. JoAnn.

01:12.672 --> 01:15.774
You know, the pastor would
really appreciate you.

01:15.860 --> 01:19.100
Yes, and I know, and I would
really appreciate getting paid.

01:19.180 --> 01:21.010
Okay.

01:21.014 --> 01:22.709
Such a handsome man.

01:22.710 --> 01:26.080
Why are you so hard up for money?

01:26.280 --> 01:28.620
[SCOFFS] Excuse me?

01:29.155 --> 01:30.789
Well, as good-looking as you are,

01:30.790 --> 01:34.159
I'm sure it'd be easy to
find yourself a sugar mama.

01:34.160 --> 01:36.780
If you were lookin' for one...

01:36.900 --> 01:39.190
[LAUGHS] Oops!

01:39.199 --> 01:41.333
Ohh...

01:42.780 --> 01:44.100
Are you lookin'? Are you lookin'?

01:44.140 --> 01:45.270
Are you lookin'?

01:45.271 --> 01:46.470
No, Ms. JoAnn.

01:46.480 --> 01:49.100
- I am not.
- Oh. I was just sayin'.

01:50.180 --> 01:51.909
I did all that work for the Paynes

01:51.910 --> 01:53.200
and they still haven't paid me.

01:53.240 --> 01:54.940
What? They haven't paid you yet?

01:54.960 --> 01:56.860
- No.
- Oh, that's horrible.

01:56.900 --> 01:57.910
Tell me about it.

01:57.940 --> 01:59.450
Well, why not?

01:59.452 --> 02:00.752
They said they're trying to get a loan.

02:00.753 --> 02:02.919
Oh. Well, that will take time.

02:02.920 --> 02:04.900
Yeah, time that I don't have.

02:05.190 --> 02:06.620
I'll get you paid.

02:06.759 --> 02:08.293
- Thank you, Ms. JoAnn.
- Sure.

02:08.294 --> 02:09.970
Let me just go talk to the treasurer.

02:09.979 --> 02:11.259
- Okay.
- Oops!

02:11.260 --> 02:13.260
- I'll get it.
- Oh.

02:13.280 --> 02:14.370
- I'll get it. I'll get it.
- Yeah, yeah.

02:14.380 --> 02:15.420
Oh, yeah, you get it, you...

02:15.440 --> 02:18.199
Ooh...

02:18.200 --> 02:20.160
You can get it.

02:20.240 --> 02:21.640
Ow!

02:22.570 --> 02:25.020
I mean, that thing... you can get it.

02:25.120 --> 02:26.320
Yeah, it!

02:27.881 --> 02:29.816
What is she talking about?

02:34.280 --> 02:35.720
- Hi.
- Hi.

02:36.020 --> 02:37.860
- How are you?
- Good.

02:38.020 --> 02:39.460
You look good.

02:39.690 --> 02:41.640
Thank you. [LAUGHS]

02:44.860 --> 02:46.520
Aren't you gonna get it?

02:46.760 --> 02:48.380
Oh. Oh.

02:55.942 --> 02:57.543
What was that?

02:57.544 --> 02:59.770
I just picked my pencil up.

02:59.780 --> 03:01.860
You know, you got to
bend from the knees.

03:01.920 --> 03:03.440
You don't want to hurt your back.

03:03.449 --> 03:04.950
Right.

03:04.951 --> 03:07.186
Safety first! Heh.

03:07.187 --> 03:09.919
Especially for a pencil.

03:09.920 --> 03:13.580
Okay. [LAUGHS]

03:14.090 --> 03:17.700
Look, Nyla, I'm just gonna
come out and say this.

03:18.230 --> 03:19.800
What?

03:20.430 --> 03:22.140
I would really like to take you out.

03:41.680 --> 03:44.480
- Take me out?
- Yeah.

03:44.720 --> 03:48.580
Like I told you before,
I have a boyfriend.

03:51.190 --> 03:53.580
- Sorry.
- What?

03:55.160 --> 03:56.780
What are you doing?

03:57.000 --> 03:58.680
Oh, I'm just...

03:58.905 --> 04:01.273
- just had to get my clipboard.
- Okay.

04:01.274 --> 04:04.660
- Okay.
- You're boyfriend's name is Kelly...

04:04.840 --> 04:07.200
- Uh, Kelsy...
- Kendrick?

04:07.480 --> 04:08.747
Nah, that ain't it.

04:08.748 --> 04:10.540
Uh...

04:10.750 --> 04:12.209
It's Kendrick.

04:12.210 --> 04:14.140
Oh, okay.

04:14.387 --> 04:16.178
But, uh,

04:16.180 --> 04:19.100
are you into him?

04:20.459 --> 04:21.700
Yes, I am.

04:21.827 --> 04:23.695
Mm.

04:23.696 --> 04:25.964
So, thanks. But...

04:25.965 --> 04:27.399
No, thanks.

04:27.400 --> 04:29.520
I see.

04:29.736 --> 04:31.300
I mean, it's not that I don't think

04:31.320 --> 04:33.680
you're a nice guy or anything.

04:33.700 --> 04:35.440
It's just that...

04:35.441 --> 04:36.869
Just what?

04:36.870 --> 04:38.840
I'm spoken for.

04:39.370 --> 04:40.720
- Yeah, okay.
- Mm-hmm.

04:40.840 --> 04:42.140
All right.

04:43.580 --> 04:44.860
But, thanks.

04:45.380 --> 04:48.159
No, no, no, you know, thank you,

04:48.160 --> 04:49.980
for the easy letdown.

04:50.189 --> 04:51.757
My ego's not crushed too much.

04:51.758 --> 04:53.158
- I mean...
- Oh, give me a break.

04:53.159 --> 04:55.727
I mean, I've been hurt before...

04:55.728 --> 04:57.629
Probably gonna be hurt again...

04:57.630 --> 04:59.264
Okay, all right.

04:59.265 --> 05:00.632
Okay, you just want...

05:00.633 --> 05:03.100
Are you fishing for a compliment?

05:04.237 --> 05:06.550
Look, as sexy as you are,

05:06.580 --> 05:08.440
I'm sure you have a lot of women, okay?

05:08.460 --> 05:10.100
You're good.

05:10.410 --> 05:11.469
So...

05:11.470 --> 05:12.860
You think I'm sexy?

05:14.640 --> 05:18.280
JOANN: Yeah! Hell yeah!

05:18.320 --> 05:19.700
Ms. JoAnn?

05:19.720 --> 05:21.180
Let 'em cover up their ears.

05:21.187 --> 05:23.179
The children.

05:23.180 --> 05:25.880
Let 'em cover up their ears!

05:27.620 --> 05:31.620
Anyway, as I was saying,
you think I'm sexy?

05:31.780 --> 05:34.290
Um...

05:34.300 --> 05:35.467
Not with that voice.

05:35.468 --> 05:38.260
Sorry. [LAUGHS]

05:38.700 --> 05:41.360
It sounded a little creepy.

05:41.600 --> 05:43.300
Just a little bit.

05:43.380 --> 05:46.680
- Yeah.
- [LAUGHS]

05:46.979 --> 05:49.739
But, no, I don't have anyone right now.

05:49.740 --> 05:52.680
What? That's a sin.

05:53.410 --> 05:56.040
And a shame.

05:56.856 --> 05:58.557
[SIGHS]

05:58.558 --> 06:00.770
- Don't mind her.
- I-I never do.

06:00.800 --> 06:02.820
Yeah.

06:02.995 --> 06:05.660
But seriously, that won't
take long because,

06:05.680 --> 06:07.270
um, hanging around this church

06:07.300 --> 06:10.059
you meet a lot of eligible women, so...

06:10.060 --> 06:12.640
Yeah, there's one right back here!

06:12.960 --> 06:15.700
[LAUGHS]

06:15.840 --> 06:18.379
You know, honestly,

06:18.380 --> 06:20.380
there's only one woman
that I want to meet.

06:20.780 --> 06:23.260
JOANN: Like I said, I'm back here!

06:24.510 --> 06:27.400
- She got ears everywhere.
- Yeah, she does.

06:29.789 --> 06:32.958
But Terrance, for real,
do those lines work?

06:32.959 --> 06:34.593
What lines? I'm not giving you lines.

06:34.594 --> 06:36.561
Yes, you are. Those lame lines.

06:36.562 --> 06:37.800
Those are not lame lines.

06:37.820 --> 06:39.260
Look, I had worked on them.

06:39.265 --> 06:40.766
Those are not lame lines.

06:40.767 --> 06:43.320
- I mean...
- Oh, yeah, girl.

06:43.380 --> 06:45.870
[LAUGHS]

06:45.872 --> 06:48.639
Look, I'm just trying to
tell you that I like you.

06:48.640 --> 06:50.280
You don't know me.

06:50.640 --> 06:52.400
But I'd like to.

06:53.240 --> 06:55.140
Well, I'm sorry.

06:55.381 --> 06:57.249
Okay, okay.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.700
All right. Let me ask you this.

06:58.800 --> 06:59.800
All right?

06:59.820 --> 07:04.280
Let's just say that you
weren't with, uh, Kelly.

07:04.380 --> 07:06.089
Kendrick.

07:06.090 --> 07:07.460
Yeah.

07:07.590 --> 07:09.500
Let's say that you weren't with him.

07:09.580 --> 07:10.860
Would you consider it?

07:10.900 --> 07:12.840
There's no need for us to discuss that

07:12.880 --> 07:14.100
because I'm with him.

07:14.140 --> 07:15.520
But if you weren't?

07:15.835 --> 07:17.330
- Terrance.
- No, come on.

07:17.360 --> 07:19.099
You know, just answer my question.

07:19.100 --> 07:20.336
- Not today.
- Satisfy my cur...

07:20.360 --> 07:22.099
- Oh.
- Sorry.

07:22.100 --> 07:23.760
Hey, now.

07:24.240 --> 07:26.500
Yeah, I got that effect on women, baby.

07:28.680 --> 07:30.639
Okay, I'm just a little dizzy.

07:30.640 --> 07:32.000
- I need to sit down.
- Okay, here.

07:35.820 --> 07:37.960
You want me to sit in this little thing?

07:39.620 --> 07:41.860
Just sit down.

07:42.094 --> 07:43.395
[SIGHS]

07:43.396 --> 07:45.140
- You need to go to the doctor?
- No, it's okay.

07:45.160 --> 07:47.429
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm fine. I just...

07:47.430 --> 07:49.700
I've just been doing a lot.
I need to rest. That's all.

07:49.800 --> 07:51.360
Okay. Well, here, I'll take you home.

07:51.370 --> 07:53.200
- Come on.
- No, no, no, no, no. I need to work.

07:53.220 --> 07:55.999
- No, you need to go home and rest.
- No, it's okay. I'm fine.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.400
No, I'll take you. Come on.
Let's go. Come on.

07:59.345 --> 08:01.539
Okay! Here you go.

08:01.540 --> 08:04.240
Nyla, what are you doing
in my little baby chair?

08:04.884 --> 08:06.651
- What's going on?
- She fainted.

08:06.652 --> 08:08.520
- Oh, no. What?
- Yeah.

08:08.540 --> 08:11.170
- Are you all right, Nyla?
- Yes. Yes, I'm fine.

08:11.190 --> 08:12.349
You don't fever?

08:12.350 --> 08:14.200
No, I just got up too fast.

08:15.127 --> 08:16.795
Oh. Oh. Oh. Yeah.

08:16.796 --> 08:17.829
But you were standing.

08:17.830 --> 08:19.431
Oh. Come on, now. You need to go home.

08:19.432 --> 08:21.270
No. It's okay, you guys. I'm fine.

08:21.280 --> 08:23.199
- Unh-unh. Nyla, go home.
- Come on.

08:23.200 --> 08:25.220
I'll call Ella and I'll tell
her that you're on your way.

08:25.240 --> 08:26.250
- Come on.
- Okay.

08:26.260 --> 08:27.260
- Mm-hmm.
- You sure?

08:27.270 --> 08:28.869
Yes, I'm fine. I'll be fine here.

08:28.870 --> 08:30.560
I'll call Ryan and he'll
come and help me.

08:30.580 --> 08:32.140
- Okay.
- Okay, Terrance, you take her home.

08:32.159 --> 08:34.039
- Yes, ma'am.
- Mm-hmm.

08:34.046 --> 08:35.708
Oh, uh, Ms. JoAnn?

08:35.710 --> 08:37.919
- Yeah.
- My money?

08:38.480 --> 08:41.539
A child could be dying and
you'd think about money.

08:41.600 --> 08:44.120
Let me try to find it.

08:50.590 --> 08:53.360
Smells like lilacs.

08:54.630 --> 08:56.100
I'll take your word for it.

09:05.144 --> 09:07.212
Here we go. Watch your step.

09:07.213 --> 09:08.439
- You got it?
- Yes.

09:08.440 --> 09:09.960
- You got it? You cool?
- I'm good.

09:09.980 --> 09:11.700
- Just checkin', just checkin'.
- I'm good.

09:11.710 --> 09:13.680
All right.

09:13.780 --> 09:15.200
Here you go.

09:15.760 --> 09:18.080
Okay, okay...

09:18.090 --> 09:19.140
I'm not dying.

09:19.200 --> 09:21.420
No, I'm just trying to make
sure that you're all right.

09:21.427 --> 09:23.995
- All right?
- I am, but I'm fine.

09:23.996 --> 09:26.600
- Here.
- Ooh. Okay.

09:26.640 --> 09:29.700
- Put your feet up.
- Okay, Terrance...

09:29.702 --> 09:32.504
Thank you, but I'm here
now and it's okay.

09:32.505 --> 09:33.805
- It's okay.
- You know what?

09:33.806 --> 09:35.560
I'll get you some water.

09:38.340 --> 09:41.660
- [WATER RUNNING]
- I don't need water.

09:41.810 --> 09:43.360
Here you go.

09:45.318 --> 09:47.519
Okay, thank you,

09:47.520 --> 09:48.900
but I don't need water, okay?

09:48.940 --> 09:50.620
Thank you. Thank you.

09:50.623 --> 09:53.024
All right. Well, uh...

09:53.025 --> 09:54.426
- Put your feet up.
- Oh.

09:54.427 --> 09:57.560
Terrance...

09:57.863 --> 09:59.297
Thank you, but I'm fine.

09:59.298 --> 10:00.960
Okay? I'm fine.

10:01.200 --> 10:02.534
Ms. Ella?

10:02.535 --> 10:03.969
She's not here.

10:03.970 --> 10:05.620
- She's not?
- Mnh-mnh.

10:08.540 --> 10:10.560
I can't with you.

10:11.410 --> 10:12.940
No, but seriously,

10:12.960 --> 10:15.000
someone needs to stay here with you.

10:15.640 --> 10:17.900
You don't need to do
that, really. I'm fine.

10:18.100 --> 10:20.949
I am not about to leave you
here so you can faint again.

10:20.950 --> 10:22.320
Then I'd feel terrible,

10:22.480 --> 10:25.140
so I'm gonna stay here with
you until she comes back.

10:25.390 --> 10:28.040
And I don't want to hear
another word about it.

10:29.920 --> 10:32.780
Okay, Mr. Persistent.

10:33.130 --> 10:34.960
Yeah, I am.

10:48.180 --> 10:51.100
Wha... ch... Yep! Get your...

10:51.180 --> 10:52.820

10:55.150 --> 10:57.580
It's crazy around here, man.

10:58.390 --> 11:01.740
I just got this thing painted!
I just got it painted.

11:02.795 --> 11:05.197
That ain't even locking right.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.560

- Here.

11:17.370 --> 11:18.880
What's that for?

11:19.010 --> 11:20.520
It's for you.

11:21.680 --> 11:24.000
- What is it?
- It's a sign.

11:24.310 --> 11:25.660
From God?

11:26.750 --> 11:29.480
- No, it's for you.
- Okay.

11:29.550 --> 11:31.200
You want me to go hang it up?

11:31.400 --> 11:32.660
No.

11:32.720 --> 11:34.800
I want you to go out on
the corner and spin it.

11:35.900 --> 11:37.259
Make it happen.

11:37.260 --> 11:40.040
Mr. C., I'm goin' spinnin'
myself. That's illegal.

11:40.132 --> 11:41.640
- Huh?
- That's illegal.

11:41.660 --> 11:43.420
No, it's not. Please.

11:43.500 --> 11:45.080
Is prostitution legal?

11:45.705 --> 11:47.472
It's not prostitution.

11:47.473 --> 11:49.320
It's to bring some
business in here, man.

11:49.340 --> 11:51.340
You ain't never seen the thang
where they're doin' flip...

11:51.343 --> 11:53.110
where they're doin'
the flip, flip, flip?

11:53.160 --> 11:55.279
Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo,
whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo.

11:55.280 --> 11:57.200
I don't want to do that.

11:57.410 --> 12:00.620
All you got to do is spin the damn sign.

12:01.020 --> 12:03.740
What if somebody see
me? I might go viral.

12:04.190 --> 12:06.820
Well, go viral with this.

12:09.995 --> 12:12.030
Wub wub!

12:12.031 --> 12:14.099
See? See? That would embarrass me.

12:14.100 --> 12:15.499
That's part of it, that's part of it.

12:15.500 --> 12:18.439
But then you do that.
Then you do like that.

12:18.440 --> 12:20.500
And then you hold then you wave.

12:20.580 --> 12:23.500
And then you wave.

12:23.509 --> 12:24.673
That's it. Simple.

12:24.674 --> 12:26.960
- I'm not doing that.
- Yes, you are.

12:27.180 --> 12:29.820
Yes, you will, and you will love it!

12:32.618 --> 12:34.849
- Well, guess what?
- What?

12:34.850 --> 12:36.880
They're not gonna recognize you anyway.

12:37.050 --> 12:38.180
How do you figure that?

12:38.390 --> 12:40.092
Stay right there.

12:44.296 --> 12:46.365
Wah-ah!

12:49.268 --> 12:52.004
Ah, ha, ha, ha!

13:01.580 --> 13:02.720
Close your eyes.

13:06.750 --> 13:08.680
'Cause you'll be wearing this.

13:10.240 --> 13:12.160
Mr. C., I'm not wearing that.

13:12.340 --> 13:13.719
Yeah, yeah, you will.

13:13.720 --> 13:15.200
Heck no.

13:15.280 --> 13:16.920
- Yes. You will.
- Mnh-mnh.

13:16.940 --> 13:18.299
- No, I will not.
- Yes, you will.

13:18.300 --> 13:19.310
I will not.

13:19.320 --> 13:21.759
On my grave, I'm not wearing that.

13:21.760 --> 13:23.700
Well, then you will not get paid.

13:24.060 --> 13:26.240
You haven't paid me
since I've been here.

13:27.670 --> 13:31.080
Well, then you will never, ever,
ever, ever, ever, ever get paid.

13:32.770 --> 13:34.500
All right.

13:34.747 --> 13:36.414
You're gonna do it?

13:36.415 --> 13:38.209
- Yeah.
- Mm.

13:38.210 --> 13:40.140
Try that on for size.

13:40.160 --> 13:42.380
Don't get it dirty, don't get it dirty.

13:42.388 --> 13:46.489
These are your gloves.

13:46.490 --> 13:48.120
Take it in the back.

13:49.390 --> 13:50.780
Go on, now!

13:50.920 --> 13:52.440
Get!

13:59.839 --> 14:01.139
I need you to leave.

14:01.140 --> 14:02.240
Look, I'm sorry.

14:02.300 --> 14:04.020
I-I didn't mean for that to happen.

14:04.270 --> 14:05.320
Well, it did.

14:05.340 --> 14:06.740
It's just that I was lookin' at you

14:06.745 --> 14:08.580
- and I got caught up and...
- Stop.

14:08.581 --> 14:11.279
- Just stop, okay?
- Okay, okay.

14:11.280 --> 14:12.440
Can you just go?

14:12.585 --> 14:14.085
Yeah, I'll go.

14:14.086 --> 14:15.550
Oh. But what if you faint again?

14:15.560 --> 14:17.520
I'm fine.

14:17.940 --> 14:19.300
Oh. See that, girl?

14:19.620 --> 14:21.860
- See that?
- Okay, okay.

14:22.120 --> 14:23.440
Here.

14:23.829 --> 14:25.763
Look, you need to go to the doctor.

14:25.764 --> 14:29.220
Not too close.

14:29.702 --> 14:31.699
I'm fine. I know my body.

14:31.700 --> 14:33.940
Well, tell your body to stop fainting.

14:35.341 --> 14:37.400
Terrance, I really
appreciate your concern,

14:37.420 --> 14:38.840
- but I really need you to leave.
- Look, look, look.

14:38.860 --> 14:39.870
Here's what I'll do.

14:39.879 --> 14:40.879
I'll wait in the kitchen, all right?

14:40.880 --> 14:42.143
I won't even be near you.

14:42.144 --> 14:44.480
But someone has got to stay with you.

14:45.550 --> 14:46.820
I'll call Kendrick.

14:47.620 --> 14:50.400
- Is that right?
- Yes.

15:17.149 --> 15:18.283
Well, I was.

15:18.284 --> 15:20.579
Then why are you listening?

15:20.580 --> 15:24.480
You do know that kitchen
doesn't have any doors, right?

15:26.220 --> 15:29.560
You do know there is a door that
leads you to the outside, right?

15:30.360 --> 15:33.059
Okay.

15:33.060 --> 15:35.740
You ain't got to be so nasty about it.

15:36.068 --> 15:37.800
I'm not trying to be nasty,

15:37.820 --> 15:40.100
I just don't think you should be here.

15:40.105 --> 15:41.769
I mean, what is it...

No. No, no, no, no, no,
