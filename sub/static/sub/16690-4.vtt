WEBVTT

00:02.202 --> 00:03.103
It's been a year

00:03.170 --> 00:05.472
since Chef Ramsay
crisscrossed the country

00:05.539 --> 00:07.674
trying to save restaurants
in trouble.

00:07.774 --> 00:09.209
Get it together,
Marcelo.

00:09.276 --> 00:11.278
I want the nightmare
to be over.

00:11.345 --> 00:12.713
They may have asked
for his help,

00:12.779 --> 00:14.848
But that didn't stop them
from fighting with Gordon...

00:14.915 --> 00:16.350
Adele, what do you think?

00:16.416 --> 00:17.918
- I don't like it.
- And each other...

00:17.985 --> 00:20.220
Control.
Listen,
I can't control everything!

00:20.287 --> 00:21.922
Every step of the way.

00:21.989 --> 00:24.324
I need your smile.
I'll be right out.

00:24.391 --> 00:26.093
Now, one year later,

00:26.159 --> 00:29.363
Chef Ramsay is back
asking the tough questions.

00:29.429 --> 00:30.000
Do you still hate me?

00:30.000 --> 00:30.631
Do you still hate me?

00:30.697 --> 00:32.332
Is business going well?

00:32.399 --> 00:36.303
Is there any possibility
that you may get back together?

00:36.370 --> 00:38.205
Get ready for a night
of surprises...

00:38.272 --> 00:39.306
Oh.

00:39.373 --> 00:40.507
As Chef Ramsay finds out

00:40.574 --> 00:42.309
What happened to...
Disgusting.

00:42.376 --> 00:45.579
The restaurants he tried
to save.

00:45.646 --> 00:48.315
First we'll return
to Mojito's in Brooklyn...

00:48.382 --> 00:50.917
Do it, do it,
do it now!

00:50.984 --> 00:54.121
Owned by a former couple
who were at war with each other.

00:54.187 --> 00:56.923
Mojito's destroy our lives.

00:56.990 --> 00:58.892
And we'll check in
on the Junction,

00:58.959 --> 01:00.000
formerly known as Flamangos,
in rural New Jersey.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.495
formerly known as Flamangos,
in rural New Jersey.

01:01.561 --> 01:02.429
We know!

01:02.496 --> 01:03.930
Shut your mouth already!

01:03.997 --> 01:05.265
Run by a stubborn owner

01:05.332 --> 01:07.067
completely resistant
to change.

01:07.134 --> 01:08.535
I hate him.
You hate him?

01:08.602 --> 01:11.571
How can you be positive
about something you hate?

01:11.638 --> 01:13.640
And lastly, we'll get updated

01:13.707 --> 01:16.076
on Bazzini's
in Ridgewood, New Jersey.

01:16.143 --> 01:18.278
This is where Paul, the owner,
fought with his staff...

01:18.345 --> 01:19.880
Why do you have to make it
so difficult for?

01:19.946 --> 01:21.481
What the
you want from me?

01:21.548 --> 01:23.483
And did little
to impress Chef Ramsay.

01:23.550 --> 01:26.953
Whether you like it or not,
you have given up.

01:27.020 --> 01:29.890
Tonight
we will see it all.

01:29.956 --> 01:30.000
Kata!

01:30.000 --> 01:31.158
Kata!

01:31.224 --> 01:32.893
Who is living the dream,

01:32.959 --> 01:34.594
and who turned their kitchen
back into a nightmare?

01:34.661 --> 01:35.996
Oh, come on.

01:36.063 --> 01:37.597
Do you think
I'm gonna change now?

01:55.048 --> 01:57.217
Last year, my team and I
worked tirelessly

01:57.284 --> 01:59.720
across the country
turning restaurants around.

01:59.752 --> 02:00.000
Tonight we'll let you in
on how they're doing.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.988
Tonight we'll let you in
on how they're doing.

02:02.055 --> 02:03.923
Before that,
let's take a look back

02:03.990 --> 02:07.093
at what happened
when I first arrived at Mojito.

02:08.294 --> 02:10.563
Brooklyn is a hip,
trendy,

02:10.630 --> 02:12.198
diverse borough of New York.

02:12.265 --> 02:14.834
It's the perfect place
for a Cuban restaurant,

02:14.901 --> 02:17.437
unless that restaurant
happens to be called Mojito...

02:17.503 --> 02:20.973
Run by a divorced couple
at war with each other.

02:21.040 --> 02:22.975
Get the rice.
You're right there.
Yes, we are on it.

02:23.042 --> 02:24.544
Marcelo,
why don't you listen to me?

02:24.610 --> 02:26.245
Kata runs the front
of the restaurant.

02:26.312 --> 02:27.780
Marcelo runs the kitchen.

02:27.847 --> 02:28.915
Kata!

02:28.981 --> 02:30.000
But they spend most

02:30.000 --> 02:30.116
But they spend most

02:30.183 --> 02:31.551
of their time
running their mouths.

02:31.617 --> 02:33.886
Let me finish my way
in my way.

02:36.456 --> 02:38.691
Do it, do it,
do it now!

02:38.758 --> 02:40.193
What a mess.

02:40.259 --> 02:41.661
Seven years
in the business

02:41.728 --> 02:43.062
and all they have
to show for it

02:43.129 --> 02:46.265
was a failed marriage
and a huge mountain of debt.

02:47.266 --> 02:48.201
Zero.

02:48.267 --> 02:51.871
Mojito's destroy our lives.

02:54.307 --> 02:55.508
Sorry.

02:55.575 --> 02:56.809
When I first walked in,

02:56.876 --> 02:59.712
I knew straightaway
I had my work cut out.

02:59.779 --> 03:00.000
Real interesting decor,
yeah.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.414
Real interesting decor,
yeah.

03:01.481 --> 03:03.983
It's almost
like a sort of garage sale

03:04.050 --> 03:05.518
gone wrong.

03:05.585 --> 03:08.421
The toxic relationship
between Kata and Marcelo...

03:08.488 --> 03:10.156
Thank you very much.

03:10.223 --> 03:11.958
Poisoned everything at Mojito,
even the food.

03:12.024 --> 03:13.593
These are so salty.

03:13.659 --> 03:15.261
You'd need six mojitos

03:15.328 --> 03:16.963
before you start eating
six spoons of that.

03:17.029 --> 03:17.997
You're right.

03:18.064 --> 03:19.832
They're disgusting.

03:19.899 --> 03:21.200
Excuse me.
Let me take this back.

03:21.267 --> 03:24.103
Marcelo, the beans--
salty as hell.

03:24.170 --> 03:25.972
Throw it out!

03:26.038 --> 03:27.974
Get it together, Marcelo.
Control!

03:28.040 --> 03:29.542
Listen,
I can't control everything!

03:31.310 --> 03:32.678
Take a spoon,
and you taste everything.

03:32.745 --> 03:33.813
I'm gonna taste,
but listen--

03:33.880 --> 03:35.281
No, they're salty.
throw them out.

03:35.348 --> 03:36.983
Exchange them
for new ones.

03:39.018 --> 03:40.720
Instead of arguing,
do it, do it, do it.

03:40.820 --> 03:42.221
Bitch.

03:43.723 --> 03:46.692
Let me just tell you something--
lunch was a disaster.

03:46.759 --> 03:48.995
I could hear a lot of shouting.
Is that normal?

03:49.061 --> 03:50.463
That's all we hear
every day...

03:50.563 --> 03:52.165
Every single day.

03:52.231 --> 03:55.234
Kata's always pushing me.
Checking
your performance.

03:55.301 --> 03:57.236
You're not my boss.

03:57.303 --> 03:58.604
Maybe they were
really nervous.

03:58.671 --> 04:00.000
So when I came back
for dinner service...

04:00.000 --> 04:00.039
So when I came back
for dinner service...

04:00.106 --> 04:01.808
Hi. How are you?
I kept an open mind.

04:01.874 --> 04:05.878
Unfortunately,
things were no different.

04:05.945 --> 04:08.281
It actually got worse.

04:08.347 --> 04:09.849
Who made this?
You guys should know better.

04:09.916 --> 04:12.351
How can you allow food
to come out like that nasty?

04:12.418 --> 04:14.454
Negative. Negative.

04:14.520 --> 04:17.457
It was, like, soggy.
No, not crispy.

04:17.523 --> 04:19.492
It was soggy.
It's supposed to be nicer.

04:19.559 --> 04:20.993
Honestly,
after all that fighting,

04:21.060 --> 04:22.428
I was getting a headache.

04:22.495 --> 04:24.464
So I decided to go downstairs

04:24.530 --> 04:25.865
and take a good look
around in storage.

04:25.932 --> 04:28.201
What I found
was absolutely shocking.

04:28.267 --> 04:30.000
That is what you call
dry chicken.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.137
That is what you call
dry chicken.

04:31.204 --> 04:33.539
There must be thousands
and thousands of dollars' worth

04:33.606 --> 04:35.741
of food here.

04:35.808 --> 04:37.376
After the last
unhappy customer left...

04:37.443 --> 04:39.245
We'll never
come here again.

04:39.312 --> 04:40.980
I then decided
to call a meeting

04:41.047 --> 04:43.082
and really give them
a big wake-up call.

04:44.217 --> 04:45.985
I've never seen

04:46.052 --> 04:49.055
such waste
in my entire life.

04:49.155 --> 04:50.456
There's seven of these...

04:51.991 --> 04:52.859
Down there.

04:52.959 --> 04:54.460
Seven.

04:54.527 --> 04:58.531
This is rapidly shutting down

04:58.598 --> 05:00.000
the restaurant.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.067
the restaurant.

05:01.133 --> 05:02.401
Mojito was a mess,

05:02.468 --> 05:04.337
and nothing was gonna change
until Kata

05:04.403 --> 05:07.507
and Marcelo really put
their differences aside.

05:07.573 --> 05:10.042
The next morning,
I pulled them each aside

05:10.109 --> 05:11.878
to have a real heart-to-heart
with them.

05:11.944 --> 05:13.479
The restaurant's suffering
on the back

05:13.546 --> 05:15.114
of both of you
constantly hurting each other.

05:15.181 --> 05:16.415
And it's so sad.

05:16.482 --> 05:17.583
It's embarrassing.

05:17.650 --> 05:19.352
Do you think it's time
that one of you

05:19.418 --> 05:21.888
says good-bye
to the business?

05:21.954 --> 05:23.890
I think it would be
very healthy.

05:23.956 --> 05:25.491
How important
is the business for you?

05:25.558 --> 05:26.626
It's everything for me.

05:26.692 --> 05:28.628
The person
that I was married to,

05:28.694 --> 05:30.000
that person
doesn't exist anymore.

05:30.000 --> 05:30.463
that person
doesn't exist anymore.

05:30.530 --> 05:31.631
He's gone.

05:33.266 --> 05:34.467
And I have to move on.

05:34.534 --> 05:36.302
So I'm taking it
on my business,

05:36.369 --> 05:39.672
because that's all
I have left.

05:39.739 --> 05:43.009
Whatever it takes,
I'll go to the end

05:43.075 --> 05:44.877
until I feel there is
nothing else

05:44.944 --> 05:46.345
that I can do.

05:46.412 --> 05:48.247
I'm committed.
Okay.

05:48.314 --> 05:50.016
Thank you.
Come here.

05:50.082 --> 05:52.285
Stand strong.

05:52.351 --> 05:54.887
Finally there was hope
for the future.

05:54.954 --> 05:57.223
With that in mind,
my team and I spent all night

05:57.290 --> 05:59.625
renovating Mojito's.

05:59.692 --> 06:00.000
Welcome to Mojito's.
The new Mojito's, yes?

06:00.000 --> 06:03.496
Welcome to Mojito's.
The new Mojito's, yes?

06:03.563 --> 06:05.398
Doesn't it feel
twice as big?

06:05.464 --> 06:06.966
Hello, Cuba.

06:07.033 --> 06:08.367
This is amazing.

06:08.434 --> 06:09.602
First thing
that's gone missing

06:09.669 --> 06:11.337
are the 500 bottles

06:11.404 --> 06:14.140
that were stopping
all that natural light.

06:14.206 --> 06:16.509
Oh, that's beautiful.
Take a look

06:16.576 --> 06:17.944
at where your bottles
have gone.

06:20.212 --> 06:21.147
Kata, what do you think?

06:21.213 --> 06:22.582
This is amazing.

06:22.648 --> 06:24.050
Today is the beginning

06:24.116 --> 06:26.419
of a new chapter
inside Mojito's.

06:26.485 --> 06:27.787
Come here.
Thank you.

06:27.853 --> 06:28.955
You little firecracker.

06:29.021 --> 06:30.000
Then I unveiled

06:30.000 --> 06:30.690
Then I unveiled

06:30.756 --> 06:32.325
the new menu.

06:32.391 --> 06:34.760
Look at the difference
in the portion size.

06:34.827 --> 06:37.863
It's a lot less,
but, visually, it's beautiful.

06:37.930 --> 06:40.232
For relaunch night,
Kata and Marcelo decided

06:40.299 --> 06:42.101
to work the front
of the house together...

06:42.168 --> 06:43.436
Follow me this way, guys.

06:43.502 --> 06:45.471
And leave the kitchen
to Eduardo.

06:45.538 --> 06:47.406
Are you convinced
you can do it?
Yeah.

06:47.473 --> 06:48.507
Cuban sandwich, okay.

06:49.742 --> 06:51.644
What came back?
This plate because

06:51.711 --> 06:52.778
they order
a Cuban sandwich.

06:52.845 --> 06:53.846
Not the pork?
Not the pork.

06:53.913 --> 06:55.081
Look at me now.

06:55.147 --> 06:56.849
You've got to call out
the  orders.

06:56.916 --> 06:58.517
Eduardo
was getting flustered.

06:58.584 --> 07:00.000
Orders were coming back
to the kitchen.

07:00.000 --> 07:00.353
Orders were coming back
to the kitchen.

07:00.419 --> 07:03.422
Guys, F5 is missing a Cuban.

07:04.657 --> 07:06.525
Bloody hell.

07:06.592 --> 07:11.263
The new Mojito was starting
to look a lot like the old one.

07:11.330 --> 07:12.398
Then Marcelo...

07:12.465 --> 07:13.966
I have to do something.

07:14.033 --> 07:16.068
Jumped straight back into
the kitchen and took charge.

07:16.135 --> 07:17.103
We concentrating now.

07:17.169 --> 07:19.338
Pescado marinero,
ropa vieja,

07:19.405 --> 07:20.539
arroz con pollo,
white meat only,

07:20.606 --> 07:21.707
churrasco pork.

07:21.774 --> 07:23.376
Brilliant.
Thank you.

07:23.442 --> 07:24.610
My buddy.

07:24.677 --> 07:27.446
Kata and me are working together
well again.

07:27.513 --> 07:29.415
How is everything here?
Delicious.

07:29.482 --> 07:30.000
They loved everything.

07:30.000 --> 07:30.483
They loved everything.

07:30.549 --> 07:31.984
Yeah, baby.
Yeah.

07:35.421 --> 07:36.489
Tonight wasn't perfect.

07:36.555 --> 07:37.790
But I did see one thing

07:37.857 --> 07:39.759
that I haven't witnessed,

07:39.825 --> 07:41.060
and that was teamwork.

07:41.127 --> 07:42.695
Well done.

07:42.762 --> 07:44.797
It feels great
to see Marcelo smile.

07:44.864 --> 07:45.898
It just...

07:45.965 --> 07:48.534
Sort of
right in my heart.

07:48.601 --> 07:50.803
I need you
to continue.

07:50.870 --> 07:53.005
You are the half
of that.

07:53.072 --> 07:54.607
I'm gonna do everything
that it takes

07:54.774 --> 07:55.841
to make it work.

07:55.908 --> 07:57.843
You guys work well together.

07:57.910 --> 07:59.278
Tonight proved that.

07:59.345 --> 08:00.000
Don't stop.
You'd be mad to.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.514
Don't stop.
You'd be mad to.

08:01.580 --> 08:03.349
Come here,
my darling.

08:03.416 --> 08:04.417
Ay yi yi.

08:04.517 --> 08:05.718
Great scene.

08:09.588 --> 08:11.190
I'm back at Mojito

08:11.257 --> 08:12.491
in Brooklyn, New York City.

08:12.558 --> 08:13.893
Now, if you came here
last year,

08:13.959 --> 08:16.362
you would be served dreadful
food by bickering owners.

08:16.429 --> 08:17.763
We made a lot of changes

08:17.830 --> 08:19.632
and brought the owners
finally together.

08:19.699 --> 08:21.233
I'm just hoping it paid off.

08:21.300 --> 08:23.169
We're about to find out.

08:23.235 --> 08:25.037
Up next...

08:25.104 --> 08:27.707
Have the ex-lovers patched up
their differences...

08:27.773 --> 08:28.974
Is she treating you
like a partner,

08:29.041 --> 08:30.000
not like
you're her bitch?

08:30.000 --> 08:31.377
not like
you're her bitch?

08:31.444 --> 08:34.280
Or are they driving Mojito's
back into bankruptcy?

08:34.380 --> 08:35.381
I don't care.

08:36.882 --> 08:39.852
Then Flamangos was Chef Ramsay's
toughest assignment.

08:39.919 --> 08:41.754
- That's not cooking.
- That's dog.

08:41.854 --> 08:43.055
Remember the outbursts...

08:43.122 --> 08:44.557
Shut your mouth already!

08:44.657 --> 08:46.025
The fire?

08:46.092 --> 08:48.728
How can you be positive
about something you hate?

08:48.794 --> 08:50.329
Hate, hate.

08:50.396 --> 08:51.764
Now get ready for round two

08:51.831 --> 08:53.466
of Gordon versus Adele.

08:53.532 --> 08:55.701
Oh, my God!

08:55.768 --> 08:56.902
It's the rematch,

08:57.002 --> 08:59.505
Coming up on...

09:03.543 --> 09:04.844
Mojito, a Cuban restaurant
in Brooklyn,

09:04.911 --> 09:06.312
was run by a former couple

09:06.379 --> 09:08.714
who seemed more interested
in feuding...

09:08.941 --> 09:10.242
Listen,
I can't control everything!

09:10.309 --> 09:11.644
Than the restaurant.

09:11.711 --> 09:13.245
Go out here.
I'm not going out.

09:13.312 --> 09:15.981
Go out here.
Go out of my kitchen now.

09:16.048 --> 09:17.149
It was a big challenge,

09:17.216 --> 09:19.285
but Chef Ramsay
revamped the restaurant

09:19.352 --> 09:21.721
and unified Kata
and Marcelo.

09:21.821 --> 09:23.055
Now, one year later,

09:23.122 --> 09:25.391
is Mojito's enjoying
peace and prosperity,

09:25.425 --> 09:27.627
or is it back
to its old bickering ways?

09:29.395 --> 09:30.563
Last time I was at Mojito,

09:30.630 --> 09:31.474
The food was dreadful,

09:31.474 --> 09:31.698
The food was dreadful,

09:31.764 --> 09:33.299
and the business
was going down the tubes.

09:33.366 --> 09:35.034
Nothing was going to change
unless Kata and Marcelo

09:35.101 --> 09:36.035
stopped all their fighting.

09:36.102 --> 09:37.170
It took a lot of tears,

09:37.236 --> 09:39.238
but they finally became
an amazing team.

09:39.305 --> 09:41.074
I just hope
they've kept it up.

09:44.510 --> 09:45.745
Hello.
Kata, how are you?

09:45.812 --> 09:46.913
Good to see you.
How are you?

09:46.979 --> 09:48.281
Very well.
How are you?

09:48.315 --> 09:50.283
Welcome back to Mojito.
We're wonderful.

09:50.350 --> 09:51.818
Sounds great.
Atmosphere is up.

09:51.885 --> 09:54.821
Seeing Gordon was like seeing
an old friend.

09:54.888 --> 09:56.923
He has a very special place
in my heart

09:56.990 --> 09:58.191
and Mojito's heart.

10:00.493 --> 10:01.474
Silly question,
because it looks busy,

10:01.474 --> 10:02.295
Silly question,
because it looks busy,

10:02.361 --> 10:03.763
but how is business?
business is great.

10:03.829 --> 10:04.864
Um, where shall we sit?

10:04.930 --> 10:05.931
Here.
Okay, great.

10:05.998 --> 10:07.133
Great, great, great.

10:07.199 --> 10:08.634
Good to see you.

10:08.701 --> 10:10.102
My God, I forgot
how glamorous you were.

10:10.202 --> 10:11.704
Yeah.

10:11.771 --> 10:13.539
Now, it's working
together professionally?
Yes.

10:13.606 --> 10:14.940
Who's in control?
Who's wearing the trousers--

10:15.041 --> 10:16.542
you or him?

10:16.609 --> 10:19.178
We both do.
It's a give and take, you know.

10:19.245 --> 10:21.781
Now we're really partners,
and we're really working out...

10:21.847 --> 10:24.483
Brilliant.
And respecting
each other

10:24.550 --> 10:26.786
and respecting each other's work
and commitment.

10:26.852 --> 10:28.587
And we're really committed
to make it work.

10:28.654 --> 10:30.156
Business is up
by how much?

10:30.222 --> 10:31.474
30%.
That's brilliant.

10:31.474 --> 10:31.924
30%.
That's brilliant.

10:31.991 --> 10:33.559
Business has gotten
a lot better.

10:33.626 --> 10:35.961
We paid off half
of our debt.

10:36.028 --> 10:37.863
So it looks a lot better.

10:37.930 --> 10:41.000
Six months, we are estimated
to be out of debt, debt-free.

10:41.067 --> 10:42.802
I mean,
that's amazing.
Yes.

10:42.868 --> 10:44.170
Marcelo--
where is he?

10:44.236 --> 10:45.638
He's in the kitchen.

10:45.705 --> 10:47.506
I'm so excited to come back.
You know that?

10:47.573 --> 10:48.808
All right.
I'll go
and surprise him.

10:48.874 --> 10:49.875
Okay.
Nice to see you.
Thank you.

10:52.845 --> 10:55.815
Chef, hello.

10:55.881 --> 10:57.283
Seor!
Good to see you.

10:57.350 --> 10:59.785
Me too, my man.
You look great.
You look happy.

10:59.852 --> 11:01.474
Yes.
Not just 'cause I'm here.

11:01.474 --> 11:01.520
Yes.
Not just 'cause I'm here.

11:01.587 --> 11:03.255
You're like this
on a daily basis--

11:03.322 --> 11:05.591
motivated, fired up,
and ready to go, yeah?

11:07.193 --> 11:10.062
Your relationship with Kata
is on a professional front.

11:10.129 --> 11:13.399
In the professional way,
I'm more relaxed.

11:13.466 --> 11:14.767
Is she treating you like
a partner,

11:14.834 --> 11:15.935
not like
you're her bitch?

11:16.001 --> 11:17.403
Just serve the rice.
Serve the rice.

11:17.470 --> 11:18.771
Marcelo,
why don't you listen to me?

11:18.838 --> 11:21.273
She's showing you
respect?

11:21.374 --> 11:23.976
Purchasing.

11:24.043 --> 11:26.779
There must be thousands
and thousands of dollars' worth

11:26.846 --> 11:28.147
of food here.

11:28.214 --> 11:29.215
Are you buying
the stuff now?

11:29.281 --> 11:31.183
- Yeah.
- Where is it?

11:31.250 --> 11:31.474
Want to check?
Yeah, I want
to have a check.

11:31.474 --> 11:32.785
Want to check?
Yeah, I want
to have a check.

11:32.852 --> 11:34.854
Yeah, please.
After you.

11:34.920 --> 11:37.089
How clean this is
down here.

11:37.156 --> 11:39.125
My God.

11:39.191 --> 11:40.693
Now, these fridges are full.

11:40.760 --> 11:43.195
I was kind of afraid
because I have my fridge

11:43.262 --> 11:45.598
with a lot of stock.

11:45.664 --> 11:49.635
But this is because my business
is coming up a lot.

11:49.702 --> 11:51.003
Listen,
not just the labels,

11:51.070 --> 11:54.073
the dates,
the plastic wrap.

11:54.140 --> 11:55.608
Everything's
so well organized.

11:55.674 --> 11:57.410
Brilliant. Brilliant.
Brilliant.

11:57.476 --> 12:00.012
Last time I came down here,
it was in a mess.

12:00.079 --> 12:01.474
Right, I'm hungry.
What do you recommend for lunch?

12:01.474 --> 12:02.348
Right, I'm hungry.
What do you recommend for lunch?

12:02.448 --> 12:04.083
I'm gonna surprise you.

12:04.150 --> 12:05.351
I like your surprises.

12:08.788 --> 12:10.556
How was your visit
downstairs?

12:10.623 --> 12:11.924
Brilliant.
Clean down there.

12:11.991 --> 12:13.592
Impressive, right?
The good news is,

12:13.659 --> 12:16.328
he sounds like he's got
his passion back, and he seems

12:16.395 --> 12:18.130
a lot more relaxed--
less, uh--

12:18.197 --> 12:20.065
less aggressive
and jumpy?
yeah.

12:20.132 --> 12:21.200
We work on that.

12:21.267 --> 12:23.836
Okay. Wow.
Camarones tropicales.

12:23.903 --> 12:27.606
That's, like, the kind
of flavors that I like to eat.

12:27.673 --> 12:28.774
Fantastic.

12:28.874 --> 12:30.910
That's delicious.

12:30.976 --> 12:31.474
What happens
when an argument takes place,

12:31.474 --> 12:32.678
What happens
when an argument takes place,

12:32.745 --> 12:34.013
and you're not happy
with Marcelo,

12:34.079 --> 12:36.081
and he's not happy with you,
and you want to let it go?

12:36.148 --> 12:38.384
We call our peacemaker,
which is my mom.

12:38.451 --> 12:40.686
She works hand-to-hand
with Marcelo.

12:40.753 --> 12:41.821
Mami.
This is your mom?

12:41.887 --> 12:43.923
Nice to meet you.
Likewise.

12:43.989 --> 12:46.425
How are you?
My goodness me.
Sit down, please.

12:46.492 --> 12:47.827
That's my mom.

12:47.893 --> 12:49.228
Wow, wow, wow.
So this has been

12:49.295 --> 12:50.663
the secret success
behind Mojito?

12:50.729 --> 12:52.097
Yes.

12:52.164 --> 12:55.968
Does she understand the level
of your stubbornness?

12:58.204 --> 12:59.805
She does. Yeah.

12:59.872 --> 13:01.106
I don't need
to translate that.

13:01.173 --> 13:01.474
I don't know why Gordon said
I'm stubborn.

13:01.474 --> 13:03.275
I don't know why Gordon said
I'm stubborn.

13:03.342 --> 13:04.944
If I want to scream,
I can do it.

13:05.010 --> 13:06.045
I'm the boss here.

13:06.111 --> 13:07.947
Remember who I am.

13:08.013 --> 13:09.114
Here he is.

13:09.181 --> 13:10.649
Oh, food is here.
Sit down.

13:10.716 --> 13:11.851
Sit down.
I want to talk to you.

13:11.917 --> 13:14.520
This time, I'm really,
really nervous,

13:14.587 --> 13:16.755
because I know

13:16.822 --> 13:20.593
he's a really, really
high standard.

13:20.659 --> 13:21.727
Delicious food,
by the way.

13:21.794 --> 13:22.962
I mean,
really delicious.

13:23.028 --> 13:25.331
He liked it.

13:25.397 --> 13:28.367
He really enjoyed the food,
so great.

13:28.434 --> 13:30.569
Here's the thing--
to get rid of your debts

13:30.636 --> 13:31.474
by 50% in the first 12 months
of training

13:31.474 --> 13:32.438
by 50% in the first 12 months
of training

13:32.505 --> 13:34.974
in amongst a recession
is extraordinary.

13:35.040 --> 13:36.675
99% of a breakdown
in relationships

13:36.742 --> 13:38.544
is always
financially related.

13:38.677 --> 13:40.312
With the pressure gone,

13:40.379 --> 13:43.482
is there any possibility
that you may get back together?

13:43.549 --> 13:46.752
Gordon, he tries. He plays
our relationship therapist.

13:46.819 --> 13:49.355
You look
so happy together.

13:49.421 --> 13:52.291
When Gordon Ramsay come here,
we feel like, uh...

13:57.263 --> 13:59.265
But the heart
and the feelings

13:59.331 --> 14:01.474
are completely
different ways.

14:01.474 --> 14:02.735
are completely
different ways.

14:02.801 --> 14:05.104
What went wrong
when you got back together?

14:11.377 --> 14:12.912
Last time I came,

14:12.978 --> 14:14.346
what was the worst moment?

14:14.413 --> 14:16.181
When things were, like,
out of control.

14:16.248 --> 14:17.416
Salty as hell.

14:17.483 --> 14:18.651
Throw it out!

14:18.717 --> 14:21.654
My worst moment
is when you come with a lot

14:21.720 --> 14:23.455
of chicken and avocado.

14:25.191 --> 14:26.559
You've got enough food
down there

14:26.625 --> 14:28.594
to serve a banquet
of 5,000.

14:29.962 --> 14:31.474
I'm very proud of you both.
You deserve more.

14:31.474 --> 14:31.897
I'm very proud of you both.
You deserve more.

14:31.964 --> 14:34.333
So just continue.

14:34.400 --> 14:36.268
One step at a time,
you know?

14:36.335 --> 14:38.170
Yes. Good to see
all three of you.

14:38.237 --> 14:39.472
Wonderful.

14:39.538 --> 14:42.341
If Ramsay didn't come
to Mojito,

14:42.408 --> 14:43.876
we'd probably be
out of business.

14:43.943 --> 14:45.911
Take care.
It was our pleasure.

14:45.978 --> 14:48.180
We didn't have
a clear vision.
Thank you.

14:48.247 --> 14:50.716
The most value I learn
from Ramsay

14:50.783 --> 14:54.119
is I would recover
the passion for my job.

14:54.186 --> 14:56.188
Thank you.
Ciao.

14:59.959 --> 15:01.393
I'm so proud of these two.

15:01.460 --> 15:01.474
Honestly, they managed
to turn around a dying business

15:01.474 --> 15:03.462
Honestly, they managed
to turn around a dying business

15:03.529 --> 15:04.630
in the middle of a recession.

15:04.697 --> 15:05.931
They're out of debt,

15:05.998 --> 15:07.600
and they've managed to move on
from the past.

15:07.666 --> 15:09.168
Right now
the future for Mojito's

15:09.235 --> 15:11.670
looks very,
very bright indeed.

15:11.737 --> 15:13.939
Great news.

15:14.006 --> 15:15.708
Coming up...

15:15.774 --> 15:18.143
We go back to
Whitehouse Station, New Jersey,

15:18.210 --> 15:19.912
where Adele, the owner,
battled with her staff...

15:20.012 --> 15:21.413
Stop bugging me!

15:21.480 --> 15:23.282
And disagreed
with Chef Ramsay.

15:23.349 --> 15:25.017
Adele, what do you think?
I don't like it.

15:25.084 --> 15:26.852
Now, one year later...

15:26.919 --> 15:29.321
- Oh!
- Has she embraced the changes?

15:29.388 --> 15:31.474
Are you nicer
to your staff now?

15:31.474 --> 15:31.557
Are you nicer
to your staff now?

15:31.624 --> 15:32.858
Am I nicer to you?

15:32.925 --> 15:34.927
Or is this kitchen nightmare

15:34.994 --> 15:37.296
still spinning
out of control?

15:37.363 --> 15:40.533
And later, remember Paul
from Bazzini's?
I'm miserable.

15:40.599 --> 15:42.401
I don't want to get out of bed
in the morning.

15:42.468 --> 15:44.603
You'll be shocked
to see what happens

15:44.670 --> 15:46.138
when Gordon returns.
Oh, no.

15:46.205 --> 15:48.674
That's all coming up on...

15:53.915 --> 15:55.716
Whitehouse Station, New Jersey,

15:55.783 --> 15:59.087
is a quiet commuter town
one hour outside Manhattan.

15:59.154 --> 16:01.456
Everything was just
so damn quiet and peaceful...

16:02.457 --> 16:04.760
That is,
until you got near Flamangos.

16:04.826 --> 16:06.194
We have big problems here.

16:06.261 --> 16:07.662
Girls!

16:07.729 --> 16:09.164
There was the owner, Adele,

16:09.231 --> 16:11.266
who was dead set
in her ways.

16:11.366 --> 16:13.402
Shut your mouth already!

16:13.602 --> 16:14.836
This was a family affair.

16:14.903 --> 16:16.371
Adele and her husband, Bill,

16:16.438 --> 16:18.507
had run successful restaurants
in the past.

16:18.573 --> 16:19.875
But they opened this one

16:19.941 --> 16:20.650
so they could work
with their daughter Cheryl.

16:20.650 --> 16:21.176
so they could work
with their daughter Cheryl.

16:21.243 --> 16:22.511
Chop-chop.

16:23.912 --> 16:25.614
My first stop on this trip

16:25.680 --> 16:26.948
was to Bill
and Adele's farmhouse.

16:27.015 --> 16:28.717
Yoo-hoo!

16:28.784 --> 16:30.318
Hello.
Hello.

16:30.385 --> 16:32.821
Now, do you just pop over
for a slice of cake?

16:32.888 --> 16:36.425
No. I live here.
You live here.

16:36.491 --> 16:37.426
Yes.

16:38.794 --> 16:41.263
How old are you?
I'm 42 years old.

16:42.998 --> 16:45.100
Same age as me.

16:45.167 --> 16:46.735
I left mum 24 years ago.

16:46.802 --> 16:50.472
What are you still
doing here?

16:50.539 --> 16:50.650
I haven't had a paycheck
in two years.

16:50.650 --> 16:53.008
I haven't had a paycheck
in two years.

16:53.075 --> 16:54.109
Right.

16:54.176 --> 16:55.844
I have to live home.

16:55.911 --> 16:58.814
It's pretty shocking
for a 42-year-old lady

16:58.880 --> 17:00.482
to still be living
at home.

17:01.550 --> 17:02.851
Wow.

17:02.918 --> 17:05.020
But even more shocking...

17:05.087 --> 17:06.521
Wow.

17:06.588 --> 17:07.589
Was the decor.

17:09.558 --> 17:11.126
Oh, my God.
It's like a zoo in here.

17:11.193 --> 17:12.594
Well, it is tropical.

17:12.661 --> 17:14.229
Who designed it?

17:14.296 --> 17:15.764
My daughter decorated it.

17:15.831 --> 17:19.234
How drunk was she when she put
the final sketches together?

17:19.301 --> 17:20.650
I could see we had plenty
of problems to fix at Flamangos,

17:20.650 --> 17:22.104
I could see we had plenty
of problems to fix at Flamangos,

17:22.170 --> 17:24.072
and I was really hoping
the food wasn't one of them.

17:25.974 --> 17:27.776
Fat chance.

17:27.843 --> 17:30.145
What is that thing?
Use a roof tile.

17:30.212 --> 17:31.546
We're eating it
from the tile?

17:31.646 --> 17:32.814
You'll love this.

17:34.616 --> 17:36.685
The toughest filet mignon
I've ever tasted

17:36.751 --> 17:38.019
in my entire life.

17:39.020 --> 17:40.522
I was pissed off.

17:40.589 --> 17:42.424
I went straight to the kitchen
to confront the chef, Bryan.

17:42.491 --> 17:43.925
Straight up,
would you eat it?

17:43.992 --> 17:45.427
No.

17:45.494 --> 17:46.962
You sent it to me.

17:47.062 --> 17:49.297
That's not cooking.

17:49.364 --> 17:50.650
That's dog.

17:50.650 --> 17:51.233
That's dog.

17:51.299 --> 17:53.935
That night I observed
dinner service,

17:54.002 --> 17:55.303
and it became so obvious

17:55.370 --> 17:57.105
as to why this restaurant
was failing--

17:57.172 --> 17:58.340
bad food...

17:59.741 --> 18:01.343
Slow service...

18:03.145 --> 18:05.714
And a very stubborn owner
who treated her customers

18:05.780 --> 18:07.716
and her staff like dogs.

18:07.782 --> 18:10.085
Shut your mouth already!

18:10.152 --> 18:11.753
Absolute crazy.

18:13.321 --> 18:14.489
And then there was poor Bill.

18:14.556 --> 18:15.657
Here I go.

18:16.992 --> 18:18.226
You got a 70-year-old man
going round

18:18.293 --> 18:19.528
and round
the dining room.

18:19.594 --> 18:20.650
He shouldn't be doing this
at this pace.

18:20.650 --> 18:21.396
He shouldn't be doing this
at this pace.

18:21.463 --> 18:23.231
From what I saw
at dinner service,

18:23.298 --> 18:25.834
I knew they had
to do something

18:25.901 --> 18:27.769
they'd never done before--

18:27.836 --> 18:30.138
have a staff meeting.

18:30.205 --> 18:33.074
Well, Isabelle,

18:33.141 --> 18:35.243
you're an excellent server,

18:35.310 --> 18:36.978
but you don't frickin' listen!

18:37.045 --> 18:39.314
I know what the
I'm doing.

18:39.381 --> 18:41.616
You don't know
when to shut up.

18:43.919 --> 18:45.220
The next morning,

18:45.287 --> 18:46.688
I wanted Bill
to get back in touch

18:46.755 --> 18:49.691
with something that really
made him successful in the past.

18:49.791 --> 18:50.650
What is your favorite dish
to cook?

18:50.650 --> 18:51.526
What is your favorite dish
to cook?

18:51.593 --> 18:52.460
My meat loaf.

18:52.527 --> 18:54.729
Tonight you're going
to cook that.

18:54.762 --> 18:56.430
I would never order meat loaf
out--never.

18:56.497 --> 18:58.399
Ay yi yi yi yi.

18:58.466 --> 19:00.334
Adele, the owner,
was fighting me

19:00.401 --> 19:02.336
every step of the way.

19:02.403 --> 19:05.439
That night the customers
really loved Bill's special.

19:07.041 --> 19:09.243
But the dishes
from the old menu bombed.

19:12.413 --> 19:14.615
Adele, they want
to speak with you.

19:14.682 --> 19:16.918
Okay, complaints,
what are they?

19:16.984 --> 19:18.119
It's dry.
Dry.
So you don't want it.

19:18.186 --> 19:19.520
Dry and overdone.

19:19.587 --> 19:20.650
Okay. Bastard.

19:20.650 --> 19:21.389
Okay. Bastard.

19:21.455 --> 19:22.890
The amazing thing is

19:22.957 --> 19:24.692
Even though the restaurant
was going under,

19:24.759 --> 19:27.228
everyone was still clinging on
to the old ways.

19:27.295 --> 19:29.230
That's when I knew
I'd have to do something

19:29.297 --> 19:30.898
really drastic.

19:30.965 --> 19:32.867
Everybody, stand up,

19:32.934 --> 19:35.570
grab a chair from
the dining room, and follow me.

19:35.636 --> 19:37.438
Let's go.

19:37.505 --> 19:39.273
- Oh, hold on.
- No!

19:39.340 --> 19:40.741
What do you mean "No"?

19:40.808 --> 19:42.276
That's Willy, my alligator.

19:42.343 --> 19:43.978
Trust me.
I need him.

19:44.045 --> 19:45.413
I want that alligator.

19:45.479 --> 19:48.149
Oh, my God.

19:48.216 --> 19:50.650
Adele, the only way I know

19:50.650 --> 19:50.651
Adele, the only way I know

19:50.718 --> 19:52.119
When I leave

19:52.186 --> 19:54.322
that the tropics
aren't gonna creep back in

19:54.388 --> 19:56.057
is to burn them.

19:59.460 --> 20:00.294
Ah!

20:00.394 --> 20:01.896
Look at that.

20:04.031 --> 20:06.534
Anyone for cooked alligator?

20:08.903 --> 20:10.137
It's all right,
Mom.

20:10.204 --> 20:12.106
Sometimes it's hard
to say good-bye to the past.

20:12.173 --> 20:13.741
You know that?

20:13.808 --> 20:15.676
It's all right, baby.

20:20.881 --> 20:23.084
That night
my team and I went to work

20:23.150 --> 20:25.620
Making one
of the most drastic changes

20:25.686 --> 20:27.788
ever in the history
of Kitchen Nightmares.

20:27.855 --> 20:29.423
Welcome to the...

20:29.490 --> 20:30.524
Junction.

20:32.627 --> 20:34.495
Look at the size
of this place!

20:34.562 --> 20:36.697
Oh, my God!

20:36.764 --> 20:38.699
Adele, what do you think?
I don't like it.

20:38.766 --> 20:40.234
You don't like it?
I hate blue.

20:40.301 --> 20:41.602
Unbelievable.

20:41.669 --> 20:43.738
This was, beyond any shadow
of a doubt,

20:43.804 --> 20:47.241
one of the most stubborn owners
I've ever worked with.

20:47.375 --> 20:48.943
I hate it.

20:49.010 --> 20:50.650
How can you be positive
about something you hate?

20:50.650 --> 20:51.279
How can you be positive
about something you hate?

20:51.345 --> 20:52.613
Ugly.

20:52.680 --> 20:55.082
Hate, hate, hate.

20:55.149 --> 20:57.018
I didn't think it could get
any worse.

20:57.084 --> 20:59.387
But then Adele was always full
of surprises.

20:59.453 --> 21:01.255
What do you think
of the menu?

21:01.322 --> 21:04.592
I mean,
this is very limited.

21:04.626 --> 21:07.228
I'm trying so hard
to help here.
Yeah.

21:07.261 --> 21:08.929
You have
to embrace change,

21:08.996 --> 21:11.031
because if you're not
gonna embrace change,

21:11.098 --> 21:12.466
do yourself a favor,

21:12.533 --> 21:14.602
shut the shop and retire.

21:17.104 --> 21:18.939
Then I unveiled
the new dishes,

21:19.006 --> 21:20.650
and everyone was so excited,

21:20.650 --> 21:20.708
and everyone was so excited,

21:20.774 --> 21:24.245
except for the one woman
I called madam grumpy.

21:24.345 --> 21:26.113
Tastes like a fish.

21:26.180 --> 21:27.181
Ugh.

21:29.917 --> 21:30.951
It was relaunch night,

21:31.018 --> 21:32.453
And I was really praying

21:32.519 --> 21:34.255
Adele's negativity
wouldn't rub off

21:34.321 --> 21:35.689
on the rest of her staff.

21:35.756 --> 21:38.559
I need your smile.
I'll be right out.

21:42.630 --> 21:45.833
Good.
First customers are here.

21:45.899 --> 21:48.202
This looks like a place that'd
be fun to come to every day.

21:48.269 --> 21:49.370
Really?

21:49.436 --> 21:50.650
It's open.
It's, um, inviting.

21:50.650 --> 21:51.605
It's open.
It's, um, inviting.

21:51.672 --> 21:53.841
Where is madam grumpy?
Where is she?

21:53.907 --> 21:55.776
I caught her arguing
with customers

21:55.843 --> 21:57.811
Who liked the changes.

21:57.878 --> 22:00.814
It's nice and bright.
It's too bright.

22:00.881 --> 22:02.082
Already
you don't believe in it.

22:02.149 --> 22:03.250
Your negativity's

22:03.317 --> 22:04.285
gonna rub off
on your staff,

22:04.351 --> 22:05.619
it's gonna rub off
on your daughter,

22:05.686 --> 22:06.854
and the customers
will be feeling it.

22:06.954 --> 22:07.921
I don't know.

22:07.988 --> 22:09.156
I need
to get out of here.

22:10.424 --> 22:11.892
Unbelievable.

22:11.959 --> 22:13.727
Relaunch night
was about to go up in flames,

22:13.794 --> 22:15.896
so I turned to Bill
for some help.

22:15.963 --> 22:17.898
She's our first point
of contact.

22:17.965 --> 22:19.400
Yeah.
Do me a favor

22:19.466 --> 22:20.650
and just ask her to put
a smile on that face.

22:20.650 --> 22:22.336
and just ask her to put
a smile on that face.

22:22.436 --> 22:24.138
Okay, I will do that.

22:25.506 --> 22:26.907
How you doing?
Okay?

22:26.974 --> 22:28.709
I'm scared.
I'm so nervous.

22:28.776 --> 22:29.777
Don't be scared.

22:29.877 --> 22:32.513
Smile. Smile.

22:32.579 --> 22:35.082
There you go.

22:35.149 --> 22:36.417
Do you like
Bill's meat loaf?

22:36.483 --> 22:38.786
Yes.
Oh, yeah.
Good.

22:38.852 --> 22:40.321
Is she lightening up?
Yes.

22:40.387 --> 22:42.923
I told you,
she's a pain in the ass.

22:42.990 --> 22:45.459
She is.
Yeah, but you didn't tell me
on what scale

22:45.526 --> 22:48.629
of a pain in the ass she is
out of 10.
oh, she's 11. 11.

22:48.696 --> 22:49.596
Oh, good.

22:49.663 --> 22:50.650
This is wonderful.
Thank you.

22:50.650 --> 22:51.165
This is wonderful.
Thank you.

22:51.231 --> 22:52.633
Everybody's happy.

22:54.034 --> 22:55.869
A big thank you
to the queen.

22:55.936 --> 22:58.272
I'm serious.

22:58.339 --> 22:59.573
I will be back,

22:59.640 --> 23:01.208
and I'll take
great pleasure

23:01.275 --> 23:03.210
in witnessing the success.

23:03.277 --> 23:05.245
And by the time
I get back, madam,

23:05.312 --> 23:06.613
I want you moved out
of that house.

23:06.680 --> 23:08.248
Yes?

23:08.315 --> 23:09.717
Promise me.
I promise.

23:09.783 --> 23:11.518
Okay, good.

23:14.988 --> 23:17.291
I'm back at the Junction in
Whitehouse Station, New Jersey.

23:17.358 --> 23:19.293
This restaurant was known
for three things--

23:19.360 --> 23:20.650
bad food, wacky decor,
and an owner,

23:20.650 --> 23:22.196
bad food, wacky decor,
and an owner,

23:22.262 --> 23:23.864
the most stubborn this side
of the Mississippi.

23:23.931 --> 23:25.265
We made a lot of changes,

23:25.332 --> 23:27.201
and I'm dying to find out
if they're successful.

23:27.267 --> 23:28.902
Up next, sparks fly...

23:28.969 --> 23:31.538
Oh, my God!

23:31.605 --> 23:33.807
When Gordon and Adele
face off again.

23:33.874 --> 23:35.876
You have not changed
one little bit.

23:35.943 --> 23:38.245
Then we are going back
to Bazzini's,

23:38.312 --> 23:40.381
where a burnt-out owner
took his frustration out

23:40.447 --> 23:41.782
on his staff...

23:41.849 --> 23:42.950
So let me demo
a chicken milanese

23:43.050 --> 23:44.284
for the 400th  time.

23:44.351 --> 23:45.486
Don't push it, Paul.

23:45.552 --> 23:47.354
And infuriated Chef Ramsay.

23:47.421 --> 23:48.789
We need to  cook!

23:48.856 --> 23:50.650
Now, a year later,
we're about to find out

23:50.650 --> 23:50.991
Now, a year later,
we're about to find out

23:51.058 --> 23:53.794
if Bazzini's has gone boom
or bust,

23:53.861 --> 23:56.930
Revisited returns.

24:01.800 --> 24:03.301
The old Flamangos combined

24:03.368 --> 24:04.836
a really bad concept...

24:04.903 --> 24:06.738
Oh, my God.
It's like a zoo in here.

24:06.805 --> 24:08.373
With terrible food.

24:08.440 --> 24:10.108
Excuse me.

24:10.175 --> 24:11.443
And one of the most
stubborn owners

24:11.509 --> 24:13.078
Chef Ramsay has ever met.

24:13.178 --> 24:14.746
Shut your mouth already!

24:14.813 --> 24:17.415
It took a little fighting
and a big fire

24:17.482 --> 24:19.417
to get this restaurant
on track.

24:19.484 --> 24:20.452
It's all right, baby.

24:20.552 --> 24:21.686
Now, one year later,

24:21.753 --> 24:23.388
is the Junction cooking,

24:23.455 --> 24:26.424
or has it gone up
in flames?

24:26.491 --> 24:27.859
Last time I was here,

24:27.926 --> 24:28.771
Adele, the owner, fought me
every step of the way.

24:28.771 --> 24:30.328
Adele, the owner, fought me
every step of the way.

24:30.395 --> 24:32.364
The rotten food,
the wacky decor--

24:32.430 --> 24:33.732
she didn't want to change
a thing.

24:33.832 --> 24:35.267
Finally she accepted it.

24:35.333 --> 24:37.535
I'm back now to see
if they've changed this place

24:37.602 --> 24:40.071
into a big success.

24:41.973 --> 24:43.675
Hello, princess.

24:43.742 --> 24:45.377
Oh, my God.

24:45.443 --> 24:48.380
How are you?
How are you?

24:48.446 --> 24:50.015
Good.
How are you?

24:50.081 --> 24:52.484
Oh, my God.

24:52.550 --> 24:56.254
He's actually brave enough
to come back here to see us.

24:56.321 --> 24:57.722
You look great.

24:57.789 --> 24:58.771
And are you married?
No.

24:58.771 --> 24:59.324
And are you married?
No.

24:59.391 --> 25:01.326
You're not married?

25:01.393 --> 25:03.561
Still single.
Oh, sugar, seriously.

25:03.628 --> 25:05.096
You were supposed
to help me.

25:05.163 --> 25:06.765
I don't know
if I've got mates that brave.

25:06.831 --> 25:09.634
Where are you staying?
Still at home

25:09.701 --> 25:11.436
with mom and dad.
oh, come on.

25:11.503 --> 25:13.004
Nearly moving out?
On the verge of?

25:13.071 --> 25:14.606
Yes, on the verge of.
I promise.

25:14.673 --> 25:16.308
And by the time
I get back, madam,

25:16.374 --> 25:18.610
I want you moved out
of that house.

25:18.677 --> 25:20.111
Yes?

25:20.178 --> 25:22.213
Promise me.
I promise.

25:22.280 --> 25:25.583
Okay.
Oh, I lied a little,
but what are you gonna do?

25:25.650 --> 25:28.586
Where's the queen?
The queen
is in the kitchen.

25:36.161 --> 25:38.730
Well...
Hello.

25:38.830 --> 25:41.066
Look who's here.

25:41.166 --> 25:42.500
How are you?

25:42.567 --> 25:43.968
Oh, I'm hanging in there.

25:44.069 --> 25:45.470
Oh, my God.

25:45.537 --> 25:47.205
First of all,
it's great to see you.

25:47.272 --> 25:49.240
Really good
to see you.
You sure?

25:49.307 --> 25:50.975
Seriously.
Do you feel the same way?

25:51.042 --> 25:52.344
I love you.

25:52.410 --> 25:53.712
You what?

25:53.778 --> 25:54.879
You see this smile?

25:54.946 --> 25:56.414
Okay. Good.
Good, good, good.

25:56.481 --> 25:57.949
Now, the most important
question for me--

25:58.016 --> 25:58.771
I've been thinking about it
all the way up here--

25:58.771 --> 25:59.818
I've been thinking about it
all the way up here--

25:59.884 --> 26:01.119
do you still hate me?

26:01.186 --> 26:03.388
I never hated you.

26:03.455 --> 26:05.090
He says
it's gonna work.

26:05.156 --> 26:07.258
How stupid can he be?

26:07.325 --> 26:10.261
Are you nicer
to your staff now?

26:10.328 --> 26:13.098
You don't frickin' listen!

26:13.164 --> 26:15.600
Isabelle,
am I nicer to you?

26:15.667 --> 26:17.068
How are you?

26:17.135 --> 26:19.170
How are you?
Don't get her nervous,
please.

26:19.237 --> 26:20.438
Oh, goodness me.

26:20.505 --> 26:22.073
Is she nicer to you?
Yes or no?

26:22.140 --> 26:24.242
Um, yes,
she is a lot better.

26:24.309 --> 26:25.710
She's getting a lot better.

26:25.777 --> 26:28.771
After I saw
how I did come off harsh,

26:28.771 --> 26:28.813
After I saw
how I did come off harsh,

26:28.880 --> 26:32.917
I tried to soften
my approach to people.

26:32.984 --> 26:34.652
Now, where's Bryan, the chef?
Where is he?

26:34.719 --> 26:36.187
He's working
in a bagel shop now.

26:36.254 --> 26:37.622
Oh, is he?
Yes.

26:37.689 --> 26:40.325
Why?
He didn't like
the way we ran our kitchen,

26:40.392 --> 26:42.160
and we didn't like
the way he ran it.

26:42.260 --> 26:43.928
How's business?

26:43.995 --> 26:44.929
It's different.

26:44.996 --> 26:46.030
It's different.

26:46.097 --> 26:47.198
Because we went

26:47.265 --> 26:50.668
from a higher end
to a-a...

26:50.802 --> 26:52.737
more affordable menu.

26:52.804 --> 26:55.273
So you bring in
different people.

26:55.340 --> 26:57.041
Why are you smiling?

26:57.108 --> 26:58.771
You haven't changed,
have you, huh?

26:58.771 --> 26:59.477
You haven't changed,
have you, huh?

26:59.544 --> 27:02.414
I did.
You have not changed
one little bit.

27:02.514 --> 27:03.848
Hey, I'm 70 years old.

27:03.915 --> 27:06.217
Do you think
I'm gonna change now?

27:06.284 --> 27:07.352
No.

27:07.419 --> 27:10.255
Call me stubborn,
a hardhead,

27:10.321 --> 27:11.456
I don't know,

27:11.523 --> 27:13.792
but I feel Gordon
put us on the right path

27:13.858 --> 27:16.127
by going more casual.

27:16.194 --> 27:17.962
Are you still making
desserts?
Yes.

27:18.029 --> 27:20.732
Good. Fantastic.
Are they going well?
Very well. Yeah.

27:20.799 --> 27:21.966
Brilliant, brilliant,
brilliant, brilliant.

27:22.033 --> 27:25.336
Are you happier?
I'm ecstatic.

27:25.437 --> 27:27.005
What makes you happy?

27:27.071 --> 27:28.640
When I see
my restaurant full.

27:28.740 --> 27:28.771
Okay, good.

27:28.771 --> 27:30.175
Okay, good.

27:30.241 --> 27:31.743
Can we go have a bite
to eat together?

27:31.810 --> 27:33.411
Let's go.
So good to see you.

27:36.347 --> 27:37.749
How nice is this?

27:37.816 --> 27:39.584
This is wonderful.
This is amazing.

27:39.651 --> 27:41.186
Listen to the buzz...

27:41.252 --> 27:43.521
The atmosphere.

27:43.588 --> 27:44.823
If this was still
Flamangos,

27:44.889 --> 27:46.491
where would it be now?

27:46.558 --> 27:48.726
Closed.

27:48.793 --> 27:50.328
Business has been
very good.

27:50.395 --> 27:51.996
We're doing double
the business--

27:52.063 --> 27:54.599
big difference
from when it was Flamangos.

27:54.666 --> 27:56.601
What are we going to have?
Can I start you off
with something to drink?

27:56.668 --> 27:57.869
Sex on the beach.

27:57.936 --> 27:58.771
Sex on--

27:58.771 --> 27:59.604
Sex on--

28:01.873 --> 28:02.974
Sex on the beach?
What's that?

28:03.041 --> 28:05.310
You never had
sex on the beach?

28:05.376 --> 28:08.046
I did in Florida
when I proposed to my wife.

28:08.112 --> 28:09.881
Yeah.
But I wasn't drinking.

28:09.948 --> 28:10.982
This is different.

28:13.318 --> 28:15.987
Of course my mother,
with her sense of humor,

28:16.054 --> 28:18.656
had to order
sex on the beach.

28:18.723 --> 28:19.891
Whilst I was here,

28:19.957 --> 28:22.794
we had some good times,
and we had some bad times.

28:22.860 --> 28:24.028
What was the best time
for you?

28:24.095 --> 28:26.064
I guess when you walked
in the door.

28:26.130 --> 28:27.498
You really mean that?
Yeah.

28:27.565 --> 28:28.771
What was the worst time
for you?

28:28.771 --> 28:29.467
What was the worst time
for you?

28:29.534 --> 28:31.336
When you call me
madam grumpy.

28:31.402 --> 28:33.538
What about the bonfire?
How could I forget
about that?

28:33.604 --> 28:36.274
The tropics are going.

28:36.341 --> 28:38.509
Look at that.

28:43.581 --> 28:45.783
It was very important.

28:45.850 --> 28:46.984
I think the older you get,

28:47.051 --> 28:48.619
The harder it is
to adapt to change.

28:48.686 --> 28:49.987
Gordon changed
all three of us

28:50.054 --> 28:53.124
into having to think differently
about business.

28:53.191 --> 28:54.158
Junction burger
for you, sir.

28:54.225 --> 28:55.293
Oh, my God.
Look at the size of that.

28:55.360 --> 28:56.361
Thank you, darling.

28:56.427 --> 28:57.662
Your meat loaf--

28:57.695 --> 28:58.771
or Bill's meat loaf,
I should say.

28:58.771 --> 28:59.163
or Bill's meat loaf,
I should say.

28:59.230 --> 29:00.565
Do you mind
if I have a little taste?

29:00.632 --> 29:01.566
That's you.

29:01.633 --> 29:03.835
Go right ahead.
Good?

29:03.901 --> 29:05.003
Wow.

29:05.069 --> 29:06.571
It's absolutely delicious.

29:06.638 --> 29:07.705
Beautiful.
Really good.

29:07.772 --> 29:09.207
Um, Cheryl,

29:09.274 --> 29:10.375
you're charismatic.

29:10.442 --> 29:11.843
You've got
beautiful eyes.

29:11.910 --> 29:14.246
You've got scary nails.
You're very pretty.

29:14.346 --> 29:16.181
Why can't you date men?

29:16.248 --> 29:18.316
You know what a Guido is?

29:18.383 --> 29:20.785
A Guido. Yeah.
That's what
she's looking for.

29:20.852 --> 29:23.321
The guy of my dreams
will come up to me and say,

29:23.388 --> 29:26.491
"Hey, how you doin'?
My name's Tony.

29:26.558 --> 29:28.771
Are you single?"

29:28.771 --> 29:29.127
Are you single?"

29:29.194 --> 29:30.395
I've got
a long journey home.

29:30.462 --> 29:33.465
And I'd love to take out
and buy one of those pies

29:33.532 --> 29:35.467
to take back
to my children.

29:35.534 --> 29:37.702
There's apple crumb.
Apple crumb.

29:37.769 --> 29:40.705
Or pumple.
Pumple?

29:40.772 --> 29:42.140
Pumple.
Where did that name
come from?

29:42.207 --> 29:43.909
Oh,.

29:44.009 --> 29:46.211
Pumple?
What--

29:46.278 --> 29:49.848
too many
sex on the beach cocktails.

29:49.915 --> 29:53.485
Pumple?
What's pumple?
It's pumpkin and apple.

29:55.287 --> 29:56.855
You know we want
to be different.

29:56.922 --> 29:58.771
Honestly--yeah,
you're definitely different.

29:58.771 --> 29:58.890
Honestly--yeah,
you're definitely different.

29:58.957 --> 30:01.826
You, my sir,
you deserve to be knighted,

30:01.927 --> 30:04.129
honestly.

30:04.196 --> 30:05.764
That was right on.

30:05.830 --> 30:08.433
I tell her all the time,
"I should get a medal

30:08.500 --> 30:10.101
being with you all this time."

30:10.168 --> 30:12.270
Stay there. I've got
a little surprise for you, okay?

30:12.337 --> 30:13.605
Just a little present
from me.

30:18.710 --> 30:20.245
Oh, boy.
First of all...

30:20.312 --> 30:21.780
Is a guy
gonna come out of there?

30:21.846 --> 30:22.881
My apologies.
It's not a guy.

30:22.981 --> 30:24.182
Okay?

30:24.249 --> 30:26.284
But something
that can bring back memories.

30:26.351 --> 30:27.686
Here we are,
my darling.

30:27.752 --> 30:28.771
Uh-oh.

30:28.771 --> 30:29.321
Uh-oh.

30:31.423 --> 30:33.158
No way.

30:33.258 --> 30:35.360
Oh, yes.

30:38.496 --> 30:39.931
Oh, my God.

30:39.998 --> 30:41.466
Not an alligator.

30:41.533 --> 30:44.369
Willy's back!
Willy's back!

30:44.436 --> 30:45.870
Oh, my God.

30:45.937 --> 30:49.241
I can't believe Gordon brought
Willy the alligator back!

30:49.307 --> 30:50.342
Willy's back.

30:50.408 --> 30:51.977
No!

30:52.043 --> 30:53.411
What do you mean "No"?

30:53.478 --> 30:55.146
That's Willy, my alligator.

30:55.213 --> 30:56.248
Trust me.

30:56.314 --> 30:57.916
Being Gordon burned Willy,

30:58.016 --> 30:58.771
our alligator,

30:58.771 --> 30:59.150
our alligator,

30:59.217 --> 31:01.119
it was very nice
that he replaced it

31:01.219 --> 31:02.954
with a new Willy.

31:03.021 --> 31:04.823
Maybe we'll name
the new alligator

31:04.889 --> 31:06.691
Willy the second

31:06.758 --> 31:10.128
or maybe gordy.

31:10.195 --> 31:11.563
Okay.
Thank you very much.

31:11.630 --> 31:12.931
Good to see you.

31:12.998 --> 31:15.367
He wanted to make sure
that we're successful,

31:15.433 --> 31:17.669
so Cheryl can live
a good life...

31:17.736 --> 31:21.239
With her new husband
and grandchildren.

31:21.306 --> 31:23.608
Take care, babe.
Oh.

31:23.675 --> 31:25.810
The main thing
that I learned from Gordon

31:25.877 --> 31:28.771
coming in is that
we had to make the change,

31:28.771 --> 31:29.481
coming in is that
we had to make the change,

31:29.547 --> 31:32.851
or else that's the end
of the restaurant.

31:32.917 --> 31:35.954
Bye. No, don't cry.
Come on.

31:36.020 --> 31:37.589
We definitely
wouldn't have still been here

31:37.655 --> 31:38.923
if this was Flamangos--
absolutely.

31:38.990 --> 31:41.092
We needed Gordon to come in
and save the day,

31:41.159 --> 31:43.428
and he definitely did that
for us.

31:43.528 --> 31:45.263
And we can't thank him enough.

31:45.330 --> 31:48.166
Wow.

31:48.233 --> 31:49.701
She's still a firecracker.

31:49.767 --> 31:51.102
But for me,
the good news is Adele

31:51.169 --> 31:52.604
has embraced changes.

31:52.670 --> 31:55.707
And it looks like the Junction
is back on track big-time.

31:55.773 --> 31:56.975
All she has to do now

31:57.041 --> 31:58.771
is get that 43-year-old daughter
out of the house.

31:58.771 --> 31:59.811
is get that 43-year-old daughter
out of the house.

31:59.944 --> 32:01.412
My God.

32:01.479 --> 32:05.316
Still living at home.

32:05.383 --> 32:07.819
Coming up, he was one
of the most distraught

32:07.886 --> 32:10.889
And burnt-out owners
Chef Ramsay has ever dealt with.

32:10.989 --> 32:12.624
I'm miserable.

32:12.690 --> 32:15.527
Paul Bazzini was a man
of many excuses.

32:15.593 --> 32:18.396
Paul, you haven't changed
enough to convince me

32:18.463 --> 32:21.332
that this
can turn around.

32:21.399 --> 32:24.636
Now, a year later,
Chef Ramsay is back.

32:24.702 --> 32:26.070
And he can't believe
what he finds.

32:26.137 --> 32:28.139
You won't either.

32:28.206 --> 32:28.771
That's coming up on...

32:28.771 --> 32:30.708
That's coming up on...

32:36.080 --> 32:37.982
One of my biggest challenges
last year

32:38.049 --> 32:40.151
was in Ridgewood,
New Jersey.

32:40.218 --> 32:42.320
It was a great little town,
very affluent,

32:42.386 --> 32:45.723
just half an hour
outside New York City--

32:45.790 --> 32:48.659
lots of restaurants everywhere
doing really well,

32:48.726 --> 32:51.028
but not Bazzini's.

32:51.095 --> 32:52.296
Here's your salad.

32:52.363 --> 32:53.698
What salads?
What table?

32:53.764 --> 32:55.600
I'm confused.
I'm confused.

32:55.666 --> 32:58.703
The biggest problem
was the owner, Paul.

32:58.769 --> 33:01.172
This needs
to be heated up.
These are perfect.

33:01.239 --> 33:02.751
He just didn't give
a damn anymore.

33:02.751 --> 33:04.175
He just didn't give
a damn anymore.

33:05.476 --> 33:06.510
Yeah. So I heard.

33:06.577 --> 33:07.745
Paul was an angry man.

33:07.812 --> 33:09.080
Always somebody,
always somebody,

33:09.146 --> 33:10.181
always somebody.

33:10.248 --> 33:12.216
Ugh.

33:12.283 --> 33:14.385
His wife, Leslie, just couldn't
get through to him.

33:14.485 --> 33:15.620
You're, like, dead.

33:15.686 --> 33:19.857
I want the nightmare
to be over.

33:19.924 --> 33:21.192
And his talented
pastry chef, Sharyn,

33:21.292 --> 33:22.727
Couldn't stand him.

33:22.793 --> 33:24.295
If he were a woman,

33:24.362 --> 33:27.932
he would have PMS 24-7, okay?

33:27.999 --> 33:30.902
I showed up the first day
ready and excited

33:30.968 --> 33:32.637
for some lunch.

33:32.703 --> 33:32.751
No. No lunch?
That's ridiculous.

33:32.751 --> 33:35.306
No. No lunch?
That's ridiculous.

33:35.373 --> 33:36.841
Call me.

33:38.376 --> 33:41.045
An hour later,
he finally rang.

33:41.112 --> 33:42.813
I'm starving.
How are you?

33:42.880 --> 33:43.848
Hi.
Welcome to Bazzini's.

33:43.915 --> 33:45.349
The first thing
that struck me...

33:45.416 --> 33:46.751
Oof.

33:46.817 --> 33:49.287
The dining room
was falling apart.

33:49.353 --> 33:51.088
God, they're grimy.

33:53.891 --> 33:55.526
Entree comes
with sound effects.

33:55.593 --> 33:56.994
Little did I know,

33:57.061 --> 33:59.330
the sound effects
were the best part.

33:59.397 --> 34:00.965
Pretty bland.

34:03.534 --> 34:06.137
That's not normal for a chicken
to be so  hard.

34:07.204 --> 34:08.239
Fettuccini--bland.

34:08.306 --> 34:09.774
Chicken--
"Why is it so dry?"

34:09.840 --> 34:11.409
That's.

34:11.475 --> 34:13.544
Ugh.

34:13.611 --> 34:14.745
What a mess.

34:14.812 --> 34:16.447
Any desserts?
Certainly.

34:16.514 --> 34:18.082
Sharyn, our dessert chef,
makes everything.

34:18.149 --> 34:20.785
Gordon's eating
your carrot cake right now

34:20.851 --> 34:22.119
as we speak.

34:22.186 --> 34:24.322
Oy vey.

34:25.623 --> 34:27.491
Hey.

34:27.558 --> 34:28.459
Bloody hell.

34:28.526 --> 34:29.660
You scared me.

34:29.727 --> 34:31.095
Don't come around the corner
like that.

34:31.162 --> 34:32.697
Sharyn.

34:32.763 --> 34:35.499
That is delicious.
That's made with passion.
Awesome.

34:35.566 --> 34:37.768
You make love
to that carrot cake, don't you?

34:37.835 --> 34:40.271
Well, I'm getting divorced,
so it's the cake or, uh...

34:40.338 --> 34:41.605
I'll go for the cake.

34:43.441 --> 34:45.509
I went to the back to talk
to Paul about my rotten lunch,

34:45.576 --> 34:46.610
and I was amazed.

34:46.710 --> 34:48.145
He just didn't seem
to care.

34:48.245 --> 34:49.913
Paul, it tasted bland,

34:50.014 --> 34:51.449
and it looked
atrocious.

34:51.515 --> 34:55.219
Honestly,
it was  disgusting.

34:55.286 --> 34:57.655
Seriously. I mean, you may
laugh, but it's not funny.

34:57.721 --> 34:59.457
Paul had no passion
and no soul.

34:59.523 --> 35:02.751
And that night's dinner service
proved it again.

35:02.751 --> 35:02.927
And that night's dinner service
proved it again.

35:02.993 --> 35:04.628
That's cold.
Oh, come on.

35:04.695 --> 35:06.230
Almighty.

35:06.297 --> 35:07.798
So let me demo

35:07.865 --> 35:10.501
a chicken milanese
for the 400th  time,

35:10.568 --> 35:12.703
Which is nothing more
than chicken and salad,

35:12.770 --> 35:13.838
and my 12-year-old
can do it.

35:13.904 --> 35:15.072
Don't push it, Paul.

35:15.139 --> 35:16.474
When I don't put it
high enough,

35:16.540 --> 35:18.609
you yell at me that it's not
freakin' high enough.

35:18.676 --> 35:20.044
Why do you have
to make it so difficult for?

35:20.111 --> 35:21.145
Why can't--
I'm not.

35:21.212 --> 35:22.646
No. I'm watching.

35:22.713 --> 35:24.148
Well, what's
with the sarcasm?

35:24.215 --> 35:26.784
I can't help it if you tell me
to do it one  way,

35:26.851 --> 35:28.419
Then you change it!

35:28.486 --> 35:29.987
What the
do you want from me?

35:30.054 --> 35:31.422
Changing it right!

35:31.489 --> 35:32.751
Well, you told me the first
time!

35:32.751 --> 35:33.457
Well, you told me the first
time!

35:33.524 --> 35:35.493
Me.

35:35.559 --> 35:36.627
His wife could see it.

35:36.694 --> 35:39.230
Paul, please don't start
with excuse.

35:39.296 --> 35:40.197
That's not gonna help.

35:40.297 --> 35:42.233
His customers could see it.

35:42.299 --> 35:43.734
Get my food now!

35:43.801 --> 35:45.703
Everyone but Paul could see

35:45.769 --> 35:48.472
he was the reason
Bazzini's was going belly-up.

35:48.539 --> 35:51.575
Whether you like it or not,
you have given up.

35:55.079 --> 35:57.781
You think I'm happy?
I'm miserable.

35:57.848 --> 35:59.049
I don't want to get out of bed
in the morning.

35:59.116 --> 36:00.117
I want to stay in bed.

36:02.386 --> 36:02.751
Okay, listen,

36:02.751 --> 36:03.821
Okay, listen,

36:03.888 --> 36:05.789
I'm committed
to helping you,

36:05.856 --> 36:08.092
and I'm not leaving this place
until it's set.

36:08.159 --> 36:10.494
We are gonna work
at this together

36:10.594 --> 36:12.396
at turning this around.

36:12.463 --> 36:14.565
The next day,
I made Paul do something

36:14.632 --> 36:15.966
He should've done
from the start--

36:16.033 --> 36:17.801
open Bazzini's for lunch.

36:17.868 --> 36:18.836
Ladies,

36:18.903 --> 36:20.104
both of you running

36:20.171 --> 36:21.539
the front of house.

36:21.605 --> 36:23.574
I got a kick watching Sharyn
try to waitress.

36:23.641 --> 36:24.775
Ugh.

36:24.842 --> 36:25.976
Is everything okay?

36:27.444 --> 36:28.679
Oh, yes, I'm sorry.

36:28.746 --> 36:30.281
Ugh.
God help me.

36:30.347 --> 36:32.751
With my help,
Paul was doing a little better.

36:32.751 --> 36:33.083
With my help,
Paul was doing a little better.

36:33.150 --> 36:35.085
You got four vegetarian.
I got five normal, yes?

36:35.152 --> 36:36.720
Four vegetarian
on the way.
Excellent.

36:36.787 --> 36:39.990
And the customers
seemed happy for a change.

36:40.057 --> 36:41.458
Oh, my gosh.
This is so good.

36:41.525 --> 36:42.893
This is, like,
the best pasta.

36:42.960 --> 36:45.029
That's it.
The board is clear.

36:45.095 --> 36:47.398
Feeling as though we were moving
in the right direction,

36:47.464 --> 36:49.233
That night my team and I
gave Bazzini's

36:49.333 --> 36:51.135
a much-needed face-lift.

36:53.003 --> 36:55.573
- Look at this.
- The tables are gorgeous.

36:55.639 --> 36:57.441
I love these tchotchkes.

36:57.508 --> 36:59.476
Gone is the lemon pound cake
on the walls.

36:59.543 --> 37:00.978
It looks modern.
It looks great.

37:01.045 --> 37:02.680
The color is contemporary.

37:02.746 --> 37:02.751
Thank you again.

37:02.751 --> 37:04.248
Thank you again.

37:04.315 --> 37:06.050
Oh, good, my darling.
I'm glad you're happy.

37:06.116 --> 37:07.084
Love the menu.

37:07.151 --> 37:08.385
From 27 dishes
down to 15.

37:08.452 --> 37:09.787
It's fresh.

37:09.853 --> 37:12.156
Char-grilled calamari
with fresh chili and arugula.

37:12.223 --> 37:13.457
The main entrees--

37:13.524 --> 37:15.593
bistecca, fresh caponata
with white beans.

37:15.659 --> 37:17.695
Pasta today is gonna be
tagliatelle

37:17.761 --> 37:19.296
of mussels and clams.

37:19.363 --> 37:20.998
Paul, is that menu
manageable?

37:21.065 --> 37:22.633
Yeah.

37:22.700 --> 37:24.802
I invited some
big local dignitaries

37:24.868 --> 37:25.869
For relaunch night...

37:25.936 --> 37:27.204
Let's see what this new menu

37:27.271 --> 37:28.272
offers us.

37:28.339 --> 37:30.341
And I prayed for the best.

37:30.407 --> 37:31.542
These tables
are very important.

37:31.609 --> 37:32.751
I need a second
to think.

37:32.751 --> 37:32.843
I need a second
to think.

37:32.910 --> 37:34.945
Oh, come on.

37:35.012 --> 37:36.647
Al, you got to--
come on, I need help.

37:36.714 --> 37:38.515
I need for you to get
in the game with me.

37:38.582 --> 37:40.017
Please, I can't do it
all alone.

37:40.084 --> 37:42.186
One quality
that all great chefs have

37:42.253 --> 37:43.621
is the ability
to work under pressure.

37:43.687 --> 37:46.690
Paul can't handle pressure.

37:46.757 --> 37:48.325
I need some help. I need
someone to move tickets.

37:48.392 --> 37:49.593
I can't do everything myself.

37:49.660 --> 37:50.961
I need some communication.

37:52.129 --> 37:54.965
Let's just cook!
For God sakes.

37:55.032 --> 37:56.500
Come on, Paul.
Paul!

37:56.567 --> 37:57.968
I'm doing 400 things
at once.

37:58.035 --> 38:01.705
And then things went
from bad to worse.

38:01.772 --> 38:02.751
Bloody hell. Where's Al?
Where's my sous chef?

38:02.751 --> 38:03.674
Bloody hell. Where's Al?
Where's my sous chef?

38:03.741 --> 38:06.410
Al. Where is Al?

38:06.510 --> 38:07.878
I don't know.

38:07.945 --> 38:09.713
Al!

38:09.780 --> 38:11.048
It was a disaster.

38:11.115 --> 38:13.651
The sous chef, Al,
had disappeared.

38:13.717 --> 38:15.352
Listen to me.

38:15.419 --> 38:16.987
Al may be gone,
but the customers need feeding.

38:17.054 --> 38:18.589
Let's support one another.

38:18.656 --> 38:20.024
All right,
take a deep breath.

38:20.090 --> 38:21.592
I'm glad to help.

38:21.659 --> 38:23.193
Sharyn and I rolled up
our sleeves...

38:23.260 --> 38:24.428
Good girl, Sharyn.

38:24.495 --> 38:25.763
Thank you, chef.
Good girl.

38:25.829 --> 38:27.064
And really worked hard

38:27.131 --> 38:29.900
to help save "Paul's"
relaunch night.

38:29.967 --> 38:31.035
The food is fantastic.

38:31.101 --> 38:32.136
Worth the wait.

38:32.169 --> 38:32.751
The night was a success.

38:32.751 --> 38:33.904
The night was a success.

38:33.971 --> 38:36.340
But let's be honest, I wasn't
gonna be there every night

38:36.407 --> 38:38.442
to bail Paul's ass
out of trouble.

38:38.509 --> 38:39.510
Honestly, Paul,

38:39.576 --> 38:41.845
you haven't changed enough

38:41.912 --> 38:43.480
to convince me

38:43.547 --> 38:45.716
that this

38:45.783 --> 38:47.051
can turn around.

38:47.117 --> 38:48.952
I know that it starts
and stops with me.

38:49.019 --> 38:50.454
And I know that I have to be
the leader.

38:50.521 --> 38:51.922
I take responsibility
for that.

38:51.989 --> 38:54.725
You say all
the right things always.

38:54.792 --> 38:58.562
But now it's time
to do the right things.

39:01.865 --> 39:02.751
I'm back in Ridgewood,
New Jersey, to visit Bazzini's,

39:02.751 --> 39:04.134
I'm back in Ridgewood,
New Jersey, to visit Bazzini's,

39:04.201 --> 39:06.003
where last year I had to work

39:06.070 --> 39:07.638
with one
of the most defensive chefs

39:07.705 --> 39:09.306
I've ever, ever worked with.

39:09.373 --> 39:10.841
Now, we made a lot
of changes,

39:10.908 --> 39:12.242
but I always wondered
if it'd stick.

39:12.309 --> 39:14.144
And we're about to find out.

39:14.177 --> 39:16.212
Coming up, Chef Ramsay is back,

39:16.279 --> 39:17.815
But where is Paul?

39:17.847 --> 39:19.282
Listen, I'm standing
outside Bazzini's.

39:19.282 --> 39:20.483
Why aren't you open
for lunch?

39:20.484 --> 39:21.885
Shocking answers

39:21.885 --> 39:23.587
Revisited continues.

39:29.070 --> 39:30.338
A successful restaurant

39:30.405 --> 39:32.207
should have great food...

39:32.273 --> 39:34.876
That's not normal for a chicken
to be so  hard.

39:34.943 --> 39:36.778
Convenient hours...

39:36.844 --> 39:39.714
Monday through Thursday,
5:00 till 9:30.

39:41.049 --> 39:43.451
And great staff morale.

39:43.518 --> 39:44.586
I can't help it

39:44.652 --> 39:46.521
if you tell me to do it
one  way,

39:46.588 --> 39:48.223
then you change it!

39:48.289 --> 39:49.657
What the
do you want from me?

39:50.892 --> 39:52.894
Bazzini's was 0 for 3,

39:52.961 --> 39:54.696
Because chef/owner Paul
had given up.

39:56.064 --> 39:57.865
Yeah. So I heard.

39:57.932 --> 40:00.535
It was a difficult journey.
But Chef Ramsay gave Paul

40:00.602 --> 40:02.203
all the tools to succeed.

40:02.270 --> 40:03.471
Now, one year later,

40:03.538 --> 40:05.640
is Bazzini's
still on the right path?

40:07.642 --> 40:09.010
When I arrived
at Bazzini's last year,

40:09.077 --> 40:10.745
Chef Paul gave me excuse
after excuse,

40:10.812 --> 40:12.480
and I left him all the tools
to succeed.

40:12.547 --> 40:15.183
Now it's time to find out
what he did with them.

40:15.283 --> 40:16.551
Oh, no.

40:16.618 --> 40:17.986
That's the one thing
I told him to do

40:18.052 --> 40:19.787
is stay open for lunch.

40:19.854 --> 40:22.290
And that...

40:22.357 --> 40:23.524
is not open.

40:23.591 --> 40:25.093
I know one person
that will tell me

40:25.193 --> 40:25.763
exactly what's going on.

40:25.763 --> 40:26.527
exactly what's going on.

40:29.364 --> 40:30.999
Hello?

40:31.065 --> 40:33.668
- Sharyn, Gordon Ramsay.
- Holy.

40:33.735 --> 40:36.304
Get out of here.
You're full of it.

40:36.371 --> 40:38.239
Listen, I'm standing
outside Bazzini's.

40:38.306 --> 40:39.907
Why aren't you open
for lunch?

40:39.974 --> 40:41.643
Closed for lunch,
breakfast, supper.

40:41.709 --> 40:43.177
It's closed, dude.

40:43.244 --> 40:45.280
What?
Closed for good?

40:45.346 --> 40:46.648
Ridiculous.

40:46.714 --> 40:47.982
Listen, where are you?

40:48.049 --> 40:49.684
Waldwick, New Jersey.
Okay.

40:49.751 --> 40:52.420
I was shocked that Gordon
called me on the phone.

40:52.487 --> 40:54.088
Okay, I'm gonna come over.

40:54.155 --> 40:55.156
But, you know,
I always said

40:55.223 --> 40:55.763
from the day
he left Bazzini's,

40:55.763 --> 40:56.891
from the day
he left Bazzini's,

40:56.958 --> 40:58.926
"One of these days,
my phone's gonna ring,

40:58.993 --> 41:01.262
and it's gonna be Gordon Ramsay
on the other end."

41:01.329 --> 41:02.730
So, you see,
you never know.

41:07.435 --> 41:10.672
What the hell?
How are you?

41:10.738 --> 41:12.106
When I first saw Gordon,

41:12.173 --> 41:13.908
I was thrilled
that he came to visit.

41:13.975 --> 41:15.977
He looked really hot.

41:16.077 --> 41:17.779
And what happened?

41:17.845 --> 41:20.148
It closed, like,
after the show aired.

41:20.214 --> 41:22.283
It never had
a lunch service, never.

41:22.350 --> 41:24.786
From the day
I was that fabulous waitress...

41:24.852 --> 41:25.763
Ugh.

41:25.763 --> 41:25.987
Ugh.

41:26.054 --> 41:27.422
Is everything okay?

41:28.890 --> 41:29.991
Oh, yes, I'm sorry.

41:30.058 --> 41:32.226
I was late one day,
and he got all pissy

41:32.293 --> 41:33.728
and throwing
all over the place

41:33.795 --> 41:36.164
and being nasty, and I just got
pissed off, and I said,

41:36.230 --> 41:38.132
"I'm out of here."
I just couldn't work there.

41:38.199 --> 41:40.134
After everything
that you did for him?
Right.

41:40.201 --> 41:41.569
Listen, I don't wish
anybody badly.

41:41.636 --> 41:43.438
But I-I was really good
to him,

41:43.504 --> 41:45.306
and he wasn't nice to me.
what a shame.

41:45.373 --> 41:47.408
Um, so Bazzini's
is closed.

41:47.475 --> 41:48.543
Finito.
It's gone.

41:48.609 --> 41:50.078
What are you doing now?
Okay.

41:50.144 --> 41:52.313
So I'm baking.
Check it out.

41:52.447 --> 41:53.448
Cran-apple.

41:53.514 --> 41:54.816
What do you think?

41:54.882 --> 41:55.763
The truth.
Come on, Gordon.

41:55.763 --> 41:56.484
The truth.
Come on, Gordon.

41:56.551 --> 41:57.618
It's delicious.

41:57.685 --> 41:59.787
Is business going well?

41:59.854 --> 42:01.689
Yeah. I'm baking
like a mad woman.

42:01.756 --> 42:04.025
Day and night,
that's all I do--bake.

42:04.092 --> 42:05.460
Okay, go back a bit.

42:05.526 --> 42:07.528
Go back 12 months when we first
arrived at Bazzini's.

42:07.595 --> 42:08.796
Mm-hmm.
Best moment?

42:08.863 --> 42:11.132
When you told me
my carrot cake was the best.

42:11.199 --> 42:13.601
You make love
to that carrot cake, don't you?

42:13.668 --> 42:16.104
Well, I'm getting divorced,
so it's the cake or, uh...

42:16.170 --> 42:17.538
I'll go for the cake.

42:17.605 --> 42:19.874
And the worst was
that stupid  fight

42:19.941 --> 42:21.109
in the kitchen.

42:21.175 --> 42:22.710
What the
do you want from me?

42:22.777 --> 42:24.212
Changing it right!

42:24.278 --> 42:25.763
Well, you told me the first
time!

42:25.763 --> 42:26.214
Well, you told me the first
time!

42:26.280 --> 42:27.849
me.

42:27.915 --> 42:29.183
He threw you under the bus,
didn't he?

42:29.250 --> 42:31.452
He did, but I wasn't going--
no way.

42:31.519 --> 42:32.954
If you tried to throw me
under the bus,

42:33.020 --> 42:34.188
I wouldn't stand for it.

42:34.255 --> 42:36.224
So I wouldn't stand for it
from him either.

42:36.324 --> 42:37.892
Well, you have
something unique,

42:37.959 --> 42:39.894
and that's you
and those cakes.
Thank you.

42:39.961 --> 42:41.329
Look after it.
Thank you.

42:41.396 --> 42:42.764
Take care, babe.
You're awesome.

42:42.830 --> 42:43.998
Good to see you.
Take care.

42:44.065 --> 42:45.666
I was thrilled,
really genuinely thrilled.

42:45.733 --> 42:46.768
He's awesome.

42:46.834 --> 42:48.669
Take care.

42:48.736 --> 42:50.705
Take care, darling.
Love you.

42:50.805 --> 42:52.807
You too.

42:55.977 --> 42:59.147
Sharyn, Sharyn, Sharyn--
you got to love her.

42:59.213 --> 43:00.481
This year
the restaurant business

43:00.548 --> 43:02.250
has had one of
the toughest years in decades.

43:02.316 --> 43:04.585
And I'm so happy
that the Junction and Mojito

43:04.652 --> 43:05.653
are thriving.

43:05.720 --> 43:07.088
Good night.
