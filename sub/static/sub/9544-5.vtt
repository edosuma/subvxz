00:23.127 --> 00:25.955
Oh, yeah. People try to tell you
it's not a same thing.

00:25.990 --> 00:27.625
But it is. You gotta go.

00:27.660 --> 00:29.472
Spring training's like a real baseball.

00:29.507 --> 00:31.226
You know, like it used to be.

00:31.261 --> 00:33.332
when we're kids. Grown up.

00:34.799 --> 00:36.176
Have a seat. You're on deck.

00:36.211 --> 00:37.428
And kids love it.

00:37.463 --> 00:39.913
They can sit up close to meet ball players.

00:39.948 --> 00:42.604
I can see the ballpark from the back patio.

00:42.639 --> 00:45.146
Nice.

00:53.071 --> 00:55.818
Hey, hey, hey, watch what you're doing,
would you? I'm counting here.

00:55.853 --> 00:58.251
- I'll be right back.
- Take your time.

01:07.032 --> 01:09.743
What the hell are you doing?

01:36.113 --> 01:37.876
MONK Season 3 Epi. 05
Mr. Monk Meets the Godfather

02:34.453 --> 02:36.745
- How's it look?
- Not so good.

02:36.780 --> 02:40.229
- It's your suspension.
- What? Again? You...

02:40.264 --> 02:43.130
you just fixed my suspension
three months ago.

02:43.165 --> 02:45.616
Yeah, that was your struts
and your shocks.

02:45.651 --> 02:48.177
This is the, uh, tie bars.

02:48.212 --> 02:50.366
What the hell is a tie bar?

02:50.401 --> 02:52.550
It connects your, uh,

02:52.585 --> 02:56.125
steering knuckle to the center link
right there. Can you see that?

02:56.160 --> 02:58.773
Tell him about that noise
your radio keeps making.

02:58.828 --> 03:00.936
That's my music.

03:01.614 --> 03:03.173
So you think I can drive it?

03:03.208 --> 03:07.761
Oh, not like this.
It's a death trap.

03:13.406 --> 03:15.426
What do you think?

03:15.461 --> 03:20.839
Well, that death trap thing
sort of concerns me.

03:20.874 --> 03:22.382
I think he's yanking my chain.

03:22.417 --> 03:23.606
I mean, what am I going to do?

03:23.641 --> 03:25.311
I can't fix this myself.

03:25.346 --> 03:27.775
Maybe I can take a look at it.

03:27.810 --> 03:30.805
I'm, I'm pretty handy.

03:32.978 --> 03:35.364
Remember that one time?

03:35.399 --> 03:38.772
Norm, you win. How much?

03:39.101 --> 03:40.761
$900?

03:40.796 --> 03:42.958
Where the hell am I
supposed to get $900?

03:42.993 --> 03:45.603
I haven't even seen a check
from my ex in four months.

03:45.638 --> 03:47.534
How are we going to get home?

03:47.569 --> 03:49.132
Well, I guess we're going
to have to walk.

03:49.167 --> 03:51.014
We could call a taxi.

03:51.049 --> 03:52.330
Taxis cost money.

03:52.365 --> 03:55.124
- Are you going to pay for it?
- I guess we'll walk.

03:57.721 --> 04:00.262
- Ah.
- Whoa.

04:00.297 --> 04:03.760
Uh, excuse me. Adrian monk?

04:03.795 --> 04:06.315
- Yes.
- I'm Tony lucarelli.

04:06.350 --> 04:08.886
This is Vince, my, uh...

04:08.921 --> 04:10.355
Associate.

04:10.390 --> 04:12.658
My associate.

04:12.693 --> 04:14.473
Look, if it's not too inconvenient,

04:14.508 --> 04:17.870
my uncle would like to talk
to you about a possible job.

04:17.906 --> 04:21.072
- A job?
- Uh, Lucarelli...

04:21.108 --> 04:24.796
as in Salvatore lucarelli?

04:24.831 --> 04:26.232
You've heard of him.

04:26.267 --> 04:28.786
That'll make his day.

04:28.821 --> 04:31.698
No, thank you. Um...

04:31.733 --> 04:33.793
Oh, oh.

04:33.828 --> 04:37.039
It's, is that the right time?

04:37.074 --> 04:38.456
We're already late.

04:38.491 --> 04:40.454
Uh, we've got, we've got that bris.

04:40.489 --> 04:43.418
Whoa. Whoa.
This is a job.

04:43.453 --> 04:44.637
We can't afford to walk away.

04:44.672 --> 04:46.820
We can't afford not to.

04:46.855 --> 04:50.235
Sharona, Sal lucarelli
is the boss of bosses.

04:50.270 --> 04:54.301
He's the, he's the
west coast godfather.

04:54.336 --> 04:56.149
- So what?
- So what?

04:56.184 --> 04:57.324
You'd take their money?

04:57.359 --> 05:00.861
People who have 110,000 miles
on their car can't be picky.

05:00.896 --> 05:03.746
Fine. Fine.
You go talk to him.

05:03.781 --> 05:06.310
I'll meet you back at the house.

05:09.893 --> 05:11.896
Mr. Monk...

05:11.931 --> 05:15.289
you want my advice, I'd
listen to your friend here.

05:15.324 --> 05:18.477
She's as smart as she is pretty.

05:18.512 --> 05:21.296
It'll only take 20 minutes.

05:21.331 --> 05:24.961
I'm saying please.

05:24.996 --> 05:26.495
All right, pretty please.

05:26.530 --> 05:28.935
With a cherry on top?

05:28.970 --> 05:31.694
With a cherry on top.

05:32.641 --> 05:35.104
- Vince.
- Come on.

05:35.139 --> 05:37.137
Uh, no, not, not,
not in the back seat.

05:37.172 --> 05:40.528
Wait, wait, wait, Vince, he
has a thing about back seats.

05:40.563 --> 05:42.273
Everybody sits in the back.

05:42.308 --> 05:44.030
Uh, Mr, Mr. Monk.

05:44.065 --> 05:46.943
You can ride in the
front with Vince.

05:46.978 --> 05:50.129
- Yeah. Okay. Okay.
- Come on.

05:56.257 --> 06:00.412
Well, I guess that just leaves
you in the back seat with me.

06:01.833 --> 06:04.425
- Are you scared?
- Are you?

07:01.645 --> 07:05.443
Mr. Monk, thank you for
coming on such short notice.

07:05.478 --> 07:07.448
It means the world to me.

07:11.914 --> 07:14.110
Oh, he does this all the time.

07:14.145 --> 07:15.565
He doesn't mean any disrespect.

07:15.600 --> 07:19.208
I understand.
I got blood on my hands.

07:19.243 --> 07:21.087
Yes, you do.

07:22.042 --> 07:25.343
I'm supposed to be in pebble beach.

07:25.378 --> 07:29.257
Instead I'm here preparing for a wake.

07:29.292 --> 07:31.597
Did fat Tony tell you about the job?

07:32.922 --> 07:36.392
My sister's boy Ernie got killed yesterday,

07:36.427 --> 07:38.754
plus four of my friends. Good friends.

07:38.789 --> 07:40.464
Barbershop massacre, right?

07:40.499 --> 07:42.932
Yeah, massacre, That's the word.

07:42.967 --> 07:44.576
I checked around, Mr. Monk.

07:44.611 --> 07:47.736
and other detectives, good detectives
told me you were the best.

07:47.771 --> 07:49.018
Called you a legend.

07:49.053 --> 07:52.769
I'll pay you three times your usual fee
if you tell me who's behind this.

07:54.520 --> 07:56.195
Oh.

07:56.230 --> 07:57.753
I'm sorry.

07:58.960 --> 08:01.825
I, I... I can't help you.

08:01.860 --> 08:05.430
Can't? or won't?

08:06.403 --> 08:10.299
My family is hurt, Mr. Monk.
And angry.

08:10.334 --> 08:13.186
I understand how you feel
more than you know.

08:13.221 --> 08:14.620
They're screaming for vengeance.

08:14.655 --> 08:18.886
They want me to strike out at one of
the chinese gangs or the russians.

08:18.921 --> 08:20.214
I don't want to make a mistake.

08:20.249 --> 08:22.752
I'm trying to prevent a bloodbath here.

08:24.202 --> 08:29.304
Mm. I'm sorry.

08:29.339 --> 08:33.311
I'm very...
very, very, very sorry.

08:33.346 --> 08:36.275
I'm very, very, very sorry.

08:36.309 --> 08:39.938
You know, why don't we just sleep on it?
Then maybe Mr. Monk will reconsider.

08:39.972 --> 08:42.385
Yeah, fat Tony's right.

08:42.421 --> 08:44.569
Let's all think about it.

08:48.004 --> 08:50.744
Oh, Mr. Monk...

08:51.536 --> 08:53.315
Are you right-handed or left-handed?

08:53.350 --> 08:55.292
I'm right-handed.

08:55.827 --> 09:01.931
But I, I use my left hand, too.
Almost every day.

09:01.966 --> 09:04.336
Yeah, you used your left
hand this morning.

09:04.371 --> 09:06.060
Right. That's right.

09:06.095 --> 09:08.903
I'm ambidextrous, really.

09:08.938 --> 09:12.824
Yeah, well, why don't you
think about that, too?

09:12.859 --> 09:15.751
This conversation is over.

09:16.585 --> 09:18.458
Oh, he's a charmer.

09:18.493 --> 09:20.911
- Sharona?
- I'll be right there.

09:25.203 --> 09:26.921
I love you both.

09:27.784 --> 09:30.490
I'd never let anything happen to you.

09:31.587 --> 09:35.636
- I, I love both my hands.
- Good.

09:35.671 --> 09:39.188
Even though I don't use
my left hand as much,

09:39.223 --> 09:42.932
- I, I still love it.
- Okay.

09:43.766 --> 09:48.280
- Let's try a different restaurant.
- Thank you.

09:48.315 --> 09:51.356
It was great talking to you.
I feel better.

09:57.737 --> 09:58.835
Agent Colmes.

09:58.870 --> 10:00.425
Mr. Monk, how are you?
Get in the van.

10:00.460 --> 10:04.344
- I'm, I'm waiting for Sharona.
- Well, you can wait in the van.

10:04.379 --> 10:06.579
- She won't know where I am.
- Oh, we'll tell her.

10:06.614 --> 10:07.996
Just get in the van, please.
Don't make me say it again.

10:08.031 --> 10:10.045
I can't, uh, I, I can't sit in the back.

10:10.080 --> 10:11.044
There's no other seat.

10:11.079 --> 10:13.011
Really, I am not playing
favorites here.

10:13.046 --> 10:17.054
I, I just told the mafia, the, the
same thing. You can ask them.

10:17.089 --> 10:18.807
Yeah, that's really adorable.
In the van now. Get in the van.

10:18.842 --> 10:20.712
I'm getting in, I'm getting in,
I'm getting in.

10:20.747 --> 10:23.189
Look, just for the record,
I'm, I'm using my left hand.

10:23.224 --> 10:26.408
That's fascinating.
Get in the van.

10:30.355 --> 10:31.948
The government can't help but wonder

10:31.983 --> 10:35.074
what you were doing with Salvatore
lucarelli and his underboss fat Tony.

10:35.109 --> 10:38.515
Excuse me.
Why do they call him fat Tony?

10:38.550 --> 10:41.517
Uh, because he used to weigh 250 pounds.

10:42.223 --> 10:45.985
Oh, my god.
Is this the same guy? / Mm.

10:46.020 --> 10:47.719
f
Now, the Lucarelli family's been under

10:47.754 --> 10:50.909
surveillance by a joint ATF/FBI
task force for the last three months.

10:50.944 --> 10:53.209
- Is this the barbershop?
- That is right.

10:53.244 --> 10:55.408
That was taken a week ago,
right before the massacre.

10:55.443 --> 10:56.718
Now, had we stayed
there one more day,

10:56.753 --> 10:58.412
we would have been able to see
the whole thing go down.

10:58.447 --> 11:00.381
Excuse me.
What does he weigh now?

11:00.416 --> 11:01.838
Okay, you know what?
I have no idea.

11:01.873 --> 11:03.970
Mr. Monk, you still haven't
answered my question.

11:04.005 --> 11:05.521
What the hell were
you doing there?

11:05.556 --> 11:09.168
Salvatore wanted to hire me.

11:09.203 --> 11:10.836
Well, that's excellent.
What'd you say?

11:10.871 --> 11:13.695
Well, I told him I'd see
him in hell first.

11:13.730 --> 11:16.612
But not in those exact words.

11:18.360 --> 11:21.143
- We'd like you to take that job.
- No.

11:21.178 --> 11:24.257
No, if I take that job and
I I. D. the killers,

11:24.292 --> 11:27.472
Salvatore will go ballistic,
and he'll wipe them all out,

11:27.507 --> 11:29.962
and I, I couldn't live with myself.

11:29.997 --> 11:32.552
Mr. Monk, you're ignoring
the big picture here.

11:32.587 --> 11:34.334
This is an incredible opportunity.

11:34.369 --> 11:36.281
No one's ever been
inside the family before.

11:36.316 --> 11:39.339
You can get us the evidence that we need
to bring the whole entire family down.

11:39.374 --> 11:42.752
Hey, I showed them my I. D. downstairs.
I just gotto talk to my friend.

11:42.787 --> 11:44.005
What, are you reaching for your gun?

11:44.040 --> 11:47.256
If you're reaching for your gun,
you'd better pull it or step aside.

11:47.291 --> 11:50.551
Monk. Hey.
Colmes.

11:50.586 --> 11:51.927
What do you think you're doing?

11:51.962 --> 11:53.702
Okay, this is a federal operation, captain.

11:53.737 --> 11:55.110
You have no business being here.

11:55.145 --> 11:57.407
Well, neither does he.
What's going on?

11:57.442 --> 12:00.402
They want Adrian to go undercover
and look Lucarelli family.

12:00.437 --> 12:02.163
What's up with this picture
of you and fat Tony?

12:02.198 --> 12:04.490
Nothing, and don't call him that.

12:04.525 --> 12:07.008
You're defending him?

12:07.043 --> 12:08.958
Why don't you start by telling them

12:08.993 --> 12:11.431
what happened to the last agent
that tried to infiltrate that family?

12:11.466 --> 12:13.871
Oh, start by telling them where
they found the body buried.

12:13.906 --> 12:16.530
- Wait, wait, wait, wait. Buried?
- Actually, the parts that they found.

12:16.565 --> 12:19.212
Okay, that's a different situation.
That agent's cover was blown.

12:19.247 --> 12:21.841
Monk's been invited in.
They already know he's a cop.

12:21.876 --> 12:24.512
- But I'm not a cop.
- Well, you could be...

12:24.936 --> 12:26.940
if you help us out.

12:26.975 --> 12:28.782
What? What?

12:28.817 --> 12:30.852
Hang on. Whoa, whoa.
What's going on here?

12:30.887 --> 12:32.398
What do you mean?

12:32.433 --> 12:34.651
Monk, he's playing you.
Just walk away.

12:34.686 --> 12:36.499
No, wait, no.
I want to hear this.

12:36.534 --> 12:38.364
What, what, what are you saying?

12:38.399 --> 12:39.974
What I'm saying is...

12:40.009 --> 12:44.085
is that if you do me this favor...
this one little tiny favor...

12:44.120 --> 12:47.659
I will call the police commissioner
the next time you're up for reinstatement.

12:49.745 --> 12:51.167
Come here.

12:51.202 --> 12:54.328
Monk, I know this son of a bitch.
He's not to be trusted, okay?

12:54.363 --> 12:57.330
You could go get yourself killed,
he would not so much as bat an eye.

12:57.365 --> 12:59.247
He's right.
It's too dangerous.

13:01.501 --> 13:03.685
But what, what if it was you,

13:03.720 --> 13:07.753
and you didn't have this,
and you wanted it back?

13:11.923 --> 13:13.981
I'll do it.

13:14.016 --> 13:18.122
I'm your...
I'm your man.

13:18.157 --> 13:20.320
Good.

13:24.986 --> 13:28.616
There was a witness eating lunch
across the street around 11:45.

13:28.651 --> 13:30.744
He saw three guys walk in here.

13:30.779 --> 13:34.502
They stood here, rat-a-tat-tat,
like fish in a barrel.

13:35.902 --> 13:37.140
Must have been horrible.

13:37.175 --> 13:41.262
This barbershop was being used
by Salvatore and his crew as a front

13:41.297 --> 13:44.504
for a numbers game they were running
out of this back room.

13:44.539 --> 13:48.025
- What's this? - Your friend
fat Tony, it's his life story.

13:50.343 --> 13:53.106
There was 7 grand on that table.

13:54.056 --> 13:58.533
Two indictments?
That doesn't mean anything.

13:58.568 --> 14:00.697
It means he got lucky.

14:01.190 --> 14:03.272
Look, I know why you're
attracted to him.

14:03.307 --> 14:06.500
I get it.
You think he's dangerous.

14:06.535 --> 14:09.382
Some people think I'm dangerous.

14:09.417 --> 14:12.498
Yeah, people driving behind you.

14:13.328 --> 14:17.411
The ballistic report says,
and special agent Colmes concurs,

14:17.446 --> 14:21.529
that all five victims were killed
with the same weapon, an Ingram MAC-10.

14:21.564 --> 14:23.993
Three killers, but only one gun?

14:24.028 --> 14:26.594
Yeah, maybe they took turns.

14:26.629 --> 14:29.718
- The money was still here?
- Yep, 7 grand.

14:29.753 --> 14:31.943
Why wouldn't they just take it?

14:31.978 --> 14:33.990
It wasn't a robbery.

14:34.025 --> 14:36.572
These people don't send e-mails
to each other, Monk.

14:36.607 --> 14:39.159
This is how they send a message.

14:40.070 --> 14:43.364
- What's this?
- From the gumball machine.

14:43.399 --> 14:44.995
The killers must have ripped it out.

14:45.030 --> 14:46.900
Yeah, they used it to break
the window in the back.

14:46.935 --> 14:48.323
That was their only way of escape,

14:48.358 --> 14:50.237
because there were two
uniforms out front.

14:52.592 --> 14:55.495
- Randy.
- Hmm?

14:58.450 --> 15:00.707
Right. Sorry.
Evidence.

15:00.742 --> 15:04.487
Yes, it's evidence.
It's also been on the ground.

15:04.522 --> 15:06.797
Yeah, you're dangerous.

15:10.232 --> 15:12.251
Hey, Monk...

15:12.286 --> 15:16.053
you can still back out.
This is not your case.

15:16.088 --> 15:19.721
- It is now.
- He's just using you.

15:19.756 --> 15:21.986
I'm using him, too.

15:22.021 --> 15:24.735
I don't remember you testifying for me
when you had the chance.

15:24.770 --> 15:28.647
That's right, because I knew
that you weren't ready.

15:30.236 --> 15:36.905
Somebody was sitting right here
doing this crossword puzzle. Aah.

15:36.940 --> 15:38.448
Didn't finish.
I hate that.

15:38.483 --> 15:41.715
Well, whoever it was, he must
have left before it went down.

15:41.750 --> 15:43.860
But why wouldn't he take it with him?

15:43.895 --> 15:46.129
To... to finish.

15:46.164 --> 15:48.133
Maybe it wasn't his.

15:48.168 --> 15:49.405
No, this is the barbershop copy here.

15:49.440 --> 15:52.041
This had to have been his copy.

15:52.076 --> 15:56.190
He must have been working on this
unfinished puzzle for a while.

15:56.225 --> 15:59.613
If I was almost finished
with a difficult crossword,

15:59.648 --> 16:01.634
I'd, I'd take it with me.

16:01.669 --> 16:06.720
Wouldn't you? To finish?

16:06.755 --> 16:08.124
No. Tell me about the witness.

16:08.159 --> 16:13.122
Uh, his name's Philip bedard,
32, unmarried. Works up the street.

16:13.157 --> 16:15.826
- Is he reliable?
- I hope so.

16:15.861 --> 16:18.449
He works at the U. S. Mint.

16:25.749 --> 16:28.042
I can't believe you just said that.

16:28.846 --> 16:31.132
Well, you don't even know me.

16:31.956 --> 16:34.179
Yeah, okay. Okay.

16:34.214 --> 16:36.221
I'll call you later. Bye.

16:38.129 --> 16:41.427
- That was Tony.
- Fat Tony?

16:41.462 --> 16:43.563
He's not fat.

16:44.561 --> 16:47.938
You know, he asked me out
on a date, and, uh...

16:47.973 --> 16:49.257
I told him I'd think about it.

16:49.292 --> 16:52.261
Sharona, you know
what kind of man he is.

16:52.296 --> 16:55.231
Yeah, but that's what
I like about him.

16:55.266 --> 16:57.053
Look, I, I know you
always want to check out

16:57.054 --> 16:58.879
my dates and find out
what's wrong with them,

16:58.914 --> 17:00.922
but at least with Tony,

17:00.957 --> 17:02.929
I already know he's a criminal.

17:02.964 --> 17:04.750
I mean, I can't be surprised.

17:04.785 --> 17:06.800
I've been surprised enough, you know?

17:07.515 --> 17:10.464
Well, as long as that
makes sense to you.

17:11.343 --> 17:12.981
Is everything all right?

17:13.016 --> 17:15.398
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Hey, Vince.

17:16.215 --> 17:19.963
Vince, you know, you, you
don't have to follow us around.

17:19.998 --> 17:22.128
If we have something to report back to you,

17:22.164 --> 17:23.929
I, I promise we're going to call.

17:23.964 --> 17:25.780
Uncle Sal told me
to keep an eye on you.

17:25.815 --> 17:28.657
- It's for your own protection.
- It's a little insulting.

17:28.692 --> 17:31.793
I haven't needed a babysitter
since I was 19.

17:32.711 --> 17:35.097
You had a babysitter
when you were 19?

17:35.132 --> 17:37.664
Everybody did. It was the late '70s.
It was a crazy time.

17:37.699 --> 17:40.406
Mr. Monk, Ms. Fleming,
I'm Phil bedard.

17:40.441 --> 17:43.299
Oh, hello. Thank you so
much for seeing us.

17:43.334 --> 17:45.282
Yes. Thank you.

17:47.123 --> 17:48.919
- This is, uh...
- Oh, oh, I'm so sorry.

17:48.954 --> 17:52.253
Uh, this is, uh, Vince.
He... he's our friend.

17:52.288 --> 17:54.594
- Do they really make money here?
- Yes, they do.

17:54.629 --> 17:57.052
This is the second-largest
mint in the country.

17:57.087 --> 17:58.457
You got any free samples?

17:58.492 --> 18:00.310
That's funny. I've never
heard that one.

18:00.345 --> 18:02.229
Anyway, sorry to keep you waiting.

18:02.264 --> 18:05.634
It takes forever to get through
security these days after last week.

18:05.669 --> 18:09.226
- What happened last week?
- We came up 5 cents short.

18:09.261 --> 18:12.985
- All this for 5 cents?
- Well, they weren't just any 5 cents.

18:13.020 --> 18:15.693
They were five coins that
were accidentally misstamped.

18:15.728 --> 18:17.431
Heads on both sides.

18:17.466 --> 18:19.588
Hmm. Were they valuable?

18:19.623 --> 18:20.821
Maybe to a collector.

18:20.856 --> 18:23.359
There's a lot of nuts out there.

18:23.394 --> 18:26.161
You can say you got
a license to print money.

18:26.196 --> 18:29.696
Yeah, and that is original as well.

18:34.329 --> 18:36.475
A 4-letter word for infatuation.

18:36.510 --> 18:40.914
- Are you any good at these?
- Nope. Can't do crossword puzzles.

18:41.613 --> 18:44.398
So you witnessed the massacre, right?

18:44.433 --> 18:46.272
Uh, not exactly.
Like I told the police,

18:46.307 --> 18:49.232
I was across the street.
I saw three men go inside,

18:49.267 --> 18:51.359
and then I heard the gunshots.

18:51.394 --> 18:54.931
Don't look now, but
we're being followed.

18:54.966 --> 18:57.937
Don't look back,
I said don't, didn't I?

18:57.972 --> 18:59.910
- Where is he?
- Black leather jacket.

18:59.945 --> 19:01.905
He's been following us
since we left the Mint.

19:01.940 --> 19:03.661
- I'll take care of him.
- No, it's okay.

19:03.696 --> 19:06.261
He works for the Mint.
Just ignore him.

19:06.296 --> 19:10.199
They follow employees at random
as we leave the building.

19:10.234 --> 19:12.097
Now you got two babysitters.

19:12.132 --> 19:16.715
These, these three men that you saw,
what, what did they look like?

19:16.750 --> 19:18.920
I never got a good look at their faces.

19:18.955 --> 19:21.927
- I'm sorry.
- What were they wearing?

19:21.962 --> 19:27.094
Uh, jackets. One, one guy had
number 15 on the back.

19:27.129 --> 19:31.824
- Like a ballplayer?
- No, uh...

19:31.859 --> 19:35.938
- it was, it was written funny.
- Written...

19:35.973 --> 19:41.269
written funny. Like...
like this?

19:42.652 --> 19:47.442
- Did it look like this?
- Maybe. Yeah.

19:47.477 --> 19:50.989
Chinese gang.
The Tongs, that's their symbol.

19:51.024 --> 19:55.074
Yeah, now that you mention it,
they, they could have been asian.

19:56.951 --> 19:58.496
But everyone else is going.

19:58.531 --> 20:01.293
Benjy, I told you, money
is tight right now.

20:01.328 --> 20:05.287
- We can only afford basic necessities.
- This is a basic necessity to me.

20:05.322 --> 20:08.949
It's a theme park. It costs
an arm and a leg just to walk in.

20:11.468 --> 20:13.767
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

20:13.802 --> 20:15.738
Maybe next time.

20:18.592 --> 20:20.944
- Sharona fleming?
- Mm-hmm.

20:27.743 --> 20:29.926
- Thank you.
- Sure.

20:40.433 --> 20:43.018
Well...
looks like you're going.

20:43.053 --> 20:45.619
- Your father sent us a check.
- For how much?

20:45.654 --> 20:48.428
For everything, plus four
months in advance.

20:49.826 --> 20:51.776
What's that?

20:59.942 --> 21:04.111
- Hey, Norm.
- It's good as new.

21:04.146 --> 21:06.315
Actually, it's better than new.

21:06.350 --> 21:08.401
I left the keys under the mat, okay?

21:08.436 --> 21:11.381
- You take checks?
- Uh, no charge. No charge at all.

21:11.416 --> 21:13.661
It was my pleasure.
My pleasure.

21:13.696 --> 21:14.880
Now, I've got to get
back to the garage,

21:14.915 --> 21:16.767
so you have a really nice day, okay?

21:16.802 --> 21:19.033
Okay? See you later. Bye.

21:19.068 --> 21:22.807
Wow, you must have a fairy
godmother or something.

21:25.602 --> 21:27.397
Who's that?

21:28.528 --> 21:31.376
My fairy godmother.

21:32.850 --> 21:35.399
VYou know, I'm, I'm
really glad that your boss

21:35.400 --> 21:37.840
changed his mind about
helping my uncle Sal.

21:37.875 --> 21:39.122
How's it going?

21:39.157 --> 21:41.555
Oh, it's going good.
Really good.

21:41.590 --> 21:43.739
We have a couple of leads.

21:43.774 --> 21:45.846
The, the guy at the Mint, uh...

21:45.881 --> 21:47.523
do you think he's involved?

21:47.558 --> 21:49.446
Well, we checked him out,

21:49.481 --> 21:52.037
and he has no mob connections at all.

21:52.072 --> 21:54.151
No motive.

21:56.713 --> 22:00.553
Did you really lose 55 pounds?

22:00.588 --> 22:03.535
You know, it was easy.
I just...

22:03.570 --> 22:05.171
got used to being hungry.

22:05.206 --> 22:09.845
I, I realized that no food tastes
as good as being thin feels.

22:09.880 --> 22:11.770
Except for this.

22:13.296 --> 22:17.343
You know what? I really think you should
talk to your uncle about your nickname.

22:17.378 --> 22:20.492
It, it doesn't fit you anymore.

22:20.527 --> 22:23.250
I thought about it, but...

22:23.285 --> 22:25.567
Uncle Sal is from another century,
you know?

22:25.602 --> 22:27.901
- He's kind of set in his ways.
- Yeah.

22:27.936 --> 22:30.504
I get the feeling Mr. Monk's
the same way.

22:30.539 --> 22:33.241
Well, he's either from another
century or another planet.

22:33.276 --> 22:35.229
I can't decide.

22:39.720 --> 22:44.540
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

22:44.575 --> 22:48.843
How did you get my ex
to send me a check?

22:48.878 --> 22:52.059
I just called him up,
had a little chat.

22:52.094 --> 22:56.351
- I can be very persuasive.
- No, I, I was just afraid that, um...

22:56.386 --> 22:59.517
That what?
That I'd hurt him?

23:00.261 --> 23:02.528
Come on, Sharona.
Who do you think I am?

23:03.163 --> 23:06.790
- That's a good question.
- Well, I'm not my uncle. Okay?

23:06.825 --> 23:10.999
I just run some errands for him,
you know, to pay my tuition.

23:11.034 --> 23:12.795
I'm going to night school, Sharona.

23:12.830 --> 23:15.749
By this time next year,
I will have my MBA.

23:15.784 --> 23:20.247
Really? / Yeah, I'm going to
hopefully have my own business.

23:20.282 --> 23:22.005
Oh. Doing what?

23:22.800 --> 23:25.958
- Okay, promise you won't laugh.
- Oh, of course not.

23:27.085 --> 23:31.984
- I really want to open a bookstore.
- Bookstore.

23:33.209 --> 23:35.860
Okay, you sound a little disappointed.

23:35.895 --> 23:38.404
What, you, you'd prefer me
to be a real badass,

23:38.439 --> 23:41.829
you know, a gangster,
like you see on TV, huh?

23:41.864 --> 23:45.186
No. I'm not disappointed.

23:45.221 --> 23:47.191
Not at all.

23:52.565 --> 23:54.335
Uh, yeah, um, excuse me.

23:54.370 --> 23:56.166
We're looking for Jimmy lu.

23:58.585 --> 24:01.410
Um, you, you speak english?

24:04.807 --> 24:07.391
Send them in.

24:09.728 --> 24:14.143
- Mr. Lu. My name is Adrian.
- I know who you are, Mr. Monk.

24:14.763 --> 24:17.175
I know who you're working for.

24:17.210 --> 24:19.566
I also know you've been
asking people about me.

24:19.601 --> 24:23.604
- Why?
- Um, is this your jacket?

24:23.639 --> 24:27.167
That's right. / Yeah, well, a man was
seen wearing a jacket like this

24:27.202 --> 24:31.611
in Salvatore lucarelli's barbershop
just before the murders.

24:31.646 --> 24:34.766
It wasn't me or my crew.

24:34.801 --> 24:37.045
Someone's lying...
or setting me up.

24:37.080 --> 24:39.775
Excuse me, um, I've been
working on this puzzle.

24:39.810 --> 24:41.544
Maybe you can help me out.

24:41.579 --> 24:44.055
Blank, Jaworski

24:44.090 --> 24:45.869
It's, uh, four letters.

24:45.904 --> 24:49.064
- Any, any ideas?
- 98...

24:49.470 --> 24:52.561
No. Sorry.
99...

24:56.899 --> 24:58.837
Uh, are you, are you stopping?

24:58.872 --> 25:01.734
Are you stopping?
You just, you did 99.

25:01.769 --> 25:04.982
- You can't just stop.
- Why not?

25:05.017 --> 25:08.114
Well, it's not, it's just.
it's not right.

25:08.149 --> 25:13.230
- Why don't you do one more?
- 99 is plenty. 99 is my record.

25:13.265 --> 25:17.730
Uh, Mr. Lu, have you ever been to
Salvatore's barbershop?

25:17.765 --> 25:19.801
Let's just make it an even 100.

25:19.836 --> 25:21.674
Come on, one more. one more.

25:21.709 --> 25:24.914
- Sharona, give him a little boost there.
- I'm not giving him a boost.

25:24.949 --> 25:27.014
- How many can you do, Mr. Monk?
- I don't know.

25:27.049 --> 25:31.729
But I know this. if I ever did 99,
I, I wouldn't stop.

25:31.764 --> 25:35.012
I'd dig down, deep down.

25:36.385 --> 25:39.918
All right.
I'll do one more.

25:39.953 --> 25:42.239
Because you're a friend of Salvatore's.

25:42.274 --> 25:45.424
Tell Salvatore I'm sorry
about what happened.

25:45.459 --> 25:49.658
It's bad business.
Bad for everybody.

25:49.693 --> 25:52.640
No. No.
You just did two.

25:52.675 --> 25:54.733
Why did you do that?
Now he's gotta do 99 more.

25:54.768 --> 25:56.572
Now you have to do 99 more.

25:56.607 --> 25:59.273
I'm just, I'm exhausted.

26:00.114 --> 26:01.584
Look out!

26:08.142 --> 26:11.097
Well, congratulations, Mr. Monk.
You just about started a mob war.

26:11.132 --> 26:13.085
What about them?
your undercover agents?

26:13.120 --> 26:14.298
They were almost killed in that fire.

26:14.333 --> 26:15.638
Please, no, they weren't.

26:15.673 --> 26:17.431
My shirt was singed.
You saw it.

26:17.466 --> 26:19.083
It was all singed. My sleeve...

26:19.118 --> 26:20.762
why did you tell
Salvatore that you thought

26:20.763 --> 26:22.519
the Tongs were behind
the barbershop massacre?

26:22.554 --> 26:25.389
- You knew he'd go ballistic.
- We didn't tell Salvatore anything.

26:25.424 --> 26:27.894
Whoever, then! Vinnie spaghetti
obviously heard you talking about it.

26:27.929 --> 26:31.784
I'm not so sure Salvatore had
anything to do with this fire.

26:31.819 --> 26:35.772
A molotov cocktail doesn't
really seem like his style, does it?

26:35.807 --> 26:38.738
Really? Then who was it then?
Who was it?

26:38.773 --> 26:41.325
Don't know.
Hey, this has been oodles of fun.

26:41.360 --> 26:44.019
Sorry it didn't work out.
We're outta here. Thanks very much.

26:44.054 --> 26:46.282
No, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

26:46.317 --> 26:50.126
Just, we could use this, all right?

26:50.161 --> 26:54.368
What if you get Salvatore to admit

26:54.403 --> 26:56.532
- on tape that he ordered the attack?
- On tape.

26:56.567 --> 26:57.838
What, you want him to wear a wire?

26:57.873 --> 27:00.517
Are you insane?
If Salvatore finds a wire on him,

27:00.552 --> 27:03.262
- he'll slit his throat.
- Or he'd have fat Tony do it.

27:03.297 --> 27:05.095
He's not fat.

27:05.130 --> 27:09.734
If you do this, it won't just be me
supporting your reinstatement, all right?

27:09.769 --> 27:11.760
It'll be the attorney general.

27:14.282 --> 27:15.680
Okay, okay.

27:15.715 --> 27:17.357
Here's the thing.

27:17.392 --> 27:20.366
I can't have anything taped to my chest.

27:21.499 --> 27:24.205
Oh, that's fine.
Come here, let me show you this.

27:25.281 --> 27:28.304
Uh, you see, these days...

27:28.339 --> 27:31.018
we can put a transmitter just
about anywhere on the human body.

27:31.053 --> 27:32.795
We have six options.

27:34.729 --> 27:37.722
Number one... is out.

27:38.297 --> 27:41.383
Number two... uh...

27:42.292 --> 27:45.571
you wouldn't actually
shave me there, would you?

27:45.606 --> 27:48.805
Okay. No thank you.
Number three...

27:48.840 --> 27:50.591
what if you have to sit down?

27:50.626 --> 27:54.187
Right. Good point.
Number four...

28:00.351 --> 28:04.856
Even if I die, don't let
them do number four.

28:06.010 --> 28:10.297
- Number five.
- I'll do. okay, I'll, I'll try that.

28:10.332 --> 28:12.387
That's only for women.

28:12.422 --> 28:14.753
- Oh, right.
- Oh, yeah.

28:15.717 --> 28:19.580
Uh, number six.
Number six, I can do that.

28:19.615 --> 28:23.895
- Number six? Great.
- Not four.

28:27.351 --> 28:29.060
Don't touch that, please.

28:33.964 --> 28:35.714
- Randy.
- Sorry.

28:36.215 --> 28:39.030
- Hey, Joey.
- Hey, Sal.

28:39.065 --> 28:41.619
Thank you for coming.

28:41.654 --> 28:44.404
- He was a sweet kid.
- Yes, he was.

28:44.439 --> 28:45.940
I gave him his first job,

28:45.975 --> 28:49.362
collecting for me after
school on his bicycle.

28:49.397 --> 28:50.465
I remember.

28:50.500 --> 28:52.724
I was there when he stole that bike.

28:55.765 --> 28:58.088
Testing.
Testing, testing...

28:58.123 --> 29:00.053
Leave it alone.

29:00.088 --> 29:02.394
Mr. Monk, Sharona.

29:02.429 --> 29:03.916
I'm so glad you could come.

29:03.951 --> 29:08.085
Well, we're so sorry about your loss.

29:08.120 --> 29:10.182
Uh, how was the service?

29:10.217 --> 29:11.837
It was heartbreaking.

29:13.697 --> 29:16.443
I'm gonna have to frisk you.

29:16.478 --> 29:20.063
- You understand.
- Oh, sure.

29:20.098 --> 29:22.500
- Mm...
- Mr. Monk.

29:29.982 --> 29:33.342
- That is a very nice tie.
- It's mine.

29:33.377 --> 29:37.831
I've had it for... years.

29:39.581 --> 29:42.170
Well, uh, who's next?

29:50.598 --> 29:53.257
You're very thorough.

29:55.598 --> 29:59.311
- Please.
- Adrian, Sharona.

29:59.346 --> 30:02.241
- Thank you for coming.
- Salvatore, how you holding up?

30:02.911 --> 30:06.563
I buried five good men today.

30:06.598 --> 30:09.230
But I'll survive.
I always do.

30:09.265 --> 30:11.291
It's my curse.

30:12.242 --> 30:15.064
You're missing a knife.

30:15.099 --> 30:16.987
It's not missing.
I know where it is.

30:17.469 --> 30:20.704
- Try this scungilli.
- No. Uh, no, no thank you.

30:20.739 --> 30:24.059
- I made it myself.
- Oh, I'd love some. Thank you.

30:25.960 --> 30:28.008
Octopus.

30:31.152 --> 30:33.006
I must have this recipe.

30:33.041 --> 30:35.433
You didn't even taste it.

30:42.022 --> 30:46.818
- Oh, this is delicious.
- I must, I must have this recipe.

30:49.734 --> 30:51.536
So, um,

30:51.571 --> 30:57.153
so, Salvatore, um, I guess
you heard about the, uh,

30:57.188 --> 30:59.679
the firebombing in, in china town.

31:01.707 --> 31:05.218
- You just nodded. Yes?
- Right.

31:05.253 --> 31:08.307
You have any theories about who
might have...might have done that?

31:08.342 --> 31:12.142
Theories? Theories are
for smart guys like you.

31:12.177 --> 31:14.261
I don't need theories.
I know who did it.

31:14.296 --> 31:15.825
A couple of kids from L. A.

31:15.860 --> 31:18.302
A couple of wannabes
trying to impress me.

31:18.337 --> 31:19.593
I took care of them.

31:19.628 --> 31:21.028
So you didn't do the firebombing.

31:21.063 --> 31:25.043
When I want Jimmy lu dead,
believe me, he'll know it.

31:25.078 --> 31:26.997
Hey, Luigi.

31:29.120 --> 31:30.618
What?

31:35.564 --> 31:38.217
Uh, what is that?
Get on that now.

31:45.209 --> 31:46.970
Right, right, try this.

31:49.927 --> 31:52.106
- Wait, wait, I think I got it. I got it.
- What, what, what?

31:57.889 --> 32:01.604
- It's still there. It's there.
- Now it's a water stain.

32:06.097 --> 32:07.863
It's gone.

32:12.980 --> 32:15.948
There's something bothering me about
this case. I can't put my finger on it,

32:15.983 --> 32:19.248
but I would love to get back
to that barbershop.

32:19.283 --> 32:22.447
I'll go with you.
I haven't been back since it happened.

32:22.482 --> 32:25.965
Oh, well, you know, it's
an official crime scene.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.502
They don't let civilians in.

32:28.537 --> 32:31.289
Maybe they'll make an exception.
I'll make a call.

32:31.324 --> 32:33.632
Okay, but you'd be wasting your time.

32:33.667 --> 32:38.249
Cause they never let any... anybody in.

32:39.952 --> 32:41.838
What's he doing?

32:41.873 --> 32:43.638
Thinking.

32:43.673 --> 32:45.634
Brainpower, do you see that?

32:45.669 --> 32:47.512
That is the way to solve a problem.

32:47.547 --> 32:49.991
Maybe we ought to try more of that.

32:50.026 --> 32:51.502
Fewer people to bury.

32:51.537 --> 32:54.288
The mystery man is here,
doing the crossword puzzle.

32:54.323 --> 32:58.988
They grab the gumball machine...
run out the back...

33:02.640 --> 33:05.087
they could have grabbed anything.

33:05.957 --> 33:09.991
Why the gumball machine?
Why the gumball machine?

33:10.026 --> 33:13.753
- Sharona. The crime scene photos.
- Here.

33:19.731 --> 33:21.921
Mr. Lucarelli,
can I say something?

33:23.353 --> 33:26.829
Your nephew Tony here
is in really great shape.

33:26.864 --> 33:29.623
- Oh, come on, Sharona...
- I mean, he's lost a ton of weight,

33:29.658 --> 33:33.478
and he kept it off, which is
really the hard part, so...

33:33.513 --> 33:34.912
Don't you think he should
have a different nickname?

33:34.947 --> 33:37.118
Uncle Sal, I didn't say anything.

33:37.153 --> 33:40.078
He's always been fat Tony
ever since he was a kid.

33:40.113 --> 33:41.825
Yeah, I know,
but look at him.

33:41.860 --> 33:43.277
What about big Tony?

33:43.312 --> 33:46.643
- That's pretty close.
- We already got a big Tony.

33:46.678 --> 33:48.812
- Who?
- Big Tony.

33:50.126 --> 33:52.466
This conversation is over.
In fact, it never happened.

33:52.501 --> 33:54.250
Oh, that's a shame.

33:54.285 --> 33:57.008
- It's not here.
- What, what's not here?

33:57.043 --> 33:58.361
The gumball machine.

33:58.396 --> 34:01.387
Well, they used it to smash the window,
then took off down the alley.

34:01.422 --> 34:03.266
I know, but where is it?

34:03.301 --> 34:06.410
These pictures were taken that morning.

34:06.974 --> 34:09.349
But it's not in the street.

34:09.780 --> 34:11.739
It's not in the back room.

34:13.530 --> 34:15.771
They must have taken it with them.

34:15.806 --> 34:17.710
Why would they do that?

34:25.036 --> 34:26.904
Salvatore, sir,

34:26.938 --> 34:31.395
what happened here, these murders,
had nothing to do with you or your family.

34:33.523 --> 34:35.768
It was all...

34:35.804 --> 34:38.007
about these.

34:42.429 --> 34:44.344
Gumballs.

34:45.612 --> 34:47.753
Gumballs?

34:54.286 --> 34:55.601
Hey, Phil, how you doing?

34:55.636 --> 34:56.917
Remember us?

34:57.697 --> 35:00.800
You said you didn't like
crossword puzzles.

35:00.835 --> 35:02.525
I thought I'd try one.

35:03.123 --> 35:04.633
Pretty good.

35:05.147 --> 35:08.745
Greek vowel, four letters,
beginning with "I."

35:08.780 --> 35:12.530
- lota. I, O, T, A.
- Thank you.

35:12.565 --> 35:14.545
I like puzzles, too.

35:14.580 --> 35:16.967
I've been working on
a pretty tough one.

35:17.002 --> 35:18.772
It involves you, Mr. Bedard.

35:19.598 --> 35:21.464
That's you, isn't it?

35:21.499 --> 35:25.217
It was taken in front of the barbershop
the day before the massacre.

35:25.252 --> 35:26.948
Maybe.

35:26.983 --> 35:28.574
That's a pretty big bubble, Phil.

35:28.609 --> 35:32.056
You must've bought, what, four,
maybe five, gumballs?

35:32.091 --> 35:34.039
It was five. Five gumballs.

35:34.074 --> 35:35.780
Here's what happened...

35:35.815 --> 35:38.990
You stole five cents
from your employer last week.

35:39.025 --> 35:41.515
On any other job,
no one would miss it.

35:41.550 --> 35:43.613
Of course, you work for the U. S. Mint.

35:43.648 --> 35:46.757
They were those
five double-headed pennies.

35:46.792 --> 35:51.025
We did a little research.
They're worth $200,000 each.

35:51.060 --> 35:55.144
One of their security guards
must've followed you. You panicked.

35:55.179 --> 35:56.906
You had to get rid of those coins.

35:56.941 --> 36:00.187
You needed to hide them
for a day or two, but where?

36:00.222 --> 36:02.675
The gumball machine.
It was perfect.

36:02.710 --> 36:05.842
You figured you'd come back when
the coast was clear and pick them up.

36:05.877 --> 36:09.973
But you had no idea that the barbershop
was a front for the mob.

36:10.008 --> 36:14.727
You found out, though. The next day,
when you tried to steal the machine.

36:14.762 --> 36:17.683
- I'll be right back.
- Take your time.

36:17.718 --> 36:21.185
So was it the barber
that tried to stop you?

36:21.220 --> 36:23.708
Or maybe it was a customer.

36:30.785 --> 36:32.161
What the hell are you doing?

36:32.196 --> 36:34.213
Whoever it was,
they had a gun...

36:34.248 --> 36:36.583
That you somehow managed to grab,

36:36.618 --> 36:39.396
and then all hell broke loose.

37:11.206 --> 37:13.233
All for five pennies.

37:13.268 --> 37:15.791
That's a penny for every
person you killed.

37:15.826 --> 37:18.751
Then you said you witnessed the attack

37:18.786 --> 37:22.829
so that you could steer everyone,
me, the cops, the Lucarelli family...

37:22.864 --> 37:26.294
toward that gang in china town.

37:26.329 --> 37:29.103
I didn't want to hurt anyone.

37:29.138 --> 37:31.984
Those idiots pulled out their guns.
It was an accident.

37:32.019 --> 37:34.651
Things just got out of hand.

37:34.686 --> 37:36.136
Anyway, who's going to miss them?

37:36.171 --> 37:37.726
They're gangsters like you said.

37:37.761 --> 37:41.622
Well, accident or not,
you're going to jail.

37:41.657 --> 37:44.245
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

37:44.280 --> 37:47.712
How are you going to prove
any of this without the pennies?

37:48.372 --> 37:51.235
- Did you get that, guys?
- What are you doing?

37:51.270 --> 37:54.365
See that van over there?
Okay, fellas.

37:54.400 --> 37:57.916
You can pick him up now.
Hello.

37:57.951 --> 37:59.509
Here we go.

38:02.316 --> 38:05.083
Watch this.
Let's go!

38:05.118 --> 38:06.761
Here we go.

38:07.413 --> 38:09.755
Now.

38:10.639 --> 38:13.064
- Excuse me. Just keep an eye on him.
- Yeah, yeah.

38:17.285 --> 38:19.490
Why don't you finish your puzzle?

38:19.525 --> 38:23.202
What, what are you doing?
He just confessed. / He did?

38:23.237 --> 38:24.861
- Didn't you hear that?
- No.

38:24.896 --> 38:26.919
No, we got nothing but static.

38:27.902 --> 38:30.073
Your necktie, what happened
to the stain?

38:30.108 --> 38:32.124
I finally got it out.

38:32.901 --> 38:37.448
- What did you do to the tie?
- I washed it... ironed it.

38:37.483 --> 38:40.137
Excuse me. Ironed it?
Are you insane?

38:40.172 --> 38:43.350
That transmitter cost $20,000.

38:43.385 --> 38:45.997
- But the stain is out.
- Great, great, we blew it.

38:46.032 --> 38:48.230
Maybe we can trick him
into saying it again.

38:48.265 --> 38:50.045
Oh, really? How are
we gonna do that?

38:50.080 --> 38:53.028
Well, I'll just go back
there, sit down, and say...

38:53.063 --> 38:56.982
What?
It might be worth a try.

38:57.017 --> 38:59.647
Okay, okay, I, I did it!
It was me!

38:59.682 --> 39:01.181
All right? I confess!

39:01.216 --> 39:04.004
- Just, just let me in!
- Hey!

39:05.785 --> 39:08.535
I did it, all right?
I stole it. I stole the pennies,

39:08.570 --> 39:11.540
and I shot the place up,
so just arrest me.

39:11.575 --> 39:13.221
What are you waiting for?

39:14.864 --> 39:16.800
What the...

39:24.430 --> 39:27.222
He's very persuasive.

39:35.806 --> 39:38.238
Sharona.
You still seeing Tony?

39:39.494 --> 39:40.893
Yeah. So?

39:40.928 --> 39:43.789
I've been logging these surveillance
tapes from last week.

39:44.564 --> 39:47.352
This is from Salvatore's car
Tuesday night.

39:48.876 --> 39:50.705
I think you should hear it.

39:52.446 --> 39:53.824
So what's with you and the nurse?

39:53.859 --> 39:56.232
Just having a few laughs,
you know me.

39:56.267 --> 39:58.897
Hey, get this. I told her I'm
gonna open up a bookstore.

39:58.932 --> 40:00.345
You?

40:01.083 --> 40:03.379
I've never even seen
you inside a bookstore.

40:03.414 --> 40:05.381
What was I gonna tell her, the truth?

40:05.416 --> 40:08.171
That I'm your enforcer,
that I hurt people for a living?

40:08.206 --> 40:09.895
And she bought it?

40:09.930 --> 40:11.844
Hey, they always buy it.
You know why?

40:11.879 --> 40:14.460
'Cause I tell them what they want to hear.

40:16.257 --> 40:18.566
You okay?

40:21.465 --> 40:23.218
I'm sorry.

40:28.884 --> 40:31.444
Thanks, Randy.

40:33.132 --> 40:36.233
Maybe you won't make such fun
of me all the time now, huh?

40:36.268 --> 40:38.748
No chance of that.

40:52.128 --> 40:54.142
So, Colmes, where are you going?

40:54.177 --> 40:56.192
Denver. Other fish to fry.

40:56.227 --> 40:58.165
What about Monk?
You had a deal.

40:58.200 --> 40:59.653
The reinstatement hearing.

40:59.688 --> 41:02.091
Yeah, that was if we nailed Lucarelli.

41:02.126 --> 41:03.651
He's out playing golf today.

41:03.686 --> 41:07.639
We just nailed a trigger-happy coin
collector, so the deal is void, captain.

41:07.674 --> 41:10.284
- You gave him your word.
- The deal's void, captain.

41:11.198 --> 41:12.951
Let me tell you something, Colmes.

41:13.902 --> 41:20.878
Adrian monk may be afraid of milk
and germs and elevators and puppies,

41:20.913 --> 41:25.155
but you, you couldn't pack
that man's lunch.

41:26.543 --> 41:28.544
Uh, that's true, actually.

41:28.579 --> 41:29.939
I've seen that man pack a lunch.

41:29.974 --> 41:31.495
He's insane.

41:31.530 --> 41:33.464
It was great working with you, captain.

41:42.937 --> 41:47.066
- He's not gonna help me, is he?
- No. I'm sorry.

41:47.101 --> 41:48.931
I guess I never really expected him to.

41:48.966 --> 41:50.660
Never trust a Fed.

41:51.910 --> 41:53.127
I should've decked him.

41:53.162 --> 41:56.959
No. Don't worry.
I got him back.

41:56.994 --> 41:58.705
Really? What'd you do?

41:58.740 --> 42:01.005
- See their vans?
- Yeah?

42:01.040 --> 42:02.662
One of them is packed full.

42:02.697 --> 42:06.501
The other one isn't even half full.

42:07.882 --> 42:09.628
They're uneven.

42:09.663 --> 42:12.307
I didn't tell him.
I didn't say a word.

42:12.342 --> 42:16.414
I'm just gonna let them
drive away like that.

42:18.792 --> 42:20.305
That'll teach him to mess with us.

42:20.340 --> 42:23.234
- Damn straight.
- Yep.
