WHERE FREEBO IS.

13:02.583 --> 13:04.750
YOU'RE GONNA
USE HIM AS BAIT?

13:04.750 --> 13:06.250
RAMOS, SODERQUIST,
I WANNA PUT ANTON

13:06.250 --> 13:07.625
UNDER SURVEILLANCE IMMEDIATELY.

13:07.625 --> 13:10.208
(Dexter)
THAT'S HIS NAME.

13:10.208 --> 13:11.291
SODERQUIST

13:11.291 --> 13:13.500
YOU'RE GONNA TELL HIM, RIGHT?

13:13.500 --> 13:14.750
ALL DUE RESPECT, SARGE.

13:14.750 --> 13:15.709
WE TELL HIM, HE BOLTS.

13:15.709 --> 13:16.834
TWO OF MY WITNESSES
HAVE TURNED UP DEAD.

13:16.834 --> 13:17.834
YOU WANNA SEE A THIRD?

13:17.834 --> 13:19.166
ANTON'S ALREADY GOT
A TARGET ON HIS BACK

13:19.166 --> 13:20.417
BY HELPING US.

13:20.417 --> 13:21.667
THIS WILL PROTECT HIM.

13:21.667 --> 13:22.792
YEAH, RIGHT.

13:22.792 --> 13:23.959
(Batista)
OKAY, LOOK.

13:23.959 --> 13:25.458
I'M GONNA KEEP ANTON
IN THE DOCK

13:25.458 --> 13:28.333
FOR NOW BUT I WANT EYES
ON HIM AT ALL TIMES.

13:28.333 --> 13:32.750
UNDERSTAND?

13:32.750 --> 13:33.750
HEY, DEB?

13:33.750 --> 13:34.709
WHAT?

13:34.709 --> 13:36.625
ARE YOU GONNA BRING
A DATE TO THE WEDDING?

13:36.625 --> 13:37.959
I DON'T KNOW, DEX.

13:37.959 --> 13:39.291
I MIGHT BE TOO BUSY
PICKING UP PIECES

13:39.291 --> 13:41.125
OF ANTON'S SKIN
TO EVEN BE THERE.

13:41.125 --> 13:43.709
SO YOU'RE A "MAYBE"?

13:43.709 --> 13:45.583
MORGAN.

13:45.583 --> 13:46.458
HER.

13:46.458 --> 13:47.917
WENDELL OWENS'S MOM CALLED.

13:47.917 --> 13:49.125
SOUNDS LIKE SHE HAS
SOMETHING ON HIS MURDER.

13:49.125 --> 13:50.125
I'LL DRIVE.

13:50.125 --> 13:51.417
DO NOT INVITE QUINN.

13:51.417 --> 13:52.834
NO QUINN.

13:52.834 --> 13:54.792
(Masuka)
YO, MORGAN.

13:54.792 --> 13:55.750
HIM.

13:55.750 --> 13:56.750
GRAB YOUR KIT, BUDDY.

13:56.750 --> 13:57.875
WE GOT A CRIME SCENE.

14:00.625 --> 14:03.417
AH!

14:03.417 --> 14:07.750
FUCKING MESS.

14:07.750 --> 14:10.000
CITY PAYS FOR THE TREE TRIMMING
BUT NOT THE CLEAN UP.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.917
WE ALL CAN'T LIVE IN HIGH-CLASS
NEIGHBORHOODS, MORGAN.

14:12.917 --> 14:16.000
YEAH, I'M SURE YOU LIVE
IN A REAL DUMP, MR. CADILLAC.

14:19.709 --> 14:21.667
MS. OWENS,
I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE

14:21.667 --> 14:23.291
SOME NEW INFORMATION
ABOUT YOUR SON'S MURDER?

14:23.291 --> 14:24.709
YES, I DO.

14:24.709 --> 14:25.875
I FOUND THIS.

14:32.041 --> 14:33.667
THAT'S MY CARD.

14:33.667 --> 14:36.959
IT WAS IN WENDELL'S SHORTS.

14:36.959 --> 14:39.500
THE ONES HE WAS WEARING
THAT NIGHT.

14:39.500 --> 14:41.709
THE ONES HE GOT KILLED IN.

14:41.709 --> 14:42.792
I AM SO SORRY
FOR YOUR LOSS.

14:42.792 --> 14:44.208
YOU STAY THE HELL
AWAY FROM ME!

14:44.208 --> 14:46.166
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA, WHOA.

14:47.709 --> 14:49.625
I DIDN'T MEAN TO--
YOU DIDN'T MEAN TO WHAT?

14:49.625 --> 14:51.208
YOU CAME TO MY HOUSE.

14:51.208 --> 14:55.083
YOU TALKED TO MY SON
AND I TOLD YOU NOT TO.

14:55.083 --> 14:56.083
GOTTA GO BACK INSIDE.

15:01.667 --> 15:04.667
YOU LED THAT ANIMAL HERE.

15:04.667 --> 15:06.083
RIGHT HERE TO MY ONLY BABY.

15:09.542 --> 15:13.542
AND NOW HE'S GONE.

15:13.542 --> 15:16.208
WENDELL IS GONE
BECAUSE OF YOU!

15:16.208 --> 15:17.542
HE'S GONE!

15:26.667 --> 15:29.458
(Dexter)
MARRIAGE, CHILDREN.

15:29.458 --> 15:31.500
YOU NEVER EXPECT IT
TO END IN TRAGEDY.

15:31.500 --> 15:35.041
UNLESS YOU'RE ME.

15:35.041 --> 15:36.583
I WANT ALL CIVILIANS
CLEARED OFF THE STREET.

15:36.583 --> 15:40.250
WE'RE GONNA BE
ROLLING OUT A BODY.

15:40.250 --> 15:41.834
LISA MORTON.

15:41.834 --> 15:44.667
COLLEGE VALEDICTORIAN ON HER
WAY TO HARVARD BUSINESS SCHOOL.

15:44.667 --> 15:47.000
FOUND THE MURDER WEAPON.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.500
UNDER THE SOFA.

15:48.500 --> 15:50.458
SCREWDRIVER'S CONSISTENT
WITH THE WOUND.

15:50.458 --> 15:52.750
(Batista)
THE PERP MUST HAVE USED IT
TO JIMMY THE FRONT WINDOW.

15:52.750 --> 15:54.375
I FIGURED THE GIRL HEARD IT,

15:54.375 --> 15:56.417
CAME DOWN TO CHECK IT OUT.

15:56.417 --> 15:58.917
TOOK A SWING AT THE PERP,
MISSED, KNOCKED OVER THE LAMP.

15:58.917 --> 16:02.291
THE PERP FREAKED,
STABBED HER, RAN.

16:02.291 --> 16:04.083
APPARENTLY WITHOUT SHOES.

16:04.083 --> 16:05.750
THESE ARE SOCK PRINTS.

16:05.750 --> 16:07.208
SOCK?

16:07.208 --> 16:08.959
YEAH, LOOKS LIKE
HE CUT HIMSELF.

16:08.959 --> 16:11.500
OR STEPPED
ON THE VICTIM'S BLOOD?

16:11.500 --> 16:13.709
NO, IF IT WAS HERS

16:13.709 --> 16:15.667
THE PRINTS WOULD BECOME LESS
SATURATED AS HE RAN AWAY

16:15.667 --> 16:17.917
AND GOT BACK TO THE WINDOW.

16:17.917 --> 16:20.542
BUT THEY'RE
MORE SATURATED, SEE?

16:20.542 --> 16:22.333
BLOOD BELONGS TO OUR GUY.

16:22.333 --> 16:24.750
FUCKING SOCKS?

16:24.750 --> 16:25.917
RUN IT THROUGH
THE CRIMINAL DATABASE.

16:25.917 --> 16:27.208
SEE IF ANYTHING
GETS KICKED BACK.

16:27.208 --> 16:28.792
I'LL BET YOU A NIGHT
OF LAP DANCES

16:28.792 --> 16:31.333
I ALREADY KNOW WHO DID IT.

16:31.333 --> 16:33.125
ALBERT CHUNG.

16:33.125 --> 16:35.625
GOT ARRESTED SIX MONTHS AGO
ON A B&E.

16:35.625 --> 16:38.709
KNOCKED AN OLD LADY
DOWN SOME STAIRS

16:38.709 --> 16:40.917
AND HE DID IT ALL
IN HIS SOCKS.

16:40.917 --> 16:44.166
SAME OLD LADY, IDENTIFIES
THE WRONG GUY IN THE LINEUP.

16:44.166 --> 16:45.500
SHOELESS SCHMOE WALKED.

16:45.500 --> 16:47.333
(Batista)
HOW DO YOU REMEMBER THAT?

16:47.333 --> 16:48.625
WASN'T EVEN A HOMICIDE.

16:48.625 --> 16:49.750
CHUNG IS ASIAN, BRO.

16:49.750 --> 16:52.375
HE MAKES US ALL LOOK BAD.

16:52.375 --> 16:53.458
AND TAKING OFF YOUR SHOES?

16:53.458 --> 16:55.542
CAN ANYONE GET MORE CLICHE.

16:55.542 --> 16:57.458
WELL, HE PROBABLY
DID IT TO KEEP QUIET

16:57.458 --> 16:59.417
OR TO NOT LEAVE SHOEPRINTS.

16:59.417 --> 17:02.083
SO HE LEAVES "SOFTPRINTS".

17:02.083 --> 17:04.625
FREAKING MORON.

17:04.625 --> 17:06.709
AND ASIANS ARE SUPPOSED
TO BE SMART.

17:06.709 --> 17:09.333
[chuckling]

17:09.333 --> 17:11.000
FUCKING ALBERT CHUNG.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.834
FUCKING ALBERT CHUNG.

17:15.208 --> 17:18.041
FUCKING ALBERT CHUNG.

17:18.041 --> 17:21.250
FIRST, AN OLD LADY,
NOW A COLLEGE VALEDICTORIAN.

17:21.250 --> 17:24.667
WELL, WE'VE MATCHED HIS DNA
TO THE BLOOD AT THE CRIME SCENE.

17:24.667 --> 17:26.000
MUG SHOTS
ON EVERY MEDIA OUTLET.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.291
SOMEONE WILL TURN HIM IN.

17:27.291 --> 17:28.375
[sighs]

17:28.375 --> 17:30.792
FIRST I GOT RAMON
DRINKING HIMSELF INTO A STUPOR.

17:30.792 --> 17:34.041
THEN I GOT SYL NAGGING ME
FOR ATTENTION.

17:34.041 --> 17:37.041
AND I GOT SCUMBAGS LIKE
ALBERT CHUNG RUNNING FREE.

17:37.041 --> 17:39.041
WELL, THE DEPARTMENT'S
WORKING ON THAT LAST ONE.

17:39.041 --> 17:40.709
AND WHAT IF
THEY DO CATCH HIM, EH?

17:40.709 --> 17:42.667
THEN WHAT?

17:42.667 --> 17:44.667
HIS ATTORNEY GOT HIM OFF ONCE.

17:44.667 --> 17:46.709
I'LL LAY YOU ODDS
THAT CHUNG WALKS AGAIN.

17:46.709 --> 17:48.417
[grunts]

17:49.875 --> 17:51.542
NO.

17:51.542 --> 17:52.792
YOU AND I...

17:52.792 --> 17:54.083
WE SHOULD TAKE
CARE OF THIS OURSELVES.

17:55.959 --> 17:57.709
THERE'S A LOTTA WRONG
IN THE WORLD, DEX.

17:57.709 --> 17:59.166
JUST ASK LISA MORTON'S
PARENTS.

18:00.458 --> 18:01.583
ARGH.

18:01.583 --> 18:03.542
SLICE.

18:03.542 --> 18:06.291
I GUESS IT CAN'T HURT
TO KEEP TABS ON CHUNG

18:06.291 --> 18:08.834
IF THE POLICE CAN'T
BRING HIM IN ON THEIR OWN.

18:08.834 --> 18:10.625
HELL, LET THEM HAVE
ALBERT CHUNG.

18:10.625 --> 18:12.291
HE'S JUST THE SYMPTOM.

18:12.291 --> 18:15.125
WE NEED TO GO
AFTER THE ROOT CAUSE.

18:15.125 --> 18:16.917
THE ONE RESPONSIBLE
FOR PUTTING HIM ON THE STREETS.

18:16.917 --> 18:19.959
HIS BLOOD-SUCKING, SOULLESS,
DEFENSE ATTORNEY,

18:19.959 --> 18:21.041
ELLEN WOLF!

18:23.792 --> 18:26.417
SHE GOT HER CLIENT OFF.

18:26.417 --> 18:27.959
ISN'T THAT HER JOB?

18:27.959 --> 18:30.250
HER JOB IS TO UPHOLD THE LAW.

18:30.250 --> 18:32.875
BUT ELLEN WOLF,
SHE TWISTS AND BENDS THE LAW

18:32.875 --> 18:33.959
UNTIL IT'S UNRECOGNIZABLE.

18:33.959 --> 18:36.458
HAS SHE, UH...

18:36.458 --> 18:39.083
EVER ACTUALLY KILLED ANYONE?

18:39.083 --> 18:40.917
CHUNG WASN'T
THE FIRST EVIL FUCK

18:40.917 --> 18:42.500
THAT SHE PUT BACK
ON THE STREETS.

18:42.500 --> 18:44.750
THE BODY COUNT
IS PILING UP!

18:44.750 --> 18:48.875
IF SHE HASN'T DONE THE DEED
WITH HER OWN HANDS.

18:48.875 --> 18:49.875
DEXTER,
YOU'RE BEING TOO LITERAL.

18:49.875 --> 18:51.750
I DON'T THINK I AM.

18:51.750 --> 18:54.000
DO ME A FAVOR, OKAY?

18:54.000 --> 18:55.834
KEEP AN OPEN MIND
ABOUT HER.

18:55.834 --> 18:57.125
LET ME SHOW YOU
SOME FILES.

18:57.125 --> 18:58.250
NO PRESSURE.

18:58.250 --> 19:00.333
JUST RESEARCH.

19:04.417 --> 19:05.750
MOVE YOUR BACK FOOT
TO THE LEFT.

19:09.709 --> 19:11.458
[speaking Spanish]

19:11.458 --> 19:15.000
YES.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.625
ELLEN WOLF DOESN'T
FIT MY USUAL CODE.

19:17.625 --> 19:19.542
BUT IN THE INTEREST
OF FRIENDSHIP

19:19.542 --> 19:21.166
I SAID I'D KEEP
AN OPEN MIND.

19:21.166 --> 19:23.375
CAMILLA'S REQUEST FOR
THE PERFECT KEY LIME PIE

19:23.375 --> 19:25.291
IS MUCH LESS COMPLICATED.

19:25.291 --> 19:27.125
(Camilla)
I'M NOT EATING THIS CRAP.

19:27.125 --> 19:28.542
GET IT OUT OF HERE.

19:28.542 --> 19:29.709
GET IT OUT OF MY ROOM.

19:29.709 --> 19:30.917
ALL RIGHT, HONEY,
IT'S GONE.

19:30.917 --> 19:32.667
DON'T YOU WORRY.

19:32.667 --> 19:33.750
[coughing]

19:33.750 --> 19:35.166
SHE'S HAVING A HARD DAY.

19:35.166 --> 19:37.375
GOT SOME NEWS.

19:48.500 --> 19:51.667
BAD NEWS, HUH?

19:51.667 --> 19:52.750
TUMORS WORSE?

19:52.750 --> 19:55.834
NO.

19:55.834 --> 19:59.000
IT'S SLOWING, GODDAMNIT.

19:59.000 --> 20:03.250
DOCTORS GAVE ME
ANOTHER MONTH.

20:03.250 --> 20:07.917
ANOTHER MONTH
OF STRUGGLING TO BREATHE,

20:07.917 --> 20:10.333
OF SHITTING MYSELF,

20:10.333 --> 20:15.417
OF THIS STUPID,
FUCKING WALLPAPER.

20:15.417 --> 20:17.542
I'M...

20:17.542 --> 20:18.792
I'M SORRY.

20:18.792 --> 20:22.041
I ALREADY LIVED THROUGH
THIS WITH GENE.

20:22.041 --> 20:24.667
THE END-STAGE.

20:24.667 --> 20:29.333
ALL I WANT IS TO BE
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.834
HE AT LEAST HAD ME.

20:32.834 --> 20:35.000
AND YOU HAVE ME.

20:36.458 --> 20:39.417
I'LL BRING YOU AS MANY KEY LIME
PIES AS YOU CAN STAND.

20:42.208 --> 20:44.667
GENE WANTED ME
TO END HIS LIFE, YOU KNOW?

20:49.250 --> 20:52.917
I WOULD HAVE DONE IT
IF I COULD HAVE.

20:52.917 --> 20:55.667
IT IS KIND OF ILLEGAL.

20:55.667 --> 20:58.291
IT'S MORE THAN ILLEGAL.

20:58.291 --> 21:02.792
IT'S A MORTAL SIN
TO US CATHOLICS.

21:02.792 --> 21:05.375
ONE-WAY TICKET TO HELL.

21:08.083 --> 21:12.417
I CAN'T TAKE
MY OWN LIFE EITHER.

21:14.417 --> 21:19.875
BUT...

21:19.875 --> 21:22.125
YOU'RE NOT CATHOLIC.

21:22.125 --> 21:24.750
NO.

21:24.750 --> 21:26.375
I'M DEFINITELY NOT CATHOLIC.

21:28.875 --> 21:32.208
BUT I DO LIVE
BY A CERTAIN CODE.

21:32.208 --> 21:34.291
OF COURSE YOU DO.

21:34.291 --> 21:38.959
HARRY...TAUGHT YOU RIGHT.

21:40.750 --> 21:44.750
SO WHAT I'M ABOUT
TO ASK YOU IS...

21:47.500 --> 21:49.959
THE MOST TERRIBLE
THING ANYONE COULD--

21:49.959 --> 21:51.875
CAMILLA I DON'T--

21:51.875 --> 21:55.083
JUST...HELP ME.

21:55.083 --> 21:57.417
PLEASE.

21:59.917 --> 22:03.959
YOU'RE STRONG.

22:03.959 --> 22:07.125
AND A GOOD FRIEND.

22:07.125 --> 22:11.625
NO, DON'T--
DON'T ANSWER NOW.

22:11.625 --> 22:15.333
JUST THINK ABOUT IT.

22:15.333 --> 22:18.083
[weeping]

22:18.083 --> 22:22.208
[coughing and wheezing]

22:34.792 --> 22:37.125
(Dexter)
SHE COULDN'T HAVE
ASKED A BETTER PERSON.

22:37.125 --> 22:39.208
TAKING LIVES IS WHAT I DO.

22:39.208 --> 22:43.291
BUT NEVER SOMEONE INNOCENT
AND CERTAINLY NOT A FRIEND.

23:08.291 --> 23:09.500
GET IN.

23:15.208 --> 23:16.917
WHAT'S SO IMPORTANT
YOU HAD TO SEE ME

23:16.917 --> 23:18.417
AT THE ASS-CRACK OF DAWN?

23:18.417 --> 23:21.125
DO YOU HAVE ANY
OUT-OF-TOWN RELATIVES?

23:21.125 --> 23:23.208
WHY, YOU WANNA TAKE
A VACATION TOGETHER?

23:26.834 --> 23:28.625
OKAY.

23:28.625 --> 23:31.375
WHAT'S GOINGN?

23:35.834 --> 23:38.375
I HEARD A RUMOR
ABOUT YOU.

23:38.375 --> 23:41.417
THAT YOU KNOW
WHERE FREEBO IS.

23:41.417 --> 23:43.208
YOU KNOW THAT I DON'T.

23:43.208 --> 23:46.250
I'M JUST TELLING
YOU WHAT I HEARD.

23:46.250 --> 23:48.208
AND THE OTHER
COPS HEARD IT TOO.

23:48.208 --> 23:52.959
WHICH MEANS THAT THE SKINNER
WILL BE LOOKING FOR ME?

23:52.959 --> 23:55.083
SHIT.

23:55.083 --> 23:57.250
THIS SHIT IS CRAZY.

23:57.250 --> 23:59.083
I'VE GOT NOTHING
TO DO WITH FREEBO

23:59.083 --> 24:00.959
EXCEPT FOR HELPING YOU AND
NO ONE KNOWS ABOUT THAT

24:00.959 --> 24:02.125
EXCEPT FOR THE COPS.

24:04.583 --> 24:07.917
WAIT, ARE YOU TELLING--

24:07.917 --> 24:09.291
AM I BEING SET UP?

24:12.083 --> 24:13.792
JESUS.

24:13.792 --> 24:16.250
AND HERE YOU ARE ASKING ME
ABOUT OUT OF TOWN RELATIVES.

24:16.250 --> 24:18.083
EVERYBODY'S GOT ONE.
SO YOU WANT ME TO GO?

24:18.083 --> 24:19.542
I WANT YOU TO SURVIVE.

24:23.750 --> 24:28.208
I DON'T WANNA LOSE
A GOOD C.I.

24:28.208 --> 24:30.250
LISTEN, YOU TELLING ME...

24:30.250 --> 24:33.417
ME LEAVING...

24:33.417 --> 24:35.125
IT'S NOT GONNA HELP YOU ANY.

24:35.125 --> 24:37.125
I'LL FIND ANOTHER LEAD.

24:37.125 --> 24:39.792
SO I GUESS I SHOULD GO.

24:39.792 --> 24:41.000
GOOD.

24:44.291 --> 24:46.583
YOU WATCH
THAT MOUTH OF YOURS.

24:48.792 --> 24:50.333
FUCK YOU.

25:05.125 --> 25:07.375
(Dexter)
THE CODE HAS ALWAYS
BEEN MY GUIDE.

25:07.375 --> 25:09.166
WHY SHOULD THIS
BE DIFFERENT?

25:09.166 --> 25:10.333
TAKING AN INNOCENT LIFE

25:10.333 --> 25:12.667
COULD BE
A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT.

25:12.667 --> 25:14.709
I CAN'T JUST CHANGE
THE RULES FOR A FRIEND.

25:14.709 --> 25:18.291
OR MAYBE I DON'T WANT TO.

25:22.125 --> 25:24.834
BUT I CAN HONOR MIGUEL'S REQUEST
TO RESEARCH ELLEN WOLF.

25:24.834 --> 25:27.500
KEEP AN OPEN MIND.

25:27.500 --> 25:30.000
MURDERERS, RAPISTS,
CAR-JACKERS SET FREE

25:30.000 --> 25:32.375
TO COMMIT
MORE HEINOUS CRIMES.

25:32.375 --> 25:34.417
MAYBE MY CODE COULD
INCLUDE THE PERSON

25:34.417 --> 25:36.458
WHO UNLEASHED THEM
ON THE WORLD.

25:38.500 --> 25:40.709
[cell phone rings]

25:44.375 --> 25:46.333
HEY, YOU.

25:46.333 --> 25:47.875
HEY, DID YOU GET MY MESSAGES?

25:47.875 --> 25:50.041
THE LIST.
YOU NEED MY LIST.

25:50.041 --> 25:53.291
A.S.A.P.

25:53.291 --> 25:56.041
WORKING ON IT RIGHT NOW.

25:56.041 --> 25:58.709
THANK YOU, DEXTER.

25:58.709 --> 26:00.667
[sighs]

26:00.667 --> 26:03.542
WE STILL DON'T
HAVE A HEAD COUNT,

26:03.542 --> 26:05.375
SO I CAN'T START LOOKING
FOR A VENUE.

26:05.375 --> 26:07.500
IT'LL ALL GET DONE,
I PROMISE.

26:07.500 --> 26:09.500
JUST MADE AN APPOINTMENT
WITH THE FLORIST.

26:09.500 --> 26:11.458
WE CAN DRIVE BY
AFTER CARAVAN.

26:11.458 --> 26:12.709
I'D BE HAVING
A COMPLETE MELTDOWN

26:12.709 --> 26:14.125
IF IT WASN'T
FOR YOU, SYL.

26:14.125 --> 26:16.875
BELIEVE ME, I'M HAPPY
FOR THE DISTRACTION.

26:16.875 --> 26:18.125
FROM WHAT?

26:18.125 --> 26:19.375
YOU HAVE SUCH
A CHARMED LIFE.

26:19.375 --> 26:21.500
ON THE OUTSIDE,
IN FRONT OF COMPANY.

26:21.500 --> 26:23.875
BUT MIGUEL,
WHEN WE'RE ALONE HE'S--

26:23.875 --> 26:25.750
SYL, WHAT?

26:25.750 --> 26:29.250
HE JUST...

26:29.250 --> 26:31.291
HE GOES
TO THIS DARK PLACE.

26:31.291 --> 26:33.417
I KNOW HE LOST HIS BROTHER

26:33.417 --> 26:35.208
AND NOW HIS OTHER
BROTHER'S IN TROUBLE BUT--

26:35.208 --> 26:36.375
THAT WOULD PUT
A STRAIN ON ANYBODY.

26:36.375 --> 26:37.750
BUT HE'S BEING SECRETIVE.

26:37.750 --> 26:38.959
HE'S NEVER HOME.

26:38.959 --> 26:41.083
HE SAYS HE'S
WITH DEXTER, BUT...

26:41.083 --> 26:42.333
I THINK IT'S A COVER.

26:42.333 --> 26:46.166
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE
NOT READING INTO IT?

26:46.166 --> 26:47.417
I MEAN, I WENT THROUGH
THE SAME THING WITH DEXTER.

26:47.417 --> 26:48.792
HE WAS DISAPPEARING,

26:48.792 --> 26:50.166
ACTING WEIRD.

26:50.166 --> 26:50.959
WHAT HAPPENED?

26:50.959 --> 26:53.291
HE WAS--

26:57.083 --> 26:59.625
HE WAS...

26:59.625 --> 27:01.083
GOING THROUGH
A DIFFICULT TIME.

27:01.083 --> 27:02.709
RITA, TELL ME.

27:05.917 --> 27:07.291
[sighs]

27:09.792 --> 27:13.792
HE WAS DOING DRUGS
AND HE WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR.

27:13.792 --> 27:15.458
DEXTER?

27:15.458 --> 27:17.000
GOD.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.125
IF SOMEONE LIKE DEXTER
CAN DO THAT--

27:19.125 --> 27:20.333
LOOK, WE HADN'T DEFINED

27:20.333 --> 27:21.375
OUR RELATIONSHIP YET.

27:21.375 --> 27:22.417
IT WASN'T LIKE YOU GUYS.

27:22.417 --> 27:23.834
IT WAS DIFFERENT.

27:23.834 --> 27:25.959
BUT THE IMPORTANT THING
IS THAT I CONFRONTED HIM,

27:25.959 --> 27:27.792
WE TALKED ABOUT IT,
AND IT ACTUALLY

27:27.792 --> 27:29.208
BROUGHT US CLOSER TOGETHER.

27:29.208 --> 27:31.709
YOU JUST CONFRONTED HIM?

27:31.709 --> 27:33.667
WELL, IF YOU DON'T DEAL
WITH YOUR PROBLEMS

27:33.667 --> 27:35.083
THEY ONLY GET BIGGER, RIGHT?

27:35.083 --> 27:37.709
DEXTER?

27:37.709 --> 27:39.709
REALLY?

27:39.709 --> 27:42.792
I KNOW, I KNOW.

27:42.792 --> 27:46.625
THERE'S NO WAY YOUR NICKNAME
WAS WORSE THAN "FAT-TISTA".

27:46.625 --> 27:48.041
'CAUSE "GIANNA" JUST
ROLLS OFF THE--

27:48.041 --> 27:52.000
"VA-GIANNA."

27:52.000 --> 27:53.417
OKAY, YOU WIN.

27:53.417 --> 27:54.500
KIDS CAN BE CRUEL.

27:54.500 --> 27:57.458
"FAT-TISTA", HUH?

27:57.458 --> 28:01.000
YOU CAN CALL ME
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.291
AH, TOO SOON.

28:02.291 --> 28:03.375
AH, IT'S OKAY.

28:03.375 --> 28:04.917
I'M VERY PATIENT.

28:04.917 --> 28:06.625
ACTUALLY, ANGEL, I, UH--

28:06.625 --> 28:10.000
I THINK YOU'RE GREAT BUT--

28:10.000 --> 28:10.959
BUT.

28:10.959 --> 28:12.667
I HATE THAT WORD.

28:12.667 --> 28:14.625
I LIKE SPENDING TIME
WITH YOU.

28:14.625 --> 28:15.959
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

28:15.959 --> 28:17.542
YOU CAN SAY IT.

28:17.542 --> 28:20.500
YOU WANT US
TO BE JUST FRIENDS.

28:27.834 --> 28:29.166
I LIKE OUR FRIENDSHIP.

28:29.166 --> 28:30.333
YOU GONNA MAKE ME
FEEL BAD FOR THAT?

28:30.333 --> 28:31.458
NO.

28:31.458 --> 28:32.959
I LIKE IT TOO.

28:32.959 --> 28:34.542
BUT YOU WANT MORE.

28:34.542 --> 28:36.750
YOU GONNA MAKE ME
FEEL BAD FOR THAT?

28:43.041 --> 28:44.709
YOU RANG?

28:44.709 --> 28:46.000
ELLEN.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.208
I DIDN'T EXPECT YOU
TO COME OVER.

28:48.208 --> 28:49.834
I DIDN'T EXPECT
YOU TO CALL.

28:53.291 --> 28:55.333
SO?

28:58.125 --> 29:03.166
I'M STARTING TO THINK I'M
TOO CLOSE TO THE PRADO FAMILY.

29:03.166 --> 29:04.208
I KNOW ONE SIDE OF THEM.

29:04.208 --> 29:06.041
MAYBE THERE'S MORE.

29:06.041 --> 29:07.291
THERE IS.

29:07.291 --> 29:09.875
SUCH AS?

29:09.875 --> 29:11.542
BROAD STROKES?

29:11.542 --> 29:13.083
UH, MISSING EVIDENCE,

29:13.083 --> 29:15.417
WITNESS INTIMIDATION,
JURY TAMPERING.

29:15.417 --> 29:17.250
I'VE GOT DETAILS.
YOU WANNA HEAR 'EM?

29:17.250 --> 29:19.208
YOU HAVE PROOF?

29:19.208 --> 29:20.458
HE'S A BAD GUY.

29:20.458 --> 29:21.834
HE'S NOT A STUPID GUY.

29:21.834 --> 29:24.125
MMM.

29:26.917 --> 29:30.166
HE COULDN'T HAVE CHANGED
THAT MUCH.

29:30.166 --> 29:32.834
HMM, MAYBE HE DIDN'T.

29:32.834 --> 29:34.500
MY EX-HUSBAND
WAS ALWAYS A PRICK.

29:34.500 --> 29:36.917
I JUST DIDN'T
WANNA SEE IT.

29:36.917 --> 29:41.291
IT'S A LITTLE HARD
TO TAKE IN, YOU KNOW?

29:41.291 --> 29:42.500
IT'S ABOUT
TO GET MUCH HARDER.

29:42.500 --> 29:44.750
THAT'S ACTUALLY
WHY I CAME IN PERSON.

29:44.750 --> 29:46.625
MIGUEL'S ON HIS WAY
OVER HERE RIGHT NOW.

29:46.625 --> 29:48.083
WHAT?

29:48.083 --> 29:49.875
WHY?

29:49.875 --> 29:52.583
TO NEGOTIATE THE TERMS
OF ALBERT CHUNG'S SURRENDER.

29:52.583 --> 29:55.291
YOU'RE NOT REPRESENTING
ALBERT CHUNG.

29:55.291 --> 29:56.333
CHUNG SAW HIMSELF ON TV

29:56.333 --> 29:57.458
AND CALLED ME.

29:57.458 --> 29:59.667
I'M HERE AS HIS COUNSEL.

29:59.667 --> 30:01.166
YOU CALL MIGUEL PRADO
A BAD GUY

30:01.166 --> 30:02.750
WHILE REPRESENTING SOMNE
LIKE THAT?

30:02.750 --> 30:04.834
IT'S NOT MY JOB
TO JUDGE, MARIA.

30:04.834 --> 30:06.208
WELL, YOU'RE CERTAINLY
JUDGING MIGUEL.

30:06.208 --> 30:08.959
AND IF HE EVER GETS ARRESTED,
I WILL DEFEND HIM TOO.

30:13.083 --> 30:15.834
(Masuka)
FUCKING ALBERT CHUNG.

30:15.834 --> 30:17.625
THAT DIPSHIT'S PHOTO
HAS GOTTEN MORE PRIME-TIME PLAY

30:17.625 --> 30:19.208
THAN ANY ASIAN FACE
IN YEARS.

30:19.208 --> 30:20.375
WAY TO REPRESENT.

30:20.375 --> 30:22.125
IT ALSO GOT OVER
600 TIPSTERS CALLING IN.

30:22.125 --> 30:23.792
FOLKS UP IN ARMS
OVER THIS ONE.

30:23.792 --> 30:24.792
HEY, GUYS?

30:24.792 --> 30:27.750
I NEED YOUR ADDRESSES
FOR THE WEDDING

30:27.750 --> 30:29.625
AND I NEED TO KNOW
IF YOU'RE BRINGING DATES.

30:29.625 --> 30:31.750
CAN WE BRING
"JUST FRIENDS"?

30:31.750 --> 30:33.792
I NEVER BRING DATES
TO A WEDDING.

30:33.792 --> 30:35.667
BEST MAN ALWAYS HOOKS UP
WITH THE MAID OF HONOR.

30:35.667 --> 30:36.667
THE MAID OF HONOR
IS RITA'S DAUGHTER.

30:36.667 --> 30:37.667
SHE'S TEN.

30:37.667 --> 30:38.875
MASUKA'S YOUR BEST MAN?

30:38.875 --> 30:41.375
I, UH, HADN'T REALLY--
WHY?

30:41.375 --> 30:42.750
ARE YOU ASKING BATISTA?

30:42.750 --> 30:44.000
'CAUSE I'D BE HONORED,
HERMANO.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.041
UM, UH, I DON'T--

30:47.291 --> 30:49.166
I'M NOT HAVING A BEST MAN.

30:51.583 --> 30:53.291
WHAT ABOUT USHERS?

31:01.000 --> 31:02.375
I NEED BACK COPIES
OF YOUR REPORTS

31:02.375 --> 31:04.000
ON THE SKINNER CASES.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.834
ALL OF TM.

31:06.834 --> 31:08.542
YOU LOOKING FOR ANYTHING
IN PARTICULAR?

31:08.542 --> 31:10.125
SOMETHING, ANYTHING.

31:10.125 --> 31:11.417
I NEED A FUCKING LEAD, DEX.

31:11.417 --> 31:12.792
I'LL BE HERE ALL NIGHT
IF I HAVE TO.

31:12.792 --> 31:14.166
DILIGENT.

31:14.166 --> 31:16.041
NOT REALLY.

31:18.834 --> 31:21.792
DID YOU EVER...

31:21.792 --> 31:23.875
YOU KNOW,
COMPROMISE AN INVESTIGATION

31:23.875 --> 31:26.834
FOR PERSONAL REASONS?

31:26.834 --> 31:29.333
NEVER.

31:29.333 --> 31:31.375
FIGURES.

31:33.667 --> 31:35.083
WHERE DID YOU GET THESE?

31:35.083 --> 31:36.333
CAMILLA.

31:39.041 --> 31:41.083
SHE'S IN A LOT OF PAIN.

31:43.208 --> 31:44.875
THEN I HOPE SHE GOES FAST.

31:44.875 --> 31:46.709
NOT LIKELY.

31:52.208 --> 31:53.208
JUST SHOOT ME IF
I EVER GET LIKE THAT.

31:53.208 --> 31:54.417
REALLY?

31:54.417 --> 31:55.500
HELL YES.

31:55.500 --> 31:57.208
I'D DO THE SAME FOR YOU.

31:57.208 --> 32:01.917
PULL THE PLUG, PUT A PILLOW
OVER YOUR HEAD, WHATEVER.

32:01.917 --> 32:03.625
I'D NEVER LET YOU SUFFER.

32:03.625 --> 32:05.583
YOU WOULDN'T, WOULD YOU?

32:05.583 --> 32:07.291
[knock at door]

32:07.291 --> 32:08.291
DEXTER.

32:08.291 --> 32:09.917
WILL YOU BRING
THE PRELIM BLOOD REPORT

32:09.917 --> 32:11.125
ON LISA MORTON
TO THE BRIEFING ROOM?

32:11.125 --> 32:12.750
MIGUEL PRADO'S ASKING FOR IT.

32:12.750 --> 32:14.083
HE'S HERE?

32:14.083 --> 32:15.917
HE AND ELLEN WOLF.

32:15.917 --> 32:17.709
TO NEGOTIATE THE TERMS

32:17.709 --> 32:19.417
OF ALBERT CHUNG'S SURRENDER.

32:19.417 --> 32:21.208
WEAR YOUR FLAK JACKET.

32:21.208 --> 32:23.208
[sighs]

32:23.208 --> 32:25.208
I'M NOT INTERESTED
IN YOUR TERMS, COUNSELOR.

32:25.208 --> 32:27.125
ALBERT CHUNG NEEDS
TO TURN HIMSELF IN.

32:27.125 --> 32:28.208
IF YOU WANT ALBERT CHUNG
I SUGGEST

32:28.208 --> 32:30.250
YOU GET INTERESTED,
COUNSELOR.

32:30.250 --> 32:32.208
PRELIMINARY BLOOD REPORT
AS REQUESTED.

32:33.750 --> 32:35.542
I'D ACTUALLY LIKE
DEXTER TO STAY.

32:35.542 --> 32:37.458
MS. WOLF MIGHT NEED

32:37.458 --> 32:38.750
A FORENSICS EXPERT
TO EXPLAIN TO HER

32:38.750 --> 32:42.083
HOW HOPELESS
HER CASE REALLY IS.

32:42.083 --> 32:43.500
OH, PLEASE, DO STAY.

32:43.500 --> 32:45.291
DEXTER.

32:45.291 --> 32:49.458
(Dexter)
HE WANTS ME TO SEE HOW BAD
ELLEN WOLF REALLY IS.

32:49.458 --> 32:51.667
THIS IS ME OPEN-MINDED.

32:51.667 --> 32:53.125
[sighs]

32:53.125 --> 32:55.083
GO AHEAD WITH YOUR TERMS,
COUNSELOR.

32:55.083 --> 32:57.166
MY CLIENT REQUESTS
THE NEWS MEDIA BE PRESENT

32:57.166 --> 32:59.208
AND THAT HE BE ALLOWED
TO MAKE A STATEMENT.

32:59.208 --> 33:01.917
HE REQUESTS THE CHARGE
BE KICKED DOWN TO MANSLAUGHTER.

33:01.917 --> 33:03.792
HMM, YOU'VE GOTTA BE KIDDING.

33:03.792 --> 33:07.500
HE ALSO REQUESTS
CONJUGAL VISITATION.

33:07.500 --> 33:09.750
JESUS, YOU HAVE NO SHAME!

33:09.750 --> 33:10.792
AND NO CASE!

33:10.792 --> 33:12.250
RUN THE EVIDENCE

33:12.250 --> 33:13.750
FROM THE CRIME SCENE,
WILL YOU?

33:13.750 --> 33:15.834
BLOOD AT THE SCENE BELONGED
TO ALBERT CHUNG.

33:15.834 --> 33:17.500
DNA MATCHED HIS SAMPLE
IN OUR DATABASE.

33:17.500 --> 33:19.041
ODDS ARE 170 MILLION TO ONE

33:19.041 --> 33:20.625
THAT IT'S ANYONE
BUT ALBERT CHUNG.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.500
MMM, IT WON'T HOLD UP.

33:24.500 --> 33:27.500
YOU DO KNOW WHAT ODDS ARE?

33:27.500 --> 33:29.125
THE JURY WON'T.

33:29.125 --> 33:30.959
NOT WHEN I GET DONE
DISCREDITING YOU

33:30.959 --> 33:32.000
AND YOUR CHAIN OF CUSTODY.

33:32.000 --> 33:33.750
I THINK WE ALL KNOW

33:33.750 --> 33:34.834
HOW EASY IT IS
TO PLANT EVIDENCE

33:34.834 --> 33:36.667
AND, WELL...

33:36.667 --> 33:38.166
YOU LOOK THE TYPE.

33:38.166 --> 33:41.583
(Dexter)
DO I SEE SHEETS OF PLASTIC
IN YOUR FUTURE?

33:41.583 --> 33:42.667
[clears throat]

33:42.667 --> 33:44.417
DEXTER'S WORK IS SOLID, ELLEN.

33:44.417 --> 33:46.834
YOUR PROSECUTOR ISN'T.

33:46.834 --> 33:48.542
WALK IN THE PARK
TO DISCREDIT YOU, COUNSELOR.

33:48.542 --> 33:49.834
(Miguel)
TRY IT.

33:49.834 --> 33:52.000
WE'RE GONNA ADD SLANDER TO
AIDING AND ABETTING.

33:52.000 --> 33:53.000
OH, I'M NOT THE ONE ON TRIAL.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.208
OH, YOU SHOULD BE.
YOU SHOULD BE!

33:55.208 --> 33:56.417
GETTING YOUR BROTHER OFF
WITH A SLAP ON THE WRIST!

33:56.417 --> 33:58.000
NOT TO MENTION
THE CHICKY HINES DEBACLE.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.834
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S STAY ON POINT HERE.

33:59.834 --> 34:02.166
IF ALBERT CHUNG KILLS AGAIN

34:02.166 --> 34:04.166
WHILE YOU PURSUE THIS BULLSHIT,
THAT BLOOD IS GONNA

34:04.166 --> 34:05.625
BE ON YOUR HANDS.
OR DO YOU EVEN CARE?

34:05.625 --> 34:06.667
LIKE YOU DO?

34:06.667 --> 34:08.333
YOU SPOUT OFF ABOUT JUSTICE

34:08.333 --> 34:10.041
AND THE CONSTITUTION

34:10.041 --> 34:11.542
EXCEPT FOR THAT PESKY PART
ABOUT EVERYONE

34:11.542 --> 34:13.750
DESERVING A FAIR TRIAL.

34:13.750 --> 34:14.792
WHILE YOU SET FREE
THE SCUM OF THE EARTH

34:14.792 --> 34:16.750
FOR A FAST BUCK, RIGHT?

34:16.750 --> 34:19.333
HOW MANY PRO BONOS
DO YOU TAKE ON, MIGUEL?

34:19.333 --> 34:21.125
HUH?

34:21.125 --> 34:22.709
HOW MANY INNOCENT PEOPLE
HAVE YOU SAVED

34:22.709 --> 34:23.959
FROM FASCISTIC PROSECUTORS--

34:23.959 --> 34:25.041
ELLEN.

34:25.041 --> 34:26.500
DON'T KID YOURSELF.

34:26.500 --> 34:27.667
YOU MIGHT AS WELL
BE WALKING THE STREET,

34:27.667 --> 34:29.208
THE WAY YOU MAKE A LIVING.

34:29.208 --> 34:30.834
OKAY, ENOUGH, ENOUGH!
[laughing]

34:34.166 --> 34:36.625
DEXTER, WOULD YOU
STEP OUTSIDE, PLEASE?

34:36.625 --> 34:38.166
YEAH.

34:40.917 --> 34:44.917
(Laguerta)
MIGUEL, YOU KNOW THAT THAT
WAS COMPLETELY OUT OF LINE.

34:44.917 --> 34:47.917
(Dexter)
I'M NO FAN OF ELLEN WOLF'S,
BUT ALL I SEE

34:47.917 --> 34:50.542
IS A DEFENSE ATTORNEY
DOING HER JOB.

34:50.542 --> 34:51.834
MAYBE TOO WELL.

34:51.834 --> 34:53.709
BUT I CAN'T KILL HER FOR THAT.

34:53.709 --> 34:56.792
NOW I HAVE TO TELL MIGUEL NO.

34:56.792 --> 34:59.917
NOT WHAT HE WANTS TO HEAR.

34:59.917 --> 35:02.709
YOU'RE GOING
THE WRONG WAY, MORGAN.

35:02.709 --> 35:04.208
I'M JUST
GRABBING DINNER, SARGE.

35:04.208 --> 35:05.834
I'M GONNA DO SOME OVERTIME
ON THE SKINNER CASE.

35:05.834 --> 35:08.333
WHAT DO YOU HEAR
FROM ANTON?

35:08.333 --> 35:10.750
HE'S NOT ANSWERING HIS CALLS
BUT I THINK HE PROBABLY--

35:10.750 --> 35:11.875
YEAH, THAT'S GOOD.

35:11.875 --> 35:12.917
OKAY, SEE YOU.

35:12.917 --> 35:13.917
GIANNA?

35:13.917 --> 35:16.041
HEY, JUST HEADING OUT.

35:16.041 --> 35:18.458
YEAH, UM.

35:18.458 --> 35:21.250
A BUDDY OF MINE IS GETTING
MARRIED IN A FEW WEEKS

35:21.250 --> 35:23.959
AND HE ASKED ME
IF I WAS GONNA BRING A DATE

35:23.959 --> 35:26.500
AND YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
I WANT TO INVITE.

35:26.500 --> 35:28.291
YOU'RE INVITING ME
TO A WEDDING?

35:28.291 --> 35:31.166
MAYBE YOU DON'T GET
THE CONCEPT OF FRIENDS?

35:31.166 --> 35:32.375
IT'S NOT A DATE.

35:32.375 --> 35:35.750
IT'S--IT'S A PLUS ONE.

35:35.750 --> 35:37.750
THE WEDDING
IS BESIDE THE POINT.

35:37.750 --> 35:39.959
IT MADE ME REALIZE

35:39.959 --> 35:42.125
THAT YOU'RE THE ONE
I WANNA END TIME WITH.

35:42.125 --> 35:45.125
AND IF US BEING FRIENDS MEANS
I GET TO KEEP DOING THAT,

35:45.125 --> 35:46.375
I'M IN.

35:46.375 --> 35:50.125
THIS ISN'T SOME KIND OF WEIRD
END RUN IS IT?

35:50.125 --> 35:52.250
MAKE ME SEE
HOW SENSITIVE YOU REALLY ARE?

35:52.250 --> 35:54.291
I'M NOT ALL THAT SENSITIVE.
YEAH, YOU ARE.

35:58.667 --> 36:00.208
I'M CONFUSED.

36:00.208 --> 36:03.000
I'M--

36:03.000 --> 36:04.959
(Dexter)
HAND-HOLDING.

36:04.959 --> 36:06.291
SO SIMPLE.

36:06.291 --> 36:09.166
SO INTIMATE.

36:09.166 --> 36:11.709
SO...UNCOMFORTABLE.

36:11.709 --> 36:13.875
SORRY ABOUT THE PIE.

36:13.875 --> 36:15.083
I WAS TOLD
IT WAS THE BEST.

36:15.083 --> 36:16.375
GOT FIVE STARS.

36:16.375 --> 36:19.166
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

36:19.166 --> 36:21.709
UNTIL YOU FIND ME
THE PERFECT KEY LIME PIE

36:21.709 --> 36:24.291
I HAVE SOMETHING TO LIVE FOR.

36:28.166 --> 36:31.250
DEXTER, I'M SO SORRY

36:31.250 --> 36:35.375
FOR PUTTING YOU
IN THAT HORRIBLE POSITION.

36:35.375 --> 36:38.667
ASKING YOU TO VIOLATE
YOUR CONSCIENCE

36:38.667 --> 36:41.917
WAS ONE OF THE WORST THINGS
I'VE EVER DONE.

36:41.917 --> 36:45.917
I WANT TO YOU HELP YOU,
CAMILLA.

36:45.917 --> 36:47.750
IF I WERE SOMEONE ELSE,
I'D DO IT.

36:47.750 --> 36:51.166
I KNOW.

36:51.166 --> 36:54.834
I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT
ABOUT YOUR PAST

36:54.834 --> 36:59.125
BEFORE I ASKED.

36:59.125 --> 37:00.709
MY PAST?

37:00.709 --> 37:05.000
I KNOW YOUR SECRET, DEXTER.

37:08.709 --> 37:11.542
YOU THINK...

37:11.542 --> 37:14.834
IF YOU HELP ME DIE...

37:14.834 --> 37:18.709
YOU'LL BE LIKE HIM.

37:18.709 --> 37:20.917
YOUR BROTHER.

37:20.917 --> 37:23.542
BRIAN MOSER.

37:23.542 --> 37:25.875
THE ICE TRUCK KILLER.

37:25.875 --> 37:28.625
I DON'T HAVE A BROTHER.

37:28.625 --> 37:32.208
YOU DID.

37:32.208 --> 37:37.417
I READ YOUR FILE
BEFORE I DESTROYED IT.

37:37.417 --> 37:40.208
YOUR BIRTH MOTHER
WAS LAURA MOSER.

37:40.208 --> 37:45.041
WHEN THE NEWSPAPER
SAID BRIAN MOSER

37:45.041 --> 37:48.750
WAS THE ICE TRUCK KILLER...

37:48.750 --> 37:50.583
I MADE THE CONNECTION.

37:50.583 --> 37:52.917
CAMILLA--

37:52.917 --> 37:54.291
IT'S ALL RIGHT, DEXTER.

37:58.125 --> 38:00.625
I'LL TAKE IT TO MY GRAVE.

38:04.625 --> 38:09.417
AND YOU COULD
NEVER BE LIKE HIM.

38:13.375 --> 38:15.417
[silently]
NO.

38:21.000 --> 38:25.792
I HAD A HIGH OPINION
OF YOU, DEB.

38:25.792 --> 38:27.333
GUESS I WAS WRONG.

38:27.333 --> 38:28.917
I TOLD YOU REPEATEDLY
TO STAY OUT OF MY SHIT

38:28.917 --> 38:30.250
AND YOU WOULDN'T.

38:30.250 --> 38:33.333
SO YOU TOLD QUINN
I WAS INVESTIGATING HIM,

38:33.333 --> 38:35.917
HE DID WHAT HE DOES,
AND NOW THE CASE IS DEAD.

38:35.917 --> 38:38.250
YOU CHOSE THE WRONG FRIEND.

38:38.250 --> 38:39.208
HEY, YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO FUCKED HIM.

38:39.208 --> 38:41.291
NOT MY FAULT HE DIDN'T
WANT AN ENCORE.

38:41.291 --> 38:43.291
IS THAT WHAT HE TOLD YOU
THIS WAS ABOUT?

38:43.291 --> 38:44.291
HE DIDN'T HAVE TO.

38:44.291 --> 38:45.375
IT WAS OBVIOUS.

38:45.375 --> 38:47.125
LITTLE MISS HEARTBREAK

38:47.125 --> 38:48.792
TURNS A CADILLAC
AND A FANCY WATCH

38:48.792 --> 38:51.166
INTO A FUCKING
I.A. INVESTIGATION.

38:51.166 --> 38:52.959
HOW IS THAT EVEN ORIGINAL?

38:52.959 --> 38:55.250
WHAT AN EMPTY ROOM
YOUR WORLD MUST BE

38:55.250 --> 38:57.333
IF THOSE ARE
THE DOTS YOU CONNECTED.

38:57.333 --> 38:59.834
I'M HAPPILY MARRIED.

38:59.834 --> 39:01.333
SEVEN YEARS.

39:01.333 --> 39:03.417
WORKING ON OUR SECOND KID.

39:03.417 --> 39:06.667
WITH ZERO INTEREST IN A WASTE
OF CLOTHES LIKE QUINN.

39:06.667 --> 39:08.125
FINE.

39:08.125 --> 39:10.458
I REALLY DON'T GIVE A SHIT.

39:10.458 --> 39:12.834
WELL THEN GIVE
A SHIT ABOUT THIS.

39:12.834 --> 39:14.000
A COP'S DEAD

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
'CAUSE QUINN CUT ALL
OF THE WRONG CORNERS.

39:16.000 --> 39:16.917
I CAME TO YOU FOR HELP

39:16.917 --> 39:18.959
TO GET HIM
OUT OF CIRCULATION.

39:18.959 --> 39:21.041
YOU REFUSED.

39:21.041 --> 39:23.375
NEXT DEAD COP'S ON YOU.

39:30.500 --> 39:32.041
(Dexter)
A DINNER PARTY.

39:32.041 --> 39:33.000
WASHING DISHES.

39:33.000 --> 39:34.959
IT SEEMS SO MUNDANE.

39:34.959 --> 39:37.333
BUT IT'S ODDLY...SOOTHING.

39:37.333 --> 39:39.542
MAYBE THIS IS WHAT
BELONGING FEELS LIKE.

39:39.542 --> 39:41.792
KEEP THIS UP,
WE'RE LOOKING AT DISHPAN HANDS.

39:41.792 --> 39:43.250
(Rita)
I SHOULD ADD RUBBER GLOVES

39:43.250 --> 39:45.583
TO OUR GIFT REGISTRY
FOR DEXTER.

39:45.583 --> 39:46.709
WE CAN DO THAT?

39:46.709 --> 39:48.250
OH, YOU CAN REGISTER
FOR ANYTHING.

39:48.250 --> 39:50.542
FURNITURE, MOTORCYCLES,
POWER TOOLS.

39:50.542 --> 39:51.959
[Dexter and Miguel]
POWER TOOLS.

39:51.959 --> 39:52.917
(crash)

39:52.917 --> 39:54.125
AH, JESUS, SYLVIA!

39:54.125 --> 39:55.667
COME ON, USE YOUR BRAINS,
BABY!

39:55.667 --> 39:57.375
WE JUST GOT
THIS THING RE-STAINED!

39:57.375 --> 39:58.542
I GOT IT.

39:58.542 --> 39:59.542
IT'S FINE.

39:59.542 --> 40:00.750
YEAH.

40:00.750 --> 40:04.250
UH, WHY DON'T SYL AND I
FINISH THE DISHES

40:04.250 --> 40:05.542
AND WE'LL PUT DESSERT
IN THE OVEN?

40:05.542 --> 40:08.041
AND YOU GUYS POP A MOVIE
IN FOR THE KIDS.

40:08.041 --> 40:09.458
UH, YEAH, SOUNDS GOOD.

40:09.458 --> 40:11.208
MOVIE TIME, KIDS.

40:11.208 --> 40:12.458
COME ON, MUCHACHOS.

40:12.458 --> 40:14.667
UNCLE MIGUEL'S GONNA PUT A MOVIE
ON FOR YOU.

40:19.375 --> 40:20.834
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

40:20.834 --> 40:22.125
HE PROBABLY INVITED
YOU GUYS OVER

40:22.125 --> 40:24.000
SO HE WOULDN'T HAVE
TO BE ALONE WITH ME.

40:24.000 --> 40:25.792
THINGS HAVEN'T
GOTTEN ANY BETTER?

40:25.792 --> 40:28.917
WORSE...
AFTER I CONFRONTED HIM.

40:28.917 --> 40:30.125
OH, NO.

40:30.125 --> 40:32.500
HE JUST COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN.

40:32.500 --> 40:34.583
NOW HE CAN'T EVEN BE CIVIL
IN FRONT OF COMPANY.

40:34.583 --> 40:35.917
I'M SO SORRY.

40:35.917 --> 40:37.417
I NEVER SHOULD
HAVE SAID ANYTHING.

40:37.417 --> 40:38.709
NO.

40:38.709 --> 40:40.417
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

40:40.417 --> 40:43.417
MAYBE DEXTER'S
A BAD INFLUENCE ON HIM?

40:43.417 --> 40:44.917
[chuckling]

40:44.917 --> 40:45.917
I KNOW.

40:45.917 --> 40:47.208
WISHFUL THINKING.

40:47.208 --> 40:49.417
HE'D BE A PROBLEM
I COULD ACTUALLY FIX.

40:54.917 --> 40:56.834
(Dexter)
HE'S GOING
TO BRING UP ELLEN WOLF

40:56.834 --> 40:58.792
AND I HAVE TO TELL HIM NO.

40:58.792 --> 41:01.041
CAN FRIENDS DO THAT?

41:01.041 --> 41:02.250
SO, UH, ELLEN WOLF.

41:02.250 --> 41:05.125
PIECE OF WORK, RIGHT?

41:05.125 --> 41:07.000
(Dexter)
GO EASY.

41:07.000 --> 41:08.458
BE TACTFUL.

41:08.458 --> 41:09.750
WE CAN'T KILL HER.

41:09.750 --> 41:12.750
I SEE.

41:12.750 --> 41:15.709
SHE'S...JUST DOING HER JOB.

41:15.709 --> 41:17.875
YOU SHOULD TELL THAT
TO THE PARENTS OF ALL

41:17.875 --> 41:19.834
OF THOSE PEOPLE
THAT HER CLIENTS HAVE KILLED.

41:19.834 --> 41:21.208
YEAH, I READ ABOUT THEM.

41:21.208 --> 41:23.125
I ALSO READ ABOUT
THE WRONGLY CONVICTED PEOPLE

41:23.125 --> 41:25.208
SHE GOT OFF DEATH ROW.

41:25.208 --> 41:26.667
THE DEFENSE FUND
SHE SET UP.

41:26.667 --> 41:28.458
SHE'S FUCKING
WITH THE SYSTEM.

41:28.458 --> 41:30.875
EATING AWAY AT IT
FROM THE INSIDE OUT.

41:30.875 --> 41:33.375
CONTROL, DEXTER.
THAT'S WHAT SHE LIKES.

41:33.375 --> 41:36.250
AND NOW SHE'S TRYING
TO CONTROL ME.

41:36.250 --> 41:38.125
RE-OPENING MY CASES.

41:38.125 --> 41:40.500
UNDERMINING YEARS
OF ALL MY HARD WORK.

41:40.500 --> 41:42.291
SO THIS IS PERSONAL?

41:42.291 --> 41:44.000
FUCK YES,
THIS IS PERSONAL.

41:44.000 --> 41:45.834
AND IT SHOULD BE PERSONAL
FOR YOU TOO.

41:45.834 --> 41:48.250
AS MY FRIEND I'M ASKING
YOU TO DO THIS FOR ME.

41:48.250 --> 41:49.458
I'M SORRY, NO.

41:49.458 --> 41:50.792
WELL, THEN FUCK YOU!

41:52.333 --> 41:54.291
SHE'S FUCKING WITH MY LIFE!

41:59.500 --> 42:01.458
I'M GONNA GO.

42:01.458 --> 42:05.625
I'VE NEVER BEEN GREAT
AT CONFLICT RESOLUTION.

42:05.625 --> 42:10.000
NOT WITHOUT A BLADE AND
SEVERAL ROLLS OF PLASTIC WRAP.

42:10.000 --> 42:12.917
DID DEXTER AND MIGUEL
HAVE A FIGHT?

42:12.917 --> 42:14.291
(Rita)
NO, SWEETIE.

42:14.291 --> 42:17.500
DID YOU?

42:17.500 --> 42:18.542
UH, WHY DON'T YOU GUYS
GO GET READY FOR BED?

42:22.208 --> 42:24.041
SO WHAT HAPPENED?

42:24.041 --> 42:25.959
YOU GRABBED US OUTTA THERE
SO FAST

42:25.959 --> 42:29.417
AND YOU'VE BEEN GRINDING
YOUR TEETH THE WHOLE WAY HOME.

42:29.417 --> 42:31.166
I DISAGREED WITH HIM.

42:31.166 --> 42:33.041
ABOUT THE AFFAIR?

42:33.041 --> 42:34.041
WHAT AFFAIR?

42:34.041 --> 42:35.834
SYL THINKS
THERE'S SOMEONE ELSE.

42:35.834 --> 42:37.542
OH.

42:37.542 --> 42:39.041
HE'S DEFINITELY OBSESSED
WITH SOMEONE

42:39.041 --> 42:40.041
BUT THERE'S NO AFFAIR.

42:40.041 --> 42:41.542
AND THERE'S NOT

42:41.542 --> 42:43.125
GOING TO BE ONE EITHER.

42:43.125 --> 42:44.291
WHAT?

42:44.291 --> 42:46.291
I'M CONFUSING MY METAPHOR.

42:46.291 --> 42:48.417
WELL,
FRIENDS FIGHT SOMETIMES.

42:52.333 --> 42:54.625
I'M NOT SURE HE'D CONSIDER ME
MUCH OF A FRIEND RIGHT NOW.

42:54.625 --> 42:56.709
HEY, YOU'RE A GREAT FRIEND.

42:58.166 --> 43:00.875
THE PROBLEM'S HIS.

43:00.875 --> 43:02.625
WELL, EITHER WAY,

43:02.625 --> 43:04.709
LIFE WAS GOOD BEFORE HIM.

43:04.709 --> 43:07.250
IT'LL BE GOOD AFTER.

43:07.250 --> 43:09.500
IT'S ALL RIGHT
TO BE UPSET.

43:09.500 --> 43:12.041
I'M NOT UPSET.
