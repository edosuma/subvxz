WEBVTT

00:04.504 --> 00:06.923
Braving close enemy fire,
Major Jenkins proceeded

00:07.006 --> 00:10.760
to carry his severely
wounded fellow marine,

00:10.844 --> 00:12.262
all while calling in fire
on the enemy.

00:12.345 --> 00:13.888
He then climbed
down the mountain

00:13.972 --> 00:17.267
for six hours
until they reached

00:17.350 --> 00:20.729
an area where extraction
could be attempted.

00:20.812 --> 00:24.607
His courage,
unwavering leadership

00:24.691 --> 00:27.068
and creative initiative
saved many lives that day.

00:27.152 --> 00:30.071
Major Jenkins has
brought great credit

00:30.155 --> 00:31.239
upon himself and upheld
the highest traditions

00:31.322 --> 00:32.615
of the Marines.

00:32.698 --> 00:35.243
(cameras clicking)

00:35.326 --> 00:37.787
Because of your heroic actions,

00:37.871 --> 00:40.790
ten marines are alive today,

00:40.874 --> 00:43.835
and two fallen American
heroes came home.

00:43.918 --> 00:47.547
God bless you,
Major Brad Jenkins.

00:47.630 --> 00:49.674
God bless our marines
and all those who serve.

00:55.221 --> 00:57.307
Semper fi.

00:57.390 --> 00:59.476
AIDE:
The President of
the United States,

00:59.559 --> 01:01.311
in the name of Congress,

01:01.394 --> 01:05.147
takes pleasure in presenting
the Medal of Honor

01:05.230 --> 01:07.859
to retired Major Brad Jenkins,
United States Marine Corps,

01:07.942 --> 01:11.154
for conspicuous gallantry
and intrepidity

01:11.237 --> 01:13.239
at the risk of his life above
and beyond the call of duty.

01:17.577 --> 01:19.621
(cameras clicking)

01:26.628 --> 01:29.214
♪ ♪

01:30.256 --> 01:32.300
MAN: Oorah!
(woman whoops)

01:32.383 --> 01:34.219
I hope I didn't
talk too long.

01:34.302 --> 01:36.387
I noticed some kids
squirming up front.

01:40.433 --> 01:41.684
Well, they must be mine.
They're hard to impress.
(laughs)

01:41.768 --> 01:43.645
Your first
Medal of Honor ceremony

01:43.728 --> 01:44.646
was every bit as exciting
as I imagined.

01:44.729 --> 01:46.189
Good.

01:46.272 --> 01:47.649
It's a lot of protocol,

01:47.732 --> 01:49.859
and I didn't want
to miss anything.

01:49.943 --> 01:52.403
Oh, you didn't.
And the picnic and the games

01:52.487 --> 01:54.239
for the honorees and their
families will be less stressful.

01:54.322 --> 01:56.282
Well, that's something
fun to look forward to.

01:56.366 --> 01:58.535
And, so happens,

01:58.618 --> 02:00.662
I have a very steady hand
when it comes to an egg race.

02:00.745 --> 02:02.497
Mm. Well, I'll have
to be a cheerleader.

02:02.580 --> 02:04.666
I saw that. What happened?

02:04.749 --> 02:08.169
I got kicked during
a Krav Maga sparring match.

02:08.252 --> 02:10.045
I thought you stopped
seeing the Israeli guy.

02:10.128 --> 02:12.715
Oh, he's gone,
but the Krav Maga stuck around.

02:12.799 --> 02:14.425
Ha.
And just as a reminder,
I won't be available

02:14.509 --> 02:15.760
this afternoon.
I have to go to something

02:16.803 --> 02:19.222
I'm not allowed
to discuss with you.

02:19.305 --> 02:22.851
Ah. Well, good to know.

02:25.478 --> 02:27.355
And good luck with the thing
I know nothing about.

02:27.438 --> 02:28.565
Dr. Henry McCord, just the man
I've been looking for.

02:28.648 --> 02:31.734
Major Jenkins.

02:31.818 --> 02:32.735
May I say congratulations,
and I would like to add oorah.

02:32.819 --> 02:34.279
Yut!

02:34.362 --> 02:36.281
HENRY:
This is my chief of staff,

02:36.364 --> 02:38.366
Captain Evan Moore.

02:38.449 --> 02:39.325
It is a privilege, Major.
Would've been
a damn fine marine,

02:39.409 --> 02:42.287
but Army won that battle.

02:42.370 --> 02:44.914
Afghanistan, Captain?
Three deploys to Iraq.

02:44.998 --> 02:47.917
2nd Battalion 7th Cavalry.

02:48.001 --> 02:50.378
On the fourth tour, I, uh,
met the IED that ended

02:50.461 --> 02:51.754
that part of my career.
Well, I hope the V.A.
came through for you,

02:51.838 --> 02:53.047
unlike some of the veterans
I work with.

02:53.131 --> 02:55.300
Well, let me just say

02:55.383 --> 02:58.094
it's been a privilege getting to
work with Dr. McCord on getting

02:58.177 --> 02:59.429
the V.A. Mental Health
Modernization Bill passed.
Ah, yes.

02:59.512 --> 03:02.307
Modernizing the V.A.

03:02.390 --> 03:03.892
I.T. infrastructure,
expanding and improving

03:03.975 --> 03:05.768
programs to end
homelessness.

03:05.852 --> 03:07.937
This bill's way overdue.
Couldn't agree more.

03:08.021 --> 03:09.606
I work with newly returned vets,
and I can tell you,

03:09.689 --> 03:12.275
some of the red tape
and computer glitches

03:12.358 --> 03:15.445
at the V.A.
can be demoralizing.

03:15.528 --> 03:17.322
I'm afraid I've, uh, cracked

03:17.405 --> 03:19.324
some of the plaster
at the administrative offices

03:19.407 --> 03:20.408
trying to explain that
to them.

03:20.491 --> 03:23.286
It's not the V.A.'s fault.

03:23.369 --> 03:25.330
They're understaffed
and underfunded.

03:27.081 --> 03:28.291
Congress needs to do
their job.

03:28.374 --> 03:30.126
So, if there's anything
I can do--

03:30.209 --> 03:32.503
Hell, I'll even do
public service announcements

03:32.587 --> 03:35.131
wearing my medal
if it'll help pass this bill.

03:35.214 --> 03:36.674
I suppose I don't have to tell
you this, Major, but be careful

03:36.758 --> 03:39.135
what you volunteer for,
and I have a witness.

03:39.218 --> 03:40.929
Oh, with mean follow-through.

03:41.012 --> 03:43.306
Try me.
How would you feel

03:43.389 --> 03:44.515
about addressing the Senate
Veterans' Affairs Committee

03:44.599 --> 03:45.725
this afternoon?

03:45.808 --> 03:48.478
I was scheduled to speak,

03:48.561 --> 03:50.772
but I think you're the guy
they really need to hear from.

03:51.773 --> 03:53.650
Let me at 'em.

04:01.407 --> 04:03.326
I will, uh, notify
the committee.

04:03.409 --> 04:06.120
Hey.

04:06.204 --> 04:09.165
Have you been sitting here
all day?

04:09.248 --> 04:11.167
Not doing your dishes?

04:11.250 --> 04:13.002
Oh, well, the
day's not over.

04:13.086 --> 04:16.673
I will wash them, Mom.

04:16.755 --> 04:18.507
If I were Mom,
I'd wash them for you.

04:18.591 --> 04:20.176
You need to get
out of this apartment.

04:21.427 --> 04:22.845
Clear your mind.

04:24.055 --> 04:27.725
Did you call Stevie?

04:27.809 --> 04:29.560
No. I'm a little preoccupied
with becoming a U.S. citizen.

04:29.644 --> 04:31.020
You know, they don't
make this stuff easy.

04:31.104 --> 04:32.522
Listen to this.

04:32.605 --> 04:34.190
"The Federalist Papers
supported the passage

04:34.274 --> 04:36.526
"of the U.S. Constitution.

04:36.609 --> 04:40.863
Name one of the authors."
Wow.

04:40.947 --> 04:43.658
After you learn that,
are you going to call Stevie?

04:43.741 --> 04:45.576
Look, I-I have three goals
while I'm here:

04:45.660 --> 04:49.497
to become a U.S. citizen,

04:49.580 --> 04:51.541
to get a job, and to-to spend
some time with my sister.

04:51.624 --> 04:53.710
(chuckles softly)
You forgot suffer,

04:53.793 --> 04:55.586
because deep down,
you want to call Stevie,

04:55.670 --> 04:58.214
but you don't.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.049
It's just so... Russian.

05:00.133 --> 05:01.676
I'm-I'm not so sure
she wants to hear from me.

05:01.759 --> 05:03.386
If only there was
a way to find out.

05:03.469 --> 05:06.222
Ah, but then
you'd have to give up

05:06.305 --> 05:09.517
this tortured state and...

05:13.146 --> 05:15.398
really find out
how she feels.

05:15.481 --> 05:17.483
Well, you're right
about one thing.

05:20.278 --> 05:22.196
Should have
done my dishes.

05:22.280 --> 05:23.614
HANSON:
Ms. Grant,
did you ever travel to Iran

05:23.698 --> 05:26.034
as press secretary

05:26.117 --> 05:27.201
to then Secretary of State
Elizabeth McCord?

05:27.285 --> 05:29.037
DAISY:
No.

05:29.120 --> 05:31.122
But I did meet the
Iranian delegation

05:31.205 --> 05:33.583
when they came here for
the signing of the treaty.

05:33.666 --> 05:35.626
Can you tell me if you got
to know any Iranian nationals

05:35.710 --> 05:36.836
during their time here?
Yes.

05:36.919 --> 05:39.714
Because of my work,
I dealt mostly

05:39.797 --> 05:41.799
with the Iranian reporters
who were here for the signing,

05:41.883 --> 05:43.593
but I haven't really kept
in touch with any of them.

05:43.676 --> 05:45.511
HANSON:
Surely some of them
reached out to you

05:45.595 --> 05:47.346
after they returned to Iran?

05:48.973 --> 05:51.809
Just a few
"nice to meet you" e-mails.

05:51.893 --> 05:55.772
Ms. Grant, why don't you
tell us about the night

05:56.814 --> 05:59.609
you were arrested
for assaulting a man in a bar.

05:59.692 --> 06:01.152
Okay. Fine.

06:01.235 --> 06:03.488
The campaign had just finished

06:03.571 --> 06:05.615
an exhausting bus tour
through New England.

06:05.698 --> 06:08.534
BLAKE:
Oh, I got one.
I got one. (laughs)

06:08.618 --> 06:10.870
"Secretary McCord,
looking pale and drawn,

06:10.953 --> 06:12.789
took to the stage
this afternoon."
(Daisy groans)

06:12.872 --> 06:14.457
Yeah, translation:
the woman candidate

06:14.540 --> 06:16.667
walked off her bus
after a nap

06:16.751 --> 06:19.879
and didn't refresh
her makeup. Please.
Mm-hmm.

06:19.962 --> 06:21.631
Or how about the question
TV news anchors love to ask:

06:21.714 --> 06:22.965
Is she tough enough?
Is she tough enough?

06:23.049 --> 06:24.467
I don't-- This is what
I don't understand.

06:24.550 --> 06:28.096
She's a former CIA operative

06:28.179 --> 06:29.972
who survived a bombing and
an attempted coup in Iran.

06:30.056 --> 06:31.474
Mm-hmm.
Meanwhile, most
members of Congress

06:31.557 --> 06:33.434
can't even mow their lawn.

06:33.518 --> 06:35.645
Why don't they just come
out with it and say,

06:35.728 --> 06:37.438
"Why can't we go back to
the good old days when women

06:37.522 --> 06:39.982
"and cattle
could be used as currency

06:40.066 --> 06:42.610
and then burned as witches
when they got too saucy?"

06:45.571 --> 06:47.824
Not the cattle,
unless it's barbecue sauce.

06:47.907 --> 06:49.492
Oh, that's too dark for
you tadpoles? Okay, I'm out.

06:49.575 --> 06:50.618
See you tomorrow. Early.
BLAKE:
Good night.

06:50.701 --> 06:52.120
Bye.
Yeah, yeah.

06:52.203 --> 06:53.162
DAISY: Nina was working
at the State Department

06:53.246 --> 06:54.664
and wasn't a part
of the campaign.

06:54.747 --> 06:55.665
Oh, she's here.

06:55.748 --> 06:58.334
But since we were in town,

06:58.417 --> 06:59.502
we invited her
to join us out for a drink.

06:59.585 --> 07:01.003
BLAKE:
How about the-the
reporter the other day

07:01.087 --> 07:03.506
who was talking
about the "tidiness"

07:03.589 --> 07:05.049
of the, uh, campaign bus.
Where you going, sweetheart?

07:05.133 --> 07:07.009
Who you here to see?
Me? Let me buy you a drink.
Sorry? Oh.

07:07.093 --> 07:08.678
No, I'm not here to see you.
I see my friends, actually.

07:08.761 --> 07:11.180
Hi.
Hey, wait a second.
Those glasses...

07:11.264 --> 07:12.348
BLAKE:
Cleanliness of a male
candidate's campaign bus?

07:12.431 --> 07:13.808
WOMAN:
And it really wasn't
even that tidy.

07:13.891 --> 07:15.810
We all remember the smell.

07:15.893 --> 07:17.645
Nina. (laughs)
Those glasses really bring
out the color of your eyes.

07:17.728 --> 07:19.772
Hi! (laughs)
Glad you could make it.

07:19.856 --> 07:21.691
Oh, no, no. Hey, hey.
Ready for a drink?

07:21.774 --> 07:22.859
It's okay. I got it.
Uh, maybe later.

07:22.942 --> 07:24.861
She's here to meet us.
Yeah.

07:24.944 --> 07:27.697
Oh, I get it.

07:27.780 --> 07:28.990
Hey, I'm cool with that,
if I can watch.

07:29.073 --> 07:31.159
Okay. Bye.
Oh, no, no, no. Sorry.

07:31.242 --> 07:32.535
Good night.
Hey, you're both--
I mean, you're both really hot.

07:32.618 --> 07:34.162
Bye. Ew.
Oh, come on!

07:34.245 --> 07:35.538
Stop being bitches about it.

07:35.621 --> 07:37.373
Oh, my God.
Hey.

07:37.456 --> 07:39.000
I'm talking to you!
(grunts)

07:39.083 --> 07:40.751
(Nina screams)

07:40.835 --> 07:42.962
(Nina gasps, people murmuring)

07:43.963 --> 07:45.715
MAN:
You see that? Geez.

07:45.798 --> 07:47.758
Help!

07:47.842 --> 07:49.594
WOMAN:
See if he's all right.
Someone call 911!

07:49.677 --> 07:51.596
MAN:
It's all right, we got him.
Someone call the police!

07:51.679 --> 07:53.890
Oh!
DAISY: It was a reflex.

07:53.973 --> 07:57.018
I had been studying Krav Maga,
and they train you

07:57.101 --> 07:59.770
to react to being grabbed
from behind, which I was.

07:59.854 --> 08:01.022
Of course, the police
and an ambulance came.

08:01.105 --> 08:02.356
The paramedics

08:02.440 --> 08:04.275
refused to take the guy,

08:04.358 --> 08:06.027
but the police brought
me in for questioning

08:06.110 --> 08:07.778
because there was
a lot of blood.

08:08.821 --> 08:10.740
And screaming.

08:10.823 --> 08:13.075
I think we're done
for this session.

08:14.327 --> 08:16.704
Resume tomorrow, same time.

08:16.787 --> 08:17.872
Is it, uh, too much
to wear the medal?

08:17.955 --> 08:19.832
No, no.

08:19.916 --> 08:22.960
Not many of these guys
have seen combat,

08:24.212 --> 08:25.588
so it might help to get
their full attention.

08:25.671 --> 08:28.090
Lorraine.

08:28.174 --> 08:30.593
Dr. Henry McCord and
Major Brad Jenkins here

08:30.676 --> 08:31.552
to give their testimony
before the committee.
Oh.

08:31.636 --> 08:33.929
Dr. McCord,
I called your office,

08:34.013 --> 08:35.139
but you had already left.
I'm so sorry.

08:35.222 --> 08:36.933
The committee
adjourned for the day.

08:37.015 --> 08:37.933
What? Nobody called my cell.

08:38.017 --> 08:38.934
Typical.

08:39.018 --> 08:41.270
EVAN:
We confirmed with

08:41.354 --> 08:43.813
Senator Peoples' office
less than an hour ago.

08:43.898 --> 08:45.775
I'm just so sorry.
HENRY:
Okay.

08:45.858 --> 08:47.443
Thank you. Uh, Brad, I will get
to the bottom of this.

08:47.526 --> 08:48.611
This is dirty politics, Henry.

08:48.694 --> 08:50.905
It could well be.

08:50.988 --> 08:53.824
This is how vets are treated
every day in this country.

08:53.908 --> 08:56.661
All this "thank you
for your service" crap.

08:56.744 --> 09:00.289
I'd trade
every superficial platitude

09:00.373 --> 09:02.458
for just one minute of evidence
that somebody somewhere cares.

09:02.541 --> 09:04.919
But you know what?
They don't.

09:05.002 --> 09:06.462
You guys are vets.
You know it's the truth.

09:06.545 --> 09:08.506
I understand how you feel.

09:08.589 --> 09:09.966
I'm sick of that one, too.

09:10.049 --> 09:12.343
Call me
when somebody around here

09:14.679 --> 09:17.431
gets serious
about doing something.

09:17.515 --> 09:18.808
Sir, Dr. Henry McCord
would like a word.

09:18.891 --> 09:20.184
Dr. McCord.

09:20.268 --> 09:21.811
Thank you, Alma.
(door closes)

09:21.894 --> 09:24.438
HENRY:
Senator, you owe
me an explanation.

09:24.522 --> 09:26.774
I requested to bring a war hero
before your committee.

09:26.857 --> 09:29.193
What the hell happened?

09:29.277 --> 09:31.487
Look, I'm sorry. I really am.

09:31.570 --> 09:33.322
I called your office...
No, I don't want to hear

09:35.241 --> 09:37.368
about scheduling conflicts.

09:37.451 --> 09:40.329
Just tell me the truth.

09:40.413 --> 09:42.790
You're right.
You're entitled to that.

09:42.873 --> 09:44.166
I was advised to cancel
Major Jenkins' appearance

09:44.250 --> 09:46.460
by someone at the White House.

09:46.544 --> 09:47.837
The White House?

09:47.920 --> 09:50.339
Who?

09:54.302 --> 09:56.345
Vice President Morejon.

10:07.732 --> 10:08.983
♪ ♪

10:11.777 --> 10:13.779
Go! Go, go, go!
(excited chatter)

10:15.114 --> 10:18.034
(cheering)

10:18.117 --> 10:19.368
Molly, where'd
you come from?
Back there.

10:19.452 --> 10:22.246
Go, Molly!

10:22.330 --> 10:23.998
I am really good at this, you
know that? Wait, whoa, whoa!
Me, too.

10:24.081 --> 10:25.666
Molly!

10:25.750 --> 10:27.752
(cheering)

10:27.835 --> 10:29.253
I thought I was gonna
win. You smoked me.

10:29.337 --> 10:30.713
Second place is pretty good.

10:30.796 --> 10:32.173
Thank you, Molly.

10:32.256 --> 10:34.884
That was cute.

10:34.967 --> 10:36.886
(laughs)
What do you really mean?
Pointless.

10:36.969 --> 10:39.055
Ah.
You have
a veteran's bill to pass,

10:39.138 --> 10:40.848
this lawn is literally crawling
with decorated heroes

10:40.931 --> 10:42.558
and their kids, and the press
is nowhere to be found.

10:42.641 --> 10:44.226
This is not about
the press, Mike.

10:44.310 --> 10:46.103
I'm sorry, I can't...
I can't hear you,

10:46.187 --> 10:48.356
like I can't hear a tree
falling in the woods

10:48.439 --> 10:50.733
because there's
no photographer or anyone.

10:50.816 --> 10:52.568
So no one's gonna be able
to help the tree

10:52.651 --> 10:55.279
when the Veterans'
Affairs Committee...

10:55.363 --> 10:56.739
Just... you know
I'm right. Just...
Oh!

10:56.822 --> 10:58.574
Popcorn.
Don't...

10:58.657 --> 11:01.243
Have a good time, Mike.
Don't bring popcorn.

11:01.327 --> 11:03.704
Could you just
hold that? Thanks.

11:03.788 --> 11:04.914
Look! Look at this!
It's for nothing.

11:04.997 --> 11:06.248
It's all for nothing!

11:06.332 --> 11:07.500
Right? No one... no one saw.

11:07.583 --> 11:09.043
No one saw.

11:09.126 --> 11:10.086
Hey, Russell.

11:10.169 --> 11:12.088
I'm having a hot dog.

11:12.171 --> 11:13.255
I don't care if it kills me.

11:13.339 --> 11:15.299
Hear what happened

11:15.383 --> 11:18.260
at the Veterans' Affairs
Committee meeting?

11:18.344 --> 11:20.096
Just that Brad Jenkins was gonna
take your speaking slot,

11:20.179 --> 11:22.181
address the committee.

11:22.264 --> 11:23.974
Senator Peoples
cancelled it.

11:24.058 --> 11:26.644
I confronted him
and he told me

11:26.727 --> 11:28.437
that the vice president told him
not to let Major Jenkins speak.

11:29.397 --> 11:31.315
(sighs)

11:31.399 --> 11:33.275
Thanks. Look, I know that

11:33.359 --> 11:36.278
Elizabeth and Carlos
have an agreement.

11:36.362 --> 11:38.447
He doesn't have to fall in line
with every policy she supports.

11:38.531 --> 11:40.282
But he's not supposed
to publicly oppose her, either.

11:40.366 --> 11:43.994
Well, I got to
tell you, Henry,

11:44.078 --> 11:44.954
technically, Carlos did this
behind the scenes, not publicly.

11:45.037 --> 11:46.622
You're honestly gonna tell me

11:46.705 --> 11:48.791
that this in the spirit
of the arrangement?

11:48.874 --> 11:50.459
I don't know what the hell
this arrangement is.

11:50.543 --> 11:53.587
It's never been done before,

11:53.671 --> 11:55.589
so it's still being... arranged.

11:55.673 --> 11:57.466
I'm gonna talk to
the vice president.

11:57.550 --> 11:59.093
Major Jenkins
should be heard.

11:59.176 --> 12:02.388
And it will
help the bill.

12:02.471 --> 12:05.641
Much like eating this hot dog,
I think that's a bad idea.

12:05.724 --> 12:07.935
Talking to the vice president
risks angering him enough

12:08.018 --> 12:10.479
to go public
with his views on the bill.

12:10.563 --> 12:12.189
Then add to that
this ridiculous

12:12.273 --> 12:14.442
Senate Intelligence
investigation.

12:14.525 --> 12:16.569
The next thing you know,
everyone will be saying

12:18.529 --> 12:20.531
we're a White House in chaos.

12:23.367 --> 12:25.161
Now I don't even want
this hot dog.

12:25.244 --> 12:26.912
Hey, hey, hey, check
it out. Look, look, look.

12:26.996 --> 12:28.664
Check it out.
If we get this one
Whoa.

12:28.747 --> 12:30.666
we can make a main
dish on the one burner

12:30.750 --> 12:32.793
and still be able to heat up
a side on the other one, huh?

12:32.877 --> 12:36.172
Main dish? Side dish?
Are you the same man
Yeah.

12:36.255 --> 12:38.215
who wanted to buy
the Avenging Angel Survival Kit?

12:38.299 --> 12:39.967
All right, look, I'm...
I'm a very complicated,

12:40.050 --> 12:43.012
yet simple camper, see?

12:43.095 --> 12:44.805
You sound like you are a camper
who doesn't camp.

12:44.889 --> 12:46.849
OMG.
You're Stevie McCord.

12:46.932 --> 12:48.184
I love your mom.
My whole family does.

12:48.267 --> 12:50.019
I do, too.

12:50.102 --> 12:51.312
Can I take a selfie
with you?

12:51.395 --> 12:53.314
My parents will
literally die.

12:53.397 --> 12:55.524
They both campaigned
for her.

12:56.609 --> 12:58.402
Of course.
Let's do it.

12:58.486 --> 13:00.196
Tell your mom hi for me.

13:00.279 --> 13:02.364
Do you mind
if I post this?

13:02.448 --> 13:04.450
Oh, no. Not at all.
Go for it, yeah.

13:04.533 --> 13:06.869
Bye.
Thanks for asking. Bye.

13:06.952 --> 13:09.371
Hey, got to
have it, right?

13:09.455 --> 13:10.706
Yes. What is it?

13:10.789 --> 13:12.374
Though Senator Peoples
and I share

13:12.458 --> 13:15.336
the same party affiliation,

13:15.419 --> 13:17.379
I would never interfere
with how he runs his committee.

13:17.463 --> 13:20.216
I mean, I did share
with him my feeling that

13:20.299 --> 13:21.759
we should delay the markup
and consideration of the bill

13:21.842 --> 13:23.177
until the merits
of vets choosing

13:23.260 --> 13:26.430
their own health care specialist

13:26.514 --> 13:28.557
outside the V.A. system
is fully explained.

13:28.641 --> 13:30.559
Brad Jenkins is in
the trenches every day

13:30.643 --> 13:33.229
dealing with service
members who...
Henry, I'm sorry.

13:33.312 --> 13:35.606
I think what we need here
is rational debate,

13:35.689 --> 13:37.233
not grandstanding
with a Medal of Honor recipient.

13:37.316 --> 13:39.735
Come on. This is
a guy, who,

13:39.818 --> 13:42.446
in addition to his
real-world knowledge,

13:42.530 --> 13:44.698
uh, is well-versed
in public policy.

13:44.782 --> 13:46.909
And I mean no disrespect
to the major.

13:46.992 --> 13:49.411
I'm-I'm just saying, I believe

13:49.495 --> 13:53.207
that those that have sacrificed

13:53.290 --> 13:55.292
for our freedom deserve
to have the freedom themselves

13:55.376 --> 13:57.461
to choose how and where
they get their care.

13:57.545 --> 13:58.337
Privatization is cheaper, right?

13:58.420 --> 14:01.048
Is that what
this is about?

14:01.131 --> 14:03.467
It's part of every bill,
as it should be.

14:03.551 --> 14:05.261
Look, the president's ESI bill
did not turn out

14:05.344 --> 14:06.762
to be revenue neutral
as promised.

14:06.845 --> 14:08.764
We cannot have that again.

14:08.847 --> 14:10.766
I mean no disrespect
to the major or to you.

14:10.849 --> 14:12.268
I have my reservations
about the bill.

14:12.351 --> 14:14.603
Elizabeth knows about it.

14:14.687 --> 14:17.439
Elizabeth didn't bring
an expert to a committee

14:17.523 --> 14:19.275
only to have the door
shut in her face.

14:19.358 --> 14:20.776
I'm sorry it felt that way.

14:22.528 --> 14:25.114
It was not intended.

14:25.197 --> 14:27.116
Okay, now, bear spray-- that
seems like a no-brainer, right?

14:27.199 --> 14:29.785
Mm-hmm.
Unless you prefer
the bear bell.

14:29.868 --> 14:32.746
Oh, yeah.

14:32.830 --> 14:34.164
And... if you hate birds,

14:34.248 --> 14:35.958
there is bird repellent.

14:36.041 --> 14:37.418
What?
(both laugh)

14:37.501 --> 14:38.627
Wow.

14:38.711 --> 14:40.254
There's also not camping.

14:40.337 --> 14:41.297
Just another option.

14:41.380 --> 14:42.298
Uh, no, not an option.

14:42.381 --> 14:43.716
We are committed to this.

14:43.799 --> 14:46.594
I'm just saying.
Geez.

14:46.677 --> 14:48.304
You know, why go camping
if you hate birds?

14:48.387 --> 14:50.306
GRIFFIN:
Okay, let's just get into

14:50.389 --> 14:51.599
the, uh, camping mind frame.

14:53.017 --> 14:55.477
All right, let's pick...
Stevie?

14:55.561 --> 14:57.479
I-I am Talia,
Dmitri's sister?

14:57.563 --> 14:59.565
Oh, my God.

15:00.608 --> 15:02.693
Sorry. One second.

15:02.776 --> 15:04.486
I can't believe
we have never met.

15:04.570 --> 15:06.196
Me too.
I've seen pictures of you.

15:06.280 --> 15:08.157
Me too.
Wow.

15:08.240 --> 15:09.658
Uh, how funny
to run into you.

15:09.742 --> 15:12.328
Yeah.
I just came in to
get a flashlight.

15:12.411 --> 15:14.830
Oh, well, they have
a mind-boggling variety.

15:14.913 --> 15:16.582
Um... how's Dmitri?

15:16.665 --> 15:18.292
He's fine.

15:18.375 --> 15:21.295
Good. Listen,

15:21.378 --> 15:24.465
um, I can't believe
how lucky this is.

15:24.548 --> 15:27.343
Uh, I've been invited
to attend a roundtable

15:27.426 --> 15:29.845
of hospital executives
and health care workers

15:29.928 --> 15:33.474
to discuss health services
for poor communities.

15:33.557 --> 15:35.392
Oh, wow.
I know you work for
a human rights group.

15:35.476 --> 15:37.853
I bet you have
some insights.

15:37.936 --> 15:40.522
Yeah, actually, we are working
on a program right now

15:40.606 --> 15:42.524
that is geared toward
mothers without insurance.

15:42.608 --> 15:45.027
Oh. My God.

15:45.110 --> 15:48.697
That's exactly the kind of
thing we're trying to improve.

15:48.781 --> 15:53.202
I hate to be pushy, but
the roundtable is tomorrow.

15:53.285 --> 15:55.871
Any chance we can have a drink
or coffee this evening?

15:55.954 --> 15:58.374
Uh, just a half an hour
or so would be incredible.

15:58.457 --> 16:01.543
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, I can do that.

16:01.627 --> 16:04.046
Um, here.
Just, if you give me

16:04.129 --> 16:05.673
your number,
I'll text you later.

16:07.633 --> 16:08.550
(laughs)

16:08.634 --> 16:10.010
(gavel bangs)

16:10.094 --> 16:11.595
HANSON:
Resuming the testimony

16:11.679 --> 16:13.555
of Daisy Grant.

16:13.639 --> 16:15.599
Can you tell us,
Ms. Grant, why no charges

16:15.683 --> 16:17.393
were filed against you
even though you were taken

16:17.476 --> 16:19.019
to the police station
for that purpose?

16:19.103 --> 16:21.397
Because I was cleared
of wrongdoing,

16:21.480 --> 16:23.273
which the police determined
after they were given a video

16:23.357 --> 16:25.442
taken by a patron at the bar.

16:25.526 --> 16:26.944
I have the police report
here, and it states

16:27.027 --> 16:28.445
that you informed
the police

16:28.529 --> 16:32.491
that you worked for
Secretary McCord.

16:32.574 --> 16:35.035
So really that's... that's
why the police let you go.

16:35.119 --> 16:37.037
The term for it is
"color of office."

16:37.121 --> 16:40.374
You abused your position.

16:40.457 --> 16:43.585
Okay, that...
that is not what happened.

16:43.669 --> 16:45.295
And what is your occupation?

16:45.379 --> 16:47.548
I'm a press secretary.

16:47.631 --> 16:49.091
What is the address
of your place of employment?

16:49.174 --> 16:50.551
No, it's actually a bus.

16:50.634 --> 16:51.969
I'm mostly
on the road.

16:52.052 --> 16:53.971
Who is your employer,
Ms. Grant?

16:54.054 --> 16:55.097
Is this necessary information?

16:55.180 --> 16:56.306
I mean, my employer
wasn't involved.

16:56.390 --> 16:57.599
Why do you need to know?

16:57.683 --> 16:59.727
You just assaulted

16:59.810 --> 17:02.104
and inflicted injury
on a man in a bar.

17:02.187 --> 17:04.189
It might be in
your best interest to cooperate

17:06.650 --> 17:08.986
with the police, ma'am.

17:09.069 --> 17:10.738
I'm the press secretary
for Elizabeth McCord

17:10.820 --> 17:13.449
and her presidential campaign.

17:13.531 --> 17:15.367
But I still don't see what
this has to do with anything.

17:16.367 --> 17:18.119
I got to fill out
these forms, Ms. Grant.

17:18.203 --> 17:20.789
(scoffs)

17:20.873 --> 17:24.460
OLIVIA:
Senator, no color
of office existed.

17:24.542 --> 17:26.170
Elizabeth McCord was
no longer secretary of state

17:26.252 --> 17:27.588
and had not been elected
president.

17:27.671 --> 17:28.630
And Ms. Grant was no longer

17:28.714 --> 17:30.632
a federal employee.

17:37.890 --> 17:40.434
(woman clears throat)

17:40.517 --> 17:42.478
I think we will end
this session here.

17:42.561 --> 17:43.812
Thank you both.
You are excused.

17:43.896 --> 17:45.564
(gavel bangs)

17:45.647 --> 17:47.024
(gallery murmuring)

17:47.107 --> 17:48.692
(piano playing)

18:07.211 --> 18:09.213
(indistinct conversations)

18:18.055 --> 18:19.348
Wha...

18:19.431 --> 18:22.810
Oh.

18:26.230 --> 18:28.148
It... It's fine.
He's, um, a friend.

18:28.232 --> 18:30.067
Hi. I...

18:30.150 --> 18:32.194
I can't believe
that you're here.

18:32.277 --> 18:33.737
Um, Talia didn't tell me

18:33.821 --> 18:35.697
that you were...
That she was setting us up?

18:35.781 --> 18:38.075
Yeah.
Uh, yeah, she told me
to meet her here

18:38.158 --> 18:41.870
so that I could, uh,
approve a new guy she's dating.

18:41.954 --> 18:44.373
Mm. She knew how
to get you here.

18:44.456 --> 18:46.542
Uh, my sister watches
too many romcoms.

18:46.625 --> 18:49.169
(short chuckle)

18:52.756 --> 18:54.550
Sit, please.
Sit down. Sit.

18:54.633 --> 18:57.386
How long have
you been back?

18:57.469 --> 19:00.639
Uh... a couple of weeks.

19:00.722 --> 19:02.891
Um, because of the treaty,
it's now safe for me.

19:02.975 --> 19:05.561
Oh.
But I'm not really here
for good.

19:05.644 --> 19:07.855
I'm just, uh, I'm studying
to become a citizen.

19:07.938 --> 19:09.690
Um, I'm staying
with my sister.

19:09.773 --> 19:12.234
Mm-hmm.
And I may kill her after this,

19:13.610 --> 19:15.696
so that... that might interfere
with the process.

19:15.779 --> 19:18.991
So, she was coming

19:19.992 --> 19:21.785
to the camping
store to find... me?

19:21.869 --> 19:23.704
I'm sorry. Uh...
(laughs)

19:23.787 --> 19:26.623
She probably stalked you
on social media.

19:27.624 --> 19:29.585
Uh... a good spy.

19:29.668 --> 19:32.754
Runs in the family.

19:34.798 --> 19:35.966
So... was I gonna
hear from you?

19:36.049 --> 19:39.303
I-I wasn't sure.

19:41.346 --> 19:42.931
Uh... I-I knew
you were seeing someone.

19:43.015 --> 19:44.349
I might occasionally
look at your Instagram.

19:44.433 --> 19:48.228
Right.

19:48.312 --> 19:50.439
Yeah. I mean,
that's-that's... allowed.

19:50.522 --> 19:52.649
Um...

19:52.733 --> 19:53.650
What about you?
Are you...

19:53.734 --> 19:55.444
seeing anyone?

19:55.527 --> 19:56.820
Are you kidding?

19:56.904 --> 19:59.072
You wouldn't believe
the big social scene

19:59.156 --> 20:01.575
at the-at the
listening station in Alaska.

20:01.658 --> 20:04.453
Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah, uh,
sometimes the parties--

20:04.536 --> 20:06.914
they lasted all night,
which gets crazy in the winter,

20:08.332 --> 20:10.751
because night lasts all day.

20:10.834 --> 20:12.836
So... no?
No.

20:12.920 --> 20:16.840
(both laugh)
Okay.

20:17.841 --> 20:19.760
You-You've been seeing
this guy a long time?

20:19.843 --> 20:22.304
No, not very long. Um...

20:22.387 --> 20:24.765
Yeah, we're going...

20:24.848 --> 20:26.683
camping this weekend

20:26.767 --> 20:29.686
at Shenandoah
National Park.

20:29.770 --> 20:31.688
So if we survive
that, I guess it's...

20:31.772 --> 20:33.357
it's officially
a relationship.

20:33.440 --> 20:35.150
(laughs)

20:35.233 --> 20:37.319
Sounds like fun.

20:37.402 --> 20:39.154
Mm-hmm.
But if you see

20:39.237 --> 20:41.240
a bear, just don't
look him in the eye.

20:42.240 --> 20:43.659
Or do.
I can't remember.

20:43.742 --> 20:44.826
Uh, well, we have
a bear bell.

20:44.910 --> 20:45.827
A bear... horn?
Bell...

20:45.911 --> 20:47.996
Yeah.
No, I'm not sure.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.498
Just don't see a bear. That...
Yeah, that's...

20:49.581 --> 20:51.792
(laughs)
Might be better.

20:51.875 --> 20:54.169
It's great advice.
Great advice.

20:54.252 --> 20:55.712
(door opens)
ELIZABETH:
Were you on

20:55.796 --> 20:56.797
with Brad Jenkins
that whole time?

20:56.880 --> 20:58.048
HENRY:
Yeah.

20:58.131 --> 21:00.717
To say he's really passionate

21:00.801 --> 21:03.011
about the V.A. bill
is an understatement.

21:03.095 --> 21:05.347
Well, now you're
here, I need you.

21:05.430 --> 21:08.266
I like the sound of that.

21:08.350 --> 21:10.227
Will you do that thing
you do to my shoulders?

21:10.310 --> 21:12.312
It's...
Oh.

21:12.396 --> 21:13.855
Well, don't look
so disappointed.

21:13.939 --> 21:15.732
(sighs)

21:15.816 --> 21:18.860
Magic shoulder rubs
have been known

21:18.944 --> 21:20.278
to lead to better things.

21:20.362 --> 21:22.864
I serve at the pleasure.

21:22.948 --> 21:24.741
(sighs)
Oh!

21:24.825 --> 21:27.202
So...
Mm.

21:27.285 --> 21:30.247
Brad gave me
his numbers--

21:30.330 --> 21:32.666
87, 12 and ten.

21:32.749 --> 21:35.711
That's 87 enemy
combatants killed

21:35.794 --> 21:36.503
and the collaterals--
12 women, ten children.

21:36.586 --> 21:39.047
Oh.
(exhales)

21:40.632 --> 21:42.509
He has to live
with that every day.

21:42.592 --> 21:44.720
Well, you know
something about that.

21:44.803 --> 21:47.389
Well, yeah, I
was dropping bombs,

21:47.472 --> 21:50.892
but I wasn't there
on the ground.

21:50.976 --> 21:52.936
So, I have an understanding
of Brad's passion

21:53.020 --> 21:54.229
for this modernization bill,

21:54.312 --> 21:56.231
and it makes me even angrier
at Carlos

21:56.314 --> 21:57.524
for not letting him talk
to the committee.

21:57.607 --> 21:59.526
I'm sorry about Carlos.

21:59.609 --> 22:01.737
But you know my deal with him.

22:01.820 --> 22:04.114
He gets to have
his own voice.
Yeah, but it was embarrassing.

22:04.197 --> 22:05.741
Brad was clearly
humiliated.

22:05.824 --> 22:07.409
Well, look,

22:07.492 --> 22:09.119
with or without Carlos,

22:09.202 --> 22:10.746
we're gonna figure out a way
to get this bill

22:10.829 --> 22:12.706
over the finish line.

22:13.707 --> 22:15.250
(groans)
Over to the left.

22:16.835 --> 22:17.961
I thought we had the left.

22:18.045 --> 22:19.963
No.

22:20.047 --> 22:20.964
You, over to the left.
Oh, oh.

22:21.048 --> 22:21.965
That's... Yeah.

22:22.049 --> 22:23.967
How's that?

22:24.051 --> 22:27.596
So good.

22:27.679 --> 22:28.764
I'm actually having lunch with
Senator Peoples of Kentucky.

22:28.847 --> 22:30.432
(sighs)
I can't believe

22:30.515 --> 22:32.434
that guy's chairman of
the Veterans' Affairs Committee.

22:32.517 --> 22:35.020
But good. Great.
Yeah.

22:35.103 --> 22:36.772
I think he just needs
a little... shove

22:36.855 --> 22:37.773
to get the bill out
of committee.

22:37.856 --> 22:39.608
He sure does.

22:39.691 --> 22:41.777
Yeah.

22:41.860 --> 22:43.945
Babe.
Oh.

22:44.029 --> 22:46.031
I've got a meeting
tomorrow with Brad

22:46.114 --> 22:47.783
and a couple other
veteran activists

22:47.866 --> 22:49.076
to go over the media
campaign for the bill.

22:49.159 --> 22:50.285
I got to go write
down some thoughts.

22:50.368 --> 22:52.079
Okay. Will you come back?

22:52.162 --> 22:53.080
Always.
(chuckles softly)

22:53.163 --> 22:55.290
(door opens)
(chuckles)

22:55.373 --> 22:57.000
(sighs)
Hey. Sorry.

22:57.084 --> 22:58.960
Uh, am I interrupting
something?

22:59.044 --> 23:00.587
I can...
(chuckles)
No, no, no.

23:00.670 --> 23:03.006
I just came to borrow
your hiking boots.

23:03.090 --> 23:04.382
It's the only thing that,
uh, I forgot to get

23:04.466 --> 23:05.801
on my list.
Hiking?

23:05.884 --> 23:07.636
Griffin and I are going
camping this weekend.

23:07.719 --> 23:09.638
It's, like, a whole
ordeal. (chuckles)

23:09.721 --> 23:11.807
It would actually just be
cheaper at this point

23:11.890 --> 23:14.017
to check into
a Four Seasons.
(chuckles)

23:15.894 --> 23:18.939
Um, hey, did you guys know
that Dmitri was back in town?

23:19.022 --> 23:20.148
(stammers) Well, I-I knew he
was free to leave his post,

23:20.232 --> 23:21.149
but I didn't know he was here.

23:21.233 --> 23:22.150
Yeah.

23:22.234 --> 23:23.485
I ran into him.

23:23.568 --> 23:25.362
Uh, it's a long story.

23:25.445 --> 23:27.823
But he's doing well.

23:27.906 --> 23:30.033
Well, that's good.
Yeah. No,

23:30.117 --> 23:31.493
you should've seen me and
Griffin at this camping store.

23:31.576 --> 23:34.037
It was like...
(chuckles)

23:34.121 --> 23:35.038
I mean, we were
totally clueless,

23:35.122 --> 23:36.039
and there's so
much weird stuff.

23:36.123 --> 23:37.833
I mean, it was
hilarious.

23:37.916 --> 23:41.628
There was
this-this thing.

23:41.711 --> 23:42.879
It was called
a-a personal cooling system.

23:42.963 --> 23:44.005
Right?

23:44.089 --> 23:46.800
What is that?
(chuckles)

23:46.883 --> 23:48.176
I mean, it's a good thing that
my Secret Service agents

23:48.260 --> 23:50.178
have, like,
camping experience,

23:50.262 --> 23:51.555
'cause there's now
an excellent chance

23:51.638 --> 23:53.014
that we will actually
survive. (chuckles)

23:53.098 --> 23:53.890
That's always nice to hear.

23:53.974 --> 23:55.767
Yeah.

23:55.851 --> 23:56.685
Okay.

23:56.768 --> 23:57.894
Stevie?
Yeah.

23:57.978 --> 23:58.895
Boots?

23:58.979 --> 24:00.564
What?

24:00.647 --> 24:02.899
Hiking boots?

24:02.983 --> 24:05.026
Oh. Yeah. Where are they?

24:05.110 --> 24:05.986
Out in that
hall closet.

24:06.069 --> 24:08.363
Thanks.

24:08.446 --> 24:10.615
(door closes)

24:10.699 --> 24:13.910
Is it just me

24:15.453 --> 24:18.915
or do you think
she was overselling a bit?

24:18.999 --> 24:20.333
I think we're gonna
try not to think about it.

24:20.417 --> 24:22.669
(chuckles)
(grunts)

24:22.752 --> 24:25.672
Good luck with that.

24:25.755 --> 24:29.050
BLAKE:
Conveniently,
as if it were planned,

24:29.134 --> 24:30.760
your lunch with Senator Peoples
cannot extend past 12:45,

24:30.844 --> 24:34.389
because, at 1:00, you have

24:34.472 --> 24:38.059
a photo op with Scotland's
champion Highland fling dancers.

24:38.143 --> 24:39.686
Saved by a prior
fling dancing commitment.

24:39.769 --> 24:41.271
Yes.
You're a genius. Hello!

24:41.354 --> 24:42.898
Senator Peoples,
right on time.

24:42.981 --> 24:44.065
Well, I'd be a fool
to be late

24:44.149 --> 24:47.652
for a date
with the commander in chief.

24:47.736 --> 24:49.738
And to celebrate, I brought
along a bottle of Blue Lid.

24:49.821 --> 24:51.072
My family's been making it
since the Prohibition.

24:51.156 --> 24:53.241
Well, considering
where you're from,

24:53.325 --> 24:54.868
I'm... thinking bourbon?
A worthy guess,

24:54.951 --> 24:56.036
but incorrect.

24:56.119 --> 24:56.953
It's a stout ale.

24:57.037 --> 24:57.954
But we do have
some lovely

24:58.038 --> 24:59.956
parting gifts for the president.

25:01.166 --> 25:03.585
Would you care to tell
her about them, Blake?

25:03.668 --> 25:05.170
I don't understa...
The senator is pretending

25:07.172 --> 25:09.966
we're in a game show.

25:10.050 --> 25:11.551
Let's you and me go have
some Blue Lid

25:11.635 --> 25:12.677
and quinoa cakes,
shall we?

25:12.761 --> 25:13.678
Yes. I'll alert you
at 12:45.

25:15.138 --> 25:17.098
Thank you.
Yes.

25:17.182 --> 25:19.226
In the beginning, my grandpa
used to strain the ale

25:19.309 --> 25:20.977
through an old pair
of blue jeans.

25:21.061 --> 25:22.646
That's where the color
and the name comes from.

25:22.729 --> 25:25.565
I'm guessing the FDA
wasn't around then.

25:25.649 --> 25:27.442
Mm, that's the truth.

25:27.525 --> 25:29.152
These days they add mulberries

25:29.236 --> 25:31.446
during the second
fermentation instead.

25:31.529 --> 25:33.114
The color's the same, but...

25:33.198 --> 25:36.326
the flavor's a lot
less earthy.

25:36.409 --> 25:39.746
Definitely sweet.
For good reason.

25:39.829 --> 25:41.331
The sweetness helps cover up
the high alcohol content.

25:41.414 --> 25:44.960
Would you believe
what you're drinking is

25:45.043 --> 25:47.963
15% alcohol by volume?

25:48.046 --> 25:49.297
Ma... Maybe I should have
another quinoa cake.

25:49.381 --> 25:51.925
(laughing)

25:52.008 --> 25:54.261
It can sneak up on you,
that's for sure.

25:54.344 --> 25:55.595
Maybe I should leave a bottle
for you and Dr. McCord

25:55.679 --> 25:59.474
to enjoy together.

25:59.557 --> 26:01.309
Or we can save it
to toast the passing

26:01.393 --> 26:04.145
of the Veterans'
Modernization Bill.

26:04.229 --> 26:07.107
Ah, I was wondering
when you'd get to that.

26:07.190 --> 26:08.775
Listen, I feel bad about
cancelling their appearance

26:08.858 --> 26:10.360
before the committee,

26:10.443 --> 26:13.154
but it's a complicated
situation.

26:13.238 --> 26:16.116
Not that complicated, really.

26:16.199 --> 26:18.326
The Department of Veterans
Affairs has modernized

26:18.410 --> 26:22.330
their appeals process
to everyone's benefit,

26:22.414 --> 26:24.708
and it's time for mental health
to get an overhaul.

26:24.791 --> 26:26.167
I've yet to decide
which way I'm gonna vote,

26:26.251 --> 26:29.546
so I would be more
than happy to hear

26:29.629 --> 26:31.631
your full-throated pitch,
Madam President.

26:31.715 --> 26:32.799
Oh, I appreciate that.

26:32.882 --> 26:35.510
Why don't we start...

26:35.593 --> 26:37.137
with the V.A.'s track record

26:37.220 --> 26:39.597
on processing claims

26:41.266 --> 26:42.976
and follow-up screenings?

26:44.436 --> 26:45.478
Hi, Daisy.

26:45.562 --> 26:47.355
Ma'am.
Yeah?

26:47.439 --> 26:50.191
Are you okay?
Yep.

26:50.275 --> 26:52.485
Uh, your lip is blue.
That's a problem.

26:52.569 --> 26:55.071
But I'm also drunk.
Mm-hmm.

26:55.155 --> 26:58.158
Are you headed back
to the Oval?

26:58.241 --> 26:59.367
I have a photo op with
the Flinging Dancing

26:59.451 --> 27:01.286
Scotsmen of...
Mm-hmm.

27:01.369 --> 27:03.038
Champions.
Mm-hmm.

27:03.121 --> 27:05.040
I think you should
come with me,

27:05.123 --> 27:06.583
and maybe tag the vice president
for the photo.
I think maybe.

27:06.666 --> 27:07.751
I like your thinking.
Let's go.

27:09.461 --> 27:10.879
I think so.

27:10.962 --> 27:13.006
Blake, focus on me.
Yeah.

27:13.089 --> 27:15.008
We're gonna need some aspirin,
vitamin C and a Gatorade.

27:15.091 --> 27:16.676
Okay. Ooh, not
the blue flavor.

27:16.760 --> 27:18.386
Good call. The president
needs to lie down

27:18.470 --> 27:20.013
for about 45 minutes,
uninterrupted.

27:20.096 --> 27:23.224
Okay.

27:23.308 --> 27:26.186
Blue Lip is 15% alcohol, Blake.

27:27.687 --> 27:29.230
Okay.

27:29.314 --> 27:30.065
I'm gonna go lie down.
Lie down.

27:30.148 --> 27:31.733
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

27:33.318 --> 27:34.903
Okay.
Okay.

27:34.986 --> 27:37.113
(horns honking)

27:40.867 --> 27:44.204
(indistinct chatter)

27:48.583 --> 27:49.626
(sound intensifies)

27:51.044 --> 27:51.836
(ringing)

27:51.920 --> 27:54.214
Hi, Evan.

27:54.297 --> 27:56.424
EVAN: Hey, Brad.
Tell Henry I'm sorry.

27:56.508 --> 27:58.093
I'm in a hell of a traffic jam.
Hard to tell how long.

27:58.176 --> 27:59.260
They should just start
without me.

27:59.344 --> 28:01.179
I'll-I'll get there
when I get there.

28:06.518 --> 28:09.729
Okay. Good luck.

28:10.855 --> 28:13.108
(horn honking)

28:13.191 --> 28:16.778
(tires screeching)

28:16.861 --> 28:17.946
Damn it! No!

28:18.029 --> 28:19.948
You okay, buddy?

28:20.031 --> 28:21.116
You hit me.
Sorry, I heard your horn.

28:21.199 --> 28:24.244
I guess I thought
you were moving.
And you hit me

28:24.327 --> 28:26.121
after honking
like a lunatic.
It wasn't my fault.

28:26.204 --> 28:27.288
It doesn't matter!
You rear-ended me.

28:27.372 --> 28:28.998
We need to exchange information
or I call the police.

28:30.250 --> 28:32.127
Get away from my car.

28:37.507 --> 28:40.093
Get away from my car!

28:51.271 --> 28:53.314
(indistinct chatter)

29:01.072 --> 29:03.074
(sirens approaching)

29:06.202 --> 29:07.120
(indistinct radio chatter)

29:07.203 --> 29:08.663
They're over there

29:08.746 --> 29:10.498
making up their story.

29:10.582 --> 29:11.958
(indistinct conversation)
I was the one
who got hit--

29:12.041 --> 29:14.544
I-I was just sitting there.

29:14.627 --> 29:16.171
He hit me!
Stay back, sir.

29:16.254 --> 29:18.173
Sir, can you come down
from there, please?
No!

29:18.256 --> 29:19.966
Not until you listen to me.

29:20.049 --> 29:21.968
It didn't happen the way
they're gonna say it did.

29:22.051 --> 29:24.345
I just want you to come down and
tell me your side of the story.

29:24.429 --> 29:26.306
Oh, what chance do I have,
two against one?

29:26.389 --> 29:27.515
Sir, nothing really bad
has happened here.

29:27.599 --> 29:30.351
It's just a fender bender.
Let's talk about it.

29:30.435 --> 29:33.354
No! No more talk.
It's all lies.

29:33.438 --> 29:35.356
I'm gonna end up
getting screwed.

29:35.440 --> 29:37.358
It always happens.
Don't you get it?

29:37.442 --> 29:39.527
Nobody listens
because nobody cares,

29:39.611 --> 29:42.697
and it's never gonna be
any different.

29:44.449 --> 29:47.285
Please, sir, come down now.

29:51.080 --> 29:52.332
(voice distorted):
Come down now.

29:52.415 --> 29:53.416
Gun! Gun!

29:58.421 --> 30:00.340
(gunshots)

30:00.423 --> 30:03.051
REPORTER: (on TV)
The shooting death
of Major Jenkins

30:03.134 --> 30:05.386
appears to be a case
of suicide by cop,

30:05.470 --> 30:07.055
as he was unarmed,
but deliberately reached

30:10.475 --> 30:12.894
behind his back.

30:12.977 --> 30:15.063
I thought his animation
was just...

30:15.146 --> 30:17.941
enthusiasm for the legislation.

30:18.024 --> 30:19.275
I should have known better,
a guy with his history.

30:19.359 --> 30:22.111
That's taking on
a lot, babe.

30:22.195 --> 30:25.240
I just got off the phone
with his wife.

30:25.323 --> 30:27.742
She said that he was
suffering from depression,

30:27.825 --> 30:29.911
probably due to his PTSD.

30:29.994 --> 30:31.871
But he stopped going
to see his therapist.

30:31.955 --> 30:34.624
Thought he had it beat.

30:34.707 --> 30:38.127
He said that helping other vets
was enough.

30:38.211 --> 30:41.965
Wow, the poor guy.

30:42.048 --> 30:44.300
People don't realize
what a beast PTSD is.

30:44.384 --> 30:46.219
You know, I was talking
to Ellen Hill,

30:46.302 --> 30:48.888
and she was saying that

30:48.972 --> 30:51.349
the suicide rate for veterans

30:51.432 --> 30:54.644
is twice what it is
for civilians.

30:54.727 --> 30:57.272
(sighs)

30:57.355 --> 31:00.441
Brad sent me a copy of
the speech he didn't get to give

31:00.525 --> 31:01.442
before the Veterans Affairs
Committee last night.

31:02.694 --> 31:05.280
It was attached to this...

31:05.363 --> 31:07.448
...long, rambling e-mail.

31:07.532 --> 31:09.284
That's another sign.

31:09.367 --> 31:10.285
I just put it down
to frustration.

31:10.368 --> 31:13.454
Wanting to get it
off his chest.

31:13.538 --> 31:15.498
Well, I think people get good

31:15.582 --> 31:18.293
at-at hiding PTSD.

31:18.376 --> 31:20.336
I worry about Stevie

31:20.420 --> 31:22.422
and what happened to her

31:22.505 --> 31:24.799
in the White House
bombing.

31:24.882 --> 31:26.426
Not everyone who experiences
a traumatic event

31:26.509 --> 31:27.844
suffers from PTSD.

31:27.927 --> 31:30.346
That's part of the problem.

31:30.430 --> 31:31.764
It's entirely
unpredictable.

31:31.848 --> 31:33.975
What about you?

31:34.058 --> 31:36.644
Not from the Gulf War.
I struggled for a while

31:36.728 --> 31:38.354
after I got shot, but...

31:38.438 --> 31:41.107
And, as you know,
the Fourth of July is

31:41.190 --> 31:43.359
no longer my favorite holiday.

31:43.443 --> 31:47.322
I could go a lifetime without
hearing any more fireworks.

31:48.865 --> 31:49.782
Well, I still struggle
with triggers.

31:49.866 --> 31:53.703
Sometimes...

31:54.704 --> 31:56.122
when you think
I'm listening to a podcast...

31:56.205 --> 31:58.458
Whale sounds.

31:58.541 --> 32:01.544
Why don't you tell me
when that's happening?

32:01.628 --> 32:04.172
Well, 'cause I don't want
to dwell on it, you know?

32:04.255 --> 32:06.549
I mean, that bombing in Iran
was a long time ago.

32:06.633 --> 32:08.176
I feel like I should
be over it.

32:08.259 --> 32:10.219
And then there's
this thing

32:13.431 --> 32:15.516
where...

32:15.600 --> 32:18.394
...if I'm talking about it,

32:18.478 --> 32:22.190
maybe I'm bringing it
into the house.

32:22.273 --> 32:25.693
Like... like I could
keep it at bay

32:27.737 --> 32:29.155
if I just don't
give it a name.

32:31.491 --> 32:34.702
I don't think
you're alone in that.

32:34.786 --> 32:37.538
That is why we have got
to educate people

32:37.622 --> 32:39.374
about this issue.

32:40.416 --> 32:42.669
Hey.

32:44.587 --> 32:45.922
You can always tell me anything.

32:47.799 --> 32:50.051
You too.

32:50.134 --> 32:51.177
RUSSELL:
Whip count in the Senate
puts the numbers

32:51.260 --> 32:53.763
uncomfortably close.

32:53.846 --> 32:55.390
We'd be lucky to clear a
filibuster by a single vote.

32:55.473 --> 32:57.558
Which is why,
crass as it is,

32:57.642 --> 33:00.520
we need to use the death
of the Medal of Honor winner.

33:00.603 --> 33:03.398
Recipient, not winner.
It's not a contest.

33:03.481 --> 33:05.566
My mistake. But this guy died
because he was frustrated

33:05.650 --> 33:07.860
by a system that let him down,
as well as the other vets

33:07.944 --> 33:09.570
he spent his life
trying to help. This bill

33:09.654 --> 33:11.197
could assure that
his life's work

33:11.280 --> 33:13.741
had value, had meaning.

33:13.825 --> 33:15.410
Still, his family...

33:15.493 --> 33:16.911
The man was obviously
in pain.

33:16.994 --> 33:18.871
He's got a widow
and two young children.

33:18.955 --> 33:20.581
How will they feel
seeing more of this

33:20.665 --> 33:22.417
in the coming news cycles?
Isn't that exactly why

33:22.500 --> 33:24.877
this legislation
needs to be passed?

33:24.961 --> 33:26.796
I mean, with modernization,
there's a better chance

33:26.879 --> 33:29.424
that guys like Major Jenkins
won't be left out in the cold.

33:29.507 --> 33:31.926
I... I think
he would have wanted that.

33:32.009 --> 33:33.928
I have to say I agree
with Mike on this.

33:35.012 --> 33:37.265
Did not see that coming.

33:37.348 --> 33:38.933
Daisy, what do you think?
It's delicate,

33:39.016 --> 33:40.560
but I-I think
there's an approach

33:40.643 --> 33:42.770
that could work
for everyone.

33:42.854 --> 33:45.106
Then go ahead,
prepare a press release.

33:45.189 --> 33:46.733
I'll take a look at it
and make my decision then.

33:53.406 --> 33:54.782
Thanks, everyone.
Yes, ma'am.

33:54.866 --> 33:56.617
What haven't you told us?

33:56.701 --> 33:58.327
What?
I'm hearing that Hanson

33:58.411 --> 33:59.620
is gonna demand
that you go back

33:59.704 --> 34:00.621
in front of the
Intelligence Committee

34:00.705 --> 34:02.498
'cause they think you lied.

34:02.582 --> 34:03.499
This is very serious.

34:03.583 --> 34:05.251
Do you have any idea
what it's about?

34:06.669 --> 34:08.254
No.

34:10.047 --> 34:12.507
I didn't lie to the committee.

34:12.592 --> 34:13.384
Listen... just be careful.

34:13.467 --> 34:15.762
And smart.

34:15.844 --> 34:17.429
There's a chance
this is just something

34:17.513 --> 34:18.431
where you have to
correct the record.

34:18.514 --> 34:19.974
If so,

34:20.056 --> 34:21.434
do it.

34:25.563 --> 34:27.565
And fast.

34:32.570 --> 34:33.279
(door closes)

34:33.362 --> 34:36.491
HANSON:
Ms. Grant, you are still
under oath.

34:36.574 --> 34:38.159
Yes. Uh, and,
Senator Hanson,

34:38.242 --> 34:40.536
just let me say
that I am happy

34:40.620 --> 34:42.621
to set the record straight
by clarifying any issues.

34:42.705 --> 34:45.500
There is this one item.

34:45.583 --> 34:46.918
The list you provided--
the, uh, the eyewitnesses

34:47.001 --> 34:49.085
to the incident in the bar--
is this

34:51.589 --> 34:54.675
a complete list?
I believe so.

34:54.759 --> 34:57.011
Take a look at this, please.

34:57.094 --> 34:58.346
MAN: (in video)
I'm cool with that,
if I can watch.

34:58.429 --> 34:59.680
Okay. Uh...
Oh, my God.

34:59.764 --> 35:02.141
Excuse me.
No, no, no, no, come on,

35:02.225 --> 35:04.685
hey, I mean,
you're both really hot.

35:04.769 --> 35:05.937
Come on, stop being
bitches about it.

35:06.020 --> 35:08.523
Hey...
(exclaims)

35:08.606 --> 35:10.900
Oh!

35:18.449 --> 35:21.410
(alarmed chatter)

35:21.494 --> 35:23.579
Oh, uh, I'm sorry.
That's Claudine Bernard.

35:23.663 --> 35:26.541
She's a friend who works
at the French embassy.

35:26.624 --> 35:30.545
I forgot she we there
that night.
You simply forgot about

35:30.628 --> 35:31.712
your best eyewitness
to the assault?

35:31.796 --> 35:34.882
And the fact that
she should have been included

35:34.966 --> 35:37.176
on the list of foreign nationals
with whom you had contact.

35:37.260 --> 35:39.428
It was a, uh, chaotic night,

35:39.512 --> 35:42.306
coupled with the exhaustion
from the campaign.

35:42.390 --> 35:44.725
Plus, I admit I had
more than one drink.

35:44.809 --> 35:47.728
OLIVIA:
Senator, Ms. Grant has
been very forthcoming,

35:47.812 --> 35:49.689
and this lapse is one
that can be easily remedied

35:49.772 --> 35:53.359
by amending our
foreign nationals list

35:53.442 --> 35:56.112
to include Claudine Bernard.
I'd like to add that

35:56.195 --> 35:58.739
this omission
is hardly egregious,

35:58.823 --> 36:00.366
considering that France
is an extremely

36:01.826 --> 36:03.244
close ally.

36:03.327 --> 36:05.121
Very well.

36:05.204 --> 36:07.748
Please see to that.

36:10.334 --> 36:11.711
And thank you
for your cooperation.

36:21.178 --> 36:22.096
It's okay.

36:22.179 --> 36:25.141
Hey, so, quick question.

36:25.224 --> 36:26.309
I, uh, I bought a lot
of different kinds of

36:26.392 --> 36:29.228
tick repellent for this trip.

36:29.312 --> 36:31.772
You know, sprays
as well as a balm.

36:31.856 --> 36:33.274
But, uh, since your
secret service detail

36:33.357 --> 36:34.775
are right there behind us,

36:34.859 --> 36:37.737
and they are technically
here to protect you,

36:39.739 --> 36:43.242
are they responsible
for warding off ticks?

36:43.326 --> 36:44.285
Um, you know, I think
I'm-I'm on my own on that one.

36:44.368 --> 36:46.746
Oh, yeah, I guess.
Uh, yeah,

36:46.829 --> 36:48.289
I just can't
really see them, like,

36:48.372 --> 36:51.125
spraying me down

36:51.208 --> 36:52.627
or, um, giving me a skin check.

36:52.710 --> 36:55.338
Yeah, good point.
Well, that's okay.

36:55.421 --> 36:57.590
We're good, we're good,
because I also brought

36:57.673 --> 36:59.592
something called a tick key,

36:59.675 --> 37:02.136
and something called
a tick nipper.

37:03.471 --> 37:05.681
So I think I got us
pretty well covered.
Mm.

37:10.394 --> 37:12.480
(both laugh)

37:12.563 --> 37:13.689
PEOPLES:
Good afternoon.

37:13.773 --> 37:16.984
(cameras clicking)

37:17.068 --> 37:19.695
Before the Veterans' Affairs
Mental Health Modernization Bill

37:19.779 --> 37:21.572
is marked up and voted on,
the committee would like

37:22.573 --> 37:24.951
to hear testimony
from Dr. Henry McCord.

37:25.034 --> 37:28.371
Thank you, Chairman Peoples.

37:28.454 --> 37:31.415
The night before he died,
Major Brad Jenkins

37:31.499 --> 37:34.001
sent me the speech he didn't
get to make before you.

37:34.085 --> 37:36.045
I've decided that his are
the most important words

37:37.755 --> 37:40.633
you should hear today.

37:40.716 --> 37:42.843
"I didn't come here
to denigrate the V.A.,

37:42.927 --> 37:47.348
"which does such important work,

37:47.431 --> 37:50.685
"but I think we have to admit
it has become inefficient.

37:50.768 --> 37:53.980
"How could it not when 7.1
million service people have been

37:54.063 --> 37:55.189
"added to the roster from
the Gulf War to the present?

37:55.272 --> 37:57.858
"And here's what happens:

37:57.942 --> 37:59.860
"Active duty is over,
and you transfer

37:59.944 --> 38:02.697
"from D.O.D.
to civilian V.A. care.

38:02.780 --> 38:05.533
"They tell you you'll have
yearly physical exams

38:05.616 --> 38:07.743
"that you must maintain
to stay active in the system.

38:07.827 --> 38:10.496
"And part of that exam

38:10.579 --> 38:14.166
"is a depression
and PTSD screening.

38:14.250 --> 38:17.545
"But service members
who worry about having PTSD

38:17.628 --> 38:20.965
"on their record don't show up
for those appointments,

38:21.048 --> 38:23.551
"or don't tell the truth.

38:23.634 --> 38:24.885
"Guys like a retired captain
I met who was in Afghanistan

38:24.969 --> 38:25.928
for his fourth deployment..."

38:26.012 --> 38:28.681
Ready.

38:28.764 --> 38:30.891
"...and found
a seven-year-old boy hiding.

38:30.975 --> 38:32.226
"The boy was holding
his baby sister,

38:32.309 --> 38:35.438
"who'd had her legs blown off.
(rifles fire)

38:35.521 --> 38:36.897
"The kid said,
'Please, don't tell my father.'

38:36.981 --> 38:38.232
(rifles fire,
bugle playing taps)

38:38.315 --> 38:39.734
Or a private I talked to..."

38:39.817 --> 38:42.111
Fire.
(rifles fire)

38:42.194 --> 38:44.572
"...whose best buddy
stepped outside for a smoke.

38:44.655 --> 38:47.908
"A mortar hit close by,
and after the smoke cleared,

38:47.992 --> 38:49.910
"the private ran out
to find his friend,

38:49.994 --> 38:51.912
"but all he found was one boot,

38:51.996 --> 38:53.164
"his friend's foot
still in it.

38:53.247 --> 38:55.416
(bugle continues playing taps)

38:55.499 --> 38:57.793
"These aren't unusual stories.

38:59.336 --> 39:02.381
"Most veterans have some
that they never share.

39:02.465 --> 39:04.050
"The V.A. tries, but it's big

39:04.133 --> 39:05.092
and needs all the help
we can give it."

39:05.176 --> 39:06.761
Thank you.

39:06.844 --> 39:08.929
"People fall through the cracks

39:09.013 --> 39:11.932
"because of
bureaucratic failures,

39:12.016 --> 39:13.934
"and it's hard for warriors
to admit weakness.

39:14.018 --> 39:16.937
(thunder rumbling softly)

39:17.021 --> 39:20.274
"This modernization bill
will address that.

39:20.357 --> 39:22.485
"It won't solve everything,
but it will help.

39:22.568 --> 39:24.904
"I think we have to try
to improve the lives

39:24.987 --> 39:27.198
"of our most altruistic
citizens.

39:30.618 --> 39:33.496
I have faith
you'll get it done."

39:33.579 --> 39:36.624
I shared this speech
with Major Jenkins' wife Andrea,

39:36.707 --> 39:38.125
and she told me that
all the horrible stories

39:40.211 --> 39:41.754
that he described...

39:43.756 --> 39:45.299
...they happened to him.

39:45.382 --> 39:48.302
And not just
the battle stories,

39:48.385 --> 39:50.638
but the fact that
administrators at the V.A.

39:50.721 --> 39:53.849
missed or didn't act
when Major Jenkins

39:53.933 --> 39:55.643
fell behind on
his PTSD treatments.

39:55.726 --> 39:58.521
He was a war hero,

39:58.604 --> 40:00.981
a Medal of Honor recipient,

40:01.065 --> 40:02.775
and even he fell
through the cracks.

40:02.858 --> 40:04.860
I think Major Jenkins
said it best,

40:04.944 --> 40:07.488
so I'll simply
echo his words.

40:07.571 --> 40:09.949
Let's do better...

40:21.252 --> 40:23.712
for the people
who give most to our country.

40:29.760 --> 40:32.012
♪ ♪

40:32.096 --> 40:34.515
The children next to her

40:34.598 --> 40:36.392
when she was accepting the
flag was heartbreaking.

40:36.475 --> 40:38.018
It is. (sniffs)

40:38.102 --> 40:40.020
He survived the war,

40:40.104 --> 40:42.022
and I'm sure they
thought he was safe...

40:42.106 --> 40:43.107
Whatever you're doing
to yourself

40:43.190 --> 40:46.986
right now, Carlos, you can't.

40:47.069 --> 40:48.529
I should have let him
address that damn committee.

40:48.612 --> 40:50.406
No, it might not have mattered.

40:50.489 --> 40:52.700
Might have been
something down the line.

40:52.783 --> 40:56.078
(grunts softly)

40:56.162 --> 40:58.914
Least the bill passed.
Maybe it'll help.

40:58.998 --> 41:01.876
You know, my objections
were purely on policy.

41:01.959 --> 41:05.045
I do.

41:05.129 --> 41:07.047
It's our first big clash.
You having any second thoughts?

41:08.757 --> 41:10.050
No. Are you?

41:10.134 --> 41:13.345
Some.

41:15.139 --> 41:17.600
What we're doing
has never been done before.

41:17.683 --> 41:19.059
First one through the wall
always gets bloody.

41:19.143 --> 41:22.897
I don't mind that part.

41:22.980 --> 41:27.735
I just don't want to be
bloody and ineffective.

41:27.818 --> 41:32.907
This relationship is effective
because of what it stands for.

41:32.990 --> 41:36.035
Two people who disagree
still make progress, together.

41:36.118 --> 41:38.037
Yeah, but, uh, I think
your husband hates me right now.

41:38.120 --> 41:39.747
Well, buy him
a jalapeño cheeseburger.

41:39.830 --> 41:41.790
He's the forgiving type.

41:41.874 --> 41:44.126
(chuckles):
Yeah?

41:44.210 --> 41:45.794
How do you think
I've lasted this long?

41:45.878 --> 41:47.838
(laughs)

41:49.173 --> 41:51.008
Come on.
Okay.

42:00.976 --> 42:02.228
(thunder rumbling)

42:05.189 --> 42:06.941
(groans softly)

42:07.024 --> 42:09.026
Hanson turn nasty?

42:10.402 --> 42:12.613
He is a horse's ass.

42:12.696 --> 42:13.948
What? You forgot a name.

42:14.031 --> 42:16.784
It's not the end
of the world.

42:16.867 --> 42:19.870
No. No, it's bigger
than that.

42:24.208 --> 42:26.460
I left Claudine's name
off the list for a reason.

42:26.543 --> 42:28.212
We should go inside.

42:31.215 --> 42:32.883
(thunder rumbling softly)

42:32.967 --> 42:33.968
(thunder rumbling)
