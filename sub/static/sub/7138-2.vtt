01:46.433 --> 01:49.333
- Ask any tow-headed schoolboy
how many senses we got,

01:49.400 --> 01:52.300
and it's likely
they're gonna say five.

01:52.367 --> 01:53.333
Five?

01:53.400 --> 01:54.934
Are you kiddin' me?

01:55.000 --> 01:57.767
What about my sense of balance,
entitlement, fair play?

01:57.834 --> 01:59.400
Problem is,

01:59.467 --> 02:02.367
five is about the most our
tiny little brains can handle.

02:02.433 --> 02:05.300
But sometimes we have
so many senses cluttering us up,

02:05.367 --> 02:07.266
so many ways to feel
about a thing,

02:07.333 --> 02:09.867
we blow a fuse.

02:09.934 --> 02:11.300
And what's that lead to?

02:11.367 --> 02:13.133
Senseless violence.

02:13.200 --> 02:16.700
Yeah, senseless violence,

02:16.767 --> 02:19.033
comes in all shapes
and colors.

02:19.100 --> 02:21.066
- For a second day,

02:21.133 --> 02:23.400
riots have rocked
the east side of the city,

02:23.467 --> 02:26.300
ignited by Governor Devlin's
comment that he would pardon

02:26.367 --> 02:29.133
Mayor Wilson Loewen
if Loewen is convicted

02:29.200 --> 02:31.200
for his role
in the 1963 murder

02:31.266 --> 02:34.133
of two small
African-American girls.

02:34.200 --> 02:36.100
In response
to the rioting,

02:36.166 --> 02:37.867
city schools
and offices are closed.

02:37.934 --> 02:39.633
All state correctional
facilities

02:39.700 --> 02:41.166
are under tight security.

02:41.233 --> 02:44.266
A verdict is expected
sometime this week.

02:46.367 --> 02:48.333
- Guard, guard!

02:48.400 --> 02:50.300
Aah!

02:50.367 --> 02:52.533
No!

02:52.600 --> 02:54.066
- Your father was stabbed
with an ice pick,

02:54.133 --> 02:57.367
once in the back,
several times in the stomach.

03:00.500 --> 03:01.834
- Who?

03:01.900 --> 03:03.400
Who murdered my dad?

03:03.467 --> 03:05.900
- We're investigating,
searching cells for evidence,

03:05.967 --> 03:07.633
for the murder weapon.

03:09.333 --> 03:11.033
- Man, this is bullshit.

03:15.800 --> 03:18.600
- I--I want to go
to the funeral.

03:18.667 --> 03:20.800
- I'm sorry,
we can't permit that.

03:20.867 --> 03:22.266
We're in lockdown.

03:22.333 --> 03:25.333
- But warden, my parole hearing
is tomorrow,

03:25.400 --> 03:27.467
and there's
a fairly good chance

03:27.533 --> 03:29.333
that I'm gonna
go free anyway.

03:29.400 --> 03:33.300
- Because of the riots,
your hearing has been postponed.

03:34.300 --> 03:37.700
- Guess what we found.

03:38.867 --> 03:40.066
- But why?

03:40.133 --> 03:42.233
Why would Clarence Seroy
kill my father?

03:42.300 --> 03:43.900
I don't know Seroy;
it makes no sense.

03:43.967 --> 03:47.066
- This is Oz, Beecher,
and nothing makes sense.

03:47.133 --> 03:48.934
Maybe it's these riots.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.867
There's a lot of
racial tension out there.

03:50.934 --> 03:55.734
- No, more likely,
the Aryans hired Seroy,

03:55.800 --> 03:59.266
or planted the ice pick
in his cell to throw Glynn off.

03:59.333 --> 04:03.834
This is fucking
Schillinger's doing.

04:03.900 --> 04:06.066
- Killing Beecher's father,
man, what a rush.

04:06.133 --> 04:09.200
It's better than
a case of Red Bull.

04:09.266 --> 04:12.166
The fuckin' hacks haven't
a clue who did the deed.

04:13.266 --> 04:15.600
Hey, Clarence,
how's it going?

04:15.667 --> 04:16.734
- Man, this is bullshit.

04:18.867 --> 04:20.667
- They'll never
figure out who did it.

04:20.734 --> 04:22.300
- Shut the fuck up!

04:22.367 --> 04:24.300
- The jury found Mayor
Wilson Loewen guilty

04:24.367 --> 04:26.767
of murder in
the second degree.

04:27.867 --> 04:28.900
- Fuck!

04:33.000 --> 04:34.667
- I believe that
Mayor Loewen is innocent

04:34.734 --> 04:38.767
and I believe that this trial
was a mockery of justice.

04:38.834 --> 04:43.633
However, due to the volatility
of the situation,

04:43.700 --> 04:45.934
I will not pardon him.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.767
I won't
pardon him yet.

04:47.834 --> 04:51.000
We'll let the smoke clear,
wait a few months,

04:51.066 --> 04:53.200
then we'll get him out.

04:53.266 --> 04:54.734
- Why send him here?

04:54.800 --> 04:57.467
Put Loewen in a nice,
cushy minimum security prison

04:57.533 --> 04:59.934
like Hecht or Macarthur.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.800
- That won't
placate the mob.

05:01.867 --> 05:03.200
They want the mayor
to suffer.

05:03.266 --> 05:05.300
- The most important thing
is to keep him safe.

05:05.367 --> 05:08.900
What's the safest place
in this charnel house?

05:08.967 --> 05:10.834
- Unit J.

05:10.900 --> 05:13.667
Primarily we put bad cops there
so they don't face retaliation

05:13.734 --> 05:15.700
by the rest
of the community.

05:15.767 --> 05:17.200
- Who's in that
cell block now?

05:17.266 --> 05:19.867
- Alvin Yood,
Tobias Beecher.

05:19.934 --> 05:21.800
- Are either
of them black?

05:23.066 --> 05:25.266
- No.

05:25.333 --> 05:27.066
- Okay.

05:27.133 --> 05:29.233
Well, hear this.

05:29.300 --> 05:32.667
Wilson Loewen
is my friend.

05:32.734 --> 05:38.033
Anything happens
to him, Leo, anything,

05:38.100 --> 05:40.934
I will burn this building
to the ground.

05:50.767 --> 05:52.900
- Mayor Loewen.

05:52.967 --> 05:54.233
- Hello, Leo.

05:54.300 --> 05:57.633
The last time I saw you
was at the big fund-raiser

05:57.700 --> 05:59.266
in Morrisville
back when you were

05:59.333 --> 06:00.600
running for
lieutenant governor.

06:00.667 --> 06:04.867
We brought in a shitload
of cash that night, huh?

06:04.934 --> 06:07.066
I was disappointed when
you dropped out of the race.

06:07.133 --> 06:09.233
I always thought you had the
makings of a fine politician.

06:09.300 --> 06:13.333
- Look, whatever relationship
we may have had in the past,

06:13.400 --> 06:15.100
that's over.

06:15.166 --> 06:17.734
You're my prisoner now.

06:18.734 --> 06:20.734
- That simple, huh?

06:20.800 --> 06:23.200
Or do you think I actually
killed those little girls?

06:23.266 --> 06:24.533
- You were found guilty.

06:24.600 --> 06:27.266
- Well, as a black man,

06:27.333 --> 06:29.900
you ought to know
that don't mean dick.

06:29.967 --> 06:32.433
- Take his honor
to Unit J.

06:32.500 --> 06:34.533
- Thank you, friend.

06:40.834 --> 06:42.467
male reporter: The streets are
once again calm,

06:42.533 --> 06:44.567
though the damage
to the east side

06:44.633 --> 06:46.934
due to the rioting is
estimated at $13.7 million.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.900
- Lockdown is over!

06:48.967 --> 06:50.367
- About fuckin' time.

06:50.433 --> 06:52.500
Phelan, where'd they
put Wilson Loewen?

06:52.567 --> 06:54.266
- Don't know.

06:54.333 --> 06:55.800
Probably Unit J.

06:55.867 --> 06:57.600
- J?
Shit.

06:57.667 --> 06:59.100
- Let me
the fuck out!

06:59.166 --> 07:00.867
- Shut up, Cutler,
I'm coming.

07:00.934 --> 07:02.633
- Beecher's in J.

07:02.700 --> 07:05.500
He'll try to hurt the mayor
to get back at me.

07:05.567 --> 07:08.767
I want you to put
the word out, Winthrop.

07:08.834 --> 07:10.233
I want Beecher to know

07:10.300 --> 07:13.066
he better not touch a hair
on the old man's head.

07:16.233 --> 07:18.700
- We were in the oval office
and the president says to me,

07:18.767 --> 07:20.900
"Wilson,
if it weren't for you,

07:20.967 --> 07:22.433
I wouldn't be sitting
in this chair."

07:22.500 --> 07:24.900
And he gave me
these cuff links, see.

07:24.967 --> 07:26.867
Got the presidential
shield on them.

07:26.934 --> 07:29.000
- Mr. Mayor, you're
the only one I know

07:29.066 --> 07:30.934
with a bigger
appetite than me.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.266
- Appetite...

07:32.333 --> 07:33.834
Yeah, for power.

07:33.900 --> 07:36.400
I hear you're not gonna
resign from office.

07:36.467 --> 07:38.100
You're forcing the city council
to vote you out?

07:38.166 --> 07:41.200
- Well, the Honorable
James Michael Curley

07:41.266 --> 07:43.867
served the good people of Boston
while he was incarcerated.

07:43.934 --> 07:47.133
Hell, he even won re-election
while sitting in stir.

07:47.200 --> 07:48.700
I could do
the same thing.

07:48.767 --> 07:50.266
The people love me.
I might run for governor.

07:50.333 --> 07:52.333
- Hell, why not
run for God?

07:58.033 --> 08:01.133
- Hmm...

08:01.700 --> 08:02.934
- What the hell?

08:11.734 --> 08:13.600
- Oh, Jesus.

08:16.734 --> 08:18.367
- How are you doin'?
Can you talk?

08:18.433 --> 08:20.333
- Oh, yeah,
I'm all right, I just...

08:20.400 --> 08:22.934
Choked on...

08:23.000 --> 08:25.600
- He gave him
the Heimlich Maneuver.

08:26.367 --> 08:27.800
- He what?

08:27.867 --> 08:30.333
- Beecher saved
Loewen's life.

08:35.233 --> 08:36.633
- What does Schillinger
want with me?

08:36.700 --> 08:39.100
- I think it's better
if he tells you himself.

08:39.166 --> 08:42.533
- I don't want to hear
anymore of his lies.

08:42.600 --> 08:44.266
You know, this is probably
just some trap

08:44.333 --> 08:45.734
to fuck with
my parole hearing tomorrow.

08:45.800 --> 08:48.000
- I'll admit Schillinger
has conned me in the past,

08:48.066 --> 08:49.600
same as you,
but I--

08:49.667 --> 08:52.000
this time
it's different.

08:56.166 --> 08:58.400
- Beecher.

08:58.467 --> 09:00.333
- What do you want?

09:02.934 --> 09:06.667
- Wilson Loewen has always
been there for my family,

09:06.734 --> 09:07.867
for me.

09:09.333 --> 09:11.100
When my pop
couldn't find work,

09:11.166 --> 09:12.867
he gave him a job
in the parks department.

09:12.934 --> 09:16.033
When Martha and I couldn't
afford a honeymoon,

09:16.100 --> 09:18.700
he gave us airline tickets.

09:18.767 --> 09:20.266
The man is my hero.

09:20.333 --> 09:21.934
You saved his life.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.934
I am now indebted to you.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.533
So, I want you to know

09:27.600 --> 09:30.900
that I won't do anything
to try and stop your parole.

09:30.967 --> 09:34.500
If you can get out
of this fuck hole...

09:34.567 --> 09:36.633
Go.

09:40.900 --> 09:43.367
- Bullshit.

09:43.433 --> 09:45.467
Whatever you're selling,
Vern, I'm not buying.

09:45.533 --> 09:47.367
You grateful to me?

09:47.433 --> 09:49.333
- It's true.

09:49.400 --> 09:50.734
- True?

09:50.800 --> 09:54.867
I can give you a list
as big as my tattooed ass

09:54.934 --> 09:56.467
of things you said were true.

09:56.533 --> 09:58.467
Do I have to stay here?

09:58.533 --> 10:00.066
- No.

10:00.133 --> 10:02.667
- Beecher, if my backing off
wasn't what you were after,

10:02.734 --> 10:04.500
why'd you save Loewen?

10:06.166 --> 10:09.300
- Because I saw
a man dying,

10:09.367 --> 10:12.800
and my instinct was
to save his life,

10:12.867 --> 10:15.066
my gut instinct.

10:15.133 --> 10:19.166
After all these years in Oz,
I still have that instinct.

10:19.233 --> 10:22.066
That's something you
don't know shit about.

10:23.967 --> 10:27.433
- Due to recent circumstances,
the death of your father,

10:27.500 --> 10:29.834
your saving
a fellow inmate's life,

10:29.900 --> 10:32.567
as well as your continued
outstanding behavior,

10:32.633 --> 10:37.133
the board has decided
to grant you parole.

10:38.500 --> 10:40.166
You're a free man,
Mr. Beecher.

10:40.233 --> 10:42.433
The processing
takes a few days,

10:42.500 --> 10:46.400
but for all intents
and purposes, you are free.

10:51.533 --> 10:53.667
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

11:05.367 --> 11:07.500
- Pinch me, sister,
I'm dreaming again.

11:07.567 --> 11:12.900
- No, Tobias,
you are not dreaming.

11:14.166 --> 11:16.100
Oh, oh, oh,
my goodness.

11:16.166 --> 11:17.567
- Holy fuckin' Christ!

11:17.633 --> 11:19.233
- Oh, my God!

11:20.700 --> 11:22.567
- Oh, my God.

11:25.934 --> 11:29.000
- Yo, Lopresti, my lawyer was
supposed to be here an hour ago.

11:29.066 --> 11:30.633
Can you call down
and find out what's going on?

11:30.700 --> 11:32.033
- You haven't heard?

11:32.100 --> 11:34.233
- Heard what?

11:34.300 --> 11:36.467
- I got good news
and I got bad news.

11:36.533 --> 11:40.367
The bad news is
Beecher's father's dead.

11:40.433 --> 11:43.066
- No.

11:43.133 --> 11:47.433
- The day we went into lockdown,
murdered right down the hall.

11:47.500 --> 11:49.900
I guess that puts
a kink in your appeal.

11:54.200 --> 11:55.967
- What's the good news?

11:56.033 --> 11:58.767
- Your girlfriend
got paroled.

11:58.834 --> 12:01.967
That's right,
Beecher's going home,

12:02.033 --> 12:05.900
and from what I hear,
he's in such a hurry to leave,

12:05.967 --> 12:10.233
he won't even have time
to come say bye-bye.

12:21.300 --> 12:22.900
- You know
what they say?

12:22.967 --> 12:24.867
When one of
your senses fails,

12:24.934 --> 12:27.066
the other ones compensate
by getting stronger.

12:27.133 --> 12:28.734
Like if you go blind,

12:28.800 --> 12:30.900
your hearing
suddenly perks up.

12:30.967 --> 12:32.834
Can't smell?

12:32.900 --> 12:34.400
Your taste buds bloom.

12:34.467 --> 12:37.133
So what happens
if you lost them all,

12:37.200 --> 12:40.734
if things no longer
make any sense?

12:40.800 --> 12:44.166
You've got to rely on others
to get you through the day,

12:44.233 --> 12:49.500
and in Oz,
that could be dangerous.

12:49.567 --> 12:52.400
- Rise and shine,
you little fucks!

12:52.467 --> 12:54.500
Get up!

12:54.567 --> 12:56.000
- I can't, I'm sick.

12:56.066 --> 12:57.400
- Bullshit.

12:57.467 --> 13:00.266
If you think you're taking
a siesta in the hospital

13:00.333 --> 13:02.934
just because White did,
you're in for a rude awakening.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.967
Now, get the fuck up.

13:11.066 --> 13:13.333
Oh, Jesus.

13:13.400 --> 13:15.500
- Claire, we got
a problem over here.

13:15.567 --> 13:20.100
- What the fuck
is this, Ebola?

13:22.033 --> 13:23.967
- Fuck you, Martinez.

13:24.033 --> 13:25.734
- Un di voy
a meterlo en su culo.

13:25.800 --> 13:28.166
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
cha, cha, cha yourself.

13:28.233 --> 13:29.834
- Fuck you, all right?

13:29.900 --> 13:31.533
- You better calm down,
Mr. Martinez,

13:31.600 --> 13:33.400
or I will put you
in restraints.

13:33.467 --> 13:35.834
- What is he,
the nurse's pet?

13:36.967 --> 13:39.800
- Glynn, Nathan won't
give me more painkillers.

13:39.867 --> 13:42.266
- So, call the A.M.A.

13:47.433 --> 13:49.166
What's the emergency?

13:49.233 --> 13:51.000
- Penders, White and Martinez

13:51.066 --> 13:52.533
have methylene chloride
poisoning.

13:52.600 --> 13:54.433
- Did someone
poison them?

13:54.500 --> 13:56.800
- Not someone, us.
- What?

13:56.867 --> 13:58.834
- Oz itself.

13:58.900 --> 14:01.567
Methylene chloride's
found in aerosols,

14:01.633 --> 14:05.333
paint removers, metal cleaning
products, polyurethane,

14:05.400 --> 14:08.000
basically everything that
was used to rebuild this place.

14:08.066 --> 14:10.233
And guess where all
the residue settled?

14:10.300 --> 14:11.934
- In solitary.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.367
Shit.

14:13.433 --> 14:15.967
So, what's the prognosis?

14:16.033 --> 14:17.934
- Well, when caught early,
treatable respiratory

14:18.000 --> 14:22.000
and gastric problems,
but these guys, Leo,

14:22.066 --> 14:24.400
it's all they've been
breathing in 24 hours a day.

14:24.467 --> 14:26.700
Martinez's
liver is shot.

14:26.767 --> 14:29.266
Penders and White
have lung damage,

14:29.333 --> 14:32.333
and to say nothing of
the neurophysiological effects.

14:32.400 --> 14:34.367
- These guys are
gonna get crazy?

14:34.433 --> 14:36.133
- Or it may
make them sane.

14:36.200 --> 14:39.166
But Martinez needs treatment
I can't provide.

14:39.233 --> 14:41.166
I'd like to send him
to Benchley Memorial.

14:46.934 --> 14:49.367
No.

14:49.433 --> 14:50.967
- Well, he'll get
better care.

14:51.033 --> 14:54.100
- For the moment,
let's keep this close to home.

14:54.166 --> 14:55.700
- Leo...

14:55.767 --> 14:57.600
- I don't think we need
to spread the word just yet

14:57.667 --> 14:59.266
that Oz is toxic.

14:59.333 --> 15:01.266
- Well, then I want
to go on record.

15:01.333 --> 15:03.233
- You're a good doctor,
Gloria.

15:03.300 --> 15:05.033
You saved Pancamo after
he caught a staph infection.

15:05.100 --> 15:06.734
We didn't go public
with that, did we?

15:06.800 --> 15:09.867
I have faith

15:09.934 --> 15:11.767
that you'll pull
these guys through, too.

15:24.433 --> 15:25.834
- Espire.

15:25.900 --> 15:30.467
Espire.

15:30.533 --> 15:31.967
- Me siento
como una mierda.

15:32.033 --> 15:34.734
- Yo se, yo se.

15:35.867 --> 15:37.433
Don't you knock?

15:37.500 --> 15:39.100
- Sorry.

15:39.166 --> 15:41.367
Didn't think you'd be doing
anything that needed knocking.

15:41.433 --> 15:44.133
I'm here to transfer
Martinez back to solitary.

15:44.200 --> 15:45.934
- He's not going back
to solitary yet.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.066
- That's what
the paperwork says.

15:47.133 --> 15:48.433
- I don't care about
the paperwork.

15:48.500 --> 15:50.100
- Unless you get Glynn
to tell me different,

15:50.166 --> 15:51.633
Martinez is going.

15:51.700 --> 15:53.500
- I'll be right back.

15:54.900 --> 15:56.600
Excuse me.

16:03.834 --> 16:08.400
- So, what ails you,
Martinez, huh?

16:08.467 --> 16:11.133
You gonna die?

16:12.700 --> 16:15.500
Oh, I love it when
you go all silent on me.

16:15.567 --> 16:17.800
But I don't want
you to die,

16:17.867 --> 16:22.867
at least not until you tell me
who paid you to cut my tendon.

16:23.600 --> 16:25.800
And you will
tell me, Carlos,

16:25.867 --> 16:27.700
'cause I have friends
in solitary.

16:27.767 --> 16:29.467
And when you get back there
they're gonna--

16:29.533 --> 16:32.300
- I have the warden on the phone
in my office, line three.

16:33.433 --> 16:35.900
- Buenas noches,
mi amigo.

16:39.000 --> 16:45.133
Hey, you two make
a really cute pair.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
- Jackhammer
miss sally style.

16:52.066 --> 16:54.033
And five, and five,

16:54.100 --> 16:57.300
and three, and do-si-do,
and back and forth,

16:57.367 --> 16:59.567
and five, and five,
and two, and three...

16:59.633 --> 17:01.166
- This is the best
"Miss Sally" ever.

17:01.233 --> 17:02.967
- And jump it out
and work those legs...

17:03.033 --> 17:05.433
- Officer Murphy,
I got an ask.

17:05.500 --> 17:07.500
- I'm in no mood
to be tender, Morales.

17:07.567 --> 17:08.900
- I want to shift jobs.

17:08.967 --> 17:11.033
I've been working at mechanicals
since I got to Oz.

17:11.100 --> 17:12.100
I need a change.

17:12.166 --> 17:13.300
- To where?

17:13.367 --> 17:15.100
- I'm thinking hospital.

17:15.166 --> 17:16.867
I got a couple of pals
who are orderlies,

17:16.934 --> 17:18.033
I thought maybe
I could do some good.

17:18.100 --> 17:20.133
- Some good for yourself,
you mean.

17:20.200 --> 17:21.934
What do you think,
I'm an idiot?

17:22.000 --> 17:24.033
Your pal Martinez
is in the ward

17:24.100 --> 17:25.900
recuperating from something
he caught in solitary.

17:25.967 --> 17:27.700
- Carlos is
in the hospital?

17:27.767 --> 17:29.233
I didn't know that.

17:29.300 --> 17:32.000
- I made it a priority of mine
to keep you and Martinez

17:32.066 --> 17:33.867
as far away from
each other as possible.

17:33.934 --> 17:36.667
That is, until Martinez
admits that you ordered him

17:36.734 --> 17:37.967
to attack Dave Brass.

17:38.033 --> 17:39.633
- That old song
of yours again?

17:39.700 --> 17:41.300
- Yeah, and when he does that,
you're doing down, Morales.

17:41.367 --> 17:42.600
You're going down, down,

17:42.667 --> 17:44.166
down to the lowest pit
with no bottom.

17:44.233 --> 17:46.266
- Fine, I'll just ask McManus
for the transfer.

17:46.333 --> 17:47.266
- Yeah, you go do that.
- I will.

17:47.333 --> 17:48.333
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

17:48.400 --> 17:50.133
- Bye.
- Bye.

17:56.900 --> 17:58.734
- What if Martinez
jabbers on me?

17:58.800 --> 18:00.567
- He hasn't yet.

18:00.633 --> 18:01.900
He never will.

18:01.967 --> 18:04.967
- Now and never is not
the same thing, Chico.

18:05.033 --> 18:08.767
Being in solitary
can wear a man down,

18:08.834 --> 18:10.767
and if Carlos
is sick,

18:10.834 --> 18:14.667
the hacks are withholding
medicine until he turns.

18:14.734 --> 18:16.266
- What could we do?

18:16.333 --> 18:19.133
- Kill him.

18:19.200 --> 18:22.800
- Enrique, no,
he's one of us.

18:22.867 --> 18:25.467
- Yeah, but for how long?

18:25.533 --> 18:27.066
Guard: Lights out!

18:31.066 --> 18:33.066
- A lot of times when
a woman gets pregnant,

18:33.133 --> 18:36.000
her sense of smell
changes for the worse.

18:36.066 --> 18:38.767
Suddenly roses are putrid,

18:38.834 --> 18:41.066
and freshly baked bread,

18:41.133 --> 18:43.800
jeez, it's more like ammonia.

18:43.867 --> 18:45.867
Epileptics got
something similar.

18:45.934 --> 18:49.233
They can often tell when
they're about to do a back flip,

18:49.300 --> 18:52.133
because they start to smell
things that aren't there,

18:52.200 --> 18:54.400
so at least they got
a chance to sit down

18:54.467 --> 18:56.033
before the seizure hits.

18:56.100 --> 18:58.734
With pregnancy
and epilepsy,

18:58.800 --> 19:03.133
you've got a pretty good
sense of impending doom.

19:03.200 --> 19:06.467
Too bad we've got no sense
of how to avoid it.

19:12.133 --> 19:14.700
- I'm here
to work, Stella.

19:14.767 --> 19:15.934
- Hi, Robert.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.600
Give me a hand?

19:18.567 --> 19:22.066
I need you to take
the book cart around today.

19:24.233 --> 19:26.300
- William Blake.
- That's right.

19:26.367 --> 19:27.834
It's the cover to...

19:27.900 --> 19:30.000
"Songs of Experience."

19:31.867 --> 19:34.700
- I never expected to find
a Blake fan in here.

19:34.767 --> 19:38.266
- I'm sorry, I have to ask,
why are you here?

19:38.333 --> 19:42.367
Why would you work in Oz
as opposed to some city library

19:42.433 --> 19:44.967
where you wouldn't be surprised
to find a Blake fan?

19:45.033 --> 19:49.433
- Well, one day
about a year ago,

19:49.500 --> 19:52.600
I was home taking a shower
and I heard a noise.

19:52.667 --> 19:54.300
I came out of
the bathroom,

19:54.367 --> 19:56.400
and there was this kid
standing in the hallway

19:56.467 --> 19:59.533
with my DVD player.

20:00.700 --> 20:03.834
There I am,
"au natural,"

20:03.900 --> 20:07.400
and though I consider
my body a beautiful sight,

20:07.467 --> 20:09.734
the kid freaks
and jumps out the window.

20:09.800 --> 20:11.300
He twists his ankle.

20:11.367 --> 20:14.000
A couple of minutes later
the police pick him up.

20:14.066 --> 20:15.934
It seems he's robbed
other people as well.

20:16.000 --> 20:21.367
So, I go downtown to testify
at some pretrial thing,

20:21.433 --> 20:26.266
and there's the kid,
Jermaine.

20:26.333 --> 20:29.567
So small, so sweet,
sitting next to his mother.

20:29.633 --> 20:32.066
I think,
"He's going to jail."

20:32.133 --> 20:36.700
Then I think, "Christ,
he can have my DVD player."

20:36.767 --> 20:38.567
- You could have
dropped the charges.

20:38.633 --> 20:41.066
- I did, but everyone else
held firm.

20:41.133 --> 20:44.667
I went and visited Jermaine
at juvenile detention

20:44.734 --> 20:46.600
and I said to him,
"Why aren't you in school?"

20:46.667 --> 20:48.200
And you know
what he told me?

20:48.266 --> 20:49.433
- He couldn't read.

20:49.500 --> 20:52.367
- It broke my heart.

20:53.633 --> 21:00.133
I went to Plymouth House
every week and taught him,

21:00.200 --> 21:03.900
and he took to words
like a plant to rain.

21:03.967 --> 21:08.033
His mind was so sharp,
so alive, so thirsty.

21:08.100 --> 21:09.700
- That's wonderful.

21:09.767 --> 21:12.033
- He got stabbed
and died.

21:15.834 --> 21:17.433
And even though
I knew there were

21:17.500 --> 21:18.967
others like him
in Plymouth,

21:19.033 --> 21:20.700
I couldn't go back.

21:21.934 --> 21:25.600
I also know I couldn't
stop what I'd started.

21:25.667 --> 21:28.200
So...

21:28.266 --> 21:29.934
Ta-da.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.100
- You came to a place filled

21:31.166 --> 21:32.734
with old books and bad
attitudes.

21:32.800 --> 21:35.266
- The truth is, Robert,

21:35.333 --> 21:37.166
every book
on these shelves

21:37.233 --> 21:39.166
is new to someone
who hasn't read it.

21:39.233 --> 21:42.367
- You know, Blake,
he said,

21:42.433 --> 21:46.400
"There is a moment in each day
that Satan cannot find."

21:46.467 --> 21:47.800
- That's right.

21:47.867 --> 21:50.166
You know what
my ultimate goal is?

21:50.233 --> 21:55.166
To make that moment
last a lifetime.

22:00.567 --> 22:02.667
- Libros.

22:02.734 --> 22:05.467
Libros para
los muertos.

22:07.100 --> 22:10.033
- Hey, Rebadow, man,
I'll take a novel.

22:10.100 --> 22:12.567
- Which one?

22:12.633 --> 22:14.800
- I don't know.
A long one.

22:14.867 --> 22:16.367
I'm out of
toilet paper.

22:21.166 --> 22:24.500
- Hey, Agamemnon,
recommend something?

22:24.567 --> 22:26.100
- You got any
pop-up books?

22:26.166 --> 22:27.300
I love pop-up books.

22:27.367 --> 22:28.433
- No.

22:28.500 --> 22:29.700
- Then I'm not interested.

22:29.767 --> 22:31.533
Reading confuses me.

22:35.066 --> 22:36.400
- Agamemnon.

22:36.467 --> 22:37.800
- I know what
you're gonna ask.

22:37.867 --> 22:38.800
The answer is no.

22:38.867 --> 22:40.333
- Come on.

22:40.400 --> 22:43.266
This is the third straight
visiting day Norma's come.

22:43.333 --> 22:44.767
- Then tell her to stop.

22:44.834 --> 22:47.033
I've got nothing to say
to the woman who left me

22:47.100 --> 22:48.633
at the altar
and then wham, boom,

22:48.700 --> 22:50.133
shows up a couple
of months later

22:50.200 --> 22:51.834
carrying some
other Joe's child.

22:51.900 --> 22:53.767
- Don't you even want to know
if she's doing okay?

22:53.834 --> 22:54.934
If the child is?

22:55.000 --> 22:56.700
- Well, I'm assuming
they are.

22:56.767 --> 22:59.300
- Fine, assume away.

23:00.734 --> 23:02.967
- Why, is there
something wrong?

23:04.166 --> 23:06.200
Stop yanking
my chain, McManus.

23:06.266 --> 23:08.300
Is Norma all right?

23:08.367 --> 23:09.667
- Ask her yourself.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.333
- So, Norma was here
again today?

23:17.400 --> 23:19.300
- So we're both
in prison?

23:19.367 --> 23:20.834
- Excuse me?

23:20.900 --> 23:22.600
- I'm sorry.

23:22.667 --> 23:23.934
I thought we were
asking questions

23:24.000 --> 23:25.500
that we already knew
the answers to.

23:25.567 --> 23:26.734
- I think you
should see her.

23:26.800 --> 23:29.834
I was talking
to Stella about it and--

23:29.900 --> 23:31.600
- What's Stella have
to do with anything?

23:31.667 --> 23:34.467
- She's a very
smart woman.

23:34.533 --> 23:37.066
She reminded me
of a Blake passage,

23:37.133 --> 23:39.467
some are born
to sweet delight.

23:39.533 --> 23:42.033
Some are born
to endless night.

23:42.100 --> 23:43.667
- Oh, I get it,
I get it.

23:43.734 --> 23:45.166
You're sweet;
I'm endless.

23:45.233 --> 23:47.033
- No, that's not
my point at all.

23:47.100 --> 23:49.567
What Blake is saying is
that every day you're born

23:49.633 --> 23:51.333
and it's your choice.

23:51.400 --> 23:56.033
- See, this is why
I like pop-up books.

23:59.567 --> 24:02.633
- There's a condition
called synesthesia,

24:02.700 --> 24:07.333
makes you associate
letters with color,

24:07.400 --> 24:09.600
sounds with touch.

24:09.667 --> 24:13.333
Imagine reading a book
and being constantly washed

24:13.400 --> 24:16.467
in a cascade
of green and purple,

24:16.533 --> 24:19.033
or hearing
a guitar chord

24:19.100 --> 24:23.033
and feeling it like your
lover's lips against your neck.

24:23.100 --> 24:26.533
Why they call it a condition
I'll never know.

24:26.600 --> 24:29.367
It sounds more
like a blessing,

24:29.433 --> 24:33.867
and just goes to prove that
even the most basic reality

24:33.934 --> 24:37.266
is totally different
for each of us.

24:40.633 --> 24:42.133
- Belial,

24:42.200 --> 24:45.433
bring back the spirits of those
who have gone before,

24:45.500 --> 24:47.867
those dark
and troublesome souls

24:47.934 --> 24:50.967
that spent the last hours
of their lives on death row.

24:51.033 --> 24:53.133
- Kirk, you scum fuck,
quit that shit.

24:53.200 --> 24:54.533
- Praise hell.

24:54.600 --> 24:56.100
Praise Satan.

25:00.233 --> 25:03.200
- Oh, Mukada, you gotta
get Kirk to stop.

25:03.266 --> 25:04.567
He's driving me
fuckin' crazy.

25:04.633 --> 25:06.467
- Believe me,
that's why I'm here.

25:07.700 --> 25:10.333
- Somehow I knew
we'd meet again.

25:10.400 --> 25:12.734
- You wrote a letter
to the cardinal

25:12.800 --> 25:14.467
claiming that I
sexually abused you.

25:14.533 --> 25:16.100
- You touched my penis.

25:16.166 --> 25:18.400
You licked my ear.

25:18.467 --> 25:20.033
- That's a lie.

25:20.100 --> 25:21.567
- I have a meeting
later this week

25:21.633 --> 25:23.500
with the archdiocese
and the cops.

25:23.567 --> 25:28.133
I'm gonna tell them
all the sin-sational details.

25:28.200 --> 25:29.433
- By lying,

25:29.500 --> 25:31.934
you tarnish
the legitimate grievances

25:32.000 --> 25:34.467
of the men and boys who have
been abused by the clergy,

25:34.533 --> 25:36.100
and you do harm
to the many priests

25:36.166 --> 25:39.200
who have lived celibate
and spiritual lives.

25:39.266 --> 25:40.367
- According to
Nostradamus,

25:40.433 --> 25:42.200
the roman church
is almost ready to fall.

25:42.266 --> 25:43.500
- I want you
to tell the truth.

25:43.567 --> 25:45.033
- Let me at him!

25:45.100 --> 25:47.633
I'll squeeze the truth out
of his scrawny little neck.

25:47.700 --> 25:50.066
- Hoyt, you'd think by now you'd
realize that's not the answer.

25:50.133 --> 25:52.433
Hoyt: He's gonna
die anyway.

25:52.500 --> 25:53.700
What's the difference how?

25:53.767 --> 25:55.734
- You asked me
to perform an exorcism,

25:55.800 --> 25:57.066
to free you from
the devil's hold.

25:57.133 --> 25:59.166
I don't know
how to do that,

25:59.233 --> 26:00.867
but I've contacted
an expert who's a priest--

26:00.934 --> 26:03.000
- Too late, Mukada,
as always...

26:03.066 --> 26:04.633
Too late.

26:08.266 --> 26:10.633
When I am executed,

26:10.700 --> 26:13.333
you will be stripped
of your ministry,

26:13.400 --> 26:16.333
you will be abandoned
by Holy Mother Church

26:16.400 --> 26:19.200
and you will spend
the rest of your days

26:19.266 --> 26:22.133
wandering aimlessly
and without hope.

26:26.200 --> 26:27.767
In death...

26:27.834 --> 26:29.600
I will be triumphant.

27:00.033 --> 27:02.367
- A fashion layout?

27:02.433 --> 27:03.567
- Yes.

27:03.633 --> 27:05.934
- With the prisoners
on death row?

27:06.000 --> 27:07.200
- Yes.

27:07.266 --> 27:09.133
- In "Maxim" magazine?

27:09.200 --> 27:10.533
- Yes.

27:10.600 --> 27:13.834
- And why do you think
this is such a good idea?

27:13.900 --> 27:16.934
- The governor's press secretary
believes a photo op

27:17.000 --> 27:19.600
will give a positive spin
to the prison system.

27:19.667 --> 27:22.800
- It seems,
I don't know,

27:22.867 --> 27:25.166
unethical.

27:25.233 --> 27:28.800
- Or for the boys on
the death row, a last hurrah.

27:30.233 --> 27:33.100
- This thing is gonna
work like so.

27:33.166 --> 27:37.033
Each of you clowns is gonna
be photographed individually

27:37.100 --> 27:39.133
in various sets of clothes,

27:39.200 --> 27:41.800
and then a group shot.

27:41.867 --> 27:43.266
Questions?

27:43.333 --> 27:44.300
- Yeah, when's
the magazine come out?

27:44.367 --> 27:45.567
- January.

27:45.633 --> 27:48.033
- Oh, good,
I'll be able to see it.

27:48.100 --> 27:50.166
My execution
isn't until April.

27:50.233 --> 27:51.934
- Great.

27:54.967 --> 27:56.233
- Okay, good.

27:56.300 --> 27:58.133
Let me see
a little smile.

27:59.600 --> 28:01.600
Okay, good.

28:01.667 --> 28:03.867
That's good.
- Hey, ladies.

28:06.533 --> 28:07.967
- Okay, big smile.

28:08.033 --> 28:10.433
- Jericho can smile.

28:11.767 --> 28:13.667
- That's good.

28:13.734 --> 28:15.100
- I need to change
the glass tube in that lamp.

28:15.166 --> 28:16.500
- Okay, great.

28:19.834 --> 28:21.266
- Let's get
this over with.

28:21.333 --> 28:23.767
- Okay, we're ready
for the group shot.

28:28.367 --> 28:30.400
- Let me get you
right behind him.

28:30.467 --> 28:33.166
Let's have you
in the back.

28:34.200 --> 28:36.834
Let's get you
behind them, also.

28:37.934 --> 28:41.533
- You and me, Jaz-bo,
captured on film for posterity.

28:41.600 --> 28:43.767
- Okay, guys,
that looks good.

28:43.834 --> 28:46.300
And look butch.

28:48.266 --> 28:50.066
- Ugh!

28:50.133 --> 28:51.433
- Oh, fuck!

28:51.500 --> 28:52.734
- Shit!

28:56.300 --> 28:58.300
- This time you die,
motherfucker!

28:58.367 --> 29:00.133
- Aaah!

29:07.300 --> 29:09.133
- Haaa!

29:17.066 --> 29:19.233
- I just got a call
from the vicar general.

29:19.300 --> 29:22.200
Because Kirk is dead,

29:22.266 --> 29:24.133
Monsignor Slon
has convinced the police

29:24.200 --> 29:26.000
to drop the investigation
against me.

29:26.066 --> 29:28.166
- You're back.

29:28.233 --> 29:30.200
- Yes.

29:31.934 --> 29:34.367
My prayers
have been answered.

29:35.200 --> 29:37.400
Pete...

29:38.700 --> 29:42.166
I prayed
for Kirk to die.

30:02.700 --> 30:04.867
- I just finished reading
Augustus Hill's memoirs.

30:04.934 --> 30:06.900
- It's remarkable,
isn't it?

30:06.967 --> 30:09.233
- You know, the way that--
that he describes people

30:09.300 --> 30:10.734
and the way things work,

30:10.800 --> 30:13.633
it's the best book about
prison life I've read in years.

30:13.700 --> 30:14.800
- I completely agree.

30:14.867 --> 30:16.367
- Yeah, so what do
we do with it?

30:16.433 --> 30:17.767
- Well...

30:18.567 --> 30:21.200
I've just taken
the liberty of sending

30:21.266 --> 30:23.533
the pages along
to my publisher.

30:24.300 --> 30:26.100
He wants to publish.

30:26.166 --> 30:29.200
- That's terrific.

30:29.266 --> 30:31.166
Have you told Redding
about it?

30:34.633 --> 30:36.667
- I tried.

30:37.667 --> 30:40.467
He didn't seem
to hear me.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.233
- Oh, fuck.

30:49.300 --> 30:53.934
There he goes again,
going around in circles.

30:54.700 --> 30:56.934
- Hey, yo, Burr, man,
you gonna be done soon?

30:57.000 --> 30:58.867
We trying to ball.

31:00.533 --> 31:04.066
- Great, not only ain't
he focused on business,

31:04.133 --> 31:06.266
he gone deaf, too.

31:07.900 --> 31:09.767
I'm telling you, man,

31:09.834 --> 31:12.467
that old
motherfucker's done.

31:12.533 --> 31:15.967
We need young blood
to run the tribe.

31:16.033 --> 31:18.333
You, man.

31:18.400 --> 31:21.233
-  I ain't no
number one, yo.

31:21.300 --> 31:24.567
I already tried it on,
and the shoe does not fit.

31:24.633 --> 31:26.266
- Then who?

31:26.333 --> 31:31.934
- Till we figure that out, bro,
we're stuck with old Burr here.

31:41.000 --> 31:45.133
Oh, yes.

31:45.200 --> 31:47.667
Yes!

31:49.433 --> 31:51.967
- In these tough times,
it's essential

31:52.033 --> 31:54.867
for the state government
to work hand in hand

31:54.934 --> 31:57.000
with business to create
new economic opportunities,

31:57.066 --> 32:00.667
and today I am pleased
to announce

32:00.734 --> 32:03.433
that privately owned
enterprises

32:03.500 --> 32:07.000
will be set up inside
our penitentiaries,

32:07.066 --> 32:11.800
employing prisoners full time
on a merit basis.

32:11.867 --> 32:16.633
The first programs will be
set up in the Oswald

32:16.700 --> 32:19.967
and Parker women's
correctional facilities.

32:20.033 --> 32:22.800
- Well, shit.

32:24.200 --> 32:25.367
Said,

32:25.433 --> 32:28.033
I've been thinking
about what you said,

32:28.100 --> 32:32.166
how I'm a leader
who does not truly lead.

32:32.233 --> 32:35.934
I've been dwelling on all
the shit that I done caused.

32:36.000 --> 32:39.200
I got Augustus killed.

32:39.266 --> 32:41.767
I got young boys
out there slinging tits.

32:41.834 --> 32:44.767
Well, I can't
do it anymore,

32:44.834 --> 32:47.000
and I won't let them
do it either.

32:47.066 --> 32:49.900
- I'm very happy
to hear that.

32:49.967 --> 32:51.800
- I got this idea,

32:51.867 --> 32:55.233
but I need to talk
to McManus upstairs.

32:55.300 --> 32:58.734
But Burr Redding, he ain't
got much credibility anymore.

32:58.800 --> 33:01.433
- So what do you want me to do,
go see him for you?

33:01.500 --> 33:03.900
- I want you
to be there with me.

33:03.967 --> 33:07.834
Your presence is gonna
give me a voice.

33:07.900 --> 33:10.400
- Okay.

33:10.467 --> 33:12.567
But what's your idea?

33:12.633 --> 33:15.066
- Well, in order to get my boys
to stop selling them tits,

33:15.133 --> 33:17.367
I got to give them
an alternative.

33:18.767 --> 33:22.033
We're gonna
get real jobs.

33:22.867 --> 33:24.033
- The young lady at the other
end

33:24.100 --> 33:25.834
of the table is Donna
Degenhart.

33:25.900 --> 33:29.000
She's the owner of
this new enterprise in Oz.

33:29.066 --> 33:30.166
Donna.

33:30.233 --> 33:32.333
- Thanks to all of you
in advance

33:32.400 --> 33:34.000
for helping me
create my company.

33:34.066 --> 33:35.967
- What exactly
is your company?

33:36.033 --> 33:37.233
- Telemarketing.

33:37.300 --> 33:39.433
I'll hire inmates
to man phone banks

33:39.500 --> 33:42.600
and control databases
for businesses on the outside.

33:42.667 --> 33:44.033
- Like, who?

33:44.100 --> 33:46.767
- Long-distance providers,
public opinion pollsters,

33:46.834 --> 33:49.900
charities, airline reservations,
you name it.

33:49.967 --> 33:53.033
- You do this, what happens
to Kentwell Communications?

33:53.100 --> 33:54.533
- I'm sorry?

33:54.600 --> 33:56.800
- The telemarketing company
that's already in town.

33:56.867 --> 33:58.867
- Well, we're not putting
anyone out of business.

33:58.934 --> 34:00.700
The market can bear
two companies.

34:00.767 --> 34:03.700
- And you know this through
your extensive experience?

34:03.767 --> 34:06.700
- I know this because
36 other states have

34:06.767 --> 34:08.633
implemented
similar programs,

34:08.700 --> 34:11.600
and the benefits inside far
outweigh any small complications

34:11.667 --> 34:13.400
that may
arise outside.

34:13.467 --> 34:17.233
- Oh, gee, seems
I hear that every time

34:17.300 --> 34:18.800
we kick-start something.

34:18.867 --> 34:21.266
And how often does that
work out for us?

34:21.333 --> 34:23.333
- For Chrissakes,
Howell, what do you

34:23.400 --> 34:24.934
got stock in
Kentwell Communications?

34:25.000 --> 34:27.867
- No, a brother.

34:33.333 --> 34:34.667
- We want to get involved

34:34.734 --> 34:36.400
in this new business
that's coming in.

34:36.467 --> 34:40.100
- So, fill out
an application.

34:41.166 --> 34:43.500
- Well, we was thinking
about something

34:43.567 --> 34:44.900
a little more
proactive.

34:44.967 --> 34:46.033
- Proactive?

34:46.100 --> 34:47.433
What, you been
coaching him?

34:47.500 --> 34:49.767
- McManus, I know what you
suspect

34:49.834 --> 34:51.300
me of doing inside these walls,

34:51.367 --> 34:53.834
and if you believe
your suspicions,

34:53.900 --> 34:57.166
you gotta admit, I run
a business better than most.

34:57.233 --> 34:59.800
- So, you'd both
serve as foremen?

34:59.867 --> 35:01.300
- Exactly.

35:01.367 --> 35:03.667
- Yeah, see, I really
don't have the money

35:03.734 --> 35:05.266
in my budget
for two positions.

35:05.333 --> 35:06.667
- Well, Ms. Degenhart,

35:06.734 --> 35:08.266
that brings me to
a question that I have.

35:08.333 --> 35:09.967
Your employees,

35:10.033 --> 35:12.834
they make
minimum wage?

35:12.900 --> 35:13.934
- No.

35:14.000 --> 35:15.533
No, not even close.

35:15.600 --> 35:16.934
- So, they make
a pittance.

35:17.000 --> 35:19.300
- Well, I mean no disrespect,
Minister Said,

35:19.367 --> 35:23.066
when I say it's honest people
who deserve an honest wage.

35:23.133 --> 35:26.467
- Besides, Said, this is more
than the $2.50 a week

35:26.533 --> 35:29.066
you're currently making
in receiving and discharge.

35:29.133 --> 35:31.100
- That's like telling
a slave it's not all bad

35:31.166 --> 35:33.000
because he gets
to work with his family

35:33.066 --> 35:34.667
inside the master's house.

35:34.734 --> 35:36.333
- Oh, come on, Said.

35:36.400 --> 35:37.767
The woman just trying to get
the operation off the ground.

35:37.834 --> 35:39.266
- At whose expense?

35:39.333 --> 35:41.800
- Look, I have no intention
of exploiting anyone.

35:41.867 --> 35:44.133
- Sometimes that
just comes naturally.

35:44.200 --> 35:47.567
Sadly, the thing about
business at its core,

35:47.633 --> 35:51.266
it is always just business.

35:52.200 --> 35:54.367
I've decided
the Muslims

35:54.433 --> 35:58.367
will not participate.

36:01.367 --> 36:02.967
Excuse me.

36:06.767 --> 36:10.467
- Well, ain't but
one thing I got to say.

36:11.300 --> 36:12.800
Fuck him.

36:12.867 --> 36:16.600
I'll work for nothing until
you hit your profits bull's-eye.

36:17.533 --> 36:20.400
- Well, my foreman.

36:20.467 --> 36:22.133
- Yes.

36:22.200 --> 36:26.166
- "And life to me
is--is--is about living,

36:26.233 --> 36:29.200
"feelings and all
and trying not to fall

36:29.266 --> 36:31.700
"into them hard places
inside you

36:31.767 --> 36:33.967
"created by them
hard places around you.

36:34.033 --> 36:36.033
"It's a I don't
give a fuck song,

36:36.100 --> 36:38.000
"set to the tune
of the bullshit that bore you.

36:38.066 --> 36:41.567
"The place between dreams
is--is a situation

36:41.633 --> 36:43.734
"signifying nothing.

36:43.800 --> 36:45.200
"So to me,

36:45.266 --> 36:48.900
"I'm just fixing my mind
to just enjoy the dream,

36:48.967 --> 36:53.300
"'cause everything else,
when I ain't asleep is gray,

36:53.367 --> 36:55.967
"and life is about
wherever you gonna get to,

36:56.033 --> 36:57.500
getting got to."

36:57.567 --> 37:01.400
Man, Augustus,
this poem is for you.

37:05.300 --> 37:07.033
- The meeting
didn't go well.

37:07.100 --> 37:08.700
- How can you tell?

37:08.767 --> 37:10.900
- Your eyes are
filled with rage.

37:10.967 --> 37:12.133
- Hmph.

37:12.200 --> 37:14.600
Arif, my heart is filled
with disappointment.

37:14.667 --> 37:17.934
How come all good things
have to have a bad thing

37:18.000 --> 37:19.400
attached to them?

37:19.467 --> 37:22.333
- If faith were easy,
everyone would believe.

37:22.400 --> 37:24.867
Those are your
own words, minister.

37:24.934 --> 37:27.000
- Yeah, hmph.

37:27.066 --> 37:29.100
There's got to be
a way, Arif,

37:29.166 --> 37:31.667
to do business without
cheating all the workers.

37:31.734 --> 37:33.834
- Economics is not
my strong suit.

37:33.900 --> 37:36.233
- Yeah.

37:36.300 --> 37:38.367
- Where you going?

37:39.367 --> 37:41.100
- To think.

37:41.667 --> 37:43.000
Just to think.

38:25.834 --> 38:27.834
- Man, I wish to Christ
I could figure out

38:27.900 --> 38:29.200
what Redding
is up to.

38:29.266 --> 38:30.700
- Rumor is he's walking away
from the kitchen,

38:30.767 --> 38:33.700
that he's gonna be foreman
on the telemarketing business.

38:33.767 --> 38:35.533
- That don't mean
he'll stop slinging.

38:35.600 --> 38:37.800
And what we need
is some information.

38:37.867 --> 38:38.900
Alvarez.

38:38.967 --> 38:40.533
Join us.

38:40.600 --> 38:42.633
- You want me
to sit with you?

38:42.700 --> 38:45.967
- Yeah, I figure you
and Guerra made peace,

38:46.033 --> 38:48.100
you won't be stabbing each other
with the silverware.

38:48.166 --> 38:50.066
Besides,
I got a question.

38:50.133 --> 38:52.333
- Nine inches, baby.

38:55.133 --> 38:57.033
- You friendly with
any of the niggers?

38:57.100 --> 38:58.633
- No.

38:58.700 --> 39:00.567
Poet a little bit,
maybe.

39:00.633 --> 39:01.734
- Yeah.

39:01.800 --> 39:03.834
He knows you and us
have been at war.

39:03.900 --> 39:05.400
I want you
to talk to him,

39:05.467 --> 39:08.633
find out what Redding's
real plans are.

39:09.400 --> 39:10.800
- Spy.

39:10.867 --> 39:13.467
- Well, yeah.

39:15.734 --> 39:17.233
- I ain't hungry anymore.

39:17.300 --> 39:18.900
- Do this, Miguel.

39:18.967 --> 39:21.066
We'll welcome you
back into El Notre.

39:21.133 --> 39:24.200
- You know, I'm...

39:24.266 --> 39:26.967
I'm glad me and Chico aren't
at each other's throats anymore,

39:27.033 --> 39:29.233
but that's as far
as it goes, man.

39:29.300 --> 39:31.266
I got my parole
in three years.

39:31.333 --> 39:36.734
Until that point,
I'm Mahatma-fuckin'-Ghandi.

39:39.533 --> 39:41.400
You want
the peach cobbler?

39:48.300 --> 39:50.166
- Miguelito...

39:50.233 --> 39:52.400
You look great.

39:52.467 --> 39:55.500
- Yeah, and you look
really young.

39:55.567 --> 39:58.200
What's up with the visit
after all this time?

39:58.266 --> 40:01.567
- Do I need more of a reason
than you're my son?

40:01.633 --> 40:03.967
- Yeah. It didn't matter much
before, did it?

40:04.033 --> 40:05.567
- Well, maybe
I haven't been here

40:05.633 --> 40:07.133
'cause you're
always in solitary

40:07.200 --> 40:09.300
or in the hole or escaping
and not even coming to see me.

40:09.367 --> 40:11.400
When would I have
a chance to visit, huh?

40:11.467 --> 40:15.100
- You just came here to make
my life more fucked up, right?

40:15.166 --> 40:16.967
- Thank you.

40:17.033 --> 40:20.734
- Be Mr. Macho Muchacho
all you want,

40:20.800 --> 40:22.767
but if you're so tough,

40:22.834 --> 40:26.834
think what that says about
the bitch that bore you.

40:30.867 --> 40:32.934
- You're a tough bitch.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.633
Yeah.

40:36.867 --> 40:39.734
You do bore me.

40:43.100 --> 40:45.300
Okay, I'm glad
you came.

40:49.600 --> 40:53.834
You know, when I escaped,
I didn't come to see you

40:53.900 --> 40:56.200
because I thought
that'd be the first place

40:56.266 --> 40:57.667
the cops would look.

40:57.734 --> 40:59.433
- It was.

41:01.100 --> 41:02.700
- How's Maritza doing?

41:02.767 --> 41:05.767
- She's wonderful.

41:05.834 --> 41:07.266
- She fuckin' anybody?

41:07.333 --> 41:10.300
- She's working
as a travel agent

41:10.367 --> 41:13.133
sending people to Europe,
Japan, Australia.

41:13.200 --> 41:15.533
- Ma, I asked you
a question.

41:15.600 --> 41:19.200
- I speak to her once,
maybe twice a month.

41:19.266 --> 41:22.233
I don't think she is.

41:22.300 --> 41:25.300
- You tell her that
she gotta come visit me.

41:25.367 --> 41:28.934
- That would mean a lot more
coming from you.

41:29.000 --> 41:31.367
- I ain't gonna ask.
I ain't gonna beg.

41:31.433 --> 41:33.834
She should
just show up.

42:10.200 --> 42:11.133
Shit.

42:11.200 --> 42:12.600
- Hey, it's Maritza.

42:12.667 --> 42:14.133
I'm not home,
so please leave a message.

42:16.333 --> 42:20.433
Hey, Ritz.

42:20.500 --> 42:24.767
Thinking about you
a lot lately.

42:24.834 --> 42:26.700
Ma told me how good
you were doing, you know,

42:26.767 --> 42:29.800
sending people all over
the world and stuff.

42:31.767 --> 42:36.100
You know, I hope
you don't forget

42:36.166 --> 42:38.133
that I'm still part of yours,

42:38.200 --> 42:42.700
because, baby,
you're still most of mine.

42:46.934 --> 42:52.033
I know that
I haven't been the best,

42:52.100 --> 42:53.767
you know...

42:53.834 --> 42:57.333
of anything the last
couple of years,

42:57.400 --> 43:00.834
but if, um...

43:00.900 --> 43:04.467
you could use some
of that travel agent,

43:04.533 --> 43:07.700
you know, magic
to arrange for a car,

43:07.767 --> 43:09.166
go to Oz...

43:11.066 --> 43:16.166
Damn, I'd make
that trip worthwhile.

43:16.734 --> 43:18.500
I promise.

43:21.467 --> 43:24.500
All right.

43:24.567 --> 43:25.800
I love you.

43:28.233 --> 43:31.233
And I miss you,
Maritza.

43:34.000 --> 43:35.300
Yeah, I really do.

43:38.467 --> 43:41.900
Please come.

43:41.967 --> 43:44.000
Yeah, please come.

43:51.767 --> 43:54.200
- Let's say a young man
mugs someone.

43:54.266 --> 43:57.300
A young girl steals
20 purses from Sears.

43:57.367 --> 44:00.767
A young mother
drowns her daughter.

44:00.834 --> 44:05.734
The one thing they're all
said to lack is common sense.

44:05.800 --> 44:09.233
Somewhere along the way
they lost their ability

44:09.300 --> 44:11.266
to think correctly.

44:11.333 --> 44:13.367
Well, look at Oz.

44:13.433 --> 44:17.533
Common sense creates
the common criminal.

44:17.600 --> 44:19.767
The desire to do right

44:19.834 --> 44:24.533
is probably the most
uncommon sense of all.

44:26.000 --> 44:27.100
- Father.

44:27.166 --> 44:28.266
Father,
what's the matter?

44:28.333 --> 44:29.567
- Help, help!

44:29.633 --> 44:30.767
Dr. Nathan:
Get me that crash cart!

44:30.834 --> 44:32.066
- Help!
- Father Meehan's dead.

44:32.133 --> 44:33.233
- Oh, fuck.

44:35.433 --> 44:36.900
- Hey, O'Reily,

44:36.967 --> 44:40.133
I heard our pal Father Meehan
crashed and burned.

44:40.200 --> 44:43.200
That must be tearing
you up inside, huh?

44:43.266 --> 44:45.000
- Yeah,
he was a good man.

44:45.066 --> 44:46.500
- Yeah.

44:46.567 --> 44:48.500
Well, I guess now you got
a little taste of what

44:48.567 --> 44:50.133
it felt like when you
murdered my father.

44:50.200 --> 44:51.233
- We're done talking, bitch.

44:51.300 --> 44:52.900
- Oh, okay.

44:52.967 --> 44:55.233
I was just wondering how you're
gonna feel when Cyril dies.

44:57.667 --> 44:59.133
- We're appealing
Cyril's case.

44:59.200 --> 45:01.367
- And your ma.

45:02.433 --> 45:05.767
- What?
- Your ma.

45:08.266 --> 45:10.200
- You go anywhere
near my mother,

45:10.266 --> 45:12.133
I'll fuckin'
skin you alive.

45:12.200 --> 45:14.200
- I don't have
to touch her.

45:14.266 --> 45:15.900
I got the evil eye,
remember?

45:15.967 --> 45:17.633
- Yeah, whatever.

45:17.700 --> 45:19.900
- Okay, that's what
killed Meehan, you know.

45:19.967 --> 45:21.700
My wife's grandmother put
the evil eye on the fat fuck

45:21.767 --> 45:23.333
and he was dead
within hours.

45:23.400 --> 45:25.700
- You know, Schibetta, you
really do belong in psych, man.

45:25.767 --> 45:27.300
You're fuckin' nuts.

45:27.367 --> 45:29.567
- Meehan gave me
his rosary.

45:29.633 --> 45:32.100
That's all you need,

45:32.166 --> 45:33.633
a possession of the person
you want cursed.

45:33.700 --> 45:35.734
I gave the rosary
to my wife

45:35.800 --> 45:39.033
to give to her nana--
arrivederci, Meehan.

45:39.100 --> 45:41.333
I'm gonna put the curse on
every single person you love,

45:41.400 --> 45:44.533
and when you can't stand
the grief one more second,

45:44.600 --> 45:47.133
I'm gonna
put it on you.

45:48.000 --> 45:51.333
And I'll be smiling when you're
twisting in your own shit.

45:51.400 --> 45:53.467
- Hey, you fucking dago,
you motherfucker.

45:53.533 --> 45:55.800
Fuckin'--

45:56.967 --> 46:00.100
It's okay, man,
momentary lapse.

46:00.166 --> 46:01.300
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

46:01.367 --> 46:04.033
Okay, come on,
let's take 'em down.

46:11.066 --> 46:12.533
- Hey, Chucky.

46:12.600 --> 46:14.000
You got a minute?

46:14.066 --> 46:17.266
- For you, O'Reily,
I got only 28 seconds,

46:17.333 --> 46:20.500
but the way you double-talk,
it should be plenty.

46:20.567 --> 46:22.800
- Peter Schibetta.

46:22.867 --> 46:25.000
He's walking around saying
he can put curses on people.

46:25.066 --> 46:26.900
- The evil eye, sure.

46:26.967 --> 46:29.233
- Well, he says that
his wife's grandmother,

46:29.300 --> 46:30.433
she's got the power.

46:30.500 --> 46:31.934
- Petey's got
two screws loose.

46:32.000 --> 46:33.867
- Oh, man, I feel a lot
better hearing that,

46:33.934 --> 46:35.333
'cause um...

46:35.400 --> 46:37.767
not only did he say
that he put a curse on me,

46:37.834 --> 46:40.700
he said he put
a curse on you.

46:40.767 --> 46:42.900
Yeah, that's
what he said.

46:43.000 --> 46:45.467
I think he still blames you
for him taking it up the ass,

46:45.533 --> 46:47.066
twice.

46:47.133 --> 46:49.266
- That fuckin'
little prick.

46:49.333 --> 46:51.033
- Maybe you should
go talk to Peter, huh?

46:51.100 --> 46:54.333
- Yeah, maybe I should.

46:54.400 --> 46:55.967
- Yeah.

47:07.767 --> 47:10.367
- You see, when you say
"screw your courage

47:10.433 --> 47:11.700
to the sticking place,"

47:11.767 --> 47:13.667
what you're saying is
have some balls,

47:13.734 --> 47:15.200
keep on track.

47:15.266 --> 47:17.934
- Oh.

47:18.000 --> 47:20.233
But screw your courage
to the sticking place

47:20.300 --> 47:21.700
and will not fail.

47:21.767 --> 47:22.867
- Good.

47:22.934 --> 47:24.300
- Then I explain
the murder plan.

47:24.367 --> 47:26.300
- Right.

47:26.367 --> 47:27.567
- All right,
that's it.

47:27.633 --> 47:29.100
We start up again
tomorrow at 3:00.

47:29.166 --> 47:31.100
- All right, thank you very
much; we'll see you later.

47:31.166 --> 47:33.800
- Suzanne, I've got to tell you,
I'm having the best time.

47:33.867 --> 47:36.367
I've got to go meet
my wife right now,

47:36.433 --> 47:38.467
but I can't wait to
tell her all about you.

47:38.533 --> 47:41.333
- Thanks,
we'll see you later.

47:47.333 --> 47:49.133
- Hey, have you heard
from the lawyer

47:49.200 --> 47:50.633
about the exact date
of Cyril's appeal?

47:50.700 --> 47:53.734
- Well, all's Alman said
was sometime this week.

47:55.033 --> 47:56.333
Damn.

47:56.400 --> 47:58.000
- What's the matter?

47:58.066 --> 47:59.934
- I can't find
my car keys.

48:00.000 --> 48:01.400
- What?

48:01.467 --> 48:02.834
- Yeah, I was sure
I left them right here.

48:02.900 --> 48:05.767
- Oh, Christ, mom,
I bet Schibetta stole them.

48:05.834 --> 48:07.400
He's gonna put
a curse on you.

48:07.467 --> 48:08.734
I got--I gotta go.
- Oh, Ryan.

48:08.800 --> 48:10.500
- No, I gotta go.
- Slow down, O'Reily.

48:10.567 --> 48:11.834
- No, I got
an emergency.

48:11.900 --> 48:13.033
- What emergency?

48:13.100 --> 48:14.233
- I can't explain,
just let me go.

48:14.300 --> 48:16.133
You ain't going anywhere.
- Fuck.

48:23.600 --> 48:25.400
- Yo, yo, yo,
Petey, what's up?

48:25.467 --> 48:26.867
- Chucky, boys,
long time no see.

48:26.934 --> 48:28.734
- Petey,
where you going?

48:28.800 --> 48:30.000
- Visit with my wife.

48:30.066 --> 48:32.333
- Uh-uh.
We called and canceled.

48:32.400 --> 48:33.734
- Why?

48:33.800 --> 48:35.700
- You and me, we have
to have a little chat.

48:35.767 --> 48:39.633
- About?
- Life and death.

48:39.700 --> 48:41.400
My life, your death.

48:41.467 --> 48:43.533
- Chucky, no!

48:48.166 --> 48:51.166
- Warden, you better come
and see this.

49:02.000 --> 49:05.667
- Well, I can't say
I'm sorry Schibetta's dead.

49:09.433 --> 49:12.500
What's that?

49:12.567 --> 49:13.600
- His eye.

49:16.533 --> 49:19.066
- Lockdown!
Lockdown!

49:19.133 --> 49:21.200
- What the fuck
is going on, man?

49:21.266 --> 49:23.066
- O'Reily.

49:23.133 --> 49:24.934
Catch.

49:36.800 --> 49:38.600
- There's our
little prick.

49:38.667 --> 49:42.633
Robson, you shanked me,
and I almost died.

49:42.700 --> 49:44.600
You're going
to wish I had.

49:44.667 --> 49:46.133
- Officer!
Officer!

49:46.200 --> 49:47.166
Officer!

49:47.233 --> 49:48.233
- You boys
cut the shit.

49:48.300 --> 49:50.900
Outta here,
let's go.

49:57.867 --> 50:00.066
- Holy shit.

50:04.266 --> 50:05.734
- Yeah.

50:16.033 --> 50:17.467
Vern,
I need your help.

50:17.533 --> 50:18.967
- Keep walking.

50:19.033 --> 50:22.900
- After all I've done for
the brotherhood, you owe me.

50:22.967 --> 50:25.667
- Hey, you heard the man,
keep walking.

50:25.734 --> 50:28.033
- Watch your mouth, prag.

50:31.333 --> 50:33.567
- I'm not a prag anymore, pal,
and as for watching my mouth,

50:33.633 --> 50:35.867
you're the one
with the nigger gums.

50:35.934 --> 50:37.400
Bye-bye.

50:50.033 --> 50:52.900
- You know what
true boredom is?

50:52.967 --> 50:55.000
True boredom is when
you want to get yourself off

50:55.066 --> 50:58.166
and you don't want to
at exactly the same time.

50:58.233 --> 51:01.700
- Listen, Cutler, the wops
have got it out for me.

51:01.767 --> 51:03.433
I need
your protection.

51:03.500 --> 51:08.633
In return, I'll steal,
I'll shank, you name it.

51:08.700 --> 51:11.500
I need your clout
to keep my ass safe.

51:11.567 --> 51:13.600
- Well, if that's
what you want,

51:13.667 --> 51:15.266
I'm afraid your ass
is the one thing

51:15.333 --> 51:16.867
that's not gonna
be safe...

51:16.934 --> 51:18.200
Prag.

51:18.266 --> 51:20.667
- I'm no bitch.

51:20.734 --> 51:21.967
- Then ciao, baby.

51:22.033 --> 51:25.533
If you want
to stay alive...

51:30.300 --> 51:33.867
Come get poppa
out of his boredom.

51:47.734 --> 51:50.400
- I don't really have anyone
else to talk to in this place.

51:50.467 --> 51:53.734
- That's what
I'm here for.

51:56.633 --> 51:58.734
- You ever been
scared of dying?

51:58.800 --> 52:02.400
- Oh, yeah.

52:03.433 --> 52:08.633
My first year here,
a man named Warren Sticks.

52:08.700 --> 52:09.967
We were in the middle
of a session,

52:10.033 --> 52:13.333
and suddenly he leaped
out of his chair

52:13.400 --> 52:16.300
and started
to choke me.

52:16.367 --> 52:20.133
I blacked out,
and when I came to

52:20.200 --> 52:22.767
I was lying in
a pool of blood,

52:22.834 --> 52:25.033
his blood.

52:25.100 --> 52:29.500
He had slit his wrists with
the edge of my tape dispenser.

52:29.567 --> 52:32.934
I realized he was...

52:33.000 --> 52:35.133
Attempting to
knock me out

52:35.200 --> 52:36.967
so he could
kill himself.

52:37.033 --> 52:39.100
- You remember
that sensation,

52:39.166 --> 52:44.533
thinking you were
gonna die?

52:44.600 --> 52:46.000
- Is that how
you feel now?

52:46.066 --> 52:49.066
- I felt that way
every day

52:49.133 --> 52:51.367
since as long
as I could remember.

52:51.433 --> 52:53.166
- How far back
is that?

52:53.233 --> 52:56.033
- Much further
than I'd like.

52:59.266 --> 53:01.633
I was Gerald Robson's
only child.

53:01.700 --> 53:03.667
Even as a kid,

53:03.734 --> 53:07.400
you do what
you gotta do to survive...

53:08.834 --> 53:14.500
'Cause when you're six,
running away is not an option.

53:16.100 --> 53:18.033
- Did he beat you?

53:18.100 --> 53:20.433
- Oh, yeah.

53:21.533 --> 53:23.467
And worse.

53:24.667 --> 53:28.800
- Did he abuse you
sexually?

53:33.967 --> 53:36.667
It's funny,
here I am 36 years old,

53:36.734 --> 53:38.867
and I got nowhere to run.

53:40.967 --> 53:44.333
You know,
and I--I guess what...

53:44.400 --> 53:45.834
What I want
to know is,

53:45.900 --> 53:52.767
is it okay to do
whatever is necessary...

53:52.834 --> 53:54.333
to survive?

53:54.400 --> 53:56.166
- Is what okay?

53:56.233 --> 54:00.533
- Or should I die?

54:00.600 --> 54:02.934
Uh, no, no, but--

54:03.000 --> 54:06.033
- That's what I figured.

54:06.100 --> 54:07.500
Thanks, sister.

54:10.600 --> 54:12.433
- Sometimes
the worst thing,

54:12.500 --> 54:16.166
the worst possible
fuckin' state of being...

54:16.233 --> 54:17.967
- Is having all your senses
workin' full tilt.

54:18.033 --> 54:20.400
How can that be bad?

54:20.467 --> 54:22.967
Well, there are
certain things we do

54:23.033 --> 54:25.000
when seen, touched,
heard, smelled

54:25.066 --> 54:26.600
and tasted
all at the same time

54:26.667 --> 54:28.734
that'll make you wish
you were dead.

54:43.567 --> 54:45.433
- Lick this.

54:48.967 --> 54:51.333
That's right,
lick it real good.

54:51.400 --> 54:52.867
Now give it
back to me.

54:57.467 --> 54:59.166
Drop your pants.

55:03.533 --> 55:05.834
Now bend over.

55:06.300 --> 55:07.533
- What?

55:07.600 --> 55:10.133
- You and me,
we're gonna spoon.

55:10.200 --> 55:12.200
Now bend
the fuck over.
