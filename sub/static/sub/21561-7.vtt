00:45.504 --> 00:46.770
Detail!

00:46.773 --> 00:48.898
Ten hut!

00:48.900 --> 00:50.500
Dismissed.

00:54.064 --> 00:56.615
Never again.

00:56.618 --> 00:57.951
You hear me, Miller?

00:57.954 --> 01:01.138
We don't let something like
this happen to us again.

01:10.807 --> 01:12.287
You okay, Master Chief?

01:12.290 --> 01:14.457
Never mind. We've all
seen better days, Doc.

01:14.459 --> 01:15.925
No, I mean...

01:19.164 --> 01:21.330
Yes, Master Chief. Never mind.

01:25.592 --> 01:28.274
Ray.

01:28.277 --> 01:30.206
Your hand... it's shaking.

01:30.208 --> 01:33.038
Y-Yeah. Yeah. I just, um...

01:33.041 --> 01:36.309
I-I was gripping the
helm so tight, my hand...

01:56.100 --> 01:58.801
Flight op's complete.
Helo's back in the hangar.

01:58.803 --> 02:01.657
They didn't find anything out
there. No sign of Fletcher.

02:01.663 --> 02:03.863
Those seeds are long gone.

02:03.865 --> 02:06.032
We went at the refugees again, hard.

02:06.034 --> 02:07.567
They're sticking to their story.

02:07.569 --> 02:10.235
The so-called "Captain"
boarded their trawler late,

02:10.238 --> 02:13.106
replacing the smuggler they all
paid to sneak them into Europe.

02:13.108 --> 02:15.508
Fletcher and the boat captain
were seen talking in helo bay

02:15.510 --> 02:18.278
- on multiple occasions.
- Oh, God.

02:18.280 --> 02:21.681
Any thoughts where we should
start looking for those seeds?

02:21.683 --> 02:24.884
Giorgio has a yacht. Fast one.

02:24.886 --> 02:27.988
If he was waiting for
Fletcher beyond Asteris Island,

02:27.990 --> 02:29.856
they could be headed back to his place.

02:29.858 --> 02:31.891
The house that was
communicating with the lab.

02:33.695 --> 02:35.404
Am I missing something?

02:35.405 --> 02:38.097
Just the way fate works.

02:38.100 --> 02:40.000
When you first came aboard,

02:40.002 --> 02:43.770
you proposed using Giorgio's
house to find Vellek's lab.

02:43.772 --> 02:47.407
I thought it was a... crazy plan.

02:47.409 --> 02:50.076
And now...

02:50.078 --> 02:51.411
I think it's our only hope.

02:51.413 --> 02:54.481
Giorgio's house... You know where it is?

02:54.483 --> 02:57.684
I have an idea.

03:21.476 --> 03:22.909
Well?

03:26.982 --> 03:30.350
You see? I told you. We did it.

03:30.352 --> 03:31.627
Tell us, Papa.

03:31.628 --> 03:33.486
The virus weathered two ice ages.

03:33.488 --> 03:36.556
It didn't just jump
species, it jumped kingdoms,

03:36.558 --> 03:39.626
and it unleashed the
most massive twin pandemic

03:39.628 --> 03:41.428
the world has ever known.

03:41.430 --> 03:46.933
Yet this seed, this small
palm, Elaeis Virilis,

03:46.935 --> 03:48.935
survived all of it.

03:48.937 --> 03:52.467
I'm now going to take a bit
of the genius of Mother Nature,

03:52.470 --> 03:55.775
I am going to mix it with my own,

03:55.777 --> 03:58.778
and I'm going to save this planet

03:58.780 --> 04:01.781
in an act of such benevolence

04:01.783 --> 04:03.550
that people will question

04:03.552 --> 04:07.420
why they ever believed in any other God.

04:09.157 --> 04:11.357
Buckle up, Commander.
You're about to bear witness

04:11.359 --> 04:13.586
to the recreation of the human being.

04:13.587 --> 04:16.177
I'm here because my nation needs to eat.

04:16.180 --> 04:18.197
And eat they will, thanks to you.

04:18.200 --> 04:21.434
Well, I kind of helped, too.

04:23.205 --> 04:25.905
Go have a drink, Giorgio.

04:25.907 --> 04:28.141
Men are talking here.

04:38.353 --> 04:40.053
Nice.

04:41.573 --> 04:44.891
You'll have to excuse my
middle child, Commander.

04:44.893 --> 04:47.494
32 Aprils ago, his
mother crapped him out,

04:47.496 --> 04:49.165
and he's been fouling
up things up ever since.

04:49.167 --> 04:52.464
- Dad...
- But you, you did good, man.

04:52.467 --> 04:55.268
Commander, your partner was
supposed to sneak the seeds

04:55.270 --> 04:58.471
off that ship without
giving away your involvement,

04:58.473 --> 05:00.807
which means Tom Chandler is on to you,

05:00.809 --> 05:03.943
and he'll be coming after us all.

05:06.615 --> 05:08.745
I suggest we work quickly,

05:08.748 --> 05:10.715
avoid direct conflict with him.

05:10.718 --> 05:12.585
You've seen how dangerous he can be.

05:13.789 --> 05:14.995
Leave Chandler to me.

05:14.998 --> 05:17.257
I have total trust in Lucia.
But right now, darling,

05:17.259 --> 05:20.460
why don't you make our...
Our guest comfortable?

05:23.265 --> 05:27.934
Not too comfortable, sweetheart.

05:36.144 --> 05:39.312
Lucia's right, Dad. We're
not out of the woods yet.

05:39.314 --> 05:42.348
Fletcher's escape wasn't
exactly according to plan.

05:42.350 --> 05:44.017
You think it was by design?

05:44.019 --> 05:45.718
I think you should keep an eye on him.

05:45.720 --> 05:49.155
It's always good to worry,
as your mother used to say.

05:49.157 --> 05:51.191
But right now, we need
to roll up our sleeves

05:51.193 --> 05:53.393
and get to work, my
boy. What do you say?

05:53.395 --> 05:55.228
Yes, Sir.

05:57.966 --> 06:00.466
Let's do this together, son.

06:06.308 --> 06:07.807
This is from the hard drive.

06:07.809 --> 06:09.642
We haven't had a satellite
flyover in months,

06:09.644 --> 06:11.010
so no recent images.

06:11.012 --> 06:13.913
What I'm looking for has
been around 2,000 years.

06:13.915 --> 06:17.617
That small island near Ithaca.

06:17.619 --> 06:19.586
That structure off Atokos,

06:19.588 --> 06:22.555
that's the watchtower I saw
outside Giorgio's mansion.

06:22.557 --> 06:24.657
Bridge, this is the Captain.

06:24.659 --> 06:28.428
Set a course heading
0-6-5, all ahead flank.

06:44.079 --> 06:45.812
Everyone, listen up!

06:45.814 --> 06:50.423
I want you to reach far,
I want you to reach wide,

06:50.426 --> 06:51.959
and I want you to line up

06:51.962 --> 06:55.989
every fine piece of
ass in the Peloponnese,

06:55.991 --> 06:59.525
'cause today, we're
gonna tear it up, boys.

07:01.429 --> 07:03.263
Tear it up.

07:03.265 --> 07:05.732
Don't say I didn't do my part.

07:05.734 --> 07:07.734
I did my part. I helped.

07:12.307 --> 07:14.307
Mission is a straightforward
smash and grab.

07:14.309 --> 07:15.509
Target... secure map room

07:15.512 --> 07:17.977
located in the northeast
wing of Giorgio's mansion,

07:17.979 --> 07:19.679
It's outside the main staircase.

07:19.681 --> 07:22.282
Nathan James will cruise in
a basket 30 miles off-shore

07:22.284 --> 07:24.250
while Vulture Team helos up the coast,

07:24.252 --> 07:26.719
fast-exits 4 klicks
from Giorgio's place.

07:26.721 --> 07:28.795
- Hostiles?
- Intel from Captain Chandler

07:28.798 --> 07:30.658
suggests that we'll
engage security elements.

07:30.659 --> 07:32.124
It's nothing we haven't seen before.

07:32.127 --> 07:34.460
Once we're inside,
Vulture Team demo-breaches

07:34.462 --> 07:36.696
the map room door, which
is steel-reinforced.

07:36.698 --> 07:38.031
We'll be sure to knock.

07:38.033 --> 07:39.565
What exactly are we looking for?

07:39.567 --> 07:42.268
Anything and everything,
paper or electronic.

07:42.270 --> 07:44.630
Bring back every last asset
you can get your hands on.

07:44.631 --> 07:46.339
If we're lucky,
something inside that room

07:46.341 --> 07:48.059
will tell us where to find Vellek's lab.

07:48.062 --> 07:49.328
Check.

07:52.609 --> 07:54.909
Captain on deck.

07:57.683 --> 07:59.618
Sasha...

07:59.621 --> 08:01.654
- I don't need a speech.
- I'm not making one.

08:01.656 --> 08:07.093
Look, you don't know what
happened with Fletcher.

08:07.095 --> 08:08.861
But you know who you are.

08:08.863 --> 08:11.230
I just wanna make sure you
don't doubt yourself out there.

08:11.232 --> 08:13.633
Never do. Only thing Fletcher taught me

08:13.635 --> 08:15.875
is that I have terrible taste in men.

08:17.105 --> 08:19.271
Alert 60. Get the bird on deck.

08:19.274 --> 08:21.077
Pre-flight in 20.

08:25.465 --> 08:27.674
Do we know how he intends
to deliver the cure?

08:27.677 --> 08:29.577
Should our people expect treated seeds,

08:29.580 --> 08:31.302
remedied plants, or aerosol?

08:31.305 --> 08:33.799
There, I'm afraid, the
Doctor's been rather vague.

08:33.801 --> 08:35.433
We're in contact with his daughter

08:35.436 --> 08:36.865
and we'll push for answers.

08:36.868 --> 08:39.770
When the time is right, we'll
send for the cure and for you.

08:39.774 --> 08:41.374
Understood.

08:41.376 --> 08:43.878
Fletch, we won't forget your courage.

08:43.881 --> 08:47.146
Schoolchildren will
be singing your name.

08:47.148 --> 08:49.548
Kind of you to say, Control,

08:49.550 --> 08:51.684
but I suspect that won't be the case.

08:51.686 --> 08:54.219
It's not that you don't deserve it.

08:54.221 --> 08:58.324
This will be our last direct
communication. Stay safe.

09:12.561 --> 09:15.540
Is this... are we about to eat?

09:15.543 --> 09:16.942
Food borne of the seeds?

09:16.944 --> 09:19.278
I'm raid not, Demetrius. Not yet.

09:19.281 --> 09:21.047
I've only just begun my work.

09:21.050 --> 09:23.551
My son and I are
testing the compound now.

09:23.554 --> 09:24.997
Your son Giorgio?

09:25.000 --> 09:26.852
Yes, Father, where is Giorgio?

09:26.854 --> 09:29.985
Giorgio? Giorgio? Hell, no, not Giorgio.

09:29.986 --> 09:32.925
Giorgio knows as much
about computational biology

09:32.927 --> 09:34.994
as a pigeon knows poker.

09:34.996 --> 09:37.924
I refer to my younger son, Christos.

09:37.927 --> 09:40.199
- He should be here now.
- Dad...

09:44.171 --> 09:46.839
Lucia has a problem with
my younger son's behavior.

09:46.841 --> 09:50.309
No, I have a problem with your
behavior when you're around him.

09:58.085 --> 10:00.552
The compound, Dr. Vellek.

10:00.554 --> 10:02.788
- Are you sure it's going to work?
- Yes, it's going to work.

10:02.790 --> 10:04.990
Of course it's going to
work, just as I promised.

10:04.992 --> 10:07.459
We made great progress thanks
to our friend Mr. Fletcher here.

10:07.461 --> 10:09.361
You mean thanks to me.

10:09.363 --> 10:12.998
Is there a problem, Admiral?

10:13.000 --> 10:16.535
Your father made
arrangements with the British

10:16.537 --> 10:19.038
without first consulting the Greeks,

10:19.040 --> 10:20.639
who backed him from the start.

10:20.641 --> 10:22.975
So yes, there is a problem.

10:26.700 --> 10:28.877
What about the product, Dr. Vellek?

10:28.880 --> 10:32.776
How many more nations are you
intending to share it with?

10:32.779 --> 10:34.779
Is Greece no longer special?

10:34.790 --> 10:38.424
Whatever your arrangement,
Sir, I can assure you,

10:38.426 --> 10:40.625
Britain has no dispute
with you or your people.

10:40.627 --> 10:42.290
Our agreement is with Dr. Vellek

10:42.293 --> 10:44.897
I am the head of the
Hellenic City-State,

10:44.899 --> 10:47.066
and I didn't become this because of some

10:47.068 --> 10:48.567
apocalyptic stroke of luck.

10:48.569 --> 10:50.084
I put men in graves.

10:50.087 --> 10:52.654
I'm everything bad that ever
happened to you, in the flesh.

10:52.657 --> 10:55.498
And Dr. Vellek works for me.

11:01.882 --> 11:04.483
As long as Greece supports your research

11:04.485 --> 11:06.885
and guarantees your security,

11:06.887 --> 11:13.125
everything you do here belongs
to Athens, and Athens only.

11:13.127 --> 11:15.728
You should be happy, Demetrius.

11:15.730 --> 11:18.130
You no longer have any rival in Europe.

11:18.132 --> 11:21.934
- And Britain is an ally.
- I don't want allies!

11:21.936 --> 11:24.361
I want the cure!

11:24.364 --> 11:27.532
Nothing's changed.

11:31.933 --> 11:35.034
A promise is a promise.

11:35.037 --> 11:38.650
Yes, we've formed some new alliances,

11:38.652 --> 11:41.801
and our relationship with Greece,

11:41.804 --> 11:45.105
and with you, dear Demetrius,

11:45.108 --> 11:47.175
is our first priority.

11:47.178 --> 11:49.679
And we still have big
plans, you and I, Demetrius.

11:49.682 --> 11:51.181
Let's not forget that.

11:51.184 --> 11:53.131
So come on, let's celebrate.

11:53.134 --> 11:56.369
We've cooked up your
favorite... Dolmathes Avgolemono.

11:56.372 --> 12:00.064
Dolmathes Avgolemono,
Demetrius. Sit, sit.

12:03.212 --> 12:06.947
Thank you.

12:06.949 --> 12:09.450
Your kitchen does you proud, Dr. Vellek.

12:09.452 --> 12:11.452
It's my mother's recipe.

12:11.454 --> 12:14.421
You might want to soak
it up with some bread.

12:17.392 --> 12:18.897
Eviva!

12:20.963 --> 12:23.197
Eviva.

12:36.142 --> 12:39.603
_

13:01.904 --> 13:03.470
You guys hearing that?

13:03.472 --> 13:05.355
Yeah. Is that...

13:05.358 --> 13:06.940
It's techno, Sir.

13:34.804 --> 13:37.404
Bikinis, booze. Yep, it's a party.

13:37.406 --> 13:40.841
You gotta be kidding
me. We weren't invited?

13:40.843 --> 13:42.810
Giorgio.

13:42.812 --> 13:46.146
Nathan James, be advised.
We have ourselves a wrinkle.

13:46.148 --> 13:48.115
Giorgio's having a house party. Over.

13:48.117 --> 13:49.783
Did he just say house party?

13:49.785 --> 13:51.819
That changes things just a bit.

13:51.821 --> 13:53.987
Yeah, well, that music
alone could kill us.

13:53.989 --> 13:56.757
We got civvies in there now.
If Giorgio's men start blasting,

13:56.759 --> 13:58.304
we're gonna have some casualties.

13:58.307 --> 13:59.993
All right, we do this quiet.

13:59.995 --> 14:02.930
If Giorgio's in there,
he's now primary target.

14:02.932 --> 14:04.898
The key to that room's around his neck.

14:04.900 --> 14:06.900
Burk, Miller, Wolf, set security.

14:06.902 --> 14:09.837
Sasha, Azima, you're with me. Green...

14:09.839 --> 14:13.173
we need to isolate Giorgio.

14:13.175 --> 14:16.176
Ladies, thank you for coming.

14:16.178 --> 14:18.779
He's here, all right.
He's the life of the party.

14:18.781 --> 14:21.415
It won't be easy to get
him away from the pool, Sir.

14:21.417 --> 14:23.584
I may have a way.

14:34.396 --> 14:36.196
Ah, well...

14:36.198 --> 14:40.367
This is not quite how I
imagined this in my dreams.

14:44.540 --> 14:46.874
I lick salt off you yet?

15:10.199 --> 15:13.400
I'm not gonna lie. I thought
I was the finest thing here.

15:16.081 --> 15:17.706
_

15:23.412 --> 15:25.813
I know.

15:28.317 --> 15:30.217
Come on.

15:30.219 --> 15:33.320
Let me show you my house.

15:33.322 --> 15:36.456
I got a great house.

15:48.895 --> 15:53.941
I've not seen such nice
things since before the virus.

15:53.944 --> 15:56.945
This is nothing compared
to what I'm gonna have.

15:56.947 --> 16:00.783
My family are visionaries,
doing remarkable things.

16:00.785 --> 16:03.452
World-changing things.

16:03.454 --> 16:06.255
You ever do it on
2,000-count Egyptian cotton?

16:06.257 --> 16:08.357
That your best line, lover boy?

16:14.682 --> 16:16.932
This couldn't have
waited till I was done?

16:16.934 --> 16:19.134
We didn't have 30 seconds.

16:20.271 --> 16:22.771
Nathan James, this is Vulture Team.

16:22.773 --> 16:24.873
We have Giorgio Vellek in custody. Over.

16:24.875 --> 16:28.644
Copy that, Vulture Team.
Can't wait to see him.

16:35.052 --> 16:36.277
All clear.

16:36.280 --> 16:39.088
Honestly, fellas, the violence.

16:39.090 --> 16:41.709
I thought I was supposed
to be the bad guy.

16:41.712 --> 16:43.558
Move it.

16:54.939 --> 16:57.630
We're in.

17:01.645 --> 17:03.078
Ah!

17:03.080 --> 17:05.914
Wow. You like it rough, huh?

17:12.323 --> 17:13.922
Your father...

17:13.924 --> 17:15.522
where is he?

17:15.526 --> 17:17.626
And I'm just supposed to tell you?

17:17.628 --> 17:20.494
Your playboy days are over, Giorgio.

17:20.498 --> 17:22.797
You get to decide just how uncomfortable

17:22.800 --> 17:24.867
you want it to get going forward.

17:24.869 --> 17:27.249
I don't know what you
people are looking for,

17:27.251 --> 17:30.118
but I'd be prepared to fail.

17:30.120 --> 17:32.487
Seems like you're always
prepared to fail, Giorgio.

17:32.489 --> 17:34.036
I've got something.

17:39.563 --> 17:41.730
Wait.

17:47.304 --> 17:49.104
You were saying?

17:49.106 --> 17:51.072
Nathan James, prepare
to receive data transfer

17:51.074 --> 17:52.153
via Link 16.

17:52.154 --> 17:54.821
Copy, Vulture Team. Monitoring for data.

17:54.824 --> 17:57.444
Chief Rain, stand by to receive.

17:57.447 --> 18:00.282
Aye, aye, Ma'am.

18:03.387 --> 18:08.323
That's my father's work
you're messing with!

18:09.860 --> 18:13.395
I promise you, you will
not get away with this.

18:13.397 --> 18:15.564
Who's gonna stop me? Hmm?

18:15.566 --> 18:18.833
You gonna kill me,
like you killed Moose?

18:18.835 --> 18:20.599
Like you killed Alex?

18:20.600 --> 18:23.137
Oh, right, like I'm the barbarian.

18:23.140 --> 18:26.741
Did you tell your friends how
you nearly beat a man to death

18:26.743 --> 18:30.512
with your bare hands, like an animal?

18:33.083 --> 18:34.195
That's right.

18:34.196 --> 18:37.251
The poor guy was down, beaten,

18:37.254 --> 18:40.922
and your hero here showed him no mercy.

18:40.924 --> 18:43.291
He didn't tell you?

18:43.293 --> 18:45.660
Ohh.

18:45.662 --> 18:48.263
Got demons much?

18:48.265 --> 18:51.700
I wonder what else lurks
in that black heart.

18:52.669 --> 18:54.502
"Hercules."

18:54.504 --> 18:57.272
Sending.

18:58.475 --> 18:59.908
Captain.

19:06.520 --> 19:08.983
_

19:08.986 --> 19:12.287
You were using us, the fighters.

19:12.289 --> 19:15.991
Why? What were you after?

19:15.993 --> 19:18.827
Science.

19:20.497 --> 19:21.963
Science.

19:21.965 --> 19:24.266
What, you didn't think

19:24.268 --> 19:26.768
I pulled you off that
pathetic little island

19:26.770 --> 19:30.171
just so we could
become friends, did you?

19:30.173 --> 19:34.693
You were a guinea pig, a nobody.

19:34.696 --> 19:39.666
And now my father is gonna
tear you limb from limb

19:39.669 --> 19:43.084
for what you did to me...

19:43.086 --> 19:45.420
and what you did to my sister.

20:22.693 --> 20:25.360
Captain, we've got a problem.

20:53.990 --> 20:56.324
Oh, shit. That's Omar.

20:56.326 --> 20:59.761
He's alive. How the hell is he alive?

20:59.763 --> 21:02.464
Just isn't your day, is it, Giorgio?

21:04.568 --> 21:07.469
Oh. Oh, God. Oh, God.

21:07.471 --> 21:09.184
Nathan James, this is Vulture Team.

21:09.185 --> 21:12.243
Target is burned. Omar and his
men have breached the premises.

21:12.246 --> 21:13.258
Omar.

21:13.261 --> 21:14.943
Bogies don't know we're in the house.

21:14.945 --> 21:16.611
Won't be long till they find out.

21:16.613 --> 21:19.178
Requesting immediate hot
extract at primary LZ, over.

21:19.181 --> 21:20.949
Roger, Vulture Team.

21:25.922 --> 21:29.491
What kind of party is this...

21:29.493 --> 21:31.493
with no host?

21:36.639 --> 21:40.735
I know you can hear me, Giorgio!

21:40.737 --> 21:44.205
And I know you can see.

21:44.207 --> 21:48.243
So I'm going to show your friends

21:48.245 --> 21:51.079
what kind of coward you are,

21:51.081 --> 21:54.416
how you are willing to
sacrifice their lives

21:54.418 --> 21:56.818
to protect your own,

21:56.820 --> 21:59.254
because you are the sort of man

21:59.256 --> 22:02.557
who will shoot an ally in the back

22:02.559 --> 22:07.362
and leave him to die.

22:07.364 --> 22:09.697
Show yourself!

22:17.974 --> 22:19.774
Just as I thought.

22:19.776 --> 22:21.876
Mm.

22:23.837 --> 22:25.270
_

22:27.602 --> 22:29.098
_

22:29.340 --> 22:30.641
_

22:31.161 --> 22:32.184
_

22:54.177 --> 22:56.344
If the rest of you want to live,

22:56.346 --> 22:59.314
you will point to where Giorgio is...

23:05.772 --> 23:07.205
_

23:08.792 --> 23:10.492
Omar's men are coming.

23:10.494 --> 23:12.427
We need to hurry with that upload.

23:12.429 --> 23:15.463
- Hurrying as fast as I can.
- No, no, no, no, no.

23:15.465 --> 23:17.966
Green, how long can
you hold off Omar's men?

23:17.968 --> 23:19.544
Four, maybe five mikes.

23:19.547 --> 23:21.135
He's making his way in here,

23:21.137 --> 23:23.171
and then he's gonna cut
off all of our heads!

23:23.173 --> 23:24.939
You should have paid Omar the $20 mil

23:24.941 --> 23:26.773
while you had the chance, Giorgio.

23:39.038 --> 23:41.638
- Mean anything to you?
- Ciphertext, Sir.

23:41.640 --> 23:43.307
Assuming we get the full upload,

23:43.309 --> 23:45.760
asymmetric encryption like this
could take days to decipher.

23:45.763 --> 23:48.645
Sir, I need as many
LAN and ADP support PCs

23:48.647 --> 23:49.980
in Comms as possible.

23:49.982 --> 23:52.216
Anything not tied to ship integrity.

23:52.218 --> 23:53.948
Get her done.

23:53.951 --> 23:55.385
Yes, Sir.

24:11.971 --> 24:14.037
- Upload?
- 70%.

24:16.642 --> 24:17.908
Engage at the door.

24:28.280 --> 24:29.987
_

24:34.260 --> 24:35.893
Send it.

24:45.271 --> 24:48.472
You're right, Giorgio.
You could have killed me.

24:48.474 --> 24:49.840
But now I'm your only hope.

24:49.842 --> 24:52.109
Give us the location
of your father's lab.

24:52.111 --> 24:55.312
Don't, and I'll feed you to Omar.

24:55.314 --> 24:57.814
Just FYI, Omar will skin you alive.

24:57.816 --> 25:00.017
I've seen him do it.

25:00.019 --> 25:02.553
Hey. Hey! I am an asset.

25:02.555 --> 25:04.087
You have to protect me.

25:04.089 --> 25:07.394
And by law, you can't
barter with a terrorist.

25:07.397 --> 25:09.793
So ha! Hoist on your own petard.

25:09.795 --> 25:11.395
- Can we shut him up?
- Shh!

25:13.132 --> 25:14.598
You think I'm an idiot?

25:14.600 --> 25:16.433
You trying to play me
like you played my sister?

25:16.435 --> 25:18.461
Well, guess what? You got played.

25:18.464 --> 25:21.391
She never even liked you.
And your boy Fletcher?

25:21.394 --> 25:24.341
He was happy to bring me those seeds.

25:24.343 --> 25:26.743
There's nothing you can do... Uhh!

25:26.745 --> 25:28.579
Say his name again.

25:29.815 --> 25:31.248
Say his name again.

25:31.250 --> 25:33.550
You gonna let her kill me, Cappy?

25:33.552 --> 25:37.721
You need me to bust this
whole thing wide open.

25:37.723 --> 25:41.792
Sasha, we need him alive.

25:41.794 --> 25:43.126
For now.

25:43.128 --> 25:45.028
Yeah, Sasha.

25:54.206 --> 25:55.206
Aah!

26:01.914 --> 26:03.413
Uhh!

26:14.793 --> 26:17.269
Vulture Team, we're
pinned down, Captain!

26:17.272 --> 26:20.464
We're gonna need all
the help that we can get!

26:20.466 --> 26:21.965
Don't you move.

26:21.968 --> 26:24.048
It's not for me. Huh?

26:24.051 --> 26:28.038
It's for you to use against Omar.

26:28.040 --> 26:30.707
Stay put.

26:38.884 --> 26:40.584
Americans!

26:40.586 --> 26:44.187
I only want Giorgio
and what is owed to me!

26:44.189 --> 26:46.723
I have no quarrel with you!

26:46.725 --> 26:48.191
Oh, we got quarrel with you!

26:48.193 --> 26:50.494
We got mad quarrel with you, you son...

26:55.616 --> 26:57.825
Done. Time to move.

26:57.828 --> 27:00.871
Cobra Team, on me. I
got a surprise for Omar.

27:07.246 --> 27:09.212
Vulture Team, there's too many of 'em.

27:09.214 --> 27:11.754
- We're gonna need to turn and burn.
- Covering Burk and Green.

27:11.755 --> 27:13.650
We cannot take primary to your location.

27:13.652 --> 27:15.919
Using alternate route.

27:41.013 --> 27:44.147
Let's go, go! We got coverage inside!

27:48.220 --> 27:49.720
Clear! Fall back!

27:55.027 --> 27:56.460
- Arm it.
- Got it.

27:56.462 --> 27:58.862
How the hell are we getting out of here?

27:58.864 --> 28:00.964
Is that Caligula?

28:00.966 --> 28:03.033
It was a gift.

28:11.243 --> 28:13.844
Coming out!

28:29.962 --> 28:31.661
Come and get it, Omar!

28:31.663 --> 28:34.264
This here's a gift
from the Burk Brothers!

28:44.843 --> 28:46.810
Aah!

28:46.812 --> 28:48.011
Uhh!

28:48.013 --> 28:49.513
Giorgio, no!

28:57.586 --> 28:58.955
_

29:20.450 --> 29:23.417
- Hey.
- Hey.

29:23.419 --> 29:25.152
This the data from the house?

29:25.154 --> 29:26.554
Yeah.

29:26.556 --> 29:28.516
I've got 15 servers burning through

29:28.517 --> 29:30.825
a million alphanumeric
combinations per second,

29:30.827 --> 29:32.827
looking for a key.

29:32.829 --> 29:34.562
Sounds nerdy.

29:34.564 --> 29:37.632
It's not fast enough.

29:37.634 --> 29:40.334
Mission went great, by
the way. Not a hitch.

29:40.336 --> 29:42.336
Thanks for asking.

29:44.274 --> 29:46.274
Shoulder's great, by the way.

29:46.276 --> 29:48.042
Thanks for asking.

29:54.284 --> 29:57.169
Recce team's combed half the
island looking for Giorgio.

29:57.170 --> 29:58.786
Nothing. Probably died in the blast.

29:58.788 --> 30:00.454
Sir, ledgers you saw in the mansion,

30:00.456 --> 30:02.423
they're medical charts, basically.

30:02.425 --> 30:05.927
A complete record of the
fighters' clinical data.

30:05.929 --> 30:10.298
Diagnostics, progress notes,
problems, test results.

30:10.300 --> 30:12.466
Vellek wasn't just
recording their vitals.

30:12.475 --> 30:14.713
He was also keeping
tabs on his own metrics.

30:14.716 --> 30:16.537
Aggression levels.

30:16.539 --> 30:18.865
The fights weren't just
about entertainment.

30:18.868 --> 30:20.334
Vellek was using them to find

30:20.337 --> 30:22.510
the most aggressive men
he could get his hands on.

30:22.512 --> 30:25.990
There you are. Hercules.
Aggression level nine.

30:25.991 --> 30:27.722
I thought you got off the ship to relax.

30:27.725 --> 30:29.317
That is me relaxed.

30:29.319 --> 30:31.819
Why's Vellek so
interested in aggression?

30:31.821 --> 30:32.912
Here.

30:32.915 --> 30:34.693
I've got something.

30:34.696 --> 30:37.758
A.D. 65... the Roman
philosopher Seneca, a stoic,

30:37.760 --> 30:40.127
wrote a letter to Luciluis
regarding, no doubt,

30:40.129 --> 30:41.829
the notorious emperor Nero

30:41.831 --> 30:43.831
around the time that guy went nuts.

30:43.834 --> 30:48.008
In this letter, Seneca
called anger a short madness,

30:48.011 --> 30:51.672
much like "a falling rock
that breaks itself to pieces

30:51.674 --> 30:53.774
upon the very thing it crushes."

30:53.776 --> 30:56.644
I disagree. It is not a short madness.

30:56.646 --> 30:58.446
Aggression cannot be conquered.

30:58.448 --> 30:59.814
Aggression cannot be beaten

30:59.816 --> 31:01.882
neither by compassion, reason, or love.

31:01.884 --> 31:04.557
Nero did not get better.
He did not get nice.

31:04.560 --> 31:07.823
In fact, in his fury, he
ordered Seneca to kill himself.

31:07.824 --> 31:09.724
Once you go over the cliff, man,

31:09.726 --> 31:11.926
it is a straight shot down.

31:11.928 --> 31:15.629
The rock of anger only
breaks once it breaks you.

31:22.638 --> 31:25.506
This is Ares, God of War.

31:25.508 --> 31:27.936
Aggression levels off the charts, man,

31:27.939 --> 31:30.077
as you can see.

31:38.621 --> 31:40.688
And here is Ares today.

31:45.294 --> 31:47.728
On your feet, fighter man.

31:59.509 --> 32:00.908
Okay.

32:00.910 --> 32:02.671
Enough.

32:06.049 --> 32:08.716
Look at Ares now.

32:08.718 --> 32:10.951
The picture of perfect inner peace.

32:10.953 --> 32:12.887
Propensity of violence...

32:12.889 --> 32:15.423
snuffed out of him, you might say.

32:15.425 --> 32:17.099
Okay, boys, come on in.

32:22.355 --> 32:25.821
You see, I've injected
Ares and his palooka pals

32:25.824 --> 32:27.368
with a concentrate

32:27.370 --> 32:30.271
of an ingredient from
Dinostos Phosphate.

32:30.273 --> 32:33.140
In its purified form, this
chemical short-circuits

32:33.142 --> 32:36.444
the stress/aggression
positive feedback loop,

32:36.446 --> 32:39.981
thus cutting off the
hypothalamic attack response.

32:39.984 --> 32:42.084
Even the most pissed-off individual

32:42.087 --> 32:44.618
is left with a sort
of pleasant pacifism.

32:44.620 --> 32:47.254
I remember that pleasant pacifism.

32:47.256 --> 32:48.589
It was awful.

32:48.591 --> 32:51.092
Sir, what you drank was diluted Nostos.

32:51.094 --> 32:53.094
It's why you were able to recover.

32:53.096 --> 32:55.362
In all other areas, these
fighters are functioning men,

32:55.364 --> 32:57.765
but their will to fight,
their need to fight,

32:57.767 --> 33:01.335
their compulsion to
fight has been overridden

33:01.337 --> 33:03.737
by a kind of docility

33:03.739 --> 33:07.208
the world could use more of right now.

33:07.210 --> 33:09.677
Since Homo Sapien walked out of a cave,

33:09.679 --> 33:12.546
the only reason for man's existence

33:12.548 --> 33:15.116
is to perceive a suffering world

33:15.118 --> 33:19.386
onive a goodness the only
reason that will mend it.

33:19.388 --> 33:21.355
Peace.

33:24.727 --> 33:26.861
This goddamn hippie.

33:26.863 --> 33:29.673
"The kind of docility the world
can use more of right now"?

33:29.676 --> 33:32.399
I mean, It's like Vellek wants
to turn people into livestock.

33:32.401 --> 33:35.269
Sheep. That's the word he used.

33:35.271 --> 33:37.705
He's gonna be the shepherd.

33:37.707 --> 33:39.974
What's all this gotta do with the seeds?

33:39.976 --> 33:41.442
Control.

33:41.444 --> 33:44.078
The seeds give Vellek control
over the world's food supply.

33:44.080 --> 33:46.881
The drug is the weapon
he'll use to protect himself

33:46.883 --> 33:50.986
against any adversary who
tries to take him on... man.

33:52.021 --> 33:53.754
They'll give up without a fight,

33:53.756 --> 33:56.590
do whatever he says in order to get fed.

33:56.592 --> 33:58.792
Jesus.

33:58.794 --> 34:02.496
"Hence we will not say that
Greeks fight like heroes,

34:02.498 --> 34:05.799
but that heroes fight like Greeks."

34:05.801 --> 34:09.254
That was Winston Churchill, man. Wow.

34:10.940 --> 34:12.806
I wonder what that old bulldog

34:12.808 --> 34:15.376
would think of you right now, Demetrius,

34:15.378 --> 34:17.444
You see, Churchill hated war.

34:17.446 --> 34:21.282
I think he'd be proud to see
the fight in you retreating.

34:21.284 --> 34:24.436
Something's wrong
with me. I can feel it.

34:24.437 --> 34:25.652
Can you now?

34:25.655 --> 34:27.221
Well, I've switched off

34:27.223 --> 34:29.590
a single primal compulsion
in you, Demetrius.

34:29.592 --> 34:33.159
An ugly one. I've freed you, man.

34:34.830 --> 34:37.710
I must go home to my
people, Doctor. They need me.

34:37.713 --> 34:41.130
No, no, no, no, no, no, Admiral.
You're staying with me now.

34:41.134 --> 34:43.467
You, Sir, are proof of concept.

34:43.471 --> 34:47.174
The inaugural man... Homo Pacificus.

34:47.176 --> 34:51.679
And judging by the result,
I'd say we're onto something.

34:51.681 --> 34:53.147
Stand up.

34:53.257 --> 34:54.815
Stand up.

34:54.817 --> 34:57.651
Take off your medals.
You're no longer in charge.

34:57.653 --> 34:59.286
Take 'em off. Take 'em off.

35:01.924 --> 35:04.822
Stavros will be taking
your rank, your title,

35:04.825 --> 35:06.239
and your nation.

35:06.242 --> 35:08.910
It all belongs to him now and to me.

35:10.677 --> 35:15.135
As Dante, an Italian, said
about Aristotle, a Greek,

35:15.137 --> 35:20.606
I am "Il maestro dicolor che sanno."

35:25.548 --> 35:28.115
"The master...

35:28.117 --> 35:31.585
of all who know."

35:31.587 --> 35:35.589
What do you think about that, Demetrius?

35:35.591 --> 35:38.014
I... I...

35:38.017 --> 35:40.628
Down, Demetrius.

35:40.630 --> 35:42.129
Sit down.

35:46.957 --> 35:49.272
Finish your food.

36:25.264 --> 36:28.299
You've been at this for hours.

36:28.301 --> 36:30.201
You should eat while
there's still food to eat.

36:30.203 --> 36:32.436
You can give my portion away.

36:35.541 --> 36:37.908
There's no way Fletcher
knew what Vellek was up to,

36:37.910 --> 36:40.344
or he wouldn't have done what he did.

36:40.346 --> 36:43.113
What difference does it make?

36:43.115 --> 36:46.650
He betrayed all of
us. We all trusted him.

36:46.652 --> 36:49.920
No. He betrayed me.

36:49.922 --> 36:52.323
And then I lost control

36:52.325 --> 36:54.158
and nearly blew Giorgio's head off.

36:54.160 --> 36:56.794
- But you didn't.
- Yeah, and what if I had?

36:56.796 --> 36:58.500
What if I had killed him? Then what?

37:00.636 --> 37:02.936
Should I walk off the ship like you did?

37:02.939 --> 37:07.071
Until some other shitty thing
happens that drags me back?

37:07.073 --> 37:10.774
Please, share some of
your hard-won wisdom.

37:15.915 --> 37:18.215
I deserved that.

37:22.740 --> 37:26.174
No. You didn't.

37:28.144 --> 37:31.211
I just...

37:32.481 --> 37:36.150
I don't know what to believe in anymore.

37:36.152 --> 37:38.118
This?

37:38.120 --> 37:41.055
This is all that I have to hang on to.

37:41.057 --> 37:43.157
But if we can find Vellek's lab,

37:43.159 --> 37:44.892
we can get the rest of his research,

37:44.894 --> 37:46.293
and I... and I'm sure of it...

37:46.295 --> 37:50.230
we can still make the
crops we need before...

37:56.939 --> 37:59.907
Before I left,

37:59.909 --> 38:02.242
you told me...

38:02.244 --> 38:04.545
whatever's broken, we can fix it.

38:04.547 --> 38:07.948
And you were right.

38:09.485 --> 38:14.655
You were right then,
and you're right now.

38:23.499 --> 38:26.433
Ma'am? We got a key.

38:30.539 --> 38:33.040
This is Vellek's entire operation.

38:33.042 --> 38:34.441
Click on "Lab."

38:35.544 --> 38:38.412
Open most recent.

38:38.414 --> 38:40.948
- Oh, my God.
- Save that.

38:45.154 --> 38:48.055
You let Tom Chandler get
his hands on information

38:48.057 --> 38:50.157
that would lead him directly to me!

38:50.159 --> 38:52.126
- To me!
- Dad, please...

38:52.128 --> 38:53.560
- Shut up!
- I almost died.

38:55.297 --> 38:58.666
Here I am, in the midst
of testing and perfecting

38:58.668 --> 39:02.002
the perfect recipe of
recipes, the cure of cures,

39:02.004 --> 39:06.040
only to be brought once
again to a screeching halt

39:06.042 --> 39:08.876
by Giorgio Vellek,
the single problem that

39:08.878 --> 39:13.309
with all the gifts endowed
me I cannot seem to solve.

39:16.152 --> 39:17.798
What am I to do?

39:20.923 --> 39:22.442
What am I to do?

39:22.443 --> 39:25.425
Dad, just leave him alone.

39:25.428 --> 39:27.394
We need to focus.

39:27.396 --> 39:30.064
The Americans are on
their way here right now.

39:31.200 --> 39:33.734
All the data they stole is encrypted.

39:33.736 --> 39:35.874
Chandler will break the code.

39:37.440 --> 39:39.043
I need Christos.

39:42.912 --> 39:47.247
- Dad...
- I want my boy! Where is my son?!

39:50.771 --> 39:53.808
I'll go get him... Dad.

40:35.231 --> 40:37.068
I need some air.

40:52.448 --> 40:56.316
We were able to decrypt the
data from Giorgio's house.

40:56.318 --> 40:58.152
The numbers from the mansion,

40:58.154 --> 40:59.787
they show the location of the lab.

40:59.789 --> 41:01.922
They're lat and longs, Sirs.

41:01.924 --> 41:03.423
But there's something else.

41:03.425 --> 41:05.692
The numbers, they're all different,

41:05.694 --> 41:08.729
so we assumed Vellek's people
changed the code each time.

41:08.731 --> 41:10.464
But it wasn't the code that changed.

41:10.466 --> 41:12.332
If the code didn't change,

41:12.334 --> 41:14.268
that means the location of the lab did.

41:15.471 --> 41:17.204
Coordinates aren't on land.

41:17.206 --> 41:19.438
No. Vellek's lab...

41:22.144 --> 41:24.678
it's a ship.
