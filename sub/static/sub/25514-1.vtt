03:42.370 --> 03:43.586
How you doing, part'?

03:46.657 --> 03:47.746
It's good to see you.

04:34.468 --> 04:36.770
What the hell
are you doing here?

04:36.772 --> 04:39.329
You're supposed to be
up there in the hospital.

04:39.331 --> 04:42.179
I seen Tanner at the bar,
he said you escaped, huh?

04:42.181 --> 04:43.939
Told you to check me out.

04:43.941 --> 04:46.179
Well, doctor said you're
supposed to stay up there.

04:47.236 --> 04:48.225
Give me a hug.

04:48.227 --> 04:49.859
Why don't you go inside
and sober up?

04:49.861 --> 04:52.964
Sober up?
Let me see you rope that.

04:54.852 --> 04:57.509
Checking yourself out of the
hospital like your Uncle Roddy?

04:59.812 --> 05:01.027
What the hell?

05:01.029 --> 05:02.564
Can't you rope anymore?

05:05.477 --> 05:06.533
Got any chew?

05:18.853 --> 05:19.845
Just give me a hug.

05:20.869 --> 05:21.829
Love you.

06:09.191 --> 06:10.277
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

06:10.279 --> 06:11.493
<i>how about another round
of applause?</i>

06:11.495 --> 06:12.836
<i>You get a little bit
out of time,</i>

06:12.838 --> 06:15.269
<i>and that's all it takes
to put you down on the ground.</i>

06:15.271 --> 06:18.726
<i>Next in the livestock bucking
chute, here's Brady Jandreau.</i>

06:36.200 --> 06:37.509
<i>Bucking chute.</i>

06:37.511 --> 06:39.143
<i>Here comes Brady.</i>

06:39.145 --> 06:41.158
<i>Go, Brady. Go, Brady!</i>

07:02.857 --> 07:04.904
<i>Go, Brady!</i>

07:12.489 --> 07:14.279
<i>Well, folks, it's...</i>

07:14.281 --> 07:17.481
<i>Our rear pickup can't get a hold
of that horse. The cowboy...</i>

07:29.545 --> 07:30.505
Hmm.

07:32.489 --> 07:33.768
There's supper.

07:33.770 --> 07:35.560
Better have a bite
of that chuckwagon.

07:35.562 --> 07:37.001
Just look at it
for a second.

07:37.897 --> 07:38.983
Mmm-mmm.

07:38.985 --> 07:41.384
I'm sick of it.
It makes me all mad.

07:41.386 --> 07:43.239
- I'll make a deal with you.
- Hmm?

07:43.241 --> 07:45.387
A bite of the chuckwagon

07:45.802 --> 07:47.495
or wear a bra.

07:47.497 --> 07:49.320
But I don't like
that bra ever!

07:49.322 --> 07:51.240
Brady,
get her that bra.

07:51.242 --> 07:52.840
You shouldn't try to force her
to eat things

07:52.842 --> 07:54.153
she doesn't want to eat.

07:54.155 --> 07:56.488
But I just want to eat
fruit or not

07:56.490 --> 08:00.040
or respect about your
favorite thing to do or not.

08:00.042 --> 08:01.803
You're as stubborn
as your brother.

08:02.538 --> 08:04.073
Look how he ended up.

08:04.075 --> 08:06.280
- That's dirty.
- Big old gash on the side of his head.

08:06.282 --> 08:09.928
I told him not to go over there and
ride that son of a bitch anyway.

08:09.930 --> 08:12.458
Well, I would have won the rodeo
if I would've got her rode.

08:13.643 --> 08:14.954
Excuse me, guys.

08:14.956 --> 08:17.132
Whole point of it is,
is I told you to stay home.

08:18.667 --> 08:20.363
I had a bad feeling
the whole time.

09:06.316 --> 09:08.204
You got him
backing up pretty good?

09:08.973 --> 09:10.027
How you doing, Frank?

09:10.029 --> 09:11.531
Hey, Brady. How you doing?

09:11.533 --> 09:13.035
Shit, I'm healing up.

09:13.037 --> 09:15.499
- It looks pretty wicked there.
- Yeah.

09:15.501 --> 09:16.970
I'll be good to go
before long.

09:16.972 --> 09:18.826
Bullshit. Don't let him
lie to you, Frank.

09:18.828 --> 09:20.043
Fuck that.

09:20.045 --> 09:21.709
I'll come and see you, Frank.
Don't worry about it.

09:22.893 --> 09:24.907
You should lay off that
horse's face a little bit,

09:24.909 --> 09:27.467
and he wouldn't be putting his
head in there like a goose.

09:27.469 --> 09:29.868
Well, you can tell me
what to do

09:29.870 --> 09:31.915
when you're riding
the son of a bitch.

09:31.917 --> 09:33.900
Too bad you went to the rodeo
and got all fucked up

09:33.902 --> 09:34.924
and you ain't showing him.

09:34.926 --> 09:37.036
I was doing
what I needed to do.

09:37.038 --> 09:38.924
Well, I'm doing
what I need to do.

09:38.926 --> 09:41.773
Finishing something
that you should be doing.

09:50.222 --> 09:52.207
Well, see you, Brady.
Take care.

10:28.815 --> 10:29.935
I was tough, Mom.

11:45.202 --> 11:46.928
What's the matter,
Brady?

11:46.930 --> 11:48.146
Sit down, Lilly.

11:49.650 --> 11:51.185
- You okay?
- Sure.

11:51.187 --> 11:53.424
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

11:53.426 --> 11:54.387
All right.

11:55.474 --> 11:57.296
You won't get hurt yourself.

11:57.298 --> 11:58.512
I didn't mean to.

11:58.514 --> 12:00.370
Aw, it's okay.
Come here.

12:01.171 --> 12:02.643
- Listen.
- What?

12:03.282 --> 12:06.035
This time, you don't...

12:06.515 --> 12:07.857
Your hurt boo-boo?

12:07.859 --> 12:09.235
- Yeah.
- I...

12:09.875 --> 12:11.249
That... This is a head.

12:11.251 --> 12:12.913
- Yeah.
- It's called "skull."

12:12.915 --> 12:14.225
Yeah, I hurt my skull.

12:14.227 --> 12:16.496
- You know what they had to do?
- What?

12:16.498 --> 12:17.938
They had to do surgery.

12:17.940 --> 12:20.240
Surgery? Don't joke me.

12:20.242 --> 12:22.353
You know what they do
when they do surgery?

12:22.355 --> 12:24.179
- What?
- What do they do?

12:25.172 --> 12:26.674
- Got broke.
- Yeah.

12:26.676 --> 12:28.434
I broke it.
Broke my skull.

12:28.436 --> 12:29.841
Yeah, "broke my skull,"
right.

12:29.843 --> 12:32.882
And then you have
to cut it with a knife.

12:32.884 --> 12:33.938
Uh-huh.

12:33.940 --> 12:35.154
- Cut it.
- Yeah.

12:35.156 --> 12:37.969
- And then they put a plate in there.
- Uh-huh.

12:37.971 --> 12:39.443
And then they sewed it up.

12:40.181 --> 12:42.674
But you said...

12:42.676 --> 12:44.469
- "Not gonna, either"?
- Not gonna what?

12:45.300 --> 12:47.668
Bucking horse anymore.

12:48.532 --> 12:49.782
Uh, maybe.

12:50.389 --> 12:53.010
Oh, dear, that's terrible.

12:53.012 --> 12:54.323
I'm not gonna die.

12:54.325 --> 12:56.595
- No, I'm not gonna die, either.
- No.

12:56.597 --> 12:58.932
- I'm staying alive.
- Yeah.

13:00.500 --> 13:02.674
Lil, can you sing me a song
so I can take a nap?

13:02.676 --> 13:04.627
- Yes.
- Okay.

13:44.343 --> 13:45.717
Holy piss.

13:47.159 --> 13:49.301
Jesus Christ,
he looks like Frankenstein.

13:49.303 --> 13:50.901
That's fucking right.

13:50.903 --> 13:53.589
Fuck that.
That's just a scratch.

13:54.870 --> 13:56.404
Some smoke will help it.

13:58.615 --> 14:00.084
Get the fuck out of here.

14:01.687 --> 14:03.669
You can wrap it up, right?

14:03.671 --> 14:05.013
Why?
What are you guys doing?

14:05.015 --> 14:06.357
Put your Wranglers on, man.

14:06.359 --> 14:09.238
- Yeah, let's go get fucked up, bud.
- Let's go.

14:09.240 --> 14:10.901
Last of the Mohics.

14:22.648 --> 14:24.277
Yeah!

14:28.376 --> 14:29.941
Your turn, James. Do it.

14:29.943 --> 14:30.903
Yee!

14:32.792 --> 14:33.879
Yeah!

14:34.839 --> 14:35.863
Fuck yeah, dude.

14:39.608 --> 14:40.758
Come on, Brady!

14:40.760 --> 14:41.976
Let's go!

14:42.488 --> 14:43.928
Come on, Brady!

14:48.344 --> 14:49.817
- Brades, come on!
- Yeah.

14:54.200 --> 14:56.343
That horse I got on
in Fargo was...

14:56.345 --> 14:57.847
Everything I heard
about her was shit,

14:57.849 --> 15:01.526
but I got on her
and said, "Fuck it," and...

15:01.528 --> 15:04.374
She was good out there
for a while, and...

15:04.376 --> 15:06.104
Until the whistle,
she got real trashy

15:06.106 --> 15:08.855
and started turning there
by the fence, sucking back,

15:08.857 --> 15:10.745
and I went over
the front of her.

15:11.802 --> 15:13.495
She stepped on my head,
popped me out.

15:13.497 --> 15:16.600
Didn't knock me out until they got
me back to the hospital there.

15:16.602 --> 15:17.913
I had a seizure

15:19.257 --> 15:21.431
and went into a coma.

15:21.433 --> 15:25.305
Yeah, I been going
for 10-plus years, you know?

15:25.307 --> 15:27.320
Probably had
10-plus concussions.

15:27.322 --> 15:30.231
I probably should...
I mean, by NFL standards,

15:30.233 --> 15:31.834
I should be dead,
you know what I mean?

15:32.730 --> 15:35.928
Got kicked in Kadoka
at Rodeo Bible Camp.

15:35.930 --> 15:38.777
Went out the back door.
That wasn't so bad.

15:38.779 --> 15:41.592
It was kind of a stinger there
for about a week, but...

15:41.594 --> 15:44.024
Started riding and it
loosened up a little more.

15:44.026 --> 15:45.591
Got on this big,
gray mare.

15:45.593 --> 15:48.442
I was getting pretty stretched
out towards the end,

15:48.444 --> 15:50.203
and thank God
I heard the whistle blow.

15:51.035 --> 15:53.272
But, anyway, right at the end,

15:53.274 --> 15:55.065
she slammed me down
in the dirt.

15:55.067 --> 15:58.200
Hardest I've ever been
slammed before.

15:58.202 --> 16:01.818
Brady over there told me
to get on my short-go horse

16:01.820 --> 16:04.345
even though my ribs hurt
like a son of a bitch.

16:04.347 --> 16:06.234
Ain't that right, Brady?

16:06.236 --> 16:08.954
You don't let no pain
put you down.

16:08.956 --> 16:10.969
You ain't gonna be turning out
horses left and right

16:10.971 --> 16:13.050
just 'cause your head hurts
a little bit now, are you?

16:13.052 --> 16:15.194
I'm not... I'm not drawing out
of anything.

16:15.196 --> 16:17.273
I'm just taking some time off.

16:17.275 --> 16:19.481
Your brain's a little
different than your ribs.

16:19.483 --> 16:22.044
Yeah, I know, but it's all
the same to a cowboy.

16:22.715 --> 16:24.123
Ride through the pain.

16:28.027 --> 16:31.900
You gotta make sure this head
of yours don't get you scared.

16:33.213 --> 16:35.450
I know how that goes
with some guys.

16:35.452 --> 16:36.986
They get scared
to get on again,

16:36.988 --> 16:38.746
and then they
end up becoming farmers.

16:38.748 --> 16:40.060
Hey, Brady.

16:41.308 --> 16:42.267
You seen Lane?

16:43.676 --> 16:45.145
Well, I didn't get a chance

16:45.147 --> 16:48.090
to see him there for a while,
while I was rodeoing.

16:48.092 --> 16:51.866
They just checked him into a
brand-new rehab facility.

16:51.868 --> 16:55.770
He probably could have won the World
if he'd had an honest chance.

16:55.772 --> 16:59.963
Remember when he went three for three
in McCool Junction and won it?

16:59.965 --> 17:02.235
Yeah, that was a good night
for Lane.

17:02.237 --> 17:04.347
Remember when he
broke his riding arm

17:04.348 --> 17:06.521
and won the bull riding
first time ever

17:06.523 --> 17:09.339
riding a bull with his right hand?
Eighty-four points.

17:09.340 --> 17:12.059
Shit, one time, me and Lane
was coming back from a party.

17:12.060 --> 17:14.781
We was driving
in Tanner's brother's car,

17:15.646 --> 17:17.050
and we was kind of
talking about women.

17:17.053 --> 17:19.579
We was a little drunk,
and Lane looks over at me

17:19.582 --> 17:20.604
and says,
"James, you know what?

17:20.606 --> 17:22.140
"One thing
I've learned in life,"

17:22.142 --> 17:23.387
he says...

17:23.390 --> 17:25.212
"I've always thought girls
come in with a name

17:25.214 --> 17:27.451
"and they leave
with a number."

17:28.766 --> 17:30.238
It's kind of
fucked up, but...

17:31.134 --> 17:33.182
- Dirty dog.
- Yeah. Lane.

17:34.078 --> 17:35.038
Yeah.

17:35.454 --> 17:36.606
Real wild.

17:39.422 --> 17:40.988
Want to say
a prayer for him.

17:40.990 --> 17:44.636
I mean, be best if we say a
prayer every day, you know...

17:44.638 --> 17:45.660
Yeah.

17:45.662 --> 17:47.167
For the guy,
'cause he sure could use it.

17:48.159 --> 17:50.111
But I just want to
go ahead and say...

17:51.839 --> 17:55.901
Pray to God that
he takes in all the strength

17:55.903 --> 17:58.239
from all his friends
across the nation.

17:59.326 --> 18:01.148
North, south, east and west.

18:01.150 --> 18:03.934
'Cause we all know he's got
friends all over this country.

18:05.343 --> 18:06.718
Pulls through.

18:07.615 --> 18:09.504
Hope he gets to ride again.

18:10.911 --> 18:12.192
Feel the wind

18:13.984 --> 18:15.200
hit his back

18:16.350 --> 18:18.144
and watch it flow
through the grass.

18:20.832 --> 18:22.880
We are him, and he is us.

18:24.833 --> 18:26.720
We're all
one in this together.

Get over here.

23:00.362 --> 23:02.183
Should have left
them mares alone

23:02.185 --> 23:04.041
and quit rubbing your nose
on the fence.

23:07.689 --> 23:09.160
Wouldn't have to be
sitting here.

23:13.161 --> 23:14.281
Come on, Gus.

23:25.962 --> 23:28.008
- Hello, ma'am.
- Hi.

23:28.010 --> 23:29.673
I'm here to see Lane Scott.

23:37.387 --> 23:39.274
Hey, brother. How you doing?

23:43.946 --> 23:45.738
Long time, no see, brother.

23:48.075 --> 23:49.387
I missed you.

23:52.779 --> 23:54.475
Feeling better?
You're looking good.

23:56.395 --> 23:58.282
Looks like they're doing
a lot for you here.

24:03.018 --> 24:04.203
How you feeling?

24:06.411 --> 24:08.747
Feeling good, huh?
It's a pretty good place here.

24:09.163 --> 24:10.316
H...

24:11.083 --> 24:12.236
O...

S.

24:16.427 --> 24:17.388
How's...

24:18.860 --> 24:20.396
How's my head?

24:24.139 --> 24:25.259
Feeling all right.

24:26.349 --> 24:27.500
B...

24:29.835 --> 24:30.796
S.

24:32.876 --> 24:35.469
Oh, "Rub some..."

24:39.499 --> 24:40.524
D.

24:41.997 --> 24:43.658
"Rub some dirt in it"?

24:44.941 --> 24:46.732
Little bit of Copenhagen,
too, huh?

24:48.972 --> 24:50.475
<i>Name's Lane Scott.</i>

24:50.477 --> 24:54.411
<i>I'm 18 years old, and I'm
from Kennebec, South Dakota.</i>

24:54.413 --> 24:57.451
<i>Lane, he's young,
but he's really good.</i>

24:57.453 --> 24:59.533
<i>Best bull rider to come out
of South Dakota, for sure.</i>

25:00.237 --> 25:02.220
<i>I mean... I mean,</i>

25:02.222 --> 25:05.515
<i>I'm not... Not trying to imply
anything, but me and Superman have</i>

25:05.517 --> 25:07.724
<i>never been seen in the
same room together, so...</i>

25:19.853 --> 25:21.389
<i>No shirt. Wild man.</i>

25:26.797 --> 25:28.303
<i>Nice, baby!</i>

25:29.614 --> 25:31.181
<i>Good ride, cowboy!</i>

25:31.183 --> 25:33.101
<i>I was about three years old</i>

25:33.103 --> 25:35.692
<i>when my dad introduced me
into the rodeo world.</i>

25:35.694 --> 25:37.164
<i>There's nothing
that really can beat it.</i>

25:37.166 --> 25:39.757
<i>You get on a bull,
make a good ride, everybody...</i>

25:39.759 --> 25:41.836
<i>Everybody in the stands
stands up for you,</i>

25:41.838 --> 25:42.926
<i>yells, cheers. Um...</i>

25:43.790 --> 25:45.388
<i>Your adrenaline's going,
you...</i>

25:45.390 --> 25:47.341
<i>You just can't stop
but smiling.</i>

25:47.343 --> 25:48.684
<i>There's nothing
like strapping yourself</i>

25:48.686 --> 25:51.725
<i>onto a 2,000 pound animal
and just going with it.</i>

25:51.727 --> 25:52.941
<i>That's what I wanted to do,</i>

25:52.943 --> 25:54.636
<i>and I knew I wanted to do it
for the rest of my life.</i>

25:54.638 --> 25:56.430
<i>I couldn't imagine
doing anything else.</i>

26:15.856 --> 26:19.501
<i>♪ Somebody come

<i>♪ Somebody come

26:23.151 --> 26:25.005
- Lil.
- What?

26:25.007 --> 26:26.734
Thinking about going
to the rodeo.

26:26.736 --> 26:28.112
If I do, you want to go with?

26:29.328 --> 26:30.512
Nope.

26:31.856 --> 26:32.781
Nope.

26:32.783 --> 26:35.374
Take you to
the carnival afterwards.

26:35.376 --> 26:37.487
- Carnival?
- Get on some rides.

26:38.416 --> 26:39.662
Are you sure?

26:39.664 --> 26:41.486
- If you want to.
- Yes.

26:41.488 --> 26:43.566
<i>♪ Somebody come

26:57.777 --> 26:58.801

27:49.683 --> 27:52.658
Go! Go! Go! Go!

27:52.660 --> 27:56.497

27:56.499 --> 27:58.097
<i>He's got

27:58.099 --> 28:00.337

<i>He's safe on the ground.</i>

28:22.196 --> 28:24.372
<i>Let's hear it for Tanner!</i>

28:38.708 --> 28:41.267
Holy piss, did you see
that gray horse buck today?

28:41.269 --> 28:42.643
With Cameron, right?

28:42.645 --> 28:43.955
Yeah. Saddle horse.

28:43.957 --> 28:45.395
- Really?
- Yeah.

28:45.397 --> 28:47.731
Hey. Wake up, Grandpa.

28:47.733 --> 28:49.908
Falling asleep over there.

28:49.910 --> 28:52.724
You entering Water's Rodeo
on the 17th?

28:52.726 --> 28:54.164
- 17th?
- Yeah.

28:55.125 --> 28:56.754
Should be ready to roll
by then.

28:56.756 --> 28:59.315
Yeah, man, it'll be good to see
you back out there, scratching 'em.

28:59.317 --> 29:00.339
Come on, now, Tanner.

29:00.341 --> 29:01.428
What's wrong with that?

29:01.430 --> 29:02.707
He has a metal plate
in his head.

29:02.709 --> 29:05.012
So? Metal's strong.
It's supposed to not break.

29:05.014 --> 29:07.571
He'll be fine.
He's not a little bitch.

29:07.573 --> 29:08.790
You know what? Fuck you.

29:10.038 --> 29:12.917
Yeah, fuck you, Brady.
It's dangerous.

29:15.831 --> 29:17.429
Hey, don't worry
about it, man.

29:18.678 --> 29:20.116
Howdy.

29:20.118 --> 29:22.068
- Are you Brady Blackburn?
- Yeah.

29:22.070 --> 29:24.212
- Bill.
- Bill, it's good to meet you.

29:24.214 --> 29:26.708
I heard you're
a great horse trainer.

29:26.710 --> 29:27.764
Sesame Street?

29:27.766 --> 29:29.044
I have a colt
that nobody can break.

29:29.046 --> 29:30.804
I'm 15, silly.

29:30.806 --> 29:32.340
Would you come
and look at him?

29:32.342 --> 29:34.036
Tell me what you think?

29:34.038 --> 29:36.533
I caved my head in riding a
bucking horse not too long ago.

29:36.535 --> 29:38.453
I got some
healing up to do right now.

29:38.455 --> 29:40.052
- Lil, are you thirsty?
- What?

29:40.054 --> 29:41.654
- Nah.
- And...

29:41.656 --> 29:43.061
Here in a couple weeks, I'll
probably be able to come and...

29:43.063 --> 29:44.309
- Come on, Lil.
- No way!

29:44.311 --> 29:45.429
- Right here, right here. Come on.
- No way.

29:45.431 --> 29:46.868
- No!
- It's just one sip.

29:46.870 --> 29:48.596
It's way better for you
than that. Come on.

29:48.598 --> 29:50.005
The fuck you think
you're doing with her?

29:50.007 --> 29:51.285
What the fuck, man?
What do you want?

29:51.287 --> 29:52.725
- Hey, hey, hey, hey...
- Fuck you!

29:52.727 --> 29:55.317
- Calm down, man. Calm down.
- Get the hell out of here.

29:55.319 --> 29:56.629
Tanner didn't mean
nothing by it.

29:56.631 --> 29:58.103
Just being friendly.
That's all.

29:59.576 --> 30:00.821
Fuck, man.

30:00.823 --> 30:02.712
We all love Lilly.
You know that.

30:09.368 --> 30:10.552
Okay.

30:14.519 --> 30:17.016
- Lil, are you all right?
- I'm okay.

30:27.737 --> 30:29.208
This is what you need
right now.

30:41.049 --> 30:42.806
Hey, everybody.

30:42.808 --> 30:45.559
Look at the moon
and the stars.

30:45.561 --> 30:47.898
And the planets!

30:48.984 --> 30:50.040
Wow.

30:52.601 --> 30:56.151
<i>♪ Planets, moon and stars</i>

30:56.153 --> 30:59.577
<i>♪ Above the world so high</i>

The problem with you boys,

31:20.538 --> 31:22.713
you don't like to get
your pride hurt.

31:24.122 --> 31:27.993

<i>♪ Earth is what we know... ♪</i>

31:33.434 --> 31:37.496
Lilly used to get all mad
whenever we were in the store

31:37.498 --> 31:40.858
and she didn't get
what she wanted, and...

31:41.531 --> 31:43.097
She'd throw a fit.

31:43.099 --> 31:45.721
You know,
and be mad about it.

31:45.723 --> 31:48.985
I don't know, she's just
not like that anymore.

31:48.987 --> 31:52.474
She's got all these new things
that she does and likes,

31:53.434 --> 31:54.618
and saying...

31:56.891 --> 31:58.395
She's growing up so fast.

31:59.292 --> 32:00.924
You get to be around more.

32:04.572 --> 32:06.492
No more rodeo for you.

32:32.956 --> 32:34.557
Here I go!

32:41.308 --> 32:42.364
Hey, Miles.

32:44.062 --> 32:45.373
How's it going, guys?

32:48.862 --> 32:50.205
I'm looking
for your dad.

32:51.133 --> 32:53.307
He owes me some money
on this trailer.

32:53.309 --> 32:54.460
Need payment.

32:54.462 --> 32:56.794
Otherwise,
I'm gonna come and get it.

32:56.796 --> 32:59.707
He went to the horse sale
in Corsica yesterday,

32:59.709 --> 33:02.076
and I haven't seen him
since he left, but...

33:02.078 --> 33:05.372
Yeah, it's been four months
since I got any money from him.

33:05.374 --> 33:06.494
I need some.

33:07.870 --> 33:09.788
I'm tired of looking
for his ass.

33:09.790 --> 33:11.004
Okay. I'll be sure
to let him know.

33:11.006 --> 33:12.734
Yeah, he needs
to come and find me.

33:13.374 --> 33:14.590
I'm done.

33:16.605 --> 33:18.142
I like your tattoos.

33:29.150 --> 33:31.390
- Do you have a resume?
- No.

33:33.727 --> 33:35.230
Any job experience?

33:36.158 --> 33:37.278
I'm a horse trainer.

33:39.391 --> 33:41.405
You can't do that
right now?

33:41.407 --> 33:44.829
Um... Well, I would,
but I can't ride for a while

33:44.831 --> 33:46.400
since I'm laid up, so...

33:47.998 --> 33:49.695
Any high school? GED?

33:50.367 --> 33:51.455
No, ma'am.

33:53.119 --> 33:56.573
The OST TERO office,
they have job training

33:56.575 --> 33:59.069
for, like, construction,
road work.

33:59.071 --> 34:01.822
I'm looking for something a
little more temporary than that.

34:01.824 --> 34:03.390
You know,
I'm probably gonna

34:03.392 --> 34:05.150
be training horses again
here in a few months

34:05.152 --> 34:06.751
when I'm healed up, so...

34:10.367 --> 34:12.926
My cousin's a manager
at Dakotamart.

34:12.928 --> 34:15.934
They have some
temporary positions.

34:15.936 --> 34:18.206
You can call him
and tell him I sent you.

34:18.208 --> 34:19.168
Okay.

34:19.744 --> 34:20.928
Thank you.

34:23.648 --> 34:25.056
You look like your mom.

34:26.465 --> 34:29.697
I used to go to high school with her.
She was really awesome.

35:05.441 --> 35:07.648
Wow, Brady.
What are you doing here?

35:07.650 --> 35:08.832
How you doing, Victor?

35:08.834 --> 35:10.624
Good. How about yourself?

35:10.626 --> 35:12.448
All right.

35:12.450 --> 35:14.881
- So you work here now?
- Yeah.

35:14.883 --> 35:17.952
Guy's gotta do what he's
gotta do, I guess, huh?

35:17.954 --> 35:20.385
I don't know.
It's none of my business,

35:20.387 --> 35:21.984
but when you start getting
comfortable, you know,

35:21.986 --> 35:25.920
you need to get back to them
horses and rodeos and stuff.

35:25.922 --> 35:27.233
Yeah.

35:27.235 --> 35:29.025
Just not making enough money.

35:29.027 --> 35:30.402
You know what I mean?

35:32.547 --> 35:33.569
Thanks, Victor.

35:33.571 --> 35:34.819
Hey, don't give up.

35:41.282 --> 35:44.194
Hey, I stopped by
the Family Dollar.

35:44.196 --> 35:45.313
Got you a surprise.

35:45.315 --> 35:47.329
- Me?
- Yeah.

35:47.331 --> 35:49.187
Boy, I don't think so.

35:50.083 --> 35:52.194
You don't think so?
Why in the hell not?

35:52.196 --> 35:53.923
You want to go
to that rodeo with me?

35:54.435 --> 35:55.489
You gotta wear that.

35:55.491 --> 35:56.802
- Nuh-uh.
- It's a public place. Yep.

35:56.804 --> 35:58.049
- You're in high school now, Lil.
- Nuh-uh!

35:58.051 --> 35:59.586
- You can wear a bra.
- But I don't like it anymore.

35:59.588 --> 36:02.306
- Come on, you're 15 years old.
- But I don't like it, my daddy.

36:02.308 --> 36:05.154
- Why?
- Because it's not fair.

36:05.156 --> 36:06.401
Why wouldn't it be fair?

36:06.403 --> 36:08.738
Because it doesn't like
15 anymore.

36:08.740 --> 36:10.721
But I just want
a 14-years-old.

36:10.723 --> 36:13.122
Well, you can't
do a 14 no more, dear.

36:13.124 --> 36:15.268
But yes, you will!

36:21.156 --> 36:22.243
Hey, Lil.

36:23.203 --> 36:25.121
- What are you doing, Lil?
- I'm doing good.

36:25.123 --> 36:29.476
<i>Hey, I don't like to wear a bra anymore.
It's all yucky.</i>

36:30.308 --> 36:31.779
Oh, good.

36:31.781 --> 36:34.050
You know Daddy's just trying
to watch out for you, right?

36:34.052 --> 36:35.363
Yeah.

36:35.365 --> 36:38.371
I sure better tell him, "Watch
out the revolving door."

36:38.373 --> 36:39.939
He should've just greased it.

36:39.941 --> 36:42.885
The children are
all over the world, is a...

36:43.364 --> 36:44.738
Is...

36:44.740 --> 36:46.948
You don't want to do something,
you're just not gonna do it?

36:46.950 --> 36:48.483
No.

36:48.485 --> 36:49.508
You're stubborn, just like
your big brother, aren't you?

36:49.510 --> 36:52.485
Yeah, whatever,
but I don't like it.

37:10.023 --> 37:12.548
I just don't know
about you horse traders.

37:12.550 --> 37:14.116
- Hey, Todd.
- Yep.

37:14.118 --> 37:16.293
- How you doing, Brady?
- Pretty good. Yourself?

37:16.295 --> 37:17.924
Good. How's your head doing?

37:17.926 --> 37:19.014
Oh, I'm healing up.

37:19.494 --> 37:21.924
That's good. Good.

37:21.926 --> 37:25.860
Hey, Todd, I haven't talked
to Brady yet about this so...

37:25.862 --> 37:27.652
So can you just come back
tomorrow and pick him up?

37:27.654 --> 37:28.740
Yeah, I can.

37:28.742 --> 37:29.829
Catch you later, Brady.

37:29.831 --> 37:31.366
- I'll see you.
- See you.

37:36.230 --> 37:37.382
What was that all about?

37:44.519 --> 37:45.863
What was Todd doing here?

37:48.295 --> 37:49.862
Had to sell him Gus, Brady.

37:52.328 --> 37:53.990
Sell him Gus? What do
you mean, sell him Gus?

37:53.992 --> 37:55.173
You can't sell Gus.

37:55.175 --> 37:57.188
You want 'em
to haul the trailer away?

37:57.190 --> 37:59.365
You want Lilly to not have
a place to live?

37:59.367 --> 38:00.934
Gus is part of the family.

38:00.936 --> 38:02.917
I guess it's his turn
for us to make a living.

38:02.919 --> 38:04.518
Well, where's all
your money going?

38:04.520 --> 38:06.310
It costs a lot to live.

38:06.312 --> 38:08.166
Well, maybe you should've thought about
that when you were putting money

38:08.168 --> 38:10.950
in the slot machines, going to
the fucking bars and casinos.

38:10.952 --> 38:12.326
That's where
all the money went.

38:12.328 --> 38:14.054
Fuck you, Brady. I don't
need to hear your shit.

38:14.056 --> 38:16.169
It's not like you
can fucking ride anymore.

38:21.577 --> 38:22.984
What are you gonna do?
Fight me?

38:24.680 --> 38:25.992
I don't need your shit.

39:22.091 --> 39:23.658
My dad sold Gus today.

39:24.682 --> 39:25.835
Damn. Really?

39:27.627 --> 39:29.131
Yeah. Todd bought him.

39:30.378 --> 39:32.172
Well, at least he's going
to a good home.

39:34.218 --> 39:36.683
I wish I could ride him
one last time, though.

39:41.419 --> 39:42.890
Looks really nice,
Brady.

39:43.659 --> 39:44.652
Thanks.

39:45.226 --> 39:46.508
Who is it of?

39:47.915 --> 39:49.802
My buddy, Lane.

39:49.804 --> 39:52.137
- You know him?
- Mmm-mmm.

39:52.139 --> 39:55.081
Yeah, he was
a pretty good bull rider.

39:55.083 --> 39:56.908
He was like
a big brother to me.

40:00.748 --> 40:04.106
Pretty awesome tribute
for a wild guy, anyway.

40:04.108 --> 40:07.372
Yeah. And a lot of
times, you know, you get hurt,

40:08.780 --> 40:10.956
but you don't ever think
you'll get hurt like that.

40:14.765 --> 40:15.946
He'll get there, though.

40:15.948 --> 40:17.420
He says he's gonna ride again
in no time.

41:24.686 --> 41:27.596
God, I just ask you to take care
of Gus on his travels, Lord.

41:27.598 --> 41:29.676
Just be with him all the time
and protect him.

41:29.678 --> 41:30.895
Keep him safe, God.

41:32.079 --> 41:34.095
In Jesus' name,
I pray. Amen.

44:11.348 --> 44:12.882
This breed I've been...

44:12.884 --> 44:14.833
That I got in this horse here,

44:14.835 --> 44:16.981
he's a thoroughbred, Arabian,

44:17.716 --> 44:19.986
leopard and quarter horse.

44:19.988 --> 44:22.132
I've been trying to
get this breed for years.

44:23.413 --> 44:27.701
Nobody's ever been on his back.
Nobody's touched him.

44:48.374 --> 44:51.347
Whoa, partner.
Whoa, partner.

44:51.349 --> 44:52.727
Good boy.

44:56.438 --> 44:58.516
Easy, partner. Easy, partner.

44:58.518 --> 44:59.510
Easy.

45:02.454 --> 45:04.277
Did you... Did you
learn this on your own,

45:04.279 --> 45:06.419
or did someone teach you?

45:06.421 --> 45:08.276
- My mom and dad.
- Your mom and dad?

45:08.278 --> 45:10.259
Taught me about
everything I know.

45:10.261 --> 45:12.725
But I learned a lot
by being on their back,

45:12.727 --> 45:14.134
looking down them ears.

45:15.478 --> 45:17.717
Whoa, good boy.

45:17.719 --> 45:19.926
You didn't even know
you did that, did you?

45:20.918 --> 45:22.645
Good boy. You just led.

45:26.230 --> 45:28.404
I'm gonna ask you to do that
in a minute, all right?

45:28.406 --> 45:30.231
I'm gonna ask you to do that
in a minute.

45:32.951 --> 45:35.254
Step forward. Step forward.

45:35.672 --> 45:36.693
Step forward.

45:36.695 --> 45:38.389
Wow, look at that.

45:38.391 --> 45:40.309
Whoa, whoa.

45:40.311 --> 45:44.053
I think I'm gonna touch you up there.
I'm gonna touch you up there.

45:44.055 --> 45:46.262
It's okay. It's okay.

45:46.264 --> 45:48.471
It's okay. It's okay.

45:48.888 --> 45:50.104
It's okay.

45:51.480 --> 45:55.096
Good boy. I know. Sorry, I
was too tight on you there.

45:55.799 --> 45:57.207
Just gotta let you trust me.

45:58.648 --> 46:00.119
Gotta quit trying
to force you.

46:01.272 --> 46:02.648
Now, just trust me, brother.

46:03.544 --> 46:05.398
No, no

46:05.400 --> 46:08.054
Stay with me.
Stay with me, now.

46:08.056 --> 46:11.414
Whoa, partner.
Whoa, partner.

46:11.416 --> 46:13.463
All right, I know you're turning
away from your buddies,

46:13.465 --> 46:15.160
and I know you
don't want to do that.

46:16.024 --> 46:17.944
Good boy, Cool Breeze.

46:18.424 --> 46:19.512
Good boy.

46:20.921 --> 46:23.254
Good boy, Cool Breeze.

46:23.256 --> 46:25.240
What I'm teaching
right now is pressure.

46:26.361 --> 46:28.087
There's a good boy.

46:28.089 --> 46:29.175
No. All right.

46:29.177 --> 46:30.423
- Whoa, Cool Breeze.
- Keep going.

46:30.425 --> 46:32.728
One, two, three...

46:33.336 --> 46:35.895
My hat! Whoa, partner.

46:35.897 --> 46:37.657
Yeah, my hat
comes off my head.

46:39.065 --> 46:41.017
See that?
It comes off like that.

46:45.273 --> 46:47.960
His dad
never had no buck.

46:47.962 --> 46:52.857
He just would let us get on, but
he would always keep an eye on us.

46:57.241 --> 46:58.427
Keep going, buddy.

47:01.211 --> 47:02.425
Come on, buddy.

47:02.427 --> 47:04.377
- Stay calm.
- Wow, that's amazing.

47:06.138 --> 47:08.602
A horse that never had nobody
on his back before.

47:11.738 --> 47:13.143
You can tell
he wants to learn.

47:13.145 --> 47:15.611
- Oh, yeah, he's smarter.
- He's real smart.

47:18.874 --> 47:20.153
That's a lot of trust
he has in you.

47:20.155 --> 47:21.498
Yeah.

47:30.107 --> 47:31.801
See how much calmer he is
now that I'm actually on him?

47:31.803 --> 47:33.753
Yeah. Yeah.

47:33.755 --> 47:34.971
He feels me.

47:38.875 --> 47:41.370
Let's get a little
forward. Forward.

47:41.372 --> 47:43.225
You're gonna be
a racehorse someday.

47:43.227 --> 47:44.572
Let's get some forward.

47:45.468 --> 47:46.875
One more time to the right.

47:48.187 --> 47:49.564
And that's all we're doing.

47:51.611 --> 47:52.957
Good boy.

47:53.403 --> 47:55.066
Excellent job.

47:55.068 --> 47:57.916
All right, now, I'm coming
off the same side I came on.

47:58.332 --> 47:59.483
Whoa, partner.

48:00.443 --> 48:02.074
Whoa, partner.

48:02.076 --> 48:04.185
Yeah, I heard
you had that touch.

48:04.187 --> 48:05.820
Now I finally get to see it.

48:08.699 --> 48:09.948
Good boy.

48:17.340 --> 48:18.492
<i>Now 12.</i>

48:19.548 --> 48:20.540
<i>Now 13.</i>

48:21.757 --> 48:23.484
<i>Thirteen...</i>

48:31.710 --> 48:34.140
<i>Fair bid on four, folks.
Have a look.</i>

48:34.142 --> 48:35.387
<i>I'll tell you what,</i>

48:35.389 --> 48:36.570
<i>we're gonna show you something
pretty nice right here.</i>

48:36.572 --> 48:37.498
- Good to see you, Brady.
- Hey, how are you?

48:37.500 --> 48:39.931
<i>Let's go. And a 12, 13...</i>

48:39.933 --> 48:41.787
<i>Here's a pretty
nice-looking horse right here.</i>

48:41.789 --> 48:43.900
<i>Just a 2009 model, guys.</i>

48:43.902 --> 48:46.266
<i>Give me 7,000
on a good deal here.</i>

48:46.268 --> 48:47.483
<i>Got 6,800.</i>

48:47.485 --> 48:48.862
- <i>Give me 7,000.</i>
- Nice horse.

48:49.757 --> 48:51.931
- Definitely.
- <i>Sixty-eight hundred.</i>

48:51.933 --> 48:53.118
<i>Now 7,000.</i>

48:54.109 --> 48:55.422
Hey, Victor, what's up?

48:57.502 --> 49:00.539
Hey, I got a nice
roan gelding for you.

49:00.541 --> 49:02.716
Yeah, Brady and I
will be over soon.

49:02.718 --> 49:04.860
- Hey, Wayne.
- Hey, Greg, how you doing today?

49:04.862 --> 49:06.237
- It's all good.
- How you doing?

49:06.239 --> 49:08.125
Hi. I'm good. How are you?
What would you like?

49:08.127 --> 49:09.983
- I'll have a Crown and water.
- Okay.

49:12.510 --> 49:13.855
Come on, dickhead.

49:14.526 --> 49:15.676
Pay something.

49:15.678 --> 49:17.535
All right.

49:29.439 --> 49:31.038
Aren't you one hell
of a bronc rider?

49:31.711 --> 49:33.470
We don't
talk about that.

49:45.663 --> 49:47.806
- How you doing, man? Good to see you.
- Good, Victor. How you doing?

49:47.808 --> 49:49.757
Pretty good. Pretty good.

49:49.759 --> 49:50.942
Here's his paperwork.

49:50.944 --> 49:52.254
All right.

49:52.256 --> 49:53.534
Pretty good bloodline there.

49:53.536 --> 49:55.647
- Just as you said, isn't it?
- Yep.

49:56.255 --> 49:57.280
Cool.

50:29.120 --> 50:30.593
Easy, bud.

50:32.226 --> 50:35.873
Dang, you sure are a
good-looking sucker, ain't you?

50:36.609 --> 50:38.210
Whoa, buddy.

50:38.657 --> 50:39.904
Whoa.

50:39.906 --> 50:41.279
Whoa, buddy.

50:50.177 --> 50:52.033
Whoa, buddy.

50:54.017 --> 50:56.831
Hey, Brady,
your dad's looking for you.

50:56.833 --> 50:58.272
Who's this?

50:58.274 --> 51:00.096
That's Apollo.

51:00.098 --> 51:01.792
How well is he broke?

51:01.794 --> 51:04.704
Ah, some dumb fuckers came
down and tried to ride him,

51:04.706 --> 51:07.295
but, uh, he got bucked off,
so they quit, you know.

51:07.297 --> 51:10.115
He gots a lot of bad habits now.
He's starting to buck.

51:12.322 --> 51:13.762
It's a shame.

51:15.138 --> 51:17.698
Good horse like this
going to waste.

51:17.700 --> 51:19.746
I'll let him
go for seven.

51:21.666 --> 51:24.322
Yeah, I might have to come
back for him someday.

51:28.963 --> 51:32.130
This right here
is gonna save us.

51:32.132 --> 51:34.240
- Save us all.
- Might cure the meth.

51:34.242 --> 51:37.793
There's gas in here.
There's oil in here.

51:37.795 --> 51:39.361
There's clothes in here.

51:39.363 --> 51:41.251
- Yep.
- There's rope in here.

51:42.019 --> 51:43.618
This is the future, boys.

51:43.620 --> 51:45.602
So, what do you think
about that horse?

51:45.604 --> 51:48.130
What you think you're
gonna want for him? For real.

51:48.132 --> 51:50.018
I want $1,250 cash.

51:50.020 --> 51:52.644
I don't know if I got $1,250,
though, man.

51:54.435 --> 51:56.257
Willing to make a deal?

51:56.259 --> 51:59.906
I need a back windshield
for an '82 Camaro.

51:59.908 --> 52:03.010
What do you say
I throw in that back window

52:03.012 --> 52:05.090
and I got $700?

52:05.092 --> 52:06.178
Seven hundred?

52:06.180 --> 52:07.970
Seven hundred
and this bag of weed.

52:07.972 --> 52:09.635
Dad, we need the cash.

52:09.637 --> 52:11.970
We can take that money and buy
another horse and make some money.

52:11.972 --> 52:13.251
You're always
smoking my weed up.

52:13.253 --> 52:15.587
Just as well trade him
for this little bit of grass.

52:15.589 --> 52:17.732
What do you think?
Don't you like the grass?

52:18.404 --> 52:19.491
Yeah.

52:19.493 --> 52:20.547
All right, let's do it.

52:20.549 --> 52:21.955
All right, we got us
a deal, then?

52:21.957 --> 52:24.293
- Yeah, you're damn right.
- All right, sounds good.

52:28.197 --> 52:29.699
<i>♪ Clean up</i>

52:29.701 --> 52:34.050
<i>♪ Clean up,
everyone is clean up</i>

52:34.052 --> 52:37.347

52:37.349 --> 52:42.118

52:42.661 --> 52:44.229
<i>♪ Clean up ♪</i>

53:13.959 --> 53:15.397
Definitely looks
like you got some...

53:15.399 --> 53:17.924
Some wear and tear on it here.
A little rough there and...

53:17.926 --> 53:21.157
You know, one of these new
would run a guy about $2,300.

53:21.159 --> 53:23.109
- Yeah?
- Custom and everything, so...

53:23.111 --> 53:25.157
Um, general rule of thumb,

53:25.159 --> 53:27.653
pawnshops offer
about a quarter on the dollar,

53:27.655 --> 53:29.957
so, you know, if it...
If it's worth two grand,

53:29.959 --> 53:32.933
maybe $500 just to help you out
since you said you're selling it,

53:32.935 --> 53:34.725
you don't want it back.

53:34.727 --> 53:35.910
- All right.
- Do that?

53:35.912 --> 53:36.966
- Yeah.
- All right, perfect, man.

53:36.968 --> 53:39.078
Let me get
some paperwork going.

53:44.360 --> 53:46.150
You know what?
I see a lot of young cowboys

53:46.152 --> 53:47.621
come in with their saddles.

53:47.623 --> 53:51.047
A lot of 'em get rid of 'em. You
can't be rodeoing forever, right?

53:57.896 --> 54:01.190
Okay, partner, what... What'd
you say your last name was?

54:01.192 --> 54:02.630
You know what, man?

54:02.632 --> 54:04.519
I think I changed my mind.

54:04.521 --> 54:07.271
Okay. Well, I appreciate you
bringing it in.

54:07.273 --> 54:08.873
Yeah. Thank you.

54:14.281 --> 54:16.680
What are you doing
with that bronc saddle?

54:17.193 --> 54:18.502
I was gonna pawn it.

54:18.504 --> 54:20.071
Pawn it for what?

54:20.073 --> 54:23.047
Victor's horse, Apollo.

54:23.049 --> 54:25.353
I think he'd turn out
to be a good one.

54:45.482 --> 54:47.560
Hey, I just got off
the phone with Victor.

54:47.562 --> 54:50.119
He said you can go get Apollo
tomorrow if you want him.

54:50.121 --> 54:53.801
I sold that buckskin
to some people from Arizona.

54:53.803 --> 54:56.585
Told him I'd pay him
when I got the money.

55:01.802 --> 55:03.976
I think I'm gonna go to the bar.

55:03.978 --> 55:05.738
There's pizza
in here for Lilly.

55:16.458 --> 55:17.673
Got a ways to go?

55:17.675 --> 55:19.144
- Yeah.
- All right, man.

55:19.146 --> 55:20.297
Good luck
to the both of you.

55:20.299 --> 55:21.579
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

55:42.252 --> 55:44.875
Whoa, whoa, buddy.

55:45.707 --> 55:48.332
Whoa. Whoa.

55:52.268 --> 55:54.285
It's okay, buddy.
You're okay.

55:55.884 --> 55:59.241
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

55:59.243 --> 56:00.972
Go on, then, you fucker.

56:02.925 --> 56:04.202
Hyah!

56:04.204 --> 56:05.740
Go ahead, fucker!

56:05.997 --> 56:07.178
Ha!

56:34.925 --> 56:36.685
Good job, Apollo.

56:46.478 --> 56:48.173
Hyah, hyah, hyah!

56:50.189 --> 56:51.662
Hyah!

57:12.848 --> 57:15.918
Hyah, hyah, hyah, hyah, hyah!

57:18.990 --> 57:20.527
Yee-haw!

57:29.264 --> 57:31.022
Good boy.

57:31.024 --> 57:32.912
You did a good job.

57:36.560 --> 57:38.287
You're a good boy.

57:40.753 --> 57:41.903
Yeah.

57:48.624 --> 57:49.807
Whoa.

57:52.783 --> 57:54.256
Good boy.

57:54.576 --> 57:56.049
Come on.

57:57.424 --> 57:58.798
Let's go for a cruise.

57:58.800 --> 58:00.720
How does that sound, bud?

58:44.915 --> 58:46.866
- You know, Lil...
- What?

58:48.051 --> 58:50.192
It's hard
not rodeoing anymore.

58:50.194 --> 58:54.643
I know it's hard, but can't
you please more careful?

58:55.635 --> 58:57.744
I know I need
to be more careful.

58:57.746 --> 59:02.575
But it still have
A-through-Z adventure.

59:02.577 --> 59:04.592
At least I can
ride again now.

59:04.594 --> 59:06.002
Train horses.

59:06.259 --> 59:07.089
I know.

59:07.091 --> 59:09.328
We'll seize this time.

59:09.330 --> 59:11.795
I can take in
a whole bunch of colts,

59:12.402 --> 59:14.224
make some money,

59:14.226 --> 59:16.977
and maybe get you all those presents
you want for your birthday.

59:16.979 --> 59:18.065
Really?

59:18.067 --> 59:19.569
Yeah.

59:19.571 --> 59:21.970
Wow, I can't wait
to see this.

59:23.572 --> 59:26.865
Good night, sun.
See you in the morning.

59:28.498 --> 59:32.180
- I'll take care of you, Lil.
- I'll take care of you, too.

59:45.971 --> 59:48.338
Hey, Brady. What the fuck
you doing here?

59:48.340 --> 59:50.899
You still need me
to train those horses for you?

59:50.901 --> 59:52.690
You want another hole
in your head?

59:52.692 --> 59:55.028
Sure. Why not?

01:00:03.573 --> 01:00:06.130
Whoa. Whoa.

01:00:06.132 --> 01:00:07.573
Whoa! Bitch.

01:00:10.324 --> 01:00:11.796
Hey, hey, hey.

01:00:12.564 --> 01:00:14.229
Come on, Crystal.
Get in there.

01:00:14.740 --> 01:00:16.149
Hey!

01:00:35.062 --> 01:00:36.341
Whoa!

01:00:38.613 --> 01:00:39.829
Whoa!

01:00:40.918 --> 01:00:42.387
Whoa!

01:00:42.389 --> 01:00:44.277
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:00:48.726 --> 01:00:50.133
Smell it.

01:01:07.606 --> 01:01:09.143
Whoa.

01:01:22.807 --> 01:01:24.280
Whoa.

01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:38.295
Fuck.

01:01:41.175 --> 01:01:42.681
Whoa, Crystal.

01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:45.079
Whoa, whoa.

01:01:45.592 --> 01:01:46.422
Whoa.

01:01:46.424 --> 01:01:48.310
Whoa, Crystal, whoa.

01:01:48.312 --> 01:01:51.480
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

01:01:54.648 --> 01:01:56.248
Whoa, girl.

01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:10.904
You all right, Brady?

01:02:12.664 --> 01:02:14.039
Yeah, I'm all right.

01:02:14.041 --> 01:02:16.153
Looking pretty wild
over there.

01:02:25.402 --> 01:02:27.096
Come on, Apollo!

01:03:33.180 --> 01:03:35.706
<i>Dr. Nyman,
reception area, please.</i>

01:03:35.708 --> 01:03:37.145
<i>Dr. Nyman.</i>

01:03:59.772 --> 01:04:01.658
What's going on
with your hand

01:04:01.660 --> 01:04:04.635
is called a partial
complex seizure.

01:04:04.637 --> 01:04:08.635
The brain is sending
these signals too fast,

01:04:08.637 --> 01:04:12.602
and your hand can't keep up,
so it just stays clenched.

01:04:12.604 --> 01:04:16.090
And your dad says you haven't
been resting at all?

01:04:16.092 --> 01:04:18.333
- Is that right?
- I told him to rest.

01:04:19.484 --> 01:04:21.277
He never listens, though.

01:04:22.557 --> 01:04:26.492
If you don't stop, your
seizures are gonna get worse.

01:04:26.494 --> 01:04:28.443
And you can't afford
another head injury

01:04:28.445 --> 01:04:30.622
on top of the one
that you have.

01:04:31.614 --> 01:04:33.566
Think about it, okay?

01:04:34.526 --> 01:04:37.278
No more riding,
no more rodeos.

01:05:46.048 --> 01:05:48.481
<i>♪ Most of the time</i>

01:05:49.409 --> 01:05:54.430
<i>♪ I can keep myself distracted</i>

01:05:54.432 --> 01:05:57.057
You know, I'm your dad.
You can talk to me.

01:06:02.849 --> 01:06:05.920
Well, Brades, we have to
play the cards we're dealt.

01:06:06.816 --> 01:06:09.791
Sometimes dreams
aren't meant to be.

01:06:09.793 --> 01:06:14.079
<i>♪ Should've never let you go</i>

01:06:14.081 --> 01:06:15.550
<i>♪ I'm hanging on...</i>

01:06:15.552 --> 01:06:17.985
It's too bad
your mom ain't here.

01:06:18.881 --> 01:06:21.503
You and her could
be stubborn together.

01:06:21.505 --> 01:06:24.671
<i>♪ You still cross my mind</i>

01:06:24.673 --> 01:06:27.265
<i>♪ Cross my heart ♪</i>

01:07:05.730 --> 01:07:08.547
All right, when he goes up in the
air, throw that shoulder back.

01:07:11.363 --> 01:07:13.028
Stay back in your saddle.

01:07:13.475 --> 01:07:14.948
He's gonna kick.

01:07:17.859 --> 01:07:21.218
Like that. Perfect.
Just like that.

01:07:21.220 --> 01:07:23.330
So, then, after that, I...

01:07:23.332 --> 01:07:24.577
- Yeah, just...
- Throw my shoulder back?

01:07:24.579 --> 01:07:25.633
Yeah, to get rid
of that range.

01:07:25.635 --> 01:07:28.449
And then up in the air,
off to your left.

01:07:28.451 --> 01:07:31.649
When he jumps up,
put your shoulder forward.

01:07:31.651 --> 01:07:33.122
Just like that. Perfect.

01:07:33.124 --> 01:07:35.460
Now, let me...
Don't forget to lift across.

01:07:37.091 --> 01:07:38.626
There you go.

01:07:38.628 --> 01:07:40.612
Get your feet involved.

01:07:41.187 --> 01:07:42.435
Saddle.

01:07:42.437 --> 01:07:44.291
There you go.

01:07:44.293 --> 01:07:46.689
Lift on that rein now.

01:07:46.691 --> 01:07:50.882
Ride like it's gonna be the
last horse you ever get on.

01:07:50.884 --> 01:07:53.157
'Cause any bronc
could be the last one.

01:07:53.861 --> 01:07:55.011
There you go.

01:07:55.013 --> 01:07:56.642
All right, let me
feel the jump.

01:07:56.644 --> 01:07:58.370
Go ahead.

01:07:58.372 --> 01:07:59.651
Okay, go ahead.

01:07:59.653 --> 01:08:01.379
Go ahead, jump.

01:08:01.381 --> 01:08:03.010
All right.
About right there, then.

01:08:03.012 --> 01:08:04.101
All right.

01:08:05.540 --> 01:08:06.726
Go ahead.

01:08:14.149 --> 01:08:16.358
See how I go back and across?

01:08:20.357 --> 01:08:22.627
Lift!

01:08:22.630 --> 01:08:24.580
Way out here,
hold him a second.

01:08:24.582 --> 01:08:25.859
Beat him back to the ground.

01:08:25.861 --> 01:08:27.267
Hold him a second.

01:08:27.269 --> 01:08:28.964
Beat him back to the ground.

01:08:28.966 --> 01:08:30.630
Fast feet.

01:08:33.988 --> 01:08:35.683
James, you want to try?

01:08:35.685 --> 01:08:36.902
Yeah.

01:08:37.926 --> 01:08:39.270
All right.

01:08:48.037 --> 01:08:50.086
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:08:58.502 --> 01:09:00.517
This is Lane Scott's
old riding shirt.

01:09:00.519 --> 01:09:01.670
He won about

01:09:02.854 --> 01:09:05.573
$15,000 in one summer
in this shirt.

01:09:05.575 --> 01:09:06.756
Gee.

01:09:06.759 --> 01:09:08.069
Yeah.

01:09:08.071 --> 01:09:09.796
It was mine for a while.

01:09:11.048 --> 01:09:13.765
I probably had
my best summer in it.

01:09:13.767 --> 01:09:15.939
And if it fits you,
you can have it, too.

01:09:15.942 --> 01:09:18.149
But way too short
in the arms for me.

01:09:18.151 --> 01:09:19.877
Damn.

01:09:19.879 --> 01:09:23.526
Some cowboys believe
yellow is superstitious.

01:09:23.528 --> 01:09:25.733
- Yeah.
- That one's lucky, though, huh?

01:09:25.734 --> 01:09:27.398
Yeah, that one
must just be 'stitious.

01:09:27.399 --> 01:09:29.412
Yeah, just
a little 'stitious.

01:09:29.415 --> 01:09:31.014
'Stitious is okay.

01:09:31.015 --> 01:09:33.670
- It's classy and old-school, too.
- Yeah.

01:09:33.671 --> 01:09:35.270
Don't make it look bad.

01:09:39.657 --> 01:09:42.310
Yeah. Try on them chaps, too.
You got any chaps?

01:09:42.312 --> 01:09:43.399
Uh-huh.

01:09:43.401 --> 01:09:45.992
If they fit,
go ahead and take 'em.

01:09:51.176 --> 01:09:52.808
Fit perfect.

01:09:54.057 --> 01:09:55.686
Thanks, Brades.
Appreciate it.

01:09:55.688 --> 01:09:57.766
Yeah.

01:09:57.768 --> 01:09:59.655
Can't wait to ride
in these bad boys.

01:09:59.657 --> 01:10:04.585
<i>This is the reigning
world champion saddle bronc rider!</i>

01:10:05.673 --> 01:10:07.689
James, you still wrestle?

01:10:10.313 --> 01:10:13.799
Sometimes. Haven't practiced
in a while, though.

01:10:13.801 --> 01:10:15.561
Come on, let's wrestle, then.

01:10:17.321 --> 01:10:20.103
- Right now?
- Why not?

01:10:20.105 --> 01:10:23.143
I... I mean, are you sure, Brades?
Is your head okay?

01:10:23.145 --> 01:10:24.297
I'm fine.

01:10:26.313 --> 01:10:28.424
Been a long day, hey.

01:10:28.426 --> 01:10:30.025
Shake it up a bit, huh?

01:10:30.602 --> 01:10:32.106
Come on, James.

01:10:36.266 --> 01:10:38.568
Okay.
All right, let's do it.

01:10:38.570 --> 01:10:40.202
All right,
let's go, then.

01:10:40.938 --> 01:10:42.666
Just watch his noggin.

01:10:44.810 --> 01:10:49.418
<i>In his first appearance
ever, has an excellent round.</i>

01:11:15.723 --> 01:11:17.579
Get that leg out.

01:11:28.107 --> 01:11:30.221
Okay, Brade. Okay.

01:11:31.724 --> 01:11:33.323
Brady, I'm pinned.

01:11:36.492 --> 01:11:38.861
All right, all right,
all right, man.

01:11:39.308 --> 01:11:41.194
Fuck, Brady.

01:11:41.196 --> 01:11:42.636
Fuck, man.

01:11:44.140 --> 01:11:45.868
- You all right?
- Yeah.

01:11:47.501 --> 01:11:49.708
- Didn't hurt you, did I?
- Said I was pinned.

01:11:50.284 --> 01:11:52.491
Told you I was done.

01:11:52.493 --> 01:11:54.573
What's the matter
with you?

01:11:57.484 --> 01:11:59.338
Cowboy up, part'.

01:11:59.340 --> 01:12:03.020
<i>With the highest-marked
run of the National Finals Rodeo.</i>

01:12:17.388 --> 01:12:20.172
You don't think I was
too hard on James, do you?

01:12:20.174 --> 01:12:22.573
No, he's all right.

01:12:26.926 --> 01:12:29.548
You know, I... I know
about your hand.

01:12:29.550 --> 01:12:34.062
I know you ain't supposed to be
rodeoing or anything like that.

01:12:36.717 --> 01:12:37.902
Must be tough.

01:12:40.174 --> 01:12:42.254
But you just
gotta learn to let it go.

01:12:43.502 --> 01:12:44.972
Move on.

01:12:44.974 --> 01:12:46.350
Or else it'll eat at you.

01:12:49.743 --> 01:12:51.950
But it's gotta be tough.
I mean...

01:12:53.487 --> 01:12:55.055
I understand.

01:12:56.367 --> 01:12:58.063
You don't understand.

01:13:08.783 --> 01:13:10.927
"Say I won't,
and I will"?

01:13:12.303 --> 01:13:13.840
Pick up.

01:13:18.191 --> 01:13:20.591
There you go. There's one.

01:13:21.135 --> 01:13:22.576
All right.

01:13:24.079 --> 01:13:25.551
Jesus.

01:13:29.679 --> 01:13:32.112
Looking good,
stud muffin.

01:13:35.664 --> 01:13:37.454
Okay, grab the saddle horn.

01:13:37.456 --> 01:13:38.736
Grab on.

01:13:39.312 --> 01:13:40.494
With this hand.

01:13:40.496 --> 01:13:42.190
Let him... Let him
bend over a little bit.

01:13:42.192 --> 01:13:43.632
Got it.

01:13:44.528 --> 01:13:46.287
Good job. Keep going.

01:13:46.289 --> 01:13:47.695
Get a hold, brother.

01:13:47.697 --> 01:13:49.967
Okay, push through
on this leg hard, Lane.

01:13:49.969 --> 01:13:51.183
You ready?

01:13:51.185 --> 01:13:52.782
- I got him.
- Check.

01:13:52.784 --> 01:13:54.224
Okay, bend this leg, Lane.

01:13:54.226 --> 01:13:56.528
Come around. Come around.

01:13:57.521 --> 01:13:58.831
Lift over.

01:13:58.833 --> 01:14:00.431
Keep going.

01:14:00.433 --> 01:14:02.543
Okay, now, sit down.

01:14:02.545 --> 01:14:03.951
- Sit down.
- Nice.

01:14:03.953 --> 01:14:05.071
Okay, come up.

01:14:05.073 --> 01:14:06.127
Use your arms.

01:14:06.129 --> 01:14:07.375
All the way up, Lane.

01:14:07.377 --> 01:14:09.102
- Good job, buddy.
- All the way up.

01:14:10.130 --> 01:14:11.442
- Good job.
- Nice work.

01:14:15.057 --> 01:14:17.713
Don't wanna get a burn.
Sunburn.

01:14:28.850 --> 01:14:31.889
Whoa, boy. Now, slow
him down a little bit.

01:14:32.241 --> 01:14:33.392
All right.

01:14:33.394 --> 01:14:35.823
Stop him and back him up.

01:14:35.825 --> 01:14:37.328
All right, now,
stick your chest out.

01:14:37.330 --> 01:14:39.024
Sit... Sit up straight.

01:14:39.026 --> 01:14:41.522
Let's go... Let's do
some loping and go fast.

01:14:44.147 --> 01:14:46.834
Really loping off
into the distance, huh?

01:14:55.890 --> 01:14:56.977
You bet.

01:14:56.979 --> 01:14:59.348
All right, wheel him
around to the right.

01:15:01.011 --> 01:15:03.187
Wheel him around
to the left.

01:15:07.571 --> 01:15:08.849
All right, now stop him.

01:15:08.851 --> 01:15:10.480
Ho, boy.

01:15:10.482 --> 01:15:12.084
Let me hear you say "Ho"!

01:15:12.339 --> 01:15:13.617
Ho.

01:15:13.619 --> 01:15:15.120
Good job, Lane.

01:15:15.122 --> 01:15:17.617
All right, now, you better hold on.
She might go to bucking.

01:15:17.619 --> 01:15:20.083
Better if you can keep
a good tight seat in there.

01:15:23.091 --> 01:15:24.627
Grab a hold of
that saddle horn, huh?

01:15:27.475 --> 01:15:29.521
Bobbing her head.
You better lift on your rein.

01:15:29.523 --> 01:15:31.506
Lift, lift, lift,

01:15:31.508 --> 01:15:33.332
lift, lift.

01:15:34.676 --> 01:15:36.725
Lift, lift.

01:15:38.484 --> 01:15:40.340
You got her pulled up now.

01:15:51.061 --> 01:15:52.532
Sit up, Lane.

01:15:53.141 --> 01:15:55.092
Sit up and look at me now.

01:15:57.077 --> 01:15:58.997

01:16:00.917 --> 01:16:02.837

01:16:10.421 --> 01:16:11.861

01:16:16.437 --> 01:16:18.070
There you go.

01:16:21.910 --> 01:16:23.380
All right, brother.

01:16:23.382 --> 01:16:24.981
Well...

01:16:24.983 --> 01:16:27.125
It was really good
seeing you.

01:16:39.670 --> 01:16:41.973
All right, brother.

01:16:41.975 --> 01:16:44.918
Sit up for me.
Look at me now, brother.

01:16:45.686 --> 01:16:47.508
Look at me.

01:16:47.510 --> 01:16:48.789
There you go.

01:16:48.791 --> 01:16:50.230
Big and tall.

01:16:51.126 --> 01:16:52.181
All right, brother.

01:16:52.183 --> 01:16:53.591
See you.

01:16:54.998 --> 01:16:56.309
Give me a hug, now.

01:16:56.311 --> 01:16:59.029
Give me a good one.
Give me a good one.

01:16:59.031 --> 01:17:00.631
There's my man.

01:17:06.903 --> 01:17:08.599
I love you, brother.

01:19:33.692 --> 01:19:35.226
Oh, this is my little brother,

01:19:35.228 --> 01:19:37.082
- What's your name, buddy?
- Adriano.

01:19:37.084 --> 01:19:38.683
- Good to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

01:19:38.685 --> 01:19:40.218
You're gonna be a bronc rider
when you grow up?

01:19:40.220 --> 01:19:41.913
- Yes, sir.
- You betcha.

01:19:41.915 --> 01:19:43.419
Yeah, I think
he wants to take a picture.

01:19:43.421 --> 01:19:44.667
He's been talking
about you all day.

01:19:44.669 --> 01:19:47.226
All right. You...
You riding pony broncs yet?

01:19:47.228 --> 01:19:48.539
Yes, sir.

01:19:48.541 --> 01:19:50.010
You gonna stick it to 'em
when you get older, huh?

01:19:50.012 --> 01:19:51.484
- Yes, sir.
- You bet.

01:19:53.886 --> 01:19:55.867
- All right, thank you.
- Right on.

01:19:55.869 --> 01:19:57.499
So, do you, like, work here?

01:19:57.501 --> 01:20:01.243
Oh, yeah, I'm just trying to stay
busy while I'm healing up, you know.

01:20:01.245 --> 01:20:02.715
Nice.

01:20:02.717 --> 01:20:04.346
- Yeah.
- Hope you get better soon.

01:20:04.348 --> 01:20:05.756
And look forward
to see you ride.

01:20:05.758 --> 01:20:07.034
- Thank you, buddy.
- Yes, sir.

01:20:07.036 --> 01:20:09.084
- Nice to meet you, Brady.
- Yeah. You boys spur 'em high.

01:20:09.086 --> 01:20:10.590
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:21:00.064 --> 01:21:01.694
Apollo!

01:21:10.912 --> 01:21:12.800
Come on, boy!

01:21:54.465 --> 01:21:56.097
Whoa, Apollo.

01:22:00.002 --> 01:22:00.962
Whoa.

01:22:04.673 --> 01:22:06.079
Whoa, Apollo.

01:22:06.081 --> 01:22:07.682
Boy.

01:22:47.458 --> 01:22:49.155
I'm sorry, buddy.

01:23:46.373 --> 01:23:48.259
I'm sorry, Brady.

01:23:48.261 --> 01:23:50.500
This is all there is to do.

01:23:50.502 --> 01:23:53.604
Whistle for him
when you walk away, please.

01:25:09.928 --> 01:25:11.589
<i>You know, Lilly,</i>

01:25:11.591 --> 01:25:13.445
Apollo got hurt,

01:25:13.447 --> 01:25:15.462
and we had to put him down.

01:25:15.464 --> 01:25:16.776
Nope.

01:25:17.095 --> 01:25:18.504
Nuh-uh.

01:25:20.040 --> 01:25:22.758
<i>It's not fair
to the horse.</i>

01:25:22.760 --> 01:25:26.312
<i>He can't run and play

01:25:28.136 --> 01:25:30.280
She doesn't go on.

01:25:31.367 --> 01:25:34.280
You know, I got hurt
like Apollo did.

01:25:35.304 --> 01:25:38.184
But I'm a person,
so I got to live.

01:25:44.073 --> 01:25:46.345
If any animal around here

01:25:47.113 --> 01:25:49.191
got hurt like I did,

01:25:49.193 --> 01:25:51.433
they'd have to be put down.

01:25:56.522 --> 01:25:58.375
You know, Lilly,

01:25:58.377 --> 01:26:01.321
I believe God gives
each of us a purpose.

01:26:02.057 --> 01:26:03.848
Very true.

01:26:03.850 --> 01:26:06.633
<i>To the horse, it's to
run across the prairie.</i>

01:26:08.713 --> 01:26:11.081

01:26:22.249 --> 01:26:24.360
Where are you
going with that?

01:26:24.362 --> 01:26:27.114
Where does it look like I'm going?
I'm going to the rodeo.

01:26:28.522 --> 01:26:30.825
You fucking crazy?

01:26:30.827 --> 01:26:34.376
I'm gonna ride. I figured
you were coming to watch.

01:26:34.378 --> 01:26:36.104
What the fuck
would I wanna come for?

01:26:36.106 --> 01:26:37.706
Watch you kill yourself?

01:26:44.172 --> 01:26:45.416
You're just stubborn as hell.

01:26:45.418 --> 01:26:46.921
You won't listen to nothing
anybody tells you anyway.

01:26:46.923 --> 01:26:49.065
Oh, I don't listen?
I always fucking listened.

01:26:49.067 --> 01:26:51.593
I listened to everything
you fucking said to me.

01:26:51.595 --> 01:26:55.753
What happened to "Cowboy up,"
"Grit your teeth," "Be a man"?

01:26:55.755 --> 01:26:57.483
What happened
to all that, Dad?

01:27:02.219 --> 01:27:04.074
You don't need to
go ride today.

01:27:04.076 --> 01:27:05.737
- You don't need to fucking go ride.
- Bullshit.

01:27:05.739 --> 01:27:06.793
I'm going.

01:27:06.795 --> 01:27:07.818
I'm entered, and I'm riding.

01:27:07.820 --> 01:27:09.483

01:27:16.652 --> 01:27:18.636
