00:19.133 --> 00:21.730
- Hello.
- [Mans Voice] Wanna have a little fun?

00:21.850 --> 00:24.846
- Who's this?
- Tell me your name and I'll tell you mine.

00:24.966 --> 00:26.804
I don't think so. [Farts] 

00:26.884 --> 00:29.721
- What's that noise?
- Oops. I farted.

00:29.800 --> 00:32.917
- I didn't think you would hear me.
- No, that popping noise.

00:33.037 --> 00:36.593
Oh. I'm making popcorn.
I'm getting ready to watch a video.

00:36.713 --> 00:40.228
- Ooh. What is it?
- It's just a scary movie.

00:40.348 --> 00:42.226
- Do you like scary movies?
- Mm-hmm.

00:42.346 --> 00:45.422
- What's your favorite?
- Mm, I don't know.

00:45.502 --> 00:47.341
Think.

00:47.420 --> 00:50.816
Oh, I know. Um, Kazaam,
the one where Shaq plays a genie.

00:50.895 --> 00:54.132
- That's not a horror movie.
- Well, you haven't seen Shaq act.

00:54.252 --> 00:55.811
[Popping] 

00:55.930 --> 00:58.886
- Hey, you have a nice voice.
- Thanks.

00:59.006 --> 01:01.044
You never did tell me your name.

01:01.164 --> 01:03.282
Why do you wanna know my name?

01:03.402 --> 01:05.958
Cause I wanna know
who I'm looking at.

01:07.597 --> 01:09.634
What--
What did you say?

01:09.714 --> 01:11.872
Nice breasts.

01:11.991 --> 01:13.789
Look, what do you want?

01:13.909 --> 01:16.467
I wanna see
what your insides look like.

01:16.586 --> 01:18.863
Well-- Well, then,
turn to page 54.

01:18.943 --> 01:20.502
Oh.

01:20.622 --> 01:22.419
Hey, nice.

01:24.176 --> 01:28.132
Listen, asshole, you've had your fun,
now you better stop or else.

01:28.252 --> 01:31.169
- Or else what?
- Or else my boyfriends
gonna be here any minute,

01:31.289 --> 01:33.247
and he's black
and he'll kick your ass.

01:33.326 --> 01:35.165
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

01:35.245 --> 01:37.282
You mean the one who wears makeup
and dresses like a woman?

01:37.402 --> 01:40.279
- How did you know?
- Turn the porch lights on.

01:46.192 --> 01:49.147
Help! Help!

01:49.227 --> 01:53.503
Oh, that's not my boyfriend.
I mean, I've fucked him a couple
of times, but that's it.

01:53.582 --> 01:56.699
- [Squealing] 
- Look, I'm calling the cops.

01:56.779 --> 01:58.896
Go ahead. Call the cops.

01:58.976 --> 02:01.893
But you might wanna
check the back door first.

02:02.013 --> 02:03.930
You forgot to lock it.

02:13.599 --> 02:15.717
[Doorbell Chimes] 

02:26.025 --> 02:27.862
Take that, you psycho!

02:29.261 --> 02:30.819
[Groaning] 

02:30.939 --> 02:32.976
I cant feel my legs.

02:33.057 --> 02:35.454
I think my arm is broken.

02:35.534 --> 02:38.970
- Sorry.
- I want my mommy.

02:41.886 --> 02:43.725
Hello, Drew.

03:00.505 --> 03:02.302
Oh, God!

03:04.020 --> 03:06.098
[Screams] 

03:59.835 --> 04:03.830
- Daddy! Daddy!
- Ugh!

04:03.950 --> 04:06.428
Daddy!

04:06.508 --> 04:08.745
- Daddy!
- [Groans] 

04:08.825 --> 04:11.822
Daddy, no! No!

04:13.699 --> 04:16.576
- Did you hear something?
- No, I didn't hear anything.

04:28.761 --> 04:31.199
[Keyboard Clicking] 

04:31.279 --> 04:33.116
[Rustling] 

04:42.026 --> 04:46.621
[Screams] Bobby, what are you doing?
My dads in the other room.

04:46.701 --> 04:49.257
It just occurred to me. I never
climbed through your window before.

04:49.377 --> 04:52.773
Now that you got it out of your system,
Bobby, you have to leave.

04:52.853 --> 04:54.051
Why?

04:54.171 --> 04:56.329
Shh. Come on.

04:56.449 --> 04:58.287
What's going on in there?

04:58.366 --> 05:01.523
Ow! Daddy's head is stuck.
Unstick Daddy's head.

05:01.643 --> 05:04.479
- [Groaning] 
- Dad, can you knock?

05:04.599 --> 05:08.834
- Knock?
I thought I heard screaming in here.
- No. No, you didn't, Dad.

05:08.914 --> 05:11.431
Well, it could've been that crack
I smoked earlier, I guess.

05:11.551 --> 05:13.310
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that's what it was.

05:13.389 --> 05:15.348
I gotta leave town
for a couple of days.

05:15.468 --> 05:18.104
No big deal. Just that new business
I started with those Colombian guys?

05:18.184 --> 05:20.861
- Oh, you mean Uncle Escobar.
- Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

05:20.981 --> 05:23.218
Well, there's a problem.
Some money went missing.

05:23.297 --> 05:25.256
And apparently,
some legs are gonna get broken.

05:25.376 --> 05:27.653
It's just better if I lay low
for a couple of days.

05:27.772 --> 05:30.050
- If the cops raid the place--
- I never heard of you.

05:30.170 --> 05:32.407
- And don't forget--
- To flush your stash.

05:32.487 --> 05:35.204
Oh, you are my little girl.
I love you so much...

05:35.324 --> 05:37.241
that I left you a little something
in the coffee can.

05:37.361 --> 05:40.797
- Dad--
- But you have to remember to step
on it before you sell it.

05:40.917 --> 05:43.713
- Now, what are you
gonna cut it with?
- Um, baking--

05:43.793 --> 05:45.632
Baking soda.
Not baking powder.

05:45.711 --> 05:48.628
Because baking powder guys
will have muffins growing
out of their nose.

05:48.707 --> 05:50.865
You love that joke,
don't you, honey?

05:50.946 --> 05:54.022
You've loved that joke
since you were two years old.

05:54.142 --> 05:56.139
- Okay, well--
- Okay, I love you.

05:56.259 --> 05:58.137
- I love you.
- Have a good trip.

05:58.217 --> 06:00.574
- Bye.
- Bye. Whew!

06:00.655 --> 06:02.771
Is the coast clear?

06:02.851 --> 06:05.888
Oh, Cindy, that nightgown.

06:06.008 --> 06:09.045
That was close. God!

06:12.120 --> 06:16.795
I was, uh, home watching
The Exorcist, and it
got me thinking about you.

06:16.915 --> 06:20.830
If this is about the time
I puked green slime
and masturbated with a crucifix--

06:20.950 --> 06:23.028
It was my first keg party, Bobby.

06:23.107 --> 06:27.422
No. No. Uh, it was edited for TV.
All the good stuff was cut out.

06:27.542 --> 06:30.299
So you thought you would just climb
through my window...

06:30.419 --> 06:32.336
and we would
play bump-bump?

06:32.456 --> 06:34.415
I was kind of hoping
to get my balls licked,

06:34.535 --> 06:37.092
but I wouldn't wanna break
your little underwear rule,
now, would I?

06:37.211 --> 06:40.367
So maybe just some
on-top-of-the-clothes type stuff?

06:43.565 --> 06:46.321
Okay. But just for a minute.

06:51.554 --> 06:54.352
[Soft Rock] 

07:00.983 --> 07:03.181
What the--

07:03.261 --> 07:05.139
Wrong set.

07:08.575 --> 07:12.010
Bobby! Oh, Bobby!

07:12.091 --> 07:15.087
I don't wanna wait
for our lives to be over

07:15.207 --> 07:17.245
- No, Bobby, don't.
- Ow!

07:19.402 --> 07:22.079
Jeez.

07:22.160 --> 07:24.636
Yeah, my dad.

07:24.756 --> 07:29.630
Okay, stud,
you have to go now.

07:32.467 --> 07:34.864
Oh, um,
about the sex stuff?

07:34.984 --> 07:37.222
I was only half serious.
I don't wanna rush you or anything.

07:37.341 --> 07:40.457
Hey, would you settle
for PG-13?

07:40.537 --> 07:43.054
What's that?

07:44.413 --> 07:45.611
Oh, jeez!

07:45.731 --> 07:48.169
-[Crash] 
- Good night, Bobby.

07:53.323 --> 07:56.359
- [Laughing] 
- Shorty, you are so loud.

07:56.479 --> 07:59.036
And make sure you take
your behind to class today.

07:59.115 --> 08:02.272
- I do be going to class.
- Lunch is not a class, Shorty.

08:02.352 --> 08:04.549
It is when you got
the munchies.

08:04.669 --> 08:08.385
- See, that's why
you such a dumb-ass.
- Your mother.

08:08.505 --> 08:12.300
You my brother.
That's your mother too, jackass.

08:12.420 --> 08:15.536
Oh, yeah.
Well, then, your fathers stupid.

08:15.657 --> 08:18.094
So? I don't know him.

08:18.213 --> 08:20.930
Yeah, me neither.

08:21.050 --> 08:24.645
- Hey, girl, you ready?
- Yeah, in a minute.

08:26.165 --> 08:28.801
- We're gonna be late.
- Wait. There's Buffy.

08:28.921 --> 08:32.116
[Grunts] I don't know why
you hang out with her.

08:32.197 --> 08:34.433
- She is such a ho.
- Why do you say that?

08:34.554 --> 08:36.991
Cause I've seen her.

08:37.111 --> 08:39.788
- My friend Sean
had a pool party this summer.
- Sean?

08:39.908 --> 08:41.785
You know, Puff Daddy?

08:41.905 --> 08:44.302
Anyway, everybody was drinking
Cristal champagne.

08:44.383 --> 08:47.339
And then it started to get wild,
and people were getting freaky
in the pool and stuff.

08:47.459 --> 08:51.375
I look over and there was
your girl getting buck wild
in the Jacuzzi.

08:51.494 --> 08:53.013
So?

08:53.093 --> 08:56.089
With a backup dancer.

08:56.209 --> 08:58.047
I mean, that's nasty.

08:58.127 --> 09:00.205
That's-That's lower
than the security guard.

09:00.325 --> 09:04.000
At least security can get you backstage.
She don't love herself.

09:04.079 --> 09:07.196
Bye, Daddy.
- I don't know. II think
Buffy's sweet, Brenda.

09:07.316 --> 09:10.513
She is as fake
as Press-onnails.

09:10.592 --> 09:12.829
Hey, baby girl!

09:14.388 --> 09:16.305
What is up,
my sister?

09:16.386 --> 09:18.902
- Bye, Mr. Gilmore.
- Bye!

09:19.022 --> 09:20.701
- Is he gone?
- Yep.

09:21.979 --> 09:25.655
Do you like what you see

09:25.774 --> 09:28.091
It's all about the money

09:28.171 --> 09:30.010
[Girl] 
Hey, Cindy!

09:32.926 --> 09:35.883
- I love this color.
- Let me see that.

09:37.920 --> 09:41.396
- Oh, you guys should
not use this brand.
- Why not?

09:41.476 --> 09:44.314
- Because they test
their products on animals.
- So?

09:44.433 --> 09:48.788
Look, have you seen what they do
to those poor animals?

09:50.585 --> 09:54.181
Well, I am much more
of a people person.

09:54.301 --> 09:57.417
I'd like to feed all the hungry,
little children of the world.

09:57.497 --> 09:59.934
I’d much rather help my fellow man
than some animal.

10:00.054 --> 10:01.852
- Spare a dollar?
- Get away from me, you bum!

10:01.972 --> 10:04.529
Buffy! Can't you see
he's just hungry?

10:04.649 --> 10:07.446
Here you go, sir.
A nice sandwich.

10:08.485 --> 10:11.881
- See?
- I said a dollar, bitch!

10:11.960 --> 10:14.159
Ow!

10:14.238 --> 10:17.234
God.
Look at this place.

10:17.354 --> 10:19.632
It's a circus.

10:19.711 --> 10:24.227
Hello. I'm Gail Hailstorm, author of 
the book, You're Dead, I'm Rich.

10:24.306 --> 10:26.463
A small college town
is in shock...

10:26.543 --> 10:28.662
after the unthinkable
has happened:

10:28.781 --> 10:31.658
a brutal killing spree
that left one teen dead--

10:31.737 --> 10:33.935
- That's it. Two teens dead...
- [Gunshot] 

10:34.055 --> 10:36.292
and this small town
shaken and stirred.

10:36.371 --> 10:39.768
- Its times like these--
- Police are combing
the area for clues.

10:39.888 --> 10:42.005
There are no witnesses
available at this time.

10:42.125 --> 10:43.923
There are no suspects
in custody.

10:44.043 --> 10:45.840
Police are asking anyone
to come forward.

10:45.960 --> 10:48.997
Reporting live for Black TV.
White folks are dead and we're
getting the fuck out of here!

10:49.077 --> 10:52.154
Grab your shit
and lets go, motherfucker!

10:55.309 --> 10:58.666
Hey, do you think the press is gonna
wanna talk to us?

10:58.786 --> 11:03.181
Oh, girl, no. The press
only wants to interview the most
ignorant person they can find.

11:03.301 --> 11:06.857
I'm on TV! Oh, shit!
First Cops, now this!

11:06.936 --> 11:08.774
Oh, man, I'm gonna be
a star, son!

11:08.854 --> 11:13.369
- What can you tell us about Drew?
- Well, she had the fat ass.

11:13.449 --> 11:16.325
- I mean, it was like bang!
- How close were you to the victim?

11:16.405 --> 11:18.883
Real close.
Until the roofies wore off.

11:18.962 --> 11:20.920
Then she woke up talking about
pressing charges.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.038
So I just pulled my tongue
out of her ass and left.

11:23.117 --> 11:25.195
What would have been
your last words to Drew?

11:25.315 --> 11:28.232
Run, bitch! Run!

11:31.188 --> 11:34.504
Hey, yo, dawg.
Does this shirt make me look gay?

11:34.584 --> 11:36.422
No, man.

11:38.100 --> 11:40.496
What about now?

11:40.577 --> 11:42.975
- Nah. Yeah.
- Cool?

11:43.054 --> 11:45.331
Here. Take one, guys.
Don't forget: elections Tuesday.

11:45.411 --> 11:47.808
Don't forget:
election's Tuesday.

11:47.928 --> 11:51.964
Ah! Goddamn it!
Son of a bitch!

11:52.044 --> 11:54.721
What's the matter, honey?

11:54.840 --> 11:56.639
My report card.

11:59.115 --> 12:01.074
Well, at least
you got one A.

12:01.153 --> 12:04.349
Yeah. I did, huh?

12:04.429 --> 12:07.905
- You're so smart.
- [Moaning] 

12:08.025 --> 12:10.263
- Hey, has anybody seen Bobby?
- Nah.

12:10.383 --> 12:12.660
You know what?
That kid is always late.

12:12.739 --> 12:14.977
I don't get it.
He lives so close.

12:15.098 --> 12:17.854
[Rock] 

12:24.365 --> 12:27.163
See you later,
Hairy Mama, Bubba, Jim,

12:27.242 --> 12:30.040
Big Jim, Little Jim,
Slim Jim, everybody.

12:30.119 --> 12:32.716
I'll see you later. Ciao, Ding.
All right.

12:38.829 --> 12:41.586
Damn, girl.
Mm-mm-mm.

12:41.666 --> 12:44.063
- I’d sure like to get in them pants.
- Really?

12:44.182 --> 12:46.620
Yeah. What size are these?

12:46.740 --> 12:48.617
[Bobby] 
Hey, guys.

12:48.697 --> 12:51.415
- Hey, Bobby.
- Hey, baby.

12:51.535 --> 12:53.971
- How you doing?
- Good.

12:54.090 --> 12:56.688
- You guys see all
the reporters out there?
- Yeah.

12:56.768 --> 12:59.005
Saying that girl Drew Decker
got killed last night.

12:59.125 --> 13:01.283
- You know what? I think I knew her.
- Really?

13:01.363 --> 13:04.279
- She had a brother named Steve?
- Yeah.

13:04.399 --> 13:06.876
Long hair, pretty little mouth,
perfect ass?

13:06.996 --> 13:09.754
- That was her.
- Nah, I was talking about Steve.

13:09.873 --> 13:11.750
Whatever happened
to him?

13:11.830 --> 13:14.628
Do you guys think its strange
that she got killed...

13:14.747 --> 13:17.863
exactly one year
after we,

13:17.943 --> 13:20.181
you know,
killed that guy?

13:20.261 --> 13:22.538
Hey, Cindy,
that was an accident.

13:22.617 --> 13:24.456
Was it, Greg?

13:41.037 --> 13:43.634
Would you look
at what they're doing?

13:43.754 --> 13:45.831
When are we gonna do
stuff like that, huh?

13:45.911 --> 13:47.788
One day.

13:47.868 --> 13:50.346
- You like that, baby?
- Yeah, that's different.

13:50.425 --> 13:52.622
- You like that?
- Oh, I love that.

13:52.702 --> 13:54.980
Oh, I love
when you play with my ass.

13:55.060 --> 13:56.897
I'm not playing
with your ass.

13:59.335 --> 14:02.771
- Ray!
- Oh, my bad.

14:02.891 --> 14:06.846
Come on, man!

-[Zipper Unzips] 
- Bobby, what are you doing?

15:08.933 --> 15:11.611
I just want you to touch it.
Just touch it. Come on.

15:11.691 --> 15:13.569
- Uh--
-Just a little bit. Come on.

15:13.688 --> 15:15.566
Whoo!

Oh, my God! Shit!

15:35.223 --> 15:38.499
God, Cindy--
Oh, shit!

15:49.486 --> 15:51.804
- [Ray] Oh, my God.
- What was that?

15:51.924 --> 15:53.881
I think
we hit something.

15:58.037 --> 16:00.713
Oh, man!

16:00.794 --> 16:04.509
Bobby, look at my car, man!
My dads gonna freak!

16:04.629 --> 16:07.226
[Bobby] I didn't see it.
It came out of nowhere.

16:07.345 --> 16:09.823
- Oh, my God, we hit a boot.
- Where's the foot?

16:09.943 --> 16:12.219
I don't know.

16:12.339 --> 16:15.096
Where the--

16:15.216 --> 16:17.334
- [Screams] 
- Its a body!

16:17.454 --> 16:19.331
- Oh, shit, is he alive?
- I don't know.

16:19.412 --> 16:21.369
- Well, check it out.
- I cant.

16:21.489 --> 16:24.446
- Shit!
- We have to call the police.

16:24.565 --> 16:27.482
- No way. I ain't going to jail.
- We have to!

16:27.602 --> 16:29.800
Cindy, do you know what they do
to young boys in prison?

16:29.880 --> 16:32.756
And all those sex-starved
convicts just waiting
for a fresh piece of meat.

16:32.875 --> 16:35.793
Hey, you're right, Cindy.
Maybe we should call the police.

16:35.913 --> 16:38.109
[Greg] Oh, yeah,
That's a great idea, Ray.
But what about Brenda, huh?

16:38.229 --> 16:40.027
You think she wants
to go to jail?

16:40.147 --> 16:42.025
This is manslaughter, okay?
We're all gonna fry for this.

16:42.105 --> 16:45.701
- We're looking at 10 to 15 years.
- Shut up, Bobby!

16:45.780 --> 16:48.617
- Its okay. I'm fine.
-Alcohol all over.
- We're in so much trouble.

16:48.698 --> 16:51.533
- I'm fine.
-[Brenda] Don't blame
that shit on me, Ray.

16:51.653 --> 16:55.489
- Look, well get rid of the body.
- Unnecessary.

16:55.570 --> 16:58.166
-[Brenda] Now you're thinking.
- We'll dump him in the ocean.
- Not the ocean, the pier.

16:58.286 --> 17:00.283
- Guess I'll be leaving now.
-[Greg] That's a great idea.

17:00.364 --> 17:02.321
- What about the alcohol?
- Well get rid of it.

17:02.441 --> 17:04.358
[Bobby] Come on. It'll be all right.

17:04.439 --> 17:06.596
- Come on. Hurry up. Lets go.
- Put him in the trunk.

17:06.715 --> 17:09.153
- I wont have anything to do with this!
-[Greg] Shut up!

17:09.233 --> 17:12.549
Cindy, come on.
Well just pretend it never happened.

17:12.628 --> 17:15.744
You know, like the time we got drunk
and we went down on each other.

17:15.826 --> 17:18.742
- I'll get his arm.
- I'll grab. I'll grab his other arm.
- I'll grab his ass.

17:18.862 --> 17:21.978
Well take him down to Williamson Cove
and we'll dump him in there.

17:22.098 --> 17:23.935
The sharks'll take care
of the evidence.

17:24.016 --> 17:26.013
Oh, my God,
someone's coming.

17:26.093 --> 17:29.850
- Oh, shit. Its Shorty.
- Brenda, take care of him.

17:31.527 --> 17:35.882
[Rap Playing On Radio] 

17:36.001 --> 17:38.919
Shorty, I know you ain't driving
without no papers.

17:38.998 --> 17:41.994
I got papers,
blunts, bongs,

17:42.114 --> 17:44.472
all the ingredients
to make a high niggard pie.

17:46.230 --> 17:49.626
- Hey, yo, can I help you?
- Yo, what's up, Ray?

17:49.706 --> 17:52.503
- Yo, son, you all need jumper cables?
- Nah, we're cool.

17:52.583 --> 17:56.178
Oh, good, cause I left
my roach clip at home.

17:56.258 --> 17:59.015
- Go home, Shorty.
- Yeah, I-I'll see you later.

17:59.095 --> 18:00.853
Peace, Ray.

18:00.972 --> 18:03.370
- Get the trunk closed.
-[Buffy] It won't close.

18:03.490 --> 18:06.007
- I'll do it.
- [Groaning] 

18:06.126 --> 18:08.924
[Shorty Laughing] 

18:29.579 --> 18:32.496
Hold on. Hold on. Put him down.
He's heavy. Oh, God.

18:34.613 --> 18:38.170
Okay, look. On three we dump him
over the ledge.

18:38.290 --> 18:40.606
Wait, wait, wait.
Shouldn't we at least check his wallet?

18:40.726 --> 18:44.202
- For what?
- Shit, he might have some money.

18:44.322 --> 18:47.119
We already committed murder.
We might as well rob his ass.

18:47.199 --> 18:49.835
- I'll take the credit cards.
- I want his jewelry.
- I'm gonna take his drawers.

18:49.916 --> 18:54.749
- [All Shouting] 
- Get off!. Hey, yo, get off!.
His drawers are mine! Yo!

18:54.869 --> 18:58.345
- [Chuckling] I got me a gold ring.
- Credit cards.

18:58.465 --> 19:01.822
- All right, lets get him in the water.
- I don't think I can, Greg.

19:01.941 --> 19:04.259
- Its not too late.
- Shut up, okay?

19:04.378 --> 19:08.334
- Christ, already. I'll do it.
-Just get him in the water.

19:08.414 --> 19:11.211
Okay. One, two,

19:11.291 --> 19:13.128
three.

19:17.124 --> 19:20.560
Right now we make a pact.
We take this to our grave.

19:20.680 --> 19:22.158
-Agreed?
- Agreed.
- Agreed.

19:22.238 --> 19:24.115
- Agreed?
- [Brenda, Bobby] Agreed.

19:24.196 --> 19:27.152
Say it, Cindy. Say it!

19:27.232 --> 19:30.029
We take this to our grave. Say it!

19:30.109 --> 19:32.625
- [Gagging] 
- We take this to our grave. Say it.

19:32.745 --> 19:34.543
Greg, chill. Come on.
You're hurting her.

19:34.663 --> 19:37.540
We take this
to our grave. Ow.

19:37.620 --> 19:40.177
And we never
mention this again.

19:40.258 --> 19:42.135
Mention what?

19:42.214 --> 19:46.570
- The guy we just killed.
- Well, you just mentioned it, Greg.

19:46.689 --> 19:48.367
Starting now!

19:48.447 --> 19:50.605
Stupid bitch, man.

19:50.685 --> 19:54.320
- God. I hate him.
- Its gonna be okay, baby.
It's gonna be okay.

19:54.440 --> 19:58.795
I promise. Just touch it again.
Come on. Please.

20:01.751 --> 20:05.028
- You have to move on, Cindy.
That's all behind us now.
- Exactly.

20:05.108 --> 20:07.425
- Its a coincidence.
- Gregss right, Cindy.

20:07.504 --> 20:10.142
I mean, what do you think
we're in, a horror movie?

20:10.222 --> 20:13.737
Yeah, you guys are right.
If we were,

20:13.857 --> 20:18.372
they'd probably cast some dingbat
like Jennifer Love Huge Tits to play me.

20:18.492 --> 20:22.127
Yeah, or they'd cast people
in their late twenties,
early thirties to play us.

20:24.366 --> 20:27.841
-[Bell Rings] 
- Kenny, get the camera ready.
Here. Hold my gum.

20:29.839 --> 20:32.995
- Sheriff, Sheriff,
can I get a statement?
- No comment.

20:33.115 --> 20:38.149
Damn. Who do I have to screw around here
to get a stupid story?

Hey! Hey, no running.

Hi. Gail Hailstorm.
Field Reporter, Hard Story.

20:52.652 --> 20:54.730
Special Officer Doofy.

20:54.849 --> 20:58.646
Oh, hi, Doofy. Doofy, listen.
Is there a problem on campus?

20:58.725 --> 21:00.842
- No comment. No comment.
- Okay. Okay.

21:00.962 --> 21:04.479
You know, you look awfully young
to be a police officer.

21:04.558 --> 21:06.955
- I'm 25 and a half years old.
- Ooh!

21:07.035 --> 21:09.153
- Yeah, that's this many.
- Ah, so big.

21:09.273 --> 21:11.350
Yeah. That's big.

21:11.430 --> 21:13.948
- Well, you don't look
a day over 12.
- [Chuckles] 

21:14.027 --> 21:17.584
Except for the big head
and glazed-over look in your eyes.

21:17.704 --> 21:21.139
- Ooh, was that drool?
- Yeah. I forgot to swallow.

21:21.218 --> 21:24.495
Don't worry,
cause I never forget.

21:24.575 --> 21:26.413
- [Both Laughing] 
- [Farts] 

21:26.532 --> 21:28.850
- Would you remind me
not to do that again?
- Sorry.

21:28.930 --> 21:31.806
[Man Over P.A.] 
Due to the recent tragedy, the sheriff
and me, your principal,

21:31.926 --> 21:34.244
will be questioning all students
throughout the day.

21:34.364 --> 21:37.121
Wow. Sounds like we've got the makings
of a serial killer on our hands.

21:37.241 --> 21:39.837
Yeah, I'm not supposed to say.
It's official police business.

21:39.957 --> 21:43.752
Hey, Doofy, what do you say you and I
go inside my van over there...

21:43.872 --> 21:46.429
and, uh, get to know
each other a little better?

21:46.549 --> 21:50.145
- Would you like that?
Yeah, that van right there.
- That van?

21:50.265 --> 21:52.622
- [Chuckles] 
- Yeah.

21:52.703 --> 21:56.058
- Yeah, okay, lets go. Come on.
- Oh!

21:56.178 --> 22:00.014
A terrible tragedy
and an unbearable loss.

22:00.093 --> 22:04.009
Its days like today
that we need prayer in school.

22:04.089 --> 22:08.884
It starts to unravel
the very moral fabric
of our society.

22:09.003 --> 22:11.120
Here you go, baby.

22:11.200 --> 22:13.038
Go to your daddy.

22:13.118 --> 22:15.435
Oh!

22:15.515 --> 22:18.512
[Chuckles] 
I'll see you after class.

22:18.631 --> 22:20.469
- Sweet!
- All right!

22:20.549 --> 22:24.225
Okay, class, who would like to give
their oral presentation first?

22:24.345 --> 22:27.062
- Oh!
- Anybody?

22:27.182 --> 22:30.058
- Yes!
- Anybody else?

22:37.291 --> 22:39.647
- Okay. Can I start?
- Yeah.

22:39.767 --> 22:42.843
Okay, my presentation
is on the First Amendment.

22:42.963 --> 22:47.199
And it began on May 25, 1787 in Philly
with George Washington.

22:47.318 --> 22:49.116
And it states, and I quote,

22:49.236 --> 22:52.312
When our Founding Fathers argued the passage
of our glorious Constitution--

22:52.432 --> 22:55.309
[Heather Continuing] 

23:39.937 --> 23:43.333
The First Amendment gives us the right
to say what we want--

23:43.453 --> 23:46.249
Oh, shut the fuck up!

23:46.369 --> 23:49.486
- So, who's next?
- [Putting] 

23:49.606 --> 23:52.482
Uh, Cindy Campbell.

23:52.602 --> 23:55.718
Isn't she the daughter
of, well, you know--

23:55.838 --> 23:59.235

- Old Mrs. --

23:59.314 --> 24:02.071

the one and only--

24:02.190 --> 24:05.427
The one and only.
[Clears Throat] 

24:05.547 --> 24:09.023

24:09.103 --> 24:13.138
- Thanks, Doofy.
- Its Special Officer Doofy today,
Cindy.

24:13.257 --> 24:17.453
Now, Cindy, Sheriff has some questions
that he would like to ask you today.

24:17.573 --> 24:20.929
- What is that... god-awful smell?
- I don't know.

24:21.009 --> 24:22.287
I got a poopie.

24:23.406 --> 24:26.203
Did you just say
that you went poopie?

24:26.282 --> 24:29.240
- Yeah. It was good.
-[Sheriff] Mm.

24:29.319 --> 24:32.315
- Get him out of here.
- Yes.

24:32.435 --> 24:34.833
- Thank you, Doofy.
- [Doofy] Okay.

24:34.912 --> 24:37.270
You should now go back
to Special Ed.

24:37.349 --> 24:40.826
- Okay. Salute.
- Maybe a change of underwear, son.

24:40.905 --> 24:43.983
- Bye, Doofy.
- Bye, Cindy.

24:44.102 --> 24:46.739
- How are you, Cindy?
- Fine.

24:46.818 --> 24:49.616
- How are you, Sheriff?
- Bloated, constipated.

24:49.695 --> 24:53.131
Got a boil on my ass
the size of a walnut.
You know, the usual.

24:53.251 --> 24:56.007
Cindy, I want to ask you
some questions about Drew Decker.

24:57.726 --> 25:00.363
- I didn't really know her.
- Oh, come on. Sure you do.

25:00.483 --> 25:02.720
No. I mean,
I didn't really know her.

25:02.840 --> 25:06.356
I've been in this game a long time.
Don't bullshit a bullshitter.

25:06.435 --> 25:09.792
Tell me about Drew. What
was she like in bed, Cindy?

25:10.951 --> 25:13.947
Tried to get you.
Its an old police trick.

25:14.067 --> 25:17.463
Its an old police trick.
You didn't fall for it.
Good for you, kid.

25:17.544 --> 25:19.380

25:20.300 --> 25:22.737

Damn.

25:40.915 --> 25:44.112
Yo, Greg, what's up?
You gonna hit the showers or what?

25:44.191 --> 25:48.187
No, man. I think I'm gonna work out,

Who did this? Huh?

It's a shame how she died.

- She was such a nice girl.
- Yeah, she used to baby-sit my brother Doofy.

26:54.390 --> 26:57.905

- That's bullshit, Cindy.

27:42.653 --> 27:44.571
Someone just trying
to fuck with us.

27:44.691 --> 27:47.208
We have to call
the police, Greg.

39:06.774 --> 39:11.968
- What you doin', son?
- Nothin'... Just chillin'... killin'...

39:12.047 --> 39:14.565
True. True.

39:14.885 --> 39:16.683
So you think
Bobby did it?

39:19.999 --> 39:22.916
I don't know.
But he was there, Buffy.

39:23.036 --> 39:26.910
I knew there had to be something.
He just too perfect.

39:26.991 --> 39:30.187
Handsome, smart,
good in bed.

39:30.307 --> 39:34.142
- What did you say?
- Uh--

39:34.262 --> 39:37.459
Hey, Cindy.
Got your ice pack for your hand.

39:37.578 --> 39:40.175
- Ow!
- Sorry.

39:40.295 --> 39:42.732
- [Groans] 
- I'll get you one for your head.

39:42.852 --> 39:45.090
No, no, that's okay, Doofy.

39:45.210 --> 39:49.484
Hey, we are gonna get that guy
you dumped in the water. Yeah.

39:49.604 --> 39:51.522
I'll be next door
if you need me.

39:51.641 --> 39:54.878
Night, Cindy.

39:54.958 --> 39:56.356
Buffy, you told him?

39:56.436 --> 39:59.392
The moron overheard a conversation
Greg and I were having.

39:59.473 --> 40:01.790
- Yeah, but what
if he says something?
- Who's gonna believe...

40:01.871 --> 40:04.467
a retarded retard
like him anyway?

40:04.546 --> 40:06.905
Cindy, telephone.

40:09.022 --> 40:10.819
Thank you.

40:10.939 --> 40:14.135
- Hello.
- [Mans Voice] Hello, Cindy.

40:14.216 --> 40:16.494
- Guess what.
- No!

40:16.613 --> 40:18.570
- You got the wrong guy.
- No!

40:18.690 --> 40:20.488
- Doofy!
- Its not Bobby.

40:20.607 --> 40:22.406
- Who is this?
- [Dial Tone] 

40:22.526 --> 40:25.083
- Doofy! Doofy!
- Oh, my God.

40:32.035 --> 40:36.270
Hello?

40:36.350 --> 40:40.825
I said don't disturb me
while I'm cleaning my room!

40:46.458 --> 40:48.855
I heard Bobby got out
this morning.

40:48.975 --> 40:52.092
I haven't seen him around.
Is he pissed?

40:52.212 --> 40:56.087
You mean since
you branded him the Candy man?
No. His heart is broken.

40:56.206 --> 40:59.123
Yo, son. Its like
I seen this all before.

40:59.202 --> 41:01.121
They had a killer at
your old high school, Shorty?

41:01.241 --> 41:03.038
No, it was in this movie Scream.

41:03.158 --> 41:05.476
Same dialogue and everything.
This is ill.

41:05.596 --> 41:07.393
- How did it end?
- I don't know.

41:07.513 --> 41:10.510
Some niggas started shooting
up in the movie theater,
so we just broke out.

41:10.590 --> 41:14.146
- No doubt.
- Okay, I say we all
just stick together.

41:14.265 --> 41:16.184
Tonight everyone
meet at my house.

41:16.304 --> 41:19.739
And bring some friends. But don't tell everyone.
Try to keep it quiet.

41:19.859 --> 41:21.178
Okay.

41:21.297 --> 41:26.092
Yo! Party at Cindy's house!
Drunk white women for everybody!

41:27.609 --> 41:32.204
Ray, if you see Bobby,
tell him I love him.

41:32.284 --> 41:36.320
Okay. If I see Bobby,
I'll tell him I love him.

41:43.032 --> 41:45.469
-Jesus!
- Its okay. It's all right.
It's just me, baby.

41:45.589 --> 41:48.465
- What, you don't still
think It's me, do you?
- No.

41:48.585 --> 41:50.583
It's just that somebody
did try to kill me.

41:50.703 --> 41:54.858
- And the police said
I scared him away.
- I know. He called me last night.

41:54.938 --> 41:58.214
You see, it couldn't have been me.
I was in jail last night. Remember?

42:00.372 --> 42:02.249
You're the best.

42:02.329 --> 42:04.687
I'm sorry.
Please understand.

42:04.766 --> 42:07.483
Understand what?
That my girlfriend would rather
call me a killer than touch me?

42:07.603 --> 42:09.402
- That's not true, Bobby.
- Then what is it?

42:09.521 --> 42:11.838
What is it?
She's gone and she's not coming back.

42:11.958 --> 42:16.153
- Its been over a year, Cindy.
- But Ginger was such an important
part of the Spice Girls.

42:16.273 --> 42:19.350
- Oh, you gotta move on, baby.
- Oh!

42:19.470 --> 42:22.066
I'm sorry if my complicated life...

42:33.374 --> 42:37.408
the killing of these teenagers
has been tragic, but, uh--

Sheriff!. Sheriff!.

42:42.922 --> 42:45.998
- Yes, Miss Thunderstorm.
- Have they found
Cindy Campbell's father?

42:46.118 --> 42:48.076
- No.
- Isn't he a suspect?

42:48.196 --> 42:50.233
That is classified information.
Where are you getting that?

42:50.353 --> 42:53.909
I'm sorry, but my sources
are strictly confidential, Sheriff.

42:53.989 --> 42:56.386
Hey, Gail.

Hello. Who is this?

Now, as you all have heard,
there is a killer in town...

43:28.908 --> 43:32.105
and the police have asked us to give you
the following safety tips.

43:32.225 --> 43:34.301
Stay in well-lit areas.

43:34.421 --> 43:36.699
Do not travel alone
whenever possible.

43:36.819 --> 43:38.657
Always wipe front to back.

43:38.736 --> 43:41.173
And remember, never, ever
believe someone...

43:41.293 --> 43:44.410
when they tell you
that shaving your pubic hair...

43:44.489 --> 43:47.327
will rid you
of crab infestation.

43:47.407 --> 43:51.202
Now, I understand
this is a difficult time
for you young ladies.

43:51.283 --> 43:54.159
So if anyone needs
to come to my office to talk,

43:54.279 --> 43:56.197
I am here for you.

Come in, dear. Have a seat.
Take off your bra if you'd like.

44:23.364 --> 44:26.162
No, thanks.

44:26.241 --> 44:28.279
What can I do for you,
Cindy?

44:28.399 --> 44:32.394
I need to talk.
See, I have this problem...

44:32.474 --> 44:34.671
and I don't know
who to tell.

44:34.791 --> 44:38.627
- Not feeling so fresh?
- Huh?

44:38.706 --> 44:41.025

got you down?

Uh, no. No, not that.

Then what is it?

44:47.456 --> 44:50.494
I have a terrible secret.

44:50.613 --> 44:53.409
Well, Cindy, we all have
our little secrets.

44:56.286 --> 44:58.603
Sometimes we do things
we're not so proud of.

44:58.723 --> 45:01.240
Some for money,

45:01.360 --> 45:04.676
others to gain the athletic edge
on the competition.

45:04.757 --> 45:07.233
Sometimes those secrets
come back to haunt us.

45:07.313 --> 45:09.270
- Aah!
- Do you know what I mean?

45:09.391 --> 45:13.865
Yes, I do, um, Miss Mann.

don't kill me.

Well if the killer was in your house 
last night, why didn't he just 
kill you then?

Because he's just
messing with us.

let nothin' happen to you.

- Can you tell us what you are
doing out here all alone?

Well, yeah, sure.
My boyfriend and I were
just, like, making out...

50:48.435 --> 50:50.711
and then we heard a noise out there,
so he went to go check it,

like, ten minutes ago.

01:05:11.147 --> 01:05:13.504
[Rapping] 
Don't even contest
Cause I’ll make you undress

01:05:13.584 --> 01:05:16.061
Like porn dancers
waitin' at the front door for an answer

01:05:16.181 --> 01:05:19.178
Hey, yo, I'm sick of artificial MCs
like silicone titties

01:05:19.298 --> 01:05:21.655
Hey, yo, check it, yo.
Fuck a cheap ball

01:05:21.735 --> 01:05:23.652
I wanna smoke Cheech and Chong

01:05:23.733 --> 01:05:26.090
And if I wanna fuck long,
I let my ding-a-long, hit the bong

01:05:26.210 --> 01:05:28.527
And then the song,
Always pass the dutchie to the left

01:05:28.607 --> 01:05:31.404
Because the right way
is wrong
[Cackling] 

01:05:31.484 --> 01:05:35.039
- Whoo-hoo!
- I got one. I got one.
Here it goes. Ready?

01:05:35.158 --> 01:05:37.836
I'm gonna slash and gash
Cut another hole in your ass

01:05:37.956 --> 01:05:40.393
I spill blood on the walls
then play tennis with your balls

01:05:40.513 --> 01:05:42.351
If the phone rings
don't answer the call

01:05:42.470 --> 01:05:44.388
Gonna slit your throat
fuck you like a goat

01:05:44.508 --> 01:05:47.345
Peel your foreskin off
and make a winter coat
Peace!

01:05:49.702 --> 01:05:52.419
Yo!

01:05:52.539 --> 01:05:56.374
That was the illest rhyme
I ever seen, son!

01:05:58.332 --> 01:06:02.487
Bobby... where were you tonight?

01:06:02.567 --> 01:06:05.723
- What?
- I was just curious.

01:06:05.843 --> 01:06:07.681
What took you so long
to get here?

01:06:07.801 --> 01:06:09.759
Why you so curious?

01:06:11.277 --> 01:06:13.115
I don't know.

01:06:13.195 --> 01:06:15.393
I thought it would fit
the 90s horror cliché...

01:06:15.513 --> 01:06:18.029
if you turned out
to be the killer.

01:06:18.109 --> 01:06:20.746
Oh, so, what? You think
I killed Buffy and Greg?

01:06:22.584 --> 01:06:24.541
Buffy and Greg are dead?

01:06:25.821 --> 01:06:27.458
- I thought you knew that.
- Oh, my God!

01:06:27.578 --> 01:06:30.615
Bobby, turn around!
Its the killer!

01:06:30.735 --> 01:06:34.530
[Screaming] 

01:06:44.238 --> 01:06:46.077
- Cindy!
- [Gasps] 

01:06:46.197 --> 01:06:49.153
- Oh, my God! Bobby! Bobby!
- Cindy. Help me.

01:06:50.791 --> 01:06:53.906
- Bobby, its okay.
- Gimme the gun. Gimme-

01:06:54.947 --> 01:06:57.423
Its gonna be okay, Bobby.

01:06:58.701 --> 01:07:01.618
Yo, wait for me!
There's a killer in the house!

01:07:01.738 --> 01:07:03.576
There's ass, blood
and guts everywhere!

01:07:03.696 --> 01:07:05.933
Someone done gone crazy,
son!

01:07:06.013 --> 01:07:10.448
- [Chuckling] 
We all go a little crazy sometimes.
- Bobby, no!

01:07:11.566 --> 01:07:13.684
Oh, shit, son!

01:07:13.804 --> 01:07:16.560

01:07:22.913 --> 01:07:24.751
You wanna hit this shit?

01:07:28.827 --> 01:07:30.665
Ketchup.

01:07:30.744 --> 01:07:32.981
Just like my mom puts on
her spaghetti, baby.

01:07:35.059 --> 01:07:37.856
Oh, my God! Ray, you’ve gotta help me!
Bobby’s gone crazy!

01:07:41.411 --> 01:07:44.089
- [Killers Voice] Surprise, Cindy!
- [Gasps] 

01:07:55.595 --> 01:07:57.593
Why are you doing this, Bobby?

01:07:57.713 --> 01:08:01.188
Why? Why? You hear that, Ray?

01:08:01.308 --> 01:08:03.706
I think she wants
a motive.

01:08:03.826 --> 01:08:05.663
- Did Scream have a plot?
- No.

01:08:05.743 --> 01:08:09.059
[Chuckles] 
Did I Know What You Did Last Summer
make any sense?

01:08:09.140 --> 01:08:11.776
Don't think so!

01:08:11.856 --> 01:08:14.573
What about the sequel?
What was with that fat,
white Jamaican kid?

01:08:14.692 --> 01:08:17.609
- I wanna kill that motherfucker.
- It was bad casting, Bobby.

01:08:17.729 --> 01:08:20.126
How about this for a motive?
Lack of sex!

01:08:20.246 --> 01:08:23.243
It can cause serious
deviant behavior.

01:08:23.363 --> 01:08:26.759
- I thought you loved me.
- Oh, I did, baby.

01:08:26.877 --> 01:08:30.634
I did. But abstinence can make you
discover new things about yourself.

01:08:30.752 --> 01:08:33.151
That's right, Cindy. I'm gay.

01:08:33.270 --> 01:08:35.868
And in case you haven't noticed,
so is Ray.

01:08:37.466 --> 01:08:39.662
What? I ain't gay.

01:08:39.743 --> 01:08:42.899
- What are you talking about?
You took me to that club.
- So, they play good music.

01:08:42.979 --> 01:08:47.095
- What about our trip
to San Francisco, then?
- I wanted to go shopping.

01:08:48.773 --> 01:08:52.209
- But you made love to me.
- No. First of all, you sucked my--

01:08:52.288 --> 01:08:54.725
Whatever, Ray!
I don't want to talk about this now.

01:08:54.845 --> 01:08:58.482
The point is, I'm a new man,
and I'm ready to leave all this
behind and start a new life.

01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:02.557
- So you killed all your friends?
- Oh, no.

01:09:02.676 --> 01:09:04.474
Just you.

01:09:04.594 --> 01:09:06.752
And maybe Shorty,
but that wasn’t planned or anything.

01:09:06.872 --> 01:09:09.149
But here's the genius part.

01:09:09.229 --> 01:09:12.465
We're copycatting a serial killer
that already exists.

01:09:12.546 --> 01:09:16.180
- Its the perfect crime, Cindy.
- But wait! There's more!

01:09:16.301 --> 01:09:21.375
Hang on to your seat, baby,
cause this one’s a screamer!

01:09:21.495 --> 01:09:24.611
- I'll be back.
- Uh-oh.

01:09:24.731 --> 01:09:27.008
Move your big ass.
Come on.

01:09:27.127 --> 01:09:29.326
- Dad!
- [Grunts] 

01:09:29.404 --> 01:09:31.962
What are you gonna do,
frame him?

01:09:32.082 --> 01:09:36.118
Nah. We're just havin' a little bit
of fun with old daddio.

01:09:36.238 --> 01:09:39.274
The police are gonna find
you and daddy both dead,

01:09:39.354 --> 01:09:42.908
and me and Ray are the only survivors
of maniacs revenge.

01:09:43.029 --> 01:09:45.827
- You ready? I'm ready.
- You ready? I'm ready to do this shit.

01:09:45.946 --> 01:09:48.303
- Come on. Come on. All right.
- All right.

01:09:48.383 --> 01:09:50.621

- Come on. Come on.

01:09:57.453 --> 01:09:58.931
Give it to me!

01:09:59.051 --> 01:10:00.809
No! Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait!

01:10:00.889 --> 01:10:02.686
- Remember what we talked about?
To the side.
- I know.

01:10:02.806 --> 01:10:04.604
- How many times
we gonna go over this?
- Okay.

01:10:04.724 --> 01:10:06.602
Stop. Just--
All right. Trust me, okay?

01:10:06.682 --> 01:10:09.239
- All right. I'm ready.
- Trust me. I got this shit. Ready?

01:10:09.359 --> 01:10:12.155
- Wait, wait, wait!
- I'm about to cut your throat, boy!

Stop acting like a little girl.
Come on. Come on!

01:10:20.626 --> 01:10:22.743
You've seen
one too many TV shows!

01:10:22.863 --> 01:10:26.938
No! Watching television shows
doesn't create psycho killers!

01:10:27.058 --> 01:10:29.296
Cancelin' TV shows does!

01:10:29.415 --> 01:10:31.613
The Wayans Brothers
was a good show, man!

01:10:31.692 --> 01:10:36.048
It was a good-ass show,
and we didn't even get a final episode!

01:10:36.168 --> 01:10:39.205
Take it easy!
I'm feelin' a little woozy here!

01:10:39.284 --> 01:10:41.961

- Are you okay?

01:12:39.064 --> 01:12:41.821
I thought I told you
not to have a party unless I was here.

01:12:41.941 --> 01:12:44.298
But, Dad, you were here.
You were in the closet.

01:12:44.377 --> 01:12:47.734
Oh, yeah, that's right. Did you get some
girlfriends numbers for me?

01:12:47.853 --> 01:12:50.771
- Dad, they're dead.

- He was right here! I swear it!
- Who was?

01:13:20.935 --> 01:13:24.171
The killer!
The guy that murdered all my friends!

01:13:24.251 --> 01:13:27.807
And the sick bastard planted drugs
all in the house there.

01:13:27.887 --> 01:13:30.684
- All over the place.
- Dad. Stop it.

01:13:30.804 --> 01:13:33.440
All right, Cindy.
I'm gonna have to take you
down to the station.

01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:35.478
I'm cool, though, right?

01:13:35.598 --> 01:13:37.475

Okay. Lets go over this again.

01:14:01.208 --> 01:14:03.046
- You say it was an accident.
- Yes.

01:14:03.125 --> 01:14:06.162
- He was on the road.
- And you think he came back
to get revenge?

01:14:06.282 --> 01:14:08.999
- It has to be him, Sheriff.
- [Banging] 

01:14:14.353 --> 01:14:16.350
Here, Sheriff.
They wanted me to give this to you.

01:14:16.430 --> 01:14:19.347
- That’ll be all, Doofy.
- Okay.

01:14:19.467 --> 01:14:21.784
- I'm gonna go, then. All right.
- All right.

01:14:22.942 --> 01:14:24.741
Bye, Cindy.

01:14:27.816 --> 01:14:30.094
I’m sorry, Cindy.
It wasn't the man you guys killed.

01:14:30.214 --> 01:14:33.491
His name was David Keegan.
Some fishermen found his body
a few weeks later.

01:14:33.611 --> 01:14:36.886
- He's buried in Lakewood Cemetery.
- That's impossible.

01:14:39.164 --> 01:14:41.441
- Then I don't know who it could be.
- He's gotta be someone else...

01:14:41.561 --> 01:14:44.798
who was connected with all the victims,
someone who knew about the accident.

01:14:44.917 --> 01:14:47.434
Someone who could move around
without being noticed.

01:14:49.672 --> 01:14:52.667
Oh, my God.

01:14:52.747 --> 01:14:56.424
She used to baby-sit my brother Doofy.
He had the biggest crush on her.

01:14:56.543 --> 01:14:59.301
[Gasping] Its me, Cindy.

01:14:59.380 --> 01:15:00.898
Night, Cindy.

01:15:04.654 --> 01:15:06.651
- Doofy!
- Shit head?

01:15:09.808 --> 01:15:11.646
- Have you seen Doofy?
- No.

01:15:11.725 --> 01:15:13.843
- Have you seen Doofy?
Has anybody seen Doofy?
- No, Sheriff.

01:15:13.924 --> 01:15:16.320
- No.
- [Man] Yeah.
Just went out the back, Sheriff.

01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:18.558
[Sheriff] Doofy!

01:15:31.102 --> 01:15:34.339
He walks alone
under the big city lights

01:15:34.459 --> 01:15:38.016
He always knows
just when the time is right

01:15:38.135 --> 01:15:41.371
He never shows what he's thinking
He keeps it inside

01:15:41.491 --> 01:15:45.047
Because he's
too cool for school

01:15:45.126 --> 01:15:48.483
He comes alive
when the sun goes down

01:15:48.602 --> 01:15:51.919
He gets it right
You know he's always down

01:15:52.039 --> 01:15:55.354
He's got one eye open
and his ear to the ground

01:15:55.474 --> 01:15:58.311
And he's too cool for school

01:16:00.029 --> 01:16:03.345
He's an operator
He's a real player

01:16:37.785 --> 01:16:41.980
But either way it goes,
I'm gonna tell you all the rules
to survive this situation.

01:16:42.100 --> 01:16:45.096
Rule number one:
You gotta be quick.

01:16:45.176 --> 01:16:48.373
Rule number two:
Don't fall down.

01:16:48.453 --> 01:16:53.287
And rule number three:
Whatever you do, never look back.

01:16:53.367 --> 01:16:55.485
You all wish me luck.

01:16:55.604 --> 01:16:57.482
Snatch and run, you all!

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.356
Come back here, you motherfuckers!
Son of a bitch!

01:17:03.305 --> 01:17:09.165
