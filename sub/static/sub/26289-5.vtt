00:01.402 --> 00:03.471
It's time to take a stand
with The Gifted.

00:03.504 --> 00:06.006
-People need something
to believe in.
-Ahh!

00:06.040 --> 00:08.076
Catch all-new episodes Tuesdays.

00:08.109 --> 00:09.977
And check out
our other Fox programs--

00:10.010 --> 00:11.579
9-1-1, The Resident,

00:11.612 --> 00:12.880
and Lethal Weapon.

00:12.913 --> 00:15.749
-Hey, partner.
-Only on Fox.

00:18.286 --> 00:20.088
-I'm here to take you home.
-Move!

00:20.121 --> 00:21.122
I can't do that.

00:25.959 --> 00:27.395
JACE:
I'm doing this for Grace

00:27.428 --> 00:28.996
and for every other kid
just like her.

00:29.029 --> 00:30.030
Stop calling.

00:31.065 --> 00:32.500
JACE:
You're with the Purifiers.

00:32.533 --> 00:33.601
I don't think I'm down
to join a...

00:33.634 --> 00:34.602
Hate group?

00:34.635 --> 00:36.704
If you change your mind.

00:36.737 --> 00:40.074
I have information you want.
In exchange, I need assistance.

00:40.108 --> 00:41.842
Are you asking me to be a spy?

00:41.875 --> 00:43.677
Since your failure in Atlanta,

00:43.711 --> 00:45.246
half the Underground's
been taken apart.

00:45.279 --> 00:46.447
You think I'm gonna
let you destroy

00:46.480 --> 00:47.748
the rest of what we built?

00:47.781 --> 00:49.383
Lorna!

00:49.417 --> 00:51.119
(people screaming, shouting)

00:51.152 --> 00:53.687
BLINK:
They're killing each other.

00:53.721 --> 00:55.923
We can't just leave
these people here.

00:55.956 --> 00:58.058
Come on.

00:58.092 --> 01:01.962
They got away, and they took
at least one patient with them.

01:03.231 --> 01:06.300
DAN: I'm just saying,
you want to move up?

01:06.334 --> 01:07.901
Do your street time.

01:07.935 --> 01:10.070
Lot of rookies want
to write the detective exam

01:10.104 --> 01:11.739
the minute they get a badge.

01:11.772 --> 01:14.275
Nah, I'm just taking it
one day at a time for right now.

01:14.308 --> 01:16.076
Yeah. Nice try.

01:16.110 --> 01:18.746
I've been around for a while.
I know your type.

01:18.779 --> 01:21.615
Just don't get ahead
of yourself.

01:26.154 --> 01:27.555
What's up?

01:27.588 --> 01:30.258
The hand. Check it out.

01:30.291 --> 01:31.625
All right, be ready.

01:31.659 --> 01:33.794
Never know what they can do.
Come on.

01:33.827 --> 01:35.363
Let's go see what he's up to.

01:38.532 --> 01:40.334
Hey.

01:40.368 --> 01:42.636
Want to tell us
what you're doing here?

01:42.670 --> 01:45.473
Waiting for a friend.
Is that against the law now?

01:45.506 --> 01:47.475
Let's see some ID.

01:47.508 --> 01:50.010
What's your problem, man?
I got rights.

01:50.043 --> 01:52.079
Are you refusing to comply?

01:52.112 --> 01:53.414
I haven't done anything wrong.

01:53.447 --> 01:55.416
Then you won't mind
showing some ID.

01:55.449 --> 01:57.185
-This is harassment...
-JACE: Whoa, what are you...?

01:57.218 --> 01:59.520
-(grunts)
-What are you doing, man?

01:59.553 --> 02:02.623
My job. He disobeyed
a lawful police order.

02:02.656 --> 02:04.292
Nah, he was just standing there.
You didn't have to do that.

02:04.325 --> 02:06.126
He made a move.

02:06.160 --> 02:08.095
Sir, the use of force guidelines
doesn't say anything...

02:08.128 --> 02:09.129
What? You think
he got a bad rap?

02:09.163 --> 02:10.464
You think I went in too hard?

02:10.498 --> 02:13.667
Let me tell you a story, rookie.

02:13.701 --> 02:16.637
A few years back, me and
my partner were on patrol.

02:16.670 --> 02:18.506
Pull a guy over
for a broken taillight.

02:18.539 --> 02:20.441
Mutie driver stuck him
with some kind of poison.

02:20.474 --> 02:22.142
He died in seconds.

02:22.176 --> 02:24.512
I tased this guy so I don't
have to tell your wife

02:24.545 --> 02:27.315
and your baby girl
that you died on my watch.

02:27.348 --> 02:29.016
So why don't you think
about that the next time

02:29.049 --> 02:30.984
you quote the rule book at me?

02:32.186 --> 02:33.554
Now get him up,

02:33.587 --> 02:35.589
on his feet, get him in the car.

02:37.225 --> 02:38.959
-(grunts)
-JACE: Spread your legs.

02:38.992 --> 02:41.529
(handcuffs clicking)

02:41.562 --> 02:43.564
(panting)

02:48.101 --> 02:50.938
Let's go.

03:01.249 --> 03:02.516
(door opens)

03:02.550 --> 03:05.319
-Caitlin!
-In here. How is she?

03:05.353 --> 03:07.655
She lost consciousness.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.156
We barely made it out of there.
The police showed up

03:09.189 --> 03:11.359
and patients were
running around everywhere.

03:11.392 --> 03:12.560
I got more mutants in the car
right now. One of them's

03:12.593 --> 03:14.295
-injured real bad.
-Go, go. We got Lauren.

03:15.463 --> 03:17.498
Okay, honey. Let me see you.

03:17.531 --> 03:20.000
-Open your eyes.
-(exhales)

03:20.033 --> 03:23.203
Her pupils are a little dilated.

03:23.237 --> 03:24.538
Lauren, do you know
what day it is?

03:24.572 --> 03:25.539
It's Tuesday.

03:25.573 --> 03:27.575
Any nausea? Dizziness?

03:27.608 --> 03:29.209
No. I'm fine.

03:29.243 --> 03:33.013
Okay. I-I think
it's just a mild concussion.

03:33.046 --> 03:36.417
-Thank God.
-Andy.

03:36.450 --> 03:39.219
I was trying...
I was trying to get him.

03:39.253 --> 03:41.889
I tried, but he...
he wouldn't listen to me.

03:41.922 --> 03:44.392
-Hey. It's okay, baby.
-No.

03:44.425 --> 03:45.726
-It's okay, baby.
-It's not okay, it's not okay.

03:45.759 --> 03:47.361
-I'm sorry.
-CAITLIN: No. No, honey.

03:47.395 --> 03:49.096
None of this is your fault.

03:49.129 --> 03:51.299
-Let me get her home.
Get her some rest.
-No, I-I...

03:51.332 --> 03:52.466
-I want to stay with her.
-WOMAN: Hey!

03:52.500 --> 03:54.602
We need another gurney
over here!

03:54.635 --> 03:57.037
You got your hands full here.
Let me take care of her.

03:57.070 --> 03:59.039
Mom, I'm okay.

03:59.072 --> 04:00.874
-Go.
-I love you.

04:00.908 --> 04:01.975
THUNDERBIRD:
Hey! I need some help!

04:02.009 --> 04:03.411
-Call me if she's feeling sick.
-Go.

04:03.444 --> 04:06.547
-It's okay, go.
-If anything changes...

04:06.580 --> 04:08.482
-Stand back.
-What happened?

04:08.516 --> 04:10.117
Uh, his body secretes
some kind of acid.

04:10.150 --> 04:12.252
Get the others in room two.
We need a doctor!

04:12.286 --> 04:14.254
-Aah!
-Here.

04:14.288 --> 04:15.823
Put him down here.

04:15.856 --> 04:18.926
(grunting)

04:18.959 --> 04:22.463
Be careful, don't touch him.
Your hands.

04:22.496 --> 04:24.064
I'm fine.

04:24.097 --> 04:25.766
We almost had Lauren and Andy.

04:25.799 --> 04:28.802
I still don't understand.

04:28.836 --> 04:30.504
How did you let Andy get away?

04:30.538 --> 04:32.740
It was chaos, all right?
We were trying to save patients,

04:32.773 --> 04:34.908
-deal with the cops.
-But you couldn't track him?

04:34.942 --> 04:36.944
Caitlin, there was
too much going on.

04:36.977 --> 04:39.112
All right?
The mutants using their powers,

04:39.146 --> 04:40.448
and the cops showed up
and the noise--

04:40.481 --> 04:41.615
it was sensory overload for me.

04:41.649 --> 04:43.283
I couldn't tell
one track from another.

04:43.317 --> 04:45.453
We were just so close. Lauren
got hurt, we didn't get Andy.

04:45.486 --> 04:47.287
We-we don't even know
who they took or why.

04:47.321 --> 04:49.357
We're not gonna give up.
We're gonna bring Andy home.

04:49.390 --> 04:50.658
Him and Lorna. I promise, okay?

04:50.691 --> 04:52.259
We just have to get ahead
of the Inner Circle.

04:52.292 --> 04:53.661
We have to figure out
what they're planning.

04:53.694 --> 04:56.497
-How?
-That man, he was
on the same floor

04:56.530 --> 04:58.866
as Andy and Lorna.
Maybe he can tell us something.

04:58.899 --> 05:01.335
If he makes it.

05:01.369 --> 05:04.672
Caitlin, I did
the best I could out there.

05:04.705 --> 05:06.273
All right? Please,

05:06.306 --> 05:08.141
let's just try and salvage
something from this.

05:08.175 --> 05:10.177
This can't have been
for nothing.

05:12.680 --> 05:15.849
NEWSMAN: It was a violent,
unprovoked attack

05:15.883 --> 05:19.453
that left the staff of Lynwood
Hospital beaten and bloodied.

05:19.487 --> 05:21.021
The people behind
today's attacks

05:21.054 --> 05:22.490
say they're freedom fighters.

05:22.523 --> 05:25.626
They released mentally unstable
violent mutants.

05:25.659 --> 05:27.294
Words matter, folks.

05:27.327 --> 05:32.332
Call this what it is:
mutant extremist terrorism.

05:32.366 --> 05:33.734
They take hostages,

05:33.767 --> 05:36.169
they force them to make
some bogus confession.

05:36.203 --> 05:37.304
-They are terrorists.
-(phone vibrating)

05:37.337 --> 05:40.207
And let's talk about
the so-called victims

05:40.240 --> 05:42.042
at the mental hospital.

05:42.075 --> 05:44.412
These people were
locked up for a reason.

05:44.445 --> 05:46.480
They're capable
of horrific violence

05:46.514 --> 05:48.015
and must not be allowed
to roam freely.

05:48.048 --> 05:49.883
-(laughs softly)
-We're talking about

05:49.917 --> 05:52.553
people who have committed
unspeakable acts,

05:52.586 --> 05:56.089
deemed unfit to live
among the general population.

05:56.123 --> 05:59.727
One of these guys
secretes acid from his skin.

05:59.760 --> 06:02.195
A powerful corrosive
that destroys anything

06:02.229 --> 06:04.364
-it comes into contact with.
-(typing)

06:04.398 --> 06:05.866
Does that sound like someone

06:05.899 --> 06:07.568
who should be
walking the streets?

06:07.601 --> 06:10.037
These people are fugitives.

06:10.070 --> 06:12.005
We need to track them down
and put them away

06:12.039 --> 06:16.276
before they hurt
or even kill innocent people.

06:16.309 --> 06:18.211
GLOW:
Everyone really appreciates

06:18.245 --> 06:20.213
you guys rescuing us
from the mental hospital,

06:20.247 --> 06:21.348
but they're all scared.

06:21.381 --> 06:22.716
They want to know
how we're gonna get away

06:22.750 --> 06:23.884
from Sentinel Services.

06:23.917 --> 06:25.419
What's your plan?

06:25.453 --> 06:26.687
Well, we're gonna get you
out of the city first.

06:26.720 --> 06:27.888
BLINK:
I checked the radio.

06:27.921 --> 06:29.356
Roadblocks everywhere,
we can't move.

06:29.389 --> 06:31.625
This is bad.
We can't keep this many here.

06:31.659 --> 06:33.527
We haven't got enough supplies,
we don't have anywhere

06:33.561 --> 06:37.064
-anyone can sleep...
-What about the Morlocks?

06:37.097 --> 06:39.099
-You're not serious.
-Who are they?

06:39.132 --> 06:40.768
Mutant group.
They live underground.

06:40.801 --> 06:41.902
Yeah, in the sewers.

06:41.935 --> 06:43.103
That's what air freshener's for.

06:43.136 --> 06:44.538
Do you prefer to get caught?

06:44.572 --> 06:46.239
Okay, Clarice,
John doesn't trust Erg.

06:46.273 --> 06:47.975
He helped us.
It may not be ideal,

06:48.008 --> 06:50.778
but it might be the only thing
to keep these people safe.

06:56.249 --> 06:58.619
A group claiming responsibility
for today's attack

06:58.652 --> 07:00.488
released the following
statement:

07:00.521 --> 07:03.223
"Mutants, our fate
is in our own hands,

07:03.256 --> 07:05.258
"and this is the tip
of the spear.

07:05.292 --> 07:07.495
It's time mutants must rise."

07:07.528 --> 07:09.963
The group, known only
by the hashtag #MutantUprising,

07:09.997 --> 07:12.833
has already inspired protests.

07:12.866 --> 07:14.735
Meanwhile,
civil rights advocates,

07:14.768 --> 07:16.003
while condemning the violence,

07:16.036 --> 07:17.771
noted that they have
long criticized...

07:17.805 --> 07:19.473
LAUREN:
Andy, I know you're scared.

07:19.507 --> 07:21.108
I'm not scared!

07:23.611 --> 07:26.179
Human rights organizations fear
today's attack

07:26.213 --> 07:28.181
will encourage other mutant
terrorist groups...

07:28.215 --> 07:31.284
It's... So, this is good?

07:32.385 --> 07:34.087
-After all we did?
-POLARIS: Andy.

07:34.121 --> 07:35.155
You had to do it.

07:35.188 --> 07:37.491
I hurt Lauren.

07:37.525 --> 07:39.593
-I could've killed her.
-But you didn't.

07:39.627 --> 07:41.428
You pushed just as hard
as you needed to

07:41.461 --> 07:42.429
to get us out of there.

07:42.462 --> 07:43.764
And look what we did.

07:43.797 --> 07:45.699
Andy, you should be proud.

07:45.733 --> 07:47.535
It was a total success.

07:47.568 --> 07:49.336
Not quite.

07:50.504 --> 07:52.540
We need to talk about our guest.

07:57.144 --> 07:58.612
She hasn't spoken
since she got here.

07:58.646 --> 08:00.113
It's a big problem.

08:00.147 --> 08:02.115
She's the key
to Reeva's next step.

08:02.149 --> 08:03.717
What did you guys expect?

08:03.751 --> 08:05.553
-She's been locked up for years.
-He's right.

08:05.586 --> 08:06.987
Imagine what's going on
in her head.

08:07.020 --> 08:08.956
We don't need to.

08:08.989 --> 08:12.392
We can see for ourselves.

08:15.428 --> 08:17.565
(distorted screaming)

08:17.598 --> 08:21.001
ORDERLY:
Tighter! Break her arm
if you have to.

08:21.034 --> 08:23.403
This will knock her out.

08:23.436 --> 08:26.473
Please! Please stop.
I can't see, I can't breathe...

08:26.506 --> 08:29.376
(gasping)

08:29.409 --> 08:31.044
That bad, huh?

08:31.078 --> 08:32.880
You have no idea.

08:41.755 --> 08:43.724
She's fine.

08:43.757 --> 08:45.192
We just got home.

08:45.225 --> 08:46.927
She's laying on the couch.

08:46.960 --> 08:49.262
She's tired, she's just
got a bit of a headache.

08:49.296 --> 08:51.098
Okay, give her some ibuprofen,

08:51.131 --> 08:52.666
and make sure
she stays hydrated.

08:52.700 --> 08:55.368
I will.
How's it going there?

08:55.402 --> 08:57.537
We talked to the other mutants
from the hospital.

08:57.571 --> 08:59.573
Nobody knows anything
about Andy.

08:59.607 --> 09:02.375
I was wrong to let her go.

09:02.409 --> 09:05.012
She did what she thought
she had to do.

09:05.045 --> 09:06.614
We could've lost both of them.

09:06.647 --> 09:08.716
Lauren could've been...

09:08.749 --> 09:11.952
-The most important thing
is she's okay.
-Please,

09:11.985 --> 09:13.553
just tell her I'm sorry.

09:13.587 --> 09:16.256
I will.
Don't you worry.

09:16.289 --> 09:18.291
Talk to you later.

09:19.559 --> 09:20.694
(hangs up)

09:20.728 --> 09:22.262
Your mom feels terrible.

09:22.295 --> 09:25.565
She blames herself
that you were there.

09:25.599 --> 09:26.867
I had to be there.

09:26.900 --> 09:30.103
He was just so... so strong.

09:30.137 --> 09:33.540
I just can't believe that
you looked him in the eye,

09:33.573 --> 09:38.045
told him you wanted him to come
home, and he attacked you.

09:38.078 --> 09:39.279
He believes.

09:39.312 --> 09:41.114
I could see it in his eyes.

09:41.148 --> 09:44.584
He wasn't gonna let
anything stop them.

09:47.520 --> 09:49.857
Not even me.

09:52.125 --> 09:54.094
(indistinct chatter)

09:58.498 --> 10:00.100
What's going on?

10:00.133 --> 10:01.802
They're testing her powers.

10:01.835 --> 10:02.970
What are they?

10:03.003 --> 10:05.238
You'll see.

10:05.272 --> 10:06.807
ESME:
Rebecca, look,

10:06.840 --> 10:09.309
I know you haven't used
your powers in a while,

10:09.342 --> 10:11.078
but we're gonna need you to try.

10:11.111 --> 10:14.648
We want to help other mutants,
like we helped you.

10:17.384 --> 10:19.987
Look, I was
in a mental hospital, too.

10:20.020 --> 10:21.588
They treat us like animals.

10:21.621 --> 10:23.791
That's what we're fighting.

10:23.824 --> 10:26.927
And you can be a weapon
in that fight.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.328
Don't you want to go
after mutant haters?

10:28.361 --> 10:30.530
We need you.

10:30.563 --> 10:32.165
We can't do this
without your help.

10:32.199 --> 10:34.501
Just show us what you can do.

10:36.236 --> 10:38.038
Rebecca?

10:48.581 --> 10:51.184
She may be too far gone.

10:51.218 --> 10:52.986
We just rescued her.
She needs time.

10:53.020 --> 10:54.688
We don't have time.

10:54.722 --> 10:57.057
Reeva's planned an operation
to cripple our enemies,

10:57.090 --> 10:59.026
but it doesn't happen
without Rebecca.

10:59.059 --> 11:00.627
Well, if she's so important,

11:00.660 --> 11:02.529
maybe Reeva should be here
working with her.

11:02.562 --> 11:04.164
She's not on vacation.

11:04.197 --> 11:05.833
She's laying the groundwork
for the next step in our plan,

11:05.866 --> 11:07.467
and she's depending on us.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.903
Do you want to tell Reeva
her new weapon is a dud?

11:09.937 --> 11:11.805
Maybe you should stop
calling her a weapon.

11:11.839 --> 11:13.006
I mean, she is a person.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.241
You could try treating her
like one.

11:14.274 --> 11:16.476
-Excuse me?
-Well, you cover her in wires,

11:16.509 --> 11:17.878
talk about her
like she's a thing.

11:17.911 --> 11:19.246
-I mean, what do you expect?
-Andy,

11:19.279 --> 11:20.981
I've seen what happens to people
who get locked up

11:21.014 --> 11:25.052
in those places, and sometimes
there's no coming back.

11:27.054 --> 11:29.022
Can I talk to her?

11:29.056 --> 11:30.891
You got nothing to lose.

11:33.794 --> 11:36.429
You know what,
knock yourself out.

11:41.401 --> 11:43.036
(whooshing)

11:45.906 --> 11:48.742
Come on, this way.

11:48.776 --> 11:50.177
(Eclipse scoffs)

11:50.210 --> 11:52.880
Doesn't John have
extra-powerful senses?

11:52.913 --> 11:55.082
How the hell did he stand
the smell down here?

11:55.115 --> 11:57.550
He breathed through his mouth.

11:57.584 --> 11:59.252
(coughs, spits)

11:59.286 --> 12:00.520
Now I can taste it.

12:00.553 --> 12:03.891
-It's not much farther.
-I don't get it.

12:03.924 --> 12:05.793
John said you were wandering
around here for hours

12:05.826 --> 12:07.260
when you came down before.

12:07.294 --> 12:08.528
How'd you know where to go?

12:08.561 --> 12:10.263
I don't know, I just guessed.

12:10.297 --> 12:12.766
And there's, like, no light
down here to absorb, either.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.567
If I use up all my energy,
I'm not gonna be able to fight.

12:14.601 --> 12:15.568
You know that, right?

12:15.602 --> 12:17.737
GLOW:
Um...

12:17.771 --> 12:19.306
maybe I can help.

12:43.163 --> 12:46.934
Huh. Want something done right,
ask a woman.

12:46.967 --> 12:49.669
Great. How do we find
these people?

12:49.702 --> 12:51.972
ERG:
You don't. We find you.

12:59.179 --> 13:02.582
Hey. I, uh...

13:02.615 --> 13:04.617
I need to talk to you
about something.

13:08.288 --> 13:10.423
I can't stop the bleeding.

13:10.457 --> 13:11.791
The acid keeps eating
through the gauze.

13:11.825 --> 13:13.426
I'm stitching as fast as I can.

13:13.460 --> 13:15.295
The wire is a lot harder
to work with than thread.

13:15.328 --> 13:16.796
(acid sizzles)

13:16.830 --> 13:18.832
(groaning)

13:18.866 --> 13:19.900
What's happening?

13:24.737 --> 13:26.273
Decreased breath sounds,
left side.

13:26.306 --> 13:28.141
-He's got a tension
pneumothorax.
-What's that?

13:28.175 --> 13:31.044
Air in his chest cavity.
His lung must be damaged.

13:31.078 --> 13:33.013
-Go! Do something!
-I can't do

13:33.046 --> 13:34.481
a needle decompression
if I can't touch him.

13:34.514 --> 13:36.884
-(gasps)
-Give me the needle!
I'll do it.

13:36.917 --> 13:38.451
-John, you can't.
-Just tell me what to do!

13:38.485 --> 13:39.987
-The acid.
-I'm not gonna let him die!

13:40.020 --> 13:42.022
-Give me the damn needle.
-(gasping)

13:42.055 --> 13:45.025
Between the second
and the third ribs.

13:45.058 --> 13:46.894
Lower.

13:46.927 --> 13:48.361
-Right there?
-Yeah.

13:48.395 --> 13:50.898
(sizzling)

13:50.931 --> 13:52.900
(shouts)
How-how deep?

13:52.933 --> 13:54.134
Until you hear a hiss of air.

13:54.167 --> 13:56.536
(groaning)

13:56.569 --> 13:58.705
(air hissing)

13:58.738 --> 14:01.008
-There.
-(shouts)

14:04.444 --> 14:07.714
He's out of the woods.
For now.

14:07.747 --> 14:09.716
-John, let me
take a look at you.
-No.

14:09.749 --> 14:11.384
Just get him talking.
We need answers.

14:20.293 --> 14:22.262
We gave him some flumenazil
to wake him up.

14:22.295 --> 14:23.763
It shouldn't be long.

14:25.899 --> 14:28.735
Can I please do this now?

14:35.909 --> 14:37.210
(sighs)

14:39.212 --> 14:41.581
I've never seen you like this.

14:41.614 --> 14:44.684
It's okay.

14:44.717 --> 14:46.053
My body is denser than normal.

14:46.086 --> 14:47.620
I damage less, heal faster.

14:47.654 --> 14:49.822
I don't need a lesson
in mutant medicine.

14:51.458 --> 14:53.726
I'm asking about you.

14:55.996 --> 14:57.630
I keep screwing up.

14:57.664 --> 14:59.866
I lost the Atlanta station.

14:59.899 --> 15:01.101
I lost Andy and Lorna.

15:01.134 --> 15:02.602
And when we found out about
the mental hospital,

15:02.635 --> 15:03.636
I thought that-that...

15:03.670 --> 15:05.305
What?

15:05.338 --> 15:07.207
That you could redeem yourself?

15:07.240 --> 15:09.309
Listen, what I said earlier--

15:09.342 --> 15:12.045
that wasn't fair.

15:12.079 --> 15:14.714
-This isn't your fault.
-It...

15:14.747 --> 15:16.149
No, it's not, none of it.

15:16.183 --> 15:18.318
I sent you out there.
We weren't prepared.

15:18.351 --> 15:19.652
I should've done more.

15:19.686 --> 15:20.687
(Michael straining)

15:23.656 --> 15:24.824
Where am I?

15:24.857 --> 15:26.293
You're okay.
You're in a clinic.

15:26.326 --> 15:27.995
I remember you.

15:28.028 --> 15:30.463
-You saved me.
-Yeah. What's your name?

15:30.497 --> 15:32.765
Michael.

15:32.799 --> 15:34.467
You served?

15:34.501 --> 15:36.936
Marines. Two tours, yeah.

15:36.970 --> 15:38.972
Me too.

15:39.006 --> 15:41.474
82nd Airborne, Mutant Corps.

15:41.508 --> 15:43.910
When that was a thing.

15:43.943 --> 15:46.579
Michael. Michael, I hate
to ask you this right now,

15:46.613 --> 15:48.081
but we have some questions
about the hospital.

15:48.115 --> 15:50.283
-Is that okay?
-Yeah.

15:50.317 --> 15:52.752
The people behind the attack,
they took someone from the room

15:52.785 --> 15:55.188
two doors down from yours;
do you know who it was?

15:56.856 --> 15:58.958
I think her name was Rebecca.

15:58.992 --> 16:00.327
Do you know anything else?

16:00.360 --> 16:02.195
Where she's from?
What she can do?

16:02.229 --> 16:06.033
We were down there because
collars didn't work on us.

16:06.066 --> 16:08.268
Acid ate through mine.

16:08.301 --> 16:11.804
All I know is they kept her
locked up tighter than anyone.

16:11.838 --> 16:13.706
Drugged her.
Never let her out.

16:13.740 --> 16:16.676
Even the shrink felt bad
about it.

16:16.709 --> 16:18.445
A psychiatrist?

16:18.478 --> 16:21.381
Her name was Dr. Taylor,
I think.

16:21.414 --> 16:23.050
She was kind to us.

16:23.083 --> 16:25.352
Said we didn't belong there.

16:25.385 --> 16:29.556
But she... but she...

16:34.361 --> 16:36.629
(sizzles)

16:36.663 --> 16:38.831
Breath sounds are shallow.

16:38.865 --> 16:42.669
I-I think that's all we're
gonna get for now.

16:46.439 --> 16:49.142
(water splashing)

16:49.176 --> 16:50.243
You all right?

16:50.277 --> 16:52.179
Yeah.

16:52.212 --> 16:54.247
Some of us are wondering
what happened

16:54.281 --> 16:56.883
at the mental hospital,
about the ones who released us.

16:56.916 --> 17:00.320
Okay, um...

17:00.353 --> 17:02.055
I don't know much.

17:02.089 --> 17:04.691
But they're called
the Inner Circle,

17:04.724 --> 17:07.327
and they say that they're
building something

17:07.360 --> 17:08.995
to "help all the mutants."

17:09.028 --> 17:11.564
You say that like
it's a bad thing.

17:11.598 --> 17:14.567
Yeah, well,
Hitler had big dreams, too.

17:14.601 --> 17:16.403
They recruited my, uh...

17:16.436 --> 17:18.505
(chuckles)

17:18.538 --> 17:22.409
...my kid's mom.

17:22.442 --> 17:24.411
My baby girl's with them.

17:24.444 --> 17:26.913
I'm sorry.

17:26.946 --> 17:29.682
But they can't be
all bad, right?

17:29.716 --> 17:32.952
I mean, they freed us, so...

17:32.985 --> 17:35.555
I don't know, I just try to
see the good wherever I can.

17:35.588 --> 17:38.057
Weren't you locked up in that
horrible place for years?

17:38.091 --> 17:41.794
It was hard, yeah.

17:41.828 --> 17:43.896
But there were always
little things.

17:43.930 --> 17:46.866
-Sometimes we'd get Jell-O.
-Jell-O?

17:46.899 --> 17:48.635
(chuckles)

17:54.974 --> 17:57.110
There's always a bit of light,

17:57.144 --> 17:59.846
even in the darkest places.

18:02.782 --> 18:04.784
You said you wanted to meet.

18:04.817 --> 18:06.619
You didn't mention any of this.

18:06.653 --> 18:08.755
You strong-armed me
into being your spy.

18:08.788 --> 18:10.923
You wanted information. Here.

18:10.957 --> 18:12.892
A list of mutants we've helped
through the Underground,

18:12.925 --> 18:13.960
and their powers.

18:13.993 --> 18:16.496
Our deal did not include
taking in refugees

18:16.529 --> 18:17.964
from a mental hospital.

18:17.997 --> 18:19.399
They have nowhere else to go.

18:19.432 --> 18:20.800
Oh, I guess you only care
about people

18:20.833 --> 18:22.402
that can do something for you.

18:22.435 --> 18:24.070
You sound just like
the Inner Circle.

18:24.103 --> 18:27.474
We are nothing like them.
This is a community.

18:27.507 --> 18:28.775
I protect these people.

18:28.808 --> 18:31.444
Exactly. You claim to be
some mutant savior,

18:31.478 --> 18:33.813
then do some freaking saving!

18:33.846 --> 18:37.484
Those refugees out there,
they need you.

18:37.517 --> 18:39.852
(scoffs)

18:39.886 --> 18:42.322
Please.

18:42.355 --> 18:47.093
All right, I'll take them.

18:47.126 --> 18:49.862
But first,
you're going to help me.

18:55.902 --> 18:57.304
Hey.

18:57.337 --> 18:59.539
I just figured
you might want some company.

18:59.572 --> 19:02.609
You probably haven't talked
to anybody in, like,

19:02.642 --> 19:04.143
a long time.

19:04.177 --> 19:07.847
That place you were in
was pretty messed up.

19:09.816 --> 19:12.552
Or, I mean, it's cool.
I could just

19:12.585 --> 19:14.887
hang out, too.

19:14.921 --> 19:16.656
(clears throat)

19:18.391 --> 19:20.227
They didn't actually tell me
what your power was.

19:20.260 --> 19:22.329
They just said that
they needed you.

19:22.362 --> 19:25.164
They need me, too, 'cause...

19:28.067 --> 19:30.069
(laughs softly)

19:37.043 --> 19:40.247
Must have sucked
being stuck all alone.

19:40.280 --> 19:42.549
All those people treating you
like crap every day.

19:42.582 --> 19:45.485
It's kind of like high school.
This place is better, though.

19:45.518 --> 19:47.654
Even if you're still
kind of alone,

19:47.687 --> 19:49.889
at least you don't have to
apologize for just

19:49.922 --> 19:51.691
being who you are, you know?

19:53.426 --> 19:56.028
That's kind of how it was
with my family.

19:56.062 --> 19:58.365
I tried to explain,
but they just didn't get it.

19:58.398 --> 20:01.568
My sister, she just...

20:01.601 --> 20:03.736
she wouldn't listen.

20:03.770 --> 20:07.707
But, you know, this place is
kind of like my new family.

20:07.740 --> 20:10.076
You can be part of that, too,

20:10.109 --> 20:12.144
if... if you want.

20:27.159 --> 20:29.195
Inside out, huh?

20:29.228 --> 20:31.564
My name is Andy.

20:31.598 --> 20:34.567
Rebecca.

20:34.601 --> 20:36.803
(laughs softly)

20:40.740 --> 20:42.609
WILSON:
It's gonna be great.

20:42.642 --> 20:44.043
Jace!

20:44.076 --> 20:46.746
-Hey.
-Glad you made it.

20:46.779 --> 20:48.080
Good to see you.

20:48.114 --> 20:50.917
-Hey, I'm Kyle.
-Jace. Nice to meet you.

20:50.950 --> 20:53.653
Yeah, you, too. Wilson said you
worked Sentinel Services?

20:53.686 --> 20:55.422
I did. I did.

20:55.455 --> 20:57.757
He said you guys were doing
some good work here.

20:57.790 --> 20:58.925
I thought I'd
check it out myself.

20:58.958 --> 21:01.394
Hey, why don't you grab
a cup of coffee.

21:01.428 --> 21:02.629
We'll get started
in a few minutes.

21:02.662 --> 21:04.364
All right.

21:07.867 --> 21:09.302
WILSON:
Listen, I know we're all upset

21:09.336 --> 21:10.803
about what happened today.

21:10.837 --> 21:13.806
We saw a mutant
terrorist attack on our soil

21:13.840 --> 21:16.576
like we haven't seen since 7/15.

21:16.609 --> 21:19.446
Thousands of people
cheering the terrorists on.

21:19.479 --> 21:21.481
We all saw the protests
on the news, huh?

21:21.514 --> 21:24.951
Word is they hit the streets
here tomorrow.

21:24.984 --> 21:27.754
Well, we are going
to be waiting for them.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.489
-Yes.
-We are gonna push back.

21:29.522 --> 21:30.957
-That's right.
-Yeah!

21:30.990 --> 21:32.992
Our job? Send a message.

21:33.025 --> 21:36.596
-They will not replace us.
-No, they will not.

21:36.629 --> 21:38.498
We are gonna meet them
in the streets, one-on-one.

21:38.531 --> 21:40.333
-That's right.
-(shouts of agreement)

21:40.367 --> 21:42.402
Jace?

21:44.471 --> 21:46.673
Look, I know
I'm just a guest here,

21:46.706 --> 21:48.608
but fighting
with protestors, it's...

21:48.641 --> 21:50.276
it's just gonna make the mutants
look like victims.

21:50.309 --> 21:52.278
Somebody films it?
The video goes viral,

21:52.311 --> 21:53.946
you end up looking
just as bad as them.

21:53.980 --> 21:55.348
Now, you got a lot
of manpower here.

21:55.382 --> 21:57.517
If you really wanted to,
you could,

21:57.550 --> 21:58.885
you could make a difference.

21:58.918 --> 22:01.454
And what do you mean, exactly?

22:01.488 --> 22:02.889
Well, the mutants that escaped
from the mental hospital

22:02.922 --> 22:04.991
are fugitives.

22:05.024 --> 22:07.026
How about helping
to round them up?

22:07.059 --> 22:08.395
Isn't that
Sentinel Services' job?

22:08.428 --> 22:10.162
Sentinel Services' job is
to cover their own asses,

22:10.196 --> 22:11.698
-believe me.
-(laughter)

22:11.731 --> 22:13.032
The mutants that escaped
from the mental hospital

22:13.065 --> 22:14.166
are dangerous.

22:14.200 --> 22:15.968
Somebody needs to get them
off the streets.

22:16.002 --> 22:17.136
How do we do that?

22:17.169 --> 22:20.339
Well...

22:20.373 --> 22:22.709
on the news, it said that
some of them were injured.

22:22.742 --> 22:24.411
They're gonna be looking
for a place to get treated.

22:24.444 --> 22:26.813
You go to all the mutant-
friendly clinics, hospitals.

22:26.846 --> 22:30.817
You find the fugitives, you turn
them in and you show everybody

22:30.850 --> 22:32.919
that the Purifiers
are part of the solution.

22:32.952 --> 22:36.656
-(crowd murmuring)
-You really think that'll work?

22:36.689 --> 22:38.257
I don't think it will.

22:38.290 --> 22:40.192
I know it will.

22:45.698 --> 22:48.401
This is where
everyone hangs out.

22:48.435 --> 22:50.336
Kind of looks like
a modern art museum,

22:50.369 --> 22:51.771
but this place is pretty dope.

22:51.804 --> 22:53.406
You can get basically
whatever you want.

22:53.440 --> 22:55.241
Coffee, snacks.

22:55.274 --> 22:58.578
Chef makes a mean
bacon cheeseburger.

22:58.611 --> 23:01.047
They got every video game
I can think of.

23:07.454 --> 23:09.722
Oh, yeah.

23:09.756 --> 23:12.625
That place you were locked up
didn't have any windows, huh?

23:15.828 --> 23:18.798
I forgot how beautiful
the sky could be.

23:18.831 --> 23:21.133
Must've been tough being trapped
in a hole for so long.

23:23.069 --> 23:25.605
Now I'm trapped here.

23:25.638 --> 23:27.974
Trapped? We can go out
anytime we want.

23:28.007 --> 23:30.943
In this?

23:30.977 --> 23:34.146
Yeah, I'll get the helpers
to get you some normal clothes.

23:34.180 --> 23:37.850
What do you say?
Do you want to get out of here?

23:42.088 --> 23:44.757
Yeah.

23:44.791 --> 23:47.259
I'd like that.

23:47.293 --> 23:49.796
Cool.

23:53.500 --> 23:55.067
-Hey.
-Hey.

23:55.101 --> 23:58.437
Wow. You look amazing.

23:58.471 --> 24:00.106
Yeah, I feel a little bougie,
but I guess...

24:00.139 --> 24:01.140
No, it's perfect.

24:01.173 --> 24:02.675
-Want to go?
-Uh-huh.

24:07.346 --> 24:08.648
Going somewhere?

24:08.681 --> 24:11.250
Yeah, we were just gonna
go get something to eat.

24:11.283 --> 24:12.919
The chef can make
whatever you want.

24:12.952 --> 24:15.688
Well, she hasn't been outside
in, like... like, how long?

24:15.722 --> 24:17.924
I don't know. Over a year?

24:17.957 --> 24:21.260
Andy, can I talk to you a sec?

24:21.293 --> 24:23.329
Sorry.

24:25.297 --> 24:26.999
What's up?

24:27.033 --> 24:29.101
Look, I think it's great that
you got her out of her shell,

24:29.135 --> 24:31.671
but, uh, taking her outside?

24:31.704 --> 24:32.972
She needs this.

24:33.005 --> 24:34.373
Andy, I was in one
of those places.

24:34.406 --> 24:35.975
When you leave,
it takes time to adjust.

24:36.008 --> 24:37.309
Okay? You can't just...

24:37.343 --> 24:39.345
Hey, you want her to fight
for our freedom, right?

24:39.378 --> 24:40.713
But what about her freedom?

24:40.747 --> 24:42.081
Is she allowed to have it?

24:45.918 --> 24:47.887
Be careful.

24:47.920 --> 24:51.991
Okay. All right.

25:05.572 --> 25:07.907
BLINK:
So what is this favor
I'm doing for you?

25:07.940 --> 25:12.044
It's better to show you.
It's just a little farther.

25:12.078 --> 25:15.314
So what's up
with the eye patch?

25:15.347 --> 25:19.085
You get the wrong end
of a sharp stick?

25:19.118 --> 25:21.554
I lost my eye when
I manifested as a teenager.

25:21.588 --> 25:23.422
Some kids were beating me up
when it happened.

25:23.455 --> 25:24.891
Well, why were they
beating you up

25:24.924 --> 25:26.693
if they didn't know
you were a mutant?

25:26.726 --> 25:30.496
They weren't mutant haters,
just good old-fashioned racists.

25:30.529 --> 25:32.364
Anyway, I discovered
I could absorb

25:32.398 --> 25:35.702
and redirect energy
through this.

25:38.771 --> 25:40.740
And what if no one attacks you?

25:40.773 --> 25:42.575
Then I've got nothing
to throw back at them.

25:42.609 --> 25:45.712
All we want is to be left alone.

25:45.745 --> 25:48.280
It's this way.

25:53.419 --> 25:55.121
Here.

25:55.154 --> 25:56.756
What's here?

25:56.789 --> 25:59.025
I need you to use your abilities
to take us up there.

25:59.058 --> 26:00.526
About 50 feet up.

26:00.559 --> 26:01.761
Okay, listen.

26:01.794 --> 26:03.730
If you're using me
to get some sort of weapon

26:03.763 --> 26:05.632
-or something shady
like that, I'm not...
-Clarice.

26:05.665 --> 26:08.901
I think by now you know
what kind of man I am.

26:26.452 --> 26:29.088
-Why are we here?
-We're gathering supplies.

26:29.121 --> 26:30.790
Canned food, baby formula.

26:30.823 --> 26:32.391
Normally, we send groups
out on the surface

26:32.424 --> 26:34.827
to take what we need.
It's dangerous work.

26:34.861 --> 26:36.162
I figured you brought us
more mouths to feed.

26:36.195 --> 26:37.229
You can help us feed them.

26:37.263 --> 26:38.464
Great.

26:38.497 --> 26:39.799
Is there a problem?

26:39.832 --> 26:41.000
Yeah, we don't steal
from people.

26:41.033 --> 26:43.135
John says it makes it harder
for mutants everywhere.

26:43.169 --> 26:45.104
-Is that what John says?
-And he's not wrong.

26:45.137 --> 26:47.273
Trust me. I used to be a thief.

26:47.306 --> 26:49.475
Stealing from people
kind of makes them hate you.

26:49.508 --> 26:51.077
They already hate us.

26:51.110 --> 26:53.079
What I think your boyfriend
doesn't understand

26:53.112 --> 26:54.914
is I don't need
the humans' love.

26:54.947 --> 26:56.148
I don't care about their hate.

26:56.182 --> 26:57.950
So what are you fighting for?

26:57.984 --> 27:00.286
We're not interested
in some grand symbolic struggle.

27:00.319 --> 27:02.689
The Inner Circle's
war with humans?

27:02.722 --> 27:04.857
Just a recipe
for senseless slaughter.

27:04.891 --> 27:06.258
And the Mutant Underground's

27:06.292 --> 27:08.828
fight for some pipe dream
of coexistence is almost as bad.

27:08.861 --> 27:10.562
I don't believe in dreams.

27:12.865 --> 27:15.968
I believe in Corn Flakes.

27:18.470 --> 27:21.173
-How's he doing?
-A little better.

27:21.207 --> 27:23.275
Replacing the needle
bought us some time,

27:23.309 --> 27:25.211
but he might need surgery.

27:25.244 --> 27:27.013
In a situation like this...

27:27.046 --> 27:28.715
What is it?

27:28.748 --> 27:31.350
(overlapping chatter)

27:31.383 --> 27:33.820
-NURSE: What are you doing here?
-Looking for fugitives.

27:33.853 --> 27:36.689
This is a medical facility.
You can't just come in here...

27:36.723 --> 27:38.524
Someone's here.

27:38.557 --> 27:40.960
A group. I think
it might be Purifiers.

27:40.993 --> 27:42.729
We got to get all the mutant
patients and hide them now.

27:42.762 --> 27:45.064
Here. Grab that blanket. We'll
put him in the secret room.

27:45.097 --> 27:46.232
-(grunting)
-(sizzling)

27:46.265 --> 27:47.867
KYLE: I'm sorry.
Is there something wrong

27:47.900 --> 27:49.235
with your hearing?
I said open the door.

27:49.268 --> 27:50.870
You need to leave now
or I'm gonna call the police.

27:50.903 --> 27:53.539
I said open the damn door.

27:55.174 --> 27:56.442
Here.

28:00.046 --> 28:01.748
Everybody stay quiet.

28:01.781 --> 28:03.783
-(grunting)
-(sizzling)

28:11.190 --> 28:13.259
JACE:
Ma'am. Hey, listen to me.

28:13.292 --> 28:14.660
We don't want to hurt anybody.

28:14.693 --> 28:17.329
Okay? We need to search
the clinic for fugitives.

28:17.363 --> 28:19.598
So, please, let us in.

28:22.301 --> 28:23.535
-No!
-MAN: All right, let's go.

28:23.569 --> 28:25.204
NURSE:
No!

28:25.237 --> 28:27.039
MAN:
Come on, we'll find 'em.

28:27.073 --> 28:28.474
(overlapping chatter)

28:30.576 --> 28:32.111
Isn't that...?

28:33.245 --> 28:36.615
Jace Turner
from Sentinel Services.

28:36.648 --> 28:38.851
Well, he's not
with them anymore.

28:38.885 --> 28:40.219
CAITLIN:
He can't know we're here.

29:02.942 --> 29:05.244
I'm sure they'll be back soon.

29:05.277 --> 29:06.712
No, we shouldn't have come here.

29:06.745 --> 29:08.680
Look at this place.

29:11.517 --> 29:15.054
I know it's hard to believe,
but after a few years

29:15.087 --> 29:17.323
at the mental hospital,
this isn't that bad.

29:20.459 --> 29:22.294
How did you end up in there?

29:23.863 --> 29:26.598
I was... at a concert.

29:28.600 --> 29:32.939
I was having fun
and I wasn't thinking and...

29:32.972 --> 29:34.673
I started dancing.

29:34.706 --> 29:38.477
I just created these orbs.

29:38.510 --> 29:39.912
People panicked.

29:39.946 --> 29:43.950
I was charged
with inciting a riot.

29:43.983 --> 29:45.985
At the trial, though,
one juror wouldn't convict me

29:46.018 --> 29:48.087
'cause the lights
aren't dangerous,

29:48.120 --> 29:49.755
so they tried something else.

29:49.788 --> 29:51.858
Diagnosed me
with a manic disorder

29:51.891 --> 29:55.761
and they sent me
to the mental hospital.

29:55.794 --> 29:58.430
Doctors told me
I'd never be cured.

29:58.464 --> 30:01.500
(scoffs)

30:01.533 --> 30:04.937
I would have been so, so angry.

30:04.971 --> 30:08.074
I was.

30:11.844 --> 30:14.680
But you know...
(sniffles)

30:14.713 --> 30:18.717
eventually, I realized
I could forgive them

30:18.750 --> 30:21.353
or I could spend
the rest of my life angry.

30:22.889 --> 30:24.756
So I forgave them.

30:27.526 --> 30:29.161
I don't think I could do that.

30:29.195 --> 30:31.730
Don't underestimate yourself.

30:31.763 --> 30:33.332
BLINK:
Hey.

30:36.202 --> 30:37.636
Clarice, where the hell
have you been?

30:37.669 --> 30:40.406
Just talking with Erg.

30:40.439 --> 30:42.508
And? Can they stay?

30:42.541 --> 30:44.210
Yes.

30:44.243 --> 30:46.778
But he wants to talk
with everyone first.

30:49.281 --> 30:51.217
You've seen our society.

30:51.250 --> 30:52.818
Here, all mutants are free

30:52.851 --> 30:55.154
to live without hate,
judgment or persecution--

30:55.187 --> 30:58.324
an oasis where your powers
are not only accepted,

30:58.357 --> 31:00.259
but celebrated.

31:00.292 --> 31:04.096
You are welcome to stay here
on one condition.

31:04.130 --> 31:07.533
Those of you who choose
to remain with us

31:07.566 --> 31:09.668
must take the mark.

31:09.701 --> 31:11.904
ECLIPSE:
Whoa, wait. Hold on.

31:11.938 --> 31:13.272
These people need your help.

31:13.305 --> 31:15.074
You're asking them
to mutilate themselves?

31:15.107 --> 31:17.009
Those who have visible
mutations are exempt.

31:17.043 --> 31:18.110
-(scoffs)
-Down here,

31:18.144 --> 31:19.545
we embrace our mutant nature.

31:19.578 --> 31:20.846
We do not hide it.

31:20.879 --> 31:22.514
This is a mark of pride.

31:22.548 --> 31:24.683
Then print a big "M"
on their shirts or something,

31:24.716 --> 31:25.884
but burning their faces
is completely different.

31:25.918 --> 31:27.954
Marcos, please.

31:27.987 --> 31:29.721
It's their house, their rules.

31:29.755 --> 31:31.090
How can you be okay
with doing this?

31:31.123 --> 31:32.358
What other choice do we have?

31:32.391 --> 31:34.961
Hey. It's all right.

31:34.994 --> 31:37.763
-You don't have to do this.
-We don't have a home.

31:39.431 --> 31:41.067
We'll take the brand.

31:54.413 --> 31:56.548
-What?
-Nothing. I've just never seen

31:56.582 --> 31:58.917
-somebody eat a burger
that fast before.
-Sorry.

31:58.951 --> 32:00.652
-It's been a while. (chuckles)
-It's cool.

32:00.686 --> 32:02.821
I hate it when girls eat,
like, salads and stuff.

32:08.760 --> 32:11.330
You want my shake?
It's all yours.

32:12.631 --> 32:14.666
So that thing you did
with the tennis ball--

32:14.700 --> 32:17.536
do you, like, turn stuff
inside out or something?

32:26.878 --> 32:29.348
That-That's incredible.
That's crazy.

32:29.381 --> 32:30.582
How does that work?

32:30.616 --> 32:34.020
Most people can move things
up, down, sideways.

32:34.053 --> 32:36.788
For me, there's
another direction.

32:36.822 --> 32:39.758
I just kind of
twist things that way.

32:39.791 --> 32:42.694
Turn them around.

32:42.728 --> 32:44.263
Upside down.

32:44.296 --> 32:46.398
Inside out.

33:05.384 --> 33:08.020
That... that's awesome.

33:08.054 --> 33:09.555
(laughs)

33:09.588 --> 33:11.457
Look, I...

33:11.490 --> 33:14.193
I know they were
pushing you around

33:14.226 --> 33:16.662
in the training room.
Look, I just want you to know

33:16.695 --> 33:17.996
we're actually trying
to do something good.

33:18.030 --> 33:19.398
We're trying to build
a place for mutants.

33:19.431 --> 33:21.633
Like a-a new homeland
where you don't have to...

33:21.667 --> 33:23.869
Dude, you can skip
the sales pitch.

33:25.371 --> 33:27.473
You had me at milkshake.

33:27.506 --> 33:29.175
(laughs softly)

33:35.381 --> 33:36.548
Check it out.

33:37.683 --> 33:39.718
You want to have some fun?

33:39.751 --> 33:41.387
Come on.

33:49.361 --> 33:52.898
What-what are we doing, exactly?

34:03.275 --> 34:04.743
What the hell?

34:11.317 --> 34:13.285
2564, requesting assistance.

34:13.319 --> 34:15.587
Are you crazy? Those are cops.

34:15.621 --> 34:17.856
I know. I hate cops.

34:17.889 --> 34:19.558
Now you.

34:19.591 --> 34:21.059
-No.
-Come on. I showed you mine.

34:37.643 --> 34:40.246
(laughs) Okay, that?

34:40.279 --> 34:42.781
-Freaking awesome.
-Yeah, let's go.

34:45.984 --> 34:47.119
KYLE:
Jace!

34:48.454 --> 34:50.622
Look what I found.

34:51.990 --> 34:54.260
Where are the patients?

34:54.293 --> 34:56.162
I told you,
we don't have any now.

34:56.195 --> 34:58.197
Really? What happened in there?

35:00.932 --> 35:03.101
It was-it was just an accident.

35:03.135 --> 35:05.804
-Nurse spilled some chemicals.
-Is that right?

35:05.837 --> 35:07.673
'Cause on the news it said
that one of the escaped mutants

35:07.706 --> 35:10.108
-secretes some type of acid.
-Looks about right to me.

35:11.277 --> 35:12.711
Where is he?

35:17.983 --> 35:19.685
I don't know
what you're talking about.

35:19.718 --> 35:21.620
-Doctor, you're lying to us.
-No, I'm not.

35:21.653 --> 35:24.290
Hey, I'll get it
out of him, all right?

35:25.557 --> 35:27.025
-(coughs)
-(woman screams)

35:27.058 --> 35:28.927
(grunts)

35:28.960 --> 35:31.163
-John.
-Caitlin, I have to.

35:31.197 --> 35:33.265
No, you can't.
He thinks we're all dead.

35:33.299 --> 35:34.266
If he finds out we're here,

35:34.300 --> 35:35.867
do you have any idea
what that means?

35:35.901 --> 35:38.270
-I can't just do nothing.
Come on.
-This isn't about you.

35:38.304 --> 35:40.606
It's about all of us,
the whole Mutant Underground.

35:40.639 --> 35:43.709
People need us,
now more than ever.

35:43.742 --> 35:44.876
(Michael whimpers)

35:44.910 --> 35:47.012
What's wrong?

35:47.045 --> 35:49.281
Damn it. The acid ate
through another needle.

35:49.315 --> 35:51.483
We got to get him
to a hospital, all right?

35:51.517 --> 35:54.720
-That's why I have to
go out there.
-And do what? Kill them all?

35:54.753 --> 35:56.822
A bunch of Purifiers
get slaughtered

35:56.855 --> 35:59.057
in a mutant-friendly clinic,
and then what?

35:59.090 --> 36:00.359
This place is gone.

36:00.392 --> 36:02.228
(coughing)

36:05.063 --> 36:07.366
Listen to her.
Mission comes first, brother.

36:07.399 --> 36:10.969
-I'm not gonna let you die.
-I'm tough.

36:11.002 --> 36:13.405
I'll be okay. Tell him.

36:15.241 --> 36:16.742
Can he hold out?

36:19.445 --> 36:20.879
Uh...

36:26.585 --> 36:28.220
Tell him.

36:35.227 --> 36:38.129
His lung function's better.
I think he'll make it.

36:50.776 --> 36:52.978
MAN:
Open that one!
Come on, let's go!

36:58.250 --> 37:01.453
Tell me, where are the mutants?

37:01.487 --> 37:03.355
Please...

37:03.389 --> 37:05.924
I told you, I don't know.

37:05.957 --> 37:07.058
Hey, hey!

37:07.092 --> 37:08.727
That's enough, man.
What are you doing?

37:08.760 --> 37:10.796
KYLE:
That man is a traitor
to his species.

37:10.829 --> 37:12.264
I say we take him
out back and...

37:12.298 --> 37:13.432
(sirens approaching)

37:13.465 --> 37:16.768
-(coughs)
-We got to go. We got to go now.

37:16.802 --> 37:18.604
Let's go. Everybody out.

37:20.772 --> 37:21.973
They're leaving.

37:22.007 --> 37:24.310
We got to get him ready.
Take him to the hospital.

37:26.244 --> 37:28.580
No.

37:28.614 --> 37:31.350
I'm sorry, John.
The damage was too great.

37:33.184 --> 37:34.386
You knew.

37:34.420 --> 37:37.623
You knew he wouldn't make it.

37:37.656 --> 37:39.891
He knew it, too.

37:39.925 --> 37:41.960
-You lied to me!
-I'm sorry, John.

37:41.993 --> 37:44.730
It was the only option.
Michael understood that.

37:44.763 --> 37:46.498
(shouts)

37:46.532 --> 37:47.799
(grunts)

37:47.833 --> 37:52.270
Hey. Hey.
He told us about Rebecca.

37:52.304 --> 37:55.641
Maybe we can get to the shrink
and find out more.

37:55.674 --> 37:59.611
It wasn't all for nothing, John.

37:59.645 --> 38:01.279
It wasn't.

38:02.981 --> 38:04.316
(indistinct conversations)

38:13.359 --> 38:16.027
-You're still here.
-We're, uh...

38:16.061 --> 38:19.097
sticking around until... after.

38:19.130 --> 38:22.033
-In case anyone
changes their mind.
-They won't.

38:22.067 --> 38:23.835
You're confident, aren't you?

38:23.869 --> 38:25.537
People want to belong
to something.

38:25.571 --> 38:27.005
We give them that.

38:27.038 --> 38:30.476
-Don't you want that, too?
-I'm happy where I am.

38:30.509 --> 38:31.843
Are you?

38:31.877 --> 38:35.280
You hide yourself up there,
for them.

38:35.313 --> 38:38.484
Contact lenses, covering
your ears, your markings.

38:38.517 --> 38:40.652
Even your name
hides who you are.

38:40.686 --> 38:42.621
My name? Clarice?

38:42.654 --> 38:45.190
Clarice is a name for a human.

38:45.223 --> 38:46.892
Tell me this,

38:46.925 --> 38:48.794
-what can you do?
-You know what I can do.

38:48.827 --> 38:50.261
Tell me.

38:52.330 --> 38:53.665
I portal.

38:53.699 --> 38:57.135
I, uh, blink
from place to place.

38:57.168 --> 39:00.506
Blink. (chuckles)

39:00.539 --> 39:04.075
I like that.

39:04.109 --> 39:05.711
Never hide

39:05.744 --> 39:08.980
who you are, Blink.

39:09.014 --> 39:12.551
You are glorious.

39:23.361 --> 39:25.263
Oh, my God, the looks
on the cops' faces.

39:25.296 --> 39:26.498
Yeah, I know.

39:26.532 --> 39:28.734
-That was sick.
-(laughs)

39:28.767 --> 39:31.770
I... I had fun today.

39:31.803 --> 39:33.739
Yeah. Me, too.

39:46.585 --> 39:48.754
(elevator bell chimes)

39:56.428 --> 39:58.964
How was your little outing?

39:58.997 --> 40:02.100
It was great. We had fun.

40:02.133 --> 40:04.102
-We can see that.
-You're practically glowing.

40:04.135 --> 40:05.537
A whole new you.

40:05.571 --> 40:07.739
I'm starting to feel
like myself again.

40:11.009 --> 40:12.611
So...

40:12.644 --> 40:15.514
what's this big mission?

40:22.488 --> 40:26.124
* Today *

40:26.157 --> 40:28.126
* We will see the sun *

40:28.159 --> 40:31.229
* In flames *

40:31.262 --> 40:35.300
* Tidal waves *

40:35.333 --> 40:37.736
* Washing all the world *

40:37.769 --> 40:40.806
* Away *

40:40.839 --> 40:43.208
* Today *

40:45.644 --> 40:49.581
* Everything we thought
will change... *

40:49.615 --> 40:51.850
(shouting)

40:51.883 --> 40:54.486
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh *

40:54.520 --> 40:57.723
* Oh, oh, oh, oh *

40:59.525 --> 41:01.359
* Just let go *

41:01.392 --> 41:03.762
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh *

41:03.795 --> 41:05.697
* Oh, oh, oh *

41:05.731 --> 41:07.633
* Oh, oh *

41:09.167 --> 41:11.169
* And just let go *

41:11.202 --> 41:15.306
* We will rise *

41:15.340 --> 41:16.742
* Together *

41:31.089 --> 41:33.792
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh *

41:33.825 --> 41:36.094
* Oh, oh, oh, oh *

41:38.897 --> 41:41.199
* Just let go *

41:41.232 --> 41:45.236
* We will rise *

41:45.270 --> 41:48.506
* Together *

41:48.540 --> 41:50.976
* Just let go *

41:51.009 --> 41:54.546
* We will rise *

41:54.580 --> 41:56.882
* Together. *

42:08.927 --> 42:10.929
(dialing)

42:14.265 --> 42:15.701
Hey, it's Jace.

42:15.734 --> 42:18.336
You know the-the patient files
from the clinic?

42:18.369 --> 42:19.871
I think I may have
found something.

42:19.905 --> 42:21.907
We're gonna hit them
where they live.

42:58.576 --> 43:00.511
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

43:02.948 --> 43:05.083
It's time to pick a side
on The Gifted.

43:05.116 --> 43:07.418
Here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

43:09.587 --> 43:10.789
Buckle up, buttercup.

43:13.124 --> 43:15.460
It's real, and it pulls
people together.

43:15.493 --> 43:19.064
-* We're breaking waves
shooting star *
-(siren wailing)

43:19.097 --> 43:22.634
* We live for glory
not forever *

43:22.668 --> 43:23.669
MAN: Touchdown!

43:23.702 --> 43:27.272
* Reach out *

43:27.305 --> 43:30.909
* Make this right here
right now *

43:30.942 --> 43:33.845
* Stand up *

43:34.713 --> 43:36.481
* Here right now *

43:36.514 --> 43:38.149
That sounds like fun.
