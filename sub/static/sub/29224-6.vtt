So, we're just trying to understand
your relationship with Bryce.

01:37.388 --> 01:39.641
Well, that's easy,
'cause there wasn't one.

01:39.849 --> 01:42.060
Did you ever have any contact with him?

01:42.143 --> 01:43.143
No.

01:43.686 --> 01:44.686
Really?

01:46.147 --> 01:49.109
So, you went to the same school,
and knew some of the same people,

01:49.192 --> 01:50.568
but your paths never crossed?

01:51.111 --> 01:56.032
Obviously, our paths crossed in the halls,
but he wasn't my friend.

01:56.116 --> 01:59.077
I don't imagine he would be,
after what he did to your friends.

02:00.620 --> 02:01.746
And what he got away with.

02:01.830 --> 02:03.832
But that doesn't mean
you didn't have contact.

02:07.919 --> 02:09.128
It's his funeral today.

02:10.213 --> 02:11.297
So it is, yeah.

02:12.340 --> 02:14.592
Still, it's... sad...

02:15.844 --> 02:19.139
isn't it? Any young life taken like that,
that's sad, don't you think?

02:23.476 --> 02:25.103
It isn't the greatest sadness

02:26.146 --> 02:27.313
of my life, so...

02:28.857 --> 02:29.691
no.

Tony Padilla was always
the master secret keeper.

02:39.033 --> 02:40.033
So...

02:40.910 --> 02:43.163
we should have known
he was keeping a big one.

They promised four uniformed deputies
and the sheriff is here.

02:53.298 --> 02:56.134
They don't really think
children would disrupt a funeral?

02:56.217 --> 02:57.969
They found flyers at the school.

02:58.052 --> 03:00.722
But all these people have come
to pay their respects.

03:00.805 --> 03:02.974
I'm not sure that's why they're all here.

03:03.683 --> 03:06.436
I can't help but think
his killer might be one of them.

03:09.355 --> 03:10.607

03:26.497 --> 03:27.957

03:29.584 --> 03:30.585
You can.

03:33.254 --> 03:34.255
You have to.

03:34.714 --> 03:36.966
It's okay to love the things
about him you loved.

03:37.675 --> 03:39.928
You can tell whatever truth
that you want to.

03:42.096 --> 03:45.475
<i>Grief makes us behave in ways

03:47.018 --> 03:48.658

03:49.896 --> 03:51.439
Yeah, I'm good. Good.

03:52.649 --> 03:55.568

04:02.367 --> 04:04.202

04:26.432 --> 04:27.600
<i>I absolutely did.</i>

04:27.684 --> 04:31.062
I told you not to even look at me today,
let alone text.

04:31.145 --> 04:32.939
I'm stuck between Mrs. Walker and my mum.

04:33.022 --> 04:36.025
- We have to talk about the Mustang.
<i>- </i> I am 99% positive it's his.

04:36.109 --> 04:38.444
Tony told me he sold it
to help his dad's shop,

04:38.528 --> 04:41.656
to a family in Arizona. He says,
"A piece of my heart is in Arizona."

04:41.739 --> 04:44.200
- You've heard him say it.
- You always believe him?

04:44.492 --> 04:45.660
He's never lied to me.

04:46.286 --> 04:49.455
He's withheld certain information
for a period of time,

04:49.539 --> 04:52.250
- but that's a whole other story.
- Clay, I'm telling you, it's his.

04:52.333 --> 04:55.378
There's no way. And I can prove it to you.
As soon as I can find Tony.

04:55.753 --> 04:56.753
What?

04:59.799 --> 05:01.384
Caleb's not answering texts or calls.

05:01.467 --> 05:03.928
The garage is closed.
We'll go by his house later.

05:05.013 --> 05:06.764
Shit! My mum. Bye.

05:07.849 --> 05:10.143
- It's not Tony's car.
- We'll discuss it later.

05:14.355 --> 05:17.025
Thank you. Thank you very much.

05:24.324 --> 05:27.910
Whoa, what a turnout.
Oh, look. You made it.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.623
Late, to his own son's funeral!

05:33.708 --> 05:35.209
What's that? No, it's...

05:35.293 --> 05:36.669
Why am I not surprised?

05:38.171 --> 05:42.175
It's fortunate that he was able
to find his way back to attend.

05:42.842 --> 05:46.429
He found his way back
to sign the divorce papers, but, yes.

05:47.472 --> 05:51.517
Sorry, Mum. I ran into a friend
on my way to the restroom.

05:52.101 --> 05:56.022
And I see you never made it
to the restroom. Now hush.

06:00.818 --> 06:03.488
Look at him. Like it's a goddamn wedding.

06:04.197 --> 06:06.866
- Don't you start crying. Don't you dare.
- All right.

06:07.033 --> 06:09.077
You owe me money.
Yes, you do.

06:12.580 --> 06:13.664
All right, thank you.

06:21.089 --> 06:22.715
- Bryce.
- Dad.

06:25.134 --> 06:26.134
Hey.

06:26.719 --> 06:27.719
Bryce.

06:29.222 --> 06:32.767
This is Katya.
Katya, this is my son, Bryce.

06:32.934 --> 06:34.143
I've heard so much about you.

06:34.644 --> 06:36.270
Yeah, yeah, me too.

06:38.523 --> 06:39.565
It's good to see you, son.

06:41.025 --> 06:44.070
- Um, I think your mom...
- Listen, if you're in town for a few days,

06:44.654 --> 06:47.115
you know,
we haven't been to the club in forever.

06:47.782 --> 06:49.033
- I'd like that.
- Cool.

06:50.493 --> 06:53.329
Unfortunately,
I'm headed to Dubai tomorrow

06:53.413 --> 06:54.622
for a couple of weeks.

06:55.248 --> 06:57.625
- And possibly longer.
- I thought we were meeting

06:57.708 --> 07:00.268
- with the decorator at the house?
- You got a new house?

07:00.294 --> 07:03.339
That's great, Dad. I know you always
had your eye on that big colonial

07:03.423 --> 07:05.734
- on Summer Drive...
- We'll have to postpone the decorator.

07:05.758 --> 07:07.958
We're in a great new modern
they just built on Cosgrove.

07:08.636 --> 07:11.681
We thought it might be good to...
get a property in town.

07:11.764 --> 07:12.598
Sure, sure.

07:12.765 --> 07:14.934
We're gonna have to
reschedule the decorator.

07:15.017 --> 07:17.413
Maybe when you get back.
I'll let you cheat on your handicap.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.313
We'll get something on the books.

07:20.898 --> 07:23.651
The wait's too long, Bryce.
Let's go to Chez Mitchelli.

07:23.734 --> 07:24.734
All right.

07:25.319 --> 07:26.404
I'll see you soon, then.

07:27.405 --> 07:31.200
<i>It was as if Mr. Walker had tried
to erase Bryce from his life.</i>

07:32.994 --> 07:35.371
<i>And yet, he couldn't seem to escape.</i>

07:36.038 --> 07:37.290
<i>- </i> Barry.
- Yes?

07:37.623 --> 07:38.892
- Hello.
- Nora, hi.

07:38.916 --> 07:41.419
We've got a seat for you up front
with the family.

07:41.502 --> 07:43.504
- All right.
- You don't mind if I steal him?

07:43.588 --> 07:46.132
Thank you.
Thank you for coming, all of you.

07:46.215 --> 07:47.633
- It's all right.
- Thank you.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.137
How many drinks have you had
this morning?

07:51.220 --> 07:52.305
Get off my ass.

07:52.722 --> 07:55.683
- We are burying our son today!
- Yeah. Exactly.

07:57.435 --> 07:58.686
Barry Walker.

07:59.937 --> 08:01.147
There he is!

08:02.023 --> 08:03.232
Over here, young man..

08:05.151 --> 08:06.944
Harrison, it's so good to see you.

08:08.446 --> 08:11.574
- Don't be a stranger, you hear me?
- Not a chance of it.

08:13.075 --> 08:14.235
- Barry.
- Yeah?

08:14.619 --> 08:17.222
I assume Richard will call
when the papers are ready?

08:17.246 --> 08:19.046
Or should I expect
you'll get cold feet again?

08:19.123 --> 08:20.833
No, I consider it settled, Nora.

08:21.876 --> 08:24.086
We got the numbers.
Richard will be in touch.

08:24.295 --> 08:25.338
I'll show you to the door.

08:25.421 --> 08:26.631
Not necessary.

08:27.048 --> 08:29.383
Harrison, good night, and be well.

08:30.009 --> 08:31.969
- Bryce.
- Terra Tech, Walker.

08:32.094 --> 08:34.096
I'm telling you, it's undervalued.

08:41.062 --> 08:44.732
It's not about the money, Mom.
It's about making you pay for leaving.

08:44.815 --> 08:47.026
As soon as he signs,
he can't do that anymore.

08:47.109 --> 08:49.695
- Scares him shitless.
- Watch your language, kid.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.323
I think you're a fool, Nora.

08:53.783 --> 08:55.201
That's nice, Dad. Thank you.

08:55.826 --> 08:58.412
He was the best thing
that ever happened to you.

08:58.496 --> 09:01.666
A fighter, that man. A climber. Self-made.

09:01.874 --> 09:03.914
- Self-made with my money.
- My money!

09:03.960 --> 09:07.088
You didn't work a goddamn day
in your life!

09:07.171 --> 09:08.589
Perhaps it's time for a nap.

09:08.714 --> 09:11.092
Don't touch the goddamn chair!

09:11.175 --> 09:12.510
- Let's just...
- I said no,

09:12.593 --> 09:14.512
- goddammit!
- Dad, calm down!

09:14.637 --> 09:16.138
I will not calm down!

09:16.222 --> 09:18.975
You never treated Barry
with the proper respect!

09:19.058 --> 09:20.476
You were taught better than that.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.103
By the way you treated Mom?

09:22.186 --> 09:24.230
Listen to me, you selfish bitch...

09:24.313 --> 09:25.898
That is enough. Enough!

09:26.691 --> 09:28.693
You do not speak
to my mother that way!

09:28.985 --> 09:32.280
Ever again. Or I swear to God,
I will roll you out into the street

09:32.363 --> 09:34.615
and you can crawl your way
back into this house.

09:48.004 --> 09:51.424
Mr. Walker, I'm sorry for your loss.
Bryce was a fine boy.

09:51.507 --> 09:55.136
Yes, he was really. At heart. Thank you.

09:55.886 --> 09:56.971
And what's your name?

09:57.930 --> 09:59.181
Amorowat Anysia.

09:59.265 --> 10:01.475
That's a beautiful name.
What does it mean?

10:01.851 --> 10:03.311
Amorowat means "loves God."

10:03.978 --> 10:07.148
- Good. Can you put in a word for me?
- Barry.

10:07.982 --> 10:08.982
Barry.

10:09.275 --> 10:10.443
Leave the girl alone.

10:11.694 --> 10:12.820
Are you okay?

10:19.076 --> 10:22.413
<i>Clay couldn't accept the idea
that maybe Tony killed Bryce.</i>

10:23.039 --> 10:24.040
Mr. Walker.

10:25.333 --> 10:28.336
<i>He was doing anything he could
to find another suspect.</i>

10:32.131 --> 10:34.634
Mom? What's the deal with Bryce's dad?

10:35.676 --> 10:38.236
- I don't really know him. Why?
- Taught me everything...

10:38.304 --> 10:41.104
Didn't you guys get into a big fight
after I went over there last year?

10:41.140 --> 10:43.893
Yes. His wife played mediator, though.

10:44.977 --> 10:46.228
I think he's mostly talk.

10:48.981 --> 10:51.400
Did you know he just, like,
abandoned Bryce?

10:53.069 --> 10:54.070
I didn't know that.

10:57.031 --> 11:01.243
- But I can say I'm not very surprised.
- Honey. It's his son's funeral.

11:02.078 --> 11:03.718
You wouldn't know it from looking at him.

11:11.545 --> 11:12.630
Thank you, kid.

11:31.315 --> 11:34.318
- How's the family?
- His dad seems pretty good.

11:34.652 --> 11:37.863
- His mom, maybe not so much.
- Did you talk to Zach?

11:38.447 --> 11:41.575
That asshole hated Bryce.
I don't know why he's talking.

11:41.659 --> 11:42.993
'Cause he's the team captain.

11:43.661 --> 11:46.122
Why are you even here?
You weren't his friend at the end.

11:46.455 --> 11:47.623
Neither were you, man.

11:48.833 --> 11:50.553
But there was a time
when we both loved him.

11:51.627 --> 11:53.212
I didn't... love him.

11:53.796 --> 11:54.796
I did.

11:55.548 --> 11:58.634
He was always really nice to me.
Even when I was a freshman.

11:59.802 --> 12:01.053
I guess he changed.

12:02.054 --> 12:03.054
No.

12:04.014 --> 12:07.226
The same guy who was nice to you
is the same guy someone wanted dead.

12:09.228 --> 12:12.648
You may not know this, Tony,
but whenever there's a murder

12:12.732 --> 12:15.860
involving a vehicle,
we pull that vehicle apart piece by piece.

12:16.819 --> 12:19.113
And we found this new tail light lens.

12:19.196 --> 12:21.615
And we traced that back
to the distributor,

12:21.699 --> 12:24.827
and we found out where
that particular part was wholesaled to.

12:26.537 --> 12:27.663
And it led us to...

12:30.040 --> 12:31.167
Padilla Automotive.

12:33.502 --> 12:35.379
I guess he brought his car into the shop.

12:35.463 --> 12:37.423
But you said
you didn't have any contact with him.

12:37.465 --> 12:39.341
Maybe Javier dealt with him.

12:41.719 --> 12:42.719
Okay.

12:43.637 --> 12:44.805
Well, we can bring Javier in.

12:44.889 --> 12:47.409
Of course, that would mean
a complete check of his legal status.

12:50.227 --> 12:51.707
It's not illegal to fix a tail light.

12:51.771 --> 12:54.440
It's illegal to lie about it
if you're covering up a crime.

12:59.487 --> 13:01.113
I think I'd like to see a lawyer now.

13:02.740 --> 13:03.740
All right.

13:04.909 --> 13:05.909
Tony.

13:08.329 --> 13:09.747
I want you to think about this.

13:10.873 --> 13:11.873
Okay?

13:12.875 --> 13:16.253
You got a good heart.
I know you do. My son told me that.

13:18.839 --> 13:20.132
I feel the same way about him.

13:20.216 --> 13:22.676
All right, but you got a history
working against you.

13:23.219 --> 13:26.764
I don't want to put you in the position
where you appear to be uncooperative.

13:30.059 --> 13:31.185
I appreciate that.

13:31.936 --> 13:33.854
I'd also appreciate seeing a lawyer.

13:39.735 --> 13:40.735
Okay.

14:06.178 --> 14:08.514
Bryce was a real competitor on the field.

14:11.100 --> 14:12.351
He fought for his team.

14:13.978 --> 14:14.978
Always.

14:16.313 --> 14:17.314
He was loyal,

14:19.149 --> 14:20.150
and he was strong.

14:22.278 --> 14:23.278
He was...

14:23.946 --> 14:26.198
the kind of strong
that I always wished that I could be.

14:29.285 --> 14:30.285
In a way.

14:35.624 --> 14:37.960
I didn't always agree with Bryce.

14:43.257 --> 14:44.258
Or what he did.

14:48.053 --> 14:51.515
But I wonder sometimes
if all we are is the sum of our actions...

14:52.933 --> 14:53.933
in the end.

14:57.521 --> 14:58.939
Or if we're more than that.

15:03.736 --> 15:05.821
I want to believe
that we're more than that.

15:12.244 --> 15:15.122
There was a time
where I called Bryce Walker my brother.

15:17.750 --> 15:20.210
And there was a time where I didn't.

15:23.547 --> 15:25.299
But we're all brothers and sisters.

15:26.634 --> 15:27.635
All of us.

15:28.260 --> 15:29.845
And whether I like it or not...

15:36.268 --> 15:37.686
I am my brother's keeper.

15:42.066 --> 15:43.066
So...

15:47.696 --> 15:48.696
Bryce...

15:52.618 --> 15:53.618
I'm sorry.

15:55.913 --> 15:57.164
I'm sorry, and...

16:03.754 --> 16:04.755
And goodbye.

16:08.842 --> 16:10.511
There is a son that

16:11.512 --> 16:12.888
only a mother can see.

16:15.224 --> 16:18.143
A mother always sees the little boy
inside the man.

16:21.230 --> 16:24.483
So, there is a a Bryce
I wish you all had known.

16:27.695 --> 16:28.862
He was capable...

16:31.407 --> 16:32.574
of hurtful things.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.870
And he was capable of deep love.

16:42.543 --> 16:43.794
He had a soul that...

16:46.797 --> 16:48.007
wanted to be good.

16:50.759 --> 16:52.761
And a heart that didn't always know how.

16:57.349 --> 16:58.392
But he...

16:58.517 --> 16:59.768
He was growing...

17:00.936 --> 17:02.021
and getting better.

17:04.314 --> 17:07.358
And there were moments
in these last months

17:07.443 --> 17:10.069
where I saw not only the little boy...

17:12.114 --> 17:15.117
but the good, good man he might become.

17:24.542 --> 17:25.544
Need a hand?

17:26.627 --> 17:27.627
Oh!

17:29.631 --> 17:32.426
No, thank you.
I hired the painters for next week...

17:33.343 --> 17:36.055
but I got a bee in my bonnet.
We'll see how far I get.

17:38.140 --> 17:39.540
All right. Well, here, let me help.

17:40.184 --> 17:41.602
Dear God, how bored are you?

17:41.852 --> 17:44.354
I'm fine. I just want to help.

17:45.731 --> 17:49.026
Oh, this is a very enthusiastic color.

17:49.651 --> 17:51.862
It was very fashionable in the '70s.

17:51.945 --> 17:53.906
Well, that decade was on
all kinds of drugs.

17:54.615 --> 17:57.618
Hey, maybe after this
you could paint Grandpa's room magenta.

17:58.077 --> 18:00.954
And then we could do my prison cell
in, like, tangerine.

18:01.038 --> 18:02.247
Your prison cell?

18:02.331 --> 18:04.249
You feel like
you're serving your sentence?

18:04.333 --> 18:06.835
No, I didn't... I didn't mean that.

18:09.338 --> 18:12.466
I asked your grandfather
to paint these walls when I was a kid.

18:13.300 --> 18:16.220
I wanted a lime green base
with dark green circles.

18:16.470 --> 18:17.679
I begged.

18:17.763 --> 18:21.350
And he was remodeling, too,
I thought it'd be easy, but... no.

18:21.642 --> 18:23.519
I came home one day,
walked in and...

18:25.020 --> 18:26.438
he'd painted the walls that.

18:27.314 --> 18:29.024
The sweet revenge of lime green.

18:29.108 --> 18:33.195
His interior designer, who'd become
step-monster number three, Donna,

18:34.279 --> 18:36.406
she said green was <i>"trés gauche."</i>

18:36.824 --> 18:39.576
And what Daddy wanted, Daddy got, so...

18:40.327 --> 18:41.453
Donna got her walls.

18:42.079 --> 18:43.205
And now you get yours.

18:43.372 --> 18:44.373
Oh, shit!

18:54.842 --> 18:57.594
Um... do you have...

18:58.053 --> 18:59.053
What are you...

18:59.221 --> 19:00.264
What are you doing?

19:00.931 --> 19:02.766
- Well, we'll paint the floors, too.
- What?

19:02.850 --> 19:06.687
And the ceiling.
No. No, the ceiling we paint sky blue.

19:08.021 --> 19:09.690
- Are you being serious right now?
- Yeah.

19:09.773 --> 19:13.360
All right, are you sure that a 31-Flavor
color palette's what you want to go with?

19:15.737 --> 19:17.614
- Oh, need more.
- Jeez, no!

19:17.698 --> 19:18.949
No! No!

19:19.032 --> 19:20.117
Mom, this...

19:20.200 --> 19:22.800
Dammit!

19:26.790 --> 19:29.209
I can't... I can't juke in this room!

19:37.676 --> 19:38.677
I loved him.

19:43.056 --> 19:44.057
We loved him.

19:47.936 --> 19:49.605
Bryce Walker was a rapist!

19:50.105 --> 19:52.941
Believe survivors!
- Mourn the victim, not the rapist!

19:53.025 --> 19:54.401
Get that sign down!

19:54.484 --> 19:57.362
- Bryce Walker should burn in hell!
- Shut up!

19:57.446 --> 19:58.739
Justice for Hannah!

19:58.822 --> 20:01.200
- Take that sign down!
- Justice for Jessica!

20:01.283 --> 20:03.493
- Shut your mouth!
- End rape culture!

20:03.577 --> 20:04.912
Where the hell are the police?

20:04.995 --> 20:05.995
Come with me now.

20:10.334 --> 20:12.211
Get your hands off our bodies.

20:13.670 --> 20:15.505
Get off me!

20:15.589 --> 20:17.674
Disrupting a boy's funeral,

20:17.758 --> 20:19.051
you little shit!

20:20.052 --> 20:21.345
Do your job!

20:28.810 --> 20:29.810
Thank you.

20:30.103 --> 20:31.605
Amorowat, we're leaving.

20:31.939 --> 20:33.690
Where's Barry? What's going on?

20:33.774 --> 20:36.568
It's going to be just fine, Mr. Chatham.
We're taking you home now.

20:36.652 --> 20:38.332
Did they arrest those girls?

20:38.403 --> 20:39.403
Ani.

20:40.948 --> 20:42.074
As I was saying,

20:42.491 --> 20:45.369
one minute he's laughing
way too loud for a funeral,

20:45.786 --> 20:47.788
the next minute he's attacking a girl.

20:47.913 --> 20:50.958
Are you looking at Mr. Walker
because you really think something,

20:51.041 --> 20:53.543
or because you want to look
at anyone besides Tony?

20:53.752 --> 20:55.837
Barry Walker is one scary dude.

20:55.921 --> 21:00.050
It's his son's funeral.
And he's signing his divorce papers today.

21:00.133 --> 21:02.511
Yeah. He was drunk and he was angry.

21:02.636 --> 21:05.222
Hey, you're telling me
you've never seen him like that before?

21:06.598 --> 21:07.975
<i>Mr. Walker had a temper.</i>

21:09.935 --> 21:11.270
<i>That much I knew for sure.</i>

21:12.062 --> 21:14.773
God damn it, you little shit.

21:16.817 --> 21:17.818
Hey, Dad.

21:17.985 --> 21:20.696
Twenty thousand in damage,
you goddamn little bastard.

21:20.779 --> 21:23.407
Twenty fucking thousand dollars!

21:24.074 --> 21:25.951
I should break your fucking head.

21:26.535 --> 21:28.161
Well, let's do it. Hit me.

21:30.914 --> 21:31.914
Barry!

21:32.124 --> 21:33.166
Let him go!

21:33.458 --> 21:34.459
Let him go!

21:37.921 --> 21:39.506
You just let him run wild.

21:39.715 --> 21:41.967
You let him do whatever the fuck he wants!

21:42.050 --> 21:44.112
- What are you talking about?
- I come home last night,

21:44.136 --> 21:45.345
I find a broken window,

21:45.429 --> 21:47.973
my alarm going off,
the house turned upside down.

21:48.223 --> 21:50.434
I thought I'd been robbed,
but nothing was missing.

21:50.517 --> 21:52.060
I'm sure it wasn't Bryce.

21:52.853 --> 21:54.646
Yes. Yeah, actually, it was.

21:55.230 --> 21:56.898
What? Bryce?

21:56.982 --> 22:00.222
Well, it's kind of a funny story. I went
to the wrong house first a few weeks ago.

22:00.277 --> 22:04.698
And then we were lucky enough
to run into Dad and... Katrina.

22:05.073 --> 22:07.534
- Katya.
- Which is a stripper's name, but whatever.

22:08.035 --> 22:10.954
So, I knew which ridiculously
expensive house they'd chosen.

22:11.038 --> 22:13.665
And then when the two of them
skipped town again, I just...

22:13.790 --> 22:15.751
went over to Dad's
and I played a little golf...

22:16.335 --> 22:17.336
in the living room,

22:17.919 --> 22:20.714
and the kitchen and then the wine cellar.
Then I drank some wine

22:20.797 --> 22:21.631
then I had to piss,

22:21.715 --> 22:24.235
- so I did that up in the bedroom.
- You're paying.

22:24.426 --> 22:26.636
You're paying for the damage.
Every goddamn dime.

22:26.720 --> 22:29.157
- No, I don't see that happening.
- You've fucked with me enough

22:29.181 --> 22:30.015
in this lifetime.

22:30.098 --> 22:32.434
All right. Well, why don't you
just take me to court, then?

22:32.601 --> 22:34.478
And I'll tell the judge about Caitlin.

22:37.397 --> 22:39.066
- How do you...
- Who's Caitlin?

22:41.818 --> 22:44.905
Caitlin is your nuclear option, Mom.

22:46.448 --> 22:49.326
Wouldn't matter if Dad
had signed the divorce papers, but...

22:49.826 --> 22:51.078
he decided to risk it.

22:59.544 --> 23:01.171
You're gonna regret this, son.

23:02.047 --> 23:03.047
Son?

23:03.715 --> 23:05.175
Are you fucking kidding me?

23:05.675 --> 23:06.676
Get out.

23:07.427 --> 23:08.428
I'll fill Mom in.

23:15.185 --> 23:16.185
Okay.

23:17.145 --> 23:19.564
<i>How deep were the Walker family secrets?</i>

23:21.024 --> 23:23.318
<i>And just how much was Mr. Walker hiding?</i>

23:24.778 --> 23:25.821
<i>We had to think,</i>

23:26.696 --> 23:27.989
<i>what about Mr. Walker?</i>

23:31.952 --> 23:33.662
I have to tell you about Caitlin.

23:34.996 --> 23:35.996
Come on.

23:37.124 --> 23:39.793
I didn't want to believe
that a father could kill his own son.

23:41.169 --> 23:43.489
But then again, I didn't want to believe
that anyone could.

23:44.214 --> 23:46.925
Thanks for coming with me
to this today.

23:47.717 --> 23:49.428
No, happy to do it. For you.

23:49.803 --> 23:52.681
- Hey, you two. Welcome.
- Hey, Ani.

23:53.014 --> 23:55.892
Do you mind if I steal Clay?
We've got a project.

23:56.685 --> 23:58.845
- I should probably stay with Justin.
- I'm good alone.

23:59.479 --> 24:01.189
- Brilliant.
- Okay.

24:02.399 --> 24:04.276
There are valets guarding the garage,

24:04.359 --> 24:06.611
but we can get in
once people start leaving.

24:06.695 --> 24:09.424
We have to find those divorce papers.
If Bryce knew about a mistress...

24:09.448 --> 24:12.492
They’re both stinking rich.
Money wouldn’t be a motive.

24:12.576 --> 24:14.411
What if Bryce broke up the relationship?

24:14.494 --> 24:15.662
Can we look at the car?

24:16.580 --> 24:18.165
Amorowat. There you are.

24:18.665 --> 24:21.460
Please, refill the ice.
These caterers can't keep up.

24:21.793 --> 24:22.793
Yes, Mummy.

24:23.670 --> 24:25.755
Young man, you're a welcome guest.

24:26.173 --> 24:27.382
You should go enjoy the party.

24:27.799 --> 24:29.676
Yes, ma'am. Mrs. Achola.

24:33.221 --> 24:34.221
I'll just...

24:34.681 --> 24:35.724
find my way round.

25:12.344 --> 25:13.344
Hey.

25:14.304 --> 25:15.304
Hey.

25:15.931 --> 25:18.099
Ah, I was just looking for the bathroom.

25:19.809 --> 25:21.144
Oh, yeah. Ani...

25:21.811 --> 25:23.605
had me looking for some more...

25:24.523 --> 25:26.983
flowers. I guess they're not up here
after all.

25:27.067 --> 25:30.737
Right. Well, I'm just...
gonna keep looking for the bathroom.

25:31.696 --> 25:33.823
- Right. Good luck.
- Yeah, thanks.

26:02.269 --> 26:03.395
Did you find anything?

26:04.604 --> 26:06.022
Caitlin wasn't the mistress.

26:06.606 --> 26:07.983
I found the divorce papers.

26:08.066 --> 26:10.569
She's listed as one
of Barry Walker's dependents.

26:10.652 --> 26:11.652
Dependent?

26:13.196 --> 26:14.197
Like a child?

26:15.824 --> 26:18.451
<i>Mr. Walker had secrets, yes.</i>

26:19.744 --> 26:23.039
<i>But secrets lose their power
once they've been exposed.</i>

26:24.666 --> 26:25.666
<i>Bryce?</i>

26:26.543 --> 26:27.543
Honey?

26:29.504 --> 26:31.172
Was that his plan all along?

26:32.549 --> 26:33.550
To replace me?

26:37.137 --> 26:38.680
I don't think he had a plan.

26:39.806 --> 26:40.849
I think he just

26:41.474 --> 26:43.351
took what he wanted
when he wanted it.

26:44.185 --> 26:47.897
And the rest of us
are collateral damage, including her.

26:48.440 --> 26:50.859
So you're not going to destroy him
with it?

26:52.319 --> 26:53.319
No.

26:54.029 --> 26:55.530
I have no need to destroy him.

26:57.324 --> 27:00.869
And certainly not her.
She's a 12-year-old girl.

27:04.998 --> 27:08.627
Maybe it's time
to stop letting his whims rule our lives.

27:09.794 --> 27:11.254
To be done with the anger.

27:15.675 --> 27:16.676
And if it helps...

27:19.262 --> 27:20.388
she's stuck with him.

27:21.014 --> 27:22.014
You're not.

27:24.225 --> 27:25.225
Yeah.

27:28.647 --> 27:30.857
I guess I'm just not done
with my anger yet.

27:34.402 --> 27:35.402
I know.

27:37.572 --> 27:39.741
<i>Mr. Walker had abandoned his son,</i>

27:40.450 --> 27:42.702
<i>and tried
to hide an illegitimate daughter.</i>

27:43.953 --> 27:47.582
<i>But he didn't want Bryce dead.
He had other ways of hurting him.</i>

27:47.957 --> 27:48.957
Well,

27:49.167 --> 27:51.294
no consequences, no motive.

27:52.003 --> 27:56.591
Mr. Walker's an arsehole,
but not a killer, it seems.

27:57.217 --> 27:58.551
Though you think Tony might be?

27:58.927 --> 27:59.927
I don't, but...

28:00.887 --> 28:01.888
Okay, hurry.

28:04.349 --> 28:05.934
<i>While Tony's secrets...</i>

28:06.726 --> 28:08.561
<i>were still safely locked away.</i>

28:09.688 --> 28:13.274
Everybody collects Mustangs.
They're a whole thing, apparently.

28:13.525 --> 28:15.985
Well, I feel like
this is a very specific Mustang.

28:51.980 --> 28:54.232
There's got to be a good explanation
for this.

28:54.941 --> 28:56.526
What do you think it might be?

28:58.111 --> 28:59.362
I don't know.

29:02.240 --> 29:03.366
But he didn't do it.

29:48.745 --> 29:49.954
Can I help you?

29:52.290 --> 29:53.290
Um...

29:53.500 --> 29:56.920
No, I'm looking for Tony Padilla.

29:57.170 --> 29:59.714
Or his parents or brothers.

30:00.381 --> 30:01.758
They don't live here anymore.

30:03.218 --> 30:04.218
That's...

30:05.512 --> 30:08.014
Really? Where...
Do you know where he lives?

30:09.682 --> 30:10.682
I don't.

30:12.227 --> 30:14.145
I'm looking for him.
I'm a good friend of his.

30:14.646 --> 30:17.357
You're a good friend, huh?
Doesn't know where he lives.

30:18.858 --> 30:20.819
His family, they left the neighborhood.

30:21.402 --> 30:23.738
My friend, I think
that maybe you should do the same.

30:34.958 --> 30:36.501
What, so he's there all alone?

30:39.629 --> 30:42.340
- Why didn't he call anyone?
- He called me.

30:42.799 --> 30:43.799
And he's still...

30:44.092 --> 30:45.844
- They've still got him there?
- Yes.

30:46.052 --> 30:47.637
- Does he have a lawyer?
- Yes.

30:48.137 --> 30:49.722
Caleb, what the hell?

30:50.723 --> 30:53.142
- Why did they bring him in?
- It was a misunderstanding.

30:54.102 --> 30:55.520
Where'd his family move to?

30:55.603 --> 30:58.189
- You really have to talk to him.
- I can't right now.

30:58.815 --> 31:00.108
Why did Bryce have his Mustang?

31:03.987 --> 31:05.154
Did he steal it?

31:05.238 --> 31:06.239
No.

31:08.700 --> 31:09.784
Tony sold it to him.

31:10.869 --> 31:11.869
<i>Uh-oh!</i>

31:16.165 --> 31:17.542
My mom's gonna love you.

31:18.084 --> 31:21.170
She is, she's gonna love you.
My brothers, they'll try and scare you,

31:21.254 --> 31:23.256
but you can take any of 'em,
and they know it.

31:23.339 --> 31:25.484
I'm more worried about your dad.
He's old school, yeah?

31:25.508 --> 31:27.594
Yeah, he is, but he's learning.

31:28.219 --> 31:30.471
I came out to him when I was 14 years old.

31:31.014 --> 31:33.558
He kissed me on the forehead,
he said he loved me,

31:33.766 --> 31:35.476
and then he walked away,

31:35.852 --> 31:37.896
fell silent for six days.

31:38.646 --> 31:41.608
Then he comes to my room,
and he's all, "Tonio,

31:41.941 --> 31:43.568
let's watch <i>The Modern Families.</i>

31:43.985 --> 31:46.362
Let's watch <i>The Modern Families</i> together,
I love that show."

31:46.446 --> 31:47.572
God bless that show!

31:47.655 --> 31:50.950
I'm like, <i>"Papá, </i> I'm not gonna watch <i>The
Modern Families, </i>'cause I got shit to do.

31:51.034 --> 31:53.953
PS, there's no 'the, '
it's just <i>Modern Family."</i>

31:54.245 --> 31:56.039
Now I'm worried I might not be gay enough.

31:56.372 --> 31:58.833
- He's gonna love you.
- You sure?

31:59.125 --> 32:00.877
Yeah. 'Cause he knows that I do.

32:24.859 --> 32:26.361
Maybe they went to the store.

32:27.195 --> 32:29.405
No, something's... something's wrong.

32:49.759 --> 32:51.803
- This doesn't make any sense.
- What do you see?

32:52.887 --> 32:54.222
They left everything on.

32:56.307 --> 32:58.059
They must be
around here somewhere.

32:58.935 --> 32:59.935
Tonio.

33:13.199 --> 33:14.409
Tony, what's going on?

33:27.672 --> 33:29.090
Tony. Tony, please.

33:31.634 --> 33:32.635
What happened?

33:34.095 --> 33:35.304
It's my family, they...

33:37.098 --> 33:38.098
They're gone.

33:39.308 --> 33:40.308
ICE.

33:41.060 --> 33:42.061
Oh, God.

33:43.604 --> 33:44.856
Oh, God, Tony.

33:46.482 --> 33:47.482
Tony!

33:47.734 --> 33:50.278
<i>There are many things we grieve
that aren't death.</i>

33:50.445 --> 33:52.905
Tony, this is the third day
of school you've missed.

33:53.197 --> 33:54.198
School can wait.

33:54.866 --> 33:55.867
The shop can't.

34:00.538 --> 34:01.539
Padilla Auto.

34:02.915 --> 34:04.834
Yes. Yes, I can accept the charges.

34:11.382 --> 34:12.382
<i>Papá?</i>

34:32.320 --> 34:35.364
No, we got a lawyer, okay?
I don't care about the odds!

34:37.533 --> 34:38.534
I don't care.

34:44.456 --> 34:45.541
Don't worry.

34:47.293 --> 34:48.293
Don't worry.

34:51.255 --> 34:53.966
I'll be strong.
I'll be strong for everyone. I promise.

34:56.177 --> 34:57.386
Are they okay?

34:59.639 --> 35:03.434
My dad's in a detention center
in fucking San Diego.

35:05.228 --> 35:08.815
He got separated from my brothers
and my mom.

35:08.898 --> 35:10.942
He doesn't know where they are.
He hasn't seen them.

35:11.025 --> 35:13.462
The lawyers can work that out.
You told him you have a lawyer?

35:13.486 --> 35:15.246
Yes, but we have to
send a lawyer down there.

35:19.659 --> 35:20.952
They already have him...

35:23.955 --> 35:26.082
They already have my dad scheduled
for de...

35:28.334 --> 35:29.377
For deportation.

35:30.128 --> 35:31.504
Oh, Jesus, Tony.

35:32.505 --> 35:33.505
Jesus, Tony.

35:35.550 --> 35:38.469
<i>There is a grief beyond death.</i>

35:39.345 --> 35:41.430
<i>- Beyond imagining.</i>
- It's just you and me.

35:42.140 --> 35:43.141
<i>Beyond words.</i>

35:43.933 --> 35:45.977
I was able
to sell everything that I could.

35:46.060 --> 35:49.272
I tried to give Alejandro some money
for taking care of Graciella,

35:49.355 --> 35:50.857
but he wouldn't take it, so...

35:51.315 --> 35:54.569
I guess I have enough money
to pay the lawyers what we owe them,

35:54.652 --> 35:57.738
and after that,
I will figure something out.

35:57.822 --> 35:59.622
- We'll figure it out, Tony.
- No, I got this.

35:59.699 --> 36:01.576
Fuck you, Tony. You don't got this.

36:01.951 --> 36:02.994
Where are you going?

36:03.077 --> 36:05.477
I'm gonna crash at the office
in the garage for a few nights,

36:05.538 --> 36:08.040
and then after that,
I will figure something out.

36:08.624 --> 36:10.376
- Somewhere.
- You're staying here.

36:10.459 --> 36:12.128
I've been here for three nights.

36:12.211 --> 36:14.255
You're staying here, Tony.
This is your home.

36:14.338 --> 36:15.338
This is not my home.

36:16.132 --> 36:20.094
My home is on South 15th Street.
My home is where my family is.

36:20.178 --> 36:22.722
I know. And your home is
with people you love, and I love you.

36:23.264 --> 36:24.264
Tony.

36:24.432 --> 36:25.432
Listen to me.

36:25.892 --> 36:27.185
- You're not alone.
- I...

36:29.604 --> 36:31.022
I can't move in with you.

36:31.439 --> 36:32.481
Not like this.

36:33.316 --> 36:35.818
- I'm 18 years old.
- Yeah, so we're perfectly legal.

36:38.321 --> 36:41.574
We can't move in together
because I'm in trouble.

36:41.657 --> 36:43.159
How about because we love each other?

36:43.242 --> 36:45.620
- Because we want to live a life together?
- Life?

36:46.662 --> 36:47.955
Very messed up right now.

36:49.540 --> 36:50.540
Yeah.

36:51.500 --> 36:52.877
But your life is my life.

36:54.837 --> 36:55.837
Stay.

37:03.930 --> 37:04.931
Okay.

37:05.723 --> 37:06.723
Okay.

37:20.154 --> 37:21.364
How did I not know?

37:23.866 --> 37:25.076
He swore me to secrecy.

37:26.202 --> 37:29.622
He told me his dad was struggling,
that the garage needed help. I...

37:31.749 --> 37:33.960
I just took his word for it.
I'm a terrible friend.

37:34.961 --> 37:36.212
This is crazy.

37:37.004 --> 37:38.965
I mean, is he really that good
at keeping secrets?

37:39.048 --> 37:40.048
- Yes.
- Yes.

37:40.800 --> 37:42.260
You know the whole Hannah thing?

37:43.844 --> 37:44.845
Some of it.

37:45.638 --> 37:47.348
- He's still down there?
- Yeah.

37:47.431 --> 37:49.475
I came back to open the gym.
I'mma head back there.

37:50.017 --> 37:51.017
We're coming with you.

37:51.060 --> 37:53.896
Stop and think if that's really
a good idea, in any way.

37:57.608 --> 37:58.608
Okay. Well,

37:59.110 --> 38:01.237
you'll text us as soon as he's out?

38:01.320 --> 38:04.115
If you promise not to come running,
because he's gonna kill me.

38:04.240 --> 38:06.951
- We promise. Absolutely.
- And don't tell anyone.

38:17.795 --> 38:19.714
- Clay!
- I didn't agree to any of that.

38:27.930 --> 38:29.432
Justin. Hey, how's it going?

38:29.515 --> 38:31.851
It's pretty good, Charlie.
Think you could...

38:33.936 --> 38:35.438
If you could just give us a minute?

38:36.314 --> 38:37.314
Yeah.

38:37.356 --> 38:40.026
- For sure. I'll go do some gum.
- Cool.

38:40.109 --> 38:41.110
Yes, good!

38:43.696 --> 38:44.739
He's well trained.

38:46.407 --> 38:47.408
He's a good kid.

38:47.825 --> 38:49.076
Hmm. Jury's out.

38:51.245 --> 38:52.245
What's up?

38:56.167 --> 38:58.252
They, um, arrested Tony.

38:59.879 --> 39:01.213
He's been there all night.

39:03.090 --> 39:07.219
Clay says they've made some connection
with Bryce.

39:08.137 --> 39:09.137
Fuck!

39:10.514 --> 39:12.058
- Tony? I...
- I know.

39:13.517 --> 39:16.395
- You don't think he could, right?
- I don't know.

39:18.022 --> 39:20.941
Shit, I don't know.
I mean, he does lose it sometimes.

39:22.902 --> 39:24.612
You know Alex was taking roids?

39:25.863 --> 39:27.114
Buying them off of Bryce.

39:28.157 --> 39:29.325
God, I had no idea.

39:31.786 --> 39:35.373
You know, when Clay and Ani showed up
at the motel the other night, I...

39:36.290 --> 39:38.042
I was like, "This is ridiculous."

39:40.211 --> 39:41.211
But...

39:42.922 --> 39:43.922
now, I...

39:47.259 --> 39:48.259
One of us...

39:49.845 --> 39:52.431
Someone we know could've done this.

39:53.682 --> 39:54.682
Killed him.

39:55.643 --> 39:56.811
That's crazy.

39:57.520 --> 39:58.979
- Right?
- Is it?

39:59.647 --> 40:01.232
When your girls broke up the funeral...

40:01.315 --> 40:04.443
- I didn't want them to do that, Justin.
- Jess, I know.

40:07.947 --> 40:09.747
It just felt like
everyone was shitting on him

40:09.824 --> 40:11.909
and I could feel myself wanting
to stand up for him.

40:14.036 --> 40:16.330
I hate myself.
I fucking hate that I feel this way!

40:16.414 --> 40:17.456
Hey, hey, hey.

40:18.749 --> 40:20.042
Don't hate yourself.

40:20.709 --> 40:21.709
I get it.

40:23.170 --> 40:24.713
Fuck, I'm such an asshole!

40:25.381 --> 40:27.925
It's okay. No, you're not.

40:31.720 --> 40:33.055
He didn't deserve to die.

40:39.895 --> 40:40.895
He didn't.

40:45.067 --> 40:46.777
No. There's no way.

40:47.820 --> 40:50.197
I mean,
there's no way it could be Tony, right?

40:50.865 --> 40:51.782
I don't know.

40:51.866 --> 40:54.243
I mean, he's...
like, he can be a scary guy,

40:54.326 --> 40:57.580
but he's a really good person, isn't he?

40:58.456 --> 41:00.583
Yeah, I don't know who anyone is anymore.

41:02.418 --> 41:04.086
Maybe we shouldn't even work out.

41:05.880 --> 41:08.466
- Can your mom drive me home?
- Let's get in the ring.

41:09.133 --> 41:10.133
What?

41:10.968 --> 41:12.428
No. I mean...

41:13.220 --> 41:16.015
- First of all, you're not supposed to...
- Fuck that. I'll be fine.

41:17.266 --> 41:18.893
We could get in so much trouble.

41:19.435 --> 41:21.103
Well, I won't tell if you won't.

41:21.854 --> 41:23.772
We keep secrets for each other, right?

41:26.484 --> 41:29.278
<i>Tony's grief for his family
took on many forms.</i>

41:30.488 --> 41:31.488
<i>Shame.</i>

41:31.906 --> 41:32.906
<i>Anger.</i>

41:33.240 --> 41:34.240
<i>Fear.</i>

41:34.617 --> 41:37.745
<i>So, it is easy to cast suspicion.</i>

41:38.412 --> 41:40.915
What's up, man? Burning the weekend oil?

41:40.998 --> 41:44.001
Yeah, a few of us are meeting up
with Charlie. Get him ready.

41:44.460 --> 41:45.460
Oh, yeah?

41:46.921 --> 41:48.214
Okay. Yeah, that's good.

41:49.423 --> 41:50.424
That's good.

41:52.468 --> 41:53.468
Are you okay?

41:54.929 --> 41:56.096
Yeah, yeah. Great.

42:03.979 --> 42:05.689
Did you go to the funeral yesterday?

42:08.901 --> 42:09.901
Yeah.

42:11.445 --> 42:12.530
Still saying that...

42:13.405 --> 42:14.405
someone killed him.

42:18.536 --> 42:19.828
I don't know about that.

42:20.079 --> 42:21.580
Well, I'm just saying.

42:22.915 --> 42:23.999
It's a tough thing.

42:24.792 --> 42:27.920
- I know he was a big part of your life.
- I guess, yeah.

42:29.588 --> 42:32.091
Those fucking rape girls
protested his funeral

42:32.716 --> 42:34.009
with, like, banners and shit.

42:34.093 --> 42:37.096
Yeah, I heard.
How'd you guys take it?

42:37.513 --> 42:38.639
It pissed us off.

42:39.515 --> 42:40.975
I mean, they didn't know him.

42:42.393 --> 42:43.477
Burns me up, you know?

42:43.561 --> 42:45.271
Yeah, man. You loved him.

42:45.854 --> 42:48.274
Jesus, I didn't.
Why do people keep saying that?

42:50.985 --> 42:52.861
Look, he was your brother.

42:54.029 --> 42:55.030
And you loved him.

42:55.864 --> 42:57.074
And it fucking hurts.

42:59.243 --> 43:00.452
That's all okay, man.

43:03.998 --> 43:05.499
Yeah, it fucking hurts.

43:08.877 --> 43:10.879
<i>It was easy to misread the signs.</i>

43:11.589 --> 43:13.841
<i>I understand why
you got it wrong at first.</i>

43:14.425 --> 43:15.467
<i>Because we did, too.</i>

43:15.551 --> 43:16.969
Red 25, wide shoot.

43:17.636 --> 43:19.346
Um, quick sling to you?

43:20.681 --> 43:22.182
I mean to the tight end?

43:22.266 --> 43:26.186
No. Three wides, backs block,
so you have time to read the defense,

43:26.270 --> 43:28.397
then I release and you throw it to me.

43:28.814 --> 43:32.359
Backs block, you read the zone,
you have two wides on crossing routes.

43:33.652 --> 43:35.404
You've got two wides and, uh...

43:37.489 --> 43:40.200
One of them'll be your first option, okay?

43:41.076 --> 43:42.202
Oopah!

43:42.828 --> 43:45.247
Holy shit, they arrested Tony Padilla!

43:45.331 --> 43:46.957
- What the hell?
- Shit, for Bryce?

43:47.124 --> 43:48.964
What, you were gonna keep that
a secret, Zachy?

43:49.043 --> 43:51.211
Tony didn't do anything. He wouldn't.

43:51.295 --> 43:53.172
- He totally would, the kid's a thug.
- No.

43:53.255 --> 43:55.007
He isn't. He has, like, integrity.

43:55.090 --> 43:56.800
You're the one
that deserves to be in jail.

43:56.884 --> 43:59.595
Okay. Charlie, who would you trust
to have your back,

43:59.928 --> 44:01.639
me or that faggot Padilla?

44:02.181 --> 44:04.183
- Wait, Tony Padilla's a fag?
- Charlie!

44:05.643 --> 44:07.603
Be better, shut your mouth and listen.

44:07.686 --> 44:09.313
You got five days to learn an offense.

44:10.356 --> 44:11.356
Let's go.

44:12.107 --> 44:14.401
Your power comes
from your back leg and your hips.

44:15.277 --> 44:16.277
Right?

44:23.327 --> 44:24.787
Right, except that's not...

44:25.621 --> 44:27.414
I didn't think about your bad leg,

44:27.498 --> 44:28.832
how it can't really pivot.

44:29.833 --> 44:31.752
- Ow. Hey.
- I'm fine. Let's go.

44:32.419 --> 44:33.921
But your head, I don't think...

44:34.546 --> 44:36.048
- Dude!
- Come on, don't be a pussy!

44:36.131 --> 44:37.758
I thought you knew how to hit?

44:38.217 --> 44:40.719
Come on. You wanna hide in your room?
Look at your pictures?

44:41.220 --> 44:42.846
- Hit me, you freak!
- I said stop!

44:50.396 --> 44:53.107
Oh, my God.
I'm so, so sorry. Are you okay?

44:54.191 --> 44:56.360
- I'm fine.
- Alex, come on.

44:57.069 --> 44:58.070
Let's go again!

45:08.747 --> 45:09.747
Tony.

45:10.749 --> 45:12.251
Tony, come on.

45:13.043 --> 45:14.294
Guys, what did I say?

45:14.378 --> 45:16.940
I very specifically did not commit
to any of the things you asked.

45:16.964 --> 45:18.549
Well, what happened? Is he okay?

45:18.632 --> 45:20.843
They released him.
They told him not to leave town.

45:22.219 --> 45:24.805
- Clay!
- Hey, Tony. Tony!

45:25.681 --> 45:27.808
Look, come on. We deserve an explanation.

45:27.975 --> 45:29.476
You deserve an explanation?

45:30.436 --> 45:33.814
You got one, and I don't know why
you think you deserved it.

45:33.897 --> 45:36.525
Because we're friends!
Or I thought we were.

45:42.865 --> 45:43.865
We are. Of...

45:44.742 --> 45:45.742
Of course we are.

45:45.826 --> 45:47.466
Why didn't you tell me about the Mustang?

45:47.953 --> 45:49.037
<i>I'll take it!</i>

45:51.540 --> 45:53.420
- I'm sorry?
- The Mustang, I'll take it.

45:53.876 --> 45:54.793
Oh, that's funny.

45:54.877 --> 45:57.337
It's not, though. It's a fucking tragedy.

45:57.421 --> 46:00.883
You without your sweet red ride?
It's not a world I want to live in.

46:01.341 --> 46:04.470
- Are you just tired of it, or...
- I'm sorry, can I help you with something?

46:04.720 --> 46:06.430
Yeah, busted tail light.

46:06.638 --> 46:08.932
- You do fix cars, right?
- Maverick Autos down the road.

46:09.016 --> 46:11.769
But they're closed, you're open,
and I need it fixed fast.

46:11.852 --> 46:15.147
I'm not looking for a friend discount
or anything.

46:15.230 --> 46:16.231
Well, that's good.

46:17.691 --> 46:20.360
Man, I just need it fixed.
By tomorrow,

46:21.028 --> 46:22.404
or I'm kind of a dead man.

46:23.572 --> 46:25.032
Can I just give you the work?

46:25.365 --> 46:28.118
Or does your dad hate my guts, too?

46:30.245 --> 46:31.789
My dad's not around very much.

46:32.247 --> 46:33.373
Well, I hear that.

46:35.793 --> 46:36.794
I'm sorry.

46:40.881 --> 46:44.635
Oh, man. Okay, it's fine. Um,
I'll have it ready for you tomorrow.

46:46.428 --> 46:48.013
<i>Tony agreed to help him out.</i>

46:48.180 --> 46:49.180
Thanks.

46:50.265 --> 46:51.475
<i>He'd regret it later.</i>

46:53.393 --> 46:54.978
I understand. Thank you.

46:57.940 --> 47:00.567
They won't do anything else
unless we settle up.

47:00.943 --> 47:02.236
Fucking lawyers!

47:02.861 --> 47:04.321
Lives are in the balance.

47:05.697 --> 47:07.337
We can take money out of the gym reserve.

47:07.407 --> 47:08.992
We will do no such thing.

47:09.618 --> 47:11.203
I have...

47:11.912 --> 47:13.372
Hey, I'm sorry to interrupt.

47:14.122 --> 47:15.749
The Rover's good to go, man.

47:15.833 --> 47:18.752
- Javier will ring you up out front.
- I wanted to give you this myself.

47:19.837 --> 47:21.317
I'll take the Mustang off your hands.

47:27.427 --> 47:28.637
This is for 50.

47:29.346 --> 47:30.222
The car's 25.

47:30.305 --> 47:31.348
You don't sell that car

47:31.431 --> 47:33.934
- unless you need the money.
- I don't take fucking charity.

47:36.186 --> 47:37.980
All right. Well, what's labor here?

47:38.939 --> 47:39.939
A hundred an hour?

47:40.357 --> 47:43.151
You add up all the labor you've put
into that car over the years,

47:43.235 --> 47:46.363
especially after Monty fucking wrecked it,
and what do you get?

47:48.365 --> 47:49.365
Why?

47:51.743 --> 47:52.828
It's my dad's money.

47:54.121 --> 47:55.956
It's what he gives me to stay away.

48:00.627 --> 48:02.546
<i>Bryce was trying to make amends,</i>

48:03.046 --> 48:06.800
<i>but it wasn't until later
that he and Tony learned</i>

48:06.884 --> 48:09.136
<i>just how much he had to make amends for.</i>

48:10.053 --> 48:11.305
<i>But that's another story.</i>

48:21.690 --> 48:25.235
Thanks for driving her, Alejandro.
Thank you for everything, man.

48:25.360 --> 48:26.486
- Of course, <i>mijo.
- Gracias.</i>

48:26.570 --> 48:28.030
Her flight leaves soon, okay?

48:33.869 --> 48:37.748
You’re going to have so much fun
with <i>Tío</i> Tomás and <i> Tía</i> Marta. Right?

48:38.415 --> 48:39.917
They're so excited to see you.

48:41.501 --> 48:44.963
How long do I stay?
When are <i>Mamá</i> and <i>Papá</i> coming back?

48:53.722 --> 48:56.141
Come on, come stand next to me
like we always do.

48:56.516 --> 48:58.477
Like <i>Papá</i> taught us. Right? Come here.

49:01.104 --> 49:04.149
Arturo and Rosa Padilla
came to this country in...

49:04.232 --> 49:06.610
- 1999.
- 1999.

49:07.444 --> 49:08.779
And we have five children.

49:09.696 --> 49:10.696
Fernando.

49:12.324 --> 49:13.324
Marco.

49:15.160 --> 49:16.160
Raul.

49:17.412 --> 49:18.412
Antonio.

49:19.247 --> 49:20.958
- And...
- Graciella.

49:21.333 --> 49:22.333
Graciella.

49:24.711 --> 49:26.004
Look at how good we look.

49:26.546 --> 49:27.546
Right?

49:28.173 --> 49:29.174
You see all of us?

49:31.843 --> 49:32.843
No matter...

49:33.637 --> 49:34.637
what may come...

49:36.765 --> 49:37.766
or where we go...

49:39.726 --> 49:42.354
if it's one person in the mirror
or all of us,

49:43.146 --> 49:44.856
we remember how good we are.

49:47.609 --> 49:48.819
Graciella, look at me.

49:50.529 --> 49:54.324
I'm going to need you
to remember on your own for a little bit.

49:55.283 --> 49:57.536
- Okay?
- I want to stay with you.

49:59.037 --> 50:00.914
I would love nothing more than that.

50:02.416 --> 50:04.668
But I can't take care of you on my own.

50:06.253 --> 50:07.253
But I have a plan.

50:08.130 --> 50:09.130
So, there's hope.

50:10.090 --> 50:11.090
Okay?

50:11.591 --> 50:12.591
Okay.

50:13.135 --> 50:14.135
Come here.

50:17.931 --> 50:21.768
You are too.

50:30.110 --> 50:33.238
<i>You can tell a lot about a person
by the way they grieve.</i>

50:33.321 --> 50:36.241
When you said a piece of your heart
was in Arizona?

50:36.616 --> 50:38.952
Yeah, I couldn't give a shit
about the Mustang.

50:39.786 --> 50:40.829
And the lawyer?

50:41.705 --> 50:42.705
Was a bust.

50:43.206 --> 50:45.584
My family got deported
at the end of the summer.

50:50.255 --> 50:53.175
- Wait, why didn't you come to me?
<i>- </i> And say what, Clay?

50:55.343 --> 50:56.595
You can't save the world.

50:56.928 --> 50:59.139
But you can try to save your friends.

51:01.725 --> 51:03.310
I should've been there for you.

51:03.977 --> 51:05.353
Like you were there for me.

51:08.023 --> 51:09.023
With Hannah.

51:10.567 --> 51:11.567
I...

51:13.862 --> 51:16.448
There's a lot of shame involved,
you know?

51:16.865 --> 51:18.700
No, I don't know.

51:19.826 --> 51:21.828
Maybe that's why I didn't come to you.

51:25.874 --> 51:26.875
I love you, man.

51:30.462 --> 51:31.463

52:23.223 --> 52:24.224
At this moment?

52:25.058 --> 52:26.058
Here?

52:26.893 --> 52:27.893
I'm good.

52:32.149 --> 52:35.777

52:39.823 --> 52:41.408
<i>And I grieved for Clay Jensen.</i>

52:42.659 --> 52:44.411
We need to put Justin's picture up.

52:45.662 --> 52:46.705
That's a great idea.

52:47.622 --> 52:49.207

the digital files

53:03.346 --> 53:05.473
from the security cameras
around his house.

53:06.766 --> 53:08.435
I thought it was a waste of time.

53:09.853 --> 53:11.188

53:11.605 --> 53:14.274
It's from last spring,
