WEBVTT

06:55.707 --> 06:58.586
- Your ticket, please.
- Oh, yes.

06:58.710 --> 07:01.714
- Welcome aboard, Miss Debenham.
- Thank you.

07:01.838 --> 07:06.344
<i>Bosphorus Ferly will shortly
depart from Istanbul Sirkect Station,</i>

07:06.468 --> 07:08.846
<i>connecting with the Orient Express.</i>

07:12.057 --> 07:15.687
Here's your ticket, Monsieur Poirot.
I'm afraid you've got another hour.

07:15.810 --> 07:17.483
Well, please do not wait.

07:17.604 --> 07:20.608
Not wait? After all you've done for us,
Monsieur Poirot?

07:20.732 --> 07:22.860
<i>Oh.</i>

07:22.984 --> 07:25.737
My general's orders were
to ensure your safe departure.

07:25.862 --> 07:27.535
He also wished me to thank you again

07:27.656 --> 07:30.956
for saving the honour
of the British garrison in Jordan.

07:31.076 --> 07:35.502
The brigadier's confession was
opportune. I say, how did you do it?

07:35.622 --> 07:38.626
Was it the old thumbscrew,
you know, the rack?

07:39.751 --> 07:43.756
Yes. Well, you'll be able to rest
as soon as you get to Stamboul.

07:45.131 --> 07:50.854
The, er... The church of Santa Sofia
is absolutely magnificent.

07:50.971 --> 07:53.815
- You have seen it?
- No.

07:57.018 --> 07:58.565
<i>Come on.</i>

08:00.647 --> 08:03.446
Move. Come on.

08:03.566 --> 08:05.534
Get up. Come on.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.284
Chop-chop-

08:15.745 --> 08:17.747
Er, I hope we did the right thing,

08:17.872 --> 08:22.218
booking you into a hotel on the European
side rather than the Asian side.

08:22.335 --> 08:25.589
I have no prejudice
against either continent.

08:28.675 --> 08:33.476
The... The crossing should be pleasant.
The Bosphorus is always calm.

08:35.222 --> 08:39.023
- You have crossed by the ferry?
- No.

08:50.155 --> 08:55.787
Welcome, Colonel Arbu... Arbu...
Arbut...

08:55.910 --> 08:57.332
Arbuthnot.

09:01.249 --> 09:05.299
<i>The Bosphorus Ferry will shortly depart
for Istanbul Sirkecl' Station,</i>

09:05.420 --> 09:07.923
<i>connecting with the Orient Express.</i>

09:17.098 --> 09:22.821
Not now. Not now. When it's all over.
When it's behind us. Then.

09:29.110 --> 09:32.990
- What a funny little man.
- Obviously a frog.

10:54.487 --> 10:56.785
Good evening, sir. This way, please.

10:58.491 --> 11:02.371
<i>Ecco finalmente un amigo.</i>

11:02.495 --> 11:04.873
Monsieur Poirot!

11:04.998 --> 11:09.970
- Bianchi!
- How are you, my friend?

11:12.213 --> 11:14.887
- Good to see you.
- You have saved me from apoplexy.

11:15.008 --> 11:17.136
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

11:17.260 --> 11:20.639
- You have not dined well?
- No!

11:20.763 --> 11:23.767
The skewers are of better quality
than the kebab.

11:23.892 --> 11:26.691
The bottle is more distinguished
than its wine.

11:26.811 --> 11:30.156
And the... the <i>café?</i>

11:30.273 --> 11:33.573
Fortunately, I have been called
to London. I leave tonight.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.616
- On the Orient Express?
- How else?

11:35.737 --> 11:39.833
<i>Evviva! I have a travelling companion.
Ecceilente.</i>

11:40.783 --> 11:44.287
Well, where shall we dine?

11:56.382 --> 11:58.009
I am desolate, Monsieur Poirot.

11:58.134 --> 12:02.560
There is not one single first-class
sleeping berth on the entire train.

12:02.680 --> 12:05.809
- What? In December?
- In December, signor.

12:05.934 --> 12:10.565
Has Bulgaria declared war on Turkey?
Are the aristocracy fleeing the country?

12:10.688 --> 12:12.031
I am a director of the line.

12:12.148 --> 12:15.869
Monsieur Hercule Poirot is not only
a detective of international fame,

12:15.985 --> 12:17.487
but also my personal friend.

12:17.612 --> 12:19.410
Signor Bianchi, Monsieur Poirot...

12:19.530 --> 12:23.410
Ah, coragglo, my friend. We'll arrange
something. And Ema! We must go.

13:06.911 --> 13:11.633
<i>The Orient Express will depart
from Platform One at' 9:00pm-</i>

13:11.749 --> 13:16.380
<i>For Uzunkopru, Sofia, Belgrade,</i>

13:16.504 --> 13:23.888
<i>Zagreb, Brod, Trieste, Venice,
Milan, Lausanne,</i>

13:24.012 --> 13:29.360
<i>Basel, Paris, Calais',
with connections for London.</i>

13:59.630 --> 14:00.802
Bonsoir, Pierre.

14:00.923 --> 14:04.644
<i>Madame la Princesse, mes hommages!
Numéro quatolze.</i>

14:05.803 --> 14:08.147
<i>- Fréuie Schmidt, welkommen!
- Guten Tag.</i>

14:08.264 --> 14:09.264
<i>Bett nummer sechs.</i>

14:09.349 --> 14:11.192
<i>- Danire schdn.
- Bitte schdn.</i>

14:14.062 --> 14:18.659
<i>Orient Express departs
from Platform One at 9:00pm.</i>

15:50.241 --> 15:53.415
Ah, Mrs Hubbard.
It's always an honour to greet you.

15:53.536 --> 15:55.709
You have your favourite number, 11.

16:01.586 --> 16:06.843
<i>E000, Signor Bianchi. Benvenuto!
Numero no ve. Come sempre.</i>

16:06.966 --> 16:09.435
Grazie, Pierre. I understand
that you are full up.

16:09.552 --> 16:12.977
It's unbelievable, signor.
All the world elects to travel tonight.

16:13.097 --> 16:16.397
Nonetheless, you must find room
for Monsieur Poirot here.

16:18.269 --> 16:21.819
Monsieur Hercule Poirot?
The famous...

16:21.939 --> 16:24.818
Precisely. And he is
also a personal friend of mine.

16:24.942 --> 16:29.493
Please be so good as to direct...

16:42.752 --> 16:43.924
Something is lost?

16:44.045 --> 16:49.302
My little medal of St Christopher,
to bring me luck and deliver...

16:49.425 --> 16:50.893
deliver me from evil.

16:53.429 --> 16:56.273
Madame. Madame, lucky tooth
from St Augustine of Hippo.

16:56.390 --> 16:57.482
Lucky Buddha, Madame.

17:03.397 --> 17:07.117
Thank God, my St Christopher.
St Christopher.

17:31.968 --> 17:34.096
My friend has been urgently called
to London

17:34.220 --> 17:36.268
on a matter of international importance.

17:36.389 --> 17:38.312
I have given him my personal assurance

17:38.432 --> 17:41.777
that you will secure an accommodation
for him on the coach to Calais.

17:41.894 --> 17:44.443
- But, Signor Bianchi, I have already...
- Hector...

17:44.564 --> 17:48.285
Excuse me, gentlemen,
but Mr Ratchett has reservations,

17:48.401 --> 17:51.450
and we'd be grateful
if we could board immediately.

17:51.571 --> 17:55.496
Ah. Mr Ratchett.
Welcome to the number ten.

17:56.492 --> 17:59.541
Mr Beddoes,
the lower berth in number one.

17:59.662 --> 18:02.336
Mr McQueen,
the lower berth in number four.

18:02.456 --> 18:05.300
- The upper berth is...
- As arranged.

18:08.796 --> 18:10.093
Now, Pierre, it is cold.

18:10.214 --> 18:14.469
Now we can place Monsieur Poirot in the
number 16, which is always kept vacant.

18:14.594 --> 18:17.438
It is taken, signor,
by a Mr Hardman.

18:17.555 --> 18:21.685
Then <i>as</i> a director of the line,
I command you to place Monsieur Poirot

18:21.809 --> 18:25.780
in what we know to be the empty berth
above Mr McQueen's number four.

18:25.896 --> 18:27.443
Monsieur?

18:30.276 --> 18:32.324
At least you can get two tips.

18:47.585 --> 18:50.054
- Pardon, monsieur.
- Sorry.

18:51.839 --> 18:53.261
<i>Pardon.</i>

19:10.358 --> 19:14.033
Well, my second husband,
Mr Hubbard, would have raised hell.

19:14.153 --> 19:16.827
No place for my make-up bag,
no ice in my drinking water,

19:16.947 --> 19:19.951
and the hot water burps
as it comes out of the faucet.

19:20.076 --> 19:21.498
Pardon.

19:29.627 --> 19:32.927
Have courage, my friend.
It is the last compartment but one.

19:34.090 --> 19:35.558
<i>Pardon.</i>

19:44.975 --> 19:49.025
No. Er...
I think there's... there's a mistake.

19:52.066 --> 19:54.489
Mr McQueen,
there is no other berth on the train.

19:54.610 --> 19:58.080
Monsieur Poirot has to come in here.
Voila, monsieur, all is arranged.

19:58.197 --> 20:01.701
Yours is the upper berth,
the number four. We start in one minute.

20:01.826 --> 20:04.204
I apologise
if I have incommoded you here.

20:04.328 --> 20:07.127
However, it is for one night only
at Belgrade Station.

20:07.248 --> 20:09.342
Oh, I see. At Belgrade,
you're getting off.

22:46.073 --> 22:47.245
Better than the hotel?

22:47.366 --> 22:49.869
I shall probably keep the menu
as a souvenir.

22:52.538 --> 22:57.009
Hector, I ordered three Islamic
13th-century, perforated pottery bowls

22:57.126 --> 22:58.799
and six beakers.

22:58.919 --> 23:02.514
They delivered only five beakers,
and one of the bowls arrived chipped,

23:02.631 --> 23:06.181
which it was not when I paid for it.
Through the nose.

23:06.302 --> 23:09.602
- Send a telegram from Belgrade.
- Yes. Yes, Mr Ratchett.

23:10.681 --> 23:13.434
What's the matter? You look tired.

23:13.559 --> 23:15.857
- I slept badly.
- Yeah, why?

23:17.897 --> 23:21.527
The Belgian in the upper berth snored.

23:21.650 --> 23:24.950
Really?
Any other unanswered letters on file?

23:25.988 --> 23:30.744
- Er... Only the anonymous ones.
- We can't answer those, can we?

23:32.369 --> 23:34.792
You'd better go catch up
on your sleep

23:34.914 --> 23:38.168
before the Belgian gentleman
gets back to your compartment.

23:40.044 --> 23:41.421
Go on.

24:11.033 --> 24:15.163
Hi. My name's Hardman.
Call me Dick.

24:15.287 --> 24:18.666
- Foscarelli. Call me Gino.
- How are you?

24:20.626 --> 24:21.969
Beddoes.

24:23.212 --> 24:24.839
Mr Beddoes.

24:26.840 --> 24:30.140
Ah, for the pen of a Balzac.

24:30.260 --> 24:33.480
For three days, all these people,
these total strangers,

24:33.597 --> 24:36.897
meet in a single train
whose engine controls their destiny.

24:39.770 --> 24:43.741
Yes, I know.
We are both envious of the husband.

24:43.857 --> 24:48.363
<i>Is, er...
ls the husband as British as his tweeds?</i>

24:48.487 --> 24:50.956
Oh, heaven forbid.
He's a hot-blooded Hungarian.

24:51.073 --> 24:53.917
If you but look at his wife,
he will cease to be a diplomat.

24:54.034 --> 24:57.254
<i>Thank God we are not young.</i>

25:08.799 --> 25:13.100
My second husband said always to ask for
change in dollars or at worst, sterling.

25:13.220 --> 25:15.188
So for Pete's sake, what's a drachma?

25:15.305 --> 25:18.809
It is... What do you call it?
The currency...

25:18.934 --> 25:22.063
My second husband also said,
“Take a book of food tickets, Mama,

25:22.187 --> 25:25.361
and you'll have no problem at all."
That just isn't so.

25:25.482 --> 25:29.282
- First there's this ten-per cent tip.
- I think Miss Ohlsson has a headache.

25:29.403 --> 25:31.872
Would you forgive us if we went
to the compartment?

25:31.989 --> 25:36.119
Gladly, if you must. If you need
aspirin, I always carry it on my person.

25:36.243 --> 25:37.916
I mistrust foreign drugs.

25:38.037 --> 25:41.007
You must excuse me,
Mrs Hubbard is upon us.

25:42.750 --> 25:45.549
What's the matter with him?
Train-sick or something?

25:45.669 --> 25:49.640
Some of us, in the words of the divine
Greta Garbo, "want to be alone".

26:00.267 --> 26:02.520
And for dinner this evening?

26:02.644 --> 26:06.148
You will have the goodness
to serve me the poached sole

26:06.273 --> 26:11.404
with one new potato and a small
green salad with no dressing.

26:11.528 --> 26:12.905
Hildegarde!

26:13.030 --> 26:15.624
Who was that majestic lady?

26:15.741 --> 26:18.915
- The Princess Dragomiroff.
- Ah, I have heard.

26:37.012 --> 26:40.266
Pardon me, sir. I wonder
if you could oblige me with a light.

26:40.390 --> 26:41.892
Yes, certainly.

26:42.935 --> 26:45.529
Thank you. My name is Ratchett.

26:45.646 --> 26:48.445
Do I have the pleasure
of speaking to Mr Hercule Perrot?

26:48.565 --> 26:51.694
The pleasure possibly, Mr Ratchett,
the intention certainly.

26:51.819 --> 26:55.369
You asked me for a light. I offered
you one, and you have not used it.

26:55.489 --> 26:58.538
One can deduce that
without acute mental exhaustion.

26:58.659 --> 27:01.708
That's wonderful.
Sit down, sir.

27:01.829 --> 27:03.672
- For a moment.
- Just for a moment.

27:03.789 --> 27:05.211
Thank you very much.

27:07.084 --> 27:08.427
Well, Mr Perrot...

27:08.544 --> 27:10.797
- Poirot.
- How's that?

27:10.921 --> 27:13.800
- Poirot.
- Oh, Perrot. Right.

27:13.924 --> 27:18.395
I just wanted to say that in my country
we also come quickly to the point.

27:23.267 --> 27:26.111
I want you to take a job on for me.

27:27.271 --> 27:30.650
It means big money. Very big money.

27:30.774 --> 27:35.496
What is the case, or, as you put it,
the job which you wish me to undertake?

27:35.612 --> 27:38.707
Mr Poirot, I'm a rich man.

27:38.824 --> 27:42.579
Naturally,
men in my position have enemies.

27:42.703 --> 27:46.708
- Only one.
- What the hell do you mean by that?

27:46.832 --> 27:50.462
Merely that when a man is in a position
to have, as you say, enemies,

27:50.586 --> 27:55.638
it does not usually resolve itself
into one enemy only.

27:55.757 --> 27:59.136
Oh. Oh, sure. Sure. I appreciate that.

27:59.261 --> 28:01.184
What is your profession?

28:02.347 --> 28:03.815
I'm retired.

28:03.932 --> 28:05.900
- From what?
- Business.

28:07.019 --> 28:10.865
- What sort of business?
- Baby food.

28:10.981 --> 28:13.655
But what does that matter?
What matters is my safety.

28:13.775 --> 28:14.947
You are in danger?

28:15.068 --> 28:17.287
My life has been threatened, Mr Poirot.

28:17.404 --> 28:21.659
My secretary can show you
two letters on file.

28:23.076 --> 28:26.831
<i>And I... can show you this.</i>

28:29.875 --> 28:31.627
I sleep on it.

28:33.670 --> 28:35.343
Mr Poirot...

28:36.965 --> 28:38.592
$5,000.

28:40.052 --> 28:43.181
No? 10,000?

28:44.640 --> 28:46.608
15,000.

28:46.725 --> 28:49.524
Mr Ratchett, I have made enough money

28:49.645 --> 28:52.364
to satisfy both my needs
and my caprices.

28:52.481 --> 28:55.155
<i>I take only such cases now
as interest me,</i>

28:55.275 --> 29:01.533
and, to be frank, my interest
in your case is... dwindling.

29:48.996 --> 29:54.127
<i>Belgrade Station. The Orient'
Express will depart in five minutes.</i>

29:59.715 --> 30:01.092
Ah, Monsieur Poirot!

30:01.216 --> 30:04.311
I am transferring Signor Bianchi's
luggage to the Pullman.

30:04.428 --> 30:07.898
- He's giving you his own compartment.
- But you cannot sit up all night!

30:08.015 --> 30:10.939
Ah, my dear friend,
do not concern yourself.

30:11.059 --> 30:14.609
It is better for you to stay
on the through coach to Calais.

30:14.730 --> 30:16.824
Now, Pierre has made me
very comfortable.

30:16.940 --> 30:19.910
There is no one in the Pullman
but one Greek doctor. E000.

30:20.027 --> 30:23.529
- Such generosity deserves my thanks.
<i>- Buon</i> riposa.

30:23.530 --> 30:25.570
- Such generosity deserves my thanks.
<i>- Buon</i> riposa.

30:52.726 --> 30:54.069
Monsieur Poirot.

30:54.186 --> 30:56.234
Pierre, could I have some clean towels?

30:56.355 --> 31:00.110
- Yes, monsieur.
- Who are my new neighbours?

31:00.233 --> 31:03.237
To the left, monsieur,
the Swedish lady, Miss Ohlsson,

31:03.362 --> 31:06.457
shares seven and eight
with the English lady, Miss Debenham.

31:06.573 --> 31:09.417
And to the right, in number ten,
is Mr Ratchett.

31:09.534 --> 31:13.380
Where is the loquacious Mrs Hubbard?
I should like to get some sleep tonight.

31:13.497 --> 31:17.252
- Beyond Mr Ratchett, in the number 11.
- She is still too near.

31:17.376 --> 31:20.721
- Goodnight, Mr Beddoes.
- Ah, <i>pardon.</i>

31:27.928 --> 31:29.020
<i>Who is it?</i>

31:29.137 --> 31:31.640
It's me, sir, Beddoes,
with your sedative.

31:35.185 --> 31:36.653
Come in.

31:41.608 --> 31:43.155
Thank you, Pierre. Goodnight.

31:43.276 --> 31:47.577
Goodnight, monsieur,
and pleasant dreams in number nine.

31:49.574 --> 31:50.917
How many drops?

31:51.034 --> 31:53.753
Of the Valerian?
Two, sir, as you said.

31:53.870 --> 31:54.917
<i>OK</i>

31:56.915 --> 31:58.917
No, no. Put it on the table.

32:05.090 --> 32:06.216
And tell Mr McQueen

32:06.341 --> 32:09.845
I want to see the text
of the telegram he sent from Belgrade.

32:13.348 --> 32:14.895
Very well, sir.

32:24.568 --> 32:26.115
He wants you.

32:57.601 --> 32:59.524
<i>Come in.</i>

33:16.536 --> 33:19.005
<i>Ah, tiens, tiens, tiens.</i>

33:32.677 --> 33:34.600
<i>La belle Comtesse-</i>

34:34.906 --> 34:37.830
<i>Ce n'est rien.
Cétait un cauchemar.</i>

34:39.995 --> 34:43.670
Ah, bien, Mr Ratchett.
May you now have pleasant dreams.

34:59.973 --> 35:02.226
<i>C'est le silence de mart.</i>

35:18.783 --> 35:23.505
<i>A snowdrift?
Mon Dieu. Ouelie nui't!</i>

35:28.168 --> 35:31.513
So now there's a man in my room.
I woke up in the dark three minutes ago,

35:31.630 --> 35:34.133
and there was a man in
this compartment. I sensed it.

35:34.257 --> 35:36.009
What's more, I know who he was

35:36.134 --> 35:38.353
because I nearly walked through
his door.

35:38.470 --> 35:42.316
"Madame," said Mr Ratchett, "if this was
20 years ago, I'd have said come in."

35:42.432 --> 35:45.151
Twenty years ago? Ha!
Why, I'd only have been 15.

35:46.770 --> 35:51.241
If there should be a reoccurrence,
do not hesitate to ring, madame.

35:58.281 --> 36:00.409
<i>Enfin c'est le comble!</i>

36:17.634 --> 36:20.262
<i>Evidemment, j'ai une crise de nerfs.</i>

36:46.246 --> 36:49.125
It's me, sir, Beddoes,
with your pick-me-up.

36:54.921 --> 36:56.844
Your Amber Moon, Mr Ratchett.

37:15.275 --> 37:16.322
Your passkey.

37:22.365 --> 37:23.958
The chain.

37:31.916 --> 37:34.214
Dare touch nothing.

37:38.298 --> 37:41.347
Where are Signor Bianchi
and the Greek doctor?

37:41.468 --> 37:44.597
- In the dining car, monsieur.
- Fetch them at once.

38:04.491 --> 38:06.539
Well, can't you tap the telephone wires?

38:06.659 --> 38:09.663
- Or fire a rocket, or something?
- This is not a ship, madame.

38:09.788 --> 38:11.916
We are between Vinkovci and Brod.

38:12.040 --> 38:14.509
- But in what country?
- In Yugoslavia.

38:14.626 --> 38:16.754
The Balkans. What else can you expect'?

38:16.878 --> 38:19.597
Snow is God's will.
And all is for the best.

38:19.714 --> 38:23.139
Yeah, but how long do you think
before we can start getting out of here?

38:23.259 --> 38:26.638
As soon <i>as</i> the stationmaster at Brod
sees that we do not arrive on time,

38:26.763 --> 38:27.763
he will send...

38:30.099 --> 38:33.603
Dr Constantine,
Monsieur Poirot wants to see you.

38:33.728 --> 38:36.277
And you too, Signor Bianchi.

38:36.397 --> 38:38.650
Forgive me,
ladies and gentlemen.

38:38.775 --> 38:42.029
Only God's forgiveness is important.

38:42.153 --> 38:45.282
<i>Ich mdchte
mei'ne Prinzessin benachrichtigen.</i>

38:48.535 --> 38:50.754
Signor Bianchi and Dr Constantine.

38:50.870 --> 38:52.964
Mind the broken glass, gentlemen.

38:57.502 --> 39:01.973
Pupils still slightly dilated.
Could've been drugged.

39:02.090 --> 39:04.138
- Was drugged.
- With what?

39:05.593 --> 39:08.563
<i>There's a smell of valerian,</i>

39:08.680 --> 39:11.559
which is harmless,
but something must've been added.

39:11.683 --> 39:14.937
- May I close his eyes now?
- I wish you would.

39:18.439 --> 39:20.692
Why did he lose so much blood?

39:20.817 --> 39:24.117
- Can I pull back the bedclothes?
- By all means.

39:29.534 --> 39:36.634
Mr Ratchett has been frontally stabbed
ten, eleven, twelve times.

39:36.749 --> 39:38.672
<i>- 0h, Dio.
- Mon pauvre.</i>

39:38.793 --> 39:40.636
If you must go whoop-whoop,

39:40.753 --> 39:43.506
please go whoop-whoop not to windward,
but to leeward.

39:43.631 --> 39:45.224
Help him, Pierre.

39:48.052 --> 39:51.898
- There is something in the pocket.
- Permit me.

39:57.228 --> 40:00.402
- His watch.
- The time of death.

40:00.523 --> 40:05.029
I can definitely say that death occurred
between midnight and two in the morning.

40:05.153 --> 40:06.496
That would fit.

40:07.739 --> 40:13.667
I myself heard him cry out
and ring for the conductor at 12:40.

40:14.954 --> 40:19.881
When Pierre arrived, he apologised and
said he had been having a cauchemar.

40:20.001 --> 40:21.799
A nightmare.

40:24.505 --> 40:28.305
Then I heard him use his washbasin.

40:30.219 --> 40:32.563
And that is the last thing known.

40:36.768 --> 40:39.567
I beg of you, monsieur.
You cannot refuse.

40:39.687 --> 40:42.361
But it is the duty
of the Yugoslavian police.

40:42.482 --> 40:46.407
Oh, what, monsieur,
to question my passengers on my line?

40:46.527 --> 40:50.703
Never. Now, you must solve the mystery.

40:50.823 --> 40:56.250
When we get to Brod, if we ever do, we
present the police with a fait accompli.

40:56.371 --> 41:00.626
We say that a murder has occurred.
There is the criminal.

41:01.960 --> 41:06.010
I should like the Pullman coach reserved
for the investigation's headquarters.

41:06.130 --> 41:07.848
It will be at your disposal.

41:07.966 --> 41:11.561
And a plan of the coach with the names
and locations of all the people in it.

41:11.678 --> 41:12.804
Yes, it will be there.

41:12.929 --> 41:15.352
And the passports
of all passengers concerned.

41:15.473 --> 41:18.647
You can even have mine.
I go to make a special announcement now.

41:18.768 --> 41:21.442
Grazia. Bring all the passports
to Monsieur Poirot.

41:21.562 --> 41:24.190
Are there any other passengers
on the train?

41:24.315 --> 41:27.819
<i>In</i> the Pullman coach,
nobody but myself and Mr Bianchi.

41:36.244 --> 41:40.215
Alors. Then we must concentrate
on the Calais coach.

41:40.331 --> 41:45.929
Where, in my amateur opinion,
the murderer is with us now.

41:48.464 --> 41:53.561
Ladies and gentlemen. Please, please,
patience. You must have patience.

41:53.678 --> 41:57.148
Now, you will all get the chance
to state your views to Monsieur Poirot

41:57.265 --> 41:58.517
at his own good time.

41:58.641 --> 42:03.738
It is not good time. It is bad time.
God's laws have been bust.

42:03.855 --> 42:05.607
Thou shalt not kill.

42:05.732 --> 42:09.236
And wh-why was I not notified at once,
Signor... Mr Bianchi?

42:09.360 --> 42:13.706
- I was his nearest associate.
- And I was nearest to his murderer.

42:15.742 --> 42:19.292
You mean you saw the man?
You can identify the murderer?

42:19.412 --> 42:21.085
I mean nothing of the kind.

42:21.205 --> 42:23.879
I mean there was a man
in my compartment last night.

42:24.000 --> 42:27.129
It was pitch-dark, of course,
and my eyes were closed in terror.

42:27.253 --> 42:29.221
Then how did you know it was a man?

42:29.338 --> 42:33.684
Because I've enjoyed very warm
relationships with both my husbands.

42:33.801 --> 42:36.771
- With your eyes closed'?
- That helped.

42:36.888 --> 42:39.687
- Excuse me.
- Anyway, the man smelt of tobacco.

42:39.807 --> 42:43.653
Mr McQueen, Monsieur Poirot would be
grateful for a few minutes of your time.

42:46.272 --> 42:47.068
Excuse me.

42:47.190 --> 42:50.569
The man must've entered my compartment
to gain access to Mr Ratchett.

42:50.693 --> 42:54.197
I can think of no other reason, madame.

42:54.322 --> 42:56.324
Pierre, your passkey.

42:57.492 --> 42:59.460
<i>Voila', monsieur.</i>

42:59.577 --> 43:04.834
And will you discreetly procure me
a lady's hatbox,

43:04.957 --> 43:07.301
one of the big, old-fashioned kind,

43:07.418 --> 43:10.046
perhaps from the Princess
Dragomiroffs maid?

43:11.756 --> 43:13.804
Give me five minutes, doctor.

43:13.925 --> 43:16.144
Mr McQueen,
I regret to have kept you waiting,

43:16.260 --> 43:18.354
but there has been much to establish.

43:19.514 --> 43:20.766
Please be seated.

43:20.890 --> 43:25.111
Now, I should be grateful for anything
you can tell me. What, for example...

43:25.228 --> 43:28.778
Let's get just a couple of things
straight first, Mr Poirot.

43:28.898 --> 43:32.152
Who, for example, are you,
and what is your status here?

43:32.276 --> 43:34.404
Excuse me.

43:34.529 --> 43:36.657
Monsieur Poirot is a detective,

43:36.781 --> 43:39.705
officially delegated
to investigate this case by me.

43:39.826 --> 43:43.421
Let us proceed with the matter in hand.
Your relationship with Ratchett?

43:43.538 --> 43:45.085
I'm his... I was his secretary.

43:45.206 --> 43:47.049
- For how long?
- A year, give or take.

43:47.166 --> 43:49.589
- Where did you meet?
- In Persia.

43:49.710 --> 43:53.385
He was collecting Gorgan pottery
with considerable success.

43:53.506 --> 43:55.725
And I was trying to collect
oil concessions

43:55.842 --> 43:59.437
with so little success that I went
bankrupt, and he offered me the job.

43:59.554 --> 44:00.350
I took it.

44:00.471 --> 44:03.850
- And since then?
- Well, we've travelled around.

44:03.975 --> 44:06.273
He was hampered
by not knowing any languages.

44:06.394 --> 44:08.772
I acted more as his courier
than as his secretary.

44:08.896 --> 44:10.398
It was a pleasant enough job.

44:10.523 --> 44:13.242
What part of America
did Ratchett come from?

44:13.359 --> 44:18.741
I don't know. The fact is,
he never talked about his background.

44:18.865 --> 44:22.119
- Why, do you think?
- Well, I used to...

44:22.243 --> 44:25.497
Well, I began to believe
that he had left America

44:25.621 --> 44:27.874
to escape something, you know,
or someone.

44:27.999 --> 44:30.969
And until a couple of weeks ago,
I think he succeeded.

44:31.085 --> 44:32.302
And then?

44:32.420 --> 44:35.219
Well, he began to get
these anonymous letters,

44:35.339 --> 44:38.218
threatening letters, like these.

44:40.720 --> 44:42.438
"I kill killers."

44:42.555 --> 44:43.852
Mm-hmm.

44:45.850 --> 44:47.898
"Prepare to die."

44:48.019 --> 44:51.740
- How brief.
- But in a sense, how complicated.

44:51.856 --> 44:57.033
Last night, I noticed you dispatching
a telegram from Belgrade Station.

44:57.153 --> 45:00.748
That's right. Let's see,
he sent for me to see the text

45:00.865 --> 45:02.833
right after we left Belgrade.

45:02.950 --> 45:06.545
And then he went, <i>er...</i>
Yeah, it was the last I ever saw of him.

45:06.662 --> 45:09.586
Were there any other
threatening letters?

45:09.707 --> 45:12.085
Yeah, but none that I was
allowed to read.

45:12.210 --> 45:14.212
He used to... He used to burn them.

45:14.337 --> 45:16.681
- That explains...
- What?

45:19.550 --> 45:21.894
My interest in hatboxes.

45:26.140 --> 45:28.142
Precisely what I needed.

45:31.103 --> 45:33.856
[Poirot? Doctor, first the wounds.
You counted a dozen?

45:33.981 --> 45:34.982
<i>Yes.</i>

45:35.107 --> 45:41.205
Five are deep,
of which three are lethal.

45:43.241 --> 45:46.541
The rest are shallow. And two...

45:47.745 --> 45:51.795
are so slight as to be mere scratches.

45:51.916 --> 45:54.089
What does that suggest?

45:54.210 --> 46:00.058
That there were two murderers,
a strong man and a weak man?

46:00.174 --> 46:02.302
<i>Or a weak woman.</i>

46:02.426 --> 46:08.479
Or a strong man stabbing
the victim both strongly and weakly

46:08.599 --> 46:11.352
in order to confuse us.

46:11.477 --> 46:15.573
At least we know that by the time
of the murder,

46:15.690 --> 46:18.443
Ratchett was too drugged to cry out

46:18.567 --> 46:23.198
or defend himself with this.

46:23.322 --> 46:25.416
- But how did you guess?
- I didn't.

46:25.533 --> 46:29.629
He showed it to me when he offered me
$15,000 to be his bodyguard

46:29.745 --> 46:30.917
and I refused.

46:31.038 --> 46:33.257
Ought I to have accepted?

46:41.090 --> 46:44.640
Now, let us consider the ashtray.

46:44.760 --> 46:49.482
Two different matches. A smoked cigar.

46:49.598 --> 46:51.976
- A pipe cleaner...
- And this.

46:52.101 --> 46:53.273
Huh?

46:56.856 --> 46:59.700
- The initial H.
- That should not be hard to identify.

46:59.817 --> 47:02.036
I wonder, Christian name or surname?

47:03.237 --> 47:06.366
We must wait until we examine
the passports.

47:06.490 --> 47:11.166
Bianchi, doctor, has it occurred to you

47:11.287 --> 47:16.509
that there are too many clues
in this room?

47:18.044 --> 47:23.596
Let us proceed by examining what I hope
will prove to be the last of them.

47:23.716 --> 47:26.060
The burnt paper.

47:32.224 --> 47:34.226
I use it for the moustaches.

47:34.352 --> 47:38.232
- What has that to do with moustaches?
- To melt the wax.

48:04.048 --> 48:07.678
Observe, memorise,
you are my only witnesses.

48:07.802 --> 48:11.727
- A-I-S-Y A-R-M-S.
- What does that mean?

48:13.641 --> 48:18.898
It means we know the true identity
of Mr Ratchett.

48:20.523 --> 48:23.868
And why he had to leave America.

48:28.489 --> 48:31.163
Do you remember the Armstrong case?

48:32.243 --> 48:38.626
Of course, the kidnapping of that
little American girl, and the killing.

48:38.749 --> 48:39.796
Who does not?

48:39.917 --> 48:46.050
- Do you remember the name of the child?
- Celtamente. It was Daisy.

48:46.173 --> 48:47.675
ID-

48:47.800 --> 48:52.522
D-A-I-S-Y.

48:54.098 --> 48:58.274
Space, A-R-M-S.

48:58.394 --> 49:00.396
Daisy Armstrong.

49:02.398 --> 49:03.991
And Ratchett was her murderer?

49:04.108 --> 49:09.205
Well, no, the actual murderer was tried,
sentenced and electrocuted.

49:09.321 --> 49:11.574
But he was only the number two.

49:11.699 --> 49:15.374
The subordinate of a boss whom, at
first, he was too terrified to identify.

49:15.494 --> 49:18.839
Only on the eve of his electrocution
did he give the name of the boss,

49:18.956 --> 49:22.506
who by then had disappeared
with the ransom money.

49:22.626 --> 49:25.630
I remember feeling ashamed
that he had an Italian name.

49:25.754 --> 49:26.754
Cassetti.

49:26.839 --> 49:30.594
Che mostro.
He had a child's blood on his hands.

49:31.969 --> 49:34.518
He had worse than that.

49:34.638 --> 49:38.017
After the shock of the body's discovery,

49:38.142 --> 49:42.613
Mrs Armstrong gave premature birth
to a stillborn child

49:42.730 --> 49:45.700
and herself died in the process.

49:45.816 --> 49:49.741
Her husband, Colonel Armstrong,
once a brave officer in the Scots Guard,

49:49.862 --> 49:51.239
shot himself.

49:51.363 --> 49:57.416
Mrs Armstrong's personal maid, who came
wrongly under suspicion of complicity,

49:57.536 --> 50:02.508
threw herself from her bedroom window
and she died, so five deaths, five.

50:02.625 --> 50:07.381
Then I thank heaven that Cassetti,
who spilt so much blood in his lifetime,

50:07.505 --> 50:09.257
should have his own blood spilt now.

50:24.563 --> 50:28.443
Excellent, Pierre. And could you summon
the passengers to me here,

50:28.567 --> 50:31.616
one by one in this order,
except for the Princess Dragomiroff,

50:31.737 --> 50:36.163
who is not only of royal blood, but also
much older than she tries not to look.

50:36.283 --> 50:40.288
And, Pierre, since you are here already,

50:40.412 --> 50:44.337
we can conveniently start
by questioning you.

50:44.458 --> 50:47.587
Your full name is Pierre Paul Michel.

50:49.505 --> 50:53.100
- Correct, monsieur.
- Two male saints' names.

50:53.217 --> 50:54.685
You must be greatly blessed.

50:54.802 --> 50:57.726
I've had my share of good fortune,
monsieur.

50:57.846 --> 50:59.723
So... And of bad.

50:59.848 --> 51:05.070
I note the cancellation of your wife's
photograph nearly five years ago.

51:05.187 --> 51:08.817
- She is deceased.
- She died, monsieur.

51:10.234 --> 51:14.785
Of grief at the death
of our only daughter.

51:16.198 --> 51:17.825
From scarlet fever.

51:21.245 --> 51:23.213
I am truly sorry.

51:27.668 --> 51:31.013
Let us talk of less distressing matters.

51:31.130 --> 51:34.100
On the night of the murder,
after we left Belgrade,

51:34.216 --> 51:36.969
who were the last people to retire
to their compartment?

51:37.094 --> 51:39.392
Show me on the diagram.

51:39.513 --> 51:43.188
About 1:30, I remember seeing
the English colonel

51:43.309 --> 51:47.906
<i>say goodnight to Mr McQueen
outside number three and four.</i>

51:48.022 --> 51:52.402
<i>I saw him walk back
into his compartment, number 1.5</i>

51:52.526 --> 51:54.369
<i>which he did not leave.</i>

51:54.486 --> 51:57.490
And after that, did no one re-emerge?

51:58.574 --> 52:03.796
No, but there was one lady
who opened a door, I don't know which,

52:03.912 --> 52:06.756
and walked in the direction
of the toilet

52:06.874 --> 52:09.468
<i>at the far end of the corridor,
next to the dining car.</i>

52:09.585 --> 52:12.839
<i>- Did you see her return?
- No, monsieur.</i>

52:12.963 --> 52:15.261
It is possible I was answering a bell.

52:16.634 --> 52:18.728
That reminds me of a final point.

52:18.844 --> 52:20.687
Much earlier, soon after 12:30,

52:20.804 --> 52:23.683
you and I both heard Mr Ratchett
ring his bell several times

52:23.807 --> 52:25.980
and apologise for having had
a nightmare.

52:35.611 --> 52:38.239
<i>Ce n 'est rien.
Cétait un cauchemar.</i>

52:38.364 --> 52:42.710
Who rang the second bell
while you were answering Mr Ratchett's?

52:42.826 --> 52:47.582
The Princess Dragomiroff, monsieur.
She asked me to summon her maid.

52:49.500 --> 52:51.878
Thank you, Pierre.
That is all for the moment.

53:01.595 --> 53:05.099
He had the means to do it.
The passkey to Ratchetfs room.

53:05.224 --> 53:08.444
- And a knife borrowed from the chef.
- With whom he was in league.

53:08.560 --> 53:12.440
Which he plunged repeatedly
and without motive into the body

53:12.564 --> 53:14.316
of his suitably astonished victim.

53:14.441 --> 53:18.491
Anyway, we know the door was
not only locked, but chained.

53:19.488 --> 53:21.240
Mr McQueen.

53:21.365 --> 53:22.867
Since our last conversation,

53:22.991 --> 53:25.790
I have learnt the true identity
of your late employer.

53:26.745 --> 53:29.919
- You don't say.
- Mm.

53:30.040 --> 53:35.217
Ratchett was, <i>as</i> you yourself suspected,
merely an alias.

53:35.337 --> 53:36.714
He was, in fact, Cassetti.

53:36.839 --> 53:38.967
The gangster who masterminded

53:39.091 --> 53:42.766
the kidnapping and killing
of little Daisy Armstrong.

53:42.886 --> 53:45.139
You had no idea of this?

53:46.473 --> 53:48.225
No, sir.

53:48.350 --> 53:53.948
If I had, I'd have cut off my right hand
so I couldn't type his lousy letters.

53:54.982 --> 53:56.700
And I'd have killed him with my left.

53:56.817 --> 54:00.492
You feel you could have done
the good deed yourself?

54:02.948 --> 54:05.701
It seems like I'm kind of
incriminating myself.

54:05.826 --> 54:08.375
I should be more inclined
to suspect you, Mr McQueen,

54:08.495 --> 54:12.090
if you displayed an inordinate sorrow
at your employer's decease.

54:12.207 --> 54:13.550
Sorrow?

54:16.003 --> 54:19.849
My dad, my father,
was the district attorney, yeah,

54:19.965 --> 54:22.969
who handled the Armstrong case.

54:23.093 --> 54:25.767
Mrs Armstrong and her husband
came to our house twice

54:25.888 --> 54:28.437
for advice about the ransom money.

54:28.557 --> 54:31.401
She was gentle and frightened.

54:32.478 --> 54:35.448
But not too frightened
to take an interest

54:35.564 --> 54:38.693
in a young man who wanted
to go on the stage.

54:40.819 --> 54:42.617
She even said she'd write to...

54:43.781 --> 54:45.829
She died before she got around to that.

54:45.949 --> 54:51.752
She was <i>as</i> helpful to me as a...
Well, a mother.

54:51.872 --> 54:53.499
Forgive a Freudian question.

54:53.624 --> 54:58.300
- Do you love your mother?
- I did.

54:58.420 --> 55:03.472
She died when I was eight.
An impressionable age. Why do you ask?

55:03.592 --> 55:06.436
We shared a compartment
on the first night of our journey.

55:06.553 --> 55:10.558
You cried out to your mother
twice in your sleep.

55:10.682 --> 55:11.774
Did I?

55:13.227 --> 55:15.650
I still dream about her.

55:15.771 --> 55:16.772
Go on.

55:16.897 --> 55:20.618
Tell me. I'm emotionally retarded.
Tell me that's why I never married.

55:20.734 --> 55:25.365
I am not here to tell you anything,
Mr McQueen. You are here to tell me.

55:27.449 --> 55:29.372
Yeah, I'm sorry.

55:29.493 --> 55:31.712
Yeah, there's just one thing.

55:31.829 --> 55:33.376
How did you, <i>er...</i>

55:34.665 --> 55:36.963
figure out Ratchett's identity?

55:37.084 --> 55:39.837
By a message found in his compartment.

55:41.755 --> 55:44.224
He'd have burnt that, though,
as I told you.

55:44.341 --> 55:46.093
Mm. He did.

55:47.594 --> 55:48.891
Yeah, he did.

55:49.930 --> 55:53.025
- Then how did you decipher?
- With the help of a hatbox.

55:53.141 --> 55:55.064
Thank you, Mr McQueen.

56:01.483 --> 56:05.329
He did it. He murdered Cassetti.
He practically confessed as much.

56:05.445 --> 56:08.745
No, the psychology is wrong.

56:08.866 --> 56:12.996
A sensitive, motherless boy
conceives a passion for a lady

56:13.120 --> 56:15.964
whom he admires above all
for her gentleness.

56:16.081 --> 56:21.008
Now, could McQueen, admiring the
gentleness, commit so foul a murder

56:21.128 --> 56:26.601
without betraying the gentleness of
what we might call his fairy godmother?

56:26.717 --> 56:29.596
Ah! Godmother.

56:30.721 --> 56:35.352
Now you have accidentally said
something valuable. Come.

56:39.104 --> 56:42.153
Mr Beddoes, this is not an inquisition,
only an inquiry.

56:44.484 --> 56:49.615
When you took Mr Ratchett his Valerian
drops about 9:40 yesterday evening,

56:49.740 --> 56:51.117
was he already in bed?

56:51.241 --> 56:54.370
That is so, sir. Mr Ratchett
always retired early on trains.

56:54.494 --> 56:57.168
What were your duties
before leaving him for the night?

56:57.289 --> 56:59.542
To place the Valerian drops
within reach, sir.

56:59.666 --> 57:01.293
- Beddoes?
- Sir.

57:01.418 --> 57:03.921
Did you put this on my table
during dinner?

57:04.046 --> 57:06.219
- No, sir.
- Then who the hell did?

57:06.340 --> 57:10.345
I have no idea, sir.
May I ask what it is?

57:10.469 --> 57:12.471
What it is
is none of your damn business.

57:12.596 --> 57:14.189
I want to know how it got here.

57:18.435 --> 57:20.779
- Will there be anything more, sir?
- There will.

57:20.896 --> 57:25.072
- Tell Mr McQueen I wanna see him, now.
- Very well, sir.

57:26.610 --> 57:29.363
What time would you like to be
called in the morning, sir?

57:29.488 --> 57:32.412
- Not before ten.
- Very good, sir.

57:32.532 --> 57:35.331
- Was that usual?
- Oh, quite, sir, yes.

57:35.452 --> 57:37.500
His breakfast was his Amber Moon.

57:37.621 --> 57:39.840
He never rose until it had had
its full effect.

57:39.957 --> 57:45.760
So you instructed Mr McQueen and then
returned to your own compartment,

57:45.879 --> 57:51.386
the number one and two, whose upper
berth was occupied by Signor Foscarelli.

57:51.510 --> 57:55.515
- Oh, yes, sir, the Italian person.
- Does he speak English?

57:55.639 --> 57:59.815
A kind of English, sir. I think
he learnt it in a place called Chicago.

57:59.935 --> 58:03.735
- Did you talk together much?
- Oh, no, sir. I prefer to read.

58:09.194 --> 58:11.822
Hey, what are you reading, Mr Beddoes?

58:12.990 --> 58:16.540
<i>Love's</i> Captive,
by Mrs Arabella Richardson.

58:16.660 --> 58:21.040
- Is it about sex?
- No, it's about 10:30, Mr Foscarelli.

58:24.334 --> 58:28.464
I like that.
"it's about 10:30!"

58:30.966 --> 58:34.971
- And after that you went to sleep.
- Oh, no. Not until four in the morning.

58:35.095 --> 58:37.063
Unfortunately, I had the toothache.

58:37.180 --> 58:41.401
- And your companion?
- He snored incessantly.

58:41.518 --> 58:46.695
One final point. How did you come
to be employed by Mr Ratchett?

58:46.815 --> 58:49.409
Through Maibaums, sir,
the big agency in New York.

58:49.526 --> 58:52.154
- You'll find me on their books.
- And before then?

58:52.279 --> 58:54.452
I was in the army, sir,
as a private soldier.

58:54.573 --> 58:56.917
- Where?
- Troon, sir.

58:57.034 --> 58:59.503
- In the Far East?
- Oh, no, sir, in Scotland.

58:59.619 --> 59:04.295
Oh, Scotland. Oh, forgive me.
I am only an ignorant Belgian.

59:04.416 --> 59:07.590
Oh, a Belgian, sir?
I always thought you were French.

59:07.711 --> 59:09.179
Belgian.

59:09.296 --> 59:12.891
Did you know that Mr Ratchett
was of Italian extraction?

59:13.008 --> 59:15.181
So that accounts for his hot temper.

59:17.554 --> 59:21.980
His real name was Cassetti.
The name means nothing to you?

59:23.643 --> 59:27.693
- Do you remember the Armstrong case?
- No, sir.

59:27.814 --> 59:31.990
Oh, yes, yes. The little girl.

59:32.110 --> 59:36.707
Cassetti was responsible for her murder.

59:37.866 --> 59:39.834
How does that strike you?

59:39.951 --> 59:43.455
I think that instead of our employers
requiring references from us,

59:43.580 --> 59:45.548
we should require references from them.

59:48.585 --> 59:49.962
Thank you, Mr Beddoes.

59:50.087 --> 59:52.715
Please don't get up, sir.
Will there be anything else?

59:52.839 --> 59:54.591
No, that is all.

59:58.220 --> 01:00:00.314
He did it. The butler did it.

01:00:01.598 --> 01:00:03.566
He had constant access to Ratchett.

01:00:03.683 --> 01:00:07.062
He could have poisoned the valerian
before bringing it to his master.

01:00:07.187 --> 01:00:09.360
As for the psychological,

01:00:09.481 --> 01:00:12.655
well, who knows what boils and bubbles
beneath that stiff shirt

01:00:12.776 --> 01:00:14.699
to which his profession has called him.

01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:17.323
<i>Did he not read Loveis Captive? Hmm?</i>

01:00:17.447 --> 01:00:20.576
When you suggest he should
have been stabbing Mr Ratchett?

01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:46.189
I fear that help is at hand.

01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:49.404
Even if it is only a working party
with picks and shovels,

01:00:49.521 --> 01:00:53.116
we must make haste to complete
this inquiry before we reach Brod.

01:00:53.233 --> 01:00:56.578
If it is an engine with a snowplough,
our troubles will really begin.

01:00:56.695 --> 01:00:58.038
<i>Who's</i> next?

01:00:58.155 --> 01:00:59.953
- Mrs Hubbard-
- Oh, my God.

01:01:01.283 --> 01:01:03.661
The whistle means that help is near,
madame.

01:01:03.785 --> 01:01:04.832
And high time, too.

01:01:04.953 --> 01:01:07.502
Time is what counts if we are
to complete this inquiry

01:01:07.622 --> 01:01:08.714
before reaching Brod.

01:01:08.832 --> 01:01:11.756
I will therefore make
my questions brief

01:01:11.877 --> 01:01:14.551
and you can confine yourself
to a simple yes or no.

01:01:14.671 --> 01:01:16.093
Don't waste time yammering.

01:01:16.214 --> 01:01:18.888
Your full name is
Harriet Belinda Hubbard?

01:01:19.009 --> 01:01:20.886
Yes. I was called Harriet after <i>my...</i>

01:01:21.011 --> 01:01:23.480
By now, Mr McQueen has
doubtless informed you

01:01:23.597 --> 01:01:26.646
- of the true identity of Mr Ratchett?
- Yes, that low-down...

01:01:26.766 --> 01:01:28.814
Were you acquainted with the Armstrongs?

01:01:28.935 --> 01:01:30.653
No, of course not. They were <i>a...</i>

01:01:30.770 --> 01:01:33.865
I overheard the whole
of your conversation with Pierre

01:01:33.982 --> 01:01:35.655
about there being a man in your room

01:01:35.775 --> 01:01:38.198
soon after one o'clock
on the night of the murder.

01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:39.412
Tell me one thing more.

01:01:39.529 --> 01:01:41.782
Wasn't the door locked
on your side of the door

01:01:41.907 --> 01:01:44.626
that communicated
with Mr Ratchett's compartment?

01:01:44.743 --> 01:01:48.748
- Yes, so far <i>as</i> I know. My second...
- What do you mean, as far as you know?

01:01:48.872 --> 01:01:51.466
Could you not see the bolt from the bed?

01:01:51.583 --> 01:01:53.961
- No.
- Why?

01:01:54.085 --> 01:01:56.554
It was masked by my make-up bag
on the hook above.

01:01:56.671 --> 01:01:57.797
Pierre checked the bolt

01:01:57.923 --> 01:02:00.972
after I told him there had been
a man hiding in my compartment.

01:02:01.092 --> 01:02:02.765
Yes, yes, we know all about that.

01:02:03.970 --> 01:02:07.440
- Oh, no, you don't.
- I beg your pardon?

01:02:07.557 --> 01:02:09.810
You don't know what I found this morning

01:02:09.935 --> 01:02:12.939
on top of the magazine
I'd been reading to send myself asleep.

01:02:13.063 --> 01:02:14.189
What?

01:02:24.157 --> 01:02:26.205
O h, <i>dio mio.</i>

01:02:26.326 --> 01:02:31.583
This is a button
from the tunic of a wagon-lit conductor.

01:02:31.706 --> 01:02:35.961
Doctor, would you kindly enquire
whether Pierre has lost a tunic button?

01:02:36.086 --> 01:02:37.383
Gladly.

01:02:44.928 --> 01:02:46.896
Your handkerchief, Mrs Hubbard.

01:02:47.013 --> 01:02:49.516
Oh, that's not mine.
I have mine right here.

01:02:49.641 --> 01:02:52.485
Oh, I thought the initial <i>H...</i>

01:02:53.645 --> 01:02:57.650
H for Harriet, H for Hubbard,
but it's still not mine.

01:02:57.774 --> 01:03:01.904
Mine are sensible things,
not expensive Paris frills.

01:03:02.028 --> 01:03:04.156
What good's a hankie like that
to anybody?

01:03:04.281 --> 01:03:06.830
One sneeze
and it has to go to the laundry.

01:03:08.159 --> 01:03:11.584
Mrs Hubbard, you have afforded me
a great deal of help

01:03:11.705 --> 01:03:13.799
in this difficult case.

01:03:13.915 --> 01:03:17.465
Thank you, if I may so express it,
for playing your part.

01:03:19.254 --> 01:03:21.552
If you need me again, I'll be around.

01:03:22.674 --> 01:03:24.722
Not one of Pierre's buttons is missing,

01:03:24.843 --> 01:03:27.266
and all his buttons are sewn on
with old thread.

01:03:27.387 --> 01:03:29.435
<i>As I suspected.</i>

01:03:29.556 --> 01:03:31.650
- I'm fright.
- Have no fear, mademoiselle.

01:03:31.766 --> 01:03:33.985
They all come out
looking much more peaceful.

01:03:34.102 --> 01:03:35.445
Only God can give peaceful.

01:03:35.562 --> 01:03:39.533
<i>- God dag, froken Ohlsson-
- Nej; talar ni svenska.</i>

01:03:39.649 --> 01:03:42.903
Alas, mademoiselle,
that is the extent of my Swedish.

01:03:43.028 --> 01:03:47.374
Forgive me if I am personal, but
most Scandinavians of my acquaintance

01:03:47.490 --> 01:03:50.915
are well-educated in other languages.

01:03:51.036 --> 01:03:54.336
And yet you have difficulty...

01:03:54.456 --> 01:03:57.710
I... I was born backwards.

01:03:58.710 --> 01:04:03.762
That is why I work in Africa
as missionary,

01:04:03.882 --> 01:04:08.228
teaching little brown babies
more backward than myself.

01:04:09.763 --> 01:04:14.269
But <i>I...</i> I see that you have spent
three months in America.

01:04:14.392 --> 01:04:17.020
Were you not able to improve?

01:04:18.146 --> 01:04:22.526
<i>I was in... in a mis...
I... I... international group.</i>

01:04:22.650 --> 01:04:29.033
<i>In...</i> For getting money
for African mission from American rich.

01:04:30.450 --> 01:04:35.502
<i>I...</i> I speak Swedish to big audiences

01:04:35.622 --> 01:04:41.755
<i>in... in...</i> in Swedish-American
institution in Minneapolis

01:04:41.878 --> 01:04:44.097
and other big cities.

01:04:45.256 --> 01:04:52.811
In ten weeks, we make $14,000 and...
and 27 cents.

01:04:52.931 --> 01:04:55.150
That's wonderful, wonderful.

01:04:58.228 --> 01:05:03.655
Miss Ohlsson, how long have you been
interested in religion?

01:05:03.775 --> 01:05:06.153
From five years.

01:05:08.655 --> 01:05:13.411
In summer, in...
I had been sick as always.

01:05:13.535 --> 01:05:16.835
And I sat in the grass in the garden.

01:05:16.955 --> 01:05:20.676
<i>And I... I saw Jesus in the sky...</i>

01:05:21.793 --> 01:05:29.793
medmany little children,
but all the children were brown.

01:05:30.009 --> 01:05:35.561
So it was a sign for me
to look after little brown babies.

01:05:35.682 --> 01:05:37.229
Yes.

01:05:37.350 --> 01:05:39.944
Were your parents religious?

01:05:41.062 --> 01:05:45.408
[Ne]; they had no respect for God. No.

01:05:46.359 --> 01:05:50.330
So it was not just a sign.

01:05:51.364 --> 01:05:54.743
It was also a punishment.

01:05:55.952 --> 01:05:58.580
Oh, there, there, there, there.

01:05:58.705 --> 01:06:01.128
I'm sure that God will forgive you,
Miss Ohlsson,

01:06:01.249 --> 01:06:05.800
and perhaps, which is more important,
so will your father and mother.

01:06:08.756 --> 01:06:10.099
Now...

01:06:14.804 --> 01:06:18.308
Here is the compartment
you share with...

01:06:18.433 --> 01:06:22.358
Ja, and here is my number seven bed.

01:06:22.479 --> 01:06:26.859
Yes, your number seven.
Tell me about number eight.

01:06:26.983 --> 01:06:31.580
Is filled with Miss Debenham,

01:06:31.696 --> 01:06:35.451
a very nice young lady from Baghdad,

01:06:35.575 --> 01:06:40.797
where she teach English shorthand
to children, to forward children.

01:06:42.123 --> 01:06:48.506
After the train left Vinkovci,
did she leave her berth?

01:06:48.630 --> 01:06:51.930
[Ne]; she sleep just like me.

01:06:52.050 --> 01:06:57.227
If you were fast asleep, how could
you be so sure she did not leave?

01:06:57.347 --> 01:07:02.820
In Shimoga Mission,
I can hear snake breathe.

01:07:02.936 --> 01:07:04.734
I would know.

01:07:04.854 --> 01:07:07.903
Good. And did you leave your room?

01:07:08.024 --> 01:07:12.530
[Ne]; not till morning, in my bed-gown.

01:07:12.654 --> 01:07:17.626
Is your bed-gown white with red animals?

01:07:17.742 --> 01:07:20.336
Nej; is Jaeger.

01:07:20.453 --> 01:07:23.878
And Miss Debenham's bed-gown'?

01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:28.504
<i>Den var i lila-</i>

01:07:28.628 --> 01:07:31.177
Oh, like the French "lilas", "lilac".

01:07:31.297 --> 01:07:33.220
<i>- Just lila, just lila.
- Right.</i>

01:07:35.051 --> 01:07:39.101
Good. And why are you making this trip,
Miss Ohlsson?

01:07:40.431 --> 01:07:43.731
Just <i>as</i> always, money,
money for mission.

01:07:43.851 --> 01:07:46.070
Good. Good.

01:07:46.187 --> 01:07:48.690
When this is all over, mademoiselle,

01:07:48.815 --> 01:07:52.194
I promise that I shall
make you an emolument.

01:07:52.318 --> 01:07:54.571
God will find you a reward.

01:07:57.824 --> 01:07:59.872
<i>Tack sa mycket. Tack.</i>

01:08:05.498 --> 01:08:08.126
Monsieur, she did it.

01:08:13.298 --> 01:08:16.676
Merci Pierre, and could you please
inform the Princess Dragomiroff

01:08:16.801 --> 01:08:20.600
that Signor Bianchi and I will attend
on her and her maid in her compartment?

01:08:20.721 --> 01:08:21.848
Our} monsieur.

01:08:21.973 --> 01:08:25.648
Ah! That is very proper.

01:08:28.938 --> 01:08:31.908
Monsieur <i>le</i> Comte,
this is a Hungarian diplomatic passport.

01:08:32.024 --> 01:08:35.450
It gives you and your wife
the right to refuse interrogation.

01:08:35.569 --> 01:08:37.913
In the circumstances,
we waive that right.

01:08:38.031 --> 01:08:41.581
<i>You are most kind.
As you know, Madame la Comtesse,</i>

01:08:41.701 --> 01:08:45.205
it is a joint passport which sets out
your husband's name and titles,

01:08:45.330 --> 01:08:47.832
but requires no particulars
about yourself,

01:08:47.957 --> 01:08:50.551
except your signature
and your maiden name.

01:08:50.667 --> 01:08:54.389
- Your maiden name is clearly Grunwald.
- That is correct, monsieur.

01:08:54.505 --> 01:08:58.430
My family is of German extraction,
though I now hold Hungarian citizenship.

01:08:59.801 --> 01:09:03.523
Unfortunately, the first letter
of your married signature

01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:06.814
has been almost obliterated
by a grease spot.

01:09:08.519 --> 01:09:12.649
I must say, I find immigration officials
are often less than cleanly.

01:09:12.774 --> 01:09:15.743
They sit in their box,
eating a buttered roll with one hand

01:09:15.859 --> 01:09:19.033
and stamping the spilt butter
into your passport with the other.

01:09:19.154 --> 01:09:22.408
Precisely.
Therefore, I would be greatly obliged

01:09:22.533 --> 01:09:29.337
if you could duplicate the mutilated
entry of your passport there.

01:09:33.336 --> 01:09:39.764
Elena Andrenyi née Grunwald.

01:09:49.810 --> 01:09:54.783
Allowing for the difference in pens,
the duplication seems exact.

01:09:56.359 --> 01:10:00.865
There would be little point in asking
whether this handkerchief is yours?

01:10:02.865 --> 01:10:07.086
Since it contains neither of my
initials, no point whatsoever, monsieur.

01:10:07.203 --> 01:10:11.458
And even less point in asking
the colour of your dressing gown?

01:10:11.582 --> 01:10:16.634
None, unless monsieur takes
a professional interest in apricot silk?

01:10:16.754 --> 01:10:19.678
I take a professional interest in crime,
madame.

01:10:19.799 --> 01:10:22.894
Have you and your husband
ever visited America together?

01:10:23.010 --> 01:10:26.856
No. We first met in Wiesbaden...
much later.

01:10:26.973 --> 01:10:28.190
Later than what?

01:10:28.307 --> 01:10:32.437
Later than the days of my youth,
when I was on post in Washington.

01:10:32.562 --> 01:10:34.064
You lived in Washington?

01:10:34.188 --> 01:10:38.159
Oh, what diplomat of promise has not?

01:10:38.276 --> 01:10:41.951
- You did not sleep well last night?
- On the contrary.

01:10:42.071 --> 01:10:45.245
Apart from one of Mrs Hubbard's
customary outbursts,

01:10:45.366 --> 01:10:46.868
I slept very soundly.

01:10:46.993 --> 01:10:48.370
And you, madame?

01:10:48.494 --> 01:10:53.045
Oh, even more soundly.
We neither of us woke till after eight.

01:10:53.166 --> 01:10:56.295
As is my custom on night trains,
I took Trional.

01:10:56.419 --> 01:10:58.638
Diethyl sulphone dimethyl methane.

01:10:58.755 --> 01:11:02.225
One dilutes the white crystals
with water. It is a strong hypnotic.

01:11:02.341 --> 01:11:04.935
He makes it sound like a poison.

01:11:05.052 --> 01:11:06.770
As with most sleeping draughts,

01:11:06.888 --> 01:11:10.108
if taken in sufficient quantities,
it is a poison.

01:11:10.224 --> 01:11:14.695
- You are not accusing...
- You are not accused, you are excused.

01:11:15.938 --> 01:11:19.192
Thank you both
for your help and cooperation.

01:12:00.983 --> 01:12:03.827
Why have you stopped reading?

01:12:28.010 --> 01:12:30.559
- Altezza.
- Signor Bianchi.

01:12:31.514 --> 01:12:34.267
<i>E permesso presentare
l'investigatore distinto,</i>

01:12:34.392 --> 01:12:36.235
Monsieur Hercule Poirot?

01:12:37.436 --> 01:12:41.031
Hildegarde has read me
many of your cases in the newspapers,

01:12:41.148 --> 01:12:43.651
but I have had to stop her.

01:12:43.776 --> 01:12:49.328
Nowadays, they are the only form
of literature that keeps me awake.

01:12:49.448 --> 01:12:54.875
And I need what I defiantly continue
to call my beauty sleep.

01:12:56.497 --> 01:12:59.842
- You would care for a little cognac?
- Thank you, no.

01:12:59.959 --> 01:13:01.461
Yes, please.

01:13:01.586 --> 01:13:07.218
Now, you wish me to confess
to the murder of Mr...

01:13:07.341 --> 01:13:08.809
What's his name?

01:13:08.926 --> 01:13:12.476
<i>Au contraire, Madame la Princesse,
it is I who wish to make a confession.</i>

01:13:12.597 --> 01:13:15.441
You pay me the compliment
of having read about me.

01:13:15.558 --> 01:13:21.110
I return the compliment
by admitting that I have read about you.

01:13:21.230 --> 01:13:22.607
Continue.

01:13:22.732 --> 01:13:27.579
I have been accidentally reminded that
you were the godmother of Mrs Armstrong,

01:13:27.695 --> 01:13:31.120
who was herself the mother
of the kidnapped child, Daisy.

01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:34.619
How did you become
Mrs Armstrong's godmother, madame?

01:13:34.744 --> 01:13:37.964
I was the friend and admirer
of her mother,

01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:41.129
the great American actress, Linda Arden.

01:13:41.250 --> 01:13:44.675
Why did you bring
these daggers from the place?

01:13:44.795 --> 01:13:47.969
Is that a quotation or a question?

01:13:48.090 --> 01:13:51.845
A quotation. I saw her twice
as Lady Macbeth in London.

01:13:51.969 --> 01:13:57.521
She was the greatest tragic actress
of her day.

01:13:57.642 --> 01:13:59.770
Was?
Surely she is still alive, madame?

01:13:59.894 --> 01:14:02.738
Alive, but bedridden.

01:14:04.148 --> 01:14:08.028
Did she not have a second daughter,
younger than Mrs Armstrong?

01:14:08.152 --> 01:14:10.530
There was, but I do not recall her name.

01:14:10.655 --> 01:14:13.875
When I paid a visit,
she was always away at school.

01:14:13.991 --> 01:14:16.335
What became of the younger daughter?

01:14:16.452 --> 01:14:22.550
She married a Turk or some such.
We never spoke of it.

01:14:22.667 --> 01:14:25.341
What was Mrs Armstrong's maiden name?

01:14:25.461 --> 01:14:31.844
Mrs Armstrong's maiden name
was Greenwood.

01:14:31.968 --> 01:14:35.814
May I tax your memory and, indeed,
your patience a little longer?

01:14:35.930 --> 01:14:40.060
There are other names in the Armstrong
household that I cannot recall.

01:14:40.184 --> 01:14:41.527
Was there not a secretary?

01:14:41.644 --> 01:14:43.817
<i>Of course there was a secretary.</i>

01:14:43.938 --> 01:14:45.531
Her name, Madame?

01:14:45.648 --> 01:14:49.744
Her name? Oh, my memor...

01:14:50.945 --> 01:14:54.074
She was a Miss Freebody.

01:14:54.198 --> 01:14:57.873
- Was there not a gallant chauffeur?
- <i>There</i> was.

01:14:57.994 --> 01:15:00.543
I never used him. I had my own.

01:15:00.663 --> 01:15:03.382
Surely he was not the only male servant?

01:15:03.499 --> 01:15:06.127
<i>I seem to remember
one other there.</i>

01:15:06.252 --> 01:15:11.133
He was, I think you would say,
the colonel's Indian orderly.

01:15:12.133 --> 01:15:14.807
And Mrs Armstrong's personal maid.

01:15:14.927 --> 01:15:19.398
The one who was wrongly suspected
of complicity and killed herself?

01:15:19.515 --> 01:15:22.689
I always travel
with my own personal maid.

01:15:22.810 --> 01:15:26.360
There was no need to speak
with Mrs Armstrong's.

01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:29.734
Doubtless, Fraulein Schmidt
will remember her name.

01:15:31.527 --> 01:15:34.030
Surely, Fraulein,
as one lady's maid to another,

01:15:34.155 --> 01:15:39.628
<i>- you conversed as equals below stairs.
- Ja, fa, naturlich.</i>

01:15:39.744 --> 01:15:43.089
But ladies' maids were often called
only by their Christian names.

01:15:43.205 --> 01:15:44.752
And what was hers?

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:47.047
Paulette.

01:15:47.168 --> 01:15:52.425
Hildegarde. You will be so kind
as to give me two aspirin.

01:15:52.548 --> 01:15:54.767
And you will ask
the dining-car attendant

01:15:54.884 --> 01:15:56.636
to bring me a glass of Russian tea,

01:15:56.761 --> 01:15:59.355
and then you may retire
to your own compartment.

01:15:59.472 --> 01:16:01.440
I will ring when I need you.

01:16:01.557 --> 01:16:03.400
<i>Jawohl, meine Prinzessin.</i>

01:16:08.481 --> 01:16:10.904
Finally, there was the nurse.

01:16:12.610 --> 01:16:18.288
I had no need of a nurse.

01:16:19.658 --> 01:16:22.878
That is an ordeal still to come.

01:16:25.915 --> 01:16:28.134
<i>You never smile, Madame la Princesse.</i>

01:16:28.250 --> 01:16:33.848
My doctor has advised against it.

01:16:47.186 --> 01:16:48.904
Excuse me.

01:16:55.027 --> 01:16:57.746
There is no need for us
to fatigue you further.

01:16:57.863 --> 01:17:00.537
You have been of the utmost help.

01:17:01.617 --> 01:17:04.791
Go and tell Pierre to summon
Colonel Arbuthnot in five minutes.

01:17:04.912 --> 01:17:07.006
- I want a word with the maid.
- Yes, Poirot.

01:17:09.583 --> 01:17:10.584
Fréulein Schmidt!

01:17:10.709 --> 01:17:14.179
Might I have a word with you
in the privacy of your compartment?

01:17:14.296 --> 01:17:17.470
- I have to take these aspirins...
- We will leave the door ajar.

01:17:22.847 --> 01:17:24.440
I observed how moved you were

01:17:24.557 --> 01:17:27.686
at the mention of Mrs Armstrong's maid,
Paulette.

01:17:27.810 --> 01:17:30.905
She had a sweet nature, mein Herr.
We were deep friends.

01:17:31.021 --> 01:17:33.695
Have you a photograph of her
in your possession?

01:17:33.816 --> 01:17:39.038
Ja. I never travel without my photo
box. It helps to pass the evenings.

01:17:40.322 --> 01:17:42.245
No, please, mein <i>Herr.</i> I am strong.

01:17:51.333 --> 01:17:53.051
Be calm.

01:17:54.753 --> 01:17:58.633
This could be your salvation and that
of every passenger in the Calais coach,

01:17:58.757 --> 01:18:00.304
including your mistress.

01:18:06.849 --> 01:18:09.477
When did you last open the suitcase?

01:18:09.602 --> 01:18:11.070
After Belgrade.

01:18:11.187 --> 01:18:13.315
When Pierre summoned me
to the Prinzessin,

01:18:13.439 --> 01:18:17.285
I took out a volume of Goethe, in case
she wished me to read her to sleep.

01:18:18.402 --> 01:18:20.279
Too stout for Pierre.

01:18:21.447 --> 01:18:25.372
And, yes, there is a button missing
from the tunic.

01:18:25.492 --> 01:18:28.917
A button found by Mrs Hubbard.

01:18:32.249 --> 01:18:35.970
And a passkey in the trouser pocket.

01:18:37.796 --> 01:18:39.764
<i>Here is the photo, mein Herr.</i>

01:18:44.220 --> 01:18:50.023
And this pretty, innocent girl
threw herself from a window.

01:18:51.977 --> 01:18:53.820
Use this, Fréulein.

01:18:53.938 --> 01:18:57.363
I found it and thought it must be yours,
because it bears the initial H.

01:18:57.483 --> 01:19:01.283
No, no, no. That is the handkerchief
not of a maid, but of a great lady.

01:19:01.403 --> 01:19:02.825
Like your mistress?

01:19:05.991 --> 01:19:10.337
It is her style, fa,
but not her handkerchief.

01:19:10.454 --> 01:19:12.331
I know all her linen.

01:19:13.457 --> 01:19:16.427
Besides, the initial is wrong.

01:19:16.543 --> 01:19:19.387
What is the princess's first name?

01:19:19.505 --> 01:19:22.679
Natalia, mein <i>Herr.</i>
It is a Russian name.

01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:25.428
Then I must keep it
until I find the rightful owner.

01:19:25.552 --> 01:19:29.853
Might I also keep the photograph until
this evening? I promise to return it.

01:19:29.974 --> 01:19:35.231
Ja. Ja. That does not worry me,
but this, this does.

01:19:35.354 --> 01:19:38.028
Am I to be accused
of hiding it in my suitcase?

01:19:38.148 --> 01:19:42.904
Fréulein, I am as sure
you did not hide the uniform

01:19:43.028 --> 01:19:46.828
as I am sure you are a good
and loyal friend to your mistress.

01:19:46.949 --> 01:19:49.919
Not only a good maid,
but also a good cook.

01:19:50.035 --> 01:19:54.040
Not merely a good cook, but a companion,
a comfort, a solace.

01:19:54.164 --> 01:19:57.794
You see?
You are a good cook, are you not?

01:19:57.918 --> 01:20:00.216
All my ladies have said so. <i>I...</i>

01:20:05.301 --> 01:20:06.518
<i>Auf Wiedersehen.</i>

01:20:08.929 --> 01:20:12.604
<i> Animal crackers in my soup</i>

01:20:12.725 --> 01:20:16.229
<i> Lions and tigers loop-the-loop</i>

01:20:53.515 --> 01:20:55.392
Are you opening a dress shop'?

01:21:06.028 --> 01:21:10.784
No. We are closing an inquiry.
Where is Shimoga?

01:21:10.908 --> 01:21:13.161
- I beg your pardon?
- Shimoga, where is it?

01:21:13.285 --> 01:21:16.710
It's a bit off my track.
I'm a Northwest Frontier man myself.

01:21:16.830 --> 01:21:19.629
But Shimoga's down south, in Mysore.
Why?

01:21:19.750 --> 01:21:21.172
<i>Does it possess a mission?</i>

01:21:21.293 --> 01:21:24.263
How the hell should I know?
India's pustular with missions.

01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:27.224
You are returning on leave
from India to England?

01:21:27.341 --> 01:21:30.390
- Yes.
- Why overland?

01:21:30.511 --> 01:21:31.558
Why not?

01:21:31.678 --> 01:21:34.648
Because the sea route
by P&O is more usual.

01:21:35.974 --> 01:21:38.477
I chose to come overland
for reasons of my own.

01:21:38.602 --> 01:21:40.650
Colonel Arbuthnot, in a murder inquiry,

01:21:40.771 --> 01:21:43.149
no suspect's reasons
are exclusively his own.

01:21:45.526 --> 01:21:48.871
I stopped for one night
to see Ur of the Chaldees,

01:21:48.987 --> 01:21:51.911
and for three days in Baghdad
with the AOC,

01:21:52.032 --> 01:21:53.955
who happens to be a friend of mine.

01:21:54.076 --> 01:21:58.832
The English Miss Debenham
also has travelled from Baghdad.

01:21:58.956 --> 01:22:02.335
It is possible the murder
was committed by a woman

01:22:02.459 --> 01:22:06.839
or by a man and a woman
in collaboration.

01:22:06.964 --> 01:22:10.719
From your acquaintanceship
with Miss Debenham,

01:22:10.843 --> 01:22:15.519
would you have thought that she was
capable physically or emotionally or...

01:22:15.639 --> 01:22:19.269
- That's a bloody irregular question.
- I know, but I ask it.

01:22:19.393 --> 01:22:20.861
Miss Debenham is not a woman.

01:22:25.065 --> 01:22:26.065
She's a lady.

01:22:26.150 --> 01:22:28.369
Which precludes her
from being a murderess?

01:22:28.485 --> 01:22:31.284
The man was a stranger.
She'd never seen him before.

01:22:31.405 --> 01:22:33.453
You feel warmly in the matter?

01:22:39.455 --> 01:22:41.173
I don't know what you're driving at.

01:22:41.290 --> 01:22:43.384
Then let us be practical
and drive at facts.

01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:45.844
Did you know Colonel Armstrong?

01:22:45.961 --> 01:22:48.840
<i>Not to speak to.</i>

01:22:48.964 --> 01:22:51.968
You see, his outfit and mine
wouldn't have mixed much.

01:22:52.092 --> 01:22:55.062
I'm Indian Army.
He was British Army, serving in India.

01:22:55.179 --> 01:22:58.308
- Royal Scots.
- How did you know?

01:22:58.432 --> 01:23:02.528
It was in the papers when he shot
himself after the kidnapping.

01:23:04.271 --> 01:23:05.523
Rotten show.

01:23:06.648 --> 01:23:09.117
Thought he'd have been
tougher than that.

01:23:09.234 --> 01:23:12.488
After all, he got a DSO
and an MC in France.

01:23:16.492 --> 01:23:19.166
Distinguished Service Order.

01:23:21.121 --> 01:23:22.464
Military Cross'?

01:23:22.581 --> 01:23:29.465
Mon colonel, Ratchett was
responsible for five deaths.

01:23:29.588 --> 01:23:33.468
The suicide of the falsely accused maid.

01:23:34.593 --> 01:23:37.392
The murder of the Armstrong child.

01:23:39.097 --> 01:23:41.941
The death of Mrs Armstrong,

01:23:42.059 --> 01:23:47.441
while giving premature birth
to a stillborn baby.

01:23:47.564 --> 01:23:50.238
And the ultimate suicide
of Colonel Armstrong,

01:23:50.359 --> 01:23:53.738
in the face of multiple
and intolerable bereavements!

01:23:54.863 --> 01:24:00.165
I would have understood his action
if, in addition to the DSO and MC,

01:24:00.285 --> 01:24:02.708
he had been awarded the VC.

01:24:02.829 --> 01:24:05.673
Which stands, as you may know,
for Victoria <i>Cross</i>

01:24:05.791 --> 01:24:07.509
and is awarded for valour.

01:24:09.294 --> 01:24:13.674
Then, in my opinion,
Ratchett deserved what he got.

01:24:14.841 --> 01:24:18.095
Though I'd sooner have seen him
properly tried by jury.

01:24:18.220 --> 01:24:22.896
Trial by 12 good men and true
is a sound system.

01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:32.326
We believe the murder was committed
at 1:15.

01:24:32.442 --> 01:24:34.035
What were you doing then?

01:24:35.070 --> 01:24:37.664
I was yarning with young
what's-his-name, McQueen,

01:24:37.781 --> 01:24:39.283
in his compartment.

01:24:39.408 --> 01:24:43.163
He was interested in the future
of India. A bit impractical.

01:24:43.287 --> 01:24:45.915
He thought the British ought
to move out.

01:24:46.039 --> 01:24:49.259
How long did you stay yarning
after that?

01:24:49.376 --> 01:24:52.129
Till 1:30.

01:24:52.254 --> 01:24:56.555
It's what I call a three-pipe yarn.

01:24:56.675 --> 01:25:01.272
Colonel Arbuthnot, you are
the only passenger in the Calais coach

01:25:01.388 --> 01:25:03.482
<i>who smokes a pipe.</i>

01:25:05.559 --> 01:25:11.566
- So it would appear.
- Then this must be your pipe cleaner.

01:25:13.567 --> 01:25:14.568
It's the same brand.

01:25:14.693 --> 01:25:17.367
It was found in an ashtray
by the dead man's bedside.

01:25:17.487 --> 01:25:22.459
Then someone planted it there.
It's a used "peep" cleaner.

01:25:23.785 --> 01:25:25.879
Or are you suggesting
that I'm fool enough

01:25:25.996 --> 01:25:29.546
to have entered Ratchett's cabin,
murdered him, cleaned my "peep"

01:25:29.666 --> 01:25:31.885
and dropped it in the ashtray
before leaving?

01:25:32.002 --> 01:25:34.175
No, Colonel Arbuthnot.

01:25:35.839 --> 01:25:37.512
Miss Debenham!

01:25:39.092 --> 01:25:43.097
- <i>Er...</i> can I stay?
- No, Colonel Arbuthnot.

01:25:48.894 --> 01:25:50.362
Please be seated.

01:25:54.941 --> 01:25:57.035
Forgive me, Miss Debenham.
I must be brief.

01:25:57.152 --> 01:26:00.656
You met Colonel Arbuthnot and fell
in love with each other in Baghdad.

01:26:00.781 --> 01:26:04.411
Why must the English conceal
even their most impeccable emotions?

01:26:05.577 --> 01:26:13.007
To answer your observations in order,
of course, yes, yes and I don't know.

01:26:13.126 --> 01:26:16.471
Then let me tell you what you do know.
That on the Bosphorus Ferryboat

01:26:16.588 --> 01:26:19.341
I overheard part
of your conversation with the colonel.

01:26:19.466 --> 01:26:23.767
Not now, not now. When it's all over.
When it's behind us. Then.

01:26:24.721 --> 01:26:27.770
When what was all over, Miss Debenham?

01:26:28.850 --> 01:26:34.698
And when what was behind you? Was it
some task that had to be performed?

01:26:35.691 --> 01:26:40.071
Some ordeal to be endured'? Some
dark deed that had to be dispatched?

01:26:40.195 --> 01:26:43.665
Mr Poirot, I'm not at liberty
to answer any of those questions.

01:26:43.782 --> 01:26:45.580
Not here on this train, perhaps.

01:26:45.701 --> 01:26:49.331
But when the Yugoslav police take over
an unsolved murder case at Brod,

01:26:49.454 --> 01:26:52.298
you will not remain at liberty
unless you answer.

01:26:52.416 --> 01:26:54.714
I can always call my lawyers
long-distance.

01:26:54.835 --> 01:26:57.634
This is a private matter
between the colonel and myself.

01:26:57.754 --> 01:27:00.348
Miss Debenham, in a murder case,
no matter is private

01:27:00.465 --> 01:27:02.593
and evasion breeds suspicion.

01:27:02.718 --> 01:27:06.018
When what was all over? When what was
behind you? Please answer!

01:27:06.138 --> 01:27:08.891
You will remain here
until I get an answer from you.

01:27:09.015 --> 01:27:12.235
Colonel, please, Monsieur Poirot
has expressly forbidden...

01:27:12.352 --> 01:27:15.697
Poirot has no right. He's out of order.
This is a private matter.

01:27:15.814 --> 01:27:19.364
<i>- Je vous en prie, mon colonel.
- Out of my way.</i>

01:27:19.484 --> 01:27:22.112
When what was all over?
Answer my question.

01:27:22.237 --> 01:27:23.910
Get your hands off Miss Debenham.

01:27:24.030 --> 01:27:26.954
I was not aware that I was
keeping my hands on Miss Debenham.

01:27:27.075 --> 01:27:30.249
- I asked her a simple question...
- So I heard.

01:27:30.370 --> 01:27:34.671
Then perhaps you can answer it for her.

01:27:42.841 --> 01:27:46.641
Can you give me your solemn oath,
as a foreigner...

01:27:48.930 --> 01:27:51.979
that if the answer has nothing to do
with the murder,

01:27:52.100 --> 01:27:54.228
you'll treat it confidentially?

01:27:54.352 --> 01:27:55.604
I will.

01:28:04.571 --> 01:28:09.793
Six months ago, before I'd even met
Miss Debenham, my memsahib...

01:28:09.910 --> 01:28:11.537
<i>Come?</i>

01:28:11.661 --> 01:28:16.292
My wife expressed herself bored,
not only at living in India,

01:28:16.416 --> 01:28:19.511
but at living with me.

01:28:19.628 --> 01:28:22.381
And asked me to provide her
with a divorce.

01:28:23.381 --> 01:28:26.931
In view of my position, commanding
officer, 12th Gurkhas, I refused.

01:28:28.178 --> 01:28:30.601
Well, had I not,
I should have lost my command.

01:28:32.015 --> 01:28:35.986
My wife returned to England,
where there is irrefutable evidence

01:28:36.102 --> 01:28:40.608
that she has been
persistently unfaithful to me.

01:28:42.192 --> 01:28:45.446
I have therefore instituted
divorce proceedings

01:28:45.570 --> 01:28:48.540
in which she is cited
as the guilty party.

01:28:49.991 --> 01:28:54.041
And when those proceedings
are behind us,

01:28:54.162 --> 01:28:56.585
when those proceedings are all over...

01:28:58.333 --> 01:29:00.461
I propose to marry
Miss Debenham.

01:29:02.170 --> 01:29:09.520
Meanwhile, it is of vital importance,
under English law, that our...

01:29:10.679 --> 01:29:12.022
behaviour...

01:29:12.973 --> 01:29:18.104
should not provide evidence
for counter-proceedings by my wife.

01:29:23.775 --> 01:29:25.777
Does that answer your question?

01:29:37.873 --> 01:29:39.341
Well...

01:29:42.377 --> 01:29:44.630
it is certainly an answer.

01:29:46.590 --> 01:29:49.469
Doctor, is Pierre
sufficiently recovered?

01:29:49.593 --> 01:29:51.516
- Fully.
- May we go?

01:29:51.636 --> 01:29:56.733
You may, with my assurance that
our foreigners' lips shall be sealed.

01:29:56.850 --> 01:29:59.820
Sorry if I hurt the lad. Provocation.

01:30:02.564 --> 01:30:06.194
They could have done it together. She
has hidden fire. She is very strong.

01:30:06.318 --> 01:30:08.696
Why did you not ask her
if she had been to America?

01:30:08.820 --> 01:30:10.743
Because I did not need to.

01:30:13.283 --> 01:30:16.412
<i>Pierre, le colonel s 'excuse
de son geste.</i>

01:30:16.536 --> 01:30:20.416
- Merci monsieur.
- Signor Foscarelli!

01:30:24.002 --> 01:30:26.300
You are a naturalised American subject?

01:30:26.421 --> 01:30:27.673
- You bet.
- For how long?

01:30:27.797 --> 01:30:30.641
<i>Seven years.</i>

01:30:34.179 --> 01:30:37.274
Otherwise, he will detain you longer
than you would detain him.

01:30:37.390 --> 01:30:39.609
- You are a motorcar salesman.
- You bet.

01:30:39.726 --> 01:30:44.232
- American automobiles to Italians.
- Did you know Cassetti?

01:30:44.356 --> 01:30:46.859
<i>Not on your sweet life. Era Mafioso.</i>

01:30:48.234 --> 01:30:50.032
He says he was Mafia.

01:30:50.153 --> 01:30:52.121
- Really?
- Yes.

01:30:52.238 --> 01:30:54.957
Who do you...
who do you think killed him?

01:30:55.075 --> 01:30:58.204
- Er... <i>un</i> altro Mafioso.
- He says another Mafia.

01:30:58.328 --> 01:31:01.332
They are always killing each other
with a knife or with a gun.

01:31:17.013 --> 01:31:19.812
Why did you bring this dagger
from the place?

01:31:19.933 --> 01:31:21.651
Because I found it in my make-up bag.

01:31:21.768 --> 01:31:25.898
<i>Ecco,</i> what did I say? Knives or guns.
It's a vendetta between two Mafiosi.

01:31:26.022 --> 01:31:27.444
Give me the dagger.

01:31:34.406 --> 01:31:36.750
When did you last
open your make-up bag?

01:31:36.866 --> 01:31:38.960
Yesterday evening.
I took everything out.

01:31:39.077 --> 01:31:41.830
If you took everything out,
why did you need to reopen it?

01:31:41.955 --> 01:31:44.128
Because I was putting something back in.

01:31:45.542 --> 01:31:48.887
You may set your mind at rest,
Mrs Hubbard.

01:31:50.422 --> 01:31:51.469
The missing button.

01:31:51.589 --> 01:31:54.183
Precisely, and I can assure you
the owner of the tunic

01:31:54.300 --> 01:31:55.893
is not now on the train.

01:31:57.721 --> 01:31:59.519
Are you going back to the dining car?

01:31:59.639 --> 01:32:03.564
I'll say I am. Do you think I could face
my compartment so soon after that?

01:32:03.685 --> 01:32:08.156
Would you kindly ask the chief attendant
to arrange the tables and chairs

01:32:08.273 --> 01:32:12.028
so that Signor Bianchi,
Dr Constantine and myself

01:32:12.152 --> 01:32:15.247
can confront the passengers
with the solution of the murder?

01:32:26.041 --> 01:32:28.339
I... I help with the risoluzione?

01:32:28.460 --> 01:32:31.760
Yes, if you will briefly answer
two more questions.

01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:33.223
Shoot.

01:32:33.339 --> 01:32:37.515
On the night of the murder,
did Mr Beddoes leave the compartment?

01:32:37.635 --> 01:32:41.515
No. No, he grunt like a pig
with the pain in his teeth.

01:32:41.639 --> 01:32:45.564
And have you ever been
in private service?

01:32:45.685 --> 01:32:46.732
No.

01:32:47.687 --> 01:32:49.064
Thank you. That is all.

01:32:49.189 --> 01:32:51.032
<i>- Scusi.
- Si.</i>

01:32:53.735 --> 01:32:57.285
- <i>Enfin,</i> doctor?
- This blood is human.

01:32:57.405 --> 01:33:03.083
This dagger could, in two different
hands, have inflicted all of the wounds.

01:33:03.203 --> 01:33:05.456
And you know who inflicted them, huh?

01:33:05.580 --> 01:33:09.084
Our last interrogation will be
something of a gamble.

01:33:10.794 --> 01:33:12.888
But if it succeeds...

01:33:14.214 --> 01:33:15.591
we'll know.

01:33:19.177 --> 01:33:22.522
Ah, come in, come in.
Please be seated.

01:33:24.057 --> 01:33:28.904
You are Cyrus B Hardman,
a theatrical agent.

01:33:29.020 --> 01:33:33.526
No. I mean, I'm...
I'm not a theatrical agent.

01:33:34.484 --> 01:33:37.784
That's a phoney, issued to me
under license by Pinkertons.

01:33:37.904 --> 01:33:40.748
- Ah, the detective agency?
- Stamboul branch.

01:33:40.865 --> 01:33:44.586
Ratchett asked them
for an American bodyguard. They sent me.

01:33:44.702 --> 01:33:46.955
<i>I... didn't do so hot.</i>

01:33:49.124 --> 01:33:51.843
Can you prove this was
the reason for yourjourney?

01:34:16.109 --> 01:34:18.737
<i>It's Paulette.
Paulette.</i>

01:34:21.531 --> 01:34:22.953
Paulette Michel.

01:34:27.162 --> 01:34:29.460
Now I can stop pretending
to be anything.

01:35:10.246 --> 01:35:14.251
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention, please?

01:35:14.375 --> 01:35:17.470
May I respectfully suggest
that there should be no talking

01:35:17.587 --> 01:35:19.430
while Monsieur Poirot addresses you.

01:35:19.547 --> 01:35:24.599
If anyone wishes to make a statement, he
or she can do so at the meeting's end.

01:35:24.719 --> 01:35:26.016
Thank you.

01:35:28.932 --> 01:35:32.687
Ladies and gentlemen, you are
all aware that a repulsive murderer

01:35:32.810 --> 01:35:37.031
has himself been repulsively
and perhaps deservedly murdered.

01:35:37.148 --> 01:35:40.823
How and why? Here is the simple answer.

01:35:40.944 --> 01:35:42.946
There is evidence supporting the theory

01:35:43.071 --> 01:35:45.369
that the murderer was
a stranger to us all.

01:35:45.490 --> 01:35:50.838
Mrs Hubbard was conscious of a man
in her compartment soon after 1:15am.

01:35:50.954 --> 01:35:56.586
She later found near her bedside
the button of a wagon-lit conductor.

01:35:56.709 --> 01:36:00.759
Fréulein Schmidt discovered,
planted in her suitcase,

01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:05.727
the uniform of a conductor, which could
not possibly have fitted Pierre,

01:36:05.843 --> 01:36:09.017
and from which, in fact,
there was a button missing.

01:36:09.138 --> 01:36:15.271
And in the trouser pocket of the uniform
was a conductor's passkey.

01:36:15.395 --> 01:36:20.868
Later still, Mrs Hubbard discovered
this bloodstained dagger,

01:36:20.984 --> 01:36:25.785
which Dr Constantine confirms
could have been the murderer's weapon.

01:36:26.948 --> 01:36:31.499
The obvious implication
is that the murderer,

01:36:31.619 --> 01:36:35.044
disguised as a conductor,
boarded the train at Belgrade,

01:36:35.164 --> 01:36:39.294
made his way by means of the convenient
passkey to Ratchett's compartment,

01:36:39.419 --> 01:36:43.344
stabbed him to death,
planted the dagger and the uniform,

01:36:43.464 --> 01:36:48.095
and then departed, since the train
was now halted in a snowdrift.

01:36:48.219 --> 01:36:52.975
Who was he? I am inclined
to agree with Mr Foscarelli,

01:36:53.099 --> 01:36:55.978
who believes that he was
a rival member of the Mafia,

01:36:56.102 --> 01:36:58.400
exacting private vengeance
for a vendetta

01:36:58.521 --> 01:37:03.197
whose precise nature the Yugoslav police
will undoubtedly identify.

01:37:05.820 --> 01:37:08.118
But... is that all?

01:37:08.239 --> 01:37:12.619
No. No, no, no, no. No, it is not.

01:37:12.744 --> 01:37:16.465
I said, here is the simple answer.

01:37:19.375 --> 01:37:24.176
There is also a more... complex one.

01:37:27.008 --> 01:37:33.391
But remember my first solution when I...
when you've heard my second.

01:37:34.932 --> 01:37:37.936
Let us, for the moment,
assume what is perfectly plausible,

01:37:38.061 --> 01:37:40.735
that the mysterious stranger
did not exist.

01:37:41.689 --> 01:37:43.691
The murder must then
have been committed

01:37:43.816 --> 01:37:47.662
by some person or persons
in the Calais coach

01:37:47.779 --> 01:37:51.659
and therefore are now present
in this dining car.

01:37:52.658 --> 01:37:55.707
Let us not, for the moment,
ask the question “how",

01:37:55.828 --> 01:37:59.173
but the question "why",
which will tell us how.

01:38:00.708 --> 01:38:03.052
I was not surprised
that every single one of you

01:38:03.169 --> 01:38:06.343
should have heard
of the notorious Armstrong case.

01:38:06.464 --> 01:38:11.436
But I confess to a mild surprise
when the first passenger I interrogated,

01:38:11.552 --> 01:38:16.353
Mr McQueen, admitted,
under emotional stress,

01:38:16.474 --> 01:38:20.775
that he had actually known
Mrs Armstrong, albeit very slightly.

01:38:20.895 --> 01:38:23.364
She was gentle and frightened.

01:38:23.481 --> 01:38:25.529
But not too frightened
to take an interest

01:38:25.650 --> 01:38:27.778
in a young man who wanted
to go on the stage.

01:38:27.902 --> 01:38:29.950
Was Mr McQueen lying

01:38:30.071 --> 01:38:34.451
when he denied ever having known
that Ratchett was Cassetti?

01:38:34.575 --> 01:38:38.500
Or did he become Ratchett's secretary
as part of a deliberate plan

01:38:38.621 --> 01:38:41.215
to avenge Mrs Armstrong's death?

01:38:42.458 --> 01:38:44.586
Only by interrogating
the other passengers

01:38:44.710 --> 01:38:46.178
could I hope to see the light.

01:38:46.295 --> 01:38:48.673
But when I began to question them,

01:38:48.798 --> 01:38:54.100
the light, <i>as</i> Macbeth would have said,
thickened.

01:38:55.096 --> 01:38:56.894
When I told the Princess Dragomiroff

01:38:57.014 --> 01:39:00.234
that I knew she was
Mrs Armstrong's godmother,

01:39:00.351 --> 01:39:02.524
her answers to my subsequent questions

01:39:02.645 --> 01:39:06.616
smelled strongly
of inaccuracy and evasion.

01:39:06.732 --> 01:39:11.238
Even I knew more from reading
the newspaper reports

01:39:11.362 --> 01:39:15.287
than she from her frequent visits.

01:39:16.242 --> 01:39:17.494
Was there not a chauffeur?

01:39:17.618 --> 01:39:22.089
There was, monsieur, but I had my own.
I never used him.

01:39:22.206 --> 01:39:23.206
Evasion.

01:39:23.291 --> 01:39:26.170
What was the name
of Mrs Armstrong's personal maid?

01:39:26.294 --> 01:39:30.800
I always travel with my own maid,
monsieur.

01:39:30.923 --> 01:39:34.803
There was no need to speak
with Mrs Armstrong's.

01:39:34.927 --> 01:39:38.477
Evasion! I asked for particulars
of the manservant.

01:39:38.598 --> 01:39:43.775
He was, I think, the colonel's Indian,
how you would say, orderly.

01:39:43.895 --> 01:39:45.488
Inaccuracy.

01:39:45.605 --> 01:39:48.734
Colonel Armstrong was an officer
of the British Army in India.

01:39:48.858 --> 01:39:54.206
He would have had a British batman,
like, er, like Private Beddoes, huh,

01:39:54.322 --> 01:39:56.541
to serve his personal needs.

01:39:56.657 --> 01:39:59.536
Only officers of the Indian Army,
like Colonel Arbuthnot,

01:39:59.660 --> 01:40:00.786
have Indian orderlies.

01:40:00.912 --> 01:40:04.257
I asked her the name
of Mrs Armstrong's younger sister.

01:40:04.373 --> 01:40:05.920
I do not recall her name.

01:40:06.042 --> 01:40:11.799
Unbelievable evasion. I asked her
the name of Mrs Armstrong's secretary.

01:40:11.923 --> 01:40:14.551
Yes, a Miss Freebody.

01:40:14.675 --> 01:40:17.019
<i>Non, c'est impossible ca.</i>

01:40:18.095 --> 01:40:23.943
The princess, it seems, is playing the
psychological game of word association.

01:40:24.060 --> 01:40:27.314
Freebody is the name
of the junior partner

01:40:27.438 --> 01:40:31.318
of one of London's most famous
and most opulent ladies' stores

01:40:31.442 --> 01:40:35.197
of the sort perhaps patronised
by the princess herself.

01:40:35.321 --> 01:40:39.246
The name of the senior partner
is Debenham.

01:40:40.284 --> 01:40:42.082
Debenham and Freebody.

01:40:43.746 --> 01:40:46.750
Was the princess covering up
for our Miss Debenham,

01:40:46.874 --> 01:40:49.969
who taught shorthand in Baghdad?

01:40:51.295 --> 01:40:56.051
Can she tell us the name
of Mrs Armstrong's younger sister?

01:40:56.175 --> 01:41:00.601
Then I will tell you her Christian
and her maiden name.

01:41:00.721 --> 01:41:04.316
When I asked the Princess Dragomiroff
if she could tell me

01:41:04.433 --> 01:41:08.563
the maiden name of her goddaughter,
Mrs Armstrong,

01:41:08.688 --> 01:41:12.864
she could not possibly, <i>as</i> a godmother,
plead ignorance of this. She replied...

01:41:12.984 --> 01:41:15.282
Greenwood.

01:41:15.403 --> 01:41:20.204
Grunwald is
the German for Greenwood.

01:41:21.784 --> 01:41:24.754
<i>The princess's hesitation persuades me</i>

01:41:24.870 --> 01:41:29.967
that Grunwald was the true maiden name
of her goddaughter, Mrs Armstrong,

01:41:30.084 --> 01:41:36.433
and that the Countess Andrenyi is Mrs
Armstrong's surviving younger sister.

01:41:41.345 --> 01:41:46.226
Her Christian name is Helena.
Not Elena. No, no, no.

01:41:46.350 --> 01:41:47.818
But Helena.

01:41:48.769 --> 01:41:52.945
And where did she lose
her Christian name's initial H?

01:41:53.065 --> 01:41:59.493
She lost it under a convenient
grease spot in her husband's passport.

01:41:59.614 --> 01:42:02.993
And why was the grease spot
purposely applied?

01:42:03.117 --> 01:42:08.374
Because she and her husband were afraid
that this handkerchief,

01:42:08.497 --> 01:42:14.220
bearing the initial H, might lead me to
suspect her of complicity in the murder.

01:42:14.337 --> 01:42:17.261
I swear before God and on my word
of honour as a gentleman,

01:42:17.381 --> 01:42:19.475
that this does not belong to my wife.

01:42:19.592 --> 01:42:24.223
No, no, no, no, no, no. Not at...
No. No. No. It does not.

01:42:25.306 --> 01:42:29.027
No. Nor does it belong
to Mrs Harriet Belinda Hubbard.

01:42:29.143 --> 01:42:36.777
Nor to Fréulein Hildegarde Schmidt,
whose finest quality is her loyalty.

01:42:36.901 --> 01:42:41.372
- The initial is wrong.
- What is the princess's first name?

01:42:41.489 --> 01:42:45.119
Natalia, mein <i>Herr.</i>
It is a Russian name.

01:42:46.077 --> 01:42:48.171
In the Russian, or Cyrillic, alphabet,

01:42:48.287 --> 01:42:55.921
their capital N is written
like our capital H.

01:42:56.045 --> 01:43:00.972
Madame la Princess's, should this costly
handkerchief cease to remain an exhibit,

01:43:01.092 --> 01:43:04.221
it will be returned
to your loyal maid for laundering.

01:43:04.345 --> 01:43:07.440
Or is Hildegarde Schmidt
really your maid?

01:43:07.556 --> 01:43:12.813
I have, perhaps, a nose for the aura
of fine food and laid a trap.

01:43:12.937 --> 01:43:18.944
- You are a good cook, are you not?
- All my ladies have said so. I...

01:43:19.068 --> 01:43:21.446
If you are a lady's maid,

01:43:21.570 --> 01:43:25.200
your ladies never have a chance
of discovering if you are a good cook.

01:43:25.324 --> 01:43:27.873
As good a cook as Hildegarde Schmidt
must have been

01:43:27.993 --> 01:43:30.416
to the Armstrong household.

01:43:32.540 --> 01:43:33.962
<i>Enfin.</i>

01:43:35.251 --> 01:43:41.600
Who do we now have here in this car
that could have known

01:43:41.716 --> 01:43:47.519
or could have been involved
with the Armstrong household?

01:43:48.723 --> 01:43:50.646
We have, one, Mr McQueen,

01:43:50.766 --> 01:43:55.818
who became boyishly devoted to Mrs
Armstrong at the time of the kidnapping.

01:43:55.938 --> 01:44:00.034
Two, the Princess Dragomiroff, who was
Mrs Armstrong's devoted godmother.

01:44:00.151 --> 01:44:04.497
Three, the Countess Andrenyi, who was
Mrs Armstrong's devoted younger sister.

01:44:04.613 --> 01:44:07.617
Four, the Count Andrenyi, who is
Helena's devoted husband

01:44:07.742 --> 01:44:10.962
and Mrs Armstrong's
devoted brother-in-law.

01:44:11.078 --> 01:44:15.333
Five, Hildegarde Schmidt,
who was Mrs Armstrong's devoted cook.

01:44:15.458 --> 01:44:19.634
Six, Mary Debenham, who was
Mrs Armstrong's devoted secretary.

01:44:19.754 --> 01:44:22.132
Miss Debenham's inclusion
is pure conjecture.

01:44:22.256 --> 01:44:27.433
I did not have to ask Miss Debenham
if she had ever lived in America,

01:44:27.553 --> 01:44:30.523
because during her interrogation,
she said...

01:44:30.639 --> 01:44:32.767
I can call my lawyers long-distance.

01:44:34.268 --> 01:44:38.364
An Englishwoman who had never lived
in America would have said,

01:44:38.481 --> 01:44:43.112
"I can always make a trunk call
to my solicitors."

01:44:46.572 --> 01:44:51.169
<i>Tout de méme, I must thank
the pipe-smoking Colonel Arbuthnot</i>

01:44:51.285 --> 01:44:56.212
for a remark which finally resolved
all my confusions about this...

01:44:56.332 --> 01:44:58.960
this extraordinary case.

01:44:59.084 --> 01:45:02.054
I prefer to set aside the fact

01:45:02.171 --> 01:45:06.722
that he denied ever having spoken
to Colonel Armstrong in India.

01:45:06.842 --> 01:45:09.891
And yet he remembered in great detail

01:45:10.012 --> 01:45:15.439
the decorations which Colonel Armstrong
had won years earlier in France.

01:45:17.186 --> 01:45:21.316
I prefer to remember his views
on the British jury system.

01:45:21.440 --> 01:45:25.411
Trial by 12 good men and true
is a sound system.

01:45:28.113 --> 01:45:34.416
The iron tongue of midnight
hath told.

01:45:34.537 --> 01:45:35.754
Twelve.

01:45:36.872 --> 01:45:44.051
Suddenly, the number 12 began to ring
in my head like a great bell.

01:45:45.422 --> 01:45:46.924
Twelve.

01:45:47.049 --> 01:45:49.768
Doctor, how many wounds were there
in Ratchett's body?

01:45:49.885 --> 01:45:50.977
Twelve.

01:45:51.095 --> 01:45:55.271
Mr McQueen, how many capital letters,
each inscribed by a different hand,

01:45:55.391 --> 01:45:58.065
were contained in each
of the two threatening messages

01:45:58.185 --> 01:46:00.654
you showed me
in Ratchett's correspondence file?

01:46:00.771 --> 01:46:03.445
Er... er... 12. 12.

01:46:03.566 --> 01:46:06.445
Colonel Arbuthnot,
how many persons in a jury?

01:46:06.569 --> 01:46:08.367
Twelve.

01:46:10.906 --> 01:46:14.501
Pierre Paul Michel,
how many passengers in the Calais coach,

01:46:14.618 --> 01:46:17.713
excluding myself and the murdered man?

01:46:17.830 --> 01:46:19.173
Twelve, monsieur.

01:46:21.208 --> 01:46:22.505
- Show me your wallet.
- No!

01:46:22.626 --> 01:46:25.721
<i>Votre portefeuille.
Mr Hardman, you may not speak.</i>

01:46:27.798 --> 01:46:31.348
Ratchett never asked you
to be his bodyguard, he asked me.

01:46:31.468 --> 01:46:35.268
And I, perhaps to my discredit, refused.

01:46:37.975 --> 01:46:40.728
Before you joined Pinkertons
as a private detective,

01:46:40.853 --> 01:46:44.107
you were an ordinary policeman,
were you not?

01:46:46.400 --> 01:46:48.073
A cop...

01:46:49.486 --> 01:46:52.706
who, <i>as</i> is customary with cops,

01:46:52.823 --> 01:46:59.798
fell in love with a pretty housemaid
on his beat.

01:47:02.499 --> 01:47:06.970
Yes, and would have married her, if...

01:47:13.594 --> 01:47:18.020
Your daughter, Paulette,
never died of scarlet fever, did she?

01:47:19.224 --> 01:47:23.274
No, she killed herself
when falsely accused

01:47:23.395 --> 01:47:31.371
of complicity in the kidnapping
and killing of little Daisy Armstrong.

01:47:44.667 --> 01:47:46.044
<i>They...</i>

01:47:48.045 --> 01:47:52.596
They could not have done it
without you, could they?

01:47:52.716 --> 01:47:54.468
You.

01:47:54.593 --> 01:48:00.771
The procurer of this disguise
for the mysterious member of the Mafia,

01:48:00.891 --> 01:48:05.192
who never existed any more
than the owner of this kimono existed

01:48:05.312 --> 01:48:08.691
as a real character and not <i>as</i>
a red herring to confuse and deceive me.

01:48:08.816 --> 01:48:12.696
Although I think
that I was not deceived.

01:48:13.988 --> 01:48:19.245
I have, how shall I put it,
an eye for the...

01:48:19.368 --> 01:48:21.917
for the figure of a receding woman.

01:48:22.037 --> 01:48:27.919
Countess, your cosmopolitan accent
showed an inherited ability...

01:48:29.003 --> 01:48:31.381
from your actress mother.

01:48:34.008 --> 01:48:41.062
But God knows from what
implausible source Miss Greta Ohlsson...

01:48:42.016 --> 01:48:47.147
learned her English vocabulary,
too ludicrous to be credited.

01:48:49.440 --> 01:48:51.909
I was born backwards.

01:48:52.026 --> 01:48:55.576
That is why I work
in Africa as missionary,

01:48:55.696 --> 01:48:59.291
teaching little brown babies
more backwards than myself.

01:48:59.408 --> 01:49:02.378
You coined words like "bed-gown",

01:49:02.494 --> 01:49:05.919
and yet you understand
words like "emolument“.

01:49:06.915 --> 01:49:09.634
I truly believe you did look after
little brown babies

01:49:09.752 --> 01:49:12.972
<i>at your mission in Shimoga,
which is in India, by the way, you know.</i>

01:49:13.088 --> 01:49:15.182
It's not Africa.

01:49:15.299 --> 01:49:18.348
But I believe you were covering up
for once, years earlier,

01:49:18.469 --> 01:49:19.812
when you were in America,

01:49:19.928 --> 01:49:23.148
having looked after a little white baby
called Daisy,

01:49:23.265 --> 01:49:26.109
whose death, though you could
do nothing to prevent it,

01:49:26.226 --> 01:49:30.106
so preyed on your mind that you sought
refuge in a vision of Jesus.

01:49:30.230 --> 01:49:34.986
And your future <i>as</i> a missionary, looking
after little brown babies, was sealed.

01:49:36.111 --> 01:49:43.996
You. You were lucky only to be bound and
gagged, not crushed like the manservant.

01:49:44.119 --> 01:49:45.792
- Mr Beddoes.
- Sir.

01:49:45.913 --> 01:49:48.712
You served with the British Army
in Scotland.

01:49:48.832 --> 01:49:50.926
Colonel Armstrong
was in the Royal Scots.

01:49:51.043 --> 01:49:54.593
Would you kindly give Dr Constantine
your deepest butler's bow?

01:49:58.092 --> 01:49:59.969
Yes, there is an old contusion.

01:50:00.094 --> 01:50:03.314
The result of a slight fracas
in the mess, sir,

01:50:03.430 --> 01:50:07.606
with regard to the quality
of a pudding known <i>as</i> spotted dick.

01:50:07.726 --> 01:50:11.105
Thank you,
but I think you've been spotted too.

01:50:12.314 --> 01:50:16.285
Mr Foscarelli is very knowledgeable
about automobiles.

01:50:16.401 --> 01:50:21.202
I suspected that perhaps he had
once been the Armstrongs' chauffeur.

01:50:21.323 --> 01:50:23.451
I asked if he had been
in private service.

01:50:23.575 --> 01:50:24.952
No.

01:50:25.077 --> 01:50:27.796
I think Mr Foscarelli's
appalling English

01:50:27.913 --> 01:50:30.883
is more genuine than Miss Ohlsson's,
but I think he meant yes.

01:50:30.999 --> 01:50:33.172
- Think, monsieur?
- Think, yes, think!

01:50:33.293 --> 01:50:36.797
What else can be done on a train
isolated by a snowdrift?

01:50:36.922 --> 01:50:39.516
If all these people are not implicated
in the crime,

01:50:39.633 --> 01:50:42.557
then why have they all told me,
under interrogation,

01:50:42.678 --> 01:50:44.555
stupid and often unnecessary lies'?

01:50:44.680 --> 01:50:45.772
Why? Why? Why? Why?

01:50:45.889 --> 01:50:49.860
Doubtless because they
did not expect you to be <i>on</i> the train.

01:50:49.977 --> 01:50:52.730
They had no time to concert
their cover story.

01:50:53.897 --> 01:50:58.118
I was hoping someone other than myself
would say that.

01:51:00.779 --> 01:51:02.656
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:51:02.781 --> 01:51:08.834
we now come to my own reconstruction
of the night of the murder.

01:51:09.830 --> 01:51:16.008
Or, <i>er...</i> the night of the red herrings.

01:51:18.380 --> 01:51:21.384
<i>I... I only wish...</i>

01:51:30.309 --> 01:51:34.030
I only wish I could describe it
with the...

01:51:36.064 --> 01:51:43.448
incomparable panache, the consummate
verve, the enthralling cadences,

01:51:43.572 --> 01:51:46.792
the delicate gestures,
the evocative expressions

01:51:46.909 --> 01:51:50.288
of America's greatest tragic actress,
Harriet Belinda.

01:51:50.412 --> 01:51:53.916
Miss Linda Arden.

01:51:55.584 --> 01:51:59.464
I've heard she wanted to play comedy
parts, but her husband wouldn't have it.

01:51:59.588 --> 01:52:03.934
Which husband?
Your second husband, Mr Hubbard?

01:52:04.051 --> 01:52:07.976
Or your first husband, Mr Grunwald?

01:52:09.056 --> 01:52:13.027
Linda Arden, the actress,
never played as difficult a role

01:52:13.143 --> 01:52:18.491
as Mrs Hubbard, the organiser
of this extraordinary revenge.

01:52:20.943 --> 01:52:26.120
Dare I deduce that the great Linda Arden
has been cured of her incurable disease

01:52:26.240 --> 01:52:27.958
and is no longer bedridden'?

01:52:29.910 --> 01:52:33.005
It is I who should be committed
to a bed in a mental home.

01:52:33.121 --> 01:52:36.091
It is I who need a cure
for being so slow

01:52:36.208 --> 01:52:38.677
to notice the tricks
that were being played on me

01:52:38.794 --> 01:52:41.217
with regard to the time of the murder.

01:52:45.676 --> 01:52:48.646
- Will there be anything more, sir?
- There will.

01:52:53.308 --> 01:52:56.482
Tell Mr McQueen I want to see him, now.

01:52:56.603 --> 01:52:58.321
Very good, sir.

01:52:58.438 --> 01:53:01.408
<i>"And six beakers, stop."</i>

01:53:01.525 --> 01:53:04.950
"Only five, repeat,
five beakers were delivered."

01:53:05.070 --> 01:53:08.199
"One, repeat, one badly chipped,

01:53:08.323 --> 01:53:13.124
which will be returned on receipt
of replacement to my Paris address."

01:53:13.245 --> 01:53:15.498
"Signed, Ratchett."

01:53:18.125 --> 01:53:20.423
OK, Hector, that's all.

01:53:25.173 --> 01:53:27.926
- Goodnight, Mr Ratchett.
- Goodnight, Hector.

01:55:56.366 --> 01:56:00.712
<i>Ce n'est rien. C'etait un cauchemar.</i>

01:56:02.664 --> 01:56:06.510
<i>Bien,</i> Mr Ratchett-
May you now have pleasant dreams.

01:56:35.405 --> 01:56:38.124
At 1:15 came
Mrs Hubbard's announcement

01:56:38.241 --> 01:56:40.164
that there was a man in her room,

01:56:40.285 --> 01:56:44.006
who had, for reasons which I dare not
even guess, shed a button.

01:56:44.122 --> 01:56:46.500
The next morning,
the murder was discovered.

01:56:46.625 --> 01:56:50.346
Dr Constantine sets the time
of the murder

01:56:50.462 --> 01:56:54.137
anywhere between midnight and 2:00am.

01:56:54.257 --> 01:56:57.978
Now, I came to various conclusions.

01:56:58.094 --> 01:57:04.101
The clumsy cliche of the smashed watch
15

01:57:04.226 --> 01:57:08.026
had been done deliberately
to excite my disbelief.

01:57:09.564 --> 01:57:12.989
And since Mr McQueen had
overemphatically said

01:57:13.109 --> 01:57:15.578
that Ratchett spoke no languages,

01:57:15.695 --> 01:57:20.826
I was being deliberately manoeuvred into
believing that Ratchett was already dead

01:57:20.951 --> 01:57:24.376
when a voice cried out from his room
in French.

01:57:24.496 --> 01:57:25.839
In other words,

01:57:25.956 --> 01:57:32.214
I was being forced into the theory that
the murder was committed before 1:15.

01:57:32.337 --> 01:57:37.935
A period for which every single
one of you had an unshakable alibi.

01:57:39.177 --> 01:57:46.482
But... supposing that the crime had
not been committed earlier,

01:57:46.601 --> 01:57:49.445
but later than 1:15...

01:57:50.855 --> 01:57:56.862
when all the noises and incidents
designed to confuse rne had died down.

01:57:56.987 --> 01:58:04.292
And I had lapsed into sleep
because the train was now silent...

01:58:05.495 --> 01:58:07.372
and at peace.

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:11.843
Silent, yes.

01:58:13.878 --> 01:58:15.551
At peace, no.

01:58:16.548 --> 01:58:20.974
By two o'clock, the murder was afoot.

01:58:23.263 --> 01:58:24.856
Envisage it.

01:58:55.795 --> 01:58:59.265
For my daughter. My granddaughter.

01:59:13.563 --> 01:59:16.407
In memory of Colonel Armstrong.

01:59:16.524 --> 01:59:20.279
A great soldier
and an even greater friend.

01:59:26.368 --> 01:59:30.874
And for Mrs Armstrong. They took me
into their home and their hearts.

01:59:39.089 --> 01:59:41.512
For their Daisy and mine.

01:59:44.135 --> 01:59:46.513
Oh, God, forgive me.

02:00:00.694 --> 02:00:04.449
<i>For my... my sister and my... niece.</i>

02:00:07.117 --> 02:00:11.714
Cassetti. For the grief you brought
to my beloved wife.

02:00:20.922 --> 02:00:24.051
<i>Vigliacco.</i>

02:00:33.059 --> 02:00:34.936
<i>Schweinehund</i>

02:00:40.984 --> 02:00:44.204
For my beloved goddaughter.

02:00:56.958 --> 02:01:01.054
For Mother Armstrong... from Hector.

02:01:10.472 --> 02:01:12.349
For my gentleman.

02:01:23.610 --> 02:01:26.955
To Paulette, with love.

02:01:35.789 --> 02:01:43.389
And with mine, God rest
the soul of my dear, dead daughter.

02:02:14.410 --> 02:02:15.957
I repeat.

02:02:17.914 --> 02:02:21.214
A repulsive murderer

02:02:21.334 --> 02:02:28.513
has himself been repulsively
and, perhaps, deservedly murdered.

02:02:30.176 --> 02:02:34.602
But in which of the two ways
that I have suggested?

02:02:35.765 --> 02:02:41.192
In the simpler way, by the Mafioso
disguised as a wagon-lit conductor?

02:02:43.231 --> 02:02:47.702
Or in the more complex way
that I have just outlined...

02:02:49.529 --> 02:02:54.535
which involves many questions
and, of course...

02:02:55.952 --> 02:02:57.954
considerable scandal?

02:03:00.039 --> 02:03:04.385
Signor Bianchi, it is for you,
<i>as</i> a director of the line,

02:03:04.502 --> 02:03:07.756
to choose the solution that
we shall offer to the police at Brod.

02:03:07.881 --> 02:03:12.307
Though I confess... I am in two minds.

02:03:14.721 --> 02:03:16.098
<i>Though I...</i>

02:03:18.474 --> 02:03:26.154
I think the police at Brod would prefer
the simplicity of the first solution.

02:03:40.413 --> 02:03:43.087
We have the uniform...

02:03:44.500 --> 02:03:45.968
to show the police.

02:03:47.587 --> 02:03:51.308
If we have the uniform,
there must have been a man in it.

02:03:53.301 --> 02:03:58.273
So therefore,
I elect the first solution.

02:03:58.389 --> 02:03:59.515
Hear, hear.

02:04:25.583 --> 02:04:29.258
Hercule. I thank you.

02:04:31.297 --> 02:04:32.799
My friend.

02:04:32.924 --> 02:04:38.476
Now I must go and wrestle with my report
to the police and with my conscience.

02:04:46.479 --> 02:04:47.822
Mama?
