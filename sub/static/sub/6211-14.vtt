WEBVTT

00:01.400 --> 00:03.868
A peanut butter, banana
and vitamin sandwich?

00:03.936 --> 00:05.303
I'm intrigued.
It's Career
Day at school,

00:05.370 --> 00:06.538
and I have
to figure out

00:06.606 --> 00:08.006
what I'm going to
do with my life,

00:08.074 --> 00:11.409
so, hopefully, a diet
rich in Jif and zinc will help.

00:11.510 --> 00:13.111
Well, if you'd like
to get a head start

00:13.179 --> 00:15.213
I have a witch aptitude test
on my laptop.

00:15.281 --> 00:16.146
Is it accurate?

00:16.181 --> 00:17.148
Are you kidding?

00:17.216 --> 00:19.584
Not only did it
peg me 100%,

00:19.618 --> 00:21.485
but I got into Wellesley.

00:21.520 --> 00:22.286
Okay, I'll try it.

00:22.455 --> 00:23.321
Just put your finger

00:23.422 --> 00:24.489
on the asterisk key,

00:24.523 --> 00:25.990
and it'll show you
your future.

00:26.092 --> 00:27.291
Don't you quit on me.

00:27.359 --> 00:29.928
I need four milligrams
of epi, STAT!

00:29.995 --> 00:31.829
And something for my tummy.

00:34.200 --> 00:36.334
(gurney crashes)

00:36.401 --> 00:37.702
Okay,

00:37.736 --> 00:39.470
either I'm going
to spend my future

00:39.538 --> 00:40.905
being sued
for malpractice

00:40.973 --> 00:42.106
or that test
is wrong.

00:42.174 --> 00:44.275
Salem, did you tamper
with this test?

00:44.343 --> 00:45.410
Took, tampered with--

00:45.478 --> 00:48.346
a cat's got to do
what a cat's got to do.

00:51.217 --> 00:53.685
Tell Elton John
he can start singing now.

00:53.753 --> 00:56.287

You know what I hate
about Career Day?

01:30.856 --> 01:32.624
It makes you think
about your future.

01:32.692 --> 01:34.659
I don't know.
Some of these lectures

01:34.760 --> 01:36.094
are pretty nap-friendly.

01:36.162 --> 01:38.463
Spellman, Kinkle,
new girl.

01:38.531 --> 01:40.197
I'm not new. I've
been here all year.

01:40.265 --> 01:41.432
Surly new girl.

01:41.500 --> 01:43.100
Detention.

01:43.168 --> 01:45.002
That's it?
No calling us "miscreants"?

01:45.004 --> 01:46.837
No resenting us for our youth?

01:46.905 --> 01:47.739
Why bother?

01:47.807 --> 01:49.608
Oh, sure,
when I became principal

01:49.675 --> 01:50.942
I had a dream.

01:51.010 --> 01:54.045
Mandatory "yes, sirs,"
corporal punishment,

01:54.113 --> 01:55.379
scratchy woolen shorts,

01:55.447 --> 01:56.314
but my hands
are tied

01:56.382 --> 01:57.748
by the school board.

01:57.816 --> 01:59.451
And the century.

01:59.518 --> 02:01.252
Yeah, when you look
in the mirror

02:01.319 --> 02:04.722
and the man staring back is just
an ineffectual figurehead,

02:04.790 --> 02:07.959
crushing young dreams
just ain't what it used to be.

02:09.529 --> 02:11.062
That's kind of sad.

02:11.062 --> 02:14.032
He used to really revel
in being unjustly mean.

02:14.099 --> 02:17.335
Hey, you want to check out
the "world needs corn" booth.

02:17.402 --> 02:20.705
Can't. I have an
appointment to talk
to a career counselor.

02:20.773 --> 02:23.141
He's going to help
me whittle my
options down

02:23.208 --> 02:24.642
from "anything
but a doctor."

02:24.710 --> 02:26.845
It's good that you're thinking
about your future.

02:26.912 --> 02:29.146
You are clearly
at a crucial crossroad.

02:29.214 --> 02:30.514
Mm-hmm. Well,
thank you

02:30.582 --> 02:32.583
for offering me
that shred of hope.

02:32.651 --> 02:35.720
Oh, and, uh, here's
the literature
you requested.

02:35.788 --> 02:39.057
Although I have
to tell you that

02:39.125 --> 02:41.359
rodeo clowning might be rough
on a man your age.

02:41.427 --> 02:43.895
Duly noted.

02:45.264 --> 02:47.365
Mr. Kraft wants
to change careers!

02:47.433 --> 02:49.100
Yes!

02:49.168 --> 02:52.971
(choir singing "hallelujah")

02:53.039 --> 02:56.407
So, Mr. Kraft
is soon to be ex-principal

02:56.475 --> 02:58.009
of my little hallways.

02:58.077 --> 02:59.644
Which explains
why you're floating on air.

02:59.711 --> 03:00.979
But you better
get down.

03:01.046 --> 03:03.314
Your aunt Eileen
lost an eye that way.

03:08.587 --> 03:11.256
I just hope Mr. Kraft
doesn't try and move in here.

03:11.324 --> 03:14.559
Nothing's sadder than a man
who freeloads off a woman.

03:14.627 --> 03:16.627
May I remind you

03:16.695 --> 03:18.329
that I'm a <i>cat.</i>

03:18.397 --> 03:19.363
Should we tell Zelda?

03:19.431 --> 03:20.865
No, she'll use her common sense

03:20.933 --> 03:22.767
to try to talk him
into staying there

03:22.835 --> 03:23.801
and playing it safe.

03:23.869 --> 03:26.271
I just got off the phone
with Willard.

03:26.339 --> 03:28.539
He's having an
identity crisis.

03:28.607 --> 03:30.341
He's not sure if he's
actually human?

03:30.408 --> 03:31.342
No!

03:31.410 --> 03:33.711
He wants to change jobs.

03:33.779 --> 03:34.745
And you talked him
out of it.

03:34.813 --> 03:35.913
Of course not.

03:35.981 --> 03:37.348
You are so good for him.

03:37.416 --> 03:40.317
I encouraged Willard
to take a leave of absence

03:40.385 --> 03:41.919
and-and go
find a job

03:41.987 --> 03:43.821
that will make him happy.

03:43.889 --> 03:46.223
Yes! And you might
want to mention that Mexico

03:46.359 --> 03:48.058
is brimming
with opportunities.

03:48.126 --> 03:50.295
I hope he takes your advice,
but I doubt Willard Kraft

03:50.362 --> 03:53.097
would leave a job
where he gets free pens.

03:53.165 --> 03:55.299
KRAFT (over PA):
And so, with a heavy heart,
I resign

03:55.367 --> 03:57.201
as principal of Westbridge High.

03:57.270 --> 03:58.436
(applause and cheering)

03:58.503 --> 04:00.204
I prayed for this day!

04:00.272 --> 04:03.874
(band plays victorious march)

04:06.211 --> 04:08.479
Well, I'm sure
those kids were
just punchy.

04:08.547 --> 04:12.283
Well, maybe I'm being paranoid
because the bacchanal happened

04:12.350 --> 04:14.686
immediately
after the announcement.

04:14.753 --> 04:18.423
Well, you were right
to keep those pens.

04:18.491 --> 04:20.725
How am I going
to pick a new career?

04:20.793 --> 04:22.460
I just fell into academics.

04:22.528 --> 04:26.530
Well, after I failed
the post office exam.

04:26.598 --> 04:29.900
You just need
to try new things.

04:29.968 --> 04:31.002
I'm scared, Zoo-Zoo.

04:31.103 --> 04:36.173
I mean, what if people
scowl at me and say mean things?

04:36.241 --> 04:39.977
You've dealt with that
wonderfully for years.

04:40.045 --> 04:41.279
Willard Kraft,

04:41.346 --> 04:43.347
you are a brilliant
and talented man.

04:43.415 --> 04:47.118
I want you
to follow your dreams.

04:47.186 --> 04:49.354
I'll do it.

04:49.421 --> 04:52.656

05:01.700 --> 05:05.503

05:14.613 --> 05:18.783
¶ ¶

05:23.522 --> 05:27.425
Just think of all the jobs
you know you don't want now.

05:27.492 --> 05:29.727
I got to tell you, I
am seriously thinking

05:29.795 --> 05:31.529
of taking my job back
at the high school.

05:31.596 --> 05:33.164
You can't!

05:33.232 --> 05:35.133
I mean, you just
have to stick to it

05:35.201 --> 05:37.635
until you find a job
that's suited for you.

05:37.703 --> 05:40.204
I tried. I've got
the scabs to prove it.

05:40.272 --> 05:41.472
So it might
take a while.

05:41.540 --> 05:42.673
I mean,
look at me.

05:42.741 --> 05:45.276
I found my dream
job at the coffeehouse.

05:45.344 --> 05:48.179
Sabrina, say
hello to your
new shift partner

05:48.247 --> 05:49.547
Will.

05:49.615 --> 05:51.982
As in, "I've lost
the will to live"?

05:52.050 --> 05:53.284
No, just Will.

05:53.352 --> 05:55.420
Now that I'm behind
Gen-X enemy lines,

05:55.487 --> 05:58.523
I thought I'd go with something
a little more with-it.

05:58.590 --> 06:00.525
You've got to help me
get Mr. Kraft out of there.

06:00.592 --> 06:01.992
A coffeehouse should be
a sanctuary.

06:02.060 --> 06:03.060
Amen. Don't worry.

06:03.128 --> 06:04.729
We'll figure
something out.

06:04.796 --> 06:06.197
Oh, and we can't tell
Aunt Zelda.

06:06.264 --> 06:08.165
She'd never want me to interfere
with Mr. Kraft's life.

06:08.233 --> 06:11.301
You've got to help me
get Willard out of
that coffeehouse.

06:11.369 --> 06:13.538
We do? I mean,
absolutely!

06:13.605 --> 06:15.940
What is an intelligent, talented
man doing wasting his time

06:16.008 --> 06:17.976
in some pathetic
little hole-in-the-wall?

06:18.043 --> 06:18.843
Hey.

06:18.911 --> 06:20.477
I mean, absolutely!

06:20.545 --> 06:22.647
He just needs to remember
his childhood dreams.

06:22.715 --> 06:23.647
You know what?

06:23.715 --> 06:25.316
I am going out
and get him a copy

06:25.384 --> 06:27.118
of <i>What Color</i>
<i>Is Your Parachute?</i>

06:27.186 --> 06:29.454
Oh, what a sweet idea.

06:29.521 --> 06:30.621
It will never work.

06:30.689 --> 06:32.456
You'd better use magic.

06:32.524 --> 06:35.226
All Willard
needs is a shot
of "Dream Come True."

06:35.294 --> 06:37.028
Sounds very "golden age
of Hollywood."

06:42.534 --> 06:44.402
All you have to do
is squirt him,
and he'll become

06:44.470 --> 06:45.870
what he wanted to be
when he was a child.

06:45.938 --> 06:47.338
Oh, so he'll have to quit
the coffeehouse,

06:47.405 --> 06:49.340
and we'll go back
to having repeat customers.

06:49.407 --> 06:50.975
Let's test it out.

06:53.412 --> 06:56.547
I'm not scratching
the furniture!

06:56.615 --> 07:00.718
(sobbing softly)

07:00.785 --> 07:03.153
Finally, I'm a guy
in red suspenders.

07:03.221 --> 07:05.756
Get in line, ladies.

07:05.824 --> 07:07.525
Beautiful. Well,
I'll thank you later

07:07.593 --> 07:09.159
but first I have to go
shoot Will

07:09.227 --> 07:10.861
before he gets
something pierced.

07:10.929 --> 07:12.163
Two cappuccinos.

07:13.231 --> 07:14.231
Mr. Kraft?

07:14.299 --> 07:15.966
(chuckles)
You left your job for this?

07:16.034 --> 07:18.936
Oh, yeah, that gig
was strictly L-7.

07:19.004 --> 07:23.841
Hey, you two peepsters savvy
to any raves this weekend?

07:26.111 --> 07:28.612
I'll just get
those cappuccinos.

07:30.348 --> 07:32.216
This is like a mercy killing.

07:33.018 --> 07:34.319
Wow, Sabrina.

07:34.386 --> 07:36.186
He wasn't bothering
us that much.

07:36.254 --> 07:38.088
Oh, this is all part
of the training.

07:38.156 --> 07:40.124
Police that slop tray.
Now, mister!

07:40.192 --> 07:41.359
(gasps)

07:41.426 --> 07:44.596
Ooh, I have someplace
very important to go.

07:44.663 --> 07:47.965
Just call me
the little Kraft who could.

07:48.033 --> 07:51.102
And just call me
the dream weaver.

07:53.004 --> 07:53.938
Think fast, Kinkle!

07:54.006 --> 07:54.405
Brad, don't!

07:55.140 --> 07:58.342
SABRINA:
No...!

07:59.878 --> 08:01.178
You got me.

08:01.246 --> 08:03.347
And it was my last day
on the force.

08:03.414 --> 08:04.982
Harvey. Harvey,
speak to me.

08:05.050 --> 08:06.917
I think he's going to survive.

08:06.985 --> 08:08.653
What do you
think this is,
some kind of toy?

08:08.720 --> 08:10.254
JOSH:
Hey, that guy's

08:10.322 --> 08:11.322
stealing the tip jar.

08:11.390 --> 08:13.024
Citizens

08:13.091 --> 08:14.158
go about
your business.

08:22.133 --> 08:24.868
Mighty Teen
to the rescue!

08:24.936 --> 08:27.571
I believe this is yours.

08:27.639 --> 08:29.239
(man grunts)
And I believe that's

08:29.307 --> 08:31.609
frightened criminal
for "I'm sorry."

08:31.677 --> 08:33.110
(bystanders gasp)

08:36.782 --> 08:39.450
Mighty Teen, away!

08:41.453 --> 08:42.785
Was that Kinkle?!

08:42.854 --> 08:43.854
Was he flying?

08:43.922 --> 08:45.557
Yeah, that was Harvey flying.

08:45.624 --> 08:48.459
He was trying to get away
from Bigfoot and Elvis.

08:48.526 --> 08:50.962
(chuckling):
No more caffeine for you two.

08:56.434 --> 08:57.835
There's got to be
a way to reverse

08:57.903 --> 08:59.136
this dream-come-true spell.

08:59.204 --> 09:01.105
Here-- "once someone
lives out their
childhood dream

09:01.172 --> 09:02.940
the spell
will automatically end."

09:03.008 --> 09:05.075
Great. Well, Harvey obviously
wanted to be a super hero,

09:05.143 --> 09:07.044
and now that he's saved the day
at the coffeehouse,

09:07.112 --> 09:08.412
he's fulfilled
his childhood dream.

09:08.480 --> 09:09.514
I bet he's

09:09.581 --> 09:11.315
back to normal already.

09:15.020 --> 09:16.053
I got to get curtains.

09:16.120 --> 09:17.888
You got to reverse that spell.

09:19.124 --> 09:21.859
Excuse me, but your cat
was stuck up a tree.

09:21.927 --> 09:24.495
Got a real kick
out of his little fireman suit.

09:25.730 --> 09:29.566
Well, you're brave, virile
and easily entertained.

09:29.634 --> 09:30.868
Come back next week.

09:30.936 --> 09:32.769
He's going to
be Abe Lincoln.

09:32.871 --> 09:35.106
Yeah, I better go.
The guys are going
to get together

09:35.174 --> 09:36.908
and watch the fights,
eat some chili.

09:39.445 --> 09:41.912
Just the guys, hanging around
in our skivvies,

09:41.980 --> 09:43.781
loading up
on the musical fruit

09:43.849 --> 09:45.550
and watching
the sweet science,

09:45.617 --> 09:46.684
and I'm not there?

09:46.752 --> 09:49.587
I got to convince them
I'm a real fireman.

09:50.756 --> 09:53.757
Try losing the tail.

09:53.826 --> 09:57.161
Oh, if you're
thinking of trying
that matchmaking service

09:57.229 --> 09:59.663
take it from me--
specify "mammal."

09:59.665 --> 10:02.266
I just read an e-mail
from Willard.

10:02.334 --> 10:04.168
He sounds so happy.

10:04.269 --> 10:06.437
He says he's going
to follow his dream.

10:06.538 --> 10:07.371
Really?

10:07.439 --> 10:08.539
Whatever could have
gotten onto...?

10:08.607 --> 10:10.341
I mean, <i>into</i> him?

10:10.376 --> 10:11.876
I wonder
what his dream is.

10:11.944 --> 10:15.379
You know, is it a doctor
or statesman or...?

10:15.414 --> 10:18.649
(making airplane noises)

10:18.717 --> 10:19.650
This.

10:19.718 --> 10:21.853
Request clearance for sugar.

10:23.555 --> 10:25.656
Oh, look, it's Baron
von Emergency Landing.

10:25.724 --> 10:26.957
(sarcastic laughter)

10:27.025 --> 10:29.493
You know, they all laughed
at Lindbergh, too.

10:29.628 --> 10:32.663
But that'll change
when I realize my lifelong dream

10:32.731 --> 10:35.533
of recreating his flight
across the Atlantic

10:35.601 --> 10:38.036
in a tiny two-seater.

10:39.505 --> 10:40.972
It certainly
is a strange--

10:41.039 --> 10:43.874
some might even
say delusional-- dream,

10:43.942 --> 10:47.211
but... good for you.

10:47.279 --> 10:49.046
You have to admit, uh, I look...

10:49.113 --> 10:52.149
(English accent):
awfully dashing in goggles.

10:53.285 --> 10:54.619
What's with
the glasses?

10:54.686 --> 10:56.654
Oh, I've had these
for a while.

10:56.722 --> 10:59.156
I mainly use them
for sleeping.

10:59.258 --> 11:02.092
Harvey, I know
your childhood dream
was to be Mighty Teen.

11:02.194 --> 11:05.396
I've never met the lad,
but I hear he's a nice fellow.

11:05.464 --> 11:07.765
I need to know,
what mission does
he have to fulfill

11:07.833 --> 11:09.599
or motto does he
have to live up to?

11:09.668 --> 11:12.736
Mighty Teen was put on this
earth to save the world.

11:12.771 --> 11:14.104
The whole world?

11:14.206 --> 11:16.640
Or so I've been told.

11:16.675 --> 11:18.709
These bathrooms
are nothing but trouble.

11:18.777 --> 11:20.411
They always run out
of toilet paper.

11:20.446 --> 11:21.612
Trouble?

11:21.679 --> 11:23.481
Excuse me, I just remembered.

11:23.548 --> 11:25.383
I left my notebook in...

11:25.451 --> 11:26.517
this classroom.

11:28.053 --> 11:30.087
When there's trouble around,

11:30.155 --> 11:32.022
Mighty Teen will be found.

11:32.091 --> 11:33.223
Oh, super.

11:33.292 --> 11:34.558
Not Superteen.

11:34.626 --> 11:35.926
Mighty Teen!

11:37.629 --> 11:39.830
Kinkle,
what are you doing?

11:41.500 --> 11:43.767
This is one great
senior prank, huh?

11:43.802 --> 11:46.337
And yet there's nothing funny
about poor hygiene, ma'am.

11:47.072 --> 11:49.907
Mighty Teen, away!

11:51.477 --> 11:53.677
I have to admit-- he really
pulls off that cape.

11:53.712 --> 11:55.980
Do you think bringing an economy
size roll of toilet paper

11:56.047 --> 11:58.115
to an empty bathroom would
fulfill Mighty Teen's quest... ?

11:59.184 --> 12:01.252
I'm going to stop talking now.

12:01.319 --> 12:02.319
Well?

12:02.387 --> 12:03.820
What do you think?

12:03.888 --> 12:05.722
I wanted it to be just
like Lindbergh's.

12:05.790 --> 12:06.891
Wow.

12:06.959 --> 12:08.459
Looks nothing
like Lindbergh's

12:08.526 --> 12:10.962
and yet, even though
you used modern materials

12:11.029 --> 12:12.763
you managed
to make it so much...

12:12.831 --> 12:14.732
less safe.

12:14.800 --> 12:15.866
(chuckles)

12:15.934 --> 12:17.468
Guess what I
named her after?

12:17.536 --> 12:20.171
Oh, Willard,
you didn't.

12:20.239 --> 12:21.304
Oh...

12:21.372 --> 12:22.473
you didn't.

12:22.541 --> 12:24.174
Yep. The <i>Spirit of Westbridge.</i>

12:24.242 --> 12:26.878
See, I want my flight to be
just like Lindy's--

12:26.945 --> 12:29.546
right down to only taking
one bologna sandwich

12:29.614 --> 12:32.683
and a tiny bottle of water
and a lawn chair to sit in.

12:32.751 --> 12:34.185
Um, dear?

12:34.252 --> 12:34.985
Mm-hmm?

12:35.053 --> 12:36.487
I think it's wonderful

12:36.554 --> 12:39.090
that you have your lunch meat
and your terribly rickety chair

12:39.157 --> 12:40.124
but what about

12:40.192 --> 12:42.359
the small matter
of flying experience?

12:42.427 --> 12:44.195
Oh, well, if I
get into trouble

12:44.263 --> 12:46.030
I'll just fly
square circles

12:46.098 --> 12:48.965
until I can latch onto
the proper longitude.

12:49.033 --> 12:50.100
My, my.

12:50.168 --> 12:51.501
You seem to have acquired

12:51.569 --> 12:54.404
a great deal of aviation
knowledge very suddenly...

12:54.472 --> 12:56.841
almost magically.

12:56.908 --> 12:58.242
Excuse me.

12:58.309 --> 13:01.711
I have to go see my sister
and... make some accusations.

13:01.779 --> 13:02.813
Somewhere in
these comic books

13:02.881 --> 13:04.047
there has to
be a story

13:04.115 --> 13:05.182
where Mighty Teen
saves the world.

13:05.249 --> 13:06.250
All we have to do
is recreate it

13:06.318 --> 13:07.818
and Harvey'll go
back to normal.

13:07.885 --> 13:10.621
Here's one where Mighty Teen
squeezes his radioactive zit

13:10.688 --> 13:12.489
on his archnemesis.

13:12.557 --> 13:13.991
Okay, gross,
and keep looking.

13:14.059 --> 13:16.260
You know, the good
thing about

13:16.327 --> 13:17.661
having changed Harvey
into a superhero

13:17.729 --> 13:19.463
is he'll never
feel pain or die.

13:19.531 --> 13:21.498
You obviously didn't read
issue number 64,

13:21.566 --> 13:23.200
where he died....
painfully.

13:23.268 --> 13:24.702
Sorry.

13:24.769 --> 13:26.203
Okay, more good news.

13:26.271 --> 13:27.671
(siren wails)

13:27.739 --> 13:29.440
What is that?

13:29.508 --> 13:32.009
This is Red Eagle
to Squad Leader.

13:32.077 --> 13:32.943
We are in progress.

13:33.011 --> 13:34.111
(static bursts)

13:34.179 --> 13:37.581
Do you smell smoke?

13:37.649 --> 13:38.749
(grunts)

13:38.817 --> 13:40.384
Nothing to worry about, folks.

13:40.452 --> 13:43.721
Keep it moving,
and let the fireman do his job.

13:43.788 --> 13:45.022
I hate to interfere
with a pro,

13:45.090 --> 13:46.690
so I have no problem
doing this.

13:49.361 --> 13:50.627
But I wanted to fight the fire

13:50.695 --> 13:52.663
and prevent our home
from incinerating.

13:52.731 --> 13:54.131
Who started this
fire, anyway?

13:54.198 --> 13:54.999
Me.

13:55.066 --> 13:55.999
ZELDA:
Hilda?

13:56.067 --> 13:58.969
Did you put some
sort of spell
on Willard?

13:59.037 --> 14:00.504
I can honestly
tell you that, yes,

14:00.571 --> 14:01.672
there is a
spell on him,

14:01.740 --> 14:03.573
and I can honestly
tell you that, no,

14:03.641 --> 14:05.042
<i>I</i> didn't do it.

14:05.110 --> 14:07.444
You know, it would have been
a lot easier just to say

14:07.512 --> 14:08.812
"Sabrina did it," Aunt Snitch.

14:08.880 --> 14:09.880
Sabrina,

14:09.947 --> 14:11.781
you are in serious trouble.

14:11.849 --> 14:12.783
(rumbling)

14:12.851 --> 14:14.952
Where there's trouble around,

14:15.019 --> 14:17.288
Mighty Teen will be found!

14:17.356 --> 14:19.089
Obviously, one of
Mighty Teen's powers

14:19.157 --> 14:20.123
is eavesdropping.

14:20.191 --> 14:23.227
Let the girl go, oh, dark one!

14:23.295 --> 14:24.695
I'm her aunt!

14:24.763 --> 14:26.130
SABRINA:
It's okay.

14:26.197 --> 14:28.632
I did something wrong,
and my aunt was upset with me.

14:28.699 --> 14:29.733
A false alarm.

14:29.801 --> 14:33.738
Much like the conundrum I faced
in issue number 15:

14:33.805 --> 14:35.772
"Requiem for a Mutant."

14:35.840 --> 14:37.441
Mighty Teen, away!

14:37.509 --> 14:40.277
Criminals, beware!

14:40.344 --> 14:41.278
You've warned them.

14:41.346 --> 14:42.513
Isn't that enough?

14:42.581 --> 14:43.647
That was odd

14:43.715 --> 14:45.148
but Harvey's strange behavior

14:45.216 --> 14:47.418
couldn't have anything to do
with Willard's.

14:47.486 --> 14:48.686
I mean,
there is no spell

14:48.753 --> 14:51.355
that would make Willard
want to fly across the ocean

14:51.423 --> 14:53.056
and turn Harvey
into a superhero.

14:53.124 --> 14:55.225
Uh-huh. "Dream come true"...

14:55.293 --> 14:58.361
or whatever you call
that thing you made.

14:58.429 --> 14:59.430
I knew it.

14:59.497 --> 15:01.932
You put a childhood
dream spell on Willard.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.500
Y-You said you wanted him

15:03.568 --> 15:05.002
to follow his dreams.

15:05.069 --> 15:07.671
He's flying to Paris
in a hunk of balsa wood!

15:07.739 --> 15:10.374
Oh... that thing'll
never get off the ground.

15:10.442 --> 15:11.875
(engine roaring)

15:16.615 --> 15:20.317
See you in 33 and a half hours!

15:22.587 --> 15:24.688
He seemed happy.

15:24.756 --> 15:25.923
Zellie, just
a thought

15:25.990 --> 15:28.592
but maybe you
should go along
with Willard

15:28.660 --> 15:30.393
so that he
doesn't, uh, die.

15:30.461 --> 15:31.728
I can't.

15:31.830 --> 15:33.597
Since Sabrina
put the spell on him

15:33.664 --> 15:35.198
only <i>she</i> can protect him.

15:35.266 --> 15:36.500
But I have to protect Harvey.

15:36.568 --> 15:38.469
Who knows what evil
he's chosen to fight.

15:38.536 --> 15:40.671
I mean, some criminals
can be downright mean.

15:40.739 --> 15:42.105
Sabrina, we
are in triage.

15:42.173 --> 15:45.041
My boyfriend's
situation is
worse right now,

15:45.109 --> 15:46.877
and he doesn't
have superpowers.

15:46.945 --> 15:48.045
All right, I'll go,

15:48.113 --> 15:49.980
but if you hear the anguished
screams of Mighty Teen

15:50.048 --> 15:52.149
will you please call
the Justice League of America?

15:54.553 --> 15:57.488
Boy, this spell
has <i>really</i> gotten
out of control.

15:57.556 --> 16:01.058
Bad Sabrina!

16:01.125 --> 16:03.627
WILLARD:
I'm free!

16:03.695 --> 16:07.530
Away from the world and
its mundane little annoyances!

16:07.598 --> 16:09.366
Hey!

16:09.433 --> 16:10.601
(screams)

16:10.669 --> 16:11.668
What are you doing here?

16:11.736 --> 16:12.869
Oh, I'm not
really here.

16:12.938 --> 16:14.538
I'm a phantom,

16:14.605 --> 16:15.806
just like Lindbergh
hallucinated

16:15.874 --> 16:17.507
after 20 hours
of flying.

16:17.575 --> 16:19.209
Yeah, but I've only been flying
a few minutes.

16:19.277 --> 16:20.711
Well, it's
a much more
fast-paced world.

16:20.779 --> 16:22.679
Look at MTV.

16:22.747 --> 16:24.281
(engine sputtering)

16:24.349 --> 16:27.017
What's that noise that sounds
like an engine failing?

16:27.085 --> 16:29.420
T-T-That would be
your-your engine failing--

16:29.487 --> 16:32.089
um, usually a sure sign
that we're going down.

16:32.157 --> 16:34.258
Tempting, but...

16:34.326 --> 16:35.593
(sputtering stops)

16:35.660 --> 16:37.861
That's it, baby.

16:37.929 --> 16:41.332
Yes. I knew you wouldn't
let me down.

16:41.433 --> 16:43.867
I hope you're
in the mood for burritos,

16:43.935 --> 16:48.471
'cause Paris, France,
here we come!

16:48.539 --> 16:50.240
E-6!

16:50.308 --> 16:51.942
Stop trying to sink
my battleship.

16:52.009 --> 16:54.678
I'm trying to trace
Willard and Sabrina's flight

16:54.746 --> 16:55.912
over the Atlantic.

16:55.980 --> 16:57.481
Well, I just want to tell you

16:57.549 --> 16:59.983
about me fulfilling
my childhood dream.

17:00.051 --> 17:00.884
Later.

17:00.952 --> 17:02.219
(muttering):
One Mississippi,

17:02.286 --> 17:03.286
two Mississippi...

17:03.354 --> 17:04.320
there I was--

17:04.388 --> 17:05.755
cut off from
my squadron

17:05.823 --> 17:07.023
and Lady Fahrenheit

17:07.092 --> 17:08.525
was cranking up the jet.

17:08.593 --> 17:09.660
With nothing more

17:09.728 --> 17:11.328
than my wits to arm me,

17:11.396 --> 17:15.566
I saved countless lives
by subduing a raging brushfire.

17:15.633 --> 17:18.202
<i>This</i> is coming out
of your allowance

17:18.269 --> 17:19.769
you little pyro!

17:21.204 --> 17:23.307
You know, I don't think
a daredevil like Lindy

17:23.374 --> 17:24.907
would settle
for a straight line.

17:24.976 --> 17:26.476
Let's make this interesting.

17:28.079 --> 17:29.279
Stop!

17:29.347 --> 17:32.149
Where is your
sense of adventure?

17:32.216 --> 17:33.884
In my throat
along with my stomach.

17:43.227 --> 17:44.227
Ow!

17:44.295 --> 17:45.462
Whoa! That was fun!

17:45.530 --> 17:47.164
I can't straighten
my finger out.

17:47.232 --> 17:48.899
Yeah, well,
why would you need to?

17:48.967 --> 17:50.467
Just leave the driving
to us.

17:50.535 --> 17:52.035
¶ Come fly with me ¶

17:52.103 --> 17:53.537
¶ Let's float, let's... ¶

17:53.604 --> 17:57.541
Oh, sweet mother of mercy,
we're out of gas.

17:59.544 --> 18:01.378
Oh, no! My magic's out!

18:01.446 --> 18:04.548
I knew I shouldn't have used
the dials off of mother's stove!

18:04.616 --> 18:06.550
No. It must
have been because
I jammed my finger.

18:06.618 --> 18:08.818
Look, will you shut up
about your finger!

18:08.886 --> 18:10.054
I don't understand this.

18:10.121 --> 18:12.956
I filled this plane with the
<i>exact</i> same amount of gas

18:13.023 --> 18:14.491
that Lindy did.

18:14.559 --> 18:16.059
Yeah, but Lindbergh didn't waste
all of his gas

18:16.127 --> 18:17.561
circling over
the Carnival cruise ships

18:17.595 --> 18:19.062
trying to get a glimpse
of Kathie Lee!

18:19.130 --> 18:20.931
Oh, I just can't
wait and worry.

18:20.998 --> 18:22.399
Oh, don't be such
a worrywitch.

18:22.467 --> 18:24.468
Sabrina and Willard
are going to be fine

18:24.536 --> 18:27.104
and if anything goes wrong,
Sabrina has her magic.

18:27.172 --> 18:29.372
SABRINA:
I guess this is it!

18:29.440 --> 18:30.574
No. No, no!

18:30.642 --> 18:32.843
No. <i>This</i> is it!

18:32.911 --> 18:34.645
Mr. Kraft, this may
be my last chance

18:34.712 --> 18:36.313
to tell you how
I feel about you.

18:36.381 --> 18:38.415
Well, there's something I want
to share with you, too, Sabrina.

18:38.483 --> 18:40.183
Me first.
You're an idiot!

18:40.251 --> 18:41.418
You didn't even
buy enough gas,

18:41.486 --> 18:43.553
and now we're going
down, you shovelhead!

18:43.621 --> 18:45.389
Well, you give deadweight
a bad name,

18:45.457 --> 18:47.023
you whiny little stowaway!

18:47.091 --> 18:48.792
Oh...

18:48.860 --> 18:51.261
This is taking
an awfully long time.

18:51.329 --> 18:52.496
And it hasn't
even hurt yet.

18:52.564 --> 18:54.030
Are you on
the rainbow bridge

18:54.098 --> 18:56.633
being greeted by family members
and old pets?

18:56.701 --> 18:58.134
We're flying again.

18:58.202 --> 18:59.303
Look!

18:59.371 --> 19:01.272
What?

19:01.339 --> 19:02.939
But... how?

19:03.007 --> 19:05.742
And where's that music
coming from?

19:05.810 --> 19:08.278
When trouble's around, Mighty
Teen really <i>will</i> be found!

19:18.189 --> 19:20.690
My hero!

19:20.758 --> 19:23.293
That sounds so phony in comic
books, but now I get it.

19:23.361 --> 19:25.362
Well, the emotions
in comic books are real.

19:25.430 --> 19:27.598
Just don't send away
for the X-ray specs.

19:27.666 --> 19:28.899
Ow! Oh...

19:28.967 --> 19:30.100
I hurt my finger

19:30.167 --> 19:32.302
in the world's most
ill-advised barrel roll.

19:32.369 --> 19:33.503
Well, lucky for you,

19:33.571 --> 19:36.406
I have some teen Bactine
in my utility belt.

19:36.474 --> 19:38.742
At the risk
of being redundant--

19:38.810 --> 19:40.176
my hero!

19:40.244 --> 19:43.113
Often heard but
never tiresome.

19:43.181 --> 19:46.116
Has my childhood
dream come true?

19:46.184 --> 19:47.117
Are we in Paris?

19:47.184 --> 19:48.185
Yeah.

19:48.253 --> 19:49.386
I mean, <i>oui!</i>

19:49.454 --> 19:53.323
(screaming and cheering)

19:53.391 --> 19:55.692
This must be just
how Lindy felt.

19:55.760 --> 19:59.129
I wonder how long
it took <i>his</i> cheeks to wake up.

19:59.196 --> 20:02.800
Is there any way
I can talk you out of going off

20:02.867 --> 20:03.967
to save the world?

20:04.035 --> 20:05.636
But I already
saved it.

20:05.703 --> 20:08.038
<i>You're</i> my world.

20:08.105 --> 20:10.974
Now I know why superman
ruined Lois for other men.

20:11.042 --> 20:12.242
What?

20:12.310 --> 20:15.311
Uh... oh, essay

20:15.379 --> 20:17.213
for my "comic books
as literature" class.

20:17.281 --> 20:19.283
(cheering)
Hey, what's all that ruckus
over there?

20:19.350 --> 20:22.385
<i>Bonjour,</i>
<i>Monsieur</i>
<i>Fromage.</i>

20:22.453 --> 20:24.388
French embassy
come for Career Week?

20:24.489 --> 20:26.890
I-I think everyone
is just weirdly excited

20:26.958 --> 20:28.559
to welcome Mr. Kraft back.

20:28.626 --> 20:31.428
(victorious melody plays)

20:34.833 --> 20:36.133
So, Willard
remembers nothing?

20:36.200 --> 20:37.367
<i>Nada.</i>

20:37.435 --> 20:38.735
He's principal again

20:38.803 --> 20:40.870
and even though the hours are
long, the pay is short

20:40.938 --> 20:42.039
and he's still
ineffectual,

20:42.107 --> 20:44.675
he says he's never
been happier.

20:44.743 --> 20:46.343
So maybe it's time
for me to be out of the doghouse

20:46.411 --> 20:47.377
for my childhood
dream spell?

20:47.445 --> 20:48.612
It looks like it worked.

20:48.713 --> 20:50.314
Yeah, and that
"peace with yourself" spell

20:50.381 --> 20:52.349
that you put on Willard
didn't hurt either.

20:52.417 --> 20:53.650
Did it, Zellie?

20:53.718 --> 20:56.486
What?!
You really are
Aunt Snitch, aren't you?

20:59.357 --> 21:01.792
Why are you still
dressed like that?

21:01.860 --> 21:03.894
I thought you
fulfilled your
pitiful dream

21:03.962 --> 21:05.295
of ruining
my hairbrushes.

21:05.363 --> 21:07.096
I want people
to recognize me

21:07.164 --> 21:08.398
from the Four-alarm

21:08.466 --> 21:09.466
Fireman's Calendar.

21:09.533 --> 21:11.301
I'm Mr. November.

21:11.369 --> 21:14.404
Well, this will
certainly change
your image.

21:14.472 --> 21:16.973
I know, I know,
it's airbrushed.
