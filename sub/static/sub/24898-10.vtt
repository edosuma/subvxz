WEBVTT

00:01.089 --> 00:02.094
Here's the category!

00:02.118 --> 00:04.102
What is the title of my biography?

00:04.126 --> 00:07.137
What would be the title of
Harley Carter's biography?

00:07.444 --> 00:09.811
- Put it in the hat.
- I got this one on lock, kids.

00:09.860 --> 00:12.275
Let's go, Koji. Come on, you're
not writing the biography.

00:12.300 --> 00:13.501
Put it in there.

00:13.535 --> 00:16.123
Here we go, first answer.

00:16.405 --> 00:18.622
"A Worse Actor Than Me."

00:20.609 --> 00:22.174
Okay, that's obviously Dot.

00:22.199 --> 00:23.778
- Nope, Koji.
- Koji!

00:24.150 --> 00:26.502
- What?
- It's funny 'cause it's true.

00:26.669 --> 00:28.536
No, it's not true! It's not true.

00:28.884 --> 00:30.683
Okay, moving on.

00:31.186 --> 00:33.996
"Remember Him? Didn't Think So."

00:34.527 --> 00:37.158
That's dryly acerbic,
I'm going to go with Dave.

00:37.192 --> 00:40.001
Wait, no. Dot is acerbic, too.

00:40.229 --> 00:42.596
Yeah, but Dot always signs hers.

00:42.631 --> 00:45.332
Answer number three, "Harley Carter..."

00:45.469 --> 00:48.032
That's Dot's! I can tell from the sigh.
That is definitely Dot's.

00:48.057 --> 00:50.475
The Day He Found a Spider in His Shoe<

00:50.500 --> 00:52.783
"and Ran Away From Home. Dot Yasuda."

00:52.808 --> 00:54.975
That's a very specific biography.

00:55.010 --> 00:56.703
- She really signs it!
- Here we go.

00:56.885 --> 01:00.094
"The Defective Detective."

01:03.421 --> 01:07.155
- That's funny!
- No, it is. It's really funny.

01:07.611 --> 01:09.701
Yeah, well, I should have
gone with "The Dick-tective."

01:09.725 --> 01:11.920
Now, that is a good one!

01:11.945 --> 01:13.420
I considered that, too.

01:14.362 --> 01:16.731
There is this great board game/cafe

01:16.765 --> 01:18.324
called Monopuccino in Santa Monica.

01:18.502 --> 01:19.627
We should go next week.

01:21.269 --> 01:23.258
Um, when you're back at work.

01:23.946 --> 01:25.973
Thanks, Captain Buzzkill.

01:26.859 --> 01:28.107
End of hiatus.

01:28.243 --> 01:33.005
Hey, it's the "Call Carter table
read on Monday." It's a big day.

01:33.030 --> 01:35.538
Man, Vijay. I don't really
want to get into it now.

01:35.931 --> 01:37.084
Can we save, like,

01:37.118 --> 01:38.995
- the work stuff for a little bit later?
- Hello.

01:39.019 --> 01:40.073
Pardon me.

01:40.098 --> 01:41.206
New category!

01:42.296 --> 01:45.265
What would be the
title of Dot's action movie?

01:46.522 --> 01:49.551
I'm-I'm actually with him right now,
so I will tell him.

01:50.371 --> 01:51.433
Thanks.

01:52.727 --> 01:53.796
What happened?

01:55.543 --> 01:57.556
Tanner Ellison is dead.

01:59.355 --> 02:00.423
He's dead?

02:02.907 --> 02:04.571
Who's Tanner Ellison?

02:05.313 --> 02:08.753
Tanner Ellison is the animal
who killed Harley's mother.

02:11.990 --> 02:13.053
Your first case.

02:14.150 --> 02:15.670
The guy you caught when you were 12.

02:15.978 --> 02:18.126
The guy... we caught.

02:20.145 --> 02:21.181
What happened?

02:21.277 --> 02:22.704
He was murdered.

02:23.527 --> 02:26.808
And there was something written
on the floor of his cell...

02:27.609 --> 02:28.620
in his blood.

02:30.000 --> 02:36.074

03:13.555 --> 03:14.863
Are you sure you're up for this?

03:15.069 --> 03:16.246
Like I have a choice.

03:16.798 --> 03:17.798
I can handle it.

03:17.864 --> 03:19.112
You don't have to come in.

03:20.802 --> 03:22.362
All right, let's do it then.

03:29.982 --> 03:31.835
His name's Hennessy Cole.

03:32.335 --> 03:34.983
He was a model prisoner, until now.

03:35.921 --> 03:38.486
- Can we talk to him?
- I thought you might want to.

03:38.520 --> 03:40.100
That's why we haven't moved him yet.

03:46.299 --> 03:47.862
How do you know Tanner Ellison?

03:48.888 --> 03:51.533
- Didn't really know him at all.
- Then, why'd you kill him?

03:52.126 --> 03:54.301
- Well, somebody asked me to.
- Who?

03:54.778 --> 03:55.895
No idea.

03:56.637 --> 03:57.677
I got a letter.

03:58.105 --> 04:00.273
No return address,
and it had an offer in it.

04:01.799 --> 04:02.855
To do what?

04:04.136 --> 04:06.639
Well, my dad, he's sick.

04:07.568 --> 04:10.201
Yeah, hellacious pain like 24/7.

04:10.381 --> 04:11.485
And there's a treatment,

04:11.642 --> 04:15.165
but health care doesn't cover that.
And it wasn't cheap.

04:15.962 --> 04:19.059
So, you kill Tanner Ellison
and your father gets his treatment.

04:19.543 --> 04:22.651
Yeah, well, kill Tanner
and write "Call Carter" on the floor.

04:24.339 --> 04:26.957
Nothing personal. I was
just the sharp edge.

04:27.278 --> 04:28.402
You're a real hero.

04:29.161 --> 04:30.215
Where's the letter?

04:30.629 --> 04:32.816
I tore it up, flushed
it down the toilet.

04:33.792 --> 04:34.807
Why you?

04:36.456 --> 04:37.484
He's a lifer.

04:37.621 --> 04:38.654
Aha!

04:38.997 --> 04:40.731
Can't keep me here longer than forever.

04:42.575 --> 04:43.606
Though I got to say,

04:44.270 --> 04:46.122
I thought you'd be happy he's dead.

04:46.785 --> 04:47.815
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:47.840 --> 04:49.480
You don't care one bit
about my happiness.

04:49.562 --> 04:51.454
Hey, this deal wasn't personal, okay?

04:51.735 --> 04:53.186
Hell, I'm a big fan!

04:58.269 --> 05:00.401
I checked the
visitor's log for Cole. Nothing.

05:00.426 --> 05:02.104
I checked the hospital
where his father is.

05:02.128 --> 05:04.712
They received a bank draft
from a numbered corporation.

05:04.737 --> 05:06.240
Easy to do, impossible to trace.

05:06.274 --> 05:07.736
We'll check everything for prints.

05:07.863 --> 05:09.735
I think we need to look at my fans.

05:09.760 --> 05:12.315
- You think one of your fans did this?
- Fans do crazy things.

05:12.442 --> 05:13.942
Well, having a man murdered

05:13.967 --> 05:16.070
is about a mile and a
half past crazy, Harley.

05:16.203 --> 05:17.961
One of them sent me an ear once.

05:18.544 --> 05:20.955
- Somebody sent you their ear?
- Yeah, it wasn't theirs.

05:20.989 --> 05:23.501
- It was old. It was, like, mummified.
- What did you do with it?

05:23.525 --> 05:24.533
I put it with the others.

05:25.555 --> 05:26.986
I gave it to the police.

05:27.289 --> 05:29.673
My point is, maybe one of them

05:29.698 --> 05:30.948
read this new book that's coming out.

05:30.972 --> 05:32.595
The one that's about the killings.

05:33.181 --> 05:35.296
- Yeah, "A Darkness in Bishop."
- Yeah.

05:35.620 --> 05:38.114
It talks about how
Ellison killed my mom,

05:38.139 --> 05:39.740
and the killings made him famous.

05:39.774 --> 05:41.941
Maybe one of them read
that and they hated it.

05:42.465 --> 05:44.612
I'm going to take you home.
You need to stay put.

05:44.646 --> 05:46.614
How has "you need to stay put"

05:46.648 --> 05:48.983
worked out for you
these last few months?

05:49.017 --> 05:50.995
Come on, partner! We
need to stick together.

05:51.278 --> 05:52.897
That way, when I do something stupid

05:52.921 --> 05:54.421
you're close by to rescue me.

05:55.408 --> 05:56.632
Hey, Dot, what's going on?

05:58.920 --> 05:59.937
What?

06:02.476 --> 06:05.215
- Okay, I'll be right there.
- What?

06:06.090 --> 06:07.895
Cassidy is here.

06:08.942 --> 06:10.882
Cassidy? Your boss, Cassidy?

06:11.866 --> 06:13.616
You're on your own with
this one, partner.

06:14.476 --> 06:16.543
Look, I'm not arguing with you.

06:16.578 --> 06:19.308
Harley absolutely has to
be back to work on Monday.

06:19.333 --> 06:21.942
- I am agreeing with you on that.
- And two weeks ago,

06:21.967 --> 06:23.828
you promised me Harley
would be back in L.A.

06:23.853 --> 06:25.687
for wardrobe fittings,
which were last week.

06:25.867 --> 06:27.831
Yeah, but then he had a case.

06:27.856 --> 06:30.155
Dead guy on a snowmobile in the summer.

06:30.409 --> 06:32.010
Come on, classic "Call Carter".

06:32.480 --> 06:34.486
Maybe I'm not being clear, Mr. Gill.

06:34.877 --> 06:36.127
I don't care.

06:36.697 --> 06:38.338
I'm not here as Harley's friend,

06:38.463 --> 06:40.330
I'm here as the
showrunner of "Call Carter"

06:40.535 --> 06:42.380
and Harley has two years left
on a three-year contract.

06:42.404 --> 06:45.635
He is legally obligated to be
working for me again on Monday.

06:46.177 --> 06:48.265
Okay, well, I give you
my word as his agent.

06:49.059 --> 06:51.059
Do you know how much the
word of an agent is worth?

06:51.746 --> 06:53.491
I'm guessing you're thinking
of a very low number.

06:53.515 --> 06:54.815
- Guess lower.
- Yeah.

06:55.130 --> 06:56.684
Cassidy!

06:57.118 --> 06:58.602
Harley Carter.

07:00.024 --> 07:01.155
You still exist.

07:01.189 --> 07:03.710
Sorry I haven't been
answering your calls.

07:03.735 --> 07:05.669
Or texts or emails.

07:05.860 --> 07:07.327
We're supposed to be partners.

07:07.562 --> 07:09.062
No guilt tripping, okay?

07:09.087 --> 07:11.291
I was on hiatus. I needed a break.

07:12.861 --> 07:14.778
Break from reality is
what I've been hearing.

07:15.417 --> 07:16.919
And there it is, right there.

07:17.105 --> 07:18.222
The reason we split up.

07:18.862 --> 07:21.835
Wait. You two were a thing?
Like, you hooked up?

07:22.427 --> 07:24.717
Once, a long time ago.

07:25.447 --> 07:26.634
It didn't last.

07:27.115 --> 07:28.782
At least we got "Call Carter" out of it.

07:33.305 --> 07:34.384
Nice.

07:43.102 --> 07:44.109
Are you okay?

07:44.330 --> 07:46.400
No. But I'm good to go.

07:48.017 --> 07:50.471
What do you think of
the crazy fan angle?

07:50.822 --> 07:54.309
I hate it,
but we got to start somewhere.

07:55.931 --> 07:59.384
I put a couple of guys on
Harley's social media swamp.

07:59.948 --> 08:02.728
His Instagram account is a freak show.

08:05.281 --> 08:06.806
I was a patrolman back then.

08:07.712 --> 08:08.789
I know.

08:09.908 --> 08:12.431
I was at the scene when
they found the fifth victim.

08:13.525 --> 08:14.530
Lindy McLoud.

08:16.153 --> 08:18.131
I got cornered by a reporter,

08:18.709 --> 08:20.287
from the Bishop Spectator.

08:20.693 --> 08:21.902
Annie Carter.

08:22.952 --> 08:24.327
She was writing about the women.

08:24.869 --> 08:27.070
She was asking a lot of smart questions.

08:27.366 --> 08:28.842
Well, yeah, she was something.

08:29.611 --> 08:31.622
She said that she'd been
talking to some of the cops

08:31.646 --> 08:32.667
who were working the case,

08:32.691 --> 08:36.596
and she asked me if I had
any gut feelings about it.

08:36.650 --> 08:38.611
Like that's how all cops work.

08:39.190 --> 08:41.986
- Sound like anybody we know?
- Yeah, they're a lot alike.

08:44.268 --> 08:45.299
They were.

08:49.051 --> 08:50.425
Two days after that...

08:52.515 --> 08:53.574
she was gone.

08:55.293 --> 08:56.676
And a week later,

08:57.707 --> 09:00.174
Tanner Ellison killed his final victim.

09:03.930 --> 09:05.240
You tell Harley...

09:06.878 --> 09:07.959
I'm sorry.

09:08.329 --> 09:09.515
This can't be easy.

09:12.393 --> 09:13.476
I will.

09:24.310 --> 09:26.667
I worked pretty hard
to get my own office.

09:27.114 --> 09:28.161
Gotcha.

09:32.988 --> 09:34.555
Harley, I want you to know I get it.

09:34.801 --> 09:36.802
I understand how this is weird for you.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.975
Are you talking about next season,
or the murder?

09:39.454 --> 09:41.321
Both, I guess.

09:41.991 --> 09:44.936
You told me you were finally
ready to do the storyline

09:44.961 --> 09:47.960
where Charlie Carter finds out
what actually happens to his mother.

09:48.882 --> 09:52.051
Neil Patrick Harris is 90% on
board to play Tanner Ellison,

09:52.076 --> 09:53.743
but he will bail if you do.

09:54.006 --> 09:56.308
I said I was gonna read it, and I did.

09:56.512 --> 09:57.564
And?

09:57.599 --> 10:00.033
Look, Cassidy, you're a great writer.

10:00.189 --> 10:01.775
You know you are, but...

10:04.470 --> 10:08.211
The whole thing about Tanner
Ellison escaping from prison,

10:08.236 --> 10:12.125
knowing it's going to be played by NPH

10:12.150 --> 10:13.911
in crazy old man makeup?

10:13.936 --> 10:15.616
It's just sort of kicking
my ass right now.

10:15.717 --> 10:16.887
It's supposed to!

10:17.997 --> 10:19.051
You know we had a leak?

10:19.144 --> 10:22.101
The first script to next season ended
up online. Everybody loves it.

10:24.469 --> 10:26.272
Everybody but you, obviously.

10:28.393 --> 10:29.402
I'm sorry, Cass.

10:30.405 --> 10:32.241
It's just too weird for me.

10:34.808 --> 10:38.077
You know I love you,
but I can't protect you.

10:38.695 --> 10:40.962
If you're not back on set in three days,

10:41.327 --> 10:42.839
the studio's ready to
bring down the hammer.

10:42.863 --> 10:45.531
And Harley, they've shown me the hammer.

10:47.326 --> 10:49.137
I just feel like going
back to L.A. right now

10:49.162 --> 10:52.569
would be a totally different
kind of hammer for me.

10:54.553 --> 10:56.236
I don't even know why
you invited me up here

10:56.260 --> 10:57.854
if you were just going to tell me this.

10:59.190 --> 11:01.570
I didn't invite you up here.
What're you talking about?

11:01.595 --> 11:03.438
What are you talking about?
You sent me a letter.

11:03.462 --> 11:04.595
A letter?

11:04.636 --> 11:06.571
What is this, old timey cowboy times?

11:07.241 --> 11:08.405
It's your handwriting.

11:08.576 --> 11:10.358
I don't have handwriting anymore.

11:12.482 --> 11:14.924
I guess that's what my
handwriting used to look like.

11:17.117 --> 11:19.354
"Cass, come up to the Great White."

11:19.379 --> 11:21.525
I want to game plan
next season in person.

11:21.597 --> 11:22.635
Bring the ring.

11:22.719 --> 11:24.244
"I'll explain it when you get here."

11:24.914 --> 11:26.576
What ring?

11:28.539 --> 11:29.797
Hey.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.071
Hey, Harl, hey.

11:33.182 --> 11:35.352
You sounded weird on the phone.
What's up?

11:35.973 --> 11:39.840
Cassidy came up here because
she got an invite from me,

11:41.101 --> 11:42.524
except it wasn't from me.

11:42.684 --> 11:47.196
And also, someone sent her this.

11:51.110 --> 11:52.633
Is that what I think it is?

11:53.286 --> 11:54.515
Is that your mom's?

11:56.355 --> 11:58.835
But we never found her body.

12:00.397 --> 12:02.084
Well, somebody did.

12:10.312 --> 12:13.105
Okay, so let's assume that Tanner's
death and the ring are connected.

12:13.130 --> 12:14.183
Because they are.

12:14.208 --> 12:15.926
And Cassidy getting
lured up here, as well.

12:15.958 --> 12:18.684
Because she's writing about Tanner
Ellison for "Call Carter" maybe.

12:18.743 --> 12:21.613
So, maybe whoever this is
got the ring from Tanner.

12:26.525 --> 12:29.526
Okay, so what?
He had the ring all these years?

12:29.771 --> 12:31.472
Maybe Tanner had an accomplice?

12:31.497 --> 12:33.308
Maybe he wasn't acting
alone back in the day?

12:33.483 --> 12:35.618
But why the game? Why now?

12:37.273 --> 12:39.346
It's the 25th anniversary
of the killings.

12:41.028 --> 12:43.418
That book "A Darkness in
Bishop is about to come out".

12:43.443 --> 12:47.213
The first episode of my show's
new season got leaked online.

12:48.010 --> 12:49.917
And you know who all of
next season is about?

12:50.156 --> 12:51.379
Tanner Ellison.

12:51.723 --> 12:52.795
That's the "why now".

12:54.816 --> 12:56.210
All right, you know what we have to do?

12:56.234 --> 12:57.968
We have to look at all
the old case files.

12:57.993 --> 13:00.386
All the killings from 25 years ago.

13:00.411 --> 13:03.621
You know, friends, accomplices,
acquaintances. Let's just start there.

13:03.646 --> 13:04.950
Yeah, I was also going to suggest

13:04.974 --> 13:06.831
that we look through some
of your mom's old research.

13:06.855 --> 13:08.083
Did she keep any of her notes?

13:08.315 --> 13:10.271
I'm sure the newspaper
has all of her articles,

13:10.296 --> 13:12.272
but I don't want to start
digging through her stuff.

13:12.296 --> 13:14.284
- I'll just get lost in there.
- That's me, then.

13:14.415 --> 13:15.864
I'll go down to the paper,
see what they got.

13:15.888 --> 13:19.089
Thanks, man. A lot of her stuff
is also in boxes in the garage.

13:19.114 --> 13:23.241
I'm on it. And dude, whatever's
happening, whatever this is?

13:23.461 --> 13:25.594
We're going to shut it down.
Count on it.

13:25.898 --> 13:27.969
Hey, Cassidy just told me

13:27.994 --> 13:30.543
that this whole thing has gone
Twilight Zone. I want to help.

13:30.568 --> 13:31.950
- Okay, you're with Dave.
- All right.

13:31.974 --> 13:33.740
C'mon, little buddy.
We're on digging duty.

13:33.954 --> 13:35.599
Okay, bear in mind I have
very weak shoulders,

13:35.623 --> 13:37.090
and I'm mildly allergic to dirt.

13:37.662 --> 13:38.724
Are you okay?

13:38.831 --> 13:40.507
No. You?

13:41.206 --> 13:42.520
Not in the slightest.

13:43.310 --> 13:44.785
Let's go do something about that.

13:48.469 --> 13:50.189
Thanks for helping us out, Mr. Gerard.

13:50.444 --> 13:51.628
No problem.

13:52.025 --> 13:53.435
Our locker's just over here.

13:54.073 --> 13:56.975
I apologize in advance for
our lack of organization.

13:58.110 --> 13:59.516
We never had a large staff,

13:59.541 --> 14:02.910
and time has not been
kind to print media.

14:03.614 --> 14:04.736
You've managed to stay in business

14:04.760 --> 14:06.446
when a lot of small-town papers haven't.

14:07.192 --> 14:09.780
I like to think folks up
here still appreciate facts

14:09.885 --> 14:11.554
over the gossip and innuendo

14:11.579 --> 14:13.468
that passes for news online.

14:14.137 --> 14:15.185
Here we are.

14:17.560 --> 14:20.492
Okay, please tell me there's
a system to all of this.

14:21.096 --> 14:23.406
Older stuff on the bottom, newer on top.

14:23.834 --> 14:24.922
Sorry.

14:25.730 --> 14:29.310
And say hi to Harley
for me, will you?

14:30.116 --> 14:31.450
He probably doesn't remember me,

14:31.475 --> 14:34.778
but Anne Carter was bar none
the best reporter I ever had.

14:35.664 --> 14:37.738
If Harley needs anything,
he just has to ask.

14:38.327 --> 14:40.662
Harley always said if his
mom hadn't gone missing,

14:40.759 --> 14:42.422
she would've cracked the case herself.

14:42.937 --> 14:44.446
Of that, I have no doubt.

14:45.397 --> 14:47.655
- Holler if you need anything else.
- Okay, thank you.

14:49.713 --> 14:53.309
Well, these boxes aren't
going to search themselves.

14:53.334 --> 14:54.629
Yeah, okay.

14:56.501 --> 14:57.903
I'm gonna get a coffee.

14:59.843 --> 15:01.108
Of course.

15:04.444 --> 15:07.780
Okay, the first five victims
all fit the same profile.

15:07.905 --> 15:09.873
Right? No kids, single.

15:09.991 --> 15:13.185
Dark hair, similar glasses. All stabbed.

15:13.219 --> 15:15.449
All taken from their homes
and found in the woods.

15:15.474 --> 15:17.403
All that changed with Lindy McLoud.

15:22.059 --> 15:24.419
- You okay?
- Yeah, thank you.

15:25.090 --> 15:26.598
Your mother didn't fit the pattern.

15:26.633 --> 15:28.294
And neither did Donna Sanchez.

15:28.635 --> 15:30.605
The police didn't find
any personal connection

15:30.630 --> 15:33.038
between Tanner Ellison
and the first five women.

15:33.239 --> 15:35.168
No connection with your mom, either.

15:35.293 --> 15:37.352
But he knew Donna Sanchez.
They were neighbours.

15:37.543 --> 15:39.154
He didn't even bother
hiding their bodies.

15:39.178 --> 15:40.484
Just dumped them in the woods.

15:41.527 --> 15:44.149
Except for my mother's body,
which was never found.

15:45.347 --> 15:48.296
We scoured the area, son.
Night and day for over two weeks.

15:48.321 --> 15:50.556
The Chief had to tell us to
go home to get some sleep.

15:50.912 --> 15:51.927
I know.

15:52.082 --> 15:53.323
We read it in the files.

15:53.677 --> 15:56.839
But it was three 12-year-old
kids who went into the sewers

15:56.864 --> 15:58.594
and came out with the murder weapon.

16:00.938 --> 16:02.874
We went through all the old case files.

16:02.899 --> 16:04.913
Tanner Ellison was the classic loner.

16:04.938 --> 16:07.246
No friends, no girlfriend.
Working parents.

16:07.271 --> 16:08.831
Survived by his brother, Aaron Ellison.

16:09.029 --> 16:11.420
- Who is still in town.
- It's worth a revisit.

16:14.180 --> 16:16.750
So, what changed after Lindy McLoud?

16:17.195 --> 16:18.914
Your gut telling you something, Carter?

16:18.939 --> 16:21.017
- It's trying to.
- Well, keep listening,

16:21.741 --> 16:23.396
because we didn't find any usable prints

16:23.421 --> 16:24.820
on that letter your Hollywood buddy got.

16:24.844 --> 16:26.699
Or on the ring. Just hers and yours.

16:27.067 --> 16:28.355
Okay, thank you.

16:31.996 --> 16:33.761
It's weird having him be so nice.

16:34.967 --> 16:37.035
You wanna go talk to Aaron Ellison?

16:37.433 --> 16:38.850
- I do.
- Let's do it.

16:45.503 --> 16:47.234
Hey, could have been worse.

16:48.320 --> 16:50.234
These could have been in
the last box we looked.

16:50.259 --> 16:52.715
Yeah, third-last box is so much better.

16:54.528 --> 16:56.821
Hey, were you... were you scared?

16:57.153 --> 16:58.554
You know, back then?

16:59.304 --> 17:02.015
What? When we were creeping
around the spooky sewers

17:02.040 --> 17:04.224
looking for a murder weapon
with a killer on the loose?

17:04.481 --> 17:07.208
And I had just discovered Stephen King?
What do you think?

17:09.661 --> 17:11.869
Like, how well did you know Mrs. Carter?

17:13.162 --> 17:16.135
Man, Sam and I,
we slept over almost a whole summer

17:16.407 --> 17:18.790
just because she was reading
"Lord of the Rings" to Harley.

17:19.903 --> 17:22.637
The next day, we'd run around
the forest acting it out.

17:23.742 --> 17:25.316
You were Samwise Gamgee?

17:25.845 --> 17:28.820
Legolas, thank you very much.
Don't stereotype.

17:28.845 --> 17:30.722
- Wow.
- But Anne?

17:31.724 --> 17:33.324
Man, Anne was just cool.

17:34.238 --> 17:37.092
Okay, you had a crush
on her, obviously.

17:37.744 --> 17:40.112
Okay, I'm gonna punch
you for that later.

17:40.967 --> 17:42.146
But this is interesting.

17:42.818 --> 17:43.834
What?

17:43.859 --> 17:47.466
It's a newspaper article about
the last victim. Donna Sanchez.

17:47.940 --> 17:50.366
That's Tanner Ellison's brother, Aaron.

17:54.132 --> 17:55.526
I'm sending this to Harley.

17:58.235 --> 17:59.320
All right, guys.

17:59.345 --> 18:02.280
Come on, let's see one
more good lap, okay?

18:04.185 --> 18:06.106
We're just trying to get
some insight from you

18:06.131 --> 18:07.851
about who may have wanted
your brother dead.

18:08.233 --> 18:09.285
Hundreds of people.

18:09.907 --> 18:13.097
Start with the families of all
the women he supposedly killed.

18:13.984 --> 18:15.944
They're all stirred up
again because of this book.

18:16.235 --> 18:17.515
Yeah, we're looking into that.

18:17.800 --> 18:18.984
Charlotte Khyber.

18:19.256 --> 18:21.648
The woman who wrote this book,
"A Darkness In Bishop",

18:21.768 --> 18:23.180
you know that she was coming to town?

18:23.204 --> 18:24.654
We had heard that, yeah.

18:25.023 --> 18:26.372
She had the nerve to invite me

18:26.397 --> 18:28.164
to this book signing she's going to do.

18:28.257 --> 18:29.891
Well, you were interviewed for the book.

18:30.449 --> 18:31.897
She twisted all my words.

18:32.418 --> 18:34.131
Made it seem like I
never loved my brother.

18:34.156 --> 18:36.324
She turned him into a monster.

18:36.622 --> 18:38.990
Your brother confessed
to murdering seven women.

18:39.164 --> 18:40.503
I know. I know!

18:43.629 --> 18:45.362
Do you have any idea what it's like

18:45.387 --> 18:48.105
to have a sibling you grew up with,
that you love,

18:48.251 --> 18:51.053
slowly change into someone you
don't even recognize anymore?

18:51.470 --> 18:52.963
That has to be difficult for you.

18:53.728 --> 18:55.642
I read an article that
said that your show

18:55.667 --> 18:58.158
was going to turn my brother
into the next Hannibal Lecter.

18:58.377 --> 19:00.144
Again, that can't be easy.

19:00.179 --> 19:02.766
Says a man who's getting
rich off another man's story.

19:02.869 --> 19:03.913
Hey...

19:04.178 --> 19:07.952
Your brother's "story"
ended the stories of seven women.

19:07.977 --> 19:10.569
So, before you say one more
"boo-hoo, poor me" thing,

19:10.795 --> 19:13.525
remember that you are talking
to two people who lost a woman

19:13.550 --> 19:14.580
that they loved deeply

19:14.605 --> 19:17.407
because your brother chose
to tell the story that he did.

19:28.340 --> 19:31.159
How well did you know Donna Sanchez?

19:32.612 --> 19:34.707
Donna Sanchez, your
brother's last victim.

19:35.238 --> 19:38.613
She went to my high school,
I-I really didn't know her.

19:39.084 --> 19:41.287
Well, the badminton club
didn't socialize much,

19:41.312 --> 19:43.279
because this is you and
Donna Sanchez, right?

19:47.089 --> 19:49.888
25 years ago someone killed my mother.

19:49.913 --> 19:51.948
I do not think it was your brother.

19:51.973 --> 19:53.924
I think your brother
killed exactly one person,

19:54.700 --> 19:56.169
and that was Donna Sanchez.

19:58.604 --> 20:01.209
Maybe we should continue
this discussion downtown.

20:06.561 --> 20:09.271
I was kind of in love
with Donna Sanchez,

20:10.198 --> 20:11.911
but then, she shot me down hard

20:11.936 --> 20:13.107
in front of a bunch of my friends.

20:13.131 --> 20:16.950
So, I told my brother,
and he said he'd show her.

20:17.456 --> 20:18.598
I honestly...

20:20.067 --> 20:21.887
I honestly thought
he'd do something dumb

20:21.912 --> 20:24.457
like slash her tires or
break a window or something.

20:25.460 --> 20:26.475
Or something.

20:26.792 --> 20:29.725
He came home one night and
said he'd taken care of it.

20:29.968 --> 20:31.074
He...

20:31.937 --> 20:33.253
He was covered in blood.

20:33.939 --> 20:35.305
Then...

20:37.904 --> 20:39.485
you know the rest.

20:40.586 --> 20:42.305
Why didn't you tell the police?

20:42.648 --> 20:44.086
I was 17.

20:44.772 --> 20:46.626
I felt sure I'd go to jail, too.

20:47.165 --> 20:50.121
Why did Tanner confess to
all those other killings?

20:50.809 --> 20:52.520
My brother had no friends.

20:52.639 --> 20:55.708
He-he just couldn't connect.

20:56.753 --> 20:58.807
All of a sudden, people were
paying attention to him,

20:58.831 --> 21:00.632
actually wanting to talk to him.

21:02.186 --> 21:04.302
The first time you see
yourself in the newspaper,

21:04.633 --> 21:05.842
it's intoxicating.

21:05.974 --> 21:08.742
You'll say or do anything
to keep that going.

21:09.198 --> 21:12.795
So, yes, he said he
killed all those women

21:12.820 --> 21:14.551
and he'd go to jail for
the rest of his life,

21:14.575 --> 21:16.254
but at least he was somebody.

21:16.873 --> 21:18.407
I'm so sorry.

21:19.584 --> 21:21.631
We're going to need you
to make a full statement.

21:22.020 --> 21:24.922
Rafalski, this is Aaron Ellison.

21:24.957 --> 21:26.330
He wants to make a statement.

21:26.385 --> 21:28.080
- I'll be right in.
- Yeah.

21:56.750 --> 21:58.688
Hold it. I'm still
playing catch-up here...

21:58.970 --> 22:00.521
We caught the wrong guy?

22:01.599 --> 22:04.138
He for sure killed Donna Sanchez,
but that may be it.

22:04.163 --> 22:06.656
Wait, so, whoever killed Harley's
mother might still out there?

22:06.811 --> 22:09.691
Okay, we have to stay focused
on what is happening right now.

22:09.716 --> 22:11.996
Who killed Tanner? Who sent the ring?

22:12.050 --> 22:13.425
Who is trying to play us?

22:13.660 --> 22:15.322
But it's all sounding
like the same case.

22:15.481 --> 22:17.517
He says he never stopped the killings.

22:17.806 --> 22:19.810
Bishop is a small place, Harley.

22:19.835 --> 22:22.146
We don't have much in the
way of cold murder cases.

22:23.589 --> 22:25.052
Maybe he just got smarter.

22:33.505 --> 22:36.025
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
I think I got another one.

22:36.208 --> 22:37.228
Gimme.

22:39.442 --> 22:42.042
Okay, here we go, August 2011.

22:42.067 --> 22:43.685
Disappeared after running
up massive debt.

22:43.709 --> 22:45.732
Friends say she talked all
the time about skipping out.

22:45.756 --> 22:46.911
Just walking away.

22:48.219 --> 22:49.219
All right.

22:49.717 --> 22:51.451
July, 1994.

22:51.476 --> 22:53.577
Went missing hiking. Never found.

22:53.676 --> 22:55.416
October, 2001.

22:55.441 --> 22:57.744
Her clothes were found neatly
folded by the Parish Bridge.

22:57.885 --> 22:59.063
Presumed suicide.

22:59.097 --> 23:01.298
Every single one of these
women had a plausible reason

23:01.333 --> 23:02.801
as to why they would just disappear.

23:02.826 --> 23:04.407
And these are just the
ones that were reported.

23:04.431 --> 23:05.632
There were probably others.

23:05.705 --> 23:06.996
He never stopped.

23:08.215 --> 23:09.400
I don't know what to say.

23:09.425 --> 23:11.706
We thought Tanner Ellison did it,
which is why we stopped looking,

23:11.730 --> 23:13.476
which is exactly what
the real killer wanted.

23:13.500 --> 23:16.322
Well, he took advantage of Tanner
Ellison's confession to lay low.

23:16.593 --> 23:18.619
We have to get the
profiler up from Toronto.

23:18.644 --> 23:20.197
I don't like him, but he's good.

23:20.222 --> 23:22.041
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You know what?

23:22.283 --> 23:24.630
We have an expert way closer than that.

23:38.537 --> 23:39.782
You know I'm a TV writer.

23:40.238 --> 23:41.409
We're aware, yeah.

23:41.760 --> 23:43.291
You're better than a profiler.

23:43.464 --> 23:45.455
You write the words the profilers say.

23:45.845 --> 23:47.850
And you won a Peabody!

23:48.325 --> 23:50.287
For my work on TV.

23:51.225 --> 23:52.310
In fiction.

23:53.514 --> 23:56.070
I've learned, slowly and
definitely the hard way,

23:56.095 --> 23:59.663
that not all TV wisdom is foolish.

24:04.077 --> 24:05.196
What's in it for me?

24:08.448 --> 24:10.528
I will give you a definitive
answer on "Call Carter".

24:10.911 --> 24:13.012
No more dancing around,
no more stringing along.

24:13.622 --> 24:15.336
But not necessarily a yes.

24:15.711 --> 24:16.945
A definitive answer.

24:21.899 --> 24:24.741
Well, he has a type, but you know that.

24:27.015 --> 24:29.868
TV likes the idea of
pure evil but in reality,

24:29.893 --> 24:32.165
serial killers are rarely born,
they are made.

24:32.400 --> 24:33.813
Which often starts young,

24:34.734 --> 24:38.762
points to family, trauma, abuse.

24:39.996 --> 24:41.665
Guys, this is ridiculous.

24:41.700 --> 24:43.300
I'm just remembering
stuff from the show.

24:43.566 --> 24:45.566
I have saved a few lives this way.

24:45.591 --> 24:46.862
Yeah, keep going.

24:47.806 --> 24:51.166
Most of these are women of a
certain age, so mommy issues?

24:52.463 --> 24:54.445
Are there breaks? Dormant periods?

24:54.678 --> 24:56.975
We're still digging into it,
but it appears so, yeah.

24:57.089 --> 24:58.690
Classic build and release.

24:58.850 --> 25:00.768
These guys can look perfectly normal

25:00.793 --> 25:02.215
but all the while, it's
building up inside

25:02.239 --> 25:03.940
them until they finally
have to act on it.

25:06.065 --> 25:07.558
Why all this stuff with me?

25:07.765 --> 25:09.299
Why's he playing this game?

25:09.777 --> 25:14.013
Well, killing is often about power.
Power is often about ego.

25:14.465 --> 25:16.587
If this guy has been getting
away with it for a while,

25:16.700 --> 25:18.762
he probably has a pretty
high opinion of himself.

25:18.787 --> 25:20.143
And suddenly, this book comes out,

25:20.167 --> 25:21.638
Tanner Ellison gets all the credit.

25:21.705 --> 25:23.747
It's going to drive
the real killer nuts.

25:24.814 --> 25:25.857
Nuts-er.

25:27.812 --> 25:30.150
Hey, you wanted to know when
that lady got to the hotel.

25:30.175 --> 25:31.539
- Yeah.
- She just arrived.

25:31.860 --> 25:33.446
- Thanks.
- Who's here?

25:33.513 --> 25:34.813
Our last player.

25:34.838 --> 25:36.755
True crime writer Charlotte Khyber.

25:36.963 --> 25:39.164
Feel like getting somebody's
autograph besides your own?

25:39.958 --> 25:42.375
Not really, but let's go.

25:42.462 --> 25:44.890
All right, you should maybe stay here.
You'll be safe.

25:45.034 --> 25:46.868
Make notes, anything you can think of.

25:47.020 --> 25:48.041
And thank you.

26:00.190 --> 26:02.624
Hey, hey, I think I found something.

26:07.943 --> 26:10.255
- What?
- The date.

26:12.623 --> 26:14.716
July 10th, 1993?

26:16.162 --> 26:18.091
That's the day Harley's
mom went missing.

26:31.380 --> 26:32.429
There you go.

26:39.607 --> 26:42.327
Okay, everybody, Charlotte's
just going to take a quick break

26:42.352 --> 26:44.088
but she'll get to everyone shortly.

26:44.618 --> 26:47.653
Harley Carter, right on cue.

26:47.992 --> 26:49.118
What does that mean?

26:49.337 --> 26:51.304
It means that I've been expecting you,

26:51.371 --> 26:53.040
and here you are.

26:53.498 --> 26:55.132
Why were you expecting Harley?

26:55.329 --> 26:58.720
You must be Detective Shaw.
Charlotte Khyber.

26:58.803 --> 27:01.451
Again, why were you expecting Harley?

27:02.091 --> 27:04.044
Tanner Ellison is murdered.

27:04.365 --> 27:08.764
Harley Carter is in town. My book
signing. Harley and I meeting

27:08.789 --> 27:12.091
just seems like the inevitable
next beat in the story.

27:12.116 --> 27:13.317
What story?

27:13.351 --> 27:15.332
And please, drop the whole meta

27:15.357 --> 27:17.958
"I'm an eccentric writer and
the world is my story" crap.

27:18.026 --> 27:20.567
Okay? You've caught me in a very
not-in-the-mood kind of moment.

27:20.658 --> 27:22.798
Sorry. Playing for the fans.

27:23.509 --> 27:24.585
Noted.

27:24.643 --> 27:26.510
What were you hinting
at about the story?

27:26.874 --> 27:30.725
I'm talking about what's
happening here, now.

27:31.014 --> 27:32.353
Tanner Ellison's murder.

27:32.637 --> 27:34.072
Your mother's ring.

27:35.174 --> 27:36.607
How did you know about the ring?

27:36.641 --> 27:39.846
I have my sources.
I am an investigative journalist.

27:39.917 --> 27:42.940
Who, I might add,
just got an extremely attractive offer

27:42.965 --> 27:47.050
from my publisher to do the
sequel to "A Darkness in Bishop".

27:47.785 --> 27:48.941
You know what...

28:03.619 --> 28:06.338
Yeah, okay, all right, thanks. Bye.

28:07.635 --> 28:10.003
Well, Nicole is fairly
certain that it was poison.

28:10.616 --> 28:12.616
Charlotte and Cassidy
are at the station.

28:12.641 --> 28:14.681
They'll be safer there till
we know what's going on.

28:15.131 --> 28:17.341
Okay, that's all good,

28:17.366 --> 28:20.341
but Vijay and I have had what
we call in the business...

28:21.185 --> 28:22.638
a little bit of a breakthrough.

28:22.663 --> 28:24.552
We found a tape in your mom's stuff.

28:24.577 --> 28:26.594
It's from an interview
she conducted when...

28:27.574 --> 28:29.961
Right, um, Harley...

28:31.467 --> 28:32.971
It's from the day she went missing.

28:36.878 --> 28:37.990
Let's hear it.

28:40.970 --> 28:42.627
I'm sorry, Anne, it slipped.

28:42.651 --> 28:44.771
That's okay, don't worry about that.

28:44.927 --> 28:47.093
Just tell me why you're so scared.

28:47.650 --> 28:48.968
It's the killings.

28:49.827 --> 28:51.077
What about them?

28:51.741 --> 28:54.483
It's my son. I think he's involved.

28:54.576 --> 28:55.647
Why do you say that?

28:55.776 --> 28:57.310
I went into his bedroom.

28:57.594 --> 28:59.522
I found a garbage bag.

28:59.862 --> 29:02.475
It had clothes, dirty clothes.

29:03.424 --> 29:05.151
I think there was blood.

29:06.435 --> 29:07.807
Does he know that you found them?

29:07.996 --> 29:09.057
No.

29:09.184 --> 29:11.736
No, I don't think so.
I left everything right where it was.

29:12.229 --> 29:14.751
And... I think it's my fault.

29:15.486 --> 29:17.946
Ms. Carter, when he was little I...

29:18.203 --> 29:19.343
did things.

29:19.675 --> 29:21.906
I was trying to make him a good boy.

29:22.210 --> 29:23.406
He was weak.

29:23.430 --> 29:25.069
I tried to make him strong.

29:26.499 --> 29:28.400
How did you know that she
was going to say that?

29:29.678 --> 29:31.030
Because I was there.

29:36.224 --> 29:38.800
Hey, Harley,
I'm almost finished working here.

29:39.536 --> 29:40.708
Sorry about that.

29:41.331 --> 29:43.766
It's alright. I should go.

29:44.488 --> 29:46.459
Don't say anything to
your son about this.

29:46.676 --> 29:48.778
I'm going to try to make
a few phone calls first.

29:51.441 --> 29:55.051
Okay, do you remember that woman's name?

29:55.318 --> 29:57.817
- And who was her son?
- We weren't introduced.

29:59.021 --> 30:01.489
And you couldn't find part one
of this interview anywhere?

30:01.524 --> 30:02.829
We went through all the boxes.

30:02.976 --> 30:04.643
And then, we went through all the boxes.

30:05.061 --> 30:06.071
It's not there.

30:06.401 --> 30:09.070
I don't know who this woman is or was,

30:09.095 --> 30:10.623
but if I saw her, I would know.

30:12.123 --> 30:14.869
Sam, she had short
dark hair and glasses.

30:16.283 --> 30:17.806
Okay, okay.

30:17.831 --> 30:21.633
So, at the beginning,
she said, "It slipped."

30:21.851 --> 30:24.045
And then, Annie said,
"Don't worry about it."

30:25.209 --> 30:27.267
Do you remember what
they were talking about?

30:30.547 --> 30:31.914
She broke a tea cup.

30:33.077 --> 30:36.391
You want to talk about
tea I made 25 years ago.

30:36.705 --> 30:38.579
She broke one of your tea cups.

30:43.298 --> 30:44.534
I remember!

30:45.152 --> 30:47.284
I don't know her name.

30:48.537 --> 30:49.982
But I have a picture.

30:51.355 --> 30:54.177
- Her.
- Koji used to bowl with her.

30:56.034 --> 30:57.112
What is her name?

30:57.146 --> 31:00.065
How should I know?
Bowling is stupid. Ask Koji.

31:00.270 --> 31:02.271
- Koji!
- Yes?

31:03.388 --> 31:04.496
Have you been listening?

31:04.686 --> 31:05.889
Of course.

31:06.459 --> 31:08.291
What is this woman's name?

31:11.186 --> 31:12.754
Karen something.

31:13.234 --> 31:14.262
Maybe Kaplan.

31:14.297 --> 31:16.718
- Karen Kaplan?
- No, Karen or Kaplan.

31:17.445 --> 31:18.507
No, not Kaplan.

31:18.801 --> 31:22.018
Definitely Karen something.

31:22.596 --> 31:25.690
Karen... something...

31:26.197 --> 31:28.908
- Karen...
- Karen something?

31:30.097 --> 31:32.993
She was on the team,
and then she just dropped out.

31:34.173 --> 31:37.220
Okay, well, Karen something.
That's more than we had an hour ago.

31:37.245 --> 31:38.813
I will send someone
to the bowling alley.

31:38.837 --> 31:40.617
See if we can put a
name to Teacup Karen.

31:48.152 --> 31:50.166
How am I just supposed
to get on an airplane

31:50.191 --> 31:52.404
with all this going on?
It's the right move, Cass.

31:52.429 --> 31:54.522
This psycho wanted you in town
for Charlotte's book signing.

31:54.546 --> 31:55.612
So, we're gonna be proactive

31:55.636 --> 31:57.203
and make sure you're not in town.

31:58.025 --> 31:59.056
You call a cab?

31:59.420 --> 32:01.857
The organizers of Charlotte's
event gave her a limo,

32:01.882 --> 32:03.717
so she's offered me a
lift to the airport.

32:04.130 --> 32:05.427
Come back to L.A. with me.

32:06.193 --> 32:07.560
You're in danger, too.

32:07.687 --> 32:09.751
I can't leave my friends
alone to deal with this,

32:09.785 --> 32:12.302
You're sending me back to L.A.
to handle stuff on my own.

32:12.621 --> 32:14.482
Cass, it's a TV show.

32:15.080 --> 32:16.739
I can't walk away from this.

32:18.527 --> 32:19.587
Go.

32:21.267 --> 32:22.806
I think we can go.

32:23.566 --> 32:25.473
You promised me a definitive answer.

32:27.881 --> 32:30.215
Give me two seconds with
Sam and I'll be right out.

32:30.840 --> 32:31.885
Two seconds.

32:31.935 --> 32:33.510
Thanks again, Detective.

32:33.597 --> 32:34.603
Hey!

32:37.213 --> 32:39.599
- We sure this is the right move?
- Absolutely.

32:39.624 --> 32:41.036
Let's see how the killer likes the game

32:41.060 --> 32:42.888
when we take a couple
of pieces off the board.

32:43.137 --> 32:45.079
- I'm still a piece.
- I know,

32:45.211 --> 32:47.767
and we may have to play the bait card.

32:47.792 --> 32:50.272
But in the meantime, let's just...

32:53.122 --> 32:54.144
Harley!

33:04.443 --> 33:05.486
What?

33:56.176 --> 33:57.231
Help!

34:01.009 --> 34:02.039
Help!

34:12.594 --> 34:14.606
Hey, you okay?

34:15.949 --> 34:17.777
- He's got a gun.
- Yeah, they usually do.

34:18.183 --> 34:19.206
Harley!

34:22.536 --> 34:24.041
Hamilton Gerard.

34:28.425 --> 34:29.784
You ate at my house.

34:30.690 --> 34:32.800
My mother was your friend.

34:34.431 --> 34:35.781
She trusted you.

34:37.994 --> 34:41.761
And this beautiful spot
is my homage to her.

34:42.503 --> 34:44.862
All these years, haven't you
wondered where your mother was?

34:45.433 --> 34:46.867
She always did love the water.

34:48.496 --> 34:50.063
You killed all those women.

34:51.827 --> 34:52.949
And no one even suspected.

34:54.290 --> 34:55.476
Until now.

34:57.409 --> 34:59.730
When my mother came home and
told me she'd spoken to Annie,

35:01.270 --> 35:02.499
I had no choice.

35:03.656 --> 35:05.659
So, now you want to set
the record straight?

35:06.694 --> 35:08.417
As editor of the town paper

35:08.442 --> 35:09.873
where these horrific
events were occurring,

35:09.897 --> 35:11.341
how could I not cover this story?

35:12.744 --> 35:14.050
They'll know it was you.

35:14.335 --> 35:19.327
I'll print nothing that
Harley and his little friends

35:19.352 --> 35:21.876
haven't so conveniently
uncovered in the last few days.

35:23.306 --> 35:25.601
The true story of this unknown killer.

35:26.719 --> 35:29.115
I am not a character in your story.

35:29.140 --> 35:34.097
My mother is certainly not
a character in your story.

35:34.122 --> 35:36.458
You are pathetic, you are second-rate.

35:38.030 --> 35:39.259
And, "come alone"?

35:40.716 --> 35:41.795
I don't think so.

35:43.036 --> 35:45.411
When he was little, I did things.

35:46.130 --> 35:47.157
What?

35:47.814 --> 35:49.181
What things, Hamilton?

35:49.815 --> 35:51.655
'Cause that's what this
is all about, isn't it?

35:52.562 --> 35:54.800
I was trying to make him a good boy.

35:57.288 --> 35:58.574
He was weak.

35:58.607 --> 36:00.675
I tried to make him strong.

36:00.881 --> 36:02.287
She called me weak.

36:03.784 --> 36:04.853
All the time.

36:07.087 --> 36:08.236
She locked me in...

36:11.939 --> 36:13.240
Do I look weak to you?!

36:13.265 --> 36:15.646
Okay, hey, hey. Just stop, just stop...

36:15.671 --> 36:17.295
No!!!

36:21.014 --> 36:22.085
Argh!

36:22.861 --> 36:24.942
Go, Cass! Go, go, go!

36:44.625 --> 36:45.728
Argh!

36:52.374 --> 36:53.559
Argh!

37:03.772 --> 37:05.305
- You all right?
- Yeah.

37:08.358 --> 37:09.850
- Go help Cassidy.
- All right.

37:11.419 --> 37:12.545
Hey, you okay?

37:17.139 --> 37:19.464
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?

37:19.823 --> 37:20.846
Yeah.

37:23.292 --> 37:24.693
Yeah, I mean, I got shot, so...

37:29.273 --> 37:31.671
- Are you okay?
- Am I okay?!

37:32.242 --> 37:34.521
Harley, I've been gagged, tied up

37:34.755 --> 37:36.911
I had a gun pointed at my face,
I saw a woman get stabbed,

37:36.935 --> 37:39.491
and I saw you attack a guy
like you're the frigging Rock!

37:43.751 --> 37:45.325
That was pretty cool, wasn't it?

37:51.892 --> 37:55.816
Well, there's my definitive answer.

37:58.786 --> 38:01.107
If somebody doesn't buy me a drink,
I'm calling the cops!

38:29.864 --> 38:31.327
It's beautiful here.

38:32.616 --> 38:34.467
This was one of her favourite spots.

38:41.676 --> 38:43.300
Do you want me to get the divers out?

38:49.194 --> 38:50.210
No.

38:55.222 --> 38:56.269
Let her sleep.

39:11.410 --> 39:13.487
Okay, okay, you guys are
going to love this!

39:14.630 --> 39:16.755
Right up here, come on, come on!

39:16.904 --> 39:19.712
I hope this surprise isn't a new truck
'cause I like my truck, Harley.

39:19.840 --> 39:22.782
Yeah, and I hope it involves bacon
because I am starving!

39:22.816 --> 39:25.034
I did not ask you guys to get fancied up

39:25.089 --> 39:26.689
for a bacon-related occasion.

39:26.714 --> 39:29.856
I asked you to get all
fancied up for this!

39:31.158 --> 39:33.448
- The Perk and Pawn?
- Yeah!

39:33.861 --> 39:35.261
You always talked about owning

39:35.295 --> 39:38.161
a pawn shop-slash-antiquey type place.

39:38.239 --> 39:40.567
Plus you get to keep
doing your coffee thing.

39:40.864 --> 39:42.899
"Harley Carter, Private Eye"?

39:43.270 --> 39:45.004
What, you didn't want to use "gumshoe"?

39:45.039 --> 39:46.977
I could throw a desk
in there, set up shop.

39:47.001 --> 39:49.075
Harley, I'm gonna need
seed money for this.

39:49.109 --> 39:51.462
No! You know, whatever
money I have left over

39:51.487 --> 39:53.079
after the studio sues me

39:53.104 --> 39:55.677
for not going back to
their show is all yours.

39:56.013 --> 39:57.653
So, I guess it's official.
You're staying?

39:57.958 --> 40:00.886
Hey, I just spent $140
on this sign, okay?

40:00.911 --> 40:02.944
We're not walking away from that.

40:02.969 --> 40:05.696
I think we need to celebrate!

40:05.868 --> 40:07.475
- Yeah.
- Here we go.

40:07.500 --> 40:09.719
Whoa!

40:10.195 --> 40:11.250
Yeah!

40:11.275 --> 40:12.809
Get in there!

40:15.578 --> 40:18.371
- The eye.
- In the eyes. To the Perk and Pawn.

40:18.405 --> 40:19.508
Yes!

40:19.899 --> 40:21.499
But you're not serious

40:21.524 --> 40:22.954
about the private eye thing, right?

40:24.594 --> 40:25.618
Harley?
