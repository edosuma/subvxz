I spent my life travelling
in one direction,

01:01.261 --> 01:04.607
driven by greed,
narcissism, arrogance.

01:04.631 --> 01:07.510
A slight obsession
with Steve McQueen.

01:07.534 --> 01:09.912
You see I'm what I'd call
a professional criminal.

01:09.936 --> 01:12.915
But back in the day you'd
have called me a gangster.

01:12.939 --> 01:14.583
I was blood tied to the second

01:14.607 --> 01:17.553
most powerful crime
family in Los Angeles.

01:17.577 --> 01:22.825
Then in one moment, one
decision changed it all.

01:22.849 --> 01:25.161
See that girl?

01:25.185 --> 01:27.696
That girl happens to be
the daughter of the boss

01:27.720 --> 01:29.932
of our bitter
enemy, the romanos,

01:29.956 --> 01:34.437
the first most powerful
crime family in California.

01:34.461 --> 01:37.373
Talk about star-crossed lovers.

01:37.397 --> 01:39.542
See right now, here?

01:39.566 --> 01:40.843
We're about to cross
that wonderful line

01:40.867 --> 01:43.279
in the sand, that glorious Mark

01:43.303 --> 01:44.947
of no return,

01:44.971 --> 01:49.452
'cause as Steve McQueen
said, "I live for myself

01:49.476 --> 01:52.922
and I answer to nobody."

01:52.946 --> 01:55.458
In 1972 McQueen fell in love

01:55.482 --> 01:57.626
with his co-star
in the "getaway."

01:57.650 --> 02:01.230
At that point she was married
to studio chief Robert Evans.

02:01.254 --> 02:02.665
And when a divorce
was mentioned,

02:02.689 --> 02:04.900
Evans found incriminating
information on McQueen,

02:04.924 --> 02:08.304
the divorce was settled quickly.

02:08.328 --> 02:10.906
But to this day, the nature
of that evidence is unknown.

02:10.930 --> 02:12.575
I mean, what did those
private investigators

02:12.599 --> 02:16.679
dig up on McQueen
that was so volatile?

02:16.703 --> 02:19.381
I want you to think about that,

02:19.405 --> 02:20.983
because what's happening
here is private,

02:21.007 --> 02:23.443
and I don't want you imagining
anything that's going on.

02:26.346 --> 02:28.824
It's the moments of
calm that you remember,

02:28.848 --> 02:30.960
not the actual storm itself.

02:30.984 --> 02:34.230
How quiet, how soulful,

02:34.254 --> 02:36.932
how without pretense she is.

02:36.956 --> 02:39.335
You think of all the magical things
that you want to say to her,

02:39.359 --> 02:41.937
and you go to speak and
nothing comes out,

02:41.961 --> 02:44.473
so you just smile.

02:44.497 --> 02:46.699
She smiles back,
and its all fine.

03:49.929 --> 03:51.431
Fuck.

03:52.932 --> 03:55.711
Fuck you!

04:09.449 --> 04:11.351
The girl's in the
truck, let's go.

04:37.877 --> 04:40.623
I've known you since...
How long now?

04:40.647 --> 04:42.491
Since before you was
in the army, right?

04:42.515 --> 04:43.626
Since you was a kid.

04:43.650 --> 04:46.362
I'm your friend Carl.

04:46.386 --> 04:47.553
I'm your goombah, Gabe.

04:49.122 --> 04:53.535
Gabe, buddy, it shouldn't
be like this, man.

04:53.559 --> 04:54.970
It's undignified.

04:54.994 --> 04:56.438
Man, I know what
you're capable of.

04:56.462 --> 04:57.830
No need to labor the point.

05:00.500 --> 05:01.910
I heard about Sebastian.

05:01.934 --> 05:04.113
You're famous, man.

05:04.137 --> 05:06.749
Yeah, big man on
campus, huh, Gabe?

05:06.773 --> 05:08.717
Just tell him what
you heard, Carl.

05:08.741 --> 05:11.053
What I heard.

05:11.077 --> 05:13.956
Oh, uh, I heard that Sebastian

05:13.980 --> 05:16.525
was in to caterina
for, like, 10 large.

05:16.549 --> 05:19.662
What you did to that poor man,

05:19.686 --> 05:21.563
and how you left him?

05:21.587 --> 05:24.400
It's the stuff a legend, Gabriel.
It really is.

05:24.424 --> 05:25.934
But I think you got a heart,

05:25.958 --> 05:29.405
and I was hoping I could reach
you with my observation.

05:29.429 --> 05:31.874
And I now fully appreciate
my position here,

05:31.898 --> 05:36.545
so I am happy to pay, Gabe,

05:36.569 --> 05:41.550
but I need it to be known that
it wasn't without resistance,

05:41.574 --> 05:44.186
that you broke me, okay?

05:44.210 --> 05:46.379
It's all here. Every bit of it.

05:49.015 --> 05:50.450
He's good.

05:51.451 --> 05:52.685
I'm good.

05:54.654 --> 05:58.424
I don't think you're as bad
as your reputation, Gabe.

06:01.761 --> 06:03.062
But I'm happy to let that be.

06:10.136 --> 06:14.950
Dresses like this were made
to hide some awful pain.

06:14.974 --> 06:18.444
They were designed to disguise
some deep psychological trauma.

06:20.113 --> 06:22.858
I feel like Peggy
cummins in "gun crazy,"

06:22.882 --> 06:25.894
about to embark on an
interstate robbery spree.

06:25.918 --> 06:29.055
You want some of me, copper?
You'll never take me alive.

06:34.927 --> 06:38.173
That's 15 for the wing tips
and 650 for the persols.

06:38.197 --> 06:41.610
650 for a pair of
secondhand shades, Gabe?

06:41.634 --> 06:44.580
650 and tax.

06:44.604 --> 06:46.782
Worth every penny.

06:46.806 --> 06:50.919
714 persol folding sunglasses,

06:50.943 --> 06:53.055
blue glass anti-glare lens,

06:53.079 --> 06:55.448
and the handmade
Italian leather case.

06:57.083 --> 06:58.827
Steve McQueen owned a pair.

06:58.851 --> 07:02.030
Yes, he did.

07:02.054 --> 07:03.766
- Keep the change.
- Thank you.

07:03.790 --> 07:06.668
He also wore m43 roughouts
in "the great escape."

07:06.692 --> 07:08.971
Fashionably tapered
in white chinos,

07:08.995 --> 07:11.874
a button-up woolen cardigan
over a sport shirt.

07:11.898 --> 07:14.743
It's not that I don't have
my own sense of style.

07:14.767 --> 07:16.145
It's just my life seems
that much easier

07:16.169 --> 07:18.013
dressed like the man.

07:18.037 --> 07:19.839
- You ready blondie?
- Mm-hmm.

07:24.143 --> 07:25.621
- Remember, you
can't smile wearing

07:25.633 --> 07:27.122
these glasses. -No,
of course not.

07:27.146 --> 07:29.591
And it's absolutely essential
that we wear them inside,

07:29.615 --> 07:32.995
in the darkened hallways of a shady
apartment building somewhere.

07:33.019 --> 07:35.130
But that will all change
when we get the packet.

07:35.154 --> 07:36.532
- Is that right?
- Mm-hmm.

07:36.556 --> 07:38.658
From whom? The big
bad scary men?

07:40.193 --> 07:42.271
You bought those shades
because Steve McQueen

07:42.295 --> 07:45.274
wore the same make, didn't you?

07:45.298 --> 07:47.943
Why does it always have
to be Steve McQueen?

07:47.967 --> 07:51.647
Don't you think it's a little...
A little weird?

07:51.671 --> 07:54.883
- What is? -How obsessed
you are over some actor?

07:54.907 --> 07:57.286
I mean, I could only name
maybe one of his movies.

07:57.310 --> 08:00.222
- Have you seen "papillon?"
- Sounds riveting.

08:00.246 --> 08:02.658
See that comment right there
just killed any chance

08:02.682 --> 08:04.517
of a long-term
commitment from me.

08:08.054 --> 08:09.932
So when I take her
home and I tell her

08:09.956 --> 08:11.767
I'm gonna call her, I won't,

08:11.791 --> 08:13.135
and that'll be the end of that.

08:13.159 --> 08:15.761
You ready?

08:30.743 --> 08:35.715
Thank you for the
drive, the glasses.

08:38.818 --> 08:41.687
Gabriel, I'll call you.

08:55.401 --> 08:57.079
She used to walk
around my apartment

08:57.103 --> 08:58.847
in these black stockings.

08:58.871 --> 08:59.982
This was always in a t-shirt.

09:00.006 --> 09:03.852
Uh, my god, those legs.

09:03.876 --> 09:06.255
I'd watch her make coffee
just pretending to be asleep,

09:06.279 --> 09:08.657
just watch 'em march,

09:08.681 --> 09:11.150
doing that tiptoe walk that
girls do in their socks.

09:28.834 --> 09:31.914
You see how white her skin is?

09:31.938 --> 09:36.342
The juxtaposition of white
against black on her thigh.

09:38.911 --> 09:41.323
You wanna put your mouth there.

09:41.347 --> 09:43.215
Like a baby on a milk bottle.

10:46.779 --> 10:50.158
Do I respect her?
Yeah, of course.

10:50.182 --> 10:52.194
But if it came down to
keeping or discarding her,

10:52.218 --> 10:54.253
would that wonderful
thigh swing the balance?

10:57.356 --> 10:59.291
Farewell, my love.

11:00.426 --> 11:02.228
Farewell.

11:14.940 --> 11:17.019
There she is,

11:17.043 --> 11:19.354
when McQueen met macgraw
on "the getaway,"

11:19.378 --> 11:22.214
he said she was the kind of woman
you would cheat and then kill for.

11:24.316 --> 11:27.496
I ask myself that question every
time I see a woman I like.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.197
Ah, this kills me.
I should stay,

11:29.221 --> 11:32.868
but in my family, you
don't want to be early,

11:32.892 --> 11:34.572
and you sure as hell
don't want to be late.

11:40.366 --> 11:44.980
See, my family, they're
dangerous people.

11:45.004 --> 11:47.282
And they expect punctuality
from their employees.

11:47.306 --> 11:50.843
And, as such, they demand the
family should set a rigid example.

11:53.079 --> 11:56.992
So I work for my aunt caterina,

11:57.016 --> 12:00.429
and presently that means I
run with the enforcers.

12:00.453 --> 12:02.297
See, she put me on this
detail 'cause she figured

12:02.321 --> 12:05.267
it was a good way to get
me back into the game,

12:05.291 --> 12:07.302
knock away any aspirations
I may have picked up

12:07.326 --> 12:09.161
while in the middle east.

12:11.964 --> 12:15.310
My delightful companions
for the afternoon.

12:15.334 --> 12:17.279
Listen, if you're looking
to correct the imbalance

12:17.303 --> 12:18.447
of justice in the world,

12:18.471 --> 12:20.515
then this is not
your line of work.

12:20.539 --> 12:25.454
It's like the man said,
justice is for one and all,

12:25.478 --> 12:27.279
the same way the ritz hotel is.

13:07.586 --> 13:10.932
Shut up!

13:10.956 --> 13:13.301
We don't wanna be here just as
much as you don't want us here,

13:13.325 --> 13:15.604
but caterina has got a
reputation to uphold.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.139
And if you fail to
acknowledge that,

13:17.163 --> 13:19.608
then where does that
leave us either? Huh?

13:19.632 --> 13:21.543
So listen to me, brother,

13:21.567 --> 13:25.147
before this goes any
further, tell me,

13:25.171 --> 13:26.448
are you willing to pay or not?

13:26.472 --> 13:28.617
'Cause I got some
decisions to make.

13:28.641 --> 13:30.652
Are you sure?

13:30.676 --> 13:34.289
It's in the dresser. Top drawer.

13:34.313 --> 13:35.948
Grocery bag.

13:40.486 --> 13:43.255
You all right? You all right?

13:57.369 --> 13:59.171
That wasn't so hard now, was it?

14:07.379 --> 14:09.215
Looking a little
pale there, Gabriel.

14:13.686 --> 14:16.998
Its been a while, Casper.

14:17.022 --> 14:19.968
I heard you were playing castrati in
a quartet for the Aryan brotherhood.

14:19.992 --> 14:21.927
How's your singing voice, champ?

14:24.063 --> 14:27.309
That's very funny.

14:27.333 --> 14:28.543
Now don't trip over yourself

14:28.567 --> 14:30.145
when you see what I got for you.

14:30.169 --> 14:34.015
A present from up north.

14:34.039 --> 14:36.075
Like them apples, twinkle toes?

14:37.243 --> 14:39.554
Real elephant ivory grips.

14:39.578 --> 14:43.058
Had them fashion me
a tie pin to match.

14:43.082 --> 14:46.728
Pretty tough with the steel
for a mealymouthed faggot.

14:46.752 --> 14:48.630
Want to see what you
are without them, huh?

14:48.654 --> 14:51.600
Big man thinks his war
record is something special,

14:51.624 --> 14:54.502
but what does it mean?

14:54.526 --> 14:55.704
I'll tell you what.

14:55.728 --> 14:57.372
Some phony medals

14:57.396 --> 14:59.398
and a hillbilly heroin habit.

15:03.035 --> 15:04.479
I know you better
than you think.

15:04.503 --> 15:05.638
Don't you forget that.

15:11.010 --> 15:15.390
You know, while you were away
learning to Polish your boots,

15:15.414 --> 15:18.426
I was learning the ropes.

15:18.450 --> 15:20.595
Tony's been grooming me.

15:20.619 --> 15:22.264
Which means one day, you and I,

15:22.288 --> 15:25.124
we'll go head to head, or...

15:27.459 --> 15:30.071
Or what?

15:30.095 --> 15:33.775
Or you learn to play nice
and share your toys.

15:33.799 --> 15:36.044
You can come over, man.
Be like old times.

15:36.068 --> 15:39.514
You just gotta say it.

15:39.538 --> 15:42.474
Just say, "I'm sorry."

15:47.046 --> 15:51.059
You know what the problem is?

15:51.083 --> 15:53.485
You let your ambition outweigh
your ability, Casper.

15:55.287 --> 15:58.533
You'll only ever be
the odd man out.

15:58.557 --> 16:01.293
You won't mean shit as a chief.

16:02.728 --> 16:05.497
You may wish you'd taken
my advice there, sunshine.

16:13.472 --> 16:16.685
My aunt caterina runs
a club downtown.

16:16.709 --> 16:19.154
It's an ugly little place.

16:19.178 --> 16:23.725
From there, she manages at least a
dozen more questionable venues.

16:23.749 --> 16:25.760
Her miniature empire of sleaze

16:25.784 --> 16:27.629
covers everything
from dance clubs

16:27.653 --> 16:30.699
to strip clubs, a
taxi dancing slum,

16:30.723 --> 16:32.567
several section eight
housing facilities,

16:32.591 --> 16:33.759
and a laundry mat.

16:56.315 --> 16:58.326
She takes her percentage
from any pimps, prostitutes,

16:58.350 --> 17:00.195
or drug dealers that
peddle their wares

17:00.219 --> 17:02.163
in these high-class venues.

17:02.187 --> 17:05.532
She inherited the family
business from her pa, gramps.

17:05.557 --> 17:10.105
If I play my cards right, I'm next in
line to reign over this rotten regency.

17:10.128 --> 17:13.775
Gramps was one of the original L.A.
bag men,

17:13.799 --> 17:17.746
an Oakland biker who beat, stole,
and intimidated his way into money,

17:17.770 --> 17:21.348
carving himself a
nice little niche.

17:21.373 --> 17:25.353
And that's where he sat as
ruler and grand inquisitor,

17:25.377 --> 17:27.813
unchallenged for
almost 30 years.

17:34.486 --> 17:36.865
Now age and booze may
have broken him,

17:36.889 --> 17:39.358
but Mark my words, he's still
a formidable presence.

17:41.427 --> 17:43.138
And he's sure as
hell the only person

17:43.162 --> 17:45.364
my aunt caterina is afraid of.

17:59.244 --> 18:00.755
I'm begging you.

18:00.779 --> 18:02.590
He's begging you.

18:02.614 --> 18:04.159
Paulie collects tomorrow.

18:04.183 --> 18:05.693
The payment or your liver?
Your choice.

18:05.717 --> 18:09.898
There she is, queen,
my aunt caterina.

18:09.922 --> 18:11.866
Gabe, Gabriel.

18:11.890 --> 18:13.935
They don't even breathe
without her permission.

18:13.959 --> 18:16.295
Just finishing up here.
You'll drive, okay?

18:20.399 --> 18:22.868
You ever think about
just getting away?

18:27.306 --> 18:28.907
Leaving it all behind?

18:33.445 --> 18:36.791
Happy birthday, dad.

18:36.815 --> 18:38.150
How are they treating you?

18:40.953 --> 18:43.898
I saw a documentary
on sturgis last week.

18:43.922 --> 18:45.858
I thought of you.

18:48.527 --> 18:49.595
What do you want?

18:50.896 --> 18:53.308
It's your birthday.

18:53.332 --> 18:55.334
Goddamn it, I don't
know why you bother.

18:59.838 --> 19:05.386
I'm dealing with this
hell hole on my own,

19:05.410 --> 19:10.225
and I don't need
you to remind me

19:10.249 --> 19:11.860
of my own mortality.

19:11.884 --> 19:15.487
Well, you're here because
we want you to be happy.

19:18.423 --> 19:21.469
And look at the pretty girl
who takes care of you.

19:21.493 --> 19:24.796
You wouldn't want me wiping
your ass, would you?

19:26.565 --> 19:28.600
Are you trying to make
light of my situation?

19:30.035 --> 19:32.514
You ungrateful shit hole.

19:32.538 --> 19:34.382
Dad.

19:34.406 --> 19:35.817
Look at me, caterina.

19:35.841 --> 19:38.686
I feel like shit.

19:38.710 --> 19:42.357
I'm angry all the time.

19:42.381 --> 19:44.216
I miss my legs,

19:46.885 --> 19:48.554
I miss my fists.

19:51.557 --> 19:54.893
I miss my cock. Okay?

19:56.962 --> 19:59.541
Yeah, you know,

19:59.565 --> 20:03.702
I'm thinking, uh, I'm
going to go away.

20:06.638 --> 20:08.516
I won't go quietly.

20:08.540 --> 20:12.711
This is a place for you to
reflect on your past, pa.

20:15.347 --> 20:16.915
The present.

20:21.653 --> 20:23.555
That's all man has, anyway.

20:26.925 --> 20:30.505
See that town out there?

20:30.529 --> 20:31.630
That was my town.

20:35.400 --> 20:40.348
Yeah, it was like
a big ripe whore

20:40.372 --> 20:42.617
that was mine for the taking.

20:42.641 --> 20:44.409
And I took it.

20:47.079 --> 20:52.784
I demanded utter respect.

20:54.786 --> 20:59.367
I'd just nod my head

20:59.391 --> 21:02.461
and I could change a man's life.

21:03.462 --> 21:06.975
The women wanted me.

21:06.999 --> 21:08.433
Your mother.

21:13.972 --> 21:16.842
You got no idea of all
the things I've done.

21:20.579 --> 21:22.481
So don't you talk down to me.

21:24.816 --> 21:26.694
Why do you come
around here anyways?

21:26.718 --> 21:30.031
Just, I don't know,

21:30.055 --> 21:35.703
trying to appease your
guilty consciences?

21:35.727 --> 21:38.030
Make you feel better
about yourselves?

21:39.731 --> 21:42.467
'Cause I don't want
you here, you see?

21:44.670 --> 21:49.684
I don't need you
dredging up the past.

21:49.708 --> 21:52.487
I don't wanna share it with you.

21:52.511 --> 21:54.012
Now fuck off.

22:10.028 --> 22:12.674
Who the fuck are you?

22:12.698 --> 22:15.143
What the fuck are
you doing here?

22:15.167 --> 22:19.471
Nurse! Nurse, I wanna
go back to my room now!

22:34.986 --> 22:38.032
"The magnificent seven" was
supposed to be yul brynner's movie.

22:38.056 --> 22:40.902
I mean, he bought the rights,
he produced, he starred in it.

22:40.926 --> 22:43.562
At one point, he even
considered directing it.

22:46.765 --> 22:48.176
You wanna see some class act,

22:48.200 --> 22:52.013
and I mean unadulterated
scene stealing?

22:52.037 --> 22:55.116
Then watch any frame that
McQueen and brynner share.

22:55.140 --> 22:57.518
I defy you to take
your eyes off of him.

22:57.542 --> 22:59.821
Something I learned from that...

22:59.845 --> 23:01.556
Like, I wanted a bookcase,

23:01.580 --> 23:04.125
and we built a bookcase,
and coffee table,

23:04.149 --> 23:05.560
and all that kind of stuff.

23:05.584 --> 23:08.196
And I just jokingly said,

23:08.220 --> 23:09.731
"we should start a company,

23:09.755 --> 23:11.132
dolenz and daughter's
fine furniture."

23:11.156 --> 23:12.758
And she ran with it.

23:22.801 --> 23:25.613
One of the most
dangerous women I know.

23:25.637 --> 23:28.249
And that show is
the closest thing

23:28.273 --> 23:30.876
she's had to a relationship
since her marriage.

23:35.781 --> 23:39.026
You saw Tyler and
gave him my message?

23:39.050 --> 23:40.261
Yeah.

23:41.953 --> 23:43.989
Take off your glasses.
I wanna see your eyes.

23:48.927 --> 23:51.639
You know the situation
between me and the shark.

23:51.663 --> 23:53.775
You know we're in a war.

23:53.799 --> 23:55.777
At some point we may need
to address Casper, though.

23:55.801 --> 23:57.845
Ugh, Casper.

23:57.869 --> 24:00.281
Watch yourself around him.

24:00.305 --> 24:02.974
He'll do anything
to tear us apart.

24:04.109 --> 24:05.610
I have something for you.

24:09.714 --> 24:14.562
Tony the shark has
a daughter, Eva.

24:14.586 --> 24:18.266
I want you to get to know her.

24:18.290 --> 24:21.702
You know, gently get
comfortable with her.

24:21.726 --> 24:23.004
Yeah, why me?

24:23.028 --> 24:27.275
Paulie knows where she
eats and hangs out.

24:27.299 --> 24:30.669
Just be yourself.
She'll like you.

24:31.703 --> 24:33.138
Do it for me.

24:37.676 --> 24:40.212
Don't forget to turn
off the lights.

25:58.690 --> 26:01.092
♪ Today...

26:05.730 --> 26:09.076
Hi. Hi. Sorry to, uh,
sorry to bother you all.

26:09.100 --> 26:12.213
Um, I can't quite believe
I'm about to say this,

26:12.237 --> 26:14.649
but I've seen you
somewhere before.

26:14.673 --> 26:17.051
- Am I right?
- Uh-huh?

26:17.075 --> 26:19.220
No, I know. Look at them.
Straightaway.

26:19.244 --> 26:21.255
I know it sounds like
a hit-up, right?

26:21.279 --> 26:23.357
It's not. It's
complete sincerity.

26:23.381 --> 26:25.760
I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to be rude.

26:25.784 --> 26:27.161
It's just, we were talking.

26:27.185 --> 26:28.162
With your friends.
I interrupted.

26:28.186 --> 26:29.830
Absolutely. I get it.

26:29.854 --> 26:33.868
Ladies, I apologize, but,
um, give me some slack.

26:33.892 --> 26:36.027
I can tell this is gonna
be a tough crowd.

26:38.363 --> 26:41.909
Gabriel tancredi. Just
give me two minutes.

26:41.933 --> 26:43.411
Let me buy you a cup of coffee,

26:43.435 --> 26:44.946
'cause there's more to
you than meets the eye.

26:44.970 --> 26:47.105
Prove me wrong.

26:50.909 --> 26:52.243
Eva.

26:53.979 --> 26:55.957
Eva Romano.

26:55.981 --> 26:58.960
Miss Romano, it's a
pleasure to meet you.

26:58.984 --> 27:00.294
Ladies, do you mind
if I borrow her

27:00.318 --> 27:01.862
for a couple of minutes?

27:01.886 --> 27:03.965
I promise I'll bring her back.

27:03.989 --> 27:07.134
Thank you for letting
me try my luck, huh?

27:07.158 --> 27:08.960
Be right back.

27:13.164 --> 27:15.743
You seem sweet. Very nice.

27:15.767 --> 27:17.445
Pretty sure of
yourself, aren't you?

27:17.469 --> 27:20.281
Come on, it's a little
endearing, right?

27:20.305 --> 27:24.118
I prefer my friends to
invest in a little humility.

27:24.142 --> 27:26.821
As you should. As you should.

27:26.845 --> 27:27.989
What do you want to drink?

27:28.013 --> 27:30.324
Ice blended green tea.

27:30.348 --> 27:31.959
Hey, George, get
an ice blended...

27:31.983 --> 27:33.995
- Green tea - green tea.

27:34.019 --> 27:36.330
And you know what? Take care
of the girls' tab for me.

27:36.354 --> 27:38.256
Thank you very much.

27:40.058 --> 27:41.369
That was a 50.

27:41.393 --> 27:44.171
Yeah.

27:44.195 --> 27:45.339
Yeah, there's a
saying in the quran

27:45.363 --> 27:47.008
that when you meet a new friend

27:47.032 --> 27:48.843
on the road of life, it's
a blessing from god.

27:48.867 --> 27:50.845
So, I don't know, I guess

27:50.869 --> 27:53.414
I'm just doing my
part in some way.

27:53.438 --> 27:57.351
When did you read the quran?

27:57.375 --> 28:00.287
A long time ago, you know.

28:00.311 --> 28:02.423
For a brief moment, I was in
a middle eastern country,

28:02.447 --> 28:07.862
and, uh, well, I did
nothing to be proud of.

28:07.886 --> 28:10.031
Anyway, I was raised
here by my aunt.

28:10.055 --> 28:12.333
A strong woman,

28:12.357 --> 28:14.335
with a deep and profound
hatred of the army

28:14.359 --> 28:18.039
or any government
organization, in fact.

28:18.063 --> 28:21.509
So, sure enough, at 17,

28:21.533 --> 28:24.412
full of rebellious teen spirit,

28:24.436 --> 28:26.080
I defected, and I joined up.

28:26.104 --> 28:28.115
And that's when you
discovered the quran?

28:28.139 --> 28:32.343
Mm-hmm. Well, there are no
atheists in war, right?

28:33.511 --> 28:35.089
Right.

28:35.113 --> 28:37.224
So I read the Bible first.

28:37.248 --> 28:39.193
Also looked down upon

28:39.217 --> 28:42.029
with distinct disdain
in our household.

28:42.053 --> 28:44.999
And then the quran, and anything
else I could get my hands on.

28:45.023 --> 28:50.037
- Were you injured?
- Mm-hmm.

28:50.061 --> 28:52.230
I got a headache from
reading by flashlight.

28:54.499 --> 28:56.343
So what are you girls
up to tonight, huh?

28:56.367 --> 28:58.312
You destroying the town?
Painting it red?

28:58.336 --> 29:00.915
We are going to catch
a foreign film.

29:00.939 --> 29:02.450
A foreign film, huh?

29:02.474 --> 29:04.418
Wow, you girls got culture.

29:04.442 --> 29:06.187
Visconti's "il gattopardo."

29:06.211 --> 29:10.291
"The leopard," I know it well.
It's a beautiful one.

29:10.315 --> 29:14.428
- Yeah, yeah.
- I like the classics,

29:14.452 --> 29:18.099
but I have a real love, and
I mean an aching fondness

29:18.123 --> 29:20.000
for the Japanese films
of the '60s and '70s.

29:20.024 --> 29:21.168
I don't know if you know them.

29:21.192 --> 29:22.603
Akira kurosawa?

29:22.627 --> 29:26.941
Wow. That was a nice pull.

29:26.965 --> 29:28.609
But, no. No, my uh,

29:28.633 --> 29:32.279
my go-to desert island movies
are the yakuza pictures

29:32.303 --> 29:33.380
of kinji fukasaku.

29:33.404 --> 29:35.382
- You know him?
- No.

29:35.406 --> 29:38.252
Ah, maybe you're smarter
than I thought.

29:38.276 --> 29:42.323
I have said nothing for you
to base that conclusion on.

29:42.347 --> 29:44.082
You know, you're right.
I take it all back.

29:45.984 --> 29:48.329
So, listen, you've managed
to make me talk about myself

29:48.353 --> 29:52.466
without divulging a single
personal detail about you.

29:52.490 --> 29:55.560
You know how impressive that is?
Hmm?

29:58.329 --> 29:59.607
So is it worth me asking

29:59.631 --> 30:01.166
to extend our two
minutes together?

30:04.936 --> 30:06.180
We have class.

30:06.204 --> 30:07.581
Oh, you've got a thing, huh?

30:07.605 --> 30:09.216
- We have to go.
- Yeah.

30:09.240 --> 30:11.218
Yeah.

30:11.242 --> 30:15.613
Well, Eva Romano,
it was a pleasure.

30:17.549 --> 30:19.927
I don't normally do this.

30:19.951 --> 30:24.165
- But, uh...
- Uh-oh.

30:24.189 --> 30:26.333
I'm getting the digits, huh?

30:26.357 --> 30:28.359
Here's my number.

30:34.933 --> 30:36.868
- Call me, okay?
- You got it.

30:39.237 --> 30:40.872
Hey.

31:28.686 --> 31:32.290
You upset me with that
odd man out crap.

31:34.425 --> 31:36.594
Then I apologize.

31:37.595 --> 31:39.230
How's your mother?

31:42.133 --> 31:43.711
Getting old.

31:43.735 --> 31:46.247
She worries.

31:46.271 --> 31:48.249
How's the old man?

31:48.273 --> 31:50.517
He's from a different
era, you know?

31:50.541 --> 31:52.419
I mean, they hit
first, carried a gun,

31:52.443 --> 31:54.688
paid off the cops.

31:54.712 --> 31:56.557
It's easy to remember
how your life was

31:56.581 --> 31:59.493
when all your friends
are dead or in prison.

31:59.517 --> 32:02.263
His time's over. He knows it.

32:02.287 --> 32:04.431
You think the game has
really changed that much?

32:04.455 --> 32:07.268
If you're looking to make
a career out of it, yeah.

32:07.292 --> 32:10.228
I heard his mind was
starting to shut down.

32:11.462 --> 32:14.541
Not at all. Sharp as a tack.

32:14.565 --> 32:16.634
I hope I have his spark
when I'm that age.

32:19.137 --> 32:20.371
Hmm.

32:25.743 --> 32:30.315
So did you think about it?
About coming over?

32:32.750 --> 32:35.629
We'll let caterina run her club.

32:35.653 --> 32:37.398
She just has to back
away from the vice.

32:37.422 --> 32:40.334
It's not the time, buddy.

32:40.358 --> 32:42.269
I know why you're
stalling, Gabriel.

32:42.293 --> 32:46.473
But Tony?

32:46.497 --> 32:49.000
Tony might see your
indecision as a decision.

32:55.606 --> 32:58.485
You're an outcast, Casper.

32:58.509 --> 33:02.222
A little Korean boy who tried
to impress the yakuza.

33:02.246 --> 33:03.490
But when your first
hit went off wrong,

33:03.514 --> 33:05.793
remember what happened?

33:05.817 --> 33:08.362
I do.

33:08.386 --> 33:11.832
You ran, right?

33:11.856 --> 33:15.436
And whether it was the FBI or the 893
who were after you, we'll never know.

33:15.460 --> 33:20.274
But what we do know
is that you ran,

33:20.298 --> 33:21.775
and you haven't stopped running.

33:21.799 --> 33:23.534
You're trying to provoke me.

33:25.870 --> 33:29.407
I'm not judging you, brother.
I've seen what war does.

33:30.708 --> 33:32.353
Every fiber of your
soul screaming

33:32.377 --> 33:33.354
that you're in the wrong place,

33:33.378 --> 33:34.655
to get out, get down,

33:34.679 --> 33:36.824
just get the fuck away.

33:36.848 --> 33:40.218
Just stripped to the most
basic of human reactions.

33:42.653 --> 33:45.093
But you know what the difference
between you and I is, though?

33:47.658 --> 33:49.260
I didn't run.

33:53.731 --> 33:56.110
You're talking about things
you don't understand.

33:56.134 --> 33:58.379
The yakuza are a formidably

33:58.403 --> 34:00.547
culturally oriented
society, right?

34:00.571 --> 34:02.616
I mean, they must have
made it painfully clear

34:02.640 --> 34:04.284
that you were beneath
them, not being Japanese.

34:04.308 --> 34:07.121
And now you got Tony.

34:07.145 --> 34:10.324
I mean, he gets more
talent as he ages,

34:10.348 --> 34:11.725
and he's never gonna look at you

34:11.748 --> 34:14.261
as anything other
than a curiosity

34:14.284 --> 34:15.753
within that firm.

34:18.589 --> 34:23.194
- I see.
- Hmm. Do you?

34:24.429 --> 34:25.906
See, you've devoted your life

34:25.929 --> 34:28.208
to advancing in two subcultures

34:28.232 --> 34:29.877
that really have no
interest in seeing you

34:29.900 --> 34:32.603
as anything other than a
glorified errand boy.

34:34.572 --> 34:35.873
A professional bitch.

34:40.710 --> 34:41.879
Right.

34:45.283 --> 34:48.119
He wants you on board.
He won't ask again.

34:49.786 --> 34:51.789
And if you're not with
us, well, then...

34:53.623 --> 34:55.793
Another time.

34:59.730 --> 35:02.609
I take her out a
couple more times.

35:02.633 --> 35:03.944
It always comes back to the car.

35:03.968 --> 35:07.614
I like this car.

35:07.638 --> 35:10.551
It has a stately elegance to it.

35:10.575 --> 35:12.586
A carryover from
an age of beauty,

35:12.610 --> 35:15.923
the social upheaval of the '60s,

35:15.947 --> 35:18.926
the right movies,
the best music.

35:18.950 --> 35:20.818
The best music, huh?

35:23.321 --> 35:26.800
An era of political fire at war.

35:26.824 --> 35:28.802
No one will ever look
back on our generation

35:28.826 --> 35:32.239
and say this is when America
lost her innocence.

35:32.263 --> 35:33.774
Eh, who's to judge
when all the judges

35:33.798 --> 35:35.333
have been dragged
before the bar?

35:36.334 --> 35:38.846
I don't understand.

35:38.870 --> 35:42.483
Well, with no conventional way
of thinking to rebel against,

35:42.507 --> 35:44.485
I mean, what do you...
What do you rebel against?

35:44.509 --> 35:47.845
You're simplifying it, but I
understand what you mean.

35:50.681 --> 35:53.427
It's funny, normally
I'd argue, but...

35:53.451 --> 35:55.529
But?

35:55.553 --> 35:59.266
For some reason, I find
myself agreeing with you.

35:59.290 --> 36:02.836
- That's no fun.
- No.

36:02.860 --> 36:04.738
I mean, I can stop
speaking, if you want.

36:04.762 --> 36:09.667
No, that's okay. I think
that's the answer.

36:15.373 --> 36:18.242
You're not gonna disappoint
me, are you, Gabe?

36:21.379 --> 36:25.483
Once I'm past this
colorful exterior?

36:28.019 --> 36:29.720
I'm nothing special.

36:31.889 --> 36:34.225
That's the only thing I believe.

36:57.582 --> 37:00.294
♪ Give me a lion roar

37:00.318 --> 37:02.029
♪ give me some claws

37:02.053 --> 37:05.032
♪ so I can scratch
you out my life ♪

37:05.056 --> 37:09.903
♪ rip you to shreds,
then eat you alive ♪

37:09.927 --> 37:12.005
♪ digest you, feel you inside ♪

37:12.029 --> 37:14.975
I just wish someone
would try and hurt you,

37:14.999 --> 37:16.643
just so that I could
kill them for you.

37:16.667 --> 37:19.479
That is the nicest thing
anyone has ever said to me.

37:21.639 --> 37:24.751
♪ No, I'm not gonna
regurgitate ♪

37:24.775 --> 37:27.487
♪ or alleviate myself again

37:27.511 --> 37:30.591
♪ just know

37:30.615 --> 37:32.426

37:32.450 --> 37:34.661

your delicious hair ♪

37:34.685 --> 37:37.388
♪ I'm not gonna
choke, you're over ♪

37:39.857 --> 37:43.437
I can't explain it, but
it feels different.

37:43.461 --> 37:45.772
Unfortunately, I think I may
loose my cool with this one.

37:55.106 --> 37:59.453
♪ Give me a lion roar

37:59.477 --> 38:04.825
♪ I said, give me a lion roar ♪

38:12.123 --> 38:14.659

38:26.804 --> 38:28.339
Tempus fugit.

38:31.542 --> 38:32.843
Time flies.

38:44.555 --> 38:45.690
I'm hungry.

38:47.692 --> 38:48.859
Me, too.

39:05.543 --> 39:09.523
You know, people look at you
like they should know you.

39:09.547 --> 39:11.525
- They do, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

39:11.549 --> 39:14.018
Maybe it's 'cause I'm with you.

39:17.822 --> 39:19.800
What do you do for
a living, Gabe?

39:19.824 --> 39:21.902
Legal and accounting.

39:21.926 --> 39:24.705
Supervision mostly.

39:24.729 --> 39:26.206
The only people I
know that keep cash

39:26.230 --> 39:28.542
around like yours are
gangsters and drug dealers.

39:28.566 --> 39:31.111
Well, I'll keep that in mind.

39:31.135 --> 39:33.180
I'd hate to be confused
for a drug dealer.

39:33.204 --> 39:35.982
Don't dance around me, Gabe.

39:36.006 --> 39:38.776
I have gangsters in my family.
I know who they are.

39:40.845 --> 39:43.757
I watched them destroy
my mother's looks,

39:43.781 --> 39:46.684
her sanity, her self worth.

39:49.754 --> 39:50.931
I'm not going down that road.

39:50.955 --> 39:54.534
You shouldn't.

39:54.558 --> 39:56.069
Would it help if I told you

39:56.093 --> 39:59.206
that the dancing was an effect

39:59.230 --> 40:02.099
of me being slightly
nervous around you?

40:03.934 --> 40:05.545
Nervous of the fact
that I don't think

40:05.569 --> 40:06.613
I've felt this way

40:06.637 --> 40:08.606
about anyone in a long time.

40:22.686 --> 40:25.065
Steve did two films
with Sam peckinpah,

40:25.089 --> 40:27.000
the Walter hill
scripted "the getaway"

40:27.024 --> 40:29.636
and the character study
"junior bonner."

40:29.660 --> 40:31.738
On its release, it
disappointed fans

40:31.762 --> 40:32.773
of both McQueen and peckinpah.

40:32.797 --> 40:34.775
But if you watch it,

40:34.799 --> 40:37.802
you see Steve at his most
natural, humanistic.

40:39.637 --> 40:41.114
Bloody Sam got his start

40:41.138 --> 40:44.017
working for b-movie
director Don Siegel.

40:44.041 --> 40:46.887
Siegel and McQueen had worked
together years before,

40:46.911 --> 40:48.555
then he went on to
direct such classics

40:48.579 --> 40:51.057
as "dirty Harry" and
"escape from Alcatraz,"

40:51.081 --> 40:53.627
defying that old Hollywood rule

40:53.651 --> 40:57.230
that a director's pictures
deteriorate as he ages.

40:57.254 --> 41:00.934
He became a legend after
shooting "the wild bunch."

41:00.958 --> 41:04.938
Oh, he already had a
reputation for bad behavior.

41:04.962 --> 41:07.240
Once he showed his
appreciation for a movie

41:07.264 --> 41:09.910
by pissing on a theater
screen during a preview.

41:09.934 --> 41:11.278
She's been asking for you, Gabe.

41:11.302 --> 41:13.113
Okay, sweetheart.

41:13.137 --> 41:15.048
So John Wayne may have
had hawks and Ford

41:15.072 --> 41:16.817
as his twin fathers,

41:16.841 --> 41:18.618
but I think McQueen more
than made up for it

41:18.642 --> 41:20.402
with the influence
peckinpah had on his work.

41:44.902 --> 41:47.180
Poor Willie.

41:47.204 --> 41:50.183
He's been with us since
he was underage.

41:50.207 --> 41:53.186
The two of them go down to
Marcelo's tacos on 6th.

41:53.210 --> 41:54.921
They get followed.
They get shot.

41:54.945 --> 41:57.624
Tony the fucking shark.
He's laughing at me, Gabe.

41:57.648 --> 41:59.125
Well, how do you know it's him?

41:59.149 --> 42:03.630
One of the boys saw
Casper here last night.

42:03.654 --> 42:06.633
He asked him to leave, he did,

42:06.657 --> 42:10.036
but he pointed his finger like a gun...
a threat.

42:10.060 --> 42:11.905
All right, I'll have David
call Michael at the foundry.

42:11.929 --> 42:14.341
We'll get rid of the bodies.

42:14.365 --> 42:15.709
Right now I gotta get some air.

42:15.733 --> 42:17.644
I need to think.

42:17.668 --> 42:20.213
You know, Casper could
be working on his own.

42:20.237 --> 42:22.883
He benefits from a war.
Romano doesn't.

42:22.907 --> 42:24.251
Remember that.

42:24.275 --> 42:26.720
And the girl?

42:26.744 --> 42:28.345
I'm working on it.

43:00.945 --> 43:02.279
This is where he went down.

43:04.114 --> 43:06.092
Your other boy was hit
a little further away.

43:06.116 --> 43:08.986
Still strong enough to
come back for his brother.

43:11.221 --> 43:14.200
Middle of the day, huh?

43:14.224 --> 43:17.804
Everyone vanished when
the shooting started.

43:17.828 --> 43:21.141
Your man's bleeding
out as he walks,

43:21.165 --> 43:22.809
carrying his friend
over his shoulder.

43:22.833 --> 43:25.779
Had they stayed put,

43:25.803 --> 43:26.880
probably would have survived.

43:26.904 --> 43:28.915
Any ideas?

43:28.939 --> 43:31.851
He came and went. Habeas corpus.

43:31.875 --> 43:33.820
You see the shooter?

43:33.844 --> 43:35.155
I don't like being
shot at, Gabe.

43:35.179 --> 43:37.123
I don't like it at all.

43:37.147 --> 43:38.425
I could have had that life.

43:38.449 --> 43:40.026
Could have rolled with it

43:40.050 --> 43:42.128
and made a lot more money
than frying tacos.

43:42.152 --> 43:43.830
Don't think I don't
dream about it.

43:43.854 --> 43:46.399
The path chooses you, Marcelo.

43:46.423 --> 43:49.803
I'll say this, Gabe.
There was only one gun.

43:49.827 --> 43:52.005
How do you know that?

43:52.029 --> 43:53.907
No car. No yelling.

43:53.931 --> 43:55.375
He runs afterwards.

43:55.399 --> 43:58.812
It was a big gun. A Magnum.

43:58.836 --> 44:00.671
You could tell by the sound.

44:02.006 --> 44:04.150
You saw him, didn't you?

44:04.174 --> 44:06.286
I seen him run, that's all.

44:06.310 --> 44:08.345
You saw him.

44:10.914 --> 44:11.915
Go ahead, take it.

44:18.055 --> 44:19.189
Son of a...

44:54.191 --> 44:55.793
Oh!

45:16.914 --> 45:18.248
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

45:41.038 --> 45:45.185
She's finished, Gabriel.
Can't you see that?

45:45.209 --> 45:48.188
You gonna use it or
just keep flashing it?

45:48.212 --> 45:49.213
'Cause I'm right here.

47:01.685 --> 47:04.164
Why did he run?

47:04.188 --> 47:07.333
The same reason I ran after him.

47:07.357 --> 47:09.002
We both knew he couldn't
look me in the eye

47:09.026 --> 47:11.461
and lie about killing
caterina's two boys.

47:30.214 --> 47:32.025
A drive-by?

47:32.049 --> 47:34.093
A fucking drive-by shooting?

47:34.117 --> 47:36.696
We lost two of our
own last night.

47:36.720 --> 47:41.100
Now I've carried you for the
last dozen years or so.

47:41.124 --> 47:42.569
You've made money.

47:42.593 --> 47:46.539
Now we are in a situation
that has to be handled

47:46.563 --> 47:48.641
or we are going to be in a long

47:48.665 --> 47:51.044
protracted war on all fronts.

47:51.068 --> 47:52.545
It's Casper, not Romano.

47:52.569 --> 47:54.547
He's trying to provoke you.

47:54.571 --> 47:56.216
Just let me deal with him.

47:56.240 --> 47:59.519
It's too late for that, Gabe.

47:59.543 --> 48:02.422
Tony the shark. Paulie?

48:02.446 --> 48:03.957
Tony the shark's ex-wife

48:03.981 --> 48:06.359
lives in Barbados or something.

48:06.383 --> 48:09.028
His kid is in town. Film school.

48:09.052 --> 48:11.231
We have at her
tomorrow after class.

48:11.255 --> 48:13.466
Kidnapping his daughter? That's
hitting him below the belt.

48:13.490 --> 48:16.269
Gabe's been keeping
his eye on the girl,

48:16.293 --> 48:17.503
so he can lead us right to her.

48:17.527 --> 48:20.063
Tomorrow night, Gabe.

48:24.201 --> 48:26.279
Wait up. Wait.

48:26.303 --> 48:28.581
Nothing in life is random, Gabe.

48:28.605 --> 48:30.250
Tony and I were raised together

48:30.274 --> 48:33.186
to slowly destroy each
other's lives as adults.

48:33.210 --> 48:35.688
There's a profound poetry to it.

48:35.712 --> 48:39.125
Another step 20 years ago?
We might have been lovers.

48:39.149 --> 48:40.460
That's great, but
will you just...

48:40.484 --> 48:42.562
Just take a breath
for a second, huh?

48:42.586 --> 48:46.633
Listen to me, as your
nephew and trusted counsel,

48:46.657 --> 48:48.001
if you're gonna let
Paulie do this,

48:48.025 --> 48:49.736
then you have to
get out of town.

48:49.760 --> 48:51.237
Go somewhere.

48:51.261 --> 48:53.130
Anywhere but here.
It's not safe.

48:54.298 --> 48:56.542
There's an old island proverb.

48:56.566 --> 48:58.344
"The coral waxes,

48:58.368 --> 49:00.446
the palm grows,

49:00.470 --> 49:02.372
but man departs."

49:04.207 --> 49:06.452
Jesus Christ.

49:06.476 --> 49:08.388
They've drawn first blood.

49:08.412 --> 49:10.314
We have to retaliate.

49:11.748 --> 49:13.293
And when the smoke clears,

49:13.317 --> 49:15.728
they will see that
they want no part

49:15.752 --> 49:18.131
of a conflict with me.

49:18.155 --> 49:19.632
You're nuts.

49:19.656 --> 49:21.067
I can't talk to you.
You're nuts.

49:21.091 --> 49:22.993
I'll... I'll go
talk with gramps.

49:24.328 --> 49:26.539
Gramps died.

49:26.563 --> 49:28.332
He passed last night.

49:34.805 --> 49:36.173
Was it peaceful?

49:38.508 --> 49:40.486
He passed in his sleep.

49:40.510 --> 49:43.146
The nurse found
him this morning.

49:56.593 --> 49:58.195
Yeah.

50:07.604 --> 50:09.415
Hey, it's me. Where are you?

50:10.841 --> 50:12.542
All right, stay there.
I'm on my way.

50:30.227 --> 50:31.728
So, listen, um...

50:36.733 --> 50:38.568
Eva, I know who your father is.

50:41.138 --> 50:43.140
I've always known who he is.

50:47.577 --> 50:49.546
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean.

50:53.884 --> 50:57.563
What are the chances of
this happening, hmm?

50:57.587 --> 50:58.731
The one woman in
the entire world

50:58.755 --> 51:00.366
who I cannot, should not,

51:00.390 --> 51:02.592
ever get involved with.

51:04.761 --> 51:07.540
So when the time comes to make
a life-changing decision,

51:07.564 --> 51:10.877
we pause, weigh the options.

51:10.901 --> 51:14.547
Walking away from my line
of work is not one, so...

51:14.571 --> 51:18.651
Like anything painful, it needs to be
done quickly and without hesitation.

51:18.675 --> 51:22.588
I know the guys who
came after you today.

51:22.612 --> 51:25.892
They're not gonna stop.

51:25.916 --> 51:27.860
My point is, we can't
stay here, okay?

51:27.884 --> 51:30.163
So I need you to pack a bag,
just for a couple of days

51:30.187 --> 51:33.266
and let's go somewhere else.

51:33.290 --> 51:35.568
- Give us time to think.
- Where are we gonna go?

51:35.592 --> 51:37.437
Doesn't matter.

51:37.461 --> 51:39.396
I'm asking you to trust me.
We don't have time.

51:42.899 --> 51:44.944
Please.

51:44.968 --> 51:47.471
I'll be right back.

52:25.976 --> 52:28.354
How you doin', Gabe?

52:28.378 --> 52:29.956
I'm bringing her in.

52:29.980 --> 52:31.424
We're doing this
the civilized way.

52:31.448 --> 52:33.392
- Is that so?
- Yeah, it is.

52:33.416 --> 52:35.761
Out of mutual respect for Tony,
we're doing this gentle.

52:35.785 --> 52:38.498
I knew the boys that
got shot, Gabe.

52:38.522 --> 52:40.700
Good guys.

52:40.724 --> 52:42.702
Real slick, courting
the shark's daughter.

52:42.726 --> 52:44.737
Might move you up in this world.

52:44.761 --> 52:46.506
You have some imagination,
Paulie, you know that?

52:46.530 --> 52:47.907
I could give a shit
about caterina.

52:47.931 --> 52:51.677
Those boys, they
were my friends.

52:51.701 --> 52:52.836
Are we done?

52:56.006 --> 52:57.541
We're done.

52:58.808 --> 53:00.677
I'll tell you when we're done.

53:01.711 --> 53:03.689
Paulie, what?

53:03.713 --> 53:06.650
Couldn't leave it alone, could you?
Huh?

53:21.031 --> 53:22.399
It's all right.

53:35.545 --> 53:36.913
He never fucking learns.

54:08.111 --> 54:10.456
You okay?

54:10.480 --> 54:12.449
I have a delayed
reaction to stress.

54:14.084 --> 54:16.653
It passes.

56:49.906 --> 56:53.219
- Let her go. -Are you
dictating terms to me?

56:53.243 --> 56:55.888
I'm asking you nicely.

56:55.912 --> 56:57.823
Fuck you.

56:57.847 --> 57:00.493
Five million in hard cash.

57:00.517 --> 57:03.562
You get it to me or you
never see her again.

57:03.586 --> 57:06.055
You try anything at
all, I will kill her.

57:10.660 --> 57:12.772
Watch the girl.

57:12.796 --> 57:14.931
If they try anything,
you know what to do.

57:21.204 --> 57:22.939
We know what to do, boss.

57:25.141 --> 57:27.286
You listen to me,
you do nothing,

57:27.310 --> 57:29.846
absolutely nothing,
you understand?

59:21.925 --> 59:24.069
I don't like guns.

59:24.093 --> 59:26.906
Spent too much of my
youth cleaning them.

59:26.930 --> 59:31.377
The problem is, owning one is
never the end of the story.

59:31.401 --> 59:33.136
You have to be
prepared to use it.

01:00:30.827 --> 01:00:32.805
There's a saying,

01:00:32.829 --> 01:00:35.140
you kill a man, and
you're a murderer.

01:00:35.164 --> 01:00:37.000
You kill thousands,
you're a conqueror.

01:00:39.035 --> 01:00:42.171
I can no longer deny who's blood
is running through my veins.

01:00:49.045 --> 01:00:51.347
He's here.

01:01:10.533 --> 01:01:12.511
She really that special, Gabe?

01:01:12.535 --> 01:01:15.338
You're really gonna throw
it all away for her?

01:01:17.507 --> 01:01:19.184
I don't think there
was ever a man

01:01:19.208 --> 01:01:21.878
who was willing to throw
it all away for me.

01:01:26.115 --> 01:01:27.884
Makes me strangely jealous.

01:01:29.318 --> 01:01:30.787
It's funny, isn't it?

01:01:31.888 --> 01:01:33.856
It's sad, actually.

01:01:41.864 --> 01:01:44.943
Feeling sorry for me, Gabe?

01:01:44.967 --> 01:01:48.271
Don't think our DNA has a
capacity for sympathy.

01:01:49.806 --> 01:01:52.017
We need a moral
compass for that.

01:01:52.041 --> 01:01:55.521
My earliest memories,

01:01:55.545 --> 01:01:59.391
since I was a kid,
they're all...

01:01:59.415 --> 01:02:01.918
All variations of
wanting to be like you.

01:02:04.087 --> 01:02:05.755
Just do what do you do.

01:02:09.592 --> 01:02:12.061
And when did that change?

01:02:14.564 --> 01:02:15.932
I don't remember.

01:02:19.235 --> 01:02:22.905
How did I go so wrong
with you, Gabriel?

01:02:36.586 --> 01:02:39.965
That's as close as
you'll ever get to her.

01:02:39.989 --> 01:02:41.290
Keep it as a souvenir.

01:02:47.497 --> 01:02:49.365
You shouldn't have done it.

01:02:50.399 --> 01:02:52.945
What do you want?

01:02:52.969 --> 01:02:55.138
You knew I couldn't
let her live.

01:02:57.473 --> 01:02:59.585
I'll tell you what.

01:02:59.609 --> 01:03:03.889
You go home, think about what
you're doing with your life.

01:03:03.913 --> 01:03:06.149
Call me in the morning
and apologize.

01:03:07.450 --> 01:03:11.130
We're family.

01:03:11.154 --> 01:03:13.132
I'll let you do that.

01:03:13.156 --> 01:03:15.291
You shouldn't have done it, c.

01:03:31.974 --> 01:03:33.876
You don't know me.

01:03:38.481 --> 01:03:40.116
You never did.

01:03:44.921 --> 01:03:47.190
But I always looked out for you.

01:03:55.398 --> 01:03:58.277
You want her?

01:03:58.301 --> 01:04:00.045
Hmm?

01:04:00.069 --> 01:04:01.904
She's in there.

01:04:19.655 --> 01:04:22.467
Hey! Where the fuck you going?
Get the fuck in there.

01:04:22.491 --> 01:04:24.469
You better talk to him,
or I'm gonna talk to him.

01:04:29.632 --> 01:04:32.077
Calm down! Calm down!
You better talk to him.

01:05:01.764 --> 01:05:04.267
Non-slip lambskin gloves.

01:05:15.344 --> 01:05:18.080
Amber tint target
defining glasses.

01:05:24.587 --> 01:05:26.188
Foam earplugs.

01:05:28.758 --> 01:05:32.561
Preparation in any encounter
is half the battle.

01:05:39.435 --> 01:05:41.704
She did the only thing
she understood.

01:05:45.574 --> 01:05:48.077
Paulie!

01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:08.040
Gabe, Paulie sent me out
here to talk to you.

01:06:08.064 --> 01:06:11.334
I want you to put that gun
down and we'll talk this out.

01:06:13.803 --> 01:06:16.415
Gabe! Gabe, come on!

01:06:16.439 --> 01:06:18.674
We're on the same team here.
What are you doing?

01:06:19.842 --> 01:06:21.444
This is family.

01:07:14.363 --> 01:07:18.401
Come out, Gabe! Told
you I'd beat your ass!

01:07:19.902 --> 01:07:22.471
Did I hurt your feelings?

01:08:52.294 --> 01:08:54.363
We're cool, all right?

01:09:01.470 --> 01:09:02.981
Hold on. Hold on.

01:09:03.005 --> 01:09:04.740
Come on.

01:11:08.564 --> 01:11:09.865
Do you know who I am?

01:11:17.106 --> 01:11:18.450
I'm Tony Romano.

01:11:18.474 --> 01:11:21.386
Sometimes known as "the shark."

01:11:21.410 --> 01:11:23.646
I really don't like
that nickname.

01:11:25.648 --> 01:11:27.316
I'm Italian, not a spic.

01:11:36.458 --> 01:11:38.927
You know, I carried a
torch for her once.

01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:53.551
You're Gabe tancredi.

01:11:53.575 --> 01:11:56.154
She's your aunt, right?

01:11:56.178 --> 01:11:59.491
You know, you're more fucked
up than I imagined you were.

01:11:59.515 --> 01:12:02.751
She was more man than you
could ever hope to be.

01:12:05.621 --> 01:12:08.090
Tell me, Gabe, how did you see
this playing out in your head?

01:12:09.858 --> 01:12:12.671
Did you see yourself just
walking away from this?

01:12:12.695 --> 01:12:15.464
I saw my chances just
slightly better than yours.

01:12:19.802 --> 01:12:23.782
You know, they say the word
"mafia" was coined in a revolt

01:12:23.806 --> 01:12:25.650
that happened when
a French soldier

01:12:25.674 --> 01:12:28.586
raped a young palermo
woman on her wedding day

01:12:28.610 --> 01:12:30.722
on easter Monday, 1282.

01:12:30.746 --> 01:12:34.526
A group of sicilian men retaliated
by killing the French soldier.

01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:37.095
As the news spread
of the retaliation,

01:12:37.119 --> 01:12:39.898
the word "mafia" became
the sicilian battle cry,

01:12:39.922 --> 01:12:42.867
coined from the
raped girl's mother

01:12:42.891 --> 01:12:47.872
who ran through the streets
yelling and shouting,

01:12:47.896 --> 01:12:50.532
"ma-fi-a! Ma-fi-a!"

01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:53.878
Which in Italian means

01:12:53.902 --> 01:12:56.739
"my daughter, my daughter."

01:13:00.209 --> 01:13:04.580
So I came here for
my daughter, my Eva.

01:13:06.014 --> 01:13:08.193
And I really don't care
about anything else,

01:13:08.217 --> 01:13:11.229
but leaving here with her.

01:13:11.253 --> 01:13:12.888
Do you understand?

01:13:25.534 --> 01:13:26.835
She's gone.

01:13:30.105 --> 01:13:33.118
I don't know how they did it,

01:13:33.142 --> 01:13:35.711
and I don't know
why they did it...

01:13:37.546 --> 01:13:38.857
But I blame every motherfucker

01:13:38.881 --> 01:13:39.858
in this room.

01:13:39.882 --> 01:13:40.883
Shit.

Mr. Romano was my
employer for 10 years.

01:17:17.466 --> 01:17:21.236
He may not have been
perfect, but was fair.

01:17:23.872 --> 01:17:26.451
He was retiring this year.

01:17:26.475 --> 01:17:30.712
Do you know who he chose
to take over after him?

01:17:39.021 --> 01:17:41.223
We both lose today, Casper.

01:17:45.327 --> 01:17:47.438
You want it?

01:17:47.462 --> 01:17:49.865
It's yours. Take it all.

01:17:53.268 --> 01:17:54.912
I don't need...

01:17:54.936 --> 01:17:56.481
Does she mean that much to you?

01:17:56.505 --> 01:17:59.374
They killed her just like
they kill everything else.

01:18:03.045 --> 01:18:06.882
This place makes me sick.
Just, uh, take what you want.

01:18:16.491 --> 01:18:21.172
Wake up and go to bed

01:18:21.196 --> 01:18:26.110
knowing that I turned my
back on the one person,

01:18:26.134 --> 01:18:29.347
on the one person who kept me
from fulfilling my destiny,

01:18:29.371 --> 01:18:33.241
a position I groomed and
nurtured for years.

01:18:35.210 --> 01:18:38.222
Digesting abuse,

01:18:38.246 --> 01:18:42.384
slaving like a dog, for what?

01:18:53.562 --> 01:18:56.998
You turn into a sad story
I'll tell over a drink.

01:19:18.386 --> 01:19:20.455
I won't be that man
today, Gabriel.

01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:27.496
You're not about
to just walk away.

01:19:28.964 --> 01:19:31.166
The present is all
a man has anyways.

01:19:32.601 --> 01:19:36.047
Can't dwell on the past
to survive in the future.

01:19:36.071 --> 01:19:39.617
In our game we live for
the moment, right?

01:19:39.641 --> 01:19:42.010
Or not at all.

01:19:45.580 --> 01:19:48.583
It's only life that hurts.

01:19:50.252 --> 01:19:52.821
Death carries with
it no pain at all.

01:20:14.342 --> 01:20:16.378
This is barbaric, man.

01:20:18.647 --> 01:20:20.258
Let's not do this.

01:20:20.282 --> 01:20:24.362
Just, Casper, just...
Just, just take the cup.

01:20:24.386 --> 01:20:25.596
All right?

01:20:25.620 --> 01:20:27.131
I was planning on
leaving this morning.

01:20:27.155 --> 01:20:30.668
My plans haven't changed.

01:20:30.692 --> 01:20:34.196
Listen to me, I'm
giving it to you.

01:20:37.499 --> 01:20:38.976
I'll just disappear.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:44.482
- Just...
- That's the thing.

01:20:44.506 --> 01:20:46.017
When it comes down to it,

01:20:46.041 --> 01:20:48.009
I didn't really care
about any of it either.

01:20:49.678 --> 01:20:51.980
Not like they did.

01:20:54.082 --> 01:20:56.051
Guess I'm not the
designating type.

01:20:57.953 --> 01:21:00.622
I do my own dirty work.
You ready?

01:21:33.355 --> 01:21:34.489
Are you ready?

01:21:36.558 --> 01:21:37.926
We'll see.

01:22:26.474 --> 01:22:31.088
Just look at your face, man.
Just...

01:22:31.112 --> 01:22:34.759
Casper, this is a no-win
situation, all right?

01:22:34.783 --> 01:22:36.651
Just walk away. You
got nothin' to prove.

01:22:43.058 --> 01:22:44.359
Wrong again.

01:23:34.376 --> 01:23:37.154
- She's alive.
- What?

01:23:37.178 --> 01:23:41.149
You thought she was
dead, but she's alive.

01:23:43.151 --> 01:23:44.386
She's in the back.

01:23:47.489 --> 01:23:50.434
I could have beat you,

01:23:50.458 --> 01:23:51.559
but I have not.

01:23:52.861 --> 01:23:56.464
Hey, hey, you done?

01:23:58.233 --> 01:24:01.770
You done? You're done.

01:24:05.273 --> 01:24:06.808
You did it all for love, man.

01:24:09.511 --> 01:24:11.179
That's beautiful.

01:24:57.459 --> 01:24:59.127
Shh, shh, shh.

01:25:07.535 --> 01:25:09.847
What should we do?
What should we do?

01:25:09.871 --> 01:25:12.349
I need you to trust me.

01:25:12.373 --> 01:25:15.286
But you gotta promise me...

01:25:15.310 --> 01:25:16.353
You gotta keep your eyes closed.

01:25:16.377 --> 01:25:18.389
Do you understand?

01:25:18.413 --> 01:25:21.325
- Say it.
- Mmm.

01:25:21.349 --> 01:25:23.284
Okay.

01:25:24.319 --> 01:25:25.753
Hi.

01:25:28.857 --> 01:25:30.758
All right, keep 'em closed.

01:25:44.472 --> 01:25:47.651
10 hours in a Mexican hospital
couldn't save my arm,

01:25:47.675 --> 01:25:51.222
but I'll live, and
Eva will forgive me.

01:25:51.246 --> 01:25:53.257
And although we laugh and love,

01:25:53.281 --> 01:25:55.626
ultimately we lost.

01:25:55.650 --> 01:25:57.952
We lost all the reasons
we couldn't be together.

01:25:58.987 --> 01:26:01.265
Do I feel bad about it?

01:26:01.289 --> 01:26:02.833
No.

01:26:02.857 --> 01:26:05.293
I didn't throw up, if
that's what you mean.
