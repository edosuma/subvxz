02:15.265 --> 02:16.571
I guess the real question is:

02:16.614 --> 02:18.442

for a flesh wound

before this case finishes

09:27.218 --> 09:28.829

through the courts.

09:28.872 --> 09:31.875

in the meantime,

09:31.919 --> 09:35.139
jackasses will line up
on both sides of the argument

09:35.183 --> 09:38.665

to make more trouble.

09:38.708 --> 09:40.014
Hmm.

09:40.057 --> 09:42.103
I'd always heard

09:42.146 --> 09:46.716
that you were this crusader
for civil rights, human rights.

09:47.804 --> 09:50.546
I like to think I have
been a significant voice

09:50.590 --> 09:52.548
in that conversation,

09:52.592 --> 09:55.943
a meaningful advocate for people
whose rights have been violated.

09:55.986 --> 09:59.163
And it may seem like just a
flesh wound to you, Dr. Bull,

09:59.207 --> 10:01.601
but to me, it's a
bullet to the heart.

10:01.644 --> 10:03.994
I'm reasonably sure if
that had been a white man

10:04.038 --> 10:06.562
in that bathroom, there'd
have been no shots fired.

10:06.606 --> 10:09.696
I've also learned over the years
that the only thing that changes

10:09.739 --> 10:11.654
an entrenched institution

10:11.698 --> 10:15.789
like the City of New York is a
big ding to their bank account.

10:15.832 --> 10:17.921
And that's what
I'm really after.

10:17.965 --> 10:20.010

10:20.054 --> 10:22.534

we're going to court.

10:35.286 --> 10:37.549

and the NYPD.

10:37.593 --> 10:39.203
Oh, my God.

10:39.247 --> 10:41.075
And our strategy is...?

10:41.118 --> 10:43.643
Well, Malia Ford is obviously
gonna make this case about race.

10:43.686 --> 10:45.296
So in choosing our jurors,

10:45.340 --> 10:46.863
we are gonna do
everything we can

10:46.907 --> 10:48.778
to make it about everything but.

10:48.822 --> 10:50.475
And how do we do that?

10:50.519 --> 10:53.174
Well, we want to concentrate
on the circumstances.

10:53.217 --> 10:55.959
Not the people.

10:56.003 --> 10:57.744
When you present
the circumstances,

10:57.787 --> 10:59.615
there is a solid foundation
of facts

10:59.659 --> 11:02.792
that supports the idea
that Officer Harris...

11:02.836 --> 11:06.274
was reasonably in fear
for her life.

11:06.317 --> 11:09.669
She shot Cal Peterson
in self-defense.

11:09.712 --> 11:12.149
White or black, our ideal juror

11:12.193 --> 11:16.066
is someone who would make
the same split-second decision.

11:16.110 --> 11:19.026
Someone who doesn't take time
to think in a crisis

11:19.069 --> 11:20.592
but reacts in a blink.

11:20.636 --> 11:22.203
What I call a "Blink Reactor."

11:22.246 --> 11:25.075
Okay. So now we're looking
for Blink Reactors.

11:25.119 --> 11:26.860
Whatever those are.

11:26.903 --> 11:29.079
BULL: We're not
simply relying on how

11:29.123 --> 11:31.386
jurors tell us they'd react
in a crisis,

11:31.429 --> 11:34.258
but also how long they take
to answer the question.

11:34.302 --> 11:38.088
The main thing is we don't care
who these Blink Reactors are.

11:38.132 --> 11:42.440
In fact, the more our jury looks
like a jury forCal Peterson,

11:42.484 --> 11:44.704
the more we will have started

11:44.747 --> 11:46.096
to convince everyone
in that courtroom,

11:46.140 --> 11:48.751
most especially that jury,

11:48.795 --> 11:52.494
that we're not trying a case
about race.

11:52.537 --> 11:56.759
We're trying a case
about circumstances.

11:56.803 --> 11:58.021
Hello, Miss Sloane.

11:58.065 --> 12:01.024
I see that you are
a hair stylist.

12:01.068 --> 12:02.983
Actually, I own my own salon.

12:03.026 --> 12:04.506
That's terrific.

12:04.549 --> 12:06.943
Now, let's say one day...

12:06.987 --> 12:10.120
a gentleman comes
into your salon.

12:10.164 --> 12:13.123
I don't know if he's crazy
or high on PCP,

12:13.167 --> 12:15.212
and he grabs one
of your scissors,

12:15.256 --> 12:16.779
and he starts
swinging it around.

12:16.823 --> 12:18.215
Threatening you
and your customers.

12:19.608 --> 12:21.001
What would you do?

12:23.786 --> 12:26.571
Come on.
You a thinker or a blinker?

12:26.615 --> 12:28.573
I want you on this jury.

12:28.617 --> 12:30.401
MARISSA:
Seven seconds.

12:30.445 --> 12:32.795
Eight seconds.BULL:
You can do this.

12:32.839 --> 12:35.537
Throw bleach in his face.
Hit him with your hair dryer.

12:38.279 --> 12:39.584
Move to strike,
Your Honor.

12:39.628 --> 12:41.021
What we don't want

12:41.064 --> 12:42.979
are people who lack
the confidence to take action.

12:43.023 --> 12:44.938
Now, Mr. Sails,
you work the door

12:44.981 --> 12:46.287
at a club.
Am I correct?

12:46.330 --> 12:49.464
Yes, I do.Now, I bet when
it gets pretty late,

12:49.507 --> 12:51.118
people have had
too much to drink,

12:51.161 --> 12:53.033
gets kind of wild, huh?SAILS: It does.

12:53.076 --> 12:54.643
BENNY:
So let me ask you:

12:54.686 --> 12:57.254
what would you do if one of your
customers took a swing at you?

12:57.298 --> 13:00.736
I would make it my business to
see to it that he regrets it.

13:00.780 --> 13:02.869
Instantly.

13:02.912 --> 13:04.000
Without hesitation?

13:04.044 --> 13:06.046
Instantly.

13:09.397 --> 13:12.835
We also want jurors who believe
people have a fundamental right

13:12.879 --> 13:14.968
to protect what's theirs,
whether it's their property,

13:15.011 --> 13:18.232
their life or the lives
of their loved ones.

13:18.275 --> 13:20.060
Have you ever had your home

13:20.103 --> 13:21.931
or apartment broken into?

13:21.975 --> 13:23.454
Yes, a couple of years back.

13:23.498 --> 13:26.588
And were you there at the time?No, thank goodness.

13:26.631 --> 13:28.459
Thank goodness
because you suspect the robber

13:28.503 --> 13:29.852
might have hurt you or...?

13:29.896 --> 13:32.202
Thank goodness because if
I would have been there,

13:32.246 --> 13:35.075
there'd be one dead
robber right now.

13:36.990 --> 13:38.469
This juror's acceptable
to the defense, Your Honor.

13:38.513 --> 13:40.254
Ms. Ford?

13:40.297 --> 13:43.300
This juror is acceptable
to the plaintiff, as well.

13:43.344 --> 13:45.825
Then it looks
like we've got our jury.

13:47.870 --> 13:50.090
I saw your boss on the
front page of the paper.

13:50.133 --> 13:53.658
Sitting in court beside that
cop that shot Cal Peterson.

13:53.702 --> 13:54.877
Okay.

13:54.921 --> 13:56.096
CHUNK:
You know, Anna,

13:56.139 --> 13:57.749
it's my job.
I don't run the company.

13:57.793 --> 13:59.099
I just work there.

13:59.142 --> 14:01.971
You can hear how pathetic
that sounds, right?

14:02.015 --> 14:03.190
Actually, I can't.

14:03.233 --> 14:06.236
'Cause I know how hard
good jobs are to get.

14:06.280 --> 14:08.108
And I know how important
my job is right now,

14:08.151 --> 14:10.197
seeing as that you're
the one going to school.

14:10.240 --> 14:13.156
And yeah, I know
all about your scholarships,

14:13.200 --> 14:16.203
but somebody's got to pay
for books and housing...

14:16.246 --> 14:17.595
Still pathetic.

14:18.640 --> 14:20.642
[sighs]

14:22.687 --> 14:25.647
I ever tell you what my dad
gave me for my 14th birthday?

14:27.127 --> 14:28.955
He gave me "The Talk."

14:28.998 --> 14:31.740
Sat me down and told me
all about how I should act

14:31.783 --> 14:33.350
around the police.

14:33.394 --> 14:35.135
"Don't attract attention.

14:35.178 --> 14:36.745
"Don't make them mad.

14:36.788 --> 14:39.661
Do whatever they say
the second they say do it."

14:39.704 --> 14:41.271
[scoffs]

14:41.315 --> 14:44.622
And it all made me
so angry.

14:44.666 --> 14:47.277
I was embarrassed that he
was telling me those things.

14:47.321 --> 14:50.454
I was embarrassed
that he believed those things.

14:50.498 --> 14:53.327
And I was enraged
that he accepted those things.

14:55.372 --> 14:57.287
But deep down,

14:57.331 --> 14:59.681
I knew what he was
trying to do.

14:59.724 --> 15:03.337
He was trying to...
tell me the truth.

15:03.380 --> 15:06.775
And I knew my white friends
weren't having that talk.

15:06.818 --> 15:07.994
[scoffs]

15:08.037 --> 15:09.256
Not on their 14th birthday.

15:09.299 --> 15:10.648
Not on their 40th birthday.

15:10.692 --> 15:12.737
So, then, how can you go

15:12.781 --> 15:15.131
and defend a white cop
who shot one of us?

15:15.175 --> 15:18.308
Well, this is what
I tell myself.

15:18.352 --> 15:20.963
For the justice system
to really work,

15:21.007 --> 15:24.097
it has to be colorblind.

15:24.140 --> 15:27.013
Look, I don't know what
really happened that night.

15:27.056 --> 15:29.363
Who's right. Who's wrong.

15:29.406 --> 15:31.843
But me being a part of it,

15:31.887 --> 15:34.977
me being involved
in the fact-finding process?

15:35.021 --> 15:37.240
Well, I have to believe
that somewhere,

15:37.284 --> 15:39.460
my dad is smiling.

15:43.203 --> 15:45.553
DANNY:
Veronica Hill?

15:45.596 --> 15:47.642
Ms. Hill. Hi.

15:47.685 --> 15:49.165
My name is Danny James.

15:49.209 --> 15:51.341
I'm an investigator working
on the Cal Peterson case.

15:51.385 --> 15:53.561
The unarmed schoolteacher
who was shot

15:53.604 --> 15:55.171
by the female police officer.

15:55.215 --> 15:57.304
Okay, but I don't know anything
about that

15:57.347 --> 15:58.870
other than what I read online.

15:58.914 --> 16:02.004
Isn't it true that Cal Peterson
was your driver last year

16:02.048 --> 16:03.875
after you summoned a rideshare
service on your phone?

16:03.919 --> 16:06.530
I'm sorry. I don't
have time for this.

16:06.574 --> 16:08.924
I have to pick something up for
my boss and get it back to him.

16:08.968 --> 16:11.274
But I saw that you filed a
complaint against Mr. Peterson.

16:11.318 --> 16:12.797
Do you mind
telling me what happened?

16:12.841 --> 16:15.148
Look, I really don't want
to get dragged

16:15.191 --> 16:17.237
into a big case like this.

16:17.280 --> 16:19.543
Or I can subpoena you.

16:22.546 --> 16:26.289
SCOTT:
That's the jury you picked?

16:26.333 --> 16:28.248
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

16:28.291 --> 16:31.599
Nope. A lot of this
is just dumb luck.

16:31.642 --> 16:33.688
You still sure
you don't want to settle?

16:33.731 --> 16:35.516
CAL:
I had been

16:35.559 --> 16:38.040
to a big celebratory dinner
earlier in the evening.

16:38.084 --> 16:40.564
Um, it was
a citywide celebration

16:40.608 --> 16:43.263
honoring public education
and public schoolteachers,

16:43.306 --> 16:45.047
and I actually received

16:45.091 --> 16:47.006
a Teacher of the Year award
from the mayor.

16:47.049 --> 16:48.703
And after this dinner,
what did you do?

16:48.746 --> 16:50.357
Uh, went out
with some other teachers.

16:50.400 --> 16:51.706
Had a few more drinks.

16:51.749 --> 16:53.403
So, wait. Take us through this.

16:53.447 --> 16:55.579
You're drinking with friends...

16:55.623 --> 16:58.365
Well, uh...

16:58.408 --> 17:00.541
this is embarrassing.

17:00.584 --> 17:03.805
But the truth is I don't
normally drink very much.

17:03.848 --> 17:06.068
So when I left my friends

17:06.112 --> 17:08.331
and when I started to walk home,

17:08.375 --> 17:12.074
I realized, um,
I was pretty messed up.

17:12.118 --> 17:14.859
And then I started to get sick.

17:14.903 --> 17:16.687
And I knew
I really needed a bathroom,

17:16.731 --> 17:19.429
and there was that diner,
so I just ran in.

17:19.473 --> 17:23.042
I tried the men's room first,
but it was locked.

17:23.085 --> 17:25.479
I was feeling desperate.

17:25.522 --> 17:29.222
I... I didn't want
to make a mess on the floor,

17:29.265 --> 17:31.224
so I tried the door
to the ladies' room,

17:31.267 --> 17:32.486
and it wasn't locked.

17:32.529 --> 17:34.444
MARISSA: Surprise, surprise.
They like him.

17:34.488 --> 17:36.664
Truth be told, I like him.

17:36.707 --> 17:38.970
I don't recall anyone asking.

17:39.014 --> 17:42.931
Okay, so, you open the door
to the women's restroom.

17:42.974 --> 17:44.933
And what happened?

17:44.976 --> 17:46.413
Uh, there was a woman
on the toilet,

17:46.456 --> 17:49.372
but then I saw the sink...She was on the toilet?

17:49.416 --> 17:51.070
Just about.

17:51.113 --> 17:53.420
She may have been
unbuttoning her pants

17:53.463 --> 17:54.638
or something like that.

17:54.682 --> 17:57.380
This woman, is she
here in the courtroom?

17:58.425 --> 18:00.557
Right over there.

18:00.601 --> 18:02.516
Officer Harris.

18:02.559 --> 18:04.387
[gallery murmuring]

18:06.389 --> 18:08.522
So, you move toward the sink.

18:08.565 --> 18:09.914
And next thing I know,

18:09.958 --> 18:12.395
she pulled her gun
and was waving it in my face.

18:12.439 --> 18:14.832
And then, uh...

18:14.876 --> 18:16.834
then she shot me.

18:16.878 --> 18:19.620
MALIA:
Now, Mr. Peterson,

18:19.663 --> 18:22.057
after Officer Harris grabbed
her gun but before she shot you,

18:22.101 --> 18:26.017
isn't it true you grabbed
the barrel of that gun?

18:27.062 --> 18:28.803
I did.

18:28.846 --> 18:30.413
Can you tell us
why you did that?

18:32.459 --> 18:35.679
I guess it was just instinct.

18:35.723 --> 18:38.073
Seems like every time
you turn on the news,

18:38.117 --> 18:40.380
you hear about
some unarmed black man

18:40.423 --> 18:42.904
being shot by a white cop.

18:42.947 --> 18:45.646
[gallery murmuring]

18:45.689 --> 18:47.082
So when this white cop

18:47.126 --> 18:49.432
was pointing her gun at me,

18:49.476 --> 18:51.913
I knew.

18:51.956 --> 18:55.177
I knew she was gonna shoot me.

18:55.221 --> 18:58.398
So I grabbed the gun and tried
to aim it away from me.

18:58.441 --> 19:00.443
And thank God I did.

19:02.184 --> 19:04.317
She only got me in the arm.

19:04.360 --> 19:07.146
Who knows what she would've hit
if I hadn't.

19:07.189 --> 19:09.148
I could be dead.

19:09.191 --> 19:11.150
Objection! Speculation.

19:11.193 --> 19:12.325
Overruled.

19:12.368 --> 19:14.283
We have no more
questions at this time.

19:16.590 --> 19:17.939
[clears throat]

19:18.983 --> 19:21.769
So...

19:21.812 --> 19:24.032
we've heard a lot about...

19:24.075 --> 19:26.339
how much you had to drink
the night of the shooting.

19:26.382 --> 19:28.819
But I was wondering if you
could also tell me about...

19:28.863 --> 19:31.779
the illegal drugs
you also ingested

19:31.822 --> 19:33.389
that evening.

19:33.433 --> 19:34.347
[gallery murmuring]

19:34.390 --> 19:37.393
I'm sorry. I apologize.

19:37.437 --> 19:39.352
Must be me.
I didn't hear an answer.

19:39.395 --> 19:41.223
I didn't offer one.

19:41.267 --> 19:43.051
I don't have one.

19:43.094 --> 19:45.445
I didn't take any drugs
that evening.

19:45.488 --> 19:47.708
I don't take drugs. Ever.

19:47.751 --> 19:49.057
Oh, I'm sorry.

19:49.100 --> 19:51.233
[exhales] Forgive me.

19:51.277 --> 19:52.452
My mistake.

19:52.495 --> 19:53.931
Ah.

19:53.975 --> 19:56.543
I see what the problem is.

19:56.586 --> 20:00.329
I must have gotten thrown
off by this toxicity report.

20:00.373 --> 20:02.244
Taken on the night
of the shooting.

20:02.288 --> 20:05.160
See, they took you to
the hospital to stitch you up,

20:05.204 --> 20:06.814
and they took some blood.

20:06.857 --> 20:08.381
Remember?

20:08.424 --> 20:11.166
Objection! I haven't seen
any toxicity report.

20:11.210 --> 20:13.560
Defense didn't produce it
in discovery.

20:13.603 --> 20:15.257
Again, I apologize.

20:15.301 --> 20:17.520
I just got it
from the state lab last night.

20:17.564 --> 20:18.826
They've been backed up.

20:18.869 --> 20:21.176
That notwithstanding,
the plaintiff's counsel

20:21.220 --> 20:23.091
had the same access
to this report

20:23.134 --> 20:25.224
as I did, Your Honor.

20:29.140 --> 20:31.099
I'll allow it.

20:31.142 --> 20:32.970
Thank you, Your Honor.

20:33.014 --> 20:34.189
Now, according to this report,

20:34.233 --> 20:36.278
you weren't just drunk,
Mr. Peterson.

20:36.322 --> 20:38.411
You were high on MDMA.

20:38.454 --> 20:40.630
You know, MDMA?

20:40.674 --> 20:42.197
Molly?

20:43.677 --> 20:45.983
[scoffs]I need an answer, sir.

20:46.027 --> 20:47.594
Is it still your testimony

20:47.637 --> 20:49.378
that you didn't do any drugs
that evening?

20:49.422 --> 20:51.815
And let me remind you
that you are still under oath.

20:51.859 --> 20:54.557
No. I mean, yes.

20:54.601 --> 20:57.517
I absolutely didn't take
any drugs that night.

20:57.560 --> 21:00.128
All I can think of is maybe
somebody slipped something

21:00.171 --> 21:03.523
in my drink, but I certainly
wasn't aware of it.

21:03.566 --> 21:06.352
So someone slipped Molly

21:06.395 --> 21:08.441
in your drink while you
were out celebrating

21:08.484 --> 21:09.746
your Teacher of the Year award?

21:09.790 --> 21:11.531
Objection. Argumentative.

21:11.574 --> 21:13.228
Move it along, Mr. Colón.

21:13.272 --> 21:17.058
Certainly, Your Honor,
certainly.

21:17.101 --> 21:19.626
Th-The night that you charged

21:19.669 --> 21:23.151
into Officer Harris's
bathroom...

21:23.194 --> 21:24.631
that wasn't the first time

21:24.674 --> 21:26.197
that you physically threatened
a woman,

21:26.241 --> 21:28.330
was it, Mr. Peterson?

21:28.374 --> 21:29.984
I don't know
what you're talking about.

21:30.027 --> 21:32.378
Isn't it true that last year,

21:32.421 --> 21:34.380
at this time,
you used the evening hours

21:34.423 --> 21:38.427
to work as a driver for
a ridesharing company?

21:38.471 --> 21:41.561
And isn't it true that a
complaint was filed against you

21:41.604 --> 21:44.390
by one of your passengers?
A Ms. Veronica Hill?

21:44.433 --> 21:46.043
Objection.
Your Honor, relevance?

21:46.087 --> 21:48.350
The plaintiff's counsel
has gone to great lengths

21:48.394 --> 21:51.179
to present the plaintiff
as a model citizen.

21:51.222 --> 21:53.529
An honored teacher
who could do no wrong.

21:53.573 --> 21:55.575
She opened the door
to character, Your Honor.

21:55.618 --> 21:57.620
Overruled.

21:57.664 --> 21:59.274
BENNY:
Thank you.

21:59.318 --> 22:03.234
Now, let me refresh your memory,
Mr. Peterson.

22:03.278 --> 22:05.889
Isn't it true
that Ms. Hill became

22:05.933 --> 22:09.806
so uncomfortable
with the aggressive,

22:09.850 --> 22:13.593
sexual passes you made
while you were her driver,

22:13.636 --> 22:16.683
that she demanded you pull over
three and a half miles

22:16.726 --> 22:18.511
before she reached
her destination?

22:18.554 --> 22:22.515
She did ask me to pull over.

22:22.558 --> 22:24.560
But I wasn't being aggressive.

22:24.604 --> 22:27.128
It was really just
a misunderstanding.

22:27.171 --> 22:28.695
Oh, just a misunderstanding.

22:28.738 --> 22:32.655
But didn't you chase her on foot
after she exited your car?

22:32.699 --> 22:34.657
I was trying to reason with her.

22:34.701 --> 22:36.442
You were trying to reason with
her while you were chasing her,

22:36.485 --> 22:37.704
screaming at her,

22:37.747 --> 22:39.532
threatening her.

22:39.575 --> 22:41.708
I wasn't threatening her.

22:41.751 --> 22:44.537
I just...

22:44.580 --> 22:46.887
I just didn't want her
to file a complaint.

22:46.930 --> 22:49.542
I really needed that job.

22:51.718 --> 22:53.633
You're a big guy, Mr. Peterson.

22:53.676 --> 22:56.723
How big would you say
Ms. Hill was?

22:56.766 --> 22:58.899
Would you, would you say
that-that she was

22:58.942 --> 23:01.467
a... large woman?

23:01.510 --> 23:03.425
Or would you call
her average?

23:03.469 --> 23:08.038
Or-or-or might you use
the word "petite"?

23:08.082 --> 23:09.997
Petite.

23:10.040 --> 23:11.564
She was definitely petite.

23:11.607 --> 23:14.044
Petite.

23:14.088 --> 23:16.003
Got it.

23:17.787 --> 23:20.573
No further questions,
Your Honor.

23:20.616 --> 23:22.749
Let's take a 15 minute break.

23:25.665 --> 23:27.057
Nice work.

23:27.101 --> 23:29.016
You know...

23:30.583 --> 23:32.628
...for the first time,
I think, uh,

23:32.672 --> 23:34.717
we might actually have a
shot at winning this thing.

23:34.761 --> 23:37.111
I think so, too.

23:37.154 --> 23:39.679
And I think the plaintiff's
lawyer feels the same way,

23:39.722 --> 23:41.811
which is why I would urge you
to authorize me

23:41.855 --> 23:43.639
to use our newfound leverage

23:43.683 --> 23:46.860
to try again
and broker a settlement.

23:50.429 --> 23:54.433
Can you not feel the tension
in the air?

23:54.476 --> 23:56.783
I don't think there is a good
ending for our city,

23:56.826 --> 23:58.524
no matter which side wins.

23:58.567 --> 23:59.829
Dr. Bull,

23:59.873 --> 24:02.353
I hired you to clear

24:02.397 --> 24:04.921
this officer's good name.

24:04.965 --> 24:09.317
Why don't you worry about that
and let me worry about the city?

24:17.281 --> 24:19.153
When my client came through
the door, what state of dress

24:19.196 --> 24:22.069
or undress were you in?

24:22.112 --> 24:25.551
I had unbuttoned my pants and
I was pulling down my zipper.

24:26.639 --> 24:28.379
You must have been terrified.

24:28.423 --> 24:30.991
I was startled.

24:31.034 --> 24:33.036
My first concern was for my gun.

24:33.080 --> 24:35.430
It was on the sink
and I needed to secure it.

24:35.474 --> 24:38.389
So you weren't scared?

24:38.433 --> 24:40.522
There wasn't time to be scared.

24:40.566 --> 24:42.829
And besides, it didn't seem like
he was coming for me.

24:42.872 --> 24:44.657
It seemed like he was going
for my gun.

24:44.700 --> 24:47.573
And why would he be
going for the gun?

24:47.616 --> 24:49.923
And how would he have even
known that the person

24:49.966 --> 24:53.230
in the bathroom had a gun,
much less put it on the sink?

24:53.274 --> 24:57.713
That's a terrific question, and
one I don't have an answer to,

24:57.757 --> 24:59.672
except for the fact
that I could only deal

24:59.715 --> 25:02.109
with the information
that was in front of me.

25:02.152 --> 25:03.850
And the information
directly in front of me

25:03.893 --> 25:05.286
was that there was a man

25:05.329 --> 25:07.201
someplace he wasn't
supposed to be

25:07.244 --> 25:09.029
and he seemed to be going
for my gun.

25:09.072 --> 25:11.684
So that drove your
decision making?Absolutely.

25:11.727 --> 25:13.990
It didn't occur to you that
he might have been sick?

25:14.034 --> 25:16.384
That he might have been
going for the sink?

25:16.427 --> 25:17.907
I had no way of knowing that.

25:17.951 --> 25:20.606
He didn't look sick?

25:20.649 --> 25:21.737
His head was down.

25:21.781 --> 25:22.564
He stumbled, but...

25:22.608 --> 25:24.566
Did he look drunk?

25:24.610 --> 25:26.002
It was four steps between
the door and the sink.

25:26.046 --> 25:27.613
Did he look black?

25:27.656 --> 25:29.615
[sighs]

25:29.658 --> 25:31.573
He was black. He is black.

25:31.617 --> 25:34.358
Isn't that why you grabbed
for your gun?

25:34.402 --> 25:36.186
No. That's ridiculous.

25:36.230 --> 25:39.233
Without knowing what he
wanted, why he was there,

25:39.276 --> 25:41.235
you grabbed for your gun
because a black man

25:41.278 --> 25:43.585
was standing over you while
you went to the toilet,

25:43.629 --> 25:45.761
isn't that right?With all due respect,

25:45.805 --> 25:47.328
I was grabbing that gun
no matter who

25:47.371 --> 25:49.460
was standing over me
while I go to the toilet.

25:49.504 --> 25:52.594
[scoffs]
Did you struggle for the gun?

25:52.638 --> 25:54.553
No. I got to it first.

25:54.596 --> 25:56.250
I looked at the
bodycam footage.

25:56.293 --> 25:58.948
Didn't look to me like he
was even going for the gun.

25:58.992 --> 26:01.690
Is it possible
that you were wrong?

26:01.734 --> 26:04.606
Is it possible that h-he
wasn't going for the gun?

26:04.650 --> 26:05.607
You weren't there.

26:05.651 --> 26:06.695
Did you think he had a gun?

26:06.739 --> 26:09.524
It never crossed my mind.

26:09.568 --> 26:12.483
My only concern was that
he didn't take my gun.

26:12.527 --> 26:14.398
So I'm confused.

26:14.442 --> 26:16.531
If you had your gun,
and you weren't thinking

26:16.575 --> 26:18.141
about whether or
not he had one,

26:18.185 --> 26:20.230
then why were you pointing
it at him at all?

26:20.274 --> 26:22.406
Because...He was black?

26:22.450 --> 26:24.626
No.

26:24.670 --> 26:26.759
L-Look at the bodycam footage.

26:26.802 --> 26:29.022
The second I had the gun,
he was on me,

26:29.065 --> 26:31.111
trying to take the gun from me.

26:31.154 --> 26:33.635
Because you were
pointing it at him.

26:33.679 --> 26:35.724
Because he didn't
want to get shot.

26:35.768 --> 26:40.120
So the question is: why were
you pointing it at him at all?

26:40.163 --> 26:42.557
If all you wanted to do
was secure it,

26:42.601 --> 26:44.907
then why did you end up
pointing it at my client?

26:44.951 --> 26:47.649
Why did you end up
shooting my client?

26:47.693 --> 26:52.132
And isn't the answer
because he's black?

27:01.402 --> 27:03.883
Let's t-- let's
take a break.

27:03.926 --> 27:05.972
You okay?

27:08.714 --> 27:11.368
I'm thinking this is,
uh, about a tenth

27:11.412 --> 27:13.588
of what you can expect
to face on the stand

27:13.632 --> 27:15.155
when Malia Ford
questions you.

27:15.198 --> 27:17.679
You can't let her bait you.

27:17.723 --> 27:19.768
You can't let her anger you.

27:19.812 --> 27:22.728
This is her technique.
It's what she does.

27:22.771 --> 27:24.947
She's famous for it.

27:24.991 --> 27:27.558
You okay?
Mm.

27:29.517 --> 27:31.650
Great.

27:31.693 --> 27:33.042
Let's go to court.

27:33.086 --> 27:36.219
[crowd shouting]

27:43.923 --> 27:47.056
TONYA [on video]:
Halt! NYPD. Halt!

27:47.100 --> 27:48.754
W-What are you doing?

27:48.797 --> 27:51.713
Let go. Let go of the gun!

27:51.757 --> 27:53.019
[groans]

27:53.062 --> 27:55.848
CAL:
Oh, my God, you shot me!

27:55.891 --> 27:57.458
You really shot me. Oh.

27:57.501 --> 28:00.461
TONYA:
Precinct 55. Charlie to Cent...

28:00.504 --> 28:03.072
Wow. That's quite a tape.

28:05.814 --> 28:08.295
I'm sure you won't forget
anything about that night

28:08.338 --> 28:10.166
for years to come.

28:10.210 --> 28:12.821
Burned in my memory.

28:12.865 --> 28:15.128
So what color jacket
was my client wearing?

28:15.171 --> 28:16.912
Excuse me?

28:16.956 --> 28:19.132
What color sports jacket?

28:19.175 --> 28:21.134
Was it black?

28:21.177 --> 28:23.527
Was it blue? Was it brown?

28:25.834 --> 28:27.749
The witness will please answer.

28:27.793 --> 28:29.795
MALIA:
It's all right.

28:29.838 --> 28:32.362
I withdraw the question.

28:32.406 --> 28:34.843
But do you happen to recall

28:34.887 --> 28:37.411
the color of his shirt?

28:37.454 --> 28:40.327
I don't know.

28:40.370 --> 28:42.764
Mm. White?

28:42.808 --> 28:43.939
Mm.

28:43.983 --> 28:45.245
Yellow?

28:45.288 --> 28:47.247
Mmm.

28:47.290 --> 28:48.770
It was a very light blue.

28:48.814 --> 28:50.772
Mm.

28:50.816 --> 28:52.992
Now how about his face?

28:53.035 --> 28:54.776
Objection, Your Honor.

28:54.820 --> 28:56.822
Counsel is...[alarm blares]

28:57.997 --> 28:59.955
Ladies and gentlemen,
we've received a bomb threat.

28:59.999 --> 29:01.652
We're gonna need everyone to
leave the courthouse right now.

29:07.658 --> 29:09.138
CHUNK: According to
the commissioner's office,

29:09.182 --> 29:12.751
the bomb threat was specifically
targeted to our courtroom.

29:12.794 --> 29:15.405
Rather remarkable piece
of timing, actually.

29:15.449 --> 29:18.365
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

29:20.671 --> 29:22.978
That was not
great in there.

29:23.022 --> 29:26.112
You... you were not
great in there.

29:26.155 --> 29:29.158
I know.

29:29.202 --> 29:31.508
She makes me nervous.

29:31.552 --> 29:34.424
Well, maybe you want to
come down with something?

29:34.468 --> 29:36.905
So you don't have
to continue today?

29:38.689 --> 29:41.692
Boss. We got the all clear.
Everyone's headed back in.

29:44.783 --> 29:45.871
I'm fine.

29:45.914 --> 29:47.873
Are you sure?

29:47.916 --> 29:50.092
I'm fine.

29:53.182 --> 29:55.837
MALIA:
Now, where did we
leave off? Oh, yes,

29:55.881 --> 29:58.797
I was asking if you remember the
color of Mr. Peterson's face.

29:58.840 --> 30:01.582
It was black.

30:01.625 --> 30:03.497
We all know it was black.

30:03.540 --> 30:05.847
And it's your testimony that
that did not contribute

30:05.891 --> 30:07.893
in any way to your decision
to shoot him?

30:07.936 --> 30:10.809
Of course not.

30:10.852 --> 30:13.072
So, then, logically,
what you're really saying is,

30:13.115 --> 30:15.901
no matter who walked in
that room,

30:15.944 --> 30:18.164
you were gonna react
the same way.BENNY: Objection.

30:18.207 --> 30:20.383
Counsel is testifying.

30:20.427 --> 30:23.778
Overruled.
You may answer the question.

30:29.131 --> 30:31.830
Yes. No matter who
came through the door,

30:31.873 --> 30:33.657
I would have reacted
the same.

30:33.701 --> 30:35.094
An old woman?

30:35.137 --> 30:38.184
Yes. I believe so.

30:38.227 --> 30:40.447
You believe so?

30:40.490 --> 30:41.883
What about a child?

30:41.927 --> 30:43.972
A boy, a four-year-old boy?

30:44.016 --> 30:45.974
Your Honor, these are all
ridiculous hypotheticals.

30:46.018 --> 30:48.324
The attorney is badgering
the witness.

30:48.368 --> 30:50.936
I sense the attorney is trying
to make a point; I'll allow it,

30:50.979 --> 30:54.983
but let's get to it sooner
rather than later.

30:55.027 --> 30:56.898
I was asking about a child.

30:56.942 --> 31:00.206
A four-year-old boy,
you'd still point your gun?

31:00.249 --> 31:01.555
Of course not.

31:01.598 --> 31:04.471
Then it's not true.

31:04.514 --> 31:06.212
Despite your earlier testimony

31:06.255 --> 31:08.040
that no matter who walked
through the door,

31:08.083 --> 31:10.129
you were gonna behave
the same way.

31:10.172 --> 31:12.653
For some people
you point your gun,

31:12.696 --> 31:15.961
for others, no.
And, frankly,

31:16.004 --> 31:18.224
I think that's good.

31:18.267 --> 31:19.834
You're a professional.

31:19.878 --> 31:21.444
You should apply
critical thinking

31:21.488 --> 31:23.490
to a decision like this.

31:23.533 --> 31:25.753
So...

31:25.796 --> 31:29.365
at what age do you start
pointing your gun?

31:29.409 --> 31:31.759
If a person's 12?BENNY: Objection!

31:31.802 --> 31:34.153
JUDGE STALDER:
The point, please.14?

31:34.196 --> 31:38.287
It's a 20-year-old boy
instead of a 38-year-old man,

31:38.331 --> 31:40.159
you point your gun?

31:41.769 --> 31:44.946
What if it's a
20-year-old black boy?

31:44.990 --> 31:46.121
Come on.
BENNY:
Your Honor?

31:48.428 --> 31:51.126
[sighs]
You want the truth?

31:51.170 --> 31:52.258
Well, that would be nice.

31:52.301 --> 31:53.999
You always apply
critical thinking

31:54.042 --> 31:55.914
before you point your gun.

31:55.957 --> 31:58.133
But where does that
critical thinking come from?

31:59.265 --> 32:02.833
Two places-- your training
and your experience.

32:02.877 --> 32:07.403
And I'm sorry.
In my experience doing this job,

32:07.447 --> 32:10.580
if I'm in a women's bathroom,
and a man--

32:10.624 --> 32:13.975
yes, a black man--
if a black man

32:14.019 --> 32:17.674
walks into it at 2:00 in the
morning, and moves for my gun...[gallery clamoring]

32:17.718 --> 32:19.633
[gavel bangs]...I'm gonna get it first,
and I'm gonna

32:19.676 --> 32:21.156
point it at him,
and anybody...[gavel banging]

32:21.200 --> 32:23.071
...who does what I do
for a living

32:23.115 --> 32:24.986
and says any different
is a liar!

32:25.030 --> 32:26.988
[gallery clamoring]

32:27.032 --> 32:29.382
I have no further questions,
Your Honor.

32:40.915 --> 32:43.091
I'm so sorry.

32:43.135 --> 32:45.137
So, so sorry.

32:45.180 --> 32:47.356
I can't believe I did that.

32:47.400 --> 32:49.358
I just...

32:49.402 --> 32:51.404
I cracked.

32:55.582 --> 32:57.584
How bad is it?

32:58.846 --> 33:01.414
For our case?

33:01.457 --> 33:03.982
I'd say it's
fairly catastrophic.

33:12.903 --> 33:14.209
You want to tell me
what the hell happened

33:14.253 --> 33:15.428
in court today, Dr. Bull?

33:15.471 --> 33:17.343
No big deal.

33:17.386 --> 33:20.172
It's just, your totally innocent
officer decided

33:20.215 --> 33:22.826
to act on the stand
like she was... totally guilty.

33:22.870 --> 33:24.480
It happens all the...

33:24.524 --> 33:26.656
Wait. Actually,
it never happens.

33:26.700 --> 33:28.310
Well, I'm glad you're so amused.

33:28.354 --> 33:31.313
I've got reports that
my officers are being attacked

33:31.357 --> 33:33.228
all over the city,
and right now,

33:33.272 --> 33:37.058
I got a patrol car burning
in front of One Police Plaza.

33:37.102 --> 33:39.060
We told you what to do.

33:39.104 --> 33:41.149
Yes, you did.

33:41.193 --> 33:43.760
You win. I give up.

33:43.804 --> 33:46.589
You were right, so, let's
move to plan B, shall we?

33:46.633 --> 33:48.591
Sit down and settle this thing.

33:48.635 --> 33:50.071
Offer them
whatever you have to,

33:50.115 --> 33:51.420
but just do it quickly.

33:52.465 --> 33:54.293
We'll start making calls.

33:58.819 --> 34:00.821
[line ringing]

34:02.518 --> 34:06.000
On second thought, let's not
make any calls till morning.

34:08.002 --> 34:10.483
What she said was indefensible.

34:10.526 --> 34:11.701
I second that.

34:11.745 --> 34:15.096
[sighs]
Indefensible. Absolutely.

34:15.140 --> 34:17.794
The thing is, I'm not sure
I believe any of it.

34:17.838 --> 34:20.145
What do you mean?

34:20.188 --> 34:22.408
Well, in the car after court,

34:22.451 --> 34:24.975
she was saying
how sorry she was.

34:25.019 --> 34:27.108
She was shaking her head
the whole time,

34:27.152 --> 34:29.110
and it's not an absolute,

34:29.154 --> 34:31.982
but sometimes, that can indicate

34:32.026 --> 34:35.160
a person doesn't believe
what they're saying.

34:35.203 --> 34:37.466
Well, wait.
Why wouldn't she be sorry?

34:37.510 --> 34:41.731
Her testimony basically
torpedoed the city's whole case.

34:41.775 --> 34:43.603
I don't know.
It's just a feeling.

34:43.646 --> 34:44.952
DANNY:
Please.

34:44.995 --> 34:46.649
She's a racist.

34:46.693 --> 34:48.303
Uh, people show you one face

34:48.347 --> 34:50.697
when they know you're looking,
but the other one,

34:50.740 --> 34:52.307
the real one--

34:52.351 --> 34:55.136
it's always just peeking out
just a little bit,

34:55.180 --> 34:57.269
laughing at you for getting
suckered by the mask.

34:57.312 --> 34:59.140
If you say so.

35:00.402 --> 35:02.404
It's not what I'm feeling.

35:05.146 --> 35:07.279
Tomorrow?

35:07.322 --> 35:09.237
Tomorrow.
[clears throat]

35:10.499 --> 35:12.458
Danny, you have a copy
of that bodycam tape?

35:12.501 --> 35:14.155
I want to give it another look.

35:14.199 --> 35:16.288
Yeah, I'll send you the link.

35:16.331 --> 35:17.637
One last thing.

35:20.205 --> 35:24.122
Does anybody know where Cal
Peterson ended up throwing up?

35:24.165 --> 35:26.689
Well, he was sick.

35:26.733 --> 35:29.257
So sick he had to go
to the women's room.

35:29.301 --> 35:32.304
But I don't recall hearing
about where he threw up.

35:32.347 --> 35:35.481
You're right.
There was nothing about it

35:35.524 --> 35:38.048
in the crime scene photos,
nothing in the notes.

35:39.485 --> 35:40.877
I get the feeling

35:40.921 --> 35:43.358
we're not making any
settlement calls any time soon.

35:43.402 --> 35:45.317
I get the feeling
we should order in.

35:46.927 --> 35:48.189
[crowd shouting]

35:48.233 --> 35:50.060
SCOTT:
Gentlemen?

35:50.104 --> 35:51.845
Where are we?

35:51.888 --> 35:54.195
Why am I totally
in the blind here?

35:54.239 --> 35:56.066
Have we commenced
settlement discussions yet?

35:56.110 --> 35:58.765
We have not.I don't understand.

35:58.808 --> 36:01.898
You want the good news
or the bad news?Oh, come on.

36:01.942 --> 36:03.857
I have finally come to believe

36:03.900 --> 36:05.641
this case isn't
about race at all,

36:05.685 --> 36:08.383
and I think that is cause
for celebration.

36:08.427 --> 36:09.950
I'm not following you.

36:09.993 --> 36:12.692
I think it's really about good
old-fashioned American greed.

36:14.259 --> 36:15.651
And isn't it great
to know there exists

36:15.695 --> 36:17.610
at least two people
in this world who can finally

36:17.653 --> 36:20.526
look past race or skin color
or religious differences

36:20.569 --> 36:23.268
long enough to try and rip off
the City of New York

36:23.311 --> 36:25.183
for a few million dollars?

36:31.232 --> 36:34.366
Now, from your
tox screen report,

36:34.409 --> 36:36.411
we know that not
only were you

36:36.455 --> 36:38.326
legally intoxicated
the night of the shooting,

36:38.370 --> 36:40.067
but you were also high on Molly,

36:40.110 --> 36:42.765
as well.

36:42.809 --> 36:44.376
Mr. Peterson, I'm wondering

36:44.419 --> 36:47.553
if you might have been high
and drunk that night on purpose.

36:47.596 --> 36:50.730
I'm sorry.
I don't understand the question.

36:50.773 --> 36:53.602
Well, I'm asking if perhaps
you drank to excess

36:53.646 --> 36:55.517
and took some MDMA
in anticipation

36:55.561 --> 36:56.997
of getting shot that night.

36:57.040 --> 36:58.216
[gallery murmuring]

36:58.259 --> 37:00.609
A little something
to numb the pain.

37:00.653 --> 37:03.743
Objection! Now counsel is making
absurd assertions

37:03.786 --> 37:05.745
in the hopes
of confusing the jury

37:05.788 --> 37:08.008
and obfuscating facts
already in evidence.

37:08.051 --> 37:09.749
Mr. Colón, I think

37:09.792 --> 37:11.620
this courtroom has already seen
enough drama.

37:11.664 --> 37:14.623
I agree, Your Honor,
but I promise if

37:14.667 --> 37:16.582
you'll bear with
me a moment longer,

37:16.625 --> 37:18.061
I will substantiate
my allegations.

37:18.105 --> 37:20.934
Well, you'd better, or I will be
holding you in contempt.

37:20.977 --> 37:23.502
It's a simple question,
Mr. Peterson.

37:23.545 --> 37:26.287
Did you barge into that
bathroom that night

37:26.331 --> 37:27.854
knowing full well
that you were going

37:27.897 --> 37:29.638
to get shot by Officer Harris?

37:29.682 --> 37:31.031
[scoffs]

37:31.074 --> 37:33.642
Why would I want
to get shot by a cop?

37:33.686 --> 37:37.907
So we could all end up here,

37:37.951 --> 37:41.433
with you suing the City
of New York for $25 million.

37:41.476 --> 37:42.738
[laughing]
That's ridiculous.

37:42.782 --> 37:44.174
Well, yes.

37:44.218 --> 37:47.439
Unless of course,
Officer Harris was in on it.

37:47.482 --> 37:48.527
[gallery murmuring]

37:48.570 --> 37:50.268
MALIA:
Your Honor, do I even

37:50.311 --> 37:53.140
need to cite an objection?
This-this is outlandish![gavel bangs]

37:53.183 --> 37:54.968
[gallery murmuring]

37:55.011 --> 37:57.840
Yes, it is outlandish,
Your Honor, but I can assure you

37:57.884 --> 38:00.887
that I can prove that
Cal Peterson and Tonya Harris

38:00.930 --> 38:03.368
are not the strangers
they've been pretending to be.

38:03.411 --> 38:04.760
That, in fact,

38:04.804 --> 38:07.328
they've been romantically
involved for months now.

38:07.372 --> 38:08.721
[gallery clamoring]

38:08.764 --> 38:10.636
What the hell is he doing?

38:10.679 --> 38:13.726
You people are supposed
to be defending me.
Hmm.

38:13.769 --> 38:15.989
Technically, the City of
New York is our client.

38:16.032 --> 38:18.339
Since it seems you're
trying to swindle the city,

38:18.383 --> 38:20.907
I fear you and I have a
serious conflict of interest.

38:20.950 --> 38:22.300
[gavel banging]

38:22.343 --> 38:24.519
Mr. Peterson, is this true?

38:24.563 --> 38:25.825
Did you

38:25.868 --> 38:27.653
plan this shooting
with Officer Harris?

38:27.696 --> 38:29.655
Absolutely not.

38:29.698 --> 38:31.526
Look at the bodycam footage.

38:31.570 --> 38:33.006
I'm wrestling her for the gun.

38:33.049 --> 38:35.095
Were you?

38:35.138 --> 38:37.880
That's funny,
because the more I look at it,

38:37.924 --> 38:41.406
the more it looks like you were
holding the barrel of the gun

38:41.449 --> 38:43.495
to make sure
that the bullet went

38:43.538 --> 38:45.323
into your arm
and not your chest.

38:45.366 --> 38:47.107
[gallery murmuring]But...

38:47.150 --> 38:49.588
that could just be me.

38:49.631 --> 38:51.720
While you're thinking about it,
I'd like to enter

38:51.764 --> 38:55.115
into evidence
this certified business record

38:55.158 --> 38:59.032
of a history of Cal Peterson's
ridesharing customers.

38:59.075 --> 39:00.816
And let the record reflect

39:00.860 --> 39:02.340
that ten months ago,

39:02.383 --> 39:05.691
he drove a Miss Tonya Harris.

39:05.734 --> 39:08.084
Yeah. It's not surprising.

39:08.128 --> 39:11.653
We all know he likes
to use the ridesharing vehicle

39:11.697 --> 39:13.089
as his personal dating app.

39:13.133 --> 39:16.876
I drive hundreds of women,
probably thousands.

39:16.919 --> 39:18.878
[chuckles]

39:18.921 --> 39:22.360
But in truth, I don'tremember
driving that woman.

39:29.584 --> 39:31.194
BENNY:
Mr. Peterson,

39:31.238 --> 39:34.937
would it surprise you
to know that the...

39:34.981 --> 39:38.506
front desk clerk at the
Bridgecroft Motel in Astoria

39:38.550 --> 39:41.988
remembers checking you in
at least 23 times

39:42.031 --> 39:43.424
in the last
ten months?

39:43.468 --> 39:45.905
No. It wouldn't surprise me.

39:45.948 --> 39:48.081
My roommates can get loud.

39:48.124 --> 39:50.736
Sometimes I rent a cheap room
to grade papers,

39:50.779 --> 39:54.740
prepare lesson plans. Alone.

39:54.783 --> 39:56.742
[inhales sharply]

39:56.785 --> 39:58.439
Are you aware

39:58.483 --> 40:00.920
that there is video surveillance
cameras in the hallways,

40:00.963 --> 40:06.534
so the clerk can see if,
say, Tonya Harris decided

40:06.578 --> 40:09.058
to join you
in your room?

40:09.102 --> 40:11.496
I'd be happy to enter
the video surveillance cameras

40:11.539 --> 40:12.975
into evidence if you'd like.

40:13.019 --> 40:16.457
Or perhaps I can just call
Tonya Harris to the stand,

40:16.501 --> 40:19.852
see what she has to say.

40:19.895 --> 40:22.202
But...

40:22.245 --> 40:24.726
you know,
as a former prosecutor,

40:24.770 --> 40:28.730
I should tell you that
the person who confesses first

40:28.774 --> 40:31.298
is usually the one
who gets the lighter sentence.

40:44.833 --> 40:48.271
You are still under oath,
Officer Harris.

40:53.755 --> 40:57.846
We were lying in bed one night
at the Bridgecroft Motel,

40:57.890 --> 41:03.286
and he turned to me,
and he said...

41:03.330 --> 41:08.378
"You know, darlin',
I'd take a bullet for you."

41:11.381 --> 41:14.472
And the idea just grew
from there.

41:29.617 --> 41:32.359
How many years you
think they'll get?

41:32.402 --> 41:34.709
Whatever it is,
it's not long enough.

41:37.886 --> 41:40.846
I'm not sure I ever
made it clear, but...

41:40.889 --> 41:43.588
I admire the
hell out of you.

41:46.895 --> 41:48.636
[chuckles softly]

41:48.680 --> 41:50.551
[sighs]

41:50.595 --> 41:52.988
Would you like to get a drink?

41:55.034 --> 41:58.864
I would love to
get a drink, but, uh...

41:58.907 --> 42:00.082
[inhales sharply]

42:00.126 --> 42:03.172
I'm sort of between drinks
right now.

42:06.001 --> 42:08.482
If that circumstance
should ever change,

42:08.526 --> 42:10.571
you can be sure
that I will, uh...

42:10.615 --> 42:13.443
I'll call you first.

42:13.487 --> 42:16.142
Well, we don't have to drink.

42:16.185 --> 42:18.884
Oh, trust me. If you're gonna be
spending any time

42:18.927 --> 42:21.451
with me at all,
you are gonna need a drink.

42:21.495 --> 42:22.888
I have that on good authority

42:22.931 --> 42:25.543
from a great
many women.[laughs]

42:28.023 --> 42:31.244
Well, don't look now, but...

42:31.287 --> 42:34.377
I just might call you.

42:37.032 --> 42:39.513
Don't you threaten me,
young lady.[laughs]
