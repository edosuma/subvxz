<i>Hurry and hide.</i>

00:42.010 --> 00:43.850
<i>He can't find you.</i>

00:44.800 --> 00:48.000
<i>Be careful they don't find you.</i>

01:01.660 --> 01:17.070
~ <i>You'd better hide well.
Be careful or your hair will show.</i> ~

01:17.070 --> 01:19.590

Chan Ho! Seong Chan Ho!

02:36.380 --> 02:38.560
What are you doing in here?

02:38.790 --> 02:41.200
Playing hide-and-seek.

02:41.330 --> 02:43.290
Hide-and-seek?

02:44.470 --> 02:46.040
With whom?

03:01.420 --> 03:04.150
Oh no! Seong Chan Ho!

03:10.080 --> 03:13.420
Chan Ho!

03:16.820 --> 03:18.600
Are you here?

03:18.930 --> 03:21.780
Chan Ho, answer us!

03:22.600 --> 03:26.040
Chan Ho?
Chan Ho.

03:29.570 --> 03:31.410
Why doesn't it work?

03:31.410 --> 03:32.870
Chan Ho!

03:32.870 --> 03:35.000
- Chan Ho.
- Are you here?

03:37.530 --> 03:39.240
Chan Ho, where are you?

03:39.250 --> 03:40.530
Wait.

03:42.530 --> 03:45.830
Chan Ho, are you here?

03:48.740 --> 03:50.990
Are you here?

03:53.010 --> 03:54.120
- Chan Ho!
- Chan Ho.

03:54.150 --> 03:56.870
Where did you go?
Mommy was so worried!

05:10.440 --> 05:10.510

05:10.510 --> 05:12.180
Ha Yun seonbae!

05:12.180 --> 05:14.470
-=Episode 5: "Pinwheel"=-

05:15.200 --> 05:16.670
You're here?

05:16.950 --> 05:20.620
Oh, wahoo! You're just in time.

05:20.940 --> 05:22.670
It's so exciting!

05:23.290 --> 05:25.490
You must have had to wait.

05:25.490 --> 05:27.320
Should I go buy popcorn
and cola?

05:27.320 --> 05:29.530
No.

05:29.530 --> 05:32.830
I brought stuff to eat.

05:32.830 --> 05:35.400
Let's take a photo.

05:53.750 --> 05:55.580
<i>Ha Yun!</i>

05:57.790 --> 05:59.990
As usual, Detective Jeong
knows what's best.

05:59.990 --> 06:02.930
<i>That people like us have
boring lives.</i>

06:02.930 --> 06:07.700
Like this, we must work to
build relationships.

06:07.700 --> 06:13.570
<i>With you young people here,
I didn't know if I'd be in the way.</i>

06:13.570 --> 06:16.510
You were probably at home
cooking ramyeon,

06:16.510 --> 06:22.380
living quietly like a wild goose
father, so you came running
when you heard the news.

06:22.750 --> 06:23.850
No.

06:23.850 --> 06:28.980
If our team leader didn't come,
I'd be very bored.

06:34.860 --> 06:38.160
Hey, that boy's manners...

06:38.530 --> 06:41.830
Why are there so many kids?
What day is it?

06:41.830 --> 06:42.930
Detective Jeong.

06:42.930 --> 06:45.500
What do you want to watch?
Have you decided?

06:45.500 --> 06:48.070
Action, melodrama, or...

06:48.070 --> 06:50.640
maybe erotic?

06:50.640 --> 06:52.110
That one.

06:52.840 --> 06:54.310
Detective Jeong.

06:54.310 --> 06:57.250
Can we talk for a minute?

07:05.320 --> 07:07.520
Hey, you kids!

07:10.830 --> 07:12.290
What's this?

07:12.290 --> 07:14.860
Why did she bring so much
to eat?

07:14.860 --> 07:16.700
Hey, high school student.

07:16.700 --> 07:18.530
You're really hopeless.

07:18.530 --> 07:19.640
Me?

07:19.640 --> 07:22.940
Who are you trying to...

07:24.410 --> 07:26.240
Oh, an idol.

07:26.240 --> 07:28.440
An idol? Where? Where?

07:28.440 --> 07:29.910
Just look at that.

07:29.910 --> 07:32.110
You really are Crazy Ghost.

07:32.110 --> 07:33.950
You know what bait to use.

07:33.950 --> 07:35.780
I guess you really are hopeless.

07:35.780 --> 07:39.090
After the movie, come with me.

07:39.090 --> 07:40.920
Wait right there.

07:42.020 --> 07:43.490
Oh, Baek Seung Chan.

07:43.490 --> 07:46.060
It's been a long time.

07:46.060 --> 07:49.730
Let's go watch the movie.
Watch the movie. Let's go.

07:49.730 --> 07:51.930
What? Right now?

07:59.640 --> 08:02.950
Don't overdo it. You'll get drunk.

08:02.950 --> 08:04.050
I'm prepared.

08:04.050 --> 08:07.350
I'm not going home today
without getting drunk.

08:13.590 --> 08:14.690
How about it?

08:14.690 --> 08:16.530
You don't have a girlfriend?

08:16.530 --> 08:19.460
You should be settling down.

08:19.460 --> 08:21.300
Married, my butt.

08:21.300 --> 08:23.130
Look at this jerk.

08:23.130 --> 08:25.330
Other people are suffering in
marriage.

08:25.330 --> 08:28.270
Why should you be enjoying
your happiness alone?

08:28.270 --> 08:33.780
I'm going to think of some way to
be sure you get married within
the year.

08:33.860 --> 08:36.150
Should I tell your wife you'll
be busy?

08:36.159 --> 08:39.280
Hey, a cop shouldn't do this.

08:39.280 --> 08:41.480
It's attempted murder.

08:44.049 --> 08:48.090
Is Eun Ju already 4 years old?

08:48.090 --> 08:51.030
Do you know something?

08:51.030 --> 08:56.170
In the orphanage, I thought we
were so miserable.

08:56.170 --> 08:58.000
But now that I think about it,

08:58.000 --> 09:01.670
we were even beyond miserable.

09:01.670 --> 09:03.870
You should switch to soda.

09:03.870 --> 09:08.280
Why are you suddenly bringing
up things in the past?

09:08.280 --> 09:10.480
Cheo Yong.

09:10.480 --> 09:12.310
Just in case...

09:14.520 --> 09:15.620
Just a moment.

09:20.390 --> 09:21.490
<i>Yes.</i>

09:46.080 --> 09:47.180
Is something wrong?

09:47.180 --> 09:49.390
No. Nothing's wrong.

09:49.390 --> 09:52.320
I have to go soon.
The boss is looking for me.

09:52.320 --> 09:54.890
So where did we leave off?

09:54.890 --> 09:56.360
Pour me one more.

09:56.360 --> 09:58.560
Oh, right!

09:59.290 --> 10:02.230
We shouldn't live like this.

10:02.230 --> 10:04.070
Trying to please our boss,

10:04.070 --> 10:05.900
and kissing butts of officials.

10:05.900 --> 10:07.370
We should at least live like humans.

10:07.370 --> 10:09.200
What's going on?

10:09.200 --> 10:11.410
Do me a favor and just say it.

10:11.410 --> 10:14.340
Don't keep talking in circles.

10:14.340 --> 10:15.810
A favor?

10:15.810 --> 10:17.280
Me?

10:17.280 --> 10:19.850
I'm with the Seonhyeon News,
Baek Seung Chan.

10:19.850 --> 10:23.150
A mere detective dares to ask me?

10:23.890 --> 10:25.350
Let's go.

10:26.820 --> 10:28.290
Ajumma!

10:45.540 --> 10:47.380
After I saw that movie, "Dreaming,"

10:47.380 --> 10:49.950
I'm a ghost, but I dreamed
of ghosts.

10:49.950 --> 10:52.880
I'm really scared.

10:53.620 --> 10:54.720
Come here.

10:54.720 --> 10:56.920
Relax. Relax. Relax.

10:56.920 --> 10:59.490
I didn't even tell you yet.

10:59.490 --> 11:00.590
Fine.

11:00.590 --> 11:03.890
I understand. Come over here.

11:03.890 --> 11:04.630
<i>Come here.</i>

11:04.990 --> 11:06.830
Just once a week!

11:06.830 --> 11:08.300
And for only half a day.

11:08.300 --> 11:11.600
Is that really so much to ask?

11:11.600 --> 11:13.440
Who asked?

11:13.440 --> 11:16.000
There's nothing you're
afraid of now?

11:16.000 --> 11:16.740
Yeah.

11:16.740 --> 11:21.140
Whether alive or dead, I'm
afraid of... ghosts.

11:25.180 --> 11:27.750
What should I do with her?

11:27.750 --> 11:29.640
Oh, seriously.

11:33.620 --> 11:35.910
Yes, Yun Cheo Yong.

12:23.700 --> 12:28.080
I heard it was drunk driving.
Is that true?

12:28.160 --> 12:32.630
I don't really know what
happened either.

12:34.180 --> 12:38.780
<i>He's someone who never touched
a drop of alcohol. </i>

12:39.320 --> 12:41.160
<i>That time,</i>

12:41.160 --> 12:46.460
<i>where was he going that he
ended up here?</i>

12:46.660 --> 12:48.840
Our poor Eun Ju...

12:49.690 --> 12:52.550
What should I do?

13:20.800 --> 13:23.000
This neighborhood doesn't have
any CCTV cameras?

13:23.000 --> 13:24.100
That's right.

13:24.680 --> 13:27.750
The black box was also melted.

13:29.240 --> 13:31.440
I understand how you feel,

13:31.440 --> 13:34.010
but we're experts in this field.

13:34.010 --> 13:37.860
There was nothing suspicious
found at the scene.

13:38.410 --> 13:41.720
You saw his blood alcohol level
was 0.21, right?

13:41.720 --> 13:45.020
He was probably so drunk he
wasn't able to stop in time.

13:45.020 --> 13:48.710
None of his effects were found
at the scene.

13:48.860 --> 13:52.340
Even the car body melted, so...

13:52.730 --> 13:54.560
This was strange.

13:54.560 --> 13:59.090
I don't know why, but this
photo didn't melt.

14:04.470 --> 14:06.680
-=Gwangju, Gyeonggi-do=-

14:14.750 --> 14:18.340
<i>At first, it was every 8 or 9 days.</i>

14:19.890 --> 14:22.820
Lately, it was twice in a week.

14:22.820 --> 14:25.760
The possession time is
about 5 or 6 hours.

14:25.760 --> 14:30.270
The place where it happens is
usually the office.

14:34.200 --> 14:35.300
What?

14:35.300 --> 14:37.700
Is she looking at me?

14:43.410 --> 14:44.980
Oh my god.

14:45.700 --> 14:47.910
I knew she wouldn't be easy.

14:48.020 --> 14:50.260
I have to be more careful.

14:50.720 --> 14:51.450
<i>Hey.</i>

14:51.530 --> 14:54.230
Why has Yun Cheo Yong been
missing all day?

14:54.240 --> 14:59.880
That's for sure. He was just
outside putting on a show. I have
no idea what he's doing.

15:04.610 --> 15:06.870
This was originally an orphanage.

15:06.870 --> 15:09.810
After several children died in an
accident, they moved away.

15:09.810 --> 15:11.970
Maybe the feng shui is bad.

15:12.520 --> 15:15.220
You can go inside and look.

15:35.080 --> 15:38.060
<i>Hide. Someone's coming.</i>

15:38.280 --> 15:39.900
<i>He can't find us.</i>

15:39.900 --> 15:41.000
<i>How about over there?</i>

15:41.000 --> 15:42.840
<i>He could find us there easily.</i>

15:42.840 --> 15:46.140
<i>No. That place isn't good.</i>

15:46.140 --> 15:50.180
<i>Don't laugh or he'll find us. </i>

17:51.670 --> 17:54.970
Who are you? What are all of
you doing here?

18:24.330 --> 18:27.640
The story Seung Chan was
investigating, I'm taking it over.

18:27.640 --> 18:30.210
Leave it and I'll finish it!

18:30.210 --> 18:32.410
Move! Who do you think you are?

18:32.410 --> 18:34.240
Seonbae died one day ago.

18:34.240 --> 18:35.710
Aren't you going too far?

18:35.710 --> 18:39.010
You have something to hide,
isn't that it?

18:39.010 --> 18:42.320
Bastard, you dare say that to me?

18:43.050 --> 18:44.150
You...

18:44.150 --> 18:45.620
are mourning, so I'll let it go.

18:45.620 --> 18:47.460
But just wait until later.

18:47.460 --> 18:48.920
What? Throw him out.

18:48.920 --> 18:50.030
Wait.

18:50.030 --> 18:51.490
Let go!

18:51.490 --> 18:53.700
<i>That's enough!</i>

18:55.530 --> 18:57.000
Who are you?

18:57.000 --> 18:58.470
Police.

19:01.040 --> 19:01.770
What about it?

19:01.770 --> 19:05.810
I'm investigating a case,
so please cooperate.

19:05.810 --> 19:07.640
Investigating what?

19:07.640 --> 19:09.840
Do you have a warrant?

19:09.840 --> 19:13.520
Do you know where you are?
You're abusing your authority...

19:14.980 --> 19:17.190
Let go! What do you think
you're doing?

19:17.190 --> 19:20.120
Why are you just standing there?

19:23.790 --> 19:25.260
<i>Call someone!</i>

19:25.260 --> 19:27.100
Call the police!

19:27.100 --> 19:28.930
A cop is beating someone!

19:28.930 --> 19:30.030
Seonbae.

19:30.030 --> 19:33.700
These have to be sorted
according to number.

19:33.700 --> 19:35.170
And according to size.

19:35.170 --> 19:36.640
I'm sorry.

19:36.640 --> 19:40.310
<i>Detective Han, your desk
is so messy!</i>

19:40.310 --> 19:43.610
How can you work in this mess?
Clean up and be more efficient.

19:43.610 --> 19:49.120
We don't have a case, but isn't
this still mentally exhausting?

19:49.120 --> 19:51.690
Yes. You probably feel that way
because you're so old.

19:51.690 --> 19:56.090
Either take on a case, or else
get busy and think of something!

19:56.090 --> 20:00.130
It's so noisy, I can't concentrate.
I can't concentrate.

20:02.330 --> 20:05.270
You can see that and still dare
to complain like this?

20:05.270 --> 20:08.570
Anyway, where is Yun Cheo Yong
and what is he doing?

20:08.570 --> 20:10.410
Why doesn't he have to be here?

20:10.410 --> 20:15.180
As a colleague, he should be
here to share this pain with us.

20:15.180 --> 20:18.110
If we could at least get a call,

20:18.110 --> 20:22.150
I might find an excuse to go
out for a while.

20:26.920 --> 20:29.120
I'll get it! I'll get it!

20:29.860 --> 20:33.900
Yes, Special Case Investigation
Team, Han Tae Gyeong.

20:33.900 --> 20:35.730
What do you mean by that?

20:35.730 --> 20:39.030
Detective Yun is being held
by the police?

20:39.030 --> 20:40.140
What?

20:42.700 --> 20:47.110
I mean, isn't doing this to a
fellow detective ridiculous?

20:47.110 --> 20:51.880
The other party won't settle,
so neither can I.

20:51.880 --> 20:54.820
Old habits die hard. Are they
coming out again?

20:54.820 --> 20:55.550
That's right.

20:55.550 --> 21:01.790
It used to be fine, but these days
with everything transparent,
nothing gets resolved.

21:01.790 --> 21:05.460
He's not someone who is
abusive to people.

21:05.460 --> 21:07.660
I will discipline him and he won't
do anything like this...

21:07.660 --> 21:09.130
But my arm...

21:09.130 --> 21:10.600
Look at this.

21:10.600 --> 21:12.800
I still can barely move it!

21:12.800 --> 21:16.840
Just now it seemed like your
range of motion was pretty good.

21:16.840 --> 21:20.510
I'll get a medical diagnosis!
You just wait and see!

21:20.510 --> 21:26.010
Police trash, dare to go around
beating people in the press.

21:26.010 --> 21:28.580
Police trash?

21:28.580 --> 21:35.560
You just declared war on us
police trash, right?

21:37.390 --> 21:39.590
You want a head-on conflict, right?

21:39.590 --> 21:40.700
No...

21:40.700 --> 21:44.000
that's not exactly what I meant.

21:45.470 --> 21:47.300
Do you know what they call me?

21:47.300 --> 21:48.400
Pitbull.

21:48.400 --> 21:52.440
Once I bite, whether I get hit
or whether I die, I won't let go.

21:52.440 --> 21:55.740
Win or lose, no matter what
happens....

21:55.740 --> 21:58.680
Just let it go this once.

22:08.960 --> 22:09.690
Let's go.

22:10.430 --> 22:11.530
I'm sorry.

22:12.630 --> 22:14.460
It's all right.

22:14.460 --> 22:17.030
Of course we should look out
for each other.

22:17.030 --> 22:18.130
Come on.

22:18.500 --> 22:19.970
Team leader, way to go!

22:19.970 --> 22:22.540
Team leader, you were so cool
just now.

22:22.540 --> 22:25.110
The team leader got the
nickname of Pitbull,

22:25.110 --> 22:27.310
because he was the mutt of the
Wide Area Search Team.

22:27.310 --> 22:28.410
Like a stray mutt,

22:28.410 --> 22:30.980
the cases other people dropped,
he brought back to gnaw on.

22:30.980 --> 22:33.550
How long are you going
to talk about that stuff?

22:33.550 --> 22:35.750
But will this really be okay?

22:35.750 --> 22:37.950
Just now I heard that bureau
chief on the phone.

22:37.950 --> 22:40.520
He seems unusually determined.

22:40.520 --> 22:42.720
Is that so?

22:42.720 --> 22:44.560
Really?

22:44.560 --> 22:45.660
What did he say?

22:45.660 --> 22:48.600
He didn't mention me, did he?

22:48.600 --> 22:50.430
What did he say?

22:50.430 --> 22:55.570
He really is a Pitbull. He bites
and he won't let go. Yeah.

22:55.570 --> 22:57.410
What did he say?

22:57.410 --> 22:59.240
<i>Tell me from the beginning.</i>

22:59.240 --> 23:01.810
What are you doing?
Go catch up to them.

23:01.810 --> 23:04.380
You're just asking for it.

23:13.190 --> 23:16.860
Wow. What's wrong with him?

23:18.690 --> 23:20.160
<i>No wonder.</i>

23:20.160 --> 23:23.830
This was not a typical day.

23:24.080 --> 23:25.600
So,

23:26.620 --> 23:28.970
your friend died in an
unusual accident.

23:28.970 --> 23:34.540
Tracking these clues led you to
seeing these dead children, right?

23:36.310 --> 23:42.120
Yun seonbae, when all this
happened, why didn't you say
anything to us?

23:45.420 --> 23:46.660
Excuse me.

23:57.970 --> 24:00.170
<i>Do you think you'll still be able
to be a reporter?</i>

24:00.170 --> 24:02.920
<i>Who are you trying to shame?</i>

24:03.840 --> 24:07.140
I don't know what story seonbae
was investigating,

24:07.140 --> 24:10.810
but only death would stop him.

24:11.910 --> 24:13.350
<i>Do it right.</i>

24:18.150 --> 24:22.190
<i>What story are you working on
anyway?</i>

24:22.190 --> 24:26.230
<i>You have time to worry about
other people's business now?</i>

24:26.230 --> 24:28.800
<i>Do well on your own work.</i>

24:30.630 --> 24:36.500
Maybe he thought if he told me,
I might also be in danger.

24:52.650 --> 24:54.860
<i>Seonbae always said,</i>

24:54.860 --> 24:58.160
<i>never try to become Goliath.</i>

24:58.160 --> 25:04.030
Instead, stand in David's
position and throw stones.

25:04.030 --> 25:06.530
That's being a reporter.

25:12.840 --> 25:15.040
-=Hangwang Orphanage=-

25:24.590 --> 25:26.420
<i>Look at this jerk.</i>

25:26.420 --> 25:28.620
<i>Other people are suffering in
marriage.</i>

25:28.620 --> 25:31.930
<i>Why should you be enjoying
your happiness alone?</i>

25:31.930 --> 25:36.330
<i>I'm going to think of some way to
be sure you get married within
the year.</i>

25:36.330 --> 25:38.900
<i>Later on, don't have any daughters.</i>

25:38.900 --> 25:42.570
<i>I'm so popular at home,
it makes me nervous.</i>

25:42.570 --> 25:46.610
<i>I even wake up when I'm
half asleep.</i>

25:52.110 --> 25:58.720
That's right. Sometimes you
need to be alone.

26:34.690 --> 26:36.160
Who are you?

27:11.030 --> 27:13.960
The Hangwang Orphanage in
Gwangju, after a fire 2 years ago,

27:13.960 --> 27:15.800
they moved to Yongin,

27:15.800 --> 27:16.900
into a townhouse.

27:16.900 --> 27:19.830
<i>Back then, that fire killed
7 children.</i>

27:19.830 --> 27:21.300
One was Min Ji Seong.

27:21.300 --> 27:22.040
What about Gim Han Eul?

27:22.040 --> 27:24.970
He was adopted after the
orphanage moved to Yongin.

27:24.970 --> 27:27.180
But 6 months later, he died.

27:27.180 --> 27:29.740
It really does sound suspicious.

27:29.740 --> 27:33.410
<i>It would be strange if there was
an accident, or if they adopted a
sick child.</i>

27:33.410 --> 27:35.980
What did you find out about the
guy who attacked Cheo Yong?

27:35.980 --> 27:38.190
There weren't any CCTV cameras,

27:38.190 --> 27:42.590
and there were no clues left
behind regarding his identity.

27:44.790 --> 27:48.100
Considering all this, we're officially
starting an investigation.

27:48.100 --> 27:53.970
Both of you go to the orphanage.
Find out what Reporter Baek was
investigating.

27:53.970 --> 27:57.640
You kids come with me to check
out the adoptive family.

27:57.640 --> 27:58.370
Let's move.

27:58.370 --> 27:59.470
Yes.

28:09.380 --> 28:11.590
You're okay, aren't you?

28:11.590 --> 28:15.620
Do you need me to do anything?
Just ask.

28:33.980 --> 28:36.180
I am Yang Hyeon Mu.

28:38.380 --> 28:42.420
E & K Company.

28:42.420 --> 28:43.890
Yes.

28:44.990 --> 28:47.190
To get straight to the point,

28:47.190 --> 28:54.530
please stop your team from
investigating this case.

28:55.630 --> 29:01.140
To get to the point, I have no
idea what you're talking about.

29:01.140 --> 29:04.440
Corporate image is everything.

29:04.440 --> 29:08.480
But even a hint of rumor can
damage that image.

29:08.480 --> 29:14.720
Our team's investigation might
possibly damage your corporate
image, is that so?

29:14.720 --> 29:16.920
So just forget the whole thing.

29:16.920 --> 29:19.490
You're very understanding.

29:22.060 --> 29:23.890
At least,

29:24.630 --> 29:30.130
you should know that to ask
someone like me to interfere is
rather useless.

29:30.130 --> 29:34.540
Asking someone like you to
interfere is not useless.

29:34.540 --> 29:35.270
Terms.

29:35.270 --> 29:39.310
We just need the proper terms,
right?

29:42.500 --> 29:47.210
If you cut short the investigation,
I will give you the other half.

29:59.130 --> 30:01.960
These terms are very attractive.

30:06.710 --> 30:12.490
My kids are very headstrong
and reckless.

30:13.070 --> 30:15.280
Rather than being skinned
alive by them,

30:15.280 --> 30:18.580
it would be less bothersome to
just let them investigate you.

30:18.580 --> 30:21.520
You understand, right?

30:21.520 --> 30:25.550
A lot of people would accept
these terms.

30:25.550 --> 30:28.860
You should consider it carefully.

30:28.860 --> 30:30.690
You...

30:31.430 --> 30:35.830
must have already investigated
me, right?

30:36.930 --> 30:42.520
Thanks to you, I now know that
my kids are on the right track.

30:43.170 --> 30:49.120
Since you've provided the
intelligence, I'll take care of the
bill today.

30:51.250 --> 30:53.450
You never touched your
chopsticks, so we'll forget it
today.

30:53.450 --> 31:00.420
But later, when you're writing out
your statement, be sure to eat.

31:28.320 --> 31:31.250
I checked with the Ministry of
Health and Welfare.

31:31.250 --> 31:32.720
I didn't find anything suspicious.

31:32.720 --> 31:37.120
Nobody has made a report of
child abuse.

31:46.670 --> 31:48.140
Why are you crying?

31:48.140 --> 31:51.070
They hide where I can't find them,

31:51.070 --> 31:53.640
I always have to look for them.

31:53.640 --> 31:55.110
<i>Should I help you?</i>

31:55.110 --> 31:59.150
Detective Jeong, we don't have time.

32:07.590 --> 32:11.260
Ajussi, please help me look.

32:11.990 --> 32:15.660
I'll help you look, too.
Police don't only find bad guys.

32:15.660 --> 32:17.500
I'm a police officer.

32:19.700 --> 32:22.640
Please help me find them.

32:24.840 --> 32:25.940
What's your name?

32:25.940 --> 32:28.880
Min Ji Yun. I'm 7 years old.

32:28.880 --> 32:32.550
May I take a look at your pinwheel?

32:32.550 --> 32:35.480
This is my treasure, so you can't.

32:35.480 --> 32:39.150
It's broken, but my brother
gave it to me.

32:39.370 --> 32:42.980
When my brother comes back,
he'll fix it for me.

32:44.290 --> 32:46.130
Where did your brother go?

32:46.130 --> 32:47.600
What is your brother's name?

32:47.600 --> 32:48.700
Min Ji Seong.

32:48.700 --> 32:52.500
He's not feeling good and is
getting treatment.

32:54.570 --> 32:58.970
You go find everyone with this
eonni, and I'll fix your pinwheel.

32:58.970 --> 33:01.540
That's good, right?

33:13.500 --> 33:16.380
<i>Where did your friends hide?</i>

33:17.320 --> 33:18.430
<i>First of all...</i>

33:18.430 --> 33:21.750
If it were you, think about
where you would hide.

33:22.460 --> 33:25.560
Over there it's too open and
they'd find you easily, right?

33:25.600 --> 33:29.170
Over there is too high, so you
can't hide there.

33:31.710 --> 33:34.870
That place is too small,
so not there, right?

33:35.310 --> 33:36.410
In that case,

33:36.410 --> 33:39.570
let's go see if there's a place
that's different than usual.

33:43.750 --> 33:48.520
I feel like that plastic tub
shouldn't be upside down.

33:48.520 --> 33:49.810
That's right!

33:54.400 --> 33:55.880
I found you!

33:56.230 --> 33:57.700
You broke the rules.

33:57.700 --> 33:59.530
She helped you find me!

33:59.530 --> 34:02.470
No she didn't. I found you myself.

34:02.470 --> 34:04.310
Where should I hide that's good?

34:04.310 --> 34:07.500
Tell me a good way to hide.

34:09.440 --> 34:11.639
Right under their noses.

34:11.639 --> 34:15.320
Someplace so obvious, they'd
never look there.

34:15.320 --> 34:17.520
Understand?

34:31.830 --> 34:34.400
Ah, now I remember.

34:34.400 --> 34:37.340
Was it Reporter Baek,
or something like that?

34:37.340 --> 34:39.170
What did he come here about?

34:39.170 --> 34:41.370
I don't know where he heard it,

34:41.370 --> 34:44.310
but he said we had some
management problems.

34:44.310 --> 34:51.250
Finally, he saw our management
was more transparent than most
places.

34:54.960 --> 34:58.260
Do you recognize them?

34:58.260 --> 34:59.730
Yes.

34:59.730 --> 35:01.930
They are Ji Seong and Han Eul.

35:01.930 --> 35:06.330
It's a pity that Ji Seong was
in the fire 2 years ago.

35:06.330 --> 35:10.000
But fortunately, Han Eul was
adopted by someone.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.210
What was the cause of the fire?

35:12.210 --> 35:18.810
The police investigation decided
it was caused by kids playing
with fire.

35:18.810 --> 35:21.750
Han Eul also died very soon
after he was adopted.

35:21.750 --> 35:23.580
Did you know?

35:23.580 --> 35:26.520
Is that true?

35:26.520 --> 35:29.460
<i>He was always a sickly child.</i>

35:29.460 --> 35:33.490
That was his last hope.

35:33.670 --> 35:40.440
In that case, for someone to
specifically adopt a sickly child,

35:40.470 --> 35:43.400
perhaps you know the particular
reason.

35:43.400 --> 35:44.970
I'm not sure.

35:45.240 --> 35:51.480
Although adoption is a fate,
it is the parent and child's fate.

35:51.480 --> 35:55.140
I can only say it is a family
relationship.

36:16.440 --> 36:17.910
This is it, right?

36:18.080 --> 36:19.010
Yes.

36:19.070 --> 36:20.400
Let's go.

36:23.320 --> 36:25.530
Please look at this.

36:32.590 --> 36:36.990
<i>I'm not sure. It's the first
time I've seen this person.</i>

36:37.370 --> 36:38.960
I see.

36:40.140 --> 36:41.400
Should we go?

36:41.400 --> 36:42.280
Yes.

36:48.000 --> 36:49.770
You're here already?

36:49.970 --> 36:52.770
Did you meet with Gim Han Eul's
adoptive parents?

36:52.770 --> 36:55.710
Yes, and I confirmed his death
certificate several times,

36:55.710 --> 36:57.180
but I didn't find anything
suspicious.

36:57.180 --> 36:59.930
There wasn't any extra life
insurance either.

37:01.220 --> 37:05.510
So it apparently wasn't some
kind of insurance scam.

37:06.350 --> 37:11.510
In my opinion, adopting a child
who's always in the hospital,

37:11.900 --> 37:14.950
it seems like we're investigating
innocent people.

37:14.980 --> 37:18.390
Just now, you didn't feel
anything was strange?

37:19.070 --> 37:22.400
They didn't seem like a family
raising children.

37:24.510 --> 37:28.640
Ji Seong. Where are you?

37:29.110 --> 37:31.190
Ji Seong.

37:31.680 --> 37:33.510
<i>Go and see Ji Seong.</i>

37:33.590 --> 37:36.130
<i>If there's anything he wants to say,</i>

37:36.450 --> 37:37.780
<i>go and find out.</i>

37:37.830 --> 37:42.500
Ji Seong! Children!

37:44.670 --> 37:46.360
Don't be like this!

37:46.360 --> 37:48.200
I'm about to cry.

37:48.200 --> 37:52.600
I'm pretty, but I'm also a coward.

37:52.600 --> 37:55.170
Ji Seong.

38:02.140 --> 38:05.080
You're in here.

38:05.450 --> 38:07.280
Found you.

38:12.420 --> 38:15.360
You're Ji Seong, right?

38:20.490 --> 38:29.670
<i>Hey, please open the door!</i>

38:33.710 --> 38:37.380
<i>Hey, Dong Hun. Wake up!</i>

38:37.750 --> 38:41.050
<i>Hey, wake up!</i>

38:41.050 --> 38:47.290
<i>Hey, please open the door!</i>

38:47.290 --> 38:49.490
<i>Hey!</i>

38:50.960 --> 38:54.260
You must have been lonely
and scared.

38:54.260 --> 38:59.400
Are you all waiting for your
mom and dad?

39:04.910 --> 39:07.110
Yes, they will come.

39:07.110 --> 39:10.040
I'm sure they'll come.

39:13.350 --> 39:18.490
But, they won't come here.

39:18.490 --> 39:23.990
They'll meet you in Heaven if
you wait there.

39:23.990 --> 39:29.500
I promise that to all of you.

39:29.500 --> 39:33.900
You can play with your friends
in Heaven.

39:33.900 --> 39:37.940
Your mom and dad will definitely
find you there.

39:37.940 --> 39:41.800
That's why you should go
to Heaven and wait.

40:07.920 --> 40:10.600
Seonbae, what do you think?

40:12.620 --> 40:15.830
There was nothing that seemed
particularly suspicious.

40:16.270 --> 40:19.380
I think the painting that was
hanging on his wall was wrong.

40:19.570 --> 40:20.510
Painting?

40:20.620 --> 40:23.760
It was a painting by the artist,
Lee Jun.

40:24.550 --> 40:26.390
I remember those are very
expensive.

40:26.390 --> 40:28.220
Maybe it's not an original.

40:28.220 --> 40:31.160
I looked carefully.
It didn't look like a copy.

40:31.160 --> 40:35.930
He writes "SAN" in a very unique
way. It's very hard to forge.

40:35.930 --> 40:38.870
An expensive painting.

40:43.640 --> 40:45.470
Ji Yun!

40:48.410 --> 40:49.880
Why are you here?

40:49.880 --> 40:53.910
Where am I?

40:54.280 --> 40:59.220
It's against the rules to go
outside of the orphanage.

41:05.290 --> 41:06.760
We're back.

41:06.760 --> 41:08.130
Come and sit down.

41:12.630 --> 41:13.850
Here.

41:15.940 --> 41:18.510
Yun Cheo Yong, come here.

41:25.480 --> 41:27.310
What are you doing with her?

41:27.310 --> 41:30.200
Why did you bring a child here?

41:30.620 --> 41:35.020
We didn't bring her. I think she
played hide-and-seek in our car.

41:35.020 --> 41:36.490
Hurry and take her back.

41:36.490 --> 41:39.060
No, give them a call first.

41:39.060 --> 41:40.160
<i>She said she's hungry.</i>

41:44.930 --> 41:49.700
Fine. Feed her, then take her
back.

41:50.070 --> 41:53.370
Whatever you want to eat,
just tell me.

41:53.370 --> 41:57.040
Whatever it is, that ajussi will
buy it for you.

41:57.040 --> 41:59.210
Ajussi, thank you.

41:59.610 --> 42:01.080
What would you like?

42:01.080 --> 42:02.920
Sweet potato pizza,

42:02.920 --> 42:05.120
double patty steak burger,

42:05.120 --> 42:09.520
honey butter chicken, black bean
noodles, stone pot beef soup.

42:09.520 --> 42:10.990
<i>Really?</i>

42:10.990 --> 42:12.830
<i>You're so hungry!</i>

42:14.120 --> 42:17.940
Ajussi, come talk to me.

42:27.810 --> 42:31.570
Ji Seong's death wasn't an
accident.

42:32.520 --> 42:37.070
When the fire happened at the
orphanage, they were locked inside.

42:38.610 --> 42:41.320
This was a murder.

42:42.340 --> 42:44.830
<i>I just can't understand.</i>

42:45.340 --> 42:48.160
What did those little children
ever do wrong?

42:48.430 --> 42:50.500
How could they do that?

42:57.970 --> 43:00.170
<i>I'm a police officer.</i>

43:00.170 --> 43:04.210
<i>For eating junk food, I'm going
to arrest you.</i>

43:04.210 --> 43:06.050
Where did you learn that?

43:06.050 --> 43:07.510
This eonni.

43:07.510 --> 43:10.080
Detective Jeong must be happy.

43:10.080 --> 43:14.490
It looks like she has a fan.

43:14.490 --> 43:17.790
But you can't learn her strange
habits.

43:17.790 --> 43:19.990
What strange habits?

43:19.990 --> 43:21.830
Oh, nothing, nothing.

43:21.830 --> 43:23.660
I'm sorry. It was a mistake.

43:26.600 --> 43:28.070
-=Min Ji Seong=-

43:28.440 --> 43:30.270

43:31.000 --> 43:33.570

43:33.570 --> 43:37.610
Is she Ji Seong's little sister?

43:38.350 --> 43:43.120
Ji Yun. Those are police secrets,
so you can't look.

43:43.120 --> 43:44.950
Okay.

43:47.150 --> 43:48.990
Ji Yun.

43:48.990 --> 43:51.190
How do you know the
reporter ajussi?

43:51.190 --> 43:55.230
Reporter ajussi said he'd help
me find my brother.

43:56.330 --> 43:58.170
Liar.

43:58.170 --> 44:01.470
I want you to arrest him.

44:01.470 --> 44:04.400
Instead, I'll help you find him.

44:04.400 --> 44:05.510
Really?

44:05.510 --> 44:08.130
Me too.

44:10.280 --> 44:13.790
With eyes like that, you have no
other choice.

44:14.270 --> 44:16.790
Right. Me too.

44:19.540 --> 44:21.580
<i>Good, good. Eat now.</i>

44:21.690 --> 44:23.930
Try and eat the rest.

44:24.330 --> 44:27.160
<i>Ji Yun! Ji Yun!</i>

44:27.160 --> 44:28.630
What happened?

44:41.480 --> 44:46.250
Eonni. Ajussi.

44:46.250 --> 44:48.450
I'm sorry.

44:48.450 --> 44:50.280
It's all my fault.

44:50.280 --> 44:53.590
No. You didn't do anything wrong.

44:53.590 --> 44:55.420
It's all right.

44:55.420 --> 45:06.800
I was sick, so my brother couldn't
come back. It's all my fault.

45:07.530 --> 45:10.100
<i>You don't want to see the doctor
tomorrow, do you?</i>

45:10.100 --> 45:11.200
<i>Right.</i>

45:11.200 --> 45:13.410
<i>Don't they give you shots at
the hospital?</i>

45:13.410 --> 45:15.980
<i>Then I'll go in your place.</i>

45:15.980 --> 45:18.550
<i>Really?</i>

45:18.550 --> 45:21.480
<i>No. I should just go.</i>

45:21.480 --> 45:24.050
<i>If you have to get a shot,
it will hurt.</i>

45:24.050 --> 45:29.560
<i>No, I'm your big brother,
so I'll be fine. </i>

45:36.530 --> 45:38.000
<i>Why are you still lying down?</i>

45:38.000 --> 45:41.670
<i>Director, I'm sick.</i>

45:44.970 --> 45:47.540
<i>I told you to be sure not to
catch a cold, right?</i>

45:47.540 --> 45:49.380
<i>Director.</i>

45:49.380 --> 45:51.210
<i>I'll go in her place.</i>

45:51.210 --> 45:53.050
<i>Come over here.</i>

45:55.620 --> 45:58.920
<i>Fine. Today you can go.</i>

45:58.920 --> 46:01.490
<i>Hurry and come out.</i>

46:15.800 --> 46:18.740
<i>Oppa, did it hurt?</i>

46:18.740 --> 46:19.470
<i>No.</i>

46:19.470 --> 46:21.680
<i>It didn't hurt even a little bit.</i>

46:21.680 --> 46:23.140
<i>You're lying.</i>

46:23.140 --> 46:25.350
<i>Next time, I will go. </i>

46:25.350 --> 46:29.380
<i>No. Next time and the time after
that, I will go. </i>

46:29.380 --> 46:34.520
<i>Even if I'm not here, you have
to pretend to be sick. </i>

46:34.520 --> 46:38.560
<i>You have to act like when you
have a fever, understand?</i>

46:38.560 --> 46:40.760
<i>Promise?</i>

46:42.230 --> 46:46.630
I made a promise to my brother.

46:47.370 --> 46:54.340
If I get sick too, maybe I can
see my brother.

46:55.440 --> 47:03.150
I didn't keep my promise, so my
brother never came back.

47:03.520 --> 47:07.550
Ji Yun! Ji Yun!

47:07.920 --> 47:10.490
Ji Yun!

47:11.960 --> 47:14.160
If your child has diabetes,

47:14.160 --> 47:16.730
and if they don't get their
insulin injection on time,

47:16.730 --> 47:19.670
their blood sugar becomes low
and they get sick like this.

47:19.670 --> 47:22.970
Is her condition very serious?

47:22.970 --> 47:27.740
If it was purely childhood diabetes,
it wouldn't be like this.

47:27.740 --> 47:34.350
Anyway, there is acute muscle
inflammation.

47:36.180 --> 47:39.850
Where? Where? Where?

47:42.060 --> 47:43.520
Ji Yun!

47:43.520 --> 47:46.090
Just what have you done to
this child?

47:46.090 --> 47:47.930
Just who are you to be shouting
at me?

47:47.930 --> 47:48.660
Tell me!

47:48.660 --> 47:49.400
Seonbae!

47:49.400 --> 47:50.500

47:50.500 --> 47:52.510
Come to your senses!

48:00.770 --> 48:03.710
Sit right there.

48:05.910 --> 48:09.220
Are you really going to keep
doing this?

48:17.290 --> 48:20.590
If anything happens, I want
you to call me.

48:20.590 --> 48:22.800

I am Central District Special

49:24.460 --> 49:29.230
Please close your current
investigation.

49:29.960 --> 49:36.570
Wow. I never expected you to
start so quickly.

49:38.710 --> 49:43.250
You made the wrong move.
Arousing his suspicion.

49:43.250 --> 49:47.950
I say that because I'm concerned
your team will screw up our case.

49:48.380 --> 49:52.620
Our Special Investigation team
will screw up your investigation.

49:53.450 --> 49:59.330
Gathering several exceptional
detectives together has been
extremely successful,

49:59.330 --> 50:04.100
but solving the case this time
doesn't depend on the ability
of the police.

50:04.100 --> 50:07.400
The limitations are very clear.

50:12.170 --> 50:14.740
-=A serial killer suspect may be
released due to lack of evidence=-

50:14.740 --> 50:20.610
Now it seems Han Gyu Hyeong
isn't the only Devil's lawyer.

50:20.610 --> 50:23.550
Because they can't handle
lawyers like that,

50:23.920 --> 50:31.260
the problem is with a bunch of
incompetent prosecutors who let
human trash back into the world.

50:31.260 --> 50:35.300
<i>Hangwang Orphanage depends
on support from E & K Company.</i>

50:35.300 --> 50:38.600
<i>Their financial affairs appear
very clean.</i>

50:38.600 --> 50:41.530
Expensive apartment and
big car.

50:41.530 --> 50:44.470
How does an orphanage director
spend money so freely?

50:44.470 --> 50:46.670
His bank account doesn't show
substantial financial resources.

50:46.670 --> 50:48.510
These were cash transactions.

50:48.510 --> 50:52.550
The cause of death was not
unusual, but there was something
strange about the doctor.

50:52.550 --> 50:54.750
The child was already dead when
he was sent to the ER.

50:54.750 --> 51:00.040
But it wasn't an emergency room
doctor, but a pediatrician who
made the diagnosis.

All are directly or indirectly
related to E & K Company.

This same pattern shows up all
over the country.

51:29.620 --> 51:32.920
Just what kind of case are you
working on?

51:34.390 --> 51:37.320
Well, I guess...

51:37.320 --> 51:40.990
it seems we've uncovered a
major case.

51:41.150 --> 51:45.260
We're not exactly sure what
kind of case it is yet.

51:45.270 --> 51:46.300
I'm sorry.

51:46.320 --> 51:48.140
No, you've done well.

51:48.330 --> 51:52.010
Everywhere I go, they tell me
to stop investigating.

51:52.010 --> 51:54.570
You don't know what it is,
but you've done well.

51:54.570 --> 52:01.750
I don't know what you're
investigating, but you've done
great!

52:03.020 --> 52:05.950
But you know, like I said,

52:05.950 --> 52:07.420
since we're still not sure....

52:07.420 --> 52:08.520
Forget it.

52:11.460 --> 52:15.860
You know my character. For now,
the higher-ups can look at my face.

52:15.860 --> 52:18.060
But it can't drag on for too long.

52:18.060 --> 52:20.630
If there's someone you need to
investigate, do it aggressively.

52:20.630 --> 52:23.940
Tell me something definite,
got it?

52:23.940 --> 52:26.140
Yes, I understand.

First of all...

-= E & K Company =-

52:31.640 --> 52:33.110
start investigating here.

52:33.480 --> 52:38.070
Now, if any side effects occur,
we found the right solution. We
got that covered.

52:38.070 --> 52:41.910
All we have to do is write out a
warning statement in the
supplementation,

52:41.910 --> 52:44.450
and we're ready for the launch.

52:44.690 --> 52:45.730
But,

52:46.140 --> 52:51.030
are you aware of the significance
of this multi-vaccine project for
Albatross?

52:51.070 --> 52:52.040
Yes.

52:52.200 --> 52:53.780
Isn't it wonderful?

52:54.030 --> 52:59.540
Korea is a significant foothold for
the development of the world
market, as well as a hub for Asia.

52:59.540 --> 53:03.940
If this all works out, we make
tens of billions of dollars.

53:03.940 --> 53:07.250
Yes, I'm aware of this.

53:07.250 --> 53:11.650
So if you're aware of that,
why didn't you do a good job?

53:12.390 --> 53:18.260
Don't worry. The police will find
evidence never. Never.

53:18.260 --> 53:20.830
Well, if the police trace you,

53:20.830 --> 53:23.760
you will never see that beautiful
scenery again.

53:24.000 --> 53:29.270
Yes, sir. I will take care of this.

53:29.270 --> 53:31.470
You'd better take care of it.

53:33.310 --> 53:35.140
<i>Name, Yang Hyeon Mu.</i>

53:35.140 --> 53:38.810
He's a Korean-American, currently
president of E & K Company.

53:38.810 --> 53:43.950
Before that, he worked for a
global pharmaceutical company,
Albatross.

53:44.680 --> 53:49.460
E & K was registered in 2011 as
a foreign medical equipment
import company.

53:49.460 --> 53:52.760
After one or two imports of
cheap medical equipment,

53:52.760 --> 53:55.330
their last import was in 2012.

53:55.330 --> 53:57.900
But if the company has no
income,

53:57.900 --> 54:01.570
with what money are they
sponsoring an orphanage and
bribing doctors?

54:01.570 --> 54:03.770
Are they relying on adoptive
parents to pay for children?

54:03.770 --> 54:07.070
More than that, isn't why they're
doing it more important?

54:07.070 --> 54:13.680
E & K Company is only...
a paper company.

54:13.680 --> 54:15.880
On tracking their capital flow,

54:16.620 --> 54:22.120
From the Cayman Islands, there
are huge amounts of money
flowing into Lewis holding company.

54:22.120 --> 54:24.690
That one is also a paper company.

54:24.690 --> 54:31.660
With such a complicated system,
what are they trying to hide?

54:31.660 --> 54:34.230
Before Yang Hyeon Mu came
to South Korea,

54:34.230 --> 54:38.110
He lived in Somalia and Brazil
for quite a long time.

54:39.010 --> 54:42.310
When the Albatross company
produced a test vaccine,

54:42.310 --> 54:47.080
there was suspicion they were
using children for illegal clinical
trials.

54:47.080 --> 54:49.280
Illegal clinical trials?

54:49.280 --> 54:51.480
Then sponsoring the orphanage...

54:51.480 --> 54:53.690
So to sum it all up,

54:53.690 --> 54:56.990
Albatross and the paper company,
E & K,

54:56.990 --> 54:58.830
are sponsoring a national
orphanage,

54:58.830 --> 55:01.390
while using the children for
illegal clinical trials.

55:01.390 --> 55:03.600
The children who suffer side
effects from the treatment

55:03.600 --> 55:05.430
either die in some type of
accident,

55:05.430 --> 55:08.740
or die of an illness following
their adoption.

55:09.840 --> 55:14.610
If Reporter Baek Seung Chan
found out about this,

55:14.610 --> 55:16.440
they may have silenced him.

55:16.440 --> 55:17.910
<i>Wait, wait.</i>

55:17.910 --> 55:22.680
In Somalia and Brazil, why did
the suspicion go away?

55:22.820 --> 55:26.810
Because all of the evidence
disappeared.

55:27.090 --> 55:31.120
Including the relevant staff...
and the children.

Ajussi!

59:45.850 --> 59:47.680
Ajussi.

59:47.680 --> 59:48.780
Wake up.

59:48.780 --> 59:50.980
Ajussi!

01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:01.630
Ajussi.

01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:04.200
Wake up.

01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:06.030
Ajussi!

01:00:06.770 --> 01:00:10.070
You should go to the hospital first.

01:00:10.070 --> 01:00:12.640
Ajussi, do you think you're
immortal?

01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:17.410
Don't be like this. Go get
checked at the hospital!

01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:21.810
So, E & K didn't have any people
there.

01:00:21.810 --> 01:00:24.020
I only saw one desk inside.

01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:26.590
The adoptive family also left in
a hurry without a trace.

01:00:26.590 --> 01:00:28.420
The same with the doctor.

01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:29.890
<i>He just suddenly disappeared.</i>

01:00:29.890 --> 01:00:33.190
Apply for a travel restriction on
everyone named in the arrest
warrant.

01:00:33.260 --> 01:00:37.230
Get support from the District
Office to look for our witnesses.

01:01:32.650 --> 01:01:34.120
I don't think they're here.

01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:37.500
I walked around but didn't
find anything.

01:01:58.710 --> 01:02:01.650
<i>This is my treasure, so you can't.</i>

01:02:01.650 --> 01:02:05.680
<i>It's broken, but my brother
gave it to me.</i>

01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:09.360
<i>When my brother comes back,
he'll fix it for me.</i>

01:02:18.990 --> 01:02:21.580
Ajussi, this...

01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:37.950
The arrest warrant came out.

01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:44.590
<i>Let's go!</i>

01:02:48.630 --> 01:02:50.100
Wait a minute!

01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:51.200
I know where the children are!

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:53.030
At the research institute!

01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:15.420
If you want to live, you'd
better stop.

01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:13.780
You're in charge of it.

01:04:13.780 --> 01:04:15.980
Bastard.

01:04:43.510 --> 01:04:44.610
Get these guys.

01:04:44.610 --> 01:04:46.080
Yes!

01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:49.750
This way.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.810
<i>You son of a bitch.</i>

01:05:15.810 --> 01:05:19.850
Why do you have to be so
damn annoying?

01:05:19.850 --> 01:05:22.050
<i>Do you need money?</i>

01:05:22.050 --> 01:05:25.350
How about $20,000,000?

01:05:26.090 --> 01:05:31.590
I'll give you more money than
you can spend in your lifetime!

01:05:35.260 --> 01:05:37.460
What's your problem?

01:06:09.030 --> 01:06:10.860
Hey, stay away!

01:06:10.860 --> 01:06:11.960
Stay away, you bastard!

01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:14.530
Stay away! Stay away!

01:06:17.470 --> 01:06:19.300
You crazy bastard!

01:06:19.300 --> 01:06:28.110
Go and apologize to Seung Chan
and Ji Yun.

01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:34.990
Please!

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:36.900
No!

01:06:38.020 --> 01:06:39.490
<i>Put it down.</i>

01:06:41.690 --> 01:06:45.360
Come to your senses!

01:07:17.300 --> 01:07:19.130
Let go of me!

01:07:38.220 --> 01:07:40.420
<i>Ajussi!</i>

01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:42.990
Are you okay?

01:07:47.390 --> 01:07:49.960
What about Ji Yun?

01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:51.800
Don't tell me...

01:07:52.900 --> 01:07:55.470
It can't be.

01:07:57.300 --> 01:08:00.970
Tell me.

01:08:36.580 --> 01:08:38.840
Ajussi.

01:08:39.689 --> 01:08:41.430
I found you.

01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:44.170
They couldn't.

01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:50.520
I did what you said, and hid
right under their noses.

01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:54.930
Right. Right.

01:08:54.930 --> 01:09:01.529
You did well. You did well.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:10.340
You did... You did well.

01:09:12.180 --> 01:09:16.130
We found the other children
and they're okay.

01:09:26.689 --> 01:09:28.770
You did well.

01:09:49.250 --> 01:09:51.450
-=Albatross Company suspected

Is this place Heaven?

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:19.450
No.

01:10:19.710 --> 01:10:25.220
This is someplace you can come
when you want to talk to your
brother.

01:10:25.220 --> 01:10:30.500
They will send the message,
kind of like the post office.

01:10:38.060 --> 01:10:40.520
Dumb mutt.

01:10:41.570 --> 01:10:43.640
<i>Liar.</i>

01:10:45.770 --> 01:10:47.970
I don't even want to see you.

01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:50.670
<i>I won't come to see you again.</i>

01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:53.450
I won't come to see you again.

01:11:02.290 --> 01:11:08.160
But if you do want to see your
brother sometime, just call me.

01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:10.460
You trust me, right?

01:11:42.500 --> 01:11:47.320
-=Min Ji Seong
Born June 14, 2008
Died September 21, 2013=-

01:11:48.350 --> 01:11:54.040
By watching CCTV from a
convenience store, we know
these 2 people were lovers.

01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:56.820
They purchased condoms.
Regarding Mi Na's death,

01:11:56.830 --> 01:11:59.540
the autopsy showed no evidence
of rape.

01:11:59.540 --> 01:12:06.890
And a motive for the murder
is still not clear.

01:12:06.890 --> 01:12:10.190
We have a witness!

01:12:15.330 --> 01:12:19.000
Yes, that's the person.

01:12:21.570 --> 01:12:26.710
As everyone can see, the
clothing is similar, but the
defendant is a different person.

01:12:26.710 --> 01:12:30.740
Even from this distance, she
doesn't recognize the witness in
the photo.

01:12:30.740 --> 01:12:34.780
On that dark night, it would have
been impossible for the witness
to identify the defendant clearly.

01:12:34.780 --> 01:12:38.450
<i>The defense attorney is lying to
the court to discredit the witness!</i>

01:12:38.450 --> 01:12:41.020
By furnishing an unreliable
witness, creating false memories,

01:12:41.020 --> 01:12:43.960
and forcing the plaintiff to commit
perjury,

01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:46.530
you're the one who is disrespecting
and deceiving the court!

01:12:46.530 --> 01:12:47.630
Objection!

01:12:47.630 --> 01:12:48.360
The defense attorney just...

01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:50.560
Overruled.

01:12:50.930 --> 01:12:53.430
The victim was being stalked by
an ex-boyfriend.

01:12:53.430 --> 01:12:56.740
Due to her careless behavior,
she often quarreled with the
defendant.

01:12:57.170 --> 01:12:59.740
Just because he had a past
history of sexual battery,

01:12:59.740 --> 01:13:05.610
other suspects who should have
been included were never
investigated.

01:13:05.610 --> 01:13:09.280
Other murder suspects were
completely ignored and the crime
scene destroyed,

01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:14.420
losing the opportunity to arrest
the real killer.

01:13:14.420 --> 01:13:17.360
This demonstrates an incompetent
and dishonest investigation.

01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:19.560
The prosecutor may want to
reflect on this point,

01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:23.600
in order to protect the truth and
real justice,

01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:26.530
and take the lead.

01:13:26.900 --> 01:13:29.100
<i>Just a moment!</i>

01:13:29.100 --> 01:13:32.040
You have overturned the lower
court decision. Any comments?

01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:34.610
Do you really believe
Lee Ju Won is innocent?

01:13:34.610 --> 01:13:42.310
I merely observed the law to get
a just verdict, rather than
manipulating people.

01:13:42.310 --> 01:13:47.090
I believe my client is innocent,
so for me, justice and the law are
not different.

01:13:47.090 --> 01:13:50.020
So at least there won't be a
wrongly accused victim.

01:13:50.020 --> 01:13:52.590
I'm satisfied with that.

01:13:53.690 --> 01:13:54.790
<i>Please tell us something!</i>

01:13:54.790 --> 01:13:56.260
<i>What did you say to the
prosecution?</i>

01:13:56.260 --> 01:13:58.460
<i>Please tell us!</i>

01:13:58.830 --> 01:14:00.670
This, this.

01:14:00.670 --> 01:14:06.910
They should give a thought to
how this makes the officers feel
who worked this.

01:14:06.910 --> 01:14:08.010
<i>Please tell us more!</i>

01:14:08.010 --> 01:14:09.840
<i>What did you say to the
prosecutor?</i>

01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:11.680
Your side is purely virtuous, right?

01:14:12.780 --> 01:14:14.980
They'd never leak information
for money.

01:14:17.550 --> 01:14:19.380
Leak what information?

01:14:19.380 --> 01:14:26.360
If not from the police, how did the
defense lawyer know about the
evidence collection process?

01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:31.860
You're saying that bunch on your
side is above that?

01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:39.200
<i>You bastard!</i>

01:14:42.510 --> 01:14:45.810
Let go! He's an animal! Let go!

01:15:23.510 --> 01:15:25.560
-=Next Episode Preview=-

01:15:26.510 --> 01:15:28.600
<i>Han Ji Su, it's too loud. </i>

01:15:28.650 --> 01:15:29.880
<i>It's the first time since graduation.</i>

01:15:29.890 --> 01:15:31.220
<i>We haven't met in 7 years. </i>

01:15:32.580 --> 01:15:34.020
<i>What in the world happened?</i>

01:15:34.040 --> 01:15:37.090
<i>Detective Han Na Yeong,
you know who the criminal is.</i>

01:15:37.090 --> 01:15:40.030
<i>They say she committed suicide
7 years ago and can't leave.</i>

01:15:40.030 --> 01:15:41.870
<i>If it's the date of her death,</i>

01:15:41.870 --> 01:15:43.700
<i>- Don't play!
- It's the ghost curse. Ghost curse.</i>

01:15:43.700 --> 01:15:44.440
<i>It can't be.</i>

01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:45.690
<i>I'm afraid it will be exposed.</i>

01:15:45.700 --> 01:15:48.110
<i>Didn't you say you hoped
Hae Mi lost?</i>

01:15:48.110 --> 01:15:50.310
<i>Weren't you and Hae Mi together
that day?</i>

01:15:50.310 --> 01:15:52.510
<i>You never told the police that
you saw her that day, did you?</i>

01:15:52.510 --> 01:15:53.980
<i>Seonbae, look at this.</i>

01:15:53.980 --> 01:15:55.080
<i>Can you tell me?</i>

01:15:55.080 --> 01:15:57.190
<i>Did something happen that day?</i>

01:15:57.200 --> 01:15:59.080
<i>Hae Mi.</i>
