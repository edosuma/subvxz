01:21.680 --> 01:24.148
Great, Carlos.
What time are you gonna come over?

01:28.600 --> 01:30.989
There's no cinco on my watch.

01:32.400 --> 01:33.515
Oh, 5.

01:33.720 --> 01:35.711
Oh, okay! Okay, l'll see you then.

01:35.920 --> 01:37.558
''Adidas.''

01:38.880 --> 01:41.394
Hey, Bud. l need your help
with a date.

01:41.640 --> 01:44.473
l'm not videotaping anything, Kel.

01:45.200 --> 01:48.875
No, l'm finally going out with Carlos.

01:49.720 --> 01:53.395
So, what, you need the Spanish
translation for '' it unhooks in back''?

01:55.240 --> 01:58.232
No, l already know how to say that.

01:58.640 --> 02:02.235
No, the problem is that his cousin
is coming in from the old country...

02:02.480 --> 02:05.870
...and the only way that l can go out
with him is if my favourite brother...

02:06.080 --> 02:09.675
...in the whole wide world
keeps Esmeralda company.

02:10.199 --> 02:11.633
'' Esmeralda''?

02:11.880 --> 02:13.950
Oh, that sounds promising.

02:14.200 --> 02:17.192
Yeah, a lot of supermodels
are named Esmeralda.

02:17.400 --> 02:20.358
Come on, Bud, Carlos is so hot.

02:20.560 --> 02:22.994
Please, l will do anything.

02:23.200 --> 02:25.430
That's public record, Kel.

02:26.280 --> 02:29.477
Look, l'm not gonna dog-sit
Esmeralda.

02:30.360 --> 02:33.193
l'll get you a date
with my friend Fawn.

02:35.800 --> 02:38.598
Fawn, Fawn, let's get it on?

02:39.960 --> 02:43.350
-That's the one.
-All right.

02:43.800 --> 02:46.155
But she hates me.

02:46.720 --> 02:49.473
Yeah, but she owes me
for going out with her goofy brother...

02:49.680 --> 02:51.716
...who lives in the attic.

02:52.240 --> 02:55.516
ln the attic? What a dork!

02:58.520 --> 03:02.229
Yeah, he'd be a lot cooler
if he lived in the basement like you.

03:02.920 --> 03:06.390
Ain't gonna live no more
With no big, fat woman

03:06.640 --> 03:10.474
Ain't gonna live no more
With no big, fat woman

03:10.720 --> 03:13.837
Ain't gonna live no more
With no big, fat woman

03:14.080 --> 03:17.390
Al, don't you think
you're jumping to conclusions?

03:17.600 --> 03:20.717
All Dad said was that he's coming
over here with big news.

03:20.960 --> 03:23.030
What could be bigger
than your mother?

03:23.920 --> 03:26.434
ln captivity, that is?

03:27.600 --> 03:29.033
That's probably Ephraim now.

03:29.280 --> 03:32.238
Hey, Ephraim, get in here, you old--

03:32.440 --> 03:33.998
Chicken.

03:34.880 --> 03:38.555
Sorry, Marcie, l mistook you
for a 7 0-year-old hillbilly.

03:38.760 --> 03:42.070
Well, l'm sure that you get that
all the time.

03:42.320 --> 03:44.880
Al, not even you
could dull my spirits today.

03:45.120 --> 03:49.238
Jefferson and l have just returned
from a blissful two days...

03:49.440 --> 03:51.510
...at marriage-encounter camp.

03:52.400 --> 03:57.315
'' Dr. Richelieu's love compound
and water park.''

03:58.240 --> 04:01.152
We've never been happier.
lsn't that right, Jefferson?

04:04.200 --> 04:08.193
Love is all l need to make me happy.

04:11.200 --> 04:13.111
Jefferson?

04:13.800 --> 04:15.995
Are you in there, buddy?

04:17.040 --> 04:19.315
What happened to you?
You used to be a man.

04:19.560 --> 04:22.279
l am a man.

04:23.440 --> 04:25.158
Then who's your favourite Stooge?

04:25.640 --> 04:27.596
The Three Stooges are not funny.

04:27.800 --> 04:32.237
You know who l think is funny?
That Elayne Boosler.

04:34.720 --> 04:36.676
lt's a lot worse than l thought.

04:36.920 --> 04:40.469
Luckily, l have something
for such an emergency.

04:42.240 --> 04:43.878
Jefferson...

04:44.080 --> 04:47.390
...l want you to get a load
of these Big 'Uns here.

04:51.240 --> 04:54.152
lt's all coming back to me.
Moe! Moe, is my favourite Stooge!

04:57.080 --> 05:00.436
Those bastards, they almost got you.

05:01.360 --> 05:04.432
Hey, who's the broad in the kitchen?

05:04.680 --> 05:06.272
Well, that's your wife.

05:06.480 --> 05:08.914
How the hell did that happen?

05:09.920 --> 05:12.753
Let's go, Jefferson.
lt's almost time for my nooner.

05:15.520 --> 05:17.829
Take two of these,
call me in the morning.

05:20.760 --> 05:22.796
Better make it four.

05:25.160 --> 05:27.833
Gee, Al, they seem so much in love.

05:28.040 --> 05:31.237
Maybe this Dr. Richelieu could make
our marriage happier.

05:31.480 --> 05:34.870
Oh, no, Peg. The only doctor
who could do that is Kevorkian.

05:40.040 --> 05:41.951
Hi, Ephraim.

05:45.360 --> 05:48.033
Come in. You hook up the harness
and l'll Crisco the doors.

05:48.240 --> 05:50.435
We'll pop that little woman
right on out of here.

05:50.640 --> 05:54.269
Wait. Wait a minute, Al.
l'm not here to pick up Mama.

05:54.520 --> 05:57.910
l'm taking a trip around the world
with my travel agent.

05:58.120 --> 06:00.031
Wait till you see this.

06:00.920 --> 06:04.515
Hey, Pancake,
get your flapjacks in here, darling.

06:09.800 --> 06:11.199
What'd l tell you, Al, huh?

06:11.400 --> 06:13.914
Part-time travel agent,
part-time stripper...

06:14.120 --> 06:17.715
...and full-time love machine.

06:18.440 --> 06:22.228
Daddy, l can't believe
you could do this.

06:22.480 --> 06:24.675
Oh, l could.

06:25.680 --> 06:27.511
You are a married man.

06:27.760 --> 06:29.990
Married? You told me
you were a college student...

06:30.200 --> 06:32.919
...taking a year off
before law school.

06:35.680 --> 06:39.036
Now, look at that. l gotta get me
another travel agent!

06:39.280 --> 06:43.159
No, you don't. You are gonna go
up there and reconcile with Mom.

06:43.400 --> 06:45.550
No, no, no.
That's not gonna work, Margaret.

06:45.760 --> 06:47.910
We just can't communicate anymore.

06:48.120 --> 06:52.033
Well, maybe that's because
you don't have a creamy-nougat centre.

06:52.920 --> 06:55.070
Hey, l know.

06:57.440 --> 07:02.309
What if we take you and Mom
to this Dr. Richelieu's marriage retreat.

07:02.520 --> 07:06.593
No, no. l don't believe in them
fancy-schmancy headshrinkers.

07:06.800 --> 07:08.518
-lt's got a water slide.
-lt does?

07:08.720 --> 07:12.508
Whoa, l'm there, dude!

07:18.640 --> 07:21.518
l see you're wearing
your easy-access dress.

07:22.920 --> 07:25.957
And l see you're wearing
your wonder briefs.

07:26.840 --> 07:30.674
Look, if you still want me to babysit
Bowzer, you better be nice to me.

07:31.200 --> 07:33.031
Her name is Esmeralda.

07:33.280 --> 07:36.750
Yeah, l don't care what her name is.
She's not getting up on the furniture.

07:38.040 --> 07:39.712
l still get my shot with Fawn, right?

07:39.960 --> 07:42.394
Yes. She'll be here at 1 1 :00.

07:42.640 --> 07:46.235
Just in time to tuck you in and tell you
about her other dates.

07:46.920 --> 07:49.275
Hey, she can bring her other dates
for all l care...

07:49.480 --> 07:51.675
...as long as l get my two minutes.

07:53.760 --> 07:57.639
Carlos is here! Okay, okay, okay.

08:03.720 --> 08:07.429
Hola, Kelly.
You look muy bonita tonight.

08:08.160 --> 08:12.676
Thank you. You look
'' Bobby Bania'' too.

08:13.720 --> 08:17.076
How charming.
One of your American jokes.

08:17.320 --> 08:20.312
Speaking of American jokes...

08:20.680 --> 08:22.477
...this is my brother, Bud.

08:23.480 --> 08:27.951
This, this is my cousin, Esmeralda.

08:37.080 --> 08:38.638
Damn.

08:43.840 --> 08:45.398
l'm sorry, l didn't get a chance...

08:45.600 --> 08:49.115
-...to change into some nicer clothes.
-Oh, no. Please don't worry.

08:49.360 --> 08:52.158
You won't be wearing them
much longer.

08:55.520 --> 08:57.078
Damn!

08:59.280 --> 09:02.989
Carlos, Bud and l are going
to his room to play.

09:04.080 --> 09:05.593
We are?

09:07.680 --> 09:09.671
Thank you, God.

09:15.560 --> 09:21.157
Well, Carlos, it's just you and me
and this big empty couch.

09:21.360 --> 09:24.796
Yes, but when do l get to meet
your chaperons?

09:25.040 --> 09:29.158
Well, soon if you play
your cards right, gosh.

09:29.400 --> 09:31.834
No, no, no. l mean your parents.

09:32.040 --> 09:34.110
Where is your father,
the village shoesmith?

09:36.640 --> 09:39.598
He's with my mother,
the village shopper...

09:39.800 --> 09:42.473
...and my Grandmother, the village.

09:43.840 --> 09:45.990
Well, it was nice of you
to have your brother...

09:46.200 --> 09:48.395
...look after my unsullied cousin,
Esmeralda.

09:48.600 --> 09:50.830
Why, she's going to be a nun
you know?

09:52.560 --> 09:56.109
Oh, God! Oh, God!

09:56.640 --> 10:00.030
You see?
They are praying together already.

10:04.960 --> 10:06.313
Welcome...

10:06.560 --> 10:10.030
...to Dr. Richelieu's
love compound and water park.

10:10.240 --> 10:13.835
l am Dr. Richelieu.

10:16.080 --> 10:17.354
Thank you.

10:17.560 --> 10:19.596
No! No applause, please.

10:19.880 --> 10:24.749
Now, l see before me today
many troubled couples.

10:28.880 --> 10:31.314
Hey, Daddy, how's Mom doing?

10:31.520 --> 10:32.953
She's still not talking to me...

10:33.160 --> 10:37.119
...for lying and saying
l was taking her to lHOP.

10:38.240 --> 10:40.151
Now, l know you all think
your problems...

10:40.360 --> 10:44.433
...might be strange or...unique.

10:44.680 --> 10:46.477
But believe me...

10:46.720 --> 10:50.030
...l have seen it all
and nothing could--

10:50.240 --> 10:53.516
Holy mother of gods!

10:57.000 --> 10:59.070
Well, she's old enough.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.151
And who might you be?

11:02.400 --> 11:06.996
Well, l might be Brad Pitt, but you can
see by the chick on my arm, l'm not.

11:08.240 --> 11:09.753
We're not here for counselling.

11:09.960 --> 11:11.837
We're just here to drop off
my Mom and Dad.

11:12.040 --> 11:16.272
Right, so l'll just unhitch the trailer
and bid everyone here a hidy ho.

11:16.520 --> 11:19.159
Hey, wait, wait! Hold it, Al.
l got to talk to you.

11:19.360 --> 11:21.749
Excuse me a minute, darling.
Would you--?

11:22.440 --> 11:24.158
Listen now....

11:24.720 --> 11:28.554
l gotta talk to you. lt's-- lt's Mama.

11:28.760 --> 11:30.352
She's a little shy.

11:30.600 --> 11:33.478
Of what, metric ton?

11:34.720 --> 11:39.874
No, no, no. l think she's a little
embarrassed to be here.

11:40.240 --> 11:42.435
You know, Al, maybe Daddy's right.

11:42.640 --> 11:46.394
Maybe it'd make her feel better
if we stick around and participate.

11:47.280 --> 11:51.193
Peg, l'd rather go synchronized
swimming with Angela Lansbury.

11:52.000 --> 11:55.879
l'd rather have my neck shaved
by Ray Charles.

11:56.640 --> 12:01.316
l'd even rather have your picture
tattooed on the inside of my eye lids...

12:01.520 --> 12:04.671
...than spend anymore time
with these clowns.

12:08.240 --> 12:11.437
Look, Al, you leave now,
and you can forget about...

12:11.640 --> 12:14.473
...Mama and l
patching things up here.

12:15.640 --> 12:18.234
All right, l'll stay!

12:18.880 --> 12:22.190
But l swear, l'm not touching that bozo
with the big red hair.

12:23.240 --> 12:25.276
Or that guy.

12:32.240 --> 12:36.233
I gave my love a cherry

12:36.440 --> 12:39.989
That had no stone

12:40.240 --> 12:42.515
Oh, that was great. Stop now, please.

12:42.760 --> 12:46.389
-I gave my love a chick en
-Stop, please.

12:46.600 --> 12:50.479
That had no bone

12:50.720 --> 12:52.073
Carlos.

12:52.280 --> 12:54.840
This is very romantic
and everything...

12:55.040 --> 13:00.239
...but l too can be strummed
and twanged.

13:11.640 --> 13:13.437
l feel...

13:14.080 --> 13:16.548
...completely refreshed.

13:16.800 --> 13:21.191
Hey, sex is a lot more fun
with a live partner, isn't it, Bud?

13:21.520 --> 13:23.556
Oh, you got that right--

13:25.560 --> 13:29.314
You know, your petty, little insults
mean nothing to me now.

13:31.160 --> 13:32.991
What's up with Julio?

13:34.720 --> 13:37.792
Well, Carlos just likes
to take things slow.

13:38.040 --> 13:40.190
He's a perfect gentleman.

13:40.440 --> 13:43.591
What, no--? No touch? No kiss?

13:43.800 --> 13:48.920
Not even my favourite yawn,
stretch, cheap feel?

13:50.480 --> 13:52.869
Guys do that on purpose?

13:56.080 --> 14:00.517
Bud, you have rested long enough.

14:01.080 --> 14:02.752
Damn!

14:06.000 --> 14:10.232
I gave my love a baby

14:10.920 --> 14:12.638
Yeah, right.

14:13.920 --> 14:15.876
And now for the next exercise.

14:16.080 --> 14:19.595
The most important thing
in any relationship is trust.

14:19.800 --> 14:22.189
Now, is everybody blindfolded?

14:22.440 --> 14:24.237
And gagged.

14:25.800 --> 14:29.713
-That won't be necessary.
-You don't know the wife.

14:30.600 --> 14:33.433
ln this exercise the husbands
will select either good...

14:33.640 --> 14:35.198
...or bad-tasting food.

14:35.400 --> 14:39.916
And the wives will trustingly eat
what is offered.

14:44.440 --> 14:48.752
Al, l can feel you smiling.

14:49.320 --> 14:51.276
Let's start with the Wankers.

14:51.480 --> 14:53.277
Ephraim, make your selection.

14:53.760 --> 14:58.470
Oh, boy. Can l talk to you a minute,
Dr. Looky-loo?

14:58.680 --> 14:59.669
Be right back, darling.

14:59.880 --> 15:05.079
Listen, l'd like to pass on that
wife-feeding exercise you got there.

15:05.320 --> 15:06.389
Why?

15:06.600 --> 15:10.752
Because l have become
very attached to my hands.

15:11.600 --> 15:14.239
lf you can't reach out to her
with a Weenie Tot...

15:14.440 --> 15:17.432
...how will you reach out to her
with your heart?

15:17.720 --> 15:19.153
Oh, all right.

15:19.400 --> 15:21.436
l'll give her a shot.

15:25.800 --> 15:28.109
Alrighty. Here l come, darling.

15:28.560 --> 15:32.030
Here, sweetie. A little Weenie Tot
for you, my little hippo.

15:32.240 --> 15:33.639
Come on, darling.

15:33.880 --> 15:35.074
Here you go.

15:35.320 --> 15:37.470
My finger!

16:00.880 --> 16:04.509
Dr. Richelieu,
we need to comfort Mrs. Wanker.

16:04.720 --> 16:09.077
She hasn't come back
since the...accident.

16:10.040 --> 16:15.478
Accident?! That was no accident,
you slap-shoed son of an onion.

16:15.720 --> 16:19.918
She'd have eaten my whole hand
if l hadn't have tickled her stomach.

16:20.600 --> 16:24.275
Nevertheless,
Mr. Giggles has a point.

16:24.520 --> 16:28.911
Ephraim, go find your wife
and give her some hug therapy.

16:29.160 --> 16:33.676
Oh, shut up,
you touchy-feely hug freak.

16:36.920 --> 16:39.070
l suppose you have a better way?

16:39.320 --> 16:40.389
l do.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.750
Men, gather round here.

16:43.400 --> 16:45.277
l wanna talk to you.

16:45.960 --> 16:47.757
Now listen here.

16:49.200 --> 16:52.237
Take your wife on a midnight
stroll through the woods.

16:52.480 --> 16:55.472
Let her ramble on about
how everything's your fault.

16:55.720 --> 16:59.633
Then you say,
''You're right. l'm sorry.''

17:00.120 --> 17:01.633
Marriage is fixed.

17:01.840 --> 17:03.990
And they'll never know
that you were thinking...

17:04.200 --> 17:06.349
...about Pamela Anderson
the whole time.

17:08.319 --> 17:09.469
l'll give her a try, Al.

17:09.720 --> 17:13.269
Say, what makes you
such an expert on love?

17:13.520 --> 17:14.953
Well, Ephraim.

17:15.160 --> 17:17.594
Call me a hopeless romantic...

17:17.800 --> 17:20.758
...but l wanna fall in love
one day myself.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.594
Come on, boys. We're off.

17:27.119 --> 17:30.556
Al, why aren't we going to the woods
to save our marriage?

17:30.760 --> 17:34.230
Well, you know my motto, Peg:
lf it's broke, don't fix it.

17:35.400 --> 17:38.392
And this next slide
is a family portrait.

17:42.160 --> 17:43.752
Look at that cute burro.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.514
That burro is my Aunt Maria.

17:47.600 --> 17:50.717
Well, the saddlebags threw me.

17:53.440 --> 17:56.398
ls that a statue of Sally Struthers?

17:56.640 --> 17:58.915
You're very perceptive.

17:59.960 --> 18:02.838
She brought much food
to my country.

18:03.480 --> 18:06.836
We're hoping the next time she comes
she'll share it with us.

18:08.760 --> 18:12.435
l wonder how Bud and Esmeralda
are getting along.

18:12.680 --> 18:15.831
Stop! Stop! You're killing me!

18:16.080 --> 18:19.914
She must be telling him one
of her many amusing jokes, huh?

18:20.560 --> 18:23.199
Well, l like jokes.

18:23.440 --> 18:24.873
Really?

18:25.080 --> 18:29.358
Oh, then soon you will be smiling.

18:29.840 --> 18:32.798
Okay, a duck, a priest, and Fidel Castro
walk into a cantina.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.673
The duck says to the bartender,
'' l would like a cerveza....''

18:36.440 --> 18:37.714
Nice going, Mr. Bundy.

18:37.920 --> 18:40.434
lt's been one hour,
and still no one has returned.

18:40.680 --> 18:44.389
lf l wasn't the prophet of love,
l'd give you the thrashing of your life.

18:44.640 --> 18:49.111
Thrash all you want,
Dr. Skip To My Lou, just don't hug me.

18:51.800 --> 18:54.519
Thanks, Mr. Bundy.
You saved our marriage.

18:54.760 --> 18:57.593
Thanks, Mr. Bundy.
You saved our marriage.

18:57.840 --> 19:00.229
Thanks, Mr. Bundy.
You saved our marriage.

19:04.160 --> 19:06.071
Thanks a lot, Al.

19:06.320 --> 19:11.075
Peg, pack your mother's bag.
She'll be moving on out.

19:11.280 --> 19:12.508
Now, wait.

19:12.720 --> 19:14.870
He saved your marriage as well?

19:15.120 --> 19:18.795
No, you English muffin.
We're busting up for good.

19:19.040 --> 19:20.758
Well, didn't you do what l told you?

19:21.000 --> 19:22.956
Yeah, yeah,
and it worked out perfect. Yeah.

19:23.160 --> 19:26.436
She wants me back now,
then l realized l got these tickets...

19:26.640 --> 19:30.679
...for a trip around the world.
So l can take any babe l want.

19:30.920 --> 19:34.037
Ephraim, you could have two tickets
around the entire galaxy...

19:34.240 --> 19:38.916
...you gin-soaked waffle head.
No one's going with you.

19:39.160 --> 19:41.913
You're going around the world?

19:42.960 --> 19:45.030
l'll go with you.

19:47.280 --> 19:49.077
Bye, baby.

19:50.840 --> 19:53.274
Am l lucky?
Our first stop is Mexico...

19:53.480 --> 19:56.153
...and she's got her own maracas.

20:00.480 --> 20:03.552
Al, this is all your fault.

20:03.800 --> 20:05.074
Everybody!

20:10.280 --> 20:12.032
Then the duck says to the bartender:

20:12.240 --> 20:15.710
'' l can't believe
you serve Cubans here.''

20:23.600 --> 20:27.115
-Well, it's about time.
-Oh, you're right.

20:27.360 --> 20:28.839
lt's almost Esmeralda's curfew...

20:29.040 --> 20:32.715
...and this is the last night before
she enters the convent. Esmeralda?

20:33.360 --> 20:36.830
-Yes, cousin Carlos?
-Say good night to your playmate, Bud.

20:56.680 --> 20:58.193
Goodbye, Kelly.

20:58.440 --> 21:02.069
lf it isn't being to forward,
l would like to kiss you good night.

21:03.400 --> 21:05.118
Sure.

21:07.920 --> 21:10.434
Esmeralda, come.

21:16.160 --> 21:17.593
Can you believe that guy?

21:17.840 --> 21:20.400
How dare he not put out.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.275
You know what? l'm gonna tell
all my girlfriends...

21:23.480 --> 21:25.038
...and ruin his reputation.

21:25.280 --> 21:26.554
Kelly, this is great.

21:26.800 --> 21:27.949
Now, you're desperate...

21:28.160 --> 21:31.470
...and for the first time in my life,
l'm not horny.

21:33.400 --> 21:35.436
Take me now!

21:37.320 --> 21:40.039
That's what l'm here for.

21:43.120 --> 21:44.758
-Fawn?
-Yup.

21:45.440 --> 21:49.433
And l haven't had sex
in 1 5 minutes.

21:49.760 --> 21:51.796
-Let's go.
-No, no, no!
