00:01.600 --> 00:03.090
Previously on Elementary...
How did you come to hear
of me, Ms. Wen?

00:03.130 --> 00:04.358
I knew your brother, Mycroft.

00:04.400 --> 00:06.095
You don't like me
very much, do you?

00:06.140 --> 00:07.767
I don't have to like you,
I just have to help you.

00:07.800 --> 00:11.258
Before my stepfather adopted me,
I was Joan Yun.

00:12.840 --> 00:15.434
Why don't you just admit
you're my half sister?

00:18.280 --> 00:20.248
Running away
won't work.

00:20.280 --> 00:22.248
I'm a detective,
I'll just find you again.

00:22.290 --> 00:23.689
I've got nothing
to say to you.

00:23.720 --> 00:24.687
Okay, Sherlock and I
just helped you out

00:24.720 --> 00:26.517
with a really big problem;
the least you could do

00:26.560 --> 00:28.118
is tell me how long
you've known I exist.

00:28.160 --> 00:29.479
Two years.

00:29.530 --> 00:32.090
But you never called me,
you never came to see me.

00:32.130 --> 00:34.758
Because I never wanted to have
this conversation With you.

00:34.800 --> 00:36.563
It wouldn't have been
this conversation.

00:36.600 --> 00:38.659
It would have been, "Hi, Joan,
I'm Lin, I'm your half sister."

00:38.700 --> 00:40.668
You want to know
more about me? ﬁne.

00:40.700 --> 00:42.668
My mom came to the U.S. in 1980.

00:42.710 --> 00:44.405
She met your dad,
got knocked up.

00:44.440 --> 00:47.079
For a few years, he held it
together, we were a family,

00:47.110 --> 00:50.102
and then one day out of the
blue, he takes apart our TV,

00:50.150 --> 00:51.708
says it's sending messages
that could hurt us.

00:53.620 --> 00:55.815
He went off his meds.
Mom didn't understand.

00:55.850 --> 00:57.408
She didn't know anything
about schizophrenia.

00:57.450 --> 00:59.418
She hardly spoke English.

00:59.460 --> 01:01.485
A few days before
he abandoned us,

01:01.520 --> 01:03.078
he told her about
his first family,

01:03.130 --> 01:04.529
you, your brother, your mom.

01:05.860 --> 01:07.657
That must have been
hard for her.

01:07.700 --> 01:10.294
The hard part was having
to raise me by herself.

01:10.330 --> 01:11.695
The stuff he said
before he left,

01:11.730 --> 01:13.163
that could have been
more ranting.

01:13.200 --> 01:14.531
That's why she didn't
tell me about it

01:14.570 --> 01:18.165
until she had a health scare
a couple years ago.

01:18.210 --> 01:20.178
I searched your names
on the Internet,

01:20.210 --> 01:21.609
"Joan," "Oren," "Mary,"

01:21.640 --> 01:23.198
then I dug a little deeper,

01:23.250 --> 01:24.205
found out you worked
for the police

01:24.250 --> 01:25.649
with a guy named Sherlock,

01:25.680 --> 01:26.840
and he had a brother
who had just died.

01:26.880 --> 01:29.815
Why didn't you just come
and see me then?

01:29.850 --> 01:32.819
Because I realized I already had
all the family I needed.

01:32.860 --> 01:35.715
I only came to you for help
because I was desperate.

01:35.760 --> 01:38.786
But, hey, now you've
got the whole story.

01:38.830 --> 01:42.197
So why don't you do
what I always intended to do--

01:42.230 --> 01:44.198
pretend you never heard it,

01:44.230 --> 01:46.198
forget all about your
crazy-ass dad's other family.

01:46.240 --> 01:48.196
What if that's not what I want?

01:48.240 --> 01:49.207
It doesn't
matter.

01:49.240 --> 01:51.708
It's what I want.

01:57.910 --> 02:01.175
(workout music plays)

02:07.420 --> 02:09.752
(beeping)

02:19.500 --> 02:21.866
*

02:50.570 --> 02:51.969
(car chirps)

02:52.000 --> 02:54.195
(car alarm sounds)

02:59.380 --> 03:01.439
*

03:07.520 --> 03:09.579
BELL: Time of death is
a little before 4:00 am.

03:09.620 --> 03:10.985
Victim is Phoebe Elliot.

03:11.020 --> 03:12.817
She was an assistant
at a marketing fIrm

03:12.860 --> 03:14.452
that does a lot
of business with Asia,

03:14.490 --> 03:17.459
so she would work late,
then hit the gym.

03:17.490 --> 03:19.890
She used rideshare apps
like 20055 to get around.

03:19.930 --> 03:24.219
So Ms. Elliot summoned a 20055
car to pick her up around 3:45.

03:24.270 --> 03:26.238
Gym's door camera doesn't
cover the street,

03:26.270 --> 03:28.238
but it does show
her leaving the gym

03:28.270 --> 03:31.637
when her driver, Sharif,
was about two minutes out.

03:31.670 --> 03:33.535
He arrived and found her body.

03:38.010 --> 03:40.319
She was shot
from this direction.

03:40.350 --> 03:42.511
Blood splatter that way.

03:42.550 --> 03:44.939
There's a void to the right.

03:44.990 --> 03:47.208
Where's the missing blood?

03:49.460 --> 03:51.428
Probably on the shooter's car.

03:51.460 --> 03:53.325
You saying this was a drive-by?

03:53.360 --> 03:55.294
Not so much a drive-by,
more like a parked-by.

03:55.330 --> 03:57.298
Car approaches from this way,

03:57.330 --> 03:58.922
she mistakes it
for her rideshare,

03:58.970 --> 04:02.406
approaches the car
only to be gunned down.

04:02.440 --> 04:04.829
And the car departs
with her blood

04:04.870 --> 04:07.873
on the inside
of the passenger door.

04:10.410 --> 04:11.877
Does she look familiar
to you guys?

04:11.910 --> 04:13.377
No. Why?
I don't know.

04:13.420 --> 04:15.911
I could swear I've seen her
somewhere before.

04:15.950 --> 04:18.919
Most drive-bys, the perps
don't use their own car,

04:18.950 --> 04:19.951
they steal one.

04:21.360 --> 04:22.884
What's your point?

04:22.930 --> 04:25.057
When we were poking around
for next of kin this morning,

04:25.090 --> 04:28.457
all that turned up
was a brother, Keith.

04:28.500 --> 04:31.424
Just did a two-year stint
for grand larceny auto.

04:33.370 --> 04:35.429
MAN: I've been living
with Phoebe since I got out.

04:35.470 --> 04:38.064
She was helping me get
my life together.

04:38.110 --> 04:40.476
She means...

04:40.510 --> 04:42.444
She meant everything to me.

04:42.480 --> 04:44.448
Listen, two days ago,

04:44.480 --> 04:46.072
one of your neighbors
called in a noise complaint.

04:46.110 --> 04:47.771
She wouldn't give her name,

04:47.820 --> 04:49.549
just said she could hear
you and your sister arguing.

04:49.590 --> 04:52.309
I don't remember
fighting two days ago.

04:52.360 --> 04:54.316
But you and your sister
did fight.

04:54.360 --> 04:55.315
No.

04:55.360 --> 04:56.554
I mean, yeah.

04:56.590 --> 04:57.557
You know, sometimes.

04:57.590 --> 04:59.399
It was rough.

04:59.430 --> 05:00.590
Moving in with her.

05:00.630 --> 05:02.564
She... she had all these rules.

05:02.600 --> 05:03.999
Was one of them, "Don't shoot me

05:04.030 --> 05:05.861
whilst pretending
to be my rideshare"?

05:05.900 --> 05:08.437
BELL:
Her phone is missing.

05:08.470 --> 05:10.438
We're pretty sure it was taken
by whoever shot her.

05:10.470 --> 05:13.678
Maybe you sent her some texts
you didn't want us to see.

05:13.710 --> 05:16.679
I will do whatever you want
to prove I didn't do this.

05:16.710 --> 05:19.076
You want me to take
a polygraph? No problem.

05:19.110 --> 05:20.919
Want me to give you
a sample of my DNA?

05:20.950 --> 05:22.918
I will do whatever it takes.

05:22.950 --> 05:24.918
Just please rule me out

05:24.950 --> 05:27.089
so you can find the person
that really killed Phoebe.

05:27.120 --> 05:29.088
All right, say we believe you.

05:29.120 --> 05:32.453
Can you think of anyone else
who had reason to kill Phoebe?

05:32.500 --> 05:35.389
Maybe a stalker?
Stalker?

05:35.430 --> 05:37.660
She was getting a lot
of attention lately.

05:37.700 --> 05:39.497
Something about a selfie she
took when she was in college.

05:39.540 --> 05:42.759
That's where I knew her from.

05:42.810 --> 05:44.664
She was in the culture section
of the Dispatch.

05:44.710 --> 05:47.372
How does a selfie
make her newsworthy?

05:47.410 --> 05:51.779
Ephraim Hill is an appropriation
artist from Portland.

05:51.810 --> 05:54.415
He pulls images
from social media

05:56.650 --> 05:58.686
His _show has been
touring the country,

05:58.720 --> 06:01.154
but this is his first
time in New York.

06:01.190 --> 06:03.624
His work has been
getting a lot of buzz.

06:03.660 --> 06:06.629
So this guy rips off
other people's selfies,

06:06.660 --> 06:08.025
blows them up,

06:08.060 --> 06:10.028
and then charges a
hundred grand apiece?

06:10.070 --> 06:12.459
I'm surprised we're not
investigating his murder.

06:12.500 --> 06:14.866
The rise of social
media has created

06:14.900 --> 06:16.868
a generation
of narcissists

06:16.910 --> 06:20.505
eager to offer up their private
images for public consumption.

06:20.540 --> 06:22.701
But like peacocks
spreading their tails,

06:22.750 --> 06:25.139
such displays,
whilst feeding self-esteem,

06:25.180 --> 06:28.377
also risk attracting
the attention of predators.

06:30.190 --> 06:32.988
You think Keith Elliot
was on to something?

06:33.020 --> 06:35.113
Someone saw her picture
here, got obsessed?

06:35.160 --> 06:36.957
It's one
possibility,

06:36.990 --> 06:39.129
but_ some of the women whose
Images have been stolen

06:39.160 --> 06:41.526
have been
very upset.

06:42.670 --> 06:44.422
Some have threatened to sue.

06:44.470 --> 06:45.664
Maybe Phoebe was one of them.

06:45.700 --> 06:47.668
Ah, it's
about time.

06:47.700 --> 06:49.065
What's about time?

06:49.100 --> 06:50.909
My assistant called
the police yesterday.

06:52.240 --> 06:54.208
I'm Ephraim Hill.

06:54.240 --> 06:56.800
You are here about
a break-In, are you not?

06:56.850 --> 06:58.806
No. There was a
burglary here?

06:58.850 --> 07:01.819
Do you see any art
in these empty spaces?

07:01.850 --> 07:05.217
One might argue there's no art
in the occupied spaces either.

07:05.250 --> 07:06.808
One might.

07:06.860 --> 07:08.452
In fact, I'd welcome it.

07:08.490 --> 07:09.889
See, argument creates awareness,

07:09.930 --> 07:12.592
and awareness drives sales,
but two nights ago,

07:12.630 --> 07:15.224
someone broke in and stole
five of my portraits.

07:15.260 --> 07:18.821
Tragic as that must be,
we're here about Phoebe Elliot.

07:18.870 --> 07:20.462
We were wondering how she felt

07:20.500 --> 07:22.536
about being included
in your exhibit.

07:22.570 --> 07:24.162
Well, why?

07:24.210 --> 07:27.236
She was murdered
just before 4:00 am.

07:27.280 --> 07:28.633
We'd show you the crime
scene photographs,

07:28.680 --> 07:30.500
but you'd probably just
recontextualize them.

07:30.550 --> 07:33.519
Oh, my God.

07:33.550 --> 07:35.677
And, what, you're here
because you think that I...?

07:35.720 --> 07:38.541
A lot of the women were not
happy about becoming your muses.

07:38.590 --> 07:41.514
No, but Phoebe wasn't like that.
She was flattered.

07:41.560 --> 07:43.858
She reached out through
my agent to say so.

07:43.890 --> 07:46.188
She even did some personal
appearances here.

07:46.230 --> 07:48.596
You mind telling us where you
were around 4:00 this morning?

07:48.630 --> 07:49.995
EPHRAIM:
I was on a plane.

07:50.030 --> 07:51.827
Coming home from Paris.

07:51.870 --> 07:54.134
That's where I was when I
learned about the burglary.

07:55.670 --> 07:56.932
Do you think
there's a connection?

07:56.970 --> 07:58.767
The timing is curious,
let's just leave it at that.

07:58.810 --> 08:00.209
No, you don't understand.

08:00.240 --> 08:03.277
If the same person
committed both crimes,

08:03.310 --> 08:05.278
if someone had a problem
with me and Phoebe,

08:05.310 --> 08:08.518
I think I might know who it is.

08:08.550 --> 08:11.542
You are not an artist.

08:11.590 --> 08:13.558
You are a misogynistic phony.

08:13.590 --> 08:17.651
And all the little fangirls
who support you are just as bad.

08:17.690 --> 08:21.023
But when you stole my image,
you messed with the wrong woman.

08:21.060 --> 08:23.028
You all deserve what's coming.

08:23.070 --> 08:25.698
So you can understand why we
wanted to speak with you.

08:25.730 --> 08:28.528
Can you tell us where you were
the past two nights

08:28.570 --> 08:30.629
between midnight and 6:00 am?

08:30.670 --> 08:32.638
I was here, sleeping.

08:32.680 --> 08:34.875
You sounded pretty serious
about getting revenge

08:34.910 --> 08:36.878
against Ephraim Hill
and women like Phoebe.

08:36.910 --> 08:39.640
I did, didn't I?
(chuckles)

08:39.680 --> 08:44.083
I'm working on a part
for this Off-Off-Broadway show.

08:44.120 --> 08:46.918
She's an anarchist,
like, really angry.

08:46.960 --> 08:49.758
But it's a character;
I would never kill anyone.

08:49.790 --> 08:51.052
I'm a vegan.

08:51.090 --> 08:54.059
HOLMES:
So when you threatened revenge,

08:54.100 --> 08:55.658
what exactly did
you have in mind?

08:55.700 --> 08:58.589
Here, I'll show you.

09:09.340 --> 09:11.877
These are portraits
from Ephraim's exhibit.

09:11.910 --> 09:15.311
I put on a wig and went
into the gallery one day.

09:15.350 --> 09:18.217
I used _a hidden camera and took
pictures of his pictures

09:18.250 --> 09:20.218
of our pictures.

09:20.260 --> 09:21.750
I was gonna sell them
outside the showroom

09:21.790 --> 09:23.678
for 50 bucks apiece.

09:23.730 --> 09:25.686
Undercut him and give him
the finger at the same time.

09:25.730 --> 09:28.722
That video was just a part
of my marketing campaign.

09:28.760 --> 09:30.728
When did you take
this picture?

09:30.770 --> 09:33.364
Couple weeks ago.

09:33.400 --> 09:36.904
This man at the edge
of the frame...

09:36.940 --> 09:38.760
he is not in the portrait
at the gallery.

09:40.410 --> 09:43.208
Additionally,
that canvas has folds

09:43.250 --> 09:45.741
angled away from the corners.

09:45.780 --> 09:47.111
In this version,
they're parallel.

09:47.150 --> 09:49.118
So that would mean that
this portrait in the gallery

09:49.150 --> 09:51.948
is not the same one
that was there two weeks ago.

09:51.990 --> 09:53.787
I think someone replaced it
with a forgery.

10:01.130 --> 10:04.725
This just arrived from, uh, CSU.

10:04.770 --> 10:06.738
Mr. Hill conﬁrmed
it is a fake.

10:06.770 --> 10:08.738
And he agrees the only time
it could have been switched

10:08.770 --> 10:10.738
was during the burglary.

10:10.770 --> 10:13.933
So the thief didn't steal
five portraits, he stole six.

10:13.980 --> 10:16.949
Why just swap one
out with a forgery?

10:16.980 --> 10:19.244
I think the burglary
was a mere diversion.

10:19.280 --> 10:21.646
Switching Phoebe's portrait
was the true goal.

10:21.680 --> 10:23.682
Light's better
in the study.

10:27.190 --> 10:29.158
(Holmes grunts)

10:29.190 --> 10:32.796
Speaking of distractions,

10:32.830 --> 10:36.391
couldn't help but notice
a few on your part today.

10:36.430 --> 10:37.761
Anything amiss?

10:37.800 --> 10:38.994
(exhales)

10:39.030 --> 10:40.895
No, I'm fine.

10:40.940 --> 10:44.262
You're drinking out of the bowl
we use for Clyde's baths.

10:47.780 --> 10:50.146
(sighs)

10:50.180 --> 10:51.704
I went to see Lin yesterday.

10:51.750 --> 10:53.012
Lin Wen?

10:53.050 --> 10:54.677
Her case was resolved,
was it not?

10:54.720 --> 10:55.641
Yes, but...

10:55.680 --> 10:57.079
Are you still irked
that she and my brother

10:57.120 --> 10:58.314
once rode below the crupper?

10:58.350 --> 10:59.783
Did you think he was a virgin?

10:59.820 --> 11:02.015
She isn't Mycroft's ex-lover.

11:02.060 --> 11:03.755
She isn't his ex-anything.

11:04.960 --> 11:06.029
She's my sister.

11:10.230 --> 11:12.733
While your half-blood sibling
might have deceived,

11:12.770 --> 11:14.692
exploited and then spurned you,

11:14.740 --> 11:16.332
I might suggest
that the final outcome

11:16.370 --> 11:19.032
is not as tragic
as you make it out to be.

11:19.070 --> 11:20.833
She never wants to see me again.

11:20.880 --> 11:22.745
My brother enlisted the NSA

11:22.780 --> 11:24.748
to fake his own death
two years ago.

11:24.780 --> 11:26.008
You don't see me complaining.

11:26.050 --> 11:27.779
Well, that's different.

11:27.820 --> 11:30.015
I mean, you and Mycroft,
you had each other growing up.

11:30.050 --> 11:32.109
I mean, for better
or for worse.

11:32.150 --> 11:34.948
But she is a missing... piece.

11:34.990 --> 11:36.252
And she's not
the only one.

11:36.290 --> 11:37.826
Your father.

11:37.860 --> 11:39.487
I mean, I always thought
that he left us

11:39.530 --> 11:41.191
because he was sick.

11:41.230 --> 11:42.925
He wasn't capable
of being

11:42.970 --> 11:44.824
mﬂwahmm

11:44.870 --> 11:45.894
But he was capable.

11:45.930 --> 11:47.295
Just not with us.

11:48.870 --> 11:50.508
It sounds like he got better
and then...

11:50.540 --> 11:52.872
stayed with Lin
and her mother for years.

11:52.910 --> 11:55.128
So I guess what
I want to know is

11:55.180 --> 11:56.738
how could he
be a father

11:56.780 --> 11:58.202
to someone else--

11:58.250 --> 12:00.445
even for a little while--

12:00.480 --> 12:02.448
but not even try
with me and Oren?

12:04.090 --> 12:06.786
But I'm not gonna beg.

12:06.820 --> 12:08.811
I left her mother a message.

12:10.390 --> 12:12.790
If Lin won't speak to me,
maybe she will.

12:12.830 --> 12:14.991
(phone chimes)

12:20.340 --> 12:22.831
Marcus _has uncovered a rather
interesting piece of information

12:22.870 --> 12:24.462
about our erased man.

12:24.510 --> 12:26.034
I'm now quite certain

12:26.070 --> 12:27.469
that Phoebe's killer

12:27.510 --> 12:29.137
and the burglar
are one and the same.

12:29.180 --> 12:31.068
Why?

12:31.110 --> 12:34.079
It appears that
both crimes were committed

12:34.120 --> 12:37.089
to protect the perpetrator
of a third crime.

12:38.590 --> 12:41.855
As we know,

12:41.890 --> 12:43.551
this man

12:43.590 --> 12:46.024
was excised
from the forgery

12:46.060 --> 12:47.493
left hanging in
Ephraim Hill's gallery.

12:47.530 --> 12:49.896
But that wasn't
the only alteration.

12:49.930 --> 12:51.864
Phoebe's selfie
captures the man

12:51.900 --> 12:53.561
exiting this car.

12:53.600 --> 12:54.999
The car would've been
too difficult

12:55.040 --> 12:56.860
to remove unnoticed,

12:56.910 --> 12:59.435
so instead, the forger
altered the license plate,

12:59.470 --> 13:02.109
changing this "3" to an "8."

13:02.140 --> 13:03.903
We ran the correct number.

13:03.950 --> 13:05.178
And?

13:05.210 --> 13:06.814
The car once belonged

13:06.850 --> 13:08.875
to a Louis Bowman,

13:08.920 --> 13:10.478
presumably our erased man.

13:10.520 --> 13:12.340
Mr. Bowman is currently serving

13:12.390 --> 13:14.517
a life sentence for murder.

13:14.560 --> 13:16.289
I suspect that the burglary

13:16.320 --> 13:17.981
and Phoebe's execution

13:18.030 --> 13:20.521
were committed to keep
Louis Bowman

13:20.560 --> 13:22.528
in prison.

13:22.560 --> 13:23.959
Because this picture,

13:24.000 --> 13:26.025
Phoebe's original selﬁe,

13:26.070 --> 13:28.231
may well prove
that Louis Bowman is innocent.

13:34.910 --> 13:36.969
Three years ago, Marissa Kagan,

13:37.010 --> 13:38.898
a student at North
Connecticut Univer5ity,

13:38.950 --> 13:40.872
_ was shot and killed
in her off-campus apartment.

13:40.920 --> 13:42.842
A fellow student,
Louis Bowman,

13:42.890 --> 13:44.289
was convicted
of her murder.

13:44.320 --> 13:46.982
He said he was
at the campus library

13:47.020 --> 13:48.282
when Marissa
was killed,

13:48.320 --> 13:49.514
but no one could
corroborate his alibi.

13:49.560 --> 13:50.879
Until now.

13:50.930 --> 13:53.148
Our current murder victim,
Phoebe Elliot,

13:53.200 --> 13:55.919
took this selfie
in 2013.

13:56.900 --> 13:58.868
This is the campus
library behind her,

13:58.900 --> 14:00.299
and based on
the clothing

14:00.340 --> 14:01.989
he was wearing when he was
arrested later that night,

14:02.040 --> 14:03.462
this is Louis Bowman

14:03.510 --> 14:05.034
getting out of his car.

14:05.070 --> 14:07.209
HOLMES:
Phoebe's social media app

14:07.240 --> 14:10.949
stamped that selfie
with the time and date

14:10.980 --> 14:13.915
and that corresponds to the time
of Marissa's murder.

14:13.950 --> 14:15.440
Hmm.

14:15.480 --> 14:17.914
Alibi aside,
the State's case against Louis

14:17.950 --> 14:20.089
seems solid.

14:20.120 --> 14:22.657
It says here he spit
on Marissa's corpse.

14:22.690 --> 14:25.227
Louis and Marissa
knew one another.

14:25.260 --> 14:26.659
Perhaps, for reasons unknown,

14:26.690 --> 14:28.624
he spat on her
earlier in the day.

14:28.660 --> 14:30.969
Perhaps the killer
gained access to his DNA

14:31.000 --> 14:31.989
and framed him.

14:32.030 --> 14:33.497
The fact remains:

14:33.540 --> 14:35.496
if Phoebe's selfie
is to be believed,

14:35.540 --> 14:38.338
Louis Bowman could not have
killed Marissa Kagan.

14:38.370 --> 14:42.602
According to this, Phoebe Elliot
testified for the prosecution.

14:42.640 --> 14:44.471
She and Marissa were friends.

14:44.510 --> 14:46.171
She testified that Louis stalked

14:46.210 --> 14:48.269
and harassed Marissa
for months.

14:48.320 --> 14:51.118
If she had a picture that
could've exonerated Louis,

14:51.150 --> 14:52.515
why did she testify against him?

14:52.550 --> 14:54.017
WATSON:
At the time of the trial,

14:54.060 --> 14:55.413
she probably didn't know
what she had.

14:55.460 --> 14:56.950
On a phone or
even a computer,

14:56.990 --> 14:58.958
Louis and his car are
too small to make out.

14:58.990 --> 15:00.457
You can only really see them

15:00.500 --> 15:03.196
in Ephraim Hill's enlarged
version of the selfie.

15:03.230 --> 15:06.028
You figure Marissa's killer
is still out there.

15:06.070 --> 15:09.164
He saw the selfie
from the gallery

15:09.200 --> 15:11.236
and figured he had
to do something?

15:11.270 --> 15:13.704
Well, it's more likely
that Phoebe recognized Louis

15:13.740 --> 15:15.332
when she saw_
the enlarged ver5ion.

15:15.380 --> 15:17.041
Phoebe and Marissa

15:17.080 --> 15:18.274
ran in the same social circles.

15:18.310 --> 15:19.709
It's possible that

15:19.750 --> 15:21.274
she confided in
Marissa's real killer

15:21.320 --> 15:22.548
without even
reali2ing it.

15:22.580 --> 15:24.047
BELL:_
Luclq for him,

15:24.090 --> 15:25.079
Phoebe scrubbed
her college photos

15:25.120 --> 15:26.610
off the Internet sometime after

15:26.650 --> 15:28.584
Ephraim Hill snagged
her picture.

15:28.620 --> 15:30.520
Her brother said she didn't want
anything out there

15:30.560 --> 15:32.118
that could mess up
her job prospects.

15:32.160 --> 15:33.957
HOLMES:
So, by planting

15:34.000 --> 15:36.457
the forgery, killing Phoebe
and getting rid of her phone,

15:36.500 --> 15:38.593
and by getting rid
of Ephraim's laptop,

15:38.630 --> 15:41.428
the killer hopes to keep
Louis Bowman in prison forever.

15:41.470 --> 15:43.700
WATSON:
The only thing
he wasn't counting on

15:43.740 --> 15:46.129
was Slqden preserving
Phoebe's original image.

15:46.170 --> 15:48.502
And Louis' alibi along with it.

15:50.410 --> 15:53.538
So who wants to give
the good news to Louis Bowman?

15:53.580 --> 15:55.241
LOUIS:
I told them.

15:55.280 --> 15:56.508
I didn't hurt her.

15:58.050 --> 15:59.711
I-I told them
a billion times

15:59.750 --> 16:01.388
I did not hurt Marissa,

16:01.420 --> 16:04.526
and they... they wouldn't
listen to me.

16:04.560 --> 16:06.482
Probably because
there was so much proof

16:06.530 --> 16:08.395
you were stalking her.

16:11.200 --> 16:13.634
When I was in college,
I was, um...

16:13.670 --> 16:15.069
awloNard.

16:15.100 --> 16:16.237
You know.

16:16.270 --> 16:19.501
When... I liked someone,

16:19.540 --> 16:22.236
I would get obsessed.

16:22.280 --> 16:24.009
And with Marissa,
I would just...

16:24.050 --> 16:27.144
send texts nonstop.

16:27.180 --> 16:29.648
And sometimes I would hang
around her apartment

16:29.680 --> 16:31.079
just to feel close to her.

16:31.120 --> 16:32.519
I... couldn't help myself.

16:34.460 --> 16:36.052
But a couple months
after I got here, you know,

16:36.090 --> 16:38.081
I was diagnosed
with an anxiety disorder.

16:38.130 --> 16:39.358
So I take medication now.

16:39.390 --> 16:41.028
I-I don't get those feelings.

16:41.060 --> 16:43.119
Well, our colleague
is speaking with

16:43.170 --> 16:44.398
your public defender

16:44.430 --> 16:46.227
and the attorney who
prosecuted you right now.

16:46.270 --> 16:48.329
He's just gathering
information, but...

16:48.370 --> 16:50.600
I gotta think this is
gonna give both of them

16:50.640 --> 16:52.039
second thoughts
about you being here.

16:52.070 --> 16:53.276
Yeah.

16:53.310 --> 16:55.676
Well, I'd be a lot more excited

16:55.710 --> 16:57.075
if my lawyer weren't a moron.

16:57.110 --> 16:58.702
Three years ago,

16:58.750 --> 17:01.173
I told him that
I had seen the real killer.

17:01.220 --> 17:02.573
He didn't believe me.

17:02.620 --> 17:05.248
Y... You saw
the real killer?

17:05.290 --> 17:06.518
Yeah.

17:06.550 --> 17:08.814
One night I was, um...

17:08.860 --> 17:11.522
I was parked outside
of Marissa's place.

17:11.560 --> 17:14.757
And I saw this guy leaving.

17:14.800 --> 17:16.358
He was wearing a Baja sweater.

17:16.400 --> 17:18.197
It-it had this white
and green pattern on it,

17:18.230 --> 17:19.492
and the hood was up,

17:19.530 --> 17:21.066
so I couldn't see his face.

17:21.100 --> 17:23.307
But Marissa was really upset.

17:23.340 --> 17:26.138
And she was yelling about...

17:26.170 --> 17:28.206
being sick of it.

17:28.240 --> 17:30.140
So...

17:30.180 --> 17:31.772
A couple days later,
she was dead.

17:31.810 --> 17:34.176
Why didn't any of this
come up at the trial?

17:34.220 --> 17:36.609
Well, I told you, my public
defender, he's the worst.

17:36.650 --> 17:38.618
You know, he wouldn't
let me testify.

17:38.650 --> 17:40.117
He wanted me to take the plea.

17:40.160 --> 17:42.116
He... he thought I did it.

17:42.160 --> 17:44.185
Did you tell the police
about the man you saw?

17:44.230 --> 17:45.652
Of course I told the police,

17:45.690 --> 17:47.351
but they were too busy
trying to frame me.

17:49.260 --> 17:53.196
Before I met Marissa, I was...

17:53.240 --> 17:56.095
I was seeing this girl.
Amanda Neal.

17:56.140 --> 17:58.700
It ended badly,
so she dropped out

17:58.740 --> 18:00.799
and she joined
the police academy.

18:00.840 --> 18:02.876
You think she set you up.
They said
that my DNA

18:02.910 --> 18:05.105
was all over Marissa's body,
but that-that's impossible,

18:05.150 --> 18:06.606
because _I hadn't
seen her in weeks.

18:06.650 --> 18:08.811
And Amanda,
she-she had it out for me,

18:08.850 --> 18:10.886
so... so I'm thinking either she

18:10.920 --> 18:14.151
or-or one of her
cop friends, they...

18:14.190 --> 18:15.782
they planted evidence.

18:15.820 --> 18:17.356
That-That's _
the only explanation.

18:20.860 --> 18:23.567
I have to say, I...

18:23.600 --> 18:25.192
I'm not sure why we're here.

18:26.500 --> 18:27.899
The case against
Louis Bowman

18:27.940 --> 18:30.135
was hardly
circumstantial.

18:30.170 --> 18:32.832
His own attorney didn't want
him to take the stand.

18:32.870 --> 18:35.179
Because you believed
he was guilty.

18:35.210 --> 18:36.575
The State had a strong case.

18:36.610 --> 18:38.339
I advised Louis _
to accept a plea bargain

18:38.380 --> 18:40.177
so he could get out
while he still had

18:40.220 --> 18:41.676
some life
left to live.

18:41.720 --> 18:44.280
Were either of you surprised
he refused to take a deal?

18:44.320 --> 18:45.412
Well, I don't prosecute based on

18:45.450 --> 18:46.485
the defendant's response
to a plea offer.

18:47.790 --> 18:50.327
Louis Bowman was
our only suspect.

18:50.360 --> 18:52.828
We had hard physical evidence
against him.

18:52.860 --> 18:55.294
I did my job, Shawn did his.

18:55.330 --> 18:56.752
Justice was served.

18:56.800 --> 18:59.621
Phoebe Elliot's photograph
suggests othenNise.

18:59.670 --> 19:01.228
The image could
be fabricated.

19:01.270 --> 19:04.205
The date and time stamp
could be inaccurate.

19:04.240 --> 19:05.730
It's also not clear

19:05.770 --> 19:07.374
that the man in this picture
is Louis Bowman.

19:07.410 --> 19:09.503
Someone else could've been
drivmg his car.

19:09.540 --> 19:12.270
Or the image could be
exactly as it appears

19:12.310 --> 19:14.346
and you could have put
an innocent man behind bars.

19:14.380 --> 19:17.281
If you discount
the physical evidence, sure.

19:17.320 --> 19:18.139
But you can't.

19:18.190 --> 19:20.351
Look, all you have
is a fuzzy picture

19:20.390 --> 19:22.210
and an even fuzzier theory

19:22.260 --> 19:25.184
about the police planting
Louis Bowman's spit.

19:25.230 --> 19:26.959
How do you plant spit?

19:26.990 --> 19:29.595
The police took cheek swabs
from Louis during his arrest.

19:29.630 --> 19:32.292
Which could have been used to
create trace evidence, at best.

19:33.400 --> 19:34.594
There was enough saliva

19:34.640 --> 19:36.232
on Marissa's shirt

19:36.270 --> 19:37.760
to soak all the way through
to her bra.

19:37.810 --> 19:40.631
That didn't come from
any cheek swab.

19:40.680 --> 19:44.741
But don't take my word for it.

19:44.780 --> 19:46.805
Take a look
at our work.

19:46.850 --> 19:48.738
I'm sure you'll agree

19:48.780 --> 19:50.645
we got the right guy.

19:54.390 --> 19:56.551
Can't believe he said
he was my boyfriend.

19:56.590 --> 19:58.478
Why would you believe him?

19:58.530 --> 20:00.657
So you two never dated?

20:00.700 --> 20:03.419
I went out with Louis twice.

20:03.470 --> 20:05.768
But when I told him that
we should just be friends,

20:05.800 --> 20:07.267
he didn't get it.

20:07.300 --> 20:09.359
Kept texting me,
hanging around my dorm...

20:09.400 --> 20:10.469
Is that why you
dropped out of school?

20:10.510 --> 20:11.738
No.

20:11.770 --> 20:14.375
College just wasn't for me.

20:14.410 --> 20:17.299
Louis was annoying,

20:17.350 --> 20:19.238
but back then I thought
he was harmless.

20:19.280 --> 20:20.941
Marissa probably did, too,

20:20.980 --> 20:22.345
right up until he killed her.

20:22.380 --> 20:23.608
WATSON:
Like we said,

20:23.650 --> 20:24.844
we are investigating
the possibility

20:24.890 --> 20:26.289
that he did not kill her.

20:26.320 --> 20:28.754
Then you're both idiots.

20:28.790 --> 20:32.385
He thinks that you planted
DNA evidence on her body.

20:33.700 --> 20:36.260
I'm a Connecticut state trooper.

20:36.300 --> 20:37.927
I write speeding tickets.

20:37.970 --> 20:39.926
I don't have access
to murder investigations.

20:39.970 --> 20:42.530
We looked into you.

20:42.570 --> 20:44.265
There's a lot of cops
in your family.

20:44.310 --> 20:46.961
Your dad's a state
trooper, just like you;

20:47.010 --> 20:49.433
your uncle's a captain
in Waterbury PD.

20:49.480 --> 20:51.277
Your brother
and three cousins

20:51.310 --> 20:52.675
are all on the job,

20:52.710 --> 20:54.814
different jurisdictions,
all over the state.

20:54.850 --> 20:56.374
Right.

20:56.420 --> 20:57.489
Now I remember.

20:57.520 --> 20:59.317
I called them all up

20:59.350 --> 21:02.558
and told them I needed help
putting Louis' saliva

21:02.590 --> 21:03.887
on my friend's
dead body.

21:03.930 --> 21:05.329
I kept a jar
of the stuff

21:05.360 --> 21:06.588
after I left school.

21:06.630 --> 21:07.858
You probably think
that's weird, too.

21:07.900 --> 21:10.892
*

21:10.930 --> 21:13.296
Would you excuse me
a moment?

21:18.970 --> 21:20.938
Hey.

21:20.980 --> 21:22.800
What are you doing here?

21:22.840 --> 21:24.774
Who the hell do
you think you are?

21:24.810 --> 21:26.744
Calling my mother?

21:26.780 --> 21:28.748
Come with me.

21:30.420 --> 21:32.388
In case you haven't noticed,
we are in a police station.

21:32.420 --> 21:34.308
You need to get yourself
under control.

21:34.360 --> 21:36.453
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did I break the rules?

21:36.490 --> 21:38.651
I figured since you thought
it was okay to call my mom,

21:38.690 --> 21:40.749
you wouldn't mind me
coming by your work.

21:40.800 --> 21:43.462
I told you I had
some questions about my father.

21:43.500 --> 21:45.422
Well, since you asked so
nicely, here's something else

21:45.470 --> 21:46.926
you might find interesting.

21:46.970 --> 21:49.666
Five years after he
left, he came back.

21:49.700 --> 21:51.406
My mom, to her credit,

21:51.440 --> 21:53.328
told him to get lost, to go
back to his first family.

21:53.380 --> 21:54.802
But he said he couldn't.

21:54.840 --> 21:56.979
He said that you and
your brother and your mom

21:57.010 --> 21:58.671
had replaced him.

21:58.710 --> 22:00.575
You weren't even
usmg his last name.

22:00.620 --> 22:02.679
You were ashamed of it,
ashamed of him.

22:02.720 --> 22:04.711
And he hated you for it.

22:04.750 --> 22:06.388
And I mean hated, Joan.

22:06.420 --> 22:07.819
He wished you were all dead.

22:07.860 --> 22:09.816
And now that I've met you,

22:09.860 --> 22:11.384
I get it.

22:11.430 --> 22:14.422
Leave me and my mother alone.

22:21.500 --> 22:23.707
(phone ringing)

22:25.870 --> 22:28.407
If you're curious to know how my
meeting with the attorneys went,

22:28.440 --> 22:31.147
it's gonna be
a short conversation.

22:31.180 --> 22:32.909
Yeah, well, I'm not calling
about Marissa Kagan's murder.

22:32.950 --> 22:34.440
I'm calling
about Phoebe Elliot's.

22:34.480 --> 22:35.674
You might want
to get back down here.

22:35.720 --> 22:37.585
The car the shooter
used the other night

22:37.620 --> 22:39.417
turned up in Connecticut.

22:39.450 --> 22:41.918
We've got a suspect in custody.

22:43.460 --> 22:45.018
I told you yesterday.

22:45.060 --> 22:46.152
I love Phoebe.

22:46.190 --> 22:47.521
She was my sister.

22:47.560 --> 22:48.857
I didn't kill her.

22:48.900 --> 22:50.959
The evidence says you did.

22:51.000 --> 22:51.864
What evidence?

22:51.900 --> 22:53.390
The night Phoebe died,

22:53.440 --> 22:55.567
this car was
stolen from behind

22:55.600 --> 22:57.568
a restaurant in West
Hartford, Connecticut.

22:57.610 --> 23:01.478
It was found a few hours later,
abandoned in Bridgeport.

23:01.510 --> 23:04.809
Her blood was all_ over the
rear passenger-Side door.

23:04.850 --> 23:07.045
Now, it took the local cops
some time to connect it

23:07.080 --> 23:09.412
to your sister's murder in
New York, but when they did,

23:09.450 --> 23:11.179
we sent them the
DNA you gave us,

23:11.220 --> 23:13.188
and it was a perfect match

23:13.220 --> 23:15.780
for DNA found
inside the vehicle.

23:15.820 --> 23:17.981
It's not possible...

23:18.030 --> 23:19.554
Sure, it is.
You were crying earlier.

23:19.590 --> 23:20.796
You stole this car
in West Hartford, Connecticut.

23:20.830 --> 23:23.151
No, I wasn't.

23:23.200 --> 23:25.964
The capillaries in your eyes

23:26.000 --> 23:28.491
have increased in prominence,
and that's not a symptom

23:28.540 --> 23:30.804
of the upper-respiratory
infection you've been fighting,

23:30.840 --> 23:33.502
and tree pollen, to which you
have an allergy, is very low.

23:33.540 --> 23:36.179
Did you speak
to Lin Wen again?

23:36.210 --> 23:37.973
I don't want
to talk about it.

23:38.010 --> 23:39.546
KEITH:
This is bull.

23:39.580 --> 23:41.548
You steal cars, Keith.

23:41.580 --> 23:43.172
It's what landed you in prison.

23:43.220 --> 23:44.983
I used to steal cars.

23:45.020 --> 23:46.578
I hotwired them.

23:46.620 --> 23:47.985
Old sports cars.

23:48.020 --> 23:49.180
Vettes and Porsches parked

23:49.220 --> 23:50.687
on the streets of New York.

23:50.730 --> 23:52.857
But you're saying
I stole a 2012 four-door

23:52.890 --> 23:54.528
from a valet lot in Connecticut?

23:54.560 --> 23:55.822
Any car will do
when you're

23:55.860 --> 23:57.464
looking to commit
a murder, right?

23:57.500 --> 23:59.024
And you're forgetting
about the DNA.

23:59.070 --> 24:02.494
You planted it, obviously,
because I didn't steal this car!

24:02.540 --> 24:03.939
And I sure as hell
didn't kill my sister!

24:03.970 --> 24:05.767
You said Louis Bowman
also accused the police

24:05.810 --> 24:07.471
of planting DNA,
didn't you?

24:07.510 --> 24:08.579
Yeah, why?

24:08.610 --> 24:09.736
Just odd, isn't it?

24:09.780 --> 24:11.077
Two men making
such a bold accusation

24:11.110 --> 24:12.577
just within hours
of each other.

24:12.610 --> 24:14.544
Especially given
the fact that we think

24:14.580 --> 24:16.673
Louis Bowman
may well be innocent.

24:16.720 --> 24:18.483
Yes, it's odd,
but Marissa Kagan

24:18.520 --> 24:20.488
was killed in
Bristol, Connecticut

24:20.520 --> 24:22.659
and Phoebe Elliot
died in the Bronx.

24:22.690 --> 24:25.488
I mean, do you honestly think
two different police departments

24:25.530 --> 24:27.828
in two different states,
including the one we work in,

24:27.860 --> 24:29.259
are just gonna
sprinkle DNA around

24:29.300 --> 24:30.858
whenever they need
to close a case?

24:30.900 --> 24:32.663
That's right,
Phoebe died in the Bronx.

24:32.700 --> 24:35.692
Marcus said
the shooter's car was abandoned

24:35.740 --> 24:37.503
in Bridgeport, and that's
also odd, isn't it?

24:37.540 --> 24:38.962
Someone stealing
a car in Connecticut

24:39.010 --> 24:40.568
to commit a murder
in New York,

24:40.610 --> 24:42.976
only to drive it
all the way back to Connecticut.

24:44.680 --> 24:46.147
You have a copy
of the lab report

24:46.180 --> 24:47.613
that places
Keith in the car?

24:47.650 --> 24:48.719
Yeah, it's right there.

24:54.820 --> 24:56.811
I retract
my earlier theory.

24:56.860 --> 24:59.226
I don't think anyone planted
evidence in either case.

24:59.260 --> 25:01.023
If I'm right,
the killer didn't have to.

25:01.060 --> 25:03.255
She can create _
any eVIdence she de5ires.

25:10.610 --> 25:13.135
I tested the samples personally.

25:13.170 --> 25:16.674
The DNA was a match
for Keith Elliot.

25:16.710 --> 25:18.598
Well, you're a supervisor,
Ms. Mercado.

25:18.650 --> 25:20.675
Do you normally run tests
like these yourself?

25:20.720 --> 25:22.972
I do all
the high priority cases.

25:23.020 --> 25:24.681
Rapes, murders--
that kind of thing.

25:24.720 --> 25:25.812
I want to make_ sure
they're done right.

25:25.850 --> 25:29.058
And they were done right
with Keith Elliot.

25:29.090 --> 25:30.751
We found multiple sources
of DNA in the car.

25:30.790 --> 25:33.725
And one was a definitive match
for your suspect.

25:33.760 --> 25:35.227
Were there any
alleles missing?

25:35.260 --> 25:36.295
It was a complete match.

25:36.330 --> 25:37.592
How many loci?

25:37.630 --> 25:38.619
Thirteen.

25:38.670 --> 25:39.921
And was it a match

25:39.970 --> 25:42.063
for hair or skin samples?
Hair.

25:42.100 --> 25:43.738
Yes, 'cause according
to our records,

25:43.770 --> 25:45.260
there were nine strands of
hair found in the vehicle.

25:45.310 --> 25:46.902
But none of them
with the root attached.

25:46.940 --> 25:48.305
That would make it
very, very hard

25:48.340 --> 25:49.705
to get an exact match,
wouldn't it?

25:49.740 --> 25:51.901
Sorry, I meant skin.

25:51.950 --> 25:53.349
It was a skin match.

25:53.380 --> 25:55.644
The samples didn't
actually match.

25:55.680 --> 25:57.079
Did they, Ms. Mercado?

25:57.120 --> 25:58.678
I'm sorry?

25:59.720 --> 26:01.017
WATSON:
We've studied your record.

26:01.060 --> 26:02.982
You're very fast.

26:03.020 --> 26:04.681
And you've had an unusually
high rate of results

26:04.730 --> 26:06.357
that support the State.

26:06.390 --> 26:08.221
I'm good at my job.

26:08.260 --> 26:09.818
But we don't think you
actually do your job at all.

26:09.860 --> 26:12.090
We think you rely
on "dry-labbing."

26:12.130 --> 26:13.688
You write false reports.

26:13.740 --> 26:15.594
Which conform to the wishes
of the authorities,

26:15.640 --> 26:17.835
instead of actually testing
the samples that you're given.

26:17.870 --> 26:19.701
BELL: It's not like this kind
of thing hasn't happened before.

26:19.740 --> 26:22.777
They've had the same problem
in Massachusetts,

26:22.810 --> 26:24.744
North Carolina;
even the FBI's lab

26:24.780 --> 26:26.338
has made thousands
of questionable hair matches

26:26.380 --> 26:28.848
over the last 20 years,
including 32

26:28.880 --> 26:30.279
in death penalty cases.
HOLMES: Mm-hmm.

26:30.320 --> 26:31.685
Sometimes it's
inexpenence.

26:31.720 --> 26:32.880
_ Sometimes it's
just incompetence,

26:32.920 --> 26:34.683
but you-- you're
a supervisor.

26:34.720 --> 26:36.381
I think you know
what you're doing.

26:36.420 --> 26:38.752
So perhaps you're just driven
by a desire to feel important,

26:38.790 --> 26:40.655
to be the hero,
to be the key witness

26:40.700 --> 26:42.349
putting bad guys away--
am I right?

26:42.400 --> 26:43.924
I have an excellent reputation.

26:43.970 --> 26:46.268
Ask anyone-- I am an asset
to law enforcement.

26:46.300 --> 26:48.666
Yes, but you're not supposed
to be an asset, are you?

26:48.700 --> 26:50.099
You're supposed
to be a scientist.

26:50.140 --> 26:52.734
You're supposed to be an
impartial seeker of truth.

26:52.770 --> 26:54.635
But you're not,
you're a charlatan!

26:54.680 --> 26:56.671
And you've sent at least
one innocent man to prison--

26:56.710 --> 26:57.642
Louis Bowman!

26:57.680 --> 26:59.807
I stand by my work.

26:59.850 --> 27:01.715
BELL: Then you won't
mind if we retest

27:01.750 --> 27:03.411
all the evidence in
the Phoebe Elliot case

27:03.450 --> 27:05.281
at another facility?

27:05.320 --> 27:07.185
Because if we're right
about what's going on here,

27:07.220 --> 27:10.155
the person who had the best
motive to kill her was you.

27:11.930 --> 27:14.296
You're police.

27:14.330 --> 27:15.957
You know how things work.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.321
In most cases,
even high profile ones,

27:18.370 --> 27:20.691
detectives figure out
who did it

27:20.740 --> 27:23.664
by talking to the right people,
following their gut.

27:23.710 --> 27:26.861
It's finding proof
that's tough.

27:26.910 --> 27:28.775
You used to be able
to get conVIctions

27:28.810 --> 27:31.074
wit_h witness statements
or Circumstantial eVIdence,

27:31.110 --> 27:33.169
but these days

27:33.210 --> 27:35.314
juries want
something physical.

27:35.350 --> 27:36.840
They want DNA.

27:36.880 --> 27:39.747
And you give it to them.

27:39.790 --> 27:41.815
I'm on your side.

27:41.860 --> 27:44.158
You know that DNA
can be more subjective

27:44.190 --> 27:46.021
than people think.

27:46.060 --> 27:47.755
It can be hard to find
an uncontaminated sample.

27:47.800 --> 27:50.360
The results _
can be inconcluswe.

27:50.400 --> 27:52.163
So when the police
are sure who did it,

27:52.200 --> 27:54.737
but the tests aren't clear,

27:54.770 --> 27:58.706
I give law enforcement
the benefit of the doubt.

27:58.740 --> 27:59.934
You frame people.

27:59.970 --> 28:03.178
You corrupt the justice process
from the inside.

28:03.210 --> 28:05.940
I help get convictions.

28:05.980 --> 28:07.948
Louis Bowman got
a life sentence thanks to you.

28:07.980 --> 28:09.470
Only it's looking
more and more

28:09.520 --> 28:12.444
like he didn't kill
Marissa Kagan three years ago.

28:12.490 --> 28:15.254
GREGSON: We think that when
Phoebe Elliot realized she had

28:15.290 --> 28:17.155
a picture that could
exonerate him,

28:17.190 --> 28:18.487
she told someone.

28:18.530 --> 28:19.986
Maybe it was you.

28:20.030 --> 28:21.793
Maybe it was the lab to confirm

28:21.830 --> 28:23.149
whether the DNA was accurate.

28:23.200 --> 28:25.828
HOLMES:
If that was the case,

28:25.870 --> 28:27.326
you would've realized
how much was at stake.

28:27.370 --> 28:29.930
An audit would uncover the
same pattern that we found.

28:29.970 --> 28:31.858
You were in danger
of going to jail.

28:31.910 --> 28:33.366
And having every conviction

28:33.410 --> 28:36.277
that you'd engineered
overturned.

28:36.310 --> 28:38.005
Killing Phoebe would
stop that from happening.

28:38.050 --> 28:40.143
I told you I didn't do that.

28:40.180 --> 28:41.818
I never even met the woman.

28:41.850 --> 28:44.045
Phoebe was shot
in the Bronx.

28:44.090 --> 28:45.785
But her killer drove a car

28:45.820 --> 28:47.310
full of evidence all
the way to Bridgeport.

28:47.350 --> 28:49.113
And the only reason to do that

28:49.160 --> 28:50.855
was to make sure that
that car was processed

28:50.890 --> 28:53.222
at the Connecticut
forensics lab-- your lab--

28:53.260 --> 28:55.455
where you could implicate
whoever you wanted.

28:55.500 --> 28:58.298
Phoebe's brother was the
lowest hanging fruit.

28:58.330 --> 29:00.321
HOLMES:
You said yourself
good police work

29:00.370 --> 29:01.860
usually reveals the killer.

29:01.900 --> 29:03.936
In this case,
you have means and motive.

29:03.970 --> 29:05.460
And unless you can
provide us with an alibi,

29:05.510 --> 29:07.239
you also have opportunity.

29:07.270 --> 29:08.976
I was home alone that night.

29:09.010 --> 29:11.069
But I can prove
I didn't kill her.

29:11.110 --> 29:12.873
Recheck the DNA evidence
from the stolen car

29:12.910 --> 29:14.377
in your own lab.

29:14.420 --> 29:15.773
Or a private lab.

29:15.820 --> 29:17.378
Or any lab you want.

29:17.420 --> 29:19.547
You'll see that none of it
belongs to me.

29:19.590 --> 29:20.955
What would that prove?

29:20.990 --> 29:22.309
You're an expert.

29:22.360 --> 29:23.987
You could've
removed your DNA.

29:24.030 --> 29:25.554
Or worn protective gear
to make sure

29:25.590 --> 29:27.922
it never ended up in that car
in the first place.

29:27.960 --> 29:30.963
I could've removed all the DNA
from that car, sure.

29:31.000 --> 29:35.835
But to remove only my own,
that would be a neat trick.

29:35.870 --> 29:37.565
As far as protective gear goes,

29:37.600 --> 29:40.307
why would I risk
getting pulled over

29:40.340 --> 29:42.831
for driving around
in a Hazmat suit?

29:42.880 --> 29:44.802
In your version
of the story,

29:44.850 --> 29:46.875
I knew that I'd be
processing the evidence,

29:46.910 --> 29:49.845
so I wouldn't have needed
to keep my DNA out of the car,

29:49.880 --> 29:52.815
because I never would've
reported a match to myself.

29:52.850 --> 29:54.351
Right?

29:54.390 --> 29:56.950
I didn't kill anyone.

29:56.990 --> 29:58.480
Do the tests.

29:58.530 --> 30:00.122
Do them right.

30:00.160 --> 30:02.958
You'll see I'm innocent.

30:07.870 --> 30:09.360
Every piece of evidence
she ever handled,

30:09.400 --> 30:11.834
every lab report
with her name on it,

30:11.870 --> 30:13.462
it's all got to be reexamined,

30:13.510 --> 30:15.603
which means hundreds of cases

30:15.640 --> 30:17.278
getting reopened
in Connecticut.

30:17.310 --> 30:18.948
Of course, in the meantime,
we got our own problems.

30:18.980 --> 30:20.948
I'm not convinced that
she killed Phoebe Elliot.

30:20.980 --> 30:22.311
Nor am I.

30:22.350 --> 30:23.988
You have to appreciate
the irony.

30:24.020 --> 30:25.942
Were someone like Ms. Mercado
to process the eVIdence

30:25.990 --> 30:27.446
they would happily provide

30:27.490 --> 30:28.957
the false match
needed for a conviction,

30:28.990 --> 30:30.878
but_ an honest test would
likely exonerate her.

30:30.930 --> 30:35.026
Still, whoever killed Phoebe had
to have known about her, right?

30:35.060 --> 30:37.028
Why else would they drive the
car all the way to Connecticut?

30:37.060 --> 30:39.062
They were counting on her
doing what she did.

30:39.100 --> 30:40.965
They knew that no matter
what the test revealed,

30:41.000 --> 30:43.639
her report would confirm
the police's initial suspect.

30:43.670 --> 30:45.934
Her ability to produce
evidence on demand

30:45.970 --> 30:47.369
can't have gone
completely unnoticed

30:47.410 --> 30:49.878
by Connecticut's entire
criminal justice system.

30:49.910 --> 30:51.639
Which means we're probably

30:51.680 --> 30:54.012
looking for someone
in law enforcement.

30:56.420 --> 30:58.980
(knocking)

31:10.500 --> 31:11.922
Could we talk?

31:11.970 --> 31:13.961
(door closes)

31:16.100 --> 31:17.567
More detective stuff?

31:17.600 --> 31:18.931
A technician's been
falsifying evidence

31:18.970 --> 31:20.460
at a crime lab.

31:20.510 --> 31:22.569
We think someone knew
and took advantage.

31:22.610 --> 31:24.009
I was going through
all of her cases

31:24.050 --> 31:25.005
and making lists
of the people

31:25.050 --> 31:26.574
who were in the habit

31:26.610 --> 31:28.612
of steering work her way.

31:28.650 --> 31:31.585
No Sherlock?

31:31.620 --> 31:33.542
He's talking to a suspect
we already know about.

31:38.060 --> 31:40.654
I don't do this very often,
so I may suck at it,

31:40.690 --> 31:42.658
but I came to apologize.

31:42.700 --> 31:47.091
Obviously, I have a lot of
unresolved anger over my father.

31:47.130 --> 31:50.099
Our father.

31:50.140 --> 31:53.007
I lied when I said he hated you.

31:53.040 --> 31:55.429
He never came back to us,
and as far as I know,

31:55.480 --> 31:57.300
he never even knew
your mom remarried.

31:57.340 --> 32:00.138
So I'm sorry.

32:03.020 --> 32:07.081
Well, I had a feeling
that you... might get angry

32:07.120 --> 32:09.088
after you found out
that I called your mother,

32:09.120 --> 32:10.712
so I'm sorry, too.

32:10.760 --> 32:13.126
I've never really been good
at taking no for an answer.

32:13.160 --> 32:16.550
(chuckles) Pretty sure
that's a Yun family trait.

32:16.600 --> 32:17.965
Not knowing when to quit.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.969
When in doubt, charge ahead.

32:23.070 --> 32:25.436
You have the right
to be curious about Dad.

32:25.470 --> 32:28.268
Like you said,
for you, he's a mystery.

32:28.310 --> 32:30.528
But for me...

32:30.580 --> 32:32.741
I remember him giving
me piggyback rides

32:32.780 --> 32:34.975
and calling me
silly nicknames.

32:35.020 --> 32:37.215
And I remember him getting
angry and confused,

32:37.250 --> 32:39.616
and then he was gone.

32:39.650 --> 32:41.618
He was someone
that I had and I lost,

32:41.660 --> 32:45.448
and it hurts
to think about that.

32:45.490 --> 32:49.096
Aanay, um, I talked to Mom,

32:49.130 --> 32:52.019
and she said it's okay
if you want to call her again.

32:57.140 --> 32:59.131
I appreciate that.

33:03.110 --> 33:05.169
Good luck with all this.

33:15.090 --> 33:17.251
I already told you I
didn't have anything to do

33:17.290 --> 33:19.679
with Marissa's case
three years ago.

33:19.730 --> 33:21.357
That's not exactly
true, is it?

33:21.400 --> 33:23.550
By now, you've heard
about the arrest

33:23.600 --> 33:26.023
of the crime
lab superwsor

33:26.070 --> 33:28.038
who processed the evidence
in Marissa's murder.

33:28.070 --> 33:29.662
It turns out that you made
quite a few calls to her

33:29.700 --> 33:30.735
while she was working the case.

33:30.770 --> 33:32.806
So?

33:32.840 --> 33:34.808
So your cousin Bailey Neal
is in Narcotics.

33:34.840 --> 33:37.570
Over the last few years, he's
sent a lot of cases Zoe's way.

33:37.610 --> 33:41.341
Maybe that's just a coincidence,
or maybe he knew how she worked.

33:41.380 --> 33:43.177
Maybe he told you
about his secret weapon.

33:43.220 --> 33:44.585
Okay.

33:44.620 --> 33:46.588
First, that's BS.

33:46.620 --> 33:49.282
Bailey is a good cop, the best.

33:51.130 --> 33:54.190
Second, the only reason
I called Zoe as much as I did

33:54.230 --> 33:56.198
was because I felt guilty.

33:56.230 --> 33:58.095
About?

33:58.130 --> 34:00.291
Marissa was my friend.

34:00.330 --> 34:03.128
If I didn't drop out,
I don't know,

34:03.170 --> 34:05.638
maybe Louis wouldn't have
stopped obsessing over me

34:05.670 --> 34:07.206
and started obsessing over her.

34:07.240 --> 34:09.538
So did I encourage Zoe

34:09.580 --> 34:11.844
to make sure_he_wouldn't
get away With it? Yes.

34:11.880 --> 34:15.111
Absolutely. But I was like that
with everyone on the case.

34:15.150 --> 34:17.118
Well, there could be another
reason that you wanted

34:17.150 --> 34:19.186
to point Zoe at Louis.

34:20.320 --> 34:22.117
You killed Marissa.

34:22.160 --> 34:24.185
What?

34:24.230 --> 34:26.186
You say that you and Louis
weren't a couple.

34:26.230 --> 34:27.379
He says that you were.

34:27.430 --> 34:28.829
What if he's telling the truth?

34:28.860 --> 34:31.124
He grew interested
in your friend.

34:31.170 --> 34:32.489
You got jealous.

34:32.530 --> 34:34.862
(chuckles)
Something funny?

34:34.900 --> 34:39.166
Yeah. Uh, Marissa and I never
would have fought over a guy.

34:39.210 --> 34:40.199
You were that close?

34:40.240 --> 34:42.105
No, she was that gay.

34:43.380 --> 34:45.348
Her family is super religious.

34:45.380 --> 34:47.348
She never got around
to telling them.

34:47.380 --> 34:50.349
The only people who knew
were me and Phoebe

34:50.380 --> 34:52.189
and a couple of other friends.

34:52.220 --> 34:53.209
I'll give you their names.

34:53.250 --> 34:54.217
You can talk to them.

34:54.260 --> 34:55.318
They'll tell you.

34:55.360 --> 34:57.316
After she was killed,

34:57.360 --> 34:59.726
we decided it wasn't
our place to say anything.

34:59.760 --> 35:02.194
Plus we knew it wasn't relevant

35:02.230 --> 35:04.824
because we knew Louis
was the one who did it.

35:04.870 --> 35:06.667
Let's say we believe you.

35:06.700 --> 35:08.497
Is there any other
"irrelevant" information

35:08.540 --> 35:09.598
you've been keeping to yourself?

35:11.470 --> 35:14.200
You say Louis is innocent,
I say you're wrong,

35:14.240 --> 35:18.506
but Marissa was seeing somebody,
a married woman.

35:18.550 --> 35:20.677
She never told me who,

35:20.710 --> 35:24.180
but she did say she was
pushing her to get a divorce.

35:32.230 --> 35:33.629
WATSON: How'd it go
with Amanda Neal?

35:33.660 --> 35:35.252
I don't believe
she's our killer.

35:35.300 --> 35:37.427
How's it going with the
case files of Zoe Mercado?

35:37.460 --> 35:38.825
Well, from the looks of things,

35:38.870 --> 35:40.269
there were at least
a few dozen people

35:40.300 --> 35:41.665
in Connecticut law enforcement

35:41.700 --> 35:43.497
who knew what
she was up to.

35:43.540 --> 35:45.508
They'd either specifically
request her to process evidence,

35:45.540 --> 35:48.930
or they would ask her to repeat
a test done by a subordinate

35:48.980 --> 35:50.470
to get a better result.

35:50.510 --> 35:52.307
You already know who we're
looking for, don't you?

35:52.350 --> 35:54.318
As a matter of fact,
I believe I do.

35:54.350 --> 35:56.511
That's nice.

35:56.550 --> 35:58.211
I got there 20 minutes ago.

36:08.500 --> 36:09.899
Can I help you?

36:09.930 --> 36:11.898
I'm Detective Bell
with the NYPD.

36:11.930 --> 36:13.898
This is Detective Gould
with the Avon PD.

36:13.930 --> 36:16.899
Does Assistant District Attorney
Christa Pullman live here?

36:16.940 --> 36:19.204
She's my wife.
Is everything okay?

36:19.240 --> 36:20.400
She's fine.

36:20.440 --> 36:21.805
My colleagues
and I are here

36:21.840 --> 36:23.979
about a college student
named Marissa Kagan.

36:24.010 --> 36:25.978
Does that name
ring a bell?

36:26.010 --> 36:28.274
It was tragic,
what happened to her.

36:28.320 --> 36:30.242
Actually, that's what
we're here to talk about.

36:30.280 --> 36:31.884
The kids are at school.

36:31.920 --> 36:33.182
Come in.

36:36.460 --> 36:38.428
I don't understand.

36:38.460 --> 36:40.826
Marissa's murder
was solved years ago.

36:40.860 --> 36:43.420
It was that stalker, that boy
she went to school with.

36:43.460 --> 36:45.826
We now think
Louis Bowman was framed

36:45.870 --> 36:47.667
and that the person
who did it

36:47.700 --> 36:50.396
also recently shot and killed
a young woman in the Bronx.

36:50.440 --> 36:53.261
That's horrible.

36:53.310 --> 36:55.335
But shouldn't you be talking
to Christa about this?

36:55.380 --> 36:56.608
She'll be home in a few hours.

36:56.640 --> 36:58.005
WATSON:
We will.

36:58.040 --> 37:00.008
We've recently become
aware of a suspect

37:00.050 --> 37:02.018
that the police never pursued,

37:02.050 --> 37:04.689
a married woman with whom
Marissa was havmg an affair.

37:06.450 --> 37:08.850
A witness reports seeing
Marissa's lover wearing

37:08.890 --> 37:11.620
a very distinctive
green-and-white Baja sweater.

37:13.030 --> 37:14.349
Any idea who that might be?

37:16.360 --> 37:18.328
Christa has a sweater like that.

37:18.370 --> 37:20.497
Did you know
about the affair?

37:20.530 --> 37:22.669
I found out.

37:22.700 --> 37:24.839
BELL:
Your wife's failure to disclose

37:24.870 --> 37:26.667
her relationship
to the victim at trial

37:26.710 --> 37:28.871
is gonna be enough for
Avon PD to get a warrant.

37:28.910 --> 37:32.277
Someone's gonna be here shortly
to collect samples of her DNA.

37:32.310 --> 37:34.312
Her toothbrush,
her hairbrush should do.

37:37.420 --> 37:39.411
They can take
whatever they need.

37:40.420 --> 37:42.513
But first...

37:42.560 --> 37:44.926
there's something else
you should know.

37:46.660 --> 37:48.628
My personal attorney
is on her way over.

37:48.660 --> 37:51.390
I'm not going to discuss any
of this until she gets here.

37:51.430 --> 37:52.795
That's all right.

37:52.830 --> 37:54.798
We don't really need
to ask any questions.

37:54.840 --> 37:56.694
Your wife already
confessed to everything.

37:56.740 --> 37:58.708
What?
GREGSON: Please.

37:58.740 --> 37:59.729
Sit.

38:06.650 --> 38:09.619
We know that you and Marissa
were having an affair

38:09.650 --> 38:12.448
and that your wife,
Teri, found out.

38:12.490 --> 38:16.017
She confront_ed_ Marissa
over your infidelity,

38:16.060 --> 38:19.427
and that confrontation ended
in Marissa's murder.

38:19.460 --> 38:21.621
WATSON: When Teri got home,
she told you what she had done.

38:21.660 --> 38:23.025
She was ready to face
the consequences

38:23.060 --> 38:25.665
and turn herself in,
but you told her not to,

38:25.700 --> 38:27.327
that you would
take care of everything.

38:27.370 --> 38:30.692
GREGSON: And you did,
you made sure that Zoe Mercado

38:30.740 --> 38:35.109
was the one who tested
the saliva on Marissa's body,

38:35.140 --> 38:38.576
and, like you expected,
she matched it to Louis Bowman.

38:38.610 --> 38:40.498
You thought that was
the end of it.

38:40.550 --> 38:43.917
But then, a few weeks ago,
Phoebe Elliot contacted you.

38:43.950 --> 38:46.646
She told you what she'd seen
in that blown-up selfie

38:46.690 --> 38:48.453
in Ephraim Hill's gallery.

38:48.490 --> 38:50.708
She said it seemed to
corroborate Bowman's alibi.

38:50.760 --> 38:53.581
HOLMES:
You shared this with your wife,

38:53.630 --> 38:55.598
and according to her,
you once again promised

38:55.630 --> 38:57.598
to "handle" everything.

38:57.630 --> 38:59.598
You tried to convince Phoebe,
as you did me,

38:59.630 --> 39:01.598
that the photograph
wasn't reliable.

39:01.640 --> 39:05.667
When that failed, Teri says she
took matters into her own hands.

39:05.710 --> 39:07.359
First, you replaced Phoebe's
selfie with a forgery.

39:07.410 --> 39:08.832
Then, the next night,

39:08.880 --> 39:10.734
she went to a restaurant
near your home in Avon

39:10.780 --> 39:12.941
and stole a car
out of the valet lot.

39:12.980 --> 39:14.948
Then she drove to Phoebe's
gym in the Bronx,

39:14.980 --> 39:17.619
waited for her and shot her.

39:17.650 --> 39:19.743
GREGSON: We've got a signed
confession from your wife

39:19.790 --> 39:22.156
admitting to the burglary at
the gallery and to the murders

39:22.190 --> 39:25.751
of Marissa Kagan
and Phoebe Elliot.

39:25.790 --> 39:27.758
No.

39:27.790 --> 39:29.758
No, you coerced this.

39:29.800 --> 39:31.859
I can get this thrown out.

39:31.900 --> 39:34.494
Your wife's confession
was entirely voluntary.

39:34.540 --> 39:37.532
We've got it in writing
and on tape.

39:37.570 --> 39:39.765
There was a time when that would
have been the end of the matter,

39:39.810 --> 39:42.529
but ex-lab supervisor
Zoe Mercado is right

39:42.580 --> 39:45.777
about one thing: juries do not
like to convict these days

39:45.810 --> 39:48.472
without DNA evidence,
so we retested

39:48.520 --> 39:51.148
the saliva found on Marissa's
shirt three years ago

39:51.180 --> 39:52.613
just to be certain.

39:52.650 --> 39:54.515
It's a preliminary
match for Teri.

39:54.560 --> 39:55.879
GREGSON: There isn't much doubt
she killed Marissa,

39:55.920 --> 39:57.717
but Phoebe Elliot?

39:57.760 --> 39:59.489
That's another story.

39:59.530 --> 40:01.794
BELL:
We compared Teri's DNA

40:01.830 --> 40:04.867
to skin cells recovered from
the car used in Phoebe's murder.

40:06.730 --> 40:10.530
If ex-lab supervisor Zoe Mercado
or anyone of her ilk

40:10.570 --> 40:12.561
had performed those tests,

40:12.610 --> 40:14.202
they would have rightly
come back a match.

40:14.240 --> 40:16.208
But in this case,
we didn't inform the lab

40:16.240 --> 40:18.447
which DNA belonged
to our suspect.

40:18.480 --> 40:21.449
We provided several samples
from your home,

40:21.480 --> 40:24.688
samples from other suspects,
like Keith Elliot, Ephraim Hill.

40:24.720 --> 40:26.085
Even threw in a sample
from my tortoise

40:26.120 --> 40:27.712
just to keep them on their toes.

40:27.750 --> 40:29.718
And imagine our surprise
when the lab revealed

40:29.760 --> 40:33.025
that the DNA in the car
didn't belong to your wife,

40:33.060 --> 40:35.551
it belonged to you.

40:35.600 --> 40:38.569
You knew Phoebe's
brother had a record.

40:38.600 --> 40:40.568
With his history,
it was a matter of time

40:40.600 --> 40:41.999
before we zeroed in on him.

40:42.040 --> 40:44.838
And with a little nudge,
Zoe would attribute

40:44.870 --> 40:47.839
any physical evidence found
to him and not you.

40:47.870 --> 40:52.239
WATSON: Teri felt responsible
for the whole chain of events.

40:52.280 --> 40:54.669
So to protect you
and to leave your children

40:54.720 --> 40:56.711
with at least one parent
not in prison,

40:56.750 --> 40:59.514
she tried to take
the blame for both crimes.

40:59.550 --> 41:01.518
Fortunately for them,

41:01.560 --> 41:04.017
we understand they have
very loving grandparents.

41:04.060 --> 41:07.188
Unfortunately for you,

41:07.230 --> 41:09.198
when lab work is done right,

41:09.230 --> 41:12.199
without bias,
without assumption,

41:12.230 --> 41:15.529
it really does tend to convince
a jury of a killer's guilt.

41:18.000 --> 41:19.604
LIN:
This is gonna sell quickly,

41:19.640 --> 41:21.039
_ so let me know
if you're interested.

41:28.650 --> 41:30.641
Looking for a place of your own?

41:30.680 --> 41:32.682
Can't beat the location.

41:32.720 --> 41:35.689
Your office said you'd be here.

41:35.720 --> 41:40.521
I called your mother today,
and we spoke for a while.

41:40.560 --> 41:42.596
Your Mandarin must be good.

41:42.630 --> 41:44.291
No, she seems nice.

41:44.330 --> 41:46.662
She's the best.

41:46.700 --> 41:47.962
She invited me to tea.

41:48.000 --> 41:49.888
I'm not surprised.

41:49.940 --> 41:52.602
I took a rain check.

41:52.640 --> 41:55.609
Look, I know this
has been a lot for you.

41:55.640 --> 41:58.609
It's been a lot for me, too.

41:58.650 --> 42:01.619
And I just thought,
"Why rush it?"

42:01.650 --> 42:06.314
I'll have tea with your mother
when you're ready to join us.

42:06.350 --> 42:08.580
Why?

42:10.620 --> 42:12.588
Because you're my sister.
