Glenn Miller played ¶           

00:05.639 --> 00:09.273
            ¶ Songs that made   
            The Hit Parade ¶    

00:09.275 --> 00:12.943
¶ Guys like us                  
We had it made ¶                

00:12.946 --> 00:16.213
    ¶ Those were the days ¶     

00:16.216 --> 00:19.283
           <i>¶ And you knew</i>       
           <i>Where you were then ¶</i>

00:19.285 --> 00:23.622
 <i>¶ Girls were girls</i>             
 <i>And men were men ¶</i>             

00:23.624 --> 00:30.128

00:57.657 --> 00:59.758
          Ma, you still working 
          on that jigsaw puzzle?

00:59.760 --> 01:00.759
    Yeah.                       

01:00.761 --> 01:02.093
            You've been at it   
            for weeks.          

01:02.095 --> 01:04.696
Oh, this is                     
a hard one, Mike.               

01:04.697 --> 01:06.064
                  What made you 
                  pick this one?

01:06.066 --> 01:07.598
              Because of        
              the way it'll look

01:07.600 --> 01:09.100
             when it's all done.

01:09.102 --> 01:10.101
              See?              

01:10.103 --> 01:12.303
    A delicious pizza.          

01:15.107 --> 01:17.142
I don't know how you have       
the patience for this.          

01:17.144 --> 01:18.943
To me, one piece of pizza       
looks like another.             

01:18.945 --> 01:21.312
            That's what         
            makes it so hard.   

01:21.314 --> 01:24.916
  The last puzzle I worked on   
    was much easier--           

01:24.918 --> 01:28.386
     Arthur Godfrey making      
 his horse, Goldie, kneel down. 

01:30.289 --> 01:31.556
Why was that easier?            

01:31.558 --> 01:34.492
      Because I could tell      
  which one was Arthur Godfrey  

01:34.494 --> 01:36.961
  and which one was the horse.  

01:39.732 --> 01:41.099
What's for dinner?              

01:41.101 --> 01:43.301
                Oh, Mike,       
                nothing special.

01:43.303 --> 01:44.836
          You see, Archie called

01:44.838 --> 01:47.038
              and said something
              important came up 

01:47.040 --> 01:49.473
          and he wouldn't be    
          eating dinner tonight.

01:49.475 --> 01:50.675
Yeah? What's going on?          

01:50.677 --> 01:53.544
        I don't know, but       
        it must be something,   

01:53.546 --> 01:55.279
                because the only
                other time      

01:55.281 --> 01:57.448
              I remember Archie 
              missing his dinner

01:57.450 --> 01:59.050
            was once when       
            he slept through it.

02:01.286 --> 02:02.587
  Why didn't you wake him up?   

02:02.589 --> 02:04.222
                 Oh, I couldn't.

02:04.224 --> 02:05.724
        We was on our honeymoon.

02:05.726 --> 02:07.792
  I didn't know him well enough.

02:10.495 --> 02:12.296
         Whoop-dee-doo          
    and how do you do!          

02:12.298 --> 02:13.297
EDITH: Oh!                      
            Ah-hah!             

02:13.299 --> 02:15.399
         Hello, Archie.         

02:15.401 --> 02:17.035
                 Oh, what a day.
                 What a day!    

02:17.037 --> 02:19.370
                     What a day!

02:19.372 --> 02:20.404
                 ¶ How's life? ¶

02:20.406 --> 02:23.108
            ¶ It's just         
            A bowl of cherries ¶

02:23.110 --> 02:25.043
¶ Don't take it serious ¶       

02:25.045 --> 02:27.011
     ¶ It's so mysterious ¶     

02:27.013 --> 02:29.080
                 Archie, are you
                 all right?     

02:29.082 --> 02:30.648
        No, Edith.              

02:30.650 --> 02:34.452
      I'm singing because       
I just got hit by a Mack truck. 

02:34.454 --> 02:36.621
    Certainly I'm all right.    
        I'm very happy.         

02:36.623 --> 02:38.623
This is one of the greatest days
          of my life.           

02:38.625 --> 02:39.624
            That's wonderful.   

02:39.626 --> 02:40.625
What is it?                     

02:40.627 --> 02:42.627
            Oh, boy,            
            sensational news.   

02:42.629 --> 02:43.628
                Are youse ready?

02:43.630 --> 02:45.263
    Yeah, I can hardly wait.    

02:45.265 --> 02:47.298
     Remember Hank Phillips     
     from the gas station?      

02:47.300 --> 02:48.299
Yeah.                           

02:48.301 --> 02:49.667
        He's dead.              

02:52.037 --> 02:55.106
                Oh, my...       

02:55.108 --> 02:58.042
A guy dies,                     
and you're happy?               

02:58.044 --> 03:01.646
    Will you wait a minute?     
    I didn't say that.          

03:01.648 --> 03:05.616
 I'm only happy because the guy 
can't bowl no more, that's all. 

03:05.618 --> 03:07.118
See, I'm waiting six years      

03:07.120 --> 03:09.754
         to get a spot          
 on this special bowling team,  

03:09.756 --> 03:13.524
            and now             
there's a spot opened up.       

03:13.526 --> 03:16.227
I'm sorry the guy is dead,      
        but that's life.        

03:17.663 --> 03:19.430
Archie, will you                
listen to yourself?             

03:19.432 --> 03:21.032
You're saying that              
getting on a bowling team       

03:21.034 --> 03:22.566
is more important               
than a man's life!              

03:22.568 --> 03:24.936
                I am going      
                to ignore you   

03:24.938 --> 03:27.371
         on the grounds that,   
         one, I didn't say that,

03:27.373 --> 03:30.141
    and two, I wasn't talking   
    to you when I said that.    

03:31.443 --> 03:33.678
        Edith, you know         
    what I got here for you?    

03:33.680 --> 03:34.679
No.                             

03:34.681 --> 03:37.282
New laces for my bowling shoes. 

03:37.284 --> 03:38.349
Oh.                             

03:38.351 --> 03:40.351
 Now, I want you to take these  

03:40.353 --> 03:41.986
          and put 'em           
in the bowling shoes, see?      

03:41.988 --> 03:43.788
         And make sure          
  that the ends come out even   

03:43.790 --> 03:45.890
         because I want         
     to tie a perfect bow.      

03:45.892 --> 03:47.358
Everything tonight counts.      

03:47.360 --> 03:50.661
Archie, I ain't never           
seen you so excited             

03:50.663 --> 03:52.563
about going bowling.            

03:52.565 --> 03:54.732
             Edith, it ain't    
             just going bowling.

03:54.734 --> 03:57.202
          I got to try out      
          against two other guys

03:57.204 --> 03:59.637
        for this spot, see,     
        on the Cannonballers.   

03:59.639 --> 04:01.239
            The greatest team   
            in the league.      

04:01.241 --> 04:02.907
    Now, go on.                 
    Get my shoes, right away.   

04:02.909 --> 04:05.844
  Will you get out of my way?   

04:05.846 --> 04:06.978
              The Cannonballers?

04:06.980 --> 04:08.346
That's right, buddy,            
the Cannonballers,              

04:08.348 --> 04:11.015
and when you say that name,     
say it with a little respect,   

04:11.017 --> 04:12.817
because them guys               
is the cream of the crop.       

04:12.819 --> 04:14.618
They're the top bananas...      
the pick of the litter.         

04:14.620 --> 04:15.954
                    Whoopee.    
Get away from me!               

04:17.822 --> 04:20.558
Archie, how do you              
want me to lace these?          

04:20.560 --> 04:23.461
Through the holes, Edith,       
    through the holes.          

04:24.830 --> 04:29.400
No. I mean, do you want me      
to lace them over or under?     

04:29.402 --> 04:30.401
          What's the difference?

04:30.403 --> 04:31.535
Well, you see,                  

04:31.537 --> 04:34.172
if you lace them over,          
they show more and--            

04:34.174 --> 04:35.406
                          Edith.

04:35.408 --> 04:37.408
         I didn't say,          
         "What's the difference?

04:37.410 --> 04:38.809
              Explain it to me."

04:38.811 --> 04:40.945
 I said, "What's the difference?
 Who the hell cares?"           

04:40.947 --> 04:43.982
Oh, I'm sorry, Archie,          
I misunderstood you.            

04:43.984 --> 04:45.483
You see, when you said--        

04:45.485 --> 04:47.852
        Will you stifle yourself
        and lace these shoes?   

04:47.854 --> 04:49.254
Yeah.                           

04:49.256 --> 04:50.821
         We ain't got much time.

04:50.823 --> 04:52.723
    Moose Hansen, the captain   
    of the Cannonballers,       

04:52.725 --> 04:54.525
    is coming over any minute   
    to pick me up               

04:54.527 --> 04:55.793
      and take me to the alleys.

04:55.795 --> 04:57.795
         Moose Hansen?          

04:58.964 --> 05:01.599
  That's right, Moose Hansen.   

05:01.601 --> 05:04.035
     The most respected guy     
  in the whole bowling league.  

05:04.037 --> 05:05.469
  What makes him so respected?  

05:05.471 --> 05:08.172
  What makes him so respected?  
    The kind of a guy he is.    

05:08.174 --> 05:09.473
 I'll give you a for instance.  

05:09.475 --> 05:11.742
  One night, Moose, heh, heh,   
        is standing out         

05:11.744 --> 05:14.245
 in front of the bowling alley  
      on the street there.      

05:14.247 --> 05:15.914
     He's having an argument    
        with some jerk,         

05:15.916 --> 05:18.983
     and this jerk comes up     
with his final point, see?      

05:18.985 --> 05:21.252
         And he thinks          
he's really put the Moose away. 

05:21.254 --> 05:22.453
 You know what the Moose done?  

05:22.455 --> 05:23.754
                        What?   

05:23.756 --> 05:25.623
  He went and pulled the door   
    off the guy's car.          

05:29.128 --> 05:31.462
      An intelligent man.       

05:31.464 --> 05:33.965
          Damn right.           

05:33.967 --> 05:35.266
         I'll tell you          
      about another time.       

05:35.268 --> 05:36.467
 Moose is at the bowling alley. 

05:36.469 --> 05:38.536
     He wanted to telephone     
      his wife, you know?       

05:38.538 --> 05:40.071
  He gets to the phone booth,   

05:40.073 --> 05:43.107
there's some weirdo-creepo      
 in there and he won't get out, 

05:43.109 --> 05:44.575
so Moose taps on the door.      

05:44.577 --> 05:46.444
        The weirdo pays,        
      like, no attention.       

05:46.446 --> 05:47.511
You know what Moose done?       

05:47.513 --> 05:50.148
        He tore the door        
      off the phone booth.      

05:50.150 --> 05:52.883
         Did I tell you         
    this story before?          

05:55.120 --> 05:58.456
    No, but what else would     
a bright, rational, tactful man 

05:58.458 --> 06:00.024
    like the Moose do?          

06:00.026 --> 06:01.759
What do you mean by that?       

06:01.761 --> 06:03.394
            I mean,             
your friend is a bonehead.      

06:03.396 --> 06:05.430
    Cut that out, you!          

06:05.432 --> 06:07.498
And I don't want to hear        
any talk like that              

06:07.500 --> 06:08.499
when Moose Hansen               
gets here,                      

06:08.501 --> 06:09.633
because getting                 
on the Cannonballers            

06:09.635 --> 06:10.901
means a lot to me.              

06:10.903 --> 06:12.337
Hurry up with the shoes,        
huh, Edith?                     

06:12.339 --> 06:15.306
What are you going to say       
    to Barney Hefner?           

06:15.308 --> 06:16.707
                     About what?

06:16.709 --> 06:19.277
  Well, you always go bowling   
  with him on Tuesday nights.   

06:19.279 --> 06:22.680
  Oh, well, this Tuesday night  
     is something special.      

06:22.682 --> 06:24.983
         I got to keep          
         my mind on my game now,

06:24.985 --> 06:27.251
         because I gotta bowl   
         against two other guys,

06:27.253 --> 06:28.719
         and I got to beat them.

06:28.721 --> 06:30.754
            And then            
  they'll put you on the team?  

06:30.756 --> 06:32.857
That's right. Well...yeah.      

06:32.859 --> 06:35.460
But bowling ain't the only thing
  to get on the Cannonballers.  

06:35.462 --> 06:36.894
    You've got to be, uh...     

06:36.896 --> 06:39.297
  Well, you know what I mean--  
     a special kind of guy.     

06:39.299 --> 06:41.432
         Wait a second.         
      Special kind of guy?      

06:41.434 --> 06:43.134
            What are you saying?

06:43.136 --> 06:45.003
I'm saying                      
that the Cannonballers          

06:45.005 --> 06:47.838
is all cut                      
from the same hunk of cloth.    

06:47.840 --> 06:49.040
They're all the same.           

06:49.042 --> 06:51.142
They don't want                 
no different guys mixing in.    

06:51.144 --> 06:52.143
Know what I mean?               
                        Yeah.   

06:52.145 --> 06:53.211
        I know what you mean.   

06:53.213 --> 06:54.412
            The Cannonballers   
            are restricted.     

06:54.414 --> 06:56.981
I never said that.              

06:56.983 --> 06:59.850
All I'm saying is they're, uh,  
what do you call...careful.     

06:59.852 --> 07:01.219
      Arch, it's discrimination,

07:01.221 --> 07:03.254
          keeping a guy out     
          because of what he is.

07:03.256 --> 07:05.789
They don't keep nobody out      
because of what he is!          

07:05.791 --> 07:08.026
They keep a guy out maybe       
because of what he ain't.       

07:10.029 --> 07:12.363
Like for instance,              
if he ain't a good bowler,      

07:12.365 --> 07:13.998
he ain't getting in...          

07:14.000 --> 07:15.833
and if he ain't white           
and Protestant...               

07:18.070 --> 07:20.104
What could be fairer than that? 

07:20.106 --> 07:22.273
     Letting anybody in,        
     no matter what color he is,

07:22.275 --> 07:23.707
  no matter what religion he is!

07:23.709 --> 07:25.410
      That's what this country's
      supposed to be about!     

07:25.412 --> 07:27.611
Get outta here! That's only     
for the civil service.          

07:29.981 --> 07:30.981
            Your regular people,

07:30.983 --> 07:32.783
            they all want to be 
            with their own kind.

07:32.785 --> 07:33.918
    That's a well-known fact.   

07:33.920 --> 07:35.520
        Look it up if           
        you don't believe me.   

07:35.522 --> 07:36.521
                I'll give you   
                an example.     

07:36.523 --> 07:38.389
              Take your coloreds
              up in Harlem.     

07:38.391 --> 07:40.158
Are you saying black people     
live in Harlem                  

07:40.160 --> 07:41.492
because they want to?           

07:41.494 --> 07:44.062
          Certainly. It's a free
          country, ain't it?    

07:44.064 --> 07:45.363
  They're all up there together.

07:45.365 --> 07:47.798
  They all understand           
  their own kind of lingo there.

07:47.800 --> 07:49.100
And it's easier for them too.   

07:49.102 --> 07:50.201
              I'll tell you how.

07:50.203 --> 07:51.802
        Suppose a relative      
        comes up from the South,

07:51.804 --> 07:53.104
        wants to see his family.

07:53.106 --> 07:58.008
        He don't have to go     
        searching all over town.

07:58.010 --> 08:00.411
    All he's got to do is go up,
    stand on the corner         

08:00.413 --> 08:01.612
            of 125th Street     
            and Lenox Avenue,   

08:01.614 --> 08:02.746
        and the family turns up.

08:04.616 --> 08:06.016
            You know, Arch,     
            it's a good thing   

08:06.018 --> 08:07.418
                you never listen
                to what you say.

08:07.420 --> 08:08.786
                Because if your 
                brain ever heard

08:08.788 --> 08:10.588
     what your mouth was saying,
     you'd cut your throat.     

08:10.590 --> 08:12.823
Get away from me!               

08:12.825 --> 08:13.958
                  Hi, everybody.

08:13.960 --> 08:15.359
EDITH: Hi, Gloria.              
        Oh, hi, honey.          

08:15.361 --> 08:16.527
  I'm sorry I'm late, Michael,  

08:16.529 --> 08:17.928
                 but I stopped  
                 on the way home

08:17.930 --> 08:18.929
        to buy you a present.   

08:18.931 --> 08:19.930
Hey, what's the occasion?       

08:19.932 --> 08:21.466
                  The occasion  
                  is I love you.

08:22.667 --> 08:26.437
 Oh, Archie, ain't that sweet?  

08:26.439 --> 08:29.440
No. It makes me sick.           

08:31.110 --> 08:32.510
When are they going             
to start behaving               

08:32.511 --> 08:34.812
like married people?            

08:36.014 --> 08:37.315
              Open your present,
              Michael.          

08:37.317 --> 08:39.583
             Okay.              

08:39.586 --> 08:42.852
          A present...          
 She never buys me no presents. 

08:42.855 --> 08:45.590
  Hey, Gloria, this is great.   

08:52.797 --> 08:53.998
                  Hey, it's just
                  what I need   

08:54.000 --> 08:55.199
                to keep         
                all my stuff in.

08:55.201 --> 08:57.435
          Oh, Archie,           
     ain't that beautiful?      

08:57.437 --> 09:01.239
    Holy cow, a purse!          

09:04.176 --> 09:08.546
Oh, that's just gorgeous there.

        Did you buy him         
      matching pantyhose?       

09:13.952 --> 09:16.454
      You're really sick.       

09:16.456 --> 09:18.656
        Archie, this is a bag   
        to carry things in.     

09:18.658 --> 09:20.158
         What's wrong with that?

09:20.160 --> 09:22.527
If you don't know, buddy,       
  I'll spell it out for you.

09:26.865 --> 09:28.399
      There you go again.       

09:28.401 --> 09:30.501
  Just because something looks  
 a little bit different to you, 

09:30.503 --> 09:32.470
        you have to put         
     a label on it, right?      

09:32.472 --> 09:35.906
        [LISPING] Well,         
  if the purse fits, wear it.

             Daddy!             

09:40.346 --> 09:42.846
Don't you see how practical     
this bag is for men?            

09:42.848 --> 09:44.582
It'd be great even for you.     

09:44.584 --> 09:46.884
I mean, instead of stuffing     
your pockets out of shape       

09:46.886 --> 09:48.886
with your keys                  
and your wallet and your cigars,

09:48.888 --> 09:50.788
you could put everything        
in just one bag.                

09:50.790 --> 09:54.192
     No man wears a purse.

          Case closed.          

09:55.261 --> 09:59.330
         In olden days,         
    lots of men wore purses.    

09:59.332 --> 10:00.831
         Ah, like who?          

10:00.833 --> 10:02.366

11:47.906 --> 11:49.707
And this is my lovely daughter, 
Gloria, over here.              

11:49.709 --> 11:51.275
                Say hello       
                to the Moose.   
            Hi.                 

11:51.277 --> 11:52.710
                  How do you do?

11:52.712 --> 11:54.945
              You all set, Arch?
Oh, am I all set!               

11:54.947 --> 11:57.715
  Yeah. Just let me get my hat  
     and coat here, Moose.      

11:57.717 --> 11:58.916
 I got all the equipment ready, 

11:58.918 --> 12:01.118
the ball is all polished up     
there in the bag,               

12:01.120 --> 12:02.586
new laces in the shoes          
and everything.                 

12:02.588 --> 12:03.987
And I want                      
to tell you something,          

12:03.989 --> 12:05.189
this means a lot to me.         

12:05.191 --> 12:06.990
I mean, not only bowling        
with the Cannonballers,         

12:06.992 --> 12:08.192
but I'm looking forward,        
you know,                       

12:08.194 --> 12:09.193
to them monthly smokers...      

12:09.195 --> 12:10.328
     Hey, Arch, come here.      

12:10.330 --> 12:11.895
              Hey, Moose! That's
              my elbow there.   

12:11.897 --> 12:14.097
          That ain't a car door.
          That's flesh and bone.

12:14.099 --> 12:16.500
  Hey, those monthly smokers.   

12:16.502 --> 12:18.168
        You know,               
 that's a Cannonballer secret.  

12:18.170 --> 12:20.638
    Who told you about that?    
                  Hank Phillips.

12:20.640 --> 12:23.874
You know he could get kicked out
  for that if he wasn't dead?   

12:25.677 --> 12:28.713
      Hey, this shirt goes great
      with my new bag, huh?     

12:28.715 --> 12:30.514
                        Ah...   

12:39.624 --> 12:41.925
Who's this, Arch,               
your other daughter?            

12:44.629 --> 12:45.796
            Moose, I'm sorry.   

12:45.798 --> 12:47.565
            That's my daughter's
            husband over there. 

12:47.567 --> 12:49.233
            Please, don't       
            look at him, huh?   

12:49.235 --> 12:50.368
        Come on, we'd better go.

12:50.370 --> 12:51.869
                  We gotta be   
                  there in time.

12:51.871 --> 12:54.104
I don't want to be late         
for the match, Moose.           

12:54.106 --> 12:56.741
          Yeah...yeah.          

12:56.743 --> 13:00.411
Thanks for helping me out there,
        Michelle.               

13:09.754 --> 13:11.755
         Just get in. Come on.  
         Just get in, all right?

13:11.757 --> 13:12.823
             [WHISTLING OUTSIDE]

13:12.825 --> 13:14.458
            Hey, why don't you  
            idiots grow up, huh?

13:18.897 --> 13:20.064
                What's so funny?

13:20.066 --> 13:22.967
You are, getting so angry       
at some boys whistling.         

13:22.969 --> 13:24.434
          Well, I don't like it.

13:24.436 --> 13:25.569
     I don't mind, Michael.     

13:25.571 --> 13:27.370
I take it                       
as a compliment.                

13:27.372 --> 13:29.172
            Gloria, they weren't
            whistling at you.   

13:29.174 --> 13:31.041
                They were       
                whistling at me.

13:34.846 --> 13:38.381
             Hey, why don't     
             you idiots grow up?

13:40.619 --> 13:42.052
                Hey, Michael.   

13:42.054 --> 13:44.054
  Why don't you help Ma and me  
        with the puzzle?        

13:44.056 --> 13:46.356
          All right. I just want
          to make a phone call. 

13:46.358 --> 13:47.925
EDITH:                          
Archie!                         

13:47.927 --> 13:51.194
     How did everything go?     

13:51.196 --> 13:52.830
             Edith, Edith, uh...

13:52.832 --> 13:55.198
          I don't...I don't     
          want to talk about it.

13:55.200 --> 13:58.168
Oh, Archie, I'm sorry.          

13:58.170 --> 13:59.703
You didn't make                 
the team.                       

13:59.705 --> 14:02.272
    Edith, I didn't say that.   

14:02.274 --> 14:04.074
        What, are you trying    
        to jinx me or something?

14:04.076 --> 14:06.744
          I just said I didn't  
          want to talk about it.

14:06.746 --> 14:07.745
                  Hey, hey, you.

14:07.747 --> 14:09.146
        Hey, hey,               
    what are you doing here?    

14:09.148 --> 14:11.281
      Put down the phone.       
      Put down the phone.       

14:11.283 --> 14:15.019
            Put down the phone! 
            Put down that phone!

14:15.021 --> 14:17.021
I got a crazy man here.         
I'll call you back.             

14:17.023 --> 14:19.589
            Put down that phone!
            Put down that phone!

14:19.591 --> 14:20.624
It's down!                      

14:20.626 --> 14:22.059
                  Leave it down.

14:22.061 --> 14:23.326
         I got a call coming in.

14:23.328 --> 14:26.329
Well, I had a call going out.   

14:26.331 --> 14:28.032
 I don't want to argue with you.

14:28.034 --> 14:30.067
You might have cost me          
membership in the Cannonballers,

14:30.069 --> 14:32.102
              wearing that purse
              of yours tonight. 

14:32.104 --> 14:34.938
     Daddy, what happened?      
Why are you in such a bad mood? 

14:34.940 --> 14:36.106
            Listen, little girl.

14:36.108 --> 14:37.708
          I don't want          
to argue with you neither.      

14:37.710 --> 14:39.143
          I don't want          
     to argue with nobody.      

14:39.145 --> 14:40.778
            Can't youse all tell
            when a guy is...    

14:40.780 --> 14:42.079
             what do you call...
             tensed up?         

14:42.081 --> 14:43.847
            Now, just leave me  
            alone, all of youse.

14:43.849 --> 14:44.882
                Get over here   

14:44.884 --> 14:47.184
            and do the jigsaw   
            puzzle or something.

14:54.726 --> 14:55.993
                          Edith.

14:55.995 --> 14:57.961
 What are you doing over there? 

14:57.963 --> 14:59.429
     Don't you want to hear     
         what happened?         

15:01.700 --> 15:04.802
          You said you wanted us
          to leave you alone.   

15:04.804 --> 15:06.203
         Get over here.         

15:08.073 --> 15:10.373
                    Sit down.   

15:10.375 --> 15:12.375
             Let me tell you    
             what happened, see?

15:12.377 --> 15:13.577
                There's three   
                of us bowling   

15:13.579 --> 15:15.212
              for the same spot,
              see? All right.   

15:15.214 --> 15:17.447
                  Doug Simmons, 
                  he goes first.

15:17.449 --> 15:19.850
      Now, this is a guy, Edith,
      who never in his life,    

15:19.852 --> 15:22.019
            the bum, ever bowled
            over 155.           

15:22.021 --> 15:25.589
    Now, tonight, he goes crazy.
    He bowls 167.               

15:25.591 --> 15:27.290
    I'm watching him,           
    and I'm sweating bullets,   

15:27.292 --> 15:28.726
                 I'm so nervous.

15:28.728 --> 15:31.762
 Now, this is where Moose Hansen
 does an awful nice thing.      

15:31.764 --> 15:33.663
         He comes over, puts his
         arm around my shoulder.

15:33.665 --> 15:36.834
  He says, "Hey, Arch, don't get
  your bowels in an uproar."    

15:42.006 --> 15:43.573
            Now, you know,      
            a thing like that   

15:43.575 --> 15:45.242
          is bound to give a guy
          courage, you know?    

15:46.811 --> 15:47.811
                        So...   

15:47.813 --> 15:49.146
                I'm next, right?

15:49.148 --> 15:50.347
          I jump up on the line.

15:50.349 --> 15:52.349
I grab my ball.                 
I start in bowling.             

15:52.351 --> 15:54.384
Wham-bam, I bowl 172--          

15:54.386 --> 15:56.220
not my best,                    
but very good, right?           

15:56.222 --> 15:58.188
Now, Charlie Green,             
the last guy, comes up.         

15:58.190 --> 16:00.590
I don't think much of him,      
but you know what he does?      

16:00.592 --> 16:02.960
First two frames...one, two,    
two strikes in a row.           

16:02.962 --> 16:04.161
I can't look no more.           

16:04.163 --> 16:07.030
I says to Doug Simmons,         
"Doug, you watch the game,      

16:07.032 --> 16:08.632
"and then tell me               
how it comes out,               

16:08.634 --> 16:09.633
because I can't stay here."     

16:09.635 --> 16:11.434
And I run like hell             
out of the alleys.              

16:11.436 --> 16:13.403
          And now you're waiting
          for Doug to call you? 

16:13.405 --> 16:15.272
Yeah, oh, Edith,                
Edith, jeez.                    

16:15.274 --> 16:17.274
        I want to get on        
 the Cannonballers team so bad, 

16:17.276 --> 16:18.275
                 I can taste it.

16:18.277 --> 16:20.577
Oh, I know, Archie.             

16:20.579 --> 16:21.979
                 Oh, I forgot   
                 to tell you too

16:21.981 --> 16:23.647
        about the bowling shirts
        the Cannonballers have--

16:23.649 --> 16:25.615
             a gorgeous         
             yellow silk, Edith,

16:25.617 --> 16:28.018
  with red piping on the sleeves
  and up here at the neck.      

16:28.020 --> 16:29.753
And you look good in yellow.    

16:29.755 --> 16:31.889
    Yeah, I look good in yellow.

16:31.891 --> 16:34.158
  And on the back,              
  they got a picture of a cannon

16:34.160 --> 16:36.860
         firing a bowling ball  
         against pins, you know?

16:36.862 --> 16:38.862
    Well, when you got something
    like that on your back,     

16:38.864 --> 16:39.863
you really know you're somebody.

16:39.865 --> 16:41.631
    Yeah.                       

16:41.633 --> 16:43.066
And in a shirt like that,       

16:43.068 --> 16:45.903
I could always find you         
in a crowd.                     

16:45.905 --> 16:47.171
                        Yeah.   

16:47.173 --> 16:48.638
         They weren't forgetting
         the front neither,     

16:48.640 --> 16:50.240
      because on the front      
      of everybody's shirt, see,

16:50.242 --> 16:52.276
    right here on the pocket    
    they got the guy's nickname.

16:52.278 --> 16:54.711
     Oh, boy, them Cannonballers
     got some great nicknames,  

16:54.713 --> 16:57.281
    like for the tall guy,      
    you know, they got "Shorty."

16:57.283 --> 17:00.284
    And for the big, fat guy,   
    they got "Skinny" there.    

17:00.286 --> 17:01.484
        I ain't maked up my mind

17:01.486 --> 17:03.553
              what my nickname's
              gonna be yet.     

17:03.555 --> 17:05.255
I know a good one.              

17:05.257 --> 17:06.256
                    Yeah?       

17:06.258 --> 17:08.391
"Handsome."                     

17:17.568 --> 17:19.169
 Well, that wouldn't work out,  
        Edith, you see,         

17:19.171 --> 17:20.971
    because the name's          
     got to be the opposite     

17:20.973 --> 17:23.307
     than what the guy is.      

17:23.309 --> 17:26.476
Why don't you just use          
your initials? A.B.             

17:26.478 --> 17:29.246
 What kind of nickname is that? 

17:29.248 --> 17:31.315
Then they can                   
all call you "Abie".            

17:35.186 --> 17:37.454
You gotta admit, you'd be       
the only Abie on that team.

                    I'll get it.

17:52.338 --> 17:55.105
Yeah. Yeah, Doug, hold it.      

17:55.107 --> 17:56.306
 Just make it short and sweet.  

17:56.308 --> 17:58.408
         I want to know         
      about Charlie Green.      

17:58.410 --> 18:01.144
    What did he bowl?           

18:01.146 --> 18:02.980
             What?              

18:02.982 --> 18:04.882
        Say that again.         

18:04.884 --> 18:07.084
Oh, boy, thanks for telling me! 

18:07.086 --> 18:08.285
    Baby, I could kiss you!     

18:08.287 --> 18:11.121
He could kiss a guy,            
but he won't carry a purse.     

18:12.823 --> 18:14.758
 Oh, Doug, is that great news!  

18:14.760 --> 18:16.093

18:16.095 --> 18:18.295
    I'll talk to you later.     
Thanks a million for calling me.

         You beat Charlie Green.

18:24.836 --> 18:28.171
Charlie Green                   
only bowled 172.                

18:28.173 --> 18:29.773
Wait a second.                  
Wait a second.                  

18:29.775 --> 18:32.142
Didn't you tell me              
that you bowled 172?            

18:32.144 --> 18:33.911
                That's right.

Well, then you                  
and Charlie Green tied.

                That's right.   

18:36.748 --> 18:38.748
Well, how do you know           
they didn't pick Charlie Green? 

18:38.750 --> 18:41.985
  Because, as I told you before,
  which you forgot,             

18:41.987 --> 18:43.553
      it ain't only the bowling.

18:43.555 --> 18:45.055
              It's the guy, see?

18:45.057 --> 18:47.925
        Like where he's from,   
        who he is, what he is...

18:47.927 --> 18:49.993
Is it possible                  
that Charlie Green is Jewish?   

18:51.229 --> 18:52.529
             Even better for me,
             he's a spade.

 you don't want to play         
 with the bush leaguers no more.

          No. No, it ain't that.

20:01.433 --> 20:03.633
     But you'd do the same thing
     if you was a Cannonballer.

         of a lifetime.

You're jealous.                 

20:30.095 --> 20:31.928
            You're a jerk, Arch.

    that jealous guy there?

  He ain't going to be friends  
        with me no more.        

20:38.937 --> 20:40.737
What do I care?                 
I got plenty of friends.        

20:40.739 --> 20:41.938
And I got                       
new friends too.

some good for me.

for you too, Edith.

20:55.954 --> 20:58.621
Oh, Edith, wait till            
I tell you about this.          

20:58.623 --> 21:01.991
    The annual banquet, which   
    means once a year, see.     

21:01.993 --> 21:02.992
                    Oh...       

21:02.994 --> 21:04.294
          You know what they do?

21:04.296 --> 21:06.296
     They hire the American     
     Legion Hall out in Mineola,

21:06.298 --> 21:07.897
            which is beautiful  
            out there, you know?

21:07.899 --> 21:09.132
Oh, yeah.                       

21:09.134 --> 21:10.934
    And then they come around   
    right to your door,         

21:10.936 --> 21:12.602
            pick you up in      
            a big special bus   

21:12.604 --> 21:15.738
        to take you out there,  
        first-class all the way.

21:15.740 --> 21:16.806
            And then in the bus,

21:16.808 --> 21:19.176
                  they got a keg
                  of beer, see. 

21:19.178 --> 21:20.577
                And then to work
                up your thirst, 

21:20.579 --> 21:23.813
        they pass out them      
        big salty pretzels, see.

21:23.815 --> 21:25.148
                  And if that   
                  wasn't enough,

21:25.150 --> 21:26.383
                  when they get 
                  you out there,

21:26.385 --> 21:29.219
    they turn on a big feast    
    like you never seen before--

21:29.221 --> 21:31.188

21:31.190 --> 21:33.923
  you can shove into yourself.  

21:33.925 --> 21:36.526
    And when it's all over,     
I go up and get my trophy.

     you're gonna win one?      

21:38.897 --> 21:42.432

21:42.434 --> 21:45.368

        for high series.

22:31.383 --> 22:32.582
          we had to do it, Arch.

22:32.584 --> 22:34.518
I bowled                        
as high as Charlie Green.       

22:34.520 --> 22:35.718
             That's the problem.

22:35.720 --> 22:37.720
        If you'd have beat him, 
        we could have taken you,

22:37.722 --> 22:39.722
      but you didn't,           
      so we had to take Charlie.

22:39.724 --> 22:41.124
You took Charlie Green?         

22:41.126 --> 22:43.293
            He bowled as good   
            as you, Arch.       

22:43.295 --> 22:45.629
  And I'll say this for Charlie,
  he sure looks good in yellow. 

22:47.131 --> 22:49.866
Wait a minute,                  
I look good in yellow.          

22:49.868 --> 22:52.235
        I don't like this       
        any more than you do,   

22:52.237 --> 22:54.237
         but you can't fight it.
         The world's changing.  

22:54.239 --> 22:55.639
And every time it changes,      

22:55.641 --> 22:59.442
it gives me                     
another kick in the butt.       

22:59.444 --> 23:02.011
         I'm sorry, Arch,       
         but I'll tell you what.

23:02.013 --> 23:04.614
        If anyone else dies,    
        we'll call you first.   

23:10.087 --> 23:12.656
Archie, here's a sandwich.      

23:12.658 --> 23:15.225
                Aw, take it away
                again, Edith.   

23:15.227 --> 23:16.593
         I ain't hungry no more.

23:16.595 --> 23:19.028
But you said                    
you was hungry as a horse.      

23:19.030 --> 23:22.599
     That's when the horse      
was a different color, Ma.      

23:22.601 --> 23:23.633
         What happened?         

23:23.635 --> 23:26.369
         Charlie Green          
    is the new Cannonballer.    

23:26.371 --> 23:30.139
Oh, Archie,                     
you didn't make the team.       

23:30.141 --> 23:31.241
                         No.    

23:31.243 --> 23:32.909
Oh, I'm sorry.                  

23:32.911 --> 23:36.379
Well, maybe you'll get          
another chance.                 

23:36.381 --> 23:39.216
      Yeah, yeah, I will.       

23:39.218 --> 23:41.951
  Moose Hansen just told me...  

23:41.953 --> 23:44.454
  I'm next on the death list.   

23:52.863 --> 23:55.031
It's 8:00, Archie.              

23:55.033 --> 23:58.101
I thought you and Barney Hefner 
was going bowling.              

23:58.103 --> 23:59.336
        I thought so too, Edith,

23:59.338 --> 24:01.338
         but the bum calls me up
         at the last minute,    

24:01.340 --> 24:03.139
    tells me he's going         
    to the fights with McNab.   

24:03.141 --> 24:04.641
    Oh.                         

24:05.809 --> 24:08.578
Would you like me               
to go bowling with you?         

24:13.684 --> 24:16.219
  Stick to what you know, huh?  

24:19.290 --> 24:21.224
          What's that?          

24:23.561 --> 24:25.629
  You don't know neither, huh?  

24:41.612 --> 24:45.214
             [¶]
