macaroni and cheese?

24:08.014 --> 24:10.948
Um, I don't think
I have macaroni and cheese.

24:10.950 --> 24:14.084
I have crackers
and I have rice.
You want crackers?

24:16.122 --> 24:18.956
Carol, open the door.
It's me, Wendy.

24:18.958 --> 24:21.559
Uh, hold on a second,
Wendy.
Open the door, Carol.

24:21.561 --> 24:23.194
I have the police with me.

24:24.030 --> 24:26.530
Uh, hold on
a second please, Wendy.

24:26.532 --> 24:28.466
Let's go.
Hide the pepper spray.
I'm not gonna ask you again.

24:28.468 --> 24:30.968
Hold on a second, Wendy.
I'm coming, Wendy.

24:30.970 --> 24:32.870
Would you hold on
a second please?
Police! Open the door!

24:32.872 --> 24:35.539
I'm coming.
We have a warrant
for your arrest.

24:35.541 --> 24:37.708
For whose arrest?
Calm down.

24:37.710 --> 24:40.778
Wendy, for my arrest?
For what? What did I do?
Hands behind your back.

24:41.214 --> 24:43.681
You have warrant for her arrest?
Can I ask why?
Can I see it?

24:43.683 --> 24:45.616
Let me see it.
Right there.

24:45.618 --> 24:47.952
That is very tight.
Put your hands behind your back.

24:47.954 --> 24:49.787
Can you loosen that
a little bit please?

24:49.789 --> 24:51.822
Wendy, what's this about?
Carol, just stop resisting.

24:51.824 --> 24:53.791
I'm not resisting, Wendy!
What the hell?

24:53.793 --> 24:56.727
Stay put, kids,
Child Services is on the way.

24:56.729 --> 24:58.162
Why is Child Services--
Come on, Carol, let's go.

24:58.164 --> 24:59.730
Goldie, don't let Child Services
get them.

24:59.732 --> 25:01.532
Goldie, do you hear me?
You got her?

25:01.534 --> 25:03.501
Don't let--
Can I say goodbye to my kids?

25:03.503 --> 25:05.636
No, you cannot.
Can I talk to my daughter
please?

25:05.638 --> 25:07.571
Stay calm.
Goldie, don't let Child
Services-- I'm calm!

25:07.573 --> 25:10.674
Wendy, what the fuck?
Can I say goodbye
to my fucking kids?

25:10.676 --> 25:12.710
Mommy--
Let's go.

25:13.613 --> 25:15.880
Take her out. Stay here.

25:15.882 --> 25:18.082
It's too tight!
You don't have to
break her arm.

25:19.585 --> 25:23.220
Put your backpack on.
Sherrie, we're going
on a little trip.

25:23.222 --> 25:25.022
-Where are we going?
-Where's Mama?

25:26.592 --> 25:28.859
-Where did they take Mama?
-Sherrie, pack your clothes.

25:29.896 --> 25:32.997
Your toothbrushes, everything.
Get the inhaler, come on.

25:32.999 --> 25:34.598
Can we bring Mr. Bear?

25:34.600 --> 25:36.634
No, we can't bring Mr. Bear.
Come on!

25:36.636 --> 25:38.235
I don't have time for that!

25:38.237 --> 25:43.607
Let go of my arm,
and I'll say he's a real puss--
Pulling my hands tighter.

25:43.609 --> 25:45.142
Wendy! Wendy!

25:48.047 --> 25:50.214
-Just wait right here.- Don't leave us!

26:35.127 --> 26:37.127
You okay?
Look for her inhaler.

26:38.097 --> 26:40.064
Look in every pocket.
Look in every single one.

26:40.066 --> 26:42.099
-Open all these shits.
-Okay.

26:43.869 --> 26:45.169
I'm sorry.

26:46.372 --> 26:48.172
I don't have the inhaler.
It's not here.

26:48.808 --> 26:50.808
Check these other bags.
Check this one.

26:52.745 --> 26:54.078
Supreme, I told you to pack it.

26:54.080 --> 26:56.213
I'm sorry, I didn't--

26:56.215 --> 26:58.382
Bruh, this is why--
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry, Sherrie.

26:58.384 --> 27:01.619
Shit!
It's right behind you.
Just give me a fucking inhaler!

27:01.621 --> 27:03.253
I'm sorry, I cannot
help you.
Just give me an inhaler!

27:03.255 --> 27:04.688
Give me the fucking--
I cannot help you.

27:04.690 --> 27:06.056
I'm not allowed. I'm sorry.

27:06.058 --> 27:07.825
What are you doing?

27:07.827 --> 27:10.060
You can't come in here. Hey!

27:32.318 --> 27:34.985
Deep breath, deep breath.

27:41.994 --> 27:44.762
Promise you'll never
leave us alone.

27:45.765 --> 27:46.930
I promise.

27:51.437 --> 27:54.405
<i> This is Bronx Park East.</i>

28:08.721 --> 28:10.220
Janet!

28:10.790 --> 28:12.956
Janet home?
Yeah.

28:27.740 --> 28:29.173
Janet!

28:30.376 --> 28:33.243
Goldie.

28:41.754 --> 28:44.254
The cops took Mom.
I know.

28:44.924 --> 28:47.925
The shelter called.
Everybody's been
looking for you and the girls.

28:48.327 --> 28:49.426
What'd you say?

28:49.428 --> 28:51.295
What you think I said?

28:55.768 --> 28:58.235
Can I get
the girls some pizza?

28:58.237 --> 29:00.771
Uh, yeah sweetheart,
it's in the fridge.

29:08.013 --> 29:10.114
Child Services can help.

29:10.850 --> 29:13.383
Hell no.
They just gonna separate us.

29:13.385 --> 29:15.419
They can put Supreme
in Brooklyn,

29:15.421 --> 29:17.755
Sherrie with some white folks
in Queens.

29:18.791 --> 29:20.491
That ain't gonna happen.

29:20.493 --> 29:22.860
Well what's your plan?

29:23.329 --> 29:25.863
-We just need a place to stay.
-And then what?

29:27.900 --> 29:29.399
-Figure shit out.
-Like what?

29:29.401 --> 29:31.368
-A home.
-Okay.

29:31.370 --> 29:33.403
You don't need
to raise your voice at me,
all right?

29:33.973 --> 29:37.207
I'm asking what is it
that you're trying
to figure out?

29:39.178 --> 29:41.078
You ain't my teacher anymore.

29:41.881 --> 29:45.449
You're right.
I'm not your teacher anymore,
but I'm trying to help you.

29:45.451 --> 29:49.186
Then help.
I don't want you
and your sisters split up...

29:49.188 --> 29:53.090
any more than you do,
believe me,
but you need real help.

29:53.092 --> 29:55.893
You need a stable home.

29:55.895 --> 29:57.561
You need structure.

29:58.430 --> 30:01.465
You need an adult
in your life.
I'm grown.

30:02.067 --> 30:04.134
You just turned 18.

30:05.504 --> 30:09.506
I know you're a strong girl
but what are you gonna do?
Huh?

30:10.409 --> 30:13.544
How are you gonna
support yourself,
let alone your sisters?

30:13.546 --> 30:15.012
I'll figure it out.

30:15.014 --> 30:19.016
By working part time?
At Cookie's?

30:21.287 --> 30:23.353
Do you know what it takes
to support a family?

30:24.323 --> 30:27.891
Do you know how much
rent is in this city?

30:27.893 --> 30:31.895
Even in a shitty apartment,
even in a shitty neighborhood.

30:32.464 --> 30:37.568
And the references you'll need,
and first and last
and security deposit,

30:37.570 --> 30:41.004
money for food,
money for the bus,
for the subway.

30:43.509 --> 30:47.911
Sherrie! Preme! Come on.
Let's go.

30:49.315 --> 30:51.615
Let's go!

30:51.617 --> 30:53.483
Where are we going?
Come on!

30:58.424 --> 31:01.258
Goldie, wait!

31:01.260 --> 31:05.429
I can help you, and I want to,
but you gotta do this my way.

31:05.431 --> 31:07.898
Let's call Child Services.

31:07.900 --> 31:10.033
I can make sure
that the girls are placed
somewhere close by.

31:10.035 --> 31:11.969
I can make that happen.

31:19.011 --> 31:20.277
<i> Eli!</i>

31:20.279 --> 31:24.314
Eli! Eli! Eli!

31:25.384 --> 31:28.185
Ms. Turner!
Eli!

31:30.890 --> 31:34.191
Hey, Ms. Turner.
Hey, Goldie!

31:34.193 --> 31:36.326
How you doing, girl?
I'm all right.

31:36.595 --> 31:39.196
Who's this?
The pretty little princesses.

31:39.632 --> 31:41.198
Hi.
My little sisters.

31:41.200 --> 31:43.233
Aww. How you doing?

31:43.235 --> 31:44.468
Good.
You hungry?

31:44.470 --> 31:46.270
Yes.
Well, have a seat.

31:46.272 --> 31:47.971
Thank you.
Yeah.

31:47.973 --> 31:51.275
He's in there in the back.
You all right?

31:53.612 --> 31:56.546
Hey, queen. What's up?
Hey.

32:00.319 --> 32:02.352
What's going on, Goldie?

32:11.096 --> 32:12.396
What's wrong?

32:14.633 --> 32:17.701
My moms got locked up.
You say what?

32:17.703 --> 32:19.670
My moms got locked up.

32:20.439 --> 32:24.141
Oh, that's fucked up.
What happened?

32:24.510 --> 32:26.510
They just took her, bro.

32:26.512 --> 32:29.346
They came in and Sherrie
and Supreme was there
and everything.

32:31.717 --> 32:33.383
Is it serious?

32:34.420 --> 32:36.186
Yeah, bro.

32:36.188 --> 32:40.023
It's a felony.
She gonna be locked up
for a minute.

32:40.025 --> 32:43.393
Oh. Damn.

32:43.395 --> 32:47.197
Yeah. Child Services
is looking for us.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.466
Where are the girls?

32:50.536 --> 32:52.736
They're here.
They here?

32:53.639 --> 32:55.339
Where else would they be?

32:57.710 --> 32:59.743
What y'all going to do?

33:04.550 --> 33:07.017
You think we could stay here
for a few days?

33:14.193 --> 33:16.593
Can we stay with you?
Just for a few days?

33:16.595 --> 33:19.029
I mean,
you know I don't care,

33:19.031 --> 33:22.499
but I gotta ask Grandma first,
see if we got some space.

33:32.244 --> 33:34.011
Come on, man.

33:37.383 --> 33:39.282
I gotta make this video.

33:40.686 --> 33:43.653
I just got in.
I gotta kill this shit.
I can't fuck it up.

33:43.655 --> 33:45.222
You gonna kill it.

33:50.763 --> 33:52.629
Look.
What's that?

33:53.465 --> 33:57.334
Mom's prescriptions.
Oh, shit. You got 'em?

33:58.637 --> 34:00.370
Let me see what you got.

34:01.807 --> 34:05.075
You got about--
150 pills.

34:05.477 --> 34:08.512
That'll work, man.
What you gonna do with it?

34:10.282 --> 34:13.350
I'm gonna sell it.
And you're gonna help me.

34:14.420 --> 34:17.521
You know
I don't mess with this.
What?

34:17.523 --> 34:20.590
Man, I just got out.
I ain't trying to go back.

34:20.592 --> 34:23.659
They're just percs.
It's still jail time, though.

34:25.831 --> 34:27.664
You gonna come with me?

35:09.641 --> 35:11.308
<i> Princess.</i>

35:11.810 --> 35:13.477
Yo, wait up!

35:14.513 --> 35:16.780
Hey! Wait up.

35:27.392 --> 35:28.892
This Princess' house?

35:34.633 --> 35:36.633
Hey, man, what's up?

35:36.635 --> 35:39.236
Looking for trouble again?

35:39.238 --> 35:41.371
Only if you are, baby.
Hi, Princess.

35:41.807 --> 35:43.573
What do you want?

35:43.909 --> 35:45.609
I got something
I know you want.

35:45.611 --> 35:47.611
You got something
you know I want?

35:47.613 --> 35:49.646
Bitch, stop your shit.

35:50.449 --> 35:52.682
Oh

35:52.684 --> 35:54.184
Get on with it.

36:00.792 --> 36:03.426
What's up, Princess?
Y'all chillin'?

36:03.428 --> 36:05.762
-Three hundred.
-Four fifty.

36:05.764 --> 36:07.731
Three hundred.

36:07.733 --> 36:10.167
-Four hundred.
-I said $300.

36:10.169 --> 36:11.768
Three fifty, and that's
the lowest I'm gonna go.

36:11.770 --> 36:13.503
You know me better than that,
Princess.
I said--

36:13.505 --> 36:15.672
-I know you-- $300, bitch.
-Go get your man!

36:15.674 --> 36:17.674
Don't tell me,
"Get your man."
Go get my coin.

36:17.676 --> 36:19.843
Three fifty,
go get that shit.
Three--

36:23.415 --> 36:24.881
Yo, Ricky.

36:43.335 --> 36:46.770
Maybe you should get
yourself something nice to wear.

36:48.874 --> 36:51.274
And give me my drugs. Uh!

36:52.945 --> 36:55.312
Really?
This bitch go.

37:54.806 --> 37:56.473
Eli, come on, let's go.

37:56.475 --> 37:58.608
Ooh, where you off to,
Ms. Goldie?

37:58.610 --> 38:00.610
I got shit to do.
What shit you
gotta do?

38:00.612 --> 38:04.281
I got a music video.
You got a music video?
Bitch!

38:04.283 --> 38:07.350
Don't nobody want
your bald-headed ass
in no music video.

38:07.352 --> 38:08.985
Yeah, get the hell out,
okay, you smokin'--

38:11.290 --> 38:13.323
Wait up. Hey!

38:15.794 --> 38:17.827
Yo, fuck them
bitch-ass simple--
Hey, don't worry about it, man.

38:17.829 --> 38:19.929
She ain't got nothing on you.

38:21.433 --> 38:22.832
Chill out, man.

38:26.838 --> 38:30.740
Goldie.
What are we here for?

38:32.511 --> 38:34.744
Goldie.
Goldie, what are you doing?

38:35.580 --> 38:36.880
Come on,
you don't even need that coat.

38:36.882 --> 38:39.049
Man, get you a room tonight.
Goldie!

38:41.586 --> 38:44.020
Goldie! Can you come on?

38:51.763 --> 38:53.663
<i> Frank!</i>
Give me my money!

38:53.665 --> 38:54.764
Got nothing for you.

38:54.766 --> 38:56.599
I know you have it.

38:56.601 --> 38:58.335
I worked for that money,
that's two weeks of work.

38:58.337 --> 39:00.003
I don't got your money.
Even if I did,

39:00.005 --> 39:01.805
you think I'd just
give it to you?

39:01.807 --> 39:04.441
All that time you took,
took, took from my mom.

39:04.443 --> 39:06.443
Not doing shit all day,
not helping.

39:06.445 --> 39:07.577
You ain't work for that shit.

39:07.579 --> 39:09.045
I worked for that money.

39:09.047 --> 39:10.947
You take a cut for ten,
and my mama go to jail?

39:10.949 --> 39:12.982
-Y'all gotta calm down.
-I am calm.

39:12.984 --> 39:14.884
I am too,
but she got my money, B.

39:14.886 --> 39:17.754
That true, Goldie?
Man, like I told y'all before,

39:17.756 --> 39:19.889
I don't have it.
I promise.

39:22.794 --> 39:24.361
Are you sure?

39:24.363 --> 39:26.129
Man, you trying
to pin shit on me too.

39:26.131 --> 39:27.797
He got my mom
locked up.

39:27.799 --> 39:29.933
It wasn't me.
I love your mother.

39:29.935 --> 39:32.135
Who else did it then?

39:32.137 --> 39:33.803
I swear to God, Goldie.
I don't know.

39:33.805 --> 39:35.605
Maybe it was
one of the neighbors.

39:35.607 --> 39:37.741
I mean, you know Carol's not
the quietest person,

39:37.743 --> 39:40.443
-you know what I mean?
-Yeah, maybe.

39:40.445 --> 39:43.480
Come on, Goldie.
You know your mother.

39:44.950 --> 39:46.583
I promise.

39:50.422 --> 39:52.622
I know you wanna get this coin.

39:53.525 --> 39:55.024
That's Carol's?

39:55.026 --> 39:56.659
Don't worry about it.

39:57.062 --> 40:01.097
You help me sell it,
it goes well,
we can split it.

40:03.068 --> 40:04.868
All right.

40:04.870 --> 40:07.604
No doubt. I got you.

40:07.906 --> 40:10.106
Yeah.
I gotta go soon.

40:11.743 --> 40:13.810
Don't spoil the party, Eli.

40:13.812 --> 40:16.446
I left the water running.

40:17.916 --> 40:19.649
The fuck is that
supposed to mean?

40:20.152 --> 40:22.051
You been acting
real strange lately.

40:22.954 --> 40:25.955
Yo, come out.
We just getting friendly here.

40:26.591 --> 40:28.925
I like hanging out
with you guys, you know.

40:30.061 --> 40:31.828
It feels like
real quality time.

40:31.830 --> 40:34.531
You know when they say,
like, quality time?

40:35.000 --> 40:39.002
This is it, right here.
Quality time, boom.

40:39.805 --> 40:41.971
I like minding my own pizza.

40:45.177 --> 40:47.010
I like sharing a pizza.

40:50.515 --> 40:51.781
It's in here.

40:54.152 --> 40:55.552
I'm not going in there.

40:56.922 --> 40:58.688
You just gonna
leave me like that, Eli?

40:59.491 --> 41:02.592
Goldie, you know I love you.
I'm on papers, I can't.

41:06.531 --> 41:07.964
Eli!

41:11.002 --> 41:13.603
Come on in.

41:21.847 --> 41:23.546
Come on.

41:33.492 --> 41:35.158
Come on, just one more.

41:35.160 --> 41:36.759
What you waiting for?

41:49.241 --> 41:50.974
Come on.

42:00.819 --> 42:03.820
Come on, just one more.
What you waiting for?

42:13.265 --> 42:14.664
Come on.

42:21.806 --> 42:23.139
Come on.

42:34.853 --> 42:36.786
We have to wait here.

43:04.015 --> 43:06.649
I want you to know
I really love your mother.

43:06.651 --> 43:08.151
I hope she's okay.

43:15.026 --> 43:17.327
Every time I see
the two of you together,

43:17.329 --> 43:19.762
I really miss
having a mother.

43:26.037 --> 43:29.038
She feels really embarrassed
that she lost the house
and everything.

43:29.741 --> 43:32.742
She feels very ashamed,
you know.

43:34.312 --> 43:35.845
I know.

43:35.847 --> 43:40.083
She really tried to provide
the best she could for you,
you know.

43:41.252 --> 43:42.385
I know.

43:42.387 --> 43:46.856
Oh God, Goldie, I swear,
I hope they let her out.

43:46.858 --> 43:48.391
I swear, because--
Not even just for me,

43:48.393 --> 43:50.293
because I miss her so much,
but...

43:50.295 --> 43:53.363
but for you mostly
and for the sisters.

43:54.099 --> 43:56.833
I hope they let her out,
I swear to God.

44:00.238 --> 44:02.872
My bad for macing you earlier.

44:04.376 --> 44:07.076
It's okay.
Don't worry about it.

44:07.078 --> 44:09.012
Frank can stand the pain.

44:11.683 --> 44:14.884
What the fuck
is taking so long?
Where these niggas at?

44:15.720 --> 44:17.086
Oh.

44:27.999 --> 44:31.267
Mmm-hmm. Oh, okay.

44:34.005 --> 44:37.240
Um... they wanna
meet me alone.

44:37.976 --> 44:42.011
So give it to me,
and then I'll come back here.

44:44.382 --> 44:45.948
Give it to you?

44:46.718 --> 44:48.685
Yeah.

44:50.455 --> 44:53.389
You hilarious.
I never met a nigga
like you before.

44:53.391 --> 44:55.358
I don't know
what you're talking about.

44:55.360 --> 44:57.126
You trying to play me.

44:57.128 --> 44:58.828
I-I'm not playing with you.

44:59.064 --> 45:00.430
Goldie, I--

45:00.432 --> 45:02.298
Leave me the fuck alone.

45:02.300 --> 45:05.101
I-I told you,
I'd split it with you.
Goldie.

45:05.470 --> 45:08.271
Come back, Goldie! Goldie!

45:08.273 --> 45:10.373
What else you gonna do?

45:10.375 --> 45:12.742
Goldie! Goldie!

45:16.247 --> 45:19.282
Goldie. What else you gonna do?

45:29.260 --> 45:30.893
<i> What else you gonna do?</i>

45:32.263 --> 45:34.297
<i>Can we play on the stoop, there?</i>

45:38.870 --> 45:41.938
Yo, Eli! Eli!

45:46.377 --> 45:47.910

45:55.487 --> 45:58.488
Yo, fuck out of here!

46:02.260 --> 46:03.760
Eli!

46:05.797 --> 46:07.130
Eli!

46:10.235 --> 46:12.869
What's up, Goldie?
Let me in.

46:13.238 --> 46:15.538
I can't do that.
Why?

46:16.107 --> 46:19.208
My grandma said no.
You told her?

46:19.210 --> 46:22.278
I had to.
I can't lie to my grandma.

46:23.848 --> 46:26.916
What about my sisters?
They in there sleeping.

46:27.519 --> 46:29.485
Come back and get them tomorrow
in the morning.

46:30.021 --> 46:32.121
I mean, you gotta go.
My grandma gonna call the cops.

46:32.123 --> 46:34.090
She is not playing at all.

46:36.294 --> 46:37.493
I'm sorry.

46:43.835 --> 46:45.168
<i> José!</i>

47:27.612 --> 47:30.279
<i> Stop.</i>

47:31.182 --> 47:35.218
<i> Stop! Ow, shit!</i>

47:36.254 --> 47:38.621
<i> Ah! Fuck! </i>

47:41.059 --> 47:44.460
<i> It hurts. Ow!</i>

47:45.029 --> 47:47.930
Wait, let me--
Let me roll it up.

47:53.371 --> 47:55.504
I can't even get a--

47:56.541 --> 47:58.241
Yo, what's up?

47:59.110 --> 48:00.877
Gotta get rid of these.

48:00.879 --> 48:03.045
What is this?
Percs.

48:04.115 --> 48:05.481
Where you get this from?

48:05.483 --> 48:08.050
Same place.
Same place?

48:08.419 --> 48:10.419
You sure she ain't out here
looking for your ass?

48:13.958 --> 48:15.258
She got locked up.

48:16.060 --> 48:17.560
The fuck!

48:19.197 --> 48:21.664
Did they follow you here,
man?
No.

48:21.666 --> 48:23.399
You sure?
How much?

48:24.235 --> 48:25.434
What's the rush, man?

48:25.436 --> 48:28.037
I need the money.
For what?

48:28.039 --> 48:30.573
A coat.
A coat?

48:31.910 --> 48:34.310
Yeah.
A coat for what?

48:34.979 --> 48:37.213
I got big plans.

48:37.215 --> 48:40.149
If I do this shit right,
me and my sisters
will make it out.

48:40.151 --> 48:41.584
Mm.

48:44.122 --> 48:45.655
You know what,
that's what's up, huh.

48:45.657 --> 48:48.257
Yeah, that's what's up.
And the universe is with me.

48:48.259 --> 48:50.626
Universe is definitely
with you.

48:50.628 --> 48:53.329
All with you,
because that's what
you deserve and more.

48:53.331 --> 48:55.932
But you know what,
have a seat, man.
Sit down.

49:00.939 --> 49:02.505
Well sit down, man.
Come on, baby.

49:02.507 --> 49:04.607
Stop acting like that, huh.

49:10.515 --> 49:12.415
Relax, man.
I got you, man.

49:12.417 --> 49:14.951
That's what friends
is for, man, right?

49:29.667 --> 49:31.200
Why you up?

49:32.103 --> 49:33.502
I gotta go.

49:38.142 --> 49:41.243
Give me my money. You said
you were gonna give it to me
in the morning.

49:41.245 --> 49:43.446
 Later.

49:45.650 --> 49:47.516
Come on!

49:51.990 --> 49:53.306
I said later, man.

49:53.307 --> 49:54.623
At least give me a ride
to the city, my nigga.
What the fuck?

49:57.628 --> 49:59.662
There's some pizza
in the refrigerator.

51:12.804 --> 51:15.271
Where were you?
Where did you go?

51:15.273 --> 51:17.239
Goldie, I missed you.

51:17.241 --> 51:18.574
Missed y'all, too.

51:18.576 --> 51:20.109
Goldie.

51:20.511 --> 51:22.578
You got me in some shit
this time, man.

51:23.347 --> 51:26.282
I had to convince Grandma
don't call the cops on you
last night.

51:26.484 --> 51:28.717
My bad, bro.
Your bad?

51:29.187 --> 51:30.853
So what's next?
We sell the rest?

51:30.855 --> 51:32.655
Nah, José got me for it.

51:32.657 --> 51:34.824
He got you?
Yeah.

51:35.660 --> 51:37.726
You need to get you
a room tonight, man.

51:37.728 --> 51:39.862
Can't.
Why not?

51:39.864 --> 51:41.297
You know why.

51:43.801 --> 51:46.135
We might have to
call Child Services.

51:48.806 --> 51:50.439
I don't know how
to help you.

51:50.441 --> 51:52.141
All right. Bet.

51:52.143 --> 51:54.110
Don't be like that.

51:54.112 --> 51:56.745

54:01.405 --> 54:03.806
Yeah, he has a PlayStation.

54:03.808 --> 54:05.708
I'm hungry.

54:07.378 --> 54:09.245
Wanna go get some pizza?
Come on, we're in a rush.

54:09.247 --> 54:12.014
I don't want pizza.
I want bacon.

54:12.016 --> 54:16.585
You want bacon.
All right, I'll get you bacon
next time.

Hi.

55:20.318 --> 55:21.784
You wanna come in?

55:23.587 --> 55:25.387
Gotta get the girls, first.

55:26.390 --> 55:28.390
Girls are here?

56:00.091 --> 56:02.558
So you don't think
they're gonna let her out

56:03.694 --> 56:05.494
No, not this time.

56:12.570 --> 56:14.036
What you gonna do?

56:16.807 --> 56:18.440
Got a video tomorrow.

56:18.743 --> 56:20.075
Just need a place

56:21.011 --> 56:22.111

What, you sing?

56:28.853 --> 56:30.853
Nah, I dance.

56:31.555 --> 56:34.022
You dance?

56:35.559 --> 56:37.793
Like what I used to do with you
when you was little?

56:39.597 --> 56:41.430
A little better than that.

56:42.533 --> 56:44.833
Yeah? All right.

56:44.835 --> 56:46.068
Gimme five.

Hi.

57:13.097 --> 57:14.830
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

57:56.740 --> 57:58.674
What'd you say
the plan was again?

57:59.510 --> 58:01.210
Why you keep
asking me that?

58:01.212 --> 58:02.778
Well, what you gonna do?

58:03.848 --> 58:07.115
My career's about to take off.
I'm gonna get us a home.

58:07.117 --> 58:09.051
Oh, Goldie.

58:14.091 --> 58:15.891
You gotta call Child Services.

58:16.760 --> 58:18.193
They gonna separate us.

58:18.195 --> 58:20.963
You can't handle this.
I can.

58:22.533 --> 58:24.566
Just need a little help.

58:25.903 --> 58:27.102
Look at me.

58:29.240 --> 58:31.206
You can't stay here.

58:36.547 --> 58:38.614
Look...

Please take it!

58:54.031 --> 58:55.597
Doesn't he love us?

58:57.034 --> 58:59.835
Nobody loves us.
Why doesn't he love us?

58:59.837 --> 59:01.770
Because that's how it is.

59:05.209 --> 59:06.642
I didn't mean that.

59:07.044 --> 59:08.777
I didn't mean it.
I'm sorry.

59:08.779 --> 59:10.779
She didn't mean it, Sherrie.

59:11.982 --> 59:13.549
I didn't mean it.

01:20:18.181 --> 01:20:20.181
It's the right thing to do,
Goldie.

01:20:22.919 --> 01:20:24.518
I gotta make the call.

01:20:25.321 --> 01:20:26.921
I can't make this work.

01:20:27.924 --> 01:20:29.924
I know.

01:20:31.894 --> 01:20:33.994
I miss her so much.

01:20:36.432 --> 01:20:38.566
I know.

01:20:38.568 --> 01:20:42.570
Look, we'll try to make it
so that they can
stay together.

01:20:42.572 --> 01:20:44.471
Okay?

01:20:44.473 --> 01:20:46.373
And you can stay with me.

01:20:47.610 --> 01:20:49.944
I'll clear out
the computer room.

01:21:04.193 --> 01:21:06.927
Preme. Wake up.

01:21:08.064 --> 01:21:09.597
Get your shoes.

01:21:14.136 --> 01:21:15.636
Sherrie.

01:21:19.375 --> 01:21:24.278
What? What, what?
How-how--

01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:25.946
How did you find him?

01:21:26.582 --> 01:21:29.116
It doesn't matter.
Just give him a hug.

01:21:36.993 --> 01:21:38.492
Come on, girls.

01:21:39.428 --> 01:21:41.595
There's someone
waiting for us outside.

01:21:53.009 --> 01:21:54.441
Hey, girls.

01:21:55.177 --> 01:21:57.912
Hi.
Supreme.

01:21:57.914 --> 01:21:59.914
Nice to meet you.

01:22:00.082 --> 01:22:02.016
She's gonna
take you guys
to a nice home.

01:22:02.018 --> 01:22:03.550
Mm!
Okay, okay.

01:22:03.552 --> 01:22:05.619
All right, sweetheart.
I don't wanna go.

01:22:05.621 --> 01:22:07.187
And I'll come see
you guys tomorrow.

01:22:07.189 --> 01:22:08.689
I know, sweetie.

01:22:08.691 --> 01:22:10.691
Come on, girls.

01:22:10.693 --> 01:22:13.027
But Goldie, you promised.

01:22:13.029 --> 01:22:15.930
I'm so sorry.
I'll wait for you inside,
Goldie.

01:22:23.072 --> 01:22:25.272
Sherrie! Sherrie!

01:22:27.410 --> 01:22:30.644
It's only for a little bit.

01:22:40.189 --> 01:22:42.256
I'm gonna
come see you guys tomorrow.

01:22:42.258 --> 01:22:46.994
Mm-mm! No.
I don't wanna go.
Stop! No.

01:22:47.630 --> 01:22:49.997
Sherrie. Sherrie!

01:22:57.206 --> 01:22:58.706
Mm-mm.

01:23:01.677 --> 01:23:03.644
Sherrie!

01:23:05.581 --> 01:23:09.016
No.
How about
I put him in the front?

01:23:10.386 --> 01:23:11.986
Okay?

01:23:39.648 --> 01:23:41.615
Don't forget your seatbelts.

01:24:02.304 --> 01:24:04.038
Goldie, please!

01:24:06.308 --> 01:24:07.775
Goldie!
