snow for Christmas...

You saw it.

Yeah, but I didn't actually
see it.

01:53.114 --> 01:55.514
You seem a little more stressed
than usual.

01:55.549 --> 01:57.082
I bought a hotel over the
weekend.

01:57.151 --> 01:58.717
It was Thanksgiving.

01:58.786 --> 02:01.320
I made the deal anyway,
it was too good to pass up.

02:01.355 --> 02:03.255
It does come with a few strings.

02:03.324 --> 02:05.090
Okay, what are the strings?

02:05.126 --> 02:06.436
They were in the middle

They went bankrupt.
We have to finish the job.

I have two weeks left
on Pine Ridge and then...

02:11.632 --> 02:13.966
I didn't tell you the biggest
string.

02:14.034 --> 02:16.935
The job has to be done
by Christmas Eve.

02:16.971 --> 02:18.670
All right, that's in four weeks.

02:18.739 --> 02:20.706
What kind of work
are we looking at?

02:20.741 --> 02:21.741
About eight weeks' worth.

02:23.677 --> 02:24.677

02:26.580 --> 02:29.381

Yes, um...

02:37.091 --> 02:38.390
That is the Enchanted Lodge.

you're from, isn't it?

02:45.032 --> 02:46.331
I can't do this.

02:46.367 --> 02:48.267
Of course you can. Why not?

02:48.302 --> 02:50.602
Because it is Christmas...

02:50.638 --> 02:52.971
and I cannot leave my daughter
on Christmas.

02:53.007 --> 02:54.885
You don't have to leave your

this time of year.

03:03.851 --> 03:05.691
Honestly, this just looks
like it's way more...

03:16.530 --> 03:18.664

03:36.750 --> 03:38.450

03:38.485 --> 03:40.085
Of course you can.

03:40.120 --> 03:43.355

This about your dad?

03:48.362 --> 03:51.563
No! It's... it's a little bit
about my dad.

03:51.599 --> 03:54.266

But you can't dance.

04:29.970 --> 04:31.436
Okay, how would you know?

04:31.472 --> 04:34.139
We were at that place for our
second or third date...

and then I asked you to dance
and you said, "I can't dance."

04:37.211 --> 04:40.545
No, I said, "I don't dance."
There's a big difference.

What else I got?

09:53.226 --> 09:56.595

Christmas CD ever made.

Ever in the history...

09:58.498 --> 09:59.864

09:59.900 --> 10:01.277
All right, well, then we
shouldn't have a hard time...

10:01.301 --> 10:02.701
finding something that works
better.

10:04.771 --> 10:06.504
Taylor, have I told you how
thankful I am...

10:06.540 --> 10:07.339
that you're doing this show
with me?

10:07.407 --> 10:09.441
Ricardo, it's not a big deal.

10:09.476 --> 10:10.720
The tour ended and I really
didn't have anything else...

10:10.744 --> 10:11.977
to do for Christmas, so...

10:12.012 --> 10:14.312
This is what Christmas
is all about.

10:14.381 --> 10:15.992
The fact that they asked me
to come back...

10:16.016 --> 10:17.582
it just means so much.

10:17.651 --> 10:19.329
I mean, my Aunt Claudia
is actually producing...

10:19.353 --> 10:20.530
the whole thing, so I kind
of had an in...

10:20.554 --> 10:23.421
but hey, I'll take it.

10:23.490 --> 10:26.091
So, it feels good to be home
then, right?

10:27.694 --> 10:29.694
Yeah.

10:31.198 --> 10:32.631
Yeah, I guess.

10:32.666 --> 10:35.000
I'm sorry. Um, uh, you know,
I actually...

10:35.035 --> 10:37.135
I don't make it back home
that often.

10:37.170 --> 10:38.803
I guess I've just become
accustomed...

10:38.839 --> 10:40.319
to whatever hotel I'm in,
that's home.

10:41.742 --> 10:42.841
Hmmm.

10:42.876 --> 10:44.109
But there must be something...

10:44.144 --> 10:45.977
that made you want to come back,
right?

11:30.057 --> 11:31.956
I'm sorry I'm so late.

11:31.992 --> 11:33.992
I had to meet with the choir
director and then...

11:34.061 --> 11:36.428
I had to meet with the guy who's
doing the programs...

11:36.496 --> 11:38.863
and chase down the permission
slips.

11:38.899 --> 11:43.034

Oh, I forgot the antlers!

Yes, and everybody is saying
you're doing a great job. So...

11:57.117 --> 12:00.151
Yeah, except for the fact that
I forgot to pick up...

12:00.187 --> 12:03.655
the antlers for the kids' show.

12:03.690 --> 12:04.734
I'm sure that they're going
to be...

12:04.758 --> 12:06.591
in the exact same place
tomorrow.

12:06.660 --> 12:09.427
Tomorrow we have to go to the
hotel and see the ballroom...

12:09.463 --> 12:11.930
which is a whole other mess.

12:11.998 --> 12:13.832
Yeah, I heard somebody bought
the place.

12:13.867 --> 12:15.834
Yeah, some company out of L.A.

12:15.902 --> 12:17.914
They swear they're going to have
everything ready...

12:17.938 --> 12:19.671
by Christmas Eve, but I don't
know.

12:19.706 --> 12:21.139
I don't know.

12:21.174 --> 12:22.952
You're probably going to have
to get a backup location.

12:22.976 --> 12:24.075

It's a good cause.

12:34.287 --> 12:37.555
We're doing this for a good
cause. Okay.

12:37.591 --> 12:40.158
Here are the permission slips
from the parents...

12:40.227 --> 12:42.494
so you can start rehearsals
with the kids.

Got it! Sweet. Thank you.

12:47.601 --> 12:49.801
Oh, ah, one thing.

12:49.836 --> 12:51.414
These kids, they're pretty good
at ballet, right?

12:51.438 --> 12:54.205
Because my routine...
it's really hard.

12:54.241 --> 12:58.243
What? No!

12:58.278 --> 13:01.479
Most of these kids have never
danced before in their lives!

It's a joke, Aunt Claudia.
I'm joking. Come here.

13:05.418 --> 13:07.051
Oh, you're doing amazing, okay?

13:07.087 --> 13:10.688
It's going to be kids doing easy
steps with reindeer costumes.

No, it was what it was.

If he hadn't have left...

14:19.526 --> 14:21.370
I wouldn't have met Daniel

You?

18:40.620 --> 18:43.020

back on tour in January.

call.

18:55.435 --> 18:57.502
I'm gonna... I'm gonna go talk
to Claudia, and...

18:57.537 --> 18:59.237
you'll be around though, right?

18:59.272 --> 19:01.172
I will be here.
Cool.

19:01.207 --> 19:04.041
Okay, well, I'll see you...
I'll see you around. Okay.

a show in the hotel...

19:10.150 --> 19:11.782
that you're in charge of?

19:11.818 --> 19:15.186
It's like fate. It's like
kismet. It's... like...

19:15.221 --> 19:17.889
It's like I'm dating someone.

19:17.924 --> 19:21.359
You are?
Yes... Scott.

19:21.394 --> 19:23.961
And why didn't I know
about this?

19:23.997 --> 19:26.664
Because it's new.

19:26.699 --> 19:28.833
Besides, you should have seen
Ricardo's dance partner.

19:28.868 --> 19:30.768
Oh, are they dating or just
dancing?

19:30.803 --> 19:32.336
I don't know, probably both.

19:32.372 --> 19:34.372
Well, you need to find out.

19:34.440 --> 19:36.374
Why? It's none of my business.

19:36.409 --> 19:39.043
What if the two of you start
remembering the good old days?

19:39.078 --> 19:42.280
Uh, we won't, he left.
Oh, my gosh!

19:42.315 --> 19:45.183

was a bad idea.

19:47.854 --> 19:50.221
What?

19:50.256 --> 19:52.123
Oh, there's nothing to do.

19:52.158 --> 19:56.394
We were whatever we were and...
it was a long time ago.

19:56.429 --> 20:00.398
We can't get back together.
We can't.

20:04.237 --> 20:05.269
Luminarias.

20:10.543 --> 20:14.879
Then we take a candle like so.
We have luminarias.

20:14.914 --> 20:16.347
Pretty.

20:16.382 --> 20:19.817
We'll put them along the pathway
in front of the house, okay?

your schoolwork today?

20:46.579 --> 20:47.590
I told Grandpa some of the
things...

20:47.614 --> 20:48.579
I put on my list for Santa.

20:48.615 --> 20:50.748

And guess what?

20:50.783 --> 20:56.754

you take these inside, yes?

20:56.789 --> 20:58.389

behind in her schoolwork, okay?

school at the lodge?

together.

you want to keep an eye on me?

something at me.

Now, in this problem...

28:21.534 --> 28:22.534
Why did she stop?

was more important.

there, it's getting there.

31:24.917 --> 31:26.650
How do you feel? Good?
Yeah!

31:26.685 --> 31:30.354
It's gonna look great!
All right, guys, good job.

31:30.389 --> 31:33.657
You guys are looking great.
Hey, go take five.

31:33.692 --> 31:34.836
Meet your parents over there...

31:34.860 --> 31:35.937
and I'll see you guys
in a minute, okay?

31:35.961 --> 31:36.961
Okay.

31:38.731 --> 31:42.432
This was our favorite spot.
May I sit?

31:42.468 --> 31:44.101
Yeah.

31:47.506 --> 31:49.940
We used to come out here before
the Christmas Eve show...

31:50.009 --> 31:52.109
and make a lot of wishes
into that fountain.

31:52.144 --> 31:53.610
Yeah.

31:53.646 --> 31:56.213
I bet you if they saved every
penny that we threw in there...

31:56.248 --> 31:58.159
they probably could have bought
a whole new fountain.

31:58.183 --> 32:01.852
Probably! We had a lot
of dreams back then.

32:01.887 --> 32:04.821
Yeah, we did.

32:04.857 --> 32:11.561
Um... how... how are you?

32:11.597 --> 32:13.697
I'm sorry. Can I ask that?
Is that weird?

32:13.732 --> 32:17.234
No, it's not weird.
I'm good. I'm good.

32:17.269 --> 32:21.138
I have a really great job,
a cute little house in L.A.

32:21.173 --> 32:22.173
Okay.

32:24.710 --> 32:27.644
You know, I heard that you moved
away after Daniel.

32:29.581 --> 32:31.515
I'm sorry.
It's okay.

32:31.550 --> 32:34.351
I had no idea that you were even
married...

32:34.386 --> 32:38.322
until my mom called me on tour
and I found out.

32:38.357 --> 32:39.823
It's just...
Yeah.

32:39.858 --> 32:44.695
We, um, we met about six months
after you left, and he was...

32:44.730 --> 32:48.565
I loved him, so we got married.
We just kind of knew.

32:48.600 --> 32:50.233
Then I had Nikki, and...

32:50.269 --> 32:53.270
But what about you?

32:53.305 --> 32:54.849
I mean, you came back to do
the Christmas show.

32:54.873 --> 32:57.341
Me? Yeah.

32:57.376 --> 33:01.678
You know, I, um, can't believe
it myself, but...

33:01.747 --> 33:03.058
no, it's good, it's good,
it's good.

33:03.082 --> 33:05.148
I'm... I'm happy to be back home
for Christmas...

33:05.184 --> 33:06.616
here at the Enchanted.

33:06.652 --> 33:10.554
Oh, this... this was Christmas.
This was Christmas every year.

33:10.589 --> 33:12.367
I mean, everybody we knew,
everybody we loved...

33:12.391 --> 33:14.324
they were here in one place.

33:14.393 --> 33:19.363
I don't know, I guess... I guess
I just kind of missed it.

33:22.368 --> 33:25.602
Listen, um... is there still
room for Nikki in the show?

33:29.008 --> 33:30.374
Really?

33:30.442 --> 33:33.944
I just think she needs to have
a little fun right now.

33:34.013 --> 33:37.647
Okay. Yes, of course. Plenty of
room. How about you?

33:38.784 --> 33:39.750
What about me?

33:39.785 --> 33:41.218
Well, after seeing the
ballroom...

33:41.253 --> 33:43.498
don't you want to be in the
Christmas show, dance a little?

33:43.522 --> 33:46.023
Oh, no. No!

33:46.058 --> 33:47.791
Not even a little?
Absolutely not!

33:47.826 --> 33:51.328
Not even a little bit.
Okay, come on. Come here.

33:51.363 --> 33:54.197
Okay, you know what? Uh-uh. I'm
going to make you a deal.

33:54.233 --> 33:55.699
Okay.

33:55.768 --> 33:57.612
You promise me that Nikki's
going to have a great time...

33:57.636 --> 34:00.937
in the show, and I will promise
you I won't tell my dad that...

34:00.973 --> 34:05.342
you actually tried to convince
me to be in the Christmas show.

34:05.377 --> 34:07.144
Deal.
Thank you.

34:17.523 --> 34:18.565
[RICARDO] Hey, go take five.

34:18.590 --> 34:20.389
Hey, Nikki?

34:20.458 --> 34:21.824
Oh, no, no. It's okay.

34:21.860 --> 34:24.428
We got a little problem, okay?
It's okay. No, I got it.

34:24.496 --> 34:26.463
It's okay.
Okay.

34:26.498 --> 34:28.498
Hey, what's going on?

34:28.567 --> 34:32.168
Uh, she is frustrated.

34:32.204 --> 34:33.815
The other girls are a little bit
ahead of her...

34:33.839 --> 34:35.438
because she came in late...

34:35.474 --> 34:39.309
and I guess you could say Nikki
is a bit, um... competitive.

34:39.344 --> 34:41.745
Oh.
Yeah... so.

34:41.780 --> 34:42.780
Okay.

34:52.424 --> 34:53.424
[MANUEL] What's her name?

34:54.226 --> 34:55.926
Who?

34:55.960 --> 34:59.529
The girl in the dance group that
thinks she's better than you.

35:00.265 --> 35:01.665
Danielle.

35:01.700 --> 35:05.068
She knows the steps better
than me.

35:05.104 --> 35:07.804
Hm. Is the dance too hard?

35:07.840 --> 35:10.006
No.

35:10.042 --> 35:12.342
It's just that Danielle
is better.

35:12.377 --> 35:15.545
No. I'm as good as her.

35:15.614 --> 35:18.148
But everyone else will think
she's better than you.

35:18.217 --> 35:20.350
They will?

35:20.385 --> 35:23.253
Until you go back in there
and prove her wrong.

35:34.266 --> 35:35.266
Hey.

35:38.303 --> 35:40.270
All right, let's do this.

35:40.305 --> 35:41.338
All right!

35:41.406 --> 35:42.939
I'm feeling some deja vu.

35:46.478 --> 35:47.911
Oh, let me guess.

35:47.946 --> 35:51.681
You gave her the "She thinks
she's better than you" speech?

35:51.717 --> 35:53.316
You can't argue with the
classics.

35:54.620 --> 35:55.620
Okay.

36:01.093 --> 36:02.592
Look who it is.

36:02.661 --> 36:03.960
Hey.
Christmas shopping?

36:03.996 --> 36:05.662
Uh, yeah, Nikki's wish list.

36:05.731 --> 36:07.631
I'm actually headed back
to the lodge.

36:07.666 --> 36:08.666
Me, too. Can I help?

36:08.700 --> 36:10.333
Yes.
Okay, good.

36:10.369 --> 36:12.169
Thank you. Oh.

36:12.237 --> 36:14.171
Hey, how's the finale coming
with Taylor?

36:14.206 --> 36:16.806
Oh, it's good, it's really good.
Yeah?

36:16.842 --> 36:18.453
I mean, not as good as back
when you and I were partners...

36:18.477 --> 36:20.977
but it's good.
Oh, well, of course not.

36:21.013 --> 36:23.480
We have been together for many
years, so.

36:23.515 --> 36:25.148
Ooh, together?

36:25.217 --> 36:26.349
Professionally.

36:26.385 --> 36:29.085
We started as friends on the
dance tour...

36:29.121 --> 36:30.787
and stayed friends ever since.

36:30.822 --> 36:33.990
How about you?
Uh, there's a guy.

36:34.026 --> 36:35.692
Oh, a guy.
Scott.

36:35.761 --> 36:37.861
Scott. Cool!

36:37.896 --> 36:39.796
Well, how's the rest of the
lodge coming...

36:39.831 --> 36:41.075
because the ballroom looks
amazing.

36:41.099 --> 36:43.133
Oh, good, good.
It's coming along.

36:43.202 --> 36:44.668
Okay, well, if you need any
help...

36:44.703 --> 36:46.870
I'm actually a hotel expert.

36:46.939 --> 36:48.383
I've lived in hotels for the
last 10 years.

36:48.407 --> 36:50.373
Really?
Yeah.

36:50.409 --> 36:52.442
Okay, what would your number one
complaint be?

36:52.477 --> 36:54.244
Number one complaint?
Uh... hangers.

36:55.147 --> 36:56.513
Hangers!
Yeah.

36:56.548 --> 36:57.414
Okay, I was not expecting that.

36:57.482 --> 36:59.349
No, there's never enough
hangers.

36:59.384 --> 37:01.718
Okay, and don't even get me
started.

37:01.753 --> 37:03.364
Those... those metal ones that
like they stick in the thing...

37:03.388 --> 37:04.721
and you can't really get
them out.

37:04.790 --> 37:05.934
Oh, those're the worst!
Ah, thank you!

37:05.958 --> 37:07.257
Oh! Yeah.

37:07.292 --> 37:08.992
Okay, hold on, hold on.
How about soap?

37:09.027 --> 37:10.527
I don't like the soap.

37:10.562 --> 37:12.028
You don't like soap.

37:12.097 --> 37:14.275
No, they're so small and when
you try and like fit them...

37:14.299 --> 37:15.865
in your hands, they always
slip out.

37:15.901 --> 37:17.679
You can't get a good lather.
Why am I telling you this?

37:17.703 --> 37:19.936
No, no!

37:19.972 --> 37:23.840
Thank you. I have a lot
to work on now.

37:23.875 --> 37:26.309
Yeah.
I'll see you tomorrow?

37:26.378 --> 37:29.112
Yeah, yeah. I should be around.

37:29.147 --> 37:31.481
Um, can I ask you a question?

37:31.550 --> 37:32.550
Yeah.

37:32.584 --> 37:34.184
It's kind of random.

37:34.219 --> 37:39.122
But, um... if the fountain
was outside still...

37:39.191 --> 37:40.890
what would your Christmas
wish be?

37:43.061 --> 37:44.961
That's a good one. Um...

37:45.030 --> 37:47.964
No pressure.
Okay.

37:48.000 --> 37:52.469
Uh, well, that Nikki would be
happy, that's my number one.

37:52.504 --> 37:53.770
Of course.

37:53.805 --> 37:55.805
And that this lodge gets done.

37:55.841 --> 38:00.577
Um... and that I'd fall
in love again.

38:03.548 --> 38:05.048
You?

38:05.083 --> 38:06.083
Me?

38:08.420 --> 38:11.154
Hangers and soap.
Hangers and soaps.

38:11.189 --> 38:14.791
Yep. Yeah, something... something
like that.

38:14.860 --> 38:17.360
<i>( PHONE RINGS )</i>
Ah, oh, sorry.

38:18.930 --> 38:20.041
Do you have to take that?
Yes.

38:20.065 --> 38:21.698
Yeah, okay.
Okay.

38:21.733 --> 38:22.966
Well... I know.
I'll see you.

38:23.001 --> 38:26.469
Thanks again.
Uh, hey.

38:26.505 --> 38:28.738
Hey! We've been missing
each other.

38:28.774 --> 38:30.507
Ugh, I know. It's okay.

38:30.542 --> 38:32.309
It's... it's just good to hear
your voice.

38:32.344 --> 38:33.554
Well, you might not think so...

38:33.578 --> 38:35.245
when you hear what I have
to say.

38:35.314 --> 38:36.713
What do you mean?

38:36.782 --> 38:39.516
Oliver reviewed the progress
reports and he is not happy.

38:39.551 --> 38:41.151
About what?

38:41.186 --> 38:42.719
He's worried about the deadline.

38:42.788 --> 38:44.632
<i>[LAURA] Why is Oliver coming
to you instead of me?</i>

38:44.656 --> 38:48.024
Okay, fine, well, you can tell
Oliver that we're on schedule...

38:48.060 --> 38:50.026
<i>and on budget, and if he's
still not happy...</i>

38:50.062 --> 38:51.939
<i>he can come down here and run
this project himself.</i>

38:51.963 --> 38:54.064
<i>I didn't even want to be here
in the first place.</i>

38:54.132 --> 38:55.632
You really want me to tell
him that?

38:55.667 --> 38:56.966
No!

38:57.002 --> 39:00.570
I don't really feel like getting
fired today. I just...

39:00.605 --> 39:02.272
I will call Oliver tomorrow...

39:02.307 --> 39:05.642
and I will run him through
the progress step-by-step.

39:05.677 --> 39:07.344
You know what, that's okay.

39:07.379 --> 39:08.745
I will talk him off the ledge.

39:08.780 --> 39:11.147
No, no, it's okay.

39:11.183 --> 39:15.418
Honestly, it was a lot better
hearing it all from you, so...

39:15.454 --> 39:18.488
um, hey, I actually have to run,
but I will call you tomorrow.

39:18.523 --> 39:19.389
<i>SCOTT (OVER PHONE)
Okay. Bye.</i>

39:19.424 --> 39:20.957
Bye.

39:25.530 --> 39:30.166
[CLAUDIA]
When? Well, it's ruined.

39:30.202 --> 39:32.102
Why can't you just find someone
else to do it?

39:32.137 --> 39:33.470
Because we're the grand finale.

39:33.505 --> 39:35.149
I mean, they've been doing
this for 75 years.

39:35.173 --> 39:36.573
It's... it's a tradition.

39:36.641 --> 39:39.609
We can't just... we can't
just not do it.

39:39.644 --> 39:41.678
What's going on?

39:41.713 --> 39:43.947
Taylor over here has a new
audition for some...

39:43.982 --> 39:46.516
new European tour, but I can't
take it...

39:46.551 --> 39:47.995
because I'm already committed
to the show.

39:48.019 --> 39:51.321
Which is why we have been able
to sell a ton of tickets.

39:51.390 --> 39:54.224
He's the hometown boy who went
out and made it big.

39:54.259 --> 39:55.492
If he's not in the show...

39:55.527 --> 39:57.071
people are going to want
their money back.

39:57.095 --> 40:01.064
I am sorry, but this is too big
to say no to.

40:01.133 --> 40:02.632
What if you don't even
get the role?

40:04.536 --> 40:08.037
Trust me, that's not gonna
be an issue.

40:08.106 --> 40:11.040
Well, couldn't you just go to
the audition and come back?

40:11.076 --> 40:13.877
It's in London in three days.
Okay?

40:13.945 --> 40:15.345
If I drop out now...

40:15.414 --> 40:17.714
that'll give you a chance to
find somebody else to do it.

40:17.749 --> 40:19.182
You've got two weeks.

40:19.217 --> 40:21.151
How are we supposed to find
someone to do this...

40:21.186 --> 40:24.387
who's good enough to do this
in such short notice?

40:32.631 --> 40:34.764
Why is everybody looking at me?

40:39.504 --> 40:42.939
I cannot believe I am doing
this.

40:42.974 --> 40:46.476
You know, neither can I.
Oh!

40:46.511 --> 40:49.546
If the show doesn't end well, it
reflects badly on the lodge...

40:49.581 --> 40:51.147
and my boss is already
pretty upset.

40:51.183 --> 40:54.717
So, the show must go on, right?

40:54.753 --> 40:59.456
Yes, the show must go on.
Exactly! So, come on.

40:59.524 --> 41:00.890
Okay. Okay.

41:00.926 --> 41:03.359
So, we're not gonna be doing
the salsa like we used to.

41:03.428 --> 41:04.594
Mm-hm.

41:04.629 --> 41:06.696
We're gonna be doing a
traditional foxtrot...

41:06.731 --> 41:08.465
with a few added bells
and whistles.

41:08.500 --> 41:10.600
Which I was never good
at the foxtrot, so...

41:10.635 --> 41:13.269
We're just going to do some
basic moves...

41:13.338 --> 41:15.839
and let's see where you're at.

41:15.874 --> 41:17.607
You mean how rusty I am.

41:17.642 --> 41:19.909
It's like riding a bike.
A rusty bike.

41:19.978 --> 41:20.978
Okay.
You ready?

41:21.012 --> 41:23.780
Yes.
Here we go. Slow.

41:23.815 --> 41:25.181
Quick, quick.

41:25.217 --> 41:26.149
Okay.
I'm sorry, I thought it's...

41:26.184 --> 41:27.984
It's okay, it's okay.

41:28.019 --> 41:29.652
Okay, wait.
Slow, quick, quick, slow.

41:29.721 --> 41:31.321
Yes, exactly.
Slow, slow. Slow, slow.

41:31.356 --> 41:34.524
So just breathe. Here we go.
And slow.

41:37.729 --> 41:39.462
Okay? Okay?
Good!

41:39.498 --> 41:41.297
Feels better... ah...
Good!

41:41.333 --> 41:43.266
Are you nervous?

41:43.335 --> 41:47.403
No. Yes... yes.
Well, you shouldn't be nervous.

41:47.439 --> 41:49.906
Shake it out, like the kids do.
Okay.

41:49.941 --> 41:51.853
Shake it out, shake it out.
Stop. I'm shaking it out.

41:51.877 --> 41:52.775
Let's go.
Okay, ready?

41:52.811 --> 41:54.944
Okay.

41:55.013 --> 41:57.881

Okay, I think we need to start
with some green.

42:43.428 --> 42:45.361
What about... this one!
Oh!

42:46.831 --> 42:49.432
The joys of being a dancer, huh?

42:49.467 --> 42:52.101
Oh... of using muscles
I forgot I had.

42:52.137 --> 42:54.137
How do you forget muscles?

42:54.172 --> 42:57.307
Well, it's actually from sitting
at a desk for way too long.

42:57.375 --> 42:59.353
Well, I'm just glad you're back
doing what you love.

42:59.377 --> 43:02.412
Used to love and used to be
good at.

43:02.447 --> 43:06.883
Oh, I forgot about this!
Do you remember this ornament?

43:06.952 --> 43:09.085
Wait, where did we get it?
Salt Lake City, remember?

43:09.120 --> 43:10.453
Oh, yes.

43:10.522 --> 43:11.866
We snuck down to go to that
concert...

43:11.890 --> 43:13.668
and then there was this freak
snowstorm and we...

43:13.692 --> 43:14.991
Uh...

43:15.060 --> 43:17.994
And we stayed inside all day
and went to bed early.

43:18.029 --> 43:18.995
[LAURA] We absolutely did!

43:19.030 --> 43:21.297
So, it snows there,
but not here?

43:21.333 --> 43:22.832
It will snow here, Nikki.

43:22.867 --> 43:24.233
Grandpa, I'm skeptical.

43:24.302 --> 43:25.602
Whoa!

43:25.637 --> 43:27.437
Where did you learn that word?

43:27.472 --> 43:29.483
Grandpa said it when Ricardo
was telling him that...

43:29.507 --> 43:32.408
you wouldn't get her dancing.
He told me what it meant.

43:32.444 --> 43:34.210
Oh, he did, did he?

43:34.245 --> 43:35.378
Yep.

43:35.413 --> 43:37.447
Did I use it right, Grandpa?
Yes, you did.

43:37.482 --> 43:39.415
Nice work.

43:39.451 --> 43:41.384
Dad, can I just talk to you
for a second?

43:41.419 --> 43:43.686
We have to get the tree done.

43:43.722 --> 43:45.166
Girls, do you have the tree
for a little bit?

43:45.190 --> 43:49.726
Yes, of course.
Yes? Come on.

43:49.794 --> 43:51.872
All right, well, why don't we
start with some reds now?

43:51.896 --> 43:53.096
Okay.
Let's get some reds.

43:53.131 --> 43:56.332
[NIKKI] This one.
[ALICIA] Perfect! What about...

43:56.368 --> 43:57.667
Why are you talking to Ricardo?

43:57.736 --> 43:58.913
[ALICIA]
Go place your stocking up there.

43:58.937 --> 44:00.970
I'm not allowed to talk to him?
Not about me.

44:02.841 --> 44:05.141
I don't like you and him again.

44:05.176 --> 44:06.876
I am not with him.

44:06.911 --> 44:09.579
We are just doing the Christmas
show together.

44:09.614 --> 44:12.115
I'm being very careful.
I'm not going to get hurt.

44:12.183 --> 44:14.917
I'm just... I'm just a little
sore.

44:16.454 --> 44:18.988
I didn't mean that kind of hurt.

44:19.024 --> 44:21.324
No, I know.

44:21.359 --> 44:24.394
We are going to have
an amazing Christmas.

44:24.429 --> 44:28.064
You and me and Nikki at the
Enchanted just like...

44:28.099 --> 44:31.234
we always used to every year,
and afterwards we're going...

44:31.302 --> 44:33.014
to go back to L.A. and we're
going to have our own life...

44:33.038 --> 44:35.772
and Ricardo will go wherever
he's gonna go...

44:35.807 --> 44:38.174
Europe or Asia, or tour
wherever.

44:38.209 --> 44:40.343
I am being careful.

44:42.280 --> 44:44.313
Want a cookie?

44:51.289 --> 44:53.289
The whole thing. Let's pull the
whole thing down.

44:53.324 --> 44:54.590
All right, get that corner.

44:54.626 --> 44:58.127
All right, here we go.
Five, six, seven, eight.

44:58.163 --> 45:02.732
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight.

45:02.801 --> 45:08.171
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight. Yes!

45:08.206 --> 45:10.673
Oh, hey, you guys don't want
any Christmas cookies...

45:10.742 --> 45:12.542
or hot chocolate, do you?

45:12.577 --> 45:15.712
Yes!
Well, come on. Woo!

45:15.747 --> 45:18.715
Hey, save me a cookie.
Okay.

45:18.750 --> 45:20.216
Ricardo?
Yeah, what's up, Nikki?

45:20.251 --> 45:21.484
I always forget the part...

45:21.519 --> 45:23.319
that comes after we're
in the big circle.

45:23.388 --> 45:26.355
Uh, okay. Okay.

45:26.391 --> 45:28.458
So, we've got to help you
remember it.

45:28.493 --> 45:31.928
Um, name me three things that
you love during Christmastime.

45:31.996 --> 45:36.032
Presents. Christmas cookies.
Love those.

45:36.067 --> 45:39.135
Santa.
Santa. Good job. High five.

45:39.170 --> 45:41.215
So, this first part, we're going
to call it Christmas presents...

45:41.239 --> 45:42.583
because you're going
to reach out...

45:42.607 --> 45:43.651
and you're going to grab all
the Christmas presents.

45:43.675 --> 45:45.508
Try it. Exactly.

45:45.543 --> 45:47.744
And now put your feet together.
Boom!

45:47.779 --> 45:49.912
This next part we're going
to call it Santa Claus...

45:49.981 --> 45:52.181
so we're gonna ball change,
grab the chimney...

45:52.217 --> 45:55.752
and spin all the way around,
you got it? Perfect!

45:55.787 --> 45:57.198
You said that you like cookies,
right?

45:57.222 --> 45:58.488
I love cookies!

45:58.523 --> 46:00.423
Okay, this next part is my
favorite part...

46:00.458 --> 46:01.924
it's called cookies.

46:01.993 --> 46:04.071
So, you're gonna take a step
back, you're going to grab...

46:04.095 --> 46:06.240
the cookies, and you're going to
take them back to your room...

46:06.264 --> 46:08.164
so you can eat all of them,
you got it?

46:08.199 --> 46:09.632
All right, let's try it.
Here we go.

46:09.667 --> 46:13.669
So, we have Christmas presents,
feet together.

46:13.705 --> 46:16.205
And now we're going to do Santa
Claus, grab the chimney...

46:16.274 --> 46:19.041
spin all the way around,
and then grab those cookies.

46:19.077 --> 46:20.254
Step back, grab the cookies...

46:20.278 --> 46:21.756
and bring them all the way
back to your room.

46:21.780 --> 46:23.679
You got it?
Yeah!

46:23.748 --> 46:25.915
Good job! Now go get some hot
chocolate, cookies.

46:25.950 --> 46:28.017
Enjoy and have some fun, okay?

46:30.555 --> 46:32.255
Thank you.

46:32.323 --> 46:34.824
I'm just doing my job.

46:34.859 --> 46:39.695
You just... never really seemed
like the kid kinda guy.

46:39.731 --> 46:45.034
Well, when you knew me,
I was a kid and I grew up.

46:45.069 --> 46:47.081
Says the guy who just labeled
his choreography as Santa...

46:47.105 --> 46:48.871
presents, and cookies.

46:48.907 --> 46:51.240
You know what, you can say what
you want, but sometimes...

46:51.309 --> 46:54.477
it takes, you know, just seeing
things from a different angle.

46:54.512 --> 46:56.490
You know, changing the way that
your brain thinks...

46:56.514 --> 46:58.815
so you can actually get the
result that you want.

46:58.850 --> 47:00.149
It's not that hard.

47:00.185 --> 47:04.720
Yeah, I wish I could get the
results that I want.

47:04.789 --> 47:06.322
You know, I just...

47:06.391 --> 47:09.492
I think that you're too hard
on yourself sometimes.

47:09.527 --> 47:14.297
It's just... how do you
think I'm doing?

47:14.365 --> 47:16.032
I think you're doing great.

47:16.067 --> 47:17.466
It's gonna...

47:17.502 --> 47:20.036
it's gonna take some time,
but I think you're doing great.

47:20.071 --> 47:21.571
We have two weeks.

47:21.606 --> 47:23.673
Yeah, and you have a whole team
around you.

47:23.708 --> 47:26.909
It's not just on you,
so relax.

47:26.945 --> 47:30.246
Okay? Okay?
Okay.

47:31.983 --> 47:35.151
You know what?
I just got an idea...

47:35.186 --> 47:37.486
and it's gonna help you see
things from a different angle.

47:37.555 --> 47:38.833
Five minutes, meet me
in the parking lot.

47:38.857 --> 47:40.523
Bring Nikki.

47:40.558 --> 47:42.992

[LAURA]
Wow, what's going on?

48:34.412 --> 48:38.481
Oh, I-I found four more boxes
of Christmas decorations...

48:38.549 --> 48:40.983
and so I'm pretty sure they're
plotting something.

48:41.019 --> 48:42.785
How was practice, Mom?

48:42.820 --> 48:45.054
Oh, it was... it was good.

48:45.089 --> 48:47.890
Hard, um, it's a style I'm not
really used to.

48:47.959 --> 48:49.091
And the lodge?

48:49.127 --> 48:51.861
You're not forgetting about your
job, are you?

48:51.896 --> 48:55.531
I am working during the day and
I'm rehearsing in the evening.

48:55.600 --> 48:57.300
And what about Christmas?

48:57.368 --> 48:58.368
Well, I'm here now.

49:00.405 --> 49:03.739
<i>( PHONE RINGS )</i>

49:07.645 --> 49:12.682
Hi, this is Laura.
Yes, now is a good time.

49:12.717 --> 49:16.585
Yes, of course, of course.

49:16.621 --> 49:18.020
Is this it? Done here?

49:18.056 --> 49:19.588
[EDDIE]
Well, we have a huge problem.

49:19.624 --> 49:20.957
The moving company called...

49:20.992 --> 49:22.536
and one of their vans is out
of commission.

49:22.560 --> 49:23.826
Okay?

49:23.861 --> 49:25.439
They can't deliver the furniture
until the 28th.

49:25.463 --> 49:27.697
The... we open on the 24th.

49:27.732 --> 49:29.498
Yeah, I told them that.

49:29.534 --> 49:32.168
So, what? We're not supposed to
have furniture for four days?

49:32.203 --> 49:34.470
Uh, looks like it's gonna
be that way.

49:34.505 --> 49:35.705
That's unacceptable!

49:35.740 --> 49:38.074
Yeah, I told them that, too.

49:38.109 --> 49:39.308
What did they say?

49:39.377 --> 49:41.277
"See you on the 28th."

49:41.346 --> 49:44.280
Oh, no, you know what,
where is their number?

49:44.315 --> 49:47.216
I'm gonna call them right now...
and I'm gonna figure this out.

49:47.251 --> 49:49.051
No, it's going to be fine.
Okay.

49:49.120 --> 49:50.686
Group one, come over here,
please.

49:53.091 --> 49:56.692
Oh, we still need more Christmas
decorations for around the room.

49:56.761 --> 49:59.695
But I don't have much left
in the budget.

49:59.731 --> 50:02.898
It needs to be super merry
and super cheap.

50:02.934 --> 50:05.101
[NIKKI]
What's wrong, Danielle?

50:05.136 --> 50:07.403
I can't get this one part
right...

50:07.472 --> 50:11.440
like I keep forgetting
how it goes.

50:11.509 --> 50:13.642
[NIKKI] Oh, that's candy cane.
[DANIELLE] What?

50:13.678 --> 50:18.214
You go like this and then this.
Twice around the candy cane.

50:18.249 --> 50:20.216
See? Candy cane.

50:20.284 --> 50:21.784
Thanks, Nikki.

50:21.819 --> 50:22.918
You know what?

50:22.954 --> 50:24.720
I saw some boxes in the storage
room.

50:24.756 --> 50:26.100
We could wrap them in wrapping
paper...

50:26.124 --> 50:27.267
and make them look like
Christmas presents.

50:27.291 --> 50:28.624
I love it!
I love it.

50:28.659 --> 50:30.726
I have a bunch of wrapping paper
at home.

50:30.762 --> 50:32.128
I know you do.

50:32.163 --> 50:33.129
I'm going to go try and grab
them.

50:33.164 --> 50:34.164
Thank you.
Yes!

50:50.314 --> 50:52.214
Well, how about that?

50:59.290 --> 51:02.258
We are going to buy
an overpriced sideboard...

51:02.326 --> 51:04.471
from the antique guy, who's
gonna give us the football...

51:04.495 --> 51:06.662
tickets for the paint guys, who
are going to lend us...

51:06.697 --> 51:09.498
their truck and their crew to
get the movers here...

51:09.534 --> 51:12.234
on the 22nd, so everything can
be done by the 24th.

51:12.270 --> 51:13.769
Whoa! Am I missing anything?

51:13.805 --> 51:15.538
Did somebody order some
magic beans?

51:15.573 --> 51:18.874
No... I think we did it.

51:18.910 --> 51:20.976
Eddie, thank you so much.

51:21.012 --> 51:23.012
I could not have done it
without you.

51:23.047 --> 51:24.346
Thank you!

51:24.382 --> 51:26.248
You know what, if we hurry up...

51:26.284 --> 51:27.728
we can make it to the
tree-lighting ceremony.

51:27.752 --> 51:29.351
Yes! See you there?
Yeah.

51:29.420 --> 51:30.920
All right.

51:32.423 --> 51:34.490
Uh, hey.
Hey!

51:34.525 --> 51:36.158
I am so sorry I missed
rehearsal.

51:36.227 --> 51:38.594
No, no! All good.

51:38.663 --> 51:41.997
Um, I actually found something
else to do. Do you want to see?

51:42.066 --> 51:43.966
You know what,
the tree lighting is...

51:44.035 --> 51:47.670
Five minutes. I promise.

51:47.705 --> 51:50.039
Okay.
Come on.

No peeking, no peeking.

Here we go. Ready?
Okay.

One... two... three.

51:59.784 --> 52:02.418
Where did... how did you
find...?

52:02.453 --> 52:04.386
I-I found it under a tarp.

52:04.455 --> 52:06.522
I-I-I guess they meant to put
it back together...

52:06.591 --> 52:07.591
and they just forgot.

52:07.625 --> 52:10.726
I cannot believe this is here!

52:10.795 --> 52:12.895
Okay, so right over here is
where we used to take...

52:12.930 --> 52:15.064
all the pictures right before
the Christmas show.

52:15.099 --> 52:16.632
Yeah.

52:16.667 --> 52:19.401
We would make our Christmas Eve
wishes and throw our pennies in.

52:19.437 --> 52:22.972
Oh, and over here is where
we had that big fight...

52:23.007 --> 52:24.840
when you threw the Christmas
ornament.

52:24.909 --> 52:26.942
Ye-yeah, sorry.

52:27.011 --> 52:28.911
Look, I-I did all this...

52:28.980 --> 52:31.881
because I didn't want that
to be our last memory.

52:34.085 --> 52:35.384
Okay.

52:35.453 --> 52:37.887
You already know my Christmas
wish for the future.

52:37.922 --> 52:39.688
Okay.

52:39.724 --> 52:41.457
I want to know what yours
would be.

52:41.492 --> 52:43.192
Other than hangers and soap.

52:43.227 --> 52:44.347
Those are important, though.

52:48.466 --> 52:52.401
I think it's time that I buy
my own hangers and soap.

52:52.436 --> 52:55.804
And hopefully find someone
to share it with.

52:57.875 --> 53:00.109
And maybe a Christmas dance.

Uh, no. I guess I'm actually
kind of used to it.

53:43.354 --> 53:46.655
We're gonna need to get
you back to L.A.

53:46.691 --> 53:49.925
Why did you come out here?
Really, why are you out here?

53:49.961 --> 53:53.062
What? Because I wanted
to see you.

53:53.097 --> 53:54.608
And it had nothing to do
with the fact...

53:54.632 --> 53:56.498
that Oliver was worried
about the lodge?

53:56.567 --> 53:58.701
No, not at all.

53:58.736 --> 54:01.670
Okay, because I have everything
under control.

54:01.706 --> 54:06.308
I'm sure you do, but since I'm
here, I might as well help out.

54:06.344 --> 54:08.410
Although I'm not exactly sure...

54:08.446 --> 54:09.979
why you want to be part
of the show.

54:10.047 --> 54:13.315
Well, Ricardo's an old friend of
mine, and the show is really...

54:13.351 --> 54:16.952
important, and it gives the
lodge a big grand opening night.

54:17.021 --> 54:18.198
Well, if the lodge isn't
finished...

54:18.222 --> 54:20.689
then there may not be
a grand opening night.

54:20.758 --> 54:24.326
I... thought you believed that
I had it under control.

54:24.362 --> 54:29.898
I do. I do. I just... I don't
want you to be distracted.

to send me out here.

behind before I pitched in.

Oh, really?

01:01:57.448 --> 01:01:59.114
Because I think you just
lied to me...

01:01:59.183 --> 01:02:01.349
and I think you bad-mouthed
me to our boss.

01:02:01.385 --> 01:02:03.118
So how is that not what I think?

01:02:03.153 --> 01:02:06.188
Oliver was worried. He wasn't
going to listen to me or you.

01:02:06.223 --> 01:02:08.857
I had to do something drastic.

01:02:08.926 --> 01:02:11.593
Trust me, this...
was for your own good.

01:02:11.662 --> 01:02:14.963
"Trust me." Well, you know what,
my father was right.

01:02:14.998 --> 01:02:16.898
Never trust someone who says
"Trust me."

01:02:20.537 --> 01:02:21.537
I'm really sorry.

01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:25.240
Okay. Then fix it.

01:02:26.310 --> 01:02:27.809
How?

01:02:27.845 --> 01:02:31.346
If you're actually sorry, call
Oliver and tell him the truth.

01:02:31.381 --> 01:02:33.014
Uh, Laura, I need to go over...

01:02:33.083 --> 01:02:34.227
the opening night party plans
with you.

01:02:34.251 --> 01:02:35.684
I need you to give me a minute.

01:02:35.719 --> 01:02:38.820
Oh, hey, Laura. Can I... talk
to you for a second?

01:02:38.856 --> 01:02:40.088
Laura...
I just...

01:02:40.124 --> 01:02:41.790
We need to finish this
conversation.

01:03:00.611 --> 01:03:02.188
And make sure you get it done
before they come over.

01:03:02.212 --> 01:03:03.612
Right, of course.

01:03:03.647 --> 01:03:05.558

you're not dating Scott anymore.

01:03:05.582 --> 01:03:09.251
Oh, no, that is <i> way</i> over.

01:03:09.286 --> 01:03:12.354

makes room for Ricardo, okay?

01:13:57.033 --> 01:13:58.466
Uh-hm.

01:13:58.535 --> 01:14:02.937
You've done such an amazing job
here. You should be so proud.

01:14:02.972 --> 01:14:04.939
Thank you.

01:14:04.974 --> 01:14:06.374
It was a team effort.

01:14:06.409 --> 01:14:08.309
I couldn't have done it
without Eddie.

01:14:08.344 --> 01:14:09.477

Every great team needs

I cannot wait for your new
assignment.

01:14:16.119 --> 01:14:18.519
I'm sorry, you're not firing me?

01:14:18.555 --> 01:14:20.822
Firing you? Why?

01:14:20.857 --> 01:14:21.689
Well, because Scott...

01:14:21.724 --> 01:14:23.958
Oh, Scott? Him I fired.

01:14:24.027 --> 01:14:26.794
He had some kind of a conscience
awakening.

01:14:26.830 --> 01:14:29.697
He told me he wasn't being
honest with either one of us.

01:14:29.732 --> 01:14:32.867
I don't know, maybe it was
a Christmas miracle.

01:14:32.936 --> 01:14:37.071
Anyway, I'm not the kind of guy
to say I'm sorry.

01:14:38.308 --> 01:14:39.407
But...

01:14:39.442 --> 01:14:41.943

Oh.

01:14:42.011 --> 01:14:44.312

And welcome to the grand
opening of the Enchanted Lodge.

01:15:08.438 --> 01:15:12.340
My name is Laura Trudeau, and I
am pleased to be presenting...

01:15:12.375 --> 01:15:15.409
the 75th annual
Enchanted Christmas show.

01:15:16.179 --> 01:15:17.745
Yay!

01:15:20.483 --> 01:15:24.185
When you get to work with a
group like this, they sort of...

01:15:24.220 --> 01:15:27.922
become like an extended family,
and over the last few weeks...

01:15:27.957 --> 01:15:31.325
I've really come to understand
the importance of family...

01:15:31.361 --> 01:15:34.695
especially during the holiday
season.

01:15:34.731 --> 01:15:37.665
And now that you are all
a part of this family...

01:15:37.700 --> 01:15:41.335
I promise you these doors will
always be open to you.

01:15:41.371 --> 01:15:46.607
I will make sure of it, because
now, I am so excited to say...

01:15:46.676 --> 01:15:50.244
I am the new general manager
of the Enchanted Lodge.

01:15:51.981 --> 01:15:53.381

01:15:58.721 --> 01:16:00.388
Merry Christmas, everyone.

01:16:00.423 --> 01:16:04.692

importantly, have fun.

01:16:04.727 --> 01:16:06.727

again next year, okay?

next year?

to be busy. I'm so sorry.

to the airport.

I did.

Uh, I had to let Taylor know
that I was gonna be staying.

01:19:10.046 --> 01:19:13.280
You cannot give up an
opportunity like that for me.

01:19:13.316 --> 01:19:15.649

than that.
