22:57.744 --> 22:59.879
at a romantic little spot
in Berlin

23:00.480 --> 23:02.014
called Tempelhof,

23:03.082 --> 23:05.852
which has
a cozy transit lounge.

23:05.885 --> 23:08.621
To get inside,
you walk through
the metal detectors,

23:08.655 --> 23:10.790
and I walk through
the metal detectors.

23:10.823 --> 23:12.692
And since you know
I'm not armed,

23:12.725 --> 23:14.861
and I know
you're not armed,

23:14.894 --> 23:17.597
we can both fall in love
and nobody gets hurt.

23:31.343 --> 23:32.879
ILYA: I can't see him.

23:33.480 --> 23:35.482
Then look for him.

23:35.515 --> 23:38.618
TEMPLAR: (IN GERMAN ACCENT)
You have a long
and beautiful cane...

23:38.651 --> 23:40.853
...along with
your beautiful eyes.

23:43.723 --> 23:45.792
That photograph
doesn't do you justice.

23:46.493 --> 23:47.527
Who are you?

23:47.560 --> 23:49.562
My name is
Bruno Hautenfaust.

23:49.596 --> 23:52.899
I was named for a saint
who was a very
wealthy man.

23:52.932 --> 23:55.034
Had the wine,
the women, the songs,
the whole bit,

23:55.067 --> 23:58.838
and then inexplicably
took a vow of poverty
and became a hermit,

23:58.871 --> 24:01.508
went off to live
in the forest
in the nude.

24:02.041 --> 24:03.476
Please leave.

24:05.144 --> 24:07.146
I represent
the professional
you hired.

24:08.047 --> 24:09.381
I'm his
business manager.

24:09.982 --> 24:11.150
I speak for him.

24:11.984 --> 24:14.153
We don't deal
with underlings.

24:14.186 --> 24:15.588
Come on, Father.
Let's go.

24:17.389 --> 24:20.459
TRETIAK:
Wait. Sit down.
Listen and learn.

24:20.493 --> 24:21.828
Ah. Youth.

24:26.599 --> 24:28.134
Who runs this thief?

24:28.768 --> 24:31.771
CIA, MI-6, Libya?

24:31.804 --> 24:33.673
He's not a race car.
Nobody runs him.

24:33.706 --> 24:35.675
He's an independent
contractor.

24:35.708 --> 24:38.444
Good. Then no one
will mind if I kill him.

24:39.846 --> 24:45.217
Oh, yes.
I can have a man killed
and stroll away like that,

24:45.251 --> 24:49.321
even with metal detectors,
even in this transit lounge.

24:50.957 --> 24:54.060
(YAWNS)
Oh, it's so early.

24:54.093 --> 24:56.028
You guys wanna get some
coffee or something?

24:57.930 --> 24:58.965
Sure.

25:03.169 --> 25:04.771
Be quiet.

25:04.804 --> 25:07.840
TEMPLAR: What is it
you request of my employer?

25:07.874 --> 25:10.176
Do you know
what cold fusion is?

25:10.209 --> 25:12.044
Of course.

25:12.078 --> 25:16.583
It's the theory
of nuclear fusion
at room temperature.

25:16.616 --> 25:18.050
Free energy forever.

25:18.084 --> 25:19.351
Yes.

25:19.385 --> 25:21.153
Kaffee?
Klein, bitte.

25:23.089 --> 25:26.926
As far as
science goes, it ranks
just above astrology.

25:26.959 --> 25:28.961
Those who claim
to have achieved
the experiment

25:28.995 --> 25:30.697
have never been able
to duplicate it.

25:31.263 --> 25:32.565
Until now.

25:34.400 --> 25:38.571
TRETIAK: There is
an electro-chemist
working at Oxford.

25:38.605 --> 25:40.807
We believe
that this good lady

25:40.840 --> 25:43.943
made a breakthrough
in cold fusion.

25:43.976 --> 25:47.479
Your employer will obtain
the formula for me.

25:47.980 --> 25:49.582
He's very busy.

25:49.616 --> 25:50.750
And you are
very boring.

25:51.784 --> 25:54.153
Your offer
must inspire him.

25:54.186 --> 25:59.525
This woman has repeatedly
avoided my agents' attempts
to find the formula.

26:00.192 --> 26:02.228
She's cagey, difficult.

26:03.930 --> 26:05.932
Maybe your agents
are stupid.

26:10.169 --> 26:14.506
I think this information
would cost you $3 million.

26:14.540 --> 26:16.909
(CHUCKLES)
Ridiculous.

26:16.943 --> 26:21.180
TEMPLAR: Why? You will have
the world market in energy.

26:21.213 --> 26:23.850
Cost you a nickel
for every million you make.

26:23.883 --> 26:25.618
His deposit
should go...
Hey...

26:26.185 --> 26:27.353
It is not for me.

26:28.420 --> 26:30.389
It is for Mother Russia.

26:30.422 --> 26:33.826
But you want
Mother Russia, too,
Mr. Tretiak.

26:33.860 --> 26:37.529
Three million on deposit
in a bank account
in Zurich. Agreed?

26:39.966 --> 26:41.968
Yes.

26:42.001 --> 26:46.405
And, uh, how long to get
your employer's agreement?

26:46.973 --> 26:48.007
I'll ask.

27:03.756 --> 27:06.158
Your offer
has inspired her.
I'll do it.

27:08.294 --> 27:10.062
Bank account number
in Zurich.

27:11.263 --> 27:13.065
Auf wiedersehen.
Bye, sonny.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.101
TRETIAK: Bye-bye.

27:16.502 --> 27:19.672
I really love this guy.
(CHUCKLES)

27:23.976 --> 27:25.644
Too bad
we have to kill him.

27:26.145 --> 27:27.446
Yeah, too bad.

27:42.795 --> 27:45.664
WOMAN:
When the electrochemists
Pons and Fleischman

27:45.698 --> 27:48.134
announced in 1989

27:48.167 --> 27:51.303
that they had discovered
cold fusion,

27:51.337 --> 27:54.606
a revolutionary process
of generating energy,

27:55.674 --> 27:59.211
they were at first
acclaimed as geniuses

27:59.245 --> 28:01.680
and then condemned
as charlatans.

28:03.315 --> 28:08.354
The protocols
of cold fusion...
What are those? Drugs?

28:08.387 --> 28:10.823
Could I have one?
My head's pounding.

28:10.857 --> 28:12.825
She's boring
the life out of me.

28:14.927 --> 28:16.662
They're for my heart.
Oh.

28:18.264 --> 28:21.333
You have
very pretty eyes.
You're a pretty lady.

28:22.234 --> 28:24.136
Who are you?
Me?

28:24.170 --> 28:26.906
I'm here to do
an interview
with that Dr. Russell.

28:26.939 --> 28:29.441
I'm gonna expose her
as a fraud.

28:29.475 --> 28:32.144
You don't put any stock
in this cold fusion
mumbo jumbo, do you?

28:32.879 --> 28:34.613
Actually, I do.
Really?

28:34.646 --> 28:36.783
Dr. Emma Russell.

28:44.757 --> 28:45.825
Oops.

28:50.629 --> 28:51.697
Well...

28:52.498 --> 28:55.567
I didn't prepare
any formal remarks.

28:56.402 --> 28:58.104
Um, I'm actually
more interested

28:58.137 --> 29:01.908
in what questions
you all have
about cold fusion,

29:01.941 --> 29:03.642
so I thought we would
start with those.

29:04.510 --> 29:05.677
EMMA: Any questions?

29:09.048 --> 29:10.983
Please?
Yeah. Yeah, I have,
Dr. Russell.

29:12.284 --> 29:15.454
Can you explain
the actual process
of fusion?

29:15.487 --> 29:16.823
You know, the theory.

29:17.824 --> 29:19.391
Yes. Oh, there it is.

29:20.793 --> 29:22.829
This is the...
The apparatus.

29:23.963 --> 29:25.097
And very simply,

29:25.865 --> 29:28.600
when positively charged
deuterons

29:28.634 --> 29:30.702
are attracted
to the palladium cathode,

29:31.570 --> 29:33.039
they cram together,

29:33.072 --> 29:36.342
and there are millions
and millions of them
inside the cathode,

29:36.375 --> 29:40.146
getting closer
and closer,
and then they fuse,

29:40.179 --> 29:42.581
and they create energy
in the form of helium.

29:42.614 --> 29:46.085
But I read somewhere
that the experiment
couldn't be replicated,

29:46.118 --> 29:48.654
so how do we know
it works?

29:49.588 --> 29:50.722
Well, we don't.

29:51.790 --> 29:52.859
Not yet.

29:54.060 --> 29:55.962
But if you
remember Einstein,

29:55.995 --> 29:59.231
he knew the theory
of relativity to be true

29:59.265 --> 30:00.766
long before
he could prove it.

30:00.799 --> 30:03.502
I mean,
he felt the truth.

30:03.535 --> 30:07.940
And, uh, some of us
feel the same way
about cold fusion

30:07.974 --> 30:10.376
because it's there.
It's in nature.

30:10.409 --> 30:15.114
The raw, natural power
just waiting
to be harnessed.

30:15.147 --> 30:19.551
And when we ignite
that cold fusion fire,

30:19.585 --> 30:21.720
I mean, just imagine.

30:23.022 --> 30:27.059
There's more energy
in one cubic mile
of sea water

30:27.093 --> 30:30.362
than in all the known
oil reserves on earth.

30:30.396 --> 30:34.233
I mean, you could
drive your car
55 million miles

30:34.266 --> 30:36.802
on a gallon
of heavy water.

30:36.835 --> 30:38.837
It would be
the end of pollution.

30:39.571 --> 30:42.074
Warmth for
the whole world.

30:43.642 --> 30:46.378
So why don't I, uh,
demonstrate for you

30:47.813 --> 30:51.283
why other people
in the past have been
so unsuccessful.

30:53.119 --> 30:54.486

High Street, Oxford.

31:03.695 --> 31:06.865
No alarms
on outer doors.
Strange.

31:24.216 --> 31:25.384
More books.

Tretiak's wrong.
She's not cagey.

33:32.178 --> 33:34.546
She's not difficult.
She's just...

33:35.481 --> 33:36.615
Eccentric.

33:37.449 --> 33:38.584
She's innocent.

33:45.924 --> 33:47.226
Maybe it's in her head.

33:49.295 --> 33:52.431
She needs a poet.
An artist.

33:54.032 --> 33:58.637
Someone who
understands truth.

34:06.445 --> 34:08.013
She needs Thomas More.

34:59.531 --> 35:02.534

Do you like it?

35:04.703 --> 35:07.139
Oh...yes.

35:08.374 --> 35:09.908
What do you love
about it?

35:19.951 --> 35:23.922
The way it...glows.

35:25.991 --> 35:28.126
And how the light...

35:29.228 --> 35:31.197
...holds him in silence,

35:32.898 --> 35:34.366
taking care of him.

35:36.602 --> 35:38.404
Yeah, that's what
I like about it.

35:43.008 --> 35:44.543
Are you an artist?

35:44.576 --> 35:49.448
No, just a traveler,
searching for purity.

35:50.949 --> 35:52.618
What do you search for?

35:52.651 --> 35:53.752
Energy.

35:53.785 --> 35:55.187
Yes.

35:58.290 --> 36:00.259
Have you ever been
on a long journey?

36:01.393 --> 36:03.128
No, not really.

36:05.931 --> 36:09.668
Perhaps I'll take you
to my home in Africa.

36:11.169 --> 36:15.073
You should experience
the energy of
where all life began.

36:21.247 --> 36:24.082
Sorry. I'm not
very good with people.

37:37.155 --> 37:38.457
Either way, it's weird.

37:39.991 --> 37:41.226
Very weird.

Destiny then.

37:55.173 --> 37:56.375
(BOTH LAUGHING)

37:56.408 --> 37:57.743
This must
look strange.

37:59.778 --> 38:01.212
It's, uh...

38:01.246 --> 38:03.382
Something that I'm
working on...

38:04.650 --> 38:08.119
...a formula for...
Creating energy.

38:09.988 --> 38:11.857

38:13.759 --> 38:16.862
(CHUCKLES) Yeah, I do.

38:30.308 --> 38:31.643
How did you do that?

38:33.845 --> 38:35.013
Magic.

38:35.881 --> 38:36.982
Give it back.

38:38.049 --> 38:39.918
It looks like Sanskrit.

38:39.951 --> 38:40.986
Give it back.

38:43.789 --> 38:46.425
I'm sorry. I just wanted
to watch you put it away.

38:49.260 --> 38:50.862
What else do you
keep in there?

38:52.063 --> 38:53.499
Nothing.

38:53.532 --> 38:54.766
That's not true.

38:56.602 --> 38:58.637
Can I get you
anything else?

39:01.407 --> 39:05.744
Drink your wine.
Uh, Latour '57.

39:07.713 --> 39:11.216
The Latour, sir,
is 400 pounds a bottle.

39:15.521 --> 39:17.523
Then we'll have
two bottles.

39:21.359 --> 39:22.661
There. You count it.

39:28.266 --> 39:32.738
All these little tubes
and microbes and things.

39:32.771 --> 39:33.905
Molecules?

39:33.939 --> 39:36.007
Those, too.
Even better.
(LAUGHS)

39:36.041 --> 39:37.809
Can I tell you
something?

39:38.777 --> 39:41.379
What? You must.
Everything.

39:41.413 --> 39:42.748
(WHISPERING)
It's a secret.

39:43.449 --> 39:44.783
What is it?

39:46.718 --> 39:47.886
I'm done.

to the forgotten
sensation of warmth

as millions of gallons
of heating oil flowed
from a storage depot

Oh, yes.
Which he may well do.

01:46:39.894 --> 01:46:42.764

01:46:42.797 --> 01:46:45.800
then I'd say
you've made it,

01:46:45.833 --> 01:46:47.935

you'll understand.

I have to do this morning.

01:46:52.039 --> 01:46:55.176
You see, I'm going
to give cold fusion
to the world.

01:46:55.209 --> 01:46:57.912
It's the only way,
if we're ever
together again,

01:46:57.945 --> 01:46:59.346
that I'll know
it's for you,

01:46:59.380 --> 01:47:01.048
and you'll know
it's for me.

01:47:01.649 --> 01:47:03.751
If cold fusion is free,

01:47:03.785 --> 01:47:05.953
then you and I, Simon,
will be free, too.

01:47:07.054 --> 01:47:08.556
Listen, if you think

01:47:08.590 --> 01:47:09.991
giving away everything
in front of the world,

01:47:10.024 --> 01:47:12.293
preventing us
from making
an unimaginable fortune

01:47:12.326 --> 01:47:14.295
will accomplish
anything...

01:47:15.497 --> 01:47:16.664

doing here?

There are...
There are police.

01:47:23.705 --> 01:47:25.072
They're everywhere.

01:47:25.106 --> 01:47:26.841
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

01:48:57.632 --> 01:48:58.866
No.

01:48:58.900 --> 01:49:02.103
Well, we all know
that cold fusion
has had a...

01:49:03.504 --> 01:49:05.372
A difficult childhood.

01:49:06.608 --> 01:49:08.576
Those of us
in the field
are orphans.

01:49:09.143 --> 01:49:11.145
Bastards, at best.

01:49:11.178 --> 01:49:15.082
But difficult childhoods,
I believe, make the most
interesting adults.

01:49:18.119 --> 01:49:20.254
And I know that
most of you thought
that cold fusion

01:49:20.287 --> 01:49:22.657
was an impossible dream.
I'm her biggest fan.

01:49:22.690 --> 01:49:24.692
EMMA: Cold fusion
belongs to all of us.
I think she's a fox.

01:49:25.192 --> 01:49:26.828
Look at that.

01:49:26.861 --> 01:49:29.163
EMMA: Even though some
of you may feel that
its practical application

01:49:29.196 --> 01:49:32.466
is still somewhat
speculative,

01:49:32.499 --> 01:49:36.638
well, I've come here
today to share with you
how that dream is slowly

01:49:36.671 --> 01:49:38.272
becoming a reality.

01:49:38.305 --> 01:49:41.308
Yes, it may take years
to finally learn

01:49:41.342 --> 01:49:42.977
how to harness this energy
Oh, look at the time.
Got to go.

and stabilize its power.

we can all work

01:51:30.918 --> 01:51:34.155
* Sure as silence
follows rain

01:51:34.188 --> 01:51:37.324
* The taste of you
upon my lips

01:51:37.358 --> 01:51:39.727
* The fingers
in my brain

01:51:39.761 --> 01:51:42.029
* Ever gentle

01:51:42.063 --> 01:51:46.033
* As it kills me
where I lay

01:51:46.067 --> 01:51:48.402
* Who am I
to resist?

01:51:48.435 --> 01:51:51.238
* Who are you to fail?

01:51:51.272 --> 01:51:55.076
* Got to get you
out of my mind

01:51:56.410 --> 01:52:00.815
* But I can't escape
from the feeling

01:52:00.848 --> 01:52:05.386
* As I try to leave
the memory behind

01:52:07.521 --> 01:52:12.126
* Without you,
what's there
to believe in?

01:52:24.238 --> 01:52:27.041
* Could be so sorry

01:52:27.074 --> 01:52:30.044
* For the way it had to go

01:52:30.077 --> 01:52:35.349
* But now I feel your presence
in a way I could not know

01:52:35.382 --> 01:52:41.322
* And I wonder,
do you ever feel the same?

01:52:41.355 --> 01:52:45.759
* In whispering darkness,
do you ever hear my name?

01:52:46.727 --> 01:52:50.531
* Got to get you
out of my mind

01:52:52.166 --> 01:52:56.403
* But I can't escape
from the feeling

01:52:56.437 --> 01:53:00.975
* As I try to leave
the memory behind

01:53:03.544 --> 01:53:07.381
* Without you
what's left to believe in?

01:53:35.109 --> 01:53:36.743
* How could you dare?

01:53:38.045 --> 01:53:39.613
* To become so real

01:53:40.882 --> 01:53:43.084
* When you're just
a ghost in me

01:53:46.687 --> 01:53:51.092
* And I've got to
get you out of my mind

01:53:53.227 --> 01:53:57.764
* But I can't escape
from the feeling

01:53:57.798 --> 01:54:01.668
* As I try
to leave the memory behind

01:54:04.505 --> 01:54:08.542
* Without you
what's left to believe in?

01:54:15.782 --> 01:54:19.220
* Here in the back
of my mind *
