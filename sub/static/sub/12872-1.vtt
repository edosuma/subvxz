03:11.500 --> 03:15.495
I'm tellin' you for the 157th time,
turn that damned music off!

03:15.566 --> 03:19.691
It's singeing my hair!
You got to find your sneakers, buddy.

03:20.452 --> 03:21.691
Your old ones!

03:21.788 --> 03:24.604
Hey! See if you can
find Dad's sneakers!

03:25.217 --> 03:27.454
Dad? Come on, Mom.

03:28.949 --> 03:30.389
Why bother?

03:30.390 --> 03:32.399
He's just gonna cancel.

03:33.055 --> 03:37.028
- Dad always cancels.
- Somethin' came up those other times.

03:37.029 --> 03:39.069
I have a stomachache
in my mouth.

03:39.141 --> 03:40.997
- Oh, God.
- You do?

03:41.062 --> 03:44.836
Here we go. She pretends she's sick
so we don't leave her.

03:44.901 --> 03:47.237
Oh, stop.
It's just for a few days.

03:47.303 --> 03:50.239
With those notorious psychos,
your grandparents!

03:52.553 --> 03:54.921
Oh. Whoop, whoop, whoop.

03:54.986 --> 03:59.623
I almost got you packed.
Hi. I just can't find...

03:59.690 --> 04:02.147
your old sneakers.

04:02.220 --> 04:05.385
Um, can I talk to you
for a second?

04:08.941 --> 04:12.293
Oh, you're not gonna do this,
not three years in a row.

04:12.367 --> 04:15.401
Roarke, you take your sister
in the other room.

04:15.471 --> 04:17.959
- Come on, Willa.
- And shut the door.

04:18.031 --> 04:21.962
- Don't make this harder than it is.
- What are we to you, Tom?

04:22.034 --> 04:26.508
Are we just some gaggle of obligations
pulling on you, making you tired?

04:26.579 --> 04:30.443
Gail, Selvaggio didn't like my drawings.
They just weren't good enough.

04:30.515 --> 04:34.446
- They're giving the project to Parker.
- So let Parker do it.

04:34.518 --> 04:37.715
Fine, so let Parker do it.
Maggie, get off the quilt.

04:37.783 --> 04:39.888
Maggie!

04:39.959 --> 04:42.610
Get off the quilt!

04:42.679 --> 04:44.917
Maggie, get down.

04:44.985 --> 04:46.840
Good girl.

04:46.905 --> 04:49.656
Gail, how did this
become such a big deal?

04:49.722 --> 04:53.978
Oh, it's not as big as
the Selvaggio deal, clearly.

04:54.043 --> 04:56.433
But it is your son's
birthday again...

04:56.508 --> 04:58.746
and he thinks you don't
want to spend time with him.

04:58.813 --> 05:00.919
You understand that part?

05:08.415 --> 05:11.231
I do not treat you
like a baby.

05:11.296 --> 05:15.422
I treat you like a slob.
There's a difference. Oh!

05:17.346 --> 05:19.321
- Hi, Mom.
- Ohh.

05:19.394 --> 05:22.975
Oh, look at you.
It's so good to see you.

05:23.045 --> 05:26.079
- Hey!
- It's good to see you too, Grandpa.

05:26.149 --> 05:28.125
You have to sign, buddy.

05:28.199 --> 05:31.712
Hey! Oh, boy.
Oh, yeah.

05:31.783 --> 05:35.232
- You look good.
- Where's Tom?

05:35.304 --> 05:37.159
- Well...
- He didn't want to come.

05:37.224 --> 05:40.771
No, no. He's working.
He's really busy right now.

05:40.841 --> 05:43.046
Mags!

05:43.114 --> 05:44.969
Maggie!

05:52.268 --> 05:55.881
I think my marriage is over, Mama.

05:55.949 --> 05:57.805
Oh, Bean.

05:57.871 --> 06:00.107
Damn.

06:00.175 --> 06:02.031
Well, he, uh...

06:02.097 --> 06:05.872
just can't seem to make
time for us anymore.

06:05.937 --> 06:09.648
He's let himself get
so beaten up by his job.

06:09.714 --> 06:13.512
He hates it, but he spends
every waking minute over there.

06:13.587 --> 06:16.784
He hasn't been home
one weekend since Christmas.

06:16.852 --> 06:21.044
I don't know what it is
that he's trying to prove...

06:21.110 --> 06:24.013
but I'm really sick
of the whole thing.

06:24.087 --> 06:25.942
I'm sick of the whole fight.

06:26.007 --> 06:29.075
Everything has become
unbelievably hard.

06:29.145 --> 06:33.423
Huh. Honey, forgive me,
but you don't know what hard is.

06:33.498 --> 06:36.498
That's because
you give yourself an out.

06:37.883 --> 06:39.739
In our generation,
we had no out.

06:39.805 --> 06:41.844
That was the pact
of marriage.

06:41.916 --> 06:45.081
Do you think
if I gave myself an out...

06:45.149 --> 06:49.972
with your father, given his
orneriness and his deafness...

06:50.046 --> 06:52.981
that I wouldn't
have taken it years ago?

06:58.114 --> 06:59.969
Mom.

07:10.533 --> 07:12.956
Here, let me take that one.

07:13.029 --> 07:14.884
- Roarke.
- Yeah.

07:14.951 --> 07:19.424
- Go buy me a map and get the tags.
- Okay.

07:19.495 --> 07:23.839
The ranger said I had to get tags.
I thought this was all I needed.

07:23.913 --> 07:27.297
This just confirms
your reservation.

07:27.371 --> 07:30.470
There you go.
Here's your three tags.

07:30.539 --> 07:32.394
If a ranger asks,
show them to him.

07:32.459 --> 07:36.771
- Can I buy those two first-aid kits?
- Sure. Make it 50 bucks even.

07:36.845 --> 07:38.918
Some of the Band-Aids are missing.

07:38.990 --> 07:42.732
- Guy tore his ear up on a fishhook.
- Ouch.

07:42.797 --> 07:45.516
Thank you very much.

07:48.817 --> 07:51.152
Here.
And could I have a map?

07:57.235 --> 07:59.855
I wish you were too, Pop.

07:59.925 --> 08:04.780
Remember the trip down
the Snake River when I was twelve?

08:06.391 --> 08:08.333
That was the greatest.

08:10.711 --> 08:13.079
Thanks.

08:15.256 --> 08:18.071
Whoa, there, partner.
Are you okay?

08:18.136 --> 08:19.993
Yeah, I just got
to get new feet.

08:20.058 --> 08:22.425
Until you do,
you better slow on down.

08:22.490 --> 08:25.591
- You went to that concert?
- What?

08:25.660 --> 08:28.343
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

08:28.413 --> 08:30.748
- Great show.
- So you saw Jane's Addiction.

08:30.813 --> 08:33.049
Wish I could've seen them
before they broke up.

08:33.118 --> 08:36.828
- Uh-huh.
- So, you goin' down the river alone?

08:36.895 --> 08:39.067
No. Me and a couple
of my buddies.

08:39.135 --> 08:41.788
- Who are you goin' with?
- My mom.

08:41.857 --> 08:44.279
Oh, yeah?
This is a pretty tough river.

08:44.353 --> 08:46.209
She used to be a guide here.

08:46.274 --> 08:48.957
She wants me to go down the river
before it gets polluted.

08:49.027 --> 08:50.588
What about your daddy?

08:50.660 --> 08:54.490
He had to stay home and
do one of his stupid drawings.

08:54.564 --> 08:56.932
Too bad.

08:56.997 --> 09:00.096
Is that your mom?

09:00.166 --> 09:03.014
Yeah.

09:03.078 --> 09:04.989
I'm Wade.
What's your name?

09:05.063 --> 09:06.918
- Roarke.
- Good to meet you, Roarke.

09:06.984 --> 09:09.287
Mom! Mom!
This is Wade.

09:09.353 --> 09:12.518
- He's goin' down the river too.
- Hi, Wade. I'm Gail.

09:12.586 --> 09:14.921
Great idea, showing Roarke the river
before they ruin it.

09:17.100 --> 09:19.009
Wade!

09:19.083 --> 09:22.979
- Come on! We gotta go!
- Be right there.

09:23.053 --> 09:25.902
He tells me you used
to be a guide here.

09:25.966 --> 09:28.138
Oh! About 150 years ago.

09:28.207 --> 09:30.444
You must know the river
pretty well, then.

09:30.511 --> 09:33.327
- Well, I used to.
- How far you going?

09:33.392 --> 09:35.247
End of the line, Bridal Creek.

09:35.312 --> 09:37.169
Oh, yeah? Us too.

09:37.234 --> 09:40.267
- Oh, great.
- Come on, Wade! We're dyin' here!

09:40.338 --> 09:43.635
I wish I were going with you guys.

09:47.380 --> 09:49.421
Well.

09:49.494 --> 09:51.348
Here you go, Roarke.

09:51.413 --> 09:53.323
Keep the sun
out of your eyes.

09:53.398 --> 09:56.465
Wow! No way!

09:56.535 --> 09:59.634
- What do you say, Roarke?
- Oh, yeah. Thanks.

09:59.704 --> 10:03.153
Well, uh, see you
on the river, I guess.

10:03.225 --> 10:05.265
I don't know.
We're gonna be goin' fast.

10:05.337 --> 10:08.087
- Let's go, Wade!
- I'm comin'. I'm comin'.

10:09.110 --> 10:11.446
I said the right oar!

10:11.512 --> 10:14.644
- Okay, the right one!
- Yeah! Take it!

10:14.712 --> 10:16.600
Get off my damn foot!

10:16.666 --> 10:19.122
It'll be a long haul
with him at the oars.

10:19.195 --> 10:21.464
Guy in back
knows what he's doing.

10:21.530 --> 10:23.987
Frank used to be
a guide on the Colorado.

10:24.060 --> 10:26.482
- Push with both oars!
- It's Dad!

10:26.555 --> 10:28.891
Daddy!

10:28.957 --> 10:33.879
Is this where you sign up
for river rafting lessons?

10:35.520 --> 10:38.716
I got a dry jacket
and a pair of reef walkers.

10:38.784 --> 10:42.167
The guy at the camping store
said that's all I'll need.

10:42.241 --> 10:44.795
What happened to Mr. Selvaggio?

10:44.866 --> 10:46.721
I brought him with me.

10:46.787 --> 10:50.617
Let's go boys.
One... two... three.

10:50.691 --> 10:53.114
Let's do it!
Jump on!

10:53.188 --> 10:57.248
- Bye-bye, Mommy!
- See you at Bridal Creek!

10:57.317 --> 10:59.554
Whoa!

10:59.622 --> 11:02.044
Whoa! That's it!

11:02.118 --> 11:05.731
I love you too!

11:25.390 --> 11:27.278
Roarke.

11:28.302 --> 11:30.506
Roarke.

11:31.568 --> 11:33.095
Roarke!

11:42.163 --> 11:44.498
It's beautiful.

11:44.565 --> 11:46.801
- Yeah.
- Really.

12:02.521 --> 12:06.297
Okay, sweetie,
put your helmet on, please.

12:06.362 --> 12:08.118
Mom.

12:08.187 --> 12:11.767
You don't have to wear it all the time,
but we got some rapids comin' up here.

12:13.660 --> 12:17.142
- Just give me a hand, damn it!
- It's coming up!

12:19.262 --> 12:21.118
You all right?

12:21.183 --> 12:24.086
If you're gonna sit there in the back...

12:24.160 --> 12:26.975
you should sit on
the floor in the center.

12:27.040 --> 12:30.074
- I can't see from there.
- Well, then, sit in front.

12:30.145 --> 12:32.034
I like it here.

12:32.098 --> 12:34.400
Okay.

12:35.875 --> 12:38.242
Here we go!

12:38.308 --> 12:40.349
Woo-hoo! Heh!

12:40.422 --> 12:43.324
Wow, this is great!

12:46.631 --> 12:49.479
Yes! Hold on, Maggie!

12:51.655 --> 12:56.480
Look out for that rock!

13:03.243 --> 13:05.098
Ohh!

13:05.164 --> 13:07.685
Whoa!

13:08.877 --> 13:12.523
That was great!
But where's Dad?

13:12.591 --> 13:14.925
He's swimming.

13:17.167 --> 13:20.299
- Point your feet down!
- Point your toes, Dad!

13:20.368 --> 13:24.265
Could you just stop laughing
for a second and help me into the boat?

13:26.547 --> 13:28.369
- Ohh!
- Oh!

13:30.612 --> 13:33.482
Is this the biggest one, Mom?

13:33.556 --> 13:35.412
The biggest one's
the Gauntlet.

13:35.478 --> 13:37.332
That's a five-plus.

13:37.398 --> 13:39.733
That's off the scale.

13:39.799 --> 13:43.378
- When do we do that one?
- Well, we don't do that one.

13:43.447 --> 13:46.296
That's after the take-out
at Bridal Creek.

13:46.362 --> 13:49.427
- You can't go down there.
- Have you ever done it?

13:49.497 --> 13:52.815
- Mom is saying it's too dangerous.
- For you, maybe.

13:52.891 --> 13:55.706
Roarke. Honey,
I went down the Gauntlet...

13:55.771 --> 13:59.385
when I was 18 years old
with two other guides...

13:59.453 --> 14:01.308
experienced guides.

14:01.373 --> 14:03.862
And we were just lucky.

14:03.933 --> 14:07.710
But there were two other people
that summer who did not get so lucky.

14:07.775 --> 14:12.086
One guy got killed,
and the other one is paralyzed for life.

14:12.161 --> 14:16.569
Don't worry. We're gonna hit
some threes and some four-pluses...

14:16.642 --> 14:20.386
and we will risk death
a number of times on this trip.

14:20.451 --> 14:23.649
So you're gonna scream,
you're gonna be so happy.

14:25.316 --> 14:28.830
- Hey, look, Mom, there's Wade!
- Hello, the shore!

14:28.901 --> 14:31.936
- Hello, the boat!
- Is everybody okay?

14:32.007 --> 14:35.041
- Yeah, I just got a cramp!
- We're trying to work it out.

14:35.111 --> 14:37.631
Hey, who's your friend, Gail?

14:37.703 --> 14:41.502
Oh, this is Tom,
uh, Roarke's father.

14:41.577 --> 14:45.288
Oh, no. You didn't tell him
about us, did you?

14:45.355 --> 14:47.297
No.

14:47.372 --> 14:51.628
Hey, Roarke!
Don't tell those fish we're comin'!

14:53.773 --> 14:57.549
All right,
let's bring a little line in, okay?

14:57.614 --> 15:00.582
We're gonna aim for that ripple
right over there. See?

15:00.654 --> 15:02.630
Ten, two, ten, two...

15:02.703 --> 15:04.558
ten, release!

15:04.623 --> 15:06.185
Then let go of your line.

15:06.257 --> 15:10.033
Why don't you ask your dad
if he wants to come over?

15:10.098 --> 15:13.295
Hey, Dad, you wanna try this?

15:13.362 --> 15:15.402
Not now!
Thanks, buddy!

15:15.475 --> 15:18.990
Do you think
he even knows he left Boston?

15:19.061 --> 15:21.397
Yeah, he knows.

15:21.462 --> 15:26.100
But he took two planes
and a charter just to get here, so...

15:26.166 --> 15:28.023
let's give him a break.

15:28.088 --> 15:32.018
- Try it again.
- Why are you suddenly on his side?

15:32.090 --> 15:34.906
I'm on everybody's side.
I'm the mother.

15:34.970 --> 15:37.336
- You got it! That's it!
- Look, Mom!

15:37.401 --> 15:40.720
You got a nice one, buddy.
He's a beauty.

15:40.796 --> 15:42.651
Let's get him.
There he is.

15:42.716 --> 15:44.572
Come here.
Come here, sweetheart.

15:44.637 --> 15:48.380
Look, Daddy.
Oh, it's a monster.

15:48.445 --> 15:50.812
You know,
this is the first time...

15:50.877 --> 15:54.327
we've all had dinner together
since Mom's birthday.

15:57.857 --> 16:01.468
Hello, the Gail, Roarke
and Tom family!

16:01.536 --> 16:03.959
This is the Wade raft
passing you by!

16:04.034 --> 16:07.101
Hey, Wade!
I caught two fish today!

16:07.171 --> 16:09.278
First time I ever fished!

16:09.349 --> 16:11.291
Must be that lucky hat!

16:11.365 --> 16:16.963
Hey, Roarke, if that hat's so lucky,
I want it back!

16:32.011 --> 16:34.695
Hi.

16:34.764 --> 16:37.732
- He's down.
- Mm-hmm.

16:37.804 --> 16:40.708
Well, had a big day.

16:44.623 --> 16:47.274
It's kind of warm.

16:49.233 --> 16:51.175
That's the way I like it.

16:57.811 --> 17:01.456
Did you finish
your sketches yet?

17:04.340 --> 17:06.446
No. No, I didn't.

17:06.518 --> 17:08.723
And it's not a sketch, Gail.

17:08.790 --> 17:12.106
- You know, it's very important.
- Very important, I know.

17:12.182 --> 17:14.039
- So, tomorrow...
- What?

17:14.104 --> 17:17.750
Could you just pretend
to like it here a little bit?

17:17.817 --> 17:20.152
For Roarke's sake,
if not for mine.

17:20.218 --> 17:24.954
I don't do too bad at pretending
to like your stuff, so...

17:27.900 --> 17:31.350
Is that what you do?
Pretend to like my stuff?

17:31.422 --> 17:35.196
- No. You know, that's not what I mean.
- You don't have to.

17:35.261 --> 17:39.289
And just don't.
And don't do me any favors, either.

17:39.360 --> 17:42.044
I don't.

17:43.937 --> 17:45.792
I won't.

17:50.339 --> 17:52.194
Gail.

17:52.259 --> 17:56.124
- Listen, don't you ever realize...
- Let's just stop, okay?

17:56.197 --> 17:58.337
You never...
Oh, please!

18:05.479 --> 18:08.993
Whoa, it's cold!

18:09.064 --> 18:10.887
Whoo!

18:20.205 --> 18:22.593
Wow!

18:23.628 --> 18:27.241
Hey, look, Mom!
Graffiti!

18:27.309 --> 18:29.448
Oh, wow!

18:29.518 --> 18:32.781
Those are pictographs.
They were made by people...

18:32.848 --> 18:35.849
who lived here thousands of years
before white men came.

18:35.920 --> 18:37.864
So those are their hands?

18:37.938 --> 18:40.556
Those markings might've been
made by a boy your age...

18:40.626 --> 18:43.016
while he was
on his vision quest.

18:43.091 --> 18:45.711
See?

18:46.836 --> 18:50.132
Are you sure there's
fish around here, Mom?

18:51.349 --> 18:53.903
Over there, honey.

18:55.958 --> 18:57.814
Right in the current.

18:57.879 --> 19:00.267
Hey there!

19:02.872 --> 19:04.728
We've been waitin' for you.

19:04.793 --> 19:08.591
I should've suspected something
when he had us camp at the walk-out.

19:08.667 --> 19:11.482
Frank and Terry'd been
arguing most of the day.

19:11.547 --> 19:14.363
Frank used to be married
to my sister...

19:14.428 --> 19:16.283
until she realized
what a butthole he was.

19:16.349 --> 19:19.165
Anyway, Frank said things
he shouldn't have said.

19:19.230 --> 19:22.045
And this morning,
we woke up and he was gone.

19:22.110 --> 19:25.013
Why didn't you guys just follow him out,
walk out with him?

19:25.087 --> 19:27.871
That would have been
the smart thing to do...

19:27.937 --> 19:30.239
but I didn't want
to give him the satisfaction.

19:30.305 --> 19:33.155
And what he was doin' with the oars
didn't look that hard...

19:33.219 --> 19:37.311
so we just headed downriver...
and we saw this.

19:37.380 --> 19:40.195
That's when we decided
to wait for you guys.

19:40.260 --> 19:43.709
- Wade said you used to be a guide here.
- Yeah. Roarke, come over here.

19:43.781 --> 19:47.098
Is there any way
we could walk out of here...

19:47.174 --> 19:50.437
- like go up the canyon and...
- Uh, well, you might...

19:50.503 --> 19:53.820
but once you got up
to that canyon rim...

19:53.896 --> 19:57.378
and headed back to the ranger station,
there's a huge gorge.

19:57.450 --> 19:59.970
You'd have to walk around it.

20:00.041 --> 20:03.621
Even if you had the equipment
and knew what you were doing...

20:03.691 --> 20:07.238
and where you were going,
it'd take you five or six days.

20:10.221 --> 20:12.939
Looks like we're stuck.

20:13.006 --> 20:14.861
Well, we...

20:14.926 --> 20:19.019
- I could get you as far as Bridal Creek.
- Yeah.

20:20.144 --> 20:23.691
We... wouldn't want
to be a burden.

20:24.753 --> 20:26.892
Well...

20:26.962 --> 20:30.445
it doesn't look
like you have much choice.

20:30.515 --> 20:33.036
All right.

20:33.108 --> 20:35.978
Anyway, it's not as bad as it looks.

20:36.053 --> 20:39.054
- You just got to stay to the right.
- Maggie!

20:39.126 --> 20:41.843
There's a bad hole on the left.
Don't hit that.

20:41.910 --> 20:42.893
No.

20:42.967 --> 20:45.356
Come on, Mags! Time to go!

20:45.431 --> 20:49.207
Honey, would you go up
and get her?

20:49.273 --> 20:53.682
Stay to the right, and if you
do go swimming, which you won't...

20:53.755 --> 20:57.617
point your feet downstream
and hold on to your jacket.

20:57.691 --> 20:59.863
Just let
the current take you.

20:59.932 --> 21:02.266
Don't command the river.
Let the river command you.

21:02.332 --> 21:06.360
Hey, I don't live my life like that,
and I don't think you do, either.

21:08.288 --> 21:10.142
Maggie!

21:10.207 --> 21:12.347
Maggie! Come!

21:12.416 --> 21:14.555
Come on, girl!

21:14.625 --> 21:18.106
Maggie!

21:18.177 --> 21:20.121
Maggie, come.

21:21.859 --> 21:23.899
What do you got there, girl?

21:23.971 --> 21:28.163
You all right, girl?

21:28.227 --> 21:30.716
Maggie, come!

21:30.789 --> 21:33.693
Come, Maggie!

21:39.751 --> 21:42.174
Dogs.

21:42.249 --> 21:44.704
Yeah.

21:50.962 --> 21:55.153
- Buckle your life jacket. Stay right.
- All right.

21:55.220 --> 21:57.075
- Just relax.
- Relax, huh?

21:57.140 --> 21:59.824
Yeah. Relax.

21:59.893 --> 22:03.636
- I want you to be the best you can be.
- Best I can be.

22:03.702 --> 22:07.829
Let me get down there first.
I'll be waitin' for ya.

22:07.897 --> 22:10.929
All right!
Come on, Maggie! Here we go!

22:11.000 --> 22:12.855
Tom, better put the map away.

22:12.921 --> 22:15.738
We're gonna go through
our first whoop-dee-doos.

22:15.803 --> 22:19.186
- You might want to take a secure seat.
- What?

22:19.259 --> 22:22.325
- Here we go!
- Hold on, Roarke!

22:32.702 --> 22:35.965
Here we go!

22:48.163 --> 22:50.465
- Oh, great!
- Oh, boy.

22:54.437 --> 22:56.293
All right.

22:56.358 --> 22:58.530
Here we go.

23:03.272 --> 23:06.689
She said stay on the right,
remember?

23:06.761 --> 23:09.031
- You remember, right?
- Oh, man.

23:09.098 --> 23:11.238
She wasn't playing around.

23:12.747 --> 23:15.137
Whoo!

23:17.037 --> 23:18.892
Go right!

23:20.333 --> 23:23.946
Get us over, Wade!
Oh, shit!

23:24.015 --> 23:26.252
Oh, my God.

23:26.319 --> 23:30.029
- The right, Wade! To the right!
- Shut up!

23:32.592 --> 23:35.890
Oh, my God!
They're on the wrong side!

23:35.955 --> 23:38.705
Get over!
You gotta turn!

23:38.771 --> 23:42.799
There's a rock here!

23:42.868 --> 23:45.073
Wade!

23:59.769 --> 24:01.908
Get in the front!
We're gonna pick 'em up!

24:05.916 --> 24:07.857
Wade's lost his jacket!

24:12.798 --> 24:16.793
Wade can't swim!
He's back there! He can't swim!

24:16.863 --> 24:19.612
Pull him in!
Pull him in!

24:19.680 --> 24:22.169
Get in the back.
We're goin' to him!

24:22.240 --> 24:24.478
There he is!

24:26.946 --> 24:29.915
Wade! Hold on, buddy!

24:29.988 --> 24:31.896
Wade!

24:31.970 --> 24:33.826
He went under!

24:33.891 --> 24:35.583
Wade!

24:35.653 --> 24:38.588
Where is he?

24:38.661 --> 24:40.964
He's still under!

24:41.030 --> 24:43.419
- Get the throw bag, Roarke!
- Hold on, Wade!

24:59.852 --> 25:02.722
Right there!

25:21.074 --> 25:23.442
Here's the rope! Over here!

25:23.507 --> 25:26.410
- You okay?
- Wow, Dad!

25:26.484 --> 25:29.747
Come on, man. We got ya.

25:29.813 --> 25:31.852
- Tom!
- Hey, Wade!

25:31.924 --> 25:35.243
You almost drown!

25:35.319 --> 25:39.150
Wow! One of these days
I have got to learn how to swim.

25:42.010 --> 25:44.246
You okay? Nice job.

25:44.313 --> 25:47.064
I'm okay.

25:51.900 --> 25:54.802
Oh, I got that.
I got it.

25:54.876 --> 25:57.976
Okay.

26:01.630 --> 26:04.927
I want to thank you, Tom.
You saved my life.

26:04.992 --> 26:07.162
Oh, don't worry about it.

26:07.231 --> 26:09.786
You didn't have
to hit me, though.

26:12.578 --> 26:14.434
Yes, I did.

26:25.062 --> 26:28.260
Just turn it around.
Get it straight up and down.

26:28.327 --> 26:30.182
- Pull out some.
- All right.

26:30.247 --> 26:33.892
Point that thumb
where you want the fly to go.

26:33.960 --> 26:36.066
Ten and two and release.

26:36.137 --> 26:37.992
At the top of the news:

26:38.058 --> 26:40.776
The car believed to have been used in
the robbery of the livestock auction...

26:40.843 --> 26:43.593
at the Flathead County Fairgrounds
Sunday was found abandoned...

26:43.659 --> 26:45.897
on a back road
near the Canadian border...

26:45.964 --> 26:49.259
in the robbery that netted
nearly a quarter of a million dollars.

26:49.326 --> 26:53.101
- A security guard was killed.
- What? What'd I do?

26:53.166 --> 26:56.582
My dad's been telling
my mother for 30 years...

26:56.655 --> 26:59.852
that they're going to rob
this cattle auction.

26:59.919 --> 27:02.310
- And finally somebody did it.
- Cattle auction?

27:02.384 --> 27:05.353
He's gonna be very happy.
Yeah, on the radio.

27:05.426 --> 27:07.281
- They just...
- Wow.

27:07.346 --> 27:10.827
You guys known each other
a long time?

27:10.899 --> 27:13.583
Me and Wade go way back.

27:13.651 --> 27:15.824
We just met Frank in Tulsa.

27:15.893 --> 27:19.156
L... I thought Frank
was married to your sister.

27:19.221 --> 27:23.663
- Oh, yeah. She lives in Tulsa.
- Oh.

27:23.735 --> 27:27.085
So what do you do when you're not
trying to drown yourself on a river?

27:27.160 --> 27:30.195
- I'm a skier, ski bum.
- Oh, yeah?

27:31.674 --> 27:33.681
What about you?
What do you do?

27:33.754 --> 27:37.946
I teach history
for a school for the deaf.

27:38.011 --> 27:41.112
Tom is an architect.

27:41.182 --> 27:44.029
I could tell you were a teacher.

27:44.093 --> 27:46.002
- Little bossy?
- No, no.

27:46.077 --> 27:49.243
- Ladies sure do like Wade.
- Yeah?

27:49.312 --> 27:51.134
Let's try again.

27:51.199 --> 27:54.615
- Ten, two, ten, two.
- Yeah, sure do.

27:54.688 --> 27:56.760
You keep trying to bring
your left hand up.

28:00.387 --> 28:02.242
Hey, Tom.

28:11.269 --> 28:13.637
I don't like those guys.

28:13.703 --> 28:15.973
I think we should leave
them behind tomorrow.

28:16.040 --> 28:19.138
They're all right.
They're just those kind of guys...

28:19.207 --> 28:22.208
that just never
got over their adolescence.

28:22.281 --> 28:24.137
There's lots of them up here.

28:24.202 --> 28:26.986
Why are you defending him?

28:28.332 --> 28:32.488
Who? Wade?

28:32.556 --> 28:35.045
- I'm not defending him.
- Yes, you are.

28:35.117 --> 28:38.599
You sound like you're jealous.

28:38.669 --> 28:41.059
I'm not jealous...

28:41.134 --> 28:43.687
even though you did
drape yourself all over him.

28:43.759 --> 28:47.209
I did not drape myself.

28:47.281 --> 28:50.478
That is the way you teach
somebody to fly cast, honey.

28:50.545 --> 28:52.881
Oh, Gail. He knew exactly
what he was doing.

28:52.947 --> 28:57.650
Well, you know, they did get in over
their heads and they lost their guide.

28:57.715 --> 29:01.131
If something happened to me, and you
and Roarke were alone on the river...

29:01.204 --> 29:03.114
I would want somebody
to help you.

29:03.189 --> 29:05.458
I'm sorry.
Maybe I am being a jerk about Wade.

29:05.525 --> 29:10.066
But that still doesn't change
that I just think... something's off.

29:11.767 --> 29:13.656
Go get it, Maggie.

29:16.155 --> 29:18.096
Bring it here. Come on.

29:18.170 --> 29:22.645
Good girl, good girl.

29:22.716 --> 29:25.880
Go get it, Maggie.

29:27.934 --> 29:31.960
- Hey, Gail.
- Hey.

29:32.029 --> 29:36.504
- I found a hot spring.
- Yeah, isn't it great?

29:36.576 --> 29:40.603
If you feel the water down here,
it's really warm.

29:40.672 --> 29:44.536
- Oh, man. People.
- Go get it, Maggie.

29:44.611 --> 29:47.578
- Yeah.
- Good, good girl.

29:47.650 --> 29:50.816
Listen, I was wonderin', uh...

29:50.884 --> 29:53.251
What's the river like
below Bridle Creek?

29:53.316 --> 29:57.059
Oh, it's really spectacular down there.
It's unbelievable.

29:57.125 --> 29:59.167
Then how come people
don't go down there?

29:59.238 --> 30:01.891
Well, you're not allowed
to take rafts down there anymore.

30:01.960 --> 30:05.636
It's just... Rapids are unrunnable.
It's treacherous.

30:05.704 --> 30:07.876
I bet you ran it though,
didn't you?

30:07.945 --> 30:11.459
I did. I did.

30:11.530 --> 30:15.177
I was 18 and completely insane.

30:15.244 --> 30:19.204
I bet you'd like to do it again, right?

30:19.277 --> 30:23.074
Hmm, no.

30:23.149 --> 30:25.736
No, everything's different now.
I have kids and...

30:25.806 --> 30:30.542
- And a husband.
- Yeah, and a husband.

30:30.607 --> 30:32.998
And what if you didn't?

30:35.698 --> 30:37.554
But I do.

30:40.370 --> 30:44.049
Go get it, Maggie.

30:44.116 --> 30:46.670
Hey, Ro! I got another one
for your collection.

30:46.740 --> 30:49.477
- Hi, Wade!
- Hey, buddy.

30:49.604 --> 30:54.078
But I got the cigarettes too, so we had
ten cartons of cigarettes and no beer.

30:54.149 --> 30:58.723
I couldn't believe it.

30:58.791 --> 31:01.574
Maggie.
Maggie, no!

31:01.641 --> 31:04.706
Maggie, no!

31:04.776 --> 31:07.811
Maggie, no.
Go lie down. Good girl.

31:07.881 --> 31:13.448
So, Mom, what's this vision quest
thing you told me about?

31:14.603 --> 31:17.386
Vision quest is, um...

31:17.452 --> 31:20.169
is when a boy or a girl
your age...

31:20.237 --> 31:22.180
from one of the tribes
that used to live around here...

31:22.254 --> 31:25.571
would go off for about
four or five days...

31:25.648 --> 31:29.095
all alone without
food or anything...

31:29.167 --> 31:33.926
and they'd go to one of their
sacred places, like where we were.

31:34.002 --> 31:37.233
They'd wait there for a vision
of their guardian spirit...

31:37.299 --> 31:39.949
to appear to them.

31:40.019 --> 31:42.191
They believed that
that guardian spirit would then...

31:42.259 --> 31:46.059
watch over them and
protect them all their lives.

31:49.494 --> 31:54.067
If you'd had a successful vision quest,
you'd do two things.

31:54.136 --> 31:56.591
First, you'd send up
a smoke signal.

31:56.664 --> 31:59.316
Smoke signal.

31:59.385 --> 32:03.161
Yeah. That's so your folks
would know you're okay.

32:03.226 --> 32:07.318
And then draw an image on the rocks
just like the ones we saw today.

32:14.783 --> 32:16.921
I'll be right back.

32:23.585 --> 32:27.720
Happy birthday to you.

32:28.742 --> 32:34.115
Happy birthday to you.

32:34.116 --> 32:39.355
Happy birthday
dear Roarke.

32:39.428 --> 32:44.286
Happy birthday to you.

32:45.704 --> 32:48.421
- Did you think we forgot?
- Yeah.

32:48.488 --> 32:51.391
It's from your dad and me.

32:51.465 --> 32:55.492
- Mom! Hey, look, guys, rollerblades!
- Are those the right ones?

32:55.562 --> 32:58.433
- Promise me you won't break your leg.
- Nope.

32:58.508 --> 33:00.418
And this is from
your baby sister.

33:00.492 --> 33:03.787
It's a... plastic camera.

33:03.852 --> 33:05.708
- It's a waterproof camera.
- Roarke.

33:07.407 --> 33:10.254
- This is from Maggie.
- Yeah, sure.

33:10.319 --> 33:13.484
I think it might be something
you can use on the river.

33:13.552 --> 33:16.138
- Look at it! It's a Swiss army knife!
- Great.

33:16.208 --> 33:19.592
Thanks, Dad!
Look, it's got everything!

33:19.666 --> 33:21.804
- Even the price.
- Yeah.

33:21.873 --> 33:23.882
- How much is it?
- Who wants some cake?

33:23.955 --> 33:25.930
- 79.95.
- Hey, save me a piece!

33:26.004 --> 33:29.867
Hey, Wade.
Look what I got.

33:29.941 --> 33:32.756
Oh, man, that's great.

33:32.821 --> 33:36.849
Terry and I don't have anything
that fancy, but... this is from us.

33:36.919 --> 33:40.466
Gee, uh, thanks, you guys.

33:40.536 --> 33:42.708
This is...

33:43.929 --> 33:45.784
What is it?

33:45.849 --> 33:49.080
- What do ya got there, bud?
- What is it, honey?

33:50.426 --> 33:52.598
It's $200!

33:52.667 --> 33:57.655
Now, that's so in case you want to see
a concert or buy some CDs or whatever.

33:57.725 --> 34:00.629
That's your money.

34:00.703 --> 34:03.669
It's too much money, Wade.
He can't accept that.

34:03.742 --> 34:08.927
Hey, you guys are savin' our lives.
This is our way of showin' appreciation.

34:08.993 --> 34:12.507
- Can I, Dad?
- It's too much money, Roarke.

34:12.578 --> 34:17.280
Thank you very much for the gesture,
but he can't accept it.

34:17.347 --> 34:19.388
- Roarke, give the money back to him.
- No!

34:19.460 --> 34:21.315
- He gave it to me. It's mine.
- Roarke.

34:21.380 --> 34:25.092
Give the money back to him
right now.

34:30.215 --> 34:32.320
What did you say?

34:32.391 --> 34:35.655
I said, you didn't even
want to come on this trip!

34:38.920 --> 34:42.947
Gee. I'm sorry, Tom.
I was just tryin' to be nice.

34:53.934 --> 34:57.197
I talked to him.
He's okay.

34:57.263 --> 34:59.533
You don't have to
beat yourself up over this.

35:01.936 --> 35:04.326
- You know, you did the right thing.
- Oh!

35:04.401 --> 35:08.396
It's very weird that...
Giving him that money.

35:08.466 --> 35:12.526
I pretty much ruined
his birthday party.

35:12.596 --> 35:16.209
Damn it. Same old story.

35:16.277 --> 35:19.791
Want to know what I think?

35:19.862 --> 35:24.785
I think you spend so much time at work
because you don't like being around me.

35:24.855 --> 35:27.954
Gail, it's not about that.

35:29.465 --> 35:32.183
You set such high standards
for yourself.

35:32.250 --> 35:36.507
Everybody around you. I'm just trying
to come up to your expectations of me.

35:36.571 --> 35:39.735
I'm trying to make you
proud of me again.

35:48.159 --> 35:50.777
Oh, God.

35:51.903 --> 35:55.353
Oh, God, I'm sorry...

35:55.425 --> 36:00.412
if I made you feel
you had to do that.

36:00.482 --> 36:03.298
So... what does it mean?

36:05.667 --> 36:07.643
What are we gonna do?

36:11.046 --> 36:14.624
I think there's only
one thing we can do.

36:28.747 --> 36:31.268
Are you making
a pass at me?

36:31.339 --> 36:35.596
I don't know. Is that what it's called
this far outside of Boston?

36:37.391 --> 36:41.668
This far inside
of marriage, you mean.

36:41.743 --> 36:46.796
I think we're sufficiently alienated
for this to qualify...

36:46.864 --> 36:49.253
as a pass.

36:53.394 --> 36:55.250
Mom!

37:02.421 --> 37:04.331
Mom!

37:04.405 --> 37:08.879
- I'm going to put him to sleep.
- Mm-hmm.

37:08.950 --> 37:11.221
And I'll bathe.

37:51.203 --> 37:55.132
It's okay, Maggie.
I'll be out in a minute.

38:27.055 --> 38:31.012
They're so creepy, but I don't
want to make a big deal or scare Roarke.

38:31.140 --> 38:33.824
I just think we have
to get away from them.

38:33.893 --> 38:38.750
Listen, tomorrow, we'll, uh,
act like nothing's happened.

38:38.821 --> 38:42.947
And then we'll just find
a way to leave them behind.

38:43.015 --> 38:45.023
- Okay?
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

38:47.048 --> 38:49.798
Bam! Uppercut right to his jaw.

38:49.865 --> 38:53.478
Teeth went straight through his tongue,
bit it clear off. Blood showered.

38:53.546 --> 38:56.930
It's lyin' on the ground.
Yak-yak-yak-yak! It's still talkin'.

38:57.003 --> 38:59.108
One more bag
and we can go.

38:59.179 --> 39:01.601
- Okay, Roarke. Come on, honey.
- Shut him up, though.

39:01.676 --> 39:04.907
- Hey, give me that.
- Stow your fishing rod. Let's go.

39:04.975 --> 39:07.877
Come on, Maggie!

39:07.951 --> 39:11.848
I don't want to go with you.
I want to spend the day with my friends.

39:11.921 --> 39:17.518
Roarke! You get your little heinie
back here right now.

39:17.585 --> 39:19.725
Oh, I'm sorry.
That's my fault, Gail.

39:19.794 --> 39:22.610
I told him we could practice our fly
fishing together. Ten, two, ten, two.

39:22.676 --> 39:26.352
Wade, you're not experienced enough
to take him down the river.

39:26.419 --> 39:28.362
If we get in trouble,
you're going to be there, right?

39:28.436 --> 39:31.569
This way our music won't bother you!

39:31.638 --> 39:33.132
All right.

39:33.206 --> 39:36.207
Yeah, but, Roarke,
at lunch you come back with us.

39:36.279 --> 39:37.708
What?

39:44.282 --> 39:46.837
Gail, stop looking at them.

39:46.907 --> 39:50.322
Sweetheart, sit down.

39:51.836 --> 39:55.132
Sit down and relax.

39:55.197 --> 39:58.013
Nothing's going to happen.
He's going to have a great time.

39:58.079 --> 40:00.947
He'll listen to his music.
When we stop for lunch, we'll get him.

40:01.022 --> 40:05.464
Then we'll lose them.
Gail, look at me.

40:05.535 --> 40:08.854
Gail, look at me.
Everything's going to be all right.

40:15.715 --> 40:19.492
- Hey, Roarke.
- Yep.

40:19.557 --> 40:22.046
Can you keep a secret?

40:26.150 --> 40:29.185
- Terry, hand me the green bag.
- Wade.

40:30.216 --> 40:32.158
Hand me the green bag.

40:33.322 --> 40:35.177
If I show you something...

40:35.242 --> 40:37.730
- promise not to tell anybody?
- Sure.

40:37.802 --> 40:42.026
- Not even your mom and dad?
- I promise.

40:50.125 --> 40:52.068
Wow.

40:52.142 --> 40:54.182
What are you...

40:57.425 --> 41:00.076
That's right.

41:00.145 --> 41:04.880
First, ya take out the empties.
See that?

41:10.548 --> 41:14.029
Three, five, seven.

41:22.839 --> 41:26.996
In go the new ones.
A full load.

41:30.746 --> 41:33.168
Can I hold it?

41:34.587 --> 41:37.369
I don't think your mom
would like it very much.

41:38.940 --> 41:41.210
My mom wouldn't care.

41:43.037 --> 41:45.657
Really.

41:47.647 --> 41:50.550
- All right.
- They're right there.

41:51.776 --> 41:53.783
Be careful.
It's loaded.

42:06.598 --> 42:08.605
- Bang. Bang.
- Hey!

42:08.678 --> 42:11.459
- Hey.
- Come on, man.

42:11.526 --> 42:14.528
All right, all right.
Better give it back now. Come on.

42:14.600 --> 42:18.725
- Thanks, Wade.
- Hey, what are friends for?

42:23.050 --> 42:25.637
Don't forget. It's our secret.

42:30.956 --> 42:36.195
Hey, what were you
and the guys talkin' about?

42:36.270 --> 42:39.053
- Hmm?
- Things. I'm goin' fishing.

42:39.119 --> 42:42.349
Listen, if you want to catch
anything this time of day...

42:42.415 --> 42:44.521
you're gonna have to go
around that big rock.

42:44.592 --> 42:49.132
There's a little eddy there. There's
some big fish waitin' for ya, honey.

42:50.546 --> 42:53.393
I'll call ya
when lunch is ready.

42:53.459 --> 42:58.675
Take it up to that flat area there.
There's a spring if you want to wash up.

42:58.740 --> 43:01.196
Come on, Maggie.

43:01.269 --> 43:04.466
Be careful on the rocks.
Just stay close to the shore downstream.

43:04.535 --> 43:07.831
- Okay!
- Don't go where I can't see you.

43:10.488 --> 43:12.726
I'll be right back.

43:21.851 --> 43:26.741
Terry?
Help me with this, Terry.

43:26.813 --> 43:29.531
Did you get the drinks, Tom?

43:30.975 --> 43:32.884
No, I didn't.

43:32.958 --> 43:36.025
I'll go get them.

43:36.095 --> 43:38.879
Oh, this looks pretty great.

43:42.434 --> 43:44.322
Oh, boy.

43:48.643 --> 43:52.574
Ah, that's great.
You ought to try it.

44:08.714 --> 44:11.398
I'll get a towel.

44:11.466 --> 44:12.840
Oh!

44:31.730 --> 44:33.868
Wade!

44:36.370 --> 44:38.510
Oh, man!

44:38.579 --> 44:41.165
Wade!

44:49.206 --> 44:51.695
Come on!

44:53.816 --> 44:55.672
Wade!

44:59.293 --> 45:00.120
We're gonna make it.

45:00.282 --> 45:01.577
We're gonna make it.

45:03.706 --> 45:06.872
Roarke. Roarke. Reel it in, honey.
We're gonna find another place.

45:06.940 --> 45:08.795
You said this was
a good place.

45:08.860 --> 45:12.025
- Just reel it in.
- It's stuck.

45:12.093 --> 45:14.777
- Break it, damn it.
- What are you doing?

45:14.845 --> 45:16.700
- I'll explain later. Get in the boat.
- No!

45:16.766 --> 45:19.418
I don't want to ride with you!
I hate you!

45:19.488 --> 45:22.423
- Roarke! Get in the boat!
- What about Maggie?

45:22.496 --> 45:26.165
- Maggie! Maggie!
- Roarke!

45:28.053 --> 45:31.830
- Come on, Maggie. Come on, girl.
- Hey.

45:31.895 --> 45:35.638
What are you guys doin'?

45:37.208 --> 45:40.472
We were just gonna go on ahead
and be by ourselves for a little bit.

45:40.538 --> 45:42.513
Oh.

45:42.587 --> 45:47.409
Yeah. It is our vacation and we haven't
been alone together all that much.

45:47.483 --> 45:49.753
I thought you guys
were runnin' out on us.

45:49.821 --> 45:52.407
No. Uh-uh.

45:55.102 --> 45:58.103
I think that's exactly
what they were doin', Terry.

46:01.375 --> 46:06.561
You're right. We were.
I-It's just not working out between us.

46:06.626 --> 46:11.548
Why's that? Because your son
wants to be with me instead of you?

46:11.619 --> 46:14.205
Roarke. Come here.

46:15.749 --> 46:19.328
Look, I'm taking my family
and we're gonna go down the river alone.

46:19.397 --> 46:21.252
That's what we're gonna do.

46:21.317 --> 46:24.831
I'm sorry.
We'll send somebody back to get you.

46:24.902 --> 46:28.165
Who died and made you stud dick
all of a sudden, Tom?

46:28.233 --> 46:30.601
You go get in
the boat right now.

46:30.665 --> 46:34.112
Wade, rangers come down here
all the time.

46:34.185 --> 46:38.278
You could hook up with one of them
and get to Bridle Creek ahead of us.

46:38.346 --> 46:41.763
And what if I said
I'm not gonna let you go?

46:41.836 --> 46:45.797
What would you do?

46:53.840 --> 46:55.696
What would you do, stud?

46:55.761 --> 46:58.095
- Hey! What is he...
- Just let him talk to him for a second.

46:59.569 --> 47:01.544
- I don't want to fight with you.
- Oh.

47:01.619 --> 47:04.107
Wade!

47:04.178 --> 47:07.628
I tried to be nice to you.

47:07.700 --> 47:10.221
I tried to be nice
to your family.

47:10.292 --> 47:14.068
And what do you do?
You try and run out on me.

47:14.133 --> 47:16.688
I'm drownin', Tom.

47:16.759 --> 47:18.646
You wanna hit me?

47:21.463 --> 47:23.352
I'm pullin' you down, Tom.

47:23.417 --> 47:25.425
Whoa!

47:25.496 --> 47:28.149
Hit 'im, Dad! Hit 'im.

47:28.219 --> 47:31.154
Okay, we're even.
You hit me, I hit you. It's over.

47:31.226 --> 47:34.544
Now, I'm takin' my family
and I'm leavin'.

47:34.620 --> 47:37.272
- No, you're not.
- Look out, Dad! He's got a gun!

47:40.381 --> 47:42.390
Roarke.

47:46.815 --> 47:49.402
Don't! Damn it!

47:50.914 --> 47:53.664
It's not gonna be that easy.

47:53.730 --> 47:55.902
Get off of her!

47:59.779 --> 48:01.886
Get off me!

48:01.957 --> 48:03.998
Get! Get!

48:08.070 --> 48:11.070
Don't, Wade! Stop!
He's my dad! Stop hitting him!

48:11.142 --> 48:13.926
This is not fun anymore.

48:13.992 --> 48:16.481
- Oh, God, no!
- Wade!

48:16.553 --> 48:20.165
Wade, please!
God, please, don't...

48:25.035 --> 48:27.370
I need your wife
to get me down the river.

48:27.436 --> 48:31.693
I need your son to control her.

48:31.757 --> 48:34.408
You and the dog are expendable.

48:34.478 --> 48:38.790
Right now, I think I'll get rid of...

48:38.864 --> 48:41.134
The dog.

48:41.201 --> 48:43.754
No! Run, Mags, run!

48:43.825 --> 48:47.438
Run, Maggie, run!
Run! Run!

49:06.168 --> 49:08.469
You got guts, Roarke.

49:10.521 --> 49:14.068
But you shouldn't have
broken your promise about the gun.

49:16.251 --> 49:18.936
Friends don't do that.

49:22.589 --> 49:24.793
I thought you were a nice guy.

49:24.861 --> 49:28.027
I am a nice guy.

49:29.055 --> 49:31.608
Just a different kind
of nice guy.

49:40.643 --> 49:44.572
Damn, Terry.
Looks like we lose our deposit.

49:44.643 --> 49:47.579
All right!

49:47.653 --> 49:50.271
Now that I'm head of the family,
here's what we're gonna do!

49:50.341 --> 49:54.947
We're gonna haul ass down this river.
No more fishing. No more sightseeing.

49:55.015 --> 49:58.660
And unfortunately,
no more skinny dipping.

49:58.728 --> 50:00.102
By the way, Gail...

50:00.167 --> 50:02.624
You're gonna get another chance
to run the Gauntlet.

50:02.697 --> 50:05.927
- We're not stopping at Bridle Creek.
- What?

50:05.994 --> 50:10.337
That's right. Come on, let's get
this shit up the hill and outta sight!

50:14.125 --> 50:16.547
Roarke.

50:16.622 --> 50:19.109
Were you takin'
pictures of me?

50:20.014 --> 50:22.120
Give me that camera.

50:41.617 --> 50:45.708
You know, it's really dangerous
to be tied into the raft like this.

50:45.776 --> 50:48.742
If we flip, we'll just
be dragged under and drowned.

50:48.815 --> 50:52.940
It would be dangerous for me if you were
to flip us on purpose. I could drown.

50:53.007 --> 50:55.559
This just levels the playing field.

51:50.247 --> 51:52.899
Sure is pretty country, isn't it?

52:01.063 --> 52:03.615
What's in the green bag, Wade?

52:07.238 --> 52:11.013
It's the money, isn't it?
From the cattle auction?

52:11.078 --> 52:14.046
You guys robbed
the cattle auction, right?

52:14.119 --> 52:18.722
If we had, it'd be a pretty
slow getaway, wouldn't it?

52:18.788 --> 52:21.342
Yeah, it's slow,
but it's smart, sort of.

52:21.413 --> 52:23.933
This close to Canada...

52:24.004 --> 52:25.913
they'd think you
jumped the border...

52:25.988 --> 52:29.667
but instead you just go off road
for four or five days.

52:29.733 --> 52:32.766
End up couple of
hundred miles downriver...

52:32.836 --> 52:35.324
where you have a car waiting.

52:37.155 --> 52:41.694
Couple of...
Big problems, though.

52:41.763 --> 52:44.762
Frank and the Gauntlet.

52:48.002 --> 52:51.296
Frank was supposed to take you
down the Gauntlet, right?

52:51.361 --> 52:55.834
But what was he? Wounded?
So you had to finish him off.

52:55.905 --> 52:59.517
Did you do it, Wade?
Or did you make Terry kill him?

52:59.583 --> 53:01.439
Shut up!

53:05.153 --> 53:08.895
So what's the big problem
with the Gauntlet anyway?

53:11.103 --> 53:14.234
The Gauntlet is just...

53:14.304 --> 53:16.507
It's not just the size
of the water, you know.

53:16.575 --> 53:19.957
Although the three rivers
do all pour into that one canyon.

53:20.030 --> 53:22.234
But it's glacier water, so...

53:22.301 --> 53:26.676
You know what hypothermia is?

53:26.748 --> 53:28.757
Probably not.

53:30.877 --> 53:34.453
If the raft gets caught in there,
it gets sucked under the falls.

53:34.523 --> 53:36.379
It's kind of like being
in a washing machine, you know.

53:36.443 --> 53:40.786
You can just churn and churn
and churn in there 'til Christmas.

53:42.970 --> 53:45.305
But swimming ability
is not the problem.

53:45.370 --> 53:50.356
Swimming... is beside the point.

53:55.386 --> 53:56.927
I'm sorry.

53:57.562 --> 53:59.281
I'm sorry.

54:03.323 --> 54:06.168
I just can't believe
this is happening to us now.

54:08.375 --> 54:12.434
I can't believe you think
I can take you down there.

54:45.429 --> 54:48.876
Mom? Mom, I'm hungry.

54:48.947 --> 54:51.185
- What?
- I'm really hungry.

54:51.253 --> 54:53.871
- He's gotta have something to eat.
- He can eat in the boat.

54:53.939 --> 54:57.168
Yeah, well,
we can't pee in the boat.

55:09.520 --> 55:11.975
Come on. Let's go over here.

55:12.048 --> 55:13.903
Hello, the beach!

55:18.817 --> 55:21.151
Hello, the canoe.

55:21.217 --> 55:23.518
Terry, come on.
Get 'em up here.

55:25.536 --> 55:29.309
Wade and Terry are old family friends.
Remember, Wade has the gun.

55:29.375 --> 55:33.149
Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.
How ya doin', Officer?

55:33.214 --> 55:35.964
Shoot. On a day like today?
Can't complain. How you doin'?

55:36.031 --> 55:37.688
Not too bad.

55:37.758 --> 55:40.028
I been tryin' to catch you folks ever
since I heard you were on the river.

55:40.095 --> 55:42.963
But the office told me
there were only three of you.

55:43.037 --> 55:45.656
Been five right from the start.
Wanna see our tags?

55:45.724 --> 55:49.467
No. I must've heard wrong. You guys have
been travelin' along pretty quickly.

55:49.534 --> 55:52.467
I was afraid you were gonna
get to Bridal Creek and be gone.

55:52.541 --> 55:55.126
Well, Gail here is our guide.
She makes the trip so interestin'...

55:55.195 --> 55:56.602
that once she
shows us one thing...

55:56.668 --> 55:59.157
we just wanna move on to
the next as quick as we can.

55:59.228 --> 56:01.683
I can believe that.
She sure made my life interesting.

56:04.251 --> 56:06.105
I'm sorry.
Do I know you?

56:06.171 --> 56:11.190
Well, on more than one occasion you
tried to get me into bed... before 9:00.

56:11.258 --> 56:14.357
But usually you spent more time
with my older brother and his friends.

56:14.425 --> 56:16.213
- Johnny?
- Yeah!

56:16.281 --> 56:18.321
Oh, Johnny!

56:18.393 --> 56:22.037
Oh! How's Raymond?
And... And your folks?

56:22.105 --> 56:25.007
Oh, my folks are fine.
Raymond lives outside of Boise now.

56:25.082 --> 56:28.211
My brother and Gail, they used
to be the terrors of this river.

56:28.280 --> 56:31.280
The little kids... my friends and I...
we used to call her Whitewater.

56:32.376 --> 56:35.222
Whitewater, huh?

56:35.288 --> 56:38.549
We never had nicknames where
I came from. Certainly not Whitewater.

56:38.615 --> 56:40.883
White trash, maybe.

56:40.951 --> 56:43.796
Now, I hear it's worse
in this country to be an Indian...

56:43.861 --> 56:46.580
than it is even
a-a black or a Mexican.

56:47.606 --> 56:50.193
Is that right...
Ranger Johnny?

56:50.263 --> 56:54.516
Ahem. I-I'm Tom. I, uh...
I'm Whitewater's husband.

56:56.052 --> 56:58.386
- Really nice to meet you, Tom.
- Nice to meet you.

56:58.453 --> 57:00.689
What happened to your eye?

57:00.756 --> 57:05.578
Uh, s-slipped on a rock and, uh,
met up with a tree. I hurt my knee too...

57:05.651 --> 57:07.691
Hi. I'm Terry.

57:07.764 --> 57:10.220
- Nice to meet ya.
- Friend.

57:10.291 --> 57:14.350
And I'm Wade.
And this is Roarke, Gail's son.

57:14.418 --> 57:16.274
Oh, hey, Roarke.
Nice to meet you too.

57:16.339 --> 57:18.476
I was about your age
when I first knew your mom.

57:20.968 --> 57:23.302
Well, now you've met everyone.

57:25.422 --> 57:27.331
I guess I have.

57:29.334 --> 57:31.754
Well, I better be shovin' off then.
I'll see ya.

57:32.337 --> 57:34.987
So we'll see you at
Bridal Creek, then?

57:35.057 --> 57:38.799
Oh, no, I gotta do a portage up to
Swanson Meadow and do a fish count.

57:39.580 --> 57:44.154
It was nice seein' ya again, Gail.
You guys take it easy.

57:44.719 --> 57:47.370
That was real smart.
Real smart.

57:47.440 --> 57:50.821
Oh, hey, uh, I almost forgot.
Did anybody lose a camera?

57:51.885 --> 57:53.740
Is it a yellow
waterproof one?

57:53.806 --> 57:56.588
- Yeah. Catch.
- Toss that puppy on up here, Johnny.

57:57.246 --> 58:00.028
Hey, Roarke!
Found your camera.

58:00.149 --> 58:03.086
- What do you say, big man?
- Thank you.

58:03.914 --> 58:05.890
You all take it easy now.

58:07.907 --> 58:10.046
- Bye.
- See ya later.

58:17.580 --> 58:20.580
You're a real smart man,
aren't ya? Huh?

58:20.651 --> 58:22.823
- Oh!
- Get in the boat!

58:22.892 --> 58:26.240
Get up! What do you think?
I'm some kind of idiot?

58:26.315 --> 58:29.609
Sit down.
Put your hands together.

58:29.674 --> 58:32.707
- Go right up there, sweetie.
- Sit in the middle.

59:41.186 --> 59:43.042
That's Bridal Creek up ahead.

59:46.433 --> 59:50.046
That's the last take-out
before the Gauntlet.

59:50.114 --> 59:52.086
Are Grandma and Grandpa gonna be there?

59:53.148 --> 59:56.378
No, sweetie. They're not
expecting us for two more days...

59:57.025 --> 59:59.675
so... they're not there yet.

01:00:04.347 --> 01:00:06.135
You still intend to go on?

01:00:06.383 --> 01:00:08.172
That's right.

01:00:09.554 --> 01:00:12.587
Then can Terry row
for a little bit?

01:00:12.893 --> 01:00:14.932
Can I get a break?

01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:17.956
Sure.

01:00:18.744 --> 01:00:20.981
Untie her.

01:00:28.734 --> 01:00:30.588
Keep an eye on them.

01:00:33.125 --> 01:00:34.979
You listen to me,
you little idiot!

01:00:35.086 --> 01:00:37.387
I'm not bullshitting you
about the Gauntlet. It's big.

01:00:37.618 --> 01:00:41.248
Bigger than anything you've ever seen.
And tomorrow, you're gonna drown in it.

01:00:41.249 --> 01:00:44.545
And the rest of us are gonna
be hauled under with the raft.

01:00:44.690 --> 01:00:48.432
I'm not gonna pretend that I give a shit
about you and your stupid friend...

01:00:48.483 --> 01:00:51.712
and your pathetic
small-time nothing life!

01:00:51.798 --> 01:00:54.442
But I got everything I care
about in the world in this boat.

01:00:54.443 --> 01:00:58.339
And I got my baby girl waiting at the
other end. And I know I cannot do this!

01:00:58.686 --> 01:01:03.598
I cannot row this big water, man!
That's the truth.

01:01:03.598 --> 01:01:05.769
I cannot do it!

01:01:12.214 --> 01:01:14.121
You're an amazing woman.

01:02:03.984 --> 01:02:05.902
I gotta get some sleep.

01:02:06.957 --> 01:02:10.119
Here. Wake me up at 1:00.

01:02:38.568 --> 01:02:40.956
Shh! Shh! Shh!

01:02:42.025 --> 01:02:43.879
- What are you doing?
- Shh! Shh!

01:02:45.352 --> 01:02:47.141
Terry's asleep.

01:02:47.208 --> 01:02:49.062
I'm gonna get the gun.

01:02:49.128 --> 01:02:51.396
No! No! You can't do that.
Oh, God!

01:02:51.464 --> 01:02:54.365
You can't do that.
If they catch you, they'll kill you.

01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:57.406
They're gonna kill us anyway,
even if we get through the Gauntlet.

01:02:57.479 --> 01:03:00.033
We have to do something.

01:03:01.510 --> 01:03:03.484
Just listen.
Wait. Wait. Wait.

01:03:03.557 --> 01:03:06.459
I was thinking about...
Little Niagara.

01:03:06.533 --> 01:03:11.171
It's a... It's a big drop
about two miles above the Gauntlet.

01:03:11.238 --> 01:03:14.334
I can take the raft
in there sideways and flip us.

01:03:14.404 --> 01:03:18.179
If we hold on to the D-rings, we can
catch the air pocket underneath...

01:03:18.243 --> 01:03:20.099
and they'll just be swept away.

01:03:21.188 --> 01:03:23.709
Well, will that work?

01:03:25.443 --> 01:03:29.501
It could work. It could work.
God. What other option do we have?

01:03:29.570 --> 01:03:31.512
I'm gonna get the gun.

01:03:34.723 --> 01:03:36.576
God.

01:03:38.946 --> 01:03:41.630
If I don't make it...

01:03:41.697 --> 01:03:44.479
you can still flip the boat.

01:03:57.856 --> 01:03:59.798
I love you too.

01:04:59.161 --> 01:05:01.713
Wade!

01:05:07.512 --> 01:05:09.878
Give me the gun.

01:05:12.406 --> 01:05:14.414
Stay here...
and watch them!

01:05:45.522 --> 01:05:47.410
Tom!

01:05:47.475 --> 01:05:49.995
Tom, are you up here?

01:05:50.064 --> 01:05:51.855
I don't think
you're up here.

01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:04.976
Shit.

01:06:18.031 --> 01:06:19.886
Tom!

01:06:21.103 --> 01:06:22.957
Tom!

01:06:23.023 --> 01:06:25.323
I know you're there!

01:06:26.829 --> 01:06:28.684
Tom!

01:06:30.607 --> 01:06:32.459
Where are you?

01:06:39.182 --> 01:06:41.285
Hey! There you are.

01:06:45.035 --> 01:06:49.823
How does it feel to know you only have
a few more seconds left to live?

01:06:53.708 --> 01:06:55.879
- Aah!
- Sit down!

01:06:55.946 --> 01:06:57.605
Damn.

01:06:58.763 --> 01:07:01.698
I don't have a very good
shot from here, Tom...

01:07:01.771 --> 01:07:04.487
so I'm gonna have to head
a little farther downriver.

01:07:08.011 --> 01:07:10.051
You stay where you are now.

01:07:17.801 --> 01:07:20.353
There. That's better.

01:07:20.424 --> 01:07:24.449
I'm gonna try to hit you in the spine...
right between the shoulder blades.

01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:26.592
You ready?

01:07:26.662 --> 01:07:28.353
Set.

01:08:06.211 --> 01:08:09.920
What are they doin' out?
Tie her in the tent. Kid too.

01:08:13.217 --> 01:08:15.323
- Where's my dad?
- He's dead.

01:08:15.392 --> 01:08:17.533
Dead? Why'd you kill him?

01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:19.805
- He was tryin' to get away.
- You killed my dad.

01:08:19.872 --> 01:08:22.687
So what if he got away?
Where's he gonna go? We can't walk out.

01:08:22.751 --> 01:08:25.786
- How the hell is he gonna?
- Do you wanna make the decisions, huh?

01:08:25.856 --> 01:08:28.312
Here's the gun.
Go ahead.

01:08:28.384 --> 01:08:32.345
Hey, man. When we started this thing,
you told me no one was gonna get hurt.

01:08:33.823 --> 01:08:36.212
Now three people are dead!

01:08:36.287 --> 01:08:38.140
Whose fault is that?

01:08:38.206 --> 01:08:41.054
Did I tell you
to frisk the guard? Huh?

01:08:41.118 --> 01:08:43.420
Did I tell you
to frisk the guard?

01:08:43.487 --> 01:08:46.301
If you'd have frisked the guard
like I told ya, Frank would be alive.

01:08:46.366 --> 01:08:49.877
If you'd stayed awake
like I told ya, Tom would be alive!

01:08:49.948 --> 01:08:54.205
Now shut your fat mouth
and tie them in the tent.

01:08:54.270 --> 01:08:57.334
Oh, man.

01:08:57.404 --> 01:09:00.371
- I will be right there.
- No! No, Mommy!

01:09:00.444 --> 01:09:02.299
- You go with him.
- Stop it!

01:09:02.363 --> 01:09:04.219
Where is he?
I wanna see him.

01:09:04.283 --> 01:09:06.968
Can't help you there.
He's in the river.

01:09:08.956 --> 01:09:10.810
Well, then he might
still be alive.

01:09:12.314 --> 01:09:15.631
I shot him, Whitewater.
He's dead.

01:09:15.707 --> 01:09:17.562
I'm sorry.

01:09:24.761 --> 01:09:26.582
No tears.

01:09:26.648 --> 01:09:30.959
Things must've been worse
between you and Tom than I thought.

01:09:48.629 --> 01:09:50.486
I'm gonna kill you.

01:09:57.716 --> 01:09:59.921
I'm gonna kill you, Wade.

01:10:05.299 --> 01:10:07.308
I don't think so.

01:10:12.083 --> 01:10:13.937
I'm runnin' the show.

01:10:15.091 --> 01:10:16.946
I could bury you
and Roarke tonight.

01:10:19.250 --> 01:10:21.226
I could do anything
I want with you.

01:10:22.291 --> 01:10:25.356
So go ahead.

01:10:25.426 --> 01:10:29.834
Don't keep tellin' me how tough
you are, Wade. Just show me.

01:10:31.826 --> 01:10:33.449
Come on.

01:10:34.513 --> 01:10:36.269
Do it.

01:10:52.656 --> 01:10:55.753
Terry. Put her in the tent.

01:12:16.054 --> 01:12:19.763
Terry, get up. Come on!
Get up! Get up!

01:12:21.302 --> 01:12:23.820
Come on. Pack this shit up.
We gotta get outta here.

01:12:28.820 --> 01:12:31.155
When you're done with that,
just grab those oars.

01:12:31.220 --> 01:12:34.067
- Forget the rest of their stuff.
- All right, all right.

01:12:38.579 --> 01:12:41.362
Oh! Ah! Oh!

01:12:43.027 --> 01:12:45.547
All right.
Come on. Let's go.

01:12:45.619 --> 01:12:47.528
Let's go. Come on.

01:15:00.130 --> 01:15:01.954
Uh! Oh!

01:15:02.018 --> 01:15:05.912
Oh, Maggie! You good girl, you!
It's good to see you!

01:15:05.986 --> 01:15:08.636
Yes! Yes!
Good girl! Good girl!

01:15:08.705 --> 01:15:11.095
Come on, girl.
Let's go.

01:15:13.250 --> 01:15:14.972
Come on!

01:15:16.001 --> 01:15:17.856
We gotta get ahead
of 'em, girl.

01:15:26.110 --> 01:15:29.428
Hey. You wanna listen
to some music?

01:15:34.590 --> 01:15:39.807
I have to go along with Wade.
He didn't mind goin' to jail.

01:15:39.870 --> 01:15:42.586
He don't seem
to mind anything.

01:15:42.654 --> 01:15:44.725
I can't go back
to jail, Roarke.

01:15:47.517 --> 01:15:49.905
I don't care.

01:16:14.490 --> 01:16:16.856
Terry, hand me that box
of cartridges, will you?

01:16:29.785 --> 01:16:31.759
Hey, Wade!

01:16:36.248 --> 01:16:38.735
Go, Mom!

01:16:41.080 --> 01:16:42.934
We're gonna make it!

01:16:45.751 --> 01:16:47.724
Gail.

01:16:49.366 --> 01:16:51.253
Three left.

01:17:02.326 --> 01:17:05.193
Okay, Mags, here's where
we get ahead of 'em.

01:17:08.756 --> 01:17:12.618
Oh, go slow, Gail.
For once in your life don't be first.

01:17:38.863 --> 01:17:41.929
That's it, Mags.
That's Little Niagara.

01:17:41.999 --> 01:17:43.910
That's where she's
gonna flip the boat.

01:18:01.805 --> 01:18:04.108
What?

01:18:04.172 --> 01:18:06.506
Oh, shit.
What's that?

01:18:06.571 --> 01:18:11.494
- What's around the corner?
- That? That's Little Niagara.

01:18:16.909 --> 01:18:18.696
Get in the back
with the kid.

01:18:20.394 --> 01:18:22.217
You're up.

01:18:25.257 --> 01:18:27.396
Come on. Come on.

01:18:29.066 --> 01:18:31.041
Come on!

01:18:32.363 --> 01:18:35.908
Roarke.
Put your helmet on, buddy.

01:18:38.858 --> 01:18:40.864
Come on.

01:19:16.423 --> 01:19:20.450
- Roarke!
- What are you doin'? Wade!

01:19:20.519 --> 01:19:22.821
- They're talkin' or whatever!
- Hey!

01:19:22.886 --> 01:19:26.203
What are you sayin' to him?
Hey, what did you say?

01:19:28.264 --> 01:19:30.848
What are you doin'?
What the hell are you doin'? Huh?

01:19:30.918 --> 01:19:33.600
I'm just getting
into position.

01:19:37.445 --> 01:19:41.219
Look up, Gail.
Please, look up here.

01:19:41.284 --> 01:19:44.131
Hang on, Terry.
Gail thinks she's gonna flip us.

01:19:44.196 --> 01:19:46.401
- But I don't think she has the guts.
- Mom.

01:20:02.114 --> 01:20:04.001
Oh, yes!

01:20:09.313 --> 01:20:11.800
Whoa!

01:20:16.735 --> 01:20:19.703
- Grab the oar!
- Where'd he go?

01:20:22.111 --> 01:20:24.664
- Where is he?
- I got it!

01:20:25.534 --> 01:20:27.389
I got it!

01:20:29.727 --> 01:20:32.246
He's right over there!

01:20:32.317 --> 01:20:34.652
- Pick him up!
- We're stuck in the hole!

01:20:34.719 --> 01:20:36.987
I'm tryin' to get us out!

01:20:48.574 --> 01:20:51.420
What was that, Gail?
What happened with that oar?

01:20:51.485 --> 01:20:53.656
I lost control.

01:20:53.724 --> 01:20:58.000
- I just completely lost control.
- What the hell was Frank talkin' about?

01:20:58.076 --> 01:21:00.694
He said this river shit
was gonna be easy!

01:21:00.763 --> 01:21:03.762
I think Frank
had somethin' else in mind.

01:21:03.835 --> 01:21:05.690
Did ya ever think of that?

01:21:05.754 --> 01:21:09.583
I bet Frank thought he'd just dump
you two somewhere along the line...

01:21:09.659 --> 01:21:11.599
and run the Gauntlet
with a nice, light boat.

01:21:11.673 --> 01:21:15.865
Did he tell you you'd have to work?
You guys are gonna have to...

01:21:15.931 --> 01:21:19.573
throw your weight and high-side it
if we wrap around one of these rocks.

01:21:19.641 --> 01:21:22.162
You're gonna have to
paddle hard when I tell ya.

01:21:22.233 --> 01:21:24.338
And you're gonna have to do
what I say when I say it!

01:21:24.409 --> 01:21:26.800
Otherwise, we got no chance
in hell of makin' it through.

01:21:28.183 --> 01:21:31.479
And what makes you suddenly
so anxious to get us through?

01:21:36.662 --> 01:21:38.670
I don't think you know me
well enough to determine...

01:21:38.742 --> 01:21:41.972
if I'm being anxious
or if I'm being efficient.

01:21:42.037 --> 01:21:45.333
Let's grab the paddles and do some
practice runs. Get up front, Terry.

01:21:47.189 --> 01:21:49.044
Do it!

01:21:55.796 --> 01:21:58.163
All forward. One! Two!

01:21:58.228 --> 01:22:00.268
Dig it in, Terry.
You gotta pull your weight.

01:22:00.340 --> 01:22:03.309
- My neck hurts!
- You're breakin' my heart. Let's go!

01:22:08.468 --> 01:22:13.998
One. Two. Left turn.
Come on. Dig in.

01:22:34.895 --> 01:22:36.838
Oh, my God.

01:22:38.863 --> 01:22:40.717
Oh, my God, Gail!

01:23:13.452 --> 01:23:17.226
Mags, we gotta get across.
Come on, girl!

01:23:17.291 --> 01:23:19.201
Try it again. Harder.

01:23:19.275 --> 01:23:22.853
Dig it. One! Go together.
Two! Go together.

01:23:22.923 --> 01:23:25.289
Three!
Stay with it!

01:23:33.258 --> 01:23:36.105
Mags, we don't have time
to look for a way down.

01:23:36.169 --> 01:23:38.024
You think you can do this, huh?

01:23:38.089 --> 01:23:40.325
You think you can do this?
Okay, girl.

01:23:40.393 --> 01:23:43.687
I love you too.
Here we go.

01:23:44.903 --> 01:23:47.687
You ready, girl?
We'll both go on three.

01:23:48.518 --> 01:23:52.544
One. Two. Three.

01:23:52.613 --> 01:23:54.469
Come on!

01:24:02.471 --> 01:24:06.047
Come on, girl! Maggie, come!
You can do it!

01:24:06.116 --> 01:24:10.427
Oh, come on, girl!
No, don't go back! Maggie!

01:24:10.500 --> 01:24:13.184
Come on, Maggie!
Oh, please!

01:24:13.254 --> 01:24:15.555
Maggie! Come!

01:24:16.771 --> 01:24:18.681
Maggie. Go!

01:24:20.676 --> 01:24:22.584
That a girl!

01:24:24.932 --> 01:24:28.313
Good girl! You know, that's
the first time you've ever minded me.

01:24:28.386 --> 01:24:29.761
Oh, good girl!

01:24:29.826 --> 01:24:31.256
What are you doin'?

01:24:31.331 --> 01:24:33.697
I have to scout
the entrance to the Gauntlet.

01:24:33.762 --> 01:24:35.704
This is the only place
I can do it from.

01:24:35.778 --> 01:24:39.006
Terry, get in the back.
Get ready to secure the line.

01:24:41.473 --> 01:24:43.807
Come on, Mags!

01:24:43.873 --> 01:24:47.136
- Let's go.
- I have to go to the bathroom.

01:24:47.201 --> 01:24:49.056
I'll take you in a second.

01:24:52.769 --> 01:24:55.866
- That's it?
- That's it.

01:24:55.935 --> 01:25:00.922
Once you enter that canyon,
there's no stopping and no turning back.

01:25:00.991 --> 01:25:04.667
The three rivers converge
and drop 295 feet...

01:25:04.735 --> 01:25:06.873
in a little over
a mile and a half.

01:25:19.550 --> 01:25:21.404
Oh, shit!

01:25:23.390 --> 01:25:25.081
Wade!

01:25:33.051 --> 01:25:34.906
Now what?

01:25:34.971 --> 01:25:36.880
Well, that depends on you.

01:25:36.956 --> 01:25:40.403
Now, if you love your mama, you're
gonna keep your little mouth shut.

01:25:40.474 --> 01:25:41.902
You hear me?

01:25:42.810 --> 01:25:44.850
- Johnny!
- Hey, Johnny!

01:25:44.920 --> 01:25:47.222
- Hello again.
- What are you doin' down here?

01:25:47.290 --> 01:25:51.894
Well, I heard someone went past
the take-out at Bridal Creek...

01:25:51.961 --> 01:25:54.263
so I came down here
to see what's up.

01:25:54.328 --> 01:25:57.144
Gail's givin' me a look at
the site of her former glory.

01:25:57.209 --> 01:26:00.242
Yeah. It's just as amazing
as I remember.

01:26:00.313 --> 01:26:02.833
You aren't thinkin' about
doin' anything crazy, are ya?

01:26:02.902 --> 01:26:06.515
Well! To tell you the truth...

01:26:06.584 --> 01:26:10.643
Yeah, we... I've... I've always wanted
to run the Gauntlet again, you know?

01:26:10.712 --> 01:26:15.217
And Wade here will try anything,
so... here we are.

01:26:15.286 --> 01:26:18.002
Where's everybody else?
Your son and all them?

01:26:18.070 --> 01:26:21.069
Uh, Tom and Roarke got out
at Bridal Creek with Terry.

01:26:21.141 --> 01:26:24.524
Yeah, they're down below.
We're gonna meet 'em down there.

01:26:24.598 --> 01:26:28.109
Geez! Well, Gail,
I can't let you do it.

01:26:28.179 --> 01:26:31.312
- Let us?
- No way. It's too dangerous.

01:26:31.382 --> 01:26:34.730
I'm gonna have to radio for a helicopter
to come and transport you outta here.

01:26:36.180 --> 01:26:38.066
Look, Gail, I hate to
be the bad guy here.

01:26:38.131 --> 01:26:41.710
I'd like to try the Gauntlet myself, but
people aren't allowed to do it anymore.

01:26:41.780 --> 01:26:45.095
- You know I've run this once before.
- Yeah.

01:26:45.170 --> 01:26:49.448
Why can't you just... go away,
pretend you didn't even see us?

01:26:49.522 --> 01:26:52.556
- Oh, boy, uh...
- Johnny's right, Gail.

01:26:52.626 --> 01:26:56.138
Somethin' tells me Ranger Johnny
might not be too good at pretending.

01:27:21.679 --> 01:27:24.494
He said he always wanted
to try the Gauntlet.

01:27:25.519 --> 01:27:28.333
I just gave him his wish.

01:28:18.536 --> 01:28:22.431
- Put the kid in the boat!
- First we have to unload some things.

01:28:22.503 --> 01:28:24.924
Why?

01:28:27.398 --> 01:28:30.180
We have to ride higher
in the water.

01:28:30.247 --> 01:28:33.858
So I have to rebalance the boat
so that you can paddle in the front.

01:28:53.956 --> 01:28:56.258
Now don't let go
of that rope... ever!

01:28:56.324 --> 01:29:00.414
And stay low in the gunnel.
Okay? Okay.

01:29:00.481 --> 01:29:03.264
Listen, before we do this,
I need to ask you a favor.

01:29:03.330 --> 01:29:08.349
Please... Please don't tie
Roarke in the boat.

01:29:10.497 --> 01:29:13.564
I'm sorry.
I can't do that, Gail.

01:29:13.633 --> 01:29:16.251
I need you to be
the best that you can be.

01:29:18.336 --> 01:29:21.653
Go ahead and let it go. Indian Johnny
won't be needin' it anymore.

01:30:09.230 --> 01:30:11.815
We can do this, Wade.
We can do it.

01:30:11.884 --> 01:30:14.185
You just... hold together.

01:30:14.252 --> 01:30:16.641
- Paddle together. All right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:30:16.719 --> 01:30:19.368
Keep breathing.
Don't fall out.

01:30:19.437 --> 01:30:21.707
I need you both in the boat
to make it down this thing.

01:30:21.774 --> 01:30:25.252
Roarke? You okay?
Hold on tight.

01:30:25.324 --> 01:30:28.039
- You love your mommy? Good boy.
- Yeah.

01:30:28.108 --> 01:30:32.547
Feel like goin' to Boston?
Me too. Vacation's over.

01:30:34.093 --> 01:30:36.065
- What's that?
- What's that noise?

01:30:36.138 --> 01:30:38.592
This is where the
first two rivers come together.

01:30:38.667 --> 01:30:41.318
Straighten me out... now.

01:30:53.064 --> 01:30:56.862
Straighten it out. We got the froth
straight ahead. We're gonna go left.

01:30:58.314 --> 01:31:00.450
- We're gonna hit that rock!
- Get up, Terry!

01:31:00.520 --> 01:31:03.204
- Turn it!
- Mom!

01:31:03.272 --> 01:31:06.403
- What do we do?
- All right. Back! Back paddle!

01:31:08.072 --> 01:31:12.992
Left! Left!
Bring it around or we're gonna hit!

01:31:13.062 --> 01:31:14.852
Left! Hard! Terry!

01:31:14.919 --> 01:31:18.628
- Look out, Mom!
- Hold your paddle!

01:31:19.719 --> 01:31:21.606
Put your weight on it!

01:31:28.997 --> 01:31:31.299
Keep paddling!
All forward! Let's go!

01:31:34.629 --> 01:31:36.481
Stay right in the middle!

01:31:40.677 --> 01:31:43.392
- Don't put me in that hole!
- Which way?

01:31:43.460 --> 01:31:45.435
No, no, no!
Don't back that way!

01:31:45.507 --> 01:31:47.360
Oh! We missed it!

01:31:47.426 --> 01:31:49.369
We're goin' in.
Hold on, Roarke!

01:31:57.378 --> 01:31:59.285
Wade! Wade!

01:31:59.361 --> 01:32:02.264
Pull him in!
Grab him by his jacket, Terry.

01:32:02.337 --> 01:32:04.540
Pull him in!
We need him. Damn it!

01:32:07.841 --> 01:32:11.996
- Get in, Wade!
- Grab your paddle. Get into position.

01:32:26.141 --> 01:32:30.364
Pull! Okay.
Left turn. Let's go.

01:32:30.430 --> 01:32:32.338
- Why?
- We have to go this way.

01:32:32.413 --> 01:32:34.746
There's a 40-foot drop
on the other side.

01:32:34.814 --> 01:32:37.114
- No!
- You gotta line me up good, boys.

01:32:39.260 --> 01:32:41.747
Get ready!
Pull in your paddles!

01:32:44.957 --> 01:32:47.443
Look out!

01:32:47.517 --> 01:32:51.889
I got it. Hang on!
We're gonna rejoin the main river.

01:32:53.020 --> 01:32:55.409
Straight into it!

01:33:07.033 --> 01:33:10.067
- Are we goin' down that?
- You bet!

01:33:10.139 --> 01:33:12.504
No way, man!
I can't do this!

01:33:14.712 --> 01:33:18.324
- Hold on, Roarke!
- Hurry, Mom!

01:33:25.974 --> 01:33:29.270
- Take us out!
- Paddle, Terry!

01:33:49.012 --> 01:33:50.865
Oh, my God.

01:34:06.867 --> 01:34:09.202
Get me away from that wall!
Straight down the middle!

01:34:12.147 --> 01:34:14.536
What do we do?
Are you nuts?

01:34:23.792 --> 01:34:25.996
- Get up!
- Get up, Terry!

01:34:26.063 --> 01:34:29.577
We're turning!
We're getting sucked back in!

01:34:35.758 --> 01:34:38.955
- Are you okay, darling?
- I'm okay Mommy. Ohh!

01:34:39.025 --> 01:34:40.878
We made it!
We did it!

01:34:40.944 --> 01:34:43.398
That was the Gauntlet, man!
We did it! Right?

01:34:43.472 --> 01:34:46.088
Wade, we're not done yet.

01:34:46.158 --> 01:34:49.091
- What?
- That was the easy part.

01:35:04.876 --> 01:35:07.080
Watch what you're
fuckin' doin'!

01:35:07.147 --> 01:35:09.666
- Yaaah!
- We're losing it!

01:35:18.697 --> 01:35:21.447
- Back! Push it!
- Back! Hard!

01:35:22.569 --> 01:35:24.393
Harder!

01:35:24.458 --> 01:35:26.279
- Further on now! Left!
- I got it!

01:35:37.417 --> 01:35:40.765
We get through this...
and we're through.

01:35:42.247 --> 01:35:45.596
We make it through this
and we're home.

01:35:53.831 --> 01:35:55.718
Straighten it out!

01:36:15.555 --> 01:36:18.490
- We're getting sucked under!
- Which way?

01:36:18.564 --> 01:36:21.693
- Back paddle! No, Wade, back!
- Mom!

01:36:21.763 --> 01:36:25.984
- We're goin' under!
- Backwards! Pull it! Back!

01:36:32.802 --> 01:36:35.767
That's it! That's it.

01:36:35.842 --> 01:36:38.938
- We're out!
- All right, Mom!

01:36:40.545 --> 01:36:42.716
Yahoo!

01:36:42.784 --> 01:36:44.987
Yaaaah!

01:36:50.367 --> 01:36:52.254
We did it!

01:37:00.839 --> 01:37:03.295
- Yeah! Yeah!
- We made it!

01:37:10.662 --> 01:37:14.207
- Back paddle! Back paddle!
- What?

01:37:14.279 --> 01:37:17.180
- What are you doin'?
- I'm a little tired.

01:37:17.253 --> 01:37:19.042
Can you untie Roarke now?

01:37:20.422 --> 01:37:23.236
Sure. Why not?

01:37:28.164 --> 01:37:30.269
Maggie!

01:37:33.924 --> 01:37:35.963
Whoa!

01:37:37.251 --> 01:37:38.909
Stay down!

01:37:48.673 --> 01:37:50.429
Dad! Get him!

01:37:53.634 --> 01:37:55.520
Mom!

01:38:08.670 --> 01:38:12.565
- Gun.
- Let go of him! Let him go!

01:38:12.638 --> 01:38:14.940
Hey! Terry!

01:38:15.007 --> 01:38:16.981
No! No!

01:38:17.053 --> 01:38:18.909
Pull that oar.
Keep pullin' on it for me.

01:38:18.975 --> 01:38:20.881
- Pull it in hard. Hard!
- Okay.

01:38:23.998 --> 01:38:26.813
Come on, my love!
All your might!

01:38:40.252 --> 01:38:42.106
Come on, buddy!

01:38:46.235 --> 01:38:49.748
Goddamn! Terry!
Gimme that goddamn money!

01:38:49.819 --> 01:38:51.674
That bitch broke my arm!

01:39:01.851 --> 01:39:06.486
Stop! Roarke, you take Maggie and run up
to those trees... now! Go! Go!

01:39:06.553 --> 01:39:10.513
Don't shoot, Gail! No, no!
Don't shoot! Come on! Wait a minute!

01:39:10.584 --> 01:39:12.439
Terry! Back off!

01:39:12.504 --> 01:39:17.490
Back off, goddamn it!
Gail. Gail. Please.

01:39:17.560 --> 01:39:21.073
I'm not gonna hurt you.
I'm not gonna hurt Roarke.

01:39:22.711 --> 01:39:27.894
I just needed you to get us
down the river and, and you did that.

01:39:27.958 --> 01:39:30.806
A-And you could just let
me and Terry be on our way and...

01:39:30.871 --> 01:39:35.571
you could go back to your family and...
Oh, please, Gail.

01:39:35.638 --> 01:39:39.466
Come on now. You can't kill me.
You're not like that.

01:39:39.540 --> 01:39:42.192
'Cause if you kill me, Gail...

01:39:42.261 --> 01:39:44.781
you're gonna spend
the rest of your life...

01:39:44.852 --> 01:39:47.667
wonderin' if you had to kill me.

01:39:48.948 --> 01:39:51.248
And there's no way...

01:39:51.314 --> 01:39:54.665
There's no way
you're ever gonna know.

01:39:56.690 --> 01:39:58.314
No way.

01:40:14.833 --> 01:40:16.588
That's funny.

01:40:17.969 --> 01:40:19.975
I thought there was one left too.

01:40:23.632 --> 01:40:25.486
What am I talkin' to you for?

01:40:28.336 --> 01:40:32.557
Kill him, Terry.
Catch that kid... and kill him too.

01:40:32.622 --> 01:40:34.988
No!

01:40:35.053 --> 01:40:37.541
Wrong, Wade.

01:40:39.052 --> 01:40:40.908
There was a way.

01:41:25.032 --> 01:41:27.007
Roarke!

01:41:29.672 --> 01:41:33.381
Oh! Untie me, honey.
Roarke's okay.

01:41:33.447 --> 01:41:37.125
Don't... Come on... Uh!

01:41:37.191 --> 01:41:39.973
Oh, Roarke.
Oh, Roarke.

01:41:40.038 --> 01:41:41.925
- Daddy!
- Oh, my God.

01:41:57.669 --> 01:41:59.555
So were ya scared, Roarke?

01:41:59.620 --> 01:42:02.436
Only of Wade and Terry.

01:42:02.501 --> 01:42:04.540
But I wasn't scared
of the river.

01:42:04.611 --> 01:42:07.393
I knew my mom could
handle the river.

01:42:07.460 --> 01:42:11.136
And she brought you through
the Gauntlet by herself?

01:42:11.202 --> 01:42:14.551
- Yeah.
- What about your father? What did he do?

01:42:14.627 --> 01:42:17.377
My dad?

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:25.944
He saved our lives.
