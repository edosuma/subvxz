I'm not feeling it!

10:17.207 --> 10:18.581
Uh, it's pretty
(bleep) bright.

10:18.639 --> 10:20.065
It's just not
doing it for me, man.

10:20.123 --> 10:22.057

10:25.540 --> 10:27.128
Oh, yeah.

10:27.414 --> 10:28.814
Oh, keep 'er coming.

I'm good.

10:40.999 --> 10:42.608
- Awesome, great.
- What's up? You wanna get weird?

10:42.666 --> 10:46.456
Okay, no, listen, my mom,
like, apparently had a lump

10:46.514 --> 10:48.417
in her breast, and
she didn't tell me about it.

10:48.475 --> 10:49.928
It's fine now,
it's fine.

10:50.116 --> 10:51.636
But, like, it really
scared the shit out of me.

10:51.694 --> 10:52.999
And so tonight
she wants to have, like,

10:53.069 --> 10:55.040

You know, I was trying to
decrease for the pure and strong

20:09.425 --> 20:12.597
or something, but that's shame
and stigma right there.

20:12.708 --> 20:15.508
So, I get sick sometimes
and need medicine, who cares?

20:15.566 --> 20:16.966
That's awesome, dude.

20:17.024 --> 20:18.124
I found one.

20:18.229 --> 20:20.120
Ooh, that's pretty.

20:20.178 --> 20:21.745
- That is a good one.
- It's a good one.

20:21.803 --> 20:23.759
- Whoa.
- Holy sh... O0h!

20:23.904 --> 20:26.097
So, I just wanted
to offer you this Mom Pak.

20:26.155 --> 20:28.800
It's really popular
among your demographic.

20:28.858 --> 20:30.268
She doesn't need a Mom Pak.

20:30.326 --> 20:31.503
She's a city girl now.

20:31.561 --> 20:32.592
Oh.

20:32.690 --> 20:33.932
Whatever.

20:34.239 --> 20:35.823
But thank you.

20:35.980 --> 20:37.080
Whoa.

20:37.147 --> 20:38.613
You know what this
slut would love?

20:38.680 --> 20:39.790
Okay, let's... stop
calling her that.

20:39.857 --> 20:41.280
- She loves it.
- I do.

20:41.479 --> 20:42.565
Okay.

20:43.324 --> 20:44.390
Dat.

20:44.448 --> 20:46.117
Yes.

20:46.175 --> 20:48.143
Mom, you're gonna love that.
You deserve the best.

20:48.245 --> 20:50.547
But, um, hand wash it only.

20:50.647 --> 20:51.909
Mm.

20:52.050 --> 20:54.318
Yeah, definitely
just hand... wash it.
