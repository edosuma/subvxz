WEBVTT

00:38.038 --> 00:39.996
Was that any good?

00:42.129 --> 00:43.695
- I've been streaming
some examples

00:43.739 --> 00:46.089
of how moms connect
with their daughters.

00:46.133 --> 00:47.308
Seems like we're
supposed to binge-eat

00:47.351 --> 00:48.918
while talking
about disappointment.

00:48.961 --> 00:49.962
Mm? You go fir--

00:50.006 --> 00:51.181
Hey! Trophy!

00:51.225 --> 00:53.575
Get to work,
you spoiled potato couch!

00:53.618 --> 00:56.143
We funeral home,
not cruise ship deck!

00:56.186 --> 00:58.667
- I am at work -- being
a stay-at-home mom to Annie.

00:58.710 --> 01:01.017
- Hey! Motherhood curse, not job.

01:01.061 --> 01:04.586
- We are working on our
mother-daughter bond, Baba.

01:04.629 --> 01:06.718
We can't just expect her
to suddenly know

01:06.762 --> 01:09.852
how to make hot cocoa
or listen when I talk.

01:09.895 --> 01:11.723
- It'll free up a lot
of my emotional bandwidth

01:11.767 --> 01:14.117
when my spray-tan membership
expires next month.

01:14.161 --> 01:17.381
- Look! I give ultimatum
my baba gave me --

01:17.425 --> 01:19.253
work for family funeral home,

01:19.296 --> 01:22.299
get job in village,
or marry brother.

01:22.343 --> 01:24.084
- You picked
funeral home, right?

01:24.127 --> 01:26.216
- I don't remember.
My baba chose for me.

01:26.260 --> 01:28.523
- Hey, sis! You know
I'm game for whatevs,

01:28.566 --> 01:30.786
but I picked
"work for family funeral home."

01:30.829 --> 01:32.657
I was born with
resting-grief-face,

01:32.701 --> 01:33.832
I get to work with my mom,

01:33.876 --> 01:35.617
and touching corpses
doesn't bother me.

01:35.660 --> 01:37.575
In fact, I prefer it!

01:37.619 --> 01:39.360
- I'll get a job.

01:41.231 --> 01:44.060
- You're not remotely qualified
for these positions.

01:44.104 --> 01:46.541
Architect?
Gastrointestinal surgeon?

01:46.584 --> 01:47.846
Female Ghostbuster?

01:47.890 --> 01:49.761
You're a high school-dropout.

01:49.805 --> 01:51.328
- With escort experience.

01:51.372 --> 01:53.983
- Under "employment history"
you've just listed movies

01:54.026 --> 01:55.724
you've seen in the theater.

01:55.767 --> 01:57.421
You saw "Homeward Bound" twice?

01:57.465 --> 01:59.945
- The dogs <i>and</i> cats talk in it.

01:59.989 --> 02:02.687
- The app requires
a Florida thumbprint?

02:02.731 --> 02:04.211
- Ugh.

02:04.254 --> 02:05.255
There we are.

02:11.957 --> 02:13.829
Oh, no!

02:13.872 --> 02:15.178
Instead of arresting me,

02:15.222 --> 02:17.311
what do you say
I flash you for it, mm?

02:17.354 --> 02:19.051
- You have the right
to remain clothed.

02:19.095 --> 02:21.184
Any breasts you expose can
and will be held against you

02:21.228 --> 02:23.491
in a court of law.
- Ugh.

02:25.014 --> 02:26.885
- Your Honor,
my client is now aware

02:26.929 --> 02:29.540
that mermaids
aren't real -- ever.

02:29.584 --> 02:30.802
In addition, he's prepared

02:30.846 --> 02:32.456
to completely abstain
from energy drinks.

02:32.500 --> 02:34.893
- A misunderstanding
is what it was.

02:34.937 --> 02:36.895
- I'll dismiss the charges,
but you're not allowed

02:36.939 --> 02:38.810
within 1,000 feet of a manatee.

02:38.854 --> 02:41.552
Unless, of course,
it's over the age of consent.

02:41.596 --> 02:43.815
- Potential Felon 223.

02:43.859 --> 02:46.731
- Where's my lawyer?
- Did you download the app?

02:46.775 --> 02:48.211
- No?
- Oh, you should have.

02:48.255 --> 02:51.214
Trophy Fantasy, you have
numerous outstanding warrants.

02:51.258 --> 02:54.739
Petty theft, arson, lewd
behavior in a buffet restaurant.

02:54.783 --> 02:56.088
What say you in your defense?

02:56.132 --> 02:58.917
- I would like to present
into evidence --

02:58.961 --> 03:01.398
- You are hereby sentenced
to community service

03:01.442 --> 03:02.921
mentoring teen runaways.

03:02.965 --> 03:04.880
If you can scare them straight,
I'll waive your charges.

03:04.923 --> 03:06.447
If not, it's hard labor

03:06.490 --> 03:08.536
spell checking Dear Leader's
social media. Next!

03:08.579 --> 03:10.668
- But, your Hono-gram,
I'm no good with children.

03:10.712 --> 03:13.062
Plus I-I already am
a stay-at-home mom.

03:13.105 --> 03:15.543
My -- My daughter Annie
is the teen who needs me.

03:15.586 --> 03:17.632
- Does your daughter have
any exceptional needs?

03:17.675 --> 03:20.765
- She's <i>exceptionally</i> needy!
Or neglected?

03:20.809 --> 03:22.550
Uh, I forget which is which
is which is which.

03:22.593 --> 03:24.595
- Step forward.
Due to budget cuts,

03:24.639 --> 03:26.162
we've replaced parole officers

03:26.206 --> 03:27.946
with uptight,
underage tattletales.

03:27.990 --> 03:30.601
It's a pilot program
we're calling "Lil' PO."

03:30.645 --> 03:33.038
You a snitch?
- My gym teacher
who steals cigarettes

03:33.082 --> 03:35.476
from the sophomore she's having
sex with says I am.

03:35.519 --> 03:37.434
- Sold. You are hereby deputized

03:37.478 --> 03:39.654
by the franchise-territory
of Florida.

03:39.697 --> 03:42.265
I'm releasing your mother
into your recognizance.

03:42.309 --> 03:43.962
- Oh.

03:48.967 --> 03:51.970
- Mr. and Mrs. Cuddlefish,
feel free to take

03:52.014 --> 03:55.235
as long as you need
with your final good-byes.

03:55.278 --> 03:57.585
I see here you've ordered
Loki's cremains

03:57.628 --> 03:59.456
put inside the screen
of an iPad?

03:59.500 --> 04:03.330
- So we can keep playing
"Worried Geese" together.

04:03.373 --> 04:05.462
I won't let the quacks stop!

04:05.506 --> 04:07.421
- I don't know
how we'll get through

04:07.464 --> 04:09.336
this first night without him.

04:09.379 --> 04:11.512
It was always the three of us!

04:13.078 --> 04:16.560
- Pete, have Lester and I
told you how much

04:16.604 --> 04:18.432
you remind us of Loki?

04:18.475 --> 04:20.956
- You're practically his twin!

04:22.479 --> 04:24.525
- If there is anything I can do,

04:24.568 --> 04:26.875
you know our motto here
at Tender Endings.

04:29.269 --> 04:33.011
- Hmm. Could you possibly come
to our house tonight?

04:33.055 --> 04:34.491
- Of course.

04:34.535 --> 04:36.319
I believe your
Super Deluxe Package

04:36.363 --> 04:40.410
actually includes one in-home
grief counseling session.

04:41.716 --> 04:44.588
- The file said the runaways
are a three-person gang

04:44.632 --> 04:46.416
called the Killmore Girls.

04:46.460 --> 04:47.635
Good luck scaring them.

04:47.678 --> 04:50.594
They have a lot
of unresolved feelings.

04:50.638 --> 04:53.205
- You know, I also saw on TV
that moms should

04:53.249 --> 04:55.382
encourage their daughters
to confront their fears.

04:55.425 --> 04:56.557
It builds resilience.

04:56.600 --> 04:58.733
I'm gonna let you
handle the mentoring.

04:58.776 --> 04:59.690
- What?!

04:59.734 --> 05:01.344
- Ugh, this is so boring.
- Oh.

05:01.388 --> 05:04.565
- Um, hello, goth peers.

05:04.608 --> 05:07.785
I'm Annie, a registered Lil' PO.

05:07.829 --> 05:11.354
How about we go around and state
your name and why you're here?

05:11.398 --> 05:13.530
- I'm Infinitee, and I've killed.

05:13.574 --> 05:15.837
- I'm Eternitee, and I've killed.

05:15.880 --> 05:18.361
- I'm Monotonie, and I buried
the dead bodies.

05:18.405 --> 05:20.363
I'm a helper.
Is that a dead body?

05:20.407 --> 05:22.322
- She's undead, not dead.

05:22.365 --> 05:24.062
- Is this grammar?
I hate grammar.

05:24.106 --> 05:26.369
- We're actually gonna
begin the day with goals.

05:26.413 --> 05:28.110
What's a dream job
for each of you?

05:28.153 --> 05:32.332
I'll start -- I want to raise
peacocks as pets, not meat.

05:32.375 --> 05:34.203
- Hey, guys,
let's get out of here.

05:34.246 --> 05:37.337
This place has, like,
real second-chance energy.

05:37.380 --> 05:39.861
- Let's go stare at that lake
that's on fire.

05:39.904 --> 05:43.038
- Come back! Next, we get
to use pipe cleaners

05:43.081 --> 05:45.693
to express our insecurities!

05:45.736 --> 05:47.042
- I got this, hon.

05:47.085 --> 05:49.697
Yeah, that Annie girl <i>
is</i> super lame.

05:49.740 --> 05:53.222
Follow me. I know where we can
get some, like, food for free.

05:53.265 --> 05:56.312
- I'll bring the pipe cleaners
just in case there's a wait

05:56.356 --> 05:57.922
for a table of five.

05:59.794 --> 06:04.407
- It's going to take a <i>long</i> time
to process the loss of Loki,

06:04.451 --> 06:06.235
but that's why I'm here.

06:06.278 --> 06:07.410
- We were hoping
you would feel that way.

06:07.454 --> 06:09.543
- I find it best to not let go.

06:09.586 --> 06:11.458
Just keep holdin' on forever.

06:11.501 --> 06:14.286
Sorrow can last a lifetime,
if you do it right.

06:14.330 --> 06:18.116
- If you like those pictures,
you'll love the ones upstairs.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.643
- Wow!

06:22.686 --> 06:24.209
- Once your organs disintegrate,

06:24.253 --> 06:27.082
there's a lot more room
for hot dogs in there.

06:27.125 --> 06:28.953
- It's kind of hot,
in a gross way.

06:28.997 --> 06:31.652
- You really did used to be
like us -- but better.

06:31.695 --> 06:34.437
- You make me nostalgic
for my wild teen years.

06:34.481 --> 06:37.005
Maybe my resurrection
is also a second chance

06:37.048 --> 06:38.528
to have adolescent fun?

06:38.572 --> 06:41.183
Because first time,
I squandered my life.

06:41.226 --> 06:45.187
Got caught up
in nihilism and despair.

06:45.230 --> 06:46.231
- Nice mentoring.

06:46.275 --> 06:47.929
Connecting with
their despondence

06:47.972 --> 06:49.539
by talking about your suicide.

06:49.583 --> 06:53.369
Really brave.
- No, I mean my teen pregnancy.

06:53.413 --> 06:55.806
Girls, no matter
how bad you screw up,

06:55.850 --> 06:59.331
there's no mistake you can't
"talk" your way out of --

06:59.375 --> 07:01.769
unless you keep the baby.

07:01.812 --> 07:05.076
- I'd only want one
if it could be like that
doll from "Child's Play."

07:05.120 --> 07:07.688
- Trophy? Quick word in private?

07:07.731 --> 07:09.080
- No secrets, Annie.

07:09.124 --> 07:10.473
Don't be rude to the gang.

07:10.517 --> 07:12.606
- How am I the worst mistake
of your life?

07:12.649 --> 07:14.869
You left town three days
after you gave birth!

07:14.912 --> 07:17.088
And you once joined
a CrossFit gym

07:17.132 --> 07:18.481
that harvested your kidney!

07:18.525 --> 07:20.265
- Why you gotta be such
a buzzkill to your sister?

07:20.309 --> 07:22.746
- She's my mother!
- If she never mothered you,

07:22.790 --> 07:24.400
seems more like
she's your sister to me.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.533
- Sorry, I need to
close out your tab.

07:26.576 --> 07:28.230
You've ordered the maximum
number of hot dogs

07:28.273 --> 07:30.493
we're legally allowed
to serve to a group of women.

07:30.537 --> 07:33.322
You're welcome back later
with a male chaperone.

07:33.365 --> 07:35.977
- We're not paying.
Watch this.

07:37.195 --> 07:39.284
Death powers.

07:43.898 --> 07:45.682
- Did those beetles
come out of her --

07:45.726 --> 07:47.945
- It's better not to
think about it.
- But I want to.

07:47.989 --> 07:50.513
I may have just figured out
my dream job.

07:50.557 --> 07:51.645
- Hey!

07:56.867 --> 08:00.915
- That's my favorite portrait
of the three of us.

08:00.958 --> 08:02.786
- You slept together?

08:02.830 --> 08:04.353
- Absolutely.

08:04.396 --> 08:06.790
- We know it's not
traditional, but --

08:06.834 --> 08:08.139
- Say no more.

08:08.183 --> 08:11.534
Parenting, like grief,
takes many forms.

08:11.578 --> 08:12.970
- Loki wasn't our son.

08:13.014 --> 08:14.015
He was our lover.

08:14.058 --> 08:16.147
The three of us were a triad.

08:16.191 --> 08:17.714
Have you ever heard
of polyamory?

08:17.758 --> 08:19.847
- Oh, it's time
to renew our vows.

08:19.890 --> 08:22.545
- Once the divorce rate
topped 90%, Florida decided

08:22.589 --> 08:25.548
to make marriages auto-expire
every 24 hours.

08:25.592 --> 08:26.810
- You just use the app.

08:26.854 --> 08:28.769
- We were married
for almost a decade.

08:28.812 --> 08:30.640
But now, without
a third person...

08:30.684 --> 08:32.860
it's like the vows
have lost all meaning.

08:32.903 --> 08:35.776
- Like the Pledge of Allegiance,
or an MFA.

08:35.819 --> 08:37.604
- <i>Please
complete vows in 30 seconds </i>

08:37.647 --> 08:39.083
<i>to remain lawfully wed.</i>

08:39.127 --> 08:41.608
30, 29...
- Won't you join us, Pete?

08:41.651 --> 08:45.568
- Till death or 24 hours
from now do us part.

08:45.612 --> 08:49.616
- I think it would really
help us with our mourning.

08:49.659 --> 08:52.706
- One really shouldn't
make hasty decisions

08:52.749 --> 08:54.229
after the death of a loved one,

08:54.272 --> 08:56.623
but rebound weddings
are included

08:56.666 --> 08:58.538
in the Super Deluxe Package.

08:58.581 --> 08:59.800
My idea.

08:59.843 --> 09:01.802
- Throw! Throw! Throw!

09:01.845 --> 09:03.586
- Oh!
- Here it goes!

09:03.630 --> 09:05.414
Huegh!

09:05.457 --> 09:06.850
- Take that society!

09:06.894 --> 09:09.505
- Okay, G-8-T-R-6-9-R.
- Whee!

09:09.549 --> 09:11.812
- Why are you writing down
license plate numbers?
- Hah! Take that!

09:11.855 --> 09:13.683
- So we can send apology notes.
- Yeah!

09:13.727 --> 09:16.251
- Or hand-deliver.
I don't think we can
afford this many stamps.

09:16.294 --> 09:18.601
- Ear popper?
Helps with anxiety.

09:18.645 --> 09:20.211
- You suffer from anxiety?

09:20.255 --> 09:23.301
- Yeah, fear of getting last
place in wet T-shirt contests.

09:23.345 --> 09:25.695
You know, it happens
to good people every day.

09:25.739 --> 09:27.610
- Wet T-shirt contest!

09:29.003 --> 09:31.875
- Trophy, as your Lil' PO,
I demand you --

09:31.919 --> 09:34.704
- Somebody's gotta be last place!
- Auuugh!

09:34.748 --> 09:36.619
- Ugh! Seriously?!

09:36.663 --> 09:38.621
If I weren't wearing
a rubber undershirt,

09:38.665 --> 09:40.144
I'd be soaked to the bone.

09:40.188 --> 09:42.233
If you'd rather pretend
to be a teenager

09:42.277 --> 09:45.454
with these screw-ups than spend
time with me, fine!

09:45.497 --> 09:48.631
Enjoy being a slave
in a social media sweatshop.

09:48.675 --> 09:50.938
- Trophy! Let's put some T-shirts
on some roadkill

09:50.981 --> 09:52.635
and get them wet!

09:56.987 --> 09:59.642
- Who even does
wet T-shirt contests anymore?

09:59.686 --> 10:02.079
That's, like, so male-gaze.

10:02.123 --> 10:06.301
Exposing your breasts is not
a successful life strategy.

10:07.302 --> 10:08.520
You're okay, Annie.

10:08.564 --> 10:11.001
Fear of abandonment
is character building.

10:11.045 --> 10:14.483
Unlike my fear of zippers,
which I just need to work on.

10:15.919 --> 10:18.487
- Get in quick before
the police find us.

10:25.581 --> 10:27.235
- Girls, I'm Mrs. Clomid.

10:27.278 --> 10:29.498
I run a place that helps
young women like you --

10:29.541 --> 10:31.805
in need of support or escape.

10:31.848 --> 10:33.937
Good thing I keep
my police scanner on

10:33.981 --> 10:36.679
as I drive around town
picking up teen girls

10:36.723 --> 10:38.376
thrown away by their families.

10:38.420 --> 10:39.813
- Oh, I'm not a runaway.

10:39.856 --> 10:42.729
I'm related to Trophy --
through birth.

10:42.772 --> 10:45.209
She's easily distracted, but...
- Again. Again.

10:45.253 --> 10:46.907
- ...deep down, she loves me.

10:46.950 --> 10:48.038
Pretty sure.

10:48.082 --> 10:51.520
- Now you're officially
a Killmore Girl.

10:51.563 --> 10:52.347
- Yes!

10:54.131 --> 10:56.525
- Feel free to enjoy
the amenities, girls.

10:56.568 --> 10:58.614
Whirlpool, free pedicures...

10:58.658 --> 11:00.529
- Here it goes!
- ...chicken pox vaccines.

11:00.572 --> 11:02.487
Come on!
- Oh!

11:02.531 --> 11:03.663
- Whoo!
- What fun!

11:03.706 --> 11:05.795
- Is there somewhere I
can sit quietly

11:05.839 --> 11:07.710
until they tire themselves out?

11:07.754 --> 11:09.277
- I want to show you
the amenities

11:09.320 --> 11:11.235
I think you'll appreciate.

11:11.279 --> 11:12.628
This way.

11:14.325 --> 11:16.414
I could tell from
the first moment I saw you

11:16.458 --> 11:18.068
that you're special.

11:18.112 --> 11:20.723
I think you'll feel
right at home here.

11:20.767 --> 11:22.464
Here's where we all
sit down together

11:22.507 --> 11:26.381
for a home-cooked dinner
each night -- family style.

11:27.512 --> 11:30.428
- What is..."family style"?

11:30.472 --> 11:33.214
- My uterus is curious.

11:33.257 --> 11:35.042
My choice...

11:35.085 --> 11:36.217
...Rolls Royce.

11:36.260 --> 11:39.699
Old man's baby?
Yes, they'll pay me.

11:40.482 --> 11:42.919
- First time here?
Are you pre or post?

11:42.963 --> 11:44.878
- Oh, um, I --
I'm just getting the tour.

11:44.921 --> 11:47.228
- I'm gonna use the money
to pay for Stanford.

11:47.271 --> 11:48.403
Then, I'll launch my app.

11:48.446 --> 11:50.840
It's like Tinder
but for plane tickets.

11:50.884 --> 11:52.537
- Ooh.
- Let's go to my office

11:52.581 --> 11:55.671
and talk about
your growth potential.

11:58.456 --> 12:00.023
- Mm.
- There!

12:00.067 --> 12:03.200
- You complete us, Pete.
Shall we toast?

12:06.377 --> 12:08.292
- Oh! I should take this.

12:08.336 --> 12:10.207
I'll be right back.

12:10.251 --> 12:11.774
- Petey, where are you?

12:11.818 --> 12:13.080
We work now.

12:13.123 --> 12:14.429
- I'm with the Cuddlefishes.

12:14.472 --> 12:17.301
They've asked me to share
their lives with them,

12:17.345 --> 12:19.956
and I think I'm...happy?

12:20.000 --> 12:22.263
- Yeah, remember
last time you happy.

12:22.306 --> 12:23.786
You saw a sunset,

12:23.830 --> 12:25.396
and we nearly
went out of business!

12:25.440 --> 12:27.529
- Oh, yeah --
the time I realized

12:27.572 --> 12:30.706
that the world was so big
and so beautiful.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.316
I wish people didn't get
so weirded out

12:32.360 --> 12:34.188
when you grin
while burying their family.

12:34.231 --> 12:37.321
- Ah-hah. Petey, remember mother?

12:37.365 --> 12:39.062
What does she know?

12:39.106 --> 12:40.411
- She know best.

12:40.455 --> 12:42.370
- And what does mother want?

12:42.413 --> 12:44.198
- For Pete to stop being happy

12:44.241 --> 12:46.200
and start being
a sad undertaker?

12:46.243 --> 12:47.505
- Good boy.

12:47.549 --> 12:50.813
- God, she's brilliant!

12:53.120 --> 12:55.470
- What it do?
The Duplass Brothers,

12:55.513 --> 12:57.602
Morgan Freeman, Scrooge McDuck,

12:57.646 --> 13:00.127
That Guy Who Drops the Chili
on NBC's "The Office" --

13:00.170 --> 13:02.172
what do they all have in common?

13:02.216 --> 13:03.347
They all want to have kids,

13:03.391 --> 13:05.349
but their sperms
are too damn old!

13:05.393 --> 13:08.309
Holla! It would be illegal
and disgusting for them

13:08.352 --> 13:09.919
to actually have sex with you,

13:09.963 --> 13:12.835
but your teenaged eggs
are the best money can buy!

13:12.879 --> 13:15.620
F-F-F-Feoow! So, what's up?
Here's the tea!

13:15.664 --> 13:17.927
At birth, you simply twerk away
your parental rights.

13:17.971 --> 13:19.842
You'll get the future
you deserve had your parents

13:19.886 --> 13:22.062
loved you more or been
rich enough to buy your succe--

13:22.105 --> 13:24.760
- You get the drift.
May I speak candidly?

13:24.804 --> 13:27.632
You remind me of myself
when I was your age.

13:27.676 --> 13:30.505
- Your mom abandoned you,
killed herself, got reanimated,

13:30.548 --> 13:32.420
and rather than use
her second chance at life

13:32.463 --> 13:35.075
to be the kind of mother
you deserve, she used it

13:35.118 --> 13:36.946
to refine her skin regimen?

13:36.990 --> 13:38.905
- No.

13:38.948 --> 13:41.385
But Mom did come late
to one of my swim meets.

13:41.429 --> 13:46.869
Now I think of every girl here
as one of my very own daughters.

13:46.913 --> 13:49.480
Care for some hot cocoa?

13:50.612 --> 13:52.092
- So, you live in luxury,

13:52.135 --> 13:53.397
get a wad of cash
after the birth,

13:53.441 --> 13:56.052
and don't have to raise
the -- ugh -- baby?

13:56.096 --> 13:57.793
Sign me up!
- Yeah, me too!

13:57.837 --> 13:59.664
- Ladies.

13:59.708 --> 14:02.885
- Girls, you're forgetting
everything I've taught you.

14:02.929 --> 14:05.148
Pregnancy means
the party's over!

14:05.192 --> 14:07.542
- It's 40,000 Flori-dollars
a pop, Grandma.

14:07.585 --> 14:09.370
- They're low-balling you.

14:09.413 --> 14:10.937
- I'm sorry.
None of you qualify.

14:10.980 --> 14:13.113
I'll need to ask you to leave.
- Huh? Why?

14:13.156 --> 14:15.855
- Well, Eternitee,
you're already pregnant.

14:15.898 --> 14:16.986
- Can't I get double-pregnant?

14:17.030 --> 14:18.901
- No.
- I'll show you!

14:18.945 --> 14:20.598
- Infinitee, your drug screening

14:20.642 --> 14:22.165
shows you've been
doing ear whippets

14:22.209 --> 14:25.342
as recently as, eh, today.

14:25.386 --> 14:27.388
- I have anxiety!

14:27.431 --> 14:29.781
- And Monotonie -- sadly,
you're disqualified

14:29.825 --> 14:32.088
because Senator Casey Anthony
intervened.

14:32.132 --> 14:34.308
- God! My mom never stops
ruining my life.

14:34.351 --> 14:36.310
I hate her!
- God, I know what you mean.

14:36.353 --> 14:38.399
Hey, where's Annie?

14:40.270 --> 14:43.752
How did my story about having
her not scare her straight?

14:43.795 --> 14:45.928
Plus, she'll never
give up the baby!

14:45.972 --> 14:47.712
She can't even throw away
chicken bones.

14:47.756 --> 14:50.802
She and my brother make
these googley-eyed sculptures.

14:50.846 --> 14:52.413
They're -- They're
really chilling.

14:52.456 --> 14:53.631
- So, we ditch her.

14:53.675 --> 14:55.982
Let's go on a Killmore Girls
crime spree!

14:56.025 --> 14:58.071
- We should rob a Chick-fil-A.

14:58.114 --> 15:01.683
They're, like, problematic.
- You don't understand.

15:01.726 --> 15:03.598
We have to go help Annie!

15:03.641 --> 15:06.557
You want me to rescue her
all by myself?!

15:06.601 --> 15:07.994
What am I, he-- her mother?!

15:08.037 --> 15:09.952
- There's, like, a resemblance.

15:09.996 --> 15:11.388
- Rrrrgh.
- Bye-bye.

15:11.432 --> 15:15.827
- Even when I am wearing
this tiny hat?!

15:15.871 --> 15:19.744
Rrrgh!
- Oh, no. Telekinesis?

15:19.788 --> 15:22.965
You're not scary.
- Oh, wow. That's impressive.

15:23.009 --> 15:25.446
Like, dead, undead.

15:25.489 --> 15:26.795
Make up your mind already.

15:26.838 --> 15:29.232
- Okay. You wanna be scared?

15:29.276 --> 15:32.714
I'll show you your own
pathetic deaths

15:32.757 --> 15:34.150
if you don't change your ways.

15:34.194 --> 15:36.979
Monotonie, if you don't
turn your life around,

15:37.023 --> 15:38.981
you're gonna die hitchhiking

15:39.025 --> 15:40.678
when a trucker accidentally
runs you over

15:40.722 --> 15:43.986
as he's pulling off the road
with plans to <i>murder</i> you.

15:44.030 --> 15:45.640
- Hmm. Complicated much?

15:45.683 --> 15:47.685
- Oh, I'm sorry.
Hard to follow?

15:47.729 --> 15:50.166
Infinitee, you're gonna drown

15:50.210 --> 15:52.952
during this weekend's
wet T-shirt contest!

15:52.995 --> 15:54.605
- What place am I in
when I drown?

15:54.649 --> 15:57.043
- 7th.
- Out of how many?

15:57.086 --> 16:00.785
- Seven! And Eternitee,
for you, it's death

16:00.829 --> 16:03.440
by wasabi Brazil nut!

16:04.833 --> 16:07.009
- That's it.

16:07.053 --> 16:08.402
You're out of the gang.

16:08.445 --> 16:11.492
- I've never even been
to Wasabi, Brazil.

16:11.535 --> 16:13.320
This is so boring.
- Fine!

16:13.363 --> 16:17.106
I'll rescue Annie
from a life-destroying
decision without you!

16:17.150 --> 16:20.240
Oh, but a quick spray-tan
first wouldn't hurt.

16:22.764 --> 16:24.418
- Everything okay?

16:24.461 --> 16:25.854
- Hey, where are my clothes?

16:25.897 --> 16:28.770
- Oh, that
Soviet-era janitor jumpsuit

16:28.813 --> 16:31.773
with a decaying sandwich inside?

16:31.816 --> 16:33.514
I tossed it.

16:33.557 --> 16:35.037
- Augh! Oh!

16:35.081 --> 16:37.387
- We'll get you
a whole new wardrobe.

16:37.431 --> 16:38.823
We loved spoiling Loki.

16:38.867 --> 16:41.304
But, since he tragically died
in a VR grease fire,

16:41.348 --> 16:42.827
we're here to spoil you.

16:42.871 --> 16:44.220
- Decaying things aren't just

16:44.264 --> 16:46.222
my life's purpose --
they're my passion!

16:46.266 --> 16:50.183
Baba's right -- you and I
have different priorities.

16:50.226 --> 16:51.358
- But -- But our --

16:51.401 --> 16:53.534
our only priority
is your happiness, Pete!

16:53.577 --> 16:55.753
- I'm afraid that's not
going to work for me.

16:55.797 --> 16:57.451
Goodbye, Cuddlefishes.

16:57.494 --> 16:59.018
This was cute.

17:01.411 --> 17:03.065
- So, um, how does this work?

17:03.109 --> 17:04.893
Are there stirrups, or --

17:04.936 --> 17:06.634
- You just swallow this pill.

17:06.677 --> 17:08.505
You're instantly impregnated

17:08.549 --> 17:11.073
with the sperm
of anonymous donor

17:11.117 --> 17:13.119
Sir Rod Stewart.

17:13.162 --> 17:16.078
You'll make
a great vessel, Annie.

17:16.122 --> 17:19.255
- Wow. I've never felt
this cared for.

17:19.299 --> 17:21.736
- Take the pill,
and you can feel that way

17:21.779 --> 17:23.651
for nine more months.

17:23.694 --> 17:25.392
- Annie, don't do it!

17:25.435 --> 17:28.047
Teen pregnancy isn't all
baby footprint tattoos,

17:28.090 --> 17:29.918
reality shows,
and murder trials.

17:29.961 --> 17:32.399
It has a human cost.
- Leave me alone!

17:32.442 --> 17:34.618
Mrs. Clomid knows
what's best for me.

17:34.662 --> 17:37.447
She made me hot cocoa --
with sprinkles!

17:37.491 --> 17:38.927
- Damn, she's good.

17:38.970 --> 17:40.494
I should have been
the beverage equivalent

17:40.537 --> 17:42.104
of the world's best hot cocoa.

17:42.148 --> 17:45.020
but life filled your "Mom" mug
with an undead can

17:45.064 --> 17:46.108
of flat Malt liquor.

17:46.152 --> 17:48.371
I want to do better.

17:51.461 --> 17:53.724
- Annie's in our care now.

17:53.768 --> 17:57.772
Inseminees aren't allowed
to leave the premises.

17:57.815 --> 18:01.906
Trophy, please say
your goodbyes.

18:01.950 --> 18:03.560
- I'm not leaving you
to be raised

18:03.604 --> 18:06.346
by a well-meaning
old woman again!

18:06.389 --> 18:07.825
- Why? You seem to prefer

18:07.869 --> 18:10.959
vapid-hot dog-criminal time
to mother-daughter time.

18:11.002 --> 18:13.135
- You're right.
I don't deserve a smart,

18:13.179 --> 18:14.528
responsible daughter like you.

18:14.571 --> 18:17.661
But this is my second chance --
and yours, too.

18:17.705 --> 18:20.099
You should have some
carefree fun for a change,

18:20.142 --> 18:23.276
and I should embrace tedium
and misery like a real adult.

18:23.319 --> 18:26.714
Don't get pregnant till you're
actually ready to be a parent,

18:26.757 --> 18:29.847
because you'll be a great one.

18:29.891 --> 18:30.892
Death powers.

18:30.935 --> 18:32.241
- I think I've made
a big mistake.

18:32.285 --> 18:34.200
- "Big Mistake"
is my middle name.

18:34.243 --> 18:36.071
Legally. Thanks, Baba.

18:36.115 --> 18:37.159
- I wanna get out of here.

18:37.203 --> 18:38.682
- You got it.

18:38.726 --> 18:42.208
Let's run away
together this time.

18:42.251 --> 18:45.167
- Oh, you smell like gasoline
and popcorn.

18:45.211 --> 18:47.038
- It's the spray tan.

18:51.042 --> 18:52.479
Hey, fertile freaks!

18:52.522 --> 18:54.655
Help us sneak out of here,
I'll show you my knockers!

18:54.698 --> 18:56.787
- I've got this.
Girls, I'm desperate.

18:56.831 --> 18:59.225
I have an interview with Harvard
in half an hour,

18:59.268 --> 19:00.443
and they won't let me leave.

19:00.487 --> 19:02.141
If I miss it,
I'll have to go to Vassar.

19:02.184 --> 19:04.099
- Oh, my God, say no more.

19:04.143 --> 19:08.147
Sarah, Operation Safety School!

19:10.845 --> 19:12.890
- I just finished
my Lil' PO self-assessment,

19:12.934 --> 19:14.849
and I think I have to
turn us both in.

19:14.892 --> 19:17.634
- You are a little snitch.
- The rules were clear.

19:17.678 --> 19:20.159
You had to help the runaways,
and I had to supervise.

19:20.202 --> 19:21.377
We both failed.

19:21.421 --> 19:23.336
Together.

19:24.163 --> 19:25.512
- What are you doing here?

19:25.555 --> 19:27.470
- Right after we left
the preggo dork mansion,

19:27.514 --> 19:31.387
Eternitee was killed
by a wasabi Brazil nut,

19:31.431 --> 19:33.128
just like you predicted.

19:33.172 --> 19:35.217
- Oh, my gosh.
She was allergic?

19:35.261 --> 19:36.827
- No, I threw it off
the overpass

19:36.871 --> 19:38.046
and hit her in the skull.

19:38.089 --> 19:39.439
It was hilarious.

19:39.482 --> 19:41.180
- But it made us realize
you were right, Trophy.

19:41.223 --> 19:43.051
- We went to the judge
to confess our crimes

19:43.094 --> 19:46.315
and he said, "Due to budget
cuts, wanna be sexy cops?"

19:46.359 --> 19:49.231
Now we're SXPD. Duh.

19:49.275 --> 19:51.625
- That means I did
scare you straight.

19:51.668 --> 19:55.933
Well, except for Eternitee.
- Yep, you're officially free.

19:55.977 --> 19:57.196
- Then, why are you here?

19:57.239 --> 19:59.459
- We have an arrest warrant
for you, Annie.

19:59.502 --> 20:01.809
Says you're harboring
a stolen fetus.

20:01.852 --> 20:03.463
- You leave Annie alone,

20:03.506 --> 20:05.682
or I'll send out the beetles
to cover your feet

20:05.726 --> 20:07.989
so it looks like
you're wearing sensible shoes.

20:08.032 --> 20:09.469
- A slip-on clog mule?!

20:09.512 --> 20:12.385
Guh, we'll be kicked off
the SXPD force!

20:12.428 --> 20:14.213
- I guess we could
tell them Annie died.

20:14.256 --> 20:16.389
- From a wasabi Brazil nut!

20:16.432 --> 20:18.478
Those deaths tend
to happen in pairs.

20:18.521 --> 20:20.088
Bye-bye.

20:20.131 --> 20:21.176
- Get shower, Pete.

20:21.220 --> 20:22.873
Now you need to marry Trophy.

20:22.917 --> 20:25.049
- I'm still married
to the Cuddlefishes.

20:25.093 --> 20:27.138
For at least a few more hours.

20:27.182 --> 20:30.316
- Married?
You sell a Super Deluxe?

20:30.359 --> 20:33.101
- Let's just put that funeral
behind us, shall we?

20:33.144 --> 20:34.407
Anyone feeling hungry?

20:34.450 --> 20:37.148
We could cook a family-style.
- Maybe tomorrow.

20:37.192 --> 20:39.150
Tonight, we deserve
a special treat!

20:39.194 --> 20:40.848
- I already had my special treat.

20:40.891 --> 20:45.722
It was learning
I don't deserve happiness.

20:45.766 --> 20:47.202
- Ummm, Baba.

20:47.246 --> 20:48.769
I have to tell you something.

20:48.812 --> 20:51.641
Long story, but I'm pregnant.

20:51.685 --> 20:56.080
- Don't worry, I "bought" you
a morning-after hot dog.

20:56.124 --> 20:58.648
- You did?
- I think I'm
really getting the hang

20:58.692 --> 21:01.390
of this mother/daughter thing.

21:01.434 --> 21:03.349
- Sorry, little
Sir Roderick Stewart.

21:03.392 --> 21:06.874
- And if no work,
I have secret family recipe.

21:06.917 --> 21:08.789
Only fail me one time.

21:11.139 --> 21:14.142
Biggest mistake of my life.
