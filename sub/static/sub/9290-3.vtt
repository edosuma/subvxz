00:12.000 --> 00:14.208
"Previously on" 24.

00:14.304 --> 00:16.385
What if I can get us a copy
of Keeler's playbook?

00:16.481 --> 00:19.233
What exactly do you mean by playbook?

00:19.329 --> 00:22.371
- His entire prep for tonight's debate.
- I" "told you to drop that."

00:22.466 --> 00:25.505
- "You just listen to me."
There is something you need to see.
- There's nothing I need to see.

00:25.602 --> 00:28.547
It's about Anne. It's something
that we didn't know about her.

00:28.642 --> 00:31.107
Something that could
damage all of us.

00:31.202 --> 00:35.140
- Can I talk to you now?
- " Yeah, of course. Okay, what's up?"

00:35.235 --> 00:37.636
Chase and I have been
going out for awhile.

00:37.731 --> 00:41.157
And it's starting to get serious.
I really care for him, Dad.

00:41.252 --> 00:44.517
- So, what do you think?
- I don't know what I think.

00:44.612 --> 00:47.845
We want the release of Ramon Salazar.

00:47.942 --> 00:51.718
If you refuse to comply,
the virus will be unleashed.

00:51.815 --> 00:54.310
It looks like the virus was
delivered in a crystalline form.

00:54.407 --> 00:56.646
Maybe what you're
looking for is a white powder.

00:56.742 --> 01:00.295
- It would look like a bag of cocaine or heroin?
- That may even be the strategy.

01:00.391 --> 01:03.976
Someone thinks they're selling a bag of coke,
when in fact, they're handling the virus.

01:04.072 --> 01:09.000
- "Where did you get that money?"
- "It doesn't matter."
Okay, we needed it. I got it.

01:09.097 --> 01:12.041
So this is how you're gonna help
your family, by dealing drugs?

01:12.137 --> 01:14.378
I'm not dealing 'em.
It's a stupid delivery.

01:14.473 --> 01:16.395
If that kid's walking around
with a bag of cocaine...

01:16.490 --> 01:18.313
that's got the virus in it,
and he doesn't know it?

01:18.411 --> 01:20.682
I need to find him and stop him
from putting it into circulation.

01:20.779 --> 01:24.428
You didn't shoot up, did you? What?
You think you can hide it from me?

01:24.523 --> 01:27.947
- "I'm not trying to hide it from you."
I'm trying to quit.
- People don't just quit, Jack.

01:28.042 --> 01:30.700
I am not going on record with this
addiction. Do you understand me?

01:30.796 --> 01:33.420
You're the only person who knows about it.
It's gonna stay that way.

01:33.516 --> 01:36.397
- Give me an update.
- Kyle's still in his house.

01:36.492 --> 01:38.861
- What about the package?
- "It's with him."

01:38.957 --> 01:41.582
- "And Ramon?"
- "Just waiting to come home."

01:41.678 --> 01:44.046
Good.

01:53.649 --> 01:57.520
The following takes place
between 3.'00 p.m. And 4.'00 p.m.

02:02.928 --> 02:05.233
Adam, have you downloaded
everyone's folders for the meeting?

02:05.330 --> 02:07.570
Not yet. I'm still pulling up some
medical details about the virus.

02:07.665 --> 02:09.745
Don't waste a lot of time.
The only thing our people need to know...

02:09.841 --> 02:13.907
is that it kills within 24 hours of exposure,
and we believe Kyle Singer has it.

02:14.003 --> 02:15.986
I got all that.
What about our approach to Singer?

02:16.083 --> 02:19.252
Jack's gonna meet Nicole Duncan,
head of Health Services, Los Angeles.

02:19.347 --> 02:23.572
They're gonna take a HazMat team over to
Singer's apartment. He's waiting for it now.

03:21.021 --> 03:23.645
Son of a bitch!

03:35.551 --> 03:40.064
- Hey, Jack. How ya doing?
- I'm okay, Nicole. How've you been?

03:40.159 --> 03:43.392
Until this afternoon,
I was doing fine.

03:43.487 --> 03:48.162
You know, I, um, I tried to reach you
after I heard about Teri.

03:49.216 --> 03:51.521
Yeah, I know.

03:51.617 --> 03:55.138
After that I kind of withdrew.
But I appreciated the calls. Thanks.

03:56.578 --> 03:58.818
We should get going.

04:06.340 --> 04:09.252
I just finished running
Macer's epidemiological model.

04:09.347 --> 04:11.620
- Her estimates were off.
- Better or worse than we thought?

04:11.716 --> 04:16.164
Twice as bad. She had nine percent of
the population infected within a week...

04:16.261 --> 04:18.372
but it's closer to 20%.

04:18.471 --> 04:21.221
And the infection-to-mortality rate
is higher than her estimate.

04:21.317 --> 04:23.782
Almost 95% lethal.

04:26.247 --> 04:29.670
I've been hunting germs for 12 years,
and I've never seen anything like this.

04:29.766 --> 04:31.656
Great.

04:34.760 --> 04:36.809
Are you feeling okay?

04:36.905 --> 04:38.729
Yeah. Why?

04:38.825 --> 04:41.512
You're perspiring.

04:43.177 --> 04:45.065
Oh, it's been nonstop since noon.

04:47.945 --> 04:50.250
Look, we're gonna be
about eight minutes out.

04:50.346 --> 04:52.971
It'd be great if we could go over the
quarantine protocols before we get there.

04:55.979 --> 04:59.691
- No problem.
- Good.

04:59.787 --> 05:04.397
If you refuse
to comply, the virus will be unleashed.

05:06.413 --> 05:08.973
We want the release
of Ramon Salazar...

05:09.069 --> 05:12.237
- "in the next six hours."
- Gael, here, take a look at this.

05:12.332 --> 05:14.927
We're closing in on the point
of origin of this call.

05:16.686 --> 05:19.118
- You see this code artifact here?
- Yeah.

05:19.213 --> 05:21.103
I found a few more in this recording.

05:21.199 --> 05:23.375
I think it's coming from
a domestic switching node.

05:23.471 --> 05:26.288
You think the call was made
from inside the U. S?

05:26.383 --> 05:29.520
Maybe. I'm piping it over to your system.

05:29.616 --> 05:31.569
- See if you can find a match.
- Okay.

05:31.665 --> 05:34.321
- But do it after the meeting.
- What meeting?

05:34.417 --> 05:37.520
Tony's shifting resources
to help Jack in the field.

05:37.618 --> 05:39.537
He's closing in on the virus.

05:43.731 --> 05:47.123
Gael. Jack needs that audio feed in place
when he gets to Kyle Singer's apartment.

05:47.218 --> 05:49.908
Tony needs me to take care of something.
I'll get it to you after the meeting.

05:50.003 --> 05:52.467
I need it before the meeting.
Jack's on his way there, so come do it now...

05:52.564 --> 05:55.861
I can't. Stop bugging me.
I'll get it to you.

05:56.917 --> 05:58.997
Fine.

06:12.374 --> 06:15.607
Have you thought about how it
will be when Ramon comes back?

06:15.704 --> 06:19.127
How it will be?
Like it was before.

06:19.223 --> 06:21.752
Things have changed, Hector.

06:21.848 --> 06:25.624
Nothing's changed.
He's only been gone three months.

06:25.752 --> 06:27.833
You've changed.

06:27.929 --> 06:31.001
You've been in charge
while he's been in prison.

06:31.098 --> 06:33.338
Are you willing to
give that up so easily?

06:39.675 --> 06:43.451
What is it?

06:43.546 --> 06:46.684
Bauer's telling C.T.U.
He's about to intercept the package.

06:46.779 --> 06:48.732
- How?
- I'm not sure. I'm about to find out.

06:48.828 --> 06:51.485
- Is Gomez still on Kyle Singer?
- Of course.

06:51.580 --> 06:54.588
Then we're fine.

07:09.599 --> 07:11.487
Hey, how was the interview?

07:14.560 --> 07:16.448
Fine.

07:20.289 --> 07:22.753
What's up, Dad?

07:22.849 --> 07:25.441
Your mother told me
you paid the rent.

07:26.529 --> 07:28.834
All three months we owed?

07:28.931 --> 07:31.363
Yeah, I came into a little money.

07:33.058 --> 07:36.931
How does a 19-year-old kid who doesn't
have a job come into a little money?

07:39.876 --> 07:43.268
Tim and I, we went... we went down
to the track the other day.

07:43.364 --> 07:45.797
He knows this guy over
at the stable, so, uh...

07:45.893 --> 07:48.293
- we got a tip.
- Where did you get the money?

07:48.389 --> 07:50.565
Dad, what does it matter?

07:50.661 --> 07:55.845
Honestly, the rent's paid for three months,
all right? The pressure's off us now.

07:55.943 --> 07:58.535
Did you do something illegal?

07:59.592 --> 08:01.543
No.

08:01.639 --> 08:04.680
I told you. We went to Santa Anita,
and we got lucky.

08:04.775 --> 08:07.144
- I-I didn't do anything illegal.
- Don't lie to me.

08:07.272 --> 08:10.601
I got enough to worry about.
Now this is my house.

08:10.729 --> 08:14.056
I pay the rent.
I take care of you and your mother.

08:15.752 --> 08:19.018
And when you get that job,
you go ahead and pay me back, all right?

08:19.114 --> 08:21.833
- Wait a second. We're not done here!
- No, we're done here.

08:21.931 --> 08:24.715
- Don't walk away from me!
- You should be thanking me
instead of crawling up my ass.

08:24.810 --> 08:27.980
Kyle! Kyle!

08:28.076 --> 08:30.891
"Open the door! Open the door!"

08:32.940 --> 08:36.653
His name is Kyle Singer.
We think he's transporting the virus...

08:36.748 --> 08:38.988
although it's likely he doesn't
realize what he's carrying.

08:39.085 --> 08:40.909
How could he not know?

08:41.005 --> 08:43.885
Health Services believes that the virus
was made to look like heroin or cocaine.

08:43.981 --> 08:47.373
We know Kyle Singer was hired
to deliver a package from Mexico
to a dealer in Los Angeles.

08:47.471 --> 08:51.342
- He thinks he's smuggling drugs.
- "That's the working theory."

08:51.438 --> 08:54.191
Now here's the thing...
once Singer delivers that bag of powder...

08:54.287 --> 08:56.111
it gets cut up and distributed
throughout the city.

08:56.207 --> 08:59.824
- "At that point, it becomes"
impossible to contain.
- Is L.A.P.D. Grabbing Singer?

08:59.919 --> 09:02.865
- No.
- "Why not? Can't they get there faster?"

09:02.960 --> 09:04.946
L.A.P.D.'s not trained
to handle a hot zone.

09:05.041 --> 09:07.057
Jack Bauer is gonna go in
with a team from Health Services.

09:07.152 --> 09:10.770
We're gonna run the operation from here,
updating the president in real time.

09:10.865 --> 09:13.970
Now we have to approach
Singer with care.

09:14.066 --> 09:17.330
He has no idea
how deadly the powder is.

09:17.428 --> 09:19.251
What's going on, Sam?

09:19.347 --> 09:21.747
- " Kyle locked himself in his room."
- "Did you two fight again?"

09:21.874 --> 09:25.652
I'm not fighting. I'm establishing parameters.
He doesn't respect me.

09:25.748 --> 09:29.012
Of course he does. You just...
You just have to talk to him.

09:29.109 --> 09:31.156
Yelling at him doesn't
get you anywhere.

09:31.253 --> 09:33.140
How can I talk to him?
There's a door between us.

09:33.236 --> 09:37.014
- " You need to give him"
the benefit of the doubt.
- "Eighteen-hundred dollars?"

09:37.109 --> 09:40.182
And maybe there's more.
He's doing something he shouldn't be.

09:40.278 --> 09:42.295
He said he won the money at the track.

09:42.390 --> 09:45.302
- You think he could've come up
with a better lie than that.
- Maybe he was telling the truth.

09:45.398 --> 09:48.535
- Come on, Helen. Where you going?
- Wherever.

09:48.631 --> 09:51.736
- Hey, hey, hey. What's in the bag?
- Some clothes.

09:51.831 --> 09:54.105
Well, open it.

09:54.200 --> 09:56.185
- What?
- Open the bag.

10:00.570 --> 10:04.634
I'm warning you. Open that bag
or I'm gonna open it myself.

10:05.978 --> 10:08.666
- Mom.
- Kyle, listen to your father.

10:08.762 --> 10:11.868
- It's none of his business.
- As long as you're living in my house it is.

10:11.963 --> 10:15.739
Your house? This isn't your house.
You can't even pay the rent.

10:15.836 --> 10:18.397
- Oh, Kyle.
- Hey!

10:18.492 --> 10:20.924
Come on.

10:21.019 --> 10:24.252
- Come on, will you quit snooping, please?
- Don't even think about it.

10:37.823 --> 10:42.368
What is this?
Huh? Coke? Heroin?

10:44.257 --> 10:46.399
- Give it back, Dad.
- What did you say?

10:46.496 --> 10:48.672
- I need it.
- What do you mean, you "need" it?

10:48.769 --> 10:51.392
- What are you, some kind of junkie?
- No.

10:51.488 --> 10:54.082
- I'm just delivering it to this guy.
If I don't get it to him...
- Who?

10:54.178 --> 10:57.473
- It's just a guy, okay?
- Who?

10:57.569 --> 11:00.675
Give me a name.

11:01.730 --> 11:04.226
Kyle, answer your father.

11:06.980 --> 11:10.499
- Just give it to me, okay!
- Hey!

11:10.595 --> 11:13.893
- Stop it! Stop it, both of you!
- Get off! Get off me!

11:13.988 --> 11:15.812
Both of you!
Both of you stop!

11:15.908 --> 11:18.789
- "Sam! Sam! Don't you...Sam! Kyle!"
- "Come here! Come here!"

11:40.168 --> 11:43.593
I can't reiterate this enough.
This is a credible threat.

11:43.689 --> 11:47.114
Salazar's people will release this virus
if we don't find it first.

11:47.209 --> 11:49.547
So let's get going.

11:58.155 --> 12:01.164
We're gonna need a white room
with full audio and video capability.

12:01.259 --> 12:05.643
Get me 3-B if that's available.
Log him in.

12:05.740 --> 12:07.565
I thought you were
supposed to be with my dad.

12:07.660 --> 12:10.220
I was. He sent me back here.

12:10.317 --> 12:12.460
- Why?
- To question Parker.

12:12.556 --> 12:15.757
Parker? He already turned in Kyle Singer.
What else are you gonna get from him?

12:15.853 --> 12:18.126
Nothing. And that's the point.

12:18.221 --> 12:22.927
- I don't understand.
- Your dad's sidelining me, Kim.
He's making me sit out.

12:23.022 --> 12:25.519
- Why?
- Why do you think?

12:25.615 --> 12:28.176
Because of us?

12:29.712 --> 12:31.727
Chase, I'm sorry.

12:31.825 --> 12:35.440
He says he's protecting me. But I'm
not the one he's trying to protect here.

12:35.537 --> 12:37.426
You're not blaming me, are you?

12:38.865 --> 12:41.169
Look, all I'm saying is
we shouldn't have told him.

12:41.265 --> 12:44.658
What were we supposed to do? Keep sneaking
around until someone catches us?

12:44.754 --> 12:47.410
- Or we could have waited.
- Until when?

12:47.506 --> 12:49.490
He'd have the same response
no matter when we told him.

12:51.443 --> 12:53.523
I gotta deal
with this kid Parker.

13:08.886 --> 13:13.142
Jeffrey, the food's
exceptionally bad today.

13:14.807 --> 13:19.190
Aren't there laws in this country
for cruel and unusual punishment?

13:23.192 --> 13:25.624
Tell Annicon I'm ready to talk.

13:35.385 --> 13:38.395
Bauer couldn't tell me,
but Salazar's got some kind of leverage.

13:38.490 --> 13:40.315
Enough to get him released.

13:40.411 --> 13:43.386
I'm not about to let this son of a bitch
erase the last two years of my life.

13:43.482 --> 13:47.259
Call your friend at the State Department...
see what he can tell you.

13:47.387 --> 13:51.164
Annicon.

13:51.293 --> 13:53.596
- Mr. Annicon?
- Yeah.

13:53.692 --> 13:56.893
- This is Jeff Benson, Salazar's guard.
- I know who you are.

13:56.989 --> 14:00.093
- Sir, Salazar asked to see you.
- Why?

14:00.190 --> 14:02.077
He says he's ready to talk.

14:04.926 --> 14:07.135
I'll be right there.

14:20.032 --> 14:22.848
Don't ask me why. Just do it.

14:22.945 --> 14:25.152
- I hope you can get a refund.
- A refund?

14:25.249 --> 14:27.138
From whoever sold you
that load of crap.

14:27.233 --> 14:30.817
David, Keeler is gonna use this
against you in this debate.

14:30.914 --> 14:32.961
Now ignoring it is not
gonna make it go away.

14:33.059 --> 14:35.107
Neither will dignifying it
with a response.

14:35.203 --> 14:37.187
He's gonna claim that
Anne perjured herself...

14:37.283 --> 14:41.636
- which, in case you've forgotten, is a felony.
- Anne is no felon.

14:42.820 --> 14:44.867
The allegation itself
is enough to damage you.

14:44.964 --> 14:46.788
Now come on, David, please, think.

14:46.885 --> 14:50.340
You know you can't go into this debate
without some kind of response.

14:52.646 --> 14:57.125
- What do you propose?
- Talk to Anne,
make sure she's told you everything.

14:57.221 --> 14:59.110
She has told me everything.

14:59.238 --> 15:00.902
Are you sure?

15:02.854 --> 15:06.888
Ever since I started seeing Anne, you've taken
every chance to undermine our relationship.

15:06.983 --> 15:09.609
- Just because you don't like...
- You're absolutely right. I don't like her.

15:09.704 --> 15:13.512
But this isn't about me and Anne.
It's about you and Anne.

15:13.641 --> 15:17.673
Now, if she's got nothing to hide, fine,
David, she's got nothing to hide.

15:17.770 --> 15:21.962
But you'd better find out before you
face off with Keeler on national television.

15:22.057 --> 15:26.762
Check one. That's good. Right.

15:26.857 --> 15:31.532
All right, presidential mike check,
presidential mike check. Check.

15:44.525 --> 15:47.278
Did you ask your friend
Jack Bauer what's going on?

15:50.574 --> 15:54.351
You did, didn't you?
But he wouldn't say.

15:55.791 --> 15:58.896
It must be very frustrating,
Luis, being kept in the dark.

15:58.991 --> 16:01.936
You have something to tell me?

16:02.031 --> 16:04.208
I asked you here, didn't I?

16:04.305 --> 16:07.408
Then start talking, because
you used up my patience an hour ago.

16:07.504 --> 16:11.121
Whoa. You are a dog
with a bone, Luis.

16:11.217 --> 16:13.713
Once you bite down,
you don't let go.

16:13.810 --> 16:16.915
When I'm out of here,
I don't want you on me anymore.

16:17.010 --> 16:18.898
When you're out of here?

16:18.995 --> 16:23.476
- You were right. In a few hours, I'm going home.
- Really?

16:23.571 --> 16:28.179
- And how will you manage that?
- Hector's a good brother.

16:28.276 --> 16:31.604
Unless he's got a key to this place,
you're not going anywhere.

16:31.732 --> 16:33.556
But he does have a key.

16:33.653 --> 16:36.565
And when he turns it,
the last two years of your life...

16:36.661 --> 16:39.221
all the hours you spent
away from your family...

16:39.318 --> 16:42.486
all the work you've done
to put me here, will go away.

16:42.582 --> 16:44.854
Just like that.

16:48.151 --> 16:50.743
I wanted you to
hear it from me, Luis.

16:50.838 --> 16:54.776
I wanted it to be
the last thing you ever heard.

17:27.516 --> 17:29.982
Your son will be
returned to you now.

17:35.870 --> 17:38.302
I'm just saying that
Kyle is in over his head.

17:38.398 --> 17:42.911
- We're not calling a lawyer.
He hasn't even been arrested.
- Not yet.

17:43.007 --> 17:44.831
Maybe he won't be.

17:44.927 --> 17:47.743
If we leave it alone,
don't do anything...

17:47.840 --> 17:50.753
maybe this whole thing
will just go away.

17:50.848 --> 17:54.945
- You can't be serious.
- Why not, Sam? Why do we
have to let anybody know?

17:55.040 --> 17:56.706
Because it's against the law not to.

17:56.801 --> 18:00.098
What are you suggesting we do,
call the police?

18:00.226 --> 18:03.714
Maybe they'll give us a reward
and then we can pay our rent?

18:05.026 --> 18:07.427
All right, that wasn't fair.
I'm sorry.

18:18.404 --> 18:20.709
- Oh, my God!
- Hey, what are you doing?

18:20.805 --> 18:22.853
I'm gonna get rid of it!
You want to visit your son in jail?

18:22.949 --> 18:25.542
Wait a minute! Helen!

18:27.206 --> 18:30.438
Get back! Get back! Hands up! Hands up!

18:30.535 --> 18:33.094
- "Move, move, move!"
- Kyle Singer!

18:33.191 --> 18:35.494
- "He's not here!"
- Isolate him and draw blood for a full panel...

18:35.590 --> 18:38.344
get an oral swab,
seal off all these windows and vents.

18:40.520 --> 18:43.081
No!

18:44.072 --> 18:46.056
In here! In here!

18:46.152 --> 18:48.488
- No!
- Put her in quarantine.

18:50.666 --> 18:52.873
Tony, the virus is out!

18:52.969 --> 18:54.794
I repeat, the virus is out!

18:54.891 --> 18:57.097
- Copy that, Jack. Where is it?
- "In the sewage system."

18:57.195 --> 18:59.979
Get D.W.P. To shut down
all lines from ground zero.

19:00.074 --> 19:03.659
It might also be airborne. Get the Fire
Department and L.A.P.D. To set up a perimeter.

19:03.755 --> 19:06.123
- Tell them we've got a level three hot zone.
- "Copy that."

19:21.453 --> 19:24.270
Come in.

19:26.318 --> 19:28.207
Wayne said you wanted to see me.

19:29.935 --> 19:32.816
- What's wrong?
- Keeler.

19:34.351 --> 19:36.399
He's bringing your ex-husband
into this debate.

19:36.496 --> 19:39.664
The S.E.C.'s investigation
into his company.

19:39.761 --> 19:41.584
Well, Ted was convicted
and served his sentence.

19:41.681 --> 19:44.274
- You know that.
- I know what you told me.

19:44.369 --> 19:49.875
I told you everything there is to know. Ted's
company was introducing a hypertension drug.

19:49.970 --> 19:51.794
- And you reviewed the research.
- Yes.

19:51.891 --> 19:54.355
Which later turned out
to have been fabricated.

19:54.451 --> 19:56.275
Which Ted knew at the time
and I didn't.

19:56.372 --> 19:59.795
Now Ted's claiming
that you both knew.

20:07.700 --> 20:10.517
He can't reverse himself eight years
after giving sworn testimony.

20:10.613 --> 20:13.815
Well, he is. And he's willing to go
on record with the press.

20:13.910 --> 20:15.798
I don't know what to say
except he's a liar.

20:15.927 --> 20:17.750
It's your word against his.

20:17.846 --> 20:19.734
David...

20:21.143 --> 20:24.599
you have reason to be suspicious.

20:24.695 --> 20:28.791
God knows you've been betrayed by
some of the people you've trusted most.

20:28.888 --> 20:31.192
But I'm not Sherry.

20:31.288 --> 20:33.176
I told you the whole truth once.

20:36.025 --> 20:39.003
I'm not gonna defend it.

20:39.098 --> 20:43.418
Because if there's anything less
than complete trust between us...

20:45.563 --> 20:47.450
I do trust you, Anne.

20:49.915 --> 20:51.803
You should.

20:53.467 --> 20:56.220
Excuse me.

21:00.861 --> 21:02.845
- Yes?
- We need to talk, David.

21:02.942 --> 21:06.142
- I'm with Anne now.
- Ah, let me guess, she denied everything.

21:06.238 --> 21:09.055
- I believe her.
- Yeah, well...

21:09.150 --> 21:12.415
- Listen, I might be able to
make this whole thing go away.
- How?

21:12.510 --> 21:15.007
Meet me in the auditorium. Alone.

21:16.064 --> 21:18.143
All right.

21:21.953 --> 21:24.640
So have you had a chance to take
a look at Nicole's field report yet?

21:24.736 --> 21:27.105
- Yeah, I'm almost done.
- What are your impressions?

21:27.234 --> 21:29.281
Based on what I've read
so far, I'm optimistic.

21:29.378 --> 21:31.553
So you think we'll be able
to contain the virus?

21:31.648 --> 21:33.665
At the very least we should be
able to limit the casualties.

21:33.763 --> 21:35.586
Even though the virus is airborne?

21:35.682 --> 21:37.827
There is some risk of it spreading,
but Nicole's team acted fast.

21:37.922 --> 21:41.699
They evacuated and sealed off the apartment
building and quarantined the Singers.

21:41.795 --> 21:44.292
- When do we get their test results?
- Five minutes, 10 tops.

21:45.213 --> 21:46.948
So it looks like we lucked out, huh?

21:47.043 --> 21:49.221
- Yeah, we deserve a little luck.
- All right, look, uh...

21:49.316 --> 21:51.781
- I gotta go. Keep me in the loop, all right?
- Okay, you do the same.

21:51.877 --> 21:53.701
Okay.

21:53.796 --> 21:55.621
Tony, L.A.P.D.'s
setting up the perimeter...

21:55.717 --> 21:57.542
but they need wind vectors
for the last 15 minutes.

21:57.637 --> 22:00.487
Call Meteorology,
extension 2112.

22:00.614 --> 22:04.295
Tony, local news picked up the story about the
dead body being dumped at Health Services.

22:04.390 --> 22:07.366
- Great.
- They want a statement.
What do you want me to tell them?

22:07.463 --> 22:09.576
Nothing.

22:09.672 --> 22:11.687
Tony. Warden Mitchell's on the phone.

22:11.783 --> 22:14.088
He's calling from the prison.
He says it's urgent.

22:18.057 --> 22:19.944
Almeida.

22:30.730 --> 22:33.579
- Mr. And Mrs. Singer?
- What the hell is going on here?

22:33.674 --> 22:35.787
Because this is not about drugs.

22:35.884 --> 22:38.475
- We think you've been exposed to a virus.
- A virus?

22:38.571 --> 22:40.397
It's called the Cordilla virus.

22:40.492 --> 22:42.988
We believe that your son carried it in from
Mexico this morning without knowing.

22:43.084 --> 22:44.812
What do you mean
"carried it in"? How?

22:44.908 --> 22:48.589
- He thought he was carrying drugs.
- So we've been exposed?

22:48.684 --> 22:52.879
- I'm afraid so.
- What does that mean? Are we sick?

22:52.974 --> 22:55.534
We're gonna have to keep you quarantined
until we get the results back from your tests.

22:55.629 --> 22:57.838
Excuse me for one moment.

22:57.933 --> 23:00.335
- Yeah, this is Bauer.
- Jack, it's Tony.

23:00.463 --> 23:02.351
Tony, I think Kyle Singer's been exposed.

23:02.446 --> 23:05.072
- Yeah, we've already got an all-points out on him.
- Have you set a perimeter?

23:05.168 --> 23:06.992
We're doing everything
we can to contain this thing.

23:07.088 --> 23:09.456
All agencies and departments are
in the loop on a need-to-know basis.

23:09.553 --> 23:11.665
- Okay. Good work.
- Listen, Jack, uh...

23:11.760 --> 23:13.873
I know this isn't the best time
to tell you, but...

23:13.969 --> 23:16.914
- I just got some bad news
I figured you wanna know about.
- What's wrong?

23:17.010 --> 23:19.569
- Luis Annicon was murdered.
- Murdered? How?

23:19.666 --> 23:21.810
Salazar's guard.
We've got him in custody.

23:21.905 --> 23:25.363
He claims that Salazar had his son kidnapped
and threatened to kill him if he didn't do it.

23:25.459 --> 23:28.498
Jack, I'm sorry. I know you two
worked closely on this case.

23:28.596 --> 23:30.772
- Tony, I'm gonna have to get back to you.
- Is everything okay?

23:30.867 --> 23:32.916
- I'm gonna get back to you.
- Jack?

23:50.326 --> 23:53.111
- These results can't be right.
- They are.

23:53.207 --> 23:57.560
- Check it again.
- I have. Blood and saliva,
atmospheric and surface tests.

23:57.655 --> 24:01.752
They're all negative. We can't find
even a trace amount of this virus.

24:14.266 --> 24:17.113
- What the hell are you doing?
You haven't showered down yet.
- We're not at risk.

24:17.212 --> 24:19.291
What are you talking about?
I watched the powder get out.

24:19.387 --> 24:22.427
- It's harmless, Jack. Some form
of silicate, but that's all.
- What?

24:22.523 --> 24:25.372
There is no virus in the powder.
We tested five samples.

24:25.468 --> 24:27.707
There weren't even trace amounts.

24:27.805 --> 24:30.877
Atmospheric and surface analysis
also came up negative.

24:30.972 --> 24:34.045
- "And Kyle's parents tested negative as well."
- You're sure about this?

24:34.140 --> 24:36.286
The only thing I'm not sure about
is if we're on the right trail.

24:36.382 --> 24:39.934
No. No, the body that was dropped off at
Health Services was linked to Kyle Singer.

24:40.030 --> 24:43.487
Why would Salazar's people pay him to
bring across a bag of worthless powder?

24:43.583 --> 24:46.686
Fine, Jack, but where do
we even start looking?

24:46.783 --> 24:48.736
I don't know.

24:53.408 --> 24:55.553
Wait a second.

24:55.648 --> 24:58.240
Macer said the only way to transport
the virus was in crystalline form, right?

24:58.337 --> 25:00.897
Yeah, that's the only way it can
survive outside a living body.

25:00.993 --> 25:04.097
- What if it was never outside a living body?
- What do you mean?

25:04.193 --> 25:06.082
What if the virus was transported
inside a living host?

25:06.178 --> 25:09.283
What if Kyle Singer was infected earlier
this morning in Mexico before he even left?

25:09.378 --> 25:11.972
But Salazar has no leverage if Singer's
walking around infecting people.

25:12.067 --> 25:14.115
That's the point.
He wouldn't be contagious yet.

25:15.171 --> 25:16.995
The incubation period is 14 hours.

25:17.091 --> 25:20.901
Right. Think about it. We know for a fact
that Kyle Singer was in Mexico 11 hours ago.

25:21.028 --> 25:24.262
Hector Salazar hasn't threatened to
release the virus for another three hours.

25:24.357 --> 25:27.558
- The math adds up.
- We need to find Kyle Singer.

25:27.653 --> 25:29.862
- Hello?
- Linda.

25:29.957 --> 25:31.942
Kyle, I told you.
I have nothing to say to you.

25:32.038 --> 25:33.863
No, no, listen to me, okay?

25:33.958 --> 25:36.295
- I'm in trouble.
- Yeah, because you're dealing drugs.

25:36.391 --> 25:39.207
- I need your help.
- What happened?

25:39.303 --> 25:41.127
My dad found the stuff.

25:41.223 --> 25:45.192
We got in a fight, I split.
But he's still got it.

25:45.288 --> 25:47.175
And I gotta get this to them, all right?

25:47.273 --> 25:50.696
- These guys are hard core.
I-I gotta make it right.
- Make it right how?

25:50.793 --> 25:54.217
I don't know. I was thinking, you know,
maybe I could pay them enough, you know.

25:54.313 --> 25:56.938
- Just to keep them off my back.
- You want me to give you money?

25:57.034 --> 25:59.753
- No, no, no, just borrow.
- How much?

25:59.850 --> 26:01.899
It's about 20 grand on the street.

26:01.995 --> 26:04.522
I don't have that kind of money, Kyle.

26:04.618 --> 26:07.660
- Didn't you say your dad keeps
some cash around the house?
- Not that much.

26:07.756 --> 26:10.827
Linda, listen to me.

26:10.924 --> 26:15.052
These guys, they will kill me
if I don't give them something.

26:16.204 --> 26:18.412
Please. Please, anything
will help right now.

26:18.509 --> 26:20.813
Now you want me
to get involved in this?

26:20.909 --> 26:25.903
Just... Just let me borrow something, anything.
I will pay you back. I swear to God.

26:27.726 --> 26:29.742
- Where are you?
- I'm at the mall.

26:31.343 --> 26:33.967
- I'll get there as soon as I can.
- Thank you.

26:35.695 --> 26:38.320
C.T.U. Knows the powder's not real.
Now they're going after Singer.

26:38.416 --> 26:41.744
- What do you want me to do?
- Stay with him,
and as soon as he's alone, grab him...

26:41.872 --> 26:43.568
- and take him to containment.
- Done.

26:43.666 --> 26:47.793
You can't let the cops get him.
We need Singer to make this work.

26:59.891 --> 27:01.716
- Don't lose the boy.
- Of course.

27:01.812 --> 27:04.596
After you follow him, do what you have to
do to him. I don't want nothing to happen.

27:04.691 --> 27:07.507
Of course there's no way
we'll ever release Salazar.

27:07.605 --> 27:09.653
What are the alternatives?

27:09.749 --> 27:13.013
C.T.U. Is very close
to containing the threat.

27:13.109 --> 27:15.862
Yes, that's right.

27:15.957 --> 27:18.838
All right, Stan.
I'll make sure you're kept in the loop.

27:18.966 --> 27:21.718
- What is it, Wayne?
- I just spoke to Anne's ex-husband.

27:21.815 --> 27:24.950
Now, listen, all Ted Packard
wants is money.

27:25.047 --> 27:28.696
- If we pay him off,
he'll recant before this debate.
- That's blackmail.

27:28.791 --> 27:30.935
- That's business.
- I don't think so.

27:31.031 --> 27:34.841
David, it's a helluva lot cheaper than
trying to defend against this allegation...

27:34.969 --> 27:38.266
- which is going to hurt you.
- I've faced down worse lies.

27:38.361 --> 27:41.786
I think I've earned some credibility.

27:41.881 --> 27:44.730
You read the polls this morning?

27:44.826 --> 27:50.459
Because Keeler is closing the gap, and this
race is much closer than it should be.

27:50.555 --> 27:52.827
Now, listen,
I know it's distasteful, David...

27:52.923 --> 27:56.155
but in cost-benefit terms,
it's a no-brainer.

27:56.253 --> 27:58.716
- Anne won't think so.
- Anne doesn't have to know.

27:58.812 --> 28:01.819
I can't keep it from her.

28:01.916 --> 28:03.900
Well, that's your choice.

28:03.998 --> 28:05.821
But if this comes out...

28:05.917 --> 28:09.565
Anne is gonna find herself on the front page
of every single newspaper in this country.

28:09.663 --> 28:12.990
And, David, she's not Sherry. She's not
equipped to handle that kind of scrutiny.

28:13.118 --> 28:15.710
And you will not be able
to protect her from it.

28:21.024 --> 28:22.848
Now between this debate...

28:22.943 --> 28:25.664
and the threat of this outbreak, you have
enough on your plate to worry about.

28:25.759 --> 28:29.281
Don't be a martyr.
Keep it simple.

28:32.449 --> 28:34.625
We can have the money within the hour.

28:52.069 --> 28:53.957
Do it.

29:01.285 --> 29:05.734
What's going on? They don't have their suits
on. What does that mean? Are we okay?

29:05.830 --> 29:07.750
- Yes, the powder was harmless.
- Oh, thank God.

29:07.878 --> 29:10.758
Then you put us through all this for nothing?
You scared the hell out of us.

29:10.886 --> 29:12.615
Mr. Singer, we still need to find your son.

29:12.711 --> 29:14.534
Is there anything that you
can tell us that would help?

29:14.632 --> 29:16.392
Why? You just said
the powder was harmless.

29:16.487 --> 29:19.048
We believe your son was infected with
the virus in Mexico earlier this morning...

29:19.144 --> 29:21.192
before he came home.

29:21.287 --> 29:24.425
We have three hours to find him
before he becomes contagious.

29:24.521 --> 29:27.531
What are you saying?
That our son could die?

29:27.626 --> 29:31.242
- Yes, that could happen.
- Oh, God.

29:31.338 --> 29:34.571
Look, I know how difficult
this must be for you. And I'm sorry.

29:34.667 --> 29:36.939
But we need to find your son.
We need to find him now.

29:37.995 --> 29:39.884
Uh, have you tried his cell phone?

29:40.012 --> 29:42.092
Yes. The line's been disconnected.

29:42.188 --> 29:45.164
Oh, wait. Oh, wait, wait, wait. Wait.

29:48.173 --> 29:50.541
- He took my phone this morning.
- What's the number?

29:50.636 --> 29:53.741
818-555-0103.

29:53.838 --> 29:56.078
Okay, I'm gonna need
one of you to call him.

29:58.318 --> 30:00.815
This is my fault.

30:00.910 --> 30:03.663
Kyle never would have done any of this
if I could take care of my own family.

30:03.759 --> 30:06.096
- No.
- Yes, you know it's true.

30:06.192 --> 30:08.047
- Tony, it's Jack.
- Yeah, Jack, I just spoke to L.A.P.D.

30:08.143 --> 30:10.031
They got a priority A.P.B. Out on Singer.

30:10.160 --> 30:11.984
Okay, good. I think
we've got a number on him.

30:12.080 --> 30:14.800
All right, look, uh, we'll thread the line
through a tracing matrix.

30:14.896 --> 30:19.634
Okay, the number
is 818-555-0103.

30:19.761 --> 30:21.649
- Route the call back through my cell phone.
- Got it.

30:21.777 --> 30:24.626
I need you to trace that number and
reroute the call through Jack's cell phone.

30:27.058 --> 30:29.459
I'm gonna need one of you
to make the call now.

30:29.587 --> 30:33.075
I need you to keep him on the line
as long as possible, so we can trace him.

30:33.171 --> 30:37.364
Um, what am I supposed to tell him?

30:39.188 --> 30:42.453
The truth.
Tony, you set?

30:42.548 --> 30:44.341
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we're ready.

30:52.311 --> 30:55.191
- Linda?
- Kyle, it's your father.

30:56.503 --> 30:58.391
Dad?

30:59.416 --> 31:01.240
We need to talk.

31:01.336 --> 31:03.159
Look, I don't know what
you wanna talk about.

31:03.255 --> 31:07.192
- I know how pissed off you are, okay?
- Look, um, whatever you did...

31:07.288 --> 31:10.424
I know you were just trying
to help out your mom and me.

31:10.520 --> 31:13.273
Yeah, well, look, unless you're
willing to give back the stuff you took...

31:13.370 --> 31:17.563
- I gotta deal with the situation, okay?
- Kyle! Please, don't hang up!

31:17.658 --> 31:21.082
Please, just listen to me.

31:21.179 --> 31:24.667
What I'm telling you is important.
Please, you have to come home.

31:24.764 --> 31:26.587
Dad, why do you sound different?

31:26.683 --> 31:30.044
I need you to trust me
on something I'm about to tell you.

31:31.709 --> 31:33.596
Dad?

31:33.693 --> 31:35.518
You may have gotten a virus...

31:35.613 --> 31:39.325
something you picked up in Mexico.

31:39.421 --> 31:41.309
What? How-How did you know
I went to Mexico?

31:41.407 --> 31:44.926
It doesn't matter.
But you may be sick.

31:45.021 --> 31:48.480
And-And if you are, then you need
to get checked out by a doctor.

31:48.575 --> 31:51.647
Look, Dad, I don't know what you're
talking about, all right? But l-I feel fine.

31:51.743 --> 31:53.632
I know it sounds crazy.

31:53.760 --> 31:57.919
But it's real. Now there's some people
here who are trying to help.

31:58.016 --> 31:59.841
- Cops?
- Tony, have you got a lock on this trace?

31:59.936 --> 32:01.761
- We're gonna lose this kid.
- How much longer?

32:01.857 --> 32:04.641
I've got a cell tower,
but it's covering a three-mile radius.

32:04.736 --> 32:06.562
I can't believe this.

32:06.658 --> 32:08.866
This is like you. One minute
you tell me you love me...

32:08.961 --> 32:10.850
The next minute,
you sell me out to some cops.

32:10.945 --> 32:12.771
They're not the police, Kyle.

32:12.867 --> 32:16.515
They're-they're just trying to stop this virus
before it-it becomes an outbreak.

32:16.610 --> 32:18.627
Dad, I already told ya.
I feel fine, all right?

32:18.724 --> 32:21.827
Look, they're saying that you're not gonna
start feeling sick for another few hours.

32:21.923 --> 32:24.421
- But by then, it's gonna be too late.
- Tony, have you got a lock yet?

32:24.516 --> 32:26.308
- How much longer?
- Ten seconds.

32:26.404 --> 32:28.708
What do you want me to do?
You want me to turn myself in?

32:28.804 --> 32:30.630
You may be sick.

32:30.725 --> 32:33.701
And if you are,
other people are gonna get infected.

32:33.798 --> 32:35.621
- Tony!
- We got it, Jack.

32:35.717 --> 32:37.766
He's at Los Feliz Mall,
between Vermont and Sunset.

32:37.863 --> 32:40.710
Okay, get his photograph over to mall
security. Tell them not to approach him.

32:40.807 --> 32:43.015
Look, Jack, you're 20 minutes away by car.

32:43.112 --> 32:44.935
I can land a team there in 10 minutes.

32:45.031 --> 32:48.360
- Fine. Tony, I don't want you taking Chase.
- Why not?

32:48.488 --> 32:51.273
I just don't.

32:51.368 --> 32:54.922
Thank you very much. We'll notify you
as soon as we have him in custody.

32:55.017 --> 32:57.833
- Please. Help our son.
- We will.

33:00.201 --> 33:02.921
O'Brian.

33:03.019 --> 33:06.314
Chloe, I'm not sure if you've heard
yet, but Tony's heading off-site for awhile.

33:06.410 --> 33:08.299
- "He is?"
- "Yeah. I'm taking over for a few hours."

33:08.395 --> 33:10.443
- "Okay."
- "Let people in your area know."

33:10.539 --> 33:12.522
- Okay, I will.
- Thanks.

33:12.619 --> 33:16.812
- What was that?
- Michelle. She's taking over C.T.U.
For a couple of hours.

33:16.908 --> 33:20.205
- Where's Tony?
- We have a location on Singer.

33:20.301 --> 33:24.237
- Jack can't get there in time, so Tony's going.
- What? Tony's not Field Ops.

33:24.332 --> 33:27.374
Seems like they're really going out
of their way to cut you outta the loop.

33:27.470 --> 33:29.486
Did you do something to piss off Jack?

33:31.439 --> 33:34.158
Bad idea, Chase.
You're just gonna make things worse.

33:41.359 --> 33:44.176
Tony! I just heard they found
Kyle Singer. Is this for real?

33:44.273 --> 33:46.097
We'll see. I'm meeting Jack
over there right now.

33:46.192 --> 33:48.017
Okay, look, I'm done
with this kid Parker, okay?

33:48.113 --> 33:50.578
He's said all he's gonna say.
I want back on the case.

33:50.673 --> 33:52.914
Yeah, well, uh, we're handling it now,
Chase, all right?

33:53.009 --> 33:56.210
'Cause Jack doesn't want me there, right?
Did he tell you why he's cutting me out?

33:56.306 --> 33:58.195
I don't care.
He's your boss. It's his call.

34:01.138 --> 34:04.915
This isn't right. Did he tell
you this is because of Kim?

34:05.012 --> 34:08.755
He found out we were seeing each other,
and this is how he's gonna make me pay for it.

34:08.853 --> 34:10.741
Take it up with Jack.

35:08.637 --> 35:12.253
Just want to keep the line open for Tony.

35:14.462 --> 35:17.950
- Leave a message for Jack Bauer.
- Damn it, Jack!

35:24.991 --> 35:26.879
Chase.

35:26.977 --> 35:28.864
Chase!

35:30.464 --> 35:32.706
Look, I know my Dad can be hard,
but he will come around.

35:32.801 --> 35:35.265
- How do you know, hmm?
- Because I know my father.

35:35.361 --> 35:37.472
Maybe you don't know him
as well as you think.

35:37.570 --> 35:39.810
What is that supposed to mean?

35:39.905 --> 35:43.651
Nothing. It's okay. Forget it.

35:45.187 --> 35:48.418
Don't you think I feel
bad enough already? Because I do.

35:51.364 --> 35:54.436
- We shouldn't have told him.
- Well, the only other option I can think of...

35:54.532 --> 35:58.853
is for us to stop seeing each other, which
as far as I'm concerned is not an option.

36:00.484 --> 36:03.942
Or is it?

36:05.254 --> 36:07.781
- Chase, what do you want?
- I wanna be able to do my job.

36:07.878 --> 36:10.791
Kim, we need you at your station.
Tony's about to land.

36:36.138 --> 36:37.962
Tony Almeida, C.T.U.

36:38.059 --> 36:40.971
I think we found the guy you're looking for.
He's in the rotunda.

36:41.099 --> 36:43.178
- Bronson, lock down the east exit.
- Yes, sir.

36:43.276 --> 36:46.764
- Pierson, I want you to run point
from the security office.
- All right.

37:08.368 --> 37:11.217
- How long have you been using, Jack?
- What?

37:11.344 --> 37:14.608
I did a rotation in rehab. You learn
to pick out when someone's using.

37:14.703 --> 37:16.401
I don't know what
you're talking about.

37:16.497 --> 37:18.833
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

37:25.938 --> 37:28.466
How long?

37:28.563 --> 37:30.707
For a while now.

37:34.419 --> 37:37.107
It was the only way I could maintain
my cover with the Salazars.

37:37.204 --> 37:39.923
- Are you high now?
- No!

37:42.965 --> 37:45.365
- It's empty, Jack.
- Nicole, I told you. I'm fine.

37:45.492 --> 37:47.862
- I'm not so sure.
- If you're not so sure, then turn me in.

37:47.989 --> 37:51.637
I don't wanna turn you in, Jack.
I'm worried about you.

37:54.647 --> 37:57.366
You don't have to be.
I've kicked it.

37:59.062 --> 38:01.847
I have a responsibility
to stop this virus.

38:01.943 --> 38:03.767
And I am taking
a calculated risk...

38:03.863 --> 38:07.224
that you are more of
an asset than a liability.

38:08.311 --> 38:10.743
Just please don't screw this up.

38:13.625 --> 38:18.138
I won't.

38:19.546 --> 38:22.042
Yeah?

38:22.137 --> 38:24.891
Hey, Jack, security found Singer.
I'm about to pick him up.

38:24.986 --> 38:28.634
- Okay, where are you?
- Second floor rotunda.
Top of the north escalator.

38:28.731 --> 38:31.292
- Where are you?
- We're coming in on
the loading dock, north entrance.

38:31.387 --> 38:33.467
- Have you got a visual?
- Yeah, I got him.

38:33.564 --> 38:36.157
- Where have you placed your men?
- They're posted at all the main entrances.

38:36.252 --> 38:38.812
- Okay, good. We should be there
in about a minute.
- All right.

38:46.398 --> 38:49.919
Have your men cover all
the parking level exits. Let's go!

38:59.296 --> 39:00.896
I don't wanna cause
any kind of commotion.

39:03.135 --> 39:05.088
- Yeah?
- C.T.U.'s here. They're about to move in on the kid.

39:05.217 --> 39:07.041
Stand down. It's too hot.

39:07.137 --> 39:10.306
- This is my only chance.
We can't let the kid get caught.
- No, no wait!

39:10.401 --> 39:12.226
- I can't wait.
- Gomez!

39:12.322 --> 39:15.395
- Wait here. I wanna make a clean grab.
- Yes, sir.

39:33.797 --> 39:36.614
- Kyle.
- Who are you?

39:36.710 --> 39:42.247
My name's Tony Almeida. I'm a federal agent,
but I'm here to help you.

39:42.343 --> 39:46.534
- What your father told you
about your being sick is true.
- I don't believe you.

39:46.631 --> 39:49.096
You come with me.
I'll prove it to you.

39:58.312 --> 40:00.745
Call 911! Go!

40:00.874 --> 40:03.722
Somebody's been shot!
Somebody's been shot!

40:24.012 --> 40:27.021
Get out of the way! Move!

40:37.007 --> 40:41.327
Nicole! He's been hit in the neck!

40:41.456 --> 40:43.409
Jimmy, give me your walkie-talkie.

40:43.536 --> 40:45.905
We have an officer down.
Kyle Singer is not in custody.

40:46.000 --> 40:50.193
I repeat, Kyle Singer is not in custody.
Maintain cover on all exits.
