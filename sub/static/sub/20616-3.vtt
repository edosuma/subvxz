WEBVTT

00:11.045 --> 00:13.579
I'm seeing blood.

00:13.581 --> 00:17.416
He doesn't have a face anymore.

00:17.418 --> 00:19.084
It kills me to think
that he's going

00:19.086 --> 00:20.853
to have to grow up
like I did.

00:20.855 --> 00:22.388
You're around
this person enough,

00:22.390 --> 00:26.225
and you literally become insane.

00:26.227 --> 00:30.029
He left a lot of bodies
in his wake.

00:30.031 --> 00:31.797
He might have killed her.

00:31.799 --> 00:35.267
All I want for my family
is to be safe.

00:35.269 --> 00:36.568
I'm extremely worried.

00:36.570 --> 00:39.905
This guy wants death.

00:39.907 --> 00:42.074
This is not a good situation.

00:42.076 --> 00:44.243
My name is Amy Allan.

00:44.245 --> 00:45.544
There's death here.

00:45.546 --> 00:47.346
Don't want to go down there.

00:47.348 --> 00:48.847
I see dead people.

00:48.849 --> 00:50.916
They hide in the walls,
and they watch.

00:50.918 --> 00:53.519
I speak to dead people.

00:53.521 --> 00:56.155
She's definitely
a serial killer.

00:56.157 --> 00:57.856
And they speak to me.

00:57.858 --> 01:00.392
She's going to torture them.

01:00.394 --> 01:03.862
But there's only one way
to know if my findings are real.

01:03.864 --> 01:05.964
They were all murdered.

01:05.966 --> 01:07.666
I rely on my partner.

01:07.668 --> 01:09.101
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:09.103 --> 01:11.003
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

01:11.005 --> 01:13.672
So, is this the only time
you've been physically attacked?

01:13.674 --> 01:17.576
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:17.578 --> 01:19.211
There's no question
in my mind

01:19.213 --> 01:21.213
that he was talking
about Satan.

01:21.215 --> 01:23.215
It's my job to reveal them.

01:23.217 --> 01:24.750
Who do you think
possessed you?

01:24.752 --> 01:26.585
But Steve and I never speak...

01:26.587 --> 01:28.587
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:28.589 --> 01:29.955
...until the very end...

01:29.957 --> 01:31.557
Well, you're not gonna
want to see this.

01:31.559 --> 01:33.926
...when we uncover
if it's safe for you to stay...

01:33.928 --> 01:35.360
Hell no!

01:35.362 --> 01:36.862
...or time to get out.

01:36.864 --> 01:39.031
Everyone is in jeopardy.

01:41.000 --> 01:47.074

01:54.181 --> 01:55.681
I'm in El Cajon, California.

01:55.683 --> 01:58.584
It's a blue-collar suburb
just outside of San Diego.

01:58.586 --> 02:00.385
I got a call from a woman
named Melissa.

02:00.387 --> 02:02.254
Now, she sounded really bad.

02:02.256 --> 02:04.723
She told me she was forced
to move back into the house

02:04.725 --> 02:06.325
that destroyed her childhood,

02:06.327 --> 02:07.926
and now she's convinced
whatever's there

02:07.928 --> 02:10.395
is going after
her 6-year-old son.

02:10.396 --> 02:11.763
She really needs our help bad,

02:11.765 --> 02:13.599
and I'm hoping
we can help her out.

02:17.271 --> 02:19.505
Before Amy arrives,

02:19.507 --> 02:22.274
I clear the house
of any leading information.

02:22.276 --> 02:25.711
Photographs, artwork,

02:25.713 --> 02:30.415
and religious statues
can influence her findings,

02:30.417 --> 02:33.218
so it's important that I cover
or remove them all.

02:33.220 --> 02:35.954
When I'm finished,
the location will be ready

02:35.956 --> 02:37.923
for tonight's walk.

02:51.005 --> 02:53.605
A man is showing me

02:53.607 --> 02:57.709
this, like,
6- to 7-foot skeleton,

02:57.711 --> 03:00.679
half-burnt mess,

03:00.681 --> 03:04.816
and he's, like, oozing,
dripping...stuff,

03:04.818 --> 03:07.553
like, blood.

03:07.555 --> 03:09.821
And he says,
"I am the great deceiver."

03:09.823 --> 03:11.757
He goes, "Living are being
driven insane

03:11.759 --> 03:15.260
by the madness
that surrounds them."

03:15.262 --> 03:18.897
And he goes, "You think this
is crazy, you ain't seen..."

03:25.372 --> 03:26.905
So, Melissa, when we spoke
on the phone,

03:26.907 --> 03:28.640
you sounded pretty upset.

03:28.642 --> 03:29.675
Yeah.

03:29.677 --> 03:31.810
Especially about
your youngest son.

03:31.812 --> 03:32.911
What's going on?

03:32.913 --> 03:36.682
Charlie says he hears noises

03:36.684 --> 03:39.751
and sees things

03:39.753 --> 03:41.954
that kids --

03:41.956 --> 03:43.889
You can't just
fake stuff like that.

03:43.891 --> 03:45.757
How long has this been
going on with him?

03:45.759 --> 03:48.460
He's lived in this house
his whole life,

03:48.462 --> 03:50.529
and he started
talking to us about it

03:50.531 --> 03:52.030
when he was like 3 or 4.

03:52.032 --> 03:54.199
All right.
So who else lives in the house?

03:54.201 --> 03:57.135
My grandfather. He's 85.

03:57.137 --> 03:58.670
- Okay.
- Myself.

03:58.672 --> 04:01.773
My husband, Corey.
Charlie, he is 6,

04:01.775 --> 04:04.376
and Nathan, who is 16.

04:04.378 --> 04:06.745
- I understand you grew up here.
- Yeah, I did.

04:06.747 --> 04:08.280
And it was pretty bad
for you as a kid.

04:08.282 --> 04:11.250
Yeah.
I always had experiences,

04:11.252 --> 04:13.852
and they never stopped
until I left.

04:13.854 --> 04:15.721
It kills me to think
that he's going

04:15.723 --> 04:17.255
to have to grow up
like I did.

04:17.257 --> 04:18.656
I don't want that.

04:18.659 --> 04:22.127
I just don't. I want him
to have a normal childhood.

04:22.129 --> 04:23.428
Why would you come back?

04:23.430 --> 04:24.830
My grandmother passed away,

04:24.832 --> 04:29.134
and my grandfather wasn't
doing so well on his own.

04:29.136 --> 04:31.536
The only reason
why I came back.

04:31.538 --> 04:32.771
Okay.

04:32.773 --> 04:36.575
This is actually a picture
of her with a young Nathan.

04:36.577 --> 04:38.010
What did she die of?

04:38.012 --> 04:42.581
She had a routine back surgery
that went wrong.

04:42.583 --> 04:45.250
She came home,
and two days later,

04:45.252 --> 04:48.587
she went rushed back to
the hospital, and she was dead.

04:48.589 --> 04:50.255
Any other history
I should know about?

04:50.257 --> 04:54.593
I had an uncle who passed away
here as a child.

04:54.595 --> 04:56.628
- As a child?
- As a child.

04:56.630 --> 04:58.196
And this is your
grandfather's son?

04:58.198 --> 05:00.098
- Yeah.
- You think your grandfather

05:00.100 --> 05:01.833
would be willing
to talk to me?

05:01.835 --> 05:05.404
We've never really
discussed it much before.

05:05.406 --> 05:07.205
- Okay.
- You can try.

05:07.207 --> 05:09.074
So, Melissa, I know you guys
are going through hell here,

05:09.076 --> 05:12.077
but give me an idea
or a list of what's happening.

05:12.079 --> 05:14.212
Things move on their own.

05:14.214 --> 05:16.982
We have fluctuating moods,

05:16.984 --> 05:18.884
horrible nightmares,

05:18.886 --> 05:22.287
and, like, physical attacks.

05:22.289 --> 05:24.289
You mentioned mood swings.
What did you mean by that?

05:24.291 --> 05:28.427
I can just get super angry
or super sad, super depressed.

05:28.429 --> 05:29.861
It's just -- on a dime.

05:29.863 --> 05:31.963
And I've never been
a depressed person.

05:31.965 --> 05:33.365
Why don't you just
leave here, honey,

05:33.367 --> 05:34.833
and take your
grandfather with you?

05:34.835 --> 05:38.737
He doesn't want to go.
He's asked to die in this house.

05:38.739 --> 05:42.274
That's his wishes.
I want to respect his wishes.

05:42.276 --> 05:44.843
- Um...
- Okay.

05:44.845 --> 05:47.112
He helped raise me.

05:47.114 --> 05:48.680
He did so much for me,

05:48.682 --> 05:53.185
and I want him to live
the rest of his life happy.

05:57.524 --> 06:01.393
There's another man here,
and he's very sad.

06:01.395 --> 06:04.763
I think he's suffering
from severe depression.

06:04.765 --> 06:06.331
You know, all he does
is sit in a ball

06:06.333 --> 06:09.067
and...cry all the...time.

06:09.069 --> 06:12.971
So he is definitely
filling the location

06:12.973 --> 06:17.642
with this despair and heaviness.

06:17.644 --> 06:19.845
The living here
would feel depressed,

06:19.847 --> 06:22.180
thoughts of suicide and stress,

06:22.182 --> 06:24.182
so we got to get him out.

06:29.356 --> 06:31.156
Okay.
So, what's going on in here?

06:31.158 --> 06:35.527
In here, I've seen a full
apparition of my grandmother.

06:35.529 --> 06:37.929
So, where exactly did you
see your grandmother?

06:37.931 --> 06:39.664
Actually right where
I'm standing.

06:39.666 --> 06:42.200
She used to be
in the kitchen a lot.

06:42.202 --> 06:43.635
What else is going on?

06:43.637 --> 06:47.305
We hear really loud noises
going up and down the stairway.

06:47.307 --> 06:49.408
It actually sounds like
a herd of buffalo.

06:49.410 --> 06:50.776
- It's very loud.
- All right.

06:50.778 --> 06:52.878
You got two kids here.
How do you know it's not them?

06:52.880 --> 06:54.746
Charlie sleeps with us.

06:54.748 --> 06:57.115
Nathan sleeps heavy.

06:57.117 --> 06:58.517
Okay.
So what else is going on?

06:58.519 --> 07:01.586
Things get thrown,
like, violently thrown.

07:01.588 --> 07:03.355
Like what, for instance?

07:03.357 --> 07:05.157
My hairbrush
has gotten thrown

07:05.159 --> 07:07.592
completely across the room
with force.

07:07.594 --> 07:09.294
Okay.
Has anybody been hit by it?

07:09.296 --> 07:12.164
No, but it went
about this far away

07:12.166 --> 07:13.865
from the person's face.

07:13.867 --> 07:15.700
So far, you guys have been
kind of lucky.

07:15.702 --> 07:17.903
I mean, what if that caught
somebody in the eye?

07:17.905 --> 07:19.938
I figure
it's a matter of time.

07:19.940 --> 07:21.740
I mean, with all the stuff
going on, you got to feel like

07:21.742 --> 07:24.643
- you're going out of your mind.
- I feel insane.

07:26.914 --> 07:28.413
I'm seeing another guy.

07:28.415 --> 07:29.748
He's crazy.

07:29.750 --> 07:32.884
I think he's been in and out
of mental institutions.

07:32.886 --> 07:34.853
He's usually confused and lost,

07:34.855 --> 07:38.824
and he's, like, running through
the walls, throwing a fit.

07:38.826 --> 07:40.525
I think that the living
can hear him,

07:40.527 --> 07:42.461
and he's, like,
right up in their faces.

07:42.463 --> 07:44.930
He's over them.
He's staring at them.

07:44.932 --> 07:46.264
I think they would
feel that, too,

07:46.266 --> 07:49.134
like, that kind of,
like, smothering.

07:49.136 --> 07:51.069
They'd wake up and be like,
"What the..."

07:51.071 --> 07:54.973
They know
somebody's right there.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.608
He's very sick.

07:56.610 --> 07:58.143
You're around
this person enough,

07:58.145 --> 08:01.112
and you literally become insane.

08:06.186 --> 08:07.886
Okay. Master bedroom.
This is where you sleep

08:07.888 --> 08:08.920
- with your husband...
- Yeah.

08:08.922 --> 08:10.689
- ...and Charlie.
- And Charlie.

08:10.691 --> 08:12.123
Okay.
So what's going on?

08:12.125 --> 08:14.292
Having really
bad nightmares.

08:14.294 --> 08:16.428
Okay. Now, what kind
of nightmares are you having?

08:16.430 --> 08:18.763
I feel like
I can't get home,

08:18.765 --> 08:20.966
like there's
something very urgent,

08:20.968 --> 08:24.135
and someone keeps preventing me
from coming home.

08:24.137 --> 08:25.537
Anybody else having
dreams like that?

08:25.539 --> 08:26.972
Charlie does.

08:26.974 --> 08:29.774
He's woken up with bruises.
I have a picture

08:29.776 --> 08:32.844
of when we woke him up.

08:32.846 --> 08:35.046
That's not just a bruise.
I mean --

08:35.048 --> 08:36.748
What about you? Are you
getting anything like this?

08:36.750 --> 08:39.650
Yeah. I wake up with bruises,
scratches,

08:39.653 --> 08:41.385
like burning scratches.

08:41.388 --> 08:42.754
I have a picture.

08:42.756 --> 08:44.789
It actually puffs up.

08:44.791 --> 08:46.925
I mean, we are out in the middle
of the mountains here.

08:46.927 --> 08:48.493
Any chance it could be
some kind of a rodent

08:48.495 --> 08:50.228
that came in and did this to you
or anything like --

08:50.230 --> 08:52.797
- No.
- Okay. What else?

08:52.799 --> 08:55.133
I feel like someone
is watching me,

08:55.135 --> 08:57.135
but not just watching me,

08:57.137 --> 09:01.773
like, looming over
my face and bed.

09:01.775 --> 09:03.308
- Do you see something?
- No.

09:03.310 --> 09:05.343
It's just a feeling I get.

09:05.345 --> 09:06.978
Okay.
Anything else going on in here?

09:06.980 --> 09:08.547
I was laying in bed,

09:08.549 --> 09:12.484
and I felt a hand
grab my ankle,

09:12.486 --> 09:15.754
and it was a forceful grab.

09:15.756 --> 09:19.691
It was so unnerving
and so scary.

09:19.693 --> 09:21.860
I just --
I couldn't believe

09:21.862 --> 09:23.995
it was --
that was actually happening.

09:23.997 --> 09:25.297
It's a nightmare.

09:25.299 --> 09:27.198
It's like
an actual nightmare.

09:27.200 --> 09:28.466
I mean, does
your grandfather know

09:28.468 --> 09:30.135
the sacrifice you're
making for him?

09:30.137 --> 09:31.870
No.
I don't want him to know.

09:31.872 --> 09:33.238
I don't want him to worry.

09:33.240 --> 09:34.306
He's 85.

09:34.308 --> 09:36.474
He should be
enjoying his life.

09:36.476 --> 09:38.543
You know, I don't want
to see him upset.

09:38.545 --> 09:40.445
I mean, he's 85.
He lived his life.

09:40.447 --> 09:42.881
- Something's got to give here.
- Yeah, I agree.

09:42.883 --> 09:45.850
Well, hopefully we can get
some help for you that you need.

09:45.852 --> 09:47.252
Yeah.

09:47.254 --> 09:48.520
All right.

09:52.960 --> 09:55.594
I'm seeing blood.

09:55.596 --> 09:57.395
All right. So, skeleton dude,

09:57.397 --> 10:00.065
the one I saw outside
when I first got here,

10:00.067 --> 10:02.434
is with me,

10:02.436 --> 10:04.669
and he's like,
"The writing's on the wall."

10:08.208 --> 10:09.474
I'm so nervous.

10:09.476 --> 10:11.409
Why are you here?

10:11.411 --> 10:14.479
He says he was asked to be here.

10:14.481 --> 10:15.981
The...would ask that?

10:15.983 --> 10:20.585
Okay. I'm going to assume
that someone at some point here

10:20.587 --> 10:22.320
...around with...

10:22.322 --> 10:26.257
and somehow
pulled this dead guy here.

10:26.259 --> 10:29.661
He gets physical down here --
slapping,

10:29.663 --> 10:32.263
pulling, pushing,

10:32.265 --> 10:34.766
tugging them
by the ankles down the bed.

10:34.768 --> 10:38.036
He's like, "I'll show you.
I'll show you how...bad I am."

10:38.038 --> 10:40.405
He's like,
"I have killed people."

11:00.193 --> 11:01.693
So, Charlie,
let me ask you something.

11:01.695 --> 11:04.362
- How old are you?
-6.

11:04.364 --> 11:06.464
So, this looks like a fun room
to hang out in.

11:06.466 --> 11:08.500
I mean, do you like it
in here?

11:08.502 --> 11:09.634
It's scary for me.

11:09.636 --> 11:11.436
It's scary?

11:11.438 --> 11:13.705
You seen some bad things here?

11:13.707 --> 11:15.273
Can you tell me
about some of them?

11:15.275 --> 11:18.009
So, I've heard a noise
in the kitchen.

11:18.011 --> 11:19.144
What kind of sound was it?

11:19.146 --> 11:21.346
It was like a bang sound.

11:21.348 --> 11:22.514
Okay.
How many times?

11:22.516 --> 11:23.715
Three bangs.

11:23.717 --> 11:25.917
- Three bangs.
- From one right here,

11:25.919 --> 11:28.987
one in the kitchen,
and then one right next to me.

11:28.989 --> 11:30.388
What else
are you experiencing?

11:30.390 --> 11:33.958
I'm seeing stuff in my room.

11:33.960 --> 11:35.193
Okay.
What are you seeing?

11:35.195 --> 11:36.795
Black figures.

11:36.797 --> 11:38.329
How often do you see that?

11:38.331 --> 11:40.765
I only see it at night.

11:40.767 --> 11:42.967
All right.
So, what else are you seeing?

11:42.969 --> 11:46.104
I was, like,
just watching TV,

11:46.106 --> 11:49.774
and I looked over
at a bottle,

11:49.776 --> 11:52.243
and it when I was
looking at it, it moved.

11:52.245 --> 11:54.946
- Where'd this happen?
- In my room.

11:54.948 --> 11:58.083
Okay. So, Charlie, I know
this place is scary for you,

11:58.085 --> 12:00.885
but if we could fix this,
would you like to stay here?

12:00.887 --> 12:04.122
I want you to get rid of it

12:04.124 --> 12:06.191
so I can sleep
in my room again.

12:06.193 --> 12:07.792
Okay. That's what
we're here for.

12:07.794 --> 12:09.761
We're going to try
to do that. Okay?

12:15.469 --> 12:18.536
Skeleton man, he's, like,
showing me the person sleeping,

12:18.538 --> 12:21.039
and he's, like,
covering their mouth

12:21.041 --> 12:23.675
and pinching their nose.

12:23.677 --> 12:26.044
He does that until

12:26.046 --> 12:28.813
they, like, pass out,

12:28.815 --> 12:30.115
and then he, like, lets go.

12:30.117 --> 12:33.585
So a lot of walking up,
crying, being scared,

12:33.587 --> 12:37.288
seeing him,
seeing him, screaming.

12:46.333 --> 12:48.099
So, Corey, I was talking
to your wife, Melissa,

12:48.101 --> 12:50.301
and she's really
worried about Charlie.

12:50.303 --> 12:52.036
- How about you?
- I mean, what do you do

12:52.038 --> 12:54.105
when your 6-year-old son
comes to you,

12:54.107 --> 12:56.508
and he's so worried
about everything,

12:56.510 --> 12:58.343
and there's nothing
I can do?

12:58.345 --> 13:00.011
What I want most for him
is to be able

13:00.013 --> 13:02.247
to, you know, have
a normal childhood.

13:02.249 --> 13:03.882
She was telling me
about her grandfather.

13:03.884 --> 13:06.217
Is he that stubborn
where he won't leave here?

13:06.219 --> 13:07.719
There's no talking him
out of here.

13:07.721 --> 13:09.988
He'll die in this house.

13:09.990 --> 13:11.656
So, what experiences
have you had?

13:11.658 --> 13:14.359
I see shadow figures
all over the house.

13:14.361 --> 13:17.195
The one I saw was upstairs,
had white eyes,

13:17.197 --> 13:19.631
and when I noticed it,

13:19.633 --> 13:22.033
it was kind of sinking
into the floor.

13:22.035 --> 13:24.002
Now, how often are you
seeing these things?

13:24.004 --> 13:26.171
Probably at least
twice a week.

13:26.173 --> 13:28.306
All right. So you're seeing
shadow figures. What else?

13:28.308 --> 13:29.641
Everywhere we go
in the house,

13:29.643 --> 13:31.943
it's a constant feeling
of being watched.

13:31.945 --> 13:35.113
It's much heavier upstairs.

13:35.115 --> 13:37.816
Is it a peeping tom thing
or somebody stalking you?

13:37.818 --> 13:40.618
It's more, like, just a presence
right at your back

13:40.620 --> 13:43.521
just looming over you,
watching you.

13:43.523 --> 13:44.656
Anything else?

13:44.658 --> 13:47.392
I was actually attacked
in the kitchen.

13:47.394 --> 13:49.994
How?
I was standing
next to the stove.

13:49.996 --> 13:53.765
There was a Tupperware
container on top of the fridge,

13:53.767 --> 13:55.500
and it flew
across the counter

13:55.502 --> 13:57.902
and hit me in the side
of the head with force.

13:57.904 --> 14:00.605
- Were you alone?
- No. Nathan was with me.

14:00.607 --> 14:02.340
Are you sure he didn't
do it by accident?

14:02.342 --> 14:04.642
Yeah, he was actually
on the opposite side of me.

14:04.644 --> 14:06.444
Could have been a glass jar,
God forbid.

14:06.446 --> 14:10.415
Right.
It had very malicious intent.

14:10.417 --> 14:12.584
With all the activity
you guys are experiencing,

14:12.586 --> 14:15.119
it's got to be taking
a toll on you and Melissa.

14:15.121 --> 14:17.222
Over the last few years,
seeing, like,

14:17.224 --> 14:19.924
a total breakdown
in her mentally.

14:19.926 --> 14:22.260
Sometimes she'll wake me up
in the middle of the night,

14:22.262 --> 14:24.028
and she'll just be sobbing.

14:24.030 --> 14:27.031
It just breaks my heart
to see her that way.

14:27.033 --> 14:30.168
And it's just totally taking
a toll on her mental state,

14:30.170 --> 14:31.903
and it's really hard
to see her go through that.

14:31.905 --> 14:33.504
So, Corey, when I was
talking to your wife,

14:33.506 --> 14:36.040
she mentioned
that the house, she feels,

14:36.042 --> 14:38.243
is changing people's
personalities.

14:38.245 --> 14:40.144
I definitely would agree
with her on that.

14:40.146 --> 14:42.914
We go through bouts of anger,
bouts of depression,

14:42.916 --> 14:44.315
and we'll kind of
start bickering

14:44.317 --> 14:47.919
amongst each other
as a family.

14:47.921 --> 14:49.754
When the anger comes on,
does it come on real fast,

14:49.756 --> 14:52.757
- or does it build?
- You just go from zero to pissed

14:52.759 --> 14:56.261
in 0.2 seconds
out of nowhere.

14:56.263 --> 14:57.695
Okay.

15:00.066 --> 15:02.600
This skeleton guy,

15:02.602 --> 15:05.770
I think that he can
jump someone here,

15:05.772 --> 15:08.973
and I think it's a male.

15:08.975 --> 15:11.776
So when he is that way,
he is possessed.

15:11.778 --> 15:14.379
There's, like, a change,
literally a physical --

15:14.381 --> 15:16.948
There's some kind
of physical change

15:16.950 --> 15:21.619
when he's inside of this person.

15:21.621 --> 15:23.655
The skeleton guy goes in,

15:23.657 --> 15:25.857
like, literally walk
into the guy's body...

15:25.859 --> 15:27.358
- ...and take that energy

15:27.360 --> 15:29.127
and utilize that anger.

15:33.800 --> 15:38.202
He wants to get the dude
possessed to kill other people.

15:50.517 --> 15:52.617
Melissa told me
her uncle died in the house

15:52.619 --> 15:54.719
when he was just 4 years old.

15:54.721 --> 15:57.155
She also told me her grandfather
never talked about it.

15:57.157 --> 15:59.157
So I was a little surprised
this morning when he asked me

15:59.159 --> 16:01.526
to come over
to discuss what happened.

16:07.267 --> 16:09.567
Gene, I appreciate you
taking the time to talk with me.

16:09.569 --> 16:11.302
I know this is
a hard subject.

16:11.304 --> 16:13.571
But what can you tell me
about your little boy, Jerry?

16:13.573 --> 16:15.807
He loved playing with the kids
in the neighborhood,

16:15.809 --> 16:19.877
and he loved going to baseball
games with his brothers,

16:19.879 --> 16:22.714
just a normal 4-year-old boy.

16:25.585 --> 16:27.819
My God.
He was such a cute kid.

16:27.821 --> 16:29.454
Yeah, he was a cute kid.

16:29.456 --> 16:32.557
So, Gene, that day,
what exactly happened?

16:32.559 --> 16:36.828
On a hot day
back in August of '67,

16:36.830 --> 16:38.796
went off to work.

16:38.798 --> 16:41.532
Jerry and a neighborhood
friend of his

16:41.534 --> 16:43.301
were looking
for a place to play.

16:43.303 --> 16:46.537
And I had my old refrigerator
in the garage.

16:46.539 --> 16:50.108
And when the boys got in it,
I assume to cool off

16:50.110 --> 16:51.976
or hide,
playing hide and seek,

16:51.978 --> 16:57.015
the door automatically caught
when they closed the door.

16:57.017 --> 16:59.684
It was an accident.

16:59.686 --> 17:01.152
Okay.
So they ran out of oxygen.

17:01.154 --> 17:03.421
Yeah.
They suffocated.

17:03.423 --> 17:04.989
Okay.

17:04.991 --> 17:06.958
How'd you and your wife
handle this?

17:06.960 --> 17:11.829
As you can imagine,
she was pretty well torn up.

17:11.830 --> 17:14.298
- Gene, how old are you now?
- I'm 85.

17:14.300 --> 17:15.867
And this still sticks
with you today?

17:15.868 --> 17:17.702
Yeah. Yeah.

17:17.704 --> 17:21.138
That and my wife's
death, also.

17:21.141 --> 17:23.441
So, Gene, how do you feel
as far as,

17:23.443 --> 17:24.876
you know, your wife
and your son?

17:24.877 --> 17:27.444
- You think they're here?
- I don't know about the son,

17:27.446 --> 17:30.048
but my wife,
I feel she's --

17:30.050 --> 17:32.016
She's been
looking after me,

17:32.018 --> 17:33.851
keeping me on
the straight and narrow.

17:33.853 --> 17:36.521
I think she said
she was going to haunt me.

17:37.857 --> 17:40.558
- But in a good way.
- In a good way, yeah.

17:44.164 --> 17:45.897
I see a woman.

17:45.899 --> 17:48.166
She's in her late 40s,
early 50s.

17:48.168 --> 17:50.668
I see she has long brown hair.

17:50.670 --> 17:52.103
It's kind of clipped up.

17:52.105 --> 17:53.538
She's wearing big glasses.

17:53.540 --> 17:56.007
I think she's white,
and she is crying.

17:58.178 --> 17:59.811
She was here at some point

17:59.813 --> 18:02.780
and very stressed out
and hysterical.

18:02.782 --> 18:04.248
I don't know what happened.

18:04.250 --> 18:06.684
She's depressed,
thoughts of suicide

18:06.686 --> 18:09.587
and stress.

18:09.589 --> 18:11.289
She's screaming,
crying, pleading,

18:11.291 --> 18:13.891
"No, no, no, not my baby."

18:16.596 --> 18:19.997
So far, I've got a family being
tormented by paranormal activity

18:19.999 --> 18:24.068
on a property where two
young children suffocated.

18:24.070 --> 18:27.338
But I want to see
if there's anything else.

18:27.340 --> 18:29.974
Searching through old records,
I come across a serial killer

18:29.976 --> 18:32.510
named Clyde Carl Wilkerson.

18:32.512 --> 18:37.281
Turns out, he terrorized
the El Cajon area for years.

18:37.283 --> 18:39.383
So I reached out to a local
true crime writer

18:39.385 --> 18:41.486
who's on her way
over to meet me.

18:41.488 --> 18:43.521
She says to this day,
no one knows exactly

18:43.523 --> 18:45.523
how many people this guy killed.

18:50.363 --> 18:52.630
Cathy, thanks for meeting
with me. I appreciate that.

18:52.632 --> 18:53.998
So, let's start
from the beginning.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.267
What do we know
about this Wilkerson guy?

18:56.269 --> 18:59.837
Clyde Carl Wilkerson was born
in Northern California.

18:59.839 --> 19:02.607
And from day one,
he was trouble.

19:02.609 --> 19:06.344
He was almost a blueprint
for becoming a serial killer.

19:06.346 --> 19:09.881
At age 6, he committed arson,
was arrested for it.

19:09.883 --> 19:14.352
And at age 8, he was given
psychiatric treatment.

19:14.354 --> 19:16.087
I mean, that's the youngest
I've ever heard.

19:16.089 --> 19:18.156
He was in and out
of mental institutions

19:18.158 --> 19:19.724
most of his childhood.

19:22.395 --> 19:24.362
I'm seeing the crazy guy again.

19:24.364 --> 19:28.599
I'm in his body, and I'm looking
down a hospital corridor.

19:28.601 --> 19:30.768
No, it's not a hospital.

19:30.770 --> 19:32.403
It's like a psych ward.

19:32.405 --> 19:34.972
I'm seeing only a few
other patients,

19:34.974 --> 19:37.808
and I would say
this is the 1940s or '50s.

19:37.810 --> 19:42.280
He's strapped on a...
weird table.

19:42.282 --> 19:44.982
The table looks like
those tables

19:44.984 --> 19:49.487
that they do
lethal injections on.

19:49.489 --> 19:52.423
I know that he was at least

19:52.425 --> 19:55.960
in some kind of institution
on two occasions

19:55.962 --> 19:59.197
for his mental state.

20:01.634 --> 20:03.901
All right. So, Cathy, what's
the body count with this guy?

20:03.903 --> 20:05.670
Well, he was convicted
of three,

20:05.672 --> 20:08.105
but he was suspected
of many more.

20:08.107 --> 20:10.775
Okay. So we know he did three.
What about the first one?

20:10.777 --> 20:12.810
On June 6, 1965,

20:12.812 --> 20:15.246
just 3 miles
from your client's home,

20:15.248 --> 20:17.715
Cheryl Burnett got home
at 3:00 a.m. in the morning

20:17.717 --> 20:20.718
from bowling with friends.
She was 19 years old.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.720
Her toddler was sleeping
in the bedroom.

20:22.722 --> 20:25.223
And Wilkerson broke in
through a window

20:25.225 --> 20:27.558
and ended up raping her

20:27.560 --> 20:29.026
and then strangling her

20:29.028 --> 20:31.395
- with a drapery cord.
- All right.

20:31.397 --> 20:33.264
Does he get arrested
then for that murder?

20:33.266 --> 20:34.665
Not then for that murder,

20:34.667 --> 20:37.201
but he was always
in trouble with the law.

20:40.840 --> 20:42.273
Okay.
What about the second one?

20:42.275 --> 20:44.609
This one was just a mile
from your client's home.

20:44.611 --> 20:46.510
About two
or three weeks later,

20:46.512 --> 20:48.446
a couple were getting
ready for bed.

20:48.448 --> 20:50.414
Wilkerson goes into
the apartment building

20:50.416 --> 20:53.484
and starts beating on the couple
with a crescent wrench.

20:53.486 --> 20:57.054
He beat them so badly
that he killed the husband.

20:59.525 --> 21:01.025
Does he kill the wife,
as well?

21:01.027 --> 21:04.729
He raped the wife and left her
for dead, but she survived.

21:04.731 --> 21:06.097
Okay.
Was she able to identify him?

21:06.099 --> 21:08.199
She was unable to.

21:08.201 --> 21:10.167
Okay. So now we got two murders
a couple weeks apart.

21:10.169 --> 21:11.302
When's the third one happen?

21:11.304 --> 21:14.505
Third one doesn't happen
until 1975.

21:14.507 --> 21:16.574
Okay.
So it's 1975. What happened?

21:16.576 --> 21:19.477
Wilkerson ends up going
to Tulsa, Oklahoma,

21:19.479 --> 21:21.312
breaks into an apartment,

21:21.314 --> 21:24.548
and rapes and murders

21:24.550 --> 21:27.318
28-year-old college student
Geraldine Martin.

21:27.320 --> 21:29.020
All right. So we got three
homicides we know he did.

21:29.022 --> 21:30.054
How did they catch him?

21:30.056 --> 21:32.423
Three letters -- DNA.

21:32.425 --> 21:36.093
The El Cajon Police Department,
they grabbed him in 2002.

21:36.095 --> 21:37.995
I can only imagine there's got
to be a lot more.

21:37.997 --> 21:40.965
I think he left a lot
of bodies in his wake.

21:40.967 --> 21:42.900
Okay.
So is this guy still alive?

21:42.902 --> 21:45.369
No. He died in 2016

21:45.371 --> 21:47.638
at age 77 of an illness.

21:47.640 --> 21:50.474
He died in prison.

21:50.476 --> 21:51.742
So, there's this woman,

21:51.744 --> 21:53.511
and it's a beautiful day out,

21:53.513 --> 21:55.946
and it's 1978.

21:55.948 --> 21:58.683
The crazy guy,
he's watching her.

21:58.685 --> 22:01.052
And they're at the beach.

22:01.054 --> 22:04.488
And so I was like,
"Did he do something to her?"

22:04.490 --> 22:06.490
He might have killed her.

22:06.492 --> 22:08.492
He says he's very lost
and confused.

22:08.494 --> 22:10.528
He's very sick.

22:10.530 --> 22:11.962
Do you know how he died?

22:11.964 --> 22:15.800
I don't know.
Dementia, maybe a stroke.

22:15.802 --> 22:19.603
He said they
scrambled his brain.

22:19.605 --> 22:23.107
And he says, "I ruined
everything, everything."

22:23.109 --> 22:26.010
And then I know he's dead, too.

22:32.118 --> 22:34.118

22:35.621 --> 22:37.488
unexplained activity

22:54.240 --> 22:56.374
You know, another thing
caught my eye in research.

22:56.376 --> 22:58.509
The day after the attacks
on Pearl Harbor,

22:58.511 --> 23:01.245
the military took over
a bunch of land in the area,

23:01.247 --> 23:03.247
including Melissa
and Corey's property.

23:03.249 --> 23:05.182
I'm heading over to meet
with a military expert,

23:05.184 --> 23:07.585
who says there was
a deadly accident on the site

23:07.587 --> 23:09.387
I definitely want to know about.

23:14.861 --> 23:17.161
Well, Sergeant Major,
thanks for meeting with me.

23:17.163 --> 23:19.797
You mentioned on the phone
that the military

23:19.799 --> 23:21.699
basically just took over
my client's property

23:21.701 --> 23:23.267
right after
the Pearl Harbor attack.

23:23.269 --> 23:24.335
Now, was that common?

23:24.337 --> 23:26.036
It was very common
on the West Coast.

23:26.038 --> 23:27.371
The Army came in.

23:27.373 --> 23:29.373
The federal government
seized the property.

23:29.375 --> 23:31.208
All right. So I know my client's
house wasn't built yet,

23:31.210 --> 23:32.610
but who owned
the property back then?

23:32.612 --> 23:35.613
This was a farm owned by
a gentleman named Ed Fletcher.

23:35.615 --> 23:37.181
So what'd they wind up
doing with the property?

23:37.183 --> 23:40.117
The property became an army camp
known as Camp La Mesa,

23:40.119 --> 23:42.553
and by the way,
I have some pictures here

23:42.555 --> 23:45.656
of what the camp looked like
at the early part of the war

23:45.658 --> 23:47.892
and then later when
they actually built buildings.

23:47.894 --> 23:49.360
Had a pretty big setup,
didn't they?

23:49.362 --> 23:51.862
It was an infantry
regiment of 1,400 men.

23:51.864 --> 23:53.964
So, you mentioned on the phone,
there was a pretty bad accident

23:53.966 --> 23:55.166
I'm going to want
to know about.

23:55.168 --> 23:57.735
Yeah, on April 24, 1942,

23:57.737 --> 24:00.204
there was mortar training.

24:00.206 --> 24:01.806
That's what the weapon
looks like.

24:01.808 --> 24:03.240
Okay.
I'm familiar with this.

24:03.242 --> 24:06.444
And one of the rounds
exploded in the tube.

24:06.446 --> 24:09.146
Ooh. Now, how bad
was this explosion?

24:09.148 --> 24:12.950
It killed five men instantly.
One died in hospital.

24:12.952 --> 24:14.752
-16 were wounded.
- Okay.

24:14.754 --> 24:17.621
So were there any other deaths
that I should know about?

24:17.623 --> 24:20.891
Not that I'm aware of,
but here at Gillespie Field,

24:20.893 --> 24:23.327
which bordered
Ed Fletcher's property,

24:23.329 --> 24:27.331
there's been 24 people killed
in 13 separate accidents.

24:27.333 --> 24:28.699
Okay.
So that's a lot deaths.

24:28.701 --> 24:31.101
I don't want to go through all
of them, but did any stand out?

24:31.103 --> 24:32.736
Yeah, two of them
really stood out.

24:32.738 --> 24:35.105
In January of 1981,

24:35.107 --> 24:38.209
a 15-year-old
by the name of Grant Thompson

24:38.211 --> 24:40.544
talked his mother,
his stepfather,

24:40.546 --> 24:45.115
and two of their friends
into flying to Las Vegas.

24:45.117 --> 24:47.651
Never mind that he had
never flown a plane before.

24:47.653 --> 24:50.120
So these four adults got
on a plane with a 15-year-old,

24:50.122 --> 24:52.723
- and this kid never flew.
- That's correct.

24:52.725 --> 24:54.158
Okay.
What the hell happened?

24:54.160 --> 24:56.894
The plane never got
off the ground. It crashed.

24:56.896 --> 24:59.563
All were killed aboard.

24:59.565 --> 25:00.965
Okay. That was
a pretty bad accident.

25:00.967 --> 25:02.099
What about the second one?

25:02.101 --> 25:05.603
The second one was
a Navy F-14 Tomcat

25:05.605 --> 25:08.639
flying out of Naval Air
Station Miramar in San Diego.

25:08.641 --> 25:10.908
It encountered
mechanical problems,

25:10.910 --> 25:13.444
and the air crew
had to eject.

25:13.446 --> 25:16.947
Upon ejection, one of
the air crew broke his neck.

25:16.949 --> 25:19.283
All right. So do we know
how he broke his neck?

25:19.285 --> 25:20.918
The plane
was out of control.

25:20.920 --> 25:23.621
It was upside down
when they ejected,

25:23.623 --> 25:25.890
and he broke his neck
somewhere in that process.

25:25.892 --> 25:28.592
- Okay.
- Now, the plane did travel on

25:28.594 --> 25:31.095
and crashed here
on the airfield.

25:31.097 --> 25:33.297
It injured three people.

25:33.299 --> 25:36.600
It destroyed $6 to $9 million
worth of airport property.

25:36.602 --> 25:39.837
Have you ever seen this much
death on one airfield before?

25:39.839 --> 25:41.205
Not that I'm aware of.

25:41.207 --> 25:44.008
- It's, like, bad luck over here.
- It's quite bizarre.

25:47.380 --> 25:51.515
I'm seeing
the skeleton dude in here.

25:51.517 --> 25:53.117
Do you know how he died?

25:53.119 --> 25:57.187
I see blood, and I feel
like he had a bad death.

25:57.189 --> 25:59.356
He's, like,
dripping and melting.

26:02.528 --> 26:05.729
I know his neck got broken.

26:05.731 --> 26:07.898
I mean, he looks a little burnt.

26:15.675 --> 26:19.109
I saw several dead people
during my walk,

26:19.111 --> 26:21.645
but the skeleton man
tormenting a child

26:21.647 --> 26:24.048
had me the most concerned.

26:24.050 --> 26:25.716
There's this dead guy

26:25.718 --> 26:29.720
who doesn't really
have any clothes on.

26:29.722 --> 26:32.423
There were definitely
a lot of areas

26:32.425 --> 26:36.093
on his body and face
that were burned.

26:36.095 --> 26:41.599
And there was a child in a bed,

26:41.601 --> 26:45.769
and he has his hands
on the kid's face,

26:45.771 --> 26:49.506
over the mouth
and pinching the nose.

26:51.944 --> 26:56.046
Amy, is this what you saw?

26:56.048 --> 26:57.081
Yes.

27:17.236 --> 27:20.070
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

27:20.072 --> 27:22.172
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

27:22.174 --> 27:24.575
and our clients
for the first time.

27:24.577 --> 27:27.277
So, Amy, this is Melissa
and her husband, Corey.

27:27.279 --> 27:28.712
Now, Melissa grew up
in this house

27:28.714 --> 27:32.116
and had a miserable time here.

27:32.118 --> 27:34.284
But she has a huge heart.

27:34.286 --> 27:36.020
She moved her entire family
back here

27:36.022 --> 27:40.991
to take care of her 85-year-old
grandfather, Gene.

27:40.993 --> 27:43.394
This is her 16-year-old son,
Nathan,

27:43.396 --> 27:46.797
and this is Charlie, who's 6.

27:46.799 --> 27:48.465
Now, he's the reason we're here.

27:48.467 --> 27:49.767
Kid's having a rough time,

27:49.769 --> 27:51.135
and Melissa is scared

27:51.137 --> 27:54.004
his childhood's going to be
ruined just like hers was.

27:54.006 --> 27:56.340
So now that Amy knows
a little bit about you guys,

27:56.342 --> 27:58.609
I'll ask her describe
her walk for us.

28:00.846 --> 28:05.049
The first thing that I got
was a deceased female.

28:05.051 --> 28:06.817
She's white, and I got

28:06.819 --> 28:09.253
that she was in her late 40s,
early 50s.

28:09.255 --> 28:12.056
I also got
that she was living here

28:12.058 --> 28:15.192
around 1980s or early 1990s.

28:15.194 --> 28:17.161
She spent most of her time
in the kitchen

28:17.163 --> 28:20.431
and dining area,
which is where she is still.

28:20.433 --> 28:23.434
I saw her in a very bad state.

28:23.436 --> 28:25.903
She was hysterically crying.

28:25.905 --> 28:28.405
She was extremely depressed.

28:28.407 --> 28:29.606
She's very stressed out.

28:29.608 --> 28:33.343
She was screaming,
"No, no, no, not my baby."

28:33.345 --> 28:35.813
Now, Melissa lost her
grandmother about 10 years ago?

28:35.815 --> 28:38.982
Yeah. Well, you just
described her, basically.

28:38.984 --> 28:41.251
You told me you saw your
grandmother's apparition

28:41.253 --> 28:42.486
- in the kitchen.
- Yeah.

28:42.488 --> 28:44.688
And I could tell you
exactly what she was wearing.

28:44.690 --> 28:46.256
And we just looked
at each other.

28:46.258 --> 28:47.791
It scared me.

28:47.793 --> 28:50.794
So, why are you
afraid of her?

28:50.796 --> 28:52.262
She was a strict woman.

28:52.264 --> 28:54.198
She tried to teach me
how to be a lady.

28:54.200 --> 28:57.101
And, you know,
she had a lot of kids.

28:57.103 --> 29:00.137
And she lost her
youngest child here.

29:00.139 --> 29:02.906
Okay.
You should know about
Melissa's uncle, Jerry.

29:02.908 --> 29:05.142
He died in the garage
when he was 4 years old.

29:05.144 --> 29:08.145
On August 30, 1967, Jerry
was playing with another kid

29:08.147 --> 29:09.847
in the neighborhood
who was 3 years old,

29:09.849 --> 29:12.816
and they walked into a fridge
that was in the garage.

29:12.818 --> 29:15.586
The door locked on them,
and they suffocated.

29:15.588 --> 29:18.655
I got a photo of Jerry.
He was a really cute kid, too.

29:21.861 --> 29:26.396
Now, I actually have a picture
of Melissa's grandmother.

29:26.398 --> 29:29.700
Is it possible
this is who you saw?

29:29.702 --> 29:33.170
Yeah.
I'm sorry.

29:33.172 --> 29:34.972
Do you think she ever
got over Jerry passing?

29:34.974 --> 29:36.373
No.

29:36.375 --> 29:39.843
It's kind of hard to think that,
you know, she hasn't moved past.

29:39.845 --> 29:44.782
That's what's hard for me
right now to accept.

29:49.121 --> 29:50.721
Okay.
So what else?

29:50.723 --> 29:55.592
So there's two other dead people
who are very present,

29:55.594 --> 29:58.128
and I'm concerned about them.

29:58.130 --> 30:02.499
The first individual has mental
disorders, mental illness.

30:02.501 --> 30:04.568
He's definitely nuts.

30:04.570 --> 30:07.204
I do think that he would
affect the living.

30:07.206 --> 30:09.940
I thought maybe some of you
would hear him,

30:09.942 --> 30:12.242
because he does get
a little worked up,

30:12.244 --> 30:16.113
and so he'll start banging
things, throwing things.

30:16.115 --> 30:18.148
I was attacked
in the kitchen.

30:18.150 --> 30:20.751
There was a Tupperware
on top of the fridge,

30:20.753 --> 30:22.586
and it flew
across the counter

30:22.588 --> 30:25.823
and hit me with force
in the side of the head.

30:25.825 --> 30:28.025
- Wow.
- When I spoke to Charlie,

30:28.027 --> 30:31.795
he told me that he hears
a lot of things banging,

30:31.797 --> 30:33.063
scratching noises.

30:33.065 --> 30:35.732
- He doesn't sleep downstairs.

30:35.734 --> 30:37.668
- Okay.
- He hasn't for over a year.

30:37.670 --> 30:39.570
He sleeps with us.

30:39.572 --> 30:41.104
Okay.

30:41.106 --> 30:43.106
The other thing that unnerved me

30:43.108 --> 30:46.109
was that he does watch,

30:46.111 --> 30:49.313
and he stares,
and he'll get right in your face

30:49.315 --> 30:52.416
and do this.

30:52.418 --> 30:56.153
Being subjected to him
consistently

30:56.155 --> 30:59.389
can make you feel
like you're going insane.

30:59.391 --> 31:02.993
Actually, that's part of the
reason why I called you guys.

31:02.995 --> 31:04.995
Sometimes I can't go to sleep

31:04.997 --> 31:08.098
because I feel like somebody's
pacing on my side of the bed,

31:08.100 --> 31:09.833
back and forth,
back and forth,

31:09.835 --> 31:14.304
and that he leans over
and is right in my face.

31:14.306 --> 31:18.008
I've spent whole nights
just crying

31:18.010 --> 31:22.312
because it feels
so intrusive.

31:22.314 --> 31:24.481
Any idea who this guy might
have been when he was alive?

31:24.483 --> 31:29.052
What I was able to get from him
was that he had been

31:29.054 --> 31:31.588
in and out
of mental institutions,

31:31.590 --> 31:35.359
and I was getting the 1940s,
1950s with him,

31:35.361 --> 31:39.529
and he was showing me

31:39.531 --> 31:42.165
that he's on a beach.
He's looking out.

31:42.167 --> 31:45.736
There's a young,
attractive woman.

31:45.738 --> 31:47.671
It was 1978.

31:47.673 --> 31:50.841
I believe he killed her.

31:50.843 --> 31:53.277
Wow. It's interesting, 'cause
the stuff you're talking about

31:53.279 --> 31:57.180
reminds me of a serial killer
that terrorized the city.

31:57.182 --> 31:59.650
Now, the guy's name
is Clyde Carl Wilkerson.

31:59.652 --> 32:01.618
This kid was bad news
from the start.

32:01.620 --> 32:04.521
Wilkerson was arrested
for arson at the age of 6.

32:04.523 --> 32:06.523
Then he was in and out
of mental hospitals

32:06.525 --> 32:07.958
starting at the age of 8.

32:07.960 --> 32:10.294
Holy...

32:10.296 --> 32:11.995
Now, you mentioned
mental institutions

32:11.997 --> 32:13.363
in the '40s and '50s.

32:13.365 --> 32:15.565
Now, Wilkerson was born in '38,

32:15.567 --> 32:17.734
so the time frame matches.

32:17.736 --> 32:20.504
Unfortunately, in the '60s,
he started killing.

32:20.506 --> 32:23.874
In 1965, he beat, strangled,
and raped a 19-year-old girl

32:23.876 --> 32:25.309
a couple of miles from here

32:25.311 --> 32:28.412
while her 2-year-old son
slept in the other room.

32:28.414 --> 32:30.047
A few weeks later,
this sick bastard

32:30.049 --> 32:32.182
breaks into
an older couple's house

32:32.184 --> 32:34.284
less than a mile from here.

32:34.286 --> 32:36.720
He beats the man to death.

32:36.722 --> 32:40.123
Then he raped and badly beat
his wife, leaving her for dead.

32:40.125 --> 32:42.793
She survived. Barely, though.

32:42.795 --> 32:45.562
She was never right again
and couldn't identify him.

32:45.564 --> 32:48.365
Now, in 1975, he struck again.

32:48.367 --> 32:51.268
Now, this time, his victim
was a 28-year-old student

32:51.270 --> 32:53.103
named Geraldine Martin.

32:53.105 --> 32:55.472
He wound up raping
and murdering her, too.

32:55.474 --> 32:59.242
This guy may have killed more,
but that's all they got him on.

32:59.244 --> 33:01.912
Now, he wasn't
arrested until 2002.

33:01.914 --> 33:04.314
Holy...

33:04.316 --> 33:08.151
I got a great mug shot
array of him

33:08.153 --> 33:11.488
from when he was younger
to when he was older.

33:11.490 --> 33:15.525
Now, what do you think?
Is this who you might have seen?

33:15.527 --> 33:16.893
Yes.

33:16.895 --> 33:19.496
This just blows
my -- my mind.

33:19.498 --> 33:20.664
And when did he die?

33:20.666 --> 33:23.667
Last year.

33:23.669 --> 33:27.571
Everything started happening
about a year ago here,

33:27.573 --> 33:30.173
like, real bad.

33:30.175 --> 33:31.608
That makes me
totally disgusted.

33:31.610 --> 33:34.211
I don't want this guy
around my kid.

33:34.213 --> 33:37.481
I agree.

33:37.483 --> 33:42.619
The next guy that I encountered,
I felt, was the bigger threat.

33:42.621 --> 33:46.256
The way he showed himself
was extremely disturbing.

33:46.258 --> 33:49.059
He looked like a skeleton,
and it looked like

33:49.061 --> 33:52.562
he had burns all over his body.

33:52.564 --> 33:55.932
And this skeleton guy

33:55.934 --> 33:58.268
was not a good person in life.

33:58.270 --> 34:01.238
He said that he did kill people.

34:01.240 --> 34:02.839
Because of how he looked,

34:02.841 --> 34:05.575
I believe he had
a really gruesome death,

34:05.577 --> 34:07.944
and I think the thing
that killed him

34:07.946 --> 34:12.181
- was actually a broken neck.
- I have history that I really

34:12.184 --> 34:14.583
don't think has anything to do
with who she's talking about,

34:14.585 --> 34:16.786
but I think it's something
you guys should know about.

34:16.789 --> 34:18.755
Now, the day after
the attacks on Pearl Harbor,

34:18.757 --> 34:22.059
the military came in
and enforced eminent domain

34:22.061 --> 34:23.427
and took over all the property,

34:23.429 --> 34:26.329
and then they created
two military bases here.

34:26.331 --> 34:27.864
One camp was La Mesa.

34:27.866 --> 34:30.734
The other one was right next
to your old property line,

34:30.735 --> 34:32.735
and that's called
Gillespie Field now.

34:32.737 --> 34:34.004
According to the expert
I talked to,

34:34.005 --> 34:37.808
there have been
13 separate accidents there

34:37.810 --> 34:40.610
that killed 24 people.

34:40.612 --> 34:42.245
One stood to me was this one.

34:42.246 --> 34:46.416
It was an F-14 in 1988
that malfunctioned

34:46.418 --> 34:48.418
and began spinning
out of control.

34:48.420 --> 34:51.254
When the two pilots
ejected from the airplane,

34:51.255 --> 34:54.623
one of them broke
his neck upon impact.

34:54.626 --> 34:55.792
Any chance one of these deaths

34:55.793 --> 34:58.095
could have been
the skeleton guy you saw?

34:58.097 --> 35:01.164
No. Mnh-mnh.

35:01.166 --> 35:03.733
Okay. So now we have an idea
who it's not.

35:03.735 --> 35:06.503
So why is this skeleton guy
such a big threat?

35:06.505 --> 35:08.271
When I first got here,
he told me

35:08.273 --> 35:11.208
that he causes pain and death.

35:11.210 --> 35:14.411
He did get physical with me
a couple of times,

35:14.413 --> 35:17.280
and I do believe
that he's very capable

35:17.282 --> 35:20.450
of becoming physical
with living people.

35:20.452 --> 35:24.921
One of the things that I saw
and felt this skeleton guy does

35:24.923 --> 35:28.024
is, like, slapping and pushing

35:28.026 --> 35:30.961
and hitting people.

35:30.963 --> 35:33.763
The other thing I saw
was he was wrapping his hands

35:33.765 --> 35:35.999
around the bottom
of the feet and the ankles

35:36.001 --> 35:39.803
and pulling them out of bed.

35:39.805 --> 35:41.104
Tell Amy what happened.

35:41.106 --> 35:44.474
I was laying there,
and I got a grab on my ankle,

35:44.476 --> 35:46.343
a real tight grab.

35:46.345 --> 35:48.645
- Really?
- And it scared me to death.

35:48.647 --> 35:50.680
Well, you even wake up
with scratches and bruises.

35:50.682 --> 35:52.048
- Yeah.
- Okay.

35:52.050 --> 35:54.951
Lookit. Here's one of the
scratches she took pictures of.

35:54.953 --> 35:55.986
Wow.

35:55.988 --> 35:57.420
That's, like, nothing.

35:57.422 --> 36:01.024
And matter of fact,
Charlie wakes up

36:01.026 --> 36:04.294
with bruises on him.

36:04.296 --> 36:06.229
Yeah, I know.

36:09.501 --> 36:13.336
Okay. So, the other thing
that I saw him doing

36:13.338 --> 36:16.473
was possessing
a living male here.

36:18.777 --> 36:21.411
He can enter the body
and take over

36:21.413 --> 36:23.980
and completely change
his personality,

36:23.982 --> 36:27.484
and that would be becoming
angry and violent.

36:27.486 --> 36:31.922
I go from zero to angry
in 0.5 seconds.

36:31.924 --> 36:35.325
Do you notice, when he does
that, any physical changes?

36:35.327 --> 36:37.194
Yes. If we're fighting,

36:37.196 --> 36:40.864
he has this specific face
where he looks at me,

36:40.866 --> 36:45.468
almost like a disgust,
the way he squints his eyes.

36:45.470 --> 36:48.738
The other thing
that I saw him doing was,

36:48.740 --> 36:50.240
we went into the little room,

36:50.242 --> 36:51.841
- the little blue room.
- Yep, yep.

36:51.843 --> 36:53.777
And that blue room's
Charlie's room, right?

36:53.779 --> 36:56.546
It's the one
he won't sleep in.

36:56.548 --> 37:00.050
And what I saw
was very disturbing.

37:00.052 --> 37:03.954
I did have a sketch done of what
I saw happening in there.

37:12.297 --> 37:14.097
Jesus.

37:16.835 --> 37:20.503
I don't even want
to show it to them.

37:20.505 --> 37:21.972
My gosh.

37:27.713 --> 37:30.347
I want to say that it's
a surprising picture,

37:30.349 --> 37:34.050
but the way he thrashes
around at night.

37:34.052 --> 37:37.354
He's always saying,
"No. Stop. Get away."

37:37.356 --> 37:38.955
So what's he doing
in this picture?

37:38.957 --> 37:40.390
He was trying to smother him.

37:40.392 --> 37:43.960
He was covering his mouth,
pinching his nose.

37:43.962 --> 37:49.532
Obviously, he's trying
to kill your child.

37:49.534 --> 37:53.436
I did get that sometimes
the kid would wake up

37:53.438 --> 37:55.939
and would actually
see him in his room,

37:55.941 --> 37:58.341
and he was crying,
and it scares him.

38:00.479 --> 38:03.680
That's just...disgusting.
That pisses me off to no end.

38:03.682 --> 38:06.950
I can't -- I mean --

38:06.952 --> 38:10.553
Yeah.
I don't even have any words.

38:10.555 --> 38:12.856
I'm extremely,
extremely worried,

38:12.858 --> 38:16.359
because this guy wants death,

38:16.361 --> 38:20.563
and he wants to be able
to jump the living male here

38:20.565 --> 38:22.699
and have basically, you know,

38:22.701 --> 38:27.003
a murder-suicide
kind of situation.

38:27.005 --> 38:28.438
He showed me
where he enters you.

38:28.440 --> 38:31.274
He said it's on your
right side right here.

38:31.276 --> 38:35.845
I get rib pain on that side
all the time.

38:35.847 --> 38:39.182
I don't even know
what to say to you guys.

38:39.184 --> 38:40.717
This is bad.

38:40.719 --> 38:44.554
This is -- It is. Bad.

38:44.556 --> 38:47.290
Would I be able to just,
like, have just maybe

38:47.292 --> 38:48.992
- a minute or two?
- Yeah.

39:08.013 --> 39:09.479
Now, Melissa, you called us in

39:09.481 --> 39:12.682
because you wanted us
to save your son.

39:12.684 --> 39:16.720
But as it turns out,
your entire family is in danger.

39:16.722 --> 39:18.321
And I know taking care
of your grandfather

39:18.323 --> 39:21.324
means everything to you,
but I don't know how

39:21.326 --> 39:23.593
you're going to be able
to do that here safely.

39:23.595 --> 39:25.995
For that answer, I'm going
to turn it over to Amy.

39:29.901 --> 39:33.069
So, I'm very worried.

39:33.071 --> 39:37.874
My suggestion is that you leave
as soon as possible.

39:40.412 --> 39:43.480
You guys need to put
a lot of distance

39:43.482 --> 39:46.616
between here and where you go.

39:46.618 --> 39:51.287
But before entering
a new place of residence,

39:51.289 --> 39:54.357
you need to have a male

39:54.359 --> 39:57.994
who is a psychic
and a reiki master,

39:57.996 --> 40:01.364
because this skeleton guy,

40:01.366 --> 40:05.902
he showed me that he has entered
you on several occasions.

40:08.039 --> 40:09.739
There could be cords there.

40:09.741 --> 40:11.808
And the psychic reiki master

40:11.810 --> 40:15.945
will be doing a cord removal
and cutting.

40:15.947 --> 40:18.314
This can be painful,

40:18.316 --> 40:21.618
but you'll feel so much better
after it's done.

40:21.620 --> 40:23.420
Now, what about Charlie?

40:23.422 --> 40:27.857
Other than obviously
removing him from this location,

40:27.859 --> 40:32.262
he is clear right now.

40:32.264 --> 40:35.098
Now, what about Melissa? Does
she have to do anything, or --

40:37.102 --> 40:40.136
No. Mnh-mnh.

40:40.138 --> 40:42.172
What are the chances
Gene's going to come with you,

40:42.174 --> 40:44.007
your grandfather?

40:44.009 --> 40:45.275
I don't think
they're very high.

40:45.277 --> 40:49.045
I'll try to get him
to come with us, but...

40:49.047 --> 40:52.315
I don't know that
he's going to want to go.

40:52.317 --> 40:54.451
You said something to me
the other day

40:54.453 --> 40:57.454
that I thought about
for a long time.

40:57.456 --> 40:59.989
He's 85, and he has
lived his life,

40:59.991 --> 41:02.425
and my son hasn't, so...

41:02.427 --> 41:05.128
So, the main thing is,
you called us in for Charlie.

41:05.130 --> 41:07.330
So my question to you is,
if they move

41:07.332 --> 41:09.399
and they do everything
you tell them to do,

41:09.401 --> 41:11.367
this kid should have
a normal life, Charlie?

41:11.369 --> 41:13.303
Yes,
as long as y'all do

41:13.305 --> 41:15.071
everything I'm telling you
to do.

41:15.073 --> 41:16.840
I had already
made up my mind

41:16.842 --> 41:18.675
if it was going to be something
like this

41:18.677 --> 41:22.045
- that we were going to leave.
- Absolutely. We're gone.

41:22.047 --> 41:24.814
The kids come first,

41:24.816 --> 41:28.952
and they got to have
a normal childhood.

41:28.954 --> 41:31.554
The only way this family
can remain safe

41:31.556 --> 41:34.691
is to move as far away
as possible.

41:34.693 --> 41:37.327
They also need to contact
a psychic reiki master

41:37.329 --> 41:39.729
to break Corey's
negative attachments.

41:39.731 --> 41:43.166
If they do that, they can leave
the skeleton man behind

41:43.168 --> 41:45.902
and begin a peaceful life
somewhere else.
