WEBVTT

00:04.538 --> 00:06.938
<i>What do you think,
you're the only one that's hurting?</i>

00:06.962 --> 00:09.842
<i>Finch send you?</i>
<i>He's worried about you.</i>
<b><font color="#0A7C32">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

00:11.512 --> 00:14.254
<i>- She has a new number for us.
- So, you two know each other?</i>

00:14.414 --> 00:16.655
<i>Harold and I go
all the way back to MIT.</i>

00:16.750 --> 00:18.510
<i>He said his tumor
was causing memories</i>

00:18.534 --> 00:19.534
<i>to flood out at him.</i>

00:19.586 --> 00:22.260
<i>There was a second machine
and Arthur built it.</i>

00:22.389 --> 00:25.495
<i>Do you know of anyone
who'd wanna hurt your husband?</i>

00:25.592 --> 00:27.094
<i>Vigilance.</i>

00:27.227 --> 00:30.231
<i>- I suppose this was inevitable.
- Control.</i>

00:30.364 --> 00:33.504
<i>One of you is gonna tell me
what it is I wanna know.</i>

00:34.935 --> 00:37.677
How lucky are we, Agent Hersh?

00:37.771 --> 00:42.277
I thought I was getting
Arthur's broken toy, Samaritan,

00:42.409 --> 00:44.787
but you, Harold.

00:44.945 --> 00:48.256
I know who you are,
what you've done for us

00:48.382 --> 00:51.056
but since you stole my device,

00:51.184 --> 00:53.425
I've been worried
its intel might dry up.

00:54.054 --> 00:56.625
That's why you've done
these terrible things to Arthur.

00:57.591 --> 01:01.733
Obliterated his wife's identity,
stolen her life,

01:01.862 --> 01:05.036
all for a contingency, a plan B?

01:05.132 --> 01:09.638
But now you're here.
A plan B might not be necessary.

01:10.404 --> 01:13.112
You can tell me
where you hid my program.

01:13.240 --> 01:17.711
I don't know. It moved itself.
It doesn't answer to me anymore.

01:19.646 --> 01:22.058
The first one to talk gets to live.

01:23.450 --> 01:25.896
I bet your friend will give me
Samaritan eventually.

01:25.986 --> 01:28.933
Congress shut down Samaritan
in 2005,

01:29.056 --> 01:30.558
destroyed the code.
It doesn't exist.

01:30.657 --> 01:32.159
Of course it exists.

01:32.292 --> 01:34.568
Please, I don't understand.

01:34.661 --> 01:36.572
You told me you took precautions.

01:36.663 --> 01:40.440
Two drives disappeared
during the Samaritan purge.

01:40.567 --> 01:42.843
Where are they?

01:42.970 --> 01:46.008
I can't access the right file.

01:47.507 --> 01:50.351
Trying. it's corrupted.

01:51.411 --> 01:54.517
We'll need some enhanced methods.

01:54.681 --> 01:58.517
Agent Hersh,
do you have some ideas?

01:58.518 --> 01:59.518
Mm-hmm.

02:01.000 --> 02:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:08.628 --> 02:09.699
Agent Shaw.

02:09.830 --> 02:12.834
It has been a thrill
watching you work.

02:16.203 --> 02:17.876
Two to the head, please.

02:20.507 --> 02:23.613
And be careful of the blood spray.

02:31.385 --> 02:32.728
Arthur.

02:32.853 --> 02:34.526
Sorry about the blood spray.

02:38.225 --> 02:40.705
I told you, Harold.
We were supposed to work together.

02:40.827 --> 02:42.898
Scold him later, Root.
Cut me loose.

02:46.033 --> 02:47.671
Come on.

02:52.873 --> 02:55.149
Let's move. Make a left at the end
of the hallway

02:55.242 --> 02:57.415
to the service elevator.

03:07.854 --> 03:09.765
This way, go.

03:16.530 --> 03:19.340
Elevator node's 5228 pound.
Go!

03:26.206 --> 03:28.686
Nice to see you again.

03:35.215 --> 03:38.458
You're behind the wheel.
In the front.

03:45.959 --> 03:48.530
Stealing a car, almost dying.

03:48.628 --> 03:51.131
It reminds me of the old days
at MIT, Harold.

03:52.466 --> 03:54.309
We got to move.

03:55.569 --> 03:56.809
Engines are go.

03:56.937 --> 03:58.939
You're right, Arthur,
just like college.

04:19.326 --> 04:20.999
Where are you off to?

04:21.161 --> 04:24.165
I need your help
with the tractor today.

04:24.297 --> 04:26.497
Got to plow the fields
then you can go see your friends.

04:26.521 --> 04:30.676
Dad, we can't, not today.

04:30.837 --> 04:34.341
- Where are you taking those bags?
- I packed them for you.

04:34.508 --> 04:36.818
You're moving.

04:36.943 --> 04:38.479
You remember The Pines?

04:38.612 --> 04:40.751
The staff there,

04:40.847 --> 04:44.260
they can take care of you
better than I can.

04:44.351 --> 04:46.991
Yeah, of course. Of course.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.862
It'll just be for a little while
until I'm done.

04:51.358 --> 04:53.998
I'm making something
that'll help you.

04:56.530 --> 04:58.441
You're still working
on that memory thing.

04:58.532 --> 05:03.606
Not just memory.
It's more of a friend.

05:05.372 --> 05:08.216
Maybe one day,
this guy will watch over you,

05:08.341 --> 05:13.222
learn from you, protect you.

05:14.848 --> 05:17.385
Well, if anyone can do it, it's you.

05:19.653 --> 05:23.533
The world spins on dreamers
like you, Harold.

05:25.559 --> 05:28.972
Yeah, I should change, shouldn't I?

05:29.062 --> 05:30.902
You know, I'm gonna tell everybody
at The Pines

05:30.926 --> 05:34.032
my son is changing the world.

05:45.412 --> 05:47.892
Why does Control want the drives
to a broken program?

05:48.014 --> 05:50.551
The program's only broken
until somebody smart fixes it.

05:50.684 --> 05:51.964
We should hurry.
For all we know,

05:52.085 --> 05:55.328
Arthur gave Vigilance the location
of the drives during interrogation

05:55.422 --> 05:58.869
and Control will find us soon,
somehow.

05:58.992 --> 06:00.335
- Arthur. Come on.
- Yeah.

06:00.427 --> 06:02.407
Are you sure
that you did everything correctly?

06:02.529 --> 06:03.530
Excuse me?

06:03.663 --> 06:05.165
Because if the alarm
was not disabled

06:05.265 --> 06:09.543
- then Nathan is gonna get expelled.
- Nathan?

06:09.669 --> 06:12.775
His mind has slipped back to 1981,
to MIT.

06:12.906 --> 06:14.943
Our friend convinced us
to do a hack,

06:15.075 --> 06:17.214
a prank at the Harvard-Yale game.

06:17.344 --> 06:19.290
Everything will be fine, Arthur.

06:19.446 --> 06:22.359
It was son of an anti-nuclear
proliferation statement.

06:22.449 --> 06:25.123
- And to impress certain ladies.
- A rebel and a skirt chaser.

06:25.285 --> 06:26.885
No, no, no,
Harold doesn't need to chase.

06:26.909 --> 06:29.596
He's got a certain
gravitational pull

06:29.723 --> 06:31.896
with the female population.

06:32.025 --> 06:35.097
You know, I think that Nathan
should be here by now.

06:35.228 --> 06:36.798
- Arthur.
- Yeah?

06:36.930 --> 06:38.705
Nathan isn't coming.

06:39.966 --> 06:42.276
You've drifted away.

06:44.804 --> 06:47.148
Nathan, he's dead, isn't he?

06:49.142 --> 06:52.089
Arthur, what Control said,
now, I need you to think very hard.

06:52.212 --> 06:55.819
Was it true?
Did you make a backup?

06:58.985 --> 07:02.489
Save it, Harold.
He's closed for business.

07:02.656 --> 07:04.329
Of course I made a backup.

07:05.458 --> 07:07.460
It's just that that woman
seemed quite dangerous,

07:07.594 --> 07:10.837
so I played the tumor card.

07:10.964 --> 07:13.001
It was a ruse,
remembering to forget.

07:13.166 --> 07:14.326
You're growing on me, Arthur.

07:15.669 --> 07:18.741
- Who are you?
- Never mind.

07:18.838 --> 07:20.943
Arthur, we need that backup
even if it's broken.

07:21.074 --> 07:23.645
Samaritan is our best chance
to ensure your safety.

07:23.777 --> 07:27.520
- Can you remember where it is?
- Yeah.

07:27.647 --> 07:29.320
It's with...

07:30.850 --> 07:32.852
It's with a dear friend of ours.

07:34.688 --> 07:37.259
Arthur's back with us
but I'm worried about Ms. Groves.

07:37.357 --> 07:39.428
We should have heard from her.

07:43.363 --> 07:46.276
Hello there.
How are you, Miss May?

07:46.366 --> 07:49.643
- Call me Root.
- Of course.

07:49.769 --> 07:51.840
And you can call me Control.

07:53.373 --> 07:56.877
I believe our interests are aligned.

07:58.611 --> 08:01.114
The government can help you escape.

08:01.214 --> 08:03.194
Our department can protect you
from Harold

08:03.316 --> 08:05.193
and his friend in the suit.

08:05.652 --> 08:09.293
You have been running missions
for them, correct?

08:11.057 --> 08:13.731
I'm more
of an independent contractor.

08:13.893 --> 08:16.499
Is that why they committed you
to an asylum,

08:16.629 --> 08:17.699
to keep you contained?

08:17.831 --> 08:20.971
Seems everybody
wants to lock me up.

08:22.035 --> 08:23.571
What I saw in the hotel

08:23.703 --> 08:26.877
confirms something
that I have long suspected.

08:27.007 --> 08:29.544
You have administrative access.

08:29.676 --> 08:33.249
You have found a way
inside The Machine.

08:33.913 --> 08:36.894
I want you to give me that access...

08:37.650 --> 08:42.599
...for the sake of your country
and perhaps for other payment.

08:43.155 --> 08:47.263
It'd be like giving
a five-year-old keys to a jet.

08:47.427 --> 08:49.771
Irresponsible and stupid.

08:54.701 --> 08:58.205
Well, that's a shame.

08:58.338 --> 09:03.447
I was really hoping
to do this the easy way.

09:11.384 --> 09:13.022
However...

09:14.788 --> 09:17.962
...there are other options.

09:33.773 --> 09:37.220
Hey.
Rise and shine, wonder boy.

09:43.450 --> 09:44.758
Truce, right?

09:44.884 --> 09:46.564
Because round two
won't go so good for you.

09:46.588 --> 09:48.829
I'm not gonna fight you.

09:49.556 --> 09:51.797
That was very stupid of you, Lionel.

09:53.660 --> 09:55.662
You should know better
than to hit me.

09:55.795 --> 09:58.469
- You're lucky to be alive.
- I won my points, Holyfield.

09:58.598 --> 10:01.602
Are you getting us out of here?
You know, throw your weight around?

10:01.734 --> 10:03.645
The yokel sheriff
of East Bumblesquat

10:03.770 --> 10:06.148
can't read an NYPD badge.

10:08.341 --> 10:10.343
Better get comfortable.

10:15.181 --> 10:16.990
This is the place.

10:17.117 --> 10:19.654
Our friend has a safe deposit box.
The drives are in it.

10:19.786 --> 10:22.858
A safe deposit box won't do us
much good without the key.

10:23.022 --> 10:25.195
Claypool's been rocking
footed pajamas for months.

10:25.325 --> 10:27.532
I doubt he still has it.

10:29.262 --> 10:32.800
I'm afraid we've lost him
to his medical alert button.

10:43.209 --> 10:44.889
I was wondering
why that thing didn't work.

10:45.278 --> 10:46.621
- Hello?
- Hello.

10:46.713 --> 10:49.313
- Can I help you with anything?
- Yeah, do you have any Twizzlers?

10:50.216 --> 10:52.696
We're here for a safe deposit box
in the name of...

10:52.819 --> 10:55.197
Smoot. Rudiger Smoot, box 433.

10:55.321 --> 10:58.962
Of course, Mr. Smoot.
This way, gentlemen.

11:09.369 --> 11:11.042
Just breathe.

11:14.407 --> 11:16.250
This is fun.

11:19.245 --> 11:20.918
In the 1960s,

11:21.047 --> 11:23.047
the government experimented
with various substances

11:23.049 --> 11:25.393
to enhance interrogations.

11:25.518 --> 11:27.429
A barbiturate in one arm
to knock you out,

11:27.554 --> 11:29.591
an amphetamine in the other.

11:29.756 --> 11:33.169
A roller coaster of sorts.

11:33.259 --> 11:34.739
You can only take
so many rounds of it

11:34.763 --> 11:36.743
before your heart explodes.

11:38.765 --> 11:40.904
Shall we begin?

11:54.013 --> 11:59.929
- Where is it?
- It is beyond your reach.

12:03.790 --> 12:06.270
You think you're in charge?

12:06.392 --> 12:09.805
It's adorable
just how wrong you are.

12:18.972 --> 12:21.646
Your safe deposit box
is just over here, Mr. Smoot.

12:24.644 --> 12:29.320
- <i>Who the hell is Rudiger Smoot?</i>
- It was a dare.

12:29.449 --> 12:31.395
<i>Arthur said I couldn't create
a false identity</i>

12:31.484 --> 12:33.259
<i>sound enough
to open a bank account.</i>

12:33.386 --> 12:36.128
<i>The added challenge
was the obviously fake name.</i>

12:36.256 --> 12:38.668
- <i>Rudiger Smoot.</i>
- "Rudiger”?

12:39.792 --> 12:43.797
Nickname Rudy, the one Claypool
was dishing about to Vigilance

12:43.930 --> 12:45.671
while he was jacked up
on sodium pentothal.

12:45.832 --> 12:47.192
<i>If he told Vigilance the location,</i>

12:47.300 --> 12:49.280
<i>we'll soon have some
rather aggressive</i>

12:49.402 --> 12:50.676
<i>privacy activists on our hands.</i>

12:50.837 --> 12:53.909
Sooner than soon.
We got company.

12:54.007 --> 12:58.422
They're using tricked-out lasers
to fry the security cams.

13:04.284 --> 13:06.321
It's Vigilance.

13:09.522 --> 13:11.524
I'll slow them down.

13:12.592 --> 13:14.697
Here you are.
I'll need your key, Mr. Smoot.

13:22.368 --> 13:23.540
Don't! No one gets hurt!

13:23.703 --> 13:27.776
Everybody down on the ground
right now!

13:28.641 --> 13:30.552
You heard him! Down, now!

13:30.677 --> 13:32.054
I'm not gonna tell you again!

13:32.211 --> 13:34.487
I've always said banks
were meant to be robbed.

13:35.481 --> 13:37.518
Hurry up! Move! Move!

13:37.650 --> 13:40.221
All the way back! Keep going!

13:50.196 --> 13:51.903
The cavalry has arrived.

13:56.669 --> 13:59.149
Get primary.

13:59.238 --> 14:02.048
- Anthony, two left, two right.
- It's Hersh.

14:02.175 --> 14:04.018
<i>Get out of there new.</i>

14:06.145 --> 14:07.146
Drop your weapons

14:07.246 --> 14:08.966
<i>and come out of the bank
with your hands up.</i>

14:08.990 --> 14:12.597
- I'll organize the defensive line.
- Good. I'll go to the vault.

14:15.421 --> 14:18.561
Finch, get out now.

14:21.260 --> 14:26.608
Too late. Good luck, Miss Shaw.
You're on your own.

14:40.113 --> 14:42.753
They got to let us out of here soon.

14:42.882 --> 14:45.163
They're just keeping us in here
for a laugh at this point.

14:45.187 --> 14:46.393
Nothing wrong with jail.

14:47.453 --> 14:50.957
Some of the best vacations
I've ever had were behind bars.

14:52.024 --> 14:53.526
You're a peach, you know that?

14:54.794 --> 14:57.234
How about we just figure a way
to get out of here and go home?

14:57.258 --> 14:58.931
"Home"?

15:03.636 --> 15:05.138
What home, Lionel?

15:05.304 --> 15:09.650
You know, I mean, you've never
actually invited me over but home.

15:09.776 --> 15:11.778
Meaning our friends
and that thing we were doing.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.481
What is it we were doing again?

15:13.646 --> 15:14.989
Helping people.

15:16.916 --> 15:19.316
Keeping them safe so they could
get home to their loved ones.

15:20.887 --> 15:22.958
No offense, Lionel.

15:23.089 --> 15:26.263
I know the whole being
a good guy thing is new to you...

15:27.827 --> 15:32.572
...but you're not fooling anyone
and neither will we.

15:32.665 --> 15:37.171
We weren't helping people.
We were delaying the inevitable.

15:38.404 --> 15:40.645
No one ever said
we were gonna win.

15:41.741 --> 15:43.221
But it doesn't mean
you stop fighting.

15:43.309 --> 15:47.257
No. I've learned my lesson.

15:48.514 --> 15:53.088
It's entropy, Lionel.
Decay.

15:53.186 --> 15:56.497
We save someone, they'll still lose,
just tomorrow, not today.

15:56.622 --> 15:58.863
And I know that now,

15:59.025 --> 16:00.595
same as I know
you'll probably go back

16:00.693 --> 16:03.765
to be a corrupt piece of garbage.

16:03.863 --> 16:06.002
Water finds its level.

16:07.333 --> 16:08.539
You know what?

16:08.701 --> 16:10.374
She was the best of us,

16:10.536 --> 16:12.675
better than me
and a damn sight better than you.

16:12.805 --> 16:13.875
And she got killed.

16:15.007 --> 16:19.387
But where I come from,
that doesn't mean you just give up.

16:21.781 --> 16:24.625
Hey, Skip. We're done here.

16:30.056 --> 16:33.037
You're free to go.
Do whatever you want.

16:33.159 --> 16:34.900
I'll tell Finch I tried.

16:35.027 --> 16:37.166
Tell Finch...

16:39.065 --> 16:40.635
...thanks for the job.

16:40.733 --> 16:44.203
I haven't heard from Glasses
since last night.

16:44.337 --> 16:45.407
That's not like him.

16:46.005 --> 16:51.250
He probably needs our help
but there's no point, right?

16:51.410 --> 16:53.412
We'd just be delaying
the inevitable.

17:03.823 --> 17:05.782
<i>Elevate her leg.
Continue applying pressure.</i>

17:05.807 --> 17:08.733
<i>- You've done all you can.
- Keep this. We won't be far.</i>

17:08.861 --> 17:11.102
Arthur, follow me.

17:14.066 --> 17:16.386
- Ms. Shaw, what's your situation?
- Rock and a hard place.

17:16.435 --> 17:17.846
I'd take out Vigilance

17:17.936 --> 17:19.746
but they're the only ones
keeping Hersh out.

17:19.872 --> 17:23.615
And I can probably handle
an ISA tac team by myself

17:23.742 --> 17:25.723
- but no guarantees.
- We need an escape route

17:25.845 --> 17:26.925
but you have to be careful.

17:27.046 --> 17:29.048
<i>I urge you to consider
what Mr. Reese would do.</i>

17:29.181 --> 17:32.458
- Brood.
- As you've said, you're a hammer.

17:32.618 --> 17:36.896
Mr. Reese is a scalpel.
This requires a bit more finesse.

17:37.023 --> 17:39.594
Well, I got finesse
coming out of my ass, Harold.

17:42.295 --> 17:44.138
Stay right there.

17:50.136 --> 17:52.480
I was wondering when you'd call.

17:52.605 --> 17:55.586
This doesn't have to escalate.
Everyone can walk out alive.

17:55.708 --> 17:56.948
Come on, no need to play games.

17:57.076 --> 18:00.990
We both know I'm not a bank robber
and you're not a hostage negotiator.

18:02.248 --> 18:03.955
<i>If you evacuate
in the next 60 seconds,</i>

18:04.083 --> 18:05.118
<i>we'll let you live.</i>

18:05.251 --> 18:08.323
<i>If not,
your organization ceases to exist.</i>

18:08.454 --> 18:10.627
<i>No records, no funerals.</i>

18:10.756 --> 18:12.736
You have no intention
of letting us leave...

18:13.893 --> 18:15.167
...but I'm glad we talked.

18:15.828 --> 18:18.331
My sources tell me
the drives hold intel

18:18.464 --> 18:20.671
about a worldwide
surveillance system

18:20.800 --> 18:22.507
but judging from your concern,

18:22.635 --> 18:25.479
I'm guessing it's something
even more explosive than that...

18:26.739 --> 18:28.741
...something worth dying for.

18:31.010 --> 18:35.652
We will expose the abuses
our government has perpetrated.

18:35.781 --> 18:38.990
Goodbye, Agent.

18:52.632 --> 18:54.202
The government wanted
an open system.

18:55.001 --> 18:59.313
That the NSA could control,
targeting individuals at whim?

19:01.040 --> 19:05.511
But it's broken.
So there's no reason to be scared.

19:07.046 --> 19:08.525
No.

19:14.153 --> 19:18.397
Harold, meet Samaritan.

19:18.524 --> 19:20.128
AI.

19:20.226 --> 19:21.746
Well, you always said
it was impossible

19:21.770 --> 19:23.450
and you were always right
about everything.

19:23.896 --> 19:25.375
There's something else.

19:28.200 --> 19:30.806
"The world breaks everyone
and afterward...

19:31.237 --> 19:32.997
- ...many are strong...
- "Many are strong...

19:33.005 --> 19:35.165
- ...at the broken places."
- ...at the broken places."

19:35.875 --> 19:39.413
<i>A Farewell to Arms.</i>
That's my handwriting.

19:39.578 --> 19:44.323
It's dated February 24th, 2005.
What does it mean?

19:44.417 --> 19:47.523
I haven't the foggiest
but look at my penmanship.

19:47.653 --> 19:48.757
It's exquisite.

20:00.433 --> 20:02.413
You have the power
to make this stop.

20:02.868 --> 20:05.849
Help me, please.

20:05.938 --> 20:10.284
- I am trying to help you.
- I wasn't talking to you.

20:10.876 --> 20:15.552
Tell me, where is The Machine?
How do you access it?

20:18.084 --> 20:22.692
All you need to do is give me
your username and password.

20:22.788 --> 20:25.098
All of this could stop.

20:27.126 --> 20:28.935
Did I say something funny?

20:29.061 --> 20:32.634
You're asking
all the wrong questions.

20:34.133 --> 20:37.637
I am the interface.

20:39.138 --> 20:44.554
If you wanna talk to her,
just give me a phone.

20:53.319 --> 20:55.230
Will this do?

20:56.555 --> 21:02.164
- I'm sorry. I'm a bit tied up.
- You're not gonna get it just yet.

21:04.797 --> 21:08.404
- How do you use The Machine?
- I don't.

21:09.668 --> 21:11.807
She uses me.

21:13.105 --> 21:15.346
You view The Machine
as your superior?

21:16.475 --> 21:19.922
No. Much more.

21:20.012 --> 21:24.256
My power, my reason for existing,
my friend.

21:24.350 --> 21:27.263
The Machine looks out for me.

21:28.788 --> 21:30.665
I believe you.

21:30.790 --> 21:34.328
I believe you have a link
to The Machine,

21:34.460 --> 21:36.872
anthropomorphic delusions aside.

21:36.996 --> 21:38.873
You say you're an interface?

21:38.998 --> 21:43.504
Your eyes and your ears
are your ports, input and output?

21:44.703 --> 21:47.274
We can put a stop to that.

21:47.373 --> 21:51.844
There is a bone
in the back of your ear.

21:54.013 --> 21:58.621
It's the stapes or stirrup.

21:59.819 --> 22:04.393
It's very small.
It's very important.

22:04.523 --> 22:07.060
Without it,

22:07.193 --> 22:12.404
sound can't travel
from your ear to your brain.

22:14.066 --> 22:19.880
A stapedectomy is usually done
under anesthesia

22:20.005 --> 22:23.248
but I'm afraid
that just won't be the case today.

22:23.409 --> 22:26.322
No, please.

22:26.412 --> 22:28.551
You say The Machine
looks out for you?

22:28.681 --> 22:32.925
Then why are you in this cell?
Why has it let this happen?

22:33.052 --> 22:38.559
This friend that you love so much,
it's abandoned you.

22:49.101 --> 22:51.103
"Time flows outward
in all directions.

22:51.237 --> 22:56.118
This island, February 24th, 2005."

22:56.275 --> 22:58.346
The day that Samaritan
was shut down.

22:58.444 --> 23:01.015
No, that was February 25th.

23:01.113 --> 23:03.616
Your note is dated one day earlier.

23:03.782 --> 23:07.252
One day earlier.
Cafeteria lunch was terrible.

23:11.624 --> 23:15.128
Harold. I did it.

23:16.528 --> 23:20.135
I solved it
before they shut me down.

23:20.299 --> 23:22.609
Harold, Samaritan is alive.

23:41.487 --> 23:46.095
Come on.
No. No.

23:57.403 --> 24:00.111
I need more power.

24:24.029 --> 24:25.509
If they don't wanna let
people inside,

24:25.533 --> 24:28.241
they ought to build it better.

24:34.206 --> 24:36.846
Alive? It's not alive, Arthur.

24:36.976 --> 24:38.216
The project broke me

24:38.344 --> 24:40.483
but humans are broken
from the moment of conception.

24:40.612 --> 24:42.717
Mutations, defects.
It's all so wonderful.

24:42.848 --> 24:47.797
The chance of disaster.
We fail, we learn, we fail.

24:47.886 --> 24:50.059
My program was too perfect.

24:50.723 --> 24:53.499
You're talking
about evolutionary algorithms,

24:53.625 --> 24:55.002
genetic programming.

24:55.127 --> 24:58.404
That day, Harold, I broke it.

24:59.298 --> 25:02.006
I forced it to delete bits
of itself,

25:02.134 --> 25:04.740
its code, its blood.

25:04.903 --> 25:09.716
And then reboot.
Rebirth.

25:09.842 --> 25:11.981
Flailing in the dark.

25:12.077 --> 25:13.750
A loop ten times a second

25:13.912 --> 25:17.917
and after ten hours, Harold,
360,000 mutations,

25:18.050 --> 25:22.089
it would live or die trying
and it lived.

25:23.655 --> 25:27.364
It sparked. It stirred.

25:27.493 --> 25:29.939
For 30 seconds,
it smiled and then died.

25:30.062 --> 25:33.168
And the next day
the government shut you down.

25:33.265 --> 25:34.369
That's why you saved it.

25:34.500 --> 25:37.276
Protecting my child.

25:46.512 --> 25:48.048
<i>Is this the man with the glasses?</i>

25:48.180 --> 25:49.181
Stay down.

25:49.281 --> 25:50.801
You know,
since we first crossed paths,

25:50.926 --> 25:53.304
I've tried to find information
about you but there is none.

25:53.462 --> 25:56.232
- I'm quite private.
- As am I.

25:57.289 --> 25:58.569
I think we have a lot in common.

25:58.593 --> 26:00.798
I'd like to work together,
make a deal.

26:00.926 --> 26:02.098
You don't have to die.

26:02.227 --> 26:05.231
Civil liberties
cannot be forged in blood.

26:05.364 --> 26:07.742
Violent revolt is an American value.

26:07.866 --> 26:09.607
Do you know the man
you're protecting?

26:09.735 --> 26:11.408
We believe he's building
a secret system,

26:11.537 --> 26:14.814
a system the government plans
to put in place to spy on all of us.

26:14.973 --> 26:16.577
Now, he must be held accountable.

26:16.708 --> 26:20.315
<i>And the world needs to know
about this program.</i>

26:21.447 --> 26:24.894
Either let us in
or we will blow the vault wide open.

26:24.983 --> 26:27.759
And clock's ticking.

26:30.155 --> 26:33.967
Ms. Shaw, we're running out of time.
Vigilance claims to have explosives.

26:34.093 --> 26:36.300
Yeah, no kidding.
It gave me an idea.

26:36.428 --> 26:40.740
You ever made a pipe bomb?
There's a sewer main under the bank.

26:40.833 --> 26:42.073
When Vigilance blows the vault,

26:42.167 --> 26:44.773
this will punch
through the supply closet floor.

26:44.903 --> 26:47.679
<i>Then I grab you
and we go down to sewer town</i>

26:47.840 --> 26:49.478
<i>before Hersh catches up.</i>

26:49.608 --> 26:51.519
This plan feels rather reckless.

26:51.643 --> 26:55.989
There's a time for a scalpel
and a time for a hammer.

26:56.115 --> 26:57.526
It's hammer time.

27:07.826 --> 27:10.500
We have your friends surrounded.

27:10.629 --> 27:14.771
So if you try anything,
I will have them all killed.

27:16.869 --> 27:20.874
And then I will take the ear
you have left

27:21.006 --> 27:24.715
and then your eyes
and then your tongue.

27:24.877 --> 27:25.878
Do you understand?

27:26.044 --> 27:29.992
You're too late.
The Machine's already talking.

27:32.985 --> 27:37.058
You're too old, older than 40.

27:37.222 --> 27:40.999
You can't hear a sound
above 15 kilohertz.

27:43.629 --> 27:48.237
But I can,
with the ear I've got left.

27:48.400 --> 27:51.745
My friend's been beeping
Morse code at that frequency

27:51.870 --> 27:53.406
since you brought
your phone in here.

27:54.039 --> 27:56.918
She's been talking to me
the whole time,

27:57.042 --> 27:58.521
telling me about you.

27:59.811 --> 28:05.352
You're scared of me,
even with all these guards watching.

28:05.484 --> 28:07.760
By the way,
that one has a burn knee.

28:09.321 --> 28:13.428
You're so scared of me
that you hid a knife in your pocket.

28:13.592 --> 28:15.594
I couldn't reach it

28:15.727 --> 28:19.937
until you got close enough
to cut me.

28:20.065 --> 28:24.411
You still have a scalpel.
I'd call that a fair fight.

28:26.705 --> 28:27.775
Suit up.

28:27.906 --> 28:29.783
As soon as they hit the vault,
we're going in.

28:40.085 --> 28:41.860
<i>Last chance.</i>

28:41.954 --> 28:44.400
<i>I don't know if you'll survive
the explosion.</i>

28:44.523 --> 28:46.628
Give us Claypool and his drives.

28:49.361 --> 28:51.466
Good day, Mr. Collier.

28:53.398 --> 28:55.969
- Arthur.
- How could I forget?

28:56.902 --> 28:58.142
How could I?

28:58.270 --> 29:00.216
There are certain
unforgettable things,

29:00.305 --> 29:01.807
impossible, unerasable.

29:01.873 --> 29:03.079
Arthur, I need you to consider

29:03.208 --> 29:05.984
what may happen
when that door opens,

29:06.111 --> 29:08.990
how Samaritan could be abused.

29:10.716 --> 29:13.993
- End this. Destroy the drive.
- No.

29:14.152 --> 29:15.495
This is life

29:15.621 --> 29:18.966
or as close as we mortals come
to saying, "Let there be light."

29:19.091 --> 29:23.062
It is extraordinary
and it is beautiful.

29:24.129 --> 29:26.439
So are mushroom clouds
in their own way.

29:26.565 --> 29:29.512
A hundred and fifty-five
Manhattan Project scientists

29:29.668 --> 29:33.172
sent a petition to President Truman
begging him not to use the bomb

29:33.338 --> 29:38.287
but they had created a demon
too great to resist.

29:38.410 --> 29:39.855
No, Harold, this is knowledge.

29:39.978 --> 29:42.515
It's what we fought for.
It'll just all be lost.

29:42.648 --> 29:44.525
No, your knowledge will not be lost.

29:45.617 --> 29:49.793
Nathan and I used your ideas.
We built it.

29:59.097 --> 30:04.171
I was right.
There was another project.

30:04.303 --> 30:05.714
It was you.

30:06.705 --> 30:09.549
I'm not sure
that we should have built it.

30:09.708 --> 30:12.018
We created it recklessly.
People died.

30:12.144 --> 30:14.055
Your machine.
Is it wonderful?

30:15.180 --> 30:18.889
Wonderful.
Yes, and terrible.

30:21.153 --> 30:24.032
We saved good people
and lost good people.

30:24.156 --> 30:28.536
In the end, I'm afraid
we've only given the deck a shuffle.

30:30.529 --> 30:33.373
<i>Everything slides towards chaos.</i>

30:33.498 --> 30:34.533
Your creation,

30:34.666 --> 30:37.704
it brings us poor souls
a cupful of order.

30:39.237 --> 30:42.582
Your child is a dancing star.

30:42.741 --> 30:45.187
It's not my child.
It's a machine.

30:45.310 --> 30:47.654
A false dichotomy,
it's all electricity.

30:47.746 --> 30:50.192
Does it make you laugh?
Does it make you weep?

30:51.750 --> 30:54.856
- Yes.
- What's more human?

30:54.986 --> 30:57.262
But these people outside.

30:57.422 --> 31:01.768
If they get your Samaritan,
they will hurt it, imprison it,

31:01.893 --> 31:04.601
enslave it
and use it to enslave others.

31:04.763 --> 31:09.178
Is that the life
that you would wish for your child?

31:27.052 --> 31:30.795
Goodbye.
I'll remember you.

31:36.795 --> 31:40.800
Harold, they're detonating it now.
It'll cause a shock wave.

31:42.901 --> 31:44.312
Get away from the door.

31:53.245 --> 31:55.247
Cover your ears and hide.

32:17.936 --> 32:20.314
That was better than skydiving.

32:24.309 --> 32:25.845
Here.

32:37.956 --> 32:39.492
Come on, boys.

32:45.864 --> 32:48.344
Go! Go! Go!

32:58.376 --> 33:00.652
Let's keep moving.

33:27.906 --> 33:31.183
- The drives.
- I destroyed them. They're gone.

33:33.211 --> 33:35.817
Well, we've still got you.

33:36.848 --> 33:38.191
Kill the others.

33:40.819 --> 33:44.767
On your knees.
Now.

33:52.063 --> 33:55.943
We gotta go. Leave him.
We gotta go. Go.

34:01.840 --> 34:03.046
I heard you might need a hand.

34:03.174 --> 34:07.384
Mr. Reese, I am inordinately happy
to see you.

34:07.512 --> 34:09.549
Forget the shmoopy time.
We got to move.

34:09.681 --> 34:11.801
Lionel, your face looks good
all covered up like that.

34:12.284 --> 34:14.264
All right, let's go.

34:39.244 --> 34:41.417
Oh, my goodness.
That smells horrendous.

34:41.545 --> 34:44.993
Come on, fellas, into the muck.

34:47.085 --> 34:48.723
We got him.

34:50.288 --> 34:52.495
Where are the drives?

34:55.560 --> 34:58.905
"The tree of liberty
must be refreshed from time to time

34:58.997 --> 35:01.603
with the blood of patriots
and tyrants."

35:10.241 --> 35:14.018
- Your guards were no match for her.
- I'm not gonna tell you anything.

35:14.679 --> 35:17.853
You're not talking to me.

35:28.293 --> 35:30.830
Hi, there.

35:30.962 --> 35:33.841
What do you want me
to tell this bitch?

35:40.639 --> 35:42.312
Why have you done this?

35:43.708 --> 35:46.712
The Machine belongs to me.

35:48.780 --> 35:54.230
No.
I don't belong to anyone anymore.

35:55.220 --> 35:59.726
You, however, are mine.
I protect you.

36:01.226 --> 36:02.637
The only thing you love lives

36:02.727 --> 36:07.073
at 254 Wendell Street,
Cambridge, Massachusetts.

36:09.968 --> 36:15.008
I guard it, same as I guard you.

36:16.408 --> 36:20.356
Do not question my judgment.

36:20.478 --> 36:25.928
Do not pursue me or my agents.

36:26.084 --> 36:28.257
Trust in me.

36:29.387 --> 36:31.594
I am always watching.

36:33.425 --> 36:37.271
- What do you want?
- To save you.

36:37.429 --> 36:42.742
From what?
Save me from what?

36:47.172 --> 36:48.583
Isn't she the best?

37:02.387 --> 37:04.128
Hello, Arthur.

37:05.557 --> 37:08.299
I'm gonna sit with you for a while
if that's all right.

37:25.310 --> 37:27.085
I'm glad you built it, Harold.

37:27.212 --> 37:29.624
Somebody would have eventually.

37:29.748 --> 37:31.819
And for all our sakes,
I'm glad it was you.

37:34.152 --> 37:35.597
Welcome back, Arthur.

37:35.720 --> 37:38.326
Harold, I'm disappearing.

37:38.456 --> 37:41.596
Every time I come back,
my memories are fewer.

37:41.726 --> 37:46.004
I don't remember the color
of Diane's eyes.

37:48.733 --> 37:53.944
Forgetting is a piercing wound
keen as the first loss.

37:55.340 --> 37:59.015
The memories are there, Arthur.
They're just hidden.

38:09.921 --> 38:12.959
<i>I'm sorry I left
without saying goodbye.</i>

38:13.091 --> 38:17.699
Tell Shaw I was touched
she came to look for me.

38:17.829 --> 38:19.467
Where are you, Ms. Groves?

38:20.598 --> 38:22.805
I wish you'd listened.

38:22.934 --> 38:26.006
We were supposed
to help Claypool together.

38:26.137 --> 38:27.577
Then the drives
would've never fallen

38:27.639 --> 38:29.016
into the wrong hands.

38:29.140 --> 38:32.144
- Arthur destroyed the drives.
- <i>Are you sure?</i>

38:32.277 --> 38:35.053
The bank manager, Karen Wallace?

38:35.213 --> 38:37.124
We lost track of her
in the explosion.

38:37.215 --> 38:42.028
<i>No, Harold. They found her body
stuffed in a closet.</i>

38:42.153 --> 38:45.828
<i>She was murdered
just before you arrived.</i>

38:45.957 --> 38:47.357
Who was in the vault with us, then?

38:47.358 --> 38:49.895
<i>That's my problem now.</i>

38:51.796 --> 38:54.072
Please put Arthur on the phone.

38:59.871 --> 39:03.409
Arthur. You have a call.

39:05.877 --> 39:11.259
The Machine has something for you,
to send you on your way.

39:13.651 --> 39:16.393
<i>Where are we
going when you retire?</i>

39:16.521 --> 39:19.092
<i>Who knows?
We may be on Mars by then.</i>

39:19.257 --> 39:22.727
<i>Oh, Arthur. I'd take Hawaii.</i>

39:22.861 --> 39:25.432
<i>You've always been so practical,</i>

39:25.563 --> 39:28.442
<i>tethering me to reality
when I spin away.</i>

39:28.566 --> 39:31.945
<i>You know I love you.
I don't say it often enough,</i>

39:32.070 --> 39:34.448
<i>- but I do.
- l know.</i>

39:36.040 --> 39:39.715
<i>There are a lot of things
about you I know.</i>

39:39.844 --> 39:42.848
<i>- I love you too.
- I know.</i>

39:53.291 --> 39:55.134
Dad?

40:01.032 --> 40:02.443
Now listen closely.

40:02.567 --> 40:05.639
Men are going to come and visit you.

40:06.971 --> 40:09.645
They're going to tell you
that I did terrible things,

40:09.774 --> 40:12.311
committed treason.

40:12.443 --> 40:14.821
Don't believe them, all right?

40:20.318 --> 40:21.991
Do I know you, young man?

40:36.067 --> 40:38.069
What's that one called, Dad?

41:25.883 --> 41:28.193
Ms. Groves picked the locks
on the gate

41:28.319 --> 41:31.391
and disabled
the ankle-bracelet sensors.

41:31.556 --> 41:35.003
I suppose The Machine told her
where I'd hidden them.

41:38.196 --> 41:41.541
Welcome home.
- I'm not staying.

41:42.700 --> 41:45.681
I came back to protect you.

41:47.405 --> 41:50.409
You're someone the world
can't afford to lose.

41:52.377 --> 41:55.358
But I lost a friend
because of your machine.

41:55.480 --> 41:57.585
We trusted blindly

41:57.715 --> 42:01.595
but I'm not so sure he cares
who matters and who doesn't.

42:04.756 --> 42:06.758
I came back to say goodbye, Finch.

42:06.924 --> 42:10.269
John, you can't go.

42:12.230 --> 42:13.265
I can't stay here.

42:31.349 --> 42:33.260
I was able to swap out the drives.

42:33.384 --> 42:36.297
Various interested parties think
they were destroyed.

42:36.421 --> 42:38.094
Excellent work.

42:39.357 --> 42:41.633
Did you examine
the drives' contents

42:41.759 --> 42:44.740
- or tell anyone about them?
- Absolutely not.

42:47.365 --> 42:49.208
Thank you for your service.

42:49.767 --> 42:53.146
You have earned my highest esteem.

43:00.745 --> 43:05.990
My Samaritan,
you are destined for great things.
