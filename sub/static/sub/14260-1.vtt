All right, Michelangelo,
you've cowa'd your last bunga!

01:22.081 --> 01:23.281
Now way, dude.

01:23.283 --> 01:25.984
Prepare to be most
excellently thrashed.

01:28.587 --> 01:29.821
Whaaa-gee!

01:31.324 --> 01:34.125
Uh, what say we make it
two out of three?

01:41.267 --> 01:42.934
Ah! Ah!

01:42.936 --> 01:45.703
Come on, Leonardo,
why don't you attack me?

01:45.705 --> 01:48.573
What is the matter
with you?

01:48.575 --> 01:50.074
Why won't you
fight back?

01:51.877 --> 01:53.745
Whoa!

01:55.214 --> 01:57.982
Donatello, it appears
you have been defeated

01:57.984 --> 02:00.152
by the principle
of Wu-Wee.

02:00.154 --> 02:01.219
Wu-wah?

02:01.221 --> 02:03.321
Wu-Wee.

02:03.323 --> 02:05.590
It is an ancient
Oriental concept.

02:05.592 --> 02:08.059
The art
of Doing Without Action.

02:08.061 --> 02:10.728
Like, say again,
Master Splinter.

02:10.729 --> 02:12.230
By doing nothing,

02:12.232 --> 02:15.267
Leonardo turned Donatello's
assault against him,

02:15.269 --> 02:17.202
just as the gentlest waves

02:17.204 --> 02:20.372
will eventually wear away
the mightiest boulder.

02:20.374 --> 02:21.739
Whoa!

02:21.741 --> 02:25.777
Pretty heavy philosophical
stuff for a cartoon show.

02:28.147 --> 02:31.115
[Shredder]
Are we going to spend
the rest of our lives

02:31.117 --> 02:32.317
trapped in this blasted ice?

02:34.587 --> 02:35.987
I'm going
out of my mind.

02:35.989 --> 02:37.489
Lucky you.

02:37.491 --> 02:39.824
Me, I can't go out of my mind.

02:39.826 --> 02:41.993
It's all I've got.

02:41.995 --> 02:44.562
Nothing but snow
all around us.

02:44.564 --> 02:46.797
I can't take much
more of this.

02:48.934 --> 02:52.337
We thought you might
be feeling a little
down, boss.

02:52.339 --> 02:55.406
So, we made something
to cheer you up.

02:55.408 --> 02:56.908
Snow cones.

02:56.910 --> 02:59.643
Snow cones?

02:59.645 --> 03:02.146
Uh, we was only
tryin' to help!

03:02.148 --> 03:04.416
Then go do
something useful,

03:04.418 --> 03:05.917
like cleaning up
this place!

03:07.319 --> 03:10.522
I guess I could organize
my comic book collection.

03:10.524 --> 03:13.624
You mean <i> my</i> comic book
collection.

03:13.626 --> 03:16.361
Those are my
comic books!

03:16.363 --> 03:18.196
No, mine!

03:20.933 --> 03:22.567
<i>This is April O'Neal--</i>
Oh, what a team.

03:22.569 --> 03:23.702
<i>...Channel 6 News.</i>

03:23.704 --> 03:26.104
Those cretins are
fighting over comics,

03:26.106 --> 03:28.039
and you're watching TV.

03:28.041 --> 03:31.108
Shredder,
shut up and listen!

03:31.110 --> 03:35.880
It's April O'Neal, and we
have to develop a story plot.

03:35.882 --> 03:38.850
<i>This booster rocket</i>
<i>will launch the new</i>
<i>defense satellite</i>

03:38.852 --> 03:40.652
<i>into orbit at dawn today.</i>

03:40.654 --> 03:44.188
<i>The satellite's primary</i>
<i>feature is a super laser beam</i>

03:44.190 --> 03:46.524
<i>able to cut</i>
<i>through solid rock.</i>

03:46.526 --> 03:48.859
Or solid ice.

03:48.861 --> 03:52.030
But how can we control the ray
when it's in outer space?

03:52.032 --> 03:55.166
With this remote
control device.

03:55.168 --> 03:57.368
If we can plant it
on the satellite,

03:57.370 --> 03:58.803
I can operate
that super laser

03:58.805 --> 04:01.705
from here
in the Technodrome.

04:01.707 --> 04:03.975
There's just one
problem, Crane.

04:03.977 --> 04:05.610
The turtles.

04:05.612 --> 04:08.546
Every time we come up with a
plan to free the Technodrome,

04:08.548 --> 04:10.181
they manage to ruin it.

04:10.183 --> 04:12.050
Oh, will you relax, Shredder?

04:12.052 --> 04:14.152
This time I have a plan

04:14.154 --> 04:17.387
for dealing with those
meddlesome reptiles.

04:17.390 --> 04:18.990
Follow me.

04:23.262 --> 04:27.432
Now to open the portal
to Dimension X.

04:31.070 --> 04:32.770
Welcome, General Tragg.

04:32.772 --> 04:35.106
I have a mission for you.

04:35.108 --> 04:37.709
As you command, Lord Krang.

04:37.711 --> 04:39.711
Where is his army
of rock soldiers?

04:39.713 --> 04:42.614
He won't need them this time.
What?

04:42.616 --> 04:46.884
That boulder brain won't
stand a chance against the
turtles without his troops.

04:46.886 --> 04:49.187
This will even out the odds.

04:49.189 --> 04:51.255
What the devil is that?

04:51.257 --> 04:54.025
I call it the Rockalyzer.

04:54.027 --> 04:58.262
A ray that vitalizes
anything made of mineral.

04:58.264 --> 04:59.230
Observe.

05:07.940 --> 05:11.209
Hey, gimme that copy
of <i> Captain Cow!</i>

05:11.211 --> 05:15.547
No way.
<i>Captain Cow</i> is mine.

05:15.549 --> 05:16.548
Ow! Quit it!
Ow!

05:16.550 --> 05:18.550
I mean it!
That smarts!

05:18.552 --> 05:19.551
Hey!
Ugh!

05:19.553 --> 05:20.918
Whoa!

05:20.920 --> 05:22.887
So you can activate
a few pebbles.

05:22.889 --> 05:24.088
Big deal.

05:24.090 --> 05:25.156
Pebbles?

05:25.158 --> 05:27.792
The Rockalyzer
can move mountains!

05:27.794 --> 05:31.363
But why should Tragg get
this power instead of me?

05:31.365 --> 05:33.998
Because who better
than a rock soldier

05:34.000 --> 05:35.700
to control rocks?

05:35.702 --> 05:37.235
It's his element.

05:39.137 --> 05:41.272
But the turtles
have dishonored me!

05:41.274 --> 05:44.609
By ninja law,
they are mine to defeat.

05:44.611 --> 05:46.310
Calm down, Shredder.

05:46.312 --> 05:49.414
While General Tragg
keeps the turtles busy,

05:49.416 --> 05:51.716
you will break
into the launch pad

05:51.718 --> 05:55.086
and place the remote control
device on the satellite.

05:55.088 --> 05:59.090
Ooh! It's a much more
important task.

05:59.092 --> 06:01.493
Maybe, but beating up
the turtles

06:01.495 --> 06:03.294
is much more fun.

06:17.943 --> 06:20.078
Where are we?

06:20.080 --> 06:21.579
We'll soon find out.

06:21.581 --> 06:26.250
Uh, gee, it sure is dark
and spooky in here.

06:26.252 --> 06:28.887
Oh, who's afraid
of a little--

06:28.889 --> 06:30.221
Dinosaur!

06:30.223 --> 06:32.123
Mama!
Mama!

06:33.992 --> 06:35.626
Oh, knock it off,
you boneheads.

06:35.628 --> 06:39.530
You brought us up
in the Natural History Museum.

06:39.532 --> 06:41.132
Oh, no wonder.

06:41.134 --> 06:43.367
History always
makes me hysterical.

06:43.369 --> 06:45.669
Come on.
We've got work to do.

06:45.671 --> 06:48.272
Tragg, get busy
with that Rockalyzer.

06:54.113 --> 06:56.147
Now, my brother rocks,

06:56.149 --> 06:59.450
obey me as if you were
my soldiers.

07:03.956 --> 07:07.124
Good, but we can do better

07:07.126 --> 07:08.359
and bigger.

07:20.172 --> 07:22.273
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

07:24.176 --> 07:26.076
Oh, what a dull night.

07:26.078 --> 07:28.946
There isn't a good story
happening anywhere.

07:28.948 --> 07:30.948
Then why you do like I do?

07:32.318 --> 07:34.084
Whenever I have free time,

07:34.086 --> 07:37.121
I just practice my new
anti-stress technique.

07:37.123 --> 07:39.723
Transcendental
procrastination.

07:39.725 --> 07:42.660
Transcendental
procrastination?

07:42.662 --> 07:44.095
That's right.

07:44.097 --> 07:47.565
The art of doing absolutely
nothing whatsoever.

07:47.567 --> 07:48.800
<i>Hi.</i>

07:48.802 --> 07:51.669
<i>Welcome to Lesson 4,</i>
<i>fellow slackers.</i>

07:51.671 --> 07:55.607
<i>Now we're going to start by</i>
<i>just staring out the window,</i>

07:55.609 --> 07:56.741
<i>like so.</i>

07:56.743 --> 07:58.543
<i>Oh, very good.</i>

07:58.545 --> 08:00.378
<i>You're doing splendidly.</i>

08:00.380 --> 08:03.781
I think Vernon's finally
found something he's good at.

08:03.783 --> 08:07.452
April!  Vernon!
Quit goofing off!

08:07.454 --> 08:08.553
We just got a report

08:08.555 --> 08:12.190
that all the rocks in Central
City Park have gone whacko!

08:12.192 --> 08:14.359
Rocks? Gone whacko?

08:14.361 --> 08:17.195
Don't argue. Just get
over there right away!

08:18.430 --> 08:20.298
All right now, Raphael,

08:20.300 --> 08:21.965
We're going to see
if your strength

08:21.967 --> 08:25.803
is a match
for the power of Wu-Wee.

08:25.805 --> 08:27.938
Come on, come on, hit me
with your best shot.

08:27.940 --> 08:30.174
Heh, whatever you say.

08:30.176 --> 08:32.176
Hey! What?

08:32.178 --> 08:33.177
Oh!

08:33.179 --> 08:34.578
No fair!

08:34.581 --> 08:37.181
Since when is a sofa
a combat weapon?

08:37.183 --> 08:39.850
Hey, a good ninja can defend
himself with anything.

08:40.985 --> 08:42.720
It appears that you have
not yet mastered

08:42.722 --> 08:45.690
the concept of Wu-Wee,
Donatello.

08:45.692 --> 08:47.024
No.

08:47.026 --> 08:49.293
But I am learning a lot
about interior decorating.

08:49.295 --> 08:51.729
[beeping]

08:51.731 --> 08:53.464
<i>Hey, guys, it's me.</i>

08:53.466 --> 08:54.332
What's up, April?

08:54.334 --> 08:55.333
<i>I'm en route</i>

08:55.335 --> 08:56.434
<i>to Central City Park.</i>

08:56.436 --> 08:57.635
<i>We just got a report</i>

08:57.637 --> 08:59.470
<i>that the rocks</i>
<i>have come to life.</i>

08:59.472 --> 09:00.871
We're on our way.

09:04.042 --> 09:05.242
[April]
Rocks coming to life.

09:05.244 --> 09:06.678
Give me a break.

09:06.680 --> 09:09.414
Hmm. Things look
pretty normal to me.

09:09.416 --> 09:10.748
Huh? Uh-oh.

09:10.750 --> 09:12.750
It looks like I spoke to soon.

09:17.021 --> 09:18.856
Oh, no!

09:29.969 --> 09:32.936
Oh, I'm glad I had
those brakes checked.

09:32.938 --> 09:35.739
Easy, easy.

09:35.741 --> 09:37.508
No sudden moves.

09:37.510 --> 09:38.575
Oh, no!

09:40.145 --> 09:41.645
Aah!

09:45.117 --> 09:47.552
Okay, Donatello,
put her in reverse!

09:51.723 --> 09:53.424
Thanks for saving
my life.

09:53.426 --> 09:55.692
But do you always have
to cut it so darn close?

09:55.694 --> 09:57.495
[Donatello]
Uh, guys.

09:57.497 --> 10:00.965
Oh, no. The Channel 6 van.

10:00.967 --> 10:02.834
Forget it, April.
Let's get out of here.

10:07.406 --> 10:10.541
What the heck is making
those rocks come alive?

10:14.012 --> 10:16.914
Gee, boss,
where's everybody going?

10:16.916 --> 10:18.349
They must have gone to help

10:18.351 --> 10:20.952
with the emergency
Tragg is causing.

10:20.954 --> 10:23.921
This is going to be
a piece of cake.

10:26.424 --> 10:28.993
Ha ha! They've just
left a skeleton crew.

10:32.764 --> 10:34.565
Intruders! Stop them!

10:38.637 --> 10:40.037
Bebop! Rocksteady!

10:40.039 --> 10:41.338
Deal with those guards.

10:41.340 --> 10:43.273
I'll take the launch controls.

10:45.677 --> 10:47.779
All right, you two.
Halt!

10:47.781 --> 10:50.414
You didn't say
"Mother May I?"

10:54.085 --> 10:55.586
Oh, yeah?

10:55.588 --> 10:57.822
We can play
that game, too.

11:07.900 --> 11:12.036
That was fun.
What do we play now?

11:12.038 --> 11:14.705
Well, how about
"Tie up the guards

11:14.707 --> 11:16.874
and lock them
in the storage building"?

11:16.876 --> 11:20.310
Ooh-ooh, that is
one of my favorites!

11:20.312 --> 11:22.913
Well, Shredder,
what's going on?

11:22.915 --> 11:25.015
Everything is on schedule.

11:25.017 --> 11:26.517
<i>It had better be.</i>

11:26.519 --> 11:28.819
<i>The missile</i>
<i>is set to blast off</i>

11:28.821 --> 11:31.021
<i>in less than 20 minutes.</i>

11:31.023 --> 11:34.425
<i>That remote control</i>
<i>device must be on.</i>

11:34.427 --> 11:36.160
<i>It's the only way</i>

11:36.162 --> 11:39.363
<i>we'll cut the Technodrome</i>
<i>free from the ice.</i>

11:39.365 --> 11:40.798
We're headed there now, Krang.

11:40.800 --> 11:44.368
Meanwhile, I suggest
you...stay cool.

11:44.370 --> 11:45.569
Ha ha ha ha ha!

11:50.008 --> 11:53.077
Oh, I don't know how
many of these near
misses we can handle.

11:53.079 --> 11:55.245
Look! It's General Tragg!

11:55.247 --> 11:57.482
And that means
Shredder and Krang.

11:57.484 --> 11:59.750
So, the turtles.

11:59.752 --> 12:03.387
Prepare to be ground
into gravel.

12:03.389 --> 12:05.356
Go, Green Machine!

12:07.258 --> 12:10.461
Boy, talk about
rock hard muscles!

12:13.765 --> 12:16.868
Aw, that was my favorite bo.

12:16.870 --> 12:19.003
Whoa!

12:19.005 --> 12:22.006
This will take care of
you, boulder brain.

12:25.778 --> 12:26.611
Uh, never mind.

12:26.613 --> 12:28.746
Foolish reptiles.

12:28.748 --> 12:30.882
With the power
of the Rockalyzer,

12:30.884 --> 12:35.486
anything made of stone
will obey me.

12:35.488 --> 12:37.622
Including asphalt.

12:37.624 --> 12:41.959
[All]
Whoa!

12:41.961 --> 12:45.696
Do you get the feeling our city
streets are no longer safe?

12:45.698 --> 12:47.798
Aah!

12:47.800 --> 12:51.936
All right, I say we give this
guy some serious payback.

12:51.938 --> 12:53.437
Brother bricks,

12:53.439 --> 12:55.540
bury those turtles.

13:01.680 --> 13:03.548
Are you guys all right?

13:03.550 --> 13:05.683
Well, as all right as anyone

13:05.685 --> 13:07.551
who's just had a building
dropped on them.

13:07.553 --> 13:08.652
[cough]

13:08.654 --> 13:10.421
Okay [cough] that does it.

13:10.423 --> 13:13.657
That guy is definitely off
my Christmas card list.

13:13.659 --> 13:17.161
Uh-oh.
The story of the year,
and I'm out of tape.

13:17.163 --> 13:19.162
You guys mind if I
borrow the Turtle Van?

13:19.164 --> 13:21.164
Uh, help yourself.

13:21.166 --> 13:23.367
Looks like we'll be
stuck here a while.

13:23.369 --> 13:26.470
I'll get more tape
at Channel 6.

13:32.944 --> 13:35.212
Back for more, eh?

13:35.214 --> 13:36.346
You'll be sorry.

13:36.348 --> 13:38.816
Attention, my rock minions.

13:38.818 --> 13:41.485
It's time to join forces.

13:48.092 --> 13:50.761
I don't like the looks
of this one bit.

13:56.568 --> 13:58.703
We couldn't even dent Tragg,

13:58.705 --> 14:01.405
and this rock head
is 20 times bigger.

14:01.407 --> 14:03.907
Destroy the turtles!

14:03.909 --> 14:06.043
Destroy them!

14:06.045 --> 14:09.513
It's time to fall back
and re-plan our strategy.

14:09.515 --> 14:11.248
Quickly, my loyal soldier,

14:11.250 --> 14:14.284
you must destroy the turtles
completely.

14:14.286 --> 14:17.421
Seek them out
and finish them off.

14:18.757 --> 14:20.591
The Turtle Van!

14:20.593 --> 14:21.992
There they go now.

14:24.562 --> 14:26.630
That rock monster
is after April.

14:26.632 --> 14:28.933
I thinks we're
in the Turtle Van.

14:28.935 --> 14:30.534
It's up to us to stop it.

14:37.175 --> 14:38.475
The Turtle Van.

14:38.477 --> 14:39.744
They're in that building.

14:39.746 --> 14:42.880
Destroy it, my
loyal rock soldier.

14:42.882 --> 14:44.515
<i>[Man on TV]</i>
<i>That's it.</i>

14:44.517 --> 14:48.352
<i>Just lie there</i>
<i>and think about nothingness.</i>

14:49.521 --> 14:50.721
Vernon! Where's Vern?

14:50.723 --> 14:52.556
I've got the story
of the year!

14:52.558 --> 14:54.324
Not now, April.

14:54.326 --> 14:57.728
I'm about to reach an entirely
new level on non-involvement.

14:57.730 --> 14:58.963
Oh, yeah?

14:58.965 --> 15:00.965
Well, tell it to that thing!

15:04.669 --> 15:05.903
If anyone wants me,

15:05.905 --> 15:07.571
I'll be under my desk!

15:08.940 --> 15:10.173
Heads up, guys.

15:10.175 --> 15:12.843
That rock monster must
think we're inside.

15:12.845 --> 15:15.946
We've got to distract it
before destroys the building.

15:15.948 --> 15:18.849
Yoo-hoo!
Hey, Rocky!
Over here!

15:21.620 --> 15:22.853
It worked.

15:22.855 --> 15:23.921
Jump for it.

15:32.864 --> 15:36.433
<i>Well, Shredder,</i>
<i>what's the delay this time?</i>

15:36.435 --> 15:39.336
I'm checking on Rocksteady
and Bebop now.

15:39.338 --> 15:41.172
<i>They better not foul up.</i>

15:41.174 --> 15:43.174
<i>Time is of the essence.</i>

15:43.176 --> 15:44.842
<i>The rocket is scheduled</i>
<i>to blast off</i>

15:44.844 --> 15:48.112
<i>in less than ten minutes.</i>

15:48.114 --> 15:51.381
Enemy fighter rockets
off the port bow.

15:51.383 --> 15:52.950
Pwing! Pwing!

15:52.952 --> 15:55.920
Ooh! Ooh!
Firing phaser beams.

15:55.922 --> 15:57.487
Beep beep beep beep!

15:57.489 --> 15:59.857
Beep!  Beep!
Pwing! Pwing!

15:59.859 --> 16:03.160
What are you two
imbeciles doing?

16:03.162 --> 16:04.161
Huh? Oh.

16:04.163 --> 16:06.096
We playing space pilot.

16:06.098 --> 16:09.400
Yeah, and the
Zarkonians are winning.

16:09.402 --> 16:13.738
You haven't attached the
remote control device to
the super laser, have you?

16:13.740 --> 16:15.573
Never mind, I'll do it myself.

16:23.448 --> 16:27.050
Face it, guys, we're never
gonna whip that granite goon.

16:27.052 --> 16:28.318
Hey dudes, look!

16:30.087 --> 16:32.523
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

16:32.525 --> 16:37.160
Yeah, why should that
overgrown pet rock get
to do all the demolition?

16:43.201 --> 16:45.102
Time to wreck and roll!

16:51.209 --> 16:53.010
Timber!

17:02.320 --> 17:03.553
We did it.

17:06.089 --> 17:09.259
So, you think you've won.

17:09.261 --> 17:11.627
You haven't even come close.

17:13.396 --> 17:15.598
Why didn't I just stay
in bed this morning?

17:18.470 --> 17:21.070
Dudes, I'd say
our future's looking...

17:21.073 --> 17:22.705
kinda rocky!

17:28.112 --> 17:30.581
Turtles, there's only
one thing to do.

17:31.917 --> 17:34.118
Turtle power!

17:42.160 --> 17:45.562
Guys, I think we're
in serious trouble.

17:50.635 --> 17:51.902
[beep beep]

17:51.904 --> 17:54.304
Success, Krang. The remote
control is installed.

17:54.306 --> 17:58.142
<i>It's about time you</i>
<i>did something right.</i>

17:58.144 --> 17:59.943
Hurry, you two.

17:59.945 --> 18:02.746
That rocket will blast off
in less than two minutes.

18:05.416 --> 18:08.051
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ooh!

18:08.053 --> 18:11.621
It's no use, guys.
There's just too many of them.

18:11.623 --> 18:13.023
Maybe not.

18:13.025 --> 18:15.058
I think I see a
way to stop 'em.

18:15.060 --> 18:17.560
A rock crushing machine.

18:20.899 --> 18:22.399
But how do we get them
in there?

18:22.401 --> 18:24.634
You'll see.

18:24.636 --> 18:25.903
When I give the word,

18:25.905 --> 18:27.304
hit the power switch.

18:27.306 --> 18:29.339
Hey, you rock heads!

18:29.341 --> 18:30.640
I'm over here!

18:33.645 --> 18:35.812
That's it. Come and get me.

18:38.450 --> 18:39.383
Now, Donatello!

18:48.893 --> 18:50.394
No, my loyal followers!

18:50.396 --> 18:52.696
Stay away from that belt.

18:52.698 --> 18:54.798
Too late, pebble puss.

18:54.800 --> 18:57.734
Yeah, now you can't control
those mineral maniacs.

18:59.704 --> 19:03.140
Krang! Get me out of here!

19:03.142 --> 19:07.010
Everywhere I look,
nothing but incompetence.

19:11.983 --> 19:14.151
That's the last
of those creeps.

19:14.153 --> 19:16.619
All right, dudes,
we won!

19:16.621 --> 19:18.021
It's pizza time!

19:18.023 --> 19:20.057
Not yet, Michelangelo.

19:20.059 --> 19:21.524
You've still got another
problem to handle.

19:21.526 --> 19:23.526
Oh, yeah? Like what?

19:26.631 --> 19:28.199
Like the new defense satellite.

19:28.201 --> 19:30.667
It carries some
sort of super laser,

19:30.669 --> 19:32.602
and someone wants it
real bad.

19:32.604 --> 19:34.971
Okay, all together, gang.

19:34.973 --> 19:37.508
Who do we know
who's stuck in the Arctic

19:37.510 --> 19:40.411
and could use
an enormous laser beam

19:40.413 --> 19:42.579
to cut his Technodrome
free from the ice?

19:42.581 --> 19:44.114
[All]
Krang!

19:47.085 --> 19:49.552
Looks like they've had
an unwanted visitor.

19:53.391 --> 19:56.159
Like, where did all
the space dudes go?

19:56.161 --> 19:58.195
[muffled]
Help! We're in here!

19:59.731 --> 20:01.699
April, untie them.

20:01.701 --> 20:04.000
We've got to stop
that satellite.

20:07.705 --> 20:08.905
We're too late!

20:08.907 --> 20:10.640
The satellite is
already in orbit.

20:10.642 --> 20:14.378
Donatello,
see if you can disable
the super laser control.

20:14.380 --> 20:17.814
Uh-oh.  None of these
controls seem to be working.

20:17.816 --> 20:20.550
Then Krang's already
taken over the satellite.

20:20.552 --> 20:24.121
Maybe I can tune one of these
monitors in on the Antarctic.

20:25.890 --> 20:27.458
All systems are go.

20:27.460 --> 20:29.593
Now to fire the super laser.

20:38.202 --> 20:40.103
Start the main engines.

20:46.311 --> 20:47.911
Success!

20:47.913 --> 20:51.081
At last, the Technodrome
rolls again.

20:52.750 --> 20:55.051
[Michelangelo]
No! They're moving
the Technodrome!

20:55.053 --> 20:56.620
But how
can we stop them?

20:58.189 --> 21:00.357
We'll use Wu-Wee.

21:00.359 --> 21:03.326
Remember what
Master Splinter said.

21:03.328 --> 21:05.596
Evil always sinks
beneath its own weight.

21:11.802 --> 21:14.605
Victory is ours!

21:14.607 --> 21:16.106
Ha ha!

21:16.108 --> 21:19.042
We'll go straight to the
city and crush it flat.

21:22.447 --> 21:24.447
I finally got it!

21:24.449 --> 21:25.682
Give it back!

21:25.684 --> 21:27.718
That's my <i> Captain Cow</i> comic!

21:29.821 --> 21:31.421
Yeah, says who?

21:31.423 --> 21:32.823
It's mine now!

21:34.258 --> 21:36.259
No, mine!

21:36.261 --> 21:38.328
Whoa!
Whoa!

21:38.330 --> 21:39.596
No, you fools!

21:39.598 --> 21:41.531
Those are
the laser controls!

21:45.904 --> 21:47.904
Hey guys, look.

21:51.142 --> 21:52.875
Quick,
put on the brakes.

21:52.877 --> 21:53.777
What brakes?

21:53.779 --> 21:55.579
Then put it in reverse!

21:55.581 --> 21:56.646
Too late!

22:01.051 --> 22:03.520
Oh, no! Aaah!

22:03.522 --> 22:07.291
All right, guys!
Way to go!
Woo-hoo!

22:07.293 --> 22:10.627
It worked! Wu-Wee works!

22:10.629 --> 22:12.529
Wow, boy!

22:12.531 --> 22:14.998
Splinter said that evil
sinks under its own weight.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.199
He wasn't kidding!

22:16.201 --> 22:18.001
I don't believe it!

22:18.003 --> 22:19.803
We go from being
stuck in the ice

22:19.805 --> 22:21.905
to being stuck in the
bottom of the ocean.

22:21.907 --> 22:24.274
Well, believe it.

22:24.276 --> 22:26.910
And it's all their fault.

22:26.912 --> 22:30.914
Uh, I think we better go clean
up our room or something.

22:33.718 --> 22:35.986
So much for Shredder
and Krang's plan

22:35.988 --> 22:37.187
to conquer the world.

22:37.189 --> 22:39.322
The only thing they'll
be able to conquer now

22:39.324 --> 22:41.691
is a school of anchovies.

22:41.693 --> 22:44.228
Speaking of anchovies,

22:44.230 --> 22:46.396
how about a victory
pizza, dudes?

22:46.398 --> 22:49.032
So, Donatello,
have you at last come

22:49.034 --> 22:51.935
to understand
the principle of Wu-Wee?

22:51.937 --> 22:54.170
Uh, not entirely, Master.

22:54.172 --> 22:56.340
Yeah, but after fighting
those rock monsters,

22:56.342 --> 23:00.043
it's better than beating your
head against a stone wall.

23:01.679 --> 23:03.713
Sorry. I couldn't
help myself.
