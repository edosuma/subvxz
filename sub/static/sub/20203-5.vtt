00:06.940 --> 00:10.711
It was 1962
and America was changing.

00:12.380 --> 00:15.149
The space program was
in full swing,

00:15.149 --> 00:19.019
and John Glenn became the first
person to orbit the earth.

00:19.019 --> 00:24.092
Johnny Carson was named the new
host of The Tonight Show,

00:24.092 --> 00:27.361
and the Cuban Missile Crisis,

00:27.361 --> 00:31.065
which had kept the country
on edge for 13days,

00:31.065 --> 00:33.434
came to an end.

00:33.434 --> 00:35.703
While American culture
was shifting,

00:35.703 --> 00:40.808
the world of Playboy
had exploded.

00:40.808 --> 00:42.510
**

00:45.379 --> 00:50.618
Our magazine had over
one and a half million
readers each month.

00:50.618 --> 00:52.653
* The little girl
she looks so... *

00:52.653 --> 00:57.191
And the Playboy Club had become
the biggest party in Chicago

00:57.191 --> 00:59.827
with over 100,000 key holders.

00:59.827 --> 01:01.362
* Talk a while *

01:01.362 --> 01:03.897
* Yeah, I was looking
back to see *

01:03.897 --> 01:05.799
* If she was
looking back to see if I... *

01:05.799 --> 01:09.603
With the mounting success
of the Chicago Club,

01:09.603 --> 01:12.473
it was time to take
our party national.

01:12.473 --> 01:17.611
And I knew the perfect location
for the next Playboy Club...

01:17.611 --> 01:20.080
New York City.

01:22.483 --> 01:25.719
But the competition was tough.

01:25.719 --> 01:28.088
New York was home to the some
of the world's hottest

01:28.088 --> 01:30.124
and most iconic nightlife.

01:30.124 --> 01:33.861
So I sent Victor Lownes to get
a better feel for the market.

01:36.730 --> 01:39.800
I found a perfect location

01:39.800 --> 01:43.103
on East 59th Street.

01:43.103 --> 01:45.606
I was staying
at the Plaza Hotel,

01:45.606 --> 01:50.578
and I noticed a "for rent"
sign on a building

01:50.578 --> 01:53.714
that I could see
out of my window at the Plaza.

01:56.717 --> 01:59.019
Central Park here.

01:59.019 --> 02:01.255
Cartier,
Tiffany's.

02:01.255 --> 02:03.724
And you see these
picture windows here?

02:03.724 --> 02:05.659
That's all the advertising
we'll need.

02:05.659 --> 02:08.462
When people walk by
and see that spiral staircase

02:08.462 --> 02:11.064
filled with
a rainbow of Bunnies...

02:11.064 --> 02:12.366
We got 'em.

02:12.366 --> 02:13.767
When can renovations
begin?

02:13.767 --> 02:15.403
We should be cleared
to start in two weeks.

02:15.403 --> 02:16.737
I'm finalizing everything

02:16.737 --> 02:18.272
with the Department
of Buildings today.

02:18.272 --> 02:19.707
Which reminds me, Victor.

02:19.707 --> 02:21.809
Preliminary budgeting has us
at 2.5 million.

02:21.809 --> 02:24.212
Right now we're
overextended by a lot.

02:24.212 --> 02:25.846
We're pre-selling memberships,
that'll help.

02:25.846 --> 02:27.815
No, it will help,
you're right, but--

02:27.815 --> 02:29.517
Bob, it's New York.

02:29.517 --> 02:33.654
I know it's New York, but it
doesn't hurt to limit risk.

02:33.654 --> 02:36.156
This is what I want.

02:36.156 --> 02:39.059
This design,
at this address.

02:39.059 --> 02:40.728
To me,
that's worth the risk.

02:43.331 --> 02:47.368
They put $7 million
into renovations,

02:47.368 --> 02:49.870
and that was a huge amount
at that time.

02:49.870 --> 02:53.941
And that did not even take into
account the advertising budget.

02:53.941 --> 02:57.445
So Victor really had
high hopes for this Club

02:57.445 --> 03:01.315
being really the jewel
in the Playboy Club chain.

03:02.983 --> 03:05.152
With our plans in place,

03:05.152 --> 03:07.755
we started construction.

03:13.160 --> 03:16.697
And at seven stories high,
the Club would have twice

03:16.697 --> 03:18.932
the capacity
of our Chicago location.

03:22.102 --> 03:25.706
But I soon realized that
doing business in New York

03:25.706 --> 03:27.875
had risks I hadn't anticipated.

03:30.010 --> 03:33.514
To open a club, you needed
a liquor license.

03:33.514 --> 03:35.182
And to get a liquor license,

03:35.182 --> 03:38.452
you had to go through
the state's licensing board.

03:38.452 --> 03:43.324
But no state government was
more corrupt than New York's.

03:46.427 --> 03:50.197
Albany was since
the 19th century

03:50.197 --> 03:53.000
and continuesto this day,
a cesspool of corruption.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.403
If you want to get anything
done in New York State,

03:55.403 --> 03:57.705
you gotta pay somebody.

03:57.705 --> 04:00.541
You've got to pay
some elected official, right,

04:00.541 --> 04:03.043
to get the go-ahead.

04:03.043 --> 04:05.479
That is how things
are done in New York.

04:06.880 --> 04:09.450
Soon enough, we were informed

04:09.450 --> 04:11.652
that in order to open our Club,

04:11.652 --> 04:14.054
we had to pay a corrupt
government official

04:14.054 --> 04:16.624
a bribe of $100,000.

04:20.661 --> 04:22.563
This is blackmail.

04:22.563 --> 04:24.465
That's how it works.

04:28.736 --> 04:30.003
Well, we're not paying him.

04:30.003 --> 04:31.572
We need to open the Club now

04:31.572 --> 04:33.106
and we can't do that
without a liquor license.

04:33.106 --> 04:35.876
Plus, we've already started
selling memberships.

04:35.876 --> 04:38.846
We have over 10,000
customers who already paid.

04:38.846 --> 04:41.048
How would they react if we
canceled the opening?

04:41.048 --> 04:45.052
Arnie insisted that pay-offs
were the cost of doing business.

04:45.052 --> 04:48.456
But paying a bribe went against
everything I stood for.

05:01.735 --> 05:04.438
Hefner's an extremely
moral person.

05:04.438 --> 05:08.041
You had to be, and there were
so many trumped-up charges,

05:08.041 --> 05:12.513
and efforts to indict us for
things that we didn't do wrong

05:12.513 --> 05:15.449
that we had to keep
our nose clean.

05:17.918 --> 05:19.820
I knew it was a risk

05:19.820 --> 05:24.057
to involve Playboy
in any illegal activity.

05:24.057 --> 05:28.261
But if we wanted to get
our liquor license
to open our club,

05:28.261 --> 05:30.998
I had no choice.

05:30.998 --> 05:32.600
So I paid the bribe.

05:42.943 --> 05:45.312
What I didn't know then
was that

05:45.312 --> 05:47.280
in going against my conscience,

05:47.280 --> 05:50.684
I was making a decision
that would haunt Playboy

05:50.684 --> 05:52.620
for years to come.

05:54.955 --> 05:58.992
* Every little movement *

05:58.992 --> 06:03.363
* Every little thing you do *

06:03.363 --> 06:05.866
* Is it sleight of hand *

06:05.866 --> 06:10.938
* That commands
my heart to love you?

06:10.938 --> 06:14.942
* Every little movement *

06:14.942 --> 06:18.145
* Every little movement **

06:22.115 --> 06:25.185
**

06:25.185 --> 06:28.522
On December 8, 1962,

06:28.522 --> 06:30.891
after a rocky start,

06:30.891 --> 06:34.762
our biggest venture yet,
the Playboy Club New York

06:34.762 --> 06:36.664
finally opened its doors.

06:36.664 --> 06:39.232
* Don't cry no more *

06:39.232 --> 06:42.002
* Wipe away your tears *

06:42.002 --> 06:44.438
* Don't cry no more baby *

06:44.438 --> 06:46.406
* Wipe away your tears *

06:46.406 --> 06:49.910
With its spiral staircase,
elevated piano bar,

06:49.910 --> 06:52.245
and 360-degree fireplace,

06:52.245 --> 06:55.883
it was even more stunning
than our Chicago operation.

06:55.883 --> 06:58.118
**

07:00.588 --> 07:04.124
We had comedians and singers.

07:04.124 --> 07:06.760
A cue around the block.

07:06.760 --> 07:09.563
It was a huge success
right from the start.

07:09.563 --> 07:12.332
* You cried me a river *

07:12.332 --> 07:15.903
* You cried me a sea *

07:15.903 --> 07:18.138
* And I believed
without a doubt *

07:18.138 --> 07:20.440
* That you really really
really loved me *

07:20.440 --> 07:23.176
* Don't cry no more *

07:23.176 --> 07:24.945
**

07:29.750 --> 07:32.720
And I had the most beautiful
date in the room.

07:35.222 --> 07:38.559
My girlfriend, Cynthia Maddox.

07:38.559 --> 07:41.695
Cynthia wasn't
the only woman I dated,

07:41.695 --> 07:45.132
But anytime I was at the Club,
she was at my side.

07:47.100 --> 07:51.805
Within weeks, we were averaging
over 3,000 guests a night.

07:53.574 --> 07:54.775
Not bad, huh?

07:56.510 --> 07:58.078
Not bad at all.

07:58.078 --> 08:00.981
* You cried me a river *

08:00.981 --> 08:02.650
* You cried me
a sea... *

08:02.650 --> 08:06.654
And I knew if we could conquer
the New York nightclub scene,

08:06.654 --> 08:09.022
we could succeed anywhere.

08:10.791 --> 08:12.926
Within a year,
we had Playboy Clubs

08:12.926 --> 08:18.265
in Miami, New Orleans,
St. Louis, Phoenix, Detroit,

08:18.265 --> 08:23.070
Baltimore, Kansas City,
Cincinnati and Los Angeles.

08:27.307 --> 08:30.343
Playboy was on top of the world.

08:30.343 --> 08:33.080
But just when it seemed like
everything was going our way...

08:33.080 --> 08:34.848
* Don't cry no more baby... *

08:34.848 --> 08:38.118
...a decision I made
months earlier

08:38.118 --> 08:41.521
was about to threaten
the entire Playboy empire.

09:01.909 --> 09:05.178
Hef?

09:05.178 --> 09:06.346
Hef...

09:06.346 --> 09:07.748
Bob?

09:07.748 --> 09:09.216
Sorry, I know it's early.

09:09.216 --> 09:10.450
It's 10:00 a.m.

09:10.450 --> 09:11.518
It's important.

09:13.553 --> 09:17.625
Just a few months after
the New York Club opened,

09:17.625 --> 09:20.928
my staff caught wind
of a government operation

09:20.928 --> 09:22.763
that could shut us down.

09:27.901 --> 09:30.470
New York Governor,
Nelson Rockefeller,

09:30.470 --> 09:33.140
had announced a corruption
investigation

09:33.140 --> 09:37.377
with a specific focus
on the State Liquor Authority,

09:37.377 --> 09:40.580
the same organization that had
forced me to pay a bribe

09:40.580 --> 09:43.083
to get my club open.

09:43.083 --> 09:45.218
I knew it was only
a matter of time

09:45.218 --> 09:47.955
before Rockefeller's
investigation

09:47.955 --> 09:50.123
would lead directly to Playboy.

09:51.759 --> 09:54.662
Hefner had apparently
given a bribe

09:54.662 --> 09:56.463
to two New York
state officials,

09:56.463 --> 09:58.799
the Chairman of the Republican
Party of New York

09:58.799 --> 10:02.535
and the Chairman
of the State Liquor Board.

10:02.535 --> 10:04.537
In Hugh Hefner's mind,

10:04.537 --> 10:06.273
he had done what he needed to,

10:06.273 --> 10:08.876
to get Playboy's liquor
license in New York

10:11.378 --> 10:17.350
Practically every club owner in
New York City had paid a bribe.

10:17.350 --> 10:20.287
But I knew our success
made us a big target.

10:23.390 --> 10:28.595
And if investigators found out,
the Club could be shut down.

10:28.595 --> 10:31.832
The Playboy name could be
tarnished,

10:31.832 --> 10:34.201
and we could face
criminal charges.

10:37.738 --> 10:41.274
To save Playboy's reputation
and my own,

10:41.274 --> 10:44.745
I decided there was
only one thing to do.

10:52.619 --> 10:57.858
Once one succumbs
to a bribe transaction,

10:57.858 --> 11:01.194
you are hooked... forever.

11:01.194 --> 11:03.596
Anything you need, names, dates,
Playboy will give it to you.

11:03.596 --> 11:07.701
We went to the District
Attorney's office in New York,

11:07.701 --> 11:11.171
and we told them
what had occurred.

11:11.171 --> 11:14.341
And they said they would work
together on this.

11:14.341 --> 11:17.778
First time, I think that
it ever happened in New York.

11:19.646 --> 11:21.181
Hefner and Morton,

11:21.181 --> 11:24.184
the way they felt about it
had a certain rationale.

11:24.184 --> 11:25.753
And with all the evidence...

11:25.753 --> 11:29.289
We even paid
the bribe with a check.

11:29.289 --> 11:32.492
And, I mean, so there was
no question about evidence.

11:32.492 --> 11:35.695
And there was no question
about blowing the whistle.

11:37.831 --> 11:39.833
I followed through
with my promise

11:39.833 --> 11:41.769
and turned over
all of our books.

11:44.304 --> 11:49.109
By handling it the way
we handled the approach

11:49.109 --> 11:50.710
works out in the end.

11:50.710 --> 11:55.715
And the word gets out to these
people that you cannot touch us

11:55.715 --> 11:59.787
with these unlawful suggestions.

11:59.787 --> 12:03.390
**

12:03.390 --> 12:06.960
* Go away baby quit hanging
around my bed... *

12:06.960 --> 12:11.698
After months of investigation
and a high-profile trial,

12:11.698 --> 12:16.169
Judson Morhouse,
the man who had forced us
to pay the bribe,

12:16.169 --> 12:19.372
was removed from office,
disbarred, and convicted

12:19.372 --> 12:22.575
on charges of both corruption
and extortion.

12:22.575 --> 12:25.245
**

12:25.245 --> 12:27.114
* Your love has ruined my... *

12:27.114 --> 12:30.517
Our testimony proved so vital
to the state's case,

12:30.517 --> 12:34.421
Playboy was forgiven
on all counts.

12:34.421 --> 12:36.890
Hefner had, in fact, come clean.

12:36.890 --> 12:38.859
And then he did
whatever he could

12:38.859 --> 12:41.061
to break the whole
scheme of corruption

12:41.061 --> 12:43.330
by providing testimony

12:43.330 --> 12:45.833
against these two guys
who were convicted.

12:45.833 --> 12:47.935
**

12:47.935 --> 12:50.570
While I was dealing
with the Clubs,

12:50.570 --> 12:54.174
the world was changing.

12:54.174 --> 12:56.643
* You gotta leave me baby... *

12:56.643 --> 13:00.147
And I quickly realized Playboy
needed to change with it.

13:04.117 --> 13:06.353
The pill came in in 1960.

13:06.353 --> 13:08.856
And there were
topless go-go dancers

13:08.856 --> 13:11.491
in both New York
and, uh, San Francisco.

13:11.491 --> 13:15.028
And the sexual revolution had
become a reality.

13:15.028 --> 13:17.330
And with that a permissiveness

13:17.330 --> 13:20.267
that offered a new possibility
in terms of freedom.

13:22.102 --> 13:23.971
It was also a time
of revolution too,

13:23.971 --> 13:25.138
and you can't separate
that either.

13:26.940 --> 13:28.808
I have a dream...

13:28.808 --> 13:31.544
It was a time of questioning
old mores and values.

13:31.544 --> 13:34.982
It was a reaction
to the very repressive values

13:34.982 --> 13:37.117
that had existed
in the '40s and '50s.

13:37.117 --> 13:40.720
It was questioning a lot
of the fundamental views

13:40.720 --> 13:42.589
that people saw were hurtful.

13:42.589 --> 13:46.059
We hold these truths
to be self-evident

13:46.059 --> 13:48.996
that all men are created equal.

13:48.996 --> 13:51.498
At City Hall Park
another multitude

13:51.498 --> 13:54.401
welcomes the young democratic
Bay Stater.

13:54.401 --> 13:56.269
With John F. Kennedy

13:56.269 --> 13:57.938
pushing a progressive agenda
in the White House,

13:57.938 --> 14:02.675
it seemed like America was
on the cusp of a new era.

14:02.675 --> 14:05.245
And I knew then
that Playboy needed to be

14:05.245 --> 14:06.947
at the forefront
of the revolution.

14:06.947 --> 14:09.917
* Quit hanging 'round my bed **

14:13.786 --> 14:17.390
**

14:20.894 --> 14:24.131
* Every day
in the same old way *

14:24.131 --> 14:25.933
* I'm a 9:00 to 5:00... *

14:25.933 --> 14:29.937
We began publishing articles
tackling the changing times.

14:29.937 --> 14:33.306
We slammed nuclear testing,

14:33.306 --> 14:36.743
criticized America's corrupt
auto industry,

14:36.743 --> 14:40.380
and basted America's
outdated government leaders.

14:42.682 --> 14:46.686
We were even covering social
issues like economic reform.

14:46.686 --> 14:50.223
Even some of my early critics
had to admit

14:50.223 --> 14:52.892
the magazine
was doing important work.

14:55.628 --> 14:58.966
The come-on for Playboy
in the '60s

14:58.966 --> 15:00.667
was the fact
that you were going to see

15:00.667 --> 15:02.335
the Playmate of the Month.

15:02.335 --> 15:05.405
Once you bought the magazine
and began to read it,

15:05.405 --> 15:10.310
then you understood that there
was stuff worth looking at.

15:10.310 --> 15:12.479
Worth reading,
worth thinking about.

15:12.479 --> 15:16.016
And some of it
was indeed groundbreaking.

15:16.016 --> 15:17.584
**

15:17.584 --> 15:19.586
Playboy in its tenth year

15:19.586 --> 15:22.990
was becoming more influential
than ever before.

15:22.990 --> 15:25.025
**

15:25.025 --> 15:28.728
Writers, cartoonists,
photographers, artists,

15:28.728 --> 15:34.001
they all wanted to be part
of this cultural revolutionary

15:34.001 --> 15:36.136
piece of work
that we were doing.

15:36.136 --> 15:39.639
And some of them,
and many of them actually

15:39.639 --> 15:42.642
worked for less
than their normal fees

15:42.642 --> 15:43.910
just to be part of it.

15:43.910 --> 15:46.213
* So much to live... *

15:46.213 --> 15:48.748
Because I was
the face of the company,

15:48.748 --> 15:51.051
I wanted to start my own column

15:51.051 --> 15:53.686
to address topics
I cared about.

15:53.686 --> 15:58.758
From drug law reform to
separation of church and state.

15:58.758 --> 16:01.628
I called it
The Playboy Philosophy.

16:01.628 --> 16:05.598
**

16:05.598 --> 16:08.968
But our biggest addition was
inspired by the conversations

16:08.968 --> 16:11.804
I was having with celebrities
and intellectuals

16:11.804 --> 16:14.674
at my parties
and on my TV show.

16:14.674 --> 16:16.843
I thought it would be great
to give them a platform

16:16.843 --> 16:19.079
to talk about the issues
they cared about,

16:19.079 --> 16:21.714
and I knew our readers
would love it.

16:27.787 --> 16:31.191
We called it
The Playboy Interview.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.494
The first Playboy Interview

16:34.494 --> 16:36.463
was with my good friend,
Miles Davis.

16:38.298 --> 16:42.435
In an interview that took place
over two days,

16:42.435 --> 16:45.138
he went beyond talking
about music

16:45.138 --> 16:47.440
and opened up
about his experience

16:47.440 --> 16:49.542
as a black man in America.

16:51.411 --> 16:55.315
The magazine wanted to prove
itself to be broad-minded.

16:55.315 --> 16:58.651
Miles Davis was
this very important guy.

16:58.651 --> 17:05.024
The interview was comprehensive,
patient, finely edited.

17:07.727 --> 17:09.629
Over the next few months,

17:09.629 --> 17:11.864
we interviewed Peter Sellers,

17:11.864 --> 17:13.933
Jackie Gleason,

17:13.933 --> 17:15.602
and Ayn Rand.

17:18.171 --> 17:19.872
The interviews themselves
could have

17:19.872 --> 17:22.409
up to 40 hours of material,

17:22.409 --> 17:25.912
compiled over weeks or months.

17:25.912 --> 17:28.248
Well, the thing that makes
the Playboy Interview

17:28.248 --> 17:31.851
completely unique is,
it's incredibly in-depth.

17:31.851 --> 17:34.854
I mean, who's gonna give,
you know, somewhere between

17:34.854 --> 17:38.658
ten and 25 hours
to an interviewer, you know?

17:38.658 --> 17:41.861
I mean, especially now,
when every celebrity

17:41.861 --> 17:44.364
is so completely controlled
by publicists.

17:44.364 --> 17:47.867
By spending so much time
with celebrities,

17:47.867 --> 17:50.237
we developed a rapport.

17:50.237 --> 17:52.205
And they shared things with us

17:52.205 --> 17:55.108
they would never tell
any other publication.

17:55.108 --> 17:58.378
It was a big status thing
to do the Playboy Interview.

17:58.378 --> 18:01.448
And I think I answered
some things perhaps

18:01.448 --> 18:04.584
a little more frankly
than I normally would,

18:04.584 --> 18:08.087
thinking I'm in the big time
of Playboy now.

18:11.524 --> 18:13.960
The Playboy Interview went on
to become

18:13.960 --> 18:18.265
one of the most iconic features
in the magazine's history.

18:18.265 --> 18:20.600
The interview was
in the first 20 years,

18:20.600 --> 18:24.671
you'll see that they are
like a classical symphony.

18:24.671 --> 18:28.475
One melody leads into the next
melody and the third melody

18:28.475 --> 18:30.510
is a counterpoint
on the first melody.

18:32.579 --> 18:36.216
There is a comprehensiveness
to them.

18:36.216 --> 18:39.619
Many years later,
Steve Jobs said about

18:39.619 --> 18:41.654
his first Playboy Interview,

18:41.654 --> 18:45.325
it was the single best thing
in media he had ever done.

18:52.799 --> 18:55.402
With all of our new
editorial features,

18:55.402 --> 18:57.504
there was so much to do
at the magazine

18:57.504 --> 19:00.640
that I had little time
for anything else,

19:00.640 --> 19:03.109
including my girlfriend,
Cynthia.

19:03.109 --> 19:05.144
I'm bored.

19:05.144 --> 19:07.280
I've gotta get this
done by tonight.

19:07.280 --> 19:12.352
* But I'm feeling so sad *

19:14.987 --> 19:19.259
* I long to try *

19:19.259 --> 19:24.531
* Something I've never had *

19:24.531 --> 19:29.602
* Never had no kissin' *

19:29.602 --> 19:31.871
* Oh what I've been missin' *

19:31.871 --> 19:33.973
I've, uh... I've gotta
get this done by tonight.

19:33.973 --> 19:40.179
* Lover man
oh where can you be? *

19:44.584 --> 19:45.985
* The night is so cold *

19:45.985 --> 19:46.919
Cynthia...

19:49.356 --> 19:52.292
* And I'm so alone *

19:55.695 --> 19:57.964
* I'd give my soul *

19:59.866 --> 20:03.370
* Just to call you my own *

20:05.405 --> 20:08.741
* Got a moon above me *

20:10.710 --> 20:16.416
* But no one to love me
lover man... *

20:16.416 --> 20:18.418
You're really not
making this easy for me.

20:18.418 --> 20:20.620
But I have to work, okay?

20:24.557 --> 20:28.328
* I've heard it said *

20:28.328 --> 20:34.233
* That the thrill of romance *

20:34.233 --> 20:35.902
* Can be... **

20:51.818 --> 20:54.020
I knew I should have
been spending

20:54.020 --> 20:56.055
more time with Cynthia,

20:56.055 --> 20:57.724
but my devotion to the magazine

20:57.724 --> 21:01.561
was far from the only problem
in our relationship.

21:01.561 --> 21:04.597
He dates other girls,
and I don't like it.

21:05.732 --> 21:07.400
He knows I don't like it.

21:07.400 --> 21:09.268
And he doesn't like when I date,

21:09.268 --> 21:11.070
and he feels
it's wrong when I date.

21:11.070 --> 21:14.807
Discussions go back and forth
and we try to work things out,

21:14.807 --> 21:19.579
but I don't know what's going
to happen if this continues on.

21:24.016 --> 21:25.485
I'll be right back.

21:29.422 --> 21:33.626
Cynthia was a very
vibrant young woman.

21:33.626 --> 21:35.728
And they had a romantic
relationship.

21:35.728 --> 21:41.000
Hefner never indicated
that he was a one-woman man.

21:41.000 --> 21:45.605
And that was not to Cynthia's
liking, as one can imagine.

21:45.605 --> 21:49.175
* Was it done just for fun? *

21:49.175 --> 21:52.178
* We have necked
till I'm wrecked... *

21:52.178 --> 21:55.915
Throughout all the years
with Playboy,

21:55.915 --> 22:00.853
I never had
a monogamous relationship.

22:00.853 --> 22:04.457
I think I was committed
to that lifestyle.

22:04.457 --> 22:08.060
It was a young man's fantasy.

22:08.060 --> 22:11.364
I was in a unique position
as the publisher of Playboy.

22:11.364 --> 22:14.333
Mm-hmm.

22:14.333 --> 22:16.736
Well, let's set it up.

22:16.736 --> 22:17.937
Or try to.

22:21.273 --> 22:23.676
I'll, I'll call
you back, Spec, okay.

22:27.146 --> 22:28.948
Everything okay?

22:28.948 --> 22:30.750
It's great.

22:30.750 --> 22:35.054
These heels, though...
they're a killer.

22:35.054 --> 22:37.156
I'm sure if you talk
to the Bunny Mother,

22:37.156 --> 22:40.359
she'll let you go back
to the dressing room
and take five.

22:40.359 --> 22:43.062
Oh, I don't know,
she seems pretty strict.

22:43.062 --> 22:45.998
Plus... it's always
fun to break the rules

22:45.998 --> 22:48.067
every once in a while,
isn't it?

22:57.343 --> 22:59.846
Cynthia Maddox was
really beautiful.

22:59.846 --> 23:03.215
Hef, uh, fell in love with her.

23:03.215 --> 23:05.685
They started dating.

23:05.685 --> 23:09.889
But Cynthia wanted to have
a relationship with him.

23:09.889 --> 23:13.460
She just didn't wanna be
another girl,

23:13.460 --> 23:15.762
and Hef wasn't prepared
for that.

23:19.832 --> 23:22.368
In the spring of 1963,

23:22.368 --> 23:25.972
my relationship with Cynthia
came to an end.

23:25.972 --> 23:28.340
Part of what my pursuit
of happiness has been all about

23:28.340 --> 23:31.878
has been an attempt to walk
a different road.

23:31.878 --> 23:35.414
And when you're walking
a different road without a map,

23:35.414 --> 23:38.417
uh, you're gonna make mistakes.

23:38.417 --> 23:41.788
And, you know, when you're
involved in a, in a series

23:41.788 --> 23:43.556
of romantic relationships,

23:43.556 --> 23:45.992
the nature of that
is gonna hurt.

23:48.495 --> 23:50.763
I was sad to see Cynthia go,

23:50.763 --> 23:53.866
but work was a welcome
distraction.

23:53.866 --> 23:56.235
And soon,
bigger issues of the day

23:56.235 --> 23:58.404
were taking up
all of my attention.

24:03.810 --> 24:07.580
The Negro still is not free.

24:09.482 --> 24:12.284
The Civil Rights Movement
was gaining momentum,

24:12.284 --> 24:14.954
but the peaceful demonstrations
advocated

24:14.954 --> 24:21.160
by Martin Luther King Jr.,
soon gave way to violence...

24:25.197 --> 24:28.167
...as police
in Birmingham, Alabama

24:28.167 --> 24:30.503
brutally assaulted black
protestors.

24:32.672 --> 24:34.440
We can never be satisfied

24:34.440 --> 24:36.643
as long as the Negro is
the victim

24:36.643 --> 24:40.346
of the unspeakable horrors
of police brutality.

24:46.285 --> 24:49.656
Playboy had been involved in
Civil Rights issues for years,

24:49.656 --> 24:52.759
and we weren't going
to stop now.

24:57.864 --> 25:01.333
We did everything there was
to do about Civil Rights.

25:01.333 --> 25:06.539
It was an overwhelming fact that
black people were badly treated

25:06.539 --> 25:08.107
and that the magazine should do

25:08.107 --> 25:10.476
what it could
to make that better.

25:10.476 --> 25:14.280
The thing about the magazine
that nobody realizes

25:14.280 --> 25:18.084
is it was the only magazine
in America that was fearless

25:18.084 --> 25:21.287
on any topic you gave it,
Playboy could cover it

25:21.287 --> 25:24.056
and could cover it honestly.

25:24.056 --> 25:28.628
In early 1963, a new leader
in the Civil Rights Movement

25:28.628 --> 25:30.529
had captured
the nation's attention.

25:35.167 --> 25:39.872
Malcolm X was
a polarizing figure,

25:39.872 --> 25:41.741
who, unlike Dr. King,

25:41.741 --> 25:44.243
encouraged violence
as a means of protest.

25:44.243 --> 25:47.880
We need an organization
that no one downtown loves.

25:47.880 --> 25:51.651
We need one that's ready
and willing to take action,

25:51.651 --> 25:53.419
any kind of action...

25:53.419 --> 25:56.823
Not when the man downtown sees
fit but when we see fit.

25:56.823 --> 26:01.127
By any means necessary.

26:01.127 --> 26:03.696
Malcolm X
was a black nationalist

26:03.696 --> 26:05.197
who thought white people
were barbaric

26:05.197 --> 26:08.901
by not allowing us
to use public facilities.

26:08.901 --> 26:12.371
In that season of fear
and polarization

26:12.371 --> 26:15.942
driven by former slaveholders
and segregationists,

26:15.942 --> 26:18.110
the argument was that Malcolm
did not deserve a platform.

26:19.946 --> 26:22.014
In the spring of 1963,

26:22.014 --> 26:24.784
Malcolm X agreed
to sit down with us.

26:29.155 --> 26:32.124
We can't publish this.

26:32.124 --> 26:35.094
"The white man must realize
that the sins of the fathers

26:35.094 --> 26:37.930
"are about to be visited upon
the heads of the children

26:37.930 --> 26:39.832
"who have continued
those sins,

26:39.832 --> 26:42.001
only in more
sophisticated ways."

26:42.001 --> 26:44.036
This is practically
a declaration of war.

26:44.036 --> 26:46.072
If I'm not mistaken, it's what
he's been saying for years.

26:46.072 --> 26:48.775
It is not our place to get
involved in his crusade.

26:48.775 --> 26:51.277
Why not?
Because we're white?

26:51.277 --> 26:54.046
Because we don't like
what he's saying?

26:54.046 --> 26:57.416
Look, we've fought for years
against censorship of all kind,

26:57.416 --> 27:00.119
to be able to express ourselves
the way we see fit,

27:00.119 --> 27:02.955
live our life
how we want to.

27:02.955 --> 27:06.525
Let's not become
hypocrites here, Spec.

27:06.525 --> 27:08.194
Print this as is.

27:11.430 --> 27:17.136
Malcolm X, his message
was really important.

27:17.136 --> 27:21.407
But his rhetoric and language
was definitely threatening,

27:21.407 --> 27:25.144
even to those who had
embraced civil rights.

27:25.144 --> 27:27.479
Black people, you cannot
trust the white devil.

27:27.479 --> 27:31.851
The white devil will always try
to keep you in chains.

27:31.851 --> 27:35.387
So the fact that
you would have Hugh Hefner

27:35.387 --> 27:39.125
giving Malcolm X an interview
in Playboy magazine,

27:39.125 --> 27:41.493
whoa, man, now that's wild.

27:41.493 --> 27:43.262
And they were interested...

27:43.262 --> 27:45.364
Hefner stood almost alone

27:45.364 --> 27:49.201
in the social, political role,
as a force to be dealt with.

27:49.201 --> 27:50.903
It was courageous 'cause
he was being encouraged

27:50.903 --> 27:54.106
to not publish
the Malcolm X interview.

27:54.106 --> 27:56.375
But he did not surrender.

27:59.178 --> 28:01.047
We knew that publishing
the interview

28:01.047 --> 28:03.182
could mean losing subscribers,

28:03.182 --> 28:05.718
but I was willing to bet
America was ready

28:05.718 --> 28:08.721
to hear his words.

28:08.721 --> 28:11.290
As it turns out, I was right.

28:12.992 --> 28:15.327
After the Malcolm X
interview ran,

28:15.327 --> 28:17.897
letters poured in
from all over the country,

28:17.897 --> 28:19.866
thanking us for covering
his movement.

28:23.335 --> 28:27.073
After nearly a decade,
Playboy magazine was finally

28:27.073 --> 28:30.376
being recognized as much
for its editorial content

28:30.376 --> 28:32.144
as for its centerfolds.

28:34.313 --> 28:36.883
But that was
all about to change.

28:48.594 --> 28:50.696
- Hef?!
- Bobbie!

28:50.696 --> 28:52.431
- Hef!
- What is it?

28:52.431 --> 28:53.833
The cops are downstairs.

28:53.833 --> 28:56.903
Just tell them
I'll deal with it tomorrow.

28:56.903 --> 28:58.204
They're here for you.

29:13.752 --> 29:16.055
On June 4, 1963,

29:16.055 --> 29:18.390
I was arrested and charged

29:18.390 --> 29:22.161
with creating and distributing
an obscene publication.

29:24.230 --> 29:27.133
Newspapers quickly
picked up the story,

29:27.133 --> 29:29.535
and I couldn't help wonder
why the city of Chicago

29:29.535 --> 29:31.838
was coming after me now.

29:33.205 --> 29:35.207
We knew the magazine
wasn't obscene

29:35.207 --> 29:37.476
because I knew my plans
for the magazine,

29:37.476 --> 29:39.545
I knew that the Supreme Court
had already established

29:39.545 --> 29:40.947
that nudity was not obscene.

29:42.048 --> 29:43.349
The difference with Playboy

29:43.349 --> 29:45.985
is that we went mainstream
immediately.

29:50.556 --> 29:55.361
The obscene publication
in question was our June issue,

29:55.361 --> 29:57.696
specifically,
an eight-page spread

29:57.696 --> 30:00.466
of actress Jayne Mansfield.

30:00.466 --> 30:03.002
Playboy had published
nude photos

30:03.002 --> 30:05.838
of Mansfield twice before,

30:05.838 --> 30:09.541
but our new photos were unique.

30:09.541 --> 30:14.146
Taken on the set
of her upcoming film,
Promises! Promises!,

30:14.146 --> 30:16.682
it was the first mainstream
Hollywood movie

30:16.682 --> 30:19.518
to feature a star in the nude.

30:19.518 --> 30:23.322
The standards of obscenity were
very vague in these years.

30:23.322 --> 30:26.192
Prosecutors claimed
that those pictures

30:26.192 --> 30:28.427
were particularly obscene

30:28.427 --> 30:31.563
because there was
a full-dressed man,

30:31.563 --> 30:35.334
another character from the film
sitting on the side of the bed,

30:35.334 --> 30:39.205
and they claimed that
the captions were obscene.

30:39.205 --> 30:41.207
They talked about
Jayne Mansfield

30:41.207 --> 30:43.575
writhing around in the bed.

30:51.183 --> 30:54.786
After spending the night
in a Chicago jail cell,

30:54.786 --> 30:58.357
I was released on bail
and returned home to start

30:58.357 --> 31:02.128
working on how to fight
these ridiculous charges.

31:03.829 --> 31:07.533
There aren't a whole lot
of things in our society,

31:07.533 --> 31:09.435
not many publications,

31:09.435 --> 31:13.372
that are willing to stand up
and say sex is good.

31:13.372 --> 31:16.408
I'm the guy
and Playboy's the magazine

31:16.408 --> 31:20.379
that is willing to say
sex is a good thing.

31:20.379 --> 31:23.215
Sexual imagery
is a good thing.

31:23.215 --> 31:26.218
The act itself is a good thing.

31:26.218 --> 31:28.988
And before you can tell me
that it hurts somebody,

31:28.988 --> 31:31.924
you have to make a serious case.

31:33.659 --> 31:36.495
What makes something obscene?

31:36.495 --> 31:39.398
The Supreme Court still
hasn't come up with

31:39.398 --> 31:42.034
a legit definition,
a specific definition.

31:42.034 --> 31:46.272
It's intentionally
written in a vague way.

31:46.272 --> 31:51.243
So, if you were to try to
publish a national magazine,

31:51.243 --> 31:55.114
you are open, uh, to prosecution
left and right.

32:00.919 --> 32:04.156
We need to avoid
court at all costs.

32:04.156 --> 32:06.959
I just don't think
we have a choice here.

32:06.959 --> 32:08.760
And we have the money
to settle.

32:08.760 --> 32:10.229
You think the city
of Chicago's gonna let us

32:10.229 --> 32:11.530
settle out of court?

32:11.530 --> 32:13.099
You know what? We gotta try.

32:13.099 --> 32:15.001
- I agree with that.
- We can afford it.

32:15.001 --> 32:17.203
We need to be prepared for both
eventualities, frankly.

32:22.708 --> 32:24.610
Hugh Hefner was facing

32:24.610 --> 32:27.646
a criminal sentence,
a prison term.

32:27.646 --> 32:31.650
How many people are willing
to risk criminal prosecution?

32:31.650 --> 32:34.420
Even if you're ultimately
acquitted,

32:34.420 --> 32:39.458
you have enormous expenses,
enormous amount of time drained,

32:39.458 --> 32:43.462
and a big stigma, being accused
of engaging in obscenity.

32:43.462 --> 32:49.268
So you have to be willing
to place your resources

32:49.268 --> 32:51.737
and your reputation on the line.

32:54.106 --> 32:56.108
Despite my team's advice,

32:56.108 --> 32:59.278
I knew settling
wasn't an option.

32:59.278 --> 33:03.082
These charges were censorship,
plain and simple,

33:03.082 --> 33:06.652
and no one was going to take
away my freedom of speech.

33:10.756 --> 33:13.259
I don't take on cases
that are easy.

33:13.259 --> 33:15.127
And I don't take on cases
I don't believe in.

33:15.127 --> 33:17.363
So you're saying
this case won't be easy?

33:20.366 --> 33:23.202
Six years ago,
the Supreme Court ruled

33:23.202 --> 33:26.038
that it's not enough to point
to a single article

33:26.038 --> 33:28.440
or image to label
a publication as obscene.

33:28.440 --> 33:31.110
You have to look
at the magazine as a whole.

33:31.110 --> 33:34.646
Well, there you go,
Playboy's primarily focused
on lifestyle, not nudity.

33:34.646 --> 33:36.048
Correct.

33:36.048 --> 33:39.385
So... what's the catch?

33:39.385 --> 33:42.354
Well, when we go to court,
no matter how clearly

33:42.354 --> 33:45.424
we explain it, we'll be
at the mercy of a jury.

33:45.424 --> 33:48.627
The man I had chosen
to represent mehad already

33:48.627 --> 33:51.997
won some of America's most
controversial cases.

33:51.997 --> 33:54.633
His name was William Ming Jr.

33:54.633 --> 33:57.336
I look forward to seeing
you at the arraignment.

33:57.336 --> 33:59.438
- Thank you, William.
- You're welcome.

34:01.340 --> 34:04.543
Three years earlier he had
defended Martin Luther King Jr.

34:04.543 --> 34:07.813
on perjury charges,
winning him an acquittal

34:07.813 --> 34:10.015
in front of an all-white jury.

34:10.015 --> 34:14.553
And a few years before that,
he served on the legal team

34:14.553 --> 34:17.389
that won the landmark
U.S. Supreme Court case,

34:17.389 --> 34:20.226
Brown v. The Board
of Education.

34:24.763 --> 34:29.801
Ming was also involved
in the NAACP, the ACLU.

34:29.801 --> 34:32.138
Hef's very much
into Civil Rights,

34:32.138 --> 34:33.739
so it was a perfect match.

34:37.776 --> 34:41.813
Police yesterday carted two tons
of obscene magazines, films,

34:41.813 --> 34:45.417
and photographs to the city
incinerator and burned them.

34:45.417 --> 34:48.420
In the weeks leading up
to the trial,

34:48.420 --> 34:50.789
the city of Chicago
stepped up its efforts

34:50.789 --> 34:52.791
to damage our business.

34:52.791 --> 34:57.062
And anti-pornography activists
came out of the woodworks.

34:57.062 --> 35:00.299
Men who would stand by
and see their women

35:00.299 --> 35:03.101
degraded and debased
as they are with the breast

35:03.101 --> 35:07.606
and the buttock presentation
by Playboy are not men at all.

35:09.040 --> 35:10.909
But the more they attacked,

35:10.909 --> 35:13.945
the more I knew
I had to defend Playboy.

35:13.945 --> 35:17.483
In your June issue, you show
Jayne Mansfield unclothed,

35:17.483 --> 35:19.885
lying in bed with
a man fully clothed.

35:19.885 --> 35:21.153
Mm-hmm.

35:21.153 --> 35:22.854
It looks like
you're asking for it.

35:22.854 --> 35:24.856
- Why?
- Uh, you...

35:24.856 --> 35:28.093
It looks as though
the photograph is designed

35:28.093 --> 35:30.095
since we have both sexes
involved here...

35:30.095 --> 35:31.330
Mm-hmm.

35:31.330 --> 35:33.532
...solely to arouse
the viewer.

35:33.532 --> 35:35.801
The difficulty is most people
who get into censorship

35:35.801 --> 35:37.436
really know
very little about it.

35:37.436 --> 35:39.271
They don't know much
about it psychologically.

35:39.271 --> 35:41.273
They don't really recognize
the effect

35:41.273 --> 35:42.674
that these things have.

35:42.674 --> 35:44.109
And so what we were
really doing was, uh,

35:44.109 --> 35:46.478
reporting on a,
on a movie in the making

35:46.478 --> 35:49.281
and, uh, since a name
personality was involved,

35:49.281 --> 35:51.783
the pictures we felt
had legitimate
journalistic interest.

35:54.085 --> 35:56.788
This morning a man is
on trial in Chicago

35:56.788 --> 36:00.426
charged with violating that
city's laws against obscenity.

36:02.894 --> 36:06.398
He is Hugh Hefner,
publisher of Playboy magazine.

36:06.398 --> 36:09.000
Many court cases involving
motion pictures, books,

36:09.000 --> 36:12.037
and magazines have left
considerable gray areas

36:12.037 --> 36:14.640
in determining just
what is salacious and obscene.

36:18.344 --> 36:22.481
The trial began
on November 20, 1963,

36:22.481 --> 36:24.115
and from the beginning,

36:24.115 --> 36:29.054
jury selection put us
at a huge disadvantage.

36:29.054 --> 36:32.958
We discovered that they
essentially rigged the jury

36:32.958 --> 36:35.661
with not only almost all women,

36:35.661 --> 36:40.766
but people from very
conservative organizations.

36:43.702 --> 36:45.571
The moment the trial began,

36:45.571 --> 36:49.007
it was clear we were fighting
an uphill battle.

36:49.007 --> 36:50.842
For more than a decade,

36:50.842 --> 36:54.045
Playboy magazine has done more
to damage American values

36:54.045 --> 36:57.783
than any other publication
currently in circulation.

36:57.783 --> 37:01.820
It is up to you, ladies
and gentlemen of the jury,

37:01.820 --> 37:04.523
to protect the basic
human decency

37:04.523 --> 37:06.692
that this country stands for.

37:06.692 --> 37:09.661
Your sworn duty,
as members of the jury,

37:09.661 --> 37:13.465
is to defend and uphold the laws
of the Constitution.

37:13.465 --> 37:17.168
A constitution which
not only protects
the freedom of Mr. Hefner,

37:17.168 --> 37:20.238
but which also protect
the freedoms of your
fellow citizens.

37:20.238 --> 37:23.108
Hefner's point was,
you had the right not to buy,

37:23.108 --> 37:25.611
but not the right to deny it
to be seen and to be read.

37:25.611 --> 37:28.179
And when he was attacked
on that basis,

37:28.179 --> 37:30.849
he would not surrender
his First Amendment rights.

37:32.851 --> 37:36.288
The prosecution launched
into their case.

37:36.288 --> 37:38.123
Your honor, the prosecution

37:38.123 --> 37:40.025
would like to call
its first witness.

37:41.527 --> 37:43.362
In your professional opinion,

37:43.362 --> 37:45.464
do you find these pages
to be obscene?

37:45.464 --> 37:47.265
Without reservation.

37:47.265 --> 37:49.701
What do you think
is the aim of all this?

37:49.701 --> 37:53.805
In my opinion,
to stimulate or inflame

37:53.805 --> 37:56.375
the sexual appetite
of the average person.

37:56.375 --> 37:58.877
For nearly three weeks,

37:58.877 --> 38:01.880
the prosecution argued that
the pictures in Playboy

38:01.880 --> 38:04.950
could incite readers
to commit sexual crimes.

38:07.786 --> 38:09.821
Then something
unexpected happened.

38:20.499 --> 38:24.770
Kennedy's death was the first
presidential assassination
of our time.

38:27.172 --> 38:29.140
It was earth-shattering,

38:29.140 --> 38:33.812
and it would come
to define a generation.

38:33.812 --> 38:38.149
This is a sad time
for all people.

38:38.149 --> 38:42.688
We have suffered a loss
that cannot be weighed.

38:42.688 --> 38:44.956
The world came to a halt.

38:44.956 --> 38:50.195
For me, it is a deep,
personal tragedy.

38:50.195 --> 38:54.833
I know that the world
shares the sorrow

38:54.833 --> 38:58.904
thatMrs. Kennedy
and her family bear.

39:01.907 --> 39:03.942
His firm commitments
to support the cause

39:03.942 --> 39:06.144
of democracies
throughout the world...

39:06.144 --> 39:08.380
Suddenly, the future
of the progressive movement

39:08.380 --> 39:09.648
was in question.

39:09.648 --> 39:11.349
Across the country,

39:11.349 --> 39:14.119
a great outpouringof grief,
shock, and revulsion.

39:16.287 --> 39:20.759
JFK's assassination for
the generation of young people

39:20.759 --> 39:23.829
is the same as the attack
on Pearl Harbor was

39:23.829 --> 39:25.664
for the prior generation.

39:25.664 --> 39:28.734
Subsequent generations
the blowing up of the Challenger

39:28.734 --> 39:33.739
and 9/11 in that it destroys
the optimism and idealism.

39:33.739 --> 39:38.810
It is a break with a sense
of security in the past

39:38.810 --> 39:40.812
that everything was fine.

39:40.812 --> 39:44.850
And a reminder that
no one is invulnerable.

39:47.986 --> 39:49.955
But just as the country
was struggling

39:49.955 --> 39:51.957
to come to grips with the loss,

39:51.957 --> 39:55.694
and life seemed like it would
never get back to normal,

39:55.694 --> 39:58.229
it was finally time
to hear the verdict.

39:58.229 --> 40:02.100
And now, the fate
of the Playboy empire

40:02.100 --> 40:05.370
was in the hands
of the jury.

40:05.370 --> 40:07.172
Everything I had worked for

40:07.172 --> 40:09.675
would be affected
by this decision.

40:12.778 --> 40:16.815
* Every little movement *

40:16.815 --> 40:20.852
* Every motion of your hips *

40:20.852 --> 40:23.955
* I feel the compulsion *

40:23.955 --> 40:29.461
* To pull you
to my sweet lips *

40:29.461 --> 40:33.465
* Is it a black magic spell *

40:33.465 --> 40:35.534
* You put me under? *

40:37.235 --> 40:40.772
* This miracle moment *

40:40.772 --> 40:44.843
* Never let it end *

40:44.843 --> 40:47.813
* Every little movement *

40:48.880 --> 40:52.784
* Is beyond improvement *

40:52.784 --> 40:55.687
* You are the magician *

40:55.687 --> 41:00.659
* I've been wishing for
forever *

41:00.659 --> 41:04.763
* Every little movement *

41:04.763 --> 41:07.833
* Every little movement **
