03:29.793 --> 03:31.336
'...which was
at first thought to be the site'

03:31.545 --> 03:34.589
'of an old cemetery,
but proved to be a dry pond bed'

03:34.798 --> 03:37.175
'containing the remains
of several dead bodies.'

03:37.384 --> 03:38.635
'a special forensic team'

03:38.844 --> 03:40.720
'under the direction
of the county coroner'

03:40.929 --> 03:42.639
'has been helicoptered
to the site'

03:42.848 --> 03:45.517
'to dig out the mass grave
and to try to determine'

03:45.726 --> 03:48.812
'the victims' cause of death.
We'll bring you more details..'

03:49.020 --> 03:50.688
stop hiding
underneath those things.

03:52.399 --> 03:53.483
Ryan.

03:56.695 --> 03:58.154
What?

03:59.906 --> 04:01.782
Radio reception's shit.

04:02.409 --> 04:04.285
'So is our conversation.'

04:06.329 --> 04:07.955
'you should
be washed in the blood..'

04:08.165 --> 04:09.374
if we beat this thing to death,
we're just going

04:09.583 --> 04:10.834
to get mad, right?

04:11.626 --> 04:12.877
I don't wanna fight
anymore, okay?

04:13.086 --> 04:14.754
Me neither. What's the point?

04:14.963 --> 04:17.382
I mean, once we get to Florida,
you're off to New York.

04:17.591 --> 04:19.718
Then it's air britannia
all the way, right?

04:19.926 --> 04:22.386
We're over if we fight,
we're over if we don't fight.

04:23.054 --> 04:26.223
Look, I just need some time
on my own, okay?

04:26.433 --> 04:28.309
I mean, I wanted you on this
trip, so we could enjoy

04:28.518 --> 04:31.187
each other. We could talk.

04:31.396 --> 04:33.856
You mean talk or tiptoe around
the real issue with chit-chat?

04:34.065 --> 04:35.983
Now you sound exactly
like my father.

04:36.193 --> 04:37.319
Great.

04:38.153 --> 04:39.863
'Hey, turn it up.
We're getting something.'

04:40.071 --> 04:41.614
'...the site
of the grizzly mass grave'

04:41.823 --> 04:43.616
'has caused
the first ever traffic jam'

04:43.825 --> 04:45.201
'in the history
of the interstate.'

04:45.410 --> 04:46.953
'so if you're
a curious motorist'

04:47.162 --> 04:48.997
'be ready to prove
you're not a killer'

04:49.206 --> 04:50.248
'or you may have
to spend the night'

04:50.457 --> 04:52.375
'with a bunch of dead people.'

04:52.584 --> 04:55.169
'stay tuned..'

04:55.378 --> 04:56.754
could be worse.

04:58.215 --> 05:00.717
At least we're not as bad off as
those people in that body pit.

05:01.885 --> 05:03.428
- They were murdered.
- Mm.

05:03.637 --> 05:05.013
My god, they had to have been.

05:05.222 --> 05:07.432
They didn't jump in with
big grins and bathing suits.

05:09.226 --> 05:11.186
They ought to fry that sucker
if they find him.

05:12.771 --> 05:14.522
Violence is no answer
to violence.

05:14.731 --> 05:16.941
Yeah, well, welcome
to the real world, Michelle.

05:17.150 --> 05:18.818
You know, one of these days,
you're gonna have to live in it

05:19.027 --> 05:20.653
no matter where you run.

05:55.772 --> 05:57.356
Welcome to the
red light district.

05:57.566 --> 05:59.192
Are there
people in those bags?

05:59.401 --> 06:01.820
'Jeez, looks like we've
died and gone to hell.'

06:02.863 --> 06:04.739
'...have been discovered
<i>as</i> soon as we get the details..'

06:04.948 --> 06:06.908
let's not stick around
to meet any of 'em.

06:10.579 --> 06:11.997
'Hey, Scotty,
get your ass down here.'

06:12.205 --> 06:13.414
'make sure
you're zipped up tight.'

06:13.623 --> 06:15.958
'the coroner says
they're all toxic.'

06:16.167 --> 06:17.668
Roger, I'm coming down.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.963
Wouldn't wanna miss
all the poison pig shit.

06:33.727 --> 06:34.894
Oh, shit.

06:35.645 --> 06:37.563
We got more over here, Scotty.

06:37.772 --> 06:39.231
Well, fuck me running.

06:40.317 --> 06:42.360
Flash it before
you dig it out, okay?

06:42.569 --> 06:43.736
Yeah, right.

06:55.999 --> 06:59.043
'Be careful of that crap.
Blood poisonin'.'

06:59.252 --> 07:02.088
yeah, gas gangrene,
the coroner said.

07:02.297 --> 07:04.757
Just from touchin' this shit.

07:06.509 --> 07:09.053
Oh, god.

07:13.475 --> 07:15.351
Oh, man, I think I'm gonna barf.

07:15.560 --> 07:17.436
Not in front
of those news assholes.

07:17.854 --> 07:19.522
Far side of those trees.

07:21.232 --> 07:22.149
I should've listened
to my old man

07:22.359 --> 07:24.402
and went into real estate.

07:26.905 --> 07:29.741
Looks like a pretty advanced
stage of decomposition.

07:31.910 --> 07:34.454
It's like those body pits
we found up near dong tre.

07:36.498 --> 07:38.041
Just counting skulls

07:38.249 --> 07:40.751
'I'd say
we got 40 or 50 bodies here.'

07:40.961 --> 07:44.255
- Jesus.
- Oh, man.

07:45.799 --> 07:47.300
This is fucked.

07:53.014 --> 07:55.016
Sixty or seventy bodies, yes.

07:55.225 --> 07:57.685
It seems that when corpses,
uh, lay around like this

07:57.894 --> 08:00.730
for long periods of time
under conditions like these

08:00.939 --> 08:03.316
they putrefy into a substance

08:03.525 --> 08:06.736
called adip, uh, dip..
It's, uh..

08:06.945 --> 08:08.488
'Ahem. Excuse
me, ladies and gentlemen'

08:08.697 --> 08:09.906
'we seem to be experiencing..'

08:10.115 --> 08:11.825
adipocere, you idiot.

08:12.826 --> 08:15.703
Well, you would know that,
Mr. pre-med.

08:16.579 --> 08:18.622
Creamy breakdown of body fat.

08:18.832 --> 08:19.958
You see, basically,
if you're buried right

08:20.166 --> 08:22.168
your skin turns
into poison crisco.

08:25.171 --> 08:28.090
- I wanna get out of here.
- Uh-huh.

08:28.299 --> 08:29.758
We'll get out of here soon.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.803
Here comes old deputy dawg.

08:37.808 --> 08:40.852
- Comin' from?
- La.

08:41.062 --> 08:44.190
- 'Going to?'
- Deland, Florida.

08:44.399 --> 08:46.150
Somethin' wrong
with the airlines?

08:47.027 --> 08:49.446
No, I, uh, I'm delivering
this car to my father.

08:50.363 --> 08:53.115
- 'Do you wanna see the papers?'
- No, that's okay, ma'am.

08:53.324 --> 08:56.076
- Just hurry along.
- What happened here, anyway?

08:58.163 --> 08:59.581
None of your business, son.

09:00.665 --> 09:02.708
Just move along
and keep moving.

09:02.917 --> 09:04.835
Don't stop for nothin'
or nobody.

09:07.338 --> 09:08.839
Okay.

09:10.842 --> 09:12.385
'Didn't wanna be on TV anyway.'

09:12.594 --> 09:14.012
Ryan, please.

09:14.679 --> 09:16.180
'Now what's
bothering you, Michelle?'

09:16.389 --> 09:18.557
I just wanna get
this trip over with.

09:18.767 --> 09:20.935
'If I drive all night, I can.'

09:31.863 --> 09:33.489
do you think whoever
did that is still around?

09:33.698 --> 09:35.908
Nah, whoever
did that's long gone.

09:36.117 --> 09:38.911
Sounded like the bodies
were pretty decomposed too.

09:39.120 --> 09:41.205
- You see, what happens is--
- oh, Ryan, please.

09:41.414 --> 09:43.249
'Spare me the postmortems.'

09:44.667 --> 09:46.585
looks like we're about here.

09:49.881 --> 09:52.049
- Where?
- The middle of nowhere.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.322
Oh, my god.

10:17.242 --> 10:18.743
We can't just leave him here.

10:19.327 --> 10:20.536
I'll take care of it.

10:20.745 --> 10:22.913
- No, no.
- Michelle.

10:23.123 --> 10:24.791
No, it's my fault.

10:26.501 --> 10:27.543
I'll do it.

10:36.427 --> 10:38.262
I'm sorry, little guy.

10:53.194 --> 10:56.238
Ryan, I can't do it.

10:57.240 --> 10:58.366
Give it to me.

11:27.395 --> 11:28.813
- Thanks for the ride, mister.
- 'Sure.'

11:29.022 --> 11:30.732
- you drive real careful now.
- 'You bet.'

11:47.498 --> 11:49.583
you ladies are always
my favorite.

11:50.126 --> 11:51.418
You know that, huh?

12:00.595 --> 12:01.887
<i>Que pasa?</i>

12:21.199 --> 12:23.910
Well, looks like we got
some customers, ladies.

12:24.494 --> 12:25.828
You stay right here.

12:35.463 --> 12:36.755
You first.

12:37.465 --> 12:39.592
See if the bathroom's safe
for human use.

12:39.801 --> 12:40.885
Dream on.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.722
- You okay?
- Yeah.

12:49.394 --> 12:50.186
Hi.

13:10.999 --> 13:12.667
I got ya.
And I got ya good.

13:12.875 --> 13:14.418
Five bucks. It's only five
bucks. It's a good picture.

13:14.627 --> 13:16.920
What-what-what do you say?
3.69 okay? Just for you.

13:17.130 --> 13:18.172
3.69. Give it. 3.69.

13:18.381 --> 13:19.256
No, no, we're in a hurry.

13:19.465 --> 13:20.924
Could you just fill it up,
please?

13:22.427 --> 13:24.095
You're in a big hurry, huh?

13:26.347 --> 13:28.515
I'm gonna service you
real good, ma'am.

13:29.392 --> 13:30.935
Don't you worry about it.

13:37.483 --> 13:39.693
Little California
daddy's girl, huh?

13:41.863 --> 13:45.241
Bitch says fill it up, I'll fill
it up for you, mascara face.

13:45.450 --> 13:48.035
'Make you moan.
Make you moan real good.'

13:49.495 --> 13:51.747
you're gonna like it. Mm-hmm.

13:51.956 --> 13:53.707
You like me, don't you?

13:57.128 --> 13:58.629
'What's the matter,
shortcakes?'

13:59.297 --> 14:01.173
'don't you get uppity on me.'

14:01.382 --> 14:02.549
it's alright, ma'am.

14:03.468 --> 14:06.053
You ain't giving the lady
a hard time now, are you?

14:06.262 --> 14:08.055
I ain't bothering
nobody, mister.

14:08.598 --> 14:09.807
Uh-huh.

14:10.683 --> 14:12.893
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.

14:15.063 --> 14:16.647
He's a little touched.

14:16.856 --> 14:18.274
He's been that way
ever since he lost his job

14:18.483 --> 14:20.067
over at the old slaughterhouse.

14:21.361 --> 14:23.488
Sort of the town loony,
you might say.

14:25.698 --> 14:28.117
Well, looks like you had
yourself a little mishap here.

14:28.993 --> 14:30.995
We hit a little animal
on the road.

14:31.204 --> 14:33.039
Oh? Who's we?

14:34.374 --> 14:35.750
A friend and I.

14:36.042 --> 14:38.335
We, uh..
Well, I killed it.

14:40.213 --> 14:42.840
Well, I wouldn't worry
about that.

14:48.012 --> 14:49.805
There's roadkill all over Texas.

14:50.014 --> 14:51.598
Natural order of things.

14:53.518 --> 14:54.727
Besides

14:56.062 --> 14:58.105
if you were the last thing
i saw before I died

14:58.815 --> 15:00.233
I'd die a happy man.

15:06.697 --> 15:08.824
Don't you ever do that
to me, bitch.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.269
- Who's this?
- Hi.

15:36.978 --> 15:38.729
Uh, you can call me Tex.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.356
Yippee-aye-ye.

15:42.400 --> 15:44.985
Listen, uh, I'd be glad
to buy you both a beer.

15:45.194 --> 15:46.653
You know, whatever you need
if I can catch

15:46.863 --> 15:48.239
a ride as far as brownsville.

15:48.448 --> 15:51.117
Hmm. Sorry, Tex. We're on
a pretty tight schedule today.

15:53.494 --> 15:55.662
That right? You in a big hurry?

15:56.497 --> 15:58.457
Well, we could discuss it,
i guess.

15:59.167 --> 16:00.001
Okay.

16:02.378 --> 16:04.296
Gotta go to the bathroom.
Ls it over there?

16:04.797 --> 16:06.089
Yeah, change your life.

16:14.098 --> 16:15.974
Real nice car you have here.

16:18.728 --> 16:19.770
Thanks.

16:57.767 --> 16:59.810
You know, if you are headed
to Houston, that, uh

17:00.061 --> 17:02.271
road over there
is the quickest way.

17:02.480 --> 17:04.356
Oh, no, it's a straight shot
on the highway.

17:04.565 --> 17:07.818
Yeah, well, it used to be,
but, uh, this new road here

17:08.027 --> 17:09.987
is a hell lot quicker.

17:10.195 --> 17:11.655
'You got a map?'

17:12.865 --> 17:15.450
- yeah, I got a map.
- Oh, yeah. I'll show you.

17:17.744 --> 17:18.787
Okay.

17:29.549 --> 17:30.925
<i>Jesus.</i>

17:50.361 --> 17:51.236
See?

17:52.863 --> 17:53.947
Yeah, I see.

17:54.782 --> 17:56.992
See? 1973.

17:58.661 --> 18:00.913
That road over there
ought to be right there.

18:01.122 --> 18:02.498
Ain't even on this map.

18:03.833 --> 18:06.085
What's the damn difference?
The distance looks the same.

18:06.752 --> 18:08.962
Difference is it ain't
a good idea to be messin' around

18:09.171 --> 18:10.881
these backroads at night
when you don't know

18:11.090 --> 18:12.591
where you're going.

18:16.262 --> 18:17.763
Look, man.

18:19.974 --> 18:21.684
I'm just trying to get home.

18:22.184 --> 18:23.977
Yeah, I understand
you're trying to get home.

18:24.186 --> 18:26.354
But listen to me.
We can't help you, okay?

18:26.564 --> 18:27.439
I'm sorry.

18:36.532 --> 18:38.283
Where'd that little weasel
get to?

18:58.596 --> 19:01.432
- Let's go, you shit heap!
- Skinny son of a bitch!

19:01.641 --> 19:02.808
I was only lookin' at her!

19:03.017 --> 19:04.977
She liked it! She liked it fine!
Just ask her!

19:05.186 --> 19:07.271
Why don't you just
shut up, stupid?

19:08.230 --> 19:09.814
You shut the fuck up,
motherfucker. This is my place!

19:10.024 --> 19:11.900
I'll do whatever I want
in my place!

19:12.693 --> 19:14.027
What's wrong?

19:14.236 --> 19:16.154
Uh, he's having himself
a peekaboo party

19:16.364 --> 19:17.990
with you as the star.

19:18.199 --> 19:19.491
I think I'm gonna puke.

19:22.536 --> 19:23.703
Folks, I think
you better get in your car.

19:23.913 --> 19:26.457
- What's wrong?
- Go! Go!

19:26.666 --> 19:28.876
- He's got a gun.
- Get the hell out of here!

19:29.085 --> 19:31.212
...god's gift, huh?

19:31.420 --> 19:32.754
Start the car.
Michelle, start the car!

19:32.963 --> 19:34.506
...goddammit.

19:34.715 --> 19:36.508
You're too good for me, huh?
You're too good for me?

19:36.717 --> 19:38.719
Come on, get the hell out of
here! I'll take care of him.

19:38.928 --> 19:40.304
I'll take you down
right here, cowboy!

19:40.513 --> 19:41.805
Go, go, go! Come on!

19:42.014 --> 19:44.391
You heifer butt,
I'm gonna fuck you in hell!

19:45.101 --> 19:46.268
You wanna fuck me, baby,
i know you do!

19:46.477 --> 19:47.853
First time you saw me,
you liked me.

19:48.062 --> 19:49.688
That's the kind of guy I am!

19:51.732 --> 19:52.566
Jesus Christ!

19:57.530 --> 19:58.405
Holy fuck, he dusted him!

19:58.614 --> 20:00.157
What happened? Dusted who?

20:00.366 --> 20:01.784
The cowboy! He shot the cowboy!

20:01.992 --> 20:03.994
- What?
- Go! Drive faster! Go!

20:04.203 --> 20:06.663
We gotta find the cops.
That town.

20:07.623 --> 20:09.583
What if there isn't any town?
Just drive, drive, drive!

20:09.792 --> 20:11.835
- Where?
- There.

20:12.044 --> 20:14.421
- Take the cowboy's route.
- What are you talking about--

20:14.630 --> 20:16.923
turn right! Go, go, 90!

20:58.883 --> 21:01.635
It's armageddon, bitchface!

21:01.844 --> 21:04.346
It's armageddon, you bitch!

21:04.555 --> 21:05.973
Goddammit.

21:06.182 --> 21:08.184
Trap is sprung now, honey.

21:17.109 --> 21:18.193
I thought there was
a town around here.

21:18.402 --> 21:20.612
That's what he told me.
Would you just slow down?

21:20.821 --> 21:22.280
I'm not stopping
until we find somebody.

21:22.490 --> 21:24.116
Well, we're gonna find somebody.

21:25.534 --> 21:26.535
Michelle, we're far away
from that guy.

21:26.744 --> 21:28.120
He's not gonna get us.

21:29.205 --> 21:30.456
Would you turn it off?

21:36.962 --> 21:38.213
Shit.

21:38.422 --> 21:39.756
Would you calm down?
It's just a tire tread--

21:39.965 --> 21:40.966
stop yelling at me!

21:41.175 --> 21:42.009
Look, if you would just
listen to me--

21:42.218 --> 21:43.969
shh! Listen.

21:46.597 --> 21:48.098
- Ryan?
- Yeah.

21:52.895 --> 21:54.855
- Where's it coming from?
- I don't know.

22:02.905 --> 22:05.198
- Oh, my god.
- It's coming from behind us!

22:08.244 --> 22:09.411
Fuck!

22:11.455 --> 22:13.290
He's gaining on us!

22:14.083 --> 22:15.584
- Who is it?
- I don't know.

22:32.935 --> 22:34.937
Oh, my god!
What do they want from us?

22:40.901 --> 22:42.611
Oh, my god! Aah!

22:45.114 --> 22:46.532
'Gee.'.

22:57.793 --> 23:00.712
- We hit another one.
- No, it hit us.

23:01.338 --> 23:02.547
He threw it at us.

23:03.299 --> 23:05.175
Where the fuck are they?

23:05.384 --> 23:07.094
We blew a tire.

23:08.929 --> 23:10.138
Why are, why are they
doing this to us?

23:10.347 --> 23:13.058
- Ryan.
- This is not happening.

23:13.267 --> 23:15.686
It's happening!
It's happening to us.

23:15.895 --> 23:18.480
Now we gotta change this tire
and get out of here now.

23:19.982 --> 23:21.024
Okay.

23:21.233 --> 23:22.817
Slow and easy

23:23.027 --> 23:24.987
'cause I'm about
to fuckin' lose my mind!

23:27.072 --> 23:30.283
Get, get out the Jack, please.

23:35.664 --> 23:37.624
I'll take care of him.

23:50.095 --> 23:51.304
'Come on.'

23:53.098 --> 23:54.474
get the light.

23:56.185 --> 23:57.728
That goes this way.

23:57.937 --> 23:59.605
Let me help you.
We gotta move it.

23:59.813 --> 24:01.564
'I gotta put in
a couple of lug nuts.'

24:05.945 --> 24:06.987
did you hear that?

24:09.406 --> 24:11.950
'Hurry up. I think
that truck is coming back.'

24:19.208 --> 24:21.043
doesn't sound like
a truck to me.

24:22.461 --> 24:24.129
No, it doesn't.

24:27.967 --> 24:30.135
Michelle, I could use a little
light down here, please.

24:35.474 --> 24:37.767
Finish it, Ryan. Finish it now.

24:46.944 --> 24:49.071
- Michelle.
- I'm serious.

24:50.364 --> 24:52.449
- Hurry up, Ryan.
- 'Almost there.'

24:56.704 --> 24:57.913
Michelle.

24:59.498 --> 25:00.665
'I need the light.'

25:00.874 --> 25:03.418
- I mean it.
- Almost there.

25:08.716 --> 25:10.008
It's done?

25:13.345 --> 25:15.055
'It's gonna have to do.
Let's hit it.'

25:20.728 --> 25:22.271
'run, Ryan!'

25:24.648 --> 25:27.150
- get in!
- It's locked! It's locked!

25:28.360 --> 25:29.694
- Get in!
- Aah!

25:31.530 --> 25:32.822
Let's

25:39.288 --> 25:40.706
go, go, go!

25:42.833 --> 25:44.376
It won't go into gear!

25:47.337 --> 25:49.797
Go! Get out of here!

25:56.764 --> 25:58.474
We hit him! We hit him!

26:03.187 --> 26:05.022
He's coming up the back! Go!

26:13.864 --> 26:15.365
- 'Yes!'
- What happened?

26:15.574 --> 26:17.033
Did we lose him?

26:21.246 --> 26:23.206
He cut our trunk.

26:23.415 --> 26:24.707
<i>Jesus.</i>

26:43.685 --> 26:45.103
'Ooh.'

26:50.192 --> 26:51.902
we have to pull over,
so I can fix the lug nuts.

26:52.111 --> 26:54.404
- I'm not stopping.
- I gotta finish tightening 'em.

26:56.031 --> 26:57.407
We're gonna lose a tire,
you have to pull over

26:57.616 --> 26:58.408
so I can fix it.

26:58.617 --> 27:00.118
I'm not stopping.

27:05.666 --> 27:09.252
Listen to me. I'm not taking
any more chances.

27:09.461 --> 27:12.755
Now you pull this car over,
so I can fix the goddamn tire!

27:14.216 --> 27:15.383
Alright.

27:23.642 --> 27:24.768
Jesus!

27:38.657 --> 27:40.075
'Damn it.'

27:43.829 --> 27:44.955
totaled.

28:29.374 --> 28:30.583
Oh, je..

28:31.793 --> 28:33.169
<i>Jesus.</i>

28:52.648 --> 28:55.233
- Aah!
- Take it easy! Take it easy.

28:55.442 --> 28:57.318
You're gonna be okay.
Take it easy.

28:57.527 --> 29:00.738
We gotta get her out.
Please, help me get her out.

29:00.948 --> 29:02.991
I'll get her out.
You just get away from the car.

29:03.200 --> 29:04.451
Get away from the car.

29:34.439 --> 29:36.441
We gotta keep moving.

29:36.650 --> 29:38.276
We can't stick around here.

29:39.611 --> 29:42.864
Pal, you can't even
stand around right now.

29:43.699 --> 29:45.117
Well, you just take care.

29:45.492 --> 29:47.744
Th-there's some people
after us.

29:48.495 --> 29:50.371
A guy with a chainsaw.

29:50.580 --> 29:52.999
- You saw what?
- A chainsaw.

29:55.252 --> 29:58.338
Uh-huh. Listen, I don't want you
to move right now.

29:58.547 --> 30:00.799
Sounds like
you're just a few quarts

30:01.008 --> 30:03.135
shy of a full tank,
you know what I mean?

30:03.343 --> 30:05.219
- Hold still. Hold still.
- There's a bunch of guys.

30:05.429 --> 30:06.805
- And they have guns too.
- 'Yeah, I know.'

30:07.014 --> 30:09.933
and chainsaws.
Militant lumberjacks.

30:10.142 --> 30:11.726
I see 'em all the time.

30:11.935 --> 30:13.811
Here, I want you
to take one of these.

30:20.319 --> 30:21.987
'I can't believe it.'

30:22.195 --> 30:25.489
'I've been going up in the hills
every weekend for two years.'

30:26.033 --> 30:28.285
'I've never even seen
another car on that road.'

30:29.494 --> 30:32.371
I've got a survival camp
with a few buddies of mine.

30:32.581 --> 30:34.374
Tryin' to keep in training
for the big blowup.

30:34.583 --> 30:36.084
You know what I mean?

30:36.293 --> 30:38.128
Do you hear what
I'm saying, man?

30:38.337 --> 30:39.880
We're being hunted!

30:41.506 --> 30:42.673
Hunted?

30:43.759 --> 30:46.136
Yeah, right. I hear you, man.

30:49.097 --> 30:51.390
- Ryan.
- Okay, take it easy.

30:51.600 --> 30:53.393
Take it easy. You're alright.

30:53.602 --> 30:54.769
Most of this stuff
looks superficial.

30:54.978 --> 30:57.355
Just sit up.
There we go. Okay.

30:57.564 --> 30:59.065
Here, I want you
to take one of these.

30:59.941 --> 31:00.983
Okay?

31:02.235 --> 31:03.194
A little water.

31:06.073 --> 31:07.991
Tex, he's still up there.

31:08.200 --> 31:08.992
Who?

31:10.202 --> 31:11.536
Who are you?

31:11.745 --> 31:13.788
- My name's Benny.
- Ow.

31:13.997 --> 31:16.666
I'm the sorry-ass bastard
you almost hit.

31:16.875 --> 31:18.751
We gotta move.
They might find us.

31:20.879 --> 31:24.257
- You people are serious.
- 'Mister, do you see this?'

31:41.400 --> 31:43.735
- how many?
- We don't know.

31:43.944 --> 31:45.904
Two, maybe more.

31:46.113 --> 31:48.323
One's on foot and he's got that.

31:53.412 --> 31:55.372
That's an awfully big saw.

31:55.997 --> 31:58.457
Tex. Did you see him out there?

31:58.917 --> 32:00.835
No, I couldn't see nothing
except your headlights.

32:01.044 --> 32:03.838
He could still be up there.
We gotta go check on him.

32:04.047 --> 32:06.799
- Whoa.
- Wait a minute.

32:07.008 --> 32:09.468
- What did you give us?
- Painkillers.

32:09.678 --> 32:11.221
Might make you
a little sleepy.

32:11.430 --> 32:14.808
What? Are you nuts?
We have got to move.

32:15.016 --> 32:17.351
Now just hold it. Hold it.
I can handle this.

32:17.561 --> 32:19.271
I'm prepared
for this kind of thing.

32:19.479 --> 32:21.898
Now you guys just relax
and I'll go find your friend.

32:22.107 --> 32:23.858
No, man. They're out there.

32:24.067 --> 32:26.402
Look, pal, it doesn't
make it any different

32:26.611 --> 32:28.362
from anywhere else.

32:28.572 --> 32:30.615
Now I'll go get some goodies
out of the Jeep

32:31.366 --> 32:33.034
and find your buddy.

32:33.243 --> 32:35.495
Stay put, okay?

32:37.330 --> 32:39.832
- Wait.
- Wait a minute.

32:40.041 --> 32:42.293
'Sit down or you'll fall down.'

33:10.864 --> 33:13.199
looks like you had
a little mishap.

33:14.784 --> 33:16.827
Hey, mister,
I'm glad you came along.

33:17.037 --> 33:18.413
My Jeep and this car,
we had a--

33:18.622 --> 33:21.458
you had an accident.
Already know that.

33:30.091 --> 33:31.675
Michelle.

33:33.845 --> 33:35.137
Michelle, come on,
we gotta get out of here.

33:35.347 --> 33:36.056
No.

33:37.849 --> 33:39.183
We gotta..

33:45.023 --> 33:46.232
So pretty.

33:46.733 --> 33:48.568
So beautiful, the glow.

33:50.862 --> 33:52.947
Technology's your friend,
you know?

33:53.865 --> 33:55.366
Yeah, right. Listen, mister.

33:55.575 --> 33:58.452
I got some people hurt down here
and i-l need your help.

33:58.662 --> 34:01.623
We got the means.
We got the machines.

34:01.831 --> 34:06.331
Look, buddy, I need you
to help me turn my Jeep up.

34:06.545 --> 34:08.045
You mean upright?

34:08.964 --> 34:11.466
Yeah, right side up.

34:11.675 --> 34:13.551
Well, what do you think
all these fucking flares

34:13.760 --> 34:15.636
are for, stupid?

34:17.681 --> 34:19.516
Yeah. Thanks a lot, buddy.

34:35.489 --> 34:37.617
Just a second.
I gotta get something.

34:40.120 --> 34:41.871
Well, rocket, brother.

34:49.588 --> 34:50.839
Oh, now.

35:09.566 --> 35:11.568
You ready to roll, young yeoman?

35:15.071 --> 35:16.530
Just 15 seconds!

35:24.998 --> 35:26.874
Almost home, Lucille.

35:43.892 --> 35:45.810
Push comes to shove.

35:53.860 --> 35:54.902
Shit.

36:03.912 --> 36:04.996
'Shit-l

36:06.623 --> 36:07.373
whoa!

36:14.047 --> 36:14.839
<i>Jesus.</i>

36:26.810 --> 36:28.019
Huh?

37:18.278 --> 37:19.988
Hey, scumbag! Here!

37:20.905 --> 37:22.531
You want me, not him!

37:56.107 --> 37:57.858
- Michelle.
- Hmm?

37:58.902 --> 38:00.236
I can hear him.

38:00.445 --> 38:02.238
We gotta get out of here.

38:02.447 --> 38:04.365
How long have we been out?

38:05.200 --> 38:06.701
I don't know.

38:06.910 --> 38:08.661
We have to metabolize
this shit out of our system

38:08.870 --> 38:10.746
or we're gonna be down
for the rest of the night.

38:12.582 --> 38:14.667
We gotta find the road or..

38:15.794 --> 38:17.670
...a house, something.

38:17.879 --> 38:20.172
Any place is better than here.
We're sitting ducks out here.

38:22.091 --> 38:23.759
Where's the goddamn sunrise?

38:23.968 --> 38:25.803
This is gonna have
to do for now. Come on.

38:33.228 --> 38:34.520
I can't hear him anymore.

39:05.593 --> 39:07.553
Who the hell are you?

39:29.993 --> 39:31.786
What the hell's goin' on?

39:32.829 --> 39:34.330
What's goin' on?

39:38.501 --> 39:41.128
Hey, girl, I need
some questions answered

39:41.337 --> 39:42.796
and I need them
answered right now.

39:43.006 --> 39:44.590
Do you understand me?

39:44.799 --> 39:45.883
Hey!

39:46.551 --> 39:48.302
'Oh, god.'

39:53.057 --> 39:54.516
I'm sorry.

39:56.728 --> 39:58.813
I didn't know
you were hurt that bad.

40:01.524 --> 40:03.984
The party's still cookin'.
They're still out there.

40:07.864 --> 40:09.490
You some kind of soldier
or what?

40:10.533 --> 40:12.409
Just on the weekends.

40:16.205 --> 40:17.873
Wrong weapon, wrong war.

40:19.167 --> 40:22.503
They got us a week ago.
I'm the only one left.

40:22.712 --> 40:25.297
Me and my sister. Sisters.

40:27.258 --> 40:28.801
We go together.

40:29.510 --> 40:32.012
Week, maybe five days ago.

40:32.221 --> 40:33.305
A week?

40:33.848 --> 40:35.307
What the hell
are you still doin' here?

40:35.516 --> 40:37.267
Keep your voice down!

40:39.938 --> 40:41.522
They watch the road.

40:43.399 --> 40:45.025
They hunt people.

40:47.528 --> 40:50.155
They really hunt them, they
trap them and they kill them.

40:52.200 --> 40:54.493
'L haven't been able
to get out of the woods.'

40:55.328 --> 40:58.289
we just stopped
to help this guy.

40:59.123 --> 41:01.166
We thought he'd been run over.

41:04.003 --> 41:06.922
Day before yesterday,
i had to eat a fuckin' rat raw.

41:08.967 --> 41:10.718
And some berries that tasted

41:10.927 --> 41:13.012
tasted like they'd been
thrown up once already.

41:13.221 --> 41:15.556
It's just, I mean.. It..

41:20.937 --> 41:22.355
Right here.

41:29.278 --> 41:31.488
Thanks for what you did.

41:33.116 --> 41:34.659
Thanks.

41:37.203 --> 41:40.623
- Where is the road?
- Ah. I don't know.

41:40.832 --> 41:43.709
I heard some noises.
Maybe it's that guy, Benny.

41:43.918 --> 41:46.879
Nah, he took off
a long time ago.

41:47.088 --> 41:48.005
Who knows how long we were out?

41:48.214 --> 41:49.590
- Benny!
- Shh.

42:03.938 --> 42:05.230
Thanks.

42:21.372 --> 42:23.123
'Benny?

42:26.961 --> 42:29.421
- I gotta go.
- They'll be dead soon.

42:30.965 --> 42:33.384
Maybe I can bring the bad guys
out in the light.

42:35.970 --> 42:37.221
You comin'?

42:41.434 --> 42:42.935
Alright, you stay here.

42:43.144 --> 42:45.437
Don't move.
I'll be right back.

42:47.774 --> 42:49.025
Hold up.

42:53.112 --> 42:54.363
'Keep it.'

42:56.866 --> 42:57.992
thanks.

43:45.331 --> 43:47.207
Nice neighborhood.

44:46.225 --> 44:47.017
Damn.

45:44.367 --> 45:46.285
- Come on.
- Aah! Aah!

45:46.494 --> 45:47.745
- Aah!

45:50.414 --> 45:51.331
Ryan.

45:55.795 --> 45:57.254
- Come on.
- Oh, god, help!

45:57.463 --> 45:59.590
Go! Get out of here!

46:00.967 --> 46:02.551
'Get out of here!'

46:06.347 --> 46:07.389

46:10.726 --> 46:13.228
No!God!

46:13.437 --> 46:15.188
Please, no!

46:18.234 --> 46:19.485
No!

46:57.565 --> 46:58.774
Hello?

47:00.359 --> 47:01.568
Hello?

47:05.072 --> 47:06.531
'Hello?'

47:28.679 --> 47:30.097
wait, wait.

47:53.829 --> 47:54.538
Hey.

47:55.331 --> 47:56.790
'It's alright. It's alright.'

47:57.166 --> 47:58.250
'l'm not gonna hurt you.'

47:59.794 --> 48:01.420
what's your name?

48:03.964 --> 48:05.757
This is Sally.

48:12.181 --> 48:14.516
Yakkety-yak, don't talk back.

48:20.689 --> 48:22.691
Girls, sorry to butt in

48:22.900 --> 48:25.402
but, uh, looks like you had
yourself another little mishap.

48:29.615 --> 48:31.158
You know, you're late.

48:32.660 --> 48:33.535
Hm?

48:34.829 --> 48:36.997
They really just get
dumber and dumber.

48:38.374 --> 48:39.666
Don't they?

48:43.212 --> 48:44.588
Don't they?

48:50.052 --> 48:51.887
'No! No!'

49:11.782 --> 49:13.325
I ain't no runt of the litter

49:13.534 --> 49:16.036
and I'll prove it to you
one day.

49:16.245 --> 49:19.122
'What, you think I'm some sort
of a piece of shit?'

49:19.331 --> 49:21.416
'there's gonna come a time
when you're gonna find out'

49:21.625 --> 49:23.376
'just what kind
of a human being I am.'

49:23.586 --> 49:25.087
'l'm a human being.'

49:25.921 --> 49:28.506
bone patrol
for stupid fuckface, eh?

49:28.716 --> 49:30.718
I'll show you, motherfuckers.

49:32.011 --> 49:33.887
'That's the way it is.'

49:36.348 --> 49:37.390
$0..

49:38.976 --> 49:40.268
...how'd you like Texas?

49:47.276 --> 49:49.653
More little nails
if you don't stay put.

49:51.363 --> 49:53.990
Why are you doing this?

49:54.200 --> 49:56.911
Because if you don't poke 'em,
then they don't leak.

49:58.245 --> 50:02.165
And if they don't leak,
we can't feed grandpa.

50:02.374 --> 50:03.458
Silly.

50:10.716 --> 50:15.053
'Ruckus,ruckus.
My nap is just a goner.'

50:15.262 --> 50:18.932
I certainly hope you children
are pleased with yourselves.

50:20.184 --> 50:22.060
Where's junior?

50:23.062 --> 50:25.522
He's mopping up, mama.

50:25.731 --> 50:28.775
Uh, uh-huh.

50:28.984 --> 50:32.070
'That's what you always say.'

50:32.279 --> 50:34.114
moppin' up.

50:34.323 --> 50:36.825
Uh, which means
you ain't caught 'em all yet

50:37.034 --> 50:39.036
just like last time.

50:39.954 --> 50:41.205
Please.

50:42.289 --> 50:43.957
'What have we done?'

50:44.625 --> 50:46.418
can't you stop this?

50:51.340 --> 50:54.384
You best shut on up
or I'll do your tongue first.

50:56.095 --> 50:59.723
That's right. Best not to get
mama's dander up.

51:06.564 --> 51:08.190
Brought home the bacon, mama.

51:08.399 --> 51:10.484
Flaughs] Come on, Tex.
Give me a hand here.

51:12.236 --> 51:14.154
'Alright. Pull him around.
Pull him around.'

51:15.948 --> 51:17.532
'we need to get that trap off.'

51:21.495 --> 51:23.288
'hm, fancy sneakers.'

51:26.208 --> 51:27.626
'alright now.'

51:32.673 --> 51:34.299
'okay, don't bruise him.'

51:39.597 --> 51:41.015
'pretty good size, ain't he?'

51:41.223 --> 51:43.016
- 'yeah, he's a keeper.'
- 'Alright.'

51:57.364 --> 51:59.699
we got some dark meat
coming in, too, mama.

51:59.908 --> 52:02.160
Junior will be trotting it in
any minute.

52:02.369 --> 52:04.120
If he minds.

52:14.632 --> 52:17.051
Well, junior's been getting
out of hand lately.

52:18.218 --> 52:20.053
But I got a present for him.

52:20.262 --> 52:22.555
I got a fine present.
Gonna keep him in line.

52:22.765 --> 52:23.891
Yes, sir.

52:24.933 --> 52:26.184
He liked that last present
you got him.

52:26.393 --> 52:29.813

electronic thingumajig.

52:30.022 --> 52:33.108
Of course, he did.
That's progress, boy.

52:33.317 --> 52:35.819
Technology is our friend.

52:36.987 --> 52:38.989
He might even learn something.
Ain't that right, mama?

52:43.369 --> 52:44.870
What do you think
of our little lady?

52:49.333 --> 52:50.709
Uncertain.

52:51.752 --> 52:55.297
She looks to me like she might
go all screamy on us, Eddie.

52:59.426 --> 53:01.386
I wish you'd call me Tex.

53:02.221 --> 53:03.472
I told you.

53:05.265 --> 53:07.392
I'm sorry, boy.
Goddammit, I'm sorry.

53:12.648 --> 53:15.359

'Say, Tex,

54:22.468 --> 54:24.052
'that thing's so damn heavy.'

54:25.596 --> 54:27.431
don't even think of leaving.

54:27.639 --> 54:29.390
Not before dinner.

54:40.569 --> 54:41.903

55:29.701 --> 55:33.246
it's a hand for a hand
and an arm for an arm.

55:33.455 --> 55:35.457

You tell him what to do,

55:52.057 --> 55:54.434
Little Alfredo does this,

55:57.938 --> 55:59.689

Hey, pretty one.

56:15.163 --> 56:17.039
We had some good times,
didn't we?

56:23.088 --> 56:24.923
We don't have
good times no more.

56:26.383 --> 56:30.178
You remind me of my last girl
down in tupelo.

56:30.387 --> 56:32.472
Well, you're gonna go

56:35.183 --> 56:36.851

Well, looks like
you just got a present

58:32.342 --> 58:34.385

58:34.594 --> 58:36.429
You lost the darky, didn't you?

58:38.265 --> 58:39.391
Well, didn't you?

58:43.979 --> 58:46.856
Oh, fine. Another toy.

58:47.065 --> 58:48.441
Well, you gotta learn.

58:53.113 --> 58:54.614
I'll tell you one damn thing,

58:59.661 --> 59:00.953

59:52.297 --> 59:53.172
Huh?

'Let me see a smile.'

59:57.677 --> 59:59.637
- let's do it.
- Alright.

59:59.846 --> 01:00:02.390
Why don't you go
and do your lessons?

01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:08.604
And get that thing
off my cutting board.

01:00:20.659 --> 01:00:22.702
Hey, who's been dinkin'

01:00:24.496 --> 01:00:25.788
Trap's sprung-

01:00:29.459 --> 01:00:31.335
somebody's on the loose.
That's for sure.

01:00:36.299 --> 01:00:37.174
Shh.

01:00:37.759 --> 01:00:40.386
'This makes a very loud bang'

01:00:40.595 --> 01:00:42.888
and an awfully big hole.

01:00:44.641 --> 01:00:46.017
Do I know you?

01:00:46.226 --> 01:00:48.269
Shut up and move it!

01:00:48.478 --> 01:00:50.688
Now I am very scared
of guns, mister.

01:00:50.897 --> 01:00:53.024
So please do not point that
at my face.

01:00:53.233 --> 01:00:55.109

- 'How many what, oj?'

01:00:55.318 --> 01:00:58.487

01:01:00.031 --> 01:01:01.407
Hey, baby, I only got
one thing to say to you.

01:01:01.616 --> 01:01:02.783
Do you know what that is?

01:01:02.993 --> 01:01:04.911
I don't like the tone
of your voice.

01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:06.663
'What the hell's
wrong with you?'

01:01:08.248 --> 01:01:09.374
what is this?

01:01:09.583 --> 01:01:11.668
Booby traps, camo netting.

01:01:13.962 --> 01:01:15.880
What are you people

01:01:16.882 --> 01:01:18.091
Big surprise.

01:01:19.968 --> 01:01:21.386
Fuck you, mister!

01:01:37.027 --> 01:01:38.194

01:02:43.635 --> 01:02:45.887
'Please choose an activity.'

01:02:47.472 --> 01:02:48.973

01:02:53.228 --> 01:02:57.232

'f-o-o-d.'

01:03:34.769 --> 01:03:36.520
'no, try again.'

01:03:36.730 --> 01:03:39.566
what kind of sick shit is this?

01:03:39.774 --> 01:03:43.319
'F-o-o-d.'

01:03:45.530 --> 01:03:47.532
'no, try again.'

01:04:06.593 --> 01:04:09.637

You promised.

01:04:46.299 --> 01:04:48.050
'Let me do it.'

01:04:50.595 --> 01:04:52.555
I don't see why not.

01:04:52.764 --> 01:04:53.931
No!

01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:57.727
Alright, darling. Go ahead.

01:04:58.353 --> 01:04:59.604
'Hell, she's old enough.'

01:05:01.773 --> 01:05:03.065

01:05:07.862 --> 01:05:08.821

01:05:11.116 --> 01:05:12.325
Okay.

Remember what I told you.
You take this one here.

01:05:15.578 --> 01:05:19.290
You have to count

01:05:19.999 --> 01:05:21.417
Alright. I will.

01:05:22.377 --> 01:05:25.046
Grab on. When I tell you.

Good shot. Good shot.

01:05:56.995 --> 01:05:57.996
Go get it.

01:06:11.342 --> 01:06:14.094

01:06:39.245 --> 01:06:40.955
Yeah, I guess that's right, huh?

01:06:41.414 --> 01:06:43.290
All we need now
is a good mess of Greens.

01:06:56.429 --> 01:06:58.556
Appears we get to wait
a spell on you.

01:07:01.893 --> 01:07:03.978
Maybe we could, uh

01:07:04.187 --> 01:07:06.355
let junior play some.

01:07:08.566 --> 01:07:10.818
'He does make the sweetest
damn babies, you know.'

01:07:12.529 --> 01:07:15.657
junior likes them private parts.

01:07:16.616 --> 01:07:19.702
We knows what to do
with them parts.

01:07:20.161 --> 01:07:21.954
You got that right, mama.

01:07:22.163 --> 01:07:26.663
Cut my own out years back.

01:07:27.168 --> 01:07:28.544
I did.

01:07:29.837 --> 01:07:31.797
Took care of papa's too.

01:07:33.466 --> 01:07:35.217
It'll be your turn soon,
little gal.

01:07:36.678 --> 01:07:38.554
'Hey, Tex,
come help me skin this.'

01:07:40.306 --> 01:07:41.223
'alrighty-'

01:07:45.937 --> 01:07:47.229
junior.

01:08:24.934 --> 01:08:26.602
'Go, junior!'

01:08:42.743 --> 01:08:43.578
motherfucker!

01:08:47.165 --> 01:08:48.666
'Get down!'

01:08:49.959 --> 01:08:51.877
mama!

01:08:52.086 --> 01:08:53.337
'Mama!'

01:09:00.761 --> 01:09:01.888
tink!

01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:24.660
Get the bitch! Get the bitch!

01:09:36.421 --> 01:09:39.133
'Aah! She stuck me.
She stuck me!'

01:09:40.426 --> 01:09:41.426
'bitch!'

01:09:42.011 --> 01:09:43.886
hey,hey

01:09:44.096 --> 01:09:46.182
hey, hey, hey, it's me!
It's me!

01:09:47.265 --> 01:09:48.809
- Let's go!
- Run, run!

01:09:53.564 --> 01:09:54.690
Go!

01:10:01.197 --> 01:10:04.116
Shit! Now what? Great!

01:10:04.575 --> 01:10:06.952
Alright, go towards the trees.
Towards the trees! Go!

01:10:12.166 --> 01:10:13.417
Okay, come on.

01:10:16.045 --> 01:10:17.087
Shit!

01:10:35.148 --> 01:10:37.191
Okay. Alright.

01:10:37.859 --> 01:10:39.151
You and me then, huh?

01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:42.154
You sick fucker!

01:10:45.908 --> 01:10:48.201
Come on! Come on!

01:10:56.002 --> 01:10:58.504
Fuck the flesh! Give me steel!

01:11:00.298 --> 01:11:01.882
'Now damn it, boy.'

01:11:02.467 --> 01:11:03.926
go get the meat!

01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:07.179
Get out the big skillet.

01:11:08.097 --> 01:11:10.432
I'll be in hell for breakfast.

01:11:11.267 --> 01:11:14.186
'Son of a bitch.'

01:11:35.666 --> 01:11:37.084
woo-wee!

01:11:41.005 --> 01:11:42.631
'Motherfucker!'

01:11:46.177 --> 01:11:47.219
come on, sweetheart.

01:11:48.554 --> 01:11:49.888
Let's see what you got.

01:11:50.431 --> 01:11:51.890
What the fuck is wrong
with you people?

01:11:52.308 --> 01:11:53.809
Why don't you leave us alone?

01:11:54.018 --> 01:11:56.186
- We're hungry.
- You ever heard of pizza?

01:11:58.898 --> 01:12:00.024
I like liver.

01:12:03.528 --> 01:12:04.570
And onions.

01:12:08.616 --> 01:12:12.453
And pain! And pain! And pain!

01:12:39.564 --> 01:12:41.274
- Come on!
- Whack, whack.

01:12:44.277 --> 01:12:45.236
Time for dinner!

01:12:47.238 --> 01:12:48.989
You're toast, fuck!

01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:16.266
Son of a bitch.

01:13:49.675 --> 01:13:51.426
Fuck! Come on.

01:14:51.529 --> 01:14:53.781
- 'Benny!'
- Aah!

01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:55.324
'Get him!'

01:14:59.912 --> 01:15:01.079
get him!

01:15:05.501 --> 01:15:07.377
Get him, Benny!

01:15:10.798 --> 01:15:12.341
'Get him, Benny!'

01:15:22.143 --> 01:15:23.269
yeah!

01:15:29.984 --> 01:15:31.402
Benny!

01:15:33.571 --> 01:15:35.990
- Take it!
- Ah!

01:15:36.198 --> 01:15:37.407
Yeah.

01:15:38.993 --> 01:15:40.619
'Yes!'

01:15:40.828 --> 01:15:42.704
'go! Benny!'

01:15:47.001 --> 01:15:48.502
'Benny.'

01:16:03.684 --> 01:16:05.811
Benny!

01:16:22.995 --> 01:16:24.621
No!

01:16:25.748 --> 01:16:26.832
No!

01:16:33.214 --> 01:16:37.468
Sorry, little guy.

01:16:38.761 --> 01:16:42.848
Sorry, little guy!

01:16:44.433 --> 01:16:47.394
Sorry, little guy!

01:18:01.135 --> 01:18:01.969
No.

01:18:03.304 --> 01:18:04.555
No. No.

01:18:04.763 --> 01:18:06.306
Hey, hey, it's me.

01:18:06.515 --> 01:18:08.016
'It's me. It's Benny.'

01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:11.186
let's get out of here.

01:18:11.395 --> 01:18:12.604
You..

01:18:13.898 --> 01:18:14.899
You made it!

01:18:15.107 --> 01:18:16.691
Of course, I made it.

01:18:16.901 --> 01:18:19.486
Hey, we-we made it.
We made it.

01:18:19.904 --> 01:18:21.739
Come on, let's get out of here.
Come on.

01:18:23.032 --> 01:18:24.158
Yeah.

01:18:24.366 --> 01:18:26.201
Okay. Okay.

01:18:35.794 --> 01:18:36.920
It's knock-knock time in lubbock

01:18:37.129 --> 01:18:38.213
and I'm back!

01:18:43.260 --> 01:18:45.470
'You steal daddy's car,
then you steal my car.'

01:18:45.679 --> 01:18:48.139
I'm gonna get you, cut you up.
You cheated on me.

01:18:48.349 --> 01:18:49.725
You had to go out
with four-eyes, huh?

01:18:51.393 --> 01:18:52.894
Old four-eyes, eh?

01:18:53.103 --> 01:18:54.979
You're two little heifer butts..

01:18:55.189 --> 01:18:56.398
Hey!

01:19:03.030 --> 01:19:04.740
Where are you? Huh?

01:19:04.949 --> 01:19:06.533
Where are you?

01:19:10.788 --> 01:19:12.581
You flirtin' more
and you enjoyin' it less.

01:19:12.915 --> 01:19:14.541
'That's what
they do in California.'

01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:16.334
I never been
with a California girl.

01:19:16.543 --> 01:19:18.545
I like that skin of yours.

01:19:19.922 --> 01:19:22.132
Hey, hey! Hey, hey, you fuck..

01:19:27.471 --> 01:19:29.389
I hate when this happens,
you know.

01:19:30.849 --> 01:19:32.475
Okay, okay, now.

01:19:32.685 --> 01:19:33.811
I guess this kills our chance

01:19:34.019 --> 01:19:35.311
for dinner
on Saturday night, huh?

01:19:35.521 --> 01:19:36.522
Shut up.

01:19:38.399 --> 01:19:40.025
What are the chances
of a brainless bitch like you

01:19:40.234 --> 01:19:42.402
knowing how to use
that thing, hmm?

01:19:43.946 --> 01:19:47.491
Pretty goddamn good,
you backwoods motherfucker!

01:20:12.474 --> 01:20:13.308
Ah.

01:20:22.735 --> 01:20:25.320
There's roadkill all over Texas.

01:20:25.821 --> 01:20:27.280
You got that right.

01:21:31.929 --> 01:21:33.388
