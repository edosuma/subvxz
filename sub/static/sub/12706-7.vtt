WEBVTT

00:01.334 --> 00:03.071
BUFFY:
 Parker's problem with intimacy
 turned out to be

00:03.104 --> 00:05.538
that he can't
 get enough of it.

00:05.573 --> 00:08.842
Previously on
Buffy the Vampire Slayer...

00:08.875 --> 00:10.977
Oh! Oh!
(groans)

00:11.010 --> 00:13.180
I'm sorry. I forgot my manners
in all the concussion.

00:13.214 --> 00:14.981
I'm Riley. I'm a T.A.

00:15.015 --> 00:16.350
I'll be helping
the professor out.

00:16.384 --> 00:19.719
I'm Professor Walsh, the
evil bitch monster of death.

00:19.753 --> 00:23.056
SPIKE:
'Cause the big bad is back,
and this time...

00:23.091 --> 00:26.025
(groaning)

00:34.268 --> 00:38.771
FORREST:
Women. Young,
nubile, exciting.

00:38.805 --> 00:41.075
Each one a mystery,
waiting to be unlocked.

00:42.375 --> 00:44.612
Think any of 'em
are going to show?

00:44.645 --> 00:47.914
'Cause the party will be
lame if we lack for hotties.

00:47.948 --> 00:50.917
Professor? You with me?

00:50.951 --> 00:52.953
No, I'm with this
large pile

00:52.985 --> 00:54.854
of ungraded papers,
due at 3:00.

00:54.887 --> 00:56.090
How are you gonna
learn anything

00:56.124 --> 00:57.357
if you keep doing
schoolwork?

00:57.390 --> 01:01.128
Oh... check her out.

01:01.161 --> 01:04.096
Is she hot,
or is she hot?

01:06.167 --> 01:07.801
She's Buffy.

01:07.834 --> 01:08.968
(gasps)

01:09.001 --> 01:12.239
FORREST:
Buffy? I like that.

01:12.272 --> 01:15.876
That girl's so hot,
she's Buffy.

01:15.909 --> 01:17.444
It's her name, Forrest.

01:17.478 --> 01:19.079
You've established
first contact?

01:19.112 --> 01:20.248
Excellent.

01:20.281 --> 01:22.049
What do you
think of her?

01:22.081 --> 01:25.218
You know, I never really thought
about what I think about her.

01:25.253 --> 01:27.155
A girl that cute in the face,
and you form no opinion?

01:27.188 --> 01:29.656
No, I mean...

01:29.689 --> 01:31.391
she's all right, I guess.

01:31.424 --> 01:33.460
She's just kind
of... I don't know.

01:33.493 --> 01:35.563
Peculiar.

01:35.596 --> 01:37.365
Peculiar?
Yeah.

01:41.301 --> 01:43.103
Hey, Graham.
Huh?

01:43.137 --> 01:44.737
What do you think
of the blonde chick?

01:44.771 --> 01:45.739
Mattressable,

01:45.772 --> 01:46.973
n'est-ce pas?

01:47.007 --> 01:48.408
Riley's not down.

01:48.442 --> 01:49.509
Doesn't like her.

01:49.543 --> 01:50.811
I don't dislike her.

01:50.843 --> 01:52.612
She just--
she never feels

01:52.646 --> 01:54.581
like she's really there
when you talk to her.

01:54.615 --> 01:56.183
I like girls I can
get a grip on.

01:56.216 --> 01:58.186
FORREST:
I bet you do.

01:58.218 --> 01:59.753
Not that way.

01:59.787 --> 02:02.489
Just a little less ready
for takeoff all the time.

02:02.522 --> 02:04.992
There's definitely
something off about her.

02:05.025 --> 02:06.793
Maybe she's
Canadian.

02:06.826 --> 02:08.429
FORREST:
Didn't she go with Parker Abrams

02:08.461 --> 02:11.098
for about 30 seconds?

02:11.131 --> 02:12.765
Yeah, there's
a sign of good taste.

02:12.800 --> 02:14.668
Okay, but you've got
to admit

02:14.701 --> 02:17.003
she's a major league hottie.

02:17.037 --> 02:18.972
Well, I'm not denying
she's easy on the eyes.

02:19.006 --> 02:21.008
I'm just saying...

02:22.376 --> 02:23.711
(grunts)

02:23.743 --> 02:25.812
Would you really
want to go out with her?

02:25.846 --> 02:26.947
Hell yes!

02:26.979 --> 02:28.681
I bet a lot of guys
would like

02:28.716 --> 02:30.651
to get their hands on her.

02:30.683 --> 02:32.686
Slayer...

02:34.054 --> 02:36.524
I'll kill you.

02:37.758 --> 02:39.727
Not so tough.

02:39.759 --> 02:43.497
I... kill the slayer.

03:15.929 --> 03:16.930
(screams)

03:32.211 --> 03:35.283
(wolf howling)

03:35.316 --> 03:37.418
*

04:25.632 --> 04:30.504
Hmm. Well, based on
Buffy's description,

04:30.538 --> 04:32.238
I believe the men
that we're after

04:32.271 --> 04:35.108
look something
like, um...

04:35.141 --> 04:36.209
like this.

04:39.278 --> 04:41.247
The latest in fall fascism.

04:41.281 --> 04:42.615
I like it.

04:42.649 --> 04:44.784
A bit full in the hips for
my taste, but...

04:44.817 --> 04:46.620
I think we can
safely assume they're human,

04:46.653 --> 04:49.956
so, um, no research needed.

04:49.990 --> 04:52.593
No studying? Damn!

04:52.625 --> 04:54.293
Next thing you'll tell me is
I'll have to eat jelly doughnuts

04:54.327 --> 04:56.797
or sleep with a supermodel
to get things done around here.

04:56.829 --> 04:59.098
I ask you,
how much can one man give?

04:59.132 --> 05:00.500
Not too much,
I'm afraid.

05:00.533 --> 05:02.603
Um, once again
I'd say that you and I

05:02.636 --> 05:05.939
will not be needed
to help Buffy.

05:05.973 --> 05:07.675
Really?

05:07.708 --> 05:08.776
Really.

05:08.809 --> 05:10.009
Well, how about this?

05:10.043 --> 05:11.345
We whip out the Ouija board,

05:11.379 --> 05:12.713
light a few candles,

05:12.745 --> 05:14.014
summon some ancient,
unstoppable evil.

05:14.047 --> 05:15.882
Mayhem, mayhem, mayhem.

05:15.915 --> 05:19.052
We show up and kick its ass.

05:23.391 --> 05:25.024
Wee bit unethical.

05:25.057 --> 05:26.560
BUFFY:
Hello, people.

05:26.593 --> 05:27.627
Hey.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.829
Hmm.

05:29.862 --> 05:30.831
It's my late night
storm trooper pal.

05:30.863 --> 05:32.298
It-It's just for reference,

05:32.331 --> 05:35.034
you know, but, uh,
fairly accurate, you'd say?

05:35.067 --> 05:36.202
That's your man.

05:36.235 --> 05:37.704
Your man, actually.

05:37.737 --> 05:39.172
Uh, you are patrolling tonight?

05:39.206 --> 05:42.308
Nope, I am going
to a party tonight.

05:42.341 --> 05:44.677
Hopefully, a "no fighting,
no biting" kind of deal.

05:44.711 --> 05:45.978
Buffy, somebody's got

05:46.012 --> 05:47.814
to find out
who these people are.

05:47.848 --> 05:50.683
Giles, I live in a dorm now.

05:50.718 --> 05:52.985
The girls in my hall
want to party,

05:53.019 --> 05:54.187
Willow needs some cheering up.

05:54.221 --> 05:55.488
I'm going to take her.

05:55.523 --> 05:56.656
XANDER:
How's Will dealing...?

05:56.689 --> 05:57.824
With the black hole
of despair

05:57.858 --> 06:01.728
she's been living in
since Oz left?

06:01.762 --> 06:03.764
She's dealing. I'm helping.

06:03.797 --> 06:06.333
It's hard. Ergo, party.

06:06.365 --> 06:07.334
You two can take patrol.

06:07.367 --> 06:08.668
Now, if you'll
excuse me,

06:08.701 --> 06:12.038
I need to go find something
slutty to wear tonight.

06:30.824 --> 06:32.560
(buzzing)

06:42.735 --> 06:44.704
MALE VOICE:
Don't drink it.

06:44.737 --> 06:46.906
It's drugged.

06:51.011 --> 06:53.880
Uh-huh.

06:53.913 --> 06:55.915
Who are you, mate?

06:55.949 --> 06:57.584
I'm a rat.

06:57.617 --> 07:00.521
I'm a lab rat, just
like the others.

07:01.788 --> 07:03.089
They're gonna kill us, you know.

07:03.122 --> 07:05.759
Well, how are they
gonna do that?

07:05.793 --> 07:07.560
Well, they starve you.

07:07.595 --> 07:08.961
When you're ready to
bite your own arm,

07:08.995 --> 07:12.264
they shoot out one
of those packets.

07:12.298 --> 07:16.704
You drink, and the next
thing, you're gone.

07:19.706 --> 07:21.475
And that's when they
do the experiments.

07:21.509 --> 07:23.110
And, uh, they are?

07:24.343 --> 07:26.278
The government? Nazis?

07:26.312 --> 07:28.247
A major cosmetics company?

07:28.281 --> 07:30.417
Who cares?

07:30.449 --> 07:32.519
All I know is, one minute
I'm running from the slayer,

07:32.552 --> 07:35.122
and the next thing,
I'm here.

07:35.154 --> 07:37.324
The slayer!

07:37.356 --> 07:39.425
I knew it! I knew it!

07:39.459 --> 07:40.827
Yeah, she took
apart my crew

07:40.860 --> 07:42.295
and led me straight
to these guys.

07:42.329 --> 07:43.730
She set me up, too.

07:46.332 --> 07:47.433
I always worried
what would happen

07:47.466 --> 07:49.536
when that bitch
got some funding.

07:49.569 --> 07:52.439
She's wised up a bit.
Fine!

07:52.471 --> 07:54.707
I'll take her apart.

07:57.310 --> 07:59.612
I don't care
how brilliant she is.

07:59.646 --> 08:02.815
Stupid pen.

08:04.216 --> 08:06.185
My notes!

08:06.218 --> 08:07.487
Ball points can be tricky.

08:07.521 --> 08:09.822
WALSH:
Some controversial results
as well.

08:09.856 --> 08:11.559
That's all for today.

08:11.591 --> 08:12.959
Don't forget reading chapters
eight through 11 for tomorrow.

08:12.992 --> 08:15.161
Riley.

08:15.194 --> 08:17.129
I notice you left off
a name today in roll call.

08:17.163 --> 08:20.466
Osborne,
Daniel Osbourne, Oz?

08:20.500 --> 08:23.302
He's not in
this class anymore.

08:23.336 --> 08:25.137
I hear
he dropped out.

08:25.172 --> 08:26.139
Oh, well, you heard
way wrong then.

08:26.173 --> 08:28.542
I mean, he's not gone.

08:28.576 --> 08:33.813
H-He left temporarily
to work out a few things.

08:33.846 --> 08:35.481
I know that sounds lame
in its vagueness,

08:35.514 --> 08:39.152
but I assure you,
Oz will be back.

08:39.186 --> 08:41.053
WALSH:
Not to my class, he won't.

08:43.123 --> 08:45.592
An educated guess.
You know the rules,

08:45.625 --> 08:47.527
you know I hate
exceptions,

08:47.561 --> 08:50.898
and yet somehow
you feel your exception
is exceptional.

08:50.931 --> 08:52.665
Oh, but...
It is. To you.

08:52.700 --> 08:54.835
But since
I'm neither

08:54.868 --> 08:56.102
a freshman nor
a narcissist,

08:56.135 --> 08:59.338
I have to consider
the whole class.

08:59.371 --> 09:01.774
If your friend
can't respect
my schedule,

09:01.808 --> 09:05.913
I think it's best
he not come back.

09:11.818 --> 09:14.254
You know, for someone who
teaches human behavior,

09:14.287 --> 09:17.725
you might try showing some.

09:17.758 --> 09:20.860
It's not my job
to coddle my students.

09:20.894 --> 09:23.730
You're right.
A human being in pain

09:23.764 --> 09:28.902
has nothing to do
with your job.

09:34.607 --> 09:36.243
I like her.

09:36.275 --> 09:38.278
Really?

09:40.013 --> 09:43.415
You don't think she's
a little peculiar?

09:45.152 --> 09:48.054
Here we go.
Gear for tonight.

09:48.087 --> 09:50.256
If some commando squads
are out there fully loaded,

09:50.289 --> 09:52.759
these babies might
give us the edge we'll need.

09:53.927 --> 09:56.062
That's a very impressive array.

09:56.096 --> 09:57.798
Where'd it all
come from?

09:57.831 --> 09:59.932
Uh, requisitioned it.

09:59.966 --> 10:03.436
Back when I was
military guy.

10:03.470 --> 10:06.840
That was two years ago.
You still 100%?

10:06.874 --> 10:10.778
Are you kidding? I put
the "semper" in "semper fi."

10:10.811 --> 10:12.578
I might not be able
to assemble

10:12.611 --> 10:14.480
an M16 blindfolded,
like I used to,

10:14.514 --> 10:18.217
or pass weapons drill
for the mobile infantry...

10:20.352 --> 10:22.188
Might as well face it.
Right now,

10:22.221 --> 10:23.490
I don't have
the technical skills

10:23.523 --> 10:24.658
to join the Swiss Army.

10:24.692 --> 10:26.927
And all those guys
ask you to do

10:26.960 --> 10:30.263
is uncork a couple
of sassy Cabernets.

10:30.297 --> 10:32.631
Well, I'm sure you'll be ready
when the time comes.

10:32.665 --> 10:36.469
Oh, fear not.
Hand to hand?
I'm still the man.

10:36.503 --> 10:37.937
Whoever these guys
trained with,

10:37.971 --> 10:40.106
I'm sure they're
not ready to deal with...

10:40.139 --> 10:41.607
WOMAN: Xander!

10:41.640 --> 10:43.143
Yes, Mom!

10:43.176 --> 10:45.312
I made a nice fruit punch
for you and your friend.

10:45.345 --> 10:48.315
Would you boys
like some?

10:49.481 --> 10:52.619
Is it, uh,
raspberry fruit punch?

10:52.652 --> 10:54.020
RILEY:
 So she says,

10:54.053 --> 10:56.623
"You teach human behavior.

10:56.655 --> 10:57.957
Maybe you ought
to show some."

10:57.990 --> 11:00.159
Oh, you're lying.
She says that to Walsh?

11:00.192 --> 11:01.394
Hope to die.

11:01.427 --> 11:02.495
Doesn't lack
for guts.

11:02.528 --> 11:03.663
You got
to give her that.

11:03.697 --> 11:05.231
Yeah, but she's nuts.

11:05.264 --> 11:07.134
Oh, come on. Like
you never wanted

11:07.167 --> 11:09.201
to tell
the professor off.
Hey, Parker!

11:09.235 --> 11:10.738
PARKER:
Forrest, what's up, man?

11:10.770 --> 11:12.572
Hey, man, what's the
scoop on Buffy Summers?

11:12.605 --> 11:14.073
Is she cool?

11:14.106 --> 11:16.543
Buffy? Yeah,
she's all right, I guess.

11:16.576 --> 11:17.977
I mean, kind of whiny.

11:18.010 --> 11:18.979
How's that?

11:19.011 --> 11:20.080
Well, you know, clingy.

11:20.113 --> 11:22.649
I mean, we got
a little physical--

11:22.682 --> 11:26.418
uh, well, fully physical--

11:26.452 --> 11:27.653
and then she's
all over me, you know,

11:27.687 --> 11:29.056
like we're betrothed
or something.

11:29.088 --> 11:31.591
No, but fun was had,
yeah?

11:31.624 --> 11:34.061
(laughs) Oh, yeah.

11:34.094 --> 11:36.328
The word is stamina.

11:36.363 --> 11:38.565
I mean, definitely
a bunny in the sack,

11:38.597 --> 11:41.668
but later on, well.

11:41.701 --> 11:42.870
You know the difference
between

11:42.903 --> 11:44.671
a freshman girl
and a toilet seat?

11:44.703 --> 11:48.040
A toilet seat doesn't follow
you around after you use it.

11:51.443 --> 11:52.678
I can't believe
that I did that.

11:52.711 --> 11:53.947
Welcome to the club.

11:53.980 --> 11:55.381
Do you have any idea
how much trouble

11:55.414 --> 11:56.415
you could have
gotten into?

11:56.448 --> 11:57.750
If Parker reported
you...

11:57.784 --> 11:59.251
He won't.
He's too embarrassed.

11:59.286 --> 12:00.620
I hit him.

12:00.653 --> 12:01.788
What the hell for?

12:01.822 --> 12:03.023
He-- he was just being so crude.

12:03.056 --> 12:04.924
Please.
You've heard me

12:04.957 --> 12:06.458
say much grosser
things than that.

12:06.493 --> 12:08.028
Yeah, and most of those
are about your own mother.

12:08.061 --> 12:10.129
(laughs)

12:10.163 --> 12:12.432
What is it?

12:15.434 --> 12:19.206
I just didn't like hearing him
talk about Buffy that way.

12:19.239 --> 12:21.240
I think I...

12:21.274 --> 12:23.643
Well, I guess I like her.

12:23.676 --> 12:26.745
You're kind of
like a moron.

12:26.779 --> 12:29.749
So, you... you knew
that I had feelings for her.

12:29.783 --> 12:32.585
Everybody knows, man.

12:32.619 --> 12:35.554
Oh, "she's peculiar"?
Dead giveaway, buddy.

12:35.587 --> 12:37.657
I'm always
the last to know.

12:37.690 --> 12:39.692
So, whatcha gonna do?

12:41.260 --> 12:44.030
Well, I guess I'm gonna
go see a girl.

13:13.860 --> 13:15.828
Sorry, can't stay.

13:15.863 --> 13:17.831
Got to go see a girl.

13:23.169 --> 13:25.172
(alarm blaring)

13:30.677 --> 13:33.379
(screams)

13:34.413 --> 13:36.349
Get the serum!

13:36.383 --> 13:38.217
Let me out!

13:38.250 --> 13:39.552
Bit busy right now.

13:39.586 --> 13:41.020
Look, I know where
the exit is.

13:41.053 --> 13:42.322
You spring me,
you're free.

13:42.355 --> 13:44.557
You don't,
you're dead.

13:50.429 --> 13:52.264
(growls)

13:56.937 --> 14:00.506
Hurry! Hurry!

14:02.674 --> 14:04.677
Come on.

14:06.212 --> 14:08.215
This way!

14:19.458 --> 14:21.227
New plan!
We split up.

14:21.260 --> 14:22.761
You go that way.

14:25.432 --> 14:27.934
* Break real easy

14:27.967 --> 14:32.038
* But it just
won't fall down... *

14:33.072 --> 14:35.107
(knock on door)

14:35.142 --> 14:37.476
Come in.

14:38.979 --> 14:41.614
Oh, Riley. Hi.

14:41.648 --> 14:43.682
Hi.
Gee, I hope I'm not

14:43.716 --> 14:46.552
interrupting anything
really depressing.

14:47.553 --> 14:49.788
(turns off music)

14:49.822 --> 14:51.390
What's up?

14:53.625 --> 14:55.628
Right to the point, okay.

14:59.499 --> 15:02.534
I was thinking
of asking out Buffy.

15:02.568 --> 15:04.471
She's not here.

15:04.504 --> 15:06.572
I know. See,

15:06.605 --> 15:08.307
I don't know that
much about Buffy.

15:08.341 --> 15:09.708
But I'm interested
in what she likes,

15:09.741 --> 15:12.980
and so far, well,

15:13.013 --> 15:16.883
the only thing
that I know she likes is you.

15:16.916 --> 15:20.552
What-- what do you want me
to do?

15:20.586 --> 15:22.554
Just tell me something.

15:22.588 --> 15:24.091
Anything.

15:24.124 --> 15:25.591
Just give me a clue to...

15:25.625 --> 15:27.995
Here, let me help you
with that.

15:28.028 --> 15:30.096
Just something that will
start us talking, you know?

15:30.129 --> 15:33.000
I'm thinking that
"How 'bout them Broncos?"

15:33.033 --> 15:35.001
won't really cut it.

15:37.136 --> 15:39.505
Okay, say that I help,

15:39.538 --> 15:41.173
and you start a conversation,

15:41.207 --> 15:43.009
it goes great.

15:43.043 --> 15:45.511
You like Buffy.
She likes you.

15:45.544 --> 15:48.947
You spend time together,
feelings grow deeper,

15:48.981 --> 15:51.518
and one day,
without even realizing it,

15:51.551 --> 15:54.953
you find you're in love.
Time stops,

15:54.988 --> 15:56.755
and it feels
like the whole world's

15:56.788 --> 15:59.326
made for you two,
and you two alone,

15:59.359 --> 16:01.427
until the day one of you leaves

16:01.461 --> 16:03.796
and rips the still-beating heart
from the other,

16:03.830 --> 16:07.966
who's now a broken, hollow
mockery of the human condition.

16:10.302 --> 16:12.538
Yep, that's the plan.

16:12.572 --> 16:14.941
I figured it was.

16:14.974 --> 16:16.442
Look, if you
want to tell me

16:16.475 --> 16:18.878
to go to hell,
that's okay.

16:18.911 --> 16:20.147
Maybe this is
the last thing

16:20.179 --> 16:21.681
you want
to talk about.

16:21.713 --> 16:24.551
I just feel that, well,

16:24.583 --> 16:26.485
I've never courted anyone
like Buffy before.

16:26.519 --> 16:30.289
I don't think I've ever met
anyone like Buffy before.

16:30.322 --> 16:32.792
Why should I trust you?

16:32.825 --> 16:35.461
Just sort of hoping you'd think

16:35.495 --> 16:37.529
I have an honest face.

16:37.563 --> 16:40.667
I've seen honest faces before.

16:40.700 --> 16:43.403
They usually come attached
to liars.

16:44.671 --> 16:46.605
All right.

16:48.107 --> 16:51.411
I guess I'm not gonna win here.

16:51.443 --> 16:53.546
And I appreciate you wanting
to protect your friend.

16:55.081 --> 16:58.918
I guess, uh, she kind of
brings that out in people.

17:02.955 --> 17:04.522
She likes cheese.

17:04.557 --> 17:07.394
What?

17:07.425 --> 17:10.096
Well, I'm not saying
it's the key to her heart,

17:10.130 --> 17:14.733
but Buffy...
she likes cheese.

17:14.767 --> 17:16.736
That's a start.

17:18.037 --> 17:21.272
She has a stuffed piggy
named Mr. Gordo,

17:21.307 --> 17:24.344
loves Ice Capades
without the irony,

17:24.376 --> 17:26.011
and she's dragging me
to this party

17:26.045 --> 17:29.082
tonight at Lowell House.

17:29.115 --> 17:31.351
Oh, you're going?
That's my house. I live there.

17:31.384 --> 17:34.621
Well, it'll give you
a chance to interact.

17:34.653 --> 17:36.522
But don't get fresh.

17:36.556 --> 17:39.791
Fresh? I don't even know
if we'd like each other yet.

17:43.430 --> 17:46.633
Hey, does she ever talk
about me?

17:46.665 --> 17:48.134
Like, has she ever said any...

17:48.167 --> 17:50.302
Sorry.

17:50.336 --> 17:52.771
That's discouraging.

17:52.805 --> 17:55.708
Still, I feel like
I have a fighting chance

17:55.741 --> 17:57.609
with my new accomplice.

17:57.644 --> 17:59.412
I'm not your accomplice.

17:59.445 --> 18:00.579
No, no. Of course not.

18:00.613 --> 18:02.315
I'm not.
You're not.

18:02.348 --> 18:04.217
We're clear.
We're clear.

18:04.250 --> 18:07.086
(pop music playing)

18:14.326 --> 18:16.596
Spike?

18:18.131 --> 18:19.965
Spike, is that really you?

18:19.999 --> 18:21.233
It's me, baby.

18:21.268 --> 18:24.304
Your man is... back.

18:24.336 --> 18:27.640
Bastard. You dumped me
and staked me

18:27.673 --> 18:29.075
and hurt me and left me...

18:29.107 --> 18:31.243
I know, sugar,
but you're forgetting

18:31.278 --> 18:35.080
one other thing I did.
I missed you.

18:35.114 --> 18:37.616
Really?

18:40.552 --> 18:43.955
Oh! Just don't ever do that
to me again.

18:43.990 --> 18:45.291
Oh, never!

18:45.325 --> 18:47.527
My little... foam latte.

18:47.559 --> 18:49.127
Your Blondie Bear
is here to stay.

18:49.162 --> 18:50.430
Well, where have
you been?

18:50.462 --> 18:51.763
No, wait. Don't tell me.

18:51.798 --> 18:53.098
I'm just glad you're back.

18:53.132 --> 18:55.602
And this time,
it's for good, right?

18:55.634 --> 18:58.971
Oh, forever and ever,
mon petite creme brulee.

18:59.005 --> 19:00.707
Ooh. Italian.

19:00.740 --> 19:03.942
Uh, yeah,
and get used to it.

19:03.976 --> 19:05.944
Big daddy's home.

19:05.978 --> 19:07.846
We're gonna go
wherever you want,

19:07.880 --> 19:09.781
do whatever you want,

19:09.816 --> 19:11.951
kill whoever you want.

19:11.983 --> 19:14.520
Starting with the slayer.

19:14.554 --> 19:16.055
And after that,

19:16.087 --> 19:18.557
it's all you and me,

19:18.590 --> 19:20.727
my little...

19:20.759 --> 19:23.529
mentholated pack of smokes.

19:23.563 --> 19:26.732
Spikey. Let's leave
the slayer alone.

19:26.766 --> 19:29.134
You know she'll only
slap you around.

19:29.167 --> 19:30.369
And I can do that.

19:30.403 --> 19:31.804
Ow! Uh, no, see, ow.

19:31.837 --> 19:33.640
The head, love.
Watch the head.

19:33.673 --> 19:35.208
Whoa, watch it!

19:35.241 --> 19:37.676
XANDER: Every man
 faces this moment.

19:37.710 --> 19:41.180
Here. Now. Watching, waiting,

19:41.213 --> 19:43.982
for an unseen enemy
that has no face.

19:44.016 --> 19:47.019
Nerve endings
screaming in silence.

19:47.052 --> 19:49.588
Never knowing which thought
might be your last.

19:49.622 --> 19:52.525
Oh, shut up.

19:52.558 --> 19:54.192
* Rock y'all,
don't stop, y'all *

19:54.227 --> 19:56.762
* To the beat, y'all,
your body rock, y'all *

19:56.796 --> 19:58.565
* Rock y'all,
don't stop, y'all *

19:58.597 --> 20:00.532
* To the beat, y'all,
your body rock, y'all *

20:03.369 --> 20:04.436
Looks cool.

20:04.471 --> 20:06.038
Uh-huh.

20:08.907 --> 20:11.109
Look, we could go.

20:11.143 --> 20:12.211
No, no!

20:12.244 --> 20:15.515
We're here for fun.

20:15.548 --> 20:18.550
Oh, look. Some of the guys
are here already.

20:18.585 --> 20:20.086
I'm gonna grab a soda.

20:20.118 --> 20:21.887
I'll-I'll find you guys.

20:23.088 --> 20:25.424
Okay.

20:36.935 --> 20:38.104
Okay, she's wearing

20:38.136 --> 20:39.905
the halter top
with sensible shoes.

20:39.939 --> 20:41.473
That means mostly dancing,
light contact,

20:41.508 --> 20:42.808
But don't push your luck.

20:42.842 --> 20:44.576
Heavy conversation's
out of the question.

20:44.611 --> 20:47.046
So what do I do?

20:47.078 --> 20:48.615
Ask her to dance.

20:48.647 --> 20:52.250
Right. Dance.

20:52.285 --> 20:53.385
Wait.

20:53.420 --> 20:54.787
No.

20:54.820 --> 20:56.655
What's the matter?

20:56.689 --> 20:58.557
I can't dance.

20:58.590 --> 21:00.393
Then talk.

21:00.426 --> 21:01.760
Keep eye contact.

21:01.794 --> 21:03.261
Funny is good,
but don't be glib.

21:03.296 --> 21:04.431
And remember,

21:04.463 --> 21:05.731
if you hurt her,

21:05.765 --> 21:07.266
I will beat you to death
with a shovel.

21:08.166 --> 21:09.635
A vague disclaimer

21:09.669 --> 21:11.069
is nobody's friend.

21:11.103 --> 21:12.805
Have fun.

21:24.282 --> 21:25.451
Excuse me.

21:28.186 --> 21:29.255
Hi.

21:29.288 --> 21:30.390
Hi.

21:32.858 --> 21:34.493
Um, Buffy...

21:37.063 --> 21:39.131
Uh...

21:40.532 --> 21:42.602
You do the reading
on, uh, chapter nine?

21:42.634 --> 21:44.336
Uh-huh.

21:44.371 --> 21:47.073
Wow. Some theories, huh?

21:50.009 --> 21:52.243
Cheese?

21:56.548 --> 21:57.549
Fine. Let's split up.

21:57.584 --> 22:00.653
I don't care.

22:00.686 --> 22:02.020
(clattering)

22:19.705 --> 22:21.339
Harmony.

22:21.374 --> 22:23.476
Xander?

22:23.509 --> 22:24.676
That's close enough.

22:24.711 --> 22:26.878
I'm warning you--
I've been highly trained

22:26.913 --> 22:29.048
to put this through your heart.

22:29.080 --> 22:32.218
No mercy, no warning.

22:32.250 --> 22:34.721
I can kill you
where you stand.

22:34.753 --> 22:37.022
Bring it on, then.

22:41.427 --> 22:42.662
Ow!

22:42.694 --> 22:44.730
Ow!

22:44.763 --> 22:46.532
You sissy kicker!

22:51.738 --> 22:53.038
Get away!

23:03.915 --> 23:05.351
Cut it out!

23:05.384 --> 23:07.886
Oh, I'm so gonna bite you!

23:07.920 --> 23:09.788
Ow... okay, stop, stop!

23:09.821 --> 23:11.222
We should stop, okay?

23:11.257 --> 23:12.424
Okay, I will if you will.

23:12.459 --> 23:14.125
On the count
of three...

23:14.160 --> 23:15.361
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

23:15.394 --> 23:18.297
One... two...

23:18.329 --> 23:19.766
three!

23:23.769 --> 23:26.071
Right, okay.

23:26.105 --> 23:28.575
Harmony, it's been
great catching up.

23:28.607 --> 23:30.308
Really, I'm just gonna pick up

23:30.342 --> 23:32.411
the tattered shreds
of my dignity and go home.

23:32.444 --> 23:33.613
Leaving you

23:33.645 --> 23:36.382
with your fire.

23:36.414 --> 23:37.817
My fire?

23:37.849 --> 23:39.885
Yeah, right.

23:39.919 --> 23:41.953
Like I'd listen
to the Sex Pistols.

23:41.988 --> 23:43.288
Ew.

23:43.322 --> 23:45.625
This crap belongs to Spike.

23:45.657 --> 23:47.759
Spike?

23:47.794 --> 23:49.895
(scoffs)
Can you believe him?

23:49.929 --> 23:52.397
He comes back
with all these big promises,

23:52.431 --> 23:55.134
not that I believed him,
you know.

23:55.166 --> 23:57.103
But he could have
spent one night, but, no.

23:57.135 --> 23:58.904
Everything was "slayer this"
and "slayer that."

23:58.938 --> 24:01.740
I mean, he probably
already killed her.

24:01.773 --> 24:03.174
I'm not taking him back,

24:03.209 --> 24:04.943
I just... I just
want to know why it is

24:04.977 --> 24:06.345
that men always...

24:07.513 --> 24:10.281
...leave.

24:10.316 --> 24:11.450
(sighs)

24:13.553 --> 24:15.521
* I was blind

24:15.555 --> 24:17.022
* As a bat

24:17.056 --> 24:18.825
* And still knew

24:18.857 --> 24:20.425
* Where you were at

24:20.459 --> 24:22.361
* I was deaf...

24:22.394 --> 24:24.363
I can't believe it.

24:24.395 --> 24:25.364
I choked.

24:25.396 --> 24:28.535
You really, really did.

24:28.567 --> 24:30.936
You don't understand.
I'm good at things.

24:30.970 --> 24:32.638
That's what I do.

24:32.672 --> 24:35.974
Work hard, apply myself,
get it done.

24:36.008 --> 24:38.277
Well, you failed
extremely well.

24:38.309 --> 24:40.211
That's a great
comfort to me.

24:43.214 --> 24:44.983
You need to relax.

24:45.017 --> 24:47.318
I mean,
you're not proposing.

24:47.353 --> 24:49.055
You're just making contact,

24:49.087 --> 24:50.522
getting a reaction.

24:50.557 --> 24:52.558
Any reaction is okay,

24:52.592 --> 24:54.794
except projectile vomiting.

24:54.826 --> 24:56.895
But, (chuckles) what are
the chances of that?

24:56.929 --> 25:00.231
(Dingoes song plays)

25:00.266 --> 25:01.968
Are you okay?

25:02.000 --> 25:04.537
This song...

25:04.570 --> 25:06.638
Oh, yeah, it's a tape
of some bands

25:06.673 --> 25:08.740
from last year's party.

25:08.775 --> 25:10.375
Associations?

25:10.409 --> 25:11.943
Big.

25:13.179 --> 25:15.413
Bad?

25:18.084 --> 25:20.019
A.J.!

25:21.688 --> 25:24.891
(song stops, crowd groaning)

25:24.923 --> 25:26.726
Thank you.

25:26.759 --> 25:29.428
Now, go find Buffy.

25:29.461 --> 25:30.997
There's no hurry.

25:31.029 --> 25:32.498
I mean, if you want to talk.

25:32.530 --> 25:35.401
No, I-I want you
to find Buffy

25:35.433 --> 25:36.769
and tell her
that I went home

25:36.802 --> 25:38.671
and not to worry
about me.

25:38.704 --> 25:41.339
Which at least will give you
something to say.

25:41.373 --> 25:43.675
(chuckles)

25:43.710 --> 25:45.845
Thanks.

25:45.877 --> 25:47.947
You'll do fine.

25:47.980 --> 25:50.148
Yeah. (sighs)

25:56.454 --> 25:57.589
(softly): Hey.

25:57.624 --> 25:59.525
Hey.

25:59.557 --> 26:00.692
Um...

26:00.727 --> 26:01.693
Willow said to say

26:01.728 --> 26:03.229
that she took off.

26:03.261 --> 26:05.530
Oh, she's okay.

26:05.564 --> 26:08.067
Kind of blue,
but she said not to worry.

26:08.099 --> 26:09.602
Thank you.

26:11.269 --> 26:13.905
You know, I wanted to ask
you something.

26:13.940 --> 26:15.374
Ask away.

26:15.406 --> 26:17.710
Buffy! I've been
looking all over for you.

26:17.743 --> 26:20.078
We need...

26:20.112 --> 26:22.413
Need to talk,
uh, not here.

26:22.448 --> 26:25.617
It's sort of...
unfinished business.

26:25.652 --> 26:27.619
Business? Right.

26:27.653 --> 26:29.255
Uh, excuse us?

26:29.288 --> 26:31.790
No problem.

26:33.459 --> 26:35.594
Denied.

26:35.627 --> 26:38.497
(scoffs) It's not like
she blew me off.

26:38.529 --> 26:40.566
She just left
with another guy, that's all.

26:40.598 --> 26:43.001
We need you downstairs, anyway.

26:46.939 --> 26:48.807
You know I hate to say it,
but they're probably

26:48.840 --> 26:50.676
on their way to make
crazy naked sex.

26:50.710 --> 26:52.177
Is that necessary?

26:52.211 --> 26:54.180
Look, I'm protecting you,
buddy.

26:54.212 --> 26:55.847
I don't want to see you mooning
over some freshman

26:55.882 --> 26:57.148
for the next three months.

26:57.182 --> 26:58.616
COMPUTER:
Retinal scan accepted.

26:58.651 --> 27:00.686
I like her.
I'm on your side here.

27:00.720 --> 27:01.953
I know you are,
Graham.

27:01.988 --> 27:05.523
That's what gives me
the strength

27:05.557 --> 27:07.727
to put up with
this comedian.

27:12.131 --> 27:13.665
Dude, straight tip:

27:13.700 --> 27:15.134
I know about girls.

27:15.166 --> 27:17.269
Exactly! Girls, plural.

27:17.303 --> 27:18.938
I'm talking about one girl.

27:18.971 --> 27:21.272
One girl.

27:21.307 --> 27:23.942
COMPUTER: Initiative vocal code
match complete.

27:23.976 --> 27:26.377
Special agent Finn, Riley.

27:26.412 --> 27:29.115
The problem is,

27:29.147 --> 27:31.817
what kind of girl is
gonna go out with a guy

27:31.851 --> 27:34.787
who's acting
all Joe Regular by day

27:34.820 --> 27:37.723
and then turns
all demon-hunter by night?

27:37.757 --> 27:40.358
GRAHAM:
Maybe a peculiar one.

27:40.392 --> 27:41.827
Thank you, Graham.

27:41.861 --> 27:43.796
FORREST: Oh, sure.
Give him the gratitude

27:43.829 --> 27:46.231
when I'm the guy sparing
you a heartbreak.

28:03.249 --> 28:04.717
GRAHAM:
She's a major babe.

28:04.750 --> 28:06.551
I still say you got
a shot, Ri.

28:06.585 --> 28:08.319
You see, Forrest?

28:08.354 --> 28:10.521
You don't have to be
so negative all the time.

28:10.556 --> 28:12.691
Hold up.

28:12.724 --> 28:15.361
Situation?

28:15.394 --> 28:17.096
Gentlemen, suit up.

28:17.128 --> 28:18.329
We have a code red.

28:18.364 --> 28:20.432
Hostile 17

28:20.465 --> 28:21.867
has escaped.

28:28.240 --> 28:29.776
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Hostile containment team...

28:29.808 --> 28:31.542
WALSH: Here's what we know,
and it isn't much.

28:31.576 --> 28:34.346
Hostile 17 broke restraints
at exactly 2:47 p.m.

28:34.380 --> 28:35.614
That's a big head start.

28:35.646 --> 28:38.084
Gets bigger every time
you interrupt me.

28:38.116 --> 28:39.417
It was bagged
and tagged locally,

28:39.451 --> 28:40.952
so assume
it knows the area.

28:40.987 --> 28:42.922
The creature has
every advantage right now.

28:42.954 --> 28:45.924
Fail to recapture it, and
everything we've worked for--

28:45.958 --> 28:48.626
the Initiative itself--
could end tonight.

28:48.660 --> 28:50.195
Nobody's failing
on my watch.
Glad to hear it.

28:50.229 --> 28:52.431
(indistinct P.A. announcements)

29:02.808 --> 29:06.278
Gentlemen, Agent Finn is now
in charge of this operation.

29:06.311 --> 29:08.815
I'm counting on you, Riley.

29:08.847 --> 29:11.549
We start with the basic
mobilization pattern.

29:11.583 --> 29:13.952
Three teams. Sweep and search,
just like practice.

29:13.986 --> 29:15.287
Thorough but fast.

29:15.320 --> 29:16.923
C-team:
take the campus perimeter.

29:16.955 --> 29:18.656
Make sure it can't leave.

29:18.690 --> 29:20.826
Stake it if you gotta,
but only as a last resort.

29:20.859 --> 29:22.795
B-team: you're going down.

29:22.828 --> 29:24.496
Tunnels, sewers, cemeteries.

29:24.529 --> 29:26.265
Gates and Miller are with me.

29:26.298 --> 29:28.166
We take the heart of campus
and work our way out.

29:28.200 --> 29:30.936
All units, maintain radio
contact early and often.

29:30.970 --> 29:32.637
Who's got questions?

29:34.705 --> 29:36.474
Move.

29:56.895 --> 29:59.164
BUFFY:
 What is wrong with him?

29:59.198 --> 30:01.599
Doesn't Spike get that
this is my town?

30:01.633 --> 30:02.667
He's resilient.

30:02.701 --> 30:04.269
And it's my night off.

30:04.303 --> 30:06.005
I'm sure he'd pick
another night

30:06.038 --> 30:08.807
if he knew you were busy
with Teutonic boy-toy.

30:08.840 --> 30:10.009
What is that supposed to mean?

30:10.041 --> 30:11.343
Nothing.

30:11.376 --> 30:14.279
Riley's a doof.
He's not Teutonic.

30:14.313 --> 30:16.115
GILES: We have to assume
that Spike's main target

30:16.147 --> 30:17.548
is you, Buffy.

30:17.583 --> 30:19.518
Fine. You know what?
He's worn out his welcome.

30:19.550 --> 30:21.119
Tonight, I kill him.

30:21.153 --> 30:22.020
You have a plan?

30:22.054 --> 30:23.788
I am the plan.

30:23.821 --> 30:25.691
If Spike wants me,
I go alone...

30:25.723 --> 30:27.393
no arguments.

30:27.425 --> 30:29.528
Lead him away
from the popular places

30:29.560 --> 30:31.998
and give him what he wants.

30:32.030 --> 30:34.866
Oh, wait, wait!

30:34.901 --> 30:35.968
Take this.

30:36.001 --> 30:37.202
A flare gun?

30:37.236 --> 30:39.538
Xander, if I find Spike,
I'm staking him,

30:39.570 --> 30:41.073
not signaling ships at sea.

30:41.106 --> 30:42.773
You get into trouble...

30:43.942 --> 30:45.676
Okay.

30:45.711 --> 30:47.578
I'll flare.

30:47.613 --> 30:48.948
And we'll come a-runnin'.

30:50.682 --> 30:52.018
(door opens)

30:52.050 --> 30:54.420
(door closes)

30:54.452 --> 30:55.854
Do you think
Spike'll find her?

30:55.887 --> 30:59.090
I'm sure of it.

30:59.125 --> 31:01.559
(computer beeping)

31:21.880 --> 31:24.415
Hello, gorgeous.

31:37.229 --> 31:39.198
What've we got?

31:39.230 --> 31:41.599
Civilian, sir.

31:47.306 --> 31:49.641
Oh, damn.

31:49.674 --> 31:50.875
She's compromising the area.

31:50.909 --> 31:54.279
At least she's not
making crazy, naked sex.

31:54.313 --> 31:55.814
Told you.

31:55.846 --> 31:58.650
We got to clear her
out of there fast.

31:58.683 --> 32:00.486
Maybe not.

32:00.519 --> 32:02.421
Just thinking.

32:02.453 --> 32:03.888
If you were hostile 17,

32:03.922 --> 32:05.590
living off the crap
we feed 'em,

32:05.624 --> 32:07.893
what would you
rather eat than that?

32:07.925 --> 32:10.328
You want to use the girl
I got a crush on as bait?

32:10.362 --> 32:11.896
I can tag a hostile
at 50 yards.

32:11.930 --> 32:14.133
Denied.

32:14.165 --> 32:15.233
She'd be safe the entire...

32:15.267 --> 32:16.934
I said denied, Agent.

32:16.969 --> 32:18.636
Did you just pull rank on me?

32:18.670 --> 32:21.140
Do you have
a problem with that?

32:22.508 --> 32:24.643
No, sir.

32:24.675 --> 32:27.645
So, how are we gonna
get her out of there?

32:36.355 --> 32:37.788
Riley!

32:37.823 --> 32:39.924
What are you doing here?

32:39.958 --> 32:42.294
Well, I didn't get a chance
to say good-bye to you

32:42.327 --> 32:44.563
after the party.
You left so fast.

32:46.531 --> 32:48.334
You know, with your friend...

32:48.366 --> 32:50.001
who's a boy.

32:50.036 --> 32:51.936
Oh, Xander?

32:51.970 --> 32:55.507
He's not anyone that I...
want to talk about right now.

32:55.540 --> 32:57.209
Um...

32:57.242 --> 32:59.944
You know, I don't want you
taking this the wrong way.

32:59.978 --> 33:01.113
It's just, um...

33:01.146 --> 33:03.115
I need a little
alone time now...

33:03.148 --> 33:05.683
alone.

33:05.717 --> 33:07.519
Why?

33:07.553 --> 33:08.720
I need space.

33:08.753 --> 33:09.555
We're outdoors.

33:09.587 --> 33:11.390
Emotionally.

33:11.423 --> 33:12.723
I mean, emotionally...

33:12.758 --> 33:14.125
You know,

33:14.160 --> 33:15.894
there's plenty of space
back in your room.

33:15.926 --> 33:17.363
Why don't I take you?

33:17.395 --> 33:18.963
You wouldn't believe
the weirdos out at this hour.

33:18.997 --> 33:20.566
Whoa! Okay...

33:20.598 --> 33:22.233
Uh, it's a free campus.

33:22.268 --> 33:24.569
Who died and made you
John Wayne?

33:24.603 --> 33:26.204
(sighs)
I'm just trying to help.

33:26.238 --> 33:27.573
You think I need help?

33:27.605 --> 33:29.174
Believe me, I don't.

33:29.208 --> 33:30.741
You know, if you were

33:30.776 --> 33:34.546
a real gentleman,
then you would just leave.

33:34.579 --> 33:36.382
You would go
far, far away, now.

33:36.414 --> 33:37.982
Shoo!
Are you drunk?

33:38.016 --> 33:40.486
Yes! Go and report me.
I'm taking you home. Come on.

33:40.519 --> 33:42.721
Oh, did you ever think maybe
I'm gonna take you home, huh?

33:43.855 --> 33:46.192
What? You think that-that

33:46.224 --> 33:48.660
boys can take care of themselves
and girls need help?

33:48.693 --> 33:50.662
Yeah.

33:50.695 --> 33:52.663
That is so Teutonic.
Look, Buffy,

33:52.698 --> 33:55.000
as long as you're out here,
I'm staying.

33:55.032 --> 33:57.435
Well, as long as
you're out here, I'm staying.

33:57.469 --> 33:58.703
(woman screams)

33:58.737 --> 34:00.872
I gotta go.
See ya!

34:02.473 --> 34:03.608
Tell me we're tracking.

34:03.642 --> 34:05.243
Honing a signal.

34:05.277 --> 34:07.045
(beeping)
Got it, heading west.

34:07.078 --> 34:08.847
That better be
the hostile.

34:08.880 --> 34:11.681
FORREST: All units converge,
all units converge.

34:11.717 --> 34:12.784
Hard target sighted.

34:12.818 --> 34:15.621
Heading one, two,
alpha niner.

34:15.652 --> 34:18.324
Let's bag it
before this gets ugly.

34:19.556 --> 34:22.893
(knocking)

34:22.927 --> 34:23.929
Come in.

34:26.731 --> 34:28.567
(gasps)

34:28.599 --> 34:29.635
Spike!

34:29.668 --> 34:31.637
U-Uh, what do you
you want?

34:31.670 --> 34:33.572
Uh, a spell?

34:33.605 --> 34:38.543
I-I can do that.

34:38.577 --> 34:41.646
(screams)

34:45.083 --> 34:47.518
I'll give you a choice.

34:48.619 --> 34:49.721
Now I'm gonna kill you.

34:49.755 --> 34:53.492
No choice in that.

34:53.525 --> 34:55.427
But...

34:55.460 --> 34:58.597
I can let you
stay dead...

34:58.630 --> 34:59.797
or...

34:59.831 --> 35:03.802
bring you back to be like me.

35:03.835 --> 35:06.172
I-I'll scream.

35:06.204 --> 35:08.239
(chuckles) Bonus.

35:08.273 --> 35:09.940
(screams)

35:09.974 --> 35:11.076
(grunting)

35:11.108 --> 35:13.978
* And if you're worn down

35:14.012 --> 35:17.349
* Well, you ought to be

35:17.382 --> 35:18.483
No!

35:18.516 --> 35:20.786
* Come on,
let's leave this town *

35:20.818 --> 35:23.021
* Run home

35:23.054 --> 35:25.590
* Run with me...
(growling)

35:25.623 --> 35:26.824
(screams)

35:43.409 --> 35:46.211
I don't understand.

35:46.244 --> 35:48.980
This sort of thing's
never happened to me before.

35:52.083 --> 35:53.385
Maybe you were nervous.

35:53.418 --> 35:56.121
I felt all right
when we started.

35:56.153 --> 35:57.322
(sighs)

35:57.356 --> 35:58.556
Let's try again.

35:58.590 --> 36:00.559
(snarling)

36:00.592 --> 36:01.827
Ow!

36:01.860 --> 36:02.893
Oh!

36:06.498 --> 36:08.367
(snarling)

36:08.400 --> 36:10.034
Ow!

36:10.068 --> 36:12.137
(muttering)

36:12.170 --> 36:14.005
Damn it!

36:20.579 --> 36:23.382
Maybe you're trying too hard.

36:25.951 --> 36:28.186
Doesn't this happen
to every vampire?

36:28.219 --> 36:29.755
Not to me, it doesn't.

36:37.094 --> 36:39.164
It's me, isn't it?

36:39.197 --> 36:41.266
What are you talking about?

36:41.300 --> 36:45.336
Well, you came looking
for Buffy and settled.

36:45.371 --> 36:48.606
I-I... You didn't want
to bite me.

36:48.639 --> 36:50.409
I just happened to
be around.

36:50.442 --> 36:52.911
Piffle!

36:52.943 --> 36:54.880
I know I'm not
the kind of girl

36:54.913 --> 36:57.416
vamps like to sink
their teeth into.

36:57.449 --> 37:00.117
It's always like,

37:00.150 --> 37:01.420
"Ooh, you're like
a sister to me,"

37:01.452 --> 37:03.422
or, "Oh, you're such
a good friend."

37:03.454 --> 37:04.623
Don't be ridiculous.

37:06.592 --> 37:09.728
I'd bite you
in a heartbeat.

37:12.063 --> 37:13.197
Really?

37:13.231 --> 37:15.567
Thought about it.

37:15.601 --> 37:17.436
When?

37:19.505 --> 37:21.106
Remember last year?

37:21.139 --> 37:24.309
You had on that,
uh, fuzzy pink number

37:24.342 --> 37:27.445
with the lilac underneath?

37:27.478 --> 37:29.079
(chuckles)

37:29.114 --> 37:31.282
I never would have guessed.

37:31.317 --> 37:33.585
You played the blood
lust kind of cool.

37:33.619 --> 37:35.387
Mmm. I hate being obvious.

37:35.420 --> 37:37.222
All fang-y and "Rrrr!"

37:37.255 --> 37:39.990
Takes the mystery out.

37:41.192 --> 37:43.829
But if you could...

37:43.862 --> 37:45.597
If I could, yeah.

37:47.465 --> 37:50.101
You know, this doesn't make you
any less terrifying.

37:50.135 --> 37:51.135
(sighs)

37:51.168 --> 37:53.271
Don't patronize me.

37:55.806 --> 37:57.443
I'm getting a picture.

37:57.476 --> 37:59.277
Signature's locked.

37:59.311 --> 38:00.277
What've we got?

38:00.311 --> 38:02.179
Humans of
the freshman variety.

38:02.213 --> 38:06.518
98.6, 98.6.

38:06.552 --> 38:07.652
Bingo.

38:07.686 --> 38:09.420
Got a cold one.
Thermal output clocking in

38:09.454 --> 38:11.021
at exactly room temperature.

38:11.056 --> 38:13.257
Vampire.

38:13.291 --> 38:14.860
Call in a standard
triangle flanking maneuver.

38:14.893 --> 38:16.126
We're going in.

38:17.663 --> 38:20.130
I need a lockdown on grid six.

38:21.733 --> 38:24.702
I'm only 126.

38:24.735 --> 38:28.172
You're being too hard
on yourself.

38:28.206 --> 38:30.842
Why don't we wait
a half an hour and try again?

38:33.411 --> 38:35.646
Or...

38:39.684 --> 38:41.318
(doors locking)

38:44.054 --> 38:44.922
Hey, hey, watch it!

38:53.097 --> 38:56.300
(crowd murmuring)

38:56.333 --> 38:58.068
Go, go!
Come on!

38:58.103 --> 38:59.704
(student screams)

39:11.048 --> 39:12.518
(grunting)

39:14.753 --> 39:16.153
RILEY:
No, hold your fire!

39:16.186 --> 39:18.255
(grunting)

39:20.626 --> 39:22.360
GRAHAM: It's on me!

39:22.393 --> 39:23.961
(screaming)

39:26.898 --> 39:30.201
Ow! My head! Ow!

39:35.273 --> 39:37.375
RILEY: Bag and tag it.
We're gone.

39:39.811 --> 39:40.911
FORREST: Sir...

39:40.945 --> 39:42.047
Civilian?

39:42.079 --> 39:43.882
Could've turned.

39:43.914 --> 39:45.951
Leave her.

39:45.983 --> 39:47.418
We can't neglect
quarantine!

40:02.000 --> 40:04.302
(coughing)

40:04.335 --> 40:05.570
Stop her!

40:07.237 --> 40:08.639
She's contained.

40:08.673 --> 40:10.275
BUFFY: Contain this!

40:11.009 --> 40:13.445
(shouting)

40:13.478 --> 40:15.012
I'm blind!
Take your mask off!

40:19.416 --> 40:20.318
What the hell was that?

40:34.532 --> 40:36.034
FORREST:
Hostile's escaping! Move!

40:37.936 --> 40:39.971
We gotta stop him!

41:00.958 --> 41:03.494
Abort!

41:21.847 --> 41:23.481
(indistinct P.A. announcements)

41:23.514 --> 41:26.184
I'm sure you'll understand
if I seem far from happy.

41:26.217 --> 41:27.818
Yes, ma'am. If you read
my report you'll see--

41:27.853 --> 41:30.387
Hostile 17's
found an accomplice

41:30.420 --> 41:31.722
who's smart, aggressive,

41:31.757 --> 41:34.291
and somehow
escapes description.

41:34.324 --> 41:35.527
Whoever he was,
the guy was big.

41:35.561 --> 41:36.728
Strong, too.

41:36.762 --> 41:39.364
Whoever... or whatever.

41:39.396 --> 41:41.231
I'm not interested
in guess work, gentlemen.

41:41.266 --> 41:42.568
Call me old-fashioned.

41:42.601 --> 41:44.068
I like results.

41:44.101 --> 41:46.804
This report reads like
a child's riddle book.

41:46.838 --> 41:50.708
Agent Finn,
tell me something good.

41:50.742 --> 41:52.043
My implant?

41:52.077 --> 41:53.344
The implant works.

41:53.378 --> 41:55.346
Hostile 17 can't harm
any living creature,

41:55.380 --> 41:57.481
in any way, without intense
neurological pain.

41:57.514 --> 42:00.552
Can't feed. Can't hardly
even hit anymore.

42:00.585 --> 42:03.387
We'll bag it.

42:03.420 --> 42:06.157
Yes, you will.

42:06.190 --> 42:07.693
Dismissed.

42:09.860 --> 42:13.699
WOMAN (over P.A.): Grid seven
operations chief 3742.

42:27.144 --> 42:28.614
Hey.

42:28.646 --> 42:29.914
Hi.

42:29.947 --> 42:33.050
Listen, sorry about
last night.

42:33.083 --> 42:34.920
No, no... I was rude.

42:34.952 --> 42:37.623
I just felt like
being alone.

42:37.655 --> 42:39.724
Sometimes it's nice

42:39.757 --> 42:41.592
to be out by yourself
at night.

42:41.626 --> 42:43.228
I hear that.

42:43.260 --> 42:44.630
Got to be careful, though.

42:44.663 --> 42:46.530
A lot of strange...
people out there.

42:46.563 --> 42:48.199
Oh, yeah.

42:48.233 --> 42:50.467
How's Willow doing?

42:50.501 --> 42:52.369
Okay.

42:52.402 --> 42:55.039
'Course, that stupid
fraternity prank on our dorm

42:55.072 --> 42:56.541
didn't help any.

42:56.574 --> 42:58.909
That's right. I forgot
you guys live in Stevenson.

42:58.943 --> 43:00.510
You knew that?

43:01.679 --> 43:03.648
Well, Willow and I were...

43:03.681 --> 43:06.483
I thought she might be able
to help me on a project.

43:06.516 --> 43:08.253
Really?

43:08.286 --> 43:10.054
That work out for you?

43:10.088 --> 43:11.789
Don't know yet.

43:11.822 --> 43:14.391
Uh, last night...

43:14.425 --> 43:15.626
at the party,

43:15.661 --> 43:17.161
you wanted
to tell me something?

43:19.197 --> 43:20.965
Oh, yeah.

43:20.998 --> 43:22.634
Very important stuff.

43:24.101 --> 43:25.737
I don't remember
any of it now.

43:25.771 --> 43:27.438
But, you would've
been fascinated.

43:27.472 --> 43:29.007
Possibly even moved.

43:30.675 --> 43:33.277
Did Willow tell you
I like cheese?

43:34.980 --> 43:36.947
You're a little peculiar.

43:38.148 --> 43:40.686
I can live with that.

44:25.831 --> 44:28.266
Grr. Argh.
