00:08.142 --> 00:10.511
[* Shiloh:
"Raise a little hell now"]

00:22.556 --> 00:24.458
* Hit the ground,
look around *

00:24.492 --> 00:27.328
* Do you like what you see?

00:27.361 --> 00:29.597
* Or is your world
a little wasted? *

00:29.630 --> 00:31.599
* Rock the bells,
scream and yell *

00:31.632 --> 00:34.068
* Do you get what you need?

00:34.102 --> 00:36.737
* We'll start a riot
in the basement *

00:36.770 --> 00:40.441
* Jump the line, look behind
All the other soldiers *

00:40.474 --> 00:44.178
* At our little party

00:44.212 --> 00:45.746
* Make some noise,
girls and boys *

00:45.779 --> 00:47.515
* Let the sound of your voice

00:47.548 --> 00:49.483
* Get you out of your seat

00:49.517 --> 00:52.620
* Everybody say hey, yeah

00:52.653 --> 00:55.456
* We gonna raise
a little hell now *

00:55.489 --> 00:58.092
* Hell now

00:58.126 --> 00:59.793
* Hey, yeah

00:59.827 --> 01:01.695
* We gonna raise
a little hell now *

01:01.729 --> 01:04.098
I'm really here.

01:04.132 --> 01:07.301
* Ready or not, baby,
here we come *

01:07.335 --> 01:10.771
* Gonna go all night
'til the morning sun *

01:10.804 --> 01:14.275
* Everybody say hey, yeah

01:14.308 --> 01:16.510
* We're gonna raise
a little hell now *

01:16.544 --> 01:18.379
* Hell now

01:19.647 --> 01:21.482
* Catch a ride,
feel the vibe *

01:21.515 --> 01:23.351
* Taking over the street

01:23.384 --> 01:24.752
Payson! Over here!

01:26.487 --> 01:28.088
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:28.122 --> 01:29.290
- How are you?
- Hi.

01:29.323 --> 01:30.591
[squeals]

01:32.126 --> 01:33.427
[exhales]

01:33.461 --> 01:35.563
We actually made it, guys.
Can you believe it!?

01:35.596 --> 01:37.798
I know!
The US Training Center!

01:37.831 --> 01:39.733
Next stop, Olympic Village!

01:39.767 --> 01:42.803
- [screaming, laughing]
- * Make some noise,
girls and boys *

01:42.836 --> 01:44.605
* Let the sound of your voice

01:44.638 --> 01:46.374
* Get you out of your seat

01:46.407 --> 01:47.708
* Everybody say...

01:47.741 --> 01:49.410
[Sasha] Payson, Kaylie, Lauren.

01:49.443 --> 01:51.745
Individually, they're as
good as anyone at this camp.

01:51.779 --> 01:54.682
But, together?
Together they are unbeatable.

01:54.715 --> 01:58.085
Payson Keeler.
Solid. Dependable.

01:58.118 --> 02:00.721
But since her back surgery,
I haven't seen anything special.

02:00.754 --> 02:03.090
- You think she's peaked?
- Absolutely not.

02:03.123 --> 02:05.726
That one-legged landing
at Worlds was a stunt.

02:05.759 --> 02:07.828
The media loved it
but it doesn't win any medals.

02:07.861 --> 02:10.564
What's significant about that
landing is she's an athlete

02:10.598 --> 02:12.533
who'll give you everything
you ask and more.

02:12.566 --> 02:13.801
She has not peaked.

02:13.834 --> 02:16.237
Well, her D score is low.

02:16.270 --> 02:17.671
Does she have
a triple anything anymore?

02:17.705 --> 02:18.872
Her E score is through the roof.

02:18.906 --> 02:20.841
And her difficulty score
will improve.

02:20.874 --> 02:22.610
That's what she's
doing here, right?

02:22.643 --> 02:24.278
Lauren Tanner.

02:24.312 --> 02:27.181
Word around the NGO is
she's a spoiled princess.

02:27.215 --> 02:29.217
And by NGO you mean Ellen Beals?

02:29.250 --> 02:32.220
The girl can wear a damn tiara
as far as I'm concerned.

02:32.253 --> 02:34.722
All I care about is,
is she coachable?

02:34.755 --> 02:37.358
Yes she's coachable.

02:37.391 --> 02:38.892
And she'll bring you
enormous scores on beam.

02:38.926 --> 02:41.529
Right. She's a specialist.

02:41.562 --> 02:43.431
And I need every girl
to be all around.

02:43.464 --> 02:44.898
Kaylie Cruz...

02:44.932 --> 02:46.600
We're working on a
two-and-a-half twist
on her floor.

02:46.634 --> 02:47.868
She should have it ready
in time for London.

02:47.901 --> 02:49.470
Impressive, coach.
But I was going to ask

02:49.503 --> 02:51.305
about her eating disorder.
Where is she with that?

02:52.706 --> 02:55.376
She got the help she needed.
It's under control.

02:55.409 --> 02:57.144
Plus she has
a good support system.

02:57.177 --> 02:59.247
Her friends?
Payson and Lauren?

02:59.280 --> 03:00.681
[chuckles]

03:00.714 --> 03:02.583
How supportive you think
her friends will be

03:02.616 --> 03:03.817
if it comes down
to them or Kaylie Cruz

03:03.851 --> 03:05.753
for a spot on
the Olympic Team?

03:05.786 --> 03:08.522
These Rock girls are special.

03:08.556 --> 03:12.192
They truly believe that,
together, there is nothing
they cannot achieve.

03:12.226 --> 03:13.794
- And I believe that, too.
- Great.

03:13.827 --> 03:16.830
Thing is, how good can they be
without each other?

03:17.965 --> 03:20.768
Hmm? Can they handle that?

03:20.801 --> 03:23.837
One may make it.
Two may make it.

03:23.871 --> 03:25.939
None of them might make it.

03:25.973 --> 03:27.641
The best of the best are here.

03:27.675 --> 03:30.478
You never know who might step up
and take their place.

03:39.887 --> 03:43.691
Nice boots. Looks like
you put some miles on 'em.

03:43.724 --> 03:46.494
Thrift store. Came that way.

03:46.527 --> 03:48.195
So, where you from?

03:48.228 --> 03:50.197
No place special.

03:50.230 --> 03:52.833
Ya gotta be careful out there.
It can be dangerous.

03:52.866 --> 03:54.635
I know how to
take care of myself.

04:01.309 --> 04:04.912
Go ahead. I'm not gonna eat it.

04:12.486 --> 04:15.222
Um... I was born in Pittsburgh,

04:15.255 --> 04:19.727
but, uh... I've lived
all over the east coast.

04:19.760 --> 04:22.430
Five towns.
Five different families.

04:44.017 --> 04:45.419
Thanks for the lift, Marge.

04:45.453 --> 04:46.987
Good luck, Jordan.

04:48.689 --> 04:50.891
Luck's got nothing
to do with it.

04:57.698 --> 05:00.401
Seriously? A cappuccino machine?

05:00.434 --> 05:02.970
Alex wouldn't even
let Kaylie bring a TV.

05:03.003 --> 05:07.040
We've been over this. She's here
to train, not watch television.

05:07.074 --> 05:08.909
Remember what it was like
when you went to college?

05:08.942 --> 05:12.045
Brought a hot plate and ramen
noodles. Thought I had it made.

05:12.079 --> 05:13.313
Beanbag chair for me.

05:13.347 --> 05:14.348
No, no, no. Please,

05:14.382 --> 05:16.283
no stories of
the olden days.

05:16.316 --> 05:18.051
And this isn't college.

05:18.085 --> 05:21.321
We've got to get you moved in,
so let's get some pictures, huh?

05:21.355 --> 05:25.092
Lots and lots of pictures so I
can remember what you look like.

05:26.460 --> 05:28.028
- Come on.
- [Ronnie] Here we go.

05:28.962 --> 05:29.963
[shutter clicking]

05:34.535 --> 05:35.536
[Mark] Perfect.

05:37.671 --> 05:41.375
Perfect. Now move
a little closer together.

05:41.409 --> 05:42.943
I always knew this was
how it was going to be.

05:42.976 --> 05:44.512
How what was going to be?

05:44.545 --> 05:46.947
Us. Being here. Training for
the Olympic Team.

05:46.980 --> 05:48.949
Uh... scootch a little
to your right.

05:48.982 --> 05:50.518
Scootching!

05:51.852 --> 05:53.487
Other girls come,
other girls go...

05:53.521 --> 05:55.689
OK, look this way.

05:57.991 --> 06:00.027
But in the end,
it's just us.

06:00.060 --> 06:01.895
One-two-three,
three-two-one.

06:01.929 --> 06:03.731
Nothing's ever going
to separate us.

06:03.764 --> 06:05.065
[Ronnie] Smile, girls!

06:11.772 --> 06:13.774
[crowd cheering]

06:19.146 --> 06:20.714
[upbeat pop music playing]

06:20.748 --> 06:23.784
* I'm taking off,
taking off for the weekend *

06:23.817 --> 06:26.620
- Surprise!
- Oh. Ew! Oh...

06:26.654 --> 06:28.055
Oh! What is that?

06:28.088 --> 06:29.557
I'm developing my own fragrance.

06:29.590 --> 06:33.093
My dad's working on a deal
with QVC! Isn't it amazing!?

06:33.126 --> 06:34.828
If you like the smell
of bug spray.

06:34.862 --> 06:36.029
I'm calling it "Winner".

06:36.063 --> 06:38.031
Because who doesn't want to
smell like a winner, right?

06:38.065 --> 06:39.066
Maybe you should
just bottle sweat,

06:39.099 --> 06:40.768
since that's what it
takes to be a real winner.

06:40.801 --> 06:42.536
Pay, can we finish up
here later?

06:42.570 --> 06:44.104
I'm supposed to meet Austin.

06:44.137 --> 06:45.372
Sure.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.708
- You excited to see him?
- Yeah.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.977
He's been training here
for a week already
with the boys

06:50.010 --> 06:52.446
and it's been the longest we've
been apart since Worlds.

06:52.480 --> 06:55.716
[Payson] Poor baby.
I haven't seen Max in months.

06:55.749 --> 06:58.686
But, in a way, I feel
closer to him than ever.

06:58.719 --> 07:01.054
He writes the most
amazing letters.

07:01.088 --> 07:03.524
What are you, Amish?
Who writes letters anymore?

07:03.557 --> 07:04.758
[Payson] I know it's
old-fashioned

07:04.792 --> 07:06.460
but that's what I love about it.

07:06.494 --> 07:08.929
His letters are thoughtful
and so romantic.

07:08.962 --> 07:10.998
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
OK, what does he write you?

07:11.031 --> 07:12.500
I want details.
Spillage.

07:12.533 --> 07:15.068
It's none of your business.

07:15.102 --> 07:17.805
In other words,
they're boring.

07:18.906 --> 07:20.007
Or dirty.

07:20.040 --> 07:22.175
Is Max sending you
dirty letters?!

07:22.209 --> 07:24.478
If he was, I wouldn't spill.

07:24.512 --> 07:25.746
Fine.

07:25.779 --> 07:28.148
You know, I almost feel sorry
for the two of you,

07:28.181 --> 07:30.117
being stuck with boyfriends.

07:30.150 --> 07:32.786
Oh, this oughta be good.

07:32.820 --> 07:35.989
I'm serious. We're gonna be
here for eight weeks,

07:36.023 --> 07:38.759
on a campus filled
with hundreds of gorgeous,

07:38.792 --> 07:40.628
homesick, lonely boys.

07:40.661 --> 07:42.496
Who happen to have
the best bodies in the USA.

07:42.530 --> 07:45.165
[sighs] And, since we're
finally allowed to date

07:45.198 --> 07:47.034
without having
to sneak around,

07:47.067 --> 07:51.204
I, for one, plan on making their
stay a little less lonely.

07:51.238 --> 07:53.574
- Oh, no. No!
- Get it out. Out!

07:53.607 --> 07:54.842
- [spraying]
- [shouting continues]

07:56.176 --> 07:58.145
* Beautiful, like a dream

07:58.178 --> 08:00.180
* Wouldn't change anything

08:00.213 --> 08:01.582
* 'Cause I gotcha...

08:01.615 --> 08:03.684
What's with the rubbing?

08:03.717 --> 08:05.152
Everyone, meet Otis.

08:05.185 --> 08:07.721
It's a tradition
to rub his head for luck.

08:07.755 --> 08:09.857
- Who was he?
- Track-and-field official.

08:09.890 --> 08:11.825
He was killed on campus
a long time ago.

08:11.859 --> 08:14.662
- What happened?
- Death by javelin.

08:14.695 --> 08:16.897
He was looking down
when he should've looking up.

08:16.930 --> 08:20.033
[laughs] That's tragic.

08:20.067 --> 08:24.137
True. But somehow Otis's
misfortune has become our luck.

08:24.171 --> 08:25.639
Better rub him
while he's still here.

08:25.673 --> 08:27.675
Is he going anywhere?

08:27.708 --> 08:29.643
He's a victim of tradition.

08:29.677 --> 08:31.478
Every year a team steals him.

08:31.511 --> 08:33.513
Then another team
steals him back.

08:33.547 --> 08:34.982
Whoever has him
at the end of camp

08:35.015 --> 08:37.084
always medals at the Olympics.

08:37.117 --> 08:38.118
Oh.

08:43.123 --> 08:45.225
Whoa, whoa!

08:45.258 --> 08:47.160
Whoa, easy there.

08:47.194 --> 08:48.796
I'm just a little light-headed.

08:48.829 --> 08:51.131
Probably the altitude.
I'm going to miss you.

08:51.164 --> 08:54.167
Hey. Me, too.

08:54.201 --> 08:57.838
Listen, I've done a little
research on Coach McIntire

08:57.871 --> 09:00.608
and he puts a lot of stock
in first impressions.

09:00.641 --> 09:03.110
The sooner you can show him
what you've got,

09:03.143 --> 09:04.578
the better.
Understand?

09:07.247 --> 09:10.550
So, when you come to visit,
um, will you bring Dad?

09:11.952 --> 09:17.124
You know he'll be here.
Even if we're not together.

09:17.157 --> 09:18.158
Come here.

09:21.962 --> 09:25.265
Can I count on you to keep
an eye on my little girl?

09:25.298 --> 09:28.301
Absolutely. 100 percent.

09:30.003 --> 09:31.271
Make it 110 percent.

09:35.242 --> 09:36.810
So, you sure you have
everything you need?

09:36.844 --> 09:40.147
Yeah. And if I don't, I can
just borrow it from Lauren.

09:42.115 --> 09:43.316
I'm going to miss you, kiddo.

09:43.350 --> 09:45.653
Well, if you ever want
to see me...

09:45.686 --> 09:48.321
...I'll be right here.

09:48.355 --> 09:51.224
Man, who knew when we used to
stop you from flipping over

09:51.258 --> 09:53.894
the top rail of the banister
when you were three

09:53.927 --> 09:55.095
that we would end up here?

09:56.664 --> 09:58.298
I am so proud of you.

09:58.331 --> 10:00.333
Dad...

10:04.838 --> 10:08.108
Coach McIntire?
My name is Jordan Randall.

10:08.141 --> 10:09.242
I know who you are.

10:09.276 --> 10:11.645
I'm here to try out
for the team.

10:11.679 --> 10:14.682
Darling, you need
to be invited to camp.

10:14.715 --> 10:17.284
By me. And I did not
invite you.

10:17.317 --> 10:18.786
I know that.

10:18.819 --> 10:20.921
But I think you
should make an exception.

10:20.954 --> 10:22.622
- And why would I do that?
- Because I'm better

10:22.656 --> 10:24.024
than the girls you invited.

10:24.057 --> 10:26.093
I was junior champion
four years ago...

10:26.126 --> 10:28.295
And you were a source of trouble
at every club you trained at.

10:30.197 --> 10:32.365
- I can explain...
- Not interested.

10:32.399 --> 10:35.869
You haven't competed in a
sanctioned event in two years.

10:35.903 --> 10:37.270
Do I have my facts right?

10:39.840 --> 10:41.909
- Yes.
- Then we're done here.
Go home.

10:43.276 --> 10:44.945
[dialing]

10:48.749 --> 10:51.218
You all know how proud
I am of what you accomplished.

10:51.251 --> 10:53.821
But this is where
the real work starts.

10:53.854 --> 10:55.288
What's Coach McIntire like?

10:55.322 --> 10:56.724
He's... a fair man.

10:56.757 --> 10:59.626
And I expect you to show him the
same respect you've shown me.

10:59.659 --> 11:02.896
Sure, but we'll never
like him as much as we do you.

11:02.930 --> 11:05.165
- You bloody-well better not.
- [laughing]

11:05.198 --> 11:07.067
Wait, one last "Rock On?"

11:11.939 --> 11:15.675
For the next eight weeks you
need to forget about The Rock.

11:15.709 --> 11:18.178
Your focus belongs
on making the Olympic Team.

11:25.118 --> 11:26.720
Payson.

11:26.754 --> 11:29.422
Go. It might be that kiss
you've been waiting for.

11:29.456 --> 11:31.358
[Lauren chuckles]

11:36.997 --> 11:38.932
Tag. You're it.

11:38.966 --> 11:41.334
Think you could hold on
to that until London?

11:43.403 --> 11:45.939
This is our last run, isn't it?

11:45.973 --> 11:47.875
This is where your dreams
become a reality

11:47.908 --> 11:49.376
or where they're left to die.

11:49.409 --> 11:51.378
It's up to you.

11:56.449 --> 11:57.951
[door opens]

12:01.221 --> 12:02.722
[door closes]

12:13.166 --> 12:15.335
Hey, hey!
Hey, yo, yo, yo!

12:15.368 --> 12:17.070
Hold that girl, man!
She stole my phone!

12:17.104 --> 12:18.271
Yo, she stole my phone!

12:18.305 --> 12:20.073
Hold it right there, miss!

12:22.075 --> 12:23.410
I left my jacket
on the bench.

12:23.443 --> 12:25.846
My phone was in the pocket and
she was the only one there.

12:25.879 --> 12:26.814
Are you crazy?

12:26.847 --> 12:27.948
Man, check her bag.

12:27.981 --> 12:29.482
I guarantee you
that's where it's at.

12:29.516 --> 12:30.918
I've never seen
this guy before.

12:30.951 --> 12:32.853
Are you sure this is the girl?

12:32.886 --> 12:34.955
[sniffs] Definitely.

12:34.988 --> 12:36.790
I'd know that smell anywhere.

12:36.824 --> 12:38.792
It's pretty hard to miss.

12:38.826 --> 12:41.394
Why don't you let me
take a look in that bag.

12:41.428 --> 12:43.330
Knock yourself out.

12:47.968 --> 12:50.337
Whoa, this is embarrassing.

12:50.370 --> 12:53.807
Wrong pocket, man.
I had it the whole time.

12:53.841 --> 12:55.008
I'm sorry.

12:55.475 --> 12:56.476
My bad.

13:02.549 --> 13:04.117
You used me.

13:04.151 --> 13:06.053
Welcome to the TC.

13:11.558 --> 13:12.960
[bell dings]

13:12.993 --> 13:14.261
Hey, do you have
anything for 305?

13:14.294 --> 13:15.428
Yeah, I do.

13:17.230 --> 13:19.432
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

13:27.908 --> 13:31.378
[girl] Lauren Tanner?
[gasps]

13:31.411 --> 13:33.313
- What's going on?
- Nothing! I wasn't...

13:34.915 --> 13:36.083
- Who are you?
- Oh...

13:36.116 --> 13:37.851
Wendy Capshaw, juniors champ.

13:37.885 --> 13:40.553
Your beam in Rio
was totally amazo.

13:40.587 --> 13:42.189
The standing-
full-twisting-back-salto

13:42.222 --> 13:43.891
was a little Shawn Johnson,

13:43.924 --> 13:46.193
but if you're going to borrow,
borrow from the best, right?

13:47.861 --> 13:49.229
- Were you in...
- Rio? No.

13:49.262 --> 13:51.098
But I saw it all on TV.

13:51.131 --> 13:53.000
You are so much prettier
in person.

13:53.033 --> 13:54.301
I guess I'm lucky.

13:54.334 --> 13:55.936
I'm just as pretty on TV.

13:55.969 --> 13:57.270
Yeah. [clears throat]
I should probably...

13:57.304 --> 13:58.338
Yeah, me too.

13:58.371 --> 13:59.806
But maybe we can hang later.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.208
I really want to know
everything about you.

14:01.241 --> 14:02.910
Like... what's your
favorite color?

14:02.943 --> 14:04.011
Mine's purple, like Barney.

14:04.044 --> 14:05.412
I used to be crazy about him.

14:05.445 --> 14:08.381
He was so optimistic.
Just like me.

14:08.415 --> 14:10.017
I knew I was going to win
juniors this year.

14:10.050 --> 14:11.919
Just like I know I'll make
the Olympic Team.

14:11.952 --> 14:13.887
I already have a higher point
total than any of you seniors.

14:14.955 --> 14:16.023
How old are you?

14:16.056 --> 14:18.058
I turn 16 the day the team
flies to London.

14:18.091 --> 14:19.559
- [squeals]
- [mocks squeal]

14:19.592 --> 14:22.029
Crazy, right?
I'll be peaking just in time.

14:23.396 --> 14:25.598
Yeah, crazy. [chuckles]

14:29.069 --> 14:31.538
So much for "all for one
and one for all."

14:31.571 --> 14:32.940
What are you talking about?

14:32.973 --> 14:35.909
Kaylie's still MIA.
I'm not waiting up for her.

14:35.943 --> 14:39.379
Oh, they said downstairs
that you picked up the mail.

14:39.412 --> 14:40.347
Was there anything for me?

14:40.380 --> 14:42.482
No. Were you expecting
something?

14:42.515 --> 14:46.053
Max knew this was my first day.
I hoped there be a letter.

14:46.086 --> 14:48.188
Hey, roomies.

14:48.221 --> 14:50.223
I'm sorry, do we know you?

14:50.257 --> 14:52.292
The face is vaguely familiar.

14:52.325 --> 14:55.028
I know, I know.
I'm sorry I bailed on you.

14:55.062 --> 14:56.629
Austin wanted me
to meet his friends

14:56.663 --> 15:00.400
and we lost track of time.

15:00.433 --> 15:03.070
It's fine. There's a party
we can all go to tomorrow.

15:03.103 --> 15:06.573
Forget tomorrow. I want to
do something fun now.

15:06.606 --> 15:08.208
Just the three of us.

15:08.241 --> 15:10.110
What'd you have in mind?

15:10.143 --> 15:12.980
- Well...
- [giggling]

15:13.013 --> 15:16.449
[laughing, chattering]

15:16.483 --> 15:19.252
- [all] Woo!
- Wrestlers are gonna medal!

15:19.286 --> 15:21.388
Only if you can hang on to Otis!

15:23.623 --> 15:25.158
OK.

15:25.592 --> 15:26.659
Hey guys, wait up.

15:29.997 --> 15:31.364
[door rattling]

15:38.138 --> 15:39.506
[girls gasp]

15:43.143 --> 15:45.412
This is epic.

15:45.445 --> 15:50.017
Think of all the Olympic
champions who have trained...
here.

15:50.050 --> 15:54.187
- And now... us.
- [giggling]

15:54.221 --> 15:56.223
Speaking of Olympic glory.

15:56.256 --> 15:58.325
[gasping, laughing]

15:58.358 --> 16:01.328
Bronze, silver, gold.

16:01.361 --> 16:04.264
- What's it going to be?
- [all laughing]

16:06.233 --> 16:07.600
[laughter continues]

16:10.003 --> 16:11.571
OK...

16:11.604 --> 16:13.573
Maybe we should take turns.

16:13.606 --> 16:15.375
OK, you first,
National Champion.

16:15.408 --> 16:17.477
Well, don't mind if I do.

16:17.510 --> 16:20.247
- Kaylie! Yeah!
- Yeah! America!

16:20.280 --> 16:22.382
[Kaylie laughs]
OK, your turn.

16:24.117 --> 16:26.253
- [sighs]
- [girls cheering]

16:26.286 --> 16:29.089
- Go, Lauren!
- USA!

16:29.122 --> 16:30.290
[cheering]

16:30.323 --> 16:33.226
- She tripped
getting up there.
- [laughing]

16:33.260 --> 16:35.228
- OK.
- Hoping that
doesn't really happen.

16:35.262 --> 16:38.265
[cheering]

16:38.298 --> 16:40.300
- [Kaylie] Payson!
- [Payson] OK, now together.
Together.

16:41.234 --> 16:43.270
- [clears throat]
- Ooh, you OK?

16:43.303 --> 16:45.572
Yeah... just a little dizzy.

16:45.605 --> 16:48.541
It's your perfume, Lo.
It's making me dizzy.

16:48.575 --> 16:49.976
I'm just excited.

16:50.009 --> 16:53.113
This is amazing, isn't it?
We're really here.

16:53.146 --> 16:57.317
Nothing compared to what we'll
feel in London. Imagine it.

16:57.350 --> 17:02.055
We've dreamed of this.
And now we're here, together,

17:02.089 --> 17:04.691
let's promise not to let
anything or anyone

17:04.724 --> 17:07.294
get in way of us
going all the way.

17:17.270 --> 17:20.340
[Steve] Yeah, well...
Lauren, honey...

17:20.373 --> 17:24.444
Look, slow down, sweetie.
You're not making any sense.

17:24.477 --> 17:27.314
What do you mean,
"Winning makes you sick?"

17:27.347 --> 17:29.716
No, not winning, Winner!
My fragrance!

17:29.749 --> 17:31.351
We have to change the formula.

17:31.384 --> 17:33.320
I think something in it
makes me dizzy, Dad.

17:33.353 --> 17:36.423
Well, ha...
Have you seen a doctor?

17:36.456 --> 17:38.658
No, I'm fine. I just can't wear
that perfume anymore.

17:38.691 --> 17:40.260
And I definitely
cannot put my name

17:40.293 --> 17:41.628
on something that makes
people sick!

17:41.661 --> 17:43.663
OK, I'll handle the perfume.

17:43.696 --> 17:46.299
You just concentrate
on why you're there.

17:46.333 --> 17:47.734
To make the Olympic Team.

17:47.767 --> 17:49.102
I know, I know.

17:49.136 --> 17:51.404
'Cause if you don't,
Kaylie and Payson will.

17:51.438 --> 17:52.739
It's every girl for herself.

17:53.840 --> 17:54.807
Understood.

17:54.841 --> 17:57.544
Good. Look, I gotta go.

17:57.577 --> 18:00.380
Oh, and uh... I love you.

18:00.413 --> 18:01.848
I love you too, Daddy.

18:04.117 --> 18:05.118
[phone beeps]

18:13.660 --> 18:14.761
[clears throat]

18:28.875 --> 18:30.109
[scoffs]

18:39.386 --> 18:41.454
I don't like being stalked.

18:41.488 --> 18:43.190
And I don't like
being told to go home.

18:43.223 --> 18:45.258
So, guess that
makes us even.

18:50.129 --> 18:51.464
If you're trying to charm me,

18:51.498 --> 18:53.533
you're making one
sorry ass mess of it.

18:53.566 --> 18:55.535
Charm is for beauty pageants.

18:55.568 --> 18:57.904
I'm just here to make
the Olympic Team.

18:58.471 --> 18:59.472
What's that?

18:59.506 --> 19:00.840
I borrowed your camcorder.

19:00.873 --> 19:02.375
You need to see what I can do.

19:02.409 --> 19:04.277
Did you also borrow my gym?

19:04.311 --> 19:06.313
Find out. Watch the video.

19:06.346 --> 19:09.416
I will not watch that video and
I will not tell you this again,

19:09.449 --> 19:10.717
go home.

19:10.750 --> 19:12.852
I am home!

19:23.430 --> 19:25.765
Come on, guys.
Let's go.

19:25.798 --> 19:27.434
Oh, Payson, look what came.

19:27.467 --> 19:28.901
Your letter from Max.
I told you it'd come.

19:28.935 --> 19:31.137
- Thanks.
- Aren't you going
to read it?

19:31.170 --> 19:33.240
Not now. I don't want to be late
for our first practice.

19:33.273 --> 19:36.743
- We have time.
- And you were
so anxious to get it.

19:36.776 --> 19:38.678
I know that this is
gonna sound pathetic,

19:38.711 --> 19:41.448
but... reading his letter
is as close as I get

19:41.481 --> 19:42.715
to being on a date with him.

19:42.749 --> 19:44.183
I just want to wait for tonight.

19:44.217 --> 19:47.320
Wow. That really doesn't
say much for your dates.

19:47.354 --> 19:49.456
- [mocks laughter]
- [girls chuckle]

19:54.461 --> 19:56.396
What do those
numbers mean?

19:57.564 --> 19:59.666
That's Coach McIntire's
ranking system.

19:59.699 --> 20:00.800
Uh, how do you know that?

20:00.833 --> 20:02.702
I've researched
everything about him.

20:02.735 --> 20:04.404
He likes to change
the rankings every day,

20:04.437 --> 20:07.474
based on statistics,
intel, his gut.

20:07.507 --> 20:09.876
He personally coaches all
the girls on the left side
of the board.

20:09.909 --> 20:12.211
The girls on the right
get the assistant coaches.

20:12.245 --> 20:14.314
You do not want to be
on the right side.

20:14.347 --> 20:15.948
That's like... one step away

20:15.982 --> 20:17.584
from packing your
Hello Kitty bag.

20:17.617 --> 20:19.486
Well, you're OK.
You're number four.

20:19.519 --> 20:21.187
He's just trying to motivate me.

20:21.220 --> 20:23.456
I'll be higher soon.
Later gator.

20:25.858 --> 20:29.228
And now I know why alligators
eat their young.

20:29.262 --> 20:30.797
It's time to man up, ladies.

20:30.830 --> 20:35.502
Five-pound ankle weights.
Laps. Let's go!

20:35.535 --> 20:38.571
Pick it up ladies!

20:38.605 --> 20:42.675
One day at this camp is worth
one week anywhere else.

20:42.709 --> 20:45.244
If you think I'm being unfair,

20:45.278 --> 20:48.548
hey, the door's
right over there.

20:48.581 --> 20:51.584
Olympic Trials
are eight weeks from today.

20:51.618 --> 20:53.486
Look around you.

20:53.520 --> 20:56.222
Not all of you will be here
when that day arrives.

20:56.255 --> 21:00.327
At least one-third of you
will be going home before then.

21:01.594 --> 21:02.995
The team chosen to go to London

21:03.029 --> 21:06.533
will be made up
of only five girls.

21:06.566 --> 21:07.500
Five.

21:08.668 --> 21:10.503
There's the three of us.
Who else?

21:10.537 --> 21:12.572
- Who cares?
- True.

21:12.605 --> 21:13.806
Your team affiliation

21:13.840 --> 21:16.943
or your club affiliations
do not interest me.

21:16.976 --> 21:20.647
I am looking for five
outstanding individuals

21:20.680 --> 21:24.016
who can stand strong alone
and in any combination.

21:25.885 --> 21:27.720
Off your toes.

21:32.925 --> 21:35.562
- Lauren, are you OK?
- Lo, what happened?

21:35.595 --> 21:37.564
Back in line.
Back in line!

21:37.597 --> 21:39.932
Hello! Back in line!

21:39.966 --> 21:41.634
I didn't give
permission to stop.

21:44.504 --> 21:45.605
I'm fine.

21:45.638 --> 21:47.874
Go see the nutritionist.
She'll decide.

21:47.907 --> 21:50.343
I do not have time for girls who
do not take care of themselves.

21:50.377 --> 21:51.378
Move.

21:53.780 --> 21:55.848
Do not bend your knees.

22:26.345 --> 22:29.348
I want you to follow
this diet plan to control
your blood sugar.

22:29.382 --> 22:32.952
Pay attention to the
glycemic index of the foods
you're eating.

22:32.985 --> 22:36.556
And do not skip
any more meals.

22:36.589 --> 22:38.958
I won't. I just got busy
this morning.

22:38.991 --> 22:42.829
That's no excuse. There's always
time to eat something.

22:42.862 --> 22:44.931
Keep a few of these on hand.

22:44.964 --> 22:49.335
And if you have any more dizzy
spells, I want to know about it.

22:49.368 --> 22:51.904
This is not the time to be
taking chances with your health.

22:51.938 --> 22:53.973
- Got it.
- OK.

22:56.876 --> 23:00.647
You don't need to tell the coach
I skipped breakfast, right?

23:00.680 --> 23:02.715
I don't keep anything
from Coach McIntire.

23:02.749 --> 23:06.819
If there are no more
dizzy spells, you have
nothing to worry about.

23:06.853 --> 23:08.721
[exhales]

23:14.126 --> 23:15.628
- Thanks.
- Of course.

23:16.963 --> 23:18.631
Well?

23:18.665 --> 23:22.969
I'm fine. She prescribed
a couple of these. Gag me.

23:23.002 --> 23:24.937
Glad to be of service.

23:24.971 --> 23:25.872
Now let's go to the party.

23:25.905 --> 23:27.907
Um, I'll actually
meet you there

23:27.940 --> 23:32.445
- 'cause I have to meet up...
- Austin? Quelle surprise.

23:32.912 --> 23:33.913
Ha ha!

23:38.050 --> 23:41.754
Temporary setback. I'll be back
on top before you know it.

23:48.995 --> 23:50.963
How's Lauren Tanner?

23:50.997 --> 23:54.634
Slight hypoglycemia.
She should be fine.

23:54.667 --> 23:56.035
I'll make sure
and keep an eye on her.

23:57.770 --> 24:00.439
No. Mm-mm. I am not...

24:00.473 --> 24:01.774
Say hypoglycemia again.

24:01.808 --> 24:03.710
You're sick, you know that?

24:05.478 --> 24:07.446
- Hypoglycemia.
- Mm.

24:07.480 --> 24:09.616
I love the way you make
everything sound sexy.

24:13.720 --> 24:16.088
Oh, don't start something
you can't finish.

24:16.956 --> 24:18.925
I never do.

24:18.958 --> 24:20.026
- Oh yeah?
- Mm-hm.

24:20.059 --> 24:21.494
Well then you should
call your wife

24:21.528 --> 24:23.696
and tell her you're gonna
be home very late tonight.

24:23.730 --> 24:24.931
Mm-hm.

24:29.969 --> 24:32.038
[pop music playing]

24:32.071 --> 24:33.940
* Oh, oh

24:33.973 --> 24:36.208
- Hey, sorry I'm late.
- Hey.

24:36.242 --> 24:38.210
Where's loverboy?
You have him surgically
removed from your hip?

24:38.244 --> 24:40.947
That's easy for you to say.

24:40.980 --> 24:43.015
You're in a long distance
relationship.

24:43.049 --> 24:45.017
Oh, you think that's easy?

24:45.051 --> 24:45.952
I'm jealous you and Austin

24:45.985 --> 24:47.720
get to spend
so much time together.

24:47.754 --> 24:51.624
Well, sometimes I'm jealous
of you and Max too.

24:51.658 --> 24:56.563
I mean, I'm crazy about Austin,
but it's a lot of, um,

24:56.596 --> 24:57.964
- couples time.
- Mm.

24:57.997 --> 25:01.634
Yeah. And I got to say,
Lauren was right.

25:01.668 --> 25:03.102
There are a lot
of hot guys here.

25:04.503 --> 25:05.705
Just saying.

25:05.738 --> 25:09.776
None as cute as Austin,
but I'm not blind.

25:11.010 --> 25:12.645
Where is Lauren?

25:12.679 --> 25:15.548
Mingling.
She's not blind, either.

25:18.951 --> 25:20.953
Hey. Name's Rigo.
Got a question...

25:20.987 --> 25:23.556
- Not interested.
- Hold on, princess,
I wasn't...

25:23.590 --> 25:25.024
Do yourself a favor, Rigo.

25:25.057 --> 25:28.227
Get a real name and then troll
for a hook-up someplace else.

25:28.260 --> 25:30.262
- I'm out of your league.
- Yeah, you're right.

25:30.296 --> 25:32.965
- I don't play in the minors.
- [scoffs]

25:40.139 --> 25:43.209
Good news! I was telling the
marketing company about us.

25:44.276 --> 25:46.045
The reps want to meet you.

25:47.046 --> 25:49.982
Um... Austin thinks
that we can

25:50.016 --> 25:52.852
sell ourselves
as a "golden couple."

25:52.885 --> 25:54.253
- [laughs] Go!
- Yeah.

25:54.286 --> 25:56.022
Go spend some time
with your boyfriend.

25:56.055 --> 25:57.657
I'm gonna head back
to the dorm in a bit

25:57.690 --> 25:59.125
and spend some time
with mine.

26:00.026 --> 26:02.128
OK. Have fun, now.

26:02.161 --> 26:03.930
You too.

26:03.963 --> 26:06.733
Have I told you how glad
I am that you're here?

26:06.766 --> 26:08.635
How seeing your smile
brightens my day?

26:10.102 --> 26:11.137
I hope your friends don't think

26:11.170 --> 26:12.939
I'm taking up too much
of your time.

26:12.972 --> 26:16.709
No. No, of course not.

26:16.743 --> 26:18.244
They get how important
you are to me.

26:23.182 --> 26:26.152
* Hey you, it's war

26:26.185 --> 26:29.288
- [indistinct chatter]
- So where's Otis?

26:29.321 --> 26:31.257
Tucked away in a safe place.

26:31.290 --> 26:33.292
Why? You Barbies
never get it.

26:33.325 --> 26:35.094
Oh, I get plenty.

26:36.362 --> 26:38.064
I'm talking about Otis, here.

26:38.097 --> 26:40.266
You gymnast types
never even try to steal him.

26:40.299 --> 26:43.169
Come on, Jake, let's tell her.
It's not like she can get him.

26:43.202 --> 26:44.804
Stay out of this, Tug.

26:44.837 --> 26:46.138
You don't have
to listen to him.

26:46.172 --> 26:49.141
I just want to rub Otis's head.
For luck.

26:49.175 --> 26:50.376
No.

26:51.644 --> 26:54.146
Just a little rub...

26:54.180 --> 26:55.381
Sorry, Barbie.

27:00.787 --> 27:03.823
What luck, I happen to be
holding two of these. I'm Brad.

27:03.856 --> 27:06.258
Thanks, but I was
getting ready to head out.

27:06.292 --> 27:07.860
This your first go round
at the TC?

27:08.728 --> 27:10.262
Let me guess.
Uh...

27:10.296 --> 27:12.198
You've got the legs
for volleyball

27:12.231 --> 27:14.166
but the upper arm strength
of a boxer...

27:14.200 --> 27:16.068
You think I'm a boxer?

27:16.102 --> 27:19.839
No. You're far too pretty
to be a boxer.

27:19.872 --> 27:21.841
- A swimmer?
- I'm a gymnast.

27:21.874 --> 27:23.710
A gymnast? Whoa.

27:23.743 --> 27:25.277
I thought gymnasts
were like, 12.

27:25.311 --> 27:28.147
Thank God, no.
The 12-year-olds terrify me.

27:28.180 --> 27:31.117
Sometimes I feel like
a little bit of an old lady
in this sport, though.

27:31.150 --> 27:32.685
Is that why you're off to bed?

27:32.719 --> 27:36.122
That and...
I have a boyfriend.

27:38.224 --> 27:39.826
[laughing] Oh, come on!

27:39.859 --> 27:42.328
- Continue that.
- Yeah.

27:44.363 --> 27:46.365
[up-tempo pop music playing]

27:49.736 --> 27:50.970
[sighs]

27:51.003 --> 27:54.206
This'll be fine.
It's only temporary.

27:56.175 --> 27:59.178
I mean, home is where the
heart is, after all. Right?

28:00.880 --> 28:06.318
Look, it's only for eight weeks.
And then we're off to London.

28:06.352 --> 28:09.055
And you'll be
right there with me.

28:10.256 --> 28:14.093
I'd never leave you.
We're in this together.

28:14.126 --> 28:18.030
OK, it's you and me
all the way.

29:04.911 --> 29:07.379
[up-tempo music playing]

29:12.919 --> 29:14.987
* Hot pink chalk

29:15.021 --> 29:19.091
* Against a blackboard

29:19.125 --> 29:22.761
* You can't help
but notice me *

29:24.196 --> 29:27.099
* I'm graffiti

29:27.133 --> 29:31.003
* On your white wall

29:31.037 --> 29:34.306
* For everyone to see

29:35.774 --> 29:38.277
* Gonna leave my mark

29:38.310 --> 29:41.447
* Like a shooting star

29:41.480 --> 29:44.250
* You're gonna know
that I was here *

29:44.283 --> 29:48.087
* You're gonna know
that I was here **

29:52.992 --> 29:54.326
Again.

30:03.903 --> 30:05.071
Again.

30:07.339 --> 30:09.508
What's up with Payson?

30:09.541 --> 30:12.544
She can do an illusion
in her sleep.

30:12.578 --> 30:14.280
Do you know if she, uh...

30:14.313 --> 30:17.083
...read her letter from Max
last night?

30:17.116 --> 30:20.019
She was asleep
when I got back. Why?

30:20.052 --> 30:22.188
What are you two looking at?

30:29.828 --> 30:32.198
Maria Born, in my office.

30:37.303 --> 30:39.038
Get back to work.

30:44.443 --> 30:46.845
I think I know
what's bugging Payson.

30:46.879 --> 30:48.347
The letter from Max,
I accidentally read it.

30:48.380 --> 30:52.218
How do you accidentally read
someone else's letter?

30:52.251 --> 30:54.453
I thought it was for me.
Anyway, it's a good thing I did,

30:54.486 --> 30:57.523
because I know what's wrong.
Max broke up with her.

31:04.030 --> 31:05.364
Eyes up here, ladies.

31:09.535 --> 31:11.270
Maria Born is going home.

31:11.303 --> 31:13.439
I am one day closer to London,

31:13.472 --> 31:16.275
and I do not have time
to stroke egos.

31:18.177 --> 31:21.180
Keeler, you will now be working
with Coach Webber on vault.

31:21.213 --> 31:22.881
Everyone take five.

31:31.457 --> 31:33.259
Payson, is there
anything we can...

31:33.292 --> 31:35.361
I suck today. It happens.
It's just one day.

31:35.394 --> 31:39.198
Which is really like a week,
according to the coach.

31:39.231 --> 31:41.367
What's the matter?
Is it because of Max?

31:41.400 --> 31:43.135
Did Austin say something?!

31:43.169 --> 31:45.304
No, um...

31:45.337 --> 31:46.905
But we know
you got a letter...

31:46.939 --> 31:48.407
Max broke up with me.

31:49.475 --> 31:53.179
Oh, Payson, I'm sorry.

31:53.212 --> 31:55.081
What did he say?

31:55.114 --> 31:58.050
That his rehab is taking
longer than he thought.

31:58.084 --> 32:01.420
And... that he's confused.

32:01.453 --> 32:02.588
He doesn't know
what he wants anymore.

32:02.621 --> 32:05.124
Uh, he's not sure if
he wants to do gymnastics

32:05.157 --> 32:09.528
or photography
or maybe even art school.

32:09.561 --> 32:12.598
Uh, he said that
he loves me and...

32:12.631 --> 32:14.133
...but has to let me go.

32:15.401 --> 32:17.636
Well, doesn't that
answer your "why"?

32:17.669 --> 32:20.906
No. No. There has to be
a deeper reason. Me.

32:20.939 --> 32:23.009
I've never done the whole
girlfriend thing before.

32:23.042 --> 32:24.276
Maybe I did something wrong.

32:24.310 --> 32:27.413
Maybe I could change.
If I only knew what I did.

32:29.081 --> 32:31.683
Your five is up. Let's go.
[claps hands]

32:35.587 --> 32:37.689
[Kaylie applauding]
C'mon Pay. You're a star.

32:37.723 --> 32:39.558
You've got it, Pay,
let's do this.

32:41.093 --> 32:43.295
She's going to do Yurchenko
two-and-a-half twist?

32:43.329 --> 32:45.697
With her back?
At her age?

32:48.100 --> 32:50.036
Let's go, Keeler.

32:50.069 --> 32:52.071
You want to see a Yurchenko
two-and-a-half twist?

32:52.104 --> 32:54.506
I've got one that will
leave smoke on the table.

32:55.407 --> 32:58.344
Oh my God, it's Jordan Randall.

32:58.377 --> 33:00.379
[Lauren] Your old friend
Jordan Randall?

33:00.412 --> 33:03.549
No, I just thought she was
my friend, and I was wrong.

33:03.582 --> 33:05.417
What the hell is she doing here?

33:05.451 --> 33:08.754
I told you I was better than
these girls. Now I'll prove it.

33:14.393 --> 33:15.561
Not on my watch.

33:16.662 --> 33:19.398
OK, uneven bars it is.

33:26.405 --> 33:29.375
You ever see
a triple back dismount?

33:29.408 --> 33:31.577
Of course you haven't.
Nobody's ever landed one.

33:31.610 --> 33:34.213
Stop this, Randall. Now.

33:34.246 --> 33:36.182
You do not want me
to call security.

33:36.215 --> 33:37.683
Oh, come on,
I can do the triple.

33:37.716 --> 33:40.086
In your dreams. Get out.

33:40.119 --> 33:43.089
Well, lucky I videotaped
my dream.

33:43.122 --> 33:44.490
It's on the memory stick
I gave you.

33:44.523 --> 33:46.525
All you have to do
is watch it.

33:57.536 --> 33:58.537
Thanks.

34:00.706 --> 34:03.109
- Hey, killer.
- Hey.

34:04.410 --> 34:08.080
Heard you had a tough practice.
Shake it off.

34:08.114 --> 34:10.182
I can't fall apart now.

34:10.216 --> 34:13.385
Austin, please tell me,
did Max say anything to you?

34:13.419 --> 34:17.123
No. But, you have to believe,
it's nothing you did.

34:17.156 --> 34:18.590
Why should I believe that?

34:20.226 --> 34:22.194
Look, Payson,

34:22.228 --> 34:25.497
Max's life is...
complicated.

34:27.366 --> 34:29.135
What does that even mean?

34:31.570 --> 34:33.472
It means that
Max is bisexual.

34:33.505 --> 34:35.507
- What?
- He's bi...

34:35.541 --> 34:37.075
No, I heard you. I just...

34:37.109 --> 34:39.111
I don't believe you.
You're lying.

34:39.145 --> 34:40.679
Payson, Max is on a journey

34:40.712 --> 34:42.414
that he didn't think
you'd be comfortable with.

34:42.448 --> 34:44.082
And I think that's why
he didn't tell you.

34:44.116 --> 34:47.753
- It's not you.
- How did I not know?

34:47.786 --> 34:50.422
I didn't pick up on it either.
And I'm a pro.

34:50.456 --> 34:53.159
We told each other everything.
And the way he kissed me...

34:53.192 --> 34:54.526
- He kissed me too.
- Me too.

34:56.362 --> 34:59.265
Wait... You kissed him?

34:59.298 --> 35:00.466
I'll explain later.

35:00.499 --> 35:02.634
The point is,
he kissed all of us.

35:04.436 --> 35:05.837
That's who Max is.

35:05.871 --> 35:08.807
And I think he wanted
to tell you, Payson.

35:08.840 --> 35:10.209
He just didn't know how.

35:13.612 --> 35:15.381
Now I get why
he didn't pick me.

35:19.418 --> 35:21.720
I'm sorry, I thought that
that would help her.

35:21.753 --> 35:25.157
[deep sigh]
We have to do something.

35:25.191 --> 35:28.594
If she has another day
like she did today in the gym,
she'll be gone.

35:37.869 --> 35:40.138
What's wrong with me?

35:40.172 --> 35:42.508
- Nothing.
- Seriously!

35:42.541 --> 35:45.311
My feelings for Sasha were
completely inappropriate

35:45.344 --> 35:47.379
and Max didn't think
I could handle the truth.

35:48.647 --> 35:50.882
I thought our relationship
was stronger than that.

35:50.916 --> 35:53.385
What relationship?
You had like three dates,

35:53.419 --> 35:55.153
and then he took off
for the Hamptons.

35:55.187 --> 35:58.424
I mean, seriously, it's not like
Max was even a real boyfriend,
Pay.

35:58.457 --> 36:01.126
He was just a glorified pen pal.

36:01.159 --> 36:02.261
Thanks, Lauren.

36:02.294 --> 36:03.595
I'm not going to have you
of all people

36:03.629 --> 36:05.697
be taken down by some
fantasy boyfriend.

36:05.731 --> 36:08.600
We've come too far to let boys
mess with our destiny.

36:08.634 --> 36:10.569
[sighs]

36:10.602 --> 36:13.605
What we need is
a little girl fun.

36:13.639 --> 36:16.908
- Hm?
- Um, a pedicure
won't really fix this.

36:16.942 --> 36:19.411
But, stealing Otis will.

36:19.445 --> 36:22.748
From the wrestlers?
Are you crazy?

36:22.781 --> 36:25.417
Let's just say,
I "persuaded" one of them

36:25.451 --> 36:27.185
into telling me where
they hid Otis.

36:27.219 --> 36:28.920
We need to strike now.
Let's go.

36:28.954 --> 36:31.890
- You two go. I don't know...
- Pity party's over.

36:31.923 --> 36:34.192
I did not just spend the
last half-hour of my life

36:34.226 --> 36:35.661
making out with a
200-pound gorilla

36:35.694 --> 36:38.230
so you could sit here feeling
sorry for yourself.

36:38.264 --> 36:39.698
We all need the luck.

36:39.731 --> 36:41.867
And, uh, you most of all.

36:41.900 --> 36:43.435
So let's go.

36:43.469 --> 36:45.904
- I say let's go. [laughing]
- [grunting]

36:45.937 --> 36:47.939
[Lauren] Otis is up there.

36:47.973 --> 36:49.475
Through the skylight,
on the roof.

36:49.508 --> 36:51.243
There's an access door inside.

36:51.277 --> 36:54.212
Along with at least
two security guards.

36:54.246 --> 36:55.947
No problem, we're just gonna
go inside and say,

36:55.981 --> 36:58.250
"Bring us the head
of Otis!" Please.

36:58.284 --> 36:59.818
Guys, we can do this.

36:59.851 --> 37:01.920
We have to show up
those annoying wrestlers.

37:01.953 --> 37:04.189
Come on, let's go
around the back. [squeals]

37:04.222 --> 37:05.223
- Mm-mm.
- Mm-hm.

37:05.257 --> 37:06.958
- Mm-mm. Mm-mm!
- Mm-hm. [laughs]

37:06.992 --> 37:09.528
[* Plushgun: "How We Roll"]

37:12.664 --> 37:13.865
Let's try upstairs.

37:27.879 --> 37:28.880
[exhales]

37:30.248 --> 37:31.583
OK. Lift me up.

37:32.751 --> 37:34.386
Have you just lost your mind?

37:34.420 --> 37:36.822
No. It'll be easy.
I'll just flip on up.

37:36.855 --> 37:38.990
Someone could see you up there.

37:39.024 --> 37:42.561
Not if you're my lookouts.
Come on, spot me.

37:43.028 --> 37:44.330
- Come on!
- No.

37:44.363 --> 37:46.598
- OK.
- Ready?

37:48.033 --> 37:51.002
* Hey you cheerleaders,
we're superior *

37:51.036 --> 37:53.472
* We're only losers 'til we
reach the end of senior year *

37:53.505 --> 37:56.375
* We never comb our hair, our
clothes are out of fashion *

37:56.408 --> 37:57.876
Let me know when
the coast is clear.

37:57.909 --> 38:00.879
I'll meet you back in front,
with Otis.

38:01.613 --> 38:03.248
[giggling]

38:03.281 --> 38:05.951
* Driving through
the summer air *

38:05.984 --> 38:08.587
* Yeah, this is how we roll

38:08.620 --> 38:10.956
* The suburban pioneers

38:10.989 --> 38:14.726
* Yeah, this is how we roll

38:14.760 --> 38:17.463
* With the black dye
in our hair *

38:17.496 --> 38:19.965
* Yeah, this is how we roll

38:19.998 --> 38:23.068
* We're the rebels
of senior year *

38:27.573 --> 38:30.442
* Hey consumer girls
In your motorcades *

38:30.476 --> 38:33.044
* 'Cause that's what daddy buys
A new Mercedes *

38:33.078 --> 38:36.047
* But you would laugh at us
back in junior high *

38:36.081 --> 38:38.784
* As we lost track of time
in dreams of grandeur *

38:38.817 --> 38:40.051
[panting]

38:40.085 --> 38:42.854
* Who's the one gone VIP, yeah
Tell me, tell me *

38:42.888 --> 38:45.724
* Where's your boyfriend?
Tell me, tell me *

38:45.757 --> 38:46.758
* Do you want my autograph?

38:46.792 --> 38:47.893
I don't see her.

38:47.926 --> 38:49.995
She was there
just a minute ago.

38:50.996 --> 38:52.764
What are you looking at?

38:52.798 --> 38:55.033
Stars. Beat it.

38:57.002 --> 38:59.471
* Yeah, this is how we roll

38:59.505 --> 39:02.641
* The suburban pioneers

39:02.674 --> 39:03.942
[Payson] I don't know.

39:07.446 --> 39:10.348
- Hey, what took so long?!
- Are you OK?

39:10.382 --> 39:12.350
Yeah. Fine.

39:12.384 --> 39:14.520
So, where's Otis?

39:14.553 --> 39:19.491
There was no Otis. Only this.

39:22.828 --> 39:27.499
"This is as close as you Barbies
will ever get. Gotcha!"

39:28.800 --> 39:29.868
Are you sure you're OK?

39:29.901 --> 39:31.102
You disappeared
for a long time up there.

39:31.136 --> 39:33.004
I'm just bummed. That's all.

39:33.038 --> 39:36.408
Hey, Barbies, is this
what you're looking for?

39:37.576 --> 39:39.044
This isn't over.

39:39.077 --> 39:40.746
I'm counting on it.

39:49.855 --> 39:51.657
How is it that
I am a nutritionist

39:51.690 --> 39:53.425
and I can't get my
own husband to eat?

39:53.459 --> 39:55.761
I'm sorry, honey, I was
just watching something.

39:55.794 --> 39:57.563
Here, take a look at this.

40:09.174 --> 40:12.110
- Was that three rotations?
- It sure was.

40:12.143 --> 40:13.912
Has a girl ever
done that before?

40:13.945 --> 40:15.881
Not in competition.

40:15.914 --> 40:19.384
So, that makes this girl
pretty special, doesn't it?

40:19.417 --> 40:20.786
Yeah.

40:40.438 --> 40:41.573
Randall.

40:45.744 --> 40:47.112
Pack your things.

40:47.145 --> 40:50.582
There are rules in this town
against public vagrancy.

40:50.616 --> 40:53.084
You've got one week to show me
you're not wasting my time.

40:55.453 --> 40:56.722
All right,
come on.

40:56.755 --> 40:59.925
Meet me at the dorm.
You're moving on campus.

41:14.806 --> 41:17.442
Why did he call us here?

41:17.475 --> 41:19.077
It can't be good.

41:19.110 --> 41:20.211
It looks like
a tribal council.

41:21.880 --> 41:23.481
Are we being sent home?

41:27.252 --> 41:29.220
- [Payson clears throat]
- Ladies.

41:31.790 --> 41:34.760
One of the greatest challenges
in gymnastics

41:34.793 --> 41:39.197
is accepting that it's both
a team and an individual sport.

41:39.230 --> 41:41.499
Yes, you need your teammates.

41:41.533 --> 41:43.602
Yes, you're there
for each other.

41:43.635 --> 41:46.972
But you don't choose
your teammates. I do.

41:47.005 --> 41:51.476
Teammates who will propel you
forward, not hold you back.

41:51.509 --> 41:56.281
Not encourage you to take part
in dangerous scavenger hunts.

41:57.248 --> 41:59.851
You know, gold is
forged by fire.

41:59.885 --> 42:02.487
Well, the same could be said
of a gold-medal-winning team.

42:02.520 --> 42:05.523
I'm trying to build
that kind of team.

42:05.557 --> 42:08.226
But I can't do it as long
as the three of you cling
to your old one.

42:08.259 --> 42:13.531
So, tonight you will
say goodbye to your past.

42:13.565 --> 42:15.734
Take off your Rock jackets,
ladies.

42:18.036 --> 42:20.071
[unzipping]

42:30.616 --> 42:33.551
Now, toss them in the fire.

42:35.253 --> 42:36.254
No.

42:38.156 --> 42:42.160
Well, you do have a choice.

42:42.193 --> 42:43.862
You can burn your jackets...

42:45.631 --> 42:47.265
...or say goodbye
to your Olympic dreams.

43:08.119 --> 43:10.055
Ladies...

43:10.088 --> 43:11.857
...it's a new beginning
for all of us.

43:17.362 --> 43:20.866
Jordan... what are
you doing here?

43:22.033 --> 43:25.336
Jordan's your new teammate.
For the moment.

43:25.370 --> 43:27.973
You do know she's crazy?

43:28.006 --> 43:29.607
Mm-hm.

43:29.641 --> 43:32.010
She also has
a triple back dismount.
