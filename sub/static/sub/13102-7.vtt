[instrumental music]

00:06.417 --> 00:08.292
(Stephen)
Doctor's personal log.

00:08.375 --> 00:11.667
Every day brings us
something new at Babylon 5.

00:11.750 --> 00:13.667
Unfortunately, sometimes
it also brings along

00:13.750 --> 00:16.458
a new strain of bacteria
or a new virus.

00:16.542 --> 00:19.250
My job now is to catalog
all those possible infections

00:19.333 --> 00:21.083
for the new alliance
and compile a complete

00:21.167 --> 00:23.917
medical profile
on all the member races.

00:24.000 --> 00:27.583
It's gonna be a big job,
but I'm looking forward to it.

00:27.667 --> 00:30.208
Alright, now breathe in slowly.

00:31.667 --> 00:34.083
That's it.

00:34.167 --> 00:35.458
Nurse?

00:41.167 --> 00:43.208
Interesting.

00:43.292 --> 00:45.625
You know, one of the reasons
why I wanted to see you

00:45.708 --> 00:48.167
is that even though
your people are carrion-eaters

00:48.250 --> 00:51.958
so that you're constantly being
exposed to, uh, alien bacteria

00:52.042 --> 00:54.458
you seem almost impervious
to outside infection.

00:54.542 --> 00:58.292
Pak'Ma'Ra are chosen of God.

00:58.375 --> 01:00.167
Very special.

01:00.250 --> 01:02.500
We can eat of all the creatures

01:02.583 --> 01:05.583
who walk and fly and crawl.

01:05.667 --> 01:08.583
But not of the fish in the sea.

01:08.667 --> 01:11.458
So you can handle
mammals of all kind

01:11.542 --> 01:14.000
even reptiles, but no fish.

01:14.083 --> 01:15.750
Interesting.

01:15.833 --> 01:18.625
Your system may be set up
to destroy harmful bacteria

01:18.708 --> 01:20.250
on a selective basis.

01:20.333 --> 01:23.417
'I'd like to do an analysis of
your upper intestinal system.'

01:23.500 --> 01:24.833
'This..'

01:24.917 --> 01:26.917
...is a barium compound.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.167
It's perfectly harmless.

01:28.250 --> 01:29.875
It'll help me track

01:29.958 --> 01:32.958
how your system
handles outside material.

01:33.042 --> 01:35.125
Not on approved list.

01:36.625 --> 01:39.083
Well, everything you eat doesn't
have to be dead for five days.

01:39.167 --> 01:42.083
Alright, this is
a non-organic compound

01:42.167 --> 01:43.917
and it does not fall
in the same category.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.708
So don't worry, now.
You'll be fine.

01:45.792 --> 01:47.833
We do this all the time. Here.

01:49.333 --> 01:51.500
Can you help him here, please?

01:51.583 --> 01:53.458
[instrumental music]

01:54.958 --> 01:57.667
So far everyone has been
extremely cooperative.

01:57.750 --> 01:59.250
Even the Pak'Ma'Ra.

01:59.333 --> 02:01.292
It goes a long way toward
restoring my faith

02:01.375 --> 02:04.292
in Babylon 5's mission.

02:04.375 --> 02:06.833
Alright, you ready?

02:06.917 --> 02:08.750
[belching]

02:08.833 --> 02:10.542
That's why we're all here.

02:10.625 --> 02:12.292
To better understand
one another

02:12.375 --> 02:15.875
and treat each other
with sympathy and compassion.

02:15.958 --> 02:19.250
Commodities which are all
too often in short supply.

02:21.708 --> 02:23.875
Okay, what's the problem?

02:23.958 --> 02:25.292
Travel violation.

02:25.375 --> 02:27.833
They don't have any money,
any transit papers.

02:27.917 --> 02:29.542
Half of them don't even
have any current ID.

02:29.625 --> 02:32.042
We are with-with-with Byron.

02:32.125 --> 02:35.208
We were told we could
c-c-c-come here.

02:35.292 --> 02:37.542
More telepaths. Great.

02:37.625 --> 02:40.417
This is not the right...p-place?

02:40.500 --> 02:42.417
This is where
we are-we are gathering.

02:42.500 --> 02:43.750
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
it's the right place.

02:43.833 --> 02:45.125
But this is getting out of hand.

02:45.208 --> 02:47.333
How many more of you
people are coming here?

02:47.417 --> 02:50.333
(Byron)
'How many angels can dance
on the head of a pin?'

02:51.833 --> 02:54.792
That question baffled religious
thinkers for centuries.

02:54.875 --> 02:57.375
Until someone finally
hit upon the answer.

02:57.458 --> 02:59.875
How many angels can dance
on the head of a pin?

02:59.958 --> 03:01.542
As many as want to.

03:01.625 --> 03:04.625
How many of my brother
and sister telepaths are coming?

03:04.708 --> 03:06.208
As many as want to.

03:06.292 --> 03:08.458
Yeah, well, captain--

03:08.542 --> 03:10.667
Is under orders
from President Sheridan

03:10.750 --> 03:12.083
to allow us in.

03:12.167 --> 03:14.042
As with all the rest
who have already arrived

03:14.125 --> 03:16.583
we will provide you with all
the paperwork you require

03:16.667 --> 03:18.083
for our friends here.

03:18.167 --> 03:20.208
You have my word.

03:22.167 --> 03:24.125
Alright. Go on.

03:24.208 --> 03:27.125
Come on. Move! Go! Go!

03:27.958 --> 03:28.917
[sighs]

03:29.042 --> 03:30.208
Lyta..

03:30.292 --> 03:32.500
...can I talk to you
for a minute, please?

03:34.083 --> 03:36.625
Those guys are gonna be trouble
yet. You just watch and see.

03:36.708 --> 03:39.500
There's more going on here
than they're telling us.

03:42.458 --> 03:45.542
[instrumental music]

03:53.375 --> 03:55.083
It's good to see you
again, Peter.

03:55.167 --> 03:58.125
And you, B-Byron.

03:58.208 --> 04:00.292
I've been p-p-practicing

04:00.375 --> 04:03.458
a great deal since
I s-saw you last.

04:03.542 --> 04:06.042
I'm much better now.

04:06.125 --> 04:08.125
S-stronger.

04:09.708 --> 04:11.958
Would-would you like to see?

04:12.042 --> 04:14.333
Of course, Peter. Show me.

04:16.750 --> 04:19.792
[music continues]

04:28.958 --> 04:30.750
[laughing]

04:30.833 --> 04:32.542
That was very good, Peter.

04:32.625 --> 04:34.042
Very, very good.

04:38.125 --> 04:39.875
(Kosh)
And so it begins.

04:39.958 --> 04:42.417
There's a hole in your mind.
What do you want?

04:42.500 --> 04:45.083
(G'Kar)
No one here is
exactly what he appears.

04:45.167 --> 04:46.958
(Sinclair)
Nothing's the same anymore.

04:47.042 --> 04:48.792
(Hague)
Commander Sinclair
is being reassigned.

04:48.875 --> 04:50.500
Why don't you eliminate
the entire Narn homeworld?

04:50.583 --> 04:53.625
I see a great hand
reaching out of the stars.

04:53.708 --> 04:55.375
(Sebastian)
Who are you?

04:55.458 --> 04:57.625
President Clark has signed
a decree today declaring..

04:57.708 --> 05:00.333
(Sheridan)
These orders have forced us
to declare independence..

05:00.417 --> 05:02.958
Unless your people get of their
encounter suited butts and do..

05:03.042 --> 05:04.583
(Zathras)
You're the one who was.

05:04.667 --> 05:07.542
(Kosh)
If you go to
Z'Ha'Dum, you will die.

05:07.625 --> 05:09.042
(Lorien)
Why are you here?

05:09.125 --> 05:11.083
Do you have anything
worth living for?

05:11.167 --> 05:12.625
(Delenn)
I think of my beautiful
city in flames.

05:12.708 --> 05:14.125
(Sheridan)
Giants in the playground.

05:14.208 --> 05:15.875
Now, get the hell
out of our galaxy!

05:15.958 --> 05:18.542
We are here to place
President Clark under arrest.

05:21.792 --> 05:24.833
[theme music]

05:54.833 --> 05:57.917
[music continues]

06:10.708 --> 06:12.833
I know you're busy, but,
uh, this won't take long.

06:12.917 --> 06:15.250
No, it's fine, Zack.
What can I do for you?

06:20.958 --> 06:23.708
What the hell are you
doing with those people?

06:23.792 --> 06:25.417
What? What people?

06:25.500 --> 06:28.208
Byron, the others.

06:28.292 --> 06:31.458
Those...people.

06:31.542 --> 06:34.417
Those people
are telepaths, same as me.

06:34.500 --> 06:36.583
Oh, no, not the same.

06:36.667 --> 06:39.292
The way they hang
together like that, I just..

06:39.375 --> 06:40.583
I don't like it.

06:40.667 --> 06:42.875
And that Byron guy's
the worst of the bunch.

06:42.958 --> 06:45.750
Byron is a sweet,
charming, sympathetic man

06:45.833 --> 06:47.625
who's trying to create
a better world.

06:47.708 --> 06:48.875
He's trouble and I don't think

06:48.958 --> 06:50.542
you should be
seeing him anymore.

06:50.625 --> 06:52.250
Who said I was seeing him?

06:52.333 --> 06:55.125
Lyta, I'm head of security.
I don't miss much.

06:55.208 --> 06:56.958
So you've been spying on me?

06:57.042 --> 06:59.125
I didn't say that.

06:59.208 --> 07:02.083
- You're jealous.
- No, I am not jealous.

07:02.167 --> 07:06.958
No? Care to give me permission
to peek inside and find out?

07:07.042 --> 07:09.875
- You don't understand.
- No, I understand, Zack.

07:09.958 --> 07:11.583
I understand plenty.

07:11.667 --> 07:12.833
You and the others
needed my help

07:12.917 --> 07:14.500
during the Shadow war,
and I did that.

07:14.583 --> 07:16.917
I put my life on the line.
And what did I get?

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
You were gonna boot me
into smaller quarters

07:19.083 --> 07:21.292
because I couldn't
afford anything better?

07:22.750 --> 07:25.125
The only way I got out of that
was to rejoin the Psi-Corps

07:25.208 --> 07:26.292
and you don't even wanna
know the deal

07:26.375 --> 07:27.542
I had to make
to pull that one off.

07:27.625 --> 07:30.208
- Lyta--
- I'm not finished.

07:30.292 --> 07:32.083
After all that,
you had the nerve

07:32.167 --> 07:34.000
to ask me
to risk my life a second time

07:34.083 --> 07:35.167
during the civil war back home.

07:35.250 --> 07:37.625
And stupid me, I did it.

07:37.708 --> 07:39.375
And what did I get out of that?

07:39.458 --> 07:41.500
zip, zilch.

07:41.583 --> 07:44.083
I got no life,
no hope, no prospects.

07:44.167 --> 07:46.542
Now, along comes Byron.

07:46.625 --> 07:49.042
And for the first time in a long
while, I feel like someone

07:49.125 --> 07:51.750
actually cares about
what happens to me.

07:51.833 --> 07:54.417
I care what happens
to you, Lyta.

07:54.500 --> 07:56.958
Yeah, well, maybe that's true.

07:57.042 --> 07:59.500
But talk is cheap, Zack.

07:59.583 --> 08:01.333
Byron is putting
his life on the line

08:01.417 --> 08:04.167
to create something
for his people.

08:04.250 --> 08:06.292
And I'm one of 'em.

08:06.375 --> 08:07.542
He's given us back

08:07.625 --> 08:10.708
a sense of dignity..

08:10.792 --> 08:13.542
...and community.

08:13.625 --> 08:15.833
I'm proud of that
and I'm proud of him.

08:17.667 --> 08:19.042
If you can't handle
that, I'm sorry

08:19.125 --> 08:20.708
but there's nothing
I can do about it.

08:20.792 --> 08:22.667
Look..

08:22.750 --> 08:24.375
...if you could just
give me five minutes--

08:24.458 --> 08:26.542
Zack..

08:26.625 --> 08:28.583
...if Byron asked me

08:28.667 --> 08:31.000
to follow him into hell..

08:31.083 --> 08:34.333
...I'd do it gladly
with a smile on my face.

08:34.417 --> 08:36.333
Because I believe in him.

08:37.500 --> 08:39.417
What could you possibly
say in five minutes

08:39.500 --> 08:41.583
that would change that?

08:45.250 --> 08:47.375
[instrumental music]

08:55.375 --> 08:56.750
Here they come again.

08:56.833 --> 08:58.792
Look just like crows,
don't they? All in black.

08:58.875 --> 09:01.000
What happened? Somebody die?

09:02.417 --> 09:04.958
Hey, I'm talking to you.

09:05.042 --> 09:07.958
Obviously, but I was
not talking to you.

09:08.042 --> 09:10.667
We were just passing through
and wish to continue.

09:10.750 --> 09:13.000
Well, I don't wish
you to continue.

09:13.083 --> 09:15.458
Who the hell do you think
you're talking to?

09:15.542 --> 09:17.125
You think you're
a big shot, don't you?

09:17.208 --> 09:19.792
All of you damn teeps,
you come down here

09:19.875 --> 09:21.500
parade around like
you're in charge of the place.

09:21.583 --> 09:23.750
Get free room and board and
you think you're better than us?

09:23.833 --> 09:26.333
The president has
allowed us to stay here.

09:26.417 --> 09:28.542
Yeah? Big fragging deal.

09:28.625 --> 09:29.792
I been here two years

09:29.875 --> 09:31.458
and let me tell you,
it ain't no honor.

09:31.542 --> 09:33.792
It's a joke, and so are you.

09:33.875 --> 09:37.042
Fine. You've had your say.
I'd like to pass now.

09:37.125 --> 09:39.125
I'd like to kick your ass.
What do you think of that?

09:39.208 --> 09:41.167
- It's okay. Let him come.
- No.

09:42.458 --> 09:43.875
Hit me.

09:46.250 --> 09:48.583
- What?
- I said, hit me!

09:48.667 --> 09:50.083
[intense music]

09:54.083 --> 09:56.042
Again.

10:03.875 --> 10:06.167
Again.

10:17.208 --> 10:19.625
[sighs]

10:19.708 --> 10:22.375
Was one the same as three?

10:22.458 --> 10:24.833
Was three the same
as one and two?

10:24.917 --> 10:26.167
What?

10:26.250 --> 10:28.958
Was there any difference
between one, two and three?

10:30.958 --> 10:33.333
And what would you expect to get
out of four, five and six

10:33.417 --> 10:36.583
that you did not get
out of one, two and three?

10:41.458 --> 10:44.333
Your anger has
nothing to do with me.

10:44.417 --> 10:46.833
What will satisfy your anger
will never come from me

10:46.917 --> 10:48.917
or anyone else here.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
I'm afraid you must
look for it elsewhere.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.833
[instrumental music]

11:06.458 --> 11:08.958
Nothing! It was nothing.

11:10.667 --> 11:13.500
Must have been
some kind of teep trick.

11:14.333 --> 11:15.875
Come on!

11:18.958 --> 11:21.667
I appreciate you
seeing me, ambassador.

11:21.750 --> 11:24.000
I did nothing
but relay your request

11:24.083 --> 11:25.750
to the Grand Council of Elders.

11:25.833 --> 11:29.375
The Ssh-Ba himself
approved your request.

11:29.458 --> 11:30.875
The Ssh-Ba?

11:30.958 --> 11:34.292
Doesn't that translate
to "oldest of the old?"

11:34.375 --> 11:37.125
Yes, we were geritocracy

11:37.208 --> 11:39.083
ruled by the oldest
of our people

11:39.167 --> 11:41.375
who are wise enough
to guide us properly.

11:41.458 --> 11:42.917
We..

11:44.500 --> 11:47.458
Ah, there you are.

11:47.542 --> 11:50.792
Doctor, this is
my attachÃ©, Kirrin.

11:50.875 --> 11:52.458
My apologies for being late.

11:52.542 --> 11:54.000
Forgiven. Please sit.

11:55.417 --> 11:58.542
The doctor was just explaining
what he needs from us.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.083
Well, it-it-it's nothing major.

12:02.167 --> 12:04.208
At least at this stage.

12:05.583 --> 12:07.917
We would like access
to your genetic records

12:08.000 --> 12:09.292
'and medical files
so that we could better'

12:09.375 --> 12:11.833
understand your people
and any dangers

12:11.917 --> 12:15.250
that might come to us
or to you from other species.

12:15.333 --> 12:17.458
Until now, we have kept

12:17.542 --> 12:20.042
our medical information
to ourselves

12:20.125 --> 12:22.875
to prevent others
from using it against us.

12:22.958 --> 12:25.125
We've never given it
to an outsider.

12:25.208 --> 12:26.667
I appreciate that.

12:26.750 --> 12:27.958
You have my personal guarantee

12:28.042 --> 12:29.917
that nothing
of a compromising nature

12:30.000 --> 12:31.500
will ever be released.

12:31.583 --> 12:34.833
As a doctor, I'm bound
by an oath of confidentiality.

12:34.917 --> 12:36.208
So whatever you give me

12:36.292 --> 12:38.792
will be considered
privileged information.

12:38.875 --> 12:41.458
And if you are
captured by another

12:41.542 --> 12:44.708
and given the choice
of betraying us or dying

12:44.792 --> 12:45.750
which would you choose?

12:45.833 --> 12:48.917
- Kirrin!
- My apologies.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.500
But it is a fair question.

12:51.583 --> 12:54.708
He is asking us to risk
our lives on his promise.

12:54.792 --> 12:57.208
Is it wrong to ask
the same of him?

13:00.750 --> 13:03.375
All the information
will be kept in one file.

13:03.458 --> 13:05.500
Triple encoded
and there are no copies.

13:05.583 --> 13:07.417
No one else has the pass code.

13:07.500 --> 13:10.375
If anyone enters
the wrong code, just once

13:10.458 --> 13:12.333
the program will delete itself.

13:12.417 --> 13:15.167
But if someone placed
a gun to your head

13:15.250 --> 13:17.875
and told you
to give me the pass code

13:17.958 --> 13:19.750
would you die for us?

13:19.833 --> 13:22.792
You aren't asking anything that
I haven't already considered

13:22.875 --> 13:25.042
and the answer is yes.

13:25.125 --> 13:27.292
I would die before
I allow my work

13:27.375 --> 13:30.000
to be used
in biogenetic warfare.

13:30.083 --> 13:32.375
Anything else, Kirrin?

13:32.458 --> 13:35.125
No. Thank you, doctor.

13:39.625 --> 13:42.542
I will arrange to have as many
of our medical files as possible

13:42.625 --> 13:44.333
transferred to your system.

13:44.417 --> 13:45.750
The material should be there

13:45.833 --> 13:47.750
by the time
you get back to Medlab.

13:48.625 --> 13:50.875
Thank you, ambassador.

13:53.417 --> 13:54.708
Kirrin.

14:00.292 --> 14:02.125
This is a mistake.

14:02.208 --> 14:03.792
The Elders have spoken.

14:03.875 --> 14:07.542
It is not your place
to question them or me.

14:07.625 --> 14:09.208
This information is required

14:09.292 --> 14:12.458
if we are to remain
part of the alliance.

14:12.542 --> 14:15.083
And our people need that edge

14:15.167 --> 14:17.167
if we are to compete.

14:17.250 --> 14:19.792
But what if he finds out?

14:19.875 --> 14:22.875
If it is the will of Oshi-Ta..

14:24.042 --> 14:26.125
...then we must accept it.

14:28.750 --> 14:31.833
[instrumental music]

14:33.417 --> 14:35.375
And if he betrays us..

14:36.500 --> 14:38.542
...then he will die.

14:45.500 --> 14:47.667
Oh, God.

14:47.750 --> 14:50.708
- 'Are you alright?'
- Fine.

14:50.792 --> 14:52.542
Yeah, you look fine.

14:53.708 --> 14:56.042
Why isn't somebody
taking care of you?

14:56.125 --> 14:57.958
Because they understand
at times like this

14:58.042 --> 15:00.042
I prefer not to be disturbed.

15:01.333 --> 15:03.208
Just a minute.

15:05.583 --> 15:08.292
(Lyta)
'Now, I heard about
what happened.'

15:08.375 --> 15:11.292
There were as many of you
as there were of them.

15:11.375 --> 15:12.708
So why did you let them
do that to you?

15:12.792 --> 15:14.250
Because then there
would have been

15:14.333 --> 15:16.833
seven of our people hurt
instead of just one.

15:16.917 --> 15:19.000
Violence is not our way, Lyta.

15:19.083 --> 15:21.125
Yeah, well..

15:21.208 --> 15:23.125
...at times like this,
it is mine.

15:23.208 --> 15:24.667
No.

15:24.750 --> 15:26.667
Violence is their way.

15:26.750 --> 15:28.042
The way of the mundanes

15:28.125 --> 15:30.458
who would use us, control us
and in the end, kill us

15:30.542 --> 15:33.292
because they're afraid of us.

15:33.375 --> 15:34.833
The Psi-Corps has
adopted their ways.

15:34.917 --> 15:37.000
Treating us
as the mundanes treat them

15:37.083 --> 15:39.917
because they're afraid
of themselves..

15:40.000 --> 15:42.833
...and because they don't
know any other way.

15:42.917 --> 15:44.750
They don't understand.

15:44.833 --> 15:47.083
Understand what?

15:47.167 --> 15:50.000
No tyranny has
ever really lasted.

15:50.083 --> 15:52.000
No government based
on violence has endured.

15:52.083 --> 15:55.000
Sooner or later, they all fall.

15:55.083 --> 15:57.833
We're here to build
a new life for ourselves.

15:57.917 --> 15:59.875
A home among the stars.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.708
Would you build
a home on a foundation

16:01.792 --> 16:03.083
you knew would not last?

16:03.167 --> 16:04.208
No, of course not.

16:04.292 --> 16:05.958
Then why should we
use the same tools

16:06.042 --> 16:07.583
of violence and fear
that they use?

16:07.667 --> 16:09.125
But when they do this

16:09.208 --> 16:10.750
doesn't it, doesn't it
make you mad?

16:10.833 --> 16:13.375
I mean, don't you wanna
strike back? Cou.. Ju-ju..

16:13.458 --> 16:16.458
What? What's so funny?

16:16.542 --> 16:18.792
Do you know what you are?

16:18.875 --> 16:20.292
What?

16:20.375 --> 16:22.875
A BCFMO.

16:22.958 --> 16:26.208
A brightly colored
fast moving object.

16:26.292 --> 16:27.667
You don't just walk into a room.

16:27.750 --> 16:30.083
You blaze in and blaze out
again like a comet.

16:33.458 --> 16:36.458
There's so much more to you
than meets the eye.

16:38.417 --> 16:40.667
If you only knew.

16:43.167 --> 16:46.000
- Stop smiling.
- Then go away.

16:46.083 --> 16:48.167
If you're here, I'm afraid
I can't help myself.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.250
Oh.

16:52.875 --> 16:56.125
What am I gonna do with you?

16:56.208 --> 16:58.375
I sometimes wonder
the same thing about you.

17:00.042 --> 17:02.250
Well, when you
figure it out, let me know.

17:03.833 --> 17:05.958
You first.

17:07.208 --> 17:10.292
[instrumental music]

17:27.583 --> 17:29.292
I'll, uh..

17:30.375 --> 17:31.917
...I'll go to see Dr. Franklin

17:32.000 --> 17:34.583
and get something
for your bruises.

17:34.667 --> 17:37.042
Should make them
go away by tomorrow.

17:37.125 --> 17:39.083
They're already gone.

17:39.167 --> 17:41.333
I can still see them.

17:41.417 --> 17:43.708
Only on the outside.

17:48.375 --> 17:51.125
Well, I should go.

17:51.208 --> 17:54.125
You leave us every night. Why?

17:55.500 --> 17:58.292
I-I don't feel like
I belong here.

17:58.375 --> 18:00.958
Not yet anyway.

18:01.042 --> 18:03.000
Yes, you do.

18:03.083 --> 18:05.333
Stay with us tonight.

18:07.542 --> 18:08.958
No, I-I can't, Byron.

18:09.042 --> 18:11.375
I-I want to, but..

18:18.292 --> 18:21.375
[music continues]

18:23.917 --> 18:27.375
Lyta does not yet feel
she truly belongs among us.

18:28.750 --> 18:31.000
What do you say?

18:51.958 --> 18:53.750
[music continues]

18:59.833 --> 19:02.167
[door opens]

19:04.792 --> 19:07.417
These are the last of
the files you wanted, doctor.

19:07.500 --> 19:09.542
Thank you. Just-just, uh,
set them down right there.

19:09.625 --> 19:11.208
Thank you very much.

19:11.292 --> 19:12.792
Kirrin?

19:12.875 --> 19:14.917
There's something I don't
understand about these records.

19:15.000 --> 19:18.125
Now, your civilization
has been around for 7000 years.

19:18.208 --> 19:21.625
But-but these files on your
evolution and medical history

19:21.708 --> 19:23.958
only go back about 800 years.

19:24.042 --> 19:25.542
Yes?

19:25.625 --> 19:27.833
Well, it would be helpful
if I had something

19:27.917 --> 19:29.417
a little more comprehensive.

19:29.500 --> 19:30.875
All the conclusions and results

19:30.958 --> 19:32.958
of the previous years are there.

19:33.042 --> 19:34.833
Are they not?

19:34.917 --> 19:38.083
Yes, but it's important
to know the historical process

19:38.167 --> 19:39.375
that led to those conclusions.

19:39.458 --> 19:41.250
- Now, if I could just--
- I'm sorry, doctor.

19:41.333 --> 19:44.000
Those are all
the files I was given.

19:44.083 --> 19:46.250
You will have to make do
with what you have.

19:48.042 --> 19:51.125
[instrumental music]

19:55.083 --> 19:57.458
Computer, check Hyach
historical archives.

19:57.542 --> 19:58.833
How far back do we have records

19:58.917 --> 20:01.083
of their society their culture,
their government?

20:01.167 --> 20:03.125
(female automated announcer)
'Checking, records date back'

20:03.208 --> 20:06.958
'between 750 years
and 820 years.'

20:07.042 --> 20:08.250
That's it?

20:08.333 --> 20:10.500
There is no recorded
history of the Hyach

20:10.583 --> 20:12.083
before about 800 years?

20:12.167 --> 20:14.000
'Confirmed.'

20:15.833 --> 20:18.458
They're hiding something.

20:18.542 --> 20:20.208
But what?

20:21.625 --> 20:24.208
More important, why?

20:34.542 --> 20:36.833
[music continues]

20:45.750 --> 20:48.042
You-you go on ahead.
I'll-I'll catch up.

21:40.250 --> 21:42.750
What the hell are you
doing down here, freak?

21:43.625 --> 21:45.375
I was ju-I was ju..

21:45.458 --> 21:46.583
"I was ju.."

21:46.667 --> 21:48.708
He was ju-he was ju..

21:48.792 --> 21:50.750
Hey, you brought lunch.
Let me see.

21:50.833 --> 21:53.042
Let me see!

21:58.208 --> 22:00.250
[dramatic music]

22:03.250 --> 22:05.708
'What are you
looking at, freak?'

22:05.792 --> 22:07.708
I said, what are you loo..

22:09.750 --> 22:11.792
'Oh, look out!'

22:12.292 --> 22:13.333
Ow!

22:16.333 --> 22:18.542
You think that's funny,
huh, freak?

22:18.625 --> 22:21.375
I'll show you what's funny.

22:21.458 --> 22:24.042
- Take it easy. Easy.
- Get on! I'm gonna do it!

22:27.667 --> 22:29.708
[grunting]

22:38.167 --> 22:39.292
(Stephen)
'Alright, people,
let's move now, let's move.'

22:39.375 --> 22:40.458
'Fifty CCs of hydromorphozine.'

22:40.542 --> 22:41.625
'IV, stat.'

22:41.708 --> 22:43.208
'Let's get the scanners
on him quick!'

22:43.292 --> 22:45.500
'Let's move, people.
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!'

22:45.583 --> 22:47.917
Bring it on in!

22:48.000 --> 22:50.375
(male #1)
'Breathing is
erratic. Analyzing.'

22:50.458 --> 22:51.625
- How is he?
- Not good.

22:51.708 --> 22:53.625
- Oh.
- But I think he'll live.

22:53.708 --> 22:55.208
Why aren't you working on him?

22:55.292 --> 22:57.875
I've got my best trauma team
handling his case.

22:57.958 --> 22:59.792
Alright? If they
can't handle it, nobody can.

22:59.875 --> 23:01.458
Now, do you know what happened?

23:01.542 --> 23:03.750
Yes, he was attacked
by one of you

23:03.833 --> 23:07.167
for the crime of being
who he is and what he is.

23:07.250 --> 23:09.083
Alright, did you get
a description of who did this?

23:09.167 --> 23:12.000
No, but I believe
we know who was responsible.

23:12.083 --> 23:13.875
Well, we're gonna need more
than that to go after him.

23:13.958 --> 23:16.958
My people won't.
That troubles me.

23:19.583 --> 23:21.375
They're not gonna do
anything stupid now, are they?

23:21.458 --> 23:24.042
Well, not if
Byron can stop them.

23:24.125 --> 23:27.167
Well, if they're so upset,
where are they?

23:27.250 --> 23:28.792
They're here.

23:30.583 --> 23:32.167
(Stephen)
'Has his breathing improved?'

23:32.250 --> 23:34.875
(male #1)
'Slightly, but it's
still erratic.'

23:37.208 --> 23:41.417
(female #1)
'Uh, 20 CCs of diodram.'

23:41.500 --> 23:42.667
(Stephen)
'Wait a minute.'

23:42.750 --> 23:45.000
'There's a flutter
on the brain scan.'

23:46.083 --> 23:47.792
(Byron)
'Doctor!'

23:50.292 --> 23:51.583
Take good care of him.

23:51.667 --> 23:54.250
He's a very special case.

23:54.333 --> 23:56.000
(male #1)
'He's now responsive.'

23:56.083 --> 23:58.833
(Stephen)
'Good. Just watch him.
He may go into shock.'

23:58.917 --> 24:01.583
- 'What the hell?'
- 'Watch it!'

24:03.708 --> 24:06.708
As I said,
a very special case.

24:10.083 --> 24:12.208
Come on. We have to hurry.

24:16.500 --> 24:18.708
[grunting]

24:18.792 --> 24:20.917
No!

24:22.292 --> 24:25.417
'Aah. No. No more.'

24:25.500 --> 24:27.250
'I didn't do anything!'

24:27.333 --> 24:29.708
[screaming]

24:29.792 --> 24:32.625
Make it stop!
Make it stop!

24:32.708 --> 24:34.375
Make it stop!

24:34.458 --> 24:36.375
[grunting]

24:36.458 --> 24:38.708
I didn't do anything!

24:38.792 --> 24:40.208
[screaming]

24:48.125 --> 24:50.833
'Make it stop.
Make it stop!'

24:53.208 --> 24:54.375
It's me.

24:54.458 --> 24:56.375
It's me!

24:56.458 --> 24:59.083
Be still. Let it go.

24:59.958 --> 25:01.625
Do it for me.

25:18.750 --> 25:19.792
Byron.

25:19.875 --> 25:21.833
Freeze!

25:21.917 --> 25:25.417
- Hold it right there.
- Zack, stop.

25:25.500 --> 25:28.750
Let him go. Listen to me.
He didn't do anything.

25:28.833 --> 25:31.417
Yeah? Doesn't look
that way to me.

25:31.500 --> 25:33.917
It's alright, Lyta.
It's alright.

25:35.667 --> 25:37.875
Alright. Get him out of here.

25:39.500 --> 25:42.083
Get a med team down here, stat.

25:49.042 --> 25:51.125
Computer..

25:51.208 --> 25:55.292
...anything new on the search
for Hyach records?

25:55.375 --> 25:57.417
'Negative results on search.'

25:57.500 --> 25:58.708
[sighs]

25:58.792 --> 25:59.917
Alright. Alright.

26:00.000 --> 26:03.000
Let's-let's
try this another way.

26:03.083 --> 26:05.625
Uh..

26:05.708 --> 26:07.125
...search all available files

26:07.208 --> 26:09.958
for any records
from any of the other races.

26:10.042 --> 26:11.458
Some of them
have been in contact

26:11.542 --> 26:12.917
with the Hyach for a long time.

26:13.000 --> 26:14.792
Maybe they've got
something we don't.

26:14.875 --> 26:15.958
'Stand by.'

26:16.042 --> 26:18.042
[beeping]

26:23.375 --> 26:24.458
[beeping]

26:24.542 --> 26:27.750
- 'Yeah?'
- I-I need to see my people.

26:27.833 --> 26:30.500
- Mr. Alan promised--
- 'First thing in the morning.'

26:30.583 --> 26:33.542
This can't wait. I need
to talk to them, calm them down.

26:33.625 --> 26:34.792
If I don't speak to them

26:34.875 --> 26:36.750
something terribly wrong
is going to happen.

26:36.833 --> 26:38.500
(male #2)
'Yeah, yeah. Whatever.'

26:38.583 --> 26:39.667

'Records found.'

27:12.542 --> 27:14.750
Hmm. Oh.

27:14.833 --> 27:16.875
Alrighty.

27:17.917 --> 27:19.708
Let's see what we got here.

27:19.792 --> 27:21.208

Initiate translation program.

27:23.500 --> 27:25.250
[computer beeping]

27:25.333 --> 27:28.042
Picked up another
shipment of Kiligrain

27:28.125 --> 27:30.208
for dark moon ceremony.

27:30.292 --> 27:32.417
We had a sighting of Hyach-Doh.

27:32.500 --> 27:33.917
'Very rare.'

27:34.000 --> 27:37.292
'Came into our encampment
and asked to come with us.'

27:37.375 --> 27:39.250
'Per our contract, we refused'

27:39.333 --> 27:42.042
'and notified those
in charge of collection.'

27:42.125 --> 27:44.875
'Expect to arrive
in homeland in 24--'

27:44.958 --> 27:47.167
Stop!

27:47.250 --> 27:50.917
We had a sighting of Hyach-Doh.
Very rare.

27:51.000 --> 27:54.167
'Came into our encampment
and asked to come with us.'

27:54.250 --> 27:56.208
'Per our contract, we refused'

27:56.292 --> 28:00.250
'and notified those
in charge of collection.'

28:00.333 --> 28:02.167
[beeps]

28:03.833 --> 28:06.083
Computer, is there any
reference to Hyach-Doh

28:06.167 --> 28:10.042
in any of the current
Hyach literature?

28:10.125 --> 28:12.375
(female automated announcer)
'Negative.'

28:12.458 --> 28:15.000
Alright, check alien records.

28:15.083 --> 28:17.750
Cross reference with Hyach-Doh.

28:17.833 --> 28:20.500
Include all variant spellings.
Give me a hard copy readout.

28:20.583 --> 28:22.208
'Stand by.'

28:24.667 --> 28:26.417
[instrumental music]

28:56.417 --> 28:59.292
Do as I tell you or die.

29:05.875 --> 29:07.708
Stop!

29:07.792 --> 29:09.292
Far enough.

29:09.375 --> 29:12.667
Let me see.

29:12.750 --> 29:15.333
(Stephen)
I can save you time, Kirrin.

29:15.417 --> 29:18.417
I know your secret.

29:18.500 --> 29:21.375
The Hyach-Doh, they're
all dead, aren't they?

29:21.458 --> 29:24.333
'It was a case
of parallel evolution.'

29:24.417 --> 29:27.875
Two sentient races
developed on your world.

29:27.958 --> 29:30.292
The other race splitting off
from the main line

29:30.375 --> 29:31.542
about a million years ago.

29:31.625 --> 29:34.250
Like the Neanderthal
and Cro-Magnon on Earth.

29:34.333 --> 29:37.208
Except in your case..

29:37.292 --> 29:38.875
...they didn't die out.

29:38.958 --> 29:40.167
Yes.

29:40.250 --> 29:43.042
At first, we competed
for living space.

29:43.125 --> 29:44.833
Resources.

29:44.917 --> 29:47.542
Then we learned
to live together..

29:47.625 --> 29:49.292
...for a time.

29:49.375 --> 29:50.833
And all the while

29:50.917 --> 29:53.833
there was intermarrying between
the two sides, wasn't there?

29:53.917 --> 29:55.542
It was a great scandal.

29:55.625 --> 29:58.208
But it continued
throughout our history.

29:58.292 --> 30:02.958
Until 1200
of your years ago.

30:03.042 --> 30:06.208
Religious laws were passed
that made it immoral

30:06.292 --> 30:08.958
for one line
to marry into the other.

30:09.042 --> 30:13.583
Then immoral became illegal.

30:13.667 --> 30:17.042
Then illegal,
punishable by death.

30:17.125 --> 30:18.292
And then..

30:18.375 --> 30:20.750
And then it just became
more efficient for you

30:20.833 --> 30:22.833
to wipe out the entire race.

30:24.125 --> 30:26.958
It took us centuries.

30:27.042 --> 30:30.708
They were hunted down
in every corner of our world.

30:30.792 --> 30:34.042
There were bounties
placed on their heads.

30:34.125 --> 30:37.167
They were forbidden
to leave our homeland.

30:37.250 --> 30:38.917
They tried to slip away.

30:39.000 --> 30:41.708
But any captain found
transporting them

30:41.792 --> 30:45.500
was subject
to arrest and execution.

30:46.417 --> 30:48.625
Forty million of them.

30:48.708 --> 30:52.500
The funeral pyres
burned night and day.

30:52.583 --> 30:55.167
It was a long time ago.

30:55.250 --> 30:57.000
We are not responsible.

30:57.083 --> 30:59.958
But we pay the price, Kirrin.

31:00.042 --> 31:02.167
What price?

31:03.833 --> 31:07.000
Well, you must've known
I'd stumble onto this.

31:07.083 --> 31:08.917
What price?

31:10.583 --> 31:12.750
Give him back his papers.

31:15.500 --> 31:17.750
Do as I say.

31:24.500 --> 31:27.542
Take a look at the numbers
for our population growth.

31:31.167 --> 31:34.042
No. They're not growing.
They're shrinking.

31:36.792 --> 31:39.917
The birth rate
is down nearly 20%.

31:41.750 --> 31:44.375
Looks like it's been
decreasing steadily

31:44.458 --> 31:46.417
for centuries, but..

31:49.875 --> 31:53.417
Something in your biological
makeup is breaking down.

31:53.500 --> 31:55.542
Yes.

31:55.625 --> 31:58.667
You needed
the Hyach-Doh, didn't you?

31:58.750 --> 32:00.500
You needed
something in their DNA

32:00.583 --> 32:02.875
to keep your species growing
through interbreeding.

32:02.958 --> 32:05.208
- Without it--
- We are dying.

32:06.750 --> 32:09.250
We killed the Hyach-Doh

32:09.333 --> 32:12.667
and in so doing,
we killed ourselves.

32:12.750 --> 32:15.167
It took us a long time
to discover the cause

32:15.250 --> 32:19.542
but now, there is nowhere to go.

32:19.625 --> 32:21.667
We are a dying people.

32:21.750 --> 32:23.750
Unless you help us.

32:28.250 --> 32:29.833
No.

32:29.917 --> 32:32.417
You hold us responsible
for those who were killed.

32:32.500 --> 32:33.708
Yes.

32:33.792 --> 32:36.500
Even though we ourselves
were not yet born?

32:38.958 --> 32:40.917
You helped hide the truth
about what happened

32:41.042 --> 32:43.042
by revising your history.

32:43.125 --> 32:44.542
Cutting out the parts
you didn't like.

32:44.625 --> 32:45.958
Now, as far as I'm concerned

32:46.042 --> 32:48.292
that makes you
an accomplice after the fact.

32:48.375 --> 32:49.708
It's our shame.

32:49.792 --> 32:51.708
We won't have it exposed.

32:51.792 --> 32:54.042
Well, that's your choice.

32:54.125 --> 32:57.375
But what it means is,
morally, I can't help you.

32:57.458 --> 32:59.000
Besides, something
as massive as this

32:59.083 --> 33:00.583
it's beyond my capabilities.

33:00.667 --> 33:03.375
It would take the resources
of several league worlds

33:03.458 --> 33:04.958
to conduct studies
on your biology.

33:05.042 --> 33:06.708
Find out what was lost.

33:06.792 --> 33:10.375
Develop a means of restoring it
on a planetary basis.

33:10.458 --> 33:12.667
It's too big of a job
to be finished in my lifetime.

33:12.750 --> 33:14.833
But we could get started.

33:15.958 --> 33:18.625
It may not work.

33:18.708 --> 33:20.042
But if you keep this a secret

33:20.125 --> 33:21.542
nothing will be done.

33:21.625 --> 33:24.750
And your people, your race,
will eventually die out.

33:25.833 --> 33:28.000
Let him go.

33:29.667 --> 33:30.750
But, Tal..

33:30.833 --> 33:34.083
It is the decision
of the Elders.

33:34.167 --> 33:38.250
They could not
reveal our shame to others.

33:38.333 --> 33:42.250
But now that another
has discovered our truth

33:42.333 --> 33:45.417
we may as well acknowledge it.

33:45.500 --> 33:48.417
It is too high
a price to pay

33:48.500 --> 33:50.333
to do otherwise.

33:51.917 --> 33:54.000
[instrumental music]

34:01.500 --> 34:03.583
Perhaps..

34:03.667 --> 34:06.167
...someday..

34:06.250 --> 34:08.750
...you may forgive us
for what our ancestors did.

34:11.583 --> 34:13.667
I can't forgive you.

34:15.625 --> 34:19.667
It's not my place
to speak for the dead.

34:22.292 --> 34:24.917
The only forgiveness can come
from the Hyach-Doh.

34:27.458 --> 34:30.042
Too bad they're all dead.

34:35.708 --> 34:38.042
The guy that got attacked
woke up about an hour ago.

34:38.125 --> 34:39.833
Didn't remember
who did it to him.

34:39.917 --> 34:41.208
Only thing
he does seem to remember

34:41.292 --> 34:43.375
is you tried to help him.

34:43.458 --> 34:45.167
His story confirms
what you told us.

34:45.250 --> 34:48.917
- Then I can go now.
- You can go.

34:49.000 --> 34:52.250
Thing is, the guy
worked for Carl Townsend.

34:52.333 --> 34:53.958
Real pain in
the ass in down below.

34:54.042 --> 34:56.167
First class thug.

34:56.250 --> 34:59.833
My guys found Carl's body
about an hour ago.

34:59.917 --> 35:02.000
Not a pretty sight.

35:02.083 --> 35:04.458
No. I would imagine not.

35:05.875 --> 35:09.667
Word is, he and the other guy
who got attacked

35:09.750 --> 35:12.167
hassled your bunch
the other day.

35:12.250 --> 35:15.625
Maybe even attacked
one of your guys.

35:15.708 --> 35:18.292
Now one's in serious condition.

35:18.375 --> 35:20.833
The other's dead.

35:20.917 --> 35:23.250
Don't suppose you know
anything about that.

35:23.333 --> 35:26.000
How would I? I've been
in here the whole time.

35:38.125 --> 35:39.542
One thing.

35:39.625 --> 35:42.583
I suspect if you'd not
kept me locked up here all day

35:42.667 --> 35:45.708
there might be one less
dead body in your morgue.

35:45.792 --> 35:48.875
Please, try and remember
that next time.

Are you sure
you're gonna be alright?

36:23.500 --> 36:24.875
No.

36:27.042 --> 36:29.750
I worked so hard
to teach them, Lyta.

36:29.833 --> 36:32.000
I wanted so much
for them to understand.

36:33.292 --> 36:34.375
[sighs]

36:34.458 --> 36:36.500
And yet, they continue.

36:37.417 --> 36:39.792
They killed that man, Lyta.

36:40.875 --> 36:43.375
Not all of them.

36:43.458 --> 36:45.375
I don't know
which ones, but I..

36:46.708 --> 36:49.708
...I could feel it
when it happened.

36:51.667 --> 36:53.917
Through 14 decks..

36:54.000 --> 36:56.125
...layers of steel
and wire and doors

36:56.208 --> 36:58.250
I could feel it!

37:01.958 --> 37:04.000
And I was ashamed.

37:05.417 --> 37:06.667
It's not their fault.

37:06.750 --> 37:08.875
I should have taught
them better somehow.

37:10.375 --> 37:13.333
He was a violent,
dangerous man.

37:14.583 --> 37:16.125
Now, I-I can't
condone what they did

37:16.208 --> 37:18.125
but I understand it.

37:19.125 --> 37:21.625
You did everything you could.

37:21.708 --> 37:23.583
Then I must learn to do more.

37:23.667 --> 37:26.458
That's where you're wrong.

37:26.542 --> 37:28.208
You have done more
for these people

37:28.292 --> 37:30.417
than you will ever understand.

37:31.375 --> 37:33.625
And for me.

37:33.708 --> 37:36.167
I wish I could believe that.

37:36.250 --> 37:38.500
So do I.

37:38.583 --> 37:40.667
Because it's true.

37:51.167 --> 37:54.792
Five lifetimes ago,
you said I was your willow.

37:56.042 --> 37:58.958

37:59.042 --> 38:01.250
...and rest.

38:01.333 --> 38:02.875
Yes.

38:04.583 --> 38:06.625
Then rest in me.

for a little while.

[instrumental music]

38:34.083 --> 38:36.292
There's something
you should know before we..

I haven't been
with anyone since..

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
Byron, the Vorlons changed me.

38:51.958 --> 38:54.708
More than you could
possibly know.

38:54.792 --> 38:57.292
I-I don't know what it'll do
once you get past my barriers

38:57.375 --> 39:00.292
and I get past yours.

39:00.375 --> 39:02.375
It could burn you.

41:30.542 --> 41:33.583
- It was the Vorlons.
- Yes.

41:33.667 --> 41:36.917
They created telepaths
on a hundred worlds.

41:37.000 --> 41:39.667
Interfered with their
genetic development.

41:39.750 --> 41:41.167
Took people
from their home worlds

41:41.250 --> 41:43.333
and adjusted them over
the course of the centuries.

41:43.417 --> 41:44.792
Yes.

41:44.875 --> 41:48.417
Because they needed telepaths in
their war against the Shadows.

41:48.500 --> 41:50.750
Needed us as cannon fodder.

41:50.833 --> 41:52.583
Yes.

41:52.667 --> 41:55.000
We would be normal.

41:55.083 --> 41:57.625
We would have lives.

41:57.708 --> 41:59.792
We would be able
to walk and live

41:59.875 --> 42:02.917
and work among normals
without fear of persecution

42:03.000 --> 42:04.792
if the Vorlons
had not interfered

42:04.875 --> 42:07.208
with our normal development.

42:07.292 --> 42:09.250
We were made for their benefit.

42:09.333 --> 42:11.250
To save them.

42:11.333 --> 42:14.625
We were told that our abilities
were our gift and our curse.

42:14.708 --> 42:18.083
And that we were somehow
responsible for it.

42:18.167 --> 42:19.958
But we're not.

42:20.042 --> 42:21.917
We're not.

42:22.000 --> 42:23.750
The Vorlons are gone, Byron.

42:23.833 --> 42:26.333
There's no one left
to settle the score.

42:26.417 --> 42:29.542
No, but the other races
are still here.

42:29.625 --> 42:32.250
We were made telepathic
to serve their cause.

42:32.333 --> 42:33.917
Save their worlds.

42:34.000 --> 42:35.833
Now, they have
to recognize that.

42:35.917 --> 42:38.625
They have to understand that
they are responsible for us.

42:38.708 --> 42:39.833
For our condition.

42:39.917 --> 42:42.083
They have
to make it right, Lyta.

42:42.167 --> 42:44.583
We'll force them
to make it right.

42:44.667 --> 42:45.875
How?

42:45.958 --> 42:48.708
By giving us
a homeland of our own.

42:48.792 --> 42:50.958
We don't fit here
because we're different.

42:51.042 --> 42:53.750
Because we were made different.

42:53.833 --> 42:57.542
They owe us a place where
we can be among our own kind.

42:57.625 --> 42:59.292
We'll ask to speak
to the Alliance.

42:59.375 --> 43:00.792
Put our case before them.

43:00.875 --> 43:04.125
See if they can be persuaded
to do the right thing.

43:04.208 --> 43:06.417
And if they can't?

43:07.958 --> 43:10.042
[instrumental music]

43:18.125 --> 43:20.583
Then we'll make sure
they have no other choice.

43:33.375 --> 43:36.125
[theme music]
