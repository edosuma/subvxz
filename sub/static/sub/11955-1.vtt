00:27.561 --> 00:31.965
* I'll find a better life
For you *

00:31.999 --> 00:36.504
* The stars have said
Our love's untrue *

00:36.537 --> 00:40.908
* And just because
We shared a lie *

00:40.941 --> 00:46.814
* There is no reason
For a soul to die *

00:59.026 --> 01:03.531
* I've got a soul
And you broke my heart *

01:03.564 --> 01:07.935
* Find a new scene
And let us depart *

01:07.968 --> 01:14.475
* Don't hang around
And let yourself be
Caught in this *

01:23.551 --> 01:28.122
* You'll find a better
People there *

01:28.156 --> 01:32.793
* A friendly love
The kind who care *

01:32.826 --> 01:37.265
* And not the sort
Like me you've found *

01:37.298 --> 01:44.104
* We're mean and hard
And we push around *

01:55.649 --> 01:59.953
* I've got a soul
And you broke my heart *

01:59.987 --> 02:04.392
* Find a new scene
And let us depart *

02:04.425 --> 02:09.263
* Don't hang around
And let yourself be caught *

02:13.334 --> 02:17.871
* I've got a soul
And you broke my heart *

02:17.905 --> 02:22.643
* Find a new scene
And let us depart *

02:23.911 --> 02:26.980
* Follow

02:28.616 --> 02:34.922
* Follow, follow

03:11.925 --> 03:14.995
You scratch all day, Charlie.
Still a loser.

03:19.467 --> 03:22.570
Somebody busted the lock.

03:22.603 --> 03:24.472
I had to hold my foot
against the door.

03:24.505 --> 03:27.007
- Good thing, you're flexible.
- Shut up.

03:28.008 --> 03:31.412
- Cutting it pretty close.
- Just fixing my face.

03:31.445 --> 03:32.946
That's my last one.

03:43.156 --> 03:44.258
I'll trade you for it.

03:46.294 --> 03:47.795
Suits you better anyway.

03:50.564 --> 03:52.032
Better go out through the back.

03:52.533 --> 03:53.901
Story of my life.

03:58.038 --> 04:01.309
Parking lot D.
Don't be late.

04:13.754 --> 04:16.324
Well, well, well, boys.
What do you know?

04:16.357 --> 04:17.358
What did you get?

04:20.594 --> 04:22.262
Mickey, tip.

04:38.045 --> 04:42.215
What can I tell you,
Professor? Strippers.

04:42.249 --> 04:45.886
My wife will get everything now.

04:46.620 --> 04:48.356
She'll get my boat.

04:49.590 --> 04:50.858
Maybe not.

04:52.526 --> 04:55.195
-Yet.

05:01.602 --> 05:03.471
I'll give you 500.

05:03.504 --> 05:05.172
She gave me a thousand.

05:17.084 --> 05:18.352
Oh, man.

05:23.256 --> 05:24.825
I love my boat.

05:29.530 --> 05:32.065
-You can get 'em framed.

05:32.099 --> 05:33.100
Okay.

05:34.468 --> 05:36.269
You won't make other copies?

05:37.805 --> 05:39.673
What kind of a guy
do you think I am?

06:05.433 --> 06:08.436
*

06:27.955 --> 06:31.158
*

07:16.436 --> 07:21.041
Our technical director
of the project
of the day was Nicola Tesla...

08:07.054 --> 08:09.089
- Damn it.
Charlie!

08:15.696 --> 08:19.032
*

08:36.817 --> 08:39.352
Hey, it's Kat.
Leave me a message.

08:45.125 --> 08:47.227
Pick up, god damn it!

08:47.260 --> 08:49.863
I don't know where you are
or what the hell just happened.

08:49.897 --> 08:51.398
I'm going to the club, okay?

09:20.761 --> 09:22.663
You know what I mean?

09:24.331 --> 09:27.367
*

09:45.585 --> 09:47.287
Tom Soberin.

09:47.888 --> 09:50.357
- Hey!
- Get out of here!

09:50.390 --> 09:52.525
Seven bucks
for a cranberry juice?

10:02.235 --> 10:05.072
I didn't know
she was working
the Canadian ballet too.

10:05.105 --> 10:07.440
What you don't know
could fill the lake.

10:08.642 --> 10:10.410
She made a date last night.

10:10.443 --> 10:13.246
Jealous?

10:14.948 --> 10:16.616
Never heard of him.

10:16.650 --> 10:19.987
She doesn't try that
bull shit, of course,
on her regulars.

10:20.020 --> 10:21.321
She's in trouble.

10:21.354 --> 10:24.024
Ah, the worst trouble
she's got is you, Charlie.

10:28.328 --> 10:30.864
-Listen if you got her
messed...
-I'll find her.

10:30.898 --> 10:32.265
You're such a bastard.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.435
Mayflower Apartments.

10:36.169 --> 10:38.806
She asked if they were nice.

10:38.839 --> 10:40.507
Maybe she was sizing him up.

10:56.256 --> 11:00.293
Hey, I think you've had
enough of rest. Move it!

11:01.428 --> 11:02.763
Get off the bench!

11:18.779 --> 11:21.749
-Tom Soberin.

11:25.853 --> 11:27.487
"Charlie Paczynski."

11:27.520 --> 11:30.690
Used to bowl for
Charlie Pazinci
Any relation?

11:37.831 --> 11:40.167
I said move it
or I'll call the cops!

11:42.770 --> 11:47.107
*

12:31.384 --> 12:34.788
Come on in, tough guy.
I'm ready.
I already died in '45.

12:34.822 --> 12:36.523
Field surgery during the Bulge.

12:36.556 --> 12:40.493
But, you know, I never did
see that bright light
bull shit either.

12:41.661 --> 12:43.897
6G, you know him?

12:43.931 --> 12:46.299
I know everybody.

12:46.333 --> 12:48.235
You know where he went?

12:48.268 --> 12:51.571
Well, I know,
he left in a hurry.
And he left with nothing.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.073
-Last night.

12:53.106 --> 12:54.441
Oh, damn it.

12:54.474 --> 12:56.509
What are you?
Private investigator?

12:56.944 --> 12:58.311
Yeah.

12:58.345 --> 13:00.881
Oh, I thought
I was making a joke.

13:02.149 --> 13:06.286
You ever investigate
the hazards of man, hmm?

13:09.456 --> 13:11.358
You know anything about him?

13:11.391 --> 13:15.795
I know 6A cooks meatballs
every Friday night,
filled with garlic.

13:15.829 --> 13:19.833
And I know 6B keeps
an illegal pet named Sparky.

13:19.867 --> 13:25.005
And I know that 6D
keeps a key under the mat that
is frequently used by 6H.

13:25.038 --> 13:27.340
But 6G never drew
anyone's attention.

13:27.374 --> 13:29.252
Until you heard him
bolt out of here last night.

13:29.276 --> 13:30.944
And the ado that followed, yes.

13:30.978 --> 13:32.579
What do you mean, ado?

13:32.612 --> 13:35.148
Men in suits.

13:37.117 --> 13:38.818
What do you mean,
"what suits?"

13:38.852 --> 13:41.521
Everyone looks the same
in a suit, like a rat.

13:42.555 --> 13:45.525
Oh. I did hear through
that door over there

13:45.558 --> 13:49.462
they wanted 6G's Tesla file.
"Tesla file," they said.

13:49.496 --> 13:51.999
Tesla file

13:52.032 --> 13:55.502
How should I know?
I don't go nosing around
in other people's business.

13:57.204 --> 13:58.571
Sorry about the lock.

13:59.706 --> 14:02.876
I'm 85 years old,
and I'm not scared.

14:03.576 --> 14:04.577
I'm ready.

14:32.005 --> 14:33.373
Uh-uh, that's mine.

14:33.941 --> 14:35.475
What do you got?

14:35.508 --> 14:36.852
Never mind, Charlie.
What have you got for me?

14:36.876 --> 14:38.587
Well, Your Honor. I've got
a shoe box full of photos

14:38.611 --> 14:40.813
might influence your
constituents in November.

14:40.847 --> 14:41.781
Give me the name.

14:41.814 --> 14:44.284
- Soberin. S-O-B-E-R...
- Can't help you.

14:44.317 --> 14:45.452
Never heard of him.

14:46.119 --> 14:47.320
Hello?

14:48.555 --> 14:49.555
Jerk.

14:53.160 --> 14:56.964
*

14:58.365 --> 15:01.634
Help me, Mr. Paczynski.

15:07.440 --> 15:11.311
-Please, I cannot be seen.

15:12.079 --> 15:15.348
What do you hear?
Take it easy.

15:29.662 --> 15:30.863
Ah, shit.

15:59.993 --> 16:01.461
Your door was open.

16:04.731 --> 16:05.732
Oh.

16:16.309 --> 16:18.011
Been a bad day, miss.

16:18.678 --> 16:19.846
Meeker.

16:21.281 --> 16:22.915
Nicole Meeker.

16:22.949 --> 16:25.052
What brings you to me?

16:25.085 --> 16:28.988
You're the only
private investigator
in the Buffalo phone book.

16:29.022 --> 16:31.358
What, people don't cheat
on their spouses anymore?

16:31.391 --> 16:34.694
Sure they do.
But the spouses don't mind.

16:34.727 --> 16:37.697
The man I was involved with,
he disappeared.

16:37.730 --> 16:39.432
Maybe he ran off with his wife.

16:39.466 --> 16:43.670
I finally found the address
and drove up from Pittsburgh
last night.

16:43.703 --> 16:45.638
I went by this morning,
couldn't get in,

16:45.672 --> 16:48.575
but I did see something
that interested me.

16:48.608 --> 16:50.377
Yeah

16:50.410 --> 16:51.678
I saw you.

16:54.114 --> 16:55.482
What do you mean, me?

16:55.515 --> 16:58.785
The man I'm looking for
is Tom Soberin.

16:58.818 --> 17:02.889
The doorman said that
you were also asking for him.

17:02.922 --> 17:06.659
Tom hasn't been well.
He's been taking medication
for depression.

17:06.693 --> 17:10.029
He's been paranoid, delusional.

17:10.063 --> 17:13.366
He says that people
are watching him.
Even trying to kill him.

17:13.400 --> 17:14.634
He may be right.

17:18.003 --> 17:19.606
Please tell me where he is.

17:21.840 --> 17:25.512
Might not make any sense
to you, but if I speak
to him personally...

17:28.047 --> 17:31.318
I don't mind getting paid
to look for somebody
I'm already looking for.

17:31.351 --> 17:33.253
I'm not paying you
to look for him.

17:33.286 --> 17:34.854
I'm paying you to find him.

17:38.925 --> 17:41.261
You say Soberin's up here
from Pittsburgh?

17:41.294 --> 17:44.997
Distinguished Professor
of Engineering
at Carnegie Mellon University.

17:46.666 --> 17:49.035
He must be distinguished
in all the right places.

17:51.104 --> 17:52.705
My number's on the back.

17:54.073 --> 17:58.945
And yes, I do have
very unconventional taste.

18:13.626 --> 18:18.498
*

20:09.309 --> 20:10.943
Who are you?

20:10.977 --> 20:13.813
Don't look at me!
Keep your eyes out.

20:15.882 --> 20:18.150
You made a date
with my friend last night.

20:19.752 --> 20:21.654
Oh.

20:21.688 --> 20:24.056
-Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't know.
-God damn it!

20:24.090 --> 20:26.302
It's supposed to be a hit,
and you stick her
in the middle of it?

20:26.326 --> 20:29.496
No, no. What's happening here
you can't begin to comprehend.

20:29.529 --> 20:33.400
I'm three seconds,
from throwing you
over the rail.

20:33.433 --> 20:35.302
I'm trying to listen too.

20:35.335 --> 20:37.870
Christ!
She said you lost it.

20:38.771 --> 20:42.008
-Nicole Meeker.

20:42.041 --> 20:43.910
-She's looking for you.

20:43.943 --> 20:47.647
Thinks you're worth
the trouble. I didn't mention
the carnival parking lot.

20:47.680 --> 20:51.318
-I have to tell her.
-If you want to confess
your sins, find a priest.

20:51.351 --> 20:52.685
Who fired the gun?

20:52.719 --> 20:55.422
Tell Nikki I found the Tin Man.

20:55.455 --> 20:57.256
What the hell
are you talking about?

20:57.290 --> 21:01.093
You wanna know
who fired the shots?
Have Nikki meet me.

21:01.127 --> 21:02.529
Where and when?

21:02.562 --> 21:05.832
Today, out on Three Sisters.

21:05.865 --> 21:10.002
You see her,
then you see me.
Got it?

21:10.036 --> 21:11.103
I'll be waiting.

21:13.740 --> 21:15.908
Don't let yourself
be followed again.

21:18.311 --> 21:20.847
I'm so sorry about...

21:21.581 --> 21:23.916
About Kat, I...

21:46.473 --> 21:49.275
Yeah. He's waiting there now.

21:55.047 --> 21:56.349
I gotta go.

22:23.175 --> 22:26.379
*

22:34.554 --> 22:35.688
Hey!

23:05.418 --> 23:06.886
Damn it!

23:45.792 --> 23:47.026
Get the hell out of here.

23:47.059 --> 23:48.861
You got the road jammed up.

23:48.895 --> 23:50.797
You're a long way from Polonia.

23:50.830 --> 23:53.065
Working a missing person case.

23:53.099 --> 23:55.001
You couldn't find a hole
in a donut.

23:55.668 --> 23:57.036
Can I get one of those?

23:57.069 --> 23:58.304
No.

23:58.838 --> 24:00.607
Male or female?

24:00.640 --> 24:02.208
The jumper is male.

24:03.510 --> 24:04.911
Got a light?

24:04.944 --> 24:08.447
Fifth of the season.
The place is a magnet.

24:08.481 --> 24:10.449
Honeymoons and suicides.

24:10.483 --> 24:11.350
What's the difference?

24:11.383 --> 24:13.686
Ha, you should take that
routine to Vegas.

24:13.720 --> 24:15.522
I'll escort you to the airport.

24:15.555 --> 24:17.857
I told you, I got a job
and I already
found the guy.

24:17.890 --> 24:20.192
Some nut out of Pittsburgh
name of Soberin.

24:21.794 --> 24:24.831
Which one of these maroons
put you up to it?

24:24.864 --> 24:26.999
-I don't get it.

24:28.467 --> 24:29.869
You can help tuck him in.

24:35.374 --> 24:36.543
*

24:39.979 --> 24:41.347
She's dead, isn't she?

24:42.915 --> 24:44.917
- If you want me...
- Don't you dare.

24:45.818 --> 24:47.687
I'm gonna find the guy.

24:47.720 --> 24:50.957
Well, you won't
have to look far.

25:40.072 --> 25:41.608
When he didn't show up, I knew.

25:44.343 --> 25:47.980
So the police said
that it was a suicide?

25:48.981 --> 25:50.416
That's how they see it.

25:51.651 --> 25:53.252
And how do you see it?

25:53.285 --> 25:56.155
He was a mess, like you said.

25:56.188 --> 25:58.090
I think somebody
made him a mess.

25:59.191 --> 26:01.661
Doesn't really matter anymore,
does it?

26:01.694 --> 26:02.895
Doesn't it?

26:07.667 --> 26:09.201
Why do you care so much?

26:14.473 --> 26:16.075
Ask me something else.

26:20.913 --> 26:22.915
You ever just want to disappear?

26:27.353 --> 26:29.055
I already have.

26:29.689 --> 26:31.157
No, I mean it.

26:31.190 --> 26:33.325
Go some place where
no one can find you.

26:37.429 --> 26:39.231
I've never been to the ocean.

26:40.867 --> 26:42.268
Yes, what?

26:50.576 --> 26:51.576
What?

27:03.422 --> 27:04.556
Any other day.

27:15.201 --> 27:16.568
There's another day.

28:27.039 --> 28:28.040
Yeah.

28:29.809 --> 28:31.610
I don't know what...
Slow down!

28:32.044 --> 28:34.146
What the hell...

28:38.484 --> 28:39.518
Yeah?

28:40.820 --> 28:42.288
Yeah, you stole my lighter.

28:42.321 --> 28:44.156
Have you been to St
Can you meet me there?

28:44.190 --> 28:47.193
Jesus, not since
I was baptized.
And not today, kid.

29:42.414 --> 29:45.284
*

29:49.188 --> 29:50.556
Son of a bitch.

29:58.664 --> 30:01.267
You ever hear the one
about the tallest detective?

30:01.868 --> 30:03.202
You saved me a trip.

30:08.240 --> 30:10.977
What would you do if you
were in my shoes, Charlie?

30:11.010 --> 30:13.312
- I'd burn my socks.
- Funny.

30:13.846 --> 30:15.081
Ticket at the airport,

30:15.114 --> 30:16.949
carrying more bread
than Hansel and Gretel

30:16.983 --> 30:19.218
and your partner in crime
laying dead in the morgue.

30:19.251 --> 30:20.252
That funny too?

30:20.286 --> 30:22.254
Her name is Kat.
I wanna see her.

30:22.288 --> 30:23.966
Her family is here
and they've never
heard of you.

30:23.990 --> 30:26.893
Weren't you due
a promotion like
three years ago, Escobar?

30:26.926 --> 30:30.229
Meanwhile the guy you set up
takes a nose dive
into the whirlpool.

30:30.262 --> 30:32.098
- They're connected.
- By you.

30:32.131 --> 30:33.232
They're connected by you!

30:33.265 --> 30:34.633
I didn't buy that plane ticket.

30:34.666 --> 30:38.104
Right, it was the knockout
with the wad of cash.

30:38.137 --> 30:39.438
I've had that same dream.

30:39.471 --> 30:41.407
Only my wife's the knockout

30:41.440 --> 30:43.751
and she's carrying
a six pack of beer
and a bucket of wings.

30:43.775 --> 30:46.345
Your wife likes
Polish sausage,
mac, trust me.

30:46.378 --> 30:49.281
Whoa! I'm still
in the room.

30:52.985 --> 30:54.887
We'll need your passport.

30:55.354 --> 30:56.688
You can eat it.

31:01.660 --> 31:03.329
Come on, where's the rest of it?

31:41.600 --> 31:45.504
No, no, no, no, no.
We don't just walk up here.

31:46.005 --> 31:47.306
What do we do?

31:47.339 --> 31:50.476
Well, if we're lucky,
we schedule an appointment.

31:51.210 --> 31:53.712
Appointments are for assholes.

31:53.745 --> 31:55.447
You probably
make 'em all the time.

32:25.011 --> 32:28.914
His mother told him to stop
'cause he ran out of fuel...

32:28.947 --> 32:32.318
But Tesla's mind was already
busy concentrating that...

32:33.819 --> 32:35.354
Did I miss anything good?

32:37.689 --> 32:40.692
Secrets of
the universe revealed.

32:40.726 --> 32:42.861
Like the charge
on the cat's back,

32:42.894 --> 32:45.831
these are examples
of the primitive effect

32:45.864 --> 32:49.735
depicting the energy fields
that surround
every living thing.

32:49.768 --> 32:53.105
Tesla was one of the first
to experiment
with these energies

32:53.139 --> 32:57.743
in a field so often
dismissed as more spiritual
than scientific.

32:57.776 --> 33:01.647
Yet so many of his imaginings
have become our realities,

33:01.680 --> 33:03.549
do we dare doubt the others?

33:04.750 --> 33:07.453
There's a no greater potential
in the world

33:07.486 --> 33:11.523
than those undeciphered
imaginings in our
government's Tesla file.

33:20.699 --> 33:22.934
Hey, you know which one
of these guys is Whitmore?

33:22.968 --> 33:24.670
Yeah. This one.

33:32.778 --> 33:34.012
Tom Soberin.

33:35.414 --> 33:37.416
An expert technician.

33:37.449 --> 33:38.750
And now he's a dead one.

33:38.784 --> 33:41.053
I read that.
Threw himself in the drink.

33:41.687 --> 33:42.688
Maybe.

33:45.357 --> 33:47.059
What is he to you?

33:47.093 --> 33:48.760
I'm a private investigator.

33:49.728 --> 33:52.564
Glad to know
they still make those.

33:52.598 --> 33:56.268
Tom Soberin was using
the Chase-Whitmore
company card.

33:56.302 --> 33:58.737
You'd have to ask
Borden about that.

33:58.770 --> 34:01.340
It's Chase-Whitmore
in name only these days.

34:01.373 --> 34:03.542
My partner was Borden's old man.

34:06.612 --> 34:09.148
So Soberin wasn't
working for you?

34:09.181 --> 34:10.815
If he was working for Borden,

34:10.849 --> 34:13.952
he'd have been lucky to see
daylight, never mind
moonlight for me.

34:13.985 --> 34:15.887
Borden doesn't share.

34:17.456 --> 34:20.792
But you can ask him yourself.

34:20.826 --> 34:25.097
He keeps inviting me
to his shindigs and I keep
not showing up.

34:26.165 --> 34:28.800
Have fun.
Don't talk business.

34:28.833 --> 34:31.570
Weaving spiders come not here.

35:53.752 --> 35:56.154
Giovanni Aldini.

35:57.689 --> 35:59.057
Charlie Paczynski.

35:59.090 --> 36:02.093
Those drawings are from a book
by the Italian physician.

36:02.127 --> 36:04.196
Examples of galvanism.

36:04.230 --> 36:07.333
He ran electric current
through the bodies
of dead animals.

36:07.366 --> 36:09.235
-Theatrics.

36:09.268 --> 36:13.639
But he was also among the first
to treat the mentally ill
by shocking the brain.

36:14.540 --> 36:16.174
Shock treatment?

36:16.208 --> 36:18.009
Thought that was lot of hooey.

36:18.043 --> 36:21.413
History's great discoveries
were all at one time
thought to be,

36:21.447 --> 36:23.915
as you so provincially put it,

36:23.949 --> 36:25.617
"a lot of hooey."

36:31.089 --> 36:34.626
Top shelf.
Where mama hides the cookies.

36:36.562 --> 36:38.897
What's this character up to?

36:38.930 --> 36:42.568
That's a publicity photo
of Nikola Tesla
in his laboratory.

36:42.601 --> 36:46.572
What's he trying to publicize,
that the cheese
slipped off his cracker?

36:46.605 --> 36:48.974
When Tesla needed money
for a project,

36:49.007 --> 36:51.277
he would send
Westinghouser J.P. Morgan

36:51.310 --> 36:53.178
one of those fantastic pictures,

36:53.211 --> 36:54.846
whether it related or not.

36:55.614 --> 36:58.584
It's a fake.
Double exposure.

36:58.617 --> 37:00.286
I'm told a touched up
photo or two

37:00.319 --> 37:02.921
has helped you pay
your bills from time to time.

37:05.924 --> 37:08.727
This isn't an open house,
Mr. Paczynski.

37:10.696 --> 37:13.532
Any idea what sort of trouble
Tom Soberin was in?

37:13.565 --> 37:17.669
Ah, Tom has never said no
to a whiskey or a woman.

37:17.703 --> 37:20.205
-Please.

37:20.238 --> 37:24.175
Legal trouble?
Money trouble?
Did he gamble?

37:24.209 --> 37:28.647
He used his standing
at the university to woo
a co-ed or two.

37:28.680 --> 37:30.916
Pretty risky business,
don't you think?

37:32.518 --> 37:34.085
You gamble,
Mr. Paczynski?

37:34.786 --> 37:36.355
Football
and horses. You?

37:36.955 --> 37:38.290
I make bets.

37:38.324 --> 37:41.493
But it isn't really gambling
if you know who's going to win.

37:41.527 --> 37:42.761
I'll see you out.

37:48.467 --> 37:50.001
Your old partner tells me

37:50.035 --> 37:52.246
he didn't much care
for Soberin working
both sides of the street.

37:52.270 --> 37:54.072
Even you appreciate loyalty.

37:54.105 --> 37:56.207
- So you made him choose.
- Of course.

37:56.241 --> 37:58.109
And Whitmore lost his man.

37:58.143 --> 38:00.579
No. No, I did.

38:00.612 --> 38:02.681
Then why was Soberin
carrying the company...

38:08.620 --> 38:10.722
Ah, my sister
makes an appearance.

38:10.756 --> 38:14.092
Emily, meet
Mr. Paczynski.

38:14.125 --> 38:16.462
Sterling's stand-in
for the evening.

38:16.495 --> 38:17.729
How do you do?

38:17.763 --> 38:18.997
Emily, is it?

38:19.030 --> 38:21.667
Mr. Paczynski
is a genuine gumshoe,

38:21.700 --> 38:24.002
in the great grand tradition
of Philip Marlowe.

38:24.035 --> 38:25.871
I always preferred Mike Hammer.

38:25.904 --> 38:28.006
Even your idols are second rate.

38:28.039 --> 38:31.343
Must be interesting work.
What brings you here?

38:31.377 --> 38:32.678
Bad habit.

38:32.711 --> 38:35.280
When someone lies,
I take it personally.

38:35.313 --> 38:38.116
You shouldn't.
Who lied?

38:38.149 --> 38:40.986
Sterling's been rounding off
the corners of the truth again.

38:41.019 --> 38:46.324
It seems Mr. Paczynski, isn't
buying the official version
of Tom Soberin's demise.

38:46.858 --> 38:48.527
I don't blame him.

38:48.560 --> 38:50.161
You don't know the half of it.

38:51.196 --> 38:52.263
Thanks for the drink.

40:04.470 --> 40:07.939
You came to me looking
for Tom Soberin, didn't you?

40:09.908 --> 40:11.877
The newspaper said suicide.

40:14.179 --> 40:15.380
Who was he to you?

40:16.181 --> 40:18.917
My mentor, at the university.

40:18.950 --> 40:20.318
You were working with him?

40:20.819 --> 40:22.020
I work alone.

40:28.193 --> 40:31.930
Look, I didn't even know
Tom Soberin was here.

40:31.963 --> 40:34.866
I was hired by a man
named Sterling Whitmore.

40:36.535 --> 40:37.669
To do what?

40:37.703 --> 40:40.438
Study a design, an invention.
Anyway,

40:40.472 --> 40:45.443
every night I had to turn in
my notes, and every morning
I would get them back.

40:45.477 --> 40:48.547
People take all kinds
of precautions
in my line of work.

40:49.280 --> 40:50.415
Okay.

40:50.448 --> 40:54.185
But two days ago,
something odd happened.

40:54.219 --> 40:57.556
When I got my notes back,
there was a mark on them.

40:57.589 --> 41:02.093
A symbol Tom Soberin
would make when he thought
I miscalculated.

41:02.127 --> 41:04.462
So Whitmore hired Soberin
to double check your homework?

41:05.497 --> 41:07.533
-But there was no mistake.

41:08.567 --> 41:09.635
I know.

41:09.668 --> 41:11.169
Why did he make the note?

41:12.370 --> 41:13.572
To send a message.

41:13.605 --> 41:15.707
-To stop.

41:15.741 --> 41:17.676
To stop working
on the design and see him.

41:17.709 --> 41:19.177
Just like at school.

41:19.210 --> 41:22.614
So I called the university
and they told me he was here,

41:22.648 --> 41:24.149
at the Mayflower.

41:24.182 --> 41:27.686
When I went to my apartment
there were men
coming out of it.

41:27.719 --> 41:29.254
I've been dodging them
ever since.

41:30.055 --> 41:31.790
What do you expect me to do?

41:31.823 --> 41:33.892
If Tom wanted me to stop,

41:34.693 --> 41:36.494
whoever killed him knows why.

41:38.930 --> 41:40.498
What makes you think I care?

41:42.333 --> 41:43.535
Well, you're here.

41:51.877 --> 41:53.211
You got a name?

41:54.512 --> 41:55.981
I'm Nikki Meeker.

41:57.448 --> 41:59.517
Here, your lighter.

42:04.723 --> 42:06.625
Tom was a master technician.

42:07.425 --> 42:08.425
Great.

42:09.561 --> 42:11.396
You don't hire him to design.

42:12.664 --> 42:15.033
You hire him to build.

43:06.718 --> 43:08.286
Damn it.

43:17.128 --> 43:20.932
*

43:45.657 --> 43:47.025
Let's go, man.

43:58.536 --> 44:01.907
I've been run out of a few
of Borden's parties myself.

44:01.940 --> 44:06.845
I can only take those assholes
for so long before I say
something that pisses 'em off.

44:06.878 --> 44:08.513
You saying Chase
tried to run me down?

44:10.315 --> 44:14.986
Wake up, Paczynski.
That's Bohemian Grove
Buffalo style.

44:15.020 --> 44:17.122
Bohemian Grove?

44:17.155 --> 44:19.057
That camp near San Fran

44:19.090 --> 44:21.492
where all the big wigs
dance around the bonfire

44:21.526 --> 44:24.763
thinking up ways
to manipulate
the world economy?

44:24.796 --> 44:27.632
Nixon said it was
the faggiest thing
he ever saw.

44:27.665 --> 44:28.867
Look what happened to him.

44:30.702 --> 44:35.173
That's a string pulling crowd
pulling your string.

44:35.206 --> 44:37.175
Chase got something to hide?

44:39.110 --> 44:40.779
We all got something.

44:43.381 --> 44:48.787
You, uh... You've done some
strange pulling yourself.

44:48.820 --> 44:52.557
I'm one generation removed
from a carnival barker.

44:52.590 --> 44:54.492
What lie did I tell you?

44:54.525 --> 44:57.562
You said Tom Soberin
wasn't on your payroll.

44:57.595 --> 45:02.500
I said he didn't get
the Chase-Whitmore
company card from me.

45:02.533 --> 45:04.002
Check your notes.

45:04.035 --> 45:07.138
-Great story.

45:08.506 --> 45:10.508
Little Roger Wood,

45:10.541 --> 45:14.312
a propeller pin sheared off
their boat motor.

45:14.345 --> 45:17.182
Boy went over the edge
of Niagara Falls

45:17.215 --> 45:20.986
with nothing more than
a life vest
and his swim trunks.

45:21.019 --> 45:22.988
Nary a scratch.

45:23.021 --> 45:26.224
The boat driver was
battered and drowned.

45:26.591 --> 45:27.592
Great story.

45:28.359 --> 45:31.362
Same journey, different results.

45:31.396 --> 45:34.766
Of course, that was
the Canadian Horseshoe.

45:36.334 --> 45:40.071
What no one has ever done
is survive the American side.

45:40.105 --> 45:45.276
Great for suicides,
not so good for pickle barrels
and diving bells.

45:45.310 --> 45:47.245
But there is a way.

45:48.379 --> 45:52.017
With precise trajectory
and an ideal rate of flow,

45:52.050 --> 45:54.352
a properly built device
could manage it.

45:54.920 --> 45:56.454
Good luck.

45:56.487 --> 45:57.823
Come on in, Stick.

45:59.324 --> 46:03.061
Stick, this is
Mr. Paczynski.

46:03.094 --> 46:05.730
Ah, we picked up your car.

46:05.763 --> 46:07.365
Have it humming by morning.

46:07.398 --> 46:09.500
Mr. Stickney, here,
is a riverman.

46:09.534 --> 46:13.671
Knows Niagara better than
the average man knows
his own shoes.

46:13.704 --> 46:17.075
When you first heard the falls,
how close were you?

46:17.108 --> 46:20.378
Uh, I don't know a mile or two.

46:20.411 --> 46:22.580
I can hear 'em right now.

46:28.119 --> 46:33.291
If you think I'm buying that
Tom Soberin was building
you a barrel, you're nuts.

46:33.324 --> 46:37.062
One man's nuts
is another man's balls.

46:38.496 --> 46:42.200
Nikki Meeker wasn't making
notes for a sideshow stunt.

46:43.168 --> 46:45.203
You talked with her?

46:46.071 --> 46:48.339
-She's fine.

46:49.174 --> 46:50.475
Where is she?

46:52.043 --> 46:54.145
Tell me about Chase's sister.

46:55.313 --> 46:57.515
Mighty sexy, if you ask me.

46:58.549 --> 47:00.118
What does she do?

47:00.151 --> 47:02.320
Looks good
in the company newsletter.

47:05.957 --> 47:09.827
You look like you could use
some shut-eye, Mr. Paczynski.

47:09.861 --> 47:12.263
You're welcome to one
of our guest rooms.

47:14.532 --> 47:18.403
There are planners
and there are doers.

47:18.436 --> 47:21.372
You strike me as a doer.
Am I right?

47:22.340 --> 47:23.808
I'm just a guy.

47:28.947 --> 47:30.215
Yeah.

48:07.085 --> 48:08.686
Quite a feat, isn't it?

48:09.720 --> 48:12.257
I was with
the Corps of Engineers
on that one.

48:13.391 --> 48:15.326
Wish we could do it again.

48:16.461 --> 48:19.364
Give us a leg up
on our travel plans.

48:22.600 --> 48:23.601
You ready?

49:18.223 --> 49:23.361
*

50:19.050 --> 50:23.788
*

51:05.196 --> 51:09.867
*

51:37.895 --> 51:42.066
*

51:52.643 --> 51:55.313
Charlie, you been following me?

51:55.346 --> 51:56.614
Don't think I won't crack you.

51:56.647 --> 51:57.982
I think you'd love to.

51:58.015 --> 51:59.517
You set up Tom Soberin.

51:59.550 --> 52:02.587
- You paid Kat to get him
in that parking lot.

52:02.620 --> 52:04.822
I paid her to make sure
Tom had a good time.

52:04.855 --> 52:05.723
He didn't.

52:05.756 --> 52:07.492
-She's fine.

52:07.525 --> 52:08.859
It's fine.

52:08.893 --> 52:10.595
-Yeah, ask for Maguire.

52:10.628 --> 52:12.330
And you used me
to finish the job.

52:12.363 --> 52:13.831
Please, can't we talk
about this...

52:13.864 --> 52:15.642
Phone book's full of names,
why call yourself Nikki Meeker?

52:15.666 --> 52:17.668
If my brother
found out what I did...

52:17.702 --> 52:19.337
Please it's not safe.

52:19.370 --> 52:22.873
You can tell me or the police,
maybe squirt out
a few tears this time.

52:24.709 --> 52:27.011
My brother kept
a design in his safe.

52:27.044 --> 52:29.680
A very valuable
but incomplete design.

52:29.714 --> 52:31.449
Whitmore knew
it would rot in there, so

52:31.482 --> 52:34.552
we made a deal.
I'd get it, and he'd find
someone to make sense of it.

52:34.585 --> 52:35.853
Now, we're getting somewhere.

52:35.886 --> 52:38.088
Whitmore gave
Nicole's notes to Soberin.

52:38.122 --> 52:41.158
And whatever was
in those notes made
Soberin come running to me.

52:41.192 --> 52:42.393
Why?

52:42.427 --> 52:44.262
He said the design
shouldn't be developed.

52:44.295 --> 52:45.463
What do you mean?
What is it?

52:45.496 --> 52:47.097
- I don't know. He didn't say.
- Come on!

52:47.131 --> 52:49.934
It was never finished,
that's why we hired Nicole.

52:51.202 --> 52:52.603
You have to believe me.

52:52.637 --> 52:55.072
I did a stupid thing,
not a terrible thing.

52:55.105 --> 52:56.807
You've done both
and your brother knows it.

52:56.841 --> 52:58.652
My brother doesn't even know
the design went missing.

52:58.676 --> 53:00.487
Well, someone tried to make
a speed bump out of me.

53:00.511 --> 53:02.647
Whoever they were,
they killed Soberin and Kat.

53:02.680 --> 53:05.250
And they'll come after you.
Just leave.

53:05.283 --> 53:07.017
Uh-uh.

53:07.051 --> 53:09.787
Well, I hope you can protect
Nicole better than I did.

53:11.422 --> 53:12.857
You called her Nikki.

53:14.325 --> 53:15.760
Please, let me make this right.

53:15.793 --> 53:17.428
We're way past making it right.

53:17.462 --> 53:18.829
I'm sorry, I...

53:21.599 --> 53:23.634
I would've met you
on that beach.

53:23.668 --> 53:26.036
You're a beautiful
piece of work, kid.

53:26.070 --> 53:29.139
But if you killed Kat,
I'm gonna nail you to the wall.

53:50.861 --> 53:52.930
Slavko fixed your faucet.

53:53.964 --> 53:57.302
Extraordinary what some people
learn to tolerate.

54:07.612 --> 54:09.814
You may have something
we're looking for.

54:10.581 --> 54:12.283
Sense of humor?

54:28.366 --> 54:31.201
Maybe I can save you some time.

54:31.235 --> 54:34.171
I'm quite certain
you do not know
what we're looking for

54:34.204 --> 54:36.006
or where it is.

54:36.040 --> 54:37.174
But I've got it.

54:38.509 --> 54:40.345
Don't feel bad.

54:40.378 --> 54:43.648
Most of the world
does not know
what is under its nose.

54:44.949 --> 54:46.016
Mustache.

54:48.453 --> 54:53.057
Here you are, banging
your head against the dark,
as they say,

54:53.090 --> 54:54.692
and you keep at it.

54:54.725 --> 54:56.894
You keep at it.
Very good.

54:59.397 --> 55:01.131
Excuse me.

55:06.871 --> 55:08.873
Well, you've heard of the FBI.

55:09.640 --> 55:11.342
Think of us as their brothers.

55:18.516 --> 55:23.020
Whoa! Final notice.
From last week.

56:17.842 --> 56:19.009
- You.
- You.

56:19.043 --> 56:21.278
Special Agent Barry,
I work with DARPA.

56:21.311 --> 56:22.547
Who's she?

56:22.580 --> 56:25.115
They track the best ideas
and the brightest minds
behind them.

56:25.149 --> 56:27.618
I can see why you came to me.

56:33.824 --> 56:36.794
My goodness, somebody
turned this place upside down.

56:39.930 --> 56:41.532
The Serbs were here.

56:41.566 --> 56:43.167
Sounded Russian.

56:43.200 --> 56:45.903
Tesla was a Serb.
Did they take anything?

56:45.936 --> 56:48.506
Yeah. I had a Picasso
hanging right there.

56:48.539 --> 56:50.741
-Come here.

56:54.078 --> 56:55.880
I don't need you to explain it.

56:55.913 --> 56:59.083
I want to know if you've
ever seen anything like it.

56:59.116 --> 57:00.718
Why would I?

57:00.751 --> 57:03.630
Because Tom Soberin's lungs
were full of Niagara
90 minutes after he met you.

57:03.654 --> 57:04.822
What the hell is going on?

57:04.855 --> 57:06.323
Have you ever heard
of Nicola Tesla?

57:06.356 --> 57:09.093
Yeah, about 48 hours ago.
He invented something right?

57:09.126 --> 57:11.929
-Yeah, the 20th century.

57:12.797 --> 57:13.931
Your car.

57:21.005 --> 57:23.674
I will tell as much as I can,
as fast as I can.

57:23.708 --> 57:26.110
Tesla kept an notebook
of theoretical inventions

57:26.143 --> 57:28.045
locked in his safe
at New Yorker Hotel.

57:28.078 --> 57:32.883
That notebook contained
everything from a free energy
system to so called death ray.

57:32.917 --> 57:35.653
Within an hour of his death,
the United States government

57:35.686 --> 57:37.187
seized everything in that room.

57:37.221 --> 57:40.457
But somebody else
got there first
and the notebook was gone.

57:40.491 --> 57:43.561
Six months ago there was
a black market auction
in Stockholm

57:43.594 --> 57:47.097
for a disintegrating page torn
from a decades-old notebook.

57:47.131 --> 57:48.966
Half a design
for an unknown invention.

57:48.999 --> 57:51.268
Nicole Meeker
was the last person
to have it.

57:51.301 --> 57:54.171
We think she smuggled it out
and we know she came to you.

57:54.204 --> 57:55.649
I don't have it.
She never gave me anything.

57:55.673 --> 57:57.884
She could've planted it
in your office, your car,
anything.

57:57.908 --> 57:59.544
She's never set foot in either.

57:59.577 --> 58:01.078
There are less than
a dozen minds

58:01.111 --> 58:03.447
that our government sees fit
to keep tabs on,

58:03.480 --> 58:04.782
for their safety and ours.

58:04.815 --> 58:07.752
Nicole Meeker is one of them
and it is my job
to bring her in.

58:07.785 --> 58:08.919
Hey, I won't stop you.

58:08.953 --> 58:09.954
Take a right up here.

58:09.987 --> 58:11.455
Where do the Serbs fit in?

58:11.488 --> 58:15.159
That notebook
is like the holy grail
for Serbian nationals.

58:15.192 --> 58:17.427
They will track the globe
for any sign of it.

58:17.461 --> 58:19.897
Half a design
and nobody even knows
what the hell it's for?

58:19.930 --> 58:21.899
Imagine introducing
an automobile

58:21.932 --> 58:23.968
with an unlimited energy supply.

58:24.001 --> 58:27.605
Or a system to irrigate
the deserts of Africa.

58:27.638 --> 58:29.206
Tesla thought it possible

58:29.239 --> 58:32.142
for people
to transmit themselves.

58:32.176 --> 58:34.845
Do you hear what I'm saying?
Transmit themselves.

58:34.879 --> 58:36.747
Just because he thought it,
doesn't make it so.

58:36.781 --> 58:39.016
When people were getting
around on horseback,

58:39.049 --> 58:40.918
he envisioned a wireless device

58:40.951 --> 58:42.591
so small you could
keep it in your pocket.

58:42.620 --> 58:45.455
It would let you check
the news or the stock market

58:45.489 --> 58:48.092
or talk to anyone
anywhere in the world.

58:48.125 --> 58:49.560
Here, all the way to the top.

58:50.861 --> 58:53.764
Television,
satellite technology,
computers,

58:53.798 --> 58:55.332
everything we take
for granted...

58:55.365 --> 58:57.267
-Yes, yes, Tesla. All of it.

58:57.301 --> 58:59.336
How come I never heard
of him before Tuesday?

58:59.369 --> 59:01.205
The politics of science.

59:03.540 --> 59:06.711
Whatever it is, I'd rather
we have it than anybody else.

59:06.744 --> 59:08.212
Chase killed Soberin over this?

59:08.245 --> 59:10.247
He's got a buyer,
we want them both.

59:10.280 --> 59:12.149
We know when but not where.

59:12.182 --> 59:14.685
He can't sell
what he doesn't have.

59:14.719 --> 59:17.855
But he expects
to get his design back
one way or another.

59:17.888 --> 59:19.990
I'm offering you a way out.

59:20.024 --> 59:22.593
Bring Nicole in
and we can protect you both.

59:27.264 --> 59:29.934
This is where you tell me,
my country needs me, right?

59:29.967 --> 59:34.471
Tomorrow, Silo City,
foot of Ohio Street.
Should we expect you?

59:35.606 --> 59:37.241
You had me at death ray.

01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:24.722
Get your things.

01:00:26.323 --> 01:00:29.259
-I had some visitors.

01:00:31.161 --> 01:00:33.664
Just like me and Soberin?

01:00:33.698 --> 01:00:36.400
I might've had
different guys.
They fixed my sink.

01:00:37.434 --> 01:00:39.336
Visitors were followed
by the FBI.

01:00:39.369 --> 01:00:41.739
And the FBI was followed
by some dark suits.

01:00:43.107 --> 01:00:44.474
So you're handing me over?

01:00:44.508 --> 01:00:45.642
To give them the design.

01:00:45.676 --> 01:00:47.644
And what will they do with it?

01:00:48.979 --> 01:00:51.381
When a scientist
advances a theory,

01:00:51.415 --> 01:00:54.451
they open it up to the world,
people make with it
whatever they want.

01:00:54.484 --> 01:00:56.086
I can't protect you.

01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:58.055
I don't need a protector.

01:00:58.689 --> 01:01:00.190
I need an ally.

01:01:07.397 --> 01:01:08.397
Is this it?

01:01:10.067 --> 01:01:11.769
Half of it.

01:01:11.802 --> 01:01:13.403
You know what it is yet?

01:01:13.437 --> 01:01:15.339
A kind of amplifier for energy.

01:01:17.441 --> 01:01:19.443
I'm not sure how
it's meant to be used.

01:01:20.077 --> 01:01:21.712
You think Soberin knew?

01:01:21.746 --> 01:01:23.313
I don't see how he could.

01:01:24.381 --> 01:01:26.350
I've never seen
anything like it.

01:01:33.623 --> 01:01:35.159
Belonged to a friend.

01:01:37.962 --> 01:01:39.797
Then you better hold on to it.

01:01:40.965 --> 01:01:42.232
Michael.

01:01:43.567 --> 01:01:44.735
You can do this one now.

01:01:47.137 --> 01:01:48.638
And bring the original.

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:51.641
I burned it.

01:02:21.738 --> 01:02:24.674
*

01:03:07.885 --> 01:03:09.253
-Run!

01:03:55.365 --> 01:03:59.269
*

01:04:29.900 --> 01:04:33.570
*

01:04:42.512 --> 01:04:43.847
You son of a bitch!

01:05:25.689 --> 01:05:26.689
Nikki!

01:05:55.919 --> 01:06:01.691
*

01:06:55.612 --> 01:06:58.682
Well, I'd say we're even.

01:06:58.715 --> 01:07:01.285
What have I gotten
myself into here?

01:07:01.318 --> 01:07:03.153
That's a hell of a question
he's asking.

01:07:03.187 --> 01:07:05.365
Those suits back there
didn't mind killing
a federal agent.

01:07:05.389 --> 01:07:08.192
Didn't mind killing me,
but not you. Why not?

01:07:08.225 --> 01:07:09.526
Someone was killed?

01:07:09.559 --> 01:07:11.395
Well, you must
understand by now.

01:07:11.428 --> 01:07:12.829
No, I don't understand.

01:07:12.862 --> 01:07:14.674
I don't understand any of it.
I don't understand you!

01:07:14.698 --> 01:07:16.809
You think they're pissed now.
Wait till they found out
you burned the thing?

01:07:16.833 --> 01:07:19.936
Look, you want my help,
you better start sharing
some goddamn information.

01:07:19.969 --> 01:07:22.672
Any more surprises,
now's the time.

01:07:23.773 --> 01:07:26.843
Your FBI agent
pushed this into my hand.

01:07:31.315 --> 01:07:32.882
What do you know about DARPA?

01:07:32.916 --> 01:07:35.452
Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency.

01:07:35.485 --> 01:07:36.886
I'm a physics professor.

01:07:37.654 --> 01:07:39.523
You a bit of a science buff?

01:07:39.556 --> 01:07:42.058
DARPA tried to recruit me
off the Carnegie Campus.

01:07:42.092 --> 01:07:43.493
Well, la di dah.

01:07:43.527 --> 01:07:46.130
Barry was working for them
or so she claimed.

01:07:46.163 --> 01:07:48.932
If Tesla's involved,
they're never far behind.

01:07:48.965 --> 01:07:50.267
Tesla?

01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:52.569
Oh, come on.
I lecture on Tesla.

01:07:52.602 --> 01:07:54.471
The war of the currents.

01:07:54.971 --> 01:07:56.640
He beat out Edison.

01:07:56.673 --> 01:07:59.976
He built a power station
at Niagara that
electrified Buffalo.

01:08:00.009 --> 01:08:03.847
But most of his ideas
were suppressed.
It's all politics.

01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:05.815
Same reason I didn't get tenure.

01:08:05.849 --> 01:08:09.119
The ideas that got support
were the ones that
could be weaponized.

01:08:09.153 --> 01:08:12.656
That's why he stopped labeling
his diagrams and started
splitting them in half.

01:08:12.689 --> 01:08:14.558
Splitting them in half?

01:08:14.591 --> 01:08:17.127
He knew
someone would exploit them.

01:08:17.161 --> 01:08:19.629
Yeah. They're called
the Department of Defense.

01:08:20.264 --> 01:08:21.831
He even hid parts of design.

01:08:21.865 --> 01:08:24.600
-Hid wherever he worked.

01:08:24.634 --> 01:08:27.069
His lab in Colorado,
the tower he built
on Long Island.

01:08:27.103 --> 01:08:31.408
Both destroyed. Coincidence?
I think not.

01:08:31.441 --> 01:08:32.917
What about the power station
in Niagara?

01:08:32.942 --> 01:08:36.212
Collapsed with
10,000 cubic feet
of rushing water

01:08:36.246 --> 01:08:37.613
blocking the access tunnels.

01:08:37.647 --> 01:08:42.852
Look, Tesla, didn't just
cut designs in half,

01:08:42.886 --> 01:08:45.955
he disguised how
the designs went together.

01:08:45.988 --> 01:08:49.959
Look, just like these
nautical charts.
That looks right, right?

01:08:49.993 --> 01:08:53.630
But this, see, doesn't go
directly next to that.

01:09:03.907 --> 01:09:04.941
She's good.

01:09:07.377 --> 01:09:10.747
Tesla was also one of the first
to warn against
the dangers of smoking.

01:09:14.917 --> 01:09:16.553
What does this look like to you?

01:09:20.224 --> 01:09:22.326
Reminds me of a Tin Man.

01:09:22.359 --> 01:09:23.727
Like from the Wizard of Oz?

01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:25.761
No, Tin Man
from the Sound of Music.

01:09:27.997 --> 01:09:29.233
What does it mean?

01:09:29.265 --> 01:09:31.000
Something Soberin said.

01:09:33.703 --> 01:09:35.572
We've been sitting here
too long.

01:10:58.254 --> 01:10:59.956
Lots of prohibition.

01:10:59.989 --> 01:11:02.992
Polonia got into
witness protection.

01:11:03.026 --> 01:11:06.162
You know where
the devil can't go,
he sends a woman.

01:11:08.765 --> 01:11:10.600
She doesn't trust me either.

01:11:11.468 --> 01:11:13.236
It's just a Polish proverb.

01:11:13.269 --> 01:11:14.771
Well, she said it in English.

01:11:16.005 --> 01:11:17.974
I never said I didn't trust you.

01:11:18.007 --> 01:11:21.645
That's good.
'Cause I don't
have time to earn it.

01:11:23.513 --> 01:11:25.582
Where are you going?

01:11:25.615 --> 01:11:27.851
Those were Borden Chase's
men back there.

01:11:28.251 --> 01:11:29.185
Chase?

01:11:29.218 --> 01:11:31.655
His sister took the designs
from the safe.

01:11:31.688 --> 01:11:33.623
He's been ringing her out
to get 'em back.

01:11:34.591 --> 01:11:35.859
What will you do?

01:11:37.126 --> 01:11:38.862
Convince her
to go to the police.

01:11:39.763 --> 01:11:41.197
Get one good shot at him.

01:11:42.265 --> 01:11:43.265
Really?

01:11:44.334 --> 01:11:45.802
I don't even own a gun.

01:11:48.171 --> 01:11:49.171
Hey.

01:11:51.775 --> 01:11:53.710
He doesn't know I burned it.

01:14:43.112 --> 01:14:45.982
I must've shorted out
the security system again.

01:14:46.015 --> 01:14:48.985
I've done some things,
but you take the prize.

01:14:50.219 --> 01:14:52.188
Pretty wild stuff, isn't it?

01:14:53.156 --> 01:14:55.925
Oh, come on.
Don't be so provincial.

01:14:55.959 --> 01:14:58.227
That's the second time
you called me that.

01:14:58.261 --> 01:15:00.797
All these books
and no thesaurus?

01:15:00.830 --> 01:15:03.432
-In the dungeon.

01:15:03.466 --> 01:15:04.934
I don't like your jokes.

01:15:04.968 --> 01:15:08.738
You seem like the type of guy
who thinks anyone
with money is a crook.

01:15:08.772 --> 01:15:10.874
I think everyone is a crook.

01:15:10.907 --> 01:15:12.208
You're a killer.

01:15:13.309 --> 01:15:15.011
I'm a businessman.

01:15:15.044 --> 01:15:16.780
Now, what will it cost me

01:15:16.813 --> 01:15:20.684
to turn your attention back
to reservation cigarettes
and discount liquor?

01:15:20.717 --> 01:15:23.386
Your sister,
and I'll throw in a bonus.

01:15:23.419 --> 01:15:26.923
What can you possibly offer me
besides admiration.

01:15:26.956 --> 01:15:28.958
The former contents
of your safe.

01:15:28.992 --> 01:15:31.094
I can get it back,
never mind how.

01:15:31.527 --> 01:15:32.862
Mr. Paczynski.

01:15:37.133 --> 01:15:39.969
Apparently he caught a glimpse
of our little therapy session.

01:15:40.003 --> 01:15:41.504
He can't get his
brain around it.

01:15:41.537 --> 01:15:44.007
So now we're going
to spend the evening
staring one another?

01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:46.542
She leaves with me.
That's the deal.

01:15:46.576 --> 01:15:48.645
She's not on
a leash... today.

01:15:49.312 --> 01:15:50.113
Deal for what?

01:15:50.146 --> 01:15:51.948
The design, tell him.

01:15:51.981 --> 01:15:54.517
That design took me
25 years to acquire.

01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:57.153
Do you know
what I would do to someone
who tried to steal it?

01:15:57.186 --> 01:15:59.589
Lighting her up like
a Christmas tree
wasn't enough?

01:15:59.623 --> 01:16:03.292
Over a million people
were treated with
electroconvulsive therapy

01:16:03.326 --> 01:16:04.360
last year alone.

01:16:04.393 --> 01:16:05.428
Treated for what?

01:16:07.296 --> 01:16:08.296
Emily.

01:16:09.098 --> 01:16:11.200
My sister wouldn't
steal from me.

01:16:12.769 --> 01:16:16.305
Because she knows
that if she did,

01:16:16.339 --> 01:16:19.575
the retribution
would be biblical.

01:16:23.613 --> 01:16:26.282
What kind of a man would
betray his sister's trust

01:16:26.315 --> 01:16:29.352
because of the accusations
of a night crawler like you.

01:16:30.353 --> 01:16:31.688
Open the safe.

01:16:31.721 --> 01:16:33.256
We're family, Mr. Paczynski.

01:16:33.289 --> 01:16:35.491
That's a gene pool
screaming for chlorine.

01:16:37.761 --> 01:16:39.195
The feds will be coming.

01:17:22.205 --> 01:17:23.840
He'd have taken the money.

01:17:23.873 --> 01:17:25.742
This broad offers you
the golden goose

01:17:25.775 --> 01:17:27.052
and you wanna
cook it for dinner.

01:17:27.076 --> 01:17:29.412
He's got a goddamn
electric chair in his house.

01:17:29.445 --> 01:17:31.256
Don't you think that's
a little out of the ordinary?

01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:34.150
You're ordinary.
These people are not.

01:17:34.183 --> 01:17:35.318
And the grain elevator?

01:17:35.351 --> 01:17:37.153
Not only was there no dead body,

01:17:37.186 --> 01:17:39.956
but the FBI never heard
of your Agent Barry.

01:17:39.989 --> 01:17:41.991
-And,

01:17:42.025 --> 01:17:43.827
as you can see,

01:17:43.860 --> 01:17:46.662
no sordid Chase
family history either.

01:17:46.696 --> 01:17:47.864
He's got something on her.

01:17:47.897 --> 01:17:51.434
Except maybe the old man
contemplating the long goodbye.

01:17:51.467 --> 01:17:53.436
-Read.

01:17:53.469 --> 01:17:56.906
William C. Chase,
three arrests, three months,
summer of '69.

01:17:56.940 --> 01:17:59.175
All up to the state park
at the Falls.

01:17:59.642 --> 01:18:00.609
Trespassing?

01:18:00.643 --> 01:18:03.747
Either he was suicidal
or smoking wacky tabacky.

01:18:04.613 --> 01:18:06.049
Pretty thin, you'd agree?

01:18:06.082 --> 01:18:08.017
Unless he was wearing
a scuba suit.

01:18:08.051 --> 01:18:10.754
Just what the hell goes on
inside your head?

01:18:10.787 --> 01:18:12.856
Personal items returned.

01:18:12.889 --> 01:18:15.358
A flash light and an ax,
no snorkel.

01:18:19.328 --> 01:18:21.497
Leave that
to the professionals, Charlie.

01:18:29.438 --> 01:18:31.474
What was Soberin
building for you?

01:18:32.809 --> 01:18:34.277
I was there.

01:18:34.310 --> 01:18:35.711
I was seven years old.

01:18:36.846 --> 01:18:39.348
You didn't hire Nikki Meeker
for a barrel ride.

01:18:39.382 --> 01:18:42.051
What do you think he could
build with half a design?

01:18:42.085 --> 01:18:45.254
I didn't want him to build it.
I wanted to know what it was.

01:18:45.288 --> 01:18:47.590
How would Soberin know
what it was any more
than Nikki?

01:18:47.623 --> 01:18:50.726
He worked for the same outfit
as your FBI gal.

01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:52.695
-Sure.

01:18:52.728 --> 01:18:56.032
Enlisted to inform them
any time he got wind of

01:18:56.065 --> 01:18:59.402
extraordinary discoveries,
inventions or people.

01:18:59.435 --> 01:19:02.038
DARPA has no
operational mission.

01:19:02.071 --> 01:19:04.573
They want a radical innovation
of any kind.

01:19:04.607 --> 01:19:09.012
You don't think that something
like guided missiles
came along because

01:19:09.045 --> 01:19:11.881
some general filled out
an R and D request.

01:19:11.915 --> 01:19:14.217
They don't mind
a thousand failures

01:19:14.250 --> 01:19:18.754
because one success changes
the whole goddamn game.

01:19:18.788 --> 01:19:22.491
And a guy like Tesla would
be a goldmine for an outfit
like that.

01:19:22.525 --> 01:19:25.628
Don't kid yourself.
Tesla is the outfit.

01:19:25.661 --> 01:19:28.664
*

01:19:30.299 --> 01:19:34.770
Reagan's Star Wars,
the HAARP complex
in Alaska,

01:19:34.804 --> 01:19:39.876
the Manhattan Project...
Bohemian Grove's greatest hits.

01:19:39.909 --> 01:19:44.080
Soberin was briefed
on Tesla's
unpublished theories.

01:19:44.113 --> 01:19:45.548
If a design surfaced...

01:19:45.581 --> 01:19:47.984
He was trained to recognize
what it was for.

01:19:48.017 --> 01:19:50.419
- But he didn't.
- He did.

01:19:50.453 --> 01:19:52.121
He just didn't tell you.

01:19:54.257 --> 01:19:56.459
If someone had both halves...

01:19:56.492 --> 01:19:58.594
And knew how
to put them together,

01:19:58.627 --> 01:20:01.297
that someone could
change the world.

01:20:14.978 --> 01:20:18.581
*

01:20:53.782 --> 01:20:57.353
*

01:21:22.678 --> 01:21:23.812
Charlie.

01:21:25.181 --> 01:21:26.215
What happened?

01:21:26.249 --> 01:21:27.984
I can't go back there.

01:21:28.017 --> 01:21:29.052
Then go to the police.

01:21:29.085 --> 01:21:30.219
They won't believe me.

01:21:30.253 --> 01:21:32.255
-I'll make 'em.

01:21:36.492 --> 01:21:38.627
Why'd you stand by him
back there?

01:21:40.163 --> 01:21:42.298
He never believed
I broke into the safe,

01:21:42.331 --> 01:21:44.767
but he put on a show
about trusting me.

01:21:46.169 --> 01:21:49.172
And when you left, he opened it.

01:21:49.205 --> 01:21:50.706
Oh, Jesus.

01:21:53.442 --> 01:21:54.710
Take your hand out.

01:21:58.914 --> 01:21:59.949
Take it out.

01:22:04.220 --> 01:22:05.854
Goddamn it.

01:22:05.888 --> 01:22:07.190
It's not your fault.

01:22:07.223 --> 01:22:09.358
I should have
never taken the design.

01:22:09.392 --> 01:22:10.994
We gotta get you out of here.

01:22:11.027 --> 01:22:13.362
- I've made plans.
- Then go.

01:22:13.963 --> 01:22:15.598
For all of us.

01:22:15.631 --> 01:22:17.233
I'm not going anywhere yet.

01:22:17.266 --> 01:22:18.801
He'll kill you.

01:22:18.834 --> 01:22:20.403
He'll kill Nicole.

01:22:21.504 --> 01:22:24.507
Please. Let me do this.

01:22:27.243 --> 01:22:29.712
Then let's get you
and Nikki out.

01:22:38.554 --> 01:22:39.888
You all right?

01:22:41.424 --> 01:22:43.759
I'm just, um,
figuring something out.

01:22:44.827 --> 01:22:47.896
This is Emily Chase.
She can get you out.

01:22:47.930 --> 01:22:50.266
The Professor will take you
both to the pump station.

01:22:50.299 --> 01:22:51.700
She'll have a boat
there tonight.

01:22:51.734 --> 01:22:53.869
The government keeps
track of people like me.

01:22:53.902 --> 01:22:57.773
She's got the best forged
passport I've ever seen.

01:22:57.806 --> 01:23:01.610
The sketch on that napkin?
I knew there was
something about it.

01:23:01.644 --> 01:23:04.447
I had to flirt with my wife
to get this back.

01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:06.515
It's a book I started
writing once.

01:23:06.549 --> 01:23:11.420
Government conspiracies,
the moon landing,
Superbowl 25.

01:23:11.454 --> 01:23:15.091
I'm kidding,
but there was
a Project Nick.

01:23:15.124 --> 01:23:20.296
It involved particle beams,
and plasma, and projects
within projects.

01:23:20.329 --> 01:23:23.332
And one of them
was a version
of Tesla's dream

01:23:23.366 --> 01:23:29.105
to capture, amplify
and transmit the unlimited
energy of the ionosphere.

01:23:29.138 --> 01:23:33.109
Something that could
only be accomplished
on a massive scale.

01:23:34.043 --> 01:23:35.944
Theories.

01:23:35.978 --> 01:23:40.116
There was also reference
to a discontinued offshoot
of that program

01:23:41.517 --> 01:23:42.718
code named Tin Man.

01:23:42.751 --> 01:23:44.920
-Nobody knows.

01:23:45.221 --> 01:23:46.389
I do.

01:23:50.093 --> 01:23:54.197
What Tesla thought he could
do for the energy
in the ionosphere,

01:23:54.230 --> 01:23:59.402
he found he could do
for the energy that exists
around every living thing.

01:24:00.503 --> 01:24:02.438
The energy of a person

01:24:02.471 --> 01:24:04.840
amplified and focused
like a machine.

01:24:06.375 --> 01:24:07.643
Tin Man.

01:24:10.213 --> 01:24:14.283
Imagine a whole
army of soldiers.

01:24:14.317 --> 01:24:15.651
That's why.

01:24:15.684 --> 01:24:18.187
That's why he split it in half.

01:24:18.221 --> 01:24:19.655
Why not destroy it?

01:24:21.990 --> 01:24:23.559
Hope.

01:24:23.592 --> 01:24:28.431
That someday we would
be wise enough to use it
as he intended.

01:24:28.464 --> 01:24:30.866
The hell with hope.
I'm with you. Let it burn.

01:24:39.242 --> 01:24:40.543
I still had hope.

01:24:42.077 --> 01:24:43.179
Oh, shit.

01:24:45.248 --> 01:24:47.516
Well, imagine this
in the wrong hands.

01:24:49.185 --> 01:24:50.886
Or we can end it right here.

01:25:24.353 --> 01:25:26.555
You think this thing
would actually work

01:25:29.692 --> 01:25:31.594
Whenever you look at the moon,

01:25:32.661 --> 01:25:34.563
think of walking on it.

01:25:35.598 --> 01:25:37.099
Some people have.

01:26:17.473 --> 01:26:19.342
I was very glad
to get your call.

01:26:19.375 --> 01:26:22.711
I hope you'll keep in mind
that I've already paid
for this once.

01:26:22.745 --> 01:26:24.747
We're all paying for it.

01:26:24.780 --> 01:26:28.116
You're not still in a fit over
that childhood game of ours.

01:26:28.150 --> 01:26:31.254
Emily and played it
a thousand times.
There's never been any danger.

01:26:31.287 --> 01:26:34.757
I've seen her since.
You practically
took her hand off.

01:26:34.790 --> 01:26:37.260
Paczynski, that Polish, right?

01:26:37.293 --> 01:26:38.927
How'd you crack that code?

01:26:38.961 --> 01:26:42.298
Did you know that
the Polish Underground
would kill their own members

01:26:42.331 --> 01:26:45.534
just to prove
they weren't part
of the Polish Underground?

01:26:45.568 --> 01:26:47.303
They're a very stubborn people.

01:26:48.237 --> 01:26:49.738
Let me see my design.

01:26:55.244 --> 01:26:56.245
What's this?

01:27:01.484 --> 01:27:04.086
My father's weakness
was a curious mind.

01:27:04.119 --> 01:27:05.388
Same thing with Whitmore.

01:27:05.421 --> 01:27:08.691
You're old man got
nicked three times
when the falls were dry.

01:27:08.724 --> 01:27:10.993
That's not curious,
that's driven.

01:27:11.026 --> 01:27:13.829
Little late life to start
thinking, Mr. Paczynski.

01:27:13.862 --> 01:27:16.699
The old tunnels to power house
number one were exposed.

01:27:16.732 --> 01:27:18.901
You've heard one
too many Tesla-ments.

01:27:18.934 --> 01:27:21.737
The quest for the holy grail
armed with a maul ax

01:27:21.770 --> 01:27:23.171
instead of a sword.

01:27:23.205 --> 01:27:25.808
Now, why would he take
a maul ax to the Falls?

01:27:25.841 --> 01:27:27.543
Well, the beauty of a maul ax

01:27:27.576 --> 01:27:29.945
is that one end is wedged
like a hatchet.

01:27:29.978 --> 01:27:35.451
But the other is blunt enough
to bust rock.

01:27:35.484 --> 01:27:39.622
And when the police
released him,
they gave it back.

01:27:40.356 --> 01:27:41.357
Careful.

01:27:44.693 --> 01:27:47.630
You had both halves.
Twice the profit.

01:27:47.663 --> 01:27:49.231
Oh, 100 times.

01:27:49.264 --> 01:27:51.910
But you needed someone
brilliant enough to put
the two halves together.

01:27:51.934 --> 01:27:54.370
And that is a very short list.

01:27:57.806 --> 01:28:01.410
I wouldn't let Nicole Meeker
or anyone like her near it.

01:28:01.444 --> 01:28:04.547
I left a lot of interested
parties very disappointed.

01:28:04.580 --> 01:28:06.349
You don't even know
what you had.

01:28:06.382 --> 01:28:09.652
That design could be
a blue print for free energy.

01:28:09.685 --> 01:28:12.455
It could destroy
the world economy overnight.

01:28:12.488 --> 01:28:15.924
You lecture on the frontier
of science, but you kill
to keep the status quo?

01:28:15.958 --> 01:28:19.328
The fact is that
the design is indecipherable
without both halves.

01:28:19.362 --> 01:28:21.930
I wouldn't dirty
my fingernails
to get it back.

01:28:25.601 --> 01:28:27.970
This can't be the half
your old man found.

01:28:28.003 --> 01:28:29.372
It most certainly is.

01:28:30.172 --> 01:28:31.340
This list,

01:28:32.641 --> 01:28:34.343
it's not my hand writing.

01:28:40.248 --> 01:28:41.283
Nikki!

01:28:46.589 --> 01:28:47.890
Nikki!

01:28:51.927 --> 01:28:53.128
Nikki!

01:28:59.968 --> 01:29:01.003
Nikki!

01:29:18.487 --> 01:29:22.991
*

01:30:57.753 --> 01:30:59.988
Please!

01:31:58.446 --> 01:32:00.015
Last call was 4:00.

01:32:03.586 --> 01:32:04.953
Dude.

01:32:04.987 --> 01:32:07.122
-Get me Mr. Smith.

01:32:35.350 --> 01:32:39.454
After 2:00 a.m.
a man makes nothing
but bad decisions.

01:32:39.487 --> 01:32:41.857
-You smell like the lake.

01:32:41.890 --> 01:32:43.759
Come on,
you and Emily all along?

01:32:43.792 --> 01:32:46.061
Look, I only got
a few laps to go.

01:32:46.094 --> 01:32:48.230
I don't need money.
I want adventure.

01:32:48.263 --> 01:32:49.865
Then why weren't you
in the barrel?

01:32:49.898 --> 01:32:52.968
Jesus and the 12,
is that what
happened to you?

01:32:53.001 --> 01:32:54.102
Where's Nikki?

01:32:54.136 --> 01:32:56.905
The American side?
They sent you over...

01:32:58.506 --> 01:33:00.643
What was it like going
over the brink?

01:33:00.676 --> 01:33:03.045
No points off for being
an reluctant astronaut.

01:33:03.078 --> 01:33:05.113
FBI had everything
but the where.

01:33:05.147 --> 01:33:08.116
Somebody stole the barrel.
Get it?

01:33:08.150 --> 01:33:10.285
The date, the time,
the contact, it's all there.

01:33:10.318 --> 01:33:12.655
0600, 19 September, Celinda!

01:33:12.688 --> 01:33:14.222
You tell me the place!

01:33:14.256 --> 01:33:17.359
God save us
from the gifted amateur.

01:33:18.260 --> 01:33:22.030
Celinda ain't a who.
It's a where.

01:33:22.064 --> 01:33:28.003
Three Sisters.
Asenath, Angeline
and Celinda

01:33:29.972 --> 01:33:31.606
Is this what I think it is?

01:33:33.208 --> 01:33:34.042
Tin Man.

01:33:34.076 --> 01:33:36.879
- Tesla's perfect soldier.
- In theory.

01:33:36.912 --> 01:33:39.181
In practice.

01:33:42.751 --> 01:33:45.053
The only thing
more valuable is...

01:33:47.055 --> 01:33:48.523
Someone to put it together.

01:33:50.458 --> 01:33:51.660
I'll drive.

01:33:56.799 --> 01:33:58.233
Go, man, go

01:34:14.149 --> 01:34:20.155
*

01:34:44.512 --> 01:34:46.281
Nikki!

01:34:46.314 --> 01:34:47.850
Charlie, hurry there's no time.

01:34:47.883 --> 01:34:48.884
It's over.

01:34:48.917 --> 01:34:50.552
My brother's men are coming.

01:34:50.585 --> 01:34:52.687
-It's finished.

01:35:01.396 --> 01:35:04.166
Nikki let's go. Go!

01:35:17.079 --> 01:35:20.148
Where are
you taking me?
Just keep walking.

01:35:28.924 --> 01:35:32.527
*

01:36:06.028 --> 01:36:08.296
Whitmore has part of the plan.

01:36:08.330 --> 01:36:11.299
- Don't believe him.
- Whitmore is a government agent.

01:36:11.333 --> 01:36:13.135
She'll never believe you.

01:36:13.168 --> 01:36:15.137
The design was just bent, Nikki.

01:36:15.170 --> 01:36:18.273
You're worth more to them.
Someone who can solve
all their problems.

01:36:20.008 --> 01:36:21.609
Well, they could never make me.

01:36:24.379 --> 01:36:26.514
She can't be smart
about everything!

01:36:27.749 --> 01:36:28.783
- Go!
- No

01:36:28.817 --> 01:36:29.784
- Move!
- Go!

01:36:29.818 --> 01:36:31.086
-Go!

01:36:31.119 --> 01:36:33.155
You can't get in the way too.

01:36:33.188 --> 01:36:34.489
-Charlie!

01:36:42.831 --> 01:36:43.866
Come on!

01:36:59.948 --> 01:37:01.283
You need a doctor.

01:37:01.316 --> 01:37:03.518
You gotta get out of here.
And don't look back.

01:37:03.551 --> 01:37:04.987
Just rest.

01:37:05.020 --> 01:37:08.123
You drew the half
you'd never seen.

01:37:08.156 --> 01:37:10.225
Lot of people
want a piece of you.

01:37:11.126 --> 01:37:13.161
Well, they have
a pattern of you.

01:37:14.162 --> 01:37:15.730
There's a joker in every deck.

01:37:19.234 --> 01:37:23.238
Well, actually, there's two.

01:37:50.732 --> 01:37:51.833
Where is it?

01:37:53.668 --> 01:37:54.937
She burned it.

01:37:56.905 --> 01:37:59.307
That would be a great loss.

01:38:02.710 --> 01:38:03.811
If it were true.

01:38:49.791 --> 01:38:53.996
*

01:40:06.401 --> 01:40:09.471
Paczynski, it's for you.

01:41:34.922 --> 01:41:40.895
*

01:42:26.574 --> 01:42:28.976
* Wish you were here

01:42:30.212 --> 01:42:33.248
* To whisper in my years

01:42:33.281 --> 01:42:35.683
* That you love me

01:42:35.717 --> 01:42:38.052
* More than words can tell

01:42:40.888 --> 01:42:43.691
* I can't forget

01:42:44.459 --> 01:42:47.462
* The day that we met

01:42:47.495 --> 01:42:50.198
* Heeded what you mean

01:42:50.232 --> 01:42:52.267
* More than words can tell

01:42:55.337 --> 01:42:58.306
* Can you forget

01:42:58.340 --> 01:43:01.243
* What I've done in the past?

01:43:02.510 --> 01:43:05.447
* Please forgive me

01:43:05.480 --> 01:43:08.816
* And give me one more chance

01:43:09.517 --> 01:43:12.019
* Wish you were here

01:43:12.954 --> 01:43:15.957
* I'd whisper in your ear

01:43:15.990 --> 01:43:20.928
* That I love you
More than words can tell *

01:43:38.179 --> 01:43:40.948
* Can you forget

01:43:40.982 --> 01:43:44.051
* What I've done in the past?

01:43:44.952 --> 01:43:47.289
* Please forgive me
