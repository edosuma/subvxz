WEBVTT

00:04.546 --> 00:07.881
This kitty is Mittens.
This one is Fitzhugh.

00:08.048 --> 00:10.968
And this little guy
in the cat condo is Jinkies.

00:12.262 --> 00:16.473
Yeah. That's a lot of cats, Jo Lynn.

00:16.641 --> 00:17.766
Single, are you?

00:20.687 --> 00:21.729
Chandler Bing.

00:21.896 --> 00:24.189
Hey. You're answering your own phone?

00:24.357 --> 00:25.524
Where's your crazy assistant?

00:29.362 --> 00:30.404
What's up, Joe?

00:30.613 --> 00:32.740
Okay, what have we always wanted
to do together?

00:32.991 --> 00:36.577
Braid each other's hair
and ride horseback on the beach?

00:36.745 --> 00:39.163
No. No. No. When you get home
tomorrow night...

00:39.330 --> 00:42.708
...you and I are gonna be
at the Wizards-Knicks game, courtside.

00:42.917 --> 00:44.376
- Courtside? Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

00:44.586 --> 00:48.380
Maybe Michael Jordan will dive for the ball
and break my jaw with his knee.

00:48.631 --> 00:50.883
That is so cool. I'll let Monica know.

00:54.596 --> 00:56.055
- Hello?
- Joey just called.

00:56.222 --> 00:59.266
He's got courtside Knicks tickets
for him and me tomorrow night.

00:59.476 --> 01:02.853
Really? But tomorrow night's the only night
I get off from the restaurant.

01:03.021 --> 01:05.606
If you go, we won't have a night together
for another week.

01:05.774 --> 01:10.027
But honey, it's courtside.
The cheerleaders are gonna be right in f...

01:10.653 --> 01:13.072
That's not the way to convince you.

01:13.239 --> 01:15.407
Chandler, I don't wanna be
one of those wives that says:

01:15.575 --> 01:18.494
"You can't go to the game.
You have to spend time with me."

01:18.661 --> 01:21.038
So if you could just realize it
on your own...

01:22.123 --> 01:25.250
I know. You're right.
I wanna see you too.

01:25.418 --> 01:28.587
I just gotta figure out a way to tell Joey.
He's really looking forward to this.

01:28.755 --> 01:31.256
Tell him you haven't seen
your wife in a long time.

01:31.466 --> 01:35.302
Tell him that having a long-distance
relationship is really difficult.

01:35.470 --> 01:39.598
Tell him that what little time
we have together is precious.

01:40.058 --> 01:42.434
Eh, yeah, I'll think of something.

02:26.771 --> 02:30.858
Wow. Heh. Wow, you look, uh...

02:32.735 --> 02:36.947
I mean, it's just, uh... That dress, uh...

02:37.365 --> 02:40.075
Well, I hope the ends
of these sentences are good.

02:40.243 --> 02:43.453
Heh. Oh, they're good. It's just been
a while since I've seen you like this.

02:43.621 --> 02:45.622
You clean up good.

02:45.832 --> 02:48.125
Oh, really? Well, thank you.

02:53.089 --> 02:54.965
Okay, stop. Stop looking at me like that.

02:55.175 --> 02:58.051
- Last time that happened, that happened.
- Oh, right, right.

03:03.641 --> 03:07.519
So are you excited about
your first night away from Emma?

03:07.687 --> 03:10.189
Yeah, yeah. Phoebe and I
are gonna have so much fun.

03:10.356 --> 03:13.275
- And thank you for watching the baby.
- Oh, it's fine.

03:13.443 --> 03:15.569
Actually, I invited Mike over.

03:15.737 --> 03:16.778
- Phoebe's Mike?
- Yeah.

03:17.071 --> 03:19.072
- I didn't know you guys hung out.
- We don't...

03:19.282 --> 03:21.200
...but I thought it'd be nice
to get to know him.

03:21.367 --> 03:24.203
Maybe have a little dinner,
drinks, conversation.

03:24.412 --> 03:27.122
Oh, that's so cute.
Ross and Mike's first date.

03:29.125 --> 03:31.752
Is that gonna be awkward?
What are you guys gonna talk about?

03:31.961 --> 03:34.588
I don't know. But you know,
we have a lot in common, you know?

03:34.756 --> 03:38.467
Um, he plays piano.
I played keyboards in college.

03:39.469 --> 03:43.805
Uh, he's been divorced.
I have some experience in that area.

03:46.100 --> 03:48.185
- Yeah?
- Hi.

03:49.062 --> 03:50.354
- Hi.
- Hi.

03:50.521 --> 03:54.024
Ooh. Girls' night out indeed.

03:54.192 --> 03:56.652
Okay, so I think Emma is probably
down for the night...

03:56.819 --> 03:59.029
...but if you need anything...
- Rach, we'll be fine.

03:59.197 --> 04:01.114
- You go have fun.
- Okay, you too.

04:01.282 --> 04:03.659
- Thanks.
- And I hope you score.

04:03.993 --> 04:06.411
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

04:06.579 --> 04:09.164
So, welcome.

04:09.749 --> 04:13.126
- I got beer.
- I got bottled breast milk.

04:14.796 --> 04:17.964
- Eh, why don't we start with the beer?
- Okay.

04:21.219 --> 04:25.305
So, um, ahem,
Phoebe tells me you, uh, play piano.

04:25.473 --> 04:26.556
Yeah.

04:26.724 --> 04:28.850
You know, I used to, uh,
play keyboards in college.

04:29.060 --> 04:30.727
Oh. Do you have one here?

04:32.355 --> 04:33.939
No.

04:34.857 --> 04:36.775
Okay. Heh.

04:42.615 --> 04:44.283
Ah.

04:52.834 --> 04:57.337
Um, uh, you know, I'm divorced.

04:57.505 --> 05:01.174
Uh, Phoebe... Phoebe says you're...
You've been divorced?

05:01.342 --> 05:03.552
Yeah, yeah.

05:03.761 --> 05:06.638
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I don't really like to talk about it.

05:10.018 --> 05:13.562
That's okay.
We'll talk about something else.

05:22.405 --> 05:24.865
- So you're a paleontologist, right?
- Yeah.

05:25.033 --> 05:27.034
- My cousin's a paleontologist.
- Ah.

05:31.831 --> 05:35.876
Well, he and I would probably have
a lot to talk about.

05:39.756 --> 05:40.964
- Hi.
- Hey.

05:41.257 --> 05:43.633
- Welcome home.
- Oh, well, look at you.

05:43.801 --> 05:45.469
Yeah. What do you think?

05:45.887 --> 05:47.888
Well, it looks great. It's just...

05:48.056 --> 05:51.350
Well, I'm wearing the same thing
underneath, so...

05:51.726 --> 05:53.685
You see what I mean? Heh.

05:55.188 --> 05:58.648
Hey. How come your door's locked?

05:58.816 --> 06:00.776
- Just a second.
- No, no, no.

06:00.943 --> 06:02.611
- Joey can't know that I'm here.
- Why not?

06:02.779 --> 06:05.197
I didn't know how to tell him
I couldn't go to the game...

06:05.365 --> 06:08.575
...so I told him I had to stay in Tulsa.
- So you lied to him?

06:08.785 --> 06:12.579
It's always better to lie than to have
the complicated discussion.

06:14.248 --> 06:15.916
Except with you.

06:17.335 --> 06:19.336
Hey, open the door. What's going on?

06:24.550 --> 06:26.051
- What are you...?
- Hi.

06:26.219 --> 06:28.220
Why are you dressed like that?

06:29.806 --> 06:32.557
Because, um, well, Chandler's
gonna be home in a couple of days...

06:32.725 --> 06:36.561
...so I thought I would just, um, you know,
practice the art of seduction.

06:36.896 --> 06:38.897
I thought I heard a man's voice before.

06:39.065 --> 06:41.817
No, I was just doing Chandler's side
of the conversation.

06:41.984 --> 06:44.319
You know, like, "Hi, how do I look?"

06:44.487 --> 06:47.531
"Really sexy.
Could I be any more turned on?"

06:47.698 --> 06:48.782
You know.

06:49.367 --> 06:51.076
Okay. Wait a minute.

06:51.244 --> 06:53.203
Why are there two glasses
of wine out?

06:53.746 --> 06:55.747
Because one of them is for you.

07:00.253 --> 07:03.130
Cheers. Okay, bye-bye.

07:04.799 --> 07:09.594
You know, it's funny. I've been, uh,
practicing the art of seduction myself.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.433
- You might wanna keep practicing.
- Yeah.

07:16.477 --> 07:19.354
- It's Joey.
- What?

07:19.522 --> 07:22.524
- Hey, Joe.
- Dude, come home.

07:24.110 --> 07:27.779
- What? Why?
- Come home.

07:27.989 --> 07:29.823
Look, I can't. What's going on?

07:30.032 --> 07:33.827
I don't know how to tell you this,
but, uh, I think Monica's cheating on you.

07:33.995 --> 07:36.955
I told you you shouldn't have married
someone so much hotter than you.

07:40.209 --> 07:42.502
All right, if you can't deal with this,
then I'm gonna.

07:42.712 --> 07:45.046
- No.
- I just heard him.

07:46.424 --> 07:48.967
Can you hear him now?

07:51.304 --> 07:53.513
No. All right, I'm going in.

07:53.723 --> 07:55.307
- No, wait.
- I heard him again.

07:58.811 --> 08:01.062
All right, look, just stay there.
I'm coming home.

08:01.272 --> 08:02.772
Okay, I'll see you when you get here.

08:02.940 --> 08:05.192
I'm gonna wait out in the hall
in case the dude comes out.

08:05.902 --> 08:08.862
- Is that really necessary?
- Absolutely. You'd do it for me.

08:09.030 --> 08:13.658
Not that you ever have to, because
I know how to keep my women satisfied.

08:25.296 --> 08:27.631
Shouldn't the pizza be here by now?

08:27.798 --> 08:33.428
I mean, they said 30 minutes or less.
Well, how long has it been?

08:34.597 --> 08:36.972
Eleven minutes.

08:43.022 --> 08:44.940
And now 12.

08:48.736 --> 08:52.781
- So you like the beer?
- I do. I do.

08:52.949 --> 08:56.701
- Although, it's actually a lager.
- Huh.

08:59.747 --> 09:01.873
What's the difference
between beer and lager?

09:02.083 --> 09:04.626
I don't know.

09:06.295 --> 09:07.546
We could look it up.

09:09.423 --> 09:12.133
Things are about to get wild.

09:18.182 --> 09:20.725
Oh, God, remember the girls' nights
we used to have...

09:20.893 --> 09:22.852
...sitting around talking
about you and Ross?

09:23.020 --> 09:25.605
Oh, God. It seems like forever ago.

09:25.773 --> 09:26.815
I know.

09:27.066 --> 09:30.610
Ah. So, what's going on
with you and Ross?

09:31.404 --> 09:36.449
Well, um, I don't know.
I mean, for a long time, nothing.

09:36.617 --> 09:40.412
But, you know, actually,
right before you picked me up...

09:40.580 --> 09:43.123
...Ross and I had a, uh, little thing.

09:43.332 --> 09:46.293
Oh, my God. I love things.
What happened?

09:46.502 --> 09:49.379
Well, um, first he told me
he liked how I looked.

09:49.547 --> 09:53.842
- Uh-huh.
- And, uh, then we had a little, um...

09:54.969 --> 09:57.220
...eye contact.

09:58.639 --> 09:59.848
- Eye contact?
- Mm-hm.

10:00.057 --> 10:01.808
I hope you were using protection.

10:03.728 --> 10:09.482
Excuse me, um, these are from
the two gentlemen at the end of the bar.

10:09.900 --> 10:13.486
Should we send them something back?
Ooh, let's send them mashed potatoes.

10:13.696 --> 10:15.030
No, wait. Don't do that.

10:15.197 --> 10:17.198
That's gonna make them think
they can come over.

10:17.408 --> 10:18.700
So, what if they do?

10:18.909 --> 10:24.331
We're not here to meet guys. You have
a boyfriend. I have a baby and a Ross.

10:24.582 --> 10:29.085
Yeah, but nothing has to happen.
We're just having fun.

10:29.253 --> 10:33.298
You know, not everything
has to go as far as eye contact.

10:35.301 --> 10:37.969
Chandler, you have to tell Joey
that you're not in Tulsa.

10:38.179 --> 10:40.889
Don't you think it's better for him
to think you're cheating on me...

10:41.057 --> 10:43.475
...than for him to think
I'm cheating on him?

10:44.101 --> 10:45.894
I heard it.

10:46.395 --> 10:48.855
I don't want him to think
that I'm having an affair.

10:49.607 --> 10:52.317
All right, I've got a plan.
I'll go down the fire escape...

10:52.526 --> 10:55.695
Because all good plans start with,
"I'll go down the fire escape."

10:55.905 --> 10:57.280
Hear me out, woman.

10:59.075 --> 11:01.159
I'll go down the fire escape, then I'll wait.

11:01.369 --> 11:03.870
Then when I come up the stairs
it'll be like I just got back.

11:04.038 --> 11:07.040
Then Joey and I will come in
and see that there's no guy in here.

11:07.249 --> 11:10.669
Aren't you afraid that Joey's
gonna figure all this out?

11:13.923 --> 11:15.465
I heard it.

11:23.307 --> 11:25.350
- I'm just gonna wait.
- The scary pigeon's back?

11:25.559 --> 11:27.644
It's huge.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.054
Oh, my God. I can't believe
you live in that building.

12:03.222 --> 12:04.889
My grandmother lives in that building.

12:05.057 --> 12:07.475
Ida Green?
No sense of personal space...

12:07.643 --> 12:10.145
...kind of smells like chicken,
looks like a potato.

12:10.354 --> 12:13.064
- "Spuds" is your grandmother?
- That's my bubby.

12:16.360 --> 12:18.528
So we're on our way
to a couple of parties.

12:18.696 --> 12:22.782
Um, maybe we can get your numbers
and call if we find something fun?

12:23.576 --> 12:26.828
Yeah. I'm sorry, we weren't really
looking for anything to happen...

12:26.996 --> 12:29.539
...with you guys. I have a boyfriend.

12:29.832 --> 12:31.875
- All right.
- It's no big deal.

12:33.878 --> 12:38.381
So she has a boyfriend.
What is your situation?

12:38.799 --> 12:42.343
Oh, well, it's complicated.
I don't actually have a boyfriend, but, uh...

12:42.553 --> 12:45.054
Then can I have your number?

12:45.681 --> 12:47.390
I'm sorry, no.

12:47.850 --> 12:48.933
Okay.

12:49.435 --> 12:51.227
Oh, sure.

12:53.147 --> 12:54.856
Oh, my God, you're giving
your real number.

12:58.068 --> 13:00.528
Okay, thanks.
I'll give you a call later tonight.

13:00.738 --> 13:02.614
- Great.
- Bye.

13:02.782 --> 13:04.032
Bye.

13:04.867 --> 13:07.702
Wow. So that's great.

13:07.870 --> 13:11.581
You, Bill, Ross and Emma
are gonna be so happy together.

13:11.749 --> 13:13.166
What were you thinking?

13:13.375 --> 13:16.795
I don't know. He was cute and he liked me.
It was an impulse.

13:16.962 --> 13:19.214
But what about Ross?
What about your moment?

13:19.381 --> 13:21.424
- Don't you wanna talk to Ross about it?
- No.

13:21.592 --> 13:24.719
No, because I know exactly
how the conversation's gonna go.

13:24.887 --> 13:27.931
"Hey, Ross, you know,
I think we had a moment before."

13:28.098 --> 13:31.392
"Yeah. Ahem. Me too."

13:31.560 --> 13:34.938
"Well, but I'm not sure
I really want to do anything about it."

13:35.105 --> 13:37.732
"Yeah. Ahem. Me neither."

13:38.234 --> 13:40.318
"Should we just live together...

13:40.486 --> 13:42.445
...and not tell each other
how we're feeling?"

13:42.613 --> 13:44.322
"Yeah, that works for me."

13:47.284 --> 13:49.202
Yeah, I see what you mean.

13:49.370 --> 13:52.664
By the way, nice Ross imitation.

13:52.832 --> 13:54.374
But your Rachel wasn't whiny enough.

13:54.583 --> 13:56.042
- What? Hey.
- Better.

13:58.671 --> 14:02.674
The point is maybe I should just stop
waiting around for moments with Ross.

14:02.842 --> 14:06.052
You know?
I should just move on with my life.

14:06.262 --> 14:09.138
So really, you're moving on from Ross?

14:09.306 --> 14:11.641
I don't know.
Do I have to decide right now?

14:11.809 --> 14:14.769
You kind of just did.
That guy is gonna call you tonight.

14:14.937 --> 14:17.939
Ross is gonna pick up the phone,
and that's a pretty clear message.

14:18.148 --> 14:19.858
Oh, my God, Ross.

14:20.025 --> 14:22.151
Ross is gonna pick up the phone.

14:22.319 --> 14:25.363
Oh, I have to get my number back.
Oh, my God, he's gone.

14:25.573 --> 14:28.491
"Oh, I have to get
my number back. Oh, my God. He's gone."

14:28.659 --> 14:29.909
Dead on.

14:44.550 --> 14:47.927
- You know, I'm gonna take off.
- So soon?

14:48.095 --> 14:49.470
- Yeah.
- Okay.

14:49.638 --> 14:52.181
Well, thanks, uh... Thanks for the beer.

14:52.349 --> 14:56.019
- You mean lager?
- Ah, yeah. Good times.

15:09.575 --> 15:11.826
- Hello?
- Hey, Mike, it's me.

15:11.994 --> 15:13.912
Listen, is, um... Is Ross near you?

15:14.121 --> 15:15.663
Uh, no, I just left.

15:15.873 --> 15:17.624
Well, you have to go back in.

15:18.417 --> 15:23.046
What? Go back?
To the land where time stands still?

15:23.756 --> 15:25.381
I'm so sorry, honey, but...

15:25.549 --> 15:27.550
Okay, Rachel gave this guy
her number...

15:27.718 --> 15:30.053
...and, um, she doesn't want Ross
to answer the phone.

15:30.220 --> 15:32.221
So you have to intercept all his calls.

15:32.806 --> 15:33.932
I can't do that.

15:34.141 --> 15:37.143
- He says he can't do that.
- Oh, give me the phone.

15:37.311 --> 15:40.980
Hi, Mike. Hi, listen, I know that this
is a lot to ask, but you know what?

15:41.148 --> 15:46.527
If you do this,
Phoebe will do anything you want.

15:46.695 --> 15:50.907
- Seriously, I'm talking dirty stuff.
- All right. Thank you. Hello?

15:51.075 --> 15:54.953
Hi, I'm sorry about her. But actually,
she wasn't wrong about the dirty stuff.

15:56.997 --> 15:58.539
All right, I'll do it.

15:59.500 --> 16:03.419
But really, how much dirtier can it get?

16:04.004 --> 16:06.756
Oh, Mike.

16:07.758 --> 16:09.467
Bye.

16:14.014 --> 16:15.807
Hey, buddy.

16:17.101 --> 16:19.394
Uh, hi.

16:19.561 --> 16:23.106
- Um, can I come back in?
- Why?

16:24.525 --> 16:30.154
Well, I was just thinking about
how much more we have to talk about.

16:30.698 --> 16:33.032
But you left.

16:38.205 --> 16:39.831
Wow, that didn't take long.

16:40.040 --> 16:43.001
I thought you said Tulsa
was like a three-hour flight?

16:44.461 --> 16:48.172
Well, you're forgetting
about the time difference.

16:56.348 --> 16:57.849
Yeah.

16:59.852 --> 17:00.893
Chandler, you're home.

17:01.061 --> 17:05.522
That's right. Your husband's home.
So now the sex can stop.

17:10.820 --> 17:11.988
What are you saying?

17:12.196 --> 17:14.031
Joey said you're in here
with another man.

17:14.241 --> 17:17.993
There's no man in here.
How dare you accuse me of that.

17:20.372 --> 17:21.414
All right. All right.

17:21.582 --> 17:26.169
Then maybe you won't mind if me
and my friend take a look around, huh?

17:29.506 --> 17:30.548
What's he doing?

17:30.758 --> 17:33.051
I arranged some pillows on the bed
to look like a guy.

17:36.055 --> 17:40.308
Bedroom's clear. Although
you might need some new pillows.

17:41.060 --> 17:44.103
All right, well, I'll check the guest room.

17:51.779 --> 17:53.988
Why do I smell men's cologne?

17:56.200 --> 17:58.367
I think that's you.

18:00.871 --> 18:04.540
Oh, yeah. I rubbed a magazine
on myself earlier.

18:06.085 --> 18:07.752
There's nobody here, Joe.

18:08.545 --> 18:09.587
I guess not.

18:09.963 --> 18:14.383
I can't believe you thought I was cheating.
You owe me an apology.

18:14.843 --> 18:17.512
- You're right, Monica. I'm so sorry.
- It's an honest mistake.

18:17.679 --> 18:19.806
It could happen to anybody.
All right, see you.

18:19.973 --> 18:22.391
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

18:22.559 --> 18:26.729
If you just got back from Tulsa,
how did your suitcase beat you here?

18:30.400 --> 18:33.778
I climbed down the fire escape,
and you can't put that in the closet?

18:37.866 --> 18:40.660
So with the exception
of the fermentation process...

18:40.828 --> 18:44.247
...beer and ale
are basically the same thing.

18:45.207 --> 18:47.458
Fascinating, isn't it?

18:48.001 --> 18:51.462
Maybe you should look up "fascinating."

18:53.006 --> 18:54.674
I'll get it.

18:59.763 --> 19:03.766
Hello? Ross' place. Mike speaking.

19:05.644 --> 19:07.061
It's for you.

19:11.066 --> 19:14.318
I don't understand
what just happened here.

19:16.697 --> 19:18.406
What's going on?

19:18.574 --> 19:19.699
I'm sorry.

19:19.867 --> 19:23.995
I told you I was in Tulsa because I wanted
to spend the night with Monica...

19:24.163 --> 19:27.999
...and I didn't know...
I didn't think you'd understand.

19:28.292 --> 19:32.879
You think I'm too dumb to understand
a husband needs to be with his wife? Huh?

19:33.046 --> 19:36.174
You think I'm, like, duh.

19:38.594 --> 19:41.304
- Joey?
- Yeah.

19:41.680 --> 19:44.849
I don't know what to say.
We shouldn't have lied to you.

19:45.017 --> 19:48.311
Yeah, I feel so bad. Is there anything
I can do to make it up to you?

19:50.772 --> 19:54.150
Yeah, you could go to the game with me.
Even though you said you couldn't.

19:54.318 --> 19:58.779
But then you lied to me and tricked me
and gave me a bump on the head.

19:59.031 --> 20:02.867
I'm sorry, that's the one thing I can't do.
I promised I'd be with Monica.

20:03.493 --> 20:04.785
All right.

20:05.537 --> 20:07.330
- You can go.
- What?

20:07.497 --> 20:10.333
You should go to the game.
It's okay. I want you to.

20:10.792 --> 20:13.461
- Really? You gonna be okay?
- Yeah, I'll be fine.

20:13.795 --> 20:17.465
You know, maybe I'll stay here
and practice the art of seduction.

20:17.716 --> 20:22.261
- You're gonna put sweats on and clean.
- It's gonna be so hot.

20:22.679 --> 20:23.888
- Bye.
- Bye.

20:24.056 --> 20:25.223
Thanks.

20:26.141 --> 20:27.558
Here's your ticket.

20:27.726 --> 20:29.936
Thanks. Hey, listen...

20:30.103 --> 20:32.730
...I'm never gonna lie to you again, okay?

20:32.940 --> 20:36.192
And I want you to know
that nobody thinks you're stupid.

20:36.860 --> 20:38.069
Thanks, man.

20:41.365 --> 20:44.700
- Where you going?
- Game's tomorrow night, Joe.

20:49.539 --> 20:51.332
- Hi.
- Hi.

20:51.500 --> 20:54.335
Oh, God. So glad you're back.

20:57.089 --> 20:58.714
So, what did you guys do?

20:58.924 --> 21:01.717
Oh, you know, we just drank some beer.

21:01.885 --> 21:04.595
Mike played with the boundaries
of normal social conduct.

21:06.014 --> 21:08.683
It's true, I did.

21:09.559 --> 21:10.601
- Well, goodbye.
- Okay.

21:10.811 --> 21:13.396
- Bye. That was fun, Pheebs.
- I know. It was fun.

21:13.563 --> 21:15.356
See you, guys.

21:15.524 --> 21:17.733
Rachel, lock the door.
Lock the door, seriously.

21:19.403 --> 21:22.071
Oh, shoot, I forgot to pay Phoebe
for the drinks.

21:24.116 --> 21:27.493
Wait, wait. Wait, sorry.
Did he call? Did that guy call?

21:27.661 --> 21:29.161
No, just his mom.

21:29.371 --> 21:30.579
Oh. Around 8:30?

21:30.789 --> 21:32.373
- Yeah.
- Then again at 9:00?

21:32.582 --> 21:34.792
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

21:40.257 --> 21:42.008
Hello?

21:42.676 --> 21:46.012
Uh, no, she's not here right now.
Can I take a message?

21:46.847 --> 21:49.432
Bill from the bar?

21:51.018 --> 21:56.022
Okay, Bill from the bar,
I'll make sure she gets your number.

22:04.239 --> 22:05.781
Ah.

22:07.576 --> 22:09.910
So, uh... So how was it?

22:10.078 --> 22:12.204
Did you guys...?
You guys have a good time?

22:12.372 --> 22:16.876
We had so much fun.
It felt so good to be out.

22:19.671 --> 22:21.297
Uh, Rach?

22:21.465 --> 22:23.215
Yeah?

22:26.345 --> 22:27.511
Never mind.

22:35.854 --> 22:36.896
- Hey, you guys.
- Hey.

22:37.064 --> 22:38.481
Hey.

22:38.648 --> 22:42.193
I'll be right back.
I gotta go to the bathroom.

22:56.792 --> 22:59.168
Stout. That's a kind of beer.
