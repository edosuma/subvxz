02:01.554 --> 02:02.721
Are you ok there, boy?

02:02.721 --> 02:06.217
Ted is presenting his  new features at drift racing to freddie today i think he's got butterflies

02:06.217 --> 02:10.477
I don't have butterflies, I've got DRAGONFLIES!

02:10.477 --> 02:14.987
We don't need your presentation, imma tell him right now

02:24.381 --> 02:26.290
Oh there's Jenny

02:30.095 --> 02:31.286
I'm probably gonna go talk to her

02:31.286 --> 02:33.394
Yeah I probably  should pretend to not sit Ted for a few seconds

02:33.394 --> 02:35.860
then wheel him into Freddie's room

02:35.860 --> 02:38.342
Yeah, don't let him eat anything in there, ok

02:38.342 --> 02:39.680
right

03:03.576 --> 03:06.012
Heey

03:09.531 --> 03:10.971
about today's daily dean

03:10.971 --> 03:13.316
Whatever, Games Dean is an idiot

03:13.316 --> 03:16.519
Right? Yeah he is! Total!

03:20.795 --> 03:21.678
You beat it

03:21.678 --> 03:23.966
Oh yeah, all your highscores too

03:23.966 --> 03:25.051
Great

03:25.051 --> 03:26.277
Oh don't worry it wasn't hard

03:26.277 --> 03:29.249
Oh! So basically I suck

03:29.249 --> 03:30.840
Yeah ehm

03:30.840 --> 03:33.819
speaking of that

03:33.819 --> 03:35.660
We can't really hang out anymore

03:37.905 --> 03:39.022
What?

03:39.022 --> 03:40.675
Or be friends

03:40.675 --> 03:42.598
now that came out wrong

03:43.213 --> 03:47.960
Brian I think that you're cool but The Law is Varsity captain

03:47.960 --> 03:50.413
and my parents expect me to make the team

03:50.413 --> 03:53.239
so i can't have people talking about you and me

03:56.194 --> 03:58.154
so wait wait wait

03:58.154 --> 04:03.628
you're telling me that Law won't put you on the team because he thinks that you and I

04:06.502 --> 04:08.677
just answered my question

04:08.697 --> 04:10.097
wow

04:10.915 --> 04:12.671
so are we cool?

04:12.671 --> 04:17.027
cool? No! we're not cool we're like the opposite of cool like

04:18.765 --> 04:20.745
Jenny when you and i played last night it was

04:20.745 --> 04:24.895
awesome, I know

04:24.895 --> 04:27.639
I'm sorry, I have to go

04:37.395 --> 04:43.071
And that is why i am going to sign up for drift racing this year

04:43.071 --> 04:45.089
I love you dad

04:45.089 --> 04:46.427
Mr. Wong

04:46.427 --> 04:49.137
we all know Ted will never be a great rythm gamer

04:49.137 --> 04:52.055
he just needs to hear you say it

04:52.993 --> 04:55.586
you'll never be a great rythm gamer

04:55.586 --> 04:56.294
i knew it

04:56.294 --> 04:57.501
and that concludes our meeting!

04:57.501 --> 04:59.490
You know how many losers told me that

04:59.490 --> 05:01.648
on my way to the top?

05:01.648 --> 05:03.254
pro shredders aren't born, Ted

05:03.254 --> 05:06.919
they are forged to the fire and the flames

05:06.919 --> 05:07.615
Really?

05:07.615 --> 05:08.722
of course

05:08.722 --> 05:10.179
see you're a Wong

05:10.179 --> 05:12.660
you're born to be a pro shredder

05:12.660 --> 05:15.907
the reason I bust your chops is because i know you've got what it takes

05:15.907 --> 05:16.838
I got it

05:16.838 --> 05:19.287
i knew you really cared

05:19.287 --> 05:21.973
Now stop whammering and start hammering

05:21.973 --> 05:24.335
on that is, practice-wise

05:24.335 --> 05:26.338
hey, see you at the sign-ups

05:26.338 --> 05:30.389
i won't let you down this year

05:30.389 --> 05:32.060
Thanks Ki-wy

05:32.060 --> 05:35.341
The presentation was tops!

05:39.378 --> 05:40.734
So

05:40.734 --> 05:43.977
you're Ted's first groupie

05:43.977 --> 05:46.682
Ki Swan 1360 points

05:46.682 --> 05:50.257
fighter

05:50.257 --> 05:53.418
I don't like you

05:53.418 --> 05:56.578
On to the wise Ki-wy

05:56.578 --> 05:59.712
you've been his lady for what... a week?

05:59.712 --> 06:03.435
I'm his father twice a month a weekend for his entire life

06:03.435 --> 06:05.862
Ted stays where he belongs, you hear me

06:05.862 --> 06:08.132
IN MY SHADOW!

06:08.132 --> 06:11.756
Attention players, one hour left to sign ups for clan try-outs

06:11.756 --> 06:18.153
choose your team carefully because once you swipe that card your fate  is sealed

06:20.867 --> 06:22.239
Brian hey!

06:22.239 --> 06:24.906
are you to top off my lemonade or...

06:24.906 --> 06:27.220
oh wait, I'm sorry, That's why i have her

06:27.220 --> 06:28.294

06:36.169 --> 06:39.158
Here's the deal Brian

06:39.158 --> 06:43.120
i did you a favour by sparing your life, remember?

06:43.120 --> 06:46.934
so now you're going to do me a favor by not signing up

06:46.934 --> 06:52.706
sorry Law, the favour train has left the station

06:52.706 --> 06:55.649
Last chance tanner-tom

06:55.649 --> 06:58.291
are you sure you want to do this?

06:58.291 --> 07:02.567
What would you do Law?

07:02.567 --> 07:04.571
I think you would sign up

07:04.571 --> 07:06.333
but you're not The Law!

07:06.333 --> 07:09.903
Are you?

07:09.903 --> 07:12.487
Believe me Brian, i get it

07:12.487 --> 07:14.778
you want to be this

07:14.778 --> 07:17.201
Listen to Law's lesson, loser

07:17.201 --> 07:20.794

07:28.809 --> 07:31.903
Ehm... Check me by the way

07:31.903 --> 07:34.561

07:34.561 --> 07:37.456
but wait, there's more!

You want to be The Law?

07:56.226 --> 07:59.589
Well you've got  to get through The Law first

07:59.589 --> 08:01.196
Hey Ki!

I have to get to the fighting sign-ups Ted

08:25.577 --> 08:26.823
It's cool Ki

08:28.747 --> 08:29.706
Hey guys how is it going?

08:29.706 --> 08:32.467
Ted for rythm gaming this year came to join the team finally

08:32.467 --> 08:35.496

08:35.496 --> 08:38.813
How me suffer why?

08:38.813 --> 08:40.504
Because

08:40.504 --> 08:41.744
I

08:41.744 --> 08:46.522
Oh my god, The Law is trolling Brian D

08:46.522 --> 08:47.522
I gotta go help my friend

08:47.522 --> 08:48.294
goodbye guys

08:48.294 --> 08:50.491
KEEP ALL MY STUFF

08:50.491 --> 08:56.629
That guy should litterally be doing anything but rythm gaming

09:05.060 --> 09:07.039
Why are you doing this?

09:07.039 --> 09:09.538
you've already proved you're better than me

09:09.538 --> 09:11.646
Brian, dude

09:11.646 --> 09:13.101
It's because i can

09:13.101 --> 09:14.581
because

09:15.181 --> 09:17.668
it's fun

09:17.668 --> 09:19.023
And because you

09:19.023 --> 09:20.450
made it personal

09:20.450 --> 09:22.148
the spotlight wasn't enough

09:22.148 --> 09:24.204
so you had to move in on my girl

09:24.204 --> 09:25.630
dude, we're just...

09:26.445 --> 09:27.772
we're not even friends

09:27.772 --> 09:28.501
Whatever

09:28.501 --> 09:30.081
So on to you

09:30.081 --> 09:33.124

10:00.217 --> 10:02.186

10:09.728 --> 10:11.807
This is too good for you Law?

10:11.807 --> 10:14.164
Oh my god

10:17.270 --> 10:19.026
Somebody S my D

Stay away from him

10:20.055 --> 10:23.190

10:26.061 --> 10:30.132
Okay, I've got your back

10:53.257 --> 10:55.485
What are you waiting for? Let's go!

10:55.700 --> 10:58.465
To war!

11:11.543 --> 11:12.656
Are you wounded Theodore?

11:12.656 --> 11:15.571
this doesn't change anything

12:23.092 --> 12:27.562
BRIAN D!

12:27.562 --> 12:29.081
Yes Calhoun?

12:29.081 --> 12:30.429
I'm expelled?

12:30.429 --> 12:31.970
I gave you a chance to leave quietly

12:31.970 --> 12:34.144
and this is how you use it?

12:34.144 --> 12:35.460
assaulting a student?

12:35.460 --> 12:36.326
initiating a brawl?

12:36.326 --> 12:37.599
stealing a hat?

12:37.599 --> 12:39.209
and worst of all Brian

12:39.209 --> 12:41.248
worst of all

12:41.248 --> 12:43.676
you forgot that it's all about the game

12:43.676 --> 12:46.144
Sir, please you can't do this

12:46.144 --> 12:48.095
Yes I can

12:48.095 --> 12:49.490
It's done

12:49.490 --> 12:51.330
you're facing a 300 point abduction

12:51.330 --> 12:53.974
300 points you do not have

12:53.974 --> 12:55.413
you've got to be joking

12:55.413 --> 12:58.232
Do you hear any rotflcopters son?

12:58.232 --> 13:01.291
Pack your thing and get out of my school!

13:09.598 --> 13:12.353
Are you more like a rockstar everyday, kiddo

13:15.558 --> 13:16.509
What?

13:16.509 --> 13:18.204
Is this a joke?

13:19.142 --> 13:19.898
Am i a joke to you?

13:19.898 --> 13:20.921
No no no no

13:20.921 --> 13:22.047
There must be some mistake

13:22.047 --> 13:24.092
you know Ted you want to bail on the Wong, that's fine

13:24.092 --> 13:26.563
but getting some groupie to take your place?

13:26.563 --> 13:28.192
That's pathetic

13:28.192 --> 13:28.841
dad

13:28.841 --> 13:33.314
Dad your face, now get out of mine, forever!

13:41.111 --> 13:43.625
Welcome to the team, Theodore

13:43.625 --> 13:45.280
you switched the cards

13:45.280 --> 13:46.856
Er... reason one

13:46.856 --> 13:49.135
as I explained in my previous presentation

13:49.135 --> 13:52.669
I don't care about your stupid graphs Ki

13:52.669 --> 13:54.806
my dad hates me because of you

13:54.806 --> 13:56.135
that brings us to reason two

13:56.135 --> 13:59.750
Ted, your dad hates you

13:59.750 --> 14:05.029
and not because of me, i mean, from before

14:05.029 --> 14:08.557
We're through Ki

14:08.557 --> 14:11.280
Ehm... ok

14:11.696 --> 14:12.993
I know you're upset

14:12.993 --> 14:14.519
if we think about this objectively

14:14.519 --> 14:19.412
OBJECTIVELY you've ruined my life

14:19.412 --> 14:23.267
I never want to see you again

14:23.267 --> 14:25.223
but i was just looking out for you

14:25.223 --> 14:26.750
Look out for me?

14:26.750 --> 14:30.509
Look form over there!

14:30.509 --> 14:32.661
Get out of my face

14:32.661 --> 14:35.657
forever

14:41.474 --> 14:42.309
Did you really want me to...

14:42.309 --> 14:45.311
just go!

15:08.052 --> 15:09.898
Hi

15:09.898 --> 15:10.911
Jenny I'm sorry

15:10.911 --> 15:13.962
sorry for punching Law in front of the school

15:13.962 --> 15:17.726
or for ruining my chances of making Varsity this year

15:17.726 --> 15:22.681
yes, both of these things, and before you hit me again there's something i've got to take off of my chest

15:22.681 --> 15:24.211
What? That you like me?

15:24.211 --> 15:27.462
That you were just sticking up for me against my big mean boyfriend?

15:27.462 --> 15:29.779
Look i get that you're upset we can't be friends

15:29.779 --> 15:32.659
but you're not the only one who has a tough round here ok?

15:32.659 --> 15:37.232
If you can't suck it up then leave

15:44.918 --> 15:46.718
Hey!

15:46.718 --> 15:49.153
You'd be happy to know i just got expelled

15:49.153 --> 15:51.119
SO i am leaving

15:51.119 --> 15:53.013
oh and your big mean boyfriend

15:53.013 --> 15:54.843
he told me he's not going to put you in the team anyway

15:54.843 --> 15:58.673
so at least you've got a show out of it

15:59.504 --> 16:01.713
You're an asshole
