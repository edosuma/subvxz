WEBVTT

00:00.671 --> 00:02.079
Previously on...

00:02.103 --> 00:05.652
All this time, my father
has been right across town

00:05.676 --> 00:07.154
running the feed store?

00:07.178 --> 00:08.415
Susan found her real father...

00:08.439 --> 00:10.417
Ed wants to make
the final decision.

00:10.441 --> 00:12.419
Ed ferrara, Lynette Scavo.

00:12.443 --> 00:14.166
Lynette met her new boss...

00:14.190 --> 00:16.423
I've learned my lesson,
and when I get outta here,

00:16.447 --> 00:17.994
everything's gonna be different.

00:18.018 --> 00:21.128
Carlos promised to change
his old ways...

00:21.152 --> 00:23.700
Dr. Goldfine has concerns
about us being together,

00:23.724 --> 00:25.041
and I'm starting
to think he's right.

00:25.065 --> 00:27.504
While Bree discovered
George's true colors.

00:27.528 --> 00:29.276
George, I don't want to!

00:29.300 --> 00:31.478
We are engaged!
You have to wear it!

00:31.502 --> 00:34.212
I don't think we are anymore.

00:35.606 --> 00:38.085
Anyone who'd ever
been to a party

00:38.109 --> 00:40.347
at Bree Van De Kamp's
thought of her

00:40.371 --> 00:42.649
as the perfect hostess
because Bree knew

00:42.673 --> 00:45.292
how to take care of her guests.

00:45.316 --> 00:49.456
Her dinners were always
served promptly,

00:49.480 --> 00:53.700
her liquor always flowed freely

00:53.724 --> 00:58.565
and her anecdotes
were always enjoyable.

00:58.589 --> 01:01.738
But on this night,
the perfect hostess

01:01.762 --> 01:03.610
was about to find herself...

01:03.634 --> 01:04.611
Shh.

01:04.635 --> 01:07.114
Where's that music coming from?

01:09.100 --> 01:13.220
In a very imperfect predicament.

01:13.244 --> 01:15.154
Uh, I'm not sure.

01:38.569 --> 01:40.547
What do you think you're doing?

01:40.571 --> 01:42.249
We had a tiff. I upset you.

01:42.273 --> 01:44.260
And now I'm just trying
to make things right again.

01:44.284 --> 01:46.213

02:05.796 --> 02:07.774
Why don't you all
take your seats?

02:07.798 --> 02:10.157

Yes, Bree knew how
to take care of her guests,

02:41.792 --> 02:45.272
especially those
who weren't invited.

02:55.306 --> 02:57.324
Good guys wear white hats,

02:57.348 --> 02:59.286
and bad guys wear black.

02:59.310 --> 03:00.657
This is how children

03:00.681 --> 03:02.489
distinguish
between good and evil.

03:02.513 --> 03:05.232
Ohh!

03:05.256 --> 03:07.234
But they soon learn
that bad guys

03:07.258 --> 03:09.896
don't always look so bad.

03:09.920 --> 03:13.240
In fact, sometimes they even
seem downright friendly.

03:13.264 --> 03:16.848
That is, until you get to know
them a little bit better.

03:16.872 --> 03:18.345
Hey, fancy seeing you here.

03:18.369 --> 03:20.347
I was just out
for a little ride.

03:20.371 --> 03:21.848
Don't lie to me, George.

03:21.872 --> 03:24.180
You've been riding up and down
this street for the last hour.

03:24.204 --> 03:26.383
I don't want to do this, Bree,

03:26.407 --> 03:28.385
but you won't return
any of my phone calls.

03:28.409 --> 03:31.479
So stalking me is plan "b"?

03:32.583 --> 03:34.361
Bree, I know I messed up.

03:34.385 --> 03:36.393
I know I got some issues
to work on,

03:36.417 --> 03:38.395
but I'd be willing to see
a therapist

03:38.419 --> 03:39.896
if that's what you want.

03:39.920 --> 03:42.899
I'll do anything, but how
can I show you that I can...

03:42.923 --> 03:45.410
I can change if you don't
give me a second chance?

03:45.434 --> 03:46.733
Come on.

03:46.757 --> 03:48.575
You know I'm not a bad person.

03:48.599 --> 03:50.277
I do know that,

03:50.301 --> 03:53.240
but I'm just not sure
you're a good one, either.

04:00.341 --> 04:02.449
And we integrated
the corporate logo

04:02.473 --> 04:03.950
into the jungle background,

04:03.974 --> 04:06.231
creating not only an ad
for the clothing,

04:06.255 --> 04:09.476
but for the company itself.

04:13.324 --> 04:14.701
I don't get it.

04:14.725 --> 04:17.764
What, um, don't you get?

04:17.788 --> 04:21.408
The whole idea just kinda
makes my head hurt.

04:21.432 --> 04:22.709
Is it just me?

04:22.733 --> 04:24.816
No, nuh-unh.
You're right. It stinks.

04:24.840 --> 04:27.013
Sorry, guys.
Back to the drawing board.

04:27.037 --> 04:29.516
Well, I got tickets to a game.

04:29.540 --> 04:31.778
Nina, you do whatever
you have to do

04:31.802 --> 04:33.350
to keep us afloat here.

04:33.374 --> 04:34.821
You got it.

04:34.845 --> 04:37.824
Looks like it's gonna be another
late night at the office.

04:37.848 --> 04:39.386
Nice work, everybody. Thank you.

04:39.410 --> 04:41.828
Could you can
the attitude, Nina?

04:41.852 --> 04:44.361
I'm sorry.
What did you just say?

04:44.385 --> 04:46.693
You're being rude.
And it's totally out of line.

04:46.717 --> 04:48.565
You know how hard
we all worked on this.

04:48.589 --> 04:50.497
Yeah, I do.

04:50.521 --> 04:52.499
Nina, I think I speak
for everyone here

04:52.523 --> 04:56.473
when I say we are sick
and tired of your abuse.

04:56.497 --> 04:59.346
Frankly, you owe us an apology.

04:59.370 --> 05:00.907
Is... is this true?

05:00.931 --> 05:03.350
I mean, I would be mortified

05:03.374 --> 05:05.514
if I thought that I'd hurt
any of you.

05:06.777 --> 05:09.516
If anybody feels like
I owe them an apology,

05:09.540 --> 05:15.291
please, speak up.

05:15.315 --> 05:16.993
You? You?

05:17.017 --> 05:18.795
You?

05:18.819 --> 05:20.367
Gee, Lynette.

05:20.391 --> 05:21.828
I guess you were mistaken.

05:21.852 --> 05:24.571
All right,
let's recap, shall we?

05:24.595 --> 05:28.455
Stinky pitch, workin' late,
no apologies.

05:31.362 --> 05:34.310
Guys! We talked about this.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.921
What happened to standing up
for ourselves?

05:36.945 --> 05:38.985
Hot muffins. Any takers?

05:39.009 --> 05:41.739
No, stu. These people
don't deserve muffins.

05:47.848 --> 05:49.325
Hello?

05:49.349 --> 05:51.327
Hello.
My name is Mark Martinez.

05:51.351 --> 05:53.830
I'm the assistant warden
down at fairvew county jail.

05:53.854 --> 05:55.341
Is Mrs. Solis available?

05:55.365 --> 05:57.464
Uh, yeah, this is her.

05:57.488 --> 05:59.366
Did somethin' happen
with Carlos?

05:59.390 --> 06:01.438
At 7:43 this morning,
your husband held

06:01.462 --> 06:04.379
two guards at gunpoint
and successfully escaped.

06:04.403 --> 06:05.672
He what?!

06:05.696 --> 06:07.674
I take it you had
no prior knowledge

06:07.698 --> 06:09.676
he had planned to do this?

06:09.700 --> 06:12.379
No, of course not. He's a moron!

06:12.403 --> 06:14.386
We have every reason to believe

06:14.410 --> 06:16.383
your husband may come
to find you.

06:16.407 --> 06:18.385
We believe him to be armed...

06:18.409 --> 06:21.027
And very, very horny.

06:21.051 --> 06:22.689
What?

06:22.713 --> 06:25.432
Surprise, baby.

06:25.456 --> 06:27.434
I got paroled early.

06:27.458 --> 06:29.896
It's so good to see you!

06:29.920 --> 06:30.897
Mmm.

06:30.921 --> 06:32.399
What happened?

06:32.423 --> 06:33.900
Well, there's this church group

06:33.924 --> 06:35.907
that helps out catholic
prisoners. Mm-hmm.

06:35.931 --> 06:38.144
And they really,
really stepped up for me.

06:38.168 --> 06:39.646
Well, what did they do?

06:39.670 --> 06:41.778
They lobbied the parole board
and it worked.

06:41.802 --> 06:44.981
I guess I owe the pope
a thank-you note.

06:45.005 --> 06:48.585
Mnh-mnh. Less talking,
more stripping.

06:48.609 --> 06:49.916
Ahh!

06:57.417 --> 06:58.925
Prudy's feed store.

06:58.949 --> 07:01.498
Apparently, he owns the place.

07:01.522 --> 07:03.800
How are you gonna do it?
What do you mean?

07:03.824 --> 07:06.881
I mean, how are you gonna
tell him you're his daughter?

07:06.905 --> 07:09.035
Oh, I'm not.

07:09.059 --> 07:11.538
Julie, the man abandoned me
before I was born.

07:11.562 --> 07:14.410
I don't have a desire to have
a relationship with him.

07:14.434 --> 07:18.515
Okay, then I'm really confused
why we're here spying on him.

07:18.539 --> 07:21.417
Well, I just wanna see
what he's like

07:21.441 --> 07:25.721
and satisfy my curiosity
and get it out of my system.

07:33.123 --> 07:35.532
Well, here you go.

07:35.556 --> 07:37.534
Now you tell Charlie
that Addison prudy says

07:37.558 --> 07:39.035
drop in some time.

07:39.059 --> 07:41.067
I miss that ugly mug of his
around here.

07:41.091 --> 07:42.231
I will.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.616
I bet I know
what you're here for.

07:49.640 --> 07:51.478
Oh?

07:51.502 --> 07:53.480
You heard about the giveaway.

07:53.504 --> 07:55.227
Well, I got the cowboy hats
right here.

07:55.251 --> 07:56.723
Oh, oh, no, that's okay.

07:56.747 --> 07:58.755
You don't have to
give me anything, really.

07:58.779 --> 08:00.757
Relax.
This is a promotional item.

08:00.781 --> 08:02.581
Didn't cost me a dime.

08:08.659 --> 08:10.637
There you go.

08:10.661 --> 08:12.621
Pretty as a picture.

08:22.172 --> 08:24.651
I have a dad. He's great!

08:24.675 --> 08:26.683
He gave me a hat.

08:29.239 --> 08:32.659
Wow.

08:32.683 --> 08:34.760
That biting thing at the end...

08:34.784 --> 08:35.761
Mm?

08:35.785 --> 08:37.994
Totally blew my mind.

08:38.018 --> 08:40.496
Please tell me you didn't
learn that in prison.

08:40.520 --> 08:43.499
Yeah.

08:43.523 --> 08:47.503
Wait. I'm not done with you yet.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.736
Just give me ten minutes,
please.

08:49.760 --> 08:51.738
What is wrong with you?

08:51.762 --> 08:54.510
You are totally useless
after sex.

08:54.534 --> 08:57.544
I know. I should probably
get my thyroid checked out.

09:06.877 --> 09:09.626
Who's sister Mary Bernard?

09:09.650 --> 09:12.759
Hey, those are private.
Give me...

09:12.783 --> 09:14.300
She's this nun, okay?

09:14.324 --> 09:16.733
She visited me in prison
a couple times.

09:16.757 --> 09:18.605
She's part of the group
that got me early release.

09:18.629 --> 09:20.607
Now can I please have them back?

09:20.631 --> 09:22.769
"When you walk with god
every day,

09:22.793 --> 09:25.320
"you learn that truth
is understood in the mind

09:25.344 --> 09:27.574
but faith burns in the heart"?

09:27.598 --> 09:30.677
You don't know
what it was like in there.

09:30.701 --> 09:34.721
All right? 20 hours a day,
8x10 cell.

09:34.745 --> 09:36.745
Just you and your mind.

09:37.948 --> 09:39.908
So pretty much just you.

09:42.282 --> 09:44.991
It forces you
to rexamine everything.

09:45.015 --> 09:47.694
I was a very bad person
for a very long time,

09:47.718 --> 09:49.565
but now all that is gonna change

09:49.589 --> 09:51.759
because I'm on a new path.

09:53.694 --> 09:54.971
A new path?

09:54.995 --> 09:57.143
I am going to live
a virtuous life.

09:57.167 --> 09:59.806
I wanna do right by you,

09:59.830 --> 10:01.748
by my mamá

10:01.772 --> 10:03.732
and by my god.

10:07.037 --> 10:10.337
What the hell did they do
to you in that prison?

10:18.989 --> 10:21.968
All right, this is my last hand,
and then I gotta go. Already?

10:21.992 --> 10:24.130
I left a proposal
on my desk at work.

10:24.154 --> 10:25.702
I have to go over it tonight,

10:25.726 --> 10:27.734
or you-know-who is gonna have
my head. Nina.

10:27.758 --> 10:30.006
You know,
this gainful employment thing

10:30.030 --> 10:32.679
is really starting
to cut into our social life.

10:32.703 --> 10:35.150
Well, if one of you would just
agree to raise my kids,

10:35.174 --> 10:37.984
I wouldn't need a job.
Any takers?

10:38.008 --> 10:40.086
Ha ha. No, I didn't think so.

10:40.110 --> 10:42.148
Ante up.

10:42.172 --> 10:44.620
Speaking of child abandonment,

10:44.644 --> 10:46.197
when are you gonna tell
your father

10:46.221 --> 10:48.655
that he has a bouncing,
middle-aged baby girl?

10:48.679 --> 10:52.328
Soon. I don't wanna ambush him.
I'm gonna ease into it.

10:52.352 --> 10:55.866
How do you ease into, "hi.
I'm your illegitimate daughter"?

10:55.890 --> 10:57.764
Well, actually,
there's a "help wanted" sign

10:57.788 --> 11:00.767
in the window, so I was thinking
about getting a job there.

11:00.791 --> 11:03.269
And you know,
he would get to know me,

11:03.293 --> 11:06.280
and I'm sure he would like me
and I would like him,

11:06.304 --> 11:08.274
and then one day, he'd say,

11:08.298 --> 11:10.176
"you're like the daughter
I never had,"

11:10.200 --> 11:13.770
and I'd say, "well, actually,
now that you mention it..."

11:15.746 --> 11:18.184
Okay, I'll go first.

11:18.208 --> 11:20.787
That is the most idiotic plan
I've ever heard of.

11:20.811 --> 11:22.789
Why?

11:22.813 --> 11:25.700
Because it all hinges on him
responding to your personality.

11:25.724 --> 11:28.865
And let's face it,
you are an acquired taste.

11:28.889 --> 11:31.868
Edie, I am sure Susan's father
will like her just fine.

11:31.892 --> 11:33.269
Thank you.

11:33.293 --> 11:36.277
I just hope you don't expect
too much from this relationship.

11:36.301 --> 11:38.204
I mean, aside from d.N.A.,
you might find

11:38.228 --> 11:40.206
that you don't have
that much in common.

11:40.230 --> 11:43.209
I know, but I gotta find out
if there's something there.

11:43.233 --> 11:45.211
I've always wanted a dad.

11:45.235 --> 11:47.313
I mean, I know not having one
affected me.

11:47.337 --> 11:48.855
Well, of course it did.

11:48.879 --> 11:51.687
Everyone needs
a strong male role model.

11:51.711 --> 11:53.189
No, they don't.

11:53.213 --> 11:56.697
I grew up without a father,
and it didn't affect me one bit.

11:56.721 --> 11:59.316
Edie, how old were you
when you lost your virginity?

12:01.351 --> 12:02.991
Point well taken.

12:18.238 --> 12:19.385
Hey.

12:19.409 --> 12:22.209
Look what I found
in Ed's fridge.

12:47.337 --> 12:51.347
Hey, st...

12:51.371 --> 12:54.750
And Nina!

12:54.774 --> 12:57.784
Hey, Lynette,
can I see you for a sec?

12:57.808 --> 12:59.548
Sure.

13:01.451 --> 13:02.929
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

13:02.953 --> 13:04.940
Having sex
with the support staff...

13:04.964 --> 13:06.432
That's a big no-no.

13:06.456 --> 13:09.896
Ed's been known to fire people
for that sort of thing.

13:09.920 --> 13:11.167
Lynette,

13:11.191 --> 13:14.801
I know that we've had
our little differences.

13:14.825 --> 13:17.203
But at the core,

13:17.227 --> 13:20.776
I believe that we're both
good people,

13:20.800 --> 13:24.550
both smart women who are
just trying to make it

13:24.574 --> 13:27.383
in this vicious
male-dominated jungle...

13:27.407 --> 13:29.455
Okay, what do you want?

13:29.479 --> 13:32.788
Do you want a raise?
You want a better office?

13:32.812 --> 13:34.891
My demands are simple.

13:34.915 --> 13:38.364
I want you to be nicer.

13:38.388 --> 13:39.896
What?

13:39.920 --> 13:41.397
No more belittling,

13:41.421 --> 13:42.829
berating,

13:42.853 --> 13:44.831
rude sarcasm.

13:44.855 --> 13:46.903
And in exchange
I get your silence?

13:46.927 --> 13:49.305
Yeah. Pretty sweet deal,
don't you think?

13:49.329 --> 13:52.208
Um...

13:52.232 --> 13:54.240
I'll see what I can do.

13:54.264 --> 13:57.043
Great. Okay.

13:57.067 --> 13:59.215
And I'm gonna take
your parking space.

13:59.239 --> 14:00.847
Hmm?

14:00.871 --> 14:02.871
I kid the Nina.

14:11.851 --> 14:13.329
You're up early.

14:13.353 --> 14:14.830
I'm going to mass.

14:14.854 --> 14:15.831
Huh?

14:15.855 --> 14:16.832
Yeah.

14:16.856 --> 14:19.165
But it's not even sunday.

14:19.189 --> 14:21.337
They have mass
every day of the week.

14:21.361 --> 14:24.310
Really? When did
they start doing that?

14:25.495 --> 14:26.973
That's sister Mary Bernard.

14:26.997 --> 14:28.997
Did you see
where I put my Bible?

14:53.193 --> 14:55.001
What?

14:55.025 --> 14:56.402
I saw your nun.

14:56.426 --> 14:57.443
So?

14:57.467 --> 15:00.046
So she's hot. She's a hot nun.

15:00.070 --> 15:04.310
You can't
seriously be jealous.

15:04.334 --> 15:07.318
You mean to tell me that this
miraculous conversion of yours

15:07.342 --> 15:09.315
has nothing to do with the fact

15:09.339 --> 15:12.209
that the woman standing
outside is a knockout?

15:14.314 --> 15:16.324
That's what I'm telling you.

15:42.942 --> 15:45.921
Um, who are you here to see?

15:45.945 --> 15:49.495
I'm Lynette Scavo. I work here.

15:49.519 --> 15:50.997
Who are you?

15:51.021 --> 15:53.059
Pat. It's my first day.

15:53.083 --> 15:55.361
Oh. Well, welcome.

15:55.385 --> 15:57.033
What happened to stu?

15:57.057 --> 15:58.965
You fired stu?

15:58.989 --> 16:02.068
Oh, Lynette, hey. Come on in.

16:02.092 --> 16:05.071
I can't believe
you would sink so low.

16:05.095 --> 16:06.572
I'm going to ed.

16:06.596 --> 16:12.018
Ed knows. This is stu's employee
evaluation file right here.

16:12.042 --> 16:14.720
This thing is full
of black marks.

16:14.744 --> 16:18.061
Come on, Nina. We both know
why you got rid of him.

16:18.085 --> 16:21.027
Well, good luck proving it.

16:21.051 --> 16:22.728
Oh, and on a completely
unrelated topic,

16:22.752 --> 16:25.099
there's going to be
another round of firings

16:25.123 --> 16:27.163
coming down the pike.

16:27.187 --> 16:29.335
Ed's been after me
to trim the fat.

16:29.359 --> 16:32.468
You threatening me?
No, no. Unh-unh.

16:32.492 --> 16:34.470
It's just that
it's gonna be my job

16:34.494 --> 16:36.481
to evaluate
those who are team players

16:36.505 --> 16:38.104
and those who are not.

16:38.128 --> 16:40.506
Just a little heads up.

16:40.530 --> 16:43.300
Just trying to be nice.

16:46.676 --> 16:50.686
I don't know. You seem
kinda overqualified.

16:50.710 --> 16:52.618
Why, 'cause I went to college?

16:52.642 --> 16:54.520
No, because you finished
high school.

16:57.347 --> 16:58.994
Well, I just wanna change
my life,

16:59.018 --> 17:01.027
and ever since I was
a little girl,

17:01.051 --> 17:04.099
I've always liked horses
and the outdoors,

17:04.124 --> 17:08.273
and, well, I'm just fascinated
with... feed.

17:08.298 --> 17:12.058
Well, I suppose we could
give you a try.

17:14.564 --> 17:16.242
What?

17:16.266 --> 17:18.243
Something on my nose?

17:18.268 --> 17:23.118
Oh, no. Um, I was just looking
at the color of your eyes.

17:23.143 --> 17:25.550
You were?

17:25.575 --> 17:28.294
Yeah. They're just like mine.

17:28.318 --> 17:30.596
They're... they're nice.

17:30.620 --> 17:34.060
Carol sent you to test me,
didn't she?

17:34.084 --> 17:36.062
What? Who's Carol?

17:36.086 --> 17:37.363
You go back and tell my wife

17:37.387 --> 17:39.205
if a private detective
couldn't fool me,

17:39.229 --> 17:41.137
well, you're not gonna either.

17:41.161 --> 17:42.768
I don't know what
you're talking about.

17:42.792 --> 17:44.770
I just came in to get a little...
A cute little thing like you

17:44.794 --> 17:48.151
struts in here, flirts with
an old codger like me...

17:48.175 --> 17:50.076
How dumb do you think I am?

17:50.100 --> 17:53.079
Hey, look at you. Pretty hair.
You got a sexy walk.

17:53.103 --> 17:54.550
You got a tight little ass...

17:54.574 --> 17:56.084
Oh, I'm your daughter.

17:57.747 --> 17:59.085
What?

17:59.109 --> 18:02.057
Back in the '60s,

18:02.081 --> 18:05.561
you had a brief... Relationship

18:05.585 --> 18:08.063
with a young girl,
Sophia bremmer.

18:08.087 --> 18:11.237
She got pregnant and had a baby,

18:11.261 --> 18:13.239
and that baby was me,

18:13.263 --> 18:15.433
which makes you my father.

18:17.497 --> 18:19.197
Hi.

18:22.332 --> 18:23.809
Mr. Prudy, I'm sorry.

18:23.833 --> 18:26.490
I didn't want to spring it
on you like this.

18:26.514 --> 18:28.184
Where are you going?

18:28.208 --> 18:30.186
You see, when I found out
you were alive

18:30.210 --> 18:32.188
and that we both lived
in the same city,

18:32.212 --> 18:33.819
I just wanted to meet you.

18:33.843 --> 18:34.820
Mr. Prudy?

18:36.346 --> 18:38.324
Mr. Prudy.

18:38.348 --> 18:41.118
Hello?

18:42.452 --> 18:44.692
Hello?

18:57.867 --> 19:01.287
And knock wood, the doctors say
I'll keep improving

19:01.311 --> 19:04.190
slowly but surely.

19:04.214 --> 19:06.552
So how are you?

19:06.576 --> 19:08.824
Good, good. I'm seeing friends,

19:08.848 --> 19:10.826
and I just started co-chairing

19:10.850 --> 19:12.828
a charity event
for the junior league,

19:12.852 --> 19:18.204
and, um, and I broke up
with George.

19:18.228 --> 19:19.305
Really?

19:19.329 --> 19:21.807
Dr. Goldfine, do you ever
really cure people,

19:21.831 --> 19:26.172
I mean, even if
they're really crazy?

19:26.196 --> 19:28.274
I'm not a big fan of that word.

19:28.298 --> 19:31.447
People either have
mental health or they don't.

19:31.471 --> 19:33.219
When they do have a problem,

19:33.243 --> 19:36.227
you treat them as if
they had any other disease,

19:36.251 --> 19:38.224
and sometimes they get better.

19:38.248 --> 19:40.226
Well, when I broke up
with George,

19:40.250 --> 19:42.788
I saw something in his eyes.

19:42.812 --> 19:45.561
It was a kind of malevolence,

19:45.585 --> 19:47.233
and it just didn't seem to me

19:47.257 --> 19:49.235
to be the sort of thing
that you could cure.

19:49.259 --> 19:52.167
I don't believe in evil either.
We're all just people.

19:52.191 --> 19:54.169
How can you not believe in evil?

19:54.193 --> 19:57.377
A man just threw you
off a bridge for no reason.

19:57.401 --> 19:59.375
Exactly. He didn't know
anything about me.

19:59.399 --> 20:02.278
He just rode up
on his little blue bike

20:02.302 --> 20:04.280
and tried to hurt me.

20:04.304 --> 20:08.314
Do I think he's wicked?
No. He's disturbed.

20:08.338 --> 20:11.917
His problems probably stem
from a chemical imbalance.

20:11.941 --> 20:14.981
I believe with enough time
and treatment, I could help him.

20:17.287 --> 20:20.517
Did you say a blue bike?

20:28.558 --> 20:29.575
Black?

20:29.599 --> 20:30.606
Mmm.

20:30.630 --> 20:31.837
Great.

20:31.861 --> 20:33.339
I gotta say, Lynette,

20:33.363 --> 20:35.346
I was surprised
to get your call.

20:35.370 --> 20:37.543
I didn't even think
you'd notice I was fired.

20:37.567 --> 20:41.216
Of course I noticed.
You are one of my favorites.

20:41.240 --> 20:44.750
And I thought it was really
unfair how it all went down.

20:44.774 --> 20:47.931
It wasn't that unfair.
Iwaslate all those times,

20:47.955 --> 20:49.595
and I broke the copier.

20:49.619 --> 20:51.357
And I stole
all those paper clips.

20:51.381 --> 20:55.401
See, I don't think
that's why you got fired.

20:55.425 --> 20:58.804
Really? That's what Nina said.

20:58.828 --> 21:02.838
Word got out that
you and Nina were...

21:02.862 --> 21:03.939
Shagging?

21:03.963 --> 21:06.772
Being intimate.

21:06.796 --> 21:10.676
And Nina fired you
to keep ed from finding out.

21:10.700 --> 21:12.247
You're kidding.

21:12.271 --> 21:13.849
And that wasn't right of her.

21:13.873 --> 21:15.490
She shouldn't have been
having sex with you.

21:15.514 --> 21:17.323
She's upper management.

21:17.347 --> 21:20.556
Technically,
it's sexual harassment.

21:20.580 --> 21:23.258
But I was into it. I consented.

21:23.282 --> 21:26.932
Stu, you're a... gofer.

21:26.956 --> 21:28.916
You can't consent to anything.

21:30.820 --> 21:34.800
So I think you should talk to ed
about getting your job back.

21:34.824 --> 21:36.572
Why would he care?

21:36.596 --> 21:38.273
Oh, he'll care.

21:38.297 --> 21:41.807
He doesn't want you suing him
for millions of dollars.

21:41.831 --> 21:43.278
Wow!

21:43.302 --> 21:45.711
Uh-huh.

21:45.735 --> 21:47.713
So would Nina get in trouble?

21:47.737 --> 21:49.715
Well, I'm not gonna lie to you.

21:49.739 --> 21:53.819
There is a possibility
she'd get a...

21:53.843 --> 21:56.492
Slap on the wrist.

21:56.516 --> 21:58.324
So...

21:58.348 --> 22:00.426
You'll think about
talking to ed?

22:00.450 --> 22:01.690
Definitely.

22:06.796 --> 22:08.934
The nurse told me
you were waiting out there.

22:08.958 --> 22:11.437
I just wanted to see
if you were okay.

22:11.461 --> 22:14.780
Sorry if I spooked you.
I've got a bad heart.

22:14.804 --> 22:18.644
It's genetic, so you might
wanna get that checked.

22:18.668 --> 22:22.348
Oh. Okay.

22:22.372 --> 22:25.999
Look, don't take this wrong,
but I need you to clear out.

22:26.023 --> 22:28.323
What? I just got here.

22:28.347 --> 22:31.857
My wife is on her way.
The thing is, if Carol finds out

22:31.881 --> 22:34.560
I'e got an adult love child
running around,

22:34.584 --> 22:37.341
that's gonna be the straw
that breaks the camel's back.

22:37.365 --> 22:42.808
I mean, it's not exactly
the only time I've strayed.

22:42.832 --> 22:44.710
Charming.

22:44.734 --> 22:48.348
But believe me, it was nice
to finally get to meet you.

22:48.372 --> 22:49.667
You're a lovely woman.

22:51.841 --> 22:56.081
Hon, you really need
to leave now.

23:00.580 --> 23:01.787
It's Susan.

23:01.811 --> 23:04.460
My name is Susan.

23:04.484 --> 23:08.063
And, no, that's not good enough.

23:08.087 --> 23:09.795
Look, I'm...

23:09.819 --> 23:12.498
I'm trying really hard
to be nice about this,

23:12.522 --> 23:14.540
but you're backing me
into a corner.

23:14.564 --> 23:16.851
It's not like I want
an invitation to Thanksgiving.

23:16.875 --> 23:20.776
I just wanna have coffee
or lunch now and then.

23:20.800 --> 23:23.078
I can't start up
something with you.

23:23.102 --> 23:25.080
It wouldn't be fair to my wife.

23:25.104 --> 23:26.582
Oh, that's funny.

23:26.606 --> 23:28.884
So all the times
you were cheating on her,

23:28.908 --> 23:31.386
that was okay, but having lunch
with your daughter...

23:31.410 --> 23:33.519
That just crosses the line.

23:33.543 --> 23:36.100
I just want a chance
to get to know you.

23:36.124 --> 23:39.585
Well, I don't want to know you.

23:42.091 --> 23:43.921
I've already got a family.

23:45.495 --> 23:48.474
Years ago, your mother and I
came to an understanding.

23:48.498 --> 23:50.476
I gave her a bunch of money,

23:50.500 --> 23:53.100
and she agreed
to keep things quiet.

23:54.934 --> 23:58.844
Well, I wasn't consulted
on that little arrangement.

23:58.868 --> 24:00.986
I don't think it's fair
to punish me

24:01.010 --> 24:02.988
for a mistake I made years ago.

24:03.012 --> 24:05.559
Is that what you think of me?
I'm a mistake?

24:05.583 --> 24:09.525
That's what you need to hear,
yeah.

24:09.549 --> 24:10.849
That's what I think.

24:14.554 --> 24:17.533
Oh, addy!

24:17.557 --> 24:20.566
Addy! Oh!

24:20.590 --> 24:22.538
Oh, are you okay?

24:22.562 --> 24:24.169
I'm good, baby.

24:24.193 --> 24:27.072
The kids are on their way over.

24:27.096 --> 24:31.446
Hi. I'm... Carol.

24:31.470 --> 24:32.640
You are...

24:35.545 --> 24:37.845
Do you wanna tell her,
or should I?

24:44.514 --> 24:47.024
I'm your husband's
guardian angel.

24:48.487 --> 24:49.935
Excuse me?

24:49.959 --> 24:51.637
My name's Susan.

24:51.661 --> 24:54.199
I was buying some horse feed

24:54.223 --> 24:57.180
when Mr. Prudy had an attack
behind the counter.

24:57.204 --> 25:00.145
I gave him c.P.R., called 9-1-1.

25:00.169 --> 25:04.149
Oh! Thank you.

25:04.173 --> 25:05.881
Thank you.

25:05.905 --> 25:09.735
Oh. When I think what...
What could have happened...

25:11.641 --> 25:13.619
Well, I'm gonna get out of here.

25:13.643 --> 25:15.630
Mr. Prudy,
I want you to hurry up

25:15.654 --> 25:18.624
and get back on your feet.

25:18.648 --> 25:20.495
I'm not giving up.

25:20.519 --> 25:23.028
I'm gonna be
back in the store next week.

25:23.052 --> 25:27.072
I never got
that darn horse feed.

25:27.096 --> 25:29.575
I guess I'll put
a bag aside for you.

25:29.599 --> 25:31.529
You do that.

25:55.054 --> 25:56.562
Bree, it's me.

25:56.586 --> 25:58.934
The police are at my house.
They're going through my stuff.

25:58.958 --> 26:00.265
What the hell is going on?

26:00.289 --> 26:02.838
Look, I know you're there.
Pick up!

26:02.862 --> 26:05.540
Did you have anything
to do with this?

26:05.564 --> 26:09.174
Bree? Bree!

26:09.198 --> 26:13.148
George, I know what you did
to Dr. Goldfine,

26:13.172 --> 26:16.682
and I can see now
just how sick you really are,

26:16.706 --> 26:18.684
so please just turn yourself in,

26:18.708 --> 26:21.987
and that way you can get
the help you really need.

26:22.011 --> 26:24.681
George?

26:50.740 --> 26:52.017
What's going on?

26:52.041 --> 26:53.959
Oh, I invited
sister Mary hotpants

26:53.983 --> 26:55.590
over for lunch.

26:55.614 --> 26:56.662
What?

26:56.686 --> 26:58.093
You said she touched your soul,

26:58.117 --> 27:00.595
so I just want to make sure
her hands are clean.

27:02.992 --> 27:05.731
So, sister Mary, tell me,

27:05.755 --> 27:07.733
what's it like
meeting men in prison?

27:07.757 --> 27:10.976
Do you bond with all convicts,
or was Carlos just special?

27:11.000 --> 27:13.208
Well, of course,
Carlos is special,

27:13.232 --> 27:15.686
but our mission does
a ton of Evangelical work

27:15.710 --> 27:16.982
with several prisons.

27:17.006 --> 27:18.684
Oh, I get it.

27:18.708 --> 27:21.386
Sort of like, today's convict
is tomorrow's convert.

27:21.410 --> 27:24.790
Something like that,
but mostly I do charity work.

27:24.814 --> 27:26.901
Are you two involved
in any charities?

27:26.925 --> 27:29.895
Currently? No.

27:29.919 --> 27:32.798
But we should be.
I mean, let's face it, Gaby.

27:32.822 --> 27:35.909
Buying more stuff isn't gonna
make our lives any better.

27:35.933 --> 27:37.332
Exactly.

27:37.356 --> 27:39.735
Money can't buy happiness.

27:39.759 --> 27:42.337
Well, sure it can.
That's just a lie

27:42.361 --> 27:44.109
we tell poor people to
keep 'em from rioting. Gaby!

27:44.133 --> 27:46.772
It's a joke. Lighten up.

27:46.796 --> 27:48.143
Can you believe this?

27:48.167 --> 27:49.644
I'm married to a woman
so selfish,

27:49.668 --> 27:51.777
she makes fun of the entire
concept of charity.

27:51.801 --> 27:53.248
You are a hypocrite.

27:53.272 --> 27:55.250
The money you spent
to buy your sports car

27:55.274 --> 27:57.657
could buy a mud hut
for every peasant in Ecuador.

27:57.681 --> 27:58.824
Okay, you're right.

27:58.848 --> 28:01.326
But I'm evolving,
starting right now.

28:01.350 --> 28:05.090
Sister, I would like to donate
my car to your mission.

28:05.114 --> 28:06.992
What?

28:07.016 --> 28:09.434
Carlos, are you sure?
Absolutely.

28:09.458 --> 28:12.167
Gabrielle and I don't need
two cars. We can share one.

28:12.191 --> 28:15.775
Share? What if you have the car,
and I need to go shopping?

28:15.799 --> 28:17.803
We're gonna cut back
on shopping, too.

28:17.827 --> 28:20.345
Okay, I think we should all
just calm down a little bit.

28:20.369 --> 28:22.878
I'm gonna get you that pink slip
right now.

28:22.902 --> 28:24.872
Carlos... We're doing this.

28:27.406 --> 28:30.185
I have to... ahem.
Uh, here have some of this.

28:30.209 --> 28:32.279
No one needs to know.

28:37.216 --> 28:40.195
Don't even bother. You're not
talking me out of this.

28:40.219 --> 28:42.697
I'm not here to talk you
out of anything.

28:42.721 --> 28:44.221
Check in this drawer.

28:47.296 --> 28:50.475
Carlos, I wanna apologize
for the way I've been acting.

28:50.499 --> 28:53.478
I mean, here you are
trying to turn your life around,

28:53.502 --> 28:57.883
and all I can think about
are my stupid jealousy issues.

28:57.907 --> 29:00.385
Yeah, well, let's just
get back down there.

29:00.409 --> 29:02.748
No, I mean it. I'm sorry.

29:02.772 --> 29:05.851
I wanna be a better person, too.

29:05.875 --> 29:08.854
I'm sick of being bad.

29:08.878 --> 29:10.125
Forgive me?

29:10.149 --> 29:13.228
You're not a bad person.

29:13.252 --> 29:15.222
Really? Mmm!

29:16.425 --> 29:19.304
No, of course not.

29:19.328 --> 29:21.736
That's so sweet.

29:21.760 --> 29:25.841
I feel so close to you
right now.

29:25.865 --> 29:27.773
Gaby.

29:27.797 --> 29:31.397
I'm sorry. Guess iambad.

29:32.972 --> 29:36.321
Look, we got a nun downstairs.

29:36.345 --> 29:40.945
She can wait five minutes.
We're giving her a car.

29:43.953 --> 29:45.213
Ohh!

29:55.925 --> 29:57.903
Hey, pat, what's going on?

29:57.927 --> 29:59.404
I'm not sure.

29:59.428 --> 30:01.406
Ed keeps calling people
into his office.

30:01.430 --> 30:04.279
I think people
are getting fired.

30:04.303 --> 30:06.781
Lynette.

30:06.805 --> 30:07.905
Yeah.

30:15.915 --> 30:17.893
Lynette...

30:17.917 --> 30:19.264
Nina's out. You're in.

30:19.288 --> 30:21.796
You are
our new v.P. Of accounts.

30:21.820 --> 30:24.029
I... am?

30:24.053 --> 30:26.201
I just gave her the ax,

30:26.225 --> 30:28.904
along with a bunch of other
people. Why? What happened?

30:28.928 --> 30:31.136
Our old pal stu just filed
a sexual harassment suit

30:31.160 --> 30:33.138
against the company.

30:33.162 --> 30:34.840
He did what?

30:34.864 --> 30:37.317
He fired a fancy lawyer who
threatened to go to the press.

30:37.341 --> 30:39.314
I had no choice
but to pay him off.

30:39.338 --> 30:41.938
He had a video of him
and Nina together.

30:43.512 --> 30:46.922
Okay. I... get Nina,

30:46.946 --> 30:49.925
but why are you firing
everybody else?

30:49.949 --> 30:51.927
Stu's taking us to the cleaners.

30:51.951 --> 30:53.929
If I don't cut back on staff,

30:53.953 --> 30:55.910
the next round
of paychecks are gonna bounce.

30:55.934 --> 31:00.135
Oh, god, ed. I am so sorry.

31:00.159 --> 31:03.038
Well, it's not your fault.
We'll get through this.

31:03.062 --> 31:06.342
You and me together.

31:07.897 --> 31:09.875
Oh, can you run down
to the art department?

31:09.899 --> 31:11.877
Someone's gotta can
Jeff and Elizabeth.

31:11.901 --> 31:18.023
Yeah. Sure. I'm gonna go
and take care of that.

31:18.047 --> 31:21.086
Hey. Congratulations.

31:21.110 --> 31:23.088
This... Is not what I wanted.

31:23.112 --> 31:27.492
I just wanted you to be nicer.

31:27.516 --> 31:30.896
You know what?
I used to be nice.

31:30.920 --> 31:36.571
But our boss...
I'm sorry.Yourboss...

31:36.595 --> 31:40.005
Is incompetent and selfish

31:40.029 --> 31:42.507
and has the attention span
of a poodle.

31:42.531 --> 31:46.218
I mean, from day one, I have
been the only one around here

31:46.242 --> 31:48.914
keeping this place
from crumbling down

31:48.938 --> 31:50.415
around his stupid ears.

31:50.439 --> 31:51.987
Oh, Nina, come on.

31:52.011 --> 31:53.989
This is the truth here.

31:54.013 --> 31:56.000
Nice is a luxury that I gave up

31:56.024 --> 32:01.927
along with vacations
and relationships

32:01.951 --> 32:03.929
and eating at home.

32:03.953 --> 32:07.973
This job sucks you dry.

32:07.997 --> 32:10.976
So you better kiss those four
little kiddies of yours good-bye

32:11.000 --> 32:12.978
because you have just adopted

32:13.002 --> 32:16.112
the neediest little child
in the world.

32:17.566 --> 32:18.643
Here.

32:18.667 --> 32:21.167
You're gonna need this
more than I do.

32:33.452 --> 32:34.459
Hi.

32:34.483 --> 32:37.040
Carlos will be down
in a little while.

32:37.064 --> 32:40.265
We had an intense talk.

32:40.289 --> 32:42.007
He's resting.

32:42.031 --> 32:46.311
Yeah, I overheard
some of your... talk.

32:46.335 --> 32:50.215
Sorry. He's such an animal.

32:50.239 --> 32:52.377
But since we have
a couple of minutes,

32:52.401 --> 32:55.141
why don't we, uh, chat?

33:00.309 --> 33:02.287
Look, I don't mean
any disrespect.

33:02.311 --> 33:04.589
It's just,
now that Carlos is home,

33:04.613 --> 33:06.396
we need to get back
on our routine,

33:06.420 --> 33:09.664
and we can't do that if he keeps
running off to church

33:09.688 --> 33:12.037
and charity bake sales.

33:12.061 --> 33:15.140
We need "us" time.
Do you know what I mean?

33:15.164 --> 33:16.641
I do.

33:16.665 --> 33:19.074
Oh, good. Good.

33:19.098 --> 33:21.406
So it would really help
our marriage

33:21.430 --> 33:25.470
if you just backed off
for awhile, okay?

33:27.136 --> 33:28.253
No.

33:28.277 --> 33:29.984
Huh?

33:30.008 --> 33:32.117
I said no.

33:32.141 --> 33:36.061
I know what you said.
I'm wondering why you said it.

33:36.085 --> 33:38.993
Carlos is
a diamond in the rough,

33:39.017 --> 33:40.695
a flawed man to be sure,

33:40.719 --> 33:42.697
but someone who is
desperately searching

33:42.721 --> 33:44.699
for something to believe in.

33:44.723 --> 33:47.637
To satisfy your materialism,
he ended up breaking the law.

33:47.661 --> 33:50.535
To deal with your adultery,
he resorted to assault.

33:50.559 --> 33:52.537
As long as he's with you,

33:52.561 --> 33:54.779
he will never find
what he's looking for.

33:54.803 --> 33:56.620
Well, I guess he should have
thought of that

33:56.644 --> 33:58.113
before he married me.

33:58.137 --> 34:00.685
Some marriages
are meant to be annulled.

34:00.709 --> 34:03.188
What the hell kind of nun
are you?

34:03.212 --> 34:06.196
Look, if you try to come
between me and my husband,

34:06.220 --> 34:09.194
I will take you down. I grew
up on the south side of Chicago.

34:09.217 --> 34:11.196
If you wanna threaten me,

34:11.219 --> 34:13.728
you're gonna have to do
a lot better than that.

34:13.752 --> 34:17.161
You listen to me,
you little bitch.

34:17.186 --> 34:19.734
You do not want to start
a war with me.

34:21.360 --> 34:24.139
Well, I have god on my side.

34:24.163 --> 34:26.143
Bring it on.

34:49.158 --> 34:51.136
You called for a bellman?

34:51.159 --> 34:53.438
There's a charity dinner
taking place downstairs.

34:53.462 --> 34:56.509
My friend Bree Van De Kamp
is one of the co-chairs.

34:56.533 --> 34:59.104
Give her this note
and walk away.

34:59.128 --> 35:01.498
If she comes up
in the elevator, call me.

35:02.701 --> 35:05.310
You think you can do that?

35:05.334 --> 35:06.844
Yes, sir.

35:11.109 --> 35:12.557
Excuse me, ma'am?

35:12.581 --> 35:13.558
Yes.

35:13.582 --> 35:15.560
I was asked to give this to you.

35:15.584 --> 35:17.294
Oh, thank you.

35:30.599 --> 35:32.707
Barton.

35:32.731 --> 35:34.809
Hello, detective barton.
This is Bree Van De Kamp.

35:34.833 --> 35:37.850
I need to talk to you about George Williams.
Yeah, I was just getting ready to call you,

35:37.874 --> 35:39.344
Mrs. Van De Kamp.

35:39.368 --> 35:41.346
My men are at his house
right now,

35:41.370 --> 35:43.348
and they've uncovered evidence
that suggests.

35:43.372 --> 35:46.629
Mr. Williams was responsible
for your husband's death.

35:46.653 --> 35:47.722
What?

35:47.746 --> 35:52.197
Yeah, we found
Rex's prescription bottles

35:52.221 --> 35:55.129
and doctored potassium pills

35:55.153 --> 35:59.833
as well as some
disturbing diary entries.

36:02.231 --> 36:04.461
Mrs. Van De Kamp?

36:16.505 --> 36:18.383
Hello, sir.

36:18.407 --> 36:22.187
Yes. She's, uh, on her way up.

36:22.211 --> 36:24.251
Thank you very much.

36:29.918 --> 36:31.518
She loves me.

36:33.592 --> 36:35.292
She loves me not.

36:44.233 --> 36:46.551
She loves me.

36:49.678 --> 36:51.808
She loves me not.

37:00.249 --> 37:01.619
She loves me.

37:44.333 --> 37:47.742
Operator, this is
a bit embarrassing,

37:47.766 --> 37:49.474
but I've...

37:49.498 --> 37:51.476
I've swallowed some pills
by mistake.

37:51.500 --> 37:54.379
I think you need to call
an ambulance.

37:55.704 --> 37:58.583
Uh, uh, uh, they were...

37:58.607 --> 38:01.456
They were just vitamins.

38:01.480 --> 38:05.460
See? False alarm. I'm fine.

38:05.484 --> 38:07.494
Door's open.

38:18.797 --> 38:19.897
Hey.

38:23.332 --> 38:26.551
What were you thinking,
taking the pills?

38:26.575 --> 38:30.315
I didn't hurt Dr. Goldfine.

38:30.339 --> 38:33.488
And for you to...

38:33.512 --> 38:36.521
Think me capable of...

38:36.545 --> 38:38.345
That sort of...

38:41.690 --> 38:43.768
Violence...

38:43.792 --> 38:45.952
George.

38:48.757 --> 38:49.857
George.

38:52.831 --> 38:55.309
I'm sorry. It's the pills.

38:55.333 --> 38:57.512
Why are you telling me this?

38:57.536 --> 38:59.914
Because maybe
I don't have to die.

38:59.938 --> 39:02.647
I could face the police

39:02.671 --> 39:05.341
knowing that you
would be there for me...

39:07.516 --> 39:09.854
That you'd stay my friend.

39:09.878 --> 39:13.598
Then I'll have something
to live for.

39:13.622 --> 39:18.032
And then we'll call an ambulance
and they'll pump your stomach.

39:18.056 --> 39:20.856
Yes.

39:37.706 --> 39:40.585
I want to help you,

39:40.609 --> 39:43.588
but in order to do that,
I need to forgive you,

39:43.612 --> 39:48.022
and... I can't do that until
you admit what you've done.

39:50.559 --> 39:53.398
I didn't push goldfine.

39:53.422 --> 39:56.871
Yes, you did.

39:56.895 --> 39:59.395
But that's not what
I'm talking about.

40:01.670 --> 40:04.830
You killed Rex.

40:06.475 --> 40:08.953
But I know it wasn't
totally your fault

40:08.977 --> 40:11.886
because you're not well.

40:11.910 --> 40:16.691
So if you'll just be honest
with me,

40:16.715 --> 40:18.723
I can forgive you.

40:18.747 --> 40:21.426
It'll be the hardest thing
I've ever done,

40:21.450 --> 40:23.968
but I'll do it.

40:23.992 --> 40:29.103
But you have to... you have
to tell me the truth.

40:33.001 --> 40:35.580
Look, I'm in trouble here.

40:35.604 --> 40:37.742
We need to call someone.

40:37.766 --> 40:40.906
Not until you admit
what you've done.

40:43.612 --> 40:47.492
I love you.

40:47.516 --> 40:50.046
Anything I may have done,
I did for you.

40:52.821 --> 40:55.451
Because you wanted me to.

40:58.186 --> 41:01.186
You know you did.

41:19.147 --> 41:21.247
We need to call the ambulance.

41:25.814 --> 41:30.024
I... called them
while you were asleep.

41:32.591 --> 41:35.621
They're already on their way.

42:00.048 --> 42:03.497
It's not always that easy
to distinguish

42:03.521 --> 42:06.601
the good guys from the bad guys.

42:06.625 --> 42:09.095
Sinners can surprise you.

42:11.259 --> 42:13.699
And the same is true for saints.

42:17.706 --> 42:23.217
Why do we try to define people
as simply good or simply evil?

42:23.241 --> 42:28.052
Because no one wants to admit
that compassion and cruelty

42:28.076 --> 42:32.646
can live side by side
in one heart...

42:39.728 --> 42:41.728
And that anyone is capable
of anything.
