00:19.787 --> 00:21.589
IT'S A HIGHLY-PRESSURIZED
AIR CANNISTER

00:21.622 --> 00:25.293
THAT CAN INFLATE
A BLIMP IN 8.6 SECONDS.

00:25.326 --> 00:27.161

01:42.203 --> 01:46.207
PLEASE. I COULD SELL NUNCHUCKS
TO A NUN NAMED CHUCK.

01:47.308 --> 01:48.709

IF SHE SPOTS ANYTHING WEIRD,

03:43.691 --> 03:45.759
SHE WILL USE IT AS AN EXCUSE
FOR HER TO MOVE IN.

03:45.793 --> 03:48.296

FOR THE MOMENT WE HAVE
ALL BEEN WAITING FOR.

11:48.742 --> 11:51.178
I KNOW IT'S THE MOMENT
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.747
( heavy footsteps )

11:55.148 --> 11:59.386
EXO-SKELETON IN THE HOUSE!

12:01.021 --> 12:03.390
THAT'S RIGHT,
THE POWER OF TEN MEN

12:03.423 --> 12:05.725
IN A ONE SIZE FITS ALL SUIT.

12:05.759 --> 12:08.361
LEO, PLEASE DEMONSTRATE
BY LIFTING THIS TABLE.

12:08.395 --> 12:10.030
NOW, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

12:10.063 --> 12:11.731
SEE HOW ELEGANTLY HE--

12:11.765 --> 12:14.768
( Leo moaning )

12:17.104 --> 12:20.007
SMASHES MY TABLE
OF PRICELESS INVENTIONS.

12:20.040 --> 12:22.075
( gasps )

12:22.109 --> 12:26.046
GEE, IF ONLY I HAD WARNED YOU
THAT LETTING LEO HELP US

12:26.079 --> 12:27.981
WAS A BAD IDEA.

12:28.015 --> 12:29.316
LEO, STOP!

12:29.349 --> 12:32.319
I CAN'T!
I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING.

12:32.352 --> 12:34.054
THIS THING IS OUT
OF CONTROL!

12:35.022 --> 12:37.357
- WHOA!
- OH, NO!

12:37.390 --> 12:39.726
MY BAD!
YOU DIDN'T NEED THAT, DID YOU?

12:39.759 --> 12:41.829
OH!

12:41.862 --> 12:44.731
WAS THAT EXPENSIVE?

12:44.764 --> 12:46.199
LIVE WEB CAMS.

12:46.233 --> 12:48.768
YOU KNOW ANYTHING CAN
AND WILL HAPPEN,

12:48.802 --> 12:50.170
IT'S JUST EXTRAORDINARY.

12:50.203 --> 12:53.073
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE'LL CALL YOU BACK.

12:58.211 --> 13:00.948
**

13:00.981 --> 13:02.782
( yells )

13:02.816 --> 13:04.852
OKAY, THIS IS THE SCARIEST

13:04.885 --> 13:07.254
AND MOST AWESOME THING
THAT HAS EVER HAPPENED TO ME.

13:08.421 --> 13:10.223
ARE YOU USING ME
AS A SHIELD?

13:10.257 --> 13:13.126
YOU'RE BIONIC.

13:13.160 --> 13:14.294
( yelps )

13:14.327 --> 13:15.863
I DON'T GET IT.

13:15.896 --> 13:17.898
I MUST'VE TESTED IT,
LIKE 120 TIMES.

13:17.931 --> 13:19.532
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
COULD'VE HAPPENED.

13:19.566 --> 13:22.102
SOMETHING MUST'VE GONE
HAYWIRE WITH THE POWER SOURCE

13:22.135 --> 13:23.871
WHEN I REVERSED THE CONTROLS.

13:25.505 --> 13:27.040
I GUESS?

13:27.941 --> 13:29.309
I'M SORRY.

13:29.342 --> 13:30.911
I-- I DIDN'T MEAN
FOR IT TO GO BERSERK.

13:30.944 --> 13:32.312
I JUST WANTED
TO MESS WITH LEO.

13:32.345 --> 13:33.146
( gasps )

13:36.016 --> 13:37.517
WELL, NEXT TIME,
COULD YOU GIVE HIM A WEDGIE

13:37.550 --> 13:40.020
LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE?

13:42.222 --> 13:44.992
BIG D., I HOPE THIS DOESN'T
HURT OUR FRIENDSHIP,

13:45.025 --> 13:47.060
BUT I THINK I'M
ABOUT TO CRUSH YOU.

13:47.094 --> 13:48.395
( yells )

13:48.428 --> 13:51.364
NOT THE FACE!
NOT THE FACE!

13:51.398 --> 13:54.501
( powering down )

13:54.534 --> 13:56.336
I THINK IT
DRAINED ITS BATTERY!

13:56.369 --> 13:58.571
OH.

13:58.605 --> 14:02.242
STILL UNNECESSARILY HANDSOME.

14:02.275 --> 14:05.378
LEO, GET OUT
OF THAT THING.

14:05.412 --> 14:08.381
I KNOW THIS WASN'T EXACTLY WHAT
YOU WERE GOING FOR, BIG D.,

14:08.415 --> 14:11.318
BUT, MAN, ARE WE GONNA SELL
A TON OF THESE!

14:15.388 --> 14:17.457
CHASE, HOW COULD
YOU DO THIS?

14:17.490 --> 14:20.027
COME ON, WITH MY MECHANICALLY
INCLINED INTELLIGENCE,

14:20.060 --> 14:21.261
HOW COULD I NOT DO IT?

14:21.294 --> 14:22.529
WELL, YOU DID SOMETHING,
ALL RIGHT.

14:22.562 --> 14:24.297
YOU RUINED MY BIGGEST
SALE OF THE YEAR.

14:24.331 --> 14:25.598
NOW I'M GONNA HAVE TO
RESCHEDULE...

14:25.632 --> 14:27.267
THE CA--
YOU KNOW WHAT?

14:27.300 --> 14:29.236
IT'S NOT EVEN FUN
TO SAY ANYMORE.

14:29.269 --> 14:31.571
WHAT ON EARTH IS GOING
ON DOWN HERE?

14:31.604 --> 14:34.441
THE EXO-SKELETON WENT BERSERK
AND ALMOST CRUSHED ME.

14:34.474 --> 14:36.543
MY MOTHER IS UPSTAIRS.

14:36.576 --> 14:39.947
YEAH, OKAY.
YOU WIN.

14:39.980 --> 14:41.281
SHE'S BEEN ASKING
WHERE YOU GUYS ARE

14:41.314 --> 14:42.449
AND I'M RUNNING OUT
OF EXCUSES.

14:42.482 --> 14:44.351
I NEED EVERYONE UPSTAIRS

14:44.384 --> 14:46.619
ACTING LIKE A NORMAL
FAMILY NOW!

14:49.489 --> 14:51.424
WE SHOULD PROBABLY
DO WHAT SHE SAYS.

14:51.458 --> 14:53.393
SHE'S MORE PRONE TO VIOLENCE
THAN THE EXO-SKELETON.

14:55.628 --> 14:58.165
AND, CHASE, I AM VERY
DISAPPOINTED IN YOU.

14:58.198 --> 14:59.366
I DON'T WANT YOU
ON THE NEXT CALL.

15:03.003 --> 15:04.604
I WASN'T TRYING
TO BUMP YOU OUT.

15:04.637 --> 15:08.008
I WAS TRYING
TO SHOW YOU UP.

15:08.041 --> 15:10.510
YOU KNOW, ADD A LITTLE
SIZZLE TO YOUR STEAK.

15:10.543 --> 15:14.081
WELL, CONGRATULATIONS, LEO.
YOU WON.

15:14.114 --> 15:16.283
YOU GOT THE SIZZLE,
YOU GOT THE STEAK,

15:16.316 --> 15:18.585
YOU GOT THE WHOLE
STINKING COW!

15:21.688 --> 15:24.124
HEY, YOU'RE MY MANNY.

15:24.157 --> 15:25.558
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
NICE TO ME.

15:27.127 --> 15:30.663
( beeping )

15:33.100 --> 15:35.635
( mechanical whirring )

15:39.006 --> 15:41.374
DROSE.!

15:41.408 --> 15:44.611
ABOUT TIME. I WAS BEGINNING
TO THINK YOU WERE AVOIDING ME.

15:44.644 --> 15:46.579
I WAS-- UH, SICK.

15:46.613 --> 15:49.549
I MEAN I WAS SICK.
I WAS FEELING VERY ILL.

15:49.582 --> 15:51.518
AND I HAD A VERY
IMPORTANT PHONE CALL.

15:51.551 --> 15:54.487
UH, IT'S NOT NEARLY
AS IMPORTANT AS YOU.

15:54.521 --> 15:56.123
( chuckles )
NICE SAVE.

15:56.156 --> 15:57.424
THANK YOU.
I THOUGHT SO.

15:57.457 --> 16:00.593
HONEY, WHAT'RE
ADAM AND BREE DOING?

16:00.627 --> 16:03.663
YOU MEAN OUR
CHEF AND TRAINER?

16:03.696 --> 16:05.999
THAT EXPLAINS WHAT
THEY'RE DOING.

16:08.168 --> 16:11.171
UH, JUST A COUPLE
MORE MINUTES.

16:11.204 --> 16:14.041
TILL WHAT?
YOU MELT THE POT?

16:15.575 --> 16:16.709
YOU KNOW WHAT?

16:16.743 --> 16:18.545
LET'S JUST ALL SIT DOWN

16:18.578 --> 16:21.148
AND HAVE A NICE
DINNER TOGETHER.

16:21.181 --> 16:22.615
WE CAN SIT DOWN,

16:22.649 --> 16:25.218
BUT HAVING A NICE DINNER
JUST ISN'T GONNA HAPPEN.

16:26.719 --> 16:29.289
HEY, YOU'RE LEO'S MANNY

16:29.322 --> 16:31.458
AND YOU'RE LETTING
HIM NEAR A HOT STOVE?

16:33.493 --> 16:35.128
WATCH IT, LEO.

16:35.162 --> 16:37.197
YOU WANNA GET SENT TO BED
WITHOUT ANY SUPPER?

16:38.498 --> 16:41.068
YES.

16:42.769 --> 16:44.137
( pasta rattles )

16:44.171 --> 16:45.172
WHAT THE--?

16:45.205 --> 16:46.606
"PA-SGHETTI?"

16:46.639 --> 16:48.441
WHAT IN THE NAME OF GREAT
CEASAR'S GHOST

16:48.475 --> 16:50.043
IS GOING ON AROUND HERE?

16:50.077 --> 16:54.214
TRUST ME, THERE IS NOTHING
UNUSUAL GOING ON HERE.

16:54.247 --> 16:56.449
EVERYTHING IS
COMPLETELY NORMAL.

16:59.586 --> 17:00.653
( whirring, beeping )

17:02.222 --> 17:04.090
THAT WAS HORRIBLE TIMING.

17:06.626 --> 17:08.728
WHAT IS THAT?

17:08.761 --> 17:12.165
THAT IS ANOTHER MEMBER
OF OUR STAFF.

17:14.134 --> 17:16.736
GO AWAY, JAMES.
WE DON'T NEED YOU RIGHT NOW.

17:16.769 --> 17:19.672
BOY, I'M OLD, NOT SENILE,
AND THAT'S NO BUTLER.

17:19.705 --> 17:21.407
I'M OUT.

17:28.281 --> 17:30.650
ADAM, DON'T JUST SIT THERE.
GO TAKE THAT THING DOWN!

17:30.683 --> 17:33.052
NO! YOU DO THAT,

17:33.086 --> 17:36.489
AND SOMEONE WILL KNOW THAT
SOMEONE HAS CERTAIN ABILITIES!

17:38.258 --> 17:40.059
( all gasp )

17:40.093 --> 17:42.562
OH, WELL, GREAT.
NOW DINNER'S RUINED.

17:42.595 --> 17:46.399
DONALD, YOU'RE THE MAN
OF THE HOUSE, DO SOMETHING!

17:46.433 --> 17:48.301
RIGHT.
I'LL TAKE CARE OF THIS.

17:48.335 --> 17:50.503
( yells )

17:50.537 --> 17:51.804
MY HERO.

17:51.838 --> 17:55.142
WAIT, I HAVE AN IDEA.

17:56.709 --> 17:58.211
( yells )

17:58.245 --> 17:59.779
NOW, YOU SEE?

17:59.812 --> 18:02.149
YOUR LITTLE GIZMO'S
PUTTING US ALL IN DANGER.

18:02.182 --> 18:03.583
THAT ROBOT'S ABOUT
TO KILL US.

18:03.616 --> 18:05.252
SEE, BACK WHEN I WAS A KID
BACK IN THE DAY--

18:05.285 --> 18:07.420
YEAH, THAT'S A FASCINATING
STORY, ROSE.

18:07.454 --> 18:09.389
DO YOU MIND IF WE HEAR
ABOUT IT LATER?

18:09.422 --> 18:11.424
OH!

18:13.493 --> 18:16.829
IT'S DESTROYING OUR HOUSE
AND YOUR TOSSING PILLOWS AT IT.

18:16.863 --> 18:18.731
WELL, THEY'RE CALLED
THROW PILLOWS.

18:22.635 --> 18:24.737
TIME FOR THIS EXO
TO MEET ITS MATCH.

18:24.771 --> 18:26.639
THE ELECTROFIELD
DE-STABILIZER.

18:26.673 --> 18:27.707
GREAT IDEA, LEO.

18:27.740 --> 18:28.741
THANKS.

18:32.812 --> 18:34.714
HERE. YOU SHOULD DO IT.

18:34.747 --> 18:37.116
SORRY FOR STEALING
YOUR SIZZLE.

18:37.150 --> 18:39.419
NO, I'M THE ONE
WHO SHOULD BE SORRY.

18:39.452 --> 18:41.421
I JUST HAVE TO GET
USED TO THE IDEA

18:41.454 --> 18:42.822
OF HAVING ANOTHER
BROTHER AROUND.

18:42.855 --> 18:45.392
GUYS, I'M REALLY ENJOYING
THE HEARTFELT MOMENT,

18:45.425 --> 18:47.760
BUT I'M RUNNING OUT
OF PILLOWS HERE.

18:49.462 --> 18:51.831
SHALL WE TAKE THIS
BAD BOY DOWN TOGETHER?

18:51.864 --> 18:53.666
I'LL FLIP, YOU ZAP?

18:53.700 --> 18:56.135
( objects breaking )

18:56.169 --> 18:57.437
HEY, EXO!

19:03.576 --> 19:04.677
HERE COMES THE PAIN.

19:07.146 --> 19:09.482
OH. HEY.

19:12.485 --> 19:15.688
HEY, CHASE, DID WE
HAVE A PLAN B?

19:15.722 --> 19:17.757
HEY!

19:17.790 --> 19:19.125
( whirrs )

19:19.158 --> 19:21.694
NOBODY LAYS A HAND
ON MY GRANDSON.

19:21.728 --> 19:23.630
IT'S TIME TO PICK UP
THE HAT!

19:26.399 --> 19:28.768
WAY TO GO, GRANDMA!

19:28.801 --> 19:30.503
AND YOU DIDN'T EVEN
BREAK A HIP.

19:31.538 --> 19:33.306
( mechanical whirring )

19:36.509 --> 19:37.577
LOOK OUT, LEO!

19:40.780 --> 19:42.949
STAY CLOSE.

19:46.619 --> 19:48.888
( electricity crackling )

19:51.924 --> 19:53.326
- ALL RIGHT!
- YES!

19:53.360 --> 19:54.927
( cheering )

19:56.863 --> 19:59.666
SOMEBODY BETTER TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW.

19:59.699 --> 20:01.167
AND RIGHT NOW JUST PASSED,

20:01.200 --> 20:04.404
SO YOU'RE NOT TALKING
FAST ENOUGH.

20:04.437 --> 20:08.575
UH, ROSE, THERE IS A COMPLETELY
RATIONAL EXPLAINATION

20:08.608 --> 20:10.610
FOR ALL OF THIS.

20:10.643 --> 20:14.647
YOU ARE DELUSIONAL.
WHO WANTS DESERT?

20:16.649 --> 20:18.217
YOU KNOW WHAT, MOM?

20:18.251 --> 20:19.619
THIS IS OUR LIFE.

20:19.652 --> 20:22.589
OUR HOUSE MAY BE HIGH-TECH
AND CHAOTIC,

20:22.622 --> 20:24.257
BUT IT IS FULL OF LOVE.

20:24.291 --> 20:25.925
AND IT MAY NOT
BE PERFECT FOR YOU

20:25.958 --> 20:28.895
BUT IT IS PERFECT
FOR OUR FAMILY.

20:28.928 --> 20:30.530
WHAT FAMILY?

20:30.563 --> 20:33.466
WAIT A MINUTE,
WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?

20:33.500 --> 20:37.904
THEY ARE MY BROTHER'S KIDS.

20:37.937 --> 20:39.872
THAT I ADOPTED
WHEN HE DIED.

20:39.906 --> 20:45.345
FELL IN A VOLCANO.

20:48.781 --> 20:50.517
WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU
JUST SAY SO?

20:50.550 --> 20:52.352
NOW IT ALL MAKES SENSE.

20:52.385 --> 20:57.324
YOU'RE JUST A MODERN FAMILY
WITH A BUNCH OF ADORABLE KIDS.

20:57.357 --> 21:00.293
WHO IS GONNA NEED THEIR
GRANDMA AROUND ALL THE TIME.

21:00.327 --> 21:02.261
I CAN STAY FOR A FEW DAYS

21:02.295 --> 21:03.896
IN THE SPARE ROOM YOU
GOT DOWN THE HALL.
COME ON, BABY.

21:03.930 --> 21:05.598
I GOT MY OVERNIGHT
CASE IN THE CAR,

21:05.632 --> 21:07.467
AND GLADYS IS WATCHING POOCHIE
SO IT'S NO PROBLEM.

21:07.500 --> 21:08.668
DON'T THANK ME NOW.
COME ON.

21:08.701 --> 21:10.036
NO WAY!

21:12.539 --> 21:14.674
CHASE, YOU REALLY
MESSED UP TODAY,

21:14.707 --> 21:16.943
BUT YOU KIND OF MADE UP FOR IT
THE WAY YOU HELPED LEO

21:16.976 --> 21:18.478
LIKE A BROTHER.

21:18.511 --> 21:20.747
AND SINCE WE HAVE
TO RESCHEDULE IT ANYWAYS,

21:20.780 --> 21:23.350
I WANT YOU BOTH TO BE ON...

21:23.383 --> 21:24.884
THE CALL.

21:24.917 --> 21:26.786
HOO, IT'S BACK, BABY.

21:33.393 --> 21:35.261
OH, MAN. I AM STARVING.

21:35.294 --> 21:37.464
( doorbell )
OH, THAT MUST BE THE PIZZA.

21:37.497 --> 21:39.999
I'LL GET IT!

21:40.032 --> 21:42.869
LEO, WHAT'RE YOU DOING
IN THAT THING?

21:47.974 --> 21:49.809
( mechanical whirring )

21:49.842 --> 21:52.044
GETTING FREE PIZZA.

21:53.513 --> 21:55.515
