00:00.834 --> 00:01.735
- Tell me,
what's going on with you?

00:01.835 --> 00:02.769
- Could you just get out of
here?

00:02.870 --> 00:03.837
- Let me talk.
- And I won't listen.

00:03.937 --> 00:05.405
- Girl, I will snatch
those headphones.

00:05.506 --> 00:08.008
Sandra! You don't hear me?
Help me, Father! Girl!

00:08.108 --> 00:09.610
Y'all handle it, I can't
do that no more.

00:09.710 --> 00:10.811
- I'll go talk to her.

00:10.911 --> 00:12.212
I ain't gonna be scared to
talk to a teenager.

00:12.312 --> 00:13.647
Why you gotta be acting
like this?

00:13.747 --> 00:15.115
- Would you leave me alone?

00:15.215 --> 00:17.084
- I'm trying to tell you how to
get to your little boyfriend.

00:17.184 --> 00:19.019
- Okay, I'm listening.
- Go tell your parents

00:19.119 --> 00:20.954
that you sorry, you can
turn this around.

00:21.054 --> 00:23.123
Say it. "I'm sorry."

00:23.223 --> 00:24.324
- It's gonna work.
- Thank you.

00:24.424 --> 00:25.926

You said thank you.

00:26.026 --> 00:26.927

00:27.027 --> 00:27.961
Can I borrow that
for Halloween?

00:28.061 --> 00:29.363
- This is vintage.

00:30.539 --> 00:33.142
- ♪

00:33.242 --> 00:35.945
- Okay. What do you
think of this?

00:36.045 --> 00:38.814
- You--you want my--my
honest opinion?

00:38.914 --> 00:40.149
- Well, that's why
I asked you.

00:40.249 --> 00:42.851
- I don't know about that.

00:42.952 --> 00:44.019
It's the colors.
- What?

00:44.119 --> 00:46.322
- I don't--yeah, uh.

00:46.422 --> 00:48.757
- It's
taupe and blue jeans.

00:48.857 --> 00:50.292
- It's so blah.

00:52.895 --> 00:55.531
You got to get some
roar in it. Yeah.

00:55.631 --> 00:57.199
- I mean, it has a little
bit of pattern.

00:57.299 --> 00:59.702
- No, baby, if you wanna
really impress,

00:59.802 --> 01:02.204
you got to pop 'em
with some color.

01:02.304 --> 01:03.739
- What?
- Yeah, look at me.

01:03.839 --> 01:05.841
Look at me.
- Okay, I'm looking.

01:05.941 --> 01:08.077
- See, when I do 'em
like this...

01:08.177 --> 01:09.745
- SANDRA: Oh.
- Sorta...

01:09.845 --> 01:12.514
pow!

01:12.615 --> 01:14.183
- [laughs] Okay.

01:14.283 --> 01:15.884
- See, you gotta give 'em
so much color, they don't

01:15.985 --> 01:17.987
know where to look first.

01:18.087 --> 01:19.755
You don't even know where
to look, do you?

01:19.855 --> 01:21.357
- That's a good thing, why?

01:21.457 --> 01:23.559
- Because it distracts from
everywhere. See?

01:23.659 --> 01:25.361
You don't know which--look,
look at the pattern.

01:25.461 --> 01:26.829
You don't know which one
to look at.

01:26.929 --> 01:27.963
You wanna look right there,
don't you?

01:28.063 --> 01:30.132
You wanna look right--hey,
check this out.

01:30.165 --> 01:31.734
You see the shoes?

- Bam!

01:34.203 --> 01:35.704
- Wow.

01:35.804 --> 01:38.774
You ain't never seen
a flowers on a shirt like that.

01:38.874 --> 01:39.975
- I--I see it, yeah.

01:40.142 --> 01:41.443
- You wanna see something else?
- Okay.

01:41.543 --> 01:43.913
- Look how the belt match
the shoes.

01:44.013 --> 01:46.782
- Is that--is that neon green
crocodile?

01:46.882 --> 01:47.950
- What?

01:48.050 --> 01:49.985
They don't make these
no more.

01:50.152 --> 01:51.287
- It's interesting.

01:51.387 --> 01:53.956
- Don't forget
the suspenders.

01:54.056 --> 01:55.557
Neon green.

01:55.658 --> 01:58.060
You turn the lights out,
they'll glow.

01:58.160 --> 01:59.561
- They look like
they're glowing now.

01:59.662 --> 02:00.863
- Do they?

02:00.963 --> 02:02.364
- You could probably go
outside and direct traffic.

02:02.464 --> 02:03.365
I mean--
- Direct some traffic.

02:03.465 --> 02:04.667
They look good. You like that?

02:04.767 --> 02:06.235
You--I know, you--

02:15.077 --> 02:17.346
- No, this is natural.

02:17.446 --> 02:20.950
You know how long it took
me to build this?

There's gonna be blood and
loud-colored fabric

06:10.562 --> 06:13.799

- I know you do, baby.
I know.

of a story of when I was a kid.

06:57.476 --> 06:59.444
- Here we go.
- No, no, you ain't--

06:59.578 --> 07:00.946
you ain't heard this one.

07:01.046 --> 07:03.115
I go to the prison to see
my parents, and they would

07:03.215 --> 07:06.251
tell me this story, and it
was weird, because you know

07:06.351 --> 07:09.521
my mom and daddy would've
killed me two times--

07:09.554 --> 07:13.825
dead, dead--if I had talked
to them the way that child

07:13.925 --> 07:15.160
talked to both of y'all.

all the time from you.

07:18.530 --> 07:20.399
You tell us over and over,
every day.

07:20.532 --> 07:21.833
When you was a kid.
- What--

07:21.933 --> 07:24.236
- When your parents did this.
- Oh, don't--all I'm saying

07:24.336 --> 07:26.438
is why don't you do something
about it, man?

07:26.538 --> 07:29.408
- We are.
- By sending bozo in there?

07:31.543 --> 07:33.312
- I mean, she like clowns.

07:33.412 --> 07:36.815
- That is all the more reason
to be scared of her.

07:36.915 --> 07:39.951
- Grandpa, will you
cut it out, okay? Just stop.

07:40.052 --> 07:43.555
- Look, I don't know no
sane person that likes clowns.

07:43.622 --> 07:45.691
- Well, Mr. Brown likes clowns.

07:45.791 --> 07:47.893
- Case in point.
You may step down.

07:47.993 --> 07:49.261

We'll talk

I need to apologize
to you, Mom and Dad.

08:19.324 --> 08:20.425
I'm sorry.

08:26.164 --> 08:27.065
[in high-pitch] I'm sorry.

08:27.165 --> 08:28.233

I'm sorry.

08:28.333 --> 08:30.736
- Yeah.

08:33.005 --> 08:34.806

We forgive you.

08:48.587 --> 08:49.988

08:52.457 --> 08:53.892
- What did you do?
- Ssh, Cora, watch--

08:53.992 --> 08:58.230
watch--watch,
I'm a "psych-olol-ogist."

08:58.330 --> 09:00.198
- Look, I know I missed
the bus.

09:00.298 --> 09:02.267
- Okay, I can take you school.

09:02.367 --> 09:04.703
- Good, 'cause I know you don't
want me to take it anyways.

09:04.803 --> 09:06.271
- No, we don't.
- Hmm-mm.

09:06.371 --> 09:07.572
- SANDRA: Okay.

09:07.673 --> 09:08.640
Hit 'em with the eyes.

09:10.008 --> 09:12.678
Bust 'em with the smile.

09:44.443 --> 09:45.577
That's so sweet.

09:45.677 --> 09:49.881

10:09.601 --> 10:11.503
How much did you pay her?

10:11.570 --> 10:12.604
- What you talking about?

10:12.704 --> 10:14.006
- I know you paid her
something.

10:14.106 --> 10:16.141
- Cora, ain't nobody paid
nobody nothing.

10:16.241 --> 10:18.343
- Oh, you right, you're too
cheap to pay anybody anything.

10:18.510 --> 10:20.512
- Right.
- Exactly.

10:20.579 --> 10:22.381
- So--so how'd you do it?

10:22.514 --> 10:23.582
- How did I do what?

10:23.682 --> 10:24.650
- Go--
- Look at him, man.

10:24.750 --> 10:25.717
Don't play crazy.
- Right.

10:25.817 --> 10:29.621
- Ain't nobody playing.
- I see that.

10:29.721 --> 10:32.691
- Okay, I just told the girl
to be nice,

10:32.791 --> 10:34.593
and I told her why she should
be nice.

10:34.693 --> 10:36.528
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

10:36.561 --> 10:40.265

10:40.365 --> 10:42.534
hit her with the smile.

10:42.634 --> 10:46.371
- No way.
- Yes, way.

10:46.538 --> 10:47.439
- There's something
you're not telling us.

10:47.539 --> 10:48.807
- Yeah.

10:48.907 --> 10:50.842
- Cora, I know you're upset
that you're not

10:50.942 --> 10:53.111
the only Kid Whisperer
in the family.

10:53.211 --> 10:55.113
But I'm a Kid Whisper, too.

10:55.213 --> 10:57.883
'Cause I whisper
in 20 different languages.

10:57.983 --> 10:59.384
- Really?

10:59.551 --> 11:01.486
- [speaking Spanish]

11:01.520 --> 11:03.755
I just whispered in Mexican,
Cora.

11:03.855 --> 11:06.124
- Oh.
- Ah-ka-ka-ka-ka!

11:06.224 --> 11:07.059
- What's that?

11:07.159 --> 11:09.661
- I just whispered
in Swahili.

11:09.761 --> 11:11.930
- Get here, man, what did you
tell her, for real?

11:12.030 --> 11:14.800
- Ah, what does it matter
what I told her for real?

11:14.900 --> 11:16.768
- 'Cause I wanna put it
in a bottle and sell it.

11:16.868 --> 11:17.936
- Right.

11:18.036 --> 11:20.072
- This is man that can
turn a teenager around

11:20.172 --> 11:21.974
in minutes.
- Ooh.

11:22.074 --> 11:24.076
- Seconds even.

11:24.176 --> 11:25.410
- You could make millions.

11:25.510 --> 11:27.512
- Okay, y'all just better
get used to it.

11:27.579 --> 11:30.515
I'm a genius, and it's a gift.

11:30.582 --> 11:32.751
- Okay, Mr. Brown.
- And I'm out. Ha!

11:36.088 --> 11:37.422
- You know he paid her,
don't you?

11:37.522 --> 11:39.224
- Yeah, you right,
I know he did,

11:39.324 --> 11:41.426
but I just don't know
how much.

11:41.526 --> 11:43.795
- It is a miracle though.

11:43.895 --> 11:45.397
- But I'm gonna find out
how he did it.

11:45.530 --> 11:47.132
Trust me, I will find out.

11:47.232 --> 11:48.800
- ♪

11:51.578 --> 11:52.946
- Ooh, yeah, cover all of
this up, sweetheart.

11:53.046 --> 11:54.614
We--but we're gonna get rid
of all this.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.383
This all a mess.
It's terrible.

11:56.483 --> 11:58.785
Here, just sit that down
right there. Thank you so much.

11:58.885 --> 12:01.555
You look like you carry boxes
all the time, baby.

12:01.655 --> 12:02.822
Thank you. I appreciate it.

12:05.225 --> 12:06.526
Whoo.
- Hi.

12:06.626 --> 12:08.128
- Hey.

12:08.228 --> 12:11.231
- Well, how'd it go?
- I was gonna ask you that.

12:11.331 --> 12:13.767
- Wha--I mean, she just said
that she was sorry,

12:13.867 --> 12:17.537
and that she was wrong.
- Wow.

12:17.637 --> 12:20.540
So--so what did she say on
the way to school?

12:20.640 --> 12:21.474
- That's it.

12:21.575 --> 12:22.742
I mean, what'd he say?

12:22.842 --> 12:24.444
- He didn't say nothing.

12:24.544 --> 12:25.912
- He won't tell you?
- No, he over there

12:26.012 --> 12:28.215
in the kitchen
acting like he a king.

12:28.315 --> 12:30.116
- What?
- Yes.

12:30.217 --> 12:34.020
He over there talking about
he a Kid Whisperer. [laughs]

12:34.120 --> 12:36.256
And I went to college,
but I couldn't do it.

12:36.356 --> 12:37.791
- Uh.
- Yeah.

12:37.891 --> 12:39.759
- Well...
- What? what?

12:39.859 --> 12:42.829
You agree with him?
- Wha--but, uh no, um--

12:42.929 --> 12:45.665
Hmm-mm.
- Well, I have a masters.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.767
- Well, he got something else,
Cora.

12:47.867 --> 12:50.604
- What?
Besides a bunch of colors.

12:50.704 --> 12:52.639
- I don't even know what it is,
I don't care.

12:52.739 --> 12:54.574
But I'm just glad it worked.

12:54.674 --> 12:57.844
- Well, be careful.
- What you mean?

12:57.944 --> 13:00.747
- 'Cause it could be too good
to be true.

13:00.847 --> 13:02.782
- Cora.
- What?

13:02.883 --> 13:05.619
- See, you never struck
me as that kind of person.

13:05.719 --> 13:07.120
- What kind of person
you talking about?

13:07.153 --> 13:09.122
- The kind of person who would
be jealous of their father.

13:09.222 --> 13:11.258
- Girl, I am not jealous
of my father.

13:11.358 --> 13:13.760
- Yes, she is jealous of me.
- I am not jealous of you.

13:13.860 --> 13:14.928
And ain't nobody even
talking to you.

13:15.028 --> 13:16.429
- Cora, you jealous of me.

13:16.529 --> 13:18.632
It's my gift.
You coveted my gift.

13:18.732 --> 13:20.166
- Ain't nobody coveting no gift.
- Yes you is, Cora.

13:20.267 --> 13:23.536
You need to sit and represent.
- You mean repent.

13:23.637 --> 13:25.305
- Whatever it is,
you need to do it.

13:25.405 --> 13:28.208
- No, it would--and what did--
- Say, "I'm sorry, Lord.

13:28.308 --> 13:29.809
Forgive me."
- I'm sorry, Lord, forgive me.

13:29.910 --> 13:33.980
- That's right, now he tell--
he told me to tell you, "No."

13:34.147 --> 13:35.348
- And what did you say
to that girl?

13:35.448 --> 13:38.151
- Yeah, 'cause I really would
like to know, Mr. Brown.

13:38.184 --> 13:41.021
- I--okay.
- Come on, tell us.

13:41.154 --> 13:42.756
- Okay, you wanna hear it?
- CORA AND LEAH: Yeah.

13:42.856 --> 13:44.824
- Like to hear it,
here it go.

13:44.925 --> 13:48.895
It was 1976--
- Oh no.

13:48.995 --> 13:50.397
- If Cora don't wanna hear it,
I ain't telling.

13:52.098 --> 13:55.702
- Please, go on.
- Okay.

13:55.802 --> 13:58.838
It was 1945--

13:58.939 --> 14:00.974
- Now you just said it was 1976!

14:01.107 --> 14:02.909
- Cora, you gonna let me
tell my story, or you gonna

14:03.009 --> 14:04.211
keep interrupting me like that?
- Well, hurry up,

14:04.311 --> 14:06.479
tell the story.
- --let me tell it, let me tell

14:06.580 --> 14:07.981

- Go ahead and tell it

14:08.114 --> 14:09.749
then if you gonna tell it.
- Can't nobody tell it

14:09.849 --> 14:11.017

- Come on, tell it.

14:11.117 --> 14:14.187
- Let me tell it.
- Tell it.

14:14.287 --> 14:16.189
- I just told that girl
she can get more out of y'all

14:16.289 --> 14:19.659
if she nice rather than
being so mean.

14:19.759 --> 14:21.895
- That's all?
- Yeah, I told her. That's all.

14:21.995 --> 14:23.997
- What else did you say to her?

14:24.130 --> 14:25.832
- That's it.

14:25.932 --> 14:29.536
- Oh, no.
- What?

14:29.636 --> 14:32.372
- Oh, my gosh, so this girl
is about to start doing stuff

14:32.472 --> 14:34.374
just to be nice, thinking
she gonna get something.

14:34.474 --> 14:35.976
And when she don't get it,
she's gonna flip back

14:36.142 --> 14:37.644
into her old herself.
- No, she ain't,

14:37.744 --> 14:39.145
she on the nice mode.
- It's my child,

14:39.212 --> 14:41.348
I know her, how she is.
- All her sins have been

14:41.448 --> 14:43.149
washed away.
- Uh-uh-uh-uh.

14:43.216 --> 14:45.719
- Just cast in a sea
of forever-ness.

14:45.819 --> 14:47.153
- Hold on a minute.

14:47.187 --> 14:49.756
So, what did you promise
that girl?

14:49.856 --> 14:51.224
- I ain't promise her nothing.

14:51.324 --> 14:53.326
- Mr. Brown?
- Hmm?

14:53.426 --> 14:56.263
- Now you know you can't lie.
- Yes, I can.

14:56.363 --> 14:57.764
This my lie face.

14:58.932 --> 15:00.400
- What did you promise her?

15:00.500 --> 15:02.502
- I--

15:02.602 --> 15:05.171
I told the girl that you all
would meet with that boy.

15:05.272 --> 15:08.208
- CORA AND LEAH: What?
- That's "technically a man."

15:08.308 --> 15:10.377
- Oh Lord.
- I don't see nobody else

15:10.477 --> 15:12.012
trying to come up with
nothing that was gonna work

15:12.112 --> 15:13.713
good like I came up with.
- Are you talking about

15:13.813 --> 15:15.582
the sheriff's son?
- Yeah.

15:15.682 --> 15:17.250
- The bus driver?
- Yeah.

15:17.350 --> 15:20.220
- Mmmm. Okay.

15:20.320 --> 15:21.688
- What's the matter?

15:21.788 --> 15:23.256
- All hell is about
to break loose.

15:23.356 --> 15:25.425
- Why the hell about
to break loose?

15:25.525 --> 15:28.595
- Um, first of all, 'cause
Jeremy don't like his daddy,

15:28.695 --> 15:30.130
the sheriff,
and second of all,

15:30.163 --> 15:33.400
he is not gonna let her see
that big-head boy.

15:33.500 --> 15:34.334
- Oh.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.770
- Genius.

15:36.870 --> 15:38.672
You'd better not made it
worse, Mr. Brown.

15:38.772 --> 15:40.874
- I only make things better.
- CORA: Right.

15:40.974 --> 15:42.676
- And you stop rubbing
her negative off on ya.

15:42.776 --> 15:44.211
She just negative.

15:46.246 --> 15:48.748
That's why I don't like
y'all. You're negative.

15:48.848 --> 15:50.817
Gotta a negative spirit.
It's just dirty.

15:52.485 --> 15:53.987
- I'm sorry.

15:54.087 --> 15:56.156
- You'll come with me to
talk to Jeremy? Come on.

15:56.256 --> 15:58.325
- No, I'm--I'm--
I talk to kids.

15:58.425 --> 15:59.726
I don't talk to husbands.
- --use that

15:59.826 --> 16:01.127
counseling degree.
- For kids.

16:01.228 --> 16:02.996
- Out of retirement.
- Out--for kids.

16:03.096 --> 16:04.831
- Please.
- I don't counsel grown people.

16:04.931 --> 16:05.865
- It's kind of the same thing

16:05.966 --> 16:07.234
in a sense--
- No, it is not!

16:07.334 --> 16:08.902
- Same philosophies and stuff.
- Get over there and talk

16:09.002 --> 16:10.003
to your husband.
Hey, Jeremy!

16:10.103 --> 16:11.972
- Hey.

16:12.105 --> 16:13.974
- Hey, baby.
- Yeah?

16:14.107 --> 16:16.343
- So, I figured out why your
daughter been being so nice.

16:16.443 --> 16:18.245
- Oh, yeah? Why is that?

16:18.345 --> 16:21.848
- Uh, apparently, Mr. Brown told
her that if she was nice to us,

16:21.948 --> 16:26.386
that we would meet the boy.
- The sheriff's son?

16:26.486 --> 16:28.788
- Yes.
- What?

16:28.889 --> 16:31.157
- I know, I told him that we
would not do that.

16:31.258 --> 16:35.195
- Tuh, uh, yeah, that's right.
- I know.

16:35.295 --> 16:39.366
- That's--that's just crazy.
- I know.

16:39.466 --> 16:41.601
- I'm--I'm not meeting that boy.
- I know you ain't

16:41.701 --> 16:43.904
gonna do that.

16:44.004 --> 16:45.639
- Is Mr. Brown crazy?

16:45.739 --> 16:47.240
Crazier than we thought?
Must be.

16:47.340 --> 16:50.277
- Are you really asking
that question?

16:50.377 --> 16:51.378
- Hell no.

16:51.478 --> 16:53.246
He wouldn't even come
knock on the door.

16:53.346 --> 16:56.449
Duh, not like meeting no
disrespectful boy like that.

16:56.550 --> 16:57.751
And his daddy rude.

16:57.851 --> 17:00.186
- Ooh, so rude, honey.

17:00.287 --> 17:01.755
- I almost had to kick
his daddy's ass.

17:01.855 --> 17:03.223
- Ooh.
- Ask my grandfather.

17:03.323 --> 17:05.091
He was in there.
- Yeah, I wish I was in

17:05.158 --> 17:06.526
there for that.
- Yeah, he held me back.

17:06.626 --> 17:08.662
I was like...
"How dare he?"

17:08.762 --> 17:09.996
Like that's what I said.
- Ooh.

17:10.096 --> 17:12.999
Boy, you better stop that.
- BOTH: [laughs]

17:13.099 --> 17:14.768
- But for real, if that's
what she think,

17:14.868 --> 17:16.636
she got another thing coming.

17:16.736 --> 17:18.638
- Yes, she does.

17:18.738 --> 17:22.642
- I mean, ha, really?
- I know.

17:22.742 --> 17:25.212
- But it did get her
to be nice.

17:26.780 --> 17:27.981
- What you saying?

17:28.114 --> 17:29.883
- Well...
- Uh, what she was

17:29.983 --> 17:32.652
trying to say is that when--
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:32.752 --> 17:34.221
- Huh?
- Were you listening

17:34.321 --> 17:36.022
the whole time?
- Yeah.

17:36.122 --> 17:39.125
I was just standing there
listening like this...

17:39.226 --> 17:41.127
- Man.
- MR. BROWN: It's hands free.

17:41.228 --> 17:42.329
The kitchen ain't have
no doors.

17:42.429 --> 17:44.030
Ain't no doors around here
but the front door,

17:44.130 --> 17:47.267
so I can listen where
I wanna listen.

17:47.367 --> 17:51.071
The freedom to listen act
is in play.

17:51.104 --> 17:53.340
- Can you mind your business,
please, Mr. Brown?

17:53.440 --> 17:55.075
- Okay.

17:55.108 --> 17:56.877
You gotta talk to me like that,
I'm gonna mind--

17:56.977 --> 17:59.479
I'm gonna mind my business
right here.

17:59.579 --> 18:01.214
You ain't talk to me like
that when y'all was trying

18:01.314 --> 18:03.416
to get me to straighten
that little ol' girl out.

18:03.516 --> 18:05.785
- You're right. Okay.
- When y'all was scared.

18:05.886 --> 18:08.989
It should be, "Mr. Brown,
fix my life."

18:09.089 --> 18:10.657
- Whoa.
- It ain't gonna hurt you

18:10.757 --> 18:12.325
to talk to that boy.

18:12.425 --> 18:14.127
- Oh yeah, have you
met his daddy?

18:14.227 --> 18:15.695
- Huh-uh.
- Well, if you had met him,

18:15.795 --> 18:16.863
you wouldn't want him
in here.

18:16.963 --> 18:18.498
- Mm.
- Yeah, so why'd you say

18:18.598 --> 18:19.666
we would do that?
- Mm-hmm.

18:19.766 --> 18:21.935
- Y'all need to learn to
comprom--"contro-mie."

18:22.102 --> 18:23.703
- [doorbell rings]
- Compromise.

18:23.803 --> 18:26.573
- Oh, hell no, we don't.

18:26.673 --> 18:28.675
- I thought you was sleep.
- Well, I'm not sleep.

18:28.775 --> 18:30.644
- Well, I guess I was wrong.
- Yeah, and I was wrong

18:30.744 --> 18:32.913
about you being ugly.
- Well, you--you a lie.

18:33.013 --> 18:34.281
Ain't nobody ugly
over here.

18:34.381 --> 18:36.116
- What--the devil
is a liar.

18:36.182 --> 18:37.951
- You--you--you--have you
seen you?

18:38.118 --> 18:39.853
- Beat you to it, huh?
You look like--

18:39.953 --> 18:41.454
like bull --.
- And you look like

18:41.555 --> 18:43.023
a fat-lipped catfish.
- You look like

18:43.123 --> 18:45.959
fried cat ass.
- [laughs]

18:46.126 --> 18:49.362
- You look like bald cat--
- Ass.

18:49.462 --> 18:51.131
- Stop that cussing!
- No, he cussed.

18:51.231 --> 18:52.899
I ain't cuss.
- LEAH: Bad.

18:53.066 --> 18:54.334
- Make me sick.
- Would y'all hold on

18:54.434 --> 18:56.870
a minute? Hold on!
- Well, if you that sick,

18:56.970 --> 18:59.072
just go on and lay down
and don't wake up.

18:59.172 --> 19:01.308

19:01.408 --> 19:03.310
- ♪

19:07.914 --> 19:11.617
- Baby, we do need to talk.
- Y'all go ahead and talk then.

19:11.718 --> 19:13.720
- Mr. Brown?
- Huh?

19:13.820 --> 19:15.154
- Get out of these people's
business.

19:15.254 --> 19:17.056
- Oh, nobody was saying
"get out of my business"

19:17.156 --> 19:19.726
when y'all needed my $40,000.

19:19.826 --> 19:20.893
- Would you get out of there?

19:20.994 --> 19:22.895
- For that reason, I'm out.

19:22.996 --> 19:24.697
No, I'm out.

19:24.797 --> 19:26.265
- We done spent that money.

19:26.366 --> 19:28.034
- Mr. Brown!

19:28.134 --> 19:30.870
- Have you ever thought about
nobody did teached that boy

19:30.970 --> 19:32.105
nothing?
- Mm.

19:32.205 --> 19:33.473
- Y'all ever thought about
that?

19:33.573 --> 19:35.341
Maybe nobody taught him how
to come to the door,

19:35.441 --> 19:37.710
ring the doorbell.
Ding dong. "Who is it?"

19:37.810 --> 19:40.079
"It's me, Lindor."

19:40.179 --> 19:41.614
Y'all ain't never thought
about that, have ya?

19:41.714 --> 19:43.549
Nah, y'all wanna judge
the boy.

19:43.650 --> 19:46.686
Maybe taught him how to come to
the door and meet the parents.

19:46.786 --> 19:48.521
Stop judging people.

19:48.621 --> 19:51.824
Be judged by your own judgment
if you judge somebody.

19:51.924 --> 19:53.593
- What?
- More of a reason

19:53.693 --> 19:56.829
why we should meet him?

19:56.929 --> 19:58.965
- See, I'm good. I'm good.

19:59.065 --> 20:02.001
- Okay, so when she gets here
after school,

20:02.101 --> 20:04.704
we'll talk to her and let
her know...

20:04.804 --> 20:06.773
we'll meet him.

20:06.873 --> 20:09.809
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

20:09.909 --> 20:11.411

20:11.544 --> 20:12.812

mind your business.

20:12.912 --> 20:14.013

20:14.113 --> 20:16.916
- Yes, baby, I'm sure.

20:17.016 --> 20:19.085
- Okay, I tell you what, though.

20:19.185 --> 20:21.587
Let her seem like it was
her idea. Okay?

20:21.688 --> 20:23.189
- Alright, you got it.

20:23.289 --> 20:26.059
- Make--make sure it look
like she's leading.

20:26.159 --> 20:29.228
Make sure that she look like
the head and you the neck.

20:29.329 --> 20:30.563
- Okay.

20:30.663 --> 20:32.999
- I don't know what that mean,
but it just sound good.

20:33.099 --> 20:35.234
- It makes sense though.
- The faster y'all learn

20:35.335 --> 20:38.571
that I'm genius around here, the
faster we can get stuff done.

20:38.604 --> 20:41.441
