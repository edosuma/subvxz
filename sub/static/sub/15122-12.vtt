WEBVTT

00:03.704 --> 00:04.505
So am I right?

00:04.572 --> 00:06.507
Is it the universal
ball joint?

00:06.574 --> 00:09.343
Well, the universal ball joint's
no picnic,

00:09.410 --> 00:11.412
but your transmission's been
leaking about four spots.

00:11.479 --> 00:13.647
Why didn't you have me
look at this thing earlier?

00:13.714 --> 00:16.016
'Cause you're never
lucid this long.

00:16.084 --> 00:17.418
Had a chance last
week, but by the time

00:17.485 --> 00:18.486
I got you in
the coveralls,

00:18.552 --> 00:19.687
you thought you were
an exterminator,

00:19.753 --> 00:21.055
spent three and a half
hours under the house.

00:21.122 --> 00:22.290
I kill anything?

00:22.356 --> 00:24.125
Two rats and a snake.
(chuckles)

00:24.192 --> 00:27.461
Man... the things
you people tell me I do.

00:27.528 --> 00:30.398
I tell you,
getting old is quite a ride.

00:30.464 --> 00:33.767
Is that Maw Maw
underneath the car?

00:33.834 --> 00:35.569
Damn it, Burt!

00:35.636 --> 00:37.471
We said, next
time she's lucid,

00:37.538 --> 00:39.340
we'd get her to fix
the sewing machine.

00:39.407 --> 00:40.574
Well, you weren't here.

00:40.641 --> 00:42.042
Finders keepers.

00:42.110 --> 00:43.644
I got dibs on her next.

00:43.711 --> 00:45.379
I'm gonna get her to put
a phone jack in my bedroom.

00:45.446 --> 00:48.249
Jimmy, bambino, come here.

00:50.184 --> 00:51.719
What?

00:51.785 --> 00:54.155
Speak Spanish for Carmela.

00:54.222 --> 00:56.157
Uh, I really don't...
Jimmy.

00:56.224 --> 00:57.491
She's my boss.

00:58.659 --> 01:00.861
(sighs)

01:00.928 --> 01:01.995
Hola, Rosa.

01:02.062 --> 01:03.964
Mi llamo es Jimmy.

01:04.031 --> 01:07.067
(both laugh)

01:07.135 --> 01:08.369
(over pronouncing):
Hola, Rosa.

01:08.436 --> 01:10.204
Mi llamo es Jimmy.

01:10.271 --> 01:12.540
(both laughing)

01:16.210 --> 01:17.645
Buenas noche.

01:17.711 --> 01:19.713
(both laughing)

01:26.019 --> 01:32.460
* Here we go, oh, oh, oh,
Daddy-o, oh, oh, oh *

01:32.526 --> 01:34.995
* Birth control, no, no, no *

01:35.062 --> 01:38.499
* Let it roll, oh, oh, oh *

01:38.566 --> 01:41.169
* Oh *

01:41.235 --> 01:44.572
* Oh... *

01:44.638 --> 01:49.743
* Here we go, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh! *

01:54.415 --> 01:58.419
I saw Javier and Marcus riding
their bike by the propane place.

01:58.486 --> 02:01.455
They said to call you
a wuss-face punk-ass or...

02:01.522 --> 02:03.724
wuss-ass punk-face.
I don't know.

02:03.791 --> 02:05.025
It was those four words.

02:05.092 --> 02:07.295
Yeah, we were at the park,
and they kept wanting to

02:07.361 --> 02:08.562
freak people out
by driving the van

02:08.629 --> 02:10.264
through the parking lot
with Hope on the roof.

02:10.331 --> 02:11.799
That's fantastic.

02:11.865 --> 02:12.933
Did people freak?

02:13.000 --> 02:14.067
Oh, I didn't do it.

02:14.134 --> 02:15.736
They called me lame
and took off.

02:15.803 --> 02:17.738
You got a red nine
for that ten.

02:17.805 --> 02:18.806
Damn it, Jimmy.

02:18.872 --> 02:20.441
How am I supposed to learn?

02:20.508 --> 02:22.310
Well, you're growing apart.
You have a baby

02:22.376 --> 02:23.411
and they don't.

02:23.477 --> 02:24.778
Yeah, we had a
lot of friends

02:24.845 --> 02:26.380
before you came along
and scared them off.

02:26.447 --> 02:29.283
Pretty amazing, huh, guys?

02:29.350 --> 02:31.585
Well, that's gross.

02:31.652 --> 02:33.621
We're gonna go
back to prom now.

02:35.623 --> 02:37.825
Being a young parent
can be lonely.

02:37.891 --> 02:39.893
It's hard to meet people
you can connect with.

02:39.960 --> 02:42.430
We always had each other,
right, honey bunny?

02:43.597 --> 02:44.765
Well, that doesn't help me out.

02:44.832 --> 02:45.966
Oh, yeah.

02:46.033 --> 02:47.801
(laughs):
Your honey bunny
got electrocuted.

02:47.868 --> 02:50.137
Well, you always
got us as friends.

02:50.204 --> 02:51.905
But don't get too smothery.

02:51.972 --> 02:53.441
We like our space.

02:56.577 --> 02:58.346
Listen, I've been thinking about

02:58.412 --> 03:00.214
how sad it is that you have
no friends...

03:00.281 --> 03:01.249
No dad friends.

03:01.315 --> 03:02.683
I mean, I have friends,

03:02.750 --> 03:04.084
they just don't understand
what I'm going through.

03:04.151 --> 03:05.653
Fine, split hairs.
It's still sad.

03:05.719 --> 03:06.654
But guess what.

03:06.720 --> 03:08.956
I think I just found you
the perfect guy.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.090
Get out of here. Really?

03:10.157 --> 03:11.091
Yeah.

03:11.158 --> 03:12.192
Is he tall?

03:12.260 --> 03:13.160
Uh, he's
medium height.

03:13.227 --> 03:14.262
Is that a
deal breaker?

03:14.328 --> 03:15.696
Uh, yeah, it's not
a deal breaker,

03:15.763 --> 03:18.332
it's just, you know, you start
to picture your ideal guy.

03:18.399 --> 03:20.534
You know what,
I need to stay open.

03:20.601 --> 03:22.970
As long as it's
someone who gets me.

03:23.036 --> 03:25.473
And I wouldn't complain
if he's outdoorsy.

03:25.539 --> 03:27.408
Oh.

03:27.475 --> 03:30.110
Okay, everyone, listen up.

03:30.177 --> 03:31.979
(baby crying)
Eddie and I have lost

03:32.045 --> 03:33.547
a-a stuffed blue elephant.

03:33.614 --> 03:36.216
It has green feet
and the nose is a little bent.

03:36.284 --> 03:38.151
Ma'am, police your area.

03:38.218 --> 03:41.389
If we don't find this thing,
this kid is gonna lose his mind.

03:41.455 --> 03:42.690
And I will not have
another Chernobyl

03:42.756 --> 03:44.458
like I had
in the cell phone store.

03:44.525 --> 03:47.060
Look at him--
frazzled, in over his head.

03:47.127 --> 03:49.397
He would totally get me.

03:49.463 --> 03:50.998
(speaks baby talk)

03:51.064 --> 03:52.566
(chuckles)

03:52.633 --> 03:53.601
(cooing)

03:53.667 --> 03:55.569
Yeah.

03:58.205 --> 03:59.373
'Sup?

03:59.440 --> 04:02.443
Uh, can I get one pound
of fake crab salad.

04:04.445 --> 04:06.747
I see you got a kid there.

04:06.814 --> 04:07.815
Cute.

04:07.881 --> 04:08.949
What is he, about one?

04:09.016 --> 04:10.250
Yeah.

04:10.318 --> 04:11.285
My daughter's the same age.

04:11.352 --> 04:12.620
Really?

04:12.686 --> 04:14.422
I don't meet a lot
of other young dads.

04:14.488 --> 04:17.090
Yep. Doing it alone.

04:17.157 --> 04:18.626
Single dad style.

04:18.692 --> 04:19.993
Me, too.

04:20.060 --> 04:21.529
Wow.

04:21.595 --> 04:22.696
That's cool.

04:22.763 --> 04:24.632
Yeah.

04:26.199 --> 04:27.868
Well...

04:29.570 --> 04:30.738
Here's your fake crab salad.

04:30.804 --> 04:31.839
All right.

04:31.905 --> 04:33.607
Uh, yo, take care.

04:37.545 --> 04:39.079
Sometimes we get real crab.

04:39.146 --> 04:40.381
In here.

04:40.448 --> 04:41.649
Uh, goes pretty quick,

04:41.715 --> 04:43.517
but I could put
some aside for you

04:43.584 --> 04:45.919
if-if, uh, if you left
your number.

04:45.986 --> 04:47.120
You know,

04:47.187 --> 04:48.956
if you like real crab.

04:49.022 --> 04:51.058
I love real crab.

04:53.193 --> 04:55.295
Got the digits.

05:06.206 --> 05:08.008
Oh, come on.

05:08.075 --> 05:09.309
Just call
him already.

05:09.377 --> 05:10.378
I'm running
out of battery.

05:10.444 --> 05:11.812
I will call him
when I'm ready.

05:11.879 --> 05:13.847
And it's not helping
that you're recording this.

05:13.914 --> 05:16.550
You're making a new friend;
it's a big moment.

05:16.617 --> 05:18.352
I don't know
what you're nervous about.

05:18.419 --> 05:20.253
Said you two fellas had a spark.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.622
I'm jealous.

05:21.689 --> 05:23.524
I can't remember
the last time I had a spark

05:23.591 --> 05:24.525
with a potential guy friend.

05:24.592 --> 05:26.694
All right, I'll do this.

05:29.363 --> 05:32.232
I thought I had a spark with
a guy at the post office.

05:32.299 --> 05:34.935
Locked his keys in the car
and I was helping him out.

05:35.002 --> 05:36.303
Chatting up a storm.

05:36.370 --> 05:38.839
Got the door open, he hands
me five bucks and drives off.

05:38.906 --> 05:40.674
I wasn't looking for money.

05:40.741 --> 05:42.142
I was looking for a friend.

05:42.209 --> 05:43.644
I know.

05:43.711 --> 05:45.513
You told me that story.

05:45.579 --> 05:47.415
Shh! I've got his voice mail.

05:47.481 --> 05:48.716
Play it cool.

05:48.782 --> 05:50.350
...leave a message or text me.

05:50.418 --> 05:53.454
Justin... hi-ho.

05:53.521 --> 05:55.288
Oh, hi-ho.

05:55.355 --> 05:56.323
What was that?

05:56.390 --> 05:57.858
I sound like a dwarf.

05:57.925 --> 05:59.192
Not that there's anything
wrong with dwarves,

05:59.259 --> 06:00.528
in case your son is a dwarf.

06:00.594 --> 06:02.730
I mean, he looked normal,
for a baby.

06:02.796 --> 06:06.133
But you don't really know
until they're, like, three.

06:06.199 --> 06:08.769
Oh, this is not going
as well as I'd hoped.

06:08.836 --> 06:10.337
You haven't said
your name yet.

06:10.404 --> 06:11.739
(whispers):
Oh, yeah.

06:11.805 --> 06:14.241
Sorry. This is Jimmy
from the grocery store.

06:14.307 --> 06:16.444
I meant you could
still hang up.

06:16.510 --> 06:19.046
RECORDED VOICE:
If you're satisfied
with your message, hang up.

06:19.112 --> 06:20.914
To rerecord, press one.

06:20.981 --> 06:21.982
(sighs)

06:22.049 --> 06:23.784
I can rerecord.

06:23.851 --> 06:26.353
If you're satisfied
with your message, hang up.

06:26.420 --> 06:27.955
To rerecord, press one.

06:28.021 --> 06:29.557
Aw, it doesn't work
with a rotary!

06:29.623 --> 06:31.258
Why do we live in the '70s?

06:31.324 --> 06:32.493
I got this.

06:32.560 --> 06:33.861
Where are you going?
Hold on.

06:33.927 --> 06:36.464
I think I can
do a one.

06:39.099 --> 06:40.634
* Beep *

06:40.701 --> 06:41.702
(lower):
* Beep *

06:41.769 --> 06:43.637
No, I think it's lower.

06:43.704 --> 06:44.705
(higher note):
* Beep *

06:44.772 --> 06:45.573
Yeah.

06:45.639 --> 06:46.640
You have pressed five.

06:46.707 --> 06:48.208
Five is an invalid option.

06:48.275 --> 06:49.309
(groans)

06:49.376 --> 06:50.811
Oh, damn, I
was so close!

06:50.878 --> 06:52.746
If you're satisfied
with your message, hang up.

06:52.813 --> 06:55.148
I use this
when I call Moviefone.

06:55.215 --> 06:56.884
(plays note)

06:56.950 --> 06:58.318
Message deleted.

06:58.385 --> 06:59.887
Rerecord your message.

06:59.953 --> 07:02.422
JUSTIN:
Please leave a message
or text me.

07:02.490 --> 07:05.759
Hey, Justin, this is Jimmy,
uh, from the grocery store.

07:05.826 --> 07:08.529
I was just figuring, uh,
you're a dad and I'm a dad,

07:08.596 --> 07:09.797
so why should

07:09.863 --> 07:11.965
a dad and a dad be sad
when fun could be had?

07:12.032 --> 07:13.601
Whew.

07:13.667 --> 07:14.568
(plays note)

07:14.635 --> 07:16.003
Yo, J-Dawg.

07:16.069 --> 07:18.038
It's J... Dawg.

07:18.105 --> 07:19.573
(plays note)

07:19.640 --> 07:21.141
Hey, my brother
from another mother.

07:21.208 --> 07:22.242
Oh, God, that was creepy.

07:22.309 --> 07:24.144
(plays note)

07:24.211 --> 07:26.547
Hey, Justin, this is
Jimmy from the store.

07:26.614 --> 07:27.615
I was wondering...

07:27.681 --> 07:29.449
MAW MAW:
Hello?

07:29.517 --> 07:30.751
Who is this?

07:30.818 --> 07:32.953
Maw Maw, it's me.

07:33.020 --> 07:34.688
Shh. I'm on
the phone.

07:34.755 --> 07:35.556
Hello?

07:35.623 --> 07:36.524
Who is this?

07:36.590 --> 07:37.791
It's me!

07:37.858 --> 07:38.926
Shh!

07:40.093 --> 07:41.194
Who is this?

07:41.261 --> 07:42.830
(plays note)

07:42.896 --> 07:43.597
Hello, Justin.

07:43.664 --> 07:44.965
Jimmy C. here.

07:45.032 --> 07:45.599
(plays note)

07:45.666 --> 07:47.200
Wha... I thought that was good.

07:47.267 --> 07:49.570
Come on. "Jimmy C."?
We're better than that.

07:52.172 --> 07:53.206
I can't do this.

07:53.273 --> 07:54.174
(phone ringing)

07:57.277 --> 07:58.278
Hello.

07:58.345 --> 07:59.279
Hey, this is Justin.

07:59.346 --> 08:00.380
Did somebody there call me?

08:00.447 --> 08:01.949
Oh, uh, yeah.
This is Jimmy.

08:02.015 --> 08:03.884
Jimmy Chance from
the grocery store.

08:03.951 --> 08:05.118
(whispers):
It's him.

08:05.185 --> 08:07.487
Oh, oh, oh.
The crab meat come in yet?

08:07.555 --> 08:09.256
Uh, no, not yet.

08:09.322 --> 08:12.225
But I was thinking, you
have a kid, I have a kid.

08:12.292 --> 08:14.928
Uh, apparently, it's good
for them to socialize.

08:14.995 --> 08:16.664
Oh, we should have
a play date.

08:16.730 --> 08:18.098
Yeah, I was thinking
the same thing.

08:18.165 --> 08:20.100
Yes, we should
have a play date.

08:21.802 --> 08:23.804
All right,
well, uh...

08:23.871 --> 08:25.105
Hello?

08:25.172 --> 08:26.607
Maw Maw, I'm
on the phone!

08:26.674 --> 08:28.041
Who is this?

08:30.711 --> 08:32.312
Your brain gets scrambled,

08:32.379 --> 08:33.981
and you forget
how to be with adults.

08:34.047 --> 08:34.882
I know.

08:34.948 --> 08:36.283
I burped a coworker once.

08:36.349 --> 08:38.285
She was chugging a soda,
and I just went on instinct.

08:38.351 --> 08:39.753
(laughs)

08:39.820 --> 08:40.788
Any gas come out?

08:40.854 --> 08:42.556
Fair amount.
(laughs)

08:42.623 --> 08:44.491
WOMAN:
Ooh, goodness!

08:44.558 --> 08:46.293
Ooh, Lord have
mercy! Oh!

08:46.359 --> 08:49.196
You know, I don't care
what the hell SkyMall said

08:49.262 --> 08:50.664
this would do for my calves.

08:50.731 --> 08:53.066
Hard to keep my balance
on these things.

08:53.133 --> 08:55.435
Mom, this is Jimmy.

08:55.502 --> 08:57.070
JIMMY:
It's nice to meet you.

08:57.137 --> 08:59.172
I was wondering if Justin had
the whole place to himself.

08:59.239 --> 09:01.008
No, I let my mom
and dad live here.

09:01.074 --> 09:03.944
Oh, it's the least he could do,
since we own the place.

09:04.011 --> 09:05.746
Justin, why don't you
go get some wine.

09:05.813 --> 09:07.881
I want to hear all
about your new friend.

09:07.948 --> 09:08.682
Yeah, okay.

09:08.749 --> 09:11.218
(grunting)

09:11.284 --> 09:12.419
(doorbell rings)

09:12.485 --> 09:13.887
Uh, I'll get it.

09:15.288 --> 09:17.057
(grunting)

09:17.124 --> 09:18.358
Okay.

09:18.425 --> 09:19.893
Hey, come on in.

09:19.960 --> 09:22.162
(sighs)

09:22.229 --> 09:23.964
There we go.

09:24.031 --> 09:24.998
Hey, listen,

09:25.065 --> 09:29.169
um, my husband said
that one of you is not

09:29.236 --> 09:31.672
getting high enough
with the squeegee in the shower,

09:31.739 --> 09:32.706
and he's getting mildew

09:32.773 --> 09:33.774
in the corners.

09:33.841 --> 09:35.008
So...
Jimmy.

09:36.076 --> 09:37.978
Hi, Rosa.

09:38.045 --> 09:40.313
Oh, you guys
know each other?

09:40.380 --> 09:43.450
It's a small world!

09:43.516 --> 09:44.785
They clean your house, too?

09:44.852 --> 09:46.119
They don't, but I do.

09:46.186 --> 09:49.589
Yeah, uh, Sylvia, this is,
this is my mom Virginia.

09:51.324 --> 09:52.826
I know her name.

09:52.893 --> 09:54.027
Hi!

09:54.094 --> 09:55.095
Hello!

09:55.162 --> 09:56.129
Nice to meet you.

09:56.196 --> 09:57.765
(laughs)

09:59.833 --> 10:01.268
Well, um, we actually have
a couple houses

10:01.334 --> 10:02.936
to clean after this,
so we should probably

10:03.003 --> 10:04.504
get started, huh? Yeah.
Okay.

10:04.571 --> 10:06.674
Nice.

10:10.744 --> 10:11.645
(grunts)

10:11.712 --> 10:13.013
(sighs)

10:13.080 --> 10:15.515
So... tell me
about yourself.

10:15.582 --> 10:17.017
Um...

10:17.084 --> 10:19.787
what do you do and
how you ended up

10:19.853 --> 10:21.421
with this beautiful
baby girl.

10:21.488 --> 10:24.457
You know, this is crazy.

10:24.524 --> 10:25.659
Jimmy's Mom?

10:25.726 --> 10:26.660
Yeah.

10:26.727 --> 10:28.461
Come over here and sit with us.

10:28.528 --> 10:29.629
Have a glass
of wine.

10:31.398 --> 10:33.934
Oh, I don't think my boss
would want me to do that.

10:34.001 --> 10:36.103
Oh, that's crazy.

10:36.169 --> 10:40.774
She's gonna come sit down with
us and have a glass of wine.

10:40.841 --> 10:42.109
It's okay by me.

10:44.177 --> 10:46.246
Come, please.

11:02.262 --> 11:04.597
(giggling)

11:04.664 --> 11:06.133
It's the '05.

11:06.199 --> 11:08.001
Mmm!
Nice, right?

11:08.068 --> 11:09.269
Hmm!

11:09.336 --> 11:12.139
I really like your sheets.

11:12.205 --> 11:13.540
Thank you.

11:13.606 --> 11:15.375
They're very easy to fold.

11:19.246 --> 11:20.680
You know what?

11:20.748 --> 11:23.516
I really should get started
working.

11:23.583 --> 11:26.286
This just doesn't feel fair to
Rosa and Carmela.

11:26.353 --> 11:28.555
You know, you
are totally right.

11:28.621 --> 11:29.823
Everybody, sit down.

11:29.890 --> 11:32.392
Sit down.
No work today.

11:32.459 --> 11:33.927
No work.
No trabajo.

11:33.994 --> 11:37.097
Yeah, sit down.
Please. (giggling)

11:37.164 --> 11:41.802
So, what do you do on
your day off, Rhonda?

11:41.869 --> 11:43.070
It's Rosa.

11:47.040 --> 11:50.477
Because it's weird, that's why.

11:50.543 --> 11:53.480
I was supposed to be cleaning
their house, but instead...

11:53.546 --> 11:56.216
Everyone was sitting around
sipping on my favorite pinot.

11:56.283 --> 11:58.218
I mean, look, I
am sure they are

11:58.285 --> 12:01.021
very nice people, but employers
and employees...

12:01.088 --> 12:04.057
...are not supposed to hang out
together.

12:04.124 --> 12:05.759
Friends are supposed to
compliment

12:05.826 --> 12:07.527
each other on their hair--

12:07.594 --> 12:09.930
not pull big wads of it out of
the other one's shower drain.

12:09.997 --> 12:11.264
I'm sorry, Jimmy...

12:11.331 --> 12:13.700
...but you're gonna have to find
a different friend.

12:13.767 --> 12:16.569
Look, that's not fair.
Just 'cause you're
uncomfortable. Dad?

12:16.636 --> 12:19.039
Back me up here.
I'm with your mother
on this one.

12:19.106 --> 12:20.874
They sat around drinking
all my wine,

12:20.941 --> 12:22.810
when they were supposed
to be doing my laundry.

12:22.876 --> 12:25.045
My Snuggy's in the hamper.

12:25.112 --> 12:28.916
Tell me, how am I
supposed to watch Bones
tonight and stay warm?

12:28.982 --> 12:30.984
You keep looking.
I'm sure you'll...

12:31.051 --> 12:32.252
...find another guy

12:32.319 --> 12:34.154
who might not be your dream
friend, but at least

12:34.221 --> 12:36.056
he'll be poor like us.

12:36.123 --> 12:37.858
Oh, but this guy is...
...perfect for me!

12:37.925 --> 12:40.693
Besides, Jimmy already invited
us over for...

12:40.760 --> 12:42.229
...dinner here with us,
Saturday night.

12:42.295 --> 12:43.363
And they...

12:43.430 --> 12:45.866
...accepted, so
we have to go.

12:45.933 --> 12:46.834
Canceling now would be...

12:46.900 --> 12:48.235
...rude!
We invited them;

12:48.301 --> 12:50.838
they said yes.
We're not canceling.

12:50.904 --> 12:52.339
Fine!
Fine!

12:52.405 --> 12:53.473
Fine!
Fine!

12:53.540 --> 12:55.242
(cooing)

12:55.308 --> 12:57.277
You'll see.
It'll be fun.

12:57.344 --> 13:00.747
Speaking of fun, a crazy thing
happened at work today.

13:00.814 --> 13:04.284
So, I'm raking the lawn for this
new client, Mrs. Waterman,

13:04.351 --> 13:07.554
when suddenly I am stung
by this horrible smell.

13:07.620 --> 13:08.788
And I knew what it was.

13:08.856 --> 13:09.957
It was...

13:10.023 --> 13:11.758
...my secretary Donna, right?

13:11.825 --> 13:13.293
Now, she is a big girl

13:13.360 --> 13:15.095
and has no business
being on top

13:15.162 --> 13:17.064
of a ladder
in the first place.

13:17.130 --> 13:20.067
So, I come through the door
and I'm...

13:20.133 --> 13:24.171
...face to face with the
biggest, hairiest, smelliest...

13:24.237 --> 13:26.339
...crack--
right there in the ladder!

13:26.406 --> 13:27.774
And down she goes.

13:27.841 --> 13:29.409
So, I try to help by...

13:29.476 --> 13:32.679
...reaching deep into her shrub.
I'm up to my shoulder.

13:32.745 --> 13:36.516
Again, I'm telling you, this is
a huge woman! So...

13:36.583 --> 13:38.919
I'm digging in there,
feeling around.

13:38.986 --> 13:39.953
I pull out...

13:40.020 --> 13:42.389
...my lawyer, John Reynolds.

13:42.455 --> 13:45.192
And he doesn't think she'll sue
if I send an apology note

13:45.258 --> 13:48.328
and a nice gift basket filled
with delicious little...

13:48.395 --> 13:49.696
...dead baby sparrows.

13:49.762 --> 13:52.432
Four little pink ones,
about yay big.

13:52.499 --> 13:55.168
Do me a favor.
Please tell your...

13:55.235 --> 13:57.704
...boring work stories at this
dinner we're going to.

13:57.770 --> 14:00.440
BOTH: That way, they'll never
want to see us again.

14:06.679 --> 14:08.781
I don't like you using
these too often.

14:08.848 --> 14:11.051
The specialness wears
off and she won't get
as excited about it.

14:11.118 --> 14:13.053
Do it! This dinner is
very important to me,

14:13.120 --> 14:14.054
and I need to
keep her busy.

14:14.121 --> 14:16.990
What's Burt got?

14:17.057 --> 14:18.691
What's he got?

14:18.758 --> 14:20.393
Saltwater taffy!
(gasps)

14:20.460 --> 14:21.628
Oh, oh, oh!

14:21.694 --> 14:23.730
Taffy! Taffy!
Ooh, taffy!

14:23.796 --> 14:26.299
Ooh! Ooh!

14:26.366 --> 14:28.468
Okay, Maw Maw,
go get it!

14:28.535 --> 14:29.602
Get that taffy, Maw Maw.

14:29.669 --> 14:31.238
Get it!

14:31.304 --> 14:33.373
She gets pretty excited
when she finds it.

14:33.440 --> 14:36.509
We'd better put
some newspapers down.
(grunting)

14:36.576 --> 14:38.111
Oh, oh!

14:40.280 --> 14:43.883
God, I hope Sylvia doesn't
recognize her old wine bottles.

14:43.951 --> 14:45.185
(doorbell rings)

14:45.252 --> 14:46.954
JIMMY:
They're here.

14:51.758 --> 14:54.161
Oh, come on.
Even if you're not looking

14:54.227 --> 14:56.596
forward to it, you
can at least fake it.
You know, put a big,

14:56.663 --> 15:00.600
fake smile on your face and act
like you're happy to be here.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.537
We're so happy to be here!

15:10.577 --> 15:12.112
Love the wine.

15:12.179 --> 15:14.948
It's our favorite.
It's hard to get.

15:15.015 --> 15:17.150
I have a secret place.

15:17.217 --> 15:19.419
What year is this?

15:19.486 --> 15:21.088
2011.

15:21.154 --> 15:24.657
That fancy watch doesn't
have the date, huh?

15:26.994 --> 15:29.196
Hey, Jimmy, I think

15:29.262 --> 15:31.564
there's something wrong
with my fuel line.

15:31.631 --> 15:32.899
Is your Maw Maw lucid?

15:32.966 --> 15:34.867
Unfortunately, she's
batcrap normal right now.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.203
Oh.

15:36.269 --> 15:37.670
Oh, and Sabrina...

15:37.737 --> 15:39.239
this is Justin.

15:39.306 --> 15:40.807
Justin, Sabrina.
Hey.

15:40.873 --> 15:42.375
Hey.

15:42.442 --> 15:45.278
Look at you two hanging out.
Like two penises in a pod.

15:45.345 --> 15:47.280
Very funny, Sabrina.
You know, not everything

15:47.347 --> 15:49.549
has to be a joke, which is why
I'm simply going to go

15:49.616 --> 15:52.485
in the house and get you an
Allen wrench to fix your moped.

15:55.355 --> 15:58.125
Oh, my God!
Me, too!

15:58.191 --> 16:00.127
I got pregnant
my sophomore year,

16:00.193 --> 16:01.995
and all the other
kids freaked out!

16:02.062 --> 16:05.465
VIRGINIA:
Yeah, I know. All the kids in
chemistry class could dissect

16:05.532 --> 16:08.268
a pig fetus no problem,
but you change one diaper

16:08.335 --> 16:10.403
on a lab table and
everyone's disgusted.

16:10.470 --> 16:11.438
(laughing)

16:11.504 --> 16:13.106
DONOVAN: Oh, man, that
was a wild year.

16:13.173 --> 16:15.908
Jimmy was a prom baby.
Justin?

16:15.975 --> 16:17.177
Homecoming.

16:23.550 --> 16:26.519
Yeah, I guess it was a bad
move to skip health class

16:26.586 --> 16:28.355
the day they showed you how to
put a condom on a banana.

16:28.421 --> 16:29.189
(laughter)

16:29.256 --> 16:31.024
Don't beat yourself up.

16:31.091 --> 16:33.626
I put a condom on a banana when
we had sex;

16:33.693 --> 16:34.494
she still got pregnant.

16:34.561 --> 16:37.264
And it made the banana
taste terrible.

16:38.831 --> 16:41.201
SYLVIA: Well, you know what?
Here's to us.

16:41.268 --> 16:44.437
Donovan and Burt both started
their own businesses,

16:44.504 --> 16:46.739
and we all worked very hard,
and now we're

16:46.806 --> 16:48.741
all young enough to enjoy our
grandchildren.

16:50.877 --> 16:52.345
VIRGINIA:
Cheers.

16:52.412 --> 16:54.947
Hey, what's up with,
uh, you and Moped Girl?

16:55.014 --> 16:56.949
Are you hitting that?

16:57.016 --> 16:59.752
Well, you know...
no.

16:59.819 --> 17:03.056
Uh, she's got this boyfriend
that's hardly ever around.

17:03.123 --> 17:04.924
I'd like to make a move,

17:04.991 --> 17:07.094
but if she says no, I'll
probably lose her as a friend.

17:07.160 --> 17:08.661
I got this.

17:08.728 --> 17:10.297
Look, this is what's
gonna happen.

17:10.363 --> 17:12.031
I'm gonna ask her out
on a date with me.

17:12.099 --> 17:13.800
Well, uh...

17:13.866 --> 17:16.303
But listen. If she's willing to
step out on her man for me,

17:16.369 --> 17:18.105
then you know there's some
wiggle room.

17:18.171 --> 17:20.039
I'm not interested.

17:20.107 --> 17:21.474
This is a test.

17:21.541 --> 17:23.543
Once we find out the answer,
you can move right in.

17:23.610 --> 17:26.979
You are smarter
and cooler than me,

17:27.046 --> 17:29.516
so, I'm going to assume

17:29.582 --> 17:31.518
that what you just said
makes perfect sense.

17:31.584 --> 17:33.520
Cool.

17:34.687 --> 17:35.788
(whispers): Jimmy!

17:39.226 --> 17:40.960
As soon as this
casserole's done,

17:41.027 --> 17:42.695
we're gonna feed
these people,

17:42.762 --> 17:44.431
and then you've got to get them
the hell outta here.

17:44.497 --> 17:45.698
Wh-What are you
talking about?

17:45.765 --> 17:47.234
It sounds like
you're having a blast.

17:47.300 --> 17:49.902
You have so much in common.
Too much in common.

17:49.969 --> 17:52.505
They were in the same situation
we were, but they did

17:52.572 --> 17:54.874
everything right and made
something of themselves.

17:54.941 --> 17:56.276
He owns a chain
of car washes.

17:56.343 --> 17:58.145
I still rent to own
my leaf blower.

17:58.211 --> 17:59.246
It's so perfect, it's

17:59.312 --> 18:01.581
humiliating hanging out
with them.

18:01.648 --> 18:04.083
It's like they're
Ken and Barbie

18:04.151 --> 18:06.819
and we're... the Potato Heads.

18:06.886 --> 18:08.721
Oh, come on!

18:08.788 --> 18:10.022
Oh, bad news, bro.

18:10.089 --> 18:11.391
She shot me down.

18:11.458 --> 18:13.826
This college boy got a serious
spell on this chick.

18:13.893 --> 18:15.662
Crap.
Well, I knew it.

18:15.728 --> 18:17.430
Thanks for trying.

18:18.798 --> 18:21.100
Here you go, Jimmy.
My moped's working again,

18:21.168 --> 18:24.804
but I'm beginning to rethink my
choice of ironic transportation.

18:24.871 --> 18:26.839
Oh, text me which
movie for Friday.

18:26.906 --> 18:28.241
I'll see anything that doesn't
have Matthew McConaughey in it.

18:28.308 --> 18:29.842
All right.

18:31.144 --> 18:32.745
Wh-What was that about?

18:32.812 --> 18:34.581
Oh, we're going
to the movies.

18:34.647 --> 18:36.849
But I thought
she shot you down.

18:36.916 --> 18:38.685
She did, but I told her
we could hang out

18:38.751 --> 18:40.287
as friends, and she
was cool with it.

18:40.353 --> 18:41.454
You know, she
has a boyfriend,

18:41.521 --> 18:43.356
so I might as well be
on the on-deck position.

18:43.423 --> 18:45.158
But this wasn't the plan.

18:45.225 --> 18:46.859
You're not going to the movies
with her.

18:46.926 --> 18:49.128
You're not on deck.
I'm on deck.

18:49.196 --> 18:50.997
I'm sorry, man.
I like her.

18:51.063 --> 18:52.865
I'm gonna stick around
and see what happens.

18:52.932 --> 18:55.001
You can't call dibs on a girl
that isn't yours.

18:55.067 --> 18:58.805
I'm not calling dibs;
I'm calling on deck.

18:58.871 --> 18:59.972
You can't call that.

19:00.039 --> 19:02.909
I already did.

19:02.975 --> 19:04.777
You can't.

19:04.844 --> 19:06.946
I can.

19:07.013 --> 19:08.681
And I did.

19:10.650 --> 19:13.220
Well, I'm just glad Justin's
made a new friend.

19:13.286 --> 19:14.921
It's hard at that age.

19:14.987 --> 19:16.756
(yelling)

19:16.823 --> 19:19.359
(groaning)

19:19.426 --> 19:21.328
VIRGINIA: (screams)
What in the...?!

19:26.366 --> 19:29.135
I'll call you on Friday
from the movies!
Oh, yeah? Well, I'll find out

19:29.202 --> 19:31.638
what theater you're at, sit
behind you and kick your seat!

19:31.704 --> 19:34.006
Fine, and Sabrina will
think you're a creep!

19:34.073 --> 19:35.542
Well, I'll wear a mask!

19:35.608 --> 19:38.077
All right, we'll be in the car.
Very nice meeting you all.

19:38.144 --> 19:39.879
Yeah.
And Burt, the Website I was

19:39.946 --> 19:41.581
talking about is
PainFreeTweezers.com.

19:41.648 --> 19:42.915
Oh, thank you.

19:42.982 --> 19:44.951
Take care!

19:45.017 --> 19:47.887
So... here's your pie.

19:47.954 --> 19:49.322
(sighs)

19:49.389 --> 19:51.023
If the plate's too
tough to clean,

19:51.090 --> 19:53.626
just let it soak and I'll
scrape it on Thursday.

19:53.693 --> 19:57.330
(sighs) I'm really sorry about
this, but you know how boys are.

19:57.397 --> 19:58.998
They find a pretty girl

19:59.065 --> 20:01.067
and they'll step on whoever they
have to to get her, you know?

20:01.133 --> 20:03.102
Actually, I don't know.

20:03.169 --> 20:05.938
I don't think Jimmy's ever been
in a scrape over a girl before.

20:06.005 --> 20:10.710
Usually, if a friend
likes somebody he just
stays away, you know?

20:10.777 --> 20:13.646
Really?
Wow.

20:13.713 --> 20:16.849
Sounds like you raised a really
good kid. I'm jealous.

20:16.916 --> 20:18.718
You must know something
we don't.

20:18.785 --> 20:20.653
Again, I am sorry.

20:20.720 --> 20:24.223
Especially after you spent
over $2,000 on wine.

20:24.291 --> 20:25.758
(laughs)

20:29.228 --> 20:31.864
You're not perfect.

20:31.931 --> 20:33.833
Excuse me?

20:35.067 --> 20:37.404
I'm telling you,
it's not working.

20:37.470 --> 20:39.606
Just give it a try.

20:39.672 --> 20:42.909
Works wonders for your mother.

20:42.975 --> 20:45.111
They're not perfect.

20:45.177 --> 20:46.413
What?

20:46.479 --> 20:49.115
They raised a jerk;
she told me.

20:49.181 --> 20:50.750
Not only does he
steal girls,

20:50.817 --> 20:52.719
but he also went
through a phase

20:52.785 --> 20:55.622
where he grew one of those
beards without a mustache.

20:55.688 --> 20:56.889
Gross!

20:56.956 --> 20:58.725
We raised a good kid.

20:58.791 --> 21:01.361
We're better than them
at something.

21:01.428 --> 21:03.029
That is fantastic!

21:03.095 --> 21:05.432
Isn't it? We're going to their
house next week for a barbecue.

21:05.498 --> 21:07.600
What? But their son's

21:07.667 --> 21:09.569
a jerk who's trying to
steal Sabrina away from me.

21:09.636 --> 21:11.137
I know.
Isn't it great?

21:11.203 --> 21:13.373
Burt, we've got friends.

21:13.440 --> 21:14.941
(whispers): We've got friends.

21:15.007 --> 21:17.344
Why do you people
keep giving me taffy?

21:17.410 --> 21:18.911
I'm 84 years old.

21:18.978 --> 21:22.181
Took me half an hour
to pull my dentures apart.

21:22.248 --> 21:27.620
Come, Maw Maw, let's go get your
tools for my phone jack.

21:27.687 --> 21:30.289
Not until she fixes
the sewing machine.

21:31.391 --> 21:33.793
I've got a friend!

21:35.127 --> 21:37.397
KID:
Hilarious.
