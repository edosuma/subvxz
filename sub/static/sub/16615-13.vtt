00:00.209 --> 00:02.455
Previously on "Once Upon a Time"...

00:02.461 --> 00:03.937
- You're up.
- Regina, what were you thinking?

00:03.961 --> 00:05.122
How could you bring him here?

00:06.431 --> 00:10.450
He wanted a fresh start, and
I'm just trying to help him.

00:10.677 --> 00:11.710
I know when you're lying.

00:12.012 --> 00:13.444
What are you hiding from me?

00:17.309 --> 00:21.478
When I kill Emma Swan, I
will finally become a hero.

00:21.484 --> 00:24.319
Defeating the Savior won't
be as easy as you think.

00:48.607 --> 00:50.674
Come on, move that wagon!

00:55.081 --> 01:00.017
On my word... charge!

01:08.394 --> 01:09.727
I-I can't.

01:11.864 --> 01:13.964
Where do you think you're going?

01:15.534 --> 01:17.434
The Ogres... they'll kill us.

01:17.536 --> 01:20.070
We're the only things standing
between those monsters and home.

01:20.139 --> 01:22.406
If we run, they'll kill everyone.

01:23.843 --> 01:26.844
How can we possibly win?

01:26.946 --> 01:29.246
This blade... it's called Hrunting.

01:29.348 --> 01:31.381
It was enchanted with light magic

01:31.484 --> 01:33.817
to ensure that whoever
carries it into battle

01:33.953 --> 01:36.787
will be hailed a hero.

01:36.889 --> 01:39.623
So, you can either be
remembered as a hero

01:39.725 --> 01:41.859
or forever known as the coward

01:41.927 --> 01:43.927
who ran on the eve of victory.

01:45.331 --> 01:47.231
All right, Beowulf.

01:48.901 --> 01:50.768
I'll fight.

01:53.205 --> 01:54.805
To victory!

02:20.866 --> 02:22.666
Aaah!

02:53.432 --> 02:56.266
Aah! Aaaah!

03:20.693 --> 03:22.826
Do your worst!

04:02.633 --> 04:05.068
Y-You killed him.

04:17.916 --> 04:20.918
I killed all of them.

04:41.707 --> 04:44.741
It's a little early for rum, isn't it?

04:44.843 --> 04:46.443
I called your office.

04:46.545 --> 04:47.711
You didn't have an opening.

04:47.813 --> 04:49.579
The bottle did.

04:49.682 --> 04:51.842
I take it you asked David
for permission to marry Emma?

04:52.851 --> 04:53.550
Aye.

04:53.652 --> 04:55.852
And what, he said "no"?

04:55.955 --> 04:57.888
Quite the opposite, actually.

04:57.990 --> 04:59.856
He gave me his blessing,
patted me on the back,

04:59.959 --> 05:01.625
practically called me "son."

05:04.171 --> 05:06.271
Well, so, what's problem?

05:06.480 --> 05:07.776
Cold feet? 'Cause, I
mean, that's perfect...

05:07.800 --> 05:11.001
Captain Hook doesn't get cold feet.

05:11.103 --> 05:12.436
No.

05:14.506 --> 05:17.774
I've since learned
something about my past...

05:17.843 --> 05:20.277
something Emma will never understand.

05:20.346 --> 05:23.513
There's not another living soul
who knows this secret but me.

05:23.615 --> 05:25.749
I could take it to my grave.

05:25.851 --> 05:27.818
So, why don't you?

05:27.920 --> 05:31.154
Because it would seem that I am broken.

05:35.427 --> 05:39.563
I actually want to tell Emma the truth.

05:39.665 --> 05:43.266
Now, tell me, Cricket, why is that?

05:43.335 --> 05:45.335
Well, maybe because
you really are the man

05:45.437 --> 05:48.472
that Emma wants to marry.

05:48.574 --> 05:51.641
If I tell Emma what I did,

05:51.744 --> 05:53.443
she's not gonna want to marry me.

05:53.545 --> 05:55.645
Yeah, but the fact that
you want to tell her,

05:55.748 --> 06:01.051
even though you don't need
to, means that you've changed.

06:01.153 --> 06:03.286
Do you think Emma will see it that way?

06:03.355 --> 06:06.189
I think maybe you need to find out.

06:13.332 --> 06:16.066
Gideon!

06:16.168 --> 06:17.868
Gideon!

06:20.906 --> 06:21.838
Belle.

06:21.907 --> 06:22.951
Did you find any sign of him?

06:22.975 --> 06:24.041
- No.
- There was nothing

06:24.109 --> 06:25.208
in the North Woods, either.

06:25.277 --> 06:27.277
Why am I not surprised
you couldn't find him?

06:27.346 --> 06:29.024
Could it be because you
were the one who lost him

06:29.048 --> 06:30.213
in the first place?

06:30.315 --> 06:32.127
If you're looking for a fairy
to take your anger out on,

06:32.151 --> 06:33.591
perhaps you should find your mother.

06:33.619 --> 06:36.119
Well, since the Black Fairy
is trapped in another realm,

06:36.188 --> 06:38.088
I suppose I'll have to make do with you.

06:38.157 --> 06:41.109
The most important thing
right now is finding our son.

06:41.477 --> 06:43.677
I think maybe it's best if
I continue to look on my own.

06:44.397 --> 06:45.281
I'm beginning to think

06:45.287 --> 06:47.072
we're not gonna find him out here.

06:47.141 --> 06:48.856
Well, why? Where...
Where do you think he is?

06:48.862 --> 06:51.543
His heart is set on
fulfilling his destiny.

06:51.645 --> 06:53.378
And he can't do that without the sword.

06:53.480 --> 06:54.579
What sword?

06:54.648 --> 06:57.074
The sword Emma shattered
when he last faced her.

06:57.780 --> 06:58.717
I don't understand.

06:58.786 --> 07:00.654
Why does he think
that... that killing Emma

07:00.660 --> 07:02.260
with this blade will
make him the Savior?

07:02.322 --> 07:04.322
He's not the first one to
think wielding that sword

07:04.425 --> 07:06.191
would make him a hero.

07:06.260 --> 07:08.727
We have to find him before
he gets his hands on it,

07:08.762 --> 07:10.529
before he goes after Emma again.

07:10.631 --> 07:11.563
We will.

07:11.632 --> 07:13.165
You can trust me, Belle.

07:13.785 --> 07:15.700
I've already lost one son.

07:15.736 --> 07:17.627
I won't lose another.

07:23.410 --> 07:26.269
To Rumplestiltskin,
hero of The Ogres War!

07:32.945 --> 07:35.278
Is it true, Papa?

07:35.347 --> 07:37.013
You really defeated the ogres?

07:37.082 --> 07:39.349
Aye, Baelfire, it is.

07:39.451 --> 07:41.685
I told you this dagger
would change our lives.

07:41.787 --> 07:43.353
Now no one else has to die.

07:44.723 --> 07:48.358
Why are you cheering that monster?

07:50.028 --> 07:52.362
Beowulf.

07:52.464 --> 07:55.565
You lost this at the front.

08:00.339 --> 08:03.206
Rumplestiltskin...

08:03.308 --> 08:04.941
Oh, you've changed

08:05.043 --> 08:08.211
since you hobbled
yourself to escape the war.

08:08.606 --> 08:11.848
How did a coward who ran from the war

08:11.950 --> 08:15.719
manage to defeat an
entire army of ogres?

08:15.787 --> 08:18.088
I had something worth fighting for.

08:18.190 --> 08:19.556
I know how.

08:19.658 --> 08:21.258
You became the Dark One.

08:23.495 --> 08:26.863
Dark magic comes with a price.

08:26.932 --> 08:31.168
We'll pay dearly for this... all of us.

08:35.039 --> 08:38.107
Papa.

08:38.177 --> 08:39.609
Don't listen to him, Bae.

08:39.711 --> 08:41.211
He's just jealous.

08:41.313 --> 08:44.014
Maybe, Papa, but he's right about magic.

08:44.082 --> 08:45.448
The war's over.

08:45.551 --> 08:48.485
You don't need it anymore.

08:48.554 --> 08:50.620
I can't just give it up, Bae.

08:50.689 --> 08:51.955
It's part of me now.

08:52.024 --> 08:53.290
That's not true.

08:53.358 --> 08:55.659
Beneath those scales,
you're still my papa.

08:55.727 --> 08:58.094
You don't need the dagger anymore.

09:03.135 --> 09:04.701
All right, son.

09:04.803 --> 09:06.937
No more magic.

09:07.005 --> 09:08.972
Let's go home.

09:46.030 --> 09:47.697
- Father.
- Gideon.

09:47.726 --> 09:49.440
After your little
showdown with the Savior,

09:49.446 --> 09:51.251
this is the last place you should be.

09:51.257 --> 09:52.423
Don't worry, Father.

09:52.429 --> 09:56.373
With this, she won't be able
to get the best of me again.

09:59.795 --> 10:01.466
Perhaps she won't.

10:01.472 --> 10:02.544
But there's still a few things

10:02.550 --> 10:04.717
you need to learn from your papa.

10:18.977 --> 10:21.244
Not another step!

10:22.414 --> 10:25.048
How did you find me?

10:25.117 --> 10:26.216
Believe it or not,

10:26.318 --> 10:28.618
this is where the other
Robin used to come to think.

10:28.687 --> 10:30.854
I thought we already
established I'm not that man.

10:30.922 --> 10:34.224
Yes, I-I know, which is why I'm here.

10:34.293 --> 10:37.794
I-I came to apologize.

10:37.863 --> 10:39.529
I-I might have put pressure on you

10:39.631 --> 10:41.359
to be someone you're not.

10:43.168 --> 10:44.434
I'm sorry.

10:45.971 --> 10:48.605
I just, uh...

10:48.674 --> 10:50.440
I-I think it's taking
me a little longer

10:50.509 --> 10:53.009
to get used to this
world than I imagined.

10:53.078 --> 10:54.377
Well, let me help you. I...

10:54.446 --> 10:57.547
No. Regina, really,
that's not necessary.

10:57.616 --> 10:59.316
Says the man who's hiding in the woods,

10:59.384 --> 11:03.853
pointing a bow and arrow
at everything that moves.

11:03.922 --> 11:06.523
Well, when you put it like that...

11:06.591 --> 11:09.959
Why don't I meet you
at your manse tonight?

11:10.028 --> 11:13.563
Just give me some time to clear my head.

11:32.818 --> 11:36.353
I'm afraid I couldn't take any chances.

11:36.455 --> 11:37.587
You said you'd help me.

11:37.689 --> 11:39.122
You said you were on my side.

11:39.191 --> 11:41.424
I did, and I am.

11:41.493 --> 11:44.961
But killing the Savior, even
to destroy the Black Fairy,

11:45.030 --> 11:47.731
you will never become
the hero you want to be.

11:49.935 --> 11:52.702
Gideon...

11:52.738 --> 11:54.604
do you know why I became the Dark One?

11:54.706 --> 11:55.939
Afraid not.

11:56.041 --> 11:59.342
I took the power to
end The First Ogres War,

11:59.411 --> 12:01.978
to save my first son.

12:02.047 --> 12:05.248
I embraced darkness for good.

12:05.317 --> 12:07.684
But I never became a hero.

12:07.753 --> 12:10.387
Because once you give in to darkness,

12:10.489 --> 12:13.123
it's almost impossible
to resist its call.

12:13.191 --> 12:15.091
Not if I become the Savior,

12:15.127 --> 12:16.926
not if I steal Emma's light magic.

12:17.028 --> 12:19.796
And how are you gonna do that?

12:19.865 --> 12:22.599
This is a useless relic, Gideon.

12:22.667 --> 12:24.234
It never worked to begin with.

12:24.302 --> 12:25.802
You know, I thought you'd want to see

12:25.871 --> 12:27.637
the fall of the Black
Fairy more than anyone.

12:27.739 --> 12:30.106
Oh, I do...

12:30.208 --> 12:33.243
but not if it costs my son his soul.

12:37.182 --> 12:39.149
I have to defeat her.

12:39.184 --> 12:41.985
I have to save my people from her curse.

12:42.053 --> 12:46.990
Gideon, no one knows more
about darkness than I.

12:47.092 --> 12:48.858
If you do this,

12:48.894 --> 12:54.197
giving into darkness can
only lead to heartbreak.

13:05.143 --> 13:06.375
Bae?

13:12.851 --> 13:14.951
What happened?

13:15.053 --> 13:16.352
Who did this to you?

13:16.421 --> 13:19.022
You can tell me.

13:19.124 --> 13:20.349
The baker's son.

13:20.355 --> 13:22.232
Well, why did he do that?

13:23.795 --> 13:26.677
So... So I'd look like a monster.

13:28.433 --> 13:30.500
Just like me.

13:30.535 --> 13:33.102
I think it's about time I
had a word with his father.

13:33.171 --> 13:35.638
No, Papa, you'll only make things worse.

13:38.009 --> 13:39.709
- Rumplestiltskin.
- What?!

13:39.778 --> 13:41.277
There's a creature called a Grendel.

13:41.379 --> 13:42.612
He raided our village,

13:42.618 --> 13:44.718
carried our family and
friends off into the darkness.

13:44.816 --> 13:47.217
I'm afraid my
monster-slaying days are over.

13:47.285 --> 13:49.686
I made a promise to my son,
and I intend to keep it.

13:49.788 --> 13:51.616
We sent Beowulf after
the beast days ago,

13:51.622 --> 13:53.062
but we haven't heard from him since.

13:53.124 --> 13:55.692
Papa, you can help them.

13:55.794 --> 13:58.328
But I won't break my promise, son.

13:58.430 --> 13:59.729
I won't use dark magic.

13:59.831 --> 14:01.097
You don't have to.

14:01.166 --> 14:02.926
You can save those
people without your magic.

14:02.968 --> 14:04.434
No.

14:04.536 --> 14:06.603
- I-I can't.
- You can.

14:06.609 --> 14:09.297
And it'll be a chance to show
everyone in the village the truth...

14:09.303 --> 14:11.036
that you're not a slave to that dagger.

14:11.432 --> 14:13.543
You think that'll make
things better for us?

14:13.645 --> 14:15.338
I know it will, Papa.

14:18.850 --> 14:21.518
This little Munchkin
went to see the Wizard,

14:21.620 --> 14:25.388
and this little Munchkin stayed at home.

14:26.658 --> 14:27.991
And this little Munchkin

14:27.997 --> 14:29.997
never lived to see
the light of day again.

14:30.195 --> 14:32.128
Careful. I don't think your sister

14:32.230 --> 14:33.407
would be too pleased if you caused

14:33.431 --> 14:35.832
the demise of a second Robin.

14:35.934 --> 14:37.033
I don't care.

14:37.102 --> 14:38.868
You're not getting my daughter!

14:38.937 --> 14:40.603
Oh, I'm not here for the brat.

14:40.705 --> 14:42.171
I never was one for children.

14:42.240 --> 14:44.707
You see, back where I'm from,

14:44.776 --> 14:47.043
I robbed enough witches
and warlocks to know

14:47.112 --> 14:50.213
the kind of magic you need
to break a protection spell.

14:50.315 --> 14:52.982
Problem is, I had a
partner that was savvy

14:53.084 --> 14:54.784
with that kind of stuff.

14:54.853 --> 14:58.855
Sorry. Grand theft
sorcery isn't my thing.

14:58.924 --> 15:01.424
Oh, I don't need your
help to break in somewhere.

15:01.526 --> 15:04.060
I need it to break out.

15:04.162 --> 15:05.395
Oh.

15:05.463 --> 15:06.796
Do you want to leave Storybrooke?

15:06.898 --> 15:08.676
It's just that there's this
pesky little protection spell

15:08.700 --> 15:09.966
surrounding the town.

15:10.068 --> 15:12.969
I came here for a fresh
start... new people to rob,

15:13.038 --> 15:15.772
places to drink, women to meet.

15:15.840 --> 15:18.274
But, you see, I'm not
gonna get any of that,

15:18.376 --> 15:21.678
not with your sister threatening
to reform me at every step.

15:21.780 --> 15:24.547
Believe me, that I understand.

15:24.616 --> 15:26.516
But why should I help you?

15:26.618 --> 15:29.886
Because you need to leave
this town more than I do.

15:29.955 --> 15:32.355
I know when somebody's
got a target on their back.

15:32.457 --> 15:34.891
I may have a few enemies.

15:34.897 --> 15:37.297
Well, isn't it time
to make a few friends?

15:38.997 --> 15:40.830
When do we leave?

15:45.278 --> 15:46.898
You think tea with dear old Dad

15:46.904 --> 15:48.837
is gonna make everything better?

15:49.282 --> 15:51.082
No.

15:51.117 --> 15:53.017
But a chat might.

15:53.053 --> 15:54.886
I want to know what the
Black Fairy did to you

15:54.988 --> 15:56.554
to make you think killing the Savior

15:56.656 --> 15:58.723
is the only way to become a hero.

16:02.829 --> 16:04.329
How can I trust you with the truth

16:04.397 --> 16:06.464
when you don't even trust me?

16:10.503 --> 16:11.869
Mm.

16:23.883 --> 16:25.583
This way, Papa.

16:25.685 --> 16:27.819
Grendel must be in the
caves beyond the lake.

16:28.989 --> 16:30.621
We'll never find the entrance.

16:30.690 --> 16:31.923
Yes, we can.

16:32.025 --> 16:33.091
The water's not deep.

16:33.193 --> 16:36.127
We can wade through it.

16:41.301 --> 16:43.134
What is it?

16:45.505 --> 16:46.904
You brought the dagger?

16:46.973 --> 16:48.573
I couldn't leave it behind.

16:48.641 --> 16:50.708
We could be in those caves
in the blink of an eye.

16:50.777 --> 16:54.579
But, Papa, that's not gonna
prove anything to anyone.

16:54.614 --> 16:58.449
I want to do this the
right way, Bae, but...

16:58.485 --> 17:00.151
I can't explain it.

17:00.253 --> 17:01.486
I can.

17:01.554 --> 17:04.288
It's just like when you
needed the crutch to walk.

17:04.391 --> 17:07.525
Yeah. Only worse.

17:07.627 --> 17:10.461
When I felt the power this gave me,

17:10.563 --> 17:12.997
I couldn't imagine living without it.

17:13.032 --> 17:15.098
Remember when an ember
jumped from the stove

17:15.167 --> 17:17.035
and caught your store of wool on fire?

17:17.103 --> 17:19.337
You rushed across the
hovel to put it out...

17:19.406 --> 17:20.805
without your crutch.

17:20.874 --> 17:22.117
Well, that was a short distance.

17:22.142 --> 17:23.840
So is this.

17:23.877 --> 17:26.778
Think of it like
walking across the hovel,

17:26.846 --> 17:28.913
one step at a time.

17:34.921 --> 17:38.022
There's only one way I'm
gonna be able to do this.

17:40.093 --> 17:41.959
But, Papa, this can control you.

17:42.062 --> 17:43.261
Exactly, Bae.

17:43.363 --> 17:46.764
If you see me go to use
its dark power, you stop me.

17:53.907 --> 17:55.940
"Her Handsome Hero."

17:56.042 --> 17:58.142
Your mother's favorite.

17:58.211 --> 18:00.244
She sent me away with that copy.

18:00.313 --> 18:02.146
Years after the Black
Fairy kidnapped me,

18:02.248 --> 18:03.681
I found it amongst her things.

18:03.716 --> 18:06.317
I kept it beneath the
mattress in my cell.

18:06.419 --> 18:10.955
That tale got me through
the endless nights.

18:11.024 --> 18:12.957
But then one night,

18:13.059 --> 18:15.455
the Black Fairy caught me reading it.

18:17.330 --> 18:18.641
She asked me if I wanted to be like

18:18.665 --> 18:21.833
the character I was
named after... a hero.

18:21.935 --> 18:23.734
I said I did.

18:23.837 --> 18:27.238
She just laughed, and she
said, "We'll see about that."

18:28.348 --> 18:31.371
That night, she took the boy
in the cell across from mine.

18:32.835 --> 18:35.754
She dragged him to her
tower, where she whipped him.

18:37.684 --> 18:40.084
I could hear his cries
echo through the halls,

18:40.153 --> 18:42.954
begging for someone to stop her.

18:43.022 --> 18:46.023
I reached out to the door
of my cell, and it was open.

18:46.059 --> 18:47.525
I had a chance to save him.

18:47.627 --> 18:50.094
But I didn't. I just...
I just sat there,

18:50.196 --> 18:52.196
listening to his cries.

18:54.100 --> 18:57.468
She left the door unlocked on purpose.

19:02.008 --> 19:04.842
To show me I didn't have what it takes.

19:04.911 --> 19:09.213
I was a coward, Father, just like you.

19:09.315 --> 19:10.515
But we can show your mother

19:10.550 --> 19:13.484
that she was wrong about both of us.

19:13.586 --> 19:16.020
Will you help me?

19:16.122 --> 19:19.190
Yes.

19:19.259 --> 19:23.895
But first you must settle your nerves.

19:37.277 --> 19:39.610
What kind of tea is this?

19:39.679 --> 19:42.747
One laced with memory potion.

19:44.584 --> 19:47.852
In a few moments...

19:47.954 --> 19:51.489
you won't remember what
the Black Fairy did.

19:51.591 --> 19:54.630
Your pain will be gone.

20:02.969 --> 20:06.604
Did you really think a memory
potion would work on me?

20:06.706 --> 20:09.540
I was raised by the Black Fairy.

20:12.679 --> 20:14.245
Gideon, don't.

20:14.347 --> 20:16.581
You know, I thought you cared
about what she did to me,

20:16.683 --> 20:18.549
but you're no different than her.

20:18.651 --> 20:21.352
Now you're going to keep your promise,

20:21.454 --> 20:23.721
and you are going to help
me to fulfill my destiny,

20:23.790 --> 20:25.344
whether you want to or not.

20:44.686 --> 20:46.018
Grendel.

21:01.635 --> 21:03.463
We're too late.

21:35.469 --> 21:37.903
An ogre's call?

21:37.972 --> 21:39.972
Papa, what is it?

21:40.074 --> 21:41.573
Are you all right?

21:43.310 --> 21:44.413
Papa!

21:44.419 --> 21:46.952
Stay away from my son!

21:47.014 --> 21:48.748
Or what?

21:48.816 --> 21:51.998
Don't. We should be
fighting Grendel together.

21:52.407 --> 21:55.275
There is no Grendel, Bae.

21:55.356 --> 21:57.056
There never has been.

21:57.091 --> 21:58.524
Your father's right.

21:58.593 --> 22:02.461
The only monster down
here is the Dark One.

22:02.530 --> 22:05.398
You killed those villagers.

22:05.500 --> 22:06.966
I didn't.

22:07.068 --> 22:08.634
You did.

22:08.703 --> 22:09.935
Why are you doing this?

22:10.004 --> 22:13.773
So he can be the hero he
thinks he was meant to be.

22:13.875 --> 22:16.308
We would have won that war
without your dark magic!

22:16.377 --> 22:18.511
You would have died.
Everyone would have died!

22:18.546 --> 22:21.247
And doing this now
won't make you a hero.

22:21.315 --> 22:22.995
That's not what the
villagers are gonna say

22:23.084 --> 22:25.351
when they see you
standing over these bodies.

22:25.420 --> 22:29.321
Dark One, I command you...
stay exactly where you are.

22:29.390 --> 22:32.425
- No. Papa!
- Bae, run. Get help.

22:34.061 --> 22:35.861
Think your boy can stop me?

22:35.963 --> 22:37.630
You may have ended The Ogres War,

22:37.698 --> 22:40.433
but I'll be remembered as the hero

22:40.535 --> 22:43.335
who defeated the Dark One.

22:49.744 --> 22:53.579
This book contains the
spell to repair the sword.

22:53.681 --> 22:54.747
Restoring its power

22:54.816 --> 22:56.682
is gonna be more
difficult than you think.

22:56.751 --> 23:01.153
It requires the blood of
the person who forged it.

23:02.457 --> 23:03.756
If that's what it takes, Father.

23:03.825 --> 23:06.459
Gideon, look, you were
willing to kill the Savior.

23:06.527 --> 23:08.038
Now you're willing to
spill innocent blood.

23:08.062 --> 23:09.128
I don't have a choice.

23:09.230 --> 23:11.697
I need to fix this sword
to fulfill my destiny.

23:11.766 --> 23:13.098
And what happens then?

23:13.167 --> 23:14.266
How does it end?

23:14.335 --> 23:15.720
With the destruction of the Black Fairy

23:15.726 --> 23:16.726
and all she stands for.

23:16.771 --> 23:18.604
That's not how it ends.

23:18.673 --> 23:20.605
That's not how it ever ends.

23:21.968 --> 23:25.044
The Black Fairy
destroyed your childhood.

23:25.112 --> 23:27.546
Don't let her destroy
the rest of your life.

23:29.851 --> 23:32.384
You don't get a say in the matter.

23:32.453 --> 23:36.055
Dark One, who forged this blade?

23:36.157 --> 23:38.123
Whose blood do I need?

23:41.395 --> 23:43.929
The Blue Fairy's.

23:48.636 --> 23:51.403
My Fairy Godmother?

23:53.040 --> 23:56.008
There's good in you, Gideon.

23:56.077 --> 23:58.444
Don't snuff out the light in your heart.

23:58.546 --> 24:01.013
If you do this...

24:01.082 --> 24:03.482
you might not be able to get back.

24:09.624 --> 24:11.090
That's a risk I have to take.

24:11.192 --> 24:12.192
Gideon, please.

24:12.226 --> 24:15.761
And I can't have you getting in my way.

24:15.830 --> 24:18.898
I truly am sorry, Father.

24:19.000 --> 24:23.869
Dark One, I command you...
don't try to stop me.

24:44.091 --> 24:45.190
Where have you been?

24:45.259 --> 24:47.092
Don't get your arrows in a twist.

24:47.194 --> 24:48.928
I just had to pick up a few things.

24:50.798 --> 24:52.565
Pet snake?

24:52.600 --> 24:54.199
Well, she's practically family.

24:54.268 --> 24:56.201
And with so many dank sewers out there,

24:56.270 --> 24:57.636
I could hardly leave her behind.

24:57.738 --> 25:00.606
Right. So, we're doing this.

25:00.675 --> 25:02.207
Mixed to order.

25:02.276 --> 25:04.743
It'll drain the magic out of any spell,

25:04.845 --> 25:05.978
including the town line.

25:06.080 --> 25:09.648
And then it's hello, New York City.

25:12.253 --> 25:14.753
I thought you might be here.

25:14.855 --> 25:16.522
I should have known you'd be with him.

25:16.591 --> 25:17.957
I know you're gonna miss me, sis,

25:18.059 --> 25:20.225
but I couldn't pass up
a ticket out of here.

25:20.294 --> 25:22.720
And Baby Robin needs her
mummy very much alive.

25:22.822 --> 25:25.322
Do you really think I wouldn't
notice my magic was missing?

25:25.391 --> 25:27.291
- I can explain.
- Oh, you mean lie to me again?

25:27.393 --> 25:28.659
You said you came here

25:28.728 --> 25:32.029
because you wanted to
find meaning in your life.

25:32.131 --> 25:33.305
Was any of that true?

25:33.374 --> 25:34.374
Yes!

25:34.467 --> 25:36.241
I truly wanted to find a purpose here,

25:36.344 --> 25:38.026
but you made it so hard.

25:38.032 --> 25:40.152
How did I make it hard? All
I did was try to help you.

25:40.214 --> 25:42.948
By bringing me somewhere
where I'm constantly reminded

25:43.017 --> 25:45.084
of somebody that I'm not.

25:47.188 --> 25:50.656
Regina, I can't live up to the legacy

25:50.758 --> 25:53.058
of a man who died for you.

25:58.933 --> 25:59.933
It won't work.

26:00.001 --> 26:01.767
Don't listen to her. She's lying.

26:01.869 --> 26:03.569
Fine. Don't believe me.

26:03.671 --> 26:05.671
Go ahead. Try it.

26:13.280 --> 26:14.380
What the devil?!

26:17.718 --> 26:20.586
If I had all the ingredients
to break the protection spell,

26:20.688 --> 26:22.199
do you really think I
wouldn't have done it already?

26:22.223 --> 26:23.389
So, we're trapped here?

26:23.491 --> 26:25.024
I bet you're happy now.

26:25.092 --> 26:26.692
Robin, I know you want to leave,

26:26.794 --> 26:29.995
but you don't understand
the world out there.

26:30.097 --> 26:32.498
It's not like where you're from.

26:32.566 --> 26:35.067
I can handle myself, Regina.

26:39.774 --> 26:42.107
I know.

26:44.045 --> 26:45.333
If you really want to leave,

26:45.339 --> 26:46.925
I'll dig through every book I have

26:46.931 --> 26:49.942
to figure out how to
break the protection spell.

26:50.918 --> 26:52.151
You will?

26:52.253 --> 26:53.635
Yes.

26:54.955 --> 26:56.367
I owe it to him...

26:58.092 --> 26:59.362
to you...

27:00.728 --> 27:03.395
to let you find your happiness...

27:06.567 --> 27:09.468
even if it means helping
you walk out of here.

27:29.356 --> 27:31.823
You're just like your father.

27:31.925 --> 27:33.992
You don't have it in you.

27:38.165 --> 27:39.764
Dark One, I summon thee!

27:39.866 --> 27:42.367
Ugh!

27:42.469 --> 27:45.704
I told you to stay away from my son.

27:49.242 --> 27:51.743
Go ahead. Kill me.

27:51.812 --> 27:54.145
Then your boy will see
that you are a monster.

28:03.757 --> 28:06.057
I'm taking you back to the village,

28:06.126 --> 28:08.960
and I'm telling them the truth.

28:08.996 --> 28:11.162
You think they'll believe you?

28:13.300 --> 28:15.233
They're afraid of you, Rumple.

28:15.302 --> 28:18.336
They watched you bring an
army of Ogres to their knees.

28:18.405 --> 28:19.676
They know it's only a matter of time

28:19.682 --> 28:22.649
before you turn that dagger on them.

28:22.909 --> 28:25.744
He's right, Papa.
They'll never believe us.

28:28.315 --> 28:30.415
Then we'll find a new village, Bae.

28:30.484 --> 28:33.318
We'll start over, you and me.

28:35.489 --> 28:36.988
No.

28:37.090 --> 28:40.058
I won't let him do this to us.

28:40.093 --> 28:43.561
He's the monster. He's
the one who should pay.

28:48.274 --> 28:50.274
Step aside, boy.

29:09.389 --> 29:12.957
Bae.

29:13.060 --> 29:14.225
Don't.

29:14.261 --> 29:16.995
Dark One, stop him!

29:18.165 --> 29:20.265
Bae, please...

29:20.333 --> 29:22.100
Do it! Kill him!

29:25.205 --> 29:27.639
Aaaah!

29:44.925 --> 29:47.092
Oh, Bae.

29:53.033 --> 29:55.202
You were my Fairy Godmother.

29:57.037 --> 29:58.803
Gideon.

29:58.872 --> 30:00.672
I have been looking for you everywhere.

30:00.740 --> 30:04.576
You were supposed to protect
me when I was just a baby.

30:04.678 --> 30:06.177
I know.

30:06.246 --> 30:07.412
I tried.

30:07.514 --> 30:11.516
But the Black Fairy...
she was too strong.

30:11.618 --> 30:12.650
I'm sorry.

30:12.752 --> 30:13.785
Don't be.

30:13.854 --> 30:15.565
You may not have been
able to help me back then,

30:15.589 --> 30:17.655
but maybe you can now.

30:20.327 --> 30:22.430
No. Killing Emma with that blade...

30:22.436 --> 30:24.820
it... it will not make you the Savior

30:24.898 --> 30:26.131
the way that you think.

30:26.166 --> 30:27.499
Save the lecture.

30:27.601 --> 30:30.368
There's only one thing
I need from you...

30:30.470 --> 30:33.738
your magic... all of it.

30:33.840 --> 30:34.906
Please don't do this.

30:34.975 --> 30:36.741
Don't make this any
harder than it has to be.

30:36.810 --> 30:38.977
Gideon...

30:43.917 --> 30:46.718
Gideon, stop.

30:49.923 --> 30:51.200
Father, what are you doing here?

30:51.224 --> 30:54.406
I watched one son darken
his heart long ago.

30:55.929 --> 30:57.795
I can't watch another do the same.

30:57.898 --> 30:59.664
You can't stop me. I command you.

30:59.766 --> 31:03.001
I'm not here to stop you.

31:03.103 --> 31:05.136
I'm here to do it for you.

31:06.940 --> 31:11.209
Gold, please don't.

31:11.311 --> 31:12.847
I'm sorry.

31:38.638 --> 31:40.905
We will defeat the Black Fairy.

31:41.007 --> 31:43.107
You will become a hero.

31:43.176 --> 31:47.579
But I won't let you touch
the darkness to do so.

31:47.681 --> 31:49.914
Thank you, Father.

31:56.223 --> 31:58.523
I don't think I'm going
to be needing this anymore.

32:12.305 --> 32:17.341
Bae... what are you going
to do with the dagger now?

32:17.443 --> 32:19.043
I don't know.

32:19.112 --> 32:20.571
But the baker's son will think twice

32:20.577 --> 32:23.278
about pushing me in the mud
when he sees me carrying this.

32:23.750 --> 32:25.149
Oh, Bae, listen to yourself.

32:25.218 --> 32:27.618
Papa, I'm sorry I asked
you to give up your power.

32:27.687 --> 32:30.021
I understand now why it's so hard.

32:30.056 --> 32:31.856
But we need it.

32:31.958 --> 32:35.092
It's the only way to protect ourselves.

32:39.232 --> 32:41.599
You're right, Bae.

32:41.668 --> 32:44.735
You're right.

32:44.837 --> 32:47.271
Now, here.

32:48.575 --> 32:50.942
Drink your tea.

32:57.617 --> 32:59.884
What's in this, Papa?

32:59.953 --> 33:02.687
It tastes strange.

33:07.360 --> 33:10.962
Memory potion.

33:11.030 --> 33:14.265
I won't let you follow
me into the darkness, Bae.

33:15.602 --> 33:19.070
One of us has to be strong.

33:19.706 --> 33:21.539
Wha...? Papa, Papa, where are we?

33:21.608 --> 33:23.975
How... How did we get out of the cave?

33:24.043 --> 33:25.810
You bumped your head.

33:25.845 --> 33:28.312
It must have been harder than I thought.

33:28.318 --> 33:29.584
Don't worry, son.

33:29.749 --> 33:33.884
Beowulf won't be bothering us anymore.

33:33.987 --> 33:35.553
What?

33:35.622 --> 33:37.855
What happened to him?

33:39.192 --> 33:41.392
It...

33:41.494 --> 33:43.494
It's not important.

33:52.038 --> 33:53.938
You killed him.

33:55.341 --> 33:57.508
Papa, how could you?

34:02.115 --> 34:05.516
I'm sorry, Bae.

34:05.585 --> 34:07.685
I did what I had to do.

34:10.889 --> 34:13.190
Beowulf was right.

34:13.259 --> 34:16.027
That dagger is turning
you into a monster.

34:30.411 --> 34:32.009
What happened?

34:32.110 --> 34:33.277
Belle, I can explain.

34:33.379 --> 34:34.311
No.

34:34.380 --> 34:35.793
Rumple, you promised me.

34:35.799 --> 34:37.237
You said you would find Gideon

34:37.243 --> 34:39.713
before he did something
he couldn't come back from.

34:39.719 --> 34:41.658
Gideon didn't do this to her.

34:42.822 --> 34:45.188
- I did.
- Why?

34:45.257 --> 34:49.659
Because it was the only way to
stop him from doing it himself.

34:49.728 --> 34:51.495
If he had...

34:51.597 --> 34:55.266
I fear he would already be lost to us.

34:55.333 --> 35:00.037
Once we stop him, I
can return her magic.

35:00.106 --> 35:03.040
No one needs to be hurt.

35:03.109 --> 35:05.476
Gideon has the sword now.

35:05.545 --> 35:07.611
It's more powerful than ever.

35:07.680 --> 35:11.382
He'll go after the Savior once again.

35:11.451 --> 35:12.691
I just hope there's enough time

35:12.752 --> 35:16.487
that we can stop him before he does.

35:16.589 --> 35:17.655
We will.

35:20.259 --> 35:23.994
For once, you put our son first.

35:24.063 --> 35:28.299
You darkened your soul
so he wouldn't have to.

35:28.367 --> 35:30.334
If you can make the right choice

35:30.403 --> 35:33.437
after all the wrong you've done,

35:33.506 --> 35:37.374
then that means that there's
hope our son will, too.

36:20.987 --> 36:23.988
Emma? Are you home?

36:27.121 --> 36:29.088
- There you are.
- Hey.

36:29.126 --> 36:30.757
Oh, wow. Captain Morgan.

36:30.763 --> 36:32.396
I thought we were switching to water.

36:32.498 --> 36:35.966
I'm afraid it wouldn't give
me the courage that I need.

36:36.068 --> 36:39.003
You see, there's something
I need to tell you.

36:43.109 --> 36:47.611
It's just, what I have
to say isn't exactly easy,

36:47.680 --> 36:51.615
and I'm not entirely sure
how you're gonna react.

36:51.717 --> 36:54.451
Well, maybe I can make it easier

36:54.487 --> 36:59.423
and tell you that my
answer would be yes.

36:59.492 --> 37:02.693
Yes? I...

37:02.795 --> 37:05.362
What was the question?

37:05.431 --> 37:06.997
I might have found something

37:07.099 --> 37:10.234
in your sea chest that I shouldn't have.

37:17.243 --> 37:19.013
Are you mad at me?

37:20.646 --> 37:23.447
No. How could I ever be mad at you?

37:26.886 --> 37:28.986
It's just you and me.

37:29.055 --> 37:32.623
No walls, no secrets.

37:37.321 --> 37:40.322
I know I ruined the surprise...

37:40.433 --> 37:42.366
but what do you say?

37:57.183 --> 37:59.683
Emma Swan...

38:03.522 --> 38:05.623
will you marry me?

38:09.829 --> 38:11.829
Yes, Killian.

38:11.898 --> 38:14.098
Yes.

38:37.823 --> 38:39.523
There you are.

38:39.529 --> 38:41.562
Here to steal some more of my magic?

38:41.727 --> 38:45.930
No. I'm here to return Queen Cobra

38:45.998 --> 38:49.500
before the Charmings
realize she's missing.

38:49.602 --> 38:53.837
And maybe to... apologize.

38:55.508 --> 38:57.516
I shouldn't have gone behind your back

38:57.585 --> 38:59.343
and helped Robin escape.

39:00.680 --> 39:03.113
No. This one's my fault.

39:03.215 --> 39:04.782
Your fault?

39:04.884 --> 39:07.284
Okay. Let's go with that, then.

39:09.755 --> 39:13.132
How did I ever think
that removing my evil half

39:13.200 --> 39:16.969
would change anything?

39:17.071 --> 39:19.605
When I saw Robin in
that alternate world,

39:19.707 --> 39:22.341
it was a test...

39:22.376 --> 39:25.644
to see if I could move
forward, and I failed.

39:31.786 --> 39:34.820
Well, I thought I was rid
of you for good, Queenie,

39:34.922 --> 39:37.423
but I guess I'll always
be paying the price

39:37.525 --> 39:41.260
for what you did...

39:41.362 --> 39:43.996
what I did.

39:50.604 --> 39:52.604
What?!

39:52.707 --> 39:55.074
Where the hell is she?

40:10.324 --> 40:12.658
Easy, there.

40:25.673 --> 40:28.207
Aah!

40:32.413 --> 40:35.748
Hope that didn't sting.

40:35.850 --> 40:38.298
A... A bit of that anti-magic potion

40:38.304 --> 40:39.653
stuck to you in the blast.

40:39.659 --> 40:42.454
And, well, as you can
see, I needed some.

40:42.556 --> 40:43.822
So, thanks.

40:43.924 --> 40:46.058
I just left you at the town line.

40:46.160 --> 40:48.560
You left Regina at the town line.

40:48.662 --> 40:49.828
You are Regina.

40:49.930 --> 40:52.364
I'm the Evil Queen.

40:52.466 --> 40:54.767
You, of all people, should
recognize a Doppelganger

40:54.869 --> 40:56.802
when you see one.

40:56.904 --> 40:58.537
There's two of us now.

40:58.639 --> 41:00.439
I don't care if there's
seven of you now.

41:00.541 --> 41:02.040
I'm leaving as soon as possible.

41:02.143 --> 41:04.476
Well, that's a shame...

41:04.545 --> 41:06.211
because there's nothing
for you out there.

41:06.313 --> 41:07.596
Nothing you can say

41:07.602 --> 41:09.435
will keep me in this abysmal hamlet

41:09.441 --> 41:11.112
a moment longer than I need to be.

41:11.118 --> 41:12.551
"Abysmal hamlet"?

41:13.921 --> 41:16.755
Sounds like you haven't
had the right tour guide.

41:17.091 --> 41:19.291
But now you do.

41:19.393 --> 41:22.394
And when I'm done with you,

41:22.496 --> 41:25.230
you'll have a whole new appreciation

41:25.332 --> 41:28.801
of what Storybrooke has to offer.
