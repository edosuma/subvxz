What's with the bathroom door?
It's not opening.

04:16.355 --> 04:17.759
‐Turn the knob.
Try turning it the other way.
‐I turned it, so...

04:17.792 --> 04:19.596
Can you fix this?

04:19.629 --> 04:21.466
I'm not the handyman, Dave.

04:21.500 --> 04:24.573
Look. I'm running errands all

04:24.606 --> 04:25.575

‐Okay, I‐I don't know

04:49.523 --> 04:50.457
what you're talking about,
but we're eating at this place

Dude's got bars, bro...

06:29.723 --> 06:31.860

How many MVPs have you won?

06:36.168 --> 06:37.839

06:39.441 --> 06:41.112
Geez Louise. You still hoop?

06:41.145 --> 06:42.749
No.

06:42.782 --> 06:44.552
I mean, look at these shorts.
They're so tight.

06:44.586 --> 06:46.590
Like, aren't things, like,
flying and flopping around?

06:46.623 --> 06:49.562
‐And, I mean, the goggles...
‐Can I offer you something
to drink?

06:49.596 --> 06:51.432
I'd love a tall drink of water.

06:51.465 --> 06:53.102
You know where I can find one?

06:53.136 --> 06:55.440
Just messin' around.
This is from the era when guys

06:55.473 --> 06:56.877
were, like, you know,
going around dribbling

06:56.910 --> 06:58.514
like this, you know,
and they're just, like...

06:58.547 --> 07:00.651
You got Cousy
running around, and...

07:00.685 --> 07:01.954
I feel like there were, like,

07:01.987 --> 07:03.791
Jewish men in the league
back then.

07:03.824 --> 07:06.697
Hey, how do you go about
picking a Muslim name?

07:06.730 --> 07:08.601
Like, how, like...

07:08.634 --> 07:10.504
what is that process?

07:11.506 --> 07:12.976
Let's go sit down.

07:13.009 --> 07:14.111
Yeah.

07:14.144 --> 07:15.781
All right.

07:15.815 --> 07:17.184
Wow, what a foyer. Or "foy‐yay."

07:17.217 --> 07:18.520
‐Oh, thanks.
‐Yeah.

07:18.554 --> 07:20.156
What do you even do all day?

07:20.190 --> 07:22.695
Well, these days
I spend a lot of time writing.

07:22.729 --> 07:24.031
Please, have a seat.

07:24.064 --> 07:25.801
Players' Tribune?

07:25.835 --> 07:27.705
I'm talking to them about,
uh, doing, like, a cartoon

07:27.739 --> 07:29.008
with Rajon Rondo.

07:29.041 --> 07:31.212
That's a crazy name:
Rajon Rondo.

07:31.245 --> 07:33.517
‐I wonder if he's, uh...
‐No,

07:33.550 --> 07:36.857
I‐I, uh, actually write
about social issues.

07:36.890 --> 07:38.560
‐Oh.
‐I'd love to write

07:38.594 --> 07:41.833
about you and your song.

07:41.867 --> 07:44.673
(sniffs) Hold on a minute,
I'm gonna go get some tea.

07:45.675 --> 07:47.545
Okay.

07:48.714 --> 07:50.718
Social issues?

07:55.193 --> 07:57.965
"By Kareem Abdul‐Jabbar."

07:57.999 --> 08:00.604
(teakettle whistling)

08:02.007 --> 08:03.644
"Race." "Privilege."

08:03.677 --> 08:05.080
"Lena Dunham"?

08:05.113 --> 08:07.250
Is this the same Kareem?

08:07.284 --> 08:09.756
‐(whistling loudly)
‐DAVE: How does he write
all these articles?

08:13.129 --> 08:15.534
If you don't mind,

08:15.568 --> 08:18.039
I'm gonna record
this conversation.

08:18.072 --> 08:21.145
Oh, uh, is this...
is this an interview?

08:21.178 --> 08:22.615
Yeah.

08:22.648 --> 08:23.984
(beep)

08:24.018 --> 08:25.053
DAVE:
Okay.

08:25.086 --> 08:26.957
What do you want to, uh...

08:26.990 --> 08:28.527
discuss?

08:28.560 --> 08:30.531
I'd like to know
what your inspiration was

08:30.564 --> 08:33.036
for superimposing your face...

08:33.069 --> 08:35.306
on my body.

08:35.340 --> 08:37.044
Sure. Uh...

08:37.077 --> 08:39.716
And just so you know,
it's, uh, not just my face,

08:39.749 --> 08:44.024
it's not just my facial skin‐‐
it was, like, my whole, uh...

08:44.058 --> 08:46.262
skull and cranial...

08:46.295 --> 08:48.166
It was... So...

08:48.199 --> 08:50.871
like, it's not, uh...

08:50.905 --> 08:52.642
it's not...

08:54.078 --> 08:56.550
...blackface.

08:56.583 --> 08:58.152
What would you call it?

08:58.186 --> 08:59.689
Black‐body?

08:59.723 --> 09:01.660
Mm...

09:01.693 --> 09:03.096
maybe.

09:03.129 --> 09:05.166
I... It's Kareem‐body.

09:05.200 --> 09:06.703
You know?

09:06.737 --> 09:08.272
Your body is, like, a sanctum.

09:08.306 --> 09:10.611
It's, like, it's‐it's, uh...

09:10.644 --> 09:12.214
it's so storied,

09:12.247 --> 09:15.755
and so it's more an homage
to your‐your, like,

09:15.788 --> 09:18.794
your physical being,
not anything racial.

09:20.831 --> 09:23.169
(whispers):
Kareem... body.

09:23.202 --> 09:25.340
And by the way,
I am so down to admit

09:25.373 --> 09:26.843
that, like, looking back,

09:26.877 --> 09:28.714
m‐maybe not the best decision,
you know?

09:28.747 --> 09:31.620
Uh, you should know I made it,
like, a year and a half ago,

09:31.653 --> 09:33.757
and back then I wasn't a racist,
but I certainly wasn't

09:33.791 --> 09:36.630
nearly as anti‐racist
as I am today.

09:36.663 --> 09:37.799
With...

09:39.301 --> 09:41.807
Um, so, but it was,
you know, uh...

09:41.840 --> 09:44.178
By the way, this‐‐ You didn't
say "on the record" ever,

09:44.211 --> 09:45.614
I hope you know.

09:45.648 --> 09:48.386
So none of this is,
uh, permissible.

09:48.419 --> 09:50.858
(coughs, burps)
There are...

09:50.891 --> 09:52.194
sanctions.

09:52.227 --> 09:54.264
‐I would hate to...
‐Strictly speaking,

09:54.298 --> 09:57.270
unless someone says
it's off the record,

09:57.304 --> 09:59.241
it's on the record.

10:00.243 --> 10:02.582
Can I say something
off the record real quick?

10:03.717 --> 10:04.752
Yeah.

10:05.754 --> 10:07.257
I'm high.

10:07.290 --> 10:09.863
Uh, I didn't know
that this was, like, gonna be

10:09.896 --> 10:11.332
this at all,
and I kind of, like,

10:11.365 --> 10:13.169
you know, mentally treated this

10:13.202 --> 10:15.908
like going to, like, a IMAX
or, like‐‐ I was so excited.

10:15.941 --> 10:18.847
And I'm working on that,
having to smoke for joy.

10:18.881 --> 10:21.185
‐I would never even call it
a shtick. I'm just saying...
‐There's a lot more,

10:21.218 --> 10:23.790
‐uh, of‐of a conversation
to be had...
‐(overlapping chatter)

10:23.824 --> 10:25.360
Around acne right now...

10:25.393 --> 10:26.997
...tons of nuance
to this whole thing.

10:27.030 --> 10:28.901
I used to read
the Harry Potter books.

10:28.934 --> 10:30.704
Never watched a documentary.

10:30.738 --> 10:32.073
Have you ever heard of Babylon?

10:32.107 --> 10:33.342
(overlapping chatter)

10:33.376 --> 10:35.748
Tomorrow. What are you doing?

10:35.781 --> 10:38.085
'Cause maybe we spend the day
together, and I'll show you

10:38.119 --> 10:41.425
the real me, and you can write,
like, a full‐on profile on me.

10:41.458 --> 10:42.829
No one's ever done that.

10:42.862 --> 10:44.899
Uh, if you're available.

10:46.168 --> 10:49.007
Okay. You know, I was
just gonna write a blurb on you

10:49.041 --> 10:51.713
about my name in‐in your song.

10:51.746 --> 10:53.249
‐Oh.
‐But, uh,

10:53.282 --> 10:55.086
if you want to do a deep dive,
that's fine.

10:55.119 --> 10:57.424
That'll give me a chance
to dig deeper.

10:57.457 --> 10:58.392
Cool.

10:58.426 --> 11:00.196
That's great.

11:01.432 --> 11:04.672
Hope you like... Jews.

11:04.706 --> 11:06.175
I'm saying,
I just don't get it. I‐‐

11:06.208 --> 11:08.312
Like, you eat sugar, like,
for every single meal

11:08.346 --> 11:10.116
and you weigh, like, 125 pounds.

11:10.149 --> 11:12.120
‐Just‐‐ And you're cut.
‐Right. Uh‐huh.

11:12.153 --> 11:13.389
You have an eight‐pack.
It's gross.

11:13.422 --> 11:15.126
I have a one‐pack
for the rest of my life.

11:15.159 --> 11:17.464
That's true.
What the fuck?!

11:17.498 --> 11:18.934
Be careful, man.
There's eggs in there.

11:18.967 --> 11:20.403
You ain't gonna believe this,
bro.

11:20.436 --> 11:23.109
I got a audition
for Rhythm + Flow, dawg.

11:23.142 --> 11:24.913
‐Are they rebooting
a Terrence Howard pimp movie?
‐This has

11:24.946 --> 11:27.150
nothing to do with pimpin',
simpin' and limpin', bro.

11:27.183 --> 11:28.954
‐"Pimpin', simpin' and limpin'"?
‐This is way bigger than that.

11:28.987 --> 11:30.390
Ten times bigger than that.
This is American Idol

11:30.423 --> 11:32.093
for rappers, dawg.
Like, you don't understand

11:32.127 --> 11:33.362
how big this is for me.

11:33.396 --> 11:34.966
Honestly, I'm proud of you, man.
That's...

11:34.999 --> 11:37.003
‐God's at work, huh?
‐Bro,

11:37.037 --> 11:39.241
‐don't bring God in this.
I'm blessed.
‐Right. Right.

11:39.274 --> 11:41.780
Hey, remember.
I'm gonna be on Rhythm + Flow.

11:41.813 --> 11:43.817
You're gonna be on Rhythm
+ Flow. I've got it locked in.

11:43.850 --> 11:45.486
‐(knob rattling)
‐Oh, Gata, Gata,

11:45.521 --> 11:48.125
the‐the knob is broken. I got
to get it fixed today, so...

11:48.159 --> 11:50.864
Man, don't worry about it, Mike.
I got a migo at the car shop.

11:50.898 --> 11:53.202
I'm‐a get it fixed.
He got all the tools.

11:53.236 --> 11:54.772
‐(door opens forcefully)
‐Whoo!

11:54.806 --> 11:56.910
Wonderful. Perfect.

11:56.943 --> 11:59.248
DAVE:
That's fine.

11:59.281 --> 12:01.418
That's okay.

12:01.452 --> 12:03.222
That's fine. Oh, here's one.

12:03.256 --> 12:06.262
"If being attracted
to 17‐year‐old girls is illegal,

12:06.295 --> 12:08.165
then send me straight
to Azkaban."

12:08.199 --> 12:10.036
Wh‐‐ Delete that. Oh, my God.

12:10.069 --> 12:11.873
‐You tweeted that at some point?
‐I'm just saying,

12:11.907 --> 12:14.211
like, you can tell when
a 17‐year‐old girl is, like,

12:14.244 --> 12:15.781
‐destined to be hot.
‐Blah, blah, blah.

12:15.814 --> 12:17.083
‐Don't. No.
‐What does that even mean?

12:17.117 --> 12:18.152
Mike, how the fuck
do you send me

12:18.185 --> 12:19.454
to this guy's house, high,

12:19.488 --> 12:22.528
having no idea
it's a fucking interview?

12:22.561 --> 12:24.197
We can have
a deeper conversation about that

12:24.231 --> 12:27.203
at another time, because
I myself am very high now.

12:27.237 --> 12:29.909
I just need to show this guy
that I'm a good person.

12:29.943 --> 12:31.078
‐Nah.
‐You could just be
a good person.

12:31.111 --> 12:32.480
‐(laughs)
‐I am a good person.

12:32.515 --> 12:34.217
What do you mean?
Of course I'm a good person.

12:34.251 --> 12:35.888
He's just not around me enough
to, like, understand

12:35.921 --> 12:37.290
my added value, socially.

12:37.324 --> 12:38.994
Did you really tweet

12:39.027 --> 12:41.231
‐"Can nonbinary people
fuck themselves?"
‐Yeah.

12:41.265 --> 12:43.269
It's a brilliant tweet.
What's wrong with that tweet?

12:43.302 --> 12:45.808
Do you even know
what "nonbinary" means?

12:45.841 --> 12:47.511
I understand what it means.
Like, they can fuck them‐‐

12:47.545 --> 12:49.114
Like, if you don't understand,
I don't know what to tell you.

12:49.147 --> 12:50.918
And it's brilliant.
And I'm a good person.

12:50.951 --> 12:54.024
But I will delete it,
because I'm being scrutinized

12:54.057 --> 12:56.295
by a seven‐foot‐three man
made of silk.

12:56.328 --> 12:59.034
I don't know how I'm gonna spend
an entire day with Kareem

12:59.067 --> 13:01.105
without saying something crazy.
It's not possible.

13:01.138 --> 13:03.376
I don't know how you'll last
an hour, to be honest.

13:03.409 --> 13:06.148
‐That's what I'm saying.
‐No. You guys, shut up.

13:06.181 --> 13:07.518
You've won the hearts
of many people

13:07.551 --> 13:10.189
that should have hated you
so many times.

13:10.223 --> 13:11.793
Like who?

13:12.995 --> 13:14.966
I'm sorry. I'm very high.
I was rambling.

13:14.999 --> 13:17.137
‐But‐but this is gonna be
a good press opportunity.
‐(Emma laughs)

13:17.170 --> 13:19.007
I'm gonna get fucking crucified.

13:27.457 --> 13:28.927
Hey.

13:28.960 --> 13:30.430
Hey, Dave. What's up?

13:30.463 --> 13:32.033
Just, uh, enjoying

13:32.067 --> 13:33.402
the, uh... the weather.

13:33.436 --> 13:35.541
The climate is, uh...

13:35.574 --> 13:36.943
Awesome out here, isn't it?

13:36.976 --> 13:38.914
‐Surviving today. Yeah.
‐Yeah.

13:38.947 --> 13:41.886
Although, obviously,
politically and, um,

13:41.920 --> 13:44.458
meteorologically, it's...

13:44.492 --> 13:46.161
been a challenge.

13:46.195 --> 13:48.099
And will continue to be
a challenge.

13:49.101 --> 13:50.470
Thank you for meeting me here.

13:50.504 --> 13:52.207
Not a problem.

13:52.240 --> 13:54.344
‐Let me get, uh...
‐(beep)
‐On the record.

13:54.378 --> 13:56.549
‐Yes. We're on the record.
‐Yes.

13:56.583 --> 13:58.185
‐Okay.
‐That's how it has to be.

13:58.219 --> 13:59.354
That's okay.

13:59.388 --> 14:01.058
Okay. So, look, Dave,

14:01.091 --> 14:03.497
hip‐hop is a very crowded space
these days.

14:03.530 --> 14:04.599
Yeah.

14:04.632 --> 14:06.435
What do you bring to the table?

14:06.468 --> 14:08.439
Great question.

14:08.472 --> 14:10.376
Uh, I...

14:10.410 --> 14:12.213
am me.

14:12.247 --> 14:15.119
You know? I'm, like, my
unapologetic self at all times,

14:15.153 --> 14:17.257
and I think that's very clear
when you listen to my music,

14:17.290 --> 14:18.894
that I'm very authentic.

14:18.927 --> 14:21.566
Well, you know,
you speak with a blaccent

14:21.599 --> 14:23.603
in your music,

14:23.637 --> 14:26.175
but you don't sound anything
like that right now.

14:27.210 --> 14:29.916
I'm unfamiliar with the phrase
"blaccent." Um...

14:29.949 --> 14:31.920
I'm not offended by it.
I'm just‐‐ I'm, um...

14:31.953 --> 14:33.456
I just think that,

14:33.489 --> 14:36.930
if I was, like, really rapping
exactly how I'm talking,

14:36.963 --> 14:38.199
I'd be the only one
that sounded that way,

14:38.232 --> 14:39.969
and it'd look like I was, like,

14:40.002 --> 14:42.407
you know, making fun of everyone
else in the rap community,

14:42.440 --> 14:44.277
being like, "Here's how I rap,

14:44.311 --> 14:46.950
and I'm going to get a java."

14:47.985 --> 14:49.087
So let me get this straight.

14:49.121 --> 14:50.389
You're more concerned

14:50.423 --> 14:52.193
with offending
the hip‐hop community

14:52.227 --> 14:54.464
than you are the general public?

14:54.499 --> 14:55.968
No.

14:56.001 --> 14:57.972
I like, uh...
I'm very cause... al.

14:58.005 --> 14:58.974
I'm very causal.

14:59.007 --> 15:00.243
I...

15:00.276 --> 15:02.480
GH, for example.

15:02.515 --> 15:04.084
GH?

15:04.117 --> 15:05.486
Genital herpes.

15:05.521 --> 15:07.958
Um, 'cause I'm trying
to destigmatize it.

15:07.992 --> 15:09.629
There's a‐‐
there's a huge stigma.

15:09.662 --> 15:11.265
One in six people have it, and
it's like‐‐ people act like,

15:11.298 --> 15:13.102
if you have it,
it's the worst thing ever.

15:13.135 --> 15:14.505
And we don't hook up with people

15:14.539 --> 15:16.241
and we make 'em feel
like lepers.

15:16.275 --> 15:17.678
It's like chicken pox.

15:17.711 --> 15:19.982
Do we, like, go up to kids
who have chicken pox

15:20.016 --> 15:22.320
and say, "Get out of here,
I'm not gonna suck you."

15:22.353 --> 15:24.291
Uh, I'm very...

15:24.324 --> 15:26.295
advocate...

15:26.328 --> 15:28.165
of all things.

15:28.199 --> 15:30.369
My mom sends me, like, a summary
of, like, the current events,

15:30.403 --> 15:33.042
because, like, CNN.com,
the format is just unbearable.

15:33.075 --> 15:34.311
I don't know
how people read that website.

15:34.344 --> 15:35.581
Like, get better art direction.

15:35.614 --> 15:36.716
And "wifebeater,"

15:36.749 --> 15:38.319
what an antiquated phrase
that is.

15:38.352 --> 15:41.258
It's like calling
a‐a sweatshirt a rapist, no?

15:41.291 --> 15:43.730
‐(shuts off engine)
‐(grunts)

15:43.763 --> 15:46.268
Goddamn it.

15:46.301 --> 15:48.005
‐I'm sorry about that, Kareem.
‐My God.

15:48.038 --> 15:49.174
I would've ordered us
a bigger car,

15:49.207 --> 15:51.044
but, until Uber's unionized,

15:51.078 --> 15:53.315
I can't even consider something
like that. Drives me nuts.

15:53.349 --> 15:55.186
You know, I'm‐‐
It's claustrophobic, man.

15:55.219 --> 15:57.457
I don't like being in a place
where it's too small.

15:57.490 --> 15:59.394
‐You know?
‐I hear you. Completely.
Maybe, on the way back,

15:59.427 --> 16:01.599
you could, like,
lie flat across the back.

16:01.633 --> 16:04.404
I don't know if the windows
being cracked helps or...

16:04.437 --> 16:06.676
Uh, hey,
would you mind giving me a hand?

16:06.709 --> 16:09.014
‐What?
‐Yeah. Just‐‐ I just...

16:09.047 --> 16:10.617
(grunts): Yeah. I know we were
in the middle or something,

16:10.651 --> 16:12.287
but...

16:12.320 --> 16:14.057
just something
I've been doing lately

16:14.090 --> 16:16.461
in terms of... raising, uh,

16:16.496 --> 16:19.067
funds and money
for the community.

16:19.100 --> 16:22.173
If you want to roll in there, we
could, uh, surprise these kids.

16:22.207 --> 16:25.446
No, actually, I‐I have some,
uh, phone calls I have to make.

16:25.479 --> 16:26.783
You don't want to come in?

16:26.816 --> 16:28.452
I really got to make
these calls. You know...

16:28.485 --> 16:30.056
Okay. If you're worried
about them swarming you,

16:30.089 --> 16:31.593
they're more
of an Anthony Davis community.

16:31.626 --> 16:33.329
Hi, Melanie. How you doing?

16:33.362 --> 16:34.565
DAVE:
All right.

16:34.599 --> 16:36.068
KAREEM:
Yeah.

16:36.101 --> 16:37.370
‐Exactly.
‐I'll be back in a few minutes.

16:37.403 --> 16:40.042
I wonder what your thoughts are
on that.

16:40.076 --> 16:41.513
ALLY:
And I know fundraising

16:41.546 --> 16:43.182
is never easy,

16:43.215 --> 16:44.519
but we live in L. A.!

16:44.552 --> 16:47.791
And while that has
its quirks, uh,

16:47.825 --> 16:50.062
it also has tons
of wealthy people.

16:50.096 --> 16:52.066
‐(chuckling)
‐Right?

16:52.100 --> 16:53.637
But, seriously,
if anybody you know

who works in the arts
or in music...

Uh, let's... get in
on that pizza,

17:09.100 --> 17:10.537
‐everybody!
‐Where are the kids?

17:10.571 --> 17:12.340
‐What are you doing here?
‐Hi.

17:12.373 --> 17:14.277
There's pizza? Is there
buffalo chicken pizza here?

17:14.311 --> 17:16.348
I don't think, like,
a bank will accept one of these,

17:16.381 --> 17:20.524
so I do have a very legitimate,
real check right here.

17:20.557 --> 17:21.759
‐There you go.
‐I‐‐

17:21.793 --> 17:23.530
Dave, I can't accept that.

17:27.403 --> 17:29.107
For the kids.

17:29.140 --> 17:30.677
‐Thank you.
‐Sure.

17:30.711 --> 17:32.648
I've actually left out
the most important detail.

17:32.681 --> 17:36.188
Kareem Abdul‐Jabbar is outside
right now, in my car.

17:36.221 --> 17:38.660
He's writing a profile on me.
If I brought him in,

17:38.693 --> 17:40.664
I'm pretty sure
that everyone's pockets would...

17:40.697 --> 17:42.367
So this is‐‐ You're doing this

17:42.400 --> 17:44.639
because someone is writing
an article about you?

17:44.672 --> 17:47.243
‐That... makes sense.
‐No. I‐I'm doing it

17:47.277 --> 17:49.815
‐for you.
‐No, I‐I didn't ask for this.

17:49.849 --> 17:52.521
I'm‐I'm unhappy
that you did this.

17:52.554 --> 17:54.124
All I was trying to do is show

17:54.157 --> 17:56.529
a supportive gesture
of friendship.

17:56.562 --> 17:57.564
Dave, the other night,
when you came over,

17:57.598 --> 17:59.134
that‐that was the first time

17:59.167 --> 18:00.469
we've seen each other
in four months.

18:00.504 --> 18:02.741
Like, I would not qualify us
as friends.

18:02.775 --> 18:05.146
‐We should be.
‐Oh!

18:05.179 --> 18:06.415
We should be friends.
I don't understand.

18:06.448 --> 18:08.553
How long are we gonna not talk,
forever?

18:08.586 --> 18:11.158
Can't we just not f‐fuck
and, like... (stammers)

18:11.191 --> 18:13.295
‐...and, like, matter
to each other? Like...
‐Dave, if you took sex

18:13.329 --> 18:15.299
out of our relationship,

18:15.333 --> 18:18.205
it doesn't just become
friendship all of a sudden.

18:18.238 --> 18:19.542
Okay? It would be me

18:19.575 --> 18:22.781
being your human
emotional support animal.

18:23.750 --> 18:26.154
I didn't realize
sex was so impactful

18:26.188 --> 18:28.425
‐in terms of‐‐ I'm just kidding.
‐Oh, my God.

18:28.459 --> 18:30.564
Okay, Al, I did not mean to have
this conversation right now.

18:30.597 --> 18:31.833
Like, I didn't mean
to do this at your work.

18:31.866 --> 18:32.835
I am sorry for that.

18:32.868 --> 18:34.605
What if you came over after work

18:34.639 --> 18:36.876
‐and we just, like, talked
about ever...
‐No. No.

18:36.909 --> 18:38.847
We're not gonna talk
because you want to talk.

18:38.880 --> 18:41.853
This is all of the same shit
all over again.

18:41.886 --> 18:45.192
You're so self‐centered, still.

18:45.226 --> 18:47.598
(stammers)
This is exactly why,

18:47.631 --> 18:49.467
even when I‐‐ when I loved you,

18:49.502 --> 18:52.541
I did not like you.

18:54.411 --> 18:56.683
Uh... 'kay.

18:57.885 --> 18:59.755
Noted.

19:35.527 --> 19:37.463
Damn. Yeah. That's me.

All right.

R + F is filmed in front

19:53.997 --> 19:55.634
of a live studio audience.

19:55.667 --> 19:57.771

‐come on, dude.
‐Wait. This is y'all two?

20:57.558 --> 20:59.495
How are you so bad
at freestyling, though?

20:59.528 --> 21:00.897
I mean, you said
you really do this.

21:00.931 --> 21:03.302
Y'all think
I'm a fucking joke?

21:03.335 --> 21:04.939
‐Bro, it's gonna get views, man.
‐Bro, it's a prank.
It was never meant...

21:04.972 --> 21:06.809
Fucking views, nigga.
What about my emotions, nigga?

21:06.843 --> 21:09.715
‐Bro, I swear...
‐Man, fuck all that, bro.

21:09.748 --> 21:11.384

‐CODY: It's funny, bro.

21:14.692 --> 21:15.961
BRODY:
It's just a prank.

21:15.994 --> 21:16.996
GATA:
Hey, prank these nuts, nigga.

21:17.029 --> 21:19.568
CODY:
It's a prank.

21:19.602 --> 21:20.871
(glass shatters)

21:20.904 --> 21:22.941
Waste of my fucking time.

21:28.485 --> 21:31.526
(sighs)

21:32.494 --> 21:34.865
Okay. Um, just a couple
more questions.

21:36.468 --> 21:37.871
Sure.

21:37.905 --> 21:40.710
Are you okay?

21:42.748 --> 21:44.819
Just write whatever
you want about me.

21:44.852 --> 21:46.856
I‐I can't be this person
for that,

21:46.889 --> 21:48.793
and that person for this person.
It's...

21:48.827 --> 21:51.064
I am who I am, so...

21:51.097 --> 21:54.037
just call it how you see it.

21:55.039 --> 21:57.410
Do you think
you're a good person?

22:00.115 --> 22:04.457
Honestly, my biggest fear is
that I'm not.

22:04.490 --> 22:07.965
You know, I have
this constant vision

22:07.998 --> 22:10.069
where I'm dead,

22:10.102 --> 22:12.975
and I'm, like, floating up
to heaven or whatever,

22:13.008 --> 22:16.047
and I get there, and God's
laughing at me, and he's like,

22:16.081 --> 22:18.987
"Is that what you thought
the whole point of life was?"

22:19.020 --> 22:22.728
Because I know
that I'm so singularly focused

22:22.761 --> 22:25.800
on this...
chasing my legacy type of thing

22:25.834 --> 22:28.706
and being this great artist
and all that, but it's, like,

22:28.740 --> 22:31.044
obviously, that's not, like,
what life is about.

22:31.077 --> 22:32.948
But at the same time,

22:32.981 --> 22:36.087
if I don't give my all into
being that, I'll never be that,

22:36.121 --> 22:38.693
and I'll never figure out
my album.

22:38.726 --> 22:41.499
And I also see these DMs
from kids, and they're like,

22:41.532 --> 22:43.870
"Hey, Lil Dicky, I'm depressed,

22:43.903 --> 22:45.874
"and when I listen to
your music, I'm a little less,

22:45.907 --> 22:47.511
and, like, thank you for that."

22:47.544 --> 22:49.080
And, like, that really happens,

22:49.113 --> 22:51.084
and that's what
the point of life is, right,

22:51.117 --> 22:52.621
to, like, do good.

22:52.654 --> 22:54.457
And I feel like
the bigger I get,

22:54.490 --> 22:56.662
the more good I can do,
so, it's, like, by my logic,

22:56.696 --> 22:58.967
the way that I can do
the most good on Earth is

22:59.000 --> 23:01.071
by becoming the biggest artist
in the world, you know?

23:01.104 --> 23:02.908
Like, so I have to be selfish.

23:02.941 --> 23:06.181
It's my destiny or whatever.

23:06.214 --> 23:08.051
(laughs)

23:08.085 --> 23:09.855
Dave,

23:09.888 --> 23:13.496
that's the most creative excuse
for being narcissistic

23:13.529 --> 23:14.798
I've ever heard.

23:14.832 --> 23:16.535
That's pretty good, though.
(laughs)

23:16.569 --> 23:19.474
Thanks. Well, I'm happy
you liked it. Uh...

23:19.508 --> 23:20.977
You're funny, boy,
I'll tell you that.

23:21.011 --> 23:23.415
I appreciate that.

23:23.448 --> 23:25.152
I got to use the restroom.
Where?

23:25.185 --> 23:27.991
It's over there.

23:29.728 --> 23:31.064

23:31.097 --> 23:32.601

23:33.970 --> 23:35.674
Mike, where the fuck
you at, bro?

23:35.707 --> 23:37.911
Mike, you got some explaining
to do, motherfucker!

23:37.945 --> 23:39.882
‐Whoa. Hey.
‐Mike, where you at?

23:39.915 --> 23:43.021
Mike, you red‐headed pussy,
where the fuck you at?

23:43.055 --> 23:45.025
‐Mike? Mike, where you at, bro?
‐Gata.

23:45.059 --> 23:46.629
‐Gata. Chill.
‐Man, you fucking
played me, dog.

23:46.662 --> 23:48.700
‐Shh. Kareem is here.
‐How you gonna do me like

23:48.733 --> 23:50.604
‐like that, bro? We supposed
to be boys, man.
‐Relax. Relax. Relax.

23:50.637 --> 23:52.139
‐How you gonna prank me
like that, bro?
‐Kareem is here.

23:52.173 --> 23:54.177
‐Chill out. Gata, relax.
‐Come on. I trusted you, bro.

23:54.210 --> 23:55.981
‐Hey.
‐Waste of my fucking time.
‐Gata, I had no idea that...

23:56.014 --> 23:56.983
‐MIKE: Gata.
‐GATA: Biggest chance to fame,
bro.

23:57.016 --> 23:58.720
DAVE:
Gata, stop.

23:58.753 --> 24:00.122
MIKE:
I didn't know they were
gonna prank you.

24:00.155 --> 24:01.926
‐GATA: They pranked me, bro.
‐MIKE: I know.

24:01.959 --> 24:03.228
‐They never fucking
told me, bro.
‐Hey, Dave?

24:03.261 --> 24:04.665
Is there something wrong
with your door?

24:04.698 --> 24:05.567
(indistinct,
overlapping chatter)

24:05.600 --> 24:07.036
Hey, Dave, come on, man!

24:07.069 --> 24:09.240
I don't like being
in a small space like this!

24:09.273 --> 24:10.510
‐Stop. Stop.
‐Man, fuck all that, bro.

24:10.543 --> 24:11.812
This nigga's a buster, nigga.

24:11.846 --> 24:13.048
‐Relax. Relax. I had no idea.
‐Stop.

24:13.081 --> 24:14.083
‐I'm just their manager.
‐Stop. Stop.

24:14.117 --> 24:15.085
They don't tell me anything.

24:15.119 --> 24:16.021
You're just whose manager?

24:16.054 --> 24:17.691
You didn't even tell him.

24:17.724 --> 24:19.093
No, I didn't, 'cause
I didn't have a chance to.

24:19.127 --> 24:20.797
I‐I'm... They're just
TikTok stars, and a...

24:20.830 --> 24:22.199
‐He got a new client, bro.
‐It's a side project.

24:22.233 --> 24:23.803
It's not like
you're making music anyway.

24:23.836 --> 24:25.507
It's not gonna impact
our business at all.

24:25.540 --> 24:27.043
What do you mean, it's not gonna
affect our business?

24:27.076 --> 24:28.145
Maybe if you weren't on TikTok,
I would have known

24:28.178 --> 24:28.980
Kareem was a fucking journal...

24:29.013 --> 24:29.948
(loud knocking)

24:29.982 --> 24:31.786
Is that door not fixed?

24:31.819 --> 24:33.923
First of all, Gata said he could
fix the door. I asked him...

24:33.956 --> 24:35.259
Hey, Kareem,
you having trouble in there?

24:35.292 --> 24:36.495
KAREEM:
What's going on with the door?

24:36.529 --> 24:37.798
Yeah, it's this, uh, knob thing.

24:37.831 --> 24:39.601
KAREEM:
Well, does it open or what?

24:39.635 --> 24:40.737
DAVE:
Try twisting it.

24:40.770 --> 24:42.173
Let me out of here, man!

24:42.206 --> 24:45.245
(indistinct,
overlapping shouting)

24:45.279 --> 24:46.816
‐Kareem, don't worry about it.
‐You're the one that said...

24:46.849 --> 24:48.653
How the fuck did you not
fix this door? Uh...

24:48.686 --> 24:49.955
He said he knew someone that
could fix the fucking door!

24:49.988 --> 24:51.559
GATA:
I work for Dave, not for you.

24:51.592 --> 24:52.259
Kareem, I'm just gonna ram
in there, okay,

24:52.293 --> 24:53.763
so back up, Kareem.

24:53.796 --> 24:55.667
I asked one person
to fix the fucking door.

24:55.700 --> 24:57.604
All of that is just
goddamn bullshit, bro.

24:57.637 --> 24:58.806
‐GATA: Come on, man.
‐Let me out.

24:58.840 --> 24:59.875
GATA:
A real man ain't

24:59.908 --> 25:01.277
gonna walk away. Stay in here

25:01.311 --> 25:02.814
‐and talk about this shit, man.
‐No, dude.

25:02.848 --> 25:04.718
When you say you're gonna
do something...

25:04.752 --> 25:05.854
You're the one that said you're
gonna fix the fucking door.

25:05.887 --> 25:07.758
(indistinct chatter)

25:07.791 --> 25:09.928
‐(yells)
‐GATA: Trying to do shit
with that knife, bro.

25:09.962 --> 25:11.899
‐Hey, hey. What is going on?
‐Go put that fucking knife
down, bro.

25:11.932 --> 25:13.803
‐Hey, Ally.
‐Your rams are coming out...

25:13.836 --> 25:14.838
‐What the fuck is happening?
‐Back up.

25:14.872 --> 25:16.575
Kareem, I have a knife, and

25:16.609 --> 25:18.880
‐I'm gonna jimmy the door.
‐No! No!
‐(shouting)

25:18.913 --> 25:21.284
Stop! You're gonna hurt him!
Stop!

25:21.317 --> 25:23.656
No. My machine! My machine!

25:23.689 --> 25:25.292
ALLY:
Oh.

25:25.325 --> 25:27.531
‐(Kareem groaning)
‐Uh...

25:27.564 --> 25:30.169
‐Oh, God! (groans)
‐(Dave whimpers)

25:30.202 --> 25:33.241
‐(groans, inhales sharply)
‐Oh, God. Ugh.

25:33.275 --> 25:34.945
‐KAREEM: Ow! (groans)
‐Oh, my God.

25:34.978 --> 25:36.649
Oh.

25:36.682 --> 25:37.984
It's okay. We're gonna call
the ambulance. Uh...

25:43.228 --> 25:44.297
‐(groans)
‐DAVE: Kicked in...
‐MIKE: The pressure

25:44.330 --> 25:45.900
from the door‐‐ it snapped open,

25:45.934 --> 25:47.336
‐and then there was... blood.
‐Was blood.

25:47.369 --> 25:49.340
‐A lot of blood.
‐Uh, uh...

25:49.373 --> 25:52.012
I‐I don't know if he'll, like...
(sighs)

25:52.046 --> 25:53.315
MIKE:
There's no way he's gonna die.

25:53.348 --> 25:55.185
Right? There's no way
he gonna die.

25:55.219 --> 25:57.624
‐(phone chimes repeatedly)
‐BRODY: Yo, we got Gata.

25:57.657 --> 25:59.193
‐Fuck.
‐We got our boy Gata in here.

25:59.227 --> 26:00.997
We got a good prank
for you guys.

26:01.030 --> 26:02.768
‐Yeah, bro. Yeah, bro.
‐Swipe up.

26:02.801 --> 26:04.270
‐Swipe up and watch this.
‐Comment down below.

26:04.303 --> 26:06.141
‐How good did we get him?
‐What the hell?

26:06.174 --> 26:07.911
These followers crazy, bro.

26:07.944 --> 26:09.313
This shit nuts, boy.

26:09.347 --> 26:11.084
Damn.

26:11.117 --> 26:13.756
Hey, y'all, swipe up
on this video, man.

26:13.790 --> 26:15.693
I just got pranked
by The Stone Twins.

26:15.727 --> 26:18.265
Make sure y'all tap in,
swipe up, share the video.

26:21.806 --> 26:23.643
(garbled radio transmission)

26:23.676 --> 26:25.814
Hi. Uh...

26:25.847 --> 26:28.786
You forgot
to sign the check, so...

26:28.820 --> 26:31.257
Oh. Okay. Sorry.

26:31.291 --> 26:35.700
How do I even...?
So tricky when it's not a big...

26:35.733 --> 26:37.804
Oh. Thank you.

26:37.838 --> 26:39.842
I will avoid your wound.

26:39.875 --> 26:41.377
‐(clears throat)
‐So,

26:41.411 --> 26:43.381
you're still just as mad at me?

26:43.415 --> 26:45.385
‐Yeah.
‐Okay.

26:45.419 --> 26:47.858
But it's not just that.

26:47.891 --> 26:50.095
I'm... (sighs)

26:50.129 --> 26:52.199
I really wasn't ready
to see you the other night,

26:52.233 --> 26:54.805
so I am upset at myself
for letting you in,

26:54.838 --> 26:56.709
but that's my...

26:56.742 --> 26:58.211
Are you‐you...?

26:58.245 --> 27:00.149
‐You're done, right?
‐Oh, yeah. Sorry.

27:00.182 --> 27:02.119
I was just intensely
listening to...

27:02.153 --> 27:03.823
Here you go.

27:03.856 --> 27:07.396
But that's my stuff,
and I‐I took it out on you,

27:07.429 --> 27:10.335
and I was mean,
and I'm sorry for that.

27:10.369 --> 27:12.808
Totally forgiven.
Don't even...

27:12.841 --> 27:15.345
But you can't ambush me
like that.

27:15.379 --> 27:17.349
‐No, I can't.
‐Like, the other day or today.

27:17.383 --> 27:18.986
‐Like...
‐I agree. I'm sorry. That was...

27:19.020 --> 27:20.690
I really am sorry.

27:20.723 --> 27:24.363
'Cause, listen,
if we're gonna be friends, it...

27:24.397 --> 27:27.871
it's not gonna be this
only‐on‐Dave's‐terms thing.

27:27.904 --> 27:29.173
‐No, throw that...
‐Okay?

27:29.207 --> 27:30.910
‐It's a new...
‐New regime.

27:30.944 --> 27:32.714
‐New regime.
‐You're the queen
of that regime.

27:32.747 --> 27:34.250
‐Yeah.
‐I will do whatever
you say, honestly,

27:34.283 --> 27:37.757
‐to make this friendship work.
‐Dave, this is $5,000.

27:37.791 --> 27:39.227
Oh, yeah. I tweaked the check.

27:39.260 --> 27:40.697
‐Um...
‐(laughing): Are you trying

27:40.730 --> 27:42.366
to buy my friendship?

27:42.399 --> 27:44.838
Yeah, I was, and it worked.

27:44.872 --> 27:46.876
‐You know,
it's for the kids, so...
‐Thank you.

27:46.909 --> 27:48.779
‐...happy to...
‐No. Seriously.

27:48.813 --> 27:50.315
‐Oh.
‐Hey, I'm just gonna deal
with this real quick.

27:50.349 --> 27:52.253
‐Yeah. Is he gonna be okay?
‐Yeah. I don't know.

27:52.286 --> 27:53.756
I thought he was made of silk,

27:53.789 --> 27:55.994
but it's more like
uncooked pasta.

27:56.027 --> 27:57.463
‐(Kareem groans softly)
‐Okay.

27:57.497 --> 28:00.002
‐ALLY: Ugh.
‐Guys need a hand?

28:00.035 --> 28:02.373
No?

28:05.078 --> 28:07.049
(groans)

28:07.082 --> 28:09.821
Kareem, I am so sorry
that this happened.

28:09.855 --> 28:11.157
I know the article's
the last thing on your mind,

28:11.190 --> 28:12.426
but if you need me to...

28:12.459 --> 28:14.798
Hey, I'm not writing an article.

28:14.831 --> 28:15.900
No?

28:15.934 --> 28:18.071
You are not.

28:18.104 --> 28:19.775
I'm not...?

28:19.808 --> 28:21.712
Hey, man,
get‐get me out of here.

28:22.514 --> 28:24.818
Get me out of here, man.

28:24.851 --> 28:26.922
I'm not...
