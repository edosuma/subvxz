WEBVTT

00:06.367 --> 00:07.100
"You think you're better

00:07.135 --> 00:07.834
Than everyone else?"

00:07.869 --> 00:09.069
So I go, "well, pretty much,

00:09.103 --> 00:11.004
Yeah," which was just

00:11.038 --> 00:12.438
Me being...

00:12.473 --> 00:19.903
Tori, come on!

00:19.937 --> 00:21.069
Did you not see me fall down

00:21.103 --> 00:23.009
In the parking lot?

00:23.043 --> 00:24.537
It was very funny.

00:24.572 --> 00:26.327
I wasn't trying to be...

00:26.361 --> 00:28.543
Oh, the new play roster!

00:28.578 --> 00:30.429
Hold my coffee.

00:30.463 --> 00:33.454
Move.

00:34.764 --> 00:36.812
These are so good.

00:36.846 --> 00:38.528
Don't spill that.

00:38.563 --> 00:39.502
Now, what's so good?

00:39.537 --> 00:40.236
The list of plays

00:40.271 --> 00:41.347
For this semester.

00:41.381 --> 00:43.086
Oh my God, I am perfect

00:43.120 --> 00:45.467
For all these.

00:45.502 --> 00:46.201
Is "moonlight magic"

00:46.236 --> 00:47.240
On there?

00:47.274 --> 00:48.716
Yeah, number four, why?

00:48.751 --> 00:49.755
Andre wrote the music for it.

00:49.789 --> 00:50.459
He wants me to try out

00:50.494 --> 00:51.397
For the lead.

00:51.432 --> 00:55.481
You? Why?

00:55.516 --> 00:57.252
Take your coffee and go.

00:57.287 --> 00:58.492
Oh, somebody fell down

00:58.526 --> 00:59.193
On the wrong side

00:59.227 --> 01:04.780
Of the parking lot.

01:04.815 --> 01:05.884
Need some help?

01:05.919 --> 01:06.821
Yes.

01:06.855 --> 01:09.999
Interesting.

01:10.033 --> 01:10.602
And you're saying

01:10.636 --> 01:12.139
That movie's not scary?

01:12.174 --> 01:13.076
No, I'm saying

01:13.111 --> 01:15.920
It's not as scary as tofu.

01:15.954 --> 01:16.387
Why are you always

01:16.424 --> 01:17.593
Rippin' on tofu?

01:17.627 --> 01:20.397
'Cause it tastes like snot.

01:20.433 --> 01:22.672
And snot does not taste good.

01:22.706 --> 01:23.441
Hey, look who's here.

01:24.043 --> 01:25.145
Hey, can you guys help me?

01:25.179 --> 01:26.247
Sure.

01:28.387 --> 01:29.624
Just keep that over there.

01:29.659 --> 01:30.091
Let's probably get

01:30.126 --> 01:32.964
Some shelves or something.

01:32.998 --> 01:33.733
There we go.

01:33.767 --> 01:34.334
All set.

01:34.368 --> 01:34.936
Thanks.

01:37.944 --> 01:38.812
Never put me down

01:38.846 --> 01:40.448
Like that again.

01:41.820 --> 01:42.788
I was helping Tori.

01:42.822 --> 01:46.498
Get the gum off my forehead.

01:46.532 --> 01:47.065
All right,

01:47.099 --> 01:48.637
My locker is filled.

01:48.671 --> 01:49.973
I feel complete.

01:50.007 --> 01:51.577
Whoa, whoa, not yet.

01:51.611 --> 01:52.311
What?

01:52.345 --> 01:53.648
You gotta customize it.

01:53.682 --> 01:54.616
Everyone at hollywood arts

01:54.651 --> 01:56.821
Has to customize their locker.

01:57.491 --> 01:59.594
Well, what'd you do for yours?

01:59.628 --> 02:00.863
I made a mosaic using

02:00.897 --> 02:01.965
All of the baby bottle nipples

02:02.000 --> 02:05.773
From my childhood.

02:05.808 --> 02:06.374
They remind me

02:06.408 --> 02:08.612
Of a happier time.

02:08.646 --> 02:09.747
Yours?

02:09.782 --> 02:10.817
Check it out.

02:10.852 --> 02:16.495
Follow those dreads.

02:24.011 --> 02:26.180
Hey, Andre, Robbie!

02:26.215 --> 02:26.816
That squirrel's back

02:26.850 --> 02:28.619
In my office again.

02:28.653 --> 02:29.486
I'll get the net.

02:29.522 --> 02:36.400
I'll get the nuts.

02:36.434 --> 02:36.935
I don't know what to do

02:36.969 --> 02:39.172
With my locker.

02:39.207 --> 02:42.712
Want to see my locker?

02:42.746 --> 02:44.849
I guess.

02:44.883 --> 02:45.950
These are pieces of food

02:45.985 --> 02:46.719
That I chewed,

02:46.753 --> 02:48.655
But never swallowed.

02:48.690 --> 02:50.157
I spit them out, coated them,

02:50.192 --> 02:52.027
With a polyurethane resin

02:52.062 --> 02:52.996
And stuck them on here

02:53.030 --> 02:56.743
With an industrial adhesive.

04:05.573 --> 04:08.209
Betsy, betsy,

04:08.243 --> 04:10.546
That animal's delicious flesh

04:10.580 --> 04:12.415
Can keep us all alive

04:12.450 --> 04:13.850
For another week.

04:13.885 --> 04:15.152
I don't wanna be alive

04:15.187 --> 04:16.452
Without poncy.

04:16.488 --> 04:18.120
This pig is everything to me

04:18.156 --> 04:19.721
That my daddy never was,

04:19.755 --> 04:21.322
And I'll be ding danged.

04:23.392 --> 04:25.159
Sikowitz?

04:25.194 --> 04:25.860
What?

04:25.894 --> 04:26.861
You hit me in the face

04:26.895 --> 04:28.229
With a ball.

04:28.263 --> 04:29.364
Oh, come on,

04:29.398 --> 04:30.431
A truly great actor

04:30.466 --> 04:31.465
Can stay in the scene

04:31.500 --> 04:32.533
No matter what's happening

04:32.568 --> 04:33.234
Around her.

04:33.268 --> 04:34.768
But it really hurts.

04:36.237 --> 04:39.671
Oh, lunch, yay.

04:39.705 --> 04:41.039
Learn your lines.

04:41.073 --> 04:41.839
I want everyone

04:41.874 --> 04:43.641
Off book tomorrow.

04:43.675 --> 04:44.242
Hey, you wanna

04:44.276 --> 04:45.209
Come to lunch with us?

04:45.243 --> 04:49.045
Sure, just lemme...aaah.

04:49.080 --> 04:49.746
What was that for?

04:49.780 --> 04:51.280
I'm not acting right now.

04:51.314 --> 04:52.514
We need to chat.

04:52.548 --> 04:53.648
And "Tori, can I see you?"

04:53.683 --> 04:55.517
Wouldn't have worked?

04:55.551 --> 04:55.950
Have fun.

04:55.985 --> 04:58.787
Protect your face.

04:58.821 --> 04:59.854
What's up?

04:59.889 --> 05:00.755
I hear you signed up

05:00.790 --> 05:01.322
To audition

05:01.356 --> 05:03.590
For a play, "moonlight magic?"

05:04.191 --> 05:04.958
Andre wrote the music for it

05:04.992 --> 05:05.425
And he wants me

05:05.459 --> 05:06.025
To play the lead.

05:06.060 --> 05:06.559
You should.

05:07.194 --> 05:07.760
But you can't?

05:09.629 --> 05:11.596
Not until you pass

05:11.630 --> 05:13.164
"The bird scene."

05:13.198 --> 05:14.198
"The bird scene?"

05:14.232 --> 05:14.932
Here at hollywood arts,

05:14.966 --> 05:15.732
Every student must

05:15.767 --> 05:16.733
Successfully complete

05:16.767 --> 05:17.567
"The bird scene"

05:17.601 --> 05:19.536
Before they can audition for any

05:19.570 --> 05:22.438
And all school productions.

05:22.472 --> 05:23.339
Hey sikowitz,

05:23.373 --> 05:24.306
I forgot to ask you a question

05:24.341 --> 05:25.140
About the homework.

05:25.175 --> 05:25.741
Will we have...?

05:29.445 --> 05:29.978
We'll never know

05:30.012 --> 05:31.493
Her question.

05:47.696 --> 05:48.229
Hey, you know

05:48.263 --> 05:48.896
Where I could buy

05:48.930 --> 05:51.831
A pair of ballet slippers?

05:51.865 --> 05:52.664
No, I don't.

05:52.699 --> 05:53.165
But I know where you can

05:53.199 --> 05:54.033
Get yourself a pretty skirt

05:54.067 --> 05:56.035
And some lip gloss.

05:56.069 --> 05:56.602
Heh, heh, heh.

05:56.636 --> 05:58.269
That was a good one, Beck.

05:58.303 --> 06:02.972
Lip gloss.

06:03.007 --> 06:03.640
Why do you need

06:03.674 --> 06:04.641
Ballet slippers?

06:04.675 --> 06:05.308
'Cause I signed up

06:05.342 --> 06:06.109
For ballet.

06:06.143 --> 06:06.609
Whoa, whoa,

06:06.644 --> 06:08.310
Isn't that kinda girly?

06:08.344 --> 06:09.944
Yep, just one big room

06:09.979 --> 06:12.646
Full of girls, and me.

06:12.680 --> 06:13.313
You guys picking up

06:13.348 --> 06:14.414
What I'm putting down?

06:14.449 --> 06:15.315
I am.

06:15.350 --> 06:18.118
Pretty smooth.

06:18.152 --> 06:19.920
I don't understand.

06:19.954 --> 06:23.590
A lot of girls who dance,

06:23.625 --> 06:28.896
All in one room, with him.

06:32.998 --> 06:33.597
Would you mind

06:33.631 --> 06:35.965
If maybe I signed up too?

06:35.999 --> 06:37.699
Nah, go for it.

06:37.733 --> 06:38.500
How about you, man?

06:38.534 --> 06:39.334
Can't.

06:39.368 --> 06:40.101
Me and Jade already signed up

06:40.136 --> 06:41.469
For salsa dancing.

06:41.503 --> 06:42.937
I can't eat salsa.

06:42.971 --> 06:43.171
Why?

06:43.205 --> 06:43.938
'Cause it hurts your stomach

06:43.972 --> 06:45.106
And gives you nightmares?

06:45.140 --> 06:45.973
No.

06:46.007 --> 06:46.573
Yes.

06:46.608 --> 06:47.107
Maybe.

07:00.387 --> 07:01.086
Ready?

07:01.121 --> 07:02.521
Drive-By acting exercise.

07:02.555 --> 07:04.589
You're all angry englishmen.

07:04.624 --> 07:05.590
Go.

07:05.625 --> 07:07.059
I insist you tell me

07:07.093 --> 07:08.794
Who sat on me crumpet.

07:08.828 --> 07:10.395
My grandmummy went to the loo

07:10.429 --> 07:11.262
While I snogged

07:11.297 --> 07:12.664
The prime minister.

07:12.698 --> 07:13.564
This flock of whipperwils

07:13.599 --> 07:15.433
Is bothering my trousers.

07:15.467 --> 07:16.567
Good heavens,

07:16.601 --> 07:17.601
There's a dead cockroach

07:17.635 --> 07:19.136
In my brassier.

07:19.171 --> 07:20.071
Blimey.

07:20.105 --> 07:20.771
Well, I told you

07:20.805 --> 07:21.705
Not to put plum sauce

07:21.739 --> 07:22.872
On me banger.

07:22.907 --> 07:25.341
You, you, you...

07:25.376 --> 07:27.843
All right, all right,

07:27.877 --> 07:33.082
Very good, quiet down.

07:33.116 --> 07:35.250
Now that we're all

07:35.285 --> 07:37.085
Loosey and/or goosey,

07:37.120 --> 07:38.553
The time has come

07:38.588 --> 07:40.388
For our newest student

07:40.422 --> 07:44.024
To tackle...

07:44.058 --> 07:48.326
The bird scene.

07:48.361 --> 07:49.861
Tori, the stage is yours,

07:49.895 --> 07:52.162
Though you can't take it home.

07:52.197 --> 07:52.829
Can I ask you a few question

07:52.864 --> 07:54.131
Before I start?

07:57.602 --> 07:58.102
So...

07:58.136 --> 07:58.703
Just do your best.

07:58.737 --> 07:59.337
Action.

07:59.372 --> 08:02.607
Okay.

08:02.641 --> 08:03.741
It was 1934

08:03.775 --> 08:05.442
When my husband left me.

08:05.477 --> 08:07.344
Alone, living on the prairie

08:07.378 --> 08:08.779
Was a dreary existence.

08:08.813 --> 08:10.781
No telephone, no radio.

08:10.815 --> 08:12.916
Only a large, majestic bird

08:12.950 --> 08:16.319
With whom I shared my feelings.

08:16.353 --> 08:17.386
One day when I was feeling low,

08:17.421 --> 08:18.521
I said to him,

08:18.555 --> 08:20.822
"Oh bird, you can fly.

08:20.857 --> 08:21.822
"You can soar miles

08:21.856 --> 08:22.654
"From this lonely place,

08:22.688 --> 08:24.187
"Yet you stay.

08:24.222 --> 08:25.519
Why?"

08:25.553 --> 08:26.852
And apparently,

08:26.886 --> 08:27.852
My question rang true,

08:27.887 --> 08:29.353
For that afternoon,

08:29.388 --> 08:30.921
The bird left.

08:30.955 --> 08:39.129
And so went my spirit.

08:39.163 --> 08:40.597
How was that?

08:40.631 --> 08:44.200
What do you mean?

08:44.234 --> 08:45.768
Did I do the scene right?

08:46.536 --> 08:49.071
No, not at all.

08:49.105 --> 08:51.073
Okay, then what'd I do wrong?

08:51.108 --> 08:51.740
You'll have to perform

08:51.775 --> 08:52.674
The scene again tomorrow

08:52.709 --> 08:53.708
And get it right,

08:53.743 --> 08:54.609
Or else you cannot be

08:54.643 --> 08:56.978
In Andre's play or any other.

08:57.012 --> 08:57.545
But can you tell me

08:57.579 --> 08:58.412
What I did wrong?

08:58.446 --> 08:59.346
No, I can't.

08:59.380 --> 09:00.613
I don't get any feedback?

09:00.648 --> 09:01.381
That is correct.

09:01.415 --> 09:01.882
But...

09:01.916 --> 09:03.050
Drive-By acting exercise.

09:03.084 --> 09:05.118
You're all terrified dolphins.

09:05.153 --> 09:08.087
Go.

09:08.122 --> 09:11.123
Live the fear.

09:11.158 --> 09:26.670
Live the fear.

09:26.838 --> 09:28.138
Come on.

09:28.173 --> 09:28.805
How am I supposed to do

09:28.840 --> 09:29.372
The scene right

09:29.407 --> 09:29.940
If no one will tell me

09:29.974 --> 09:30.940
What I did wrong?

09:30.975 --> 09:31.507
I thought you guys

09:31.542 --> 09:32.842
Were my friends.

09:32.876 --> 09:36.778
I'm not your friend.

09:36.813 --> 09:37.345
I was hoping

09:37.380 --> 09:38.947
We could be more than friends.

09:41.049 --> 09:42.382
Uh, it's so gross

09:42.416 --> 09:43.282
How he's always hitting

09:43.316 --> 09:44.249
On every girl.

09:44.284 --> 09:46.117
I never hit on you.

09:46.152 --> 09:48.152
What's that supposed to mean?

09:48.186 --> 09:50.455
You guys...my problem.

09:50.489 --> 09:51.089
Number one rule

09:51.123 --> 09:52.424
Of the bird scene:

09:52.458 --> 09:53.792
Nobody's allowed to help you.

09:53.826 --> 09:56.528
No one.

09:56.562 --> 09:57.763
So this is what you did

09:57.797 --> 09:59.231
With your locker?

09:59.265 --> 09:59.865
Yeah.

09:59.899 --> 10:01.132
See, it's a dry erase board

10:01.167 --> 10:02.166
With a bunch of colorful pens

10:02.201 --> 10:03.100
In a convenient cup.

10:03.134 --> 10:03.967
So whoever wants to,

10:04.001 --> 10:04.634
Can write or draw

10:04.668 --> 10:05.434
Whatever they want.

10:05.469 --> 10:05.968
But you're supposed

10:06.003 --> 10:07.170
To decorate it yourself.

10:07.204 --> 10:07.804
It's a hollywood

10:07.838 --> 10:08.905
Arts tradition.

10:08.939 --> 10:09.806
Well, what's wrong

10:09.840 --> 10:10.473
With letting other people

10:10.507 --> 10:12.008
Be expressive on my locker?

10:12.042 --> 10:12.875
Well, for one thing

10:12.910 --> 10:17.946
They can do that.

10:17.980 --> 10:18.646
Yeah?

10:18.681 --> 10:19.580
Yeah, well my locker's smarter

10:19.615 --> 10:20.881
Than your locker.

10:20.916 --> 10:21.715
How can a locker be...

10:21.750 --> 10:23.850
I don't know.

10:23.885 --> 10:24.951
Oh, come on.

10:24.985 --> 10:25.585
Somebody tell me

10:25.619 --> 10:26.251
How to do the bird scene

10:26.286 --> 10:27.386
Or I'm gonna cry.

10:27.420 --> 10:28.620
Can't.

10:28.655 --> 10:30.155
And don't be so whiny.

10:30.190 --> 10:33.259
Yeah, man up.

10:33.294 --> 10:33.960
Time for our first

10:33.995 --> 10:34.995
Ballet class.

10:35.029 --> 10:41.467
Oh, ballet.

10:50.775 --> 10:51.208
I didn't know

10:51.242 --> 10:51.808
I'd feel so awkward

10:51.843 --> 10:54.277
Wearing tights.

10:54.312 --> 10:55.178
These things squeeze me

10:55.212 --> 10:57.980
In a bad way.

10:58.015 --> 10:58.581
Yeah, you won't

10:58.615 --> 10:59.215
Be complaining

10:59.248 --> 11:00.248
When we're surrounded

11:00.282 --> 11:08.054
By lady ballerinas.

11:08.088 --> 11:12.124
Aw man, it's a dude ranch.

11:27.005 --> 11:28.904
So, you ready?

11:28.939 --> 11:30.539
Oh, I'm way past ready.

11:30.574 --> 11:31.907
Sikowitz wants "the bird scene?"

11:31.941 --> 11:32.541
I'm gonna give him

11:32.575 --> 11:33.341
The bird scene.

11:33.376 --> 11:34.842
I got props, I got a backdrop,

11:34.877 --> 11:35.676
And just to kiss up a little,

11:35.711 --> 11:37.778
I even got sikowitz

11:37.813 --> 11:40.313
Two large coconuts.

11:40.347 --> 11:43.349
Those are good ones.

11:43.383 --> 11:43.849
What's the deal

11:43.883 --> 11:45.550
With sikowitz and coconuts?

11:45.585 --> 11:46.318
He says the milk

11:46.352 --> 11:48.219
Gives him visions.

11:51.256 --> 11:56.926
All right, we're here...

11:56.961 --> 11:59.861
We have much to do today,

11:59.896 --> 12:04.130
But first, Tori, the bird scene.

12:04.165 --> 12:05.264
I'm ready.

12:05.299 --> 12:06.966
And before I begin,

12:07.000 --> 12:07.766
I'd like you to have

12:07.801 --> 12:09.467
These two large coconuts.

12:09.501 --> 12:10.668
Wonderful.

12:10.702 --> 12:11.368
You know, their milk

12:11.402 --> 12:12.435
Gives me visions.

12:12.470 --> 12:14.704
I've heard.

12:14.739 --> 12:15.638
Very good.

12:15.673 --> 12:18.174
Everyone, pay attention.

12:18.208 --> 12:19.175
Tori?

12:19.209 --> 12:24.051
One sec.

12:24.086 --> 12:26.623
Oh, a backdrop!

12:26.657 --> 12:29.859
And I am ready.

12:29.894 --> 12:30.727
Delightful.

12:30.761 --> 12:33.662
Action.

12:33.697 --> 12:34.863
It was 1934

12:34.898 --> 12:36.431
When my husband left me.

12:36.466 --> 12:38.233
Alone, living on the prairie

12:38.267 --> 12:39.868
Was a dreary existence.

12:39.902 --> 12:42.737
No telephone, no radio,

12:42.771 --> 12:48.541
Only a large, majestic bird

12:48.575 --> 12:52.945
With whom I shared my feelings.

12:52.979 --> 12:54.079
One day when I was feeling low,

12:54.114 --> 12:55.147
I said to him,

12:55.181 --> 12:57.782
"Oh bird, you can fly.

12:57.816 --> 12:58.850
"You can soar miles

12:58.884 --> 12:59.684
"From this lonely place,

12:59.718 --> 13:01.018
"Yet you stay.

13:01.053 --> 13:02.753
Why?"

13:02.787 --> 13:04.321
And apparently,

13:04.355 --> 13:05.222
My question rang true,

13:05.256 --> 13:06.689
For that afternoon,

13:06.724 --> 13:14.162
The bird left.

13:14.197 --> 13:19.567
And so went my spirit.

13:19.601 --> 13:23.270
So, was that good?

13:23.304 --> 13:24.104
Exactly what are you

13:24.138 --> 13:27.540
Asking me?

13:27.574 --> 13:28.340
You know, did you like

13:28.375 --> 13:29.208
What I did with the scene?

13:29.242 --> 13:30.175
Sure.

13:30.210 --> 13:31.944
So did I get it right?

13:31.978 --> 13:35.980
Oh no, you failed, again.

13:36.015 --> 13:36.748
What? Why?

13:36.782 --> 13:37.448
I did everything...

13:37.483 --> 13:38.649
Hey, watch!

13:38.684 --> 13:42.719
Where you throw your props.

13:55.331 --> 13:56.397
Cat!

13:56.432 --> 13:57.498
Hey!

13:57.532 --> 13:59.633
You have to try something.

13:59.667 --> 14:00.867
Handcuffs?

14:00.901 --> 14:02.702
Huh, put 'em on one wrist.

14:02.736 --> 14:04.870
Okay.

14:04.905 --> 14:05.838
Good, and now we lock

14:05.872 --> 14:08.073
The other part around here.

14:08.108 --> 14:10.643
Fun.

14:10.677 --> 14:11.611
Okay, now try these.

14:11.645 --> 14:15.213
Ah, candy!

14:15.248 --> 14:18.349
Mmmm, these are so...

14:18.383 --> 14:20.651
So hot, what are these?

14:20.685 --> 14:21.452
Choo-Choo peppers.

14:22.754 --> 14:23.920
They're burning my mouth.

14:23.955 --> 14:24.454
I know.

14:24.489 --> 14:25.121
You want some water?

14:25.156 --> 14:25.689
Yes.

14:25.723 --> 14:26.323
Tell me the secret

14:26.357 --> 14:26.856
Of the bird scene.

14:26.891 --> 14:29.159
I can't, and I need water.

14:29.193 --> 14:33.496
Oh, fine.

14:33.530 --> 14:34.230
Wait, Tori!

14:34.264 --> 14:40.768
Water.

14:40.802 --> 14:43.070
Whatcha doing?

14:43.104 --> 14:43.870
Angrily throwing books

14:43.905 --> 14:46.673
In my locker, can't you tell?

14:46.707 --> 14:47.173
So did you figure out

14:47.208 --> 14:47.541
How you're gonna

14:47.575 --> 14:48.675
Decorate it yet?

14:48.710 --> 14:49.510
Yes, look,

14:49.544 --> 14:50.878
I put a stripe on it.

14:50.912 --> 14:52.512
Did you see the stripe?

14:52.547 --> 14:54.781
I see the stripe.

14:54.815 --> 14:55.347
Well, I don't know

14:55.382 --> 14:56.115
What to do.

14:56.149 --> 14:57.382
Why don't you do something,

14:57.416 --> 14:59.484
You know, creative and deep?

14:59.518 --> 15:00.651
What'd you do for yours?

15:00.686 --> 15:09.059
Come on.

15:09.093 --> 15:09.959
Clear?

15:09.994 --> 15:11.527
Transparent.

15:11.561 --> 15:12.527
I've got no secrets

15:12.562 --> 15:15.262
And neither does my locker.

15:15.297 --> 15:16.163
Aw, that is creative

15:16.197 --> 15:17.497
And deep.

15:17.531 --> 15:19.398
Yeah.

15:19.433 --> 15:21.200
So, anyway...

15:21.234 --> 15:23.168
About the bird scene.

15:23.202 --> 15:24.169
Later.

15:27.540 --> 15:29.209
Hey, Trina, can you help me?

15:29.243 --> 15:29.509
I'm...

15:29.543 --> 15:30.376
Sorry, gotta get to lunch

15:30.410 --> 15:34.714
Before they run out of paninis.

15:39.754 --> 15:42.222
Man, this is humiliating.

15:42.256 --> 15:42.989
Agreed.

15:43.024 --> 15:43.590
I can't believe

15:43.624 --> 15:46.826
You got us into this.

15:46.860 --> 15:49.895
Let's get outta this.

15:49.929 --> 15:51.296
Madame makee?

15:51.330 --> 15:51.963
Oui?

15:51.998 --> 15:52.464
We're gonna

15:52.498 --> 15:54.032
Have to drop this class.

15:54.066 --> 15:54.799
If you drop this class

15:54.833 --> 15:55.566
Then it goes on your

15:55.600 --> 15:58.102
Permanent record as a zehro.

15:58.136 --> 15:58.702
Oh c'mon,

15:58.736 --> 16:01.137
You can't give us a "zehro."

16:01.172 --> 16:01.671
Why do you want

16:01.706 --> 16:02.805
To drop zis class?

16:02.840 --> 16:03.873
Look around, woman.

16:03.907 --> 16:04.407
We're surrounded

16:04.441 --> 16:07.709
By dudes in tights.

16:07.744 --> 16:10.946
It's just gross.

16:10.980 --> 16:12.914
Hey, sorry I'm late.

16:12.948 --> 16:28.228
Girl.

16:28.262 --> 16:28.628
Hey, Robbie!

16:29.464 --> 16:30.063
Hi, Rex!

16:30.431 --> 16:31.431
What's doin'?

16:31.465 --> 16:33.166
Did you guys quit ballet?

16:33.200 --> 16:33.799
We can't,

16:33.834 --> 16:36.434
Unless we want a "zehro."

16:37.603 --> 16:38.536
Well, I'm sorry

16:38.570 --> 16:40.771
You're feeling stressed.

16:40.805 --> 16:42.639
Ohhh, it's okay.

16:42.674 --> 16:44.474
I'm sure we'll...

16:44.508 --> 16:45.374
I'm sure we can...

16:45.409 --> 16:46.542
Would you keep doing that,

16:46.576 --> 16:47.910
Please?

16:47.944 --> 16:49.244
Sure.

16:49.278 --> 16:51.079
This is getting weird.

16:52.348 --> 16:53.514
Hey, you know what's making me

16:53.549 --> 16:54.549
Feel stressed?

16:54.583 --> 16:56.550
Tell me, I'll kill it.

16:56.584 --> 16:57.051
It's this whole

16:57.085 --> 16:58.118
Bird scene thing.

16:58.152 --> 16:59.019
Ah, there it is:

16:59.053 --> 17:00.586
The ulterior motive.

17:00.620 --> 17:01.353
Hush, puppet.

17:01.387 --> 17:01.920
Mmhm-Mmh-Mmhm-Mmh.

17:01.955 --> 17:02.587
You'll help me

17:02.622 --> 17:04.122
With the bird scene, won't you?

17:04.156 --> 17:05.323
I'm really not supposed to...

17:05.357 --> 17:07.223
Ow, he bit my hand.

17:07.258 --> 17:07.991
Rex.

17:08.026 --> 17:08.959
Take me to the bathroom.

17:08.992 --> 17:12.797
I gotta pee now.

17:12.832 --> 17:13.531
He's a puppet.

17:13.566 --> 17:14.397
He can't pee.

17:14.433 --> 17:19.268
You don't know what I got.

17:25.442 --> 17:27.342
All right, class.

17:27.377 --> 17:29.477
All right.

17:29.512 --> 17:31.347
Which dancers would like

17:31.381 --> 17:32.448
To show me the routine

17:32.482 --> 17:33.983
We were working on last time?

17:34.017 --> 17:35.017
We would.

17:35.051 --> 17:36.251
What?

17:36.285 --> 17:37.219
We got this, man.

17:37.253 --> 17:38.919
You're a maniac.

17:38.954 --> 17:46.258
Andre, Robbie, to the front.

17:46.292 --> 17:46.858
Don't talk to anyone

17:46.893 --> 17:50.996
Till I get back.

17:51.030 --> 17:54.700
Positions.

17:54.734 --> 17:56.234
Begin.

18:26.528 --> 18:27.194
Let's take

18:27.228 --> 18:29.395
A five minute break.

18:29.429 --> 18:30.729
Please make it 10.

18:30.763 --> 18:32.063
20.

18:53.352 --> 18:55.119
Happy birthday.

18:55.153 --> 18:56.420
Who's birthday is it?

18:56.454 --> 18:58.989
Somebody's, somewhere.

18:59.023 --> 19:01.558
That's so true.

19:01.592 --> 19:02.826
Where is Tori?

19:02.860 --> 19:04.060
Here.

19:04.094 --> 19:06.829
Oh... you brought curtains.

19:06.863 --> 19:07.730
Let's do this.

19:07.764 --> 19:08.498
Very good.

19:08.532 --> 19:09.399
Ladies and gentlemen,

19:09.433 --> 19:10.166
Once again:

19:10.201 --> 19:13.035
"The bird scene" starring Tori.

19:13.070 --> 19:13.603
Vega.

19:13.637 --> 19:23.411
Vega.

19:23.445 --> 19:24.612
It was 1934

19:24.646 --> 19:26.413
When my husband left me.

19:26.448 --> 19:28.515
Alone, living on the prairie

19:28.550 --> 19:30.250
Was a dreary existence.

19:30.284 --> 19:32.652
No telephone, no radio,

19:32.686 --> 19:34.353
Only a large, majestic bird

19:34.388 --> 19:36.422
With whom I shared my feelings.

19:41.995 --> 19:44.163
You see the bird too, right?

19:44.197 --> 19:44.730
Yeah.

19:44.764 --> 19:47.065
Fantastic.

19:47.100 --> 19:47.532
One day,

19:47.567 --> 19:48.233
When I was feeling low,

19:48.267 --> 19:49.534
I said to him,

19:49.568 --> 19:52.336
"Oh bird, you can fly.

19:52.370 --> 19:53.303
You can soar miles

19:53.338 --> 19:54.204
From this lonely place,

19:54.238 --> 19:55.772
Yet you stay.

19:55.806 --> 20:00.643
Why?"

20:00.678 --> 20:01.344
And apparently

20:01.378 --> 20:03.079
My question rang true,

20:03.113 --> 20:05.280
For that afternoon my bird left,

20:05.315 --> 20:10.451
And so went my spirit.

20:10.485 --> 20:13.654
That was impressive.

20:13.688 --> 20:14.888
So did I get it right?

20:14.923 --> 20:18.091
Nope.

20:18.125 --> 20:19.926
But I just...

20:19.960 --> 20:22.461
I'd...I did too get it right.

20:22.495 --> 20:23.261
Tori, listen.

20:23.296 --> 20:23.762
I'm not trying

20:23.796 --> 20:24.462
To be disrespectful.

20:24.496 --> 20:25.363
But, you know, how hard

20:25.397 --> 20:26.630
I worked on this scene?

20:26.664 --> 20:28.198
I made this costume.

20:28.232 --> 20:28.798
I downloaded

20:28.832 --> 20:29.665
Special prairie music.

20:29.699 --> 20:30.399
I even trained

20:30.433 --> 20:31.600
That crazy cockatoo to fly

20:31.634 --> 20:32.434
In and out of that window

20:32.468 --> 20:33.835
On command.

20:33.869 --> 20:36.204
Not now.

20:36.238 --> 20:37.104
Look, I know

20:37.139 --> 20:38.072
You're a great acting teacher

20:38.106 --> 20:38.539
And everything,

20:38.573 --> 20:40.207
But I don't care what you say.

20:40.241 --> 20:42.108
The scene I just did was good,

20:42.143 --> 20:42.809
And I'm proud of it

20:42.844 --> 20:54.152
No matter what anybody thinks.

20:54.186 --> 20:55.053
What?

20:55.087 --> 20:55.987
You just passed

20:56.021 --> 20:57.555
"The bird scene."

21:01.226 --> 21:02.226
But you said...

21:02.260 --> 21:03.694
Tori, the whole point

21:03.728 --> 21:04.728
Of the bird scene

21:04.762 --> 21:06.129
Is to teach a performer,

21:06.164 --> 21:07.197
Like yourself,

21:07.231 --> 21:09.933
To believe in your own choices

21:09.967 --> 21:12.301
No matter what others think.

21:12.335 --> 21:13.602
We are artists,

21:13.637 --> 21:14.870
And a true artist

21:14.904 --> 21:16.738
Does not define success

21:16.773 --> 21:19.274
Based on hu, hee, hee approval

21:19.308 --> 21:20.008
From others.

21:20.042 --> 21:21.509
A true artist need

21:21.543 --> 21:23.243
Only please himself

21:23.278 --> 21:29.249
Or herself or itself.

21:29.284 --> 21:34.354
You don't know what I got.

21:34.388 --> 21:35.922
So, all three times

21:35.956 --> 21:36.823
I did the scene...

21:36.857 --> 21:38.791
...were delightful.

21:38.825 --> 21:40.125
It was only wrong

21:40.160 --> 21:43.528
When you asked if it was right.

21:45.064 --> 21:46.297
Drive-By acting exercise.

21:46.332 --> 21:47.131
You're all elderly people

21:47.166 --> 21:47.865
Walking barefoot

21:47.900 --> 21:49.100
On broken glass.

21:49.134 --> 21:50.334
Go.

22:12.154 --> 22:13.655
You guys ready?

22:14.156 --> 22:16.358
Whatever.

22:19.392 --> 22:21.593
Make what shine?

22:21.627 --> 22:22.560
It's the title of the song

22:22.594 --> 22:24.562
I sang in the big showcase.

22:24.596 --> 22:25.429
Okay.

22:25.463 --> 22:26.997
Whatever.

22:27.031 --> 22:27.597
'Cause you know,

22:27.632 --> 22:28.298
That's what got me here

22:28.332 --> 22:29.666
In the first place.

22:29.700 --> 22:30.967
I don't like it.

22:31.001 --> 22:31.601
Maybe the words

22:31.635 --> 22:32.334
Should be bigger.

22:32.368 --> 22:35.936
Yes.

22:37.438 --> 22:38.838
I believe in my own choice,

22:38.872 --> 22:39.838
And I don't need approval

22:39.873 --> 22:40.906
From others.

22:40.940 --> 22:42.173
Ah, the young female

22:42.207 --> 22:43.074
Has learned the ways

22:43.108 --> 22:45.143
Of "the bird scene."

22:45.177 --> 22:46.645
I still think it's dull.

22:46.679 --> 22:47.712
Yeah?

22:47.747 --> 22:48.313
Well, then maybe

22:48.347 --> 22:52.883
I should make it shine.

22:54.285 --> 22:54.985
Nice!

22:55.019 --> 22:56.219
Light-Y.

22:56.253 --> 22:56.920
Okay, are we going to eat

22:56.921 --> 22:57.587
Or what?

22:57.621 --> 23:00.022
Oh, yay, food.

23:00.057 --> 23:01.157
Come with?

23:01.191 --> 23:07.028
Sure.
