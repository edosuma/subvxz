WEBVTT

00:07.552 --> 00:11.295
This is Venice pier on
California's coastline, and

00:11.503 --> 00:15.570
today, Venice Beach will serve
as the starting line for an all

00:15.771 --> 00:19.153
new season of
The Amazing Race.

00:21.430 --> 00:25.364
Here we go! We are on
The Amazing Race. -Let's go!

00:25.915 --> 00:28.083
We're such a big fans
of The Amazing Race.

00:28.184 --> 00:30.631
I created a fake
online edition of the race.

00:30.766 --> 00:34.058
I hired a camera guy, I created
fictional Roadblocks, Detours.

00:34.166 --> 00:37.318
Through 6 states, over
8000km, 2 countries,

00:37.419 --> 00:40.707
and we ended up under aurora borealis.

00:40.942 --> 00:43.964
Justin proposed to me under aurora
borealis lights, and I said yes.

00:44.172 --> 00:47.728
After putting the proposal on the
internet, it became a viral sensation.

00:47.936 --> 00:51.709
It caught the attention of BuzzFeed,
it was on AOL, MSN, Yahoo.

00:51.917 --> 00:54.826
For that to work out and
then lead to where it's led,

00:54.927 --> 00:57.290
it's truly like a dream come true.

00:58.386 --> 01:01.466
There's definitely some attractive
females here for sure, on the race.

01:01.567 --> 01:04.668
We are certainly planning
on using flirtation as a strategy.

01:04.803 --> 01:06.747
It's one of our actually
part of a bigger strategies.

01:06.955 --> 01:09.158
We're good talking to girls and
think they're going to go for the

01:09.259 --> 01:11.266
southern Texas charm.

01:11.397 --> 01:13.777
Throughout the four years of college, we
had some runs on the same girls.

01:13.985 --> 01:19.263
Even though I'm 1.90, and he's
like 1.80 with hair. -His game is terrible.

01:20.384 --> 01:23.799
Alex and I, we have a form of
dwarfism, called pseudoachondroplasia.

01:24.007 --> 01:26.451
I don't ever really look myself
having a disandvantage.

01:26.559 --> 01:30.152
I mean, I wrestled all throughout a high
school, and made the state few times.

01:30.360 --> 01:34.357
In a high school, I was the theather
kid. Choir, show choir, jazz choir.

01:34.565 --> 01:36.717
We could be the sleeper team.
Sneak right pass everybody,

01:36.818 --> 01:38.955
and then have that million
dollars in our pocket. -Yeah.

01:39.183 --> 01:44.192
I'm Cindy Chac, and I'm general dentist.
-I'm Rick Chac, and I'm obstetrician gynecologist.

01:44.400 --> 01:48.930
As doctors, being calm, cool, collected
under pressure is very very important.

01:49.138 --> 01:53.268
We're smart, we're athletic,
and we work well as a team.

01:53.476 --> 01:57.328
So, for the other teams, watch out,
team Chacattack is gonna come.

01:58.136 --> 02:00.468
We have been best friends
forever. I was the single mom.

02:00.676 --> 02:04.227
We were close most of my
childhood, but her reaction on my

02:04.328 --> 02:06.725
coming out was not... ideal.

02:06.933 --> 02:08.961
Your mom is the one who is supposed
to love you unconditionally.

02:09.062 --> 02:12.663
So, it was awful. We didn't talk
for quite a long time after that.

02:12.792 --> 02:15.975
She has grown so much
as I first came out,

02:16.076 --> 02:18.206
I still think there's a
little bit room to go.

02:18.245 --> 02:20.821
I used to be his hero, and I
feel like I'm not his hero anymore.

02:20.922 --> 02:24.836
But maybe, after this race, or during
the race, I will be your hero again.

02:27.417 --> 02:31.462
We both ran track at the U.C. Riverside.
I broke a school record at hepthatlon.

02:31.671 --> 02:35.401
And then she did it. -I'm cheerleader,
I broke the school record at hepthatlon.

02:35.609 --> 02:37.635
Dream team, baby.
-Dream team!

02:38.250 --> 02:42.979
I'm Logan, this is my boyfriend Chris,
we got pretty crazy job, we're paparazzi.

02:43.187 --> 02:46.757
We're not celebrity obsessed by
nature, we're actually photographers.

02:46.965 --> 02:50.792
We never pictured ourselves doing this.
Whatever we were doing wasn't

02:50.893 --> 02:54.002
paying the rent, untill we shot
a couple of celebs on the beach

02:54.103 --> 02:56.411
and we started to realize that
this might be way to go. -Yeah.

02:56.481 --> 02:59.121
We were chasing Justin Bieber
around just a couple days ago,

02:59.222 --> 03:01.744
and now we're chasing Phil around
the world. We're gonna find him first,

03:01.845 --> 03:03.932
just like we do it at
home in Miami. -Exactly.

03:05.238 --> 03:08.862
I'm from Staten Island.
-I'm from Jersey!

03:09.922 --> 03:14.132
Krista and I are former NFL cheerleaders.
-There's a big stereotype,

03:14.340 --> 03:17.392
when you're from Jersey, and you're
from New York, and I'm a cheerleader,

03:17.600 --> 03:20.078
but I have a masters degree
in speech pathologist.

03:20.286 --> 03:23.113
I'm currently a
consultant for physician in healthcare.

03:23.214 --> 03:26.480
So let's the hair, make up...
-Don't let it fool you.

03:27.586 --> 03:32.419
Welcome to a very early morning start on
what might be the hippest beach in America.

03:32.627 --> 03:36.513
As you can see, we have a
number of Amazing Race fans here.

03:38.953 --> 03:42.434
We have some ex amazing racers.
Rob and Brennan.

03:42.642 --> 03:47.453
The first winners of The Amazing Race, the
first team to win 1 million dollars is here.

03:48.140 --> 03:52.257
How about I tell you all, the
name of your first destination?

03:54.111 --> 03:58.933
What's the name of the place? -Rio!
-That's right, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil!

03:59.034 --> 04:01.058
What do you think about that?

04:03.629 --> 04:07.579
When i say go, you're gonna
catch a cab to Mothers Beach,

04:07.787 --> 04:11.461
and then you're going to go
head to head in a bike race.

04:11.669 --> 04:17.261
The team that wins that bike
race, will win the one and only

04:17.469 --> 04:20.802
ticket on the first flight to Rio.

04:22.229 --> 04:26.967
Yes you heard me right, there is only
one ticket on the first flight to Rio.

04:27.175 --> 04:31.462
The 2nd flight leaves
30 minutes later.

04:31.899 --> 04:35.729
Don't forget to pick up your
backpacks, and your Fitbit Charges,

04:36.120 --> 04:39.401
because we gonna be monitoring
your activity throughout the race.

04:39.609 --> 04:44.197
Now, if you're not motivated enough, the
team that wins this first leg of the race,

04:44.298 --> 04:46.518
will win the Express Pass.

04:46.815 --> 04:49.932
Are you wait it long enough?
The world is waiting for you!

04:50.542 --> 04:53.811
Good luck!
Travel safe!

04:57.715 --> 04:59.758
Go!

05:05.997 --> 05:10.204
Mother's Beach? -As quick as you can, please.
-Don't be a gentleman, just jump in the car.

05:10.346 --> 05:14.529
Oh my God. -God! Don't
let them pass you, please!

05:16.029 --> 05:20.647
Good job. -Look! I can't control the
adrenaline, just makes me shake.

05:20.855 --> 05:24.806
We started The Amazing Race.
-We're going to Rio, Brazil!

05:25.014 --> 05:27.252
Can't wait to see those men.

05:27.460 --> 05:30.897
Hi everybody, thanks so much for joining us
here on The Amazing Race, I'm Joey Buttitta.

05:31.105 --> 05:35.052
I'm Kelsey Gerckens, and we're headed to
Rio de Janeiro. -Oh, it's gonna be awesome.

05:35.260 --> 05:37.595
We are news anchors from
southern part of California.

05:37.803 --> 05:43.586
I anchor the morning news casts.
-I am a major reporter from Ventura County.

05:43.794 --> 05:46.713
We are also dating.
-It has been a year and a half.

05:46.921 --> 05:49.837
So, The Amazing Race, I can
consider it like a master test

05:49.938 --> 05:54.002
to see if this is something we should
tie up and love each other forever.

05:54.037 --> 05:57.533
I think I'm just nervous. -Don't
be nervous, we got this, we're smart.

05:58.037 --> 06:02.011
It's just... We just sitting in chair
and talking smack on people.

06:02.219 --> 06:07.908
We work at TMZ, which is a gossip TV show
and website that covers celebrity news.

06:08.116 --> 06:13.731
So anything you're thinking about whatever's
happening, Caitlin Jenner, the Kardashians,

06:14.332 --> 06:17.109
the Royal Family, we just keep
to say out loud to everyone.

06:17.317 --> 06:21.853
We're truth tellers. -Sometimes it's little
mean-spirited, sometimes, that's okay.

06:22.061 --> 06:26.491
Now we're running ang talking smack on
people. -We have to run, and do attack.

06:26.692 --> 06:28.751
Then talking smack on people.

06:28.886 --> 06:31.778
One ticket on the first flight to
Rio that is 30 minutes earlier.

06:31.986 --> 06:35.456
So only one team will have a 30-minute
advantage over all the other teams.

06:35.706 --> 06:37.903
We need the Express Pass,
it's really important.

06:38.023 --> 06:41.565
The life is on the line right now. Quite
people here, are going to get eliminated,

06:41.666 --> 06:46.254
they get to go back home. We get eliminated,
there's no home to get back to, so...

06:46.462 --> 06:49.866
Right now, I'm sleeping at my car.
-Rolling up, it wasn't so good,

06:49.967 --> 06:52.003
that's when we started dancing.

06:52.097 --> 06:55.152
Doing street performances, and
that's kind of how we made money.

06:55.253 --> 06:57.334
to put food in our stomach,
to put clothes on your back.

06:57.412 --> 07:01.096
We came here to win, to win our lives.
They say 'Go hard or go home',

07:01.197 --> 07:02.871
and we don't have a home.

07:02.906 --> 07:05.539
A bike ride, what's that?
Those are boats, not a bike.

07:05.747 --> 07:09.178
Oh my God, these are bikes.
-Water bikes? -Yes. -Oh, we got this.

07:09.279 --> 07:11.104
Yep, those are water bikes.

07:16.378 --> 07:18.996
Go, Tiff, go! -Push! Push!

07:19.521 --> 07:21.753
Get on, Logan. Go, go, go.

07:21.961 --> 07:25.464
Justin, you're not ain't far enough.
-Go! -You're not ain't far enough.

07:28.589 --> 07:31.884
Oh, my God!
This is crazy already!

07:32.516 --> 07:37.584
We have beaten by cheerleaders. -Who
says cheerleaders aren't athletic, right?

07:37.792 --> 07:43.341
It's like training on the bike at the gym.
-We're on The Amazing Race! Yep,we are.This is crazy!

07:43.663 --> 07:45.582
Push, push.

07:47.323 --> 07:48.929
Come on, don't stop,
don't stop. Come on.

07:48.964 --> 07:51.932
My legs hurt so bad!
-I see the (?) there.

07:52.140 --> 07:54.322
You see any race flags?

07:55.225 --> 07:59.628
No. -It just broke! -Dude, I would
tow you but you guys are beefcakes.

08:00.529 --> 08:04.405
It broke.
-See you at the finish line.

08:11.094 --> 08:17.654
<b>The Amazing Race, Seasone 27
Episode 1: "A Little Too Much Beefcake"

08:19.000 --> 08:25.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

08:54.429 --> 08:57.721
Across the harbor.
You see the yellow flag?

08:58.122 --> 09:02.104
I think that's it. -Pump it, pump it,
we've got this. Come on, you can do it.

09:02.312 --> 09:04.923
We're gonna get on the first
flight, baby. We're gonna do it.

09:05.131 --> 09:09.225
What steers it? -Go, I steer it, go.
-You guys okay? -It broke.

09:09.433 --> 09:12.349
Pedaling too fast?
-We're coming, Phil!

09:12.886 --> 09:17.026
Go, go! Come on, come on.
-Come on, baby. Come on!

09:17.953 --> 09:22.369
Let's go. -Come on,
Justin! I see Phil! -Yes, yes!

09:23.268 --> 09:25.331
Congratulations to you, guys!

09:25.432 --> 09:29.488
You are the one and only team
that will be on the first flight to Rio!

09:29.863 --> 09:33.405
There you go. -Oh my God!
-Come on, guys, bring it in.

09:34.006 --> 09:37.136
Nice work, nice work.
-2nd place (?) though.

09:37.344 --> 09:40.075
Careful. Don't fall!

09:45.181 --> 09:47.401
Go, just go.

09:48.665 --> 09:51.404
Congratulations guys, you're on
your way to Rio. -Thank you, Phil!

09:52.252 --> 09:55.132
Good job. Congratulations,
you're on your way to Rio.

09:55.433 --> 09:58.799
All right, good job, guys. Would you
guys like to go to Rio? -Uh, yeah.

09:58.900 --> 10:00.486
We gotta go to Rio!

10:00.521 --> 10:03.636
Being in the first flight is great,
30 minutes ahead, it's huge.

10:03.844 --> 10:07.067
We just gotta get to the Pitstop, we
need that Express Pass, it's everything.

10:07.275 --> 10:10.799
Two beefcakes next to us are a little too
much beefcake, and not enough finesse.

10:11.007 --> 10:15.030
What did you do, did you just like, did your
muscles break the boat? What did you do?

10:15.238 --> 10:17.703
I guess we didn't know... -How to ride.

10:20.513 --> 10:23.308
We know we're gonna have half
hour lead. I want the Express Pass.

10:23.516 --> 10:26.898
We're going for the Express Pass. Let them
strategize all they want for the 2nd place.

10:27.099 --> 10:29.248
We're getting in
the first place in this leg.

10:30.673 --> 10:33.717
Hey, friends, can we join you?
-Yes. -Sweet.

10:33.752 --> 10:36.841
Kelly and I are very judgmental.
I can judge anyone for anything.

10:37.049 --> 10:42.253
The pink team is like a little bit
Norman Bates... and his mother.

10:42.461 --> 10:46.701
I'm Kelly. -I'm Tanner. -The two guys
definitely bro's a fist bumping a lot.

10:46.902 --> 10:51.050
A lot fist bumping. -Lot fist bumping!
-We look good. -Keep your hair down.

10:51.451 --> 10:55.319
The cheerleaders are very primpy.
-I have lot of questions about...

10:55.690 --> 10:59.140
Her primping process.
-Rio!

10:59.348 --> 11:04.196
I think people are here to look good,
versus to do good, in the competition.

11:04.580 --> 11:07.224
We go to Rio...
-De Janeiro!

11:07.432 --> 11:09.774
We're on the 2nd flight, but,
we're actually kind of happy about it,

11:09.975 --> 11:12.613
because, there are
10 teams on this flight,

11:12.684 --> 11:15.936
and the other flight is only a half hour ahead of us.
And they are all by themselves.

11:16.337 --> 11:19.643
So if anything goes wrong,
they're the one to get in trouble.

11:19.851 --> 11:22.819
We feel we're a little bit behind even
though we're on the same flight, but...

11:23.035 --> 11:25.921
It's time to get our game, faces on.
Okay? -We'll get it. -Let's go.

11:29.017 --> 11:33.661
<i>Teams are now flying 9000km
from North America to South America,</i>

11:33.869 --> 11:36.462
<i>and the city of
Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.</i>

11:36.670 --> 11:39.721
<i>When they land, they must
make their way to the Lagoa helipad,</i>

11:39.822 --> 11:42.660
<i>and sign up for a
helicopter ride over Rio.</i>

11:59.240 --> 12:03.167
The other teams. -Where you see that?
-Right there! -Taxi, taxi.

12:03.827 --> 12:07.574
Taxi! The other teams lended already,
so we have to get out of this airport

12:07.675 --> 12:11.328
and get to the helipad as fast as
posible, to maintain some sort of lead.

12:11.463 --> 12:14.008
It's a little nerve wracking
to see some other teams.

12:14.442 --> 12:17.090
Especially when you thought
you had a 30 minutes lead.

12:17.298 --> 12:19.617
I don't care if we get to the mat
one second before other teams,

12:19.718 --> 12:21.535
as long as we get that Express Pass.

12:21.570 --> 12:24.673
We're in Brazil right now.
And it's about to go down.

12:24.939 --> 12:29.451
Go. -We're next. -Thank you, thank you.
-Can we go to Lagoa helipad, please?

12:30.169 --> 12:34.928
Oh my gosh, its gorgeous. -I know.
-Wow, look at this skyline!

12:35.136 --> 12:38.896
You're rockstar, Fred. -Rockstar,
you know what that is, Fred?

12:38.997 --> 12:45.233
Woop woop. -You like that woop woop today.
-I do like that woop woop. -You like that, Fred? -What?

12:46.990 --> 12:52.142
Oh my God, look at this, dude!
-Whoa, have you ever seen this?

12:52.350 --> 12:57.152
Wow, this is insane. -What?
-Yeah, this is like, the hood of Brazil.

12:57.820 --> 13:02.391
This looks like a projects, (?).
-Yeah, this is defenitely the ghetto.

13:02.828 --> 13:07.152
Favela (?). -Favela?
Oh, wow. That's crazy.

13:09.404 --> 13:13.147
All right. This looks like the place.
Oh, there are helicopters.

13:13.327 --> 13:20.258
Oh, Fast Forward. -Make your way to "Clube
Sao Conrado de Voo", in San Cornado Beach,

13:20.466 --> 13:24.178
for the chance to soar above Rio, on the
hand glider, and earn Fast Forward.

13:24.386 --> 13:26.587
Warning: the Fast Forward
is weather depended.

13:26.688 --> 13:28.769
We will take the Fast Forward,
we'll take a chance.

13:29.152 --> 13:32.738
Here. Hey, we're 2nd here!

13:32.946 --> 13:36.107
We caught up with the dream team. -You
never know when to take a Fast Forward,

13:36.208 --> 13:38.719
but when you're in the lead,
and you have team right behind you,

13:38.820 --> 13:41.755
just do it, just get the lead. -Wanna
do the Fast Forward or not? -Oh.

13:41.990 --> 13:43.001
Weather depended.

13:43.095 --> 13:46.170
The weather looks fine, could
be different on top, but...

13:46.471 --> 13:49.244
I hope this works out.
-Fast Forward is too risky.

13:49.452 --> 13:52.958
It is risky, let's not do that,
we just gonna do the... Road info.

13:53.359 --> 13:58.275
<i>Teams will now take a helicopter trip,
featuring a view of Brazil's iconic landmark</i>

13:58.483 --> 14:02.216
<i>Christ the Redeemer,
also known as "Cristo Redentor".</i>

14:02.757 --> 14:06.455
<i>When they land, they must correctly
answer the heliport's manager question,</i>

14:06.663 --> 14:09.271
<i>about what they've seen
to receive their next clue.</i>

14:09.479 --> 14:11.795
Route Info, Fast Forward. I don't think
we should do the Fast Forward. -Okay.

14:11.803 --> 14:14.201
Team four (?) that's big time.

14:14.409 --> 14:19.221
Oh my gosh! We're in helicopter! We're gonna
fly over the Rio De Janeiro we have to pay atention!

14:19.429 --> 14:22.235
Because... they're gonna
ask us a question at the end.

14:22.443 --> 14:25.890
Fast Forward! -They already got it,
I'm pretty sure. -(No) Fast Forward.

14:26.098 --> 14:28.217
Skip the Fast Forward,
we're too late for it. -Okay.

14:28.318 --> 14:30.953
I'm not good at highs, I don't want to
do a hang gliding competition. -Yea.

14:31.308 --> 14:34.893
What's the Fast Forward?
-They already took it(?). -Okay. Let's go.

14:36.686 --> 14:40.253
They're gonna ask us a question, I don't
know what question they're gong to ask us.

14:40.454 --> 14:43.992
It's so gorgeous.
-This is so amazing, oh my God.

14:44.127 --> 14:47.753
So many things to look at.
Let's pay attention to the obvious.

14:49.055 --> 14:52.737
Oh, I'm so excited!
-I know! -Oh my God!

14:44.127 --> 14:47.753
Many things to look at.
Let's pay attention to the obvious.

14:49.055 --> 14:52.737
Oh, I'm so excited!
-I know! -Oh my God!

14:52.805 --> 14:58.569
This is so cool. It's beautiful.
-Yes, it's beautiful. -Look at that.

14:59.599 --> 15:03.497
Oh, it's so beautiful. -Are you looking?
-Baby, I am looking.

15:03.705 --> 15:05.636
I'm nervous.
-I'm excited.

15:05.771 --> 15:09.025
and what better place to have our first
helicopter ride over Rio de Janeiro.

15:09.233 --> 15:13.565
We got a lot behind us. -How did we get
behind everybody? -Bad taxi driver, I guess.

15:13.773 --> 15:16.889
We're not last.
-Second from last.

15:17.520 --> 15:21.660
We're last one.
-What the hell happened?

15:22.232 --> 15:26.096
You just have to think positive,
you know that everything can happen.

15:28.370 --> 15:33.218
So we're gonna go hand gliding. -Oh my God!
-This will take us right to the Pitstop, so,

15:33.426 --> 15:35.583
if we get this done,
we get the Express Pass.

15:35.791 --> 15:38.623
It's unbelievable feeling
to finally be on the race,

15:38.724 --> 15:41.598
(So being in) fake race is nothing compared to this.
-Oh my gosh, no.

15:47.796 --> 15:50.287
We're here, Sao Conrado.
How are you?

15:50.495 --> 15:53.110
Hi, I'm gonna be your pilot.
Welcome to the club.

15:53.211 --> 15:55.214
Thank you, the weather?
-But only one problem... -What?

15:55.349 --> 15:57.377
The wind is not so good.

16:02.029 --> 16:06.856
How long, do you... -Just God knows.
-Could be 10 minutes, could be hour?

16:06.957 --> 16:08.189
Maybe more.

16:08.396 --> 16:12.684
We're the professional, what do you think?
-We cannot fly. -Today? -Yes.

16:12.892 --> 16:16.551
Red flag is very dangerous,
we cannot fly.

16:17.590 --> 16:20.684
We just killed ourselves.
-Let's go back.

16:21.274 --> 16:23.002
Oh my gosh!

16:25.819 --> 16:29.771
It was my decision to take the
Fast Forward, I wanted that Express Pass.

16:29.872 --> 16:31.510
I wanted...

16:33.520 --> 16:37.491
It's all right. -I wanted
to make a smart decision.

16:38.676 --> 16:43.157
But that could be...
We could ruin our race.

16:43.558 --> 16:46.922
It's all right. We still
have so much to do.

16:50.431 --> 16:55.150
Come on. Keep your head up.
It's not over.

16:59.257 --> 17:03.975
Just when you want something
so bad, we waited so long!

17:05.787 --> 17:09.732
We have the possibility
of being first team eliminated.

17:10.876 --> 17:15.208
It really, just... Rips your
heart right out of your chest.

17:17.992 --> 17:21.990
This is so amazing, oh my God.
Best helicopter ride ever.

17:22.290 --> 17:26.321
Oh, there's a Christ?
-Yeah, yeah. Cristo el Redentor.

17:26.530 --> 17:30.961
There it is. He's overlooking
the entire city. - Oh my goodness.

17:31.725 --> 17:33.725
These mountains
are just specatacular.

17:33.725 --> 17:39.501
(?), did you ever think, when you were
a little kid, back in (?) in Alabama.

17:39.936 --> 17:42.651
There it is, that could be
Christ the Redeemer.

17:43.725 --> 17:45.725
Wow, look at this.
-This is incredible.

17:46.025 --> 17:47.725
We saw Christ the Redeemer.

17:47.925 --> 17:51.086
It's hard to put in the words how amazing
that is, how much it means to us,

17:51.187 --> 17:55.170
seeing that really reminds us
that we're awes to even be in Rio,

17:55.271 --> 17:58.231
Be able to travel the world. -The most
beautiful thing I've ever seen in my life.

18:00.951 --> 18:04.847
We just spent all of our money. So we're
definitely not getting the Exprass Pass.

18:04.948 --> 18:07.016
Now I'm just faith to stay alive.

18:07.051 --> 18:12.273
Looks like we're coming in for our landing.
Hope he asks us a question we know answer to.

18:16.725 --> 18:21.207
Good morning. What's the name of the
monument you passed during the flight?

18:21.585 --> 18:26.967
Cristo el Redentor. -That's correct.
-Yes! -Your prize. -Thank you!

18:27.723 --> 18:29.597
Detour: Sand or Sidewalk.

18:29.725 --> 18:34.493
Soccer is Brazil's number one
sport, and it's so popular here

18:34.593 --> 18:37.526
they play it on volleyball courts.

18:37.726 --> 18:41.901
<i>Sand requires teams to play
footvolley, against the local pros,</i>

18:42.139 --> 18:46.144
<i>who have agreed to give them a fighting
chance, by allowing them to use their hands.</i>

18:46.203 --> 18:50.725
<i>If teams can score 6 points,
before the pros score 18,</i>

18:50.825 --> 18:52.413
<i>they will receive their next clue.</i>

18:53.135 --> 18:59.308
<i>This Portuguese stone mosaic stretches for
more than 3km along the Copacabana beach.</i>

18:59.682 --> 19:04.397
<i>Sidewalk requires teams to put a
giant geometric slide puzzle together.</i>

19:05.492 --> 19:10.945
If they can piece together the pattern of the
pavement, they'll receive their next clue.

19:11.169 --> 19:14.383
Which one, honey? -Sidewalk.
-Sidewalk. Okay, let's go.

19:14.604 --> 19:17.863
The mother and son. -You're good.
-Yes, please(?), thanks so much.

19:18.344 --> 19:21.364
Sidewalk? -Sidewalk?
-We're doing sidewalk.

19:21.921 --> 19:25.944
I've never been in helicopter before.
-I hanen't either, I'm excited!

19:26.152 --> 19:30.316
Oh my God, this is not happening
right now. -This is so... Bye!

19:31.355 --> 19:35.620
(?) look, try to look at some flihts, and
mark (?) some flights or something.

19:35.828 --> 19:39.825
Right now we're trying to write down all these
places where the helicopter is going to go.

19:39.926 --> 19:42.148
Because we don't know what kind
of question they're gonna ask us,

19:42.430 --> 19:45.982
so, we're just trying to
anticipate it basically.

19:46.083 --> 19:48.223
Can't wait to see that,
we might see that.

19:49.261 --> 19:52.323
I see the statue of
Christ the Redeemer. -Wow!

19:52.816 --> 19:58.135
This is awesome. That is so cool.
-Oh my gosh! Wow!

19:58.735 --> 20:01.677
I can almost give him a high five, yo.

20:01.816 --> 20:07.049
Oh yeah. This is the way to
see Rio. Wow, amazing.

20:07.258 --> 20:09.673
I can give you a flight kiss.

20:20.649 --> 20:23.440
Everybody wears short shorts here.
-Oh my goodness.

20:23.541 --> 20:25.655
(Now we're gonna use
these bags for) change, honey.

20:25.690 --> 20:28.352
I don't mind it, you know, I like
short shorts. -He like short shorts.

20:28.453 --> 20:31.004
I have to... -She hates me in short
clothes. -I don't like him in short shorts.

20:31.254 --> 20:35.709
Those shorts are just way too short and shows
too much leg. -But that's the style here.

20:35.717 --> 20:38.460
There it is. -(?). -Yeah.
Come on honey, let's go.

20:38.461 --> 20:41.808
So let's take a deep breath real
quick, and take a look at the floor.

20:41.809 --> 20:43.694
(?) make the floor.

20:44.876 --> 20:48.899
(?), back at school, at medical school
training we did not have to work any puzzles.

20:49.107 --> 20:52.998
Right there, mom. -I see it, baby.
Oh my gosh, there's another team here.

20:53.206 --> 20:56.032
That's okay, that's okay,
I'm not worried about that.

20:56.240 --> 21:00.078
Looks like this one is not good, this
one is not good. -This one goes right here.

21:00.509 --> 21:03.228
Okay, let's do one at
a time. I got it, I got it.

21:03.329 --> 21:06.165
I got it, you gotta give me
a second to work it out, okay?

21:06.307 --> 21:09.699
This is your first time in helicopter.
-Yeah, but not for you. -Not.

21:10.470 --> 21:15.117
We have to do aerial shots often
of celebrity homes.

21:15.755 --> 21:18.806
Sensational.
A camera would be nice right now.

21:19.014 --> 21:23.323
I kind of like not having my camera,
and just really feeling everything.

21:24.817 --> 21:28.026
Oh, my gosh. We're moving.
-Whoo! -Oh, my gosh!

21:28.647 --> 21:34.307
I don't like this. Oh my... Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my... Oh... We're over water.

21:35.136 --> 21:40.416
It's really high up, when he's keep droping
the helicopter and he's turning like this.

21:42.252 --> 21:45.503
Let's not do that.

21:48.628 --> 21:50.780
Welcome.

21:51.014 --> 21:54.509
We only had to get 6 points,
by the time they had 18, and...

21:55.039 --> 21:58.724
we were competing with our hands, but they had
to hit it or with their feet or their heads.

21:58.825 --> 22:00.748
So we felt confident going in.

22:09.017 --> 22:12.641
Wow. -That was incredible.

22:22.367 --> 22:24.615
He's killing us.

22:26.062 --> 22:29.088
We use our hands, they don't
use their hands. -Oh, we got this.

22:29.592 --> 22:31.610
You got it, you got it, you got it.

22:34.826 --> 22:38.250
Oh no! The beach volleyball
people were amazing.

22:40.189 --> 22:41.956
No way!

22:47.641 --> 22:50.757
Yay! -This is so crazy.

22:53.085 --> 22:55.363
These pieces go back here.

22:56.116 --> 22:59.788
When I was little, I done a lot of puzzles.
-That's what we did, we did puzzles at night.

22:59.889 --> 23:01.388
That was our (?) at night.

23:01.965 --> 23:05.389
Most kids (?) not the puzzles.
-So that one is here. It's here.

23:07.279 --> 23:09.602
This is not here? -No!

23:11.920 --> 23:15.717
That's not how you switch, we have to move
to switch. -We got to move this one, too.

23:16.418 --> 23:18.432
Okay, don't (?).
-Let me do it, let me do it.

23:18.640 --> 23:23.564
In our relationship, comunication, the way
he says things to me, it affects me.

23:24.065 --> 23:26.307
That's not how you switch.

23:26.515 --> 23:28.315
He's used to that back in the O. R,

23:28.316 --> 23:31.333
when he's talking to his nurses,
and when he uses a certain tone.

23:31.504 --> 23:33.597
Let me do it, let me do it.

23:38.719 --> 23:42.581
Let's go! Playing that beach volleyball
really brought out or competative side

23:42.682 --> 23:44.548
because, we're athletes.

23:49.503 --> 23:53.108
We got experience in playing volleyball
together, so we kind of know each other.

23:53.109 --> 23:55.554
We were just in game time mode.

23:59.873 --> 24:01.968
One more, it's over.

24:02.915 --> 24:05.067
One more, come on.

24:09.109 --> 24:13.277
Go! Woo! Go, let's go!

24:17.793 --> 24:19.690
Thank you so much. -(?).

24:19.725 --> 24:23.942
Make your way to Arpador
lookout, your next Pitstop.

24:24.150 --> 24:27.510
Teams must now <i>make their
way to Arpador lookout,</i>

24:27.718 --> 24:31.090
<i>which offers  spectacular views
of Rio's famous beaches.</i>

24:31.298 --> 24:36.183
The last team to check in there
at the mat, may be eliminated.

24:36.806 --> 24:39.854
Let ask anyone how to get there.
-You know Arpador? Where it is?

24:40.155 --> 24:42.925
We can walk? -Walk. -Thank you.

24:43.133 --> 24:45.210
Let's go! Let's go.

24:46.070 --> 24:48.390
You got it, you got it, you got it.

24:50.476 --> 24:53.043
No way!
Yes!

24:56.723 --> 24:59.867
If they get a cab, they'll beat us.
-Huh? -They get a cab, they'll beat us.

24:59.868 --> 25:01.503
(?) walking, (anybody?).

25:01.828 --> 25:04.087
Headed to the Pitstop!

25:05.582 --> 25:08.445
This one goes here.
-All right, you're (?) too much.

25:08.546 --> 25:10.786
This one goes down here.
-One at a time, honey.

25:10.821 --> 25:14.204
We got to move it like a snake,
so you don't lose track.

25:14.412 --> 25:21.088
This (?) to switch. This pieces go
back here. That's right. This is right.

25:21.389 --> 25:24.247
These two are not. -Okay.

25:25.201 --> 25:27.255
This one should be down here,
and this one should be up here.

25:27.356 --> 25:29.566
Honey, (?) one by one.
Keep it up (?).

25:32.480 --> 25:34.806
We got it!

25:38.525 --> 25:40.882
We gotta switch. -No, no, no.

25:41.370 --> 25:42.869
We will get it,
we will get it.

25:42.904 --> 25:46.395
Do you know where this is? -2km.
-2km, we can run that.

25:46.603 --> 25:49.010
Oh, my God!
Are you kidding me?

25:49.218 --> 25:54.793
We're here, just want to see these numbers
on these boards. And there's no numbers.

25:55.001 --> 25:57.552
We're screwed.

25:58.428 --> 26:02.720
My God, this is amazing. I can't
even... look how beautiful this is.

26:02.938 --> 26:04.306
Wow.

26:09.249 --> 26:14.322
We're officially in last place. And we're broke.
-Something is better than nothing, i guess.

26:15.180 --> 26:19.164
I can't fathom...
being the first team eliminated.

26:19.465 --> 26:23.422
Chris the Redeemer.
(?) would be (?) things here.

26:26.823 --> 26:29.610
How long would you say that
Texas ended before us?

26:29.611 --> 26:33.208
They changed super fast, and
they're also, they finished fast too.

26:33.367 --> 26:36.713
It's around that white thing. -I just don't
know how far along... -I don't know either.

26:37.097 --> 26:40.311
We're screwed, (?) take
a cab, we messed up. -Let's run.

26:40.894 --> 26:44.461
We should have got cab.
-Let's make sure we get to, we (?).

26:44.669 --> 26:47.183
Man, we should have taken a cab!
-It's killing us.

26:47.391 --> 26:51.324
(?) close, it might be the lookout area.
-This is lookout area? -Yeah.

26:51.532 --> 26:55.114
Pit Stop's here. Should be
up here. -This is all about.

27:01.450 --> 27:03.540
Let's go!

27:06.210 --> 27:09.425
Welcome to Rio!
-Beautiful.

27:09.633 --> 27:12.486
What's beautiful?
-Uh... -You are!

27:13.217 --> 27:15.362
Everything!
-Ev... Everything!

27:15.570 --> 27:20.046
Josh and Tanner, I'm pleased to tell you.
You're team number one!

27:20.910 --> 27:24.895
And i have some great news for you.
You guys have won the Express Pass.

27:25.103 --> 27:28.223
You can use this
Express Pass, to skip any task

27:28.431 --> 27:31.097
that you don't wanna do,
before the end of the 5th leg.

27:31.305 --> 27:36.287
Once you use the Express Pass, you then
have to hand it over to another team. -Okay.

27:36.646 --> 27:40.039
And that team will have to use
it on the next leg. -It feels so good.

27:40.074 --> 27:44.371
As the first competition we are in,
our confidence is pushed up, so,

27:44.579 --> 27:47.203
to be here feels amazing.
It's unbelievable.

27:47.411 --> 27:51.393
Lesson learnt from the 1st leg which
really help, quickly things can change.

27:51.601 --> 27:56.126
From the boat to sitting here in the 1st
place. -No looking back. -Watch what we do.

27:56.922 --> 28:00.249
Phil!
-Get on that mat.

28:00.735 --> 28:03.566
Jazmine and Danielle,
you're the team number two!

28:04.884 --> 28:06.987
Yes.

28:12.307 --> 28:15.118
It hurts!
-Damn it!

28:15.164 --> 28:17.376
We were radicilous.

28:20.746 --> 28:22.779
Get it!

28:23.006 --> 28:27.891
We're not good at volleyball. -Oh, I'm
terrible in volleyball! Holly Molly.

28:29.184 --> 28:31.998
Maybe this isn't our thing.
A couple more tries and we're done.

28:33.204 --> 28:37.539
Definitely. -We can't play volleyball. This
will take all day, we got to do the other one.

28:39.357 --> 28:41.662
I think I'll take a breath.
-Yeah, yeah, for sure.

28:41.763 --> 28:44.663
We're not (?) get it, all right?
We're gonna get it.

28:44.675 --> 28:47.981
Let's get throught this puzzle,
let's keep it cool and get it done. -Yeah.

28:50.770 --> 28:54.123
There.
Check? Judge?

28:57.639 --> 28:59.885
We got it!
-Thank you.

29:05.175 --> 29:08.128
That's not right.
-It's harder than it looks.

29:08.336 --> 29:12.861
Taxi! -I don't... let's go play volleyball.
-You want to try the game, volleyball?

29:13.462 --> 29:16.828
You don't want to?
-We can do that?

29:17.331 --> 29:22.869
Good morning. -Morning. -What's the full name
of the monument you passed in the flight?

29:25.272 --> 29:30.578
Hey, roll it down. -The monument?
-The monument, right there. (?) down.

29:31.040 --> 29:35.207
Uh... Christ the Redeemer?
-That's correct.

29:36.805 --> 29:38.902
Thank you, thank you.

29:39.531 --> 29:43.446
Rick, I love how you just addopted, and you
just become... -Yeah, you know... -Local.

29:43.547 --> 29:47.042
In a hurry. -I'm a little too white for the
area, but... -You're working on your tan!

29:47.077 --> 29:48.551
I'm working on my tan!

29:50.225 --> 29:55.370
You made it. Did you put lipstick on before
you came to the mat? -Yes I did! -Look at that!

29:55.578 --> 29:58.146
Pink it! Nothing pink, pink!

30:01.574 --> 30:05.457
We realized just cupple minutes ago
that we're actually redoing the floor,

30:05.458 --> 30:07.609
you know, Copacabana beach,
which is pretty cool, we're

30:07.651 --> 30:10.465
trying to figure out the wawe paterrn.

30:10.673 --> 30:13.539
So we just made the same move we did before.
-Okay, but I think we should go around.

30:13.840 --> 30:17.765
You wanna go... We just did that, and it took
us to the wrong spot, every ... time!

30:18.462 --> 30:23.569
Wait. Step back for a second and think
about how you're going to move the pieces up.

30:24.583 --> 30:28.793
It's very frustrating.
-Oh, dude! These are tiny.

30:29.023 --> 30:32.842
What was this? -Check out shorts we're about
to wear. -So we're wearing nothing but that?

30:33.050 --> 30:36.739
I didn't want to wear those shorts. He likes
being naked, I don't like being naked.

30:36.947 --> 30:40.424
It's not that like being... It's Brazil,
who doesn't like being naked. But anyway,

30:40.632 --> 30:43.955
they brought out me, like, ladies was
looking like: "who's that play volleyball"?

30:44.971 --> 30:47.087
No way, are we
using our hands? -Yeah.

30:47.704 --> 30:51.686
Got it? We're
just getting warmed up.

30:51.894 --> 30:56.498
Two people played against, but not even like,
normal people. -They're just absolutely amazing.

30:56.785 --> 30:58.372
Oh. -Damn.

30:58.883 --> 31:01.573
You gotta be kidding.

31:07.530 --> 31:09.171
Damn it!

31:10.547 --> 31:13.163
There you go. Go!

31:16.312 --> 31:19.983
What a...? You hit with the
bottom of your foot!

31:20.343 --> 31:22.762
Come on, we got this. -Hey, hey!

31:32.835 --> 31:38.148
Oh, my God! This sucks.
-Strong finish, come on, baby.

31:47.314 --> 31:49.478
Thank you.
USA!

31:49.698 --> 31:53.413
We're in cab, on our way to
Copacabana beach. Fast, fast, fast.

31:53.781 --> 31:58.148
This is all I got. Any chance to get help
doing favor? -Where you go? -Copacabana Beach,

31:58.356 --> 32:04.256
The Four. -Costa Four. -Costa Four?
-Costa Four. Please. -Okay.

32:04.464 --> 32:10.217
We have a chance. -Why are we stopping?
-Beach. Copacabana Beach. -It's over there?

32:10.225 --> 32:14.788
All right. We just ? to get out. -But this beach
could be too long ass, we can't just get out.

32:14.889 --> 32:19.307
We have to keep driving. We need to find
red-yellow flag. What? -He wants us out.

32:19.342 --> 32:21.340
He wants us out? -Yeah.

32:21.548 --> 32:25.954
I guess we're sorry. We just have no idea
how far this is. -Come on, we're already ?.

32:26.162 --> 32:29.628
Oh, my God, Tiff.
Where the hell is this place?

32:31.626 --> 32:36.207
I just want to see some other
teams. That's all I need to see.

32:36.415 --> 32:41.090
Do you know where Costa Four is?
How far? -Too far. -Too far?

32:42.940 --> 32:46.703
He wanted us out of the cab, I knew it.
Why did he tell us to get out?

32:47.035 --> 32:50.054
Shoot!
-Damn it, what do we do?

32:54.026 --> 32:58.385
Why did he tell us to get out?
-Krista, he wanted us out because. Just go.

32:58.593 --> 33:03.626
But cab driver did not like us...
-We're not giving up, let's go.

33:03.727 --> 33:06.909
We're not giving up,
we're not giving up...

33:07.522 --> 33:11.532
Look how beautifull, honey.
-Logan and Chris, you're team number five.

33:14.930 --> 33:20.274
One team, just one team. I want to relieve some
of that pressure if I see somebody else there.

33:20.888 --> 33:24.623
They're still doing the puzzle.
-Oh, they still doing the puzzle.

33:24.831 --> 33:27.440
Let's do this baby, come on!
-Oh, my God!

33:27.799 --> 33:31.620
Dream Team is behind us, they were
on the flight ahead of us by half hour.

33:31.828 --> 33:36.501
I thought they're so far on front... -Please
help me. -Kelly, I am! You need to relax.

33:36.709 --> 33:39.277
Hey, other teams,
how you guys doing?

33:40.308 --> 33:45.028
You guys are short!
-Come on, this way! There you go.

33:49.196 --> 33:51.541
Two points away!
-Damn.

33:52.214 --> 33:55.262
How many points you guys got
over there? -Shut up!

33:56.045 --> 33:59.023
I see it! They're still doing it.
We're in it. Come on.

33:59.124 --> 34:01.706
I know! -The green
team's still there. let's go!

34:02.783 --> 34:06.726
Cheerleaders! There's people
behind us. We're so in this race!

34:06.934 --> 34:12.121
We're going to volleyball. I think we'll have
better chance to that than to figure this out.

34:12.422 --> 34:16.330
They're going volleyball. Let's do this, baby,
come on! Put that beautiful brain to work.

34:17.416 --> 34:20.559
One point! One point,
mate, we can do this!

34:22.967 --> 34:25.005
Just one, just one!

34:27.380 --> 34:29.842
This is tough.
-Let's go, we got this!

34:30.051 --> 34:34.085
We can do this. They maybe able to spike the ball
but we can get it over the net too. Let's do it.

34:41.732 --> 34:44.411
Oh, my God!
You gotta be kidding.

34:44.620 --> 34:49.819
Let's do this! Let's go! -We though we had the
physical down, and then we seen the little people.

34:51.701 --> 34:55.509
And they ended up beating us.
Don't underestimate the little people.

34:55.717 --> 34:57.974
Dude, I'm so proud of us.
-Two little guys.

35:02.854 --> 35:04.511
Oh, my God!

35:09.238 --> 35:11.290
This is hard!
-You wanted to do.

35:11.498 --> 35:16.255
This isn't working. We're athletic, but playing
against them, we're both five foot nothing,

35:16.256 --> 35:18.376
this must be impossible.

35:20.166 --> 35:23.689
It's just a little frustrating
when you can't get something.

35:24.659 --> 35:28.107
Should we switch? Just go.
-Yeah. -Okay. -We can't do this.

35:28.108 --> 35:30.208
We think this one
is going to be a lot easier.

35:30.320 --> 35:33.252
First leg!
First Pitstop, baby!

35:33.460 --> 35:37.149
There's a million dollars waiting
for one team. -Could be us!

35:41.843 --> 35:44.232
Game point!

35:52.023 --> 35:55.802
Ken and barby just gone.
They just finished. -Taxi!

35:56.355 --> 36:00.891
I suck in this. -Me too! -Come on,
let's switch. We're switching detours.

36:01.099 --> 36:03.694
We're going to kick some
butt on the volleyball court.

36:03.902 --> 36:06.218
Okay, bro,
let's get out of here.

36:15.670 --> 36:17.764
Ernest!

36:25.839 --> 36:29.201
Actually the most frustrating
part is the last two pieces.

36:29.202 --> 36:31.411
You have to switch
everything around to the end.

36:31.663 --> 36:35.403
So frustrating. -We're just
literally going to circles now.

36:35.611 --> 36:39.350
We had it great, and than we fucked it
all up. So now we're just going to circles.

36:41.572 --> 36:44.002
Oh, my God, Shev, I am dying!

36:44.403 --> 36:49.468
Once you put one in the right spot,
the other one won't to go back.

36:49.676 --> 36:51.604
My biggest fear is loosing,
I'm not a loser.

36:51.605 --> 36:55.155
I don't thin I have ever lost in anything
I have ever done in my life.

36:55.181 --> 36:57.792
Oh, my God!

36:58.116 --> 37:01.690
And that's what I'm talking about.
-Check out this beach guys, look at it.

37:01.898 --> 37:06.400
It's beautiful. -Beautiful.
Beautiful... everything.

37:06.608 --> 37:10.330
Yeah, beautiful everything.
This is (?).

37:12.212 --> 37:14.613
We have to get six.
We're gonna win this.

37:28.025 --> 37:30.262
Perfect, perfect!

37:37.359 --> 37:40.894
We've been doing this for hours.
It's really hard.

37:41.102 --> 37:44.370
Wow, this is actually impossible.
-Why are you giving up on yourself?

37:44.371 --> 37:50.338
I'm not giving up. -This is it. Look at me.
We can do this. -No, stop, stop.

37:50.546 --> 37:53.817
No, you're like frustrating me because
you're saying like it's impossible.

37:53.818 --> 37:56.379
It's not impossible, we can get that.

37:59.231 --> 38:03.632
This goes... Listen , listen! -I'm listening!
This one goes where? -This one goes down here.

38:03.669 --> 38:06.284
Shevonne, I don't
know what to do.

38:08.067 --> 38:10.783
I mean. We can stand
there and look at it, but...

38:12.588 --> 38:14.477
Damn it!

38:21.972 --> 38:25.229
Shevonne, I need help,
I'm switching, I need help.

38:25.530 --> 38:28.676
I think if we got cut first it would
be hard to go back to work,

38:28.884 --> 38:32.502
because we're working with a lot of guys
that are kind of underestimate us anyway.

38:32.710 --> 38:36.864
So, it would be open season.
-Be not stupid! So embarrasing.

38:37.072 --> 38:39.826
We're so close to the end!
It's so frustrating.

38:40.034 --> 38:43.817
I know when things get really
frusdtrated, you just wanna quit, but,

38:44.418 --> 38:46.922
we didn't come all this way for this.

38:46.957 --> 38:51.019
We're turning (?). -To be on 1st place
and know youre 1st place and you have a lead,

38:51.227 --> 38:54.680
to make a stupid mistake an
be an hour behind everybody else.

38:54.888 --> 38:59.435
I can not believe we're still in this race. We'll
never, ever make another stupid mistake like that.

38:59.643 --> 39:03.509
No. We're going to play a lot smarter. -My heart
is pumping out of my chests, it's so grateful.

39:03.717 --> 39:07.083
(?) cry until we get to
the Pitstop. -No more crying!

39:08.202 --> 39:12.647
We both just wanted this so bad.
I want to make all dreams come true

39:12.648 --> 39:14.267
and this would be a nightmare.

39:14.470 --> 39:19.745
Go here, two days later you go home.
-Pretty humbling? -Very humbling.

39:20.363 --> 39:23.566
I'm still confident, but
I'm definitely not cocky.

39:28.010 --> 39:31.331
So now we need to get this to here.

39:39.182 --> 39:42.464
Every time we move something
it just messes something else up.

39:42.672 --> 39:45.421
So this piece needs to go
here and then we're done.

39:45.422 --> 39:48.099
What if we just move
this whole thing around?

39:49.470 --> 39:51.706
Try it.

39:52.484 --> 39:55.230
This one needs to go here, and not (?).

39:56.615 --> 39:59.302
We're so screwed.

40:01.829 --> 40:06.752
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!
Did we finish it? Did we finish it?

40:14.420 --> 40:17.849
You know what's so sad? So, I really
thought we were smarter than cheerleaders,

40:17.950 --> 40:20.165
and you know what,
we're definitely not.

40:21.025 --> 40:25.061
Let's go. -Just get in.
-We have to get there as fast as we can.

40:25.347 --> 40:31.147
Okay? -I'm so proud of you!
-You're crying! -We did it!

40:31.355 --> 40:35.660
We beat up TMZ girls, so please,
you have to drive fast, okay?

40:37.216 --> 40:39.701
I see you're smart.

40:41.739 --> 40:45.535
(???) Rio de Janeiro,
and all I got was (???).

40:45.743 --> 40:48.124
We're never going to
hear the end of this, Tiff.

40:48.525 --> 40:51.918
We're going to be
annihilated in our newsroom.

40:52.126 --> 40:56.530
It is absoultely 100%, and you know what,
I would annihilate me if I were them, so,

40:56.531 --> 40:58.206
I totally get it.

41:01.123 --> 41:04.472
Oh, my God! You're still in the race,
you're team number ten!

41:10.487 --> 41:13.617
I think we're gonna do the same
thing as we done a hundred times.

41:15.954 --> 41:18.899
We finished it.
-We got it!

41:22.044 --> 41:26.002
We did it.
Don't cry!

41:29.130 --> 41:32.140
Oh, he come to see us.

41:33.209 --> 41:38.864
Well, congratulations. -We finished it. -You
finished it! Before the sun went down, too.

41:39.389 --> 41:42.316
It took too long.
This is awful.

41:42.671 --> 41:46.407
Unfortunately, all the other teams
have checked in. I'm sorry to tell you,

41:46.615 --> 41:48.714
that you have been
eliminated from the race.

41:48.922 --> 41:51.767
I just want to know what gonna
happen when you go back to work.

41:51.975 --> 41:54.512
Oh, it's never ending.
-We didn't make it to the first leg,

41:54.720 --> 41:59.964
bring it on, I'm the biggest loser
that ever played this game.

42:00.172 --> 42:03.076
Do you think this is a (???) show?
-Maybe we should be a nicer.

42:03.077 --> 42:04.952
Pa-lease (?).

42:08.008 --> 42:10.767
I'm going to hit the bar.
-You're going to hit the bar. Okay.

42:25.591 --> 42:28.782
<i>Stay tuned for a look at this
season of The Amazing Race.</i>

42:28.990 --> 42:31.226
<i>This season on

42:50.920 --> 42:52.937

42:53.145 --> 42:56.958
Stop yelling. -I'm not yelling,
I'm telling you. -This could be (???).
