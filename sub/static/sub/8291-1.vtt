01:14.424 --> 01:16.358
Two times nine is 18.

01:16.526 --> 01:18.551
Three times nine is 27.

01:18.762 --> 01:21.492
Four times nine is 36.

01:44.287 --> 01:46.414
Come in, please.

01:49.392 --> 01:51.326
Here we are, Mary.

02:05.108 --> 02:09.169
I have a most painful matter
to discuss with you, Mary.

02:12.649 --> 02:15.618
Your sister.
Have you heard from her lately?

02:15.785 --> 02:18.686
No, Mrs. Lowood.
She doesn't write often.

02:18.855 --> 02:23.451
- Have you any other relatives, Mary?
- No. Jacqueline brought me up.

02:23.660 --> 02:26.128
Somehow I never felt
I needed other relatives.

02:26.296 --> 02:28.127
That makes it all the more difficult.

02:28.298 --> 02:30.858
Difficult? Has anything happened
to Jacqueline?

02:31.034 --> 02:32.331
We don't know, Mary.

02:32.502 --> 02:34.868
We've been unable
to get in touch with your sister.

02:35.605 --> 02:37.539
Sometimes she can be quite careless.

02:37.707 --> 02:41.165
- Why don't you try Mrs. Redi?
- I've written repeatedly to Mrs. Redi.

02:41.344 --> 02:44.404
She vouchsafes
no information whatsoever.

02:45.548 --> 02:49.143
It is six months, Mary,
since your tuition has been paid.

02:49.919 --> 02:54.253
Naturally, it's impossible for you
to stay on here as a paying pupil.

02:54.457 --> 02:56.584
- Of course.
- Miss Gilcrist and I...

02:56.759 --> 02:58.590
...have talked the matter over.

02:58.761 --> 03:01.127
You can stay on here and work...

03:01.364 --> 03:04.856
...with the younger children
as sort of an assistant teacher.

03:05.034 --> 03:07.229
But, Mrs. Lowood,
I can't just stay on here...

03:07.403 --> 03:10.099
...without knowing what's happened
to my sister.

03:10.273 --> 03:13.208
Maybe if I went to New York,
if I saw Mrs. Redi myself...

03:13.376 --> 03:15.844
I doubt if you'll get anything
out of that woman.

03:16.045 --> 03:18.570
But if you'd like to try...

03:18.748 --> 03:21.376
...I'll advance the money
to make the trip to New York.

03:21.551 --> 03:25.544
Of course, my dear,
if you don't find your sister...

03:25.722 --> 03:27.986
...you can always come back here.

03:28.157 --> 03:29.522
Thank you.

03:36.399 --> 03:38.026
Mary.

03:38.801 --> 03:40.632
Don't come back.

03:40.970 --> 03:43.200
No matter if you never find your sister.

03:43.373 --> 03:45.170
No matter what happens to you.

03:45.375 --> 03:47.400
Don't come back.

03:48.511 --> 03:50.843
My parents died when I was a pupil.

03:51.080 --> 03:52.945
I left as you are leaving.

03:53.182 --> 03:54.979
But I didn't have courage.

03:55.218 --> 03:58.312
One must have courage
to really live in the world.

03:58.922 --> 04:00.412
I came back.

04:00.590 --> 04:02.148
Gilcrist.

04:17.807 --> 04:22.744
Agnes, John Quincy Adams
did not follow John Adams as president.

04:26.149 --> 04:29.380
<i>Build thee more stately mansions,</i>
<i>O my soul</i>

04:29.619 --> 04:33.851
<i>As the swift seasons roll!</i>
<i>Leave thy low-vaulted past!</i>

04:34.023 --> 04:36.457
<i>Let each new temple,</i>
<i>Nobler than the last</i>

04:36.626 --> 04:39.595
<i>Shut thee from heaven</i>
<i>With a dome more vast</i>

04:39.762 --> 04:42.196
<i>Till thou at length art free</i>

04:45.335 --> 04:46.996
That's enough.

04:51.274 --> 04:53.367
It seems all right, Joseph.

04:53.543 --> 04:56.478
You see, we do keep up the quality
of La Sagesse products...

04:56.646 --> 04:58.944
...in spite of Jacqueline's absence.

05:00.049 --> 05:03.746
But you must know someone
who has seen or heard of my sister.

05:03.953 --> 05:06.114
I'm afraid not.

05:08.925 --> 05:12.361
Your sister had many friends,
but they were not my friends.

05:13.162 --> 05:15.824
I was only the manager of her plant.

05:19.702 --> 05:21.465
Mrs. Redi, there's one thing.

05:21.637 --> 05:24.265
With Jacqueline gone,
how do you carry on the business?

05:24.440 --> 05:27.238
What do you do with the receipts?
How do you sign the checks?

05:27.410 --> 05:29.640
Why, Mary, I'm amazed.

05:29.812 --> 05:31.677
Didn't Jacqueline tell you?

05:31.914 --> 05:35.145
She sold the business to me
at least eight months ago.

05:35.351 --> 05:38.650
- It's my business now.
- I didn't know that.

05:38.888 --> 05:41.448
Yes, and I must say
I've done quite well with it.

05:41.624 --> 05:44.252
Perhaps even better than Jacqueline.

05:45.161 --> 05:47.561
There's nothing you can think of?
Old letters?

05:47.730 --> 05:51.359
Anything that might give me some hint
as to where I might find Jacqueline?

05:51.601 --> 05:54.195
Leave your address.
If I find anything, I'll be in touch.

05:54.370 --> 05:57.498
- I'm stopping at the Chatsworth.
- Thank you, my dear.

06:00.309 --> 06:02.641
Why, Mary.

06:03.212 --> 06:05.612
- Hello, Frances.
- How are you, honey?

06:05.782 --> 06:07.875
- How's Miss Jacqueline?
- I don't know.

06:08.051 --> 06:11.179
That's why I came to see Mrs. Redi.
I'm trying to find her.

06:11.421 --> 06:14.549
You mean she's gone
and you don't know where she is?

06:14.991 --> 06:16.618
Come here a minute.

06:23.466 --> 06:25.366
I don't get this.

06:25.535 --> 06:28.060
Miss Jacqueline's so crazy
about you.

06:28.304 --> 06:31.637
She always talked about you,
and she had your picture in her office.

06:31.808 --> 06:33.298
I know.

06:33.476 --> 06:36.138
For the first time
I'm beginning to feel frightened.

06:36.312 --> 06:38.803
I almost feel as if
I'd never known my sister.

06:38.981 --> 06:40.608
Nothing's happened to her.

06:40.783 --> 06:43.775
It's just I can't understand
her not keeping in touch with you.

06:43.953 --> 06:46.717
- I can't understand it at all.
- Well, don't worry about it.

06:46.889 --> 06:49.357
I saw Miss Jacqueline myself
about a week ago.

06:49.525 --> 06:51.720
At a restaurant
the boyfriend took me to.

06:51.894 --> 06:55.455
A little Italian place down in the Village
called the Dante.

06:55.631 --> 06:57.929
- The Dante?
- Yes, it's on Perry Street.

06:58.134 --> 07:01.865
Why don't you ask the people who own
the place? They'll remember Jacqueline.

07:02.071 --> 07:04.403
Anybody who ever sees her
never forgets her.

07:04.607 --> 07:06.472
I'll try there.

08:05.301 --> 08:07.201
I'm sorry to bother you.

08:07.370 --> 08:09.895
- I want to ask you about my sister.
- Yes?

08:10.072 --> 08:13.041
I thought you might know her.
She was seen here about a week ago.

08:13.209 --> 08:15.404
Her name is Jacqueline Gibson.

08:15.578 --> 08:17.102
I don't know no Gibson.

08:17.280 --> 08:19.077
This is a restaurant.

08:19.248 --> 08:22.945
- Many people come here.
- She's very beautiful.

08:23.386 --> 08:25.377
I wish I could tell you
what she looks like.

08:25.555 --> 08:27.147
I'm sure you'd remember her.

08:27.323 --> 08:30.258
She's tall, with dark hair.

08:31.360 --> 08:33.692
Once you'd seen my sister,
you'd never forget her.

08:37.832 --> 08:41.030
- Maybe.
- Let me look at you.

08:41.504 --> 08:43.995
- You could be her sister.
- Yes.

08:44.173 --> 08:47.540
Yes, if she made that much impression
on you, I'm sure it was Jacqueline.

08:47.710 --> 08:49.678
She hasn't been here for a long time.

08:49.845 --> 08:51.836
- But she was here?
- Oh, yes, yes.

08:52.014 --> 08:53.914
One day a beautiful car comes here.

08:54.083 --> 08:56.813
This beautiful woman in furs gets out.

08:56.986 --> 08:59.887
There is a handsome man with her,
and the chauffeur.

09:00.489 --> 09:02.548
The lady rents
one of our upstairs rooms...

09:02.725 --> 09:05.193
...and the chauffeur changes
the lock on the doors.

09:05.361 --> 09:07.329
Then the lady does not come back.

09:07.530 --> 09:09.157
Not to live anyhow.

09:09.332 --> 09:11.960
She came back three or four times.

09:12.134 --> 09:14.568
But always alone. Just to eat.

09:15.504 --> 09:18.166
You mean she just came here,
rented the room...

09:18.341 --> 09:21.902
...locked it and left?
- Yes, and pays the rent every month.

09:22.278 --> 09:24.178
Could you let me see that room?

09:24.447 --> 09:25.812
If it is hers...

09:25.982 --> 09:29.213
...there might be something there
to help me find my sister.

09:29.385 --> 09:31.512
No, the rent is paid.

09:31.787 --> 09:34.221
The lady asked us to promise.

09:34.690 --> 09:37.921
- I won't open the door.
- Please.

09:39.095 --> 09:40.995
It's important.

10:03.352 --> 10:04.580
What did he say?

10:04.754 --> 10:08.190
He said he always wanted to see
the inside of this room anyway.

10:20.936 --> 10:23.166
I tell you, when a thing
like this comes up...

10:23.339 --> 10:24.966
...you've got to go to the police.

10:25.141 --> 10:27.006
What do you think
people pay taxes for?

10:27.176 --> 10:30.771
It ain't just to keep us chasing
after crooks and regulating traffic.

10:30.980 --> 10:33.039
We're supposed to help everybody.

10:33.215 --> 10:36.673
Now, you've got to go to the police
about your sister, miss.

10:36.852 --> 10:39.650
I've had some experience
with the Bureau of Missing Persons...

10:39.822 --> 10:41.414
Yeah. Well, Mr. Hoag...

10:41.590 --> 10:44.559
...lost persons are the concern
of the Missing Persons Bureau.

10:45.227 --> 10:48.492
You stick to your poetry.
You're the poet, Jason.

10:48.664 --> 10:51.531
Well, in a way that makes everything
my business, doesn't it?

10:51.701 --> 10:54.966
- Were you going to make a suggestion?
- Yes.

10:55.204 --> 10:58.799
I was going to ask you
to look into your own heart.

10:58.974 --> 11:01.238
Do you really want to find your sister?

11:01.410 --> 11:02.877
Oh, my Jason.

11:03.045 --> 11:06.310
Always laughing,
always joking to help others.

11:06.549 --> 11:09.712
He's a good boy, miss.
He just talks that way.

11:09.885 --> 11:12.683
I'm a good boy, but no one
listens to what I say.

11:12.855 --> 11:14.288
Now, you do what I tell you...

11:14.457 --> 11:17.654
...and go to the Missing Persons Bureau
for your sister.

11:17.827 --> 11:21.024
- lf you'll give me the address.
- Certainly.

11:24.467 --> 11:27.868
- She was only 16.
- Had she ever run away before?

11:28.037 --> 11:32.030
- What did he have on when last seen?
- He went out without his hat or his coat.

11:32.208 --> 11:34.199
It's very cold for such an old man.

11:34.377 --> 11:36.311
Any identifying marks or characteristics?

11:36.479 --> 11:39.346
Scars, amputation, tattoo marks,
speech impediments?

11:39.515 --> 11:41.107
No, none.

11:41.751 --> 11:42.979
Sign here.

11:43.152 --> 11:44.483
Any further details?

11:44.653 --> 11:48.145
She sold her business about
eight months ago to Mrs. Esther Redi.

11:48.324 --> 11:50.485
What relation are you
to the missing person?

11:50.659 --> 11:52.149
Sister.

11:53.095 --> 11:54.756
Sign here.

12:01.337 --> 12:03.805
Excuse me. I'm Irving August.

12:03.973 --> 12:06.635
Private investigator.
I think I can help you.

12:06.809 --> 12:08.572
Here's my card.

12:09.678 --> 12:11.612
The name may not mean
anything to you...

12:11.781 --> 12:14.215
...but say the word and
I'll have her in 48 hours.

12:14.617 --> 12:16.642
- Can you?
- Look, sister.

12:16.819 --> 12:19.947
Manhattan is only nine miles long
and four and a half miles wide.

12:20.122 --> 12:22.215
I ain't never been off it.
I know it like...

12:22.425 --> 12:24.017
Like you know your own back yard.

12:24.193 --> 12:27.253
Now you just get me a small retainer,
say, 50 bucks...

12:27.430 --> 12:31.196
...and I get your sister. I guarantee it.
- I haven't any money right now...

12:31.367 --> 12:34.894
...but I'll get a job and...
- Lady, this kind of work costs money.

12:35.070 --> 12:37.095
I gotta cover all the hospitals,
the morgue.

12:37.273 --> 12:41.004
That's the first place you gotta go
and it ain't pleasant, the morgue.

12:45.414 --> 12:49.180
- You know who I am, August?
- Sure, I do.

12:49.351 --> 12:53.515
Then you know if I give you a little advice,
it'll be good advice.

12:53.689 --> 12:55.714
- Yeah, sure.
- That girl was looking...

12:55.891 --> 12:58.018
...for Jacqueline Gibson.

12:58.194 --> 13:00.321
If I were you, I'd forget it.

13:00.529 --> 13:03.498
Okay, Mr. Radeau. It's forgot.

13:09.171 --> 13:12.368
Hey, Danny, get me the file
on Jacqueline Gibson, will you?

13:33.195 --> 13:36.130
- Whom do you wish to see?
- Mr. Gregory Ward, please.

13:36.298 --> 13:39.631
- And what is it about, Miss Gibson?
- A personal matter.

13:39.802 --> 13:42.965
- I was given Mr. Ward's name.
- May I ask who gave you his name?

13:44.406 --> 13:46.101
The morgue.

13:47.810 --> 13:49.437
Do you feel all right?

13:50.579 --> 13:54.310
I feel like an idiot,
fainting in a stranger's office.

13:55.451 --> 13:57.851
We're not exactly strangers, Mary.

13:58.020 --> 13:59.578
Jacqueline spoke about you often.

14:00.122 --> 14:01.783
I suppose she told you about me.

14:01.957 --> 14:04.755
No. At the morgue, they told me
a Mr. Gregory Ward...

14:04.927 --> 14:08.590
...had made inquiries about Jacqueline.
- At the morgue? No wonder you fainted.

14:08.764 --> 14:12.256
- I wish you'd come to me first.
- Then you know who Jacqueline is?

14:12.434 --> 14:14.402
But I'd give a great deal to know.

14:14.637 --> 14:16.036
Why?

14:16.805 --> 14:18.500
I love your sister, Mary.

14:18.774 --> 14:20.799
I love her very much.

14:21.277 --> 14:23.802
It's easy to understand now, isn't it?

14:24.313 --> 14:26.679
A man would look
for her anywhere, Mary.

14:26.849 --> 14:30.478
There's something exciting
and unforgettable about Jacqueline.

14:30.653 --> 14:33.850
Something you never quite get hold of.

14:34.223 --> 14:38.216
Something that keeps
a man following after her.

14:38.594 --> 14:41.893
Because I loved Jacqueline,
I thought I knew her.

14:42.631 --> 14:45.566
Today I found out such strange things.

14:45.734 --> 14:47.634
Frightening things.

14:47.970 --> 14:52.600
I saw a hangman's noose
that Jacqueline had hanging, waiting.

14:53.008 --> 14:55.101
Well, at least I can explain that.

14:55.644 --> 14:58.135
Your sister had a feeling about life...

14:58.414 --> 15:01.076
...that it wasn't worth living
unless one could end it.

15:01.283 --> 15:03.683
- I helped her get that room.
- Weren't you afraid?

15:03.886 --> 15:05.945
Afraid she might commit suicide?

15:06.589 --> 15:09.183
People who commit suicide
don't talk about it.

15:09.658 --> 15:12.627
No, that room made her happy...

15:12.995 --> 15:16.431
...in some strange way
I couldn't understand.

15:17.166 --> 15:19.828
She lived in a world of her own fancy.

15:20.402 --> 15:22.461
She didn't always tell the truth.

15:23.238 --> 15:26.366
In fact, I'm afraid she didn't know
what the truth was.

15:27.142 --> 15:30.475
- It's difficult to explain to a youngster.
- I'm not a youngster.

15:30.646 --> 15:34.377
- I can understand.
- Color's returning to your cheeks.

15:34.550 --> 15:37.018
You look as if you were
coming back to life.

15:37.419 --> 15:39.580
Sure you didn't faint
because you were hungry?

15:40.055 --> 15:44.151
- You know, I didn't have lunch.
- Well, it's nearly 6. Time for dinner.

15:48.297 --> 15:51.061
- Thank you. It was a lovely dinner.
- Good.

15:51.300 --> 15:55.794
But I feel guilty. It doesn't seem right for
me to enjoy myself with Jacqueline gone.

15:55.971 --> 15:58.906
Look, you can't make looking
for Jacqueline your life's work.

15:59.074 --> 16:03.010
You've got to do other things.
Live, get some enjoyment out of life.

16:03.178 --> 16:05.544
- I hope you'll let me help you.
- Thank you.

16:05.714 --> 16:08.080
- Good night.
- Good night, Mary.

16:17.660 --> 16:20.322
Miss Gibson, I've been waiting for you.

16:20.496 --> 16:22.930
I want you to know
I decided to take your case.

16:23.098 --> 16:25.965
- Mr. August, I'm not at all...
- Look, don't say a word.

16:26.135 --> 16:28.968
I've taken an interest in you
and I'm willing to help you.

16:29.138 --> 16:31.072
I think I know where to find your sister.

16:31.240 --> 16:33.902
- Where?
- Wait a minute. This has a lot of angles.

16:34.076 --> 16:35.737
You've gotta take it easy.

16:35.911 --> 16:37.970
Tell me, do you know a Mrs. Redi?

16:38.147 --> 16:41.548
- Yes, she bought my sister's business.
- That's what she told you.

16:41.717 --> 16:45.278
I looked it up in the Hall of Records.
Your sister deeded her the business...

16:45.454 --> 16:48.184
...as an outright gift.
- Why would Mrs. Redi lie to me?

16:48.857 --> 16:52.657
That's what I tried to find out.
I went to the La Sagesse...

16:52.895 --> 16:55.125
...used a phony health inspector's badge.

16:55.297 --> 16:58.323
They let me go through the works.
All but one room.

16:58.534 --> 17:00.297
That room was locked.

17:01.503 --> 17:05.940
- I'd like to see the inside of that room.
- You think my sister is there?

17:06.407 --> 17:09.343
- Can't tell.
- Can we go there now?

17:09.511 --> 17:11.536
You can't just go breaking into places.

17:11.714 --> 17:14.012
They got a night watchman
and locks on the door.

17:14.183 --> 17:17.242
If she's in there, it won't make
any difference about warrants.

17:17.419 --> 17:20.217
- I want to go there.
- I don't know if...

17:20.388 --> 17:22.823
...if I wanna go with you or not.

18:07.536 --> 18:09.231
Which room is it?

18:09.938 --> 18:11.929
It's the last door at the end of this hall.

18:21.917 --> 18:23.509
You scared?

18:23.685 --> 18:25.152
Yes.

18:25.988 --> 18:28.980
- Let's get out of here.
- No.

18:31.493 --> 18:33.757
You could go on, Mr. August.

18:33.996 --> 18:36.624
You could open the door.
I'd stay right here.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.662
It's only a little way, Mr. August.

18:43.472 --> 18:45.497
We can't stand here all night.

18:46.041 --> 18:48.168
You could go and open the door.

19:35.591 --> 19:38.389
Mr. August, the night watchman.

19:40.562 --> 19:43.326
The night watchman, he's in the salon.

19:44.900 --> 19:47.198
Mr. August, what is it?

19:47.402 --> 19:49.199
What's the matter?

19:51.673 --> 19:53.163
Mr. August.

20:34.650 --> 20:36.811
Do you know where you're going, lady?

20:36.985 --> 20:39.249
You've been to the end of the line
and back again.

20:39.421 --> 20:41.548
I hope you enjoyed the ride.

22:01.336 --> 22:03.964
Please. Please.

22:09.111 --> 22:11.443
I want your help, please.

22:12.647 --> 22:14.512
Those men, don't let them get out.

22:14.683 --> 22:17.846
- What's the matter now?
- One of them has been murdered.

22:21.990 --> 22:23.685
What men?

22:27.763 --> 22:29.458
But they were there.

22:29.765 --> 22:31.255
Oh, yeah?

22:31.433 --> 22:34.459
Extra! Murder, read all about it!

22:34.636 --> 22:37.935
Extra! Murder, read all about it!

22:38.106 --> 22:41.633
Extra! Murder, read all about it!

22:41.810 --> 22:45.507
Extra! Murder, read all about it!

22:49.518 --> 22:50.917
Thank you.

23:03.432 --> 23:06.128
It's about another murder.
A woman on 52nd Street.

23:06.301 --> 23:08.269
But you do believe me.

23:09.104 --> 23:12.665
Well, the important thing is
the police won't believe you.

23:12.841 --> 23:15.207
I saw him on the floor.

23:15.610 --> 23:18.579
He was cut here.

23:18.947 --> 23:21.040
The blood was running out.

23:21.349 --> 23:23.283
He was dead, I know it.

23:23.718 --> 23:26.312
And then on the subway I saw him.

23:26.488 --> 23:29.821
White. With the men
holding him up between them.

23:29.991 --> 23:34.052
Yes, of course. But the police would say
you'd probably had a bad dream.

23:34.229 --> 23:37.062
He was a kind little man in his way.

23:37.365 --> 23:40.562
And I made him go down
that hall into the darkness.

23:40.836 --> 23:42.929
I made him do it.

23:43.171 --> 23:44.968
Drink your milk.

23:45.574 --> 23:48.202
I don't like to be ordered to do anything.

23:48.477 --> 23:51.810
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't intend
to treat you like a child.

23:51.980 --> 23:55.245
- But you have treated me that way.
- I won't do it again.

23:55.450 --> 23:59.443
We're friends. I promise
I'll never order you about again.

24:02.858 --> 24:05.622
However, I won't say
that I'll not take charge occasionally.

24:05.794 --> 24:07.659
And I'm going to take charge right now.

24:07.829 --> 24:10.195
- I have a job for you.
- A job?

24:10.365 --> 24:12.595
Remember you told me
you're good with youngsters?

24:12.767 --> 24:15.668
Well, today I bumped into
an old friend of mine, Mrs. Wheeler.

24:15.837 --> 24:18.135
She runs a settlement house
down in the Village.

24:18.306 --> 24:21.673
- She's looking for a kindergarten teacher.
- I'd like that.

24:21.843 --> 24:24.607
It's not much money,
but it'd be enough to live on.

24:24.779 --> 24:27.043
You'd move out of that hotel
to a furnished room.

24:27.382 --> 24:30.215
Maybe the Romaris would have a room.
They seem nice.

24:30.385 --> 24:33.149
- The people at the restaurant?
- Yes.

24:33.922 --> 24:37.187
If you want, I have time to take you
to see Mrs. Wheeler right now.

24:39.521 --> 24:42.456
Yes, sir. Mr. Ward will see you
in just a few minutes.

24:42.624 --> 24:45.252
- Won't you wait, Dr. Judd?
- Thank you.

24:46.294 --> 24:49.627
- Dr. Judd? Are you Dr. Louis Judd?
- Yes.

24:49.798 --> 24:52.858
I read your book in which you wrote
about the cure for drinking.

24:53.068 --> 24:56.970
- You're not a dipsomaniac at your age?
- No, it's...

24:57.539 --> 24:59.234
It's my father.

24:59.474 --> 25:02.841
I wanted to talk to you.
You wrote about cures.

25:03.078 --> 25:05.012
I'm sorry, I don't practice anymore.

25:05.180 --> 25:07.648
I find it easier to write
about mental illness...

25:07.816 --> 25:09.807
...and leave the cure of it to others.

25:12.287 --> 25:13.618
Yes, sir.

25:14.089 --> 25:16.614
Mr. Ward is free now, doctor.

25:16.791 --> 25:19.624
There are other psychiatrists
who can help your father.

25:19.894 --> 25:22.727
Dipsomania is rather sordid.

25:23.264 --> 25:24.856
Thank you.

25:31.406 --> 25:34.671
I've come from Jacqueline.
She needs money.

25:35.276 --> 25:37.403
I thought you didn't know
where she was.

25:37.579 --> 25:40.070
I didn't. She came to me
a few days ago.

25:40.348 --> 25:41.940
To put it delicately...

25:42.117 --> 25:44.847
...her care imposes
a financial burden upon me.

25:45.019 --> 25:47.010
She thought you might
lighten that burden.

25:47.222 --> 25:49.952
If she wants money from me,
she can come to me herself.

25:50.125 --> 25:51.922
I'm afraid she can't do that, Ward.

25:52.093 --> 25:54.527
- It would endanger her.
- This is nonsense.

25:54.696 --> 25:57.631
Unless I know where Jacqueline is
and how she is...

25:57.799 --> 25:59.733
...I'm not going to give you any money.

25:59.934 --> 26:01.868
You're a curious man.

26:02.270 --> 26:06.070
You're willing to jeopardize her life
in order to satisfy your own curiosity.

26:06.474 --> 26:08.567
It's not just for myself I'm asking.

26:08.743 --> 26:11.211
Her sister's here.
The kid's half crazy with anxiety.

26:11.846 --> 26:14.212
As a man you distrust me.

26:15.216 --> 26:17.616
Perhaps you can believe me
as a physician.

26:17.952 --> 26:20.682
Well, then I can tell you
in addition to other dangers...

26:20.889 --> 26:23.414
...there's a danger of Jacqueline
losing her sanity.

26:23.725 --> 26:26.751
- I would advise against you seeing her.
- But why?

26:26.995 --> 26:30.260
She's been ill, erratic,
but I've never known of anything like that.

26:30.432 --> 26:33.162
You can believe me or not
just as you choose.

26:36.237 --> 26:39.172
- How much does she want?
- She can use a hundred dollars.

26:39.808 --> 26:42.743
- I'll give you a check.
- She can only use cash.

26:46.881 --> 26:50.214
- I haven't got that much in cash.
- How much have you?

26:50.785 --> 26:52.150
About 45 dollars.

26:52.454 --> 26:55.116
For the time being,
I imagine that must do.

26:56.758 --> 26:58.020
Thank you.

26:58.593 --> 27:01.027
- Tell me, how is Jacqueline?
- As beautiful as ever.

27:01.196 --> 27:03.664
- Tell me...
- She's nervous under the circumstances.

27:03.832 --> 27:05.026
What circumstances?

27:07.001 --> 27:09.401
Mama, see, Miss Gibson helped me.

27:09.571 --> 27:13.200
- It's a table.
- Beautiful. We show it to Papa tonight.

27:13.374 --> 27:16.810
- Did Michelle eat her soup today?
- She's been an angel.

27:17.312 --> 27:20.873
- Mommy, wait for me.
- Angelo, wait.

27:24.018 --> 27:27.181
Well, Mary, aren't you the popular one.
You've a visitor again.

27:27.355 --> 27:29.721
- Mr. Ward?
- No, not this time.

27:29.891 --> 27:32.860
It's a gentleman called Judd.
Dr. Judd.

27:34.796 --> 27:37.196
- Dr. Judd?
- Yes, Miss Gibson.

27:37.465 --> 27:39.956
I've come to take you to your sister.

27:40.134 --> 27:42.694
Don't be so amazed,
it's a very ordinary matter.

27:42.871 --> 27:44.600
I'm Jacqueline's physician.

27:44.772 --> 27:47.240
Mr. Ward told me you were here.
Jacqueline sent me...

27:47.408 --> 27:50.104
...to bring you to her.
- Then you know where she is?

27:50.311 --> 27:52.973
If I didn't know where she was,
could I take you to her?

27:53.181 --> 27:55.547
Get your hat and coat.
We haven't much time.

28:01.256 --> 28:05.090
It's amid marble splendors such as these
that Jacqueline dwells.

28:05.393 --> 28:07.020
One can take either staircase.

28:07.228 --> 28:10.391
I prefer the left, the sinister side.

28:28.583 --> 28:30.244
She's not here. She's gone.

28:42.864 --> 28:46.561
I don't know why she left.
She knows she shouldn't have.

28:57.745 --> 28:59.440
She's left me to meet them alone.

29:00.048 --> 29:01.709
I can't.

29:01.883 --> 29:04.147
What makes you so nervous, Dr. Judd?

29:04.385 --> 29:05.716
Who are they?

29:05.887 --> 29:08.515
I can't stay here. I'll have to leave you.

29:31.346 --> 29:32.904
Jacqueline.

30:45.820 --> 30:47.287
Is this her?

30:47.822 --> 30:49.449
No.

30:52.093 --> 30:54.061
- Where's Jacqueline Gibson?
- I don't know.

30:54.228 --> 30:57.163
- She was just here. Where did she go?
- I tell you, I don't know.

30:57.331 --> 30:59.925
You went out with her
and don't know where she went?

31:00.101 --> 31:01.966
I don't know.

31:02.904 --> 31:06.704
Why do you want Jacqueline?
What right have you to question me?

31:06.874 --> 31:10.571
I have all the right in the world.
I'm Paul Radeau, a private investigator.

31:10.745 --> 31:13.270
I've been hired to find your sister
by her husband...

31:13.514 --> 31:16.506
...Gregory Ward.
- Husband?

31:35.103 --> 31:37.469
What are you thinking of, Bella?
Can I eat dry?

31:37.638 --> 31:40.766
Oh, the wine. I have forgotten the wine.

31:43.444 --> 31:47.278
Look, Mary, just because I kept a secret
from you doesn't make a monster of me.

31:47.482 --> 31:50.940
Please, I can't go on explaining things
like this to your right ear.

31:51.152 --> 31:53.620
Last night in this very restaurant,
Mr. Jason Hoag...

31:53.788 --> 31:55.779
...paid a pretty compliment
to my right ear.

31:55.957 --> 31:57.822
- Who the devil is he?
- A poet.

31:57.992 --> 31:59.550
He's sitting right over there.

31:59.727 --> 32:02.594
That's his table,
the one at the feet of Dante.

32:02.764 --> 32:06.495
Do you remember the first day you came
to my office, frightened and broken up?

32:06.667 --> 32:10.364
And I asked you if Jacqueline had ever
spoken about me to you? You said no.

32:10.571 --> 32:12.835
Then how could I tell you
we were married?

32:13.007 --> 32:14.474
And afterwards...

32:14.642 --> 32:18.100
I didn't tell you afterwards because
there were so many things coming up...

32:18.279 --> 32:20.679
...to make me worry.

32:20.848 --> 32:23.248
My beautiful one.
Why do you bring me wine...

32:23.417 --> 32:25.908
...when you yourself are so intoxicating?

32:26.387 --> 32:28.855
You're my favorite audience, Bella.

32:32.827 --> 32:35.318
Why can't everyone
be happy like we are?

32:35.496 --> 32:37.521
Laugh and have a good time?

32:37.765 --> 32:41.633
That poor little one, so sad
because she can't find her sister.

32:41.803 --> 32:44.203
And that man with her,
he doesn't make her laugh.

32:44.372 --> 32:45.930
Just sits and talks.

32:46.107 --> 32:48.735
We are happy, Mrs. Romari,
because you have everything...

32:48.910 --> 32:50.844
...and I have nothing to lose.

32:51.012 --> 32:52.912
You should make her laugh, Jason.

32:53.147 --> 32:55.012
Come, make jokes for her.

32:55.183 --> 32:57.583
You could have told me
you were Jacqueline's husband.

32:57.752 --> 33:02.246
Things changed, Mary.
The reasons for finding Jacqueline changed.

33:02.757 --> 33:04.918
I want to find her to settle things.

33:05.226 --> 33:07.490
What things? Why?

33:08.329 --> 33:11.389
Why you two are so sad?
Your food will not digest...

33:11.566 --> 33:13.227
...and your wine will sour.

33:13.401 --> 33:17.167
You must laugh to eat well.
I've brought Jason to make you laugh.

33:17.405 --> 33:20.738
Mr. Hoag, this is Mr. Ward.

33:23.544 --> 33:26.843
Sit down. I'll get the rest of your dinner.

33:31.419 --> 33:33.979
I'm under orders to make you laugh.

33:34.155 --> 33:38.023
In Mrs. Romari's mind, poetry and humor
have some strange affinity...

33:38.192 --> 33:39.887
...which they don't have in fact.

33:40.094 --> 33:42.892
She wants me to play the fool for you...

33:43.064 --> 33:45.658
...but suddenly, Miss Gibson,
I feel as sad as you do.

33:45.833 --> 33:47.733
Well, then I've spoiled your dinner.

33:47.902 --> 33:50.427
Your food won't digest
and your wine will sour.

33:50.605 --> 33:54.803
You will have to make all the jokes,
because I'm going to be serious.

33:55.710 --> 33:57.200
I'm going to find your sister.

33:58.980 --> 34:00.914
Shuffle the cards well, Natalie.

34:01.082 --> 34:03.573
This is a trick of telepathy,
not card manipulation.

34:06.120 --> 34:08.145
Now pass the cards to me.

34:08.422 --> 34:11.858
Gladys, will you hand the cards to Louis
while I answer the door?

34:20.534 --> 34:23.799
- Jason. How nice to see you.
- I have brought some friends, Natalie.

34:23.971 --> 34:26.531
- May we come to your party?
- Oh, of course, come in.

34:26.706 --> 34:30.734
Now, all of you must remember the cards
that you've selected.

34:31.379 --> 34:34.940
- Mrs. Cortez, Mary Gibson and Mr. Ward.
- So nice to meet you.

34:35.116 --> 34:36.879
The cards can't speak for themselves.

34:37.051 --> 34:40.020
- It's purely a matter of the mind.
- You'll have to excuse me.

34:40.521 --> 34:44.286
Mrs. Freeman, yours was the jack
of spades. Gladys, seven of diamonds.

34:44.492 --> 34:48.485
- Yours, Mrs. Gosden, the queen of hearts.
- How do you ever do it, Louis?

34:49.030 --> 34:50.496
Hello, Jason.

34:52.500 --> 34:54.434
Where is Jacqueline Gibson?

34:55.069 --> 34:57.799
- What a peculiar question.
- I saw you with her last week.

34:57.972 --> 35:00.099
I knew you'd be here tonight.
Where is she?

35:00.341 --> 35:02.832
It's neither your business
to ask nor mine to tell.

35:03.010 --> 35:05.740
Wait. Look over there.

35:06.414 --> 35:07.847
Do you see that girl?

35:08.349 --> 35:11.785
That's Jacqueline's sister.
It's because of her that I ask.

35:12.019 --> 35:13.714
Why come to me?

35:13.988 --> 35:17.287
Because there was another girl years ago.
A nice girl.

35:17.591 --> 35:19.491
She lived in Barrow Street.

35:19.727 --> 35:21.524
I saw her with you once.

35:21.696 --> 35:23.596
I saw her with you twice.

35:24.231 --> 35:27.564
- Then I never saw her again.
- She was my patient.

35:28.402 --> 35:29.699
What was she to you?

35:30.705 --> 35:32.866
I don't think you'd understand
if I told you.

35:33.074 --> 35:35.736
I think I understand
without your telling me.

35:35.910 --> 35:38.208
I know something of your history, Jason.

35:38.379 --> 35:40.939
I know you haven't written for 10 years.

35:41.482 --> 35:42.813
I've lost the knack.

35:43.017 --> 35:44.951
After that wonderful first book?

35:45.219 --> 35:48.620
After all the adulation and good reviews?

35:49.523 --> 35:52.492
I'd have given anything
to have written that book.

35:54.095 --> 35:57.030
You had all my admiration and respect...

35:57.498 --> 35:58.931
...once.

36:00.935 --> 36:02.197
There you are.

36:02.370 --> 36:04.497
Do you know any more card tricks?

36:07.308 --> 36:09.071
Hello, Ward.

36:09.443 --> 36:10.671
My dear Miss Gibson.

36:10.845 --> 36:13.609
Gibson? Are you Jacqueline's sister?

36:13.848 --> 36:15.577
- Yes, do you..?
- Know her?

36:15.750 --> 36:19.208
My dear, we were intimate.
The times we used to have together.

36:19.387 --> 36:21.981
I bet she never told you about that.
You're too young.

36:22.156 --> 36:23.748
I'm afraid you don't understand.

36:23.924 --> 36:25.892
Miss Gibson's sister is missing.

36:26.060 --> 36:28.085
Missing? Well, no wonder.

36:28.262 --> 36:32.028
When she took up with Louis Judd,
she went out of circulation just like that.

36:35.102 --> 36:37.764
My dear, have I said something?

36:45.012 --> 36:46.946
Too many people here.

36:48.649 --> 36:51.277
Perhaps Jacqueline is lonely for me.

36:52.353 --> 36:55.447
You see, Mary, I'm not quite a fool.

36:56.023 --> 36:58.287
At least you knew about Dr. Judd.

36:58.459 --> 37:01.360
- Yes.
- And you knew he'd be here.

37:01.529 --> 37:03.087
Yes.

37:03.264 --> 37:07.132
And now that I've shown you that
I know that much, and can guess more...

37:07.301 --> 37:09.735
...will you trust me
to look for Jacqueline?

37:10.137 --> 37:12.901
I want you to look for Jacqueline.

37:15.509 --> 37:17.909
I'm a terrible failure, Mary.

37:18.245 --> 37:21.578
A book clerk by day and a poet by night.

37:21.782 --> 37:23.909
Not a very good one.

37:24.418 --> 37:27.683
But if you'll trust me,
at this one thing I won't fail.

37:28.055 --> 37:29.488
I'll find your sister.

37:29.723 --> 37:33.682
You have such lovely hands,
Miss Gottschalk. So slim and capable.

37:33.961 --> 37:37.419
Mr. Hoag, I really shouldn't be doing this.
It's against the rules.

37:37.598 --> 37:39.065
Why did you say you wanted them?

37:39.233 --> 37:43.135
I'd like to see what books my friends read
so I'll know what to buy them.

37:43.304 --> 37:45.238
Nothing nicer than a book for a gift.

37:46.874 --> 37:48.933
Who was the first one? Mrs. Redi?

37:49.143 --> 37:51.611
P, Q, R...

37:52.246 --> 37:54.009
Yes, here it is.

37:54.181 --> 37:57.582
- And the other was Judd?
- Yes, Dr. Louis Judd.

37:58.619 --> 38:00.211
He's here too.

38:00.588 --> 38:04.080
Would it be asking too much
for you to get me these books?

38:04.258 --> 38:06.658
No, not at all, Mr. Hoag.

38:07.294 --> 38:10.889
Why, Mr. Hoag, most of these books
are on the closed shelf.

38:11.065 --> 38:12.657
You'll have to get permission.

38:12.833 --> 38:15.859
I wouldn't want to take them out.
I'd like to look at them.

38:16.036 --> 38:18.504
Well, since you're over 21.

38:21.375 --> 38:23.002
Mimi.

38:26.380 --> 38:27.813
Come in.

38:29.583 --> 38:30.811
Well, what is it?

38:30.985 --> 38:34.216
A parallelogram with a split triangle
in its very center.

38:34.388 --> 38:38.017
I found out that Mrs. Redi
reads the same books as Dr. Judd.

38:38.192 --> 38:40.990
- I don't think that's so revealing.
- But who is Judd?

38:41.162 --> 38:44.529
A psychiatrist. It's quite natural
that he should read books...

38:44.698 --> 38:47.064
...on the history
of old religious societies.

38:47.234 --> 38:49.794
But why should Mrs. Redi,
a woman with a beauty parlor?

38:49.970 --> 38:51.835
- I don't know.
- That's just it.

38:52.006 --> 38:54.566
And this figure, she traced it.

38:54.742 --> 38:57.404
The book I saw at the library
had been marked "perfect"...

38:57.578 --> 38:59.443
...by the library inspector in March.

38:59.613 --> 39:02.810
Mrs. Redi had it out in April,
and no one else had read it since.

39:03.184 --> 39:05.982
This figure is the symbol
of the Palladists.

39:06.253 --> 39:09.051
It's all clear to me now. So clear.

39:09.223 --> 39:12.488
I thought so, but just to be sure
I'll tell you that the Palladists...

39:12.660 --> 39:15.720
...are a society of devil worshippers.
- Devil worshippers?

39:15.896 --> 39:17.761
But, look, I'm serious.

39:17.932 --> 39:20.662
It's a very real and earnest society.
A dangerous society.

39:20.834 --> 39:22.233
I can imagine.

39:22.403 --> 39:24.803
Sometime before
those nice white gloves are dry...

39:24.972 --> 39:28.408
...you're going to go and find out
a few things about this Mrs. Redi.

39:28.676 --> 39:31.167
Is Mrs. Redi nice to work for?

39:31.445 --> 39:33.242
Oh, Redi's all right.

39:33.414 --> 39:35.746
But there's only one Miss Jacqueline.

39:35.916 --> 39:37.884
Mrs. Redi seems rather
an odd woman to me.

39:38.052 --> 39:40.145
She's really a pretty good sort.

39:40.321 --> 39:43.017
What does she do with herself
after business hours?

39:44.091 --> 39:47.618
It's always seemed to me that
she was sort of lonely and unhappy.

39:47.795 --> 39:50.389
Well, Mary, I guess most people are.

39:50.931 --> 39:52.899
There, that's it.

39:58.305 --> 40:00.637
In the old days,
this would've been on the house.

40:02.276 --> 40:05.109
The tip is anyhow.
Besides, I like to do your hair.

40:05.279 --> 40:06.746
Thank you.

40:08.048 --> 40:10.141
Do you know what this is, Frances?

40:10.384 --> 40:12.477
Why, I ought to.

40:13.220 --> 40:14.983
Mrs. Redi's new trademark.

40:16.790 --> 40:20.385
Of course, I should've known.
This figure's been puzzling me.

40:28.869 --> 40:30.894
Hello, Mary. It's nice to see you.

40:31.071 --> 40:33.130
- No news of Jacqueline?
- I'm afraid not.

40:33.307 --> 40:35.138
Well, that's too bad.

40:41.548 --> 40:42.913
What did she want?

40:43.117 --> 40:44.948
Nothing. I just did her hair.

40:45.119 --> 40:46.484
What were you talking about?

40:46.787 --> 40:48.118
Nothing.

40:48.289 --> 40:51.053
Nothing? Why, that's absurd.

40:51.292 --> 40:54.090
I heard you laughing and talking.
She was asking questions.

40:54.261 --> 40:56.252
Oh, well, she was asking about you.

40:56.430 --> 40:58.830
Whether it was nice
to work for you or not.

40:58.999 --> 41:00.796
And that was all?

41:01.168 --> 41:03.762
Well, she asked about the trademark.

41:03.937 --> 41:06.337
- What did she want to know?
- She showed me a drawing.

41:06.507 --> 41:08.338
Oh, you fool.

41:08.509 --> 41:10.602
Why, that symbol is us.

41:10.778 --> 41:14.111
Us. She was asking about us.

41:37.137 --> 41:39.298
- Mary?
- Yes.

41:39.473 --> 41:41.600
This is Mrs. Redi, Mary.

41:41.809 --> 41:43.367
Oh, I'll be out in a minute.

41:43.544 --> 41:47.139
That won't be necessary.
I haven't much to say.

41:48.449 --> 41:51.543
If I were you, Mary,
I'd go back to school.

41:51.752 --> 41:54.812
I'd make no further attempt
to find Jacqueline.

41:55.155 --> 41:57.419
I can't give up looking for her,
Mrs. Redi.

41:57.591 --> 41:59.149
No matter what you're hinting at.

41:59.326 --> 42:02.227
I have no intention whatsoever
of hinting.

42:02.896 --> 42:05.922
Your sister, Mary, is a murderess.

42:06.367 --> 42:08.460
She killed Irving August.

42:08.836 --> 42:12.772
Stabbed him out of fright when he
discovered where she was hiding.

42:13.507 --> 42:14.940
I don't believe you.

42:15.109 --> 42:17.737
I had to help get rid of the body.

42:18.245 --> 42:20.406
You saw it on the subway.

42:21.014 --> 42:23.881
And I warn you, Mary, go back.

42:24.518 --> 42:26.110
You don't know what you're doing...

42:26.286 --> 42:29.847
...or what dreadful things you might
bring about by looking for your sister.

42:30.557 --> 42:32.684
You go back to school.

42:45.005 --> 42:46.529
I'm sorry to be late, Natalie.

42:46.707 --> 42:48.800
We haven't begun tea yet.

42:52.546 --> 42:54.878
- Hello, Frances.
- Hello, Mrs. Redi.

42:56.216 --> 42:58.343
- How do you do?
- Mrs. Redi.

43:00.454 --> 43:02.081
Won't you pour?

43:05.492 --> 43:07.084
I'm sorry, I'm nervous.

43:07.261 --> 43:09.593
- This is very trying for me.
- I know.

43:09.763 --> 43:11.355
You introduced Jacqueline to us.

43:11.532 --> 43:13.796
- But how could you tell?
- I should've known.

43:13.967 --> 43:16.527
She had no sincerity, no real belief.

43:16.703 --> 43:18.500
Miss Rowan, do you take cream?

43:19.106 --> 43:21.631
Please, Natalie,
would you mind pouring?

43:21.809 --> 43:23.436
You shouldn't be nervous.

43:23.644 --> 43:26.943
There's nothing personal or vengeful
in what we are about to do.

43:27.214 --> 43:28.841
We have only to make a decision.

43:29.149 --> 43:32.016
But it can be such a horrible decision...

43:32.519 --> 43:34.851
...because we're all pledged
to nonviolence.

43:35.155 --> 43:37.350
- Now, this...
- Our founder must have known...

43:37.524 --> 43:40.721
...when he wrote these
seemingly contradictory rules.

43:41.361 --> 43:43.488
The rule of nonviolence...

43:43.664 --> 43:46.963
...and the law that
whoever betrays us must die.

43:47.201 --> 43:49.931
- He must have known.
- But I don't understand it.

43:50.103 --> 43:53.231
Some of us, Frances,
must believe without understanding.

43:54.208 --> 43:55.641
Yes, I suppose so.

43:55.943 --> 43:58.207
I went back through the history
last night.

43:58.378 --> 44:00.869
I read about Johann Rozenquartz.

44:01.215 --> 44:04.616
- I read what he wrote about...
- I can quote it fully, Mrs. Redi.

44:04.818 --> 44:06.479
"We will avoid violence.

44:06.687 --> 44:09.713
For once undertaken,
violence can become its own master...

44:09.890 --> 44:12.723
...and lead to either good or evil."
- But he also wrote...

44:12.893 --> 44:14.485
I can quote that too.

44:16.029 --> 44:18.930
"Those who go out into the marketplaces
and speak of us...

44:19.099 --> 44:21.761
...and give knowledge
of our being and our deeds...

44:21.935 --> 44:23.698
...whomsoever doeth this shall die."

44:23.871 --> 44:25.236
I'm puzzled.

44:25.606 --> 44:27.597
Since our order was founded...

44:27.774 --> 44:29.708
...six betrayals have been listed.

44:29.877 --> 44:32.107
And six deaths as punishment.

44:32.613 --> 44:35.446
- And now there's Jacqueline.
- Oh, but...

44:35.616 --> 44:38.016
But you can't do anything to her.

44:38.318 --> 44:39.683
You mustn't hurt her.

44:39.853 --> 44:42.788
- But she betrayed us, Frances.
- She didn't betray us.

44:42.956 --> 44:45.925
She was only going to a doctor.
A psychiatrist.

44:46.093 --> 44:48.186
She told him, Frances.
She told him about us.

44:48.362 --> 44:49.886
I know this is difficult for you.

44:50.063 --> 44:52.463
- I know that you love her.
- But she didn't betray us.

44:52.633 --> 44:56.262
Even if I believed that, I would still
consider her a very dangerous woman.

44:56.436 --> 44:59.234
There is the matter
of Irving August's death.

44:59.640 --> 45:02.336
Without consulting me,
Mrs. Redi was ill-advised enough...

45:02.509 --> 45:04.807
...to have the body removed
by Leo and Durk.

45:05.913 --> 45:07.744
This makes us all a party to the crime.

45:09.116 --> 45:10.481
What if there's a trial?

45:11.218 --> 45:14.449
What if Jacqueline is asked
about the removal of the body?

45:15.389 --> 45:17.914
Do you think, Frances,
that she will keep silent?

45:18.325 --> 45:21.920
It is a real danger
and one which forces our decision.

45:22.396 --> 45:25.490
- And Jacqueline's sister?
- I've taken care of Mary.

45:25.699 --> 45:28.259
I've spoken to her,
and she's going back to school.

45:28.435 --> 45:31.461
Good. Then it is decided.

45:31.705 --> 45:34.401
Leo and Durk and I
will complete our plans.

45:48.889 --> 45:50.447
Mary.

45:55.696 --> 45:59.393
This is wonderful, your coming here
so unexpectedly.

45:59.566 --> 46:02.262
It's almost like a wish come true.

46:03.203 --> 46:05.228
I want to show you my room.

46:05.939 --> 46:07.668
I want you to see all of it.

46:08.075 --> 46:10.009
But it's a small room, Jason.

46:10.177 --> 46:12.008
It's grown big with the years.

46:12.846 --> 46:16.009
And my window,
through which I see the world.

46:16.483 --> 46:20.681
It's beautiful. That searchlight
and the stars.

46:20.854 --> 46:22.549
Oh, that's not a searchlight.

46:22.723 --> 46:26.090
It's a sword blade,
cutting the blue cloak of a prince.

46:26.326 --> 46:28.624
- Not stars...
- Jason.

46:28.795 --> 46:32.390
I'm going back to Highcliffe.
I've come to say goodbye.

46:33.133 --> 46:37.331
But I thought your coming up here
to the third floor to see me...

46:37.771 --> 46:40.638
Well, that it was your advent
into my world.

46:40.807 --> 46:42.775
It turns out to be goodbye. Why?

46:42.943 --> 46:44.843
Please don't make me tell you, Jason.

46:45.012 --> 46:47.242
I thought I was your friend, Mary.

46:47.414 --> 46:50.212
Just goodbye isn't enough for a friend.

46:53.186 --> 46:55.086
I had begun to write again.

46:55.622 --> 46:58.147
That's what I was doing
when you came in.

46:58.725 --> 47:00.818
It's because of Jacqueline.

47:01.361 --> 47:03.591
I can't go on looking for her.

47:04.164 --> 47:05.893
You went to see Mrs. Redi.

47:06.066 --> 47:08.227
She told you something. What was it?

47:08.869 --> 47:10.928
Jacqueline's a murderess.

47:11.371 --> 47:13.066
She killed a man.

47:13.473 --> 47:16.442
- You believe that?
- I have to.

47:16.610 --> 47:18.237
It was Irving August.

47:18.445 --> 47:22.381
Everything Mrs. Redi said,
it fits in with what I saw.

47:22.616 --> 47:25.915
She even knew that I'd seen
his body on the subway.

47:26.086 --> 47:27.644
But if it's true, then...

47:27.821 --> 47:30.483
...there's all the more reason
for you to find Jacqueline.

47:30.757 --> 47:33.885
And Gregory, he loves her.

47:34.828 --> 47:38.093
He loves you, Mary.
You'll have to tell him.

47:38.398 --> 47:41.196
He's Jacqueline's husband. I can't.

47:41.368 --> 47:43.199
But you've got to tell him, Mary.

47:43.370 --> 47:47.306
Even if only for the practical reason that
he's a lawyer and will know what to do.

47:47.474 --> 47:49.066
I'm going to phone him.

47:54.281 --> 47:56.545
Well, she's got to be found.

47:56.850 --> 47:58.374
That's the first step.

47:59.252 --> 48:02.153
She's got to be found so she can
give herself up to the police.

48:02.322 --> 48:04.586
But we've tried so long to find her.

48:04.758 --> 48:06.851
Judd could tell us, if he would.

48:07.094 --> 48:10.029
- Do you think he knows about this?
- I don't know.

48:10.630 --> 48:13.827
Well, he's clever,
and he's cautious in his way.

48:14.034 --> 48:16.559
I think if he knew
he'd advise her to do what I want.

48:16.737 --> 48:19.672
Surrender herself to the police
and stand trial.

48:20.507 --> 48:22.031
I don't think he knows.

48:22.209 --> 48:23.676
We could tell him.

48:25.545 --> 48:28.708
- Could you find him?
- I suppose so.

48:29.249 --> 48:31.149
I guess I could pick him up somewhere.

48:31.318 --> 48:32.717
Jason...

48:32.886 --> 48:34.877
...I sometimes wonder.

48:35.088 --> 48:36.680
You're so sweet to me.

48:36.857 --> 48:39.087
So kind and sympathetic.

48:39.693 --> 48:41.923
I don't know how I can ever thank you.

48:42.095 --> 48:43.426
Thank me?

48:44.164 --> 48:45.654
You don't have to thank me.

48:52.072 --> 48:54.768
- What's that?
- Verse.

48:54.941 --> 48:56.602
Verse I wrote.

50:09.749 --> 50:12.616
Don't bother going up.
I can do this all night, Jason.

50:12.786 --> 50:14.048
Watch.

50:23.730 --> 50:26.426
Following me to find Jacqueline?

50:26.766 --> 50:29.564
Well, it won't work.
Love and understanding...

50:29.736 --> 50:32.398
...won't make a good detective
out of a recalcitrant poet.

50:32.572 --> 50:34.836
Actually, there are two favors
I want to ask.

50:35.008 --> 50:37.977
One as a poet, one as a detective.

50:38.211 --> 50:40.907
Sounds strange.
I'm going to be very wary.

50:41.114 --> 50:43.947
Some time ago, you spoke
about my writing again.

50:44.184 --> 50:45.412
I want your help.

50:45.585 --> 50:48.247
I'd like you to bring this
to your publisher.

50:49.856 --> 50:51.881
This is curious, Jason.

50:52.158 --> 50:55.616
Half the time you talk as if Shakespeare
weren't fit to tie your shoelaces.

50:55.795 --> 50:57.660
Now this sudden humility.

50:57.831 --> 51:00.459
I should like people to read
what I have written.

51:00.634 --> 51:03.159
I hope it'll find as much favor
as your other book.

51:03.336 --> 51:06.464
But somehow I doubt it.
The time is out of tune.

51:06.640 --> 51:09.006
Why not let your publisher judge that?

51:09.676 --> 51:12.474
Wait. There's that other favor.

51:12.646 --> 51:14.876
- I'd forgotten.
- Tell me where Jacqueline is.

51:15.048 --> 51:18.506
- We've got to find her.
- You don't expect me to do that, do you?

51:18.685 --> 51:21.051
- Yes, when I tell you.
- Tell me what?

51:21.221 --> 51:23.781
You'll have good enough sense
to tell us where she is...

51:23.957 --> 51:27.393
...when I tell you she's a murderess.
She killed a man.

51:32.499 --> 51:35.593
Tell me, why this sudden desire
to publish?

51:35.769 --> 51:38.237
To awaken like Byron
and find yourself famous?

51:38.405 --> 51:40.896
- I think it's time.
- No other reason?

51:41.241 --> 51:44.335
No woman?
Not the little Miss Gibson?

51:44.511 --> 51:46.035
Perhaps.

51:52.652 --> 51:54.745
Wait a minute. I'll call her.

51:57.324 --> 51:59.656
Jacqueline, this is Judd.

52:04.164 --> 52:05.688
Jacqueline.

52:07.067 --> 52:09.092
- Who is it?
- Judd.

52:09.269 --> 52:12.363
I'm here with your sister.
Come on down.

52:28.922 --> 52:30.787
Oh, Mary.

52:31.658 --> 52:33.148
Jacqueline.

52:36.629 --> 52:38.187
It's all right.

52:38.498 --> 52:40.557
You're safe.
Nothing's going to hurt you.

52:40.734 --> 52:44.170
- Your husband seems very certain of that.
- Yes.

52:44.371 --> 52:47.135
I'm very certain there's only one way
to help you, Jacqueline...

52:47.340 --> 52:50.275
...to protect you.
You've got to come with us.

52:50.443 --> 52:53.935
Let me do all I can as a lawyer
to straighten out Irving August's death.

52:54.114 --> 52:55.638
You must come with us, darling.

52:55.815 --> 52:57.612
Let us help you.

53:15.001 --> 53:18.562
For me, this seems to be the end
of a delightful relationship.

53:21.708 --> 53:24.939
Here. This will put some life into you.

53:25.945 --> 53:28.106
It's like coming back to life.

53:29.082 --> 53:32.518
It would be much easier, Jacqueline,
if you told me exactly what happened.

53:32.685 --> 53:34.016
I'd know what to do for you.

53:34.521 --> 53:36.352
Please, Jacqueline.

53:40.026 --> 53:42.017
You know about the Palladists.

53:43.163 --> 53:45.028
You know who they are...

53:45.465 --> 53:46.989
...what they are.

53:48.568 --> 53:50.195
I was one of them.

53:50.403 --> 53:53.031
Jacqueline was always
a sensationalist...

53:53.206 --> 53:55.902
...trying to seize onto something.

53:56.776 --> 53:58.437
Anything to bring her happiness.

53:59.746 --> 54:03.204
Through Mrs. Redi, she stumbled
onto the Palladist movement.

54:03.616 --> 54:04.878
It appealed to her.

54:05.351 --> 54:07.615
I wasn't happy with them.

54:08.721 --> 54:10.848
I wanted to break away.

54:11.591 --> 54:13.684
I was miserable.

54:14.828 --> 54:17.058
I went to Louis for help.

54:18.164 --> 54:20.530
They felt that I'd betrayed them.

54:21.768 --> 54:23.861
They wanted me to die.

54:24.704 --> 54:26.638
Kill myself.

54:28.174 --> 54:30.972
They kept me locked up at La Sagesse.

54:31.878 --> 54:33.903
I was there such a long time.

54:34.447 --> 54:37.109
Imagine the effect of such
imprisonment on Jacqueline.

54:37.283 --> 54:39.046
I was terrified.

54:40.787 --> 54:43.654
The darkness
in the corners of the room...

54:44.324 --> 54:46.519
...all the little noises.

54:47.861 --> 54:50.591
Then one night the door opened.

54:51.297 --> 54:53.094
A man came in.

54:54.100 --> 54:56.125
Tiptoeing in.

54:56.936 --> 54:59.461
I had a scissors in my hand.

54:59.739 --> 55:00.967
I struck at him.

55:01.274 --> 55:04.437
Don't. We know what happened.
Don't go on.

55:04.611 --> 55:07.102
Any court in the land
would understand.

55:07.380 --> 55:11.749
We'll wait a few days, let you rest,
then we'll go to the police.

55:12.218 --> 55:15.312
Why can't Jacqueline stay here with me
for a few days?

55:15.488 --> 55:17.456
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

55:18.324 --> 55:19.985
There's my old friend.

55:21.361 --> 55:23.329
The searchlight?

55:23.530 --> 55:26.966
- Cyrano's sword.
- That's a funny thing to call it.

55:27.133 --> 55:28.532
I like it.

55:28.701 --> 55:30.828
I've always loved the story.

55:31.171 --> 55:34.004
A man knowing he couldn't have
the woman he loved...

55:34.541 --> 55:36.509
...and wooing her for his friend.

55:37.610 --> 55:39.771
We're friends, aren't we, Gregory?

55:40.346 --> 55:42.473
It's been a hard evening
for both of you.

55:42.815 --> 55:45.807
Perhaps you ought to take Jacqueline
to your room, Mary.

55:53.092 --> 55:54.787
Good night, Jacqueline.

55:57.130 --> 55:59.928
- Good night, Mary.
- Good night.

56:03.002 --> 56:05.402
This is no time to play Cyrano.

56:05.738 --> 56:07.035
What was in your mind?

56:07.207 --> 56:09.300
I wanted to get things clear
for Jacqueline.

56:09.475 --> 56:11.909
- To let her know.
- To let her know what?

56:12.111 --> 56:13.976
That you love Mary.

56:14.347 --> 56:16.178
She'll have to know sometime.

56:16.349 --> 56:17.873
Not from me.

56:18.484 --> 56:20.349
Not from Mary.

56:27.327 --> 56:29.591
Goodbye, darling.
I'll only be gone until 3.

56:29.762 --> 56:31.491
- Bye.
- lf you get lonely...

56:31.664 --> 56:35.566
...go down and see Mrs. Romari.
I told her you were staying with me.

56:38.571 --> 56:40.436
I won't be lonely.

57:18.978 --> 57:20.468
Yes, this is Mary.

57:22.849 --> 57:25.044
But she couldn't have gone out.

57:25.952 --> 57:27.476
No.

57:27.920 --> 57:32.516
Are you sure it wasn't Jason
she went with, or Mr. Ward?

57:33.059 --> 57:34.788
Two men?

57:35.895 --> 57:37.487
No.

57:38.665 --> 57:41.498
I'll get home as soon as I can,
Mr. Romari.

57:41.768 --> 57:44.635
The acceptance of a secret
is an obligation.

57:44.904 --> 57:47.600
In this case, the obligation
carried the necessity...

57:47.774 --> 57:51.175
...of dying if one betrayed that secret.
You understand that, don't you?

57:51.744 --> 57:54.679
Yes. I understand it.

57:54.881 --> 57:57.577
Then you also understand
that you must die.

57:58.051 --> 57:59.643
No.

57:59.819 --> 58:02.083
You've spoken so often
of ending it all.

58:02.255 --> 58:05.452
I can't understand why
this should be so difficult for you.

58:05.692 --> 58:08.684
- You have only to drink a little.
- Yes, Jacqueline.

58:08.895 --> 58:13.332
You were always talking suicide,
of ending your life when you wanted to.

58:13.866 --> 58:15.299
Yes.

58:15.968 --> 58:18.436
- When I wanted to.
- It doesn't matter.

58:18.838 --> 58:20.806
You want to now.
You should want to.

58:21.007 --> 58:22.634
It is your obligation, your duty.

58:22.809 --> 58:26.802
You have only to stretch out your hand,
take up the glass and drink a little.

58:27.146 --> 58:28.807
It won't hurt.

58:29.082 --> 58:31.243
No, no, no.

58:32.352 --> 58:35.913
You have a strange kind
of courage, Jason.

58:36.789 --> 58:38.757
Perhaps you have
enough courage to hear...

58:38.925 --> 58:40.984
...what I've kept from you
all these years.

58:41.160 --> 58:42.787
That girl you loved...

58:42.995 --> 58:45.361
...that other patient of mine...

58:46.099 --> 58:47.930
She didn't disappear.

58:48.234 --> 58:52.227
She's in an asylum.
A horrible, raving thing.

58:53.573 --> 58:55.598
I never wanted you to know.

58:56.743 --> 58:58.574
And all the while...

58:59.212 --> 59:00.645
...you've been my friend.

59:12.158 --> 59:13.557
Please...

59:13.993 --> 59:16.188
...may I have a drink of water?

59:16.496 --> 59:18.293
I'm very thirsty.

59:18.965 --> 59:20.398
Drink.

59:20.967 --> 59:22.298
No.

59:22.568 --> 59:26.004
There will be no water, and there'll be
no rest. You may as well drink.

59:32.278 --> 59:34.508
No, no!

59:37.617 --> 59:39.482
If you like, I'll go with you to dinner.

59:39.652 --> 59:41.916
- I'd like that.
- Jason.

59:42.688 --> 59:45.589
I can't find Gregory.
I've been trying to find him.

59:45.758 --> 59:47.123
What's wrong, Mary?

59:47.293 --> 59:49.420
Jacqueline. Mr. Romari phoned me.

59:49.595 --> 59:52.530
She went out this afternoon
with two men he'd never seen before.

59:52.698 --> 59:54.598
- They may have been friends of hers.
- No.

59:54.767 --> 59:56.962
She wouldn't go with anyone
unless compelled.

59:57.136 --> 01:00:00.867
These months of hiding have made her
frightened of the streets and people.

01:00:02.108 --> 01:00:04.576
- I wonder...
- What?

01:00:04.844 --> 01:00:06.436
They may have found her.

01:00:06.612 --> 01:00:08.079
Would they hurt her?

01:00:08.915 --> 01:00:10.405
I don't know.

01:00:10.950 --> 01:00:13.851
You'd better go up to your room
and wait for us, Mary.

01:00:19.559 --> 01:00:21.117
Go ahead, Jacqueline.

01:00:22.829 --> 01:00:24.626
Go ahead.

01:00:29.001 --> 01:00:30.662
It is late.

01:00:32.338 --> 01:00:35.569
Drink it, Jacqueline.
There's nothing else for you to do.

01:00:35.741 --> 01:00:37.174
They say you've got to die.

01:00:37.610 --> 01:00:41.569
Drink it, Jacqueline! You've got to!
I can't stand this!

01:00:54.660 --> 01:00:57.993
No. No, I can't let you die!

01:00:58.164 --> 01:01:03.192
The only time I was ever happy
was when I was working with you.

01:01:03.836 --> 01:01:06.634
You were always so good to me.

01:01:25.591 --> 01:01:26.819
You may go now, Jacqueline.

01:01:27.193 --> 01:01:30.924
The decision was against violence,
but there'll be another decision.

01:01:31.097 --> 01:01:33.190
Today, tomorrow...

01:01:33.633 --> 01:01:36.329
...we'll find you, but now you may go.

01:01:40.673 --> 01:01:42.732
I told you you could go.

01:05:05.811 --> 01:05:08.041
Please help me.
There's a man following me.

01:05:08.214 --> 01:05:10.876
- I shouldn't wonder, babe.
- I'm serious. Help me.

01:05:11.050 --> 01:05:14.383
I'll help you to a beer and a sandwich.
Come along, babe. Come along.

01:06:21.821 --> 01:06:23.254
Who are you?

01:06:24.056 --> 01:06:25.546
I'm Mimi.

01:06:25.825 --> 01:06:27.656
- I'm dying.
- No.

01:06:27.827 --> 01:06:31.126
Yes. I've been quiet.

01:06:31.297 --> 01:06:33.128
Oh, ever so quiet.

01:06:33.299 --> 01:06:35.233
I hardly move.

01:06:35.501 --> 01:06:39.733
And yet it keeps coming
all the time, closer and closer.

01:06:39.905 --> 01:06:42.499
And I rest and I rest...

01:06:42.675 --> 01:06:44.199
...and still I'm dying.

01:06:44.810 --> 01:06:47.040
And you don't wanna die?

01:06:47.613 --> 01:06:49.843
I've always wanted to die.

01:06:50.182 --> 01:06:53.515
- Always.
- I'm afraid.

01:06:54.753 --> 01:06:58.189
And I'm tired of being afraid.
Of waiting.

01:06:58.991 --> 01:07:02.017
- Why wait?
- I'm not going to wait.

01:07:02.328 --> 01:07:05.923
I'm going out, and I'm
going to laugh and dance...

01:07:06.165 --> 01:07:09.066
...and do all the things I used to do.
- And then?

01:07:10.035 --> 01:07:11.764
I don't know.

01:07:14.073 --> 01:07:15.768
You will die.

01:07:36.061 --> 01:07:39.792
Now that you've hounded and worried her
you don't even know where she is.

01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:43.297
At least tell me, has she been here?

01:07:43.469 --> 01:07:46.267
Yes. She left here an hour ago.

01:07:46.505 --> 01:07:49.474
She may even be home by now.
Why don't you try it?

01:07:49.742 --> 01:07:51.539
All right, Jason.

01:07:59.418 --> 01:08:01.318
The devil worshippers.

01:08:01.620 --> 01:08:03.417
The lovers of evil.

01:08:04.757 --> 01:08:06.349
It's a joke.

01:08:06.525 --> 01:08:07.958
Pathetic little joke.

01:08:08.127 --> 01:08:10.095
We haven't asked your opinion.

01:08:10.329 --> 01:08:12.957
I propose to give it to you anyway.

01:08:13.365 --> 01:08:16.357
You're a poor, wretched
group of people who have...

01:08:16.535 --> 01:08:18.127
...taken the wrong turning.

01:08:18.437 --> 01:08:20.131
Wrong?

01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:24.973
Who knows what is wrong or right?

01:08:25.743 --> 01:08:30.113
If I prefer to believe in satanic majesty
and power, who can deny me?

01:08:30.816 --> 01:08:33.841
What proof could you bring
that good is superior to evil?

01:08:34.953 --> 01:08:38.048
It's hard to put into words,
but you're wrong.

01:08:38.223 --> 01:08:39.554
One proof.

01:08:40.426 --> 01:08:41.893
I'll prove you wrong.

01:08:42.060 --> 01:08:44.723
This afternoon Jason and I
were talking together...

01:08:44.997 --> 01:08:47.988
...and I remembered
certain phrases from childhood.

01:08:48.300 --> 01:08:50.495
Simple half-forgotten words.

01:08:50.935 --> 01:08:52.995
It was the Lord's Prayer.

01:08:53.171 --> 01:08:54.502
I'm a physician...

01:08:54.673 --> 01:08:59.474
...yet not I nor any of my colleagues,
no matter how learned...

01:08:59.645 --> 01:09:04.548
...have ever found a substitute for those
words as a rule for human relationship.

01:09:05.149 --> 01:09:07.140
You might remember them.

01:09:07.319 --> 01:09:08.809
Forgive us our trespasses...

01:09:09.621 --> 01:09:11.919
...as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

01:09:13.058 --> 01:09:16.390
There's a sentence for you people
from that same prayer:

01:09:16.562 --> 01:09:19.554
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

01:09:24.603 --> 01:09:26.729
All right, thank you very much.

01:09:30.609 --> 01:09:32.509
That was Dr. Judd, Mary.

01:09:32.678 --> 01:09:35.475
He phoned to say
Jacqueline's on her way here.

01:09:37.216 --> 01:09:39.548
- Gregory.
- Yes?

01:09:39.718 --> 01:09:42.050
You better take Jacqueline
with you tonight.

01:09:42.220 --> 01:09:44.416
That's what I should
have done yesterday.

01:09:44.622 --> 01:09:47.490
I'll take her away someplace
where she can rest.

01:09:49.328 --> 01:09:50.555
Mary.

01:09:50.729 --> 01:09:53.788
No, stay nearby.
I want to talk to you.

01:09:54.733 --> 01:09:56.257
I love you.

01:09:56.635 --> 01:09:59.229
- You know that.
- Yes.

01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:04.575
I've never loved anyone before, Gregory.

01:10:04.843 --> 01:10:06.572
And I do love you.

01:10:06.745 --> 01:10:08.508
You must know that.

01:10:09.448 --> 01:10:11.678
But Jacqueline's my sister...

01:10:11.850 --> 01:10:14.751
...whom I'd lost and found again.

01:10:15.854 --> 01:10:17.481
I know.

01:10:18.057 --> 01:10:22.323
- I shouldn't have told you.
- No, I'm glad.

01:10:22.494 --> 01:10:24.689
At least I've heard you say it.

01:10:35.307 --> 01:10:37.070
<i>I run to death...</i>

01:10:37.409 --> 01:10:39.707
<i>... and death meets me as fast.</i>

01:10:40.879 --> 01:10:43.677
<i>And all my pleasures</i>
<i>are like yesterday.</i>
