02:37.230 --> 02:38.950
Do I seem crazy to you?

02:40.350 --> 02:44.030
Crazy for not having screamed
everything that my breast yearns for?

02:44.600 --> 02:45.990
They are coming!

03:13.230 --> 03:16.490
I have to contain myself
so as not to stab you with...

03:19.640 --> 03:20.850
Let her go!

03:22.430 --> 03:24.440
I came so she could kill me.

03:33.350 --> 03:35.740
Because I went with
the other one.

03:37.230 --> 03:38.320
I went.

03:45.390 --> 03:47.440
You would have done the same.

03:49.640 --> 03:51.640
I was a woman scorned,

03:52.930 --> 03:55.440
full of shame both inside and out.

03:58.560 --> 03:59.900
And your son...

04:02.850 --> 04:05.280
Your son he was the hope...

04:05.350 --> 04:10.490
I had for children,
for land... for strength.

04:12.480 --> 04:13.900
But the other,

04:15.600 --> 04:18.490
the other was a dark river,
full of bracken,

04:21.140 --> 04:23.890
that brought me the murmur
of it's reeds

04:24.230 --> 04:26.820
and song between clenched teeth.

04:32.520 --> 04:34.070
I didn't want to...

04:35.100 --> 04:38.240
Do you hear me? I didn't want to...

04:40.180 --> 04:42.270
Your son was my life.

04:44.890 --> 04:48.190
But the embrace of another
dragged me down like a tidal wave.

04:49.230 --> 04:51.650
Like the butt of a mule...

04:52.180 --> 04:54.530
And he could have dragged
me down forever.

04:56.480 --> 04:57.860
Forever...

05:00.060 --> 05:01.400
Forever...

07:23.180 --> 07:26.890
<i>Out of the four muleteers.</i>

07:27.640 --> 07:31.690
<i>Out of the four muleteers.</i>

07:31.730 --> 07:34.900
<i>Out of the four muleteers.</i>

07:35.350 --> 07:38.599
<i>Oh mommy, going to the water,</i>

07:38.600 --> 07:40.860
<i>going to the water.</i>

07:42.390 --> 07:46.350
<i>The one on the dapple-grey mule.</i>

07:46.770 --> 07:50.320
<i>The one on the dapple-grey mule.</i>

07:50.480 --> 07:53.139
<i>The one on the dapple-grey mule.</i>

07:53.140 --> 07:57.639
<i>Oh mommy, is stealing my soul,</i>

07:57.640 --> 08:00.020
<i>is stealing my soul.</i>

08:00.140 --> 08:04.730
<i>It is raining in the fields.</i>

08:04.810 --> 08:08.240
<i>It is raining in the fields.</i>

08:08.560 --> 08:11.990
<i>Oh mommy, my love gets wet,</i>

08:12.390 --> 08:14.600
<i>my love gets wet.</i>

08:15.730 --> 08:19.530
<i>Who could be a little tree.</i>

08:20.270 --> 08:23.450
<i>Who could be a little tree.</i>

08:24.640 --> 08:28.560
<i>Oh mommy, full of leaves,</i>

08:28.560 --> 08:30.650
<i>full of leaves.</i>

08:31.890 --> 08:36.480
<i>Ay, better keep quiet.</i>

08:46.060 --> 08:47.070
Whoa!

09:03.980 --> 09:06.240
What are you doing?
They will see us...

09:06.430 --> 09:07.810
Get off, get off...

09:12.480 --> 09:16.280
Stop, no, no, no stop!

09:16.600 --> 09:17.950
No, no, no...!

09:25.600 --> 09:28.900
Look young one,
the tablecloths have arrived.

09:31.890 --> 09:34.429
Have you ever seen such linen?

09:34.430 --> 09:35.890
And the embroidery?

09:37.310 --> 09:39.269
- You can tell it's your mother's work.
- My mother!

09:39.270 --> 09:42.170
I am going to fetch
her before she notices I am late.

10:00.390 --> 10:04.390
<i>Lullaby, baby, lullaby...</i>

10:05.480 --> 10:09.820
<i>About the horse...</i>

10:11.390 --> 10:15.230
that didn't want to drink...

10:25.430 --> 10:28.060
Look... an apple.

10:29.100 --> 10:30.820
He is perfect today.

10:31.930 --> 10:33.140
And you?

10:34.350 --> 10:35.349
I have spent two months

10:35.350 --> 10:38.800
putting new shoes on the horse
and they are always coming loose.

10:42.560 --> 10:44.900
The stones pull them off.

10:50.770 --> 10:52.990
Or maybe it is just overworked?

10:53.680 --> 10:54.770
No.

10:57.640 --> 10:59.640
I don't use him that much.

11:02.180 --> 11:06.280
The neighbours told me that yesterday
they saw you on the edge of the plains;

11:07.770 --> 11:09.450
- was that you?
- No.

11:13.390 --> 11:14.350
Hey...

11:15.770 --> 11:18.070
I was with the wheat overseers.

11:19.100 --> 11:21.000
They are always so entertaining.

11:23.810 --> 11:25.700
I need a new dress.

11:26.390 --> 11:30.270
- And the baby a new cap.
- So who has been racing that horse?

11:31.560 --> 11:34.349
He is downstairs with his eyes
popping out his head,

11:34.350 --> 11:36.650
like he has seen
the end of the world.

11:37.430 --> 11:38.690
Me...

11:39.730 --> 11:41.360
I did that.

11:41.930 --> 11:43.100
Of course.

11:44.270 --> 11:45.700
He's yours.

11:51.980 --> 11:54.900
Did you know they are asking
for my cousin's hand?

11:55.430 --> 11:56.690
When?

11:59.270 --> 12:00.400
Today.

12:01.230 --> 12:04.880
I think the mother of the groom
is not very happy about the wedding.

12:05.020 --> 12:07.820
She's right.
That girl can't be trusted.

12:54.140 --> 12:55.310
My daughter.

12:56.520 --> 12:57.700
Father...

13:02.350 --> 13:03.820
Are you happy?

13:06.520 --> 13:08.400
The wine is here.

13:09.060 --> 13:10.200
I'm coming.

13:24.060 --> 13:26.320
Congratulations young one,

13:27.730 --> 13:29.450
on your engagement...

13:32.350 --> 13:34.849
- Thank you.
- What's the matter child?

13:34.850 --> 13:36.650
Aren't you happy?

13:39.390 --> 13:42.140
- Who are you?
- I bring you a gift...

13:42.270 --> 13:43.950
and some advice.

13:44.480 --> 13:45.650
What?

14:00.770 --> 14:02.650
With a knife,

14:03.730 --> 14:07.530
with a small knife
that barely fits in your hand,

14:09.480 --> 14:13.740
but cuts like ice,
into astonished flesh,

14:14.270 --> 14:16.280
and there it stays,

14:16.810 --> 14:24.490
where the dark root of the scream
quivers and snarls.

14:26.350 --> 14:29.700
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

14:30.140 --> 14:33.440
Don't get married,
if you don't love him.

14:38.270 --> 14:40.650
Get out... get out of this house!

15:27.810 --> 15:33.450
<i>Lullaby, my baby, lullaby</i>

15:37.560 --> 15:47.280
<i>once there was a big horse</i>

15:51.270 --> 15:58.570
<i>who didn't like water</i>

16:01.680 --> 16:08.730
<i>Who didn't like water</i>

16:11.640 --> 16:17.940
<i>The water was black there</i>

16:20.230 --> 16:26.610
<i>under the branches</i>

16:29.060 --> 16:35.860
<i>When it reached the bridge</i>

16:37.770 --> 16:44.740
<i>it stopped and it sang</i>

17:00.060 --> 17:06.819
<i>Who can say, my baby,</i>

17:10.310 --> 17:17.780
<i>what the stream holds</i>

17:20.849 --> 17:27.609
<i>with it's long tail</i>

17:30.230 --> 17:37.900
<i>in it's green parlor</i>

18:28.020 --> 18:29.110
How are you?

18:30.980 --> 18:33.130
I closed up shop and came to see you.

18:33.680 --> 18:35.309
We live so far from each other!

18:35.310 --> 18:37.639
It's been 20 years since
I went to the top end of the street.

18:37.640 --> 18:40.310
- Are you ok?
- What do you think?

18:41.520 --> 18:43.809
Two days ago they brought
in my neighbour's son

18:43.810 --> 18:46.360
with his two arms
cut up by the machine.

18:46.680 --> 18:47.890
Rafael?

18:48.560 --> 18:51.780
Yes, and there he is.

18:54.140 --> 18:57.230
I think about my son often,
and yours...

18:57.930 --> 19:00.810
they are better off where they are.
Sleeping,

19:02.810 --> 19:04.700
- resting.
- Enough!

19:05.350 --> 19:08.280
That is conjecture, it doesn't help.

19:08.560 --> 19:09.849
Months have passed

19:09.850 --> 19:13.500
and my still sadness stings my eyes
and even the strands of my hair.

19:14.060 --> 19:18.360
When I finally got to see my son,
I soaked my hands in his blood...

19:20.140 --> 19:22.519
and then licked them with my tongue.

19:22.520 --> 19:25.740
Because he was mine.
You wouldn't understand that...

19:25.890 --> 19:28.480
- Madam!
- I will never be still.

19:34.600 --> 19:36.450
You still have one left.

19:38.020 --> 19:39.740
Think about it.

19:39.890 --> 19:42.429
What are you doing here instead
of coming with me to the vineyards?

19:42.430 --> 19:44.269
And what would an old woman
do in a vineyard?

19:44.270 --> 19:45.450
Old?

19:46.600 --> 19:49.200
Old? Yes, so, so old!

19:51.310 --> 19:53.860
Your father used to take me there...

19:53.890 --> 19:56.059
So he finally bought that vineyard?

19:56.060 --> 19:57.400
He got lucky.

19:57.640 --> 19:59.480
Now he's getting married.

20:01.230 --> 20:03.429
Do you know my son's fiancée?

20:03.430 --> 20:04.889
She's a fine girl.

20:04.890 --> 20:06.350
Yes, but...

20:08.680 --> 20:11.020
You can never know
anyone deep inside.

20:11.270 --> 20:12.780
But she's nice.

20:12.930 --> 20:16.940
She lives alone with her father
out there, so far away...

20:17.480 --> 20:19.450
she's used to solitude.

20:20.060 --> 20:21.610
And her mother?

20:21.730 --> 20:24.280
She was beautiful.
But I never liked her.

20:25.060 --> 20:28.019
- She didn't love her husband.
- But everyone knows too much!

20:28.020 --> 20:29.900
You were the one who asked!

20:30.140 --> 20:31.940
Has she ever had a boyfriend?

20:33.020 --> 20:34.990
When she was 15 years old.

20:35.230 --> 20:38.240
But a few years ago he got married
to her cousin.

20:38.480 --> 20:41.430
- Nobody remembers the engagement...
- And who was he?

20:42.770 --> 20:43.929
Leonardo.

20:43.930 --> 20:45.310
Which Leonardo?

20:48.060 --> 20:49.490
Leonardo Felix.

20:52.310 --> 20:53.570
Felix!

20:59.640 --> 21:02.100
You know that my financée
is a good girl.

21:02.980 --> 21:04.780
- Yes.
- So?

21:05.230 --> 21:07.740
Yes... I am not sure what I am saying.

21:07.770 --> 21:10.309
I know that she is hard-working and good.
But despite that,

21:10.310 --> 21:13.820
when you mention her name
it's like throwing a rock at my head.

21:14.270 --> 21:15.450
I should go.

21:15.810 --> 21:18.460
My people from the fields
will be arriving soon.

21:20.980 --> 21:23.519
Don't get in the way
of your son's happiness.

21:23.520 --> 21:25.900
It's time for us to step back now.

21:32.350 --> 21:35.200
Don't pay heed.
I know you will love my fiancée.

21:36.850 --> 21:38.110
I will.

21:40.890 --> 21:43.600
It's just that... I will be alone.

21:43.930 --> 21:45.690
First it was your father...

21:47.640 --> 21:51.480
whom I loved with all my heart.
And that lasted barely three years.

21:52.020 --> 21:53.570
Then your brother...

21:57.350 --> 21:59.530
and now there is only you.

22:00.640 --> 22:02.310
I don't want you to go.

22:07.600 --> 22:09.280
Yes, yes, yes...

22:10.730 --> 22:12.900
I know you are too old for kisses.

22:13.230 --> 22:15.389
Let's see if you lighten up my life
with six grandchildren.

22:15.390 --> 22:18.980
Or however many you want.
Your father never gave me any.

22:19.230 --> 22:20.990
The first one for you.

22:21.520 --> 22:24.099
- But let it be a girl.
- Get ready.

22:24.100 --> 22:26.200
It's a long road ahead.

22:31.100 --> 22:32.150
Go!

23:30.930 --> 23:33.480
- Was it a long trip?
- Four hours.

23:33.730 --> 23:36.030
Well you took the long road.

23:37.060 --> 23:39.780
I am too old to travel
by the river banks.

23:39.890 --> 23:41.270
She gets dizzy.

23:43.100 --> 23:44.360
Come in.

23:46.180 --> 23:47.809
Nice crop of esparto grass.

23:47.810 --> 23:50.769
In my time, there was no esparto
grass around here.

23:50.770 --> 23:55.929
Now we need to beat it with a stick
almost, to get anything out of it.

23:55.930 --> 23:58.389
But now it is giving you a return.
Stop complaining.

23:58.390 --> 24:00.429
I haven't come to ask you
for anything.

24:00.430 --> 24:01.979
You are richer than I am.

24:01.980 --> 24:04.900
Vineyards are worth
a pretty penny. Wine?

24:05.390 --> 24:06.560
No...

24:08.640 --> 24:11.730
I am just sorry that our lands
are separate.

24:11.980 --> 24:16.559
If only we could bring your vineyards
here with 20 pairs of oxen

24:16.560 --> 24:18.769
and put them together on the slope.

24:18.770 --> 24:20.429
- What joy!
- What for?

24:20.430 --> 24:23.479
When I die, you'll sell it
and buy the land next door.

24:23.480 --> 24:28.280
Sell? Why? no!
I would buy it, buy it all.

24:39.140 --> 24:42.810
Son, go fetch her.
We have things to talk about.

24:58.680 --> 25:01.270
- You know why I have come.
- Yes.

25:01.520 --> 25:02.700
And?

25:03.020 --> 25:06.030
It seems like a good idea,
they have spoken about it.

25:08.520 --> 25:10.700
My son is willing and able.

25:10.930 --> 25:12.810
So is my daughter.

25:20.480 --> 25:21.740
Greetings...

25:25.350 --> 25:26.700
Come closer.

25:33.930 --> 25:35.560
Are you happy?

25:36.140 --> 25:38.560
- Yes, yes I am.
- Of course you are.

25:41.060 --> 25:42.400
Look at me.

25:47.930 --> 25:50.520
She looks so much like my wife did.

25:55.100 --> 25:56.990
How lovely you are!

25:58.430 --> 26:00.980
Do you understand
what marriage means child?

26:01.890 --> 26:03.019
Yes, madam.

26:03.020 --> 26:07.990
A husband, children and a two-yard
thick wall between everything else.

26:10.730 --> 26:12.530
I will not disappoint.

26:12.680 --> 26:15.350
Of course, of course you won't.

26:17.890 --> 26:19.850
Here are your gifts.

26:23.310 --> 26:24.450
Thank you.

26:28.810 --> 26:29.950
Come.

26:35.520 --> 26:38.150
My mother wanted me
to give you this present.

26:46.680 --> 26:48.100
They are antique.

26:49.060 --> 26:50.450
Made of brass.

26:52.100 --> 26:53.530
Do you like them?

27:05.310 --> 27:08.019
When I am by your side
I feel so proud.

27:08.020 --> 27:09.809
It brings a lump to my throat.

27:09.810 --> 27:12.490
When we are married
that will disappear.

27:15.140 --> 27:18.140
I am longing to be your wife,
to be alone with you...

27:19.140 --> 27:21.730
and not hear anyone
else's voice but yours.

27:22.770 --> 27:25.070
And only see your eyes.

27:26.350 --> 27:28.860
You hold me so tight, so tight,

27:30.930 --> 27:33.729
that if it were my mother
herself calling me,

27:33.730 --> 27:35.780
I couldn't let you go.

27:46.680 --> 27:48.390
I have strong arms.

27:48.640 --> 27:51.440
I will hold you for forty years
without letting go.

28:17.350 --> 28:21.700
<i>Skein, skein,</i>

28:22.350 --> 28:25.650
<i>what would you be?</i>

28:26.930 --> 28:30.640
<i>Dress of jasmine,</i>

28:31.730 --> 28:34.780
<i>tie of cristal.</i>

28:36.350 --> 28:41.240
<i>To be born at four,</i>

28:42.310 --> 28:45.280
<i>and to die at ten.</i>

28:45.930 --> 28:50.440
<i>A strand of wool,</i>

28:51.310 --> 28:54.990
<i>a chain at your feet,</i>

28:55.890 --> 28:58.980
<i>and a knot to bind</i>

28:59.520 --> 29:03.860
<i>the bitter laurel.</i>

29:05.350 --> 29:10.110
<i>Skein, skein,</i>

29:10.980 --> 29:14.530
<i>what would you say?</i>

29:15.350 --> 29:20.400
<i>A voiceless lover.</i>

29:21.520 --> 29:25.990
<i>A crimson husband.</i>

29:27.930 --> 29:29.479
You can't be inside in this heat.

29:29.480 --> 29:32.450
These lands don't cool down,
even at dawn.

29:36.770 --> 29:40.179
My mother was from a very green place.
From rich lands.

29:40.180 --> 29:42.560
She would have been happy there.

29:42.930 --> 29:44.020
Yes.

29:45.480 --> 29:47.530
But this place ate her up.

29:48.230 --> 29:50.110
As it does all of us.

29:50.730 --> 29:52.110
Destiny.

29:53.640 --> 29:54.810
Destiny.

29:58.600 --> 30:02.500
- The walls feel like they are on fire.
- You are going to look gorgeous.

30:02.980 --> 30:06.820
Oh lucky you, who is going
to embrace a man,

30:07.020 --> 30:10.639
kiss him, feel his weight by your side.

30:10.640 --> 30:11.850
Stop...

30:11.890 --> 30:16.100
The best is when you wake up,
when you feel him by your side and you

30:16.430 --> 30:19.560
- brush his shoulders with your breath.
- That's enough!

30:19.730 --> 30:20.979
But girl!

30:20.980 --> 30:25.400
That is what a wedding is,
and nothing more.

30:26.730 --> 30:29.860
A wedding is a bed, a man...

30:32.020 --> 30:33.530
and a woman.

30:34.640 --> 30:36.980
Don't overthink it.

30:38.140 --> 30:40.440
Or do you have your reasons?

30:41.310 --> 30:44.510
Could it be that you don't want
to get married? Say so now!

30:45.270 --> 30:47.450
You can still turn back.

30:49.140 --> 30:50.890
I just feel foggy.

30:52.140 --> 30:54.440
The stale air around here.

30:54.640 --> 30:56.850
Who doesn't have their doubts?

30:56.890 --> 30:58.890
Do you love your fiancée?

31:02.680 --> 31:05.440
Yes, of course I do.

31:13.310 --> 31:17.490
<i>A voiceless lover.</i>

31:18.680 --> 31:23.350
<i>A crimson husband.</i>

33:05.520 --> 33:07.720
- Long live the newlyweds!
- Long live!

33:10.520 --> 33:12.720
- Long live the newlyweds!
- Long live!

33:12.980 --> 33:15.180
- Long live the newlyweds!
- Long live!

33:32.390 --> 33:35.390
- They are also here?
- They are family.

33:36.180 --> 33:38.639
- Today is a day to forgive.
- I can bare them.

33:38.640 --> 33:41.390
- But I won't forgive them.
- Give it up...

33:42.890 --> 33:45.480
What has Leonardo ever done?

33:45.770 --> 33:46.900
True.

33:47.270 --> 33:51.220
But when I hear the name Felix, you
might as well fill my mouth with silt.

33:51.350 --> 33:54.400
- I have to spit so as not to kill...
- Behave yourself.

33:54.810 --> 33:56.400
What good will it do?

33:56.640 --> 33:59.520
None. But you understand.

34:01.480 --> 34:03.820
Can you bring anyone
back from the dead?

34:06.060 --> 34:07.530
And they preside.

34:07.680 --> 34:11.060
What does it mean to preside?
There they eat, smoke...

34:14.520 --> 34:16.309
You are right,
I need to keep my mouth shut.

34:16.310 --> 34:17.599
People will talk...

34:17.600 --> 34:20.030
What joy! My children!

34:21.230 --> 34:22.530
What joy!

34:28.600 --> 34:30.530
You look beautiful.

34:33.270 --> 34:34.860
Congratulations son.

34:42.020 --> 34:44.239
- There is much to celebrate.
- Yes.

35:35.100 --> 35:36.280
Thank you.

35:39.480 --> 35:42.280
- Let's go.
- No. You go ahead.

35:51.770 --> 35:52.950
Gorgeous!

36:11.310 --> 36:12.860
Congratulations.

36:23.100 --> 36:24.530
Why did you come?

36:26.480 --> 36:28.320
To see your wedding.

36:31.430 --> 36:32.979
I also saw yours.

36:32.980 --> 36:34.729
Still yearning for you.

36:34.730 --> 36:35.950
Lies.

36:40.730 --> 36:42.150
And your wife?

36:42.730 --> 36:45.150
This conversation has to stop.

36:49.850 --> 36:52.360
How come we can't talk to each other?

36:53.020 --> 36:54.360
She is right.

36:54.770 --> 36:57.610
- I shouldn't be talking to you.
- Hey, let's go!

37:00.020 --> 37:01.240
Let's go!

37:27.770 --> 37:30.150
What was I to you?

37:31.730 --> 37:32.900
Tell me.

37:33.140 --> 37:34.730
Think hard.

37:35.890 --> 37:38.480
Two mules and a run-down
shack wasn't much.

37:42.100 --> 37:43.610
Almost nothing at all.

37:45.020 --> 37:47.610
Go and wait for your wife
by the door.

37:50.230 --> 37:51.530
And the bride?

38:00.890 --> 38:05.270
After I got married I thought night
and day about whose fault it was,

38:05.270 --> 38:09.280
and each time the guilty
part swapped.

38:31.020 --> 38:32.860
But fault there was.

38:38.230 --> 38:39.570
It's too late.

38:49.680 --> 38:52.100
A man with a horse is wise...

38:54.640 --> 38:59.310
and capable enough to wrench out
a young girl stuck in the desert.

39:01.890 --> 39:03.730
But I have my pride.

39:04.930 --> 39:06.639
And that's why I got married.

39:06.640 --> 39:10.890
I will wall myself in with my husband,
whom I will love for the rest of my life.

39:12.230 --> 39:14.280
Pride won't help you.

39:18.100 --> 39:19.740
Don't come near me.

39:20.810 --> 39:25.570
Bitterness is the worst
punishment of all.

39:27.640 --> 39:31.269
What good does pride
do if I can't gaze at you,

39:31.270 --> 39:34.200
if I leave you lying awake
night after night?

39:39.850 --> 39:41.320
Nothing at all!

39:45.640 --> 39:47.480
Have you seen my husband?

39:52.310 --> 39:54.570
Wait here, I will look for him.

40:01.560 --> 40:04.740
You think that time heals
and walls shield,

40:06.140 --> 40:09.640
it's not true, it's not true.

40:11.140 --> 40:14.940
When things come to a head,
there is no-one pulling them up.

40:19.270 --> 40:21.990
I can't hear you,
I can't hear your voice.

40:23.180 --> 40:28.600
It's like I have drunk a bottle of anis
and I am sleeping on a bed of roses.

40:32.890 --> 40:36.440
They drag and drown me,

40:37.680 --> 40:39.350
but I swim back.

40:40.100 --> 40:41.900
Child... Child...

40:45.180 --> 40:46.940
I know I am crazy...

40:49.230 --> 40:51.740
and my heart is rotting
from holding on...

40:52.140 --> 40:54.270
You have to go right now.

40:55.270 --> 40:58.110
This will be the last time
I talk to her.

41:09.640 --> 41:11.100
I got married,

41:12.480 --> 41:14.200
you got married.

41:17.560 --> 41:19.150
It is done.

41:29.520 --> 41:31.530
Change that face...

41:36.430 --> 41:37.770
You go ahead.

41:39.230 --> 41:40.700
I'll go on horseback.

41:46.390 --> 41:48.520
Why are you looking at me like that?

41:48.850 --> 41:51.070
You sting me with your eyes.

41:51.350 --> 41:52.780
Let's go.

42:01.230 --> 42:03.080
I don't know what is happening.

42:06.310 --> 42:07.860
But I am thinking.

42:11.850 --> 42:13.700
And I don't want to think.

42:28.350 --> 42:30.360
But there is one thing I know.

42:33.100 --> 42:35.150
I am done with.

42:39.810 --> 42:41.360
And I have a child.

42:43.310 --> 42:45.280
And another on the way.

42:45.850 --> 42:47.900
Come on child.

42:48.770 --> 42:51.110
Your husband is waiting for you.

42:56.980 --> 42:58.700
Let's go! Let's go!

44:47.520 --> 44:49.400
Long live the newlyweds!

45:18.520 --> 45:21.700
Kiss her! Kiss her!

45:28.810 --> 45:31.929
Again, again, again!

45:31.930 --> 45:34.100
Again, again!

45:46.140 --> 45:47.310
Lets eat!

46:04.770 --> 46:06.030
Let's see...

46:32.430 --> 46:33.940
Thank you!

46:34.310 --> 46:36.650
- There...
- Thank you.

46:45.480 --> 46:46.820
Let me...

46:51.180 --> 46:52.980
I don't want to interrupt.

46:58.640 --> 47:00.440
Excuse me for a moment.

47:02.230 --> 47:03.450
Cousin...

47:10.680 --> 47:12.140
Congratulations.

47:12.230 --> 47:13.530
Thank you.

47:17.270 --> 47:18.900
How lovely he is.

47:20.060 --> 47:21.900
He looks like his father.

47:30.270 --> 47:31.990
Thank you for coming.

47:42.730 --> 47:44.490
The dagger, the dagger...

47:44.770 --> 47:47.530
Damn them all and the crook
that invented them.

47:47.930 --> 47:51.179
And the rifles and guns
and the smallest knife there is...

47:51.180 --> 47:52.479
Enough...

47:52.480 --> 47:55.820
All that can cut the flesh of a man,
a beautiful man...

47:56.770 --> 47:58.979
- in the prime of his life.
- Mama, be quiet.

47:58.980 --> 48:01.889
That came out of the vines,
and he didn't come back.

48:01.890 --> 48:03.390
Are you finished?

48:12.680 --> 48:13.770
Let's drink!

48:15.850 --> 48:17.280
That's what I like.

48:17.430 --> 48:20.349
Men who are men
and wheat that is wheat.

48:20.350 --> 48:23.479
<i>The olive tree, the olive tree.</i>

48:23.480 --> 48:27.180
<i>- I climbed the olive tree.</i>
- Mother, how long since you have danced?

48:27.230 --> 48:33.610
<i>And while cutting a branch
I fell from the olive tree.</i>

48:34.230 --> 48:37.599
<i>I fell from the olive tree,</i>

48:37.600 --> 48:41.030
<i>who will help me get up?</i>

48:41.140 --> 48:44.269
<i>A girl with dark hair</i>

48:44.270 --> 48:47.950
<i>offering her hand.</i>

48:48.350 --> 48:51.280
I have never seen
so many people at a wedding.

48:51.770 --> 48:54.729
You father laid many seeds,
now you reap the benefits.

48:54.730 --> 48:57.729
<i>A girl with dark hair,</i>

48:57.730 --> 49:02.200
<i>that is what I want for me!</i>

49:04.060 --> 49:05.360
Thank you!

49:07.560 --> 49:10.240
<i>Tarara wears</i>

49:10.770 --> 49:13.320
<i>a green dress</i>

49:13.980 --> 49:16.360
<i>full of ruffles</i>

49:16.520 --> 49:19.280
<i>and of jingle bells.</i>

49:19.890 --> 49:24.179
<i>Tarara yes,</i>

49:24.180 --> 49:27.310
<i>Tarara no,</i>

49:28.060 --> 49:34.490
<i>Tarara, a girl that has
caught my eye</i>

49:35.060 --> 49:38.269
<i>Tarara wears</i>

49:38.270 --> 49:40.889
<i>a pair of trousers</i>

49:40.890 --> 49:46.190
<i>that from top to bottom
are all buttons.</i>

49:46.930 --> 49:50.850
<i>Tarara yes,</i>

49:51.980 --> 49:55.450
<i>Tarara no,</i>

49:56.100 --> 50:02.610
<i>Tarara, a girl that has
caught my eye</i>

50:08.680 --> 50:10.889
<i>Aii, you crazy Tarara</i>

50:10.890 --> 50:13.389
<i>Move your waist</i>

50:13.390 --> 50:15.809
<i>for the boys</i>

50:15.810 --> 50:18.269
<i>of the olive trees</i>

50:18.270 --> 50:22.929
<i>Tarara yes, Tarara no,</i>

50:22.930 --> 50:24.850
What's the matter woman?

50:25.270 --> 50:28.740
They are happy.
Today everyone is happy.

50:29.850 --> 50:30.889
No.

50:30.890 --> 50:32.730
I am alone in my house.

50:33.430 --> 50:36.730
At least they will give us sons.
And maybe a daughter!

50:37.100 --> 50:39.280
It's only a matter of time.

50:40.140 --> 50:43.270
My daughter has good hips,
and your son is strong.

50:43.310 --> 50:48.530
<i>Tarara, a girl that has
caught my eye.</i>

50:51.850 --> 50:53.450
Be happy!

50:54.180 --> 50:58.100
For those that are here,
and those that aren't.

51:00.100 --> 51:02.990
- Long live the newlyweds!
- Long live!

51:04.310 --> 51:05.900
Be happy...

51:19.520 --> 51:20.700
I love you.

51:22.730 --> 51:24.030
I love you.

51:26.560 --> 51:28.490
Hold me and don't let go.

51:32.230 --> 51:33.650
I won't.

53:02.600 --> 53:05.740
I had that thorn in my side,
now it has gone.

53:06.020 --> 53:09.139
At last our lands will be united.

53:09.140 --> 53:11.840
- What are your talking about father?
- Leonardo.

53:12.060 --> 53:14.960
- What about Leonardo?
- You will have a good legacy!

53:15.520 --> 53:19.950
That small orchard that was wedged
between my fields, at last I sold it.

53:21.140 --> 53:24.179
He says that he wants to get out of here,
that there is nothing left here for him.

53:24.180 --> 53:27.330
He is leaving, with his wife
and his son to the mountains.

53:35.600 --> 53:36.990
What's the matter?

53:38.310 --> 53:40.450
- It's nothing father.
- Look at you!

53:40.850 --> 53:43.650
If your mother could see
you she would be so happy.

53:43.810 --> 53:45.110
Do you think so?

53:50.890 --> 53:52.190
Where are you going?

53:52.230 --> 53:55.280
- Should I go with you?
- No, stay here with the others.

55:56.560 --> 55:59.610
<i>That moon...</i>

56:02.390 --> 56:05.480
<i>That moon...</i>

56:08.930 --> 56:13.640
<i>The moon leaves a knife</i>

56:15.310 --> 56:19.740
<i>abandoned in the air,</i>

56:22.270 --> 56:26.360
<i>that, being a lead threat,</i>

56:26.810 --> 56:31.860
<i>lusts after bloody pain.</i>

57:00.180 --> 57:01.890
Let me come in.

57:02.430 --> 57:06.140
I come frozen through
walls and windows!

57:07.180 --> 57:11.890
Open the roofs and breasts
where I can warm up!

57:17.390 --> 57:20.270
I am cold, I am cold...

57:20.980 --> 57:22.530
I am cold.

57:25.230 --> 57:28.530
My ashes of somnolent metals

57:28.810 --> 57:31.360
search for the fire's crest...

57:32.140 --> 57:34.980
in the woods and in the streets.

57:35.930 --> 57:40.480
Well this night there will be
red blood in my cheeks...

57:41.930 --> 57:46.600
and on the reeds that will be clustered
at the wide feet of the wind.

57:47.680 --> 57:51.810
There is no shadow, nor ambush...

57:52.140 --> 57:54.890
that can't escape.

57:56.270 --> 57:58.950
I want to enter into a breast...

57:59.560 --> 58:02.269
that will give me warmth.

58:02.270 --> 58:04.490
A heart for me...

58:05.270 --> 58:06.860
a warm heart.

58:08.520 --> 58:12.240
I want to wander
the mounts of my breast.

58:13.980 --> 58:15.860
Let me in...

58:20.810 --> 58:22.280
Let me...

58:25.140 --> 58:26.440
Daughter!

58:31.560 --> 58:33.280
What are you doing here?

58:35.520 --> 58:37.400
What are you doing here?

58:40.890 --> 58:42.980
What is wrong, my child?

58:43.520 --> 58:46.200
I am afraid, I am afraid father...

58:46.640 --> 58:51.480
We all are, but don't tell your husband.
We should all be happy.

58:53.390 --> 58:55.890
Do you know how much
this wedding cost?

58:58.100 --> 58:59.530
Yes... I do.

58:59.890 --> 59:03.019
Well... let's go inside.
Let's enjoy it while we can.

59:03.020 --> 59:06.400
They are already leaving
for the lower plains...

59:06.640 --> 59:08.480
You first father...

59:15.430 --> 59:17.190
- Don't be long...
- I won't.

01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:06.490
All will go well.

01:00:10.270 --> 01:00:12.320
No more bitter faces.

01:00:18.930 --> 01:00:20.190
No more.

01:00:21.180 --> 01:00:23.810
No more galloping off
on the big horse.

01:00:24.430 --> 01:00:25.730
No more.

01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:33.990
Do you remember our wedding?

01:00:37.980 --> 01:00:42.450
I left my home...
with my mouth wide open.

01:01:01.180 --> 01:01:05.980
<i>Says the bride-to-be
How do you say head</i>

01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:11.479
<i>It is not called head
But wide fields</i>

01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:13.599
<i>Oh my wide fields</i>

01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:17.070
<i>Let the bride enter
And kiss the groom</i>

01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:19.809
<i>Says the bride-to-be</i>

01:01:19.810 --> 01:01:23.700
<i>How do you say hair</i>

01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:30.139
<i>It is not called hair
But dark silk</i>

01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:32.019
<i>Oh my dark silk</i>

01:01:32.020 --> 01:01:34.099
<i>Oh my wide fields</i>

01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:38.490
<i>Let the bride enter
And kiss the groom</i>

01:01:40.020 --> 01:01:44.990
<i>Says the bride-to-be
How do you say forehead</i>

01:01:46.930 --> 01:01:50.019
<i>It is not called forehead
But gleaming sword</i>

01:01:50.020 --> 01:01:51.889
<i>Oh my gleaming sword</i>

01:01:51.890 --> 01:01:53.389
<i>Oh my dark silk</i>

01:01:53.390 --> 01:01:55.269
<i>Oh my wide fields</i>

01:01:55.270 --> 01:01:58.599
<i>Let the bride enter
And take the groom</i>

01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:02.240
<i>The Bride, The Groom</i>

01:02:02.430 --> 01:02:07.520
<i>Says the bride-to-be
How do you say eyebrows</i>

01:02:09.310 --> 01:02:12.349
<i>They are not called eyebrows
But sewing ribbon</i>

01:02:12.350 --> 01:02:14.059
<i>Oh my sewing ribbon</i>

01:02:14.060 --> 01:02:15.769
<i>Oh my gleaming sword</i>

01:02:15.770 --> 01:02:17.389
<i>Oh my dark silk</i>

01:02:17.390 --> 01:02:19.309
<i>Oh my wide fields</i>

01:02:19.310 --> 01:02:22.530
<i>Let the bride enter
And kiss the groom</i>

01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:26.150
<i>The Bride, The Groom</i>

01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:43.479
<i>Says the bride-to-be
How do you say eyes</i>

01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:45.269
<i>The eyes</i>

01:02:45.270 --> 01:02:47.769
<i>They are not called eyes
But rich viewers</i>

01:02:47.770 --> 01:02:49.309
<i>Oh my rich viewers</i>

01:02:49.310 --> 01:02:50.729
<i>Oh my sewing ribbon</i>

01:02:50.730 --> 01:02:52.099
<i>Oh my gleaming sword</i>

01:02:52.100 --> 01:02:53.559
<i>Oh my dark silk</i>

01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:55.099
<i>Oh my wide fields</i>

01:02:55.100 --> 01:02:58.019
<i>Let the bride enter
And kiss the groom</i>

01:02:58.020 --> 01:03:01.019
<i>The Bride, The Groom</i>

01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:04.769
<i>Says the bride-to-be
How do you say face</i>

01:03:04.770 --> 01:03:06.309
<i>The face</i>

01:03:06.310 --> 01:03:08.809
<i>It is not called face
But rose from the Bush</i>

01:03:08.810 --> 01:03:10.559
<i>Oh my rose from the Bush</i>

01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:13.809
<i>Oh my rich viewers
Oh my sewing ribbon</i>

01:03:13.810 --> 01:03:16.479
<i>Oh my gleaming sword
Oh my dark silk</i>

01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:18.099
<i>Oh my wide fields</i>

01:03:18.100 --> 01:03:20.559
<i>Let the bride enter
And kiss the groom</i>

01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:22.849
<i>The Bride, The Groom</i>

01:03:22.850 --> 01:03:25.019
<i>The Bride, The Groom</i>

01:03:25.020 --> 01:03:27.269
<i>The Bride, The Groom</i>

01:03:27.270 --> 01:03:29.519
<i>The Bride, The Groom</i>

01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:31.809
<i>The Bride, The Groom</i>

01:03:31.810 --> 01:03:34.099
<i>The Bride, The Groom</i>

01:03:34.100 --> 01:03:36.309
<i>The Bride, The Groom</i>

01:03:36.310 --> 01:03:38.740
<i>The Bride, The Groom</i>

01:03:38.770 --> 01:03:40.889
<i>The Bride, The Groom</i>

01:03:40.890 --> 01:03:43.099
<i>The Bride, The Groom</i>

01:03:43.100 --> 01:03:45.229
<i>The Bride, The Groom</i>

01:03:45.230 --> 01:03:47.479
<i>The Bride, The Groom</i>

01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:49.860
<i>The Bride, The Groom</i>

01:05:55.980 --> 01:05:58.070
It's over, it's over, it's over...

01:06:01.060 --> 01:06:02.320
It's over.

01:06:06.770 --> 01:06:08.900
I have pain in my temples.

01:06:11.810 --> 01:06:13.360
Whatever you say,

01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:16.990
but you can't be like this,
not tonight.

01:06:27.310 --> 01:06:30.820
A bride from these parts
is made of better things.

01:07:16.140 --> 01:07:19.770
With her today,
try to be affectionate.

01:07:20.350 --> 01:07:22.809
And if she seems haughty to you,

01:07:22.810 --> 01:07:26.110
caress her in a way that provoques
just a little bit of pain,

01:07:27.180 --> 01:07:31.060
a strong embrace, a bite,
and then a soft kiss.

01:07:32.180 --> 01:07:35.929
Don't let her be upset, but let her
know that you're the man,

01:07:35.930 --> 01:07:38.520
the boss, the one who's in charge.

01:07:38.810 --> 01:07:42.710
As your father is not here, I have
to explain these things to you myself.

01:07:47.060 --> 01:07:49.360
I always do what you ask.

01:07:54.230 --> 01:07:56.110
I will go and fetch her.

01:08:00.430 --> 01:08:02.850
Where is my beautiful bride?

01:08:51.890 --> 01:08:53.599
You should be proud,
it has been a beautiful wedding,

01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:55.099
- but I must go.
- Another drink!

01:08:55.100 --> 01:08:57.429
No, no, no, another one, no.

01:08:57.430 --> 01:09:00.310
They've gone...

01:09:03.060 --> 01:09:04.450
On the horse...

01:09:06.060 --> 01:09:08.029
embraced in exhalation.

01:09:12.100 --> 01:09:14.950
Weak, delicate,

01:09:15.060 --> 01:09:17.319
a woman who doesn't sleep well...

01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:20.429
No, not my daughter.

01:09:20.430 --> 01:09:22.100
Your daughter, yes!

01:09:22.180 --> 01:09:24.770
A plant sprouted from an evil mother!

01:09:29.270 --> 01:09:31.819
But she is now my son's wife.

01:09:34.850 --> 01:09:38.450
Who has a horse, right now,
who has a horse?

01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:41.609
Who has a horse!?

01:09:42.390 --> 01:09:44.770
I'll give him whatever I have,

01:09:44.770 --> 01:09:48.279
my eyes and even my tongue...

01:09:55.270 --> 01:09:56.860
Go! After them!

01:10:00.100 --> 01:10:03.320
No. Better don't go.

01:10:03.430 --> 01:10:06.640
These people kill swiftly
and efficiently.

01:10:12.060 --> 01:10:13.490
But yes...

01:10:14.770 --> 01:10:15.950
Run!

01:10:18.350 --> 01:10:20.990
And I am coming up behind you.

01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:36.690
You and you. Go!

01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:46.150
Everybody out of here!

01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:51.740
We are going to help my son.

01:10:53.930 --> 01:10:55.350
Out of here!

01:11:00.350 --> 01:11:02.150
On all roads.

01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:07.320
The hour of blood
has arrived again...

01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:11.030
Two clans...

01:11:33.980 --> 01:11:35.740
You go to your house.

01:11:35.810 --> 01:11:38.110
Brave and alone in your home.

01:11:38.180 --> 01:11:41.520
To get old, to cry.

01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:46.280
But lock the door.

01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:33.700
Be quiet.

01:13:39.060 --> 01:13:41.110
From here, I will go alone.

01:13:41.810 --> 01:13:43.150
Go.

01:13:44.020 --> 01:13:46.700
- I want you to come back.
- I said be quiet!

01:13:46.930 --> 01:13:51.020
With your teeth, with your hands,

01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:54.979
however you can, take from
my honest neck this metal chain,

01:13:54.980 --> 01:13:57.780
leaving me forgotten there
in my earthen house.

01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:02.599
And if you don't want to kill me
as you would a little snake,

01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:05.490
put the barrel of a rifle
in my bridal hands.

01:14:06.430 --> 01:14:08.140
Ay, what lament...

01:14:09.020 --> 01:14:11.490
what a fire that rises up
through my head!

01:14:11.930 --> 01:14:14.139
How many pieces of glass
are stuck in my tongue!

01:14:14.140 --> 01:14:14.979
Be quiet!

01:14:14.980 --> 01:14:18.059
Because they are following us close
behind and I have to take you with me.

01:14:18.060 --> 01:14:21.070
- But it will have to be by force!
- By force?

01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:23.950
Who was the first
to come down the stairs?

01:14:24.060 --> 01:14:25.360
I was.

01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:27.979
Who put the bridles on the horse?

01:14:27.980 --> 01:14:30.450
I did, it's true.

01:14:31.350 --> 01:14:33.559
And whose hands
reached for my spurs?

01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:36.979
These hands,
these hands that are yours,

01:14:36.980 --> 01:14:40.059
but that upon seeing you wish
to break the murmur

01:14:40.060 --> 01:14:42.309
and blue branches of your veins.

01:14:42.310 --> 01:14:43.570
I love you!

01:14:44.180 --> 01:14:45.440
I love you!

01:14:48.140 --> 01:14:50.560
I love you! Leave me!

01:14:51.310 --> 01:14:52.530
Leave me!

01:14:58.980 --> 01:15:01.030
If I could kill you,

01:15:02.850 --> 01:15:06.070
I would cover you
with a shroud lined with violets.

01:15:08.310 --> 01:15:10.150
Ay, what grief!

01:15:10.730 --> 01:15:13.070
What fire runs through my head!

01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:16.070
What glass that cuts
through my tongue!

01:15:16.350 --> 01:15:18.450
Because I wanted to forget,

01:15:19.890 --> 01:15:22.940
so I put a stone wall between
your house and mine.

01:15:23.350 --> 01:15:24.650
It's true.

01:15:25.930 --> 01:15:27.730
Do you remember?

01:15:30.140 --> 01:15:33.019
And when I saw you from afar,
I threw sand in my eyes.

01:15:33.020 --> 01:15:36.200
But I mounted my horse and my horse
went to your door.

01:15:36.350 --> 01:15:39.610
With silver pins my blood turned black,

01:15:40.140 --> 01:15:41.640
and dreams...

01:15:42.810 --> 01:15:45.530
filled my flesh with weeds.

01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:48.360
I am not the one to blame.

01:15:48.390 --> 01:15:50.440
The blame is this land's

01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:57.480
and that perfume that rises
from your breasts and your hair.

01:15:57.890 --> 01:15:59.269
Unjust words!

01:15:59.270 --> 01:16:01.639
I don't want be your bed or food,

01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:04.889
and there isn't a minute in the day
that I don't want to be with you,

01:16:04.890 --> 01:16:09.560
because you drag me away and I go,
and you tell me to return

01:16:09.730 --> 01:16:13.110
and I follow you through the air
like a blade of grass.

01:16:45.770 --> 01:16:47.860
They won't escape.

01:16:57.020 --> 01:16:58.639
Have you seen them pass by?

01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:00.980
Over the hill.

01:17:01.140 --> 01:17:03.020
Can't you hear them?

01:17:24.890 --> 01:17:26.310
Are you sure?

01:17:54.350 --> 01:17:55.889
See this arm?

01:17:55.890 --> 01:17:57.350
It's not mine.

01:17:58.180 --> 01:18:01.560
It's the arm of my brother,
and of my father,

01:18:01.850 --> 01:18:04.200
and of all my dead family.

01:18:04.350 --> 01:18:05.700
Go...

01:18:06.270 --> 01:18:07.530
I'm going...

01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:10.809
I feel the teeth of all my people
wedged in me

01:18:10.810 --> 01:18:14.240
in a way that makes it impossible
for me to breathe calmly.

01:19:38.850 --> 01:19:42.530
I have left a good man
and all of his family...

01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:45.740
in the middle of a wedding
and with my wreath on my head.

01:19:46.020 --> 01:19:49.570
The punishment will be for you
and I don't want it to be that way.

01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:51.030
Leave me alone!

01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:54.860
Flee!

01:19:57.310 --> 01:19:59.360
There is nobody to defend you.

01:20:04.980 --> 01:20:08.200
In the trees the morning birds
are stirring.

01:20:10.310 --> 01:20:14.900
- The night is dying...
- ...on the edge of the stone.

01:20:19.270 --> 01:20:24.990
Let's go to a dark corner,
where I will always love you;

01:20:26.100 --> 01:20:30.570
I don't care about the people
or the poison they throw at us.

01:20:33.060 --> 01:20:35.400
And I will sleep at your feet

01:20:36.810 --> 01:20:39.150
to watch over your dreams.

01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:44.150
Naked, looking at the countryside.

01:20:45.390 --> 01:20:49.270
As if I were a guard dog,
because that's what I am!

01:20:51.310 --> 01:20:53.950
Look at you. Your beauty burns me.

01:20:59.310 --> 01:21:00.979
Where are you taking me?

01:21:00.980 --> 01:21:03.700
Where these men who
chase us cannot go.

01:21:06.180 --> 01:21:08.310
Where I can look at you!

01:21:10.430 --> 01:21:12.640
Take me from fair to fair,

01:21:13.850 --> 01:21:17.889
the pain of an honorable woman,
so people can see me...

01:21:17.890 --> 01:21:20.990
I would also want to leave you
if I thought as others do.

01:21:23.230 --> 01:21:25.280
But I will go wherever you go.

01:21:26.850 --> 01:21:28.110
You too.

01:21:37.770 --> 01:21:39.360
First step forward.

01:21:43.100 --> 01:21:44.150
Try.

01:21:54.890 --> 01:21:59.560
<i>In Vienna there are ten little girls</i>

01:22:00.310 --> 01:22:04.150
<i>a shoulder for death to cry on</i>

01:22:04.810 --> 01:22:09.389
<i>and a forest of dried pigeons</i>

01:22:09.390 --> 01:22:14.020
<i>There is a fragment of tomorrow</i>

01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:19.100
<i>in the museum of winter frost</i>

01:22:19.270 --> 01:22:24.280
<i>There is a thousand-windowed
dance hall</i>

01:22:24.560 --> 01:22:28.700
<i>Ay, ay, ay, ay!</i>

01:22:29.100 --> 01:22:33.950
<i>Take this waltz, take this waltz</i>

01:22:34.480 --> 01:22:40.240
<i>Take this close-mouthed waltz</i>

01:22:45.770 --> 01:22:50.530
<i>In Vienna there are four mirrors</i>

01:22:50.770 --> 01:22:55.729
<i>in which your mouth
and the echoes play</i>

01:22:55.730 --> 01:23:00.429
<i>There is a death for piano</i>

01:23:00.430 --> 01:23:05.230
<i>that paints the little boys blue</i>

01:23:05.310 --> 01:23:09.929
<i>There are beggars on the roof</i>

01:23:09.930 --> 01:23:14.730
<i>There are fresh garlands of tears</i>

01:23:15.180 --> 01:23:19.850
<i>Ay, ay, ay, ay!</i>

01:23:20.140 --> 01:23:25.440
<i>Take this waltz, take this waltz</i>

01:23:26.180 --> 01:23:32.560
<i>Take this waltz that dies in my arms</i>

01:24:16.180 --> 01:24:20.850
<i>Ay, ay, ay, ay!</i>

01:24:21.270 --> 01:24:26.570
<i>Take this waltz, take this waltz</i>

01:24:27.060 --> 01:24:33.570
<i>Take this “I will always
love you” waltz</i>

01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:05.980
<i>My soul in photographs and lilies,</i>

01:25:06.680 --> 01:25:11.020
<i>and in the dark wake
of your footsteps,</i>

01:25:12.310 --> 01:25:16.740
<i>Ay, ay, ay, ay!</i>

01:25:17.390 --> 01:25:23.060
<i>Take this waltz, take this waltz</i>

01:25:24.140 --> 01:25:30.810
<i>Take this waltz that dies in my arms</i>

01:27:41.060 --> 01:27:43.110
She is not to blame!

01:27:44.270 --> 01:27:45.530
Me neither!

01:27:46.770 --> 01:27:48.889
Whose fault is it then?

01:27:48.890 --> 01:27:51.770
Be quiet. Be quiet!

01:27:54.270 --> 01:27:55.610
Here I am.

01:27:56.390 --> 01:27:58.290
Here I am. Take vengeance on me.

01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:00.059
Look how soft my neck is;

01:28:00.060 --> 01:28:03.160
it'll be easier than cutting
a dahlia from your garden...

01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:08.240
What does your death matter to me?
What does anything matter to me?

01:28:11.350 --> 01:28:15.780
Blessed be the wheat, because
the bodies of my sons lie below it;

01:28:15.930 --> 01:28:19.560
blessed be the rain, because
it dampens the face of the dead...

01:28:20.350 --> 01:28:24.150
Blessed be the wheat, because
the bodies of my sons lie below it;

01:28:24.600 --> 01:28:28.070
blessed be the rain, because
it dampens the face of the dead...

01:28:28.230 --> 01:28:31.519
Blessed be the wheat, because
the bodies of my sons lie below it;

01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:33.929
- blessed be the rain, because...
- Have mercy on yourself.

01:28:33.930 --> 01:28:35.350
Quiet!

01:28:38.730 --> 01:28:40.320
I don't want tears.

01:28:43.980 --> 01:28:47.650
Your tears only come from your eyes.

01:28:50.390 --> 01:28:52.850
Mine come when I am alone.

01:28:53.350 --> 01:28:57.860
The spurt from the soles of my feet,
from my very roots.

01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:17.530
My son should be answering me.

01:29:20.390 --> 01:29:25.850
But my son is now
an armful of dried flowers.

01:29:41.680 --> 01:29:46.190
Come to my house,
don't stay here alone.

01:29:46.980 --> 01:29:49.320
These will be horrible days.

01:29:49.680 --> 01:29:51.690
I don't want to see anybody.

01:29:53.980 --> 01:29:55.490
The land and me.

01:29:57.060 --> 01:29:58.820
My lament and me.

01:30:00.180 --> 01:30:02.020
One must be calm.

01:30:05.980 --> 01:30:07.700
I am so poor.

01:30:08.140 --> 01:30:09.600
So poor!

01:30:09.980 --> 01:30:13.820
A woman who has no son
upon which to place her lips.

01:30:14.480 --> 01:30:16.450
Let me weep with you.

01:30:21.560 --> 01:30:22.740
Weep...

01:30:24.180 --> 01:30:25.850
but at the door.

01:31:38.600 --> 01:31:42.240
And I will follow you through the air,
like a blade of grass...

01:31:43.305 --> 01:31:49.495
