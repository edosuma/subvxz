WEBVTT

01:33.719 --> 01:36.137
Here, little piggy!

01:36.472 --> 01:38.389
Come on! Get back here!

01:39.433 --> 01:40.475
Get up, you little...

01:40.559 --> 01:44.061
Hey, John! Gonna bring me some bacon?

01:45.898 --> 01:49.317
What's the matter, John?
You break your ankle?

01:49.651 --> 01:52.403
Snatch it!
Pretend it's a little girl.

01:52.488 --> 01:54.197
Ooh...

01:55.491 --> 01:56.866
Big guns!

02:04.416 --> 02:06.876
Well, isn't this a shit-ton of stupid?

02:07.211 --> 02:09.629
Go on, now, party's over.

02:39.159 --> 02:40.493
Shit.

02:45.207 --> 02:47.083
Don't tell Mama.

02:51.296 --> 02:54.632
She loves her roses so much.

02:55.759 --> 02:57.844
Get in, come on.

02:59.596 --> 03:04.350
- What are we drinkin'?
- No. We are definitely not drinkin'.

03:09.731 --> 03:12.149
Boring.

03:17.030 --> 03:19.448
There is never anything to do here.

03:19.533 --> 03:20.992
No?

03:21.577 --> 03:23.244
So what were you up to?

03:24.955 --> 03:27.415
Hangin' with my friends.

03:28.667 --> 03:31.168
They love me.

03:33.130 --> 03:35.590
They do, you know,

03:35.799 --> 03:37.133
love me.

03:38.427 --> 03:40.469
They'd do anything for me.

03:40.888 --> 03:43.639
I just ask, and...

03:44.641 --> 03:46.392
They're my besties.

03:46.476 --> 03:47.935
Here, take this.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.324
Why are you being sweet to me?

04:02.367 --> 04:03.826
Why shouldn't I be?

04:05.287 --> 04:06.954
'Cause I'm not nice.

04:08.248 --> 04:10.750
I wasn't nice either
when I was your age.

04:11.376 --> 04:13.419
Well, I'm nearly a woman.

04:13.503 --> 04:15.504
That's what Adora says.

04:18.050 --> 04:20.259
Adora doesn't know about you.

04:21.511 --> 04:22.929
But I do.

04:23.680 --> 04:25.181
I can tell.

04:26.475 --> 04:28.935
You hate this place like me,

04:30.354 --> 04:36.108
but you love dead girls.

04:37.361 --> 04:39.278
Couldn't stay away.

04:40.405 --> 04:42.281
I'm here for the paper, that's all.

04:42.366 --> 04:43.699
You weren't curious?

04:43.784 --> 04:46.202
-About Wind Gap?
-About me.

04:47.955 --> 04:49.413
Drink this.

04:53.502 --> 04:55.294
Do you have a boyfriend?

04:55.837 --> 04:57.213
Nope.

04:57.547 --> 04:59.006
Don't you want one?

04:59.091 --> 05:01.008
Sometimes. Depends.

05:02.636 --> 05:04.178
Kids?

05:04.846 --> 05:07.598
Don't you want a little baby?

05:07.808 --> 05:10.101
Babies are so cute.

05:13.313 --> 05:16.107
Well, I wouldn't know
the first thing to do with a baby.

05:16.858 --> 05:19.068
You take care of them.

05:19.987 --> 05:22.196
You can practice on me, if you want.

05:22.572 --> 05:25.950
You seem to be doing a pretty
good job taking care of yourself.

05:26.451 --> 05:28.744
I've never had a sister.

05:33.041 --> 05:35.167
I just wanna know you.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.921
Sister.

05:39.965 --> 05:43.718
My long-lost sister.

06:22.466 --> 06:23.966
We checkin' in?

06:24.384 --> 06:25.760
We are.

06:28.764 --> 06:30.181
Let me see.

06:30.640 --> 06:31.932
Come on.

06:36.605 --> 06:38.022
Press hard.

06:41.068 --> 06:44.278
Sign 'em on the third page
and we'll get that patched up.

06:44.362 --> 06:45.946
You have insurance?

06:46.031 --> 06:47.364
Yeah.

07:07.344 --> 07:08.594
Alice.

07:08.678 --> 07:10.137
Time's up.

07:12.057 --> 07:13.682
I have an intake.

07:14.351 --> 07:15.726
Well, find somebody.

07:15.811 --> 07:17.895
-Come on, five more minutes.
-No, I can't. Go on.

07:19.898 --> 07:22.566
Am I the only one workin'
in this goddamn place?

07:23.443 --> 07:24.819
Yes!

07:24.986 --> 07:26.237
Go.

07:26.696 --> 07:28.364
Yes, let me talk to him.

07:36.915 --> 07:38.082
You're kidding me.

07:38.166 --> 07:40.334
Alice, Camille. Camille, Alice.

07:40.418 --> 07:41.836
Good night, girls.

07:47.425 --> 07:49.051
Don't talk to me.

08:10.407 --> 08:11.699
Hello.

08:11.783 --> 08:13.367
Did I wake you up?

08:13.535 --> 08:16.412
No, I just got back from spin class.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.414
Your piece wasn't bad.

08:18.498 --> 08:21.000
It'll be on the website later,
paper tomorrow.

08:21.293 --> 08:23.419
Good. When can I come home?

08:23.837 --> 08:25.129
You know what I want.

08:25.213 --> 08:27.298
Are parents taking precautions?

08:27.382 --> 08:29.258
Are people letting kids
out of their sight?

08:29.342 --> 08:31.385
And don't be afraid
to get a little personal.

08:31.469 --> 08:33.679
Like, how does it feel to be home?

08:33.847 --> 08:35.264
Easy.

08:35.849 --> 08:37.683
Every day is a gift.

08:56.786 --> 08:59.580
Last night I threw up three times.

08:59.956 --> 09:03.000
- I don't like it.
- It's just chills, dear.

09:03.084 --> 09:06.128
Give Dr. Manning a call.
Just in case.

09:18.350 --> 09:20.267
I love you, love you, I love you.

09:23.813 --> 09:25.522
Where's Camille, Mama?

09:27.317 --> 09:28.567
Have a nice day.

09:32.948 --> 09:34.573
Whaddya know, Joe?

09:38.328 --> 09:41.247
A mysterious trucker who
murdered two girls ten months apart.

09:41.331 --> 09:44.166
Half the workers over there
are fuckin' Mexicans.

09:44.417 --> 09:47.461
Whole villages move up from...
Wherever.

09:47.545 --> 09:50.172
Bring their families, their habits.
Who knows what else.

09:50.674 --> 09:51.882
Fuckin' bullshit.

09:51.967 --> 09:53.634
So you're looking at
a trucker or a Mexican

09:53.718 --> 09:56.512
or anyone that doesn't actually live
in or about the town of Wind Gap.

09:56.596 --> 09:59.014
- You don't know the people...
- I know this is a crime of passion.

09:59.099 --> 10:00.140
Nobody touched those girls.

10:00.225 --> 10:01.850
Passion doesn't always
have to equal sex.

10:01.935 --> 10:04.353
This type of thing can scratch
a different kind of itch.

10:04.437 --> 10:05.813
Power. Control.

10:06.356 --> 10:08.315
Now you're just makin' shit up.

10:08.400 --> 10:10.776
I was asked down here
because this is what I do.

10:10.860 --> 10:12.444
I went through your incident reports,

10:12.529 --> 10:14.655
and most Saturday nights
you got a few rowdy teens

10:14.739 --> 10:16.532
and the same drunk
stealing the same car

10:16.616 --> 10:18.993
and leaving it in the same cow pasture
as last Saturday night.

10:19.077 --> 10:20.619
His name is Earl.

10:21.079 --> 10:22.871
And it was his car
before he lost it in a bet.

10:22.956 --> 10:23.998
Right, you know these people.

10:24.082 --> 10:26.625
And nine out of 10 murder victims,
they knew their killer.

10:26.835 --> 10:28.002
The teeth, the strangling...

10:28.086 --> 10:31.088
Someone had a particular problem
with those particular girls.

10:31.172 --> 10:32.339
Anyone fit that profile?

10:32.424 --> 10:34.675
Any specific fuckin' Mexican, Bill?

10:36.094 --> 10:37.928
That'd be great for you, wouldn't it?

10:38.263 --> 10:40.556
-Killer with a grudge.
-What does that mean?

10:40.640 --> 10:43.267
A serial? I betcha
that pops a career into high gear

10:43.351 --> 10:44.518
quicker than shit through a goose.

10:44.602 --> 10:45.894
I gotta think of the bottom line.

10:45.979 --> 10:48.439
All the small town
sit-on-your-ass jobs are taken.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.192
You best remember...

10:54.321 --> 10:56.071
My town, my case.

10:56.156 --> 10:57.197
My ass.

11:15.550 --> 11:17.217
It was someone they knew.

11:17.510 --> 11:18.969
Or it wasn't.

11:33.818 --> 11:35.069
Hi.

11:36.404 --> 11:38.364
She wouldn't talk to you?

11:40.909 --> 11:43.786
Well, she had a few choice words
for me.

11:44.454 --> 11:45.871
She's not doing so well.

11:45.955 --> 11:47.081
Self-medicating.

11:47.290 --> 11:49.124
We learned about that in health class.

11:49.209 --> 11:51.460
You learn about that
just by living here.

11:51.920 --> 11:53.212
Well, I'm Ashley.

11:53.380 --> 11:54.713
Wheeler. John's girlfriend.

11:54.798 --> 11:56.632
-Camille Preaker.
-I know.

11:56.800 --> 11:58.175
I know all about you.

11:59.094 --> 12:02.054
My baby sister Jodes,
she's friends with Amma.

12:02.138 --> 12:03.263
And my older sister Danielle,

12:03.348 --> 12:05.516
she was a freshman
when you were a senior.

12:05.600 --> 12:07.893
She said you were it back in the day.

12:07.977 --> 12:09.478
Yeah, well, that was a long time ago.

12:09.562 --> 12:12.773
No! Dani's married now. Three kids.

12:13.066 --> 12:14.191
She got fat.

12:14.275 --> 12:16.318
Well, tell her I said hello.

12:16.403 --> 12:17.861
And to diet and exercise.

12:17.987 --> 12:19.405
I will.

12:20.031 --> 12:22.116
You wanna talk to John, right?

12:23.701 --> 12:25.119
'Cause I can make that happen.

12:25.203 --> 12:26.578
He listens to me.

12:26.830 --> 12:29.498
Yeah. Yeah, I'd appreciate that. Yeah.

12:29.624 --> 12:31.500
It'd be good for him
to talk to someone.

12:32.001 --> 12:34.336
Everyone thinks he's guilty
just 'cause he's sensitive.

12:34.421 --> 12:35.754
I hate that.

12:35.839 --> 12:37.423
I'll bet you're sensitive.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.341
Writers are sensitive.

12:39.676 --> 12:41.552
You could help everyone understand.

12:44.055 --> 12:46.306
-Should I just wait here?
-No. Not now.

12:46.391 --> 12:48.350
He's always agitated
after he talks to his mother.

12:48.435 --> 12:49.726
He's not even staying here anymore.

12:49.811 --> 12:52.563
He's been staying with me
ever since Natalie went missin'.

12:53.231 --> 12:56.358
Just come by my house later.
1834 Tillman.

12:56.443 --> 12:58.068
I'll have John ready for you.

13:11.207 --> 13:12.291
Fake piece of shit!

13:14.169 --> 13:15.294
Fuck.

13:15.879 --> 13:17.504
Are you trying to eat it?

13:17.589 --> 13:18.797
What...

13:20.550 --> 13:21.884
I'm not that good.

13:22.093 --> 13:23.635
Well, yeah.

13:24.637 --> 13:27.055
Okay. There you go.

13:33.438 --> 13:36.648
My mama always says
a lipstick makes you look like a lady,

13:36.733 --> 13:38.108
so there you go.

13:38.359 --> 13:39.735
Rub 'em together.

13:40.278 --> 13:42.112
Now you look like a lady.

13:43.615 --> 13:45.157
Thanks.

13:46.201 --> 13:48.285
You're lucky
you can still wear skirts.

13:49.913 --> 13:51.288
It's a pain.

13:51.456 --> 13:53.999
Making sure
they cover enough territory.

13:54.250 --> 13:56.251
But I made a promise to myself.

13:57.170 --> 14:00.255
Three inches above the knee.

14:01.382 --> 14:04.343
Otherwise, well, you know.

14:06.221 --> 14:08.597
I haven't worn a skirt since college.

14:09.557 --> 14:10.974
How old are you?

14:11.184 --> 14:12.601
Older than you.

14:14.145 --> 14:15.938
I always thought
it was something you grow out of.

14:16.022 --> 14:18.649
I've just never been very good
at the adult thing, I guess.

14:20.235 --> 14:21.944
Peter Pan of cutting.

14:22.946 --> 14:25.239
Yeah. I won't grow up, not me.

14:28.243 --> 14:31.703
My mom hates
everything I wear anyway, so...

14:32.580 --> 14:34.831
What about you? Any visitors today?

14:35.625 --> 14:38.585
My mom said she's comin', so...

14:39.963 --> 14:41.463
She like your clothes?

14:42.257 --> 14:43.298
No.

14:44.259 --> 14:45.300
God, no.

14:46.636 --> 14:48.387
What kind of stuff do you listen to?

14:49.222 --> 14:51.098
That's not really my thing, music.

14:52.016 --> 14:53.809
Well, no wonder you're here, girl.

14:55.436 --> 14:58.939
You're here too, girl. FYI.

14:59.107 --> 15:00.899
Yeah, but...

15:11.077 --> 15:13.870
Want these? I can get the hell
out of here whenever I want.

16:24.233 --> 16:25.400
Hi.

16:25.610 --> 16:27.903
You lookin' at him? John Keene?

16:28.821 --> 16:31.031
I got my eyes on everyone.

16:31.866 --> 16:34.576
You talkin' about the case,
or you just talkin' about me?

16:36.079 --> 16:37.496
What, you're not gonna share anything?

16:37.580 --> 16:39.831
-Not with you.
-Come on.

16:40.291 --> 16:43.168
Theories? Suspects?
You can either help me get it right,

16:43.252 --> 16:44.378
or I can...

16:44.462 --> 16:46.630
Or what? You go to Vickery,
give him that big-eyed flirt

16:46.714 --> 16:48.340
you throwin' my way?

16:48.800 --> 16:50.550
What can I say? I love my job.

16:50.635 --> 16:52.511
Well, good luck with that.

16:52.595 --> 16:56.056
He's a hamster on a wheel
chasin' imaginary truckers.

16:56.224 --> 16:57.599
Mexican hog workers.

16:57.684 --> 16:59.309
You don't think he's right?

17:01.437 --> 17:02.896
No comment.

17:04.649 --> 17:07.109
Come on. The teeth, the bodies...

17:07.193 --> 17:09.152
It sure doesn't feel random, does it?

17:09.237 --> 17:11.905
And that dirt that you pulled off
of Bob Nash's tires...

17:11.989 --> 17:13.490
You trying to tell me
he's not a suspect?

17:13.574 --> 17:16.326
-I'm not trying to tell you anything.
-Okay, give me some insight.

17:16.411 --> 17:18.078
I read your sob story.

17:20.123 --> 17:22.082
Wait till the rest of this place
gets a hold of it.

17:22.166 --> 17:23.458
They'll all be juicin' up
their stories,

17:23.543 --> 17:25.419
angling for their 15 minutes.

17:25.503 --> 17:27.462
And that bullshit from Natalie's room?

17:28.798 --> 17:31.091
There's no way
her mom let you in there.

17:34.846 --> 17:37.222
The best thing for both of us...

17:39.934 --> 17:41.518
Stay out of my way.

18:10.131 --> 18:13.508
You know, if I were paranoid, Chief,
I'd think you were checkin' up on me.

18:14.385 --> 18:16.470
I'm not the one writin' stories
about our town.

18:16.554 --> 18:19.306
You think about it,
it's you checkin' up on us.

18:20.183 --> 18:23.810
You really think that Ann and Natalie
were murdered by some random trucker?

18:25.772 --> 18:29.191
That boy from Kansas City
talks like a woman from Wind Gap.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.819
Doesn't help anything,

18:33.404 --> 18:35.864
you talkin' to people,
riling folks up.

18:37.116 --> 18:39.451
You got two mutilated girls
on your hands.

18:40.244 --> 18:42.579
Someone else is doing the riling.

19:05.394 --> 19:07.395
Yeah, Ann was a talker,

19:07.730 --> 19:10.440
bossy sometimes, but she's smart.

19:11.025 --> 19:13.276
Different smart from other kids.

19:14.195 --> 19:17.030
She'd ask me things
that were grown-up, you know?

19:17.114 --> 19:19.991
Stuff she thought was dumb,
stuff she thought was funny.

19:20.076 --> 19:22.077
Can't do that with my other kids.

19:22.745 --> 19:24.871
Hell, I can't even do that
with my wife.

19:25.414 --> 19:27.499
She had never wanted kids.
That was all me.

19:27.583 --> 19:30.293
Figured it would be different
once she loves 'em.

19:34.340 --> 19:36.299
What kind of person does that?

19:37.093 --> 19:38.552
Hurt a child.

19:39.011 --> 19:41.263
Somebody with no feeling inside,
is that it?

19:41.556 --> 19:43.306
Are you talking about your wife,
or are you talking...

19:43.391 --> 19:45.058
Talkin' about Ann.
The person who did that to Ann.

19:45.142 --> 19:47.769
And the police, they haven't found
a goddamn thing.

19:47.854 --> 19:49.938
You don't think
they're doing a good job?

19:50.022 --> 19:53.275
They're talkin' to me.
Like I'm the one.

19:53.985 --> 19:57.112
Do you think that has anything
to do with your DUIs?

19:57.280 --> 19:58.989
Or the assault?

19:59.448 --> 20:00.866
I did some checkin'.

20:01.033 --> 20:03.118
What, you never had a few too many?

20:03.703 --> 20:05.537
I got into a fight once...

20:06.080 --> 20:08.206
So that means I killed my daughter?

20:08.291 --> 20:10.333
-No, I'm not implying that.
-Yeah, but they are!

20:10.418 --> 20:12.168
That guy from Kansas City?

20:12.253 --> 20:14.754
He's been all over me
and all over my family?

20:15.339 --> 20:16.840
You know what?

20:19.802 --> 20:22.429
Do you still think
that it's a man that killed Ann?

20:22.513 --> 20:26.391
'Cause there's a little boy who said
that he saw a woman grab Natalie.

20:26.475 --> 20:27.809
What, the Capisi kid?

20:28.144 --> 20:29.519
-Yeah.
-No.

20:29.979 --> 20:31.479
It was a man. I...

20:31.772 --> 20:34.524
I'd put money on it.
The women around here,

20:34.609 --> 20:37.319
they don't kill with their hands.
They talk, and you're dead.

20:37.403 --> 20:38.653
That's true enough.

20:38.738 --> 20:41.990
If I was pretty and that Keene boy
lived on this side of town,

20:42.074 --> 20:43.325
it'd be a whole different story.

20:43.409 --> 20:45.076
He's got no alibi.

20:45.620 --> 20:47.370
John Keene has no motive.

20:47.455 --> 20:49.080
What, and I do?

20:49.498 --> 20:50.832
That kid, he's all quiet,

20:50.917 --> 20:53.209
he keeps to himself
like he's got something to hide?

20:53.294 --> 20:56.212
You know? Maybe urges,
things he can't control?

20:56.380 --> 20:58.089
I seen him sometimes
out by the plant...

20:58.174 --> 20:59.507
What?

20:59.592 --> 21:02.260
Ms. Crellin's here.

21:02.345 --> 21:04.137
I am so sorry, Bob.

21:04.221 --> 21:07.182
I had no idea she would come here
and pressure you.

21:07.266 --> 21:08.642
-No.
-No, we're just in the middle of...

21:08.726 --> 21:10.894
How dare you interrogate him?

21:10.978 --> 21:14.272
You are not the police, Camille.
You are not to harass good people.

21:14.774 --> 21:18.526
Your mama, she tutored Ann.

21:18.819 --> 21:20.195
- Ann was so fond of her.
- Camille.

21:20.279 --> 21:22.489
I think you should leave.
I'm here on a social visit.

21:22.573 --> 21:24.032
Your presence here is inappropriate.

21:24.116 --> 21:26.076
-We weren't done talkin'...
-Yes.

21:26.494 --> 21:27.744
You are.

21:41.133 --> 21:42.509
Damn it!

22:36.689 --> 22:37.731
Hey, Charlie.

24:59.415 --> 25:00.790
Thank you.

25:00.916 --> 25:02.250
I appreciate what you did,

25:02.334 --> 25:05.879
and I apologize
for my daughter's behavior.

25:06.172 --> 25:07.505
Which one?

25:08.507 --> 25:10.133
What are you talkin' about?

25:10.384 --> 25:13.803
I caught Amma out after curfew
with her friends.

25:13.888 --> 25:14.929
Amma!

25:15.014 --> 25:16.723
Come on now, there's no need for that.

25:16.807 --> 25:18.141
Gayla?

25:18.434 --> 25:19.767
Gayla.

25:19.852 --> 25:22.103
-Yes, miss?
-Would you fetch Amma for me, please?

25:22.188 --> 25:24.314
And get the Chief his usual.

25:24.398 --> 25:27.233
The usual with coffee, or ice?

25:27.359 --> 25:28.526
Thank you, darlin'.

25:32.031 --> 25:33.823
How did you know Camille was at Bob's?

25:33.908 --> 25:35.450
You're not having him watched,
are you?

25:35.534 --> 25:37.160
We got eyes on him.

25:37.411 --> 25:38.453
He's not the only one.

25:38.537 --> 25:41.414
I refuse to believe
he'd kill his own child.

25:41.498 --> 25:44.709
-Who would do such a thing?
-We're investigating all leads, Adora.

25:45.044 --> 25:47.128
Well, I do hope
you're getting somewhere.

25:47.213 --> 25:49.756
-The detective...
-He's convinced it's one of ours.

25:49.840 --> 25:51.549
But you're not, are you?

25:52.760 --> 25:54.219
I'm not sure.

25:54.345 --> 25:56.971
Might have to start wrapping my head
around the idea.

25:57.056 --> 26:00.266
But you're broadening the search.
What about the slaughterhouse?

26:00.351 --> 26:02.352
That's a little obvious,
don't you think?

26:03.312 --> 26:04.896
Those girls,

26:05.356 --> 26:07.565
I was a part of their lives.

26:07.983 --> 26:10.693
And with Marian, it feels personal.

26:10.778 --> 26:12.237
Hey, we'll get there. It's all right.

26:12.321 --> 26:14.364
We'll get there, we'll get there.

26:14.490 --> 26:16.574
We're checkin' everybody
you got workin' for you,

26:16.659 --> 26:18.493
all the people you let go.

26:18.953 --> 26:20.995
You wanted to see me, Mama?

26:21.413 --> 26:24.290
Chief Vickery told me
something I find alarming.

26:24.375 --> 26:26.918
- Come here.
- I've gotta get back to work.

26:27.002 --> 26:29.212
I'll have this coffee another time.

26:30.172 --> 26:32.298
What are you wearing?

26:33.634 --> 26:37.553
I was just playing
dress-ups with Kelsey and...

26:37.638 --> 26:40.682
You are not to be outside
this house after curfew.

26:40.766 --> 26:42.225
-Never.
-I was safe.

26:42.309 --> 26:45.645
-That is not for you to decide.
-Well, you let Camille do it!

26:46.272 --> 26:47.355
Excuse me?

26:47.439 --> 26:50.066
You think bad things didn't happen
to little girls when she was my age?

26:50.150 --> 26:51.609
I know they did.
And you let Camille...

26:51.694 --> 26:53.069
And look what happened to her.

26:53.153 --> 26:54.279
You need to understand

26:54.363 --> 26:56.781
your sister does not see herself
in a good light.

26:56.865 --> 26:58.408
It's caused her difficulty.

26:58.492 --> 27:01.160
You need to be careful with Camille.

27:01.245 --> 27:03.496
-She's not someone to be admired.
-What difficulty? What difficulty?

27:03.580 --> 27:06.332
No. Look at me. Look at me.

27:07.251 --> 27:10.420
You are not safe around her.

27:10.629 --> 27:12.463
Do you understand me?

27:15.259 --> 27:17.343
Do you understand?

27:24.518 --> 27:25.852
Come in.

27:29.732 --> 27:32.275
We're in the carriage house,
in the back. Follow me.

27:45.914 --> 27:47.498
Come on in.

27:51.128 --> 27:53.212
So, you've been staying with Ashley?

27:53.630 --> 27:54.672
Yeah.

27:55.007 --> 27:56.883
Yeah, her parents have been very kind.

27:57.134 --> 27:59.218
How does your mother feel about it?

27:59.636 --> 28:01.012
She understands.

28:01.889 --> 28:03.097
It's...

28:03.974 --> 28:06.351
It's just not comfortable for me there
right now.

28:14.193 --> 28:15.651
-Thanks.
-I thought...

28:15.736 --> 28:17.904
- I thought school was out.
- It is.

28:18.197 --> 28:20.656
Sometimes I just get
to feelin' spirited.

28:23.577 --> 28:26.746
-Can I get you one of those?
-No. No.

28:28.957 --> 28:31.250
Okay, John, do you mind?

28:31.794 --> 28:33.336
No, we don't mind.

28:35.923 --> 28:39.592
So what I would like
to be able to do is just really

28:41.136 --> 28:43.471
describe Natalie to our readers.

28:43.555 --> 28:45.306
She was such a tomboy.

28:45.391 --> 28:47.934
Always climbin' trees,

28:48.310 --> 28:49.936
and skinnin' her knee.

28:51.146 --> 28:55.108
Well, Bob Nash has been talkin'
to me about Ann and Natalie.

28:55.859 --> 28:57.318
Why is Bob Nash talking about Natalie?

28:57.403 --> 29:00.029
Well, it's not just Mr. Nash.
Other people are saying

29:00.114 --> 29:02.031
that you two had a very

29:03.325 --> 29:05.118
close relationship.

29:05.953 --> 29:08.788
-And what's that supposed to mean?
-Bob Nash is a drunk.

29:08.872 --> 29:10.915
He doesn't even pretend to hide it.

29:10.999 --> 29:13.543
Did you guys spend
a lot of time together?

29:13.794 --> 29:16.212
Yeah, of course, she was my sister.
What did Bob Nash say about me?

29:16.296 --> 29:18.965
Well, I'm more interested
to know what you have to say.

29:20.467 --> 29:23.344
I bet he told you all about
his perfect little Ann, right?

29:24.596 --> 29:26.097
Sometimes I think
if Natalie never met her...

29:26.181 --> 29:29.392
That little girl is dead, too.

29:30.060 --> 29:32.270
He has a lot of sorrow
in his heart for her.

29:37.443 --> 29:39.944
-Did the police speak with you?
-About what?

29:40.320 --> 29:41.821
Your alibi.

29:42.406 --> 29:45.867
Where you were the night
that Natalie went missin'.

29:47.661 --> 29:49.412
I was out drivin' around.

29:51.123 --> 29:52.498
I'm not sure that a grand jury

29:52.583 --> 29:54.625
will appreciate
the romance of an open highway.

29:54.710 --> 29:56.210
I told you.

29:56.295 --> 29:57.795
Yeah, Ashley doesn't
appreciate it, either.

29:57.880 --> 29:59.172
I do.

30:01.258 --> 30:03.968
It's just a...
It's a smaller town than I'm used to.

30:04.303 --> 30:06.137
John is just being noble.

30:07.848 --> 30:09.807
He was with me that night.

30:10.058 --> 30:11.434
Ashley, no.

30:11.518 --> 30:13.060
-No, listen... Look...
-No.

30:13.645 --> 30:16.481
I'm not gonna have people thinkin'
my boyfriend is a fuckin' baby killer,

30:16.565 --> 30:18.065
thank you very much.

30:19.151 --> 30:20.443
Hey.

30:22.404 --> 30:24.363
How long have you lived here, John?

30:25.240 --> 30:26.824
A little over two years.

30:27.117 --> 30:28.534
Since I was a sophomore.

30:28.619 --> 30:29.827
You like it here?

30:32.039 --> 30:33.331
I miss...

30:35.042 --> 30:37.502
I miss that, in the city, you can...

30:38.712 --> 30:42.840
You can walk outside your front door
and there's people all around you.

30:44.760 --> 30:46.594
And they don't know a thing about you.

30:48.180 --> 30:49.764
You could be anyone.

30:50.307 --> 30:51.849
Natalie never cared
what people thought.

30:51.934 --> 30:53.976
Like this one time,
she made up her own language

30:54.061 --> 30:56.020
with the alphabet and everything.

30:59.441 --> 31:02.401
She was so excited she refused
to speak English for a week.

31:05.489 --> 31:06.948
I shoulda learned it.

31:09.326 --> 31:10.701
I hate it here.

31:11.912 --> 31:13.871
If we'd never come here,
Natalie'd still be alive.

31:13.956 --> 31:15.540
No, you don't mean that.

31:15.874 --> 31:17.792
If you'd never come,
we wouldn't be together.

31:17.876 --> 31:19.794
No, it's this town.

31:21.004 --> 31:23.923
It's this town. And someone
here killed my little sister.

31:28.428 --> 31:30.304
I'm just gonna go get him.

31:30.389 --> 31:32.932
-We can finish this another time.
-One sec.

31:34.851 --> 31:36.269
John.

32:20.188 --> 32:21.564
Mama?

32:23.108 --> 32:24.900
I suppose you spent your day

32:24.985 --> 32:28.029
chatting it up to anyone
who would talk to you.

32:28.363 --> 32:29.780
"Work."

32:31.158 --> 32:32.617
I'm sorry.

32:33.285 --> 32:35.870
I didn't understand
how well you knew him.

32:36.997 --> 32:39.040
I told you I did.

32:39.124 --> 32:42.043
How dare you question me
in my own home?

32:42.127 --> 32:44.086
How dare you take advantage of Bob?

32:44.171 --> 32:45.880
Did you see him when you left?

32:46.340 --> 32:49.091
That man was practically quivering.

32:49.176 --> 32:51.761
He lost his daughter.

32:51.928 --> 32:54.263
You have no idea what that's like.

32:54.348 --> 32:57.683
-Well, I didn't mean to...
-You never mean to do anything.

32:58.226 --> 33:00.728
And yet you cause so much hurt.

33:01.229 --> 33:02.480
Bob,

33:02.981 --> 33:04.315
Amma...

33:05.067 --> 33:07.026
-Amma?
-She's a little girl, Camille.

33:07.110 --> 33:08.527
She doesn't...

33:08.612 --> 33:10.696
She doesn't understand what you are.

33:15.535 --> 33:17.161
Look what you've done.

33:18.038 --> 33:20.873
I didn't crash the cart
into the rose bushes, Mama.

33:22.459 --> 33:26.420
Nothing's ever your fault, is it?

33:57.661 --> 33:58.994
Camille?

34:04.167 --> 34:06.961
Does it get better with your family?

34:08.255 --> 34:10.464
Maybe when I'm older, like you?

34:12.718 --> 34:14.176
No.

34:15.512 --> 34:17.012
Not really.

34:20.016 --> 34:21.892
So what do you do?

34:26.314 --> 34:28.065
You survive.

35:05.645 --> 35:07.146
Thank you.

35:14.654 --> 35:16.030
Hey.

35:18.033 --> 35:19.533
Let's get out of here.

35:48.188 --> 35:51.524
Do you think Amma's safe
with Camille in the house?

35:53.109 --> 35:54.693
Why wouldn't she be?

35:56.112 --> 35:58.948
Coming and going at all hours,
the drinking.

35:59.825 --> 36:01.784
She sets a bad example.

36:01.993 --> 36:04.537
Well, Camille is a grown woman.

36:05.747 --> 36:07.873
Her choices don't reflect on us.

36:09.376 --> 36:12.336
She makes me feel
as if I've done something wrong.

36:12.712 --> 36:14.880
As if I'm a bad mother.

36:15.882 --> 36:20.886
You do everything you can
for your children.

36:24.307 --> 36:25.933
You're good to me, Alan.

36:27.394 --> 36:29.895
Then perhaps I should
stay with you tonight.

36:30.480 --> 36:31.689
Just in case.

36:34.317 --> 36:36.527
I'm sure that won't be necessary.

36:45.161 --> 36:46.662
Good night.

37:00.468 --> 37:01.802
Hey.

37:04.764 --> 37:08.350
Jodes told me you were over
at her place talkin' to John Keene.

37:08.518 --> 37:09.894
Yeah.

37:11.354 --> 37:12.855
Did he confess?

37:14.190 --> 37:16.734
-Do you think he did it?
-I don't know.

37:17.611 --> 37:19.111
You do.

37:19.571 --> 37:21.322
-You think he did it.
-Amma.

37:22.699 --> 37:24.325
He's probably innocent.

37:25.160 --> 37:27.202
I mean, he cries a lot,

37:28.121 --> 37:29.496
but he's okay.

37:29.664 --> 37:32.416
Ashley is such a bitch.
I don't know what he sees in her.

37:32.500 --> 37:34.084
Well, she's very pretty.

37:34.169 --> 37:37.296
At parties and stuff he's always
lookin' over his shoulder at me.

37:37.964 --> 37:40.007
It's me he likes. I can tell.

37:40.508 --> 37:42.885
He's a little old for you,
don't you think?

37:43.136 --> 37:44.428
No.

37:45.513 --> 37:47.473
I'm "almost a woman," remember?

37:49.225 --> 37:52.269
All the same, you should give him
some space. He's going through a lot.

37:52.562 --> 37:54.188
Whatever.

37:54.397 --> 37:56.857
He's not my type. Too pretty.

37:59.444 --> 38:02.613
-I'm goin' out. Wanna come?
-No, you are not.

38:03.573 --> 38:06.283
Amma, you're the same age
as Natalie and Ann.

38:07.577 --> 38:09.828
Would you have gone, if you were me?

38:11.581 --> 38:12.873
Yes.

38:13.500 --> 38:15.542
But I was stupid, and you're not.

38:15.627 --> 38:17.670
I'll be sure I'm safe.

38:18.755 --> 38:21.256
Like, you comin' with me...

38:21.633 --> 38:23.008
Come on, we'll party.

38:23.551 --> 38:25.844
-You and me.
-No, I need to stay home.

38:25.929 --> 38:27.638
When I finish my work,
I'm gonna go to sleep.

38:27.722 --> 38:30.557
Just like you need to stay home
and go to sleep.

38:30.642 --> 38:32.685
-'Cause I want you to be safe.
-Whatever.

38:33.228 --> 38:34.478
Amma...

38:35.814 --> 38:37.314
You promise me?

38:39.150 --> 38:41.485
Fine. I promise.

38:46.741 --> 38:49.118
Mama says I need
to be careful around you.

38:50.745 --> 38:53.080
Is that true? Are you dangerous?

38:54.082 --> 38:56.000
Thought you were the wild one.

38:56.209 --> 38:59.253
I hung out in parking lots
and I talked to boys.

38:59.963 --> 39:01.463
Wild was different back then.

39:05.719 --> 39:07.511
Sleep well, sister.

40:33.640 --> 40:35.516
- Give me two more of those.
- Yeah.

40:35.725 --> 40:37.392
It's a peace offering.

40:40.980 --> 40:42.564
I spoke with John Keene.

40:42.649 --> 40:44.691
He says he feels
like he has a bull's-eye on his back.

40:44.776 --> 40:46.360
What do you think?

40:47.362 --> 40:50.656
Little sensitive.
Cries at the drop of a hat. Unlikely.

40:50.824 --> 40:53.659
Besides, even if his family's messed
up, he kills his beloved sister?

40:53.743 --> 40:56.245
-It doesn't make any sense.
-True.

40:56.621 --> 40:58.747
She wasn't molested, though.

41:00.708 --> 41:04.211
So, have you eliminated him
as a suspect,

41:04.295 --> 41:06.004
or is he still active?

41:09.008 --> 41:10.425
-Seriously?
-Seriously.

41:10.510 --> 41:13.303
-Seriously.
-I'm a pariah here.

41:13.847 --> 41:15.472
Vickery, he thinks I'm a threat,

41:15.557 --> 41:18.308
the folks around here,
they fuckin' hate me.

41:19.144 --> 41:20.519
I don't know what I don't know.

41:20.603 --> 41:22.521
That's 'cause you're not from here.

41:23.439 --> 41:24.940
So enlighten me.

41:25.024 --> 41:27.734
And how do you suggest
I do that, Officer?

41:27.819 --> 41:30.821
Show me around Wind Gap.
Give me some history.

41:31.072 --> 41:33.574
Well, we don't have
any toothless corpses in our past,

41:33.658 --> 41:35.325
-if that's your angle.
-That's not what I'm saying.

41:35.410 --> 41:37.870
It could be some old crime
that leads to a hidden motive,

41:37.954 --> 41:39.788
something's been festering.

41:41.291 --> 41:42.708
What do I get out of it?

41:43.960 --> 41:46.128
Other than my charming company?

41:48.590 --> 41:50.257
I'll answer three questions for you.

41:50.341 --> 41:53.051
All right, boys,
let's get out of here. Let's go.

41:56.598 --> 41:57.806
You done drinkin'?

42:00.935 --> 42:03.312
Back in high school
this was the place.

42:03.396 --> 42:05.355
This was party central. It was like

42:05.732 --> 42:08.233
the Midwest Lord of the Flies,

42:08.401 --> 42:10.986
with bonfires and drinkin'

42:12.030 --> 42:13.530
and heavy petting.

42:14.157 --> 42:15.490
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

42:15.575 --> 42:17.743
I can picture you doing that.

42:18.203 --> 42:20.954
Outdrinkin' the boys, leading 'em on.

42:23.124 --> 42:27.836
So let me guess.
You were like a preacher's daughter?

42:28.671 --> 42:30.380
Looks, money, and brains?

42:30.715 --> 42:34.927
Well, looks and money
will get you pretty far in this town.

42:36.179 --> 42:37.638
And brains?

42:37.722 --> 42:39.765
Well, that'll get you
out of this town.

42:40.475 --> 42:42.059
So why'd you leave?

42:43.978 --> 42:45.229
You're funny.

42:46.022 --> 42:47.356
Okay.

42:48.566 --> 42:50.442
-Let's dig deep here.
-Okay.

42:50.652 --> 42:53.612
Favorite color? Favorite ice cream?

42:53.947 --> 42:55.447
Favorite season?

42:57.367 --> 43:00.118
-Can you handle it?
-Yeah, I can handle it. Um...

43:02.330 --> 43:03.872
Black.

43:04.207 --> 43:06.625
Coffee. And winter.

43:08.002 --> 43:10.295
-No one likes winter.
-I like winter.

43:10.380 --> 43:12.381
It gets dark early. I like that.

43:12.632 --> 43:13.966
Why?

43:15.176 --> 43:17.761
Because I like the night, all right?

43:18.096 --> 43:19.346
Leave me alone.

43:19.430 --> 43:21.139
-You leave me alone.
-No. Stop lookin' at me.

43:21.224 --> 43:22.724
Stop hittin' on me.

43:22.809 --> 43:24.351
- You're not my type.
. Okay.

43:24.435 --> 43:26.019
-I know.
-You're not.

43:30.650 --> 43:33.402
Shit.

43:47.792 --> 43:49.001
Dick.

43:50.295 --> 43:52.212
How's it goin', Dickie boy?

43:52.547 --> 43:55.090
-Good. How you doin'?
-I'm good.

43:57.677 --> 44:00.095
Camille and Dickie

44:00.179 --> 44:02.222
Sittin' in a tree

44:02.307 --> 44:03.598
K-I-S-S...

44:03.683 --> 44:07.269
F-U-C-K-I-N-G!

44:08.771 --> 44:10.063
That's cute.

44:10.148 --> 44:11.440
Now, just stop. All right?

44:11.524 --> 44:13.025
I thought you were stayin' in?

44:13.359 --> 44:16.528
Well, I guess you can't trust
Adora's girls, now, can you?

44:16.612 --> 44:19.281
When you said you were going to bed,

44:19.365 --> 44:21.199
I didn't know it was with him.

44:23.244 --> 44:24.619
Dick.

44:25.955 --> 44:27.372
When are you...

44:27.874 --> 44:30.459
When are you gonna
take us for a ride?

44:30.752 --> 44:32.878
Well, I'd have to arrest you first.

44:33.338 --> 44:35.297
Handcuffs and all?

44:36.632 --> 44:38.091
Sexy.

44:38.509 --> 44:40.594
-You girls know about the curfew...
-So...

44:40.678 --> 44:44.264
Are you guys dating now, or what?

44:45.224 --> 44:47.684
'Cause I heard
Camille's a real hot ticket.

44:48.061 --> 44:49.728
Or she was.

44:50.146 --> 44:52.898
You should hear the stories, Dick.
They're pretty hot.

44:52.982 --> 44:56.026
-Amma.
-Ask her about the boys.

44:56.110 --> 44:57.402
-Amma.
-All the boys.

44:57.487 --> 44:58.695
Amma.

45:00.198 --> 45:02.741
All right, ladies, we gotta get goin'.

45:02.825 --> 45:04.409
As always, it was a real pleasure.

45:06.662 --> 45:08.163
Isn't he a gentleman?

45:09.749 --> 45:13.085
Can't solve a crime, but can help
my sister to his crappy-ass car.

45:14.462 --> 45:15.796
Knock it off.

45:15.880 --> 45:18.965
-Look, that's enough. Okay?
-You gonna hit me?

45:19.050 --> 45:20.967
Yeah, you want me to?

45:21.052 --> 45:24.638
Be dangerous.
Be dangerous like Mama said.

45:27.350 --> 45:29.684
You could kill me right here,
and you know what?

45:29.769 --> 45:31.770
Dickie boy
still couldn't figure it out.

45:31.854 --> 45:33.188
Amma, go home.

45:33.523 --> 45:36.691
-Go.
-All right, go home. Okay?

45:36.901 --> 45:38.276
Have fun.

45:38.486 --> 45:39.694
Have fun, Camille.

45:40.738 --> 45:42.030
Nolan!

45:44.909 --> 45:46.993
Speed-racin' motherfuckers!

45:49.288 --> 45:50.956
Here, let me get that.

45:52.667 --> 45:55.293
Shit. Okay, I've got it. I've got it.

45:55.378 --> 45:56.711
All right? Just...

46:02.343 --> 46:04.177
I think I'm gonna walk, all right?

46:04.262 --> 46:05.804
-You sure?
-Yeah.

46:07.849 --> 46:09.224
Hey, pretty ladies!

46:09.308 --> 46:11.017
Come on, don't be so shy.

46:11.602 --> 46:14.354
-Bye, Camille!
-I got a beer with your name on it.

48:42.545 --> 48:46.089
Why?
