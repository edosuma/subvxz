EVERYBODY HATES CHRIS #058
"Everybody Hates Gretzky"
Closed Captioned

00:02.936 --> 00:05.106
CHRIS ROCK:
Since I was the oldest kid
in the house,

00:05.139 --> 00:06.574
whenever something went wrong
with Drew and Tonya,

00:06.607 --> 00:11.212
I got blamed.

00:11.245 --> 00:13.281
What in the world
is going on in here!

00:13.314 --> 00:15.649
Drew and Tonya just ran through
and knocked all this stuff down.

00:15.683 --> 00:16.517
Well, you know better

00:16.550 --> 00:18.152
than to let your brother
and sister run

00:18.186 --> 00:19.320
through the house.
Now, pick it up.

00:22.223 --> 00:24.792
Whether it was something
I couldn't do anything about...

00:24.825 --> 00:26.827
How could you let your sister
get the flu?

00:26.860 --> 00:28.129
How am I supposed
to stop the flu?

00:28.162 --> 00:31.132
...or whether it was something
I didn't know anything about...

00:31.165 --> 00:34.168
Why did you let Drew get hit
in the eye with a baseball?

00:34.202 --> 00:35.336
'Cause I wasn't
at the game.

00:35.369 --> 00:36.704
Either way, I was responsible.

00:36.737 --> 00:39.207
Well, no excuse.
You're his older brother

00:39.240 --> 00:40.808
so you're responsible for him.

00:40.841 --> 00:42.676
You're also responsible
for giving me

00:42.710 --> 00:45.146
another $3.22 worth
of ground beef.

00:45.179 --> 00:47.148
Don't think
he's not using it again.

00:47.181 --> 00:48.349
I'm sorry.

00:51.385 --> 00:53.354
Every now and again
I could stop a problem

00:53.387 --> 00:54.588
before it happened.

00:57.525 --> 00:58.492
Drew.

00:58.526 --> 01:00.161
Drew!

01:01.895 --> 01:03.497
What are you doing here?
You walk to school.

01:03.531 --> 01:04.632
I'm not going to school today.

01:06.767 --> 01:09.237
What do you mean?

01:09.270 --> 01:11.572
I saw Wayne Gretzky
on Donahu yesterday.

01:11.605 --> 01:13.407
He's in town because
the Edmonton Oilers

01:13.441 --> 01:14.508
played the Islanders last night.

01:14.542 --> 01:15.443
So what?

01:15.476 --> 01:17.745
So I'm gonna meet him
and get his autograph.

01:17.778 --> 01:18.779
Are you crazy?
No.

01:18.812 --> 01:20.581
You can't just go off
by yourself.
Yes, I can.

01:20.614 --> 01:21.815
Do you even know where
you're going?
Not really.

01:21.849 --> 01:22.616
Got any money?
No.

01:22.650 --> 01:23.417
What about school?
What about it?

01:23.451 --> 01:24.452
Did you even
think about Ma?
No.

01:24.485 --> 01:26.554
She's gonna kill you
when she finds out.
So?

01:26.587 --> 01:28.122
That's if somebody else
don't kill you first.

01:28.156 --> 01:29.557
I don't care.

01:30.858 --> 01:32.393
Drew, you can't do this.

01:32.426 --> 01:34.628
See ya later.

01:37.931 --> 01:39.867
I was in a no-win situation.

01:39.900 --> 01:42.270
The only thing worse
than going with Drew

01:42.303 --> 01:43.171
was letting him go by himself.

01:43.204 --> 01:44.872
Either way,
if something happened,

01:44.905 --> 01:46.240
I was responsible.

01:53.581 --> 01:55.883
Hold on, man.
I'm coming with you.

01:55.916 --> 01:57.585
Can't blame me if we both die.

02:07.928 --> 02:08.929
* Ah, make it funky now.

02:31.619 --> 02:33.921
Riding on that bus,
I had two goals:

02:33.954 --> 02:36.324
to get that autograph
and get back home.

02:36.357 --> 02:37.325
So what's the plan?

02:37.358 --> 02:38.459
I don't have a plan.

02:38.492 --> 02:40.628
Do you even know
where Gretzky is?

02:40.661 --> 02:42.196
The Long Island
Wilmont Hotel.

02:42.230 --> 02:43.397
And you think
you can walk

02:43.431 --> 02:45.266
right up to the room
and get an autograph?

02:45.299 --> 02:46.500
I haven't thought
that far ahead.

02:46.534 --> 02:47.935
You haven't thought
this far ahead.

02:47.968 --> 02:49.937
All right? We should just
turn around right now.

02:49.970 --> 02:52.340
We'll be late for school,
but, hopefully,

02:52.373 --> 02:53.741
we won't get in
too much trouble.

03:01.449 --> 03:03.984
Well, go on.

03:04.017 --> 03:05.286
That's the whites-only exit.

03:05.319 --> 03:06.520
Forget it.

03:13.994 --> 03:14.962
You look tired.

03:14.995 --> 03:15.963
I'm beat.

03:15.996 --> 03:17.298
I'm going to get some sleep.

03:17.331 --> 03:20.301
Sleep? Well, what
about Tonya?

03:20.334 --> 03:21.302
Hey, Dad.

03:21.335 --> 03:22.570
What are you
doing here?

03:22.603 --> 03:23.637
Why aren't you in school?

03:23.671 --> 03:24.838
'Cause no one's there.

03:24.872 --> 03:26.307
They're all in Philadelphia.

03:26.340 --> 03:29.243
You remember the field trip
to Philadelphia

03:29.277 --> 03:30.311
that cost a hundred dollars

03:30.344 --> 03:31.779
and you didn't want
to pay for it.

03:31.812 --> 03:34.315
Yeah. Instead you gave me
Philadelphia cream cheese.

03:34.348 --> 03:37.318
Right. Well, what are
you gonna do all day?

03:37.351 --> 03:38.952
I mean, I gotta
get some sleep.

03:38.986 --> 03:40.053
Not today.

03:40.087 --> 03:42.990
I've got to go to work, so
you've got to entertain her.

03:43.023 --> 03:45.326
My dad had saved
a hundred bucks,

03:45.359 --> 03:49.497
but he was gonna pay for that
trip one way or another.

03:49.530 --> 03:51.865
This is taking forever.

03:51.899 --> 03:52.900
How long is this ride?

03:52.933 --> 03:54.368
How am I supposed to know?

03:54.402 --> 03:56.036
Didn't you check before
you got on the bus?

03:56.069 --> 03:57.305
Hey, man, calm down.

03:57.338 --> 03:59.006
No, I'm not gonna "calm down."

03:59.039 --> 04:01.875
I don't think you understand how
much trouble we're gonna be in.

04:01.909 --> 04:03.944
I'm not even talking
about Ma anymore.

04:03.977 --> 04:05.346
You know what's gonna happen

04:05.379 --> 04:06.380
when they realize
we're not in school?

04:06.414 --> 04:07.348
What's the big deal?

04:07.381 --> 04:08.649
You always say that they never

04:08.682 --> 04:10.318
pay attention to you
in school anyway.

04:10.351 --> 04:11.885
Drew had a point. Besides Greg,

04:11.919 --> 04:13.587
there was only one person
who would care

04:13.621 --> 04:14.722
if I wasn't in school.

04:16.390 --> 04:18.025
Morning, Shoeshine.

04:18.058 --> 04:19.527
I'm not black.

04:19.560 --> 04:20.928
Why'd you do that?

04:20.961 --> 04:22.963
I don't know where Chris is.

04:24.798 --> 04:26.634
Well, what about you?
Aren't they gonna miss you?

04:26.667 --> 04:27.901
Probably not.

04:27.935 --> 04:28.902
Wrong!

04:28.936 --> 04:30.638
Donna.
Here.

04:30.671 --> 04:32.873
Drew?

04:34.475 --> 04:35.543
Drew?

04:39.046 --> 04:40.381
Oh, my God.

04:40.414 --> 04:42.316
Drew is missing!

04:42.350 --> 04:44.718
Drew is missing!

05:07.107 --> 05:09.943
Back home, my father
tried to shut his eyes

05:09.977 --> 05:11.745
while Tonya shut her ears.

05:20.120 --> 05:21.622
Tonya.

05:21.655 --> 05:23.023
Can't you hear that phone?

05:23.056 --> 05:24.758
It isn't for me.

05:24.792 --> 05:27.428
Everyone I know
is in Philadelphia.

05:27.461 --> 05:29.797
Tonya: 1.
Sleep: 0.

05:36.737 --> 05:37.705
Hello?

05:37.738 --> 05:38.939
Can I speak to Drew's mother?

05:38.972 --> 05:40.508
This is Julius, his father.

05:40.541 --> 05:41.742
Drew never showed up
for school today.

05:41.775 --> 05:42.743
What do you mean?

05:42.776 --> 05:43.977
He wasn't in school today, sir.

05:44.011 --> 05:44.978
Are you sure?

05:45.012 --> 05:45.979
I'm positive.

05:46.013 --> 05:46.980
He wasn't in Homeroom.

05:47.014 --> 05:47.981
Thank you.

05:48.015 --> 05:49.016
You're welcome.

05:50.484 --> 05:51.452
What's wrong?

05:51.485 --> 05:53.120
That was Drew's school.

05:53.153 --> 05:54.455
He didn't show up today.

05:54.488 --> 05:57.124
Maybe he went
to Philadelphia.

05:57.157 --> 05:59.126
I better call your mother.

05:59.159 --> 06:00.894
Where the hell could he be?

06:04.498 --> 06:05.466
We're here.

06:05.499 --> 06:06.500
Yippie.

06:10.471 --> 06:15.809
*

06:15.843 --> 06:17.545
This doesn't look
like Long Island.

06:17.578 --> 06:18.812
This is not.

06:18.846 --> 06:20.247
This is Coney Island.

06:20.280 --> 06:23.851
If this was Survivor, I would
vote Drew off the island.

06:31.191 --> 06:33.160
I can't believe
you got on the wrong bus.

06:33.193 --> 06:34.628
You got on it, too.

06:34.662 --> 06:35.696
I was just
following you, stupid.

06:35.729 --> 06:36.830
Don't you know
the difference

06:36.864 --> 06:38.098
between Coney Island
and Long Island?!

06:38.131 --> 06:40.100
Yeah, Long Island is
the shape of your head.

06:40.133 --> 06:41.569
Shut up!

06:41.602 --> 06:42.536
Hey, shut up.
Don't tell me

06:42.570 --> 06:44.572
what to do.
Hey, break it up!
Break it up!

06:44.605 --> 06:46.039
What's wrong with you two guys?

06:46.073 --> 06:47.575
He got us lost.

06:47.608 --> 06:49.009
Nobody asked your stupid butt
to come anyway!

06:49.042 --> 06:50.043
Where are you heading to?

06:50.077 --> 06:51.645
The Long Island
Wilmont Hotel.

06:51.679 --> 06:53.514
I wanna meet Wayne Gretzky
and get his autograph.

06:53.547 --> 06:55.215
You mean "The Great One"?
Number 99?

06:55.248 --> 06:57.150
Yeah, you're
a hockey fan?

06:57.184 --> 06:58.285
Oh, I love it.

06:58.318 --> 07:00.688
We must be the only three black
hockey fans in New York.

07:00.721 --> 07:02.122
Uh, I'm not a hockey fan.

07:02.155 --> 07:03.557
Well, I guess it's just us then.

07:03.591 --> 07:05.526
And the few guys
playing in the NHL.

07:05.559 --> 07:07.528
What?
Wait, there are
black hockey players?

07:07.561 --> 07:08.729
Oh, yeah.

07:08.762 --> 07:10.097
Willie O'Ree was the first.

07:10.130 --> 07:11.665
Played with the
Boston Bruins.

07:11.699 --> 07:13.834
And now they've got Grant Fuhr.
He plays with Gretzky.

07:13.867 --> 07:15.068
He's a goalie.

07:15.102 --> 07:16.870
Which technically makes him
a target.

07:16.904 --> 07:19.139
Do you know how to get
to Long Island from here?

07:19.172 --> 07:20.941
No, but I'll ask
this gentleman here.

07:20.974 --> 07:22.743
Excuse me, sir?
Mm-hmm.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.645
Would you happen to know
the directions to Long Island?

07:24.678 --> 07:26.880
Yeah.

07:26.914 --> 07:28.482
You're gonna
take that bus

07:28.516 --> 07:30.117
over there to the
Seven Line.

07:30.150 --> 07:31.585
Seven Line.

07:31.619 --> 07:33.754
And then you're gonna take that
to Flushing...

07:33.787 --> 07:35.823
Flushing, stupid!

07:35.856 --> 07:37.725
...and you're gonna take
the Long Island Railroad

07:37.758 --> 07:38.626
to Westbury.

07:38.659 --> 07:40.661
Westbury.

07:40.694 --> 07:41.695
Thank you, sir.

07:41.729 --> 07:42.596
You're welcome.

07:42.630 --> 07:43.631
By the way, I'm Drew

07:43.664 --> 07:44.632
and this is my brother,
Chris.

07:44.665 --> 07:46.066
Hi, I'm Willie O'Ree. Pleasure.

07:47.768 --> 07:50.504
Nice to meet you.

07:50.538 --> 07:51.972
When Willie scored three goals

07:52.005 --> 07:53.607
they didn't call it
the hat trick.

07:53.641 --> 07:54.808
They call it the black trick.

07:56.109 --> 07:57.745
While we were looking
for Gretzky,

07:57.778 --> 07:59.613
back at home,
they were looking for us.

07:59.647 --> 08:01.649
Yeah, I'll hold.

08:03.651 --> 08:05.085
Where you been?

08:05.118 --> 08:06.754
Upstairs in Chris
and Drew's room

08:06.787 --> 08:08.622
looking for clues.
Great idea.

08:08.656 --> 08:09.657
What'd you find?

08:09.690 --> 08:11.659
Well, I found
firecrackers,

08:11.692 --> 08:14.662
smoke balls,
Chris' old test,

08:14.695 --> 08:15.996
looks like he
got an "F"--

08:16.029 --> 08:17.998
maybe we should do
something about that,

08:18.031 --> 08:19.166
Mommy's Turtles--

08:19.199 --> 08:21.034
feels like they ate
half of the box,

08:21.068 --> 08:22.870
and Playpen magazine.

08:22.903 --> 08:25.038
You know they have naked women
in here, right?

08:25.072 --> 08:26.974
Are you still there?
Yes, yes, I'm still here.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.676
So, it appears
Chris hasn't shown up yet.

08:28.709 --> 08:30.544
No, sir.
He's not there?

08:30.578 --> 08:33.113
We'll call you if he does.
Thank you.

08:33.146 --> 08:35.649
I got here as soon as I could.
Any word from Drew?

08:35.683 --> 08:37.985
No, but I just got off the
phone with Chris' school.

08:38.018 --> 08:38.852
And what they say?

08:38.886 --> 08:40.621
He didn't show up for school,
either.

08:40.654 --> 08:42.189
Ooh, they're gonna get it.

08:42.222 --> 08:44.224
When do I not get it?

08:44.257 --> 08:45.859
Well, let's go.

08:45.893 --> 08:47.060
Where are you going?

08:47.094 --> 08:49.062
We're going to look
for Chris and Drew.

08:49.096 --> 08:51.732
We just can't sit around here
all day.

08:51.765 --> 08:53.634
You're looking
at Playpen Magazine

08:53.667 --> 08:55.302
when our sons
are missing?

08:55.335 --> 08:56.103
It was in the...

08:56.136 --> 08:57.671
It was open. It
just fell open.

08:57.705 --> 08:58.672
I...

08:58.706 --> 08:59.740
Let's go!

09:00.841 --> 09:01.274
Come on!

09:01.308 --> 09:02.643
Okay.

09:02.676 --> 09:03.777
Right.

09:03.811 --> 09:06.647
Put it back!

09:06.680 --> 09:10.017
We were headed to the right
place at the wrong time.

09:10.050 --> 09:11.184
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:11.218 --> 09:12.820
Where do you think
you guys are going?

09:12.853 --> 09:15.723
Going to Long Island to get
Wayne Gretzky's autograph.

09:15.756 --> 09:17.758
You're a Gretzky fan?

09:17.791 --> 09:19.259
He's not a
Gretzky fan.

09:19.292 --> 09:20.794
You can't be a
Gretzky fan.

09:20.828 --> 09:21.729
That's what I said.

09:21.762 --> 09:22.796
I'm a Gretzky fan.

09:22.830 --> 09:24.965
He's the
Gretzky fan.

09:24.998 --> 09:26.266
You see me and you?

09:26.299 --> 09:28.268
We don't like the
same things.
No, we don't.

09:28.301 --> 09:30.303
Why don't you guys go someplace?

09:30.337 --> 09:31.805
Where you wanna go?

09:31.839 --> 09:33.807
Where should we go?

09:33.841 --> 09:35.843
The Jersey Shore
would be nice.

09:35.876 --> 09:37.144
But this train
don't go there.

09:37.177 --> 09:38.612
Don't you guys got
enough sports?

09:38.646 --> 09:39.847
Hmm?

09:39.880 --> 09:41.214
Basketball,
football...

09:41.248 --> 09:43.216
Baseball, boxing,
track and field.

09:43.250 --> 09:45.185
You gotta take hockey,
too, huh?

09:45.218 --> 09:46.654
Whoa.

09:46.687 --> 09:48.656
Hold on now.
We ain't trying to take hockey.

09:48.689 --> 09:49.790
But we could.
All right.

09:49.823 --> 09:51.659
So why don't you just leave us
alone?

09:51.692 --> 09:53.827
Translation:
Please pick on us some more.

09:53.861 --> 09:55.896
Is that a hockey
jersey you got?

09:55.929 --> 09:57.898
That is a hockey
jersey.
That is
a hockey jersey.

09:57.931 --> 09:59.066
You don't have a hockey jersey.

09:59.099 --> 10:00.233
No, I don't.
No.

10:00.267 --> 10:01.935
Yeah. Why?

10:01.969 --> 10:03.036
Give it to me.

10:03.070 --> 10:04.104
Give it to him.

10:04.137 --> 10:04.805
Make me.

10:04.838 --> 10:05.773
What?

10:05.806 --> 10:07.107
Whoa.

10:07.140 --> 10:08.809
All right, hold on.

10:08.842 --> 10:10.343
Excuse me.

10:11.378 --> 10:13.280
Drew, give him
the jersey.

10:13.313 --> 10:14.748
I'm not giving them
anything.

10:14.782 --> 10:15.916
Dad gave this to me.

10:15.949 --> 10:17.718
Do you have any idea
where we are?

10:17.751 --> 10:19.753
Yeah, somewhere
on Long Island?

10:19.787 --> 10:20.721
Yeah, exactly.

10:20.754 --> 10:22.956
We're not just surrounded
by two white people.

10:22.990 --> 10:25.358
We're surrounded by a whole
borough of white people.

10:25.392 --> 10:28.395
So, this is us.

10:29.863 --> 10:31.865
And this is them.

10:32.866 --> 10:34.835
So, give him
the jersey.

10:37.838 --> 10:39.807
Wait a minute.

10:39.840 --> 10:41.842
His jersey says "Gritzky."

10:41.875 --> 10:44.444
It's got the wrong
number, too.

10:44.477 --> 10:46.780
Keep the jersey.

10:46.814 --> 10:48.181
Kid, look, if you're gonna
like somebody,

10:48.215 --> 10:49.349
at least get it right.

10:49.382 --> 10:51.051
Get it right.
Get it right.

10:52.052 --> 10:53.854
MAN :
Next stop: Brockman Station.

10:53.887 --> 10:55.355
Man, that was close.

10:55.388 --> 10:57.157
I never thought
I'd say this,

10:57.190 --> 10:59.827
but thank God
for Risky.

11:03.130 --> 11:04.765
Chris and Drew are missing?

11:04.798 --> 11:08.368
No, I haven't seen them,
but I think I can help you.

11:08.401 --> 11:10.337
For just 17 cents a day,

11:10.370 --> 11:12.272
you can adopt one
of these African children.

11:12.305 --> 11:14.775
And the best part is
they don't live with you.

11:14.808 --> 11:16.043
Ooh, can we take Ubingi?

11:16.076 --> 11:17.244
He's so cute.

11:17.277 --> 11:19.813
Not for 17 cents a day.

11:19.847 --> 11:22.950
DISPATCHER:
Had a frivolous suit
with her neighbor.

11:23.784 --> 11:25.018
Missing, huh?

11:25.052 --> 11:27.320
It sounds to me
like they're caught
behind enemy lines.

11:27.354 --> 11:28.789
Don't worry.

11:28.822 --> 11:30.791
This is nothing a recon mission
can't fix.

11:32.325 --> 11:36.396
Right. Take that. Here you go.

11:36.429 --> 11:39.232
All right, let's go.
Come on. Let's go.

11:39.266 --> 11:40.901
Hey, wait, wait!

11:40.934 --> 11:42.035
Hey, hey, boys!

11:42.069 --> 11:44.037
I think I see 'em
after all.

11:44.071 --> 11:45.272
There we go.

11:45.305 --> 11:47.374
Let's leave the nice man alone.

11:47.407 --> 11:48.375
Thank you.

11:48.408 --> 11:49.676
We could use him in Iraq.

11:49.709 --> 11:54.748
DISPATCHER :
Separated the neighbors
at 29211.

11:54.782 --> 11:58.986
Chris and Drew are missing?
Let me see what I can do.

11:59.019 --> 12:01.889
One Adam-12, One Adam-12,

12:01.922 --> 12:03.390
be on the lookout
for Chris and Drew.

12:03.423 --> 12:06.827
Be on the lookout
for Chris and Drew.

12:06.860 --> 12:08.295
Shouldn't be much longer.

12:08.328 --> 12:10.430
Yeah, until they come
and take you away.

12:10.463 --> 12:14.101
Oh, man I can't believe
we're here.

12:14.134 --> 12:16.837
I can't believe I'm actually
gonna meet Wayne Gretzky.

12:16.870 --> 12:17.838
How do I look?

12:17.871 --> 12:19.339
You look like
we need to get

12:19.372 --> 12:20.974
this autograph
and get out of here.

12:21.008 --> 12:24.144
Hi, um, we're looking
for a guest of yours.

12:24.177 --> 12:25.145
Name?

12:25.178 --> 12:25.946
Wayne Gretzky.

12:25.979 --> 12:27.347
Wayne Gretzky,
the hockey player?

12:27.380 --> 12:27.915
Yeah.

12:27.948 --> 12:29.549
He's not staying here.

12:29.582 --> 12:31.852
Are you sure
this is the right hotel?

12:31.885 --> 12:34.855
Positive. At the end of
Donahue, the announcer said,

12:34.888 --> 12:36.323
guests of the
Donahue Show stay

12:36.356 --> 12:37.490
at the Long Island
Wilmont Hotel.

12:37.524 --> 12:40.527
Not all guests. If your leg
was bitten off by a shark,

12:40.560 --> 12:42.195
you have
a terminal disease,

12:42.229 --> 12:44.031
or you're so fat,
you need a crane

12:44.064 --> 12:46.033
to be lifted out of your house,
then you stay here.

12:46.066 --> 12:47.267
Athletes and celebrities
stay somewhere else.

12:47.300 --> 12:49.002
So he's not here?

12:49.036 --> 12:50.871
Sorry. Try one
of the other hotels

12:50.904 --> 12:52.039
on Long Island.

12:52.072 --> 12:53.240
How many other hotels
are there?

12:53.273 --> 12:54.808
I don't know.
About a thousand.

12:54.842 --> 12:56.877
A thousand?

12:56.910 --> 13:00.447
Cheer up. Only 999 more to go.

13:05.986 --> 13:08.021
We were trying
to get an autograph,

13:08.055 --> 13:10.423
but were getting more
than we signed up for.

13:10.457 --> 13:13.026
Chris, I'm sorry, man.

13:13.060 --> 13:14.862
I-I don't know what
I was thinking.

13:14.895 --> 13:16.496
Like Wayne Gretzky
would be hanging out

13:16.529 --> 13:17.898
in some hotel lobby.

13:17.931 --> 13:19.166
Let's go home, man.

13:20.500 --> 13:21.902
Wait, wait, wait.

13:21.935 --> 13:24.104
We can't just give up,

13:24.137 --> 13:25.939
especially when Mom is beating
the living daylights out of me.

13:25.973 --> 13:28.241
I don't want to feel like a fool
'cause it was all for nothing.

13:28.275 --> 13:30.410
We just got
to use our heads.

13:30.443 --> 13:32.212
What do you know
about Gretzky?

13:32.245 --> 13:35.015
Well, I know he's a season
all-time-assist leader,

13:35.048 --> 13:38.151
his mom loves soup,
and he has a sandwich

13:38.185 --> 13:40.020
named after him
called "The Great One."

13:40.053 --> 13:40.921
What's in it?

13:40.954 --> 13:42.923
Hmm, Canadian bacon,

13:42.956 --> 13:44.591
maple syrup, oh, and a pickle.

13:44.624 --> 13:47.961
Oh, and it comes in a bun
shaped like a hockey stick.

13:47.995 --> 13:49.329
Sounds awful.

13:49.362 --> 13:50.998
I never had one.

13:51.031 --> 13:53.166
It was invented by this chef
named Jean Lafleur.

13:54.334 --> 13:56.937
Man, you know way too much stuff
about this guy, Drew.

13:56.970 --> 13:58.571
Hey, you know,

13:58.605 --> 14:00.941
he works in a hotel here
on Long Island.

14:00.974 --> 14:02.142
Who, Gretzky?

14:02.175 --> 14:04.044
No, stupid. Jean Lafleur.

14:04.077 --> 14:05.278
Huh.

14:06.980 --> 14:08.882
Here it is-- "Long Island Hotel,

14:08.916 --> 14:10.884
Home of The Great One."

14:10.918 --> 14:13.086
This has got to be
where he's staying.

14:13.120 --> 14:15.555
I hate to admit it, but
that looks pretty good.

14:15.588 --> 14:16.623
When we get there,

14:16.656 --> 14:19.893
I'm going to have to buy you
one of those sandwiches.

14:19.927 --> 14:21.995
Might as well buy me
a heart attack

14:22.029 --> 14:22.996
with a side of diabetes.

14:24.197 --> 14:26.066
Chris! Drew!

14:26.099 --> 14:27.935
I just don't understand this.

14:27.968 --> 14:29.602
We checked the neighborhoods.
Nobody's seen 'em.

14:29.636 --> 14:31.972
We checked the schools.
Nobody has seen 'em.

14:32.005 --> 14:33.206
I'm calling the police.

14:33.240 --> 14:35.542
Oh, Rochelle, Rochelle?

14:35.575 --> 14:37.978
Are you really going
to call the police?

14:38.011 --> 14:39.546
Yes.
The New York
City Police?

14:39.579 --> 14:41.081
Yes.

14:41.114 --> 14:43.250
My father knew that
if you called the cops

14:43.283 --> 14:45.218
from Bed-Stuy,
this is what happens.

14:45.252 --> 14:47.054
Precinct.

14:47.087 --> 14:48.989
Hello. I-I would
like to report

14:49.022 --> 14:50.157
two missing
children.

14:50.190 --> 14:52.092
Okay. Are they black
or white?

14:52.125 --> 14:53.326
Black.

14:53.360 --> 14:55.062
You have the wrong number.

14:59.099 --> 15:00.500
Let's give it
a couple hours.

15:00.533 --> 15:02.169
I'm sure
they'll show up.

15:02.202 --> 15:04.938
As soon as we got
to the Long Island Hotel,

15:04.972 --> 15:07.074
something told me
we had the right place.

15:07.107 --> 15:08.541
Are all these people here
to see Gretzky?

15:08.575 --> 15:09.676
Yeah, and if

15:09.709 --> 15:12.245
we go over there, we won't have
a chance of meeting him.

15:12.279 --> 15:13.981
So what do we do?

15:15.382 --> 15:18.051
Ilook more like Wayne Gretzky
than that dude.

15:20.553 --> 15:22.522
Come on.

15:22.555 --> 15:24.124
I know what to do.

15:26.459 --> 15:28.361
Hey, what are they doing
over there?

15:28.395 --> 15:30.097
Uh, they're waiting
for Wayne Gretzky.

15:30.130 --> 15:32.632
Who?
He's a hockey player.

15:34.467 --> 15:37.737
Anyway, I got a pizza delivery
for Mr. Smith in Room 412.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.239
Just go.

15:41.174 --> 15:42.242
Man, that was brilliant.

15:42.275 --> 15:44.377
You can get anywhere
with a pizza box.

15:44.411 --> 15:46.479
That's how Bush got
in the White House.

15:46.513 --> 15:47.747
So, now where
do we go?

15:47.780 --> 15:50.083
I mean, there's 32 floors
in this hotel.

15:50.117 --> 15:52.619
Well, I figure Gretzky's
in one of the nicer rooms,

15:52.652 --> 15:54.554
which is probably
on the top floor.

15:54.587 --> 15:56.289
Just call me Sherlock Homeboy.

15:59.126 --> 16:01.761
Hey.

16:11.238 --> 16:13.206
Told you.

16:13.240 --> 16:15.242
All right, let's go.

16:17.544 --> 16:18.745
Excuse me.

16:18.778 --> 16:21.048
I have a delivery
for Mr. Wayne Gretzky.

16:21.081 --> 16:23.050
He didn't order a pizza.

16:23.083 --> 16:25.152
Do I look like
I was born yesterday?

16:25.185 --> 16:27.620
But it is his room?

16:27.654 --> 16:30.357
Get lost, kids.

16:30.390 --> 16:32.659
Sir, I don't think
you understand.

16:32.692 --> 16:34.794
My brother is a
really big hockey fan,

16:34.827 --> 16:37.164
and we skipped school
just to see Mr. Gretzky.

16:37.197 --> 16:38.331
Look, I can't help you.

16:38.365 --> 16:39.732
Yeah, you could.

16:39.766 --> 16:41.434
...so please
leave now.

16:41.468 --> 16:43.470
Come on, Chris.

16:46.206 --> 16:48.308
Gritzky?

16:48.341 --> 16:50.410
Yeah.

16:50.443 --> 16:52.279
My dad bought it for me.

16:52.312 --> 16:54.147
Hockey's not too popular
where we're from.

16:56.283 --> 16:57.650
Where is that?

16:57.684 --> 17:00.120
Here in New York.

17:00.153 --> 17:02.055
Bed-Stuy.

17:03.156 --> 17:05.725
Hey, I'm from Bed-Stuy.

17:07.294 --> 17:09.362
Let me guess.

17:09.396 --> 17:12.199
Did your dad get that jersey
from Risky?

17:12.232 --> 17:14.367
You know Risky?

17:14.401 --> 17:16.736
Yeah, he sold me
a Darryl Raspberry jersey.

17:16.769 --> 17:18.771
I had Dr. K.

17:18.805 --> 17:21.174
:
I haven't see him in years.

17:21.208 --> 17:22.342
So, you think
my brother

17:22.375 --> 17:24.077
can get an autograph
from Mr. Gretzky?

17:24.111 --> 17:25.245
Hey, sorry, kids.

17:25.278 --> 17:26.679
He's not even here.

17:26.713 --> 17:29.182
He has some business
to take care of in the city.

17:29.216 --> 17:30.650
Well, when do you
think he'll be back?

17:30.683 --> 17:32.819
I don't know.
A couple hours, I guess.

17:32.852 --> 17:34.321
A couple hours?

17:34.354 --> 17:35.588
That's not too bad.

17:35.622 --> 17:37.757
Thanks.

17:37.790 --> 17:41.794
By 5:00, my parents had run
out of places to look for us,

17:41.828 --> 17:44.164
but there was only one thing
left to do.

17:44.197 --> 17:46.499
MAN:
Precinct.

17:46.533 --> 17:49.269
Yes, hello! I'd like
to report two missing boys.

17:49.302 --> 17:50.503
Can you describe them, please?

17:50.537 --> 17:51.704
They're white.

17:51.738 --> 17:53.106
Just a minute, ma'am.

17:53.140 --> 17:54.441
Okay, hold-hold on.

17:54.474 --> 17:57.577
Ma'am, you reported
two missing white boys?

17:57.610 --> 17:59.346
Damn!

17:59.379 --> 18:03.216
We waited for Gretzky
like he was giving out cheese.

18:07.154 --> 18:08.788
You guys
are still here?

18:08.821 --> 18:10.157
Yeah. We're waiting
for Gretzky.

18:10.190 --> 18:12.125
You said he'd be back
in a few hours.

18:12.159 --> 18:13.260
Look, he's not
coming back, okay?

18:13.293 --> 18:16.463
He had a change of plans
and went right to the airport.

18:16.496 --> 18:17.564
I'm just
checking out.

18:19.299 --> 18:20.767
That's it.
I give up.

18:20.800 --> 18:24.337
Drew, I'm sorry, but
let's just go home, man.

18:30.643 --> 18:32.412
Hey, wait.

18:36.483 --> 18:38.451
At least his name
is spelled right.

18:38.485 --> 18:40.187
Oh, man!

18:40.220 --> 18:41.454
Thanks!

18:41.488 --> 18:43.623
Gretzky wore that
last night.

18:43.656 --> 18:45.458
You mean, he actually wore this?

18:45.492 --> 18:47.727
Mm-hmm.
Man, I'm never
washing it.

18:47.760 --> 18:50.563
Here you go.
Did Gretzky play
with this puck last night?

18:50.597 --> 18:52.299
No, it's just a puck.

18:52.332 --> 18:54.434
So, how are you guys
getting home?

18:54.467 --> 18:55.668
Taking the train.

18:55.702 --> 18:58.505
You guys ever been
in a limo before?

18:58.538 --> 19:00.907
What do you think?

19:00.940 --> 19:03.576
Even though I was about
to get in more trouble

19:03.610 --> 19:06.446
than I could imagine,
I was glad I was with Drew.

19:06.479 --> 19:09.249
In a strange way,
I actually had a good time.

19:10.450 --> 19:11.684
Okay, listen up, you guys.

19:11.718 --> 19:13.720
We're going to break this search
party up into groups of four.

19:13.753 --> 19:15.355
You-- I want you to
search Varick Street.

19:15.388 --> 19:16.155
Your group--

19:16.189 --> 19:17.624
I want you to go
to Decatur Street.

19:17.657 --> 19:18.791
Your group--

19:18.825 --> 19:20.627
I want you to go
to the bus stops.

19:20.660 --> 19:21.794
And you-- I want you

19:21.828 --> 19:23.696
to search the
alleys, okay?

19:23.730 --> 19:26.899
We're looking for two,
teenaged, dark skin...

19:26.933 --> 19:28.201
white boys.

19:28.235 --> 19:29.969
* Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...

19:30.002 --> 19:31.571
This is going to be bad.

19:31.604 --> 19:33.340
Oh, yeah.

19:33.373 --> 19:34.307
The worst part is,

19:34.341 --> 19:36.343
you didn't even get a chance
to meet Gretzky.

19:36.376 --> 19:37.510
Or Gritzky for that matter.

19:37.544 --> 19:40.313
It's okay. It was still one
of the best days of my life.

19:40.347 --> 19:41.514
Why, 'cause you got
the jersey?

19:41.548 --> 19:42.949
No.

19:42.982 --> 19:45.385
Thanks for taking care
of me, Chris.

19:45.418 --> 19:46.553
I'm glad you were there.

19:46.586 --> 19:48.321
Me, too.

19:48.355 --> 19:50.390
The best part of hanging out
with Drew that day

19:50.423 --> 19:52.825
was for the first time I didn't
see him as my little brother

19:52.859 --> 19:54.394
I was responsible for.

19:54.427 --> 19:57.230
I saw him as something more:
a friend.

19:57.264 --> 19:58.731
Ready?

19:58.765 --> 20:01.234
Ready.

20:01.268 --> 20:03.236
* I've been watching
everything you do *

20:03.270 --> 20:06.306
* Oh, yes, I have

20:06.339 --> 20:08.375
* And I've been wishing...

20:08.408 --> 20:11.010
Chris

20:11.043 --> 20:13.346
No, it's Puffy and Mace.

20:18.385 --> 20:19.952
Bye, y'all.

20:19.986 --> 20:21.954
* Everybody hates Chris.

20:21.988 --> 20:25.992
