05:37.438 --> 05:39.771
Um, there's a lot
to get through,

05:39.773 --> 05:41.606
Because it was
a long weekend,

So we're already

Also, danny was seen

Very inspiring.

06:25.986 --> 06:27.152
Don't do that to me again.

06:27.154 --> 06:28.186
You want to run
things around here?

06:28.188 --> 06:29.354
Then run them.

06:29.356 --> 06:30.489
You forgot to mention
all the reasons

06:30.491 --> 06:32.090
They can cross
mark solano off the list.

06:32.092 --> 06:33.592
Is that what this is?

06:33.594 --> 06:35.494

06:48.609 --> 06:50.675
We're gonna need
to interview your son.

06:50.677 --> 06:52.511
He should have
an appropriate adult with him.

06:52.513 --> 06:54.246
<i>Not you, obviously.</i>

06:54.248 --> 06:55.247

06:55.249 --> 06:56.748
Solano's inside.

06:56.750 --> 07:01.353
We should start.

07:01.355 --> 07:03.455
Hey, I'm--I'm sorry
about yesterday.

07:03.457 --> 07:06.525
With everything going on,
I was a little hazy--

07:06.527 --> 07:10.028
Actually, you lied.

07:10.030 --> 07:14.966
Well, since last week,
all the days have been blurring.

07:14.968 --> 07:17.536
I mean, I hope you
can understand that.

07:17.538 --> 07:19.638
Like, the boiler that--
that I--that I said I fixed?

07:19.640 --> 07:21.706
That was Wednesday night.
I apologize.

07:21.708 --> 07:24.376
So Thursday night,
you were with a friend.

07:24.378 --> 07:25.577
Yeah.

07:25.579 --> 07:27.145
But yesterday,
you couldn't remember

07:27.147 --> 07:29.114
The name of that friend.

07:29.116 --> 07:31.883
Vince.

07:31.885 --> 07:32.951
Who I work with.

07:32.953 --> 07:34.386
So you couldn't remember
the name of the man

07:34.388 --> 07:37.556
You work with all day?

07:37.558 --> 07:41.560
It's just been
a terrible time.

07:41.562 --> 07:43.061
I don't--maybe--
it was shock, maybe.

07:43.063 --> 07:46.731
So you're all right
if she checks with vince?

07:46.733 --> 07:47.566
Yeah.

07:47.568 --> 07:48.567
Go right ahead, I--

07:48.569 --> 07:50.969
<i>Do you know</i>
<i>where this is?</i>

07:50.971 --> 07:55.140
That's the rental place
on harvey ridge.

07:55.142 --> 07:56.808
You ever been there?

07:56.810 --> 07:58.343
Yeah, a-a couple
weeks ago, on a job.

07:58.345 --> 08:00.512
They had a-a burst pipe.

08:00.514 --> 08:01.680
When you say
a couple weeks...

08:01.682 --> 08:03.281
I don't--three weeks,
at the most.

08:03.283 --> 08:05.584
I-I can get the paperwork,
if you want.

08:05.586 --> 08:07.285
I'm not very good
at keeping organized.

08:07.287 --> 08:08.854
If it's a rental property,
who owns it?

08:08.856 --> 08:13.291
The park service,
I told you.

08:13.293 --> 08:15.293
She was right.

08:15.295 --> 08:18.196
Who called you
to do the job?

08:18.198 --> 08:19.598
A woman.

08:19.600 --> 08:20.765
I can't remember the name,

08:20.767 --> 08:23.301
But I picked up the keys
at her trailer park.

08:23.303 --> 08:24.336
Just you or
your friend vince as well?

08:24.338 --> 08:25.337
No, it was just me.

08:25.339 --> 08:26.605
It was an emergency call,

08:26.607 --> 08:32.611
And they thought that
the place was gonna get flooded.

08:32.613 --> 08:36.815
Mark, do you own a boat?

08:36.817 --> 08:37.949
Yeah.

08:37.951 --> 08:39.451
(carver)
a boat.

08:39.453 --> 08:40.785
Prints at the murder scene,

08:40.787 --> 08:42.320
And an alibi
he made up overnight.

08:42.322 --> 08:43.622
You don't know that.

08:43.624 --> 08:45.624
We'll look at the boat,
talk to vince,

08:45.626 --> 08:47.792
And confirm whether
mark did work at the hut.

08:47.794 --> 08:50.328
Ask pete what mark told
beth about Thursday night.

08:50.330 --> 08:51.696
And while we check,
mark stays here.

08:51.698 --> 08:54.633
Do you have any idea what
it would do to that family,

08:54.635 --> 08:56.635
To this town, if it
turns out to be mark?

08:56.637 --> 08:57.969
What are you
looking for, miller?

08:57.971 --> 08:59.838
An easy answer?
Huh?

08:59.840 --> 09:00.639
The least pain?

09:00.641 --> 09:04.776
It doesn't work like that.

09:31.672 --> 09:33.905
Do you think we
should give it away?

I wouldn't rush
into anything.

09:37.878 --> 09:38.743

09:38.745 --> 09:40.412
God, all that time
I had with him,

09:40.414 --> 09:43.882

Enjoyed it more.

10:04.871 --> 10:07.706
The night before
danny was found,

10:07.708 --> 10:09.741
You and chloe were
at home watching tv.

10:09.743 --> 10:12.777
Yeah, we watched
a movie on cable.

He was working?

10:32.065 --> 10:33.898
That's what he said.

11:57.551 --> 11:59.718
This is detective carver.

11:59.720 --> 12:01.853
He's been here already.

12:01.855 --> 12:04.489
Uh-huh. May we come in?

12:04.491 --> 12:06.758
Better not.

Ah.

12:23.543 --> 12:25.376
Mark solano.

12:25.378 --> 12:29.114
At the harvey ridge hut
two weeks ago?

12:29.116 --> 12:30.949
He did not.

12:30.951 --> 12:32.350
Said he got
the keys from you.

12:32.352 --> 12:34.352
No.

12:34.354 --> 12:35.920
Sure about that?

12:35.922 --> 12:39.023
A pipe's never
burst up there.

12:39.025 --> 12:41.192

clean the place?

12:41.194 --> 12:42.427
Ten days ago.

12:42.429 --> 12:43.962

12:43.964 --> 12:45.630
Park service, me.
That's it.

12:45.632 --> 12:47.198
The hut is
a possible crime scene.

12:47.200 --> 12:48.733

Someone will come by.

12:53.073 --> 12:54.105
Is that legal?

12:54.107 --> 12:55.707
It's voluntary.

12:55.709 --> 12:56.875
You just said you wanted us
to catch the killer.

13:04.050 --> 13:07.118
Yeah.

Uh, I was with mark

13:15.061 --> 13:18.129
We just had
some beer, some food.

meet that night?

13:28.809 --> 13:29.841
Just convenient.

doing till 1:00?

13:52.833 --> 13:54.365
I ate a pulled pork sandwich

13:54.367 --> 13:55.800
And some french fries.

13:55.802 --> 13:57.035
Who paid?

13:57.037 --> 14:00.772
You think I can pay on
the salary he gives me?

14:00.774 --> 14:03.942
I don't know, you can ask.

14:03.944 --> 14:06.811

the place was empty.

14:06.813 --> 14:08.947
Anything you just told
detective carver

14:08.949 --> 14:11.683
You'd like to revisit?

14:11.685 --> 14:13.818
No. I--no, I
don't think so.

14:13.820 --> 14:16.120

that you were here

14:16.122 --> 14:18.957
With her Thursday night,

14:18.959 --> 14:22.126
She says that you went out
to the pharmacy around 10:00

14:22.128 --> 14:27.999
To get her some cough medicine.

14:28.001 --> 14:29.868

You know that.

14:32.572 --> 14:36.241
She seems pretty clear
on this one.

15:11.011 --> 15:12.243
She says no pipe burst.

15:12.245 --> 15:15.013
You weren't there.
Well, she's lying.

15:15.015 --> 15:18.082
Or maybe--
number two, your alibi.

15:18.084 --> 15:22.453
Your buddy vince is having
some trouble figuring out

15:22.455 --> 15:24.022
Where he was Thursday night.

I was with him.
Don't

Your son has been killed.

be straight with us.

15:29.029 --> 15:30.028
Why don't you
just be honest?

15:30.030 --> 15:31.062
Let me get to point three.

15:31.064 --> 15:33.898
We took a look
at your boat.

15:33.900 --> 15:37.802
There are bloodstains in it.

15:37.804 --> 15:41.606
Whose blood
is in your boat, mark?

15:41.608 --> 15:45.310
Danny's.

15:45.312 --> 15:50.214
Took the boat out
a couple weeks ago.

15:50.216 --> 15:53.651
You know, for those
couple days of good weather.

15:53.653 --> 15:57.155
And, uh...

15:57.157 --> 15:59.590
It was danny,
chloe, and myself.

15:59.592 --> 16:03.962
And we got three bass,
and we took 'em home for dinner.

16:03.964 --> 16:05.330
But danny was messing around,

16:05.332 --> 16:07.932
And he snagged the end
of the line

16:07.934 --> 16:09.934
To the bottom of his foot,
and it gashed it open.

16:09.936 --> 16:12.737
And he was bleeding
and hopping around, yelling.

16:12.739 --> 16:15.740
Why are you lying about
where you were Thursday night?

16:15.742 --> 16:18.409
How is keeping me here
helping you find danny's killer?

16:18.411 --> 16:20.912
We can't rule you out until
you tell us where you were.

16:20.914 --> 16:22.580
Where I was doesn't matter.
Yeah.

16:22.582 --> 16:25.583
My kid dies, I'd do whatever
I could to help the police.

16:25.585 --> 16:27.752
I just would.

16:27.754 --> 16:28.920
You can remember how many
fish you caught two weeks ago.

16:28.922 --> 16:30.288
You can't remember where
you were Thursday night?

16:30.290 --> 16:32.490

21:39.132 --> 21:41.098
I don't know.

21:41.100 --> 21:44.235
But danny had a phone?

21:44.237 --> 21:47.305
What'd you talk about?

21:47.307 --> 21:49.006
Baseball, skateboards.

21:49.008 --> 21:51.742
You root for the same team?
Giants?

21:51.744 --> 21:53.277
Mariners?

21:53.279 --> 21:55.413
I like the giants,
but danny kind of

21:55.415 --> 21:56.514
Just stopped caring.

21:56.516 --> 21:59.016
Was that a recent thing?

21:59.018 --> 22:02.586
I don't know. I--

did you talk about?

<i>No.</i>

worried about anything?

22:11.764 --> 22:13.864
No.

22:13.866 --> 22:15.933
Did you argue?

22:15.935 --> 22:19.303
No.

who'd want to hurt danny?

Anything you say here
is absolutely confidential.

He said his dad...

22:54.207 --> 22:57.675
Hit him.

22:57.677 --> 22:59.677
Once?

22:59.679 --> 23:02.213
Maybe twice.

23:02.215 --> 23:05.683
Recently?

23:05.685 --> 23:07.351

look for any fibers.

of a gash on his foot.

34:47.453 --> 34:52.255
And he says don't look
for who killed him,

34:52.257 --> 34:56.460
Because he knew
this person well.

34:56.462 --> 35:01.465
And he doesn't
want you to be upset.

35:07.705 --> 35:10.574
That's all.

35:10.576 --> 35:12.375
[sighs]

35:12.377 --> 35:15.378
48 hours gone, because you
were worried about gossip.

35:15.380 --> 35:20.584
No, not gossip.
My family.

35:20.586 --> 35:22.486
You can't tell beth.

35:22.488 --> 35:24.554
That was the first
time, I swear.

35:24.556 --> 35:25.989
What? The first time
with her, or--

35:25.991 --> 35:28.892
No, with--
with anyone.

35:28.894 --> 35:31.461
I've had chances.

35:31.463 --> 35:33.063
I mean, I never did
anything.
<i>[scoffs]</i>

35:33.065 --> 35:34.564
Why would you do this?

35:34.566 --> 35:37.667
You also do
couples counseling?

35:37.669 --> 35:43.140
[door opens, closes]

35:46.477 --> 35:48.145
[sighs]

35:48.147 --> 35:52.782
You know, she never
wanted to marry me?

35:52.784 --> 35:54.251
She had bigger plans.

35:54.253 --> 35:55.752
She wanted to go to college.

35:55.754 --> 35:57.087
She wanted to run track.

35:57.089 --> 35:58.255
Then she got pregnant.

35:58.257 --> 36:00.357
That's my fault.

36:00.359 --> 36:04.194
I thought more of you.

36:08.432 --> 36:10.267
But it was one time, ellie.

36:10.269 --> 36:13.537
It was one time.

36:17.041 --> 36:20.844
And then I lost danny.

36:28.319 --> 36:30.387
Please, don't tell beth.

36:30.389 --> 36:33.023
You're still sure
that's all he's guilty of?

36:33.025 --> 36:37.194
<i>He's got nothing</i>
<i>to do with this?</i>

36:37.196 --> 36:41.364
I don't know.

hey.

37:12.164 --> 37:14.998
Honey...

37:15.000 --> 37:18.068
You all right?

37:18.070 --> 37:19.903
Pete said you
were arrested.

37:19.905 --> 37:20.937
Oh, it was just
a little mix-up.

37:20.939 --> 37:22.038
Cops got confused.

37:22.040 --> 37:23.106
I mean, they're
trying their best.

37:23.108 --> 37:27.244
Come here.
Give me a hug.

37:30.281 --> 37:32.916
Hello, long lost husband.

37:32.918 --> 37:34.217
Who are you again?

37:34.219 --> 37:35.685
Gonna be a little
while longer.

37:35.687 --> 37:37.087
I'm sorry.

37:37.089 --> 37:38.855
How's tom?

37:38.857 --> 37:40.357
You talk to him?

37:40.359 --> 37:41.691
He asked if that
was the end of it.

37:41.693 --> 37:42.692
[sighs]

37:42.694 --> 37:44.027
Think he's all done
with the police.

37:44.029 --> 37:45.795
(ellie)
what'd you tell him?

37:45.797 --> 37:49.065
I said, "I hope so."

37:49.067 --> 37:51.701
And then he asked...

37:51.703 --> 37:54.104
He asked why it had to be you
on this case.

37:54.106 --> 37:55.772
(joe)
why couldn't it be
someone else?

37:55.774 --> 37:58.141
Well, then that someone
would have to work

37:58.143 --> 38:00.277
With emmett carver.

38:00.279 --> 38:01.378
(joe)
he still making you crazy?

38:01.380 --> 38:04.247
No. He's a delightful
human being.

38:04.249 --> 38:06.549
You want me to come over,
and kick his human butt

38:06.551 --> 38:09.386
For you?

38:09.388 --> 38:11.454
Are you there?

38:11.456 --> 38:12.922
Mm-hmm.

38:12.924 --> 38:13.890
(joe)
well, come home soon.

38:13.892 --> 38:15.425
Wake me up.

38:15.427 --> 38:17.227
Ooh, you might regret that.

38:17.229 --> 38:18.728
(joe)
[laughs]
never.

38:18.730 --> 38:19.896
I love you.

38:19.898 --> 38:23.400
(joe)
I love you too.

38:26.904 --> 38:28.104
Yes?

38:28.106 --> 38:30.573
What can I do for you?
Call chloe solano.

38:30.575 --> 38:32.909
Tell her she has to tell us
where she got that cocaine.

38:32.911 --> 38:34.244
Right now?

38:34.246 --> 38:35.812
$500 has to be
linked to the drugs.

38:35.814 --> 38:37.080
All of this must have
something to do

38:37.082 --> 38:38.648
With danny's death.

38:38.650 --> 38:40.083
We're not letting this go
just because she's his sister.

38:40.085 --> 38:43.153
I'm not doing it.

38:43.155 --> 38:45.255
Why not?

38:45.257 --> 38:47.424
Because she
might be sleeping.

38:47.426 --> 38:52.629
Because maybe they've
been through enough already.

38:52.631 --> 38:55.265
Damn it.

38:55.267 --> 38:57.701
Think of the week
they've had.

38:57.703 --> 38:59.602
Think of the day.

Her father just got home.

39:00.972 --> 39:03.039
That's his own fault.

39:03.041 --> 39:04.307
It can wait until tomorrow.

39:04.309 --> 39:06.176
We can discuss it--

39:06.178 --> 39:07.177
We've had this
discussion, miller.

39:07.179 --> 39:08.611
I've got actual
evidence to explore.

39:08.613 --> 39:10.113
You're telling me
to lay off?

39:10.115 --> 39:11.181
She's 15 years old.

39:11.183 --> 39:12.215
She cried to you.

39:12.217 --> 39:13.350
You know the family.

39:13.352 --> 39:16.219
All due respect, sir...

39:16.221 --> 39:19.522
Move away from me.

where you were?

39:45.584 --> 39:49.853
Yeah.

39:49.855 --> 39:53.990
Are you gonna tell me?

39:53.992 --> 39:58.161
Not now.

39:58.163 --> 40:01.431
Look at me.

40:05.269 --> 40:09.105
Did you kill him?

40:09.107 --> 40:10.273
What?

40:10.275 --> 40:14.411
Did you kill danny?

40:14.413 --> 40:17.113
Babe, how could
you even say that?

40:17.115 --> 40:18.248
[sighs]

40:18.250 --> 40:19.349
Is that what
you're thinking?

40:19.351 --> 40:22.685
All you have
to do is say no, mark.

40:22.687 --> 40:26.923
You think I could hurt danny?

40:26.925 --> 40:31.428
Is that what you see
when you look at me?

41:18.577 --> 41:20.743
I'm calling for you.

41:20.745 --> 41:27.116
I need you to tell me
who gave you that cocaine.

Do you hear me?
Yeah.

You have till
tomorrow to think about it.

I'll need an answer
in the morning.

Hey.

Hey.

You didn't have to
do that, by the way.

Tell 'em.

It got you out.

41:55.981 --> 41:57.780
It did.

I don't know how
you're even breathing.

42:00.519 --> 42:02.452
I mean, I can
barely stand this.

42:02.454 --> 42:03.786
You mean danny?

42:03.788 --> 42:07.223
Yeah, danny, and--
and what we did, and...

42:07.225 --> 42:08.491
Him dying.

42:08.493 --> 42:10.193
It just all feels like it
was wrapped up together.

It is.

Well, it shouldn't be.

Oh, it is.

42:14.032 --> 42:15.031
That's my punishment.

Well, see, what we did,
that was a terrible mistake.

It was a stupid,
terrible mistake.

like anything but.
