[pulsating music]

00:35.042 --> 00:38.083
[music continues]

01:02.625 --> 01:03.625
[Adam] Chris...

01:03.708 --> 01:05.750
You're sure about this mate?
It seems a bit, well

01:06.083 --> 01:07.083
extreme.

01:07.625 --> 01:09.333
Extreme? Really, mate?

01:09.750 --> 01:10.958
No, what's extreme is getting

01:11.000 --> 01:12.750
my fucking legs
broken by those Russians

01:12.833 --> 01:13.875
if we don't pay them back.

01:14.208 --> 01:15.583
Remember, this
is your fault, Adam.

01:15.750 --> 01:18.083
You know what, sometimes I wish
I'd listened to my mother.

01:18.208 --> 01:20.083
She always said you
were a bad influence, mate.

01:20.667 --> 01:22.375
And if I did we wouldn't
be here right now.

01:22.625 --> 01:23.625
Alright get ready. Let's go.

01:26.583 --> 01:28.458
Don't you fucking move,
don't you fucking move.

01:28.542 --> 01:29.542
[shotgun blast]

01:30.333 --> 01:31.500
Stay in the car. Don't move.

01:31.542 --> 01:33.458
Go to the front of the van.
You won't get hurt.

01:33.500 --> 01:34.542
Don't you fucking move.

01:34.792 --> 01:37.792
[suspenseful music]

01:41.250 --> 01:43.083
Chris, where are you going,
you little scroll?

01:43.167 --> 01:44.875
You're not going out
with that Adam Chopra.

01:44.958 --> 01:46.667
-You've got homework to do.
-Hey, let's go.

01:47.417 --> 01:48.417
See you later, mom.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
Christopher!

01:50.292 --> 01:51.750
Come back here, you little shit.

01:52.208 --> 01:54.208
You wait till your father
hears about this.

01:54.667 --> 01:56.667
I give up. I really do.

01:57.208 --> 01:59.042
It's so cool that you've
got soccer pitches in

01:59.125 --> 02:01.625
-every park here.
-Chris, you've lived here
for a year now.

02:01.708 --> 02:03.500
It's football.
No one calls it soccer.

02:03.750 --> 02:06.500
-Maybe.
-Oh, shit. Chris! Danny.

02:08.458 --> 02:10.750
Well, well, if it isn't
Rosie and his girlfriend.

02:11.250 --> 02:12.625
We've all told you
she's my pitch.

02:13.333 --> 02:15.000
-Come on, let's go.
-No.

02:15.458 --> 02:18.042
If you think you have skills
to pay the bills, prove it.

02:18.833 --> 02:19.917
Play me one on one.

02:20.250 --> 02:21.458
Whoever scores first wins.

02:23.292 --> 02:26.333
[scuffling with the ball]

02:40.167 --> 02:41.375
[kicking the ball]

02:41.458 --> 02:44.500
[loud cheering]

02:53.042 --> 02:55.500
[commentator]
Well, this season's
similar to that of last year

02:55.542 --> 02:57.708
and the chance to win though
just about slammed shut.

02:58.042 --> 02:59.375
The question on everyone's lips

02:59.500 --> 03:02.292
is surely, Chris Rose is
off to the Premier League.

03:02.333 --> 03:04.667
You're right, but rumors
flying around Chris are

03:04.708 --> 03:06.542
that he's only interested
in leaving Loughford

03:06.667 --> 03:07.750
if he's for East Stratford.

03:08.125 --> 03:09.375
So what's the hold up then?

03:09.458 --> 03:11.958
His stats are clearly up there
with some of the best of them.

03:12.042 --> 03:14.083
Look, for me he's a
great talent, you can see that.

03:14.125 --> 03:16.542
Great ability, everything
he does in a game, you know

03:16.583 --> 03:17.667
excites the crowd.

03:17.917 --> 03:19.375
If I'm McLaren
I'll keep bidding for

03:19.458 --> 03:21.667
for Chris. Eventually you see
his love for the one club

03:22.042 --> 03:23.292
where have you gone from there.

03:23.500 --> 03:24.500
And his second?

03:24.750 --> 03:27.167
Well, let's be fair, you've
seen some good sides to him.

03:27.250 --> 03:28.833
Then you've seen
the hothead side of him

03:28.917 --> 03:30.833
and you've seen a temper
which he can't control.

03:31.083 --> 03:33.125
And, you know, for me,
have a look at this

03:33.167 --> 03:34.375
last month, for Ashchester.

03:34.917 --> 03:37.333
[commentator] Out wide
by Edwards, to Rose.

03:38.417 --> 03:39.708
Oh, and that's not pretty.

03:39.833 --> 03:42.000
Rose and Marcel Remi
have collided.

03:42.042 --> 03:43.125
That was inevitable.

03:43.208 --> 03:44.875
Those two players
hate each other.

03:44.958 --> 03:46.958
That's the thing, when you
have a player like that

03:47.208 --> 03:48.708
you can lose at any given time.

03:48.750 --> 03:50.542
You have to have an
exceptionally good reason

03:50.625 --> 03:52.792
-to want to take him on, right?
- I personally think the Knights

03:52.875 --> 03:55.042
would be foolish not to
consider him this time round

03:55.125 --> 03:57.208
because we lost
Terry Donovan and Jonny Love.

03:57.292 --> 03:59.417
He falls in from midfield...
[commentator's voice fades away]

04:00.583 --> 04:01.583
[car door closes]

04:01.625 --> 04:04.667
[car drives away]
[contemplative music]

04:06.958 --> 04:08.208
[man's voice] As we say, Chris

04:08.500 --> 04:10.083
we've dealt with
the boring details

04:10.458 --> 04:11.458
and we believe

04:11.958 --> 04:13.500
you've got a really
good package there.

04:13.875 --> 04:16.333
[woman's voice] Sign it, Chris.
I promise it's a good deal.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.542
And this time next week,
you'll be playing out there.

04:20.708 --> 04:22.833
[pen on paper]

04:23.292 --> 04:25.875
-Welcome to the team, sir.
-Oh, thank you.
It's a dream come true.

04:25.958 --> 04:26.958
Well done, kid.

04:27.500 --> 04:29.167
We're gonna get you
working straight away.

04:29.667 --> 04:32.333
We've got a whole publicity
press package waiting for you.

04:32.583 --> 04:34.458
Time to let the world know
you're a Knight now.

04:34.542 --> 04:35.833
Yeah, you know
the kind of thing.

04:36.292 --> 04:38.167
Handle the shirt, meet the team

04:38.250 --> 04:39.917
-a few photos--
-And remember, Chris.

04:40.083 --> 04:43.000
-The press will be
on your back from now on.
-Absolutely.

04:43.125 --> 04:44.583
I've worked so hard
for this moment.

04:44.667 --> 04:46.042
Nothing I'm gonna do
to mess it up.

04:46.125 --> 04:47.917
I just gotta make
one quick phone call first.

04:47.958 --> 04:50.125
And I'll crack on with the
press call laid out for me.

04:50.625 --> 04:51.625
Mom, it's me.

04:52.417 --> 04:54.000
Chris? Everything all right?

04:54.083 --> 04:55.125
Yes, I'm fine, Mom.

04:55.667 --> 04:57.417
Listen, I didn't want to
say anything before

04:57.458 --> 04:58.792
because it wasn't confirmed, but

04:59.792 --> 05:00.833
I've just become a Knight.

05:01.208 --> 05:02.958
Aaahh! Chris!

05:03.292 --> 05:05.875
-Mom, calm down, calm down.
-Oh, this is wonderful news.

05:06.208 --> 05:07.750
I'm so proud of you.

05:08.333 --> 05:09.917
I can't wait to
tell Auntie Jean.

05:10.708 --> 05:11.708
Thanks, Mom.

05:12.042 --> 05:13.708
Listen, don't say
anything until tomorrow

05:13.750 --> 05:16.167
because they've got a whole
press thing laid out for me,
but...

05:16.333 --> 05:18.208
Mom, I just wanted you
to be the first to know.

05:19.792 --> 05:20.792
Mom.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.583
What do you think
Dad would've thought?

05:23.625 --> 05:26.000
Oh Chris, he'd have been
so made up for you.

05:26.792 --> 05:29.625
He loved taking you to the
old East Stratford ground and

05:30.292 --> 05:32.167
to see you play in
the Black Knight colors...

05:33.208 --> 05:34.208
Well

05:34.417 --> 05:36.208
proud seems too small a word.

05:36.500 --> 05:37.500
Thanks, Mom.

05:37.583 --> 05:40.625
[crowd cheering]

05:50.833 --> 05:53.917

06:06.375 --> 06:07.375
Ohh.

06:13.250 --> 06:14.250

06:52.542 --> 06:53.542
Little boy.

06:54.083 --> 06:56.458
Do you know where
Adam Chopra lives?

06:56.792 --> 06:58.375
I do. Yeah, he lives over there.

06:58.458 --> 06:59.458
[can opens]

07:03.042 --> 07:04.042
Ahhh.

07:07.042 --> 07:08.167
[tense music]

07:08.250 --> 07:09.625
What the hell
are they doing here?

07:09.667 --> 07:11.042
[tense music]

07:11.125 --> 07:12.125
[kicks can]

07:12.167 --> 07:15.208
[music continues]

07:19.750 --> 07:21.667
Where the hell is it?
[rummaging through drawer]

07:23.500 --> 07:24.500
Got it.

07:24.583 --> 07:27.625
[music continues]

07:30.083 --> 07:31.208

Oh, man. Why do you
have to be so high, man?

07:47.583 --> 07:49.000
[grunting]
I'm going to fall.

07:50.375 --> 07:51.708
Better be...

07:53.750 --> 07:54.792
What do they want from me?

07:54.875 --> 07:56.917
[banging on door]

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
[tense music continues]

08:03.917 --> 08:05.042
Let's go round the back.

08:08.083 --> 08:11.083

[car door opens]

08:26.083 --> 08:27.167
[car door closes]

08:31.167 --> 08:33.708
OK, ladies and gentlemen,
I think we're ready to start.

08:35.292 --> 08:36.292
Here at East Stratford

08:37.042 --> 08:39.000
I'm very proud of
the team we've built

08:39.667 --> 08:42.083
and often see them as
a high-performance car.

08:42.583 --> 08:44.917
But even the very best
of engines need a tune-up.

08:45.292 --> 08:47.417
I know that working here
has always been your dream.

08:47.792 --> 08:50.292
And I know you're
gonna do everything
you can to make it work.

08:50.958 --> 08:52.792
But I just need you
to do me one favor.

08:52.875 --> 08:54.583
What's that? Signing fee
wasn't big enough?

08:54.667 --> 08:56.667
[laughs]
No, Chris, I'm serious.

08:57.375 --> 08:58.375
Look.

08:58.875 --> 09:00.208
Whenever you're out on the pitch

09:00.458 --> 09:02.583
whenever you're on
the grass, just keep smiling.

09:03.208 --> 09:04.625
No matter what surprises happen

09:05.208 --> 09:06.208
you just keep smiling.

09:06.333 --> 09:07.458
Without further ado

09:07.792 --> 09:09.833
I'd like to introduce you
to our new center forward

09:10.042 --> 09:13.042
Chris Rose.

put him on the car lift.

10:26.042 --> 10:27.042
Hello?

10:27.125 --> 10:28.125
Adam.

10:28.250 --> 10:29.250
It's Viktor.

10:29.833 --> 10:30.833
Oh, Viktor. Oh.

10:31.208 --> 10:32.208
How are you?

10:32.250 --> 10:34.125
Adam, no more excuses.

10:34.583 --> 10:36.292
Danny would like to see you.

10:37.292 --> 10:38.333
OK, broth' where?

10:38.625 --> 10:39.625
In one hour.

10:40.125 --> 10:41.125
Danny's house.

11:05.208 --> 11:07.125
[muffled grunts]

11:09.917 --> 11:12.583
Are you ready to tell me
about their operations?

11:12.667 --> 11:13.667
[muffled grunt]

11:14.208 --> 11:15.208
[inaudible]

11:15.500 --> 11:17.625
I need to take the table first.

11:18.125 --> 11:19.125
Images.

11:19.833 --> 11:22.042
[tape ripped off]
Oh, fuck sake!

11:22.667 --> 11:24.458
Let me go, you psychotic bitch.

11:24.875 --> 11:27.417
Such big words for
a man in your position.

11:27.458 --> 11:28.458
Now tell me

11:28.667 --> 11:30.250
about their operations.

11:30.333 --> 11:32.458
[muffled sounds]
Speak up, you little shit!

11:32.500 --> 11:34.500
[muffled sounds]
I think he's trying to tell you.

11:34.542 --> 11:36.250
It's just, he's got
a gun in his mouth.

11:37.292 --> 11:38.292
[muffled sound]

11:40.333 --> 11:41.333
[panting]

11:42.333 --> 11:43.333
I'm sorry.

11:43.417 --> 11:45.208
I don't know anything
about their operations.

11:45.250 --> 11:47.250
[panting]
Look.

11:48.583 --> 11:50.500
We can do this the easy way

11:51.167 --> 11:53.292
or we can do it the hard way.

11:54.250 --> 11:56.792
Well, get your girlfriend off me
and I'll tell you what I know.

11:57.250 --> 11:59.208
I am not his girlfriend!

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
I am nobody's girlfriend.

12:04.417 --> 12:07.000
You know, it's a shame
that you don't know anything.

12:07.583 --> 12:09.167
Wait! Wait!

12:09.250 --> 12:10.625
[drilling sound]

[indistinct chatter]

12:31.083 --> 12:34.167
[upbeat music]

12:35.167 --> 12:37.667
OK, guys. There's only a few
of us here today because

12:37.750 --> 12:39.708
we're testing Marcel
and Chris' fitness.

12:40.250 --> 12:42.208
So I'm gonna be going
quite hard on you two today

12:42.250 --> 12:44.500
but don't worry about it,
let's just see how you get on.

12:44.583 --> 12:47.625
[fast-paced song]

13:11.250 --> 13:13.125
[song fades away]

13:13.500 --> 13:14.583
[car trunk closes]

13:14.833 --> 13:16.083
Demetri won't be happy.

13:16.708 --> 13:18.375
He was sure John
could build the list.

13:19.917 --> 13:22.542
Take it to the crusher.
I have somewhere I have to be.

13:24.917 --> 13:27.375
Adam, have a whiskey
with me, please.

13:27.417 --> 13:28.625
Sure, this could be great.

13:31.958 --> 13:32.958
Now.

13:33.250 --> 13:34.292
Down to business.

13:34.708 --> 13:36.417
You know why I want
to see you, don't you?

13:36.458 --> 13:39.792
-Danny, I promise you
I'll get you all the money.
-Hold on, hold on, hold on.

13:40.125 --> 13:41.458
Typical Adam Chopra.

13:41.583 --> 13:43.958
Never fully
understanding the situation.

13:44.542 --> 13:46.583
See, it's not my money.

13:46.667 --> 13:47.833
I've got partners.

13:48.083 --> 13:49.417
People I work with.

13:49.583 --> 13:52.458
But I can't owe
those Russians. They'll send
those two freaks after me.

13:52.667 --> 13:55.167
-Shit. That's why they
came to my house yesterday.
-Ah.

13:55.708 --> 13:59.292
Finally, he gets
the full picture.

14:00.542 --> 14:01.750
You know, Adam, don't you?

14:02.833 --> 14:05.083
-Of course.
-Is that old guy with you too?

14:05.500 --> 14:06.500
No.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.208
Just me and Danny.

14:10.750 --> 14:12.125
See, Adam, I like you.

14:12.417 --> 14:13.875
Me, you, Rose-y

14:14.000 --> 14:15.125
are old school friends.

14:15.208 --> 14:17.250
So it's only right
I give you this opportunity

14:17.292 --> 14:19.375
to get your
fucking affairs in order.

14:19.875 --> 14:20.875
Put it this way.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.208
Next time, you'll be
seeing either Dimitri

14:23.875 --> 14:26.083
-or Alexei.
-You could always earn it back.

14:26.958 --> 14:29.000
Alexei's running a
booking gig tonight.

14:29.542 --> 14:30.625
I'll do that, then.

14:33.375 --> 14:35.542
Good luck, Adam.
You can see yourself out.

14:38.958 --> 14:40.542
Excuse me. Are you Danny Rana?

14:40.833 --> 14:42.375
No, sorry mate. He's upstairs.

14:42.458 --> 14:45.458
[tense music]

14:53.042 --> 14:54.042
[gunshot]

14:54.708 --> 14:55.708
[gunshot]

14:58.708 --> 15:01.750
[fast-paced music]

15:10.042 --> 15:11.042
[grunts]

15:12.125 --> 15:13.208
Out of my way, fag.

15:14.667 --> 15:16.208
You can keep your shirt on.

15:17.167 --> 15:19.167
You'd like that, won't you,
for me to take it off.

15:19.292 --> 15:20.292
Marcel.

15:20.583 --> 15:21.667
Get a drink and cool off.

15:23.042 --> 15:24.833
I didn't realize you had
the bet on Ozzie.

15:25.500 --> 15:27.500
Maybe that's why he's
acting so much on the field.

15:28.083 --> 15:30.542
Sorry, are you talking to me
mate? Save it for the pitch, OK?

15:31.125 --> 15:32.292
You can't stand it, can you?

15:33.125 --> 15:34.250
What are you talking about?

15:34.542 --> 15:36.167
That you're a little bit
slower than me?

15:36.542 --> 15:38.000
Did you have
a late night last night?

15:38.083 --> 15:39.542
Or too many
croissants for breakfast?

15:40.542 --> 15:43.417
Oh yes, I partied
a little bit too hard
last night, with your mother.

15:43.875 --> 15:46.458
But you know what it's like when
you get the deal of a lifetime.

15:46.542 --> 15:49.208
I'm not fighting
with my new teammate
on our first day at practice.

15:50.292 --> 15:51.750
You're fighting with an
Englishman, Rose.

15:51.917 --> 15:53.917
You create a scene in
front of everybody, but look

15:54.500 --> 15:56.292
everybody knows
I'm the better player.

15:56.875 --> 15:59.000
That is why I get paid
twice as much as you.

15:59.917 --> 16:02.167
Like I said, Marcel,
save it for the pitch.

16:04.583 --> 16:06.167
Now don't fuck me around

16:06.250 --> 16:08.583
but is it true that Marcel
got twice the deal I did?

16:09.417 --> 16:10.417
Umm.

16:10.833 --> 16:13.583
-Who told you?
-It doesn't fucking
matter who told me.

16:13.708 --> 16:16.000
You didn't tell me.
So is it true?

16:16.917 --> 16:20.792
-Yeah, you have eventually come
out but...
-No Toni, you let me down.

16:21.042 --> 16:23.875
First you didn't tell me
about Marcel even
joining East Stratford

16:24.042 --> 16:26.250
and now I hear he's got a
better fucking deal than me.

16:26.500 --> 16:28.708
But still, at least
you got your cut, right?

16:29.167 --> 16:32.583
Look, I could find out about
Marcel until after you'd signed.

16:33.125 --> 16:35.458
I don't want to be contentious,
I figured out just let you

16:35.500 --> 16:36.667
find out in good time.

16:37.417 --> 16:39.708
Therefore you wouldn't
do anything rash, like

16:40.333 --> 16:42.583
back out the contract
that you've always wanted.

16:42.750 --> 16:44.500
Not fucking good enough!

16:44.667 --> 16:45.750
You should have warned me.

16:45.792 --> 16:47.292
You should have
gotten me more money.

16:47.375 --> 16:48.375
Oh, really?

16:48.875 --> 16:50.292
Well, you changed your tune.

16:50.792 --> 16:52.750
For the past three years
you've been saying to me

16:52.833 --> 16:55.042
get me an East Stratford
contract, no matter what.

16:55.750 --> 16:56.917
Well, guess what, Chris?

16:57.083 --> 16:59.333
This is what a
"no matter what"
looks like.

16:59.792 --> 17:01.542
Fuck you, Toni,
thanks for everything.

17:04.458 --> 17:05.500
[cellphone against wall]

17:05.542 --> 17:06.750
Channel Six News
has been talking

17:06.792 --> 17:08.583
to the Premier League
club East Stratford

17:08.750 --> 17:10.083
who found
themselves at the center

17:10.167 --> 17:13.417
of a controversial decision
to sign two former
on-pitch adversaries

17:13.625 --> 17:15.500
Marcel Remi and
Christopher Rose.

17:15.750 --> 17:18.375
While fans have been
outspoken with their
thoughts on this decision

17:18.542 --> 17:20.250
the club's chairman
is yet to comment.

17:20.417 --> 17:22.833
Our reporter Kirsty Simpson's
at the Knights training ground

17:22.917 --> 17:25.750
where the new-look team
has just finished
their first training session.

17:25.833 --> 17:27.833
I've been talking with
some of the fans here today

17:27.917 --> 17:29.625
and the reaction to
this news is very mixed

17:29.917 --> 17:30.958
but in general

17:31.000 --> 17:33.125
most fans are, for want
of a better phrase

17:33.167 --> 17:36.625
intrigued to see if
Rose and Remi can
actually play together well.

17:36.708 --> 17:39.125
Dad, Dad! Can I go get
Chris Rose's autograph?

17:39.167 --> 17:41.125
[indistinct chatter]

17:41.875 --> 17:43.000
Here comes the team now.

17:43.083 --> 17:44.875
[camera shutters]

17:45.042 --> 17:46.542
-Hello guys, let's go.
-Chrisman.

17:46.833 --> 17:47.833
I can't see.

17:48.292 --> 17:50.292
Chrisman. I can't see.

17:50.375 --> 17:51.583
Get out of the way.

17:52.375 --> 17:53.958
Stop pushing me. Get off.

17:54.792 --> 17:55.792
Dad!

17:55.917 --> 17:57.917
Help, Dad! Dad, help!

17:58.375 --> 17:59.458
He's pushing me.

18:00.542 --> 18:01.833
I can't breathe.

18:02.417 --> 18:03.417
Dad!

18:04.083 --> 18:05.083
Someone, help!

18:06.542 --> 18:08.958
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Careful, careful, careful!

18:09.417 --> 18:11.958
Boy, you all right? Come here.
Come on. You all right, kid?

18:12.125 --> 18:13.917
-What's your, what's your name?
-It's Josh.

18:14.042 --> 18:15.083
Josh. Where's your dad?

18:15.625 --> 18:17.250
-Over there.
-I'm here, I'm here.

18:18.542 --> 18:20.667
-Everything all right?
-Yeah, Josh seems fine.

18:21.625 --> 18:23.250
Umm, do you both
have a spare hour?

18:24.500 --> 18:25.583
Cool. Come with me.

18:28.542 --> 18:30.042
Marcel.
[indistinct calls for Marcel]

18:35.917 --> 18:36.958
Thanks for this, Chris.

18:37.333 --> 18:39.000
He's having a fantastic time.

18:39.083 --> 18:40.375
He'll remember this forever.

18:40.583 --> 18:42.625
I would have loved to
tour the stadium with my dad.

18:42.708 --> 18:45.167
Besides, I want him to remember
the good memories from today.

18:45.250 --> 18:46.833
Not what happened
on the training pitch.

18:46.917 --> 18:48.417
Well, thank you, Chris.

18:48.875 --> 18:50.208
From the bottom of my heart.

18:51.125 --> 18:53.250
But Josh is not really an
East Stratford fan, though.

18:53.917 --> 18:55.000
He's a Chris Rose fan.

18:55.417 --> 18:57.083
He's been following
your career ever since

18:57.125 --> 18:59.792
-he got into football.
-Wow, I didn't realize that.
Thank you.

19:01.042 --> 19:03.458
You've done so much more for him
than you can possibly know.

19:03.500 --> 19:04.500
You see

19:04.708 --> 19:07.208
Josh has recently been diagnosed
with a rare blood condition.

19:08.500 --> 19:10.667
We've heard there's a
possible cure in America, but

19:11.750 --> 19:13.000
we can't afford the treatment.

19:13.083 --> 19:16.125
[tender music]

19:19.417 --> 19:22.417
[upbeat dance song]

19:51.667 --> 19:53.042
Complimentary drinks.

19:53.542 --> 19:55.167
A man could get used to this.

19:55.292 --> 19:57.750
Now you're in the Premiership
we can get to anywhere we want.

19:57.792 --> 19:59.750
True, mate, but hope
it gets a little bit easier

19:59.792 --> 20:01.292
than was my first day
being a Knight.

20:01.333 --> 20:03.333
Stays like that I don't
know if I can keep it up.

20:03.375 --> 20:05.042
Everyone has first
day problems, mate.

20:05.125 --> 20:06.667
It'll be better on
Monday, you'll see.

20:06.750 --> 20:09.000
Just have a good night,
forget about everything, yeah?

20:10.500 --> 20:11.500
Bro!

20:11.542 --> 20:13.333
Get over there, those
two girls winding us up

20:13.417 --> 20:14.833
Get your game face on, let's go!

20:14.875 --> 20:16.167
I don't think you get it, Adam.

20:16.500 --> 20:18.667
I've been waiting so long
to for sign East Stratford.

20:18.792 --> 20:20.333
-It's a dream job.
-Yeah, and mine.

20:20.375 --> 20:21.917
And then they went
and screwed it up by

20:22.000 --> 20:23.833
-signing this French
prick Marcel.
-So what?

20:23.917 --> 20:26.250
Now I feel pathetic for even
worrying about those things.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.792
Are and Toni, the money.

20:29.625 --> 20:30.792
All I can think about

20:31.000 --> 20:32.500
is the fact that
this poor little boy

20:32.583 --> 20:34.667
is never gonna have
these opportunities in his life.

20:34.833 --> 20:37.083
Oh my god!

20:37.375 --> 20:39.375
Look, Chris, but I'm sorry.
I really want to help

20:39.458 --> 20:42.167
but something really
important has just come up.

20:43.417 --> 20:44.833
No, you're right, Adam, mate.

20:44.958 --> 20:46.208
Time and a place and all that.

20:46.583 --> 20:48.458
Drink up. Let's go buy
those girls some drinks.

20:48.875 --> 20:50.625
But wait, mate.
Promise me one thing.

20:51.250 --> 20:52.458
No cheesy pickup lines.

20:52.708 --> 20:54.667
Ah, I got a really sick one
for tonight, broth.

20:55.458 --> 20:58.625
-Go on and lose it.
-Oh, no no no.
No previews, bruv.

21:02.375 --> 21:04.208
-Hi girls. We--
-Um, I'm sorry.

21:04.292 --> 21:05.667
I know it's taking
a lot of courage

21:05.708 --> 21:07.917
to come over here, especially
when there's three of us

21:07.958 --> 21:10.125
and two of you. And although
I appreciate your courage

21:10.208 --> 21:11.833
we'd much rather be
on our own right now.

21:12.167 --> 21:14.083
-I bet you three girls are
from Ireland.
-Why is that?

21:14.250 --> 21:15.292
It's when I look at you.

21:15.583 --> 21:18.542
-Dublin...
-It's what those guys
over there would have said.

21:18.833 --> 21:21.333
Girls, we just want to come over
and offer to buy you a drink.

21:21.500 --> 21:22.542
If I'm honest with you

21:22.625 --> 21:24.792
if we sit with you it will
stop all those other creeps

21:24.875 --> 21:26.208
from using cheesy pickup lines.

21:30.042 --> 21:32.375
All right, I'm Adam, and you
must recognize my mate Chris

21:32.417 --> 21:35.042
-over there.
-This is Nicola, Dawn
and I'm Ashley.

21:35.083 --> 21:36.542
-Ashley Queen.
-Really?

21:36.833 --> 21:38.375
That must be fake,
because I'm a name.

21:38.417 --> 21:39.750
I don't get it, and

21:39.833 --> 21:41.917
no, I don't recognize you,
I'm sorry. Should I?

21:42.333 --> 21:43.375
Are you kidding?

21:44.125 --> 21:45.833
Oh, you must not
follow football, then.

21:46.458 --> 21:49.167
Oh my god, are you two
both footballers?

21:49.208 --> 21:52.042
See, I told you this is
where all the boys come.

21:52.083 --> 21:54.125
Yeah, I'm a footballer.
Just signed East Stratford.

21:54.417 --> 21:56.708
-I'm a London Knight.
-That means nothing to me.

21:56.750 --> 21:58.583
-Umm, what about him?
-Oh, Adam?

21:59.625 --> 22:01.500
What is it this week,
mate? Truck driver?

22:03.667 --> 22:04.958
Yeah, until I get signed.

22:06.083 --> 22:07.875
So can we offer you girls
something to drink?

22:08.083 --> 22:10.208
-Perhaps some prosecco?
-Yes, please.

22:10.417 --> 22:11.875
Umm, I'm not sure.

22:12.167 --> 22:14.458
Umm, prosecco and champagne
usually go straight to my head

22:14.542 --> 22:16.208
-and I act really silly.
-Sounds perfect.

22:16.542 --> 22:19.125
We'll take a chilled prosecco
and five glasses, please.

22:19.208 --> 22:21.708
You are naughty... Do you
never take no for an answer?

22:21.792 --> 22:23.333
I guess not. Thank you.

22:24.167 --> 22:25.542
Well, at least
you're not French.

22:26.583 --> 22:29.167
-Wait, why?
-Well, we used to go
to this other club.

22:29.542 --> 22:31.000
Churchill's. Do you know it?

22:31.250 --> 22:32.917
Yeah, heard of it.
Not been there before.

22:33.125 --> 22:35.208
-Heard it's a bit...
-And as you were saying?

22:35.375 --> 22:37.500
This local football club's
players started coming in.

22:37.583 --> 22:39.375
The biggest wanker
of the lot was French.

22:39.583 --> 22:40.667
He was called Marcel.

22:40.750 --> 22:42.208
And he would go
around the whole club

22:42.292 --> 22:44.000
flirting with every
single woman in sight.

22:44.167 --> 22:45.500
Turns out he had a girlfriend.

22:45.583 --> 22:47.750
Crystal. She's a total bitch.

22:48.708 --> 22:52.375
Wait. You two guys haven't
got a little wife at home

22:52.458 --> 22:54.042
-have you?
-No.

22:54.458 --> 22:55.458
Girls.

22:55.542 --> 22:57.625
I think you might have
actually found two gentlemen.

22:59.000 --> 23:02.042
[slow music]

23:06.625 --> 23:07.667
[car door opens]

23:10.375 --> 23:11.458
[car door shuts]

23:15.750 --> 23:16.917
[knocking on door]

23:17.917 --> 23:18.917
I'll get that.

23:19.458 --> 23:21.125
Get you something
to drink while I'm up?

23:21.750 --> 23:23.792
Oh yeah, I'd love a cup of tea.

23:25.250 --> 23:28.208
Well, if the kettle's on,
I'll have a cup of tea, love.

23:29.750 --> 23:30.875
Of course. I won't be long.

23:31.333 --> 23:32.625
Excuse me, darling.

23:39.375 --> 23:41.542
[cellphone rings]

23:43.667 --> 23:44.667
[cellphone rings]

23:46.042 --> 23:48.375
-Hello?
-Chris. Oh my, oh my--

23:48.583 --> 23:50.125
Best night ever.

23:50.375 --> 23:51.458
[banging on door]

23:51.667 --> 23:52.875
I'm coming. Hold on!

23:53.000 --> 23:54.542
You'll have to
fill me in later, mate.

23:54.917 --> 23:56.625
You saw the girls home
safely though, yeah?

23:56.708 --> 23:58.417
I promise, man.
Let me put it this way.

23:58.542 --> 24:00.542
I made sure they got
a good night's sleep.

24:00.708 --> 24:02.208
Oh, have you no shame, mate?

24:02.708 --> 24:04.500
Whatever happened to
not kissing and telling?

24:05.083 --> 24:06.083
So which one?

24:06.292 --> 24:07.875
Not one. Both!

24:08.167 --> 24:10.625
Oh my god. You
are such a slapper.

24:10.708 --> 24:13.333
You know they only
slept with you to get
to me, though, don't you?

24:13.375 --> 24:15.292
-You're jealous.
-Open the door.

24:15.458 --> 24:16.583
[banging on door]
Open up!

24:16.667 --> 24:17.833
Sorry, mate, I've got to go.

24:24.292 --> 24:25.292
[opens door]

24:25.708 --> 24:26.917
Hello Chopra!

24:27.125 --> 24:28.417
Told you we'll be back.

24:28.500 --> 24:29.958
-Oh come on.
-Have you got the money?

24:30.042 --> 24:31.292
Oh come on guys.
I'll get the money, I promise.

24:31.375 --> 24:33.958
No, no, you've had enough time.
Give it to me.

24:34.125 --> 24:35.917
Please, not today.
Any day but today. Please.

24:36.417 --> 24:37.833
Get out of the way. Let's see.

24:40.958 --> 24:42.000
Morning, ladies.

24:43.542 --> 24:45.500
-Well.
-Oh my god.

24:47.250 --> 24:49.125
is this seriously happening?

24:49.417 --> 24:51.500
Oh, we won't hold you up
too long. You got that?

24:51.750 --> 24:52.917
Nice one. I'll get the van.

24:54.208 --> 24:56.500
[commentator]
Huge anticipation
at the Castle today.

24:56.708 --> 24:58.625
Right at the start
of a new season.

24:58.833 --> 25:00.667
And a new-look team
for East Stratford.

25:01.125 --> 25:03.375
Fans are divided,
but eager to find out

25:03.458 --> 25:04.750
what exactly that means.

25:04.917 --> 25:07.625
By having Chris Rose
and Marcel Remi

25:07.667 --> 25:08.792
in the same team.

25:08.917 --> 25:11.333
It's a decision the
chairman is standing by

25:11.708 --> 25:13.792
saying fortune favors the bold.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.208
So we'll have to wait and see

25:15.625 --> 25:16.917
what happens later today.

25:17.000 --> 25:20.083
[exciting music]

25:22.625 --> 25:25.083
There's not really much else
I can add to that, to be honest

25:25.667 --> 25:27.833
other than I really believe
that we can win this game.

25:28.458 --> 25:30.000
As long as we stick
to the game plan

25:30.833 --> 25:32.125
and you all know your roles

25:32.792 --> 25:34.125
we can come out victorious.

25:35.292 --> 25:36.500
Look, when we wear this shirt

25:37.042 --> 25:38.042
we're a team.

25:38.792 --> 25:40.708
When we're out on that pitch
we're the Knights.

25:42.417 --> 25:44.708
Let's leave our personal issues
in the locker room today.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.125
Let's get out there and do
what we're supposed to do.

25:47.583 --> 25:49.333
Are you with me, lads?
[enthusiastic cheers]

25:49.417 --> 25:52.417
[exciting music]

25:57.750 --> 25:59.417
When I get the opportunity
to score today

25:59.458 --> 26:01.458
regardless of the game plan
I'm going to take it.

26:01.500 --> 26:03.792
I'm going to be the best forward
this team has ever seen.

26:04.625 --> 26:06.458
[bangs table]
What the hell
happened out there?

26:06.792 --> 26:09.042
-I'm sorry.
-That was a rhetorical
question, Rose.

26:09.708 --> 26:10.792
What was it I said?

26:11.292 --> 26:13.917
Worst debut game in
the history of the club.

26:14.542 --> 26:16.667
You know, I would have
argued with them, but I can't.

26:17.333 --> 26:18.708
When I was offered you two...

26:19.167 --> 26:20.167
Yeah.

26:20.250 --> 26:21.875
I thought you might
be a bit volatile

26:22.708 --> 26:24.958
but I also thought
you'd energize the club.

26:25.292 --> 26:27.667
And somehow come together
and work in harmony out there.

26:28.167 --> 26:29.917
What I saw on the pitch
was anything but.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
But Marcel doesn't want
to play as part of a team.

26:32.042 --> 26:33.208
That's exactly what he said.

26:34.167 --> 26:35.833
Listen, you two need to grow up.

26:36.292 --> 26:39.333
-This is the Premiership!
-So you don't think in any way
this is your fault?

26:39.458 --> 26:42.042
That you should have
told me Marcel was
also signing to the club.

26:42.083 --> 26:43.500
That I got half the deal he got.

26:43.708 --> 26:45.250
Perhaps that I got a fair deal.

26:45.708 --> 26:47.208
That's it. Right, right.

26:48.042 --> 26:49.250
You didn't play well

26:49.625 --> 26:51.000
because I'm not
paying you enough.

26:51.958 --> 26:54.125
You and your agent,
you had the chance to haggle.

26:55.042 --> 26:56.583
You did a deal when you signed.

26:57.625 --> 26:59.250
And as for making decisions

26:59.625 --> 27:00.750
I'm the chairman!

27:01.583 --> 27:03.917
I've never run a decision
past any other player.

27:04.042 --> 27:06.208
And I'm certainly not
about to start with you!

27:08.208 --> 27:09.208
Now

27:09.792 --> 27:12.250
let me lay this out
as clear as I can spell it out.

27:14.125 --> 27:15.167
You and Marcel

27:15.708 --> 27:17.250
settle out your differences

27:18.000 --> 27:19.708
and start scoring goals

27:20.458 --> 27:22.542
or people are going
to be leaving the club.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.333
And no matter what the press say

27:24.792 --> 27:25.792
it won't be me.

27:25.958 --> 27:26.958
Well?

27:27.083 --> 27:29.083
-Was it as bad as you feared?
-It was worse, mate.

27:29.167 --> 27:31.083
You were pretty shit
out there, mate.

27:31.167 --> 27:34.000
You are such a tosser. Remind me
again why we're friends.

27:34.083 --> 27:35.875
Chris, you and I are
in a similar boat, mate.

27:36.083 --> 27:37.875
I think I have an idea
how we can sort this.

27:38.042 --> 27:39.833
-Same boat, how?
-Don't worry about that.

27:40.042 --> 27:42.000
-Do you know Greens in Camden?
-Yeah, I think so.

27:42.083 --> 27:44.500
Well, let's go there. I need
a drink, and you're paying.

27:46.125 --> 27:48.708
I'll tell you, mate, you don't
realize it but with
the spectators

27:48.792 --> 27:49.833
it's the funniest thing you've
ever seen.

27:51.292 --> 27:52.542
One minute you're hurtling down
the wing,

27:52.958 --> 27:54.625
Next minute, Marcel tackles you

27:55.000 --> 27:58.000
-and you land flat on the pitch.
-What sort of idiot
tackles his own player

27:58.042 --> 27:59.042
and doesn't score?

28:00.083 --> 28:01.875
-What was he thinking?
-Exactly.

28:02.125 --> 28:03.583
You know what
pisses me off the most?

28:03.708 --> 28:06.500
Is that the ref, the club,
the team, the players

28:06.833 --> 28:08.125
they all think it was my fault.

28:08.375 --> 28:10.708
Even my mom called me to give
me a go for being a hothead.

28:11.042 --> 28:12.417
And that's why
I brought you here.

28:13.167 --> 28:15.125
But first, a bit of
an admission, mate.

28:15.750 --> 28:17.750
I'm broke. A lot of people

28:18.125 --> 28:19.792
-a lot of money--
-What's new, Adam?

28:19.875 --> 28:22.417
For as long as I've known you,
you've not a penny to your name.

28:22.458 --> 28:24.833
This is different. For the last
few years I've been playing

28:24.917 --> 28:26.417
a lot of poker,
trying to fix my debt.

28:26.500 --> 28:28.250
-But it's made it much worse.
-Shock me.

28:29.208 --> 28:31.333
-How much?
-Not sure, really.

28:32.875 --> 28:35.250
I'm past the point of counting
and into the point of

28:35.500 --> 28:37.208
asking casino owners
if I can work it off.

28:37.417 --> 28:38.958
I was even paying
at Danny's club.

28:39.125 --> 28:40.167
We don't even like Danny.

28:40.333 --> 28:41.833
It doesn't matter,
he's dead anyway.

28:42.042 --> 28:44.792
-Shot by some rival club
owner or something like that.
-Jesus.

28:45.667 --> 28:48.292
-So what do you want me
to do? Pay it back?
-Sort of.

28:49.917 --> 28:50.917
Like I said

28:51.417 --> 28:52.708
I need to work it off and

28:52.958 --> 28:54.292
when they found out I knew you

28:54.958 --> 28:57.125
-they want me to introduce you.
-Adam, no fucking way.

28:57.625 --> 28:59.042
I'm happy to
help you pay it back

28:59.125 --> 29:01.125
but I'm not gonna get
involved with anybody dodgy.

29:01.167 --> 29:03.167
-You say that, but--
-No, Adam, that's it. Final.

29:03.417 --> 29:05.208
It's probably too late
for that mate, sorry.

29:05.458 --> 29:07.042
-What do you mean?
-This bar

29:07.792 --> 29:08.958
is one of the places I play.

29:09.083 --> 29:11.042
The owner's this guy
I need you to meet.

29:12.083 --> 29:13.583
Adam, you fucking idiot.

29:13.667 --> 29:15.333
You said it yourself...

29:15.875 --> 29:18.292
-Need some more friends, anyway.
-Yeah, maybe new friends

29:18.583 --> 29:21.458
but not people with access to
concrete shoes and shotguns

29:21.542 --> 29:24.417
that kill other bar owners
because they don't like
how they do business.

29:24.458 --> 29:26.542
What made you think I'd
be interested in this, mate?

29:26.625 --> 29:28.792
I thought they might have
helped get even with Marcel.

29:29.542 --> 29:30.542
Hello, Adam.

29:31.250 --> 29:32.625
I see you brought your friend.

29:32.958 --> 29:33.958
As promised.

29:34.042 --> 29:37.083
[tense music]

29:37.917 --> 29:39.583
Welcome to Greens, Mr. Rose.

29:40.000 --> 29:41.000
I'm Alexei.

29:42.167 --> 29:43.292
Can I get you another drink?

29:43.417 --> 29:45.542
No, thank you. I'm in
training at the moment.

29:46.167 --> 29:48.042
-Honest, I was just about to go.
-I see.

29:48.667 --> 29:51.708
Well, it was an honor
to have such a famous
footballer in my bar anyway.

29:51.750 --> 29:53.667
Can I get a picture of
the three of us together?

29:53.792 --> 29:55.000
I can hang it above the bar.

29:55.458 --> 29:57.750
The day the great
Chris Rose came to Greens.

29:58.375 --> 30:00.417
-Yeah, of course.
-Viktor, have you
got your camera?

30:00.500 --> 30:01.667
We need a selfie moment.

30:09.250 --> 30:11.500
[camera shutter]
Excellent.
Let me see, let me see.

30:12.458 --> 30:14.500
Amazing. Get it printed, Viktor.

30:15.208 --> 30:17.500
I want everyone to know
I'm friends with Chris Rose.

30:17.542 --> 30:18.542
Da, boss.

30:18.667 --> 30:21.292
Isn't it amazing, how
mobile phones these days can do

30:21.792 --> 30:23.250
so much more than make calls?

30:23.875 --> 30:24.875
A bit like you, Chris.

30:25.917 --> 30:27.958
Everyone knows you
as just a footballer

30:28.417 --> 30:30.542
but I bet you are
so much more, aren't you?

30:30.708 --> 30:32.333
-I guess.
-Oh, don't be so modest

30:33.208 --> 30:35.833
I've seen you play. You have
some serious talent, my friend.

30:36.083 --> 30:38.875
-Thank you.
-See, and humble too.

30:40.083 --> 30:42.250
Adam here tells me you're
not enjoying your move

30:42.333 --> 30:44.167
to East Stratford.
Is that correct?

30:45.167 --> 30:46.250
Oh he did, did he?

30:47.000 --> 30:49.417
No, it's probably just some
new club teething problems.

30:49.792 --> 30:52.250
What if I could offer you a
solution to all your problems?

30:52.458 --> 30:54.125
And help your friend
here in the process?

30:54.875 --> 30:55.958
Would you be interested?

30:56.542 --> 30:57.542
I'm not sure.

30:58.083 --> 30:59.667
Really, I'm just
a footballer, you know?

30:59.708 --> 31:01.708
-I mean, what you
see is what you get.
-Perhaps.

31:02.792 --> 31:04.583
But if you do this
one little thing for me.

31:05.500 --> 31:07.833
We can offer you
so much more in return.

31:08.417 --> 31:09.417
[fingers clap]

31:15.750 --> 31:18.833
Inside is enough money
for your friend to pay off
all his other debts.

31:21.542 --> 31:22.625
OK, let's be honest.

31:23.458 --> 31:24.583
What is it you want from me?

31:25.042 --> 31:26.750
Next week's game
against Clutchworth.

31:27.708 --> 31:29.625
I want you to do
everything you can do to lose.

31:29.708 --> 31:32.750
[tense music]

31:37.708 --> 31:38.708
So, Dad.

31:40.333 --> 31:42.958
They've given me this phone.
24 hours to make a decision.

31:44.792 --> 31:47.458
If I'm in, I just text them and
all of Adam's problems go away.

31:49.458 --> 31:50.458
And as for me

31:51.333 --> 31:53.958
they agree to make up
the contract difference
between Marcel and I.

31:56.375 --> 31:58.292
All I've got to do is throw
the odd game or two.

32:00.583 --> 32:02.792
I know it's not
the East Stratford
start we wanted, but

32:03.458 --> 32:05.833
nothing by joining the Knights
has been what I anticipated.

32:06.583 --> 32:07.583
[sniffs]

32:08.792 --> 32:10.542
I really want to get
my own back on him too

32:11.000 --> 32:12.042
especially Marcel.

32:12.750 --> 32:13.875
And what's throwing a game?

32:14.167 --> 32:15.417
Will it really, really matter?

32:20.917 --> 32:21.917
Anyway, Dad.

32:23.500 --> 32:24.583
I've got to go now.

32:26.583 --> 32:27.625
Thanks for the talk, Dad.

32:29.250 --> 32:32.292
[quiet music]

32:34.292 --> 32:37.333
[upbeat European music]

32:48.500 --> 32:50.250
So, Chris, have you
made your decision yet?

32:51.042 --> 32:52.458
Absolutely. I think
I want to have

32:52.500 --> 32:54.458
the oysters, followed
by the steak, please.

32:54.583 --> 32:55.583
Oysters, hey?

32:55.958 --> 32:58.958
-So I'm gonna go for the smoked
salmon and the chicken, please.
-Thank you.

33:00.375 --> 33:04.167
You know, I don't usually
drink this much with guys.

33:04.708 --> 33:06.458
-I know.
-Especially on dates.

33:06.542 --> 33:08.750
I remember you told me
it goes straight to your head.

33:08.792 --> 33:10.542
I think that's why
I keep pouring you more.

33:11.042 --> 33:12.500
But, umm, why here?

33:13.167 --> 33:15.333
When you're a footballer,
anything's possible.

33:16.375 --> 33:17.708
I just wanted to do it in style.

33:17.958 --> 33:20.000
You mean...
you just want to show off.

33:20.250 --> 33:21.583
Maybe, but, umm

33:22.375 --> 33:24.750
let's just enjoy the most
romantic date possible.

33:25.417 --> 33:26.417
[glasses clink]

33:26.708 --> 33:28.042
Voila, madame, monsieur.

33:28.750 --> 33:31.583
-Thank you.
-So anyway, Chris, you were
going to ask me something.

33:32.625 --> 33:34.625
-I've got this friend--
-Is this about Adam again?

33:34.708 --> 33:37.083
I told you my friends are
so embarrassed about that.

33:37.417 --> 33:38.542
I mean, imagine being there

33:38.875 --> 33:40.375
when all your stuff
gets repossessed.

33:40.417 --> 33:42.875
Wait, did you just say that he
had all his stuff repossessed?

33:42.958 --> 33:44.083
Yeah, they took everything.

33:44.167 --> 33:46.042
His kitchen appliances,
his furniture.

33:46.083 --> 33:47.750
And all that was left
like a few clothes.

33:47.792 --> 33:49.125
I didn't realize
it was that bad.

33:50.083 --> 33:52.167
I just thought he got
caught with his pants down.

33:52.708 --> 33:54.458
No, it wasn't about him.

33:55.542 --> 33:57.250
It was about another
friend I have at work.

33:58.792 --> 33:59.792
Let's just say

34:00.333 --> 34:01.417
he's getting bullied.

34:01.792 --> 34:04.042
See, I hate bullies.
It's all about the power.

34:04.583 --> 34:05.583
Yeah, well

34:06.167 --> 34:07.750
he has an opportunity
to get one back.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.458
It's slightly unorthodox and

34:13.542 --> 34:15.667
-maybe slightly illegal.
-Is anybody gonna get hurt?

34:15.708 --> 34:18.250
-No, not really.
-Then, if you've
got the opportunity

34:18.333 --> 34:20.958
to, you know, get
one over on a bully, then

34:21.042 --> 34:23.792
-I'd say go for it.
-Even if it's, like I said

34:24.542 --> 34:26.458
-illegal.
-The way I see it

34:27.042 --> 34:29.000
no one's gonna get hurt,
then what's the problem?

34:30.375 --> 34:32.292
Ashley, can you excuse me
to go to the bathroom?

34:32.375 --> 34:34.708
Sure, but don't run out on me
and jumping out any windows.

34:34.792 --> 34:37.667
On you? I'm sure
that's never happened.
[Ashley laughs]

34:41.542 --> 34:44.542

[kicks wall]

35:00.000 --> 35:03.083
[music continues]

35:13.750 --> 35:14.750
For Adam.

35:15.750 --> 35:17.333
[cellphone message tone]

35:25.333 --> 35:26.458
[cellphone rings]

[cellphone rings]

35:31.500 --> 35:32.625
[cellphone rings]

35:37.042 --> 35:38.042
Demetri.

35:38.292 --> 35:39.375
The footballer is in.

35:41.292 --> 35:44.333
[slow romantic music builds]

[announcer]
After East Stratford's
last performance

37:50.375 --> 37:52.417
the crowd is left
a little deflated

37:52.458 --> 37:54.500
in the knowledge
that Marcel and Chris

37:54.833 --> 37:57.417
are both in the
starting eleven again.

37:57.833 --> 38:00.083
Why chairman Gower
and manager Chapman

38:00.125 --> 38:03.042
persist on playing these two
together on the field of play

38:03.333 --> 38:05.875
[announcer in background]
Next was the game
against Clutchworth.

38:06.542 --> 38:08.583
I want you to do
everything you can to lose.

38:08.708 --> 38:11.000
[Ashley]
No one's gonna get hurt,
then what's the problem?

38:11.083 --> 38:14.083
[tense music]

38:22.500 --> 38:23.542
Don't worry, Englishman.

38:23.792 --> 38:25.917
Even you can't play as
badly as you did last time.

38:25.958 --> 38:27.375
Mr. Rose, you have guests.

38:34.750 --> 38:36.083
Guys, what are you doing here?

38:36.208 --> 38:38.292
Well, Adam called me
last night and suggested

38:38.333 --> 38:39.875
I lose my, how did you put it?

38:40.042 --> 38:42.000
-Football virginity?
-Oh he did, did he?

38:42.042 --> 38:44.625
Yeah, seeing as she's
such a good influence
on you these days

38:44.708 --> 38:47.250
maybe she would be a
good luck charm in today's game.

38:47.333 --> 38:48.625
Oh, well.
[they kiss]

38:48.792 --> 38:50.583
Thank you for coming,
hope you guys enjoy it.

38:50.667 --> 38:53.125
Excuse me, mate, will you take
my girlfriend and my best mate

38:53.167 --> 38:55.167
-to the Director's box,
please? Thank you.
-Yes.

38:57.917 --> 39:00.292
Adam, mate, what the hell
do you think you're doing?

39:01.583 --> 39:04.000
Wish you good luck, I thought
to calm you down a little bit.

39:04.292 --> 39:05.292
Calm me down?

39:05.542 --> 39:06.833
Now I'm more nervous than ever.

39:07.042 --> 39:09.417
Believe it or not, this is my
first time throwing a game.

39:09.542 --> 39:11.250
And you've brought
her here to witness it?

39:11.333 --> 39:13.708
Sorry man, I didn't think.
Gotta go, all right?

39:18.667 --> 39:20.583
[announcer] Well, the
teams are due out shortly.

39:20.667 --> 39:22.625
We've got time to
hear from Chris Kamara

39:22.875 --> 39:25.333
on his thoughts
about today's game.

39:27.042 --> 39:29.000
[Chris Kamara] After last
week's shambles of a game

39:29.042 --> 39:30.375
it's a surprise to all

39:30.542 --> 39:32.042
that East Stratford's management

39:32.250 --> 39:35.667
is playing Rose and Remi
up front again together

39:36.000 --> 39:37.375
let alone in
the starting lineup.

39:38.250 --> 39:39.875
You have to give it
to the Knights fans.

39:40.375 --> 39:42.667
The dedication to
their team is unrivaled.

39:43.042 --> 39:44.042
If nothing else

39:44.208 --> 39:46.375
their enthusiasm to see
their beloved team

39:46.417 --> 39:47.417
come through triumphant

39:47.667 --> 39:50.125
might be all that's required
to make Chris Rose

39:50.417 --> 39:51.583
and Marcel Remi

39:51.833 --> 39:52.917
play well together.

39:53.208 --> 39:55.583
No one knows how this team
will fare against Clutchworth.

39:55.875 --> 39:57.833
The only thing we
can say for sure

39:58.042 --> 39:59.667
is that this match
won't be boring

40:00.000 --> 40:01.708
and it's bound
to be full of drama.

40:02.167 --> 40:03.542
Don't get in
my way again, Rose-y.

40:03.625 --> 40:05.292
especially when I'm
going to score, ca Va?

40:05.375 --> 40:07.792
[announcer] However,
the reality is that if this team

40:07.833 --> 40:10.500
doesn't pull together,
one, or both

40:10.875 --> 40:12.292
will be surely let go.

40:12.958 --> 40:14.042
I have to say, though

40:14.208 --> 40:16.542
and it's probably for
all the wrong reasons

40:17.042 --> 40:19.333
but I have never been
this excited to see

40:19.375 --> 40:22.083
what will happen in a game
so early in a season.

40:22.167 --> 40:24.250
[crowd cheering]

40:24.333 --> 40:26.708
[announcer] Thanks, Chris.
East Stratford to kick off

40:27.208 --> 40:29.250
and it will be Rose and Remi

40:29.417 --> 40:31.500
at the start getting
the ball rolling.

40:32.083 --> 40:33.708
And for those of you
watching at home

40:33.958 --> 40:35.833
it is a harsh atmosphere here.

40:36.125 --> 40:38.542
Rose and Remi must
surely be feeling

40:38.792 --> 40:41.458
uncomfortable with the reception
that they're getting.

40:41.500 --> 40:44.542
[upbeat song]

40:45.750 --> 40:47.958
Rose just not getting
into the match at all.

40:48.333 --> 40:51.125
He really isn't playing where
we expected him to play.

40:51.167 --> 40:53.333
But where I think the manager
expected him to play

40:53.375 --> 40:54.500
that's a surprise.

40:55.000 --> 40:56.292
And a chance for Clutchworth.

40:56.667 --> 40:58.292
They are looking the
more dangerous side.

40:58.375 --> 40:59.500
They could have scored then.

41:00.167 --> 41:03.667
His teammates want more
from Chris Rose, a lot more.

41:03.750 --> 41:06.750
[upbeat song continues]

41:28.667 --> 41:31.083
[song fades away]

41:31.167 --> 41:32.583
Well, this might be
the last chance.

41:35.292 --> 41:36.750
Well, the free kick's
been given.

41:37.292 --> 41:38.958
It's one last chance here

41:39.750 --> 41:42.208
to put the ball into the
Clutchworth penalty area.

41:42.417 --> 41:43.500
Taken by Colton.

41:44.625 --> 41:45.625
Goal!

41:45.708 --> 41:47.667
[loud cheers]
It's Rose!

41:48.500 --> 41:49.958
Oh my word!
[loud cheers continue]

41:50.667 --> 41:52.792
He's done nothing for 90 minutes

41:52.958 --> 41:54.667
and here in injury time

41:54.917 --> 41:56.333
[speaking in Russian]

41:56.375 --> 41:59.083

42:15.917 --> 42:16.917
Bring him in.

42:50.667 --> 42:53.625

43:09.625 --> 43:12.708
Karina and Feddick
had a chat with Joe.

43:13.208 --> 43:14.375
They got nowhere.

43:15.375 --> 43:16.375
However

43:16.875 --> 43:19.292
Viktor and the boys put
together this list.

43:20.417 --> 43:22.833
It has all their
businesses on it.

43:23.292 --> 43:24.292
Excellent.

43:24.375 --> 43:26.000
You have done very well.

43:26.417 --> 43:28.542
-Leave the list on the desk.
-Boss.

43:29.167 --> 43:31.625
-Looks like our guest is awake.
-Good.

43:33.583 --> 43:35.250
Alexei, you see to the girl.

43:35.667 --> 43:37.958
I'll have a chat
with our friend here.

43:48.917 --> 43:49.917
Hello, Chris.

43:51.458 --> 43:53.375
Now, you don't know me

43:53.792 --> 43:55.042
and that is a

43:55.917 --> 43:56.917
remiss of me.

43:59.000 --> 44:00.250
My name is Demetri.

44:02.417 --> 44:03.417
And you

44:04.375 --> 44:05.375
work for me.

44:06.417 --> 44:07.417
Where's Ashley?

44:07.667 --> 44:08.708
The girl?

44:08.833 --> 44:09.833
Who is she?

44:09.917 --> 44:12.500
Nobody. I just met her tonight.
She has nothing to do with this.

44:15.125 --> 44:16.250
She will be fine.

44:21.083 --> 44:22.542
Don't worry about her.

44:37.542 --> 44:38.542
I would

44:38.792 --> 44:40.333
offer you one, but...

44:41.292 --> 44:43.500
How do I know what you say to me

44:43.542 --> 44:45.875
-is what you really want?
-Oh, the game.

44:46.625 --> 44:48.833
I'm sorry I broke my promise.
I'm sorry about the game.

44:49.708 --> 44:51.958
Do you know what I like
about vodka, Chris?

44:53.500 --> 44:55.792
Its simplicity in purest form.

44:57.333 --> 44:58.458
I don't understand.

44:58.667 --> 44:59.708
It is very cool.

45:00.667 --> 45:01.667
Vodka is

45:02.167 --> 45:03.167
simple.

45:03.208 --> 45:05.208
Look at how clean
and fresh it looks.

45:06.917 --> 45:07.917
No color.

45:09.250 --> 45:10.458
No cloudiness.

45:12.458 --> 45:13.458
Just pure.

45:17.542 --> 45:19.333
But, with a bite.

45:22.792 --> 45:26.000
Do you know etymology
of word "vodka"?

45:26.417 --> 45:27.417
Chris.

45:28.458 --> 45:29.792
No. No, no, I'm sorry.

45:30.292 --> 45:31.292
It's OK.

45:33.208 --> 45:34.208
Not many do.

45:36.292 --> 45:38.375
Comes from Slavic word for

45:39.000 --> 45:40.000
water.

45:40.667 --> 45:41.667
Volta.

45:43.333 --> 45:44.542
So you see, Chris.

45:46.458 --> 45:48.542
Even its name is simple.

45:50.542 --> 45:51.542
After all

45:53.417 --> 45:55.542
you can't get anything
more pure than

45:56.500 --> 45:57.500
water.

45:59.667 --> 46:00.667
Then.

46:01.958 --> 46:03.542
Then we have the

46:03.750 --> 46:04.750
business

46:06.250 --> 46:07.250
of vodka.

46:07.333 --> 46:08.333
You take a

46:08.625 --> 46:10.000
take a peasant's food

46:11.458 --> 46:12.458
the potato

46:13.792 --> 46:14.917
and we distill it

46:16.000 --> 46:17.250
until it makes this

46:18.167 --> 46:19.167
this pure

46:19.542 --> 46:21.875
simple liquid that we sell for

46:22.750 --> 46:25.125
hundred times original value.

46:26.792 --> 46:28.667
So do you understand, Chris

46:30.375 --> 46:31.875
why men like me

46:33.833 --> 46:35.625
appreciate vodka?

46:36.583 --> 46:37.583
Well

46:37.833 --> 46:39.750
I, I think so, I think so, yeah.

46:43.417 --> 46:46.208
Why did you think
it was smart idea to

46:48.083 --> 46:49.167
complicate things?

46:49.917 --> 46:52.042
I'm sorry. It was,
it was an accident.

46:52.250 --> 46:53.333
[Demetri laughs]

46:55.375 --> 46:56.375
You

46:56.542 --> 46:59.000
you accidentally scored a goal?

46:59.375 --> 47:00.375
[laughs]

47:02.583 --> 47:03.583
That is a

47:05.583 --> 47:06.750
that is good one.

47:09.167 --> 47:12.250
[pours out vodka]

47:20.292 --> 47:22.208
-I don't fucking believe you.
-It's true.

47:22.875 --> 47:23.875
I mean, it was like

47:23.958 --> 47:26.125
it was like muscle memory.
The ball just came across--

47:26.167 --> 47:27.583
Shut the fuck up!

47:28.917 --> 47:30.292
We had a deal.

47:30.833 --> 47:33.833
A simple, straightforward
fucking deal!

47:35.125 --> 47:38.542
All you had to do was to make
sure that East Stratford lost.

47:38.792 --> 47:41.250
Instead of that, because of you

47:42.333 --> 47:43.333
they won.

47:43.417 --> 47:45.958
And I lost a lot of money.

47:46.458 --> 47:47.458
Nothing

47:47.500 --> 47:48.500
about that

47:48.792 --> 47:51.083
-is fucking simple.
-I'll get you the money back.

47:52.250 --> 47:53.333
I can throw another game.

47:54.667 --> 47:55.875
I'm a Premiership footballer.

47:56.208 --> 47:58.542
I have fifty grand in the bank,
I make five grand a week.

47:58.708 --> 47:59.708
I can pay you back.

48:04.792 --> 48:05.958
I like you, Chris.

48:07.167 --> 48:08.625
You are a very funny man.

48:10.375 --> 48:13.917
When I knew what the outcome of
Saturday's game was going to be

48:15.875 --> 48:17.208
on Friday night

48:18.458 --> 48:20.125
I and my comrades

48:21.167 --> 48:22.875
gambled a lot of money.

48:24.792 --> 48:27.042
We lost fucking millions.

48:27.292 --> 48:29.000
-I can throw another game.
-No.

48:30.375 --> 48:32.042
To do that again would be

48:33.417 --> 48:34.417
too messy.

48:35.542 --> 48:37.333
Not simple, remember?

48:37.917 --> 48:40.292
-I like simple.
-Oh, there must be
something I can do.

48:40.625 --> 48:42.917
I'm sure I can get your money
back. I'm sure I can do it.

48:43.000 --> 48:44.000
I have a

48:44.250 --> 48:46.917
professional responsibility
to show the world

48:47.750 --> 48:48.750
what happens

48:49.333 --> 48:51.375
if you go back
on a deal with me.

48:52.250 --> 48:55.292
I can't have people thinking
that I have gone soft now,
Chris, can I?

48:55.375 --> 48:57.333
I guess, I guess, I guess,
but I'm begging you.

48:57.625 --> 48:59.250
I promise you there's
something I can do.

48:59.417 --> 49:01.000
Just let me go and
I can sort this out.

49:02.333 --> 49:04.000
But the alternative is to

49:05.083 --> 49:06.083
kill you.

49:07.458 --> 49:08.708
And killing you is

49:10.625 --> 49:12.667
[sighs]
is messy.

49:13.750 --> 49:15.125
Certainly not simple.

49:18.917 --> 49:19.917
Let us say...

49:21.875 --> 49:23.458
Let us say, I give you

49:24.250 --> 49:25.250
four weeks

49:26.375 --> 49:28.042
to get me two million pounds.

49:30.208 --> 49:33.083
-Do you think you
could do that, Chris?
-I'm sure I can, I'm sure of it.

49:34.208 --> 49:35.208
And you

49:35.292 --> 49:37.292
wouldn't do anything stupid like

49:37.958 --> 49:39.625
-going to the police?
-Of course not.

49:44.208 --> 49:45.208
OK.

49:47.333 --> 49:48.333
OK.

49:50.708 --> 49:52.917
For the first time in
my professional career

49:54.542 --> 49:56.458
I am going to give
second chance.

49:58.542 --> 50:00.917
You have four weeks to
get me two million pounds.

50:01.042 --> 50:02.042
However

50:02.958 --> 50:04.250
if you go to the police

50:05.417 --> 50:06.417
or you don't manage it

50:08.375 --> 50:09.792
then I am taking what you love.

50:11.250 --> 50:12.250
Your family

50:14.667 --> 50:15.792
and your fucking legs

50:17.625 --> 50:18.625
because

50:18.667 --> 50:19.792
believe me, my friend

50:21.042 --> 50:23.042
when we have finished with you

50:25.083 --> 50:27.458
you won't be fucking needing
either of them anyway

50:31.042 --> 50:32.042
Viktor!

50:37.583 --> 50:39.250
Get him and the girl
out of here.

50:43.458 --> 50:46.500
[ominous music]

50:52.292 --> 50:53.875
Chris, what the hell
is going on?

50:53.958 --> 50:55.792
Nothing, babe. Tell you
in a minute. Let's go.

50:55.875 --> 50:57.333
What the hell
is going on, Chris?

50:57.417 --> 50:58.625
Ashley, let's just get a cab

50:58.667 --> 51:00.208
and I'll explain to you
on the way, OK?

51:00.292 --> 51:02.458
There's a phone box over there.
Let's call the police.

51:02.542 --> 51:04.042
No, we cannot get
the police involved.

51:04.083 --> 51:06.125
We were just kidnapped
and tied up in a warehouse!

51:06.167 --> 51:08.125
-You don't understand.
-So fucking explain then.

51:08.167 --> 51:10.583
Oh, it's a football thing. It's
like the new guy on the team

51:10.667 --> 51:13.500
-when he scores a goal
they play a trick.
-Like an initiation practice?

51:13.542 --> 51:15.833
Exactly, and that's why we
can't get the police involved.

51:15.917 --> 51:17.333
-You can't, but I can!
-Ashley.

51:18.208 --> 51:20.083
Football is everything to me.

51:20.667 --> 51:22.833
-If you can't understand that...
-What are you saying?

51:23.708 --> 51:26.042
I'm saying football's been a
part of me since I was a kid.

51:26.542 --> 51:27.708
Before I even met you.

51:28.083 --> 51:31.083
So, you, would choose
that lifestyle over me.

51:31.125 --> 51:32.833
[sad music]

51:32.917 --> 51:33.917
Ashley.

51:34.792 --> 51:35.833
If you're asking me

51:36.333 --> 51:37.333
to choose between you

51:38.042 --> 51:39.042
and football

51:39.167 --> 51:40.250
then I'm sorry, but...

51:40.542 --> 51:41.583
Fuck you, Chris!

51:41.667 --> 51:44.667
[sad music]

51:45.875 --> 51:47.083
At least you'll be safe.

51:50.750 --> 51:53.750
[dramatic music]

52:00.500 --> 52:02.375
[Adam] I'm broke.
A lot of people

52:02.833 --> 52:03.833
a lot of money.

52:04.042 --> 52:05.875
[Chris] Oh, there must
be something I can do.

52:06.042 --> 52:08.333
I'm sure I can get your money
back, I'm sure I can do it.

52:08.417 --> 52:10.542
[Alexei] I want you to do
everything you can to lose.

52:10.625 --> 52:12.958
[Ashley] No one's gonna get
hurt, then what's the problem?

52:13.000 --> 52:15.417
[Demetri] You have four weeks
to get the two million pounds.

52:15.500 --> 52:16.500
However

52:17.292 --> 52:18.667
if you go to the police

52:19.792 --> 52:20.833
or you don't manage it

52:21.583 --> 52:22.750
[upbeat music]

52:22.792 --> 52:24.042
then I'm taking what you love.

52:24.083 --> 52:25.583
[music continues]

52:25.667 --> 52:26.667
Your family

52:26.750 --> 52:28.917
[music continues]

52:28.958 --> 52:30.250
and your fucking legs.

52:30.292 --> 52:33.333
[music continues]

52:36.875 --> 52:37.875
What is it?

52:38.417 --> 52:39.417
Gambling debts?

52:39.875 --> 52:40.875
It's something like that.

52:41.625 --> 52:43.125
Sir, listen, if you
loan me this money

52:43.208 --> 52:44.750
I promise you it will
never happen again

52:44.833 --> 52:46.458
and I will work for free
for you forever.

52:46.542 --> 52:48.667
As attractive as an
opportunity as that sounds

52:49.458 --> 52:50.708
I simply don't have the money.

52:51.750 --> 52:52.750
Maybe you forget.

52:53.542 --> 52:55.625
I just spent my whole budget
on two top players.

52:56.208 --> 52:57.208
Well

52:57.458 --> 52:58.958
thank you for
considering my request.

52:59.083 --> 53:02.083
[dramatic music]

53:07.458 --> 53:08.833
Mr. Rose, thank you for coming.

53:09.208 --> 53:10.833
No problem at all,
you can call me Chris.

53:10.875 --> 53:11.875
Well, Chris.

53:11.958 --> 53:14.875
As I understand, you want
to close your current account,
is that correct?

53:14.917 --> 53:17.333
Yes, I'd like to get all of my
money out of my account today

53:17.417 --> 53:19.542
but I'd also like to get a loan
for as much as I can.

53:19.583 --> 53:21.375
I think he's starting
to get money together.

53:21.625 --> 53:23.042
He's at the bank now.

53:23.208 --> 53:25.667
[Demetri on phone]
Just make sure you
and Karina stay with him.

53:25.917 --> 53:28.125
I want to make sure
he doesn't go to the police.

53:28.167 --> 53:30.292
You have to understand.
My hands are somewhat tied

53:30.417 --> 53:32.583
without knowing what the
money's going to be used for.

53:32.833 --> 53:36.542
Your loan is based upon
things such as your house
and your job as security.

53:36.792 --> 53:38.583
Well, if that's everything
the bank can loan

53:38.625 --> 53:40.250
it will have to be enough,
so thank you.

53:40.292 --> 53:43.292
[dramatic music]

53:49.875 --> 53:52.083
Listen. Tell Demetri I'm
as good as my word.

53:52.292 --> 53:53.958
I've got 65 grand
coming tomorrow.

53:54.125 --> 53:56.125
I just need to know where
he wants it dropped off.

53:56.625 --> 53:59.625
Oh, and if you just
stop fucking following me,
this would be a lot quicker.

53:59.667 --> 54:02.750
[dramatic music builds]

54:04.833 --> 54:05.958
So, basically, mate

54:06.167 --> 54:08.125
I'm up shit creek,
and it's all your fault, Adam.

54:08.250 --> 54:10.250
I'm sorry Chris, I never
meant for this to happen.

54:10.333 --> 54:11.625
You should have
missed that goal.

54:12.000 --> 54:13.167
Oh really, you think?

54:13.958 --> 54:15.333
So how much did you
manage to get?

54:16.417 --> 54:17.875
In total, about 70k.

54:19.083 --> 54:20.375
But that's not nearly enough.

54:20.917 --> 54:23.000
What are you today, mate?
Professor Bloody Obvious?

54:23.083 --> 54:25.500
I'm sorry,
I thought you footballers
are meant to be loaded.

54:25.833 --> 54:28.750
Yeah, maybe asset-rich
but my image raise
hasn't kicked in yet.

54:29.833 --> 54:31.917
Besides, it seems
running illegal vodka rackets

54:32.000 --> 54:34.375
and threatening football lives
is a way more lucrative job.

54:35.083 --> 54:36.167
Who would have known, huh?

54:36.917 --> 54:38.000
Sorry, you've lost me.

54:38.458 --> 54:39.583
Don't worry about it, mate.

54:41.292 --> 54:42.542
Look, I've been everywhere.

54:42.583 --> 54:45.083
I've exhausted all options. We
need to try and get this money.

54:45.958 --> 54:47.875
So it looks like we've
only got one option left.

54:48.417 --> 54:49.750
And you're gonna
help me with it.

54:52.500 --> 54:54.833
You know what, sometimes I wish
I'd listened to my mother.

54:55.000 --> 54:56.875
She always said you
were a bad influence, mate.

54:57.458 --> 54:59.292
Maybe if I did we wouldn't
be here right now.

55:03.000 --> 55:04.167
Listen, mate, you ready?

55:09.042 --> 55:10.042
Let's go.

55:10.333 --> 55:13.333
[exciting music]

55:13.583 --> 55:15.458
Don't you fucking move,
don't you fucking move.

55:15.542 --> 55:16.542
[shotgun blast]

55:18.208 --> 55:19.458
Stay in the car, don't move.

55:19.500 --> 55:21.875
Go to the front of the van.
Stay in the fucking car.

55:23.167 --> 55:25.792
Don't you fucking move.
Don't you fucking move.

55:26.125 --> 55:27.292
Don't you fucking move.

55:27.500 --> 55:28.500
Let's go.

55:28.583 --> 55:31.583
[exciting music continues]

55:37.333 --> 55:39.083
[music fades away]

55:47.958 --> 55:48.958
So

55:49.833 --> 55:50.833
as promised

55:51.750 --> 55:53.917
you have returned
with your first

55:54.708 --> 55:55.708
down payment.

55:56.417 --> 55:57.417
Where's Chris?

55:57.458 --> 55:58.500
Don't worry about him.

55:59.917 --> 56:01.250
I wanted to talk to you alone.

56:02.792 --> 56:05.083
Must feel great to
have a friend who

56:05.750 --> 56:08.625
will do this much
for you and your safety.

56:11.667 --> 56:13.333
What the fuck is this?

56:14.083 --> 56:15.917
-Get Viktor in here.
-Yes, boss.

56:17.167 --> 56:18.667
-Viktor!
-What's wrong?

56:20.292 --> 56:23.583
Viktor. Get these boxes opened
and destroyed fucking quickly.

56:25.917 --> 56:26.917
Mmm.

56:28.167 --> 56:29.625
Are these the boxes
you've stolen?

56:29.833 --> 56:31.917
-Yes, why?
-Because

56:32.750 --> 56:33.875
these boxes

56:34.375 --> 56:37.042
have security devices
attached to them.

56:38.083 --> 56:39.458
Un-pickable locks.

56:39.750 --> 56:40.750
Smart water.

56:41.792 --> 56:43.625
And tracking devices.

56:43.708 --> 56:46.292
-I'm sorry, it was our
first ever security van heist.
-Clearly.

56:47.917 --> 56:50.542
Let's just hope the police
don't track them here.

56:50.667 --> 56:51.875
Because if they do

56:52.958 --> 56:55.125
we know what will happen.
Don't we, Adam?

56:55.167 --> 56:56.167
As agreed

56:56.500 --> 56:58.375
here's our first 75 thousand and

56:58.625 --> 57:00.125
plus, you've got
the other two boxes.

57:01.750 --> 57:02.750
Boss.

57:02.833 --> 57:06.042
There's 30 grand there
and the boxes are destroyed.

57:06.708 --> 57:07.708
Excellent.

57:08.958 --> 57:09.958
So...

57:10.625 --> 57:12.250
you have both brought me

57:12.292 --> 57:13.625
one hundred thousand today.

57:14.542 --> 57:16.083
I think we are going to

57:16.875 --> 57:19.667
build a brilliant
working partnership.

57:21.125 --> 57:22.125
Nozdrovia.

57:22.250 --> 57:25.292
[tense music]

57:34.667 --> 57:35.667
Sergeant Rice.

57:37.333 --> 57:38.333
Detective Crawford.

57:38.792 --> 57:39.792
What have we got here?

57:40.000 --> 57:41.250
It's an interesting one, sir.

57:41.542 --> 57:43.750
I'll let Saunders explain.
Saunders!

57:45.583 --> 57:46.792
-Sir?
-Thank you.

57:48.958 --> 57:50.333
-Saunders.
-Well, OK.

57:50.625 --> 57:51.958
Basic security van heist.

57:52.167 --> 57:54.917
Owners reckon about 40 grand's
been taken from the boxes.

57:55.250 --> 57:56.917
-But their paperwork's
gone missing.
-So.

57:57.000 --> 57:59.417
They're trying to claim back
on the insurance already, then.

57:59.458 --> 58:00.500
As to be expected.

58:00.750 --> 58:03.583
There's two perpetrators,
both wearing football kit
and rubber masks.

58:03.750 --> 58:05.042
We're looking at CCTV now.

58:05.333 --> 58:07.208
Any chance the shop owners
would be in on this?

58:07.583 --> 58:09.542
Possibly. They're not angels.

58:09.917 --> 58:11.583
But my instincts are
telling me otherwise.

58:11.667 --> 58:14.125
Normally, if it's an inside job
they'd be a bit more organized

58:14.208 --> 58:15.208
and this seemed a bit

58:15.750 --> 58:17.167
haphazard and opportunistic.

58:17.417 --> 58:18.417
What did the guards say?

58:18.458 --> 58:21.042
They've both been taken to the
station for further questioning.

58:21.125 --> 58:23.542
But it's company policy
not to tackle armed robbers.

58:25.458 --> 58:27.000
So, in other words

58:27.292 --> 58:29.833
two jokers rock up here
with guns and walk away with

58:29.875 --> 58:31.250
forty thousand pounds in cash.

58:31.583 --> 58:32.875
Without a shot being fired

58:34.083 --> 58:35.167
or a fist thrown.

58:35.917 --> 58:36.917
Hey?

58:37.917 --> 58:38.917
Excellent!

58:39.167 --> 58:41.708
[announcer] And finally, two men
dressed as footballers held up

58:41.792 --> 58:43.417
an armored car today in Romford.

58:43.667 --> 58:45.792
Although shots were fired,
no one was hurt.

58:45.917 --> 58:49.167
The thieves got away with an
estimated forty thousand pounds.

58:49.583 --> 58:51.667
Police are asking for
witnesses to come forward

58:51.875 --> 58:53.208
particularly a little boy

58:53.375 --> 58:55.250
who was seen on CCTV cameras

58:55.333 --> 58:57.958
moments before kicking a ball
in front of the robbers' car.

58:58.000 --> 58:59.000
[door opens]

59:02.750 --> 59:05.208
I can't believe this.
Why didn't you tell me?

59:06.167 --> 59:07.167
I don't know.

59:07.792 --> 59:08.917
Embarrassed, obvious.

59:09.208 --> 59:10.292
Besides, you had

59:10.333 --> 59:12.500
a lot on your plate with
the new signings and Marcel.

59:12.958 --> 59:15.917
Mate, all those problems are
so minor and irrelevant now.

59:16.708 --> 59:18.333
Chris, you might have
bought us some time

59:18.417 --> 59:19.875
but how the hell
are we gonna raise

59:19.917 --> 59:21.875
one million 900 thousand pounds

59:22.167 --> 59:23.333
in three and a half weeks?

59:24.375 --> 59:26.125
Especially if the mob
can't add up and all.

59:26.542 --> 59:28.333
I mean, we can't keep
hitting security vans.

59:28.500 --> 59:30.250
They don't have that
kind of money, and plus

59:30.875 --> 59:32.958
those tracking devices
freak me out and shit.

59:33.417 --> 59:35.375
No, no, the security vans
were just a starter.

59:35.542 --> 59:37.375
This is the key here,
I'm sure of it.

59:38.458 --> 59:39.792
We need to make
a plan of attack.

59:40.000 --> 59:41.458
Figure out our
opponent's weaknesses

59:41.750 --> 59:43.667
and bring home the cup
by the end of the season.

59:43.750 --> 59:44.958
[slaps paper down]

59:45.500 --> 59:48.583
[dramatic music]

59:53.708 --> 59:55.333
-We've found the car.
-Excellent.

59:55.542 --> 59:57.375
-Where?
-About an hour,
in Epping forest.

59:57.792 --> 1:00:00.375
It's a dead end, though. Owner
reported it stolen last week.

1:00:00.417 --> 1:00:02.458
And forensics have said
there's little to no chance

1:00:02.542 --> 1:00:03.875
of recovering
any useful evidence.

1:00:03.958 --> 1:00:05.667
Damn, I was hoping
to get some leads there.

1:00:05.958 --> 1:00:07.167
Also, we've

1:00:07.542 --> 1:00:08.958
got what we're looking for.

1:00:09.292 --> 1:00:10.292
Already?

1:00:10.417 --> 1:00:12.292
Excellent, excellent.
So what have we got?

1:00:12.833 --> 1:00:14.625
A known criminal
or just some rookies?

1:00:15.125 --> 1:00:16.875
-We definitely know him.
-Let's see.

1:00:19.333 --> 1:00:20.542
[laughs]

1:00:20.792 --> 1:00:22.708
Yeah, very funny, Lee.

1:00:23.083 --> 1:00:25.333
Yeah, well done, everybody.
[people laugh]

1:00:25.417 --> 1:00:26.417
Very funny!

1:00:26.917 --> 1:00:28.667
Well, let's just hope
you lot ain't laughing

1:00:28.750 --> 1:00:31.917
when this
couple of jokers accidentally
kill someone next time, hey?

1:00:38.708 --> 1:00:39.708
[door closes]

1:00:39.750 --> 1:00:42.792
[quiet music]

1:00:54.917 --> 1:00:56.417
[paper rustling]

1:01:05.375 --> 1:01:08.375
[music continues]

1:01:09.833 --> 1:01:12.875
[music becomes tense]

1:01:24.333 --> 1:01:25.375
Wow, Chris!

1:01:26.500 --> 1:01:27.500
[door closes]

1:01:27.875 --> 1:01:30.000
That's amazing. Really detailed.

1:01:30.125 --> 1:01:32.542
Well, mate,
if we're gonna do this,
we've got to do it right.

1:01:32.625 --> 1:01:35.125
-We can't afford any slip-ups.
-But how do we hit these shops?

1:01:35.167 --> 1:01:36.500
How do they have
this much money?

1:01:36.542 --> 1:01:37.875
That's where this list comes in.

1:01:37.917 --> 1:01:40.208
You see, I think this is a
list of other crime syndicates

1:01:40.292 --> 1:01:42.833
-fronting as proper businesses.
-How the hell did you get that?

1:01:42.875 --> 1:01:45.042
I swiped it off Demetri's desk
first time I was there.

1:01:45.542 --> 1:01:47.667
See, this way we know we're
robbing from the wrongers

1:01:47.708 --> 1:01:49.333
-and not the innocent.
-Now I feel like Robin Hood.

1:01:49.542 --> 1:01:50.542
Robbing from the rich

1:01:50.917 --> 1:01:52.958
-giving back to the richer.
-Except for, we're not.

1:01:53.333 --> 1:01:54.625
Adam, these guys are dangerous.

1:01:54.792 --> 1:01:57.750
If we're not careful,
we're gonna end up in
the middle of a gang turf war.

1:01:57.833 --> 1:01:58.917
It could be much worse.

1:01:59.458 --> 1:02:01.458
Really? How could it be worse?

1:02:03.667 --> 1:02:04.667
Well, umm...

1:02:05.667 --> 1:02:07.750
There's, well, umm...

1:02:08.208 --> 1:02:10.167
All right, it couldn't get
much worse than this.

1:02:10.208 --> 1:02:11.625
But how do you
rob all these shops?

1:02:11.708 --> 1:02:13.500
Don't you need a crew
or something like that?

1:02:13.542 --> 1:02:14.917
For now, it's
just gonna be us.

1:02:15.083 --> 1:02:16.083
So what's our first job?

1:02:16.833 --> 1:02:19.167
This really plush trader shop.

1:02:20.125 --> 1:02:23.208
[exciting music]

1:02:40.167 --> 1:02:43.208
[music continues]

1:03:00.208 --> 1:03:03.250
[music continues]

1:03:15.250 --> 1:03:16.375
[door bangs open]

1:03:18.417 --> 1:03:21.333
Oh my god, that was
fucking amazing! What a rush!

1:03:21.417 --> 1:03:23.458
-Shit, that fucking idiot.
-What's wrong?

1:03:23.542 --> 1:03:25.167
The store owner.
Just as we were leaving

1:03:25.250 --> 1:03:26.667
jumped down and
pulled my mask off.

1:03:26.708 --> 1:03:28.042
So what? Guy
didn't recognize you.

1:03:28.125 --> 1:03:30.208
Ashley didn't recognize you.
You're not that famous.

1:03:30.292 --> 1:03:33.250
That's not the point. He could
have CCTV images and all sorts.

1:03:33.375 --> 1:03:34.542
How much do you think we got?

1:03:34.625 --> 1:03:37.625
I don't know.
There's a lot of cash in there.
A lot more than I expected.

1:03:38.667 --> 1:03:40.125
Let's count it up, look online

1:03:40.375 --> 1:03:42.875
-get a rough estimate before
we drop it off to Demetri.
-Great.

1:03:43.250 --> 1:03:44.708
I don't want us to
come short again.

1:03:45.000 --> 1:03:46.000
[door opens]

1:03:49.083 --> 1:03:51.292
Sorry to keep you waiting,
Mr. Rahim. Here's your tea.

1:03:51.792 --> 1:03:54.542
No problem. If it helps
get these sons of bitches.

1:03:54.667 --> 1:03:55.958
Well, we do what we can.

1:03:57.125 --> 1:03:58.875
Do you want to tell me
what happened today?

1:03:58.917 --> 1:04:00.833
I was just about to
finish up for the day

1:04:01.208 --> 1:04:03.625
when, suddenly two men
in footballer's clothes

1:04:03.667 --> 1:04:05.625
-came in and held me up.
-Just two men?

1:04:06.083 --> 1:04:07.333
I, yes, I think so.

1:04:07.917 --> 1:04:09.000
It all happened so fast.

1:04:09.375 --> 1:04:10.750
Only two came into the shop

1:04:10.792 --> 1:04:13.000
but maybe there was
another outside, I'm not sure.

1:04:13.042 --> 1:04:14.042
And what then?

1:04:14.125 --> 1:04:16.750
Then one started filling up
his bags from the display

1:04:17.083 --> 1:04:18.583
and then when he was done and

1:04:18.667 --> 1:04:21.292
when I had given the
other one the money
from the till they left.

1:04:21.333 --> 1:04:22.333
I see.

1:04:22.542 --> 1:04:24.542
Well, we'll take
a look at your CCTV

1:04:24.583 --> 1:04:27.125
see if we can shed some more
light or get any more clues.

1:04:27.625 --> 1:04:29.083
Any idea how much was stolen?

1:04:29.500 --> 1:04:31.583
It's difficult to say,
I haven't cashed up yet.

1:04:32.083 --> 1:04:35.125
But I think there was at least
200 thousand pounds
of stock taken.

1:04:35.292 --> 1:04:37.500
Wow. I mean, I thought
these were trainers.

1:04:37.792 --> 1:04:38.792
Yes, well, but

1:04:38.917 --> 1:04:40.875
some of these go for
two or three grand a pair.

1:04:40.958 --> 1:04:42.750
Yeah, it makes sense
to see why they hit you.

1:04:42.958 --> 1:04:45.292
-Exactly.
-Yeah, but that's going
to be difficult to shift.

1:04:45.333 --> 1:04:47.500
Now you said to my colleague
they were wearing masks.

1:04:47.542 --> 1:04:50.042
Is there anything else
recognizable about these men?

1:04:50.292 --> 1:04:52.167
That might help me
with my investigations?

1:04:52.250 --> 1:04:53.958
Yes. One was Chris Rose.

1:04:55.458 --> 1:04:56.667
I'm sorry. What did you say?

1:04:57.208 --> 1:04:59.583
One of the men, the one
with the gun, was Chris Rose.

1:05:00.708 --> 1:05:03.542
You mean, he looked like
the football player Chris Rose?

1:05:03.625 --> 1:05:05.542
No, no, I mean,
I grabbed hold of his mask

1:05:05.792 --> 1:05:07.750
and when I looked underneath,
it was Chris Rose.

1:05:09.083 --> 1:05:10.458
Saunders!

1:05:14.208 --> 1:05:15.208

1:05:24.333 --> 1:05:25.333
[bag in trunk]

1:05:25.417 --> 1:05:27.667
Right. I'll take these home
and you get rid of the car.

1:05:27.792 --> 1:05:28.792
Same place as last time?

1:05:28.917 --> 1:05:30.292
No, make it somewhere different.

1:05:30.375 --> 1:05:32.125
By now the police
will be looking for it, so...

1:05:32.250 --> 1:05:33.917
-make it elsewhere,
make it quick.
-Got it.

1:05:34.333 --> 1:05:36.167
I can't believe that this time
tomorrow Dimitri a round

1:05:36.333 --> 1:05:37.625
five hundred thousand pounds.

1:05:38.125 --> 1:05:39.167
Thanks for doing this, bruv

1:05:39.208 --> 1:05:41.042
-Couldn't have
done it without you.
-Well, mate...

1:05:41.125 --> 1:05:43.042
you know what they say,
a friend helps you move.

1:05:43.125 --> 1:05:44.917
But a true friend helps you
move a dead body.

1:05:44.958 --> 1:05:46.500
Look, we're gonna
get this sorted, OK?

1:05:52.583 --> 1:05:53.708
[car door closes]

1:05:55.125 --> 1:05:56.583
It certainly looks like him.

1:05:56.958 --> 1:05:59.250
Perhaps, but why would a
Premiership footballer

1:05:59.292 --> 1:06:01.917
big a fallen armed robbery?
It just doesn't make sense.

1:06:02.542 --> 1:06:03.833
Maybe he's got a twin brother.

1:06:04.667 --> 1:06:06.167
Or maybe he's wearing two masks.

1:06:06.542 --> 1:06:09.375
You and your outlandish
theories, Saunders.

1:06:10.250 --> 1:06:13.417
I can't ignore there is a
very strong resemblance.

1:06:13.625 --> 1:06:17.000
So why don't we go
and have a little chat
with Mr. Chris Rose, hey?

1:06:22.458 --> 1:06:24.625
[cellphone rings]

1:06:27.000 --> 1:06:29.417
Hi, Chris. It's me, Ashley.

1:06:30.333 --> 1:06:32.708
I'm so sorry about what I said.

1:06:33.958 --> 1:06:36.167
I've been meaning to call you
for a couple of days now.

1:06:37.667 --> 1:06:39.333
I, I miss you, darling.

1:06:40.417 --> 1:06:41.417
I need you.

1:06:42.792 --> 1:06:44.500
I just, overreacted.

1:06:46.333 --> 1:06:48.542
Can you call me back when
you get this message, please?

1:06:49.500 --> 1:06:50.500
Bye.

1:06:50.542 --> 1:06:53.333

Chris Rose?

1:07:17.167 --> 1:07:18.167
Ummm.

1:07:18.458 --> 1:07:19.458
Yeah, who wants to know?

1:07:19.583 --> 1:07:23.417
I'm Detective Sergeant Crawford
and this is Sergeant Saunders.

1:07:24.667 --> 1:07:25.667
Right. How can I help?

1:07:26.250 --> 1:07:28.542
To be absolutely honest
with you, I'm not sure you can.

1:07:29.292 --> 1:07:31.625
We're investigating
a robbery that
happened today.

1:07:32.333 --> 1:07:33.333
Your name has come up.

1:07:33.417 --> 1:07:35.042
We're just wondering
if you can come down

1:07:35.083 --> 1:07:37.250
to the station, just to answer
a few simple questions.

1:07:37.333 --> 1:07:39.750
I don't understand. Do I need
to call a lawyer or something?

1:07:39.833 --> 1:07:41.000
Oh god no, nothing like that.

1:07:41.083 --> 1:07:43.417
We just want to rule you out
of our inquiries, that's all.

1:07:43.458 --> 1:07:46.042
Well, it's getting a bit late.
Could we do this
tomorrow morning?

1:07:46.083 --> 1:07:48.792
Rather do it now,
just to get things out of
the way, you understand?

1:07:49.417 --> 1:07:50.792
OK, so, shall I
come in your car?

1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:53.417
-Perfect.
-I'll tell you what.
Saunders can drive your car.

1:07:54.917 --> 1:07:56.583
Don't worry about it,
he's a good driver.

1:07:57.708 --> 1:08:00.208
If you can't trust a policeman,
then who can you trust, hey?

1:08:00.917 --> 1:08:01.917
Mr. Rose.

1:08:02.000 --> 1:08:05.000
[soft dramatic music]

1:08:10.167 --> 1:08:11.292
[car door closes]

1:08:20.125 --> 1:08:21.250
[car door closes]

1:08:30.917 --> 1:08:33.042
Adam do this, Adam do that.

1:08:33.167 --> 1:08:35.208
I'm sure I got the
short straw in this shit.

1:08:35.917 --> 1:08:37.458
Would you mind if I
make a phone call?

1:08:37.500 --> 1:08:39.625
I'm supposed to be meeting
a friend of mine tomorrow.

1:08:39.708 --> 1:08:41.542
And because it's late
I think I should cancel.

1:08:41.875 --> 1:08:42.958
Yeah, sure, no problem.

1:08:43.208 --> 1:08:45.417
But would you mind
putting it on speakerphone?

1:08:50.958 --> 1:08:52.500
[cellphone rings]
Who the fuck is that?

1:08:52.917 --> 1:08:54.208
[cellphone rings]

1:08:55.375 --> 1:08:57.542
Hi Adam, sorry it's late.
I hope I didn't wake you.

1:08:58.000 --> 1:08:59.000
Of course not. What's up?

1:08:59.292 --> 1:09:01.833
I don't want you
to panic because there's
nothing to worry about

1:09:01.917 --> 1:09:04.583
but I'm currently sitting
in the back of a
police car on the way to

1:09:04.625 --> 1:09:06.833
-Whitechapel Police Station.
-Did you hear that, mate?

1:09:07.375 --> 1:09:08.583
Fucking hell, Chris, man.

1:09:08.667 --> 1:09:10.375
What's happened?
What do you want me to do?

1:09:10.417 --> 1:09:12.583
First of all, I'm not sure
I'm gonna make training

1:09:12.667 --> 1:09:13.917
session tomorrow with Demetri.

1:09:14.375 --> 1:09:16.208
So if you can sweat
that out, please, and

1:09:16.500 --> 1:09:18.333
also, if you can meet me
at the station later.

1:09:18.500 --> 1:09:21.042
Of course, mate. I'm in a bit of
car trouble at the moment.

1:09:21.542 --> 1:09:24.333
That's fine, mate.
My car's at the station,
you can borrow that.

1:09:24.375 --> 1:09:25.875
You know where
the spare key is and

1:09:26.875 --> 1:09:29.208
I'll see you at the station, OK?
I've got to go now, mate.

1:09:29.917 --> 1:09:31.625
Yeah, I'll call you later
when I need you.

1:09:31.875 --> 1:09:33.292
OK, broth,
I'll wait for your call.

1:09:33.375 --> 1:09:34.417
-Cheers.
-Good luck to you.

1:09:34.500 --> 1:09:37.500
[tense music builds]

1:09:57.208 --> 1:09:58.625
[pages turning]

1:10:03.083 --> 1:10:05.792
For the benefit of the tape,
this is an informal interview

1:10:05.833 --> 1:10:08.583
-with Mr. Chris Rose on the,
umm- -Eighteenth.

1:10:09.375 --> 1:10:11.333
Eighteenth of July at, umm...

1:10:11.708 --> 1:10:13.000
Twelve-thirty, a.m.

1:10:13.250 --> 1:10:14.750
Uh, twelve-thirty, a.m.

1:10:15.333 --> 1:10:17.083
Firstly, I'd like to say
thank you very much

1:10:17.125 --> 1:10:19.250
for helping us with
our inquiries, Mr. Rose.

1:10:19.333 --> 1:10:20.708
It's no problem.
I'm happy to help.

1:10:20.792 --> 1:10:22.542
I just wish it was
a bit earlier in the day.

1:10:22.625 --> 1:10:24.458
-And I wish I knew
what this was about.
-Quiet.

1:10:24.917 --> 1:10:27.208
Anyway, we brought you in
because we believe

1:10:27.292 --> 1:10:28.667
you might be able to help us

1:10:28.875 --> 1:10:29.917
answer some very

1:10:30.167 --> 1:10:31.542
puzzling questions we have.

1:10:32.042 --> 1:10:33.250
Can you tell us where you were

1:10:33.375 --> 1:10:34.417
at 5 p.m. today?

1:10:34.458 --> 1:10:36.042
Yeah, I can. It's

1:10:36.458 --> 1:10:39.333
slightly embarrassing,
but I was breaking up
with my girlfriend Ashley.

1:10:39.500 --> 1:10:41.042
And she can
verify that, can she?

1:10:41.125 --> 1:10:42.792
Yeah. Yeah,
of course she can. It was

1:10:43.250 --> 1:10:44.750
bit ugly, how we left it.

1:10:44.833 --> 1:10:46.333
So I don't know
how helpful she'll be.

1:10:46.417 --> 1:10:48.083
See, I, I cheated on her.

1:10:49.708 --> 1:10:51.667
But I do have this
text message which might help.

1:10:55.250 --> 1:10:56.250
Ah, yeah.

1:10:56.625 --> 1:10:58.000
Can you tell me
what this is about?

1:10:58.083 --> 1:10:59.458
Well, today at 5 p.m.

1:10:59.750 --> 1:11:02.000
two guys walked into the
East London Trainer Store

1:11:02.250 --> 1:11:03.250
sneakers

1:11:03.542 --> 1:11:04.542
and robbed it

1:11:04.792 --> 1:11:07.250
-wearing footballers' masks.
-Oh my god, was it a mask of me?

1:11:07.333 --> 1:11:08.333
Why would you think that?

1:11:08.417 --> 1:11:10.208
Well, recently my agent
signed this deal with

1:11:10.292 --> 1:11:12.750
this practical joke company,
making rubber masks
for the fans.

1:11:14.667 --> 1:11:17.250
-Look, like I can show you here.
-That won't be necessary.

1:11:17.667 --> 1:11:19.625
The reason we asked you
to come in is because two

1:11:19.708 --> 1:11:22.000
of the thieves have committed
two crimes that we know of.

1:11:22.292 --> 1:11:24.333
You might have seen reports
in the papers last week

1:11:24.417 --> 1:11:25.750
about the security van heist?

1:11:26.833 --> 1:11:28.167
Where the two thieves were

1:11:28.667 --> 1:11:31.042
dressed and had masks on
like professional footballers?

1:11:31.708 --> 1:11:34.167
Well, although the MO's on
these robberies have changed

1:11:35.333 --> 1:11:37.792
we believe they were committed
by the same pair of guys.

1:11:38.083 --> 1:11:39.208
Wait, sorry, I'm confused.

1:11:39.250 --> 1:11:42.292
So off of that, you're
going to interview
every Premiership footballer?

1:11:43.250 --> 1:11:45.417
-Good luck with that.
-Of course not, no. No.

1:11:46.292 --> 1:11:48.333
No. You see, today
we got a lucky break.

1:11:49.167 --> 1:11:52.333
Well, during the robbery
the guy with the gun
got his mask knocked off.

1:11:53.417 --> 1:11:54.667
Shop CCTV

1:11:55.958 --> 1:11:57.375
caught his face on camera.

1:12:03.625 --> 1:12:05.667
Oh wow, I see now why
you wanted to speak to me.

1:12:05.917 --> 1:12:07.542
My god, it does look
like me, doesn't it?

1:12:07.625 --> 1:12:10.125
-And you're saying it's not--
-No, no, it's definitely not me.

1:12:10.167 --> 1:12:11.667
I mean, I can see
why you think it is.

1:12:11.750 --> 1:12:13.833
If I had a twin brother,
I'd be interviewing as well

1:12:13.917 --> 1:12:15.542
but, like I said,
it's definitely not me.

1:12:15.583 --> 1:12:17.042
I'm a Premiership
football player.

1:12:17.542 --> 1:12:18.792
Why would I want to rob a shop?

1:12:19.042 --> 1:12:20.708
And that is what's confusing us.

1:12:21.208 --> 1:12:23.875
As I understand it you recently
signed for East Stratford

1:12:23.917 --> 1:12:25.750
and according to their press
you aren't happy

1:12:25.792 --> 1:12:27.375
with the transfer deal.
Is that correct?

1:12:27.458 --> 1:12:30.625
Yeah, but that's got
nothing to do with this.
That deal made me a good living.

1:12:30.667 --> 1:12:32.917
I was annoyed that another
player got paid more than me.

1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:35.875
OK. I also hear that
sometimes footballers

1:12:36.333 --> 1:12:39.708
want to make the new player
perform initiation pranks.

1:12:40.125 --> 1:12:41.750
Do you think this is
some sort of a joke?

1:12:42.167 --> 1:12:44.292
If East Stratford knew
I was here, I'd be sacked.

1:12:44.375 --> 1:12:45.500
Look, Mr. Rose.

1:12:46.667 --> 1:12:47.708
[ominous music]

1:12:47.833 --> 1:12:48.833
Chris.

1:12:49.792 --> 1:12:51.542
All I'm saying is that sometimes

1:12:51.625 --> 1:12:53.500
people do some very silly things

1:12:53.583 --> 1:12:55.208
for any range of reasons.

1:12:56.708 --> 1:12:58.125
And if for any reason

1:12:58.833 --> 1:13:00.917
that man in that
photograph is you

1:13:01.958 --> 1:13:03.292
then I advise you to tell us

1:13:03.917 --> 1:13:05.542
before it gets out of control.

1:13:06.167 --> 1:13:09.208
[tense music]

1:13:11.208 --> 1:13:12.542
Bloody hell, mate.
What happened?

1:13:12.625 --> 1:13:14.000
Oh, not much.
Let's get in the car.

1:13:14.083 --> 1:13:16.125
-So what happened, mate?
-I'll tell you in the car.

1:13:16.167 --> 1:13:17.542
Mr. Rose! Mr. Rose.

1:13:18.250 --> 1:13:20.875
Just, just one more thing, umm

1:13:21.458 --> 1:13:22.792
Here, yeah.

1:13:24.000 --> 1:13:25.083
Here are my details.

1:13:26.083 --> 1:13:27.375
If you remember anything

1:13:27.583 --> 1:13:29.083
or think of any more
you can tell us

1:13:29.167 --> 1:13:30.583
you just give me a call, OK?

1:13:30.667 --> 1:13:32.500
Yeah, of course,
Detective. Thank you.

1:13:33.583 --> 1:13:35.667
Wow, that is a beautiful motor.

1:13:36.000 --> 1:13:38.083
You know, I've got two big
German shepherds at home.

1:13:38.125 --> 1:13:41.333
And my wife is always
banging on at me
about getting a bigger car.

1:13:42.417 --> 1:13:43.875
And that can accommodate them.

1:13:44.250 --> 1:13:45.250
Ho ho.

1:13:46.333 --> 1:13:47.333
Ah, yes.

1:13:48.000 --> 1:13:49.208
You don't mind, do you?

1:13:58.583 --> 1:14:01.333
-What do we have here?
-That's a long story, Detective.

1:14:02.625 --> 1:14:03.625
You know what?

1:14:04.333 --> 1:14:06.875
I don't think that boot's the
right shape for us after all.

1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:10.042
[upbeat music]

1:14:18.250 --> 1:14:20.333
Oh, I thought we
were done for then.

1:14:20.417 --> 1:14:22.125
You really have
no faith in me, do you?

1:14:22.250 --> 1:14:25.000
-What happened there, mate?
-I realized
I need to get the loot.

1:14:25.083 --> 1:14:26.083
Get the stuff sorted.

1:14:26.208 --> 1:14:28.292
So I picked it up, took it
right round to Demetri's.

1:14:28.375 --> 1:14:30.792
-Came straight out.
-Brilliant, mate. That is class!

1:14:32.208 --> 1:14:34.708
Listen, it's time
to go. I've had
enough of this police station.

1:14:35.208 --> 1:14:36.542
-Adam?
-Yeah, mate.

1:14:36.750 --> 1:14:38.208
What's the story
with the bras, then?

1:14:38.292 --> 1:14:39.917
I knew he'd look in
the boot so I thought

1:14:40.000 --> 1:14:41.667
-it would be funny if
I replaced it with bras.
-Funny?

1:14:41.750 --> 1:14:43.833
-You thought it'd be funny?
-Yeah, but it went better
than I thought.

1:14:43.875 --> 1:14:46.250
And when the copper looked in
the back you should have seen

1:14:46.333 --> 1:14:47.542
the look on your face.

1:14:47.625 --> 1:14:49.042
Where'd you even
get a box full of-?

1:14:49.125 --> 1:14:51.167
Actually, you know what?
I don't even want to know.

1:14:51.208 --> 1:14:52.458
Adam, you're such a bastard.

1:14:52.542 --> 1:14:55.542
[car engine]

1:15:02.750 --> 1:15:05.083
[Alexei]
I guess we can give
the trainers to the team.

1:15:06.167 --> 1:15:07.708
Probably not your style, Karina.

1:15:08.833 --> 1:15:09.833
True.

1:15:11.625 --> 1:15:12.917
Alexei, my brother.

1:15:13.708 --> 1:15:16.750
When that fucking idiot
scored his goal

1:15:18.417 --> 1:15:20.125
I thought we'd
lost a lot of money.

1:15:21.625 --> 1:15:22.667
But you know what?

1:15:23.333 --> 1:15:24.833
I think it could be the

1:15:25.458 --> 1:15:27.792
-best thing that
ever happened for us.
-I agree.

1:15:29.167 --> 1:15:31.167
But they have already
paid back over a quarter

1:15:31.417 --> 1:15:33.167
of what they owe
in under a week.

1:15:33.375 --> 1:15:35.542
Before we know it,
they will be gone.

1:15:36.917 --> 1:15:38.542
You're such a prophet of doom.

1:15:39.875 --> 1:15:41.542
All that means is that we

1:15:41.833 --> 1:15:43.042
and our associates

1:15:43.833 --> 1:15:45.333
will get our money back quicker.

1:15:45.417 --> 1:15:46.792
But I like this arrangement.

1:15:48.167 --> 1:15:50.458
Free money, at no risk to us.

1:15:51.833 --> 1:15:52.833
And who says

1:15:53.417 --> 1:15:54.708
that it has to end?

1:16:00.958 --> 1:16:02.583
I'm knackered, mate. What a day.

1:16:02.833 --> 1:16:04.375
Yeah, I better go home before it
gets any later.

1:16:04.458 --> 1:16:05.583
You might as well stay here.

1:16:06.417 --> 1:16:07.917
You don't have a bed
at home, anyway.

1:16:09.375 --> 1:16:10.375
Not really.

1:16:11.000 --> 1:16:12.083
Just a sleeping bag and

1:16:12.583 --> 1:16:13.625
kipping on the floor.

1:16:15.625 --> 1:16:17.500
So what happened tonight?
They really on to us?

1:16:20.542 --> 1:16:21.542
I don't know.

1:16:21.708 --> 1:16:23.917
They have a picture of us
in the shop, that's about it.

1:16:23.958 --> 1:16:25.375
Well, that's it then.
We're fucked!

1:16:25.417 --> 1:16:26.917
Now, mate, don't
be such a defeatist.

1:16:26.958 --> 1:16:29.208
That's why I signed with the
Premiership and you didn't.

1:16:29.292 --> 1:16:31.750
-So what are we
going to do then?
-We're continuing as before.

1:16:31.958 --> 1:16:34.208
We're just gonna be a bit
smarter about it, that's all.

1:16:34.583 --> 1:16:36.875
We're gonna start with something
you suggested yesterday.

1:16:39.958 --> 1:16:40.958
So

1:16:41.458 --> 1:16:42.458
in essence

1:16:43.042 --> 1:16:44.042
I believe

1:16:44.750 --> 1:16:47.208
that although we are playing
extremely well individually

1:16:48.250 --> 1:16:49.333
we're still having trouble

1:16:49.750 --> 1:16:51.042
I say that fucking lightly

1:16:51.333 --> 1:16:52.417
gelling as a team.

1:16:55.417 --> 1:16:57.417
OK, I know what you're thinking.

1:16:58.667 --> 1:17:00.625
This isn't limited to one
area of the side, lads.

1:17:00.958 --> 1:17:02.125
So no pointing fingers.

1:17:02.833 --> 1:17:04.250
This is a problem
across the board.

1:17:05.250 --> 1:17:06.250
However

1:17:06.458 --> 1:17:07.542
I have a solution.

1:17:08.333 --> 1:17:10.333
I feel we should do some
team activities together

1:17:10.417 --> 1:17:11.500
other than football.

1:17:11.625 --> 1:17:12.667
A little bonding session.

1:17:12.708 --> 1:17:14.875
Come on, coach, we're
supposed to be a football team.

1:17:14.917 --> 1:17:16.792
Are you really planning
on sending us on some

1:17:16.875 --> 1:17:19.458
-team-building weekend?
-Yeah, yeah, I've got
to agree with Marcel.

1:17:19.542 --> 1:17:20.917
I don't think
that's the way to go.

1:17:21.167 --> 1:17:23.250
I'm pleased to hear you
two guys agree on something.

1:17:24.167 --> 1:17:25.167
To be fair

1:17:25.917 --> 1:17:27.333
I thought you
choose the activity.

1:17:27.792 --> 1:17:29.250
So get your little
thinking caps on.

1:17:29.583 --> 1:17:31.000
I want ideas by
the end of the week.

1:17:31.083 --> 1:17:33.583
As long as the insurance cover
is OK with it, then so am I.

1:17:34.417 --> 1:17:36.167
Get your stuff together,
and let's go.

1:17:36.875 --> 1:17:39.958
[rhythmic modern music]

1:18:01.250 --> 1:18:02.583
Right, broth, let's do this.

1:18:03.625 --> 1:18:06.625
[fast-paced music]

1:18:10.167 --> 1:18:12.250
-Give us the money!
-All right, give me the cash.

1:18:12.333 --> 1:18:14.583
-All the cash, now.
-Come on, come on.
Get the money out.

1:18:14.750 --> 1:18:15.750
Hurry up!

1:18:15.833 --> 1:18:18.750
-That's it, that's it.
The rest of the cash.
-All the money, now.

1:18:22.042 --> 1:18:23.042
Come on.

1:18:23.125 --> 1:18:25.292
Give me a chocolate bar.
Give me a chocolate bar, now!

1:18:25.333 --> 1:18:26.667
Hurry up.

1:18:26.750 --> 1:18:28.583
Wait for me, man.
I can't find that box.

1:18:30.958 --> 1:18:33.958
[fast-paced music continues]

1:18:42.333 --> 1:18:43.583
Give us your money.

1:18:44.792 --> 1:18:46.583
-Give us your money now.
-Put it in the bag.

1:18:47.250 --> 1:18:48.250
Now!

1:18:48.292 --> 1:18:50.333
Any jewels, anything you
have, pull it. That's it.

1:18:51.375 --> 1:18:52.833
You've got stuff,
put it in the bag.

1:18:53.292 --> 1:18:55.042
-Don't you fucking move.
-Come on, hurry up.

1:18:55.375 --> 1:18:56.458
-Give me a drink.
-Come on.

1:18:57.292 --> 1:18:59.500
Put your money in the bag.
Come on, let's go, let's go.

1:19:07.042 --> 1:19:08.417
Stay calm, stay calm.

1:19:08.542 --> 1:19:10.375
-I'll check the back.
-Give us all your money.

1:19:10.458 --> 1:19:11.458
Fill the bag.

1:19:11.583 --> 1:19:13.583
You're not gonna get hurt.
Just give us the money.

1:19:13.667 --> 1:19:14.667
OK? Stay calm.

1:19:15.375 --> 1:19:17.417
You're not gonna get hurt.
Just give us the money.

1:19:17.500 --> 1:19:19.042
OK. Stay calm. Fill
the bag with money.

1:19:19.125 --> 1:19:20.542
The back's clear,
the back's clear.

1:19:20.708 --> 1:19:22.417
There's more there.
Come on, get the rest.

1:19:25.167 --> 1:19:26.917
More, there's more,
there's more, let's go.

1:19:27.000 --> 1:19:28.083
Fifteen seconds.

1:19:31.708 --> 1:19:32.917
There's nothing else.

1:19:36.167 --> 1:19:38.500
Those Ex-Footie Captains,
they've struck again.

1:19:38.958 --> 1:19:40.125
Wait, what did you call them?

1:19:40.208 --> 1:19:43.083
It was the papers.
They're calling them
the Ex-Footie Captains.

1:19:43.125 --> 1:19:44.125
Yeah, I see.

1:19:44.208 --> 1:19:45.667
Oh well, told you
they would, though.

1:19:46.083 --> 1:19:47.833
-Come on, let's get going.
-Not but sir...

1:19:48.292 --> 1:19:49.625
It's another Algerian business.

1:19:49.875 --> 1:19:51.625
Now that is not good news.

1:19:52.375 --> 1:19:53.375
Move it.

1:19:53.417 --> 1:19:56.458
[tense music]

1:20:03.958 --> 1:20:06.083
[announcer] Police are baffled
by a sudden escalation

1:20:06.167 --> 1:20:08.542
in the east London Essex area.

1:20:08.625 --> 1:20:10.750
An official statement from
Scotland Yard this evening

1:20:10.833 --> 1:20:12.292
says the public should
not be alarmed

1:20:12.333 --> 1:20:13.667
as everything is under control.

1:20:13.792 --> 1:20:16.500
However, many
critics have slammed
police procedures in this case

1:20:16.542 --> 1:20:18.167
as amateur and bumbling.

1:20:18.208 --> 1:20:19.333
[slams paper on desk]

1:20:20.125 --> 1:20:22.583
-You've seen the paper, then?
-You said it'd all be over soon.

1:20:22.667 --> 1:20:25.042
Because tomorrow I'm bringing
in Chris and Adam again.

1:20:26.250 --> 1:20:29.292
[upbeat music]

1:20:38.167 --> 1:20:40.375
Well, mate, this is it.
We made it to the end.

1:20:40.625 --> 1:20:42.375
Three weeks of hard graft

1:20:42.458 --> 1:20:44.125
and only 500 grand left to get.

1:20:46.042 --> 1:20:47.500
-What are you drinking?
-Vodka.

1:20:48.375 --> 1:20:50.833
I've acquired quite a taste for
this over the past few weeks.

1:20:51.333 --> 1:20:52.458
Why are we meeting in here?

1:20:53.083 --> 1:20:54.083
I thought

1:20:54.417 --> 1:20:55.417
if we're gonna do this

1:20:55.792 --> 1:20:57.125
we might as well do it in style.

1:20:57.458 --> 1:20:58.875
Premiership footballer style.

1:20:58.958 --> 1:21:01.958
[upbeat music building]

1:21:04.542 --> 1:21:07.042
Lads, thanks so much for
doing this for my friend and I.

1:21:07.708 --> 1:21:10.292
Well, the coach did say
he wanted us to
do more stuff together.

1:21:10.333 --> 1:21:11.417
Yeah, that's true.

1:21:11.625 --> 1:21:13.833
But I think he meant something
a little less dangerous.

1:21:14.375 --> 1:21:15.375
Listen, boys

1:21:15.500 --> 1:21:16.625
if anyone wants to back out

1:21:17.000 --> 1:21:18.083
now is the time.

1:21:18.333 --> 1:21:20.125
No one's gonna think
any worse of you for it.

1:21:20.208 --> 1:21:22.708
You've been given
your assignments,
now you're part of the plan.

1:21:23.083 --> 1:21:25.208
Over here we've got
the masks, outfits and tools.

1:21:25.583 --> 1:21:27.500
Once you guys get changed,
let's meet at the bus

1:21:27.917 --> 1:21:29.417
it's gonna take us
to tonight's venue.

[music fades away]

1:22:11.208 --> 1:22:12.208
Right, boys.

1:22:12.292 --> 1:22:14.458
You and you stay here.
The rest of you get inside now.

1:22:14.667 --> 1:22:15.708
Let's go, let's go.

1:22:15.750 --> 1:22:18.792
[upbeat music]

1:22:24.792 --> 1:22:27.042
Right, boys. Now we're in,
grab as much as you can carry

1:22:27.125 --> 1:22:29.375
and let's get out of here
as quick as you can. Let's go.

1:22:32.542 --> 1:22:33.542
Here we are.

1:22:34.042 --> 1:22:35.042
Final payday.

1:22:35.958 --> 1:22:36.958
You ready to do this?

1:22:37.250 --> 1:22:38.542
I've been ready since day one.

1:22:39.125 --> 1:22:40.167
Let's get this over with.

1:22:44.583 --> 1:22:45.750
[car doors close]

1:22:51.542 --> 1:22:52.833
There's ten more bags in my car.

1:22:53.875 --> 1:22:56.083
At a rough count,
we made it 700 grand in total.

1:22:56.583 --> 1:22:57.583
[throws money on table]

and bring up the bags.

1:23:08.583 --> 1:23:11.583
[footsteps]

1:23:17.417 --> 1:23:20.250
But you only owed me
another five hundred.

1:23:20.500 --> 1:23:21.500
Why the extra?

1:23:23.125 --> 1:23:24.125
We got lucky.

1:23:24.583 --> 1:23:26.542
We hope the extra 200 grand
will buy our freedom.

1:23:26.583 --> 1:23:28.208
We figured you probably
had no intention

1:23:28.250 --> 1:23:30.458
-of letting us go
after we paid you back.
-Very clever.

1:23:31.125 --> 1:23:32.125
Very smart.

1:23:32.250 --> 1:23:33.250
And

1:23:33.500 --> 1:23:34.500
very correct.

1:23:34.792 --> 1:23:35.792
[swallows vodka]

1:23:36.000 --> 1:23:37.000
However

1:23:37.167 --> 1:23:39.333
you are an honorable man,
Christopher Rose.

1:23:39.625 --> 1:23:41.750
You promised that you
would pay me back

1:23:42.083 --> 1:23:43.083
and you have.

1:23:45.583 --> 1:23:46.583
So

1:23:48.833 --> 1:23:50.417
what do I do now?

1:23:52.625 --> 1:23:54.208
Alexei, what do you think?

Now the police
are on their tails

1:23:58.750 --> 1:23:59.958
I say let them go.

1:24:00.792 --> 1:24:02.042
One in the hand, and all that.

1:24:02.167 --> 1:24:03.167
I agree.

1:24:03.625 --> 1:24:05.167
They got lucky, this time.

1:24:05.625 --> 1:24:07.833
We don't want to push, our luck.

1:24:08.292 --> 1:24:11.375
-Look at the mess they
made of the original deal.
-It's true.

1:24:15.708 --> 1:24:16.708
OK.

1:24:17.000 --> 1:24:18.250
You have a deal, boys.

1:24:18.833 --> 1:24:20.958
You have bought
your freedom. But

1:24:21.750 --> 1:24:22.750
I never

1:24:23.667 --> 1:24:26.542
want to cross paths
with either one of you

1:24:27.583 --> 1:24:28.583
again.

1:24:29.000 --> 1:24:30.208
Do I make myself clear?

1:24:30.250 --> 1:24:31.792
-Not a peep.
-No more gambling for me.

Get your hands off of me!

I'm sorry, Chris. What
the hell just happened?

1:25:29.500 --> 1:25:32.083
Mate, I couldn't tell
you. But I've been
working with the police.

1:25:32.125 --> 1:25:33.667
Detective, can you
take these off now?

1:25:33.708 --> 1:25:36.250
Tell me, why the fuck not?
We're best mates.

1:25:36.542 --> 1:25:39.125
-We tell each other everything.
-Plausible deniability, mate.

1:25:39.208 --> 1:25:40.917
Aka, you're shit at lying.

1:25:41.542 --> 1:25:43.458
You wonder why you lost
so much money gambling?

1:25:43.625 --> 1:25:44.708
You have a tell.

1:25:44.958 --> 1:25:47.042
You rub your nose when
you're not telling the truth.

Detective.

1:25:49.250 --> 1:25:51.792
-Did we get enough evidence?
-We got the whole conversation.

1:25:52.625 --> 1:25:56.292
I think Demetri and his pals
will be going away
for a very long time.

1:25:57.125 --> 1:25:59.292
Well, now, Chris,
I have so many questions.

1:25:59.542 --> 1:26:00.750
I don't know where to start.

1:26:00.875 --> 1:26:03.042
Well, mate, it started when
I went into questioning.

1:26:03.125 --> 1:26:04.917
[whoosh]
If for any reason

1:26:05.542 --> 1:26:07.333
that man in that
photograph is you

1:26:08.708 --> 1:26:10.042
then I advise you to tell us

1:26:10.667 --> 1:26:12.333
before it gets out of control.

1:26:18.542 --> 1:26:19.958
OK, OK, you're right.

1:26:20.542 --> 1:26:21.583
It is me in the picture.

1:26:23.042 --> 1:26:25.417
My friend and I
are being blackmailed
by the Russian mafia.

1:26:26.125 --> 1:26:27.333
And we need to pay them back.

lovely missus of yours, hey?

Umm, yeah, I might.

1:26:38.208 --> 1:26:39.792

-I'll leave you to it, then.

Now do you want to tell me
how you got involved

with the Russian mafia?

1:27:04.208 --> 1:27:07.250
[music continues]

1:27:09.958 --> 1:27:12.000
I guess Crawford reminds
you of your old man.

1:27:12.792 --> 1:27:14.208
He was Old Bill too, wasn't he?

1:27:17.708 --> 1:27:20.042
[Crawford] It was Chris' only
way out of this nightmare.

1:27:20.917 --> 1:27:22.958
Together, we came up
with a new plan.

1:27:23.500 --> 1:27:25.083
One that would keep
Demetri thinking

1:27:25.125 --> 1:27:26.875
we the police knew nothing.

1:27:31.417 --> 1:27:33.083
Hey, Crawford, it's Rice.

1:27:33.917 --> 1:27:34.958
It's going down now.

1:27:36.042 --> 1:27:37.333
[Chris] And after all, mate.

1:27:37.542 --> 1:27:39.625
What police service would
allow two guys to carry on

1:27:39.708 --> 1:27:40.708
stealing stuff?

1:27:41.042 --> 1:27:43.083
Didn't you ever wonder how
Demetri was able to keep

1:27:43.167 --> 1:27:44.167
such close tabs on us?

1:27:45.167 --> 1:27:46.833
It was because
the mobile Alexei gave me

1:27:47.292 --> 1:27:49.042
they simply used it
to track our movements.

1:27:49.875 --> 1:27:50.958
And knowing that

1:27:51.292 --> 1:27:52.917
aided me in the second
part of our plan.

1:27:54.917 --> 1:27:55.917
Sergeant Rice.

1:27:56.000 --> 1:27:57.000
Is it happening tonight?

1:27:57.083 --> 1:27:58.958
Yes, we've been informed.
They're on their way.

1:27:59.917 --> 1:28:01.000
[Chris] From that point on

1:28:01.250 --> 1:28:03.167
all the crimes were
faked by the police.

1:28:03.458 --> 1:28:04.958
Using confiscated evidence

1:28:05.042 --> 1:28:06.417
and police funds as loot.

1:28:06.667 --> 1:28:09.625
I know this is one of Crawford's
hare-brained schemes.

1:28:09.875 --> 1:28:11.167
We've all done schemes before.

1:28:11.250 --> 1:28:13.625
So get into your civvies and
get your kit in a box, please.

1:28:13.875 --> 1:28:14.875
But eventually

1:28:15.458 --> 1:28:17.292
we knew we needed to
bring it to a proper end.

1:28:17.792 --> 1:28:19.542
The police couldn't fund
the fakery any more

1:28:19.625 --> 1:28:21.500
and we needed a result
before Demetri moved

1:28:21.542 --> 1:28:22.708
all our ill-gotten gains.

1:28:23.875 --> 1:28:26.000
That's when I got the rest
of the team involved, mate.

1:28:26.083 --> 1:28:29.083
[upbeat music]

1:28:30.375 --> 1:28:32.708
They helped us supply the
money for the first four bags.

1:28:37.083 --> 1:28:39.583
And they loved the idea
of staging a stealing adventure

1:28:39.667 --> 1:28:41.000
for the Russians to watch too.

1:28:41.458 --> 1:28:42.792
And me, by the sound of it.

1:28:43.417 --> 1:28:44.708
So what did you actually steal?

1:28:48.083 --> 1:28:49.083
Nappies.

1:28:49.417 --> 1:28:51.208
Twelve big bags of nappies.

1:28:52.292 --> 1:28:53.625
How'd the police
go along with it?

1:28:53.917 --> 1:28:56.292
We've been after Demetri
and his goons for years

1:28:56.375 --> 1:28:57.750
but couldn't get
anywhere near him.

1:28:58.708 --> 1:29:01.625
We could've entrapped him, but
we're not allowed to do that.

1:29:02.458 --> 1:29:04.542
You two, on the other hand,
were causing mayhem.

1:29:04.583 --> 1:29:07.167
I just had to,
refocus your goals.

1:29:07.375 --> 1:29:08.792
I still can't believe it, man.

1:29:08.875 --> 1:29:10.625
Thank you so much
for everything.

1:29:10.708 --> 1:29:12.125
Listen, mate, forget it.

1:29:12.167 --> 1:29:13.958
I'm just glad it all
worked out in the end.

1:29:15.250 --> 1:29:16.875
And now for the last
piece of the puzzle.

1:29:17.958 --> 1:29:19.958
Here's all your money back
that you lost gambling.

1:29:20.000 --> 1:29:21.000
What? How?

1:29:21.083 --> 1:29:22.542
I got my 75 grand back.

1:29:22.625 --> 1:29:24.583
Because the police
recovered the stolen trainers

1:29:24.625 --> 1:29:26.708
the insurance company
paid a nice little reward.

1:29:27.375 --> 1:29:28.500
So this one's for you.

1:29:29.167 --> 1:29:30.708
I've got one for
someone else as well.

1:29:34.208 --> 1:29:35.958
Bet you're proud
of yourself, hey, Chris?

1:29:36.000 --> 1:29:37.708
Do you know how much
trouble you've caused

1:29:37.750 --> 1:29:40.250
-the footballing world?
-It's OK, babe.
Don't stress about him.

1:29:40.333 --> 1:29:42.542
He needs these little
moments to feel loved.

1:29:42.625 --> 1:29:44.375
Even if he shits on his friends.

1:29:44.417 --> 1:29:45.417
Oh, Marcel.

1:29:46.125 --> 1:29:47.708
One thing's been
bothering me for weeks

1:29:47.750 --> 1:29:49.625
about you now. As
much as I don't like you

1:29:49.667 --> 1:29:50.792
you're a damn good player.

1:29:51.417 --> 1:29:52.417
Better than you?

1:29:53.542 --> 1:29:55.083
Thank you, have a seat.

1:29:55.625 --> 1:29:58.042
You know I said, you're the only
one not in the fake robbery?

1:29:58.125 --> 1:29:59.542
There's someone else.

1:30:00.125 --> 1:30:01.167
Wasn't that, Marcel?

1:30:03.042 --> 1:30:05.125
See, as good as a
player as Marcel is

1:30:05.333 --> 1:30:06.708
he's yet to score a goal.

1:30:06.917 --> 1:30:08.500
And then there's tackling
your own teammate--

1:30:08.583 --> 1:30:10.125
Sorry, what are you insinuating?

1:30:10.333 --> 1:30:13.167
You've been taking
bribes to fix games from
the beginning, haven't you?

1:30:14.375 --> 1:30:15.375
Marcel Remi.

1:30:15.833 --> 1:30:19.125
I'm arresting you on
suspicion of fixing
matches for financial gain.

1:30:19.958 --> 1:30:21.458
Who's on tail, mate?

1:30:21.542 --> 1:30:23.333
-Do you want to translate that?
-You're next!

1:30:23.583 --> 1:30:24.583
Get off of him!

1:30:24.625 --> 1:30:27.667
[cheering and clapping]

1:30:31.042 --> 1:30:33.875
[loud cheering]
Chris! Chris!

1:30:34.125 --> 1:30:37.167
Ladies and gentlemen, if I can
have your attention, please.

1:30:37.250 --> 1:30:40.917
Um, I'd like to introduce you
to a very dear friend of mine.

1:30:41.458 --> 1:30:42.458
This is Josh.

1:30:43.500 --> 1:30:44.500
Josh.

1:30:45.000 --> 1:30:47.000
On behalf of East Stratford FC

1:30:47.708 --> 1:30:50.542
I give you, take this cheque
and spend it as you see fit.

1:30:51.500 --> 1:30:52.500
Thank you.

1:30:52.625 --> 1:30:55.458
[camera shutters]
[applause]

1:30:56.500 --> 1:30:57.500
Oh my gosh.

1:30:57.667 --> 1:31:00.042
We've just been handed a cheque
for 100 thousand pounds.

1:31:00.917 --> 1:31:02.083
Thank you, East Stratford.

1:31:02.583 --> 1:31:03.875
And thank you, Chris Rose.

1:31:04.250 --> 1:31:05.542
Chris, where are
you going, mate?

1:31:05.750 --> 1:31:07.542
Come back and party,
you've earned it, broth.

1:31:08.208 --> 1:31:09.292
Yeah, maybe, mate.

1:31:09.667 --> 1:31:10.667
But

1:31:10.792 --> 1:31:12.750
There's one thing I've
got to take care of first.

1:31:13.417 --> 1:31:14.458
See you in a bit, OK?

1:31:14.833 --> 1:31:15.833
All right.

1:31:15.917 --> 1:31:18.417
Thanks for everything, broth.
You've been a true pal you know?

1:31:20.542 --> 1:31:22.333
Oh, say hello to her
for me, won't you?

1:31:24.125 --> 1:31:26.500
[dramatic music]

1:31:27.208 --> 1:31:28.375
[cellphone rings]

1:31:28.792 --> 1:31:29.833
Hey, Chris, is that you?

1:31:30.583 --> 1:31:32.292
I've got a lot of
explaining I need to do.

1:31:33.042 --> 1:31:34.042
I need to see you.

1:31:34.208 --> 1:31:35.667
OK, yeah, sure, umm...

1:31:35.792 --> 1:31:36.792
I'll be right over.

1:31:37.083 --> 1:31:38.083
Ashley.

1:31:38.625 --> 1:31:39.708
I love you, babe.

1:31:41.917 --> 1:31:44.917
[dramatic music]

1:31:49.000 --> 1:31:50.250
Get in the car.

1:31:50.333 --> 1:31:53.333
[tense music]

1:31:56.000 --> 1:31:57.583
Excuse me, are you Chris Rose?

1:31:57.667 --> 1:31:58.667
Yeah, mate.

1:32:02.333 --> 1:32:03.333
[gunshot]

1:32:04.000 --> 1:32:05.000
[gunshot]

1:32:05.125 --> 1:32:08.167
[ending somber music]
