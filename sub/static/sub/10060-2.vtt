She's going to be married
to someone she barely knows.

00:22.041 --> 00:23.500
I'm not fuckin' ready.

You've bailed seven times,
don't make it eight!

Cool.

00:35.166 --> 00:37.458
Love is about sacrifice,
and destiny.

00:37.458 --> 00:40.625
You sacrificed Marnie
so she could find her destiny.

00:41.083 --> 00:42.208
I'm getting married today.

00:42.208 --> 00:43.208
It's all happening, gentlemen.

00:43.625 --> 00:45.500
The very least
you could do right now

00:45.500 --> 00:47.625

doing the right thing.

I just pushed it
against the wall

'cause I needed
room and space

01:51.583 --> 01:53.625
for the project
I'm working on.

01:53.625 --> 01:54.792
Uh, project?

01:54.792 --> 01:57.250
Yeah, I'm making
a map of my body

01:57.250 --> 02:00.708
because I realized
that every day I'm kind of
growing a little bit.

02:00.708 --> 02:03.041
Like, just a little bit,
but I can tell that there's
a difference.

02:03.041 --> 02:05.250
You can,
like, see it in my skin.
Like, look at all this skin.

02:05.250 --> 02:07.792
Like, a neck
shouldn't be like this.
This isn't normal.

02:07.792 --> 02:10.208
And I don't know
if it's part of just my skin
or if it's in my blood.

02:10.208 --> 02:11.667
( whispers )
Fran, he's crazy.

02:11.667 --> 02:13.834
- Wait,
what did you just say?
- He's crazy.

02:13.834 --> 02:16.417
- I get what's going on.
- What did your bitch
just fucking say to me?

02:16.417 --> 02:18.291
- You don't need to use
language like that, okay?
- He's fully insane.

02:18.291 --> 02:20.208
What did you just
fucking say to me?

02:20.208 --> 02:21.708
- I didn't say anything.
- You're bar mitzvah'd, man.

02:21.708 --> 02:22.959
I don't care
if I was bar mitzvah'd.

02:22.959 --> 02:24.375
I did not call you crazy.
I was saying--

02:24.375 --> 02:25.959
- I don't give a fuck!
- ( screams ) Ow!

02:25.959 --> 02:27.708
Whoa, okay.
You all right?

02:27.708 --> 02:29.375
Ow! It didn't touch me,
but it could have.

02:29.375 --> 02:31.083
- Why are you
talking about me?
- All right.

02:31.083 --> 02:32.500
Why did you say that I'm crazy?
What did you tell her?

02:32.500 --> 02:34.375
Take it easy.
Take it easy.

02:34.375 --> 02:37.000
I want to slow down.
I want to be the fucking
slowest in the world.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.834
But I'm like
a slow-motion
Incredible Hulk

02:38.834 --> 02:40.417

fucking Hulk out.

No, no, no, no.

02:42.125 --> 02:43.875

bush hanging out.

02:43.875 --> 02:45.375

in the fucking wind

02:45.375 --> 02:47.583
like a fucking
Bob Dylan concert.

02:47.583 --> 02:48.959
Well,
we just woke up, okay?

02:48.959 --> 02:50.500
I didn't pay her
to see her bush.

02:50.500 --> 02:51.959
- I understand.
- I'm not putting quarters

02:51.959 --> 02:53.458
onto a table to see
her fucking bush,

02:53.458 --> 02:55.417
- you understand?
- Yeah, yeah.

02:55.417 --> 02:57.917
And if I was doing that,
I would go in, I would
have mozzarella sticks,

02:57.917 --> 03:00.083
and I would go look
at a fucking bushy cooch.

03:00.083 --> 03:02.166
But I don't want
to fucking do that, okay?

03:02.166 --> 03:04.458
If it's making you
uncomfortable,

03:04.458 --> 03:06.500
- I will cover my bush.
- Don't--

03:06.500 --> 03:09.708
( music playing )

03:13.708 --> 03:15.875
( muffled )
I feel like you
got the bigger half.

03:15.875 --> 03:17.375
Well, if I did
my job right,

03:17.375 --> 03:20.500
then they should be
the exact same size, buddy.

03:20.500 --> 03:22.000
Sure it's okay
if I stay here?

03:22.000 --> 03:23.250
Yeah, of course.
What are you gonna do,

03:23.250 --> 03:25.041
like, get, like,
a seedy motel out by JFK?

03:25.041 --> 03:26.458
Mm-mm-mm.

03:26.458 --> 03:28.291

Jacob was doing good,

03:28.291 --> 03:30.458
taking his meds,
you know?

03:30.458 --> 03:32.333
I try and look out
for him, but...

03:32.333 --> 03:34.041
Listen, it's so sweet
of you to care,

03:34.041 --> 03:37.000
but he's fucking crazy.
Let's pretend he never existed.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.417
- Yeah.
- You're gonna be safe here.

03:42.041 --> 03:45.041

he had a growth, he was right.

03:45.041 --> 03:46.625
I'm not ashamed.

03:46.625 --> 03:48.959
Look, Fran,
the house rules
are simple, okay?

03:48.959 --> 03:50.917
Keep it sweet,
keep it sexy,

03:50.917 --> 03:52.959
keep that fridge stocked
with K-Mart-brand seltzer--

03:52.959 --> 03:54.917
it can be found
at Valley Stream,
Long Island.

03:54.917 --> 03:56.792
- Yeah, or it can
be LaCroix.
- LaCroix.

03:56.792 --> 03:58.208
What are you guys
doing up so early?

03:58.208 --> 04:00.375
Oh, are you going
to "work"?

04:00.375 --> 04:02.000
Stop putting it in quotes.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.750
It's a job.
You should try it.

04:03.750 --> 04:05.792
( stammers )
I work at Ray's, okay?

04:05.792 --> 04:07.667
That's like a job.

04:07.667 --> 04:10.458
Except it involves Ray
and I can't take my shirt off.

04:10.458 --> 04:11.875
You could take
your shirt off.

04:11.875 --> 04:13.500
I've taken both things
off there.

04:13.500 --> 04:15.041
I know,
but it's different
if you're a girl.

04:15.041 --> 04:17.500
Okay, buddy,
we gotta go.

04:17.500 --> 04:20.875
- I forgot to wear a bra.
- Well, just stick with it,
you know?

04:20.875 --> 04:22.667
8th-grade boys
are gonna love it.

04:22.667 --> 04:25.708
- Have a good day, baby.
- I love you. Mm.

04:27.208 --> 04:29.375
- ( giggles )
- Uh... ( chuckles )

04:31.125 --> 04:32.667
What, are we supposed
to not do this

04:32.667 --> 04:34.000
now that you're around?

04:34.000 --> 04:36.041
Mm.

04:36.041 --> 04:37.083
Maybe.

04:37.083 --> 04:38.417
We have a very specific
relationship

04:38.417 --> 04:39.792
and we have to be able
to express ourselves.

04:39.792 --> 04:41.542
We worked really hard
to get here.

04:41.542 --> 04:43.834
If you want to get in here,
we can see if we can figure
something out.

04:43.834 --> 04:46.500
- That's not what I meant.
- Well, that's what I meant.

04:46.500 --> 04:49.500
Oh, I mean, it's just
been incredible, Adam.

04:49.500 --> 04:51.333
Beyond my wildest dreams.

04:51.333 --> 04:52.959
You know,
I'm her mother,

04:52.959 --> 04:56.208
but she's my mother,
you know?

04:56.208 --> 04:57.417
What?

04:57.417 --> 04:58.750
Lovey, how's
my porridge coming?

04:58.750 --> 05:00.166
Uh, great, angel.

05:00.166 --> 05:02.000
Would you like
hemp or agave syrup?

05:02.000 --> 05:04.291
Laird, no agave.
Fuck agave.

05:04.291 --> 05:05.834
How many times
do I have to tell you?

05:05.834 --> 05:08.250
It is through the roof
on the glycemic index.

05:08.250 --> 05:11.041
- Throw it away.
- All right.

05:11.041 --> 05:12.458
Down the sink.
In front of my eyes.

05:12.458 --> 05:13.959
I want to see you
throw it away.

05:13.959 --> 05:15.208
Okay. God.

05:15.208 --> 05:17.291
- ( baby fussing )
- Take your time.

05:17.291 --> 05:19.458
Thank you.
Oh, yes.

05:19.458 --> 05:21.708
Okay, you're gonna
go see your uncle.

05:21.708 --> 05:23.917
- Yes, yes, yes.
- No, no, no.

05:23.917 --> 05:25.750
- Oh, yes.
- No, it's too small.

05:25.750 --> 05:28.708
Brother, I have
to take a shit.
There you go.

05:28.708 --> 05:30.834

05:30.834 --> 05:32.625
Laird:
Do you want
your porridge first?

05:32.625 --> 05:34.625
No, I don't want
my porridge first.

05:34.625 --> 05:36.917
And no knocking on this door
for 40 minutes, Laird. 40.

05:36.917 --> 05:38.917
( door closes )

05:41.667 --> 05:44.417
( baby babbling )

05:45.250 --> 05:47.458
Gotta give
a mother her time.

05:47.458 --> 05:49.333
Are you
getting any time?

05:49.333 --> 05:52.959
Oh, me?
No, I don't
deserve time.

05:52.959 --> 05:55.041
You know,
I'm not the one
who pushed a baby

05:55.041 --> 05:57.250
out the hole
next to my pee hole.

05:57.250 --> 05:59.750
You should
have one, huh?

05:59.750 --> 06:03.542
A baby, I mean,
not another pee hole.

06:03.542 --> 06:05.000
Yeah, maybe I will.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.792
Laird:
Oh, yeah?

06:06.792 --> 06:09.583
You got a little something
brewing on the ol' love front?

06:09.583 --> 06:12.583
- ( laughs )
- Uh--

06:12.583 --> 06:14.083
oh, uh, maybe.

06:14.083 --> 06:15.708
Do you ever
have feelings
for someone,

06:15.708 --> 06:20.667
but the situation
is, uh, complex?

06:20.667 --> 06:24.959
Uh, yeah, ever heard
of a little lady called
Hannah Horvath?

06:24.959 --> 06:26.792
( laughs )

06:26.792 --> 06:30.417
That, my friend,
was an issue of timing.

06:30.417 --> 06:32.291
Bad timing.

06:32.291 --> 06:34.000
Yeah, right around
when we met,

06:34.000 --> 06:37.792
she had just gone in
for, like, this big
vagina surgery.

06:40.166 --> 06:42.625
That's what
she told me,
at least.

06:44.875 --> 06:47.834
Ray:
The guy who just walked out
is wearing a monocle.

06:47.834 --> 06:49.959
Elijah:
There's a breast-feeding
section.

06:49.959 --> 06:51.959
What kind
of a fucking douchebag

06:51.959 --> 06:53.291
names their store
after a font?

06:53.291 --> 06:56.250
I know, right?
The coffee is so good.

06:57.750 --> 07:00.917
That place
is turning this shop
into a ghost town.

07:00.917 --> 07:02.959
Yeah, it's empty in here.

07:02.959 --> 07:05.166
All right, you can't
go there anymore.

07:05.166 --> 07:06.750
What? Why?

07:06.750 --> 07:08.834
Why do you think?
You work here now.

07:08.834 --> 07:11.208
They're the competition.
We don't fraternize
with the enemy.

07:11.208 --> 07:13.125
Think about it.

07:13.125 --> 07:14.500
Plus,
they don't use lids,

07:14.500 --> 07:16.333
which is not only
empirically terrible,

07:16.333 --> 07:18.708
but also forces people
to come here and steal
our lids.

07:18.708 --> 07:20.417
Yeah, but the coffee
is so good.

07:20.417 --> 07:22.000
- The coffee here is good.
- Is it?

07:22.000 --> 07:24.250
Yes, it is.
Listen carefully.

07:24.250 --> 07:25.458
You work here now.

07:25.458 --> 07:27.500
You drink my coffee.
Do you understand that?

07:27.500 --> 07:29.750
Do you have any idea
of what kind of a sign
this sends?

07:29.750 --> 07:31.959
When my employee starts
endorsing their product?

07:31.959 --> 07:33.750
Do you have any idea?

07:33.750 --> 07:35.166
Keep it
in your pants, okay?

07:35.166 --> 07:36.792
I'll just go there
to buy the beans.

07:36.792 --> 07:39.417
I can make
the coffee here.

07:41.834 --> 07:45.667
So then I got
my third DUI.

07:45.667 --> 07:47.333
And a normal person
would be like,

07:47.333 --> 07:49.041
"fuck drinking,"
at this point.

07:49.041 --> 07:52.208
Not me, I was like,
"Fuck driving."

07:52.208 --> 07:56.750
So I got a bike and I started
to ride my bike everywhere.

07:56.750 --> 08:00.000
Till I hit
that Polish kid.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.208
You'd think that a bike
couldn't do that kind
of damage,

08:03.208 --> 08:05.041
but he was messed up.

08:06.708 --> 08:08.834
- Hey!
- Jesus fucking Christ.

08:08.834 --> 08:11.000
- ( laughing ) Sorry.
- You cannot grab people
like that.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
Sorry.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.583
I thought
you were a murderer.

08:13.583 --> 08:15.208
( sighs )
Okay.

08:15.208 --> 08:17.708
No, no, no.
We should talk
about what happened.

08:17.708 --> 08:19.917
We most certainly
should not talk
about that.

08:19.917 --> 08:21.417
Yeah, we should.

08:21.417 --> 08:22.917
For our sobriety.

08:22.917 --> 08:24.208
You know what
we should do?

08:24.208 --> 08:25.625
We should pretend
like it never happened

08:25.625 --> 08:28.125
and then maybe even
never speak again.

08:28.125 --> 08:29.500
I don't want
to do that.

08:29.500 --> 08:31.083
Well, who asked you
what you want?

08:31.083 --> 08:32.542
You feel something
for me.

08:32.542 --> 08:33.625
I know it.

08:33.625 --> 08:35.082
You're hiding
behind your accent.

08:35.082 --> 08:37.542
- So what?
- So, we have to address it.

08:37.542 --> 08:39.082
What?
And then what?

08:39.082 --> 08:41.417
It doesn't matter
because nothing can
ever happen.

08:41.417 --> 08:42.582
Why not?

08:42.582 --> 08:43.833
Because...

08:43.833 --> 08:46.083
you stupid fucking--
you idiot!

08:46.083 --> 08:47.125
Because Hannah.

08:47.125 --> 08:48.625
She doesn't want
to be with me.

08:48.625 --> 08:50.625
It doesn't matter.
She's my friend.

08:50.625 --> 08:53.333
It's shitty,
and I'm done
being shitty.

08:53.333 --> 08:55.166
Shitty is old news.

08:55.166 --> 08:58.667
- We're friends.
- Yeah? So what?

08:58.667 --> 09:03.458
So can we just, uh,
be with each other
like, uh...

09:03.458 --> 09:05.125
friends?

09:06.750 --> 09:09.625
- Like follow me around?
- Yeah.

09:11.959 --> 09:13.083
Okay.

09:13.083 --> 09:17.000
Well, I have really
big plans today.

09:17.875 --> 09:20.625
Do you need help,
friend?

09:22.333 --> 09:24.917
Okay, so, the central conflict
of "Goodbye, Columbus,"

09:24.917 --> 09:28.166
besides whether
I am personally attracted
to Philip Roth or not,

09:28.166 --> 09:31.083
is the idea
that there's these,
like, chosen Jews

09:31.083 --> 09:34.750
and these lesser Jews,
and this class conflict
within a religion

09:34.750 --> 09:38.959
is keeping people
who love each other
from feeling safe together.

09:38.959 --> 09:40.500
Yes, Nellie?

09:40.500 --> 09:43.291
Um, should we really
be reading something
about birth control?

09:43.291 --> 09:46.500
Like, honestly,
this is basically
a how-to guide to sex.

09:46.500 --> 09:48.125
Yeah, you're welcome.

09:48.125 --> 09:49.792
Yeah, that's
inappropriate.

09:49.792 --> 09:51.875
- ( knock on door )
- Yeah?

09:53.083 --> 09:55.000
Miss Horvath,
there's an urgent
call for you

09:55.000 --> 09:56.417
in Principal Toby's
office.

09:56.417 --> 09:58.291
Urgent?
Who is it?

09:58.291 --> 10:00.125
I couldn't make out
the name, actually.

10:00.125 --> 10:01.625
He's--

10:01.625 --> 10:03.250
( whispers )
He's crying.

10:03.250 --> 10:05.333
Okay, Nellie, I'm gonna
leave you in charge

10:05.333 --> 10:07.417
because you have
a very authoritative presence,

10:07.417 --> 10:08.667
but I don't want you
to use this time

10:08.667 --> 10:10.500
to continue to preach
your agenda.

10:10.500 --> 10:12.333
Thanks.

10:12.333 --> 10:15.291
- Dad, is that you?
- ( Tad sobbing ) Hannah?

10:15.291 --> 10:17.458
What's going on, Dad?
I can't hear you.

10:17.458 --> 10:20.000
- ( Tad sobbing )
- What's happening
in the background?

10:20.000 --> 10:21.291
Is there, like,
a bad connection?

10:21.291 --> 10:23.166
Like, I really
can't hear you.

10:23.166 --> 10:25.083
I'm crying, Banana.

10:25.083 --> 10:26.875
Oh, okay.
So, where are you?

10:26.875 --> 10:30.125
I'm in the Marriott
in Times Square.

10:30.125 --> 10:33.417
- Room 1706.
- All right, I'll be
right there.

10:33.417 --> 10:34.750
I'll be right there.

10:34.750 --> 10:36.041
I'm sorry,
I was just--

10:36.041 --> 10:37.834
Yeah, could I see you
for a minute, please?

10:37.834 --> 10:40.041
Of course.

10:42.375 --> 10:45.542
I hear you're reading
"Goodbye, Columbus."

10:45.542 --> 10:47.417
Yes, I felt that
"Goodbye, Columbus"

10:47.417 --> 10:49.667
would be the best
Philip Roth for the kids.

10:49.667 --> 10:53.917
Uh-huh, because I feel
the best Philip Roth for kids

10:53.917 --> 10:55.708
is no Philip Roth.

10:55.708 --> 10:59.500
Principal Toby,
I really wasn't expecting you
to pile on me, too.

10:59.500 --> 11:01.417
I mean,
Nellie's an 8th grader.
I understand--

11:01.417 --> 11:05.041
Hannah, look.
I'm gonna tell you something,
teacher to teacher.

11:05.041 --> 11:06.708
- Okay.
- And it's something
that took me

11:06.708 --> 11:08.708
a long time to learn.

11:08.708 --> 11:11.458
Just because kids
can grasp the words

11:11.458 --> 11:14.083
doesn't mean they're ready
for the concepts.

11:14.083 --> 11:16.417
- Yes.
- So it's not a question

11:16.417 --> 11:18.750
of appropriate
versus inappropriate,

11:18.750 --> 11:20.583
but rather...

11:20.583 --> 11:24.250
what are we gaining
from having them read
this book now?

11:24.250 --> 11:27.041
I think they're gonna gain
a unique understanding

11:27.041 --> 11:29.083
of how Jewish men,
particularly in their 20s,

11:29.083 --> 11:30.959
are this just
very specific mix

11:30.959 --> 11:34.041
of sexual bravado
and extreme self-hatred,

11:34.041 --> 11:37.250
and it can be really
destructive to the girls
they choose to fuck.

11:38.500 --> 11:41.291
Yeah, okay, so maybe it is
a question of inappropriate.

11:41.291 --> 11:42.917
Principal Toby,

11:42.917 --> 11:45.625
I think I've told you
that my father is gay, yes?

11:45.625 --> 11:47.625
- Oh, yeah.
- So, he just called me

11:47.625 --> 11:49.458
from a Midtown
hotel room sobbing,

11:49.458 --> 11:52.708
and that leads me to believe
that something pretty invasive

11:52.708 --> 11:54.125
has happened to his body.

11:54.125 --> 11:56.166
So I feel like
I've gotta get there

11:56.166 --> 11:57.917
kind of on the quick.

11:57.917 --> 11:59.834
Yeah, okay.
I like you.

11:59.834 --> 12:01.834
I really like you.
And I think you--

12:01.834 --> 12:04.208
I like you, too.
You're one of the smartest
people I've ever met

12:04.208 --> 12:05.708
and so gentle and so kind,

12:05.708 --> 12:07.333
and I feel like we work
really well together,

12:07.333 --> 12:09.959
so just, you know,
have Shana check in
on my class

12:09.959 --> 12:12.125
and I'll be back ASAP.

12:14.917 --> 12:18.417
- ( music playing )
- ( chatter )

12:27.041 --> 12:29.583
How's it going, man?
How can I help you?

12:29.583 --> 12:31.583
I'm actually not here
for any coffee.

12:31.583 --> 12:34.667
I'm your business neighbor
from across the street there.

12:34.667 --> 12:36.667
What, that Starbucks?

12:36.667 --> 12:38.000
It's not a Starbucks.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.458
It's one
of two businesses

12:39.458 --> 12:41.667
operated by one
small business owner.

12:41.667 --> 12:43.250
Oh, okay.
Sorry.

12:43.250 --> 12:45.625
I kind of get the chains
confused sometimes, you know.

12:45.625 --> 12:47.875
It's, what, Ray's?

12:47.875 --> 12:50.125
And then Starbucks,
Caribou Coffee.

12:50.125 --> 12:51.500
There's Peet's Coffee.

12:51.500 --> 12:53.708
There's Cheesecake Factory.
They have coffee.

12:53.708 --> 12:55.417
Dunkin' Donuts
has their own coffee.

12:55.417 --> 12:56.875
Guy Fieri's
American Grill,

12:56.875 --> 12:59.333
Chili's, Applebee's,
Olive Garden.

12:59.333 --> 13:02.125
I mean, the list
goes on and on, right?

13:03.250 --> 13:04.792
Let me just tell you
why I'm here, okay?

13:04.792 --> 13:06.333
I'm here because
while you've decided

13:06.333 --> 13:09.792
to take some sort
of political stance
on lids,

13:09.792 --> 13:12.500
it appears to absolutely
no one's surprise

13:12.500 --> 13:14.333
that people
actually like lids.

13:14.333 --> 13:16.667
So what's happening
is people are coming here

13:16.667 --> 13:18.250
to purchase your coffee,

13:18.250 --> 13:20.542
then they're
crossing the street
and stealing my lids.

13:20.542 --> 13:22.542
That sucks.

13:22.542 --> 13:25.667
Indeed.
Indeed, it does suck.

13:25.667 --> 13:28.542
Would you like to put forth
any solutions to this problem?

13:28.542 --> 13:30.583
No.

13:30.583 --> 13:34.542
Here's one--
maybe you could just
put lids on your coffees.

13:34.542 --> 13:37.625
( laughing )

13:37.625 --> 13:39.500
Why are you laughing?

13:39.500 --> 13:40.875
It's-- it's just funny.

13:40.875 --> 13:42.375
It's just funny.
( chuckles )

13:42.375 --> 13:44.542
Would you care
to expound upon that, sir?

13:45.625 --> 13:48.083
Why'd you feel the need
to call me "sir"?

13:48.083 --> 13:49.583
What the fuck, man?

13:50.959 --> 13:55.250
Okay, I am so sorry.
When I-- I-- female?

13:55.250 --> 13:57.417
Oh, female?
You a biologist?

13:57.417 --> 14:00.291
You a biological centralist?
You a detective?

14:00.291 --> 14:02.750
Is that what you are?
'Cause we don't like biologists.

14:02.750 --> 14:05.542
We also don't like
detectives.

14:05.542 --> 14:07.083
What is going on here?

14:07.083 --> 14:09.041
( mock whimpers )
"What's going on here?"

14:09.041 --> 14:11.917
Uh, what's going on here
is that you offended
they, all right?

14:11.917 --> 14:14.583
And you offended me,
so I think it's best
that you leave.

14:14.583 --> 14:16.750
Can we get back
to the lids?

14:16.750 --> 14:18.500
White man?
Yeah.

14:18.500 --> 14:20.583
I think you need
to go, white man.

14:20.583 --> 14:22.583
White man.
White man.

14:22.583 --> 14:25.792
Yeah, white man!

14:25.792 --> 14:29.333
Thank you for saying
what I can't.

14:29.333 --> 14:32.250
I'm sorry.
That sucks.

14:32.250 --> 14:34.917
( chatter )

14:38.125 --> 14:40.625
Nice plans, freak.

14:40.625 --> 14:43.542
Uh, you don't
know my life.

14:43.542 --> 14:45.708
Heart and soul
at the end of a pole.

14:45.708 --> 14:47.792
All you have to--
everybody...

14:47.792 --> 14:49.166
Remember me?

14:49.166 --> 14:52.125
Jessa, I told you once,
I told you a million times,

14:52.125 --> 14:53.959
do not bother me at work.

14:53.959 --> 14:58.834
- Go to the institution--
- Robin, I want my $30
and I want it today.

14:58.834 --> 15:00.500
Let's go
for the middle one.

15:00.500 --> 15:02.125
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

15:02.125 --> 15:04.792
- Almost.
- Come on!

15:11.250 --> 15:12.792
It's only $30.
I don't mean to holler.

15:12.792 --> 15:14.834
If it's only $30,
we'll start on faith.

15:14.834 --> 15:18.041
Here, smell the mint?
Government!

15:18.041 --> 15:20.667
( laughs )
Nothing like a good joke.
Hey, he likes it.

15:26.542 --> 15:28.500
What?

15:30.333 --> 15:32.500
Thank you.
( laughs )

15:32.500 --> 15:33.583
More frogs!

15:33.583 --> 15:35.333
- Okay.
- More frogs!

15:35.333 --> 15:36.792
( laughs )

15:41.125 --> 15:42.750
I know how you do
everything.

15:42.750 --> 15:45.583
Like this one?

15:45.583 --> 15:47.000
- Ugh!
- ( laughs )

15:47.000 --> 15:48.500
He likes it.
He likes it.

15:48.500 --> 15:51.000
( laughing )

15:53.875 --> 15:55.000
( muffled )
No!

15:55.000 --> 15:59.500
One, two,
three, go!

16:00.542 --> 16:02.083
Whoo!

16:04.625 --> 16:06.250
Oh.

16:18.458 --> 16:20.083
( knock on door )

16:20.083 --> 16:22.041
Hannah:
Daddy?

16:23.542 --> 16:25.041
( knocks )

16:25.041 --> 16:26.750
I'm gonna
come in, okay?

16:26.750 --> 16:29.291
Tad:
Okay, Hannah.

16:29.291 --> 16:31.208
( door closes )

16:31.208 --> 16:32.834
Hi.

16:32.834 --> 16:34.500
- Hey, are you okay?
- Hey.

16:34.500 --> 16:35.750
Oh, yeah.
I'm good.

16:35.750 --> 16:37.542
What are you
doing here?

16:37.542 --> 16:39.792
Uh...

16:39.792 --> 16:42.917
I came to the city
to meet someone.

16:43.959 --> 16:47.875
Um, is it a man?
A male someone?

16:47.875 --> 16:49.583
Mm-hmm.

16:49.583 --> 16:52.750
Okay, um, and how
did that go?

16:52.750 --> 16:56.000
Well, I was doing
some e-mailing, right?

16:56.000 --> 16:59.834
And while I was
on the Internet,
I typed in the word "gay"...

16:59.834 --> 17:02.250
- Yeah. Okay.
- ...on the browser there,

17:02.250 --> 17:06.791
and the first thing
that came up was gay.com,
which was a dating site.

17:06.791 --> 17:10.040
Okay, so you typed
in "gay" into your browser
for no apparent reason.

17:10.040 --> 17:11.875
Well, I was looking
for porn sites.

17:11.875 --> 17:13.416
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

17:13.416 --> 17:17.165
But the point is,
I met someone online,

17:17.165 --> 17:20.750
and I decided to come
to the city and meet him
in person.

17:20.750 --> 17:22.375
Okay.

17:22.375 --> 17:24.458
Um, what happened?

17:24.458 --> 17:26.791
He didn't look anything
like his Internet photo.

17:26.791 --> 17:28.250
Yeah, well,
they never do.

17:28.250 --> 17:32.166
I mean, this guy,
he was sinister.

17:33.417 --> 17:35.166
His apartment
was so small...

17:35.166 --> 17:36.834
Okay, well, that's just
New York real estate.

17:36.834 --> 17:38.875
You can't judge someone
by how small their
apartment is.

17:38.875 --> 17:42.959
There was a purple couch--
it was all purple.

17:45.166 --> 17:46.959
And the dog--
this huge dog was--

17:46.959 --> 17:48.792
You know what?
I don't need every
little detail.

17:48.792 --> 17:50.291
I don't need to hear
about the nuance.

17:50.291 --> 17:52.792
I just want to know,
like, are you all right?

17:52.792 --> 17:54.667
( sobbing )

17:54.667 --> 17:58.250
What happened?

17:58.250 --> 18:01.458
I left my wallet.
( sobbing )

18:01.458 --> 18:03.708
That's okay.
You just call
the credit card company

18:03.708 --> 18:06.375
- and you get
new credit cards.
- I'm so stupid!

18:06.375 --> 18:09.125
You're not stupid.
I lose my wallet like
three times a month.

18:09.125 --> 18:12.667
My wallet must've
slipped out of my pants
when I took them off.

18:12.667 --> 18:14.792
Okay, don't tell me
that you took off
your pants!

18:14.792 --> 18:18.000
But, listen, I didn't want
to go back to get my wallet.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.959
I didn't know
who else to call.

18:19.959 --> 18:21.667
So you want me
to go back to the house

18:21.667 --> 18:23.583
of the guy
you just hooked up with
and get your wallet?

18:23.583 --> 18:24.917
Yeah.

18:24.917 --> 18:26.500
- ( phone chiming )
- Oh, my God.

18:26.500 --> 18:28.208
Please.

18:29.834 --> 18:32.667
Where does Mom
think you are?

18:32.667 --> 18:34.875
Where did you
tell her you are?

18:34.875 --> 18:37.917
Uh... Uncle Jeff's.

18:37.917 --> 18:39.959
Oh, my God.
Why'd you have to bring
Uncle Jeff into this?

18:39.959 --> 18:42.166
- I don't really know.
- Hi, Mom.

18:42.166 --> 18:44.917
Hannah, where the fuck
have you been?

18:44.917 --> 18:49.417
I have been at work,
and now I am in, uh--

18:49.417 --> 18:50.834
I'm with Dad.

18:50.834 --> 18:54.667
- What? Where is he?
- We're in Midtown.

18:54.667 --> 18:57.667
Oh, well, I'm surprised
he's not on Christopher Street

18:57.667 --> 18:59.458
drowning
in a pool of semen.

18:59.458 --> 19:00.917
God, Mom, please.

19:00.917 --> 19:02.708
- Is he near you?
- Yes, he is.

19:02.708 --> 19:05.291
Oh, good, good, good.
Can you give him a message
for me?

19:05.291 --> 19:09.000
- Mm-hmm.
- Tell him I want
a fucking divorce.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.667
Tell him that, Hannah.

19:13.875 --> 19:16.750
What'd she say?

19:16.750 --> 19:19.250
Let's just go get
your fucking wallet, okay?

19:30.083 --> 19:33.250
( distant dog barking )

19:38.625 --> 19:40.875
( knocking )

19:43.792 --> 19:45.417
Yeah, hello.
Can I help you?

19:45.417 --> 19:48.166
Yeah, my dad just left
his wallet here.

19:48.166 --> 19:51.792
He's, um-- he's the guy
you just hooked up with.

19:51.792 --> 19:53.792
( stammers )
Why, no.

19:53.792 --> 19:55.750
No, no.
We didn't--

19:55.750 --> 19:58.834
we just had
some wine, kissed.

19:58.834 --> 20:01.166
We-- we kissed.
Uh, I'm Keith.

20:01.166 --> 20:02.750
Okay, Keith, well,
I don't really know

20:02.750 --> 20:04.375
why my dad's wallet
would've fallen out
of the pants

20:04.375 --> 20:06.542
he says he was removing
if you just kissed,

20:06.542 --> 20:09.375
so I'm starting to feel
like I can't really trust
any of you people.

20:09.375 --> 20:11.417
And by "you people,"
I don't mean homosexuals.

20:11.417 --> 20:12.834
I mean white men over 50.

20:12.834 --> 20:14.542
So can I just please
have the wallet?

20:14.542 --> 20:15.542
Of course.

20:15.542 --> 20:17.667
Please come in.
Come in.

20:22.083 --> 20:23.417
Here you go.

20:23.417 --> 20:24.500
Thank you.

20:24.500 --> 20:27.000
- Um, yes, if you could...
- ( barks )

20:27.000 --> 20:28.708
...maybe say hi
to your father from me?

20:28.708 --> 20:32.834
Um, and let him know
that I got his name
off his ID

20:32.834 --> 20:34.792
and I friended him
on Facebook

20:34.792 --> 20:37.083
and that he can connect
with me there if he wants.

20:37.083 --> 20:42.041
Okay, you seem like--
you seem like a really
nice man, Keith.

20:42.041 --> 20:44.708
Well, you seem like
a nice young lady.

20:44.708 --> 20:46.959
Thank you.
What-- what do you do?

20:46.959 --> 20:50.000
Oh, I am a boot dealer.
I deal fine boots.

20:50.000 --> 20:53.792
And, uh, I can get you
a pretty good discount.

20:53.792 --> 20:57.959
Maybe.
That would-- that would
actually be great.

20:57.959 --> 21:00.625
Well, um...

21:00.625 --> 21:01.959
a pleasure.

21:01.959 --> 21:04.000
( dog barks )

21:04.000 --> 21:05.208
Who's that?

21:05.208 --> 21:06.917
Keith:
That's my Lois.

21:06.917 --> 21:08.792
She's really cute.
It's insane.

21:08.792 --> 21:11.333
She actually
looks like a toy.

21:11.333 --> 21:13.875
You should consider
putting her in catalogs.

21:16.333 --> 21:18.166
( clicks tongue )

21:18.166 --> 21:21.041
( chatter )

21:25.500 --> 21:29.667
( sighs )
So this was fine.
Thank you for coming.

21:29.667 --> 21:31.708
I'm gonna kiss you
good-bye now.

21:31.708 --> 21:33.875
No.
No, you're not.

21:33.875 --> 21:35.375
Because we are friends.

21:35.375 --> 21:37.583
Because you know
as well as I do

21:37.583 --> 21:39.417
that even if we could
be together,

21:39.417 --> 21:45.208
even if Hannah didn't exist,
that I would destroy you.

21:45.208 --> 21:46.500
And you would destroy me.

21:46.500 --> 21:48.083
We would destroy
each other.

21:48.083 --> 21:50.166
You know where
this ends up, right?

21:50.166 --> 21:53.125
With you in a body bag

21:53.125 --> 21:55.125
and me headed
to the border pregnant.

21:55.125 --> 21:57.625
- ( laughs )
- Seriously,
it would be a problem.

21:57.625 --> 21:58.792
It would be a problem.

21:58.792 --> 22:00.375
- It would.
- It would.

22:00.375 --> 22:01.708
Can you stop
copying me?

22:01.708 --> 22:02.875
Could you please
stop copying me?

22:02.875 --> 22:05.708
- Jesus Christ.
- Jesus Christ.

22:08.291 --> 22:10.208
Here's your fish.

22:10.208 --> 22:12.041
Ooh, fuck me.

22:12.041 --> 22:13.875
You see?
It's fucking dead.

22:13.875 --> 22:16.083
- Fucking God damn it.
- You see? You see?

22:16.083 --> 22:19.417
'Cause you shook it
all the way here
like an idiot.

22:19.417 --> 22:20.917
This is us.

22:20.917 --> 22:23.375
This is why we can't.

22:23.375 --> 22:25.000
( bag splatters )

22:25.000 --> 22:27.625
Look, can we--

22:27.625 --> 22:30.083
can we be together,
but not touch each other?

22:31.166 --> 22:32.959
Yeah, that's
the whole point.

22:32.959 --> 22:35.417
We are not gonna
touch each other.

22:39.083 --> 22:40.417
Mm.

22:42.917 --> 22:46.000
Don't look.
It breaks the rules.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.166
You don't look at me.
You're the f--

22:48.166 --> 22:51.458
( panting )
fuckin' pervert
in this house.

22:54.834 --> 22:56.625
Adam.

22:59.375 --> 23:02.834
New rules.

23:02.834 --> 23:05.000
( Jessa moaning )

23:16.542 --> 23:18.166
Hey, so, how's Fran?

23:18.166 --> 23:20.875
Oh, he's good.
We don't have to
talk about me.

23:20.875 --> 23:21.959
Well, no, I want to.

23:21.959 --> 23:23.959
He seems like
such a great guy.

23:23.959 --> 23:25.875
Yeah, he's really nice.

23:25.875 --> 23:27.792
Well, try and hold on
to him, will ya?

23:27.792 --> 23:30.375
Why does everybody
keep saying that to me?

23:30.375 --> 23:33.000
Like, I'm just gonna,
like, misplace him
like a pair of keys.

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
Well, in the past,
you've had trouble
making healthy choices.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.417
Okay, well, I wouldn't
really talk about healthy
choices if I were you,

23:38.417 --> 23:41.166
considering
you just had sex with
a complete stranger,

23:41.166 --> 23:42.333
probably unprotected.

23:42.333 --> 23:44.333
You probably
just barebacked all day.

23:47.500 --> 23:48.708
What?

23:48.708 --> 23:50.708
Dad, I was just being
provocative.

23:50.708 --> 23:53.041
You had unprotected sex
with Keith?

23:53.041 --> 23:55.291
- Oh, my God.
- He's a total rando.

23:55.291 --> 23:57.834
He's a boot dealer.
What's wrong with you?

23:57.834 --> 24:00.458
Well, I haven't had
to think about it
in a long time.

24:00.458 --> 24:02.375
I'm gonna use
the restroom, okay?

24:02.375 --> 24:04.667
Why don't you try
and stay alive?

24:08.708 --> 24:11.500
( machine grinding )

24:11.500 --> 24:13.166
( faintly )
Elijah.

24:13.166 --> 24:16.125
- Elijah!
- What? I can do no more
than I have done.

24:16.125 --> 24:19.166
- It's Horvath.
- What about my important
coffee work?

24:19.166 --> 24:22.000
It's not going anywhere.
Here.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.542
Hannah, I can't talk.
I'm at a job right now.

24:24.542 --> 24:26.375
It's really
more of a career.

24:26.375 --> 24:28.250
Hannah:
Elijah, I need you
to come here, okay?

24:28.250 --> 24:30.125
- It's an emergency.
- What?

24:30.125 --> 24:32.208
It's my dad.
He's really, really scared.

24:32.208 --> 24:33.708
Oh, shit,
it got gayer?

24:33.708 --> 24:35.417
Dad had unprotected
butt sex.

24:35.417 --> 24:37.083
Okay, okay.
Shh, shh, shh.

24:37.083 --> 24:38.417
- I'll text you
the address.
- Okay.

24:38.417 --> 24:39.875
I have to go.
Hannah's having

24:39.875 --> 24:41.500
a gay emergency
with her gay dad.

24:41.500 --> 24:43.041
Hey, hey, that's not
how work works!

24:43.041 --> 24:44.750
- ( door opens, closes )
- Hey!

24:53.250 --> 24:55.458
So, what are you gonna do?

24:55.458 --> 24:58.208
I have a flight home
in the morning.

24:58.208 --> 25:00.291
Where will you stay?

25:00.291 --> 25:03.041
- What do you mean?
- I mean, not with Mom.

25:03.041 --> 25:05.208
Of course,
in our house.

25:05.208 --> 25:08.667
Dad, you came to New York
to meet a man you found online.

25:08.667 --> 25:11.417
You can't
just go back to Mom's house
like nothing happened.

25:11.417 --> 25:14.417
Hannah, it's more complex
than you understand.

25:14.417 --> 25:17.750
- Stop saying that.
- Okay, but it's the truth.

25:17.750 --> 25:19.834
Well, maybe it's not
more complex, okay?

25:19.834 --> 25:21.917
Because Mom
wants a divorce.

25:25.417 --> 25:27.250
What?

25:28.417 --> 25:29.917
( quietly )
She said that, okay?

25:29.917 --> 25:31.583
She doesn't want
to be married to you anymore.

25:31.583 --> 25:33.542
She didn't say that.

25:38.708 --> 25:40.000
( groans )

25:40.000 --> 25:43.083
( car alarm blaring )

25:50.458 --> 25:52.417
( both sobbing )

25:52.417 --> 25:54.792
Oh, no way,
Cosette.

25:57.750 --> 26:00.625
( music playing )

26:03.083 --> 26:05.166
Oh, thank you,
but I didn't order this.

26:05.166 --> 26:06.917
I know.
He did.

26:10.333 --> 26:12.458
What?

26:12.458 --> 26:14.625
I can't believe Dill Harcourt
bought me a drink.

26:14.625 --> 26:16.166
He's my number one
news source.

26:16.166 --> 26:18.875
He's everyone's
news source.
No shit.

26:18.875 --> 26:21.291
I watch the news to him
twice a day.

26:24.458 --> 26:26.291
You mind
if I join you?

26:26.291 --> 26:29.041
Uh, I wouldn't think
you needed to ask.

26:29.041 --> 26:30.500
( chuckles )

26:30.500 --> 26:33.333
Well, it's good to maintain
the illusion of normalcy.

26:35.750 --> 26:37.375
Well, I gave up on that
a long time ago,

26:37.375 --> 26:39.208
but for different reasons.

26:41.166 --> 26:44.166
- Elijah.
- Dill.

26:46.208 --> 26:48.375
- Oh... ( laughs )
- He's so great.

26:48.375 --> 26:50.834
- He is great.
- You didn't know that?

26:55.708 --> 27:00.083
So, I'm gonna go...

27:00.083 --> 27:01.708
downtown.

27:07.083 --> 27:09.250
I'm going uptown.

27:12.083 --> 27:14.667
It was very nice
to meet you.

27:23.625 --> 27:25.500
Get home safe.

27:32.041 --> 27:34.250
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
Fuck! Fuck!

27:34.250 --> 27:36.667
Fuck!
What the fuck?

27:36.667 --> 27:38.417
"I'm going downtown."
Fucking stupid.

27:38.417 --> 27:41.208
I deserve to die.
I just want to stab
myself in the heart.

27:47.166 --> 27:49.208
