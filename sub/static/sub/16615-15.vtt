<i>Previously on "Once
Upon a Time"...</i>

00:02.377 --> 00:04.123
Agrabah is in terrible danger.

00:04.129 --> 00:06.830
I wish for you to take us to Agrabah.

00:06.899 --> 00:09.232
We have to stop hiding
things from each other.

00:09.334 --> 00:11.568
I'm not the man she needs me to be.

00:11.670 --> 00:13.637
I was hoping you might
have room for one more.

00:13.705 --> 00:15.116
- [Klaxon blaring]
- We're... submerging, Captain.

00:15.140 --> 00:15.972
I didn't give that order.

00:16.074 --> 00:17.574
But <i> I</i> did.

00:22.436 --> 00:23.435
You okay, Dad?

00:23.441 --> 00:24.177
I don't know.

00:24.183 --> 00:28.185
So... Hook, he... killed my father?

00:28.253 --> 00:30.620
Okay, that's a little tough to process.

00:30.689 --> 00:33.423
I was hoping I wouldn't
have to tell you.

00:33.525 --> 00:35.225
Where the hell is Hook anyway?

00:35.327 --> 00:37.038
He didn't have the guts to
come and tell me himself?

00:37.062 --> 00:38.134
There's more.

00:38.140 --> 00:41.127
Hook... he... left town.

00:41.133 --> 00:42.566
What?

00:42.634 --> 00:45.068
We had a big fight
about him hiding this,

00:45.137 --> 00:48.138
and I told him if he wasn't
ready to trust me, that...

00:48.240 --> 00:50.040
that we shouldn't talk for a while,

00:50.142 --> 00:51.041
so I guess he wasn't ready,

00:51.143 --> 00:52.543
because Leroy saw him on the docks,

00:52.578 --> 00:57.013
and he got on the <i> Nautilus</i>
and just... sailed away.

00:57.149 --> 00:59.516
Emma, I'm so sorry.

00:59.618 --> 01:01.218
[Sighs] Thanks, Dad.

[Electrical crackling]

[Indistinct shouting]

01:35.487 --> 01:36.586
Is everyone okay?!

01:38.624 --> 01:40.190
Nemo!

01:40.292 --> 01:42.259
You can let go. I'm fine.

01:42.361 --> 01:43.693
Hook: What the hell happened?

01:43.795 --> 01:46.096
We just portaled into another realm.

01:46.198 --> 01:47.438
Usually we secure things first,

01:47.499 --> 01:49.532
but your friend gave us no warning.

01:49.635 --> 01:52.335
I assure you... Gideon is not my friend.

01:52.437 --> 01:53.970
I have no idea why he wants me gone,

01:54.039 --> 01:55.805
but I have to get back to Emma.

01:55.907 --> 01:57.016
We have to turn around.

01:57.022 --> 01:58.789
We're headed back to Storybrooke.

01:59.044 --> 02:00.310
That's not possible, brother.

02:00.412 --> 02:01.945
Like hell it isn't.

02:02.054 --> 02:05.059
Nemo just said that the <i>
Nautilus</i> can travel between realms.

02:05.095 --> 02:07.862
But to do that requires
something we don't have...

02:09.554 --> 02:11.087
Kraken's blood.

02:11.189 --> 02:13.723
And Gideon used the last of it.

02:14.983 --> 02:16.226
I'm sorry, Killian.

02:16.328 --> 02:18.695
"Sorry" isn't good enough.

02:18.764 --> 02:21.331
Emma's in danger. She <i>
thinks</i> that I've abandoned her.

02:21.433 --> 02:23.199
I have to get back
and tell her the truth.

02:23.302 --> 02:25.035
Did you not hear the Captain?

02:25.137 --> 02:26.803
We have no Kraken's blood.

02:28.340 --> 02:31.374
Well, you know who does? A Kraken!

02:31.476 --> 02:33.443
Nemo: You can't be serious.

02:33.545 --> 02:35.812
I spent a lifetime running <i>
away</i> from those beasts.

02:35.914 --> 02:37.747
Then they won't know to expect us.

02:38.917 --> 02:41.751
Gentlemen... let's go hunting.

Synced and corrected by Octavia

03:00.339 --> 03:02.639
Are we done searching yet?

03:02.741 --> 03:05.243
You can ask the same
question a hundred times

03:05.249 --> 03:06.876
and you will get the same answer...

03:06.882 --> 03:08.812
we search until we find Agrabah.

03:08.880 --> 03:12.248
We've been searching for
days. I'm hungry. I'm cold.

03:12.351 --> 03:15.352
And I'm really more built
for the desert, you know?

03:15.454 --> 03:17.354
Let's just admit it...
the wish, it didn't work.

03:17.456 --> 03:19.289
It might have worked.

03:19.358 --> 03:21.669
It took us to an empty field in
the middle of the Magic Forest.

03:21.693 --> 03:22.525
<i>Enchanted</i> Forest.

03:22.627 --> 03:24.194
I don't care what you call it.

03:24.296 --> 03:26.496
Agrabah isn't here!

03:26.598 --> 03:28.298
[Panting]

03:29.368 --> 03:31.468
I guess what they say
about wishes is true.

03:31.570 --> 03:33.603
There's always a catch,
always a price to pay.

03:35.974 --> 03:37.006
Jasmine.

03:38.910 --> 03:40.610
I think it's time we go home.

03:40.712 --> 03:43.546
In case you haven't been paying
attention, I have no home!

03:43.648 --> 03:47.684
No. I know. I-I meant you can
make a new one in Storybrooke.

03:47.786 --> 03:49.386
I mean, it's not such a bad place.

03:49.488 --> 03:50.488
Hey.

03:50.589 --> 03:52.155
They're nice people...

03:52.257 --> 03:53.923
like, you know...

03:54.225 --> 03:55.392
me.

03:55.527 --> 03:56.760
[Chuckles]

03:56.862 --> 03:57.862
Jasmine.

03:59.331 --> 04:00.797
I can't.

04:00.899 --> 04:02.031
I'm sorry.

04:03.168 --> 04:04.634
Come on, Princess.

04:04.736 --> 04:06.903
How many times are you
<i>almost</i> gonna kiss me?

04:07.005 --> 04:08.571
I mean, what are you so afraid of?

04:08.673 --> 04:10.473
[Scoffs] I'm not afraid.

04:10.575 --> 04:13.777
And you... have a very
high opinion of yourself.

04:13.783 --> 04:16.094
- Now, please, just, let's... go.
- Jasmine, j...

04:18.350 --> 04:20.016
Where did that come from?

04:20.118 --> 04:21.718
Um, from your pocket.

04:23.255 --> 04:25.221
I never had that before.

04:26.258 --> 04:28.258
The wish must have put it in there.

04:30.662 --> 04:32.562
What's wrong? What is that?

04:32.631 --> 04:34.764
The price of the wish.

04:34.833 --> 04:35.865
You were right.

04:37.369 --> 04:39.669
The wish didn't give me Agrabah.

04:39.738 --> 04:42.906
The wish gave me a reminder
of how I <i> failed</i> Agrabah.

04:46.445 --> 04:48.211
[Inhales, exhales sharply]

04:50.449 --> 04:51.449
And now...

04:52.918 --> 04:54.717
I know what I have to do.

05:00.592 --> 05:04.260
I give you the greatest
crown jewel in Agrabah.

05:04.329 --> 05:09.098
And for the lucky prince
who marries my daughter,

05:09.167 --> 05:11.601
this shall be her dowry.

05:11.670 --> 05:15.405
That is... quite a prize indeed.

05:15.507 --> 05:18.641
Do you mean me... or the diamond?

05:18.743 --> 05:20.076
Does it matter?

05:20.178 --> 05:21.811
So you can all leave now.

05:21.913 --> 05:23.813
There will be no engagement today.

05:23.915 --> 05:26.049
[Sultan laughs]

05:26.151 --> 05:28.651
Jasmine, please.

05:30.722 --> 05:32.889
I know you want to marry for love.

05:34.493 --> 05:36.025
Shouldn't everyone?

05:36.127 --> 05:39.329
For a princess, duty comes first.

05:39.431 --> 05:41.631
Jafar is threatening Agrabah.

05:41.733 --> 05:44.234
We need a prince... with an army.

05:44.336 --> 05:48.438
We need a hero, and I already found one.

05:48.507 --> 05:50.206
- His name is Aladdin.
- [Door opens]

05:50.242 --> 05:54.010
But Aladdin is a hero no longer.

05:54.079 --> 05:58.248
He fought way too many
battles, and now is broken.

05:59.424 --> 06:02.466
And these spoiled little princes,

06:02.833 --> 06:05.154
well, they'll never fill his shoes.

06:05.257 --> 06:07.056
And who is this,

06:07.187 --> 06:09.688
that would dare insult Prince Achmed?!

06:11.329 --> 06:13.063
Well, no one, really.

06:14.065 --> 06:19.235
Just a bastard child
from lower Agrabah...

06:19.337 --> 06:20.803
who's always wondered

06:20.906 --> 06:24.140
what it would be like to be a prince.

06:24.242 --> 06:25.041
[Vial shatters]

06:25.110 --> 06:27.977
- Aaaaaah!
- [Onlookers gasp]

06:30.515 --> 06:32.282
[Laughs]

06:35.287 --> 06:37.987
Your father is right to marry you off.

06:39.524 --> 06:41.824
But not to <i> these</i> cowards.

06:43.194 --> 06:46.596
No... I'm afraid the only
way to save your kingdom...

06:51.002 --> 06:52.035
is to marry me.

06:52.137 --> 06:54.437
That... will never happen.

06:55.740 --> 06:58.374
Well, that is entirely your choice.

06:58.443 --> 07:01.644
Either you marry me by sundown,

07:01.713 --> 07:03.913
or Agrabah will be destroyed.

07:12.757 --> 07:14.624
Aladdin: This is why
I live in the desert.

07:14.726 --> 07:16.960
Too much water makes me nervous.

07:17.062 --> 07:18.661
Just a little further.

07:18.730 --> 07:20.330
Then I'll wish you free...

07:20.432 --> 07:21.664
and dump this lamp so deep,

07:21.733 --> 07:23.333
it doesn't hurt anyone ever again.

07:23.435 --> 07:25.435
I think this is far enough.

07:25.503 --> 07:29.172
If the water gets rough,
we're too far away from shore.

07:29.240 --> 07:32.008
And, in case you've
forgotten, we can't swim.

07:32.077 --> 07:34.944
I'm not sure if that's
fear talking or laziness.

07:35.046 --> 07:36.579
Give me the oars.

07:36.615 --> 07:38.081
Jasmine, duck.

07:38.183 --> 07:40.016
Where?!

07:40.118 --> 07:41.118
Duck!

07:42.921 --> 07:45.154
What the hell is that?!

07:45.256 --> 07:48.124
I once read about it in a book,
but I can't remember the name!

07:48.226 --> 07:51.060
Never mind! I don't care
what it's called! Just hit it!

07:51.162 --> 07:53.663
[Both grunting]

07:56.301 --> 07:57.301
Aah!

08:00.772 --> 08:02.772
[Kraken growling]

08:09.881 --> 08:12.382
Captain Hook!

08:12.484 --> 08:15.218
Well, I guess there <i> is</i>
good luck when you need it.

08:15.320 --> 08:17.220
What are you doing in
the Enchanted Forest?

08:17.322 --> 08:19.088
Trying to get the hell out of it.

08:19.190 --> 08:21.924
Now climb aboard before
you get yourselves killed.

08:32.429 --> 08:34.967
I can't believe none of
this was ever digitized.

08:34.972 --> 08:36.373
Well, most of these files

08:36.408 --> 08:39.075
were created with Dark
Curse technology, so...

08:39.177 --> 08:41.177
Time to fix it.

08:41.246 --> 08:42.946
If busywork helps, busywork it is.

08:43.048 --> 08:44.114
It is not busywork.

08:44.182 --> 08:46.583
It is necessary, and it
beats chasing down dwarfs.

08:46.685 --> 08:47.851
Debatable.

08:47.953 --> 08:50.020
I've got just the thing
to mend a broken heart.

08:50.122 --> 08:51.299
Whatever spell that is, I don't want it.

08:51.323 --> 08:52.734
I'm seriously not in the mood for magic.

08:52.758 --> 08:54.491
Well, who said anything about magic?

08:56.194 --> 08:59.229
It's a 2-for-1 drink
coupon at that new pub.

08:59.331 --> 09:00.331
Aesop's Tables.

09:00.399 --> 09:01.598
It'd be a shame to waste it.

09:01.667 --> 09:03.611
Really? You think half-priced
liquor is the way to go?

09:03.635 --> 09:06.202
I certainly do. We need
a ladies' night out.

09:06.304 --> 09:08.872
Me, Emma and... Snow.

09:09.574 --> 09:11.241
Remember she's in a sleeping curse?

09:11.343 --> 09:12.909
She's at home asleep.

09:12.978 --> 09:14.644
Well, she doesn't have to be asleep.

09:17.616 --> 09:19.282
Oh, come on. I just woke up.

09:21.620 --> 09:23.386
I guess she doesn't have to be asleep.

09:26.958 --> 09:29.459
I can't. I'm about to go on patrol.

09:29.561 --> 09:31.272
And shouldn't you be
trying to break that curse?

09:31.296 --> 09:34.664
Well, I'm working on it,
but I could use a break.

09:34.733 --> 09:35.965
We all could.

09:36.068 --> 09:37.300
[Sighs]

09:37.402 --> 09:38.868
I know you're hurting.

09:38.937 --> 09:41.271
And I know you're trying
to hide it because you're...

09:42.140 --> 09:43.573
Emma.

09:43.675 --> 09:45.408
But you can't just run from this.

09:45.477 --> 09:48.111
I didn't run. Hook ran.

09:48.146 --> 09:50.013
So, there's nothing more to say.

09:59.391 --> 10:01.191
The Kraken destroyed
our starboard propeller.

10:01.293 --> 10:03.571
Liam, take Martin and Harris
and get on repairs. Let's go.

10:03.595 --> 10:05.075
Liam: You heard the captain. Come on!

10:07.466 --> 10:08.865
Wonderful.

10:08.934 --> 10:10.534
You both have made a
bloody mess of this.

10:10.569 --> 10:13.803
Have you got any idea
how rare a Kraken is?!

10:13.839 --> 10:16.539
I need its blood to get back
to Emma. She's in danger.

10:16.608 --> 10:19.909
And now... now I've got no
way of getting back home!

10:24.649 --> 10:25.782
Unless, of course...

10:27.819 --> 10:29.886
Unless you lend me one of your wishes.

10:29.955 --> 10:31.654
A wish won't get you back to Emma.

10:31.757 --> 10:32.767
They never work how you want.

10:32.791 --> 10:34.924
I mean, we never even found Agrabah.

10:36.361 --> 10:40.029
So now we're all separated from home.

10:40.098 --> 10:41.664
You got any idea who took yours?

10:41.767 --> 10:43.967
- We don't have a clue.
- Jafar.

10:44.035 --> 10:45.488
Wait. What?

10:45.494 --> 10:47.036
It was... Jafar.

10:47.105 --> 10:49.839
- But you said with...
- I know what I said.

10:49.908 --> 10:51.819
I should have told you the
whole story, and I'm sorry.

10:51.843 --> 10:53.243
Sorry's not the half of it.

10:53.311 --> 10:54.744
If Jafar took Agrabah,

10:54.813 --> 10:56.324
why the hell aren't
we looking for Jafar?

10:56.348 --> 10:57.981
Because I can't face him again!

11:01.553 --> 11:04.621
He ripped away everything
that I cared about...

11:04.723 --> 11:07.690
my home, my father, my people.

11:07.793 --> 11:11.161
So forgive me if I'm...

11:11.229 --> 11:12.729
afraid of him.

11:12.798 --> 11:15.331
Hell, he scares me, too.

11:16.535 --> 11:17.967
It doesn't matter.

11:18.036 --> 11:20.904
We can't find Jafar any more
than we can find Agrabah.

11:20.972 --> 11:24.574
Actually... that's not quite true, love.

11:25.944 --> 11:29.813
Jafar... he's a man with
revenge in his heart, yes?

11:29.915 --> 11:30.947
Well, on this ship...

11:33.351 --> 11:35.451
we have something to find such a man.

11:37.556 --> 11:38.966
What about getting back to Storybrooke?

11:38.990 --> 11:41.758
This <i> is</i> my way back.

11:41.827 --> 11:43.359
I've heard that Jafar is quite handy

11:43.461 --> 11:44.627
at traveling between realms.

11:44.696 --> 11:46.729
And you think he's just
gonna do you a favor?

11:47.632 --> 11:50.667
I think I'm pretty good
at convincing people.

11:50.769 --> 11:52.402
With any luck, we'll all get back home.

11:52.504 --> 11:54.137
What do you say, Princess?

11:55.473 --> 11:58.741
Hey. You have nothing to fear.

11:58.844 --> 12:01.077
This time you won't
have to face him alone.

12:03.849 --> 12:05.515
Well, then...

12:05.584 --> 12:08.475
perhaps Agrabah has
found its hero at last.

Hey, I was called here about a fight?

13:33.045 --> 13:35.079
I'm assuming it was these guys?

13:35.114 --> 13:37.092
I've been here all day. I didn't
see any kind of fight, Sheriff.

13:37.116 --> 13:38.716
Are you sure you got the right bar?

You two called in a fake fight?

Fake fight. Real friends.

13:47.526 --> 13:48.759
We're worried about you, Emma.

13:48.828 --> 13:50.694
You have to stop holding everything in.

13:50.763 --> 13:53.940
Regina's so right. Have
you tried these drinks?

13:53.946 --> 13:58.015
They're supposedly "artisanal,"
which, I think, means "strong".

13:58.337 --> 13:59.370
How many has she had?

13:59.472 --> 14:01.205
If you can believe it, that's her first.

Does it help?

Staring into the sea?

14:21.694 --> 14:24.295
How long have you been watching me?

14:24.363 --> 14:26.597
Long enough to recognize that look.

14:26.699 --> 14:28.365
And what look would that be?

14:29.735 --> 14:31.535
The look of someone who misses home.

But you're right.

14:47.486 --> 14:50.888
I do miss that patch
of dirt we called home.

14:50.956 --> 14:54.191
And every moment... I stay here...

14:54.293 --> 14:56.160
is killing me.

14:56.228 --> 14:57.328
I'm sorry.

And the thoughts of the
person that you love,

15:00.032 --> 15:02.132
not knowing how you truly feel...

15:02.234 --> 15:04.101
It's the hardest thing in the world.

15:06.772 --> 15:09.106
Never mind. Forget I said that.

15:10.876 --> 15:13.944
What's with you and Aladdin anyway?

15:14.013 --> 15:17.047
You don't think he's good
enough for a princess?

15:17.116 --> 15:19.983
Actually, it's the other way around.

15:20.052 --> 15:22.853
I've made some terrible
mistakes, you know.

15:22.922 --> 15:28.359
A princess has a duty to her
people and... I failed them.

15:28.427 --> 15:30.027
So there's just no point in it.

15:32.198 --> 15:36.667
After all that I've done...
I don't really deserve love.

was the coward's answer.

15:52.184 --> 15:54.284
Then I suppose I am a coward.

And maybe I always have been.

were looking for a prince?

17:39.291 --> 17:40.491
Yes.

Well, I-I accidentally
fell in love with a human.

He said he was traveling to Agrabah,

And this human prince,
does he have a human army?

A navy. Is... that the same thing?

17:57.409 --> 17:58.842
That's close enough.

17:58.944 --> 18:02.045
So I think there's a way that
we can both help each other.

18:02.114 --> 18:03.881
You're not afraid of heights, are you?

18:12.224 --> 18:15.292
If this is heights, then,
yes, I'm afraid of them.

18:15.327 --> 18:16.994
Why is this rug flying?

18:17.062 --> 18:19.429
It's a carpet. A magic carpet.

18:19.465 --> 18:23.367
It's clearly a rug, but
whatever it is, put it down.

18:23.435 --> 18:25.903
Not until we find your prince.

have terrible communication.

I don't really care right now.

was worse than we thought.

We're taking on water.

20:01.600 --> 20:02.811
Then we suit up and abandon ship.

20:02.835 --> 20:04.501
The dive room is already underwater.

20:04.603 --> 20:05.702
We can't get to it.

20:05.771 --> 20:07.771
You two can give up if you want,

20:07.840 --> 20:09.915
but I will not die in an
underwater coffin when there's

20:09.921 --> 20:12.379
- an island there that we can go to.
- Enough!

20:13.112 --> 20:16.213
A captain knows when his vessel is lost.

20:16.315 --> 20:18.749

spend your last few moments

20:18.851 --> 20:20.951

but <i> not</i> in conflict.

take us to that island.

I know you want me to open up,

21:54.047 --> 21:56.147

rather be distracted,

excellent distraction from...

24:09.415 --> 24:11.148
Aladdin: Who's Ariel?

24:11.250 --> 24:12.583
It <i> is</i> you.

24:12.652 --> 24:14.151
I knew it the minute I saw the forks.

24:14.220 --> 24:15.920
Oh, yeah. Sorry about the booby trap.

24:15.988 --> 24:18.389
Eric's away visiting some
of his land-lubber friends,

24:18.491 --> 24:20.257
and, well, I like to
protect my collection.

24:20.359 --> 24:21.392
[Chuckles]

24:21.494 --> 24:22.827
Welcome to Hangman's Island.

24:22.895 --> 24:24.895
Yeah, that was terrifyingly effective.

24:24.964 --> 24:27.298
I'm Aladdin. I'm guessing
you know each other?

24:27.400 --> 24:29.366
Yes, in various ways.

24:29.435 --> 24:31.068
Jasmine and I go back a long time.

24:31.103 --> 24:32.670
Yes.

24:32.705 --> 24:35.639
And once again, I fear I need your help.

24:44.483 --> 24:46.016
Well... [Chuckles]

24:46.085 --> 24:48.352
that was an interesting
thing I'll never do again.

24:48.454 --> 24:49.097
Mm-hmm.

24:49.103 --> 24:50.788
Let's go get your prince...

24:50.890 --> 24:52.223
and his navy.

24:52.325 --> 24:53.991
Or we could just circle one more time.

24:54.093 --> 24:55.459
What's wrong?

24:55.561 --> 24:57.895
He's right in there.

24:57.964 --> 25:00.764
Jasmine... we just had
a single night at a party.

25:00.867 --> 25:02.333
He won't remember me.

25:02.435 --> 25:05.436
Your story... a mermaid
meets a prince at a ball.

25:05.504 --> 25:08.172
It's like something out of Scheherazade.

25:08.241 --> 25:11.208
And that kind of thing
is <i> always</i> true love.

25:11.310 --> 25:13.077
If you miss another chance with him,

25:13.145 --> 25:15.012
you'll regret it forever.

25:15.081 --> 25:17.514
That sounds like the
voice of bitter experience.

25:18.085 --> 25:19.516
Perhaps.

25:19.619 --> 25:22.953
But there's nothing standing
in the way for <i> you.</i>

25:23.055 --> 25:24.321
Ariel...

25:24.423 --> 25:27.825
I look at what you've
already done and I'm amazed.

25:27.894 --> 25:30.160
You come from a world that's all water.

25:30.229 --> 25:32.863
And here you are, in the desert,

25:32.965 --> 25:35.432
being so incredibly strong.

25:35.501 --> 25:38.068
You deserve whatever
your heart is set on.

25:38.170 --> 25:39.170
Now go get it!

25:39.205 --> 25:40.371
[Chuckles]

25:51.751 --> 25:52.816
Eric?

25:56.222 --> 25:57.721
[Sighs] My God! Ariel!

25:57.823 --> 25:59.123
[Chuckles]

25:59.158 --> 26:00.708
I thought you'd changed
your mind about me.

26:00.714 --> 26:03.448
No, I-I was just... scared.

26:05.395 --> 26:06.797
I'm a mermaid.

26:06.866 --> 26:08.599
And I'm sorry I didn't tell you,

26:08.701 --> 26:10.100
but...

26:10.202 --> 26:11.335
I am now.

26:12.936 --> 26:14.836
And I hope that you can accept me

26:14.842 --> 26:17.378
for who I am or... am around water.

26:17.543 --> 26:18.575
[Chuckles lightly]

26:18.678 --> 26:20.411
Well...

26:20.479 --> 26:22.046
this is me.

26:23.883 --> 26:25.716
Of course I accept you.

26:25.818 --> 26:28.953
I was bored with regular girls.

26:29.021 --> 26:30.988
And I have a great
love for your people...

26:32.391 --> 26:33.824
especially poached...

26:36.495 --> 26:38.395
with lemon and capers.

26:39.565 --> 26:42.366
[Laughs evilly]

26:42.468 --> 26:43.701
Jafar!

26:43.769 --> 26:45.202
Ariel, this isn't Eric.

26:45.304 --> 26:48.505
He's not your man, and he's not my hero.

26:48.607 --> 26:50.407
True.

26:50.509 --> 26:51.542
But at it looks as though

26:51.610 --> 26:54.078
none are coming to your aid.

26:54.180 --> 26:57.915
There is only one path
to protecting Agrabah,

26:58.017 --> 27:01.752
and it leads you and me to the altar.

27:03.289 --> 27:05.189
Although you might have
thought of another way,

27:05.291 --> 27:08.492
but you've burned so much
time searching for this hero,

27:09.091 --> 27:11.662
I'm afraid time has run out.

27:11.764 --> 27:14.565
I promised you until sundown.

27:14.667 --> 27:16.266
Take the next ten minutes,

27:16.369 --> 27:19.260
and let the rest of your hopes die out.

27:26.271 --> 27:27.386
Ariel: This is the only thing

27:27.392 --> 27:29.489
in my collection that
looks remotely Agraban.

27:29.648 --> 27:30.648
Is it any help?

27:32.025 --> 27:33.959
Well, either Jafar is in there,

27:34.061 --> 27:35.761
or that bottle has its
own score to settle.

27:35.829 --> 27:37.629
He's a Genie now? Wow.

27:37.664 --> 27:38.704
Aladdin: If he is a Genie,

27:38.766 --> 27:40.510
he's under the control
of whomever summons him,

27:40.534 --> 27:42.868
which means... finally some good luck.

27:42.936 --> 27:44.269
Hook: Fine.

27:44.338 --> 27:45.548
We'll tell him we'll set him free

27:45.572 --> 27:47.291
if he gives us what we want.

27:47.689 --> 27:50.075
He can restore your city
and send me back home, too.

27:51.678 --> 27:52.844
All right.

27:55.100 --> 27:58.583
That sounds [sighs] good, I suppose.

27:58.685 --> 28:01.887
I can't believe I'm gonna
face Jafar on purpose,

28:02.237 --> 28:03.555
but this is my duty.

28:03.657 --> 28:04.956
And how can I lose,

28:05.025 --> 28:08.193
facing him with three heroes at my side?

28:08.262 --> 28:11.229
The way I'm counting,
I see four, Jasmine.

28:11.298 --> 28:12.464
I hope so.

28:13.534 --> 28:15.033
[Bottle opens]

28:15.135 --> 28:16.968
[Whooshing]

28:22.843 --> 28:25.911
Master, your wish is my...

28:28.415 --> 28:29.614
Oh, no.

28:30.551 --> 28:31.650
Never mind.

28:31.752 --> 28:33.151
Son of a fish.

28:33.253 --> 28:34.352
You broke the Genie spell.

28:34.421 --> 28:37.255
That I did, although I was imprisoned.

28:37.357 --> 28:39.224
Thank you all for my freedom.

28:39.326 --> 28:41.359
It's what allows me to do this.

28:45.532 --> 28:48.433
Alone again, Princess.

28:48.535 --> 28:51.036
I wonder if things will
work out as badly for you

28:51.138 --> 28:52.737
as they did last time.

28:55.509 --> 28:58.410
Any one of these tents
could have a soldier in it,

28:58.445 --> 29:03.014
or a strong peasant...
with the heart of a hero.

29:03.116 --> 29:04.683
If only I had more time.

29:04.751 --> 29:06.852
Jasmine, we can do this together.

29:06.954 --> 29:09.087
You just have to have
the courage to say no.

29:11.158 --> 29:12.958
Look. I stole it from the tent.

29:13.060 --> 29:15.026
I don't know what it is, but he had it,

29:15.128 --> 29:16.428
so I'm guessing it's magic.

29:16.530 --> 29:17.963
Ariel...

29:18.065 --> 29:19.331
this is a weapon.

29:19.399 --> 29:21.132
I've seen how it works. It's terrible.

29:21.201 --> 29:23.034
Yes, terrible is good.

29:23.599 --> 29:25.203
We can do this.

29:25.888 --> 29:27.038
<i>You</i> can do this.

29:27.107 --> 29:28.340
But I don't know if I can.

29:28.442 --> 29:30.308
Jafar: It's time, Princess!

29:34.248 --> 29:36.414
I need an answer.

29:36.483 --> 29:37.282
Yeah?

29:37.384 --> 29:38.917
Well, why don't...

29:38.986 --> 29:42.554
Your friend is back in
the sea where she belongs.

29:42.656 --> 29:45.023
And since you won't
marry me, I have no choice

29:45.092 --> 29:47.759
but to destroy Agrabah.

29:47.861 --> 29:48.894
Wait!

29:53.767 --> 29:54.767
I'll marry you.

29:56.169 --> 29:58.837
For the good of Agrabah...

29:59.440 --> 30:01.239
I will be your wife.

30:01.308 --> 30:02.908
Well...

30:03.010 --> 30:05.110
how unexpected.

30:05.145 --> 30:07.913
The crown jewel of
Agrabah, freely given.

30:10.117 --> 30:12.851
Remember this, Princess,

30:12.920 --> 30:16.721
for this is the moment you
truly failed your people.

30:16.790 --> 30:18.957
What are you talking about?

30:19.059 --> 30:22.127
You vain woman.

30:22.229 --> 30:24.896
I never wanted to marry you.

30:24.965 --> 30:28.934
And I never wanted to
rule that grimy place.

30:29.002 --> 30:32.203
The people of Agrabah loathe me.

30:32.272 --> 30:36.641
They spit my name, call me bastard.

30:36.710 --> 30:39.678
And so, I will wipe them off this Earth.

30:39.780 --> 30:42.414
But I gave you that ring so
you wouldn't harm Agrabah.

30:42.482 --> 30:44.316
That was the arrangement.

30:44.652 --> 30:46.818
Yes.

30:46.887 --> 30:48.386
But a true ruler knows

30:48.455 --> 30:51.089
when the other side is bluffing.

30:51.158 --> 30:54.738
If you stayed strong, I
never could have hurt Agrabah.

30:54.754 --> 30:56.628
It's protected by an ancient magic

30:56.730 --> 31:00.031
directly tied to this very jewel.

31:00.133 --> 31:03.034
I could never breach it.

31:03.136 --> 31:06.137
Now, thanks to your
weakness, I <i> can.</i>

31:07.774 --> 31:08.873
No.

31:08.942 --> 31:10.075
Please!

31:10.177 --> 31:11.710
Don't destroy my home!

31:11.812 --> 31:14.479
Oh, it's not being destroyed,

31:14.514 --> 31:18.049
just taken beyond mankind's grasp.

31:21.989 --> 31:24.956
[Wind howling]

31:30.497 --> 31:32.297
What more can you do to me?

31:32.366 --> 31:34.399
You've already taken everything from me.

31:34.501 --> 31:35.700
You have a point there.

31:35.736 --> 31:38.269
I have no more business with you.

31:38.338 --> 31:42.440
I do have a score to settle
with those who trapped me.

31:42.542 --> 31:44.542
Well, then...

31:44.645 --> 31:46.444
farewell, Princess.

31:46.546 --> 31:47.812
Oh, next time,

31:47.881 --> 31:50.348
do bring better champions
than [Chuckling] these.

31:50.417 --> 31:52.150
A fish out of water?

31:52.252 --> 31:53.918
An ex-Savior?

31:53.987 --> 31:56.855
Did you really think you loved him?

31:56.957 --> 31:59.157
Oh, you should've seen
him the way I did...

31:59.226 --> 32:01.059
battle-broken and weeping.

32:01.161 --> 32:02.594
He's a hero.

32:02.696 --> 32:03.862
They all are.

32:03.964 --> 32:05.964
And they think I'm one, too.

32:06.319 --> 32:07.535
So tell me...

32:07.778 --> 32:09.511
where's Agrabah?!

32:10.804 --> 32:12.055
Fine.

32:13.001 --> 32:16.141
But only because the
answer amuses me so.

32:16.243 --> 32:17.976
Really...

32:19.379 --> 32:20.578
how could you not see

32:20.647 --> 32:22.414
that it's practically at your...

32:22.516 --> 32:24.549
fingertips?

32:24.651 --> 32:25.917
The ring.

32:27.421 --> 32:29.254
Look close, Princess.

32:29.356 --> 32:31.389
The first wish <i>did</i> work.

32:33.860 --> 32:35.527
It took me to Agrabah after all.

32:35.562 --> 32:37.328
And it is just as you left it,

32:37.397 --> 32:40.665
al-albeit rather smaller

32:40.767 --> 32:43.568
than is ideal for trade agreements.

32:43.733 --> 32:46.934
Now, did your father never tell
you your duties to your people?

32:46.940 --> 32:50.742
Because you have failed
<i>spectacularly</i> to carry it out,

32:50.811 --> 32:53.311
and thus deserve nothing...

32:53.346 --> 32:56.514
not the paltry love of an ex-Savior,

32:56.616 --> 33:00.385
nor the teeny-tiny
prison of your people.

33:02.656 --> 33:04.155
Now, give me the ring.

33:04.257 --> 33:05.323
No.

33:05.425 --> 33:07.158
I deserve many things,

33:07.194 --> 33:09.661
and I will not let you
keep any of them from me!

33:12.999 --> 33:14.599
Look familiar?

33:15.802 --> 33:17.268
[Gasps]

33:17.370 --> 33:19.037
[Laughs]

33:19.139 --> 33:21.639
Pathetic!

33:21.742 --> 33:23.441
Now, I'm going to take that ring,

33:23.510 --> 33:25.210
if you don't mind.

33:25.312 --> 33:26.077
Aah!

33:26.179 --> 33:28.379
[Whooshing]

33:31.818 --> 33:33.118
Are you all right?

33:33.186 --> 33:34.552
Where's Jafar?

33:38.258 --> 33:40.191
Right here.

33:41.695 --> 33:43.995
It's like you said.

33:44.097 --> 33:45.597
I'm Jasmine of Agrabah,

33:45.901 --> 33:48.568
and now I know how to get my city back.

33:55.241 --> 33:56.507
Can I get another drink?

33:56.785 --> 33:57.918
Bartender: You got it.

33:59.663 --> 34:03.532
"The Dog and the Wolf,"
"The Fox and the Grapes."

34:03.600 --> 34:04.800
Best drinks in town...

34:04.868 --> 34:08.737
original, crafted, locally
sourced where possible.

34:08.806 --> 34:10.833
I'd recommend the Ant
and the Grasshopper.

34:10.934 --> 34:12.808
So, you really are Aesop.

34:13.117 --> 34:14.583
That's right. What gave it away?

34:15.478 --> 34:17.045
[Laughs]

34:17.114 --> 34:19.114
How'd you end up a bartender?

34:19.216 --> 34:21.416
Well, [Chuckles] I prefer "mixologist."

34:21.518 --> 34:23.485
Um, but...

34:23.554 --> 34:25.487
well, I tried writing my own story,

34:25.556 --> 34:26.896
but I never could.

34:26.902 --> 34:30.103
It just kept coming out with
talking animals and canned morals.

34:30.708 --> 34:32.561
Then I went to the
Land of Untold Stories,

34:32.629 --> 34:35.197
because at least
everyone's story was untold.

34:35.264 --> 34:36.625
You couldn't write your own story?

34:36.699 --> 34:38.867
Was it too complicated?

34:38.969 --> 34:40.268
Nah.

34:40.370 --> 34:42.670
That simple, I guess.

34:42.706 --> 34:45.040
"The Artist and His Wife"...

34:45.108 --> 34:46.675
he loves her,

34:46.743 --> 34:49.978
she decides she doesn't love him back.

34:50.080 --> 34:52.080
That's all there is.

34:52.181 --> 34:54.081
Yeah...

34:54.184 --> 34:55.516
I know what that feels like.

34:57.421 --> 34:58.653
You lost someone, too?

35:00.390 --> 35:01.790
Someone I thought I knew.

35:04.862 --> 35:08.430
He always said he was a survivor.

35:08.498 --> 35:10.031
I thought that meant that he would...

35:12.135 --> 35:14.803
stick through things
no matter what, but...

35:14.872 --> 35:18.139
really what it meant was that
as things got tough, he just...

35:19.676 --> 35:21.142
took off.

35:25.115 --> 35:26.748
[Sighs]

35:30.520 --> 35:32.254
Oh, Emma.

35:34.024 --> 35:36.458
Well, [Sighs] you guys
got what you wanted.

35:36.560 --> 35:37.759
[Inhales sharply]

35:37.828 --> 35:39.828
Regina, you got what
you wanted. [Chuckles]

35:39.930 --> 35:41.830
I didn't <i> want</i> it.

35:41.932 --> 35:43.031
I know.

35:44.935 --> 35:45.935
You were probably right.

35:46.036 --> 35:47.769
[Inhales sharply]

35:47.804 --> 35:49.004
It's probably what I needed.

35:49.106 --> 35:51.573
It's probably... what I need to...

35:51.642 --> 35:53.308
move on.

36:10.994 --> 36:13.361
Sorry I couldn't help you get home.

36:13.463 --> 36:15.697
Oh, I understand.

36:15.766 --> 36:17.265
[Sighs] And if you, uh,

36:17.334 --> 36:18.774
really know how to get Agrabah back,

36:18.802 --> 36:21.169
then maybe somebody there can help me.

36:21.271 --> 36:23.204
So... where is it?

36:24.675 --> 36:26.207
In the jewel.

36:26.310 --> 36:27.609
Really?

36:27.711 --> 36:29.077
Aladdin...

36:29.112 --> 36:32.714
that's why it was in my
pocket after I wished for it.

36:32.783 --> 36:36.251
Oh, I can see my hovel from here.

36:36.320 --> 36:39.187
Are you sure you don't
want to use your last wish?

36:39.289 --> 36:40.956
You could bring it back.

36:41.024 --> 36:41.957
No.

36:42.025 --> 36:43.391
If I were to use the last wish,

36:43.493 --> 36:45.760
I'd wish it to free Aladdin.

36:45.862 --> 36:48.997
You should never have
had to do this for me.

36:49.066 --> 36:52.267
Jasmine, I'd do anything for you.

36:52.369 --> 36:53.568
Thank you.

36:55.339 --> 36:57.072
But I have a better idea.

36:57.401 --> 36:58.667
My father used to tell me

36:58.673 --> 37:00.909
that duty had to come before love.

37:00.978 --> 37:03.278
So I told myself that
losing Agrabah meant

37:03.380 --> 37:06.081
that I could never have
love until I won it back.

37:06.446 --> 37:08.713
But when Jafar told me the same thing,

37:08.767 --> 37:12.269
I finally realized that
the way to get Agrabah back

37:12.292 --> 37:15.557
was with the kind of magic
that could break any curse.

37:40.017 --> 37:41.816
Look what you did, Princess.

37:41.918 --> 37:46.187
Mm. That is such a lovely ring.

37:46.289 --> 37:47.289
Hmm.

37:47.324 --> 37:49.391
Oh, now that the city's out of here,

37:49.493 --> 37:50.558
can I keep this?

37:50.627 --> 37:52.961
[Both chuckle]

37:53.030 --> 37:54.062
You did it.

37:54.164 --> 37:56.498
You are a hero.

38:02.172 --> 38:03.371
I'm free.

38:03.473 --> 38:05.040
I'm free!

38:05.108 --> 38:07.042
[Both laughing]

38:07.110 --> 38:10.678
Now let me show you my world.

38:10.781 --> 38:12.080
[Chuckles]

38:21.124 --> 38:22.857
You're a long way from your island.

38:24.861 --> 38:26.528
Are you as stranded here as I am?

38:26.630 --> 38:28.863
No. We're close to the Agraban Gulf.

38:28.932 --> 38:31.366
Once I hit the water, I'll
be home faster than you think.

38:31.435 --> 38:33.034
And I'm sure you'll find someone here

38:33.136 --> 38:35.003
who can help you get
back to Storybrooke, too.

38:35.072 --> 38:36.832
I hope so. I need to
tell Emma what happened,

38:36.873 --> 38:38.406
warn her about Gideon.

38:38.508 --> 38:40.542
Ah! I'm an oyster-head!

38:40.644 --> 38:42.277
I have something.

38:42.379 --> 38:45.313
Mermaid magic... it works across realms.

38:45.686 --> 38:47.036
We can get a signal back to Storybrooke

38:47.042 --> 38:48.849
if there's anyone there
who could pick it up.

38:48.850 --> 38:51.884
A shell phone. I have
one like it at home.

38:52.856 --> 38:55.123
Henry, I'm home.

38:55.192 --> 38:58.626
I have to go pick up my car
from Aesop's Tables tomorrow.

38:58.728 --> 39:00.995
[Sighs]

39:01.064 --> 39:03.064
I told you to stick
this stuff in the shed.

39:03.166 --> 39:04.265
What?

39:04.669 --> 39:07.603
Oh, sorry. I got it. Never mind.

39:10.440 --> 39:11.973
[Sighs]

39:18.515 --> 39:20.715
[Breathing raggedly]

39:20.784 --> 39:22.217
Hook: <i>[Muffled] Emma.</i>

39:22.285 --> 39:23.618
What the hell?

39:25.222 --> 39:26.554
<i>[Muffled] Emma.</i>

39:29.626 --> 39:30.626
<i>[Static]</i>

39:30.727 --> 39:32.760
<i>Emma.</i>

39:33.730 --> 39:34.963
<i>Em...</i>

39:36.099 --> 39:38.566
<i>Emma.</i>

39:38.635 --> 39:40.335
<i>Emma, are you there?</i>

39:43.740 --> 39:45.240
I didn't mean to leave.

39:45.308 --> 39:47.242
I was... I was on my way back to you,

39:47.310 --> 39:50.545
and... Gideon... he sent me away.

39:52.482 --> 39:53.882
I would never leave you.

39:53.950 --> 39:55.550
Killian?

39:55.652 --> 39:58.653
Emma, he wanted me out of the way.

39:58.755 --> 40:00.188
And I love you.

40:00.290 --> 40:03.424
<i>I don't know if you
can hear me, but...</i>

40:03.493 --> 40:04.993
I'm trying to get home to you...

40:07.197 --> 40:09.464
and I won't ever stop until I do.

40:09.935 --> 40:11.866
I love you, too.

40:16.273 --> 40:17.273
Killian...

40:19.676 --> 40:20.808
Killian?

40:20.877 --> 40:22.810
Aesop: He can't hear you.

40:22.879 --> 40:26.114
Not while I hold onto
the tears of the Savior.

40:26.216 --> 40:28.349
This is some powerful stuff.

40:28.451 --> 40:30.618
You should be more
careful where you leave it.

40:30.923 --> 40:32.156
What are you doing here?

40:34.057 --> 40:35.436
You're not Aesop, are you?

40:35.442 --> 40:37.042
You're not even a bartender.

40:39.529 --> 40:40.795
No.

40:42.065 --> 40:45.433
What now, Gideon? You
try to kill me again?

40:46.018 --> 40:48.052
It didn't turn out very
well for you last time.

40:48.136 --> 40:50.071
Mm, indeed I made a terrible mistake,

40:50.207 --> 40:52.440
trying to steal the
powers of the Savior.

40:52.542 --> 40:53.808
But what I really need

40:53.910 --> 40:56.778
is for you to use those powers...

40:56.880 --> 40:59.113
to help me.

40:59.216 --> 41:02.650
You don't really have me in
a helping mood right now, pal.

41:02.752 --> 41:04.752
You sure about that?

41:04.821 --> 41:05.932
Because love makes us do things

41:05.956 --> 41:07.889
we never thought possible.

41:07.895 --> 41:09.795
And so long as I have this,

41:09.993 --> 41:11.893
I can ensure there will be no portals

41:11.995 --> 41:14.062
between you and the man you love.

41:14.164 --> 41:15.530
So I'm afraid...

41:15.632 --> 41:17.966
the good Captain will have
to stay right where he is

41:18.068 --> 41:21.069
until you help me out
and earn my gratitude.

41:21.171 --> 41:22.804
All right, I'm listening.

41:24.541 --> 41:26.941
What the hell do I have to do?

41:27.541 --> 41:29.407
The one thing I never could...

41:33.140 --> 41:34.773
kill the Black Fairy.
