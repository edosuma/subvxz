<i>GROVER: Pardon me, Judge.</i>

00:19.399 --> 00:22.602
Just need to have a word with
my good friend, Mr. Cullen.

00:22.669 --> 00:23.903
What is this all about?

00:23.971 --> 00:26.491
Your Mercedes exploded
outside of your house.

00:26.516 --> 00:29.208
STEVE: Your wife decided to
drive your daughter to school.

00:29.276 --> 00:30.353
They were both killed in the explosion.

00:30.384 --> 00:32.545
- It's a theory.
- But here's the thing,

00:32.613 --> 00:34.547
I'm gonna bet on that theory.

00:34.572 --> 00:36.206
(scoffs) Wes Cullen,

00:36.231 --> 00:38.794
you're under arrest
for conspiracy to commit murder.

00:38.819 --> 00:41.454
Prosecuting attorney isn't
gonna be charging Cullen.

00:41.479 --> 00:43.523
Doesn't feel like he has enough
evidence for a conviction,

00:43.548 --> 00:45.649
which means it's gonna be
up to us to make that case.

00:45.802 --> 00:47.759
- Us?
- Yeah, us.

00:47.799 --> 00:50.439
- I hope you want to be involved.
- I do.

I need a bomb squad
at my house right now.

01:38.672 --> 01:40.030

02:00.059 --> 02:02.244
There's a smudge on my water glass.

02:02.269 --> 02:03.954
The glass was dirty, Nate.

02:04.275 --> 02:06.199
And the waiter was rude
to me. And what did you do?

02:06.224 --> 02:07.791
You said absolutely nothing.

02:07.859 --> 02:09.673
(sighs) I just wish, one time,

02:09.698 --> 02:11.262
just once, that you
would stand up for me,

02:11.287 --> 02:13.790
that you would actually take my side.

02:14.532 --> 02:16.533
Dr. Goldman was right.

gonna solve our problems.

02:19.140 --> 02:20.807
Yeah, well, at least I'm trying.

Goldman hasn't told us

09:59.679 --> 10:00.890
We're with the Five-O Task Force.

10:00.914 --> 10:02.981
I'm gonna need everyone's
help to move this rock.

10:03.086 --> 10:04.926
All right, everyone. You
guys, we're gonna move

10:04.951 --> 10:06.919
this top rock here. Big push.

10:06.986 --> 10:09.488
Come on, guys, push. Push!

10:09.513 --> 10:11.714
(grunting)

10:13.823 --> 10:15.260
(panting)

10:15.371 --> 10:17.205
Okay, Tani. Your turn. Let's go.

10:17.230 --> 10:18.163
(groaning)

10:18.231 --> 10:19.364
(Tani grunts)

10:19.432 --> 10:21.366
All the way. (grunts)

10:21.861 --> 10:24.145
Okay. Luana,

10:24.170 --> 10:25.571
we're gonna pull you out, okay?

10:25.638 --> 10:26.939
Ready?

10:29.799 --> 10:31.476
(panting) What do we got?

10:31.544 --> 10:32.664
Stay still. You're all right.

10:32.712 --> 10:33.779
- (whimpering)
- I got you.

10:33.804 --> 10:35.272
Put your arms around me.

10:36.749 --> 10:38.750
Come on. Oh, my gosh.

10:40.753 --> 10:42.955
- Okay. Tani, close the door.
- (Luana crying)

10:44.333 --> 10:45.757
Okay.

10:45.825 --> 10:46.992
Stay calm. You're all right.

10:47.060 --> 10:48.637
You're okay. You're
okay. I'm right here.

10:48.661 --> 10:49.861
TANI: Look, it's not

10:49.886 --> 10:52.354
a spinal injury, but both
legs are likely broken.

10:52.465 --> 10:54.043
All right, we're gonna need to
find something to stabilize her,

10:54.067 --> 10:55.434
some sort of brace.

10:55.501 --> 10:58.303
I saw... I saw a surfboard.

10:58.371 --> 11:00.706
Okay, go. Go. It's okay.
You're gonna be all right.

11:00.816 --> 11:03.084
All right? Okay, everyone else?

11:03.384 --> 11:05.677
Okay, what we need to do right
now is establish communication

11:05.702 --> 11:07.069
with rescue teams outside.

11:07.384 --> 11:10.215
So what I want you guys to
do is walk around and see

11:10.240 --> 11:12.174
if you can find me a cell signal. Yes?

11:12.199 --> 11:13.466
- Yes.
- Move.

11:14.573 --> 11:17.163
Luana, how you feeling? You okay?

11:19.759 --> 11:21.093
Turns out I was wrong.

11:21.203 --> 11:22.737
You are good with a surfboard.

11:22.762 --> 11:24.630
All right.

11:24.697 --> 11:26.798
So, I, uh, I checked
every corner of this place.

11:26.823 --> 11:28.290
There's no cell service.

11:28.546 --> 11:30.545
All right. Well, maybe someone
else will have better luck.

11:30.570 --> 11:33.171
And what if they don't?

11:33.282 --> 11:35.183
What's the plan for getting out of here?

11:35.566 --> 11:37.734
All right, gather
everyone and come with me.

11:38.553 --> 11:39.887
All right, you guys can't see it,

11:39.912 --> 11:42.447
but behind all this rubble's a
service exit that leads outside.

11:42.515 --> 11:43.792
You think we can clear
all that out of the way?

11:43.816 --> 11:45.423
Dude, that's gonna take hours.

11:45.448 --> 11:46.728
Maybe, but it's our only option.

11:46.753 --> 11:48.186
Yeah, I saw a work truck

11:48.254 --> 11:50.055
up there. There's tons of shovels on it.

11:50.123 --> 11:51.900
I think if we all work
together, we can clear a path

11:51.924 --> 11:53.502
- to the door.
- AKONI: I saw that work truck, too.

11:53.526 --> 11:55.127
There's a jackhammer on it.

11:55.237 --> 11:57.505
I say we drill through
that wall into the exit.

11:57.530 --> 11:58.563
JUNIOR: Hey, no. No. No.

11:58.674 --> 12:00.375
That's too risky.
Okay, we start drilling,

12:00.400 --> 12:02.634
and vibrations can bring
this whole place down.

12:02.702 --> 12:05.137
- You sure? It seems to have settled.
- ANO: Has it, now?

12:05.204 --> 12:06.798
- You in construction?
- I'm a dentist.

12:06.823 --> 12:08.651
Well, I'm an engineering
major, and I'd like to live

12:08.675 --> 12:09.785
long enough to finish my degree.

12:09.816 --> 12:10.976
- Junior's right.
- AKONI: Is he?

12:11.001 --> 12:12.721
Because I don't want to
die in here shoveling rock

12:12.746 --> 12:14.097
when there's a faster way out.

12:14.122 --> 12:16.190
Guys! I think we can all
agree that standing here

12:16.215 --> 12:18.116
arguing about it is
not gonna do anything.

12:18.141 --> 12:19.074
AKONI: Fine.

12:19.099 --> 12:20.366
We'll try it your way.

12:20.520 --> 12:23.680
- Where are those shovels?
- In the truck.

12:26.490 --> 12:28.037
STEVE: This is the
emergency service exit.

12:28.061 --> 12:29.071
- That's it, right there.
- DANNY: This is the guy

12:29.095 --> 12:30.406
in the yellow vest who gave me these.

12:30.430 --> 12:32.541
He told me that's right where
the second explosion happened.

12:32.565 --> 12:34.543
So even if we can get down
there, it's-it's gonna be

12:34.567 --> 12:36.654
a-a mountain of rubble on
the other side of that door.

12:36.679 --> 12:38.012
I understand that,

12:38.037 --> 12:39.448
but that's still our best
option, Danny. We have to get

12:39.472 --> 12:40.872
as many able-bodied people as we can

12:40.940 --> 12:42.074
to help clear the rubble out

12:42.141 --> 12:43.686
and get in there.
That's what we got to do.

12:43.710 --> 12:45.911
Do me a favor, reach out
to HFD and HTA, please.

12:45.978 --> 12:47.145
All right.

12:47.170 --> 12:49.266
(phone rings)

12:49.291 --> 12:51.192
Yeah, Lou. Go ahead.

12:51.217 --> 12:54.095
So, I've been looking at
CCTV footage of this tunnel.

12:54.120 --> 12:56.922
A black van drives into
it, and like roaches

12:56.947 --> 12:58.833
in a roach motel, it never comes out.

12:58.858 --> 13:00.202
That could be our prisoner transport.

13:00.226 --> 13:01.326
You get the license plate?

13:01.394 --> 13:04.162
Of course. And whoever they're moving

13:04.187 --> 13:06.641
must be some big muckety-muck,
because the damn van

13:06.666 --> 13:08.800
is registered to the
Department of Defense.

13:08.868 --> 13:10.168
Wait, the DoD?

13:10.236 --> 13:11.970
- Talk to them?
- Oh, yeah, sure.

13:12.038 --> 13:13.371
They were real helpful, too.

13:13.396 --> 13:15.583
They sent over the transportation log

13:15.608 --> 13:18.110
with the prisoner's name
conveniently blacked out.

13:18.135 --> 13:19.636
What the hell's going on here, man?

13:19.746 --> 13:21.858
I don't know, but I know who to talk to.

13:21.883 --> 13:23.184
I'll call you back.

13:25.351 --> 13:26.595
(chuckles): Sorry, it's been a minute

13:26.619 --> 13:28.386
since I've been in a civilian vehicle.

13:28.411 --> 13:30.813
- Just got off a rotation in Kabul.
- Mm.

13:31.145 --> 13:33.301
Well, it'd be a shame
to survive a war zone

13:33.326 --> 13:34.503
just to die in a car accident.

13:34.527 --> 13:36.567
Speed limit on base is 30 miles an hour.

13:37.480 --> 13:39.014
(phone rings)

13:39.665 --> 13:41.733
Excuse me.

13:41.801 --> 13:43.969
- Steve, hey.
- Quinn, I need a favor.

13:44.079 --> 13:45.713
Give me a sec.

13:46.694 --> 13:48.707
All right. No ticket for you today.

13:48.775 --> 13:50.452
But I stop you again, you'll
be cruising around base

13:50.477 --> 13:52.812
on a banana seat Schwinn
with your gun in the basket.

13:52.879 --> 13:54.389
Yes, ma'am.

13:54.857 --> 13:56.691
QUINN: Okay, what do you need?

13:56.716 --> 13:59.084
I assume you heard about
the Kapahulu Tunnel collapse?

13:59.109 --> 14:00.142
Of course.

14:00.167 --> 14:01.344
Tani and Junior are trapped in there

14:01.369 --> 14:02.430
and one of the vehicles in there

14:02.455 --> 14:04.156
is a black prisoner transpo van.

14:04.181 --> 14:06.562
Except the two guards
assigned to it are dead

14:06.859 --> 14:08.894
- and the prisoner's gone.
- Wait.

14:08.961 --> 14:10.372
So the tunnel collapse was engineered

14:10.396 --> 14:11.463
as part of an escape?

14:11.488 --> 14:12.921
Yeah, we think so.

14:13.075 --> 14:15.443
And that prisoner transpo
van... The license plate

14:15.468 --> 14:18.403
registers back to you guys. The DoD.

14:18.428 --> 14:19.628
Quinn, I'm not

14:19.653 --> 14:21.899
trying to get you in any deeper, but...

14:23.157 --> 14:26.611
- What's the plate?
- Bravo-Echo-73-Jericho.

14:28.714 --> 14:30.682
Damn, this file

14:30.707 --> 14:32.875
is redacted from me, too.

14:32.985 --> 14:34.452
Don't have the clearance.

14:34.477 --> 14:37.398
Damn it. Thank you for
trying. I appreciate it.

14:37.980 --> 14:39.000
Hold on.

14:39.025 --> 14:42.828
I may not be able to tell you
who the prisoner in the van was,

14:42.853 --> 14:44.505
but I can tell you
where they were going.

14:44.530 --> 14:45.292
Go ahead.

14:45.317 --> 14:47.199
All our vehicles are
equipped with tracking.

14:47.224 --> 14:49.081
This one started off this afternoon

14:49.106 --> 14:50.602
at a residence in Kaneohe.

14:50.670 --> 14:51.603
Sending you the address now.

14:51.671 --> 14:52.704
You're the best.

14:52.772 --> 14:54.216
Thank you so much. I
really appreciate it.

14:54.241 --> 14:55.274
I-I owe you one.

14:55.384 --> 14:57.318
Yes, you do, Steve.

14:57.343 --> 14:58.723
Good luck.

15:08.995 --> 15:11.663
This is where our mystery van
started out this afternoon.

15:17.324 --> 15:19.279
- Danny...
- DANNY: I see it.

15:42.599 --> 15:43.866
Clear.

15:47.093 --> 15:49.127
Clear. These guys are Feds.

15:49.195 --> 15:51.229
I got a soundproof room.

15:51.632 --> 15:52.966
A cot.

15:53.966 --> 15:55.609
Some sort of toilet.

15:55.634 --> 15:57.768
No windows.

15:58.180 --> 16:00.548
This is either the
worst Airbnb in Hawaii

16:00.573 --> 16:02.778
or the Feds were holding somebody here.

16:03.619 --> 16:05.853
All three are dead.
Bodies are still warm.

16:05.878 --> 16:09.447
We got steel-reinforced
windows and doors.

16:09.515 --> 16:11.349
- (door creaking)
- Hey, hey, hey.

16:12.561 --> 16:14.896
(exhales sharply)

16:14.921 --> 16:16.321
We've got to stop meeting like this.

16:16.355 --> 16:18.390
Y-Y-You're personally taking years

16:18.415 --> 16:20.551
off of my life, you know that?
What the hell are you doing here?

16:20.660 --> 16:21.670
What are you talking about?

16:21.694 --> 16:23.395
Your boss called me for help.

16:23.462 --> 16:24.742
Plus, this is far too interesting

16:24.797 --> 16:26.197
to sit this one out.

16:26.265 --> 16:29.123
I'm starting to see why she gets
into so much trouble at work.

16:29.148 --> 16:30.470
Looks like our prisoner
was being debriefed here.

16:30.536 --> 16:31.680
Did you check out the camera?

16:31.704 --> 16:32.737
We just got here.

16:32.762 --> 16:33.896
DANNY: Be my guest.

16:35.927 --> 16:37.451
MAN: You want to talk distribution?

16:37.476 --> 16:39.144
How much time do you got?

16:39.211 --> 16:42.280
Mention Jackson Wilcox to
anyone in Arizona, Nevada,

16:42.305 --> 16:45.941
Utah, California...
The all know my name.

16:46.137 --> 16:47.504
WOMAN: What about Santiago Vega?

16:47.529 --> 16:50.298
Do you have dealings
with him or his cartel?

16:50.323 --> 16:52.334
If by "dealings" you mean
did I wipe him off the map,

16:52.358 --> 16:53.458
then yeah.

16:53.483 --> 16:55.183
WOMAN: And what about Cristobal Moreno?

16:55.208 --> 16:58.506
WILCOX: Moreno? That
jumpy little roach is next.

16:58.531 --> 17:00.598
Okay, who the hell is this guy?

17:00.623 --> 17:02.224
Jackson Wilcox.

17:02.249 --> 17:05.050
He was the biggest
distributor of methamphetamines

17:05.075 --> 17:06.614
west of the Mississippi.

17:06.797 --> 17:08.549
That was fast.

17:08.574 --> 17:10.508
Yeah, well, apparently,
this thing in my hand

17:10.576 --> 17:11.787
has something called the Internet,

17:11.810 --> 17:13.578
and I can pretty much
access the entirety

17:13.603 --> 17:15.103
of all human knowledge.

17:15.127 --> 17:18.192
So it looks like the Feds were
using this Wilcox fella here

17:18.217 --> 17:19.651
to build some sort of case.

17:19.675 --> 17:21.185
Well, now we know who we're looking for.

17:21.252 --> 17:23.621
- That's good, right?
- Well, here's the thing.

17:23.689 --> 17:26.523
Two years ago, the Feds
raided Wilcox's compound

17:26.549 --> 17:27.549
in McGill, Nevada.

17:28.487 --> 17:29.494
Okay.

17:29.519 --> 17:32.815
Yeah, well, according to
this, he was shot dead.

17:33.937 --> 17:36.409
So that guy in the DoD van is a ghost.

17:41.773 --> 17:43.780
(indistinct conversations)

17:45.406 --> 17:47.340
Okay, she's telling
me that the Feds wanted

17:47.408 --> 17:49.219
everybody to believe that
Jackson Wilcox is dead.

17:49.243 --> 17:50.243
ADAM: Exactly.

17:50.268 --> 17:51.435
He was injured in a raid

17:51.460 --> 17:52.615
and the feds saw an opportunity.

17:52.640 --> 17:54.208
Yeah, stick him in a dark hole,

17:54.225 --> 17:56.727
use him to build a massive federal case.

17:56.752 --> 17:58.397
And that way, no one suspects
it's him dropping dimes,

17:58.422 --> 17:59.632
because he's supposed to be dead.

17:59.740 --> 18:01.341
Makes perfect sense why they dragged him

18:01.366 --> 18:02.966
all the way to Oahu.

18:02.991 --> 18:05.069
They wanted to get him as far
away from Nevada as possible.

18:05.094 --> 18:07.062
While still keeping him on U.S. soil.

18:07.172 --> 18:08.382
And to keep the case under wraps,

18:08.406 --> 18:10.541
the Feds borrowed a
transpo van from the DoD

18:10.566 --> 18:12.128
so it wouldn't trace back to them.

18:12.153 --> 18:13.987
Yeah, okay, that
obviously did not work out.

18:14.473 --> 18:16.656
And Wilcox's crew finds
out that their boss is alive

18:16.681 --> 18:19.659
and well here in Hawaii,
and this is the end result.

18:19.684 --> 18:21.718
Steve, these agents were
killed very recently.

18:21.743 --> 18:23.930
The tunnel's about a mile
away from the black site.

18:23.955 --> 18:26.290
I mean, it's possible Wilcox
made it all the way back there

18:26.315 --> 18:27.626
before anybody knew he was missing.

18:27.651 --> 18:29.195
Well, that certainly
explains how he was able

18:29.220 --> 18:30.537
to catch those guys off guard.

18:30.562 --> 18:32.002
What, did he leave his wallet behind?

18:32.063 --> 18:33.107
Why-why would he come back?

18:33.131 --> 18:34.698
Danny's right. The guy had escaped.

18:34.723 --> 18:36.276
It doesn't make sense
that he'd risk his life

18:36.301 --> 18:38.387
just to settle scores
with his interrogators.

18:38.412 --> 18:40.875
So what was important
enough to come back here for?

18:40.900 --> 18:43.284
I don't know. Let's reach out
to the Kapolei field office,

18:43.308 --> 18:44.451
make sure the Feds are up to speed.

18:44.475 --> 18:46.195
It's possible they
know something we don't.

18:46.220 --> 18:47.220
All right, you got it.

18:47.245 --> 18:48.747
Hey, Duke.

18:49.214 --> 18:50.480
Heard you got something.

18:50.548 --> 18:52.849
We found a small blood trail
outside the service exit.

18:52.874 --> 18:54.494
We think that this is where the prisoner

18:54.519 --> 18:55.586
and his men escaped.

18:55.611 --> 18:56.829
We called in a K-9 unit,

18:56.854 --> 18:58.432
but the dogs lost the
scent about a quarter mile

18:58.457 --> 18:59.991
into the jungle.

19:00.016 --> 19:02.884
It's possible these suspects
had a vehicle waiting for them.

19:02.909 --> 19:05.410
Let's get CSU up here, have
'em run a trace on that blood.

19:05.435 --> 19:06.579
Hopefully they can turn up something.

19:06.667 --> 19:08.009
You got it.

19:11.436 --> 19:14.805
Keawe, how we doing clearing
out this access point?

19:14.830 --> 19:16.391
We're going as quickly as we can,

19:16.416 --> 19:18.384
but using power tools
could cause a cave-in,

19:18.409 --> 19:20.384
so we're forced to
do everything by hand.

19:20.678 --> 19:23.513
We got to move faster.

19:23.538 --> 19:25.758
Come on, come on, come on.

19:25.783 --> 19:27.184
(indistinct chatter)

19:28.996 --> 19:31.097
Let's go, let's move. Come on!

19:31.122 --> 19:33.423
Get some more guys in here, let's go.

19:39.497 --> 19:43.007
Lady... please step aside if
you can't work any faster.

19:43.067 --> 19:45.145
At the rate you're going,
you're just getting in the way.

19:45.169 --> 19:46.703
NATE: Hey, lay off.

19:46.770 --> 19:48.314
She's exhausted and
doing the best she can,

19:48.339 --> 19:49.339
same as the rest of us.

19:49.374 --> 19:51.451
So keep your head down
and your mouth shut.

20:00.184 --> 20:01.485
Oh, my God.

20:01.552 --> 20:03.086
There's someone under here.

20:03.630 --> 20:05.198
Okay, everyone step back,

20:05.223 --> 20:07.057
step back.

20:07.125 --> 20:08.809
Come on, come on.

20:11.795 --> 20:13.962
(grunting)

20:16.167 --> 20:17.434
Okay. Okay.

20:17.502 --> 20:18.646
Junior and I are gonna move the body.

20:18.670 --> 20:20.270
- Will you two help us?
- Okay.

20:21.869 --> 20:23.670
Thank you.

20:25.400 --> 20:27.902
(grunting)

20:30.478 --> 20:33.250
Let's see if we can move
the rest of these rocks.

20:33.318 --> 20:35.786
(all grunting)

20:44.634 --> 20:47.348
Just let it slide. Let it fall.

20:48.409 --> 20:51.010
TANI: Let's take him
to the transport van.

20:51.035 --> 20:53.136
(grunting)

20:55.067 --> 20:57.507
CAROL: My God, look at
the size of that thing.

20:57.532 --> 20:59.786
Oh. Are you kidding me?!

20:59.811 --> 21:01.278
Told you this was a waste of time.

21:01.389 --> 21:03.823
We're never gonna be able to move that.

21:04.019 --> 21:05.575
Excuse me.

21:11.928 --> 21:13.129
Hold on.

21:15.708 --> 21:17.139
Walkie.

21:20.396 --> 21:22.530
No. It's dead.

21:23.801 --> 21:25.469
(jackhammer drilling)

21:25.494 --> 21:26.928
Hey. Hey!

21:28.449 --> 21:29.716
Hey! Stop!

21:29.741 --> 21:32.409
Stop! The walls aren't stable! Stop!

21:33.124 --> 21:35.025
(grunts)

21:39.113 --> 21:40.432
What the hell happened?

21:40.457 --> 21:42.162
COLLEGE STUDENT: He must have
hit a power-line on the other side.

21:42.186 --> 21:43.668
Shorted the power.

21:43.941 --> 21:46.132
He's got a pulse.
Barely, but it's there.

21:46.157 --> 21:48.035
He's probably got heart
damage. Joons, if he doesn't get

21:48.060 --> 21:49.700
to the hospital right
now, he's gonna die.

21:51.810 --> 21:53.144
Commander, we have a problem.

21:54.208 --> 21:57.009
Somehow the electricity in
the main tunnel got shorted.

21:57.034 --> 21:58.545
We have backup power,
but there's no telling

21:58.569 --> 21:59.870
how long the generator will last.

21:59.895 --> 22:01.714
Which means we could
lose that ventilation fan.

22:01.739 --> 22:03.006
Right?

22:03.074 --> 22:04.485
If that happens, how
much breathable oxygen

22:04.509 --> 22:05.842
will those people have?

22:05.909 --> 22:08.054
Hard to say without knowing
the condition of the survivors.

22:08.079 --> 22:09.679
But that fan was constantly

22:09.704 --> 22:11.817
filtering out carbon monoxide.

22:12.183 --> 22:16.119
Without it, I'd guess no more
than 20, 30 minutes, max.

22:16.989 --> 22:20.032
I mean, we have to establish
communication with these people.

22:20.057 --> 22:22.492
You said we don't have
a passageway big enough

22:22.560 --> 22:24.520
to get one of our rescuers in, right?

22:25.399 --> 22:26.766
What about a dog?

22:27.965 --> 22:29.299
Come with me.

22:29.324 --> 22:31.325
♪

22:35.940 --> 22:37.740
You know there's no
guarantee he finds a path.

22:37.775 --> 22:39.653
Even if he does, he could
get trapped in there himself.

22:39.677 --> 22:40.844
I understand the risks.

22:40.869 --> 22:42.422
Hey, buddy. Sit. Sit.

22:42.447 --> 22:46.116
Good boy. Good boy.
Thank you. Thank you.

22:46.184 --> 22:47.617
You smell this. You smell it.

22:47.642 --> 22:50.043
Smell this. That's Junior, okay?

22:50.068 --> 22:51.469
Good boy. Smell this.

22:51.494 --> 22:52.932
Yeah. That's Tani.

22:52.957 --> 22:54.257
That's Tani. Good boy.

22:54.282 --> 22:56.378
That's right. That's Junior and Tani.

22:56.403 --> 22:57.637
Okay, you're gonna go in there

22:57.662 --> 22:59.206
and you're gonna take
this walkie to them.

22:59.230 --> 23:02.032
You got this. You got this.

23:02.099 --> 23:03.233
You got this. Let's go.

23:03.301 --> 23:05.302
Let's go, Eddie. Ready?

23:06.514 --> 23:07.680
All right, guys, coming in.

23:07.705 --> 23:08.905
Coming in. Coming in.

23:08.973 --> 23:10.740
Ready. Go, Eddie, go.

23:10.808 --> 23:11.908
Find. Go, Eddie, go.

23:11.967 --> 23:13.768
- (Eddie barking)
- Go. Good boy.

23:13.793 --> 23:16.326
That's it, boy. Good
boy. Good boy. Go get 'em.

23:17.558 --> 23:18.958
<i>WOMAN: It doesn't make sense.</i>

23:18.983 --> 23:21.251
I checked in with the
on-site leader a little over

23:21.276 --> 23:24.130
half an hour ago. He
said everything was fine.

23:24.155 --> 23:25.795
S.A.C. Shinoya, I hate
to break it to you,

23:25.823 --> 23:27.224
but when your agent said that,

23:27.249 --> 23:29.150
he probably had a gun to his head.

23:29.175 --> 23:31.261
L-Let's just start at the beginning.

23:31.286 --> 23:33.105
Why was he being moved
in the first place?

23:33.130 --> 23:35.376
- Why was he in that van?
- We didn't have a choice.

23:35.401 --> 23:38.735
He needs routine radiation
treatments for throat cancer.

23:38.760 --> 23:40.746
We can't get testimony from a dead man.

23:40.771 --> 23:41.905
QUINN: Fair enough.

23:41.973 --> 23:43.173
So whoever sprung him

23:43.198 --> 23:44.757
must've figured out his
treatment schedule somehow.

23:44.782 --> 23:47.711
Here's what I don't understand.
Why did Wilcox come back here?

23:47.736 --> 23:50.189
I mean, it wasn't just
to murder these three men.

23:50.323 --> 23:51.624
- What did he want?
- (door opens)

23:53.212 --> 23:55.394
We've got three bodies, not four.

23:55.419 --> 23:56.720
Agent Opunui isn't here.

23:56.787 --> 23:58.788
Okay, so that's it. He's got a hostage.

23:58.856 --> 24:01.258
We have to warn them. Make the call now.

24:01.368 --> 24:03.269
- Warn who?
- You want to tell us

24:03.294 --> 24:04.494
what the hell is going on?

24:06.998 --> 24:08.932
<i>SHINOYA: Wilcox's wife
is in protective custody.</i>

24:08.957 --> 24:10.376
<i>He's taking out anyone</i>

24:10.401 --> 24:12.700
<i>standing in his way of finding her.</i>

24:12.958 --> 24:14.825
We're all good here.

24:17.561 --> 24:19.195
Shayla?

24:23.071 --> 24:24.405
There she is.

24:28.945 --> 24:30.912
<i>ADAM: Steve, we're at the FBI location</i>

24:30.937 --> 24:33.076
where Wilcox's wife
Shayla was brought over

24:33.101 --> 24:34.936
from the mainland three days ago.

24:34.961 --> 24:36.828
It was a new condition
of his cooperation.

24:36.853 --> 24:38.954
And the feds needed him
to keep talking, so...

24:39.022 --> 24:41.390
So it's highly possible that
Wilcox downloaded his wife

24:41.415 --> 24:43.201
on the schedule of
his cancer treatments,

24:43.226 --> 24:45.413
and that's how his team
knew when and where to hit?

24:45.438 --> 24:48.406
Well, I get that Wilcox and
his wife had private visits, but

24:48.431 --> 24:50.009
the rest of the time,
the feds had Shayla

24:50.033 --> 24:51.810
under strict supervision.

24:51.835 --> 24:53.079
So, when was she in communication

24:53.103 --> 24:54.612
with the strike team?

24:54.637 --> 24:56.515
Yeah, I mean, you make a good
point. It seems like a very

24:56.539 --> 25:00.061
slim window to create
such an elaborate plan.

25:00.086 --> 25:02.454
- Hey hey. Hey, hey. Hey.
- (man groans)

25:03.457 --> 25:04.665
This one's alive.

25:04.690 --> 25:06.558
- ADAM: You hear that, Steve?
- STEVE: Yes, I did.

25:06.590 --> 25:08.626
That guy is our best
chance at finding out

25:08.651 --> 25:10.652
where Wilcox was headed.
Let me know the minute

25:10.677 --> 25:13.112
- the paramedics have him stabilized.
- Will do.

25:13.137 --> 25:16.572
Two, three. (grunts)

25:22.944 --> 25:24.618
(Eddie barks)

25:24.643 --> 25:26.644
- TANI: Eddie? Hey!
- JUNIOR: Eddie! Hey, it's Eddie!

25:26.669 --> 25:28.337
Eddie! Eddie, hey, Eddie!

25:28.404 --> 25:30.297
Joons, we're in luck... Brought a walkie.

25:30.664 --> 25:32.383
Oh, Eddie, good boy!

25:32.408 --> 25:34.409
You're such a good boy!
You're such a good boy!

25:34.520 --> 25:36.888
Hello? This is Officer Tani Rey,

25:36.913 --> 25:39.539
Five-O. Does anyone copy?

25:40.500 --> 25:41.950
Tani! Tani, it's Steve. I got you.

25:41.975 --> 25:43.461
Oh, my God, I'm so
glad to hear your voice.

25:43.486 --> 25:45.506
- Steve!
- STEVE: Are you guys okay?

25:45.531 --> 25:47.899
What's going on? Tell me the
situation down there, please.

25:48.009 --> 25:49.343
Joons and I are good.

25:49.368 --> 25:52.637
We have two injured, one
woman, both her legs are broken.

25:52.662 --> 25:54.840
She's stable, but we have a
guy who's been electrocuted.

25:54.864 --> 25:56.050
What's his condition?

25:56.075 --> 25:57.909
He's not good. His-his
pulse is thready,

25:57.934 --> 25:59.679
he's starting to turn yellow.

25:59.704 --> 26:01.172
He needs immediate medical attention.

26:01.197 --> 26:04.357
Hold on, Tani. Keawe,
shut down the fans!

26:04.382 --> 26:05.391
What? Why?

26:05.416 --> 26:07.585
I'm gonna call you... I just...
Hold on. Keep your radio on.

26:07.610 --> 26:09.352
- Shut 'em down.
- That's insane. I can't do that.

26:09.377 --> 26:10.965
Listen to me. We need to
get all these people out.

26:10.990 --> 26:12.457
We need to do it right now, okay?

26:12.482 --> 26:14.827
The best way is to bring 'em up
through the ventilation system.

26:14.851 --> 26:18.163
You shut down those fans, they're
gonna run out of oxygen in 20 minutes.

26:18.188 --> 26:19.632
You said it yourself. This entire system

26:19.657 --> 26:22.959
could fail any minute.
Shut 'em down, let's go.

26:22.984 --> 26:24.384
Let's get to work right now.

26:24.409 --> 26:26.838
- Hey, Tani, you still there?
- Copy.

26:26.863 --> 26:28.330
Okay, listen to me.

26:28.398 --> 26:30.599
I got an idea, I need
you and Junior to listen

26:30.624 --> 26:32.124
very carefully, all right?

26:32.235 --> 26:35.103
Hey, Cindy, give us... give
us one minute, would you?

26:35.128 --> 26:37.182
Okay, uh, buddy, here's the thing:

26:37.207 --> 26:40.185
y-you're gonna bleed out
very soon, but we'll get you

26:40.210 --> 26:41.620
out of here, we just need you to tell us

26:41.644 --> 26:43.278
where, uh, Wilcox and his old lady went,

26:43.303 --> 26:44.447
and we'll get you right out of here.

26:44.472 --> 26:45.790
QUINN: I think you need to be

26:45.815 --> 26:47.115
a little more persuasive.

26:47.506 --> 26:50.328
- Okay, uh, I don't...
- ADAM: Danny. Quinn.

26:51.087 --> 26:53.956
Hey, nobody move him, okay?

26:55.992 --> 26:57.192
Toilet running?

26:57.303 --> 26:59.170
We got ourselves a burner phone.

26:59.826 --> 27:02.664
DANNY: It's got to be
Shayla Wilcox, right?

27:02.927 --> 27:04.227
Let's see.

27:05.478 --> 27:06.911
No, uh,

27:06.936 --> 27:09.571
no outgoing calls, texts onl... Wow.

27:09.596 --> 27:10.896
Whoa.

27:11.050 --> 27:12.517
Whoa.

27:12.542 --> 27:13.875
That's not exactly your friendly,

27:13.900 --> 27:15.286
"Hey, how are you doing?" kind of text.

27:15.311 --> 27:17.312
Look at that angle...
that's, uh... it's every...

27:17.337 --> 27:20.758
She sent at least a dozen
of these racy selfies

27:20.783 --> 27:22.284
to the same number.

27:22.352 --> 27:23.562
DANNY: Well, it couldn't
have been to Wilcox.

27:23.586 --> 27:26.154
I mean, the guy's under
constant surveillance, right?

27:26.222 --> 27:27.433
I mean, he probably
doesn't have a phone,

27:27.457 --> 27:28.500
and even if he does,
they're not letting him

27:28.524 --> 27:29.925
- text like this.
- Mmmmm.

27:30.035 --> 27:32.670
Looks like Mrs. Wilcox
has some 'splainin' to do.

27:32.695 --> 27:34.229
(phone rings)

27:37.109 --> 27:38.576
Lou, what do we got?

27:38.601 --> 27:41.145
So I just heard back from CSU.

27:41.544 --> 27:44.640
That blood found at the
tunnel exit is a familial match

27:44.707 --> 27:47.209
to Jackson Wilcox's
only living relative...

27:47.319 --> 27:48.686
His loving brother, Mike.

27:48.711 --> 27:50.245
Poor little Mikey.

27:50.270 --> 27:52.957
Took a bullet trying to
rescue his big brother.

27:53.211 --> 27:54.411
Brother, huh?

27:54.436 --> 27:56.385
Yeah, well, before you start handing out

27:56.410 --> 27:58.981
sibling of the year
awards, listen to this.

27:59.006 --> 28:02.209
Seems little Mikey flew
into HNL several days ago,

28:02.234 --> 28:03.840
traveling under an alias.

28:03.865 --> 28:07.773
He also purchased a couple
of commercial airline tickets

28:07.798 --> 28:09.533
leaving Oahu tonight.

28:09.558 --> 28:13.438
One for himself, and the
other one for a woman.

28:14.606 --> 28:16.974
Also traveling under an alias.

28:17.042 --> 28:18.609
That would be Wilcox's wife

28:18.634 --> 28:19.734
Shayla.

28:19.759 --> 28:20.826
That would be correct.

28:20.851 --> 28:23.453
So, how is her husband
getting off the island?

28:23.478 --> 28:25.366
Maybe that was never part of the plan.

28:25.391 --> 28:27.251
Lou, we're gonna need
you to run a phone number.

28:27.276 --> 28:28.276
You got it.

28:28.565 --> 28:30.120
Okay, uh, buddy, look,

28:30.145 --> 28:32.196
uh, you're all about loyalty.

28:32.221 --> 28:34.255
I understand that, okay?
But if that's the case,

28:34.280 --> 28:37.221
I got to let you know something:
your boss... he's about to die.

28:37.246 --> 28:39.594
All right? And you are the
only one that can help him.

28:39.619 --> 28:42.064
QUINN: See, Mike had a little
somethin' somethin' going on with

28:42.089 --> 28:44.423
Mrs. Wilcox.

28:44.533 --> 28:47.301
ADAM: Ah, you're a "see it to
believe it" kind of guy. Okay.

28:47.326 --> 28:48.799
In that case...

28:49.715 --> 28:51.015
How about that?

28:51.964 --> 28:54.409
She wasn't sending these to her husband.

28:54.519 --> 28:56.520
All these X-rated
photos were being sent

28:56.545 --> 28:59.214
to none other than your
boss's brother, Mike.

28:59.239 --> 29:00.966
QUINN: Here's the $25,000 question:

29:00.991 --> 29:02.192
If he's having an affair

29:02.217 --> 29:04.652
with his brother's wife,
why spring him from custody?

29:04.720 --> 29:06.354
I imagine they don't have anything good

29:06.379 --> 29:08.059
planned for the guy, right?

29:08.084 --> 29:10.858
The only way you can help
your boss now is by telling us

29:10.883 --> 29:12.809
where he was headed from here.

29:17.777 --> 29:19.834
WILCOX: Hard part's over now, babe.

29:19.859 --> 29:21.988
I got a plane fueled up.

29:22.237 --> 29:24.806
You and me, going to paradise.

29:24.873 --> 29:26.140
The Maldives.

29:26.208 --> 29:27.703
They got these resorts.

29:27.728 --> 29:30.463
The hotels are up on
stilts in the ocean.

29:30.806 --> 29:32.780
The floors are made out of glass.

29:32.805 --> 29:34.305
(rustling nearby)

29:39.426 --> 29:41.361
(grunts)

29:43.291 --> 29:45.092
What's going on, little brother?

29:48.123 --> 29:49.430
I get it, Mikey.

29:49.455 --> 29:51.189
Been living in my shadow a long time.

29:51.214 --> 29:53.334
Always were too dim to
build something of your own.

29:53.359 --> 29:55.787
It don't surprise me one bit
you'd come after what's mine.

29:55.812 --> 29:57.170
But you?

29:57.558 --> 29:59.759
I've loved you since we were 16.

30:00.084 --> 30:02.842
- I thought you were dead.
- Yeah.

30:03.324 --> 30:05.325
Well, I see you've moved on.

30:05.916 --> 30:07.558
So what happens now?

30:07.583 --> 30:08.883
MIKEY: I give you to Moreno.

30:08.951 --> 30:10.451
He paid some serious coin

30:10.476 --> 30:12.322
to have the pleasure
of killing you himself.

30:18.721 --> 30:19.921
Later, bro.

30:29.489 --> 30:31.490
(indistinct chatter)

30:34.780 --> 30:37.672
Coming down, guys. Coming down.

30:45.954 --> 30:48.089
Okay. Ready?

30:48.114 --> 30:49.766
Is she okay?

30:50.321 --> 30:52.093
She's afraid of heights.

30:52.239 --> 30:53.606
I'll talk to her.

30:57.809 --> 31:00.144
Hey. I know you're scared.

31:00.481 --> 31:02.248
But honey, I'm here.

31:02.971 --> 31:04.457
I'm here.

31:04.769 --> 31:06.036
We can do this.

31:06.275 --> 31:07.777
Together.

31:11.644 --> 31:13.447
Let's not fire the therapist, okay?

31:13.472 --> 31:16.037
I-I want to talk to him

31:16.062 --> 31:17.396
about how we got through this.

31:29.449 --> 31:31.893
- TANI: Ready.
- Let's bring him up. Let's bring him up.

31:32.081 --> 31:33.395
Let's go.

31:41.636 --> 31:44.071
We got you, sir, We got you, we got you.

31:44.381 --> 31:46.725
All right, all right.

31:53.335 --> 31:55.823
It's okay. You're gonna be fine.

31:55.891 --> 31:57.458
STEVE: Bring 'em up.

31:57.526 --> 31:58.993
Let's bring 'em up.

32:00.498 --> 32:01.665
(coughs)

32:09.649 --> 32:10.814
(coughs)

32:10.839 --> 32:13.140
Easy, we got you.

32:13.208 --> 32:14.275
You're okay.

32:14.343 --> 32:16.370
Boards aren't gonna
fit through the blades.

32:18.005 --> 32:19.305
I'll make some room.

32:23.413 --> 32:25.495
- Pull me up to the fan.
- Bring her up, guys.

32:25.520 --> 32:26.734
Bring her up, bring her up.

32:30.552 --> 32:32.153
(indistinct chatter)

32:39.418 --> 32:41.319
Watch out.

32:57.352 --> 32:58.986
It's okay, we got you, we got you.

33:00.522 --> 33:01.522
We got you.

33:02.967 --> 33:05.535
Go ahead, go ahead.

33:05.560 --> 33:07.105
All right? You're gonna be
okay. Everything's gonna be okay.

33:07.129 --> 33:08.296
We got you.

33:18.647 --> 33:20.148
(whimpers)

33:21.998 --> 33:23.351
Got you, buddy. I got you.

33:23.378 --> 33:25.046
I got you, I got you. Get his legs.

33:25.071 --> 33:26.972
Who's my big boy?

33:26.997 --> 33:30.399
Who's my good boy? I knew
you could do it, buddy.

33:33.455 --> 33:34.922
TANI: All right. Pull me up.

33:34.947 --> 33:37.228
All right, bring her up, guys.
Bring her up, bring her up.

33:41.830 --> 33:43.017
I got you.

33:43.042 --> 33:44.476
We got you.

33:49.709 --> 33:51.209
All right, Joons.

33:53.673 --> 33:54.775
Junior!

33:54.843 --> 33:57.276
(grunting)

33:57.301 --> 33:59.369
Junior! Junior! Junior!

34:00.515 --> 34:01.882
(yells) TANI: Junior!

34:04.119 --> 34:06.158
- Junior, can you hear me?
- Joons!

34:09.719 --> 34:12.788
- Junior! Junior!
- Joons, are you okay?

34:12.813 --> 34:15.849
Junior! I got to get down there.

34:15.916 --> 34:17.226
Getting you down is no
problem, but that line

34:17.251 --> 34:18.952
can't hold you and Officer Reigns.

34:18.976 --> 34:20.210
I'll do it.

34:20.235 --> 34:21.380
What do you mean, you'll do it?

34:21.405 --> 34:22.871
Well, do you have a better idea?

34:42.022 --> 34:43.909
Jackson, my man.

34:44.444 --> 34:46.112
I got to admit,

34:46.137 --> 34:48.405
when I heard the feds
killed you in that raid,

34:48.429 --> 34:49.696
I was pretty bummed.

34:50.199 --> 34:52.018
Much as we've beefed over the years,

34:52.043 --> 34:53.777
you always did keep me on my toes.

34:54.737 --> 34:57.639
And plus, I really wanted to be
the guy that put you in the ground.

34:57.664 --> 35:00.090
And thanks to your brother,
that's gonna happen.

35:00.407 --> 35:01.674
(chuckles softly)

35:04.746 --> 35:06.142
Still haven't gotten a handle

35:06.167 --> 35:07.667
on those nerves, Moreno. He always was

35:07.692 --> 35:09.378
one jumpy S.O.B.

35:09.515 --> 35:10.992
MORENO: Okay, no, no, no, no, no.

35:11.017 --> 35:12.418
This is too easy.

35:13.867 --> 35:15.942
I got plans for this one.

35:16.625 --> 35:18.154
Get him in the jeep.

35:18.420 --> 35:21.021
- (sirens wailing)
- (man shouts)

35:22.349 --> 35:25.718
- Take cover! Move, move!
- Five-O, drop your weapons!

35:43.504 --> 35:45.200
(gunfire continuing)

35:47.722 --> 35:49.189
Thanks.

35:53.050 --> 35:54.778
STEVE: We're coming, Joons.

35:56.908 --> 35:58.646
Easy...

35:59.887 --> 36:01.554
FIREMAN: Hold it steady.

36:10.324 --> 36:11.864
Okay, we're good. We're good.

36:11.889 --> 36:13.214
TANI: Joon, come on.

36:13.923 --> 36:16.179
Joons. Hey. Come on.

36:16.678 --> 36:17.638
(grunts)

36:17.663 --> 36:19.866
Let's go, Joons. Come on.
I'm getting you out of here.

36:22.204 --> 36:24.172
(coughs)

36:24.780 --> 36:26.681
TANI: I'm taking you home.

36:28.449 --> 36:30.717
All right, hold on, Joons.

36:30.742 --> 36:33.978
Okay. Okay! Pull us up! Go, go, go!

36:34.003 --> 36:36.284
All right, bring her up, guys.
Bring her up, bring her up.

36:40.635 --> 36:42.369
<i>ADAM: Okay, this is weird.</i>

36:42.394 --> 36:44.673
Wilcox couldn't have gotten
that much of a head start.

36:44.698 --> 36:48.086
Well, not unless he's
got incredible foot speed,

36:48.111 --> 36:50.112
- especially for a guy with cancer.
- Got something.

36:50.137 --> 36:51.304
Here we go.

36:55.898 --> 36:57.432
It's Mikey and Shayla.

36:57.457 --> 36:59.024
That was a short-lived romance.

37:02.030 --> 37:03.814
Bodies are cold to
the touch, which means

37:04.127 --> 37:06.347
it's been at least 20 minutes
since they were killed.

37:06.372 --> 37:08.626
So Wilcox could long gone.

37:21.520 --> 37:23.146
Hey, guys, listen. While we're all here,

37:23.170 --> 37:25.699
I just want to take this
opportunity to say, uh,

37:26.387 --> 37:27.607
great job.

37:27.675 --> 37:29.742
We locked up a bunch of bad guys.

37:29.767 --> 37:31.987
Hopefully some of them are
gonna roll on other bad guys

37:32.012 --> 37:34.414
and so on and so forth, so thank you.

37:34.439 --> 37:36.091
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

37:36.216 --> 37:38.318
JUNIOR: Now, uh, just
rolling off of that, um,

37:38.343 --> 37:42.043
I'm-a blame this concussion
for not having the right words,

37:42.068 --> 37:44.457
but, uh, thank you, guys.

37:44.525 --> 37:46.092
I really owe you guys a lot.

37:46.160 --> 37:47.560
No, you don't owe us anything.

37:47.628 --> 37:48.838
- (phone chimes)
- We're just happy you're okay.

37:48.862 --> 37:51.029
ADAM: Yo, just got a text from Duke.

37:51.545 --> 37:54.734
"Coast Guard recovered a
capsized boat near Kaneohe Bay.

37:54.759 --> 37:56.779
Owner reported the vessel stolen."

37:57.514 --> 37:59.138
DANNY: Well, that's very close

37:59.206 --> 38:00.907
to where Wilcox was last seen.

38:00.932 --> 38:03.634
Well, assuming he took it,
do you think he drowned?

38:03.659 --> 38:05.954
That'd be nice. You can't
bet on that, thought.

38:05.979 --> 38:07.980
JUNIOR: Yeah, me, neither.
I still can't believe

38:08.005 --> 38:10.092
that little brother tried
to steal big bro's business

38:10.117 --> 38:12.704
and his lady and then
sell him to his enemies.

38:12.729 --> 38:14.588
That-that's harsh.

38:14.613 --> 38:16.232
Yeah. It appears Wilcox is a lot smarter

38:16.256 --> 38:17.674
than people gave him credit for.

38:18.182 --> 38:21.427
GROVER: You know, as much as I love
shop talk... and I do... Can we stop

38:21.452 --> 38:23.053
with it already, please?

38:23.163 --> 38:24.097
It's smelling good out here.

38:24.122 --> 38:25.602
Chief, what you got over there for us?

38:25.627 --> 38:26.833
I got some dogs,

38:26.858 --> 38:28.448
some, uh, world-famous
McGarrett burgers

38:28.473 --> 38:30.512
and a little sirloin I
picked up from the butcher.

38:30.537 --> 38:31.914
DANNY: Don't overcook the steak.

38:31.939 --> 38:33.973
You overcook it, it
defeats its own purpose.

38:34.041 --> 38:35.799
I'll have mine medium-rare, please.

38:35.824 --> 38:37.853
No, there's no...
there's no steak for you.

38:37.878 --> 38:39.879
There's one steak. It's for...

38:39.904 --> 38:42.005
- Edward, right here.
- (barks)

38:42.116 --> 38:43.549
Eddie doesn't eat kibble?

38:43.617 --> 38:45.161
STEVE: He's got plenty of
kibble, but he's a hero today.

38:45.185 --> 38:46.986
I mean, this-this kid put goggles on

38:47.011 --> 38:49.031
and went into the trenches and

38:49.056 --> 38:50.690
saved a bunch of people.

38:50.715 --> 38:52.456
He gets a steak. He's my man.

38:52.481 --> 38:54.026
- DANNY: Gets a steak.
- Yeah?

38:54.066 --> 38:56.000
QUINN: Well, I don't have
any arguments with that.

38:56.025 --> 38:58.228
I mean, that little hero
helped rescue nine people

38:58.253 --> 38:59.539
from a collapsed tunnel.

38:59.564 --> 39:01.359
And helped save your ass from a bomb.

39:01.391 --> 39:03.209
- He deserves a steak.
- (barks)

39:03.269 --> 39:05.656
But what... I-I mean, I
didn't just, like, take a nap.

39:05.681 --> 39:08.040
I mean, we did a lot of stuff, too.
We, you know, took down

39:08.065 --> 39:09.466
a lot of bad guys.

39:09.491 --> 39:10.686
Uh, but no, it's fine.

39:10.711 --> 39:13.353
I'll have a, uh, an
under-seasoned burger.

39:14.481 --> 39:16.249
STEVE: Under-seasoned?

39:16.316 --> 39:17.583
Okay, how about you, uh,

39:17.651 --> 39:19.596
go and help yourself to
some heavily-seasoned bread

39:19.620 --> 39:20.930
and peanut butter, make
yourself a sandwich?

39:20.954 --> 39:22.922
- How about that?
- Nice.

39:22.947 --> 39:24.643
He didn't even offer you jelly, man.

39:24.869 --> 39:26.354
That's cold.

39:26.379 --> 39:29.729
Um, do you want a refill?

39:29.754 --> 39:31.674
No, I'm good. Thank you.

39:32.332 --> 39:33.833
- Hmm.
- What? What?

39:33.901 --> 39:35.535
What is that? Don't do that look.

39:35.602 --> 39:36.602
I'm being nice.

39:36.637 --> 39:37.789
The guy has a head injury.

39:37.814 --> 39:39.982
- I-I didn't say a thing.
- JUNIOR: Hey.

39:40.007 --> 39:42.275
You know what? I get foot rub.

39:42.300 --> 39:43.966
- Look at these...
- GROVER: No.

39:43.991 --> 39:46.546
(laughs): Okay. You're gross.

39:46.571 --> 39:47.823
You live here,

39:47.848 --> 39:49.810
you know where the fridge is.

39:49.835 --> 39:51.918
- Oh, uh, you live here with Steve?
- Yeah.

39:51.943 --> 39:53.644
Well, that's impressive.

39:53.754 --> 39:55.632
I've never liked any of my
coworkers enough to even grab

39:55.656 --> 39:57.776
a beer with them after work, let
alone share a house with them.

39:57.801 --> 39:59.468
DANNY: Mm, that might be saying Yep.

39:59.493 --> 40:01.260
Something more about your coworkers

40:01.328 --> 40:03.196
- than you.
- Mm. Touché.

40:03.263 --> 40:06.743
STEVE: Uh, copy that. Thank you.
Thank you very much. Bye-bye.

40:08.078 --> 40:09.478
That was the bomb squad.

40:09.503 --> 40:12.205
They just finished analyzing the device

40:12.272 --> 40:13.639
that was left in my house.

40:13.707 --> 40:16.309
No fingerprints, no DNA, nothing.

40:16.418 --> 40:18.353
GROVER: The bomb squad
can say whatever they want.

40:18.378 --> 40:19.412
We know it's Cullen, man.

40:19.480 --> 40:20.947
QUINN: Well, if you're right,

40:20.972 --> 40:22.406
you know he's gonna try it again.

40:22.969 --> 40:24.993
We can't sit around here
waiting for that to happen.

40:25.236 --> 40:27.859
Trust me, I'm not gonna do that.
