00:01.734 --> 00:03.305
Next, on Airwolf.

00:03.370 --> 00:04.371
You got any heat sources?

00:04.438 --> 00:05.473
Are they all dead?

00:05.539 --> 00:07.519
There are 2 Americans still alive.

00:07.574 --> 00:10.384
Send out every available man to take them.

00:10.444 --> 00:12.446
Whatever it is, it's obviously lethal.

00:12.513 --> 00:14.083
The Russians can't control it.

00:14.147 --> 00:17.026
We've got to find out
what is going on up there.

00:18.318 --> 00:19.490
Let's go. Come on.

00:21.154 --> 00:23.862
Call off your guards, or we're
all gonna die on this island.

00:24.858 --> 00:26.701
Cruise missiles Hawke, subsonic.

00:26.760 --> 00:28.330
Hawke, you got to hold on.

00:30.000 --> 00:36.074

01:44.338 --> 01:46.944
Help! Somebody, help!

01:51.445 --> 01:52.480
Help!

01:52.546 --> 01:55.686
No! No, no! Stay away!
Stay away! Stay away!

01:55.816 --> 01:57.295
Get back! Get back! Get back!

02:13.367 --> 02:14.937
No!

02:22.643 --> 02:24.919
Everything got out of hand.

02:24.978 --> 02:26.855
No time left.

02:26.913 --> 02:31.658
Sickness spreads like wildfire.

02:33.286 --> 02:35.288
Some die

02:37.124 --> 02:38.535
immediately.

02:39.626 --> 02:41.264
There's madness,

02:42.295 --> 02:43.672
paranoia.

02:47.601 --> 02:52.482
Time is running out for us.

02:58.979 --> 03:01.084
It started in Afghanistan,

03:01.915 --> 03:04.691
but we're not sure the Soviet
military authorized it.

03:04.751 --> 03:06.025
In fact, there's some evidence

03:06.086 --> 03:10.000
that it was an accident or a rogue operation.

03:10.457 --> 03:12.494
The results are the same.

03:13.260 --> 03:15.831
It seems to be biological in nature.

03:15.896 --> 03:17.466
Probably viral.

03:17.798 --> 03:20.972
We've never seen microorganisms this powerful.

03:21.034 --> 03:22.877
In any case, no matter what the agent is,

03:22.936 --> 03:25.610
it's odorless, colorless

03:26.773 --> 03:28.411
and obviously lethal.

03:32.112 --> 03:34.922
Our agents in Kabul grabbed
a vial of the stuff,

03:35.849 --> 03:38.090
had it sent to a super-secret installation

03:38.151 --> 03:40.654
we set up at an old World
War II spotting station

03:40.721 --> 03:42.064
in the Aleutians.

03:42.122 --> 03:43.362
It's an isolated island

03:43.423 --> 03:46.370
where we could duplicate
the Afghanistan conditions.

03:46.426 --> 03:49.464
They were trying to create
a counter-agent, an antidote.

03:49.529 --> 03:51.031
You say they were?

03:51.098 --> 03:52.168
Right.

03:52.232 --> 03:54.940
They were also supposed to report regularly.

03:56.103 --> 04:00.347
So far, this is all we've
heard for the past 72 hours.

04:05.545 --> 04:07.456
Sounds like some kind of a code.

04:07.514 --> 04:10.017
Whatever it is, it's coming in
over their assigned frequency,

04:10.083 --> 04:11.960
and we can't break it.

04:13.687 --> 04:15.564
Why don't you just send a team up there?

04:15.622 --> 04:17.124
We already have.

04:17.724 --> 04:19.101
4 men.

04:19.159 --> 04:21.298
They haven't reported back.

04:22.529 --> 04:24.600
So, you're saying the bacteria's escaped?

04:24.664 --> 04:26.871
Now, we don't know what happened.

04:26.933 --> 04:29.004
When is Santini coming back?

04:29.069 --> 04:30.309
3, 4 weeks.

04:30.370 --> 04:32.714
We've got to find out what the
hell is going on up there.

04:32.773 --> 04:35.219
That's why we need Airwolf, and we need it now.

04:50.357 --> 04:52.837
These pictures from Afghanistan
are horrible, Hawke.

04:52.893 --> 04:54.338
Well, I wanted you to know

04:54.394 --> 04:56.305
what you might be getting yourself into.

04:56.363 --> 04:58.036
Hawke, they make me furious.

04:58.098 --> 04:59.941
Then why do you keep looking at them?

05:00.000 --> 05:02.674
Because if I'm angry, I won't be scared.

05:02.736 --> 05:03.908
Are ya?

05:03.970 --> 05:05.506
No.

05:05.572 --> 05:06.812
So am I.

05:12.212 --> 05:14.158
Position?

05:14.881 --> 05:16.554
Coming up on the island now, Hawke.

05:16.983 --> 05:18.291
Got it.

05:21.488 --> 05:23.161
Let's take her in.

05:27.127 --> 05:29.368
All quadrants clear.

05:31.264 --> 05:32.675
Here it is.

05:47.347 --> 05:48.758
Nothing's moving.

05:48.815 --> 05:50.419
Try the audio.

05:59.626 --> 06:01.572
Nothing. Just that same transmission

06:01.628 --> 06:04.632
that we've been picking up ever since we left.

06:04.998 --> 06:07.239
Hawke, look at all the bodies.

06:21.815 --> 06:23.590
You got any heat sources?

06:23.650 --> 06:25.823
No readings at all?

06:25.886 --> 06:27.593
Are they all dead?

06:29.990 --> 06:33.301
Yeah, they're all dead.

06:40.233 --> 06:42.338
I think we ought to set her down in the hills.

07:34.621 --> 07:36.862
Hawke, look at all the bodies.

07:37.524 --> 07:40.437
It's like a nightmare, Hawke.
Almost as though they…

07:40.493 --> 07:42.439
They killed one another.

07:43.330 --> 07:46.334
Hawke, this man's been shot.

07:46.399 --> 07:49.243
Yeah, by this one over here.

07:54.074 --> 07:57.021
The signal's too erratic,
Hawke. I can't trace it.

07:58.211 --> 08:00.851
If anyone's still alive,

08:01.114 --> 08:04.118
we'll locate them at the source of the signal.

08:29.376 --> 08:30.855
Stay here.

08:30.910 --> 08:32.821
Not me.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.889
Hey, found a light switch.

08:47.427 --> 08:49.771
Caitlin, take it easy.

09:17.757 --> 09:20.294
This looks like the main power plant.

09:24.664 --> 09:26.871
It's just like outside.

09:26.933 --> 09:28.276
It looks like…

09:28.334 --> 09:29.813
like they killed each other.

09:29.869 --> 09:33.476
They're all covered with those
same kind of sores, Hawke.

09:34.407 --> 09:36.250
Like those poor people.

09:36.309 --> 09:38.949
You know, the ones in Afghanistan.

09:39.412 --> 09:40.652
Hawke…

09:41.114 --> 09:42.787
I need to get out of here, Hawke.

09:42.849 --> 09:44.954
You're hyperventilating.

09:45.018 --> 09:47.692
Breathe easy. Listen, we'll get out this way.

09:47.754 --> 09:49.028
Sing a song.

09:51.958 --> 09:55.337
♪ Mary had a little lamb ♪

09:55.962 --> 09:57.498
♪ A little lamb ♪

09:57.564 --> 09:59.100
♪ Little lamb ♪

09:59.165 --> 10:00.303
♪ Mary had a… ♪

10:04.037 --> 10:06.039
Monsters!

10:35.635 --> 10:36.705
No!

10:37.704 --> 10:39.047
Stay away.

10:39.339 --> 10:41.376
No, we need him alive.

10:41.441 --> 10:43.216
Don't touch me!

10:55.054 --> 10:56.294
Hawke.

10:56.356 --> 10:58.336
Hawke, we're exposed.

10:58.391 --> 10:59.995
He cracked my visor.

11:00.059 --> 11:02.039
My suit's torn, too.

11:02.095 --> 11:04.234
Whatever it is, we're in this together.

11:04.297 --> 11:06.106
Hawke, let's get out of these suits quick.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.168
We got to catch that guy.

11:21.314 --> 11:22.725
Don't!

12:15.568 --> 12:17.605
Hawke, he jumped.

12:21.074 --> 12:22.985
All we wanted to do was help him.

12:23.042 --> 12:25.022
He's too far gone to understand.

12:25.078 --> 12:26.148
Do you see him?

12:26.212 --> 12:28.249
No, where'd he go?

12:29.382 --> 12:30.759
Like he just walked away.

12:30.817 --> 12:32.728
Oh Hawke, after that fall?

12:33.686 --> 12:35.723
Well, he couldn't live through it.

12:43.396 --> 12:45.069
Look.

12:45.665 --> 12:46.803
Get down.

12:46.866 --> 12:47.867
Why? Who are they?

12:48.568 --> 12:50.070
Russians.

12:50.136 --> 12:51.672
How do you know?

12:54.207 --> 12:56.949
That's a Soviet sub out there.

12:58.678 --> 13:01.181
And that's not the worst part of it.

13:02.415 --> 13:03.894
We can't get to Airwolf.

13:20.700 --> 13:22.680
What are they doing here?

13:23.236 --> 13:26.342
Don't they know they've exposed
themselves to that disease?

13:26.406 --> 13:29.285
Well, they probably heard about the
research facility on this island,

13:29.342 --> 13:32.983
and they're looking for the
same thing we are, an antidote.

13:34.180 --> 13:36.126
Hawke, that's a Russian sub in our waters.

13:36.182 --> 13:38.822
Now, shouldn't somebody know about that?

13:41.554 --> 13:44.034
We gotta find that antidote first.

13:45.358 --> 13:48.100
We'll take care of that when
we get to Airwolf. Come on.

14:08.781 --> 14:11.728
I think they're looking for
the source of the signal.

14:11.784 --> 14:13.855
Well, we couldn't find it, Hawke. How can they?

14:13.920 --> 14:15.331
They won't.

14:16.856 --> 14:19.268
Those hills are full of iron ore.

14:20.827 --> 14:22.067
It deflects the ground signals.

14:22.128 --> 14:24.438
They couldn't find the
source without an aircraft.

14:24.497 --> 14:27.239
They don't have an aircraft Hawke, we do.

14:31.604 --> 14:33.379
Yeah, that's right.

14:34.207 --> 14:36.118
Well, what do we do now?

14:37.844 --> 14:41.121
Well, if push comes to shove,
we do whatever we have to.

14:41.180 --> 14:42.250
In the meantime,

14:42.315 --> 14:44.989
I'm gonna try and find
a way through to Airwolf.

14:45.051 --> 14:46.553
You stay here.

14:47.053 --> 14:48.396
Stay warm.

14:52.558 --> 14:54.060
Are you okay?

14:54.861 --> 14:56.204
You're sure?

14:56.262 --> 14:57.570
I'm fine.

15:24.223 --> 15:26.396
Hey, hey, take it easy, sailor.

15:28.227 --> 15:29.501
Hands up!

15:30.797 --> 15:33.175
Hey, this is no Western movie.

15:33.900 --> 15:35.038
Walk!

15:38.905 --> 15:40.316
Sure.

15:40.840 --> 15:42.842
Well, how did you happen to get into

15:42.909 --> 15:45.219
the land of designer jeans here?

15:45.845 --> 15:48.018
You do know this is US territory?

15:50.983 --> 15:52.087
Hey, look.

15:52.151 --> 15:54.290
I'm trying to be cordial.

15:54.353 --> 15:55.696
But if you want to get uptight…

16:04.096 --> 16:07.202
Let's get out of here. His friends
must have heard the shot.

16:34.827 --> 16:35.828
Benny.

16:35.895 --> 16:39.308
Benny! Come here!

16:39.365 --> 16:42.039
This man needs attention. Now!

16:42.101 --> 16:43.205
Send him back to the sub.

16:43.269 --> 16:46.842
We can't do that, Commander.
This may be the contagion.

16:46.906 --> 16:48.078
He may be infected.

16:48.140 --> 16:51.451
We have no facilities to treat
him on this beach, Lieutenant.

16:51.511 --> 16:53.548
If we send him aboard the sub,

16:53.613 --> 16:55.388
the whole fleet may be infected.

16:55.448 --> 16:57.223
Who knows where it will end?

17:00.753 --> 17:02.096
Very well.

17:02.154 --> 17:05.032
Tell the Medical Officer to do what he can.

17:07.460 --> 17:08.939
And now Lieutenant,

17:08.994 --> 17:12.204
let's find out whether the Americans
have discovered the antidote.

17:12.265 --> 17:14.905
Aren't you forgetting something, Commander?

17:14.967 --> 17:16.275
If we should die,

17:16.335 --> 17:20.010
these facilities will continue
to harbor the contagion.

17:20.071 --> 17:22.313
For months, even years.

17:25.744 --> 17:28.281
Lieutenant Commander Alexandrov.

17:28.347 --> 17:31.521
We are showing early symptoms of the disease.

17:31.584 --> 17:33.188
If a pattern develops,

17:33.252 --> 17:37.166
I may be forced to initiate strike plan beta.

17:37.857 --> 17:41.361
Make the necessary corrections
in missile trajectories

17:41.427 --> 17:44.135
and wait for further instructions, over.

17:45.965 --> 17:47.308
Don't worry, Lieutenant.

17:47.366 --> 17:51.678
If we die here, I'll make sure
this organism dies with us.

17:52.572 --> 17:53.983
Commander Zhukov.

17:54.040 --> 17:55.451
Torgovitch.

17:55.508 --> 17:58.318
Sir, there are 2 Americans still alive.

17:58.811 --> 18:00.518
Where? Near the cliffs, sir.

18:00.580 --> 18:02.059
They evaded the capture.

18:02.114 --> 18:05.323
Send out every available man to take them.

18:05.384 --> 18:08.991
Delay that. Our first priority
is to find that antidote.

18:09.956 --> 18:13.494
If the Americans report our presence here,

18:13.559 --> 18:16.233
it could create an international incident.

18:16.295 --> 18:17.638
If we don't find that antidote,

18:17.697 --> 18:19.802
we won't be alive to worry about it.

18:19.865 --> 18:21.208
Dismissed.

18:31.744 --> 18:32.814
Get down.

18:32.878 --> 18:34.789
They're coming this way.

18:35.848 --> 18:37.850
Let's take cover in here.

19:03.643 --> 19:04.849
Hawke.

19:05.311 --> 19:06.415
Jennings Rudolph.

19:06.479 --> 19:08.083
Head of the research team.

19:09.315 --> 19:11.022
Whatever he knew, he took it with him. Come on.

19:29.769 --> 19:30.907
Cate.

19:31.404 --> 19:32.610
Thanks.

20:08.274 --> 20:09.514
Caitlin!

20:10.209 --> 20:11.313
Look.

20:12.578 --> 20:14.353
It's a video camera.

20:15.548 --> 20:16.652
Here.

20:31.530 --> 20:34.238
…running out for us.

20:39.805 --> 20:41.478
Whoever you are,

20:42.174 --> 20:44.381
whether you know it or not,

20:44.610 --> 20:46.886
you're dying, too. All of us.

20:49.582 --> 20:51.755
The world is dying.

20:54.019 --> 20:56.431
I have an urge to kill

20:58.057 --> 20:59.331
myself.

21:00.426 --> 21:02.428
To kill, to kill…

21:03.028 --> 21:06.874
kill… kill other people.

21:14.039 --> 21:15.541
A psychotic

21:16.041 --> 21:17.384
paranoid

21:17.443 --> 21:20.356
team in the secure lab

21:20.412 --> 21:22.949
thought they had it licked.

21:23.015 --> 21:24.426
Secure lab?

21:25.718 --> 21:27.288
Oh, Margaret,

21:30.556 --> 21:31.933
I love you.

21:33.025 --> 21:34.265
Kids,

21:34.660 --> 21:36.697
Stephen, Lucy,

21:36.762 --> 21:38.366
I love you, too.

21:47.206 --> 21:48.708
Are you okay?

21:49.074 --> 21:51.782
I'm okay. I'm okay.

21:54.246 --> 21:55.486
Maybe…

21:56.382 --> 21:59.386
maybe we've got a chance if
we can find that secure lab.

21:59.451 --> 22:02.557
I think that's a job you
can safely leave to us.

22:08.327 --> 22:10.568
Lower your weapons, everybody.

22:15.968 --> 22:17.038
I'm Leoni Zlrukov,

22:17.102 --> 22:19.776
Commander of the Soviet
Oceanographic Research Vessel,

22:19.839 --> 22:21.443
Maxim Gorky.

22:21.507 --> 22:23.578
This is Lieutenant Elena Loupani,

22:23.642 --> 22:24.780
our Political Officer.

22:24.844 --> 22:25.879
What's the matter, Commander?

22:25.945 --> 22:28.448
You take a wrong turn when
you got to the North Pole?

22:28.514 --> 22:30.687
This man, Professor Rudolph.

22:30.749 --> 22:32.956
He spoke about a secure laboratory.

22:33.018 --> 22:34.759
What can you tell us about it?

22:34.820 --> 22:37.198
I can tell you that this
is United States territory.

22:37.256 --> 22:39.532
And whatever's here belongs to us.

22:39.592 --> 22:40.866
Turn on that machine.

22:40.926 --> 22:42.633
Don't bother.

22:42.695 --> 22:44.766
There's nothing on that tape

22:44.830 --> 22:46.605
that says anything about an antidote,

22:46.665 --> 22:48.906
which is what we're both after.

22:51.904 --> 22:53.906
How could you use a weapon like that?

22:53.973 --> 22:56.317
You don't even have an antidote!

22:56.742 --> 22:59.382
It may not have been an official test.

23:00.746 --> 23:03.022
Regardless, such an antidote,

23:03.816 --> 23:06.922
if it exists, is the property
of the Soviet Union.

23:06.986 --> 23:08.988
If such an antidote does exist,

23:09.054 --> 23:11.261
it's the property of the world.

23:11.323 --> 23:12.927
The whole world.

23:13.259 --> 23:16.433
One big family of man. Global cooperation.

23:17.196 --> 23:20.803
I had no idea American operatives
harbored such idealism.

23:21.600 --> 23:24.444
Not idealism, survival.

23:25.571 --> 23:27.278
In the long run, perhaps.

23:27.339 --> 23:29.876
But right now, tell us what you know.

23:40.552 --> 23:41.895
Commander,

23:43.322 --> 23:45.529
for us, there is no long run.

24:06.078 --> 24:07.648
So it is agreed, Mr. Hawke,

24:07.713 --> 24:10.922
that we will help each
other to find the antidote.

24:14.987 --> 24:16.159
Right.

24:16.622 --> 24:20.468
These mountains are full of a magnetic
ore that deflects all the signals.

24:20.526 --> 24:22.904
We have to find the source
of that transmission.

24:22.962 --> 24:25.465
Narrowing each time,
until we close the triangle.

24:25.831 --> 24:29.244
In order to do that, you have
to get above the mountains.

24:29.301 --> 24:31.144
There is no aircraft on this island.

24:31.203 --> 24:34.309
None we have been able to locate.

24:34.773 --> 24:36.377
Caitlin, show them the readings

24:36.442 --> 24:38.752
we took on the approach to the island.

24:42.915 --> 24:45.156
Our strongest readings came from here and here.

24:45.217 --> 24:46.890
These 2 vectors.

24:48.287 --> 24:49.766
And yours?

24:49.822 --> 24:51.301
Show them our readings.

24:51.357 --> 24:53.303
If this is a trick Commander,

24:53.359 --> 24:55.862
I wouldn't want to be in your place.

25:00.899 --> 25:04.574
If we find anybody following
us, our whole agreement's off.

25:05.137 --> 25:06.775
You have my word.

25:06.905 --> 25:09.010
Our first communication is 1400 hours.

25:09.074 --> 25:12.715
Let's check in, 13:25, 10 seconds,

25:14.013 --> 25:16.823
20 seconds, 30 seconds.

25:17.216 --> 25:18.422
Check.

25:18.817 --> 25:20.797
Hawke, good luck to you.

25:21.920 --> 25:24.867
And to wherever you've got
that aircraft hidden,

25:24.923 --> 25:28.996
if we see you are attempting to
escape this island's airspace,

25:29.762 --> 25:32.766
I'll order the sub to blow you out of the sky.

25:41.340 --> 25:42.580
Come on.

25:51.150 --> 25:53.687
Hawke, can we count on them to share
that antidote once we find it?

25:53.752 --> 25:56.130
Listen, we're dying, so are they.

25:56.789 --> 26:00.293
It's just odd that we find
ourselves a little more alike

26:00.392 --> 26:01.996
all of a sudden.

26:02.561 --> 26:04.165
You got a point.

26:06.131 --> 26:07.872
Get the radios ready.

26:07.933 --> 26:11.039
Notify the sub to triangulate
all transmissions.

26:14.306 --> 26:16.786
We should have taken them prisoner.

26:16.842 --> 26:19.083
All we need is their aircraft.

26:20.279 --> 26:23.089
We need their ability to fly it, too.

26:23.615 --> 26:25.617
We need each other.

26:26.051 --> 26:28.463
Is that so hard for you to grasp?

26:29.154 --> 26:31.293
It's not something we do easily.

26:31.557 --> 26:34.231
It's not part of our system, is it?

26:35.360 --> 26:39.308
If it were, would each submarine
have a Political Officer?

26:43.869 --> 26:46.213
Have I gone too far, Comrade?

26:49.508 --> 26:53.581
Perhaps having a fatal illness
loosens the tongue too much.

27:01.019 --> 27:03.056
I am not your enemy, Leoni.

27:05.724 --> 27:07.260
I know, Elena.

27:08.193 --> 27:09.536
I never thought so.

27:19.304 --> 27:21.181
Oh, fantastic!

27:31.650 --> 27:33.152
Look at them down there, Hawke!

27:33.218 --> 27:34.754
I bet their mouths are watering.

27:38.457 --> 27:39.527
Give me turbos.

27:39.591 --> 27:40.592
Turbos.

27:44.062 --> 27:48.442
Coming up on point one. We've got
the signal strong, 26°.

27:48.500 --> 27:50.878
Take heading 160, now.

28:01.446 --> 28:03.050
The signal's coming out like spaghetti.

28:07.452 --> 28:10.797
We have got an erratic signal
from 15° approximately.

28:13.425 --> 28:14.529
Got it.

28:21.366 --> 28:24.108
Signal at 2nd station, 205°.

28:27.306 --> 28:30.253
Our sub is attempting
triangulation of your data,

28:30.309 --> 28:33.085
but so far we haven't been
able to pinpoint the source.

28:39.218 --> 28:41.357
Bull's-eye. We found it, Hawke.

28:41.720 --> 28:43.700
We've got something, Zlrukov.

28:43.755 --> 28:44.825
Good!

28:46.892 --> 28:49.338
I have a fix, Lieutenant, 300°.

28:49.394 --> 28:52.500
This is the place. Get moving.

29:14.486 --> 29:16.796
I got some vehicles on the move down there.

29:16.855 --> 29:18.857
They're trying to beat us
to the source of the signal.

29:19.324 --> 29:20.928
I told you they couldn't be trusted, Hawke,

29:20.993 --> 29:22.597
but I sure wish I would've been wrong.

29:23.195 --> 29:25.266
Well, don't worry, we can slow ‘em down.

29:44.916 --> 29:46.759
Give me the ADF pods.

30:08.106 --> 30:10.416
What's the hurry, guys?

30:10.475 --> 30:12.921
Go ahead, the walk will do
you good. See you up there.

30:50.682 --> 30:53.891
A dangerous game you played
back there, Mr. Hawke.

30:54.319 --> 30:57.027
If you hadn't moved so prematurely, Commander,

30:57.089 --> 30:58.625
there would've been no reason.

31:17.909 --> 31:19.183
Nikolai!

31:57.015 --> 31:58.392
Commander.

31:58.683 --> 32:01.823
I insist. American property.

33:01.079 --> 33:02.490
Looks like a dead end.

33:05.484 --> 33:06.895
Wait a minute, Hawke.

33:06.952 --> 33:09.831
When Zeppo was with the act,
there were 4 Marx brothers.

33:09.888 --> 33:13.097
Right. Groucho, Chico,

33:13.625 --> 33:16.572
Zeppo and…

33:17.996 --> 33:19.270
Harpo.

33:20.265 --> 33:21.767
You're right, Comrade.

33:24.603 --> 33:27.846
There's got to be a 4th rabbit. Let's find it.

33:30.141 --> 33:31.347
Come on, Harpo.

33:37.616 --> 33:38.856
Harpo!

34:11.483 --> 34:13.190
Hello, little fellow.

34:14.351 --> 34:17.594
Hey, I found Harpo, and he's alive.

34:28.867 --> 34:29.971
This…

34:37.641 --> 34:40.851
This must be the source
of our mysterious signal.

34:43.481 --> 34:44.619
Look.

34:47.719 --> 34:51.757
"Anti-virus B. Harpo."

34:53.958 --> 34:56.940
"Anti-virus B. Harpo."

35:01.099 --> 35:02.635
I'll take the first injection.

35:03.935 --> 35:07.849
If there is any doubt,
we'll know it soon enough.

36:45.303 --> 36:48.147
You are more of an adversary than I expected.

36:51.109 --> 36:54.921
Well Lieutenant, learn not
to underestimate people.

36:56.014 --> 36:58.187
I found they can surprise you.

37:00.719 --> 37:02.392
Congratulations, Mr. Hawke.

37:02.454 --> 37:06.061
You, Miss Caitlin, and
Lieutenant Loupani are the last.

37:07.792 --> 37:09.999
Go on Hawke, give him
your arm like a big boy.

37:10.061 --> 37:11.734
Doesn't hurt much.

37:14.232 --> 37:15.643
All is well.

37:16.367 --> 37:19.780
Is it, Zlrukov? Some of your men are missing.

37:21.506 --> 37:23.076
Hawke, what's the matter?

37:23.141 --> 37:25.087
There's a scouting party in the hills.

37:25.944 --> 37:28.857
You just couldn't leave well enough
alone, could you, Commander?

37:29.814 --> 37:32.727
Lieutenant, I haven't ordered that.

37:33.718 --> 37:36.824
I took it into my own hands, Commander.

37:36.888 --> 37:40.097
You seem to have forgotten
where your duties lie.

37:40.458 --> 37:42.699
The technology in your aircraft,

37:42.761 --> 37:45.833
it's too important not to take
it back to the Soviet Union.

37:45.897 --> 37:47.638
Well, it doesn't really matter.

37:47.699 --> 37:50.646
Anyone that even touches that aircraft but me

37:50.702 --> 37:52.443
will find it'll blow itself

37:52.504 --> 37:55.781
and anyone within a 100-yard
radius straight to hell.

37:56.207 --> 37:57.686
It's a bluff.

37:59.611 --> 38:01.181
Is it, Lieutenant?

38:03.681 --> 38:06.457
Call me. I'll give you the keys myself.

38:08.753 --> 38:09.993
Hawke, look!

38:16.528 --> 38:19.975
I'm Dr. Charles Morton,

38:20.231 --> 38:22.734
endocrobiology.

38:23.568 --> 38:26.139
Stringfellow Hawke. I met you earlier.

38:27.372 --> 38:30.216
I'm sorry, I don't recall.

38:31.843 --> 38:34.983
I don't think you were exactly
in your best frame of mind.

38:35.046 --> 38:36.889
You look awfully cold.

38:39.517 --> 38:40.621
Thank you.

38:40.685 --> 38:45.156
Our comrades came here for the same
reason we did, to find the antidote.

38:46.191 --> 38:49.434
Fortunately, we managed to
locate it in the nick of time.

38:50.228 --> 38:52.208
You've all taken the serum?

38:52.263 --> 38:53.503
Yes.

38:53.565 --> 38:54.805
Doctor, if you had the antidote,

38:54.866 --> 38:56.777
why are you the only one that survived?

38:56.835 --> 38:59.076
Because the others killed each other.

38:59.137 --> 39:01.708
The antidote causes acute paranoia.

39:25.430 --> 39:27.205
My God, it's beginning.

39:27.265 --> 39:29.370
A side effect of the antidote.

39:29.434 --> 39:31.914
Almost as deadly as the disease itself.

39:31.970 --> 39:34.917
Doctor, are there tranquilizers in the lab?

39:36.107 --> 39:37.211
Yes.

39:37.508 --> 39:41.752
If we were to tranquilize each of
you for the next 8 to 10 hours,

39:41.980 --> 39:44.221
then the paranoid phase will pass.

39:44.282 --> 39:47.422
Not me! Nobody touches me!

40:00.899 --> 40:04.506
All of you, throw your
weapons in the ocean, now!

40:06.037 --> 40:08.574
He's right. Do as Hawke says.

40:09.307 --> 40:12.220
You wanna end up like Dr.
Morton's research team? Now!

40:14.045 --> 40:15.490
I order you!

40:21.386 --> 40:23.332
I'll get the sedatives.

40:30.028 --> 40:32.008
What about the patrol guarding Airwolf?

40:32.063 --> 40:33.770
They obey just my orders.

40:33.831 --> 40:35.708
Well then, order ‘em.

40:37.602 --> 40:38.740
No.

40:39.637 --> 40:42.243
Stop. Stop it. Stop it.

40:44.175 --> 40:45.882
Now I understand.

40:47.111 --> 40:52.060
That's a trap. That's an American trap!

40:52.250 --> 40:56.824
There are warplanes, tanks, all around us!

40:56.888 --> 40:58.526
All around us!

40:59.123 --> 41:00.397
Stop him.

41:00.858 --> 41:04.806
This is your Commander! This is
your Commander! It's a trap!

41:04.862 --> 41:07.001
Execute plan beta!

41:07.065 --> 41:08.476
Stop him!

41:10.601 --> 41:12.012
What is plan beta?

41:12.070 --> 41:13.378
A purgative air strike.

41:13.438 --> 41:17.352
This whole side of the island will
be incinerated by cruise missiles.

41:17.408 --> 41:18.682
How long?

41:19.410 --> 41:21.617
20 to 30 minutes, at most.

41:23.948 --> 41:25.291
Let's get Airwolf.

41:41.632 --> 41:43.134
You're right.

41:43.668 --> 41:45.579
Submarine is submerging.

41:46.637 --> 41:49.174
No, Captain wouldn't leave us here.

41:49.640 --> 41:52.246
Don't worry, my friends.

41:52.710 --> 41:55.281
Hey, nothing can harm us
anymore. We have antidote.

41:55.346 --> 41:57.758
We have taken an antidote. Nothing.

42:00.018 --> 42:03.693
Torgovitch, you and your men step forward

42:04.355 --> 42:06.460
and throw down your arms.

42:07.592 --> 42:09.936
We have to give you a tranquilizer.

42:09.994 --> 42:11.905
But, Lieutenant, your orders were to…

42:11.963 --> 42:14.842
Do as I say, Torgovitch. There is no time!

42:15.366 --> 42:17.642
There is a side effect to the antidote.

42:22.573 --> 42:25.281
I know what you're trying to make me do.

42:25.476 --> 42:27.752
You're trying make me to betray.

42:28.179 --> 42:30.352
Torgovitch, please.

42:30.648 --> 42:34.152
You! She is one of them! Them!

42:34.719 --> 42:37.859
One of the enemy. Don't you see this?

42:38.222 --> 42:39.963
I'm going to stop you.

42:45.129 --> 42:46.233
Torgovitch.

42:59.210 --> 43:03.124
Set detonation for 3-mile
spread. Come to firing depth.

43:05.683 --> 43:09.062
Hawke, can you fly tranquilized
like this? Can you even see?

43:09.587 --> 43:11.362
I gotta try.

43:27.438 --> 43:28.712
Do you read anything?

43:28.773 --> 43:31.652
That sub could be anywhere
in 1,000 square miles, Hawke.

43:31.709 --> 43:33.655
We're never gonna find it in time.

43:33.711 --> 43:36.089
Then we'll just have to be ready
and see when they pitch at us.

43:36.614 --> 43:38.560
Some batting practice.

43:46.190 --> 43:47.999
Hawke, they pitched us three.

43:48.059 --> 43:49.732
Cate, hit the ID.

43:54.098 --> 43:56.442
Cruise missiles Hawke, subsonic.

43:56.567 --> 43:58.137
Code name, Seasnake.

44:10.815 --> 44:13.022
Cate, where's the other ones?

44:13.084 --> 44:16.088
20° degrees, Hawke. Hawke, are you all right?

44:17.555 --> 44:19.296
Hawke, you gotta hold on.

44:19.357 --> 44:21.530
The missiles are only seconds from the target.

44:49.153 --> 44:52.066
Hawke, now. There's no time, Hawke.

44:58.930 --> 45:01.137
Now! Now! There's no time, Hawke!

45:06.337 --> 45:09.477
String, you got ‘em. We're gonna be all right.

45:10.675 --> 45:11.949
Thanks.

45:32.663 --> 45:35.439
You both took a big chance for us. I…

45:37.201 --> 45:38.737
I won't forget it.

45:39.070 --> 45:41.516
Neither will I, but I'm gonna try.

45:42.106 --> 45:43.551
Till next time.

45:46.911 --> 45:50.085
I keep thinking about
that man on the television.

45:50.915 --> 45:52.622
Professor Rudolph.

45:52.950 --> 45:57.831
He said, "Sometimes the weapons we
create are worse than we ourselves."

45:59.056 --> 46:02.594
I think we have proved that here.

46:16.874 --> 46:18.979
We've got one last job to do.

46:19.043 --> 46:20.716
Sterilize this island.

46:35.893 --> 46:37.463
Goodbye, my friends.

46:38.562 --> 46:39.905
I'm sorry.

47:10.428 --> 47:11.532
Let's go home.

47:12.305 --> 47:18.822
