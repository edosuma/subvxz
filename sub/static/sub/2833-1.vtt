01:46.620 --> 01:48.660
You better get married soon.

01:49.260 --> 01:52.180
You're starting to look old.

01:53.740 --> 01:56.700
My dad has been saying that to me
since I was 15...

01:56.780 --> 02:00.140
because nice Greek girls are supposed
to do three things in life.

02:00.220 --> 02:03.980
Marry Greek boys, make Greek babies,
and feed everyone...

02:04.420 --> 02:06.140
until the day we die.

02:55.980 --> 02:58.940
When I was growing up,
I knew I was different.

02:59.540 --> 03:02.180
The other girls were blond and delicate.

03:02.620 --> 03:05.540
And I was a swarthy 6-year-old
with sideburns.

03:05.700 --> 03:08.140
I so badly wanted to be
like the popular girls...

03:08.340 --> 03:10.380
all sitting together, talking...

03:10.700 --> 03:13.180
eating their Wonder Bread sandwiches.

03:13.540 --> 03:14.860
What's that?

03:15.380 --> 03:16.820
It's moussaka.

03:17.300 --> 03:18.700
Moose ka-ka?

03:20.900 --> 03:23.300
And while the pretty girls
got to go to Brownies...

03:23.380 --> 03:25.420
I had to go to Greek school.

03:34.580 --> 03:37.300
At Greek school,
I learned valuable lessons like:

03:37.380 --> 03:41.260
"If Nick has one goat and Maria has nine,
how soon will they marry?"

03:45.220 --> 03:49.180
My mom was always cooking foods
filled with warmth and wisdom...

03:49.260 --> 03:52.460
and never forgetting that side dish
of steaming-hot guilt.

03:52.540 --> 03:55.380
Niko, don't play with the food.

03:55.580 --> 03:58.260
When I was your age, we didn't have food.

03:58.380 --> 03:59.740
- Ma?
- What?

04:00.180 --> 04:02.620
Why do I have to go to Greek school?

04:02.740 --> 04:07.140
When you get married, don't you want to be
able to write your mother-in-law a letter?

04:07.260 --> 04:08.460
Niko, come on, eat!

04:09.620 --> 04:14.140
We lived in a normal, middle-class Chicago
neighborhood of tasteful, modest homes.

04:14.220 --> 04:17.459
Our house, however,
was modeled after the Parthenon...

04:17.579 --> 04:21.620
complete with Corinthian columns,
and guarded by statues of the gods.

04:22.060 --> 04:25.380
In case the neighbors had
any doubts about our heritage...

04:25.460 --> 04:28.900
they could just check out
our subtle tribute to the Greek flag.

04:29.380 --> 04:31.780
My dad believed in only two things...

04:31.860 --> 04:35.100
that Greeks should educate non-Greeks
about being Greek...

04:35.220 --> 04:39.900
and that any ailment, from psoriasis
to poison ivy, could be cured with Windex.

04:42.180 --> 04:46.260
Six years later, I was 12.
Athena, my older, perfect sister, was 15.

04:46.340 --> 04:48.420
And my brother, Nick, was 11.

04:48.500 --> 04:52.420
Every morning, my dad would lecture us
on the "history of our people...

04:52.500 --> 04:55.300
"the great civilization, the Greeks. "

04:55.860 --> 04:59.340
Now, name three things the Greeks did first.

05:00.980 --> 05:03.460
Astronomy, philosophy, and democracy.

05:03.780 --> 05:05.340
Bravo! Very good.

05:06.860 --> 05:08.580
Now, give me a word...

05:09.060 --> 05:10.220
any word...

05:10.380 --> 05:13.900
and I show you, how the root of that word...

05:14.060 --> 05:14.980
is Greek.

05:15.060 --> 05:16.660
Sweet Lord, again.

05:17.580 --> 05:20.460
How about "arachnophobia"?

05:21.180 --> 05:24.900
"Arachna," that comes from
the Greek word for spider...

05:25.500 --> 05:28.580
and "phobia" is a phobia, it means "fear."

05:28.740 --> 05:31.820
So, "fear of spiders." There you go.

05:32.780 --> 05:35.940
Okay, Mr. Portokalos,
how about the word "kimono"?

05:36.860 --> 05:38.500
- "Kimono."
- Good one.

05:39.500 --> 05:41.300
Kimono, kimono.

05:42.580 --> 05:46.220
Of course, "kimono"
comes from the Greek word...

05:46.620 --> 05:49.540
"cheimonas," which means "winter."

05:49.980 --> 05:53.180
So, what do you wear in the wintertime...

05:53.260 --> 05:55.460
to stay warm? A robe.

05:55.820 --> 05:58.900
You see, "robe," "kimono." There you go.

06:05.580 --> 06:08.220
- Bye-bye.
- Goodbye, Mr. Portokalos.

06:13.100 --> 06:14.060
Toula!

06:16.940 --> 06:18.820
You should be proud to be Greek.

06:23.700 --> 06:25.220
A couple more years went by...

06:25.300 --> 06:28.260
and my dad brought his mother
from Greece to live with us...

06:28.340 --> 06:30.580
because we weren't weird enough.

06:45.940 --> 06:47.420
- Where is she going?
- Mama, please!

06:47.500 --> 06:49.620
The Greeks and the Turks friends now.

06:49.700 --> 06:51.500
We told my grandma the war was over...

06:51.580 --> 06:54.100
but she still slept
with a knife under her pillow.

06:56.940 --> 06:58.500
Stop hitting me!

06:59.820 --> 07:02.980
Niko, be careful.
She has a very mean punch.

07:15.260 --> 07:19.500
Nice Greek girls who don't find a husband
work in the family restaurant.

07:19.580 --> 07:22.940
So, here I am, day after day, year after year.

07:23.220 --> 07:25.860
Thirty, and way past my expiration date.

07:26.100 --> 07:28.140
My God. It's freezing.

07:29.580 --> 07:33.780
Fotoula! You closed last night,
you're opening this morning?

07:34.020 --> 07:35.220
I have no life.

07:36.820 --> 07:39.140
Fotoula, you talk to me sometime.

07:39.340 --> 07:41.780
Ma, you're gonna make me
swallow my tongue.

07:43.100 --> 07:45.540
Toula! Is Nikki here?

07:47.340 --> 07:48.300
What's up?

07:48.380 --> 07:51.420
No, my Nikki. She was supposed
to come over to curl my hairs.

07:51.500 --> 07:54.540
Nick, did you check the meat
before you signed for it?

07:54.700 --> 07:56.900
- Dad checked it.
- It better be fresh.

07:57.100 --> 08:00.700
My brother has two jobs,
to cook and to marry a Greek virgin.

08:00.780 --> 08:03.900
Voula, have something to eat
before you go to work.

08:04.740 --> 08:08.660
If nagging was an Olympic sport,
my Aunt Voula would have a gold medal.

08:08.740 --> 08:11.100
Taki, you couldn't wait for me?

08:12.180 --> 08:13.220
Sorry.

08:13.420 --> 08:15.620
Sorry, sorry. Don't "sorry" me.

08:16.940 --> 08:20.220
Look at this. Rash.
Somebody gave me the mati.

08:20.300 --> 08:22.900
- Put some Windex on it.
- Oh, Gus, please.

08:23.660 --> 08:25.700
Voula! This works.

08:26.140 --> 08:29.220
Last night, my toe was as big as my face.

08:31.660 --> 08:33.700
Why you not wait for me?

08:34.700 --> 08:37.299
Gus. He wants to talk.

08:40.780 --> 08:43.179
Anyway, I tell her...

08:43.659 --> 08:47.940
- I will send her to Greece to find somebody.
- She's not too old.

08:54.140 --> 08:55.500
She's okay.

08:55.700 --> 08:56.940
In Greece...

08:57.260 --> 08:59.020
don't tell anyone how old she is.

08:59.380 --> 09:01.940
- She won't go.
- She won't go?

09:02.260 --> 09:05.340
It's like she don't want to get married.

09:07.820 --> 09:09.740
Come on, boys. Go in there.

09:09.980 --> 09:13.460
My sister married young and became
a Greek baby-breeding machine.

09:17.420 --> 09:19.260
Hey, guys. Come on, get out.

09:19.340 --> 09:20.460
Just a quick coffee.

09:20.540 --> 09:23.900
I have to drop the boys off at hockey
and then I got to get to the Jewel.

09:23.980 --> 09:26.340
- Bread?
- Pantyhose are on for 99 cents.

09:26.380 --> 09:30.020
Then the priest is coming to bless
the new house, so I have to make diples.

09:30.060 --> 09:33.060
Can you believe it? I'm out of honey.
Put that back for me.

09:33.140 --> 09:34.620
You dropped my tzatziki.

09:34.700 --> 09:36.060
- Angelo!
- Nikki, shut up.

09:36.140 --> 09:38.660
My cousins have two volumes,
loud and louder.

09:38.700 --> 09:40.660
...your big-ass girlfriend. Thanks, Toula.

09:40.740 --> 09:41.580
Hey, Toula.

09:41.660 --> 09:42.820
We're not that late.

09:43.460 --> 09:44.540
Hi, everybody.

09:46.100 --> 09:49.100
Nikki, how come you didn't come
to curl my hair this morning?

09:49.180 --> 09:51.300
Ma, I had to drop Dimo at work.

09:51.660 --> 09:55.140
Now I got to go open the travel agency,
because some jack-off...

09:55.220 --> 09:57.140
and his big-ass girlfriend are too busy.

09:57.220 --> 10:01.420
Tell her I open up the cleaners every day.
It's time she does something for a change.

10:01.460 --> 10:03.180
You know who's there this morning?

10:03.260 --> 10:05.620
- You're always at the beauty parlor.
- My husband.

10:05.700 --> 10:08.420
- Your nails, hair, everything.
- Don't talk about my hair.

10:08.460 --> 10:11.140
You're lazy.
You and your big-ass girlfriend do nothing.

10:11.220 --> 10:13.700
Did somebody sit on your hair?
It looks a little flat.

10:13.780 --> 10:15.660
Angelo, bite me.

10:15.780 --> 10:17.540
Disgusting, be a lady.

10:17.980 --> 10:18.980
Ma.

10:19.540 --> 10:20.780
Angelo.

10:21.300 --> 10:23.580
Ande. Come on, boys. Let's go.

10:24.300 --> 10:27.020
- Athena, when did you come?
- Hi, Ma. Bye, Ma.

10:27.100 --> 10:28.140
You're going?

10:28.220 --> 10:30.660
I'm going to the Jewel.
I'll get you some pantyhose.

10:30.780 --> 10:33.500
No queen size. They make me look fat.

10:33.740 --> 10:35.660
No more fun and games.

10:35.980 --> 10:37.460
I didn't do it!

10:39.020 --> 10:40.420
Who put the menus there?

10:44.540 --> 10:45.860
Toula, what's this?

10:47.340 --> 10:49.020
Toula, what is this?

10:49.460 --> 10:51.220
- I don't know.
- Mama.

10:53.780 --> 10:55.620
Now don't forget, I need the plates and...

10:55.660 --> 10:58.860
And the pizza for the buffet.
You told me at dinner. Go. My God.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.340
All right, we're gonna go.

11:03.300 --> 11:05.740
- I wanna drive.
- You're driving me crazy, let's go.

11:07.180 --> 11:09.020
Just watch. Don't run.

11:16.100 --> 11:19.380
- To me, she looks okay.
- Okay? What okay? Nokay.

11:19.460 --> 11:23.220
She's not okay. Look.
Athena is married with three children.

11:23.300 --> 11:25.780
And I'll get married, Pops, I promise.

11:28.060 --> 11:30.740
You have plenty of time, Niko.

11:31.420 --> 11:35.020
And you'll always have Toula
to run the restaurant.

11:35.700 --> 11:38.420
It's true. Toula will never leave you.

12:25.780 --> 12:27.700
I wish I had a different life.

12:28.420 --> 12:30.980
I wish I was braver and prettier...

12:31.420 --> 12:32.900
or just happy.

12:33.700 --> 12:37.700
But it's useless to dream,
because nothing ever changes.

12:54.300 --> 12:56.980
- Hey, what's going on?
- Hi. How are you?

12:57.380 --> 12:59.140
- Good. You?
- Oh, good.

13:00.700 --> 13:03.140
- Cool place.
- Yeah, it's adorable.

13:04.940 --> 13:07.740
You missed a hell of a party the other night.

13:09.020 --> 13:10.180
Look at that.

13:10.700 --> 13:12.860
That could have been you
with that arm around her.

13:13.700 --> 13:15.580
You set me up with her already.

13:17.860 --> 13:19.740
- Nancy?
- Hanson's picnic.

13:21.580 --> 13:24.340
No, that was Pamela. This is Nancy.

13:27.940 --> 13:29.580
They look the same.

13:31.820 --> 13:33.140
Well, maybe.

13:33.540 --> 13:35.140
So, you want me to set you up?

13:35.980 --> 13:37.780
They're all the same, Mike.

13:49.700 --> 13:51.020
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:53.540 --> 13:56.700
Sorry, my brain stopped.

13:56.980 --> 14:01.060
You ever have one of those days,
when it's going along and then stops?

14:01.340 --> 14:04.820
Here I am, standing here,
your own private Greek statue.

14:09.740 --> 14:12.580
- Could I get some more coffee, please?
- Sure.

14:14.340 --> 14:15.620
Thank you.

14:25.900 --> 14:27.620
All right, let's go.

14:27.820 --> 14:30.380
- What do you mean? I just got here.
- I got a class.

14:30.460 --> 14:32.780
I love the spice on these potatoes.
What is that?

14:32.820 --> 14:34.580
Like I care. Come on.

14:34.660 --> 14:37.980
Giving a pop quiz,
and I can't wait to hear the groans.

14:39.260 --> 14:40.380
Man, you're tough.

14:40.460 --> 14:43.140
I'm giving a test on Hamlet,
but I give fair warning.

14:53.980 --> 14:54.980
Hi.

14:56.580 --> 14:57.860
Keep the change.

15:11.820 --> 15:14.180
You like this, Pops? For the new menu?

15:14.940 --> 15:18.140
- Where did you get that?
- I drew it, Dad.

15:39.740 --> 15:42.220
Dad, I've been going through
our inventory...

15:42.300 --> 15:46.060
and I've noticed that we've been doing
a lot of unnecessary ordering.

15:46.180 --> 15:49.460
I've been thinking that
maybe we should update our system.

15:49.820 --> 15:51.940
We could get a computer.

15:53.060 --> 15:56.300
I don't know if you remember,
but I got all A's in Computers.

15:56.380 --> 15:59.300
But there's a lot of new stuff to learn now...

15:59.740 --> 16:03.620
so, if you want, I could go to college
and take a few courses.

16:07.540 --> 16:08.580
Why?

16:10.220 --> 16:12.740
Why you want to leave me?

16:12.820 --> 16:14.460
I'm not leaving you.

16:14.540 --> 16:16.580
Don't you want me
to do something with my life?

16:16.620 --> 16:19.980
Yes! Get married! Make babies!

16:20.940 --> 16:22.780
You look so old!

16:39.740 --> 16:42.500
Hey, Toula. Come on.

16:43.620 --> 16:45.340
I know what you want.

16:46.220 --> 16:49.060
You have, how you say, a spirit.

16:50.340 --> 16:53.340
You want to see things. You want to learn.

16:54.380 --> 16:56.420
I know, you're from my side.

16:58.660 --> 17:01.860
Come on. Don't you worry.
I'm gonna talk to him.

17:02.860 --> 17:05.540
Dad is so stubborn. What he says goes.

17:05.579 --> 17:07.420
"The man is the head of the house."

17:07.700 --> 17:09.819
Let me tell you something, Toula.

17:09.900 --> 17:13.700
The man is the head,
but the woman is the neck.

17:13.900 --> 17:17.339
And she can turn the head
any way she wants.

17:20.140 --> 17:21.619
My baby.

17:22.180 --> 17:24.420
Don't cry. Come on.

17:25.180 --> 17:28.300
And what is wrong with Toula
going to school downtown?

17:28.380 --> 17:30.020
They use drugs downtown.

17:30.060 --> 17:33.740
What are you saying? Are you saying
that Toula will get involved with drugs?

17:33.860 --> 17:36.620
No, but somebody will say to her:

17:37.060 --> 17:40.580
"Take this bag down to the bus depot,"
and she'll do it.

17:40.980 --> 17:43.260
She's not stupid. She's smart.

17:43.740 --> 17:47.020
I know she's smart,
so what for she needs more school?

17:47.100 --> 17:49.220
She's smart enough for a girl.

17:50.180 --> 17:52.420
You think you're smarter than me?

17:52.500 --> 17:55.100
No, I mean, you know...

17:55.180 --> 17:56.980
What? What do you mean?

17:57.100 --> 18:00.540
I run the restaurant, I cook, I clean...

18:00.780 --> 18:03.820
I wash for you, and I raised three kids...

18:04.220 --> 18:06.340
and I teach Sunday school.

18:06.780 --> 18:10.660
You know, it's lucky for me
I have you to tie my shoes.

18:12.740 --> 18:14.300
Maria...

19:29.300 --> 19:31.820
- Is this seat taken?
- Sure.

19:36.140 --> 19:37.260
Hi.

20:11.940 --> 20:14.260
That's what I want to talk to you about.

20:17.740 --> 20:20.100
- Look at you. What are you talking about?
- What?

20:20.380 --> 20:22.500
I don't like my butt. Taki likes it.

20:23.500 --> 20:27.100
I won't pretend the travel industry
is something I've always wanted to do.

20:27.180 --> 20:30.820
I'm not gonna pretend that,
but I'm saying that it's different.

20:30.900 --> 20:32.900
You know I've been learning
about computers?

20:33.020 --> 20:34.860
There's this course, a seminar.

20:34.940 --> 20:36.900
It's all about computers and tourism.

20:36.980 --> 20:39.260
There are all the latest applications
and programs.

20:39.340 --> 20:42.900
I could apply it here, Thia.
And your business would double or triple.

20:42.980 --> 20:45.660
You could be with Thio more,
and you could take a vacation.

20:45.740 --> 20:48.140
I could book it for you.
But, Thia, would you hire me?

20:51.020 --> 20:52.300
Of course.

20:53.060 --> 20:54.340
My God!

21:02.820 --> 21:06.860
We must let Kosta think this was his idea,
that he came up with it.

21:06.940 --> 21:08.900
- Ma, he'll figure it out.
- Don't worry.

21:08.940 --> 21:11.660
- I know what to do.
- You don't know what to do, you talk.

21:11.740 --> 21:15.140
Do you want my help? Tell me what to say,
but don't tell me what to say.

21:15.220 --> 21:17.060
- Perfect.
- That's good.

21:21.300 --> 21:23.780
So, Voula. How is business?

21:25.220 --> 21:27.660
Woe to me. Business is bad.

21:29.100 --> 21:32.420
What's the matter? What happened?
Do you need money?

21:33.260 --> 21:37.020
No, what she means is that,
with the two businesses, she suffers.

21:38.180 --> 21:42.700
She suffers. She has to be
at the travel agency alone, all day...

21:43.180 --> 21:47.340
because everybody else needs to be
working at the big dry-cleaning store.

21:47.420 --> 21:50.860
That's right.
I make Taki go to the dry-cleaner store...

21:51.180 --> 21:54.260
and now I have no time with him.

21:56.100 --> 21:58.100
So, send Angelo or Nikki...

21:58.300 --> 22:01.780
to the travel agency,
you be with Taki at the dry cleaner.

22:04.820 --> 22:07.620
- That would be good.
- That would be no good.

22:09.340 --> 22:10.780
Because...

22:11.020 --> 22:14.660
neither Angelo nor Nikki
know how to use the computer.

22:14.740 --> 22:16.260
That's why that no work.

22:18.540 --> 22:19.780
Computer?

22:23.860 --> 22:25.540
I have your answer.

22:27.260 --> 22:30.180
Toula will go to the travel agency...

22:30.260 --> 22:32.860
and you send Nikki here to work for us.

22:34.980 --> 22:37.300
I can't believe this.

22:37.380 --> 22:38.300
Wonderful.

22:40.100 --> 22:41.700
You see, a man...

22:42.540 --> 22:46.020
You're just so smart, I love you.

22:46.860 --> 22:47.500
Bravo!

22:47.500 --> 22:48.300
Bravo!

22:51.020 --> 22:53.380
Hello, Mrs. Christakis. Thanks for holding.

22:53.420 --> 22:56.540
Okay, your request pulled up "confirmed,"
so it is now PNR'd.

22:56.780 --> 23:01.340
Hold again, please. Hi, British Airways.
I'm gonna need a hard tick on that one.

23:02.060 --> 23:05.860
Reading, Alpha, Bravo, Foxtrot, Charlie.
Roger, copy that.

23:05.900 --> 23:08.820
Hi, Mrs. Christakis,
your tickets are now in the mail...

23:08.900 --> 23:11.660
under "Doreen Christakis."
Okay, thank you, bye-bye.

24:00.500 --> 24:02.180
Come on down!

24:02.260 --> 24:04.380
You're the next contestant
on The Price is Right!

24:07.620 --> 24:08.820
I got it.

24:15.700 --> 24:17.300
Did you lose this?

24:21.060 --> 24:25.100
Oh, Mrs. White. You find my mama again.

24:26.180 --> 24:30.180
You know, she come from Greece,
the country I come from, too.

24:30.220 --> 24:32.060
For God's sake, I know.

24:32.380 --> 24:34.980
Listen, keep your mother off my lawn...

24:35.060 --> 24:37.780
out of my basement and away from my roof.

24:38.380 --> 24:41.740
Mrs. White, come on.
Give me a word, any word...

24:42.140 --> 24:45.220
and I'll show you
that the root of that word...

24:47.300 --> 24:48.500
is Greek.

24:49.580 --> 24:52.620
Look, everybody. Look who's back again.

24:54.900 --> 24:57.780
Sit down, Yiayia. Very good.

24:58.500 --> 25:01.180
Toula, there are two kinds of people...

25:01.380 --> 25:04.540
Greeks, and everybody else
who wish they were Greek.

25:04.740 --> 25:07.020
Okay. Yes, we know.

25:09.140 --> 25:10.940
What's the matter with her?

25:47.300 --> 25:49.860
Hi, Mount Olympus Travel Agency.
May I help you?

25:50.220 --> 25:52.260
Sure. That's what we do.

25:54.620 --> 25:56.460
What are you doing? Wait!

25:56.580 --> 25:58.340
Absolutely. Right.

25:58.620 --> 25:59.900
Sorry, lady.

26:05.700 --> 26:06.700
Sure.

26:06.780 --> 26:08.420
You can book it now.

26:08.460 --> 26:11.540
I could reserve the seat for you.
Be with you in a second.

26:11.620 --> 26:15.500
That would be no problem.
Call me back when you're ready. Bye-bye.

26:19.100 --> 26:20.100
Hi.

26:21.820 --> 26:22.780
Hi.

26:28.260 --> 26:30.540
Did you wanna see some brochures?

26:34.140 --> 26:35.220
Found them.

26:41.020 --> 26:42.420
Look at this.

26:44.700 --> 26:48.420
And then, whoosh, you were gone.
I thought you'd fainted.

26:49.700 --> 26:50.780
Okay.

26:51.260 --> 26:52.220
Yeah.

26:52.300 --> 26:56.660
I was swept off of my feet by
your very cool opening line of "hi."

27:02.500 --> 27:03.780
So, Toula?

27:05.540 --> 27:06.540
lan.

27:07.340 --> 27:08.660
lan Miller.

27:10.340 --> 27:12.260
Toula Porkipakos?

27:13.540 --> 27:14.820
Portokalos.

27:16.180 --> 27:18.300
- Okay, Toula.
- All right, then.

27:24.380 --> 27:27.180
Was that a biker fight or a nose job?

27:30.140 --> 27:31.100
Yeah.

27:31.980 --> 27:33.220
No, really.

27:33.580 --> 27:34.940
You don't wanna know.

27:35.940 --> 27:40.420
I don't know about that. If I'd survived
an old-lady ass-kicking, I'd brag about it.

27:44.380 --> 27:46.580
Hey, Jesus! Ouch!

27:48.300 --> 27:50.820
- You want to have dinner with me?
- Yeah.

27:54.900 --> 27:57.940
Actually, I wasn't in education first,
I was prelaw.

27:58.100 --> 28:01.580
My dad's a lawyer and
my grandfather is a lawyer and...

28:03.140 --> 28:06.340
it just wasn't for me,
so I picked a new major.

28:06.980 --> 28:09.100
The parents weren't too pleased, you know?

28:09.180 --> 28:10.260
Yeah.

28:12.060 --> 28:13.500
I think it...

28:15.180 --> 28:17.820
I think it takes
a pretty strong person to do that.

28:19.180 --> 28:21.580
Well, you know everything about me, then...

28:21.620 --> 28:24.100
I'm a pretty strong, vegetarian teacher...

28:24.820 --> 28:26.540
over at Lincoln Park.

28:27.860 --> 28:31.100
I don't know anything about you,
except you're Greek.

28:32.780 --> 28:33.740
Hey...

28:34.900 --> 28:37.180
would you like to go have Greek food?

28:37.780 --> 28:38.940
No, that's okay.

28:39.140 --> 28:43.500
No, listen. I know this really great place,
you probably know it, Zorba's something.

28:44.620 --> 28:47.420
Anyway, I'd like to take you there,
if you'd like to go.

28:48.340 --> 28:51.180
- I don't wanna go there.
- What do you mean? Why not?

28:56.580 --> 28:57.660
That place...

28:58.540 --> 29:00.020
Dancing Zorba's.

29:00.140 --> 29:01.380
Dancing Zorba's.

29:02.580 --> 29:04.660
My family owns that restaurant.

29:07.740 --> 29:08.700
Really?

29:16.820 --> 29:18.180
I remember you.

29:21.220 --> 29:22.500
You're that waitress.

29:24.740 --> 29:27.460
Seating hostess, actually.

29:28.620 --> 29:29.980
I remember you.

29:30.980 --> 29:32.900
I was kind of going through a phase...

29:33.900 --> 29:36.500
up until now.

29:37.060 --> 29:37.980
And...

29:40.260 --> 29:41.700
I was Frump Girl.

29:42.460 --> 29:45.060
I don't remember Frump Girl,
but I remember you.

29:48.740 --> 29:51.940
Okay, no Greek. Italian? Tomorrow night?

29:54.220 --> 29:55.300
Okay.

29:58.420 --> 29:59.620
Where are you going?

30:01.980 --> 30:03.620
I'm taking a pottery class.

30:05.020 --> 30:06.700
The Greeks invented pottery.

30:29.540 --> 30:31.180
So, it was just me, all alone...

30:31.260 --> 30:34.620
up in the mountains in this cottage,
with my parents, all summer.

30:35.020 --> 30:37.380
Well, don't all your cousins go up, too?

30:39.020 --> 30:39.940
No!

30:40.820 --> 30:43.380
I only have two cousins.
They live in Wisconsin.

30:44.340 --> 30:46.340
- You only have two cousins?
- Yeah.

30:47.260 --> 30:49.380
- How many do you have?
- More than two.

30:50.860 --> 30:52.020
Well, who else?

30:52.380 --> 30:55.860
Didn't you have brothers and sisters?
What are your parents like?

30:58.700 --> 30:59.620
What?

31:00.940 --> 31:02.020
Well...

31:04.260 --> 31:06.780
Okay, Christmas.

31:06.860 --> 31:09.140
What do you do for Christmas
with your family?

31:09.860 --> 31:11.260
My mom makes roast lamb.

31:12.780 --> 31:14.780
- With mint jelly?
- No.

31:17.860 --> 31:19.140
And?

31:20.620 --> 31:21.860
And...

31:27.940 --> 31:29.780
- I'm Greek, right?
- Right.

31:29.860 --> 31:32.220
So what happens is my dad and my uncles...

31:32.300 --> 31:34.580
fight over who gets to eat the lamb brain.

31:34.660 --> 31:37.860
And them my Aunt Voula forks the eyeball,
and chases me around...

31:37.900 --> 31:40.420
trying to make me eat it,
because it'll make me smart.

31:40.500 --> 31:43.140
You have two cousins.
I have 27 first cousins.

31:43.220 --> 31:45.140
Just 27 first cousins, alone.

31:45.220 --> 31:47.860
And my whole family is big and loud...

31:47.940 --> 31:50.660
and everybody's always
in each other's lives and business.

31:50.740 --> 31:55.100
You never have a minute alone to just think,
because we're always together eating.

31:55.380 --> 31:57.540
The only other people we know are Greeks...

31:57.620 --> 32:00.060
because Greeks marry Greeks,
to breed more Greeks...

32:00.140 --> 32:01.980
to be loud, breeding, Greek eaters.

32:03.820 --> 32:05.860
- Wow.
- I'm serious.

32:05.900 --> 32:09.820
No one in my family has ever
gone out with a non-Greek before. No one.

32:12.260 --> 32:13.180
And you're...

32:15.540 --> 32:16.500
You're...

32:16.900 --> 32:19.580
God, you're just, you know, wonderful.

32:22.820 --> 32:25.300
But I just don't see
how this is going to work out.

32:26.660 --> 32:27.580
So...

32:28.220 --> 32:30.820
Work out? What's to work out?

32:31.300 --> 32:32.900
We're not a different species.

32:33.740 --> 32:36.140
Yes, we come from different backgrounds...

32:36.460 --> 32:40.100
and, hey, here's some news
about my life, to this point.

32:40.380 --> 32:41.540
It's boring.

32:42.380 --> 32:43.740
Then I met you...

32:44.540 --> 32:47.420
and you're interesting,
and you're beautiful and fun.

32:48.500 --> 32:50.460
You've got a weird family. Who doesn't?

32:56.980 --> 32:58.980
I just want to spend some time with you.

33:01.740 --> 33:03.820
I just want to spend a little time with you.

33:06.820 --> 33:08.340
Did you say I'm beautiful?

33:38.900 --> 33:39.860
Yes.

33:54.540 --> 33:55.740
Which house is yours?

33:55.820 --> 33:57.660
This is good, actually.

33:57.740 --> 33:58.900
- Can you stop?
- Sure.

33:58.980 --> 34:01.060
Right here is good. Just stop.

34:01.660 --> 34:02.900
Thanks.

34:22.060 --> 34:23.300
Good night.

34:55.580 --> 34:56.780
Good night.

35:12.900 --> 35:14.500
- Okay, good night.
- What?

35:15.380 --> 35:16.820
No, don't go.

35:27.260 --> 35:28.340
Good night.

35:29.100 --> 35:30.020
Don't go.

35:57.580 --> 36:00.100
And I can make a man out of you

36:00.180 --> 36:02.620
'Cause I'm a woman

36:03.020 --> 36:06.060
W-O-M-A-N

36:07.260 --> 36:09.660
Happy again today, Toula?

36:10.540 --> 36:11.500
Yeah.

36:11.740 --> 36:14.540
Now every time I see you,
you have a great big smile.

36:15.660 --> 36:17.420
- Hi, Ma.
- Hey, Niko.

36:17.500 --> 36:18.900
- Where'd you go?
- Nowhere.

36:18.980 --> 36:20.540
- What did you do?
- Nothing.

36:20.620 --> 36:22.100
- Who did you see?
- No one.

36:22.220 --> 36:25.060
Wait a minute, Niko,
I put them in your room.

36:25.180 --> 36:28.900
Toula, how was your class?

36:30.100 --> 36:31.540
My pottery class?

36:32.460 --> 36:34.860
- It's great.
- Good.

36:52.900 --> 36:55.940
- You've got to get out of here.
- Just one more kiss, then I'll go.

36:56.740 --> 36:57.660
No.

37:03.540 --> 37:05.620
What is going on?

37:07.220 --> 37:09.860
Mr. Pottery Class, nice to meet you.

37:12.620 --> 37:14.460
lan, this is my cousin, Nikki.

37:15.260 --> 37:16.940
Hello!

37:17.500 --> 37:20.100
It's nice to finally meet
a member of Toula's family.

37:20.180 --> 37:21.660
Yeah, well...

37:26.860 --> 37:30.020
I'm the least of your worries.
Listen, the family knows.

37:30.540 --> 37:33.460
Last night, Vicki Pavalopolis
saw you sucking the lips...

37:33.540 --> 37:35.500
off his head, in the Denny's parking lot.

37:35.580 --> 37:39.300
She told her ma, who told my ma,
who told your ma...

37:39.500 --> 37:41.500
Let me put it this way. You're busted.

37:41.580 --> 37:43.540
You sneak around, all over Chicago...

37:43.620 --> 37:47.340
but you never come here to ask me,
can you date my daughter.

37:49.140 --> 37:51.860
I'm sorry, but to ask you
if I can date your daughter...

37:51.940 --> 37:53.500
Sir, she's 30 years old.

37:53.580 --> 37:55.820
I am the head of this house!

37:56.740 --> 38:00.740
Okay, may I please date your daughter?

38:02.740 --> 38:03.860
No!

38:09.740 --> 38:12.020
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.

38:14.700 --> 38:15.620
Excuse me.

38:22.340 --> 38:25.260
Didn't I say it's a mistake...

38:25.900 --> 38:27.540
to educate women?

38:28.300 --> 38:31.540
But nobody listened to me.

38:31.980 --> 38:35.740
Now we have a boyfriend in the house.

38:35.820 --> 38:38.580
Is he a nice Greek boy?

38:39.460 --> 38:40.980
No, no Greek.

38:41.260 --> 38:43.340
No Greek! A xeno!

38:43.460 --> 38:46.620
A xeno with a big long hairs...

38:46.700 --> 38:49.380
- On top of his head!
- Kosta.

38:56.620 --> 38:58.220
I'm sorry I lied to you.

39:09.180 --> 39:10.500
Okay, Toula...

39:11.180 --> 39:13.660
maybe you are having a little romance.

39:17.140 --> 39:18.500
But end it now.

39:22.220 --> 39:23.300
I love him.

39:24.780 --> 39:26.580
Toula, eat something...

39:27.500 --> 39:28.700
please.

39:39.260 --> 39:41.420
Your father has a friend for dinner.

40:20.820 --> 40:22.300
What's this? Where are we?

40:24.060 --> 40:25.180
My apartment.

40:26.540 --> 40:28.060
You wanna go up?

41:06.060 --> 41:07.020
This is it.

42:06.820 --> 42:09.220
Don't worry, they're gonna love you.

42:14.660 --> 42:18.100
"Toula." Now that's not a name
you hear every day.

42:18.180 --> 42:20.780
Does it mean anything in your language?

42:20.900 --> 42:24.660
Well, my Greek name, Fotoula,
means "Light of God."

42:27.340 --> 42:29.220
Who would like a coffee?

42:31.420 --> 42:33.780
So, you're Greek then?

42:33.900 --> 42:35.980
What's your last name?

42:36.300 --> 42:37.380
Portokalos.

42:38.060 --> 42:39.540
In Greek, it means "orange."

42:40.020 --> 42:44.500
Like an orange that you eat,
the one with the peel, not the color.

42:46.780 --> 42:49.220
Yeah, it's really Greek.

42:50.340 --> 42:53.540
Rodney, didn't you once have
a Greek receptionist?

42:54.500 --> 42:57.140
No, Harriet, she was...

42:59.300 --> 43:02.100
- Just a minute.
- No, she was Armenian.

43:02.700 --> 43:05.740
- Is Armenia close to Greece?
- Not exactly.

43:06.220 --> 43:07.540
- What was she?
- Who?

43:07.820 --> 43:09.540
My secretary, for heaven's sake.

43:10.100 --> 43:11.540
Everyone like cheesecake?

43:12.820 --> 43:16.580
- Guatemalan.
- That's right, dear. She was Guatemalan.

43:46.140 --> 43:47.180
I love you.

43:49.420 --> 43:50.780
I love you.

43:58.740 --> 44:00.100
I don't...

44:01.900 --> 44:03.700
I don't really know how to say this.

44:04.900 --> 44:05.900
What?

44:10.060 --> 44:11.300
Will you marry me?

44:13.740 --> 44:14.860
Yes!

44:20.620 --> 44:22.860
I guess, now you can have this.

44:26.700 --> 44:28.140
Come here.

45:06.780 --> 45:07.740
Enough.

45:12.580 --> 45:16.060
What? Don't you walk away from me.
Sit down.

45:22.700 --> 45:23.660
Kosta...

45:24.780 --> 45:27.740
they love each other. It's done.

45:28.980 --> 45:29.940
How?

45:30.580 --> 45:33.980
How can she do this to me?

45:34.820 --> 45:37.620
She didn't do this to you or to me.

45:38.540 --> 45:41.180
They fell in love. It happens.

45:42.300 --> 45:44.780
Is he a good boy? I don't know.

45:45.260 --> 45:49.340
Is he from a good family? I don't know.

45:50.580 --> 45:53.500
Is he respectful? I don't know...

45:54.340 --> 45:57.500
because nobody talks to me
about nothing no more.

45:57.900 --> 46:01.660
A respectful boy would come here
and ask for my permission.

46:02.740 --> 46:05.700
My daughter engaged to a xeno.

46:06.220 --> 46:10.340
I always think she's going to be married
in the Greek Orthodox Church.

46:11.140 --> 46:13.220
Why is she doing this to me?

46:19.460 --> 46:22.660
...and leave space.
Sometimes their space is so big...

46:22.700 --> 46:25.380
that the roof can't support itself,
so it collapses.

46:31.340 --> 46:32.260
Excuse me.

46:33.660 --> 46:35.260
Try not to be too loud.

46:41.060 --> 46:41.980
Hi.

46:44.020 --> 46:45.140
- Hi.
- Hi.

46:46.700 --> 46:48.380
What's going on?

46:50.460 --> 46:52.180
- Are you okay?
- Can we go to Vegas?

46:52.260 --> 46:53.180
What?

46:53.260 --> 46:56.420
Can we go to Niagara Falls or Fiji...
You want to go to Fiji?

46:56.660 --> 46:57.620
Sure.

46:57.900 --> 46:59.860
Okay, let's go. Come on.

47:01.660 --> 47:02.620
Come here.

47:03.340 --> 47:04.460
What's the matter?

47:07.060 --> 47:10.660
I just feel like we can't get married,
not like this.

47:12.100 --> 47:13.020
It's like...

47:13.580 --> 47:15.420
when I'm with you...

47:15.540 --> 47:17.620
I am so happy...

47:18.540 --> 47:20.860
but my family is so unhappy.

47:21.300 --> 47:23.580
And our wedding should be
this joyous thing.

47:23.660 --> 47:26.420
But it won't be for them,
because it can't be in our church.

47:26.500 --> 47:30.260
So, let's just go somewhere.
Please, let's just go.

47:31.340 --> 47:33.900
Hey, I love you.

47:34.580 --> 47:35.780
Why?

47:36.580 --> 47:38.180
Why do you love me?

47:39.300 --> 47:41.540
Because I came alive when I met you.

47:43.340 --> 47:44.740
But my family...

47:46.820 --> 47:48.620
You're a part of your family...

47:50.060 --> 47:51.900
and I'll do anything...

47:53.260 --> 47:55.620
whatever it takes, to get them to accept me.

47:56.780 --> 47:59.380
Because you're my whole life now.

47:59.940 --> 48:02.940
We're not going to skulk off
and get married...

48:03.620 --> 48:05.300
as if we're ashamed of ourselves.

48:06.780 --> 48:07.740
Okay?

48:09.260 --> 48:10.220
Okay.

48:12.740 --> 48:13.900
Did you say "skulk"?

48:13.980 --> 48:16.980
- Shut up.
- Let's just skulk off somewhere...

48:20.620 --> 48:21.780
Come on, talk to him.

48:22.140 --> 48:23.660
Toula loves him.

48:23.860 --> 48:25.620
Do it for Toula, come on.

48:26.180 --> 48:29.420
Come on.
He wants to get married in the church.

48:29.620 --> 48:31.180
- Go!
- All right.

48:41.380 --> 48:44.420
So, you're going to be baptized tomorrow?

48:51.340 --> 48:52.780
It's your lucky day...

48:52.860 --> 48:56.100
to be baptized
in the Greek Orthodox Church.

48:57.860 --> 49:00.100
Nikki's going to be your godmother.

49:03.980 --> 49:04.900
You know...

49:05.780 --> 49:07.460
the word "baptism"...

49:08.460 --> 49:11.900
comes from the Greek word "baftisia. "

49:12.020 --> 49:13.780
That's where we dip the baby...

49:13.860 --> 49:16.900
in a beautiful, little silver basin.

49:51.500 --> 49:53.180
It's not so bad?

49:53.260 --> 49:56.500
Are you kidding? Any minute now,
he's going to look at me and go:

49:56.580 --> 49:58.740
"Right, you're so not worth this."

50:00.580 --> 50:01.700
Yes, you are.

50:19.900 --> 50:21.140
You're all oily.

50:22.820 --> 50:24.060
I'm Greek, now.

50:25.900 --> 50:27.300
Thank you so much.

50:38.860 --> 50:42.060
So, for "Happy Easter,"
we say "Khristos Anesti."

50:42.140 --> 50:44.420
Then the other person says back,
"Alithos Anesti."

50:44.500 --> 50:48.420
So if you want to say "Happy Easter,"
you go, "Khristos Anesti." So try it.

50:50.860 --> 50:51.820
That's good.

50:56.060 --> 50:57.020
Hey, Dad.

51:01.980 --> 51:04.340
Mr. Portokalos, Khristos Anesti.

51:11.900 --> 51:13.380
- He likes you.
- Yes?

51:13.900 --> 51:15.900
I told you to watch the boys.

51:15.980 --> 51:18.420
They'll be fine with the video games.

51:18.500 --> 51:21.780
- You turn their brains to mush.
- I can't do anything right.

51:22.220 --> 51:25.580
lan, if you're going to be in this family,
I'll get you some earplugs...

51:25.660 --> 51:29.100
because the Portokalos women,
if they're not nagging somebody, they die!

51:29.940 --> 51:33.700
- You're in trouble when I tell my sister.
- Tell me what?

51:37.060 --> 51:38.580
Where is he?

51:39.460 --> 51:41.540
Khristos Anesti.

51:43.540 --> 51:45.580
Alithos Anesti, Thia.

51:45.860 --> 51:47.580
Toula, you're engaged!

51:47.980 --> 51:50.420
We never think it would happen for you.
Never.

51:51.780 --> 51:54.700
- Taki, didn't we say that?
- We never think this day will come.

51:55.180 --> 51:57.740
- And it came!
- Is this him?

51:58.460 --> 52:00.260
Yes, sorry. Everyone, this is lan.

52:00.300 --> 52:02.180
lan!

52:38.020 --> 52:39.220
Hello, lan.

52:57.620 --> 52:59.300
I want to see the rock.

53:03.860 --> 53:05.100
- Hey, lan.
- Hey.

53:05.180 --> 53:07.060
- You like that dance?
- Yeah.

53:07.140 --> 53:09.660
Okay, Jennie has something
she wants to ask you.

53:09.740 --> 53:11.180
- No, she doesn't.
- Go on.

53:11.300 --> 53:12.500
Jennie, just ask me.

53:12.660 --> 53:14.060
Does he have any brothers?

53:14.540 --> 53:16.260
No, he's an only child.

53:16.380 --> 53:19.460
I've got to tell you,
I've never seen my sister so happy.

53:20.940 --> 53:23.980
If you hurt her, I'll kill you
and make it look like an accident.

53:25.380 --> 53:28.500
Jesus, look at your face. It's just a joke.

53:28.860 --> 53:29.820
Good one.

53:29.980 --> 53:32.740
No, the good one is, "I've got a gun."
Yeah, I've got a gun...

53:32.780 --> 53:34.620
and I swear, I'll jam it up your...

53:34.700 --> 53:36.260
lan, I got you again!

53:37.260 --> 53:39.860
- Here, eat some rice.
- I don't want any rice, I'm good.

53:39.980 --> 53:42.340
No, "I'm good."
I could snap you like a chicken!

53:42.700 --> 53:44.700
Come on, lighten up.

53:44.980 --> 53:47.780
I'll lighten you when I take out your kidneys.

53:49.660 --> 53:51.060
One more time, lan.

53:51.340 --> 53:54.500
- Hey, Angelo.
- Hey, lan, we're going to kill you!

54:21.180 --> 54:22.820
lan, Aunt Voula.

54:23.420 --> 54:24.740
Let me touch your hair.

54:29.340 --> 54:31.420
- Okay, Thia Voula?
- No.

54:31.460 --> 54:32.620
- Thia Voula?
- Yes?

54:34.700 --> 54:37.260
When you come to my house
and I cook for you?

54:37.340 --> 54:39.660
- Okay.
- Thia, that might be a problem.

54:39.740 --> 54:42.100
Problem? I'm the best cook
in the family. Tell him.

54:42.180 --> 54:43.940
- I did, didn't I?
- Twice.

54:43.980 --> 54:45.220
Okay, then.

54:46.660 --> 54:47.980
It's just...

54:48.780 --> 54:49.740
Yeah?

54:50.380 --> 54:52.220
lan is a vegetarian.

54:52.740 --> 54:54.020
He doesn't eat meat.

54:55.740 --> 54:57.020
He don't eat no meat?

54:57.420 --> 54:58.820
No, he doesn't eat meat.

54:58.900 --> 55:01.060
What do you mean, "He don't eat no meat"?

55:04.740 --> 55:07.260
That's okay, I'll make lamb.

55:07.460 --> 55:08.500
Come.

55:09.060 --> 55:10.740
Come and dance.

55:42.700 --> 55:43.660
Silence.

55:46.820 --> 55:48.020
It's delicious.

55:50.540 --> 55:54.060
We took a look at my calendar,
our calendar...

55:54.620 --> 55:57.420
to set a day for the big day...

55:57.500 --> 56:00.580
sometime at the end of October,
mid-November?

56:00.660 --> 56:03.260
- Sometime in there, yeah.
- Wonderful.

56:03.340 --> 56:05.700
I'll call the Club and see what's open.

56:06.260 --> 56:07.260
The Club?

56:07.620 --> 56:10.340
The North Shore Country Club,
for the wedding, of course.

56:11.300 --> 56:13.660
We're going to get married
in Toula's church...

56:13.820 --> 56:16.420
because we're not very religious,
and her family is.

56:16.700 --> 56:19.100
Really is. Show them the brochure.

56:19.900 --> 56:21.340
Oh, that. Yeah.

56:24.900 --> 56:28.060
My cousin Nikki made me this.

56:28.140 --> 56:30.820
She tends to save things.
This is from her prom.

56:31.340 --> 56:33.060
She makes lamps and...

56:33.260 --> 56:35.980
Tell them about, we got this great big hall...

56:36.180 --> 56:39.460
- What's it called, for the reception?
- Aphrodite's Palace.

56:39.500 --> 56:41.060
It's not really a palace.

56:43.260 --> 56:44.420
This is a brochure.

56:48.900 --> 56:51.700
That Parthenon backdrop is optional.

56:55.220 --> 56:58.340
Yes, smarty, if we invite Makopouloses...

56:58.380 --> 57:01.380
we have to invite Adamopouloses!
They're cousins!

57:04.500 --> 57:06.980
Dad, the thing is
that we just want to keep it small.

57:07.060 --> 57:10.420
It's like you'd rather go bankrupt
than insult anyone from the church.

57:10.540 --> 57:11.620
Toula...

57:12.100 --> 57:16.300
I come to this country
with $8 in my pocket...

57:16.620 --> 57:18.940
to make all this for you.

57:19.580 --> 57:20.540
And...

57:21.820 --> 57:25.300
who knows how long I'm going to be alive?

57:27.460 --> 57:28.900
Let me see the list.

57:31.140 --> 57:33.700
Okay, come on. Time out!

57:34.260 --> 57:36.260
No more punching Thio Niko's nads, okay?

57:36.340 --> 57:38.300
Foti, stop hitting Thio Niko.

57:38.500 --> 57:40.860
Look at you, how big you are!

57:43.500 --> 57:45.820
Boys, come on, soccer practice. Let's go.

57:45.900 --> 57:48.860
- Did she spit on him?
- Now go on, go outside with your father.

57:48.940 --> 57:51.940
Yeah, for good luck. Keeps the devil away.

57:52.740 --> 57:54.380
Bye. Wait for me.

57:55.820 --> 57:56.820
Dad.

57:59.820 --> 58:01.180
Where did you get that?

58:01.700 --> 58:04.060
I drew it, Dad, for the new menu.
Remember?

58:08.740 --> 58:09.860
Ma, I'm hungry.

58:10.220 --> 58:11.580
Okay, Niko.

58:11.980 --> 58:13.620
lan, are you hungry?

58:13.820 --> 58:16.540
- No, I already ate.
- Okay, I'll make you something.

58:17.540 --> 58:18.620
Okay.

58:19.220 --> 58:22.540
Now, Toula,
we have to have Tommy Kasimatis.

58:24.740 --> 58:26.540
Hey, let me help you with those.

58:26.620 --> 58:29.380
- What is wrong with Tommy Kasimatis?
- I don't know them.

58:29.420 --> 58:32.380
- Who cares? They're related to me.
- Why are you being so weird?

58:32.420 --> 58:35.460
- I'm not being weird.
- You're weird when you're pregnant.

58:41.580 --> 58:43.100
lan, eat.

58:45.900 --> 58:47.900
How do you say "thank you" in Greek?

58:50.980 --> 58:52.780
That's it. You got it.

59:07.500 --> 59:08.660
- Hey, Toula!
- Yeah?

59:08.820 --> 59:11.580
Listen, I got the greatest connection
for your invitations.

59:11.860 --> 59:14.180
No, we're gonna order
our own invitations, okay?

59:14.220 --> 59:16.860
I don't want something
your cash-only connection gets...

59:16.900 --> 59:18.300
that falls off of a truck.

59:18.380 --> 59:21.660
- Yeah, but they come through, right?
- For God's sake, let the man talk.

59:21.700 --> 59:24.100
- Why are you always so stubborn?
- I'm not stubborn...

59:25.420 --> 59:29.060
Girls, I ordered the invitations
two weeks ago.

59:30.260 --> 59:33.180
- I never saw a wedding invitation.
- I'll go get them.

59:40.980 --> 59:42.820
Wait till you see them.

59:54.660 --> 59:56.940
My parents' names are Rodney and Harriet.

59:59.060 --> 01:00:00.180
"Rodney and Harry"?

01:00:04.780 --> 01:00:06.780
I didn't notice, so I bet they won't.

01:00:06.820 --> 01:00:08.580
Yia sas, everybody.

01:00:09.260 --> 01:00:11.860
Wait. I have got the biggest scoop.

01:00:12.820 --> 01:00:17.060
Look at the earrings I have found
that match the bridesmaids' dresses.

01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:20.540
I remembered.
We have a customer at the dry cleaner's...

01:00:20.620 --> 01:00:22.580
who is a custom jewelry designer.

01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:24.540
So, I showed her the fabric.

01:00:24.620 --> 01:00:27.860
Wait, what do these match?
Not that fabric you showed me last week.

01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:30.660
- You said you liked it.
- I said I'd think about it.

01:00:30.940 --> 01:00:32.620
That's just because...

01:00:34.780 --> 01:00:36.900
you couldn't visualize it.

01:00:38.980 --> 01:00:41.980
- You're so beautiful!
- Don't worry, you don't have to do a thing.

01:00:42.060 --> 01:00:43.020
That's classy.

01:00:45.340 --> 01:00:47.540
I went by the college and picked this up.

01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:51.260
Look.

01:00:52.820 --> 01:00:56.740
I'm gonna start slowly, you know.
Do a couple of night courses.

01:00:58.860 --> 01:01:03.420
I just wanted to learn more about painting
and art and stuff, so...

01:01:04.380 --> 01:01:06.300
This is so great.

01:01:07.380 --> 01:01:08.860
Yeah, you started it.

01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:11.060
You wanted to do something else...

01:01:12.220 --> 01:01:13.300
and you did it.

01:01:15.740 --> 01:01:16.700
Hey, Toula...

01:01:17.700 --> 01:01:19.980
don't let your past dictate who you are...

01:01:20.820 --> 01:01:23.660
but let it be part of who you will become.

01:01:25.100 --> 01:01:27.380
Nick, that is so beautiful.

01:01:27.780 --> 01:01:28.900
Yeah.

01:01:29.340 --> 01:01:32.500
That Dear Abby,
she really knows what she's talking about.

01:01:47.620 --> 01:01:49.860
- Hello?
- Hi, Mom, it's me.

01:01:50.940 --> 01:01:53.220
All right, lan is going to pick me up...

01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:57.420
and then we'll get his parents,
and then we're gonna be there in one hour.

01:01:57.540 --> 01:01:58.620
- Good.
- Okay.

01:01:58.700 --> 01:02:01.580
- Is everything okay? What are you doing?
- I peel the potatoes.

01:02:01.660 --> 01:02:04.340
Why are you peeling potatoes?
I peeled some this morning.

01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:05.900
I know, but we need more.

01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:08.060
How much are you cooking?

01:02:08.260 --> 01:02:09.540
It's a lot of people.

01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:12.380
- There's three of them.
- And us.

01:02:12.740 --> 01:02:15.340
- Then that makes seven.
- And the family.

01:02:17.220 --> 01:02:20.780
The family? You invited the whole family?

01:02:21.220 --> 01:02:22.420
Of course.

01:02:23.020 --> 01:02:26.860
Ma, I said, "Come for a quiet dinner,
and meet my parents."

01:02:27.340 --> 01:02:29.820
They might as well meet
the whole family, right?

01:02:30.060 --> 01:02:33.020
- Maria.
- I got to go, Taki's here. Bye.

01:02:35.980 --> 01:02:37.140
I'm coming.

01:02:40.420 --> 01:02:43.220
Look at this. Bravo!

01:02:44.740 --> 01:02:46.420
Okay, hurry, put it on the spit.

01:03:23.140 --> 01:03:24.580
They are here!

01:03:27.460 --> 01:03:29.380
Excuse me.

01:03:31.820 --> 01:03:33.340
Welcome to my home.

01:03:35.660 --> 01:03:38.340
Over here is my brother, Ted...

01:03:38.620 --> 01:03:42.940
and his wife, Melissa, and their children,
Anita, Diane, and Nick.

01:03:43.260 --> 01:03:46.500
Over here, my brother, Tommy,
his wife, Angie...

01:03:46.580 --> 01:03:49.380
and their children, Anita, Diane, and Nick.

01:03:49.580 --> 01:03:52.900
And here, my brother, George,
that's his wife, Frieda...

01:03:53.020 --> 01:03:55.780
and their children, Anita, Diane, and Nick.

01:03:55.940 --> 01:03:59.380
Taki, Sophie, Carrie, Nick, Nick, Nick...

01:04:03.380 --> 01:04:04.580
Nikki...

01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:07.460
and I am Gus.

01:04:14.380 --> 01:04:18.020
They are here? Where? Excuse me.

01:04:20.060 --> 01:04:21.140
Hello.

01:04:23.740 --> 01:04:26.340
I am Maria Portokalos...

01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:28.900
and welcome to our home.

01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:38.700
Thank you. What is it?

01:04:38.980 --> 01:04:39.900
It's a bundt.

01:04:40.540 --> 01:04:42.460
- A "bundt"?
- Bundt.

01:04:56.100 --> 01:04:58.820
It's a cake! I know!

01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:03.540
Thank you. Thank you very much.

01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:08.660
There's a hole in this cake.

01:05:10.700 --> 01:05:12.260
These are some of my cousins.

01:05:12.540 --> 01:05:15.100
Hey, lan, good to see you, man.

01:05:15.140 --> 01:05:19.100
Listen, I really think you should say,
"Eho tria arhidia."

01:05:19.260 --> 01:05:21.020
It means, "Everyone, come in the house."

01:05:21.060 --> 01:05:22.700
Everybody will really like it.

01:05:24.260 --> 01:05:26.460
That's good, you've got it.

01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:28.700
- I'm not falling for that again.
- Why?

01:05:28.900 --> 01:05:30.180
Yeah, why?

01:05:30.740 --> 01:05:34.340
Angelo, how do you say,
"Everyone, let's go in the house"?

01:05:38.260 --> 01:05:39.300
Everyone...

01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:47.900
You're in so much trouble!

01:05:49.060 --> 01:05:52.380
This is from Mykonos, beautiful island.

01:05:52.940 --> 01:05:55.140
See that? That's where we're from.

01:05:55.500 --> 01:05:57.140
You like them? I make them.

01:05:59.580 --> 01:06:02.260
Go, sit down. Sit. Come.

01:06:02.340 --> 01:06:03.260
Go. Go now.

01:06:04.380 --> 01:06:05.780
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

01:06:08.740 --> 01:06:10.220
Now you are family.

01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:13.660
Okay. All my life...

01:06:14.300 --> 01:06:17.860
I had a lump at the back of my neck.
Right here. Always a lump.

01:06:19.300 --> 01:06:22.020
Then I started menopause,
and the lump got bigger.

01:06:22.260 --> 01:06:24.540
From the hormones, it started to grow.

01:06:25.300 --> 01:06:28.460
So, I go to the doctor, and he did the...

01:06:29.260 --> 01:06:30.500
the bios... The...

01:06:30.900 --> 01:06:32.380
The bubopsy.

01:06:33.700 --> 01:06:36.900
Inside the lump, he found teeth...

01:06:37.620 --> 01:06:38.980
and a spinal cord.

01:06:41.540 --> 01:06:43.620
Yes, inside the lump...

01:06:44.340 --> 01:06:45.500
was my twin.

01:06:48.900 --> 01:06:51.140
Spanakopita! You hungry?

01:07:01.180 --> 01:07:03.900
- I love it when you speak in Greek.
- Really?

01:07:04.060 --> 01:07:06.340
It's sexy. Having a good time?

01:07:07.580 --> 01:07:08.940
All right! Come on.

01:07:11.100 --> 01:07:13.140
Rodney, Harry, ouzo?

01:07:17.540 --> 01:07:18.460
Thank you.

01:07:24.260 --> 01:07:25.780
It's licorice.

01:07:26.100 --> 01:07:27.820
It's delicious.

01:07:38.340 --> 01:07:41.060
Another. You're Greeks now. Don't be shy.

01:07:58.380 --> 01:08:00.300
Don't worry, I'll be back.

01:08:09.700 --> 01:08:12.420
The meat is here, everybody.

01:08:13.100 --> 01:08:15.380
Meat. Very good. Very good.

01:08:16.779 --> 01:08:19.979
You like some meat?
Some Greek meat, very good.

01:08:28.180 --> 01:08:30.020
Red meat, everybody.

01:08:30.100 --> 01:08:32.660
- Thank you for food, Gus.
- Real fine.

01:08:33.020 --> 01:08:34.899
Coming through.

01:08:34.979 --> 01:08:35.939
Bravo, Maria.

01:08:39.340 --> 01:08:42.220
And now, the bundt cake.

01:08:42.500 --> 01:08:43.819
You fixed it.

01:08:44.060 --> 01:08:45.540
I tried. You tried.

01:08:46.180 --> 01:08:48.540
We all nice to them, you see it.

01:08:48.740 --> 01:08:51.700
And they look at us like we're from the zoo.

01:08:54.580 --> 01:08:56.300
This no work, Maria.

01:08:56.700 --> 01:08:58.859
They different people.

01:08:59.460 --> 01:09:03.180
So dry. That family is like a piece of toast.

01:09:03.540 --> 01:09:06.859
No honey, no jam, just dry.

01:09:07.740 --> 01:09:09.899
My daughter...

01:09:09.979 --> 01:09:12.180
gonna marry lan Miller.

01:09:12.260 --> 01:09:15.580
A xeno with a toast family.

01:09:16.899 --> 01:09:19.620
I never think this can happen to us.

01:09:20.100 --> 01:09:22.020
I try to put little marmalade...

01:09:22.580 --> 01:09:24.939
Oh, no, they don't like.

01:09:25.420 --> 01:09:28.859
They like themselves, all dry and cracking.

01:09:39.420 --> 01:09:40.859
And in Toula's church...

01:09:40.939 --> 01:09:42.939
the best man is actually
part of the ceremony.

01:09:42.979 --> 01:09:44.939
He's got to be Greek Orthodox, so...

01:09:45.260 --> 01:09:48.340
I can't ask you to be my best man,
although, technically, you are.

01:09:49.500 --> 01:09:51.939
You were gonna ask me
to be your best man?

01:09:52.020 --> 01:09:52.979
Yeah.

01:09:53.700 --> 01:09:54.820
I am touched.

01:09:56.900 --> 01:09:59.300
I had no idea you had so few friends.

01:10:03.220 --> 01:10:07.620
That's okay. Just get me a little badge
that says "best man" or something like that.

01:10:10.180 --> 01:10:14.380
No offence, but this girl's family's
got you by the short ones.

01:10:15.260 --> 01:10:18.140
They say "jump,"
and you pull out the trampoline.

01:10:21.380 --> 01:10:22.380
Yeah.

01:10:22.820 --> 01:10:23.780
Okay.

01:10:24.260 --> 01:10:25.860
My life is shit.

01:10:27.380 --> 01:10:29.620
Toula's got a lot of cousins. Fix you up.

01:10:30.740 --> 01:10:32.140
Yeah, that's gonna happen.

01:10:42.820 --> 01:10:43.900
What is wrong?

01:10:47.780 --> 01:10:48.740
All right.

01:10:50.060 --> 01:10:51.460
Is my marriage killing Dad?

01:10:52.740 --> 01:10:55.260
Toula, your father is your father.

01:10:56.260 --> 01:10:57.900
He just wants you to be happy.

01:10:58.620 --> 01:11:00.060
But I am happy.

01:11:07.940 --> 01:11:09.060
Listen to me.

01:11:09.460 --> 01:11:11.900
My village saw many wars...

01:11:13.380 --> 01:11:15.340
Turkish, German...

01:11:16.060 --> 01:11:17.900
they all made a mess.

01:11:20.740 --> 01:11:23.180
And my mother, she said:

01:11:23.500 --> 01:11:25.700
"We're lucky to be alive."

01:11:26.380 --> 01:11:29.660
And I thought, "We're not lucky to be alive.

01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:33.020
"We're not lucky, when they are telling us...

01:11:33.380 --> 01:11:36.100
"where we should live, what we should eat."

01:11:36.540 --> 01:11:38.580
Nobody has that right.

01:11:40.700 --> 01:11:42.740
And then, I see you.

01:11:44.100 --> 01:11:46.460
And I see Athena and Niko.

01:11:48.020 --> 01:11:49.660
We came here for you.

01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:53.180
So you could live.

01:11:55.140 --> 01:11:58.980
I gave you life, so that you could live it.

01:13:37.260 --> 01:13:40.460
Ma, the band needs to be picked up
at the airport.

01:13:48.580 --> 01:13:49.740
Surprise!

01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:56.660
Wait, what is that?

01:13:57.060 --> 01:13:58.300
No.

01:14:00.220 --> 01:14:01.540
My God!

01:14:07.220 --> 01:14:08.700
Where did everybody go?

01:14:14.820 --> 01:14:16.220
It is a mosquito bite.

01:14:16.300 --> 01:14:17.860
- It's a zit.
- I have cover-up.

01:14:20.860 --> 01:14:22.700
Hello, ladies, fresh baklava.

01:14:24.780 --> 01:14:27.300
- Get out of here.
- Give me the camera.

01:14:28.260 --> 01:14:29.500
Give me the camera.

01:14:29.860 --> 01:14:31.500
Toula. Help me.

01:14:33.060 --> 01:14:34.220
No boys allowed!

01:14:34.300 --> 01:14:36.220
- Nice moustache, Nikki.
- Thank you.

01:14:36.300 --> 01:14:37.540
Niko, let's go.

01:14:37.580 --> 01:14:39.380
- Dad, is that my tux?
- No, this one.

01:14:39.460 --> 01:14:41.820
Nick, go to the airport and pick up the band.

01:14:41.860 --> 01:14:43.140
Okay.

01:14:43.180 --> 01:14:44.860
Hey, what's that thing?

01:14:45.380 --> 01:14:46.700
It's a mosquito bite.

01:14:47.340 --> 01:14:48.500
Put some Windex.

01:14:50.260 --> 01:14:51.620
I've got the cover-up.

01:14:51.940 --> 01:14:53.100
Bravo!

01:14:53.380 --> 01:14:54.820
You're all nuts.

01:14:55.140 --> 01:14:56.980
We've got another one.

01:14:57.060 --> 01:14:59.900
You are supposed to get changed
at my house. Get out.

01:15:01.780 --> 01:15:03.140
Let me pop it!

01:15:05.780 --> 01:15:06.860
There she is.

01:15:06.940 --> 01:15:08.620
Toula, I want to talk to you.

01:15:08.700 --> 01:15:09.540
Now?

01:15:09.700 --> 01:15:11.780
This is a very special night for you.

01:15:12.620 --> 01:15:13.860
You have your duties.

01:15:13.900 --> 01:15:16.860
One more, one big one, hold on.

01:15:18.340 --> 01:15:19.740
Listen, Toula.

01:15:20.180 --> 01:15:21.460
On my wedding night...

01:15:21.860 --> 01:15:23.500
my mother, she said to me:

01:15:24.260 --> 01:15:27.740
"Greek women,
we may be lambs in the kitchen...

01:15:28.500 --> 01:15:30.420
"but we are tigers in the bedroom."

01:15:31.260 --> 01:15:33.620
Please, let that be the end of your speech.

01:15:33.700 --> 01:15:37.380
What is going on here? Why isn't anyone
ready? The photographer's here.

01:15:48.060 --> 01:15:50.060
- You need sponging?
- I'm all right.

01:16:08.260 --> 01:16:12.260
More. More on the top. That's it.
More hairspray.

01:16:19.180 --> 01:16:20.420
Oh, Maria!

01:16:21.380 --> 01:16:23.260
So beautiful.

01:16:25.380 --> 01:16:26.380
She's ready!

01:16:42.620 --> 01:16:44.180
I'm a snow beast.

01:16:45.060 --> 01:16:46.460
You not a snow beast.

01:17:44.700 --> 01:17:45.660
My God!

01:18:36.180 --> 01:18:38.580
How are we supposed to know
what's going on?

01:18:38.660 --> 01:18:40.260
It's all Greek to me.

01:18:40.740 --> 01:18:41.700
Rodney!

01:19:05.700 --> 01:19:07.060
This is it.

01:19:08.740 --> 01:19:09.660
What?

01:19:11.460 --> 01:19:13.020
We take our first steps...

01:19:13.260 --> 01:19:14.900
as husband and wife.

01:19:17.300 --> 01:19:18.460
Are you ready?

01:19:18.540 --> 01:19:19.580
I'm ready.

01:20:21.860 --> 01:20:24.540
- Where are you? Are you in there?
- Yes!

01:20:25.900 --> 01:20:28.260
Don't dab. Wipe, wipe off.

01:20:29.580 --> 01:20:31.180
- Is that better?
- Yes.

01:20:33.380 --> 01:20:35.100
Who did your makeup? Your aunts?

01:20:36.660 --> 01:20:39.380
Drag queens could get a few tips
from those aunts.

01:20:39.900 --> 01:20:42.660
Oh, my God. Look at me. I'm just covered!

01:20:43.100 --> 01:20:45.580
- Like a big, frosted cupcake.
- I know, it's like...

01:20:47.180 --> 01:20:48.860
Come on, help me with the veil.

01:20:58.300 --> 01:20:59.940
- Hey.
- Yeah, you got it.

01:21:13.780 --> 01:21:15.220
Do we have to go in?

01:21:16.300 --> 01:21:17.860
Too late to elope now.

01:21:19.100 --> 01:21:20.380
Let's go in.

01:21:21.580 --> 01:21:22.620
Okay.

01:21:23.620 --> 01:21:24.700
Check this out.

01:21:25.940 --> 01:21:27.780
It's going down. Thank God.

01:21:28.140 --> 01:21:29.180
What?

01:21:29.260 --> 01:21:32.100
I woke up with this huge zit this morning.

01:21:33.260 --> 01:21:34.780
- Where?
- There.

01:21:34.860 --> 01:21:36.860
- I had a huge zit this morning.
- You did?

01:21:36.940 --> 01:21:38.180
- Yeah.
- Where is it?

01:21:38.260 --> 01:21:40.100
Well, it was right here. But it's gone.

01:21:40.140 --> 01:21:41.140
Why?

01:21:41.220 --> 01:21:42.740
I put some Windex on it.

01:22:18.340 --> 01:22:19.380
Hello.

01:22:23.300 --> 01:22:26.540
Welcome to the Portokalos family.

01:22:27.900 --> 01:22:29.980
And welcome...

01:22:30.060 --> 01:22:32.180
the Miller family.

01:22:33.460 --> 01:22:36.300
I was thinking, last night...

01:22:37.660 --> 01:22:39.420
the night before...

01:22:39.580 --> 01:22:43.140
my daughter was going to marry lan Miller...

01:22:43.740 --> 01:22:48.020
that the root of the word "miller"...

01:22:48.180 --> 01:22:49.260
is a Greek word.

01:22:49.580 --> 01:22:52.740
And "miller" come from...

01:22:52.820 --> 01:22:54.740
the Greek word milo...

01:22:55.060 --> 01:22:56.860
which is mean "apple. "

01:22:57.220 --> 01:22:58.180
There you go.

01:23:02.300 --> 01:23:04.220
As many of you know...

01:23:04.500 --> 01:23:06.340
our name Portokalos...

01:23:06.500 --> 01:23:09.220
is come from the Greek word portokali...

01:23:09.540 --> 01:23:11.420
which means "orange. "

01:23:11.940 --> 01:23:13.420
So, okay...

01:23:13.780 --> 01:23:15.020
here tonight...

01:23:15.140 --> 01:23:18.540
we have apple and orange.

01:23:20.860 --> 01:23:23.060
We all different...

01:23:23.700 --> 01:23:27.060
but, in the end, we all fruit.

01:23:31.300 --> 01:23:32.700
Yes, we are all fruit.

01:23:37.460 --> 01:23:39.660
My wife and me, we have a gift.

01:23:40.660 --> 01:23:42.780
That's what we do. The parents give a gift.

01:23:48.860 --> 01:23:49.900
Here.

01:23:56.700 --> 01:23:57.660
My God!

01:23:58.900 --> 01:24:00.300
They bought us a house.

01:24:33.940 --> 01:24:34.980
Thank you.

01:24:40.900 --> 01:24:41.900
I love you.

01:24:43.660 --> 01:24:44.940
I love you, too.

01:24:48.020 --> 01:24:49.540
I don't believe it.

01:24:50.180 --> 01:24:51.300
A house!

01:25:01.700 --> 01:25:03.460
Thia Voula, we're going to dance.

01:25:03.540 --> 01:25:05.980
- I know, dear. Let me get Taki.
- Okay.

01:25:06.180 --> 01:25:08.900
Athena, I'm going to be a painter.

01:25:09.100 --> 01:25:11.460
Good. You can start with our fence.

01:25:13.940 --> 01:25:16.660
This is just a really nice wedding.

01:25:16.740 --> 01:25:19.100
Good. We're going to dance now. Come on.

01:25:19.180 --> 01:25:20.100
No.

01:25:20.180 --> 01:25:22.700
I'll need a little more ouzo before I do that.

01:25:22.780 --> 01:25:24.420
What do you say?

01:25:27.340 --> 01:25:28.660
Bottoms up.

01:25:32.220 --> 01:25:33.860
- All right.
- Let's go, Harry.

01:25:35.940 --> 01:25:37.220
Come on, Kosta.

01:25:37.540 --> 01:25:39.420
All right.

01:25:43.540 --> 01:25:45.100
Oh, Taki.

01:25:46.020 --> 01:25:47.500
He looks Greek.

01:26:11.300 --> 01:26:12.780
Yia sou, lan.

01:26:20.940 --> 01:26:23.740
Sometimes, I'm afraid that it didn't happen.

01:26:23.780 --> 01:26:27.060
I'm scared I'll wake up
and still be buttering garlic bread...

01:26:27.140 --> 01:26:29.180
waiting for my life to start.

01:26:29.260 --> 01:26:31.140
But it did happen. It did!

01:26:31.460 --> 01:26:33.020
And I figured out some stuff.

01:26:33.220 --> 01:26:35.220
My family is big and loud...

01:26:35.500 --> 01:26:36.820
but they're my family.

01:26:36.940 --> 01:26:38.660
We fight and we laugh.

01:26:38.820 --> 01:26:41.380
And yes, we roast lamb on a spit
in the front yard.

01:26:41.940 --> 01:26:44.220
And wherever I go, whatever I do...

01:26:44.820 --> 01:26:46.460
they will always be there.

01:26:53.540 --> 01:26:56.740
So, lan and I moved into the house
my parents bought us.

01:26:57.100 --> 01:26:58.740
A minute later, I was pregnant.

01:26:58.820 --> 01:27:02.060
And six years later, it was our
daughter's turn to go to Greek school.

01:27:02.140 --> 01:27:04.220
Mom, I want to go to Brownies.

01:27:04.260 --> 01:27:06.500
I know, but I promise you this.

01:27:06.700 --> 01:27:09.060
You can marry anybody you want.

01:27:09.500 --> 01:27:11.300
Thanks, baby.

01:27:11.820 --> 01:27:13.060
Greek school, pame.

01:27:14.740 --> 01:27:15.700
What's that mean?

01:27:15.780 --> 01:27:16.740
"Let's go."

01:27:16.820 --> 01:27:18.420
- Let's go.
- That's pretty good.

01:27:18.500 --> 01:27:19.940
- Looking good, Gus.
- Hi, Dad.

01:27:20.020 --> 01:27:21.620
- Where you going?
- Greek school.

01:27:22.300 --> 01:27:23.260
Baklava!
