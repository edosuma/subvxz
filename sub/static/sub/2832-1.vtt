DON: <i>There's an old expression
that marriage is like</i>

01:00.645 --> 01:02.438
<i>a phone call in the night.</i>

01:02.522 --> 01:05.692
<i>First comes the ring, and then you wake up.</i>

01:08.778 --> 01:10.321

01:14.784 --> 01:18.580
<i>Or whichever it was
that ultimately led to our divorce.</i>

01:18.663 --> 01:20.915
<i>But we never stopped loving each other.</i>

01:20.999 --> 01:23.418

beautiful children?</i>

01:23.501 --> 01:28.381
<i>Jared, Lyla, and our
adopted son, Alejandro.</i>

01:29.674 --> 01:31.551
<i>We had built a home, and a history,</i>

01:31.634 --> 01:32.760

01:32.844 --> 01:34.137

Hello?

01:43.354 --> 01:44.772
(CHUCKLES)

01:51.988 --> 01:53.114
Oh, wow.

01:59.704 --> 02:01.080
(SNIFFS) Ugh!

02:09.714 --> 02:11.090
Oh.

02:11.883 --> 02:13.009
Yep.

02:17.096 --> 02:18.556
(CHUCKLING)

02:21.100 --> 02:23.728
(GASPS) Look at them.

02:23.811 --> 02:25.480
(GASPS) Oh.

02:26.522 --> 02:27.649
Oof.

02:27.732 --> 02:28.900
(DOOR OPENING)

02:29.108 --> 02:30.777
DON: I mean, you can't be serious.

02:30.860 --> 02:32.987
I mean, it's really that
gargantuan of a deal?

02:33.071 --> 02:34.197
BEBE: It's blasphemy.

02:34.280 --> 02:35.323
(BARKS)

02:35.406 --> 02:36.806
DON: Which do you think came first?

02:36.866 --> 02:39.035
The Catholic Church, or cunnilingus?

02:39.118 --> 02:41.663
Oh. Please do not use that language.

02:41.746 --> 02:43.373
What do you mean,
I can't say "Catholic Church"?

02:43.456 --> 02:44.749
- No. The other thing.
(BARKS)

02:44.832 --> 02:45.875
Hercules, be quiet.

02:45.958 --> 02:47.039
What do I use in its place?

02:47.043 --> 02:48.126
You know, when it comes up in conversation.

02:48.127 --> 02:49.127
Well, that is the point.

02:49.128 --> 02:50.797
It's not supposed to
come up in conversation.

02:50.880 --> 02:52.006
DON: How about chowing box?

02:52.090 --> 02:53.131
BEBE: Stop it, Donald.

02:53.132 --> 02:55.133
- Muff diving? Huh?
- Stop. You're so bad.

02:55.134 --> 02:56.386
Poon jab?

02:56.552 --> 02:57.887
(LAUGHING) Poon job?

02:57.970 --> 03:00.348
Well, I just had lunch, but if you insist.

03:00.431 --> 03:01.683
Oh, Donny!

03:02.016 --> 03:03.434
Oh, my...

03:03.726 --> 03:05.144
- Cunnilingus.
(MOANS)

03:05.353 --> 03:07.021
You are such a slut.

03:07.271 --> 03:09.148
Lucky girl. (GROWLS)

03:10.358 --> 03:12.150
(GASPS) Ohh!
(DON GROANS)

03:12.151 --> 03:14.152
- Sorry. Oh, my...
DON: - Oh, jeez!

03:14.153 --> 03:15.655
- Eleanor?
- Oh!

03:15.738 --> 03:17.156
- Hi.
- Hi.

03:17.240 --> 03:20.034
Oh, my God. I don't...
Really, I'm so terribly sorry.

03:20.493 --> 03:21.911
He told me that nobody was here.

03:21.994 --> 03:23.371
And I don't know why he did.
The key was over...

03:23.454 --> 03:24.455
Anyway, I'm just...

03:24.539 --> 03:25.540
I'm gonna... You know what I'm gonna do?

03:25.623 --> 03:27.166
Oh, my goodness. Ellie?

03:27.250 --> 03:28.793
- Hi, Bebe.
- Hi.

03:28.876 --> 03:30.670
You look, um... You look wonderful.

03:30.753 --> 03:32.171
Thanks. But, um...

03:32.255 --> 03:34.006
Gosh, it's been such a long time.

03:34.090 --> 03:35.258
It's great to see you. I hardly...

03:35.341 --> 03:36.551
I hardly recognize you.

03:36.801 --> 03:38.261
I mean, you look so...

03:38.594 --> 03:40.138
- So?
- So... So...

03:40.179 --> 03:41.764
- Unexpected.
BEBE: - Unexpected.

03:42.181 --> 03:43.821
- No, that's not...
- Hey, there's Donald.

03:43.933 --> 03:46.060
Ellie. You look like a summer day.

03:46.185 --> 03:47.437
Oh, well, that's because
you're on the floor.

03:47.520 --> 03:49.188
Hey, what else is new?

03:49.814 --> 03:50.857
ELLIE: Oh, Oh.

03:50.940 --> 03:52.191
Yeah. Thanks.

03:54.193 --> 03:55.403
- Oh...
- Oh.

03:55.486 --> 03:56.654
How long's it been?

03:56.904 --> 03:59.365
- Ooh, ten years.
- Impossible. Oh!

03:59.449 --> 04:01.325
- Oh, you're not, I'm...
- Ooh! Oh, no, that's okay.

04:01.409 --> 04:03.201
- No, that's just...
- The little blue helper.

04:03.202 --> 04:05.163
What goes up doesn't always come down.

04:05.204 --> 04:06.622
It's like a blue thing, like that.

04:06.706 --> 04:08.332
I thought you weren't getting in
till around 5:00.

04:08.416 --> 04:09.459
6:30.

04:09.542 --> 04:10.585
You didn't tell me that.

04:10.668 --> 04:11.669
Well, that's fine.

04:11.753 --> 04:13.921
I just took a little stroll
through the village,

04:14.005 --> 04:17.925
and it's just so amazing
how little things have changed.

04:18.134 --> 04:19.510
(ALL LAUGHING)

04:21.095 --> 04:22.221
Oh, God.

04:22.263 --> 04:24.640
Honey, why don't you
take her up to the Embroidery Room.

04:24.724 --> 04:26.267
I'm gonna round up some sheets.

04:26.350 --> 04:27.560
At your service, madame.

04:27.810 --> 04:29.854
- Right this way.
- Oh, thank you.

04:30.229 --> 04:32.064
The Embroidery Room?

04:32.148 --> 04:35.693
Oh, your old office. I don't go in there.

04:36.194 --> 04:37.278
She's got you on the wagon?

04:37.361 --> 04:40.573
I ain't had a steak or a
drink in three years.

04:41.073 --> 04:42.617
I can't sculpt worth a fart,

04:42.700 --> 04:44.242
but they give me a lollipop

04:44.243 --> 04:45.912
every time I leave the cardiologist.

04:46.204 --> 04:47.245
ELLIE: Where are the kids?

04:47.246 --> 04:50.458
Jared's at work
and AI's enjoying Pre-Cana with Missy.

04:50.541 --> 04:51.542
Pre-Cana, oh, no.

04:51.626 --> 04:53.251
You mean the Catholic
thing with the priest?

04:53.252 --> 04:55.171
Yeah, you know the O'Connors.

04:55.254 --> 04:56.672
(BELL TOLLING)

04:59.509 --> 05:02.887
MOINIGHAN: Matrimony
is God's greatest gift to his children.

05:02.970 --> 05:05.348
To be sanctified, nurtured and protected

05:05.431 --> 05:07.391
against the seeds of dissent,

05:07.475 --> 05:09.852
we're told too often
lead to the chasms of discord,

05:09.936 --> 05:11.771
from which too often many of today's unions

05:11.854 --> 05:13.064
are unable to recover.

05:13.981 --> 05:17.318
It all too often leads to
divorce, which is a sin

05:18.152 --> 05:19.278
in the eyes of God.

05:19.862 --> 05:21.364
But no pressure.

05:22.240 --> 05:26.285
Melissa, how long have
you and this young man been courting?

05:27.286 --> 05:29.287
Just over a year.

05:29.288 --> 05:32.166
But we've known
each other since middle school.

05:32.333 --> 05:34.168
Alejandro, is it?

05:36.295 --> 05:37.575
You do speak English, don't you?

05:37.755 --> 05:39.549
No. No, actually, I don't.

05:39.632 --> 05:41.676
(CHUCKLES)
- Oh, I see.

05:41.759 --> 05:43.177
He just graduated from Harvard.

05:43.302 --> 05:45.179
Him and half of China. (CHUCKLES)

05:45.304 --> 05:46.848
(SPEAKING MAN DARIN)

05:48.850 --> 05:50.017
(CHAIR CREAKS)

05:50.101 --> 05:51.727
He also speaks five languages,

05:51.811 --> 05:53.145
English being very much one of them.

05:53.229 --> 05:54.230
Really?

05:54.313 --> 05:56.816
So, tell me this, Alejandro.

05:57.650 --> 06:01.404
Have you been successful thus far
at being intimate with young Mellissa?

06:03.072 --> 06:04.198
Excuse me, sir?

06:04.282 --> 06:06.742
Father Moinighan's just fine, son.

06:06.826 --> 06:08.494
What I'm asking is,

06:09.328 --> 06:12.456
is Miss O'Connor's virginity still intact?

06:17.962 --> 06:20.338
(CLICKS TONGUE) I see.

06:20.339 --> 06:23.634
And, uh, did we partake of birth control?

06:23.718 --> 06:26.053
- Of course.
- Ah, of course.

06:26.137 --> 06:28.346
(MOINIGHAN CLICKING TONGUE)

06:28.347 --> 06:29.932
Birth control.

06:30.016 --> 06:31.809
Relationships between consenting adults

06:31.893 --> 06:33.644
shall remain privately betwixt themselves,

06:33.728 --> 06:35.353
and the Church, of course.

06:35.354 --> 06:36.606
I guess we're going to Hell, then.

06:36.689 --> 06:38.399
In God's good time, my son.

06:39.025 --> 06:40.359
I'm kidding.

06:40.902 --> 06:42.111
So, tell me, young man.

06:42.194 --> 06:44.697
I know your adoptive
parents, Don and Ellie,

06:44.780 --> 06:46.365
are other than Catholic.

06:46.449 --> 06:48.159
Yeah. Yeah. My mom is Je-Buddhist.

06:48.242 --> 06:50.036
That's Jewish/Buddhist.

06:50.119 --> 06:51.746
And my father thinks that
organized religion is for...

06:51.829 --> 06:55.541
His biological mother is
very much a Catholic.

06:55.625 --> 06:57.501
She works for a bishop in Colombia.

06:57.585 --> 06:59.377
- Good for her.
MISSY: - And we're very excited

06:59.378 --> 07:01.881
because we just
found out that she's coming to the wedding.

07:01.964 --> 07:03.466
- She is.
- Oh, wonderful.

07:06.385 --> 07:07.470
- Oh, God.
- Yes?

07:10.139 --> 07:11.140
What?

07:12.224 --> 07:13.643
Sorry. Nothing. It's fine.

07:13.726 --> 07:16.270
I'm assuming that your mother
will be very encouraging

07:16.354 --> 07:18.689
of her grandchildren
being raised in the Church.

07:20.399 --> 07:22.860
Uh, actually, we decided to wait
until they're old enough

07:22.944 --> 07:24.403
and then just let them decide.

07:25.154 --> 07:26.906
Hell it is, then.

07:30.284 --> 07:31.410
(EXHALES)

07:38.417 --> 07:40.044
Hi. Is Jared in?

07:40.127 --> 07:41.545
- Are you a patient?
- Sister.

07:41.629 --> 07:43.506
JANE: Oh. Oh. Right.

07:43.589 --> 07:45.299
- Hi, I'm Jane.
- Hi.

07:45.383 --> 07:47.802
He's in a delivery,
so you can wait over in the Daddy's Room

07:47.885 --> 07:49.178
and I'll let him know that you're here.

07:49.261 --> 07:50.596
Okay.

07:51.722 --> 07:52.932
Hello.

she literally pulled it out of the socket.

08:02.441 --> 08:03.442
(SIGHS)

08:03.484 --> 08:05.443
- I figured I'd be a lot safer here.
- Thank Christ.

08:05.444 --> 08:06.696
Are you freaking kidding me?

08:07.863 --> 08:09.365
We're in a hospital.

08:09.448 --> 08:10.616
(CHUCKLES)

08:11.200 --> 08:13.077
Right. Sorry.

08:13.452 --> 08:15.204
Just practicing.

08:15.663 --> 08:17.957
I don't even smoke. I quit a month ago.

08:18.040 --> 08:19.250
It's a girl.

08:19.333 --> 08:21.794
Oh, my God. I gotta call you back.
Is she...

08:21.877 --> 08:23.461
They're both doing just fine.

08:23.462 --> 08:24.543
Would you like to meet her?

08:30.469 --> 08:32.054

There you are.

08:44.442 --> 08:45.483
LYLA: Am I dead?

08:45.484 --> 08:48.779
Sorry. Jared'll be in in a sec.

08:48.863 --> 08:50.156
My hero.

08:50.448 --> 08:51.490
He's a sweetie, huh?

08:51.532 --> 08:52.700
Hmm.

08:53.659 --> 08:57.246
I hope this isn't too inappropriate to ask,

08:57.496 --> 09:00.166
but is it true that he's
never really had...

09:00.499 --> 09:01.500
It's true.

09:02.168 --> 09:03.169
Oh.

09:03.252 --> 09:05.503
Okay. What kind of a doily

09:05.504 --> 09:07.173
passes out in the Daddy's Room?

09:09.842 --> 09:11.719
- I hope you feel better.
- Thank you.

09:11.802 --> 09:13.512
- Doctor.
- Thank you.

09:13.679 --> 09:15.598
Thank you. (HUMMING)

09:15.681 --> 09:16.807
She's perky.

09:17.516 --> 09:19.268
Who, Jane? Yeah, she's great.

09:19.351 --> 09:20.728
She's screaming for a shot at the title.

09:20.811 --> 09:21.812
Nice.

09:21.896 --> 09:23.416
What could possibly be wrong with her?

09:24.190 --> 09:27.860
I am so over this whole
fresh-faced, Ivy League,

09:27.943 --> 09:29.653
preppie, bouncy, ponytail-y type.

09:30.029 --> 09:31.509
Don't you have to be under one first?

09:31.530 --> 09:32.530
Good one.

09:32.531 --> 09:33.574
She knows, by the way.

09:33.657 --> 09:34.867
Yeah. A bunch of us went out

09:34.950 --> 09:36.535
for too many margaritas last month.

09:36.660 --> 09:39.997
Now they have, like, an
un-virgin pool going.

09:40.081 --> 09:41.082
What?

09:41.165 --> 09:44.085
A bevy of hot nurses
are conspiring to bang your brains out?

09:44.168 --> 09:45.503
You should press charges.

09:45.836 --> 09:49.340
No, not my brother. He's
gotta wait for love.

09:49.423 --> 09:50.548
Yeah, well...

09:50.549 --> 09:52.927
It seemed like
a really noble idea when I was 15.

09:53.010 --> 09:55.096
Anyway, I'm starting to waver.

09:55.179 --> 09:56.472
Shut up.

09:56.680 --> 09:57.890
No, I'm gonna be 30 soon.

09:57.973 --> 10:00.558
But then that would mean
that I've wasted the last

10:00.559 --> 10:02.228
15-plus years.

10:03.395 --> 10:04.438
You're fine.

10:04.522 --> 10:06.564
Well, call what's-her-name back in here.

10:06.565 --> 10:07.900
Come on. You can use my bed.

10:07.983 --> 10:10.444
I'll wait in the hall. I
can laugh really quietly.

10:10.528 --> 10:13.447
Or I could just
put you back in there with the babies.

10:13.531 --> 10:14.573
No.

10:15.074 --> 10:16.075
Oh.

10:16.158 --> 10:17.868
Whoa, whoa. You okay?

10:18.661 --> 10:19.662
(EXHALES)

10:19.829 --> 10:20.830
I want you to...

10:21.580 --> 10:23.999
Look right at me. Right at my nose.

10:26.877 --> 10:28.963
Yeah, you might have a concussion.

10:29.046 --> 10:30.256
How will I know?

10:30.339 --> 10:32.216
Headaches, vomiting.

10:32.299 --> 10:34.468
Hmm. And I haven't even seen Dad yet.

10:34.552 --> 10:35.553
(CHUCKLES)

10:36.554 --> 10:38.013
Hey. Where's Andrew?

10:38.097 --> 10:40.224
I don't know. Can we bookmark it?

10:40.307 --> 10:44.145
I want to keep the whole "Lyla's desiccating
her life" lectures down to one a day.

10:44.228 --> 10:45.354
I can't wait.

10:45.437 --> 10:46.605
See you, Jared.

10:47.314 --> 10:48.566
Neither can they.

10:51.861 --> 10:53.529
He's huge.

10:53.779 --> 10:55.613
(BOTH GASPING)

11:00.619 --> 11:02.580

11:04.540 --> 11:05.916
Look at Jared.

11:06.834 --> 11:07.835
(CHUCKLES)

11:08.252 --> 11:12.256
Lyla. Oh, look how tiny Alejandro was.

11:13.507 --> 11:15.843
BEBE: One of the workers
almost painted over that

11:15.926 --> 11:17.178
while we were redecorating.

11:17.261 --> 11:20.639
I had my knitting needle to his throat
when Donald pulled me off of him.

11:20.681 --> 11:23.559
ELLIE: Yeah. And now they're all grown.

11:23.642 --> 11:24.643
Yeah.

11:25.269 --> 11:26.896
You were so wonderful to them.

11:27.980 --> 11:30.649
Well, they're not
officially my kids, but, you know...

11:31.400 --> 11:33.027
God, you look stunning.

11:33.110 --> 11:36.447
Cut the crap, Bebes.
I look a decade older and so do you.

11:36.989 --> 11:39.658
Said the one of us not
wearing control tops.

11:40.409 --> 11:44.371
Wait until you see Muffin. Oh, my God.

11:44.455 --> 11:45.748
I heard she had work done.

11:45.831 --> 11:47.958
Really, like, somebody said it was scary.

11:48.042 --> 11:51.212
Well, let's just say most of her face
is now behind her ears.

11:51.295 --> 11:52.975
(LAUGHING)
- And she's completely mental.

11:53.047 --> 11:55.466
She's driving me crazy
about the details of the wedding,

11:55.549 --> 11:57.718
which is ironic because
we're hosting it here.

11:57.801 --> 11:58.802
- Right.
- Right?

11:58.886 --> 12:00.930
And I'm catering it. Organic, of course.

12:01.805 --> 12:04.433
Oh, God, I was just so
terrified to see you.

12:04.767 --> 12:08.646
Oh, don't be.
I mean, look, it was a long time ago.

12:09.605 --> 12:10.648
So...

12:10.689 --> 12:13.734
Yeah. Well, now that you're here,
I realize how much I missed you.

12:13.817 --> 12:16.445
Well. Hey, I want to say something.

12:16.528 --> 12:17.695
- This house?
- Yeah?

12:17.696 --> 12:19.365
It looks absolutely incredible.

12:19.448 --> 12:21.367
When were you two married, anyway?

12:21.450 --> 12:24.702
Oh, we weren't. I don't need a ring.

12:24.703 --> 12:26.747
I mean, maybe
I'd like to have a ring some time, but...

12:26.830 --> 12:27.831
You should tell him.

12:27.915 --> 12:29.458
He knows. He knows.

12:29.541 --> 12:32.419
Doesn't exactly back stroke
through the deep end

12:32.503 --> 12:33.712
of the sensitivity pool.

12:33.754 --> 12:35.422
Hey. Look at you two.

12:35.506 --> 12:37.091
Haven't seen this much tail around here

12:37.216 --> 12:38.592
since the last poochie died.

12:40.135 --> 12:41.887
(BOTH LAUGH POLITELY)

12:45.099 --> 12:46.725
LYLA: Oh, Well.

12:49.186 --> 12:50.479
JARED: Welcome to the jungle.

12:50.562 --> 12:52.147
I truly loathe this place.

12:52.231 --> 12:56.734
Oh. Is that because you've hooked up
with, like, half the staff?

12:56.735 --> 12:58.536
It was high school.
And hand jobs don't count.

12:58.612 --> 12:59.655
Oh, thank God.

12:59.738 --> 13:02.950
LYLA: Hi. Oh, look at you.
You look gorgeous.

13:03.033 --> 13:05.286
Oh, so do you.
Oh, my God, your hair, I love it.

13:05.369 --> 13:07.162
- Thanks.
- I'm so glad you're here.

13:07.246 --> 13:08.746
- Sister.
- Immigrant.

13:08.747 --> 13:10.748
- Ambulance chaser.
- Partner.

13:10.749 --> 13:14.628
Hey, good for you. Where's Andrew?

13:15.629 --> 13:17.089
- Oh, God.
- Are you okay?

13:17.172 --> 13:19.341
- I gotta sit down.
- Come. Come.

13:21.593 --> 13:22.760
She's drunk already?

13:22.761 --> 13:25.681
Mild concussion. This should be fun.

13:27.308 --> 13:29.810
MISSY: It's, like, as
soon as we got engaged,

13:29.893 --> 13:33.147
it suddenly dawned on them
that he's not Caucasian.

13:33.230 --> 13:34.606
Wait, you're not Caucasian?

13:34.690 --> 13:35.899
Not at the moment.

13:35.983 --> 13:37.359
JARED: Well, that's upsetting.

13:37.443 --> 13:39.278
They're, like,
putting on this whole dinner theater,

13:39.361 --> 13:41.196
PC act, pretending to be really cool,

13:41.280 --> 13:42.656
but really they're freaking out

13:42.740 --> 13:43.781
that they're gonna have beige grandkids.

13:43.782 --> 13:45.103
Isn't that a little hypocritical,

13:45.159 --> 13:46.952
considering your father's
being investigated for...

13:47.036 --> 13:49.913
There's my little princess!

13:50.914 --> 13:52.708
Darling. A wisp.

13:52.791 --> 13:53.792
No, it's fine.

13:53.834 --> 13:55.793
Sweetheart, you know the Corns.

13:55.794 --> 13:57.379
- Hi.
MISSY: - Hi. Good to see you.

13:57.463 --> 14:00.798
And this is her friend Alejandro.

14:00.799 --> 14:02.593
MAN: - Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Hey.

14:02.676 --> 14:04.386
- AI is fine.
MAN: - Good. AI.

14:04.803 --> 14:06.804
- Well, hello, Lyla.
- Muffin.

14:06.805 --> 14:07.890
How's Chicago?

14:08.640 --> 14:10.684
Crawling with spics and Jews.

14:21.153 --> 14:24.239
I need, uh, a drink.

14:24.615 --> 14:25.824
Babe, hey.

14:27.117 --> 14:28.702
Thanks, babe.

14:29.370 --> 14:31.080
ELLIE: - There she is.
- Okay.

14:32.831 --> 14:34.375
Hello, sweetheart.

14:34.458 --> 14:35.709
How are you?

14:35.793 --> 14:36.834
Donald.

14:36.835 --> 14:38.295
You look breathtaking.

14:38.921 --> 14:39.963
You've packed on a few.

14:40.047 --> 14:41.924
You know, only in the good spots. But...

14:43.467 --> 14:46.387
Do you... Well, is it okay if I...

14:46.470 --> 14:48.722
Actually, I'm just...
I'm not feeling so hot right now.

14:48.806 --> 14:50.557
Oh, hey. I miss you so much.

14:50.641 --> 14:51.642
LYLA: Oh, hey.

14:51.850 --> 14:54.395
I wasn't actually kidding.
I really don't feel well.

14:54.478 --> 14:55.854
I really wish we could spend some time,

14:55.896 --> 14:56.980
- you know, just the three...
- Dad!

15:09.868 --> 15:12.287
Okay. So much better.

Rehearsal dinner tomorrow.

15:16.125 --> 15:17.501
Saturday wedding at the house.

15:17.584 --> 15:19.586
And where are we going on our honeymoon?

15:19.670 --> 15:22.005
Vietnam and Cambodia.

15:22.589 --> 15:24.882
Yeah. We suggested Venice,
but we don't count.

15:24.883 --> 15:26.844
Because it's safer.

15:26.885 --> 15:31.056
But also, of course, because Venice
is Alejandro's native language.

15:35.811 --> 15:37.104
Your name is Muffin.

15:37.896 --> 15:38.939
Yes.

15:40.482 --> 15:41.733
I love Cambodia.

15:41.817 --> 15:43.026
And it's perfectly safe.

15:43.110 --> 15:45.946
I know, because I lived
there for three months.

15:46.029 --> 15:47.906
Mom found herself in Asia.

15:48.449 --> 15:49.867
- What?

Don't you know Tantra?

15:55.205 --> 15:56.206
Is that how you say it?

15:56.331 --> 15:57.915
You had a nine-hour orgasm once?

- Seriously?

15:59.793 --> 16:00.919
That's gross.

16:01.753 --> 16:03.922

wouldn't kill you, young man.

16:03.964 --> 16:05.048
Okay.

16:05.132 --> 16:08.427
Or maybe a little less
self-exploration, in your case.

LYLA: - Right, virgy?

16:09.887 --> 16:11.221
- So it's on.
LYLA: - Oh, yeah.

One-nothing.

- Nine hours?
- Okay.

16:24.943 --> 16:26.612
Okay, I don't understand.
What's he talking about?

16:26.695 --> 16:27.945
- Andrew's moved out.

16:27.946 --> 16:28.947
He's moved out?

16:30.657 --> 16:31.658

16:31.742 --> 16:32.950
Because I'll tweeze his balls off.

16:32.951 --> 16:33.951
ELLIE: Oh, great idea.

16:33.952 --> 16:35.579
Yeah, 'cause karmically
that would make a ton of sense.

16:35.662 --> 16:36.663
What happened?

16:36.747 --> 16:37.955
We can talk about this later.

16:37.956 --> 16:38.957
Uh, you know what?

As long as it's come up,
let's just get it over with.

16:41.835 --> 16:43.086

16:43.170 --> 16:44.922
are just dying to hear all about

16:44.963 --> 16:47.216
the tests, and the injections,

16:47.299 --> 16:50.135
and humiliation I've so enjoyed
the last four years.

- Shh!

and he couldn't take it.

so I cut him loose before he did it to me.

17:20.832 --> 17:22.125
- No, no. No. I've got it.
- No, no. Don.

Yeah. Thought you were afraid of heights.

18:01.123 --> 18:02.207
The heights are fine.

It's the lows I'm not in love with.

Uh, spectacular.
I'll get there well before Christmas.

18:12.384 --> 18:14.970
father-daughter Kumbaya on a stick thing,

18:15.053 --> 18:16.513
but it just doesn't work that way.

18:16.597 --> 18:17.723
I'm gonna sit down.

18:17.806 --> 18:18.849
Okay.

18:20.726 --> 18:22.060
I know.

18:25.063 --> 18:27.774
Mom wasn't the only one you cheated on.

18:27.858 --> 18:29.066
I know.

18:29.067 --> 18:33.614
I still don't know how Bebe sleeps at night
in a house you and Mom built together.

18:33.697 --> 18:35.407
And the decent thing
would have been to just sell it,

18:35.490 --> 18:37.200
or burn the place down.

18:37.284 --> 18:38.327
I'm sorry.

18:38.410 --> 18:39.828
For what?

18:39.911 --> 18:42.247

turn out the way we want them to.

this thing with Andrew...

Don.

18:51.840 --> 18:53.091
Want my cosmo?

19:19.409 --> 19:21.118
I'm kind of nervous, actually.

Yeah. What? You don't have to be. Why?

19:23.121 --> 19:24.873
Well, because my sister's
never even left Colombia.

19:24.956 --> 19:25.999
That's plenty.

19:26.083 --> 19:28.085
Oh, really?
Is she as traditional as your mother?

19:28.126 --> 19:30.127
I think so. She's extremely shy. So...

19:30.128 --> 19:33.006
Well, listen to me.
We are going to make them feel

19:33.090 --> 19:35.926
as welcome and at home as we possibly can.

19:38.136 --> 19:39.471
to raise our kids Catholic

19:39.554 --> 19:41.138
or the priest won't even
perform the ceremony?

19:41.139 --> 19:43.684
Oh, come on. That's very
14th-century of him.

19:43.767 --> 19:44.927
- Right?
- Just, listen to me,

19:44.976 --> 19:48.689
cross your fingers behind your back,
and just say, "Hallelujah, Jesus."

19:48.772 --> 19:50.147
That's what Missy keeps saying.

19:50.148 --> 19:52.149
But it's the principle
of the whole thing, isn't it?

19:52.150 --> 19:53.944
No, it's not. It's marriage.

19:54.444 --> 19:58.407
One compromise down, 2.999 million to go.

19:59.157 --> 20:01.410
Speaking of compromises,

20:01.493 --> 20:06.164
I have something that I
need to ask you guys.

20:07.040 --> 20:08.165
Anything.

20:08.166 --> 20:10.877
It's just, it's... It's kind of a big one.

20:10.961 --> 20:12.170
(MUMBLING)

20:13.338 --> 20:14.756
Don? Oh, my God!

20:14.840 --> 20:16.842
Do you know what your son just told me?

20:16.925 --> 20:18.427
- Huh?
- Oh, my God.

20:18.510 --> 20:21.178
You know how the Catholics
have this thing about divorce?

20:21.179 --> 20:23.682
Well, it turns out that Madonna

20:23.765 --> 20:25.892
is under some sort of ridiculous impression

20:25.976 --> 20:28.562
that divorce is a great big, fat sin.

20:28.645 --> 20:29.646
Who's Madonna?

20:29.730 --> 20:32.149
AI's biological mother! What are you, nuts?

20:32.190 --> 20:33.190
I'm not listening.

20:33.191 --> 20:34.591
And she's also under the impression

20:34.609 --> 20:38.530
that of all the big, fat divorce sinners
in this whole big, wide world,

20:38.613 --> 20:40.907
you and I are not among them.

20:41.450 --> 20:42.534
- Uh...
- Don?

20:42.617 --> 20:44.202
Can you even hear what I'm saying?

20:44.244 --> 20:46.329
- Not remotely.
- We're not divorced!

20:46.413 --> 20:48.123
- Got it?
- What?

20:48.206 --> 20:50.751
For the next three days,
you and I are husband and wife.

20:50.834 --> 20:52.002
- What?
- Yes!

20:52.085 --> 20:53.920
Shit! (SCREAMS)

20:54.004 --> 20:55.422
(ELLIE SCREAMS)

20:56.214 --> 20:57.215
Don!

21:00.177 --> 21:02.220
I feel terrible.

21:04.306 --> 21:06.975
They're just letting
anyone into Harvard these days, huh?

21:07.058 --> 21:10.020
And you never told her
about them because...

21:10.854 --> 21:13.231
I mean, there was no way
she was ever gonna come here.

21:13.273 --> 21:16.109
It never even occurred to me
until that Pre-Cana.

21:16.318 --> 21:17.319
ELLIE: - Well, wait a minute.
- Oh.

21:17.402 --> 21:19.529
What would happen if she knew the truth?

21:19.613 --> 21:21.948
You told me what she put you
through during the adoption.

21:22.032 --> 21:25.243
She gave up her only son so that I
could have a chance at a better life.

21:25.327 --> 21:26.411
And now, she left Colombia,

21:26.495 --> 21:28.789
which she swore
she would never do. On an airplane,

21:28.872 --> 21:29.956
which she's petrified of,

21:30.040 --> 21:31.666
only to find out that
I've been lying to her

21:31.750 --> 21:32.834
about being raised by heathens

21:32.918 --> 21:34.336
for the past 15 years.

21:34.419 --> 21:36.421
- No offense.
- None taken.

21:36.713 --> 21:38.590
It'd break her poor little heart.

21:38.673 --> 21:40.842
Why don't we just fake it
for a of couple days? No big deal.

21:40.926 --> 21:43.303
ELLIE: And what makes either of you
think you could pull this off?

21:43.386 --> 21:47.057
Sweetie, there's just
one little part that I'm stuck on.

21:47.140 --> 21:49.266
If those two are still married,

21:49.267 --> 21:51.144
then what does that make me?

21:54.773 --> 21:55.899
My concubine?

21:58.360 --> 22:00.070
I hadn't really gotten there yet.

22:00.153 --> 22:01.488
- I see.
(CUTLERY CLATTERS)

22:02.280 --> 22:03.281
All right.

22:05.200 --> 22:06.743
More tea, anyone?

22:08.578 --> 22:10.287
I thought my life was a shit storm.

22:10.288 --> 22:11.623
I feel awful.

22:11.706 --> 22:13.507
Well, then what the hell
are you waiting for?

22:16.503 --> 22:17.629
This is gonna go great.

22:17.712 --> 22:20.552
Before we start shitting kittens,
why don't we just sit the old gal down

22:20.632 --> 22:22.509
and lay it all out for her?
You and I are divorced.

22:22.592 --> 22:24.803
It's not like we moved
to a fucking petting zoo or something.

22:24.886 --> 22:26.721
ELLIE: She's from another country.

22:26.805 --> 22:28.098
A very different country.

22:28.181 --> 22:29.850
And her values aren't the same as ours.

22:29.933 --> 22:31.434
So just pretend to be
married for the weekend.

22:31.518 --> 22:32.519
What's the big deal?

22:32.602 --> 22:33.923
Where would you like me to start?

22:33.979 --> 22:35.939
Hey, listen. You were no Mardi Gras, toots.

22:36.022 --> 22:37.065
What did you call me?

22:37.148 --> 22:38.525
DON: Let's get that straight. Oh.

22:38.608 --> 22:40.026
And it's an expression. It's an expression.

22:40.110 --> 22:42.362
Of endearment.
So don't get all Jane Fonda about it.

22:42.445 --> 22:44.321
ELLIE: Uh-huh. Well, you know, the Tibetans

22:44.322 --> 22:45.322
have a wonderful expression

22:45.323 --> 22:46.366
for moments like these as well.

22:46.449 --> 22:47.450
Yeah?

22:47.534 --> 22:50.327
Loosely translated,
it means, "Go fuck a yak, Don."

22:50.328 --> 22:53.123
That's the moment. I finally feel home.

22:53.206 --> 22:54.332
So, she's leaving.

22:55.333 --> 22:56.751
Some apology.
What is the matter with you? Why can't...

22:56.835 --> 22:57.961
She won't listen to me.

22:58.044 --> 22:59.336
She's not going anywhere.

22:59.337 --> 23:01.131
Honey, this is all very dramatic.

23:01.214 --> 23:02.716
- Can't we just...
- Put a sock in it, Donald.

23:02.799 --> 23:04.885
Let me help you with this.

23:04.968 --> 23:06.469
Let's go in the kitchen,
let's have some tea...

23:06.553 --> 23:08.972
- You hate my tea.
- I love your tea.

23:09.055 --> 23:10.265
BEBE: Really?
DON: Okay, okay.

23:10.348 --> 23:12.349
I do hate your tea.
But the rest of you is pure perfection.

23:12.350 --> 23:14.561
- Just take the suitcase.
- Honey, please. Look...

23:14.644 --> 23:15.979
ALEJANDRO: Bebe?

23:16.062 --> 23:17.147
- Jesus.
(DOG BARKING)

23:17.230 --> 23:19.983
I'll call Holly
and have her oversee the catering.

23:20.066 --> 23:21.943
I promise, we can figure this out.

23:22.027 --> 23:24.821
This weekend should be about you and Missy,

23:24.905 --> 23:25.947
and your happiness.

23:26.031 --> 23:28.950
And if my presence
means that that doesn't happen...

23:29.034 --> 23:31.286
But, Bebe, you're a big
part of that happiness.

23:31.369 --> 23:32.369
I'll just...

23:32.370 --> 23:33.997
No. Because then every time

23:34.080 --> 23:35.874
you look back on your wedding day,

23:35.957 --> 23:37.374
it's gonna be with pain and regret.

23:37.375 --> 23:38.696
And I can't allow that to happen.

23:39.419 --> 23:41.796
(SIGHS) I love you, sweetie.

23:42.923 --> 23:43.924
Oh.

23:44.007 --> 23:47.677
Ciao, baby. Just consider this
my wedding present, okay?

23:48.261 --> 23:51.264
Oh, God, help your father
before he blows his bypass.

23:52.015 --> 23:53.308
Pop, I got it.

23:53.892 --> 23:55.185
(GRUNTS)

23:57.312 --> 23:58.396
BEBE: That's it.

23:59.397 --> 24:02.400
There. You be brave, and elegant.

24:02.859 --> 24:06.071
Okay? Don't take shit
from any of the old people.

24:06.738 --> 24:08.740
Bebe. Bebe!

24:09.074 --> 24:10.407
Please, you don't have to do this.

24:10.408 --> 24:11.408
Oh, pishposh.

24:11.409 --> 24:14.746
I'm gonna go to The Plaza,
use Donald's platinum card.

24:14.829 --> 24:17.123
Listen. Look, I need you this weekend.

24:17.207 --> 24:19.209
I can't get through this without you.
I can't...

24:19.292 --> 24:21.878
Back off, Donald. You're
already on thin ice.

24:21.962 --> 24:23.254
What the hell did I do?

24:24.673 --> 24:26.257
It's not what you did.

24:26.341 --> 24:28.425
Okay. Okay, what didn't I do?

24:28.426 --> 24:30.053
Why don't you ask your wife?

24:30.136 --> 24:31.376
Maybe she'll explain it to you.

24:31.429 --> 24:32.806
(ENGINE STARTING)
- Bebe.

24:32.889 --> 24:34.349
DON: - My fault.
- Yep.

24:34.432 --> 24:37.435
My fault! Un-fucking-believable.

24:38.853 --> 24:41.648
Piece of wedding advice, kid,
stay single as long as you can.

24:42.440 --> 24:43.900
- Will do.
- Trust me.

24:44.275 --> 24:46.444
As long as you possibly can.

24:46.528 --> 24:48.445
ELLIE: Hey, I'm sorry,
but may I just say something here?

24:48.446 --> 24:50.448
The woman that you
supposedly love is devastated,

24:50.490 --> 24:52.826
and all you've got, Don, is "stay single."

24:52.909 --> 24:53.994
it was a joke.

24:54.077 --> 24:56.453
Right, I forgot,
you haven't laughed since the '60s.

24:56.454 --> 24:57.831
Yeah. Not since I married you.

24:57.914 --> 24:59.749
Yeah, well, promise to never do that again.

24:59.833 --> 25:01.458
Oh, believe me, not in a million years.

25:01.459 --> 25:03.086
Well, but let's not bring
your mother into this.

25:03.169 --> 25:04.212
Um, guys.

25:05.213 --> 25:06.464
- Ki-yai!
(GRUNTS)

25:07.924 --> 25:09.759
You just punched me in the face!
What are you doing?

25:09.843 --> 25:11.469
I could tell you something,
I earned my green belt,

25:11.511 --> 25:14.180
and you talk shit
about my mother again, I swear, Don...

25:14.264 --> 25:15.348
- Guys!
ELLIE: - What?

25:16.307 --> 25:18.027
I thought she wasn't coming until tomorrow.

25:18.059 --> 25:19.227
That was yesterday. For God's sake.

25:19.310 --> 25:21.646
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

25:21.730 --> 25:23.189
You just punched me in the fucking face.

25:23.273 --> 25:24.394
I'm sorry. Here we go, dear.

25:25.692 --> 25:26.693
What are you doing?

25:26.776 --> 25:27.819
What do you mean, what am I doing?

25:27.902 --> 25:29.612
I don't know. After what you just did?

25:29.696 --> 25:31.489
- You're gonna hold my hand.
- It's okay.

Oh...

25:44.085 --> 25:46.046
(CONTINUES SPEAKING SPANISH)

25:46.421 --> 25:48.590
I pray that Alejandro and Melissa

25:48.673 --> 25:51.508

26:24.250 --> 26:25.543
Anyway.

26:27.337 --> 26:28.922
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

26:29.547 --> 26:32.175
Oh, she wants to know
why your nose is bleeding.

Oh, this? Well, no, it's...
No English, right?

No.

26:36.554 --> 26:37.639
(LAUGHING)

26:37.722 --> 26:40.642

one of the great cunts of the 19th century.

Hi. Hello.

27:05.500 --> 27:07.001
This is my sister Lyla.

- Hi.
- And this is Jared.

Yes.

27:17.470 --> 27:19.055
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

27:20.223 --> 27:23.726
She said my son is lucky
to have such role models.

27:23.810 --> 27:25.937
Aww, we're your role models.

27:26.020 --> 27:27.522
That's a mistranslation.

27:27.605 --> 27:29.606
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is. This is Nuria.

27:29.607 --> 27:30.984
Hi.

27:31.067 --> 27:32.610
Hey. Really nice to meet you.

Excuse me. Sorry.

27:38.700 --> 27:43.621
Sorry. It's not...
We're in between interior decorators.

27:43.788 --> 27:45.832
Yes, and there's a statue, too.

And oh, my goodness,
I have such wonderful taste.

27:48.251 --> 27:49.961
DON: Yeah.
ELLIE: Don, darling.

27:50.044 --> 27:51.628
I think it would be a wonderful idea

27:51.629 --> 27:54.299
if you showed her your studio, dear.

27:54.382 --> 27:55.633
I don't think that's such a good idea.

27:55.675 --> 27:58.636
Hey, you know,
I think that's a really good idea.

27:59.512 --> 28:01.113

Yeah. And a mother.

28:37.759 --> 28:38.801
Are you jealous?

ELLIE: Don't be ridiculous.

28:40.011 --> 28:43.264
I mean, it's just,
I never thought I'd actually meet her.

You really think
you and Dad can pull this off?

Oh, um, she was wondering why the wedding

39:51.807 --> 39:53.349
is being held at our house,

39:53.350 --> 39:55.561
and not at the O'Connors'.

39:56.687 --> 39:57.688
Um...

39:58.230 --> 40:02.568
Well, we thought we'd shake it up a little.

Uh, besides, our house...

that your house is the most

40:31.388 --> 40:33.389
amazing place that I have ever seen.

40:33.390 --> 40:34.808
You built it yourselves, yes?

40:34.892 --> 40:36.143
(THUDDING)

40:36.393 --> 40:37.436
We did, actually.

40:37.519 --> 40:38.812
Tell her the story.

40:39.188 --> 40:40.549
MISSY: Yeah, it's really romantic.

40:40.856 --> 40:42.983
It is. It is romantic.

40:43.067 --> 40:45.401
It's fine. Tell her. Tell the story.

40:45.402 --> 40:48.405
Don and I, we were living
in the city separately.

40:48.864 --> 40:50.282
She wouldn't shack up with me

40:50.366 --> 40:51.646
because we weren't in matrimony.

40:51.700 --> 40:53.744
ELLIE: So Don's latest exhibition

40:53.827 --> 40:55.120
had sold out completely.

40:55.204 --> 40:56.412
Third in a row.

40:56.413 --> 40:58.499
It did well. Awash in humility. As always.

40:58.582 --> 40:59.833
One of the many things she loves about me.

40:59.917 --> 41:00.918
That's our Donny. Yes.

41:01.001 --> 41:03.379
Can we please just skip
to the happy ending?

41:03.420 --> 41:04.420
(SPITS)

41:04.421 --> 41:05.422
ELLIE: So Don and I,

41:05.464 --> 41:07.383
we decided we'd take a
drive to the country,

41:07.424 --> 41:09.510
and we came to this open field. Remember?

41:09.593 --> 41:11.053
We parked there, we went for a walk.

41:11.136 --> 41:12.805
And it was so wonderful.

41:12.888 --> 41:13.931
It was sunset.

41:14.014 --> 41:16.016
Do you remember that, Don? Sweet.

41:16.100 --> 41:19.269
And we came across this gorgeous pond.

41:20.062 --> 41:23.983
And he proposed to me
as the sun kind of went down.

41:24.066 --> 41:27.361
DON: I was...
I was sneaking out here on Saturday

41:27.444 --> 41:28.821
while she was
spending time with her folks, and...

41:28.904 --> 41:30.446
Yeah, but I knew what you were up to.

41:30.447 --> 41:31.532
Believe me, I knew what he was up to.

41:31.615 --> 41:32.783
- Oh, you?
- I did.

41:32.866 --> 41:33.993
You didn't have a clue.

41:34.076 --> 41:35.619
- What are you talking about?
- You were clueless.

41:35.703 --> 41:36.704
He spent three months

41:36.787 --> 41:38.163
searching the entire New
England countryside

41:38.247 --> 41:39.455
for the most beautiful spot,

41:39.456 --> 41:41.257
and when he found it,
he took her back there.

41:41.291 --> 41:42.459
And then when he proposed...

41:43.002 --> 41:44.003
He planted...

41:44.086 --> 41:45.671
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

41:49.633 --> 41:50.843
And then they built a house over the years

41:50.926 --> 41:53.469
under the shade of the
tree, and added on to it

41:53.470 --> 41:57.725
every time Don
sold another sculpture, until, well...

41:57.808 --> 41:59.852
(MADONNA SPEAKING SPANISH)

42:01.186 --> 42:03.814
You are very lucky to find a man like that.

42:04.231 --> 42:05.482
Oh, yes, of course.

42:05.524 --> 42:07.317
I'm just... I'm terribly lucky.

42:07.401 --> 42:09.236
Thank you. Thank you.

42:09.945 --> 42:11.363
ELLIE: Uh, Yvette?

42:11.822 --> 42:14.199
Will you please excuse me, just for...

42:15.743 --> 42:17.077
- Jared!
(CUTLERY CLATTERS)

42:17.161 --> 42:18.494
May I please speak with you?

42:18.495 --> 42:19.496
Yeah, sure.

42:20.122 --> 42:22.374
You know what? I got...
Give me, like, one sec.

42:22.458 --> 42:24.460
I got, like, a terrible leg cramp.

42:24.501 --> 42:26.253
ELLIE: Uh-huh. Nuria, dear. Please. Yes.

42:26.336 --> 42:27.503
Please. May I take you to the restroom,

42:27.504 --> 42:28.547
please, the ladies' room?

42:28.630 --> 42:30.549
Where we can wash your beautiful hands.

42:31.258 --> 42:32.968
BARRY: Well, (CLEARS THROAT)

42:34.386 --> 42:36.930
here's to a wonderful dinner.

42:37.389 --> 42:40.809
And a really

42:40.893 --> 42:41.894
- neat wedding.
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

42:41.977 --> 42:43.520
- Huh? Okay.
- Indeed.

42:44.438 --> 42:45.481
ALEJANDRO: Cheers.

42:50.360 --> 42:51.403
(SPLASHING)

42:56.158 --> 42:57.409
BARRY: Madonna,

42:57.493 --> 42:59.536
how is your bisque?

43:00.329 --> 43:01.413
Huh?

43:05.834 --> 43:07.503
(RAIN POURING)

43:08.545 --> 43:10.547
Oh, for Pete's sake.

43:18.055 --> 43:19.264
Oh, my God.

43:19.348 --> 43:21.058
So, the thing to remember
is that men are like pumpkins,

43:21.141 --> 43:22.351
the good ones are either taken

43:22.434 --> 43:23.477
or they've had everything scraped

43:23.560 --> 43:24.560
out of their heads with a spoon.

43:24.561 --> 43:26.562
MUFFIN: I'm melting! Oh, my God!

43:26.563 --> 43:27.731
- My face!
- What's happened?

43:27.815 --> 43:29.942
What's happening in here?

43:30.025 --> 43:32.945
Well, Nuria and I
have become very close friends.

43:33.028 --> 43:35.572
Yes. She was just explaining to me.

43:36.448 --> 43:37.699
- Really?
BOTH: - Mmm-hmm.

43:41.662 --> 43:43.038
Wish I had been adopted.

43:43.705 --> 43:45.332
Can we please just elope now?

43:45.582 --> 43:47.876
Seems like the lesser
of two evils at this point.

43:48.335 --> 43:50.712
Really? Because I'm pretty sure
Vegas is just back that way.

43:50.796 --> 43:52.796
I'm pretty sure that you
wouldn't survive the trip.

43:53.006 --> 43:55.467
- What the hell is going on with your family?
- Why?

43:57.970 --> 43:59.096
Oh.

43:59.179 --> 44:03.142
My kingdom, my kingdom,
my kingdom for a steakhouse.

44:03.225 --> 44:04.393
(CHUCKLES)

44:04.810 --> 44:06.353
DON: What a bust that was.

44:08.105 --> 44:09.606
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

44:12.025 --> 44:13.152
What are you grinning at?

44:13.235 --> 44:15.863
(GIGGLES) Oh, it's just women's lib.

44:16.613 --> 44:18.614
You know something, I'm cold.

44:18.615 --> 44:20.117
Are you sure that heat's all the way up?

44:20.200 --> 44:22.619
Well, yeah. We'll take a steam
when we get back to the house.

44:22.703 --> 44:24.496
Wait a minute,
you have a steam in the guest room?

44:24.580 --> 44:25.747
Nope. The master bedroom.

44:26.123 --> 44:27.624
(LAUGHS MOCKINGLY)

44:27.666 --> 44:28.667
Whatever you say.

44:28.750 --> 44:30.626
AUTOMATED VOICE: <i>You have no new messages in your mailbox.</i>

44:30.627 --> 44:32.796
Ridiculous. It's like I ceased to exist.

44:32.880 --> 44:34.464
What's that, Lyla?

44:34.548 --> 44:37.009
No texts, no calls. Nothing.

44:38.635 --> 44:39.636
<i>Hombres.</i>

44:39.720 --> 44:40.846
I know, right?

44:41.180 --> 44:42.638
ELLIE: No offense, Lyla, but honestly.

44:42.639 --> 44:44.516
Really, you did leave him.

44:44.600 --> 44:46.643
Yeah, he doesn't have
to make it so easy for me.

44:47.936 --> 44:49.396
You think he'll show up at the wedding?

44:49.479 --> 44:50.772
He does, I'll tell him
to fuck the fuck off.

44:50.856 --> 44:52.399
- Language.
ELLIE: - Oh, Lyla.

44:52.482 --> 44:54.568
He said terrible things to me.

44:54.651 --> 44:56.695
- Punch him in the nose?
- Of course not.

44:56.778 --> 44:58.572
Because that would be unladylike.

44:59.281 --> 45:00.866
What are you looking at me for?

45:03.911 --> 45:04.953
You miss him.

45:07.414 --> 45:08.582
A little.

45:08.665 --> 45:11.335
That's what I thought.
Look, just give him a call.

45:11.960 --> 45:13.128
I can't.

45:32.522 --> 45:34.733
So, I was thinking
we could maybe go to my room,

45:34.816 --> 45:37.778
listen to some music, or you know...

45:38.695 --> 45:39.696
Whatever.

45:40.530 --> 45:41.573
No, thank you.

45:41.823 --> 45:44.701
But you may read me
some poetry, if you wish.

45:45.661 --> 45:46.662
Poetry?

45:46.912 --> 45:47.913
Yes.

45:48.705 --> 45:49.705
Are you serious?

45:49.706 --> 45:51.833
Yes. Your mother was very informative.

45:52.125 --> 45:54.711
I deserve to be treated with respect.

45:58.215 --> 45:59.633
Don't we all.

45:59.716 --> 46:00.716
MISSY: Say it louder.

46:00.717 --> 46:02.237
ALEJANDRO: I'm an idiot.
MISSY: A what?

46:02.261 --> 46:06.431
I'm a galactic idiot.
My idiocracy knows no bounds.

46:06.515 --> 46:10.310
You won't tell a tiny white lie to a priest
that you'll never see again,

46:10.394 --> 46:12.562
but make a complete farce of our wedding?

46:12.646 --> 46:13.729
- I know.
- That's no problem?

46:13.730 --> 46:14.731
I know.

46:15.440 --> 46:17.234
I feel so bad for Bebe.

46:17.317 --> 46:19.903
You know how many months she and my
mom have been planning this.

46:19.987 --> 46:23.407
I know. I know. I'm an idiot.

46:28.287 --> 46:30.914
I did talk with Father Moinighan, though.

46:31.331 --> 46:32.666
For reals?

46:32.749 --> 46:34.751
I promised that little

46:34.793 --> 46:36.878
Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John

46:36.962 --> 46:40.257
would grow up ravenous
for the sweet baby Jesus.

46:40.340 --> 46:41.341
Did you?

46:42.467 --> 46:44.094
May have had crossies when I said it.

46:46.221 --> 46:47.556
Thank you.

46:48.098 --> 46:50.726
You really truly love me.

46:50.767 --> 46:51.768
I do.

46:52.894 --> 46:54.396
Yeah, you do.

46:58.608 --> 47:00.277
And you'll fix all the other stuff?

47:00.360 --> 47:01.778
What's it worth to you?

47:02.529 --> 47:03.572
Huh?

47:03.655 --> 47:05.115
You honestly think...

47:11.538 --> 47:14.791
It's too bad I'm saving
myself for marriage.

47:15.334 --> 47:16.752
I'll see you tomorrow.

47:17.794 --> 47:19.796
I'm busy tomorrow.

47:19.880 --> 47:22.799
MISSY: All I hear is, "Blah, blah, blah."

47:23.884 --> 47:25.886
ELLIE: So, you know, call her again.

47:25.969 --> 47:29.348
I tried, but she had the
front desk lock me out.

47:32.017 --> 47:33.769
Tell me again how this is my fault.

47:33.810 --> 47:34.810
Don.

47:34.811 --> 47:36.931
WOMAN: (ON TV)
<i>...in a year. Many of these children...</i>

47:36.938 --> 47:38.299
DON: Now, where'd you dig that up?

47:38.440 --> 47:40.400
Oh, my God, I can't
believe how tiny he was.

47:40.484 --> 47:41.485
Yeah.

47:42.152 --> 47:43.487
Sometimes I wonder

47:43.945 --> 47:45.155
if we did the right thing.

47:45.322 --> 47:47.115
Ellie, for two people
who did a lot of things wrong,

47:47.199 --> 47:48.742
adopting AI wasn't one of them.

47:48.825 --> 47:50.702
Yeah, he's the kindest of us all.

47:50.786 --> 47:51.787
Yeah.

47:51.828 --> 47:54.623
We didn't do that
many things that were wrong, did we?

47:55.582 --> 47:57.042
Everybody's happy now.

47:57.125 --> 47:58.293
- Well...
- Right?

47:58.377 --> 47:59.753
(STAMMERS) Yeah, right.

47:59.836 --> 48:02.297
Kids are great.
You're having nine-hour orgasms.

48:02.381 --> 48:03.965
Uh... (LAUGHS)

48:04.049 --> 48:05.850
No, no, no, just... Yeah,
well, give or take.

48:06.843 --> 48:08.845
- I'm intrigued.
- Yeah, I'm stunned.

48:08.929 --> 48:10.846
- Prove it.
- You wish.

48:10.847 --> 48:12.849
- For old time's sake.
- Oh, my God. Okay.

48:13.141 --> 48:15.602
You know what,
I think the coast must be clear by now.

48:15.685 --> 48:16.770
Ooh.

48:17.854 --> 48:18.855
Good to see you, Ell.

48:20.440 --> 48:21.983
I think you said that already.

48:25.862 --> 48:26.947
- What the hell?
- Oh!

48:27.030 --> 48:28.824
- Ow!
- What are you doing?

48:28.865 --> 48:29.866
Oh!

48:30.867 --> 48:33.495
Shoot. You're gonna
wake Madonna, for God's sake.

48:33.578 --> 48:34.579
Shh.

48:34.871 --> 48:35.871
Ow!

48:35.872 --> 48:38.667
I have been reading sonnets. Out loud.

48:38.750 --> 48:39.876
Well, that's very romantic.

48:39.918 --> 48:41.878
So romantic for you, dear. What?

48:42.879 --> 48:46.007
I am 29 years old, and
I've finally, I mean, I...

48:46.383 --> 48:47.384
What?

48:47.884 --> 48:49.885
I can't believe
I'm getting cock-blocked by my own mother.

48:49.886 --> 48:52.013
I merely told her that
there are certain things

48:52.097 --> 48:53.889
that women should expect from a man

48:53.890 --> 48:56.560
before she just
jumps into bed with him. All right?

48:57.227 --> 49:00.772
Yeah, I know.
Don't you think it's kind of hard to...

49:00.856 --> 49:01.857
What?

49:01.898 --> 49:03.378
Send her flowers every day for a year

49:03.400 --> 49:05.040
when she goes back to Colombia on Monday.

49:05.068 --> 49:06.069
<i>C'est la guerre.</i>

49:07.028 --> 49:08.780
(GASPS) Oh...

49:08.864 --> 49:09.906
So sorry.

49:10.323 --> 49:11.907
Oh, my goodness.
Well, anyway, good night, sweetheart.

49:11.908 --> 49:13.076
Sweet dreams, of course.

49:13.160 --> 49:14.161
- Yeah.
- Okay.

49:14.244 --> 49:15.911
You suck. <i>Buenas noches.</i>

49:15.912 --> 49:17.747
ELLIE: <i>Buenas noches.</i>

49:22.794 --> 49:24.087
(GASPS) Oh!

49:25.255 --> 49:26.715
<i>Noches.</i>

49:26.965 --> 49:28.133
<i>Noches</i> again.

49:29.926 --> 49:31.511
(EXHALING)

49:31.803 --> 49:34.055
Oh! Back so soon?

49:34.139 --> 49:37.225
Oh, yeah.
The temptation was more than I could stand.

49:37.309 --> 49:38.934
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

49:38.935 --> 49:40.312
Now you're talking.

49:41.354 --> 49:43.064
- Uh...
- Be gentle.

49:43.148 --> 49:45.066
(CHUCKLES)
- Or don't.

49:47.152 --> 49:48.361
Good night.

49:49.154 --> 49:51.573
- Good night? Says you.
- Yup.

49:51.656 --> 49:53.158
Oh, please. Come on, you
didn't really think

49:53.241 --> 49:55.243
that we'd go through with this, did you?

49:55.327 --> 49:56.828
No one ever died from dabbling.

49:56.912 --> 49:59.164
Uh-huh. Just our marriage.

49:59.247 --> 50:00.956
- Fair point.
- Yeah.

50:00.957 --> 50:03.293
But, you know,
I couldn't stand being ignored.

50:04.419 --> 50:05.879
I ignored you?

50:05.962 --> 50:09.508
You didn't need a soothsayer to know that
you were terrified of being alone with me.

50:09.591 --> 50:11.927
I'm sorry, Don. Really, lam.

50:11.968 --> 50:14.095
Just, you know, with the children gone,

50:14.971 --> 50:17.474
I guess I didn't think
we had much in common anymore.

50:17.557 --> 50:20.060
Yeah, so we picked up another kid
to avoid the issue.

50:21.978 --> 50:24.564
You know, I tried to stick it out.
I really did.

50:24.648 --> 50:25.982
I know you did, Don.

50:29.027 --> 50:30.195
Wanna fool around?

50:30.278 --> 50:31.821
(LAUGHS) Oh!

50:33.114 --> 50:35.450
You need to marry Bebe.

50:35.534 --> 50:37.869
And that's nothing you don't already know.

50:38.578 --> 50:40.996
And what about you?
Anybody special since...

50:40.997 --> 50:41.997
Me?

50:41.998 --> 50:42.998
Yeah, of course.

50:42.999 --> 50:44.167
There have been guys here and there.

50:44.251 --> 50:47.504
Yeah. And I guess nothing
I'd write home about,

50:47.587 --> 50:48.964
nothing special.

50:49.297 --> 50:51.258
Well, I did date this local cop

50:51.341 --> 50:52.384
when I lived over on Courtesy.

50:52.467 --> 50:54.261
He was really quite nice.

50:54.803 --> 50:57.055
And then in New York City
I met this stock broker

50:57.138 --> 50:59.349
who actually proposed to me
on the third date.

50:59.432 --> 51:02.352
You know, that should have
been my first clue. God.

01:03:34.937 --> 01:03:35.980
And what are you gonna do?

01:03:36.063 --> 01:03:37.773

to serve your revenge cold, don't you?

DON: Come on, honey.

01:04:02.757 --> 01:04:04.884
- All right, I forgive you.
- You do?

01:04:04.967 --> 01:04:05.968
Well, I mean, of course.

01:04:06.052 --> 01:04:07.553

No. No.

Yeah, I didn't think so.

- Sorry.
- That's okay.

the symmetry of it.

Although, I guess
if we were really being sticklers,

01:04:39.001 --> 01:04:40.835
you'd have to put your dick in Muffin.

01:04:40.836 --> 01:04:41.836
ELLIE: What?

01:04:41.837 --> 01:04:43.422
I dig the vulgarity,

01:04:43.506 --> 01:04:45.925
but why would I ever want
to bang Muffin O'Connor?

01:04:46.008 --> 01:04:48.844
Well, I'm just saying,
if you want to go for true symmetry.

punch me in the face again?

What are we talking about?

Well, there was... It was like a...

DON: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:05:12.243 --> 01:05:16.871
If making it even
means that I'm supposed to boink Muffin,

01:05:16.872 --> 01:05:19.875
that would mean that you boinked...

No, no, no. Not today.

It was years ago, when we were married.

He must have read you a ton of poetry, huh?

01:05:40.104 --> 01:05:41.313
How could you?

01:05:41.397 --> 01:05:43.065
I was really very unhappy at that time.

01:05:43.149 --> 01:05:44.233
- What about me?

Listen, I don't know what to say.

01:05:47.278 --> 01:05:48.654
It was practically an accident.

01:05:48.737 --> 01:05:51.115
And I never told anyone.
Never. Not one person.

01:06:04.962 --> 01:06:06.839
bumping uglies with Muffin O'Connor.

What the hell did you just say?

01:06:08.924 --> 01:06:10.301
Just because you porked my wife

01:06:10.384 --> 01:06:11.844
doesn't mean I have to return the favor.

Okay, so I did the thing with you.
I mean, I didn't do that.

So you're the one.

01:06:36.535 --> 01:06:37.870
And I'm so sorry, Muffin.

01:06:37.953 --> 01:06:39.205
You have to understand

01:06:39.288 --> 01:06:41.248
that it didn't mean one single thing.

01:06:41.332 --> 01:06:43.167

and he doesn't harp on my fetishes.

01:11:44.092 --> 01:11:46.386
Oh, yeah, okay, so he was flirting,

01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:47.930
but I made the first move.

01:11:48.764 --> 01:11:50.808
- Why?
- Because...

01:11:52.100 --> 01:11:54.353
I wanted to make sure I was over him.

01:11:54.436 --> 01:11:56.313
And you know what? it turns out

01:11:56.396 --> 01:11:59.274
I've been over him for such a long time.

01:12:01.276 --> 01:12:03.278
I want you to know something else.

01:12:03.862 --> 01:12:05.697
I've always been happy

01:12:06.281 --> 01:12:09.076
that it was you he turned to.

01:12:11.662 --> 01:12:13.288
I told you I forgive you.

01:12:13.330 --> 01:12:14.832
Then forgive him, too.

(JARED AND NURIA MOANING)

01:12:19.711 --> 01:12:21.213
JARED: Oh, my God!

01:12:23.298 --> 01:12:24.383
Oh, my God.

01:12:25.342 --> 01:12:26.552
Again.

01:12:26.927 --> 01:12:28.178
Oh, hell yeah.

01:12:30.305 --> 01:12:31.305
Ah!

01:12:31.306 --> 01:12:33.308
MAN: - Excuse me...
- No, thank you.

01:12:36.895 --> 01:12:38.564
At least no one will ever forget it.

01:12:38.772 --> 01:12:39.773
I'm an orphan.

01:12:39.857 --> 01:12:41.400
No, no. It's not that bad.

01:12:41.483 --> 01:12:45.320
My mother's a lesbian, and my father
has had his penis in your mom.

01:12:45.988 --> 01:12:47.406
Ugh! That's a picture.

01:12:47.698 --> 01:12:49.449
If it makes you feel any better,
I think my brother

01:12:49.533 --> 01:12:50.993
is somewhere having sex with my sister.

01:12:51.076 --> 01:12:52.077
What?

01:12:52.661 --> 01:12:54.329
They are all coming out of the woodwork.

01:13:00.335 --> 01:13:02.004
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.

01:13:03.338 --> 01:13:07.926
No. No, I'm just saying call me
if she gets back to the hotel.

01:13:08.343 --> 01:13:11.763
Well, how the hell...
Listen, how am I supposed to know?

01:13:11.847 --> 01:13:13.348
That's why I'm asking you.

01:13:13.557 --> 01:13:14.600
Ow!

01:13:15.392 --> 01:13:18.145
And that makes a full set.
What the hell did I do now?

01:13:18.228 --> 01:13:20.354
Do you know why I've
stayed away from you for all these years?

01:13:20.355 --> 01:13:22.399
I have some idea. But I... Okay.

01:13:22.482 --> 01:13:25.485
Because like it or not, I'm your daughter.

01:13:25.694 --> 01:13:26.904
Jared got all of Mom's traits,

01:13:26.987 --> 01:13:28.906
and I won the lottery with all of yours.

01:13:29.364 --> 01:13:31.365
Yeah. You know, if we're the same,

01:13:31.366 --> 01:13:34.368
how come no one's
popping you in the face every five minutes?

01:13:34.369 --> 01:13:35.370
Huh?

01:13:36.371 --> 01:13:37.706
You know, when you cheated on Mom

01:13:38.081 --> 01:13:41.001
I became terrified that I was gonna
ruin my marriage the same way.

01:13:41.919 --> 01:13:43.253
And I don't want to be like that.

01:13:43.337 --> 01:13:45.380
I don't want to be like you anymore.

01:13:46.048 --> 01:13:48.300
- Andrew's here.
- Yeah, I know, Dad.

01:13:48.634 --> 01:13:50.135
I wonder who called him?

01:13:51.637 --> 01:13:52.638
Yeah, okay, two things.

01:13:52.721 --> 01:13:55.349
Then if you never speak
to me again, so be it.

01:13:56.183 --> 01:14:00.520
Look. I know you would figure out that
I called him.

01:14:01.188 --> 01:14:02.981
And you're right, Lyla, we are alike.

01:14:03.065 --> 01:14:05.399
Neither of us are particularly close
to being stupid.

01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:06.818
And you know what, you can hate me

01:14:06.902 --> 01:14:08.695
for the rest of your life,
if that's what you need.

01:14:08.779 --> 01:14:10.614
But I'm gonna tell you
what I need as your father.

01:14:10.697 --> 01:14:12.157
I need as your father

01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:13.575
to be able to give my little girl

01:14:13.659 --> 01:14:15.410
the best chance at a happy life.

01:14:15.494 --> 01:14:19.413
Because ultimately, and we're all selfish,
that gives me the best chance at a happy life.

01:14:19.414 --> 01:14:20.874
Even if you hate me for it.

01:14:20.958 --> 01:14:22.358
- I don't hate you.
- Let me finish.

01:14:22.417 --> 01:14:24.044
Let me finish.

01:14:24.127 --> 01:14:26.420
I know you love me,
sweetheart, even if you don't.

01:14:26.421 --> 01:14:27.714
I do know that.

01:14:27.798 --> 01:14:30.838
And I know that when Mom and I split up
you felt that you had to pick a side.

01:14:30.842 --> 01:14:32.177
And I was okay with that.

01:14:32.260 --> 01:14:34.262
Because, you know,
she needed you more than I did.

01:14:34.346 --> 01:14:35.555
And I understand that.

01:14:37.808 --> 01:14:39.226
(SIGHS)

01:14:39.768 --> 01:14:44.439
The day you were born,
I went out and I got blasted,

01:14:45.190 --> 01:14:49.486
and I left your mom alone.
I just drank my face off.

01:14:52.030 --> 01:14:54.448
You know, you had these
swollen little eyes,

01:14:54.449 --> 01:14:56.451
and these pink little hands.

01:15:00.455 --> 01:15:01.915
You were so...

01:15:02.457 --> 01:15:05.627
I couldn't rectify how something

01:15:08.005 --> 01:15:11.466
so incandescent could come
from an old douchebag like me.

01:15:12.092 --> 01:15:13.093
Same with the boys.

01:15:13.176 --> 01:15:15.017
You know, but for a few
mistakes along the way,

01:15:15.053 --> 01:15:18.015
I did the best I could
to earn my place in all of your lives.

01:15:19.224 --> 01:15:21.025
You know, you can
be mad at me, not mad at me.

01:15:21.184 --> 01:15:24.104
It's never gonna change
how I feel about you.

01:15:25.063 --> 01:15:27.983
And, look, I know these are
just words to you now.

01:15:28.483 --> 01:15:29.818
But trust me, you'll understand what I mean

01:15:29.901 --> 01:15:31.528
when your daughter is born.

01:15:37.492 --> 01:15:39.202
How do you know it's a girl?

01:15:40.746 --> 01:15:44.041
I don't. I'm just hoping
you'll be that lucky.

01:16:01.099 --> 01:16:03.310
And I'm sorry that I'm so late, by the way.

01:16:03.393 --> 01:16:05.228
I actually wasn't planning on coming.

01:16:05.312 --> 01:16:06.313
You didn't miss much.

01:16:06.396 --> 01:16:08.356
My mom's a part-time lesbian.

01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:11.860

a response for that.

Hey.

01:16:20.744 --> 01:16:21.912
You look beautiful, honey.

01:16:21.995 --> 01:16:23.580
I'm not the one who invited you.

01:16:24.247 --> 01:16:28.543
Okay. He said that
you had something to tell me.

01:16:28.752 --> 01:16:29.753
We're just gonna go.

No, no, no, no, no.

01:16:31.546 --> 01:16:33.924
You are my sister now.
This involves you as well.

01:16:35.217 --> 01:16:36.468
You never called me.

01:16:37.552 --> 01:16:40.347
Well, you did say that
you never wanted to speak to me again.

01:16:41.139 --> 01:16:42.766
You said terrible things to me.

01:16:43.850 --> 01:16:44.851

I'm sorry. I am sorry.

01:16:53.568 --> 01:16:54.736
I'm pregnant.

01:16:55.737 --> 01:16:57.572

into an unhappy marriage.

Well, okay. We're all listening.

it's that it's all but a dream.

which means, as far as I can see,

01:18:12.939 --> 01:18:14.816
the only real use in loving someone

01:18:15.650 --> 01:18:17.194
is that it makes your life better.

01:18:17.277 --> 01:18:20.071

without you in it.

No, no, I did not ask you a question.
