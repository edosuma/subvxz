13:49.567 --> 13:52.396
I thought I did something wrong
the last time.

13:52.440 --> 13:54.964
Oh, no.Of course. Oh, you know how much

13:55.008 --> 13:56.139
I love this girl.

13:56.183 --> 13:57.271
GARRETT: I really
appreciate it.

13:57.314 --> 13:59.490
Where is your friend?

13:59.534 --> 14:02.537
Uh...

14:02.580 --> 14:04.756
I don't know.

14:04.800 --> 14:07.890
Hey, I-I'm gonna go, uh,
bring out her stuff to you,

14:07.934 --> 14:09.457
and I'll be...
I'll be right back.

14:09.500 --> 14:11.502
♪

15:41.375 --> 15:43.377
♪

15:45.988 --> 15:47.033
Hey, Pop.

15:47.076 --> 15:48.599
Hey, Dante.

15:48.643 --> 15:50.123
How was your birthday?It was good.

15:50.166 --> 15:51.472
It was good.

15:51.515 --> 15:53.256
That little bonus
you slipped into my locker,

15:53.300 --> 15:55.041
that was really nice of you
to remember.

15:55.084 --> 15:58.044
Get yourself something nice.

15:58.087 --> 16:00.220
I remember 40.
It hit you yet?

16:00.263 --> 16:03.049
Yeah, I think it's
hitting me pretty good.

16:03.092 --> 16:04.702
I feel like...

16:06.356 --> 16:09.229
Everything just feels
really heavy all of a sudden.

16:09.272 --> 16:10.708
You know?
I do know.

16:10.752 --> 16:12.667
And I don't want it
to be like that.

16:12.710 --> 16:14.321
You ever feel like...

16:14.364 --> 16:17.106
like you're carrying
all these things in your life?

16:17.150 --> 16:20.283
Like... like you're
carrying them...

16:22.024 --> 16:23.765
...like they're resentments?

16:25.593 --> 16:27.290
I definitely understand.

16:27.334 --> 16:29.814
I'm sorry, Pop.

16:29.858 --> 16:32.600
You're always so good at
talking to us about our lives.

16:32.643 --> 16:34.080
Come on, Dante.

16:34.123 --> 16:36.125
You can talk to me anytime.
I'm honored.

16:36.169 --> 16:40.042
I'm just saying my wife
and my son and my father...

16:40.086 --> 16:42.001
My dad moved in
with his dog, you know,

16:42.044 --> 16:44.003
after my mom died.I do remember that.

16:44.046 --> 16:46.788
And they're the best things
in my life, and...

16:46.831 --> 16:48.746
I don't want to resent them.

16:48.790 --> 16:52.272
Because the truth is,
it's not them, right?

16:52.315 --> 16:55.318
It's me. It's me.

16:55.362 --> 16:57.886
There's something going on
inside me that's making me

16:57.929 --> 17:01.063
see the world in a way
that I don't want to see it.

17:01.107 --> 17:02.717
How can I help?

17:02.760 --> 17:04.675
So, with all these
new people coming in,

17:04.719 --> 17:08.375
I was just wondering
if there was a way

17:08.418 --> 17:13.249
for me to move on towards...

17:16.209 --> 17:18.167
...something where
I can advance.

17:18.211 --> 17:20.213
You mean make more money?

17:20.256 --> 17:24.782
Yeah. That, but also...

17:24.826 --> 17:27.437
I never had, like,
a five

17:27.481 --> 17:30.614
Like, a path towards
being a foreman

17:30.658 --> 17:33.139
or a supervisor.

17:33.182 --> 17:36.403
And I'm not saying
I should be one now,

17:36.446 --> 17:40.668
but... I just mean a path.

17:42.322 --> 17:45.586
Well, um, things keep going
in the right direction,

17:45.629 --> 17:47.588
a foreman-type situation
might open up,

17:47.631 --> 17:48.937
uh, you know, pretty soon.

17:48.980 --> 17:51.331
For real?It'll be a few months.

17:51.374 --> 17:52.854
We're gonna need
to hit some marks,

17:52.897 --> 17:55.291
but, uh, yeah-- yeah, in
plates, matter of fact.

17:55.335 --> 17:57.163
I really appreciate that, Pop.

17:57.206 --> 17:58.468
Anything you need
in the meantime,

17:58.512 --> 17:59.817
don't hesitate,
all right?

18:01.254 --> 18:02.951
See this right here?

18:02.994 --> 18:04.692
This is what we're doing
out here today

18:04.735 --> 18:06.868
'cause of you.

18:06.911 --> 18:08.870
Oh, real mature.

18:08.913 --> 18:10.263
Last known address
seven years ago,

18:10.306 --> 18:11.742
but we're out here
today in the rain

18:11.786 --> 18:13.353
'cause you had to go
and be a hero.

18:13.396 --> 18:15.572
Good morning, sir.Good morning, Sir.

18:15.616 --> 18:18.227
Is your jail dry? If so,
you can lock me up right now.

18:19.750 --> 18:21.883
Years ago, this man
lived two houses down.

18:21.926 --> 18:24.103
His name is Grady Kovak.
Do you know him?

18:24.146 --> 18:25.191
Doesn't live there anymore.

18:25.234 --> 18:27.193
No, sir. We know.

18:27.236 --> 18:29.238
We're just checking to see
if you might've seen him.

18:29.282 --> 18:31.806
But he does come to stay
with that son of a bitch

18:31.849 --> 18:33.895
down there
every so often.

18:33.938 --> 18:35.766
"That son of a bitch"?Yeah.

18:35.810 --> 18:37.899
That, uh, shitty
brown roof, see?

18:37.942 --> 18:40.380
CHEWY: Oh, yeah. Uh, when was
the last time you saw him?

18:40.423 --> 18:42.382
Oh, I don't know.

18:42.425 --> 18:45.036
About three
weeks ago, yeah.

18:47.082 --> 18:48.779
That house over there?

18:49.911 --> 18:51.260
But be warned.

18:51.304 --> 18:53.175
He's a crotchety bastard.

18:53.219 --> 18:55.221
Thanks for the warning, sir.
We'll keep our eyes open.

18:55.264 --> 18:56.918
ROOK:
Have a good day.

18:59.747 --> 19:01.357
WALSH:
Hold on a minute.

19:01.401 --> 19:04.230
Should we do this? Or should
we talk to the chief first or...

19:06.710 --> 19:08.103
Well, I'll be damned.

19:08.147 --> 19:09.496
What?

19:09.539 --> 19:11.019
Mr. Walsh, right?

19:11.062 --> 19:13.500
Yeah, that's right.You work at Carl Steel?

19:13.543 --> 19:17.243
Well, I do
until my scratch-offs hit.

19:17.286 --> 19:19.245
Wh

19:19.288 --> 19:21.769
So you know him?Yeah, he stays

19:21.812 --> 19:23.945
on my couch sometimes
when he's in town.

19:23.988 --> 19:26.469
Mr. Kovak's blood was
confirmed as one of the seven.

19:27.514 --> 19:30.691
Oh, Jesus.

19:30.734 --> 19:33.259
Any, any idea
what happened to him?

19:33.302 --> 19:35.130
You didn't notice
he was missing?

19:35.174 --> 19:36.740
He's been "missing" for years.

19:36.784 --> 19:40.135
He's one of those--
what you call it-- nomadics.

19:40.179 --> 19:42.964
You know, Alaska, Texas, Oregon.

19:43.007 --> 19:44.357
You know, he's come back here

19:44.400 --> 19:45.793
from damn near everywhere
over the years.

19:45.836 --> 19:47.360
When was the last time
you saw him?

19:47.403 --> 19:51.233
Uh, I guess it had to be
that night before,

19:51.277 --> 19:52.669
you know, before the...

19:52.713 --> 19:54.280
shit hit the fan.

19:54.323 --> 19:56.238
He was on your couch
the night before the murders?

19:56.282 --> 19:58.545
Yeah.

19:58.588 --> 20:00.460
Did he tell you he was in town
with Rick Mitchell?

20:00.503 --> 20:03.680
Did he say he'd been staying
in Youngstown with Rick?

20:03.724 --> 20:05.508
We talk pussy and football.

20:05.552 --> 20:07.945
I don't know anything
about the guy's life.

20:07.989 --> 20:10.165
Well, where were you
the night of the murders?

20:10.209 --> 20:12.559
The French Riviera.

20:12.602 --> 20:14.996
I was here.
Where do yinz think I was?

20:15.039 --> 20:16.040
Were you alone?

20:17.477 --> 20:19.435
My wife was visiting
her mother. Why?

20:19.479 --> 20:21.089
CHEWY:
'Cause, far as we know,

20:21.132 --> 20:23.700
you're the last person
who saw Grady Kovak alive.

20:23.744 --> 20:25.746
He was gone
by the time I got up.

20:25.789 --> 20:29.053
Don't go anywhere. We're gonna
want to talk to you again.

20:45.809 --> 20:48.638
Oh, Ms. Ashworth.

20:48.682 --> 20:52.468
Oh, hello, um...

20:52.512 --> 20:54.209
Charles.

20:54.253 --> 20:56.080
Oh, Charles, of course.

20:56.124 --> 20:57.473
I'm so sorry.

20:57.517 --> 20:59.736
Don't apologize.

20:59.780 --> 21:03.653
I-I was hoping we could work
on your biography a little bit?

21:03.697 --> 21:06.177
Oh, you want to know about me?

21:06.221 --> 21:08.005
We've been
working on it every day.

21:08.049 --> 21:09.790
And yesterday,

21:09.833 --> 21:12.706
we left off where...

21:14.360 --> 21:16.231
...you were about to take over
your father's business.

21:16.275 --> 21:18.494
Oh. Oh, yes.

21:18.538 --> 21:20.931
Yes, I

21:20.975 --> 21:22.106
Hi.Ah!

21:22.150 --> 21:23.891
:
Cupcake.

21:23.934 --> 21:26.589
What a surprise.
This is Ms. Ashworth.

21:26.633 --> 21:28.417
Ms. Ashworth, this is
my daughter Chelsea.

21:28.461 --> 21:30.854
Oh, she's lovely.

21:30.898 --> 21:32.595
How long have you been married?

21:32.639 --> 21:34.380
Gross.

21:34.423 --> 21:38.819
We're gonna go to my room
and talk a bit.

21:38.862 --> 21:40.255
I'll come
and meet up with you later?

21:40.299 --> 21:41.952
Oh, okay.

21:41.996 --> 21:43.258
It's lovely to
meet you both.

21:43.302 --> 21:45.695
Really nice
to meet you.

21:48.568 --> 21:51.440
So what is that, Dad?

21:51.484 --> 21:54.095
Ah, it's just a little drill

21:54.138 --> 21:56.880
for us to help us
with our memories.

21:56.924 --> 21:59.100
Writing down our stories.

21:59.143 --> 22:02.843
:
Ms. Ashworth, she has...

22:02.886 --> 22:07.151
a little difficulty sometimes.

22:07.195 --> 22:10.459
You're making friends,
you're making girlfriends.

22:13.549 --> 22:16.987
That's good.
I'm proud of you, Dad.

22:27.737 --> 22:29.739
RICH:
Wyler.

22:31.828 --> 22:34.178
Wyler.

22:36.703 --> 22:39.227
Hey, Rich.

22:39.270 --> 22:41.229
What are you doing here?

22:41.272 --> 22:44.754
Chelsea, I came to see your dad.

22:44.798 --> 22:47.322
Oh, I thought you guys
hadn't spoken in years.

22:47.366 --> 22:50.064
I-I, uh, I heard he
wasn't doing so good,

22:50.107 --> 22:51.587
so I-I really thought
I should come see him.

22:51.631 --> 22:54.198
Yeah.Hey, Mr. Buchanan.

22:57.376 --> 22:59.421
CHELSEA:
I swore you out of my life.

22:59.465 --> 23:01.989
I swear to God, I wish
I would've just stuck to that.

23:02.032 --> 23:04.992
Honey. Cupcake...No, just

23:05.035 --> 23:07.298
Cut the shit right now.

23:07.342 --> 23:11.172
The conversation that we had
in here, about Mom,

23:11.215 --> 23:15.176
when you were pretending
that Uncle Rich was dead.

23:15.219 --> 23:17.744
RICH: What?That was part
of the grift.

23:17.787 --> 23:21.443
And the grift was on me.

23:21.487 --> 23:23.837
RICH:
No, Ch-Chel, come on, now.

23:23.880 --> 23:26.143
I would've brought you in,
but apparently I was dead.

23:26.187 --> 23:28.145
Honey, it wasn't on you.

23:28.189 --> 23:30.060
What's the con?It...

23:30.104 --> 23:32.672
Look, you're gonna
tell me the con,

23:32.715 --> 23:34.456
or I'm gonna go to the cops.

23:34.500 --> 23:36.284
M-Ms. Ashworth.

23:36.327 --> 23:37.677
Oh, Dad.

23:37.720 --> 23:39.896
Ms. Asworth
inherited a company.

23:39.940 --> 23:41.550
She made it profitable,
and then her sons

23:41.594 --> 23:44.248
took the company away from her,
forced her out.

23:44.292 --> 23:46.729
Then they put her in here
as soon as her mind

23:46.773 --> 23:49.471
started to go, but...

23:49.515 --> 23:55.085
she still has somewhere between
six and ten million dollars

23:55.129 --> 23:58.567
in Krugerrands
that she hid,

23:58.611 --> 24:04.051
but nobody knows where,
including her.

24:05.705 --> 24:08.534
That's why you refused
every place till we got here.

24:08.577 --> 24:11.537
Yeah. Yeah.Right.

24:11.580 --> 24:15.236
And that's what the memory
journaling was?

24:15.279 --> 24:17.499
Yeah.
Yeah.

24:17.543 --> 24:19.327
RICH:
I met her son.

24:19.370 --> 24:22.199
I was doing a stint
in a white-collar prison

24:22.243 --> 24:24.027
in Upstate New York.

24:24.071 --> 24:26.160
Said it's been bugging him
for years.

24:28.510 --> 24:31.644
Of course.

24:31.687 --> 24:34.124
RICH:
Of course. But...

24:41.305 --> 24:46.659
Hey, you remember, uh,
when you used to say

24:46.702 --> 24:51.141
that everything was leading
to the big score?

24:51.185 --> 24:54.362
You know, that everything
we were doing was just building,

24:54.405 --> 24:56.930
building and building
to the big one.

24:56.973 --> 25:00.411
And...

25:00.455 --> 25:03.980
and that we would be able
to just, like,

25:04.024 --> 25:06.679
hang it up one day and...

25:08.419 --> 25:13.729
...that we would move
to a foreign country together.

25:15.731 --> 25:18.081
You remember?

25:18.125 --> 25:21.215
Uh-huh.

25:24.523 --> 25:26.089
Look where you are, I mean,

25:26.133 --> 25:27.743
you're in fucking
Western Pennsylvania

25:27.787 --> 25:31.399
in a nursing home,
it's pretty...

25:31.442 --> 25:33.444
Petty fucking thieves.

25:51.201 --> 25:54.074
Pop.

25:54.117 --> 25:56.076
Hey.

25:56.119 --> 25:57.773
What are you doing here?

25:59.688 --> 26:02.604
WALMART: I don't suppose you
remember our conversation

26:02.648 --> 26:04.432
at the gas station?

26:04.475 --> 26:06.216
About maybe having a job for me?

26:06.260 --> 26:07.609
Really

26:07.653 --> 26:10.830
Well, it's not exactly
a "want to" situation,

26:10.873 --> 26:12.527
but...Oh. What,

26:12.571 --> 26:14.485
you got a woman now,
or something?Fuck no, man.

26:14.529 --> 26:16.923
There's enough weird shit on the
Internet, I don't need no woman.

26:18.794 --> 26:20.317
No, Chief Trask made it
pretty clear

26:20.361 --> 26:22.581
my previous occupation
is obsolete.

26:22.624 --> 26:25.366
We can find you a spot.Thanks, man.

26:25.409 --> 26:29.109
Hey. Full disclosure, though,
I'm just doing this shit

26:29.152 --> 26:30.980
till I can fake an injury
and get disability.

42:40.079 --> 42:42.385
"Every man I've ever known."

42:45.214 --> 42:47.042
You're gonna have to stay there.

42:53.919 --> 42:57.618
Well, why don't we start
with who are you?

42:58.750 --> 43:01.622
Randall Abatsy?

43:01.666 --> 43:03.711
Or...

43:03.755 --> 43:07.280
are you Ronald Israel Ealy?

43:07.323 --> 43:08.760
Or...

43:08.803 --> 43:12.764
August Ray Bellflower?

43:12.807 --> 43:16.028
Maybe you are
Antwuan Carlos Fraley.

43:16.071 --> 43:17.682
You gonna turn me in?

43:17.725 --> 43:20.206

43:20.249 --> 43:22.425
I'm not pissed
'cause you're

43:22.469 --> 43:24.384

43:24.427 --> 43:27.517
I'm pissed because you treated
me like the mark.

43:27.561 --> 43:30.477
And I told you that I'm not
the fucking mark.You're not the fucking mark.

43:32.740 --> 43:34.307
So my question is...

43:34.350 --> 43:35.438
I need you to stay down there.

43:35.482 --> 43:38.267
I already told you.

You know,
I couldn't figure out the con.

43:48.713 --> 43:51.933
Then I found your lease
for your Akron place.

43:51.977 --> 43:54.588
Under a different name,
of course.

43:54.632 --> 43:58.331
Just very lavish.

43:58.374 --> 44:01.377

44:03.945 --> 44:05.730
And, just...

44:05.773 --> 44:07.906
I don't know, it made me sad,
'cause they all lost.

44:10.256 --> 44:12.388
But I think I figured it out.

44:12.432 --> 44:14.434
What'd you figure out?

44:14.477 --> 44:15.957
So you set up shop
in two nearby towns.

44:16.001 --> 44:18.525
Right? You throw parties,

44:18.568 --> 44:21.659
you pretend to be
a rich investor.
Hey.

44:21.702 --> 44:25.663
I'm a very rich investor.Okay.

44:25.706 --> 44:27.665
You pick a risky stock
to go up in one,

44:27.708 --> 44:30.450
and the same stock to go down
in the other.

44:30.493 --> 44:34.280
The people whose money you've
lost, you just, you split town.

44:34.323 --> 44:36.848
But the people
who you've made money for,

44:36.891 --> 44:39.938
you get them to invest a lot
more in the next thing.

44:39.981 --> 44:42.854

with their money.

it was the difference

45:04.005 --> 45:05.920
but I-I never cared
about dinner.
