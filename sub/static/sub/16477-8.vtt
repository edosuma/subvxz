WEBVTT

00:04.338 --> 00:06.540
* Look at my watch,
look at my chain *

00:06.574 --> 00:07.408
* They're brand-new

00:07.441 --> 00:10.511
* Look at the wheels
on that thang *

00:10.544 --> 00:11.645
* They're brand-new

00:11.679 --> 00:12.646
* All these shoes...

00:12.680 --> 00:14.482
Okay, that's it.

00:14.515 --> 00:16.650
I have reached
my limit of hip-hop.

00:16.684 --> 00:18.319
No, no, no, don't
even think about it.

00:18.352 --> 00:20.421
You know Maddie only
falls asleep to that song.

00:20.454 --> 00:22.390
* Brand-new,
it's like I got a genie *

00:22.423 --> 00:23.524
* They gon' hate it when...

00:23.557 --> 00:25.059
(whispers):
She's already sleeping.

00:25.093 --> 00:26.694
(whispers):
Well, let's keep it that way.

00:26.727 --> 00:29.497
I blame you for this.
The books said to listen

00:29.530 --> 00:32.666
to classical music
during pregnancy, not rap.

00:32.700 --> 00:34.635
(thud)
What was that?

00:34.668 --> 00:35.836
(dashboard beeps)

00:35.869 --> 00:37.538
God, we got a flat.

00:37.571 --> 00:39.273
(Maddie fusses)

00:41.309 --> 00:43.677
Relax. Hey, relax.

00:43.711 --> 00:45.213
I'm a pro at changing tires.

00:45.246 --> 00:47.548
We'll be back on the road
before Maddie even notices.

00:47.581 --> 00:49.117
Hmm?

00:49.150 --> 00:50.684
(crying)

00:50.718 --> 00:52.686
(grunting)

00:52.720 --> 00:54.422
I know, sweetie. I'm tired, too.

00:54.455 --> 00:55.689
(crying continues)

00:55.723 --> 00:58.526
* Look at my watch, look at
my chains, they're brand-new *

00:58.559 --> 01:00.861
* Look at my clothes,
look at my shoes *

01:00.894 --> 01:03.164
* They're brand-new.
Really?

01:03.197 --> 01:05.699
(tires screeching in distance)

01:05.733 --> 01:07.701
Oh. Thank God.
That must be the tow truck.

01:07.735 --> 01:08.802
I'll get 'em.

01:08.836 --> 01:10.438
Shh-shh-shh-shh-shh.

01:10.471 --> 01:11.572
Hey!

01:11.605 --> 01:12.640
Over here.

01:12.673 --> 01:13.641
Hey!

01:13.674 --> 01:16.177
MARY: Keith! Look out!
Whoa!

01:16.210 --> 01:17.178
Keith!

01:19.480 --> 01:21.482
KEITH:
Honey?

01:21.515 --> 01:22.616
(vehicle crashing)

01:22.650 --> 01:24.618
(Maddie continues crying)

01:24.652 --> 01:26.654
*

02:03.624 --> 02:05.626
(sighs)

02:09.797 --> 02:11.732
(door closes in distance)

02:11.765 --> 02:15.436
(men talking quietly)

02:27.781 --> 02:29.750
Don't move!
Oh. Whoa.

02:29.783 --> 02:30.751
John?

02:30.784 --> 02:32.286
Rob?

02:32.320 --> 02:33.821
That was awesome. (laughs)

02:33.854 --> 02:36.657
I mean, that was like... that
looked like a cop-show entrance.

02:36.690 --> 02:38.759
Very Farrah Fawcett
in Charlie's Angels.

02:38.792 --> 02:39.760
I approve.

02:39.793 --> 02:40.961
(sighs):
Oh, God.

02:40.994 --> 02:42.796
Hey, Elle.
George, you
just missed it.

02:42.830 --> 02:43.897
Sis, go back out, do it again.

02:43.931 --> 02:45.799
What the hell is going on?

02:45.833 --> 02:47.335
What-what are you three
doing here?

02:47.368 --> 02:49.337
Surprising you
for Thanksgiving.

02:49.370 --> 02:50.804
You know I hate surprises.

02:50.838 --> 02:52.840
Uh, for the record,
I did send you a text.

02:52.873 --> 02:54.908
You sent me
three frowny-face emojis.

02:54.942 --> 02:56.710
Yeah.
You were in the NSA.

02:56.744 --> 02:58.212
You couldn't...
couldn't crack that code?

02:58.246 --> 03:00.381
GEORGE: I thought you'd
be happy to see us.

03:00.414 --> 03:02.616
You haven't been back home in
almost a year. We missed you.

03:02.650 --> 03:04.985
I-I am happy to see you.

03:05.018 --> 03:07.355
You just caught me

03:07.388 --> 03:09.690
a little off-guard.

03:09.723 --> 03:11.459
Ugh! Now give me hugs.

03:11.492 --> 03:12.760
(laughter)

03:12.793 --> 03:14.795
Oh!
Ah. Now, hold on.

03:14.828 --> 03:16.397
What?
Why are you so dressed up?

03:16.430 --> 03:18.266
And out past midnight?

03:18.299 --> 03:20.301
And... (sniffs) wearing perfume?

03:20.334 --> 03:21.469
(sniffing)

03:22.636 --> 03:23.837
That's Beach by Bobby Brown.

03:23.871 --> 03:26.006
You were on a date.

03:26.039 --> 03:28.309
What? No. I was...

03:28.342 --> 03:29.743
Eh! Deer-in-the-headlights look.

03:29.777 --> 03:30.911
Gives you away every time.

03:30.944 --> 03:32.646
Who is he?

03:32.680 --> 03:33.914
Just don't worry about it.

03:33.947 --> 03:36.650
We just want to make sure he's
not a deranged serial killer.

03:36.684 --> 03:38.319
Or a vegan.

03:38.352 --> 03:40.288
That would tear
this family apart, Elle.

03:40.321 --> 03:42.756
Okay, I am perfectly capable

03:42.790 --> 03:45.459
of judging someone's character
on my own, thank you.

03:45.493 --> 03:47.461
Plus, there's nothing
you'd uncover

03:47.495 --> 03:49.663
that an NCIS background
investigation hasn't already.

03:49.697 --> 03:51.965
So he's one of your coworkers.

03:51.999 --> 03:53.867
(sighs)

03:54.768 --> 03:56.437
(cell phone ringing)

04:00.641 --> 04:01.875
Hello.

04:01.909 --> 04:03.477
Where?

04:03.511 --> 04:04.812
Yeah. I'm on my way.

04:04.845 --> 04:06.314
That was my boss.

04:06.347 --> 04:07.315
I got to go.

04:07.348 --> 04:09.483
At this hour?
Mm-hmm.

04:09.517 --> 04:11.419
Job is 24/7.

04:11.452 --> 04:12.853
We will talk later.

04:12.886 --> 04:14.688
Don't touch anything.

04:14.722 --> 04:16.324
(sighs)

04:16.357 --> 04:19.927
So much easier when
we could just read her diary.

04:21.729 --> 04:23.864
All right, so we
have your numbers.

04:23.897 --> 04:25.733
Thanks. We'll be in touch.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.000
Okay.

04:29.437 --> 04:30.738
Well, glad you two
could make it.

04:30.771 --> 04:32.406
Well, someone took
a wrong turn.

04:32.440 --> 04:33.907
BISHOP:
Yeah, because someone was

04:33.941 --> 04:35.576
singing so loud, I
couldn't hear the navi.

04:35.609 --> 04:36.610
Oh.

04:36.644 --> 04:38.512
Nice threads. You on a date?

04:38.546 --> 04:40.614
What? No.
Yes.

04:41.649 --> 04:42.883
(laughs):
Well, not with her.

04:42.916 --> 04:44.452
No, we just carpooled.

04:44.485 --> 04:46.887
Right.
Fill us in.

04:46.920 --> 04:48.088
Yes. Solo driver was

04:48.121 --> 04:51.892
headed southbound when he
swerved off the road and crashed

04:51.925 --> 04:53.461
right into a boulder.

04:53.494 --> 04:54.762
Well, I don't see
any skid marks,

04:54.795 --> 04:57.030
so I don't think
the driver lost control.

04:57.064 --> 04:58.532
Mm.
Could have been deliberate.

04:58.566 --> 05:00.734
A little
Thelma and Louise action.

05:00.768 --> 05:01.835
Love that movie.

05:01.869 --> 05:03.771
Oh, what a surprise.

05:03.804 --> 05:05.038
(forced chuckle)

05:06.574 --> 05:08.442
BOTH:
What?

05:08.476 --> 05:10.678
(camera clicking)

05:10.711 --> 05:12.446
So Ranger Burt wants you to go

05:12.480 --> 05:14.482
to dinner with his parents.
What's the problem?

05:14.515 --> 05:17.084
(sighs)
It's not just any dinner, McGee.

05:17.117 --> 05:18.819
It's Thanksgiving dinner.

05:18.852 --> 05:20.688
That's like
the Super Bowl of meals.

05:20.721 --> 05:25.125
And it sends this message
that we're really serious.

05:25.158 --> 05:26.627
Well, aren't you?

05:26.660 --> 05:28.829
Yeah. No.

05:28.862 --> 05:30.998
Maybe. I don't like labels.

05:32.032 --> 05:33.801
Okay. What do we got?

05:33.834 --> 05:36.570
Well, boss, driver
of the car is

05:36.604 --> 05:38.972
Commander Derrick Reza,
45 years old.

05:39.006 --> 05:41.575
Works as a Navy chaplain out of

05:41.609 --> 05:44.812
the Armed Forces Interfaith
Association in Arlington.

05:44.845 --> 05:46.880
Did Duck give you a T.O.D.
before he took the body?

05:46.914 --> 05:48.582
That's the problem, boss.

05:48.616 --> 05:51.385
Duck's time of death
estimated as 7:00 p.m.

05:51.419 --> 05:52.820
But we've got
two witnesses stating

05:52.853 --> 05:55.556
that the accident happened
shortly after 11:00 p.m.

05:55.589 --> 05:57.891
So we have a guy
crashing his car

05:57.925 --> 06:00.428
after he was already dead
for four hours.

06:00.461 --> 06:01.161
How?

06:01.194 --> 06:03.997
With this.

06:04.031 --> 06:05.599
Clay brick?

06:05.633 --> 06:07.100
Oh, the masonry force

06:07.134 --> 06:08.936
is strong
within you, Gibbs.

06:08.969 --> 06:12.973
Yeah, so I found residue
of the clay on the gas pedal.

06:13.006 --> 06:16.944
Someone used this brick
to depress the gas pedal

06:16.977 --> 06:18.879
and send the commander crashing
through the guard rail

06:18.912 --> 06:20.047
and into that boulder.

06:20.080 --> 06:22.149
This was not an accident.

06:32.993 --> 06:34.928
(elevator bell dings)

06:34.962 --> 06:36.063
(phones ringing)

06:38.031 --> 06:39.933
Hi. Uh, can we
help you guys?

06:39.967 --> 06:41.001
We're waiting
for Agent Bishop.

06:41.034 --> 06:41.835
Yeah, uh,

06:41.869 --> 06:44.905
NCIS Special Agent
Eleanor Bishop.

06:44.938 --> 06:46.540
How cool does
that sound, right?

06:46.574 --> 06:48.676
Oh. And who
are you people?

06:48.709 --> 06:51.078
George, John, Robbie.

06:51.111 --> 06:52.012
We're Ellie's brothers.

06:52.045 --> 06:53.781
You guys must be
Tim and Alex.

06:53.814 --> 06:54.982
Yes, yes.
How you doing?

06:55.015 --> 06:56.149
Good to meet you guys.

06:56.183 --> 06:57.785
Bishop's talked
so much about you.

06:57.818 --> 06:59.553
It's good to put faces
to the names.

06:59.587 --> 07:02.923
Hmm. So, uh,
work with our sister?

07:02.956 --> 07:03.957
I do. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:03.991 --> 07:06.694
It's, uh, been just over
four years now, actually.

07:06.727 --> 07:08.228
I can't imagine this place
without her, you know.

07:08.261 --> 07:09.597
Ah. You guys hear that?

07:09.630 --> 07:11.031
BOTH:
Sure did.

07:11.064 --> 07:13.233
Sounds like you two
are pretty close.

07:13.266 --> 07:14.635
Maybe a little too close.

07:14.668 --> 07:15.903
Excuse me?

07:15.936 --> 07:18.038
Huh. This is getting
interesting.

07:18.071 --> 07:20.173
Uh, what are you doing?

07:20.207 --> 07:22.610
(chuckles) Getting to know
your coworkers.

07:22.643 --> 07:24.244
Is this the guy
you're dating?

07:24.277 --> 07:26.480
Seems like your type--
tall, brainy, aloof.

07:27.948 --> 07:29.917
How did you even
get in the building?

07:29.950 --> 07:31.218
Guest pass.

07:31.251 --> 07:32.185
We're getting a tour.

07:32.219 --> 07:33.787
Oh. Huh. Really?

07:33.821 --> 07:35.956
On-on whose authorization?
GIBBS: Mine.

07:37.925 --> 07:38.992
Give me an update.

07:39.026 --> 07:40.260
Boss, victim is

07:40.293 --> 07:41.962
Commander Derrick Reza.

07:41.995 --> 07:43.931
Unmarried, no children.

07:43.964 --> 07:45.799
His parents in New York
have been notified.

07:45.833 --> 07:47.568
Reza worked as an imam before
joining the Navy in 2003.

07:47.601 --> 07:48.969
He's one of a handful

07:49.002 --> 07:51.739
of Muslim chaplains
serving in the military.

07:51.772 --> 07:53.574
Besides being assigned
to the Armed Forces

07:53.607 --> 07:55.576
Interfaith Association,
Reza was a member

07:55.609 --> 07:57.645
of several charitable
organizations,

07:57.678 --> 08:00.681
so it's hard to imagine
he'd have any enemies.

08:00.714 --> 08:02.082
(crunching)

08:05.886 --> 08:06.887
Hmm?

08:06.920 --> 08:08.255
Oh. Sorry.

08:10.758 --> 08:12.693
Suspects?

08:12.726 --> 08:15.062
Well, according to Reza's
secretary, his last call was to

08:15.095 --> 08:16.029
a Ronald Ayers.

08:16.063 --> 08:17.698
He runs a
meditation center

08:17.731 --> 08:18.932
and Zen garden
out of Falls Church.

08:18.966 --> 08:20.300
Okay, check it out.

08:20.333 --> 08:21.602
Bishop, Quinn,

08:21.635 --> 08:22.970
get with
Commander Reza's supervisor

08:23.003 --> 08:24.872
and find out
who he was interacting with.

08:26.006 --> 08:28.208
Behave.

08:32.946 --> 08:34.715
(elevator bell dings)

08:34.748 --> 08:37.585
DUCKY: I'm aware that in Islam
it is believed

08:37.618 --> 08:41.722
that the deceased
can still feel pain.

08:41.755 --> 08:45.559
And that to break the bone
of a dead person

08:45.593 --> 08:47.961
is like breaking the bone
of a living one.

08:47.995 --> 08:49.196
(elevator bell dings)

08:49.229 --> 08:52.032
I do not wish
to add to your suffering.

08:52.065 --> 08:54.067
Hey. You solo today?

08:54.101 --> 08:56.136
Ah, 'tis the season.

08:56.169 --> 08:58.872
Mr. Palmer had an
unfortunate accident

08:58.906 --> 09:02.710
attempting to deep fry
a turkey, but he's okay.

09:02.743 --> 09:04.177
You got a cause
of death for me?

09:04.211 --> 09:05.713
I'm afraid not.

09:05.746 --> 09:06.714
Commander Reza's family

09:06.747 --> 09:08.348
requested that

09:08.381 --> 09:11.351
an autopsy not be performed
for religious reasons.

09:11.384 --> 09:13.086
Duck, this is a murder case.

09:13.120 --> 09:16.023
Jethro, this man
is a chaplain.

09:16.056 --> 09:17.658
I do not intend

09:17.691 --> 09:20.628
to go against his final
wishes if I can avoid it.

09:20.661 --> 09:22.329
Okay. So why'd you call me?

09:22.362 --> 09:27.000
Because my initial time
of death was correct.

09:27.034 --> 09:29.136
The commander was dead
before the crash.

09:29.169 --> 09:30.203
Most definitely.

09:30.237 --> 09:33.073
During my on-sight
examination,

09:33.106 --> 09:36.143
I noticed this
deep laceration.

09:36.176 --> 09:38.311
That from the crash?
No.

09:38.345 --> 09:41.381
The commander's head was
protected by the air bag.

09:41.414 --> 09:45.085
No, this wound is inconsistent
with his other injuries.

09:45.118 --> 09:50.057
Ergo, blunt force trauma
no doubt led to his demise.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.158
Anything else?

09:51.191 --> 09:53.060
Yeah, I found some
debris in the wound.

09:53.093 --> 09:55.062
I sent it up to
Abby for analysis.

09:55.095 --> 09:57.197
Okay.

09:57.230 --> 09:58.866
Thanks, Duck.

09:58.899 --> 10:02.903
Well, Commander,
let's get you ready to go home.

10:04.204 --> 10:05.405
(bowl humming)

10:05.438 --> 10:06.907
RONALD:
I don't understand.

10:06.940 --> 10:09.409
I thought you said
Derrick was in a car accident.

10:09.442 --> 10:12.112
It's an ongoing
investigation, Mr. Ayers.

10:12.145 --> 10:15.015
How did you know
Commander Reza?

10:15.048 --> 10:18.185
We worked on several community
service projects together.

10:18.218 --> 10:19.953
Ran in similar circles.

10:19.987 --> 10:23.090
A Muslim chaplain and a Yogi?

10:23.123 --> 10:26.393
Spirituality encompasses
all faiths, Agent Torres.

10:26.426 --> 10:28.195
It's through inclusion,
not division,

10:28.228 --> 10:29.663
that one becomes whole.

10:30.731 --> 10:32.199
Neat.

10:32.232 --> 10:34.267
Why did Commander Reza
call you last night?

10:34.301 --> 10:36.870
Derrick said
he had a favor to ask.

10:36.904 --> 10:38.271
He didn't go into details.

10:38.305 --> 10:40.808
We were supposed to meet
today for lunch to discuss.

10:40.841 --> 10:42.209
Last time you saw him?

10:42.242 --> 10:43.343
Uh, just this past Saturday

10:43.376 --> 10:44.978
at the harvest festival
he organized.

10:45.012 --> 10:47.214
You notice anything different
in his behavior?

10:47.247 --> 10:49.216
Did he seem preoccupied
or on edge?

10:49.249 --> 10:51.919
Not at all.
He was in great spirits.

10:51.952 --> 10:54.121
Derrick helped raise
over $25,000

10:54.154 --> 10:55.756
for the local
children's hospital.

10:55.789 --> 10:56.990
Well, that's impressive.

10:57.024 --> 10:58.291
RONALD:
That was Derrick.

10:58.325 --> 11:00.127
Constantly
helping others.

11:00.160 --> 11:03.196
He lived to serve
this community.

11:03.230 --> 11:05.733
GARETH:
As chaplain, Commander Reza

11:05.766 --> 11:09.136
interacted with hundreds of
parishioners of various faiths.

11:09.169 --> 11:12.172
Did he ever have any issues
with any of them?

11:12.205 --> 11:13.406
Not that he told me about.

11:13.440 --> 11:17.477
So, this interfaith church,
do you take confessions here,

11:17.510 --> 11:19.146
Mr., uh, Bainbridge?

11:19.179 --> 11:20.814
Oh, not me personally.

11:20.848 --> 11:22.215
I'm just the
office coordinator.

11:22.249 --> 11:25.152
But Derrick would often
counsel our members.

11:25.185 --> 11:28.822
Did you notice Commander Reza
spending more time

11:28.856 --> 11:30.223
with any particular parishioner?

11:30.257 --> 11:32.392
Uh...

11:32.425 --> 11:35.062
Well, actually,
yes, I...

11:35.095 --> 11:37.230
I'd noticed one woman
he was spending some time with

11:37.264 --> 11:38.365
over the past two weeks,

11:38.398 --> 11:40.768
but I-I didn't
catch her name.

11:40.801 --> 11:42.069
Can you describe her?

11:42.102 --> 11:45.205
Uh, she was late 20s,
Middle Eastern,

11:45.238 --> 11:47.741
uh, wore a headscarf.

11:47.775 --> 11:50.210
Oh, but I can't imagine she'd
be involved with his death.

11:50.243 --> 11:53.747
It... (chuckles)
looked as if they were friends.

11:55.883 --> 11:57.350
Thanks.

11:59.152 --> 12:01.254
(crunching)

12:02.956 --> 12:03.924
Are you Nick Torres?

12:03.957 --> 12:05.292
Who's asking?

12:05.325 --> 12:07.360
We're Ellie Bishop's
brothers.

12:07.394 --> 12:08.295
Oh, hey.

12:08.328 --> 12:09.797
Yeah, she mentioned
you guys were here.

12:09.830 --> 12:10.831
Nice to meet you.

12:12.165 --> 12:14.167
Okay. Nice talk.

12:16.136 --> 12:17.504
(clears throat)

12:17.537 --> 12:19.406
What, do you guys
want my lunch money or...?

12:19.439 --> 12:22.142
We want you to answer
a few questions.

12:22.175 --> 12:23.343
About what?

12:23.376 --> 12:25.212
Your relationship
with our sister.

12:25.245 --> 12:26.379
My what now?

12:27.380 --> 12:29.382
(chuckles):
Okay.

12:29.416 --> 12:32.152
Look, um, guys,
(clears throat) I appreciate

12:32.185 --> 12:33.320
the-the protective brother
routine,

12:33.353 --> 12:35.155
I-I respect it.

12:35.188 --> 12:37.991
But, uh, you're barking
up the wrong tree here.

12:38.025 --> 12:41.461
So you're not the coworker
she's been dating?

12:41.494 --> 12:44.331
Wait. Wait, me date Bishop?

12:44.364 --> 12:45.332
(laughs)

12:45.365 --> 12:47.167
No, no.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.169
No, no. (clicks tongue)

12:49.202 --> 12:50.403
She's not my type.

12:50.437 --> 12:52.205
Like, not at all.

12:52.239 --> 12:53.340
Oh.

12:53.373 --> 12:54.174
So you think our sister's

12:54.207 --> 12:55.976
not good enough for you,
is that it?

12:56.009 --> 12:58.045
Okay, listen,
that's not what I meant.

12:58.078 --> 12:59.446
I meant no disrespect.

12:59.479 --> 13:02.249
What I mean is that Bishop and I
are real good friends.

13:02.282 --> 13:04.284
That-that's all.
There's nothing more. That's it.

13:06.019 --> 13:08.421
All right, look.

13:08.455 --> 13:10.390
Now, you didn't hear it from me,

13:10.423 --> 13:12.960
but your sister's been
hanging out with this chap

13:12.993 --> 13:14.294
from the international desk.

13:14.327 --> 13:16.263
Now, my money would be
on that guy.

13:16.296 --> 13:17.464
What's his name?

13:17.497 --> 13:19.332
Clayton Reeves.

13:19.366 --> 13:20.433
(whispers):
Clayton Reeves.

13:20.467 --> 13:21.568
Yeah, tall, British,

13:21.601 --> 13:23.136
tailored suit,

13:23.170 --> 13:24.571
pretty ass jawline.

13:24.604 --> 13:26.473
We cool?

13:27.507 --> 13:28.842
We're cool.

13:28.876 --> 13:30.410
Great.

13:30.443 --> 13:31.444
Thanks.

13:37.050 --> 13:38.418
You do realize
he could've taken

13:38.451 --> 13:40.120
all three of us down
one-handed, right?

13:40.153 --> 13:42.122
Oh, without a doubt.
(sighs): Yeah.

13:42.155 --> 13:43.924
The things we do
for our sister.

13:43.957 --> 13:45.092
(exhales)

13:45.125 --> 13:46.326
(computer beeps)

13:46.359 --> 13:47.995
Come on.

13:48.028 --> 13:49.296
Why are you taking this
so personally?

13:49.329 --> 13:50.864
Because she's our friend.

13:50.898 --> 13:53.300
How could Bishop be
dating someone and not tell us?

13:53.333 --> 13:56.436
Um, probably because...

13:56.469 --> 13:58.906
it's someone we work with.

13:58.939 --> 14:00.373
How do you know that?

14:00.407 --> 14:02.075
I overheard
Bishop's brothers

14:02.109 --> 14:03.643
interrogating Pale
Dale in the hall.

14:03.676 --> 14:05.045
He started
hyperventilating.

14:05.078 --> 14:06.446
I had to give him
a paper bag.

14:06.479 --> 14:08.581
But, you know, Bishop
has her reasons.

14:08.615 --> 14:10.550
She'll tell us
when she's ready.

14:10.583 --> 14:12.385
I guess you're right.

14:12.419 --> 14:14.387
You're dying to know
who it is, too?

14:14.421 --> 14:16.056
You have no idea!

14:16.089 --> 14:17.390
Thank you.
(groans)

14:17.424 --> 14:18.391
(computer beeping)

14:18.425 --> 14:19.359
Look at this.

14:19.392 --> 14:20.961
Commander Reza's got some

14:20.994 --> 14:23.096
pretty heavily encrypted files
on his laptop.

14:23.130 --> 14:26.266
Didn't you say his computer
password was "password1"?

14:26.299 --> 14:29.402
Doesn't sound like someone
that'd be very tech savvy.

14:31.704 --> 14:33.606
Oh, a lot of classified files.

14:33.640 --> 14:34.975
Of what?

14:36.343 --> 14:38.378
Guantanamo Bay Detention Camp.

14:38.411 --> 14:40.981
Personnel,
detainee movements,

14:41.014 --> 14:42.382
guard assignments, even.

14:42.415 --> 14:45.218
How would a Navy chaplain

14:45.252 --> 14:48.088
get his hands on
sensitive military documents?

14:48.121 --> 14:49.556
Abby, if these get
into the wrong hands,

14:49.589 --> 14:52.225
this could be a serious threat
to national security.

14:52.259 --> 14:56.363
So what was Commander Reza
planning on doing with them?

15:06.173 --> 15:08.508
TORRES: Prior to his command
in Arlington, Commander Reza

15:08.541 --> 15:10.510
did a two-year tour
as a chaplain at Guantanamo Bay.

15:10.543 --> 15:12.479
BISHOP: All the classified
military files

15:12.512 --> 15:14.381
found on his laptop
had one common thread:

15:14.414 --> 15:16.716
Amir Hassan,

15:16.749 --> 15:18.551
one of the detainees
being held at Gitmo.

15:18.585 --> 15:20.187
What's his story?

15:20.220 --> 15:22.122
I suppose that's my cue.

15:23.090 --> 15:24.391
We got to get him a bell
or something.

15:24.424 --> 15:25.658
REEVES:
Hassan is originally

15:25.692 --> 15:27.227
from Jalalabad, Afghanistan.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.162
He was picked up by a joint U.S.

15:29.196 --> 15:31.631
and U.K. terrorism
task force back in 2005,

15:31.664 --> 15:33.633
just outside London.

15:33.666 --> 15:35.635
Looks like I'll be assisting
with the case.

15:35.668 --> 15:37.470
The more the merrier.
(chuckles)

15:38.371 --> 15:40.273
Why is Hassan
being surveilled?

15:40.307 --> 15:42.442
The main target
was Dawar Mahdavi.

15:42.475 --> 15:44.277
When you're ready.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.415
I remember him.

15:48.448 --> 15:50.617
Dawar Mahdavi was one
of the suspected

15:50.650 --> 15:53.486
conspirators in the 7/7
attacks in London.

15:53.520 --> 15:56.356
Traces of his DNA
were found on a backpack

15:56.389 --> 15:57.557
worn by one of the
suicide bombers.

15:57.590 --> 16:00.327
That brain of yours
is brilliant.

16:01.294 --> 16:02.495
(chuckles)
Truly.

16:02.529 --> 16:04.431
Uh, can we stay on topic here?

16:04.464 --> 16:05.432
I agree.

16:05.465 --> 16:06.566
(clears throat)

16:06.599 --> 16:08.301
Mahdavi, uh,
recruited his men

16:08.335 --> 16:09.469
from a mosque he
used to frequent.

16:09.502 --> 16:10.770
Amir Hassan

16:10.803 --> 16:13.206
was one of three men
seen with Mahdavi back in 2005.

16:13.240 --> 16:16.143
When chatter flagged an
up-and-coming attack,

16:16.176 --> 16:17.444
they were taken
into custody.

16:17.477 --> 16:19.212
Well, that still doesn't
explain why Commander Reza

16:19.246 --> 16:20.380
had a dossier on Hassan.

16:20.413 --> 16:23.516
Among those files were video
recordings of Amir Hassan's

16:23.550 --> 16:25.318
interrogations
while at Gitmo.

16:25.352 --> 16:26.619
They must be important,

16:26.653 --> 16:28.055
or why else would
Reza have them?

16:28.088 --> 16:30.490
One problem:
they're all in Pashto.

16:30.523 --> 16:32.059
That's not a problem.

16:32.092 --> 16:33.360
Bishop, get to it.

16:33.393 --> 16:34.361
You know Pashto?

16:34.394 --> 16:35.762
Mm-hmm.

16:35.795 --> 16:37.064
REEVES:
What did I say?

16:37.097 --> 16:38.031
Brilliant.

16:38.065 --> 16:39.332
(Bishop chuckles)

16:39.366 --> 16:41.034
Gibbs, there's hours of footage
to go through.

16:41.068 --> 16:42.469
I mean, I can handle some,
but we'll need to

16:42.502 --> 16:43.536
loop in a translator.
Yeah, set it up.

16:43.570 --> 16:45.672
Torres, talk to the C.O.
at Gitmo.

16:45.705 --> 16:47.540
Find out what contact
Commander Reza had

16:47.574 --> 16:49.542
with Amir Hassan.

16:49.576 --> 16:50.777
(chuckles)

16:50.810 --> 16:52.579
What about me?

16:52.612 --> 16:55.548
I want all the intel the
task force gathered on Hassan.

16:55.582 --> 16:57.417
That's it?

16:57.450 --> 17:01.154
I was hoping for something
a little bit more challenging.

17:05.292 --> 17:07.260
QUINN: How long
have you been commander

17:07.294 --> 17:09.562
at the Gitmo detention
group, Colonel Driscoll?

17:09.596 --> 17:10.697
Nearly two years.

17:10.730 --> 17:12.565
And, uh, you're familiar

17:12.599 --> 17:14.567
with Commander Reza
and Amir Hassan?

17:14.601 --> 17:17.070
That's affirmative.

17:17.104 --> 17:18.671
What sort of contact
did they have?

17:18.705 --> 17:21.141
As chaplain, Commander Reza
had weekly meetings

17:21.174 --> 17:23.710
with several of our detainees,
including Hassan.

17:23.743 --> 17:25.578
What'd they talk about?

17:25.612 --> 17:29.582
The military doesn't record
religious counseling sessions.

17:29.616 --> 17:31.584
Oh, you don't really expect us
to believe that, do you?

17:31.618 --> 17:33.520
Doesn't matter to me
what you believe,

17:33.553 --> 17:35.588
Agent Torres, it's the truth.

17:35.622 --> 17:37.290
Fine.
What can you tell us

17:37.324 --> 17:38.525
about Commander Reza?

17:38.558 --> 17:41.561
Well, during his tour here,
there was a significant decrease

17:41.594 --> 17:43.663
in aggressive behavior
among the detainees.

17:43.696 --> 17:46.166
I credit Commander Reza
for that.

17:46.199 --> 17:49.136
He was a calming presence.

17:49.169 --> 17:51.438
I was sad to see him go.

17:51.471 --> 17:53.440
Oh, so you liked him?

17:53.473 --> 17:55.575
I like people who do their job.

17:55.608 --> 17:58.511
So, yes, I liked him.

17:58.545 --> 18:00.213
More than others.

18:00.247 --> 18:02.249
Meaning what?

18:02.282 --> 18:05.718
Some of my soldiers
were suspicious

18:05.752 --> 18:09.222
of Commander Reza's closeness
with the detainees

18:09.256 --> 18:10.657
and believed he was
colluding with them.

18:10.690 --> 18:12.359
And did you look into that?

18:12.392 --> 18:13.560
Of course,

18:13.593 --> 18:15.895
but the investigation
turned up nothing.

18:15.928 --> 18:18.131
I wrote it off
as a baseless claim.

18:18.165 --> 18:21.368
Did you give Commander Reza
access to Hassan's files?

18:21.401 --> 18:24.737
I don't make a habit of sharing
classified military documents

18:24.771 --> 18:26.739
with unauthorized personnel.

18:26.773 --> 18:28.708
How'd he get 'em?
No idea.

18:28.741 --> 18:30.543
But I plan to find out.

18:30.577 --> 18:31.878
Oh, so do we, Colonel.

18:31.911 --> 18:33.680
You can bet on it.

18:35.748 --> 18:37.850
You really have a way
with people, Torres.

18:37.884 --> 18:40.420
Yeah, it's a gift.

18:44.191 --> 18:46.926
Agent Gibbs,
it's good to see you.

18:46.959 --> 18:49.462
Qasim. How's life at the annex?

18:49.496 --> 18:51.464
It's going very well.
I have you both

18:51.498 --> 18:52.599
to thank for that.

18:52.632 --> 18:54.334
Well, you did the work, not us.

18:54.367 --> 18:55.768
Bishop bring you
up to speed?

18:55.802 --> 18:59.639
Yes, you require some help
with some Pashto translations.

18:59.672 --> 19:02.509
Yes, "some" being hundreds
of hours of interrogations.

19:02.542 --> 19:04.477
Hope you didn't
have any evening plans.

19:04.511 --> 19:05.945
This is top priority.

19:05.978 --> 19:07.347
Work comes first.

19:07.380 --> 19:09.382
That's the right answer.

19:11.851 --> 19:13.786
Dinner's on me.

19:14.787 --> 19:15.822
Mmm.

19:15.855 --> 19:16.889
(chuckles)

19:16.923 --> 19:18.391
(elevator bell dings)

19:19.792 --> 19:22.829
Oh, uh, look,
it's, uh, MI6 Officer

19:22.862 --> 19:23.830
Clayton Reeves.

19:23.863 --> 19:25.832
Boy, am I happy
to see you.

19:25.865 --> 19:27.400
What's with you?

19:27.434 --> 19:28.735
Oh, me? Oh, nothing, nothing.

19:28.768 --> 19:29.536
I'm just tracking down that,

19:29.569 --> 19:31.438
uh, mystery woman
seen with, uh,

19:31.471 --> 19:32.372
Commander Reza.

19:32.405 --> 19:33.573
Yeah.

19:33.606 --> 19:37.410
Have you met Agent Bishop's,
uh, brothers?

19:37.444 --> 19:39.579
Hey. Pleasure.

19:39.612 --> 19:40.980
Big, big fan of your sister.

19:41.013 --> 19:42.782
(chuckles):
See, boys?

19:42.815 --> 19:43.983
What'd I tell you?

19:44.016 --> 19:44.984
(elevator bell dings)

19:45.017 --> 19:46.219
Good luck.

19:49.389 --> 19:52.359
You guys, uh, enjoying D.C.?

19:52.392 --> 19:54.294
This place has, uh,
great, great energy.

19:54.327 --> 19:55.695
It's, uh...

19:58.331 --> 20:00.233
You can can the
small talk, 007.

20:00.267 --> 20:01.701
The jig is up.

20:01.734 --> 20:03.603
(chuckles) I'm sorry?

20:03.636 --> 20:05.238
We know you're dating
our sister.

20:05.272 --> 20:06.406
(laughs)

20:06.439 --> 20:08.275
Someone's telling you porkies.

20:08.308 --> 20:09.409
What'd he say?

20:09.442 --> 20:10.810
Think he just
called us fat.

20:10.843 --> 20:12.745
No, he said that
you were told a lie.

20:12.779 --> 20:15.815
What about that trip
to Scotland she took?

20:15.848 --> 20:16.683
You weren't with her?

20:16.716 --> 20:18.285
No.

20:18.318 --> 20:20.753
I was. But we just
went as mates. That's all.

20:20.787 --> 20:22.722
"Mates" means friends.
Yeah, we got that one.

20:22.755 --> 20:25.392
So, are we... are we square?

20:25.425 --> 20:26.926
Just one more question.

20:28.461 --> 20:30.397
When "mates" travel together,

20:30.430 --> 20:32.765
how many hotel rooms
do they book?

20:32.799 --> 20:33.833
One or two?

20:34.801 --> 20:36.436
Two.

20:36.469 --> 20:38.471
He hesitated.
I took a breath.

20:38.505 --> 20:39.972
Robbie, what do you think?

20:40.006 --> 20:43.343
(British accent): Looks like
you're in a spot of bother.

20:46.813 --> 20:48.348
GIBBS:
What am I looking at?

20:48.381 --> 20:50.016
It's guts, Gibbs.

20:50.049 --> 20:51.584
Automotive innards.

20:51.618 --> 20:52.885
Vehicular entrails.

20:52.919 --> 20:54.587
The bowels...
Abbs.

20:54.621 --> 20:56.856
Sorry, there was a Night Gallery
marathon last night.

20:56.889 --> 20:59.759
This is what McGee and I
painstakingly

20:59.792 --> 21:02.762
went through to try to put
together the navigation system

21:02.795 --> 21:04.697
from Commander Reza's car.

21:04.731 --> 21:06.333
We were able
to extract the data

21:06.366 --> 21:08.668
and retrace his movements
the day he was killed.

21:08.701 --> 21:10.670
Uh, normally, we would've
gotten that information

21:10.703 --> 21:12.605
from his cell phone, but
the commander doesn't own one.

21:12.639 --> 21:13.840
Did you hear that, Gibbs?

21:13.873 --> 21:14.907
Someone who

21:14.941 --> 21:16.042
hated technology more than you.

21:16.075 --> 21:17.043
Mind blown.

21:17.076 --> 21:18.611
What'd you find?

21:19.479 --> 21:21.013
ABBY:
Voila.

21:21.047 --> 21:22.849
A day in the life

21:22.882 --> 21:24.083
of Commander Reza.

21:24.116 --> 21:25.718
Left his house
in the morning.

21:25.752 --> 21:27.420
He went to work,
had lunch downtown.

21:27.454 --> 21:29.722
Stopped at a hotel,
went to the bank,

21:29.756 --> 21:32.392
headed back to work,
then home.

21:32.425 --> 21:33.560
And then the crash.

21:33.593 --> 21:34.561
Now, which one
of those things

21:34.594 --> 21:35.562
is not like the other?

21:35.595 --> 21:36.629
The hotel.

21:36.663 --> 21:37.864
Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding!

21:37.897 --> 21:38.765
Take it away, McGee.

21:38.798 --> 21:40.433
McGEE: Pulled the list
of registered guests

21:40.467 --> 21:42.435
staying at
Arlington Roads Inn.

21:42.469 --> 21:45.872
Now, one of the rooms is
registered to Samira Hassan.

21:45.905 --> 21:46.873
That's the sister
of Amir Hassan,

21:46.906 --> 21:48.875
one of our Gitmo
detainees

21:48.908 --> 21:50.877
who Commander Reza
had files on.

21:51.944 --> 21:54.347
SAMIRA:
I have done nothing wrong.

21:54.381 --> 21:56.816
You have no right
to hold me here.

21:56.849 --> 21:57.984
Guess again.

21:58.017 --> 21:59.719
McGEE: You were one
of the last people

21:59.752 --> 22:01.488
to see Commander Reza alive.

22:01.521 --> 22:03.890
I didn't kill Derrick.

22:03.923 --> 22:05.358
He was a friend.

22:05.392 --> 22:07.460
A military officer.

22:07.494 --> 22:10.129
And you're the sister
of a terrorist.

22:10.162 --> 22:11.798
That's an odd pairing.

22:11.831 --> 22:14.734
My brother is not a terrorist.

22:14.767 --> 22:16.936
I have spent years

22:16.969 --> 22:19.472
pleading with your government
to look into Amir's arrest,

22:19.506 --> 22:20.973
but no one would listen.

22:21.007 --> 22:24.377
Is that why you contacted
Commander Reza?

22:24.411 --> 22:27.380
He's the one
who reached out to me.

22:27.414 --> 22:29.849
Derrick said he had proof
my brother was being

22:29.882 --> 22:31.951
wrongfully detained
at Guantanamo.

22:31.984 --> 22:34.721
What proof?

22:34.754 --> 22:36.122
All he told me was that
someone on the inside

22:36.155 --> 22:37.323
was going to help.

22:37.356 --> 22:41.528
There are some people who don't
want the truth to come out.

22:41.561 --> 22:44.764
Derrick was silenced
because he knew too much.

22:44.797 --> 22:46.032
(cell phone beeps)

22:56.876 --> 22:59.679
Samira's telling the truth
about her brother.

22:59.712 --> 23:03.616
Qasim and I were translating
Amir Hassan's interrogations.

23:03.650 --> 23:06.686
I noticed that
the corresponding transcriptions

23:06.719 --> 23:08.455
didn't match what he was saying.

23:08.488 --> 23:10.022
Gibbs, someone altered
the records

23:10.056 --> 23:13.159
to make it look like Hassan was
withholding information.

23:13.192 --> 23:15.127
He was set up.

23:26.205 --> 23:29.175
(interrogator speaking Pashto
over TV)

23:32.011 --> 23:34.013
(Hassan speaking Pashto)

23:39.586 --> 23:42.655
Hassan was asked
to give up Mahdavi's targets.

23:42.689 --> 23:44.757
The altered Gitmo
transcript has

23:44.791 --> 23:47.927
Hassan's response as:
"I will never betray Mahdavi.

23:47.960 --> 23:49.462
He is my brother."

23:49.496 --> 23:51.898
What did Hassan
actually say?

23:51.931 --> 23:54.100
"I've only met Mahdavi
a few times.

23:54.133 --> 23:55.735
"He's not my friend.

23:55.768 --> 23:57.570
Please, you have
the wrong person."

23:57.604 --> 23:59.772
Bishop and Qasim found
dozens more like it.

23:59.806 --> 24:01.708
This was the evidence
Commander Reza

24:01.741 --> 24:03.009
intended to turn over

24:03.042 --> 24:05.745
in order to secure
Amir Hassan's release.

24:05.778 --> 24:07.614
Our intelligence had him

24:07.647 --> 24:09.248
as part of a terror cell.

24:09.281 --> 24:11.984
The only thing connecting
Hassan to Mahdavi

24:12.018 --> 24:14.954
is a few photos of them exiting
a mosque at the same time.

24:14.987 --> 24:17.557
You're telling me
that an innocent man

24:17.590 --> 24:20.627
spent 11 years in
a U.S. military detention camp

24:20.660 --> 24:23.630
because he was in the wrong
place at the wrong time?

24:23.663 --> 24:25.498
It's a possibility.

24:25.532 --> 24:27.199
That's not good enough,
Officer Reeves.

24:27.233 --> 24:28.901
I want solid answers.

24:28.935 --> 24:30.236
So do we, Leon.

24:31.538 --> 24:33.673
Bishop and Qasim are
en route to Gitmo now.

24:33.706 --> 24:35.207
And Commander Reza?

24:35.241 --> 24:37.577
If his death is connected
to Hassan,

24:37.610 --> 24:39.612
we'll find out.

24:42.148 --> 24:43.983
(helicopter passing,
indistinct radio chatter)

24:44.016 --> 24:45.117
QASIM:
Are you all right?

24:45.151 --> 24:47.954
No, not really. (sighs)

24:47.987 --> 24:49.288
What is it?

24:49.321 --> 24:50.690
HEALY:
Right through here.

24:54.060 --> 24:55.895
Uh, he, uh, won't need those.

24:55.928 --> 24:56.729
It's protocol, ma'am.

24:56.763 --> 24:58.931
Not ours, Sergeant.
Take 'em off.

25:13.646 --> 25:14.981
Amir...

25:16.248 --> 25:18.250
(speaking Pashto)

25:25.625 --> 25:27.193
(sighs)

25:27.226 --> 25:28.761
He's not gonna talk to me.

25:28.795 --> 25:30.730
This place taught him
not to trust anyone,

25:30.763 --> 25:33.733
especially U.S. agents.

25:33.766 --> 25:36.102
Then we convince him.

25:36.135 --> 25:38.705
And we start by
telling him the truth.

25:38.738 --> 25:41.240
The truth has no place here.

25:43.109 --> 25:44.844
You speak English?

25:44.877 --> 25:47.880
A skill I learned in this cage.

25:49.982 --> 25:51.851
If you are here to ask me

25:51.884 --> 25:54.153
about my extremist
connections,

25:54.186 --> 25:56.689
you're wasting your time.

25:56.723 --> 25:58.958
I'm not a terrorist.

25:58.991 --> 26:01.828
We know, Amir.
We're here to help you.

26:06.032 --> 26:07.967
Commander Reza.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.136
He was a chaplain here
a few years ago.

26:10.169 --> 26:11.270
What about him?

26:11.303 --> 26:14.807
He was working to get you
released from Guantanamo.

26:14.841 --> 26:17.844
He-he found evidence that you
were being wrongfully detained.

26:20.079 --> 26:21.313
(speaks Pashto)

26:21.347 --> 26:24.183
(responds in Pashto)

26:27.687 --> 26:30.657
If this is true,
then let me speak to Derrick.

26:30.690 --> 26:34.193
I trust him.
He wouldn't lie to me.

26:34.226 --> 26:35.795
(sighs)

26:37.964 --> 26:39.966
Commander Reza is dead.

26:41.934 --> 26:43.936
This is one hell of
an oversight, Colonel.

26:43.970 --> 26:46.739
The transcriptions in question
were before my time.

26:46.773 --> 26:49.241
It's not the time
to pass the buck.

26:49.275 --> 26:50.810
I am merely stating facts.

26:50.843 --> 26:53.112
In 2005,
some detainee translations

26:53.145 --> 26:55.748
were conducted by
private defense contractors.

26:55.782 --> 26:57.283
It was a flawed practice.

26:57.316 --> 26:58.951
One no longer used at Gitmo.

26:58.985 --> 27:02.021
I'm afraid that's
too little too late, Colonel.

27:02.054 --> 27:05.291
Who was the translator
assigned to Amir Hassan?

27:07.026 --> 27:08.394
His name's Brendan Peters.

27:08.427 --> 27:11.964
He worked for
Wynnewood Security Services.

27:11.998 --> 27:16.168
Someone killed Derrick because
he was trying to free me?

27:16.202 --> 27:18.938
That's what we're trying
to find out.

27:18.971 --> 27:19.939
QASIM:
Can you think

27:19.972 --> 27:23.142
of who might want to go after
Commander Reza?

27:23.175 --> 27:26.713
How could I possibly know?

27:26.746 --> 27:28.815
I've had no contact
with the outside world

27:28.848 --> 27:31.017
in years.

27:31.050 --> 27:34.120
Not with my family.

27:34.153 --> 27:35.888
Not with anyone.

27:35.922 --> 27:39.225
Derrick restored
my faith that I might

27:39.258 --> 27:41.193
once again be a free man.

27:44.063 --> 27:46.098
He died for nothing.

27:46.132 --> 27:48.167
That is not true, Amir.

27:48.200 --> 27:51.037
He was fighting for you,
and so are we.

27:51.070 --> 27:54.707
I was put in this place
by people like you,

27:54.741 --> 27:56.108
Agent Bishop.

27:56.142 --> 27:57.910
People who think
I'm a terrorist

27:57.944 --> 27:59.445
because I'm Muslim.

28:02.148 --> 28:04.951
Why should I believe
a word you say?

28:07.119 --> 28:08.921
I didn't trust her either.

28:10.356 --> 28:12.124
Not when we first met.

28:18.130 --> 28:21.467
I was once in a similar
situation as you.

28:21.500 --> 28:24.937
And when I thought
all hope was lost,

28:24.971 --> 28:29.308
it was Agent Bishop and NCIS

28:29.341 --> 28:32.344
who stood by me.

28:32.378 --> 28:34.246
I am alive
because of them.

28:36.282 --> 28:39.251
Trust only works

28:39.285 --> 28:41.487
when it goes both ways.

28:49.395 --> 28:53.365
When I met Dawar Mahdavi,
I didn't know who he really was

28:53.399 --> 28:56.202
or the terrible things
he had done.

28:56.235 --> 29:00.206
We had only spoken to each other
in passing at our mosque.

29:03.275 --> 29:08.314
My life ended because of a man
I hardly knew.

29:11.150 --> 29:15.254
I told the truth,
and no one would believe me.

29:17.423 --> 29:20.092
No one except for Derrick.

29:23.395 --> 29:27.399
We can't change
what happened to you, Amir,

29:27.433 --> 29:31.103
but we are gonna finish
what Commander Reza started.

29:31.137 --> 29:34.406
And we are not leaving here
without you.

29:37.309 --> 29:38.410
Admit it.

29:38.444 --> 29:40.880
What you did was a serious
violation of the guy code.

29:40.913 --> 29:43.282
Oh, are you still
going on about this?

29:43.315 --> 29:45.517
Come on, man, I'm with her.
Let it go.

29:45.551 --> 29:46.886
That's easy for
Quinn to say.

29:46.919 --> 29:48.420
She's not the one you
threw to the wolves.

29:48.454 --> 29:50.389
The wolves?
Come on, man.

29:50.422 --> 29:53.325
Bishop's brothers are, like,
(whimpers) little pups.

29:53.359 --> 29:54.994
Plus, I thought
you could handle yourself.

29:55.027 --> 29:56.295
You're a big boy.

29:56.328 --> 29:58.297
Would you care for
a demonstration?

29:58.330 --> 29:59.298
Sure.

29:59.331 --> 30:00.599
Oh, no. No more.

30:00.632 --> 30:02.401
Whichever one of you
is dating Bishop,

30:02.434 --> 30:05.137
just fess up, and we can
be done with this.

30:05.171 --> 30:07.139
He flinched.
I blinked.

30:07.173 --> 30:08.440
Oh, you flinched a little.

30:08.474 --> 30:09.441
That's not proof.

30:10.309 --> 30:11.443
I have proof.

30:11.477 --> 30:14.914
I did a statistical analysis

30:14.947 --> 30:17.016
of Bishop's personality,
and cross-referenced it

30:17.049 --> 30:18.317
with everyone in the office
to see who would be

30:18.350 --> 30:19.919
the most probable match.

30:19.952 --> 30:22.922
Torres, you only scored
a 17% probability...

30:22.955 --> 30:24.490
Yes!
...so you're out.

30:24.523 --> 30:28.294
Reeves, you scored
an impressive

30:28.327 --> 30:31.130
65%, so that's a possibility.

30:31.163 --> 30:32.331
I told you it was him.

30:32.364 --> 30:33.399
ABBY:
Now, wait.

30:33.432 --> 30:34.433
Not so fast, Nick.

30:34.466 --> 30:36.135
There's someone else

30:36.168 --> 30:37.436
who beat Reeves' score

30:37.469 --> 30:38.337
with a whopping

30:38.370 --> 30:42.074
87% probability.

30:44.410 --> 30:46.545
What?!

30:46.578 --> 30:47.880
Leroy Jethro Gibbs.

30:48.680 --> 30:50.282
Are you serious?

30:50.316 --> 30:51.083
Come on, Abby, that's...

30:51.117 --> 30:53.085
Ha, ha, ha, ha,
that's a good one.

30:54.086 --> 30:55.254
Actually, I can picture it.

30:55.287 --> 30:57.223
GIBBS: Picture what?
Hey, Gibbs, hey!

30:57.256 --> 30:59.291
We were just, uh,
you know, sharing some

30:59.325 --> 31:02.461
enlightening scientific
analysis here.

31:02.494 --> 31:03.395
How about sharing
something else?

31:03.429 --> 31:04.897
Like a lead.

31:04.931 --> 31:06.065
I got a lead, boss.

31:06.098 --> 31:07.399
Been following up

31:07.433 --> 31:08.267
on Brendan Peters,

31:08.300 --> 31:10.402
the translator
assigned to Amir Hassan.

31:10.436 --> 31:12.671
Brendan Peters doesn't exist.
It's an alias.

31:12.704 --> 31:15.407
Many defense contractors
use an nom de guerre

31:15.441 --> 31:16.508
for security reasons.

31:16.542 --> 31:18.444
Maintains anonymity.

31:18.477 --> 31:20.446
I pulled his fingerprints
from Gitmo's records,

31:20.479 --> 31:22.514
ran it through the system,
got a hit.

31:22.548 --> 31:24.683
Turns out Brendan Peters

31:24.716 --> 31:26.618
is really Ronald Ayers.

31:26.652 --> 31:28.387
The meditation guy.

31:28.420 --> 31:30.322
Time to bust up
someone's chi.

31:36.362 --> 31:38.330
All right,
I got the front.

31:38.364 --> 31:39.631
Got the back.

31:39.665 --> 31:41.633
Reeves, take
the grounds.

31:51.510 --> 31:53.512
*

32:03.555 --> 32:05.557
Don't move.
Drop the weapon.

32:07.559 --> 32:09.195
The place is surrounded, Ayers.

32:09.228 --> 32:10.562
Doesn't look that way.

32:10.596 --> 32:12.598
Drop it.

32:18.070 --> 32:19.671
Take a quick walk.

32:27.713 --> 32:29.615
Yep, real quick.

32:32.751 --> 32:34.486
Don't even say it.

32:34.520 --> 32:36.188
Hero, baby.

32:37.289 --> 32:40.226
It's what I do all day, son.

32:49.301 --> 32:50.602
I can explain.

32:50.636 --> 32:53.205
Pulling a gun on
a federal agent?

32:53.239 --> 32:54.606
Talk about bad karma.

32:54.640 --> 32:56.475
Enjoy your next life
as a gutter rat.

32:56.508 --> 32:58.610
It's not
what it looks like.

32:58.644 --> 32:59.645
Oh, this should
be interesting.

32:59.678 --> 33:02.348
I've been on edge
ever since Derrick's murder.

33:02.381 --> 33:04.483
I thought your agents
were there to kill me.

33:04.516 --> 33:06.485
It was just a simple
misunderstanding.

33:07.486 --> 33:10.022
Hmm.

33:10.056 --> 33:12.558
If that's all it is,
you're free to go.

33:12.591 --> 33:13.492
Really?

33:13.525 --> 33:14.760
No!

33:14.793 --> 33:16.028
Talk!

33:16.062 --> 33:16.662
About what?

33:16.695 --> 33:18.330
Amir Hassan.

33:18.364 --> 33:20.499
His interrogation transcripts.

33:22.568 --> 33:24.103
Who altered them?

33:25.171 --> 33:26.472
I did.

33:26.505 --> 33:28.307
Well, congratulations,

33:28.340 --> 33:30.676
you just got downgraded
to a flea on a gutter rat.

33:30.709 --> 33:33.512
I didn't have a choice.

33:33.545 --> 33:35.414
I was ordered to do it.

33:35.447 --> 33:36.548
By who?

33:36.582 --> 33:39.418
The defense firm I worked for.

33:39.451 --> 33:41.453
We were told
to help prolong

33:41.487 --> 33:43.522
the confinement of detainees
who refused to produce intel

33:43.555 --> 33:45.257
vital to the War on Terror.

33:46.592 --> 33:48.627
And how do you
sleep at night?

33:48.660 --> 33:50.329
I didn't.

33:50.362 --> 33:51.697
That's why I quit.

33:51.730 --> 33:55.667
I never felt right
about what we did at Gitmo.

33:55.701 --> 33:58.504
Or for what I did
to Amir Hassan.

33:58.537 --> 33:59.538
You knew he was innocent.

33:59.571 --> 34:02.174
And you let him rot
in that cell for 11 years?

34:02.208 --> 34:04.743
I'm not proud of
what I've done.

34:04.776 --> 34:06.312
And that's why you
killed Commander Reza?

34:06.345 --> 34:07.413
To keep your secret?

34:07.446 --> 34:09.148
I didn't kill Derrick.

34:09.181 --> 34:11.450
I was helping him.

34:11.483 --> 34:13.685
I'm the one who gave him
those files on Amir Hassan.

34:15.554 --> 34:17.689
I was trying to right a wrong.

34:19.858 --> 34:21.693
(helicopter passing,
indistinct chatter)

34:29.568 --> 34:32.738
Amir Hassan was right.

34:33.605 --> 34:35.641
I have sent people here.

34:37.709 --> 34:40.279
For years, I've...

34:40.312 --> 34:43.549
I've known about Gitmo
and I've talked about it, but...

34:43.582 --> 34:45.251
(sighs)

34:45.284 --> 34:48.720
...seeing it,
it's not what I expected.

34:48.754 --> 34:51.757
What did you imagine?

34:51.790 --> 34:53.692
I don't know.

34:53.725 --> 34:56.695
I know there are
people detained here

34:56.728 --> 34:58.364
who have done
horrible things,

34:58.397 --> 35:00.399
but...

35:00.432 --> 35:02.668
this doesn't
feel like justice.

35:02.701 --> 35:07.273
Well, fear often makes us
do things that we shouldn't.

35:07.306 --> 35:09.275
But that's human.

35:10.576 --> 35:12.744
What if there's
another Amir in there

35:12.778 --> 35:14.680
and we just don't know it?

35:17.749 --> 35:19.785
He was a
22-year-old kid.

35:21.420 --> 35:23.889
And we took away
11 years of his life.

35:27.659 --> 35:29.661
Can't ever make that right.

35:29.695 --> 35:32.264
You are not
the one responsible

35:32.298 --> 35:34.233
for Amir Hassan's arrest.

35:34.266 --> 35:37.436
But you are responsible
for his release.

35:39.838 --> 35:42.674
He's leaving here
a free man.

35:42.708 --> 35:44.710
(gate buzzes)

35:51.750 --> 35:55.221
Still doesn't seem like enough.

35:55.254 --> 35:58.324
Believe me...

35:58.357 --> 36:00.259
that is everything.

36:09.735 --> 36:11.403
Wait, Bishop and Gibbs?

36:11.437 --> 36:13.439
No, no, no.
Y-You got to be crazy.

36:13.472 --> 36:16.575
Are you questioning
the validity of my findings?

36:16.608 --> 36:19.545
Statistical data
is hardly reliable.

36:19.578 --> 36:23.515
Timothy Farragut McGee,
I will have you know

36:23.549 --> 36:25.984
that all my data
is accurate.

36:26.017 --> 36:29.288
It predicted when you and
Delilah would move in together,

36:29.321 --> 36:31.890
and... when you would
get engaged,

36:31.923 --> 36:33.359
and...

36:33.392 --> 36:34.760
when you would
have your first kid.

36:34.793 --> 36:37.629
Abby, how could it possibly
know that? Come on.

36:38.830 --> 36:40.532
Did it say whether it was
a boy or girl?

36:40.566 --> 36:42.568
Wouldn't you
like to know.

36:44.570 --> 36:45.837
Where's Gibbs?

36:45.871 --> 36:47.673
He's up with Vance.
Did you guys find anything?

36:47.706 --> 36:49.841
One of the stops that Commander
Reza made on the day he died

36:49.875 --> 36:51.477
was to a bank in Arlington.

36:51.510 --> 36:52.978
Right, we already knew that.

36:53.011 --> 36:55.947
His account showed that he made
an ATM withdrawal at 4:45 p.m.

36:55.981 --> 36:56.848
That's right.

36:56.882 --> 36:58.717
Except he went there
on other business.

36:58.750 --> 36:59.818
A teller at the bank

36:59.851 --> 37:01.820
confirms that she assisted Reza.

37:01.853 --> 37:03.455
He requested over
two years worth

37:03.489 --> 37:04.856
of checking account
statements.

37:04.890 --> 37:05.791
His personal account?

37:05.824 --> 37:06.858
No.

37:06.892 --> 37:08.960
Armed Forces
Interfaith Association.

37:10.862 --> 37:12.063
We pulled the same
records and found

37:12.097 --> 37:15.767
over $250,000 in withdrawals
earmarked for local charities.

37:15.801 --> 37:16.968
TORRES: Yeah, and we
checked with the charities,

37:17.002 --> 37:19.004
and none of them
have received the donations.

37:19.037 --> 37:20.038
Who made the withdrawals?

37:20.071 --> 37:22.341
The primary account holder:

37:22.374 --> 37:24.009
Gareth Bainbridge.

37:28.747 --> 37:29.981
(car alarm chirps)

37:33.419 --> 37:34.853
Hi there.

37:34.886 --> 37:37.556
Agent Quinn, did we have
an appointment?

37:37.589 --> 37:38.824
We didn't, no.

37:38.857 --> 37:40.626
I just had some
follow-up questions.

37:40.659 --> 37:43.028
Oh, well, of course.
Let's, um, talk inside.

37:43.061 --> 37:44.596
Oh, we can't.

37:44.630 --> 37:46.332
They're still processing
the crime scene.

37:46.365 --> 37:48.066
Excuse me?
Yeah.

37:48.099 --> 37:49.568
You familiar with,
uh, BLUESTAR?

37:49.601 --> 37:52.838
It's this nifty little spray
that helps you, uh,

37:52.871 --> 37:55.073
detect washed-out
bloodstains.

37:55.106 --> 37:56.808
Found a lot of it
in your office.

37:58.844 --> 38:00.779
Are you going somewhere?

38:02.848 --> 38:04.783
It was an accident.

38:04.816 --> 38:06.485
What was?

38:06.518 --> 38:08.920
When Derrick confronted me
about the money,

38:08.954 --> 38:10.756
he wouldn't let me explain.

38:10.789 --> 38:12.758
He went to
call the police,

38:12.791 --> 38:14.760
and I pushed him.

38:14.793 --> 38:16.862
He tripped and his head
hit the desk.

38:16.895 --> 38:17.929
And instead of calling 911,

38:17.963 --> 38:19.865
you decided to try
and cover it up?

38:19.898 --> 38:21.633
I panicked. I...
Mm-hmm.

38:21.667 --> 38:22.701
I never meant
to hurt him.

38:22.734 --> 38:23.869
I...

38:23.902 --> 38:24.936
You got to believe me.

38:24.970 --> 38:26.372
We don't.

38:26.405 --> 38:28.540
(siren approaching)

38:37.483 --> 38:40.352
(elevator bell dings)

38:40.386 --> 38:42.087
Oh.

38:42.120 --> 38:44.055
Gibbs, you're here.

38:46.091 --> 38:47.393
I work here, too.

38:47.426 --> 38:48.727
Yeah.

38:48.760 --> 38:50.896
Uh, listen, I wanted to...

38:52.598 --> 38:53.932
What happened to my phone?

38:53.965 --> 38:57.903
Next time you leave the country
on assignment, Bishop,

38:57.936 --> 38:59.070
tell your brothers.

38:59.104 --> 39:00.839
How many times did they call?

39:01.907 --> 39:03.809
Too many. Got it.

39:08.580 --> 39:09.781
What?

39:10.816 --> 39:11.950
Amir Hassan.

39:11.983 --> 39:13.919
He held on for all those years

39:13.952 --> 39:16.087
believing...

39:16.121 --> 39:20.659
the truth would set him free,
and it did.

39:21.693 --> 39:23.729
Listen, Gibbs.

39:23.762 --> 39:26.698
I don't want to lie
to you anymore.

39:28.434 --> 39:30.035
(sighs)
I wanted to tell you earlier,

39:30.068 --> 39:32.638
but I didn't know how to say it,
and then more time passed,

39:32.671 --> 39:34.840
and it's just that...

39:34.873 --> 39:36.808
What, Bishop?

39:36.842 --> 39:39.144
(sighs) I broke rule 12.

39:39.177 --> 39:42.814
At first, we...

39:42.848 --> 39:44.583
were just good friends.

39:44.616 --> 39:50.088
And then a few months ago,
it turned into something more.

39:50.121 --> 39:53.992
And... I won't apologize for it.

39:54.025 --> 39:55.927
Not-not because that
would break another rule,

39:55.961 --> 39:57.563
but because...

39:58.630 --> 39:59.665
Gibbs...

39:59.698 --> 40:01.600
I like him.

40:01.633 --> 40:03.134
A lot.

40:04.169 --> 40:06.805
Took you long enough.

40:09.007 --> 40:11.877
That's it?

40:11.910 --> 40:13.912
Happy Thanksgiving,
Bishop.

40:19.150 --> 40:21.820
ANNOUNCER: Hope you enjoyed
the Thanksgiving halftime show.

40:21.853 --> 40:25.524
And we are just moments away
from the second half.

40:25.557 --> 40:27.926
For those of you just tuning in,
after the first half of play,

40:27.959 --> 40:29.961
the score is tied, seven...

40:29.995 --> 40:30.996
Hey, what are
you doing?
Hey.

40:31.029 --> 40:32.631
Come on.
Boo!

40:32.664 --> 40:33.965
Come on.
We need to talk.

40:33.999 --> 40:35.834
Can't it wait
till after the game?

40:35.867 --> 40:37.769
No. My place, my rules.

40:37.803 --> 40:40.105
Uh-oh.
She's using the mom-tone.

40:40.138 --> 40:42.474
Told you we shouldn't
have egged Jake's car.
(sighs)

40:42.508 --> 40:43.642
You what?

40:43.675 --> 40:44.510
JOHN:
To be fair,

40:44.543 --> 40:46.745
you never said
to not do that, so...

40:46.778 --> 40:47.746
Ugh!

40:47.779 --> 40:48.980
Okay, look.

40:49.014 --> 40:51.082
I love you guys,
but this needs to stop.

40:51.116 --> 40:53.819
You can't just show up here
and insert yourselves

40:53.852 --> 40:55.186
into my personal life.

40:55.220 --> 40:57.589
We're not kids anymore.
You're grown men.

40:57.623 --> 40:58.990
Only physically.

40:59.958 --> 41:02.561
Listen, Elle,
you're our little sister.

41:02.594 --> 41:04.229
Being overprotective is
in the big brother description.

41:04.262 --> 41:05.631
That's never gonna change.

41:06.665 --> 41:08.500
Well,

41:08.534 --> 41:11.670
can we at least
come to a compromise?

41:14.840 --> 41:16.241
Uh, we're listening.

41:16.274 --> 41:19.210
I'll agree to be more up front
and open with you,

41:19.244 --> 41:22.113
if you'll agree
to give me my personal space

41:22.147 --> 41:24.115
and trust my decisions.

41:26.652 --> 41:28.820
Okay, we accept
those terms.

41:28.854 --> 41:30.656
(doorbell rings)

41:30.689 --> 41:32.157
Good,

41:32.190 --> 41:34.793
because there's someone
I want you to meet.

41:36.695 --> 41:38.296
Be nice.

41:38.329 --> 41:40.599
ALL:
We're always nice.

41:40.632 --> 41:41.800
Huh.

41:45.036 --> 41:47.072
Hey. (chuckles)

41:47.105 --> 41:50.709
George, John, Robert,

41:50.742 --> 41:52.844
this is Qasim.

41:52.878 --> 41:53.779
My boyfriend.

41:53.812 --> 41:55.246
QASIM:
Hello.

41:55.280 --> 41:57.983
Ellie's told me
so much about you.

42:06.157 --> 42:07.993
Thank God.
We thought it was Gibbs.

42:08.026 --> 42:10.061
(laughter)

42:11.029 --> 42:12.764
(grunts)
