Anita:
Hold still just
a little longer, dear.

01:20.380 --> 01:24.920
Anita!
Stop everything!

01:24.920 --> 01:26.500
-You must design me

01:26.500 --> 01:28.670
the most elegant gown
ever created.

01:28.670 --> 01:30.960
And don't spare the chic.

01:30.960 --> 01:33.000
It's for my wedding.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.120
Cruella,
you're getting married?

01:36.120 --> 01:39.210
-Who's the lucky--
-Victim.

01:39.210 --> 01:43.290
None other than Baron Efrem
Von Schnickerdoodle,

01:43.290 --> 01:47.420
the owner of the largest
schnitzel conglomerate
in the world.

01:47.420 --> 01:51.330
Once married, I will acquire
the Baron's limitless fortune,

01:51.330 --> 01:52.920
his noble title,

01:52.920 --> 01:55.000
his social status,

01:55.000 --> 01:59.080
and move into his fabulous
castle on the Rhine.

01:59.080 --> 02:02.920
That's... just... wonderful.

02:02.920 --> 02:04.920
When did he propose?

02:04.920 --> 02:06.540
As soon as we meet.

02:06.540 --> 02:11.080
Which will be tomorrow
at the Tally-Ho Club's
Annual Foxhunt and Brunch.

02:11.080 --> 02:14.790
But, Cruella,
you're not a member
of the Tally-Ho Club.

02:14.790 --> 02:19.000
Oh, a trifle.
I joined moments ago
and demanded--

02:19.000 --> 02:22.040
uh, offered to host
the foxhunt at Villa De Vil.

02:22.040 --> 02:25.960
Oh, I'm amazed at how
gracious I can be sometimes.

02:25.960 --> 02:28.170
-Oh!
-Ugh.

02:28.170 --> 02:29.750
Oh, one more thing.

02:29.750 --> 02:31.880
My cook quit again
this morning.

02:31.880 --> 02:34.460
I'd like to borrow Ninny
to prepare the brunch.

02:34.460 --> 02:36.120
That's Nanny.

02:36.120 --> 02:37.330
No one cares, dear.

02:37.330 --> 02:39.500
Feed her lots of fiber.

02:39.500 --> 02:41.420
Hmph.

02:49.880 --> 02:52.000
Hey, look at that.

02:53.540 --> 02:55.500
Something's going on
at Cruella's.

02:55.500 --> 02:58.040
Come on, you guys.
Let's check it out.

03:09.540 --> 03:11.330
Oh, do hurry up.

03:11.330 --> 03:13.830
The guests will be
arriving any minute.

03:13.830 --> 03:16.540
Horace, Jasper,
are the animals ready?

03:16.540 --> 03:19.500
Yes, ma'am.
We rented the fastest
riding horses.

03:19.500 --> 03:22.380
Oh! Hey!

03:23.960 --> 03:27.580
Not to mention the finest
hunting dogs and the bestest
fox in the county.

03:29.500 --> 03:31.210
Oh, excellent.

03:31.210 --> 03:33.620
I want everything to be perfect

03:33.620 --> 03:37.830
when my future husband,
Baron Von Schnickerdoodle
arrives.

03:37.830 --> 03:39.580
Hey, hear that?

03:39.580 --> 03:43.540
If Cruella marries
that Baron guy, maybe she'll
move away for good.

03:45.920 --> 03:48.460
Ah! The Tally-Ho Club.

03:53.540 --> 03:55.960
Welcome, Ms. Linkmeyer.

04:01.790 --> 04:04.790
Oh, Mr. Mayor.

04:04.790 --> 04:08.960
Somebody ought to tell
these people to loosen up.
Huh, Rollly?

04:08.960 --> 04:10.580
-Spot: Uh-oh.

04:10.580 --> 04:13.080
Rampaging Rolly-dozer
at three o'clock.

04:13.080 --> 04:16.750
Lucky:
Man, his stomach's
gonna get us all in trouble.

04:16.750 --> 04:19.920
Whoa, papa!

04:23.380 --> 04:25.000
Uh-oh.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.670
Oh, look.

04:26.670 --> 04:29.420
A cheeseball,
my favorite.

04:34.120 --> 04:37.460
Mm, Gruyère,
I do believe.

04:37.460 --> 04:41.540
With just a hint of...
flea dip.

04:44.540 --> 04:45.710
He's arrived!

04:54.830 --> 04:58.380
Welcome,
Baron Von Schnickerdoodle.

05:03.750 --> 05:05.750
Can I get you anything?

05:05.750 --> 05:07.670
A drink

05:07.670 --> 05:08.790
Oxygen?

05:08.790 --> 05:12.290
Memo to myself:
Make this a short engagement.

05:13.830 --> 05:17.080
Ah, I see you've all
met my valet, Jeeves.

05:18.040 --> 05:21.380
Oh, his valet!

05:23.620 --> 05:25.880
Baron Von Schnickerdoodle!

05:25.880 --> 05:28.380
I've heard so much
about you.

05:28.380 --> 05:32.790
I'm Cruella de Vil,
of the Grutely de Vils.

05:32.790 --> 05:36.710
Yes. Well, I'm honored
to be here, Fraulein de Vil.

05:36.710 --> 05:40.670
You know, I met my
last three wives on foxhunts.

05:40.670 --> 05:43.710
Oh, really? I hadn't heard.

05:43.710 --> 05:47.540
Note to myself:
Book the church and have
the minister on standby.

05:53.750 --> 05:56.500
They're coming back.
Everybody hide.

06:00.750 --> 06:04.790
Now, I'd like to keep
on a tight schedule today,
everyone.

06:04.790 --> 06:06.750
First some tea,

06:06.750 --> 06:07.790
then a ten kilometer run,

06:07.790 --> 06:10.670
more tea,
a hearty meal,

06:10.670 --> 06:12.960
followed by rigorous exercise.

06:12.960 --> 06:16.000
Oh, yes. Exercise.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.380
And tea.

06:17.380 --> 06:20.460
And then, the foxhunt.

06:20.460 --> 06:22.540
It'll be a gas.

06:25.750 --> 06:27.830
Ooh, pardon me.

06:27.830 --> 06:30.920
Must've been that schnitzel
I had for breakfast.

06:33.580 --> 06:35.880
Care for a blueberry muffin?

06:38.290 --> 06:42.460
Mm! These are wunderbar.

06:43.670 --> 06:45.580
Why, thank you.

06:45.580 --> 06:49.330
I stayed up all night
baking my fingers
to the bone.

06:49.330 --> 06:51.120
Hmph!

07:02.330 --> 07:05.790
Oh, no. Not Angelica.

07:05.790 --> 07:09.880
My, what a fine,
strapping Fraulein.

07:09.880 --> 07:13.710
Cruella, dear, I don't know
how you could have forgotten

07:13.710 --> 07:19.790
to send me, the president
of the club, an invitation
to your little party here.

07:19.790 --> 07:22.960
Oh.
Silly me.

07:22.960 --> 07:26.620
I thought you'd be too busy
having your chins lifted.

07:26.620 --> 07:30.290
Oh, you must be
Baron Von Schnickerdoodle.

07:30.290 --> 07:33.040
I'm Miss Angelica.

07:33.040 --> 07:35.210
Marvelous!

07:35.210 --> 07:36.750
Angelica, dear,

07:36.750 --> 07:39.120
why don't you come back
when you can't stay?

07:39.120 --> 07:41.540
Cruella,

07:41.540 --> 07:44.750
Shouldn't you be getting
back to the wax works?

07:46.120 --> 07:48.080
That's saying a lot,

07:48.080 --> 07:50.580
coming from
a silicone squeak toy.

07:59.250 --> 08:03.460
Oh, I just love
a brisk run before
a foxhunt, don't you?

08:03.460 --> 08:05.670
Yes.

08:05.670 --> 08:09.580
That was
most invigorating.

08:09.580 --> 08:11.750
Well, time to rest.

08:11.750 --> 08:14.120
But we've only
run out the door.

08:14.120 --> 08:16.080
You mean, there's more?

08:16.080 --> 08:20.710
Oh, darn, I just remembered
I'm getting my gums scraped
today.

08:21.880 --> 08:25.250
Sorry to keep you waiting,
Baron, darling.

08:25.250 --> 08:27.170
Ready for our run?

08:27.170 --> 08:32.120
That's what I like,
a Fraulein who can
keep up with me.

08:33.290 --> 08:35.420
Oh, what am I thinking?

08:35.420 --> 08:38.040
I had my gums scraped yesterday.

08:38.040 --> 08:40.000
Ready, Baron?

08:40.000 --> 08:41.670
Marvelous!

08:41.670 --> 08:45.380
Last one to the old bridge
is a stinky schnauzer.

08:51.710 --> 08:53.620
She'll never make it.

08:53.620 --> 08:55.670
Cruella's in terrible shape.

08:55.670 --> 08:58.620
We gotta make sure
she gets to that bridge.

09:04.420 --> 09:07.750
Oh, Baron,
this is so much fun.

09:07.750 --> 09:09.540
Right, Cruella?

09:09.540 --> 09:12.500
Yes.

09:12.500 --> 09:16.330
Fun.
Somebody, please, shoot me.

09:21.620 --> 09:25.500
Come on,
we gotta keep up with them.

09:31.290 --> 09:33.380
I told you she
was out of shape.

09:33.380 --> 09:36.830
Phew, and now she doesn't
smell too good, either.

09:36.830 --> 09:38.750
Everybody,
grab hold.

09:38.750 --> 09:41.040
I know a shortcut
through the woods.

09:47.040 --> 09:49.670
Okay, bring her out.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.420
Hello! We can't just
leave her like this.

09:56.420 --> 09:57.830
Well,
let's prop her up.

10:13.380 --> 10:14.620
Huh?

10:14.620 --> 10:16.330
What in the world?

10:16.330 --> 10:17.710
Bravo, Cruella.

10:17.710 --> 10:19.540
That's what I really like,

10:19.540 --> 10:23.000
a Fraulein who's one step
ahead of me.

10:23.000 --> 10:28.540
I don't remember seeing you
pass us on the road,
Cruella, dear.

10:28.540 --> 10:34.830
I guess at your age, your eyes
aren't what they used to be,
Angelica, dear.

10:34.830 --> 10:38.620
Well, time to head back.
I've got a tight schedule today.

10:38.620 --> 10:41.540
Hut, hut, hut.

10:48.420 --> 10:53.380
Nanny, this boiled radish
and pickle sauce is superb.

10:53.380 --> 10:57.420
I like a Fraulein who knows
her way around the radish.

10:57.420 --> 10:59.170
Mm.

10:59.170 --> 11:03.250
Nipsy, why don't you
go curdle a carrot
or something?

11:03.250 --> 11:05.960
Here, Baron,
have a bitesy

11:09.330 --> 11:11.620
You can eat later,
Baron, darling.

11:11.620 --> 11:13.620
Let's talk horses.

11:13.620 --> 11:16.290
Oofsa.

11:16.290 --> 11:18.960
Talk is cheap
and so is Angelica.

11:18.960 --> 11:20.460
Strudel?

11:31.080 --> 11:32.580
Ooh.

11:35.460 --> 11:38.500
Oh, I think this is
uncalled for, don't you?

11:39.620 --> 11:41.880
This is bad.

11:41.880 --> 11:43.670
Quick, follow me.

11:43.670 --> 11:46.330
Oh! Oh!

11:46.330 --> 11:49.290
Oh!

11:52.210 --> 11:53.580
What fun, Cruella!

12:14.830 --> 12:16.330
Huh?

12:17.460 --> 12:21.080
I'll take that
to Baron Von Schnickerdoodle.

12:23.620 --> 12:27.080
Cruella, dear,
you seem a little pressed.

12:29.830 --> 12:31.330
Allow me.

12:33.330 --> 12:35.420
We gotta do something!

12:35.420 --> 12:37.210
Hey.

12:37.210 --> 12:39.880
Let's keep Angelica on a roll.

12:39.880 --> 12:42.460
One, two, three!

12:44.420 --> 12:46.830
Huh? Oh! Oof!

12:51.500 --> 12:52.500
Ahh!

12:56.330 --> 12:59.080
Oh, my new dental work.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.500
I've brought your tea
and crumpets.

13:13.500 --> 13:15.500
Danke schoen, Fraulein.

13:15.500 --> 13:17.830
I'm so looking forward
to today's hunt.

13:17.830 --> 13:22.170
There's something about
a Fraulein who can catch
a fox, yeah?

13:22.170 --> 13:24.250
My favorite pastime.

13:24.250 --> 13:27.540
Just hand me a rod and reel
and let me at him.

13:27.540 --> 13:31.250
Hmm. I'm afraid
she's gonna need
major help.

13:31.250 --> 13:33.420
This calls for
some atmosphere.

13:33.420 --> 13:34.960
Rolly, hit the blinds.

13:34.960 --> 13:38.170
Prepare for liftoff.

13:52.420 --> 13:53.790
Phew.

13:54.790 --> 13:57.830
-Ah, what is--

14:01.830 --> 14:04.380
Ah, amor.

14:06.250 --> 14:09.460
Ah, crumpets!

14:10.710 --> 14:12.420
Highly unusual.

14:17.330 --> 14:19.210
Oh, doodle-strudel,

14:19.210 --> 14:21.500
your touch is enchanting.

14:26.670 --> 14:28.460
What a kisser.

14:30.500 --> 14:34.210
Ugh, now I'm gonna need
all new shots.

14:38.830 --> 14:42.380
You can't get rid of me
that easily.

14:42.380 --> 14:44.710
Ha! You're too late.

14:44.710 --> 14:47.170
We've kissed
and it was magic.

14:47.170 --> 14:51.040
It may have tasted like kibble,
but it was still magic.

14:51.040 --> 14:55.080
Look, sister,
it ain't over
till it's over.

14:55.080 --> 14:57.170
Give it up, Angelica.

14:57.170 --> 15:00.250
I'll be married
right after the foxhunt.

15:00.250 --> 15:01.960
Oh, really?

15:01.960 --> 15:04.750
And with what
are you planning to hunt?

15:04.750 --> 15:08.790
No!

15:08.790 --> 15:12.170
Oops. Your fox and hounds
are gone.

15:12.170 --> 15:14.880
Tsk-tsk-tsk. Aw.

15:16.540 --> 15:21.170
Oh. Nobody said
this is gonna be easy.

15:26.880 --> 15:32.040
This is a state of emergency.
We need everyone to come
with us and help Cruella.

15:32.040 --> 15:34.380
Oh, whoa, whoa.
Hold it right there, honey.

15:34.380 --> 15:36.880
Did you say, "help Cruella"?

15:36.880 --> 15:38.580
It's not what you think.

15:38.580 --> 15:42.750
If we work together,
we can get rid of Cruella
once and for all.

15:42.750 --> 15:44.080
Hm.

15:44.080 --> 15:45.920
I have to think
about that one.

15:51.170 --> 15:53.330
Well, if there's not going
to be a hunt,

15:53.330 --> 15:55.710
I might as well
be skedaddling.

15:55.710 --> 15:58.040
I quite agree, Baron.

15:58.040 --> 16:00.670
You know,
I just happen to have

16:00.670 --> 16:05.120
a stable full of horses
and hounds back at my place.

16:06.210 --> 16:09.580
Horses and hounds?
Sounds like a plan.

16:09.580 --> 16:10.880
No!

16:10.880 --> 16:13.290
Oh, don't beg,
Cruella, dear.

16:13.290 --> 16:15.210
You're embarrassing yourself.

16:19.790 --> 16:21.920
What is the meaning
of this?

16:23.420 --> 16:25.710
Why, what a wonderful idea.

16:25.710 --> 16:28.080
A foxhunt
on livestock.

16:28.080 --> 16:32.210
What? Oh, yes, yes. Of course.

16:32.210 --> 16:34.080
My little surprise.

16:34.080 --> 16:38.040
Cruella, darling, I think
you've forgotten something.

16:38.040 --> 16:40.120
What are we supposed
to be chasing?

16:40.120 --> 16:42.460
Oh, uh...

16:42.460 --> 16:44.170
Cruella:
Oh...

16:45.540 --> 16:47.040
Huh

16:53.960 --> 16:57.040
Get that chicken!

17:07.040 --> 17:11.290
Why? Why is it always
the chicken?

17:18.790 --> 17:20.670
Ooh! Ugh!

17:25.170 --> 17:27.120
Oh.

17:31.210 --> 17:33.580
She's got to be
around here someplace.

17:37.620 --> 17:40.120
I think we found Spot.

17:41.250 --> 17:43.960
-Spot: I don't
want to go!

17:43.960 --> 17:45.120
Ah!

17:45.120 --> 17:49.120
Look, Spot, all you
have to do is let
Cruella catch you.

17:49.120 --> 17:51.000
Oh, yeah, sure.

17:51.000 --> 17:54.540
Why don't I just
play on the highway, too,
while I'm at it.

17:54.540 --> 17:56.620
Come on, you won't
get hurt.

17:56.620 --> 18:00.210
And think of the noble deed
you'll be doing for everyone
on the farm.

18:00.210 --> 18:03.080
You'll be the one who
got rid of Cruella.

18:03.080 --> 18:06.000
A hero, a poultry legend.

18:07.620 --> 18:09.920
Oh, all right.

18:09.920 --> 18:11.120
Here she comes.

18:11.120 --> 18:13.670
Okay, Spot,
just hold still.

18:13.670 --> 18:17.960
Slow down, you bloated
farmy thing.

18:17.960 --> 18:20.080
Tally-ho!

18:23.960 --> 18:29.250
Hey, go back, you stupid cow!
There's the chicken!

18:34.000 --> 18:37.790
Yeah, could I get one
with mustard?

18:37.790 --> 18:40.380
This jacket's too tight.

18:40.380 --> 18:42.540
Don't worry,
you're looking good.

18:42.540 --> 18:44.120
Think positive.

18:44.120 --> 18:45.750
You can be caught.

18:45.750 --> 18:47.000
Solid.

18:47.000 --> 18:50.830
Stop it with the bouncing
and the running
and the bouncing.

18:50.830 --> 18:53.960
Aha! I've got that chicken now.

18:53.960 --> 18:55.170
Ah!

18:55.170 --> 18:57.830
Oh, no. Angelica's
gonna get her.

18:57.830 --> 19:00.460
Stop!

19:07.960 --> 19:09.000
Oh, dear.

19:14.960 --> 19:16.330
Phew.

19:16.330 --> 19:19.880
Get that feathered beast.
Schnell, schnell, schnell!

19:22.880 --> 19:25.620
Am I being punished
for something?

19:26.670 --> 19:28.080
Get back here!

19:28.080 --> 19:30.250
Don't you order me
around, you old bat.

19:30.250 --> 19:33.380
Who are you calling old,
you fossil face?

19:33.380 --> 19:34.960
I'm a fossil face?

19:40.120 --> 19:42.880
No one's going to win
this hunt but me!

19:42.880 --> 19:45.920
Then you'll have to do it
without a cow to ride.

19:45.920 --> 19:48.620
Get going, you mangy mammal.

19:57.120 --> 19:59.330
Oh, I smeared my lipstick.

20:00.460 --> 20:03.620
Poultry off the port bow,
charge!

20:03.620 --> 20:06.040
Cruella:
Here, chick, chick.

20:06.040 --> 20:08.460
Oh, where is that
blasted chicken?

20:08.460 --> 20:11.460
Time for a new strategy. Run!

20:11.460 --> 20:15.040
Haha! I caught the chicken.

20:15.040 --> 20:18.580
Tally-ho!
Whoa!

20:21.960 --> 20:25.250
Patooey! Wunderbar foxhunt.

20:25.250 --> 20:27.210
Ooh.

20:29.920 --> 20:33.830
There, there.
Have some more broth, hm?

20:33.830 --> 20:36.080
You had a nasty fall.

20:38.420 --> 20:42.790
Schnicky-wicky,
I was so worried
about you.

20:44.080 --> 20:46.460
And you, too,
Angelica.

20:47.710 --> 20:50.250
Here's some bricks
for your new patio.

20:56.210 --> 20:57.790
As you've probably heard,

20:57.790 --> 20:59.920
I'm the one
who caught the fox.

20:59.920 --> 21:03.000
Uh, the chicken.
And don't worry, dearest,

21:03.000 --> 21:05.670
the chaplain's on his way.

21:05.670 --> 21:07.750
Actually, you've
given me an idea.

21:07.750 --> 21:09.250
All right!

21:09.250 --> 21:13.460
I'd like Nanny to be
my Frau Schnickerdoodle.

21:13.460 --> 21:15.420
What?

21:17.040 --> 21:20.880
When I tasted your boiled
radish and pickle sauce,

21:20.880 --> 21:24.000
I knew you were
the Fraulein for me.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.500
Oh, that's very kind.

21:26.500 --> 21:27.750
But I just can't.

21:27.750 --> 21:32.380
No, someone has
to take care of Roger and Anita
and all those puppies.

21:32.380 --> 21:35.120
Oh, well, maybe
it's all for the best.

21:35.120 --> 21:37.920
Could you boil me
some radishes to go?

21:39.120 --> 21:42.500
Nobody kisses Cruella
and stays a bachelor!

21:44.880 --> 21:48.250
I can't believe
I actually kissed her.

21:48.250 --> 21:52.500
I'll never get that taste
off my lips. The horror!

21:52.500 --> 21:54.620
The horror!

21:56.210 --> 21:58.420
Say, have you
seen Spot?

21:59.790 --> 22:01.670
Man:
Tally-ho!

22:01.670 --> 22:04.670
Go away! Ah!
Leave me alone!

22:04.670 --> 22:07.210
Who wants to chase a chicken?

22:07.210 --> 22:09.790
There's hardly any white meat
on me anyways!

22:09.790 --> 22:12.670
Bawk! I've got salmonella!
