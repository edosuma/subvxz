00:04.429 --> 00:09.936
There was something about those
doors that I did not like.

00:09.937 --> 00:15.037
I was conscious of this
feeling of being watched.

00:15.084 --> 00:16.542
Who's there?

00:16.543 --> 00:19.979
I remember feeling kind of sick..
Sick with, like, a fear.

00:19.980 --> 00:22.800
Mom, is that you?

00:23.884 --> 00:28.977
I started to say to myself, there
might be something otherworldly

00:28.978 --> 00:30.670
going on in my own home.

00:30.671 --> 00:32.381
Mom!

00:32.381 --> 00:34.538
It sounded like it was
moving across the ceiling.

00:34.539 --> 00:35.789
It's back.

00:35.790 --> 00:41.430
There was, like, this angry
woman just pushing in on me.

00:41.923 --> 00:45.343
You're not leaving, right?

00:45.753 --> 00:49.293
We were absolutely terrified.

00:50.913 --> 00:54.453
What in the world was that?

00:56.000 --> 01:02.074

01:09.159 --> 01:15.059
We looked for quite a while for some
sort of house that would fit our budget.

01:18.291 --> 01:22.978
We had two daughters, so it was
about time for us to expand.

01:22.979 --> 01:26.482
We were thinking, this has to be the one.

01:26.483 --> 01:29.685
This is our last resort.
This is the one that we can make our own.

01:29.686 --> 01:31.792
It doesn't matter what the inside is like.

01:31.793 --> 01:35.873
We're gonna.. We're gonna do this.

01:37.694 --> 01:40.996
We were exceedingly happy moving in here.

01:40.997 --> 01:45.400
It was just wonderful, because we
got to leave our little apartment

01:45.401 --> 01:48.704
and the kids had their own rooms.

01:48.705 --> 01:52.074
So it was with a lot of
hope that we moved in here.

01:52.075 --> 01:54.519
What do I tell my sister?

01:54.520 --> 01:56.979
She's already put a down
payment on the house.

01:56.980 --> 01:58.926
She's really excited.

01:58.927 --> 02:00.858
The price is right.

02:00.859 --> 02:04.939
There's room enough for her family.

02:05.622 --> 02:11.021
But I felt something odd or
disturbing in that house.

02:14.064 --> 02:19.669
So I had a hard time saying, you
know, I wouldn't if I were you.

02:19.670 --> 02:24.045
But that.. That was my intense feeling
about it, that I wouldn't if I were you.

02:24.046 --> 02:29.609
Whatever the price was, because I felt
some thing, some unusual thing, was..

02:29.610 --> 02:34.170
Attached to the house in some strange way.

02:42.843 --> 02:45.174
Girls, do you really
have to do that in here?

02:45.175 --> 02:46.362
Please, take it upstairs, okay?

02:46.363 --> 02:50.341
When we first got there, Karen and
Christine were just absolutely overjoyed.

02:50.342 --> 02:51.701
Seriously, girls!

02:51.702 --> 02:53.380
They were running around
chasing each other.

02:53.381 --> 02:55.404
They were going up and down the stairs.

03:01.514 --> 03:03.741
In the basement, we had Karen's room.

03:03.742 --> 03:04.765
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, Mom.

03:04.766 --> 03:07.587
Don't forget, Joanna's coming to
pick you up at 4:00 for rehearsal.

03:07.588 --> 03:10.272
I know. Don't worry.

03:10.273 --> 03:16.173
And my husband and I decided to put
our washer and dryer down there.

03:18.397 --> 03:23.418
And as I'm doing the laundry, I really
started paying attention to these doors.

03:23.419 --> 03:26.574
They were about five feet above the ground.

03:26.575 --> 03:30.609
And I wondered why they were in
such an odd position on the wall.

03:30.610 --> 03:33.137
I knew that part of the..

03:33.138 --> 03:36.565
Unfinished, undug-up
basement was behind them.

03:36.566 --> 03:39.601
But I did not want to explore them.

03:39.602 --> 03:41.706
I didn't open them..

03:41.707 --> 03:42.961
Ever.

03:42.962 --> 03:45.941
It just seemed like a strange area to me.

03:45.942 --> 03:47.662
Like, what were the doors for?

03:47.663 --> 03:50.313
I mean, you know, you're
not going in there.

03:50.314 --> 03:55.635
The feeling near those doors and
around those doors was uneasy.

03:55.636 --> 03:59.633
I was conscious of this
feeling of being watched.

03:59.634 --> 04:03.086
It was if something was right by my back..

04:03.087 --> 04:06.267
Just right by my back.

04:25.949 --> 04:29.175
The basement was a creepy place to be.

04:29.176 --> 04:31.507
- Are you ready?
- Uh, yeah.

04:31.508 --> 04:35.931
It was kind of uneasy.
I remember not wanting to be there alone.

04:35.932 --> 04:39.832
You have to go open those doors.

04:41.597 --> 04:45.868
The dirt room was at the far
wall of the laundry room.

04:45.869 --> 04:47.597
Go on.

04:47.598 --> 04:52.470
And I remember my Mother telling
us not to go into the dirt room.

04:52.471 --> 04:54.631
Just go.

04:55.345 --> 04:59.743
It was a completely unsafe room.
Nobody really knew why it was there.

04:59.744 --> 05:05.504
But I remember my Mom telling
me distinctly to not go in.

05:05.687 --> 05:09.947
And I remember completely ignoring her.

05:16.432 --> 05:21.052
See? Those are the doors I told you about.

05:22.873 --> 05:25.980
I dare you to go in.

05:25.981 --> 05:28.043
No. You go in.

05:28.044 --> 05:30.557
I'm not going. I dared you first.

05:30.558 --> 05:33.498
You have to do it.

05:37.053 --> 05:39.093
Go in.

05:39.289 --> 05:41.449
Just go!

05:42.792 --> 05:44.360
It's no big deal.

05:44.361 --> 05:48.518
It was very dark, and
it felt very peculiar.

05:48.519 --> 05:53.046
It.. You know, it felt wrong, and we just..

05:53.047 --> 05:56.947
We kind of spooked ourselves out.

06:00.277 --> 06:03.864
- You're not leaving, right?
- No. I'm right here.

06:03.865 --> 06:05.785
Okay.

06:06.916 --> 06:09.970
We would jump onto the cupboard.

06:09.971 --> 06:12.754
And then you had to crawl inside.

06:12.755 --> 06:15.048
It wasn't a large room,
so you could not stand.

06:15.049 --> 06:16.757
You could only crawl.

06:16.758 --> 06:19.818
It was a soil floor.

06:20.297 --> 06:24.737
There was nothing in that room but dirt.

06:26.469 --> 06:28.737
It smelled earthy.

06:28.738 --> 06:32.338
It was a little decay smell.

06:34.677 --> 06:36.932
It was damp.

06:36.933 --> 06:39.573
It smelled old.

06:39.748 --> 06:43.687
I was too nervous to go all
the way into the dirt room.

06:43.688 --> 06:47.708
I never made it to the back wall.

06:50.126 --> 06:52.301
- Mom!
- Mom, Mom, come here!

06:52.302 --> 06:56.429
I was in my kitchen, and the
children were just playing.

06:56.430 --> 06:58.202
They were.. They were full of dirt.

06:58.203 --> 07:00.464
And then they told me that
they had been exploring.

07:00.465 --> 07:02.804
I told you I didn't want
you playing in there.

07:02.805 --> 07:05.910
I was very upset.
I did not want them in there.

07:05.911 --> 07:07.335
How many times do I have to tell you?

07:07.336 --> 07:10.179
There was something about those
doors that I did not like.

07:10.180 --> 07:12.948
I didn't want to be near them.
I didn't want my children near them.

07:12.949 --> 07:16.447
It felt like those doors
were supposed to be shut.

07:16.448 --> 07:19.082
I said, close the doors, and
don't go in there again.

07:19.083 --> 07:22.157
Get upstairs, both of you. Let's go.

07:22.158 --> 07:28.058
I think she thought opening the dirt room
might somehow be inviting something.

07:32.716 --> 07:34.128
It was an amazing house.

07:34.129 --> 07:37.202
It was old, and it was charming, and it had

07:37.203 --> 07:39.581
so many good things about it that the last

07:39.582 --> 07:42.518
thing I wanted to think was
that there was anything..

07:42.519 --> 07:46.539
Untoward or negative in this house.

07:53.537 --> 07:55.195
I was in the kitchen.

07:55.196 --> 07:57.563
I'm the only one in the house.

07:57.564 --> 08:02.784
And I heard footsteps going down..
Down the stairs.

08:07.913 --> 08:13.193
I had left the kitchen, and
I went around to look.

08:22.569 --> 08:28.389
There's no one there.
I'm saying, okay, I heard footsteps.

08:36.347 --> 08:38.807
Who's there?

08:46.690 --> 08:49.388
When I heard the steps
going down the basement,

08:49.389 --> 08:52.068
I left the kitchen, and I went to look.

08:52.069 --> 08:54.292
And there was just
absolutely nothing there.

08:54.293 --> 08:56.397
Nothing. And I heard them distinctly.

08:56.398 --> 08:59.466
Maybe seven or eight steps going down
the stairs, and there was nothing..

08:59.467 --> 09:02.707
Absolutely nothing there.

09:07.711 --> 09:09.717
It feels like when I was in..

09:09.718 --> 09:14.938
When I was in the house
alone, I was never alone.

09:15.386 --> 09:19.038
It felt like there was something
else there, something else with me.

09:19.039 --> 09:22.136
Something always right here.

09:22.137 --> 09:25.437
Right behind me, looking.

09:33.142 --> 09:38.422
It's.. It's really uncomfortable
to experience that.

09:41.818 --> 09:45.025
I remember being in my living
room and just hearing..

09:45.026 --> 09:46.886
Mom.

09:48.858 --> 09:50.838
Mommy.

09:51.644 --> 09:54.954
And I'd go, did you call me?
And Christine said, no, you called me.

09:54.955 --> 09:58.195
No, I didn't call you.

09:59.130 --> 10:01.350
Christine.

10:01.798 --> 10:04.234
Can you hear that?

10:04.235 --> 10:08.554
Out of nowhere, coming from what sounded
like it came from the basement door.

10:08.555 --> 10:11.598
I heard my name shouted.

10:11.599 --> 10:14.605
Um, and then this kind of maniacal..

10:14.606 --> 10:17.786
Laughter came after it.

10:20.117 --> 10:23.086
I think it's coming from down there.

10:23.087 --> 10:25.388
The laughter was very scary.

10:25.389 --> 10:28.329
It's okay, Sweetie.

10:29.660 --> 10:33.347
Me and my Mother instantly froze.

10:33.348 --> 10:35.665
I asked her if she heard it.
She asked me if I heard it.

10:35.666 --> 10:37.033
I said, yes.

10:37.034 --> 10:39.254
Christine.

10:40.571 --> 10:42.872
Don't go there.

10:42.873 --> 10:45.684
- Mommy, don't go.
- Christine.

10:45.685 --> 10:48.372
- Christine.
- Mommy, what is that?

10:48.373 --> 10:49.779
I don't know, Sweetie.

10:49.780 --> 10:51.847
It sounded evil.

10:51.848 --> 10:54.226
Chris.. Christine.

10:54.227 --> 10:56.987
It sounded scary.

10:58.655 --> 11:02.675
It sounded mocking. It sounded um..

11:03.309 --> 11:05.229
Mean.

11:17.954 --> 11:20.174
Christine.

11:21.213 --> 11:23.433
Christine.

11:27.665 --> 11:31.456
I remember my heart beating.
I remember a sinking feeling in my stomach.

11:31.457 --> 11:35.297
I remember feeling kind of sick..

11:35.298 --> 11:37.696
Sick with, like, a fear.

11:37.697 --> 11:42.797
And I was frozen, which was..
I was just frozen.

11:42.869 --> 11:45.089
Christine.

11:46.505 --> 11:49.942
We had both heard my name.
We both heard the laughter.

11:49.943 --> 11:53.483
We were extremely frightened.

11:53.546 --> 11:56.006
Who's there?

12:00.954 --> 12:05.398
I think..
I don't know what I thought it was.

12:05.399 --> 12:09.469
The house started becoming
seriously uncomfortable.

12:09.470 --> 12:13.131
Not all the time.
For periods of time, it would become..

12:13.132 --> 12:17.812
It started getting
increasingly uncomfortable.

13:07.551 --> 13:11.091
One night, I felt something push me.

13:11.092 --> 13:13.372
A weight..

13:13.516 --> 13:18.796
Pushed my chest, pushed my
whole body into the bed.

13:19.060 --> 13:23.320
And I remember feeling this sense of..

13:26.254 --> 13:28.414
Pressure.

13:33.021 --> 13:34.991
I could feel the springs in the bed go down

13:34.992 --> 13:38.984
so that I was actually
being pushed like this.

13:38.985 --> 13:41.053
I couldn't scream for help.

13:41.054 --> 13:44.281
I absolutely was rendered..

13:44.282 --> 13:47.162
Completely helpless.

14:04.143 --> 14:07.979
I had absolutely no idea
what was happening.

14:07.980 --> 14:12.261
- What's going on?
- I had a nightmare.

14:12.262 --> 14:15.202
Turn the light off.

14:19.322 --> 14:23.361
Now I started having suffocating dreams.
I mean, I..

14:23.362 --> 14:26.998
I really started to question if I was okay.

14:26.999 --> 14:30.783
I would have some nights where
they happened all night long.

14:30.784 --> 14:33.364
And I would have to get up and
just walk around the house.

14:33.365 --> 14:36.958
And not know what to do,
because if I lie down..

14:36.959 --> 14:40.378
This was gonna happen to me again.

14:40.379 --> 14:46.279
There were times when I had to go
to work at 7:00 in the morning.

14:46.320 --> 14:51.900
As an emergency room nurse.
And I hadn't slept at all.

14:53.092 --> 14:56.501
And if someone said to me, what's wrong?

14:56.502 --> 14:59.420
How could I possibly say
to anyone at work..

14:59.421 --> 15:03.077
You know, I think something is pushing me

15:03.078 --> 15:07.818
into the bed at night, and I can't see it.

15:09.475 --> 15:12.644
She would never know when it would happen.

15:12.645 --> 15:15.113
She certainly didn't know
why it would happen.

15:15.114 --> 15:18.174
It would just happen.

15:21.387 --> 15:26.057
I can only imagine, you know, that
that's a really awful feeling.

15:26.058 --> 15:29.298
I know it affected her.

15:31.840 --> 15:35.374
I didn't really understand why..
You know, why was I..

15:35.375 --> 15:38.543
Experiencing something
that would indicate..

15:38.544 --> 15:42.976
Some sort of emotional issue on my part?

15:42.977 --> 15:48.497
So I kept trying to understand
what was wrong with me.

15:48.884 --> 15:52.544
And I didn't have an answer.

16:35.962 --> 16:39.364
I was in the kitchen, and I hear

16:39.365 --> 16:42.321
Karen saying very loudly..

16:42.322 --> 16:44.542
Mom? Mom!

16:46.362 --> 16:47.491
Mom!

16:47.492 --> 16:51.676
And as I open the door to her
room, she's sitting in her bed.

16:51.677 --> 16:53.245
- And she's just going, ma..
- Mom!

16:53.246 --> 16:55.513
- And I'm looking..
- Mom, look!

16:55.514 --> 17:01.034
And I can see the quilt was
being pulled off the bed.

17:01.977 --> 17:05.957
Come here! You're all right. Come on.

17:05.958 --> 17:08.292
I remember running down to the basement,

17:08.294 --> 17:12.829
and her blanket was laid
out in a perfect square.

17:12.830 --> 17:15.800
I stood in the door in disbelief.

17:15.800 --> 17:17.269
You're all right?

17:17.270 --> 17:18.869
I don't know. It just started moving.

17:18.871 --> 17:23.310
I was like, what in the world was that?

17:25.357 --> 17:31.257
It still is one of the strangest
things I've ever witnessed in my life.

17:32.952 --> 17:35.423
The basement of that house..

17:35.424 --> 17:38.746
Started feeling more and more..

17:38.747 --> 17:41.126
Uncomfortable.

17:41.127 --> 17:43.761
It was disconcerting to just go down there.

17:43.762 --> 17:48.982
The feeling was that it was
inhabited by something.

17:55.341 --> 18:00.947
Many nights, I would find Karen sleeping
on the couch in the living room.

18:00.948 --> 18:06.681
I didn't what her.. I didn't want
anyone down in that basement any more.

18:06.682 --> 18:07.713
You okay, Sweetie?

18:07.714 --> 18:10.388
Oh, yeah, I just didn't want
to sleep downstairs any more.

18:10.389 --> 18:12.849
That's okay.

18:19.859 --> 18:23.734
The phenomena were kind of building up.
And uh..

18:23.735 --> 18:26.671
I think it got to the point
where we couldn't ignore it.

18:26.672 --> 18:30.796
And I think we were starting to
pay more and more attention to..

18:30.797 --> 18:35.958
To connecting the different
phenomena that were occurring.

18:35.959 --> 18:38.916
It became patently obvious that something

18:38.917 --> 18:43.897
that was beyond normal
explanation was going on.

18:44.457 --> 18:48.374
Something was wrong.
Something was very wrong.

18:48.375 --> 18:52.230
I started to say to myself,
I have to open up my mind

18:52.231 --> 18:55.903
to think that there might be something..

18:55.904 --> 18:59.237
Otherworldly going on in my own home.

18:59.238 --> 19:04.058
And this was a really
difficult thought for me.

19:04.059 --> 19:09.099
Things were happening and
increasing incrementally.

19:12.084 --> 19:15.864
I was awakened by a loud bang.

19:21.955 --> 19:24.996
So I go look.
I'm looking around to see what fell.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.364
Did anything fall?

19:26.365 --> 19:28.866
Karen had also gotten up. So had Christine.

19:28.867 --> 19:31.687
Mom? Is that you?

19:35.001 --> 19:36.057
Mom?

19:36.058 --> 19:39.221
It sounded like someone went
from the back of the house

19:39.222 --> 19:42.088
to the front of the house stomping.

19:42.089 --> 19:44.909
No, it's not me.

19:47.153 --> 19:51.189
And it went boom, boom, boom, and stopped.

19:51.190 --> 19:53.950
Boom! Boom! Stop.

20:06.753 --> 20:09.232
I remember being on the bed.

20:09.233 --> 20:11.873
Very frightened.

20:13.904 --> 20:18.146
It was scary for me to see
my Mom so frightened.

20:18.147 --> 20:20.192
Mommy, someone's upstairs.

20:20.193 --> 20:23.109
It sounded like it was
moving across the ceiling.

20:23.110 --> 20:26.500
But no one's upstairs.
We know no one is upstairs.

20:26.501 --> 20:29.269
My husband had left for work.
What was this?

20:29.270 --> 20:30.403
It's okay.

20:30.404 --> 20:31.781
There's someone there.

20:31.782 --> 20:34.475
I'm gonna call your Father right now, okay?

20:34.476 --> 20:38.796
We were absolutely, absolutely terrified.

20:39.514 --> 20:43.316
We left the house and sat on the stoop.

20:43.317 --> 20:45.213
My husband drove up.

20:45.214 --> 20:46.263
What now?

20:46.264 --> 20:48.394
I didn't want to call you, but
there's something in the house

20:48.395 --> 20:50.330
making this really loud noise upstairs.

20:50.331 --> 20:53.603
We tried to describe these bangs that
we heard, and he said something like..

20:53.604 --> 20:56.229
Something more like, more of this nonsense?
And he was gonna leave.

20:56.230 --> 20:58.208
And we said, no, no, no,
really, you have to see.

20:58.209 --> 21:00.771
- It could be the plumbing.
- It's not plumbing.

21:00.772 --> 21:04.012
Let's go check it out.

21:29.019 --> 21:31.031
There's nothing here, Elaine.

21:31.032 --> 21:32.714
Nothing.

21:32.715 --> 21:35.913
Okay? You know what this is?
This is ridiculous.

21:35.914 --> 21:37.638
This is nonsense.

21:37.639 --> 21:41.359
This is more of your nonsense.

21:41.932 --> 21:44.912
Girls, look after your Mother.

21:44.913 --> 21:48.616
- Seriously, something..
- And as we came down,

21:48.617 --> 21:51.062
- and he was about to go to work..
- I checked everywhere, Elaine.

21:51.063 --> 21:55.143
It happened again. Boom, boom, boom!

21:57.837 --> 22:00.139
He heard it, and he said..

22:00.140 --> 22:02.659
I got to go to work.

22:02.660 --> 22:04.437
Really nice.

22:04.438 --> 22:09.002
I think her husband dismissed
things because he didn't see them.

22:09.003 --> 22:12.309
And I feel he is just the kind of person,

22:12.310 --> 22:15.561
that doesn't notice those kinds of things.

22:15.562 --> 22:19.120
To see it would mean that we
were right and he was wrong.

22:19.121 --> 22:20.506
I.. You know, I don't know.

22:20.507 --> 22:23.303
But he.. He just couldn't..
He couldn't or wouldn't..

22:23.304 --> 22:25.404
See it.

22:26.702 --> 22:29.557
At a certain point, the marriage did..

22:29.558 --> 22:32.738
You know, did dissolve.

22:33.250 --> 22:35.431
My husband still refused to,

22:35.432 --> 22:39.009
see that this was maybe more
than meets the eye, that it..

22:39.010 --> 22:42.526
To let room in that this
could be something..

22:42.527 --> 22:45.887
Um, of an unknown origin.

22:52.299 --> 22:55.351
I changed things around, repainted.

22:55.352 --> 22:56.491
Watch out, Mom.

22:56.492 --> 23:00.607
And I just noticed without those
arguments, without the negativity,

23:00.608 --> 23:05.258
it seemed like the place
was full of light again.

23:05.259 --> 23:09.546
Things felt completely
settled, completely normal.

23:09.547 --> 23:12.065
My sister was in the process
of moving into the attic.

23:12.066 --> 23:14.627
And we were cleaning out the back room.

23:14.628 --> 23:16.637
Have you ever been in there?

23:16.638 --> 23:20.456
Um, no, I don't think we're
supposed to go in there.

23:20.457 --> 23:24.177
There was a door in the wall.

23:24.183 --> 23:30.083
And you could kind of walk into the
other room kind of behind the wall.

23:34.497 --> 23:38.419
It kind of felt like a cubby
hole or, like, under the stairs.

23:38.420 --> 23:40.522
Something very small and enclosed.

23:40.523 --> 23:43.636
Hey, there's a bunch of cool stuff in here.

23:43.637 --> 23:45.414
Oh, really?

23:45.415 --> 23:47.750
Yeah, I think I found something.

23:47.751 --> 23:50.631
Why? What's there?

23:51.285 --> 23:52.304
What is that?

23:52.305 --> 23:54.400
And all the way buried in the back..

23:54.401 --> 23:56.030
I think it's a package.

23:56.031 --> 23:58.907
We came across this kind of older,

23:58.908 --> 24:01.235
looking cardboard box that was taped shut.

24:01.236 --> 24:03.037
- Come look what we found!
- Mom, come here!

24:03.038 --> 24:04.626
And we opened it up.

24:04.627 --> 24:07.567
Look what we found!

24:08.031 --> 24:09.445
What do you have there?

24:09.446 --> 24:11.606
Open it.

24:12.147 --> 24:16.881
And when they brought it downstairs,
it was wrapped in newspaper.

24:16.882 --> 24:19.953
Dated from the 1950s.. It was 1952.

24:19.954 --> 24:22.654
What's in here?

24:24.964 --> 24:29.284
And I take out a little wedding dress.

24:29.498 --> 24:32.684
It was for someone quite short.

24:32.685 --> 24:35.685
And very, very thin.

24:40.409 --> 24:42.267
Isn't it beautiful?

24:42.268 --> 24:46.288
The waist was really, really small.

24:48.244 --> 24:50.418
Why would someone take a wedding dress,

24:50.419 --> 24:54.022
roll it up in newspaper, and
stick it behind a wall?

24:54.023 --> 24:57.623
So to me, that seemed like..

24:57.761 --> 25:01.289
A negative. That seemed not a good thing.

25:01.290 --> 25:03.153
Where did you get this?

25:03.154 --> 25:05.434
The attic.

25:05.534 --> 25:10.754
I want you to leave the
stuff in the attic alone.

25:18.409 --> 25:20.299
She just wanted nothing to do with it.

25:20.300 --> 25:23.960
She wanted to get rid of it.

25:24.050 --> 25:26.930
She threw it away.

25:31.359 --> 25:36.596
About a year after I was divorced, I
met a very nice man named Matthew.

25:36.597 --> 25:41.069
We were dating a very short time when
one night, Karen, Christine, and I..

25:41.070 --> 25:42.841
We were just enjoying an evening.

25:42.842 --> 25:45.842
And it just started.

25:52.592 --> 25:55.508
It's like the house just
started to shudder.

25:55.509 --> 25:57.782
Mom, what is that?

25:57.783 --> 25:58.616
Mommy?

25:58.617 --> 26:02.571
It's probably just something outside.

26:02.572 --> 26:06.052
- The noises came.
- Mommy?

26:07.443 --> 26:11.763
The feeling of being watched was there.

26:14.157 --> 26:17.217
Mom. Mom, it's back.

26:18.145 --> 26:20.425
The sense of dread, the sense that..

26:20.426 --> 26:24.986
That.. That something bad was gonna happen.

26:36.907 --> 26:39.229
Christine. Christine.

26:39.230 --> 26:41.302
Stay there.

26:41.303 --> 26:43.066
- Mom.
- Mom, don't go there.

26:43.067 --> 26:44.735
Mom, be careful.

26:44.736 --> 26:47.772
It's as if the house became more alive.

26:47.773 --> 26:49.314
Christine.

26:49.315 --> 26:52.495
Mommy, don't go there!

26:54.680 --> 26:57.403
And I'm like, oh, God, okay.

26:57.404 --> 26:59.208
I'm gonna call Matthew.

26:59.209 --> 27:02.238
Could you.. Would you mind coming over?

27:02.239 --> 27:04.034
Okay. Thanks.

27:04.035 --> 27:06.669
She talked about her and girls were
there by themselves, and she was..

27:06.670 --> 27:09.927
Yeah, I was very concerned,
so I rushed on over.

27:09.928 --> 27:12.572
- Hi. Thanks so much for coming.
- Sure, sure. What's going on?

27:12.573 --> 27:14.986
I'm sorry, I didn't want
to call you so late.

27:14.987 --> 27:18.091
Then that's when they told me..

27:18.092 --> 27:20.012
Really why they called me.

27:20.013 --> 27:23.083
She was a little apprehensive
in telling me the truth.

27:23.084 --> 27:24.861
This is gonna sound really weird.

27:24.862 --> 27:26.425
- Okay.
- Um..

27:26.426 --> 27:28.172
I don't want you to think I'm crazy, but..

27:28.173 --> 27:31.158
And I just blurted everything
out about the house.

27:31.159 --> 27:34.058
And I said, really?

27:34.059 --> 27:36.831
- I said, are you kidding me?
- I thought he was gonna get up and walk.

27:36.832 --> 27:38.154
Are you serious?

27:38.155 --> 27:39.667
- Yes.
- Whoa.

27:39.668 --> 27:43.268
But he.. He didn't do that.

27:44.541 --> 27:46.607
- I'm gonna head up now.
- Okay.

27:46.608 --> 27:49.668
- Okay.
- Good night.

27:49.837 --> 27:54.749
As I started to watch TV,
I started to doze off.

27:54.750 --> 27:58.311
I went into this very vivid dream.

27:58.312 --> 28:01.598
I'm trying to open the door..

28:01.599 --> 28:05.019
Of the room that I'm in.

28:05.829 --> 28:09.053
And I was having trouble opening the door.

28:09.054 --> 28:12.474
It was very hard to move.

28:13.439 --> 28:17.367
It's like I was in this
half-sleep, half-awake state.

28:17.368 --> 28:22.328
And I was trying to turn, and I realized I
felt there was, like, this weight on me.

28:22.329 --> 28:24.528
It was kind of like a
simultaneous thing that was

28:24.529 --> 28:27.877
happening between the dream
and me physically moving.

28:27.878 --> 28:32.918
And as I'm able to..
I finally open the door..

28:37.688 --> 28:39.681
It was kind of a..

28:39.682 --> 28:42.802
A flash of a picture.

28:44.367 --> 28:47.764
And I saw a skeletal man.

28:47.765 --> 28:50.945
Lying on a dirt floor.

28:53.997 --> 28:55.670
I'll never forget the weight.

28:55.671 --> 28:59.599
I'll never forget how I
felt that I couldn't move.

28:59.600 --> 29:01.003
It was quite shocking.

29:01.004 --> 29:05.348
I wasn't happy that he had some
sort of suffocating dream.

29:05.349 --> 29:10.209
But again, it was another
piece of validation.

29:17.439 --> 29:22.119
I was in my bedroom when I heard something.

29:23.739 --> 29:27.289
I came around the corner of
the bend of the staircase.

29:27.290 --> 29:30.350
And I saw my Mother.

29:30.375 --> 29:31.555
Mom?

29:31.556 --> 29:34.049
I called out to her.
I wanted her to turn around.

29:34.050 --> 29:37.264
I didn't understand why she
was sitting on the stairs.

29:37.265 --> 29:40.085
Mom, is that you?

29:41.282 --> 29:43.142
Mom?

29:43.156 --> 29:45.786
I started to realize it was not my Mother.

29:45.787 --> 29:47.040
Mom?

29:47.041 --> 29:50.641
I was frozen. I was shocked.

29:52.060 --> 29:54.027
Mom! Mom!

29:54.028 --> 29:56.538
I realized what I had just
seen was not a person.

29:56.539 --> 29:57.434
It was not my Mother.

29:57.435 --> 30:00.485
She was like, I can't believe I saw that.
I cannot believe I saw that.

30:00.486 --> 30:02.441
I saw it. I saw it. I saw it.

30:02.442 --> 30:03.871
It's okay, Sweetie. It's okay.

30:03.872 --> 30:08.547
I got very frightened that
she'd actually seen something.

30:08.548 --> 30:10.744
It did make me wonder at
that point, you know,

30:10.745 --> 30:14.765
is something gonna get really ugly?

30:16.522 --> 30:17.631
Ewe.

30:17.632 --> 30:21.292
Okay, put that on top of it.

30:21.740 --> 30:24.132
Halloween and Christmas in my house..

30:24.133 --> 30:26.344
Was and still is huge.

30:26.345 --> 30:29.435
- Yeah, that's my favorite.
- Halloween punch?

30:29.436 --> 30:32.484
- All of it mixed all together, right?
- Hey! Here we go!

30:32.485 --> 30:33.651
Anything in the kitchen.

30:33.652 --> 30:35.510
Uh, yeah. Down the stairs.

30:35.511 --> 30:37.183
Went into the punch, yeah.

30:37.184 --> 30:39.295
The house was soon full of people.

30:39.296 --> 30:42.226
And a friend of mine from work came in.

30:42.227 --> 30:44.328
- Hi, Lisa!
- How are you?

30:44.329 --> 30:46.064
Come on in. Would you like a drink?

30:46.065 --> 30:49.000
- And I offered her a drink.
- Cheers. Have fun.

30:49.001 --> 30:50.957
You know, I said, okay,
have a really good time.

30:50.958 --> 30:56.858
And I went over talking to some people,
and I saw her talking to some people.

31:00.036 --> 31:04.109
And then I noticed first that
she went across the room.

31:04.110 --> 31:07.845
And then she looked toward the stairs,
and I just noticed her looking..

31:07.846 --> 31:12.286
I.. I interpreted it as her looking ill.

31:16.417 --> 31:20.664
And then suddenly, I see her
just standing there staring..

31:20.665 --> 31:22.600
Underneath the stairs.

31:22.601 --> 31:24.473
So I went over to her, and
I said, what's wrong?

31:24.474 --> 31:27.177
Are you.. Is something wrong? Are you sick?

31:27.178 --> 31:29.373
Are you okay, Lisa?

31:29.374 --> 31:32.635
And she said, your house is haunted.

31:32.636 --> 31:33.960
What do you mean?

31:33.961 --> 31:36.243
- That little lady, didn't you see her?
- No.

31:36.244 --> 31:38.483
I said, what little lady?
What are talking about?

31:38.484 --> 31:41.467
And all I could think about was the
little dress. The little dress.

31:41.468 --> 31:45.950
The little dress.
She said, she's very short, really thin.

31:45.951 --> 31:47.525
Elaine, you need to do
something about this.

31:47.526 --> 31:51.176
She said, you know, you really
should get your house cleaned.

31:51.177 --> 31:52.620
So I said, what do you mean, cleaned?

31:52.621 --> 31:54.854
And she said, get someone
in here and get 'em out.

31:54.855 --> 31:59.835
She said..
You can, you know, you can do that.

32:09.281 --> 32:12.458
After the party had died down
and everyone had gone home,

32:12.459 --> 32:18.359
Karen and I decided that we were going
to sleep in the same bed together.

32:50.553 --> 32:53.376
I just remember waking.

32:53.377 --> 32:59.077
And looking over at my sister,
who was right next to me.

33:00.864 --> 33:03.444
And I saw a..

33:03.656 --> 33:06.716
Shadowy, long figure..

33:07.292 --> 33:10.079
Kind of hovering over her.

33:10.080 --> 33:13.681
It looked like a cloud, a dark cloud.

33:13.682 --> 33:15.656
The middle of it was kind
of thick and opaque,

33:15.657 --> 33:17.752
and I couldn't see through that portion.

33:17.753 --> 33:21.066
It ran the length of her body.
It felt like..

33:21.067 --> 33:23.740
It felt like a fig.. A figure.

33:23.741 --> 33:28.612
I rolled over and tried to ignore
that that was there. I.. I..

33:28.613 --> 33:33.233
Forced myself to kind of go back to sleep.

33:42.510 --> 33:44.638
There was something wrong.

33:44.639 --> 33:49.139
I felt there was a presence in the room.

34:08.782 --> 34:14.681
I could feel my head push down, my
shoulders pushed down a little harder.

34:16.487 --> 34:19.368
It got so intense.

34:20.101 --> 34:23.297
I felt it was, for the first time..

34:23.297 --> 34:26.434
The gender, and it was a female presence.

34:26.435 --> 34:29.658
It was a female energy..

34:29.659 --> 34:33.884
Pushing down on me and
pushing down on me heavier,

34:33.885 --> 34:38.436
than any of the energies
that I felt at any time.

34:38.437 --> 34:42.059
This felt, angry, big and angry.
It just freaked me out.

34:42.060 --> 34:44.922
There was, like, this angry woman.

34:44.922 --> 34:48.103
Just pushing in on me.

34:52.601 --> 34:57.461
It.. It..
It just scared the hell out of me.

34:59.987 --> 35:05.567
I roamed around the house
looking for a place to sleep.

35:06.817 --> 35:10.627
And I was just crying and holding my
pillow and saying, this is ridiculous.

35:10.628 --> 35:14.169
This is.. I'm living a ridiculous life.
This is not normal.

35:14.170 --> 35:18.430
And I.. I.. Just had no where to go.

35:22.729 --> 35:28.094
I'm holding my pillow, and I
said, I can't sleep upstairs.

35:28.095 --> 35:32.175
I can't sleep in the back bedroom.

35:33.351 --> 35:36.951
I can't sleep on the couch.

35:39.163 --> 35:42.223
I'm out of my mind.

35:47.115 --> 35:48.782
There was a point, my sister called me up.

35:48.783 --> 35:50.284
Hi, it's me.

35:50.285 --> 35:54.088
And she said, look, I've
got to do something.

35:54.089 --> 35:56.656
This is getting to be too much.

35:56.657 --> 35:59.257
And that she was honestly
thinking of selling the house.

35:59.258 --> 36:03.278
She said, I can't live like this.

36:05.350 --> 36:10.087
I was throwing out the trash, and
I saw my next-door neighbor.

36:10.088 --> 36:11.833
I'm good, thank you. Yourself?

36:11.834 --> 36:14.075
And I said, you know..

36:14.076 --> 36:16.472
Could I talk to you for a moment?
And he said, sure, you know, what's up?

36:16.473 --> 36:19.374
And I said, have you ever had any..

36:19.375 --> 36:22.010
Hear anything strange ever
happening in this house?

36:22.011 --> 36:23.984
Why? Have you had some stuff happening?

36:23.985 --> 36:26.036
Well, actually, we have.

36:26.037 --> 36:28.261
Well, I'll tell you..

36:28.262 --> 36:31.428
Well, my neighbor said that he
used to babysit the children

36:31.429 --> 36:33.864
of the couple from whom
I'd purchased the house.

36:33.865 --> 36:35.711
Heard some pretty strange stuff.

36:35.712 --> 36:39.945
He said he remembered that
the old man had a son.

36:39.946 --> 36:41.872
And that the son married.

36:41.873 --> 36:46.977
You know, they were very young, so
they moved in upstairs into the attic.

36:46.978 --> 36:50.413
You.. You know she died up there?

36:50.414 --> 36:53.083
- She died in the house?
- Yes.

36:53.084 --> 36:54.521
- No, I didn't know that.
- Right up there.

36:54.522 --> 37:00.422
And he pointed up at the room in
the attic where Karen was living.

37:04.560 --> 37:08.165
Well the house was so large
that they would try to

37:08.166 --> 37:12.576
communicate to each other
by banging on the heaters.

37:12.577 --> 37:14.925
And that would be like a
signal that someone should

37:14.926 --> 37:19.445
come upstairs, or that
they needed some help.

37:19.446 --> 37:23.261
And the guy was knocking on the
pipes trying to get attention.

37:23.262 --> 37:27.711
And apparently she slipped
and hit her head and uh..

37:27.712 --> 37:29.400
Died right there on the floor.

37:29.401 --> 37:32.504
My neighbor said that he
will never forget because

37:32.505 --> 37:34.991
when they got married,
she stood on the steps.

37:34.992 --> 37:37.702
And what he said after that..

37:37.703 --> 37:40.478
Really astounded me.

37:40.479 --> 37:43.327
And she was a tiny little thing.

37:43.328 --> 37:45.406
But beautiful.

37:45.407 --> 37:49.887
He said she was wearing a pretty
little white wedding press.

37:49.888 --> 37:53.803
And I'm like, oh, my God,
what a conflagration of..

37:53.804 --> 37:56.384
Of facts here.

38:03.669 --> 38:08.649
So I had the white dress
wrapped in newspaper..

38:10.686 --> 38:13.983
My colleague talking to
the little lady in white.

38:13.984 --> 38:17.916
And my neighbor now telling
me about an actual person..

38:17.917 --> 38:22.177
Who was little who was wearing white..

38:23.389 --> 38:25.992
And who passed away in the house.

38:25.993 --> 38:27.592
And that was just..

38:27.593 --> 38:33.053
Way too coincidental to brush
off in any, in any way.

38:33.165 --> 38:36.744
The story he told affected me greatly.

38:36.745 --> 38:39.632
I think his story was
absolutely the strongest

38:39.633 --> 38:43.422
validation of anything ever that I got.

38:43.423 --> 38:46.988
All these anomalous things that
were happening in the house

38:46.989 --> 38:50.889
suddenly started to come together.

38:51.105 --> 38:56.385
It changed the way I felt
about what was going on.

38:57.153 --> 38:59.762
You know, it's like having a
bad flu and you're finally..

38:59.763 --> 39:03.146
You know, you finally broke a sweat.

39:03.147 --> 39:06.338
The house has been sick, and now..

39:06.339 --> 39:08.775
You know the final symptom has occurred.

39:08.776 --> 39:14.676
We got some information.
And now something's actually gonna happen.

39:16.752 --> 39:21.192
I had absolutely no idea what to expect.

39:24.880 --> 39:30.780
As if something was guiding her,
she went directly down there.

39:31.266 --> 39:34.279
She was saying, this is the area.

39:34.280 --> 39:39.920
This is the location that a
lot of things are going on.

39:55.084 --> 39:57.608
You couldn't have paid me any
amount of money to hoist

39:57.609 --> 40:02.829
myself up and sit in that
dirt room, but she did.

40:05.519 --> 40:07.726
She put her whole head in there,

40:07.727 --> 40:12.773
and she said, you have a
big problem in this room.

40:12.774 --> 40:17.051
The medium was continuously
saying, you are dead.

40:17.052 --> 40:20.223
You must go. You must go to the light.

40:20.224 --> 40:23.765
This is not your house.
You don't belong here any more.

40:23.766 --> 40:28.866
So that was repeated many,
many, many times over.

40:35.640 --> 40:38.168
Once the whole day was done.

40:38.169 --> 40:42.348
It's hard to describe the state we were in.
We were tired.

40:42.349 --> 40:47.749
Very drained from the whole day.
And we went to bed.

41:04.083 --> 41:06.343
It was when we got up in the morning..

41:06.344 --> 41:09.931
That, I mean, I just rolled
over on my bed and opened the..

41:09.932 --> 41:12.812
My eyes and said..

41:12.882 --> 41:15.682
"Something's different".

41:15.683 --> 41:19.103
The atmosphere was lighter.

41:20.318 --> 41:22.815
The air was not as thick.

41:22.816 --> 41:26.176
It was appreciably better.

41:26.882 --> 41:32.609
It's like when you open up a window and,
all of a sudden, sunshine comes in, and..

41:32.610 --> 41:37.109
And light comes in, and the air is fresher.

41:37.110 --> 41:39.995
Okay, girls! You ready to go?

41:39.996 --> 41:43.632
Hey, girls, come on! Beach time! Let's go!

41:43.633 --> 41:46.402
Looking back at what happened,

41:46.403 --> 41:50.543
I feel that we experienced a piece..

41:50.667 --> 41:51.880
Of the unknown.

41:51.881 --> 41:55.961
We shared our space with something..

41:56.544 --> 42:00.204
That is not yet known to us.

42:01.317 --> 42:04.346
There's so much in life
that we don't understand.

42:04.347 --> 42:07.923
But there may be something else.

42:07.924 --> 42:10.492
- Okay, guys, we're off.
- Perfect day.

42:10.493 --> 42:13.133
Perfect weather.
