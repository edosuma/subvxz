WEBVTT

00:10.523 --> 00:13.425
All right, everyone
settle. Notebooks out.

00:13.517 --> 00:15.698
We're going to start
with three sentences.

00:15.699 --> 00:18.409
At least one noun and
one verb in each one.

00:18.502 --> 00:20.485
In English.

00:20.486 --> 00:22.666
Uh, Martina, why don't you go first?

00:22.667 --> 00:25.167
Three things you saw on
your way to class today.

00:25.231 --> 00:27.551
Uh, I saw...

00:27.552 --> 00:29.062
a man...

00:29.063 --> 00:31.149
ped... pedalling his bicycle.

00:31.150 --> 00:32.469
Pedalling. Good. Good.

00:32.470 --> 00:35.377
And then I saw my friend Klaus

00:35.460 --> 00:36.932
kiss Katrina Wolf.

00:36.933 --> 00:41.404
And then I saw Katrina slap Klaus' face.

00:41.454 --> 00:44.689
It's true. Katrina hates Klaus.

00:52.397 --> 00:54.897
Anna, please turn your phone off.

00:58.361 --> 01:00.861
Your phone... turn it off.

01:03.997 --> 01:06.497
It wasn't ringing.

01:14.642 --> 01:17.142
Martina, take over class.

01:19.000 --> 01:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:38.466 --> 01:40.966
Aah!

01:48.793 --> 01:51.293
Mrs. Kohl?

01:54.082 --> 01:56.582
Mrs. Kohl!

01:58.775 --> 02:02.540
Vertel hen het is grappig!

02:04.034 --> 02:06.534
Mrs. Kohl!

02:18.385 --> 02:20.952
Bobby Orr moves in for the shot...

02:24.502 --> 02:25.537
Don't laugh at me.

02:25.538 --> 02:28.038
I wouldn't dream of it.
Let me get your stick.

02:31.508 --> 02:34.008
All right, let 'er rip.

02:34.230 --> 02:36.361
Here. Move back here.

02:36.362 --> 02:37.540
Use a little more wrist.

02:37.541 --> 02:40.041
And just put a little
more snap in it, like this.

02:41.307 --> 02:42.820
- Lift it up.
- What position did you play?

02:42.821 --> 02:44.279
I was defense.

02:44.280 --> 02:46.780
High school coach moved me up to center.

02:47.435 --> 02:49.091
You were a chick magnet, right?

02:49.092 --> 02:52.041
Actually, my first face-off
I ever took as a center,

02:52.134 --> 02:53.457
I got knocked right on my ass.

02:53.458 --> 02:57.408
The other team's center was like
this 15ear-old, 6'2", bearded...

02:57.686 --> 03:00.186
actually, probably on steroids,
now that I think about it.

03:01.370 --> 03:03.870
So finally there was 12 seconds
left. We're down by a goal.

03:03.886 --> 03:06.929
I had my teeth kicked in so many times,
I said, "you know what? Screw it. "

03:07.022 --> 03:08.773
I just stopped caring. I won the draw.

03:08.774 --> 03:11.274
Skated around him,
moved in for the shot.

03:11.384 --> 03:13.464
You tied the game.

03:13.465 --> 03:15.676
Nah, I hit the post.

03:15.677 --> 03:18.177
But I did learn something about

03:18.427 --> 03:20.927
how we can let fear get in the way.

03:21.441 --> 03:23.941
Syd, I know you want
to take things slow, but

03:24.277 --> 03:26.777
what are you afraid of?

03:34.103 --> 03:36.603
Yeah?

03:58.633 --> 04:00.050
Her name is Nancy Cahill,

04:00.051 --> 04:02.551
an operative in Langley's
narcotics task force

04:02.564 --> 04:04.981
specializing in the
development of new synthetics.

04:04.982 --> 04:07.835
She's been stationed in Europe
for the past three years.

04:07.975 --> 04:11.829
Her cover... associate professor
at Amsterdam University.

04:11.921 --> 04:13.913
She shot herself 36 hours ago.

04:13.914 --> 04:16.527
Eyewitness report... a
student from Cahill's class.

04:16.620 --> 04:20.045
Her last words... "vertel
hen het is grappig. "

04:20.182 --> 04:21.459
Tell them it's funny.

04:21.459 --> 04:23.878
Cahill's most recent psych
eval reported nothing of note.

04:23.879 --> 04:26.347
Her mental status reviews
have been exemplary.

04:26.348 --> 04:27.573
What's our assignment?

04:27.574 --> 04:32.097
Cahill's husband... Jason, also
an agent... has gone off the grid.

04:32.283 --> 04:34.945
Hasn't been in touch with
his handler in three weeks.

04:35.037 --> 04:38.558
All attempts to contact him after his
wife's death have been unsuccessful.

04:38.698 --> 04:42.075
Objective is quite simple.
Locate Jason Cahill.

04:42.168 --> 04:43.965
So, Dixon, you take Weiss.

04:43.966 --> 04:45.957
Retrace Nancy Cahill's final days.

04:45.958 --> 04:48.458
Vaughn, you and Nadia do
the same for Jason Cahill.

04:48.708 --> 04:51.941
Sydney, Jack, Cahill's Amsterdam
apartment. Standard protocol.

04:52.128 --> 04:56.603
Recover all files, classified computers,
any evidence of CIA affiliation.

04:56.787 --> 04:59.287
Any questions?

05:29.095 --> 05:31.595
No bulbs.

08:58.749 --> 09:00.215
Good news, agent Bristow.

09:00.216 --> 09:02.716
Your blood work's negative,
and your scans are clean.

09:02.727 --> 09:04.045
May I?

09:04.046 --> 09:06.546
Yeah.

09:10.181 --> 09:12.386
Looks fine.

09:12.387 --> 09:14.521
My little brother did
the same thing to me once.

09:14.522 --> 09:15.365
Bit me like this.

09:15.366 --> 09:17.981
Perhaps you can tell us now what
you were looking for in the cat scan.

09:18.072 --> 09:21.402
The Cahills came in contact with a
drug that affected the nervous system.

09:21.635 --> 09:24.726
Pineal gland was about
twice the normal size.

09:24.866 --> 09:27.189
Nancy Cahill's autopsy
revealed the same condition.

09:27.190 --> 09:28.512
Which indicates what?

09:28.513 --> 09:29.739
By itself, nothing.

09:29.740 --> 09:31.111
The pineal converts melatonin,

09:31.112 --> 09:33.612
which regulates sleep
cycles and body temperature.

09:33.626 --> 09:35.474
However, acute melatonin imbalance

09:35.475 --> 09:37.896
has been known to induce
uncharacteristic behavior,

09:37.897 --> 09:39.973
even acts of extreme violence.

09:39.974 --> 09:41.297
The writing in Cahill's closet...

09:41.298 --> 09:44.914
it seemed like he was suffering
from severe paranoia. Seeing demons.

09:45.006 --> 09:45.897
I know.

09:45.898 --> 09:48.221
I initially assumed we were
dealing with a psychotropic,

09:48.222 --> 09:50.979
but hallucinogens have
particular biochemical markers,

09:51.072 --> 09:52.536
none of which were present here.

09:52.537 --> 09:55.197
No matter what drug Jason
Cahill may have been exposed to,

09:55.292 --> 09:58.142
he couldn't have transmitted
it to Sydney by biting her.

09:58.327 --> 09:59.791
So why the cat scan?

09:59.792 --> 10:02.292
The Cahills dealt with emerging drugs.

10:02.402 --> 10:04.392
I wanted to take every precaution.

10:04.393 --> 10:07.531
But all of our diagnostics
indicate that you're fine.

10:07.763 --> 10:09.176
Do you feel okay?

10:09.177 --> 10:11.433
Fine.

10:11.434 --> 10:14.812
Langley wants to know what substance
the Cahills came in contact with.

10:14.904 --> 10:16.129
Who's manufacturing it?

10:16.130 --> 10:18.151
What is it being used for?

10:18.152 --> 10:19.837
So, what do we know?

10:19.838 --> 10:22.736
Neither Cahill traveled outside
Amsterdam in the past month.

10:22.877 --> 10:25.777
In her last days, Nancy placed twice
her usual amount of phone calls.

10:25.869 --> 10:27.382
They were routed
through anonymous relays.

10:27.383 --> 10:29.278
Standard deep-cover protocol.

10:29.279 --> 10:30.886
Well, if you give me
the routing numbers,

10:30.887 --> 10:33.066
I'll see if I can hack a back-trace.

10:33.067 --> 10:34.768
As far as Cahill's laptop,

10:34.769 --> 10:36.090
the hard drive was erased,

10:36.091 --> 10:38.591
but it's possible the files
weren't completely rewritten.

10:38.791 --> 10:41.017
I'll see if I can reconstruct them.

10:41.018 --> 10:43.181
Okay, what do we know about these?

10:43.182 --> 10:44.600
Jason Cahill was analyzing data...

10:44.601 --> 10:47.101
names, dates, links between sources.

10:47.117 --> 10:48.965
He was looking for something
I don't know, maybe his mind.

10:48.966 --> 10:50.126
This guy was a little crazy.

10:50.127 --> 10:52.627
His wife actually
locked him in his closet.

10:53.825 --> 10:55.099
Sydney's fine.

10:55.100 --> 10:56.376
Just exhausted.

10:56.377 --> 10:59.087
She hasn't slept in 36 hours,
so I'm sending her home.

10:59.226 --> 11:00.778
Yes, of course.

11:00.779 --> 11:03.279
Excuse me.

11:03.874 --> 11:05.609
Hey.

11:05.610 --> 11:08.110
Hey.

11:08.840 --> 11:11.020
Oh, you think it's sexy, don't you?

11:11.021 --> 11:12.293
Ha ha. Only if I had done it.

11:12.294 --> 11:14.754
You need a ride home?

11:14.755 --> 11:16.698
No, thanks.

11:16.699 --> 11:19.199
I was freaked out,
but now I'm just tired.

11:21.036 --> 11:23.536
- Good night.
- Good night.

13:10.289 --> 13:12.789
It's not that big of a deal.

13:13.956 --> 13:16.207
You still think that's funny.

13:16.208 --> 13:17.930
Great.

13:17.931 --> 13:19.920
Oh, god, I hope we didn't wake you up.

13:19.921 --> 13:21.005
How are you doing?

13:21.006 --> 13:22.039
I'm fine.

13:22.040 --> 13:24.847
I had a headache. I
couldn't sleep, but I'm fine.

13:26.380 --> 13:29.149
Have you learned anything new?

13:29.563 --> 13:31.887
Uh, well, let me just
say Cahill's papers...

13:31.888 --> 13:34.388
just thinking about
them makes my head hurt.

13:34.403 --> 13:37.113
Marshall says he's making some
progress with Cahill's hard disk.

13:37.205 --> 13:39.480
He thinks he may be able
to retrieve the data.

13:39.481 --> 13:40.838
Yeah.

13:40.839 --> 13:42.715
Oh.

13:42.716 --> 13:44.038
What?

13:44.039 --> 13:46.700
- Are you st...
- What, staying over?

13:46.979 --> 13:48.229
No.

13:48.230 --> 13:51.607
No. Unless I am. Am I?

13:51.653 --> 13:53.023
- You're not.
- I'm not.

13:53.024 --> 13:53.726
I'll walk you out.

13:53.727 --> 13:55.336
She's gonna walk me out. She almost
said yes. You saw that, right?

13:55.337 --> 13:56.366
Right now.

13:56.367 --> 13:57.448
This close. I was...

13:57.449 --> 13:58.247
Good night.

13:58.248 --> 14:00.748
Good night.

14:44.151 --> 14:45.880
Hey.

14:45.881 --> 14:46.801
Sorry.

14:46.802 --> 14:48.070
You're here early.

14:48.071 --> 14:50.571
I couldn't sleep.

14:50.652 --> 14:52.872
What do you think about this?

14:52.873 --> 14:55.373
Was Jason Cahill just delusional?

14:55.948 --> 14:58.225
We're assuming the Cahills
realized they were affected...

14:58.226 --> 15:00.591
something they came in contact with.

15:00.592 --> 15:02.343
Probably a drug from
one of their sources.

15:02.344 --> 15:04.844
But which source, which
drug, they didn't know.

15:05.094 --> 15:07.803
Looks like they were retracing
their steps trying to figure it out.

15:09.186 --> 15:11.686
Maybe looking for an antidote.

15:13.448 --> 15:15.991
I thought I was losing my mind.

15:16.084 --> 15:18.360
The hard disk was wiped clean, remember?

15:18.361 --> 15:20.160
But the data recovery
wasn't the problem.

15:20.161 --> 15:21.178
The files were fragmented.

15:21.179 --> 15:23.106
What's on the disk?

15:23.107 --> 15:24.503
The mother lode.

15:24.504 --> 15:25.969
Cahill's travel itineraries,

15:25.970 --> 15:28.438
dead-drop protocols, routing
numbers for discretionary funds.

15:28.439 --> 15:30.143
What's pressing for now...

15:30.144 --> 15:33.378
according to their records, Jason Cahill
has a meeting scheduled for Bucharest.

15:33.470 --> 15:35.937
His contact is known
to him as the Count.

15:35.938 --> 15:37.879
The Count? You got to be kidding me.

15:37.880 --> 15:40.493
The Count is mentioned several
times in Cahill's papers.

15:40.588 --> 15:42.003
He seems to be one of their sources.

15:42.004 --> 15:44.504
He supplies them with
samples of new drugs.

15:44.520 --> 15:47.134
Now here is a photo.

15:47.227 --> 15:49.727
I retrieved it from
one of Cahill's disks.

15:49.918 --> 15:53.532
Ladies and gentlemen,
introducing the Count.

15:53.720 --> 15:54.755
The meeting is tomorrow night.

15:54.756 --> 15:57.175
Obviously Cahill won't
attend, but we will.

15:57.176 --> 15:59.837
Sydney, you will identify
yourself as an associate of Jason.

15:59.977 --> 16:01.583
You will lead him into a conversation

16:01.584 --> 16:04.005
and find out what drugs
he'd acquired for them.

16:04.006 --> 16:06.506
It's a mistake.

16:06.869 --> 16:07.951
I beg your pardon?

16:07.952 --> 16:11.234
Sending Sydney back into the field
so quickly. It's a tactical error.

16:11.327 --> 16:12.124
No, it's...

16:12.125 --> 16:13.783
Sydney, someone else can do this.

16:13.784 --> 16:15.601
I'm fine.

16:15.602 --> 16:18.102
That's it.

16:21.585 --> 16:25.634
Well, based on my limited
experience with mind-altering drugs,

16:25.726 --> 16:27.049
this one must have been a doozy.

16:27.050 --> 16:29.616
Theoretically, could the drug's
effects have a delayed reaction?

16:29.710 --> 16:31.843
Well, there is that half-hour
or so for it to kick in.

16:31.844 --> 16:33.405
That's not what I mean.
I mean like a while,

16:33.406 --> 16:34.585
like a day or two.

16:34.586 --> 16:36.624
Uh, I'm not sure. Hold
on a second. It's my wife.

16:36.625 --> 16:37.469
Hey, honey.

16:37.470 --> 16:38.840
I'll look into it, okay?

16:38.841 --> 16:39.973
Yeah, sure, put him on.

16:39.974 --> 16:43.638
Hey, boo-boo! Daddy
loves you. Yes, he does.

16:44.430 --> 16:45.989
Scans of Cahill's papers.

16:45.990 --> 16:47.551
His references to the Count.

16:47.552 --> 16:49.716
Thank you. Ahh.

16:49.717 --> 16:51.130
Another headache?

16:51.131 --> 16:53.568
Yeah.

16:53.569 --> 16:55.253
I've got some aspirin. You want it?

16:55.254 --> 16:56.995
No, thanks.

16:56.996 --> 16:58.865
This is gonna sound crazy.

16:58.866 --> 17:01.190
After you got home last
night, I took my temperature.

17:01.191 --> 17:02.126
Mm-hmm?

17:02.127 --> 17:04.208
It was 111.

17:04.209 --> 17:05.863
Syd, that's not possible.

17:05.864 --> 17:08.717
I know. I must have
been dreaming, right?

17:09.415 --> 17:10.690
You told Dr. Jain?

17:10.691 --> 17:12.299
Everything was back
to normal this morning.

17:12.300 --> 17:13.719
All my tests came back negative.

17:13.720 --> 17:15.279
You have to let them know.

17:15.280 --> 17:17.174
You just said it yourself
it's not possible.

17:17.175 --> 17:19.214
It's not, but still, you have to.

17:19.214 --> 17:21.491
If I tell them, they'll sideline
me for who knows how long.

17:21.492 --> 17:22.815
If you don't tell them, I will.

17:22.816 --> 17:24.329
Nadia, I'm fine.

17:24.329 --> 17:25.364
I shouldn't have said anything.

17:25.365 --> 17:27.008
Hey.

17:27.009 --> 17:29.509
- Plane's waiting.
- Okay.

17:33.158 --> 17:35.773
Uh, what's going on here, girl stuff?

17:38.511 --> 17:41.011
People stuff.

17:42.307 --> 17:44.807
Be safe.

17:50.536 --> 17:52.190
You wanted to see me?

17:52.191 --> 17:54.691
Yes. Please.

17:57.728 --> 18:00.723
You know, Marcus, I appreciate
your friendship with Sydney.

18:02.590 --> 18:05.090
Having said that,

18:05.226 --> 18:07.888
whether or not an agent is
fit for duty is my decision.

18:07.980 --> 18:11.595
We both know Sydney has a
history of putting her work

18:11.689 --> 18:13.579
ahead of her own well-being.

18:13.580 --> 18:15.358
I was just suggesting that someone...

18:15.359 --> 18:17.140
Dixon,

18:17.141 --> 18:20.089
in the 11 years that you
worked for me at SD-6,

18:21.955 --> 18:24.952
I came to recognize your
brilliance as a field agent.

18:25.885 --> 18:27.971
But during those 11 years,

18:27.972 --> 18:32.303
not once did you suspect that you were
working for a renegade organization.

18:34.310 --> 18:36.810
What are you suggesting?

18:36.820 --> 18:40.627
That somehow my loyalty is a liability?

18:41.186 --> 18:44.086
I'm suggesting that you do your job,

18:44.785 --> 18:47.285
and that I do mine.

19:12.875 --> 19:14.149
11:30 we should move.

19:14.150 --> 19:14.852
Sydney,

19:14.853 --> 19:15.793
when we find the Count,

19:15.794 --> 19:17.260
you'll approach him
and see what he knows.

19:17.261 --> 19:20.494
If he gets suspicious, the
abort code is "takedown. "

19:20.635 --> 19:23.582
Once we're inside the club, you'll
take point. I'll cover the back.

19:35.633 --> 19:38.133
Sydney!

19:43.208 --> 19:45.708
Tea was hotter than I expected.

19:49.584 --> 19:52.084
Give me a minute to change.

19:56.936 --> 19:59.884
I want one of us to have line
of sight on her at all times.

20:05.864 --> 20:07.134
You see him?

20:07.135 --> 20:09.635
Negative.

20:20.114 --> 20:22.614
Okay, he's at the front bar.

20:22.832 --> 20:25.332
I'm on my way.

20:37.416 --> 20:39.916
Jason Cahill.

20:44.732 --> 20:46.151
Is good.

20:46.152 --> 20:48.767
Is good you come, but, uh,

20:48.858 --> 20:51.358
not safe to talk in the open.

20:52.532 --> 20:55.096
At end of hall is balcony.

20:55.189 --> 20:57.689
Count to 10, meet me there.

20:59.427 --> 21:01.368
He could run. I'm not gonna wait.

21:01.369 --> 21:03.869
I agree. Go.

21:46.885 --> 21:49.385
Come.

21:52.167 --> 21:53.154
Who are you?

21:53.155 --> 21:54.621
Why did Jason not come?

21:54.622 --> 21:57.044
He's sick. He sent me
to talk to you for him.

21:57.045 --> 21:59.180
He's sick? He's sick how?

21:59.181 --> 22:01.170
Listen, he wanted me to tell you...

22:01.171 --> 22:02.719
You're lying.

22:02.720 --> 22:03.471
Who are you?

22:03.472 --> 22:05.318
- I'm not lying.
- Turn around.

22:05.319 --> 22:05.834
I just wanted...

22:05.835 --> 22:08.335
I said turn around! Turn around!

22:09.038 --> 22:11.538
Cahill is dead. His wife is, too.

22:14.288 --> 22:15.798
Who are you?!

22:15.799 --> 22:17.116
You're police?!

22:17.117 --> 22:18.151
I don't know what they told you,

22:18.152 --> 22:19.141
but they're dead because...

22:19.142 --> 22:20.607
Oh, no, you lie again!

22:20.608 --> 22:21.929
They were affected by a drug.

22:21.930 --> 22:23.253
I'm trying to find out what that is.

22:23.254 --> 22:24.801
Oh, my god.

22:24.802 --> 22:26.076
You know what that drug is.

22:26.077 --> 22:28.577
Tell me what it is.

22:31.628 --> 22:33.762
We're under fire!

22:33.763 --> 22:36.263
Takedown! Takedown!

22:48.691 --> 22:50.147
You all right?

22:50.148 --> 22:51.231
Your arm.

22:51.232 --> 22:52.454
I'm okay.

22:52.455 --> 22:54.955
Let's get him out of here.

23:07.926 --> 23:10.638
We know who you are. Andre Sterescu.

23:10.822 --> 23:12.888
Yes. It's a good pronunciation.

23:12.889 --> 23:15.117
We know you're a romanian
national, 32 years old,

23:15.118 --> 23:18.066
charged twice with possession
of black market electronics.

23:18.205 --> 23:19.669
We know you were
convicted three years ago

23:19.670 --> 23:21.613
for fencing stolen pharmaceuticals.

23:21.614 --> 23:23.440
Yes, I wanted to appeal this one.

23:23.441 --> 23:25.941
Tell us what you know about this man.

23:34.034 --> 23:37.028
I will only say if you choose
not to cooperate with us,

23:37.215 --> 23:40.545
you'll regret that decision
for the rest of your life.

23:44.263 --> 23:45.919
Who are you guys, huh?

23:45.920 --> 23:48.420
Just answer the question.

23:51.405 --> 23:53.763
He told me he was chemist.

23:53.764 --> 23:55.942
Worked for pharmaceutical company.

23:55.943 --> 23:59.129
He hired me to be his, uh, spy.

23:59.222 --> 24:00.856
Keep eye on competition.

24:00.857 --> 24:02.608
Well, in a sense that's
true, but in fact,

24:02.609 --> 24:05.109
you were spying on behalf
of the U.S. Government.

24:05.824 --> 24:07.815
Oh.

24:07.816 --> 24:09.644
Who called the meet, you or Cahill?

24:09.645 --> 24:11.108
- He did.
- Why?

24:11.109 --> 24:12.618
I don't know.

24:12.619 --> 24:14.275
You performed other jobs for him.

24:14.276 --> 24:15.025
Yeah.

24:15.026 --> 24:16.442
Start with the most recent.

24:16.443 --> 24:18.813
Uh, I made this... how do you say?

24:18.814 --> 24:21.314
This, uh... pen.

24:21.486 --> 24:23.986
Marshall.

24:27.873 --> 24:29.721
Hey, Syd, guess what? Your idea?

24:29.722 --> 24:30.662
Well, you were right.

24:30.663 --> 24:31.411
What idea?

24:31.412 --> 24:33.689
The incubation period. Turns
out I did some research.

24:33.690 --> 24:36.494
The germans and the czechs...
well, not all of the germans...

24:36.569 --> 24:37.979
just the chemists.

24:37.980 --> 24:40.113
Anyway, they've been toying
around with some designer analogs

24:40.114 --> 24:42.343
that cross the blood/brain
barrier via a pathogen.

24:42.344 --> 24:44.667
So in other words, this
drug works like a virus.

24:44.668 --> 24:46.704
It gets in your blood it
incubates for a few days,

24:46.705 --> 24:49.029
it infects you, and then
permanently alters your brain.

24:49.030 --> 24:50.066
Weird, huh?

24:50.067 --> 24:51.485
Anyway, I called Dr. Jain.

24:51.486 --> 24:53.028
He's gonna culture Cahill's blood

24:53.029 --> 24:55.305
and make sure that's not
what we're dealing with, okay?

24:55.306 --> 24:57.825
Syd, this isn't about you?

24:57.917 --> 24:59.288
You're feeling okay, right?

24:59.289 --> 25:01.789
Yeah.

25:02.513 --> 25:03.996
Thank you, Marshall.

25:03.997 --> 25:06.497
No problem. That's what I'm here for.

25:17.199 --> 25:18.853
Nocturne.

25:18.854 --> 25:20.843
Two weeks ago, you
deliver a sample to Cahill.

25:20.844 --> 25:21.831
Tell me about it.

25:21.832 --> 25:23.584
Comes in vial like this.

25:23.585 --> 25:26.913
Cahill says is like speed, only better.

25:27.006 --> 25:29.135
What do you mean, like speed?

25:29.136 --> 25:31.507
You take, you don't sleep.

25:31.508 --> 25:34.932
Except not just energy.

25:35.007 --> 25:37.036
But no need to rest.

25:37.037 --> 25:38.788
You failed to include
where it came from.

25:38.789 --> 25:40.586
Yes, because I don't know.

25:40.587 --> 25:45.728
Cahill says Nocturne
developed in eastern bloc.

25:47.549 --> 25:49.777
But I find no evidence of this,

25:49.778 --> 25:52.199
so I ask an associate.

25:52.200 --> 25:55.194
One week later, he bring
me sample of Nocturne.

25:55.287 --> 25:56.657
He didn't tell you where
he got the nocturne?

25:56.658 --> 26:00.606
No. Is too bad for you.

26:02.147 --> 26:04.647
Because you're dying, too.

26:10.078 --> 26:12.578
You all right?

26:12.877 --> 26:15.377
Yeah.

26:15.494 --> 26:17.723
It seems that Nocturne
incorporates a stimulant

26:17.724 --> 26:19.236
which overrides the pineal gland.

26:19.237 --> 26:21.562
There was intel a few years
ago that the north koreans

26:21.563 --> 26:23.771
were working on an experimental
project just like this one

26:23.772 --> 26:25.208
trying to create 24-hour soldiers.

26:25.209 --> 26:26.340
And there have been others.

26:26.341 --> 26:27.090
All failures,

26:27.091 --> 26:30.134
because no one fully understood the
true biochemical nature of dreaming.

26:30.274 --> 26:33.078
So the Cahills' delusions
were forms of dreams?

26:33.171 --> 26:35.397
Nightmares, yes. In
a matter of speaking.

26:35.398 --> 26:37.197
Problem being with these dreams,

26:37.198 --> 26:40.146
once triggered, there's no waking up.

26:40.518 --> 26:43.275
Sydney, are you listening?

26:43.695 --> 26:46.009
It's working, isn't it?

26:46.010 --> 26:48.088
Bit by bit.

26:48.089 --> 26:50.589
I'm wearing down your defenses.

26:50.679 --> 26:53.179
I'm gaining your trust.

26:53.937 --> 26:56.885
But we both know at some
point I'll betray you.

26:57.725 --> 27:00.483
And the people you care
most deeply about...

27:00.713 --> 27:03.213
they'll die.

27:06.809 --> 27:09.309
Syd, you okay?

27:16.601 --> 27:17.769
Ahh!

27:17.770 --> 27:20.652
You weren't surprised when I told
you Cahill had died from Nocturne.

27:20.745 --> 27:21.875
You weren't surprised.

27:21.876 --> 27:23.292
Why weren't you surprised?

27:23.293 --> 27:25.141
What aren't you telling me?!

27:25.142 --> 27:26.128
I'm telling you everything.

27:26.129 --> 27:28.629
Do not lie to me!

27:30.310 --> 27:31.870
I'm one of them.

27:31.871 --> 27:34.320
Do you hear me, you son of a bitch?

27:34.321 --> 27:36.821
Cahill bit me.

27:39.576 --> 27:41.790
Okay.

27:41.791 --> 27:44.291
I know is bad.

27:45.357 --> 27:47.857
It is why I was to meet Cahill.

27:48.013 --> 27:50.193
I contact him to tell him.

27:50.194 --> 27:52.274
I don't find Nocturne.

27:52.275 --> 27:53.837
At least not what they make today.

27:53.838 --> 27:55.159
So what did you give Cahill?

27:55.160 --> 27:56.335
Old sample.

27:56.336 --> 27:58.470
It was meant to be destroyed.

27:58.471 --> 28:00.971
This drug, it go right through skin.

28:01.127 --> 28:02.211
And he didn't know this?

28:02.212 --> 28:04.190
I need money.

28:04.191 --> 28:05.751
I lied to him.

28:05.752 --> 28:07.073
I'm sorry.

28:07.074 --> 28:09.158
From where? Where did it come from?

28:09.159 --> 28:12.011
I don't know. I don't
know somewhere in Prague.

28:12.478 --> 28:14.978
I don't know.

28:15.159 --> 28:17.361
I'm sorry.

28:17.362 --> 28:19.862
I'm very sorry.

28:27.102 --> 28:29.378
What's the last thing Nancy
Cahill said to that eyewitness?

28:29.379 --> 28:31.273
"Vertel hen het is grappig"?

28:31.274 --> 28:32.644
Tell them it's funny?

28:32.645 --> 28:35.145
That's gotta mean something else.

28:35.752 --> 28:36.835
The Grappig group.

28:36.836 --> 28:37.584
Prague.

28:37.585 --> 28:39.993
A loose affiliation of
biochemical engineers.

28:39.994 --> 28:43.228
Milan Latuza. Grappig senior chemist.

28:43.274 --> 28:47.224
Specializes in the synthesis and
isolation of novel therapeutics.

28:47.363 --> 28:49.841
Nancy Cahill had found
where nocturne originated,

28:49.842 --> 28:52.165
only she was too far gone
to do anything about it.

28:52.166 --> 28:53.679
Jack, I know this isn't
what you want to hear,

28:53.680 --> 28:55.763
but even if we could
recover a sample of the drug,

28:55.764 --> 28:57.800
we don't have enough time
to engineer an antidote.

28:57.801 --> 28:59.982
Sydney needs medical attention.

28:59.983 --> 29:02.259
Unless Latuza's already
taken that step for us.

29:02.260 --> 29:04.298
If they realize they made
a bad batch of Nocturne,

29:04.299 --> 29:06.240
it's possible they
manufactured a remedy.

29:06.241 --> 29:07.180
Contact the jet.

29:07.181 --> 29:09.681
We're going to Prague.

29:21.778 --> 29:23.340
Once you've accessed Latuza's database,

29:23.341 --> 29:25.955
any files that may be even
remotely related to Nocturne...

29:26.048 --> 29:28.450
research, test results, formulas...

29:28.451 --> 29:30.392
I'll grab what I can.

29:30.393 --> 29:32.333
What if I don't find anything?

29:32.334 --> 29:34.834
Let's not discuss that here.

29:36.138 --> 29:38.584
Sydney's not as
trustworthy as her mother.

29:38.585 --> 29:40.613
I know.

29:40.614 --> 29:43.114
I'm going to kill her
just like I did Irina.

29:43.130 --> 29:43.926
Good.

29:43.927 --> 29:46.252
Latuza's office is on the sixth
floor. You'll need to get a key.

29:46.253 --> 29:48.753
Yeah.

29:57.699 --> 30:00.199
What is it?

30:01.707 --> 30:04.207
Dad...

30:12.780 --> 30:15.280
do we have any tranquilizers?

30:15.389 --> 30:17.889
No.

30:20.108 --> 30:22.608
Then I think you better tie me up.

31:00.089 --> 31:02.589
All right, I'm in. Headed upstairs.

31:09.033 --> 31:10.813
I'm gonna be all right, aren't I?

31:10.814 --> 31:13.314
Of course you are.

31:13.590 --> 31:15.196
What if we can't make it stop?

31:15.197 --> 31:16.417
Shh.

31:16.418 --> 31:18.744
Don't talk.

31:18.745 --> 31:21.245
You can't imagine how much I hate it

31:21.451 --> 31:23.535
when you talk.

31:23.536 --> 31:24.522
What?

31:24.523 --> 31:26.367
The reason I killed your mother...

31:26.368 --> 31:28.982
I had a desperate need to make her voice

31:29.074 --> 31:31.524
stop ringing in my ears.

31:31.525 --> 31:33.371
What torments me now

31:33.372 --> 31:35.872
is that every time I look at you,

31:36.277 --> 31:38.169
I see your mother's face.

31:38.170 --> 31:39.627
No.

31:39.628 --> 31:41.417
That's...

31:41.418 --> 31:43.213
that's not true.

31:43.214 --> 31:44.536
That's not...

31:44.537 --> 31:46.718
Sydney, listen to me.

31:46.719 --> 31:49.219
This is all going to pass.

31:52.392 --> 31:54.267
All right, I'm on the
sixth floor. How is she?

31:54.268 --> 31:56.786
We're okay. Just get to the
lab and find the damn antidote.

32:04.866 --> 32:07.814
Sydney, look at me. Breathe.
In and out. That's right.

32:08.887 --> 32:11.453
That's right, just breathe. Good.

32:11.592 --> 32:14.092
Now, look in my eyes.

32:15.134 --> 32:16.840
They're the last thing you'll ever see.

32:16.841 --> 32:18.180
No!

32:18.181 --> 32:20.681
Sydney, I'm here with you.

32:25.789 --> 32:28.289
Sydney, look at me breathe.

32:29.083 --> 32:31.583
Your mother killed me...

32:31.909 --> 32:34.409
just like I'm going to kill you.

32:35.256 --> 32:36.912
I won't let you.

32:36.913 --> 32:38.612
How are you going to stop me?

32:38.613 --> 32:41.113
You're tied up.

32:41.991 --> 32:44.987
Sydney, I'm here with you.
No one is going to harm you.

32:45.265 --> 32:47.765
I won't let anything happen to you.

32:52.667 --> 32:54.395
Dad.

32:54.396 --> 32:56.896
I'm here, Sydney.

32:59.736 --> 33:00.960
Will you hug me?

33:00.961 --> 33:03.461
Of course I will.

33:05.463 --> 33:07.963
It's okay.

33:11.376 --> 33:13.876
Sydney, no!

33:15.343 --> 33:17.512
Jack, can you hear me?

33:17.513 --> 33:19.580
Jack, what is it?

33:19.581 --> 33:22.081
What's happening?

33:58.876 --> 34:01.376
I've got the antidote. I'm on my way.

34:08.199 --> 34:10.081
Help!

34:10.081 --> 34:12.049
Help!

34:12.050 --> 34:14.550
Anybody?

34:14.771 --> 34:17.271
Help!

34:22.531 --> 34:25.031
My father... I think...

34:25.899 --> 34:27.663
Sydney, what did you do?

34:27.664 --> 34:30.164
I think I killed him!

34:39.000 --> 34:40.696
What are you doing?

34:40.697 --> 34:42.614
Get...

34:42.614 --> 34:44.366
Get down.

34:44.367 --> 34:45.686
On your knees.

34:45.687 --> 34:47.675
Sydney, it's Michael.

34:47.676 --> 34:49.951
I've got the antidote.
It's right here in this bag.

34:49.952 --> 34:52.452
Don't lie to me.

34:52.810 --> 34:55.520
Sydney... Sydney, listen to me.

34:55.614 --> 34:57.428
Put your hands up.

34:57.429 --> 34:59.929
Now!

35:01.680 --> 35:04.180
I know what this is.

35:04.878 --> 35:07.378
This is a game to you.

35:07.716 --> 35:10.216
A cruel joke at my expense.

35:10.315 --> 35:11.534
What's a game?

35:11.535 --> 35:14.035
You and me.

35:14.701 --> 35:17.201
Admit it.

35:17.557 --> 35:19.059
No, Sydney.

35:19.060 --> 35:20.709
Sydney, listen to me.

35:20.710 --> 35:22.074
What are you scared of?

35:22.075 --> 35:24.575
I am scared!

35:25.729 --> 35:29.013
I'm scared you're gonna betray me again,

35:29.667 --> 35:32.167
like you did when you married Lauren.

35:32.876 --> 35:35.101
Sydney, I would never,

35:35.102 --> 35:36.377
ever hurt you.

35:36.378 --> 35:38.162
Stop!

35:38.163 --> 35:40.190
Stop right there.

35:40.191 --> 35:41.751
You need to give me the gun, all right?

35:41.752 --> 35:43.870
I said stop!

35:43.871 --> 35:46.371
Just give me the gun.

35:59.148 --> 36:01.648
Sydney, don't...

36:07.671 --> 36:10.171
Sydney, don't do this.

36:10.350 --> 36:12.850
Aah!

36:36.428 --> 36:38.126
You took the bullets out.

36:38.127 --> 36:40.627
It seemed a reasonable precaution.

36:59.786 --> 37:02.972
Preliminary report from medical
services... Sydney will be fine.

37:03.578 --> 37:06.078
For that I know we're
all deeply grateful.

37:06.695 --> 37:08.402
Furthermore, Interpol has raided

37:08.403 --> 37:11.348
both the office and
laboratory of Dr. Milan Latuza.

37:12.471 --> 37:16.371
The Nocturne program
has been dismantled.

37:16.650 --> 37:18.710
That threat is now over.

37:18.711 --> 37:21.211
Okay. That's it.

37:25.388 --> 37:27.888
Dixon?

37:28.435 --> 37:30.935
Sending Sydney out...

37:32.157 --> 37:35.391
a tactical error, indeed.

37:41.859 --> 37:44.902
I'd have said this earlier,
but when I get done,

37:44.994 --> 37:47.318
it's likely you'll have
me relieved of my position,

37:47.319 --> 37:50.125
and I didn't want that to happen
while Sydney was in the field.

37:51.292 --> 37:56.799
I've asked myself countless
times why I never saw

37:56.891 --> 37:59.255
the true nature of SD-6.

37:59.256 --> 38:01.869
For a while, I punished myself over it.

38:02.009 --> 38:05.433
Finally, I realized

38:06.180 --> 38:10.511
my only failure was that of imagination.

38:12.098 --> 38:14.713
Despite all the evil I'd encountered,

38:14.806 --> 38:19.375
I had never imagined
a person could exist...

38:20.776 --> 38:25.680
someone as thoroughly toxic as yourself.

38:27.595 --> 38:30.095
I won't make that mistake again.

38:32.298 --> 38:35.247
You want us to believe you've reformed.

38:35.338 --> 38:37.617
That for the love of your
daughter you've decided to listen

38:37.618 --> 38:40.118
to the better angels of your nature.

38:40.966 --> 38:42.797
Arvin...

38:42.798 --> 38:45.298
let's be honest.

38:45.797 --> 38:48.297
You don't have any.

38:49.691 --> 38:53.210
And on that inevitable day

38:53.536 --> 38:56.818
when your true motive reveals itself,

38:57.611 --> 38:59.956
I promise you

38:59.957 --> 39:02.457
I'll be there.

39:05.811 --> 39:08.311
I'll be waiting.

39:24.719 --> 39:25.680
Hey.

39:25.681 --> 39:28.181
Hey.

39:33.018 --> 39:35.518
Vaughn, what I said to you,

39:35.556 --> 39:38.056
what I did...

39:38.827 --> 39:41.327
Syd, you weren't yourself.

39:42.775 --> 39:45.275
No.

40:15.465 --> 40:16.643
My father liked spiders.

40:16.644 --> 40:19.131
He said they were good luck.

40:19.132 --> 40:21.632
- I've never heard that.
- No?

40:26.964 --> 40:29.464
Get some rest.

40:31.829 --> 40:33.703
I'll see you tomorrow.

40:33.704 --> 40:36.204
Okay.
