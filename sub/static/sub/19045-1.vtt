We have to talk.

Last night was
one of the greatest nights
of my whole life.

10:47.314 --> 10:51.449

I used to live like this
in squalor and filth,

on people, scamming my way
through situations.

Wow! I don't care!
I wanna live
like you again, Charlie.

pathetic and desperate
and ugly and hopeless.

out in the hall.

my cries for help
in the middle of the night.

What's your backstory?

Bro, your backstory.
How'd your legs get crippled?

11:39.099 --> 11:41.566
I don't know.
All right, check mine out.
I had polio. Okay?

11:41.568 --> 11:43.902
That's why I'm rocking
the F.D.R. look with
the blanket and everything.

See, I got a problem.
My legs are really
muscular and athletic.

11:47.941 --> 11:50.208
So nobody's gonna believe
that they're dead.
Okay?

11:50.210 --> 11:53.044
This way, with the blanket,
everyone will assume
that underneath,

and useless.
