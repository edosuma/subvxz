00:05.439 --> 00:07.441
*

00:09.543 --> 00:13.081
* I have a fly on my hands

00:13.114 --> 00:16.450
* Blood on my lips

00:16.484 --> 00:19.620
* I've got blood on my dress

00:19.653 --> 00:24.125
* You ask me questions

00:24.158 --> 00:26.127
* Like you've just been born

00:26.160 --> 00:29.163
* And I told you twice now

00:29.197 --> 00:32.733
* If we go to war

00:32.766 --> 00:34.602
* It's not my problem

00:34.635 --> 00:37.438
* You gonna see my stripes

00:37.471 --> 00:40.174
*

00:40.208 --> 00:42.543
* I won't flinch, won't flinch

00:42.576 --> 00:44.278
* I won't flinch.

00:48.849 --> 00:50.184
Thank you for doing this.

00:50.218 --> 00:51.385
Oh, sweetie...

00:51.419 --> 00:53.454
don't thank me.

01:01.229 --> 01:03.797
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:03.831 --> 01:06.400
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

01:06.434 --> 01:09.103
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:09.137 --> 01:10.204
* How, how, how, how

01:10.238 --> 01:12.206
* Hey, hey

01:18.412 --> 01:19.780
* You gotta come on.

01:21.849 --> 01:23.551
LASALLE:
Yes, sir.

01:23.584 --> 01:24.818
Yes, sir.

01:24.852 --> 01:27.555
I under... No, sir.

01:27.588 --> 01:29.357
I'll do my best.

01:29.390 --> 01:30.691
I got to let you go.

01:30.724 --> 01:32.693
I'm at work. Okay.

01:32.726 --> 01:35.163
Good-bye.
That didn't sound so good.

01:35.196 --> 01:36.730
Was that NCIS HQ?

01:36.764 --> 01:38.232
You in trouble or something?

01:38.266 --> 01:40.768
It wasn't HQ. It was my father.

01:40.801 --> 01:42.670
You talk to your father
like that?

01:42.703 --> 01:43.771
Like what?

01:43.804 --> 01:46.140
"Yes, sir. No, sir."

01:46.174 --> 01:48.142
Yes, ma'am.

01:48.176 --> 01:49.510
Must be a Southern thing.

01:49.543 --> 01:51.345
Well, it's a respect thing.
All right.

01:51.379 --> 01:53.214
How do you talk
to your parents?

01:53.247 --> 01:56.284
We're Italian.
There's a lot of yelling.

01:56.317 --> 01:57.851
Well, Lasalles don't
yell at their parents.

01:57.885 --> 02:00.288
Fair enough.
What's up with Dad?

02:00.321 --> 02:02.623
Uh, he's in town.
Wants to have dinner.

02:02.656 --> 02:04.792
That's nice.
Spend some quality time.

02:04.825 --> 02:07.295
Well, you don't
know my father.

02:07.328 --> 02:08.796
We don't exactly
see eye to eye.

02:08.829 --> 02:10.164
Oh, yeah? Like, on what?

02:10.198 --> 02:13.167
Anything.

02:13.201 --> 02:14.368
Hey, they're here.

02:14.402 --> 02:15.636
Hey.
Hey.

02:15.669 --> 02:17.805
Victim's
Petty Officer Sam Segar.

02:17.838 --> 02:19.340
Electronics tech.

02:19.373 --> 02:21.209
Here for advanced training
at Belle Chasse.

02:21.242 --> 02:22.343
Cleaning lady found
him this morning.

02:22.376 --> 02:23.944
What is this?
A union coffee break?

02:23.977 --> 02:27.181
Ah, kicked everybody
out. Too many comments.

02:27.215 --> 02:28.782
Gruesome in there?
Not exactly.

02:28.816 --> 02:30.351
What is it?

02:32.486 --> 02:34.488
(camera clicking)

02:34.522 --> 02:36.324
WADE:
Autoerotic asphyxiation.

02:36.357 --> 02:38.826
Can't say
I haven't seen it before.

02:38.859 --> 02:41.695
And based on the faded
bruising on our victim's neck,

02:41.729 --> 02:44.232
it wasn't a first time
for him, either.

02:44.265 --> 02:45.666
It is for me.

02:45.699 --> 02:47.735
Out of curiosity,
what's this mirror for?

02:47.768 --> 02:50.204
Oh, it's so that he could
watch himself while he, uh...

02:50.238 --> 02:51.639
you know.

02:51.672 --> 02:53.241
It's pretty common
for the choke and choke set.

02:53.274 --> 02:54.342
Sebastian.

02:54.375 --> 02:56.277
Really?
Sorry.

02:56.310 --> 02:58.512
We're looking at
an accident, then?

02:58.546 --> 03:00.514
SEBASTIAN: Well, this
is an emergency knot.

03:00.548 --> 03:01.749
It's supposed
to be easy to reach

03:01.782 --> 03:02.950
and fashioned
for a quick release

03:02.983 --> 03:04.752
in case you find yourself
passing out.

03:04.785 --> 03:06.654
But this is placed on his back,
and it's bound way too tightly.

03:06.687 --> 03:08.589
You seem to know a lot
about this, Sebastian.

03:08.622 --> 03:10.924
Should we be concerned?
Yes.

03:10.958 --> 03:11.859
No.

03:11.892 --> 03:14.262
I mean, no, you
shouldn't be concerned.

03:14.295 --> 03:16.664
Yes, I know a lot about
AEA. I was just...

03:16.697 --> 03:18.266
I was a big INXS fan as a kid.

03:18.299 --> 03:20.268
When Michael Hutchence died,
I just dealt with my trauma

03:20.301 --> 03:21.935
through intense research.

03:21.969 --> 03:23.337
Fell down a real rabbit hole.

03:23.371 --> 03:24.805
So, we're thinking
it's suspicious?

03:24.838 --> 03:26.574
Hutchence's death was totally
suspicious. I mean, I wrote

03:26.607 --> 03:28.376
a whole high school term...
Sebastian.

03:28.409 --> 03:30.344
He's talking about
Petty Officer Segar's death.

03:30.378 --> 03:32.780
I know that. Now.
The scene's been staged

03:32.813 --> 03:35.683
to look like Petty Officer Segar
was alone,

03:35.716 --> 03:37.585
but someone else
tied these knots.

03:37.618 --> 03:39.620
Some kind of sex
play gone wrong?

03:39.653 --> 03:41.455
If so, somebody cleaned up
really well.

03:41.489 --> 03:44.458
I'm not finding any biologicals
apart from the victim's.

03:44.492 --> 03:46.527
There may be traces
on the body, though.

03:46.560 --> 03:49.297
Can we get the poor kid down now
and find out?

03:49.330 --> 03:51.432
We need to know
who else was in this room

03:51.465 --> 03:52.900
and why they fled.

03:54.735 --> 03:58.306
Sam Segar was born in Detroit,

03:58.339 --> 03:59.473
raised in foster care

03:59.507 --> 04:00.874
until he joined the Navy.

04:00.908 --> 04:02.443
Multiple deployments
over the years.

04:02.476 --> 04:04.312
Arrived in New Orleans
a month ago.

04:04.345 --> 04:05.779
According to his C.O.,
he's got a spotless record.

04:05.813 --> 04:06.880
He's new to the unit,

04:06.914 --> 04:08.282
but he gets along good

04:08.316 --> 04:09.583
with the other sailors.
Now, his next of kin

04:09.617 --> 04:13.354
is Lieutenant Commander
Nolan Willis.

04:13.387 --> 04:15.456
No actual relation. You know,
I'm having a hell of a time

04:15.489 --> 04:16.624
getting in contact with him.

04:16.657 --> 04:18.926
He's on some mission
in San Antonio.

04:18.959 --> 04:20.294
Something classified.

04:20.328 --> 04:21.429
Navy's reaching out
on our behalf.

04:21.462 --> 04:22.896
What about his personal life?

04:22.930 --> 04:25.065
Not much of one. Charges
on his credit card

04:25.098 --> 04:27.067
are for takeout food

04:27.100 --> 04:29.970
and a couple of websites
I've never even heard of.

04:30.003 --> 04:31.138
That's because
it's a specialty site

04:31.171 --> 04:34.442
connecting people interested
in dangling and mangling.

04:34.475 --> 04:36.377
Am I the only one not up
on these euphemisms?

04:36.410 --> 04:37.945
No.
No.

04:37.978 --> 04:40.080
I took a deep dive
into Segar's browser history.

04:40.113 --> 04:42.816
He was in contact with
one woman in particular:

04:42.850 --> 04:45.486
Lady Edgeplay 22.

04:45.519 --> 04:47.455
What kind of contact?
Full kind.

04:47.488 --> 04:48.188
Lot of flirting and foreplay.

04:48.221 --> 04:49.657
Whoever she is,
she worked hard

04:49.690 --> 04:51.492
to get his attention.
And it paid off.

04:51.525 --> 04:52.760
They made plans to meet up.

04:52.793 --> 04:54.362
PRIDE:
Could be the suspect

04:54.395 --> 04:56.330
we're looking for. What
else can you tell us?

04:56.364 --> 04:58.966
Nothing.

04:58.999 --> 05:01.869
Her contact info was scrubbed
from the chat room.

05:01.902 --> 05:03.737
I took a look
into Segar's phone.

05:03.771 --> 05:06.674
I found evidence
of deleted pictures.
I thought you said

05:06.707 --> 05:09.443
no one can actually delete
anything from their phone.

05:09.477 --> 05:11.712
No normal person.
Baby got skills.

05:11.745 --> 05:12.880
Them pictures are gone.

05:12.913 --> 05:14.448
She's technically sophisticated,

05:14.482 --> 05:15.683
worked hard
to get his attention,

05:15.716 --> 05:17.418
and then completely covered
her tracks.

05:17.451 --> 05:18.586
Got to be a reason why.

05:18.619 --> 05:21.489
(phone rings)

05:21.522 --> 05:22.890
It's a shame
you can't recover

05:22.923 --> 05:24.692
any of that information
she deleted, Patton.

05:24.725 --> 05:27.595
Don't sweat it.
I got a few tricks up my sleeve.

05:27.628 --> 05:29.530
(phone rings)
You need to get that?

05:29.563 --> 05:32.099
Uh, definitely not.
Okay.

05:32.132 --> 05:35.603
Get in contact with the sailors
in Segar's unit.

05:35.636 --> 05:37.605
(phone ringing)
If he met a woman,

05:37.638 --> 05:39.106
he might have talked about her.

05:39.139 --> 05:41.341
(phone continues ringing)

05:44.445 --> 05:46.447
You don't answer that,

05:46.480 --> 05:48.015
your dad's gonna just
keep on calling.

05:48.048 --> 05:50.518
How did you...?
All the years we
worked together,

05:50.551 --> 05:52.786
I know what it looks like
when you're ducking family.

05:52.820 --> 05:55.022
(ringing stops)

05:55.055 --> 05:58.726
It's all good. See?

05:58.759 --> 06:01.562
What's he want?

06:01.595 --> 06:03.497
Dinner.

06:03.531 --> 06:05.132
So go.

06:05.165 --> 06:06.834
Gregorio and Percy
can handle Belle Chasse.

06:06.867 --> 06:09.870
No, no. He wants
to have a, uh, talk.

06:09.903 --> 06:11.705
About what?
I don't know.

06:11.739 --> 06:13.474
That's what I'm
worried about.

06:13.507 --> 06:16.677
Eat with your father.
Hear him out.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.512
Is that what you would
do with your father?

06:18.546 --> 06:19.780
(chuckles):
Absolutely not.

06:19.813 --> 06:21.915
But be smarter than me.

06:27.888 --> 06:30.190
Look it here.

06:30.223 --> 06:33.527
Perfectly fine piece of meat
ruined by all this glop.

06:33.561 --> 06:35.963
It's bÃ©arnaise sauce,
and it's the house specialty.

06:35.996 --> 06:37.865
You should at
least taste it.

06:37.898 --> 06:38.866
Christopher,

06:38.899 --> 06:40.133
you with me here?

06:40.167 --> 06:42.836
Oh, yes, sir. Just checking in.

06:42.870 --> 06:45.138
How are things back home?

06:45.172 --> 06:47.040
I already told you.
They're fine.

06:47.074 --> 06:48.175
And your mama's fine, too.

06:48.208 --> 06:49.242
And before
you get into football,

06:49.276 --> 06:52.546
we all have a lot of faith
in Alabama this year.

06:52.580 --> 06:53.981
Now, small talk's done.

06:54.014 --> 06:55.649
Let's get down to it.

06:55.683 --> 06:57.518
How long
you gonna be doing this?

06:59.553 --> 07:01.955
Putting the phone away now, sir.

07:01.989 --> 07:03.791
Not the phone, Christopher.

07:03.824 --> 07:05.626
This job of yours.

07:05.659 --> 07:06.960
My career.

07:06.994 --> 07:08.562
No.

07:08.596 --> 07:10.163
A career is something
that you build.

07:10.197 --> 07:12.600
Something that makes
a contribution to the world.

07:12.633 --> 07:15.469
Been more than
patient with you.

07:15.503 --> 07:18.105
For more than ten years,
actually.

07:18.138 --> 07:20.941
But time's up.

07:20.974 --> 07:22.476
Uh, what is that?

07:22.510 --> 07:23.677
Contract.

07:23.711 --> 07:26.780
Makes you sole proprietor

07:26.814 --> 07:29.550
and chief executive
of Lasalle Enterprises.

07:29.583 --> 07:30.618
That's your job.

07:30.651 --> 07:32.019
For now.

07:32.052 --> 07:33.821
But I'm not gonna
be around forever.

07:33.854 --> 07:35.188
Got to plan for the future.

07:37.224 --> 07:39.860
I'm honored, but, uh...

07:39.893 --> 07:41.562
I can't take the company.

07:41.595 --> 07:42.863
It's a family business.

07:42.896 --> 07:44.832
Last I heard,
you're part of the family.

07:44.865 --> 07:46.266
Yeah, but I got
a life here.

07:46.299 --> 07:49.670
(laughs) I'm sorry.

07:49.703 --> 07:51.204
You got a car payment
and a rental lease.

07:51.238 --> 07:54.107
That's not a life.

07:54.141 --> 07:57.177
Cade can't take care of himself,
let alone the business.

07:57.210 --> 07:59.146
Your mama's
not getting any younger.

07:59.179 --> 08:01.882
My sister, your cousins,
I take care of all them.

08:01.915 --> 08:04.852
When I'm gone,
you're who's left.

08:04.885 --> 08:07.655
Last in the line,
Christopher.

08:09.823 --> 08:11.959
I don't know anything
about the oil business.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.060
Then you better learn.

08:13.093 --> 08:14.628
It's time for you
to step up

08:14.662 --> 08:16.597
and take responsibility.
Your family needs you.

08:16.630 --> 08:18.198
Sir...
I'm done talking about it.

08:18.231 --> 08:19.633
Eat your steak.

08:19.667 --> 08:22.069
SONJA:
We interviewed everyone

08:22.102 --> 08:24.738
at Belle Chasse who had contact
with Petty Officer Segar.

08:24.772 --> 08:26.239
He never mentioned
a girl to them.

08:26.273 --> 08:28.108
Never mentioned anything
about his private life.

08:28.141 --> 08:30.611
I figured he'd keep
his proclivities to himself.

08:30.644 --> 08:32.279
It's probably smart
for his career.

08:32.312 --> 08:33.881
Yeah, but it doesn't
make it any easier

08:33.914 --> 08:35.916
for us to track down this
mystery woman of his.

08:35.949 --> 08:37.651
PATTON:
Easy is for chumps.

08:37.685 --> 08:39.119
We thrive on the impossible.

08:39.152 --> 08:41.922
Our mystery woman
is a mystery no longer.

08:41.955 --> 08:43.691
Meet Chloe Miles,

08:43.724 --> 08:45.593
Segar's playmate
in the chat room.

08:45.626 --> 08:47.761
SONJA: Wait, you were
able to un-delete

08:47.795 --> 08:49.563
the photos from his phone?
Oh, no.

08:49.597 --> 08:51.331
We had to step our game
up a notch.

08:51.364 --> 08:53.333
Hacked into her
shadow profile.

08:53.366 --> 08:54.534
What's a shadow profile?
It's whenever you give

08:54.568 --> 08:57.137
a program permission to access
the photos on your phone,

08:57.170 --> 08:58.906
you're actually allowing it
to access all your data.

08:58.939 --> 09:00.273
And they store that
information on a server.

09:00.307 --> 09:02.676
They got a little something
extra on everybody.

09:02.710 --> 09:05.312
What can you tell us
about Chloe Miles?

09:05.345 --> 09:07.715
She's a real person, for one.

09:07.748 --> 09:09.650
Uh, she's not an alias
or a bot created online.

09:09.683 --> 09:11.318
She met with Segar in
public a few times.

09:11.351 --> 09:12.986
That's where
these first photos came from.

09:13.020 --> 09:14.588
PATTON:
And the final photos

09:14.622 --> 09:16.056
were taken last night
at his apartment.

09:16.089 --> 09:17.858
Proves they were together
before he was killed.

09:17.891 --> 09:19.593
SEBASTIAN: Yeah, and
it gets even scarier.

09:19.627 --> 09:21.595
This isn't her first time.
We found photos connecting Chloe

09:21.629 --> 09:22.863
to three other men.

09:22.896 --> 09:24.064
Each of them were involved

09:24.097 --> 09:25.232
in some type
of Internet subculture.

09:25.265 --> 09:28.068
Each one of them died under
mysterious circumstances.

09:28.101 --> 09:29.603
This is more than a coincidence.

09:29.637 --> 09:30.871
Yeah, the pattern's the same.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.105
Each of the three
victims had no trace

09:32.139 --> 09:33.641
of Chloe in their social media,

09:33.674 --> 09:35.609
but her shadow profile
puts them together

09:35.643 --> 09:36.744
hours before their deaths.

09:36.777 --> 09:37.878
PRIDE:
I've heard enough.

09:37.911 --> 09:39.713
You got an address for her?

09:39.747 --> 09:42.249
Windsor Court Hotel, room 503.

09:50.057 --> 09:51.992
Federal agents! Open the door!

09:54.227 --> 09:55.763
(lock beeps, clicks)

09:55.796 --> 09:59.132
(shower running)

10:08.909 --> 10:11.311
You in the shower,
hands up now.

10:11.344 --> 10:13.146
Put your hands
where we can see them.

10:13.180 --> 10:14.682
Now!

10:14.715 --> 10:16.684
(shower turns off)

10:26.426 --> 10:28.862
Do you really want me
to put my hands up?

10:41.441 --> 10:45.378
You met Petty Officer Segar
online in a chat room

10:45.412 --> 10:47.347
specializing in sexual fetishes?

10:47.380 --> 10:49.783
It's possible.

10:49.817 --> 10:52.052
This is correspondence

10:52.085 --> 10:54.354
between you, making
arrangements to meet.

10:54.387 --> 10:56.389
This is a correspondence

10:56.423 --> 10:59.259
between someone named
Lady Edgeplay 22.

10:59.292 --> 11:02.195
Your screen name.
It could be.

11:02.229 --> 11:03.731
You were with Segar last night
in his apartment,

11:03.764 --> 11:05.198
hours before he was found dead.

11:05.232 --> 11:07.768
If you say so.

11:07.801 --> 11:09.703
Well, this photo says so,
Ms. Miles.

11:09.737 --> 11:12.439
And it wasn't easy finding it,
considering someone

11:12.472 --> 11:15.709
had scrubbed any sign of you
from his phone or computer.

11:15.743 --> 11:17.711
I don't know what your point is.

11:17.745 --> 11:18.779
My point is

11:18.812 --> 11:20.247
Segar died of asphyxiation

11:20.280 --> 11:21.982
in what was made
to look like

11:22.015 --> 11:24.752
a sex game gone wrong.

11:24.785 --> 11:28.321
Unless, of course, it simply
was a sex game gone wrong.

11:28.355 --> 11:29.923
Is that what you're saying
it was?

11:29.957 --> 11:31.992
I couldn't tell you.
I don't know.

11:32.025 --> 11:35.395
What about Taylor Cotton?

11:35.428 --> 11:36.463
Outdoorsman.

11:36.496 --> 11:38.098
You met him
in another chat room.

11:38.131 --> 11:40.267
Invited him to go backpacking
with you in the Rockies.

11:40.300 --> 11:42.402
He drowned in the hot springs.

11:42.435 --> 11:44.271
That sounds awful.

11:44.304 --> 11:45.472
There are others.

11:45.505 --> 11:48.408
Jackson Holt in Hawaii.

11:48.441 --> 11:51.478
Kevin Chung
outside Seattle.

11:51.511 --> 11:54.147
All met similar ends
after making contact with you.

11:55.515 --> 11:57.250
Okay, I admit it.

11:57.284 --> 11:59.086
I'm a travel writer.
I move around the country.

11:59.119 --> 12:00.253
I meet a lot of people.

12:00.287 --> 12:01.521
Do I remember them all? No.

12:01.554 --> 12:04.191
But that's not a crime.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.026
The crime is their murders.

12:06.059 --> 12:08.195
You just said they died
accidentally.

12:08.228 --> 12:11.064
I said their deaths were made
to look like accidents.

12:11.098 --> 12:13.400
GREGORIO:
Hey.

12:13.433 --> 12:15.402
You, uh, survived Dad?

12:15.435 --> 12:17.070
LASALLE:
Yeah.

12:17.104 --> 12:18.939
Though I'm wondering why
y'all didn't reach out to me

12:18.972 --> 12:20.774
after you, uh, arrested
Chloe Miles last night.

12:20.808 --> 12:22.342
Because you were busy at dinner.

12:22.375 --> 12:24.244
And last I heard, I'm still
part of the investigation.

12:24.277 --> 12:25.545
Oh, take it
easy, cowboy.

12:25.578 --> 12:28.215
Nobody's cutting you
out of anything, okay?

12:28.248 --> 12:30.017
We just figured four agents
were enough

12:30.050 --> 12:31.551
to take care of one woman.

12:31.584 --> 12:33.020
Though, maybe
we were wrong.

12:33.053 --> 12:35.255
Pride hasn't gotten
a confession yet?

12:35.288 --> 12:37.124
Nope, and I don't think
he's gonna.

12:37.157 --> 12:38.892
Saying she's innocent?
I-I don't know.

12:38.926 --> 12:41.261
There's something about
this girl. Something's off.

12:41.294 --> 12:43.263
Well, you're the profiler,
Gregorio.

12:43.296 --> 12:45.032
What doesn't add up?

12:45.065 --> 12:46.900
Other than
the many coincidences,

12:46.934 --> 12:48.568
I don't know.
Like she's gone over this

12:48.601 --> 12:50.137
in her head
a million times.

12:50.170 --> 12:53.206
Her reactions are
too well-timed.

12:53.240 --> 12:55.575
That doesn't sound like enough
for an arrest warrant.

12:55.608 --> 12:57.811
No.

12:57.845 --> 13:00.013
But Pride's
not done yet.

13:00.047 --> 13:02.816
You're awfully calm for someone
being accused of four murders.

13:02.850 --> 13:05.853
I guess I'd be more nervous
if I had anything to hide.

13:05.886 --> 13:08.355
Or you had any evidence.

13:08.388 --> 13:10.958
You're looking at the evidence.

13:10.991 --> 13:13.894
No. I'm looking at photos.

13:13.927 --> 13:16.229
There's something else.

13:18.165 --> 13:21.301
Medical examiner...

13:21.334 --> 13:24.537
found foreign DNA
on Segar's body.

13:24.571 --> 13:27.574
Since you got, uh,
nothing to hide,

13:27.607 --> 13:29.242
I'm sure you wouldn't mind if I

13:29.276 --> 13:32.612
swab your DNA?

13:32.645 --> 13:35.949
Be my guest, Agent Pride.

13:39.219 --> 13:40.587
SEBASTIAN:
The DNA we found

13:40.620 --> 13:42.389
on Segar's body
does not match Chloe's.

13:42.422 --> 13:43.390
You're kidding.

13:43.423 --> 13:44.591
Whose DNA is it?

13:44.624 --> 13:46.193
No one's at the moment.

13:46.226 --> 13:48.095
It's not coming up in any
of the standard searches.

13:48.128 --> 13:50.063
I'm expanding to more
classified databases,

13:50.097 --> 13:51.999
but I'm not optimistic.

13:52.032 --> 13:53.533
Everything in me
says she's our killer.

13:53.566 --> 13:55.268
Yeah, but we don't have
anything on her.

13:55.302 --> 13:56.603
Maybe we could keep her
for another day.

13:56.636 --> 13:58.505
Keep trying to break her down.

13:58.538 --> 14:00.073
No, that woman's
not gonna break.

14:00.107 --> 14:02.409
Gregorio, escort her
back to her hotel,

14:02.442 --> 14:04.077
keep an eye on her.

14:04.111 --> 14:05.913
We'll figure out another way
to take her down.

14:05.946 --> 14:08.248
If we can't get her to talk,
we got to focus on the victims.

14:08.281 --> 14:10.250
Percy and Patton have been
trying to get more details,

14:10.283 --> 14:11.919
find a connection between them.

14:11.952 --> 14:13.186
What if there
is no connection?

14:13.220 --> 14:15.188
What if all these murders
are just random?

14:15.222 --> 14:19.292
If I know one thing from sitting
across from Chloe Miles,

14:19.326 --> 14:22.295
she doesn't do anything
randomly.

14:22.329 --> 14:24.631
PATTON: Four male victims from
different parts of the country,

14:24.664 --> 14:26.199
age, ethnic background.

14:26.233 --> 14:28.435
LASALLE: And seemingly
only one thing in common:

14:28.468 --> 14:30.670
Chloe Miles.
Actually,
there's something else.

14:30.703 --> 14:33.140
The three other victims,
Taylor Cotton, Jackson Holt

14:33.173 --> 14:35.675
and Kevin Chung had top secret
security clearances.

14:35.708 --> 14:37.610
Well, nothing in their files
suggested they worked

14:37.644 --> 14:40.613
for the government.
Not officially,
but each one was a contractor

14:40.647 --> 14:43.283
for either the NSA,
the CIA or the DIA.

14:43.316 --> 14:45.018
That changes everything.
MICE.

14:45.052 --> 14:46.219
Where?

14:46.253 --> 14:47.620
SEBASTIAN:
No, uh...

14:47.654 --> 14:49.156
It's an acronym
that FLETC taught us.

14:49.189 --> 14:51.224
It's the four motives
for stealing secrets.

14:51.258 --> 14:53.493
Money, Ideology,
Coercion, Ego.

14:53.526 --> 14:56.429
Oh, we know she had a ego
going for her.

14:56.463 --> 14:58.098
So, Chloe is some sort of spy.

14:58.131 --> 14:59.933
Getting close enough
to these contractors

14:59.967 --> 15:01.601
to steal intel and kill them.

15:01.634 --> 15:03.703
Yeah, except Petty Officer Segar
doesn't fit the pattern.

15:03.736 --> 15:05.939
He was a electronics tech.

15:05.973 --> 15:08.275
Didn't... no special clearance,
no access to intel.

15:08.308 --> 15:10.310
Chloe had a reason
to go after him.

15:10.343 --> 15:11.711
Maybe it was geography.

15:11.744 --> 15:14.247
Three contractors in Colorado,
Washington state,

15:14.281 --> 15:15.949
and Hawaii.

15:15.983 --> 15:18.418
All three have
NSA outposts.

15:18.451 --> 15:19.987
But New Orleans doesn't.

15:20.020 --> 15:23.056
I mean, the closest NSA
station is San Antonio.

15:23.090 --> 15:24.992
Mm, San Antonio.

15:25.025 --> 15:26.593
Segar's next of kin,

15:26.626 --> 15:30.263
Lieutenant Commander Willis,
is on mission in San Antonio.

15:30.297 --> 15:31.698
Something classified.

15:31.731 --> 15:33.967
Navy wouldn't even give me
his direct contact.

15:34.001 --> 15:36.003
Just like these other victims.

15:36.036 --> 15:37.237
(cell phone chiming)

15:37.270 --> 15:38.972
It's Wade. She might
have something.

15:39.006 --> 15:40.740
I'm running a check
on Willis right now.

15:40.773 --> 15:42.742
Zero presence
on social media

15:42.775 --> 15:44.444
and I can't even
find a picture on him.

15:44.477 --> 15:46.079
Well, suggests he's way up
the food chain.

15:46.113 --> 15:48.015
SEBASTIAN: So, Chloe kills
Petty Officer Segar

15:48.048 --> 15:50.117
to what? To draw Willis out?

15:50.150 --> 15:51.985
SONJA: And it looks
like it worked.

15:52.019 --> 15:53.286
According to Wade,

15:53.320 --> 15:55.022
Commander Willis just arrived
in New Orleans

15:55.055 --> 15:56.556
to make arrangements
for Segar's body.

15:58.691 --> 16:01.694
WILLIS: When I got the call,
I just couldn't believe it.

16:01.728 --> 16:05.298
Sam and I grew up together
in the foster system.

16:07.800 --> 16:10.337
The closest thing either
one of us had to family.

16:10.370 --> 16:12.705
We're very sorry
for your loss, Commander.

16:12.739 --> 16:16.609
Nobody will tell me anything
about how this happened.

16:16.643 --> 16:19.046
Do you recognize this woman?

16:19.079 --> 16:19.746
No.

16:19.779 --> 16:22.682
Chloe Miles.

16:22.715 --> 16:25.085
We believe she murdered
Petty Officer Segar

16:25.118 --> 16:27.054
and tried to make it
look like an accident.

16:27.087 --> 16:28.455
Why would she kill Sam?

16:28.488 --> 16:29.689
LASALLE: We've connected
her to three other

16:29.722 --> 16:31.691
mysterious deaths.

16:31.724 --> 16:33.260
Each victim working
for the government

16:33.293 --> 16:34.594
with top secret clearance.

16:34.627 --> 16:36.429
Sam wasn't involved
in intelligence.

16:36.463 --> 16:37.564
PRIDE:
No, we think

16:37.597 --> 16:40.267
she targeted him to get to you.

16:40.300 --> 16:44.071
The other victims,
Taylor Cotton,

16:44.104 --> 16:45.305
Jackson Holt,
Kevin Chung.

16:45.338 --> 16:48.108
Any of those names
sound familiar?

16:48.141 --> 16:49.609
Look, I'm detached to DoJ
legal counsel right now.

16:49.642 --> 16:50.543
I have review privileges
on dozens of operations.

16:50.577 --> 16:52.612
There's hundreds of
personnel involved.

16:52.645 --> 16:54.781
Even if I did
recognize those names,

16:54.814 --> 16:56.049
I wouldn't be allowed
to tell you.

16:56.083 --> 16:57.517
DoD is in the process
of reading us in

16:57.550 --> 16:59.052
on all their assignments.

16:59.086 --> 17:01.121
PRIDE: We're gonna need you
to do the same.

17:01.154 --> 17:03.390
Come to NCIS.
Help us sort this out.

17:03.423 --> 17:05.158
Please.

17:05.192 --> 17:08.161
Yeah, I...

17:08.195 --> 17:09.829
I'll put in a call
to my commanding officer,

17:09.862 --> 17:13.700
but I need to be free tonight
to pay my respects to Sam.

17:13.733 --> 17:15.635
What's happening tonight?

17:15.668 --> 17:18.571
Memorial service being held
by his unit.

17:21.541 --> 17:24.111
I'll be the only family there.

17:31.884 --> 17:35.555
If Chloe killed Segar
to draw Willis out,

17:35.588 --> 17:37.590
the memorial service
is the best place for her

17:37.624 --> 17:38.758
to make contact with him.

17:38.791 --> 17:40.427
We could set up a sting.

17:40.460 --> 17:43.830
Send Willis in wired,
catch her in the act.

17:43.863 --> 17:45.232
She killed four men
in the last six months.

17:45.265 --> 17:47.100
Too risky putting him
in harm's way.

17:47.134 --> 17:48.701
All right,
so we don't put him in.

17:48.735 --> 17:49.636
Willis has been scrubbed
out the Internet.

17:49.669 --> 17:51.671
Chloe doesn't have a
clue what he looks like.

17:51.704 --> 17:53.106
You mean send in
a ringer?

17:53.140 --> 17:55.342
Who, Christopher?
She's been to NCIS.

17:55.375 --> 17:57.144
She's seen us.
Not me.

17:57.177 --> 17:58.878
I was at dinner
with my father.

17:58.911 --> 18:03.316
No. No, you have no idea
how much she knows about Willis.

18:03.350 --> 18:05.418
There's no time
to prepare you.

18:05.452 --> 18:06.619
Look, I'll wear an earwig.

18:06.653 --> 18:07.820
All right, Willis
can listen in.

18:07.854 --> 18:09.756
We'll make it work.

18:09.789 --> 18:11.691
I appreciate your enthusiasm,

18:11.724 --> 18:14.127
but I'm worried
your head's not in the game.

18:14.161 --> 18:15.695
You're too distracted.

18:15.728 --> 18:16.829
You...
(cell phone rings)

18:16.863 --> 18:19.599
Case in point.
What?

18:19.632 --> 18:21.634
My father? (scoffs)

18:21.668 --> 18:23.870
Come on. Yeah, he's a
pain in the rear end,

18:23.903 --> 18:26.839
for sure, but I got my eye
on the ball here, all right?

18:26.873 --> 18:29.142
I want to catch this girl
before she kills again.

18:29.176 --> 18:30.610
Unless she kills you, too.

18:30.643 --> 18:33.180
Which, I must admit,
she's quite skilled at.

18:33.213 --> 18:35.215
This woman is
extremely dangerous.

18:35.248 --> 18:36.849
LASALLE: She caught
those men by surprise.

18:36.883 --> 18:39.452
All right? I'll be going in
knowing what I'm dealing with.

18:39.486 --> 18:40.553
Unless you don't.

18:40.587 --> 18:41.888
These toxicology reports

18:41.921 --> 18:44.824
suggest all four of our victims

18:44.857 --> 18:47.160
were dosed with
succinylcholine.

18:47.194 --> 18:48.695
It's a paralytic.

18:48.728 --> 18:51.864
Mossad uses it
in assassinations.

18:51.898 --> 18:53.566
So I won't let her inject me.

18:53.600 --> 18:56.536
What about the unidentified DNA
on Segar's body?

18:56.569 --> 18:58.305
Chloe may have
an accomplice.

18:58.338 --> 19:01.174
I'll be at a memorial service.
We'll have backup there.

19:01.208 --> 19:03.476
King, this is
what we do.

19:03.510 --> 19:07.146
Plus, it's not like we
got a lot of options.

19:11.851 --> 19:13.853
(somber jazz music playing)

19:24.897 --> 19:26.566
LASALLE:
All right, I'm in.

19:26.599 --> 19:29.936
See a lot of uniforms,
but no sign of Chloe.

19:29.969 --> 19:33.806
Gregorio and Sonja said she left
the hotel 20 minutes ago.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.908
Parked down the street.
GREGORIO:
She's got to be inside.

19:35.942 --> 19:37.677
We saw her go in.
SONJA: Yeah, and if we're right,

19:37.710 --> 19:38.911
she'll find you.

19:38.945 --> 19:40.980
I'll make my way to the bar.
Try to blend in.

19:41.013 --> 19:43.316
PATTON:
Don't blend in too much.

19:43.350 --> 19:45.652
Got to keep your wits
around this girl.

19:45.685 --> 19:46.953
Already got a father
in town, Patton.

19:46.986 --> 19:49.422
Thanks for the advice.

19:49.456 --> 19:51.758
Ooh. Hey.

19:51.791 --> 19:53.926
CHLOE:
I am so sorry.

19:53.960 --> 19:55.628
Oh, it's okay.

19:55.662 --> 19:56.996
I-I feel so awful.

19:57.029 --> 19:58.598
Let me pay for
your dry cleaning.

19:58.631 --> 20:00.267
It's the least I can do.

20:00.300 --> 20:03.370
Oh, how about buying me
a drink instead?

20:03.403 --> 20:07.507
Well, the-the drinks
are-are free here.

20:07.540 --> 20:10.310
Then it's your
lucky night, Miss...

20:10.343 --> 20:12.245
Chloe Miles.

20:12.279 --> 20:14.981
You're Commander Willis,
Sam's older brother.

20:15.014 --> 20:19.319
Wow, I have heard
so much about you.

20:19.352 --> 20:22.255
Call me Nolan.

20:24.824 --> 20:26.959
CHLOE: Well, let's get
that drink, Nolan.

20:26.993 --> 20:28.961
Target's engaged.

20:28.995 --> 20:31.298
Lasalle's just got to
get her on the hook.

20:31.331 --> 20:32.799
Yeah, and now we just need him

20:32.832 --> 20:35.268
to reel her in
before she takes him out.

20:49.582 --> 20:51.318
I'm glad to
meet you, Nolan.

20:51.351 --> 20:53.486
Nobody here
really knew Sam.

20:53.520 --> 20:56.289
It's good to have someone
to talk to about him.

20:56.323 --> 20:57.724
You and Sam were...?

20:57.757 --> 20:58.958
Friends.

20:58.991 --> 21:01.428
Oh, he never mentioned me?

21:01.461 --> 21:02.595
No.

21:02.629 --> 21:04.797
I'm sorry.
I've been busy, though,

21:04.831 --> 21:06.899
and we haven't talked
in a while.

21:06.933 --> 21:09.936
Oh, that's okay. We were just
getting to know each other.

21:09.969 --> 21:11.938
He sure talked
about you.

21:11.971 --> 21:14.574
Looking out for him
the way you did growing up...

21:14.607 --> 21:15.808
(laughs)

21:15.842 --> 21:18.044
How much he idolized you...

21:18.077 --> 21:20.413
It's so special.

21:20.447 --> 21:22.515
The way she turns on the
sweetness and vulnerability,

21:22.549 --> 21:23.983
you'd never know
she killed four men.

21:24.016 --> 21:27.053
Can't decide if I'm impressed
or terrified.

21:27.086 --> 21:29.589
PRIDE:
Stay focused there.
Mm-hmm.

21:29.622 --> 21:32.625
Anything goes wrong, you're
Lasalle's last line of defense.

21:32.659 --> 21:35.595
He was the closest
thing I had to family.

21:35.628 --> 21:37.564
We looked out for each other.

21:37.597 --> 21:39.766
"Partners in crime"
is how he put it. (chuckles)

21:39.799 --> 21:42.602
Well, from everything
he told me,

21:42.635 --> 21:44.771
you were a good
big brother.

21:44.804 --> 21:46.506
Yeah, not good enough.

21:46.539 --> 21:49.442
Wish I was here
when he needed me most.

21:49.476 --> 21:52.612
CHLOE: There's no worse feeling
in the world.

21:52.645 --> 21:55.515
Knowing somebody you love
died alone.

21:55.548 --> 21:58.084
Sounds like you got
experience with it.

21:58.117 --> 22:00.687
You lose a sibling, too?

22:00.720 --> 22:02.589
My father.

22:02.622 --> 22:04.524
LASALLE:
I'm sorry.

22:04.557 --> 22:06.593
What happened?

22:06.626 --> 22:09.028
This isn't about me.

22:09.061 --> 22:11.598
Tonight is about Sam.

22:11.631 --> 22:13.666
Come on.

22:13.700 --> 22:16.068
Let's do another round.

22:16.102 --> 22:18.104
We can toast to him.

22:22.942 --> 22:25.445
You got all that
about her father, right?

22:25.478 --> 22:26.846
PRIDE:
Could be a play for sympathy

22:26.879 --> 22:28.881
or she could be
telling us the truth.

22:28.915 --> 22:31.684
Either way, she wants you
to ask her about it.

22:31.718 --> 22:33.620
Let's see where she's taking us.

22:33.653 --> 22:34.754
And remember, Christopher,

22:34.787 --> 22:36.856
don't trust anything she says.

22:36.889 --> 22:39.426
I'm all over it, King.

22:42.462 --> 22:43.896
Here you go.

22:45.164 --> 22:46.566
Thank you.

22:46.599 --> 22:47.534
To Sam.

22:47.567 --> 22:50.937
One of the good ones.
GREGORIO: Be careful

22:50.970 --> 22:53.406
of that next drink.
Yeah, no idea
what she dosed it with.

22:53.440 --> 22:54.407
GREGORIO:
Yeah.

22:54.441 --> 22:56.375
To Sam.

23:05.985 --> 23:08.120
SEBASTIAN:
Pride, you got a moment?

23:08.154 --> 23:10.590
Lasalle's dad's here.

23:10.623 --> 23:11.758
Great timing,
right?

23:11.791 --> 23:14.160
Keep a close eye
on Christopher.

23:16.663 --> 23:18.665
Mr. Lasalle.

23:18.698 --> 23:21.534
I'm Dwayne Pride. Pleasure
to finally get to meet you.

23:21.568 --> 23:23.703
Where's Christopher?
I been calling him all day.

23:23.736 --> 23:26.839
Yeah, um, I'm afraid he's
tied up at the moment.

23:26.873 --> 23:28.841
What's he doing?

23:28.875 --> 23:31.010
Unfortunately,
I can't tell you.

23:31.043 --> 23:33.646
And I need to get
back to it myself.

23:33.680 --> 23:35.014
But I will let
him know...
I get it.

23:35.047 --> 23:38.217
Y'all cover each other's backs
while he tries

23:38.250 --> 23:39.886
to avoid his father.

23:39.919 --> 23:42.154
Actually, he's working a case.

23:42.188 --> 23:43.823
If he could be here...

23:43.856 --> 23:45.224
He still wouldn't.

23:45.257 --> 23:47.026
I know my son.

23:47.059 --> 23:50.062
Though probably not as well
as you do these days.

23:50.096 --> 23:53.800
Like I said, we are a little
busy around here at the moment.

23:53.833 --> 23:56.636
This is Christopher's desk,
right?

23:56.669 --> 23:58.605
(scoffs)

23:58.638 --> 24:02.675
Ten years, and this is
the culmination of his career.

24:03.776 --> 24:06.245
Christopher is great at his job.

24:06.278 --> 24:07.914
Well, he certainly spends
enough time doing it.

24:07.947 --> 24:09.949
Do you know
how many holidays

24:09.982 --> 24:11.651
he's missed over the years?

24:11.684 --> 24:14.821
Birthdays, Thanksgiving,
Christmases.

24:14.854 --> 24:15.855
Because he was here.

24:15.888 --> 24:17.690
We're like a family.

24:17.724 --> 24:20.760
"Like a family" is not
the same as an actual family.

24:20.793 --> 24:23.630
A wife, children.

24:23.663 --> 24:25.031
You know what I'm talking about?

24:25.064 --> 24:27.667
I do.
I have a daughter.

24:27.700 --> 24:29.769
And what do you want
for her, Mr. Pride?

24:29.802 --> 24:32.138
You want her in a job
with no future?

24:32.171 --> 24:35.675
Risking her life,
never coming home.

24:35.708 --> 24:37.777
I want her to be happy.

24:37.810 --> 24:40.847
I want my son to grow up,
take responsibility,

24:40.880 --> 24:43.516
make something of himself.

24:43.550 --> 24:46.586
But I don't have the influence
over him that you do.

24:51.257 --> 24:54.226
You know...

24:54.260 --> 24:57.229
Christopher makes
his own choices.

24:57.263 --> 24:59.231
And for the record,

24:59.265 --> 25:02.669
he's one of the best agents
I've ever worked with.

25:02.702 --> 25:04.837
He makes a difference every day

25:04.871 --> 25:06.673
he wears the badge.

25:06.706 --> 25:08.675
I wouldn't know.

25:08.708 --> 25:10.242
He never talks to me about it.

25:10.276 --> 25:13.145
If you see my son,

25:13.179 --> 25:15.815
tell him I was here.

25:18.284 --> 25:20.953
CHLOE:
It wasn't a normal childhood.

25:20.987 --> 25:23.790
I was a military brat,
so we moved around a lot.

25:23.823 --> 25:25.758
My dad was all I had.

25:25.792 --> 25:26.893
No mom?

25:26.926 --> 25:28.761
No, she died
when I was a baby.

25:28.795 --> 25:32.932
Then my dad, he got a new job
working for the government.

25:32.965 --> 25:34.066
Started traveling alone.

25:34.100 --> 25:36.703
What kind of job?

25:36.736 --> 25:39.739
Well, Nolan...

25:39.772 --> 25:43.876
I could tell you,
but then I'd have to kill you.

25:43.910 --> 25:46.813
Oh. That kind of job.

25:46.846 --> 25:50.216
You're familiar with it?

25:50.249 --> 25:52.184
I could tell you, but...

25:52.218 --> 25:54.854
Oh. No. Fair enough.

25:54.887 --> 25:56.756
We need information
on Chloe's dad,

25:56.789 --> 25:58.357
and we need it fast.
Got it.

25:58.390 --> 26:01.227
Captain James Miles, former
Air Force helicopter pilot.

26:01.260 --> 26:02.028
You ever hear of this guy?

26:02.061 --> 26:03.896
No, but I'll look into it.
Then go.

26:03.930 --> 26:05.865
Yeah, yeah.
CHLOE: Dad was gone

26:05.898 --> 26:08.367
more often than he was around,
and then,

26:08.400 --> 26:09.769
when he was around, he...

26:09.802 --> 26:11.070
He was always working.

26:11.103 --> 26:12.772
Yeah.

26:12.805 --> 26:14.941
I was angry at him.

26:14.974 --> 26:16.876
I wanted to rebel.

26:18.911 --> 26:20.780
How'd he die?

26:20.813 --> 26:23.382
The official story:

26:23.415 --> 26:27.754
he was in Paraguay
working as a pilot for an NGO.

26:27.787 --> 26:29.856
Went out drinking
one night.

26:29.889 --> 26:31.924
Stabbed to death in a bar fight.

26:31.958 --> 26:33.192
Paraguay. Bar
fight. Anything.

26:33.225 --> 26:34.393
Come on.
LASALLE:
Do you think that's true?

26:34.426 --> 26:36.796
Check it.
CHLOE: I know it's not.

26:36.829 --> 26:37.964
My father didn't drink.

26:37.997 --> 26:39.231
Not a drop
in his life.

26:39.265 --> 26:41.233
And he wouldn't ever
get into a bar fight.

26:41.267 --> 26:44.671
The government made that up
to cover up the truth.

26:44.704 --> 26:46.138
Well, what's the truth?

26:46.172 --> 26:47.974
State secret.

26:48.007 --> 26:51.610
I've been trying
to find out for three years.

26:53.846 --> 26:57.216
I feel very close to you.

26:57.249 --> 27:01.320
Maybe it's because
you were so tight with Sam.

27:01.353 --> 27:04.156
(chuckles) Or maybe it's
the three drinks talking.

27:04.190 --> 27:05.758
(chuckles)

27:07.894 --> 27:10.897
I feel close to you, too.

27:10.930 --> 27:14.867
Sam, he-he told me
about what you do for the Navy.

27:14.901 --> 27:16.936
I know he shouldn't have,

27:16.969 --> 27:19.772
but when he found out
what happened to my father,

27:19.806 --> 27:21.774
he thought that maybe
you could...

27:21.808 --> 27:22.942
I could...?

27:24.944 --> 27:26.713
(whispers):
I'm sorry.

27:26.746 --> 27:27.947
This is...

27:27.980 --> 27:29.348
this is wrong.

27:29.381 --> 27:30.850
What?

27:30.883 --> 27:32.318
I'm sorry.

27:32.351 --> 27:34.020
I-I've said too much, and I...

27:34.053 --> 27:35.087
and I-I drank too much.

27:35.121 --> 27:37.223
It-it was nice to meet you,
Nolan.

27:41.293 --> 27:43.162
She's gone.

27:43.195 --> 27:44.997
What just happened?

27:45.031 --> 27:46.198
Did she spot Gregorio or Percy?

27:46.232 --> 27:47.399
GREGORIO:
No. No way.

27:47.433 --> 27:49.401
We're a block away,
with eyes on her car.

27:49.435 --> 27:51.470
Yeah, this-this has got to be
part of her game.

27:51.503 --> 27:52.972
I'm going after her.

27:53.005 --> 27:55.007
PRIDE: No, no, no.
Take a beat, Christopher.

27:55.041 --> 27:56.843
That's exactly what she wants
you to do.

27:56.876 --> 27:57.944
Look, King,

27:57.977 --> 27:59.779
I was this close
to getting what we need.

27:59.812 --> 28:00.980
You won't have backup.

28:01.013 --> 28:03.049
If something happens to me,
you can find me.

28:03.082 --> 28:04.951
I'm carrying a tracking device.

28:04.984 --> 28:07.720
Gregorio, Percy,
get eyes on him.

28:09.055 --> 28:10.990
Chloe, wait.

28:11.023 --> 28:14.060
I made a fool of
myself back there.

28:14.093 --> 28:16.495
I know how important family is.

28:16.528 --> 28:19.131
And you want to find out
about your dad.

28:20.166 --> 28:22.301
I have to find out.

28:22.334 --> 28:24.203
Then tell me
what you were gonna ask.

28:24.236 --> 28:26.072
Maybe I can help.

28:37.483 --> 28:39.318
You're definitely
gonna help.

28:39.351 --> 28:41.921
What did you do?

28:41.954 --> 28:43.990
Don't fight it.

28:44.023 --> 28:45.224
Just come with me.

28:45.257 --> 28:47.493
(panting)

28:50.029 --> 28:51.463
We just lost contact.

28:51.497 --> 28:52.464
Something happen
to his hat?

28:52.498 --> 28:53.933
Christopher, you there?

28:53.966 --> 28:54.967
Percy, Gregorio,

28:55.001 --> 28:55.935
somebody talk to me.

28:55.968 --> 28:58.470
Where's Lasalle?
Where the hell
did they go?

28:58.504 --> 28:59.972
SONJA: We found his hat.
That means he doesn't have

29:00.006 --> 29:02.108
his tracking device.
Christopher!

29:02.141 --> 29:04.243
She had another car!

29:04.276 --> 29:06.979
Pride, I think
we lost her!

29:17.189 --> 29:18.991
Surveillance. BOLO.
Talk to me.

29:19.025 --> 29:20.860
Well, Chloe Miles took
Lasalle in a silver sedan,

29:20.893 --> 29:23.062
and Gregorio and Percy
are searching the area.

29:23.095 --> 29:24.897
But no sign yet.

29:24.931 --> 29:26.432
So you got nothing.
Keep working.

29:26.465 --> 29:28.534
We got to find them.

29:28.567 --> 29:30.436
What'd you find out
about Chloe's father?

29:30.469 --> 29:31.871
James Miles was CIA.

29:31.904 --> 29:34.040
Part of a covert operation
called Chaos.

29:34.073 --> 29:36.175
And what is Chaos?
The Triple Frontier.

29:36.208 --> 29:37.543
It's a border junction
between Paraguay,

29:37.576 --> 29:39.378
Argentina and Brazil.

29:39.411 --> 29:41.247
It's a hotbed for terrorist
and criminal activity.

29:41.280 --> 29:42.849
And the government's
cracking down?

29:42.882 --> 29:44.884
Joint task force
across the agencies.

29:44.917 --> 29:46.352
There's hundreds of agents
involved.

29:46.385 --> 29:48.287
Including Chloe's father.
Yeah.

29:48.320 --> 29:50.923
Well, what was he doing there?
How... And how did he die?

29:50.957 --> 29:51.958
How did he really die?

29:52.992 --> 29:54.961
I can't say.

29:54.994 --> 29:56.562
You do realize that,
if it wasn't for us,

29:56.595 --> 29:58.064
you wouldn't be sitting there.

29:59.431 --> 30:01.968
Chloe's killed four men,
kidnapped one of my agents.

30:02.001 --> 30:04.904
It has something to do
with her father.

30:04.937 --> 30:06.572
Now, drop the secret agent act!

30:10.342 --> 30:12.411
Miles was building a rapport

30:12.444 --> 30:14.613
with one of the leaders
of a terrorist group.

30:14.646 --> 30:15.982
His cover was blown.

30:16.015 --> 30:17.884
They held him hostage.

30:17.917 --> 30:20.319
They sent in a demand
for a million-dollar ransom.
And you said no.

30:20.352 --> 30:23.055
No, not me. The decision
went all the way to the top.

30:23.089 --> 30:24.456
And the answer was clear.

30:24.490 --> 30:26.092
We don't negotiate
with terrorists.

30:26.125 --> 30:28.861
And we were not gonna let it
jeopardize the mission.

30:28.895 --> 30:30.930
What about jeopardizing
Miles's life?

30:30.963 --> 30:34.233
It was deemed
an acceptable loss.

30:34.266 --> 30:36.903
Not to Chloe.

30:36.936 --> 30:40.973
She targeted you and the others
to get to the truth.

30:41.007 --> 30:43.976
It's not just
the truth. Look...

30:44.010 --> 30:47.513
I have access to the names of
the officials who made the call.

30:49.916 --> 30:51.583
That's what she wants
out of Lasalle.

30:51.617 --> 30:53.519
And when she finds out

30:53.552 --> 30:56.889
that he's not you,
she's gonna kill him.

30:56.923 --> 30:58.424
(sighs)

30:59.926 --> 31:02.962
How would she get you
to access that file?

31:12.304 --> 31:14.573
CHLOE: Don't waste
your energy, Nolan.

31:14.606 --> 31:17.543
Those zip ties won't budge.

31:17.576 --> 31:19.145
Chloe.

31:20.646 --> 31:22.348
What are you doing?

31:22.381 --> 31:25.451
I need you to log in.

31:25.484 --> 31:26.685
(Lasalle grunts)

31:26.718 --> 31:28.454
You need to untie me.

31:28.487 --> 31:31.190
Let's not waste time.

31:31.223 --> 31:33.592
You won't have much left
if you don't help.

31:35.995 --> 31:37.964
Look, all right, you're upset.

31:37.997 --> 31:39.531
You're not thinking clearly.

31:39.565 --> 31:41.633
I couldn't be clearer.

31:44.036 --> 31:46.638
Those represent three lives.

31:46.672 --> 31:48.174
Three men who
worked with you.

31:48.207 --> 31:52.044
They wouldn't help me,
and now they're dead.

31:52.078 --> 31:53.679
But I still got their log-ins,

31:53.712 --> 31:56.015
which led me
to your identity.

31:56.048 --> 31:58.985
So don't martyr yourself.

32:03.089 --> 32:04.323
Log in,

32:04.356 --> 32:08.160
and pull up
Operation Chaos.

32:08.194 --> 32:09.996
Look, I-I...

32:10.029 --> 32:12.131
I don't know what that is.

32:12.164 --> 32:13.732
(shouts)
Log in!

32:13.765 --> 32:15.201
Log in now!
Okay.

32:15.234 --> 32:16.635
Second I log in,

32:16.668 --> 32:19.038
my command will be able
to track me.

32:19.071 --> 32:20.706
Let me worry about that.

32:20.739 --> 32:22.174
Type!

32:28.080 --> 32:29.081
(computer alarm beeping)

32:29.115 --> 32:30.749
What did you just do?

32:30.782 --> 32:32.551
Who's C. Lasalle?

32:32.584 --> 32:35.154
Undercover identity
for the operation.

32:35.187 --> 32:37.723
I must've miskeyed
the password.

32:37.756 --> 32:40.026
PATTON:
Lasalle's alive!

32:40.059 --> 32:42.094
I put a breach alert
on a classified site

32:42.128 --> 32:43.262
Chloe once accessed.

32:43.295 --> 32:44.463
Lasalle just tried to log in

32:44.496 --> 32:45.497
using his real name.

32:45.531 --> 32:46.732
He's sending us a signal.

32:46.765 --> 32:49.068
Do you have a location?
I'm working on it.

32:49.101 --> 32:50.736
SEBASTIAN: He only has
a few log-in attempts left

32:50.769 --> 32:52.171
before he's locked
out of the system.

32:52.204 --> 32:53.639
Chloe will kill him
if that happens.

32:53.672 --> 32:56.042
Type slower.

33:00.546 --> 33:02.114
We need to buy Lasalle
some time.

33:02.148 --> 33:04.150
We could give him access
to Commander Willis's log-in.

33:04.183 --> 33:06.585
Yes.
What? No. Not possible.

33:06.618 --> 33:09.021
Oh, it's possible. You just need
to give us your information.

33:09.055 --> 33:10.356
She'll get intel
on the whole operation.

33:10.389 --> 33:11.790
The identities
of hundreds of agents

33:11.823 --> 33:14.260
still in the field
will be exposed to our enemies.

33:14.293 --> 33:16.495
They could die. No.
That is too much exposure.

33:16.528 --> 33:18.130
It's not worth the risk.

33:18.164 --> 33:18.764
(typing)

33:18.797 --> 33:20.332
(computer alarm beeping)

33:21.700 --> 33:24.136
You need to take me
seriously, Nolan.

33:24.170 --> 33:26.438
I am taking you seriously.

33:26.472 --> 33:29.508
Four men are already dead,
including your brother.

33:29.541 --> 33:32.078
Their lives weren't
"acceptable losses,"

33:32.111 --> 33:33.579
and neither is Lasalle's.

33:35.147 --> 33:36.515
I don't know.

33:38.117 --> 33:40.152
PATTON: Zeroed in
on his signal, Pride.

33:40.186 --> 33:41.053
Got Lasalle's location.

33:41.087 --> 33:43.589
We'll stop Chloe
from utilizing the intel.

33:43.622 --> 33:46.325
But we need your help
to keep Lasalle alive.

33:49.628 --> 33:53.065
Look, I-I understand how your
father's death affected you.

33:53.099 --> 33:55.467
How could you?

33:55.501 --> 33:57.703
You don't have a father.

33:57.736 --> 33:59.805
You don't know
what it's like

33:59.838 --> 34:02.708
to have the only person
who cared for you die alone.

34:02.741 --> 34:05.644
He should have died a hero,
not a drunk, Nolan!

34:05.677 --> 34:07.846
You're not responsible
for what happened.
No!

34:07.879 --> 34:09.248
You are!

34:09.281 --> 34:11.650
Log in now!

34:11.683 --> 34:14.153
Okay, I will. I will.

34:26.265 --> 34:28.167
(whispers):
Yes.

34:28.200 --> 34:29.835
You're in.

34:33.139 --> 34:34.306
(panting)

34:34.340 --> 34:36.142
Thank you, Nolan.

34:38.244 --> 34:41.147
Lasalle successfully logged in
a few minutes ago.

34:41.180 --> 34:43.215
But the signal died.
You guys got to hurry.

34:45.884 --> 34:48.354
(tires screech)

34:48.387 --> 34:50.689
Chris is in this
ship. Eyes open.

34:50.722 --> 34:52.591
Chloe might still be here.

35:00.232 --> 35:01.233
SONJA:
Christopher!

35:02.801 --> 35:03.869
Oh, my God!

35:03.902 --> 35:06.138
He's got no pulse.

35:20.386 --> 35:22.688
PRIDE: Come on, Christopher,
give me something.

35:22.721 --> 35:25.224
You've been doing this for
three minutes, 35 seconds.

35:25.257 --> 35:26.658
We got to get him
out of here, Pride.

35:26.692 --> 35:28.360
The EMTs are five minutes away,

35:28.394 --> 35:29.828
but NOPD can rush him
to the hospital.

35:29.861 --> 35:30.896
We don't have
that much time.

35:30.929 --> 35:33.165
God...
What did she do to him?!

35:33.199 --> 35:34.600
GREGORIO:
Burst blood vessel,

35:34.633 --> 35:36.568
puncture mark on his neck,
syringe on the floor.

35:36.602 --> 35:37.703
Made it look like
an overdose.

35:37.736 --> 35:39.571
That's it.
Gregorio, take over.

35:39.605 --> 35:41.473
All right, come on.

35:41.507 --> 35:43.175
Come on, come on.

35:46.578 --> 35:49.515
Officer! You got an updated
ER kit in your trunk?

35:49.548 --> 35:52.251
Yes, sir.
What do you need?
Narcan syringe, now.

35:52.284 --> 35:53.885
(panting):
All right.

35:53.919 --> 35:57.323
Come on, come on.
Come on, come on.

35:58.557 --> 35:59.625
Come on, buddy.

35:59.658 --> 36:01.693
Gregorio,
get out of the way!

36:02.994 --> 36:04.563
WOMAN (recorded):
Three, two, one.

36:04.596 --> 36:06.332
(Lasalle gasps)
(all shouting)

36:06.365 --> 36:07.966
No, no, no. It's us,
it's us. It's us.

36:07.999 --> 36:09.201
It's us, Christopher.

36:09.235 --> 36:10.469
Wh-What the hell happened?

36:10.502 --> 36:11.670
You just came back
from the dead.

36:11.703 --> 36:13.205
You had to make a scene, huh?

36:13.239 --> 36:15.307
(panting) Chloe.

36:15.341 --> 36:17.609
Chloe, she's-she's ran off
with Willis's data.
Yeah, we know.

36:17.643 --> 36:19.445
We know. We know.
We got to get her!

36:19.478 --> 36:20.779
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

36:20.812 --> 36:22.348
What you got to do
is listen

36:22.381 --> 36:23.915
to what the paramedics
tell you to do, all right?

36:23.949 --> 36:26.485
Here you go. You got him?
We'll take care of Chloe.

36:26.518 --> 36:28.320
Patton and Sebastian
got a bead on our girl.

36:28.354 --> 36:29.955
She hasn't gone that far!

36:29.988 --> 36:31.690
Take care of him!

36:31.723 --> 36:33.859
(exhales) Okay.

36:40.666 --> 36:41.867
PRIDE:
Won't need that luggage.

36:41.900 --> 36:43.769
You're not leaving here today.

36:43.802 --> 36:45.771
GREGORIO: Hey. Come on, move.
SEBASTIAN: Get out, get out.

36:45.804 --> 36:47.773
Get out, get out.
Move, move, move on.

36:47.806 --> 36:48.807
CHLOE:
You're too late.

36:48.840 --> 36:51.877
In a few moments,
Operation Chaos goes public.

36:51.910 --> 36:54.446
And everyone will then
know the truth.

36:54.480 --> 36:55.914
We're not gonna
let that happen.

36:59.585 --> 37:01.620
We'll see.

37:01.653 --> 37:03.322
Put the gun down, Chloe.

37:03.355 --> 37:04.556
It's not worth
any more bloodshed.

37:04.590 --> 37:07.259
It's absolutely worth it.

37:07.293 --> 37:08.627
People deserve to know
the truth!

37:08.660 --> 37:09.928
PRIDE:
No matter the cost?

37:09.961 --> 37:12.030
Hundreds of other agents' lives
are at stake

37:12.063 --> 37:13.665
if you let that upload complete.

37:13.699 --> 37:15.501
CHLOE:
I'm not the bad guy here!

37:15.534 --> 37:17.436
I'm just righting a wrong!

37:17.469 --> 37:18.904
PRIDE: There are children
who will lose parents

37:18.937 --> 37:21.473
because you're righting a wrong.

37:21.507 --> 37:24.910
Not to mention the blood
already on your hands.

37:24.943 --> 37:26.812
All because you decided it.

37:29.981 --> 37:31.783
What happened?
What happened?!

37:31.817 --> 37:32.884
We cut the power.

37:32.918 --> 37:34.753
No! No! No!

37:34.786 --> 37:35.854
It's over, Chloe.
Put down the gun.

37:35.887 --> 37:37.489
I can't.

37:37.523 --> 37:38.824
She's gonna make a move, Pride.

37:38.857 --> 37:40.992
Is this what your father
would have wanted?

37:41.026 --> 37:43.862
You to go down in a hail
of bullets for him?

37:46.898 --> 37:49.435
He was all I had.

37:49.468 --> 37:52.571
And you think somehow he'll be
seen as a hero when this ends?

37:52.604 --> 37:53.705
I don't care.

37:53.739 --> 37:57.008
Just do it.
Shoot me. Shoot me.

37:57.042 --> 37:59.010
Shoot me
or I'll shoot you instead!

37:59.044 --> 38:00.546
Do it!

38:00.579 --> 38:01.580
PRIDE:
No.

38:02.914 --> 38:05.751
No, not this way.

38:05.784 --> 38:07.586
Don't give up on him.

38:07.619 --> 38:10.722
Put down your weapon.

38:10.756 --> 38:12.090
Stop the killing.
(crying)

38:12.123 --> 38:13.759
You do that for me,
and I promise,

38:13.792 --> 38:17.095
the truth of his
heroism will come out.

38:17.128 --> 38:18.630
(panting)

38:28.039 --> 38:30.075
(sobs)

38:40.519 --> 38:42.854
LASALLE: Appreciate you
coming to pick me up, King.

38:42.888 --> 38:44.790
I'm good to
get myself home.

38:44.823 --> 38:46.625
Well, your heart stopped
for four minutes.

38:46.658 --> 38:48.126
You were basically dead.

38:48.159 --> 38:50.128
Figure that earns you
a free ride.
(car alarm chirps)

38:50.161 --> 38:51.830
(scoffs)
Yeah, well,

38:51.863 --> 38:54.500
I would be dead if
it wasn't for you.

38:54.533 --> 38:56.668
You saved my life.
I owe you one.

38:56.702 --> 38:58.036
Well, I'm glad
you feel that way,

38:58.069 --> 38:59.571
'cause I'm calling in
that chit.

38:59.605 --> 39:00.772
I'm not taking you home.

39:00.806 --> 39:02.574
I'm taking you to see your dad.

39:02.608 --> 39:04.009
King, no.

39:04.042 --> 39:06.512
Yes, Christopher.

39:06.545 --> 39:08.013
Uh, maybe you
were right.

39:08.046 --> 39:09.948
You know, I was basically dead.

39:09.981 --> 39:11.650
I should rest up.

39:11.683 --> 39:13.919
You need to face your father.

39:15.987 --> 39:17.889
There's no point.

39:17.923 --> 39:19.791
He wants me to take over
the family business.

39:19.825 --> 39:21.059
All right? I'm not gonna.

39:21.092 --> 39:22.728
So tell him.

39:23.862 --> 39:25.897
Why's it matter so much to you?

39:25.931 --> 39:29.167
'Cause I've been where you are.

39:29.200 --> 39:31.537
Don't make
the same mistakes I made.

39:31.570 --> 39:32.971
Talk to your father.

39:35.040 --> 39:37.409
It's not like
anything will change.

39:37.443 --> 39:39.711
Maybe.

39:40.879 --> 39:43.949
Maybe that's
not the point.

39:48.487 --> 39:51.857
Went through a lot to avoid
seeing me the last couple days.

39:51.890 --> 39:53.559
That's not what
happened here, sir.

39:53.592 --> 39:54.926
Mr. Pride told me.

39:54.960 --> 39:58.196
You put yourself on the line
to save a lot of others.

39:58.229 --> 40:01.099
That's what we do.

40:01.132 --> 40:03.034
I just don't understand
why you do it.

40:03.068 --> 40:05.937
You got prospects at home.
A business with a future.

40:05.971 --> 40:08.139
Look, I'm gonna stop you
right there, Dad.

40:09.775 --> 40:12.644
That business is not my future.

40:12.678 --> 40:14.012
And it never will be.

40:14.045 --> 40:16.715
All right, no matter how
many speeches you give me

40:16.748 --> 40:19.585
about family
or responsibility,

40:19.618 --> 40:22.488
or whatever else
you want to talk about,

40:22.521 --> 40:24.756
I'm happy here.

40:24.790 --> 40:27.793
You can like it,
you can hate it,

40:27.826 --> 40:29.795
but that's the fact
of the matter.

40:33.865 --> 40:36.802
Let's order a couple more
of those steaks.

40:36.835 --> 40:38.504
No fancy sauce this time.

40:38.537 --> 40:39.871
I'm starving.

40:39.905 --> 40:42.908
Uh, you know what? Uh...

40:42.941 --> 40:45.544
I guess I just wasn't
as hungry as I thought.

40:49.948 --> 40:51.617
