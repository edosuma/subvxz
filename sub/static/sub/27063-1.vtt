01:57.485 --> 01:58.645
And...

02:30.565 --> 02:33.365
That's good, Charlotte.

02:37.845 --> 02:42.325
Thank you.
Out on the floor, and spread out.

02:47.925 --> 02:50.005
All right.

02:50.565 --> 02:53.645
Ida, what was your grade
on the latest math test?

02:53.725 --> 02:55.085
An A.

02:55.165 --> 02:56.245
A?

02:58.525 --> 03:02.965
- It doesn't really help you here, does it?
- No.

03:08.045 --> 03:15.045
Vanessa. With your butt, maybe
you should try pole dancing instead?

03:15.605 --> 03:16.645
Amalie...

03:23.805 --> 03:24.845
Amalie...

03:27.005 --> 03:31.365
Two things are required of you.
1: Know your steps.

03:31.445 --> 03:37.365
2: Put yourselves on display
in your dance. Come across.

03:37.445 --> 03:40.325
To us, who sit here watching you.

03:42.045 --> 03:46.765
But when I look at you, Amalie...
I see nothing.

03:46.845 --> 03:51.885
You don't communicate anything.
It's like you're completely empty.

03:53.085 --> 03:57.285
- But I thought I did everything correctly.
- Correctly? What's that?

03:59.685 --> 04:02.125
Correctly...

04:02.205 --> 04:07.245
Ida, if you can't take criticism,
you shouldn't be here.

04:10.405 --> 04:12.485
Her cat is dead.

04:14.685 --> 04:19.325
- What are you saying?
- That's why she is sad.

04:19.445 --> 04:22.205
Her cat is dead? I see.

04:22.285 --> 04:23.765
Thanks.

04:23.845 --> 04:25.845
Charlotte. Good.

04:25.965 --> 04:29.645
At least you were technically superior.
But...

04:30.405 --> 04:33.965
Until tomorrow, think of what I said.
That was all for today.

04:41.525 --> 04:45.805
Hope she gets laid soon and
gets rid of some of her frustration.

04:45.885 --> 04:46.725
Bitch.

04:46.805 --> 04:48.885
She's not a bitch towards Charlotte.

04:52.285 --> 04:54.925
We're trying to find the perfect mix
between comfort and speed.

04:55.005 --> 04:58.325
You can chill,
have a beer, go swimming...

04:58.405 --> 05:02.205
- And then pop up fast when needed.
- Right. That'll be cool.

05:02.285 --> 05:04.685
Hi.

05:04.765 --> 05:07.005
- How was class?
- Really good.

05:07.085 --> 05:09.805
- Did you have a good time?
- Yes.

05:09.925 --> 05:13.285
- Did you have fun?
- Yes.

05:13.365 --> 05:15.765
Anyone for swimming?

05:32.165 --> 05:34.325
No! Stop!

05:34.405 --> 05:37.005
Knock it off!

05:43.365 --> 05:45.645
- Cold, Vanessa?
- Yes.

06:01.525 --> 06:04.365
- Who's that?
- No idea.

06:05.765 --> 06:09.765
Good morning, everybody.

06:12.965 --> 06:17.045
Bashir was my student...

06:30.325 --> 06:35.605
For a long time,
Bashir and I have wanted to collaborate.

06:35.685 --> 06:42.285
And now Bashir has reserved
a place for one of you,

06:42.365 --> 06:44.885
who may attend his school
for a whole year.

06:46.645 --> 06:49.205
Quiet!

07:18.645 --> 07:22.765
I saw an opera performance, and a lot
of people from that school were in it.

07:22.845 --> 07:25.245
It's insane!

07:25.325 --> 07:28.005
May we practice
at your place, Charlotte?

07:37.245 --> 07:40.525
Hello! Everything okay?

07:40.605 --> 07:43.045
Come in.

08:27.925 --> 08:29.165
Good morning.

08:29.885 --> 08:34.565
- Good morning. Up early?
- Going to the Netherlands, you know.

08:34.645 --> 08:36.924
That's great, little warrior.

08:37.005 --> 08:41.445
Charlotte has got herself a dance gym.
In the basement.

08:41.525 --> 08:43.085
That's why she's so good.

08:47.165 --> 08:49.965
We don't use the basement
for anything.

08:54.325 --> 08:57.445
Maybe we should
get ourselves a dance gym?

09:00.925 --> 09:04.685
Maybe you could talk to our carpenter?

09:04.765 --> 09:08.045
Think about it, Dad. Bye!

09:34.365 --> 09:36.765
Shit...

09:43.165 --> 09:46.805
Is this what you mean? Like this?

09:46.925 --> 09:51.245
- I challenge you to do butterfly.
- You know how to do butterfly?

09:53.565 --> 09:55.925
You're so incredibly lucky
to have all this.

09:56.845 --> 10:00.005
Yes, new money can also be a good thing.

10:00.485 --> 10:04.565
If she didn't have the pool, we wouldn't
have the most awesome parties.

10:05.805 --> 10:10.205
Right, we have to start planning
the party. Got to top last year’s party.

10:10.285 --> 10:13.525
Let's start the pre-party right now.

10:13.605 --> 10:17.365
- Here you are.
- No, thanks, not while I'm training.

10:17.445 --> 10:19.485
Me neither.

10:19.565 --> 10:24.045
I can drink the whole bottle
if it's such a big deal.

10:24.125 --> 10:26.965
There's already a glass for me.

10:27.045 --> 10:30.005
Hi!

10:30.085 --> 10:33.045
I have to ask you to leave.
I'm really sorry.

10:35.205 --> 10:40.845
- What? But we just got here.
- My fault. I should have told you.

10:40.925 --> 10:43.925
I’m expecting some people, you see.

10:44.005 --> 10:48.725
- We'll continue the party at my place.
- Is it okay? Super.

10:48.805 --> 10:51.605
- No problem.
- That's great.

10:51.685 --> 10:54.925
Just help yourselves from the cellar.

10:55.005 --> 10:57.805
Amalie.
It would be good if you’d stay behind.

10:57.925 --> 11:00.765
- Why?
- I'll tell you later.

11:00.845 --> 11:04.725
- Enjoy yourselves, folks!
- Bye. See you later, Bjørn.

11:04.805 --> 11:08.165
- You'll come around later?
- Yes. I'll call you.

11:08.245 --> 11:10.965
- Got everything? The bottles?
- Of course!

11:12.565 --> 11:15.365
You've got to tell me
if you're expecting guests.

11:15.445 --> 11:18.045
It's so embarrassing
to throw my friends out!

11:22.725 --> 11:25.725
Did you talk to the carpenter?
About the dance gym?

11:28.365 --> 11:29.445
Hello?

11:38.205 --> 11:40.285
There's a lot of people outside.

11:45.965 --> 11:47.445
What's happening?

11:49.765 --> 11:50.845
Yes...?

11:55.005 --> 11:57.445
It's...

12:04.605 --> 12:06.765
Hi.

12:06.845 --> 12:10.485
We're from the Enforcement Office.
Do you know why we're here?

12:12.165 --> 12:15.085
Yes. But there's no need for this.

12:15.165 --> 12:18.125
I'm getting a loan
and will settle with the creditors.

12:18.205 --> 12:22.205
You have had every opportunity
to do so. Now it's too late.

12:22.285 --> 12:25.925
Either you let us in
or we ask for assistance from the police.

12:27.685 --> 12:29.125
Here you are.

12:29.845 --> 12:32.205
- What's happening?
- Just relax.

12:32.285 --> 12:35.245
- Hi. Do you live here?
- Yes.

12:35.325 --> 12:39.525
This property will be abandoned.
Show me your room so we can pack.

12:39.605 --> 12:41.045
Dad?

12:41.125 --> 12:44.565
Bring all personal belongings.
All sensitive information.

12:44.645 --> 12:48.125
Toilet articles, things you need...

12:54.125 --> 12:56.525
You may enter now.

12:58.925 --> 13:02.725
- How long will we be gone?
- This house will be sold.

13:02.805 --> 13:06.445
- Is it possible to speed it up?
- Pack your things.

13:06.525 --> 13:12.565
Two jackets should be enough.

13:12.685 --> 13:15.365
- But this is my sailing jacket.
- Two jackets.

13:15.445 --> 13:18.725
An official receiver
will decide what can be sold.

13:18.805 --> 13:22.805
- My things will be sold?
- The official receiver will decide.

13:22.885 --> 13:26.725
- Telephone, PC, passport...
- Passport?

13:27.205 --> 13:29.485
Everything containing
personal information.

13:48.165 --> 13:52.685
It's nothing dramatic.
It's just a situation has come up...

13:52.765 --> 13:56.005
Do a final check upstairs. Excuse me!

13:56.085 --> 13:58.445
- Just a moment.
- No. Start packing.

13:58.525 --> 14:01.245
- I'll just finish this conversation.
- No. Now.

14:01.325 --> 14:04.445
All sensitive information.
Toilet articles. Things you need.

14:04.525 --> 14:06.405
Now.

14:12.285 --> 14:15.765
SEALED

14:29.805 --> 14:32.485
Can't we just check in to a hotel?

15:45.925 --> 15:47.285
Dad...

15:58.285 --> 16:00.045
Bloody hell.

16:01.325 --> 16:02.325
God damn it.

16:04.885 --> 16:07.645
There's only one bed.

16:07.725 --> 16:11.645
Well, I can sleep here. But...

16:11.725 --> 16:13.845
Damn, this place...

16:13.965 --> 16:16.525
Hello? This is Bjørn Viksjø.

16:16.605 --> 16:22.605
I've arrived at the apartment you've
given us. There must be some mistake.

16:26.405 --> 16:32.245
We live in Norway.
Not some bloody developing country.

16:32.645 --> 16:36.805
Okay, I see. All right. Thank you.

16:38.125 --> 16:39.765
Dad. What's going on?

16:42.485 --> 16:44.925
Foreclosure?

16:45.445 --> 16:48.765
Amalie, I've got a...

16:48.845 --> 16:53.445
I've got a little liquidity problem,
so I'm short of cash.

16:53.525 --> 16:58.125
- But what happened?
- Well...

17:00.925 --> 17:03.365
They bankrupted me.

17:03.445 --> 17:09.685
Bankrupt? But don't you have
a lot of shares you can sell?

17:09.765 --> 17:12.805
No. I actually
sold them a long time ago.

17:19.444 --> 17:25.165
It was this apartment project at Geilo.
I thought I shoould manage, but...

17:27.204 --> 17:31.245
They will set up
a debt management plan.

17:31.325 --> 17:33.565
- Debt management plan?
- Yes.

17:33.645 --> 17:36.405
The authorities
will take control for a period.

17:37.285 --> 17:40.325
- For how long?
- Five years.

17:40.405 --> 17:44.405
Five years?!
Are we going to live here for five years?

17:48.565 --> 17:52.765
Of course it won't be five years.
I'll take care of this.

17:52.845 --> 17:56.085
I'll just get a new loan,
and then we’ll move back.

17:56.165 --> 17:58.325
This will work out fine. Don't worry.

18:00.845 --> 18:03.685
Where will I have dancing space?

18:05.085 --> 18:09.085
How about here in the living room?
We don't need more furniture.

18:09.165 --> 18:12.725
It's a stone floor. I can't dance here.

18:15.445 --> 18:17.845
I'm sorry, Amalie.

18:45.645 --> 18:47.525
READY?

18:47.605 --> 18:50.045
SORRY... HAVE TO HELP DAD WITH THE GUESTS.

19:17.605 --> 19:20.565
Yes, this is kind of awkward.

19:20.645 --> 19:26.165
That's why I'm calling. I helped you
out of the gutter a few times.

19:40.605 --> 19:44.765
IDA: WHERE WERE YOU?
SHE WENT THROUGH ALL THE SEQUENCES.

19:48.165 --> 19:49.965
Ill.

19:52.285 --> 19:55.805
IDA: CHARLOTTE IS HALFWAY
TO THE NETHERLANDS...

20:23.165 --> 20:26.965
- You're going to school today?
- Yes.

20:27.045 --> 20:31.925
Have you talked to your friends
about... this?

20:32.005 --> 20:34.525
Are you out of your mind?

21:10.205 --> 21:11.885
Good.

21:13.925 --> 21:16.885
Inhale deeply with every breath.

21:16.965 --> 21:19.645
It makes your movements deeper.

21:23.845 --> 21:27.325
Does anyone want to show us
yesterday's sequence?

21:29.405 --> 21:30.685
Sorry. The bus was late.

21:32.125 --> 21:36.565
How kind of you to show up.
I really appreciate it. Thank you.

21:36.645 --> 21:40.325
And just in time
to show us the sequence.

21:42.645 --> 21:43.965
Come on. We're waiting.

21:59.285 --> 22:04.565
- Sorry. I didn't get to warm up properly.
- I think you look pretty warm.

22:04.645 --> 22:06.805
- I'll do it again.
- No.

22:06.925 --> 22:10.925
We don't want to see you rehearse what
you should have practiced at home.

22:11.005 --> 22:12.005
Charlotte, come.

22:14.525 --> 22:15.525
Yes.

22:22.765 --> 22:23.925
That's it.

22:26.405 --> 22:29.405
See how lightly she flows. She's flying.

22:37.405 --> 22:44.125
I've been negotiating this so much
that I can brief you. No problem.

22:44.205 --> 22:50.205
Because those people are a bit...
They're inspired by Russian tactics.

22:50.285 --> 22:53.725
They don't say anything. Just that...

23:04.525 --> 23:06.365
INDIVIDUAL TRAINING

23:24.125 --> 23:26.845
YOUTH CENTER

23:54.365 --> 23:56.565
YOUTH CENTER

24:14.725 --> 24:17.285
Hi.

24:17.365 --> 24:22.205
- Hi. What's up?
- I just wondered...

24:22.285 --> 24:25.925
Is it okay if I practice here?

24:27.005 --> 24:31.765
Well, that's what it's meant for.
Just come in.

25:54.925 --> 25:55.925
Shit!

25:58.725 --> 26:04.325
You know... Whenever I get stuck,
I just do something different.

26:04.405 --> 26:06.645
- Would you like to?
- Yes.

26:06.725 --> 26:10.005
All right. Introduction course to hip hop.

26:10.085 --> 26:11.205
First you'll need shoes.

26:15.205 --> 26:19.285
Okay. The first move is Steve Martin.

26:19.805 --> 26:22.845
Turn, rocker. Three, four...

26:22.965 --> 26:25.965
Five, six. Bart Simpson.

26:26.045 --> 26:32.125
Then you slide. Back.
One, two, three, four.

26:32.205 --> 26:37.365
Then three quick ones.
Running man. Down.

26:37.445 --> 26:40.285
Yes. And continue.

26:40.365 --> 26:43.925
And one, and two...

26:44.965 --> 26:46.365
Hello...

26:47.645 --> 26:49.445
No?

26:49.525 --> 26:53.765
Sorry.
I know there are names and things...

26:53.845 --> 26:57.365
You know what? Let's just dance.

26:59.405 --> 27:01.965
Shuffles!

27:12.245 --> 27:15.325
1, 2, 3...

27:46.845 --> 27:48.765
Nice!

27:48.845 --> 27:52.805
- Where did you learn to dance?
- I attend Valkyrien. Modern.

27:54.805 --> 27:59.685
- And you're ready for something more?
- Maybe.

28:07.325 --> 28:10.605
Yo, guys! What's up?

28:16.485 --> 28:18.805
- Hello.
- Hi.

28:18.925 --> 28:21.565
- Moa.
- Amalie.

28:21.645 --> 28:24.485
- Nice.
- Mikael!

28:25.045 --> 28:28.405
Hi. What's up?

28:28.525 --> 28:32.125
- Hi. I'm Kim.
- Amalie.

28:32.205 --> 28:35.925
- Will you join our training?
- No. I have to go.

28:37.365 --> 28:38.365
Okay.

28:39.325 --> 28:42.045
- Mikael, come here.
- Nice eardrops.

28:43.885 --> 28:46.805
What kind of music do you want?

28:46.885 --> 28:52.485
So, what are you up to tomorrow?
Nothing? No? Awesome.

28:52.565 --> 28:56.205
Because I thought
you could join us for something.

28:56.285 --> 28:58.525
Okay? Like what?

28:58.605 --> 29:03.365
Nyland at eight o'clock.
At <i>The World. </i> Be there.

29:03.445 --> 29:07.085
- What happens there?
- You'll see tomorrow. Be there.

29:07.765 --> 29:09.765
Just come.

29:10.645 --> 29:13.885
Hey, you... Girl.
What was your name again?

29:13.965 --> 29:15.965
Amalie.

29:16.045 --> 29:18.645
You know there's a door there?

29:18.725 --> 29:21.725
- You know, open, exit.
- Yes. I just...

29:21.805 --> 29:26.085
Beginners’ course or what?
Don't take his course. Mikael is shit.

29:26.165 --> 29:29.565
Follow my course. Magic Moa.

29:29.645 --> 29:33.805
- I have to go now.
- Okay. Bye. See you.

29:33.925 --> 29:36.925
Don't take a course with any of them.

29:38.925 --> 29:41.445
Did you hook up or what?

29:55.845 --> 29:57.965
That's all for today.

30:31.205 --> 30:35.805
<i>Hi, you have reached Amalie.
Leave a message. Talk to you later!</i>

30:35.925 --> 30:38.845
<i>Hello?
Where are you?</i>

30:38.965 --> 30:43.965
<i>I've been looking everywhere.
I've called Ida. I'm outside your house.</i>

30:44.045 --> 30:45.165
<i>Call me back.</i>

31:01.245 --> 31:04.325
AKSEL: HELLO...? WEREN'T WE
SUPPOSED TO MEET?

32:18.125 --> 32:20.645
Hey! Cool that you came here!

32:20.725 --> 32:24.565
- What's happening?
- This, Amalie, is a battle.

32:34.685 --> 32:38.325
- That's it?
- "That's it"?

32:38.405 --> 32:42.245
You realize that this is not
choreographed? It's freestyle, Amalie.

32:42.325 --> 32:46.165
- Freestyle?
- Yes! They didn't even know the tune.

32:46.245 --> 32:50.245
They don't know who they'll meet
or when they'll meet them.

32:50.325 --> 32:52.885
You just enter the stage
when you're called.

32:52.965 --> 32:55.645
And then you just live out a moment.

32:56.205 --> 32:58.765
Speaking of a moment... Watch this.

33:17.885 --> 33:20.845
She kills it. It's insane.

34:07.125 --> 34:11.284
Say hello to the rest of the crew. Come.

34:11.364 --> 34:13.045
Moa, remember Amalie?

34:16.605 --> 34:19.804
Who do you think will win?
They're voting now.

34:19.925 --> 34:22.565
The ladies...?

34:26.485 --> 34:29.005
Bergen knows her stuff!

34:29.085 --> 34:31.844
Marlenita and Mariken
go on to the finals!

34:31.965 --> 34:36.645
Are you ready for
All-Star Battle, 1 versus 1?

35:02.605 --> 35:06.005
You know, we're a crew,
and we're friends.

35:06.085 --> 35:12.525
But when we battle, we get all the
shit out, you know. Provoke each other.

35:13.245 --> 35:16.245
Some people may get angry.

35:16.725 --> 35:20.245
Like, last week, someone got shot.

35:20.325 --> 35:24.525
What? Seriously?

35:25.445 --> 35:27.205
Hello?

35:28.485 --> 35:31.685
- Fuck you.
- You're easily fooled!

35:54.525 --> 35:58.325
People!
Groruddalen, make some noise!

35:58.405 --> 36:03.645
Show some love for the dancers,
Moa and Alex from the Illicit crew!

36:03.725 --> 36:07.285
Are you with me, folks?

36:07.365 --> 36:10.125
One, two, three...

36:11.645 --> 36:15.365
- Moa and Alex, from the Illicit crew!
- What does that mean?

36:15.445 --> 36:20.205
That means there's a draw.
Altogether one vote more for Moa.

36:23.085 --> 36:28.125
- Will you battle?
- I'm here to see someone else battle.

36:28.205 --> 36:29.325
Who?

36:34.685 --> 36:35.805
No...

36:35.925 --> 36:40.125
- I promise, you'll do great!
- I can't!

36:40.205 --> 36:45.965
You'll be so good!
This is the coolest thing in the world!

36:46.045 --> 36:52.685
Don't stress. Just be yourself.
Be honest about it, right?

36:54.605 --> 36:56.405
Take this off. It will get hot.

37:15.405 --> 37:18.085
- He's damn good.
- He's just a kid.

37:26.725 --> 37:28.965
Ten seconds, Jojo.

37:40.365 --> 37:41.965
Jojo, folks!

37:45.725 --> 37:48.045
Come on, Amalie.

38:09.525 --> 38:11.285
Okay, okay.

38:11.365 --> 38:14.605
- I can't do this.
- You're doing great.

39:12.365 --> 39:15.765
That's bite! What are you doing?

39:15.845 --> 39:19.605
- Bite! Bite!
- That's my move!

39:20.365 --> 39:22.725
Bite, Amalie!

39:25.285 --> 39:29.485
It's all right. Don't mind them.

39:30.525 --> 39:32.605
Amalie?

39:32.685 --> 39:34.045
Amalie!

39:34.645 --> 39:37.645
Amalie! Stop!

39:37.725 --> 39:41.925
- Why did you do that?
- I thought you'd like it.

39:42.005 --> 39:45.005
How could you think
someone would enjoy this?

39:45.085 --> 39:48.565
- I made a total fool of myself!
- I know, but...

39:48.645 --> 39:51.685
It's supposed to be fun, okay?

39:54.405 --> 39:57.005
Not for me.

39:58.365 --> 39:59.565
Fuck.

40:28.565 --> 40:30.525
AKSEL
CALL ME

40:49.725 --> 40:52.885
- Hi.
<i>- Okay, so you didn't smash your phone?</i>

40:52.965 --> 40:56.765
- I won't be like that again. Okay?
<i>- I waited so long.</i>

40:56.845 --> 41:00.485
<i>I sent thousands of messages.
It's really bad behavior.</i>

41:00.565 --> 41:02.805
Aksel, I...

41:04.405 --> 41:08.405
Sorry that I've been shit.

41:08.485 --> 41:10.485
Sorry.

41:14.925 --> 41:18.485
<i>There'll be nice weather tomorrow.
I'm looking forward to it.</i>

41:30.765 --> 41:32.445
Hello.

41:40.365 --> 41:43.445
I guess I overslept.

41:45.205 --> 41:47.325
- Going out?
- I'll go sailing.

41:53.165 --> 41:56.125
Will you do
some decent shopping soon?

41:56.205 --> 41:58.605
Sure.

41:58.685 --> 42:02.685
- Bring your sailing jacket. It's cold.
- I don't have a sailing jacket!

42:02.765 --> 42:04.205
They took everything!

42:06.685 --> 42:10.205
Dad, stop lying to everyone!

42:11.725 --> 42:13.725
You're creating your own world.

42:17.045 --> 42:21.285
Listen, the audition...
I'm really nervous.

42:22.965 --> 42:28.925
Like, doomsday
over the whole audition day.

42:29.005 --> 42:33.005
Just hold a steady course
and watch out for the boat over there.

42:35.245 --> 42:37.445
Amalie, you must be freezing your ass off.

42:37.525 --> 42:39.045
No, I'm good.

42:39.125 --> 42:42.325
- No jacket?
- You need a jacket.

42:42.405 --> 42:47.725
- I forgot it at home.
- Mom's got one. Let's go find it.

43:05.565 --> 43:08.365
MIKAEL SENT YOU A FRIEND REQUEST

43:17.165 --> 43:21.645
MIKAEL: THAT WAS TOTALLY
WRONG OF ME. I'M SORRY.

43:25.285 --> 43:27.845
MIKAEL: THIS TUNE SAYS IT BETTER
THAN I CAN.

43:27.925 --> 43:29.725
YOMI: UNNSKYLD (SORRY)

43:38.085 --> 43:40.205
Hi.
Ready?

43:43.165 --> 43:45.165
Everyone's got a chance.

43:45.245 --> 43:47.965
- Hey...
- What?

44:01.965 --> 44:04.285
I have to go back to the others.

44:09.765 --> 44:12.245
MIKAEL: DID YOU LIKE THE TUNE?

44:15.205 --> 44:17.365
CONFIRM FRIEND REQUEST

44:17.445 --> 44:21.565
- Who are you talking to?
- Just Dad.

44:46.765 --> 44:49.205
Hey. I'd like to show you something.

44:49.765 --> 44:52.445
- Coming?
- Okay.

45:16.485 --> 45:17.725
Isn't it nice?

45:23.285 --> 45:26.525
You're so sexy when you're dancing.

45:51.565 --> 45:53.565
No, Aksel...

45:53.645 --> 45:55.765
Not now.

45:55.845 --> 45:58.485
What's wrong?

45:58.565 --> 46:02.925
Don't you think
the others are waiting for us?

46:03.005 --> 46:06.125
Why don't you just
tell me what's wrong?

46:06.205 --> 46:08.205
Nothing.

46:09.245 --> 46:11.325
I'm just saying we should go back.

46:31.445 --> 46:37.805
<i>I should have listened to you
and not to myself</i>

46:37.925 --> 46:44.285
<i>But if it's any comfort,
nothing is decided</i>

46:44.365 --> 46:50.725
<i>I know you feel I let you down when
all I tried to do was show the way</i>

46:50.805 --> 46:54.285
<i>But I think I read the signs all wrong</i>

46:55.925 --> 47:00.325
<i>So let me tell you that I'm sorry</i>

47:00.405 --> 47:03.045
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

47:03.125 --> 47:06.485
<i>Yes, it was only my fault</i>

47:06.565 --> 47:09.885
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

47:13.525 --> 47:16.525
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

47:20.005 --> 47:22.605
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

47:31.205 --> 47:34.165
- You came!
- Yes.

47:36.085 --> 47:40.005
Seriously... I'm sorry.

47:40.485 --> 47:44.765
I mean it. It was...
I was totally out of line.

47:44.845 --> 47:48.485
I should have thought twice about it.

47:48.565 --> 47:50.805
I hope it will be okay?

47:54.725 --> 47:57.725
- Josef.
- Amalie.

47:57.805 --> 48:00.805
- You thought life was wonderful?
- I knew it!

48:00.925 --> 48:03.325
It's not always wonderful.

48:03.405 --> 48:07.005
Okay. Sorry about that as well.

48:07.085 --> 48:09.005
I'm sorry about everything.

48:12.285 --> 48:13.565
Cool?

48:14.405 --> 48:15.405
It's all right.

48:23.205 --> 48:28.045
Want to train with us?
It's so much fun! You have to join us.

48:28.125 --> 48:30.685
Honestly... You're wrong.

48:30.765 --> 48:34.085
Dance is supposed to be fun. Come on.

48:34.165 --> 48:35.885
Then just watch.

48:37.445 --> 48:38.445
Okay.

49:50.685 --> 49:52.925
Cool.

51:30.565 --> 51:33.565
Impressive. I'm really impressed.

51:33.645 --> 51:37.085
That was so good! Shit...

51:37.165 --> 51:41.885
- Nice earrings.
- Would you like to have them?

51:41.965 --> 51:45.085
- Seriously?
- Sure. I've got a lot.

51:45.165 --> 51:48.725
- Shit, you're cool.
- Playing it nice.

51:48.805 --> 51:51.085
- See you.
- Yup.

51:52.485 --> 51:55.085
Seriously...

51:55.165 --> 51:58.205
You're awesome. That was intense.

51:59.245 --> 52:00.565
You are awesome.

52:02.965 --> 52:03.965
Thanks.

52:08.005 --> 52:10.405
If you think that...

52:10.485 --> 52:13.685
We give and take equally much...

52:15.445 --> 52:17.365
Sorry, I'm just fucking with you.

53:31.845 --> 53:34.125
That's it.

53:35.365 --> 53:37.365
Yes.

53:47.485 --> 53:50.285
Complete movements, Charlotte.

53:55.765 --> 53:59.725
No, no... Stop!

53:59.805 --> 54:03.845
I simply can't stand looking at this.
No, no, no.

54:04.565 --> 54:09.125
I find it embarrassing
that you dance like mechanical dolls.

54:10.285 --> 54:11.125
Well...

54:11.205 --> 54:16.005
Only one of you
is close to communicating something.

54:16.085 --> 54:17.645
Come on. Show them.

54:19.925 --> 54:23.445
No, not you. Amalie, come.

54:24.525 --> 54:26.125
Come, Amalie.

54:28.165 --> 54:29.165
So.

54:32.165 --> 54:33.005
And...

54:33.085 --> 54:35.085
Good.

54:35.165 --> 54:37.125
She is telling us something.

54:41.165 --> 54:44.365
Easy now. Accentuate the movement.

54:47.525 --> 54:52.285
Thank you. Excellent, Amalie.

54:52.365 --> 54:54.605
That's how it's done.

54:57.805 --> 55:03.005
Are those slightly bohemian
or is it just me?

55:03.085 --> 55:07.325
I just thought... I feel
they amplify the movements in modern.

55:07.405 --> 55:11.085
There are so many new things
about you these days.

55:11.805 --> 55:16.365
- You have a private teacher. Right?
- No.

55:16.445 --> 55:23.005
Or is there something else? You never
hang out with us anymore, and...

55:23.925 --> 55:28.165
- What is this?
- You don't want to party with us either.

55:28.245 --> 55:31.245
- No, Charlotte.
- Yes, I do.

55:31.325 --> 55:34.325
But if there won't be a party, tell us.

55:34.405 --> 55:37.285
Aren't we going to have a party?

55:37.365 --> 55:40.525
We'll have a party.
And I don't have a private teacher.

55:40.605 --> 55:44.085
Fine. Whatever you say.

55:44.165 --> 55:47.925
- Why do you go on like that, Charlotte?
- Well, I have to ask.

55:48.005 --> 55:53.565
- You can talk to me about things.
- It's nothing! Just forget it!

56:09.045 --> 56:12.045
- I'd like to show you something.
- Okay.

56:12.125 --> 56:15.485
- It's close by.
- Okay.

56:38.325 --> 56:40.005
It's so nice here.

56:41.685 --> 56:43.485
In Groruddalen?

56:46.925 --> 56:48.765
In Groruddalen.

57:26.725 --> 57:30.405
I sucked so much today.
How long until the audition?

57:30.525 --> 57:34.045
- Two weeks.
- Oh, my God. I have to practice.

57:34.165 --> 57:37.605
- Could we train at your place today?
- Of course.

57:37.685 --> 57:39.445
Thanks.

57:46.405 --> 57:50.125
Hi! We're off for a ride today.

57:50.205 --> 57:53.605
Aksel. What are you doing here?
I can’t today.

57:53.685 --> 57:56.685
- Why not?
- I have to practice.

57:56.765 --> 58:00.205
Then I'll just give you a ride.

58:00.285 --> 58:03.445
It's not like
we have to be together all the time!

58:03.525 --> 58:06.685
- But we're never together.
- What the hell?

58:06.765 --> 58:11.005
You seem to think
I have a duty to report to you!

58:11.365 --> 58:15.445
I'll take the underground.
It's faster anyway.

58:35.405 --> 58:40.565
AKSEL... WE HAVE TO TALK.

59:47.005 --> 59:49.365
No! What's that?

59:49.445 --> 59:51.965
Once more. Back again.

59:52.805 --> 59:55.925
Ready...

59:56.845 --> 59:59.045
And go.

01:00:00.245 --> 01:00:03.725
That's it. Yes.

01:00:03.805 --> 01:00:07.165
Good, Amalie. Great.

01:00:07.245 --> 01:00:10.165
Yes. There you go.

01:00:10.645 --> 01:00:12.245
And...

01:00:12.325 --> 01:00:17.325
- No, that's enough. Go to the back.
- I know it, I was just unfocused.

01:00:17.445 --> 01:00:20.725
You act like a baby now.
Didn't you hear me?

01:00:20.805 --> 01:00:22.925
Charlotte, go to the back.

01:00:25.765 --> 01:00:27.485
- Please...
- Now!

01:00:31.165 --> 01:00:33.765
Now! Go.

01:00:37.885 --> 01:00:38.885
Oh, dear.

01:00:40.005 --> 01:00:42.405
Drama queen.

01:00:47.125 --> 01:00:50.405
- Charlotte, are you okay?
- I'm great.

01:00:52.045 --> 01:00:55.685
And you're doing fabulously.

01:00:57.045 --> 01:01:01.445
- Who is Mikael?
- Did you take her phone?

01:01:01.525 --> 01:01:03.085
Have you lost it completely?

01:01:03.165 --> 01:01:06.365
Who is Mikael, Amalie?
Is he your coach?

01:01:08.645 --> 01:01:10.845
No.

01:01:10.965 --> 01:01:15.165
But what matters is you can't cope
with anyone being better than you.

01:01:15.245 --> 01:01:18.525
I shared. I let you train at my place.

01:01:18.605 --> 01:01:22.605
You don't share shit!
All you share is bad vibes!

01:01:22.685 --> 01:01:27.045
I can't believe you took her phone.
You can't do that!

01:01:27.125 --> 01:01:29.125
No, that's not okay.

01:01:29.205 --> 01:01:33.445
See? Bad vibes.

01:01:34.285 --> 01:01:36.285
Shit...

01:01:42.285 --> 01:01:46.485
- Drama queen.
- The first time Birgitta's been right.

01:01:56.525 --> 01:01:59.125
There's a battle at the end of the month.

01:02:00.645 --> 01:02:03.205
This time, I thought I would ask you.

01:02:05.845 --> 01:02:07.725
Would you like to dance with me?

01:02:11.645 --> 01:02:12.925
Yes, I would.

01:02:13.805 --> 01:02:14.965
Awesome.

01:02:16.045 --> 01:02:20.325
- Break?
- There's a first time for everything.

01:02:20.405 --> 01:02:21.605
You'll be amazing.

01:02:22.845 --> 01:02:27.965
We just have to fill it in, like this.
Then you have to press it.

01:02:36.245 --> 01:02:43.245
Shit. The first time I saw you...
It was just like...

01:02:46.365 --> 01:02:48.645
Oh, my God!

01:02:50.085 --> 01:02:53.085
And now...

01:03:02.045 --> 01:03:03.965
Oh, fuck.

01:03:08.805 --> 01:03:09.845
CALL REJECTED

01:03:20.605 --> 01:03:23.245
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
I'M AT YOUR DOOR...

01:03:27.725 --> 01:03:30.805
- I have to go.
- You have to go?

01:03:34.685 --> 01:03:40.685
- I forgot an appointment with Dad.
- Oh, no, don't go...

01:03:40.765 --> 01:03:44.205
- Mikael...
- Stay. Seriously.

01:03:44.285 --> 01:03:48.165
Hi, Aksel. I can explain.

01:03:48.245 --> 01:03:51.485
No, it's just temporary.

01:03:51.565 --> 01:03:54.845
In a hotel? Which one?

01:03:57.365 --> 01:04:02.205
Aksel, I don't want to talk about it.
Can't we just forget it?

01:04:02.285 --> 01:04:04.525
Right. What have you told the others?

01:04:06.965 --> 01:04:09.565
I haven't told them.

01:04:16.325 --> 01:04:19.485
And what are you planning to do
about the summer party?

01:04:25.365 --> 01:04:27.565
Can't we have it at your place?

01:04:36.325 --> 01:04:37.325
Yes...

01:04:39.325 --> 01:04:44.765
- Of course we can.
- I promise to fix everything.

01:04:53.765 --> 01:04:57.645
But, damn it, you have to start
being honest with me, Amalie.

01:04:59.405 --> 01:05:01.365
From now on, I demand...

01:05:03.445 --> 01:05:07.125
that you show me you feel the same way.

01:05:15.845 --> 01:05:17.045
Come here.

01:05:26.325 --> 01:05:31.165
MIKAEL: WANT TO DANCE
WITH ME TODAY?

01:05:37.285 --> 01:05:40.485
Thanks for paying.
I'll transfer it to you right away.

01:05:40.565 --> 01:05:43.965
No stress.
My God, I'm so sick of Birgitta's style.

01:05:44.045 --> 01:05:47.765
The way she treats Vanessa...
I would feel really hurt.

01:05:47.845 --> 01:05:52.725
I would die if someone
made those comments about me.

01:05:56.645 --> 01:05:58.645
Let's go in here!

01:05:58.725 --> 01:06:00.645
- Here?
- Yes.

01:06:00.725 --> 01:06:04.045
- Nille?
- They've got lots of decoration stuff.

01:06:04.125 --> 01:06:06.125
Okay.

01:06:06.205 --> 01:06:11.365
- Like these lights.
- Light strands? That's out, right?

01:06:11.445 --> 01:06:17.125
Isn't that so 2008 or something? It might
have been good for last year's party.

01:06:17.205 --> 01:06:19.845
I don't think that would fit in.

01:06:19.925 --> 01:06:22.965
But how about some tealights?

01:06:23.885 --> 01:06:27.605
Amalie? These?
Or maybe colored ones?

01:06:27.685 --> 01:06:29.685
- Nille lights?
- They're best in test.

01:06:29.765 --> 01:06:33.805
They burn an incredibly long time.
One light burns for 6 hours.

01:06:33.925 --> 01:06:39.725
But they come in colors as well. Or do
we stick to white? That’s classier.

01:06:39.805 --> 01:06:42.245
We'll be both indoors and outdoors.

01:06:42.405 --> 01:06:45.525
How about colors outdoors
and white indoors?

01:06:45.605 --> 01:06:49.005
- Hi! What's up?
- Hi.

01:06:49.085 --> 01:06:52.525
- Sorry, I'm just fucking with you.
- Hello.

01:06:52.605 --> 01:06:56.805
- Everything okay?
- We're kind of in a hurry.

01:06:56.925 --> 01:07:00.045
- We're on our way out.
- Have to buy this first.

01:07:00.125 --> 01:07:03.365
No, let's do it some other day.
Come on, Ida.

01:07:03.445 --> 01:07:07.045
- But I'll see you afterwards, right?
- Eh... Yes.

01:07:07.125 --> 01:07:11.285
- We'll text each other?
- Yes, I'll send you a message.

01:07:11.365 --> 01:07:13.765
- Come.
- Let's do it now.

01:07:13.845 --> 01:07:16.925
No, we have to go.

01:07:17.005 --> 01:07:20.325
Who were they? Do you know them?

01:07:20.405 --> 01:07:25.045
- They clean our house.
- You let them clean your house?

01:07:26.805 --> 01:07:29.645
What was her problem?

01:07:29.725 --> 01:07:34.725
- She ignored you. Just left.
- You know nothing.

01:07:34.805 --> 01:07:36.685
- Want candles?
- Candles?

01:07:51.765 --> 01:07:57.565
AMALIE: CAN'T THIS WEEK.
MY PERIOD.

01:07:58.285 --> 01:08:02.765
Come on. Lightly.
Has anyone seen Charlotte?

01:08:02.845 --> 01:08:06.805
- Amalie, have you seen Charlotte?
- No.

01:08:06.925 --> 01:08:09.205
Okay. One more time.

01:08:09.285 --> 01:08:11.445
Looking good today.

01:08:11.525 --> 01:08:15.765
Aksel. Come here.
A question about the party.

01:08:15.845 --> 01:08:18.925
Will the sea side or the garden side
be the main area?

01:08:19.005 --> 01:08:20.085
DANCE WITH ME

01:08:20.165 --> 01:08:21.765
Probably the garden side.

01:08:24.325 --> 01:08:26.725
Amalie?

01:08:27.085 --> 01:08:30.085
I think you should
apologize to Charlotte.

01:08:30.645 --> 01:08:34.085
You could have told her
that you have a coach on the side.

01:08:34.165 --> 01:08:38.165
I don't! He's a cleaner. You met him.

01:08:38.245 --> 01:08:40.885
Yes, but like... You see that it's wrong.

01:08:40.965 --> 01:08:44.484
- She's been a bitch for a long time.
- There's a reason why she's not here.

01:08:44.564 --> 01:08:48.484
- She was hurt by what you said.
- Can't anyone accept that I'm good?

01:08:53.524 --> 01:08:54.524
Hi.

01:08:57.365 --> 01:08:58.925
WHEN?

01:09:19.165 --> 01:09:23.965
Maybe some document
to make it look a bit better?

01:09:32.045 --> 01:09:33.285
Hi.

01:09:34.965 --> 01:09:36.404
Going to a party?

01:09:41.125 --> 01:09:43.125
What's up?

01:09:44.524 --> 01:09:47.524
Sorry I didn't answer your last message.

01:09:47.604 --> 01:09:49.365
My last messages.

01:09:52.005 --> 01:09:58.605
It's all right. Everyone has a lot to do.
I've also been busy. Probably you, too.

01:10:00.845 --> 01:10:03.005
I have to go.

01:10:05.765 --> 01:10:10.405
- You have to go?
- Yes, I'm in a hurry.

01:10:10.525 --> 01:10:13.565
- You know, it was only a game.
- What?

01:10:13.645 --> 01:10:15.645
You and me. This.

01:10:16.725 --> 01:10:20.725
Seriously?
It would never have worked out.

01:10:23.445 --> 01:10:26.485
No. I guess not.

01:10:38.485 --> 01:10:40.485
Fuck...

01:10:48.925 --> 01:10:51.245
Hi!

01:11:01.525 --> 01:11:04.005
Come, Amalie. Boasting.

01:11:34.045 --> 01:11:38.885
Is that what this is about? That I have
another name for the same color?

01:11:38.965 --> 01:11:43.085
- Aksel, I need to talk to you.
- I'll just wrap this up.

01:11:43.165 --> 01:11:47.885
You can see it one way,
and I see it another way.

01:11:47.965 --> 01:11:50.165
- I need to talk to you.
- Okay...

01:11:50.245 --> 01:11:53.205
Where's Amalie? I want to talk to her.

01:11:53.285 --> 01:11:55.685
I'll just take care of this.

01:11:58.245 --> 01:12:03.485
- Where is Amalie?
- Charlotte, take it easy. Calm down.

01:12:03.565 --> 01:12:09.005
I let you train in my house.
I've always been there for you.

01:12:09.085 --> 01:12:11.845
And then you steal
the Netherlands away from me!

01:12:13.485 --> 01:12:17.645
You've got fucking everything. And
then you take this away from me, too!

01:12:19.965 --> 01:12:21.685
I'm sorry.

01:12:21.765 --> 01:12:25.685
"Sorry"? Yes, because...

01:12:25.765 --> 01:12:30.565
That will of course
save my presentation. "Sorry"...

01:12:31.725 --> 01:12:34.565
- Sorry?! Damn whore!
- Hey!

01:12:34.645 --> 01:12:38.085
- Get out!
- Don't touch me. I can leave on my own!

01:12:38.165 --> 01:12:41.205
Then leave on your own!

01:12:41.285 --> 01:12:43.885
Hey... I'm sorry.

01:12:45.005 --> 01:12:47.365
Someone should help her.

01:12:47.445 --> 01:12:49.805
Amalie?

01:12:50.605 --> 01:12:52.765
Who's he?

01:12:52.845 --> 01:12:56.085
Mikael? How did you know I was here?

01:12:56.165 --> 01:13:00.885
What do you think?
You're tagged everywhere.

01:13:01.525 --> 01:13:04.445
Amalie? Who is this?

01:13:04.525 --> 01:13:05.885
That's her cleaner.

01:13:11.405 --> 01:13:13.525
He doesn't know about me, does he?

01:13:15.485 --> 01:13:16.525
Amalie?

01:13:16.605 --> 01:13:19.405
That you've got a guy from Ellingsrud
on the side?

01:13:22.965 --> 01:13:26.205
- I'm a joke, right?
- What the hell is this?

01:13:26.285 --> 01:13:31.645
We've been together, okay?
She and I. We hooked up.

01:13:36.405 --> 01:13:41.485
All the dancing... You just used me.

01:13:46.485 --> 01:13:48.765
Shit...

01:13:50.725 --> 01:13:53.605
I'm just a dancer.
With none of this fancy stuff.

01:13:53.685 --> 01:13:55.685
But at least I know who I am.

01:13:57.845 --> 01:14:00.085
- Mikael...
- No. Stay away from me.

01:14:00.165 --> 01:14:04.365
Bro, stay far away from her
because she'll break your heart.

01:14:18.085 --> 01:14:20.365
Aksel. Please...

01:14:21.405 --> 01:14:26.405
- No. Go get your things.
- Listen to me. Please.

01:14:26.525 --> 01:14:28.245
Go get your things!

01:14:54.645 --> 01:14:56.805
Put on some music.

01:14:56.925 --> 01:15:00.045
Music, dammit!

01:15:47.365 --> 01:15:53.365
<i>Welcome to Mikael's phone. I'm busy
now. Leave a message after the beep.</i>

01:15:53.445 --> 01:15:55.725
<i>Mikael.</i>

01:15:55.805 --> 01:16:02.045
I'm sorry. I've been so incredibly fucked.

01:16:02.125 --> 01:16:05.925
<i>Please pick up the phone.</i>

01:16:06.005 --> 01:16:08.445
WHAT IS YOUR SITUATION?
LOOKING FOR WORK OR BEING LAID OFF?

01:16:08.845 --> 01:16:09.965
ARE YOU LOOKING FOR WORK?

01:16:22.045 --> 01:16:25.565
CATEGORY
ALL STYLES 1 VS 1

01:17:12.205 --> 01:17:13.845
That's all for today.

01:17:15.285 --> 01:17:17.365
It's the worst thing I've ever seen.

01:17:20.245 --> 01:17:22.765
Amalie, could you stay for a minute?

01:17:27.205 --> 01:17:30.285
- What's happening?
- Nothing.

01:17:30.365 --> 01:17:35.205
Okay. Show me the last part
of the choreography for the audition.

01:17:51.365 --> 01:17:52.965
What the hell is going on?

01:17:53.925 --> 01:17:58.125
I've seen you develop from a mediocre
dancer to a very special one.

01:18:00.005 --> 01:18:03.525
Hello! Where did you go?

01:18:04.405 --> 01:18:08.325
Are you serious? Haven't you picked up
anything that happened lately?

01:18:08.405 --> 01:18:13.725
- Then use it, dammit.
- Use it? Everybody hates me!

01:18:13.805 --> 01:18:16.885
Good. Then you've got
something to communicate.

01:18:19.725 --> 01:18:22.725
Use it, for fuck's sake.
See you at the audition.

01:19:12.725 --> 01:19:15.405
Thank you, Ida.

01:19:18.925 --> 01:19:22.885
Vanessa. Come up here.

01:19:26.565 --> 01:19:28.965
Are you ready?

01:19:40.525 --> 01:19:43.125
Thank you.

01:19:48.245 --> 01:19:52.765
It's Charlotte's turn. Come.

01:20:34.805 --> 01:20:38.725
- Yeah, I have seen enough.
- Thank you.

01:20:38.805 --> 01:20:41.085
Thank you, Charlotte.

01:20:44.805 --> 01:20:46.685
Amalie?

01:21:37.285 --> 01:21:38.525
Hello...?

01:21:41.725 --> 01:21:44.605
Don't you feel well, Amalie?

01:21:46.925 --> 01:21:48.565
Would you like some water?

01:21:50.285 --> 01:21:54.405
Okay. Let's do it from the top.

01:21:54.485 --> 01:21:55.485
No.

01:21:57.085 --> 01:21:59.925
- No?
- No.

01:22:00.005 --> 01:22:03.965
What do you mean?

01:22:04.045 --> 01:22:06.685
This is not me.

01:22:07.565 --> 01:22:13.445
All this hasn't got shit to do with me.

01:22:13.565 --> 01:22:17.925
I don't belong here.
That place isn't mine.

01:22:18.005 --> 01:22:21.605
I'm meant for something else.

01:23:05.005 --> 01:23:07.085
Hi, Ida.

01:25:42.085 --> 01:25:43.325
<i>Mikael!</i>

01:25:54.325 --> 01:25:56.965
No! Seriously?

01:25:58.245 --> 01:26:01.005
Won't happen!
I'm not dancing against her.

01:26:01.085 --> 01:26:04.205
- Honestly, folks.
- Just do it.

01:26:07.725 --> 01:26:10.165
- Just get it over with.
- Use it!

01:26:13.045 --> 01:26:16.525
- Did you listen to your voicemail?
- No.

01:26:16.605 --> 01:26:22.165
- Won't you please listen to me?
- I'll crush you, okay?

01:26:22.245 --> 01:26:25.805
I listened to you when you
made a fool of me in front of everyone.

01:26:25.885 --> 01:26:27.805
That's different.

01:27:25.245 --> 01:27:27.125
Amalie!

01:27:28.085 --> 01:27:29.645
You love him!

- Eh?
- You have to show him!

01:27:38.525 --> 01:27:41.405
From your heart. Come on!

01:27:44.765 --> 01:27:48.205
Okay!

01:31:08.165 --> 01:31:11.925
- One round and you're done.
- Finish what you started, man!

01:31:24.405 --> 01:31:29.965
It was no game. I know it's hard

01:31:30.645 --> 01:31:32.805
I just want you to know that...

01:31:32.925 --> 01:31:36.725
if you give me another chance,
I promise I won't fuck up.
