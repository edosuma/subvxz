00:18.018 --> 00:20.147
<i>Previously on </i> Bad Blood.

00:20.230 --> 00:22.690
I know these people.
It's all about family.

00:22.773 --> 00:25.568
<i>I cheated on you and
I got caught by this detective.</i>

00:25.652 --> 00:28.613
<i>She told me if I didn't tell her stuff,
she would tell you.</i>

00:28.697 --> 00:31.073
Good work on getting
that recording to Domenic.

00:31.950 --> 00:33.743
This is where it starts.

00:33.827 --> 00:35.578
- Val?
<i>- What did you do?</i>

00:35.662 --> 00:38.080
I had no choice.
It had to be done, Enzo.

00:39.665 --> 00:40.875
I'll never forgive you.

00:40.958 --> 00:42.502
<i>She's gone and her car's gone.</i>

00:42.585 --> 00:44.212
Something must've happened.

00:44.295 --> 00:46.630
Send the cops! Send someone!

00:46.713 --> 00:49.193
<i>You're thinking,
"Well, if he's wiped out the Irish...</i>

00:49.217 --> 00:53.847
maybe he's coming for me next."
The answer to that question is no.

00:58.225 --> 01:01.312
Bastard! He cut it way too much.

01:01.395 --> 01:04.857
We want partners, not adversaries.

01:04.940 --> 01:09.320
For both of our businesses,
we want you to take care of Declan.

01:09.403 --> 01:10.447
Deal.

01:10.530 --> 01:13.407
This was at the church lab.
I think that's the same lighter.

01:13.492 --> 01:15.618
Call the RCMP liaison in Italy.

01:15.702 --> 01:18.287
They have passports.
Their fingerprints would be on file there.

01:18.370 --> 01:22.083
You don't think if Nats could reunite
with his son, he wouldn't sell you out?

01:22.167 --> 01:23.877
They know which side they're on.

01:23.960 --> 01:27.047
I spoke to Bobby. You now
own Nats's protection contract.

01:27.130 --> 01:29.882
- So whatever you got planned better work.
- It will.

01:29.965 --> 01:33.177
- This is private property.
- I just wanna talk.

01:33.260 --> 01:37.057
One day soon,
a gift will be presented to you.

01:37.140 --> 01:39.808
It's gonna drop in your lap.
Don't question it.

01:39.892 --> 01:42.187
- Guess who came to dinner?
<i>- You got them?</i>

01:42.270 --> 01:43.312
Don't lose 'em.

01:54.865 --> 01:58.870
<i>I've got one shot to get rid
of the twins and get my city back.</i>

01:59.828 --> 02:02.665
<i>The dominoes are lined up just
waiting for me to knock 'em down.</i>

02:02.748 --> 02:06.710
<i>In 24 hours, either the rightful
order of things will be restored,</i>

02:06.793 --> 02:09.213
<i>or I will be six feet under.</i>

02:09.297 --> 02:11.090
<i>I give it 50-50 odds.</i>

02:12.300 --> 02:14.427
That's it. That's where they are.

02:14.510 --> 02:17.930
I stayed up all night and hacked
all the info on this building.

02:18.013 --> 02:21.767
Teresa and Christian are
on the top floor, of course.

02:21.852 --> 02:25.563
They rented all the units on either side
of them and the one below.

02:25.647 --> 02:28.357
- Now, that's paranoia.
- How do I get in?

02:28.440 --> 02:30.360
The building's owned
by an Israeli family

02:30.443 --> 02:33.780
who started getting bomb threats,
so security's top-level.

02:33.863 --> 02:37.867
One gated garage entrance.
High security at the front.

02:37.950 --> 02:41.037
Fingerprint scanners in the elevators.

02:41.120 --> 02:44.415
<i>We uncovered a large-scale
fentanyl production lab.</i>

02:44.498 --> 02:47.502
<i>The perpetrators set up
their labs inside this church,</i>

02:47.585 --> 02:50.087
<i>right in the middle
of a residential area.</i>

02:50.170 --> 02:53.132
Relax.
We will be going home soon.

02:53.215 --> 02:56.010
- We need to get rid of him.
- Just relax.

02:57.678 --> 03:00.432
We make a deal with the Irish,
he kills him!

03:00.515 --> 03:02.600
He's laughing at us!

03:02.683 --> 03:04.893
And you know it was Declan
who found the church.

03:04.977 --> 03:09.857
<i>This operation could produce $200 million
worth of fentanyl in one year alone.</i>

03:09.940 --> 03:13.987
We should've killed him
the first time we met, like I wanted.

03:14.070 --> 03:15.572
<i>When we know more,
we'll let you know.</i>

03:15.655 --> 03:17.365
Maybe you are right.

03:17.448 --> 03:20.285
You know, who does this,
leaves a baby alone?

03:20.368 --> 03:22.971
Does she have any issues
with mental illness? Is she depressed?

03:22.995 --> 03:25.332
Oh yeah, she's depressed.

03:25.415 --> 03:28.000
Her husband's in jail.

03:28.083 --> 03:31.503
I tried to help her but, you know,
she's not right in her mind these days.

03:31.587 --> 03:33.422
You should've seen her at the party.

03:33.505 --> 03:37.468
Drunk and out of her mind
on her own son's first birthday.

03:37.552 --> 03:41.555
Listen to me, I left her last night.
She was drunk and passed out in bed.

03:41.638 --> 03:43.933
Today, she's gone, car's gone.

03:44.017 --> 03:47.062
If you ask me, I don't think
she can handle things on her own.

03:47.145 --> 03:49.605
I mean, my son used to
do everything for her.

03:49.688 --> 03:51.398
I just think it's too much for her.

03:51.482 --> 03:54.985
Now, this kid needs something to eat!

03:55.068 --> 03:58.823
And then I gotta bring you to daycare.

03:58.907 --> 04:00.992
<i>Leave a message.
I'll get right back to you.</i>

04:01.075 --> 04:03.953
Hey, call your father, Luca.

04:25.808 --> 04:28.812
<i>Look, I need a clear
line of sight on the twins.</i>

04:28.895 --> 04:31.063
How about getting into this building?

04:31.147 --> 04:33.273
I could get a couple of
clean shots off from the roof.

04:33.357 --> 04:35.233
No, the windows are all bullet-proofed.

04:37.403 --> 04:40.280
- One garage door, that's it?
- Yeah.

04:42.617 --> 04:44.285
I don't need to get in.

04:44.368 --> 04:46.997
I just need them to get out.

04:51.750 --> 04:52.750
Hey.

04:52.793 --> 04:54.212
I know where they are.

04:54.295 --> 04:57.382
- OK, what's next?
- <i>I got a plan.</i>

04:57.465 --> 05:00.008
There's gonna be a lot of
moving parts, contingencies.

05:00.092 --> 05:03.428
<i>I need something from you, Rose.
I need two of your guys that you trust,</i>

05:03.512 --> 05:07.267
that you know can handle themselves.
I need them in Toronto tomorrow early.

05:07.350 --> 05:11.770
I got one shot at this. If I miss,
then they're gonna send an army at me.

05:12.647 --> 05:15.190
- I'm coming.
<i>- No, you're not. It's too dangerous.</i>

05:15.273 --> 05:18.193
- I can handle it.
<i>- I know you can. That's not it.</i>

05:18.277 --> 05:20.697
I don't want you around
if things go wrong.

05:20.780 --> 05:23.073
I'll send you the coordinates. Bye!

05:30.247 --> 05:32.083
Bobby, we're a go.

05:32.167 --> 05:34.835
<i>Execute the plan as discussed.</i>

06:02.988 --> 06:04.907
What's up, Bobby?

06:06.658 --> 06:08.953
You're a good guy, Nats.

06:09.037 --> 06:10.705
Sorry about this.

06:12.915 --> 06:14.375
Whoo! Fight!

07:05.092 --> 07:08.428
Oh man, this is the best
eggs Benedict I've ever had!

07:08.512 --> 07:11.182
- Yeah?
- Oh, yeah! I mean, not even close.

07:11.265 --> 07:13.558
This guy is never leaving.
Seriously, you gotta try this.

07:13.642 --> 07:16.270
- Are you ready to go?
- You gotta try this first.

07:17.563 --> 07:19.523
- Twix...
- Just try it!

07:24.903 --> 07:26.780
OK, let's go.

07:26.863 --> 07:28.867
I'm gonna go get my jacket.

07:31.243 --> 07:33.830
This is really good.
You have a knack for it.

07:33.913 --> 07:35.832
Thank you.

07:35.915 --> 07:38.708
Where's Declan?
Everything's alright?

07:38.792 --> 07:40.753
Yeah, he's fine.
He'll be home soon.

08:04.193 --> 08:05.402
What?

08:15.453 --> 08:19.333
A missing person's report was filed
by Enzo Cosoleto for Valentina.

08:28.008 --> 08:30.970
Yeah, he said
he went by to visit,

08:31.053 --> 08:33.429
she wasn't there,
and the baby was alone.

08:34.640 --> 08:36.683
Her car is missing too.

08:43.982 --> 08:46.693
Ms. Falcone, of course
I wanna do everything I can

08:46.777 --> 08:48.320
to make your wedding day perfect.

08:48.403 --> 08:51.532
But I told you already,
we can't make 300 pastries

08:51.615 --> 08:53.200
to look like your dog!

08:53.283 --> 08:55.828
I understand you feel
he's part of your family,

08:55.912 --> 08:57.830
but we don't do that!

08:57.913 --> 09:00.498
Fine, so cancel!

09:00.583 --> 09:03.877
But you don't get back your deposit.
And let me tell you another thing,

09:03.962 --> 09:08.173
you and your husband are crazy.
It's a dog! It licks its own balls!

09:09.675 --> 09:10.885
Yeah?

09:10.968 --> 09:13.428
<i>- Lorenzo Cosoleto, please.</i>
- That's me.

09:13.512 --> 09:16.848
<i>I'm the warden at the remand centre
your son Ignazio's being held at.</i>

09:16.932 --> 09:19.977
<i>- There's been an incident.</i>
- What happened?

09:20.060 --> 09:22.228
<i>He's in the infirmary
in intensive care.</i>

09:22.313 --> 09:25.315
- Oh, my God! What happened?
- <i>He was assaulted. </i> He's alive.

09:25.398 --> 09:28.777
<i>The doctor's seen him, but he may
have to be moved to a city hospital.</i>

09:28.860 --> 09:31.905
- How did this happen? Who did it?
<i>- We're investigating right now.</i>

09:31.988 --> 09:34.908
<i>He was found this morning. Somehow,
they got into his cell last night.</i>

09:34.992 --> 09:37.328
I'm coming there now!

09:39.330 --> 09:40.538
Hi, Enzo!

09:41.498 --> 09:43.792
I don't have time for this shit.
My son's been hurt!

09:43.875 --> 09:45.837
- Get back inside.
- Oh, goddammit!

09:45.920 --> 09:48.505
Back inside. Keep going.

09:51.175 --> 09:54.095
- Enzo, you're gonna want to sit.
- I don't wanna sit! Did you hear me?

09:54.178 --> 09:56.680
- He's gone to the city hospital!
- I know he has.

09:56.763 --> 09:59.350
- I put him there.
- You son of a...!

09:59.433 --> 10:02.143
Hey, hey, hey! No, no!
No, no, no!

10:03.687 --> 10:06.857
You're worried about your boy.
That's understandable.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.985
- He's OK right now.
- No, he's not OK!

10:09.068 --> 10:12.822
Calm down! Enzo, listen to me,
and things will be alright.

10:12.905 --> 10:14.698
What do you want?

10:14.782 --> 10:18.285
I now own the protection
contract on Nats.

10:18.368 --> 10:21.247
- Bobby doesn't break contracts!
- He did this time.

10:21.330 --> 10:23.123
Look at that.

10:26.460 --> 10:28.003
Look at your boy.

10:31.507 --> 10:35.427
Personally, I think
Bobby went a little overboard

10:35.510 --> 10:38.805
from what I asked him to do,
but it's hard to oversee these things.

10:38.888 --> 10:41.017
You know what guys are like inside.

10:42.100 --> 10:44.395
I own Nats's life, Enzo,

10:44.478 --> 10:46.480
for as long as he's in that place,

10:46.563 --> 10:49.358
and you and I both know that could be
years and years and years.

10:51.277 --> 10:54.238
- And you come here to tell me that?
- I came to talk to you,

10:54.322 --> 10:57.825
cos I believe you're the last
clearly-thinking man of your family.

10:57.908 --> 11:00.243
I'm gonna ask you
to do something.

11:00.327 --> 11:03.955
But before I do, I want you
to keep this in mind.

11:04.040 --> 11:08.168
The beating that Nats took today
was to get you to listen.

11:08.252 --> 11:10.212
And if you don't do
what I'm about to say,

11:10.295 --> 11:14.217
for the next year, every day,
day in and day out,

11:14.300 --> 11:16.593
your boy's gonna get beat to a pulp,

11:16.677 --> 11:19.222
to a pulp, until he begs to die.

11:21.432 --> 11:23.892
It's all gonna be over soon, Enzo.

11:25.143 --> 11:29.565
You just play along, and I promise you...
Listen to me, I promise you,

11:29.648 --> 11:33.818
Nats will be safe and protected
every single day he's in prison.

11:33.902 --> 11:35.695
Come on.

11:35.780 --> 11:37.823
Just get to it already.

11:38.948 --> 11:40.533
What do you want, Declan?

11:40.617 --> 11:42.160
You're gonna turn crown witness.

11:42.243 --> 11:45.122
You're gonna walk right into
the RCMP and tell them everything.

11:45.205 --> 11:47.875
You'll have to give up your family.
There's no getting around that.

11:47.958 --> 11:51.670
But mostly, you're gonna
turn on Teresa and Christian.

11:51.753 --> 11:54.507
You have no choice, Enzo.
Don't fight it.

12:02.807 --> 12:04.475
But if you say no,

12:04.558 --> 12:06.703
as soon as I walk out that door,
I'm getting on the phone,

12:06.727 --> 12:10.105
and maybe Nats loses
an ear or an eye.

12:11.440 --> 12:14.402
Certainly something he's got two of.

12:18.363 --> 12:21.617
Fine, just call your people off.

12:24.703 --> 12:26.080
OK.

12:28.540 --> 12:32.127
But I'll leave Luca out of it. He walks.

12:32.210 --> 12:34.880
OK. That's fine.

12:38.592 --> 12:40.010
Pull out your phone.

12:40.093 --> 12:41.678
- Why?
- Pull out your phone.

12:41.762 --> 12:44.013
- Why?
- Just pull it out. Pull out your phone.

12:44.097 --> 12:45.682
Get it out.

12:45.765 --> 12:48.018
Open a text to your brother,
and give it to me.

12:50.938 --> 12:52.815
Is that what you think?
I'm not gonna kill him.

12:52.898 --> 12:56.818
I give you my word, I swear.
I just want him here.

12:56.902 --> 12:59.363
I want him to know
what's about to happen.

12:59.447 --> 13:02.157
I want it to come from you.

13:02.240 --> 13:04.535
It's over now, Enzo,

13:04.618 --> 13:07.497
and I want you to have the opportunity

13:07.580 --> 13:11.000
to say goodbye to your brother
face-to-face. You deserve that.

13:35.482 --> 13:37.483
He's on his way.

13:39.612 --> 13:41.447
You made the right decision.

13:41.530 --> 13:45.283
You know what, maybe you should've
been in charge this whole time, Enzo.

13:45.367 --> 13:48.047
I have a feeling we'd be in a different
place right now, you and me.

13:50.372 --> 13:51.873
I think you're right.

14:09.182 --> 14:11.352
Where are we going?

14:11.435 --> 14:13.603
We're gonna get the people
that killed Wes.

14:13.687 --> 14:16.607
We're gonna need a few more guns.

14:22.738 --> 14:25.532
Hey! What's going on?

14:26.742 --> 14:28.618
Enz, you alright?
Why did you call me?

14:31.955 --> 14:33.790
How you doing, Domenic?

14:33.873 --> 14:37.002
What is, uh... what is this?

14:37.085 --> 14:38.962
We got lots to talk about.

14:40.088 --> 14:43.342
What's to talk about, Declan? I told you
if we went to war, I was gonna be on you.

14:43.425 --> 14:47.012
And I told you to walk away.
So let's just agree to disagree, right?

14:47.095 --> 14:50.682
Alright, well, you're
the one with the gun, so talk.

14:51.850 --> 14:53.435
Enzo, tell him.

14:53.518 --> 14:55.938
Enzo, tell him, tell him what?

14:57.355 --> 15:00.608
Nats is hurt bad. They beat
the hell out of him inside.

15:00.692 --> 15:03.778
- Alright, what happened?
- Declan happened.

15:08.992 --> 15:10.953
What are you talking about?

15:11.037 --> 15:13.288
What are you talking about?
Nats is protected.

15:13.372 --> 15:16.333
- Not anymore.
- Listen, Bobby doesn't break protection.

15:16.417 --> 15:20.462
What did you do? You hired somebody
to go after his kid? Is that what you did?

15:20.545 --> 15:22.882
He owns the contract. He owns Nats.

15:22.965 --> 15:24.883
- It's over, Dom!
- Nothing is over.

15:24.967 --> 15:27.087
- He's already hurt him. He owns him!
- Shh, shh, shh!

15:27.135 --> 15:29.388
- He's won, Dom!
- Please stop.

15:29.472 --> 15:32.057
- The son of a bitch won!
- Listen to me, shut up!

15:32.140 --> 15:34.852
Alright, he's fine.
Nats is gonna be fine.

15:34.935 --> 15:38.688
Alright, he can handle it.
Trust me, he can handle it.

15:40.440 --> 15:41.983
Tell him already, Enzo.

15:44.737 --> 15:46.405
I'm turning witness.

15:48.032 --> 15:50.575
Dom, I gotta do it.

15:51.868 --> 15:54.913
I'm not gonna let my son
be tortured day in, day out inside.

15:54.997 --> 15:57.667
- I can't do it.
- No, stop it.

15:57.750 --> 16:01.337
I'll protect Luca.
I'll make sure he walks, I swear!

16:01.420 --> 16:04.673
I don't need you to protect my son, Enzo.
What are you doing right now?

16:04.757 --> 16:08.885
I can take care of the family. That's
what I do. I take care of the family.

16:08.968 --> 16:11.222
Like you took care of Val?

16:23.692 --> 16:25.985
It was you, wasn't it,
who sent me that tape?

16:26.070 --> 16:27.738
It was you.

16:27.822 --> 16:30.698
I don't know what
you're talking about.

16:30.782 --> 16:33.285
Dom, listen, listen, listen.

16:34.412 --> 16:37.205
This is our chance to save our boys.

16:38.207 --> 16:40.893
- We take the bullets, not them.
- I don't understand who you are right now.

16:40.917 --> 16:43.587
- I don't have it in me anymore.
- Shut your mouth!

16:43.670 --> 16:45.963
Don't you see what
you're doing here, Enzo?

16:46.048 --> 16:48.050
You're doing exactly what he wants.

16:48.133 --> 16:50.052
What do you think he's doing here?

16:50.135 --> 16:51.845
What do you think is
gonna happen next?

16:51.928 --> 16:55.098
You think I'm gonna kill you?
I'm not here to kill you.

16:55.182 --> 16:57.183
Walk away!

16:57.267 --> 17:00.478
You went all the way down
the line with those twins.

17:00.562 --> 17:04.442
You did. And if this is how
I get 'em, this is how I get 'em.

17:05.442 --> 17:06.693
Dom.

17:07.693 --> 17:08.903
Dom.

17:10.821 --> 17:12.950
I'll buy you time.

17:13.032 --> 17:16.078
Just walk out,
and get on a plane.

17:16.162 --> 17:18.538
Get on a plane?
What do you want me to do?

17:18.622 --> 17:21.958
You think I should hide in a cave
cos your idiot son can't take a beating?

17:22.041 --> 17:23.292
Enzo!

17:24.670 --> 17:26.547
Luca can start fresh.

17:26.630 --> 17:30.092
He's gonna take care of Adamo.
Let's make things right for them.

17:30.175 --> 17:31.677
Brother...

17:33.470 --> 17:34.847
I'm sorry.

17:36.098 --> 17:37.808
I'm sorry.

17:56.577 --> 17:59.162
You wanna ruin our family?

17:59.245 --> 18:01.498
Get this over with, Declan.

18:11.592 --> 18:13.635
Enzo, you comfortable?

18:13.718 --> 18:15.637
Is this really necessary?

18:15.720 --> 18:18.015
You guys run when all else fails.

18:18.098 --> 18:20.267
I'm too old to run.

18:20.350 --> 18:21.935
You got a smoke?

18:25.605 --> 18:28.442
A smoke? Alright.

18:30.068 --> 18:32.112
Get your mitt on that.

18:44.958 --> 18:46.918
Why'd you let my brother leave?

18:47.002 --> 18:50.005
You think Domenic's gonna skip town
by going to the airport? No.

18:50.088 --> 18:54.050
No, Enzo. He's gonna go
see Luca, take care of his son.

18:54.133 --> 18:56.428
You always take care
of the boys first, right?

18:56.512 --> 18:58.597
And then...

18:58.680 --> 19:00.973
Teresa and Christian.

19:01.057 --> 19:03.393
He's a loyal soldier,
that brother of yours.

19:03.477 --> 19:06.397
Why'd you give them a head start?
These people have private jets.

19:06.480 --> 19:10.650
You want them arrested, they'll just fly
off somewhere with no extradition laws.

19:14.028 --> 19:16.657
Oh, you don't really want
them arrested, do you?

19:19.535 --> 19:22.495
Listen, I hope you get them.

19:22.578 --> 19:26.040
When you do, shoot them
again for me, will ya?

19:33.965 --> 19:36.802
Luca, I don't got time for this.
Open the door right now.

19:39.178 --> 19:40.263
Luca!

19:48.855 --> 19:51.983
- What is the matter with you?
- I don't wanna talk to you right now.

19:52.067 --> 19:54.612
No, forget about that, alright?

19:54.695 --> 19:58.615
You're gonna have to pack
your things and go. Enzo's turning rat.

19:58.698 --> 20:00.783
You gotta get a bag.

20:00.867 --> 20:04.078
- What are you talking about?
- Declan, I guess he, uh...

20:05.247 --> 20:09.250
He got to Nats. He threatened him.
He had him beat up and...

20:09.333 --> 20:10.585
Nats?

20:10.668 --> 20:13.297
Says he's gonna kill him
if Enzo doesn't spill.

20:13.380 --> 20:17.342
- Is Nats OK?
- Is Nats OK? Yeah, he's OK.

20:17.425 --> 20:20.053
- So what happened to him?
- We don't got time for this!

20:21.388 --> 20:24.683
You gotta go, and you're gonna
pack a bag, alright?

20:24.767 --> 20:27.893
You get your passport. Then you go
to my house. You stop at my safe.

20:27.978 --> 20:29.980
You go in there, you take...
Listen to me!

20:30.063 --> 20:32.416
You take all the money that's in there.
Combination's your birthday.

20:32.440 --> 20:34.192
- Are you hearing me?
- Passport?

20:34.275 --> 20:36.528
Pop, I can't even think right now!

20:36.612 --> 20:38.113
What is going on?

20:38.197 --> 20:40.782
Well, Enzo says he's not gonna,
you know...

20:40.865 --> 20:44.285
bring you into this, but I can't
take any chances, Luca, alright?

20:44.368 --> 20:47.497
Who knows what those pineapples
are gonna do if they find out.

20:47.580 --> 20:49.308
You see, he's talking
cos of what you did to Val.

20:49.332 --> 20:51.208
- Everything that you did.
- Shut up!

20:51.293 --> 20:53.545
- You shut up! You shut up!
- Not now!

20:53.628 --> 20:55.088
Not now!

21:06.098 --> 21:08.768
You understand?
This is gonna go down fast.

21:08.852 --> 21:12.605
You go in there. You get the money.
You get the passports.

21:12.688 --> 21:16.108
You go the farm, wait for me there. I'm
gonna call you and tell you what to do.

21:17.193 --> 21:19.153
Where we gonna go?

21:20.113 --> 21:21.280
Where we gonna go?

21:24.325 --> 21:25.868
Listen, I'm sorry.

21:25.952 --> 21:27.703
Listen to me.

21:27.787 --> 21:30.207
You are the most important
thing in the world to me.

21:30.290 --> 21:31.542
Understand that?

21:31.625 --> 21:35.545
I'm never gonna let anything
happen to you, Luca, I swear.

21:35.628 --> 21:39.507
But right now, I need
you to listen, OK?

21:39.590 --> 21:41.217
And I need you to move.

21:41.300 --> 21:43.970
I'm gonna take care
of this, I promise.

21:44.053 --> 21:47.015
I'm gonna take care of this.

21:47.098 --> 21:49.350
I promise I'm gonna
take care of this.

21:50.602 --> 21:51.812
Promise.

22:16.837 --> 22:18.797
<i>Yeah?</i>

22:18.880 --> 22:20.715
Just like you said, Domenic's here.

22:20.798 --> 22:22.883
Perfect, sit tight.

22:22.967 --> 22:25.595
Things working out for you?

22:25.678 --> 22:30.725
Yeah, it's looking to be
a good day, Enzo, all around.

22:34.520 --> 22:36.607
Let's get one thing straight.

22:37.607 --> 22:39.192
I don't like it that I'm here.

22:40.568 --> 22:42.862
I don't like it that
I'm talking to you two.

22:42.945 --> 22:46.408
You two children are
the reason we're in this mess.

22:48.743 --> 22:50.162
And if it wasn't for your father,

22:50.245 --> 22:52.247
the two of you would've
been dead a long time ago.

22:58.212 --> 23:00.047
My brother's turning rat,

23:00.130 --> 23:02.798
and there's nothing
I can do to stop him.

23:02.882 --> 23:04.968
After Nats was assaulted in prison,

23:05.052 --> 23:07.887
Declan has the fear of God in Enzo

23:07.970 --> 23:10.640
that it's gonna continue, maybe worse.

23:10.723 --> 23:13.393
Who did you arrange
protection with?

23:13.477 --> 23:15.145
Bobby Sunwind.

23:15.228 --> 23:17.188
His people, they run
the protection on the inside.

23:18.273 --> 23:19.900
They never break protection,

23:19.983 --> 23:23.153
so I don't know what
Declan has on him, but...

23:25.113 --> 23:28.992
We both know that there's
only one way to fix this.

23:31.453 --> 23:34.372
And my brother
has made his decision,

23:34.455 --> 23:36.708
so he has to suffer
the consequences.

23:36.792 --> 23:38.668
And what about Nats?

23:38.752 --> 23:41.170
He's got nothing to do with it.

23:43.882 --> 23:46.927
He might think different
once his father is dead.

23:49.930 --> 23:52.515
Like father, like son.

23:56.812 --> 23:58.272
Where's Luca?

23:59.438 --> 24:01.148
I told him to lay low. He's fine.

24:02.358 --> 24:04.610
Enzo's not gonna
implicate him on anything.

24:04.693 --> 24:06.780
No, he's free.

24:06.863 --> 24:09.198
Nobody touches Luca.
You understand?

24:10.367 --> 24:13.453
Nobody touches Luca.
Do you understand?

24:16.163 --> 24:18.625
We will not touch Luca

24:18.708 --> 24:23.255
as long as you deal with
your brother and nephew.

24:28.302 --> 24:30.678
You know, with my brother
and Nats out of the picture,

24:30.762 --> 24:34.640
the cops won't have anything
on you and me or Luca.

24:42.940 --> 24:45.902
Right here, we're all that's left.

24:51.448 --> 24:53.702
I'll, uh...

24:53.785 --> 24:55.078
I'll talk to the bikers.

24:55.162 --> 24:57.306
They got people on the inside that...

25:03.085 --> 25:06.297
What are you...
We do not need this now!

25:06.380 --> 25:09.133
Teresa, me, I'm sick and tired
of these people, OK?

25:09.217 --> 25:11.720
It's always one problem
after another!

25:11.803 --> 25:14.263
You will clean this up!

25:16.182 --> 25:17.433
Oh!

25:34.910 --> 25:37.037
Give me your hands.

25:40.540 --> 25:43.293
Walk right in there.
Ask for Nellie Bullock.

25:43.377 --> 25:46.045
Yeah, I know who she is.

25:50.175 --> 25:52.427
You're doing the right thing, Enzo.

25:52.510 --> 25:54.470
You're taking care of your boy.

25:54.553 --> 25:58.267
I don't need a piece of shit like you
telling me what's right and what's wrong.

25:59.558 --> 26:03.397
You have no idea what it's like
to have a family like I do.

26:04.813 --> 26:07.900
My brother took care of me
my whole life.

26:09.987 --> 26:12.738
Now I'm throwing him down a hole.

26:15.992 --> 26:19.328
And I deserve to burn in hell for it.

26:47.940 --> 26:49.650
Let's talk.

26:55.823 --> 26:58.075
This way, Mr. Cosoleto.

27:09.712 --> 27:12.840
Take him down
the freight elevator and get rid of him.

27:12.923 --> 27:14.467
It's time we leave.

27:14.550 --> 27:16.720
And let Declan win?
Absolutely not.

27:16.803 --> 27:19.013
Once Enzo talks,
the police will come for us.

27:19.097 --> 27:21.366
- They don't even know where to find us.
- You don't know that!

27:21.390 --> 27:25.228
There's too much we don't know.
We must act on what we do know.

27:25.312 --> 27:28.607
So you want to hop on a plane
and leave things like this?

27:29.607 --> 27:33.027
Are you going to tell Papa
that we failed?

27:33.110 --> 27:34.695
Because I won't.

27:37.240 --> 27:39.450
OK, let's think.

27:39.533 --> 27:42.245
All this happened because, uh,

27:42.328 --> 27:45.082
Declan broke Ignazio's
protection contract.

27:45.165 --> 27:47.042
And you heard Domenic.

27:47.125 --> 27:49.835
They never break
protection contracts, so...

27:52.130 --> 27:54.798
how did Declan do this?

28:07.853 --> 28:08.980
Yeah?

28:09.063 --> 28:12.442
- Do you know Bobby Sunwind?
<i>- Yeah, he's in jail right now.</i>

28:13.652 --> 28:15.778
Is there a connection
between him and Declan?

28:15.862 --> 28:18.155
- I don't know. Maybe.
- <i>Find out.</i>

28:18.238 --> 28:20.783
<i>I need to know
if he's working with Declan.</i>

28:20.867 --> 28:22.243
I'll see what I can find.

28:22.327 --> 28:25.997
Do it now, and call me
the moment you find anything!

28:31.002 --> 28:32.795
He just walked himself in?

28:32.878 --> 28:35.423
Yeah, waiting for his lawyer.
but ready to talk.

28:35.507 --> 28:37.883
Well, that doesn't happen every day,
now, does it?

28:39.468 --> 28:41.387
Declan came to see me.

28:41.470 --> 28:43.055
At my house.

28:43.138 --> 28:46.810
Told me to expect a gift.
This must be it.

28:46.893 --> 28:48.437
- Did he threaten you?
- Not at all.

28:48.520 --> 28:50.813
Just told me not to question it.

28:50.897 --> 28:52.999
- And you didn't tell me about this?
- There was nothing to tell...

28:53.023 --> 28:55.152
Until now.

28:55.235 --> 28:59.197
The question is, how did he get Enzo
to turn? And what does he really want?

28:59.280 --> 29:02.408
You got one of the Cosoleto brothers
turning witness.

29:02.492 --> 29:04.452
Wrap that up.
Take care of the rest later.

29:04.535 --> 29:08.330
Declan's getting rid of the competition
and using us to do it.

29:08.413 --> 29:10.875
Even if he is, guys,
does it really matter?

29:10.958 --> 29:12.377
He delivered.

29:12.460 --> 29:16.380
Declan is doing
our job better than we are.

29:16.463 --> 29:18.467
You're OK with that?

29:18.550 --> 29:21.385
This is exactly the kind of arrest
we want for this office

29:21.468 --> 29:23.303
and that you want for your career.

29:23.387 --> 29:27.808
This is a press conference.
Hell, this is a movie!

29:31.897 --> 29:35.065
OK, just let me do the talking.
I don't want you saying a word.

29:36.483 --> 29:37.902
Renata!

29:37.985 --> 29:39.237
Nellie!

29:39.320 --> 29:40.863
Of course!

29:40.947 --> 29:43.575
Renata, Ken. Ken, Renata.

29:43.658 --> 29:46.493
Lawyer to the underworld.

29:47.953 --> 29:51.332
Enzo, she used to work for Vito.
You trust her?

29:51.415 --> 29:54.877
Nellie, always brightening up
every room she walks into.

29:54.960 --> 29:56.753
Nice to meet you, Ken.

29:56.838 --> 29:59.340
- Where's Valentina?
- I don't know.

29:59.423 --> 30:02.103
- That's why I called the cops.
- I don't believe that for a second.

30:02.177 --> 30:04.137
Why not call the scumbag
she cheated with?

30:04.220 --> 30:06.347
Alright, that's enough.
Enzo, stop talking.

30:06.430 --> 30:08.808
She left the baby at home alone.

30:08.892 --> 30:11.978
She probably jumped off a bridge
because of everything you put her through.

30:12.062 --> 30:14.230
Enzo, stop talking.

30:15.940 --> 30:18.275
Nellie, come on.

30:18.358 --> 30:19.818
You know how this works.

30:19.902 --> 30:23.280
No. I have no idea
what all this is about.

30:23.363 --> 30:25.115
What are you doing here?

30:25.200 --> 30:29.787
My client is prepared
to give up some information.

30:29.870 --> 30:31.957
I have strongly advised him against it.

30:32.040 --> 30:34.417
- Just get to what you want.
- I want my son safe.

30:34.500 --> 30:36.252
I can't make that charge go away.

30:36.335 --> 30:39.005
We understand that.
My client wants to...

30:39.088 --> 30:42.092
I want my son brought
to a country-club prison.

30:42.175 --> 30:44.885
White collar, big yard, no gangs.

30:44.968 --> 30:46.512
A place where no one gets hurt.

30:46.595 --> 30:50.683
You know what I'm talking about.
This is not negotiable.

30:50.767 --> 30:53.477
When he's moved and safe,
we can talk.

30:54.478 --> 30:57.273
And you're gonna tell me everything.

30:57.357 --> 31:00.150
About you, your brother,

31:01.360 --> 31:04.655
your nephew,
Teresa and Christian.

31:04.738 --> 31:08.492
First of all, my nephew had
nothing to do with anything.

31:08.577 --> 31:10.578
He's pure as a baby. You got that?

31:10.662 --> 31:13.790
- Come on!
- Oh, Nellie, seriously.

31:13.873 --> 31:17.043
- What do you care about this kid?
- Fine.

31:17.127 --> 31:19.878
When I know Nats is moved,

31:19.962 --> 31:22.173
I'll tell you everything
your heart desires.

31:22.257 --> 31:23.423
Enzo.

31:24.592 --> 31:27.595
You're really gonna rat on your brother?

31:27.678 --> 31:30.348
What are you trying to do?
Talk him out of it now?

31:30.432 --> 31:32.642
I just wanna be sure
of what I'm getting into.

31:34.310 --> 31:35.937
So, Enzo?

31:36.812 --> 31:39.107
Because there's no
going back if you do.

31:40.608 --> 31:42.693
What are you waiting for?

31:42.777 --> 31:45.738
Move my son now. He's not safe!

31:46.905 --> 31:49.658
Why isn't he safe?

31:53.913 --> 31:57.333
Just get it done,
or I'm walking him out of here.

32:07.843 --> 32:10.262
You got a secret admirer?

32:10.347 --> 32:11.888
Too many to mention.

32:16.477 --> 32:17.478
An address.

32:19.772 --> 32:21.232
That's it.

32:21.315 --> 32:24.110
- You know what it is?
- No.

32:31.533 --> 32:34.703
Looks like a residential
condo building downtown.

32:34.787 --> 32:38.165
The fingerprint match on that lighter
you requested from Italian police?

32:38.248 --> 32:40.585
It's Teresa Longana.

32:40.668 --> 32:43.295
With Enzo's testimony
and that match,

32:43.378 --> 32:44.797
we have enough to bring her in.

32:44.880 --> 32:47.217
Right, if we could find her.

32:51.803 --> 32:54.098
Declan said he was giving us a gift.

32:54.182 --> 32:56.100
Enzo was just the start.

32:57.685 --> 33:00.145
This is where we'll find her.

33:00.228 --> 33:02.357
This is our chance to get the twins.

33:02.440 --> 33:04.692
I'll meet you guys at the car.
I just gotta do one thing.

33:04.775 --> 33:06.735
Make it quick!

33:15.537 --> 33:16.537
Good!

33:33.637 --> 33:35.390
I told you not to come.

33:35.473 --> 33:37.767
- And yet here I am.
- And here you are.

33:37.850 --> 33:39.690
Alright, we're gonna
sit tight until they move.

33:40.687 --> 33:42.772
They're gonna be coming
right out of that garage.

33:42.855 --> 33:45.775
They'll be pulling out of there.
one, two, three cars. We don't know.

33:45.858 --> 33:48.610
Park your truck across
from Shelley's and lay low.

33:48.693 --> 33:52.573
Remember, when you follow,
don't get too close, hang back.

33:52.657 --> 33:55.367
- We won't lose them.
- Let's get ready.

33:55.452 --> 33:57.245
- We're ready.
- Good!

34:27.023 --> 34:29.443
What apartment are they in?

34:49.797 --> 34:51.340
RCMP! Open up!

34:51.422 --> 34:52.842
Open it.

35:01.767 --> 35:03.518
- Police!
- Police!

35:03.602 --> 35:04.520
Police!

35:04.603 --> 35:06.105
Come out!

35:18.575 --> 35:19.868
Present yourself!

35:20.870 --> 35:22.830
Room's clear!

35:22.913 --> 35:24.707
No one here.

35:24.790 --> 35:25.917
Damn it!

35:27.668 --> 35:30.378
I want plain-clothed officers
surrounding the building.

35:40.347 --> 35:43.767
We are getting a helicopter
that will fly us to a jet in Albany,

35:43.852 --> 35:46.603
and that will take us home.
See you soon.

36:08.292 --> 36:09.877
Doors opening.

36:09.960 --> 36:11.795
That's them.

36:18.593 --> 36:20.387
There's only two. Two SUVs.

36:20.470 --> 36:22.180
<i>Rose, follow close behind me.</i>

36:22.265 --> 36:24.409
Shelley, we don't need you now.
Get back to your family.

36:24.433 --> 36:26.810
Good luck, boss.

36:26.893 --> 36:28.812
Get ready. Here we go.

36:41.408 --> 36:44.662
<i>Rose, stay close.
If they split, we split.</i>

36:44.745 --> 36:46.330
<i>Copy that.</i>

36:46.413 --> 36:48.207
Gotta go.

36:55.255 --> 36:56.298
Yeah?

36:56.382 --> 36:59.302
<i>You are a man of your word.
I will give you that.</i>

36:59.385 --> 37:01.262
Yeah, which part?
Cos you're not dead yet.

37:01.345 --> 37:03.513
You don't give up.

37:04.640 --> 37:07.058
<i>A long time ago, I learned
something very important.</i>

37:07.142 --> 37:09.270
In our business,
there's not a lot of difference

37:09.353 --> 37:11.563
between people who win
and people who lose.

37:11.647 --> 37:16.402
It's not about opportunity
or vision or grit. No.

37:16.485 --> 37:22.073
The ones who win are the ones who suss
people up right and suss people up fast.

37:22.157 --> 37:23.533
Interesting.

37:24.827 --> 37:26.953
My father told me much the same.

37:27.037 --> 37:28.580
<i>You should've listened better...</i>

37:28.663 --> 37:33.002
- cos you were dead wrong about me.
- <i>No, I was right about you,</i>

37:33.085 --> 37:35.630
but I misjudged our family.

37:37.507 --> 37:38.757
You did not.

37:38.840 --> 37:42.678
Most people will protect that one thing
they love more than themselves.

37:42.762 --> 37:44.930
It's just knowing what that is.

37:46.682 --> 37:50.018
I don't think it's what
people love the most.

37:50.102 --> 37:52.772
I think it's what people need.

37:53.938 --> 37:55.983
What do you think that is for me?

37:56.067 --> 37:57.693
Couldn't care less.

37:57.777 --> 38:00.070
<i>Well, let me tell you
what I think that is for you.</i>

38:00.153 --> 38:04.575
<i>For a moment, I thought it was Reggie,
but it's not.</i>

38:04.658 --> 38:09.205
<i>More than anything,
what you need is independence.</i>

38:10.455 --> 38:14.085
Your truest self exists
when you are alone.

38:16.212 --> 38:18.797
It's why you are so good
at what you do.

38:20.632 --> 38:22.300
It's sad.

38:24.512 --> 38:28.098
But it's, uh, quite beautiful.

38:30.392 --> 38:32.018
Wow!

38:32.102 --> 38:34.730
Going home empty-handed
to your daddy,

38:34.813 --> 38:37.567
it's like a bitter pill to swallow, huh?

38:37.650 --> 38:39.193
Oh, it is.

38:39.277 --> 38:43.280
I will not be welcome
until I've done as asked.

38:43.363 --> 38:46.658
Well, if you're planning on coming back,
I suggest you rethink that.

38:51.413 --> 38:52.873
You're here!

38:52.957 --> 38:54.625
I just wanted to say goodbye.

38:54.708 --> 38:56.585
Siro, he's following us!

38:56.668 --> 38:58.420
They are right behind us.

39:01.507 --> 39:03.800
<i>Christian, </i> we are being followed.

39:14.853 --> 39:16.730
I have to go! I have to go!

39:16.813 --> 39:18.440
<i>They're firing!</i>

39:18.523 --> 39:20.442
Turn around now!

39:22.027 --> 39:23.278
Go get my brother!

39:23.362 --> 39:25.072
They're turning around.

39:40.755 --> 39:42.465
Get ready.

40:26.342 --> 40:28.718
No! No! No!

40:30.720 --> 40:32.430
No! Please!

40:32.515 --> 40:34.225
Please! No!

40:41.648 --> 40:42.648
Uhh!

40:45.068 --> 40:46.528
No!

40:46.612 --> 40:48.613
We have to go now!

40:48.697 --> 40:49.948
No!

40:51.867 --> 40:54.287
- No, Christian!
- We have to go!

40:54.370 --> 40:56.830
- No! No!
- We have to go!

40:56.913 --> 40:58.082
No!

40:58.165 --> 41:00.792
No! Christian!

41:02.503 --> 41:03.795
Rose!

41:16.017 --> 41:18.060
- Hey, Rose! You got hit?
- I'm OK.

41:18.143 --> 41:19.603
- Are you alright?
- I'm OK.

41:19.687 --> 41:22.022
You're gonna be alright.
Come on, we gotta to go.

41:25.150 --> 41:28.612
Come on, come on, come on!

41:41.708 --> 41:44.168
Pop! Call me back, please!

41:48.965 --> 41:51.385
Just a little bit more of this, OK?

41:51.468 --> 41:53.970
- Ow!
- I know, I know.

41:54.053 --> 41:55.347
Alright.

41:57.850 --> 41:59.810
You are so lucky.

41:59.893 --> 42:02.228
You should buy a lotto ticket.

42:02.312 --> 42:05.023
- That was crazy. That was insane.
- I know.

42:06.233 --> 42:08.277
I know, I know.

42:09.278 --> 42:11.072
We got 'em.

42:12.155 --> 42:16.952
Well.. we got Christian,
but not Teresa.

42:18.412 --> 42:20.122
She'll be long gone soon.

42:20.205 --> 42:22.405
She'll be heading out of
the country before you know it.

42:24.083 --> 42:25.627
You won.

42:33.052 --> 42:35.762
Get some rest. Let that heal.

42:35.845 --> 42:37.222
OK?

42:37.305 --> 42:39.683
I can't rest. I'm totally wired.

42:40.850 --> 42:42.310
Aren't you?

43:02.957 --> 43:06.085
- Oh, my arm!
- Sorry! Sorry!

43:53.048 --> 43:55.383
The helicopter will be there
in half an hour.

44:00.305 --> 44:02.850
- What?
<i>- I found Declan.</i>

44:02.933 --> 44:05.727
And his girlfriend too.

44:06.728 --> 44:08.147
What do you want me to do?

44:09.272 --> 44:11.067
Wait for me.

44:12.985 --> 44:15.153
You have to leave the country.

44:16.280 --> 44:18.198
Look, he killed Christian.

44:18.282 --> 44:21.410
I am not going anywhere until
this is done and we kill them all.

44:22.660 --> 44:24.663
Delay the helicopter.

44:25.663 --> 44:27.540
We need a car.

44:28.667 --> 44:32.295
<i>Next time on </i> Bad Blood:
- What about Teresa? Any leads?

44:32.378 --> 44:34.524
We sent her picture out to every cop
in three provinces.

44:34.548 --> 44:36.318
<i>If we haven't found her yet,
she's probably gone.</i>

44:36.342 --> 44:38.843
This is who we want.

44:38.927 --> 44:42.807
Do you want to be a general
or do you want to stay a foot soldier?

44:42.890 --> 44:44.223
Where is my father?

44:44.307 --> 44:47.895
- I want you to be around for a long time.
- I'm not going anywhere.

44:47.978 --> 44:51.815
When Declan arrives,
do not hesitate. I want him dead.

44:51.898 --> 44:52.898
It's all arranged.

44:53.442 --> 44:56.027
<i>The bikers are working with Teresa.</i>

44:56.112 --> 45:00.073
Tomorrow I'm gonna leave here
and I'm gonna go to war.
