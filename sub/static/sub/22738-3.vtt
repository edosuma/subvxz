WEBVTT

00:12.613 --> 00:14.782
WOMAN:
Confirming
that we've moved Car 27.

00:14.815 --> 00:18.086
Now all Spearfish resources
are fully reallocated

00:18.119 --> 00:20.521
to Operation Prairie Dog.

00:20.554 --> 00:22.523
Cartel is making a new play
from the south, guys.

00:22.556 --> 00:26.227
All operatives,
keep your eyes on the ground.

00:26.260 --> 00:28.396
TOLBECK: You know,
I think you're wrong.

00:28.429 --> 00:30.264
I don't think this
is a demotion.

00:30.298 --> 00:32.266
This place is nice.

00:32.300 --> 00:35.269
This place couldn't be
more of a demotion for us.

00:35.303 --> 00:36.737
Are you serious?

00:36.770 --> 00:38.539
Operation Prairie Dog?
This has been going for, like,

00:38.572 --> 00:40.274
eight, ten years.

00:40.308 --> 00:41.642
I think we've been here before.

00:45.546 --> 00:46.780
Oh!

00:46.814 --> 00:49.117
Jesus. You okay, pal?

00:49.150 --> 00:51.119
Yeah, I'm fine. It's just
a little tickle in my throat.

00:51.152 --> 00:53.554
You sure?l. Yes.

00:53.587 --> 00:55.556
It sounds like you're about
to die in the third act.

00:55.589 --> 00:57.691
What are you talking about?

00:57.725 --> 00:59.160
You know, in movies, how they...

00:59.193 --> 01:00.628
the character coughs,
and then they die.

01:00.661 --> 01:02.163
You did the-- once
they cough, you go,

01:02.196 --> 01:03.564
"Oh, that character's
gonna die, for sure."

01:03.597 --> 01:04.698
You know, like Nicole Kidman

01:04.732 --> 01:06.767
in, uh, Moulin Rouge!

01:08.169 --> 01:09.570
You go, oh, TB, blah.

01:09.603 --> 01:10.771
Yep., on the handkerchief.

01:10.804 --> 01:12.273
Or, um...

01:12.306 --> 01:13.407
what's the other one..
Straight Outta Compton?

01:13.441 --> 01:15.576
Eazy-E coughs,

01:15.609 --> 01:17.245
Hmm. from AIDS.

01:17.278 --> 01:19.313
Okay, how's this?

01:19.347 --> 01:21.882
"Sweetheart, get ready, we're
gonna go on a lovely vaca..."

01:23.751 --> 01:25.853
"Oh, no, I'm fine."

01:25.886 --> 01:28.656
That's good. I think it'd-- but
I think it should be more like,

01:28.689 --> 01:30.191
"Sweetheart, get ready,

01:30.224 --> 01:31.425
we're about to go on
a lovely vacati..."

01:40.701 --> 01:42.903
"I'm fine. I'm fine."

01:42.936 --> 01:44.672
:
Wow.

01:44.705 --> 01:46.907
That's pretty good.

01:46.940 --> 01:48.509
Oh, hey,
I thought of an exception.

01:48.542 --> 01:49.877
Chewie.

01:49.910 --> 01:53.847
He coughs all through those
movies, and he never dies.

01:53.881 --> 01:56.450
He... He's not coughing.

01:56.484 --> 01:57.885
He's-he's talking.

01:59.653 --> 02:01.622
Are you serious?
He's not...

02:01.655 --> 02:04.358
That-- it...

02:04.392 --> 02:05.759
YThat's Chew...

02:05.793 --> 02:07.428
He's not clearing his
throat for six movies.

02:07.461 --> 02:09.730
He's... that he's
talking to the guy.

02:09.763 --> 02:10.864
Okay, good. I'm glad.

02:10.898 --> 02:12.433
I really like the character.

02:12.466 --> 02:14.202
I'm glad he didn't die.

02:14.235 --> 02:16.804
Hmm.

02:20.741 --> 02:21.709
Ooh.

02:21.742 --> 02:23.711
Yeah. That's good.

02:23.744 --> 02:25.713
No, I wasn't acting,
that was a real cough.

02:25.746 --> 02:26.780
Oh. Are you okay?

02:26.814 --> 02:29.250
Okay.ine.

02:29.283 --> 02:32.386
("Happiness, Missouri"
by El Vy playing)

02:32.420 --> 02:36.257
* While away while
someone counts the minutes *

02:36.290 --> 02:40.761
* Happiness, Missouri,
I got to get your mind off *

02:40.794 --> 02:44.265
* By the way,
I told you we were in this *

02:44.298 --> 02:48.402
* Happiness, Missouri,
I got to get your mind off it. *

02:48.436 --> 02:50.438
*

03:06.987 --> 03:08.956
TOLBECK:
Ooh, what's that?

03:08.989 --> 03:12.893
I, uh, just followed, uh,
Fatima on, uh, social media.

03:12.926 --> 03:14.962
:
So, Fatima.

03:14.995 --> 03:17.931
No. Not... her voice like that.

03:17.965 --> 03:19.933
:
No.ima.

03:19.967 --> 03:21.435
Hey, I thought
we weren't going there.

03:21.469 --> 03:22.703
Correct.

03:22.736 --> 03:23.971
W-We aren't going there.

03:24.004 --> 03:25.673
Mm. going there. Alone, okay?

03:25.706 --> 03:26.907
I don't need you here
for this ride, because...

03:26.940 --> 03:29.610
JANICE:
Car 27, please report. Car 27.

03:29.643 --> 03:32.613
Uh, Car 27. No activity.

03:32.646 --> 03:33.981
H

03:34.014 --> 03:35.983
H-How's-how's Fatima
doing, Janice?

03:36.016 --> 03:37.551
She's fine.

03:38.952 --> 03:40.588
Okay, you know,
speaking from both of us,

03:40.621 --> 03:42.590
uh, we think she's doing great.

03:42.623 --> 03:43.857
And, uh, yeah,

03:43.891 --> 03:45.726
Thank you,just pass that on.

03:45.759 --> 03:47.461
Detective Cullen.
I appreciate that.

03:47.495 --> 03:48.962
Oh, I didn't know
you were there. Uh...

03:48.996 --> 03:50.564
Just-just call me,

03:50.598 --> 03:51.999
just call me,
just-- there's,

03:52.032 --> 03:53.000
you don't have to
call me Detective.

03:53.033 --> 03:54.468
Just call me Cullen.

03:54.502 --> 03:55.836
Copy that.

03:55.869 --> 03:57.004
Dispatch out.

03:57.037 --> 03:57.971
Okay, over.

04:00.341 --> 04:02.576
He seems... kind of fun, or...

04:02.610 --> 04:03.877
No.

04:05.379 --> 04:06.547
I thought we were gonna

04:06.580 --> 04:08.015
No, we-we... together.

04:08.048 --> 04:09.483
You were gonna let me
be your Cupid, so then...

04:09.517 --> 04:11.552
No, I'm not gonna
let you be my Cupid.

04:11.585 --> 04:13.487
We-- I was very
clear about that.

04:13.521 --> 04:15.055
Okay, I'll be doing this alone.

04:15.088 --> 04:17.958
Okay. I've been
very successful with you before,

04:17.991 --> 04:20.461
I've introduced you
to some very nice young ladies.

04:20.494 --> 04:22.830
You have introduced me to
zero nice young ladies.

04:24.064 --> 04:25.366
Ladies, yeah.

04:25.399 --> 04:26.734
Not young.

04:26.767 --> 04:27.968
And not nice.

04:28.001 --> 04:29.603
What about Carly?

04:29.637 --> 04:31.972
Yes.y the UFC fighter?

04:32.005 --> 04:33.774
She's an athlete.She...

04:33.807 --> 04:35.042
No, she's not an athl...

04:35.075 --> 04:37.645
She showed up to dinner
with a black eye.

04:37.678 --> 04:39.380
A full black eye.

04:39.413 --> 04:41.014
We're sitting down,
I-I don't know what to do.

04:41.048 --> 04:43.083
The people at the next table
are, like, "Are you okay?"

04:43.116 --> 04:45.886
She says, "Yeah. I got hit."

04:45.919 --> 04:47.921
Just leaves that hanging there.

04:47.955 --> 04:49.089
Well, it's the truth.

04:49.122 --> 04:50.691
I mean, what do you
want her to say?

04:50.724 --> 04:53.894
I want her to say, "I-I'm
a terrible UFC fighter."

04:53.927 --> 04:55.896
Because I looked up
her record: 0 and 14.

04:55.929 --> 04:58.065
Terrible UFC fighter.

04:58.098 --> 04:59.500
She got no business
being in the ring.

04:59.533 --> 05:01.669
You know what
you should do, Fatima

05:01.702 --> 05:03.704
Tell her a joke.

05:03.737 --> 05:06.006
No. I'm not gonna do that.

05:06.039 --> 05:08.409
Where did Hitler
keep his armies?

05:08.442 --> 05:09.410
I don't care.

05:09.443 --> 05:11.078
Up his sleevies.

05:11.111 --> 05:12.946
I don't even know
where that is.

05:14.147 --> 05:16.083
Oh, okay, yeah..

05:16.116 --> 05:18.118
All right. No,
I thought you said,

05:18.151 --> 05:20.788
I thought you said
"Upper Slieves."

05:20.821 --> 05:22.823
Like that was a place
in Europe or something.

05:22.856 --> 05:24.958
I-- no, I-I get it.
Up his.. sleevies--

05:24.992 --> 05:26.126
you need to enunciate better.

05:26.159 --> 05:27.628
Yeah, you are horrible
at jokes.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.630
Which is why I'm not
telling her a joke.

05:29.663 --> 05:31.432
You know, I can teach you
the art of joke-telling.

05:31.465 --> 05:32.733
That's not necessary.

05:32.766 --> 05:34.402
Not really. know the secret?

05:34.435 --> 05:35.436
C-FAPP.

05:35.469 --> 05:36.504
C

05:36.537 --> 05:37.571
Mm-hmm.

05:37.605 --> 05:39.139
C: casual.

05:39.172 --> 05:40.741
F: familiar.

05:40.774 --> 05:42.843
Is... if you're gonna use
cheese in a joke,

05:42.876 --> 05:45.513
instead of saying "cheese,"
you say "Sargento."

05:45.546 --> 05:48.449
And then, uh, "A" is accent.

05:48.482 --> 05:50.083
If you can do a little funny
voice or an accent,

05:50.117 --> 05:51.585
it always makes the joke better.

05:51.619 --> 05:52.686
Right.

05:52.720 --> 05:55.556
PP? Pregnant pause.

05:55.589 --> 05:56.724
Good. That's great.

05:56.757 --> 05:58.426
And, uh, I'm not gonna do it.

05:58.459 --> 05:59.827
Okay. For example.

05:59.860 --> 06:02.863
Hey, did I tell you
the one about...

06:02.896 --> 06:04.131
:
C.

06:04.164 --> 06:06.867
Mm-hmm. Right.

06:06.900 --> 06:08.469
...the musical octopus?

06:08.502 --> 06:10.938
A guy walks into
a Chili's with an octopus.

06:10.971 --> 06:12.740
Mm-hmm.r. That's good.

06:12.773 --> 06:15.609
And he says,
"50 bucks to anybody

06:15.643 --> 06:18.446
that can play an instrument
better than this octopus."

06:18.479 --> 06:19.747
All right?

06:19.780 --> 06:22.450
So, the first guy, he walks up,
and he has a guitar.

06:22.483 --> 06:23.617
The octopus takes the guitar,

06:23.651 --> 06:25.986
he starts playing it
like he's Jimi Hendrix.

06:26.019 --> 06:27.154
All right?

06:27.187 --> 06:28.188
He's just shredding it.

06:28.221 --> 06:29.490
He loses.

06:29.523 --> 06:31.158
The next guy is a Scottish guy.

06:31.191 --> 06:33.160
Right. a set of bagpipes.

06:33.193 --> 06:35.463
The octopus just stares
at the bagpipes.

06:35.496 --> 06:37.130
The Scottish guy goes,

06:37.164 --> 06:39.199
: "So, you
can't play this, can you?"

06:39.232 --> 06:40.801
Is that an accent
or a silly voice?

06:40.834 --> 06:41.969
Okay.an accent.

06:42.002 --> 06:44.572
And the octopus says,

06:44.605 --> 06:46.139
"Play it?

06:46.173 --> 06:50.478
"As soon as I figure out
how to get his pajamas off...

06:50.511 --> 06:52.713
I'm gonna fuck it."

06:55.215 --> 06:57.050
So, the octopus can talk?

06:57.084 --> 06:58.752
Is that the joke?

06:58.786 --> 07:01.589
No, you are seriously,
like, a joke retard.

07:01.622 --> 07:03.056
Well, okay.

07:03.090 --> 07:05.192
I'm sorry,
I just got a little angry.

07:05.225 --> 07:07.495
Are we saying
the "R" word now?

07:07.528 --> 07:08.662
No, we're not.

07:08.696 --> 07:09.897
Well, you just said it to me.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.899
It's late.

07:11.932 --> 07:14.468
Not so funny.

07:18.271 --> 07:21.942
JANICE: It's just to give Daryl,
my fiancé, a little break.

07:21.975 --> 07:23.210
Just so he can have some space.

07:23.243 --> 07:25.078
Everyone needs space.

07:25.112 --> 07:27.180
JANICE: It's fun to be at
work with Mommy, isn't it?

07:27.214 --> 07:28.949
It's fun, right?

07:28.982 --> 07:32.620
He can pretend to clock in
and clock out, get fired.

07:32.653 --> 07:34.087
Yeah. It's fun
to play in an office.

07:38.692 --> 07:40.628
JANICE: Okay. I think
it's your bedtime.

07:40.661 --> 07:42.963
We set up a little sleeping area
over there. Isn't that cute?

07:42.996 --> 07:44.665
You're gonna be
like a little woodland creature.

07:44.698 --> 07:46.867
Like you're sleeping
Hmm.rneath a bridge.

07:48.201 --> 07:49.703
God, he's cute.

07:49.737 --> 07:51.238
:
He is?

07:51.271 --> 07:54.708
Do you know what the most
Googled question is?

07:54.742 --> 07:57.845
"Is my husband gay?"

07:57.878 --> 07:59.279
Really?

07:59.312 --> 08:00.548
Yeah.

08:00.581 --> 08:02.550
Oh. That's sad.

08:02.583 --> 08:05.586
I wouldn't say it's sad. I mean,
don't judge those people.

08:05.619 --> 08:08.288
They're reaching out for help.
That's what Google's there for.

08:08.321 --> 08:10.991
So, they just Google it and
hopefully they'll get an answer.

08:11.024 --> 08:12.693
You know Yeah.

08:12.726 --> 08:14.595
Because I might be
one of those people.

08:14.628 --> 08:16.597
Are you one of those people?

08:16.630 --> 08:20.267
Let's just say that I might be
having some issues

08:20.300 --> 08:22.603
on the home front
that is kind of

08:22.636 --> 08:24.137
stressing me out
a little bit today. All right?

08:24.171 --> 08:25.305
I don't want to talk about it.

08:25.338 --> 08:26.840
Okay.

08:26.874 --> 08:29.710
If you did want to talk
about it, you can...

08:29.743 --> 08:31.011
I don't know
if you have any desire

08:31.044 --> 08:32.980
to ever get married, Fatima,

08:33.013 --> 08:36.116
but I just hope you don't get
involved with a man who claims

08:36.149 --> 08:38.151
to know nothing,
when one afternoon,

08:38.185 --> 08:41.154
a very well-dressed
gay gentleman--

08:41.188 --> 08:44.024
no hair, bald--
holding a bouquet of flowers,

08:44.057 --> 08:45.993
shows up at
your doorstep

08:46.026 --> 08:47.828
and claims
to have been

08:47.861 --> 08:51.031
in a online relationship
with Daryl for quite some time.

08:51.064 --> 08:53.233
And his goal is to leave
his entire family

08:53.266 --> 08:54.902
just to be with him.

08:54.935 --> 08:57.004
Yeah, okay.

08:57.037 --> 08:59.172
But like I said,
I don't want to discuss it.

08:59.206 --> 09:01.541
Work is not the place to
discuss these kinds of things.

09:03.076 --> 09:05.045
Damn it, I just kick
myself, you know?

09:05.078 --> 09:06.780
I should've seen the signs.

09:06.814 --> 09:09.617
He'd always been
a very generous tipper.

09:09.650 --> 09:11.318
Very generous.

09:29.169 --> 09:30.671
ADRIAN:
Hey, you want
to hear a secret?

09:30.704 --> 09:31.805
Nope.

09:31.839 --> 09:33.774
Not... not one bit?

09:33.807 --> 09:36.343
Not one bit.

09:36.376 --> 09:39.346
You know what, maybe
Okay, great.a tell you.

09:39.379 --> 09:42.382
You're gonna have a baby
brother.

09:42.415 --> 09:44.184
I've been dying
to tell you this.

09:44.217 --> 09:46.219
You got my mom pregnant?

09:46.253 --> 09:47.755
No, no, no, no.

09:47.788 --> 09:51.224
No, not yet.
But I'm gonna. Yeah.

09:51.258 --> 09:52.359
You're sure about that?

09:52.392 --> 09:54.327
What are you talking about?

09:54.361 --> 09:59.700
I am bursting, like a...
like a tub of fresh yogurt.

09:59.733 --> 10:01.368
Thick Greek yogurt.

10:01.401 --> 10:04.004
Does that make sense?

10:04.037 --> 10:06.840
Okay, okay, okay, I got it.

10:06.874 --> 10:10.678
I got it.
Uh...

10:10.711 --> 10:13.213
how old are you, actually?

10:13.246 --> 10:15.382
You mean my real age
or my sperm age?

10:15.415 --> 10:19.252
'Cause I'll give you
my sperm age: 19.

10:19.286 --> 10:22.222
That's not a thing...
That is a thing.

10:22.255 --> 10:25.726
It's just coming to light
in scientific circles now.

10:25.759 --> 10:28.328
They don't even care how "old"
you are, they just ask you now,

10:28.361 --> 10:30.397
"What's your sperm age?"
And I'm 19.

10:30.430 --> 10:32.833
I came from the ball sack
of a 19-year-old.

10:32.866 --> 10:36.136
And young sperm begets
young sperm.

10:36.169 --> 10:37.437
There you have it.

10:37.470 --> 10:39.707
Your dad was old, right?

10:39.740 --> 10:41.141
He was older.

10:41.174 --> 10:42.943
Older. Older gentleman?

10:42.976 --> 10:44.812
How did you know
my dad was older?

10:44.845 --> 10:47.280
You have what they call
in the medical profession,

10:47.314 --> 10:49.983
"old-ball face."

10:50.017 --> 10:51.985
You came from old balls.

10:52.019 --> 10:55.222
Yeah, that's the face... that's
an old-ball face right there.

10:55.255 --> 10:57.024
No

10:57.057 --> 10:58.992
Th-This is not a bad thing.

10:59.026 --> 11:01.895
Look, a lot of handsome
guys have had that

11:01.929 --> 11:03.030
distinguished, withered look.

11:03.063 --> 11:04.364
Ronald Reagan.

11:04.397 --> 11:07.901
Anyone in any of
the westerns, you know,

11:07.935 --> 11:10.904
from 1950s on.

11:10.938 --> 11:11.772
I mean, it was a complete asset.

11:11.805 --> 11:14.875
Someone like me,
I wouldn't get hired.

11:14.908 --> 11:17.778
Old baby face here, you know,

11:17.811 --> 11:20.447
they'd show me the door.

11:20.480 --> 11:25.452
Now, see, I came from young
balls. Yeah. I'm strong.

11:25.485 --> 11:28.055
I've never been
to a doctor.

11:28.088 --> 11:30.490
I've never seen
the inside of a hospital.

11:30.523 --> 11:32.192
I've never watched
a medical show.

11:32.225 --> 11:35.062
All right? I mean,
if I get a paper cut,

11:35.095 --> 11:36.797
it just scabs up--
there's no blood.

11:36.830 --> 11:37.865
All right?

11:37.898 --> 11:40.200
I don't need glasses,
I don't have health insurance,

11:40.233 --> 11:42.002
I've never broken a bone,
I never will.

11:42.035 --> 11:44.037
I've never sprained
a ligament.

11:44.071 --> 11:47.007
I can do that.

11:47.040 --> 11:47.808
No big deal.

11:47.841 --> 11:49.342
Didn't hurt your
knee or anything?

11:49.376 --> 11:51.478
No. one bit.

11:51.511 --> 11:53.346
So, anyway...

11:53.380 --> 11:57.084
I would love to
test this theory.

11:59.319 --> 12:00.954
Just-just punch you

12:00.988 --> 12:04.057
one good time,
right in the face.

12:04.091 --> 12:06.526
I'm probably too quick,
you know,

12:06.559 --> 12:09.362
for you to even punch me.

12:09.396 --> 12:11.965
Whew.

12:11.999 --> 12:13.433
Could've got you.

12:13.466 --> 12:15.335
Could've. Didn't.

12:20.140 --> 12:22.509
JANICE: Car 55,
thanks for checking in. Out.

12:22.542 --> 12:25.312
Aw. Look at him sleeping.

12:25.345 --> 12:27.114
When they look like that,

12:27.147 --> 12:29.116
it makes you fall in love
with 'em all over again.

12:29.149 --> 12:31.151
Mmm.

12:31.184 --> 12:34.121
Yeah. I'm a little worried
about him, though.

12:34.154 --> 12:36.156
Hmm

12:36.189 --> 12:38.125
I'm saying I'm a little
Yeah.ed about...

12:38.158 --> 12:40.327
We can talk. That can wait....

12:40.360 --> 12:43.496
I'm saying I'm a little worried
about him, my teenage boy.

12:43.530 --> 12:45.132
Oh.

12:45.165 --> 12:46.834
You know, at school, you
know, the girls are kind of

12:46.867 --> 12:48.836
picking on him a lot,
teasing him,

12:48.869 --> 12:50.370
Oh. Yeah.n of him.

12:50.403 --> 12:54.541
So I encouraged him to write
to his cousin Georgia.

12:54.574 --> 12:57.010
He's never met Georgia,
and she's a little bit older,

12:57.044 --> 12:59.346
but I thought it'd be nice
Mm-hmm. a pen pal.

12:59.379 --> 13:02.082
You know, get in the habit of
writing nice letters, and plus,

13:02.115 --> 13:03.250
it helps with the handwriting,

13:03.283 --> 13:05.118
because his handwriting
is atrocious.

13:05.152 --> 13:06.887
Yeah., it's a lost art.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.155
So he would give me
the letters,

13:08.188 --> 13:09.289
and I would pretend
to mail 'em,

13:09.322 --> 13:11.558
and I would write back
as Georgia.

13:11.591 --> 13:13.293
Wait, you would write back
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:13.326 --> 13:14.561
I don't want him really writing
Georgia; she's a whore.

13:14.594 --> 13:16.096
So, then they'd go
back and forth,

13:16.129 --> 13:18.866
and he developed
quite a crush on her.

13:18.899 --> 13:20.968
So, I wrote back,
you know, as Georgia,

13:21.001 --> 13:22.502
saying that I kinda
liked him, too.

13:22.535 --> 13:25.205
But they're cousins, right?

13:25.238 --> 13:27.140
Yeah, but it's me writing it.

13:27.174 --> 13:28.275
Right. That's better,
better that way.

13:28.308 --> 13:29.977
It's better.

13:30.010 --> 13:31.979
So, the letters are getting
hot and heated,

13:32.012 --> 13:34.381
they're getting suggestive,
Oh.y're getting a little filthy.

13:34.414 --> 13:36.316
But I'm going along with it,
because at the same time,

13:36.349 --> 13:38.018
it's kind of adorable.

13:38.051 --> 13:40.020
They're at that age,
they're just experimenting

13:40.053 --> 13:43.223
with the writing--
it's cool, you know?

13:43.256 --> 13:44.591
So, then he started putting
pictures of himself

13:44.624 --> 13:46.059
Wow.hese letters.

13:46.093 --> 13:48.195
Photos of...
Photos of his...?

13:48.228 --> 13:49.329
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
but I'm his mother,

13:49.362 --> 13:50.563
and I've seen it all before.

13:50.597 --> 13:52.332
It's not a big deal.
So, anyway,

13:52.365 --> 13:53.934
so now he wants
a picture of Georgia.

13:53.967 --> 13:55.936
So, I'm in a little
bit of a biMm...

13:55.969 --> 13:57.537
Yeah, I can see that's...

13:57.570 --> 13:59.472
that's tough.
Yeah, but it's last-minute,

13:59.506 --> 14:02.242
and I could really...
I'm asking you for a favor,

14:02.275 --> 14:05.045
if maybe I could have
a naked picture of you
from the neck down

14:05.078 --> 14:08.115
that I can put in the next
letter, which is due tomorrow.

14:10.050 --> 14:11.351
No.

14:11.384 --> 14:13.320
Janice,
I'm not gonna do that.

14:13.353 --> 14:14.421
No, I think
you're misunderstanding.

14:14.454 --> 14:16.023
It's just from the neck down.

14:16.056 --> 14:17.357
I meanAbsolutely not.r face.

14:17.390 --> 14:18.658
I don't... want your son

14:18.691 --> 14:21.194
to have a naked photo of me.

14:21.228 --> 14:22.963
It's not a big deal.
Kids do it all the time.

14:22.996 --> 14:25.098
What, do you want me
to go up to a complete stranger

14:25.132 --> 14:26.633
and just ask a stranger
for a naked picture?

14:26.666 --> 14:28.168
Let me tell
you something.

14:28.201 --> 14:29.502
One day, you're
gonna have a kid,

14:29.536 --> 14:31.104
and you're gonna
come to me,

14:31.138 --> 14:33.373
and you're gonna ask me
for a naked picture.

14:33.406 --> 14:35.642
You know what I'm gonna say?
I'm gonna say yes.

14:35.675 --> 14:37.945
Because that's the
decent thing to do.

14:37.978 --> 14:40.113
Okay?

15:01.734 --> 15:04.137
Oh, I get it. It's cool.

15:04.171 --> 15:05.672
You don't speak English.

15:07.540 --> 15:09.476
Mmm. I get it.
You don't understand.

15:09.509 --> 15:12.012
Yeah. Did you know I'm
fucking your mother tonight?

15:12.045 --> 15:16.283
Uh, I'm getting very,
like, upset inside.

15:16.316 --> 15:18.651
You do speak English.

15:18.685 --> 15:21.421
I think we should get back
to work, cabrón. This is a...

15:21.454 --> 15:24.024
Wait-wait-wait, don't
be a pussy, all right.

15:24.057 --> 15:25.993
Just relax. Okay?

15:26.026 --> 15:28.695
How did you get into
the cartel, anyway?

15:28.728 --> 15:31.098
It was kind of a classic story,
you know.

15:31.131 --> 15:34.334
I, um, I needed the money
really badly.

15:34.367 --> 15:36.669
And they threatened to kill me.
Horribly.

15:41.208 --> 15:42.509
Wh

15:42.542 --> 15:44.711
It's a laugh-track key ring.

15:44.744 --> 15:46.679
eBay, hilarious.

15:46.713 --> 15:48.581
Well, I mean, they did kill
my dog in front of me, so...

15:52.619 --> 15:53.586
I really loved Panchito...

15:56.456 --> 15:58.725
As you probably can guess,
I am comedian.

15:58.758 --> 16:00.727
Never would have guessed that.

16:00.760 --> 16:02.562
YeNo.

16:02.595 --> 16:04.197
Ideas, thoughts, images.

16:04.231 --> 16:06.566
It's all going towards
my comedy special.

16:06.599 --> 16:08.568
Oh. A comeYeah.ecial, huh?

16:08.601 --> 16:10.337
In America, they give
them out like hot dogs.

16:10.370 --> 16:12.472
Do you know what
No.e's called?

16:12.505 --> 16:13.740
"Digger With Attitude."

16:15.375 --> 16:16.609
Oh. I don't get it.

16:16.643 --> 16:19.312
I'm digging all the way
to America. See?

16:19.346 --> 16:22.582
But I have

16:22.615 --> 16:24.617
Oh, is that a joke?

16:26.586 --> 16:28.688
Damn it, I thought
that was good.

16:28.721 --> 16:31.358
Oh, it's okay.
It's just a little...

16:31.391 --> 16:34.361
Um, let's get some cracking
done, you know.

16:34.394 --> 16:35.595
Yes. Yes. Go ahead.

16:35.628 --> 16:37.297
I have to...
I have a migraine.

16:37.330 --> 16:39.499
All right, man.

16:39.532 --> 16:42.069
Hey, digger with
attitude. Huh?

16:42.102 --> 16:43.803
Yeah, okay.k)

16:43.836 --> 16:45.505
Try not to laugh.

16:45.538 --> 16:47.540
Okay.

16:49.542 --> 16:52.245
CULLEN: Hey, speaking of going
on dates, what about you?

16:52.279 --> 16:53.513
Did you ever end up

16:53.546 --> 16:55.615
going deep-sea fishing
with that Leon guy?

16:55.648 --> 16:57.817
Oh, yeah, yeah.

16:57.850 --> 16:59.719
It was fine.
Nothing to tell.

16:59.752 --> 17:02.322
Nothing to tell?
That is a tell.

17:02.355 --> 17:04.124
Okay, there's
something to tell.

17:04.157 --> 17:05.492
Yeah, I can tell.

17:05.525 --> 17:08.661
So, uh, yeah, we, uh,

17:08.695 --> 17:10.663
went deep-sea fishing,
You did do it?

17:10.697 --> 17:12.532
Yeah, we got out there
on the ocean,

17:12.565 --> 17:14.201
we cast our lines out,

17:14.234 --> 17:17.537
we're sitting there, we,
uh, waiting, waiting.

17:17.570 --> 17:19.272
Finally, I get a bite.

17:19.306 --> 17:20.673
Yeah.eally?

17:20.707 --> 17:22.142
I was the first one
Okay.t a bite.

17:22.175 --> 17:23.843
And, uh, I'm pulling it,
and it feels like

17:23.876 --> 17:26.379
this is a pretty
Yeah.ish, you know?

17:26.413 --> 17:29.216
I pull it up, and it is a tuna,
just like Leon said and...

17:29.249 --> 17:30.417
It was beautiful.

17:30.450 --> 17:32.552
One of God's creatures

17:32.585 --> 17:34.421
right there in front
of me, you know.

17:34.454 --> 17:35.555
Anyways, we get it up
on the boat,

17:35.588 --> 17:40.127
and, uh, Leon says,
"We got to kill it."

17:40.160 --> 17:41.694
Okay.

17:41.728 --> 17:43.563
So he hands me this fish bat.

17:43.596 --> 17:46.299
Yeah.bat?

17:46.333 --> 17:48.301
It's like
an aluminum bat...

17:48.335 --> 17:49.702
But like a, like a,
like a baseball bat?

17:49.736 --> 17:52.439
Yeah, like a baseball bat,
but with, like, a hook on it.

17:52.472 --> 17:54.241
Right.

17:54.274 --> 17:57.810
And he just starts beating
the head of the tuna.

17:57.844 --> 17:59.712
Yeah, because
you don't want to ruin

17:59.746 --> 18:03.783
the body and the skin,
and so you just beat it

18:03.816 --> 18:05.452
with the bat on its head

18:05.485 --> 18:08.455
and so, we start
beating this tuna.

18:08.488 --> 18:12.159
I mean, blood was just
squirting everywhere.

18:12.192 --> 18:13.826
Well, you know what
What

18:13.860 --> 18:16.729
The tuna, they make a noise
when they get hit.

18:16.763 --> 18:18.465
What kind of noise?

18:20.733 --> 18:22.735
Yes.they don't. Come on.

18:22.769 --> 18:25.338
Have you ever hit a tuna
No.h a tuna bat?

18:25.372 --> 18:27.207
Okay.shut up and listen.

18:27.240 --> 18:28.908
Okay.horrible.

18:28.941 --> 18:32.279
It literally was like
beating a large dog.

18:32.312 --> 18:34.281
And the thing wouldn't die.

18:34.314 --> 18:36.483
So, Leon brought
these poles out.

18:36.516 --> 18:38.885
They were long and they
were pointy at the end,

18:38.918 --> 18:40.753
basically spears.

18:40.787 --> 18:43.223
And then we just started
poking this thing in the head.

18:43.256 --> 18:44.757
Are you talking
about just poked

18:44.791 --> 18:46.626
or you were stabbing
Stabbing it.he head?

18:46.659 --> 18:48.728
Man, it was tougher
than I thought.

18:48.761 --> 18:51.231
You know.

18:51.264 --> 18:53.633
So, anyways,
we get back to shore,

18:53.666 --> 18:57.637
and, you know...

18:57.670 --> 18:59.906
I don't know,
that was it, I guess.

18:59.939 --> 19:01.774
What, what?

19:01.808 --> 19:04.944
You got back to
Well, you know,

19:04.977 --> 19:07.780
we were covered in blood
and, uh, we, uh,

19:07.814 --> 19:10.350
went back to take a shower.

19:10.383 --> 19:11.918
Together?

19:11.951 --> 19:13.220
Together what?

19:13.253 --> 19:14.554
Did you shower together?

19:14.587 --> 19:15.855
Me and Leon?

19:15.888 --> 19:17.390
Yeah.

19:17.424 --> 19:20.727
Um, no, I, uh, I got
in the shower alone.

19:20.760 --> 19:21.728
Oh, okay.

19:21.761 --> 19:22.862
Yeah, oh,
but he did get in.

19:22.895 --> 19:24.631
While you were in there?

19:24.664 --> 19:26.233
Yes.

19:26.266 --> 19:27.767
So you were together?

19:27.800 --> 19:31.271
Uh, yeah, I don't
really recall. I know...

19:31.304 --> 19:32.805
Well, the way you've
described it is you said

19:32.839 --> 19:34.874
you went in there and
then he went in there.

19:34.907 --> 19:37.410
So, in my mind, I've
Right.u both in there.

19:37.444 --> 19:39.879
Yeah. So...

19:39.912 --> 19:41.981
And so, were you
wearing clothes?

19:42.014 --> 19:43.750
Or were you
showering naked?

19:43.783 --> 19:45.785
Well, I did take
my clothes off,

19:45.818 --> 19:48.488
so I guess you could say
I was naked.

19:48.521 --> 19:50.523
YeaYeah.ay.

19:50.557 --> 19:52.959
Uh...eon?

19:52.992 --> 19:54.594
Was he clothed
or was he naked?

19:54.627 --> 19:55.895
I don't remember.

19:55.928 --> 19:57.830
Don't recall.r?

19:57.864 --> 19:59.899
Hmm. You don't
remember No.t detail?

19:59.932 --> 20:01.901
Feels like the kind of
detail you might remember.

20:01.934 --> 20:03.670
Yeah. I don't know.

20:03.703 --> 20:06.439
It was a big day, so,
I don't know. I can't recall.

20:06.473 --> 20:08.808
Anyways, the point is,
I got a lot of tuna,

20:08.841 --> 20:11.444
so if you want some tuna,
just let me know.

20:11.478 --> 20:16.416
Okay. I don't know if that
is the point, but okay.

20:20.987 --> 20:22.989
Where's my mom?

20:23.022 --> 20:25.625
She's on a break.

20:25.658 --> 20:28.995
Do you have any videos
of you in the nude?

20:29.028 --> 20:30.963
No.

20:30.997 --> 20:32.865
Yeah, yeah, you do.

20:32.899 --> 20:34.166
Or even just titties.

20:40.573 --> 20:42.709
Hey, Mase.

20:42.742 --> 20:45.011
Your mom told me
about Georgia.

20:45.044 --> 20:47.314
Oh, yeah.our cousin.

20:47.347 --> 20:48.881
Mm

20:48.915 --> 20:50.983
Yeah, it was
really revealing.

20:51.017 --> 20:54.053
Getting really into it, huh,
with your cousin Georgia?

20:54.086 --> 20:57.357
Writing back and forth,

20:57.390 --> 20:59.326
Mm-hmm. really explicit.

20:59.359 --> 21:01.461
I think that's normal.
She's your cousin, though.

21:01.494 --> 21:03.763
So that's a little weird.

21:03.796 --> 21:05.365
Some people would say
that's a little weird.

21:05.398 --> 21:06.366
Do you think that's weird?

21:06.399 --> 21:08.768
No. It doesn't bother me.

21:08.801 --> 21:12.872
Hmm. Okay, well, uh, news flash,

21:12.905 --> 21:15.041
you're not writing
to your cousin Georgia.

21:15.074 --> 21:17.844
You're writing to your mom.

21:17.877 --> 21:23.082
Your mom is pretending
to be your cousin Georgia.

21:23.115 --> 21:25.385
And that's who you're

21:25.418 --> 21:27.920
exploring your sexuality with.

21:36.929 --> 21:38.931
I know it was Mom.

21:38.965 --> 21:40.400
I don't care.

21:40.433 --> 21:42.402
I knew from
the first time.

21:42.435 --> 21:44.404
They're just words.

21:44.437 --> 21:45.605
I use them for my own needs.

21:45.638 --> 21:46.906
I can compartmentalize.

21:47.940 --> 21:49.409
JANICE:
Up, up, up, up, up.

21:49.442 --> 21:50.677
There you go.

21:50.710 --> 21:54.013
Okay. Ah.
How'd you two get along?

21:54.046 --> 21:55.848
Good?

22:11.431 --> 22:15.602
You know, before I met you,
I pictured you as a fat guy.

22:17.103 --> 22:19.071
What?

22:19.105 --> 22:20.840
My mom told you I was fat?

22:20.873 --> 22:23.910
No. No. It's your name.

22:23.943 --> 22:28.114
Angus. It's always
the name of a fat guy.

22:28.147 --> 22:30.116
Angus is a fat name?

22:30.149 --> 22:31.718
Yeah.

22:31.751 --> 22:33.686
Do you not name

22:33.720 --> 22:35.455
No. No, I dYeah.

22:35.488 --> 22:38.157
Angus is fat.
Damien is a jerk.

22:38.190 --> 22:39.992
Never met a good Trevor.

22:40.026 --> 22:42.862
John is a pedophile.

22:42.895 --> 22:45.465
Well, or, of all
the pedophiles,

22:45.498 --> 22:46.733
there's gonna be a higher
percentage that are Johns.

22:46.766 --> 22:49.001
Kate, well,

22:49.035 --> 22:51.604
everyone's fucked a Kate.

22:51.638 --> 22:52.772
Right?

22:52.805 --> 22:54.441
I haven't fucked
a Kate, no.

22:54.474 --> 22:57.477
But you fingered her.
Fingered one?

22:57.510 --> 22:59.479
No.

22:59.512 --> 23:02.482
If I go to the bank... right?

23:02.515 --> 23:06.486
And the bank teller is
named either Brad, Joshua

23:06.519 --> 23:10.122
or Gabriela, then I know
they're gonna be attentive

23:10.156 --> 23:12.625
and they're gonna provide me
great service.

23:12.659 --> 23:14.994
This makes no sense, Adrian.

23:15.027 --> 23:16.729
I'm telling you.

23:16.763 --> 23:22.469
You learn how to name-profile,
it's gonna cut at least...

23:22.502 --> 23:26.906
20, 30 hours out of your month
of just wasting time.

23:26.939 --> 23:28.107
Okay.

23:28.140 --> 23:32.178
What about, like a... Raul?

23:32.211 --> 23:34.914
Raul?
Raul, not a problem.

23:34.947 --> 23:39.719
Unless, if you got on an
airplane, the pilot says,

23:39.752 --> 23:44.557
"Good afternoon,
I'm your pilot, Raul," get off.

23:46.859 --> 23:48.595
FATIMA:
Car 27, please report.

23:48.628 --> 23:51.798
No, no, no,
Car 2mine, mine, mine.

23:51.831 --> 23:54.033
Car 27, uh, no activity.

23:54.066 --> 23:55.602
How are you, Fatima?

23:55.635 --> 23:56.669
Um, fine.

23:56.703 --> 23:58.671
CULLEN:
That's great.

23:58.705 --> 24:00.840
Hey, uh, you like music?

24:00.873 --> 24:02.609
Do I like music?

24:02.642 --> 24:03.843
Um, yeah.

24:03.876 --> 24:05.512
Great.

24:05.545 --> 24:08.047
Car 27, you're on open channel.

24:08.080 --> 24:09.682
Oh. Yeah, sorry.

24:09.716 --> 24:11.083
Yeah, uh, flip over to channel
three, please, Fatima.

24:11.117 --> 24:12.852
Copy that.

24:12.885 --> 24:14.086
Just tell her a joke.
C-FAPP.

24:14.120 --> 24:15.955
Okay, okay. All right.
So, casual, casual.

24:15.988 --> 24:17.957
Okay, Ch-Chili's.

24:17.990 --> 24:19.158
No, Chili's?
Chili's.e a... okay.

24:19.191 --> 24:20.159
Are you there, Fatima?

24:20.192 --> 24:21.227
Yeah.

24:21.260 --> 24:22.228
CULLEN:
Uh, yeah, I was just...

24:22.261 --> 24:24.096
did I ever tell you about...

24:24.130 --> 24:27.700
there's-there's an
octopus inside a Chili's.

24:27.734 --> 24:29.636
There-There's-
there's a Chil...

24:29.669 --> 24:31.871
There's a Chili's that an
octopus has-has gone into.

24:31.904 --> 24:33.873
I think that's...
What..isn't that right

24:33.906 --> 24:35.842
Are you telling me a joke?

24:35.875 --> 24:37.109
Abandon that joke.

24:37.143 --> 24:38.711
What iHitler.

24:38.745 --> 24:39.946
I don't know what...
oh, right, okay, okay,

24:39.979 --> 24:41.247
oh, yeah, no,
no, no, I'm good.

24:41.280 --> 24:44.283
Um, where did Hitler
keep his armies?

24:44.316 --> 24:46.118
Where?

24:46.152 --> 24:47.987
Up his.or up...

24:48.020 --> 24:49.121
Okay.

24:49.155 --> 24:51.658
Up his sleevies.

24:54.694 --> 24:55.995
That was a good one.

24:56.028 --> 24:57.997
Yeah.

24:58.030 --> 24:59.799
Yeah, it is.
It is good.

24:59.832 --> 25:01.868
And I think the important thing
to note, what makes it good,

25:01.901 --> 25:03.235
is that we're
laughing at the man,

25:03.269 --> 25:05.237
not with him 'cause,
I... he was, you know,

25:05.271 --> 25:07.239
which-whichever you cut it,
I... he was not a good guy.

25:07.273 --> 25:10.743
And, uh, you know, I think
it's okay to laugh at them.

25:10.777 --> 25:12.745
But I think, if we're
making them, uh...

25:12.779 --> 25:15.715
Would you just ask her
Okay.n a fucking date?

25:15.748 --> 25:17.617
Yeah, and I was, I
was just thinking,

25:17.650 --> 25:19.919
that maybe you and I could,
uh, we could go somewhere,

25:19.952 --> 25:21.854
you know, we could have,
we could go to a Chili's,

25:21.888 --> 25:24.156
you know, anywhere.
We could go to a place.

25:24.190 --> 25:26.859
Are you asking me
out on a date?

25:28.861 --> 25:31.764
Yes.

25:37.169 --> 25:38.738
That's great.
That's great.

25:38.771 --> 25:39.872
Thank you.
Okay, we'll talk later.

25:39.906 --> 25:41.908
Dispatch out.

25:41.941 --> 25:42.875
We did it..

25:42.909 --> 25:44.110
We did it.

25:44.143 --> 25:45.878
We did it.d it.

25:45.912 --> 25:47.780
Oh, man.

25:47.814 --> 25:49.148
Oh, my God.

25:49.181 --> 25:50.883
You know, you're gonna need
another joke for the date.

25:50.917 --> 25:52.652
I don't need another joke.

25:52.685 --> 25:55.121
I got the Hitler joke.
Are you kidding?date.

25:55.154 --> 25:56.789
You're gonna be in a nice,
romantic restaurant.

25:56.823 --> 25:57.890
You need another joke.

25:57.924 --> 25:59.792
Okay, okay, tell
me another joke.

25:59.826 --> 26:02.161
Two vomits are walking down the
street near the San Diego Zoo.

26:02.194 --> 26:05.331
And one-one vomit stops
and he gets really sad.

26:05.364 --> 26:07.967
The other vomit goes,
"Hey, what's wrong with you?"

26:08.000 --> 26:11.070
And the first vomit says,
"Oh, it's just that this

26:11.103 --> 26:13.172
is the corner where
I was brought up."

26:15.975 --> 26:17.143
That's pretty good.

26:17.176 --> 26:19.311
Because it was brought
up in the zoo.

26:19.345 --> 26:21.814
No. It was brought up
on that corner.

26:21.848 --> 26:23.783
Right. But the-the-the zoo.

26:23.816 --> 26:25.084
It was brought up and
lived in-in the zoo.

26:25.117 --> 26:26.218
There was like a
vomit enclosure.

26:26.252 --> 26:28.187
The zoo has nothing
to do with it.

26:28.220 --> 26:31.691
The zoo is the, uh, is the "F,"
familiar, making it familiar.

26:31.724 --> 26:33.225
CULLEN: Right.
That's what makes it funny.

26:33.259 --> 26:34.827
TOLBECK: No, that's not
what makes it funny.

26:34.861 --> 26:36.663
CULLEN:
No, I think that's good.

26:36.696 --> 26:38.330
So, these two vomits,
uh, live at the zoo...

26:38.364 --> 26:41.333
