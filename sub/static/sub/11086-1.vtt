WEBVTT

00:20.996 --> 00:22.790
Hide quickly!

00:22.915 --> 00:25.668
Run away!

00:42.268 --> 00:45.062
Quick! This way!

00:46.856 --> 00:49.024
Quickly!

00:58.617 --> 01:01.328
Down to the lake.

01:25.811 --> 01:30.900
- M... for Mischa.
- Mischa.

01:34.487 --> 01:37.823
Come on!
Come on, let's go!

01:43.829 --> 01:46.415
Come on, Lothar.

01:46.665 --> 01:49.835
- Hurry now. Give me the bathtub.
- Yes, sir.

01:51.754 --> 01:54.465
Hannibal,
Mischa, where have you been?

01:54.590 --> 01:57.927
Hurry now!
Quickly!

01:58.469 --> 02:00.304
Hannibal!

02:00.429 --> 02:02.515
Come here.

02:08.937 --> 02:10.773
Come on!

02:10.898 --> 02:12.316
Darling...

02:12.441 --> 02:16.320
The cart is packed.
Everything is ready.

02:17.863 --> 02:19.573
Hurry up.
Come on, come on.

02:19.698 --> 02:22.451
Come along.
Come on.

02:22.743 --> 02:24.370
Hey.

02:24.495 --> 02:27.581
Colonel Timka says the fighting
will be close to the roads.

02:27.706 --> 02:29.917
Can't last more than a few days.

02:30.042 --> 02:31.752
We'll be safe at the lodge.

02:31.877 --> 02:33.587
Go on!

02:33.712 --> 02:36.841
We're almost there!

02:40.302 --> 02:42.930
No, no, no, no. The bath
has to be for the dirty...

02:43.055 --> 02:44.515
- Yes, madame.
- In you come.

02:44.640 --> 02:45.599
Take this.

02:45.724 --> 02:46.892
Let's see if our toys
are still there.

02:47.017 --> 02:49.019
- Ah, hand me the bathtub.
- I'll take care of that, sir.

02:49.145 --> 02:51.939
No, no. It's fine.
But let's hurry.

02:52.064 --> 02:55.234
Cook will have finished packing
the kitchen by the time you get back.

03:00.573 --> 03:03.284
Mischa...

03:03.826 --> 03:08.831
Hannibal, give them here.
Mama's pearls...

03:16.255 --> 03:18.382
Pearls before swine...

03:22.261 --> 03:25.681
Mischa... blow.

04:20.236 --> 04:22.738
Shut up.
Shut up!

04:27.660 --> 04:31.205
You are a Jew.
How could I eat your cooking?

04:31.330 --> 04:33.791
Dispose of him.

04:35.042 --> 04:38.712
How do you deal with locals,
being locals yourself?

04:38.838 --> 04:43.134
You say you want to be SS.
Let's see you earn it.

04:46.846 --> 04:48.389
Kill the Jew.

04:48.514 --> 04:51.434
Bring me the peasant.

04:52.351 --> 04:55.438
Move! Move!

04:55.563 --> 04:59.650
Move, you fat fucking Jew!
Move! Move!

05:04.155 --> 05:05.448
Are you a gypsy?

05:05.573 --> 05:08.742
No, sir.

05:15.708 --> 05:17.960
Are you a Jew?

05:18.919 --> 05:20.629
No, sir.

05:20.754 --> 05:26.051
Milko. Good job!

05:26.427 --> 05:29.472
Why don't you show us
your dick?

05:31.348 --> 05:32.975
Major!

05:33.100 --> 05:34.435
Russian tanks moving west!

05:34.560 --> 05:36.270
Put all their food
on the trucks.

05:36.395 --> 05:39.523
Move it!

05:49.325 --> 05:52.661
This forest was full of game.

05:52.870 --> 05:55.206
This war...

05:59.251 --> 06:02.421
Find us something
to eat, Lothar.

06:08.010 --> 06:10.805
Which way home, Hannibal?

06:16.602 --> 06:18.938
Good boy.

06:25.111 --> 06:28.405
The Germans are falling back
from Leningrad.

06:28.614 --> 06:31.158
They are in full retreat.

06:31.283 --> 06:37.915
Freezing... and starving.

06:52.388 --> 06:55.266
What's that?

07:02.565 --> 07:03.774
Tank! A Russian tank!

07:03.899 --> 07:07.653
- Get away from the window.
- Lothar! Russians!

07:18.164 --> 07:22.126
Everybody out of the house!

07:34.013 --> 07:38.726
We only want water.
The children can stay in the warm.

07:38.851 --> 07:41.771
- Get them inside.
- Go on. Look after Mischa.

07:41.896 --> 07:43.105
Come here.

07:43.230 --> 07:45.858
Start the pump.

07:58.037 --> 08:00.498
Wait here.

08:01.373 --> 08:02.583
Mama!

08:02.708 --> 08:04.543
Mama!

08:05.961 --> 08:08.005
How much longer
with the pump?

08:08.130 --> 08:10.174
A few minutes.

08:13.052 --> 08:14.929
Stuka!

08:15.054 --> 08:20.226
Stuka! Shoot! Shoot!

08:22.269 --> 08:24.355
Get down!

08:33.530 --> 08:34.448
Papa!

08:34.573 --> 08:37.284
Papa!

09:13.237 --> 09:15.823
Mischa!

09:17.950 --> 09:20.494
Hannibal!

09:21.120 --> 09:24.957
Mama!

09:34.925 --> 09:36.969
Mama!

09:37.720 --> 09:40.014
Mama!

09:40.139 --> 09:42.266
Hannibal!

09:42.808 --> 09:44.101
No!

09:44.226 --> 09:47.104
No! Mischa!

09:47.313 --> 09:50.024
Mischa!
Mischa, go back!

09:50.149 --> 09:51.525
Go back, Mischa!

09:51.650 --> 09:54.528
- Mama!
- No, Mischa, go back!

09:54.653 --> 09:58.032
Hurry! Hurry!

10:08.793 --> 10:12.421
Head shots.
No holes in the clothes.

10:36.570 --> 10:38.906
Come on, Grentz!

10:39.031 --> 10:40.241
Kolnas, come on!

10:40.366 --> 10:41.575
- We're coming!
- Let's go!

10:41.700 --> 10:43.828
Hurry!

10:51.418 --> 10:52.753
Put them in the back.

10:52.878 --> 10:54.463
Come on!
Run, run, run, run, run!

10:54.588 --> 10:56.590
Start the engine.

10:56.715 --> 10:58.676
I told you, Grutas,
we're going to die!

10:58.801 --> 11:01.095
Relax, we're getting rich.

11:01.220 --> 11:03.430
- In! In, in, in!
- Come on, come on!

11:03.556 --> 11:05.391
- Faster, faster!
- Go!

11:06.142 --> 11:09.520
Grutas,
isn't that the SS Major?

11:13.149 --> 11:16.819
Major?
Kill a few gypsies, you said.

11:16.944 --> 11:20.364
Kill a few Jews,
and they'll make you SS.

11:20.489 --> 11:22.450
If you had kept your word,

11:22.575 --> 11:26.829
I would be saying
"yes, sir" to you now.

11:27.413 --> 11:32.418
But now... I am
in business for myself.

11:41.177 --> 11:42.344
He's not one of ours!

11:42.470 --> 11:44.805
Kill him!

11:49.477 --> 11:51.896
Russians!

11:54.815 --> 11:57.651
Get the body.
Hurry!

12:00.946 --> 12:03.491
Don't kill the dead ones,
stupid.

12:04.325 --> 12:07.578
Find the weapons.
Find the weapons!

12:14.919 --> 12:18.422
Go. Go, go, go.
All in.

12:19.840 --> 12:21.884
Come on, come on,
come on.

12:25.805 --> 12:29.892
Dump the body!
Dump the body immediately!

13:12.726 --> 13:15.729
They're shooting looters.

13:15.855 --> 13:18.315
Stop and black out.

13:36.167 --> 13:38.961
Move back!

13:41.797 --> 13:42.798
Don't shoot!

13:42.923 --> 13:45.342
Come on!

13:52.266 --> 13:53.225
Come on.

13:53.350 --> 13:55.478
- Put it down.
- Drop it now, you little fuck!

13:55.603 --> 13:57.480
Put it down!

13:57.605 --> 13:58.939
Or we shoot her.

13:59.064 --> 14:00.524
Give me that.

14:00.649 --> 14:03.068
Get the radio, Kolnas.

14:14.413 --> 14:18.083
We're lucky. Only kids.

14:18.626 --> 14:21.337
If a patrol comes by...

14:21.462 --> 14:24.048
we saved them...

14:25.800 --> 14:27.176
and their family's stuff.

14:27.301 --> 14:28.677
Hey, Dortlich.

14:28.803 --> 14:30.304
Grentz, check the door.

14:30.429 --> 14:32.389
Pot watcher.

14:32.515 --> 14:34.183
Check upstairs.

14:34.308 --> 14:36.519
Find some food.

14:38.604 --> 14:43.526
Hey, only rotten potatoes.

14:49.240 --> 14:53.702
Find something.
Try the... try the Germans.

15:03.879 --> 15:06.340
Listen,
I need information, you idiot.

15:06.465 --> 15:08.175
It's not a fucking toy.

15:08.300 --> 15:12.138
Wait, I have found something
under Russian frequency.

15:19.645 --> 15:21.439
Roadblocks.

15:21.564 --> 15:25.109
Every five kilometers
from here to Vilnius.

15:27.153 --> 15:31.615
So, we're stuck for now?

15:44.837 --> 15:47.214
Once we were Lithuanian.

15:47.339 --> 15:48.716
Now we are Russians.

15:48.841 --> 15:51.594
We were Germans before.

15:52.511 --> 15:53.888
Medics.

15:54.013 --> 15:55.014
Police.

15:55.139 --> 15:58.017
And what are we
at this moment?

15:59.018 --> 16:01.479
At this moment,
we are starving.

16:01.604 --> 16:03.564
Did you get something?

16:03.689 --> 16:04.732
Freezing out there.

16:04.857 --> 16:06.859
Open it.

16:08.527 --> 16:10.946
You think these are
peppercorns?

16:11.071 --> 16:13.365
These are frozen maggots.

16:13.491 --> 16:16.994
This was rotten
before it froze!

16:26.545 --> 16:28.088
I'll put this in your head!

16:28.214 --> 16:30.216
Stop it, Grutas.

16:59.078 --> 17:02.456
The boy is Hannibal Lecter...

17:04.083 --> 17:08.671
...and the little girl is Mischa.

17:39.618 --> 17:41.829
We eat...

17:42.455 --> 17:44.498
...or die.

19:07.790 --> 19:09.959
Let's hear you, little master.

19:10.084 --> 19:12.211
He's a mute.

19:12.336 --> 19:13.838
He's not mute at night.

19:13.963 --> 19:16.924
He can scream well enough,
and he'll sing.

19:17.049 --> 19:20.261
This is not
your father's house anymore.

19:20.386 --> 19:22.388
It's the People's Orphanage,

19:22.513 --> 19:26.308
and you're just
one more orphan.

19:26.934 --> 19:32.231
Lecter!
I'll see you in my office!

19:41.740 --> 19:46.328
Hannibal, you do not honor
the human pecking order.

19:46.454 --> 19:49.248
You're always hurting
the bullies.

19:51.584 --> 19:52.793
I know,

19:52.918 --> 19:56.380
this was your mother's room.

19:56.505 --> 20:00.009
Must be difficult for you
to live in this house.

20:02.219 --> 20:04.054
Go to bed.

20:05.431 --> 20:08.225
Go to bed!

20:16.942 --> 20:19.904
Everything all right?

20:36.045 --> 20:37.880
No, please.

20:43.010 --> 20:44.845
Mischa!

20:46.555 --> 20:48.390
Get up!

20:54.230 --> 20:57.191
Now, scream all you please.

21:04.115 --> 21:06.367
Every day,
you'll pay for this.

21:06.492 --> 21:12.123
Every day for the rest
of your short and nasty life.

23:08.322 --> 23:10.616
Lecter!

23:12.618 --> 23:14.578
He's not here.

23:15.329 --> 23:17.248
This way.

24:04.837 --> 24:06.964
Okay!

24:54.762 --> 24:56.847
Boy!

26:48.751 --> 26:50.211
Who's there?

26:50.336 --> 26:51.295
Some help you are.

26:51.420 --> 26:53.631
Shoo! Go!

26:57.760 --> 26:59.386
What is it, Serge?

26:59.512 --> 27:00.763
A boy, madame.

27:00.888 --> 27:04.308
He has pictures of you
and your husband.

27:39.802 --> 27:42.138
Your uncle would have loved
to see you, Han.

27:42.263 --> 27:47.101
It has been almost a year
since he died.

27:56.652 --> 27:59.738
Only you and I are left now.

28:08.122 --> 28:10.249
Mischa.

28:13.002 --> 28:16.088
Mischa. Mischa.

28:19.175 --> 28:21.510
Mischa.

28:29.977 --> 28:33.147
Mischa! Mischa!

28:33.272 --> 28:35.316
Mischa! Mischa!

28:35.441 --> 28:36.817
Hannibal.

28:36.942 --> 28:38.068
- Mischa!
- Hannibal.

28:38.194 --> 28:41.155
Hannibal! Hannibal!
Wake up!

28:41.280 --> 28:44.408
It's all right.
It's all right.

28:47.077 --> 28:51.290
When you sleep,
do you remember?

28:51.832 --> 28:55.127
Do you remember
what happened to Mischa?

29:19.860 --> 29:22.947
You look like your uncle,
Hannibal.

29:27.034 --> 29:29.411
Would you like to try?

29:29.537 --> 29:31.664
Use this.

29:47.429 --> 29:50.808
Hannibal!

30:28.220 --> 30:30.514
Speak to me.

30:36.520 --> 30:38.856
Thank you.

31:38.791 --> 31:41.085
Hannibal.

31:52.346 --> 31:54.849
Here is where I pray
to my ancestors

31:54.974 --> 31:58.811
for strength, for courage.

32:02.106 --> 32:06.569
I have the honor
only on my ancestor's birthday

32:06.694 --> 32:08.404
to polish his armor

32:08.529 --> 32:11.657
with oil of cloves.

32:26.338 --> 32:30.885
This is after the fight
for Osaka Castle.

32:37.183 --> 32:41.812
The samurai display
the heads of their enemies.

32:42.229 --> 32:47.151
There are more suitable parchments
that will interest you.

32:49.361 --> 32:51.113
Be gentle, Hannibal.

32:51.238 --> 32:53.532
And be brave.

32:54.533 --> 32:56.994
Like your father.

32:59.288 --> 33:01.665
And like him.

33:11.050 --> 33:13.302
You must be ready
for anything.

33:13.427 --> 33:15.346
Come.

33:18.974 --> 33:20.810
Again.

33:24.105 --> 33:26.315
Again.

33:30.653 --> 33:32.113
Good.

33:32.238 --> 33:34.824
- Again.
- All right.

34:19.284 --> 34:20.995
Hey, japonaise.

34:21.120 --> 34:23.998
Hey, japonaise!

34:24.123 --> 34:27.585
Monsieur, please.

34:28.627 --> 34:30.795
- Is that all, madame?
- Yes.

34:31.130 --> 34:33.674
Hey, japonaise,
tell me the truth.

34:33.799 --> 34:36.510
Does your pussy run crossways?

34:36.635 --> 34:40.889
With a puff of straight hairs
like a little explosion?

34:42.808 --> 34:44.685
Hannibal!

34:50.690 --> 34:52.610
Don't move.

35:03.287 --> 35:04.872
The butcher tried
to get the knife

35:04.997 --> 35:08.751
while stating he would
kill everyone in the market.

35:08.918 --> 35:11.170
Well...

35:11.295 --> 35:13.923
The butcher... was Vichy,

35:14.048 --> 35:17.468
a collaborator
with the German occupation.

35:17.593 --> 35:18.803
He's much hated.

35:18.928 --> 35:22.139
And I can deal with him.

35:29.730 --> 35:31.482
Young man...

35:31.607 --> 35:33.609
if you're to be a doctor,

35:33.734 --> 35:35.903
you must be careful
with your hands.

35:36.028 --> 35:37.530
No more fighting,

35:37.655 --> 35:40.825
and never give more
than a single pass.

35:56.882 --> 35:58.425
Forgive me.

35:58.551 --> 36:01.679
I came now to seek revenge.

36:01.887 --> 36:05.099
Hannibal needs peace.

38:30.953 --> 38:34.874
If you've pissed in my fuel tank,
I'll twist your head off!

38:35.374 --> 38:39.003
Paul Momund, the butcher.

38:39.545 --> 38:42.214
You owe a certain lady an apology.

38:42.339 --> 38:44.758
Apologize to la japonaise?

38:44.884 --> 38:48.345
Boy, you must be crazy to come here.
I'll throw you in the river.

38:48.471 --> 38:50.598
Or maybe I'll split your pants

38:50.723 --> 38:52.683
and give you something
you don't want

38:52.808 --> 38:54.477
where you don't want it.

38:54.602 --> 38:59.148
You inquired about her...
pussy.

38:59.273 --> 39:02.943
You speculated
it ran which way?

39:03.068 --> 39:04.862
Jap pussy runs crossways.

39:04.987 --> 39:09.200
You should fuck that little Jap
and see for yourself?

39:09.825 --> 39:11.744
Crossways like that?

39:25.257 --> 39:28.594
Or more tangential
to the spine?

39:44.235 --> 39:47.571
Do you see how your mouth
stains the air?

39:47.696 --> 39:50.825
I should add that
to my drawing.

39:50.950 --> 39:53.577
Would you like to see it?

40:43.711 --> 40:46.046
Wait for me.

40:50.092 --> 40:51.886
You see, it was made
with a single blow.

40:52.011 --> 40:55.306
Ah, Inspector Popil.
I'm very happy you could come.

40:55.431 --> 40:57.892
You won't remember me,
but I was with the...

40:58.017 --> 41:00.394
Of course. You delivered
De Rais to Nuremburg

41:00.519 --> 41:01.771
and sat behind him.

41:01.896 --> 41:04.482
I saw you bring
the evidence.

41:04.857 --> 41:06.859
It's an honor, sir.

41:07.818 --> 41:11.155
- What do we have here?
- Paul Momund, or most of him.

41:11.280 --> 41:13.324
You have his dossier.

41:13.449 --> 41:15.242
Yes.

41:15.367 --> 41:16.744
Fat and ugly.

41:16.869 --> 41:20.372
He shipped Jews
from Marseille.

41:21.207 --> 41:22.917
He fought recently.

41:23.042 --> 41:24.502
And often.

41:24.627 --> 41:28.255
Last Saturday night, a bar fight.
He had many enemies.

41:28.380 --> 41:31.675
A list, please.
His recent opponents.

41:32.134 --> 41:33.719
You've done nothing
to this body?

41:33.844 --> 41:35.679
Oh, no, no, no, monsieur.
No, no.

41:35.805 --> 41:37.264
The chief specifically...

41:37.389 --> 41:38.516
The odor,

41:38.641 --> 41:41.352
it's not of anything
you use here?

41:41.477 --> 41:43.854
It smells like
that toothache remedy.

41:43.979 --> 41:46.148
Yes, oil of cloves.

41:46.273 --> 41:48.609
Let's see the pharmacist.

41:50.236 --> 41:52.196
Look.

41:52.321 --> 41:56.200
The most exquisite bits
of the fish are the cheeks.

41:56.325 --> 41:58.119
This is true
for many creatures.

41:58.244 --> 42:01.372
When carving at the table,
you give one cheek to madame,

42:01.497 --> 42:03.124
the other to the
guest of honor.

42:03.249 --> 42:04.375
Did you hear?

42:04.500 --> 42:08.629
They haven't found the butcher's
damned ugly head yet.

43:34.340 --> 43:37.676
Good evening, my lady.

43:42.139 --> 43:43.641
I hope you don't mind.

43:43.766 --> 43:49.980
I would've used a butcher's knife,
but the sword seemed so appropriate.

44:00.825 --> 44:04.662
Not a nick in the blade,
I promise you.

44:07.039 --> 44:09.750
The butcher was like butter.

44:32.565 --> 44:35.568
You didn't need to
do this for me.

44:35.693 --> 44:38.863
Rudeness is epidemic,
my lady.

44:45.494 --> 44:47.538
Police.

44:52.334 --> 44:54.879
They will call it murder.

44:55.463 --> 44:58.382
At worst,
a crime of passion.

45:02.928 --> 45:04.972
Wash your hands.
Quickly.

45:05.097 --> 45:07.433
Go!

45:09.935 --> 45:12.938
Inspector Pop-il?

45:13.063 --> 45:16.275
- Popil, madame.
- Popil.

45:18.277 --> 45:20.488
Hannibal Lecter?

45:21.280 --> 45:23.282
Good evening.

45:23.407 --> 45:27.328
You fought with the butcher,
Paul Momund, in the market.

45:28.120 --> 45:30.289
Now he is dead.

45:30.915 --> 45:33.501
I must ask you
to come along with me.

45:36.504 --> 45:39.757
Is your name
Hannibal Lecter?

45:39.965 --> 45:42.343
Yes.

45:44.720 --> 45:48.808
Do you have any guilty knowledge
of the death of Paul Momund?

45:48.974 --> 45:50.434
Guilty knowledge?

45:50.559 --> 45:53.896
Limit your responses
to yes or no.

45:55.940 --> 45:58.067
No.

46:02.738 --> 46:04.949
It's vanilla.

46:05.533 --> 46:08.119
He reacts to nothing.

46:09.912 --> 46:12.248
It's monstrous.

46:16.710 --> 46:18.921
The butcher had been fishing.

46:19.046 --> 46:23.217
There was blood and scales
on his knife, but no fish.

46:23.342 --> 46:26.095
The tape tells you
all that?

46:26.595 --> 46:28.806
Remarkable.

46:29.723 --> 46:31.809
No.

46:31.976 --> 46:35.896
The chef told me you brought
a splendid fish in for dinner.

46:36.021 --> 46:38.357
Where did you get that fish?

46:38.482 --> 46:40.359
By fishing, Inspector.

46:40.484 --> 46:44.280
We keep a baited line in the water
behind the boathouse.

46:44.405 --> 46:47.074
I'll show you if you like.

46:47.199 --> 46:50.077
My specialty is war crimes.

46:50.870 --> 46:54.582
And I know they
do not end with the war.

46:54.874 --> 46:57.585
You lost your entire family.

46:58.085 --> 47:00.129
So did I.

47:00.254 --> 47:04.967
And for you, your beautiful aunt came
and made up for it all.

47:05.384 --> 47:08.971
The very scent of her must have
taken away the smell of the camp.

47:09.096 --> 47:12.308
So when Paul the butcher
spewed filth at her,

47:12.433 --> 47:15.686
I can understand
if you killed him.

47:15.895 --> 47:18.314
Tell me what happened, Hannibal.

47:20.107 --> 47:21.984
Together we could
show a court there was...

47:22.109 --> 47:26.530
The very scent of her
takes away the smell of the camp.

47:27.406 --> 47:29.450
Do you compose verse,
Inspector?

47:29.575 --> 47:32.286
And keep it
under your pillow?

47:52.389 --> 47:57.144
Now, tell me, Inspector,
did you choose war crimes...

47:57.436 --> 47:59.647
...because you lost family
in the war?

47:59.772 --> 48:01.816
Yes.

48:01.941 --> 48:04.068
How?

48:04.944 --> 48:07.530
Some in combat,
some were shipped east.

48:07.655 --> 48:09.323
Did you catch who did it?

48:09.448 --> 48:11.659
No.

48:12.284 --> 48:14.495
But they were Vichy,
men like the butcher?

48:14.620 --> 48:16.455
Yes.

48:18.165 --> 48:20.835
Then we are both suspects.

48:20.960 --> 48:24.255
I can say you were
fishing with me, if you like.

48:27.258 --> 48:29.927
Inspector,
you should see this.

48:31.637 --> 48:34.807
I told you...
keep these people away.

48:41.939 --> 48:43.899
- It's the butcher?
- Yes, sir.

48:44.024 --> 48:45.025
How long?

48:45.151 --> 48:48.154
Ten minutes.
No longer.

49:12.386 --> 49:15.264
Wait here, please.

49:18.184 --> 49:23.314
Madame, so sorry to disturb you.
I was passing with the papers.

49:23.439 --> 49:28.194
Your legal residency
in France is threatened, madame.

49:28.319 --> 49:29.904
We can delay the death duties

49:30.029 --> 49:32.239
so you can stay in the house
for the time being,

49:32.364 --> 49:36.619
but inevitably, the state will take it
and sell it at auction.

49:36.744 --> 49:38.788
You will have to
let the staff go.

49:38.913 --> 49:40.790
Good night.

49:50.299 --> 49:54.053
Father, Mother...

49:54.720 --> 49:59.600
I'm the youngest student they've
ever admitted into medical school.

50:00.017 --> 50:02.019
It's a work scholarship.

50:02.144 --> 50:05.481
I think you would be pleased.

50:06.899 --> 50:09.777
Death duties on
my uncle's estate

50:09.902 --> 50:13.656
have finally forced the sale
of the chateau.

50:13.781 --> 50:17.451
Lady Murasaki will
leave for Paris with me.

50:25.417 --> 50:29.463
This work scholarship means
I must spend much of my spare time

50:29.588 --> 50:33.217
preparing bodies
for the anatomy class.

50:35.803 --> 50:37.888
My studies are fascinating

50:38.013 --> 50:41.058
and absorb me completely.

50:45.187 --> 50:48.816
Yet I still find myself thinking
about my sister

50:48.941 --> 50:50.609
and the men who
took her from me.

50:50.734 --> 50:53.612
Let me go!

50:56.949 --> 51:01.162
Do you suppose God
intended to eat Isaac?

51:02.037 --> 51:05.583
That's why he told
Abraham to kill him.

51:06.000 --> 51:07.334
Eat him?

51:07.460 --> 51:09.670
Of course not.

51:09.795 --> 51:13.591
The Angel intervenes in time.

51:15.426 --> 51:17.678
Not always.

51:23.976 --> 51:26.937
I have to know about Mischa.

51:30.191 --> 51:32.276
I can see their faces
in my dreams,

51:32.401 --> 51:36.906
but I can't remember what they called
each other with their bloody mouths.

51:38.824 --> 51:42.161
I would give anything
to remember.

51:45.331 --> 51:47.458
Hannibal...

51:47.666 --> 51:52.546
Memory is a knife.
It can hurt you.

52:16.153 --> 52:18.864
I want to stay
here with you.

52:19.448 --> 52:23.160
No.
You must stay at school.

52:43.305 --> 52:45.975
Louis,
I need you to remember.

52:46.100 --> 52:49.895
Who told the Nazis
where the children were hidden?

52:50.020 --> 52:52.523
You must remember.

52:53.732 --> 52:57.361
I can't bear to think
about it.

52:57.862 --> 53:00.239
This will help you remember.

53:02.074 --> 53:04.034
Hannibal Lecter.

53:04.160 --> 53:06.537
What are you doing here?

53:06.662 --> 53:08.164
The body.

53:08.289 --> 53:10.458
I'm a medical student now.

53:10.583 --> 53:13.627
Yes, I know.
I have followed your progress.

53:13.752 --> 53:16.881
You repeat nothing
you hear in this room.

53:20.468 --> 53:22.261
Please, Louis...

53:22.386 --> 53:24.805
Klaus Barbie shipped
the children to Auschwitz.

53:24.930 --> 53:26.974
Who told him where the
children were hidden?

53:27.099 --> 53:29.560
Did you tell him?

53:31.604 --> 53:37.109
When they broke my fingers,
I gave them Pardou.

53:38.778 --> 53:43.032
Pardou knew where
the children were hidden.

53:46.035 --> 53:49.163
He's mayor of Belleville now.

53:51.832 --> 53:53.042
Thank you, Louis.

53:53.167 --> 53:54.502
Inspector.

53:54.627 --> 53:55.961
Yes?

53:56.086 --> 53:59.089
Where were the police?

54:16.273 --> 54:20.653
No, no, no.
Please, please.

54:37.837 --> 54:40.631
You knew at once
what Louis wanted, didn't you?

54:40.756 --> 54:44.510
His crucifix to remain with
his brain, not his heart.

54:44.635 --> 54:48.681
He answered your question,
but you didn't answer his.

54:48.806 --> 54:54.103
Where were the police when the Nazis
threw the children into the trucks?

56:29.406 --> 56:31.951
Hannibal!

56:47.675 --> 56:50.052
Come and play.

56:50.761 --> 56:53.389
One little cheek.

56:54.807 --> 56:56.600
Two little cheeks.

56:56.725 --> 56:58.769
Cough.

57:00.438 --> 57:02.189
She has pneumonia.

57:02.314 --> 57:04.650
Let's take her.

57:05.151 --> 57:07.945
She's going to die anyway.

57:21.417 --> 57:23.878
Hannibal!

57:37.558 --> 57:39.685
Come on!

57:39.852 --> 57:43.230
- Get out!
- Grutas. wait!

57:43.814 --> 57:45.900
The dog tags.

57:46.358 --> 57:47.693
Come on!

57:47.818 --> 57:51.655
Pot watcher!
Hurry!

01:00:00.242 --> 01:00:02.203
Passport.

01:00:15.966 --> 01:00:19.136
- Student?
- Yes.

01:00:21.639 --> 01:00:24.391
You need a new photograph.

01:00:39.115 --> 01:00:40.991
Da.

01:00:49.125 --> 01:00:51.085
Night report.

01:00:51.627 --> 01:00:54.380
Entry visas for Kaunas.

01:01:15.067 --> 01:01:17.236
Lecter.

01:01:54.899 --> 01:01:57.443
The lodge.

01:04:25.883 --> 01:04:28.552
"Kolnas."

01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:31.764
"Grutas."

01:04:51.826 --> 01:04:54.328
Mischa.

01:05:12.096 --> 01:05:14.515
Herr Dortlich...

01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:19.645
On behalf of myself
and my late family,

01:05:19.770 --> 01:05:22.940
I thank you for coming.

01:05:23.399 --> 01:05:26.444
Do you remember the bathtub
bubbling on the stove?

01:05:26.569 --> 01:05:31.198
She was dead anyway,
I swear she was.

01:05:41.876 --> 01:05:45.588
So much mayonnaise,
Herr Dortlich.

01:06:06.484 --> 01:06:08.152
Where are the others?

01:06:08.277 --> 01:06:11.697
I don't know.

01:06:30.090 --> 01:06:33.344
Yes, I know where one of them is,
Grentz. I know Grentz.

01:06:33.469 --> 01:06:34.428
Grentz?

01:06:34.553 --> 01:06:37.723
In Canada. He got out on the
refugee boat from Bremerhaven.

01:06:37.848 --> 01:06:39.350
What did he look like?

01:06:39.475 --> 01:06:41.310
Swarthy.

01:06:41.435 --> 01:06:44.021
They wouldn't have let
him in the SS!

01:06:44.146 --> 01:06:46.816
Oh, yes, of course.

01:06:46.941 --> 01:06:49.693
He's the one that
always provided the bowl.

01:06:49.819 --> 01:06:52.071
What about Milko?

01:06:52.196 --> 01:06:54.865
All dead, all dead.

01:06:54.990 --> 01:06:56.659
In the war.

01:06:56.784 --> 01:06:59.662
I remember his singing.

01:07:01.288 --> 01:07:05.543
And now, your leader Grutas.

01:07:06.752 --> 01:07:10.172
I don't know, I don't know,
I don't know, please!

01:07:10.297 --> 01:07:15.302
Please let me go, and I will
testify against Grentz.

01:07:25.604 --> 01:07:30.526
Do you remember "Das MÃ¤nnlein
im Walde," Herr Dortlich?

01:07:35.156 --> 01:07:38.242
Mischa loved that song.

01:07:39.243 --> 01:07:41.662
Let's sing for Mischa.

01:07:55.134 --> 01:07:56.635
You're not singing.

01:07:56.760 --> 01:07:59.597
Sing for slack, Herr Dortlich.

01:07:59.722 --> 01:08:02.475
Sag...

01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:16.947
It's Kolnas!
Kolnas deals with him!

01:08:20.033 --> 01:08:22.620
Deals with him.

01:08:33.631 --> 01:08:36.133
And where is Kolnas?

01:08:38.469 --> 01:08:40.930
Fontainebleau.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:13.462
Purpurroten MÃ¤ntelein, indeed.

01:10:19.820 --> 01:10:25.201
Picked some wild mushrooms
and made a brochette.

01:10:26.869 --> 01:10:30.915
Mushrooms and cheeks.

01:11:19.755 --> 01:11:22.299
Where have you been?

01:11:28.013 --> 01:11:32.351
You smell of smoke and blood.

01:11:47.867 --> 01:11:50.494
Where did you go?

01:11:52.455 --> 01:11:54.707
I found them.

01:11:56.542 --> 01:11:59.295
The men who killed Mischa.

01:11:59.712 --> 01:12:03.132
I have the names.

01:12:04.300 --> 01:12:07.094
They're here in France.

01:12:08.596 --> 01:12:10.431
Where?

01:12:11.682 --> 01:12:13.893
Fontainebleau.

01:12:33.829 --> 01:12:36.081
Ortolans.

01:12:38.083 --> 01:12:42.755
He nets them on their way
to Africa and serves them for lunch.

01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:46.175
They're like us...
they smell the others cooking,

01:12:46.300 --> 01:12:49.637
and still they try to sing.

01:12:58.354 --> 01:13:01.190
Kolnas is using
the name of "Kleber".

01:13:01.315 --> 01:13:03.567
It's on the license.

01:13:04.151 --> 01:13:08.239
Monsieur Kleber,
residing Rue Juliana.

01:13:11.826 --> 01:13:13.953
Morning, how are you?

01:13:14.495 --> 01:13:16.455
Oh, look.

01:13:16.580 --> 01:13:18.749
Here he is.

01:13:18.874 --> 01:13:22.837
Come by on his way to church
to check the till.

01:13:23.921 --> 01:13:27.967
How neat he is,
and plump, this...

01:13:28.843 --> 01:13:31.178
...war criminal.

01:14:14.472 --> 01:14:17.600
Do you know that song?

01:14:25.566 --> 01:14:27.109
Where's Natalya?

01:14:27.234 --> 01:14:29.612
Where is she?

01:14:30.070 --> 01:14:32.490
She's always wandering off.

01:14:32.615 --> 01:14:35.367
Come, come.
Come!

01:14:36.285 --> 01:14:38.829
We need to go to church.

01:14:39.997 --> 01:14:43.501
Hannibal, he has children.

01:14:44.168 --> 01:14:47.421
She's wearing
Mischa's bracelet.

01:14:49.340 --> 01:14:53.135
Choose your offering
for the church.

01:14:54.303 --> 01:14:57.431
Good.
Put it in your pocket?

01:14:57.556 --> 01:14:59.850
Ah, the shiny one.

01:14:59.975 --> 01:15:03.229
We'll put it safe in...

01:15:09.193 --> 01:15:11.612
What is it?

01:15:56.782 --> 01:15:59.702
- Evening.
- They're waiting for you down below.

01:15:59.827 --> 01:16:02.913
I called my
Soviet friends.

01:16:04.081 --> 01:16:06.584
Dortlich's dog tag
was in his mouth.

01:16:06.709 --> 01:16:09.962
That means that he has
all of our dog tags

01:16:10.087 --> 01:16:13.466
- and the pot watcher's inventory.
- No, no.

01:16:13.591 --> 01:16:17.803
Dortlich searched
those ruins before?

01:16:17.928 --> 01:16:20.848
Grutas told him to do it.

01:16:20.973 --> 01:16:24.059
Poked around with his picnic fork,
the lazy bastard.

01:16:24.185 --> 01:16:25.853
Who is he?

01:16:25.978 --> 01:16:29.023
Who is he, this...
poisoned little boy

01:16:29.148 --> 01:16:31.484
who killed Dortlich?

01:16:31.609 --> 01:16:33.652
He's a Paris schoolboy.

01:16:33.778 --> 01:16:36.489
They say that there is
a passport photograph,

01:16:36.614 --> 01:16:38.032
but they don't have it yet.

01:16:38.157 --> 01:16:40.075
What's his name?

01:16:42.369 --> 01:16:44.455
Hannibal Lector.

01:16:50.127 --> 01:16:52.004
You know him?

01:16:53.255 --> 01:16:54.840
So do you.

01:16:54.965 --> 01:17:01.472
We... we had dinner with him
during the war.

01:17:03.516 --> 01:17:07.436
Go back to your
restaurant, Kolnas.

01:17:13.359 --> 01:17:16.987
Bring me a covered dish
next time.

01:17:22.576 --> 01:17:25.121
Where the hell is Dieter?

01:17:25.913 --> 01:17:27.039
Dieter!

01:17:27.164 --> 01:17:32.378
You bruise their face, you split
their lip, the money goes down.

01:17:32.503 --> 01:17:34.338
Come here.

01:17:36.006 --> 01:17:38.092
And that one...

01:17:38.217 --> 01:17:40.594
that one is mine,
for now.

01:17:40.719 --> 01:17:42.763
I didn't do it!

01:17:42.888 --> 01:17:45.224
Milko, I want you
to go to Paris.

01:17:45.349 --> 01:17:49.061
Kolnas found me
a BÃ¶sendorfer piano, the best.

01:17:49.186 --> 01:17:51.272
Oh, and...

01:17:51.397 --> 01:17:52.940
find the boy.

01:17:53.065 --> 01:17:55.025
Lector.

01:17:55.151 --> 01:17:58.362
You know what to do
with him.

01:18:10.416 --> 01:18:12.418
Thanks.

01:18:43.032 --> 01:18:44.784
Inspector Popil.

01:18:44.909 --> 01:18:46.744
Please come in.

01:18:46.869 --> 01:18:51.081
This is...
not a social call.

01:18:56.253 --> 01:18:58.547
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

01:18:58.672 --> 01:19:00.966
At medical school,
I think.

01:19:01.091 --> 01:19:03.677
Did you ever see
this man?

01:19:09.975 --> 01:19:11.811
No.

01:19:13.562 --> 01:19:15.564
His name's Dortlich.

01:19:15.689 --> 01:19:17.733
He's a war criminal.

01:19:17.858 --> 01:19:21.237
He was found near
the castle Hannibal came from.

01:19:21.362 --> 01:19:24.365
Dortlich had some
ugly friends.

01:19:25.116 --> 01:19:27.952
I want to know
where they are.

01:19:28.285 --> 01:19:30.454
Hannibal may know.

01:19:49.682 --> 01:19:52.101
Don't cut yourself.

01:20:00.359 --> 01:20:02.653
I know about you.

01:20:03.070 --> 01:20:06.031
I know you lost
your family, everything,

01:20:06.157 --> 01:20:09.535
when the bomb fell
on Hiroshima.

01:20:14.665 --> 01:20:16.208
Yes.

01:20:16.333 --> 01:20:20.629
You protect Hannibal
because he lost everything, too?

01:20:21.380 --> 01:20:24.008
That is your bond with him?

01:20:25.092 --> 01:20:30.598
Do you see your family
in your dreams, Inspector?

01:20:31.891 --> 01:20:34.018
Yes.

01:20:35.352 --> 01:20:37.521
So do I.

01:20:38.481 --> 01:20:41.233
So does he.

01:20:50.034 --> 01:20:52.912
If your pet snake
strikes in France,

01:20:53.037 --> 01:20:58.209
I will have to seize him, and
he will die under the guillotine.

01:24:47.813 --> 01:24:49.690
Sorry.

01:25:05.748 --> 01:25:08.292
It was Grutas who
sent you to kill me.

01:25:08.417 --> 01:25:11.378
No, not to kill.

01:25:13.005 --> 01:25:14.965
To give you money.

01:25:15.090 --> 01:25:18.302
Let me give it to you.

01:25:27.645 --> 01:25:29.313
No!

01:25:29.438 --> 01:25:31.565
No!

01:25:31.690 --> 01:25:34.610
No!

01:25:52.670 --> 01:25:55.172
- You killed so many, Milko.
- No!

01:25:55.297 --> 01:25:59.009
Many more than these.

01:25:59.802 --> 01:26:03.347
Do you feel them
in the tank around you?

01:26:08.436 --> 01:26:10.563
We ate...

01:26:11.313 --> 01:26:15.234
...we ate 12.

01:26:17.194 --> 01:26:19.363
Grutas was very quick.

01:26:19.488 --> 01:26:21.991
She felt nothing!

01:26:22.324 --> 01:26:25.411
So, Grutas has a house.

01:26:25.536 --> 01:26:27.329
Where?

01:26:36.881 --> 01:26:39.675
I have difficulty
hearing you.

01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:43.220
He has a house...

01:26:46.724 --> 01:26:47.975
No!

01:26:48.100 --> 01:26:49.685
All right, all right.

01:26:49.810 --> 01:26:53.439
Milly-la-Foret.

01:26:57.067 --> 01:26:59.278
No, no, no!

01:26:59.403 --> 01:27:02.740
She felt nothing.

01:27:45.324 --> 01:27:48.035
No, please!

01:27:48.369 --> 01:27:50.287
No!

01:27:57.336 --> 01:27:59.547
Oh, Inspector Popil.

01:27:59.672 --> 01:28:02.591
What a surprise.

01:28:08.472 --> 01:28:10.808
Found in your room.

01:28:12.309 --> 01:28:15.020
If you kill in France...

01:28:15.146 --> 01:28:18.732
I will see your head
in a bucket.

01:28:19.692 --> 01:28:22.903
Do you mind if I work
while we talk?

01:28:24.697 --> 01:28:29.660
You killed Dortlich in the woods
where your family died.

01:28:30.995 --> 01:28:33.205
His face had been eaten.

01:28:33.330 --> 01:28:35.249
I would suspect the ravens.

01:28:35.374 --> 01:28:38.752
Ravens who made
a shish kebab?

01:28:40.004 --> 01:28:42.173
Cannibalism.

01:28:43.632 --> 01:28:46.385
It happened on the
eastern front.

01:28:46.510 --> 01:28:50.347
But you know that, don't you?
You were there.

01:28:54.143 --> 01:28:56.645
This is not the face
of your subject.

01:28:56.771 --> 01:29:00.775
This is the face of Vladis Grutas,
like the pictures in your room.

01:29:00.900 --> 01:29:03.194
Did you kill him, too?

01:29:05.029 --> 01:29:06.197
No, I didn't.

01:29:06.322 --> 01:29:09.158
Have you found him?

01:29:10.075 --> 01:29:14.371
If I found him, I give you my word
I would bring him to your attention.

01:29:14.497 --> 01:29:16.999
Don't fool with me.

01:29:18.125 --> 01:29:21.587
Did you know he sawed off
the head of the rabbi at Kaunas?

01:29:21.712 --> 01:29:24.048
He shot gypsy children
in the woods.

01:29:24.173 --> 01:29:25.800
He walked free at Nuremberg

01:29:25.925 --> 01:29:29.887
because a witness got
acid poured down her throat.

01:29:32.181 --> 01:29:33.808
I'll need your deposition.

01:29:33.933 --> 01:29:36.268
Come with me.

01:29:45.236 --> 01:29:47.321
Let's begin.

01:29:54.120 --> 01:29:56.247
Put it down...

01:29:56.789 --> 01:29:58.290
...or I'll shoot her.

01:29:58.415 --> 01:30:01.836
Grutas has
the eyes of an arctic wolf.

01:30:01.961 --> 01:30:07.383
He knew at once to threaten Mischa
to make me put down the spear.

01:30:08.134 --> 01:30:09.802
At first...

01:30:09.927 --> 01:30:13.264
they needed us for cover
in case troops found them.

01:30:13.389 --> 01:30:15.641
Later...

01:30:15.766 --> 01:30:18.227
they crowded around...

01:30:18.352 --> 01:30:21.647
feeling our cheeks and arms.

01:30:26.277 --> 01:30:29.071
Hold her head still.
Hold her head still!

01:30:29.196 --> 01:30:30.614
Mischa!

01:30:30.739 --> 01:30:31.824
Hold it still.

01:30:31.949 --> 01:30:34.910
Not in here, boss.
Not in here.

01:30:42.126 --> 01:30:45.212
Hannibal!

01:31:13.199 --> 01:31:14.825
I promised Mischa.

01:31:14.950 --> 01:31:18.537
Promised to make them
pay a pound of flesh?

01:31:18.662 --> 01:31:21.749
To pay skin for skin?

01:31:23.334 --> 01:31:25.252
If they had killed you...

01:31:25.377 --> 01:31:27.797
who would punish them then?

01:31:28.005 --> 01:31:32.885
The answer is "me."
I will.

01:31:35.721 --> 01:31:38.015
If you swear to share
what you know with me...

01:31:38.140 --> 01:31:40.726
then I will let you go.

01:31:41.268 --> 01:31:44.105
I swear.

01:31:44.688 --> 01:31:47.024
Jacques...

01:31:54.657 --> 01:31:57.243
He knows something.

01:31:59.411 --> 01:32:03.207
He'll lead us to Grutas,
then we'll arrest him.

01:32:04.583 --> 01:32:07.086
The court has to
declare him insane.

01:32:07.211 --> 01:32:11.590
Then in the asylum, the doctors
can study him and find out what he is.

01:32:11.715 --> 01:32:16.137
The little-boy-Hannibal
died in 1944 out in that snow.

01:32:19.140 --> 01:32:22.768
His heart died with Mischa.

01:32:22.893 --> 01:32:25.938
What he is now...

01:32:26.063 --> 01:32:29.108
there's no word for it...

01:32:29.733 --> 01:32:33.154
...except "monster".

01:33:11.150 --> 01:33:14.695
Give these men
to the police.

01:33:14.820 --> 01:33:18.282
It's Kolnas's children,
isn't it?

01:33:18.407 --> 01:33:21.076
No.

01:33:36.675 --> 01:33:39.220
Promise me.

01:33:46.185 --> 01:33:48.521
Hannibal!

01:33:49.021 --> 01:33:51.023
I can't.

01:33:54.318 --> 01:33:57.947
I can't.
I already promised Mischa.

01:36:42.653 --> 01:36:44.488
Get out.

01:36:46.740 --> 01:36:50.286
Give us your identification.

01:36:53.038 --> 01:36:55.207
Where is Milko?

01:36:55.332 --> 01:36:57.877
I don't know,
and I don't give a damn.

01:36:58.002 --> 01:37:00.421
You paid me
to bring you this piano.

01:37:00.546 --> 01:37:02.923
Get my bike down.

01:37:20.900 --> 01:37:23.819
Don't worry.
I won't hit you again.

01:37:25.070 --> 01:37:27.865
I like you now.

01:37:33.996 --> 01:37:37.082
Maybe I fix your teeth.

01:37:50.262 --> 01:37:52.932
I want steam.

01:37:53.057 --> 01:37:55.518
Turn it up.

01:38:24.797 --> 01:38:27.341
I'm glad you're here.

01:38:28.050 --> 01:38:31.512
I always felt
I owed you something.

01:38:38.811 --> 01:38:41.981
I thought
you would be bigger.

01:38:42.398 --> 01:38:46.318
I put your face
on every bully I ever hurt.

01:38:54.994 --> 01:38:57.121
Kill him.

01:39:25.274 --> 01:39:27.902
Answer me this...

01:39:28.027 --> 01:39:33.199
Would you have fed me to your
little sister because you loved her?

01:39:33.616 --> 01:39:35.201
Yes.

01:39:35.326 --> 01:39:37.828
There.

01:39:37.953 --> 01:39:40.456
There you have it.

01:39:40.581 --> 01:39:42.792
Love!

01:39:43.083 --> 01:39:48.672
I love myself that much, and
I will never apologize to you.

01:39:49.840 --> 01:39:51.801
Cut him.

01:39:52.510 --> 01:39:56.806
Wait! Look at me.

01:39:56.931 --> 01:39:59.725
And it won't hurt so much.

01:40:11.737 --> 01:40:14.156
Bitch!

01:40:21.997 --> 01:40:24.708
Get him! Go!

01:40:27.545 --> 01:40:29.964
- Call Kolnas.
- Okay.

01:41:06.208 --> 01:41:09.920
To continue
our conversation...

01:41:10.045 --> 01:41:16.302
Do you wish to see...
Lady Murasaki... alive?

01:41:17.011 --> 01:41:19.597
Yes.

01:41:28.856 --> 01:41:29.940
Listen to her.

01:41:30.065 --> 01:41:33.527
Speak to your little
fuck boy.

01:41:35.112 --> 01:41:36.822
Listen...

01:41:36.947 --> 01:41:38.741
Listen carefully...

01:41:39.074 --> 01:41:41.327
I offer you a
life for a life.

01:41:41.452 --> 01:41:42.745
Bring me everything
you have...

01:41:42.870 --> 01:41:46.415
the dog tags, pot watcher's little
inventory, every fucking thing!

01:41:46.540 --> 01:41:50.795
- Where?
- Kilometer 36 on the way to Trilbardou.

01:41:50.920 --> 01:41:52.922
There is a telephone kiosk.

01:41:53.047 --> 01:41:55.382
Be there at sunrise
and wait for a call.

01:41:55.508 --> 01:42:01.013
If you are not there, I will
send her cheeks... in the mail!

01:42:01.138 --> 01:42:04.892
A life for a life.

01:42:12.066 --> 01:42:19.406
I know your asshole...
will look just like a violet.

01:42:38.217 --> 01:42:40.719
Take her away.

01:42:41.637 --> 01:42:45.766
Kolnas, bring me a jar.

01:42:46.183 --> 01:42:49.353
Kill him at the
telephone kiosk.

01:42:49.520 --> 01:42:52.398
Bring his balls
to the boat.

01:43:26.474 --> 01:43:28.267
Ready to sail, sir.

01:43:28.392 --> 01:43:31.270
Come on!

01:43:44.450 --> 01:43:48.370
I'm sorry. Your...
room isn't quite ready yet.

01:43:48.496 --> 01:43:50.748
I'll contact room service.

01:43:50.873 --> 01:43:53.000
Please...

01:43:53.125 --> 01:43:55.336
Eva!

01:43:56.295 --> 01:44:01.634
Clean up the treatment room.
Our old guests are leaving.

01:44:01.926 --> 01:44:03.928
We have
a new one checking in.

01:44:06.096 --> 01:44:07.473
Get out.

01:44:07.598 --> 01:44:10.184
See that Dieter cleans them up good
before Achmed sees them.

01:44:10.309 --> 01:44:14.146
Don't bite the women.
Bite Achmed's gold.

01:44:20.444 --> 01:44:23.280
Drive straight through
to Marseille.

01:44:34.375 --> 01:44:38.379
You know what will happen...

01:44:39.213 --> 01:44:43.968
...if you don't give
me some, please.

01:45:20.337 --> 01:45:23.132
Good evening, Herr Kolnas.

01:45:23.257 --> 01:45:26.552
You drink better wine
than you serve.

01:45:26.677 --> 01:45:29.013
I'm calling the police.

01:45:29.930 --> 01:45:33.642
May I get them for you?

01:45:34.894 --> 01:45:36.812
What did I do to you?

01:45:36.937 --> 01:45:40.608
Aside from eating
my sister, nothing.

01:45:40.858 --> 01:45:43.360
Are you wearing your dog tag,
Herr Kolnas?

01:45:43.486 --> 01:45:47.823
Many people look like me. Are you
sure you have the right person?

01:45:47.948 --> 01:45:51.660
I was slave labor
for the Nazis in the war.

01:45:51.786 --> 01:45:54.038
I lost family, too.
I understand.

01:45:54.163 --> 01:45:56.123
Well, to improve
your understanding,

01:45:56.248 --> 01:46:01.045
I went by your home
on the Rue Juliana.

01:46:01.170 --> 01:46:04.048
I went into the
children's room...

01:46:04.173 --> 01:46:08.177
with the sleeping child.

01:46:18.479 --> 01:46:24.610
And... I picked up
something for your oven.

01:46:31.408 --> 01:46:34.411
It's a beef roast, Kolnas.

01:46:34.537 --> 01:46:36.705
Do you see how it feels?

01:46:46.173 --> 01:46:48.134
Lunatic!

01:47:05.860 --> 01:47:08.404
Where is my daughter?

01:47:09.155 --> 01:47:11.490
What did you do to her?

01:47:16.162 --> 01:47:19.206
Your daughter is safe,
Herr Kolnas.

01:47:20.291 --> 01:47:24.253
I'll give her back to you
when you give me Lady Murasaki.

01:47:25.421 --> 01:47:29.341
If I do that,
then I am a dead man.

01:47:29.467 --> 01:47:30.801
No.

01:47:30.926 --> 01:47:34.096
Grutas will be arrested.

01:47:34.221 --> 01:47:36.974
I won't remember your face.

01:47:37.975 --> 01:47:40.269
Help me...

01:47:40.644 --> 01:47:43.939
...or I'll leave the child
to starve.

01:47:45.983 --> 01:47:48.652
Where is Lady Murasaki?

01:47:49.111 --> 01:47:51.572
Grutas has a houseboat.

01:47:51.697 --> 01:47:54.158
A canal boat.
He moves around.

01:47:54.283 --> 01:47:56.619
Where's the boat?

01:48:00.289 --> 01:48:04.835
In the Canal l'Ourcq,
west of Meux.

01:48:07.171 --> 01:48:09.673
Where is my child?

01:48:34.824 --> 01:48:35.741
Hello.

01:48:35.866 --> 01:48:36.826
Hello.

01:48:36.951 --> 01:48:39.036
- Hello, Astrid?
- Yes.

01:48:40.037 --> 01:48:41.997
Look at the children.

01:48:42.331 --> 01:48:44.375
Look at the children.

01:48:44.500 --> 01:48:47.002
- Why?
- Just do it!

01:48:55.386 --> 01:48:56.595
The children are fine.

01:48:56.720 --> 01:48:59.014
They're sleeping.

01:48:59.890 --> 01:49:01.600
Petras?

01:49:01.725 --> 01:49:05.354
Hello? Petras?

01:49:05.646 --> 01:49:07.523
You tricked me.

01:49:07.690 --> 01:49:08.899
No.

01:49:09.024 --> 01:49:11.360
I kept my word.

01:49:12.027 --> 01:49:15.656
I spare your life
for the sake of your children.

01:50:23.891 --> 01:50:26.435
Your boyfriend...

01:50:27.311 --> 01:50:31.148
...ate Dortlich's face.

01:51:19.363 --> 01:51:23.451
Jean, tie her up.
I'll go astern.

01:52:01.906 --> 01:52:03.783
Help!

01:52:08.913 --> 01:52:10.790
Grab it!

01:52:11.707 --> 01:52:14.710
Grab it!

01:52:29.016 --> 01:52:31.268
Hold it!

01:53:11.475 --> 01:53:12.893
No!

01:53:13.018 --> 01:53:15.312
Hannibal!

01:53:24.321 --> 01:53:28.367
Shot in the spine,
my little MÃ¤nnlein.

01:53:38.878 --> 01:53:39.879
Can't feel your legs?

01:53:40.004 --> 01:53:41.714
Too bad.

01:53:41.839 --> 01:53:45.009
You won't feel it
when I cut off your balls.

01:53:47.011 --> 01:53:48.804
A present for you.

01:53:48.929 --> 01:53:50.764
A velvet bag.

01:53:52.349 --> 01:53:54.560
Can you see?

01:53:55.060 --> 01:53:56.896
Good.

01:53:57.772 --> 01:53:58.981
Look at this.

01:53:59.106 --> 01:54:02.943
I can put some color
in her cheeks.

01:55:18.936 --> 01:55:21.230
Where is Grentz?

01:55:22.523 --> 01:55:24.358
If I tell you...

01:55:24.692 --> 01:55:26.610
...will you kill me quickly?

01:55:26.735 --> 01:55:29.029
Yes.

01:55:30.364 --> 01:55:33.242
A village in Canada.

01:55:34.827 --> 01:55:37.163
Near Saskatoon.

01:55:40.124 --> 01:55:42.585
Stop, Hannibal.

01:55:43.169 --> 01:55:44.712
Give him to Popil.

01:55:44.837 --> 01:55:48.883
He ate my sister.

01:55:51.927 --> 01:55:54.138
So did you.

01:55:54.805 --> 01:55:57.266
You ate her, too,

01:55:57.391 --> 01:56:00.478
so why don't you
kill yourself?

01:56:03.355 --> 01:56:04.315
No.

01:56:04.440 --> 01:56:06.776
Pot watcher fed her
to you in a broth.

01:56:06.901 --> 01:56:08.569
Liar.

01:56:08.694 --> 01:56:11.322
You have to... kill...

01:56:11.447 --> 01:56:15.201
...everyone who knows it,
don't you?

01:56:15.326 --> 01:56:18.162
You ate her...

01:56:18.287 --> 01:56:21.248
...half-conscious.

01:56:21.373 --> 01:56:26.462
Your little lips greedy
around the spoon.

01:56:59.286 --> 01:57:02.456
No! Hannibal stop!

01:57:02.581 --> 01:57:05.501
Stop! Stop!

01:57:14.385 --> 01:57:16.846
"M" for Mischa.

01:58:12.109 --> 01:58:13.694
Stop.

01:58:13.819 --> 01:58:16.197
Stop now.

01:58:16.572 --> 01:58:18.574
Forgive them.

01:58:25.790 --> 01:58:27.833
Never.

01:58:39.136 --> 01:58:41.472
I love you.

01:58:51.190 --> 01:58:55.152
What is left in you to love?

01:59:45.744 --> 01:59:46.704
No, none.

01:59:46.829 --> 01:59:48.289
Find me the captain.

01:59:48.414 --> 01:59:51.250
I came as soon as I heard.

01:59:57.381 --> 01:59:59.508
Where is Hannibal?

02:00:00.885 --> 02:00:03.262
Come on.

02:00:09.101 --> 02:00:11.353
Hannibal!

02:00:22.907 --> 02:00:25.576
- Call the fire brigade!
- Yes, Inspector.

02:00:29.580 --> 02:00:32.124
Take some men,
get down there.

02:01:01.112 --> 02:01:03.572
Hannibal.

02:01:28.806 --> 02:01:31.142
Coming.

02:01:55.958 --> 02:01:58.085
Yes?

02:02:00.171 --> 02:02:03.090
I came to collect a head.
