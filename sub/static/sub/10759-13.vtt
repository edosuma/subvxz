WEBVTT

00:07.974 --> 00:11.244
And we'll be right back
after this short news break.

00:11.244 --> 00:12.345
Frasier...
Hmm?

00:12.345 --> 00:14.280
I'm here to give you
an advance tip.

00:14.280 --> 00:15.248
Really?
Hey, Gil.

00:15.248 --> 00:16.716
Roz. I'm about
to review

00:16.716 --> 00:18.184
a divine new
Italian trattoria

00:18.685 --> 00:20.186
I've discovered
called Bella, Bella.

00:20.186 --> 00:21.988
Uh-huh.
I'm alerting you now

00:21.988 --> 00:23.223
because once I review it,

00:23.223 --> 00:25.291
reservations will be
impossible to come by.

00:25.291 --> 00:26.259
Oh, well, thank
you, Gil.

00:26.259 --> 00:27.127
It's always gratifying

00:27.127 --> 00:29.629
to be a few minutes
ahead of a trend.

00:29.629 --> 00:32.031
They make an osso buco
that's so divine

00:32.031 --> 00:35.335
I call it
the veal shank redemption.

00:37.003 --> 00:37.904
Hey, guys.
Oh, Kenny.

00:37.904 --> 00:39.906
Show's going great,
Frasier.

00:39.906 --> 00:41.875
Only one thing missing,
of course.

00:41.875 --> 00:42.876
I know, I know.

00:42.876 --> 00:44.377
A new theme song.

00:44.377 --> 00:46.312
I'm sorry, I just haven't
gotten around to it yet.

00:46.312 --> 00:48.214
Mrs. Delafield's been
hounding me on this.

00:48.214 --> 00:50.216
She really thinks each show
having a theme song

00:50.216 --> 00:52.218
will help hook the listeners.

00:52.218 --> 00:53.186
Gil's got his.

00:53.620 --> 00:55.688
My first choice was
"Food, Glorious Food"

00:55.688 --> 00:57.090
from the show Oliver!

00:57.090 --> 00:58.391
Ooh, that's a perfect match.

00:58.391 --> 01:01.795
Haute cuisine and a chorus
of starving orphans.

01:01.795 --> 01:03.630
But then, a composer friend
of mine

01:03.630 --> 01:05.632
came up with this little ditty
for me.

01:05.632 --> 01:08.134
♪ Whether choosing a wine ♪

01:08.134 --> 01:09.636
♪ Or the best place to dine ♪

01:10.070 --> 01:11.638
♪ It's all a matter of taste ♪

01:11.638 --> 01:12.906
♪ Yes, sir ♪

01:12.906 --> 01:15.909
♪ It's all a matter of taste ♪

01:15.909 --> 01:18.211
Great, huh?

01:18.211 --> 01:19.145
And the nicest thing is

01:19.145 --> 01:20.947
he didn't take a penny for it.

01:20.947 --> 01:23.817
Well, at least he
has a conscience.

01:27.053 --> 01:28.354
You know, Kenny,

01:28.354 --> 01:30.824
I'm sorry for procrastinating
on this thing.

01:30.824 --> 01:33.259
I tell you, I'll get one
as soon as I possibly can.

01:33.259 --> 01:34.227
Well, you better

01:34.227 --> 01:35.662
come up with
something here.

01:35.662 --> 01:37.564
I'm sorry
to be a hard-ass--

01:37.564 --> 01:39.432
it's the part of my job
I hate the most--

01:39.432 --> 01:42.936
but I need this thing
on my desk, Monday-ish.

01:43.470 --> 01:44.938
You know.

01:46.940 --> 01:47.941
You know, Roz...

01:47.941 --> 01:49.943
hearing Gil's little
ditty puts me in mind

01:49.943 --> 01:52.846
that maybe we should just
do an original song.

01:52.846 --> 01:55.215
My new boyfriend, Leon,
is in a band.

01:55.215 --> 01:56.716
He could write one for you.

01:56.716 --> 01:58.718
Actually, I was thinking
of composing it myself.

01:58.718 --> 02:00.120
I'm not without musical ability,
you know.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.856
Could you at least hire Leon
to accompany you?

02:02.856 --> 02:04.791
I take it he's
desperate for work.

02:04.791 --> 02:06.292
Hasn't had a gig
in months.

02:06.292 --> 02:07.794
Music is all he knows.

02:07.794 --> 02:09.562
He's not good
at anything else--

02:09.562 --> 02:10.330
except in bed.

02:10.330 --> 02:12.599
That's what he does best.
Yes.

02:12.599 --> 02:13.833
How long did it take you
to find that out?

02:13.833 --> 02:14.834
Ten seconds,
Frasier.

02:14.834 --> 02:16.836
Oh, longer than usual.

02:21.908 --> 02:23.476
Frasier.
Oh, Niles.

02:23.476 --> 02:24.811
Oh, dear.

02:24.811 --> 02:26.613
We had dinner plans tonight,
didn't we?

02:26.613 --> 02:27.614
Yes. Don't tell me
you're canceling.

02:27.614 --> 02:29.115
Well, I have to.

02:29.115 --> 02:30.583
I have a little project
this evening.

02:30.583 --> 02:32.585
Oh. Does this have to do
with the new theme song

02:32.585 --> 02:34.087
you promised your listeners?

02:34.087 --> 02:34.921
As a matter of fact,
it does.

02:34.921 --> 02:36.222
I've got to have
something by Monday,

02:36.222 --> 02:37.223
and I thought
I'd take advantage

02:37.223 --> 02:38.224
of a nice, quiet
evening at home.

02:38.224 --> 02:42.228
(vacuum cleaner whirring)

02:42.228 --> 02:44.731
Oh...

02:44.731 --> 02:46.032
Daphne!

02:46.032 --> 02:46.833
Daphne,
would you please

02:47.333 --> 02:48.568
turn off that
vacuum cleaner?

02:49.869 --> 02:51.871
It's not a vacuum cleaner.

02:51.871 --> 02:56.142
It's the Dirt Scourge 2000,
a total cleansing system.

02:57.210 --> 02:58.411
Is it new?

02:58.411 --> 02:59.846
Yeah. Got it this afternoon.

02:59.846 --> 03:02.348
You see, this water traps
all the dirt particles

03:02.348 --> 03:04.350
instead of recycling
them back into the air.

03:04.350 --> 03:06.319
I got all that just
from Dr. Crane's pillow.

03:06.319 --> 03:09.255
Ew.

03:09.255 --> 03:11.791
I've been begging
you to switch

03:11.791 --> 03:13.626
to a more
abrasive loofah.

03:16.396 --> 03:18.364
No, it would be the
same for anyone.

03:18.364 --> 03:19.866
Dead skin, dust mites...

03:19.866 --> 03:20.867
That's what we're
all sleeping on

03:21.367 --> 03:22.168
only we don't know it.

03:22.168 --> 03:25.338
We do now. Jeez.

03:25.338 --> 03:27.707
This is the chance
I've been waiting for.

03:27.707 --> 03:30.643
(vacuum cleaner whirring)

03:33.146 --> 03:35.882
(water bubbling)

03:37.000 --> 03:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:46.926 --> 03:49.429
Well, apparently,
the Dirt Scourge 2000

03:49.429 --> 03:53.266
is no match for
the dirt pile 1957.

03:53.266 --> 03:54.567
Well, this is going back.

03:54.567 --> 03:57.971
On the commercial, they clean
all the mud off a hippopotamus.

03:59.672 --> 04:01.507
Well, at least now
I can get down to work.

04:01.507 --> 04:03.009
You know, Niles,
I'm sorry again about dinner,

04:03.009 --> 04:04.277
but can I buy you a sherry?

04:04.277 --> 04:05.578
Oh, thank you.

04:05.578 --> 04:08.081
About this theme song
of yours...

04:08.081 --> 04:10.450
why don't you just
use a standard?

04:10.450 --> 04:12.285
Actually, I want
to compose one myself.

04:12.285 --> 04:13.786
You see, I've always had
an affinity for music

04:13.786 --> 04:15.121
and I've often
wondered

04:15.121 --> 04:16.422
what I might achieve

04:16.422 --> 04:19.325
if I just rolled up my sleeves
and gave it a try.

04:19.325 --> 04:21.728
Didn't you write some kind of
musical back in prep school?

04:21.728 --> 04:23.229
Yes, I did, Dad.
Niles was in it.

04:23.229 --> 04:24.230
You know, the whole
school came out

04:24.230 --> 04:25.198
humming my
opening anthem.

04:25.198 --> 04:26.199
They went in humming it.

04:26.699 --> 04:27.667
It was Beethoven's
Ninth Symphony note for note.

04:27.667 --> 04:28.601
It was not.

04:28.601 --> 04:30.069
It absolutely was.
It was not at all.

04:30.069 --> 04:32.505
♪ We are valiant
men of honor ♪

04:32.505 --> 04:34.040
♪ Wrenching, brawling sons... ♪

04:34.040 --> 04:35.541
Well, all right,
all right, all right.

04:35.541 --> 04:37.543
Well, I suppose I may have
borrowed a note or two

04:37.543 --> 04:38.878
as a launching pad.

04:38.878 --> 04:40.647

04:43.516 --> 04:45.918

04:45.918 --> 04:47.420
I'm sorry I'm just teasing.

04:47.420 --> 04:49.422
Actually, it was
a wonderful show.

04:49.422 --> 04:51.357
I was very proud
to be acting in it.

04:51.357 --> 04:52.792
And you know, Niles, you were
wonderful in it as well.

04:52.792 --> 04:54.794
Well, thank you.
I thought so.

04:54.794 --> 04:56.262
I often thought
if I'd kept at it,

04:56.262 --> 04:58.264
I could have been
a professional actor.

04:58.264 --> 04:59.132
Ah, you see?

04:59.132 --> 05:00.967
We all have a road not taken,

05:00.967 --> 05:03.703
some unfinished business
worth exploring.

05:03.703 --> 05:05.505
Yeah, I always wanted
to be a toe dancer,

05:05.505 --> 05:08.007
but a bullet ended my dream.

05:12.578 --> 05:15.548
Well, Frasier, if you
need any help with this,

05:15.548 --> 05:16.549
I'm right here.

05:16.549 --> 05:18.051
Thank you, Niles.

05:18.051 --> 05:19.052
I'd rather handle
the composing chores myself,

05:19.052 --> 05:21.354
but I could use
a sounding board.

05:21.354 --> 05:23.589
Fair enough. Let's put
our heads together.

05:23.589 --> 05:24.991
Figuratively speaking,
of course.

05:24.991 --> 05:26.326
I saw what came out
of your pillow.

05:33.533 --> 05:35.068
(piano plays simple notes)

05:35.068 --> 05:36.502
I think
this new bridge

05:36.502 --> 05:38.404
is the best thing
you've written.

05:38.404 --> 05:40.206
Really?
Oh, absolutely.

05:40.206 --> 05:42.742
♪ Claustrophobia,
nymphomania ♪

05:42.742 --> 05:44.744
♪ He will probe ya ♪

05:44.744 --> 05:45.745
♪ He'll explain t'ya ♪

05:45.745 --> 05:47.714
It's brilliant.

05:47.714 --> 05:49.749
You know, it does
have a Cole Portery,

05:49.749 --> 05:51.250
Stephen Sondheimy
flavor, doesn't it?

05:51.250 --> 05:52.618
Absolutely. Yes.

05:52.618 --> 05:54.520
Sondheimy would have killed
to have written this.

05:54.520 --> 05:56.022
(chuckles)

05:56.022 --> 05:57.523
You know what?
I'm a little nervous.

05:57.523 --> 06:01.294
It just may be a bit
too conventional.

06:01.294 --> 06:03.062
Perhaps instead
of a regular bridge

06:03.062 --> 06:07.066
I could substitute it
with a dramatic monologue

06:07.066 --> 06:10.970
spoken against
a musical background.

06:10.970 --> 06:13.740
I like it.

06:13.740 --> 06:17.043
Of course, I would
have to hire an actor.

06:17.043 --> 06:19.078
Yes, I suppose you could
squander a lot of money

06:19.078 --> 06:20.913
on some so-called
professional.

06:20.913 --> 06:24.250
Someone who doesn't know
a thing about psychiatry.

06:24.250 --> 06:28.020
Who doesn't understand
the whole gestalt.

06:28.020 --> 06:29.655
Well, maybe you could do it.

06:29.655 --> 06:30.390
I think so.

06:30.390 --> 06:31.758
(laughs)

06:31.758 --> 06:33.292
Oh, gosh, Niles.

06:33.292 --> 06:34.293
I will write you a speech

06:34.293 --> 06:36.796
that will challenge your
entire histrionic range.

06:36.796 --> 06:38.264
This is so exciting.

06:38.264 --> 06:39.265
Let's play the chorus again.

06:39.265 --> 06:40.767
MARTIN:
Hey, Fras.

06:40.767 --> 06:42.769
I just got an idea
for your little jingle.

06:42.769 --> 06:45.238
Came to me while I
was brushing my teeth.

06:45.238 --> 06:47.740
♪ What's new? I'm listenin' ♪

06:47.740 --> 06:49.275
♪ Feelin' blue? I'm listenin' ♪

06:49.275 --> 06:51.210
'Cause that's what
you say on your show.

06:51.210 --> 06:53.980
♪ Feelin' sad,
feelin' mad, feelin' glad ♪

06:53.980 --> 06:56.516
♪ Feelin' bad? I'm listenin'. ♪

06:57.283 --> 06:59.085
Bravo.

06:59.085 --> 07:00.853
That's wonderful.
Well, thanks.

07:00.853 --> 07:03.256
You know, it's catchy--
that's what counts in a jingle.

07:03.256 --> 07:04.624
That's very, very nice, Dad.

07:04.624 --> 07:05.591
It's just that, well, you know,

07:05.591 --> 07:07.627
I did promise my listeners
that I'd compose this myself.

07:07.627 --> 07:09.061
It's no fair cheating.

07:09.061 --> 07:10.496
Well, it's not cheating
technically.

07:10.496 --> 07:11.998
Yes, very good, very good,
Dad, but thank you

07:11.998 --> 07:12.999
Off you go.

07:12.999 --> 07:14.500
Okay, all right.

07:16.002 --> 07:17.370
Hey, um...

07:17.370 --> 07:19.772
Frasier, are you sure
you want to modulate here?

07:19.772 --> 07:21.207
That may just complicate things.

07:21.207 --> 07:23.176
Perhaps.

07:23.176 --> 07:25.144
You know, I'm just trying
to make it interesting.

07:25.144 --> 07:28.080
To my ear, there's still
something lacking--

07:28.080 --> 07:30.016
some tiny ingredient
that's missing.

07:30.016 --> 07:32.084
I'm not sure what.

07:32.084 --> 07:35.087
(musicians tuning instruments)

07:35.087 --> 07:36.355
(tapping)

07:36.355 --> 07:38.624
All right, everyone.

07:38.624 --> 07:39.959
Let's try this again.

07:39.959 --> 07:41.294
We still have a few minutes

07:41.294 --> 07:43.296
before the choir gets here.

07:47.967 --> 07:51.804
Well, finally, the choir
has deigned to join us.

07:51.804 --> 07:53.139
Sorry. Our bus broke down.

07:53.139 --> 07:54.640
We had to walk two miles
to get here.

07:54.640 --> 07:56.108
Ah, well, then
I suppose we can

07:56.108 --> 07:57.577
dispense
with the breathing exercises

07:57.577 --> 07:58.878
I was going to recommend.

07:58.878 --> 08:00.246
Please, if you would?

08:00.246 --> 08:02.081
Off you go.

08:02.081 --> 08:05.952
Frasier, did you mean to cut
paragraph five of my monologue?

08:05.952 --> 08:07.753
Gosh, I might have, Niles.

08:07.753 --> 08:08.521
I've just been so busy.

08:08.521 --> 08:09.856
What was the gist?

08:09.856 --> 08:12.758
A lighthearted lampoon of
mental health care abuse.

08:12.758 --> 08:13.726
Ah. Yes, I did.

08:13.726 --> 08:15.728
I was afraid
that some fussbudget

08:15.728 --> 08:18.231
might take offense
at my jape about lobotomies.

08:18.231 --> 08:20.233
Well, I suppose it's
best to play it safe.

08:20.233 --> 08:22.735
Although I did like
the way you indicated

08:22.735 --> 08:24.537
manic depression
with the slide whistle.

08:24.537 --> 08:26.305
(chuckles)

08:28.040 --> 08:30.676
Do we really have to
use so many musicians?

08:30.676 --> 08:32.245
For the sound I want, yes.

08:32.245 --> 08:34.480
Whatever happened to the
concept of "less is more"?

08:34.480 --> 08:35.847
Ah, but if less is more,

08:35.847 --> 08:38.317
then just think how much more
more will be.

08:40.186 --> 08:41.087
You may be seated.

08:41.087 --> 08:42.421
Ladies and gentlemen,

08:42.421 --> 08:44.724
if I may have
your attention, please.

08:44.724 --> 08:49.161
I'd like to take a few minutes
to explain my artistic vision.

08:49.161 --> 08:50.563
Take as long as you want--

08:50.563 --> 08:52.331
we're all on the clock.

08:52.331 --> 08:53.599
Point well-taken.

08:53.599 --> 08:55.001
Moving right along, then.

08:55.001 --> 08:56.435
Frasier, I'm sorry we're late.

08:56.435 --> 08:57.937
We got stuck in traffic.

08:57.937 --> 08:58.938
Some stupid bus broke down.

08:58.938 --> 09:01.240
This is Leon.

09:01.240 --> 09:03.075
Ah. Hello, Leon.
Hey, Dr. Crane.

09:03.075 --> 09:03.943
Lovely to meet you.

09:03.943 --> 09:05.278
Listen, why don't
you help yourself

09:05.278 --> 09:06.779
to the refreshment
table there.

09:06.779 --> 09:08.281
I've got to have a
few words with Roz.

09:08.281 --> 09:09.715
Roz, we've
got a problem.

09:09.715 --> 09:12.084
In scoring this, I had
to eliminate the guitar part.

09:12.084 --> 09:13.953
Well, put it back.
Well, I can't.

09:13.953 --> 09:15.354
I'm afraid another instrument

09:15.354 --> 09:17.356
might make things
sound cluttered.

09:17.356 --> 09:19.625
Unless, of course,
Leon can play the bagpipe.

09:19.625 --> 09:22.295
Bagpipe?
Yes.

09:22.295 --> 09:24.664
Our show deals with the whole
range of human emotion,

09:24.664 --> 09:25.665
from euphoria to despair,

09:25.665 --> 09:28.167
and nothing says despair
so quickly

09:28.167 --> 09:30.970
as the skirl of a bagpipe.

09:30.970 --> 09:33.339
Nothing says "turn off
the radio" so quickly, either.

09:33.339 --> 09:35.174
Isn't there something else
he can play?

09:35.174 --> 09:38.010
Well, I... yes. Yes.

09:38.010 --> 09:39.445
Actually, our triangle
player called in

09:39.912 --> 09:40.947
with a touch
of tinnitus.

09:40.947 --> 09:42.381
Here we are.

09:42.381 --> 09:44.283
Leon, I have some good news
for you.

09:44.283 --> 09:45.785
I had to eliminate
the guitar part,

09:45.785 --> 09:48.120
but I'm promoting you
to first triangle.

09:48.120 --> 09:49.922
I-I've never played
one of these.

09:49.922 --> 09:51.924
It looks tricky.

09:53.826 --> 09:55.561
I'll work with him.

09:55.561 --> 09:57.897
Off you go.

09:57.897 --> 10:00.900
Well, then, now, people,
um, before we start,

10:00.900 --> 10:04.403
I was wondering, uh,
are there any questions?

10:04.403 --> 10:05.738
Yes, Viola.

10:05.738 --> 10:06.973
My name is Tiffany.

10:06.973 --> 10:09.408
No, no, no. I'm calling you
by your instrument name

10:09.408 --> 10:11.210
so as to avoid confusion.

10:11.210 --> 10:14.480
Oh, well, I have a question
about measure 34.

10:14.480 --> 10:17.350
Aha. I thought you might.

10:17.350 --> 10:18.851
Yes, you see, I've accelerated
the tempo there

10:18.851 --> 10:23.789
in order to depict the yearning
of the superego.

10:25.725 --> 10:27.727
Very perceptive of you
to spot that.

10:27.727 --> 10:30.997
No, I meant, are these
eighth notes or what?

10:32.798 --> 10:34.734
Yes, eighth notes.

10:34.734 --> 10:36.669
Anyone else?

10:36.669 --> 10:37.970
Yes, Timpani?

10:37.970 --> 10:39.705
You just answered my question.

10:39.705 --> 10:42.008
Not Tiffany. Timpani.

10:42.008 --> 10:43.509
What are we rehearsing this for?

10:44.010 --> 10:45.411
Are we going to record it?

10:45.411 --> 10:46.912
Yes. We are waiting
for the final go-ahead

10:46.912 --> 10:47.913
from my station manager,
and then

10:47.913 --> 10:49.348
we will be recording it. Yes.

10:49.348 --> 10:51.584
Anyone else?

10:51.584 --> 10:53.886
Yes... actor.

10:55.321 --> 10:57.356
I'm just wondering
how my monologue

10:57.356 --> 10:59.792
is going to be audible
over all these instruments.

10:59.792 --> 11:02.228
Oh, that's a good point, Niles.

11:02.228 --> 11:03.663
You may be seated.

11:07.633 --> 11:09.402
It is imperative

11:09.402 --> 11:14.173
that everyone play pianissimo
during the spoken portions,

11:14.173 --> 11:15.675
very, very softly.

11:15.675 --> 11:18.110
That applies particularly
to brass and timpani.

11:18.110 --> 11:20.646
Why me?

11:22.148 --> 11:23.549
To the drums, Tiffany.

11:26.318 --> 11:27.687
Oh, Dad, Daphne!

11:27.687 --> 11:29.622
I'm so glad you came.

11:29.622 --> 11:31.524
Well, after all,
it is the world premiere

11:31.524 --> 11:33.292
of your theme song.

11:33.292 --> 11:34.560
I don't have to
search you two

11:34.560 --> 11:36.028
for any hidden recording
devices, do I?

11:36.028 --> 11:38.564
The last thing I need
is some bootleg CDs

11:38.564 --> 11:40.399
flooding the marketplace.

11:40.399 --> 11:42.234
Boy, you really got
everything here.

11:42.234 --> 11:44.236
Oh, it's not a time
for stinting, Dad.

11:44.236 --> 11:46.739
I've got everything from
the African rainstick

11:46.739 --> 11:48.541
to the Javanese tam-tam.

11:48.541 --> 11:51.110
Are the tam-tams the long ones
with the cream in the middle?

11:51.110 --> 11:51.944
Oh, Kenny!

11:51.944 --> 11:53.946
Kenny, I'm so glad
you made it.

11:53.946 --> 11:56.449
Listen, I think you're in
for a bit of surprise.

11:56.449 --> 11:58.217
Well, I got tell you,

11:58.217 --> 12:00.319
I don't surprise easily...
whoa.

12:00.319 --> 12:03.122
Our little ensemble.

12:03.122 --> 12:04.990
So many musicians.

12:04.990 --> 12:06.892
All working on a weekend.

12:06.892 --> 12:07.827
Oh, now, listen.

12:07.827 --> 12:09.261
I realize we are
a bit over budget

12:09.261 --> 12:11.363
I promise, I will pick up
the difference myself.

12:11.363 --> 12:13.799
All right, the time
has come to unveil

12:13.799 --> 12:15.234
my magnum opus.

12:15.234 --> 12:17.570
Just let me do
a little fine-tuning

12:17.570 --> 12:18.904
on the opening fanfare.

12:18.904 --> 12:20.906
Uh, brass,
if you will, please.

12:20.906 --> 12:24.410
In four, the first measure.

12:24.410 --> 12:28.848
(playing fanfare)

12:28.848 --> 12:30.716
(fanfare ends)

12:30.716 --> 12:34.553
Well, you see, that's-that's...
fine as far as it goes,

12:34.553 --> 12:37.923
but this time I want you
to do it with a bit more...

12:37.923 --> 12:40.292
grandeur--

12:40.292 --> 12:45.931
with some majesty
and a soupcon of awe.

12:45.931 --> 12:51.904
(playing fanfare
exactly as before)

12:51.904 --> 12:53.405
There, you see?

12:53.405 --> 12:56.809
That's what good
conducting can do, yes?

12:56.809 --> 12:58.511
All right, everyone,

12:58.511 --> 13:01.347
the time we've been waiting for
is at hand.

13:01.347 --> 13:06.285
And with a...
simple bow of thanks

13:06.285 --> 13:08.621
to the muse Calliope,

13:08.621 --> 13:10.923
let us begin.

13:10.923 --> 13:12.925
And...

Well, Kenny,

15:02.735 --> 15:05.804
what's your reaction?

15:08.574 --> 15:09.842
Wow.

15:09.842 --> 15:12.578
Takes your breath away,
doesn't it?

15:12.578 --> 15:13.879
Wow.

15:13.879 --> 15:14.780
I thought as much,

15:14.780 --> 15:16.782
and in anticipation
of your approval,

15:16.782 --> 15:18.284
I had the forethought

15:18.284 --> 15:19.785
to order in a
little bubbly.

15:19.785 --> 15:21.287
Niles, if you would
help me, please.

15:21.287 --> 15:22.788
(laughing):
You were wonderful!

15:22.788 --> 15:25.291
Thank you. The trombone
frightened me.

15:27.092 --> 15:27.860
Wow.

15:27.860 --> 15:30.362
That was sure something,
wasn't it?

15:30.362 --> 15:31.330
I'll say.

15:31.330 --> 15:35.200
Sort of like Gilbert
and Sullivan-- only frightening.

15:35.200 --> 15:38.437
A little jingle,
that's all we wanted.

15:38.437 --> 15:40.806
Ten seconds to
start the show.

15:40.806 --> 15:43.309
Maybe Frasier
can cut this down.

15:43.309 --> 15:45.811
He gives me harps
and drums and...

15:45.811 --> 15:47.613
people speaking German.

15:47.613 --> 15:49.415
All we wanted was
a simple little jingle.

15:49.415 --> 15:51.784
Probably more like the one
you came up with.

15:51.784 --> 15:53.285
Tell him yours,
Mr. Crane.

15:53.285 --> 15:54.787
No, no, no.
It was nothing.

15:54.787 --> 15:56.288
I can't even remember
how it goes.

16:04.096 --> 16:05.097
Well, all right.

it sets the mood.

16:21.914 --> 16:22.915
It-it says it all.

16:22.915 --> 16:24.917
Did that just pop
into you head?

16:24.917 --> 16:27.219
Hardly.

16:27.219 --> 16:29.021
It was gut-wrenching,

16:29.021 --> 16:32.958
but, you know, it's nice to know
that I made it look easy.

16:32.958 --> 16:36.395
No, no, no. I'm talking
about your dad's little jingle.

16:36.395 --> 16:37.396
Dad's?

16:37.396 --> 16:38.897
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
he just sang it.

16:38.897 --> 16:40.366

of thing we need.

16:40.366 --> 16:41.867
You know, simple, catchy.

16:41.867 --> 16:43.869
You know, we ought
to just use that one.

FRASIER:
No, no, no. Kenny, no.

16:45.237 --> 16:46.605
No, if simple is
what you wanted,

16:46.605 --> 16:48.007
you should've
just said so.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.408
I thought I did.

16:49.408 --> 16:50.676
Obviously not.

16:50.676 --> 16:51.944
Now that I know what you want,

16:51.944 --> 16:52.945
well, there's nothing easier.

16:52.945 --> 16:53.946
Of course I can write simple.

16:54.446 --> 16:56.448
I promise you, it'll be
something far more memorable

16:56.448 --> 16:57.816

17:38.457 --> 17:40.793
"Merrily, merrily."

17:40.793 --> 17:42.694
Well, now, it's getting
kind of late.

17:42.694 --> 17:44.196
Maybe you should call it
a night, huh?

17:44.696 --> 17:45.697
Dad, you heard Kenny.

17:45.697 --> 17:47.199
I have to come up
with something

17:47.199 --> 17:48.667
as simple as yours
by Monday.

17:48.667 --> 17:50.135
By the way, thanks, once again

17:50.135 --> 17:51.603
for completely upstaging me
today.

17:51.603 --> 17:53.572
Oh, come on.
I'm sorry I stole your thunder,

17:53.572 --> 17:55.374
but it's not like I did it
on purpose.

17:55.374 --> 17:56.208
I know, I know.

17:56.208 --> 17:57.676
I'm sorry. It's just...

17:57.676 --> 18:00.712
I don't know why I'm having
such a hard time with this.

18:00.712 --> 18:01.713
Well...

18:01.713 --> 18:03.715
maybe you're just thinking
too much.

18:03.715 --> 18:05.217
You know, look at me--

18:05.217 --> 18:07.219
I go to bathroom,
I'm flossing my teeth

18:07.219 --> 18:08.720
and that song pops
in my head.

18:08.720 --> 18:12.624
Are you suggesting that
I bring out a spool of floss?

18:12.624 --> 18:14.526
Well, it might not be a bad idea

18:15.027 --> 18:16.361
for a couple of reasons.

18:16.361 --> 18:19.064
Frasier, why don't you
just decide

18:19.064 --> 18:20.933
what you want to say
and say it

18:20.933 --> 18:23.435
without a lot of big words
and showing off.

18:23.435 --> 18:26.438
You know, and the tune
should be something simple,

18:26.438 --> 18:27.806
something you can whistle.

18:27.806 --> 18:29.675
I tried whistling that thing
you wrote today,

18:29.675 --> 18:32.678
and I got light-headed.

18:34.012 --> 18:35.347
Of course it might've
been that last doughnut.

18:35.347 --> 18:38.851
I went back for one of those
African rainsticks.

18:41.787 --> 18:45.290
The truth is, Dad, I

18:45.290 --> 18:48.560
I'm not sure I can do simple.

18:48.560 --> 18:50.796
Well, I don't know if you can't
or if you just don't want to.

18:50.796 --> 18:52.731
But some of the best things
in the world

18:52.731 --> 18:54.099
are simple, Fras.

18:54.099 --> 18:55.501
Just like that art gallery
you took me to

18:55.501 --> 18:57.002
a couple months ago.

18:57.002 --> 18:58.003
Do you remember?

18:58.003 --> 18:59.505
You were oohing and aahing

18:59.505 --> 19:02.407
over this painting
of a big, red dot.

19:02.407 --> 19:05.244
Yeah, Dad. But there is a
difference between simple

19:05.244 --> 19:08.046
and deceptively simple.

19:08.046 --> 19:10.315
Well, all I'm saying is
that it's fine to be smart,

19:10.315 --> 19:13.118
but you shouldn't have
to be proving it all the time,

19:13.118 --> 19:13.919
that's all.

19:13.919 --> 19:15.687
You know,
just as an experiment,

19:15.687 --> 19:17.489
tell me what it is
you're trying to say

19:17.489 --> 19:19.825
stripped down to nuts and bolts.

19:21.593 --> 19:23.128
All right, um...

19:23.128 --> 19:26.632
in my first stanza,
I want to represent myself

19:26.632 --> 19:29.635
as the... ombudsman
between the conscious

19:30.102 --> 19:33.038
and subconscious minds
of my listeners.

19:33.038 --> 19:34.439
Ah. Well, there you are.

19:34.940 --> 19:36.441
There's the song right there.

19:36.441 --> 19:38.944
All we need
is a rhyme for "ombudsman,"

19:38.944 --> 19:40.846
and we can go to bed.

19:40.846 --> 19:44.316
I was playing around
with "north woodsman."

19:44.316 --> 19:45.684
(laughing)

19:45.684 --> 19:48.554
Oh, Frasier...

19:48.554 --> 19:50.956
Look, I'm going to tell you
what your show's about:

19:50.956 --> 19:53.425
People have a problem,
they're feeling low,

19:53.425 --> 19:55.360
they call you,
you make them feel better.

19:55.360 --> 19:56.261
Oh, for God's sake, Dad.

19:56.261 --> 19:57.563
Well, that's it,
that's it.

19:57.563 --> 19:59.331
Why don't you just write
about that?

19:59.331 --> 20:00.632
How would that
sound exactly?

20:00.632 --> 20:02.501

a rhyme for "low"?

20:08.006 --> 20:09.007
Okay, smart aleck.

20:09.007 --> 20:10.509
I was just trying to help.

20:10.509 --> 20:11.810
Well, thanks, Dad.

20:11.810 --> 20:13.612
I'm sorry. It's
just not my thing.

20:13.612 --> 20:17.115
Okay, well,
I'm going to bed.

20:17.115 --> 20:19.618
So, if you need
any help tomorrow,

20:19.618 --> 20:21.119

20:21.119 --> 20:23.121
