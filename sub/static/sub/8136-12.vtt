00:26.705 --> 00:28.764
If those bank robbers
think you can ID 'em,

00:28.907 --> 00:30.966
you need a lot more
help than you think.

00:35.480 --> 00:36.469
Michael, look out.

00:39.451 --> 00:41.146
Look, the kid is
a material witness.

00:41.320 --> 00:43.083
If they find him,
they could kill him.

00:45.757 --> 00:47.088
KITT, I need you.

00:50.762 --> 00:52.024
Which way did they go?

00:56.768 --> 00:58.395
Come on.
He can ID us.

01:04.910 --> 01:05.899
Come on.

01:07.045 --> 01:10.071
Michael, my sensors are picking
up someone hidden in the field.

01:10.182 --> 01:11.649
It's Tino.

01:11.817 --> 01:13.512
He's directly in
the path of that machine.

01:35.507 --> 01:37.475
Knight Rider, a shadowy flight

01:37.542 --> 01:39.976
into the dangerous world
of a man

01:40.045 --> 01:42.275
who does not exist.

01:48.553 --> 01:50.521
Michael Knight, a young loner

01:50.589 --> 01:53.217
on a crusade to champion
the cause of the innocent,

01:53.291 --> 01:55.384
the helpless, the powerless,

01:55.460 --> 01:58.657
in a world of criminals
who operate above the law.

03:37.662 --> 03:39.721
Michael, here comes Devon.

03:41.666 --> 03:42.690
Hello, Devon.

03:42.834 --> 03:43.892
Well, Michael.

03:44.736 --> 03:47.466
I was hoping to see you come
out of a formalwear shop.

03:47.539 --> 03:48.733
Don't worry, Devon.

03:48.807 --> 03:49.967
Everything's under control.

03:50.041 --> 03:52.100
KITT and I are
plotting a direct route

03:52.177 --> 03:54.168
to a formalwear shop
even as we speak.

03:54.246 --> 03:58.444
Good. Well, just in case
his route leads astray,

03:58.550 --> 04:00.882
permit me to
show you something.

04:03.555 --> 04:04.954
What is that?

04:05.023 --> 04:06.820
That is what you
will be wearing

04:06.892 --> 04:08.655
if you fail to find
a tuxedo of your own

04:09.127 --> 04:11.391
for the annual
Christmas banquet.

04:11.463 --> 04:12.589
Okay.

04:28.480 --> 04:29.504
Ah-ha.

04:29.614 --> 04:32.208
How are you today, dear?
Merry Christmas, everybody.

04:37.455 --> 04:38.581
Merry Christmas.

04:38.657 --> 04:39.954
Merry Christmas.

04:57.375 --> 04:58.342
You're late.

04:58.410 --> 04:59.604
That's right.
Merry Christmas.

04:59.678 --> 05:02.010
Keep your mouth shut,
or you're dead.

05:05.283 --> 05:07.251
All right,
hold it right there.

05:07.352 --> 05:08.819
Now drop the money.
Drop it.

05:08.887 --> 05:10.286
And the guns.
Come on. Let's go.

05:10.355 --> 05:13.449
Come on. Come on. Move it.
Move it. Let's go. Let's go.

05:14.726 --> 05:16.159
All right,
everybody, down.

05:16.228 --> 05:18.321
You, get over here
against the truck.

05:18.396 --> 05:20.421
Oh, I like your watch.

05:27.172 --> 05:28.605
Hey,
what are you doing?

05:28.673 --> 05:30.072
I've always
wanted a gold watch.

05:30.141 --> 05:31.608
What are you, crazy? Come on.

05:31.676 --> 05:33.405
You can buy a million
of those later.

05:33.912 --> 05:35.402
Get in.
Get in.

05:46.992 --> 05:48.653
I love Christmas.

05:49.394 --> 05:53.023
The lights, trees, music.

05:54.099 --> 05:56.761
The whole spirit of the
season makes me feel great.

05:56.835 --> 05:58.097
It confuses me.

05:58.169 --> 06:01.468
What could a paunchy man in
a red suit possibly have to do

06:01.539 --> 06:03.268
with the birth of
a religious leader?

06:03.341 --> 06:07.175
KITT, Christmas is a time for
giving and a time for love.

06:07.579 --> 06:10.480
And Santa is the greatest
giver of them all.

06:10.582 --> 06:11.776
Speaking of giving,

06:11.883 --> 06:13.680
I'm a bit perplexed
about what to get you.

06:13.785 --> 06:16.754
Being a car, it's rather difficult
to know what's appropriate.

06:16.788 --> 06:18.779
Anything but pajamas,
cheap cologne,

06:18.890 --> 06:20.687
ties, and argyle socks.

06:20.759 --> 06:22.454
Especially argyle socks.

06:22.527 --> 06:23.551
Why those items?

06:23.628 --> 06:25.528
Because my folks
can never think

06:25.664 --> 06:27.564
of anything else to
give me for Christmas.

06:27.632 --> 06:31.159
I have got a lifetime supply
of men's accessories.

06:31.369 --> 06:33.030
You still don't have a tuxedo

06:33.104 --> 06:35.971
and the Foundation Christmas
banquet is in three days.

06:36.041 --> 06:38.009
It's been on my calendar
for months.

06:38.076 --> 06:39.976
Besides, I promised Devon.

06:40.045 --> 06:42.138
You promised Devon
last year, too.

06:42.280 --> 06:44.441
This year,
you'll actually be there.

06:44.549 --> 06:45.846
Because I promised him.

06:45.950 --> 06:47.247
You promised?

06:47.319 --> 06:49.378
Well, one of us has
to be responsible.

06:49.487 --> 06:51.546
Now, about your tux,

06:51.656 --> 06:54.716
I've already located
several formalwear shops.

06:55.427 --> 06:56.689
Thanks, pal.

06:56.761 --> 06:58.820
I'll talk to Santa
about puttin' a little extra

06:58.897 --> 07:00.330
in your stockin' this year.

07:00.398 --> 07:03.595
How about a nice new set of
retreads and some mud flaps?

07:03.668 --> 07:05.033
Very funny.

08:15.206 --> 08:16.366
Ow.

08:16.875 --> 08:18.740
Hey, kid.
Watch where you're going.

08:18.810 --> 08:21.005
Excuse me, mister.
I'm sorry.

08:22.747 --> 08:24.237
Come on, come on,
give me the watch.

08:24.349 --> 08:25.475
What?
The watch.

08:25.583 --> 08:26.641
What are you talking about?

08:26.751 --> 08:27.775
It's mine.
I stole it.

08:27.886 --> 08:29.854
From the bank manager,
which makes it

08:29.921 --> 08:31.855
the one thing that
links us to that robbery.

08:31.923 --> 08:33.754
So let's go, banana-brain.
Give me it.

08:33.892 --> 08:35.756
It's gone.
It's gone.

08:36.828 --> 08:39.227
The kid.
He must have lifted it.

08:39.297 --> 08:41.322
Go get him. Come on.
Come on.

08:57.449 --> 08:59.440
My leg. You broke my leg.

09:00.585 --> 09:01.916
You got to get
me to a hospital.

09:01.986 --> 09:02.953
All right.

09:03.054 --> 09:05.716
Take it easy.
Calm down, it's okay.

09:05.790 --> 09:08.088
I've seen that kid before.
He's one of the gypsies

09:08.159 --> 09:09.148
from the neighborhood.

09:09.227 --> 09:11.218
The Good Samaritan is
taking him to the hospital.

09:11.296 --> 09:12.991
Come on, in there.
You got it.

09:13.064 --> 09:14.190
Hey,
let's forget the kid.

09:14.299 --> 09:16.392
By the time we find him,
we could be out of the state.

09:16.434 --> 09:19.267
The minute he tries to hock that
thing, the cops are gonna nab him.

09:19.337 --> 09:20.326
The he's gonna ID us

09:20.405 --> 09:22.635
and in 24 hours our faces are
going to be coast-to-coast.

09:32.917 --> 09:35.385
KITT, what's the nearest
location to the hospital?

09:35.487 --> 09:37.114
The nearest hospital
is 10 blocks away.

09:37.188 --> 09:38.849
Thanks, pal.

09:56.407 --> 09:57.874
What's the problem?

09:58.009 --> 09:59.499
Those guys hassling you?

10:00.011 --> 10:01.069
No. No.

10:03.581 --> 10:05.845
Yeah. Well, sort of.

10:06.484 --> 10:08.577
Look, I'll make you a deal.

10:08.720 --> 10:10.620
You lose those
creeps and I'll forget

10:10.755 --> 10:12.689
about the lawsuits,
the hospital, everything.

10:12.757 --> 10:14.850
Michael, I don't think
that's a good idea.

10:15.059 --> 10:16.686
Who asked you?

10:16.995 --> 10:18.462
You got a talking car.

10:22.433 --> 10:24.458
Those guys don't seem to
have the Christmas spirit,

10:24.536 --> 10:25.764
do they, KITT?

10:25.837 --> 10:27.600
Not at all, Michael.

10:27.672 --> 10:28.764
All right, buddy.

10:28.840 --> 10:30.273
Let's make like
Donner and Blitzen.

10:45.323 --> 10:46.790
How did you do that?

10:46.858 --> 10:48.917
I got helium in the tires.

10:49.127 --> 10:50.458
Who are those guys,
anyway?

10:50.528 --> 10:51.825
They're Bombers.

10:51.896 --> 10:53.420
They think
they're real tough.

10:53.565 --> 10:55.089
They say
this is their turf.

10:55.166 --> 10:57.464
Then they start hassling me.
I tell them, "Look... "

10:57.535 --> 10:59.696
Michael, before this charade
goes any further,

10:59.771 --> 11:02.035
I think you should know
I find no broken bones,

11:02.106 --> 11:05.507
no abrasions, and no
physical trauma whatsoever.

11:05.577 --> 11:06.839
Who says?

11:06.911 --> 11:08.879
In other words,
this little con artist

11:08.947 --> 11:10.608
is lying through his teeth.

11:10.715 --> 11:12.012
Who are you calling
a liar, man?

11:12.116 --> 11:13.083
You.

11:13.184 --> 11:14.811
In addition to which,
Michael,

11:14.919 --> 11:16.853
perhaps you should
ask about the gold watch,

11:16.921 --> 11:18.946
he has in his right
front pants pocket.

11:19.057 --> 11:20.684
Hey that's
an invasion of privacy.

11:20.758 --> 11:22.487
A gold watch, huh?

11:22.560 --> 11:24.528
Now we're making
some progress.

11:24.596 --> 11:27.064
You didn't happen to steal
that gold watch, did you?

11:28.499 --> 11:31.696
Look, that watch happens to be
a family heirloom.

11:36.307 --> 11:39.208
Michael, I've just monitored
a police band broadcast.

11:39.277 --> 11:41.871
There was a bank robbery
10 blocks from here.

11:41.946 --> 11:43.607
In addition to
a great deal of money,

11:43.715 --> 11:45.205
a gold watch was stolen.

11:45.316 --> 11:46.806
The criminals are
still at large.

11:46.918 --> 11:48.385
Look, let me
out of here, man.

11:48.486 --> 11:50.454
This is kidnapping.
You can't keep me here.

11:50.521 --> 11:52.352
Give me a rundown
on the robbers, KITT.

11:52.423 --> 11:53.913
I didn't rob no bank.

11:54.025 --> 11:55.492
Any bank.

11:56.094 --> 11:58.688
For once, he seems to be
telling some fraction of truth.

11:58.763 --> 12:00.230
Though they were
wearing masks,

12:00.298 --> 12:02.289
witnesses said
the three robbers were older

12:02.367 --> 12:04.301
and bigger than
this little delinquent.

12:04.369 --> 12:06.098
Masks. Yeah.

12:06.237 --> 12:07.966
The dude I lifted
this watch from...

12:13.077 --> 12:14.874
He was unloading
this crazy van

12:14.912 --> 12:16.675
that belonged to
some kind of circus.

12:16.781 --> 12:18.078
And there were three of them.

12:18.182 --> 12:21.379
In that case, we'd better pay a
little visit to the police station.

12:21.486 --> 12:22.885
Man, that's the last thing
I need.

12:22.954 --> 12:24.478
Don't be too sure.

12:24.589 --> 12:26.682
If those bank robbers
think you can ID 'em,

12:26.824 --> 12:28.917
you need a lot more
help than you think.

12:46.678 --> 12:48.873
There has to be something
you can do to protect him.

12:48.946 --> 12:49.935
I wish there was.

12:50.048 --> 12:51.572
Look, the kid is
a material witness.

12:51.683 --> 12:53.583
If they find him,
they could kill him.

12:54.052 --> 12:57.249
A dead witness isn't going to help
you or the DA get a conviction.

12:57.321 --> 12:59.255
I wish we had
the manpower to provide

12:59.390 --> 13:01.358
that kind of protection.
I'm sorry.

13:01.426 --> 13:02.620
So what are you
going to do?

13:02.694 --> 13:04.161
Turn him loose
on the streets?

13:04.228 --> 13:06.423
The kid has a sister.
Maybe he can stay with her.

13:06.497 --> 13:08.397
A kid his age
and his sister aren't going

13:08.466 --> 13:10.559
to be much of a match
for three bank robbers.

13:10.902 --> 13:12.267
I'm sorry.

13:13.705 --> 13:16.037
Piece of cake.
I'm out of here.

13:16.207 --> 13:17.196
Ah.

13:18.109 --> 13:19.701
Hey, wait a minute.

13:21.312 --> 13:22.574
Hey, not so fast.

13:22.714 --> 13:24.375
In case you don't know,
you're a ticket

13:24.549 --> 13:26.210
straight to prison
for those guys.

13:26.317 --> 13:27.909
So? So it's not such a good idea,

13:28.019 --> 13:29.884
to go strollin'
around in broad daylight.

13:29.954 --> 13:31.012
I'm not afraid.

13:31.189 --> 13:32.349
That's what worries me.

13:32.423 --> 13:35.119
I'm a gypsy.
I can take care of myself.

13:35.560 --> 13:37.221
Besides,
I'm not walking.

13:37.295 --> 13:38.523
I told the badge inside

13:38.596 --> 13:40.393
you'd give me
a ride to my sister's.

13:49.107 --> 13:51.166
Hey, which one's
the radio, man?

13:51.242 --> 13:52.675
Would you mind keeping

13:52.744 --> 13:54.302
your grubby little hands
to yourself?

14:14.632 --> 14:16.827
I'm sorry, I can't.

14:16.968 --> 14:19.198
Sorry.
You're always sorry.

14:19.771 --> 14:22.001
Marta, I need $100.

14:22.140 --> 14:24.404
All right, $75.
Just until the weekend.

14:24.475 --> 14:25.601
Look, baby,
it's important...

14:25.676 --> 14:28.270
No. And don't call me "baby. "
That's over.

14:32.517 --> 14:34.485
Oh, Tino,
what's wrong now?

14:34.585 --> 14:37.315
Nothing, Marta. I'm innocent
until proven guilty, all right?

14:37.388 --> 14:39.720
All right.
My name is Michael Knight.

14:39.791 --> 14:41.315
There was a robbery
this morning.

14:41.392 --> 14:42.324
A robbery?

14:42.393 --> 14:43.985
Don't worry,
Tino wasn't involved.

14:44.061 --> 14:46.029
Not directly,
at least.

14:46.197 --> 14:47.994
You see, he, uh,

14:48.166 --> 14:51.465
he found this watch that was
stolen during the robbery.

14:51.669 --> 14:53.796
It's become an important
piece of evidence.

14:53.871 --> 14:55.668
See, like I said,
no big deal.

14:55.807 --> 14:57.638
You're
right about that, kid.

14:57.708 --> 14:58.697
You're no big deal.

14:58.776 --> 14:59.765
Look who's talkin'.

15:01.312 --> 15:02.939
Tino, what am I
going to do with you?

15:03.181 --> 15:05.741
Nothing. I can take care
of myself, okay?

15:05.850 --> 15:07.545
I was with him at
the police station.

15:07.652 --> 15:08.778
The only problem is...

15:08.886 --> 15:10.615
The police station?
Are you a policeman?

15:10.688 --> 15:12.588
No, I'm with
a private organization

15:12.657 --> 15:14.522
called the Foundation for
Law and Government.

15:14.625 --> 15:16.115
The only
problem with Tino is,

15:16.160 --> 15:18.060
the bank robbers
may know who he is.

15:21.933 --> 15:23.195
Good riddance.

15:29.507 --> 15:33.341
Whoa, pull over.
Back up, back up.

15:37.782 --> 15:40.250
Hey, Nick,
Nick, come here.

15:43.321 --> 15:45.619
We're lookin' for somebody.
A kid.

15:45.690 --> 15:48.352
15, 16 years old.
Dark, curly hair.

15:48.426 --> 15:50.553
One of those gypsies.

15:50.628 --> 15:53.062
He, uh,
stole my friend's watch.

15:53.464 --> 15:55.227
Could be
worth some money.

15:55.900 --> 15:57.060
How much?

15:58.536 --> 16:00.003
It's worth
$1,000 to you.

16:02.139 --> 16:03.128
Hey.

16:04.008 --> 16:05.873
We heard you hung out
with those people.

16:06.110 --> 16:07.668
Maybe you heard
something, huh?

16:08.913 --> 16:10.278
$2,500.

16:24.829 --> 16:27.423
I get the feeling he could hide
away for months if he wanted to.

16:27.498 --> 16:28.396
That's Tino.

16:28.466 --> 16:30.400
You can't help him,
even when he's in danger.

16:30.468 --> 16:32.766
Which he is, whether
he believes it or not.

16:32.837 --> 16:34.998
Look, is there someplace
he can go

16:35.072 --> 16:36.767
until the police can
arrest the robbers?

16:36.841 --> 16:39.435
I mean, some place away from
here, with friends or relatives?

16:40.244 --> 16:42.269
Uncle Stephano,
Papa's brother.

16:42.346 --> 16:44.075
He still lives
the gypsy life.

16:44.181 --> 16:45.512
He and his people
are camped out

16:45.616 --> 16:47.106
near Lockett
for the winter.

16:47.218 --> 16:49.482
Ever since Papa died,
Tino's been dreaming

16:49.553 --> 16:51.748
about going to live with him.
Like a gypsy.

16:52.056 --> 16:53.785
Sounds like that
might be the answer.

16:53.925 --> 16:55.688
If we can find Tino.

16:56.160 --> 16:58.924
He's built a shack on a
vacant lot over on Butte.

16:58.996 --> 17:00.293
That's probably
where he is.

17:00.364 --> 17:01.558
Let's check it out.

17:02.934 --> 17:06.700
Michael, you've already done
so much, I hate to ask,

17:07.171 --> 17:09.799
but I can't leave the shop,
not now, during Christmas.

17:09.874 --> 17:12.502
If you could find him,
take him to Stephano's,

17:12.576 --> 17:14.669
I could pay for your gas
and time.

17:15.146 --> 17:16.840
Well, I'm going in that
direction anyway.

17:16.948 --> 17:18.142
I'll drop him off.

17:18.782 --> 17:20.114
No charge.

17:20.384 --> 17:21.714
Thank you.

17:22.185 --> 17:24.211
Consider it
a Christmas present.

17:24.321 --> 17:26.722
And don't worry,
everything is gonna be okay.

17:26.790 --> 17:28.816
He's a good kid,
basically.

17:56.954 --> 18:00.219
Michael, I've been thinking
about gift-giving at Christmas.

18:00.291 --> 18:02.919
Yeah,
it's a great tradition, KITT.

18:03.394 --> 18:05.862
But let's not forget
about gift-getting.

18:05.930 --> 18:08.125
The joy of giving
isn't anything

18:08.199 --> 18:10.190
without someone
doin' the getting.

18:10.968 --> 18:13.198
It's a tough job,
but somebody's got to do it.

18:13.304 --> 18:15.329
Frankly, I think
the whole thing's overdone.

18:15.373 --> 18:18.171
The importance of a gift
is the thought behind it,

18:18.242 --> 18:19.709
not the gift itself.

18:19.777 --> 18:21.244
I couldn't agree more.

18:21.312 --> 18:23.837
Then what one gets doesn't
really matter, does it?

18:23.948 --> 18:26.246
Well, that depends.
I mean, try arguing that point

18:26.417 --> 18:28.749
with a 6-year-old
sitting on Santa's knee.

18:30.654 --> 18:32.451
April. Season's greetings.

18:32.590 --> 18:34.421
Well, thank you, Michael.
Same to you.

18:34.725 --> 18:37.751
I hope you and KITT are
headed back to the Foundation.

18:37.828 --> 18:40.262
Oh, we're heading in
that direction. You bet.

18:41.298 --> 18:43.698
Michael,
just what are you up to?

18:43.834 --> 18:46.598
Nothing.
Or not much, at least.

18:47.905 --> 18:50.465
I ran into a gypsy kid
who's a witness to a robbery.

18:50.541 --> 18:51.633
He and his sister...

18:51.709 --> 18:52.698
His sister?

18:53.878 --> 18:55.539
Yeah, I should have known.

18:56.180 --> 18:58.239
April,
it's not like it sounds.

18:58.349 --> 19:00.214
Michael, now, you know
how seriously

19:00.284 --> 19:02.377
Devon takes the annual
Christmas banquet.

19:02.787 --> 19:04.687
He's seated you
between Lady Pinwall

19:04.755 --> 19:06.245
and the Duchess of Chipstead.

19:06.357 --> 19:08.951
So please remember,
he's counting on you.

19:09.026 --> 19:11.324
Oh, I'll be there.
Sure as Saint Nick.

19:12.329 --> 19:15.560
For your sake,
I hope you are, Saint Nick.

19:48.699 --> 19:49.723
Tino.

19:51.102 --> 19:52.433
Hey, Tino.

20:00.845 --> 20:02.836
Michael, I think we have company.

20:12.490 --> 20:14.185
They got to be inside.
Go for it.

20:14.291 --> 20:15.553
You're sure?
Hit it!

20:17.094 --> 20:18.254
Michael, look out.

20:19.597 --> 20:21.030
KITT, I need you.

20:34.678 --> 20:36.305
Michael. Michael.

20:47.024 --> 20:48.218
Michael.

20:48.659 --> 20:49.990
Michael, are you okay?

20:50.060 --> 20:51.391
I don't know.

20:51.929 --> 20:54.329
It's the first time I ever had
the roof fall in on me.

20:54.398 --> 20:57.561
I'm terribly sorry, Michael,
but he had such a head start.

20:57.635 --> 21:00.798
It's okay, pal.
What did you get on the car?

21:01.138 --> 21:03.902
It's out of scanner range,
but I did run the plates.

21:03.974 --> 21:06.943
Unfortunately, they were stolen
from another car yesterday.

21:07.011 --> 21:08.478
Michael, are you all right?

21:08.612 --> 21:10.079
Yeah, I'm all right.

21:10.781 --> 21:12.544
Except those jokers
are starting to take

21:12.650 --> 21:14.550
some of the thrill
out of Christmas for me.

21:14.952 --> 21:16.442
You finally gettin'
the message?

21:16.554 --> 21:18.112
Those guys mean business.

21:18.222 --> 21:20.281
Why don't you grab
whatever's important to you,

21:20.357 --> 21:22.188
whatever's left in one piece.

21:22.393 --> 21:24.486
You're takin' a trip.

21:27.765 --> 21:28.754
Where?

21:30.134 --> 21:31.795
Uncle Stephano's.

21:32.069 --> 21:33.696
Uncle Stephano's?

21:34.138 --> 21:35.070
Really?

21:35.139 --> 21:36.299
Yeah. Really.

21:36.373 --> 21:39.308
That's great. Thanks.

21:39.376 --> 21:40.604
You got much?

21:40.744 --> 21:42.109
Nah, hardly anything.

21:45.316 --> 21:47.307
Really, Michael,
this is outrageous.

21:47.418 --> 21:48.385
Come on, KITT.

21:48.485 --> 21:49.679
Where's your
Christmas spirit?

21:49.787 --> 21:52.017
Gone. I'd like to
see you deck the halls

21:52.089 --> 21:53.716
if some mud-covered moppet

21:53.791 --> 21:55.691
was filling your
trunk with junk.

21:56.860 --> 21:58.384
Absolutely not.

21:58.462 --> 22:00.726
I must draw
the line somewhere

22:00.798 --> 22:02.629
and that monstrosity is it.

22:02.700 --> 22:03.792
What're you talking about?

22:03.867 --> 22:04.925
This is an art object.

22:05.002 --> 22:08.062
That is a phone,
and I am not a booth.

22:08.138 --> 22:10.231
Open up, it's the last thing
I'm taking.

22:10.307 --> 22:12.366
It's the last thing
you're not taking.

22:12.610 --> 22:15.078
Tell you what,
I'm going to make you a deal.

22:15.179 --> 22:16.407
This is my car.

22:16.447 --> 22:18.278
You're gonna make me
a deal to ride in it?

22:18.382 --> 22:21.749
Sure. You let me drive this
car once we get out of town,

22:21.819 --> 22:23.184
and I'll forget
about the phone.

22:23.254 --> 22:24.482
Deal.

22:24.855 --> 22:27.119
You're sure you want Tino
behind the wheel?

22:27.191 --> 22:28.783
I'm sure
I don't want any more

22:28.859 --> 22:30.383
of his objets d'art
in my trunk.

22:39.336 --> 22:42.396
Your brother's a thief.
See, he steals things.

22:42.606 --> 22:44.130
Now what good's
it going to do,

22:44.208 --> 22:46.335
letting a little thief
hide behind your skirts?

22:46.710 --> 22:48.803
I'm getting tired
of asking her to help.

22:48.946 --> 22:50.675
I think she needs
some encouragement.

22:53.450 --> 22:55.418
I told you guys
to leave her alone.

22:55.486 --> 22:57.477
Yeah, maybe we don't
listen so good.

22:57.655 --> 22:58.713
The kid's split.

22:58.822 --> 23:00.722
I heard somewhere
he's going to his uncle's.

23:00.791 --> 23:02.088
That's not true.

23:02.159 --> 23:03.490
Come on, where's that?

23:05.329 --> 23:07.661
Stephano's got
a caravan of gypsies.

23:08.065 --> 23:10.226
They spend the winter
camped out by Lockett.

23:18.509 --> 23:20.704
A deal's a deal,
pal. Thanks.

23:22.179 --> 23:23.305
How could you?

23:23.380 --> 23:24.847
Now they know
where to find him.

23:36.327 --> 23:37.453
Hey, what's this?

23:37.528 --> 23:39.860
None of your business.
And don't touch.

23:39.930 --> 23:41.488
This is
a chemical analyzer.

23:41.565 --> 23:44.557
You put things in there and the
computer tells you what they are.

23:44.635 --> 23:47.365
Oh, yeah. I could tell you
just by looking at it.

23:47.438 --> 23:49.633
Somehow, I doubt that very...

23:49.707 --> 23:50.969
Don't push that.

23:54.812 --> 23:56.370
Wow!
Did you see that?

23:58.082 --> 23:59.344
Whoo.

23:59.516 --> 24:01.746
That's it, Michael.
I can't tolerate the antics

24:01.919 --> 24:04.217
of this little hellion
a second longer.

24:04.288 --> 24:06.779
You're scared of me, huh?
That's pretty funny.

24:06.890 --> 24:10.189
A boy named David
killed Goliath with one stone.

24:10.394 --> 24:12.555
What? Who's he talking about?

24:12.696 --> 24:14.493
It's from the Bible, Tino.

24:14.631 --> 24:16.531
You've read the Bible,
haven't you?

24:16.700 --> 24:19.669
Sure. But I don't
have to brag about it.

24:21.672 --> 24:24.505
To use this computer, there's a
couple of things you gotta learn.

24:24.575 --> 24:26.304
Like, uh, how to read.

24:26.443 --> 24:28.934
I could handle this baby
with my eyes closed.

24:29.012 --> 24:31.003
When can I drive?
You promised me I could.

24:31.115 --> 24:32.844
You're going back
on your word already.

24:32.950 --> 24:33.882
Michael?

24:33.951 --> 24:34.918
Yeah, KITT?

24:34.985 --> 24:36.145
Allow me.

24:36.253 --> 24:38.517
All right,
whatever you say.

24:46.397 --> 24:48.456
Okay, you can drive,
but you keep

24:48.532 --> 24:50.523
your hands off the dash,
and you go slow.

24:50.601 --> 24:51.761
You got it?
Got it.

24:51.835 --> 24:52.824
All right.

24:57.941 --> 25:00.774
All right,
be careful, huh?

25:13.123 --> 25:14.522
Oh, my goodness.

25:36.713 --> 25:39.705
In case you hadn't noticed,
there's a truck ahead.

25:39.783 --> 25:42.115
No problem. I got it
totally under control.

25:44.321 --> 25:45.481
Allow me.

25:47.691 --> 25:48.658
Whoa.

26:06.710 --> 26:07.972
How did it go?

26:08.045 --> 26:10.536
I've been in faster,
but, uh, not bad.

26:10.647 --> 26:11.705
Not bad.

26:11.815 --> 26:13.009
Jump over.

28:45.402 --> 28:47.233
Look, it's Tino!

28:52.342 --> 28:53.969
Look at them,
real gypsies.

28:54.044 --> 28:55.978
I'm going to go
find Uncle Stephano.

28:56.713 --> 28:58.806
Hey, how's it going?

28:58.915 --> 29:01.315
Thank goodness. Can we go now?

29:01.385 --> 29:02.818
What's the rush?

29:02.886 --> 29:05.855
Michael, you have a tux to
rent and a banquet to attend.

29:06.156 --> 29:08.886
And I still have some Christmas
things to take care of.

29:08.959 --> 29:11.860
Okay, okay.
Give me two minutes.

29:33.316 --> 29:35.181
This is my pal, Michael.

29:35.719 --> 29:37.550
You bring my nephew to me.

29:37.621 --> 29:40.351
From the bottom of
my heart, I thank you.

29:42.492 --> 29:44.551
Well, it's
nice to meet you.

29:44.761 --> 29:47.059
Tino talks about you
like you're the last gypsy

29:47.130 --> 29:48.188
in the whole world.

29:48.265 --> 29:49.527
I am.

29:49.766 --> 29:52.826
And now Tino is here,
where he belongs.

29:53.470 --> 29:55.404
Come, we are about to eat.

29:55.472 --> 29:57.633
You'll be the guest
of honor at my table.

29:57.708 --> 29:59.539
Ah, thanks,
but no, thanks.

29:59.609 --> 30:02.134
You wouldn't believe how
late I am getting to work.

30:02.212 --> 30:05.204
Work,
the curse of the gad jo.

30:06.149 --> 30:07.912
I leave you
to say goodbye.

30:09.019 --> 30:11.010
Well, partner,
here you are.

30:11.354 --> 30:14.187
Safe and sound, on the
road with the gypsies.

30:14.291 --> 30:15.758
Just like
you always wanted.

30:15.859 --> 30:18.157
Yeah, all my life I
wanted to be here.

30:18.228 --> 30:19.286
It's great.

30:19.996 --> 30:21.156
You going to
come visit me?

30:21.231 --> 30:22.926
Yeah, sure.
If I get a chance.

30:23.100 --> 30:24.089
Listen.

30:24.968 --> 30:27.698
You keep your hands off
other people's watches, okay?

30:27.771 --> 30:29.398
And you don't run
down any little kids.

30:29.473 --> 30:30.838
Yeah, right.

30:30.907 --> 30:33.034
See you later.
Be good, okay?

30:33.110 --> 30:34.407
Bye.
Bye-bye.

30:48.925 --> 30:50.358
Bye!

31:40.644 --> 31:43.374
Michael, are you distressed
about leaving Tino?

31:43.446 --> 31:45.175
Yeah, I guess I am.

31:45.282 --> 31:47.216
Until those thieves
are behind bars,

31:47.284 --> 31:49.149
that kid's not going
to be safe anywhere.

31:49.219 --> 31:51.210
I'm sure the police are doing
everything they can

31:51.321 --> 31:52.720
to apprehend them.

31:52.789 --> 31:55.019
Sure.
Maybe that's not enough.

31:55.725 --> 31:57.556
I'm thinking we ought
to give them a hand.

31:57.627 --> 31:59.219
Michael, you are distressed.

31:59.296 --> 32:02.231
Your vital signs
are becoming highly elevated.

32:02.332 --> 32:03.526
Let's hit it.

32:10.140 --> 32:11.801
He doesn't have it on him.

32:11.975 --> 32:14.375
Come on, you little punk.
Where's the watch?

32:14.477 --> 32:15.466
Huh?

32:16.046 --> 32:18.276
Come on,
open your mouth.

32:18.381 --> 32:19.905
Uncle Stephano, help!

32:20.083 --> 32:21.607
Aren't you going to
do nothing?

32:24.087 --> 32:26.317
You think you can
hide behind your uncle?

32:26.389 --> 32:27.822
Come on,
where's that watch?

32:27.958 --> 32:29.425
On your mother's grave.

32:29.492 --> 32:31.221
Maybe he left it
with his sister.

32:31.294 --> 32:32.488
No!

32:33.463 --> 32:34.794
Hmm, that
rang a bell, huh?

32:34.865 --> 32:36.560
I told you,
she don't have it.

32:36.700 --> 32:38.395
I gave it
to the cops.

32:38.468 --> 32:40.561
For your sake,
that better not be true

32:40.637 --> 32:43.037
because without that watch,
you're dead.

33:19.776 --> 33:21.641
I don't like it, KITT.

33:21.811 --> 33:24.336
It's the middle of the day, less
than a week before Christmas,

33:24.414 --> 33:25.847
and Marta's shop's closed?

33:25.949 --> 33:27.610
That is peculiar, Michael.

33:27.717 --> 33:28.911
Yeah.

33:38.929 --> 33:40.863
Listen, uh,
why don't we

33:40.931 --> 33:42.728
have a little dinner,
like, next week?

33:43.633 --> 33:46.101
Hey, Nick?
Where's Marta, Nick?

33:46.169 --> 33:47.431
Why's the shop closed?

33:47.504 --> 33:48.596
What are you asking me for?

33:48.672 --> 33:49.934
She isn't my old lady anymore.

33:50.006 --> 33:52.065
I'm not interested
in your love life,

33:52.142 --> 33:54.838
but for a guy who's generally
broke, you're doing well.

33:54.911 --> 33:57.311
Where'd you get the money
for the new clothes, huh?

33:57.380 --> 33:59.974
Where's Marta?
I want some answers.

34:04.220 --> 34:05.551
How much further?

34:05.622 --> 34:07.920
Michael, I'm going
as fast as I possibly can,

34:07.991 --> 34:09.356
given the circumstances.

34:09.426 --> 34:11.951
Don't give me an explanation.
Give me an ETA.

34:12.027 --> 34:14.223
Approximately 17.4 minutes,
Michael.

34:14.331 --> 34:15.661
There's Marta.

34:24.306 --> 34:26.206
Michael, thank God.

34:28.210 --> 34:29.701
Michael, you've got to
help me.

34:29.779 --> 34:31.770
I talked to Nick.
Now I know all about it.

34:31.880 --> 34:33.348
Come on. Jump in.

35:09.019 --> 35:11.044
They sure don't leave
many clues behind, do they?

35:11.154 --> 35:12.644
They never do.

35:14.724 --> 35:16.021
Hey, KITT.

35:17.927 --> 35:19.758
Got any idea
what this is?

35:19.829 --> 35:21.490
My chemical sensors indicate

35:21.564 --> 35:24.829
a petroleum-based product
of relatively high viscosity.

35:25.035 --> 35:26.866
In English that
means oil, right?

35:26.936 --> 35:29.769
Yes. An inexpensive
commercial grade,

35:29.839 --> 35:31.602
and filthy, I might add.

35:31.741 --> 35:34.266
Looks like one of their cars
has an oil leak.

35:34.811 --> 35:37.041
You think you could
follow a trail of this?

35:37.113 --> 35:39.104
It depends on how
frequent the drops are.

35:39.215 --> 35:41.183
It's certainly worth a try.

35:41.251 --> 35:42.980
Tino was right.
It does talk.

35:43.086 --> 35:44.485
Yeah, it does talk.

35:44.554 --> 35:46.886
And it's got a nose
sharper than a bloodhound.

36:17.253 --> 36:19.619
It must be 150
degrees in here.

36:19.889 --> 36:22.517
I don't feel good.
I think I'm gonna be sick.

36:22.592 --> 36:24.150
Here, kid,
suck up some air.

36:24.227 --> 36:25.922
I need something to drink.

36:25.995 --> 36:27.553
Look, we are not stopping.

36:27.630 --> 36:29.222
I don't think
I'm gonna make it.

36:29.299 --> 36:30.960
I'm sick of listening
to this brat.

36:31.034 --> 36:33.366
I got to get to the bathroom.
I'm not kidding.

36:33.436 --> 36:35.529
Look, just shut up, all right?
Just shut up.

36:35.772 --> 36:37.672
In a more recent development,

36:37.740 --> 36:39.640
the watch recovered by
the police department,

36:39.709 --> 36:41.108
was definitely identified

36:41.177 --> 36:43.611
today as belonging to
Richard P. Henzer,

36:43.680 --> 36:46.547
manager of the bank that
was robbed in broad daylight,

36:46.649 --> 36:49.709
in one of the most daring
armored truck robberies this year.

36:49.819 --> 36:51.184
And now for the weather.

36:53.923 --> 36:55.481
The cops do have the watch.

36:55.558 --> 36:57.458
I heard.
Oh, you heard?

36:59.996 --> 37:02.021
Then what do we need
this pain in the neck for?

37:24.220 --> 37:25.448
It's a private
conversation.

37:25.522 --> 37:27.820
You're going to be real sorry
when I get sick.

37:30.293 --> 37:32.124
Casey, come on.

37:32.262 --> 37:35.322
If we kill this kid, there's
that much more heat on us.

37:35.398 --> 37:37.195
Come on.
He can ID us, all right?

37:37.267 --> 37:38.427
Now without him,

37:38.501 --> 37:40.662
there's no way they
can tie that watch to us.

37:55.418 --> 37:56.442
What happened?

37:56.586 --> 37:58.417
You got the keys.
He must've hot-wired it.

37:58.488 --> 38:00.251
What do we do now?
What do you think?

38:00.323 --> 38:01.915
We steal a car.
Come on.

38:11.301 --> 38:13.428
Get in the back. Get in
the back. Get in the back.

38:28.551 --> 38:30.314
The frequency
of the oil spots,

38:30.386 --> 38:33.048
seems to be growing rather
than diminishing, Michael.

38:33.122 --> 38:36.023
Just keep your nose
to the blacktop, buddy.

38:36.092 --> 38:37.753
And to think some poor animals

38:37.827 --> 38:40.125
are forced to do this
for a living.

39:05.255 --> 39:07.280
Come on! Come on!

39:09.792 --> 39:13.353
Can you believe it?
We're doing all of 25.

39:19.769 --> 39:21.600
Out of all
the cars to take,

39:21.671 --> 39:24.868
we got to nab one
that died 10 years ago, huh?

39:24.941 --> 39:26.909
The rest of them
were locked.

39:26.976 --> 39:29.103
We could catch that
kid faster if we walked,

39:29.178 --> 39:31.271
which is what you
guys are going to do

39:31.381 --> 39:34.441
if I hear another dumb word
out of either one of you.

40:25.068 --> 40:26.797
What do
you think you're doing?

40:26.869 --> 40:28.166
Where's Tino?

40:28.237 --> 40:29.295
Gone.

40:29.372 --> 40:31.340
Gone? What happened?

40:32.075 --> 40:35.067
Some men came.
Policemen.

40:35.144 --> 40:36.771
They said
he stole a watch.

40:36.846 --> 40:38.973
How do you know
they were policemen?

40:39.082 --> 40:40.549
They showed me badges.

40:40.650 --> 40:42.083
He's lying.

40:42.785 --> 40:44.150
You watch your tongue.

40:44.220 --> 40:46.450
Those men weren't policemen,
and you know it.

40:46.522 --> 40:49.082
Now, he trusted you.
He worshipped you.

40:49.325 --> 40:50.724
What did you do,
Stephano, huh?

40:50.860 --> 40:52.259
You sold him down the river?

40:52.328 --> 40:53.795
Take your hands off me,

40:53.863 --> 40:55.694
or I'll break
every bone in your body

40:55.765 --> 40:57.198
and feed you to the dogs.

40:57.266 --> 40:59.097
I'm an honorable man.

40:59.235 --> 41:01.100
The great Stephano,
king of the gypsies.

41:01.237 --> 41:04.434
Liar! I saw them
give you the money.

41:04.741 --> 41:05.901
Shut up, old woman!

41:06.042 --> 41:07.236
I saw them, swine!

41:07.310 --> 41:09.744
You sold your own nephew!

41:09.846 --> 41:11.711
I'll let your own
people deal with you now.

41:11.781 --> 41:13.408
I just want to
know one thing.

41:13.516 --> 41:16.849
Which way did they go?
Which way did they go?

41:18.921 --> 41:21.287
North.
Toward the highway.

42:37.900 --> 42:39.128
There he is.

42:53.950 --> 42:55.281
We'll never find him
in there.

42:55.351 --> 42:56.784
It's too thick.

42:57.854 --> 42:58.821
Yeah?

42:58.921 --> 43:01.321
Well, there's more than one
way to catch that kid. Come on.

43:06.562 --> 43:07.688
Come on,
come on.

43:10.099 --> 43:11.088
Come on.

43:12.835 --> 43:13.995
Come on.

43:38.060 --> 43:40.358
They could be
anywhere by now.

43:40.596 --> 43:42.257
Don't give up yet.

43:42.498 --> 43:43.624
If I know Tino,

43:43.699 --> 43:45.360
he's made it real tough
on 'em.

43:46.569 --> 43:48.093
Look, there's the car.

43:55.211 --> 43:56.735
Michael,
my sensors are picking up

43:56.812 --> 43:58.609
someone hidden in the field.

43:58.714 --> 44:00.011
It's Tino.

44:01.017 --> 44:03.144
He's directly in
the path of that machine.

44:03.619 --> 44:05.280
Let's run some interference.

45:01.844 --> 45:03.106
All right.

45:04.747 --> 45:05.736
Are you okay?

45:05.881 --> 45:07.314
Okay?
We're gypsies.

45:07.450 --> 45:09.008
We know how to take
care of ourselves.

45:09.118 --> 45:10.847
Hey, what's the matter?
It's Christmas.

45:10.953 --> 45:12.853
You got something
against Christmas?

45:13.022 --> 45:14.182
Merry Christmas.

45:27.036 --> 45:28.469
Hey, not so fast.

45:28.604 --> 45:30.299
Carrying the stuff
is only half the job.

45:30.373 --> 45:32.000
Putting it away
comes next.

45:32.074 --> 45:33.905
I'm still not sure
moving in with my sister

45:33.976 --> 45:35.307
is such a great idea.

45:35.378 --> 45:36.709
Tino, look at it this way:

45:36.779 --> 45:38.371
You are now
the man of the family.

45:38.447 --> 45:39.675
Marta needs you.

45:39.782 --> 45:41.044
Yeah, that's right.

45:41.150 --> 45:42.276
That's right.

45:42.451 --> 45:44.942
What will you do with all
that reward money, hotshot?

45:45.054 --> 45:46.316
Well, I've been thinkin'.

45:46.389 --> 45:47.856
You know,
school's for kids and all.

45:47.957 --> 45:51.120
But I think I could do okay with
computers, once I learn to read.

45:51.193 --> 45:52.490
Then I'm gonna
get me a car.

45:52.561 --> 45:54.825
Big one. Fuel injection,
four on the floor,

45:54.897 --> 45:56.296
AM/FM cassette.

45:56.365 --> 45:58.526
No. That's not going
to happen for years.

45:58.601 --> 46:01.536
See? I told you this
wasn't such a great idea.

46:01.671 --> 46:04.105
Thank you for everything,
Michael. Without you...

46:04.173 --> 46:07.142
That's okay. It was Tino
who saved my neck.

46:07.209 --> 46:08.198
See you later, partner.

46:08.277 --> 46:10.541
Yeah. Listen, if you
ever get stuck again...

46:10.613 --> 46:12.240
You'll be
the first to know.

46:13.549 --> 46:15.949
Hey, you're
all right for a car.

46:16.185 --> 46:17.584
Thank you.
And, Tino.

46:17.653 --> 46:18.620
Yeah?

46:18.688 --> 46:20.246
Merry Christmas.

46:20.356 --> 46:21.584
You, too.

46:22.358 --> 46:23.416
Straight ahead, huh?

46:23.492 --> 46:24.516
Right.
Right.

46:35.871 --> 46:38.499
What? Tino forget this?

46:38.607 --> 46:41.667
No. April was kind enough
to pick it up for me.

46:41.977 --> 46:45.640
Wait a minute.
Don't tell me. Socks.

46:45.748 --> 46:48.774
Yes, argyle socks,
if you must know.

46:49.051 --> 46:51.645
Well, KITT,
uh, you shouldn't have.

46:52.054 --> 46:54.614
But you're right,
it is the thought that counts.

46:54.690 --> 46:56.419
And I'm sure
Devon will appreciate

46:56.492 --> 46:58.289
the thought behind his socks.

46:58.360 --> 47:01.989
His great-grandfather was
from County Argyle in Scotland.

47:02.064 --> 47:03.691
Oh, these socks
are for Devon?

47:03.766 --> 47:04.698
Of course.

47:04.767 --> 47:07.565
You don't think I'd buy
you argyle socks, do you?

47:07.636 --> 47:08.830
Of course not.
