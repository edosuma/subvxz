01:12.417 --> 01:15.832
Miss G, I wanted to thank you
for lending me the book.

01:17.500 --> 01:19.375
Did you read it?

01:19.500 --> 01:20.749
Yes.

01:20.875 --> 01:23.666
- Did you get caught?
- No.

01:23.792 --> 01:26.083
And anyway, I'm not sure
what all the fuss is about.

01:26.209 --> 01:28.041
I wasn't corrupted.

01:28.709 --> 01:32.041
Good for you.
Let them put that in their pipes.

'I stole milk from breakfast
and made butter in an old cocoa tin.'

03:30.042 --> 03:33.791
But I'm going to share it with the team
so it's only half a sin, really.

03:36.417 --> 03:40.374
And I had lustful thoughts
about the gardener's boy.

03:41.375 --> 03:44.583
But he was only here for the summer
and I never even spoke to him.

03:46.542 --> 03:50.833
Actually, I've had rather
a lot of lustful thoughts.

03:52.042 --> 03:54.208
Do I have to be sorry
for all of them?

03:55.084 --> 03:58.874
One, two, three, four, five...

04:04.334 --> 04:07.541
- Did you tell him?
- Yes.

04:07.667 --> 04:09.499
- Everything?
- Not everything.

04:09.625 --> 04:13.083
- Did you mention the book?
- And get Miss G into trouble?

04:13.209 --> 04:15.958
They don't understand art
and culture.

04:16.084 --> 04:19.248
It's stupid to ban books
that tell you the truth about life.

04:19.375 --> 04:22.209
I don't think it's wrong
to want to know about the real world.

04:23.500 --> 04:26.042
We can't stay pure forever.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.999
Come on, Rosie.

04:31.209 --> 04:32.791
I'm so hungry.

04:35.292 --> 04:37.834
Excuse me. Coming through.

04:37.959 --> 04:39.499
Excuse me.

04:39.625 --> 04:41.708
I said excuse me!

04:44.000 --> 04:45.499
Hello, team.

04:51.292 --> 04:53.541
The new girl is arriving today.

05:03.667 --> 05:05.458
Toast, fag.

05:05.584 --> 05:07.208
Yes, Radfield?

05:08.542 --> 05:10.458
Where's my butter?

05:11.167 --> 05:12.958
On your toast.

05:13.625 --> 05:17.458
Really? Where? Show me.

05:23.334 --> 05:25.541
Oh, how generous of you

05:27.000 --> 05:31.373
It's funny. I go to all the trouble
making butter for the team,

05:31.500 --> 05:34.166
and then I actually
expect to have it on my toast.

05:35.917 --> 05:37.708
Sorry, captain.

05:38.792 --> 05:40.458
Do it again.

05:40.584 --> 05:45.249
From edge to edge. Or I'll have you
on a fork over that fire.

05:48.334 --> 05:52.416
I have to set the standards,
or everything goes to hell.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.415
Quick, she's coming.

05:57.209 --> 06:01.875
We have a new girl coming all the way
from Spain to join your team.

06:04.334 --> 06:07.749
And I want you to welcome her
on her arrival.

06:07.875 --> 06:10.958
I know you are not always pleasant
to new girls,

06:11.084 --> 06:13.498
but I want you to be particularly nice
to this girl

06:13.625 --> 06:15.874
because she's travelling
such a distance,

06:16.000 --> 06:18.958
from another country,
another background.

06:19.875 --> 06:22.290
She's also a Roman Catholic,

06:22.417 --> 06:25.541
but she will attend religious services
with the rest of you.

06:26.375 --> 06:28.374
I want you to be kind.

06:29.459 --> 06:33.624
This girl is an aristocrat.
She is accustomed to the best.

06:38.417 --> 06:40.124
Yes, Miss Nieven.

06:40.959 --> 06:43.332
- Do you all understand?
- Yes, Miss.

06:50.292 --> 06:51.875
Bugger.

06:54.334 --> 06:56.959
Roman Catholics are superstitious
and ignorant.

06:57.084 --> 06:59.499
That's why they have
those ghastly pictures of Christ

06:59.625 --> 07:02.416
bleeding with nails in his hands
and thorns on his head.

07:02.542 --> 07:06.042
Catholic nuns bury their babies
in the backs of convent gardens.

07:06.167 --> 07:10.249
And then they're walled in, standing up.
Can't even sit down to die!

07:19.084 --> 07:22.042
- When's she arriving?
- I don't know and don't want to know.

07:24.042 --> 07:25.833
I hear the Spaniard is a gymnast.

07:25.959 --> 07:29.290
I hardly see the relevance
of cartwheels to what we do.

07:29.417 --> 07:33.458
Miss G allowed it, so I don't want
to hear another word about it.

07:36.042 --> 07:37.373
She's coming.

07:42.959 --> 07:44.958
It's freezing in here!

07:45.084 --> 07:47.374
What does Sunny Nieven do
with your parents' money?

07:48.375 --> 07:50.959
It's not going on the heating,
that's for sure.

07:51.084 --> 07:53.625
Must be throwing it away on drink,
eh, girls?

07:55.292 --> 07:57.624
Fuzzy, why are you hanging
like a sack of spuds?

07:57.750 --> 07:59.333
I lost my bounce, Miss G.

07:59.459 --> 08:01.708
Laurel, give her some bounce.

08:06.375 --> 08:08.541
That's it. Feet together.

08:08.667 --> 08:12.291
Arms straight, eyes forward.

08:12.417 --> 08:16.374
You are sinew and muscle,
cutting through air and water.

08:16.500 --> 08:18.333
With grace, with form,

08:19.125 --> 08:20.625
with agility!

08:22.792 --> 08:24.708
Fuzzy, you can do better than that.

08:24.834 --> 08:28.749
I had seconds of porridge and toast
for breakfast and now I feel a bit queer.

08:28.875 --> 08:30.332
Fuzzy.

08:30.459 --> 08:33.832
Is that the most important thing
in life? Porridge?

08:33.958 --> 08:36.624
- No, Miss G.
- Then what is?

08:39.167 --> 08:41.792
- Think.
- God, Miss G.

08:41.917 --> 08:46.332
- No. Rosie?
- Being kind to all God's creatures?

08:46.459 --> 08:48.499
No, you're missing the point, dear.
Poppy?

08:48.625 --> 08:51.666
- Death.
- In life, Poppy!

08:51.792 --> 08:55.416
- Di?
- Desire, Miss G.

08:55.542 --> 08:57.041
Yes! Thank you, Radfield!

08:58.584 --> 09:01.998
The most important thing in life
is desire.

09:03.334 --> 09:08.499
You can achieve anything you want.
The world is yours for the taking.

09:08.625 --> 09:11.333
Nothing is impossible for you,
my girls.

09:11.459 --> 09:14.208
All you need is to desire it.

09:15.459 --> 09:17.833
- Do you have desire?
- Yes, Miss G.

09:18.542 --> 09:23.416
If you have desire, nothing can stand
in your way. Aim high!

09:34.167 --> 09:38.166
'We shall have a moment
of contemplation.'

09:38.292 --> 09:43.999
I think we should hear Mr Shelley's
thoughts on excessive ambition.

09:44.917 --> 09:46.374
Poppy?

09:47.750 --> 09:50.499
"I met a traveller
from an antique land"

09:50.625 --> 09:56.249
"who said: Two vast and trunkless legs
of stone stand in the desert."

09:57.709 --> 10:02.416
"Near them on the sand, half sunk,
a shatter'd visage lies"

10:02.542 --> 10:07.041
"whose frown and wrinkled lip
and sneer of cold command"

10:07.167 --> 10:11.333
"tell that its sculptor
well those passions read"

10:11.459 --> 10:15.583
"which yet survive,
stamp'd on these lifeless things,"

10:15.709 --> 10:19.082
"the hand that mock'd them
and the heart that fed."

10:20.250 --> 10:24.624
"And on the pedestal
these words appear,"

10:24.750 --> 10:28.624
"'My name is Ozymandias,
king of kings."

10:29.750 --> 10:32.957
"'Look on my works, ye Mighty,
and despair!'"

10:36.042 --> 10:37.667
"Nothing beside remains"

10:37.792 --> 10:41.416
"round the decay
of that colossal wreck"

10:41.542 --> 10:43.749
"boundless and bare."

10:43.875 --> 10:47.041
"The lone and level sands
stretch far away."

11:03.000 --> 11:04.500
Welcome!

11:05.667 --> 11:08.708
It's a pleasure to have you with us, dear.
Did you have a good journey?

11:11.834 --> 11:14.334
Come along. Come along, George.

12:21.792 --> 12:23.292
Come along, dear.

12:39.167 --> 12:41.958
I pray the Lord my soul to keep,
and if I die before I wake...

12:57.875 --> 13:01.667
strong conception
that I do groan withal. Thou art to die.

13:01.792 --> 13:03.833
Then Lord have mercy on me!

13:03.959 --> 13:07.333
- I say, amen!
- And have...

13:10.334 --> 13:12.166
Look, new drip.

13:14.500 --> 13:16.208
With staff.

13:18.959 --> 13:20.916
See, she is a real princess!

13:37.334 --> 13:39.874
Can't stop looking at her.
She's so beautiful.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.958
She's not beautiful.
She's funny looking.

13:43.084 --> 13:46.374
Her face is all lopsided.
Her features are too big.

13:50.250 --> 13:52.374
Poppy, you're prettier.

14:08.084 --> 14:12.041
- I'm Di Radfield. I'm your captain.
- Fiamma Coronna.

14:13.459 --> 14:16.166
You may have five things
on your nightstand.

14:16.292 --> 14:18.166
Then I shall do my very best.

14:22.125 --> 14:23.958
These are the rules.

14:24.084 --> 14:25.833
Five things.

14:26.709 --> 14:27.999
Listen.

14:29.917 --> 14:32.874
It's the sound of the world ending.

14:38.250 --> 14:43.208
During your brief stay with us,
Your Highness, the rules are:

14:43.334 --> 14:46.166
You must do up the top button
of your shirt when wearing your tie,

14:46.292 --> 14:50.374
and you must ask a teacher
or a prefect if you wish to remove it.

14:50.500 --> 14:54.707
You may wear mufti on Sundays
after chapel and before high tea.

14:54.834 --> 14:59.708
And you are allowed five
personal objects on display.

15:00.250 --> 15:01.749
The rules are for everyone.

15:03.292 --> 15:08.166
No exceptions, no favourites, no pets.

15:10.792 --> 15:12.041
What a cow!

15:31.084 --> 15:33.749
Mummy. Mummy.

15:33.875 --> 15:36.459
Mummy! Mummy!

15:44.625 --> 15:47.708
Do you want to wake the others?

15:48.917 --> 15:52.333
There's nothing wrong with you.
Go to sleep.

15:52.459 --> 15:54.458
I thought I heard my mother
calling my name.

15:54.584 --> 15:58.250
I thought she'd come to get me.
Thought I was going home.

16:46.125 --> 16:48.540
Whoever you are, you're late.

16:48.667 --> 16:50.791
- That's Fiamma.
- The aristocrat.

16:52.167 --> 16:53.666
Should I curtsey?

16:55.792 --> 16:57.459
Why are you late, Fiamma?

16:57.584 --> 17:01.041
It is not late.
It is not even seven.

17:02.584 --> 17:04.999
We'll see if you were worth
waiting for, then.

17:37.709 --> 17:39.541
Radfield sets the standard!

17:47.417 --> 17:49.333
What went through your head
as you did that?

17:49.459 --> 17:53.042
- Nothing. My mind went blank.
- Exactly!

17:53.167 --> 17:55.708
This is why we train, girls.

17:55.834 --> 18:00.458
The body learns, it memorises.
Your muscles know how to respond.

18:00.584 --> 18:04.833
Then you release your body
from your mind. It's purely physical.

18:04.959 --> 18:09.415
But there is poetry in such perfection.

18:10.584 --> 18:13.583
Right. Who wants to go next?

18:14.917 --> 18:16.416
Fuzzy.

18:24.875 --> 18:27.041
What's the matter with you, Fuzzy?

18:27.750 --> 18:29.708
Thinking about the boys again?

18:29.834 --> 18:32.624
No, I'm thinking about my dive.

18:32.750 --> 18:34.541
Don't think! Do!

18:49.792 --> 18:51.416
Fuzzy!

19:00.917 --> 19:02.416
Fiamma?

19:04.375 --> 19:07.458
It's too cold to dive.
Too cold to swim.

19:07.584 --> 19:09.958
It's not too cold for my girls.

19:10.084 --> 19:14.624
- This is winter in Spain.
- But this isn't Spain, is it?

19:15.250 --> 19:18.791
What are you afraid of?
Not as good as you look, perhaps?

20:15.792 --> 20:17.999
- Amazing!
- Well done, Fiamma.

20:31.834 --> 20:34.541
It seems the bar has been raised,
Radfield.

20:43.209 --> 20:44.623
Come on, Fiamma.

20:44.750 --> 20:47.916
Fiamma, we're your horses,
so you have to feed us.

20:49.417 --> 20:51.791
- Tally-ho!
- Wait for me.

20:51.917 --> 20:55.208
Apparently, Miss G has ended
her affair with Mr Du Toit.

20:55.334 --> 20:57.249
He's one of the fathers.

20:57.375 --> 20:59.875
She wasn't in love with him,
it was purely physical.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.791
- They were driven by their lust.
- Is that true?

21:02.917 --> 21:05.624
It's absolute tosh.
Lily, stop making a show of yourself.

21:05.750 --> 21:09.708
And I saw Mr Du Toit once.
He was very handsome.

21:09.834 --> 21:11.541
Like a movie star.

21:11.667 --> 21:16.999
He had big strong hands and blue eyes
that promised wild adventures.

21:17.125 --> 21:18.999
So really, it's entirely possible

21:19.125 --> 21:21.666
that he and Miss G could have
given in to their desire.

21:21.792 --> 21:23.541
I quite fancied him for myself.

21:23.667 --> 21:26.874
Because older men know all
about female sexual ecstasy.

21:27.000 --> 21:30.208
Lily, I think one day
you shall have a first in sex.

21:33.292 --> 21:34.708
What's that?

21:34.834 --> 21:37.999
For my breathing.
It clears the passages.

21:42.292 --> 21:47.000
Oh, it smells.
Like my grandmother's linen drawer.

21:48.250 --> 21:49.750
Come on, Rosie.

21:49.875 --> 21:51.583
You've got the black spot.

21:52.125 --> 21:53.624
On your head.

21:53.750 --> 21:54.958
Black spot.

21:56.500 --> 21:59.291
- Didn't you notice?
- So what?

21:59.417 --> 22:01.583
It means you're going to die.

22:01.709 --> 22:04.458
I'd better go back
to the school then.

22:09.417 --> 22:11.624
She's obviously never read
"Treasure Island".

22:11.750 --> 22:14.124
She has no idea what you're on about.

22:14.250 --> 22:15.959
Poppy!

22:16.084 --> 22:19.165
It weren't me
and you can't prove a thing.

22:19.292 --> 22:24.249
Mind my peg-leg.

22:24.375 --> 22:26.458
And my parrot.

23:04.459 --> 23:10.084
Spelling.

23:10.959 --> 23:14.041
Oh, Fuzzy, grammar.

23:16.000 --> 23:20.666
- She reads our letters?
- Of course. What did you think?

23:22.667 --> 23:26.123
- Who's Pablo?
- A friend.

23:26.250 --> 23:30.333
- A boyfriend?
- A boy and a friend.

23:30.459 --> 23:34.000
- A prince?
- No. Regrettably.

23:34.125 --> 23:37.959
- Is that why you were banished?
- I was not banished.

23:38.084 --> 23:41.834
- Like Romeo and Juliet?
- Do it again.

23:41.959 --> 23:45.708
- And don't sound so down in the dumps.
- Yes, Miss.

23:45.834 --> 23:48.165
Letters are greetings.

23:48.292 --> 23:52.083
Use this opportunity
to show your dear parents

23:52.209 --> 23:54.834
your fine penmanship
and turn of phrase.

23:55.834 --> 23:59.583
Don't harry them for tuck
and pocket money.

24:01.834 --> 24:02.916
- Is that for me?
- No.

24:03.042 --> 24:04.541
Are you sure?
I think I can see my name.

24:04.667 --> 24:06.123
No. Shoo. Go on, off with you.

24:10.209 --> 24:12.166
Persephone Burls?

24:17.750 --> 24:19.624
Fuzzy, for you, I think.

24:19.750 --> 24:22.791
- Can't make head nor tail of the stamps.
- They're Egyptian.

24:29.792 --> 24:31.499
Fiamma Coronna.

24:31.625 --> 24:34.624
You see? You haven't been forgotten.

24:34.750 --> 24:36.791
That's all, I'm afraid, girls.

24:36.917 --> 24:39.332
But I'm sure Fiamma won't mind
sharing her treasures.

24:40.750 --> 24:43.333
"Dear Persephone,
hope you're well and studying hard."

24:43.459 --> 24:46.499
"Daddy's taking up his post in Rhodesia
a week earlier than expected..."

24:46.625 --> 24:48.458
Aren't you going to open it, then?

24:51.792 --> 24:55.458
- Here?
- Come on, show us. Let's see.

25:11.250 --> 25:12.750
Look at this!

25:18.167 --> 25:19.792
Go on.

25:22.667 --> 25:24.791
This is heaven.

25:27.625 --> 25:29.874
Fiamma, tell me the story again.

25:30.417 --> 25:33.208
- I told you last night.
- I like it. Please.

25:33.334 --> 25:34.541
Please.

25:35.917 --> 25:39.791
There once was a king
and his beloved daughter.

25:39.917 --> 25:44.290
Together they explored distant lands.

25:44.417 --> 25:47.708
One day,
they encountered a sultan

25:47.834 --> 25:51.624
who offered the king
an extraordinary gift

25:51.750 --> 25:55.708
in return for his daughter's hand.

25:55.834 --> 25:58.791
A magical blue diamond.

26:00.417 --> 26:03.333
But the king was greedy

26:03.459 --> 26:05.458
and took both,

26:05.584 --> 26:10.416
the diamond and the Princess
back to his mighty castillllo.

26:10.542 --> 26:13.957
But the Sultan came looking
for the Princess

26:14.084 --> 26:18.625
and begged her to fly away with him

26:18.750 --> 26:21.957
on a magical tapestry of silk.

26:29.792 --> 26:33.915
And the Princess was so intoxicated

26:34.042 --> 26:37.458
that she flew away with him

26:39.375 --> 26:41.374
never to be seen again.

28:33.500 --> 28:35.416
Can't sleep, Di?

28:37.667 --> 28:39.333
I was thinking of home.

28:47.459 --> 28:50.083
Would be a shame to waste
such a beautiful night.

28:50.209 --> 28:53.124
Come on. We're going swimming.
Wake the others.

28:54.667 --> 28:56.166
Lily.

28:59.125 --> 29:02.458
- Laurel, wake up.
- Wake up. We're going swimming.

29:03.542 --> 29:06.041
Don't be ridiculous.
It's the middle of the night.

29:06.167 --> 29:09.208
It's a compulsory lesson.
You can't bunk. Get up!

29:09.334 --> 29:12.874
What lesson?
What are you talking about?

30:02.542 --> 30:04.583
What are you waiting for?
Kingdom come?

30:09.375 --> 30:10.416
Lily!

30:23.709 --> 30:25.292
I'll splash you.

30:36.042 --> 30:39.208
- Got to swim faster than that.
- You're mother!

30:39.334 --> 30:41.790
- How do I play?
- Chase the mother fish. Chase Di.

30:41.917 --> 30:43.459
You're mother.

30:47.750 --> 30:50.124
- Who's mother now?
- You're mother.

31:12.750 --> 31:14.584
Miss G learnt this game in India.

31:15.625 --> 31:20.833
Really? I love India.
When were you there?

31:20.959 --> 31:22.208
A few years ago.

31:22.334 --> 31:26.208
Miss G, tell Fiamma about
how you rode on elephants with rajas!

31:26.334 --> 31:29.541
Oh, Di, we've all heard that story before.

31:29.667 --> 31:31.874
I'd rather hear
about Fiamma's adventures.

31:32.000 --> 31:36.458
I haven't had adventures.
I just travelled with my father.

31:36.584 --> 31:38.166
Miss G travelled alone.

31:39.459 --> 31:40.748
Really?

31:40.875 --> 31:43.916
I was a bit of a scandal in my day.

31:44.042 --> 31:46.584
I remember one captain
who was quite loath

31:46.709 --> 31:49.375
to having an unaccompanied woman
on board.

31:49.500 --> 31:53.832
It caused such a stir, I was forced
to disembark at the next port.

31:58.292 --> 31:59.958
Where else have you been, Fiamma?

32:01.125 --> 32:06.166
Abyssinia, Somaliland, the Dodecanese.

32:06.292 --> 32:08.124
And Paris.

32:08.250 --> 32:10.416
Paris is filthy.

32:13.625 --> 32:15.791
Do you care for Paris?

32:16.959 --> 32:19.249
I love to travel.

32:20.500 --> 32:23.873
One day I shall have to resume
my exploration of the world.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.333
It's in our blood, isn't it?

32:28.417 --> 32:31.458
You're not like the other girls.

32:31.584 --> 32:34.958
They're still waiting
for their lives to begin.

32:35.084 --> 32:37.041
But not you.

32:42.375 --> 32:44.374
But you can go whenever you choose.

32:48.417 --> 32:49.916
Why do you stay?

32:53.417 --> 32:55.041
I stay for my girls, of course.

32:56.875 --> 33:00.958
When they leave, so shall I.

33:52.417 --> 33:54.707
This is out of bounds, Miss Gribben.

33:56.084 --> 33:59.540
I had no idea. Nothing is locked.

33:59.667 --> 34:04.250
It is an honour system.
We respect confidentiality here.

34:04.375 --> 34:06.208
And I thought
you would have known that.

34:09.708 --> 34:11.791
Quite a scandal though, wasn't it?

34:11.917 --> 34:16.123
A countess stealing away with a peasant.
And a Marxist, to boot!

34:16.250 --> 34:18.998
Imagine the daring, the courage.

34:19.125 --> 34:21.873
That is neither here nor there.

34:22.000 --> 34:26.623
We have had to protect many girls
from themselves over the years.

34:26.750 --> 34:31.458
I just felt if I knew a little of her
history, I could be of more help.

34:32.875 --> 34:37.623
All our girls are to be treated equally,
regardless of their past.

34:37.750 --> 34:40.041
As you well know, Miss Gribben.

34:42.750 --> 34:45.166
You have been with us a long time.

34:50.167 --> 34:51.873
I'm sorry, Miss Nieven.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.791
It was an error of judgment.
It won't happen again.

34:54.917 --> 34:57.374
See that it doesn't.

34:59.750 --> 35:02.292
The world is a perilous place.

35:02.417 --> 35:06.458
It would be a shame for you
to have to find that out firsthand.

35:36.292 --> 35:40.540
So have you decided?
Is it a centre-piece for a dinner party?

35:41.709 --> 35:44.541
Or a christening?

35:44.667 --> 35:49.041
Or a simple 'get well' arrangement
for an ailing relative.

35:49.167 --> 35:53.999
Or have you any ideas of your own?
You can be creative.

35:57.292 --> 36:00.457
The world falls at her feet
because she's an aristocrat.

36:00.584 --> 36:04.209
It's so unjust. So unearned.

36:07.834 --> 36:10.291
Fuzzy Burls, what have you done?

36:10.417 --> 36:12.624
Fuzzy never gets any help.

36:16.417 --> 36:19.000
Did you hear? Your father
called for you on the telephone.

36:19.125 --> 36:22.373
- My father?
- The prince himself.

36:22.500 --> 36:23.916
Why wasn't I told?

36:24.042 --> 36:26.583
God knows where you were.
We looked everywhere for you.

36:26.709 --> 36:29.916
- In the end he had to speak to Lily.
- What did he say?

36:30.042 --> 36:33.958
Well... I think he took
quite a shine to Lily.

36:35.500 --> 36:37.416
He's arranged to see her next week.

36:37.542 --> 36:40.209
He's sending a carriage
and champagne for her.

36:41.000 --> 36:44.332
Your father's a randy bugger, Fiamma.

36:44.459 --> 36:47.874
He's going to deflower
our precious Lily.

36:48.875 --> 36:50.708
You shouldn't be cruel.

36:53.834 --> 36:56.916
Excuse me, Miss Cairns.

36:57.042 --> 36:59.833
I was wondering if I might take advantage
of the glorious sunshine

36:59.959 --> 37:02.583
and steal the girls away
for a dive.

37:02.709 --> 37:03.874
By all means.

37:06.834 --> 37:08.499
Fiamma, dear?

37:10.417 --> 37:13.084
If you don't mind, Miss Cairns,
I wish to stay.

37:14.709 --> 37:18.124
Fiamma, the great British summertime
rarely indulges us.

37:18.250 --> 37:23.540
It is barely past lunch.
I will get a cramp and sink like a stone.

37:27.792 --> 37:28.833
Suit yourself.

37:29.959 --> 37:31.499
Girls.

37:45.959 --> 37:47.708
Last dive, girls.

37:47.834 --> 37:51.499
Show me something interpretive.

37:55.292 --> 37:59.834
- Come on, be sexy, girls!
- Look, Miss G.

38:01.834 --> 38:05.166
- Well done, Fuzzy.
- Elephant. Poodle.

38:07.625 --> 38:08.958
Chicken dance.

39:06.834 --> 39:08.749
No textbooks today, girls.

39:21.167 --> 39:22.834
Ooh La La.

39:31.917 --> 39:35.874
- Look at this!
- Look at this hat.

40:15.459 --> 40:19.959
Now, a story about Africa, I think.

40:21.292 --> 40:24.416
The last remains of the First Mate.

40:26.084 --> 40:28.667
Mr Riley I believe his name was.

40:28.792 --> 40:32.499
He died in a mandrake swamp
on the way to the Congo Franḉais.

40:32.625 --> 40:34.458
Poor Mr Riley.

40:34.584 --> 40:36.541
We were touring in a steamer,

40:36.667 --> 40:41.291
but he wanted to take a canoe
and explore deeper into the lagoon.

40:41.417 --> 40:46.000
A fascinating pursuit, but a pleasure
to be indulged with caution,

40:46.125 --> 40:48.583
for you are certain
to come across crocodiles.

40:49.959 --> 40:53.624
Taken, he was,
right out of the canoe.

40:53.750 --> 40:58.333
It was a case of
'here one minute, gone the next'.

41:03.125 --> 41:04.959
Foolish man.

41:08.042 --> 41:11.291
Probably spent his last moments
wondering why,

41:11.417 --> 41:13.374
having reached this point of folly...

41:13.500 --> 41:15.208
he need have gilded the lily

41:15.334 --> 41:18.834
by fooling around in mangrove
swamps.

41:25.417 --> 41:28.291
You must have heard me
tell this one before.

41:29.625 --> 41:31.166
I believe I must.

41:35.917 --> 41:38.874
Nevertheless... we...

41:39.917 --> 41:41.916
we pushed on towards
the Ogowe River...

41:44.042 --> 41:46.999
plagued by mandrake flies.

41:47.125 --> 41:49.834
The stench of the swamp...

41:49.959 --> 41:52.958
Fairy tales.
Like all her stories.

41:54.125 --> 41:56.458
Now not only are there crocodiles...

41:56.584 --> 41:58.291
Miss G has risked it all.

41:59.584 --> 42:04.291
She's fearless and true
and an example to everyone of us.

42:04.417 --> 42:08.708
I think you'll find Mary Kingsley
risked it all in 1 *(&.

42:09.709 --> 42:11.833
A bestseller, I think.

42:11.959 --> 42:14.624
It was certainly translated into Spanish.

42:16.417 --> 42:21.208
To exit and begin its external life.

42:26.459 --> 42:29.166
Come on, Laurel, you can do it.

42:32.834 --> 42:34.207
Come on, Poppy!

42:37.500 --> 42:39.916
Fantastic, Laurel.

42:40.042 --> 42:41.958
Well done, Laurel.

43:25.042 --> 43:26.834
Where's your courage?

43:28.959 --> 43:31.291
Why? Why can't you give your all?

43:31.417 --> 43:34.249
Where is your poetry? Your passion?

43:35.459 --> 43:37.499
Why do I bother?

43:39.209 --> 43:40.875
Fiamma.

43:41.000 --> 43:42.500
We're not finished.

43:43.459 --> 43:45.374
Can we have another go, too?

43:45.500 --> 43:48.999
No. Fiamma has another dive in her.

43:50.084 --> 43:52.874
We shall all wait until she finds it.

43:59.625 --> 44:01.208
Fiamma.

44:52.875 --> 44:56.041
Where is she? Has she drowned?

44:56.167 --> 44:59.124
I'm not going to save her.

44:59.250 --> 45:01.833
She'll pop up like a cork
in a minute.

45:01.959 --> 45:06.208
Fiamma has an intrepid spirit.
Real mettle in her soul.

45:08.792 --> 45:11.625
Imagine possessing what she has.

45:11.750 --> 45:16.165
How different
to this dull, aching existence.

45:16.959 --> 45:20.750
Only Fiamma is willing to risk it all.

45:20.875 --> 45:23.833
To push herself beyond her boundaries.

45:31.792 --> 45:34.334
You may go and get changed.

45:39.667 --> 45:41.915
Circuits for the rest of you.

45:42.042 --> 45:43.750
It's not fair.

46:07.834 --> 46:10.291
That was top-notch today,
Fiamma.

46:10.417 --> 46:13.041
Don't feel bad for the others,
you can't help being the best.

46:19.042 --> 46:20.916
We have a great deal in common,
you know.

46:24.750 --> 46:28.292
We have experienced so much,
you and I.

46:28.417 --> 46:30.124
So much the same.

46:35.375 --> 46:38.208
There's no reason why we shouldn't be
the best of friends.

46:52.750 --> 46:55.334
I don't understand
why we were punished with circuits.

46:55.459 --> 46:59.499
I did my best dive today,
and Miss G didn't even notice.

46:59.625 --> 47:02.624
- I thought Laurel was very brave.
- Thank you.

47:02.750 --> 47:07.375
- So why are we in trouble?
- Fiamma set the standard.

47:07.500 --> 47:11.873
So? When you set the standard,
we weren't made to suffer.

47:42.709 --> 47:45.500
- What are you doing?
- We're drawing from life.

47:46.084 --> 47:49.041
- Has anyone seen Fiamma?
- No.

47:50.709 --> 47:53.500
Have you not seen her anywhere?

47:54.250 --> 47:56.291
She's been in a bate
since this morning.

47:56.417 --> 48:00.208
- I thought it was more of a wuss.
- No, definitely a bate.

48:02.084 --> 48:04.291
Did you try the library
or the rough patch?

48:04.417 --> 48:06.416
I've done that twice now.

48:07.250 --> 48:08.707
Twice...

48:14.750 --> 48:17.459
We should help look for her,
I suppose.

48:19.292 --> 48:21.291
Come on.

48:24.000 --> 48:25.500
We're on a mission for Miss G!

48:25.625 --> 48:29.209
But it's so hot.
Can't we just stay here?

48:30.667 --> 48:32.749
Fine. I'll go on my own, then.

48:57.709 --> 48:59.833
Look, over there!

49:06.250 --> 49:07.582
There you are.

49:08.667 --> 49:10.958
Quite elusive today, aren't you?

49:11.667 --> 49:13.708
Why must you follow me?

49:16.459 --> 49:18.707
We didn't finish
our conversation yesterday.

49:20.250 --> 49:22.249
I've nothing to say to you.

49:24.084 --> 49:25.624
I see.

49:29.292 --> 49:32.333
You know, you really should make
more of an effort to fit in.

49:32.459 --> 49:35.208
I will not be here
long enough to fit in.

49:38.459 --> 49:40.458
My father will come and get me.

49:41.459 --> 49:43.083
Of course, dear.

49:43.792 --> 49:46.334
But, you see, Laurel came for a term.

49:47.167 --> 49:50.540
So did Rosie. Fuzzy thought
she was going to be a day girl.

49:50.667 --> 49:53.334
Only Di realised this is forever.

50:00.125 --> 50:02.458
It is not forever.

50:02.584 --> 50:04.125
They will leave you.

50:20.500 --> 50:22.624
And a loaf for Matron, please.

50:25.542 --> 50:28.708
Four sugared rolls, three jam tarts
and a loaf for Matron, please.

50:28.834 --> 50:30.417
Four sugared rolls, three jam tarts...

50:51.917 --> 50:54.541
Four sugared rolls, three jam tarts
and a loaf for Matron.

50:55.750 --> 50:59.499
Four sugared rolls, three jam tarts
and a loaf for Matron, please.

51:18.417 --> 51:19.790
Can I help you?

51:19.917 --> 51:23.374
Four sugared rolls, three jam tarts
and a loaf for Matron, please.

51:37.834 --> 51:39.583
Will that be all, Miss?

51:43.000 --> 51:44.166
Miss?

51:45.959 --> 51:50.124
And a... a quarter of lemon sherbets,
please.

52:51.042 --> 52:53.833
I hope this makes
the homesickness go away.

52:57.125 --> 53:00.291
Nothing worse than feeling all alone
somewhere foreign.

53:01.292 --> 53:02.874
I know that feeling.

53:03.000 --> 53:07.124
And I know how important
even a small kindness can be.

53:10.084 --> 53:12.041
Fuzzy?

53:12.167 --> 53:16.041
I don't think that's a good idea, Burls.
You make too big a splash as it is.

53:23.209 --> 53:24.291
It's not fair.

53:29.125 --> 53:32.540
Please. Help yourselves.

53:50.292 --> 53:52.125
What good is that going to do, Rosie?

53:52.250 --> 53:54.415
I don't have any money.

53:54.542 --> 53:56.291
Give us one of your shortbreads, then.

53:58.375 --> 54:02.458
Rosie, this is deadly serious.
Do as you are told.

54:14.959 --> 54:16.708
Good riddance!

54:28.125 --> 54:29.791
Come on.

54:32.375 --> 54:34.708
Right, let's find Fiamma.

54:48.875 --> 54:50.374
Get up!

54:51.209 --> 54:52.792
You're going home.

55:04.417 --> 55:06.249
There's food, money and a map.

55:06.375 --> 55:09.541
There's a ferry that leaves in an hour
so you need to get a move on.

55:09.667 --> 55:12.374
You do want to go home, don't you?

55:12.500 --> 55:16.749
Back to your villa and boyfriend
and the diamonds and parties?

55:18.000 --> 55:20.166
Thank you. I do.

55:28.167 --> 55:32.041
Don't come back!
I mean it, don't you ever come back!

55:40.417 --> 55:45.416
♪ Your vows you've broken like my heart

55:45.542 --> 55:50.958
♪ Oh why did you so enrapture me?

55:51.959 --> 55:56.415
♪ Now I remain in a world apart

55:56.542 --> 56:01.499
♪ Though my heart
remains in captivity ♪

56:04.375 --> 56:06.875
Bath night for Fuzzy,
Laurel and Fiamma.

56:15.292 --> 56:17.959
- Where is Fiamma Coronna?
- I'll have her bath!

56:18.084 --> 56:19.916
No, you won't, Poppy.

56:20.542 --> 56:22.374
Where is Fiamma?

56:23.542 --> 56:25.291
Don't know, Matron.

56:27.417 --> 56:29.166
Hiding in the rose garden?

56:31.042 --> 56:32.457
Di Radfield, where is she?

56:33.667 --> 56:37.833
I have no idea, Matron.
She's a law unto herself.

56:39.417 --> 56:44.000
♪ And that yet once before I die... ♪

56:45.750 --> 56:49.207
We have not had
an event like this in all my time.

56:49.334 --> 56:52.749
Our reputation is at stake.
Our own good name.

56:52.875 --> 56:54.666
I blame myself.
I have been too lenient.

56:54.792 --> 56:57.708
In many ways the diving team
has been a great success.

56:57.834 --> 57:02.041
I do not wish to diminish
your great achievements with these girls

57:02.167 --> 57:05.499
when I say that they lack
a sense of proportion.

57:05.625 --> 57:09.333
Fiamma must learn that she is
no more special than any other child.

57:09.459 --> 57:11.042
I'll use a firmer hand.

57:11.167 --> 57:15.000
Good. Now we must pray this child
returns to us unharmed.

57:15.875 --> 57:18.583
- Try it again, please.
- 'Very well.'

57:26.500 --> 57:29.458
'There's still no answer.
May I suggest you try later?'

57:29.584 --> 57:34.249
I have to speak to him.
He has to come and get me.

57:34.375 --> 57:36.041
'Please try again later.'

58:05.084 --> 58:08.625
- Last crossing, Miss.
- No, thank you.

58:10.750 --> 58:12.999
I don't care for open water.

58:21.125 --> 58:22.667
Come.

58:24.417 --> 58:25.833
Miss G?

58:25.959 --> 58:29.248
We were all wondering
if there was any news.

58:29.375 --> 58:31.708
News? No.

58:34.292 --> 58:36.249
Perhaps she's returned to Spain.

58:37.417 --> 58:41.624
How foolish if she has.
No one is missing her there.

58:45.459 --> 58:47.291
Why are you cross?

58:48.292 --> 58:51.124
I thought the team would be
better off without her.

58:52.209 --> 58:54.124
Well, you thought wrong!

58:56.125 --> 58:59.374
And when I want your opinion,
I'll ask for it.

59:38.709 --> 59:41.624
I don't think we need
to pursue this matter.

59:41.750 --> 59:43.749
She must've been
out in the cold for hours.

59:43.875 --> 59:48.416
We found her by the side of the road.
She was in such a state, poor girl.

59:50.917 --> 59:52.208
She's back!

59:53.125 --> 59:55.541
They caught her dodging a bus fare
on the mainland.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.166
Girls!

01:00:02.209 --> 01:00:03.291
Lights out!

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.999
I'm really glad you came back.

01:00:48.375 --> 01:00:50.791
Fiamma! Come on, Fiamma!

01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:07.041
Amazing!

01:01:13.334 --> 01:01:15.416
Go on, Fuzzy.

01:01:16.292 --> 01:01:22.041
Girls, we are... angels, eagles.

01:01:23.792 --> 01:01:25.333
To dive is to fly.

01:01:36.584 --> 01:01:39.499
Set yourself free of the shackles
of conformity.

01:01:39.625 --> 01:01:44.208
Let nothing hold you back
except the air itself.

01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:58.166
You are between heaven and earth.

01:01:58.292 --> 01:02:00.708
The rules no longer apply.

01:02:17.292 --> 01:02:20.499
I'm bored of practice.
When do we compete?

01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:25.499
We can have a little competition now
if you like.

01:02:25.625 --> 01:02:29.166
No, I want to compete
against another team.

01:02:29.292 --> 01:02:30.958
Radfield, pick a team.

01:02:31.084 --> 01:02:32.416
Lily.

01:02:32.542 --> 01:02:34.499
Fiamma, you can be captain of team B.
Your turn to choose.

01:02:34.625 --> 01:02:35.624
Pick me!

01:02:35.750 --> 01:02:38.459
Real competitions.
Against other schools.

01:02:38.584 --> 01:02:41.249
With prizes and trophies.

01:02:41.375 --> 01:02:44.166
You do have trophies?

01:02:44.292 --> 01:02:47.083
- Miss G?
- We're training to compete.

01:02:47.209 --> 01:02:49.791
How many meets have you attended
with this team?

01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:52.873
None.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:54.709
None?

01:02:55.375 --> 01:02:56.708
We have never competed.

01:02:57.834 --> 01:02:59.166
You've never been ready.

01:03:01.625 --> 01:03:04.541
- But I feel ready.
- I feel ready, too.

01:03:04.667 --> 01:03:06.708
What's the point if we don't compete?

01:03:06.834 --> 01:03:09.584
I won't tolerate a mutiny.

01:03:09.709 --> 01:03:13.334
Since Fiamma seems to know what's
best for you, let her take the reins!

01:04:02.292 --> 01:04:05.374
You shouldn't be so bloody superior
all the time.

01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:08.915
You're making her miserable, you know.
And ruining the team.

01:04:10.375 --> 01:04:12.333
If we're to be lumbered with you,

01:04:12.459 --> 01:04:15.958
you have to learn the happiness of the
team is more important than your own.

01:04:16.084 --> 01:04:19.208
I have no interest
in being part of your team.

01:04:19.334 --> 01:04:22.083
I'm not even meant to be here.

01:04:23.667 --> 01:04:25.083
Well, you're here now!

01:04:25.209 --> 01:04:29.208
So you had better make the best of it
and stop being so bloody selfish.

01:04:29.334 --> 01:04:33.208
I'm not selfish.
I just want to go home.

01:04:33.334 --> 01:04:36.166
Don't you think
we all want to go home?

01:05:51.750 --> 01:05:53.666
You can keep it if you like.

01:06:02.709 --> 01:06:04.375
Thank you.

01:06:11.875 --> 01:06:14.666
Maybe if I were kinder to Miss G,

01:06:14.792 --> 01:06:17.124
she would be kinder to you.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:22.500
Maybe.

01:06:24.417 --> 01:06:26.083
I will try.

01:06:27.209 --> 01:06:29.041
No promises.

01:06:50.250 --> 01:06:52.665
Dreg in a midge wig.

01:06:55.667 --> 01:06:58.334
I'm bored. What should we do?

01:06:58.459 --> 01:07:00.582
We could play hide and seek?
Piggy in the middle?

01:07:00.709 --> 01:07:01.624
Red Rover?

01:07:01.750 --> 01:07:05.958
We should do something fun
for a change. Like a midnight feast.

01:07:07.125 --> 01:07:10.498
Fiamma, do you have
a suggestion for us?

01:07:15.750 --> 01:07:17.833
The feast of St Agnes.

01:07:19.042 --> 01:07:23.833
On St Agnes Eve, if a woman
performs certain divinations,

01:07:23.959 --> 01:07:27.541
she will see a vision
of her future husband

01:07:27.667 --> 01:07:30.041
and he will eat and drink with her.

01:07:31.667 --> 01:07:34.958
- Divinations are ungodly.
- Oh, Rosie, it's Keats.

01:07:35.084 --> 01:07:38.540
Brilliant! Some of us can be Madeline
and some Porphyro.

01:07:38.667 --> 01:07:40.916
We can dress up and have
a beadsman and a baledown.

01:07:41.042 --> 01:07:44.333
- Someone can hobble around.
- I'll be Porphyro with his steed.

01:07:44.459 --> 01:07:48.417
I'll be Madeline and pray
for a dream lover in the moonlight.

01:07:49.959 --> 01:07:52.499
Then it's decided.
Everyone must bring food.

01:07:52.625 --> 01:07:54.916
And we shall need flowers
for our hair.

01:07:55.042 --> 01:07:57.041
We're going to have so much fun.
You'll see.

01:08:01.417 --> 01:08:04.042
Then, of course,
the fifth form was just lovely,

01:08:04.167 --> 01:08:07.291
lashings and lashings of cut flowers.

01:08:49.834 --> 01:08:51.874
- Have I missed it?
- Come on, it's starting.

01:08:55.959 --> 01:08:59.166
Those are good.
Will you help with the Madelines?

01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:03.000
Somebody do my hair.

01:09:05.292 --> 01:09:07.457
Everyone looks so marvellous.

01:09:12.417 --> 01:09:14.416
It's like that.

01:09:23.584 --> 01:09:24.624
Bless you.

01:09:58.584 --> 01:10:01.666
- How do I look?
- Exquisite.

01:10:02.375 --> 01:10:05.167
Di, come over here.

01:10:17.500 --> 01:10:20.333
Even more tinned peaches!

01:10:24.375 --> 01:10:26.875
Laurel, can I have one
of your toffees, please?

01:10:28.209 --> 01:10:30.833
I could not get to sleep.
I just couldn't sleep.

01:10:35.709 --> 01:10:37.209
Rosie!

01:10:40.125 --> 01:10:42.749
Fiamma, you've kissed a boy,
haven't you?

01:10:42.875 --> 01:10:44.124
I have.

01:10:44.250 --> 01:10:46.833
Tell me how to do it. In detail.

01:10:46.959 --> 01:10:49.833
It can't be taught. You must practise
on the back of your hand.

01:10:50.709 --> 01:10:53.583
Or on the gardener's boy!

01:10:55.334 --> 01:10:56.875
Such amateurs.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.833
Listen, it's all very well to moon
after a pash,

01:10:59.959 --> 01:11:03.749
but there comes a time
when you have to grow up

01:11:03.875 --> 01:11:05.958
and find a proper man
and get your knickers off!

01:11:11.917 --> 01:11:14.166
Because you know all about that,
don't you, Lily?

01:11:14.292 --> 01:11:15.792
Fuzzy!

01:11:55.709 --> 01:11:57.249
It's quite a noise, isn't it?

01:11:57.375 --> 01:11:59.458
It's a midnight feast.

01:11:59.584 --> 01:12:02.791
But food is not permitted in dormitories.

01:12:02.917 --> 01:12:06.041
They asked me for permission
and I allowed it.

01:12:06.167 --> 01:12:08.708
It is not for you
to grant such permission.

01:12:08.834 --> 01:12:12.165
Go to bed, old woman.

01:12:12.292 --> 01:12:15.499
Miss Nieven will hear of this.

01:12:41.667 --> 01:12:43.333
I feel so funny.

01:13:26.375 --> 01:13:29.541
- Come on, Fiamma, help us out.
- Someone's coming.

01:13:29.667 --> 01:13:33.333
- Drag her to the bed, quick.
- Shut up, it's not funny.

01:13:42.292 --> 01:13:46.624
Sorry, Miss G. We didn't know
she'd had so much to drink.

01:13:48.042 --> 01:13:50.999
See that this room
is put back together.

01:13:52.750 --> 01:13:55.041
And clean yourselves up.

01:13:55.542 --> 01:13:56.958
You look a fright.

01:14:09.292 --> 01:14:12.000
I shall hide her until she's sober.

01:14:12.125 --> 01:14:15.041
It will do none of us any good
if she's discovered in this state.

01:14:20.459 --> 01:14:23.708
- Sorry, Miss G.
- Thank you, Miss G.

01:14:23.834 --> 01:14:25.833
Thank you.

01:14:25.959 --> 01:14:27.458
Sorry.

01:14:47.417 --> 01:14:49.791
I would do anything for you.

01:14:52.792 --> 01:14:55.123
You do know that, don't you?

01:14:57.542 --> 01:15:00.708
We're going to be great friends,
you and I.

01:15:01.417 --> 01:15:03.959
And share simply everything.

01:15:08.459 --> 01:15:11.291
We'll see the world together.

01:15:12.417 --> 01:15:13.917
We...

01:15:15.084 --> 01:15:18.917
We will ride with bandits
in South America

01:15:19.042 --> 01:15:22.458
with rough diamonds
hidden in our saddles.

01:15:24.584 --> 01:15:26.791
There are islands, you know,

01:15:26.917 --> 01:15:29.666
where there are undiscovered tribes,

01:15:29.792 --> 01:15:32.708
places no one has explored.

01:15:42.084 --> 01:15:44.041
We'll climb the canopies of Amazonas

01:15:44.167 --> 01:15:48.499
and talk of the life we've lived.

01:15:50.292 --> 01:15:52.834
Anything is possible, you know.

01:15:53.875 --> 01:15:57.541
But you have to learn... to share.

01:15:59.250 --> 01:16:01.708
You can't make friends beg.

01:16:56.625 --> 01:16:58.666
Don't make me beg.

01:17:42.459 --> 01:17:45.749

- I'm waiting for Fiamma.

01:18:40.084 --> 01:18:41.916
I can smell your sick.

01:18:42.042 --> 01:18:43.458
Sorry.

01:18:45.459 --> 01:18:50.624
If you need to heave,
do it where I can't see it or smell it.

01:19:04.417 --> 01:19:06.249
What do you think
they're talking about?

01:19:08.875 --> 01:19:12.500
- Maybe something they did last night.
- What do you mean?

01:19:14.125 --> 01:19:18.749
Fiamma's not a virgin, you know.
She's quite the little whore.

01:19:20.334 --> 01:19:25.291
She seduced that beastly foreigner
and now she's seduced our Miss G.

01:19:28.542 --> 01:19:32.041
- You're upsetting the others.
- I don't care.

01:19:32.167 --> 01:19:35.667
Let them be upset.
Let them see that I hate you.

01:19:37.834 --> 01:19:40.833
I want them to know
what you really are.

01:20:24.292 --> 01:20:26.291
Is everything all right, Miss G?

01:20:26.875 --> 01:20:28.999
Has something happened?

01:20:31.292 --> 01:20:34.083
I was thinking of resuming
my travels.

01:20:34.959 --> 01:20:36.708
In the holidays?

01:20:38.334 --> 01:20:40.249
And beyond.

01:20:40.875 --> 01:20:42.375
Miss G!

01:20:44.625 --> 01:20:47.291
There are parts of Asia
I would like to see.

01:20:48.917 --> 01:20:51.083
The silk route of Xi'an,

01:20:51.209 --> 01:20:53.458
the highlands of Tibet.

01:20:58.417 --> 01:21:00.458
You won't leave us.

01:21:05.084 --> 01:21:07.333
I have to leave.

01:21:08.500 --> 01:21:12.166
Fiamma wants to make it impossible
for me to stay.

01:21:12.292 --> 01:21:14.707
But what can she do?

01:21:21.459 --> 01:21:25.166
She intends to spread hateful lies
about me.

01:21:26.375 --> 01:21:30.416
She will destroy my reputation.
Do you understand?

01:21:37.500 --> 01:21:41.416
I am eyeless in Gaza,
betrayed to the Philistines.

01:22:24.709 --> 01:22:25.791
Come on.

01:22:51.042 --> 01:22:53.916
- Fiamma, get out!
- Go away.

01:22:54.042 --> 01:22:57.166
Di! You're being too rough!

01:23:03.667 --> 01:23:08.083
Miss G is leaving us,
and it's all Fiamma's fault!

01:23:08.209 --> 01:23:10.208
We are abandoned.

01:23:11.334 --> 01:23:13.333
What happened with Miss G last night?

01:23:14.792 --> 01:23:16.459
You have to tell us the truth.

01:23:16.584 --> 01:23:19.459
Were you playing St Agnes Eve
with Miss G last night?

01:23:19.584 --> 01:23:21.833
You have to answer.

01:23:22.500 --> 01:23:24.666
I don't feel well.

01:23:24.792 --> 01:23:26.708
Not so fast Princess Fiamma.

01:23:26.834 --> 01:23:29.166
You have to tell us
what happened last night.

01:23:31.250 --> 01:23:33.291
What do you think happened?

01:23:34.625 --> 01:23:38.167
Did you do it with Miss G?
Did you do it for real?

01:23:38.292 --> 01:23:40.665
You're not a virgin, are you?

01:23:40.792 --> 01:23:43.499
You said you would be kind.
Not disgusting.

01:23:43.625 --> 01:23:46.833
You know what's happened.

01:23:46.959 --> 01:23:50.459
Look at what she has done to me!
Why can't you see it?

01:23:52.709 --> 01:23:54.749
- Liar!
- No!

01:23:55.459 --> 01:23:58.457
We have to tell someone
what she has done to me.

01:24:03.125 --> 01:24:04.624
No.

01:24:09.750 --> 01:24:12.458
- Take it back.
- No!

01:24:15.167 --> 01:24:16.833
That's not how you play.

01:24:22.459 --> 01:24:23.583
After her!

01:24:40.042 --> 01:24:42.041
Where did she go?

01:24:42.167 --> 01:24:43.916
I can see her. Follow me!

01:25:09.292 --> 01:25:11.791
We're coming to get you!

01:25:12.334 --> 01:25:13.958
Where are you?

01:25:14.084 --> 01:25:15.708
I can see her!

01:25:38.584 --> 01:25:40.916
You disgusting, horrible girl.

01:25:43.542 --> 01:25:48.499
Filthy girl!
We're going to teach you a lesson.

01:25:48.625 --> 01:25:50.541
You cow!

01:25:52.209 --> 01:25:54.498
- Leave me alone.
- Poppy, Di, stop, please!

01:25:54.625 --> 01:25:56.292
I can't breathe!

01:25:56.417 --> 01:25:59.917
Di, she's had enough.
Please, please stop it.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.791
Di. Di, what's wrong with her?

01:26:17.875 --> 01:26:19.332
What's wrong with her?

01:26:19.459 --> 01:26:22.250
Di, why does she sound
like that?

01:26:29.417 --> 01:26:34.042
Go and get help.
Find Miss G, find anybody!

01:27:00.667 --> 01:27:02.666
Thank God I found it.

01:27:03.917 --> 01:27:08.041
I'll take it from here, Radfield.
Go and find Miss Nieven at once.

01:27:21.667 --> 01:27:24.624
Everything is going to be all right.

01:27:24.750 --> 01:27:26.583
I'm here now.

01:27:51.542 --> 01:27:54.666
Please, please.

01:27:54.792 --> 01:27:56.390
Please.

01:28:07.625 --> 01:28:09.958
My beautiful child.

01:28:11.250 --> 01:28:13.000
My beautiful girl.

01:28:16.625 --> 01:28:19.624
I suppose you were not really meant
for this world.

01:28:22.292 --> 01:28:25.000
Go to sleep now.

01:28:25.125 --> 01:28:27.041
Go to sleep.

01:30:29.417 --> 01:30:31.791
We didn't mean it.

01:30:34.209 --> 01:30:36.416
We were just playing.

01:30:44.959 --> 01:30:46.874
What's going to happen, Di?

01:30:49.500 --> 01:30:53.374
Let's go and talk to Miss G.
Maybe she'll know what to do.

01:30:53.500 --> 01:30:56.458
We can tell her
we just wanted to give her a scare.

01:30:56.584 --> 01:30:59.666
Whatever we say, we did this.

01:30:59.792 --> 01:31:01.708
We're to blame.

01:31:02.959 --> 01:31:05.583
Please... stop.

01:31:12.625 --> 01:31:15.666
I have to tell you something.

01:31:45.959 --> 01:31:48.499
What can I do for you?

01:31:48.625 --> 01:31:52.791
I thought she was special.
Your favourite.

01:31:54.292 --> 01:31:56.041
Yes.

01:31:56.167 --> 01:31:57.834
It's a tragedy.

01:31:59.417 --> 01:32:01.249
But we shall move on.

01:32:01.375 --> 01:32:04.083
And we shall be as we once were,
a team.

01:32:10.667 --> 01:32:12.624
You don't deserve us.

01:32:22.542 --> 01:32:24.374
Is this a protest?

01:32:25.584 --> 01:32:28.083
You could have saved her.

01:32:28.209 --> 01:32:32.291
You need a scapegoat.
So, of course, it has to be me.

01:32:32.417 --> 01:32:33.624
Huh?

01:32:39.084 --> 01:32:41.083
You forget your part in this.

01:32:41.209 --> 01:32:43.792
Do you think you will be forgiven
for what you've done?

01:32:50.417 --> 01:32:52.833
We don't ask for forgiveness.

01:33:02.042 --> 01:33:07.584
Nothing will come of you now!
Your lights are extinguished!

01:33:18.084 --> 01:33:20.625
I appreciate your coming to see me,
Miss Radfield.

01:33:21.584 --> 01:33:25.124
We all feel we are in some way
to blame.

01:33:26.042 --> 01:33:30.542
But you must accept
that this was an act of God,

01:33:30.667 --> 01:33:34.998
and not allow rumour and hysteria
to tarnish this school's reputation.

01:33:39.042 --> 01:33:44.499
Miss Gribben will, however,
be taking a leave of absence

01:33:44.625 --> 01:33:46.915
to deal with this tragedy.

01:33:47.042 --> 01:33:49.999
Beyond that,
I consider this matter closed.

01:34:31.750 --> 01:34:36.873
"Dear team. Please don't be cross
with me for leaving you in the lurch."

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:40.124
"There is no place here for me now."

01:34:40.250 --> 01:34:42.208
"And I feel with great certainty"

01:34:42.334 --> 01:34:45.166
"that I must chance
to make a discovery of my own."

01:34:47.875 --> 01:34:51.333
"I'm not sure I will come across
elephants or crocodiles immediately,"

01:34:53.667 --> 01:34:56.541
"but I shall write and tell you
the minute I do."

01:35:08.250 --> 01:35:10.999
"You must look after each other now"

01:35:11.125 --> 01:35:14.874
"and do your best
to be fearless and true."

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.208
"Carry these notions
forth into the world,"

01:35:17.334 --> 01:35:20.333
"because without you
they will simply disappear."

01:35:24.875 --> 01:35:28.584
"Don't fret.
I will write soon and..."

01:35:28.709 --> 01:35:32.291
"PS: I promise to replace
the shortbreads."

01:35:33.417 --> 01:35:35.166
"Love, Di."
