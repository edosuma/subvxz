03:02.815 --> 03:06.118
God, I am so sorry.
I had no idea
what that was going to be.

03:06.120 --> 03:07.920
No, no, really,
it is okay.

03:07.922 --> 03:10.856
Oh! How can people stand
to watch that kind of crap?

03:12.859 --> 03:17.763
Probably permanently damaged
your opinion of us
as a race, as a town.

03:19.632 --> 03:21.867
No, really,
it is all new to me.

03:21.869 --> 03:23.635
I'm happy to see it.

03:32.078 --> 03:33.845
- Wonderful performance.
- Thank you.

03:33.847 --> 03:36.014
Really great.

03:36.016 --> 03:38.116
Come on.
We got to be to work
in an hour.

03:48.294 --> 03:51.763
Ugh!
I have totally failed
in my duty as a host.

03:51.765 --> 03:54.099
I'll make it up to you,
though, I promise.

03:54.101 --> 03:56.768
We'll give you a real
California welcome yet.

03:56.770 --> 03:58.070
Listen to this.

03:59.239 --> 04:04.843
"The actor is in
a wretched state,

04:04.845 --> 04:08.513
"exploited like
a prostitute.

04:08.515 --> 04:10.549
"But just..."

04:12.518 --> 04:14.620
You really liked it?

04:14.622 --> 04:18.589
Yeah. I thought
it was very free.

04:18.591 --> 04:21.226
It was that.

04:21.228 --> 04:24.196
Sit, sit, please.

04:24.198 --> 04:27.633
This is your home now too.
I want you to feel that way,
okay?

04:27.635 --> 04:29.234
Thank you.
That's very kind.

04:29.236 --> 04:31.069
Can I pick you anything up
on my way home?

04:31.071 --> 04:34.406
Except cigarettes.
I won't participate
in a suicide.

04:34.408 --> 04:35.941
Hmm.

04:35.943 --> 04:38.477
Um, no, thank you.
It's fine.

04:38.479 --> 04:40.345
What time do you have
to be there tomorrow?

04:40.347 --> 04:41.913
9:00.

04:42.382 --> 04:43.649
You nervous?

04:44.684 --> 04:48.353
Uh, I'm prepared.

04:51.524 --> 04:55.661
I know I keep saying this,
but I'm glad you're here.

04:59.499 --> 05:00.832
Thank you.

05:58.858 --> 06:00.425
Hey!

06:02.762 --> 06:03.929
Hey!

06:05.064 --> 06:07.032
Hey! Hey!

06:16.409 --> 06:17.609
Aah!

06:23.950 --> 06:25.951
I kick your ass, dude!

06:43.837 --> 06:47.239
Osman. Holy shit.
Joseph. Joseph kidd.

06:47.241 --> 06:49.040
Oh, good to be
finally meeting you.

06:49.042 --> 06:50.342
I'm honored, truly.

06:50.344 --> 06:52.878
Sierra, this man is a hero.

06:52.880 --> 06:54.980
Really?
What did you do?

06:54.982 --> 06:57.616
Nothing, I don't know...
I can't believe you're here!

06:57.618 --> 06:59.084
I just have to ask.

06:59.786 --> 07:01.753
Are you okay?

07:01.755 --> 07:04.556
Yes, I'm fine.
"Fine." Christ.

07:04.558 --> 07:08.059
What a world, right?
You ever see
such a sleepy newsroom?

07:08.061 --> 07:10.762
Look alive, people.

07:10.764 --> 07:15.300
This man spent half his life
reporting from a war zone.

07:15.302 --> 07:18.837
Dodging bullets while you
were slapping at flies.

07:20.541 --> 07:23.508
Seriously, you're all over
Gabe's piece for the <i> time.</i>

07:23.510 --> 07:25.777
Great work.
Heart-stopping shit.

07:25.779 --> 07:29.881
Well, I... I was mostly
just arranging travel for him

07:29.883 --> 07:32.584
and interpreting
for him on that.

07:32.586 --> 07:34.152
So...

07:34.154 --> 07:37.222
Well, pull that chair up
and close that door,
will you?

07:40.426 --> 07:42.427
Okay.

07:42.429 --> 07:44.296
What can I do for you?

07:44.298 --> 07:46.765
First, I want
to thank you again.

07:46.767 --> 07:49.267
To you, to Gabe,
i say thanks.

07:49.269 --> 07:50.902
Of course, of course.

07:52.071 --> 07:54.473
I'm still coming up
with ideas,

07:54.475 --> 08:00.078
but I thought maybe
i could start
with early impressions.

08:00.080 --> 08:04.883
Maybe the first day in town,
or something short
about the play.

08:04.885 --> 08:06.718
The play?
Of course, that's not all.

08:06.720 --> 08:09.955
It's just to begin.
Part of a whole series.

08:09.957 --> 08:12.724
But everything is so new.
It's so very bright
in my mind.

08:12.726 --> 08:13.792
Very strong.

08:13.794 --> 08:15.327
Okay.
Yes.

08:15.329 --> 08:16.695
Did you... did you go?

08:16.697 --> 08:18.597
Uh...
Gloria took me,

08:18.599 --> 08:20.165
and she didn't know
what it was.

08:20.167 --> 08:22.200
But it was ecstatic.

08:22.202 --> 08:24.469
The actors were working
very hard,

08:24.471 --> 08:27.138
doing tasks
i didn't understand,
but still work,

08:27.140 --> 08:31.576
hard work of some kind,
and they were
speaking Polish.

08:31.578 --> 08:34.980
I don't know why,
but there was a man
and a machine,

08:34.982 --> 08:37.249
and the man was nude
with a hat.

08:37.251 --> 08:38.783
And it was...

08:39.485 --> 08:40.919
Very American.

08:40.921 --> 08:43.989
That sounds insane.
Yes.

08:43.991 --> 08:46.791
But I think it could be
a good first assignment.

08:46.793 --> 08:50.228
A first... wait.
Yeah.
Again, that's just one idea.

08:50.230 --> 08:53.265
I know I sound very vague,
but I have to tell you,

08:53.267 --> 08:55.300
I'm very nervous...

08:56.636 --> 09:00.171
Because I'm just
very grateful to you...

09:00.173 --> 09:01.773
Oh, shit.

09:01.775 --> 09:06.378
Did Gabe tell you
i could give you a job?

09:07.413 --> 09:08.713
Yes.

09:09.649 --> 09:11.650
Oh, Jesus.

09:12.718 --> 09:15.287
This is embarrassing.

09:15.289 --> 09:16.788
Well, I don't have to write
about the play.

09:16.790 --> 09:19.824
No, no, no, I...
I think you misunderstand.

09:19.826 --> 09:21.359
There's no money.

09:21.361 --> 09:24.296
But I thought...
I'm sorry, man.

09:24.298 --> 09:28.133
There's really nothing.

09:38.210 --> 09:39.544
Okay.

09:40.479 --> 09:42.180
Thank you for your time.

09:44.317 --> 09:47.018
Oh, wait. The blotter.

09:47.020 --> 09:50.255
I can give you 50 bucks a week
to write a police blotter.

09:51.257 --> 09:53.058
What's a police blotter?

10:02.168 --> 10:03.568
<i> "July 28.</i>

10:03.570 --> 10:07.072
"Sebastopol resident
Ben Dewey, 17,

10:07.074 --> 10:10.075
"was apprehended

10:10.077 --> 10:13.011
"for wild boars

10:13.013 --> 10:15.080

"she was able to board

10:38.137 --> 10:40.905
"Valiant." I like it.

10:40.907 --> 10:42.974
I don't even know
what this is.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.509
You don't have to do it.

10:44.511 --> 10:47.412
He tell me to just use
the police report.

10:47.414 --> 10:50.982
You don't even
have to leave the house.

10:50.984 --> 10:55.987
I can't sit around copying
reports for $50 a week.
I need to do something.

11:01.527 --> 11:02.861
What?

11:04.397 --> 11:08.600
I know it sounds silly,
but before,

11:08.602 --> 11:11.202
when I'm thinking
of the California,

11:12.138 --> 11:14.205
it looked different
in my mind.

11:14.207 --> 11:16.307
What, like big tits
and sand?

11:25.919 --> 11:27.285
I'm close. I got it.

11:57.950 --> 11:59.784
What are we doing here?

11:59.786 --> 12:02.587
I'll be just a minute.
You stay here in the car.

12:51.037 --> 12:53.471
I don't want to have
to deal with him again!

12:54.373 --> 12:56.508
I don't want
to deal with it!

12:56.510 --> 12:58.443
No, but I don't want him
in the house!

12:58.445 --> 13:00.011
Come on, come on,
come on!

13:00.013 --> 13:01.613
He's not in the house now,
all right?

13:01.615 --> 13:02.814
He's not in the house now.

13:02.816 --> 13:04.115
No!

13:05.685 --> 13:07.852
I don't want him here anymore!
Where are you headed, maddie?

13:07.854 --> 13:09.954
I don't want him
in this house!
Where are you headed?

13:09.956 --> 13:12.590
I don't want him
in this house!
I know...

13:12.592 --> 13:14.526
I don't want him
in this house anymore!

13:16.295 --> 13:18.997
No! I want him out!

13:18.999 --> 13:20.465
Okay, okay...

13:20.467 --> 13:22.300
They're pushing him around...

13:22.302 --> 13:23.601
Who are you?

13:23.603 --> 13:24.969
It was just your boy here?

13:24.971 --> 13:27.372
No! No!
There were no people here!
Huh?

13:27.374 --> 13:28.840
I'm a...

13:29.441 --> 13:31.543
Reporter.

13:31.545 --> 13:34.012
I can't do it!

13:34.014 --> 13:35.513
Reporter?

13:36.749 --> 13:38.416
From where?

13:38.418 --> 13:39.851
I can't do it! I can't do it!

13:40.186 --> 13:41.553
No!

13:43.422 --> 13:44.923
No!

13:44.925 --> 13:47.592
You come all the way
from somewhere to see me?

13:48.961 --> 13:51.563
Oh, I'm with Gloria.

13:51.565 --> 13:53.398
- They were here!
- Maddie, who was here?

13:53.400 --> 13:55.700
Were there other people here?
There was other people here?

13:55.702 --> 13:57.368
Yeah, is she going
to take her?

13:57.870 --> 14:00.405
I don't know.

14:00.407 --> 14:01.773
Yeah, she got
to take her.

14:02.575 --> 14:04.809
She needs some
authority, man.

14:04.811 --> 14:05.977
She's mad.

14:07.379 --> 14:09.480
Maybe
you should report that,

14:09.482 --> 14:11.015
then maybe someone will...

14:13.152 --> 14:15.553
What's that accent?

14:15.555 --> 14:18.223
You said where you were from,
but I... I forgot.

14:18.225 --> 14:20.992
Oh, here she comes.

14:20.994 --> 14:22.594
- Here she comes.
- Whoa! Whoa!

14:22.596 --> 14:23.795
Huh? Huh?
Whoa! Whoa!

14:23.797 --> 14:26.331
Oh, now she's a penitent!

14:26.333 --> 14:29.500
A minute ago she's doling out
some weak-ass sub-ninja shit

14:29.502 --> 14:31.269
with a kitchen knife,
and now look at her.

14:31.271 --> 14:32.704
Lindsay, would you just
calm down.

14:32.706 --> 14:33.938
Fuck that.

14:33.940 --> 14:36.074
Osman, could you please
get back to the car?

14:36.076 --> 14:38.443
Yeah, I can take care
of myself, mama!
Please, I asked you to stay...

14:38.445 --> 14:39.811
Hey!

14:41.180 --> 14:42.847
Calm down now, huh?
Okay, it's me.

14:42.849 --> 14:45.617
Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey!

14:45.619 --> 14:47.418
Whoa! Easy!

14:47.420 --> 14:49.387
Take that,
foreign correspondent!

14:49.389 --> 14:50.989
Lindsay, let him go!

14:50.991 --> 14:53.258
Oh, come on, glor! Come on!
Let him go!

14:53.260 --> 14:54.626
Ah, fuck it!

14:55.728 --> 14:57.996
Fuck it!
You okay, mama?

14:57.998 --> 14:59.564
Huh?

15:00.232 --> 15:02.967
You okay? Huh?

15:02.969 --> 15:06.037
He hurt you? Did he hurt you?
Are you okay?

15:06.039 --> 15:07.705
You going to be
all right, maddie?

15:10.210 --> 15:13.311
Why don't you guys go in
and get some rest, all right?

15:13.313 --> 15:16.648
To the car.
To the car.

15:16.650 --> 15:18.683
- Hey. Mr. reporter man.
- Don't turn back.

15:18.685 --> 15:21.052
Just walk. Just walk.
If you report any of this,
i will kill you.

15:22.621 --> 15:24.656
Come on, come on.

15:25.424 --> 15:28.126
Up, up, up, up, up.

15:28.128 --> 15:29.761
All right, all right.

15:41.540 --> 15:43.441
Let's see,
what do we got here?

15:44.076 --> 15:45.209
Let me see.

15:46.111 --> 15:48.646
Back home,
if she had brothers,

15:48.648 --> 15:50.214
they would go
to his house tomorrow

15:50.216 --> 15:51.783
and they would put him
in the ground.

15:53.118 --> 15:55.753
Nah, Lindsay's not bad
when he's not high.

15:58.190 --> 15:59.724
And when he is,

15:59.726 --> 16:03.027
he's a truly
impressive magnet for
heartache and trouble.

16:04.697 --> 16:07.598
The man can build
a damn fine hot tub.

16:08.968 --> 16:12.070
Finds all the wood
himself.

16:12.072 --> 16:16.708
Yes, well,
i don't think it is talent
to find wood in the forest.

16:20.346 --> 16:21.980
He'll apologize to you.

16:28.087 --> 16:31.055
Hey, osman.

16:31.057 --> 16:32.824
What?

16:34.059 --> 16:35.827
I like you.

16:35.829 --> 16:37.996
I wasn't sure at first.

16:37.998 --> 16:41.065
But it's nice
to see you angry.

16:43.802 --> 16:46.904
Hey, no heroics
in the future.

16:48.807 --> 16:50.742
We can take care
of ourselves.

16:51.443 --> 16:52.977
Good night.

17:09.428 --> 17:12.296
Police blotter?
That fucker.

17:12.298 --> 17:13.564
<i> I'm not complaining.</i>

17:13.566 --> 17:16.300
<i> I'm just...</i>
Deferent as hell
when I called.

17:16.301 --> 17:17.801
"Yeah, sure, Gabe.
Anything you need.

17:17.804 --> 17:21.439
"Your piece
in the <i> times magazine</i>
tore my heart out."

17:21.441 --> 17:23.540
I'll bet he didn't even
read it.

17:23.542 --> 17:25.343
Oh, he read it.

17:25.345 --> 17:29.514
It tore his heart out.
He wanted very much
to make sure that I was okay.

17:29.516 --> 17:31.516
You going to go crazy
over there, man?

17:31.518 --> 17:33.084
<i> Look, I got a few friends</i>
<i> in New York that can...</i>

17:33.086 --> 17:36.587
No, Gabe.
I'm not going to go crazy.

17:36.589 --> 17:38.556
<i> Not if...</i>
Not if you have
something to do.

17:40.360 --> 17:42.827
Not if I have
something to do.

17:42.829 --> 17:44.629
The market,
airport road.

17:44.631 --> 17:45.797
Osman, I got to go.

17:45.799 --> 17:47.398
Your understudy's
giving me the eye.

17:48.233 --> 17:50.134
Yeah, I think, uh...

17:50.136 --> 17:52.103
I think your mother
wants to talk to you.

17:52.105 --> 17:53.805
<i> I'd rather not, buddy.</i>

17:53.807 --> 17:56.974
It's easier not dealing
with her fretting over me,
if you know what I mean.

17:56.976 --> 18:00.545
Look, stay strong.
You're a badass, man.
You're a fixer, huh?

18:00.547 --> 18:03.481
<i> California can't possibly</i>
<i> defeat you, huh?</i>

18:03.483 --> 18:05.750
<i> Own it, brother. You know?</i>
<i> You hear what I'm saying?</i>

18:05.752 --> 18:06.884
<i> Own it.</i>

18:08.487 --> 18:09.554
Gabe?

18:14.460 --> 18:16.160
He had to go to work.

18:17.396 --> 18:18.663
I'm going to go get
some cigarettes.

18:18.665 --> 18:20.631
Can I get you anything?
Where is he?

18:20.633 --> 18:22.433
I haven't heard
from him since...

18:26.004 --> 18:27.605
It's a mile-and-a-half
away.

18:36.115 --> 18:37.181
Hello.

18:37.816 --> 18:39.283
May I help you?

18:39.285 --> 18:40.384
Yes, a pack of reds, please.

18:43.088 --> 18:44.555
Don't think we have those.

18:47.759 --> 18:48.826
Uh...

18:49.895 --> 18:51.629
Okay.

18:51.631 --> 18:57.268
Is there a grown person
i could talk to here?

18:59.004 --> 19:00.571
No?
There a problem?

19:00.573 --> 19:01.973
Ah, yes.

19:06.211 --> 19:09.046
I don't think
she can reach the cigarettes.

19:10.449 --> 19:11.749
Oh, dear.

19:12.451 --> 19:13.985
Brand?

19:13.987 --> 19:15.319
Reds, please.

19:16.822 --> 19:18.789
Just these, lace,
and the cigarettes.
Thank you.

19:18.791 --> 19:20.091
No...

19:20.993 --> 19:22.527
Shut up.

19:32.271 --> 19:33.838
Thank you
for the cigarettes.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.640
Oh, yeah.
No worries.

19:37.142 --> 19:41.145
I've been recently told
that I have to own it,
and...

19:41.147 --> 19:43.681
Uh-huh?

19:43.683 --> 19:46.217
I think that means
i should talk to you.

19:48.153 --> 19:50.188
Um, what are you
supposed to own?

19:54.293 --> 19:55.626
I have no idea.

19:58.063 --> 19:59.397
Okay.

19:59.399 --> 20:01.165
I'm Sandra, by the way.

20:01.167 --> 20:04.202
Sandra. Osman.

20:04.204 --> 20:06.771
I like that.
Where are you from?

20:08.840 --> 20:11.442
Carl, we're going
to the beach.

20:11.444 --> 20:13.110
Are we?
Uh-huh.

20:13.112 --> 20:15.513
This is osman.
He's from Afghanistan,

20:15.515 --> 20:17.815
and he hasn't seen
the water yet.

20:17.817 --> 20:20.184
Also, he really dug
your play.

20:21.486 --> 20:22.987
Well, then,

20:22.989 --> 20:24.488
we'll go to the beach.

20:29.595 --> 20:31.696
So, osman...

20:32.998 --> 20:34.599
Yes?

20:34.601 --> 20:35.900
What are you doing in my Van?

20:36.735 --> 20:38.169
I don't know.

20:38.171 --> 20:39.971
Yet.

20:39.973 --> 20:41.205
You don't know yet.

20:45.010 --> 20:46.911
So, you worked with Gabe?

20:46.913 --> 20:49.280
Yeah, I was his fixer. We...

20:49.282 --> 20:50.581
Like an interpreter?

20:51.149 --> 20:52.450
Yes.

20:54.319 --> 20:58.656
In Afghanistan, it is all
about the relationships.

20:58.658 --> 21:01.726
A journalist
cannot walk around

21:01.728 --> 21:04.395
the country
just asking the questions.

21:04.397 --> 21:05.863
You need a guide.

21:05.865 --> 21:09.667
Yeah. Someone who know
how to read the place.

21:09.669 --> 21:13.137
A kind of cultural translator.
Yeah, exactly.

21:13.139 --> 21:14.472
So, what happened?

21:15.574 --> 21:17.041
I got the hell out.

21:18.610 --> 21:21.946
No, Gabe had a connection,
so I got lucky.

21:23.181 --> 21:24.682
Hey, Gabe
still helping you out?

21:27.152 --> 21:30.021
Yeah, I'm staying
with his mother,

21:30.023 --> 21:33.691
and thought
he find me a job, but...

21:33.693 --> 21:35.326
Really?

21:35.328 --> 21:36.894
Maybe it's stupid.

21:38.563 --> 21:40.398
The police blotter
for the newspaper.

21:41.466 --> 21:43.434
It isn't anything.

21:43.436 --> 21:45.369
Yeah, I know what it is.

21:45.371 --> 21:47.605
You'd like something
more substantial.

21:47.607 --> 21:49.073
Yes.

21:49.075 --> 21:50.941
Something that lets you
assert yourself,

21:50.943 --> 21:52.310
makes you feel like
a man.

21:53.612 --> 21:55.179
Something
that gives you dignity,

21:55.181 --> 21:57.782
"dignity" being kind of
a nebulous concept right now,

21:57.784 --> 22:00.184
since it's got
a different flavor over here

22:00.186 --> 22:03.754
than it did back home,
or seems to,

22:03.756 --> 22:07.658
but you're not sure,
because how do you know yet?

22:08.794 --> 22:10.161
That right?

22:13.765 --> 22:15.366
Well, it's just
that back home...

22:15.368 --> 22:17.301
No, don't tell us
too much.

22:17.803 --> 22:19.103
Not yet.

22:23.008 --> 22:24.375
Okay.

22:38.423 --> 22:40.491
Okay, fuck it.
I'm getting in!

22:57.376 --> 22:59.810
I'm happy
you bring me here, man.

23:01.614 --> 23:03.347
Osman, come on!

23:06.485 --> 23:08.185
Go ahead.

23:08.187 --> 23:09.520
I'll chaperone.

23:11.656 --> 23:13.257
Whoo!

23:13.725 --> 23:15.426
Hey, osman!

23:15.827 --> 23:17.094
Come on!

23:30.209 --> 23:31.642
You all right, buddy?

23:33.445 --> 23:34.845
Whoo-hoo!

23:38.483 --> 23:39.717
You okay?

23:41.987 --> 23:43.754
Thank you.
That better?

23:44.589 --> 23:45.956
Is he all right?

23:46.858 --> 23:48.025
He's fine!

23:56.669 --> 23:58.502
Osman!

24:01.373 --> 24:02.573
Whoo!

24:07.712 --> 24:09.079
Whoo!

24:17.789 --> 24:19.423
Gloria!

24:19.425 --> 24:20.991
Well, where have you been?

24:20.993 --> 24:22.426
The sea.

24:22.428 --> 24:24.395
I have been to the sea.

24:24.397 --> 24:25.629
You liked it.

24:25.631 --> 24:28.999
Oh, Gabe was right.
All I need
is something to do.

24:29.001 --> 24:30.634
Is that what he said?

24:30.636 --> 24:31.936
I'm going to take the job.

24:31.938 --> 24:33.671
What, the police blotter?
Yeah.

24:33.673 --> 24:36.307
I thought you said
you didn't want to sit around
writing reports.

24:36.309 --> 24:38.342
Exactly.
I don't need to wait

24:38.344 --> 24:40.077
for people to give
me things, right?

24:40.079 --> 24:43.214
I can go out
and actually do something.

24:43.216 --> 24:46.050
I'm going to use it
to meet this place,
the people,

24:46.052 --> 24:48.452
do real work
like Gabe and I did.

24:48.454 --> 24:50.654
Osman, what are you
talking about?

24:50.656 --> 24:54.124
I'm going to go out on patrol
with you, Afghan-style.

24:54.126 --> 24:55.259
Huh?

24:55.261 --> 24:58.062
I'm not just going to write
the police blotter,

24:58.064 --> 24:59.230
I'm going to do it.
Osman...

24:59.232 --> 25:01.398
Turn this bullshit job
into real work.

25:01.400 --> 25:03.400
Osman, you can't.

25:03.402 --> 25:06.804
You can't go out with me,
as delightful as you may be.

25:06.806 --> 25:10.441
But...
One, it's totally
against the rules.

25:10.443 --> 25:13.210
Last night...
And two, it interferes.

25:14.513 --> 25:16.847
I can't have you with me
out there when I'm working.

25:16.849 --> 25:18.582
I can't.
I... I wouldn't interfere.

25:18.584 --> 25:20.050
I'd be in the back...
No.

25:22.888 --> 25:24.121
I'm sorry.

25:26.191 --> 25:28.125
Here. Sit.

25:30.629 --> 25:32.830
It's the only thing
i can actually cook.

25:39.070 --> 25:42.072
You... you don't
need me to be here.

25:42.074 --> 25:44.108
You know that, right?

25:55.288 --> 25:57.054
<i> We should do the interview</i>
<i> when we're done this, right?</i>

25:57.056 --> 25:58.956
<i> Yeah, man. Yeah.</i>

25:58.958 --> 26:02.660
Many people say
the Taliban receive support

26:02.662 --> 26:04.962
from the
Pakistani government.

26:06.598 --> 26:09.433
Does the Taliban
receive support
from Pakistan?

26:09.435 --> 26:10.968
Come on.

26:39.197 --> 26:40.831
He's actually affirming

26:40.833 --> 26:43.233
that the Pakistani government
helps them,

26:43.235 --> 26:44.835
and did nothing
against them.

26:44.837 --> 26:47.304
They got many offices
at the border...
Hmm.

26:47.306 --> 26:49.740
...and that's how they operate
their operation.

26:49.742 --> 26:53.844
Right.
What is the structure?
Shit, man.

26:53.846 --> 26:56.747
That sounds like...
Like a detective aircraft.

26:56.749 --> 26:58.015
That sounds
like a detective aircraft.

27:01.120 --> 27:02.620
Should we go?
He's actually saying

27:02.622 --> 27:03.921
that it's
an American aircraft,

27:03.923 --> 27:05.389
so we should just
wrap things up.

27:05.391 --> 27:06.991
So, we should go?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

27:06.993 --> 27:08.392
Let's just wrap things up.
Tell him
thank you very much.

27:08.394 --> 27:09.526
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

27:17.569 --> 27:20.170
Go, man.

27:20.172 --> 27:21.605
Go!

27:24.976 --> 27:27.511
Oh, shit.

27:27.513 --> 27:29.079
Go, go, go!

27:29.581 --> 27:30.714
Go! Go! Move!

27:34.553 --> 27:36.153
Gabe?

27:53.004 --> 27:55.172
Whoo!

29:15.253 --> 29:17.721
Thank you.
No problem,
brother.

29:17.723 --> 29:20.257
Hey, foreign correspondent.

29:20.959 --> 29:22.626
You here to report me?

29:22.628 --> 29:25.162
I'm just fucking with you.

29:25.164 --> 29:27.464
I'm just messing around.
Come on, get in.

29:28.133 --> 29:30.167
Look, I owe you.

29:30.169 --> 29:34.471
That shit the other night,
my bad, all right?

29:34.473 --> 29:37.207
Serious misuse
of a sacred martial art.

29:37.209 --> 29:38.776
I own that.

29:38.778 --> 29:41.745
I apologize.
Come on.

29:41.747 --> 29:44.148
Man, I ain't going
to touch you.

29:44.150 --> 29:46.049
You sit on that side,
i sit on this side.

29:46.051 --> 29:47.951
Come on.

29:49.454 --> 29:51.789
All right,
it's cool.

30:01.499 --> 30:03.333
Man, no problem at all.

30:03.335 --> 30:05.235
No problem at all.
You just...

30:05.237 --> 30:08.071
Anywhere you want to go,
just say the word, brother.

30:08.073 --> 30:10.240
No, man, you'd be doing me
a favor.

30:10.242 --> 30:12.576
That karmic rebound.
Seriously.

30:12.578 --> 30:14.578
Where do you want to go?

30:15.313 --> 30:19.483
I have to go downtown.

30:19.485 --> 30:21.752
"Downtown" is kind of
a vague direction.

30:24.222 --> 30:27.491
Well, I...
I have work to do.

30:27.493 --> 30:28.959
Yeah?

30:28.961 --> 30:31.228
Something going on
i should know about?

30:31.230 --> 30:32.629
You got a scoop?

30:33.431 --> 30:35.332
No, no.

30:36.167 --> 30:37.734
Oh, yeah?

30:37.736 --> 30:39.837
So, what are you
working on?

30:42.106 --> 30:43.640
The police blotter.

30:43.642 --> 30:45.242
No shit?

30:45.244 --> 30:47.010
Fucking love it, man.

30:47.012 --> 30:48.812
First thing I read
every morning.

30:48.814 --> 30:50.480
Really?
Yeah.

30:50.482 --> 30:52.950
Love all that dirty
underbelly stuff.

30:52.952 --> 30:56.019
You know, the last dude that
wrote the blotter was stellar.

30:56.021 --> 30:58.188
Frankie the finger.
Frankie the finger, man.

30:58.190 --> 31:00.390
He wrote me up
a couple times.

31:00.392 --> 31:02.459
Yeah, but he had
the perfect tone, you know?

31:02.461 --> 31:05.262
Wry as a motherfucker.

31:05.264 --> 31:08.265
Like a laser beam,
you know?

31:08.267 --> 31:10.868
You got some... you got
some shoes to fill, my friend.

31:10.870 --> 31:12.769
I can fill
some shoes, man.

31:12.771 --> 31:15.439
I'll bet you can.

31:16.841 --> 31:18.275
So, the idea is what?

31:18.277 --> 31:21.245
You head into town,
do a little recon,

31:21.247 --> 31:23.647
pin the likely criminals,
and then you just hide out

31:23.649 --> 31:25.515
and wait for them
to do something nefarious?

31:25.517 --> 31:28.785
Something like recon.

31:29.754 --> 31:32.155
In this work, it's...

31:32.157 --> 31:34.958
It's all about finding
the source of things, yes.

31:34.960 --> 31:36.994
No shit?

31:36.996 --> 31:39.663
What's a dude from
Afghanistan doing out here

31:39.665 --> 31:41.932
in the this godforsaken
part of the country?

31:42.467 --> 31:43.934
Journalism.

31:44.903 --> 31:46.270
Afghan-style.

31:46.272 --> 31:48.205
Oh-ho!

31:48.207 --> 31:51.375
Ho! Well, you got
in the right car, brother.

31:51.377 --> 31:52.809
Right car.
Whoa!

31:54.113 --> 31:55.178
Oh!

31:56.915 --> 31:59.516
Stop it. Hey, stop.
Hey, man! What are you...

31:59.518 --> 32:01.285
Come on, man. Drive.

32:01.287 --> 32:03.220
Got the leg.

32:03.222 --> 32:05.255
That's a goddamn
tickle monster.

32:21.372 --> 32:24.174
It has to be
something dynamic.

32:24.176 --> 32:26.777
Present tense,
as Gabe liked to say.

32:26.779 --> 32:29.446
Something small that shows us
the bigger thing.

32:29.448 --> 32:31.682
Like a crime in progress.
Exactly.

32:31.684 --> 32:33.050
The moment after

32:33.052 --> 32:34.718
something terrible
has happened

32:34.720 --> 32:35.852
is very strange,
you know.

32:35.854 --> 32:39.623
There has been a...
A break in the life,

32:40.992 --> 32:43.226
a hole in the world.

32:43.228 --> 32:44.861
Does that make sense?
I can say it like this?

32:44.863 --> 32:47.631
Oh, yeah, man. Makes sense.
A hole in the world.

32:47.633 --> 32:49.232
Yeah.

32:49.234 --> 32:52.803
Sometimes you can see
inside of this hole.

32:55.206 --> 32:57.007
Sometimes you can't.

32:59.510 --> 33:01.111
All right, I got it.

33:01.113 --> 33:05.048
How about
you hide out in the...
In the apple orchard

33:05.050 --> 33:06.950
behind the snapple plant,

33:06.952 --> 33:09.820
wait for the cops to drag out
some petty crook out there

33:09.822 --> 33:11.455
and beat the crap
out of him.

33:11.457 --> 33:14.758
You write that shit up tight!
Tight!

33:17.195 --> 33:18.462
This really happened?

33:18.464 --> 33:20.030
Oh, yeah.

33:20.032 --> 33:22.366
Happened to a fucking friend
of mine from high school.

33:22.368 --> 33:24.167
Just made a little speed

33:24.169 --> 33:26.536
till they showed up one night
at his kitchen table,

33:26.538 --> 33:29.172
jacked his shit,
brought him out there,

33:29.174 --> 33:31.074
worked him over
into the fujis.

33:31.076 --> 33:33.844
Good, man.
That's good.

33:33.846 --> 33:36.179
Uh... what else you got?

33:37.782 --> 33:40.083
Well, there's
the sokurov brothers

33:40.085 --> 33:42.452
out in the
guerneville hills.

33:42.454 --> 33:44.388
The cops think
they're a bunch of freaks

33:44.390 --> 33:46.423
that are into
biodynamic gardening

33:46.425 --> 33:49.026
and making their own jam,
but truth be told,

33:49.028 --> 33:51.294
them's the dirtiest
fucking family

33:51.296 --> 33:53.230
since them gotti dudes.

33:53.232 --> 33:54.731
Except they're skinny
as little girls,

33:54.733 --> 33:56.800
and they shoot
their own meat.

33:57.735 --> 33:59.269
Hey, hey, hey.

33:59.271 --> 34:02.606
You got to quote that
"not for attribution," man.

34:02.608 --> 34:07.277
"'Skinny as little girls,'
said some unidentified
local craftsman."

34:09.213 --> 34:10.647
You said this is all about

34:10.649 --> 34:13.417
getting to the source
of things, right?

34:13.418 --> 34:14.784
Yeah.

34:16.154 --> 34:18.789
Yeah, downtown
ain't the place to start.

34:46.984 --> 34:48.618
Here we go.

34:50.855 --> 34:52.222
Ah.

34:53.858 --> 34:55.759
Uh, who lives here again?

34:55.761 --> 34:58.595
Oh, just old friends
of a sort.

34:58.597 --> 35:01.698
And what does this
have to do with anything?

35:01.700 --> 35:03.667
Oh, you know, man.
You got to...

35:03.669 --> 35:05.869
You're the blotter dude.
You got to meet the locals.

35:05.871 --> 35:08.572
You know,
get lay of the land,
all that, right?

35:08.574 --> 35:11.842
Plus, bro, she is going
to love you, man.

35:11.844 --> 35:13.210
She's going to love you,
all right?

35:13.212 --> 35:16.079
Just give me 10 minutes here
and we're done, all right?

35:16.081 --> 35:18.682
Come on, bro.
You and me, right?

35:18.684 --> 35:20.550
Right? Right?

35:20.552 --> 35:22.152
Right?
Okay, okay, okay.

35:22.154 --> 35:24.888
Hey.
Ha-ha!

35:24.890 --> 35:27.591
Ha-ha! Ho!

35:27.593 --> 35:29.960
All right, all right,
all right, all right, cool.

35:29.962 --> 35:32.329
Karen!

35:32.331 --> 35:34.331
Hey, I want you
to meet somebody.

35:34.333 --> 35:35.999
Hey, Dougie fresh.
Karen here?

35:36.001 --> 35:37.868
Lindsay!
Hey, Mario, man,

35:37.870 --> 35:38.969
I got to talk to her,
okay, bro?

35:38.971 --> 35:41.104
Come on, man.

35:41.106 --> 35:43.273
Yo, meet this guy.
This is osman.

35:43.275 --> 35:45.642
Hi. Hello.
Osman. I like that.

35:45.644 --> 35:47.978
You hungry?
Uh, no, thank you.

35:47.980 --> 35:50.680
Osman, meet my wife,
Suzie.

35:50.682 --> 35:52.315
Are you even
supposed to be here?
Hey, chill, bro.

35:52.317 --> 35:54.851
No, Doug, he most definitely
is not supposed to be here.

35:54.853 --> 35:57.287
This is Doug. Doug's mad
because he's grounded.

35:57.289 --> 35:58.822
Came home from school
drunk yesterday.

35:58.824 --> 36:00.357
Hey, two true statements,
douche bag.

36:00.359 --> 36:02.259
One, I was at school,
and two, I came home.

36:02.261 --> 36:04.161
Hey, Mario worked
for your paper, man.

36:04.163 --> 36:05.795
He does the local arts,
right?

36:05.797 --> 36:07.797
You work for the paper?
Police blotter.

36:07.799 --> 36:09.466
Oh, right. You're him.

36:09.468 --> 36:11.468
Afghanistan. Welcome.

36:11.470 --> 36:13.003
What happened
to Frankie the finger?

36:13.005 --> 36:15.472
The finger's gone, man.
O-man is in.

36:15.474 --> 36:17.474
We're taking this
to another level, right?

36:17.476 --> 36:19.242
Yo, we're partners now.
Right? Right?

36:19.244 --> 36:21.511
Well, I think...
Hey, where's she at, man?

36:21.513 --> 36:23.480
She upstairs?
She upstairs?

36:23.482 --> 36:25.182
Karen!

36:25.184 --> 36:28.885
Uh, well, I was planning on
expanding on the coverage...

36:28.887 --> 36:30.287
Oh, that's great,
because Mario here

36:30.289 --> 36:32.289
couldn't cover up a strip
of litmus paper with his dick.

36:32.291 --> 36:33.790
Hey, Doug,
that's just nonsense.

36:33.792 --> 36:34.858
Two quarters in the jar.

36:34.860 --> 36:36.493
Hey, Mario, can...
Can I go upstairs?

36:36.495 --> 36:37.694
I wouldn't
if I were you.

36:37.696 --> 36:40.297
Fuck, man.

36:40.299 --> 36:41.998
You look like a retarded
boy scout right now.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.067
Doug, I happen to look
like your father.

36:44.069 --> 36:46.436
Hey, osman, what would
happen in Afghanistan

36:46.438 --> 36:48.171
if a kid spoke to
his father this way?

36:48.173 --> 36:49.339
Yeah, tell him.

36:49.341 --> 36:50.807
Well, he would be in trouble.

36:50.809 --> 36:53.410
He'd be in trouble.

36:53.412 --> 36:55.879
- Hi. Karen, hi.
- What are you doing here?

36:55.881 --> 36:57.047
What are you doing here,
Lindsay?

36:57.049 --> 36:58.815
Well, I thought I'd come by
and say hi...

36:58.817 --> 37:00.617
No, you can't just
come by and say hi anymore...

37:00.619 --> 37:02.552
I know, I know.
What the hell, guys?

37:02.554 --> 37:04.621
- No one said anything?
- I did.

37:04.623 --> 37:06.289
Hi.
And who the fuck are you?

37:06.291 --> 37:07.724
I'm osman.
Osman.

37:07.726 --> 37:10.360
Wonderful to be finally
meeting you, truly.
Yeah.

37:10.362 --> 37:13.396
Lindsay, he say the most
beautiful things about you.

37:13.398 --> 37:14.931
Yeah.
Lindsay.

37:14.933 --> 37:16.700
What?
Oh, my god.

37:16.702 --> 37:19.102
- Wait, Karen.
- What? What?

37:19.104 --> 37:21.504
- You have to go now.
- No, no.

37:21.506 --> 37:23.506
Look, I wanted
to introduce you.

37:23.508 --> 37:25.709
This guy is legit, okay?

37:25.711 --> 37:28.245
I'm working with him
and I thought, you know,

37:28.247 --> 37:31.414
maybe you could put in
a little word for me,
you know?

37:31.416 --> 37:32.983
Right?

37:32.985 --> 37:35.619
I'm sorry. I am.
Why?

37:35.621 --> 37:37.220
But I called Gary
when I saw you pull up.

37:37.222 --> 37:40.857
Oh, no. Why?
Why would you do that?

37:40.859 --> 37:43.760
You should take the back door.
Gary's going to be mad.

37:43.762 --> 37:45.428
- Lindsay?
- What?

37:45.430 --> 37:47.230
- We should go right now.
- Oh, man!

37:47.232 --> 37:49.065
Nice meeting you.
What?
You sent some people?

37:49.067 --> 37:51.301
What the hell, Karen?

37:51.303 --> 37:54.337
Still put in a word.
You can still do that, right?

37:55.740 --> 37:57.073
Hey, listen...

38:13.157 --> 38:14.658
Whoo!

38:31.676 --> 38:33.310
Lindsay!

38:40.117 --> 38:41.651
Lindsay!

38:57.568 --> 38:59.202
Lindsay.

39:01.439 --> 39:03.039
<i> Police blotter.</i>

39:03.041 --> 39:05.275
<i> Notes for September 6th.</i>

39:05.277 --> 39:07.377
<i> 5:15 P.M.</i>

39:07.379 --> 39:10.613
<i> Two men in the woods,</i>

39:10.615 --> 39:15.018
<i> One wild man with glasses,</i>
<i> one skinny and mean.</i>

39:15.020 --> 39:18.688
<i> One unstable family,</i>
<i> one pig butchered indoors.</i>

39:18.690 --> 39:21.224

39:21.226 --> 39:23.660

39:23.662 --> 39:26.863
<i> One woman,</i>

39:26.865 --> 39:29.265

39:48.619 --> 39:50.220
The...

39:51.389 --> 39:55.325
Unidentified...

39:56.761 --> 39:59.996
Local craftsman.

40:04.969 --> 40:07.203
What happened to you?

40:07.205 --> 40:08.371
I went to work.

40:13.944 --> 40:16.980
You were right, Gloria.
Yeah?

40:16.982 --> 40:19.149
I don't need you
to be here.

40:35.966 --> 40:39.269
Hello? Lindsay?

40:39.271 --> 40:41.738
It's the foreign
correspondent man.

40:41.740 --> 40:43.072
We have to talk.

41:36.060 --> 41:37.961
Get down! Down!

42:00.985 --> 42:02.585
Jesus Christ.

42:10.094 --> 42:12.061
Come on, Lindsay.
Everybody knew him.

42:12.063 --> 42:14.163
Not me, man.
Not me, man.

42:14.165 --> 42:15.565
I don't consort
with that kind of...

42:15.567 --> 42:17.333
You saw him yesterday.

42:17.335 --> 42:20.937
From a distance.
From a distance, man.

42:20.939 --> 42:23.706
Yeah? You talk to him?
You talk to anybody else?

42:23.708 --> 42:26.442
No, I didn't talk...
I wasn't there for anybody.

42:26.444 --> 42:28.244
I was there
for a little face time

42:28.246 --> 42:29.779
with my ex-old lady, man.

42:29.781 --> 42:31.447
This is insane.

42:39.189 --> 42:41.257
- Fucking bullshit! Fucking...
- Lindsay, wait.

42:41.259 --> 42:42.892
Lindsay.
Oh, man.

42:42.894 --> 42:44.928
Just get back, brother.
You don't want
any of this shit on you!

42:44.930 --> 42:46.863
Lindsay, what's going on?
Who was that man?

42:46.865 --> 42:48.932
Just a fucking Minion, man!
They get them to chase you

42:48.934 --> 42:50.033
and then they're fucking...
Who?

42:50.035 --> 42:52.502
Who does?
Just... fuck, man!

42:52.504 --> 42:54.037
I take one little drop

42:54.039 --> 42:56.239
out of their whole ocean
of fucking dirty scratch,

42:56.241 --> 42:58.107
and then
the fucking world ends.

42:58.109 --> 42:59.375
God damn it!

42:59.377 --> 43:00.810
You tell Gloria
he was chasing you?

43:00.812 --> 43:03.246
You think I'm going
to fucking tell the cops, man?

43:03.248 --> 43:05.682
It's three grand.
Not even four grand.

43:05.684 --> 43:07.784
Fuckers will put you down
for nothing, man.

43:07.786 --> 43:09.018
They put you under
for nothing!

43:09.020 --> 43:10.386
So, maybe
i don't understand,

43:10.388 --> 43:12.388
but I think your reaction
to this is a bit too strong.

43:12.390 --> 43:15.692
Two... two... two hundred
fucking yards
from my house, man.

43:15.694 --> 43:17.193
The fuckers are on me.

43:17.195 --> 43:19.562
Lindsay, you're not making
the complete sense
right now.

43:19.564 --> 43:24.000
Look, man, even if that was
a fucking accident,

43:24.002 --> 43:25.635
they're going to think
i had something to do with it.

43:25.637 --> 43:28.404
And they're going
to come at me hard.

43:28.406 --> 43:31.641
This is bad, man.
Very fucking bad!

43:33.210 --> 43:34.310
Fuck it!

43:35.879 --> 43:38.314
Listen to me.
Listen to me.

43:38.316 --> 43:41.050
I can help you, okay?

43:41.052 --> 43:42.619
I can help you,
but you have to tell me

43:42.621 --> 43:44.354
what it is that's going on.

43:46.624 --> 43:48.858
Look, you go home.

43:48.860 --> 43:50.760
I'll talk to Gloria,
see what she knows,

43:50.762 --> 43:52.729
and then you and I,
we can sit down,

43:52.731 --> 43:55.231
talk through this
and figure it out, okay?

43:56.100 --> 43:57.867
We can fix this.

44:00.037 --> 44:01.204
Promise?

44:02.039 --> 44:03.873
I promise.

44:05.743 --> 44:07.276
All right.

44:29.867 --> 44:31.100
Gloria.

44:31.102 --> 44:32.769
Not now, osman.
I got to run.

44:32.771 --> 44:35.238
Uh... uh...

44:36.874 --> 44:38.908
You want to come with me?

44:38.910 --> 44:40.777
Yeah.

44:40.779 --> 44:42.378
Yeah, hop in.

45:03.133 --> 45:04.801
Did you know the man?

45:04.803 --> 45:06.335
The dead guy?

45:06.337 --> 45:08.538
Not especially.

45:08.540 --> 45:11.474
His name was beaux.
With an x.

45:14.344 --> 45:16.379
It's cold in here.

45:18.215 --> 45:19.916
How do you think
he was killed?

45:19.918 --> 45:22.418
Hit and run, probably.

45:22.420 --> 45:24.387
So, what
are we doing here?

45:25.556 --> 45:28.725
Lindsay tell you
anything about him?

45:28.727 --> 45:30.259
I don't know what you...

45:31.829 --> 45:34.397
Yesterday.
You were with him, right?

45:34.399 --> 45:37.900
You see this guy?
Lindsay say anything
about him?

45:37.902 --> 45:40.570
No, nothing like that.

45:42.005 --> 45:44.140
He seen me on the side
of the road,

45:44.875 --> 45:46.809
gave me a ride downtown.

45:50.214 --> 45:53.883
He also apologized
for beating me.

45:57.354 --> 45:59.789
I imagine you've seen
a lot of this.

46:00.924 --> 46:02.225
A lot of death.

46:03.527 --> 46:04.927
Yes.

46:05.929 --> 46:07.663
With Gabe?

46:08.365 --> 46:10.500
Yes, sometimes.

46:12.836 --> 46:15.738
I don't imagine
it ever gets dull, does it?

46:16.273 --> 46:18.341
No, it doesn't.

46:23.514 --> 46:25.515
But this can make you
very tired.

46:31.588 --> 46:33.222
You asked what we were
doing here.

46:34.024 --> 46:36.325
Well, I have no idea.

46:38.262 --> 46:40.696
All I know is our dead guy
worked for people

46:40.698 --> 46:45.268
who are capable
of some truly unsavory things.

46:45.270 --> 46:47.970
And when someone
close to people like that

46:47.972 --> 46:49.472
ends up dead
by the side of the road,

46:49.474 --> 46:52.642
it kind of makes you want
to take a walk in the woods,

46:52.644 --> 46:54.544
if you know what I mean.

46:54.546 --> 46:56.379
So, who did he work for?

46:56.381 --> 46:58.548
A couple of guys
in the guerneville hills.

46:58.550 --> 47:01.350
Brothers, actually.
The sokurovs.

47:01.352 --> 47:03.719
You know, that kid
keeps torching the mailboxes,

47:03.721 --> 47:07.423
I am 90% sure
he's one of theirs.

47:07.425 --> 47:12.128
Word is one brother
actually set the other
on fire over a woman.

47:12.130 --> 47:13.963
Never could prove it,
though.

47:16.567 --> 47:17.900
Osman?

47:49.601 --> 47:51.567
This...

47:51.569 --> 47:54.737
This death must be
a very strange thing

47:54.739 --> 47:56.339
for this town.

47:56.341 --> 47:58.741
Osman...

47:58.743 --> 48:01.410
You're lovely,
but with all due respect,

48:03.113 --> 48:06.549
you couldn't possibly know
what's strange for this town.

48:48.992 --> 48:50.626
Lindsay?

48:52.663 --> 48:54.664
Lindsay?

49:16.253 --> 49:19.288
I just come
to talk to Lindsay.

49:22.460 --> 49:25.061
Stop! Stop! Stop!
No! Stop! Stop!

49:25.063 --> 49:27.296
Please! No!

49:28.999 --> 49:30.499
Where's Lindsay?

49:32.903 --> 49:34.003
He's gone.

49:36.506 --> 49:38.240
<i> She said... she said</i>
<i> they took him.</i>

49:38.242 --> 49:40.343
Who?
<i> Won't say.</i>

49:40.345 --> 49:42.545
Or doesn't know.

49:42.547 --> 49:44.113
<i> Is his truck there?</i>
What?

49:44.115 --> 49:46.048
His truck.
Do you see it?

49:46.050 --> 49:48.284
No, but...
<i> Okay, then.</i>

49:48.286 --> 49:50.486
Let's not jump
to conclusions.

49:50.488 --> 49:52.655
I mean, for all we know,
he could be on a beer run

49:52.657 --> 49:54.023
<i> or halfway</i>
<i> to Tahoe by now.</i>

49:54.025 --> 49:55.391
He said he'd be here.

49:55.393 --> 49:59.962
This is who they are, osman.
Unreliable.

49:59.964 --> 50:03.399
<i> Look, I'll be by</i>
<i> as soon as I can.</i>

50:03.401 --> 50:05.301
<i> Probably find him passed out</i>
<i> on the lawn.</i>

50:05.303 --> 50:07.336
Well, I hope you do.

50:07.338 --> 50:09.538
<i> And what the hell</i>
<i> are you doing</i>
<i> over there, anyway?</i>

50:09.540 --> 50:11.807
Actually, never mind that.

50:11.809 --> 50:16.112
Just go home and let us
take care of it our way, okay?

50:18.348 --> 50:19.515
<i> Okay?</i>

50:20.350 --> 50:22.218
Yeah, okay.

50:22.220 --> 50:23.786
Good.

50:25.122 --> 50:26.856
Are they coming?

50:33.430 --> 50:35.031
Can I borrow that?

52:15.966 --> 52:17.800
<i> Police blotter.</i>

52:17.802 --> 52:19.401
<i> September 8.</i>

52:20.604 --> 52:23.072
<i> A man is dead</i>
<i> on the side of the road.</i>

52:25.342 --> 52:27.343
<i> A hole has opened</i>
<i> in the earth.</i>

52:56.106 --> 52:57.173
Osman!

52:58.208 --> 53:00.442
Everybody, this is osman.

53:02.412 --> 53:04.480
Let's move them
into the plastiques.

53:09.052 --> 53:11.287
And don't get sucked
into patterns.

53:11.289 --> 53:14.690
Honest impulse, clear action.

53:14.692 --> 53:17.026
The forest run's next,
people.

53:19.829 --> 53:21.263
You look beat.

53:29.773 --> 53:31.874
What does Gloria say
about all this?

53:33.844 --> 53:35.911
She says nothing
means anything yet.

53:35.913 --> 53:38.080
And she's right.

53:38.082 --> 53:40.182
What, you think Lindsay
brained some guy with a rock

53:40.184 --> 53:43.052
and then got whisked away
by the big weeping dude?

53:43.054 --> 53:46.088
No. I have no idea.
That's the problem.

53:46.090 --> 53:48.023
You know, I'm a crime reporter
who doesn't know

53:48.025 --> 53:50.259
if a crime is actually
being committed.

53:51.895 --> 53:54.730
You have asylum here,
right?

53:54.732 --> 53:57.132
Which means you can never
go home, right?

53:57.134 --> 53:58.601
Not even for a visit.

53:59.936 --> 54:03.072
And if you do, that's it.
They revoke your status.

54:03.074 --> 54:04.907
Say you must not be in danger
in your home country

54:04.909 --> 54:06.442
if you choose to go back,
even for a week.

54:06.444 --> 54:07.710
Why are you asking me this?

54:07.712 --> 54:10.079
It seems like a lot
of pressure, that's all.

54:11.081 --> 54:12.648
I'm not quite sure what...

54:12.650 --> 54:15.417
I don't agree
with Gloria on much,
but she's right on this.

54:15.419 --> 54:18.454
First off,
Lindsay's mom is not well.

54:18.456 --> 54:20.256
And Lindsay,
he's a total disaster,

54:20.258 --> 54:21.957
but incapable of violence.

54:22.826 --> 54:24.593
You said it yourself.

54:24.595 --> 54:27.997
Nothing else, the man knows
how to run from danger.

54:27.999 --> 54:30.032
He is very quick.

54:30.034 --> 54:32.701
He freaked out
and left town.

54:32.703 --> 54:35.671
Or he's down at red's
recovery room getting tanked.

54:35.673 --> 54:38.474
He'll turn up.
He always does.

54:38.476 --> 54:41.110
Even when people
wish he wouldn't.

54:41.112 --> 54:43.779
What about... oh! Oh! Oh!

54:47.183 --> 54:49.985
Why don't you hang out
for a while?

54:49.987 --> 54:51.186
We're having
a little gathering

54:51.188 --> 54:52.821
at the house
after we finish up.

54:55.892 --> 54:58.360
And what about
the sokurovs?

54:58.362 --> 55:01.964
What about them?
They're a whole family
of assholes.

55:01.966 --> 55:05.034
But assholes from guerneville,
not assholes from kandahar.

55:07.772 --> 55:10.239
Yeah,
you got to relax, osman.

55:10.241 --> 55:12.675
Come on.
It'll be good for you.

55:12.677 --> 55:13.909
So, you think I'm crazy?

55:13.911 --> 55:15.411
Yes, I do.
Okay.

55:26.189 --> 55:27.556
<i> Osman.</i>

55:27.558 --> 55:30.125
Gloria, how are you?

55:30.127 --> 55:31.327
You all right?

55:31.329 --> 55:32.528
<i> Yes, I'm fine.</i>

55:32.530 --> 55:34.396
<i> I'm just checking in.</i>

55:34.398 --> 55:36.332
Why are you whispering?

55:36.334 --> 55:39.401
They are doing something.

55:40.036 --> 55:42.037
Okay.

55:42.039 --> 55:46.542
Yeah. I just wanted to see
if you've been over
to Lindsay's.

55:46.544 --> 55:49.278
<i> Yeah, yeah,</i>
<i> everything's fine.</i>

55:49.280 --> 55:50.746
You see Lindsay?

55:50.748 --> 55:53.182
<i> No, not yet, but we will.</i>

55:53.184 --> 55:55.284
<i> Talked to maddie.</i>

55:55.286 --> 55:58.253
Okay, I just
want to make sure...

55:58.255 --> 56:01.590
Osman, I'm telling you,
everything is fine.

56:01.592 --> 56:03.125
There's nothing
to worry about,

56:03.960 --> 56:05.094
all right?

56:09.666 --> 56:10.999
Osman?

56:12.235 --> 56:13.669
Okay, thank you.

56:13.671 --> 56:14.837
Thank you very much.

56:31.888 --> 56:33.555
Watch this.

56:33.557 --> 56:34.623
Feel it.

56:35.892 --> 56:37.760
Sense the roots
under your feet.

56:45.969 --> 56:47.436
And now.

56:51.708 --> 56:54.309
Whoa.

57:31.080 --> 57:33.048
I want to feel your heart.

57:47.297 --> 57:49.164
You enjoying yourself?

57:50.500 --> 57:52.634
Everyone is very nice.

57:52.636 --> 57:55.637
The bearded man wanted
to touch my heart.

58:00.311 --> 58:03.111
But I don't know if
I'm in the mood for a party.

58:03.113 --> 58:05.714
Are you still worried
about Lindsay?

58:07.350 --> 58:08.617
Carl told me.

58:11.688 --> 58:13.222
I don't know.

58:14.157 --> 58:15.791
Maybe.

58:17.861 --> 58:19.795
Where is Carl, anyway?

58:24.501 --> 58:28.237
Man gets stoned
and has to exercise.

58:28.239 --> 58:31.306
No, honestly,
it's like you smoke
one joint at a concert

58:31.308 --> 58:33.809
and next thing you know
he's doing one-armed push-ups

58:33.811 --> 58:35.410
on the dance floor.

58:37.580 --> 58:39.581
It does not have
that same effect on me.

58:39.583 --> 58:41.683
Fuck no. He's mad.

58:45.722 --> 58:47.656
You're with Carl, right?

58:51.794 --> 58:53.462
Why do you ask?

58:55.298 --> 58:57.299
I was just...

58:57.301 --> 58:58.901
I didn't know if...

58:58.903 --> 59:00.869
We're in
an open relationship.

59:02.105 --> 59:06.675
We stay open to each other,
and open to the world.

59:08.678 --> 59:10.212
I see.

59:16.320 --> 59:17.686
What?

59:17.688 --> 59:19.388
- Nothing.
- What?

59:25.094 --> 59:27.262
Can I ask you something?

59:27.264 --> 59:28.630
Yeah.

59:30.233 --> 59:32.100
What was it like
over there?

59:34.771 --> 59:38.640
It's funny,
i spent my whole life
trying to leave,

59:38.642 --> 59:40.475
not because
i was always in danger

59:40.477 --> 59:41.810
like people here imagine,

59:41.812 --> 59:44.279
but because I got it
stuck in my head

59:44.281 --> 59:47.616
that life started
somewhere else.

59:47.618 --> 59:51.887
Like you had to get out
to have a chance
at really living.

59:51.889 --> 59:53.956
America, Europe,
wherever.

59:56.025 --> 59:59.461
Don't get me wrong.
The danger was real.

01:00:03.633 --> 01:00:05.300
I don't know.
Like...

01:00:07.003 --> 01:00:10.238
This one time,
i went to visit my aunt.

01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:12.507
She lived
in an apartment above

01:00:12.509 --> 01:00:15.544
the massoud monument
in Kabul.

01:00:15.546 --> 01:00:17.512
I knock on her door,
and boom.

01:00:18.781 --> 01:00:20.649
I run in,

01:00:20.651 --> 01:00:24.519
and she's on the balcony
doing her laundry.

01:00:25.855 --> 01:00:27.155
Only, her windows
are gone

01:00:27.157 --> 01:00:29.658
and she's got
two pieces of glass

01:00:29.660 --> 01:00:32.160
sticking out of her back
like wings.

01:00:32.162 --> 01:00:33.395
So, I run toward her.

01:00:33.397 --> 01:00:36.098
She's bleeding,
but strangely she seems okay.

01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:38.300
So, I look out and I see

01:00:38.302 --> 01:00:39.501
there's something
in the tree.

01:00:39.503 --> 01:00:42.070
We're three floors up,
so it's at eye level.

01:00:42.072 --> 01:00:44.573
And it's a foot and an
ankle still in the shoe.

01:00:44.575 --> 01:00:45.774
And down below,

01:00:45.776 --> 01:00:48.176
there's a Humvee
split in half,

01:00:48.178 --> 01:00:50.779
and there's
an American soldier
bent into the shape

01:00:50.781 --> 01:00:52.648
only dead people make.

01:00:53.383 --> 01:00:54.816
It's a woman.

01:00:54.818 --> 01:00:56.084
I can tell,
because her helmet's

01:00:56.086 --> 01:00:57.252
been blown off.

01:00:58.454 --> 01:01:01.056
And there's
a cigarette seller

01:01:01.058 --> 01:01:03.892
with his little pushcart,
and they're both on fire.

01:01:03.894 --> 01:01:06.228
And people are trying
to put him out,

01:01:06.230 --> 01:01:08.363
but he keeps running
and running.

01:01:08.365 --> 01:01:09.798
And there's bits of cars

01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:11.867
and people
in trees everywhere.

01:01:11.869 --> 01:01:13.802
So, I run down to help,

01:01:13.804 --> 01:01:16.938
throwing people in taxis
or whatever will take them.

01:01:16.940 --> 01:01:19.207
And I grab this one guy,

01:01:19.209 --> 01:01:21.476
and his leg
comes right off.

01:01:21.478 --> 01:01:23.845
Just separates
from his body.

01:01:27.417 --> 01:01:28.884
So, I toss it
in the car with him,

01:01:28.886 --> 01:01:31.219
and on to the next
and the next.

01:01:32.989 --> 01:01:36.958
And, uh,
when it was all over,

01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:40.128
I didn't feel
anything at all.

01:01:42.832 --> 01:01:48.203
Just the adrenaline
and heat.

01:02:06.823 --> 01:02:09.624
But it wasn't like that
all the time.

01:02:11.928 --> 01:02:13.795
It was regular life.

01:02:19.535 --> 01:02:21.970
You'd be surprised
what you get used to, yeah?

01:02:27.944 --> 01:02:29.678
Well, you're here now.

01:02:30.546 --> 01:02:32.380
Yeah.

01:02:32.382 --> 01:02:34.082
You're safe.

01:02:35.485 --> 01:02:37.753
I didn't come here
just to be safe.

01:02:41.057 --> 01:02:42.557
Good.

01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:45.327
Yeah.

01:03:27.337 --> 01:03:29.871
They can hear you
in the next county!

01:03:30.940 --> 01:03:32.307
I like this song,

01:03:32.309 --> 01:03:35.777
but for me the song
by the American

01:03:35.779 --> 01:03:39.447
with the voice like rocks,
that is the best song.

01:03:40.416 --> 01:03:42.450
What is it called?
No idea.

01:03:42.452 --> 01:03:44.119
Oh, yes, yes.

01:03:59.369 --> 01:04:01.269
Hey, osman,
i was thinking

01:04:01.271 --> 01:04:03.438
about the conversation
we had this afternoon.

01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:04.973
Lindsay and the sokurovs
and all that.

01:04:04.975 --> 01:04:06.875
Oh, god, Dmitri sokurov.

01:04:06.877 --> 01:04:08.210
My friend,
now is not the time

01:04:08.212 --> 01:04:09.444
to talk about these things.

01:04:09.446 --> 01:04:11.580
Now is the time
only for dancing!

01:04:11.582 --> 01:04:13.849
I lived
on the sokurov property

01:04:13.851 --> 01:04:18.253
for, like,
four months in this killer
converted chicken Coop.

01:04:18.255 --> 01:04:21.556
But the kids, man,
they'd spy on me masturbating.

01:04:21.558 --> 01:04:22.691
It was freaky.

01:04:22.693 --> 01:04:24.292
But seriously,

01:04:24.294 --> 01:04:25.760
I was swimming laps
and I couldn't stop

01:04:25.762 --> 01:04:28.196
thinking about it.

01:04:28.198 --> 01:04:29.564
I mean,
he comes all this way,

01:04:29.566 --> 01:04:33.101
and ends up trailing Lindsay
around west county.

01:04:33.103 --> 01:04:34.536
I mean, what's up with that,
right?

01:04:34.538 --> 01:04:35.904
I had to get out of there.

01:04:35.906 --> 01:04:39.107
Their teenager threatened
to light my junk on fire.

01:04:39.109 --> 01:04:42.310
And then I realized,
he's a journalist.

01:04:42.312 --> 01:04:43.979
That's what they do.

01:04:44.714 --> 01:04:46.014
Yeah.

01:04:46.016 --> 01:04:47.515
I think you're great, osman,

01:04:47.517 --> 01:04:50.018
but it's a dark profession,
isn't it?

01:04:50.020 --> 01:04:51.453
I mean, at its core?
Carl...

01:04:51.455 --> 01:04:53.455
No, no, it's fine.

01:04:53.457 --> 01:04:56.024
Um... yeah.

01:04:56.893 --> 01:05:00.829
Yeah, there are some
problem things

01:05:00.831 --> 01:05:02.130
about it sometimes.

01:05:02.132 --> 01:05:04.799
Yes, problem things.

01:05:04.801 --> 01:05:06.067
Like what?
Hey, Carl, come on.

01:05:06.069 --> 01:05:07.469
Now you're just being
an asshole.

01:05:07.471 --> 01:05:12.040
Well, sometimes
the journalist gets it wrong.

01:05:12.842 --> 01:05:15.210
Or lies.

01:05:15.212 --> 01:05:18.146
Or sometimes he doesn't care
about the people.

01:05:18.148 --> 01:05:20.682
Only the story.
Exactly.

01:05:20.684 --> 01:05:23.885
They go somewhere,
find a person who embodies

01:05:23.887 --> 01:05:27.155
what they already think
about a place,

01:05:28.491 --> 01:05:30.725
then milk them for drama.

01:05:30.727 --> 01:05:32.861
Leave the dead, empty skin
by the side of the road

01:05:32.863 --> 01:05:34.129
and on to the next.

01:05:34.797 --> 01:05:37.165
I think Sandra is right.

01:05:37.167 --> 01:05:39.467
Now you are being
the asshole.

01:05:39.469 --> 01:05:42.437
It's true!
I am an asshole!

01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:47.042
A great big,
fleshy asshole.

01:05:48.477 --> 01:05:51.012
I'm just kidding, osman.
I'm trying to make a point.

01:05:51.014 --> 01:05:52.547
Don't listen to him, osman.

01:05:52.549 --> 01:05:54.316
He's just jealous
because he never got to prove

01:05:54.318 --> 01:05:56.217
his manhood in the shit.

01:06:00.056 --> 01:06:02.257
Here, let me show you
how to use that.

01:06:14.704 --> 01:06:16.438
If we listen
to one another,

01:06:18.407 --> 01:06:21.242
if we read each other's
intentions clearly,

01:06:21.244 --> 01:06:23.111
then no one
will come to harm.

01:06:24.915 --> 01:06:26.681
I...
Shh! No talking.

01:06:26.683 --> 01:06:28.650
Just listen and react.

01:06:31.253 --> 01:06:33.521
Carl!
What? What is it, baby?

01:06:33.523 --> 01:06:35.090
All right, you guys,
let's bring it in.

01:06:35.092 --> 01:06:36.791
Seriously, osman,
it's not worth it.

01:06:36.793 --> 01:06:39.227
Both of you, chill.
They're so
worried about you.

01:06:39.229 --> 01:06:40.462
Carl, let's sleep it off.

01:06:40.464 --> 01:06:42.263
I said quiet!

01:06:42.265 --> 01:06:43.732
Oh, my god!

01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:46.301
Carl...

01:06:46.303 --> 01:06:47.969
Carl, you okay, man?

01:06:51.975 --> 01:06:54.209
He's fine. Come on.

01:06:56.379 --> 01:06:57.912
You deserved it.

01:07:01.917 --> 01:07:03.351
Is he all right?

01:07:03.353 --> 01:07:05.220
Couldn't be happier.

01:07:06.889 --> 01:07:09.958
Um, hey, do you mind
staying here tonight?

01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:11.926
It's a little late
to drive you home.

01:07:11.928 --> 01:07:13.561
Yes, thank you.

01:07:18.968 --> 01:07:20.368
You okay?

01:07:22.071 --> 01:07:23.805
I want to know you all.

01:07:24.340 --> 01:07:25.607
Know this place.

01:07:25.609 --> 01:07:27.308
But I'm doing it wrong.
I can tell.

01:07:28.377 --> 01:07:30.378
There's no right way
or wrong way.

01:07:30.913 --> 01:07:33.815
Just be here.

01:07:35.918 --> 01:07:39.454
I left too many people behind
to just be here.

01:07:41.424 --> 01:07:43.191
It has to mean
something.

01:07:44.293 --> 01:07:45.393
Osman, I...

01:07:45.395 --> 01:07:46.694
It's okay.

01:07:54.403 --> 01:07:56.971
You have to know a place
to live in it.

01:07:59.008 --> 01:08:01.910
You have to dig in,
find the center.

01:08:05.481 --> 01:08:07.282
How can I live here
if I can't see

01:08:07.284 --> 01:08:08.950
the bottom of things?

01:08:10.352 --> 01:08:12.887
Maybe that's not
your job anymore.

01:08:16.091 --> 01:08:17.892
Then what's my job?

01:08:21.964 --> 01:08:23.932
I don't know.

01:08:32.341 --> 01:08:33.774
Not now.

01:09:27.830 --> 01:09:29.397
Lindsay.

01:09:37.907 --> 01:09:39.774
I got it. Uh-huh.

01:09:40.943 --> 01:09:42.277
Uh-huh.

01:09:42.810 --> 01:09:43.877
Gloria.

01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:45.412
Not now.

01:09:46.247 --> 01:09:48.082
Wait, I'm coming with you.

01:09:51.953 --> 01:09:54.322
Just stay here,
and I'll be back
as soon as I can.

01:09:54.324 --> 01:09:55.690
What is it?
What is happening?

01:09:55.692 --> 01:09:57.692
Nothing, just stay here.

01:09:57.694 --> 01:10:00.595
Gloria, I promised...
Stay here!

01:10:09.872 --> 01:10:11.773
<i> Police blotter.</i>

01:10:11.775 --> 01:10:14.475
<i> Notes for September 12th.</i>

01:10:14.477 --> 01:10:16.744
<i> The hot tub man</i>
<i> is in danger,</i>

01:10:16.746 --> 01:10:20.014
<i> but I can help him</i>
<i> before he comes to harm.</i>

01:10:20.016 --> 01:10:21.416
<i> I am certain of this,</i>

01:10:21.418 --> 01:10:23.918
<i> even if I am certain</i>

01:10:25.354 --> 01:10:28.122
<i> Sometimes you can see</i>

01:10:29.258 --> 01:10:31.125
<i> and sometimes you can't.</i>

01:11:04.893 --> 01:11:06.794
I know what you did.

01:11:06.796 --> 01:11:09.197
Wait. No.

01:11:09.798 --> 01:11:11.299
No, wait!

01:14:06.241 --> 01:14:09.210
Gloria, I...
I have to tell you...

01:14:09.212 --> 01:14:10.578
We found his truck.

01:14:12.448 --> 01:14:14.615
Underwater.

01:14:14.617 --> 01:14:17.618
Somebody dumped it
in the old reservoir.

01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:19.287
Is he...

01:14:19.289 --> 01:14:20.688
Osman.

01:14:21.857 --> 01:14:24.859
Whatever you know,
you have to tell me.

01:14:44.213 --> 01:14:45.713
That his?

01:14:57.793 --> 01:14:59.760
You went pretty far in.

01:15:00.729 --> 01:15:02.396
He was chasing me.

01:15:02.398 --> 01:15:04.932
It was self-defense, osman.

01:15:04.934 --> 01:15:07.034
Whatever you did,
it's all right.

01:15:28.156 --> 01:15:29.957
It was right here.

01:15:52.247 --> 01:15:54.749
You okay?

01:15:54.751 --> 01:15:57.552
Part of me wishes
we would have found him there.

01:15:58.320 --> 01:16:00.221
In the ground.

01:16:00.223 --> 01:16:04.158
Christ, that's not what
you tell the cops.

01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:05.560
Come with me
back to the station.

01:16:05.562 --> 01:16:07.161
You stay out of sight.

01:16:07.163 --> 01:16:09.330
I'll send the boys out
to track down Gary,

01:16:09.332 --> 01:16:10.998
drag him in for assault.

01:16:13.001 --> 01:16:15.870
Meanwhile, I'm back out
to the reservoir.

01:16:20.309 --> 01:16:23.544
But look, not finding Gary
out there

01:16:23.546 --> 01:16:25.346
is a good thing, okay?

01:16:28.450 --> 01:16:31.218
You said they didn't find
his body in the truck, right?

01:16:31.220 --> 01:16:32.887
Who?
Lindsay.

01:16:32.889 --> 01:16:34.288
No, no body.

01:16:34.290 --> 01:16:36.691
There are traces of blood
all over the thing.

01:16:36.693 --> 01:16:38.225
Some on the steering wheel,

01:16:38.227 --> 01:16:40.795
some on the grill,
on the door.

01:16:40.797 --> 01:16:42.063
Stop the car.

01:16:42.065 --> 01:16:43.164
What?

01:16:43.166 --> 01:16:46.067
Please stop the car. Stop.

01:16:46.668 --> 01:16:48.069
Where are you going?

01:16:48.071 --> 01:16:50.171
I need to walk.
Where?

01:16:53.008 --> 01:16:55.309
I... I'll call you
if I need you!

01:18:08.216 --> 01:18:10.251
Any word on Gary yet?

01:18:10.253 --> 01:18:12.987
Nope.

01:18:12.989 --> 01:18:16.190
Martin says they finished
the work on the truck, though.

01:18:16.192 --> 01:18:18.025
Says it's all from
the same guy.

01:18:19.127 --> 01:18:20.428
What is?

01:18:20.430 --> 01:18:21.796
The blood.

01:18:21.798 --> 01:18:23.164
From the truck?

01:18:23.665 --> 01:18:24.732
Inside and out.

01:18:24.734 --> 01:18:27.201
Your rock?
It's all the same.
Same guy.

01:18:28.370 --> 01:18:29.937
Lindsay?

01:18:29.939 --> 01:18:31.439
The other one. The...

01:18:31.441 --> 01:18:32.840
The dude
in the ditch.

01:18:34.242 --> 01:18:35.342
What was his name?

01:18:36.344 --> 01:18:37.511
Beaux.

01:18:38.113 --> 01:18:39.380
That's it.

01:18:56.065 --> 01:18:57.665
Uh, you want to come in?

01:18:59.401 --> 01:19:01.268
Where's Lindsay?

01:19:01.270 --> 01:19:02.470
What do you mean?

01:19:02.472 --> 01:19:04.605
The day he disappeared,
no one come for him.

01:19:05.407 --> 01:19:06.841
I think he left on his own.

01:19:08.210 --> 01:19:09.910
You should go now.
No!

01:19:12.013 --> 01:19:13.981
Where is Lindsay?

01:19:13.983 --> 01:19:15.683
I don't know.

01:19:15.685 --> 01:19:19.286
He hurt that man, didn't he?
But no one come for him, huh?

01:19:19.288 --> 01:19:20.921
I don't know
what you're talking about!

01:19:20.923 --> 01:19:22.156
Where is Lindsay?

01:19:22.158 --> 01:19:24.225
He's under the sea,
isn't he?

01:19:24.227 --> 01:19:25.326
Maddie.

01:19:25.328 --> 01:19:27.261
They told me
that's where he lives now.

01:19:32.367 --> 01:19:35.302
Who? Who tell you that?

01:19:35.304 --> 01:19:37.471
I don't know.
The police.

01:19:37.473 --> 01:19:40.141
Dmitri. Everybody.

01:19:40.143 --> 01:19:42.076
Can I help you,<i> mi amigo?</i>

01:19:51.853 --> 01:19:54.221
You tell Lindsay
I'm looking for him.

01:19:55.891 --> 01:19:57.658
You tell him
i know what he did.

01:20:10.505 --> 01:20:12.072
Hey, man.

01:20:12.074 --> 01:20:14.175
You know the hot tub man,
Lindsay, yes?

01:20:14.177 --> 01:20:16.177
<i> Yeah, yeah, we used to go</i>
<i> to high school together.</i>

01:20:16.179 --> 01:20:17.378
He was being hunted.

01:20:17.380 --> 01:20:19.146
They found
his truck underwater.

01:20:19.148 --> 01:20:21.615
<i> Wait, what?</i>
He owed the sokurovs money.

01:20:21.617 --> 01:20:23.884
I think it's
for his business.
I don't know.

01:20:23.886 --> 01:20:26.053
But he was in trouble
and now he's gone.

01:20:26.055 --> 01:20:28.989
<i> They were chasing him,</i>
<i> but now the man is dead.</i>

01:20:35.063 --> 01:20:37.298
What? What is it?
<i> If he hurt someone,</i>

01:20:37.300 --> 01:20:39.200
<i> there had to be a reason,</i>
<i> right?</i>

01:20:39.202 --> 01:20:40.634
<i> There had to be</i>
<i> a reason.</i>

01:20:40.636 --> 01:20:43.070
<i> Hell, I don't know.</i>
<i> He's a wild man.</i>

01:20:43.072 --> 01:20:45.372
<i> A little bit like you and me,</i>
<i> I guess.</i>

01:20:45.374 --> 01:20:46.574
How do you mean?

01:20:46.576 --> 01:20:49.910
Well, on one hand
he's got a sense of humor,

01:20:49.912 --> 01:20:51.111
on the other
he's got a little bit

01:20:51.113 --> 01:20:52.913
of a death wish thing
happening, you know?

01:20:52.915 --> 01:20:55.749
If I had that wish anymore
you think I'd be here?

01:20:57.485 --> 01:20:59.587
What about the soku...

01:20:59.589 --> 01:21:00.788
<i> Wait.</i>

01:21:02.290 --> 01:21:03.824
I got to go.

01:21:06.428 --> 01:21:08.095
Shit.

01:21:12.801 --> 01:21:14.101
Hey.

01:21:14.103 --> 01:21:16.103
Hey, kid.

01:21:16.105 --> 01:21:18.606
No, no, no!
I just want to talk!

01:21:18.608 --> 01:21:19.840
Please stop.

01:21:23.912 --> 01:21:25.212
Oh, shit.

01:21:57.412 --> 01:22:00.681
Let go of me!
My dad's going to kill you!

01:22:47.696 --> 01:22:49.430
You come to pay
your respects?

01:22:51.634 --> 01:22:54.234
It's an honor to be invited,
don't you think?

01:23:34.409 --> 01:23:36.243
Sorry, I...

01:23:37.545 --> 01:23:39.046
Get off the property.

01:23:39.481 --> 01:23:40.647
Dmitri.

01:23:41.916 --> 01:23:43.851
You should see your face.

01:23:43.853 --> 01:23:45.386
Dmitri sokurov?

01:23:47.188 --> 01:23:49.990
Yes, sir.
What can I do for you?

01:23:49.992 --> 01:23:53.460
You the Afghan pushed
the little guy off his bike?

01:23:53.462 --> 01:23:55.429
That's my sole heir, sir.

01:23:56.364 --> 01:23:57.798
So far, anyways.

01:24:01.136 --> 01:24:02.870
What the hell?

01:24:02.872 --> 01:24:04.138
I need to talk to you.

01:24:04.140 --> 01:24:05.506
Well, that's great.
I need to talk to you, too.

01:24:05.508 --> 01:24:07.908
Don't go cross-checking
my kid into ditches.

01:24:10.046 --> 01:24:12.913
Let's go talk about this
somewhere privately, huh?

01:24:12.915 --> 01:24:16.050
These people don't need
to hear our petty shit.

01:24:16.052 --> 01:24:18.018
- Hey.
- Oh, stop it.

01:24:18.020 --> 01:24:20.821
Why the hell is everybody
so serious?

01:24:22.023 --> 01:24:23.490
Come on.

01:24:24.359 --> 01:24:25.426
Come on.

01:24:29.164 --> 01:24:32.966
Money? That's what
you want, yeah?

01:24:32.968 --> 01:24:35.402
- What's happening here?
- Oh, that's Ingrid.

01:24:35.404 --> 01:24:37.171
Sister-in-law.

01:24:37.173 --> 01:24:38.806
Why don't you
say hello to...

01:24:38.808 --> 01:24:41.742
Sorry, what is it?
From Afghanistan.

01:24:41.744 --> 01:24:43.243
Can you beat it?

01:24:43.245 --> 01:24:45.112
My uncle fought
over there.

01:24:45.114 --> 01:24:47.214
Called it a war
for a piece of shit.

01:24:49.118 --> 01:24:50.918
He didn't feel like
he could speak his mind

01:24:50.920 --> 01:24:53.287
for most of his life,
but let me tell you,

01:24:53.289 --> 01:24:56.056
when he finally did,
it was like the dam broke.

01:24:56.058 --> 01:24:57.224
Where is Lindsay?

01:24:57.226 --> 01:24:59.693
I'm going to give you
100 just to be safe.

01:24:59.695 --> 01:25:01.328
I haven't bought
a mailbox in years,

01:25:01.330 --> 01:25:03.363
so what do I know?
Do you hear me?

01:25:05.100 --> 01:25:06.300
Did I hear you?

01:25:06.302 --> 01:25:08.769
If he has debts,
i will help pay.

01:25:08.771 --> 01:25:10.604
I have money
from back home,

01:25:10.606 --> 01:25:12.272
money I make
as journalist, okay?

01:25:12.274 --> 01:25:14.508
Yeah.
I don't want that.

01:25:14.510 --> 01:25:16.477
Oh, come on, sir.

01:25:16.479 --> 01:25:18.011
Typical immigrant, right?

01:25:18.013 --> 01:25:19.613
All earnest fucking pride.

01:25:19.615 --> 01:25:22.583
I want to go home.
Oh, shut up!

01:25:22.585 --> 01:25:25.018
I can't... I can't deal
with you right now!

01:25:25.020 --> 01:25:26.453
Don't talk to her
like that.

01:25:27.889 --> 01:25:29.389
Is this your house?

01:25:30.525 --> 01:25:32.526
Huh?

01:25:32.528 --> 01:25:34.695
Do... do you know Ingrid?

01:25:34.697 --> 01:25:37.264
Because if you
knew Ingrid...
I know Lindsay...

01:25:37.266 --> 01:25:39.366
You know what?
You know what?
You know what?

01:25:40.735 --> 01:25:44.271
See, Ingrid was in a fire
with my brother,

01:25:44.273 --> 01:25:46.073
and ever since then
she's been a little bit...

01:25:46.075 --> 01:25:47.674
But you can't condescend.

01:25:51.012 --> 01:25:52.412
Let's go.

01:25:52.414 --> 01:25:57.017
Go, go, go and see
what's going on
up there, huh?

01:25:57.019 --> 01:26:00.187
I don't... I don't have
the stomach for it.

01:26:00.189 --> 01:26:03.524
But that fucking midwife,
let me tell you, she's good.

01:26:03.526 --> 01:26:06.126
I know that Lindsay...

01:26:06.128 --> 01:26:08.395
He ran down
one of your men, yes?

01:26:08.397 --> 01:26:09.696
Killed him?

01:26:09.698 --> 01:26:11.532
Finished him off
with a rock, I think?

01:26:11.534 --> 01:26:13.600
Maybe he meant
to do this thing,
maybe he didn't.

01:26:13.602 --> 01:26:15.369
I don't know.
But he was afraid.

01:26:15.371 --> 01:26:17.538
I see it in him,
believe me.

01:26:17.540 --> 01:26:18.672
He was afraid
when he did it,

01:26:18.674 --> 01:26:19.973
and he was afraid
when he ran.

01:26:19.975 --> 01:26:21.775
I know this.

01:26:21.777 --> 01:26:24.378
And when his truck
went in the water,
he wasn't in it.

01:26:25.813 --> 01:26:27.147
So, where is he?

01:26:28.183 --> 01:26:29.616
You tell me.

01:26:31.219 --> 01:26:32.753
Why do you care?

01:26:32.755 --> 01:26:34.955
I owe him.
He needs me.

01:26:34.957 --> 01:26:36.657
Where is he?

01:26:36.659 --> 01:26:38.358
I'm sorry.
Nobody fucking needs you.

01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:39.426
Where is he?

01:26:42.530 --> 01:26:44.932
Why should anybody
tell you anything?

01:26:48.236 --> 01:26:49.403
Is he dead?

01:26:50.004 --> 01:26:51.538
Dmitri!

01:26:54.943 --> 01:26:56.109
Is he?

01:26:56.111 --> 01:26:59.680
You need to calm down,
Afghanistan.

01:27:00.848 --> 01:27:03.584
Everybody dies, right?

01:27:04.152 --> 01:27:05.719
Everybody dies.

01:27:16.531 --> 01:27:19.066
Oh, man.

01:27:19.068 --> 01:27:21.835
You... you should see
your face.

01:27:41.723 --> 01:27:43.523
Don't worry
about it, bro.

01:29:06.341 --> 01:29:08.008
You're right
about most of it.

01:29:09.377 --> 01:29:12.212
And Lindsay will have to pay
for what he did to beaux.

01:29:13.915 --> 01:29:16.149
But you don't really know us,
do you?

01:29:19.921 --> 01:29:21.855
We take care of our own.

01:29:24.625 --> 01:29:27.327
And here, everything
is always forgiven.

01:29:37.004 --> 01:29:39.373
Now would be a good time
for you to leave.

01:29:51.352 --> 01:29:52.586
Lindsay.

01:29:53.588 --> 01:29:56.757
Hey, foreign correspondent.

01:29:56.759 --> 01:29:58.558
What are you
doing here, man?

01:29:58.560 --> 01:29:59.893
Uh...

01:30:02.263 --> 01:30:04.264
I had to go away
for a little while.

01:30:06.167 --> 01:30:08.568
But, uh, Dmitri said
i could come back.

01:30:09.937 --> 01:30:11.671
I came back.

01:30:13.207 --> 01:30:15.575
Hey, it's all right,
you know?

01:30:16.544 --> 01:30:18.678
Yeah, yeah,
it's going to be fine.

01:30:18.680 --> 01:30:20.213
I just got to...

01:30:20.215 --> 01:30:22.315
You know, I just got
to help him out a little bit.

01:30:22.317 --> 01:30:26.019
But he said...
You know, he said

01:30:26.021 --> 01:30:27.788
everything's
going to be fine.

01:30:30.024 --> 01:30:31.558
Why?

01:30:31.560 --> 01:30:32.793
What?

01:30:32.795 --> 01:30:34.294
Why'd you do it?

01:30:40.234 --> 01:30:41.468
Ah...

01:30:43.371 --> 01:30:45.172
He was hassling me, man.

01:30:46.174 --> 01:30:47.307
Okay?

01:30:48.910 --> 01:30:51.511
And he wasn't
going to stop.

01:30:51.513 --> 01:30:53.880
No one's going
to make him stop.

01:30:54.916 --> 01:30:57.984
And he deserved it, right?

01:31:01.322 --> 01:31:02.589
He deserved it.

01:31:04.258 --> 01:31:05.959
You know that.

01:31:05.961 --> 01:31:08.295
Hey, hey, hey.

01:31:11.232 --> 01:31:13.433
You ain't going
to tell anyone, right?

01:31:13.435 --> 01:31:14.768
Huh?

01:31:14.770 --> 01:31:16.136
You won't tell anybody.

01:31:18.506 --> 01:31:19.906
You can't tell.

01:31:29.951 --> 01:31:32.552
So beautiful, huh?

01:31:34.222 --> 01:31:35.822
Little baby.

01:33:40.548 --> 01:33:42.248
Didn't wake you, did I?

01:33:44.986 --> 01:33:47.020
Lindsay's back
in town.

01:33:48.589 --> 01:33:51.591
He killed that man.
Yeah.

01:33:51.593 --> 01:33:54.294
Knowing it doesn't help,
does it?

01:33:54.296 --> 01:33:56.062
They're on their way now
to lock him up.

01:33:56.697 --> 01:33:58.665
Goddamn fool.

01:34:12.446 --> 01:34:14.114
There's nothing.

01:34:23.424 --> 01:34:25.458
<i> It's called</i>
<i> a time capsule.</i>

01:34:27.495 --> 01:34:29.262
He made it in school
when he was...

01:34:30.064 --> 01:34:33.833
I don't know, 11?

01:34:40.441 --> 01:34:42.175
We're out of coffee.

01:34:46.714 --> 01:34:48.548
Finally got ahold of him
last night.

01:34:50.818 --> 01:34:53.887
He just got back to Kabul
from who knows where.

01:34:55.089 --> 01:34:57.223
Oh, I get so excited.

01:34:58.726 --> 01:35:01.828
I think talking to him's
going to make me feel better.

01:35:06.967 --> 01:35:08.368
I could have sworn
i remembered

01:35:08.370 --> 01:35:09.969
exactly where it was.

01:35:17.712 --> 01:35:20.814
I wanted to find what he used
to think was worth saving.

01:35:34.128 --> 01:35:37.130
I guess we both made a meal
of things last night, yeah?

01:35:41.102 --> 01:35:43.069
Isn't very good, is it?

01:36:08.262 --> 01:36:10.163
I love this song.

01:36:12.867 --> 01:36:14.134
Come here.

01:36:15.236 --> 01:36:16.302
Come.

01:36:16.304 --> 01:36:17.570
Oh, no, no, no, no.

01:36:17.572 --> 01:36:19.139
Gloria, please.

01:36:19.141 --> 01:36:20.740
Gloria, please.

01:36:24.812 --> 01:36:26.045
Gloria.

01:36:26.914 --> 01:36:29.883
Feel your feet
on the ground, hmm?

01:36:32.319 --> 01:36:33.419
Shh.

01:37:39.053 --> 01:37:40.553
Gloria.

01:38:04.845 --> 01:38:06.112
<i> Gabe.</i>

01:38:06.114 --> 01:38:07.947
<i> Osman.</i>

01:38:07.949 --> 01:38:09.515
<i> I didn't think</i>
<i> you'd be up, man.</i>

01:38:09.517 --> 01:38:11.818
Couldn't sleep,
so I went for a walk.

01:38:12.853 --> 01:38:14.687
<i> Where are you?</i>

01:38:14.689 --> 01:38:15.855
<i> Kuru village.</i>

01:38:15.857 --> 01:38:19.225
<i> Up at that spot</i>
<i> you showed me.</i>

01:38:19.227 --> 01:38:21.895
Not sure I'll ever
make it down, though.

01:38:26.533 --> 01:38:27.934
Come on in, you guys!

01:38:27.936 --> 01:38:29.235
Water's great!

01:38:29.737 --> 01:38:31.170
Never again!

01:38:33.909 --> 01:38:35.742
<i> Gabe.</i>
Yeah?

01:38:36.777 --> 01:38:38.845
I wish I was there
with you, man.

01:38:41.148 --> 01:38:42.749
Just for a second.

01:38:55.362 --> 01:38:57.063
<i> Can you hear it?</i>

01:39:17.918 --> 01:39:19.752
<i> I can hear it.</i>
