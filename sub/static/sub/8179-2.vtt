00:01.550 --> 00:03.234
<i>PREVIOUSLY
ON KING OF QUEENS...</i>

00:03.302 --> 00:04.819
HONEY, I AM
SO PROUD OF YOU

00:04.887 --> 00:06.955
FOR STICKING TO
THIS DIET.

00:07.023 --> 00:08.273
NO CARBS, NO SUGAR,

00:08.340 --> 00:10.341
NO BOOBIES.

00:10.409 --> 00:12.644
I RENTED THIS AWESOME LODGE
UP IN THE MOUNTAINS.

00:12.712 --> 00:14.412
I TOOK HER THERE 10 YEARS AGO.
WE HAD A GREAT TIME.

00:14.480 --> 00:17.665
THAT'S STRANGE. I CAN'T SEEM
TO FIND MY CAR KEYS.

00:17.733 --> 00:20.485
ARTHUR, DOUG AND CARRIE
SAID YOU COULDN'T DRIVE.

00:20.553 --> 00:22.237
WHAT IF IT'S AN EMERGENCY? NO!

00:22.304 --> 00:23.221
I DON'T KNOW.

00:23.372 --> 00:25.473
HE COULD PROBABLY DRIVE
IF IT'S AN EMERGENCY.

00:25.541 --> 00:27.258
CAN YOU BELIEVE
I GOT US THE SAME ROOM?

00:27.326 --> 00:28.176
HMM?

00:28.244 --> 00:30.629
I GOT US THE SAME ROOM
AS LAST TIME.

00:30.696 --> 00:31.929
WHAT LAST TIME?

00:34.399 --> 00:36.001
LAST TIME WE WERE HERE.

00:36.068 --> 00:37.468
WE WERE NEVER HERE.

00:37.536 --> 00:38.803
COME ON. STOP IT.

00:41.873 --> 00:43.225
IS BETH HERE WITH YOU?

00:43.292 --> 00:45.076
OH, MY GOD.

01:17.810 --> 01:20.211
LAND HO!

01:20.279 --> 01:22.496
NOW, WHEN WE GET OUT OF
THE BOAT HERE, STEP LIVELY.

01:22.564 --> 01:24.498
REMEMBER, THIS IS
TURTLE COUNTRY.

01:27.903 --> 01:29.637
IT'S ALL GOOD.
IT'S ALL GOOD.

01:29.704 --> 01:32.807
HERE WE GO. OK.

01:32.874 --> 01:34.375
MILADY.

01:37.046 --> 01:38.779
THERE WE GO.

01:38.847 --> 01:39.698
DOUG. DOUG.

01:39.765 --> 01:41.849
I GOT IT. I GOT IT.
DOUG'S GOT IT.

01:45.254 --> 01:47.488
WHOO! YOU KNOW WHAT
I LIKE ABOUT THIS PLACE?

01:47.556 --> 01:49.124
IT'S TOTALLY NEW.

01:49.191 --> 01:51.692
NEVER SEEN IT BEFORE.
NEVER BEEN HERE BEFORE.

01:51.760 --> 01:53.962
IS FRESH.

01:54.029 --> 01:56.064
SO WHAT DO
YOU WANNA DO?

01:56.132 --> 01:57.298
I DON'T KNOW.

01:57.366 --> 01:59.851
WELL, WHAT DO PEOPLE
USUALLY DO HERE?

01:59.919 --> 02:01.485
UH...

02:01.554 --> 02:03.454
TAKE IN THE SCENERY,
I GUESS.

02:03.522 --> 02:04.455
UH-HUH.

02:04.523 --> 02:07.141
COME ON. WHAT DO YOU SAY? SHALL WE?

02:09.445 --> 02:11.462
ALL RIGHT.
NOW, YOU SEE THAT?

02:11.531 --> 02:13.264
THAT'S POISON IVY.

02:13.332 --> 02:15.100
LEAVES OF 3,
LET IT BE.

02:15.167 --> 02:17.602
LEARNED THAT
IN BOY SCOUTS.

02:17.669 --> 02:19.037
HUH.

02:20.572 --> 02:23.041
WHAT ELSE YOU GOT?

02:23.109 --> 02:27.095
I READ IN THE BROCHURE THAT THIS
AREA HAS 22 INDIGENOUS FERNS.

02:27.162 --> 02:30.331
WANNA DISCOVER A NEW ONE
AND NAME IT CARRIE?

02:33.452 --> 02:34.986
THE CANOE!

02:35.054 --> 02:36.921
OH, CRAP!

02:36.989 --> 02:38.173
WATCH IT! LEAVES OF 3! LEAVES OF 3!

02:38.240 --> 02:40.342
CRAP! CRAP!

02:43.512 --> 02:45.213
COLD! COLD!

02:45.281 --> 02:47.231
SO COLD.

02:47.299 --> 02:49.850
COLD! COLD.

02:56.525 --> 02:59.110
ALL RIGHT, BOYS,
WE'RE GOIN' IN.

02:59.178 --> 03:01.179
DOWN GOES FRAZIER.

03:06.768 --> 03:08.886
IT'S TOO FAR!
I CAN'T GET IT!

03:11.624 --> 03:12.891
JUST SWIM!

03:12.959 --> 03:14.626
I JUST
SWALLOWED A FISH!

03:14.693 --> 03:16.093
I DON'T THINK
YOU DID.

03:16.161 --> 03:18.129
I DID. I THINK
IT WAS A SARDINE.

03:18.196 --> 03:18.830
YOU LOVE SARDINES.

03:18.898 --> 03:20.382
WITH MAYO!

03:20.449 --> 03:22.267
ALL RIGHT. YOU KNOW WHAT?
BRING IT IN. BRING IT IN.

03:26.421 --> 03:28.673
COME ON!

03:34.063 --> 03:37.482
WELL, THAT WAS
PRETTY PATHETIC.

03:37.549 --> 03:39.317
WELL, ON BEHALF
OF MYSELF

03:39.385 --> 03:41.319
AND THE BABY SARDINES
GROWING IN MY STOMACH,

03:41.387 --> 03:43.154
THANKS FOR THE LOVE.

03:43.221 --> 03:44.939
SO, WHAT DO
WE DO NOW?

03:45.007 --> 03:47.809
YOU THINK WE CAN
GET BACK ON FOOT?

03:47.876 --> 03:49.744
I'M SURE WE COULD
IF WE KNEW WHERE WE WERE,

03:49.812 --> 03:52.046
BUT I'VE NEVER
BEEN HERE BEFORE, REMEMBER?

03:52.114 --> 03:53.397
IS FRESH!

03:53.465 --> 03:54.232
OY.

03:54.300 --> 03:55.417
ALL RIGHT.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

03:55.484 --> 03:56.551
WE HAVE
THE CELL PHONE.

03:56.619 --> 03:58.453
WE'LL CALL INFORMATION FOR THE HOTEL,

03:58.521 --> 04:00.555
AND THEY WILL GIVE US DIRECTIONS BACK.

04:00.623 --> 04:03.258
IT'S, UH,
MOUNTAIN VIEW LODGE, RIGHT?

04:03.325 --> 04:04.892
I THOUGHT IT WAS
MOUNTAIN RIDGE.

04:04.960 --> 04:06.494
WHAT?
NO, YOU'RE WRONG.

04:06.561 --> 04:08.062
NO, YOU'RE WRONG.
UH, EXCUSE ME.

04:08.130 --> 04:09.347
I'M THE ONE WHO MADE
THE RESERVATION.

04:09.415 --> 04:11.048
I THINK I KNOW
THE NAME OF THE HOTEL.

04:11.116 --> 04:12.350
UH, EXCUSE ME.

04:12.417 --> 04:14.385
YOU DON'T EVEN REMEMBER
WHICH GIRL YOU BROUGHT HERE.

04:15.888 --> 04:17.154
FINE. YOU KNOW WHAT?

04:17.223 --> 04:19.324
JUST CALL YOUR DAD.
I LEFT THE NUMBER WITH HIM.

04:24.530 --> 04:25.964
HELLO?

04:26.032 --> 04:26.881
HEY, DAD.

04:26.949 --> 04:27.915
WHO IS THIS?

04:27.983 --> 04:30.068
CARRIE.

04:30.136 --> 04:32.370
LISTEN, IT'S NOT
A BIG DEAL.

04:32.437 --> 04:33.805
DOUG AND I ARE
A LITTLE LOST.

04:33.873 --> 04:35.139
IS THIS
AN EMERGENCY?

04:35.207 --> 04:37.925
WELL, YEAH. KINDA.

04:37.993 --> 04:40.094
HOLD ON, BABY!
DADDY'S COMING!

04:44.216 --> 04:46.517
OK, THAT'S
NOT GONNA WORK.

04:46.585 --> 04:48.386
YOU KNOW WHAT? LET ME
JUST CALL INFORMATION.

04:48.453 --> 04:51.022
LET THEM
FIGURE IT OUT.

04:53.926 --> 04:56.861
YEAH, HEY. I NEED THE
NUMBER TO MOUNTAIN LAKE LODGE

04:56.929 --> 04:59.780
NEAR LAKE CHAPAWAWA.

04:59.848 --> 05:02.083
NOTHING?

05:02.151 --> 05:04.752
HOW ABOUT
MOUNTAIN RIDGE LODGE?

05:04.820 --> 05:08.022
LAKEVIEW? LAKE RIDGE?

05:08.090 --> 05:10.959
LAND O' LAKES.
EMERSON, LAKE, AND PALMER.

05:11.026 --> 05:12.527
HELP ME OUT HERE, OK?

05:19.418 --> 05:21.052
DO YOU HAPPEN
TO HAVE A LISTING

05:21.119 --> 05:23.888
FOR AN ELIZABETH McGURTRIE
IN STATEN ISLAND?

05:25.691 --> 05:29.627
IT MIGHT BE BETH McGURTRIE. CHECK THAT.

05:29.695 --> 05:31.563
OH, MY GOD.

05:31.630 --> 05:33.765
WHAT ARE
YOU DOING?

05:33.832 --> 05:35.249
NO, IT'S A DIFFERENT BETH.

05:35.317 --> 05:36.550
THIS ONE'S
A PARK RANGER.

05:36.618 --> 05:38.386
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE CALLING HER!

05:38.454 --> 05:40.722
MAYBE SHE CAN REMEMBER
THE NAME OF THE PLACE.

05:40.789 --> 05:43.241
THIS IS-IT'S UNBELI- I
MEAN, FIRST YOU BRING ME HERE

05:43.308 --> 05:44.575
THINKING
THAT I'M HER-

05:44.643 --> 05:45.676
OH, MY GOD!

05:45.744 --> 05:47.445
HOW MANY TIMES DO I GOTTA
APOLOGIZE FOR THIS?!

05:47.513 --> 05:49.780
I MADE A MISTAKE, OK?!
CAN WE MOVE ON?!

05:49.848 --> 05:51.015
NO, WE CAN'T
MOVE ON, DOUG.

05:51.083 --> 05:52.250
YOU KNOW, I DON'T
THINK THIS IS A MISTAKE.

05:52.317 --> 05:53.584
I MEAN, EVER SINCE YOU'VE
LOST ALL THAT WEIGHT,

05:53.652 --> 05:55.653
YOU'VE BECOME
AN INSENSITIVE JERK.

05:55.721 --> 05:57.004
WHAT?!
THAT'S RIGHT!

05:57.072 --> 05:58.873
FAT DOUG WOULD
NEVER DO THIS TO ME.

05:58.941 --> 06:00.724
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

06:00.792 --> 06:04.762
FAT DOUG WAS SENSITIVE,
LOVING, CARING, AND KIND.

06:04.830 --> 06:05.797
YOU NEVER
TOLD HIM THAT.

06:05.864 --> 06:07.164
I DIDN'T NEED TO.

06:07.232 --> 06:09.350
FAT DOUG DIDN'T NEED HIS
EGO BOOSTED ALL THE TIME.

06:09.418 --> 06:11.803
YOU KNOW WHAT? "FAT
DOUG" IS A LITTLE HARSH.

06:11.870 --> 06:13.104
LET'S GO WITH F.D.

06:13.172 --> 06:14.272
YOU KNOW WHY YOU CAN'T
TELL THE DIFFERENCE

06:14.339 --> 06:16.241
BETWEEN ME
AND BETH McGURTRIE?

06:16.308 --> 06:18.676
BECAUSE YOUR BRAIN HAS
BEEN TURNED UPSIDE DOWN

06:18.744 --> 06:20.511
FROM ALL THESE PEOPLE
DROOLING ALL OVER YOU.

06:20.579 --> 06:22.013
SICKENING.

06:24.966 --> 06:27.501
OH, MY GOD!
YOU'RE JEALOUS!

06:27.569 --> 06:29.253
JEALOUS?!

06:29.321 --> 06:31.639
THAT'S RIGHT. I THINK
YOU LIKED IT BETTER

06:31.707 --> 06:33.240
WHEN IT WAS
HOTTIE AND FATTY.

06:33.308 --> 06:34.542
NOW IT'S HOTTIE
AND HOTTIE,

06:34.610 --> 06:36.677
YOU GOTTA SHARE THE SPOTLIGHT,
AND YOU DON'T LIKE IT.

06:38.096 --> 06:42.133
ARE YOU ACTUALLY ACCUSING ME
OF BEING THAT SMALL AND PETTY?

06:43.802 --> 06:44.969
UH-HUH!

06:45.037 --> 06:46.737
FOR YEARS, YOU'RE
NAGGING ME TO LOSE WEIGHT.

06:46.805 --> 06:49.207
"OH, YOU LOOK TERRIBLE. YOU'RE
GONNA DIE." BLAH BLAH BLAH!

06:49.274 --> 06:51.742
TURNS OUT, YOU CAN'T
HANDLE THE COMPETITION!

06:51.810 --> 06:52.911
OH!

06:52.978 --> 06:54.128
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

06:54.196 --> 06:54.895
WHAT AM I DOING?

06:54.963 --> 06:56.347
I'M STEALING
YOUR THUNDER.

06:56.414 --> 06:58.750
YEAH!
THAT'S THUNDER!

06:58.817 --> 06:59.750
OH, GET AWAY FROM ME!

06:59.818 --> 07:00.485
WHERE YOU GOING?

07:00.553 --> 07:01.569
YOU LOOKING
FOR YOUR THUNDER?

07:01.637 --> 07:02.570
'CAUSE YOU AIN'T
GONNA FIND IT.

07:02.638 --> 07:04.639
YOU KNOW WHY?
I GOT IT ALL.

07:04.706 --> 07:06.974
NO, I'M LOOKING
FOR THE HOTEL, BRAIN.

07:07.041 --> 07:08.643
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT? IF YOU
WOULD HAVE LET ME CALL BETH,

07:08.710 --> 07:10.077
MAYBE WE'D
FIND OUR WAY BACK.

07:10.145 --> 07:12.379
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT? MAYBE
YOU SHOULD CALL BETH

07:12.448 --> 07:14.749
AND SEE IF SHE'S
STILL AVAILABLE.

07:14.817 --> 07:16.600
OH, YEAH? YOU'D LOVE IT IF I
GOT BACK TOGETHER WITH BETH.

07:16.668 --> 07:18.736
THEN YOU'D BE FREE TO
GO AFTER ANOTHER BIG BOY.

07:18.804 --> 07:21.372
HOW'S THIS SOUND?
MRS. DOM DeLUISE.

07:21.440 --> 07:23.641
OR BETTER YET, HOOK UP
WITH THE KOOL-AID MAN.

07:23.709 --> 07:25.210
OH, YEAH!

07:27.429 --> 07:29.997
YOU KNOW, DO ME A FAVOR AND
DON'T TALK TO ME. I'M SICK OF YOU.

07:30.065 --> 07:31.799
RIGHT BACK AT YOU.

07:33.568 --> 07:36.304
IS IT RAINING?

07:36.371 --> 07:38.739
A LITTLE.

07:38.807 --> 07:41.309
WE ARE SO SCREWED.

07:51.120 --> 07:53.320
ALL RIGHT, NOW WE'RE
MAKING SOME PROGRESS.

07:53.388 --> 07:54.489
THERE'S THE SUN.

07:54.556 --> 07:56.090
THE SUN ALWAYS SETS
IN THE WEST, RIGHT?

07:56.158 --> 07:58.025
SO WE MUST BE
HEADING WEST.

07:58.093 --> 08:02.212
<i>AND DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
IF THE HOTEL IS WEST?</i>

08:02.280 --> 08:03.914
BOY, YOU REALLY
HATE THE FACT

08:03.982 --> 08:06.217
THAT I'M HOT NOW,
DON'T YOU?

08:06.285 --> 08:08.235
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE WENT TOO FAR.

08:08.303 --> 08:09.904
WE SHOULD GO BACK
THE OTHER WAY.

08:09.972 --> 08:11.238
NO, NO.
YOU'RE TOTALLY WRONG.

08:11.306 --> 08:12.239
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

08:12.307 --> 08:13.607
OH, I DON'T?!

08:13.675 --> 08:14.308
YOU HAVE US
HEADING WEST,

08:14.376 --> 08:15.826
AND YOU HAVE
NO IDEA WHY.

08:15.894 --> 08:17.645
UH, THE PIONEERS
DIDN'T KNOW WHY,

08:17.713 --> 08:18.846
AND THAT'S HOW
WE GOT TEXAS.

08:18.913 --> 08:21.215
BUT I GUESS YOU'D BE FINE WITHOUT TEXAS.

08:21.282 --> 08:23.818
I JUST WISH I KNEW
WHERE WE WERE.

08:23.885 --> 08:25.152
I MEAN, ARE WE
GETTING CLOSER?

08:25.220 --> 08:26.420
ARE WE GETTING
FARTHER?

08:26.488 --> 08:28.255
WHAT?

08:29.324 --> 08:30.424
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

08:30.492 --> 08:33.227
I'M GONNA SEE IF I CAN
FIND THE HOTEL FROM HERE.

08:33.294 --> 08:34.595
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
SEE ANYTHING.

08:34.663 --> 08:35.446
I MIGHT SEE SOMETHING!

08:35.513 --> 08:36.563
I DON'T THINK
YOU WILL.

08:36.631 --> 08:40.368
I CAN'T TALK AND CLIMB
AT THE SAME TIME.

08:48.844 --> 08:50.478
OH, GOD!

08:50.546 --> 08:51.712
WHAT'S WRONG?

08:51.780 --> 08:53.814
IT'S AN OWL.

08:53.882 --> 08:55.633
I THINK I'M
GONNA THROW UP.

08:55.700 --> 08:57.885
WHO THROWS UP
FROM AN OWL?

08:57.952 --> 09:00.971
LOOK, I WAS EXPECTING PINE CONES,
AND I GOT A SQUARE-SHAPED BIRD.

09:01.039 --> 09:02.507
IT'S VERY DISTURBING.

09:02.574 --> 09:03.908
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT? JUST NUDGE IT,

09:03.976 --> 09:05.243
AND IT'LL
FLY AWAY.

09:05.311 --> 09:06.327
NO, I'M NOT
GONNA TOUCH IT.

09:06.394 --> 09:07.595
WHAT IF IT BITES ME?

09:07.662 --> 09:09.113
OWLS DON'T BITE.

09:09.181 --> 09:10.114
THEY WEAR GLASSES.

09:10.182 --> 09:11.982
THEY'RE THE NERDS
OF THE FOREST.

09:12.050 --> 09:13.784
ALL RIGHT.

09:13.852 --> 09:15.986
NO, OWLS CAN'T FLY.

09:16.054 --> 09:17.872
IF IT DOESN'T FLY,
HOW'D IT GET IN THE TREE?

09:17.940 --> 09:20.307
UH, I'M IN THE TREE.
CAN I FLY?

09:20.375 --> 09:22.242
COULD YOU JUST
PUSH IT AWAY, PLEASE?

09:22.310 --> 09:24.929
OH. HOPE IT LANDS
RIGHT ON YOU.

09:24.997 --> 09:26.998
I WOULD LOVE THAT.

09:28.767 --> 09:30.417
WHOA!

09:31.753 --> 09:33.554
OOH... OH, MY GOD! ARE YOU OK?

09:33.622 --> 09:34.655
I THINK SO.

09:34.723 --> 09:35.756
I SCRATCHED
MY FACE, THOUGH.

09:35.824 --> 09:36.991
OH...

09:37.059 --> 09:38.025
ALL RIGHT,
A LITTLE BACTINE,

09:38.093 --> 09:39.760
AND YOU WILL BE
GOOD AS NEW.

09:39.827 --> 09:41.045
OH, SUDDENLY
I'M DEFORMED,

09:41.112 --> 09:43.247
AND YOU'RE NICE
TO ME.

09:43.315 --> 09:45.816
<i>YOU GOT A REAL BEAUTY AND THE
BEAST THING GOING, DON'T YOU?</i>

09:45.884 --> 09:47.401
ARE YOU CRAZY?!

09:47.469 --> 09:49.486
CRAZY UGLY, JUST THE WAY YOU LIKE 'EM!

09:49.554 --> 09:50.971
WELL, NOW I'M TAKING YOU DOWN WITH ME.

09:51.039 --> 09:54.642
OH, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

09:54.709 --> 09:55.375
I'M FINDING
SOME LEAVES OF 3,

09:55.527 --> 09:57.761
AND THEN I'M GONNA
MESS YOU UP.

09:57.829 --> 09:59.029
WHAT?

09:59.097 --> 10:00.514
YEAH.

10:00.582 --> 10:02.817
KISS THAT SWEET,
UNBLEMISHED SKIN GOOD-BYE.

10:02.884 --> 10:05.185
DOUG, ARE YOU SERIOUSLY
GONNA ATTACK ME

10:05.254 --> 10:07.187
WITH POISON IVY?

10:07.256 --> 10:09.557
I MEAN, IS THAT THE WAY
IT'S GONNA END FOR US?

10:11.493 --> 10:12.927
NO.

10:15.230 --> 10:17.297
MY HAND ITCHES NOW.

10:26.908 --> 10:28.576
I DON'T BELIEVE ANYONE
EVER MADE FIRE THIS WAY.

10:28.644 --> 10:29.910
I JUST DON'T.

10:29.978 --> 10:31.912
AND I DON'T BELIEVE
THE ONLY THING

10:31.980 --> 10:33.514
YOU EVER LEARNED
FROM THE BOY SCOUTS

10:33.582 --> 10:35.949
WAS HOW MANY LEAVES
POISON IVY HAS.

10:36.017 --> 10:38.686
<i>AND NOW YOU HAVE
POISON IVY!</i>

10:38.754 --> 10:40.755
I'M GOING TO SLEEP.

10:58.873 --> 11:02.943
OH, WOW.
THAT'S THE NORTH STAR.

11:03.011 --> 11:05.245
THAT WAY MUST BE NORTH.

11:05.314 --> 11:09.417
AND DO YOU KNOW
IF THE HOTEL IS NORTH?

11:12.187 --> 11:14.388
I HATE THE SKY.

11:18.460 --> 11:20.994
ACTUALLY, IT'S KIND OF
BEAUTIFUL TONIGHT.

11:31.189 --> 11:33.558
THAT BETTER BE A RAT.

11:38.229 --> 11:41.666
JUST THINKING, YOU KNOW,
IT'S YOU AND I...

11:41.733 --> 11:46.904
ALONE IN THE WOODS...
ABOUT TO DIE...

11:46.972 --> 11:48.706
IT'S KIND OF ROMANTIC.
YOU WANT TO, UH-

11:48.774 --> 11:51.542
WHAT PLANET
ARE YOU ON?

11:53.479 --> 11:55.346
I JUST DON'T THINK WE
SHOULD GO TO BED ANGRY.

11:55.413 --> 11:56.848
WELL, WE'RE NOT GOING
TO BED.

11:56.915 --> 11:59.116
WE'RE GOING TO TWIGS.

11:59.184 --> 12:00.117
WELL, THEN,
I DON'T THINK

12:00.185 --> 12:02.453
WE SHOULD GO TO TWIGS
ANGRY, EITHER.

12:07.759 --> 12:10.227
ALL RIGHT, LAST CHANCE,
'CAUSE...

12:10.295 --> 12:12.096
I'M SHUTTIN' HER DOWN.

12:21.389 --> 12:22.440
HEY.

12:22.507 --> 12:25.008
HELLO.

12:25.076 --> 12:26.043
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOU?

12:26.110 --> 12:28.813
NOTHING.

12:28.880 --> 12:30.514
YOU ALWAYS
SAY NOTHING

12:30.582 --> 12:32.717
WHEN IT'S
SOMETHING.

12:32.784 --> 12:34.885
WHAT IS IT?

12:34.953 --> 12:37.421
YOU KNOW VERY WELL
WHAT IT IS.

12:39.190 --> 12:40.658
NO, I DON'T.

12:40.726 --> 12:43.077
YOU TOTALLY MADE ME THE
BAD COP TODAY WITH ARTHUR.

12:43.145 --> 12:44.945
YOU HAD NO RIGHT
TO DO THAT.

12:45.797 --> 12:48.082
OH, EXCUSE ME.

12:49.851 --> 12:52.420
UH... SORRY.

12:52.487 --> 12:55.489
UM, DANNY SAID I CAN
BORROW THE PLAYSTATION,

12:55.557 --> 12:58.091
AND DOUG KEEPS IT
UP HERE, SO...

12:58.159 --> 13:00.244
FINE. I JUST...

13:00.312 --> 13:02.213
WASN'T EXPECTING YOU.

13:04.465 --> 13:06.500
SURE.

13:06.568 --> 13:08.135
WE WERE KIND OF, UH...

13:08.202 --> 13:09.970
IN THE MIDDLE
OF SOMETHING HERE, DEAC.

13:13.158 --> 13:15.726
ARE YOU GUYS BOTH
SLEEPING IN HERE?

13:15.794 --> 13:17.911
YEAH.

13:17.979 --> 13:19.580
WELL, YOU KNOW THERE'S A
FUTON IN THE OTHER ROOM,

13:19.648 --> 13:21.382
AND THERE'S A COU-

13:21.450 --> 13:23.750
NEVER MIND.

13:23.818 --> 13:25.469
WOULD YOU JUST LEAVE,
PLEASE?!

13:25.537 --> 13:26.437
BELIEVE ME, I'M NOT
LOOKING FOR ANY REASON

13:26.505 --> 13:27.772
TO HANG AROUND.

13:29.708 --> 13:32.226
LOOK...

13:35.430 --> 13:37.564
I'M SORRY ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED TODAY.

13:37.633 --> 13:39.500
ALL RIGHT, I JUST THOUGHT
THAT THE EASIEST WAY

13:39.567 --> 13:42.103
TO DEAL WITH ARTHUR
WAS TO GIVE IN TO HIM.

13:42.170 --> 13:43.871
OF COURSE THAT'S
THE EASIEST WAY.

13:43.939 --> 13:45.439
BUT IF WE ALWAYS TAKE
THE EASY WAY OUT,

13:45.507 --> 13:47.608
HOW'S HE EVER
GONNA LEARN?

13:49.210 --> 13:51.612
WELL, HE IS
ALMOST 80.

13:53.214 --> 13:55.049
LOOK, WHY DON'T WE GET A
GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP, ALL RIGHT?

13:55.117 --> 13:56.984
AND IN THE MORNING, WE'LL
SIT DOWN WITH ARTHUR,

13:57.052 --> 14:00.454
AND WE'LL TELL HIM THERE ARE
CERTAIN RULES IN THIS HOUSE

14:00.522 --> 14:02.757
AND HE HAS TO LIVE
BY THEM.

14:31.270 --> 14:34.272
OK, STILL IN THE WOODS.

14:34.339 --> 14:36.908
OW. OW. OW.
OW. OW!

14:36.975 --> 14:38.475
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THERE ARE PEOPLE

14:38.543 --> 14:40.644
WHO ACTUALLY
GO CAMPING BY CHOICE.

14:42.363 --> 14:44.631
OH, MY GOD, WHAT IF WE NEVER
FIND OUR WAY OUT OF HERE?

14:44.700 --> 14:46.834
THAT WOULD BE BAD, DOUG.

14:48.103 --> 14:50.304
YOU KNOW WHAT? MAYBE WE
SHOULD JUST LIVE HERE,

14:50.371 --> 14:52.639
START A NEW SOCIETY,

14:52.708 --> 14:54.541
LEARN TO TALK
WITH THE CHIPMUNKS.

14:54.609 --> 14:57.712
YOU CAN'T EVEN TOUCH
AN OWL WITHOUT GAGGING.

14:57.779 --> 14:59.479
NOW YOU'RE TALKING
TO CHIPMUNKS?

14:59.547 --> 15:01.682
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT? I
WON'T START MY OWN SOCIETY.

15:01.750 --> 15:02.717
OK, YOU HAPPY NOW?

15:02.784 --> 15:04.251
YES. I'M THRILLED.

15:04.319 --> 15:06.921
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S GET MOVING.

15:06.988 --> 15:11.157
I THINK WE SHOULD GO,
UH... THIS WAY.

15:11.225 --> 15:14.528
NO, THAT'S THE WAY
WE CAME FROM.

15:14.596 --> 15:19.617
NO, THAT... IS... THE WAY...
WE CAME... FROM!

15:19.684 --> 15:23.454
TALKING... LIKE... THIS...
DOESN'T... SCARE... ME!

15:23.522 --> 15:25.706
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I HAVE AN IDEA.

15:25.774 --> 15:28.742
HOW 'BOUT YOU GO YOUR WAY,
I'LL GO MINE?

15:28.810 --> 15:30.794
<i>SMARTEST IDEA
YOU'VE HAD EVER.</i>

15:30.862 --> 15:32.346
TERRIFIC!

15:32.413 --> 15:34.281
OH, AND DON'T GO
STARTIN' YOUR OWN SOCIETY.

15:34.349 --> 15:35.549
THAT'S MY THING!

15:56.404 --> 15:59.256
DOUG?

15:59.324 --> 16:01.091
DOUG!

16:13.871 --> 16:16.139
GOD BLESS HER,
SHE GOT AWAY!

16:16.208 --> 16:18.008
ATTAGIRL!

16:42.701 --> 16:46.103
I'LL HAVE THE
EGG-WHITE OMELET...

16:46.170 --> 16:48.105
AND...

17:36.955 --> 17:39.824
I WILL SURVIVE!

17:39.891 --> 17:43.360
I CHOOSE LIFE!

18:05.983 --> 18:07.601
COULD I GET THE CHECK?

18:07.668 --> 18:10.371
OH, AND A MAP
TO RESCUE MY HUSBAND.

18:10.438 --> 18:11.372
THANKS.

18:22.300 --> 18:24.468
DOUG?

18:24.536 --> 18:26.136
CARRIE?

18:26.204 --> 18:28.205
IS THAT YOU CRYING?

18:28.272 --> 18:30.340
NO.

18:30.408 --> 18:33.043
FOLLOW MY VOICE.
I FOUND A WAY OUT.

18:36.815 --> 18:37.781
OOF!

18:40.268 --> 18:41.368
HEY!

18:53.648 --> 18:56.049
WHAT DO I DO?

18:56.117 --> 18:57.450
JUST CROSS OVER THE BRIDGE.

18:57.518 --> 18:58.936
ARE YOU CRAZY?!

18:59.004 --> 19:00.738
COME ON.
YOU CAN DO IT.

19:12.617 --> 19:13.884
CROSS OVER
THE BRIDGE.

19:13.952 --> 19:16.053
EASY FOR YOU.

19:16.120 --> 19:17.855
YOU'RE ON
THE RIGHT SIDE.

19:21.209 --> 19:23.594
SHABA-LAMA...

19:25.196 --> 19:26.764
YOU'RE DOING GREAT.

19:35.890 --> 19:36.957
GAA-VUCH!

19:38.977 --> 19:40.544
OH, GOD!

19:43.882 --> 19:45.265
YOU'RE FINE!
YOU'RE FINE!

19:45.333 --> 19:48.468
I'M NOT FINE!

19:48.536 --> 19:50.603
GET ME
A HELICOPTER NOW!

19:50.671 --> 19:52.071
DOUG, YOU DON'T NEED
A HELICOPTER.

19:52.139 --> 19:54.842
I REALLY THINK A
HELICOPTER'S THE WAY TO GO.

19:54.909 --> 19:58.178
DOUG, LISTEN TO ME.
YOU CAN DO THIS.

19:58.246 --> 20:00.180
I CAN'T. THIS BRIDGE'LL NEVER HOLD.

20:00.248 --> 20:01.465
YES, IT WILL.

20:01.532 --> 20:03.233
LOOK, YOU'RE NOT FAT
ANYMORE.

20:03.301 --> 20:04.268
YOU'RE LIGHT AS AIR.

20:04.335 --> 20:07.504
I KNOW YOU'RE LYING NOW.

20:07.572 --> 20:09.473
I'M GOING BACK.
I'LL LIVE HERE.

20:09.540 --> 20:12.175
YOU START A NEW LIFE
WITH DOM DeLUISE.

20:12.243 --> 20:13.610
NO, DOUG, STOP.

20:13.678 --> 20:16.313
I DON'T WANT DOM DeLUISE.
I WANT YOU, OK?

20:18.750 --> 20:19.683
REALLY?

20:19.751 --> 20:20.717
YES.

20:20.785 --> 20:22.286
NOW, LOOK, I KNOW
I WENT A LITTLE CRAZY

20:22.353 --> 20:23.353
WITH THIS BETH THING

20:23.421 --> 20:24.354
AND YOU LOSING
ALL THE WEIGHT

20:24.422 --> 20:26.022
AND GETTING
ALL THAT ATTENTION...

20:26.090 --> 20:28.091
'CAUSE YOU-
YOU STOLE MY THUNDER.

20:28.159 --> 20:29.927
YOU KNOW? AND, UH...

20:29.995 --> 20:31.929
DIDN'T LOVE IT.

20:31.996 --> 20:33.964
CAN'T BLAME A GIRL
FOR WANTING HER THUNDER.

20:34.031 --> 20:35.799
BUT THE THING IS, DOUG,

20:35.867 --> 20:38.001
YOU DESERVE
THE ATTENTION, OK?

20:38.069 --> 20:41.171
AND-AND I LOVE YOU,
AND I'M SO SORRY,

20:41.238 --> 20:43.239
AND I KNOW THAT YOU ARE
SKINNY ENOUGH

20:43.307 --> 20:45.041
TO MAKE IT
ACROSS THIS BRIDGE.

20:45.109 --> 20:48.429
THEN WHY DID THAT
LITTLE THINGY BREAK?

20:48.496 --> 20:49.863
'CAUSE YOU'RE
STILL KINDA BIG.

20:49.931 --> 20:51.431
NOW RUN.
COME ON, HONEY.

20:51.499 --> 20:52.950
COME ON, BABY!

20:57.922 --> 21:00.423
OH, I LOVE YOU
SO MUCH.

21:01.659 --> 21:04.160
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

21:04.228 --> 21:07.631
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?
IT'S ONLY BEEN 45 MINUTES.

21:07.699 --> 21:09.533
I WENT
A LITTLE OVERBOARD.

21:12.804 --> 21:14.204
YOU KNOW, LET'S GO
TO HERSHEY PARK.

21:14.271 --> 21:15.772
YEAH.

21:26.484 --> 21:28.419
HEY. HEY. HI.

21:31.022 --> 21:32.356
WHERE'S MY DAD?

21:32.424 --> 21:33.823
