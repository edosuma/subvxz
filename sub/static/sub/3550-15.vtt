WEBVTT

00:00.671 --> 00:02.173
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.173 --> 00:05.176
A FRIEND WAS WELCOMED BACK.

00:05.176 --> 00:08.379
I TOLD THEM HOW MUCH BETTER
YOU WERE DOING.

00:08.379 --> 00:10.381
A MARRIAGE WAS ON THE MEND.

00:10.381 --> 00:13.114
I WOULD LIKE TO RECAPTURE
WHAT WE ONCE HAD.

00:13.114 --> 00:15.286
GABY AND CARLOS

00:15.286 --> 00:18.289
DISCOVERED A SECRET.
 YOU ARE GETTIN' SLOPPY!

00:18.289 --> 00:20.721
AND IF PEOPLE START
POKIN' AROUND, WE'RE DONE.

00:20.721 --> 00:23.654
AND SUSAN MADE A REQUEST.

00:23.654 --> 00:27.298
YOU'RE ASKING IF I'M OKAY WITH
LETTING A STRIPPER LIVE WITH US?

00:33.534 --> 00:36.036
(Mary Alice) THE FIRST THING
YOU NEED TO KNOW

00:36.036 --> 00:38.069
ABOUT ROBIN GALLAGHER

00:38.069 --> 00:42.443
WAS THAT EVERYONE LIKED
TO LOOK AT HER.

00:42.443 --> 00:45.776
THEY WOULD STARE AT HER LEGS...

00:45.776 --> 00:49.450
AND HER BREASTS...

00:49.450 --> 00:52.283
AND HER HAIR.

00:52.283 --> 00:54.555
AND ONCE THEY WERE DONE,

00:54.555 --> 00:57.158
PEOPLE WOULD BEGIN TO ASK...

00:57.158 --> 01:00.261
WHO IS THIS?
 THIS IS MY FRIEND ROBIN.

01:00.261 --> 01:02.062
HELLO THERE.
 MIKE HAD TO WORK TODAY,

01:02.062 --> 01:05.166
SO I THOUGHT I'D BRING HER
AS MY PLUS ONE. (chuckles)
 HELLO THERE.

01:05.166 --> 01:07.098
YOU ALREADY SAID THAT.

01:07.098 --> 01:09.600
I WANTED HER
TO KNOW I MEANT IT.

01:09.600 --> 01:11.842
IT'S REALLY GOOD TO HAVE YOU
BACK ON THE LANE, KATHERINE.

01:11.842 --> 01:13.844
IT'S GREAT TO BE BACK.
I DIDN'T KNOW

01:13.844 --> 01:16.607
WHAT TO EXPECT AT FIRST.
I HAVE WONDERED HOW EVERYONE

01:16.607 --> 01:19.850
WOULD FEEL ABOUT ME,
IF THEY WERE REALLY READY

01:19.850 --> 01:22.713
TO WELCOME ME BACK.
I GUESS THERE'S ALWAYS

01:22.713 --> 01:27.618
THAT FEAR THAT PEOPLE
ARE GOING TO REJECT YOU.

01:27.618 --> 01:30.191
DO I SMELL APPETIZERS?
 I KNOW I DO.

01:33.624 --> 01:37.398
(wheelchair rattling)

01:37.398 --> 01:39.430
HELLO, SUSAN!

01:39.430 --> 01:41.372
WHO'S YOUR NEW FRIEND?

01:41.372 --> 01:45.306
ROBIN, THIS IS CARLOS,
TOM, ROY AND ORSON.

01:45.306 --> 01:49.240
HOPE YOU GOT ALL THAT, 'CAUSE
THERE'S GONNA BE A QUIZ LATER.
 (chuckles)

01:49.240 --> 01:51.212
OH, GOD.

01:51.212 --> 01:54.185
SO, ROBIN,
WELCOME TO MY HUMBLE ABODE.

01:54.185 --> 01:55.486
(laughs)
 THANK YOU.

01:55.486 --> 01:57.448
IT'S SO SUBURBAN.

01:57.448 --> 02:00.691
I'VE NEVER BEEN IN A PLACE
WHERE THE CEILINGS WERE SO TALL.

02:00.691 --> 02:03.654
FASCINATING. JUST FASCINATING.

02:05.226 --> 02:07.198
YOU LIVE IN THE CITY?

02:07.198 --> 02:09.630
I DID, BUT I'LL BE LIVING
WITH SUSAN FOR A WHILE.

02:09.630 --> 02:11.632
I JUST MOVED IN TODAY.

02:14.435 --> 02:16.437
SUSAN,
LET'S GET YOU A DRINK.

02:16.437 --> 02:20.211
OH, NO, THAT'S OKAY.
I'LL WAIT TILL--OH!

02:20.211 --> 02:22.213
SO...

02:22.213 --> 02:24.675
SO HOW DID YOU MEET SUSAN?

02:24.675 --> 02:27.178
SO... YOU WANT TO TELL US
ABOUT YOUR NEW FRIEND

02:27.178 --> 02:29.620
OR, UH,
SHOULD I SAY "ROOMMATE"?

02:29.620 --> 02:32.623
SHE WAS DOWN ON HER LUCK
AND SHE NEEDED A PLACE TO STAY.

02:32.623 --> 02:34.325
PLUS, I FEEL RESPONSIBLE,

02:34.325 --> 02:38.659
BECAUSE I TOLD HER
TO GIVE UP HER JOB.
 WHAT WAS WRONG WITH HER JOB?

02:38.659 --> 02:43.194
WELL... WE PROBABLY DON'T NEED
TO LET THE GUYS IN ON THIS,

02:43.194 --> 02:46.166
BUT... ROBIN WAS--
 (Carlos laughs) THAT'S WILD!

02:46.166 --> 02:48.669
SO YOU USED TO BE
A STRIPPER?

02:50.501 --> 02:53.304
YES...

02:53.304 --> 02:57.278
EVERYONE LIKED TO LOOK
AT ROBIN GALLAGHER...

02:59.210 --> 03:14.225
BUT NOT EVERYONE LIKED
WHAT THEY SAW.

03:14.225 --> 03:16.767
LATER,

03:16.767 --> 03:20.431
WHILE THE MEN OF WISTERIA LANE
WERE TRYING THE SHRIMP,

03:20.431 --> 03:25.236
THEIR WIVES WERE TRYING
TO CONTROL THEMSELVES.

03:25.236 --> 03:27.378
YOU MOVED A STRIPPER
INTO THE NEIGHBORHOOD?

03:27.378 --> 03:30.911
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?
 YOU GUYS AREN'T EVEN TAKING
THE TIME TO GET TO KNOW HER.

03:30.911 --> 03:32.983
OUR HUSBANDS ARE IN THERE
POOLING TOGETHER

03:32.983 --> 03:36.417
THEIR DOLLAR BILLS.
WHAT MORE DO WE NEED TO KNOW?
 I JUST MET ROBIN.
SHE SEEMS GREAT.

03:36.417 --> 03:38.649
DID SHE MENTION
THAT SHE'S A STRIPPER?

03:38.649 --> 03:40.451
DID SHE HAVE TO?

03:40.451 --> 03:44.224
LOOK, I AM JUST TRYING TO
HELP HER GET BACK ON HER FEET.

03:44.224 --> 03:47.298
I BET THAT'D BE
A NICE CHANGE FOR HER.
 SHE IS LIVING IN MY HOUSE.

03:47.298 --> 03:49.300
IF ANYBODY SHOULD BE WORRIED,
IT'D BE ME,

03:49.300 --> 03:51.732
AND I AM NOT THREATENED BY HER
 AT ALL.

03:51.732 --> 03:52.903
REALLY?

03:52.903 --> 03:55.566
YES. SHE'S A NICE GIRL.

03:55.566 --> 03:58.509
YEAH, NICE, BLONDE, AND YOU CAN
BOUNCE A QUARTER OFF HER ASS.

03:58.509 --> 04:01.642
I'M TELLING YOU,
SHE'S TROUBLE.
 HERE'S A GOOD THING--

04:01.642 --> 04:04.345
SHE CAN'T BRING ANY MORE CRAZY
TO THIS STREET THAN I DID.

04:04.345 --> 04:06.647
LET'S GIVE HER A CHANCE.
 I AGREE.

04:06.647 --> 04:09.950
ROBIN'S PROBABLY HAD A TOUGH
LIFE, AND SHE NEEDS OUR HELP.
 WELL, I'M ALL
FOR BEING OPEN-MINDED,

04:09.950 --> 04:11.952
BUT I HAVE TEENAGE BOYS
AT HOME.

04:11.952 --> 04:15.255
THE LAST THING I NEED NEXT DOOR
IS A STRIPPER.

04:17.958 --> 04:20.291
(knock on door)

04:20.291 --> 04:23.394
HEY, MRS. SCAVO. WE'RE
PICKING UP PARKER FOR SCHOOL.

04:25.936 --> 04:29.700
PLEASE COME IN.
I'LL GET HIM FOR YOU.

04:29.700 --> 04:31.342
(door closes)

04:31.342 --> 04:34.675
SO YOU EVER GONNA GET BACK
TO FOLDING THE LAUNDRY?

04:34.675 --> 04:36.677
WELL,
I THOUGHT I'D TREAT MYSELF

04:36.677 --> 04:39.009
AND WASH THE BREAKFAST DISHES
FIRST.

04:39.009 --> 04:42.553
WELL, YOU STARTED THIS. DON'T
YOU THINK YOU SHOULD FINISH?

04:42.553 --> 04:49.520
WELL, SINCE YOU'RE
SO PASSIONATE ABOUT IT...

04:49.520 --> 04:50.991
KNOCK YOURSELF OUT.

04:55.025 --> 04:56.927
OKAY, YOU JUST WENT

04:56.927 --> 05:00.931
FROM JERK TO ADORABLE
REAL QUICK.

05:00.931 --> 05:02.002
HAPPY ANNIVERSARY.

05:02.002 --> 05:03.934
OH! MM.
 MM.

05:03.934 --> 05:06.607
MMM.
 MMM.

05:06.607 --> 05:07.908
(gasps) IT'S THE RING!

05:07.908 --> 05:10.741
OH, YOU WENT BACK
TO THAT ANTIQUE SHOP.

05:10.741 --> 05:11.912
YEP.

05:11.912 --> 05:14.645
OH, THANK YOU! MWAH.
 MM.

05:14.645 --> 05:16.647
WAIT TILL YOU SEE
YOUR PRESENT.

05:16.647 --> 05:19.049
YOU CAN UNWRAP IT TONIGHT
WHEN THE KIDS ARE ASLEEP.

05:19.049 --> 05:22.393
(whispers) OR HOW ABOUT
AFTER THEY LEAVE FOR SCHOOL?

05:22.393 --> 05:23.924
(laughs) OKAY.
 (chuckles)

05:23.924 --> 05:26.827
HEY,
WHY ARE THEY STILL UP THERE

05:26.827 --> 05:29.730
AND WHY CAN'T I HEAR THEM?

05:39.109 --> 05:40.571
HEY, BOYS.

05:42.342 --> 05:43.974
WHAT'S GOING ON?

05:43.974 --> 05:48.118
UH, WE'RE LATE FOR SCHOOL.

06:01.031 --> 06:03.033
(gasps)

06:03.033 --> 06:05.035
OH!

06:05.035 --> 06:07.938
OH, HEY, LYNETTE.

06:07.938 --> 06:10.571
HI. THE NEXT TIME
YOU TAKE A SHOWER,

06:10.571 --> 06:13.073
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD
CLOSE YOUR BLINDS?

06:13.073 --> 06:16.006
I HAVE A 16-YEAR-OLD SON,
AND HE HAS FRIENDS.

06:16.006 --> 06:18.078
(sighs) OH, NO.

06:18.078 --> 06:20.581
OH, YES. YOU MAY HAVE RETIRED
FROM THE STRIP CLUB,

06:20.581 --> 06:24.715
BUT YOU'RE STILL DOING
SEVEN SHOWS A WEEK.
 I MEAN, AT LEAST THEY DIDN'T
HAVE TO PAY A COVER CHARGE.

06:24.715 --> 06:25.986
RIGHT? (laughs)

06:25.986 --> 06:27.988
THIS IS A NICE COMMUNITY.

06:27.988 --> 06:30.691
YOU HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY
TO THE NEIGHBORS,

06:30.691 --> 06:32.763
ESPECIALLY THE ONES
WITH INNOCENT CHILDREN.

06:34.425 --> 06:36.997
WELL, THEY'RE NOT ALL
 SO INNOCENT.

06:36.997 --> 06:39.169
EXCUSE ME?

06:39.169 --> 06:41.972
YESTERDAY THAT SON OF YOURS

06:41.972 --> 06:45.035
ASKED ME
IF I WOULD HAVE SEX WITH HIM.

06:45.035 --> 06:48.008
PARKER?

06:48.008 --> 06:49.610
MY PARKER?

06:49.610 --> 06:51.411
RED HAIR, SKINNY,

06:51.411 --> 06:54.414
STILL-SLEEPS-IN-A-BED-SHAPED-
LIKE-A-RACECAR PARKER?

06:54.414 --> 06:56.987
OF COURSE I SAID NO.

06:56.987 --> 06:58.449
(inhales deeply)

06:58.449 --> 07:01.492
THEN HE OFFERED ME CASH.

07:04.825 --> 07:06.126
HEY.

07:06.126 --> 07:07.658
(door closes)

07:07.658 --> 07:09.630
COME IN.

07:09.630 --> 07:11.762
HAVE A SEAT.

07:11.762 --> 07:13.103
WHAT'S UP?

07:13.103 --> 07:15.636
SOMETHING WRONG?

07:15.636 --> 07:17.638
WE HOPED IT WOULD BE
ANOTHER YEAR

07:17.638 --> 07:19.670
BEFORE WE HAD
THE PARENT-SON CONVERSATION

07:19.670 --> 07:23.113
WHERE WE TELL YOU NOT TO OFFER
YOUR NEIGHBOR MONEY FOR SEX.

07:23.113 --> 07:24.945
BUT...

07:24.945 --> 07:26.777
OH, CRAP. SHE TOLD?

07:26.777 --> 07:28.148
YEAH.

07:28.148 --> 07:31.151
YOU MIGHT WANT TO PICK A MORE
DISCREET STRIPPER NEXT TIME.

07:31.151 --> 07:33.153
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

07:33.153 --> 07:36.126
WE RAISED YOU BETTER
THAN THAT. DIDN'T WE?
 YEAH, WE DID.

07:36.126 --> 07:39.089
WE DID. SO... WHAT DO YOU
HAVE TO SAY FOR YOURSELF?

07:41.592 --> 07:47.037
(sighs) I JUST
REALLY, REALLY, REALLY...

07:47.037 --> 07:48.799
NEEDED TO HAVE SEX.

07:48.799 --> 07:52.202
THREE "REALLYs."
WELL, IN THAT CASE,

07:52.202 --> 07:54.945
HERE'S A $20.
GO BACK AND TRY AGAIN.

07:54.945 --> 07:56.146
(slap)
 WH--

07:56.146 --> 07:59.109
YOU ARE A 16-YEAR-OLD BOY.

07:59.109 --> 08:02.052
WE UNDERSTAND YOUR HORMONES ARE
HOLDING YOUR BRAIN HOSTAGE,

08:02.052 --> 08:05.055
BUT WHY WOULD YOU THINK
YOU WOULD NEED TO PAY FOR SEX?

08:05.055 --> 08:07.588
BECAUSE I'M THE ONLY ONE
OF MY FRIENDS

08:07.588 --> 08:11.061
WHO HASN'T LOST HIS VIRGINITY.
 (chuckles) OH. FIRST OF ALL,
WE'VE SEEN YOUR FRIENDS,

08:11.061 --> 08:13.063
AND TRUST ME,
"PIMPLES," "BRACES"

08:13.063 --> 08:15.766
AND "BEAM ME UP, SCOTTY"
ARE NOT GETTIN' ANY.

08:15.766 --> 08:17.768
GIRLS DON'T LOOK AT ME
THAT WAY.

08:17.768 --> 08:19.730
IT'S NEVER GONNA HAPPEN.

08:19.730 --> 08:22.132
(sighs)

08:24.575 --> 08:27.007
HEY.

08:28.809 --> 08:30.010
KNOCK IT OFF!

08:30.010 --> 08:33.043
YOU ARE A GREAT KID!

08:33.043 --> 08:35.916
YOU DON'T NEED TO PAY
FOR IT.

08:35.916 --> 08:37.688
IN A FEW YEARS,

08:37.688 --> 08:39.549
WHEN YOU'RE
EMOTIONALLY READY,

08:39.549 --> 08:42.052
YOU'LL MEET THE RIGHT GIRL,

08:42.052 --> 08:44.124
AND YOU WILL HAVE TONS OF SEX.

08:44.124 --> 08:45.896
(slap)
 AFTER YOU'RE MARRIED.

08:45.896 --> 08:47.998
OKAY, DAD.

08:47.998 --> 08:49.700
SORRY.

08:57.037 --> 08:59.640
NICE JOB.

08:59.640 --> 09:01.672
THANK YOU.

09:01.672 --> 09:03.674
YOU THINK HE BOUGHT IT?

09:03.674 --> 09:05.545
BOUGHT WHAT?

09:05.545 --> 09:07.578
YOU KNOW.

09:07.578 --> 09:09.580
MNH-MNH.

09:09.580 --> 09:12.152
GUYS ALWAYS PAY FOR SEX
IN SOME WAY--

09:12.152 --> 09:15.055
I MEAN, DINNER, FLOWERS...

09:15.055 --> 09:18.889
(chuckles) ANTIQUE RINGS.

09:18.889 --> 09:21.131
WHOA. WHOA.

09:21.131 --> 09:24.094
YOU THINK THAT'S THE ONLY REASON
WE'RE HAVING SEX TONIGHT?

09:24.094 --> 09:26.296
OF COURSE NOT.
IT'S OUR ANNIVERSARY.

09:26.296 --> 09:28.799
IT'S A GIVEN,
LIKE TURKEY ON THANKSGIVING.

09:28.799 --> 09:30.100
ALTHOUGH I AM HOPING

09:30.100 --> 09:33.143
THAT THE RING GETS ME
AN UPGRADE FROM MISSIONARY.

09:33.143 --> 09:36.106
FORGET ABOUT UPGRADES. YOU JUST
GOT BUMPED OFF THE FLIGHT.

09:36.106 --> 09:39.579
HONEY, WH--
WHY ARE YOU GETTING SO UPSET?

09:39.579 --> 09:41.581
BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW
I WAS MARRIED

09:41.581 --> 09:43.954
TO SUCH A CYNICAL LUG NUT.

09:43.954 --> 09:47.017
WAIT. ARE WE REALLY
NOT GONNA HAVE SEX TONIGHT?

09:47.017 --> 09:48.588
DON'T WORRY, TOM.

09:48.588 --> 09:50.891
IN A FEW YEARS,
WHEN YOU'RE EMOTIONALLY READY,

09:50.891 --> 09:52.893
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
 TONS OF SEX.

09:55.666 --> 09:58.328
COME ON!

10:03.133 --> 10:05.135
SO YOU REALLY LIKE
THAT RING?

10:05.135 --> 10:06.306
YEP.

10:06.306 --> 10:07.978
MM-HMM. (chuckles)

10:09.880 --> 10:12.242
DID YOU READ
THE INSCRIPTION?

10:12.242 --> 10:13.944
"TO MY DARLING--"

10:13.944 --> 10:15.916
WE'RE NOT HAVING SEX, TOM.

10:15.916 --> 10:19.019
OH, COME ON. WHY NOT?

10:19.019 --> 10:22.192
BECAUSE I AM STILL UPSET
BY WHAT YOU SAID.

10:22.192 --> 10:25.195
DO YOU REALLY THINK WOMEN
ONLY SLEEP WITH MEN

10:25.195 --> 10:27.097
IF THEY BUY THEM THINGS?

10:27.097 --> 10:30.260
NO. I THINK SUPERMODELS SLEEP
WITH 80-YEAR-OLD MILLIONAIRES

10:30.260 --> 10:32.262
BECAUSE THEY LOVE
TO HEAR STORIES

10:32.262 --> 10:34.835
ABOUT WHEN BREAD WAS
5 CENTS A LOAF.

10:34.835 --> 10:37.167
WELL, I'M NOT A MODEL,
AND YOU'RE NO MILLIONAIRE,

10:37.167 --> 10:40.040
SO I'M THINKING
YOU OWE ME AN APOLOGY.

10:40.040 --> 10:42.042
YOU AND I WENT
TO MARLEY'S TAVERN

10:42.042 --> 10:44.044
ON OUR FIRST TWO DATES,

10:44.044 --> 10:47.047
AND I COULD BARELY GET PAST
A GOOD NIGHT KISS.

10:47.047 --> 10:50.050
BUT THIRD TIME OUT, I DROPPED
200 BUCKS AT LA RIVE GAUCHE,

10:50.050 --> 10:53.724
AND BAM!
YOU FINALLY PUT OUT.

10:53.724 --> 10:56.026
FINALLY MADE LOVE.

10:56.026 --> 10:58.128
LISTEN, YOU IDIOT!

10:58.128 --> 10:59.429
(groans)

11:01.331 --> 11:06.196
I DID NOT "PUT OUT" BECAUSE YOU
BOUGHT ME AN EXPENSIVE DINNER.

11:06.196 --> 11:09.169
I DID IT BECAUSE YOU SHOWED UP
FOR THE DATE WITH A LIGHTBULB

11:09.169 --> 11:11.702
TO REPLACE THE ONE
THAT HAD BURNED OUT

11:11.702 --> 11:14.074
IN THE HALLWAY TO MY APARTMENT.
REMEMBER?

11:14.074 --> 11:17.708
OH.
 YOU SAID I DIDN'T LIVE
IN THE BEST NEIGHBORHOOD.

11:17.708 --> 11:19.710

11:19.710 --> 11:24.084

HEY, ROBIN.

11:48.408 --> 11:50.110

11:50.110 --> 11:52.442

A NICE NEIGHBORHOOD?

11:52.442 --> 11:54.444

11:54.444 --> 11:57.047
THERE'S THIS ONE BITCH

11:57.047 --> 11:59.049

12:01.151 --> 12:04.124
AN EX-STRIPPER MOVING NEXT DOOR
WILL FREAK SOME PEOPLE OUT.

12:04.124 --> 12:07.157
NO. SERIOUSLY, I'M SORRY.

12:07.157 --> 12:10.100
APOLOGY ACCEPTED.

12:13.403 --> 12:16.266
OH, AND, UH, BY THE WAY...

12:16.266 --> 12:18.168
OH. YEAH?

12:18.168 --> 12:20.871
THE NEXT TIME YOU'RE
GIVING IT TO YOUR HUSBAND

12:20.871 --> 12:23.413

DO YOU KNOW ABOUT CAKES?

IF YOU'RE GONNA HIDE IN ONE

14:07.347 --> 14:09.349

14:09.349 --> 14:11.982

14:21.291 --> 14:23.293
NOW THE KEY TO SUCCESS

14:23.293 --> 14:26.466
IS FOLLOWING THE RECIPE
EXACTLY.

14:26.466 --> 14:28.468
THE SECRET TO BAKING
IS PRECISION.

14:28.468 --> 14:30.901

14:55.125 --> 14:58.198
I TALKED TO HIM AT THE PARTY.
HE'S NICE.

14:58.198 --> 15:00.330
IT MUST BE TOUGH
HAVING HIM IN A WHEELCHAIR.

15:00.330 --> 15:02.602
IT'S BEEN CHALLENGING.

15:02.602 --> 15:04.604
WELL, THEY SAY YOU CAN
GET THROUGH ANYTHING

15:04.604 --> 15:06.676

A SOLID MARRIAGE.

15:06.676 --> 15:09.079
YES, WELL...

15:10.210 --> 15:13.083
OH. I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO PRY.

15:13.083 --> 15:14.344
IT'S FINE.

15:14.344 --> 15:17.047
LET'S JUST SAY BEFORE
HIS ACCIDENT THERE WERE ISSUES,

15:17.047 --> 15:20.050
AND NOW WE'RE TRYING TO PUT
THE PIECES BACK TOGETHER.

15:20.050 --> 15:22.052

15:29.960 --> 15:32.702
LOOK, MY GRANDMOTHER
ALWAYS SAID

15:32.702 --> 15:34.704
THAT IF YOU WANNA SAVE
YOUR MARRIAGE,

15:34.704 --> 15:38.108
THERE'S ONLY ONE ROOM
TO DO IT IN.

15:38.108 --> 15:39.609
THE BEDROOM.

15:39.609 --> 15:41.611
YEAH, I GOT THAT.

15:41.611 --> 15:44.414
IT'S NOT ABOUT SEX.

15:44.414 --> 15:46.276
IT'S ABOUT... CLOSENESS.

15:46.276 --> 15:49.249
WE'VE LOST OUR INTIMACY.

15:49.249 --> 15:51.221
OH. HONEY. (chuckles)

15:51.221 --> 15:53.283
SEX IS HOW MEN GET INTIMATE.

15:53.283 --> 15:56.556

HE'S CAPABLE.

15:56.556 --> 15:58.228
OH, IT DOESN'T MATTER.

15:58.228 --> 16:00.090
HIS BRAIN STILL WORKS.

16:00.090 --> 16:03.193
AND HE CAN SEE YOU.
HE CAN FEEL YOU TOUCH HIM.

16:03.193 --> 16:05.535
HE CAN HEAR
WHAT YOU SAY TO HIM.

16:05.535 --> 16:07.537

THIS REGULAR CUSTOMER--

16:07.537 --> 16:09.539
92 YEARS OLD,
IN A WHEELCHAIR.

16:09.539 --> 16:12.602

22:43.863 --> 22:46.135
(mockingly) "DANNY AND I
ARE MOVING TO NEW YORK

22:46.135 --> 22:48.137
"AFTER I GRADUATE.
WE'RE IN LOVE!

22:48.137 --> 22:49.769
MWAH! MWAH! MWAH! MWAH!"
UGH!

22:49.769 --> 22:53.002
POUR ME SOME MORE WINE
BEFORE I THROW UP.
 WHAT'S WRONG?

22:53.002 --> 22:56.005
OH, GABY GOT HER NIECE A FOOT IN
THE DOOR FOR A MODELING CAREER,

22:56.005 --> 22:58.778
AND SHE'S TURNING IT DOWN.
 OOH, BAD CALL.

22:58.778 --> 23:01.881
I USED TO TAKE BALLET, AND I
WAS PRETTY GOOD AT IT, TOO.

23:01.881 --> 23:05.084
AND ONE TIME, THIS INSTRUCTOR
FROM A BIG BALLET COMPANY

23:05.084 --> 23:07.386
SAW ME PERFORM,
AND--OH, LONG STORY SHORT,

23:07.386 --> 23:10.019
TWO DAYS LATER
THEY OFFERED ME A JOB.

23:10.019 --> 23:11.521
WHAT HAPPENED?

23:11.521 --> 23:13.593
BOBBY BUTTERFIELD HAPPENED.

23:13.593 --> 23:16.496
A BOY.
 NOT JUST A BOY.

23:16.496 --> 23:17.467
THE BOY.

23:17.467 --> 23:19.769
OH, I WAS CRAZY ABOUT HIM,

23:19.769 --> 23:21.771
THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA
LAST FOREVER.

23:21.771 --> 23:23.773
SO I PASSED ON THE JOB.

23:23.773 --> 23:26.536
AND TWO MONTHS LATER, HE DUMPED
ME FOR LOUISE McMULLEN.

23:26.536 --> 23:28.908
AND THEN A MONTH AFTER THAT,
I GOT INTO A CAR ACCIDENT,

23:28.908 --> 23:30.580
MESSED UP MY KNEE,

23:30.580 --> 23:33.883
AND THEN IT WAS GOOD-BYE, TUTU.
HELLO TA-TAS.

23:33.883 --> 23:35.184
(clicks tongue) OH.

23:35.184 --> 23:37.687
THAT IS FANTASTIC!

23:37.687 --> 23:39.689
DID WE JUST HEAR
THE SAME STORY?

23:39.689 --> 23:41.851
YOU HAVE GOT
TO TELL THAT STORY TO ANA.

23:41.851 --> 23:43.152
PUTTING OFF YOUR DREAMS

23:43.152 --> 23:45.695
AND THEN HAVING YOUR LIFE
SPIRAL DOWN THE CRAPPER?

23:45.695 --> 23:47.697
IT COULDN'T BE MORE PERFECT.

23:47.697 --> 23:50.960
WELL, I-I GUESS
I COULD TALK TO ANA,

23:50.960 --> 23:53.463
IF YOU THINK
IT WOULD HELP HER.

23:53.463 --> 23:55.965
GREAT. AND DON'T BE AFRAID
TO TURN ON THE WATERWORKS.

23:55.965 --> 23:58.508
NOTHIN' SELLS PATHETIC
LIKE STRIPPER TEARS.

23:58.508 --> 24:00.510
(lowered voice)
MAYBE IT WOULD HELP

24:00.510 --> 24:02.171
IF I STARTED TAPING YOU

24:02.171 --> 24:05.715
SO YOU COULD HEAR
WHAT IT IS YOU SAY.

24:07.176 --> 24:08.678
DON'T BE DISCOURAGED

24:08.678 --> 24:11.180
IF LUKE STARTS YOU OFF
WITH CATALOGUE WORK.

24:11.180 --> 24:13.182
JUST TRY TO GET YOUR FACE
IN THE SHOT.

24:13.182 --> 24:16.455
A LITTLE TOUGH TO DO WITH
A LAWN MOWER, BUT I DID IT.
 HEY. ANA. WHERE YOU BEEN?

24:16.455 --> 24:19.158
I WAS TEXTING YOU.
 OH, I WAS JUST COMING OVER.

24:19.158 --> 24:21.561
OOH. TAKING A TRIP?
(chuckles)

24:21.561 --> 24:25.234
I'M... SURE YOU TWO HAVE
A LOT TO TALK ABOUT.

24:25.234 --> 24:27.537
SO I'LL JUST TAKE THESE INSIDE
FOR YOU.

24:27.537 --> 24:29.899
BYE, DANNY.

24:29.899 --> 24:32.241
WHAT DO YOU
NEED LUGGAGE FOR?

24:34.644 --> 24:37.647
(Ana) I WAS JUST ABOUT TO COME
OVER AND TELL YOU RIGHT NOW.

24:37.647 --> 24:39.779
WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN?
 I JUST FOUND OUT, OKAY?

24:39.779 --> 24:42.481
ANA, I THOUGHT WE WERE
SUPPOSED TO GO TOGETHER.

24:42.481 --> 24:45.484
WHY CAN'T YOU WAIT?
 THIS IS A HUGE OPPORTUNITY.

24:45.484 --> 24:48.187
YOU SHOULD BE SAYING,
"GREAT, ANA. GO FOR IT."

24:48.187 --> 24:50.189
IF YOU CAN'T SUPPORT ME,

24:50.189 --> 24:54.223
THEN MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T
EVEN BE TOGETHER.

24:55.695 --> 24:57.226
HEY! HEY, ROBIN!

24:57.226 --> 24:59.228
OH, HI. WHAT'S UP?

24:59.228 --> 25:01.500
I'VE BEEN MEANING
TO THANK YOU.

25:01.500 --> 25:03.803
YOU LITTLE SPEECH TO ANA
WORKED LIKE A CHARM.

25:03.803 --> 25:05.805
I JUST TOOK HER
TO THE AIRPORT.
 GREAT.

25:05.805 --> 25:08.738
MM-HMM.
 SO, UH, WHY WAS SHE FIGHTING
WITH DANNY BOLEN YESTERDAY?

25:08.738 --> 25:10.610
THEY WERE BREAKING UP.

25:10.610 --> 25:12.181
THEY WERE DATING?

25:12.181 --> 25:15.044
YEAH. THAT'S THE WHOLE REASON
I WANTED YOU TO TALK TO HER,

25:15.044 --> 25:17.046
TO CONVINCE HER SHE WAS
SCREWING UP HER LIFE,

25:17.046 --> 25:19.589
SO I COULD SHIP HER OFF
TO NEW YORK

25:19.589 --> 25:23.522
AND GET HER AWAY FROM DANNY.
 (chuckles nervously)
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME THAT.

25:23.522 --> 25:25.124
OKAY. SO?

25:25.124 --> 25:28.628
SO I DON'T LIKE BEING USED.
 OH, DON'T GET UPSET.
YOU DID GOOD.

25:28.628 --> 25:30.630
ANA'S GONE.
DANNY'S OUT OF THE PICTURE.

25:30.630 --> 25:32.732
I OWE YA BIG TIME.

25:34.533 --> 25:36.035
(sighs)

25:41.871 --> 25:43.212
DANNY.

25:43.212 --> 25:45.274
HEY, I THINK
WE NEED TO TALK.

25:45.274 --> 25:47.777
SORRY. IT'S REALLY NOT
A GOOD TIME.

25:47.777 --> 25:52.151
ACTUALLY, THIS IS
EXACTLY THE TIME.

25:53.853 --> 25:55.955
(tool clatters)

25:55.955 --> 25:57.787
(beep)
 I JUST TALKED TO LUKE.

25:57.787 --> 25:59.789
ANA HAS SETTLED INTO HER DORM,

25:59.789 --> 26:02.031
SHE'S GOT ALL HER CLASSES
LINED UP,

26:02.031 --> 26:04.634
AND HE'S TAKING
HER NEW HEAD SHOTS TOMORROW.

26:04.634 --> 26:06.636
AND THE BEST PART IS,

26:06.636 --> 26:08.968
SHE IS MILES AWAY
FROM THE NEAREST BOLEN.

26:08.968 --> 26:11.170
(clink)

26:18.948 --> 26:20.680
(car door closes)

26:33.222 --> 26:35.625
OH, PERFECT TIMING.

26:37.126 --> 26:38.798
SOMETHING SMELLS GOOD.

26:38.798 --> 26:40.129
THANK YOU.

26:40.129 --> 26:42.271
JUST PUTTING ON THE FINISHING
TOUCHES BEFORE WE EAT.

26:42.271 --> 26:43.833
BON APPéTIT.

26:43.833 --> 26:46.676
OH, YOU SPOIL ME. (kisses)
 MM. (chuckles)

26:46.676 --> 26:48.978
MM! (grunts)
 WHAT'S WRONG?
IS IT YOUR BACK AGAIN?

26:48.978 --> 26:51.610
YEAH. I SPENT ALL DAY
WORKING IN A CRAWL SPACE.

26:51.610 --> 26:54.283
AW. I'LL CALL THE CHIROPRACTOR
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING.

26:54.283 --> 26:57.046
NO NEED FOR THAT.
I CAN FIX IT. (chuckles)

26:57.046 --> 26:58.888
COME HERE. (clears throat)
 OW!

26:58.888 --> 27:01.891
OH, WAIT! WAIT! WAIT! WAIT!
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?
 AT DOUBLE D's,

27:01.891 --> 27:03.893
THE GIRLS WERE CONSTANTLY
THROWING THEIR BACKS OUT

27:03.893 --> 27:06.896
FROM SLIDING DOWN THAT POLE.
THEY ALL CAME TO SEE ME.

27:06.896 --> 27:09.859
NOW JUST RELAX,
AND ONE, TWO, THREE.

27:09.859 --> 27:11.661
(bones crunch)
 (grunts)

27:11.661 --> 27:13.663
THERE. HOW DO YOU FEEL?

27:13.663 --> 27:16.335
OH, MY GOD. IT'S GONE.

27:16.335 --> 27:18.007
(chuckles) THE PAIN'S GONE.

27:18.007 --> 27:19.939
WOW! UH, THANK YOU, ROBIN.

27:19.939 --> 27:21.941
I-I WAS JUST GONNA
GIVE HIM A SCOTCH

27:21.941 --> 27:23.943
AND MAKE HIM SLEEP
THE GUEST ROOM.

27:23.943 --> 27:26.415
(laughs) SERIOUSLY,
YOU REALLY FIXED ME UP.

27:26.415 --> 27:28.117
THANKS.
 OH, PLEASE.

27:28.117 --> 27:31.380
AFTER ALL YOU GUYS HAVE DONE
FOR ME, IT'S THE LEAST I CAN DO.

27:31.380 --> 27:33.382
(both laugh)

27:36.085 --> 27:38.688
I'M HOME!

27:38.688 --> 27:40.730
(Mike) IN HERE!

27:40.730 --> 27:42.231
NO FAST FOOD TONIGHT!

27:42.231 --> 27:45.434
FIRE UP THE...

27:45.434 --> 27:47.436
MICROWAVE.

27:47.436 --> 27:50.369
HEY.
 MY BACK WENT OUT AGAIN.

27:50.369 --> 27:53.803
ROBIN TRIED CRACKING IT, BUT IT
JUST DIDN'T GO DEEP ENOUGH.

27:53.803 --> 27:55.805
THIS IS THE WAY
THE BUDDHIST MONKS DO IT.

27:55.805 --> 27:58.748
IT'S THE ONLY WAY
TO GET THROUGH ALL THAT MUSCLE.

27:58.748 --> 28:01.310
IS THERE A PROBLEM, BABE?

28:01.310 --> 28:04.283
NO. (chuckles) NO PROBLEM.

28:04.283 --> 28:06.015
(laughs)
 MM!

28:06.015 --> 28:08.317
IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE IN GOOD HANDS.

28:08.317 --> 28:10.189
OR... (chuckles) FEET.

28:10.189 --> 28:13.092
SO I'LL JUST, UH,
GO MAKE DINNER.

28:13.092 --> 28:15.094
HAPPY TRAILS!

28:16.695 --> 28:19.068
(Robin)
HOW DOES THAT FEEL?

28:19.068 --> 28:22.401
(Mike) OH! YEAH, YEAH,
DO THAT! DO THAT!

28:22.401 --> 28:25.775
CAN YOU HANDLE A LITTLE MORE?
 OH! GIVE ME ALL YOU GOT.

28:25.775 --> 28:28.377
(loudly) SO I, UH,
RAN INTO JANICE WHITE TODAY.

28:28.377 --> 28:30.379
SAYS HER HUSBAND IS SICK.

28:30.379 --> 28:32.381
OH, WOW,
YOU'RE REALLY STIFF.
 (moans)

28:32.381 --> 28:34.383
OKAY, LET ME TRY
SOMETHING ELSE.

28:34.383 --> 28:36.315
OH, YOU'RE THE BOSS.

28:36.315 --> 28:37.817
APPARENTLY, IT'S BACTERIAL,

28:37.817 --> 28:40.449
AND HE'S, UH,
BLOATING LIKE A PIG.

28:40.449 --> 28:42.491
I'M GONNA GRAB IT
AND PULL.

28:42.491 --> 28:44.353
GO FOR IT!

28:44.353 --> 28:46.455
AND THERE'S A LOT OF DIARRHEA!

28:46.455 --> 28:50.800
OH, YES! OHH! YES!

28:50.800 --> 28:53.462
OHH, YES!
 (gasps)

28:53.462 --> 28:55.464
THIS IS INCREDIBLE.

28:55.464 --> 28:57.907
THOSE MONKS REALLY KNOW
WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

28:57.907 --> 29:00.069
OH, YEAH.

29:00.069 --> 29:02.441
WHEN DO THEY FIND TIME
TO PRAY?

29:02.441 --> 29:05.274
(chuckles nervously)

29:07.476 --> 29:10.119
HEY! I'M ON MY WAY
TO SCHOOL.

29:10.119 --> 29:13.052
THE FACULTY VOLUNTEERED TO MAKE
SANDWICHES FOR THE HOMELESS.

29:13.052 --> 29:16.826
OKAY, WELL, I'LL, UH,
SEE YOU LATER. (groans)

29:16.826 --> 29:18.287
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

29:18.287 --> 29:21.791
I, UH, RE-PIPED AN ENTIRE HOUSE.
EVEN MY HAIR HURTS.

29:21.791 --> 29:25.064
AW, YOU POOR THING.
YOU WANT THE HEATING PAD?
 NO. NO, I'LL BE OKAY.

29:25.064 --> 29:27.196
WELL, I WON'T BE GONE LONG.
FEEL BETTER.

29:27.196 --> 29:30.099
(kisses)
 I'LL JUST HAVE ROBIN CRACK
MY BACK WHEN SHE GETS HOME.

29:30.099 --> 29:32.902
OR I COULD STAY HERE
AND DO IT.

29:32.902 --> 29:35.274
WHAT ABOUT THE HOMELESS?

29:35.274 --> 29:38.147
PLEASE. THEY'VE GONE THIS LONG
WITHOUT FOOD.

29:38.147 --> 29:39.809
WHAT'S ANOTHER TEN MINUTES?

29:39.809 --> 29:43.853
SUSAN, DO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH ROBIN WORKING ON ME?

29:43.853 --> 29:45.514
OF COURSE NOT.

29:45.514 --> 29:48.357
BUT SHE'S NOT HERE,
AND YOU'RE IN PAIN.

29:48.357 --> 29:51.460
SO WHY DON'T YOU LET ME
TAKE A SHOT AT IT?

29:51.460 --> 29:53.462
A SHOT AT IT?
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MY SPINE.

29:53.462 --> 29:56.395
MIKE, ROBIN DIDN'T EXACTLY
GO TO MEDICAL SCHOOL

29:56.395 --> 29:58.067
BETWEEN LAP DANCES.

29:58.067 --> 30:01.400
I SAW WHAT SHE DID.
I CAN DO THE SAME THING.
 (sighs)

30:01.400 --> 30:03.472
OKAY.
 HERE WE GO.

30:03.472 --> 30:07.276
OW!
 OW? NO "OW." THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT ROBIN DID.

30:07.276 --> 30:09.278
NO, SHE DIDN'T YANK IT.

30:09.278 --> 30:11.280
IT'S MY ARM,
NOT AN EMERGENCY BRAKE.

30:11.280 --> 30:13.282
SHH. JUST TAKE A DEEP BREATH.
 (sighs)

30:13.282 --> 30:15.314
THE KEY IS RELAXATION.
OKAY.

30:15.314 --> 30:16.485
ONE...

30:16.485 --> 30:18.017
TWO...

30:20.819 --> 30:24.223
YOU KNOW, IF YOU HADN'T MOVED
WHEN I SAID "THREE"...

30:24.223 --> 30:27.256
JUST GO.

30:35.234 --> 30:38.337
OH, MY GOD, SUSAN.
IS MIKE GONNA BE ALL RIGHT?

30:38.337 --> 30:41.610
CAN I SEE HIM?
 SURE, SWEETIE.

30:41.610 --> 30:45.444
JUST DON'T CLIMB ON THE BED.
(chuckles)

30:48.017 --> 30:50.019
LOOK, WHY DIDN'T YOU WAIT
FOR ME?

30:50.019 --> 30:53.022
I WOULD'VE TAKEN CARE
OF MIKE'S BACK, NO PROBLEM.

30:53.022 --> 30:55.424
WELL, I WANTED
TO DO IT MYSELF.

30:55.424 --> 30:57.456
OH. OKAY. HMM.

30:59.288 --> 31:01.360
I'M LYING.
I DIDN'T WANNA DO IT.

31:01.360 --> 31:04.533
I JUST REALLY
WANTED YOU NOT TO DO IT.

31:04.533 --> 31:07.536
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

31:07.536 --> 31:12.571
GOD, I'VE BEEN TRYING REALLY
HARD TO BE COOL ABOUT ALL THIS.

31:12.571 --> 31:17.646
BUT WHEN I WALKED IN
AND I SAW YOU ALL OVER MIKE...

31:17.646 --> 31:21.210
WHEN--WHEN I WAS
CRACKING HIS BACK?

31:21.210 --> 31:23.212
I WAS JUST TRYING TO HELP.

31:23.212 --> 31:25.414
WHILE YOU WEARING
NEXT TO NOTHING

31:25.414 --> 31:27.416
AND STRADDLING MY HUSBAND.

31:27.416 --> 31:31.020
HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO REACT?
YOU USED TO BE A STRIPPER.

31:31.020 --> 31:35.424
(gasps)

31:35.424 --> 31:37.426
OH, DON'T CRY.
WHY ARE YOU CRYING?

31:37.426 --> 31:39.628
STRIPPERS ARE SUPPOSED
TO BE TOUGH.

31:39.628 --> 31:41.370
STOP CALLING ME THAT.

31:41.370 --> 31:45.574
YES, I WAS A STRIPPER.

31:45.574 --> 31:47.276
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

31:47.276 --> 31:50.339
YOU WERE THE ONLY PERSON
WHO NEVER TREATED ME LIKE ONE,

31:50.339 --> 31:52.181
UNTIL NOW.
 OH.

31:52.181 --> 31:55.184
AND I'M REALLY SORRY
IF I CROSSED THE LINE WITH MIKE.

31:55.184 --> 31:58.187
YOU KNOW, I GUESS AFTER
WORKING NINE YEARS IN THE CLUB,

31:58.187 --> 32:01.150
I JUST DON'T KNOW
WHERE THE LINE IS ANYMORE.

32:01.150 --> 32:03.352
UH, IT'S...

32:03.352 --> 32:04.923
I-I OVERREACTED.

32:07.426 --> 32:09.558
MAYBE I SHOULD MOVE OUT.

32:09.558 --> 32:12.962
NO. ROBIN, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DO THAT.

32:15.264 --> 32:18.367
I WANT US TO BE FRIENDS
FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

32:18.367 --> 32:20.669
SO, YES, I DO.

32:22.511 --> 32:25.444
(Mike) OHH!

32:25.444 --> 32:29.018
DADDY NEEDS HELP
MAKING THE BED GO BACK DOWN.

32:42.691 --> 32:44.733
HELLO.

32:44.733 --> 32:48.097
HI. SUSAN ASKED ME
TO BRING YOU SOME OF YOUR MAIL.

32:48.097 --> 32:50.399
OH, THANK YOU.

32:50.399 --> 32:52.401
I'M ROBIN.
WE MET AT YOUR PARTY.

32:52.401 --> 32:55.074
YEAH, I REMEMBER.

32:55.074 --> 32:56.575
HOW'S IT GOING?

32:56.575 --> 32:59.578
OH! I TAKE IT YOU HEARD
ABOUT MY LITTLE VACATION

32:59.578 --> 33:01.480
AT FAIRVIEW BEHAVIORAL.

33:01.480 --> 33:03.452
YES. I HEARD. (chuckles)

33:03.452 --> 33:05.354
WELL, TO BE HONEST,

33:05.354 --> 33:07.056
IT'S BEEN HARD,

33:07.056 --> 33:09.218
ESPECIALLY COMING BACK
TO THIS BIG, EMPTY HOUSE.

33:09.218 --> 33:11.220
NOT TO MENTION
THE SUBTLE GLANCES I GET

33:11.220 --> 33:12.721
FROM PEOPLE JUDGING ME.

33:12.721 --> 33:16.095
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I SAY?
TO HELL WITH THEM. (laughs)

33:16.095 --> 33:17.996
(laughs) THANK YOU.

33:17.996 --> 33:19.698
I'LL SEE YOU.

33:19.698 --> 33:23.402
OH, HEY, AND IF THIS HOUSE
GETS TOO LONELY,

33:23.402 --> 33:25.404
I'M LOOKING
FOR A ROOM TO RENT.

33:25.404 --> 33:27.376
I MEAN, MIKE AND SUSAN
ARE GREAT,

33:27.376 --> 33:29.538
BUT IT'S GETTIN'
A LITTLE CROWDED OVER THERE.

33:29.538 --> 33:32.341
OKAY, I'LL KEEP IT IN MIND.

33:32.341 --> 33:34.343
MM, FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,

33:34.343 --> 33:36.345
IT MIGHT TAKE THE HEAT
OFF OF YOU.

33:36.345 --> 33:38.347
NO ONE JUDGES
THE WOMAN FROM THE LOONEY BIN

33:38.347 --> 33:41.390
WHEN THERE'S A STRIPPER
NEXT DOOR.
 (laughs)

33:41.390 --> 33:43.552
(chuckles)

33:47.526 --> 33:49.598
THIS IS GREAT.

33:49.598 --> 33:52.401
I HAVEN'T HAD
A FEMALE ROOMMATE SINCE...

33:52.401 --> 33:53.532
AFTER COLLEGE.

33:53.532 --> 33:56.405
LET'S HEAR IT FOR GIRL POWER!
 (chuckles)

33:56.405 --> 33:59.438
YOU KNOW, WE SHOULD GO OUT
AND HAVE A DRINK TO CELEBRATE.

33:59.438 --> 34:01.170
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

34:01.170 --> 34:04.413
MY THERAPIST SAYS
I SHOULD GET OUT MORE, BUT...

34:04.413 --> 34:08.147
EVEN BEING OVER AT GABY'S HOUSE
THE OTHER DAY, IT'S...

34:08.147 --> 34:10.079
IT'S JUST HARD.

34:10.079 --> 34:12.081
YEAH, I GET THAT.

34:12.081 --> 34:15.053
SO WHAT WAS IT LIKE
BEING IN A MENTAL HOSPITAL?

34:19.658 --> 34:21.429
YOU KNOW...

34:21.429 --> 34:24.293
AS MUCH FUN
AS ONE WOULD EXPECT.

34:24.293 --> 34:26.364
I ONLY ASK
'CAUSE OF MY MOM.

34:26.364 --> 34:28.667
SHE USED TO USE ME
AS A PUNCHING BAG,

34:28.667 --> 34:31.570
AND I ALWAYS DREAMED
ABOUT HAVING HER COMMITTED.

34:31.570 --> 34:33.601
I'M SORRY.

34:33.601 --> 34:37.446
OH. NO, IT WAS ONLY
WHEN SHE WAS DRUNK.

34:37.446 --> 34:40.078
IT WAS HER WAY OF COPING

34:40.078 --> 34:42.080
WITH MY DAD CHEATING ON HER
ALL THE TIME.

34:42.080 --> 34:44.081
I REMEMBER WISHING
THAT HE WAS UGLY

34:44.081 --> 34:46.614
SO OTHER WOMEN
WOULDN'T WANT HIM.

34:46.614 --> 34:49.288
BUT HE LOOKED LIKE
CLINT EASTWOOD. (chuckles)

34:49.288 --> 34:52.860
ANYWAY, MOM HAD TO
TAKE OUT HER ANGER SOMEWHERE,

34:52.860 --> 34:57.426
AND I WAS AN EASIER TARGET
THAN A 6'4" TRUCKER.

34:59.528 --> 35:01.600
ACTUALLY...

35:01.600 --> 35:03.872
IT WAS PRETTY BAD
AT THE HOSPITAL.

35:03.872 --> 35:07.476
PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY IT'S
THE SCREAMING THAT GETS TO YOU.

35:09.808 --> 35:13.342
BUT AT LEAST SCREAMING
MEANS YOU'RE ALIVE, YOU KNOW?

35:15.444 --> 35:17.516
WHAT I COULDN'T TAKE

35:17.516 --> 35:21.490
WERE THE PEOPLE
WITH THE BLANK STARES.

35:21.490 --> 35:24.423
THERE WAS THIS ONE WOMAN

35:24.423 --> 35:28.257
WHO SAT FROZEN
IN THE GARDEN ALL DAY,

35:28.257 --> 35:31.630
WHISPERING THE WORDS
TO "OLD MacDONALD HAD A FARM"

35:31.630 --> 35:33.902
OVER AND OVER AND OVER.

35:33.902 --> 35:36.905
THE DOCTORS EVER TAKE OFFENSE
WHEN SHE GOT TO

35:36.905 --> 35:39.838
"HERE A QUACK, THERE A QUACK,
EVERYWHERE A QUACK-QUACK"?

35:43.242 --> 35:46.815
(laughs)

35:48.847 --> 35:50.519
YOU KNOW WHAT?

35:52.551 --> 35:54.553
IF THERE WERE EVER
TWO PEOPLE

35:54.553 --> 35:56.755
WHO DESERVED
A NIGHT OUT DRINKING...

35:56.755 --> 35:58.757
(whispers) IT'S US.

35:58.757 --> 36:00.459
OKAY...
 MM-HMM?

36:00.459 --> 36:02.761
QUID PRO QUO.
 MM?

36:02.761 --> 36:05.734
I TOLD YOU WHAT IT WAS LIKE
TO GO TO BED IN RESTRAINTS,

36:05.734 --> 36:07.736
SO I THINK IT'S ONLY FAIR

36:07.736 --> 36:10.739
THAT YOU TELL ME WHAT
IT WAS LIKE BEING A STRIPPER.

36:10.739 --> 36:12.441
OOH. IT WAS BRUTAL.

36:12.441 --> 36:15.544
IF I HAD A DOLLAR FOR EVERY GUY
THAT SLAPPED ME ON MY BUTT

36:15.544 --> 36:17.906
JUST 'CAUSE
HE FELT LIKE IT...

36:17.906 --> 36:20.449
COME TO THINK OF IT,
I DO.

36:20.449 --> 36:21.910
(both laugh)

36:21.910 --> 36:24.913
EXCUSE ME. UH, MY FRIEND AND I
WERE WONDERING

36:24.913 --> 36:27.916
IF YOU'D LIKE TO JOIN US
AT OUR TABLE.

36:27.916 --> 36:30.659
NO, THANK YOU.
IT'S GIRLS NIGHT OUT.

36:30.659 --> 36:34.493
TWO BEAUTIFUL WOMEN IN A BAR.
CAN'T BLAME A GUY FOR ASKING.

36:34.493 --> 36:35.624
MM.

36:35.624 --> 36:39.428
UH, WE'RE OVER THERE
IF YOU DECIDE TO GO COED.

36:39.428 --> 36:42.431
IS IT BAD THAT I WANNA
GO SIT WITH THEM?

36:42.431 --> 36:44.433
YOU DO?
 YEAH!

36:44.433 --> 36:48.537
IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE A GUY
THAT CUTE HAS FLIRTED WITH ME.

36:49.978 --> 36:51.980
YOU KNOW WHAT?
LET'S DO IT.

36:51.980 --> 36:54.443
REALLY?

36:54.443 --> 36:57.516
YES. YOU LOOK WAY TOO HOT TO
WASTE IT ON JUST ME. (chuckles)

36:57.516 --> 36:59.518
SHALL WE?
 MM!

36:59.518 --> 37:01.950
(giggles)

37:01.950 --> 37:04.523
COME ON.
YOU'VE GOTTA HAVE A SECRET.

37:04.523 --> 37:07.556
NOPE. IT'S SHAMPOO
AND CONDITIONER.
 WELL, IT LOOKS AMAZING.

37:07.556 --> 37:09.558
YOU SHOULD BE ON THE COVER
OF HAIR MAGAZINES.

37:09.558 --> 37:13.462
WHAT IS IT YOU SAID YOU DO?
 I DIDN'T,
BUT MY FRIEND KATHERINE

37:13.462 --> 37:16.535
IS STARTING
HER OWN CATERING COMPANY.
 OH, WELL, THINKING ABOUT IT.

37:16.535 --> 37:19.338
COOKING'S A PASSION OF MINE.

37:19.338 --> 37:22.571
BUT A LOT HAS TO HAPPEN
BEFORE I START MY OWN BUSINESS.

37:22.571 --> 37:23.542
OH.

37:23.542 --> 37:26.875
I KNOW. YOU'RE A MODEL.

37:26.875 --> 37:28.347
NO.

37:28.347 --> 37:29.848
OH. UH... DENTAL HYGIENIST?

37:29.848 --> 37:32.020
NO.

37:32.020 --> 37:34.523
OH, I KNOW.
YOU'RE A FLIGHT ATTENDANT.
 MNH-MNH.

37:34.523 --> 37:36.685
YOU MAY AS WELL TELL ME,

37:36.685 --> 37:39.758
OR I'M JUST GONNA
KEEP GUESSING ALL NIGHT.
 SHE'S A STRIPPER, OKAY?

37:41.530 --> 37:44.293
EX-STRIPPER. I'M SORRY.

37:44.293 --> 37:47.896
OH, HEY, WHY ARE YOU
APOLOGIZING? WE LOVE STRIPPERS.

37:47.896 --> 37:49.898
YEAH. THEY'RE LIKE
ANGELS OF MERCY...

37:49.898 --> 37:51.800
THAT SHOW THEIR BOOBS.

37:53.472 --> 37:55.974
WE SHOULD PROBABLY GET GOING.
(chuckles)

37:55.974 --> 37:59.508
W-WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
WE HAVEN'T EVEN DANCED YET.

37:59.508 --> 38:01.580
OH, I DON'T REALLY
FEEL LIKE DANCING,

38:01.580 --> 38:04.313
ALTHOUGH I CAN'T SPEAK
FOR KATHERINE HERE.

38:04.313 --> 38:06.485
WELL, IT'S JUST,
I WANNA DANCE WITH YOU.

38:06.485 --> 38:08.987
YOU'RE NOT ATTRACTED TO SOMEONE
WHO'S CLASSY, WITTY,

38:08.987 --> 38:11.620
NOT TO MENTION
BREATHTAKINGLY BEAUTIFUL?

38:11.620 --> 38:14.593
NO OFFENSE TO YOUR FRIEND,
BUT YOU'RE MORE MY TYPE.

38:14.593 --> 38:16.595
OH. WELL, IN THAT CASE,

38:16.595 --> 38:20.799
I GUESS I'LL JUST KEEP HER
ALL TO MYSELF.

38:20.799 --> 38:23.372
(gasps)

38:26.304 --> 38:28.306
NIGHT, GUYS.

38:32.541 --> 38:34.613
(gasps)

38:34.613 --> 38:36.485
GOD... (laughs)

38:36.485 --> 38:39.548
THE LOOK ON THEIR FACES...
 OH, I KNOW.

38:39.548 --> 38:42.551
IT WAS THE PERFECT COMBO
OF "I AM SO TURNED ON"

38:42.551 --> 38:44.853
AND "I AM SO GOING HOME ALONE."
(laughs)

38:44.853 --> 38:46.825
(laughs)
 YOU SHOULD REMEMBER THAT

38:46.825 --> 38:49.998
THE NEXT TIME YOU WANT
TO GET OUT OF A BAD DATE.

38:49.998 --> 38:52.060
OH, NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

38:52.060 --> 38:53.762
THOSE TWO PIGS CONFIRMED

38:53.762 --> 38:56.435
WHAT I'VE BEEN THINKING
FOR A WHILE NOW--

38:56.435 --> 38:59.438
I THINK IT'S TIME FOR ME
TO GIVE UP ON MEN.

38:59.438 --> 39:01.069
MM. AMEN, SISTER.

39:01.069 --> 39:02.441
(clink)

39:02.441 --> 39:04.613
IT'S OFFICIAL.
MY DATING DAYS ARE OVER.

39:04.613 --> 39:07.616
I MEAN, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO TAKE IT THAT FAR.

39:07.616 --> 39:09.618
YOU COULD ALWAYS
JUST DO WHAT I DID

39:09.618 --> 39:11.450
AND EXPLORE OTHER OPTIONS.

39:11.450 --> 39:14.082
(chuckles)
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

39:14.082 --> 39:16.955
CAST A WIDER NET?

39:16.955 --> 39:19.628
EXPAND THE POOL?

39:19.628 --> 39:22.360
DATE CHICKS?

39:22.360 --> 39:23.862
OH.

39:23.862 --> 39:25.734
(both chuckle)

39:25.734 --> 39:27.736
SO YOU'RE...

39:27.736 --> 39:28.967
YEP.

39:28.967 --> 39:31.540
CARD-CARRYING.

39:31.540 --> 39:33.542
HUH.

39:34.873 --> 39:39.448
I THOUGHT THAT KISS
FELT AWFULLY CONVINCING.

39:39.448 --> 39:43.512
WELL, I MEAN, I DATED GUYS
FOR A LONG TIME AND...

39:43.512 --> 39:45.514
I JUST NEVER REALLY FELT
A CONNECTION.

39:45.514 --> 39:47.516
AND THEN I STARTED STRIPPING,

39:47.516 --> 39:50.719
AND I WAS SURROUNDED BY
ALL THESE CONFIDENT, SEXY WOMEN,

39:50.719 --> 39:52.591
AND I REALIZED,

39:52.591 --> 39:55.994
"ROBIN, SWEETIE, YOU HAVE BEEN
BARKING UP THE WRONG TREE." HMM.

39:55.994 --> 39:59.397
YEAH, I THINK I GOT
THE RIGHT TREE.

39:59.397 --> 40:01.570
JUST SICK OF BARKING.

40:01.570 --> 40:04.533
WELL, SUIT YOURSELF.
(chuckles)

40:04.533 --> 40:06.174
(glass clatters)

40:08.577 --> 40:11.179
UH, YOU'RE OKAY WITH THIS,
RIGHT?

40:11.179 --> 40:14.543
I MEAN, IT'S NOT GONNA
AFFECT ANYTHING WITH US?

40:14.543 --> 40:17.516
I-I DON'T SEE WHY
IT WOULD.

40:17.516 --> 40:20.018
OKAY.

40:42.541 --> 40:45.013
HEY, ROBIN.
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?

40:45.013 --> 40:47.546
JUST OUT FOR A WALK.
IT'S SUCH A NICE DAY.

40:47.546 --> 40:50.218
YEAH, IT IS. SO HOW DO YOU
LIKE THE NEIGHBORHOOD?

40:50.218 --> 40:53.051
IS EVERYONE TREATIN' YOU OKAY?
 I GUESS SO.

40:53.051 --> 40:56.084
NO ONE'S GIVING YOU ANY GUFF
ABOUT ABOUT BEING A STRIPPER,

40:56.084 --> 40:58.226
ARE THEY?
 OH, NO.

40:58.226 --> 41:01.790
I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE, 'CAUSE
TRUST ME, I'VE BEEN THERE.

41:01.790 --> 41:05.764
WAY BACK WHEN, I WAS SORTA
IN THE SEX TRADE MYSELF.

41:05.764 --> 41:07.696
OH, YEAH.

41:07.696 --> 41:10.068
I USED TO MODEL
WOMEN'S FOUNDATION GARMENTS

41:10.068 --> 41:11.740
FOR SEARS, ROEBUCK.

41:11.740 --> 41:14.873
THESE BREASTS
PUT ME THROUGH COLLEGE.

41:14.873 --> 41:16.875
THEY'RE REAL, BY THE WAY.

41:16.875 --> 41:19.848
THEY LOOK REAL.

41:19.848 --> 41:21.680
YEAH.

41:21.680 --> 41:24.553
ANYWAY, I'M GLAD THAT PEOPLE
ARE TREATING YOU NICE.

41:24.553 --> 41:29.217
YOU KNOW WHAT
THE BEST PART IS?

41:29.217 --> 41:31.660
THEY ACTUALLY SEE ME.

41:31.660 --> 41:33.261
SEE YOU?

41:33.261 --> 41:35.263
I SPENT A LOT OF YEARS

41:35.263 --> 41:38.266
WORKING IN A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE
STARED AT ME ALL NIGHT LONG.

41:38.266 --> 41:40.869
BUT NO ONE EVER REALLY...
SAW ME.

41:40.869 --> 41:42.871
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

41:42.871 --> 41:44.933
I DO.

41:44.933 --> 41:46.935
AND WHEN I FIRST GOT HERE,

41:46.935 --> 41:50.609
I THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE
THE SAME THING. BUT...

41:50.609 --> 41:54.042
(sighs) I GET THE FEELING
YOUR NEIGHBORS

41:54.042 --> 41:58.747
SEE PAST ALL THE STUFF
THAT PEOPLE USUALLY LOOK AT.

41:58.747 --> 42:01.620
IT MAKES ME FEEL
REALLY GOOD.

42:01.620 --> 42:02.851
I'M GLAD.

42:04.723 --> 42:06.955
ROBIN GALLAGHER WAS RIGHT.

42:06.955 --> 42:09.928
THE PEOPLE SHE HAD MET
ON WISTERIA LANE

42:09.928 --> 42:12.731
HAD REALLY LOOKED AT HER,

42:12.731 --> 42:17.736
AND THEY HAD SEEN
HER SENSE OF MORALITY,

42:17.736 --> 42:21.570
HER LOYAL HEART...

42:21.570 --> 42:26.074
HER SURPRISING INSIGHT,

42:26.074 --> 42:30.779
HER FORGIVING NATURE.

42:30.779 --> 42:34.022
SOME PEOPLE
HAD EVEN TAKEN NOTICE

42:34.022 --> 42:36.554
OF HER INCREDIBLE BEAUTY...

42:39.788 --> 42:43.061
AND THEY WERE SURPRISED
TO DISCOVER

42:43.061 --> 42:46.765
THEY LIKED WHAT THEY SAW.
