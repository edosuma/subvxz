01:24.885 --> 01:26.554

01:26.587 --> 01:28.322
I WANTED TO CATCH UP
ON SOME SLEEP.

01:28.356 --> 01:30.224
- LET HER STAY.

01:30.258 --> 01:32.260
SURPRISE, I CANCELED LONDON.

01:32.293 --> 01:34.362
I AM COMING STRAIGHT HOME.

01:53.914 --> 01:57.117
- OH, YOU MISSED ME.

01:58.719 --> 01:59.687
- THERE YOU GO.

01:59.720 --> 02:02.156
A LITTLE LOWER, LET ME SEE.

02:02.190 --> 02:04.192
[chuckles]

02:04.225 --> 02:08.262
[doorbell rings]
- HMM, NICE TIMING.

02:08.296 --> 02:10.264
CLEANERS.

02:10.298 --> 02:13.301

02:16.204 --> 02:18.572

02:18.606 --> 02:20.208

02:20.241 --> 02:21.309

02:21.342 --> 02:22.543

02:22.576 --> 02:26.547
- NO, PLEASE, NO!

02:26.580 --> 02:27.881
- SHUT UP!

02:27.915 --> 02:29.417

CHRISTINE!

02:37.625 --> 02:38.959
- NO!

02:38.992 --> 02:42.162

SHE'S DEAD.

02:43.264 --> 02:44.732

02:44.765 --> 02:46.234
- ALLEGED?

02:46.267 --> 02:47.235
THE HUSBAND, BOYD HARTWELL,

02:47.268 --> 02:49.737

RAPE HIS WIFE.

02:49.770 --> 02:51.805

02:54.007 --> 02:56.477
- HE CALLED HIS MOTHER, TOLD HER
NOT TO CALL THE POLICE.

02:56.510 --> 02:58.746
SHE COULDN'T SLEEP,
CALLS AN HOUR AGO.

02:58.779 --> 03:01.349
UNIs GET HERE,
THERE'S NO CHRISTINE.

03:02.950 --> 03:05.653
- NO SIGN OF FORCED ENTRY.

03:05.686 --> 03:08.289
BOTH DOORS LOOK UNTOUCHED.
SOMEONE SHE KNEW?

03:08.322 --> 03:09.957
- WELL, MAYBE NOT.
VIDEO CAM'S OUT.

03:09.990 --> 03:11.292
SHE OPENS THE DOOR,

03:11.325 --> 03:13.494
HE PUSHES IN,
SIGN OF A STRUGGLE.

03:13.527 --> 03:14.862
- THEY HAVE A DAUGHTER.

03:14.895 --> 03:16.664
WHERE IS SHE?
- MADISON, FIVE.

03:16.697 --> 03:19.633
GRANDMOTHER SAID SHE STAYED
WITH HER LAST NIGHT.

03:19.667 --> 03:20.834
- OKAY.

03:20.868 --> 03:23.304
GET CSU IN HERE.

03:23.337 --> 03:25.506
AND TARU, SEE IF THEY
CAN RETRIEVE

03:25.539 --> 03:27.241
AN IMAGE OFF THIS LAPTOP.

03:27.275 --> 03:29.310
- WE GOT SOME BLOOD.

03:29.343 --> 03:31.812
- SO HE RAPES HER
HERE ON THE COUNTER

03:31.845 --> 03:33.381
IN FULL VIEW OF THE SCREEN.

03:33.414 --> 03:35.015
- YEAH, SHOWS THE HUSBAND
HE MEANS BUSINESS.

03:35.048 --> 03:37.751
IT'S DELIBERATE,
COULD BE PERSONAL.

03:37.785 --> 03:39.487
- AND HE FORCES HER
TO LEAVE WITH HIM?

03:39.520 --> 03:42.022
- THE NEIGHBORS DIDN'T SEE
OR HEAR A THING.

03:42.055 --> 03:45.593
- NO ONE COMING IN OR OUT OF
THIS HOUSE LAST NIGHT.

03:45.626 --> 03:47.761
- THIS DOOR'S OPEN.

03:47.795 --> 03:49.263
THEY LEFT OUT THE BACK.

03:49.297 --> 03:51.365
- HUSBAND SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT A RANSOM DEMAND?

03:51.399 --> 03:52.566
- NOTHING WE'VE HEARD.

03:52.600 --> 03:53.834
NO ONE'S BEEN ABLE
TO REACH HIM.

03:53.867 --> 03:56.970
HIS PLANE LANDS AT NOON.
- 16 HOURS.

03:57.004 --> 04:00.274
GOTTA BE THE LONGEST
FLIGHT OF HIS LIFE.

04:50.491 --> 04:51.759
- WHEN'S MOMMY COMING HOME?

04:51.792 --> 04:53.994
- SOON, SWEETHEART.
ISN'T THAT BELLA?

04:54.027 --> 04:57.931
GO--GO PLAY PRINCESS WITH HER.

04:57.965 --> 05:01.835
MY SON TOLD ME THE INTRUDER
SAID IF I CALLED THE POLICE,

05:01.869 --> 05:04.338
THEY'D KILL CHRISTINE.

05:04.372 --> 05:05.839
I HOPE I'VE DONE
THE RIGHT THING.

05:05.873 --> 05:07.441
- YOU DID, MA'AM.

05:07.475 --> 05:09.042
NOW WHEN'S THE LAST TIME YOU SAW
YOUR DAUGHTER-IN-LAW?

05:09.076 --> 05:11.011
- YESTERDAY.
YESTERDAY AFTERNOON.

05:11.044 --> 05:12.813
SHE DROPPED OFF MADISON.

05:12.846 --> 05:15.516
- DID SHE SEEM UPSET OR ANXIOUS?
- NO.

05:15.549 --> 05:19.487
CHRISTINE IS ALWAYS SO BRIGHT,
SO FULL OF LIFE.

05:19.520 --> 05:20.721
EVERYBODY ADORES HER.

05:20.754 --> 05:22.823
- NOW WHAT ABOUT BOYD?

05:22.856 --> 05:24.425
BEEN ANY PROBLEMS?

05:24.458 --> 05:25.826
- BOYD WORKS A LOT.

05:25.859 --> 05:28.429
BUT HIS FAMILY ALWAYS
COMES FIRST.

05:28.462 --> 05:34.034
AFTER TEN YEARS OF MARRIAGE,
THOSE TWO ARE STILL SO IN LOVE.

05:34.067 --> 05:35.202
- ALL WE KNOW FOR SURE IS THAT
CHRISTINE'S BEEN MISSING

05:35.235 --> 05:38.606
FOR 12 HOURS, AND OUR ONLY
WITNESS IS STILL IN THE AIR.

05:38.639 --> 05:40.007
- NO ACTIVITY
ON HER CREDIT CARDS,

05:40.040 --> 05:41.675
HER CELL'S OFF,
TARU'S CHECKING IT.

05:41.709 --> 05:43.777
- ALL RIGHT,
IF THIS IS A RAPE-ABDUCTION,

05:43.811 --> 05:46.146
ODDS ARE IT'S SOMEBODY
SHE'S CROSSED PATHS WITH.

05:46.179 --> 05:48.048
WHAT DO WE KNOW
ABOUT THIS COUPLE?

05:48.081 --> 05:50.518
- WELL, THEY'RE LIVING
THE UPPER EAST SIDE DREAM.

05:50.551 --> 05:53.921
I MEAN, BOYD AND HIS PARTNER
JUSTIN GELD,

05:53.954 --> 05:56.123
THEY LEFT MORGAN, STARTED UP
NEW MARKETS HEDGE FUND

05:56.156 --> 05:57.525
A COUPLE YEARS AGO.

05:57.558 --> 05:58.526
CHRISTINE'S
A STAY-AT-HOME MOM.

05:58.559 --> 05:59.527
SHE'S ON THE PARENT'S BOARD

05:59.560 --> 06:00.461
OF HER DAUGHTER'S PRESCHOOL.

06:00.494 --> 06:02.663
- THEY DO THE REGULAR
RICH PEOPLE MAMBO.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.998
WINTERS IN VAIL,
SUMMERS IN THE HAMPTONS.

06:05.032 --> 06:08.469
- HIS HEDGE FUND--THIS ECONOMY
CAN BE A HIGH-WIRE ACT.

06:08.502 --> 06:09.403
ANY ANGRY INVESTORS?

06:09.437 --> 06:11.171
- YEAH, THERE WERE
A COUPLE OF COMPLAINTS

06:11.204 --> 06:12.673
FILED AGAINST BOYD'S PARTNER.

06:12.706 --> 06:14.642
SO THE COMPANY
AND BOYD PAID SOME FINES,

06:14.675 --> 06:17.010
ADMITTED NO WRONGDOING--
THE COMPLAINTS WERE WITHDRAWN.

06:17.044 --> 06:18.812
- WELL, THAT'S GOTTA BE HARD
ON A PARTNERSHIP,

06:18.846 --> 06:20.013
AND THIS MIGHT BE TOO.

06:20.047 --> 06:21.649
NOW, ACCORDING TO
CHRISTINE'S CALENDAR,

06:21.682 --> 06:23.817
SHE HAD LUNCH
WITH GELD ON FRIDAY.

06:23.851 --> 06:27.821
A MONTH AGO, HER HUSBAND'S
IN BRAZIL--ANOTHER LUNCH.

06:27.855 --> 06:29.523
- OKAY, FIN, ROLLINS, FIND OUT

06:29.557 --> 06:31.525
WHAT'S UP WITH THE LADY
AND HER LUNCHES.

06:31.559 --> 06:34.061
YOU TWO, MEET THE HUSBAND'S
PLANE AT JFK.

06:34.094 --> 06:35.729
HE DIDN'T WANT NYPD CALLED.

06:35.763 --> 06:38.766
LET'S NOT GIVE HIM
A CHANCE TO GO ROGUE.

06:40.501 --> 06:42.169
- WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
I HEARD FROM CHRISTINE?

06:42.202 --> 06:43.804
MY WIFE SAW HER
AT THE PLANNING MEETING

06:43.837 --> 06:45.105
FOR THE PRESCHOOL BENEFIT.

06:45.138 --> 06:46.474
- WAS THAT BEFORE OR AFTER YOU

06:46.507 --> 06:50.010
AND CHRISTINE
HAD LUNCH ON FRIDAY?

06:50.043 --> 06:52.613
- I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE S.E.C.,
BUT IT AIN'T A GOOD IDEA

06:52.646 --> 06:55.516
TO LIE TO NYPD.

06:55.549 --> 06:57.217
- WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?

06:57.250 --> 06:59.520
- WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW CHRISTINE?

06:59.553 --> 07:03.223
- UH, WE HAD LUNCH, LE CIRQUE'S,
FRIDAY 2:00-4:00.

07:03.256 --> 07:06.059
- YEAH, THAT'S A LATE LUNCH.
YOU WALK HER HOME?

07:06.093 --> 07:07.528
- I GOT HER INTO A CAB.

07:07.561 --> 07:10.998
SHE'D HAD A FEW AND...
I WENT BACK TO WORK.

07:11.031 --> 07:13.033
- HMM.

07:13.066 --> 07:14.935
- LOOK, I DON'T KNOW WHAT
CHRISTINE TOLD YOU,

07:14.968 --> 07:17.137
BUT NOTHING INAPPROPRIATE
HAPPENED ON FRIDAY.

07:17.170 --> 07:17.971
- OKAY, WHAT ABOUT LAST NIGHT?

07:18.005 --> 07:19.640
YOU MIND TELLING US
WHERE YOU WERE?

07:19.673 --> 07:22.042
- I WAS AT THE WALDORF
WITH MY WIFE.

07:22.075 --> 07:24.177
WE DON'T LIKE RESTAURANTS
ON VALENTINE'S DAY.

07:24.211 --> 07:25.278
IT'S A SUCKER PLAY.

07:25.312 --> 07:28.882
SO WE HOLE UP FOR A FEW DAYS
AND ORDER ROOM SERVICE.

07:28.916 --> 07:30.117
- THAT'S SWEET.

07:30.150 --> 07:32.853
AND HOW ABOUT YOU AND BOYD?
HOW ARE YOU GUYS GETTING ALONG?

07:32.886 --> 07:34.154
- WE'RE BEST FRIENDS

07:34.187 --> 07:35.656
SINCE PREP SCHOOL,
LIKE BROTHERS.

07:35.689 --> 07:37.525
- SO HE DIDN'T MIND
BAILING YOU OUT

07:37.558 --> 07:39.192
WHEN YOU GOT JAMMED UP
BY THE S.E.C.?

07:39.226 --> 07:42.530
- NO, IT JUST GAVE HIM SOMETHING
ELSE TO RAG ON ME ABOUT.

07:42.563 --> 07:44.164
- WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU SPOKE WITH HIM?

07:44.197 --> 07:45.933
- LAST NIGHT.

07:45.966 --> 07:47.067
HE WAS AT THE AIRPORT.

07:47.100 --> 07:48.135
HE HAD TO JUMP BECAUSE CHRISTINE

07:48.168 --> 07:49.703
WANTED TO VIDEO CHAT.

07:49.737 --> 07:53.006
WHEN SHE SAYS JUMP...

07:53.040 --> 07:55.208
- I'LL GET 'EM THE MONEY,
I'LL-I'LL...

07:55.242 --> 07:58.211
I'LL DO WHATEVER THEY WANT.
JUST TELL ME YOU'RE OKAY.

07:58.245 --> 07:59.880
- BOYD HARTWELL.
- YEAH?

07:59.913 --> 08:01.081
- WE NEED YOU TO COME WITH US.

08:01.114 --> 08:02.082
- CHRISTINE, I GOTTA GO.

08:02.115 --> 08:03.551
- BOYD, BOYD!
WAIT. WE'RE HERE TO HELP YOU.

08:03.584 --> 08:05.753
- HONEY, LISTEN, JUST TELL THEM

08:05.786 --> 08:06.754
I'LL GET THE MONEY, OKAY?

08:06.787 --> 08:07.588
NO COPS, I HEAR YOU!

08:07.621 --> 08:08.922
ALL RIGHT, I LOVE YOU,
I GOTTA GO!

08:08.956 --> 08:10.591
- STOP!
- YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND!

08:10.624 --> 08:12.159
- TAKE IT EASY, PAL.
I DON'T WANNA CUFF YOU.

08:12.192 --> 08:13.661
- I DON'T NEED YOUR HELP.

08:13.694 --> 08:15.162
LISTEN, THAT WAS MY WIFE.

08:15.195 --> 08:16.697
THEY SAID NO COPS.

08:16.730 --> 08:19.132
THEY'RE GONNA KILL HER.

08:20.668 --> 08:23.604
SHE WAS FIGHTING BACK,
BUT...

08:23.637 --> 08:26.206
HE STARTED RAPING HER.

08:26.239 --> 08:27.307
HERE.

08:27.340 --> 08:30.077
I POINTED MY CELL AT THE SCREEN.

08:30.110 --> 08:31.845
- HE WORE A MASK.

08:31.879 --> 08:36.116
MAYBE HE THOUGHT YOUR WIFE
WOULD HAVE RECOGNIZED HIM.

08:36.149 --> 08:38.185
CAN YOU THINK OF ANYONE
WITH A REASON

08:38.218 --> 08:40.053
TO HURT YOU OR YOUR WIFE?

08:40.087 --> 08:42.623
- THIS CAN'T BE
SOMEONE WHO KNOWS US.

08:42.656 --> 08:45.926
- TELL US ABOUT
THE RANSOM DEMAND.

08:45.959 --> 08:50.230
- WHEN I LANDED, THERE WAS
A VOICEMAIL FROM CHRISTINE

08:50.263 --> 08:55.335
AND SHE SAID THAT
THEY WANTED $250,000.

08:55.368 --> 08:58.171
AND SHE MADE ME PROMISE NO COPS.

08:58.205 --> 08:59.607
OKAY? I CAN HANDLE THIS
ON MY OWN.

08:59.640 --> 09:01.241
- THAT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA,
MR. HARTWELL.

09:01.274 --> 09:02.075
- NO! PLEASE.

09:02.109 --> 09:05.278
IF THEY SEE YOU,
THEY WILL KILL HER!

09:07.681 --> 09:09.583
SORRY, I HAVEN'T
SLEPT IN 20 HOURS.

09:09.617 --> 09:10.918
MY HEAD IS EXPLODING.

09:10.951 --> 09:12.686
- WE UNDERSTAND THAT.

09:12.720 --> 09:16.724
BUT YOU HAVE TO LET US HANDLE
IT, MR. HARTWELL.

09:16.757 --> 09:21.662
IT'S THE BEST CHANCE YOU HAVE
OF GETTING YOUR WIFE BACK.

09:21.695 --> 09:22.763
- LEAVE IT IN MADISON'S
BACKPACK,

09:22.796 --> 09:24.698
UNDER THE BENCH
IN THE PARK.

09:24.732 --> 09:26.333
6:00 A.M., TOMORROW.

09:26.366 --> 09:30.270
BOYD, THE SAID NO COPS OR
THEY'LL KILL ME AND MADISON.

09:30.303 --> 09:33.741
THEY KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT US.

09:33.774 --> 09:34.775
- THEY'RE ON THE MOVE
FOR BOTH OF THE CALLS.

09:34.808 --> 09:38.045
BOUNCING OFF TOWERS
FROM 60TH TO 14TH STREET.

09:38.078 --> 09:39.212
YOU CAN HEAR TRAFFIC.

09:39.246 --> 09:40.881
- AND THEY TRACKED
HER LOCATION SINCE?

09:40.914 --> 09:43.016
- THE BATTERY WAS REMOVED AFTER
THE CALL TO THE HUSBAND.

09:43.050 --> 09:45.018
- ANY OTHER CALLS FROM HER CELL?

09:45.052 --> 09:47.821
- YEAH, TWO TO A NO-NAME PHONE.
WE'RE TRACKING THAT RIGHT NOW.

09:47.855 --> 09:51.258
- WELL, WHAT ABOUT
THE HUSBAND'S STORY?

09:51.291 --> 09:55.896
- HE SEEMS GENUINELY
TRAUMATIZED.

09:55.929 --> 09:57.297
- ALL RIGHT,
LET HIM GO HOME TO SLEEP

09:57.330 --> 10:00.367
AND TO SEE HIS DAUGHTER,
BUT I WANT A UNI ON HIM.

10:00.400 --> 10:01.769
- CAPTAIN, I DON'T THINK
HE'S IN ON THIS.

10:01.802 --> 10:03.637
- HE RAN FROM US ONCE,
HE'LL DO IT AGAIN.

10:03.671 --> 10:05.305
TARU HAVE THE TRAPS
ON HIS PHONES?

10:05.338 --> 10:07.374
- YEAH.
- NOW LET'S JUST HOPE SOMEBODY

10:07.407 --> 10:10.678
SHOWS UP AT THAT DROP
LOCATION TOMORROW.

10:14.848 --> 10:16.349
- OH, MAN.

10:16.383 --> 10:17.818
- WHAT?

10:17.851 --> 10:20.854
- VALENTINE'S DINNER;
I FORGOT.

10:23.691 --> 10:25.726
HEY.

10:25.759 --> 10:27.360
- DID YOU FORGET ABOUT DINNER?

10:27.394 --> 10:29.930
- NO, NO.

10:29.963 --> 10:31.899
UH, YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

10:31.932 --> 10:33.767
- THANKS.
- WE GOT JAMMED UP.

10:33.801 --> 10:35.202
- OH, I SEE,
I'M HOME FOR A WEEK,

10:35.235 --> 10:36.870
YOU'RE ALREADY
TAKING ME FOR GRANTED.

10:36.904 --> 10:37.871
- WHAT--
[chuckles]

10:37.905 --> 10:39.339
NEVER.

10:39.372 --> 10:43.376
JUST GIVE ME A MINUTE, HUH?

11:00.293 --> 11:05.298
- HEY, WATCH THAT DOG-WALKER
GOING INTO THE PARK.

11:28.355 --> 11:31.058
- FALSE ALARM.

11:38.899 --> 11:40.734
WHITE FEMALE
WEARING ALL BLACK,

11:40.768 --> 11:42.235
HEADING TOWARD THE BACKPACK.

11:43.436 --> 11:44.805
MOVE IN!

11:44.838 --> 11:46.273
- LET'S GO, LET'S GO.

11:52.545 --> 11:54.247
- POLICE! DROP IT!

11:54.281 --> 11:56.416
DROP IT!
- HELP!

11:56.449 --> 11:58.018
- HEY, TAKE IT EASY.
- NO!

11:58.051 --> 12:01.154
THEY'LL KILL ME, PLEASE!

12:01.188 --> 12:03.256
THEY'RE WATCHING!
- WHO IS?

12:03.290 --> 12:05.325
- THREE BLACK MEN!

12:05.358 --> 12:08.128
PLEASE LET ME GIVE THEM
THE MONEY! PLEASE!

12:08.161 --> 12:10.263
PLEASE!

12:10.297 --> 12:12.299
OH, GOD.
[sobbing]

12:20.307 --> 12:23.376
- THEY MADE ME
TAKE OFF MY CLOTHES...

12:23.410 --> 12:28.181
THEN THEY TOOK TURNS.

12:28.215 --> 12:32.285
SOMETIMES...TWO AT A TIME.

12:34.287 --> 12:37.324
SOMETIMES ALL THREE.

12:37.357 --> 12:40.093
MY MOUTH, EVERYWHERE.

12:40.127 --> 12:43.196
AND THEY MADE ME
DO THINGS TO THEM.

12:43.230 --> 12:48.235
- WELL, CHRISTINE,
YOU SAID THAT THEY WERE BLACK.

12:48.268 --> 12:50.070
CAN YOU GIVE ME
ANY MORE DETAILS?

12:50.103 --> 12:52.339
- OH, DO I HAVE TO?

12:52.372 --> 12:54.441
THEY KNOW WHERE I LIVE.

12:54.474 --> 12:56.376
- WELL...

12:56.409 --> 13:00.047
HAD YOU SEEN ANY OF THEM BEFORE?

13:00.080 --> 13:02.115
- I DON'T THINK SO.

13:02.149 --> 13:04.017
- SHE TOLD ME AT THE HOSPITAL

13:04.051 --> 13:06.386
WHAT THEY DID TO HER.

13:06.419 --> 13:09.156
I WANT TO KILL THEM!

13:09.189 --> 13:11.959
- I GET THAT.

13:11.992 --> 13:14.061
LOOK, I NEED TO ASK...

13:14.094 --> 13:17.564
ANYONE IN YOUR LIFE
WHO MATCHES THE DESCRIPTION?

13:17.597 --> 13:20.200
- YOU MEAN DO I KNOW
ANY BLACK GUYS?

13:23.236 --> 13:25.605
NOT MANY.
A FEW AT THE GYM.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.474
MY ORTHOPEDIST.

13:27.507 --> 13:30.343
- TWO OF THEM
HAD SHAVED HEADS.

13:30.377 --> 13:33.847
ONE HAD DREADS.
STOCKY.

13:33.881 --> 13:37.284
- DO YOU REMEMBER WHICH ONE
ASSAULTED YOU HERE IN YOUR HOME?

13:37.317 --> 13:39.386
- NO, HE HAD A MASK.

13:39.419 --> 13:43.456
- OKAY,
WE FOUND A ROBE DOWNSTAIRS

13:43.490 --> 13:45.525
ON THE FLOOR IN THE KITCHEN.

13:45.558 --> 13:48.161
THEY LET YOU GET DRESSED?

13:48.195 --> 13:50.330
- LET ME?

13:50.363 --> 13:53.333
HE HAD A GUN ON ME,
AND HE WATCHED ME.

13:53.366 --> 13:55.468
HE TOLD ME WHAT TO WEAR.

13:57.370 --> 13:59.172
- SO WHAT HAPPENED NEXT?

14:01.041 --> 14:03.476
- HE FORCED ME
OUT THE BACK DOOR.

14:03.510 --> 14:07.347
AROUND THE SIDE...
THERE WAS A VAN.

14:07.380 --> 14:09.082
HE PUSHED ME IN.

14:09.116 --> 14:11.518
- DID YOU STAY IN THE VAN
THE WHOLE TIME?

14:11.551 --> 14:13.620
- THEY PARKED SOMETIMES,
BUT I DON'T KNOW WHERE.

14:13.653 --> 14:16.623
IF IT WAS DAY OR NIGHT.

14:16.656 --> 14:19.993
- OKAY.
DID THEY SAY ANYTHING TO YOU?

14:20.027 --> 14:22.295
DID THEY KNOW YOUR NAME?

14:22.329 --> 14:25.432
YOUR HUSBAND'S NAME?

14:25.465 --> 14:29.336
- THEY SAID I WAS A RICH BITCH.

14:29.369 --> 14:33.573
THEY SAID I DESERVED IT.

14:33.606 --> 14:36.977
- TELL ME ABOUT JUSTIN GELD.

14:39.079 --> 14:42.382
- HE'S MY PARTNER AND MY FRIEND.
- CHRISTINE'S FRIEND TOO?

14:42.415 --> 14:44.617
- YES.

14:44.651 --> 14:46.453
- DID YOU KNOW
THEY HAVE LUNCH TOGETHER

14:46.486 --> 14:48.621
WHEN YOU'RE OUT OF TOWN?

14:48.655 --> 14:51.324
- I--I'M SURE CHRISTINE TOLD ME.

14:51.358 --> 14:54.962
- LOOK, BOYD, SOMETIMES
AN ATTACK LIKE THIS

14:54.995 --> 14:56.596
IS FOR REVENGE.

14:56.629 --> 15:00.433
AN ANGRY HUSBAND, SOMEBODY WHO
FELT BURNED IN A BUSINESS DEAL.

15:00.467 --> 15:04.137
- YOU THINK I BROUGHT
THIS ON MYSELF?

15:04.171 --> 15:06.373
I MEAN, I'VE DONE THINGS
I'M NOT PROUD OF.

15:06.406 --> 15:10.377
- IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WANNA
TELL ME ABOUT?

15:10.410 --> 15:12.545
- THIS WHOLE THING.

15:15.415 --> 15:18.418
I GOTTA SAY, I'M ROCKED.

15:21.989 --> 15:24.992
- YOUR WIFE IS ASKING FOR YOU.

15:30.363 --> 15:35.102
MOST RAPE VICTIMS SHUT DOWN,
BUT...NOT CHRISTINE.

15:35.135 --> 15:36.503
- YEAH, WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

15:36.536 --> 15:38.571
- LOOK, THREE BLACK MEN
IN A VAN?

15:38.605 --> 15:41.741
MAYBE.
OR...

15:41.774 --> 15:47.047
MAYBE SHE DOESN'T WANT US
TO KNOW WHO DID THIS TO HER.

15:47.080 --> 15:50.250
- HEY, SO THAT NO-NAME CELL
CHRISTINE CALLED?

15:50.283 --> 15:51.551
I RAN DOWN THE OTHER INCOMINGS.

15:51.584 --> 15:53.220
THERE'S A LOT OF
WALL STREET GUYS

15:53.253 --> 15:55.288
ORDERING DELIVERIES
FROM A HEALTH FOOD STORE.

15:55.322 --> 15:57.190
- YEAH?
LET'S FIND OUT WHAT KIND OF

15:57.224 --> 16:00.227
PROTEIN POWDER
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT.

16:01.728 --> 16:04.031
- YEAH, YOU'VE GOT DAREL.
WHO IS THIS?

16:04.064 --> 16:05.698
- NYPD, DAREL.

16:05.732 --> 16:08.068
PUT DOWN THE PHONE.

16:08.101 --> 16:10.270
- YES, OFFICERS.
HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

16:10.303 --> 16:14.274
- TELL US HOW YOU KNOW
CHRISTINE HARTWELL.

16:14.307 --> 16:16.243
- HE'S RUNNING!
- POLICE!

16:16.276 --> 16:18.045
- STOP!

16:21.648 --> 16:24.717
WHY'D YOU RUN, DAREL?

16:24.751 --> 16:26.319
- I DON'T KNOW ANY CHRISTINE.

16:26.353 --> 16:29.489
- THOUGHT WHEATGRASS
MADE YOU SMARTER.

16:29.522 --> 16:31.058
- MONDAY NIGHT
I WAS AT A RANGERS GAME

16:31.091 --> 16:32.325
WITH MY GIRLFRIEND.

16:32.359 --> 16:33.626
YOU CAN ASK THE PEOPLE
IN MY SECTION.

16:33.660 --> 16:35.362
THE DREADS STAND OUT
AT A HOCKEY GAME.

16:35.395 --> 16:37.797
- OKAY, BUT WHY DID CHRISTINE
CALL YOU, DAREL?

16:37.830 --> 16:40.200
- MAYBE I SHOULD
TAKE THE FIFTH ON THAT.

16:40.233 --> 16:43.470
- LOOK, MAN, YOU'RE ON THE HOOK
FOR RAPE AND KIDNAPPING.

16:43.503 --> 16:45.638
YOU NEED TO TRY
TO HELP YOURSELF OUT.

16:45.672 --> 16:49.442
NOW, IF YOU'RE JUST HER DEALER,
WE DON'T EVEN CARE ABOUT THAT.

16:49.476 --> 16:52.512
- FOR REAL?
- YEAH.

16:52.545 --> 16:55.648
- ALL RIGHT, MAN.

16:55.682 --> 16:57.217
SHE WANTED PARTY FAVORS.

16:57.250 --> 16:58.651
HER USUAL.

16:58.685 --> 17:02.089
UH, AN EIGHTBALL, SOME "X".

17:02.122 --> 17:04.757
THESE WHITE HOUSEWIVES,
THEY CRACKED OUT.

17:04.791 --> 17:07.494
SHE'S CUT OFF.
- OKAY, DON'T PUSH IT.

17:07.527 --> 17:10.663
WHAT HAPPENED AFTER
CHRISTINE CALLED YOU?

17:10.697 --> 17:13.433
- SHE SENT HER DELIVERY GUY
TO MY STORE.

17:13.466 --> 17:16.403
HE'S A WHITE DUDE.

17:16.436 --> 17:20.207
WORK BOOTS, UH, SHORT PANTS.

17:20.240 --> 17:23.110
HEY, IT'S WINTER, MAN.
WHAT'S UP WITH THAT?

17:23.143 --> 17:25.245
- I DON'T KNOW WHO THAT IS.

17:25.278 --> 17:28.481
- WELL, HE SAYS
HE'S YOUR DRUG DEALER.

17:28.515 --> 17:31.518
YOU'VE CALLED HIS NUMBER BEFORE.

17:33.586 --> 17:36.589
THERE WAS COCAINE
AND ECSTASY IN YOUR SYSTEM.

17:39.226 --> 17:41.528
- YOU KNOW WE HAVE
THE RAPE KIT RESULTS.

17:41.561 --> 17:45.165
THERE'S EVIDENCE YOU DID SUFFER
A SEXUAL ASSAULT,

17:45.198 --> 17:50.770
BUT THE DNA SHOWS YOUR RAPIST
WAS A LONE WHITE MALE.

17:50.803 --> 17:53.373
- SO CHRISTINE,
I NEED YOU TO THINK

17:53.406 --> 17:58.411
VERY CAREFULLY ABOUT WHAT
YOU'RE GONNA SAY NEXT, OKAY?

18:05.418 --> 18:07.420
- OKAY.

18:09.389 --> 18:10.757
HE MADE ME CALL.

18:10.790 --> 18:15.795
HE SAID HE WANTED ME,
YOU KNOW, AMPED UP.

18:18.731 --> 18:20.467
HE HIT ME WITH THE GUN.

18:20.500 --> 18:23.470
- WHO IS HE?

18:23.503 --> 18:26.373
- HE'S BEEN STALKING ME.

18:26.406 --> 18:28.508
AND HE SAID HE HAD FRIENDS
THAT WOULD HURT ME.

18:28.541 --> 18:31.578
- CHRISTINE, WE'RE NOT GONNA
LET ANYONE HURT YOU.

18:31.611 --> 18:34.614
BUT YOU HAVE TO TELL US
WHO HE IS.

18:38.518 --> 18:40.753
- KEVIN FAHEY.

18:40.787 --> 18:42.322
POLICE.

18:42.355 --> 18:43.690
- I'LL MOVE THE TRUCK.
I'M SORRY.

18:43.723 --> 18:45.425
- NO, YOU WON'T.

18:45.458 --> 18:46.726
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

18:46.759 --> 18:48.328
- ARREST FOR WHAT?

18:48.361 --> 18:51.364
- RAPE AND KIDNAPPING.

18:57.604 --> 18:58.605
- I RAPED HER?!

18:58.638 --> 19:00.173
THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED.

19:00.207 --> 19:01.441
- WE MATCHED YOUR DNA
TO THE CRIME SCENE.

19:01.474 --> 19:03.576
- CHRISTINE TOLD ME
TO PRETEND TO RAPE HER.

19:03.610 --> 19:05.645
- OKAY, AND ROUGHING HER UP?
WAS THAT PART OF THE PLAN TOO?

19:05.678 --> 19:06.446
KEVIN, HEY.

19:06.479 --> 19:08.481
KEVIN, WE KNOW
ABOUT YOUR RECORD.

19:08.515 --> 19:09.749
- SHE WANTED IT.

19:09.782 --> 19:13.386
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, I THINK
SHE GOT OFF ON IT A LITTLE BIT.

19:13.420 --> 19:15.455
WE'RE IN A RELATIONSHIP.

19:15.488 --> 19:16.823
IT'S BEEN GOING
ON FOR SIX MONTHS.

19:16.856 --> 19:19.459
- WHAT, SHE JUST LIKES
GUYS IN GREEN SHORTS?

19:19.492 --> 19:20.593
- YEAH.

19:20.627 --> 19:23.430
FIRST TIME I MADE A DELIVERY,
SHE ANSWERED THE DOOR

19:23.463 --> 19:26.399
IN HER YOGA OUTFIT,
THOSE TIGHT PANTS.

19:26.433 --> 19:28.268
- GO ON.

19:28.301 --> 19:29.602
- WE HIT IT OFF RIGHT AWAY.

19:29.636 --> 19:31.471
SHE ASKED ME IF I WANTED
A VITAMIN WATER.

19:31.504 --> 19:32.472
I CAME IN.

19:32.505 --> 19:34.741
SHE STARTED KISSING ME.

19:34.774 --> 19:36.676
AND SHE PULLED OFF
THE BLACK PANTS,

19:36.709 --> 19:37.677
BENT OVER THE STAIRS...

19:37.710 --> 19:39.412
IT WAS SO...INVITING--

19:39.446 --> 19:42.549
- EASY.
YOU'RE HERE ON A RAPE CHARGE.

19:42.582 --> 19:43.950
- THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING
TO TELL YOU GUYS.

19:43.983 --> 19:45.017
IT WAS LIKE OUR GAME,
YOU KNOW?

19:45.051 --> 19:49.389
SHE WOULD ANSWER THE DOOR
IN A TOWEL OR LINGERIE.

19:49.422 --> 19:52.659
- OKAY, GOT IT, SO YOU'RE LIVING
THE PENTHOUSE DREAM. GOT IT.

19:52.692 --> 19:54.627
WHY INVOLVE HER HUSBAND?

19:54.661 --> 19:56.929
- OKAY, THAT PART
WAS A BAD IDEA.

19:56.963 --> 19:59.232
- YOU THINK?
- WE WERE SUPPOSED TO GO AWAY

19:59.266 --> 20:00.533
FOR VALENTINE'S DAY,

20:00.567 --> 20:01.601
BUT HER HUSBAND
WAS COMING HOME EARLY.

20:01.634 --> 20:02.735
- SHE TELL YOU THAT?

20:02.769 --> 20:04.237
- SHE WAS PRETTY UPSET.

20:04.271 --> 20:06.506
THEN SHE TOLD ME
SHE HAD A PLAN.

20:06.539 --> 20:08.007
I'D PRETEND TO RAPE HER,

20:08.040 --> 20:10.009
THEN I WOULD PRETEND
TO KIDNAP HER.

20:10.042 --> 20:12.279
BUT IT WAS JUST
ABOUT US BEING TOGETHER.

20:12.312 --> 20:13.780
SHE BROUGHT UP THE MONEY.

20:13.813 --> 20:14.881
- YOU GOT ANY PROOF?

20:14.914 --> 20:18.418
LIKE VOICE MESSAGES,
TEXTS, NOTES?

20:18.451 --> 20:20.553
- WE ONLY TALKED WHEN
I MADE DELIVERIES.

20:20.587 --> 20:22.422
- OF COURSE.

20:22.455 --> 20:23.423
- I'M TELLING YOU THE TRUTH.

20:23.456 --> 20:24.624
SHE SET THE WHOLE THING UP.

20:24.657 --> 20:26.859
WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
OUR SCREW-CATION.

20:26.893 --> 20:28.695
SHE EVEN HAD A PLACE
ALL SET UP.

20:28.728 --> 20:32.432
THIS REALLY COOL LOFT IN SOHO.

20:32.465 --> 20:35.368
- WHY ARE YOU ACCUSING ME?

20:35.402 --> 20:36.603
I WAS RAPED.

20:36.636 --> 20:38.004
- I'M NOT ACCUSING YOU,
CHRISTINE.

20:38.037 --> 20:41.374
THERE ARE JUST
SOME...INCONSISTENCIES

20:41.408 --> 20:42.609
IN YOUR STORY.

20:42.642 --> 20:44.444
- I TOLD YOU--
I MEAN, HE HELD A GUN ON ME.

20:44.477 --> 20:45.878
- OKAY.

20:45.912 --> 20:47.647
SO WHEN IS THE FIRST TIME
YOU MET KEVIN?

20:47.680 --> 20:51.351
- I'M NOT SURE.
A FEW MONTHS AGO?

20:51.384 --> 20:53.586
WHO REMEMBERS DELIVERY MEN?
I DON'T.

20:53.620 --> 20:55.522
- SO YOU NEVER HAD
SEX WITH HIM BEFORE?

20:55.555 --> 20:56.856
- WHAT?!

20:56.889 --> 20:58.558
NO.

20:58.591 --> 21:00.393
SICK.

21:00.427 --> 21:02.662
- SIT DOWN, CHRISTINE.

21:05.765 --> 21:08.067
SEE, THE LOFT--
NOW, KEVIN TOLD US

21:08.100 --> 21:09.602
THAT YOU TOLD HIM
WHERE TO TAKE YOU.

21:09.636 --> 21:11.371
- THAT'S A LIE.

21:11.404 --> 21:13.506
I HAVE NEVER SEEN THAT PLACE
BEFORE IN MY LIFE.

21:13.540 --> 21:19.045
- OKAY, SO WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED AT THE LOFT?

21:19.078 --> 21:20.847
- I ALREADY WENT OVER THIS.

21:20.880 --> 21:22.982
- TELL ME AGAIN.

21:24.584 --> 21:26.586
- WE HAD SEX.

21:26.619 --> 21:30.357
EVERYWHERE. IN THE BED,
ON THE FLOOR.

21:30.390 --> 21:34.627
SOMETIMES HE'S GENTLE, SOMETIMES
HE SLAPS ME, CALLS ME A BITCH.

21:34.661 --> 21:37.063
MAKES ME GET ON ALL FOURS.

21:37.096 --> 21:38.598
IT WAS HORRIBLE.

21:38.631 --> 21:41.634
- AND WHAT WAS GOING
THROUGH YOUR HEAD?

21:43.636 --> 21:44.737
- I SHUT DOWN.

21:44.771 --> 21:47.940
I--I DID WHAT HE TOLD ME TO DO.

21:47.974 --> 21:51.378
IF HE WANTED DRUGS,
I GOT DRUGS.

21:51.411 --> 21:56.015
IF HE WANTED SEX,
I GAVE IT TO HIM.

21:56.048 --> 21:59.652
IF HE WANTED ME TO SUCK
ON HIS GUN, I DID THAT TOO.

21:59.686 --> 22:02.655
ON MY KNEES,
BEGGING FOR MY LIFE.

22:04.957 --> 22:07.627
DON'T YOU GET IT?

22:09.662 --> 22:11.398
- OKAY, CHRISTINE.

22:12.632 --> 22:15.535
I UNDERSTAND.

22:15.568 --> 22:18.905
- THAT'S WHERE HE, UH...
THAT'S WHERE THIS HAPPENED?

22:18.938 --> 22:23.810
SICK BASTARD.
DELIVERY GUY IN MY HOUSE?

22:23.843 --> 22:25.678
- HONEY, PLEASE,
I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE.

22:25.712 --> 22:26.746
- OKAY.

22:26.779 --> 22:29.549
I'M TAKING MY WIFE HOME.

22:29.582 --> 22:31.584
- WE'LL BE IN TOUCH,
CHRISTINE.

22:31.618 --> 22:34.987
- GIVE ME SOMETHING.
- SHE SAID SHE WAS TIRED.

22:35.021 --> 22:36.456
I DIDN'T WANT HER TO LAWYER UP.
- ABSOLUTELY.

22:36.489 --> 22:38.925
THERE'S STILL A CHANCE
SHE COULD BE A VICTIM.

22:38.958 --> 22:41.861
- WELL, FROM WHAT I JUST HEARD,
SHE'S LYING.

22:41.894 --> 22:44.531
SHE'S USING PRESENT TENSE,
SHE'S MIXING TENSES.

22:44.564 --> 22:46.466
- IT'S LIKE SHE'S MAKING IT UP
AS SHE GOES ALONG.

22:46.499 --> 22:48.635
SHE'S TRYING TO CONVINCE US.

22:48.668 --> 22:50.470
- SHE SAID, "WE HAD SEX."

22:50.503 --> 22:52.672
WHEN SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT
WHAT THE RAPIST DID TO HER.

22:52.705 --> 22:55.642
NO REAL VICTIM
DESCRIBES RAPE LIKE THAT.

22:55.675 --> 22:57.544
- WHAT ABOUT THE HUSBAND?

22:57.577 --> 22:59.846
- HE THINKS THERE'S NOTHING
WRONG WITH THE MARRIAGE

22:59.879 --> 23:01.914
THAT A BLUE BOX
AND THIGH-HIGHS CAN'T FIX.

23:01.948 --> 23:03.483
- EASIER THAN COUPLES
COUNSELING.

23:03.516 --> 23:05.652
[cell phone chimes]
- LOOK, I KNOW HE HAS A RECORD,

23:05.685 --> 23:08.555
BUT IS THERE ANY CHANCE
KEVIN IS JUST HER PATSY?

23:08.588 --> 23:10.923
- OH, YEAH, I CAN SEE HER
PLAYING HIM.

23:10.957 --> 23:14.561
YOU KNOW,
THIS IS INTERESTING.

23:14.594 --> 23:17.564
THE OWNER OF THE LOFT,
THE MANGO LLC,

23:17.597 --> 23:21.468
IT'S A FRONT
OWNED BY JUSTIN GELD.

23:21.501 --> 23:23.035
- THAT'S BOYD'S
BUSINESS PARTNER.

23:23.069 --> 23:27.039
- OKAY, YOU TWO GO TALK TO GELD.

23:27.073 --> 23:28.575
- THIS ISN'T ME.

23:28.608 --> 23:31.644
I'VE BEEN IN
A HOTEL WITH MY WIFE.

23:31.678 --> 23:33.480
NOW IF THI--THIS IS ABOUT...

23:33.513 --> 23:38.518
CHRISTINE BEING KIDNAPPED,
THEN YOU'RE WAY OFF THE MARK.

23:38.551 --> 23:40.920
I MEAN, YEAH, WHAT,
BOYD AND I TALK.

23:40.953 --> 23:42.655
WE'RE PARTNERS.

23:42.689 --> 23:44.891
- DID BOYD TELL YOU THE RANSOM
CHRISTINE'S KIDNAPPERS ASKED FOR

23:44.924 --> 23:47.827
IS THE SAME AMOUNT THAT YOU
OWE HIM FOR THE S.E.C. FINES?

23:47.860 --> 23:49.529
- NO.

23:49.562 --> 23:50.530
- YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW THIS GUY FOUND OUT

23:50.563 --> 23:51.864
ABOUT YOUR LITTLE HIDEAWAY?

23:51.898 --> 23:53.766
YOU GIVE HIM THE PASS CODE?

23:53.800 --> 23:55.502
- I'VE NEVER SEEN
HIM IN MY LIFE.

23:55.535 --> 23:57.537
- WELL, 'CAUSE YOUR
PARTNER'S WIFE

23:57.570 --> 24:00.540
WAS RAPED HERE IN YOUR...F-PAD.

24:00.573 --> 24:02.875
AND THE AMOUNT OF
THE RANSOM DEMAND?

24:02.909 --> 24:05.211
SURE DOES SEEM LIKE YOU COULD BE
THE ONE THAT SET THIS UP.

24:05.244 --> 24:07.614
SO IF YOU HAVE ANY
OTHER IDEAS ABOUT HOW

24:07.647 --> 24:11.718
MAYBE SHE ENDED UP HERE...
NOW'S THE TIME.

24:11.751 --> 24:14.954
- OKAY, OFF THE RECORD...

24:14.987 --> 24:17.156
CHRISTINE'S BEEN HERE BEFORE.

24:17.189 --> 24:20.560
A FEW TIMES.

24:20.593 --> 24:21.761
SHE KNOWS THE CODE.

24:21.794 --> 24:23.663
- CAN YOU PROVE THAT?

24:23.696 --> 24:25.665
- NO, THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT OF
AN F-PAD--IT'S DISCREET,

24:25.698 --> 24:26.766
THERE'S NO DOORMAN,
IT'S ALL CASH.

24:26.799 --> 24:31.037
- WHEN YOU AND CHRISTINE
WENT OUT TO LUNCH ON FRIDAY,

24:31.070 --> 24:33.640
DID SHE ASK YOU WHAT YOU WERE
DOING FOR VALENTINE'S?

24:33.673 --> 24:36.275
- YEAH, SHE KNEW THE LOFT
WOULD BE EMPTY.

24:36.308 --> 24:37.376
- DID YOU TWO TALK ABOUT BOYD?

24:37.409 --> 24:40.146
- YEAH, I TOLD HER THAT BOYD
WAS COMING HOME EARLY,

24:40.179 --> 24:43.616
BUT THAT SHE SHOULD, YOU KNOW,
ACT SURPRISED WHEN HE TOLD HER.

24:43.650 --> 24:44.717
- GOOD STORY.

24:44.751 --> 24:46.285
TOO BAD YOU CAN'T
PROVE ANY OF IT.

24:46.318 --> 24:48.988
- MAYBE I CAN.

24:49.021 --> 24:53.025
I HAVE A MOTION-ACTIVATED CAMERA
OVER THE BED.

24:54.627 --> 24:57.029
- CHRISTINE
KNOW ABOUT THAT CAMERA?

24:57.063 --> 24:58.297
- NO.

24:58.330 --> 25:00.633
I TURNED IT OFF
WHEN SHE WAS HERE.

25:00.667 --> 25:02.535
I MEAN, THAT KIND OF THING--

25:02.569 --> 25:04.671
- YOU MEAN BANGING
YOUR PARTNER'S WIFE?

25:04.704 --> 25:08.575
- YEAH, IT COULD COME BACK
AND BITE YOU IN THE ASS.

25:08.608 --> 25:11.611
- YEAH, OH, BABY.

25:13.813 --> 25:16.649
OH, JUST LAY BACK DOWN.

25:16.683 --> 25:20.787
'CAUSE CHRISTINE'S GONNA TAKE
REALLY GOOD CARE OF YOU.

25:20.820 --> 25:22.789
[laughs]

25:22.822 --> 25:25.958
[breathing hard]

25:25.992 --> 25:28.861
I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU LIKE.

25:28.895 --> 25:32.298
- I'M GONNA GO OUT ON A LIMB
HERE AND SAY A JURY

25:32.331 --> 25:36.235
IS GONNA HAVE A HARD TIME
SEEING THIS AS COERCED.

25:43.910 --> 25:45.344
- YOU'RE A BAD GIRL,
YOU KNOW THAT?

25:45.377 --> 25:47.046
- [giggles]

25:47.079 --> 25:48.815
- DOES YOUR HUSBAND
KNOW HOW BAD YOU ARE?

25:48.848 --> 25:50.750
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT HIM.

25:50.783 --> 25:55.688
YOU HAVE ANOTHER PACKAGE FOR ME?
[both laugh]

25:55.722 --> 25:59.859
- HE MUST HAVE MADE HER DO
AND SAY THOSE THINGS.

25:59.892 --> 26:01.160
HE SAID HE WAS GONNA KILL HER.

26:01.193 --> 26:03.195
I LOVE MY WIFE.
- I UNDERSTAND.

26:03.229 --> 26:05.097
- I KNOW WHAT I SAW, DETECTIVE.

26:05.131 --> 26:08.735
I SAW HIM BRUTALIZE HER
IN OUR OWN HOME.

26:08.768 --> 26:11.170
- I CAN IMAGINE
HOW TRAUMATIC THAT WAS,

26:11.203 --> 26:12.872
BUT LOOK, I GOTTA BE STRAIGHT
WITH YOU.

26:12.905 --> 26:16.643
BOYD, WE BELIEVE
SHE'S COMPLICIT IN THIS.

26:16.676 --> 26:18.778
- I SAW THE BRUISES.

26:18.811 --> 26:23.082
I HELD HER LAST NIGHT WHILE SHE
WAS HAVING NIGHT TERRORS.

26:23.115 --> 26:25.284
WHATEVER THAT BASTARD
MADE HER DO,

26:25.317 --> 26:27.119
SHE DID BECAUSE SHE HAD TO.

26:27.153 --> 26:29.188
- HE MADE ME DO THOSE THINGS.
I TOLD YOU.

26:29.221 --> 26:31.190
- YOU TOLD ME A LOT OF THINGS,
CHRISTINE,

26:31.223 --> 26:33.693
BUT I'VE BEEN
DOING THIS FOR A WHILE,

26:33.726 --> 26:37.630
SO WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME
WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED?

26:37.664 --> 26:39.799
- HE MADE ME ACT
LIKE I LIKED IT.

26:39.832 --> 26:41.801
I DIDN'T KNOW
WE WERE BEING TAPED.

26:41.834 --> 26:43.069
- WELL THAT SEEMED PRETTY CLEAR.

26:43.102 --> 26:45.104
- I WAS TERRORIZED FOR TWO DAYS
BY THIS--

26:45.137 --> 26:47.006
- JUST STOP.
- NO, YOU STOP.

26:47.039 --> 26:49.208
STOP BROWBEATING MY CLIENT.

26:49.241 --> 26:51.077
- OKAY, COUNSELOR.

26:51.110 --> 26:54.113
YOU'RE GONNA EARN YOUR PAYCHECK
ON THIS ONE.

26:58.885 --> 26:59.852
- MARVIN EXLEY.

26:59.886 --> 27:01.020
YOUR HUSBAND RETAINED ME

27:01.053 --> 27:03.723
TO REPRESENT YOU,
SO TALK TO ME.

27:03.756 --> 27:06.125
- AS IF THIS CASE WASN'T
BAD ENOUGH BEFORE.

27:06.158 --> 27:07.860
HER HUSBAND
BRINGS IN MARVIN EXLEY?

27:07.894 --> 27:10.930
- WELL, HE CAN AFFORD EXLEY,
AND SHE'S PATHOLOGICAL.

27:10.963 --> 27:12.231
- WE CAN'T LET HER
GET AWAY WITH IT.

27:12.264 --> 27:15.802
EVERY TIME A WOMAN
MAKES A FALSE ACCUSATION,

27:15.835 --> 27:17.770
IT MAKES IT THAT MUCH HARDER
FOR REAL VICTIMS.

27:17.804 --> 27:20.707
- WE COULD CUT A DEAL
WITH KEVIN.

27:20.740 --> 27:22.008
PLAY HIM DOWN TO
SECOND-DEGREE COERCION.

27:22.041 --> 27:24.176
- HE'D BE MORE THAN
HAPPY TO TESTIFY.

27:24.210 --> 27:27.379
- OKAY, WE'LL CHARGE HER WITH
COERCION, OBSTRUCTION,

27:27.413 --> 27:29.682
AND FILING A FALSE REPORT.

27:29.716 --> 27:32.719
THING THAT SCARES ME
IN CASES LIKE THIS--

27:32.752 --> 27:35.755
THERE'S ALWAYS ANOTHER SHOE.

27:37.857 --> 27:39.792
- SERIOUSLY, THEY'VE BEEN
MARRIED TEN YEARS

27:39.826 --> 27:41.694
AND THE HUSBAND HAS NO IDEA?

27:41.728 --> 27:45.865
- WELL, I THINK HE WANTS
TO BELIEVE HER.

27:45.898 --> 27:49.802
- HE DOESN'T WANNA KNOW.

27:49.836 --> 27:52.204
- HOW YOU DOING, HMM?

27:52.238 --> 27:56.242
YOU'VE BEEN A LITTLE QUIET
SINCE YOU GOT HOME.

27:56.275 --> 28:00.046
- IT'S TWO DIFFERENT WORLDS,
YOU KNOW?

28:00.079 --> 28:03.149
MY BODY'S HERE, I JUST DON'T
KNOW IF I AM YET.

28:03.182 --> 28:04.483
- YEAH.

28:04.516 --> 28:06.218
THAT COULD TAKE SOME TIME.

28:06.252 --> 28:10.256
JUST SO YOU KNOW...
I'M HERE.

28:13.292 --> 28:15.027
- YOU'RE A BAD GIRL,
YOU KNOW THAT?

28:15.061 --> 28:16.495
- [giggling]

28:16.528 --> 28:18.765
- DOES YOUR HUSBAND KNOW
HOW BAD YOU ARE?

28:18.798 --> 28:20.867
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT HIM.

28:20.900 --> 28:22.735
YOU HAVE ANOTHER PACKAGE
FOR ME?

28:22.769 --> 28:26.839
- YES.
- LET ME SEE THAT PACKAGE.

28:28.207 --> 28:30.810
- MR. FAHEY, CAN YOU TELL US
WHAT YOU AND THE DEFENDANT

28:30.843 --> 28:32.979
WERE DOING ON THAT TAPE?

28:33.012 --> 28:35.247
- WELL, WE WERE HAVING SEX.
- CONSENSUAL SEX?

28:35.281 --> 28:36.382
- OH, YEAH.

28:36.415 --> 28:38.317
- AND WAS THAT THE FIRST TIME
THAT YOU AND CHRISTINE

28:38.350 --> 28:41.253
HAD CONSENSUAL SEX?
- NO, NO, IT WAS NOT.

28:41.287 --> 28:42.454
UM, WE BEGAN A RELATIONSHIP
SIX MONTHS AGO,

28:42.488 --> 28:46.525
AND WE HAD SEX
OR ORAL SEX,

28:46.558 --> 28:48.527
EVERY TIME I MADE A DELIVERY.

28:48.560 --> 28:53.132
WE'D PLAY GAMES, ROLE-PLAY.
YOU KNOW, IT GOT PRETTY KINKY.

28:53.165 --> 28:54.967
- CAN YOU TELL ME
HOW THAT RELATIONSHIP

28:55.001 --> 28:57.904
LED TO THE EVENTS OF
THE 13TH OF FEBRUARY?

28:57.937 --> 29:01.240
- WELL, HER HUSBAND
WAS IN HONG KONG,

29:01.273 --> 29:03.475
AND WE WERE GONNA SHACK UP
FOR A FEW DAYS,

29:03.509 --> 29:04.977
BUT SHE FOUND OUT
HE WAS COMING HOME EARLY,

29:05.011 --> 29:07.880
SO SHE CAME UP WITH THIS PLAN.

29:07.914 --> 29:10.116
- TELL ME ABOUT THE PLAN.

29:10.149 --> 29:12.785
- SHE WANTED ME TO PRETEND
TO RAPE HER, WHICH I DID.

29:12.819 --> 29:15.121
SHE TIMED IT SO SHE'D BE
VIDEO CHATTING WITH HIM

29:15.154 --> 29:16.555
WHEN I "KIDNAPPED HER."

29:16.588 --> 29:17.990
SHE WANTED HIM TO SEE
THE WHOLE THING.

29:18.024 --> 29:19.792
- AND DID YOU KNOW
THAT SHE WAS GONNA

29:19.826 --> 29:21.861
ASK HER HUSBAND FOR RANSOM?

29:21.894 --> 29:23.863
- NO, I FREAKED.
BUT YOU KNOW, SHE TOLD ME

29:23.896 --> 29:25.798
IT MADE HER HOTTER
LIKE WHEN I HIT HER OVE--

29:25.832 --> 29:28.100
- MR. FAHEY,
CAN YOU PLEASE TELL US

29:28.134 --> 29:31.137
ABOUT THE CONVICTION
ON YOUR RECORD?

29:33.572 --> 29:36.943
- WHEN I WAS 19,
I COMMITTED AN ARMED ROBBERY.

29:36.976 --> 29:39.979
I SERVED MY TIME AND I DEEPLY
REGRET MY ACTIONS.

29:40.012 --> 29:41.814
- THANK YOU.

29:41.848 --> 29:44.984
NOTHING FURTHER.

29:45.017 --> 29:47.186
- THANK YOU.

29:47.219 --> 29:49.956
MR. FAHEY.

29:49.989 --> 29:50.957
WHERE DO YOU LIVE?

29:50.990 --> 29:53.225
- STATEN ISLAND.
- STATEN ISLAND.

29:53.259 --> 29:55.194
IN YOUR MOTHER'S HOME, RIGHT?
- YES.

29:55.227 --> 29:57.096
- AND YOU HAVE
A HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION?

29:57.129 --> 29:59.465
- I GOT MY G.E.D.
- IN PRISON, RIGHT?

29:59.498 --> 30:01.000
- YEAH.

30:01.033 --> 30:02.835
- WOULD YOU MIND SPEAKING UP
A BIT, MR. FAHEY?

30:02.869 --> 30:05.104
- YES, IN PRISON.

30:05.137 --> 30:06.105
- THANK YOU.

30:06.138 --> 30:07.073
AND WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME

30:07.106 --> 30:11.577
YOU HAD ANY SORT OF SERIOUS
RELATIONSHIP?

30:11.610 --> 30:14.580
- I GUESS...WITH CHRISTINE.

30:14.613 --> 30:18.284
- THIS SUPPOSED RELATIONSHIP
WITH MRS. HARTWELL,

30:18.317 --> 30:20.152
IS THERE ANY PROOF?
EMAIL, TEXTS, CALLS?

30:20.186 --> 30:23.055
- WELL, SHE TOLD ME
NEVER TO CALL.

30:23.089 --> 30:24.623
IF SHE WANTED TO SEE ME,

30:24.656 --> 30:26.859
SHE'D JUST, YOU KNOW,
PUT IN AN ORDER.

30:26.893 --> 30:29.361
- SO IT'S YOUR TESTIMONY
THAT THIS ATTRACTIVE,

30:29.395 --> 30:32.431
EDUCATED WIFE AND MOTHER

30:32.464 --> 30:36.068
DEMANDED THAT YOU RAPE HER,
THAT YOU KIDNAP HER,

30:36.102 --> 30:41.140
THAT YOU BRUTALIZE HER
UNDER A DRUG-FUELED SEX BINGE

30:41.173 --> 30:44.176
WHILE HER HUSBAND
PAYS A RANSOM.

30:48.447 --> 30:49.648
- PRETTY MUCH.

30:49.681 --> 30:54.553
- FORGIVE ME FOR SAYING THIS,
BUT THAT STRAINS CREDULITY.

30:54.586 --> 30:57.056
THAT MEANS I FIND THAT
VERY HARD TO BELIEVE.

30:57.089 --> 30:58.590
- IS THERE A QUESTION HERE,
YOUR HONOR?

30:58.624 --> 31:01.627
- TELL ME, DO ANY OF YOUR
FRIENDS OR COWORKERS

31:01.660 --> 31:04.296
KNOW ABOUT THIS RELATIONSHIP?

31:04.330 --> 31:05.497
- NO.

31:05.531 --> 31:06.665
- SO THE ONLY PEOPLE YOU TOLD

31:06.698 --> 31:08.500
WERE THE POLICE
AFTER THEY ARRESTED YOU?

31:08.534 --> 31:10.669
- NOW YOU'RE TWISTING THINGS.
- AM I?

31:10.702 --> 31:13.039
AND WHILE THEY WERE
INTERROGATING YOU,

31:13.072 --> 31:14.540
DID THEY TELL YOU
THAT YOU WERE LOOKING

31:14.573 --> 31:17.343
AT 25 YEARS TO LIFE IN PRISON?

31:17.376 --> 31:19.645
- IT CAME UP.

31:19.678 --> 31:23.049
- AND HAVE YOU NOW, IN EXCHANGE
FOR YOUR PORNOGRAPHY-FUELED

31:23.082 --> 31:24.984
FANTASY--
- OBJECTION!

31:25.017 --> 31:26.052
- SUSTAINED.

31:26.085 --> 31:27.553
- IN EXCHANGE FOR YOUR TESTIMONY

31:27.586 --> 31:30.189
AGAINST MY CLIENT,
WERE YOU ALLOWED TO PLEAD

31:30.222 --> 31:32.191
TO A MISDEMEANOR
FOR WHICH YOU WILL SERVE

31:32.224 --> 31:35.261
FEWER THAN SIX MONTHS?
- YEAH, BUT--

31:35.294 --> 31:36.963
- YOU CUT A GOOD DEAL,
MR. FAHEY.

31:36.996 --> 31:38.530
- I'M NOT MAKING THIS UP.

31:38.564 --> 31:40.967
I NEVER TOLD ANYONE BECAUSE--
- NO FURTHER QUESTIONS.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.101
- BECAUSE CHRISTINE TOLD ME

31:42.134 --> 31:43.635
THAT THE GUY BEFORE ME
STARTED TO BRAG.

31:43.669 --> 31:44.436
- NOTHING FURTHER.

31:44.470 --> 31:46.672
- SO SHE STOPPED
GETTING DELIVERIES

31:46.705 --> 31:47.539
FROM THE COMPANY
THAT USED THE SERVICE.

31:47.573 --> 31:48.540
- OBJECTION!

31:48.574 --> 31:50.542
WE WERE NEVER GIVEN NOTICE

31:50.576 --> 31:51.543
OF THAT TESTIMONY.

31:51.577 --> 31:53.545
- SUSTAINED.

31:53.579 --> 31:57.349
- THE JURY WILL DISREGARD
THE WITNESS' LAST COMMENT.

32:03.622 --> 32:05.057
- KEVIN'S LYING.

32:05.091 --> 32:06.125
HE'S MAKING IT UP.

32:06.158 --> 32:08.527
- MRS. HARTWELL, WE WENT OVER
THIS EXTENSIVELY.

32:08.560 --> 32:10.696
IF THERE IS ANYTHING
IN YOUR PAST THAT CAN HURT US,

32:10.729 --> 32:13.132
WE NEED TO--
- SHE TOLD YOU EVERYTHING.

32:13.165 --> 32:15.634
- I NEED TO HAVE SOME TIME
WITH YOUR WIFE, OKAY?

32:15.667 --> 32:18.670
- HEY, BOYD,
WILL YOU GET ME SOME CIGARETTES?

32:20.706 --> 32:22.541
- SO THIS FORMER DELIVERY MAN,
IF HE'S OUT THERE...

32:22.574 --> 32:24.676
- OH, HE'S OUT THERE.
- WE'LL FIND HIM.

32:24.710 --> 32:25.978
- I NEED HIS NAME.
- WHAT?

32:26.012 --> 32:27.613
- NOW.

32:27.646 --> 32:28.614
- BRAD.

32:28.647 --> 32:30.549
SOMETHING WITH AN "H"?

32:30.582 --> 32:33.019
PHX DELIVERY,
BUT NOTHING HAPPENED.

32:33.052 --> 32:37.289
- WHY DID YOU STOP
USING PHX DELIVERY?

32:37.323 --> 32:39.358
- BECAUSE MY NEIGHBOR SAID
HE WAS GOSSIPING ABOUT ME.

32:39.391 --> 32:42.394
- OH, DID THEY?
AND HE HAD NO REASON TO?

32:42.428 --> 32:44.330
YOU'VE DAMAGED YOUR CREDIBILITY
WITH THE JURY,

32:44.363 --> 32:45.664
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT I CAN DO
TO WIN IT BACK.

32:45.697 --> 32:48.700
- I HAVE TO USE THE BATHROOM.

32:52.704 --> 32:55.274
- SO WE'RE CLEAR,
I WASN'T SANDBAGGING YOU.

32:55.307 --> 32:57.709
I HAD NO IDEA THAT WAS COMING.
- RIGHT.

32:57.743 --> 33:00.279
YOU KNOW WHY I LOVE
CASES LIKE THIS?

33:00.312 --> 33:02.081
- HMM?

33:02.114 --> 33:05.117
- 'CAUSE THERE'S ALWAYS
ANOTHER SHOW.

33:11.590 --> 33:13.492
- I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU COULD SMOKE IN HERE.

33:13.525 --> 33:15.327
- I DON'T THINK YOU CAN.

33:15.361 --> 33:18.364
- DO YOU HAVE AN EXTRA?

33:27.239 --> 33:29.075
- BRAD HAYES.

33:29.108 --> 33:30.676
- OKAY, I'LL MOVE THE TRUCK.

33:30.709 --> 33:33.245
- DO YOU KNOW
CHRISTINE HARTWELL?

33:33.279 --> 33:35.281
- CHRISTINE.

33:35.314 --> 33:36.648
OH, YEAH.

33:36.682 --> 33:38.684
I KNOW HER.

33:41.653 --> 33:44.590
- WHAT WASN'T ON THAT TAPE...

33:44.623 --> 33:50.096
IS WHAT HE SAID
AND DID TO ME JUST BEFORE.

33:50.129 --> 33:53.665
HE HELD A GUN ON ME.

33:53.699 --> 33:56.068
HE SAID HE'D KILL ME.

33:56.102 --> 33:59.605
KILL MY FAMILY
IF I DIDN'T DO WHAT HE WANTED.

33:59.638 --> 34:01.807
- TELL ME, MRS. HARTWELL, DO YOU
SEE THE MAN WHO DID THIS TO YOU

34:01.840 --> 34:03.809
SOMEWHERE IN THIS COURTROOM?

34:03.842 --> 34:06.078
- YES.

34:06.112 --> 34:09.148
KEVIN FAHEY.

34:09.181 --> 34:11.817
- MRS. HARTWELL, CAN YOU
DESCRIBE YOUR STATE OF MIND

34:11.850 --> 34:14.553
DURING THIS ORDEAL?

34:14.586 --> 34:16.688
- WELL, I WAS TERRIFIED
FOR MY FAMILY.

34:16.722 --> 34:19.625
- DID YOU HAVE A PRIOR
RELATIONSHIP WITH KEVIN FAHEY

34:19.658 --> 34:24.196
BEFORE THIS BRUTAL RAPE
AND ABDUCTION?

34:24.230 --> 34:27.599
- HE DELIVERED PACKAGES.

34:27.633 --> 34:31.603
CLOTHES FOR MY HUSBAND,
TOYS FOR MY DAUGHTER.

34:31.637 --> 34:33.772
THERE WAS NO RELATIONSHIP.

34:33.805 --> 34:35.274
- HMM, I SEE.

34:35.307 --> 34:38.210
AND DID YOU EVER INVITE HIM
INTO YOUR HOME?

34:38.244 --> 34:41.647
- ABSOLUTELY NOT.

34:41.680 --> 34:43.649
I'M A POLITE PERSON.
IF HE MISCONSTRUED THAT--

34:43.682 --> 34:45.584
- YOU HAVE NOTHING TO BLAME
YOURSELF FOR, MRS.--

34:45.617 --> 34:46.818
- OKAY, IS THERE A QUESTION
HERE, YOUR HONOR?

34:46.852 --> 34:48.754
- YES, LET'S KEEP MOVING,
MR. EXLEY.

34:48.787 --> 34:51.723
- OF COURSE.

34:51.757 --> 34:54.593
NOW, MRS. HARTWELL,
EARLIER WE HEARD A TESTIMONY

34:54.626 --> 34:59.665
FROM BRAD HAYES, A DELIVERY MAN
FOR PHX, AND HE TESTIFIED

34:59.698 --> 35:01.667
THAT HE HAD SOME SORT OF
RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU.

35:01.700 --> 35:03.702
WHY WOULD HE SAY
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

35:03.735 --> 35:06.338
- I HAVE NO IDEA.

35:06.372 --> 35:07.839
I BARELY REMEMBER HIM.

35:07.873 --> 35:11.743
- DID YOU, IN FACT, EVER HAVE
A RELATIONSHIP WITH BRAD HAYES?

35:11.777 --> 35:15.647
- ABSOLUTELY NOT.

35:15.681 --> 35:19.651
TWO YEARS AGO,
MY DAUGHTER WAS THREE.

35:19.685 --> 35:21.620
I WAS HOME ALL DAY.

35:21.653 --> 35:25.691
THE NANNY, THE HOUSEKEEPER,
I WAS NEVER ALONE.

35:25.724 --> 35:30.596
I WAS BUSY TAKING CARE OF
MY LITTLE GIRL AND MY HUSBAND.

35:30.629 --> 35:32.864
- THANK YOU.

35:32.898 --> 35:35.901
NO FURTHER QUESTIONS.

35:37.736 --> 35:41.873
- SO...JUST FOR ME TO RECAP,

35:41.907 --> 35:45.444
YOUR TESTIMONY IS THAT YOU WERE
KIDNAPPED AT GUNPOINT

35:45.477 --> 35:46.645
BY THREE BLACK MEN AND--

35:46.678 --> 35:48.180
- NO.
- I'M SORRY.

35:48.214 --> 35:51.583
THAT WAS YOUR ORIGINAL
REPORT TO THE POLICE.

35:51.617 --> 35:53.552
YOU LATER TESTIFIED
THAT YOU WERE KIDNAPPED

35:53.585 --> 35:56.622
BY YOUR BIG, GREEN DELIVERY MAN
AND THEN TAKEN TO

35:56.655 --> 35:58.757
YOUR HUSBAND'S BUSINESS
PARTNER'S HIDEAWAY--

35:58.790 --> 36:01.627
A LOFT YOU CLAIM
YOU'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE--

36:01.660 --> 36:04.463
AND YOU WERE RAPED THERE

36:04.496 --> 36:09.935
UNTIL YOU WERE SENT TO RECOVER
YOUR OWN RANSOM?

36:09.968 --> 36:14.740
- I KNOW YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME,
BUT THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

36:14.773 --> 36:17.676
IF I WAS MAKING UP A STORY,
WHY WOULD I TELL THAT ONE?

36:17.709 --> 36:21.213
- INDEED? WHY WOULD YOU?

36:21.247 --> 36:24.316
BRAD HAYES...

36:27.686 --> 36:32.691
NOW, THIS IS A MAN YOU CLAIM
YOU BARELY RECOGNIZE, RIGHT?

36:32.724 --> 36:36.728
PEOPLE'S EVIDENCE 608,
YOUR HONOR.

36:36.762 --> 36:39.665
BRAD HAYES' PHX DELIVERY
SCHEDULE FOR THE NINE MONTHS

36:39.698 --> 36:40.732
HE WAS ON THE HARTWELL'S ROUTE.

36:40.766 --> 36:45.371
THE AVERAGE TIME BETWEEN
SIGNATURES FOR DELIVERIES

36:45.404 --> 36:48.740
IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD,
IT'S ONLY 12 MINUTES.

36:48.774 --> 36:50.942
BUT THE AVERAGE TIME
BETWEEN YOUR SIGNATURE

36:50.976 --> 36:54.746
AND THE NEXT DELIVERY
IS 40 MINUTES.

36:54.780 --> 36:57.749
CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT?

36:57.783 --> 36:59.618
- HE MUST HAVE GONE FOR LUNCH?

36:59.651 --> 37:02.954
- SURE.

37:02.988 --> 37:06.692
THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF DELIVERIES
IS FOUR A WEEK--

37:06.725 --> 37:09.595
SAME AS KEVIN FAHEY--
FOR NINE MONTHS UNTIL,

37:09.628 --> 37:12.664
SUDDENLY YOU STOP ORDERING
FROM COMPANIES THAT USE PHX.

37:12.698 --> 37:15.701
WHY IS THAT?

37:18.737 --> 37:21.673
- I HEARD HE WAS MAKING RUDE
COMMENTS ABOUT ME.

37:23.575 --> 37:27.879
- MRS. HARTWELL, WE'VE HEARD
TESTIMONY FROM KEVIN FAHEY

37:27.913 --> 37:30.849
THAT YOU TWO HAD A CONSENSUAL
SEXUAL RELATIONSHIP.

37:30.882 --> 37:32.584
- HE'S LYING.

37:32.618 --> 37:35.587
- AND SO WAS YOUR HUSBAND'S
BUSINESS PARTNER, JUSTIN GELD,

37:35.621 --> 37:38.657
WHEN HE TESTIFIED THAT YOU TWO
HAD SEX IN HIS LOFT?

37:38.690 --> 37:40.659
- YES.
- AND NOW BRAD HAYES?

37:40.692 --> 37:44.029
- SO ALL THREE MEN WERE LYING
WHEN THEY TESTIFIED UNDER OATH

37:44.062 --> 37:46.498
THAT THEY HAD SEX WITH YOU?
- YES, THAT'S CORRECT.

37:46.532 --> 37:49.335
- AH, AND THE VIDEOTAPE
THE JURORS SAW, RIGHT?

37:49.368 --> 37:54.673
THAT--THAT--THAT WAS LYING TOO,
WASN'T IT?

37:54.706 --> 37:58.377
- BECAUSE I'M FORTUNATE ENOUGH
TO HAVE A WONDERFUL FAMILY,

37:58.410 --> 38:00.912
A COMFORTABLE HOME...

38:00.946 --> 38:03.649
SOME PEOPLE SEE ME AS...

38:03.682 --> 38:05.351
PRIVILEGED.

38:05.384 --> 38:06.718
THEY THINK THAT
I'M SELF-CENTERED,

38:06.752 --> 38:08.053
THAT I TAKE THINGS
FOR GRANTED,

38:08.086 --> 38:12.724
BUT THAT COULDN'T BE ANY FURTHER
FROM THE TRUTH.

38:12.758 --> 38:17.929
WHAT YOU SEE ON THAT TAPE IS...
IS ME FIGHTING FOR MY LIFE.

38:17.963 --> 38:20.766
AND THE ONLY THING
GOING THROUGH MY MIND

38:20.799 --> 38:24.670
WAS "WOULD I EVER
SEE MY FAMILY AGAIN?"

38:26.938 --> 38:30.676
I DID WHATEVER I HAD TO DO
TO SURVIVE.

38:35.547 --> 38:36.648
- NOTHING FURTHER.

38:46.157 --> 38:48.594
- YOUR HONOR,
WE ARE UNABLE TO REACH

38:48.627 --> 38:51.062
A UNANIMOUS VERDICT
IN THIS MATTER.

38:51.096 --> 38:52.631
- I DON'T ACCEPT THAT,

38:52.664 --> 38:55.634
AND I ORDER THE JURY
TO CONTINUE TO DELIBERATE.

38:55.667 --> 38:57.035
- SIDEBAR?

38:57.068 --> 38:58.404
- APPROACH.

39:01.907 --> 39:03.875
- YOUR HONOR, I HAVE REASON
TO BELIEVE THE DEFENDANT

39:03.909 --> 39:06.011
IS INFLUENCING ONE OF
THE JURORS IN THIS CASE.

39:06.044 --> 39:07.779
- BASED ON WHAT, MS. NOVAK?

39:07.813 --> 39:09.615
- I'VE WITNESSED EYE CONTACT
ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION

39:09.648 --> 39:11.683
BOTH INSIDE THE COURTROOM
AND OUTSIDE THE COURTROOM--

39:11.717 --> 39:12.518
- THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

39:12.551 --> 39:13.385
PROSECUTION
IS GRASPING AT STRAWS.

39:13.419 --> 39:15.587
THE WHOLE CASE IS BASED
ON THE TESTIMONY

39:15.621 --> 39:17.589
OF A CONVICTED FELON,
A DRUG DEALER,

39:17.623 --> 39:18.690
AND A CORRUPT BUSINESS PARTNER.

39:18.724 --> 39:20.726
- YOU'VE GOTTA BE KIDDING--
- ALL RIGHT, MR. EXLEY.

39:20.759 --> 39:24.396
MS. NOVAK, I WILL
QUESTION THE JUROR.

39:24.430 --> 39:26.698
- YOUR HONOR, WE MAY HAVE PASSED
EACH OTHER ONCE OR TWICE...

39:26.732 --> 39:29.501
IN THE HALLWAY OR ON THE STAIRS.

39:29.535 --> 39:34.673
- NO OUTSIDE CONTACT, NO CALLS,
TEXTS, SOCIAL MEDIA INTERACTION?

39:34.706 --> 39:37.709
- I'M A HAPPILY MARRIED MAN.

39:39.745 --> 39:41.947
- THANK YOU, YOU'RE DISMISSED.

39:43.749 --> 39:44.950
- ANY OTHER TRICKS, MS. NOVAK?

39:44.983 --> 39:46.752
- I KNOW WHAT I SAW.

39:46.785 --> 39:48.754
- UNLESS YOU HAVE EVIDENCE OF
IMPROPER COMMUNICATION,

39:48.787 --> 39:51.723
I'M NOT DISMISSING A JUROR
FOR MAKING EYE CONTACT.

39:51.757 --> 39:53.158
- [clears throat]

39:55.794 --> 39:58.129
- YOUR HONOR, I'M SORRY,

39:58.163 --> 40:00.499
WE REMAIN HOPELESSLY
DEADLOCKED.

40:02.534 --> 40:04.603
- THE CASE OF NEW YORK
AGAINST CHRISTINE HARTWELL

40:04.636 --> 40:07.839
IS HEREBY DECLARED A MISTRIAL.

40:07.873 --> 40:09.975
THE STATE OF NEW YORK THANKS YOU
FOR YOUR SERVICE.

40:10.008 --> 40:11.777
YOU'RE DISMISSED.

40:11.810 --> 40:13.545
[bangs gavel]

40:31.697 --> 40:34.199
- THIS CASE
WAS A DOG FROM THE GET.

40:34.232 --> 40:36.702
- TRY IT AGAIN.
SHE'S GUILTY.

40:36.735 --> 40:38.637
- I'LL DO MY BEST,
BUT THERE'S NOT A CHANCE

40:38.670 --> 40:41.072
THE BOSSES WILL LET
THIS GO TO RETRIAL.

40:41.106 --> 40:43.642
- HEY, EXCUSE ME, MA'AM.

40:43.675 --> 40:45.844
- YOU MIND TELLING US
WHAT WENT ON IN THERE?

40:45.877 --> 40:47.613
- 11-TO-1, GUILTY.

40:47.646 --> 40:49.548
EXCEPT FOR THIS ONE JUROR.

40:49.581 --> 40:51.016
HE SAYS HE LOOKED IN HER EYES,

40:51.049 --> 40:53.719
AND HE JUST KNEW SHE
WAS TELLING THE TRUTH.

40:53.752 --> 40:55.654
- THANK YOU.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

40:55.687 --> 40:57.789
- I LOVE MY WIFE.

40:57.823 --> 41:00.559
AND I HAVE STOOD BY HER
AND BELIEVED HER

41:00.592 --> 41:03.061
THROUGH EVERY SECOND OF
THIS HORRIFIC NIGHTMARE.

41:03.094 --> 41:05.664
SHE HAS BEEN TO HELL AND BACK.

41:05.697 --> 41:07.966
FIRST, RAPED BY
A BRUTAL ASSAILANT

41:07.999 --> 41:10.602
AND THEN RAPED AGAIN
BY THE STATE,

41:10.636 --> 41:13.772
AND FORCED TO SUFFER THROUGH
THIS TRAVESTY OF A TRIAL.

41:13.805 --> 41:16.642
MY WIFE IS THE BRAVEST
WOMAN I KNOW.

41:16.675 --> 41:18.744
SHE IS A SURVIVOR.

41:18.777 --> 41:21.713
WE LOOK FORWARD
TO PUTTING THIS BEHIND US

41:21.747 --> 41:23.014
AND MOVING ON WITH OUR LIVES,

41:23.048 --> 41:25.283
KNOWING THAT THE STRENGTH
OF OUR LOVE

41:25.316 --> 41:27.686
HAS ONLY GROWN STRONGER
THROUGH THIS ORDEAL.

41:27.719 --> 41:33.825
