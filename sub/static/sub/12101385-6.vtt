13:06.542 --> 13:08.250
Jesus Christ, Mare.

13:08.333 --> 13:11.792
(CHUCKLES) Yeah, I was...
Yeah, I was lucky.

13:11.875 --> 13:14.917
-Could've been a lot worse.
-I'm sorry about your colleague.

13:15.583 --> 13:16.583
That...

13:18.000 --> 13:21.208
-that's gotta be tough.
-MARE: Zabel.

13:21.291 --> 13:25.041
-His name was Colin Zabel.
-(SIGHS)

13:25.750 --> 13:26.750
Yeah.

13:28.375 --> 13:29.417
It is.

13:30.417 --> 13:31.917
-Yeah.
-(RICHARD SIGHS)

13:33.250 --> 13:35.792
But you found those two girls.

13:35.875 --> 13:38.458
I mean, your--
your dad would be proud, hmm?

13:38.542 --> 13:40.750
-(BOTTLE THUDS)
-(CLEARS THROAT)

13:43.041 --> 13:45.208
Yeah. Um...

13:45.291 --> 13:48.333
Hey, can I, uh,
confess something?

13:48.417 --> 13:49.583
RICHARD: Yeah.

13:49.667 --> 13:51.458
MARE:
You know how I cancelled on you

13:51.542 --> 13:53.000
the night of your birthday?

13:53.083 --> 13:56.250
It's because I went out
on a date with Colin.

13:56.333 --> 13:58.083
He was just a friend, but...

13:59.792 --> 14:01.458
It wasn't the right thing to do.

14:02.792 --> 14:04.417
Well, it's okay.

14:04.500 --> 14:06.417
We never made any promises,
right?

14:07.333 --> 14:08.834
MARE: Yeah, I know. But...

14:10.291 --> 14:13.333
-I wanted to tell you.
-Yeah, it's okay.

14:22.917 --> 14:25.166
I gotta get my shit together,
Richard.

14:29.709 --> 14:30.959
I can't do this.

14:37.583 --> 14:38.667
I'll tell you what.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.375
Uh, how about
when you feel ready--

14:42.458 --> 14:43.667
if you feel ready...

14:45.709 --> 14:48.375
you give me a call
and ask me out.

14:49.750 --> 14:52.250
-Okay?
-MARE: How do I know

14:52.333 --> 14:54.291
you won't be spoken for by then?

14:54.917 --> 14:56.500
RICHARD: Well, you don't.

14:56.583 --> 14:58.959
But, you know, I'm 52 years old,

14:59.041 --> 15:01.542
and I'm living in Easttown,
so...

15:01.625 --> 15:04.041
I'd say your odds
are pretty good. (CHUCKLES)

15:10.208 --> 15:11.834
BALLISTICS EXPERT:
See these striations here?

15:11.917 --> 15:14.458
In most guns,
the rifling goes to the right.

15:14.542 --> 15:16.250
But Colt guns are unique.

15:16.333 --> 15:17.917
They have a left-hand
barrel twist.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.291
Like we see on the bullet
we found lodged into the tree

15:20.375 --> 15:22.125
at Brandywine Park.

15:22.208 --> 15:25.333
I did some comparisons.
The weapon that killed Erin

15:25.417 --> 15:27.458
is a Colt Detective Special
revolver.

15:27.542 --> 15:28.625
An old cop carry?

15:28.709 --> 15:31.583
BALLISTICS EXPERT: That's right.
Popular in the '80s.

15:31.667 --> 15:33.417
Your dad probably had one, Mare.

15:33.500 --> 15:34.625
Are they still around?

15:34.709 --> 15:38.000
-Nah. Production stopped in '95.
-Sorry to interrupt.

15:38.083 --> 15:40.667
Brianna Delrasso
is on the phone for you, Mare.

15:43.792 --> 15:45.834
BRIANNA DELRASSO: I woke up
at 2:00 in the morning.

15:46.709 --> 15:48.083
And Dylan wasn't in bed.

15:50.542 --> 15:52.709
So I walked around.

15:52.792 --> 15:54.917
He-- he wasn't anywhere
in the house either.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.291
So you lied to us before

15:56.375 --> 15:58.750
when you said
Dylan was home all night.

16:02.583 --> 16:04.625
MARE:
You know how this looks, right?

16:05.542 --> 16:07.917
This just looks
like you've come forward

16:08.000 --> 16:09.959
because you want us to help
with your assault case.

16:10.041 --> 16:11.750
No, I'm not asking you
for anything.

16:11.834 --> 16:13.750
-MARE: Come on.
-I swear, I'm not.

16:14.834 --> 16:17.375
Look, I'm just trying do
the right thing, okay?

16:19.250 --> 16:21.375
For Erin, and f-- for that baby.

16:22.667 --> 16:24.250
All right.

16:24.333 --> 16:27.208
Well,
we're gonna look into this.

16:29.041 --> 16:32.000
And you may have to come down
to the station

16:32.083 --> 16:34.083
and sign a statement.

16:35.750 --> 16:37.417
We appreciate you calling us.

16:42.834 --> 16:44.166
Mare.

16:44.250 --> 16:47.625
Listen, I, uh,
wanna say sorry...

16:48.959 --> 16:50.458
about the way I behaved before.

16:51.625 --> 16:53.083
It's a brave thing you did.

16:54.125 --> 16:55.417
Saving those girls.

16:57.041 --> 16:58.291
Bringing Katie home.

17:05.709 --> 17:09.250
MARE: I'm sure you've seen
the news about Wayne Potts.

17:09.333 --> 17:10.375
DYLAN HINCHEY: Yeah.

17:10.458 --> 17:12.041
MARE: So we, uh,
called you in here

17:12.125 --> 17:15.625
just to wrap up
some details on Erin's case.

17:15.709 --> 17:18.000
Um, I need you to
walk me through

17:18.083 --> 17:19.375
the night of January 10th,

17:19.458 --> 17:23.250
and, uh, I'll write it all down
in a formal statement. Okay?

17:23.333 --> 17:26.291
-DYLAN: What for?
-We just need to file

17:26.375 --> 17:28.917
the relevant statements
for the DA's office.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.125
All right. Um, well,

17:31.208 --> 17:33.083
like I told you guys
ten times already,

17:33.166 --> 17:37.166
I left the woods, 11:45.
Got home around midnight.

17:38.208 --> 17:39.083
Went to bed.

17:39.166 --> 17:41.667
-CARTER: With Brianna Delrasso?
-Yeah.

17:41.750 --> 17:44.333
And, uh,
that was a good night's sleep?

17:45.041 --> 17:46.834
I mean, you fell asleep

17:46.917 --> 17:49.166
and then didn't wake up
until the morning?

17:49.959 --> 17:51.000
Yeah.

17:52.250 --> 17:53.667
MARE:
'Cause we just spoke to Brianna.

17:53.750 --> 17:56.250
And, uh, she said
you weren't home that night.

17:56.333 --> 17:58.125
That when she woke up
at 2:00 in the morning,

17:58.208 --> 18:00.792
you weren't beside her
and you weren't in the house.

18:03.500 --> 18:05.917
I couldn't sleep,
so I drove around a bit.

18:06.041 --> 18:08.041
Smoked a bit of weed.

18:08.125 --> 18:10.792
-MARE: Alone?
-Yeah. Why? I mean, what--

18:10.875 --> 18:12.750
what difference
does any of this make?

18:12.834 --> 18:13.959
All right, you guys just said

18:14.041 --> 18:16.709
you were just
tying up loose ends, right?

18:16.792 --> 18:19.333
MARE:
Wayne Potts didn't kill Erin.

18:22.041 --> 18:24.000
But you already knew that,
didn't you?

18:24.959 --> 18:27.083
Did you steal
Erin's journals, Dylan?

18:27.166 --> 18:29.000
-(DYLAN SCOFFS)
-Was there something in there

18:29.083 --> 18:31.208
you're trying to hide? Huh?

18:38.166 --> 18:39.500
I think I want a lawyer.

18:40.375 --> 18:43.542
That's smart.
Yeah. I would, too.

18:43.625 --> 18:46.041
And when you call, tell them
your alibi's falling apart

18:46.125 --> 18:47.709
and the Easttown
Police Department just said

18:47.792 --> 18:50.291
you're the prime suspect
in a murder investigation.

18:51.750 --> 18:53.583
(PEN CLICKS, CLATTERS)

18:53.667 --> 18:55.500
So, I talked with that professor

18:55.583 --> 18:58.834
-from Berkeley this morning.
-Yeah? And?

18:58.917 --> 19:02.834
She's great. Totally inspiring.
(CHUCKLES) Just like you said.

19:02.917 --> 19:05.375
She wants me to fly out
and visit campus.

19:05.458 --> 19:06.583
Are you going to?

19:07.625 --> 19:08.834
I don't know.

19:08.917 --> 19:11.625
I don't know that my parents
would want me to go that far.

19:11.709 --> 19:13.125
Well, have they said that?

19:14.250 --> 19:17.375
-Not exactly.
-Then what's stopping you?

19:19.333 --> 19:21.333
Maybe you're what's stopping me.

19:21.417 --> 19:24.750
(LAUGHS) Siobhan, we just
started seeing each other.

19:24.834 --> 19:27.458
I've had colds that have lasted
longer than our relationship.

19:27.542 --> 19:30.709
-Ew. Colds? Seriously. Come on.
-No, sorry. Bad analogy.

19:30.792 --> 19:34.000
I'm just saying--
Siobhan, I like you.

19:34.917 --> 19:36.250
We have fun together.

19:36.333 --> 19:38.291
-(SIOBHAN CHUCKLES)
-The sex is good.

19:39.709 --> 19:42.125
Things don't have to last
forever to matter.

19:43.250 --> 19:46.083
I can't be the reason you stay.
I don't want that.

19:48.959 --> 19:51.458
What if I don't give you
a choice?

19:51.542 --> 19:53.834
Oh, well... (CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

19:57.583 --> 20:00.792
(MUSIC PLAYING INDISTINCTLY)

20:03.959 --> 20:05.375
You all right?

20:05.458 --> 20:09.083
(SIGHS) Just tired.
I slept three hours last night.

20:09.166 --> 20:10.792
I'm on till 2:00 here,
and then I'm back

20:10.875 --> 20:13.208
-cleaning offices at 6:00.
-Oof.

20:14.542 --> 20:15.709
Need a little pick-me-up?

20:16.834 --> 20:18.166
Energizer Bunnies.

20:19.417 --> 20:20.500
It's fine.

20:21.667 --> 20:22.709
Go ahead.

20:23.458 --> 20:25.375
-No, thanks.
-Okay.

20:36.792 --> 20:38.792
Well, I'm just so glad
to see you again, Mare.

20:38.875 --> 20:39.959
I've been...

20:40.041 --> 20:43.375
watching you all over the news.
I mean...

20:43.458 --> 20:45.375
How-- how have you been
managing the attention?

20:45.458 --> 20:47.875
Oh, I don't know that I have.
I've been, uh... (CHUCKLES)

20:47.959 --> 20:50.917
-...trying to avoid it, mostly.
-Well, why'd you come back?

20:51.000 --> 20:53.750
The department isn't requiring
you to be here anymore,

20:53.834 --> 20:55.834
so what's different this time?

20:56.709 --> 21:01.208
I can, uh,
feel it happening again.

21:02.250 --> 21:05.125
What do you feel happening,
exactly?

21:05.208 --> 21:06.625
I feel, like-- like panic.

21:06.709 --> 21:10.333
Um, like this expectation
from people to be...

21:10.417 --> 21:13.792
something I don't think
I'm good enough to be.

21:13.875 --> 21:14.917
And, uh...

21:16.083 --> 21:18.458
GAYLE: Well, can you tell me
what would make you feel

21:18.542 --> 21:19.875
-good enough?
-(LAUGHS) No.

21:19.959 --> 21:22.208
-(GAYLE CHUCKLES)
-Um... (CLICKS TONGUE)

21:24.333 --> 21:26.458
Uh, no. I-- (SIGHS)

21:26.542 --> 21:30.208
I can't... think of, um...

21:31.375 --> 21:32.375
(MARE CHUCKLES)

21:32.458 --> 21:35.417
Well, would you mind
if I shared some insights?

21:36.208 --> 21:37.250
MARE: Sure.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.834
I-- I'm worried

21:39.917 --> 21:43.792
you haven't effectively grieved
your son's death.

21:46.542 --> 21:47.583
Okay.

21:49.208 --> 21:50.542
GAYLE: I think you've sought out

21:50.625 --> 21:54.542
an external solution
to your internal pain.

21:54.625 --> 21:57.917
You've been hiding behind
other people's grief.

22:00.750 --> 22:03.875
First, Katie Bailey.
Now, Erin McMenamin.

22:04.750 --> 22:08.083
But even after these cases
get solved,

22:08.166 --> 22:10.083
the grief
is still gonna be there

22:10.166 --> 22:13.291
waiting for you,
until you confront it.

22:16.709 --> 22:17.792
Do you think...

22:19.667 --> 22:24.250
you could, uh, walk me through
the day that Kevin died?

22:25.000 --> 22:26.250
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

22:31.041 --> 22:32.250
(SIGHS)

22:33.709 --> 22:34.750
Well...

22:35.709 --> 22:39.000
Um... (SIGHS)
It was a Sunday. Mm...

22:40.625 --> 22:42.583
Neighbor called and said
that she'd seen Kevin go

22:42.667 --> 22:45.166
into the back of the house.
(SNIFFLES)

22:45.250 --> 22:49.208
He was, uh-- He'd been living
with us off and on

22:49.291 --> 22:51.375
for a while at this point,
so, you know,

22:51.458 --> 22:53.667
the neighbors kinda knew
to call if they saw him.

22:53.750 --> 22:58.709
Because, um, he'd stolen
a bunch of things from us before

22:58.792 --> 23:01.458
and, uh... you know,
we had to put the word out

23:01.542 --> 23:03.625
that if anyone
noticed him around.

23:03.709 --> 23:05.500
I just thought he was there
for drug money,

23:05.583 --> 23:06.792
like he always was.

23:08.083 --> 23:09.166
Um...

23:11.458 --> 23:12.834
Frank wasn't home that day.

23:12.917 --> 23:15.417
He'd, uh, taken Drew
to swim lessons,

23:15.500 --> 23:18.500
and I knew that Siobhan
was right around the corner
at her friend's house,

23:18.583 --> 23:20.333
so instead
of going home myself...

23:21.333 --> 23:22.917
(EXHALES)

23:23.000 --> 23:26.709
...I asked her to go check
on him for me.

driving home.

24:22.458 --> 24:23.959

24:25.208 --> 24:26.417
Hanging from the...

24:29.125 --> 24:31.834
one of the beams. He'd gotten
a tow rope from the garage.

24:31.917 --> 24:34.583
(BREATHES SHAKILY)

24:37.709 --> 24:39.041
