WEBVTT

00:02.309 --> 00:05.867
Is it scientifically
feasible for a human being to melt?

00:06.902 --> 00:09.625
Phew! This heat wave
is killing me.

00:14.818 --> 00:16.765
I know when I created
this Spider-Man look,

00:16.810 --> 00:18.404
I wanted it to be
a beacon of hope,

00:18.545 --> 00:22.521
but maybe head-to-toe spandex
wasn't the coolest idea.

00:25.802 --> 00:27.592
Third rule of superheroics:

00:27.670 --> 00:30.357
always know where the best
alleys are for changing clothes.

00:30.482 --> 00:33.076
It keeps lookie-loos
from seeing your spider-undies.

00:33.248 --> 00:35.029
Fourth rule of superheroics:

00:35.170 --> 00:37.865
never use the word "lookie-loo."

00:39.201 --> 00:40.873
Ah. Much better.

00:41.060 --> 00:43.193
And I'm even on time
to meet Harry.

00:45.545 --> 00:47.404
Are you okay?

00:47.763 --> 00:50.885
- So sorry.
- Thanks, kid.

00:53.084 --> 00:55.177
- Now get outta the way.
- Hey!

00:55.635 --> 00:57.638
Said I was sorry.
Coming through!

00:59.402 --> 01:01.310
Hold it right there,
Macklin!

01:01.873 --> 01:03.131
Nice job there, kid.

01:03.240 --> 01:05.232
You just stopped a member
of Hammerhead's gang.

01:05.435 --> 01:08.357
Randy Macklin just robbed
the jewelry store on 5th.

01:08.474 --> 01:10.871
Wish we got more help
from regular people like you.

01:10.998 --> 01:12.917
My job would be
a lot easier.

01:12.932 --> 01:15.776
Thanks.
Uh, have a good day.

01:18.214 --> 01:22.917
Wow. Guess I can be just as
effective out of my Spidey duds.

01:23.214 --> 01:25.620
I need to patrol the city
as Peter Parker...

01:25.725 --> 01:27.370
Whoa!

01:27.698 --> 01:29.777
Pete, you're a genius!

01:29.925 --> 01:32.503
Nah. I just got
in his way, really.

01:32.644 --> 01:35.284
I'm talking about
the cryogenic gauntlet.

01:35.386 --> 01:36.956
Take a look at this.

01:38.503 --> 01:40.648
I took the revised designs
you e-mailed me,

01:40.706 --> 01:43.050
realigned the coils,
and look!

01:45.403 --> 01:47.274
Whoa! We did it!

01:47.341 --> 01:50.747
We created a way to freeze food
without agents like Freon.

01:50.945 --> 01:54.014
Our joint science project
will finally show everyone

01:54.081 --> 01:57.049
that Horizon High and Osborn
Academy can work together

01:57.116 --> 01:59.385
in a friendly, noncompetitive way.

01:59.466 --> 02:02.315
Although my dad'll be furious
when he finds out.

02:02.586 --> 02:06.416
Yeah. He'll support that when
Horizon freezes over. Hmm?

02:06.499 --> 02:08.487
I only had a small refractor in my lab,

02:08.544 --> 02:10.463
so this is the biggest thing
I could freeze.

02:10.696 --> 02:13.354
But if I had something larger...

02:13.474 --> 02:16.844
- Where did this come from?
- Oh-ho, that's perfect!

02:17.071 --> 02:19.836
I don't know... Let me just
raise the level a notch,

02:19.894 --> 02:22.401
and your sandwich becomes...

02:23.932 --> 02:25.338
Whoa!

02:26.377 --> 02:28.338
Oh, that might be too much ice.

02:28.405 --> 02:30.572
No such thing as "too much ice."

02:30.680 --> 02:33.084
Huh? I know you.
Macklin!

02:33.213 --> 02:35.916
- You're that thief I stopped earlier!
- You what?

02:36.027 --> 02:38.431
I stopped him. P-Pete...

02:38.514 --> 02:40.588
Peter Parker did. I did...

02:40.816 --> 02:43.260
I helped the cops
by getting in his way.

02:43.853 --> 02:46.987
Then you helped me by
holding on to my diamond.

02:47.052 --> 02:49.620
But now I want it back.

02:50.209 --> 02:53.451
Hey! But we need that
to generate more ice.

02:53.863 --> 02:56.899
More ice, huh?
From what I just saw,

02:56.966 --> 02:59.933
maybe I should be taking this too.

03:01.269 --> 03:03.337
- Harry, are you okay?
- Don't worry.

03:03.404 --> 03:07.107
- I'll take care of him.
- Don't be a hero twice in one day, kid.

03:07.174 --> 03:10.777
Stop! You don't know what
that thing's capable of!

03:16.024 --> 03:20.848
<font color=#FF00FF>*MARVEL's SPIDER MAN*</font>
<font color=#00FF00>Season 01  Episode 12</font>
Title: <font color=#FFFF00>"Mixed Signals"</font>

03:24.043 --> 03:25.777
Not what I h-h-had in mind

03:25.835 --> 03:28.754
when I s-said I wanted
it to be c-c-cooler.

03:29.075 --> 03:31.160
Pete, we've gotta get our
gauntlet back.

03:31.218 --> 03:32.270
Huh?

03:32.328 --> 03:35.535
The only thing you've got to do
is start shoveling!

03:36.168 --> 03:37.707
In a sec, Joe.

03:37.765 --> 03:40.496
Let me just see if that cop
is still outside.

03:40.933 --> 03:42.879
Oh, no, Pete.
You are not pulling

03:42.937 --> 03:45.996
another one of your
disappearing... acts.

03:46.520 --> 03:49.824
- He coming back?
- I wouldn't count on it.

03:50.678 --> 03:52.105
Hmm?

03:53.107 --> 03:57.129
Wish I'd put a tracer on Macklin
so I knew which way he went... Huh?

03:59.426 --> 04:02.162
Well, that's a trail even
Peter Parker can follow.

04:03.121 --> 04:06.855
- Where the heck is Mackerel?
- It's "Macklin."

04:06.993 --> 04:09.864
And Frankie here thinks
he got pinched by the cops.

04:09.986 --> 04:12.629
The cops?!
How stupid can he be?

04:12.687 --> 04:14.184
This was an easy job.

04:14.242 --> 04:17.207
You break into the jewelry
store and steal a diamond.

04:17.380 --> 04:20.707
See this? This right here is why
I should only hire supervillains.

04:20.903 --> 04:24.840
They cost more, but they're
ten times better than you regular yahoos.

04:24.938 --> 04:26.746
I got it, boss.

04:27.666 --> 04:29.473
<i>Mack-a-lin!</i>

04:30.715 --> 04:33.230
I was just talking about you.

04:33.340 --> 04:35.293
I thought you were picked up
by the cops.

04:35.696 --> 04:39.449
Nah. I gave 'em the slip.
Used my noggin.

04:39.980 --> 04:42.145
Oh, look at the brain on this guy.

04:42.234 --> 04:45.605
I like it when you're smart.
Now bring her to Papa.

04:45.751 --> 04:49.598
Although...
the smart thing to do

04:49.863 --> 04:54.699
- would be to hang on to it.
- What? What did you just say?

04:54.957 --> 04:58.410
Well, you just said
supervillains make more dough,

04:58.495 --> 05:01.801
and as long as I got the diamond
to put in this glove thing here,

05:01.899 --> 05:04.215
I got superpowers.

05:05.559 --> 05:08.488
What you got is nerve,
Mac-n-cheese!

05:08.559 --> 05:12.230
You're a regular guy
who gets his regular cut!

05:12.367 --> 05:15.652
Well, you think 'cause you can make
snow cones now you deserve the ice?

05:15.710 --> 05:19.191
- You hand over my diamond!
- Oh, I don't think so, boss.

05:19.324 --> 05:21.988
Now pay me what I'm worth,
or else you

05:22.085 --> 05:24.512
and everyone who's
ever underestimated me

05:24.570 --> 05:27.773
is gonna get a cold,
hard wake-up call.

05:28.322 --> 05:32.173
You're not
gonna be worth much dead.

05:32.584 --> 05:36.986
Hey, boys, let's show
"the Snowball" here how it's done.

05:37.477 --> 05:39.820
I warned ya.

05:47.302 --> 05:49.068
- I gotta hand it to ya, Macklin...
- Huh?

05:51.272 --> 05:53.941
Most thugs just say they're
gonna put people on ice.

05:53.999 --> 05:56.191
You actually do it.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.535
The name's not Macklin anymore.

05:59.756 --> 06:01.832
Oh? Let me guess.

06:01.900 --> 06:03.868
"Mr. Zero."
"Fridge Face."

06:04.060 --> 06:06.197
"The Man Who Stole Some Tech
That Didn't Belong To Him

06:06.255 --> 06:08.754
And Now He Thinks
He's A Big Shot" Guy?

06:08.943 --> 06:12.145
Joke all you want.
The name's Blizzard.

06:12.203 --> 06:14.691
Blizzard!
I was so close!

06:14.749 --> 06:17.085
Well, I got news for ya, Blizzard.

06:17.337 --> 06:19.470
It takes more than a name
and some cool tech

06:19.528 --> 06:22.022
to go from being a regular guy
to a super one.

06:22.211 --> 06:24.615
It takes power and responsibility!

06:25.074 --> 06:27.541
Now just give me the gauntlet
before someone else gets hurt.

06:27.670 --> 06:30.654
Let me save you
the suspense, Spider-Man.

06:30.797 --> 06:34.654
Someone is gonna get hurt,
and that someone is you.

06:36.385 --> 06:40.088
Uh-oh. Webs froze.

06:40.155 --> 06:43.873
That's not all that's gonna freeze.

06:45.343 --> 06:47.865
First, your webs.

06:49.879 --> 06:51.580
Then your whole body!

06:51.774 --> 06:53.592
Don't be so dramatic.

06:53.702 --> 06:56.036
I thought snowmen were
happy, jolly souls.

06:58.403 --> 07:01.404
I think I'm getting the hang of this.

07:02.650 --> 07:05.147
Hammerhead
always got my name wrong.

07:05.509 --> 07:08.822
But the world won't.
They'll know me as Blizzard,

07:08.921 --> 07:12.090
the guy who brought
New York City to its knees.

07:12.236 --> 07:15.237
That's a little too much
to put on a business card.

07:15.422 --> 07:17.488
You're right.
Let's shorten it

07:17.592 --> 07:20.277
to "The guy who froze Spider-Man."

07:20.412 --> 07:23.082
- Hey!
- Harry!

07:23.209 --> 07:24.576
That's my gauntlet!

07:24.824 --> 07:28.261
And that's my cue to break
outta here!

07:35.243 --> 07:37.592
Look out!

07:38.845 --> 07:41.180
Y-You're w-w-welcome.

07:43.255 --> 07:46.691
I did it!
I put Spider-Man on ice!

07:46.962 --> 07:50.197
Now let's show the world
what I can do.

07:53.115 --> 07:54.748
No!

07:55.365 --> 07:57.873
S-S-Somehow thought
S-Spider-Man on ice

07:57.931 --> 08:01.373
would involve a lot more
m-m-music and dancing.

08:01.998 --> 08:04.514
Wait!
Where are you going?

08:04.614 --> 08:07.282
- To get my gauntlet back.
- Let me do it.

08:07.450 --> 08:09.560
I'm better equipped than you.

08:10.459 --> 08:12.898
I'm not the one
who got himself frozen in ice.

08:13.020 --> 08:15.170
True. But given enough time,

08:15.301 --> 08:17.998
the heat of my body should melt the ice.

08:18.225 --> 08:21.240
Please!
That'd take forever.

08:21.818 --> 08:26.146
Well, do you have any ideas?
'Cause B-Blizzard is getting away,

08:26.204 --> 08:28.896
and you're not exactly
going for the gold here.

08:29.105 --> 08:33.224
No. But we'd be better off
if I got the silver!

08:35.177 --> 08:38.529
Because silver has the highest
thermal connectivity of any element!

08:38.835 --> 08:40.208
Genius!

08:43.162 --> 08:44.486
What are you doing?

08:44.771 --> 08:47.849
Looking for quarters that
were minted before 1964.

08:47.935 --> 08:50.169
That's the last time they
made them out of silver.

08:50.291 --> 08:52.232
Talk about taking forever.

08:52.290 --> 08:56.420
2010, 1998...

08:56.796 --> 08:58.724
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

08:58.966 --> 09:01.370
Yesss.
I like showing you

09:01.437 --> 09:03.818
that you need us more than
we need you, Spider-Man.

09:03.920 --> 09:05.951
I can't argue with you
at this particular moment,

09:06.009 --> 09:09.240
but right now the Blizzard
needs to be stopped.

09:09.331 --> 09:10.678
So, if you wouldn't mind,

09:10.768 --> 09:12.888
I saw some bags of
jewelry in the corner.

09:12.979 --> 09:15.146
Some of it's got to be silver.

09:15.944 --> 09:18.746
<i>Bags of jewelry, huh?</i>

09:21.583 --> 09:24.646
Gotta say, this isn't
exactly what I expected

09:24.760 --> 09:26.695
in Hammerhead's gangster wardrobe.

09:26.800 --> 09:29.131
Although you do look good in that tiara.

09:30.295 --> 09:32.234
Thanks for thawing me out.

09:32.373 --> 09:34.240
And for not calling me an ice queen.

09:34.435 --> 09:36.662
I know that was
probably hard to resist.

09:37.740 --> 09:41.537
Would be helpful if we could
somehow sustain that fusion process.

09:42.309 --> 09:44.974
Hey, that cryogenic gauntlet you made...

09:45.147 --> 09:47.795
do you think you can make one
that generates heat?

09:47.898 --> 09:49.592
I don't see why not.

09:49.710 --> 09:52.053
I've got the original prototype
back at Oz Academy.

09:52.154 --> 09:54.349
My friend Pete and I made it together.

09:57.951 --> 10:00.514
I'll have him meet me
there, and we'll work on it.

10:01.896 --> 10:03.842
Wait. Do you hear that?
I hear a buzzing.

10:04.066 --> 10:08.604
Huh? Uh, no. I think, uh... pfft...
ice messes with sound.

10:08.671 --> 10:11.824
Shh! There it is again.
Y-You don't hear that?

10:12.075 --> 10:13.589
Nope.

10:13.662 --> 10:16.870
Went to voice mail.
Hey, Pete, it's Harry.

10:17.058 --> 10:18.847
<i>Meet me at Osborne Academy.</i>

10:18.914 --> 10:21.148
<i>Macklin's freezing the city,
and we're gonna stop him.</i>

10:21.215 --> 10:23.584
<i>By turning our cold design
into a hot one.</i>

10:23.651 --> 10:27.723
Oh, boy. Looks like Blizzard
is definitely trying to make his mark.

10:27.790 --> 10:30.123
Won't be so easy
to follow him this time.

10:30.190 --> 10:33.794
Sure, it will. The cryogenic
gauntlet has a GPS built in.

10:33.861 --> 10:36.530
- That's right! It does!
- How do you know?

10:36.597 --> 10:40.436
I-I figure most things
have GPS nowadays, right?

10:40.503 --> 10:43.272
Phones, cars, cryogenic gauntlets...

10:43.339 --> 10:45.539
You, uh... You want a lift
to Osborn Academy?

10:45.606 --> 10:49.699
I'm good. Here. Take this.
It's the GPS tracker.

10:49.801 --> 10:53.637
Thanks. And tell the cops to use
that silver to free Hammerhead's gang!

10:54.949 --> 10:56.855
Pay attention, New York.

10:57.026 --> 11:00.328
The Blizzard is everything
Randy Macklin never was:

11:00.629 --> 11:05.777
- cold, slick, strong...
- Not to mention cracked!

11:11.734 --> 11:15.869
So is that your thing, swinging
in and kicking people midsentence?

11:15.936 --> 11:19.107
'Cause that's the second time
you've done that now.

11:19.269 --> 11:22.168
I like to think my thing is to
bring thugs like you to justice!

11:22.301 --> 11:26.079
I'm not a regular thug.
I'm the Blizzard!

11:28.683 --> 11:31.759
Yeah. I got that.
But guess what?

11:31.977 --> 11:36.313
My forecast says there's gonna
be a blizzard in prison tonight,

11:36.371 --> 11:39.207
with a hundred-percent chance of...

11:39.393 --> 11:41.129
conviction!

11:41.196 --> 11:44.231
<i>When are you gonna realize
that you can't stop me</i>

11:44.298 --> 11:50.070
'cause you can't get near me...
without freezing?

11:52.708 --> 11:57.279
Have to get away from him
if I want my webbing to work.

11:57.346 --> 11:59.780
And insulate myself
to ground the current.

12:06.187 --> 12:08.422
- Stay indoors until it's safe!
- Thanks, Spidey!

12:08.489 --> 12:11.015
Not gonna survive
if I don't winterize my costume.

12:11.265 --> 12:13.531
But Horizon's buried
under snow at this point.

12:13.761 --> 12:17.297
Looks like my only chance is...
Oz Academy.

12:24.421 --> 12:26.808
Whoo.
Hey. Got your message.

12:26.875 --> 12:30.179
- How's the new gauntlet coming?
- Almost done.

12:30.813 --> 12:34.149
And how is it Oscorp is the
only building not buried in snow?

12:34.304 --> 12:36.218
My dad spared no expense in insulating

12:36.359 --> 12:38.387
the building's exterior
with auto heating units.

12:38.454 --> 12:40.988
It's basically the same
technology behind car seat warmers.

12:41.055 --> 12:43.117
Uh, the man's a genius.

12:44.562 --> 12:47.797
He wasn't genius enough to
create comfy long johns, was he?

12:47.888 --> 12:52.180
- I sure could use a pair.
- No. But I was.

12:52.401 --> 12:55.023
Uh, sort of.
Check my locker.

12:59.172 --> 13:00.411
Huh?

13:00.469 --> 13:02.317
We had an assignment
in Toomes's class

13:02.375 --> 13:04.274
to create a material
that could help firefighters

13:04.331 --> 13:07.461
maintain their normal body
temperature despite outside conditions,

13:07.519 --> 13:10.305
<i>so, uh, I made a few
of those thermo-suits.</i>

13:11.195 --> 13:14.918
The stuff on the table is what I used
to simulate the hot-weather conditions.

13:19.654 --> 13:21.690
Huh? Impressive.

13:21.984 --> 13:25.096
Glad to see the Osborn genius
didn't skip a generation.

13:25.343 --> 13:28.375
Nope.
Like father, like son.

13:30.938 --> 13:32.538
Huh?

13:34.078 --> 13:37.937
These materials are exactly what
I need to winterize my webbing.

13:45.281 --> 13:48.634
Have you been able to convert the
gauntlet's cold signature to a heat one?

13:48.915 --> 13:52.751
And how!
Now check this out.

13:59.154 --> 14:00.754
Whoa!

14:03.071 --> 14:06.985
- Harry, what did you do to it?
- It's our gauntlet tech.

14:07.454 --> 14:10.298
I just made it more...
user friendly.

14:10.431 --> 14:13.446
- You mean you weaponized it.
- Yeah!

14:13.565 --> 14:15.866
That's what the Blizzard
did with our original gauntlet,

14:15.924 --> 14:20.288
so why not fight fire with fire?
Or... ice with fire?

14:20.532 --> 14:24.758
Harry, we created the original to
help people, not potentially hurt them.

14:25.079 --> 14:28.181
They're not gonna get hurt.
They're gonna be saved.

14:29.264 --> 14:31.931
Look how awesome this is.

14:34.095 --> 14:36.038
Harry, as co-creator of that tech,

14:36.181 --> 14:38.282
I can't allow you to use it like that.

14:38.595 --> 14:40.548
Wow.
What are you, my dad?

14:40.720 --> 14:43.634
All anybody wants to do is
stop me from using what I make.

14:43.698 --> 14:46.141
I'm not trying
to be like your dad. I...

14:46.509 --> 14:49.641
I'm just trying to restore
the integrity of our project.

14:49.782 --> 14:52.556
Please, Harry.
Rethink this.

14:57.938 --> 14:59.575
Fine!

15:03.137 --> 15:06.145
Look, I'm not saying you can't...
Hmm?

15:08.652 --> 15:11.254
This storm's getting worse.

15:11.543 --> 15:13.863
I should go check on Aunt May.

15:14.223 --> 15:17.035
Let me know when
you've restored the gauntlet.

15:27.051 --> 15:29.191
I hated to discourage Harry like that,

15:29.371 --> 15:32.887
but if that flaming sword ever got in
the wrong hands, it could be trouble.

15:33.902 --> 15:37.113
Luckily, no one's getting their hands
on these awesome thermals.

15:37.218 --> 15:39.754
Mm! Toasty!

15:42.754 --> 15:46.465
- Hands where we can see 'em!
- Aw, you didn't say "freeze."

15:46.728 --> 15:49.096
I was counting on you
saying "freeze."

15:49.344 --> 15:52.445
Ehh, now, what were some of
my other comebacks? Let's see.

15:52.503 --> 15:55.559
"Freeze"...
"Gonna put you on ice"...

15:55.746 --> 15:58.176
Ah, yes!
The boys in blue.

15:58.341 --> 16:02.567
Let's see how you feel when
your faces match your uniforms.

16:04.184 --> 16:08.165
Sorry I'm late, boys.
There was traffic on the... freezeway.

16:08.340 --> 16:09.786
Would you look at that?

16:09.844 --> 16:11.844
You're right.
That is my thing.

16:11.999 --> 16:16.138
- I do like to kick people midsentence.
- Spider-Man,

16:16.473 --> 16:19.035
how are you surviving
these temperatures?

16:19.418 --> 16:22.613
Oh, I just got way hotter,
if I do say so myself.

16:22.858 --> 16:25.848
Check out these thermal webs, baby.

16:31.027 --> 16:32.654
They're red hot.

16:32.721 --> 16:35.455
And you should see me
write my name in the snow.

16:41.837 --> 16:46.306
You fool!
You think thermal webs will help?

17:00.481 --> 17:03.551
It's time for you to chill out!

17:03.618 --> 17:07.487
- You're outclassed.
- But not outsized.

17:12.260 --> 17:15.825
<i>Time to face the cold,
hard facts, Spider-Man.</i>

17:15.929 --> 17:17.632
<i>You're going down!</i>

17:17.839 --> 17:21.329
Did anyone else feel a chill
run down their spine?

17:26.290 --> 17:28.291
Look, Blizzard,
everyone loves a snow day,

17:28.429 --> 17:31.426
but this is getting way out of hand!

17:32.122 --> 17:35.694
- Back off, Blizzard!
<i>- Huh?</i>

17:35.918 --> 17:39.075
- Harry! What are you doing?
- Making a difference.

17:39.220 --> 17:41.723
Get out of here.
This is no place for you.

17:41.936 --> 17:44.590
He's just a regular guy who's
making his mark with some tech.

17:44.710 --> 17:47.379
My tech!
Now I'm gonna do the same.

17:52.566 --> 17:54.301
Harry!

18:09.417 --> 18:12.175
Officer, get this guy to safety.

18:13.287 --> 18:17.390
- Well, what are you gonna do?
- Create some freezer burn.

18:25.749 --> 18:28.241
Can't hide in there, Blizzard.

18:34.215 --> 18:35.726
Or should I say...

18:38.249 --> 18:40.296
"Macklin"?

18:40.670 --> 18:43.862
No! No! No!

18:43.943 --> 18:47.854
I'm more than this!
I'm more than just Macklin!

18:50.565 --> 18:53.831
Really? 'Cause it looks like
you're back to being a common thug.

18:53.889 --> 18:57.659
Funny how when you put a lot of
pressure on carbon, it becomes a diamond.

18:57.820 --> 19:00.688
But when you put a lot of
pressure on a regular person,

19:00.786 --> 19:02.886
some of them just crack.

19:07.008 --> 19:08.839
<i>More ice?</i>

19:09.221 --> 19:12.136
There's plenty
where that came from.

19:12.948 --> 19:17.300
- How's it feel?
- It hurts.

19:18.182 --> 19:22.229
- It'll heal.
- I meant my ego.

19:22.456 --> 19:25.792
Why can't I ever create
anything that I get to use?

19:25.964 --> 19:28.264
I mean, first my dad
sidelines my projects,

19:28.355 --> 19:31.662
and now Blizzard and Spider-Man
steal my thunder.

19:32.400 --> 19:37.003
- Harry, your invention saved the day.
- No, Spider-Man saved the day.

19:37.987 --> 19:40.339
I guess I just wanted
a moment like you had

19:40.508 --> 19:42.508
when you stopped Macklin this morning.

19:42.709 --> 19:44.487
That's what this is about?

19:44.611 --> 19:49.221
Harry, that was... chance.
What you have is intelligence.

19:49.413 --> 19:52.300
And I know that if you keep
creating things to help people,

19:52.440 --> 19:57.245
then chances are...
you'll have your moment too.

19:59.900 --> 20:01.878
It was pretty cool, wasn't it?

20:02.104 --> 20:04.438
Harry, it was 30 below out there.

20:04.631 --> 20:07.003
Everything in this city was cool.

20:09.904 --> 20:12.104
You're the worst.

20:20.236 --> 20:22.673
Can I help you, young man?

20:22.801 --> 20:25.518
Yeah.
I don't know if you heard,

20:25.576 --> 20:27.792
but I was the guy
who stopped the burglar

20:27.850 --> 20:29.596
that robbed this place yesterday,

20:29.659 --> 20:33.448
and so I thought...
I'd return this.

20:34.401 --> 20:38.532
- Our fake display diamond?
- Fake what now?

20:38.599 --> 20:41.737
Yes. It's cubic zirconia.

20:41.847 --> 20:45.112
We wouldn't keep a diamond
that valuable in the window.

20:45.320 --> 20:48.487
Oh.
So I didn't really do anything?

20:48.643 --> 20:52.879
Oh, well, I wouldn't say that.
You did interrupt my lunch.

20:53.245 --> 20:55.440
Would you mind if I keep this then?

20:56.358 --> 20:59.526
What do you want with
an ordinary piece of glass?

20:59.819 --> 21:01.815
Don't underestimate "ordinary."

21:02.016 --> 21:06.351
Under the right circumstances,
it can do extraordinary things.

21:10.494 --> 21:11.573
Phew!

21:11.702 --> 21:14.432
Never thought I'd be happy
to feel this heat wave again.

21:14.557 --> 21:17.979
Guess it goes to show
you that even life runs hot and cold.

21:18.037 --> 21:23.275
Best you can do...
is be prepared.

21:24.689 --> 21:29.453
And today, wearing shorts
definitely helps. Huh!
