WEBVTT

00:00.607 --> 00:05.076
I would like to ask you to
help me obtain a diaphragm.

00:05.111 --> 00:07.471
Is this what the Shearer woman
wanted to speak to you about?

00:07.495 --> 00:08.747
I suppose I'd need two...

00:08.781 --> 00:10.715
one for her and one for me.

00:10.749 --> 00:13.030
This little shit is sneaking
around where he don't belong.

00:13.054 --> 00:14.418
Dad! You're drunk.

00:14.453 --> 00:15.720
Let go of him right now.

00:15.754 --> 00:18.157
- Or what?
- Or I'll kill you.

00:18.191 --> 00:20.226
(John): - There's a new face.
- He's my muscle.

00:20.260 --> 00:23.195
- What's in the case?
- Irons.

00:23.230 --> 00:25.331
George Remus,
you're under arrest

00:25.365 --> 00:26.865
for violating the Volstead Act.

00:26.899 --> 00:29.101
You can't do this.
Remus has paid!

00:29.135 --> 00:31.504
- Remus kept receipts!
- What receipts?

00:31.538 --> 00:34.206
From Jess Smith,
Daugherty's man.

00:34.241 --> 00:36.342
- You came.
- Didn't I say I would?

00:36.376 --> 00:39.079
( Crowd cheering )

00:41.783 --> 00:44.084
- Aquavit.
- We're not supposed to drink any...

00:44.119 --> 00:47.521
Not to drink, to sell.

00:47.555 --> 00:49.416
Sell where?

00:49.440 --> 00:51.324
On Kedzie Boulevard to
Norwegian people there.

00:51.359 --> 00:55.928
- When this is all sorted, you and I...
- Why not now?

00:57.631 --> 01:00.834
We'll go as soon as we're able.

01:00.869 --> 01:04.138
Nucky: Joe Masseria is
backing Gyp Rosetti.

01:04.172 --> 01:07.508
I'm going to fight him.
I need your help.

01:07.543 --> 01:09.477
Everyone here wishes you

01:09.512 --> 01:11.513
all the luck in the world.

01:11.547 --> 01:14.383
Arnold. Arnold.

( band playing, chatter )

02:59.555 --> 03:03.858
Man: To all swimmers,
bathers, sailors,

03:03.892 --> 03:07.494
landlubbers, mermaids,
sea serpents,

03:07.529 --> 03:09.596
and other creatures of the deep,

03:09.630 --> 03:12.966
I, King Neptune,
offer greetings.

03:13.000 --> 03:17.971
As ruler of the Seven Seas,
lord of the boundless waves,

03:18.038 --> 03:21.507
high constable of
the coral caverns

03:21.542 --> 03:23.810
and uttermost recesses
of the depths,

03:23.844 --> 03:28.280
I invite you to feast your
eyes on my spellbinding sirens

03:28.315 --> 03:32.551
and surrender to the allure
of seaside enchantment...

03:32.585 --> 03:34.753
( applause )

03:34.787 --> 03:37.756
to forget about
life's stormy seas,

03:37.790 --> 03:40.826
shipwrecks, and typhoons.

03:43.363 --> 03:46.999
This morning, I unlock
the joys of summer

03:47.033 --> 03:51.003
and invite the denizens of
Atlantic City to frolic

03:51.037 --> 03:54.740
in the spume and bubble
of my watery depths.

03:54.775 --> 03:57.210
( Microphone feedback) (rings )

03:57.244 --> 04:01.347
Neptune: For the next 12
weeks, I command you...

04:01.382 --> 04:04.183
What the heck is this?
Must have fell off a boat.

04:04.251 --> 04:06.553
Whiskey!

04:06.587 --> 04:07.887
Look at this!

04:07.922 --> 04:10.257
Neptune: Forget about
life's stormy seas...

04:10.358 --> 04:13.827
- Man: I can't believe this!
- Whiskey!

04:13.862 --> 04:16.096
Woman: Whiskey!

04:16.130 --> 04:17.863
( People shouting )

04:17.899 --> 04:20.466
Why is everyone yelling?

04:20.502 --> 04:22.502
Maybe it's a sea serpent.

04:22.537 --> 04:24.104
Neptune: and typhoons.

04:24.138 --> 04:26.573
Enjoy the pleasures

04:26.607 --> 04:29.109
of summer and...

04:31.779 --> 04:34.114
Should I continue?

04:34.182 --> 04:39.285
Just blow the fucking trumpets
and leave it at that.

04:39.320 --> 04:42.088
- ( Fanfare plays )
- Very mayoral, Ed.

04:44.892 --> 04:46.593
( Band playing )

04:55.971 --> 04:57.672
Man: Come on, load 'em up.
Let's go.

04:57.706 --> 05:00.842
- Man ♪2: My back is killing me.
- Man ♪3: I got these three.

05:04.447 --> 05:07.248
A dozen fucking crates.

05:07.283 --> 05:09.650
- Two... it was more like two.
- Are you sure?

05:09.685 --> 05:12.353
Why not three? Or fuckin' 12?

05:12.387 --> 05:14.622
Two... it was two dozen, Gyp.

05:14.656 --> 05:16.624
I want to see this
pompinaio captain.

05:16.658 --> 05:18.359
He said it was crazy
out there last night.

05:18.393 --> 05:20.033
The waves were coming
out every which way.

05:20.062 --> 05:22.963
It's a fuckin' ocean, Tonino,
doing what it's supposed to!

05:22.998 --> 05:26.033
- Why the fuck ain't he?
- Man: Could've been rogue waves.

05:27.002 --> 05:28.502
What?

05:28.536 --> 05:30.737
My cousin Franco. He's new.

05:30.772 --> 05:34.507
Whole side of the family
is fuckin' yammerers.

05:34.542 --> 05:37.310
Tell me about these waves.

05:37.344 --> 05:39.879
- Well, a-actually...
- He don't know shit.

05:39.914 --> 05:42.014
Worked on my uncle's
fishing boat

05:42.049 --> 05:44.516
when he was a kid, so
he thinks he knows...

05:46.819 --> 05:48.453
Say what you're gonna say.

05:50.289 --> 05:51.656
Franco: Nothing.

05:51.691 --> 05:54.726
It's just sometimes
when the wind shifts,

05:54.761 --> 05:57.329
waves crash into each other
from different directions.

05:57.363 --> 06:01.831
And when they do, they
make giant waves.

06:01.865 --> 06:05.233
It's easy to lose cargo if
it's not strapped down.

06:08.737 --> 06:10.971
Your father was a
fisherman, huh?

06:11.006 --> 06:12.539
All his life.

06:12.574 --> 06:14.141
Well, how come you
don't know this shit?

06:14.175 --> 06:17.378
- Well, I didn't...
- His father was your uncle, right?

06:18.914 --> 06:20.714
Foreman: All right, this
car is all filled up.

06:20.738 --> 06:24.108
- All right. Let it go.
- Man: bring two here.

06:25.955 --> 06:27.857
- ( Bottles rattling )
- Man: Come on.

06:27.891 --> 06:30.996
Foreman: All right, we're gonna
move it out, fellas. Let's go.

06:35.368 --> 06:37.336
Fuckin' Sinbad over here.

06:37.370 --> 06:39.037
( laughter )

06:40.840 --> 06:42.607
( chuckles )

06:48.415 --> 06:52.585
- ( door opens, closes )
- ( bell jingles )

06:54.655 --> 06:58.591
- Good morning, sir.
- No peddlers.

06:58.626 --> 07:02.062
- I'd like a moment...
- Oh, go away. I not buy nothing.

07:03.198 --> 07:04.665
What's your name, friend?

07:04.700 --> 07:07.168
My name is "I Not Buy Nothing."

07:07.202 --> 07:10.738
Not even a taste
of the homeland?

07:15.078 --> 07:16.745
Aquavit.

07:16.779 --> 07:20.049
Perhaps you'd like to
discuss this in back?

07:20.084 --> 07:22.618
This from Norway?

07:22.652 --> 07:25.488
Cicero, but it's made
by a real Norwegian.

07:25.522 --> 07:28.491
- You no sound like you from Norway.
- My wife.

07:28.559 --> 07:30.761
May I?

07:40.772 --> 07:42.339
( Sniffs )

07:44.608 --> 07:46.476
Ah, it's good.

07:47.411 --> 07:49.612
$6 a bottle.

07:53.216 --> 07:56.118
You give four to me, I give 20?

07:57.621 --> 07:59.489
Very well.

08:18.442 --> 08:20.610
You come back later, yeah?

08:20.645 --> 08:24.315
I have more money
and I buy more.

08:24.349 --> 08:26.250
Later, yes.

08:26.285 --> 08:28.852
Thank you.

08:34.659 --> 08:36.294
( Bell jingles )

08:43.135 --> 08:44.869
You did not drink your powder.

08:44.904 --> 08:46.771
Gaston Means.

08:46.806 --> 08:49.041
He is on the line.

08:52.512 --> 08:55.346
I'm not to be disturbed.
Is that clear?

08:55.381 --> 08:57.015
Ja.

09:03.389 --> 09:06.024
Gaston: I'll begin the
discussion, then, shall I?

09:06.058 --> 09:08.360
A certain individual
has manifested

09:08.395 --> 09:10.963
every sign of erratic behavior.

09:10.997 --> 09:13.666
Jess Smith is Harry
Daugherty's problem.

09:13.700 --> 09:16.769
In my estimation, the
attorney general is rather

09:16.804 --> 09:19.572
perfectly suspended between
the bonds of loyalty

09:19.606 --> 09:22.142
and the need for
self-preservation.

09:22.176 --> 09:24.711
- So let the son of a bitch hang there.
- Yes, indeed.

09:24.745 --> 09:27.614
But in the meanwhile,
the likelihood is high

09:27.682 --> 09:30.317
that Jess will say
anything to anybody

09:30.351 --> 09:33.721
regarding everyone
he's ever met.

09:33.755 --> 09:36.357
Such is the nature of hysterics.

09:36.391 --> 09:38.159
( Cat meows )

09:38.193 --> 09:40.428
Your name would be on that list,

09:40.462 --> 09:42.364
as I'm sure you've considered.

09:42.398 --> 09:44.767
So would yours.

09:50.073 --> 09:52.609
- Would it be difficult?
- Mr. Smith?

09:52.643 --> 09:54.210
( Cat purring )

09:54.244 --> 09:56.612
Some finesse would be required.

09:56.647 --> 09:59.516
Fortunately, I have
experience in these matters.

09:59.550 --> 10:01.486
What does that cost?

10:01.554 --> 10:03.622
40,000.

10:05.858 --> 10:08.060
( Cat purring )

10:08.094 --> 10:09.361
Are you there?

10:09.395 --> 10:12.565
There are men who
would do it for $10.

10:12.599 --> 10:15.134
And you're free to hire them.

10:15.169 --> 10:18.905
I hope you don't choose a
surgeon on the same basis.

10:18.939 --> 10:22.742
In both cases the outcome
can be unexpectedly messy.

10:22.776 --> 10:27.080
You'll get paid... when
I see the results.

10:39.160 --> 10:41.395
Why are you leaving so early?

10:41.429 --> 10:44.131
The Thompsons are expecting me.

10:44.165 --> 10:46.433
Margaret, you mean.

10:46.467 --> 10:48.568
I'm not a monkfish, Katy.

10:50.204 --> 10:51.638
I'll not take your bait.

10:51.672 --> 10:54.975
I was just wondering if Mr.
Thompson knows

10:55.009 --> 10:57.243
his wife fancies the help.

10:57.278 --> 11:01.180
We've been through
this at great length.

11:01.215 --> 11:04.917
I heard you the other
day on the phone.

11:04.952 --> 11:08.221
- I'm only doing my job.
- Right.

11:08.255 --> 11:10.556
Maybe she needed your
help removing a pea

11:10.591 --> 11:12.325
from under her mattress.

11:14.495 --> 11:18.898
Stop filling your head
with foolish notions.

11:20.167 --> 11:22.701
Then prove me a fool.

11:28.674 --> 11:31.076
I'd be happy to...

11:33.846 --> 11:35.947
at the altar.

11:36.949 --> 11:38.883
Really?

11:44.990 --> 11:47.025
We'll discuss it later.

11:54.666 --> 11:56.467
( Door closes )

12:01.874 --> 12:03.742
( elevator bell pings )

12:09.248 --> 12:12.350
Margaret: Mr. Sleater,
good morning.

12:12.418 --> 12:13.951
Mrs. Thompson.

12:16.522 --> 12:18.656
Mr. Kessler.

12:21.426 --> 12:25.430
- Is something wrong?
- No, I just...

12:25.464 --> 12:28.133
You come bearing secrets.

12:28.167 --> 12:31.336
Um, nothing as fancy
as that, I'm afraid.

12:32.972 --> 12:34.839
What do you think, Mr. Kessler?

12:34.874 --> 12:38.276
I... I do not understand.

12:38.310 --> 12:42.347
Margaret: Then I suppose
you need to come clean.

12:42.381 --> 12:44.249
( Chuckles )

12:44.283 --> 12:46.284
It's, um...

12:46.318 --> 12:49.420
it's Katy's birthday tomorrow,

12:49.454 --> 12:52.022
and I'll be damned if I
know what to give her.

12:52.057 --> 12:55.025
And truly be damned
I choose wrong.

12:55.961 --> 12:57.695
A woman's touch.

12:57.729 --> 13:00.798
I'm at your mercy, missus.

13:00.832 --> 13:04.768
Well, let's discuss
the possibilities.

13:04.803 --> 13:06.469
You can bring the car around.

13:06.504 --> 13:09.806
- I'll be down shortly.
- Yes, ma'am.

13:21.050 --> 13:23.218
You shouldn't toy with him.

13:23.286 --> 13:24.953
He sees more than you think.

13:24.988 --> 13:28.557
He's only seen us talking.

13:28.591 --> 13:32.394
And soon, he won't
see us at all.

13:35.432 --> 13:40.035
If we botch this,
he'll find out.

13:40.069 --> 13:42.604
Mr. Kessler?

13:42.672 --> 13:44.840
Mr. Thompson.

13:46.242 --> 13:47.976
You'll need to leave first.

13:48.010 --> 13:50.745
- I'll follow after.
- When?

13:50.780 --> 13:53.915
Can't say. Six weeks, a month.

13:53.950 --> 13:55.517
Why so long?

13:55.552 --> 13:57.252
We leave together,
then he knows.

13:57.287 --> 13:59.088
And he won't forget.

13:59.122 --> 14:00.990
And there's no place
far enough then.

14:05.362 --> 14:08.331
What's St. Louis like?

14:13.103 --> 14:15.805
I haven't a clue.

14:15.839 --> 14:17.540
But Emmet's a mate
from years back.

14:17.607 --> 14:20.642
He'll set us on our feet.

14:20.677 --> 14:24.246
And if it doesn't suit us, we'll...
we'll...

14:24.280 --> 14:26.181
We'll live among the Indians.

14:26.216 --> 14:29.585
Aye. Or give it a go at least.

14:29.619 --> 14:31.987
( Seagulls cawing )

14:32.922 --> 14:35.690
And Katy?

14:35.724 --> 14:37.759
I'll leave one morning,

14:37.793 --> 14:39.560
tell her something that
sounds convincing,

14:39.628 --> 14:42.229
and she'll never see me again.

14:47.335 --> 14:52.238
"A man, a plan, a canal...

14:52.272 --> 14:54.507
Panama."

14:54.541 --> 14:56.409
What are you yammering about?

14:56.476 --> 14:58.911
- It's a palindrome.
- A what?

14:58.946 --> 15:02.048
A word or phrase spelled exactly
the same backwards or forwards.

15:02.116 --> 15:03.850
Like "mom."

15:03.884 --> 15:05.285
Or imbecile.

15:05.319 --> 15:08.121
( Snickering )

15:08.155 --> 15:10.155
- Well, no, that's not...
- Where the hell is Owen?

15:10.179 --> 15:12.914
I'll go see.

15:17.632 --> 15:20.335
"A man, a plan"...

15:20.369 --> 15:21.836
what is it?

15:21.870 --> 15:24.405
"A man, a plan, a canal"...

15:24.440 --> 15:26.907
I have a fucking headache!

15:27.842 --> 15:29.543
I'll tell you later.

15:37.219 --> 15:38.986
Sorry I'm late.

15:39.021 --> 15:41.289
Fill him in.

15:41.323 --> 15:43.725
Heard back from my
contact in New York.

15:43.760 --> 15:45.627
Masseria goes to
the Turkish baths

15:45.662 --> 15:48.898
every Thursday, same time every week...
9:00 p.m.

15:48.966 --> 15:50.299
That might work.

15:50.334 --> 15:52.535
Some place on Chrystie Street.

15:52.569 --> 15:54.170
Popular with the locals.

15:54.205 --> 15:56.839
Steamy, dark, people distracted.

15:56.874 --> 15:58.708
Come up from behind,
nice and quiet.

15:58.742 --> 16:00.143
They got the mineral baths?

16:00.177 --> 16:01.878
Is that fucking important?

16:03.514 --> 16:05.481
He's keeping tabs on
Masseria all day.

16:05.515 --> 16:07.183
I'll go with you as backup.

16:07.217 --> 16:09.385
No, you won't. You're
going to Chicago.

16:09.419 --> 16:10.787
What the hell's in Chicago?

16:10.821 --> 16:13.023
Johnny Torrio and,
with any luck,

16:13.124 --> 16:14.891
an army of men
who'll help us out.

16:14.926 --> 16:17.728
With Masseria gone,
we'll take Rosetti out.

16:17.762 --> 16:20.497
He'll be weak without
Masseria's backing.

16:20.531 --> 16:22.999
So all that extra muscle
will fall by the wayside.

16:23.034 --> 16:26.469
- Rats leaving a sinking ship.
- Nucky: We'll still need help.

16:26.504 --> 16:28.372
You pack your bags, too.

16:28.406 --> 16:30.340
Tell me I'm going to Paris.

16:30.408 --> 16:31.942
( Giggles )

16:31.976 --> 16:33.543
West Overton, Pennsylvania.

16:33.611 --> 16:36.246
You'll be met at the station
by a man named Fahey.

16:36.280 --> 16:37.920
He'll take you to the
Overholt Distillery.

16:37.944 --> 16:39.283
Andrew Mellon's place.

16:39.317 --> 16:40.918
What do I do when I get there?

16:40.952 --> 16:42.872
Nucky: Get it up and running
as soon as possible.

16:42.896 --> 16:45.189
We're taking over
Remus' old operation,

16:45.223 --> 16:47.192
using Overholt as a base.

16:47.226 --> 16:50.495
We can export to Chicago or
New York straight from there.

16:50.530 --> 16:52.898
That'd take some
money, won't it?

16:57.303 --> 17:00.004
We'll take the train to New
York, avoid Tabor Heights.

17:00.038 --> 17:01.282
And who else with you?

17:01.306 --> 17:02.666
Owen: Agent Sawicki
will be enough.

17:02.690 --> 17:04.175
Sawicki: I'll flash my badge,

17:04.209 --> 17:05.910
distract Masseria's bodyguard.

17:05.944 --> 17:07.845
And give me time
to do my business.

17:10.082 --> 17:11.816
It's not that I
doubt your ability,

17:11.849 --> 17:14.017
I just saw this as a
bigger operation.

17:14.051 --> 17:16.118
Owen: More men, more
chance for mistakes.

17:16.154 --> 17:17.521
This job doesn't
call for an army,

17:17.555 --> 17:20.657
just patience...
and opportunity.

17:23.328 --> 17:25.996
Don't you have valises to pack?

17:32.404 --> 17:33.871
Booze is our backbone.

17:33.905 --> 17:36.306
But sooner or later,
this mishegoss

17:36.341 --> 17:37.941
will go the way of
the ostrich feather.

17:37.975 --> 17:40.610
Yiddish, Meyer?

17:42.079 --> 17:44.013
I can't think of a
more obvious route

17:44.048 --> 17:46.583
to my acquiescence than
shared commonality.

17:46.617 --> 17:49.685
How about a good idea?

17:49.720 --> 17:53.189
A.R., you're the one who always
said to look where no one else is.

17:53.223 --> 17:55.257
That's what this deal is.

17:56.493 --> 17:58.961
50 pounds of heroin
for 100 grand.

17:58.995 --> 18:01.630
You know what a "shot
to nothing" is?

18:01.665 --> 18:03.933
It's used in snooker.

18:03.967 --> 18:06.702
It's a shot in which a player
attempts a difficult pot,

18:06.736 --> 18:08.604
but with safety in mind,

18:08.638 --> 18:11.206
regardless of his actually
potting anything.

18:11.274 --> 18:12.775
Sounds like nothing
for nothing to me.

18:12.809 --> 18:14.276
On the surface, yes.

18:14.311 --> 18:16.679
But by design, in the
event of his missing,

18:16.713 --> 18:19.014
he leaves his opponent
in a position

18:19.049 --> 18:21.484
of being unable to strike back.

18:22.886 --> 18:24.487
We're on the verge
of a war, Charlie.

18:24.521 --> 18:25.922
You heard it yourself.

18:25.956 --> 18:28.925
Nucky Thompson's about
to move on Joe Masseria.

18:28.959 --> 18:31.528
And until such time as
one of them is dead,

18:31.562 --> 18:34.331
it would be unwise to
venture into any new deals.

18:34.399 --> 18:35.999
What if the deal won't wait?

18:37.435 --> 18:40.004
A deal will always wait.

18:40.039 --> 18:43.341
And a fool will always rush in.

18:45.778 --> 18:47.946
I like the concept, boys,

18:47.981 --> 18:52.051
but the timing leaves
much to be desired.

19:00.795 --> 19:02.962
( Piano music playing )

19:09.369 --> 19:12.405
Hmm, good book.

19:12.439 --> 19:14.741
I enjoyed it myself.

19:16.810 --> 19:18.377
What do you want, Means?

19:18.411 --> 19:20.379
You're in possession
of certain funds...

19:20.447 --> 19:22.682
10,000 in cash if
memory serves...

19:22.716 --> 19:26.753
that you acquired from a previously
unincarcerated George Remus.

19:26.788 --> 19:28.088
So?

19:28.123 --> 19:32.126
Well, I have it on
unimpeachable authority

19:32.161 --> 19:34.895
that those bills are marked.

19:34.930 --> 19:37.698
- What do you mean?
- Traceable, Jess.

19:37.733 --> 19:39.867
The Treasury Department
and its agents.

19:39.902 --> 19:41.969
If they trace those
bills back to you,

19:42.004 --> 19:43.971
then you can bet the
last one your next job

19:44.039 --> 19:47.108
will be making itty-bitty
rocks out of great big ones.

19:47.142 --> 19:49.443
Oh, Jesus Christ.

19:49.511 --> 19:51.512
I knew it. I knew it.

19:51.547 --> 19:53.047
- I told Harry.
- Jess.

19:53.081 --> 19:55.282
It's over. It's fucking over.

19:55.317 --> 19:58.218
Jess, have you spent any of it?

19:58.253 --> 20:00.887
No. It's still in the envelope.

20:00.922 --> 20:04.291
Good. Then all you have
to do is get rid of it.

20:05.693 --> 20:07.427
- Get rid of it?
- Burn it.

20:07.462 --> 20:10.029
It's the safest best. As
soon as humanly possible.

20:10.064 --> 20:12.899
If I were you, I'd take that
cash out to the yard right now

20:12.933 --> 20:16.869
and consign it to
the fires of hell.

20:16.903 --> 20:18.971
Jess.

20:21.241 --> 20:24.410
This is something
you need to do.

20:48.267 --> 20:49.567
What's wrong?

20:49.602 --> 20:53.171
It pains me to bring
you this news.

20:53.206 --> 20:55.340
It's Jess.

21:04.919 --> 21:08.289
- Harry: What the hell is he doing?
- Harry.

21:08.320 --> 21:09.600
Stop him before
someone sees him!

21:09.624 --> 21:11.192
Look, look. Hey, hey.

21:11.226 --> 21:13.261
And what then, huh?

21:13.295 --> 21:16.297
A panicked man drowns both
himself and his savior.

21:16.331 --> 21:21.002
No. You need to keep
yourself afloat.

21:24.273 --> 21:25.841
The other day, I walk
into the bathroom.

21:25.875 --> 21:27.509
He's talking to himself
in the mirror.

21:27.577 --> 21:29.278
The man is ill, Harry.

21:29.312 --> 21:32.247
- In the yard, burning money.
- ( distant bells tolling )

21:34.484 --> 21:38.188
When Judgment Day comes, and
it most assuredly will,

21:38.222 --> 21:41.992
he'll be in a hospital
eating Jell-O.

21:42.026 --> 21:44.595
But you...

21:44.629 --> 21:47.031
you'll be doing hard time.

21:54.239 --> 21:57.342
Our neighbors' dog...
meanest thing on four legs.

21:57.376 --> 21:59.143
Nobody could get near him.

21:59.178 --> 22:03.714
But he sees Jess, and the
tail starts wagging.

22:03.749 --> 22:07.752
I had a dog just
like that as a boy.

22:07.786 --> 22:11.489
Damn near broke my heart
when we had to put him down.

22:16.461 --> 22:19.463
I wouldn't even know who to talk
to about a thing like that.

22:19.498 --> 22:22.833
$40,000, and I promise you

22:22.868 --> 22:25.135
he won't feel a thing.

22:38.682 --> 22:40.883
I'd prefer if you
waited by the car.

22:40.918 --> 22:43.152
I'm supposed to go with
you no matter what.

22:43.187 --> 22:46.188
That might prove
embarrassing for both of us.

22:47.957 --> 22:50.692
I'll keep 10 paces behind you
and wait in the hallway.

22:50.726 --> 22:53.595
That's the best I can do.

22:53.629 --> 22:56.097
Very accommodating.

22:56.132 --> 22:59.100
Sister Agnes: I can imagine
what you're thinking,

22:59.168 --> 23:01.937
but I assure you I'm
only the messenger.

23:01.971 --> 23:04.006
The bishop himself
has determined

23:04.040 --> 23:07.309
that this... experiment
has run its course

23:07.343 --> 23:09.545
and would prefer that the
hospital's resources

23:09.579 --> 23:13.449
be applied to other areas,
effective immediately.

23:13.483 --> 23:15.985
What about the women
who've been coming?

23:16.020 --> 23:18.554
They will have to seek their
information elsewhere.

23:18.589 --> 23:21.457
You needn't bother
with the chairs.

23:21.492 --> 23:24.193
The cleaning staff
will move them out.

23:27.098 --> 23:29.232
I suppose I should say that I...

23:29.266 --> 23:32.635
I found a great deal of
what went on in here

23:32.670 --> 23:36.105
very educational.

23:53.088 --> 23:55.456
I feel like a German spy.

23:56.658 --> 23:58.693
- Are those the dia...
- Shh, shh.

23:58.761 --> 24:00.762
There's one for you and one for Mrs.
Shearer.

24:00.797 --> 24:03.031
You can get it to her yourself.

24:11.040 --> 24:13.475
You're pale. Are you
feeling all right?

24:15.245 --> 24:18.446
Nothing I haven't
been through before.

24:25.889 --> 24:27.890
Um...

24:29.893 --> 24:33.863
this doesn't have to
happen in a hospital.

24:33.898 --> 24:37.467
A storefront, an
upstairs office...

24:37.502 --> 24:39.202
we could say anything
we wanted to there,

24:39.270 --> 24:41.004
anything they needed to know.

24:41.038 --> 24:43.740
That would get you
into trouble here.

24:43.774 --> 24:46.175
Well, maybe this isn't
where I belong.

24:47.578 --> 24:50.079
Your fiancée wouldn't be
very happy about that.

24:50.113 --> 24:51.981
I don't know.

24:52.015 --> 24:56.552
She's, uh, a bit like you,

24:56.620 --> 24:59.855
telling me to put my
money where my mouth is.

25:01.824 --> 25:05.393
Think about what I proposed.

25:05.427 --> 25:08.028
I hate being told
what I can't do.

25:08.063 --> 25:10.397
And the two of us...

25:10.432 --> 25:13.266
I'd say we work
pretty well together.

25:14.602 --> 25:17.104
We did, didn't we?

25:38.425 --> 25:41.961
So tell me about this
dirty wop Rosetti.

25:41.995 --> 25:43.829
What I'm hoping is that

25:43.864 --> 25:47.433
you'll be able to
tell me about him.

25:47.501 --> 25:50.436
I've never met the man.

25:50.471 --> 25:52.639
I know that.

25:52.673 --> 25:55.308
What I want is for you
to go to Tabor Heights,

25:55.342 --> 25:56.843
cut a deal.

25:56.877 --> 25:59.579
Well, that should take
all of 30 seconds.

25:59.680 --> 26:01.648
It'd be worth its
weight in cow shit.

26:01.682 --> 26:05.051
I sense you've dealt with
Italians before, Mr. McCoy.

26:05.086 --> 26:08.922
And only will again because
it's you who's asking.

26:09.957 --> 26:11.791
Agree to anything.

26:11.826 --> 26:13.927
What I need is information...

26:13.961 --> 26:16.062
the number of men, boats,

26:16.097 --> 26:17.564
where they get their
suits pressed,

26:17.598 --> 26:19.799
how they take their coffee.

26:25.739 --> 26:29.175
What's the difference between
a catfish and an Italian?

26:29.209 --> 26:30.676
What?

26:30.711 --> 26:32.812
One's a filthy,
scum-sucking bottom-feeder

26:32.846 --> 26:35.514
and the other is a fish.

26:36.650 --> 26:38.384
I'll get up there tout suite.

26:38.418 --> 26:40.753
Thanks for the drink.

26:48.497 --> 26:51.533
( Music playing, chatter )

26:52.735 --> 26:55.069
( doorbell jingles )

27:03.345 --> 27:04.945
You come back now, yeah?

27:04.980 --> 27:07.147
Yes.

27:07.181 --> 27:08.715
Good afternoon.

27:08.750 --> 27:14.186
At lunchtime I surprise my
customers with aquavit.

27:14.221 --> 27:16.589
Very happy to drink.

27:16.623 --> 27:19.125
I'm glad to hear that.

27:19.159 --> 27:21.293
- What is?
- For you.

27:24.398 --> 27:26.565
- Ah.
- It's from my wife's oven.

27:26.600 --> 27:28.834
I believe you call it lefse.

27:28.869 --> 27:33.039
Lefse, aquavit...
like I am back home.

27:34.542 --> 27:35.975
I am sorry.

27:36.010 --> 27:38.879
- Beg pardon?
- Call a taxi, mister?

27:38.913 --> 27:40.090
I did not.

27:40.114 --> 27:41.914
We got a car out front
waiting for you anyway.

27:41.938 --> 27:44.106
They did not give me a choice.

27:46.154 --> 27:47.989
Am I under arrest?

28:01.437 --> 28:03.772
It's nice he has his grandma,

28:03.806 --> 28:06.541
but everyone needs a dad,

28:06.575 --> 28:09.878
especially a little boy.

28:09.912 --> 28:12.414
You're right.

28:15.084 --> 28:17.919
It's good he has you.

28:20.322 --> 28:22.623
( Door opens )

28:31.799 --> 28:33.332
No place else to go?

28:33.366 --> 28:36.068
Dad, I invited Richard over.

28:36.103 --> 28:38.738
You sniffing around
here like a dog?

28:38.772 --> 28:40.139
I'll go get you some coffee.

28:40.173 --> 28:42.442
I don't want any fuckin' coffee!

28:44.044 --> 28:46.746
You know why he's here, don't you?
Huh?

28:46.781 --> 28:50.650
You strutting around like
some mongrel bitch in heat.

28:50.718 --> 28:52.319
Richard.

28:52.353 --> 28:54.654
- Dad, stop.
- Shut up!

28:54.689 --> 28:56.223
I'm still your father.

28:56.257 --> 28:59.427
And I won't have you spreading
your legs for some sideshow freak.

29:01.597 --> 29:03.565
Julia: No!

29:03.599 --> 29:05.300
Stop it!

29:06.636 --> 29:08.170
Stop!

29:08.205 --> 29:11.440
Would you pay a
dime to see this?

29:12.843 --> 29:14.677
- Get off me!
- Richard.

29:14.712 --> 29:17.146
- Apologize.
- Fuck you!

29:17.181 --> 29:18.848
Richard, please.

29:18.916 --> 29:21.350
Apologize.

29:23.987 --> 29:25.521
( Choking ) I'm sorry.

29:25.556 --> 29:27.457
To her.

29:40.872 --> 29:43.306
( Gasps )

29:43.374 --> 29:45.306
( coughing )

29:45.374 --> 29:48.476
( clock chiming )

29:58.384 --> 30:02.353
( bell tolling )

30:04.856 --> 30:06.496
Lucky: The money's just
to get us started.

30:06.520 --> 30:08.725
Meyer and me, we'll take care
of everything after that.

30:08.759 --> 30:11.527
All you gotta do is
sit back and collect.

30:15.667 --> 30:17.799
-

30:18.000 --> 30:20.068
It's what I say.

30:39.621 --> 30:42.689
- Bom bom bom.
- ( chuckles )

30:52.732 --> 30:54.399
That's bullshit.

30:54.433 --> 30:57.302
And now you're being rude.

30:57.336 --> 31:00.371
English, so my
partner understands.

31:01.307 --> 31:03.875
You want English?

31:03.909 --> 31:05.844
Fine.

31:08.414 --> 31:12.518
If this such a good deal,
why you come to me, huh?

31:12.553 --> 31:15.087
Why you don't go to
your socio in affari...

31:15.122 --> 31:17.557
the other Jew, Rothstein?

31:17.624 --> 31:20.126
Mr. Rothstein has reservations

31:20.161 --> 31:21.594
about entering the heroin trade,

31:21.629 --> 31:24.731
more than likely because
his business is suffering.

31:25.833 --> 31:29.001
I got reservations, too...

31:29.035 --> 31:31.770
like I no trust you.

31:32.972 --> 31:35.040
This is a big step
for all of us.

31:35.074 --> 31:38.410
We're confident that
time and familiarity

31:38.445 --> 31:40.779
will change all that.

31:41.848 --> 31:44.583
I no be so sure.

31:46.186 --> 31:48.354
Mr. Rothstein's hesitancy

31:48.389 --> 31:50.323
coupled with our
narrow time frame

31:50.358 --> 31:54.461
make it necessary for us to
expand our search for a partner.

31:54.495 --> 31:56.062
Naturally, we thought of you.

31:57.198 --> 31:58.831
Naturally.

31:58.866 --> 32:01.100
100,000.

32:03.804 --> 32:06.940
What else do I get
besides a profit?

32:06.974 --> 32:09.376
Nucky Thompson.

32:09.410 --> 32:11.478
He's thinking about
making a move.

32:12.347 --> 32:14.481
Make a move on me?

32:17.085 --> 32:19.587
How you know this?

32:21.324 --> 32:23.425
Do we have a deal or no?

32:26.830 --> 32:31.134
Without friends who can
provide you with information,

32:31.168 --> 32:34.170
how long do you think
your luck will hold out?

32:37.841 --> 32:40.143
Fine.

32:40.177 --> 32:42.311
We have deal.

32:44.081 --> 32:45.915
You tell me, then,

32:45.949 --> 32:50.120
what information you got
about Nucky Thompson.

32:52.256 --> 32:54.524
( "Westminster
Quarters" playing )

32:54.558 --> 32:58.395
Gyp: We meet here tonight.

32:58.429 --> 33:00.096
Bill: 1,200 cases?

33:00.131 --> 33:02.666
That's bigger than
Nucky's order.

33:02.700 --> 33:04.834
Everything of mine is
bigger than Nucky's.

33:04.869 --> 33:07.637
It's a lot of trips back
and forth to Rum Row.

33:07.671 --> 33:10.539
- You got an army?
- With 17 boats?

33:10.574 --> 33:12.474
More like a navy.

33:12.509 --> 33:14.309
You'll have no problems.

33:14.344 --> 33:16.512
Unless you run into one
of them rogue waves.

33:20.116 --> 33:21.684
How's that?

33:23.086 --> 33:25.788
My cousin Franco
grew up on boats.

33:25.822 --> 33:28.024
The last captain lost
part of our shipment.

33:28.058 --> 33:31.294
Franco said because
of rogue waves.

33:31.328 --> 33:33.596
Well, yeah. At least that's
what it sounded like.

33:33.630 --> 33:35.932
A shitty sailor, this guy.

33:35.966 --> 33:38.067
More than likely
half in the bag.

33:38.101 --> 33:40.170
I don't think so.

33:41.572 --> 33:44.342
Oh, you don't?

33:49.115 --> 33:50.949
Your boy's right.

33:51.017 --> 33:52.657
When the winds shift
like the other night,

33:52.681 --> 33:55.221
the sea can pretty much
have its way with you,

33:55.255 --> 33:58.258
especially if you're busy
stirring up the fuckin' stars.

34:02.998 --> 34:05.532
The fuck do I know?

34:07.069 --> 34:10.070
My father laid
bricks for a living.

34:10.105 --> 34:12.706
Not to worry, Mr. Rosetti.

34:12.741 --> 34:15.443
The ocean and I have
an understanding.

34:15.478 --> 34:19.480
You'll get your booze
on time and intact.

34:28.523 --> 34:31.792
( Clock ticking, music playing )

34:31.827 --> 34:33.995
Jess: Sorry about
this morning, Harry.

34:34.029 --> 34:37.164
- It won't happen again.
- ( liquid pouring )

34:37.232 --> 34:40.100
We all go a little
haywire at times.

34:40.134 --> 34:41.768
You don't.

34:41.802 --> 34:43.969
Not even when we were kids.

34:44.004 --> 34:46.473
You knew what to
do, when to do it.

34:48.675 --> 34:51.277
That twister back home...
remember that?

34:51.311 --> 34:54.914
- In '85?
- It was a dark hour, wasn't it?

34:54.947 --> 34:57.549
In the cellar with my folks,

34:57.584 --> 35:00.185
the world being torn to pieces.

35:00.220 --> 35:03.088
Poor Mary Shackelford.

35:03.123 --> 35:04.590
They never even found her.

35:04.624 --> 35:09.361
But what did we all do
the very next morning?

35:11.398 --> 35:12.765
We... we...

35:12.799 --> 35:15.000
We stepped into
the light of day,

35:15.035 --> 35:19.204
picked up the pieces, moved on.

35:21.308 --> 35:23.276
That's right.

35:23.310 --> 35:26.346
I'm thinking maybe
it's time to retire.

35:26.380 --> 35:27.881
Leave Washington?

35:27.915 --> 35:29.683
We're not getting
any younger, Jess.

35:29.717 --> 35:34.521
Fly-fishing, porch-sitting,

35:34.555 --> 35:37.457
lazy days, busy doing nothing.

35:40.995 --> 35:43.029
How does that sound?

35:43.064 --> 35:46.700
I... I don't know what to say.

35:50.538 --> 35:55.242
This... my heart
was never in it.

35:55.276 --> 35:58.912
And as long as we're
being honest,

35:58.946 --> 36:02.214
for a while now
neither was mine.

36:04.584 --> 36:06.886
Now, you finish that chicken,

36:06.920 --> 36:09.187
get some sleep.

36:09.222 --> 36:10.889
It's amazing how much better

36:10.923 --> 36:13.124
a good night's rest
will make you feel.

36:13.159 --> 36:17.762
Margaret: ♪ Still I feel the
thrill of your charms ♪

36:18.731 --> 36:23.568
♪ Lips that once were mine ♪

36:23.602 --> 36:28.406
♪ Tender eyes that shine ♪

36:28.440 --> 36:33.245
♪ They will light
my way tonight ♪

36:33.279 --> 36:39.284
♪ I'll see you in my dreams. ♪

36:42.121 --> 36:43.821
Sleep tight, my darling.

36:43.856 --> 36:45.590
Sing it again, Mama.

36:45.624 --> 36:48.426
And torture the poor mice?

36:49.394 --> 36:51.328
Mom?

36:51.362 --> 36:54.865
How long do we
have to stay here?

37:00.638 --> 37:03.140
Not for much longer.

37:03.174 --> 37:05.943
Soon we'll all leave and...

37:05.978 --> 37:08.379
see what adventures await.

37:08.414 --> 37:12.083
Emily misses our room and
there's no kitchen here.

37:12.117 --> 37:14.919
As soon as they're
done with the repairs

37:14.953 --> 37:17.021
back home.

37:17.055 --> 37:18.756
Everything will be swell then.

37:19.691 --> 37:21.792
Now get to sleep.

37:23.527 --> 37:25.562
Good night, dear.

37:28.598 --> 37:30.566
I'll be in later.

37:41.243 --> 37:43.645
( Waves crashing )

37:43.679 --> 37:46.415
Was there anyone waiting?

37:46.449 --> 37:50.151
At home, I mean, after the war?

37:52.621 --> 37:55.423
Jenny Hastings.

37:55.457 --> 37:58.593
We rode horses together.

38:00.061 --> 38:02.329
She'd write,

38:02.363 --> 38:05.198
knit me a scarf.

38:05.232 --> 38:09.069
Married my cousin
when I was in France.

38:15.809 --> 38:18.378
I was 20.

38:18.412 --> 38:20.480
He was 32.

38:20.514 --> 38:23.617
A widower with three children.

38:23.685 --> 38:26.253
We talked of marriage.

38:26.288 --> 38:30.257
And then my brother
Freddy was killed,

38:30.292 --> 38:32.726
and my dad...

38:36.932 --> 38:41.236
Well, Douglas...

38:41.270 --> 38:43.805
that was his name...

38:43.840 --> 38:45.473
he married the daughter

38:45.507 --> 38:48.844
of the man who ran the
telegraph office.

38:50.046 --> 38:52.514
Had three more children.

38:59.456 --> 39:02.358
I wish I could kiss you.

39:34.524 --> 39:37.593
( Music playing )

39:39.029 --> 39:41.864
( knocking at door )

39:44.367 --> 39:46.769
- Owen?
- Chalky.

39:46.803 --> 39:48.370
In the foyer.

40:01.118 --> 40:04.421
- ( Door closes )
- Know who I am tonight?

40:04.455 --> 40:07.257
What's that supposed to mean?

40:07.292 --> 40:09.326
Had some trouble last time.

40:09.361 --> 40:12.229
What do you want, Chalky?

40:15.567 --> 40:18.535
Got cash behind me.

40:20.038 --> 40:21.638
I'm gonna cut you proper.

40:21.672 --> 40:25.441
Connections in the circuit...
New York, Chicago,

40:25.475 --> 40:27.243
St. Louis, Kansas City.

40:27.277 --> 40:29.211
I bring the acts in.
I guarantee it.

40:29.246 --> 40:31.079
I don't know what
you're talking about.

40:31.114 --> 40:35.484
A club... on the boardwalk
where Babette's used to was.

40:35.518 --> 40:36.818
A Negro club?

40:36.853 --> 40:39.188
Black on stage,
white in the house.

40:39.222 --> 40:41.457
They doing it in Harlem.

40:41.491 --> 40:44.293
Packing 'em in till
the small hours.

40:47.631 --> 40:50.467
- This isn't Harlem.
- Ain't Japan neither.

40:50.501 --> 40:53.169
But there a big hole out
there, money to be made.

40:53.204 --> 40:54.904
I know it in my bones, Nucky.

40:54.939 --> 40:56.873
And I is set to do it right.

40:56.907 --> 40:59.476
Ain't gonna be no juke joint
with barrelhouse coming out.

40:59.510 --> 41:02.879
This here gonna be elegant.

41:02.914 --> 41:06.783
Tuxedos and "chandelabras."

41:06.851 --> 41:08.552
Chandeliers.

41:09.954 --> 41:12.422
I ain't got to spell
'em, just pay for 'em.

41:12.457 --> 41:14.425
Nobody want to see
that wreck out there

41:14.459 --> 41:17.195
and nobody wanna be
reminded what happened.

41:17.229 --> 41:20.465
This an opportunity, a
chance for this town...

41:20.499 --> 41:22.834
There's a dividing line.

41:22.869 --> 41:24.936
There's a line and
you know that.

41:24.971 --> 41:27.706
That line can move.

41:30.244 --> 41:33.579
Chalky, I have other things
on my mind right now.

41:33.614 --> 41:35.849
All you gotta do is say yes.

41:35.883 --> 41:37.350
I'll take care of the rest.

41:37.384 --> 41:40.119
I just told you how it is.

41:40.153 --> 41:42.154
Why is that hard to understand?

41:54.367 --> 41:56.568
You ain't the only
one be thinking.

42:01.441 --> 42:03.876
- ( Sighs )
- ( door opens, closes )

42:03.910 --> 42:04.924
( piano music playing )

42:04.948 --> 42:07.181
See, I can understand a
fella gets lost once.

42:08.582 --> 42:12.251
Things on his mind, gets
off the wrong L stop.

42:12.286 --> 42:14.020
That can happen.

42:14.054 --> 42:16.389
But twice?

42:16.423 --> 42:19.192
- As I said, sir...
- You're one of O'Banion's.

42:19.226 --> 42:20.793
I barely know the man.

42:20.828 --> 42:23.196
That's why youse packing
iron at the yard last week?

42:24.965 --> 42:28.001
Those were unusual
circumstances.

42:28.035 --> 42:29.970
And so are these.

42:30.004 --> 42:32.372
He's sending you selling whiskey
where you don't belong.

42:33.374 --> 42:36.676
He... he doesn't know, sir.

42:36.711 --> 42:38.111
How's that?

42:38.146 --> 42:40.147
Mr. O'Banion,

42:40.181 --> 42:43.117
he's unaware of my activities.

42:43.184 --> 42:44.651
( laughs )

42:44.686 --> 42:46.921
So what's he like... O'Banion?

42:46.955 --> 42:50.258
Good to work for?

42:50.292 --> 42:52.660
He has his peccadillos.

42:54.097 --> 42:55.897
What's your name again?

42:56.966 --> 42:58.800
George.

43:00.703 --> 43:02.670
What am I gonna do
with you, George?

43:02.705 --> 43:05.239
I got a few ideas.

43:09.011 --> 43:11.546
"There was a man
in the land of Uz"

43:11.614 --> 43:13.047
whose name was Job;

43:13.081 --> 43:15.283
"and that man was
perfect and upright."

43:15.317 --> 43:17.178
- What?
- "And one that feared"

43:17.202 --> 43:19.086
God and eschewed evil."

43:19.120 --> 43:22.456
What the hell are you on about?

43:22.490 --> 43:27.060
Please, sir, I am
providing for a family.

43:27.095 --> 43:30.698
I failed to eschew
evil, but I'm trying.

43:30.732 --> 43:33.701
You tried five blocks
deep into my territory.

43:33.735 --> 43:35.035
- Uh...
- Man: Shh.

43:35.070 --> 43:38.171
Al: Right now you're
gonna pay me back.

43:38.205 --> 43:40.607
- Yes, sir.
- Huh?

43:40.641 --> 43:42.375
Yes, sir.

43:46.947 --> 43:50.182
( Music resumes )

43:50.216 --> 43:53.752
Tell me everything you know
about O'Banion's operation.

44:24.551 --> 44:26.251
Jess! ( laughs )

44:26.286 --> 44:29.555
You're awake at an
unsettled hour.

44:29.589 --> 44:31.390
What are you doing here?

44:31.424 --> 44:33.525
Uh, the attorney general

44:33.593 --> 44:37.229
was detained by the
burdens of state.

44:37.263 --> 44:39.631
Nonetheless, he
expressed concern

44:39.666 --> 44:42.467
- regarding your well-being and...
- You're holding a gun.

44:42.502 --> 44:44.036
( laughing ) Oh, yes.

44:44.070 --> 44:45.704
Yes, indeed, I am.

44:45.739 --> 44:48.541
Uh, I routinely carry a firearm

44:48.575 --> 44:51.110
in the course of my
manifold duties.

44:51.144 --> 44:54.680
"But why... why is it
unsheathed," you may well ask,

44:54.714 --> 44:57.416
"in the confines of the
Park Wardman Hotel?"

44:57.450 --> 45:01.053
- Well, now... now...
- How much is Harry paying you?

45:01.087 --> 45:03.622
- On a weekly basis?
- To murder me.

45:03.657 --> 45:05.758
( laughing ) Oh, now, Jess,

45:05.792 --> 45:09.161
these are the fever dreams
of a restless imagination.

45:09.196 --> 45:13.098
He called you in, he
looked you in the eye...

45:15.334 --> 45:19.270
and he said, "I want you to..."

45:19.338 --> 45:22.207
( sobbing ) Oh, my God.

45:31.217 --> 45:33.985
Would you like me to
put the weapon away?

45:34.020 --> 45:36.389
I'll just, uh...

45:38.325 --> 45:42.796
and then raise my
hands, I guess.

45:42.830 --> 45:45.532
Have you ever killed anyone?

45:45.567 --> 45:50.471
Well, now, Jess, I'll
share a confidence.

45:50.506 --> 45:55.544
I never actually have
brought down the curtain.

45:55.578 --> 45:58.647
That is a hanging
offense, after all.

46:00.016 --> 46:02.985
I'll show you how easy it is.

46:35.919 --> 46:37.620
We want to be private.

46:37.654 --> 46:39.621
And nobody comes in.

46:39.656 --> 46:41.723
( Speaking Italian )

46:41.757 --> 46:44.392
- Sure.
- ( speaking Italian )

46:44.426 --> 46:47.528
( water dripping )

46:59.407 --> 47:01.374
Yeah, let me get two.

47:10.085 --> 47:11.586
( Door opens )

47:11.620 --> 47:13.688
( soft music playing )

47:15.591 --> 47:17.659
( seagulls screeching )

47:19.628 --> 47:21.763
You're sitting in the dark.

47:23.599 --> 47:27.069
Leave it, please.

47:35.278 --> 47:39.349
This craziness should all
be over in a few days.

47:41.919 --> 47:44.154
You don't believe me.

47:45.556 --> 47:47.458
I didn't say anything.

47:49.895 --> 47:52.130
I can't say I blame you,

47:52.164 --> 47:55.533
the way I bollixed everything.

47:55.567 --> 47:57.501
Is that the right word?

47:57.536 --> 47:59.403
Is it bollixed?

47:59.471 --> 48:01.839
You said it correctly

48:01.873 --> 48:05.175
and quite appropriately as well.

48:05.243 --> 48:07.511
I guess between you and Owen,

48:07.545 --> 48:10.247
the old country is
starting to rub off.

48:21.527 --> 48:23.261
I will make this up to you.

48:23.295 --> 48:25.597
I promise.

48:26.799 --> 48:30.203
It's a new start
from here on out.

48:33.474 --> 48:35.842
It is.

48:39.714 --> 48:42.081
You should get some rest.

48:46.086 --> 48:48.721
Gyp: Every bottle
accounted for tonight.

48:48.755 --> 48:53.559
That's 1,200 cases,
24 bottles per.

48:53.594 --> 48:59.265
That's 28,800 bottles.

49:04.205 --> 49:07.439
See? That's math.

49:08.742 --> 49:10.910
That's useful.

49:10.944 --> 49:14.981
That's what my father used
on account he laid bricks.

49:16.216 --> 49:20.386
Built churches, bridges.

49:22.089 --> 49:25.758
Came home at night, he
smelled like sweat,

49:25.793 --> 49:27.893
not fish.

49:29.463 --> 49:33.199
Broke his back, dead at 50.

49:33.266 --> 49:36.668
Layin' around in a fuckin'
boat, he would have seen 100.

49:36.703 --> 49:39.438
But not him.

49:39.472 --> 49:41.940
Not fuckin' him.

49:43.442 --> 49:46.177
Not like your father.

49:46.211 --> 49:50.180
- Right, Franco?
- Please, Mr. Rosetti.

49:50.214 --> 49:52.382
I'm a f... I'm a fuckin' idiot.

49:52.416 --> 49:55.685
I'm sorry. Please.

49:55.752 --> 49:57.520
Tonino!

49:57.554 --> 49:59.155
For the love of Christ!

49:59.189 --> 50:03.059
Gyp, Gyp, he's my
mother's brother's kid.

50:03.094 --> 50:04.894
He didn't mean no disrespect.

50:04.929 --> 50:08.165
He's just a fuckin' know-it-all.

50:08.199 --> 50:11.334
Break his legs, anything.

50:11.369 --> 50:13.170
Not this.

50:15.640 --> 50:17.441
Please.

50:17.475 --> 50:19.476
I'm begging you.

50:19.510 --> 50:22.580
Gyp, he's my blood.

50:34.892 --> 50:37.460
Fuckin' family, right?

50:37.528 --> 50:40.130
Yeah, you know how it is.

50:43.068 --> 50:46.771
Hey, you're a lucky
fella, Franco.

50:46.839 --> 50:49.774
( Crying )

50:51.945 --> 50:54.580
Give me that.

51:04.924 --> 51:07.292
Because I respect you.

51:13.032 --> 51:14.465
Ah!

51:14.500 --> 51:15.667
( Bangs )

51:15.701 --> 51:17.102
Fuck!

51:19.906 --> 51:23.408
( Blows landing, Gyp shouting )

51:26.011 --> 51:29.080
( panting )

51:31.650 --> 51:33.785
Whoo!

51:49.735 --> 51:51.903
You owe me.

52:01.582 --> 52:03.617
( Footsteps approach )

52:08.390 --> 52:10.124
Eddie: Nucky.

52:10.192 --> 52:13.061
Nucky.

52:13.095 --> 52:14.729
What the fuck do you want?

52:14.763 --> 52:17.398
There is a delivery.

52:20.969 --> 52:24.405
- What time is it?
- Almost 4:00 a.m.

52:34.750 --> 52:36.617
What's going on?

52:36.651 --> 52:39.420
- Nucky: Go back to bed.
- What's this?

52:49.096 --> 52:51.931
Get back in your room.
Close it up.

52:51.999 --> 52:53.966
Close it! Close it!

52:54.000 --> 52:57.536
- Nucky: Margaret, don't...
- ( sobbing ) No!

53:19.427 --> 53:21.561
Stop it, stop it.

53:21.596 --> 53:24.264
Stop. Stop.

53:24.298 --> 53:26.533
Margaret, stop, stop.

53:32.941 --> 53:34.775
( Sobbing continues )

53:42.585 --> 53:44.653
( seagulls screeching )

54:20.023 --> 54:23.225
- ( knocking )
- Nucky: Margaret?

54:24.427 --> 54:25.961
Margaret?

54:25.996 --> 54:29.565
Margaret, open the door.

54:29.599 --> 54:31.201
( Knocking )

54:31.235 --> 54:33.770
Margaret?

54:33.804 --> 54:36.906
( Knocking ) Margaret?

54:36.941 --> 54:39.742
( Sobbing )

54:40.944 --> 54:42.778
Margaret's voice: What's St.
Louis like?

54:42.812 --> 54:44.479
Owen's voice: I haven't a clue.

54:44.514 --> 54:46.581
But Emmet's a mate
from years back.

54:46.616 --> 54:48.483
He'll set us on our feet.

54:48.518 --> 54:52.520
And if it doesn't
suit us, we'll...

54:52.555 --> 54:55.056
We'll live among the Indians.

54:55.124 --> 54:58.659
Aye. Or give it a go at least.

55:00.062 --> 55:01.596
And Katy?

55:03.132 --> 55:05.366
I'll leave one morning,

55:05.401 --> 55:07.068
tell her something that
sounds convincing,

55:07.103 --> 55:09.504
and she'll never see me again.

55:12.776 --> 55:16.745
Are you lying to me now?

55:19.683 --> 55:22.452
Why are you asking that?

55:22.486 --> 55:25.521
Because I need to know.

55:25.556 --> 55:27.857
You don't trust me?

55:29.593 --> 55:32.395
Tell me you're
different from him.

55:34.431 --> 55:36.866
Those would just be words.

55:38.135 --> 55:41.637
Then what do I have to go on?

55:52.247 --> 55:54.782
I'm pregnant.

55:54.816 --> 55:57.351
It's yours.

55:59.821 --> 56:01.989
You can do as you choose.

56:02.023 --> 56:05.326
Plans or no, I won't
hold you to them.

56:05.360 --> 56:10.730
But say what you want,

56:10.798 --> 56:14.467
as long as it's the truth.

56:15.669 --> 56:17.403
The truth?

56:20.007 --> 56:23.009
Well, I'd like it to be a boy.

56:30.318 --> 56:31.985
( Door opens )

56:35.923 --> 56:38.292
Nucky's looking for you.

56:44.567 --> 56:46.568
Mrs. Thompson.

56:47.937 --> 56:50.071
Mr. Sleater.

56:55.277 --> 56:57.812
