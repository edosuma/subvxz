Hopefully no one else is up.

I was ice-skating and I got
attacked by a giant beaver.

03:53.776 --> 03:55.444
-No injuries.
-Oh, thank God.

03:55.486 --> 03:57.279

04:02.201 --> 04:04.119
You always walk around

04:04.161 --> 04:05.746
Here's some soup. Sip it slow.

04:05.788 --> 04:07.373
You've got to get
your strength back.

04:07.414 --> 04:09.625
Yeah, well, lentil's not
my favorite, but sure.

04:09.667 --> 04:11.251
-(radio static)
-It's the other teams.

04:11.293 --> 04:14.296

04:14.338 --> 04:16.590
Uh, hey, teams.

04:16.632 --> 04:19.510
It was all a bit harrowing,
but I'm okay.

04:19.551 --> 04:23.138
Nothing injured but my pride
and, uh, a little bit my elbow.

Always happy to help.

04:33.190 --> 04:36.193
So you missed some excitement
at Polynesian night.

04:36.235 --> 04:37.695
Oh, yeah? What happened?

04:37.736 --> 04:40.197
Fran Zimmerman knocked over
a can of Sterno

04:40.239 --> 04:41.991
and lit her grass skirt on fire.

04:42.032 --> 04:44.118
It took nine coconuts
to put her out.

04:44.159 --> 04:45.744
Wow.

04:45.786 --> 04:47.413
Anything wrong?

04:47.454 --> 04:50.541
No, just...
Have you seen Papa today?

04:50.582 --> 04:53.168
No. He came in very late from
wherever he was last night,

04:53.210 --> 04:55.254
and was asleep
when I got up. Why?

04:55.295 --> 04:56.755
Hello, all.

04:56.797 --> 04:58.007
-Hi, Mom. (smooches)
-Mmm.

04:58.048 --> 04:59.800
-Midget.
-Morning.

04:59.842 --> 05:01.218
No food for you, Astrid?

05:01.260 --> 05:03.721
Oh, no.
I'm fasting for Tisha B'Av.

05:03.762 --> 05:05.389
Tisha B'Av. Really?

05:05.431 --> 05:07.349
It's considered the saddest day
in Jewish history.

05:07.391 --> 05:08.559
It's got competition.

05:08.600 --> 05:10.102
My fast started at sunset.

05:10.144 --> 05:12.187
That's why you missed me
at Polynesian night.

05:12.229 --> 05:14.189
You weren't at Polynesian night?

05:14.231 --> 05:15.899
Where's Abe?
Working off a hangover?

05:15.941 --> 05:18.152
He'll be here, Moishe.
He's just running a little late.

05:18.193 --> 05:20.571
-(screams)
-Oh, you scared me.

05:20.612 --> 05:22.156
I'm sorry, Shirley.
For a second there I thought

05:22.197 --> 05:24.491
-you were a bear.
-What's wrong with you, honey?

05:24.533 --> 05:27.244
-Besides what we already knew.
-She's fasting, Shirley.

05:27.286 --> 05:29.288
Yeah, that's why I wasn't at
Polynesian night.

05:29.329 --> 05:31.206
You weren't at Polynesian night?

05:31.248 --> 05:33.083
Hey, guys. Okay if I join?

05:33.125 --> 05:34.418
Go ahead, sit.

05:34.460 --> 05:37.254
-Is it okay, Noah?
-It's a free country.

05:37.296 --> 05:39.256
ROSE: I don't know
what's keeping Abe.

05:39.298 --> 05:41.383
-He's usually up so early.
-MOISHE: Right.

05:41.425 --> 05:44.261
Running around in that funny
little romper of his.

05:44.303 --> 05:46.305
-His what?
-SHIRLEY: (laughs)
Rosie, don't play dumb.

05:46.346 --> 05:49.266
We've all seen Abe in his
little romper; it's hysterical.

05:49.308 --> 05:51.101
MOISHE:
And so formfitting.

05:51.143 --> 05:53.604
Every cut of the mohel's knife
on vivid display.

05:53.645 --> 05:54.605
Please don't let him hear you

05:54.646 --> 05:56.482
talking about his romper,
Moishe.

05:56.523 --> 05:59.193
-You're not eating, Astrid?
-No, I'm not.

05:59.234 --> 06:02.154
-I'm fasting for Tisha B'Av.
-What's that again?

06:02.196 --> 06:04.656
It's a day in remembrance of
the destruction of the First

06:04.698 --> 06:06.909
and Second Temples, but I guess
no one else gives a shit.

06:06.950 --> 06:08.160
-Astrid.
-Sorry. Sorry.

06:08.202 --> 06:09.453
Ah, no, I'm sorry.

06:09.495 --> 06:10.913
Yeah, you've got a lot
to be sorry for, buddy.

06:10.954 --> 06:12.623
Noah, what can I do here, huh?

06:12.664 --> 06:13.957
MIDGE:
Guys, stop.

06:13.999 --> 06:15.501
These were important
fucking temples.

06:15.542 --> 06:17.086
I don't know
what you can do, Joel.

06:17.127 --> 06:18.629
How about invent a time machine?

06:18.670 --> 06:20.589
-Undo what you did.
-Stop, please.

06:20.631 --> 06:22.341
Maybe we should take this away
from the table.

06:22.382 --> 06:24.134
What, so you can beat me up?
No, thanks.

06:24.176 --> 06:26.220
-I couldn't beat you up.
-I'm completely out of shape.

06:26.261 --> 06:27.971
I'm sore from playing
horseshoes.

06:28.013 --> 06:30.641
What are you, competing for the
Biggest Steiner Sissy sash?

06:30.682 --> 06:31.892
Abe.

06:31.934 --> 06:34.478
MOISHE:
There he is, Mr. Sunshine.

06:34.520 --> 06:36.188
Sit down, Abe.

06:36.230 --> 06:37.689
Papa, do you want to sit here?

06:37.731 --> 06:41.985
No, I'm going to sit over here.

06:44.446 --> 06:46.740
Move, move, move, move.

06:46.782 --> 06:49.159
I know that look.
And Abe, I can help.

06:49.201 --> 06:51.370
I've got Ex-Lax back in
the room, boxes of it.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.288
-He eats 'em like candy.
-I don't need a laxative,

06:53.330 --> 06:55.874
Moishe;
I'm very regular, thank you.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.459
Whew. All this talk
is making me hungry.

06:57.501 --> 06:58.710
SAMUEL:
Morning, Mr. Weissman.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.337
I have your tomato juice.

07:00.379 --> 07:02.047
I won't be having any.

07:02.089 --> 07:03.298
Sir?

07:03.340 --> 07:05.008
I won't be having any.

07:05.050 --> 07:06.218
Yes, sir.

07:06.260 --> 07:08.929
He turned down tomato juice.

07:08.971 --> 07:11.473
Are you all right, Abe?
Y-You don't feel warm.

07:11.515 --> 07:13.642
I just don't want a glass
of tomato juice, okay?

07:13.684 --> 07:15.310
Is that such a shock?

07:15.352 --> 07:16.311
MAN (over P.A.):
Attention, Steiner diners.

07:16.353 --> 07:17.604
Good news.

07:17.646 --> 07:19.940
The missing plumber
has been found.

07:19.982 --> 07:21.942
I repeat, the missing plumber
has been found.

07:24.069 --> 07:26.405
So it's a beautiful day outside
and I thought,

07:26.446 --> 07:28.532
why not stay inside and bowl?

07:28.574 --> 07:31.243
-Anyone want to tag along?
-ABE: Bowling?

07:31.285 --> 07:34.997
No, Joel. No one here wants
to go bowling.

07:35.038 --> 07:36.582
I'm missing something.
What's wrong, Abe?

07:36.623 --> 07:38.333
NOAH:
What's wrong? A lot of us

07:38.375 --> 07:40.627
are still processing this thing
you did to my sister, okay?

07:40.669 --> 07:44.506
This isn't about
their breakup, Noah. No.

07:44.548 --> 07:47.259
That was centuries ago.

07:47.301 --> 07:49.344
Many things have happened since.

07:49.386 --> 07:52.097
Many suns have risen

07:52.139 --> 07:55.559
and many have set.

07:55.601 --> 07:57.436
He's lost his mind.

07:57.477 --> 07:59.229
Like he's swallowed Gandhi.

07:59.271 --> 08:00.272
Papa...

08:00.314 --> 08:01.690
Why is everyone
so focused on me?

08:01.732 --> 08:03.442
-MIDGE: Papa...
-I'm trying to eat.

08:03.483 --> 08:04.818
Papa!

08:04.860 --> 08:06.862
Porch.

08:09.698 --> 08:11.658
What is this about?

08:11.700 --> 08:14.328
I probably said something at
some point that put him off.

08:14.369 --> 08:16.330
In fact, I know I did.

08:16.371 --> 08:18.707
I'll fix it. Eat. Eat.

08:18.749 --> 08:20.792
She knows I'm fasting.

08:20.834 --> 08:23.754
Why would she say that?

08:28.717 --> 08:30.344
MIDGE: You must have a lot
of questions.

08:30.385 --> 08:32.221
ABE: You know, I woke up
several times in the night

08:32.262 --> 08:35.098
thinking I'd imagined
what I saw.

08:35.140 --> 08:38.727
Maybe someone slipped something
into my drink. Lysergic acid.

08:38.769 --> 08:41.730
That's a drug
that makes you hallucinate.

08:41.772 --> 08:44.316
See colors, monsters...

08:44.358 --> 08:46.610
Daughters saying horrible things
on a showroom stage

08:46.652 --> 08:48.445
in front of a thousand people.

08:48.487 --> 08:50.364
It's impossible, what I saw.

08:50.405 --> 08:52.282
It's not. You saw it.

08:52.324 --> 08:54.993
It was me.

09:00.707 --> 09:02.084
Is this a hobby?

09:02.125 --> 09:03.585
It's a profession.

09:03.627 --> 09:05.087
And you make money from this?

09:05.128 --> 09:06.505
A little. Not enough.

09:06.546 --> 09:07.839
But that's the plan.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.216
You want to be Milton Berle.

09:09.258 --> 09:10.259
God, no.

09:10.300 --> 09:11.927
Then whom?

09:11.969 --> 09:14.596
I don't know... Me.

09:14.638 --> 09:16.014
You're already you.

09:16.056 --> 09:17.641
It's all me.

09:17.683 --> 09:20.519
And the arrests?

09:20.560 --> 09:23.063
-How did you know about that?
-Never mind how I know.

09:23.105 --> 09:25.774
What did you do
to get arrested? Twice.

09:25.816 --> 09:28.110
They said misdemeanors,
but that could be many things.

09:28.151 --> 09:29.861
-Was it gambling?
-No.

09:29.903 --> 09:31.446
-Did you break in somewhere?
-Yes.

09:31.488 --> 09:33.615
I'm the notorious cat burglar
of the Upper West Side.

09:33.657 --> 09:35.909
-So you won't tell me.
-No.

09:35.951 --> 09:38.954
My God, the first time
we brought you here,

09:38.996 --> 09:41.540
I was carrying you.

09:41.581 --> 09:43.834
-Who was that woman?
-What woman?

09:43.875 --> 09:45.669
The woman with us
in the car last night.

09:45.711 --> 09:47.462
Oh... I'm so used to people
thinking she's a guy,

09:47.504 --> 09:49.131
I didn't know who you were
talking about.

09:49.172 --> 09:51.300
-She's clearly a woman.
-Her name's Susie.

09:51.341 --> 09:52.926
She's my manager.

09:52.968 --> 09:55.470
-She doesn't look professional.
-She's very professional.

09:55.512 --> 09:57.097
Her appearance just doesn't
reflect it yet.

09:57.139 --> 09:59.391
She was carrying
a toilet plunger.

09:59.433 --> 10:01.435
-It's part of her act.
-She's a comedian, too?

10:01.476 --> 10:03.937
No, she's sort of pretending
to be an employee here.

10:03.979 --> 10:05.230
My head is spinning.

10:05.272 --> 10:06.523
Let me get you a tomato juice.

10:06.565 --> 10:08.317
You've ruined tomato juice
for me.

10:08.358 --> 10:09.776
-You don't mean that.
-It's ruined.

10:09.818 --> 10:11.153
Who wants to pick a card?

10:11.194 --> 10:13.530
Get the fuck away from us!

10:19.119 --> 10:20.829
In a way,
I'm glad this happened.

10:20.871 --> 10:22.289
Really?

10:22.331 --> 10:24.291
I want people to know.
Mama should know.

10:24.333 --> 10:26.084
-It's time.
-No.

10:26.126 --> 10:27.627
I don't want to hide it anymore.

10:27.669 --> 10:29.671
I've been trying to find a way
to tell you all.

10:29.713 --> 10:30.964
And what if you don't
stick with it?

10:31.006 --> 10:32.466
Why put her through this tsuris?

10:32.507 --> 10:33.759
I'm sticking with it.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.385
Like you stuck
with your marriage?

10:35.427 --> 10:37.471
That's not fair. Joel left me.

10:37.512 --> 10:38.972
You were going
to get back together.

10:39.014 --> 10:40.432
You made a point of telling me.

10:40.474 --> 10:41.808
We decided not to.

10:41.850 --> 10:43.435
Are you seeing
the flip-flops here?

10:43.477 --> 10:45.771
It was more like he flipped,
I flopped.

10:45.812 --> 10:47.647
Well, I can't keep
falling behind

10:47.689 --> 10:50.400
and playing catch-up
on your life, Miriam.

10:50.442 --> 10:52.277
I need some control over this.

10:52.319 --> 10:55.530
-So what do you want me to do?
-I want you to lie low.

10:55.572 --> 10:57.616
Do not tell your mother
or anyone else

10:57.657 --> 10:59.951
about this absurd thing
you're doing.

10:59.993 --> 11:01.995
I'll let you know
when the time is right.

11:02.037 --> 11:03.705
I'd like to tell her
when we get back to the city.

11:03.747 --> 11:05.248
No, when we get back, we unpack.

11:05.290 --> 11:06.500
We'll unpack either way.

11:06.541 --> 11:08.418
No, if everyone gets distracted,

11:08.460 --> 11:10.504
we won't unpack,
and suitcases and boxes

11:10.545 --> 11:12.589
will be crowding
the place for weeks.

11:12.631 --> 11:15.634
-I can't live like that.
-Fine, then after we unpack.

11:15.675 --> 11:16.676
And get past Hanukkah.

11:16.718 --> 11:19.012
Hanukkah? That's months away.

11:19.054 --> 11:20.597
You want to spoil your mother's
Hanukkah by telling her

11:20.639 --> 11:22.307
you're pursuing a life
as a foul-mouthed comic?

11:22.349 --> 11:25.352
My act's not all foul.
You came on a blue night.

11:25.394 --> 11:27.062
Miriam, you owe me.

11:27.104 --> 11:30.357
Now lay low
and don't tell anyone

11:30.399 --> 11:32.818
until I decide
the time is right.

11:32.859 --> 11:35.987
I. Me. Your father.

11:37.447 --> 11:40.409
All right. I'll lay low.

11:40.450 --> 11:42.661
(sighs)

11:42.702 --> 11:45.163
Now I have to go apologize
to the tumbler.

11:45.205 --> 11:47.666
He's an innocent in all this.

11:52.212 --> 11:55.006
He hit birdies on five
of his last six holes.

11:55.048 --> 11:56.800
-Isn't that somethin'?
-That is somethin'.

11:56.842 --> 11:59.010
-You play golf, Joel.
-Actually, I don't.

11:59.052 --> 12:01.805
And there was this kid, this
19-year-old, Jack Nicklaus.

12:01.847 --> 12:04.516
He's gonna give Arnold Palmer
a run for his money one day.

12:04.558 --> 12:06.518
-But you follow golf.
-Actually, I don't.

12:06.560 --> 12:08.770
I'm gonna get you
on the links this year, buddy.

12:08.812 --> 12:11.523
-Nothing's gonna stop me.
-Marv really wants
to golf with you, Joel.

12:11.565 --> 12:12.816
Excuse me, guys.

12:12.858 --> 12:14.234
Uh, Joel, there's something up
with the kids.

12:14.276 --> 12:16.236
It's time-sensitive.
Will you excuse us?

12:16.278 --> 12:18.238
Of course.
Hope everything's all right.

12:18.280 --> 12:21.324
-Was it Midge who played golf?
-What's wrong with the kids?

12:21.366 --> 12:22.826
Nothing.

12:22.868 --> 12:24.953
I'm buying you an ice cream.

12:24.995 --> 12:27.414
Single vanilla.

12:27.456 --> 12:29.458
So, breakfast was tense.

12:29.499 --> 12:32.377
No, Hiroshima was tense;
breakfast was worse.

12:32.419 --> 12:33.503
What happened?

12:33.545 --> 12:35.672
Papa showed up at the Concord,

12:35.714 --> 12:38.633
and I was... on stage.

12:38.675 --> 12:40.927
-Whoa.
-Yeah. Big whoa.

12:40.969 --> 12:43.763
-When? How?
-I'm not even sure
what brought him there.

12:43.805 --> 12:46.433
Fate. The gods. When I was four,
I took two lollipops

12:46.475 --> 12:49.186
when the rabbi told me to take
one, and this is my punishment?

12:49.227 --> 12:50.687
You want me to talk
to him? I mean,

12:50.729 --> 12:52.689
-we're the only two
who know, right?
-It won't help.

12:52.731 --> 12:53.940
He just needs time.

12:53.982 --> 12:55.150
Thank you.

12:56.193 --> 12:59.029
So, how was the gig?

12:59.070 --> 13:00.739
Oh.

13:00.780 --> 13:02.866
We're having that conversation?

13:02.908 --> 13:05.368
Yeah, we are.

13:05.410 --> 13:06.995
Well, I...

13:07.037 --> 13:09.206
spotted Papa
almost from the get-go,

13:09.247 --> 13:11.249
but I had to keep going.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.251
I... said things,

13:13.293 --> 13:15.253
things I barely remember.

13:15.295 --> 13:17.756
I heard laughs.
Some pretty big laughs.

13:17.797 --> 13:19.841
Kind of wish I was there.

13:19.883 --> 13:21.301
Yeah.

13:22.719 --> 13:24.930
I should go.
Thank you for the ice cream.

13:24.971 --> 13:26.890
Thanks for getting
the Feinburgs off me.

13:26.932 --> 13:29.768
-They should invent
a spray for that.
-Yeah. They should.

13:29.809 --> 13:31.603

13:38.443 --> 13:40.695

13:43.114 --> 13:46.368
There's a couple of spots open;
you can go on in.

13:46.409 --> 13:48.370
Eh, I'm gonna wait.
I've already experienced

13:48.411 --> 13:51.122
a couple of shower mishaps,
and it's best to be safe.

13:51.164 --> 13:52.999
-Mishaps?
-I accidentally walked
into the men's

13:53.041 --> 13:56.086
just as the tummler was
bent over to pick up his soap.

13:56.127 --> 13:58.421
I can't unsee that.
Also, nobody sees this.

13:58.463 --> 14:00.632
I don't ever even look.
So I'm good.

14:00.674 --> 14:02.801
Worked. See you in a bit.

14:02.842 --> 14:04.678
Mm.

14:07.973 --> 14:09.933
-Night, Susie.
-Hello.
-Night, guys.

14:09.975 --> 14:12.644
Gonna be a hot one tomorrow.
Dress accordingly.

14:12.686 --> 14:15.272
-See you, Susie.
-Good night, Susie.
-Good night, Susie.

14:15.313 --> 14:17.107
WOMAN:
Good night, Susie.

14:17.148 --> 14:20.193
-Did she quit? Was she fired?
-Oh! Mystery!

14:20.235 --> 14:22.862
Old lady Steiner did one of her
white-glove inspections today.

14:22.904 --> 14:25.240
-I wish she'd announce those.
-That woman scares me.

14:25.282 --> 14:26.783
She's actually really nice.

14:26.825 --> 14:28.952
She came to visit
when I was in the infirmary.

14:28.994 --> 14:30.662
Oh. Susie,
you can put your ditty bag

14:30.704 --> 14:32.664
in the space under my bed
if you want.

14:32.706 --> 14:34.583
(snickers)
What did you call it?

14:34.624 --> 14:36.543
A ditty bag.
What do you call it?

14:36.585 --> 14:38.295
-My shit.
-(laughter)

14:38.336 --> 14:40.422
Susie, you're a gas!

14:40.463 --> 14:42.841
So, Sally and I saw you talking
to Felix tonight, Laura.

14:42.882 --> 14:45.677
-Oh. Do tell.
-He asked me to pass the salt.

14:45.719 --> 14:48.513
-It was hardly talking.
-We saw you blush
from across the room.

14:48.555 --> 14:50.098
You were redder
than the ketchup.

14:50.140 --> 14:51.391
He is so handsome.

14:51.433 --> 14:53.018
And so single.

14:53.059 --> 14:55.103
You guys are talking
about the same Felix, right?

14:55.145 --> 14:57.397
Teaches ballet? Walks around
in a leotard all day?

14:57.439 --> 14:59.774
-That's him.
-Mm-hmm.
-Guys, you know he's a...

15:01.693 --> 15:03.653
-Never mind.
-WOMAN (over P.A.):
Attention, employees,

15:03.695 --> 15:05.989
it's lights out.
See you tomorrow.

15:06.031 --> 15:07.365
Season's just about over.

15:07.407 --> 15:09.326
It feels like it just started.

15:09.367 --> 15:12.370
-This might be my last stint
in the Catskills.
-Deecy, no!

15:12.412 --> 15:14.080
No, no, it's good.
If the singing career's

15:14.122 --> 15:16.916
gonna happen, I just got
to get out there and do it.

15:16.958 --> 15:19.419
You can totally do it, Deecy.
You've got a fantastic voice.

15:19.461 --> 15:21.046
-Like Rosemary Clooney.
-Better.

15:21.087 --> 15:22.756
I'm gonna be
the next Lucille Ball.

15:22.797 --> 15:24.966
-Oh, no doubt, Sally.
-You're a born comedienne.

15:25.008 --> 15:27.052
And just so you guys know,
when I get famous,

15:27.093 --> 15:28.928
I'm not taking
any of you with me.

15:28.970 --> 15:30.805
-(laughter)
-DEECY: She is so funny.

15:30.847 --> 15:32.098
Look out, Lucille Ball.

15:32.140 --> 15:33.892
-I'm Broadway bound.
-Oh, I saw her do

15:33.933 --> 15:35.769
Doll's House in high school.
She made me cry.

15:35.810 --> 15:38.355
-Your father's
a big producer, right?
-Yeah, but I'm changing

15:38.396 --> 15:40.231
my last name
so that when I make it,

15:40.273 --> 15:41.816
I know I made it on my own.

15:41.858 --> 15:43.360
How about our resident poet?

15:43.401 --> 15:45.070
You're, like,
the next Emily Dickinson, Pearl.

15:45.111 --> 15:47.656
You're all invited
to my Pulitzer ceremony.

15:47.697 --> 15:49.449
(laughter)

15:49.491 --> 15:51.451
You know none of that's
gonna happen, right?

15:54.245 --> 15:55.789
Especially the poet.

16:00.919 --> 16:02.087
Night, everybody.

16:02.128 --> 16:03.755
-Night.
-Yeah.
-Good night.

16:03.797 --> 16:05.882
-Night.
-SUSIE: And whichever one of you

16:05.924 --> 16:08.385
is gonna change
your name, don't.

A reminder that swim trunks

16:12.889 --> 16:15.684
and bathing suits must be worn

even after dark.

16:17.310 --> 16:19.145
If you're afraid, son,
then be so,

16:19.187 --> 16:21.439
because here comes
a classic knockdown,

16:21.481 --> 16:24.776
courtesy of Sir Isaac Newton's
first and second laws of motion.

16:24.818 --> 16:27.112
Okay. But the gravity weight's
changing as it glides.

16:27.153 --> 16:29.239
And the surface of the table
is modulating

16:29.280 --> 16:31.241
with the humidity in the room.

16:31.282 --> 16:33.159

Have fun with that.

16:33.201 --> 16:36.579
Son, be an object in motion,
won't you? Give me my space.

16:36.621 --> 16:38.748
Wimpy Bernstein!
How they hangin'?

16:38.790 --> 16:40.917
A little lower this year,
I think.

16:40.959 --> 16:43.169
How do Jews mark
the passage of time?

16:43.211 --> 16:45.171
We don't count
the rings of a tree.

16:45.213 --> 16:47.215
We mention the distance
from the floor

16:47.257 --> 16:49.008
to Wimpy Bernstein's schnutz!

-Ah-ha-ha-ha!

16:54.389 --> 16:56.683
Oh. Here's the life
of the party.

16:56.725 --> 16:58.685
Hey, Pop.
Pull up a stool.

16:58.727 --> 17:00.687
-Who's your friend?
-Not a friend.

17:00.729 --> 17:02.689
-Could be your friend.
-I'm not disagreeing, Pop.

17:02.731 --> 17:04.274
Come on.

17:04.315 --> 17:06.860
OLIVER:
Phone call! Phone call!

17:06.901 --> 17:10.488
Oh, God, now Moishe's gonna sit
there on the phone and yammer on

17:10.530 --> 17:13.158
-like a complete yutz.
-Phone call for Abe Weissman.

17:13.199 --> 17:15.160
-Oh. It's for me?
-Better get it, Abe.

17:15.201 --> 17:17.287
Could be one or your
egghead professor friends

17:17.328 --> 17:19.873
wondering how to zip his fly.
Isn't that what happens?

17:19.914 --> 17:21.458
You know calculus and physics

17:21.499 --> 17:23.585
but forget how
to put your pants on?

17:23.626 --> 17:25.670
-(Moishe laughing)
-Hello?

17:28.465 --> 17:30.133
What? What?

17:30.175 --> 17:32.552
You're stuck in the dugout,
slugger. Get in there.

17:32.594 --> 17:34.220
-Pop.
-Come on. She's your type:

17:34.262 --> 17:37.515
she's cute, she's quiet,
she knows how to read.

17:37.557 --> 17:40.435
Fine. I'll go where
my matchmaking skills

17:40.477 --> 17:43.062
-are appreciated.
-You do that.

17:45.982 --> 17:47.692
(chuckles softly)

17:51.696 --> 17:54.324
-Anything interesting?
-Not really.

17:54.365 --> 17:56.701
I'm sick of Eddie Fisher.
I'm sick of Elizabeth Taylor.

17:56.743 --> 17:58.953
Pretty soon they'll be sick
of each other, right?

17:58.995 --> 18:01.790
(chuckles)
Here's hoping.

18:01.831 --> 18:03.792
So, I've seen you bowl.

18:03.833 --> 18:05.794
-You're good.
-I'm okay.

18:05.835 --> 18:07.796
No, you're really good,
like a professional.

18:07.837 --> 18:10.715
Well, I'm no Dick Weber,
but I hold my own.

18:12.133 --> 18:13.760
What's with the shooting stars?

18:13.802 --> 18:15.553
There's a meteor shower tonight.

18:15.595 --> 18:17.388
It's supposed to be really neat.

18:17.430 --> 18:19.057
-Are you going?
-Into space?

18:19.098 --> 18:21.184
(laughs)
To the viewing party, silly.

18:21.226 --> 18:23.228
Out on the lawn.
I'm going.

18:23.269 --> 18:25.480
You should go.

18:25.522 --> 18:27.315
Maybe.

18:27.357 --> 18:29.484
Thank you, Franklin.
Thank you so much.

18:29.526 --> 18:31.152
See you soon. Bye.

18:33.029 --> 18:35.073
Okay. Okay,
catching my breath here.

18:35.114 --> 18:37.867
-What is it, Pop?
-That was the director
of Bell Labs

18:37.909 --> 18:40.495
calling to tell me that
they have officially okayed

18:40.537 --> 18:42.997
-the funding for my project.
-Wow, that's huge!

18:43.039 --> 18:44.958
-Congratulations!
-This never happens

18:44.999 --> 18:46.376
after such a short tenure.

18:46.417 --> 18:48.086
It's a giant vote of confidence.

18:48.127 --> 18:50.088
Don't be so surprised, Pop.
You're a big shot.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.757
They want me to come in
to discuss it in person, today.

18:52.799 --> 18:54.551
-They want me there today.
-Well, get going.

18:54.592 --> 18:56.594
Let's see, I've got to get
the car pulled around.

18:56.636 --> 18:59.556
-I should stop home
and put on a suit.
-Got to look your best.

18:59.597 --> 19:02.225
-Hey. Come with me.
-Oh, I don't want to get

19:02.267 --> 19:04.102
-in the way.
-You won't be in the way.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.604
Come. See my office.
See your father the macher.

19:06.646 --> 19:08.147
We'll have dinner after.

19:08.189 --> 19:09.649
-Someplace nice?
-With champagne.

19:09.691 --> 19:11.901
-Let's do it.
-Rose! Rose, I got picked.

19:11.943 --> 19:14.779
My project at Bell Labs
is funded, it's going forward.

19:14.821 --> 19:17.657
-Papa, that's great.
-Oh! Yes, it is.

19:17.699 --> 19:20.118
We're, uh, we're going
to the city, Noah and me.

19:20.159 --> 19:21.995
We'll be back tomorrow morning.

19:22.036 --> 19:24.330
The average IQ of Steiner guests
will drop for a day,

19:24.372 --> 19:27.375
but we'll get by with our brute
strength and street smarts.

19:27.417 --> 19:30.295
We have to leave immediately.

19:30.336 --> 19:32.130
-Go. Go.
-Jimmy! Jimmy!

19:32.171 --> 19:33.756
Where is that boy
when you need him?

19:33.798 --> 19:35.633
-I'm right here, Mr. Weissman.
-SHIRLEY: Mah-jongg.

19:36.926 --> 19:39.137
WOMAN:
That's just not right.

19:39.178 --> 19:41.139
-ROSE: Shirley?
-What?

19:41.180 --> 19:43.057
Have you moved since last night?

19:43.099 --> 19:44.893
-Nope.
-Not even to go to the bathroom?

19:44.934 --> 19:46.561
-Nope.
-Do you think this is wise?

19:46.603 --> 19:49.188
Hey, we're not playing
for 3-In-One Oil here.

19:49.230 --> 19:51.399
This is for money.
Do you understand?

19:51.441 --> 19:54.068
Serious money.
Now go away. Go away!

19:54.110 --> 19:56.070
-WOMAN: Who were they?
-They're nobody. Ignore them.

19:56.112 --> 19:58.031
She's the only person
whose disposition worsens

19:58.072 --> 19:59.949
-in the fresh air.
-Mm-hmm.

20:01.951 --> 20:03.703
(laughs)

20:03.745 --> 20:05.705
-Miriam?
-Hmm?

20:05.747 --> 20:08.166
MAN (over P.A.): Miriam Maisel,
please come to building 15B.

20:08.207 --> 20:11.336
Miriam Maisel,
please come to building 15B.

20:11.377 --> 20:13.087
-Where's that?
-Not sure. I'll go check.

20:13.129 --> 20:14.714
-I'll see you at the cottage.
-Okay.

20:14.756 --> 20:16.716
(bowling pins crashing)

20:19.719 --> 20:21.304
(people singing in distance)

20:21.346 --> 20:23.097
Hey. What's up?

20:23.139 --> 20:24.933
Got some good news, finally.

20:24.974 --> 20:26.935
Hit me with it.
What's going on in there?

20:26.976 --> 20:28.603
Oh, it's rehearsals
for the employee show.

20:28.645 --> 20:30.229
Apparently, it's been
a Steiner Resort tradition

20:30.271 --> 20:31.689
for a thousand years.

20:31.731 --> 20:33.441
Right. They put it on
the last day.

20:33.483 --> 20:35.276
I always have such mixed
feelings about it.

20:35.318 --> 20:37.320
I love the show,
but it means summer's over.

20:37.362 --> 20:39.280
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Listen. One
of the girls in my cabin, Laura?

20:39.322 --> 20:41.157
She comes from a big
New York showbiz family.

20:41.199 --> 20:43.034
I clawed some info
on a contact from her,

20:43.076 --> 20:44.869
and I booked you another gig.

20:44.911 --> 20:46.287
She's even lending me her car.

20:46.329 --> 20:49.123
-Oh.
-What's wrong? That's good.

20:49.165 --> 20:52.377
Well, I kind of told my fath...

20:52.418 --> 20:54.545
Nothing. Let's do it.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.547
Great. Okay, so meet me back
here again tomorrow at 9:00.

20:56.589 --> 20:58.091
-Okay.
-STEVIE: Mrs. Maisel.

20:58.132 --> 21:00.259
Anything I can help you with?

21:00.301 --> 21:02.512
No, Stevie. I'm fine, thanks.

21:02.553 --> 21:06.766
It's unusual to see a guest
in the employee area.

21:06.808 --> 21:08.977
Well, I was out taking a walk,
and ran into one

21:09.018 --> 21:11.437
of your ace plumbers here,
so I thought I'd tell her about

21:11.479 --> 21:13.272
a little issue with the cottage,
cut out the middleman.

21:13.314 --> 21:14.691
Yeah, I'm taking care
of it, Stevie.

21:14.732 --> 21:16.275
Have plunger, will travel.

21:16.317 --> 21:20.571
All right, well, uh,
any way I can help, please call.

21:20.613 --> 21:22.657
-(chuckles)
-I will.

21:22.699 --> 21:25.785
She has a disgusting rash
on her back.

21:25.827 --> 21:27.787
Susie, how would you
even know that?

21:27.829 --> 21:30.206
Seen her in the shower.
Part of it's oozing.

21:30.248 --> 21:32.417
Why do you have
to ruin Stevie for me?

21:32.458 --> 21:34.168
Sorry. Thought it was
interesting.

21:34.210 --> 21:35.795
I've got to get going.

21:35.837 --> 21:37.588
Hey, how did you get
your plunger back?

21:37.630 --> 21:39.424
I didn't. Kids here,
they got two cents between them,

21:39.465 --> 21:41.259
but they all pitched in
and got me a brand-new one.

21:41.300 --> 21:45.054
So thoughtful. Just makes me
hate my own family even more.

21:45.096 --> 21:47.098
-See you tomorrow.
-See you.

21:51.060 --> 21:53.229
It's Speech Synthesis.

21:53.271 --> 21:55.273
Speech Synthesis?

21:55.314 --> 21:58.151
MACHINE:
Hello. Hello.

21:58.192 --> 21:59.777
-Fascinating.
-It'll go way beyond

21:59.819 --> 22:01.362
just the production of words.

22:01.404 --> 22:04.157
The machine itself will
eventually know what to say.

22:04.198 --> 22:07.285
We are talking
artificial intelligence.

22:07.326 --> 22:08.703
The future is now.

22:08.745 --> 22:10.121
There are applications
in cryptography,

22:10.163 --> 22:12.540
satellite communications...

22:12.582 --> 22:15.126
God, I'd love
to tell you more about it,

22:15.168 --> 22:17.253
but I think I've said
all I can to someone

22:17.295 --> 22:19.172
without the proper
security clearance.

22:19.213 --> 22:21.632
It's pretty high-up stuff, son.

22:21.674 --> 22:23.134
I hope you understand.

22:23.176 --> 22:24.802
I get it, Pop.
A secret's a secret.

22:24.844 --> 22:26.763
-Afternoon, Abe.
-ABE: Devlin. Ah.

22:26.804 --> 22:28.681
Devlin's my mechanical engineer.
A real whiz.

22:28.723 --> 22:30.558
Devlin, this is my son Noah.

22:30.600 --> 22:32.643
I figured as much. Abe's been
talking about you non-stop.

22:32.685 --> 22:34.020
Well, it's in
his genetic profiling

22:34.062 --> 22:35.229
to boast about his offspring.

22:35.271 --> 22:36.981
Nice meeting you.

22:37.023 --> 22:39.275
Great guy. You would love
working with him.

22:39.317 --> 22:41.110
-Oh, I'm sure I would.
-Come on.

22:41.152 --> 22:43.154
Let me show you
more of the place.

22:43.196 --> 22:45.907
Gentlemen, my son Noah.

22:45.948 --> 22:48.993
-Hi.
-I-A-I-B-I-D.

22:49.035 --> 22:51.370
I insisted they let me
recruit my own team,

22:51.412 --> 22:53.289
because I wanted
a certain diversity.

22:53.331 --> 22:55.666
-I almost hired a woman.
-Good for you, Pop.

22:55.708 --> 22:57.919
But we're always
on the lookout for new talent.

22:57.960 --> 23:00.296
People like you.
Lester, meet my son.

23:00.338 --> 23:02.507
Ah, the famous Noah Weissman.

23:02.548 --> 23:04.217
-Nice meeting you.
-Same here.

23:04.258 --> 23:06.636
You haven't been boring people
about me, have you, Pop?

23:06.677 --> 23:08.179
Me? Maybe a little.

23:08.221 --> 23:10.306
Ah, Charles. Just the man
I wanted to see.

23:10.348 --> 23:12.058
What's up, Abe?

23:12.100 --> 23:14.185
-Here he is.
-I'll add some specifics.

23:14.227 --> 23:15.603
I'm Noah Weissman.

23:15.645 --> 23:18.106
The famous Noah Weissman.
(chuckles)

23:18.147 --> 23:20.900
Abe has raised you to me
so many times, I've lost count.

23:20.942 --> 23:22.318
You shouldn't do that,
Pop, really.

23:22.360 --> 23:24.320
Of course I should.
They need you here.

23:24.362 --> 23:26.114
Charles, I want you
to sit down with Noah today.

23:26.155 --> 23:29.367
I'd love to, Abe,
but I'm jammed with meetings.

23:29.408 --> 23:32.370
Sure, but carve some time out
for him as a favor to me.

23:32.411 --> 23:33.871
Really, Pop, if he's busy...

23:33.913 --> 23:35.498
Too busy to meet
a prospective Bell Labs star?

23:35.540 --> 23:37.291
Of course he's not.

23:37.333 --> 23:39.794
Abe, this is something that
is not going to happen today.

23:39.836 --> 23:43.256
But it's why I brought
Noah down here.

23:43.297 --> 23:44.507
It's not going to happen.

23:44.549 --> 23:45.758
Really, Charles,

23:45.800 --> 23:48.803
if you value our relationship...

23:48.845 --> 23:52.223
Abe, let's take this
into a secure room.

23:52.265 --> 23:54.308
A secure room?

23:54.350 --> 23:56.060
(lock buzzes)

23:56.102 --> 23:58.396
-Have a seat, please.
-All right.

23:58.437 --> 24:01.649
But, Charles,
I'm very confused here.

24:01.691 --> 24:04.277
-Why in the world are we...
-(lock buzzes)

24:04.318 --> 24:06.654
Fellas, this is Dabney Franklin,
head of security.

24:06.696 --> 24:09.073
Yes, Dabney,
I've seen you around the office,

24:09.115 --> 24:11.409
but why is the head
of security here?

24:11.450 --> 24:13.536
-Well, Abe, I'm afraid we...
-(lock buzzes)

24:13.578 --> 24:15.538
Come on in, Bob.
This is Bob Jackson,

24:15.580 --> 24:18.166
-head of our in-house counsel.
-Yes, hello.

24:18.207 --> 24:20.585
Okay, why is someone
from Legal here?

24:20.626 --> 24:23.087
-I don't-- For Pete's sake!
-(lock buzzes)

24:23.129 --> 24:24.714
Abe, this is Martin Cummings

24:24.755 --> 24:26.340
with our Government Liaison
Department,

24:26.382 --> 24:28.009
and I've asked Devlin here
as a witness.

24:28.050 --> 24:29.844
-Witness?
-Hello again.

24:29.886 --> 24:32.221
What-what the hell is going on?

24:32.263 --> 24:33.806
This is a little awkward, Abe,

24:33.848 --> 24:35.933
but I'm afraid
your actions forced the issue.

24:35.975 --> 24:37.852
-What actions?
-Well, you've been pressing
so hard

24:37.894 --> 24:39.270
about your son coming on board

24:39.312 --> 24:40.730
that I need
to tell you something.

24:40.771 --> 24:42.982
Noah can't work at Bell Labs.

24:43.024 --> 24:44.984
-What?
-The job you keep
pushing him for,

24:45.026 --> 24:46.235
it's not gonna happen.

24:46.277 --> 24:48.237
But he's so qualified.

24:48.279 --> 24:50.865
He graduated
top of his class at MIT

24:50.907 --> 24:53.868
and he's a top researcher
and he's barely 30.

24:53.910 --> 24:55.036
He's more than that, Abe.

24:55.077 --> 24:57.246
No, I'm quite sure he's 30.

24:57.288 --> 24:59.332
He's more
than a researcher, Abe.

24:59.373 --> 25:01.334
This is why we brought you
to a secure room.

25:01.375 --> 25:03.044
We're gonna let you know
a couple of things

25:03.085 --> 25:05.463
that a man so far down
the totem pole such as yourself

25:05.504 --> 25:07.506
normally wouldn't be privy to.
Martin?

25:07.548 --> 25:09.759
Your son is involved
in a highly classified project

25:09.800 --> 25:11.802
for the United States
government.

25:11.844 --> 25:13.596
(chuckles):
That's not true.

25:13.638 --> 25:15.973
-Is it?
-CHARLES: At the highest levels.

25:16.015 --> 25:18.351
MARTIN: He let me know
a few weeks ago that you

25:18.392 --> 25:20.895
were pushing for him to come
here, bandying his name about.

25:20.937 --> 25:22.897
-You talked to them?
-CHARLES:
He didn't have a choice, Abe.

25:22.939 --> 25:24.899
You were so vocal about it.
So persistent.

25:24.941 --> 25:26.817
But now you know.
It's not going to happen,

25:26.859 --> 25:28.486
there should be
no more mention of this,

25:28.527 --> 25:30.238
and thank you for your time.

25:30.279 --> 25:32.949
No, wait,
I have a security clearance.

25:32.990 --> 25:35.117
I think I deserve to know more.

25:35.159 --> 25:37.370
I'm going to be frank
with you, Abe.

25:37.411 --> 25:39.497
Your clearance level
is extremely low.

25:39.538 --> 25:42.124
It allows you to see some
non-consequential documents,

25:42.166 --> 25:44.961
but its level is not much above,
say, the janitorial staff.

25:45.002 --> 25:47.505
Theirs may be higher, what
with the disposal of documents,

25:47.546 --> 25:49.423
the shredding. Yeah,
I'm pretty sure the janitors

25:49.465 --> 25:51.509
have a higher security clearance
than you.

25:51.550 --> 25:55.221
What is this project
that's so high-profile?

25:55.263 --> 25:56.847
Noah?

25:56.889 --> 25:58.933
Sorry, Pop.

25:58.975 --> 26:01.102
A secret's a secret.

26:01.143 --> 26:03.813
CHARLES:
We're gonna debrief Noah a bit
on what happened today, Abe.

26:03.854 --> 26:05.773
Then you two can get back
to your vacation.

26:05.815 --> 26:07.191
Meaning?

26:07.233 --> 26:08.818
We need the room.

26:08.859 --> 26:10.778

you were coming back.

27:18.679 --> 27:21.265
I wasn't, but I had made
an appointment at the hair salon

refunds for cancellations.

Welcome to Steiner Mountain

Abe, don't! Don't!

-(whirring stops)
-What is wrong with you?

29:27.766 --> 29:30.311
Your son is not
who you think he is.

29:30.352 --> 29:32.313
He is a high-level...

29:32.354 --> 29:34.315
-I don't know what he is.
-Noah?

29:34.356 --> 29:36.650
-If that's his name.
-Of course that's his name.

29:36.692 --> 29:38.903
-What makes you so sure?
-We named him.

29:38.944 --> 29:41.906
Well, I am not calling him
Noah anymore.

29:41.947 --> 29:45.242
Until I find out more,
I am calling him Son-X.

29:45.284 --> 29:46.994
Abe, please,
you're not making sense.

29:47.036 --> 29:49.663
I got in trouble at Bell Labs,
and it's all his fault.

29:49.705 --> 29:51.081
-What did you do?
-Nothing.

29:51.123 --> 29:52.917
I talked him up to coworkers.

29:52.958 --> 29:55.085
-What did they say?
-That talking about my son

29:55.127 --> 29:57.254
was some sort
of high-level security breach

29:57.296 --> 30:00.341
that only me and the janitors
were not aware of.

30:00.382 --> 30:01.759
He works at a university.

30:01.800 --> 30:03.594
It's a cover. It's...

30:03.636 --> 30:05.012
it's a cover.

30:05.054 --> 30:06.514
And he's saying nothing.

30:06.555 --> 30:09.350
Three hours driving back,
he wouldn't answer one question.

30:09.391 --> 30:10.518
Not one.

30:10.559 --> 30:11.936
I was so mad.

30:11.977 --> 30:13.938
I didn't stop
for a bathroom break.

30:13.979 --> 30:16.357
And he had to go. Oh, yes.

30:16.398 --> 30:18.442
It was painfully obvious
he had to go.

30:18.484 --> 30:19.443
My God.

30:19.485 --> 30:22.196
I had to go, too.

30:22.238 --> 30:25.699
We think we know Son-X,

30:25.741 --> 30:28.536
(quietly):
but we don't know Son-X.

30:28.577 --> 30:31.080

Oh, bless you, Rose.

You're here for the service?

30:51.559 --> 30:53.018
Yes.

30:53.060 --> 30:54.436

30:54.478 --> 30:56.355
I don't even know
what time it is.

30:56.397 --> 30:58.607
It's around 3:00.

30:58.649 --> 31:01.694
The rabbi was going to cancel
when he saw it was just me,

31:01.735 --> 31:04.029
but I cried really hard,
so he stayed.

31:04.071 --> 31:06.031
So, yay.

31:06.073 --> 31:09.285

-It's pungent.

31:13.664 --> 31:14.957
-Okay.
-And oil-based.

31:14.999 --> 31:16.458
It doesn't respond to water.

31:16.500 --> 31:18.460
-No, it's fine.
-Okay.

31:30.639 --> 31:32.600
Oh, good.
Did they have a nice trip?

31:32.641 --> 31:34.852
They did.
They had a lot of time to talk.

31:34.893 --> 31:36.854
-Oh, good.
-Yeah.

31:36.895 --> 31:39.189
Noah talked
about his work a little bit.

31:39.231 --> 31:40.608
He doesn't do that much.

31:40.649 --> 31:42.109
Oh, it's a complicated subject,

31:42.151 --> 31:43.694
-I can tell you.
-Yes?

31:43.736 --> 31:45.696
But I'm not supposed
to tell you.

31:45.738 --> 31:49.199
Oh, of course.

31:49.241 --> 31:50.951
But it's complicated.

31:50.993 --> 31:52.620
(sputters)
Oy, doo zugst mir.

31:52.661 --> 31:54.622
-So much travel.
-Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Really?

31:54.663 --> 31:56.790
-Where does he go?
-Oh, he doesn't say.

31:56.832 --> 31:59.543
Although, sometimes when he gets
back, there's sand in his shoes.

31:59.585 --> 32:00.753
-Sand?
-And his gun.

32:00.794 --> 32:02.421
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, it comes out.

32:02.463 --> 32:04.590
He cleans it, oils it.
It's good as new.

32:04.632 --> 32:06.675
-He carries a gun.
-Sometimes.

32:06.717 --> 32:08.427

32:12.222 --> 32:15.184
Oh, yes. Yes, I am.

32:15.225 --> 32:18.395

the company?

32:18.437 --> 32:20.814
-Sort of.
-Or-or the other place he works

32:20.856 --> 32:22.149
is the company?

32:22.191 --> 32:23.734
Did I say
there was another place?

32:23.776 --> 32:25.569
-You implied it.
-I didn't mean to.

32:25.611 --> 32:28.405
Oh, well, does-does he keep
in touch when he's away?

32:28.447 --> 32:30.658
-He usually can't.
-But if he's away

32:30.699 --> 32:32.826
-and you need to reach him,
are you able to?
-Not really.

32:32.868 --> 32:34.828
What would you do
in an emergency?

32:34.870 --> 32:37.414
Oh, I don't know. I can't
just dial the operator and say,

32:37.456 --> 32:40.417
"Give me the CIA."
It doesn't work that way.

32:40.459 --> 32:42.252
Of course not.

Oh.

32:51.095 --> 32:52.471
How? When?

32:52.513 --> 32:55.057
They must have recruited him
in college.

32:55.099 --> 32:57.142
Does he... kill people?

32:57.184 --> 32:58.727
I don't think so.

32:58.769 --> 33:01.730
I-I would like to know
if my son kills people.

33:01.772 --> 33:05.359

14, 15, 16 hours--

35:16.782 --> 35:18.951
these alta kakas get dopey

35:22.871 --> 35:25.457
They wouldn't know anyway.
These people are quite old.

SHIRLEY: That's when
I swoop in for the kill.

35:27.251 --> 35:28.669
And I make them pay on the spot.

35:28.710 --> 35:31.630
Even if I have to march them
down to the Western Union,

35:31.672 --> 35:32.923
they will pay.

35:32.965 --> 35:34.800
Sounds very exciting, Shirley.

35:34.842 --> 35:37.719
I come home on a high.
I can't get to sleep.

35:37.761 --> 35:39.847
That's when
the lovemaking starts.

35:39.888 --> 35:42.599
You know, guys, maybe that's
as far as the story should go.

35:42.641 --> 35:44.268
And maybe not even that far.

35:44.309 --> 35:47.938
That's why we get a cottage
so far away from everybody else.

35:47.980 --> 35:50.232
And thank you for that, Shirley.

35:50.274 --> 35:52.609
MOISHE:
At one point, Shirl was down 12.

35:52.651 --> 35:55.612
Can you believe it? At the end,
she won it back and then some.

35:55.654 --> 35:57.990
-You always end up on top,
don't you, Shirl?

My God, I've only ever played

35:59.825 --> 36:02.619
mah-jongg for pennies.
I've never lost $12.

36:02.661 --> 36:06.456
$12? Honey, no,
I was down $1,200.

36:06.498 --> 36:09.209
Who would play for a lousy $12?

36:09.251 --> 36:11.461
Shirley, you were down $1,200?

36:11.503 --> 36:13.088
SHIRLEY:
Oh, it sounds like a lot,

36:13.130 --> 36:15.674

Hey, so, what did you do
with our Abe,

36:18.135 --> 36:20.095
Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm?

36:20.137 --> 36:22.097
Your super sunshiny disposition

36:22.139 --> 36:24.433
is in such stark contrast
to his.

36:24.474 --> 36:26.226
Moishe, I'm in a fine mood

36:26.268 --> 36:28.520
and having a wonderful time
with my wife and my children.

36:28.562 --> 36:31.189
Please stop focusing on me
and focus on the festivities.

36:31.231 --> 36:34.276
Really, you should
replace Buzz up there, Abe.

36:34.318 --> 36:37.070
Infect the crowd
with your enthusiasm.

36:37.112 --> 36:38.614
Be in whatever mood
you want to be in, Pop.

36:38.655 --> 36:41.199
-Don't let him push you around.
-No one pushes me around, son.

36:41.241 --> 36:43.660
I do what I want, just like
everybody else around me

36:43.702 --> 36:45.162
does whatever the hell
they want,

36:45.203 --> 36:47.164
no matter what the effect.

36:47.205 --> 36:48.415
Papa, Noah was
just saying that...

36:48.457 --> 36:50.876
I understand what he was saying.

36:50.918 --> 36:53.629
Unless it's some sort of code.

36:53.670 --> 36:55.464

36:57.299 --> 37:00.010
All right, everybody.
It's that time.

37:00.052 --> 37:01.845
We look forward all season

37:01.887 --> 37:04.264
to seeing how the gang
is gonna entertain us.

37:04.306 --> 37:07.851
You know them.
You love them. You tip them.

37:07.893 --> 37:10.062
-We do. We do.
-They're our wonderful
Steiner employees,

37:10.103 --> 37:11.980
and they're here
to put on a show.

37:12.022 --> 37:15.192

Last week,
I went up to Connecticut,

42:31.174 --> 42:33.969
'cause in Connecticut,
I found out they have

42:34.010 --> 42:36.221
very exclusive kennel clubs.

42:36.263 --> 42:39.516
I'll tell you how exclusive
one kennel club was up there.

42:39.557 --> 42:43.061
Little sign outside said
"No dogs allowed."

42:45.272 --> 42:48.441
Really, Astrid, you have nothing
to be concerned about.

42:48.483 --> 42:50.694
Well, that's the problem.
I don't remember what I said.

42:50.735 --> 42:52.362
I was so weak from fasting.

42:52.404 --> 42:54.406
I just have this sense
that somehow I blew it.

42:54.447 --> 42:56.992
No, no, you said
nothing unusual.

42:57.033 --> 43:00.745
-Good. I feel better.
-Mm-hmm.

43:00.787 --> 43:02.289
PHIL:
...very interesting:

43:02.330 --> 43:05.333
they let the dog
pick out his own name.

43:05.375 --> 43:08.295
Yeah. He hears the name,
he knows it,

43:08.336 --> 43:10.505
he turns around and he answers.

43:10.547 --> 43:12.090
So I tried it out.

43:12.132 --> 43:15.468
I said "Prince," he went "Ruff."

43:15.510 --> 43:18.471
I said "King," he went "Ruff."

43:18.513 --> 43:21.808
I said "Spotty," he went "Eh..."

43:23.727 --> 43:25.687
Because, to tell you
the truth...

43:25.729 --> 43:28.189

43:36.489 --> 43:38.450
-Doing what?
-Yeah, what are you guys
talking about?

43:38.491 --> 43:41.453
What are we talking about?
It's a secret, okay?

43:41.494 --> 43:42.954
You know secrets, Noah.

43:42.996 --> 43:44.789
Are we not allowed
to have secrets?

43:44.831 --> 43:47.000
-What's secret? What's going on?
-Nothing is going on.

43:47.042 --> 43:49.044
I'm just trying
to enjoy the comedian.

43:49.085 --> 43:50.628

I said, "I don't care
about the dog's parents."

43:58.303 --> 44:00.472
He said, "I'm not talking
about the dog's parents..."

44:00.513 --> 44:03.641
-Yes.
