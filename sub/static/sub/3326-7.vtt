00:01.043 --> 00:02.579
Previously on Teen Wolf...

00:02.795 --> 00:04.035
I know a little about this pack.

00:04.213 --> 00:06.044
Their Alpha is a woman named Satomi.

00:06.215 --> 00:08.206
They have a kind of
secret meeting place in the woods.

00:10.386 --> 00:12.718
Meredith's gone.
They found her an hour ago in her room.

00:12.930 --> 00:15.216
- Peter and Malia?
- Father and daughter.

00:16.517 --> 00:17.973
We should probably count it.

01:02.188 --> 01:04.304
After entering the IP address,
you will be connected

01:04.524 --> 01:07.607
through a Darknet portal
to an untraceable bank.

01:08.569 --> 01:10.685
Once logged in,
enter your account number

01:10.905 --> 01:12.770
to receive wire transfers.

01:12.990 --> 01:16.027
The IP address will deactivate
with each transfer.

01:16.244 --> 01:17.984
You will be assigned a new IP address

01:18.204 --> 01:20.911
if you choose to continue down the list.

01:21.123 --> 01:26.709
Remember, visual confirmation
is always required for payment.

01:29.382 --> 01:31.668
- You ever made a wire transfer?
- Never had enough money.

01:31.842 --> 01:33.582
So you didn't understand
a word of that either?

01:33.803 --> 01:35.134
I don't understand any of this.

01:35.429 --> 01:38.341
Why would someone
use all this money just to kill us?

01:38.558 --> 01:41.049
Someone wants you dead, dude.
Badly.

01:46.065 --> 01:47.225
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing?

01:47.441 --> 01:49.523
It's late.
We've got the PSATs in the morning.

01:49.735 --> 01:52.442
No, I meant the money.
$500,000.

01:52.655 --> 01:54.611
You know how much money that is?

01:55.533 --> 01:57.569
- It's 500,000...
- It's half a million dollars. Scott.

01:57.785 --> 01:59.776
What are you going to do,
just slide it under your mattress?

01:59.996 --> 02:01.577
I have to talk to Derek.
The money's his.

02:01.789 --> 02:03.154
You mean his and Peter's.

02:04.417 --> 02:05.782
What does that mean?

02:06.002 --> 02:08.334
It means maybe we should
proceed with caution.

02:09.672 --> 02:12.379
- You don't think we should tell Derek?
- No.

02:13.759 --> 02:14.839
No.

02:18.639 --> 02:21.597
No, of course
we have to tell him. I'm just...

02:23.311 --> 02:25.768
I'm just saying,
some of that money's Peter's, right?

02:27.398 --> 02:29.810
- Yeah.
- Right? Peter.

02:30.234 --> 02:34.318
Homicidal killer? Remember?
You want to give $500,000 to him.

02:35.740 --> 02:39.403
So we should give Derek
his money back. But not Peter?

02:39.660 --> 02:40.991
I didn't say that.

02:43.789 --> 02:45.871
Stiles, what are you saying?

02:59.138 --> 03:01.595
We found Satomi's pack.
Derek and I.

03:01.766 --> 03:03.006
But they're dead.

03:03.517 --> 03:05.599
- All of them?
- All the ones we found.

03:05.811 --> 03:07.017
Then where's Derek?

03:11.776 --> 03:13.061
She's been shot!

03:14.028 --> 03:15.359
I think she's dying.

03:44.850 --> 03:46.966
You could have called, Satomi-san.

04:34.191 --> 04:36.648
- Where's Lydia?
- She took it her freshman year.

04:36.861 --> 04:38.647
Does that mean
I could have taken it some other time?

04:38.863 --> 04:41.650
Malia, you studied harder for this
than any of us.

04:41.866 --> 04:43.948
- Doesn't mean I'm gonna do good.
- Well...

04:45.077 --> 04:46.192
Well, what?

04:46.454 --> 04:47.694
It's do well, not good.

04:48.080 --> 04:49.536
- Oh, God!
- Okay, okay.

04:49.790 --> 04:51.326
You're doing this,

04:51.500 --> 04:53.991
because while we're trying not to die,
we still need to live.

04:54.462 --> 04:58.000
It I survive high school,
I'd like to go to college. A good college.

04:58.215 --> 05:00.752
It's only three hours.
We can survive three hours.

05:12.980 --> 05:15.562
Cell phone in the envelope, Scott.
You'll get it back after the test.

05:28.370 --> 05:31.703
Please do not open the test booklet
until you are instructed to do so.

05:33.542 --> 05:35.453
This test is two hours and 10 minutes.

05:35.711 --> 05:38.703
There will be two 25-minute
critical reading sections,

05:38.923 --> 05:40.538
two 25-minute math sections

05:40.758 --> 05:43.124
and an essay writing portion
that will last 30 minutes.

05:43.636 --> 05:46.628
There are supposed to be
two teachers monitoring this exam.

05:46.847 --> 05:49.554
I know. It's Coach.
He's not exactly punctual.

05:49.767 --> 05:51.928
Um, let me just try him again.

06:03.656 --> 06:04.816
Oh, no.

06:07.576 --> 06:08.656
Hey, get up.

06:11.038 --> 06:12.198
Hey.

06:13.916 --> 06:14.996
Oh, Bobby.

06:15.751 --> 06:19.039
15 years sober and you
fall off the wagon at school?

06:19.797 --> 06:22.129
Coach, look at me. It's Natalie.

06:24.051 --> 06:25.257
Forget it.

06:26.262 --> 06:28.924
I'll bring you some coffee
during one of the breaks.

06:30.057 --> 06:31.763
15 years, Bobby.

06:39.191 --> 06:42.558
I can't find him, but Mr. Yukimura
is upstairs grading papers.

06:42.778 --> 06:44.643
- Do you want me to try him?
- We have to start.

06:44.864 --> 06:47.446
We can ask for his assistance
during the first break.

06:53.747 --> 06:56.739
You may now open
your test booklets and begin.

07:33.329 --> 07:34.535
Sydney!

07:37.791 --> 07:39.497
Are you all right?

07:40.544 --> 07:43.752
I'm okay. ljust got kind of dizzy.

07:45.591 --> 07:48.173
Sydney, how long have you had this?

07:51.805 --> 07:54.547
- I don't know.
- Ms. Martin, do I need to stop the test?

07:55.267 --> 07:58.259
No, um, it's fine.

08:04.902 --> 08:08.065
Everybody stay in your seats.
|'||, um, be back in a minute.

08:10.115 --> 08:11.776
Nobody leaves the room.

09:02.584 --> 09:04.085
Get back! No!

09:04.294 --> 09:06.455
Do not come in here!
Get back outside!

09:12.344 --> 09:13.720
Back to your seats. Now.

09:15.222 --> 09:16.177
Please.

09:23.814 --> 09:25.645
I need the number of the CDC.

09:27.484 --> 09:29.600
Yes, the Center for Disease Control.

10:37.221 --> 10:40.634
Excuse me. Can anyone tell me
what we're dealing with here?

10:40.808 --> 10:43.470
Hopefully a false alarm.
The details provided have concerned us

10:43.685 --> 10:45.937
and your local health authorities
enough to order a quarantine.

10:46.146 --> 10:49.183
We're going to need your help ensuring
that no one gets in or out of the school.

10:49.399 --> 10:52.562
- My son is in there.
- Is this gonna be a conflict for you?

10:52.986 --> 10:54.977
Conflict? No.

10:55.197 --> 10:56.607
Stressful? Yeah.

10:57.324 --> 10:59.030
All right. What happens now?

10:59.326 --> 11:01.738
We isolate the sick
and then we wait for instructions.

11:02.287 --> 11:04.278
If I'm wrong,
they'll be out of here pretty quickly,

11:04.498 --> 11:07.661
and then I'm the crazy biology teacher
who panicked for nothing.

11:13.799 --> 11:15.209
Hey.

11:15.801 --> 11:18.008
- You're gonna be okay.
- It's not that.

11:18.220 --> 11:21.929
The PSATs, the qualifying tests
for the National Merit Scholarship.

11:23.267 --> 11:26.634
My parents can't afford
to send me to college without it.

11:26.854 --> 11:28.515
Well, I'm sure
they'll let you take it again.

11:34.111 --> 11:35.897
Bet they're thinking smallpox.

11:36.071 --> 11:37.231
Not likely.

11:37.698 --> 11:40.815
Smallpox was eradicated
worldwide in 1979.

11:42.244 --> 11:45.031
We've only managed to completely
eradicate two viruses in history.

11:45.247 --> 11:46.737
The other was rinderpest.

11:47.666 --> 11:48.781
It killed cows.

11:48.959 --> 11:50.915
So we should be
comforted by that, right?

11:51.336 --> 11:53.076
Unless it's something worse.

11:56.800 --> 11:59.041
Whatever it is,
they're taking it pretty seriously.

11:59.261 --> 12:01.217
They're a lot of cars
and trucks out there.

12:01.430 --> 12:03.716
- We're doing the best we can.
- Your dad's with them.

12:04.141 --> 12:06.223
Hey, I should probably call him.

12:06.602 --> 12:07.762
Don't bother.

12:08.562 --> 12:12.475
They would have shut off any access
to all outside communication by now.

12:13.400 --> 12:16.517
No cell service, no WiFi.
No one starting a panic.

12:17.779 --> 12:21.613
Looks like we're all just going to have to
wait here and see what happens.

12:29.291 --> 12:30.997
- How does it begin?
- With fever.

12:31.210 --> 12:33.417
Then shifting becomes uncontrollable.

12:33.629 --> 12:37.998
Fangs, claws, even full,
unwarranted transformations.

12:38.383 --> 12:40.499
We moved into the woods
when that began.

12:41.553 --> 12:44.795
Then it progressed faster and faster.
They couldn't stand.

12:45.766 --> 12:48.428
But worse than that
was this sudden blindness.

12:49.770 --> 12:51.931
- Total?
- They couldn't see a thing.

12:53.232 --> 12:57.350
From there, they had
only a few minutes left.

12:59.071 --> 13:02.359
I'm going to be honest, Satomi.
We need to get him to a hospital.

13:02.574 --> 13:06.066
That's never really been
an option for our kind.

13:08.247 --> 13:10.203
Unless you know something I don't.

13:10.415 --> 13:13.452
Not something, but someone.

13:30.811 --> 13:33.427
- What's that?
- Naloxone. We need to wake her up.

13:34.606 --> 13:35.686
I thought you said she needed to rest.

13:35.899 --> 13:38.891
That was before I found out the CDC
just put the high school under quarantine

13:39.111 --> 13:41.067
with Scott and Stiles still in there.

13:44.950 --> 13:46.986
Braeden, look at me.

13:47.286 --> 13:49.493
You were shot, but you're
in the hospital now and you're fine.

13:49.705 --> 13:51.195
Do you understand?

13:53.834 --> 13:55.790
Good. Okay.

13:57.296 --> 14:00.254
Last night you were in the woods
and you came across another pack?

14:00.465 --> 14:03.298
- Do you know what happened to them?
- I told you, they were poisoned.

14:03.510 --> 14:04.625
No.

14:05.971 --> 14:07.586
No, they were infected.

14:08.682 --> 14:12.049
It was a virus
designed to kill werewolves.

14:13.395 --> 14:14.885
And it did.

14:16.189 --> 14:17.395
It killed them all.

14:19.401 --> 14:22.359
Scott? You've been in there
a long time, you all right?

14:23.989 --> 14:25.854
Hey, you need to come back
with the others.

15:48.657 --> 15:49.988
All right, Meredith.

15:50.242 --> 15:51.903
I'm not sure how to do this.

15:53.161 --> 15:54.446
I'm not a psychic.

15:54.996 --> 15:58.830
And apparently I'm not
much of a Banshee either.

16:01.545 --> 16:03.501
But I'm trying to help my friends.

16:06.341 --> 16:08.047
I don't know if you can hear me.

16:08.885 --> 16:10.341
Or, uh,

16:12.806 --> 16:14.967
what I'm supposed to ask you.

16:19.104 --> 16:22.767
But if I have this thing,
it's got to work some of the time.

16:26.194 --> 16:27.775
It's gotta help someone.

16:44.546 --> 16:47.458
Maybe what I really
wanted to say was...

16:54.556 --> 16:55.921
I'm sorry.

17:00.979 --> 17:02.810
| wish I could have helped you.

17:07.777 --> 17:08.732
I'm sorry.

17:57.953 --> 17:59.284
Get Stiles.

18:06.253 --> 18:10.212
Kira, do you ever get the feeling that

18:10.423 --> 18:13.210
Scott and Stiles
aren't telling you everything?

18:15.178 --> 18:17.134
What do you mean?

18:17.347 --> 18:18.962
Like they hide stuff.

18:20.058 --> 18:24.472
I think if they did,
they probably have a pretty good reason.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.726
Do you know what they're hiding
in the bag under Scott's bed?

18:30.360 --> 18:32.726
What? No, I've never been
under Scott's bed.

18:32.946 --> 18:35.779
Or in it. Just on it... Wearing clothes.

18:38.243 --> 18:40.029
Kira Yukimura.

18:41.955 --> 18:43.070
You feeling all right, Kira?

18:47.836 --> 18:51.044
I don't like needles either.
I promise, it'll be fast.

19:03.977 --> 19:06.639
Kira. Kira!

19:12.611 --> 19:14.397
Excuse me. Excuse me.

19:14.988 --> 19:17.525
- Careful, Doctor. Slowly...
- What happened in there?

19:17.741 --> 19:19.356
I don't know,
must have been static electricity.

19:19.576 --> 19:22.238
- Any breach of the interior layer?
- It's okay, it just broke the top layer.

19:22.454 --> 19:24.319
Any verdict on what we're
dealing with yet? My son's in there.

19:24.539 --> 19:27.906
Your son and his son. Great.
You can debrief each other.

19:29.794 --> 19:32.046
I heard smallpox. Any truth to that?

19:32.464 --> 19:33.829
You want my opinion?

19:35.425 --> 19:38.838
I don't think the Orphans were the only
professional killers in Beacon Hills.

19:49.230 --> 19:50.390
It's still happening.

19:55.445 --> 19:57.026
I can't make them go back.

19:57.781 --> 19:59.567
Obviously the virus is
affecting the two of you

19:59.783 --> 20:01.114
in a way it won't hit any human being.

20:01.326 --> 20:03.908
You guys have to stay out of sight.
We have to quarantine you

20:04.120 --> 20:06.372
- from the quarantine.
- Yeah, but where?

20:06.581 --> 20:08.492
I mean, what if they get violent?
Like on a full moon.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.744
We shouldn't stay in here.
Not in the locker room.

20:10.960 --> 20:12.575
A classroom is not going to hold us.

20:12.796 --> 20:14.457
- What about the basement?
- Too many ways out.

20:14.964 --> 20:17.956
We need something secure.
Somewhere nobody can find us.

20:18.176 --> 20:19.256
The vault.

20:23.431 --> 20:25.683
- The Hale vault.
- The Hales always have an escape route.

20:25.892 --> 20:29.180
Like their house.
There has to be another way in.

20:30.730 --> 20:33.221
This is where the school sign is,
so the vault's got to be right about here.

20:33.441 --> 20:35.102
I suppose if there's a second entrance,

20:35.318 --> 20:37.855
it would probably be
accessible from the basement.

20:38.113 --> 20:39.819
It's probably somewhere
in this hallway.

20:40.031 --> 20:41.316
West corridor.

20:44.327 --> 20:45.316
Whoa.

20:47.747 --> 20:49.248
It's happening to you too.

20:49.791 --> 20:52.658
You're getting sick. You all are.

20:54.713 --> 20:56.669
I don't feel sick.

20:56.923 --> 21:00.211
I think it's affecting
you differently, neurologically.

21:02.262 --> 21:05.470
I found your test answers here
in a pile with the others.

21:42.427 --> 21:43.507
Hey, guys...

21:44.471 --> 21:45.551
Over here.

21:57.233 --> 21:59.019
Look at the cracks in the wall.

21:59.444 --> 22:01.480
It's like the entrance outside,
it only opens with claws.

22:02.781 --> 22:04.146
Anyone's claws, right?

22:10.705 --> 22:11.740
Um...

22:12.373 --> 22:13.909
Malia, can you try?

22:14.501 --> 22:15.911
Why me?

22:16.669 --> 22:18.534
I don't have control.

22:21.633 --> 22:23.214
Okay. I'll do it.

22:24.177 --> 22:26.714
But first tell me what
you've been hiding from me.

22:29.808 --> 22:32.971
I know you think you're trying
to protect me, but I can handle it.

22:41.319 --> 22:42.729
I know I'm on the list.

22:47.492 --> 22:48.857
Yes...

22:51.579 --> 22:53.444
- So how much?
- How much what?

22:53.706 --> 22:55.913
- How much am I worth?
- Four million.

23:00.922 --> 23:02.207
Are you okay?

23:04.634 --> 23:08.047
Yeah. Scott's worth 25,
Kira, six.

23:08.263 --> 23:11.050
They'll take you guys out
way before me.

23:14.686 --> 23:16.802
It's progress. It's progress.

23:55.602 --> 23:58.344
Okay. This isn't happening
at the school, is it?

23:58.563 --> 24:01.054
- School? It's Saturday.
- They're taking the PSATs.

24:03.109 --> 24:04.315
I think we need to hurry.

24:11.659 --> 24:12.648
Come on.

24:51.115 --> 24:52.730
You know,
this is where it all started.

24:54.994 --> 24:56.825
That's where the money was.

24:57.997 --> 25:00.488
117 million in bearer bonds.

25:02.460 --> 25:04.701
How do you even change
bearer bonds into cash?

25:05.421 --> 25:06.797
The bank, I guess.

25:07.173 --> 25:09.880
They just let it sit here the whole time
collecting dust.

25:12.428 --> 25:14.589
You know bearer bonds
are basically extinct?

25:14.806 --> 25:16.296
Why does it matter?

25:16.516 --> 25:18.632
You know how many problems
that money could solve?

25:18.851 --> 25:19.806
For you?

25:20.520 --> 25:21.760
Me. My dad...

25:25.358 --> 25:27.940
The Eichen House and MRI bills
are crushing him.

25:31.239 --> 25:32.729
Mom does this thing,

25:33.783 --> 25:36.320
she writes down
all the items in our budget,

25:36.536 --> 25:37.901
and how much they cost,

25:39.539 --> 25:42.781
then she adds them all up
and figures out how long we have until...

25:43.376 --> 25:44.616
We lose the house.

25:51.926 --> 25:53.086
Sheriff!

25:53.803 --> 25:56.761
- Sheriff!
- Whoa, hey! I know this girl, let her in.

25:59.726 --> 26:01.808
My mom's in there.
What's happening?

26:03.312 --> 26:04.267
We're working on it.

26:12.280 --> 26:13.611
Anything?

26:13.781 --> 26:14.816
They're looking for us.

26:15.033 --> 26:17.115
Someone's going to
have to go out there.

26:29.881 --> 26:32.293
We need to tell her
the truth about Peter.

26:34.218 --> 26:36.254
She's going to see
the rest of the dead pool eventually.

26:38.681 --> 26:41.764
Try to remember that Peter is
the one name missing on that list.

26:41.976 --> 26:44.592
Which either makes him
incredibly lucky or The Benefactor.

26:44.812 --> 26:47.599
She finds out about him
she's going to go to him, you know she is.

26:47.774 --> 26:50.311
And then he's gonna twist his way
into her head like he does with everyone.

26:50.526 --> 26:51.686
Including us.

26:53.029 --> 26:55.111
We let him walk around
like nothing ever happened,

26:55.323 --> 26:56.733
like he's one of the good guys.

26:56.949 --> 26:59.110
Scott, he's not one of the good guys.

27:00.703 --> 27:02.739
If she finds out about him, she's gone.

27:04.290 --> 27:06.952
That's probably what he's waiting for.
And then he wins, we lose.

27:07.168 --> 27:08.829
We're already losing.

27:27.271 --> 27:28.807
I think I know what this is.

27:29.524 --> 27:32.982
Unfortunately, if I'm right, and Scott
and the rest are infected, it's not good.

27:35.113 --> 27:37.274
They're going to die
without an antidote.

27:43.412 --> 27:44.367
Malia...

27:45.790 --> 27:46.905
Malia.

27:53.673 --> 27:54.628
Hey...

28:01.639 --> 28:03.595
I gotta leave for a few, okay?

28:05.017 --> 28:06.143
Where are you going?

28:06.352 --> 28:08.718
Whatever's happening,
it's worse for you guys.

28:12.150 --> 28:15.233
That means it's not just people
getting sick, it's another assassin.

28:24.579 --> 28:25.739
Here.

28:38.759 --> 28:40.260
You're coming back, right?

28:42.680 --> 28:43.760
Yeah.

28:44.807 --> 28:46.718
Yeah, I'd never leave you behind.

29:38.778 --> 29:40.439
What are you still doing here?

29:41.072 --> 29:43.484
I'm protecting my investment.

29:44.492 --> 29:46.028
Got a lot of money riding on you.

29:47.954 --> 29:50.741
Derek. I think there's someone here
you've been trying to find.

29:57.338 --> 30:00.501
Lydia, as all this is still very new to me,

30:00.883 --> 30:03.499
and I don't know how it works,
I still have to ask.

30:03.719 --> 30:05.380
Do you have any kind of...

30:05.596 --> 30:06.631
Indication?

30:07.807 --> 30:09.593
Any kind of feeling about this?

30:10.935 --> 30:12.516
ls someone in there going to die?

30:12.728 --> 30:13.717
Yes.

30:14.772 --> 30:16.308
And it's not just a feeling.

30:18.067 --> 30:21.480
It's a variant of canine distemper.
A few years ago,

30:21.696 --> 30:24.529
an outbreak in Yellowstone
killed 40% of the wolf population.

30:24.740 --> 30:26.605
What's it going to do
to our wolf population?

30:26.784 --> 30:29.491
Well, it's been altered
to infect quite a bit faster.

30:29.704 --> 30:32.036
- You mean it's been weaponized?
- It infected my whole pack.

30:32.248 --> 30:34.034
Everyone except for you.

30:34.250 --> 30:36.582
That's the real question.
Did you not get infected?

30:36.794 --> 30:38.000
Or are you immune?

30:45.261 --> 30:48.003
Stiles, you're not looking so good,
maybe you ought to lie down.

30:48.222 --> 30:49.928
It's okay.
Have you seen Mr. Yukimura?

30:50.141 --> 30:52.427
Yeah, he's fine,
he's helping the other students.

30:52.643 --> 30:53.758
Okay.

30:59.775 --> 31:01.731
ls Coach the only adult
who got sick today?

31:02.028 --> 31:02.983
As far as I know.

31:03.738 --> 31:05.194
Why is he the only one?

31:06.157 --> 31:09.069
Stiles?
I think you should lie down.

31:09.285 --> 31:11.947
Yeah, no, it's okay.
I'll be back, I'll be right back.

31:15.207 --> 31:16.538
If your pack was infected,

31:16.751 --> 31:18.707
then who was doing all the shooting
at the entrance to the woods?

31:18.919 --> 31:20.375
Apparently another assassin.

31:20.629 --> 31:23.587
Personally, I'd rather face a gun
than a variant of smallpox.

31:23.799 --> 31:26.506
Sounds like you're
going to get plenty of chances.

31:30.222 --> 31:31.428
Sorry.

31:32.099 --> 31:35.967
I just noticed
how much you remind me of Talia.

31:37.271 --> 31:39.387
| used to visit her a lot, you know.

31:40.316 --> 31:42.898
- Do you remember me?
- I remember the tea.

31:43.444 --> 31:45.981
You always brought that tea
that smelled terrible.

31:47.239 --> 31:50.823
I brought that tea as a gift.
Your mother loved it.

31:51.494 --> 31:52.779
What kind of tea?

31:55.164 --> 31:57.576
- What?
- The tea with the smell, what kind was it?

31:57.792 --> 31:59.783
Reishi. Wild purple reishi.

32:00.002 --> 32:01.162
It's very rare.

32:01.379 --> 32:03.665
It's also a very powerful remedy
for sickness.

32:03.881 --> 32:06.588
Satomi, you didn't get infected
because you've been inoculated.

32:09.595 --> 32:12.086
Okay, okay. How rare is it?

32:12.306 --> 32:14.137
- Can we find it?
- We don't have to.

32:14.934 --> 32:16.595
My mother kept some of it.

32:17.395 --> 32:18.635
It's in our vault.

32:45.714 --> 32:46.749
Malia.

32:57.268 --> 32:58.303
Malia?

33:01.856 --> 33:03.062
I can't see.

33:04.316 --> 33:06.022
I can't see anything.

34:07.505 --> 34:09.996
I was wondering
how that idiot got sick.

34:10.799 --> 34:12.630
I'm also wondering
where your friends are.

34:14.136 --> 34:16.127
Since in order
to get paid by The Benefactor,

34:16.347 --> 34:18.258
I need to have proof they're dead.

34:19.558 --> 34:20.934
Visual confirmation.

34:24.188 --> 34:25.303
Exactly.

34:35.783 --> 34:37.739
What the hell is going on?

34:57.304 --> 35:00.171
- The lesions are gone.
- Can I take the test again now?

35:04.061 --> 35:05.426
They're getting better.

35:05.980 --> 35:07.390
They're all getting better.

35:22.454 --> 35:24.160
What's happening to us?

35:24.373 --> 35:26.580
Scott? I can't...

35:26.792 --> 35:28.157
I can't see.

35:40.222 --> 35:42.133
You still look feverish, Mr. Stilinski.

35:42.308 --> 35:43.844
But you should know something.

35:44.059 --> 35:47.551
The virus doesn't kill humans,
you'll get better.

35:48.188 --> 35:51.021
So don't you think
you should tell me where they are?

35:52.151 --> 35:54.187
Shouldn't one of you get to live?

35:56.447 --> 35:58.062
I think I saw them in the library.

35:59.783 --> 36:02.399
Or it might've been the cafeteria.
It was definitely one of those two though.

36:03.495 --> 36:07.238
I'm going to count to three,
and then I'm going to kill you.

36:13.297 --> 36:14.912
Think you can scare me?

36:15.799 --> 36:17.255
No, I think I can kill you.

36:17.801 --> 36:20.383
I just thought the countdown
would make it more exciting.

36:21.555 --> 36:22.761
So...

36:24.224 --> 36:25.509
One...

36:28.312 --> 36:29.347
Two...

36:52.086 --> 36:54.828
- Where the hell did you come from?
- Stiles, listen.

36:55.047 --> 36:57.379
I got a call from Melissa.
I don't know what it means.

36:57.591 --> 37:00.378
She said there's an antidote.
It's in the vault, reishi mushrooms.

37:00.594 --> 37:03.552
- Wait, what in the vault?
- It's in a jar on one of the shelves.

37:03.806 --> 37:06.297
She said to tell Scott,
it's in the vault.

37:10.020 --> 37:13.137
- l have to get to the school.
- What about the others at Lookout Point?

37:52.146 --> 37:54.011
I may have learned
to control my anger,

37:56.734 --> 37:58.520
but I still know when to use it.

37:58.819 --> 38:01.856
Hey, Scott? Scotty?

38:02.906 --> 38:05.113
In the vault, in there with you.

38:05.409 --> 38:07.491
It's called reishi mushrooms.

38:08.162 --> 38:09.242
Scott!

38:12.791 --> 38:13.997
Scott, open the door!

38:14.209 --> 38:17.872
It's in there with you.
It's in a jar, it's on one of the shelves.

38:18.088 --> 38:19.419
Scott!

38:20.007 --> 38:21.463
Scott, can you hear me?

38:45.699 --> 38:48.065
Reishi... Scott, I saw it.

38:48.285 --> 38:50.321
In a jar on one of the shelves.

38:51.497 --> 38:52.907
Reishi...

40:39.938 --> 40:42.475
Excuse us, excuse us.
Pardon me. Excuse me.

40:48.614 --> 40:49.945
Mom. Mom!

40:50.657 --> 40:51.737
Lydia!

40:54.077 --> 40:56.693
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

40:58.081 --> 41:00.993
I was just
trying to get a little overtime.

41:10.052 --> 41:11.508
Hey, you all right?

41:13.889 --> 41:15.299
Malia?

41:18.101 --> 41:19.557
Malia?
