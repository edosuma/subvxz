00:31.905 --> 00:34.634
Bzz, bzz, bzz, bzz, bzz!

00:34.701 --> 00:36.941
The waffle doll shall fall,

00:37.008 --> 00:39.998
lest you eat the
yellow dough!

00:41.502 --> 00:44.497
Bzzz!

00:46.181 --> 00:47.349
Hmm.

00:48.365 --> 00:51.174
I'll...
I'll finish this later.

00:53.467 --> 00:55.131
I'm so tired!

00:55.198 --> 01:00.107
But also... Hungry.
Maybe I should... Eat some...

01:17.062 --> 01:20.647
Huh? Uh...

01:21.292 --> 01:22.895
Aah!

01:25.206 --> 01:30.448
Huh! Hmm.
Everything's made of... Me.

01:36.259 --> 01:38.963
Pretty neat!
I bet there's like...

01:39.030 --> 01:41.819
Like a cool city or
something around here.

01:45.603 --> 01:48.991
Nice!
Jake cit-tay.

01:55.938 --> 01:58.755
- Hi!
- Oh! Uh, hi!

01:58.837 --> 02:00.376
- Jake!
- Huh?

02:00.443 --> 02:04.984
- How you doing, Jake?
- Uh, good, man. Good.

02:06.601 --> 02:09.181
Man, this place is awesome!

02:10.080 --> 02:11.186
Oh!

02:11.971 --> 02:15.694
Cool dolls. They look like
the rare, antique kind.

02:15.865 --> 02:17.585
Maybe my kids will like them.

02:17.652 --> 02:22.185
Hmm. Wonder what my kids are gonna
have for dinner. Maybe pizza?

02:23.483 --> 02:25.633
Whoa! Whoa!

02:26.988 --> 02:29.628
Some kind of Jake-quake.

02:31.451 --> 02:34.292
Eh? Is that Jake?

02:34.882 --> 02:39.085
- Hey, there... Um...
- Come on, man! It's Goose!

02:39.152 --> 02:43.348
- Your best friend! Goose!
- Oh! Uh... Of course.

02:43.415 --> 02:46.094
- Goose!
- Oh, ho, ho, hoh. Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake,

02:46.161 --> 02:48.969
Jake, ya big goof!
How long's it been...

02:49.036 --> 02:52.734
- Two, three years?
- Let's see. Uh, one,

02:52.801 --> 02:56.340
two, uh...
I've never been here.

02:57.908 --> 02:59.417
"I've never been here."

02:59.484 --> 03:01.433
You still got it, Jake.

03:02.357 --> 03:04.930
Come on! Let's get you home.
Everybody's waiting

03:04.997 --> 03:07.369
- for you at the party.
- Uh, party?

03:07.436 --> 03:11.223
No... Par-taaaaay!

03:16.777 --> 03:21.239
Jake's here! Jake!

03:27.708 --> 03:29.630
Do it again, Goose!

03:34.162 --> 03:35.888
- Hey, Jake?
- Hey, what?

03:35.955 --> 03:39.571
Now that you're back, how about
that 5 bucks you still owe me?

03:39.638 --> 03:41.626
Uh, what 5 bucks?

03:41.866 --> 03:44.092
Cheeseburger
cheesecake ring a bell?

03:44.730 --> 03:46.412
What...

03:47.627 --> 03:49.448
What is that?

03:49.515 --> 03:52.053
Oh... Oh, that!
Don't worry about that. Do not.

03:52.120 --> 03:53.744
Don't worry about that.

03:53.811 --> 03:56.741
Guess I better not worry about it.
Hmm.

03:56.851 --> 03:59.422
- I'm hungies, Goose.
- I think there's

03:59.489 --> 04:02.618
a leftover nacho basket or
something in the fridge.

04:03.993 --> 04:05.479
Just a sec.

04:11.710 --> 04:14.094
Cold-cut-and-nacho sandwiches!

04:14.161 --> 04:15.442
All right!

04:18.183 --> 04:20.866
Ahhhhh! Ow!

04:21.076 --> 04:25.896
Something's wrong, Goose. Jakey can't
eat any of these nachos.

04:25.969 --> 04:28.899
But Jakey need nachos!
Aaaaah!

04:29.331 --> 04:30.434
Mr. Jake!

04:30.506 --> 04:35.011
Mr. Jake! Mr. Jake, the mayor
wants to see you straightaway.

04:35.078 --> 04:37.693
All right, lad.
Show me the way!

04:41.152 --> 04:42.203
Jake!

04:42.271 --> 04:44.819
Hey, I got a for-real
important question.

04:44.886 --> 04:48.300
Do you like cereal
in your cake? Jake?

04:50.543 --> 04:53.608
Hmm.
Mm-nn-mm.

05:01.270 --> 05:03.123
- Mr. Mayor?
- Urchin.

05:03.190 --> 05:06.344
Thank you for your help.
Help yourself to the herring cakes.

05:06.411 --> 05:07.653
Righto!

05:08.014 --> 05:10.560
Hello, Jake!
Thanks for making it.

05:10.627 --> 05:14.326
- Heh. Okay.
- Now, look, we're at orange alert here.

05:14.471 --> 05:17.344
Below us are gathered
the city's top minds. -

05:17.411 --> 05:18.426
Hmm.

05:18.494 --> 05:20.946
And they've noticed that our
seismographic troubles have

05:21.013 --> 05:23.680
increased exponentially
since your arrival.

05:23.747 --> 05:26.822
Mayor, uh, I want to
meet these minds.

05:26.889 --> 05:31.400
- Here are some of the minds.
- Jake, we want to perform some

05:31.467 --> 05:34.413
tests on you, to discover
the cause of the quakes.

05:34.480 --> 05:36.905
There's no need.
I got it figured out.

05:36.972 --> 05:40.543
The tremors are happening
because Jake is hungry, and his

05:40.610 --> 05:43.890
stomach is growling,
and the hungrier he gets, the worse

05:43.957 --> 05:45.806
the quakes will become!

05:48.977 --> 05:51.253
- I'll prove it!
- Huh?

05:51.320 --> 05:54.401
- Mention a food item.
- Omelet!

05:54.680 --> 05:57.202
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

05:57.398 --> 05:59.128
What's in the omelet?

05:59.948 --> 06:02.679
Chili! It's a four-egg
chili omelet!

06:05.731 --> 06:08.938
- Aaaaah!
- Watch out!

06:11.818 --> 06:14.269
- Analysis, Tim.
- It's too early to say.

06:14.336 --> 06:16.995
- This evidence is anecdotal.
- Look, just let me

06:17.062 --> 06:19.864
stretch outside to get something
to eat, and the quakes will stop.

06:19.931 --> 06:23.393
- That doesn't sound very sciency.
- No, but you have my

06:23.460 --> 06:27.595
- permission to test your idea.
- <i>I don't like that idea!</i>

06:27.662 --> 06:29.611
- Huh?
- If Jake leaves,

06:29.678 --> 06:32.204
that would mean the utter
destruction of our world.

06:32.271 --> 06:35.715
I believe that
Jake is an extra-dimensional being.

06:35.782 --> 06:40.623
A "glob," if you will. Whose psychic
field holds our world together.

06:40.690 --> 06:43.089
If he leaves,
his flesh will reconfigure,

06:43.156 --> 06:47.703
and everything and everyone
here will disappear completely!

06:49.311 --> 06:54.384
Oh, Dr. Erik Addamkimson,
you're just a fringe scientist,

06:54.451 --> 06:57.660
well known to have
a crackpot of crazy theories.

06:57.727 --> 07:01.607
Hmph. Perhaps I am,
and maybe I am wrong.

07:02.681 --> 07:06.506
But are you really willing
to take that chance?

07:06.573 --> 07:10.631
- We should imprison Jake immediately!
- What?! No way!

07:10.698 --> 07:13.503
The world's not gonna end just
because I go get a bagel.

07:16.792 --> 07:18.321
Seize him!

07:18.389 --> 07:21.248
- Uh... Peace!
- Rah!

07:21.315 --> 07:25.891
Aaah!

07:26.144 --> 07:28.686
- Why?!
- Finish him!

07:28.771 --> 07:31.765
- Yaaaaah!
- Oh!

07:35.973 --> 07:39.156
Bagel...

07:39.964 --> 07:43.197
- This feels weird!
- Don't worry, everybody.

07:43.264 --> 07:47.101
I will journey to Jake's glob world,
which legend would

07:47.168 --> 07:50.793
have us believe lies beyond the
great sky hole,

07:50.860 --> 07:55.134
and bring back the food of the globs
to appease Jake's appetite,

07:55.201 --> 07:57.932
thus saving everybody.

08:01.675 --> 08:04.721
Wait! Wait!

08:06.357 --> 08:08.912
I want to go with you, son.

08:09.717 --> 08:11.468
I'm sorry, dad.

08:11.535 --> 08:13.990
You-You... You can't.
It's... It's too dangerous.

08:14.057 --> 08:17.055
Your mind is unprepared.

08:18.806 --> 08:21.602
My son...

08:37.724 --> 08:40.755
Huh? Yeah!

08:43.236 --> 08:47.118
There it is.
The sky hole!

08:53.254 --> 08:54.970
Phew!

08:55.343 --> 08:59.677
Oh, my stars!
It's just as I envisioned.

09:00.022 --> 09:04.771
Oh, mighty Jake globs,
I beseech your aid!

09:04.838 --> 09:09.420
Do you have bagels?
Hello?

09:09.787 --> 09:13.409
Hmm. Maybe those
aren't the true globs.

09:13.609 --> 09:16.630
Yeah, they're...
They're too ugly to be...

09:16.697 --> 09:19.367
N-o-o-o-o-o!

09:22.952 --> 09:27.996
I thought you'd be beautiful,
but you're not.

09:29.191 --> 09:32.952
You're hideous! Hideous!

09:40.351 --> 09:42.082
BMO, resume.

09:42.393 --> 09:44.718
Spaghetti...

09:51.658 --> 09:53.356
Don't.

09:54.374 --> 09:55.969
- Huh?
- Huh?

10:03.734 --> 10:06.370
- Hey, you're hilario...
- Oh! Ugh!

10:07.031 --> 10:10.193
Huh! Ugh!

10:10.834 --> 10:13.860
- Goose?!
- Go!

10:13.934 --> 10:17.102
But... But what if Erik
Addamkimson is right?

10:17.169 --> 10:19.781
What if you and all the
Jake peeps disappear

10:19.848 --> 10:24.167
- and I can't bring you back?
- Then you won't have to pay me

10:24.234 --> 10:26.598
- back that 5 bucks.
- But...

10:26.665 --> 10:30.497
- Ugh! Ugh!
- Go eat, Jake!

10:37.318 --> 10:38.387
Huh!

10:38.455 --> 10:39.718
What is that?

10:43.895 --> 10:49.877
Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

10:53.239 --> 10:55.132
Uh... Jake?

10:55.810 --> 10:59.496
What's going on, man?
Feeling okay?

11:00.330 --> 11:02.385
Just getting a snack, Goose.

11:02.977 --> 11:04.610
Just getting a snack.
