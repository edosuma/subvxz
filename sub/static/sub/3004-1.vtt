02:46.017 --> 02:48.186
Little pig?

02:49.771 --> 02:51.815
Little pig?

02:54.275 --> 02:56.569
Let me in.

03:15.712 --> 03:18.214
Destroy the spot!

03:25.471 --> 03:27.723
It is obnoxious.

04:00.670 --> 04:02.631
What the hell are you doing?

04:02.714 --> 04:05.341
Aaron, over here!

04:09.554 --> 04:11.931
JP and Maz, take her.

04:17.394 --> 04:19.855
What the hell is it to you?

04:19.938 --> 04:23.609
- I will not ... - Shut up!

04:23.692 --> 04:26.027
Grim hell.

04:26.111 --> 04:31.991
Good for you, otherwise I had given you another brat.

04:33.159 --> 04:36.287
So do something, or what?

04:36.370 --> 04:38.539
You so not something?

04:40.249 --> 04:42.543
Let's see.

04:46.004 --> 04:50.258
Would you appoint me if you saw me again?

04:50.342 --> 04:52.928
Reply, dammit!

04:53.011 --> 04:55.346
I did not see anyone.

05:23.873 --> 05:27.793
You must already go? We can not hug a little?

05:27.877 --> 05:30.755
I have more important things to me.

05:30.838 --> 05:32.590
Okay?

05:33.465 --> 05:37.678
- What about us? - Are you stupid? There is no "us"!

05:37.761 --> 05:40.055
You're just a bitch.

05:40.138 --> 05:44.934
Take some makeup on. You look terrible!

05:45.018 --> 05:49.605
Is it a joke? What about all the time we have spent together?

05:49.689 --> 05:54.193
I just wanted to sleep with you, Lauren, which was a waste of time.

05:54.276 --> 05:56.820
You're a miserable fuck.

05:56.904 --> 06:00.157
- What are you doing? - Evidence that.

06:00.240 --> 06:03.952
- What do you mean? - You're not frigid, like the guys think.

06:04.036 --> 06:06.037
Out from here!

06:06.121 --> 06:08.957
Hey, Charlie there?

06:09.040 --> 06:12.210
Okay? How well.

06:12.293 --> 06:15.713
Tell him that Richie rang.

06:15.797 --> 06:19.091
I'll call back in a few hours.

06:19.175 --> 06:21.886
It's a deal. Goodbye.

06:23.971 --> 06:27.224
She was crazy at the end.

06:27.307 --> 06:31.686
Yes, she let me take her in the ass and everything.

06:31.770 --> 06:35.690
It fits, Rob! It fits.

06:35.774 --> 06:37.775
Okay.

06:37.859 --> 06:42.029
- Tough. You should see this place. - What are you doing?

06:42.113 --> 06:46.951
- I am leaving now. - Get out of here, I said.

06:47.034 --> 06:49.078
Who is it?

06:49.161 --> 06:52.414
- Your sister? - It's my mom.

06:52.497 --> 06:55.417
She is otherwise delicious.

06:55.500 --> 06:58.878
- Invite her next time. - Get!

06:58.962 --> 07:01.422
Be nice now.

07:02.799 --> 07:05.843
Otherwise I will have to be bad.

07:22.651 --> 07:28.656
- That took a while. - It does not go in the pants for me.

07:28.740 --> 07:32.326
What are you talking about? It does this when not on me.

07:34.537 --> 07:36.372
Come on!

07:36.455 --> 07:39.583
On time as always.

07:39.666 --> 07:45.213
As always, I keep my promises, and as always you are not ready.

07:45.297 --> 07:49.342
Always let a man waiting. That's what I learned.

07:56.599 --> 07:59.727
Talked I just, or what?

07:59.810 --> 08:04.231
Why will you know what I did to the bitch?

08:04.314 --> 08:09.903
- Would you fuck her? - No, I just like her.

08:09.986 --> 08:14.741
- If you are with her ... - No, dammit.

08:15.950 --> 08:21.164
But it would be fun to see you fuck. I'm writing just for her.

08:30.130 --> 08:32.758
Sorry about before. When looking at 22 o'clock.

08:35.927 --> 08:39.304
- I am at home! - Hi Mom!

08:39.389 --> 08:43.308
He's my brother. He is not a royal, Carmen.

08:43.393 --> 08:49.690
You asked me to arrange birthday - party. The best in Spain.

08:49.774 --> 08:54.403
Thanks, that sounds great, but also very expensive.

08:54.486 --> 08:58.865
I know how much Charlie means to you.

08:58.949 --> 09:05.246
And is not it amazing, I can not take myself so well paid.

09:10.918 --> 09:14.422
Who wants to fuck little tonight?

09:17.967 --> 09:21.595
- Do you think Lauren? - Giantess must be educated a little.

09:21.678 --> 09:24.848
So you will therefore not have her?

09:24.931 --> 09:29.102
As brothers we share.

09:29.185 --> 09:33.940
Are you afraid that others will see your small dick?

09:37.401 --> 09:42.615
- He's probably not full and misses the plane? - He is not a total Lush.

09:42.698 --> 09:44.825
He was not even at the pub.

09:44.908 --> 09:50.831
I'll call Dover Castle. Is he not, I give dinner.

09:50.914 --> 09:55.585
For I am your customer, so I assumed that you would offer dinner.

09:55.668 --> 10:00.214
The best safecracker in the industry. He was the king.

10:00.298 --> 10:03.509
Dover Castle. How can I help?

10:03.592 --> 10:07.471
He's here, but he is running with his anecdotes.

10:07.554 --> 10:10.849
Mr. Archer? Mr. Archer?

10:10.933 --> 10:14.603
- Mr. Archer? - I'm telling on later.

10:21.818 --> 10:25.613
- Hello? - Mr. Archer, here is the their brother.

10:29.867 --> 10:34.913
- Charlie ... - Richie! How are you?

10:34.997 --> 10:41.169
You let someone else call for you? Are you too tired right now?

10:41.253 --> 10:43.838
So you just came by the pub?

10:43.922 --> 10:48.843
It is not a pub anymore. It's a fucking bistro!

10:48.926 --> 10:52.555
You have to be lucky if you can get a drink.

10:52.638 --> 10:54.765
The waiter says:

10:54.849 --> 11:02.689
"The house specialty is duebryst with beetroot chutney."

11:02.773 --> 11:06.610
Or goose liver. Do you know how to make it?

11:06.693 --> 11:12.699
They stick a tube down their throat and stopfodrer them mad, -

11:12.782 --> 11:18.162
- like when force fed in jail until the liver rupture!

11:18.245 --> 11:20.289
It is called "haute cuisine"!

11:20.372 --> 11:24.293
- I miss you, Charlie. - You too.

11:24.376 --> 11:27.754
Now go home and lie a little.

11:27.838 --> 11:31.258
- You're not young anymore. - You too!

11:31.341 --> 11:35.512
- And please do not be late for the plane. - Never in my life!

11:35.595 --> 11:38.139
It was cozy.

11:38.222 --> 11:40.766
Then there is trouble.

11:40.850 --> 11:44.812
It was my brother. He asked me to go home.

11:44.895 --> 11:49.358
Did he say that? These are new times.

11:49.441 --> 11:54.154
It is, but it is not necessarily improved.

11:54.946 --> 11:57.449
How's your brother?

11:57.532 --> 12:02.745
He still goes in miniskirt. I am joking. He's fine.

12:02.829 --> 12:08.793
I have not seen him in 30 years.

12:08.876 --> 12:14.590
At that time I crush on him, that when he was younger.

12:14.673 --> 12:18.802
Drop it, Charlie. You're too old for me.

12:18.885 --> 12:22.305
But you're still fantastic.

12:22.389 --> 12:24.974
You can get his number.

12:27.560 --> 12:32.898
You know what? I'm afraid to call him.

12:32.982 --> 12:36.902
Afraid? It's not a problem.

12:36.986 --> 12:40.572
Then you go out with me instead.

12:40.656 --> 12:45.702
- I do not know how to do it. - I can teach you.

12:54.544 --> 12:57.963
Oh boy? You look nice!

12:58.047 --> 13:00.925
Come, I will show you something.

13:05.387 --> 13:08.724
I have a surprise for you.

13:18.983 --> 13:24.029
- What happens here? - I will introduce you to the guys.

13:26.073 --> 13:28.283
Proper.

13:31.620 --> 13:34.164
See you later, honey.

13:44.549 --> 13:48.302
I am going home now.

13:48.386 --> 13:50.971
Bye, princess.

13:51.055 --> 13:56.435
Behave yourselves now properly and keep you from the young boys. See you!

14:06.444 --> 14:09.113
Wait until it is your turn.

14:10.990 --> 14:15.161
Come on, Dean. Then sprayed.

14:15.244 --> 14:17.579
I do not really know.

14:17.663 --> 14:23.210
What do you mean? Pull dress up and fuck her!

14:28.256 --> 14:31.593
What the hell are you doing?

14:31.676 --> 14:34.804
Slip, Grandpa. Mind your own business.

14:34.887 --> 14:38.265
The goddamn bitch bit me!

14:40.809 --> 14:45.856
If I were you, I would not make it there.

14:45.939 --> 14:49.484
Fuck the old!

14:49.568 --> 14:52.028
I will not say it again.

14:52.112 --> 14:57.784
I cut off the jaw of the next snot young people who ask me to fuck off.

15:00.286 --> 15:02.121
Fuck off.

15:05.416 --> 15:08.919
Was it good? I hope so.

15:09.002 --> 15:11.296
Tickled it?

15:12.756 --> 15:17.135
- There fucked you up. - No, you fucked up.

15:17.218 --> 15:22.724
- I do not think. - Do you think you're tough? Then came the way.

15:22.807 --> 15:25.059
How it works no longer.

15:25.143 --> 15:28.687
Fucking assholes!

15:28.771 --> 15:33.776
You're too cowardly to fight man to man, damn snot kids!

15:33.859 --> 15:38.697
I hate that sound! It sounds like a rat piss.

15:51.083 --> 15:53.753
Do you want to fight man to man?

15:54.712 --> 15:57.381
It's about time...

15:57.464 --> 16:02.594
- ... that you take action. - Shut up, dammit!

16:08.516 --> 16:12.562
Want some more? You fucking pussy!

16:14.063 --> 16:16.565
What the hell is wrong with you?

16:17.983 --> 16:21.654
What the hell do you say? What do you say now?

16:25.115 --> 16:27.200
Asshole!

16:41.047 --> 16:44.758
You little shit, show some respect.

16:44.842 --> 16:48.303
- Take the damn cap! - Shut up, bitch!

16:48.387 --> 16:50.430
Become adults!

17:11.325 --> 17:14.619
How did you know the deceased?

17:14.703 --> 17:18.915
I knew him as everyone else in the neighborhood.

17:18.999 --> 17:23.002
Why? Why all knew him.

17:23.086 --> 17:26.839
Do not you know Charlie and Richie Archer?

17:26.923 --> 17:31.552
- So you are one. Are you part time? - No I...

17:31.636 --> 17:34.638
I'm a detective.

17:34.722 --> 17:39.601
I would not call myself if I were you.

17:39.685 --> 17:45.857
- Do you know who Kray -tvillingerne was? - But they were not even brothers.

17:45.941 --> 17:49.903
- He was like them. - It was Charlie and Richie place.

17:49.986 --> 17:53.698
- The drive instead and took a share. - Literally.

17:53.781 --> 18:00.412
At that time, not harassed on the street, or even worse.

18:00.496 --> 18:06.251
- We do our best. - Oh yes, budget cuts, etc..

18:06.335 --> 18:11.548
I can not remember when I last saw a cop on the street.

18:11.631 --> 18:16.261
- Mrs. Davies ... - Miss! Had you read the report ...

18:16.344 --> 18:20.181
... you would know it, detective.

18:20.264 --> 18:25.477
When you said that Charlie Archer was murdered, suggested you something.

18:25.561 --> 18:29.857
- So you're the murderer? - No, but it was E2 -berenstain.

18:29.940 --> 18:35.070
- How can you be so sure? - They came from the same alley!

18:35.153 --> 18:38.823
I recognized most of them.

18:38.907 --> 18:44.328
They are like cockroaches crawling around. They must be eradicated.

18:44.412 --> 18:48.582
- It is best not to say so. - Why?

18:48.666 --> 18:52.503
They try the to exterminate us.

18:52.586 --> 18:55.672
Our society, our lifestyle and ...

18:55.756 --> 18:58.550
Do you intend to protect them?

18:58.633 --> 19:03.304
- We can not do anything without evidence. - Evidence, of course ...

19:03.388 --> 19:06.224
Did you find anything at the scene?

19:06.307 --> 19:10.811
Fingerprints, watch movies.

19:10.895 --> 19:14.773
Or other clues?

19:14.857 --> 19:18.110
So you someone attack him?

19:18.193 --> 19:24.699
- So you think he was murdered? - No, but it was E2 -berenstain.

19:24.783 --> 19:29.329
It would never have happened in the past.

19:29.412 --> 19:32.623
These are new times -

19:32.707 --> 19:38.504
- but I will follow up and pulls E2 -berenstain in for questioning.

19:38.587 --> 19:42.174
Oh, I'm relieved now ...

19:42.257 --> 19:45.719
- May I go? - Thank you for your time.

19:45.802 --> 19:50.015
You're welcome. I hope you keep your word.

19:50.098 --> 19:54.602
For a good man died in the night.

20:01.525 --> 20:07.865
The interview of Miss Lizzy Davies ends at 02:37.

20:10.158 --> 20:15.038
A good man does not commit arson, robbery and murder.

20:24.213 --> 20:27.508
- Hello? - Mr. Archer?

20:27.591 --> 20:32.012
- You're not telemarketer? - No ...

20:32.096 --> 20:37.726
No, Lizzy Davies. You probably do not remember me.

20:37.809 --> 20:40.270
Lizzy Davies.

20:41.104 --> 20:43.481
Torrance Street 237.

20:43.565 --> 20:47.276
Long brown hair and beautiful blue eyes.

20:47.360 --> 20:51.238
Thin, or actually quite skinny.

20:51.322 --> 20:54.366
You remember me obviously.

20:54.450 --> 20:57.286
Yes, I remember all.

20:59.830 --> 21:02.082
Hello?

21:02.165 --> 21:07.629
- Mr. Archer ... - Richie. Where did you get this number?

21:07.712 --> 21:12.175
Yes, it is such that I have bad ...

21:13.426 --> 21:16.971
No, it's actually terrible news.

21:17.054 --> 21:22.768
It's the first thing you say to me after 30 years. That does not sound promising.

21:25.145 --> 21:27.689
Hello? He you of, Lizzy?

21:27.773 --> 21:32.444
You sound upset or scared or both.

21:32.527 --> 21:35.280
Do not be afraid.

21:35.363 --> 21:40.952
I am no longer that you remember me.

21:41.035 --> 21:44.663
Believe me. You can trust me.

21:44.747 --> 21:51.169
Everybody knew. It was one of the things that I liked about you.

21:53.130 --> 22:00.094
Now, Lizzy Davies, why are you calling middle of the night after so many years?

22:34.919 --> 22:37.504
Are you sure?

22:37.588 --> 22:43.051
Miss Davies said she saw E2 - gang nearby. There we have them.

22:43.135 --> 22:46.388
- And the one who ... - What's with him?

22:46.471 --> 22:49.307
You will find out.

22:49.390 --> 22:55.354
Those kids are not killers. They are just great in his mouth.

22:55.438 --> 23:00.568
- Do you have a better idea? - A round in the neighborhood maybe?

23:01.443 --> 23:04.613
What was he doing in the alley?

23:04.696 --> 23:08.241
He probably should piss and was assaulted.

23:08.325 --> 23:11.703
But why? The wallet was still there.

23:12.954 --> 23:16.833
- Have they found his brother? - Spanish police are on the case.

23:16.916 --> 23:22.088
The meeting I do not look forward to. Come, let us do some snooping.

23:36.643 --> 23:40.521
- I is shown cops? - Have we met before?

23:43.232 --> 23:47.862
- You looking for me? - We just want to talk a little.

23:47.945 --> 23:51.031
And what if I will not?

23:52.991 --> 23:56.912
I understand what you mean by milf ...

23:56.995 --> 24:03.668
Vi kan tage det på stationen, men jeg
ved, at du ikke vil i strafferegistret.

24:06.254 --> 24:11.842
Film det her. Panserne er jo
kendt for at bure uskyldige inde.

24:26.731 --> 24:31.444
- Hvad fanden vil I?
- Jeg ved, hvorfor du er ustraffet.

24:31.527 --> 24:34.906
Jeg er ikke stikker længere.
Det er slut med det.

24:34.989 --> 24:40.578
Jeg er ikke imponeret over måden
min forgænger håndterede det på.

24:40.661 --> 24:43.413
Er du jaloux over,
at han blev forfremmet?

24:43.497 --> 24:47.709
Det er dårligt arbejde at se igennem
fingre med dine forbrydelser.

24:47.793 --> 24:52.338
I fik et par større fisk på krogen,
så alle er tilfredse.

24:52.422 --> 24:56.718
- Bortset fra dine ofre.
- Det er slut nu.

24:56.801 --> 25:01.138
Du skal ikke glo på mig!
Jeg fortryder, at jeg hjalp jer svin.

25:01.222 --> 25:05.226
En gang til og jeg slår dig ned
selvom jeg bliver filmet.

25:05.309 --> 25:09.688
- Hvor var du i aftes ved 22 -tiden?
- Det kan jeg ikke huske.

25:09.771 --> 25:13.859
- Tænk efter.
- Vi så en film sammen.

25:13.942 --> 25:18.655
- Hvilken film?
- Aner det ikke, bare en film.

25:18.738 --> 25:21.074
- Hvor?
- Hos DK.

25:21.157 --> 25:25.119
One of your signalement was seen outside Dover Castle.

25:25.202 --> 25:27.997
I was with the guys all night.

25:28.080 --> 25:33.752
We hoped you'd say that, for the witness also described them.

25:33.836 --> 25:37.798
- An old man was assaulted. - It is a dangerous area.

25:37.881 --> 25:43.052
He died, Aaron, as the culprit goes in for murder.

25:43.136 --> 25:47.306
And he escapes not by gossip.

25:47.390 --> 25:49.892
Not again.

25:51.727 --> 25:54.355
Are we finished?

25:54.438 --> 25:59.484
- If I hear anything ... - So, be a good citizen.

25:59.568 --> 26:03.280
- See you, Aaron. - Much like sweet.

26:06.032 --> 26:10.286
The little shit ... He probably has some grass on it.

26:10.370 --> 26:15.583
It's not worth the paperwork. We go to the crime scene again.

26:28.345 --> 26:30.764
What happened?

26:30.847 --> 26:33.099
The old man is dead.

26:33.183 --> 26:37.103
- Damn ... - It's good. He deserved it.

26:37.186 --> 26:41.899
- She said that someone saw us. - She just fishing.

26:41.982 --> 26:46.320
- Unless the old woman talked. - No, she knows better than that.

26:46.403 --> 26:49.114
There was not the other.

26:51.658 --> 26:53.577
Yes, it was there.

26:53.660 --> 26:55.954
Bak me up.

26:56.037 --> 26:58.373
Come on.

28:09.564 --> 28:11.816
Hello, Roy.

28:11.900 --> 28:15.737
- Good to see you again. - You too, buddy.

28:18.656 --> 28:20.783
I am sorry.

28:26.747 --> 28:32.586
- sikket hole! It deserved he will not. - Sorry, but I live here actually.

28:38.925 --> 28:41.803
Unfortunately cordoned off here.

28:42.428 --> 28:45.681
- Not anymore. - Leave it.

28:46.766 --> 28:51.311
Sound a little more convincing next time.

28:52.438 --> 28:54.815
You were not credible.

28:55.649 --> 28:58.068
If we assume that ...

28:58.151 --> 29:04.490
- Hello, this is a crime scene. - Move. I will talk with the boss.

29:05.408 --> 29:08.786
- So this is where it happened? - Mr. Archer.

29:08.870 --> 29:13.207
- You is not entirely without merit. - I looked in criminal album.

29:13.290 --> 29:19.421
It's good to know that you are doing something to find my brother's killers.

29:19.504 --> 29:24.175
Detective Taylor. I am investigating.

29:24.259 --> 29:30.056
- I'm sorry about your brother. - Thanks. What do you know?

29:30.139 --> 29:35.102
- We do not know why he was here ... - Or who killed him.

29:35.186 --> 29:38.189
It is too early in the investigation.

29:40.816 --> 29:45.320
- It was cozy, inspector. - Mr. Archer!

29:45.404 --> 29:52.577
I know your reputation, and there will certainly be friction, -

29:52.660 --> 29:58.040
- let me make one thing clear: If you interfering in my investigation -

29:58.124 --> 30:02.086
- so I get boxed yourself in.

30:09.968 --> 30:15.890
Now I understand the saying: "Him I will not meet in a dark alley."

30:28.110 --> 30:31.280
- Lauren! Are you okay? - Okay?

30:31.363 --> 30:37.369
- Fuck you! Would you rape me? - I did not know what he had.

30:37.452 --> 30:40.538
- And I ... - It was a mistake.

30:40.622 --> 30:46.961
He is on the way. He thinks you will squeal. If you do, he turns you down.

30:47.044 --> 30:51.257
In him the old man. I do not want that something happens to you.

30:51.340 --> 30:53.759
Fuck, here he comes!

30:56.220 --> 30:59.932
Lauren? Lauren!

31:00.015 --> 31:03.894
I know that you are there. Do not just ignore me.

31:04.603 --> 31:10.316
The boys are disappointed that you slipped so early the other night.

31:10.400 --> 31:15.112
I told them that you're just a little bitch!

31:15.196 --> 31:20.075
Now listen carefully.

31:21.952 --> 31:26.331
The guys are my family.

31:27.833 --> 31:31.169
They are my hungry pack of wolves.

31:31.252 --> 31:33.755
Do you understand what I mean?

31:33.838 --> 31:39.802
And you're just a little grisefisse.

31:39.885 --> 31:44.139
So if you do not keep your little fucking mouth shut ...

31:47.851 --> 31:50.437
Guess what happens next.

31:50.520 --> 31:53.481
Then I breathe and breathe -

31:53.565 --> 31:59.112
- and burn down the house while you and your bloody mother sleeping!

32:31.684 --> 32:33.394
Hello, Lizzy.

32:33.477 --> 32:38.941
E2 -berenstain have no respect for us because nobody does anything about them.

32:39.024 --> 32:43.361
Cops are either just stupid or fucking scared.

32:43.445 --> 32:47.615
- It was different ... - In the old days, you mean?

32:47.699 --> 32:53.454
At that time dared to walk the streets. If my father were still alive ...

32:53.538 --> 32:57.124
I wish there was something I could do.

32:57.208 --> 33:02.838
Poor old Charlie ... He was a good man, even though he ...

33:02.921 --> 33:07.425
- Although he was a crook? - Yes exactly.

33:07.509 --> 33:09.803
Listen up...

33:09.886 --> 33:14.724
It's probably best if the police do not get to know that I have been here.

33:14.807 --> 33:18.186
It just gets so complicated then.

33:18.269 --> 33:21.897
Who had thought that you would visit?

33:21.981 --> 33:27.444
- Jeg ville ønske, jeg var 40 år yngre.
- I lige måde.

33:27.528 --> 33:32.032
Ikke på den måde. Jeg mente bare...

33:32.115 --> 33:38.079
Jeg ville føle mig mere sikker,
hvis du var her. Det ville vi alle.

33:38.163 --> 33:44.710
- Undskyld at jeg ikke stoppede dem.
- Du kunne ikke have stoppet dem.

33:44.794 --> 33:49.506
Det siger du,
men en gammel mand gjorde det.

33:52.384 --> 33:55.554
- Op med dig!
- Hør efter.

33:55.637 --> 33:57.556
Hold kæft!

33:59.975 --> 34:03.853
Min nevø fandt det i morges.

34:03.937 --> 34:09.525
Det lå på en lukket side, som ikke
kan findes med en normal browser.

34:09.609 --> 34:14.446
- Jeg aner ikke, hvad hun siger.
- Jeg er ikke ligefrem ekspert.

34:14.530 --> 34:19.451
- Kender din nevø dem?
- Nej, men det gør jeg.

34:19.534 --> 34:22.829
- Skal jeg tage et screenshot?
- Et hvad?

34:22.913 --> 34:26.666
Man zoomer ind på ansigterne
og printer dem ud.

34:26.750 --> 34:31.963
- Vi kan også give det til politiet.
- Nej, vi beholder det for os selv.

34:32.045 --> 34:35.007
Jeg vil hellere selv ordne det.

34:35.091 --> 34:39.762
Fiks det der skærmhalløj for mig.
Altså, ansigterne.

34:39.844 --> 34:42.848
Se lige her.

34:42.931 --> 34:46.268
Flere videoer fra den samme bruger.

34:46.351 --> 34:48.812
Geez, poor girl ...

34:48.895 --> 34:54.525
- That's where Charlie was killed. - I know where she works.

34:59.488 --> 35:04.994
- Hi, can I help you? - Yes. I need a little information.

35:05.077 --> 35:08.997
- About what? - About the alley at 10th Street.

35:09.831 --> 35:13.210
- I'm not. - Yes, I think, you are.

35:13.293 --> 35:16.963
You must have got hold of the wrong person.

35:22.218 --> 35:24.804
Do not try to cheat me.

35:26.680 --> 35:31.143
- Are you okay, Lauren? - Everything okay, thanks. Not true?

35:31.226 --> 35:36.189
- Who are you? You are not a cop. - I am not.

35:36.273 --> 35:39.025
But I would still like to have some answers.

35:39.985 --> 35:45.198
The man who died when he helped you, my brother.

35:45.281 --> 35:47.241
Lauren?

35:47.325 --> 35:49.827
Yes, it's okay.

35:49.910 --> 35:53.205
I can not speak here.

35:53.289 --> 35:57.835
It makes me really sorry about your brother. I could not do anything.

35:57.918 --> 36:03.298
I know. I do not care why you have maintained close.

36:03.381 --> 36:07.635
I just want their names. Did you know them?

36:07.719 --> 36:12.557
- In that case, give me their names. - I did not know them.

36:12.640 --> 36:15.810
- I was attacked. - I do not believe you.

36:15.893 --> 36:19.730
- If they find out ... - Their names.

36:19.813 --> 36:23.567
I was with Aaron, who I thought was my boyfriend.

36:23.650 --> 36:28.196
- What is his last name? - I do not know.

36:28.280 --> 36:32.825
Do not you know what your guy is called? What happened?

36:32.909 --> 36:36.829
I was just trying to fit in. I thought he liked me.

36:36.913 --> 36:40.333
- How is he involved? - He is the band leader.

36:40.416 --> 36:43.877
They do everything he says.

36:43.961 --> 36:48.465
- Okay. Did you recognize others? - Yes.

36:48.549 --> 36:51.968
Maz. I think he has gone at my school.

36:52.052 --> 36:55.930
- Would you mind ...? - Not a word to anyone.

36:56.014 --> 37:01.894
- Be careful. They are many. - I believe in quality, not quantity.

37:01.978 --> 37:05.481
You should be back at work.

37:08.275 --> 37:10.486
Your brother was a good man.

37:10.569 --> 37:15.615
- He saved me. - Do you know what he would have said?

37:15.699 --> 37:21.454
"Stop trying to circumvent the little buggers, Lauren."

37:21.538 --> 37:26.959
I apologize for the language ... Life is too short for that.

37:55.736 --> 37:58.447
It seems that we get a little help.

38:01.909 --> 38:08.081
I appreciate the gesture, but I do not want you involve you -

38:08.164 --> 38:11.918
- for this will be bloody.

38:17.840 --> 38:19.634
What?

38:19.717 --> 38:23.804
What? He will of course have our help!

38:23.887 --> 38:28.267
Kun you, Arthur Bennett -

38:28.350 --> 38:34.230
- would dare to make fun of my brother's funeral!

38:38.943 --> 38:41.737
You know how I am, Richie.

38:41.821 --> 38:45.491
Either amuse myself or else I am furious.

38:45.574 --> 38:52.039
- Are not you getting too old? - I'm fucking not old!

38:53.540 --> 38:56.460
Do not worry, boys. I am just kidding.

38:56.543 --> 39:02.215
Good to see you again, Arthur, and you, Butch. How are you?

39:02.298 --> 39:06.302
We have bored us a little, since you ran from here in the last century.

39:06.385 --> 39:09.138
But it will be displayed turned on.

39:09.221 --> 39:13.809
Well, what is the status, Richie?

39:13.892 --> 39:17.604
Judging from the video is the six.

39:17.688 --> 39:20.232
Lede small pig dogs.

39:20.315 --> 39:27.071
I would like to hear them call their mother before they die.

39:27.155 --> 39:31.784
It sounds funny. I find the knives forward.

39:31.868 --> 39:36.539
- Where do we find the little ...? - Butch, so simple it is not.

39:36.622 --> 39:41.376
They are part of a gang, so they can be quite so many.

39:41.460 --> 39:44.671
And they have age on their side.

39:45.714 --> 39:48.883
Therefore, we must be smart.

39:49.884 --> 39:53.096
Today it is Charlie's day -

39:53.179 --> 39:56.808
- but tomorrow dragons we are at war.

39:56.891 --> 39:59.518
For Charlie.

40:18.536 --> 40:22.540
What the hell are you doing? I do not want it there.

40:22.623 --> 40:24.875
Yoko!

40:42.183 --> 40:45.853
Sell ​​it. Back it.

40:50.649 --> 40:53.277
Slip so.

40:58.282 --> 41:01.576
- Someone asks after you. - cop?

41:01.660 --> 41:07.332
No, an old man. He questioned Lauren about the dead.

41:07.415 --> 41:11.752
There are some pricks who need to learn to shut up.

41:28.476 --> 41:31.062
So.

41:31.146 --> 41:33.147
Madame...

41:33.231 --> 41:37.818
Thanks. There are not many gentlemen left.

41:37.902 --> 41:42.698
I know. I feel that I am up against superior forces.

41:44.742 --> 41:51.331
It was a good time. Now they know nothing about romance.

41:51.414 --> 41:56.294
They close just a lot of shit out!

42:01.883 --> 42:05.344
- Give me a beer, Butch. - Here you go.

42:12.059 --> 42:14.978
- Liver? - Well spotted.

42:15.062 --> 42:19.816
I've chopped part in pieces, so I should know.

42:23.528 --> 42:26.364
It is a private event.

42:26.447 --> 42:28.991
Detective!

42:29.075 --> 42:31.952
Sorry, we interfere.

42:32.036 --> 42:38.500
We did not have your contact info, but we knew that you would be here.

42:38.583 --> 42:42.462
- Can we talk in private? - Of course. Over here.

42:43.421 --> 42:48.843
- How's the investigation? - No one will say anything.

42:48.926 --> 42:51.304
Some things never change.

42:51.387 --> 42:55.724
- I will find the guilty. - Well, I will too.

42:55.808 --> 42:58.394
It's my job, not yours.

42:58.477 --> 43:02.022
- I understand your loss. - I do not think.

43:02.105 --> 43:05.067
I do. Believe me.

43:05.150 --> 43:07.903
What do you know about loss?

43:09.279 --> 43:15.159
I am both widowed mother, and I have a pretty stressful job.

43:15.243 --> 43:21.290
It would make my life quite hard if you took the law into their own hands.

43:21.373 --> 43:26.503
- I do not take the law into their own hands. - I regret your loss.

43:26.587 --> 43:30.465
But I want you to take back to Spain as soon as possible.

43:30.549 --> 43:33.593
I do not take the law into their own hands.

43:38.848 --> 43:42.143
Is it a good idea to do this?

43:42.226 --> 43:45.855
Why not? Charlie loved this place as a child.

43:45.938 --> 43:48.691
And as he grew older.

43:48.774 --> 43:53.320
He is not the first we've thrown in the water here.

43:53.403 --> 43:58.074
Dumped we shooter here after we killed ... What was his name?

43:58.158 --> 44:04.288
MacVey. I wish I could dig the pig up and kill him again.

44:04.372 --> 44:06.999
Good to see you, guys.

44:07.625 --> 44:11.337
- For the good times. - And the bad.

44:11.420 --> 44:14.590
If only the Thames could talk ...

44:15.799 --> 44:19.302
This is not the Thames. It's just a fucking channel.

44:22.931 --> 44:26.559
It is the perfect place no matter what.

44:29.771 --> 44:31.731
See you, bro!

44:36.068 --> 44:39.071
Well then. Let's get started.

44:56.379 --> 45:00.341
- Hey, Jack. It was a long time ago. - Hey, Richie.

45:06.138 --> 45:08.765
I've heard of it with Charlie.

45:08.849 --> 45:11.643
A sad story.

45:11.726 --> 45:15.855
- I'm not crazy about your decor. - Bloody brats!

45:15.939 --> 45:22.653
No respect. They do not just steal. They also smashing everything.

45:22.737 --> 45:26.073
- I need your help. - Forget it.

45:26.157 --> 45:31.328
- Those days are over. - I thought so too, but here we are.

45:31.411 --> 45:36.124
What did the police? Gave you the number to the victim line?

45:36.208 --> 45:41.045
- What do you think? - You did well not even to them?

45:41.129 --> 45:46.008
- You have no confidence in the old friends? - Not so.

45:46.092 --> 45:52.139
Or are you afraid that they will be freed immediately?

45:53.432 --> 45:56.310
You are in good shape. Well maintained.

45:56.393 --> 46:00.981
Tanning and five kilograms overweight thanks to the Mediterranean.

46:01.064 --> 46:06.361
- I should even be gone. - You were here for her sake.

46:06.444 --> 46:12.116
All the money I earned on our business, went to her.

46:12.199 --> 46:15.911
To what avail? No.

46:15.995 --> 46:21.291
- You have to die at some point. - Those who are left dying prematurely.

46:21.375 --> 46:24.961
- Do you see anything to them? - As much as I can.

46:25.045 --> 46:29.883
They give me hope that the next generation will not be like animals.

46:29.966 --> 46:33.469
You are indeed an old alarmist.

46:35.346 --> 46:41.018
I need information from your blue-clad friends.

46:42.102 --> 46:44.480
What do you need?

46:44.563 --> 46:49.860
- Reduce the number that is on the case. - It is probably already done.

46:49.943 --> 46:55.240
And then I need information about a few thugs, Aaron and Maz.

46:55.323 --> 46:58.284
Why should they listen to me?

46:58.368 --> 47:03.372
A former general has well little to say.

47:03.456 --> 47:06.750
What should I say? "Do me a favor."

47:06.834 --> 47:11.588
It's not my problem as long as you just said something.

47:11.672 --> 47:14.591
I gave you money in your pocket.

47:14.674 --> 47:19.804
And you and your boys did not smoke in. Everyone got something out of it.

47:19.888 --> 47:24.017
Yes, but there was more to it than that.

47:24.100 --> 47:29.522
Do you remember Billy Morgan and Pat Corrigan? What was that Terry was called?

47:29.605 --> 47:33.942
- Richards. - Exact! They are still dead.

47:34.026 --> 47:37.154
And who took over their territory?

47:37.237 --> 47:43.535
The real headline was: "The police ordered the murder of gangster kings."

47:43.618 --> 47:48.081
I know where all the bodies are buried.

47:48.164 --> 47:53.544
- Well, I thought I would have help. - What makes you think that?

47:53.627 --> 47:59.341
Those brats crap after all on you and takes over the entire East End.

47:59.425 --> 48:02.970
It is frankly embarrassing.

48:05.180 --> 48:08.850
See what you can do. I find out for yourself.

48:31.288 --> 48:36.709
The little buggers do not scare me. They are not people.

48:36.793 --> 48:40.755
- What happens? - Richie, you must fix this.

48:40.838 --> 48:46.385
- Did they hurt you? They touched you? - I've had enough now!

48:46.468 --> 48:51.390
If you jump over them, we help all together.

48:51.473 --> 48:54.726
Just to fix this shit!

48:54.810 --> 48:57.020
Are you okay?

49:04.110 --> 49:06.946
Shut up, or E2 shut your mouth.

49:12.910 --> 49:14.953
I am home!

49:15.037 --> 49:19.875
- Hey darling. How was your day? - As always.

49:19.958 --> 49:24.254
Are you okay? You're not quite yourself.

49:24.337 --> 49:26.631
You're not sick?

49:26.714 --> 49:29.425
It's probably not something with a guy?

49:29.509 --> 49:33.888
No mom. I am not sick, and it's not a guy.

49:33.971 --> 49:38.350
- I am just tired. - I know you better than that.

49:38.434 --> 49:43.230
If anything, you can come to me. No secrets.

49:44.189 --> 49:48.318
No secrets. Everything's okay, Mom.

49:48.401 --> 49:50.528
I promise.

49:50.612 --> 49:56.534
Okay, but I'm the cop, so I always know when something is wrong.

50:12.966 --> 50:16.553
- It's not just the Mediterranean. - Not just.

50:16.636 --> 50:20.932
It has its charm, and it's worth fighting for.

50:21.015 --> 50:26.854
My old colleague got this to disappear from the evidence.

50:27.771 --> 50:32.192
- Is it Charlie? - I thought you wanted it.

50:39.699 --> 50:45.163
- Do you suffer still from that? - It is a medical condition.

50:45.246 --> 50:49.542
It's everything I could find. Aaron is completely clean.

50:49.625 --> 50:54.421
But there is an address of Maz. A typical bully.

50:54.505 --> 50:59.676
Arrested for the murder of a pensioner. An old war veteran.

50:59.760 --> 51:02.804
Unfortunately the case is not in court.

51:02.887 --> 51:05.765
It shall go to pay for.

51:24.574 --> 51:29.412
Hello, boys. Sit shown in a precarious situation.

51:29.496 --> 51:34.667
We can make it easy or hard for you.

51:34.750 --> 51:37.253
What do you choose?

51:37.336 --> 51:43.675
Is it a joke? Why are you dressed like the guys in "Reservoir Dogs"?

51:43.759 --> 51:48.555
Should it scare me? It's ridiculous!

51:48.638 --> 51:52.809
No, it's Halloween. They are dressed as a boy band.

51:52.892 --> 51:55.854
Release me, I promise that I will survive.

51:55.937 --> 51:59.148
How thoughtful. Where is Aaron?

51:59.232 --> 52:02.943
- Fuck you! - Let us free.

52:03.027 --> 52:07.823
Maybe we should tell the young men why they are here.

52:07.906 --> 52:12.744
Now hear this: Recently, my brother trampled to death -

52:12.828 --> 52:15.830
- and at least one of you is involved.

52:15.914 --> 52:19.000
- Maybe you both. - Maybe.

52:19.084 --> 52:23.921
And now one of you or both of you -

52:24.005 --> 52:26.382
- get payed.

52:26.465 --> 52:30.845
But not until I know where Aaron is.

52:30.928 --> 52:34.556
You do not know what awaits you.

52:34.640 --> 52:40.604
We are part of E2 -berenstain. You know what that means? That you are dead.

52:41.187 --> 52:48.152
I've been close to death so many times, like my friends here.

52:48.236 --> 52:54.283
- We do not care about you. - It ought ye would not be.

52:54.366 --> 52:57.202
Four old men?

52:57.286 --> 53:01.790
We know that you like murdering old men. Pensioners.

53:01.873 --> 53:06.670
He refused to give us his medal, so he got deserved.

53:06.753 --> 53:11.257
It is nothing compared to the pain I must expose you to.

53:11.341 --> 53:14.969
You want to talk about pain? See him there.

53:15.052 --> 53:19.640
He was the executioner earlier, one of the best.

53:19.723 --> 53:23.602
He has the ability to see, when people are lying.

53:23.685 --> 53:25.979
I shake with fear.

53:26.063 --> 53:32.777
Unfortunately, it is true, Leroy, but I will find out soon enough.

53:32.861 --> 53:35.113
Can you see him here?

53:35.196 --> 53:37.949
He is a so-called torpedo.

53:38.032 --> 53:42.328
If you are smart, so do him angry.

53:42.411 --> 53:45.247
Release me and I'll let you live.

53:45.331 --> 53:48.917
He is lying. He will kill us.

53:49.001 --> 53:53.380
And then we Butch there. You know why he's called?

53:53.463 --> 53:57.384
Because his face looks like the ass of a dog?

54:01.971 --> 54:05.433
- It's one of the reasons. - Nonsense!

54:05.516 --> 54:09.812
No, it is an abbreviation of Butcher.

54:09.895 --> 54:13.649
He dismembered one body at a neighborhood.

54:13.732 --> 54:19.779
- The man who would take me 12 minutes. - Are you trying to be tough now?

54:19.863 --> 54:23.116
Have you no respect for E2? When I...

54:23.199 --> 54:26.327
So hold dog shut up, dammit!

54:27.995 --> 54:33.501
Judging from my friend's body language, he is not too happy.

54:35.669 --> 54:38.088
They get it shown not.

54:40.048 --> 54:42.384
Arthur...

54:43.385 --> 54:47.514
You should stop. They will kill you.

54:54.228 --> 54:58.899
Do I have your attention now?

54:59.859 --> 55:03.987
Were you there when our friend was murdered?

55:05.322 --> 55:07.282
No.

55:07.366 --> 55:12.162
I do not even use my special abilities.

55:19.377 --> 55:26.050
We have seen the video, and you are part of it.

55:26.133 --> 55:31.388
Why do I film on the net when you're doing stupid things?

55:31.471 --> 55:37.394
It must be because of those reality programs, right?

55:37.477 --> 55:39.646
All will be known.

55:42.065 --> 55:45.484
Would you like to be known?

55:45.568 --> 55:48.571
Live hard and die young.

55:50.156 --> 55:54.159
Or be chopped off!

55:54.243 --> 55:58.747
Technically, it is I who chop him into pieces.

55:58.830 --> 56:03.126
He seems not to have more to say -

56:03.209 --> 56:05.712
- so now it's your turn.

56:09.298 --> 56:11.842
Where do we find Aaron?

56:13.052 --> 56:17.431
- Where the hell is Maz? - He's probably at a bitch.

56:17.514 --> 56:21.101
Call him again. - JP Call Leroy.

56:21.184 --> 56:23.311
There is something wrong.

56:23.395 --> 56:28.024
- Is it the cops? - No, we had heard it.

56:37.074 --> 56:41.870
- It may be our enemies. - There's no one out.

56:41.954 --> 56:47.000
What about Eastern Europeans? They can quickly take over.

56:47.084 --> 56:51.463
- Call me back as soon as possible. - They are insane.

56:51.546 --> 56:55.383
Would Leroy and Maz lead them here?

56:55.466 --> 56:59.971
Is there anyone who does try, we must smash them to pieces!

57:00.054 --> 57:01.806
All should be with.

57:01.889 --> 57:07.102
- JP, get pulled people off the street. - No, not from the street.

57:07.186 --> 57:12.899
Do not forget who you work for! If I say it, it just happens!

57:12.983 --> 57:16.278
- I'm just saying ... - What?

57:16.361 --> 57:21.157
I will shit on! Should you teach me about what I should do?

57:21.241 --> 57:26.787
- I just sell a little grass. - No! There will not disappear more.

57:27.455 --> 57:29.874
Find boys.

57:29.957 --> 57:33.836
What about that old that Lauren was talking to?

57:35.254 --> 57:39.341
He can not hurt us. He is as good as dead.

57:39.424 --> 57:41.760
I'm not saying a damn thing!

57:41.843 --> 57:45.555
Well, that's how I like it.

57:46.723 --> 57:51.102
- What are you going to do? - He gets on my nerves.

57:54.313 --> 57:59.318
Now you need to hear what the nice man says.

57:59.401 --> 58:01.486
Understood?

58:01.570 --> 58:07.242
We are outraged that you and your friends murdered his brother.

58:08.910 --> 58:13.790
He will know who was involved.

58:13.873 --> 58:18.335
You're going to tell us. In one way or another.

58:30.597 --> 58:34.684
It was the war veteran, who you murdered.

58:36.728 --> 58:39.188
And here ...

58:41.524 --> 58:44.401
...var for Charlie.

58:47.196 --> 58:52.784
I keep seams this pile of shit stuck to the chair -

58:52.868 --> 58:56.288
- until you tell it, we will know.

59:06.213 --> 59:09.175
Have you seen one before?

59:09.258 --> 59:12.177
A real antique!

59:13.846 --> 59:17.557
It used to take forever to ...

59:18.934 --> 59:24.063
You have no idea how hard human bones can be.

59:25.732 --> 59:30.653
That's how we used to do. In the old days.

59:30.736 --> 59:32.571
It is now ...

59:34.573 --> 59:37.076
... the new times.

59:37.159 --> 59:39.953
No no! Not that!

59:45.083 --> 59:48.711
And Dean? Where the hell is he?

59:48.795 --> 59:50.797
I gotcha.

59:57.803 --> 59:59.889
So.

01:00:01.682 --> 01:00:04.059
I'll have to take it.

01:00:07.479 --> 01:00:11.024
- Who are you with? - None. Why?

01:00:11.107 --> 01:00:13.860
Have you set Leroy and Maz?

01:00:13.943 --> 01:00:19.115
Go out on the street and ask for them! Do you now some useful Dean.

01:00:22.743 --> 01:00:26.997
- Do you have to leave? - No, I will not.

01:00:27.081 --> 01:00:29.458
But they want me to do it.

01:00:31.418 --> 01:00:36.464
Do you, or do you plan to drink the milkshake up?

01:00:38.007 --> 01:00:43.429
I will be here. For it is a really good milkshake.

01:00:49.018 --> 01:00:52.980
Sorry, kid, but you'll have to keep you awake.

01:00:53.063 --> 01:00:57.692
Otherwise, this is where the waste of time.

01:00:57.776 --> 01:01:02.864
All the bad things you've done in your awful small life -

01:01:02.947 --> 01:01:06.117
- looking forward to this.

01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:09.954
It is called retribution.

01:01:10.037 --> 01:01:13.999
Karma. Revenge.

01:01:14.083 --> 01:01:20.380
I am ready to stop this and forget and forgive -

01:01:20.464 --> 01:01:24.885
- If you tell where I can find Aaron.

01:01:30.014 --> 01:01:36.312
Okay, I was there, but I did not touch him.

01:01:36.395 --> 01:01:40.274
- Where are Aaron? - I do not know!

01:01:40.357 --> 01:01:45.237
- I have never been there. - He is lying. I can smell it.

01:02:00.710 --> 01:02:04.630
- He always know when someone is lying. - It's a gift.

01:02:04.713 --> 01:02:07.841
Fuck! Okay så...

01:02:10.052 --> 01:02:14.931
- Where do I drop off Aaron? - An even bigger lie.

01:02:15.015 --> 01:02:19.310
Fails to your friends, your damned Judas?

01:02:20.728 --> 01:02:22.814
Should I start cutting now?

01:02:26.859 --> 01:02:30.487
- No, let him go. - For fuck's sake!

01:02:30.571 --> 01:02:33.907
Let him go. He's only a child.

01:02:33.991 --> 01:02:38.453
It is a mistake, Richie. He gossips.

01:02:38.537 --> 01:02:41.873
Just tell me where I must deliver Aaron.

01:02:41.956 --> 01:02:45.627
So I do. And then I disappear.

01:02:45.710 --> 01:02:48.171
Let him go.

01:02:57.805 --> 01:03:00.766
If you mention this to anyone.

01:03:00.849 --> 01:03:06.730
Or if I see you here again, it's all over with you. Do you understand?

01:03:06.813 --> 01:03:10.525
I promise not to say anything to anyone.

01:03:17.198 --> 01:03:21.035
- I told you that he lied. - And I believed in you.

01:03:21.118 --> 01:03:26.498
But I've never killed a sitting down or tied.

01:03:26.581 --> 01:03:29.251
It is not fair.

01:03:32.462 --> 01:03:35.298
How has our veteran killer it?

01:03:45.349 --> 01:03:48.185
Oh, gee ... What a shame.

01:03:49.269 --> 01:03:52.439
So we are well finished for today.

01:04:02.990 --> 01:04:06.077
So nobody saw anything?

01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:08.662
People lie.

01:04:08.746 --> 01:04:13.208
- They're lying to me! - Anyone looking.

01:04:15.585 --> 01:04:19.256
- JP, compounds. - In several ways.

01:04:19.339 --> 01:04:25.678
He shares links with many of them, we've talked about, except for Aaron.

01:04:25.762 --> 01:04:30.558
- Where'd you get all this from? - The social media.

01:04:30.641 --> 01:04:33.811
It is quite simple, if you know where to look.

01:04:33.894 --> 01:04:39.525
- You are shown a real expert. - No, I'm just curious.

01:04:39.608 --> 01:04:45.572
- Especially with the kind of neighbors ... - We can probably do something about.

01:04:45.655 --> 01:04:51.869
This you have done. There is a better mood after you returned home.

01:04:51.953 --> 01:04:57.958
- A funeral is always good. - It was not exactly what I meant.

01:04:58.042 --> 01:05:01.628
So what do you plan?

01:05:01.712 --> 01:05:07.259
Sniff around a bit. This is extremely useful.

01:05:07.342 --> 01:05:09.511
I must continue.

01:05:09.594 --> 01:05:15.058
Let me know if you need help. I am of course ahead.

01:05:15.141 --> 01:05:17.769
Tak, Lizzy.

01:05:20.104 --> 01:05:24.108
I suppose you did not want to go to out to dinner one night?

01:05:24.191 --> 01:05:29.363
- I should not have asked. - No ... I mean, yes.

01:05:29.446 --> 01:05:34.409
- That would be nice. - Super! So I order table.

01:05:34.492 --> 01:05:40.248
And dress up in red. I remember the fabulous dress you had.

01:05:45.628 --> 01:05:49.215
Unfortunately, there is shown a red.

01:05:50.466 --> 01:05:52.509
Hey, Lauren.

01:05:54.052 --> 01:05:56.179
Why are you here again?

01:05:56.263 --> 01:06:02.352
I will not stop until I find the culprit. Do you know these?

01:06:02.435 --> 01:06:07.315
I can not. They threatened me. I can not help you anymore.

01:06:07.398 --> 01:06:11.610
Let me tell you a little about threats and blackmail.

01:06:11.694 --> 01:06:15.406
And believe me, I have great knowledge of the subject.

01:06:15.489 --> 01:06:20.118
The faster you find the end, the faster you will find the solution.

01:06:20.202 --> 01:06:25.248
They have pictures of me. They can destroy my life.

01:06:25.332 --> 01:06:30.878
They rely on your fear. It just gets worse and worse.

01:06:30.962 --> 01:06:36.092
I lived it, so I know what I'm talking about.

01:06:36.175 --> 01:06:40.012
I'll help you if you help me.

01:06:41.555 --> 01:06:46.810
I have a daughter. She is all I have, and if someone ...

01:06:46.893 --> 01:06:50.897
Let me remove them from your life.

01:06:53.816 --> 01:06:56.194
Clever girl.

01:06:56.277 --> 01:06:58.738
Thank you, Lauren. Friends?

01:06:58.821 --> 01:07:00.906
Friends.

01:07:00.990 --> 01:07:06.453
Now that we are friends, I should stop to scare you on the job.

01:07:06.537 --> 01:07:10.123
Maybe I can call you instead?

01:07:10.207 --> 01:07:13.793
- What is your number? - I have nothing.

01:07:13.877 --> 01:07:17.547
- What? Have you no mobile? - No.

01:07:17.630 --> 01:07:21.467
- A little old-fashioned? - Write your number here.

01:07:21.551 --> 01:07:25.763
They have photos of you, but I have pictures of them.

01:07:29.350 --> 01:07:31.852
The manipulated.

01:07:35.147 --> 01:07:40.568
- Was he there that night? - He was not involved.

01:07:44.489 --> 01:07:47.325
- He was there. - Do you know where he lives?

01:07:47.408 --> 01:07:52.163
No, but he sells shown in Grave's End -parkeringspladsen.

01:07:52.246 --> 01:07:55.624
- What the hell are you doing here? - Mother!

01:07:55.708 --> 01:08:00.545
Mother? I was looking for a red dress for my friend Lizzy -

01:08:00.629 --> 01:08:03.340
- but could not find anything suitable.

01:08:03.423 --> 01:08:06.760
Stay away from my daughter.

01:08:06.843 --> 01:08:10.430
I did not know she was your daughter.

01:08:10.513 --> 01:08:12.849
Thanks for expert guidance.

01:08:15.643 --> 01:08:20.104
- Are you okay? - Yes mom. It is fine.

01:08:37.537 --> 01:08:42.167
- Give me your wallet, old! - Who are you calling old?

01:08:42.585 --> 01:08:47.798
- We need him alive! - I was aiming for the rear wheel.

01:09:01.310 --> 01:09:05.481
- You know what? I enjoy it here. - So do I.

01:09:30.671 --> 01:09:33.215
There goes our bonus.

01:09:37.261 --> 01:09:39.179
Oops!

01:09:43.975 --> 01:09:48.395
Damn back! I'm too old for this.

01:09:51.607 --> 01:09:55.069
What the hell are you doing? You're dead!

01:09:55.152 --> 01:09:59.031
- Died! - I now live and kicking.

01:09:59.114 --> 01:10:03.619
- Do you remember this? - Let go of me, bastard!

01:10:03.702 --> 01:10:05.996
- Look! - It is not me.

01:10:06.079 --> 01:10:10.125
- Where's Aaron? - I've never heard of him.

01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:17.840
- So I ask again. - Fuck you!

01:10:19.759 --> 01:10:23.888
- Have you understood the point? - Shall I stab my friends?

01:10:23.971 --> 01:10:30.268
No, I just want to know where the man who killed my brother is!

01:10:31.645 --> 01:10:38.443
I will shit on how powerful you think you are, for you do not turn E2.

01:10:38.526 --> 01:10:44.657
- Sticking i Aaron, I'm dead. - So we have to work during the break.

01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:50.454
- Dry nothing. - It said your friends also yesterday.

01:10:50.537 --> 01:10:54.708
Yes, and guess what they say today?

01:10:54.791 --> 01:10:56.793
Nothing!

01:10:56.877 --> 01:11:02.465
That's the problem with your generation. You think you are immortal.

01:11:02.549 --> 01:11:06.094
But not you. Jeez, look at you.

01:11:06.177 --> 01:11:10.848
This is not a Houdini trick. You're not gonna get out of here.

01:11:10.931 --> 01:11:15.185
So kill me, because when I get out of here ...

01:11:15.269 --> 01:11:19.773
When? One must admire his optimism.

01:11:19.856 --> 01:11:23.818
- I'll kill you all! - How fun...

01:11:23.902 --> 01:11:27.739
It said Maz and Leroy too.

01:11:28.573 --> 01:11:31.451
Just before we killed them!

01:11:32.994 --> 01:11:39.250
Fuck you! When E2 find out here, are you on the ass! Are you with me?

01:11:39.333 --> 01:11:44.212
Your wives, girlfriends and all I know.

01:11:44.296 --> 01:11:49.884
We're going to fuck them in every hole. In particular in the ass!

01:11:51.928 --> 01:11:54.389
Do you have any daughters?

01:11:56.099 --> 01:11:58.684
You have a daughter, right?

01:11:58.768 --> 01:12:03.230
When E2 is finished with her, she could not move!

01:12:03.314 --> 01:12:07.442
She's not going to be able to walk properly.

01:12:07.526 --> 01:12:13.198
One by one: Fuck, fuck, fuck! And she will love it!

01:12:14.449 --> 01:12:16.951
You know what the irony is?

01:12:18.745 --> 01:12:22.081
It here belonged to my brother.

01:12:26.961 --> 01:12:32.799
Why do not you go down on his knees, as he did -

01:12:32.883 --> 01:12:36.511
- and begging as he did?

01:12:45.478 --> 01:12:48.481
And we just laughed.

01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:55.654
We laughed at your cowardly brother. We ripped open him up like a fat whore.

01:13:04.704 --> 01:13:07.415
What do you think of the irony in that?

01:13:11.377 --> 01:13:14.672
Gee, it was easier in the old days.

01:13:14.755 --> 01:13:17.758
- What now? - Now...

01:13:17.842 --> 01:13:20.469
Now it's time for the big finale.

01:13:20.552 --> 01:13:23.722
- Damn! - Richie, are you okay?

01:13:32.230 --> 01:13:35.400
I'll be right back. No excitement.

01:13:35.483 --> 01:13:42.031
- How it is with you in the room? - There are still certain gentlemen.

01:13:42.114 --> 01:13:47.035
- How do you feel? - Vulnerable. I hope in a private room.

01:13:47.119 --> 01:13:50.789
Just what I thought. This place is far too open.

01:13:50.872 --> 01:13:55.877
Although they knew that you were here, they would not dare venture here.

01:13:55.960 --> 01:14:00.089
Just I do not have to sleep with one eye open.

01:14:00.173 --> 01:14:05.720
- We take care of it. - No, I'm not done yet.

01:14:05.803 --> 01:14:10.015
Should someone poke a Christmas tree up in the ass on the little shit, it's me.

01:14:10.099 --> 01:14:15.395
Give me a phone. I'll call a friend. Thank you.

01:14:18.982 --> 01:14:22.735
My savings. Smell them!

01:14:28.824 --> 01:14:34.204
We should have bought a long time ago. Now fucker not with us.

01:14:35.956 --> 01:14:38.875
Idiot...

01:14:38.959 --> 01:14:41.378
Take a gun.

01:14:41.461 --> 01:14:43.922
Take one.

01:14:45.882 --> 01:14:48.468
She will talk to you.

01:14:48.551 --> 01:14:53.639
- What the hell do you want? - I have information on the old one.

01:14:54.390 --> 01:14:56.934
He who is in you.

01:14:57.893 --> 01:15:02.606
- What's with him? - He is in the hospital, says mother.

01:15:02.689 --> 01:15:06.443
He had a heart attack. It fits.

01:15:06.526 --> 01:15:09.738
Why are you telling it to me?

01:15:11.364 --> 01:15:15.201
- Because I thought ... - Did you think of us or what?

01:15:15.284 --> 01:15:19.372
- You might need me. - Hands off, bitch!

01:15:19.455 --> 01:15:24.043
Call the hospital and find out where he is.

01:15:24.126 --> 01:15:27.588
- I can not. - Just do it!

01:15:34.344 --> 01:15:38.723
Hi, I would like to know where Richie Archer is.

01:15:38.806 --> 01:15:42.101
Yes, he's my uncle.

01:15:42.185 --> 01:15:44.603
At the heart department.

01:15:44.687 --> 01:15:47.731
That was nice to hear. Thanks.

01:15:50.484 --> 01:15:52.569
There you can see.

01:15:53.612 --> 01:15:58.158
DK, download the guys. We are going on a home visit.

01:15:59.451 --> 01:16:03.121
Take the bitch with. She comes with us.

01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:26.810
- What are you doing? - It's Mom. If not I answer ...

01:16:26.893 --> 01:16:29.896
Let me talk to her.

01:16:29.979 --> 01:16:32.565
You stay here with me.

01:16:33.566 --> 01:16:35.609
Take this on.

01:16:35.693 --> 01:16:38.362
Do it now, damn it!

01:17:31.703 --> 01:17:34.581
- UK. - Yes?

01:17:34.665 --> 01:17:38.084
- Will you rise through the ranks? - Should I do it?

01:17:38.168 --> 01:17:41.713
Are you a leader or a follower?

01:17:41.796 --> 01:17:43.965
Away with you.

01:18:18.831 --> 01:18:23.502
Hi there! You should have brought flowers.

01:18:27.047 --> 01:18:32.927
Have you seen one before? The shoots do damned sorry, I can promise you.

01:18:33.011 --> 01:18:35.638
Are there more outside?

01:18:38.015 --> 01:18:40.309
How many?

01:18:40.810 --> 01:18:44.355
Reply, dammit!

01:18:44.438 --> 01:18:46.773
Arthur, check out just as a precaution.

01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:52.696
It was a gun!

01:18:53.613 --> 01:18:55.865
What the hell is going on here?

01:18:58.368 --> 01:19:00.703
THIS IS IT!

01:19:00.787 --> 01:19:03.789
Fucking bitch, you tricked me!

01:19:06.083 --> 01:19:08.544
What the hell are you doing, Dean?

01:19:31.857 --> 01:19:35.778
- I hope you're heading home. - Mother!

01:19:35.861 --> 01:19:39.031
I have shown need your help!

01:19:52.084 --> 01:19:56.088
- Is there another entrance? - Have no idea. I am checking.

01:19:56.172 --> 01:19:59.925
- Do not do anything stupid. - Me? Never in my life.

01:20:12.729 --> 01:20:15.023
Fuck!

01:20:34.040 --> 01:20:35.959
Before hell!

01:20:41.964 --> 01:20:44.133
Help here.

01:20:50.347 --> 01:20:53.517
Special strength is in place.

01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:58.146
- You know what's going on? - Not yet. We can hear gunfire.

01:20:58.229 --> 01:21:00.523
The strength moving into now.

01:21:00.607 --> 01:21:04.694
- My daughter's in there. - She's smart enough to hide.

01:21:04.777 --> 01:21:09.490
They are many. And I mean a lot.

01:21:11.534 --> 01:21:14.286
Are they stupid or what?

01:21:19.916 --> 01:21:22.919
The hallway is empty. Hold jer ready.

01:21:23.003 --> 01:21:25.588
Good morning, ladies!

01:21:41.812 --> 01:21:44.690
Come on, now we shoot them!

01:21:49.861 --> 01:21:52.155
I got him!

01:22:01.205 --> 01:22:05.375
- I'm sorry if you thought that ... - It's okay. I am in.

01:22:05.459 --> 01:22:09.629
It's a pretty memorable second date.

01:22:11.256 --> 01:22:15.969
- We must away. Cops are coming! - No, we finish this today!

01:22:16.052 --> 01:22:19.222
Keep shooting. I have an idea.

01:22:19.305 --> 01:22:21.307
Fart on!

01:22:31.942 --> 01:22:34.820
No thrills, my bare ass!

01:22:34.903 --> 01:22:40.658
- abound soon with cops. - I'm not sorry to see them.

01:22:40.742 --> 01:22:45.413
Listen! I have your little gossip bitch here! Are you with me?

01:22:46.497 --> 01:22:51.460
I shoot her head off if you do not put your weapons!

01:22:52.461 --> 01:22:55.798
I swear! You have five seconds!

01:22:55.881 --> 01:22:57.883
Hear me?

01:22:57.966 --> 01:23:00.927
Five, four!

01:23:01.011 --> 01:23:02.971
Shut up!

01:23:03.054 --> 01:23:05.014
Three!

01:23:05.098 --> 01:23:07.267
To!

01:23:07.350 --> 01:23:13.272
- Well then, I'm coming out. - Are you crazy? It is suicidal!

01:23:13.356 --> 01:23:18.402
Butch, you have no daughter, right? She's just a child.

01:23:18.485 --> 01:23:21.905
Okay, we're coming out!

01:23:23.573 --> 01:23:25.408
Fart on!

01:23:27.369 --> 01:23:30.371
Hands where I can see them!

01:23:30.455 --> 01:23:33.791
Now you have me, let her go.

01:23:35.334 --> 01:23:40.297
I told you, old man! And now you're dead.

01:23:40.381 --> 01:23:44.426
- But first we kill your boys. - As we kill yours?

01:23:44.510 --> 01:23:46.261
E2 is an army.

01:23:46.345 --> 01:23:51.099
- There are just more people. - Like cockroaches, cluttering the shit.

01:23:51.183 --> 01:23:55.103
You know what you have, your old gangster?

01:23:55.186 --> 01:23:59.732
I'll tell you. You have 30 seconds.

01:23:59.816 --> 01:24:02.985
So who should I kill first? You?

01:24:13.412 --> 01:24:15.413
Get away from me!

01:24:27.133 --> 01:24:31.679
- Shoot the little pigs, Richie! - Oh, damn.

01:24:35.265 --> 01:24:38.352
It was Charlie.

01:24:38.435 --> 01:24:42.022
Traveling you? And this is for me.

01:24:48.027 --> 01:24:53.282
- Release your weapons! - You need to know when you've lost.

01:24:53.366 --> 01:24:56.160
Police, put your weapons!

01:25:08.421 --> 01:25:15.136
- So it was self-defense? - We have told what happened.

01:25:15.219 --> 01:25:20.850
We were sleeping when the two guys suddenly walk in the door.

01:25:20.933 --> 01:25:24.603
And I disarmed them? 70-year-old men.

01:25:24.686 --> 01:25:30.192
Now is not serious, inspector. I'm actually the youngest man in the gang.

01:25:30.275 --> 01:25:33.987
- Give us a minute? - See you.

01:25:41.077 --> 01:25:44.914
- Was that all? - I do not understand what you mean.

01:25:44.997 --> 01:25:51.211
It is teeming with police outside that I can leave you to.

01:25:52.170 --> 01:25:56.132
So I ask again: Was it?

01:25:56.216 --> 01:26:02.889
As soon as I printed, I travel back to Spain.

01:26:02.972 --> 01:26:09.603
Now the streets are clean and fine again. I think that the local deserve.

01:26:12.398 --> 01:26:17.736
Just one last thing. It's probably my last chance to get it said.

01:26:17.819 --> 01:26:20.739
- What? - Thanks.

01:26:20.822 --> 01:26:24.242
- For what? - To you saved my daughter.

01:26:28.663 --> 01:26:31.832
- How is the East End now? - Quietly.

01:26:31.916 --> 01:26:36.545
I should have attended the funeral.

01:26:36.629 --> 01:26:40.132
- You knew him not. Your place is there. - And what about yours?

01:26:43.760 --> 01:26:48.223
Have you got homesick, or have you met one?

01:26:48.306 --> 01:26:52.060
- I'm home for dinner. - So I do something.

01:26:52.143 --> 01:26:57.023
No, I take some pies with. Very English food.

01:26:57.106 --> 01:27:01.151
Okay, have a good flight. I love you dad.

01:27:01.235 --> 01:27:04.154
I love you too. Hi there!

01:27:11.369 --> 01:27:15.248
I do not go with out. I hate to say goodbye.

01:27:15.331 --> 01:27:20.586
- We had never eaten the dinner. - No, you already has had little busy.

01:27:22.088 --> 01:27:26.592
You can go to Spain. I shall have need of a home.

01:27:26.675 --> 01:27:28.802
You sell it as well.

01:27:28.886 --> 01:27:34.850
The girls are here, and now it feels like a home again thanks to you.

01:27:35.559 --> 01:27:38.687
The invitation is open, Lizzy.

01:27:43.232 --> 01:27:46.777
- Richie? - Ja?

01:27:49.697 --> 01:27:52.283
Take care of yourself.

01:28:00.999 --> 01:28:03.084
Fuck...

01:28:17.556 --> 01:28:21.018
- Well, he went. - Yes...

01:28:21.101 --> 01:28:24.855
If you joke about around in the sun and play golf -

01:28:24.938 --> 01:28:29.025
- instead of being here is not worth the trouble.

01:28:29.109 --> 01:28:32.487
I know you're not lying, -

01:28:32.570 --> 01:28:35.448
- and I agree with you.

01:28:35.531 --> 01:28:40.828
After everything we've been through, so he turns us back again.

01:28:40.911 --> 01:28:45.290
- Just like 20 years ago. - Now not so unjust, guys.

01:28:45.374 --> 01:28:50.212
I fled from the police to keep them away from you guys.

01:28:50.295 --> 01:28:52.964
Who are you calling a villain?

01:28:53.048 --> 01:28:57.385
Why were you? And now lie not for me.

01:28:57.468 --> 01:29:02.014
- Lizzy? - She may have little to do with it.

01:29:02.098 --> 01:29:08.228
No, it was something else. To clean the streets and remove skimmings.

01:29:08.312 --> 01:29:14.526
The received blood to the pump. I assume that I felt the same.

01:29:14.609 --> 01:29:18.613
That is what we are and that's what we do.

01:29:18.697 --> 01:29:23.117
It was Satan! Where did that gibberish from?

01:29:23.201 --> 01:29:26.454
He has spent too much time with the Europeans.

01:29:26.537 --> 01:29:30.624
Lizzy said a thing. She talked about pensioners -

01:29:30.708 --> 01:29:35.337
- who live here and who are robbed of their savings.

01:29:35.420 --> 01:29:37.631
- Thieves? - Bank directors.

01:29:37.714 --> 01:29:39.674
It is the same.

01:29:39.758 --> 01:29:43.970
I thought that we could teach them a lesson.

01:29:44.054 --> 01:29:47.765
- Do I beat one of them? - I will make them really hurt.

01:29:47.849 --> 01:29:50.935
Yes, we are stealing their money.

01:29:51.018 --> 01:29:54.230
Do you remember what we did with Charlie in 69?

01:29:54.313 --> 01:29:58.442
How would I, could forget it?

01:29:58.525 --> 01:30:00.777
Vent...

01:30:01.904 --> 01:30:05.198
Do you want to steal their gold?

01:30:05.282 --> 01:30:06.992
How?

01:30:07.075 --> 01:30:09.786
Let me buy you a drink.

01:30:09.869 --> 01:30:12.538
I have an excellent idea.

01:30:12.562 --> 01:30:22.562
