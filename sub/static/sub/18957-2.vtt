You know, your brother's
my guy for spotting cheats.

00:25.760 --> 00:27.128
And there's nobody better,

00:27.195 --> 00:28.997
but I don't think even he

00:29.063 --> 00:30.431
could spot that. Could you spot that?

00:30.498 --> 00:32.433
One second. What the fuck
is your boss doing here?

00:32.500 --> 00:34.068
- Look, I told him.
- You told him?

00:34.135 --> 00:35.904
- You told him what?
- I think he could help.

00:35.970 --> 00:37.972
Just listen for a second.

00:38.039 --> 00:41.075
I'm sorry.
I... I don't really understand.

00:42.410 --> 00:44.345
What? You need some money?

00:44.412 --> 00:45.814
I'm here, Marius,

00:45.880 --> 00:48.382
because I heard that you
were taking down a cheater.

00:48.449 --> 00:50.451
And I don't like cheaters.

00:50.518 --> 00:51.652
And he's good, Marius.

00:51.719 --> 00:53.287
- You've seen him play?
- No. No.

00:53.354 --> 00:55.089
- But he's been playing for years.
- All right. All right.

00:55.156 --> 00:56.124
He...

00:58.126 --> 00:59.427

00:59.493 --> 01:00.829

01:00.829 --> 01:02.196
Yeah?

01:02.263 --> 01:03.397
Yeah?

01:03.464 --> 01:04.833
Okay.

01:04.866 --> 01:07.301
- That too fast?
- No. Row.

01:07.368 --> 01:09.170
I don't know what my brother told you,

01:09.237 --> 01:11.840
but, we're not looking for card players.

01:11.840 --> 01:13.007

Gold Circle's 50.

a hundred thousand dollars

I'll print the program.

I've been playing this

02:40.294 --> 02:41.930
Maybe you pushed Vince
too hard back there?

02:41.930 --> 02:44.598
He's gonna call before we get in the cab.

Really?

05:57.024 --> 05:58.459
Not yet.

05:59.893 --> 06:01.729
Vince has a big player.

06:01.795 --> 06:03.564
He's ahead,
and Eddie's his favorite dealer.

06:03.631 --> 06:05.333
Why do you want to know where Eddie is?

06:05.399 --> 06:07.901
Are you thinking of grabbing him?

Vince has Richard on Eddie.

06:10.371 --> 06:12.506
He doesn't let him out of his sight.

06:12.573 --> 06:14.442
Why does Vince have
his guys looking for me?

06:14.508 --> 06:16.244
- You ran before.
- Vince doesn't want to hurt me.

06:16.310 --> 06:17.711
Well, he wants to know where you are.

06:17.778 --> 06:19.547
Winslow, however, he wants to kill you.

06:19.613 --> 06:22.150
Vince is not gonna
let Winslow do anything.

06:22.150 --> 06:23.617
Oh, yeah? You don't think

06:23.684 --> 06:25.686

You got to get up at
the crack to get that...

11:29.757 --> 11:31.191
"who was around before Brendon?"

11:31.258 --> 11:32.660
Couldn't remember your name.

11:32.726 --> 11:35.496
Maybe because she hasn't
seen you in five years.

11:35.563 --> 11:38.766
Well, you... you told me to leave.

11:39.867 --> 11:41.835
That's how you remember it, huh?

11:41.902 --> 11:44.337

11:46.474 --> 11:47.775
Well, she wasn't prettier,

11:47.841 --> 11:49.477
but she was better at accents.

11:49.543 --> 11:53.146
And then there was her

Oh, no, no, no, no.
I'm not asking for money.

12:31.619 --> 12:33.386

in a couple of days ago,

12:41.562 --> 12:44.097
No. I don't want to have anything to do

12:44.164 --> 12:45.533

- I'm not running a con.

13:31.144 --> 13:33.213
Write down the details of the play.

13:33.280 --> 13:34.982
Keep it simple.

13:41.221 --> 13:43.691
You know anyone driving a black Grand Am?

13:43.757 --> 13:45.392
Force of habit.
I always clock the cars on the block.

13:45.458 --> 13:46.827
I haven't seen that car before.

13:46.894 --> 13:48.996
The place I'm staying,
there's some suspicion.

13:49.062 --> 13:51.999
What? I... I don't want
your shit coming here.

13:52.065 --> 13:53.601
You know, it's really not a big deal.

13:53.667 --> 13:55.202
Hey, I'm going to need a favor.

13:55.268 --> 13:57.437
- Oh, for fuck's sake.
- That thing you did in Wichita.

13:57.504 --> 13:59.039
Do you remember that?

14:01.241 --> 14:03.376
Are you fucking serious?

14:03.443 --> 14:05.312
Please?

14:28.101 --> 14:29.870
Thank you, universe.

14:37.210 --> 14:39.179
[rooster crows]

14:41.081 --> 14:44.752
I wonder what he's been
doing for the last 20 years.

14:50.090 --> 14:52.025
He said insurance.

14:53.460 --> 14:57.097
Well, he wasn't in insurance
when he was a teenager.

14:58.131 --> 15:00.067
We don't know anything about him

15:00.133 --> 15:03.804
except who his father is
and who his mother is.

15:05.072 --> 15:07.675
Who knows how far he fell from that tree?

15:09.309 --> 15:10.410
Look.

15:10.477 --> 15:13.146
I know he snuck out last night.

15:13.213 --> 15:15.783
He hit a squeaky floorboard
and went out the window.

15:15.849 --> 15:17.918
I never heard him come back.

15:19.452 --> 15:20.754
Hey.

15:22.690 --> 15:25.793
The house is still very quiet.

15:30.363 --> 15:33.133
We'll see what the doctor
has to say about that.

15:35.168 --> 15:37.104
I'm not dead yet, for Christ's sakes.

15:38.205 --> 15:40.874
This is going to be a really sad last run

15:40.941 --> 15:42.876
if Dr. Geffen says that's off the table.

15:42.943 --> 15:45.345
It's not all about you, Otto.

15:46.714 --> 15:48.615
How do you think I'd feel if you kick it

15:48.716 --> 15:50.283
when you're on top of me some night?

15:51.518 --> 15:53.921
Nobody says you can't be on top.

16:08.401 --> 16:09.336
Oh.

16:09.402 --> 16:10.537
Hey.

16:10.603 --> 16:11.571
Good morning, Pete.

16:11.638 --> 16:12.873
Good morning.

16:12.940 --> 16:14.374
- How'd you sleep?
- Oh, well, you know,

16:14.441 --> 16:16.944
I'm still getting used
to the bed a little bit.

16:19.847 --> 16:21.749
Eggs will be up in ten.

16:22.850 --> 16:26.153
Actually, to be honest, Grandma,

16:26.219 --> 16:27.220
I, uh...

16:28.756 --> 16:30.257
I didn't sleep at all last night.

16:30.323 --> 16:31.424
Hmm?

16:32.760 --> 16:34.194
I snuck out.

16:34.261 --> 16:36.363
I didn't want to wake you, so I...

16:36.429 --> 16:37.998
I went out the window.

16:39.166 --> 16:42.435
And I... I borrowed your truck.

16:42.502 --> 16:43.937
I went to the city with it.

16:44.004 --> 16:46.974
I drove to White Plains to...
to visit a friend.

16:47.040 --> 16:50.143
Uh, and I am so sorry.

16:50.210 --> 16:51.912
I'll pay you back for the gas.

16:51.979 --> 16:54.447
All you have to do is ask, Pete.

16:54.514 --> 16:56.683
There's no need to sneak around.

16:56.784 --> 16:58.218
I know. I know.

16:58.285 --> 16:59.787
We have an old beater you can use

16:59.853 --> 17:01.154
to get around whenever you need.

17:02.689 --> 17:04.424
Well, thank you.

17:04.491 --> 17:05.657
Hey, I got a question for you.

17:05.792 --> 17:06.659
Yeah?

17:06.794 --> 17:08.228
Whose room am I in?

17:09.596 --> 17:11.064
You don't remember?

17:11.131 --> 17:12.833
I know that it was either
my mother's or my aunt's,

17:12.900 --> 17:14.134
but I can't remember which.

17:14.201 --> 17:17.003
I, uh... I just...
I know that there was a, uh,

17:17.069 --> 17:20.240
an access to an attic
in one of the rooms,

17:20.307 --> 17:22.108
and Taylor and I used to go up there.

17:22.175 --> 17:24.411
We would, uh,
set up our mad scientist lab

17:24.477 --> 17:26.479
and, you know,
mix together potions and all that.

17:26.546 --> 17:27.881
Do you remember that? Yeah.

17:27.948 --> 17:30.050
You made an unholy mess up there.

17:30.117 --> 17:32.019
Well, we were mad scientists.

17:33.020 --> 17:34.855
Uh, the attic access

17:34.922 --> 17:36.723
was in your aunt Lila's room.

17:36.824 --> 17:38.491
This was Maggie's.

17:42.495 --> 17:43.831
You changed it.

17:45.598 --> 17:46.934
Yes, I did.

18:08.221 --> 18:10.123
[mouthing]

18:15.728 --> 18:17.364
Julia: You look tired.

18:18.565 --> 18:19.867
Studying for the exam.

18:19.933 --> 18:21.401
Oh, yeah? How's that going?

18:21.468 --> 18:22.569
It's going.

18:22.635 --> 18:24.371
Did you know in the state of Connecticut,

18:24.437 --> 18:27.274
for a pickle to be considered a pickle,

18:27.340 --> 18:28.909
it must bounce?

18:28.976 --> 18:31.378
You studying to become a food inspector?

18:31.444 --> 18:34.414
Taylor's going to take
his detective exam... again.

18:34.481 --> 18:36.783
Well, at least he's
trying to accomplish something.

18:36.884 --> 18:38.551
She was just joking, Audrey.

18:38.618 --> 18:39.752
I was?

18:39.887 --> 18:41.889
So when are we going to head to Pine Top?

18:41.889 --> 18:44.091
- Hmm?
- Uh, yeah.

18:44.157 --> 18:46.793
Whenever you...
Whenever you want to do that.

18:46.894 --> 18:48.461
You...

18:48.528 --> 18:51.198
You remember when we...
we blew up that old truck?

18:51.264 --> 18:55.102
Right?
With all that... that stolen dynamite?

18:55.168 --> 18:56.603
Hmm?

18:56.669 --> 18:58.005
Do you remember that?

18:58.071 --> 19:01.441
My sainted brother broke the law?

19:01.508 --> 19:03.310
No, I... It was...

19:03.376 --> 19:06.146
We blew up a paint
can with a firecracker.

19:06.213 --> 19:08.715
Oh, Grandpa,
I was hoping to leave Jacob with you

19:08.781 --> 19:10.383
while I went to the shop today.

19:10.450 --> 19:12.485
I knew you'd forget. I told you

19:12.552 --> 19:14.387
I have to take Otto to
the doctor this morning.

19:14.454 --> 19:16.223
When are you going to
line up some day care

19:16.289 --> 19:18.191
- that isn't your grandfather?
- I don't mind.

19:19.392 --> 19:20.827
I don't mind.

19:20.928 --> 19:22.362
We'll come over to the shop right after.

19:22.429 --> 19:23.630
Hey, you know, I can go with Julia

19:23.696 --> 19:25.032
and watch Jacob.

19:25.098 --> 19:26.699
You know, I got to learn the job.

19:26.766 --> 19:28.435
You ever babysat a 2-year-old?

19:28.501 --> 19:31.071
Yeah, I find that with their first beer,
they're really easy.

19:46.954 --> 19:49.089
[phone rings]

19:49.156 --> 19:50.557
[singing on radio]

19:50.623 --> 19:52.825
Hey. What do you have?

19:52.960 --> 19:57.097
Uh, left your place around 10.

19:57.164 --> 19:59.399
Drove to the city. Parked in Chinatown.

19:59.466 --> 20:01.901
A woman came out... beautiful, money.

20:01.969 --> 20:04.271
Stays there, mm, an hour

20:04.337 --> 20:05.738
and then drives to a house

20:05.805 --> 20:07.107
in White Plains.

20:07.174 --> 20:09.076
Stayed there till about 1.

20:09.142 --> 20:11.478
Slept in the truck a few hours.

20:11.544 --> 20:12.712
At least I assume he...

20:12.779 --> 20:14.047
he slept. I know I did.

20:14.114 --> 20:15.915
Uh, a little before dawn,

20:15.983 --> 20:18.751
he goes into a house,

20:18.818 --> 20:20.720
into a house,

20:20.787 --> 20:24.591
meets with a woman for a bed.

20:24.657 --> 20:26.326
Heads back to the party.

20:26.393 --> 20:28.028
He clocked you?

20:28.095 --> 20:29.796
Probably. I'm terrible at this.

20:29.862 --> 20:32.132
He told me he skipped out,
took my truck into the city.

20:32.199 --> 20:34.734
I wondered if maybe he
knew he'd been followed,

20:34.801 --> 20:37.237
was trying to play off my suspicions.

20:37.304 --> 20:38.471
Whatever you're thinking

20:38.538 --> 20:40.573
your long-lost grandson is up to,

20:40.640 --> 20:42.542
he is in a situation.

20:42.609 --> 20:43.643
What kind?

20:43.710 --> 20:45.545
The oldes... well, the second oldest.

20:45.612 --> 20:48.648
The woman in White Plains is Katie Boyd.

20:48.715 --> 20:52.052
Husband is Brendon Boyd.

20:52.119 --> 20:55.055
Pretty sure your Pete is bumping uglies

20:55.122 --> 20:56.456
with Mrs. Katie Boyd.

20:56.523 --> 20:59.492
You want me to stay on him?

21:01.228 --> 21:04.131
Uh, maybe I just
picked up on the cheating.

21:04.197 --> 21:06.299
- Set off my alarms.
- Yeah, you do have

21:06.366 --> 21:07.934
a pretty good instinct in that regard.

21:08.035 --> 21:11.671
How much longer do I have
to keep doing shit for you?

21:11.738 --> 21:13.573
I mean, I'm not asking for
the exact date,

21:13.640 --> 21:16.076
- more general.
- Oh, I don't know, Sam.

21:16.143 --> 21:17.877
I'd say you have to keep
doing what I ask you

21:17.944 --> 21:20.180
until you pay what you owe.

21:32.625 --> 21:34.594
I thought you were getting ready.

21:35.862 --> 21:37.264
I'm ready.

21:41.234 --> 21:42.635
<i>Julia: Miss Trotosian,</i>

21:42.702 --> 21:44.537
<i>I've talked to his lawyer and the jail.</i>

21:44.604 --> 21:48.108
<i>Bring all the documentation
and the check,</i>

21:48.175 --> 21:50.210
<i>and we should have him out after lunch.</i>

21:53.913 --> 21:55.148
Nice.

21:56.083 --> 21:57.150
Well,

21:57.217 --> 21:58.585
my whale thinks he's a big shot,

21:58.651 --> 22:00.320
so we got to treat him like a big shot,
right?

22:00.387 --> 22:02.089
I don't make up the rules.

22:02.155 --> 22:03.323
Who's the whale?

22:03.390 --> 22:05.125
His name is, uh, Charles McGregor.

22:05.192 --> 22:06.993
He, runs... well, he ran

22:07.094 --> 22:08.628
a small, very successful hedge fund,

22:08.695 --> 22:10.797
and now he, uh, plays bridge full time.

22:10.863 --> 22:13.566
Uh, another Wall Street
asshole playing bridge, huh?

22:13.633 --> 22:14.701
[chuckling]

22:14.767 --> 22:16.769
So what's the play?

22:16.836 --> 22:19.606
We draw him and his partner
into a high-stakes game.

22:19.672 --> 22:22.242
We let them win for three weeks in a row,

22:22.309 --> 22:23.643
and then we clean him out.

22:26.113 --> 22:27.380
How does he cheat?

22:27.447 --> 22:29.116
What is it, a cough code,

22:29.182 --> 22:32.485
or are we playing footsies
like the Italians?

22:32.552 --> 22:34.587
Uh, yeah,
it took me a while to figure it out.

22:34.654 --> 22:37.124
At first I thought it was
like the Norwegians, right?

22:37.190 --> 22:40.260
But then I noticed how he moves
his cards when he's sorting.

22:40.327 --> 22:43.830
The first card he moves
indicates the suit.

22:43.896 --> 22:46.333
If he moves it all the way to the left,
it's spades.

22:46.399 --> 22:48.268
Second slot is hearts, so on, so forth.

22:48.335 --> 22:50.237
Second card indicates a number,

22:50.303 --> 22:51.738
which he moves to the right.

22:51.804 --> 22:53.640
Ah, very good.

22:53.706 --> 22:56.276
Good eye. Okay. Saying you're right...

22:56.343 --> 22:57.877
- I am right.
- Which, well, we'll see.

22:57.944 --> 22:59.279
I'm right.

22:59.346 --> 23:00.580
I still don't see the play.

23:00.647 --> 23:02.415
I mean, how do we cheat the cheater?

23:02.482 --> 23:04.184
We can't leave it to chance.

23:04.251 --> 23:05.618
No, no, no, no. No.

23:05.685 --> 23:07.420
I never leave anything to chance.

23:07.487 --> 23:10.022
No, I got... I got an inside man.

23:10.157 --> 23:13.193
Not a man but a woman.

23:17.564 --> 23:18.231
That's you.

23:18.298 --> 23:20.867
Yes, it's me.

23:24.671 --> 23:26.673
Thank you for choosing
Bernhardt Bail Bonds.

23:26.739 --> 23:28.575
We know you have a choice
when it comes...

23:28.641 --> 23:29.842
[click, dial tone]

23:33.246 --> 23:35.848
Whoo-hoo. Another $200.

23:35.915 --> 23:37.384
We're saved.

23:38.585 --> 23:39.519
I got a question

23:39.586 --> 23:41.321
I've wanted answered for 20 years.

23:41.388 --> 23:43.856
What's in the safe?

23:46.493 --> 23:48.628
No, I just... I just have a memory

23:48.695 --> 23:50.062
of all of us wondering what was in there.

23:50.197 --> 23:51.798
Oh, just say it.

23:51.864 --> 23:52.799
What?

23:52.865 --> 23:54.033
"Rublies."

23:54.100 --> 23:55.101
What?

23:55.202 --> 23:56.336
You don't remember rublies?

23:56.403 --> 23:58.638
When we were kids,

23:58.705 --> 24:02.409
I said there might be gold
and diamonds and rublies.

24:02.475 --> 24:04.344
- Oh, right.
- I thought there was an L in it.

24:04.411 --> 24:05.645
That was hilarious.

24:05.712 --> 24:06.479
Yeah, for you.

24:06.546 --> 24:07.914
Called me rublies for a week.

24:07.980 --> 24:10.417
I was just happy you
were calling me anything.

24:10.483 --> 24:11.451
So...

24:12.719 --> 24:13.820
Yeah, well,

24:13.886 --> 24:15.688
so there's no gold and rublies in there,
huh?

24:15.755 --> 24:17.123
[snickering]

24:17.224 --> 24:19.226
Life was better when we were 10.

24:20.393 --> 24:22.061
Yeah, it's mostly collateral.

24:22.128 --> 24:23.996
Some jewelry, silverware,

24:24.063 --> 24:26.666
a rare book once. Why?
You thinking of robbing it?

24:26.733 --> 24:28.768
Well, not if that's all that's in there.

24:30.069 --> 24:31.371
- Hey.
- Hey.

24:31.438 --> 24:33.273
Uh, I got a couple of people

24:33.340 --> 24:35.275
coming by later to fill out paperwork

24:35.342 --> 24:36.776
and drop off a check.

24:36.843 --> 24:38.245
Thought I'd take Pete
with me out on rounds.

24:38.311 --> 24:40.112
Jacob's down for his nap.

24:40.247 --> 24:42.582
Snacks and juice are in the bag.

24:42.649 --> 24:43.816
And, uh, thanks.

24:43.883 --> 24:45.252
Our pleasure, sweetheart.

24:45.285 --> 24:46.719
How was the, uh, the doctor, Grandpa?

24:46.786 --> 24:47.887
Oh, he said I was fine.

24:47.954 --> 24:49.622
He said you shouldn't exert yourself.

24:49.689 --> 24:52.259
He said I shouldn't exert myself

24:52.292 --> 24:53.826
any more than any man my age.

24:53.893 --> 24:55.094
And how old are you?

24:55.161 --> 24:57.163
25 when I look in the mirror.

24:57.264 --> 24:59.299
<i>♪ Surprise ♪</i>

24:59.366 --> 25:00.733
<i>♪ Let go ♪</i>

25:00.800 --> 25:03.035
You didn't tell Grandma about Persikof,
did you?

25:03.102 --> 25:05.472
Oh, I will. Soon.

25:06.673 --> 25:07.340
Some day.

25:07.407 --> 25:09.509
Maybe on her deathbed.

25:09.576 --> 25:10.410
Or mine.

25:10.477 --> 25:11.544
The way things are right now,

25:11.611 --> 25:12.679
I'll probably check out first.

25:12.745 --> 25:14.414
What happens now with Persikof?

25:14.481 --> 25:15.948
Well, Connecticut and
New York fight over him.

25:16.015 --> 25:17.950
New York probably wins,
murder trumping tax evasion.

25:18.017 --> 25:20.052
Right, but New York doesn't
know Connecticut has him, right?

25:20.119 --> 25:21.921
You didn't tell Taylor
about the New York warrant,

25:21.988 --> 25:24.023
and I'm pretty sure Persikof
didn't say anything.

25:24.090 --> 25:25.525
What are you thinking?
You're thinking something.

25:25.592 --> 25:27.159
Does Persikof get another bail hearing?

25:27.294 --> 25:28.395
This morning, but it'll be short.

25:28.461 --> 25:29.996
Bail will be revoked because he skipped.

25:30.062 --> 25:31.298
Okay, so this is...

25:31.331 --> 25:32.765
this is where it gets
a little complicated

25:32.832 --> 25:35.635
because I... I quit my
insurance job so abruptly,

25:35.702 --> 25:39.306
my former boss is being
slow on my last paycheck,

25:39.339 --> 25:41.374
and, because I was living
hand to mouth...

25:41.441 --> 25:43.209
You want money? We're broke.

25:43.310 --> 25:44.477
No, no, no. I'm just saying.

25:44.544 --> 25:46.446
If new... new bail is granted,

25:46.513 --> 25:49.882
then, you know, maybe...
maybe I... I... I get half.

25:49.949 --> 25:52.385
New bail?
This guy's beyond a flight risk.

25:52.452 --> 25:54.387
But this time is collateral,

25:54.454 --> 25:57.690
you get, you know,
uh, his mother's house.

25:58.725 --> 26:01.461
I could give you 10%, tops.

26:01.528 --> 26:02.729
But it better be a brilliant plan.

26:02.795 --> 26:04.130
- It's a real...
- Let's hear it.

26:04.196 --> 26:05.765
Okay. So we go to Persikof's lawyer...

26:05.832 --> 26:07.334
Mm-mm.

26:07.400 --> 26:09.936
What, you know him?

26:10.002 --> 26:13.105
I do. Long story.

26:13.172 --> 26:15.207
Can you get past it?

26:15.342 --> 26:16.709
I can try.

26:16.776 --> 26:18.711
And now it's got to be
the best plan ever.

26:18.778 --> 26:21.648
It starts with a simple question.

26:21.714 --> 26:24.517
What if Persikof didn't skip?

26:25.385 --> 26:26.419
But he did skip.

26:26.486 --> 26:27.820
Humor me for one second.

26:27.887 --> 26:30.022
How much additional bail would be set?

26:30.089 --> 26:32.559
I don't know. Uh, 100,000, 150.

26:32.625 --> 26:35.695
Which means you would get
another $10 to $15,000, right?

26:39.799 --> 26:41.368
When the judge asks why you skipped,

26:41.401 --> 26:42.702
what do you say?

26:42.769 --> 26:44.871
I didn't skip. I got the dates wrong.

26:44.937 --> 26:46.706
What did the police report say?

26:46.773 --> 26:50.377
Whatever that awful bail
woman said is a lie.

26:50.443 --> 26:51.944
Uh, well, you know,

26:52.011 --> 26:54.681
the police report didn't say much. Why?

26:54.747 --> 26:56.282
- Nothing about New York?
- Ma.

26:56.383 --> 26:57.784
[beeping]

26:57.850 --> 27:00.553
Is there something I should know about?

27:00.620 --> 27:01.588
No.

27:05.992 --> 27:07.059
Excuse me.

27:15.267 --> 27:17.770
I'm guessing you're mad at me.

27:17.837 --> 27:19.739
Why would I be mad at you, Lance?

27:19.806 --> 27:21.408
I was just trying to help you out.

27:21.474 --> 27:22.709
A client with bogus collateral.

27:22.775 --> 27:24.243
Okay, now, I didn't know that.

27:24.310 --> 27:25.445
Wanted for murder in New York.

27:25.512 --> 27:26.713
- What?
- You gonna pretend

27:26.779 --> 27:28.180
you didn't know about that?

27:28.247 --> 27:29.916
You honestly think I
would send you a murderer?

27:29.982 --> 27:31.884
Nothing you could do would surprise me.

27:31.951 --> 27:33.252
Is that why we're here?

27:33.319 --> 27:34.754
That's not why we're here, right?

27:34.821 --> 27:36.222
- Who's he?
- Hi. I'm Pete.

27:36.288 --> 27:37.256
Pete Murphy.

27:37.323 --> 27:39.191
Who is Pete Murphy?

27:39.258 --> 27:40.927
My long-lost cousin.

27:43.129 --> 27:44.531
Yeah, okay.

27:44.597 --> 27:46.433
If you have anything more
to accuse me of,

27:46.433 --> 27:47.700
can you make it quick?

27:47.767 --> 27:49.436
My client's bail hearing
is about to start.

27:49.436 --> 27:51.203
We know, and before
it does, we'd like you

27:51.270 --> 27:52.572
to ask your client a question

27:52.639 --> 27:54.206
about what happened the other night.

27:54.273 --> 27:56.643
See, I got hit in the head,

27:56.709 --> 27:58.645
and my mem...
my memory's all scrambled up.

27:58.711 --> 28:01.614
I can't remember if we were
running your client to ground

28:01.681 --> 28:03.315
because he was trying to skip

28:03.450 --> 28:06.318
or if it was all just
an innocent mistake.

28:06.453 --> 28:07.554
I can't remember

28:07.620 --> 28:09.321
if your client took my cousin's gun

28:09.456 --> 28:10.723
and his mother suggest that he shoot her

28:10.790 --> 28:12.459
or if it was all very amicable,

28:12.492 --> 28:15.995
ending in me unfortunately but innocently

28:16.062 --> 28:17.764
suffering a blow to my face.

28:17.830 --> 28:20.299
So if you could just ask your client

28:20.366 --> 28:21.801
which version is correct.

28:21.868 --> 28:23.603
Honestly, I just want my memory back

28:23.670 --> 28:24.904
because, in the end,

28:24.971 --> 28:26.506
is there anything more
important than memories?

28:26.573 --> 28:28.741
Yes, there are more important things,

28:28.808 --> 28:30.009
like not getting disbarred.

28:30.076 --> 28:31.644
Oh, Lance, you know, if you don't feel

28:31.711 --> 28:32.879
like you can sell it...

28:32.945 --> 28:33.980
Oh, Cousin Pete,

28:34.046 --> 28:35.848
you really think goading
me is going to work?

28:35.915 --> 28:38.518
- No. I'm not...
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

28:38.585 --> 28:39.919
You owe me.

28:41.488 --> 28:42.822
<i>Bailiff: All rise.</i>

28:47.093 --> 28:48.360
Practice your signals.

28:48.495 --> 28:50.062
- [laughing]
- Yes, sir.

28:52.499 --> 28:53.700
- Hey.
- What?

28:53.766 --> 28:55.735
- Going on a break.
- Yeah, yeah. Good idea.

28:55.802 --> 28:57.504
I'm gonna grab a Sixer
and watch the game.

28:57.570 --> 28:59.706
- You want to come?
- Ah, no. I'm gonna...

28:59.772 --> 29:00.940
Sit here and worry?

29:01.007 --> 29:02.942
Yeah. Well, one of us has to, you...

29:03.009 --> 29:04.010
All right.

29:05.344 --> 29:07.179
Hey, go easy tonight.

29:07.246 --> 29:08.247
Yeah.

29:08.314 --> 29:09.516
Yeah.

29:13.520 --> 29:15.387
<i>- Vince: So, Karolina.</i>
- Huh.

29:15.522 --> 29:17.323
- Where do you live?
- Downtown.

29:17.389 --> 29:19.526
Oh, yeah? Can I give you a ride?

29:20.960 --> 29:22.829
That... That is most appreciated.

29:22.895 --> 29:25.064
Sure. Here.
It's a little chilly out there.

29:25.131 --> 29:26.733
Let me help you with it.

29:27.734 --> 29:29.802
You know, that accent of yours.

29:32.739 --> 29:34.073
When I was a kid,

29:34.140 --> 29:35.575
I had this mad crush

29:35.642 --> 29:37.577
on Natasha from "Bullwinkle."

29:37.644 --> 29:40.613
- [whistle]
- What is, uh, Bullwinkle?

29:41.548 --> 29:42.882
What is Bullwinkle?

29:42.949 --> 29:44.584
You didn't have Rocky and Bullwinkle...

29:44.651 --> 29:45.852
- No.
- ... the cartoon in Slo...

29:45.918 --> 29:47.153
- Slovenia.
- Slovenia.

29:47.219 --> 29:48.220
Slovenia.

29:48.287 --> 29:49.556
Slovenia.

29:49.556 --> 29:50.723
You see, when I say it,

29:50.790 --> 29:52.559
it sounds like
the armpit of the universe,

29:52.625 --> 29:54.460
but not when you say it.

29:54.561 --> 29:56.596
It just sounds like Utopia.

29:56.663 --> 29:58.164
- Stop it.
- No, I'm not kidding you.

29:58.230 --> 29:59.198
You're too much.

29:59.265 --> 30:00.332
I'm too much?

30:00.399 --> 30:01.500
But do tell me,

30:01.568 --> 30:03.035
what is this Bullwinkle?

30:03.102 --> 30:04.971
Bullwinkle was a moose.

30:13.613 --> 30:15.414
Hey, pal, you got the time?

30:15.481 --> 30:16.949
Yeah.

30:17.016 --> 30:18.084
Fuck!

30:21.287 --> 30:22.354
Hello, Eddie.

30:22.421 --> 30:25.257
My name is Detective Frank Winslow.

30:25.324 --> 30:26.559
I know the con

30:26.626 --> 30:28.194
you and your brother are running.

30:28.260 --> 30:30.663
I also know you don't tell the truth.

30:30.730 --> 30:32.331
The next time you get this close

30:32.398 --> 30:33.866
to an alcoholic beverage,

30:33.933 --> 30:35.902
it'll be when your cellie shares the wine

30:35.968 --> 30:37.904
he just made in the toilet.

30:44.844 --> 30:47.980
We just made $20,000!

30:48.047 --> 30:49.949
[laughing]

30:50.016 --> 30:53.285
Oh, I can't believe
Judge Banks bought it.

30:53.352 --> 30:54.553
Yeah.

30:54.621 --> 30:56.288
I got a question.

30:56.355 --> 30:57.423
Yeah.

30:57.489 --> 30:58.925
If the company's so strapped,

30:58.991 --> 31:00.492
how do you guys post bail?

31:00.559 --> 31:02.128
That's where the line of credit comes in.

31:02.194 --> 31:03.129
Oh. Right. Yeah.

31:03.195 --> 31:05.632
Okay, so what now? You take the money?

31:05.632 --> 31:07.399
You put it in the safe with the rublies?

31:07.466 --> 31:08.935
No. After they finish the paperwork,

31:09.001 --> 31:11.037
I get a check and deposit it in the bank.

31:12.739 --> 31:14.206
Okay, so for my cut...

31:14.273 --> 31:15.474
And then you get your cut.

31:15.541 --> 31:16.508
Worth every penny.

31:16.643 --> 31:18.310
Very smart play, Cousin Pete.

31:18.377 --> 31:20.412
But I was wondering if
I could get that in cash

31:20.479 --> 31:21.814
- if possible.
- Uh...

31:21.881 --> 31:23.349
What?

31:23.415 --> 31:26.518
The Persikofs have decided
to bond out with A&B.

31:26.653 --> 31:29.421
A&B? They... They... They can't do that.

31:29.488 --> 31:30.522
We... We had a deal.

31:30.657 --> 31:32.558
We had a deal, you and me.

31:32.659 --> 31:34.560
But they just fired me as their attorney.

31:34.661 --> 31:36.696
I'm sorry, Julia.

31:36.763 --> 31:40.499
Lance, you better run now

31:40.566 --> 31:41.934
before I punch you in the dick.

31:42.001 --> 31:43.670
- Julia, I just...
- I...

31:43.703 --> 31:45.672
I'm going, but I am walking.

31:52.178 --> 31:54.313
Is he the guy with
the suits in the closet?

31:56.215 --> 31:57.684
We had Jacob.

31:57.717 --> 31:59.819
We were together another year, and...

31:59.886 --> 32:01.153
And then he cheated on you.

32:01.220 --> 32:03.690
Yeah, you should have
punched him in the dick.

32:04.590 --> 32:06.092
So now what?

32:06.158 --> 32:07.559
Now...

32:07.694 --> 32:10.529
I have to go tell Audrey.

32:10.596 --> 32:12.899
[thunder]

32:17.069 --> 32:18.738
This is new.

32:18.805 --> 32:22.374
I've already said it to
you on many occasions.

32:22.441 --> 32:25.077
It appears to have had no effect.

32:25.144 --> 32:26.879
I'm sorry, Audrey.

32:26.946 --> 32:30.783
So you've said before on many occasions.

32:32.518 --> 32:33.619
Well, okay, then.

32:33.720 --> 32:35.154
What I don't get

32:35.221 --> 32:37.323
is how you could in good conscience

32:37.389 --> 32:38.725
risk your brother's career.

32:38.725 --> 32:40.059
Here we go.

32:40.126 --> 32:41.728
You want to perjure yourself,
that's one thing.

32:41.794 --> 32:42.729
I didn't perjure myself.
I didn't testify.

32:42.795 --> 32:44.496
Taylor put a man in custody

32:44.563 --> 32:45.732
wanted in New York for murder,

32:45.765 --> 32:46.966
and he doesn't know.

32:47.033 --> 32:48.768
When this comes out, it could ruin him.

32:48.835 --> 32:50.002
I did it for Taylor.

32:50.069 --> 32:52.471
And you and Grandpa and Carly.

32:52.538 --> 32:55.574
I'm just trying to keep
this sinking ship afloat.

32:55.641 --> 32:57.409
And admit it. If it had worked,

32:57.476 --> 32:58.477
you'd have been thrilled.

32:58.544 --> 33:00.980
But it didn't work, did it?

33:01.047 --> 33:02.448
[scoff]

33:02.514 --> 33:03.582
At least not yet.

33:03.649 --> 33:05.584
Maybe we can salvage something

33:05.651 --> 33:07.754
from this sow's ass.

33:07.820 --> 33:09.789
Get Persikof to switch back to us.

33:10.757 --> 33:11.958
Let me get my purse.

33:14.994 --> 33:17.563
Thanks for jumping in
and sticking up for me, Pete.

33:17.629 --> 33:19.766
I'm not suicidal.

33:20.867 --> 33:23.669
Thank you for agreeing to see me.

33:23.770 --> 33:25.905
We have a lot in common, you and I,

33:25.972 --> 33:28.875
both having children who... well,

33:28.941 --> 33:30.542
the old term was "wayward."

33:30.609 --> 33:32.578
I had two daughters.

33:32.644 --> 33:35.147
One's still alive... Pete's mom.

33:35.214 --> 33:38.785
God knows where.
We haven't spoken in 20 years.

33:38.851 --> 33:42.254
The other one, my dear Lila,

33:42.321 --> 33:44.456
was killed in a car
accident with her husband

33:44.523 --> 33:46.092
12 years ago now.

33:46.158 --> 33:50.429
Lila's daughter was in
school when her parents died.

33:51.630 --> 33:53.165
She dropped out, went to the city,

33:53.232 --> 33:55.467
put half of Peru up her nose,

33:55.534 --> 33:58.004
had a child out of wedlock.

33:58.070 --> 33:59.806
Anyway, I know what it's like

33:59.839 --> 34:01.407
- to have...
- Let me stop you there.

34:01.473 --> 34:03.042
I know what you're doing...

34:03.109 --> 34:04.811
trying to tug at my heartstrings,

34:04.844 --> 34:07.113
using your grandchildren as props.

34:07.179 --> 34:09.447
But it would really be
best for all concerned

34:09.514 --> 34:11.483
if you just fucked off.

34:13.685 --> 34:15.121
Before I go,

34:15.187 --> 34:17.389
I want you to think about two people.

34:17.456 --> 34:18.824
Two people.

34:19.992 --> 34:22.661
Joe Paterno and Bill Cosby.

34:22.728 --> 34:24.530
Uh, maybe it's my age,

34:24.596 --> 34:25.965
but I've been thinking a lot

34:26.032 --> 34:28.967
about how some stories end.

34:29.034 --> 34:30.502
Who could ever imagine

34:30.569 --> 34:32.404
that the beloved Paterno...

34:32.471 --> 34:35.107
JoePa, for God's sake...

34:35.174 --> 34:38.643
would end his days in such a shadow?

34:38.710 --> 34:40.847
And then there's Cosby.

34:40.913 --> 34:44.449
Bill Cosby. Look how his story's ending.

34:44.516 --> 34:47.119
Are you threatening to
ruin my son's reputation?

34:47.186 --> 34:49.989
Your son's reputation is already ruined.

34:50.056 --> 34:51.858
And his story will no doubt end

34:51.924 --> 34:53.458
with a heart attack in prison

34:53.525 --> 34:55.995
or a bullet to his head
in a winter's field.

34:56.062 --> 34:58.264
No, Mrs. Persikof, I'm talking about you.

35:00.366 --> 35:01.868
In one version,

35:01.868 --> 35:04.170
you convince your son

35:04.236 --> 35:06.705
to have us bond his additional bail,

35:06.772 --> 35:08.908
and your story goes on as before.

35:08.975 --> 35:10.576
You're the Employer Of the Year,

35:10.642 --> 35:11.978
loved by her community.

35:12.044 --> 35:14.546
In the other version,

35:14.613 --> 35:16.282
you fuck us over,

35:16.348 --> 35:18.717
we sue you and your son in civil

35:18.784 --> 35:20.219
for what happened the other night.

35:20.286 --> 35:23.189
And at trial,
everyone in the tri-state area

35:23.255 --> 35:25.124
finds out that you told your son

35:25.191 --> 35:26.658
to shoot my granddaughter,

35:26.725 --> 35:28.494
and that will be just the beginning.

35:28.560 --> 35:31.463
We will drag you through a
hellscape of public humiliation

35:31.530 --> 35:34.700
until you either decide to try
to start over somewhere else

35:34.766 --> 35:37.203
or you make the smart decision...

35:38.170 --> 35:39.906
and sit in your garage

35:39.939 --> 35:41.640
listening to some soothing light jazz

35:41.707 --> 35:43.109
on the car radio

35:43.175 --> 35:44.510
while the engine runs

35:44.576 --> 35:49.781
and you await the sweet release of death.

35:49.916 --> 35:52.518
Cheating bastard.

35:52.584 --> 35:53.752
Aah!

35:53.819 --> 35:55.354
Bang.

35:58.991 --> 36:01.627
- Really?
- The gun is hard to get to.

36:01.693 --> 36:03.963
That's because you're a
fucking fat-ass, Charlie.

36:04.030 --> 36:06.032
Hey, hey, you told me
to put on a few pounds.

36:06.098 --> 36:08.367
Few being the operative word,
not a shit-ton.

36:08.434 --> 36:09.936
- Look at you.
- Stop it.

36:09.936 --> 36:11.570
Stop it.

36:11.637 --> 36:12.638
All right, let's do it again.

36:12.704 --> 36:13.940
- Ah.
- Oh, you know,

36:13.940 --> 36:15.942
I think you should
scream a little louder.

36:16.008 --> 36:17.944
You know, a guy gets shot, all right?

36:17.944 --> 36:19.011
- All right, all right.
- All right.

36:19.078 --> 36:20.312
- All right.
- All right.

36:21.213 --> 36:22.949
Uh, all right, from the pull.

36:22.949 --> 36:24.183
Okay. Ready?

36:26.485 --> 36:28.220
Aah!

36:31.490 --> 36:33.359
Wow. What a performance.

36:33.425 --> 36:36.462
I mean, really, really captivating.

36:36.528 --> 36:38.530
- Hey, how you doing?
- Good. How are you?

36:38.597 --> 36:40.799
Yeah, I'm good. Uh...

36:40.866 --> 36:42.601
- Marius.
- Th-this is, uh...

36:42.668 --> 36:43.769
Marius, just don't...

36:43.835 --> 36:45.571
don't bother. You're blown.

36:47.406 --> 36:48.507
[whistle]

36:55.781 --> 36:57.583
Fuck, Marius, I'm sorry, man.

36:57.649 --> 36:59.551
This fucking cop bribed me,
and he said he knew...

36:59.618 --> 37:00.686
Eddie, he's not a real cop.

37:00.752 --> 37:02.654
No, actually, he is a real cop,

37:02.721 --> 37:04.356
but he's an expensive one, too,

37:04.423 --> 37:06.692
but that's what quality costs.

37:06.758 --> 37:08.060
It's not my fault, Marius.

37:08.127 --> 37:09.228
Vince already knew.

37:09.295 --> 37:11.030
Well, no, I didn't know,

37:11.097 --> 37:13.165
but I had a pretty good idea.

37:13.232 --> 37:14.266
Hmm?

37:15.267 --> 37:17.603
Slovenia? Slovakia? You said both.

37:17.669 --> 37:19.705
I only said Slo-Slovenia.

37:20.839 --> 37:22.041
Did you hear that, Eddie?

37:22.108 --> 37:23.909
Did you hear how she stuck to her guns?

37:24.010 --> 37:27.079
You never drop the con. She's a pro.

37:27.146 --> 37:28.880
Oh. By the way,

37:29.015 --> 37:30.616
what's the capital of Slovenia?

37:39.025 --> 37:42.361
Oh. Beep. Time's up.

37:42.428 --> 37:43.462
Shit.

37:43.529 --> 37:45.164
I-I'm sorry, Mar...

37:45.231 --> 37:46.765
No, it's okay. It's okay.

37:46.832 --> 37:48.034
Vince, I...

37:49.068 --> 37:50.069
I know you're upset...

37:50.136 --> 37:51.470
Upset? I don't...

37:51.537 --> 37:53.072
I don't think I am.

37:53.139 --> 37:55.041
I mean, do I look upset?

37:55.107 --> 37:57.476
No. See? I'm not upset.

37:57.543 --> 37:59.145
I'm just... I'm just...

37:59.211 --> 38:01.080
I'll tell you, though, I am very curious

38:01.147 --> 38:03.649
about how this was all going to go down.

38:03.715 --> 38:06.052
So you were going to get me

38:06.052 --> 38:08.287
to keep putting my money on the table,

38:08.354 --> 38:12.424
supposedly drawing
the whale in deeper, hmm?

38:12.491 --> 38:14.093
And then the whale spots the cheat.

38:14.160 --> 38:17.463
The cheat and the whale
have what, a shoot-out?

38:17.529 --> 38:18.464
That's it?

38:19.531 --> 38:20.332
- Huh?
- Yeah.

38:20.399 --> 38:22.068
How do you get the money, though?

38:25.104 --> 38:27.439
The cops come in, they arrest you, and...

38:27.506 --> 38:29.308
and before you figured it out, we...

38:29.375 --> 38:30.809
- Ah.
- ... we get away.

38:30.876 --> 38:32.078
Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh.

38:32.111 --> 38:34.080
So it's basically The Sting.

38:34.080 --> 38:36.182
Yeah, it's loosely based on The...

38:36.248 --> 38:39.085
- Loosely based?
- Hey, shut up, Eddie.

38:39.118 --> 38:41.120
It's loosely based on The Sting.

38:41.187 --> 38:43.689
Go with the classic. Why not?

38:45.824 --> 38:47.259
Let me see the gun.

38:49.661 --> 38:51.397
Show him the goddamn gun.

38:51.463 --> 38:52.964
Charlie, show him the gun.

38:53.099 --> 38:55.201
They're blanks. Jesus.

38:57.103 --> 38:59.271
It's... This guy.

38:59.338 --> 39:01.207
You know the problem with blanks, though?

39:01.273 --> 39:04.910
They don't sound like a real bullet.

39:04.976 --> 39:06.812
Here. Blank.

39:09.615 --> 39:11.817
Now compare that to the real bullet.

39:11.883 --> 39:13.785
Oh! Aah!

39:13.852 --> 39:15.654
Aah!

39:17.556 --> 39:19.725
- Do you hear the difference?
- Oh! Aah!

39:19.791 --> 39:20.859
Huh?

39:20.926 --> 39:22.128
Let me go over it again.

39:22.194 --> 39:23.829
- Aah!
- Here's the blank.

39:23.895 --> 39:24.896
[screaming]

39:24.963 --> 39:26.232
Here's the real bullet.

39:29.235 --> 39:31.770
It's subtle, but it is there.

39:31.837 --> 39:34.773
It has more of a...

39:34.840 --> 39:36.142
oh, what would you call it?

39:36.208 --> 39:39.145
A solid pop sound.

39:39.211 --> 39:42.714
Did you recognize that, Marius?

39:43.949 --> 39:45.317
Could you tell the difference

39:45.384 --> 39:49.388
between a blank and a bullet?

39:49.455 --> 39:51.357
- [Karolina whimpering]
- Could you?

39:54.993 --> 39:56.428
Need time to think about it?

39:57.529 --> 39:58.564
All right.

40:02.168 --> 40:03.402
Okay.

40:05.371 --> 40:07.038
I don't need these.

40:07.105 --> 40:08.940
All right, now listen.

40:09.007 --> 40:12.010
If any of you idiots...

40:12.077 --> 40:14.513
think of taking this to the cops,

40:14.580 --> 40:19.718
let me remind you that I am
me and you are you, right?

40:19.785 --> 40:22.588
And... Well, frankly, we've
already got the cops here, don't we?

40:22.654 --> 40:26.858
So, Marius, let's get down to business.

40:27.993 --> 40:29.561
Where's my seed money?

40:31.430 --> 40:32.998
- Huh?
- I don't have...

40:33.064 --> 40:34.733
- Speak up, I can't hear you.
- I don't have it.

40:34.800 --> 40:36.134
Where is it?

40:36.202 --> 40:38.537
We... We spent it all in the...

40:38.604 --> 40:40.339
- Yeah?
- ... on this place

40:40.406 --> 40:42.574
and, uh, uh, hiring people...

40:42.641 --> 40:45.811
So you got me...

40:45.877 --> 40:48.714
to pay for my own con?

40:50.081 --> 40:53.819
You motherfucking genius.

40:55.153 --> 40:57.055
Really.

40:57.122 --> 40:59.491
Very clever. Well done.

41:00.826 --> 41:02.694
Although it creates a problem for me

41:02.761 --> 41:04.963
because, you know, I really like money,

41:05.030 --> 41:06.298
especially my own money,

41:06.365 --> 41:10.869
so if I kill the three of you,

41:10.936 --> 41:13.505
then I have to write it off,
and, you know, a businessman,

41:13.572 --> 41:16.041
that would just stick in my craw.

41:16.107 --> 41:17.909
So...

41:17.976 --> 41:20.145
eeny meeny miny moe.

41:20.246 --> 41:23.315
[imitating pointer clicking]

41:25.784 --> 41:27.152
Oh, Eddie.

41:27.253 --> 41:29.255
- Vince...
- Oh, don't...

41:29.255 --> 41:30.922
don't say anything, okay?

41:30.989 --> 41:33.959
Just keep breathing for
as long as you can.

41:34.025 --> 41:35.927
It'll make it easier.

41:35.994 --> 41:38.730
I'm sorry, Eddie.

41:38.797 --> 41:41.867
- I am. I'm sorry, but I...
- [sniffle]

41:41.933 --> 41:43.935
I'm going to have to...

41:44.002 --> 41:45.704
- let you live.
- [deep exhale]

41:49.808 --> 41:52.278
I think I got him. Did I get you?

41:52.278 --> 41:54.880
[laughing] No, I'm gonna let you live.

41:54.946 --> 41:56.782
No, that's good news.
Come on, wipe the tears.

41:56.848 --> 41:57.949
Be a man. Hey.

41:58.016 --> 42:00.452
You're a hell of a dealer, all right?

42:00.519 --> 42:01.720
And the players all love you.

42:01.787 --> 42:03.989
And you can spot a cheat like that.

42:04.055 --> 42:05.524
Okay? So you're valuable to me.

42:05.591 --> 42:07.926
I'm going to
let you work off the hundred K.

42:07.993 --> 42:09.194
It'll take a little while,

42:09.295 --> 42:10.896
but you stick with it. All right?

42:10.962 --> 42:12.598
It's good news. Be happy.

42:15.301 --> 42:17.469
- [Karolina whimpering]
- You.

42:20.306 --> 42:23.208
I don't know what...

42:23.309 --> 42:25.611
I don't know what
I'm going to do about you.

42:27.313 --> 42:29.548
I was really starting to like you,

42:29.615 --> 42:33.985
but now that I found out that
your accent is fake and...

42:34.052 --> 42:35.821
- I don't know how I feel.
- [mouthing]

42:37.656 --> 42:38.990
Calm down.

42:43.329 --> 42:44.530
You.

42:44.596 --> 42:48.834
I know exactly what
I'm gonna do with you.

42:48.900 --> 42:50.135
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

42:50.201 --> 42:52.237
- Fuck you!
- Ow! Ow!

42:52.338 --> 42:54.340
[shouting]

42:54.340 --> 42:55.807
Fuck.

43:00.946 --> 43:02.047
Shit.

43:20.832 --> 43:23.569
Everybody! This is a robbery!

43:23.635 --> 43:26.104
Get down on the fucking floor!

43:26.171 --> 43:28.574
Get down on the fucking floor!

43:29.841 --> 43:31.242
- You! Now!
- [screaming]

43:31.377 --> 43:32.778
Wait.

43:32.844 --> 43:34.580
- What?
- You can't go in.

43:34.646 --> 43:37.749
It's a bank robbery.
I'll go in and kill the fuck

43:37.816 --> 43:39.618
- before anyone gets here.
- What if he takes a hostage?

43:39.685 --> 43:42.053
[police sirens blaring]

43:46.392 --> 43:47.693
<i>Marius: Don't fucking look at me.</i>

43:52.431 --> 43:56.435
Get down! Drop it! Drop it now!

43:56.502 --> 43:58.169
On your knees! Turn around!

43:58.236 --> 43:59.671
Get down! Get down!

43:59.738 --> 44:01.540
Get on your knees right now!

44:05.411 --> 44:06.412
Hands behind your back!

44:06.445 --> 44:08.414
[siren blaring]

44:14.986 --> 44:16.888
Hey, it's done.

44:16.955 --> 44:17.889
Well, it's your money.

44:17.956 --> 44:20.091
Thinking of running again, Abraham?

44:20.158 --> 44:21.960
We've got your mother's house
as collateral this time.

44:22.027 --> 44:24.430
You really want
poor Mommy to lose her home?

44:24.430 --> 44:26.698
All the work I do, I'll just
get another one in six months.

44:26.765 --> 44:28.066
Oh, so you are going to skip.

44:28.133 --> 44:29.334
I'm joking.

44:29.435 --> 44:30.736
I'm not going anywhere.

44:30.802 --> 44:32.203
Sure you are.

44:32.270 --> 44:33.939
You're going to New York.

44:34.005 --> 44:36.007
- Max Peron?
- How you doing, Max?

44:36.074 --> 44:37.443
You miss New York?

44:37.443 --> 44:38.977
Enjoy the sunshine, sweetheart.

44:39.044 --> 44:41.079
You'll be seeing the
underside of the grass soon.

44:41.146 --> 44:42.581
I promise.

44:42.648 --> 44:44.516
Abraham Persikof, aka Max Peron,

44:44.583 --> 44:45.651
you're under arrest.

44:45.717 --> 44:48.319
Pursuant to Article 540-158

44:48.454 --> 44:50.088
of the Connecticut Criminal Code...

45:02.267 --> 45:03.635
- What?
- Uh, no,

45:03.702 --> 45:05.537
I'm just trying to remember a number.

45:05.604 --> 45:08.106
Give me one second, all right?

45:08.173 --> 45:10.542
I gotta make a few calls.

45:16.515 --> 45:17.483
What is that?

45:17.516 --> 45:19.818
A leash for Hush Puppy.

45:19.885 --> 45:22.588
Or that parachute cord
that Dennis will get.

45:23.722 --> 45:25.290
I thought you were making a noose.

45:25.356 --> 45:26.858
[phone buzzes]

45:26.925 --> 45:29.561
You can use it as a choke leash.

45:29.628 --> 45:31.497
Hush Puppy doesn't get
a goddamn choke leash.

45:31.530 --> 45:32.831
Then it's a regular leash. Whatever.

45:32.898 --> 45:34.733
- Just put her on a leash.
- [buzzing continues]

45:34.800 --> 45:37.335
<i>♪ Come on, baby, shake your body ♪</i>

45:37.402 --> 45:39.971
All right, let me see.

45:40.038 --> 45:42.073
It's pretty damn cool,
I'll give you that.

45:42.140 --> 45:43.575
[buzzing]

45:43.642 --> 45:45.376
[sigh] Who the fuck keeps calling me

45:45.511 --> 45:47.713
and hanging up? Shit.

46:00.526 --> 46:02.994
You know, I got to go, uh...

46:04.062 --> 46:05.196
soak it in water

46:05.263 --> 46:07.365
and stretch it out,

46:07.432 --> 46:08.867
let it dry and all that.

46:20.779 --> 46:22.748
No, motherfucker, no.

46:22.814 --> 46:24.249
Don't! Don't! Don't!

46:25.383 --> 46:27.285
Fuck you!

46:27.352 --> 46:28.854
God damn it, Eddie!

46:34.560 --> 46:35.794
[whistle]

46:44.335 --> 46:46.004
[barking]

46:48.439 --> 46:50.175
[barking]

46:51.610 --> 46:53.779
- [rip]
- [shouting]

46:57.649 --> 46:59.951
Maybe we should get Dr. Billy.

47:00.018 --> 47:02.187
Dog bites can be nasty.

47:02.253 --> 47:03.789
Yeah, we'll get Dr. Billy.

47:03.855 --> 47:05.891
That looks like it hurts.

47:05.957 --> 47:07.593
I don't know.

47:07.593 --> 47:09.695
Is one dog bite enough

47:09.761 --> 47:11.329
for you to learn your lesson, Eddie?

47:11.396 --> 47:12.664
Yes.

47:12.731 --> 47:14.600
- You sure?
- Yes.

47:14.600 --> 47:16.902
Yes, yes.

47:16.968 --> 47:19.070
We'd better do the nose.

47:19.137 --> 47:20.071
What?

47:20.138 --> 47:21.072
Ah, come on.

47:21.139 --> 47:22.908
Oh, fuck.

47:22.974 --> 47:24.810
All right, hang on, hang on.

47:24.876 --> 47:27.512
You know what?
Something's really bugging me here.

47:27.613 --> 47:30.782
I thought things between
you and me were good.

47:31.850 --> 47:33.652
I mean, you earned my trust

47:33.719 --> 47:35.320
the past few years.

47:35.386 --> 47:36.988
I gave you your freedom.

47:37.055 --> 47:38.624
And what? Now you're just... pew!

47:38.624 --> 47:40.692
- You take off?
- If I was so freedom,

47:40.759 --> 47:42.861
then why did Richard
sic Hush Puppy on me?

47:42.928 --> 47:46.865
Well, there's free
and then there's free.

47:46.932 --> 47:50.101
No. Something happened, Eddie.

47:50.168 --> 47:52.437
Why run now?

47:52.503 --> 47:54.239
Hmm?

47:55.540 --> 47:56.942
Someone got to you, didn't they?

47:58.777 --> 48:00.278
It was Marius, wasn't it?

48:00.345 --> 48:02.047
He got through to you, huh?

48:02.113 --> 48:04.716
Sent you a warning or a little message

48:04.783 --> 48:07.318
or some code or something like that?

48:07.385 --> 48:09.220
Huh? How did it go down, Eddie?

48:09.287 --> 48:10.689
How'd he do it?

48:13.458 --> 48:15.994
<i>Richard: My phone.</i>

48:16.061 --> 48:16.928
What?

48:16.995 --> 48:18.864
Rang three times in a row.

48:18.930 --> 48:21.366
A number I didn't recognize.

48:23.902 --> 48:24.936
Oops.

48:28.006 --> 48:29.741
Okay. Now we're getting somewhere.

48:29.808 --> 48:31.376
So we know Eddie was warned...

48:31.442 --> 48:33.879
by Marius, undoubtedly.

48:35.413 --> 48:37.348
But...

48:37.415 --> 48:39.017
how did Marius know

48:39.084 --> 48:41.352
that Richie was watching Eddie?

48:43.021 --> 48:45.023
He knows Richard's your best guy.

48:45.090 --> 48:46.925
And he thought you'd put him on Eddie.

48:48.694 --> 48:50.929
What I want to know is how
the hell did he get my number.

48:50.996 --> 48:53.131
I don't give out my number.

48:56.534 --> 48:57.502
Marius.

48:57.568 --> 48:59.705
Come on, Marius.

49:01.172 --> 49:03.008
- Pass code?
- First two numbers

49:03.074 --> 49:05.143
are double upper left...
either two 1s or two 4s.

49:08.714 --> 49:10.348
When Marius does a con,

49:10.415 --> 49:11.717
he gets every number he can.

49:11.783 --> 49:13.719
He figured it out from that stinking

49:13.752 --> 49:15.520
Jim Brown jersey you never take off.

49:15.586 --> 49:18.156
Jim Brown was number 32 in Cleveland

49:18.223 --> 49:20.892
and 44 at Syracuse.

49:20.959 --> 49:23.194
Syracuse and Cleveland it was.

49:23.261 --> 49:25.330
You know he was also a
great lacrosse player?

49:25.396 --> 49:26.732
That's a nice lift.

49:26.765 --> 49:29.034
Yeah. I'll say.

49:29.100 --> 49:32.570
Of course, boy,
that memory of his is impressive.

49:32.637 --> 49:34.405
Really, and that was three years ago.

49:34.472 --> 49:36.541
- Memory palaces.
- Huh?

49:36.607 --> 49:40.645
He builds what he calls
memory palaces in his head.

49:40.746 --> 49:42.247
Memory palaces?

49:43.414 --> 49:44.950
What the fuck is that?

49:45.016 --> 49:47.318
Sounds, uh, fancy.

49:49.387 --> 49:50.621
All right.

49:50.756 --> 49:52.858
What do we know?

49:52.924 --> 49:56.594
We'll, uh, we'll trace the phone.

49:56.661 --> 49:58.429
See if we can get a location back.

49:58.496 --> 49:59.564
But, Marius being Marius,

49:59.630 --> 50:00.766
he probably thought of that,

50:00.766 --> 50:02.067
so...

50:02.133 --> 50:04.169
I guess it's still worth a try.

50:04.235 --> 50:06.137
You've been very helpful, Eddie.

50:06.204 --> 50:07.138
Thank you.

50:10.508 --> 50:11.642
Do the nose.

50:11.709 --> 50:12.978
Oh, fuck.

50:22.653 --> 50:23.688
Thank you.

50:23.755 --> 50:25.223
You earned it.

50:27.158 --> 50:31.496
Hey, uh, I'm sorry about not
sticking up for you earlier

50:31.562 --> 50:33.664
with Audrey.

50:33.731 --> 50:34.800
No problem.

50:34.866 --> 50:35.967
I'm still... I'm still

50:36.034 --> 50:37.769
just sort of catching up on things.

50:39.871 --> 50:42.774
Was she always that mean
to you when we were kids?

50:43.775 --> 50:44.910
No.

50:46.444 --> 50:48.279
I used to get angry and fight with her,

50:48.346 --> 50:51.349
but nothing changed, so why even try?

50:53.952 --> 50:55.420
You still glad you came back?

50:58.589 --> 51:00.225
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

51:05.630 --> 51:09.200
Pete, your memories of this place...

51:09.267 --> 51:12.037
it hasn't been like that since...

51:13.138 --> 51:15.306
well, since you and your mom left.

51:17.042 --> 51:18.676
I don't know what you expected to find,

51:18.743 --> 51:20.045
but it's not here anymore.

51:20.111 --> 51:21.880
I mean, I'm a single mom

51:21.947 --> 51:24.515
with two kids by two different dads,

51:24.582 --> 51:27.418
making about $1.98 an hour

51:27.485 --> 51:30.155
working for a grandmother
who treats me like shit.

51:30.221 --> 51:34.492
Your cousin Taylor is a man-child

51:34.559 --> 51:35.861
who says he wants to grow up

51:35.894 --> 51:37.863
but still acts like a 16-year-old.

51:37.863 --> 51:40.065
And then you have an
actual 16-year-old cousin

51:40.131 --> 51:41.900
who thinks Taylor's
the only one who knows

51:41.967 --> 51:44.569
she's been pinched a couple
times for shoplifting.

51:44.635 --> 51:48.106
Add to that the family
business is circling the drain.

51:48.173 --> 51:49.440
And...

51:51.109 --> 51:52.777
if I'd known you were coming,

51:52.878 --> 51:55.013
I would have told you
to run for the hills.

52:07.325 --> 52:08.559
[knocking]

52:08.626 --> 52:10.461
[engine starts]

52:22.140 --> 52:24.375
Because this family is fucking crazy.

52:24.442 --> 52:28.013
Uh, you can handle crazy for a few days.

52:28.079 --> 52:29.314
All right? What about the safe?

52:29.380 --> 52:30.982
They just keep collateral in there...

52:31.049 --> 52:32.417
jewelry and silver.

52:32.483 --> 52:34.185
There's nothing even
close to what I need.

52:34.252 --> 52:36.154
You have six days until Vince removes

52:36.221 --> 52:37.522
one of Eddie's fingers.

52:37.588 --> 52:39.925
I... I know that.
All right? I know that.

52:39.958 --> 52:41.126
That is not a lot of time

52:41.192 --> 52:43.094
to go somewhere and start from scratch.

52:43.161 --> 52:44.930
I was thinking Atlantic City.

52:44.996 --> 52:46.831
There's got to be
new people in the casinos

52:46.932 --> 52:48.599
that don't know me, right?

52:48.666 --> 52:50.701
I saw Karolina.

52:50.768 --> 52:52.370
Well? How did she seem?

52:52.437 --> 52:54.239
She seems scared.

52:54.305 --> 52:56.541
She still doesn't want to talk to you.

52:57.842 --> 52:59.577
<i>We might not get her, Marius.</i>

52:59.644 --> 53:03.381
I know how much you want
to pull off the Turk,

53:03.448 --> 53:04.983
<i>but, um,</i>

53:05.050 --> 53:06.617
I don't think we can do it without her.

53:14.825 --> 53:17.228
- Hey.
- Oh, my God.

53:18.296 --> 53:19.764
You scared the shit out of me.

53:19.830 --> 53:20.966
What are you doing?

53:20.999 --> 53:23.301
You're really leaving this time.

53:23.368 --> 53:24.435
Aren't you?

53:26.537 --> 53:27.472
What?

53:28.639 --> 53:29.607
Uh, I'm not leaving.

53:29.674 --> 53:30.641
What do you mean?

53:30.708 --> 53:32.277
Don't lie to me.

53:33.711 --> 53:35.713
I can't stand all the lying.

53:35.780 --> 53:37.248
You, uh...

53:38.483 --> 53:39.784
Hey, don't worry.

53:39.850 --> 53:42.320
They've been asleep for, like, an hour.

53:48.426 --> 53:49.294
Uh, I don't...

53:49.360 --> 53:50.861
- It's mellow.
- I'm not...

53:50.996 --> 53:52.030
No paranoia.

53:52.097 --> 53:53.564
Okay. Yeah. Give it to me.

53:57.902 --> 53:58.869
Can I come with you?

53:59.004 --> 54:00.071
Mm.

54:01.439 --> 54:02.373
I'm just...

54:03.608 --> 54:05.110
[coughing]

54:05.176 --> 54:06.811
I'm just going into the city.

54:06.877 --> 54:08.679
I'm just going into the city tonight.

54:10.615 --> 54:11.782
A few months back,

54:11.849 --> 54:14.085
if I'd had the combo to that safe,

54:14.152 --> 54:17.055
I'd already be long over the horizon.

54:18.023 --> 54:19.290
I say that, but...

54:20.425 --> 54:22.493
Grandma and Grandpa
have one dead daughter

54:22.560 --> 54:26.131
and... another that's dead to them.

54:27.032 --> 54:28.266
No offense.

54:29.134 --> 54:30.535
Me running with their money

54:30.601 --> 54:31.702
wouldn't kill them.

54:33.204 --> 54:34.939
Well, you probably wouldn't get too far

54:35.040 --> 54:37.275
with jewelry and silverware, right?

54:37.342 --> 54:39.144
- The collateral?
- Yeah.

54:39.210 --> 54:41.112
That's nothing.
I'm talking about the cash box.

54:41.179 --> 54:43.048
- The what?
- They still think I'm 6

54:43.114 --> 54:45.050
and don't know
what they're talking about,

54:45.050 --> 54:48.353
but they bonded a guy out a while back,

54:48.419 --> 54:52.223
and he put down the entire
bail amount in cash.

54:52.290 --> 54:58.263
Right now there's, like, $150,000

54:58.329 --> 55:00.231
sitting in that safe.

55:03.601 --> 55:04.735
