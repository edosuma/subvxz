00:02.420 --> 00:08.440
He's the most unsympathetic, selfish
person I've ever met.

00:08.440 --> 00:10.740
I would never touch him.

00:11.240 --> 00:16.260
I told you I won't
have sex before I get married, right?

00:16.300 --> 00:17.600
Jesus!

00:17.600 --> 00:19.600
My brother is a complete psychopath.

00:20.440 --> 00:22.020
Psychopath?

00:23.040 --> 00:25.480
Tell me you didn't sleep with my brother.

00:25.620 --> 00:27.080
I don't know.

00:28.040 --> 00:32.140
You didn't sleep with Nico.
-But he took pictures of me. Naked pictures.

00:32.580 --> 00:34.160
I reported him.

00:35.380 --> 00:37.860
What's the plan?

00:38.100 --> 00:42.820
Are you gonna go around London
being an asshole because your brother is mean?

00:42.900 --> 00:45.300
Because your girl lied to you?

01:39.540 --> 01:41.200
We should just lie here today.

01:44.280 --> 01:45.220
Okay.

02:50.800 --> 02:52.020
What's wrong?

02:53.700 --> 02:54.980
Don't stop.

02:57.460 --> 02:59.380
I need some space, okay?

03:02.500 --> 03:04.300
You don't need space.

03:26.020 --> 03:27.040
Dead serious.

03:34.620 --> 03:36.440
I respect you.

03:38.060 --> 03:39.740
Now you have to respect me.

04:12.520 --> 04:18.260
I had... sex when I was thirteen.

04:28.100 --> 04:40.800
And the guy I had sex with
behaved really shitty afterwards.

04:48.960 --> 04:57.160
So in the spring...
It was not just because of that.

04:59.400 --> 05:01.420
Lots of stuff.

05:05.060 --> 05:09.560
But then I got kind of...

05:13.180 --> 05:14.300
... sick.

05:24.420 --> 05:25.920
So I'm probably just...

05:29.500 --> 05:35.400
... scared that something
like that will happen again.

06:08.960 --> 06:09.740
Hey you...

06:21.520 --> 06:24.860
I'm really damn sorry...

06:28.720 --> 06:30.180
... for what Nico has done.

06:43.900 --> 06:45.780
But it wasn't your fault.

07:00.760 --> 07:06.460
Nothing serious happened,
and he'll be convicted.

07:10.940 --> 07:12.000
Isn't that good?

07:17.500 --> 07:20.080
We have a legal system in Norway.

07:21.920 --> 07:30.940
We just have to trust
that the legal system is fair.

07:41.000 --> 07:44.020
So you don't have to kill him.

07:51.240 --> 07:53.160
You didn't kill him, did you?

07:58.160 --> 07:59.440
I haven't seen him.

08:02.160 --> 08:03.480
I went to London.

08:12.120 --> 08:14.220
Is he in Oslo?

08:15.980 --> 08:17.060
Don't know.

08:18.820 --> 08:20.480
I haven't been to the apartment.

08:31.500 --> 08:38.400
Is it you who has
been living in our basement?

08:41.360 --> 08:47.800
There really is someone
who's living in our basement.

08:51.060 --> 08:52.760
So damn creepy.

08:55.080 --> 08:56.300
I know!

08:58.940 --> 09:02.300
I stayed with Chris.
I'll keep staying with Chris.

09:06.640 --> 09:08.740
You can live here, too.

09:12.920 --> 09:14.940
But you have to...

09:17.920 --> 09:22.060
... go back to the apartment sometime.

09:29.360 --> 09:30.960
I can't meet Nico.

09:38.200 --> 09:39.600
I can come with you.

09:45.220 --> 09:47.180
I'm not scared of him.

11:05.720 --> 11:06.740
Hello?

11:52.140 --> 11:53.100
He's not here.

12:04.400 --> 12:06.020
What do you wanna do now?

12:07.700 --> 12:08.960
Leave again.

12:12.060 --> 12:15.340
Don't you want to be here for awhile?
-Why should I?

12:16.800 --> 12:19.220
You have to take back your apartment.

12:22.740 --> 12:23.900
I can't live here.

12:25.900 --> 12:26.700
You...

12:28.360 --> 12:36.220
You need to give in now. You can't
run from your brother for the rest of your life.

12:37.160 --> 12:39.940
You just have to face him.

12:40.760 --> 12:47.000
You have to look him in the eye
and tell him he's a fucking loser.

12:48.620 --> 12:50.180
Be done with it.

12:55.060 --> 12:56.560
That's not how it works.

12:58.640 --> 13:02.180
I don't know what I
would have done if I had met him now.

13:12.300 --> 13:14.140
Where will you move to?

13:16.060 --> 13:17.440
I'll buy a new apartment.

13:25.740 --> 13:27.380
You have money for that?

13:30.660 --> 13:31.980
It'll work itself out.

13:34.820 --> 13:40.080
So your solution
is to buy a new apartment?

13:43.360 --> 13:44.020
Yes.

14:05.180 --> 14:06.680
Do you want to move in with me?

14:24.600 --> 14:25.320
Say yes.

14:32.920 --> 14:34.040
William...

14:38.340 --> 14:43.280
Can you not for once stop giving a damn about
what's right and wrong, and just do what you want?

14:59.480 --> 15:00.560
Okay.

15:05.940 --> 15:07.500
We'll move in together!

15:08.320 --> 15:09.720
We'll move in together.

15:53.340 --> 15:54.600
Don't stop.

15:57.460 --> 15:59.180
You don't need to.

16:10.760 --> 16:11.920
What's that?

16:32.440 --> 16:33.300
William!

16:39.540 --> 16:43.920
Summons for interrogation.
Friday, 3rd of June. At 3 o' clock.

16:47.340 --> 16:48.640
Why?

16:54.140 --> 16:59.360
Because I smashed a bottle on that
guy's head. There's a video of it.

17:46.080 --> 17:50.880
Why did you guys stop
talking when I came over?

17:57.720 --> 17:59.780
Have you received a letter from the police?

18:02.120 --> 18:03.480
No.

18:04.820 --> 18:06.020
Have you?

18:09.900 --> 18:16.220
We've been summoned for questioning about the
fight on the night of the bus party. They called our parents.

18:16.460 --> 18:20.380
Mom snapped completely.
-Mine too.

18:24.380 --> 18:26.860
Why was I not summoned?

18:27.360 --> 18:32.940
Probably because you left
before the police arrived. They took our names.

18:33.040 --> 18:37.660
They came across the video on the internet.
The police reported the case themselves.

18:41.640 --> 18:46.180
But it's good that you weren't summoned.
It prevents you from having to testify against William.

18:52.420 --> 18:58.420
Will you guys testify against William?

19:03.700 --> 19:06.920
What should we do?
We can't lie to the police.

19:07.240 --> 19:09.060
We can refuse to say anything.

19:09.200 --> 19:13.000
Yeah, we have the right to remain silent.

19:13.180 --> 19:18.020
They can't convict him based
on just that video anyway.

19:19.620 --> 19:26.020
The quality is bad and it's unfocused.

19:27.660 --> 19:34.240
We really have to think this through carefully.
He could go to prison for six months. I Googled it.

19:34.680 --> 19:39.140
This all started when William did something good.
-How so?

19:39.520 --> 19:45.300
In the winter William beat up a Yakuza guy
for calling Iben, Chris' ex-girlfiriend, a cheap whore.

19:45.300 --> 19:50.260
To get revenge he beat up three
Penetrator guys. And William did nothing.

19:50.420 --> 19:56.040
They beat up Jonas. Then Chris and Isak
planned to beat up Yakuza on the night of the bus party.

19:56.200 --> 19:58.360
William didn't know anything about it.

19:58.640 --> 20:00.680
But he ended up having to get involved.

20:04.460 --> 20:08.280
Can't we tell them this story?

20:08.940 --> 20:15.640
I don't think that's how it works. They're only interested
in who threw the bottle at someone's head.

20:19.700 --> 20:22.220
Why did William
smash that bottle, Noora?

20:25.040 --> 20:27.660
Why?
-Yes.

20:38.380 --> 20:44.520
He smashed it because
he felt it was his fault.

20:44.860 --> 20:52.080
That Yakuza beat
up his best friend.

20:53.560 --> 20:59.820
He's extremely loyal
to the people he loves.

21:02.240 --> 21:04.180
So he did it because...

21:06.580 --> 21:12.860
He doesn't trust the responsibility
with adults, because...

21:15.460 --> 21:21.520
There has never been an
adult who has taken responsibility of him.

21:29.800 --> 21:33.760
He also has a little trouble controlling his mind.

21:34.200 --> 21:37.600
It'd be great if you said that, too.

21:42.040 --> 21:44.980
I say we shut our
mouths at the questioning.

21:46.240 --> 21:47.040
I agree.

21:50.420 --> 21:52.340
Okay, let's do it.

21:57.100 --> 21:59.380
Do you think Isak
and Jonas will say anything?

22:00.120 --> 22:03.300
No, it was William who helped them.

22:03.780 --> 22:06.240
Jonas doesn't even like the police.

22:06.580 --> 22:11.720
The only thing that could fuck
up everything, is if the Yakuza testifies against him.

22:39.580 --> 22:40.660
Eskild?

22:46.920 --> 22:48.500
Eskild!

22:51.060 --> 22:51.740
What?

22:54.360 --> 22:59.660
I don't know who you've got
living down in our basement..

23:00.100 --> 23:08.720
But it has to stop. We've gotten
complaints from our downstairs neighbors.

23:10.360 --> 23:13.460
I don't know anything about it.
It's not me.

23:16.760 --> 23:22.300
Is it Tito?
Or Nito?

23:23.540 --> 23:28.740
I don't know anything about it.
It could be Linn.

23:32.420 --> 23:34.240
It's your bedding.

23:36.140 --> 23:37.740
No, it's not.

23:41.780 --> 23:46.800
You know what bedding is mine? Stalker.

23:46.800 --> 23:50.540
Eskild, I'm the only
one who washes bedding in this house.

23:51.800 --> 23:59.800
Had it not been for me,
your bedding would be full of stiff, old cum.

24:04.100 --> 24:05.560
What's this?

24:07.040 --> 24:10.280
Did you just say
stiff, old cum?

24:13.440 --> 24:14.480
Wow!

24:15.260 --> 24:16.600
Way to go, girl!

24:17.360 --> 24:18.240
Dirty.

24:18.520 --> 24:22.100
Eskild, don't change the subject now!

24:22.100 --> 24:23.380
It's because of William.

24:24.900 --> 24:28.340
No, it's not because of William!

24:28.540 --> 24:31.960
Yes, it is. I can see it in you.
You think in a more sexual way.

24:32.120 --> 24:35.120
Good job, William. Applause!
From one guy to another.

24:35.340 --> 24:37.960
He got them juices flowin', Willy!

24:39.080 --> 24:41.760
Fuck, Eskild. Shut up!

24:42.440 --> 24:43.860
Did you guys have sex?

24:44.380 --> 24:45.760
No!

24:47.320 --> 24:53.860
You're gonna have it now!
You're so horny now, help!

24:55.340 --> 24:56.740
Didn't you see the video?

24:57.600 --> 24:59.740
Are you kidding me now?

24:59.940 --> 25:02.040
"Skogtur". On Google. Search for "Skogtur".

25:02.900 --> 25:07.500
You can watch it with William. Foreplay.
-Bye, Eskild.

25:08.240 --> 25:10.020
Stop having people live in the basement.

25:17.700 --> 25:18.940
Eskild!

25:21.520 --> 25:23.400
Yes? "Skogtur"

25:29.120 --> 25:33.840
Say hi to Tito and tell
him to find himself a new place to live.

25:34.460 --> 25:35.060
Yeah.

25:35.900 --> 25:40.060
But let me know if you're going to watch
that video. It's been a long time since I've seen it.

25:40.260 --> 25:43.500
It's quite cool to watch it together.
-Bye!

26:09.680 --> 26:19.760
<i>[Who did you get the number from?]</i>

26:35.160 --> 26:41.540
<i>[Eva got it from Iben who got it from the guy's ex.]</i>

26:50.080 --> 26:56.980
<i>[Okay. Wish me luck.]</i>

27:06.420 --> 27:08.340
Hey you...
-Hm?

27:09.920 --> 27:12.180
Why do you actually
write Noora with two O's?

27:13.320 --> 27:14.520
No one else does it.

27:16.960 --> 27:19.280
Eh, you know Vilde...

27:24.300 --> 27:26.700
Yes. I know Vilde...

27:28.560 --> 27:29.420
Yeah...

27:33.540 --> 27:40.520
She just sent me the
number of the Yakuza guy.

27:46.780 --> 27:48.580
Okay, what are you going to do with it?

27:54.420 --> 27:56.920
No, I just thought that...

28:00.000 --> 28:02.040
... maybe you could call him.

28:06.620 --> 28:07.820
Why should I?

28:09.780 --> 28:19.780
So that you could asked him not
to say anything in the interrogation.

28:21.240 --> 28:22.220
No.

28:26.900 --> 28:28.040
William!

28:29.080 --> 28:30.060
Seriously!

28:31.300 --> 28:32.100
Please.

28:33.880 --> 28:35.100
Forget it.

28:36.040 --> 28:38.320
Yeah but listen!

28:38.900 --> 28:41.220
Everyone is keeping their mouth shut.

28:42.400 --> 28:47.520
Your guys, Isak and Jonas, and my friends. Everyone!

28:48.560 --> 28:59.980
If you don't say anything about everything that happened,
they won't say anything about what you did either.

29:02.780 --> 29:03.640
Noora...

29:04.420 --> 29:05.140
No.

29:07.280 --> 29:08.260
Forget it.

29:09.700 --> 29:10.620
Done.

29:30.620 --> 29:39.820
<i>[He refuses to call, so that's fucked.]</i>

29:49.500 --> 29:59.560
<i>[Seriously? Guys are such idiots. Why does he have to be so proud?
We're talking about six months in prison.]</i>

30:02.060 --> 30:03.880
<i>[I know]</i>

30:10.340 --> 30:17.060
<i>[But you can call him...]</i>

30:20.140 --> 30:21.700
Do you want to read to me?

30:26.560 --> 30:27.500
Ibsen?

30:29.260 --> 30:30.160
Please?

30:33.100 --> 30:34.340
Why?

30:34.820 --> 30:41.200
Because I'm excited
to hear Ibsen's story.

30:41.820 --> 30:43.980
Story? The story of Ibsen?

30:44.200 --> 30:46.500
Yes.
-The Ibsen of the story?

30:48.840 --> 30:53.120
There's nothing here.
-There's lots of pages here.

30:54.400 --> 30:56.400
Just read 'em.

30:56.580 --> 30:58.120
Read 'em words?

30:58.280 --> 30:59.580
A Doll's House.

31:00.220 --> 31:02.880
A Doll's House?

31:05.680 --> 31:06.960
Who cares?

31:10.320 --> 31:13.980
Three-act play.
-1879.

31:14.120 --> 31:16.820
No...

31:21.960 --> 31:23.100
You're cute.

31:25.140 --> 31:26.560
Yeah, that's true.

31:33.540 --> 31:38.780
<i>[Hi. You don't know me, but I was there during the fight on the 29th of April.
I just wanted to say that none of the Riot guys or anyone else who was there
will say anything about what happened. As long as you don't say anything.]</i>

31:50.460 --> 31:58.000
<i>[Hi. You don't know me, but I was there during the fight on the 29th of April.
I just wanted to say that none of the Riot guys or anyone else who was there

32:31.360 --> 32:34.820
<i>[We won't say anything.]</i>

32:34.860 --> 32:35.640
Hello.

32:39.220 --> 32:40.500
How did it go?

32:43.020 --> 32:44.180
It went fine.

32:46.020 --> 32:50.880
Yeah, but you were there for four hours.
What did they say?

32:50.920 --> 32:56.420
Did you get the impression
they have a lot of evidence against you?

33:00.360 --> 33:01.400
I confessed.

33:05.380 --> 33:08.820
Why did you... You can't...
Why did you do that?

33:10.200 --> 33:12.840
Hell, do I know?
Maybe it's because of what you said.

33:15.140 --> 33:21.660
What I said?! I said you shouldn't say shit.
That's what I said.

33:34.080 --> 33:42.080
The stuff about Nico. That we should
believe in and trust that we have a fair legal system.

33:44.480 --> 33:45.940
I chose to trust it.

33:50.300 --> 33:51.520
Alternatively...

33:53.240 --> 33:55.100
I could have chosen to not trust it...

33:58.720 --> 34:01.880
... and just kept my mouth shut about it.

34:03.980 --> 34:06.000
But then I'd nearly killed Nico.

34:08.100 --> 34:09.280
If you get what I mean.

34:45.740 --> 34:47.300
But what will happen now?

34:52.880 --> 34:54.620
I have to go to court in a few weeks.

34:56.960 --> 34:58.600
I might have to go to prison.

35:18.120 --> 35:22.080
What do you want to do now?
While you're still free?

35:27.980 --> 35:29.880
What do I want to do now?

35:46.940 --> 35:49.300
I know what I want to do.
-What?

35:51.100 --> 35:55.000
What I want to do now,
is to have a really big party...

35:57.800 --> 36:00.140
... where we get completely wasted.

36:01.500 --> 36:03.620
We'll just crawl around.

36:06.960 --> 36:08.060
Okay.

36:08.560 --> 36:11.200
Yeah.
-Yeah.

36:12.040 --> 36:15.280
Where do you think that's gonna happen?
At my place?

36:18.060 --> 36:20.240
We may as well go
back to that damn apartment.

38:15.340 --> 38:19.120
I'm ready to order. If there's someone else
who wants to...

38:28.840 --> 38:29.900
Eva!

38:32.320 --> 38:36.780
You have to meet Isak!
-Hi! Eskild. -Isak.

38:38.120 --> 38:40.260
And Jonas.
-Hi! Eskild.

38:43.660 --> 38:45.460
I live with him.

38:46.260 --> 38:48.780
We live together.
-No, we live in a house with roommates.

38:48.780 --> 38:50.780
We live together.

38:53.420 --> 38:56.320
[Jonas talking about Eskild's BJ action.]

38:56.400 --> 38:57.920
Huh?
-Yes!

38:57.920 --> 38:59.040
What BJ action?

38:59.940 --> 39:01.860
What day? On Saturday?

39:01.860 --> 39:05.900
No! It was a really long time ago.

39:10.080 --> 39:12.360
I can't remember
everytime I get sucked off.

39:13.820 --> 39:23.000
It's true. If we have fun,
I won't think about it anymore the day after.

39:23.520 --> 39:25.400
Isn't that a good philosophy?

39:25.400 --> 39:26.880
Do your thing!
-Yeah!

39:26.880 --> 39:30.540
Speaking of that jacket...
I know she...

39:34.100 --> 39:39.000
I know she's not the one
who created it, but she sews at the factory.

39:39.460 --> 39:42.800
I met her when I was in Asia.

39:51.000 --> 39:53.220
You look so cool!
-Thank you.

40:32.240 --> 40:35.920
<i>[I like that you're standing there looking at me.]</i>

40:47.480 --> 40:49.640
<i>[You actually hate parties, don't you?]</i>

40:58.280 --> 41:02.560
<i>[I don't HATE it.]</i>

41:11.000 --> 41:14.740
<i>[We don't have to be here.]</i>

41:14.740 --> 41:16.620
<i>[Go to your house and chill?]</i>

41:26.040 --> 41:30.940
<i>[No. That's not what I want.]</i>

41:40.300 --> 41:45.160
<i>[What do you want?]</i>

42:10.340 --> 42:11.780
Chris. Out.

42:13.320 --> 42:15.080
Are you serious now?

42:15.580 --> 42:17.260
Out. Now.

42:17.820 --> 42:18.980
Bro!

42:34.700 --> 42:37.360
I know I should ask you
if you're ready, but I don't care now.

42:39.460 --> 42:40.380
So shut up.

43:24.500 --> 43:26.500
Oh my god!
Kasper!

43:28.240 --> 43:29.280
Kasper!

44:29.320 --> 44:31.520
Is there no life here?!

46:10.600 --> 46:14.100
I think I did something stupid.

46:18.540 --> 46:19.660
What do you mean?

46:28.940 --> 46:32.520
I sent a message to the Yakuza guy.

46:39.940 --> 46:42.000
I knew you were going to do it.

46:48.340 --> 46:49.620
You're not mad?

46:59.060 --> 47:00.340
I would have done the same.

47:17.060 --> 47:20.860
What will Eskild and Linn
say when you tell them you're moving out?

47:26.080 --> 47:30.540
I'm scared to say it.
You have to say it.

47:33.920 --> 47:34.800
Okay.

47:39.440 --> 47:41.720
My god, it'll go well for sure.

47:43.400 --> 47:47.880
They just have to find
someone else who can live in the room.

48:08.000 --> 48:09.880
Oh, cool belt!

48:10.080 --> 48:11.340
Is it?

48:12.060 --> 48:15.300
Are you taking the credit for that belt?

48:15.300 --> 48:17.360
Is it yours?
-Yes, it's Isak's.

48:17.620 --> 48:19.000
Ah, I see.

48:19.640 --> 48:22.340
All his coolest clothes are actually mine.

48:32.000 --> 48:35.000
SKAM LOVES YOU
