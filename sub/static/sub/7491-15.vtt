WEBVTT

00:02.458 --> 00:03.959
Hiyah!

00:04.041 --> 00:05.667
- Oh!
- Yeah!

00:05.750 --> 00:07.667
Did it again. I am on fire!

00:07.750 --> 00:08.959
<i>♪ Fire! ♪</i>

00:10.000 --> 00:10.875
More bricks, Eddie.

00:11.417 --> 00:12.792
Okay, just think, in a couple of hours,

00:12.875 --> 00:14.875
Jack is gonna break the world record

00:14.959 --> 00:17.792
for most bricks broken by anyone under 15.

00:17.875 --> 00:19.583
And I'm breakin' a world record too.

00:19.667 --> 00:22.000
For most bricks wheelbarrowed
from one place to another.

00:22.083 --> 00:23.875
- Right, Rudy?
- Yes, you are.

00:24.375 --> 00:26.000
Oh, no, he's not.

00:28.041 --> 00:29.959
Some of the records
in this book are crazy.

00:30.041 --> 00:31.792
There was a woman in Michigan
who ate her own car.

00:31.875 --> 00:33.375
Come look at this picture.

00:33.834 --> 00:34.709
Wow.

00:34.792 --> 00:36.500
She literally has a trunk in her junk.

00:36.875 --> 00:37.709
Yeah.

00:38.291 --> 00:39.834
Would you let him focus, Kim?

00:39.917 --> 00:41.667
The judge from the burgess
book of world records

00:41.750 --> 00:42.959
is gonna be here in a few hours.

00:43.041 --> 00:45.375
He's right. This is my last chance
to break the record.

00:45.500 --> 00:47.834
After I turn 15 next week,
I won't be eligible.

00:47.917 --> 00:49.917
You know, you getting your name

00:50.000 --> 00:52.709
and, more importantly,
this dojo's name in that record book,

00:52.792 --> 00:54.709
is like the biggest thing
that's ever happened to us.

00:54.959 --> 00:56.834
Come on, Rudy. The biggest?

00:56.917 --> 00:58.917
When I became a sensei, I had two goals,

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
saving the president from a ninja attack,

01:01.083 --> 01:03.000
and getting my dojo's name
in a record book

01:03.083 --> 01:05.333
that's read by millions
of people on their toilets.

01:06.083 --> 01:07.250
I'm out!

01:09.125 --> 01:11.041
What up, yo?

01:11.125 --> 01:12.959
Record breaker in the house.

01:13.458 --> 01:15.166
What record are you gonna break?

01:15.250 --> 01:17.542
A record I've been
training for my whole life.

01:17.625 --> 01:20.375
Yeah, world's longest armpit hair.

01:20.458 --> 01:21.750
Check it.

01:23.333 --> 01:25.125
Wow, that is pretty long.

01:27.375 --> 01:28.500
Please.

01:31.250 --> 01:33.041
Oh, sweet pit hair!

01:33.125 --> 01:34.542
- Oh ho ho!
- I know, right?

01:34.625 --> 01:36.959
Ooh, it's so soft.
What conditioner do you use?

01:37.291 --> 01:39.166
And I'm gonna smash the yo-yo record

01:39.250 --> 01:42.375
for the two-handed synchronized
round-the-world, baby.

01:42.458 --> 01:43.542
Check this out.

Oh, Kim.

02:44.542 --> 02:47.083
The whole mall's talking about Jack.

02:47.166 --> 02:48.709
There hasn't been a buzz like this

02:48.792 --> 02:51.417
since the escalator ripped off
my security pants.

02:52.917 --> 02:54.834
Thanks, Joan. I, uh,

02:54.917 --> 02:56.917
finally got that image out of my head.

02:57.625 --> 02:58.834
Now it's back.

02:58.917 --> 03:02.291
Oh, I can still hear
those construction workers

03:02.417 --> 03:03.834
hootin' and hollerin'.

03:03.917 --> 03:07.125
Begging you to cover up isn't exactly
hootin' and hollerin'.

03:07.917 --> 03:09.750
Well, when you're my age, Kim,

03:09.834 --> 03:12.875
the definition of a hoot
gets mighty loose.

03:15.583 --> 03:17.583
Yeah, I'll see you later, Joan.

03:19.583 --> 03:20.667
Hey, uh, Jack.

03:20.750 --> 03:23.375
I made you something to wear
when you break the record.

03:23.750 --> 03:26.583
Oh, sorta like a good luck bracelet.

03:28.250 --> 03:30.083
Uh... Yeah.

03:30.166 --> 03:32.750
But it's also more of a...

03:32.834 --> 03:34.583
What, like a friendship bracelet?

03:35.208 --> 03:36.458
Uh...

03:36.959 --> 03:38.375
Yeah.

03:38.458 --> 03:40.083
Great! It's finally official.

03:40.166 --> 03:41.583
We're friends.

03:42.125 --> 03:44.667
Jack, you know I think
of us as more than just...

03:45.875 --> 03:47.083
More than just what?

03:48.000 --> 03:49.041
Um...

03:50.166 --> 03:52.166
I don't know. It's just a dumb bracelet.
I gotta go.

03:52.250 --> 03:53.291
Wait, Kim!

03:53.375 --> 03:55.166
Come on, Kim. Wait a second.

03:57.291 --> 03:58.291
Jack!

03:59.625 --> 04:00.834
Are you okay?

04:00.917 --> 04:02.417
Yeah.

04:02.500 --> 04:03.917
I think so.

04:05.625 --> 04:07.709
Just one question, though.

04:08.333 --> 04:09.917
Who are you people?

04:16.959 --> 04:18.625
This is not good.

04:18.709 --> 04:19.709
He's gonna die.

04:19.792 --> 04:20.834
What?

04:20.917 --> 04:22.625
My pen light. His batteries are shot.

04:24.500 --> 04:26.291
Do you really have
to call your pen light "he"?

04:26.792 --> 04:28.583
Listen, Jack's gonna be fine.

04:28.667 --> 04:29.917
But we're gonna have to operate....

04:30.000 --> 04:32.333
-
- on a need-to-know basis.

04:33.917 --> 04:35.458
So here's what you need to know.

04:35.542 --> 04:37.250
We don't have to do any more tests.

04:37.333 --> 04:39.250
Jack only has a minor concussion.

04:39.333 --> 04:40.792
He suffered some memory loss,

04:40.875 --> 04:42.083
but he's probably gonna be fine.

04:42.166 --> 04:43.083
Probably?

04:43.917 --> 04:45.333
Maybe. I don't know.

04:45.417 --> 04:47.375
It's not like medicine's a real science.

04:49.959 --> 04:50.959
Dr. McCrary,

04:51.041 --> 04:53.041
I called Jack's parents,
but they're out of town.

04:53.125 --> 04:54.792
Is there anything that
we can do to help him?

04:54.875 --> 04:56.834
There is one thing you can do
to speed up his recovery.

04:56.917 --> 04:58.875
Talk about the things he's forgotten.

05:00.250 --> 05:01.583
Excuse me.

05:02.291 --> 05:03.417
Yes?

05:04.041 --> 05:05.208
Hello.

05:05.834 --> 05:06.875
What?

05:07.250 --> 05:08.917
Oh, no.

05:09.041 --> 05:10.583
I just lost a patient.

05:10.875 --> 05:12.208
I got this one.

05:12.667 --> 05:15.667
See, it sounds like he's saying
he just lost his patient.

05:15.750 --> 05:18.709
But what he really means
is he just lost cell reception.

05:18.792 --> 05:19.917
No.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.792
My patient is dead, you insensitive punk!

05:26.750 --> 05:28.125
Hey, Jack.

05:28.208 --> 05:30.291
Do you remember last week
when you loaned me 20 bucks?

05:31.375 --> 05:32.917
- No.
- He's fine.

05:33.417 --> 05:34.792
Ow!

05:34.875 --> 05:37.709
Jack, we're gonna help you
get your memory back.

05:37.792 --> 05:40.709
Is there anything that you
can remember about this dojo?

05:43.375 --> 05:44.291
Sorry.

05:44.959 --> 05:46.125
Come on, Jack.

05:46.208 --> 05:47.792
You have to remember this wall.

05:54.709 --> 05:56.083
Gotta go. Sorry about the wall.

05:59.917 --> 06:01.750
Who was that kid?

06:01.834 --> 06:02.834
Jack!

06:03.500 --> 06:04.834
So I'm a karate student.

06:04.917 --> 06:05.834
Oh, no.

06:05.917 --> 06:07.458
This is worse than I thought.

06:07.834 --> 06:09.417
We're gonna have to start from scratch.

06:09.625 --> 06:11.333
You, Jack!

06:11.417 --> 06:13.333
Me, Jerry!

06:13.417 --> 06:15.583
You good at karate!

06:15.625 --> 06:16.917
Me better!

06:19.333 --> 06:20.834
Did this guy also hit his head?

06:22.750 --> 06:24.667
Jack, check out these trophies.

06:25.375 --> 06:26.667
You won half of 'em.

06:26.750 --> 06:28.458
And the other half Rudy bought.

06:28.583 --> 06:30.417
You're holding the one
for poodle grooming.

06:33.083 --> 06:35.041
The point is, you're really good, Jack.

06:38.834 --> 06:39.750
What's the big deal, Jack?

06:39.834 --> 06:41.083
You've done that a thousand times.

06:43.792 --> 06:45.792
Whoa!

07:05.583 --> 07:07.792
Man, I didn't realize I was that good.

07:09.166 --> 07:10.709
I gotta try some of that.

07:10.792 --> 07:11.875
There you go!

07:11.959 --> 07:13.667
See, that's the spirit!

07:20.792 --> 07:21.709
Come on.

07:21.792 --> 07:23.041
Oh!

07:23.125 --> 07:24.333
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

07:24.417 --> 07:25.542
Yo, hey.

07:25.625 --> 07:27.750
Is that how I look when I do karate?

07:28.250 --> 07:29.333
No, Eddie.

07:29.417 --> 07:30.500
You're not that good.

07:32.834 --> 07:34.041
This is awful.

07:34.125 --> 07:35.542
It's so upsetting.

07:35.625 --> 07:38.000
I know a way to help him
get his memory back.

07:40.208 --> 07:41.834
- What are you doing?
- Oh, I'm gonna smack him

07:41.917 --> 07:43.041
in the head to jog his memory.

07:43.125 --> 07:44.000
Give me that!

07:44.083 --> 07:45.041
What, no. It totally works.

07:45.125 --> 07:46.834
I've seen it in a cartoon once.

07:47.542 --> 07:48.417
I'm sorry.

07:48.500 --> 07:49.834
You guys seem really nice,

07:49.917 --> 07:51.750
but I don't know who you are.

07:52.083 --> 07:54.834
Well, maybe if you told me a little bit
about yourselves, I'd remember.

07:55.583 --> 07:56.417
Oh...

07:56.500 --> 07:58.291
I'll get this party started.

07:58.709 --> 07:59.917
Well, I'm Jerry.

08:07.959 --> 08:08.875
Whoo.

08:09.750 --> 08:10.959
Oh. Hey, you guys.

08:11.041 --> 08:12.458
Shouldn't you be in detention

08:12.542 --> 08:14.375
for putting a toll booth
in the boys' bathroom?

08:15.875 --> 08:16.709
I should be.

08:16.792 --> 08:19.083
But when you sit me in the back
and leave a window open,

08:19.709 --> 08:21.875
I'm what they call a flight risk.

08:21.959 --> 08:22.875
Break a board?

08:22.959 --> 08:25.667
I can barely cut
a well-cooked piece of fish.

08:26.041 --> 08:28.166
Just believe in yourself and do it.

08:28.250 --> 08:29.375
I can't.

08:29.458 --> 08:30.792
When I was born, my parents thought

08:30.875 --> 08:33.125
they I'd given birth to a baby bird.

08:33.208 --> 08:34.458
- I mean, that's--
- Do it, Krupnik!

08:34.542 --> 08:36.375
Ahh!

08:38.875 --> 08:41.166
Holy Christmas nuts!

08:45.750 --> 08:47.709
Eddie, I don't know how to tell you this.

08:47.792 --> 08:51.709
But you are never going
to be a good dancer.

08:51.792 --> 08:53.125
Oh, that's okay.

08:53.208 --> 08:54.917
I don't come here for the dancing.

09:02.125 --> 09:03.583
<i>That was technically flawless.</i>

09:03.667 --> 09:05.667
<i>You are a model of efficiency.</i>

09:06.875 --> 09:08.709
Wow, uh, you hear that, Jack?

09:08.792 --> 09:11.291
It called me flawless.

09:13.083 --> 09:15.083
So, anything?

09:19.083 --> 09:21.000
No. Still nothing.

09:22.291 --> 09:24.041
I know what'll help you remember you.

09:24.917 --> 09:26.458
Talking about me.

09:27.458 --> 09:28.959
Oh, I'm more than your sensei.

09:29.041 --> 09:31.000
Father figure, sure.

09:31.083 --> 09:32.875
Role model, you betcha.

09:32.959 --> 09:35.041
Idol? That's you talkin', not me.

09:36.625 --> 09:38.542
Look, I appreciate all
you guys trying to help.

09:38.625 --> 09:40.375
But I don't know the guy
you're talking about

09:40.458 --> 09:42.542
and I'm not gonna be able
to break any kind of record.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.959
I think I know what can help, Jack.

09:46.041 --> 09:47.375
A psychiatric study suggests that--

09:47.500 --> 09:48.750
Oh, forget that.

09:48.834 --> 09:50.250
Just give me one good swing at his head.

09:50.291 --> 09:51.750
No, just let me tell him more about me.

09:51.834 --> 09:53.041
Wait, I know what'll help.

09:53.125 --> 09:54.875
I'll read to him from my friendship diary.

09:55.291 --> 09:56.458
No, that is absurd!

10:01.125 --> 10:02.875
Guys?

10:02.959 --> 10:03.959
Guys? Guys!

10:05.250 --> 10:06.625
Jack's gone!

10:10.583 --> 10:12.208
Oh, this is bad.

10:12.583 --> 10:14.208
Jack has no idea who he is

10:14.291 --> 10:16.792
and he's out there on the streets
of Seaford all alone.

10:16.875 --> 10:18.291
We have to find him!

10:25.834 --> 10:28.000
I'm taking your falafel ball

10:28.083 --> 10:29.667
and there's nothing you can do about it.

10:33.166 --> 10:34.083
<i>Oh.</i>

10:34.834 --> 10:36.083
I'm sorry.

10:36.166 --> 10:37.208
Jack!

10:37.291 --> 10:38.792
I didn't see you there.

10:38.875 --> 10:40.792
Here, man. Take my falafel balls.

10:40.875 --> 10:42.375
I just don't want any trouble.

10:46.667 --> 10:48.417
You're scared of me?

10:49.333 --> 10:50.583
<i>So...</i>

10:50.834 --> 10:54.333
You wouldn't mind if I did this?

10:57.834 --> 10:58.750
And this?

11:00.125 --> 11:01.625
And this?

11:01.709 --> 11:02.750
And this?

11:02.834 --> 11:03.750
And this?

11:03.834 --> 11:05.625
Hey! Careful, Frank!

11:05.875 --> 11:07.750
I hypnotized Jack.

11:09.208 --> 11:11.834
And when I snap my fingers three times,

11:11.917 --> 11:13.125
he'll be back.

11:13.208 --> 11:15.917
And he'll probably wanna
pull your ears off.

11:20.417 --> 11:21.625
Don't do it, man.

11:21.709 --> 11:23.750
I have dreams of being an ear model.

11:30.333 --> 11:32.917
Sorry I ran out, guys.
I just needed a second.

11:33.375 --> 11:34.875
Thanks for saving me, Milton.

11:34.959 --> 11:36.375
You must be the hero of the group.

11:37.458 --> 11:39.458
I have my moments.

11:39.542 --> 11:40.959
There was this one time...

12:04.875 --> 12:06.917
Holy Christmas nuts!

12:07.458 --> 12:09.250
I'm huge!

12:10.667 --> 12:12.583
First of all, that didn't really happen.

12:13.041 --> 12:14.542
And second of all,

12:14.625 --> 12:16.417
there's not just one hero.

12:16.500 --> 12:18.291
We're the wasabi warriors.
We stick together.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.208
Whoo!

12:50.500 --> 12:52.625
Wow! We're a pretty awesome group.

12:52.709 --> 12:54.125
You guys are like ninjas.

12:54.208 --> 12:55.625
-
- Of course we are!

12:55.709 --> 12:56.667
Absolutely. Look at us.

12:56.750 --> 12:57.750
Guys.

12:59.834 --> 13:01.667
We also have our...

13:01.750 --> 13:03.250
Not so ninja moments.

13:03.333 --> 13:05.375
- All the time.
- Every day.

13:05.458 --> 13:07.583
Aww, check out that squirrel up there.

13:07.667 --> 13:08.750
Cute little fella.

13:08.834 --> 13:09.750
Ahh!

13:09.834 --> 13:10.834
Get it off!

13:13.333 --> 13:16.959
I did it! I did it! I did it!

13:17.041 --> 13:17.959
Oh!

13:19.291 --> 13:20.750
-
- Whoa!

13:25.750 --> 13:27.166
She's smiling. I think she's into it.

13:27.250 --> 13:28.250
Whoa!

13:28.291 --> 13:29.542
-
- Oh, no!

13:37.250 --> 13:39.709
Rudy, are you sure
you're doing this right?

13:39.792 --> 13:41.125
Yes.

13:41.208 --> 13:42.625
Now her stomach is filling up with air.

13:42.709 --> 13:44.000
Gently apply some pressure.

13:45.375 --> 13:46.792
<i>Oh!</i>

13:50.792 --> 13:52.625
A little too much pressure, Jack.

13:52.709 --> 13:54.834
Oh, that's too much pressure!

14:06.291 --> 14:07.709
Hey!

14:07.792 --> 14:10.417
You're a cute little fella, aren't you?

14:10.500 --> 14:11.792
How you doin'? I'm doing good.

14:19.250 --> 14:20.542
Guys, guys.

14:20.625 --> 14:21.750
The judge from the burgess book

14:21.834 --> 14:23.750
of world records
is gonna be here any minute.

14:23.834 --> 14:26.458
Lucky for us, I've come up
with a foolproof plan.

14:26.542 --> 14:27.667
Great! What is it?

14:27.750 --> 14:29.625
I made this hand for you
out of a sledgehammer.

14:31.041 --> 14:32.166
Looks perfectly natural.

14:32.250 --> 14:33.959
Now, quick. Just slide it up your sleeve.

14:34.041 --> 14:35.875
And no shaking hands.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.917
And whatever you do, don't salute anyone.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
You'll kill yourself.

14:40.917 --> 14:42.542
This is gonna work, won't it?

14:43.583 --> 14:44.959
Sure. Sure it'll work. It has to work.

14:45.041 --> 14:47.125
Of course it's gonna work.
Somebody tell me it's gonna work.

14:47.208 --> 14:48.834
- It'll work.
- Don't you lie to me.

14:50.291 --> 14:51.750
I gotta get a backup.

14:57.417 --> 14:58.834
Is this guy always like this?

14:58.917 --> 15:00.542
Yeah.

15:00.625 --> 15:02.792
We call it "goin' all Rudy."

15:02.875 --> 15:04.792
What is wrong with you people?

15:04.875 --> 15:08.000
I bought a thousand boxes
of candy for us to sell.

15:08.083 --> 15:10.583
We're doing the best we can, Rudy.

15:21.041 --> 15:22.875
Fire choco-balls!

15:25.166 --> 15:27.166
Fire choco-balls!

15:29.083 --> 15:30.709
Come on! Daddy needs his nuggets.

15:30.792 --> 15:32.083
Come on!

15:44.000 --> 15:46.125
What's up? How's it goin'?

15:46.208 --> 15:47.542
Slap me some ski...

15:47.625 --> 15:49.000
All right, all right. I feel you.

15:50.125 --> 15:52.333
Jack, Jack. We heard what happened.

15:52.417 --> 15:53.834
You're going to be okay.

15:54.375 --> 15:55.250
<i>Yeah.</i>

15:55.333 --> 15:57.041
I bumped my head once and I was fine.

15:57.125 --> 16:00.583
Of course when I woke up I was in Mexico
married to a ferret farmer.

16:02.500 --> 16:04.000
As an action hero,

16:04.083 --> 16:05.625
I've been in hundreds of movies

16:05.709 --> 16:07.834
where I've been kicked
in the head countless times.

16:07.917 --> 16:10.709
And I can say with complete authority...

16:11.834 --> 16:13.709
I'm sorry, what was the question?

16:15.166 --> 16:17.291
Please tell me these aren't my parents.

16:17.417 --> 16:19.291
Nah, just good friends.

16:19.417 --> 16:20.625
Who do you think you are?

16:26.542 --> 16:27.750
I am...

16:29.041 --> 16:31.750
Bobby Wasabi.

16:36.166 --> 16:38.458
What's up, fresh meat?

16:38.542 --> 16:40.458
I'm Norma.

16:45.250 --> 16:47.583
Ow. Ow. Stop poking me.

16:47.667 --> 16:50.583
You can't act when you're asleep.

16:50.667 --> 16:52.458
You can't act when you're awake!

16:53.959 --> 16:55.959
Yo, check it.

17:03.750 --> 17:05.792
What it do, girl?

17:05.875 --> 17:08.291
Wow! Very nice form.

17:08.375 --> 17:10.208
You're a fast learner.

17:10.291 --> 17:11.417
You feel the burn?

17:11.500 --> 17:12.417
Whoo-wee!

17:12.500 --> 17:14.500
I feel it!

17:14.583 --> 17:15.500
Hey!

17:15.583 --> 17:18.917
Look, my butt's looking better already.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
Karate-la-tes!

17:21.083 --> 17:22.458
I'm in!

17:22.542 --> 17:23.917
Have these delinquents

17:24.000 --> 17:25.583
clear their stuff out of the dojo.

17:27.583 --> 17:29.709
And while this hurts me,

17:29.792 --> 17:31.250
because, whoa!

17:31.291 --> 17:34.208
I am going to miss you.

17:34.625 --> 17:38.709
If you ever set foot on these premises,

17:38.792 --> 17:41.709
I will handcuff you to a water pipe

17:41.792 --> 17:43.709
and use my nightstick to--

17:43.792 --> 17:45.083
I think they get it, Joan.

17:47.417 --> 17:48.375
Bobby, welcome!

17:48.458 --> 17:49.959
I'm sorry, I...

17:50.041 --> 17:52.750
was hoping to slip in unnoticed.

17:54.750 --> 17:56.667
There he is. That's Jack.

17:56.750 --> 17:58.458
Guys, this is Winston Burgess

17:58.542 --> 18:00.458
from the burgess book of world records.

18:00.542 --> 18:02.667
If we could just have a little more time.

18:02.750 --> 18:04.041
I don't have a lot of time.

18:04.125 --> 18:07.208
I gotta go watch a woman
not blink for 27 hours.

18:08.792 --> 18:09.750
I don't think I can do this,

18:09.834 --> 18:11.458
but I don't wanna let you guys down.

18:12.125 --> 18:13.375
I'm sorry, Katherine.

18:14.458 --> 18:16.041
Again, it's Kim.

18:17.959 --> 18:19.709
I don't care about this record.

18:20.458 --> 18:21.834
I just want Jack back.

18:23.750 --> 18:24.834
You know what?

18:25.959 --> 18:27.667
I don't remember you guys or this place,

18:27.750 --> 18:30.083
but from everything you've said,

18:30.583 --> 18:31.792
we don't give up.

18:32.583 --> 18:34.000
And I don't wanna start now.

18:34.583 --> 18:36.000
I'm a Wabooboo warrior!

18:36.709 --> 18:38.291
Wasabi warrior.

18:39.041 --> 18:40.792
Right. It's got a better ring to it.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.291
Use this.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
- <i>Jack...</i>
Wasabi!

19:09.083 --> 19:10.083
Yeah!

19:21.917 --> 19:24.542
- Yeah!
- Yes, you did it!

19:24.625 --> 19:25.625
Yeah!

19:25.709 --> 19:27.625
I can't believe it. My memory's back.

19:27.750 --> 19:29.709
I remember you and the dojo

19:29.792 --> 19:31.333
and Milton and Rudy

19:31.375 --> 19:32.375
and Jerry.

19:32.417 --> 19:34.041
You owe me 20 bucks.

19:35.917 --> 19:37.083
I'm Eddie.

19:37.166 --> 19:38.458
What?

19:38.542 --> 19:39.834
Congratulations, Jack.

19:39.917 --> 19:42.625
You'll now be listed
as the official under-15

19:42.709 --> 19:45.250
world record holder for brick-breaking.

19:47.417 --> 19:49.250
Let's go to falafel Phil's and celebrate.

19:49.333 --> 19:51.041
Falafel Phil's?

19:51.125 --> 19:52.625
I believe that's the restaurant

19:52.709 --> 19:56.500
that holds the world record
for largest roach infestation.

19:56.583 --> 19:57.875
That's the place.

20:00.333 --> 20:01.667
Jack, you did it.

20:01.750 --> 20:02.667
How do you feel?

20:02.750 --> 20:03.875
I feel great.

20:03.959 --> 20:05.375
Jack is back!

20:05.458 --> 20:06.667
We missed you.

20:07.542 --> 20:09.917
Hey, I've got one question.

20:10.041 --> 20:13.166
Do you remember anything that I had said
right before you fell and hit your head?

20:14.500 --> 20:15.792
No. No, I don't.

20:15.875 --> 20:16.792
Why?

20:16.875 --> 20:18.375
No reason.

20:18.458 --> 20:19.792
I'll see you over at Phil's.

20:19.875 --> 20:20.875
Okay.

20:29.166 --> 20:30.291
<i>♪ Hey ♪</i>

20:30.375 --> 20:31.500
<i>♪ Come on ♪</i>

20:31.583 --> 20:32.875
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you! ♪</i>

20:34.000 --> 20:37.417
Well, I was hoping we could have a day of
cultural enlightenment.

20:37.917 --> 20:38.917
Hey, lady!

20:39.000 --> 20:41.333
How do we get to
the dog toy museum hall of...

20:41.417 --> 20:42.417
What?

20:44.458 --> 20:46.709
When we sparred this morning,
did you let me win?

20:46.792 --> 20:47.792
What?

20:49.333 --> 20:50.959
What?

20:51.834 --> 20:53.375
What? What?

20:53.500 --> 20:54.500
What?

20:57.583 --> 20:59.083
Out of my way, folks!

20:59.166 --> 21:00.500
Lunch ladies first!

21:06.583 --> 21:08.417
We lost the principal's baby!

21:08.500 --> 21:10.125
It's not like losing... Huh?

21:10.208 --> 21:11.917
- I found it!
- You did? Nice.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.875
It's not like losing some
English teacher's baby, man!

21:13.959 --> 21:14.834
This is big time!

21:14.917 --> 21:16.667
We're doing the best we can.

21:22.250 --> 21:23.875
Yeah, that'd be great if your job was

21:23.959 --> 21:25.375
to not sell candy bars!
