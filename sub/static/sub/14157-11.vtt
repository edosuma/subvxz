28:34.446 --> 28:35.347
* WHAT YOU LOOKING AT

28:35.347 --> 28:36.382
* I SEE WHAT YOU LIKE

28:36.382 --> 28:37.349
* WHAT YOU LOOKING AT

28:37.349 --> 28:38.217

28:38.217 --> 28:39.285
* WHAT YOU LOOKING AT

28:39.285 --> 28:41.053
* I SEE WHAT YOU LIKE

28:41.053 --> 28:41.988
* I SEE WHAT YOU LIKE

28:41.988 --> 28:42.889

28:49.295 --> 28:50.296
* WHAT YOU LOOKING AT

28:50.296 --> 28:51.163
* I SEE WHAT YOU LIKE

28:51.163 --> 28:52.298

28:54.366 --> 28:56.002

28:56.002 --> 28:57.003
[singing indistinctly]

28:57.003 --> 29:05.044
*

29:11.217 --> 29:12.218
[rapping indistinctly]

29:12.218 --> 29:20.359
*

29:27.133 --> 29:29.201
>> [snaps fingers]

29:31.070 --> 29:32.038
>> [laughs]

29:32.038 --> 29:33.039
>> GIRL, YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN HIS

29:33.039 --> 29:33.873
FACE.

29:33.873 --> 29:34.941
HE COULD NOT BELIEVE IT.

29:34.941 --> 29:36.242
>> I COULD NOT BELIEVE I MISSED

29:36.242 --> 29:37.076
IT.

29:37.076 --> 29:38.077
>> NO ONE PUTS BABY IN THE

29:38.077 --> 29:38.911
CORNER.

29:38.911 --> 29:40.779
>> NO ONE.

29:40.779 --> 29:45.084
>> HEY, RAQUEL, WHERE YOU GOING?

29:45.084 --> 29:48.720
>> I'M CALLING IT A NIGHT.

29:48.720 --> 29:49.755
>> OKAY, YOU'RE JUST GONNA LEAVE

29:49.755 --> 29:51.757
WITHOUT SAYING GOOD-BYE?

29:51.757 --> 29:55.594
>> GUYS, GIVE ME A SECOND?

29:55.594 --> 29:56.562
YOU DIDN'T SAY GOOD-BYE THIS

29:56.562 --> 29:57.396
MORNING.

29:57.396 --> 29:58.464
>> THAT'S BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT

29:58.464 --> 29:59.398
TO WAKE YOU.

29:59.398 --> 30:00.366
>> YEAH, WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU

30:00.366 --> 30:01.968
LEAVE A NOTE?

30:01.968 --> 30:04.503
>> OKAY, LOOK, I'M SORRY, ALL

30:04.503 --> 30:06.672
RIGHT?

30:06.672 --> 30:07.573
SO WHAT'S UP?

30:07.573 --> 30:09.208
AM I GONNA SEE YOU LATER?

30:09.208 --> 30:10.676
>> TONIGHT?

30:10.676 --> 30:11.510
>> YEAH.

30:11.510 --> 30:12.378
>> OH, NO, HONEY.

30:12.378 --> 30:13.445
I AM NOT A BOOTY CALL.

30:13.445 --> 30:14.346
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

30:14.346 --> 30:15.414
YOU CAN TRY ERIKA, BECAUSE SHE

30:15.414 --> 30:17.116
DOESN'T SEEM TO MIND.

30:17.116 --> 30:18.284
>> COME ON, YOU KNOW ERIKA AND I

30:18.284 --> 30:19.118
ARE JUST FRIENDS.

30:19.118 --> 30:20.619
>> YEAH, WITH BENEFITS.

30:20.619 --> 30:22.721
>> RAQUEL, COME ON.

30:22.721 --> 30:24.356
>> NOT ONE OF YOUR FRIENDS KNEW

30:24.356 --> 30:25.892
WHO I WAS, 'CAUSE YOU'VE NEVER

30:25.892 --> 30:27.559
EVEN EVER MENTIONED ME.

30:27.559 --> 30:28.460
>> WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU?

30:28.460 --> 30:30.396
>> WHAT IS GOING ON WITH US?

30:30.396 --> 30:31.763
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

30:31.763 --> 30:35.767
>> TERRENCE, WHAT ARE WE?

30:38.004 --> 30:38.905
>> COME ON, WHAT DO YOU WANT ME

30:38.905 --> 30:39.738
TO SAY, HUH?

30:39.738 --> 30:40.739
IF I SAY THE WRONG THING, YOU'LL

30:40.739 --> 30:41.573
FREAK OUT.

30:41.573 --> 30:42.408
>> OH, OKAY.

30:42.408 --> 30:43.242
THAT'S HOW YOU FEEL?

30:43.242 --> 30:44.076
FINE.

30:44.076 --> 30:45.044
DO WHAT YOU ALWAYS DO.

30:45.044 --> 30:46.445
DON'T SAY ANYTHING.

30:46.445 --> 30:49.448
CAN WE GO, PLEASE?

30:56.155 --> 30:57.656
>> LET'S JUST FACE IT.

30:57.656 --> 30:59.158
WOMEN WANT TO LOOK LIKE YOU,

30:59.158 --> 31:01.460
EVEN IF THAT MEANS BUYING

31:01.460 --> 31:02.995
TWO-BIT KNOCKOFFS OF MY DESIGNS

31:02.995 --> 31:04.063
ONLINE.

31:04.063 --> 31:05.197
SO WHY SHOULD WE SIT BACK AND

31:05.197 --> 31:06.532
LET SOMEBODY ELSE GET RICH OFF

31:06.532 --> 31:08.134
OF YOUR REMARKABLE CHARISMA

31:08.134 --> 31:09.868
AND MY INSANE TALENT?

31:09.868 --> 31:11.670
>> HMM, BUT THE FASHION INDUSTRY

31:11.670 --> 31:13.205
CAN BE FICKLE.

31:13.205 --> 31:15.774
>> YES, BUT A LINE DESIGNED BY

31:15.774 --> 31:18.644
ME, INSPIRED BY YOU...IT'D BE

31:18.644 --> 31:20.479
LIKE PRINTING MONEY.

31:20.479 --> 31:22.514
>> LOOK, I APPRECIATE YOUR

31:22.514 --> 31:25.351
CONFIDENCE IN US, BUT I'D HAVE

31:25.351 --> 31:26.185
TO THINK ABOUT IT.

31:26.185 --> 31:28.154
THAT'S A BIG UNDERTAKING, AND AN

31:28.154 --> 31:32.491
EVEN BIGGER RISK.

31:32.491 --> 31:34.293
OOH, BUT YES TO THE SHOES.

31:34.293 --> 31:37.964
>> YES TO THE SHOES.

31:37.964 --> 31:39.131
>> * IF YOU LOVE ME, BABY

31:39.131 --> 31:41.233
* SAY YEAH

31:41.233 --> 31:42.301
* IF YOU LOVE ME, BABY

31:42.301 --> 31:44.470
* SAY YEAH

31:44.470 --> 31:45.337
* IF YOU LOVE ME, BABY

31:45.337 --> 31:46.472
>> OH, HEY, BABY, DON'T FORGET

31:46.472 --> 31:48.107
THAT WE HAVE RESERVATIONS, SO

31:48.107 --> 31:48.975
YOU WANT TO JUST MEET ME AT MY

31:48.975 --> 31:50.476
OFFICE, SAY AROUND 7:30?

31:50.476 --> 31:51.310
>> SEE YOU THEN.

31:51.310 --> 31:53.980
>> ALL RIGHT.

31:53.980 --> 31:55.214
>> * BUT ONLY ME AND YOU

31:55.214 --> 31:57.449
* CAN KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS

31:57.449 --> 31:58.617
* 'CAUSE YOU SEE ALL MY FLAWS *

31:58.617 --> 32:00.886
* AND YOU DON'T MIND *

32:00.886 --> 32:01.920
* TILL I'M UP *

32:01.920 --> 32:03.956
* TRY TO CROSS THE LINE

32:03.956 --> 32:07.626
* BUT IT'S OKAY *

32:07.626 --> 32:09.095
>> HEY.

32:09.095 --> 32:10.229
LISTEN, I HATE KEEPING IT FROM

32:10.229 --> 32:13.365
KEISHA, BUT IT HAS TO BE DONE.

32:13.365 --> 32:14.200
YEAH, I'M SURE.

32:14.200 --> 32:15.401
I'VE BEEN EXTREMELY CAREFUL.

32:15.401 --> 32:16.335
NOW, LISTEN, I APPRECIATE YOUR

32:16.335 --> 32:18.004
COOPERATION WITH ALL THIS,

32:18.004 --> 32:19.105
BECAUSE I KNOW I HAVE BENT THE

32:19.105 --> 32:20.572
RULES MORE THAN A LITTLE BIT,

32:20.572 --> 32:22.274
BUT, I MEAN, YOU KNOW, A MAN'S

32:22.274 --> 32:23.275
GOTTA DO WHAT A MAN'S GOTTA DO,

32:23.275 --> 32:24.176
RIGHT?

32:24.176 --> 32:26.445
[laughs]

32:26.445 --> 32:29.548
YEAH, OKAY.

32:29.548 --> 32:32.018
WELL, LET'S MAKE IT HAPPEN.

32:32.018 --> 32:33.452
SEE YOU SOON.

32:33.452 --> 32:38.424
YEAH, BYE.

32:45.731 --> 32:47.866
>> FELICIA, BEFORE WE DISCUSS

32:47.866 --> 32:50.569
WHAT I CAME HERE TO, UM, I NEED

32:50.569 --> 32:51.903
TO CONFESS SOMETHING.

32:51.903 --> 32:53.039
>> UNLESS THIS HAS TO DO WITH

32:53.039 --> 32:54.906
BUSINESS, I'M SURE I'D RATHER

32:54.906 --> 32:56.275
NOT KNOW.

32:56.275 --> 32:57.843
>> UNFORTUNATELY, IT DOES HAVE

32:57.843 --> 33:01.080
TO DO WITH BUSINESS.

33:01.080 --> 33:02.981
I'VE BEEN SLEEPING WITH DAVID.

33:02.981 --> 33:03.815
>> YOU THINK THAT WAS A BIG

33:03.815 --> 33:04.650
SECRET?

33:04.650 --> 33:08.020
BECAUSE IT WASN'T.

33:08.020 --> 33:09.355
>> OH.

33:09.355 --> 33:10.589
WELL, THIS MIGHT BE.

33:10.589 --> 33:11.923
DAVID IS PLANNING TO LEAVE PRICE

33:11.923 --> 33:13.092
MANAGEMENT, AND HE'S GONNA TRY

33:13.092 --> 33:13.959
TO TAKE HALF YOUR CLIENTS WITH

33:13.959 --> 33:14.793
HIM.

33:14.793 --> 33:15.627
>> WHAT?

33:15.627 --> 33:16.595
>> THAT'S THE CONTRACT THAT HE

33:16.595 --> 33:19.498
GAVE TO LANNIE T.

33:19.498 --> 33:20.432
>> WHY RAT HIM OUT IF YOU'RE

33:20.432 --> 33:21.433
SLEEPING WITH HIM?

33:21.433 --> 33:22.301
>> BECAUSE IT'S ONE THING TO

33:22.301 --> 33:23.402
SLEEP WITH SOMEONE THAT WORKS IN

33:23.402 --> 33:24.403
YOUR COMPANY, AND IT'S ANOTHER

33:24.403 --> 33:25.837
THING TO WATCH THEM DEMOLISH IT.

33:25.837 --> 33:26.972
>> ADMIRABLE.

33:26.972 --> 33:27.806
>> WHAT?

33:27.806 --> 33:29.775
NO, FELICIA, YOU'RE ADMIRABLE.

33:29.775 --> 33:30.942
YOU'VE WORKED SO HARD TO BUILD

33:30.942 --> 33:33.412
THIS PLACE, AND YES, I DIDN'T

33:33.412 --> 33:35.314
LIKE YOU AT FIRST, BUT I DO NOW.

33:35.314 --> 33:36.282
I LIKE YOU.

33:36.282 --> 33:37.983
I LIKE MY JOB, AND WHAT I DON'T

33:37.983 --> 33:39.118
LIKE IS WHEN SOMEONE THREATENS

33:39.118 --> 33:42.488
IT.

33:44.656 --> 33:47.659
>> THANK YOU.

33:50.829 --> 33:51.997
OKAY, EITHER YOU HAVEN'T HAD

33:51.997 --> 33:52.998
YOUR COFFEE YET OR YOU'RE UPSET

33:52.998 --> 33:53.832
ABOUT SOMETHING.

33:53.832 --> 33:55.134
>> I HAVE ALREADY HAD MY COFFEE.

33:55.134 --> 33:55.967
>> UH-OH.

33:55.967 --> 33:56.768
>> MM-HMM.

33:56.768 --> 33:58.237
I JUST OVERHEARD MALCOLM ON THE

33:58.237 --> 34:00.372
PHONE, TELLING SOMEONE, "DON'T

34:00.372 --> 34:01.740
LET KEISHA KNOW."

34:01.740 --> 34:02.574
MM-HMM.

34:02.574 --> 34:04.042
THE MAN'S OBVIOUSLY GOT SOME NEW

34:04.042 --> 34:05.511
SHADY DEAL HE'S WORKING.

34:05.511 --> 34:07.213
HE PROMISED THAT HE WOULD NOT

34:07.213 --> 34:08.714
KEEP THINGS FROM ME ANYMORE, AND

34:08.714 --> 34:09.715
THAT PROMISE DIDN'T EVEN LAST A

34:09.715 --> 34:10.549
WEEK.

34:10.549 --> 34:12.384
>> DAMN, GIRL, I AM SO SORRY.

34:12.384 --> 34:14.486
>> YEAH, ME TOO, BECAUSE HE MAY

34:14.486 --> 34:15.487
BE OKAY WITH BREAKING HIS

34:15.487 --> 34:16.888
PROMISES, BUT I'M NOT OKAY WITH

34:16.888 --> 34:18.490
BREAKING MINE, AND I MADE A

34:18.490 --> 34:20.492
PROMISE THAT IF HE KEPT ONE MORE

34:20.492 --> 34:22.694
THING FROM ME, I'D BE GONE.

34:22.694 --> 34:23.762
>> OKAY, SO WHAT DID YOU SAY?

34:23.762 --> 34:25.497
>> NOTHING YET.

34:25.497 --> 34:26.498
I WAS SO ANGRY, I COULDN'T EVEN

34:26.498 --> 34:28.066
THINK STRAIGHT.

34:28.066 --> 34:29.368
HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW I OVERHEARD

34:29.368 --> 34:31.137
HIM.

34:31.137 --> 34:33.572
OKAY, I'M GONNA TAKE THIS DAY.

34:33.572 --> 34:35.006
I'M GONNA TRY TO CALM DOWN.

34:35.006 --> 34:36.675
YEP.

34:36.675 --> 34:38.910
YEP, AND THEN WHEN I MEET HIM

34:38.910 --> 34:40.412
FOR DINNER TONIGHT, I'M GONNA

34:40.412 --> 34:42.047
LET HIM HAVE IT.

34:42.047 --> 34:44.516
>> OKAY, WELL, AT LEAST YOU HAVE

34:44.516 --> 34:45.351
A PLAN.

34:45.351 --> 34:46.852
>> YEP, AND AFTER I'M DONE WITH

34:46.852 --> 34:48.086
THIS ONE, I'M GONNA TAKE UP YOUR

34:48.086 --> 34:49.555
OLD ONE, MEANING I'M DONE WITH

34:49.555 --> 34:51.190
MEN FOR A WHILE.

34:51.190 --> 34:52.491
I'M FOCUSING ON ME.

34:52.491 --> 34:55.026
>> YEAH, WELL, THAT MAKES TWO OF

34:55.026 --> 34:55.861
US.

34:55.861 --> 34:56.762
>> WHAT HAPPENED WITH TERRENCE?

34:56.762 --> 34:57.596
>> NOTHING.

34:57.596 --> 34:58.530
NOTHING HAPPENED WITH TERRENCE.

34:58.530 --> 35:00.065
TERRENCE IS TERRENCE, GIRL.

35:00.065 --> 35:01.467
I JUST WOKE UP AND REALIZED

35:01.467 --> 35:02.468
THAT HE ISN'T RELATIONSHIP

35:02.468 --> 35:03.802
MATERIAL, AND I SHOULD'VE NEVER,

35:03.802 --> 35:07.139
EVER WENT THERE, AND I DID, AND

35:07.139 --> 35:07.973
YOU KNOW WHAT?

35:07.973 --> 35:10.442
I'M READY TO GET BACK ON TRACK.

35:10.442 --> 35:13.111
I'VE DONE NOTHING BUT CHOOSE THE

35:13.111 --> 35:15.481
WRONG GUYS OVER AND OVER AGAIN,

35:15.481 --> 35:17.082
SO FROM NOW ON, I'M JUST GONNA

35:17.082 --> 35:17.916
CHOOSE ME.

35:17.916 --> 35:21.787
>> I LIKE THE SOUND OF THAT.

35:21.787 --> 35:25.757
OH, COME HERE.

35:25.757 --> 35:28.227
>> DAMN.

35:28.227 --> 35:29.295
>> WELL, AT LEAST WE GOT EACH

35:29.295 --> 35:33.098
OTHER, AND WE'LL GET THROUGH IT,

35:33.098 --> 35:33.932
HMM?

35:33.932 --> 35:36.302
>> both: YES.

35:38.537 --> 35:39.405
>> [laughs]

35:39.405 --> 35:40.306
HEY, LADIES, Y'ALL LIKE MY

35:40.306 --> 35:41.139
JACKET?

35:41.139 --> 35:42.241
I GOT IT--

35:42.241 --> 35:43.542
UH, I--

35:43.542 --> 35:45.977
LOOK, I CAN EXPLAIN THAT.

35:45.977 --> 35:47.313
>> OH, YOU SAY THAT LIKE I'M

35:47.313 --> 35:49.080
ASKING YOU TO.

35:49.080 --> 35:50.115
>> YOU TOLD ME YOU WEREN'T GONNA

35:50.115 --> 35:51.149
DO THIS, DAVID.

35:51.149 --> 35:52.284
I SWEAR TO GOD, YOU'VE LIED TO

35:52.284 --> 35:53.552
ME FOR THE LAST TIME.

35:53.552 --> 35:54.420
>> LOOK, I WAS GONNA TAKE YOU

35:54.420 --> 35:55.254
WITH ME.

35:55.254 --> 35:56.288
>> WHY WOULD I COME WITH YOU?

35:56.288 --> 35:57.589
YOU'RE CONSTANTLY LYING.

35:57.589 --> 35:59.225
YOU'RE ALWAYS OUT FOR YOURSELF.

35:59.225 --> 36:00.292
SHE MAY BE TOUGH, BUT SHE'S

36:00.292 --> 36:01.793
FAIR, AND GUESS WHAT, DAVID?

36:01.793 --> 36:03.028
SHE DOESN'T LIE.

36:03.028 --> 36:05.331
>> BUT THIS IS BUSINESS, APRIL.

36:05.331 --> 36:06.332
TRUST ME WHEN I TELL YOU,

36:06.332 --> 36:07.799
FELICIA'S OUT FOR HERSELF.

36:07.799 --> 36:08.734
>> WELL, AT LEAST SHE WASN'T

36:08.734 --> 36:09.701
SLEEPING WITH ME AND PRETENDING

36:09.701 --> 36:10.836
SHE WANTED A RELATIONSHIP.

36:10.836 --> 36:12.204
>> YEAH, WELL, MAYBE I DID, BUT

36:12.204 --> 36:13.272
YOU'LL NEVER KNOW NOW.

36:13.272 --> 36:14.273
>> YOU'RE NOT CAPABLE OF HAVING

36:14.273 --> 36:15.106
A RELATIONSHIP.

36:15.106 --> 36:16.107
A RELATIONSHIP TAKES A HEART,

36:16.107 --> 36:16.942
AND GUESS WHAT?

36:16.942 --> 36:18.377
YOU DON'T HAVE ONE.

36:18.377 --> 36:19.645
IT SCARES ME TO THINK I DIDN'T

36:19.645 --> 36:20.479
REALIZE IT SOONER.

36:20.479 --> 36:21.313
YOU KNOW WHAT?

36:21.313 --> 36:22.281
IT'S FINE, BECAUSE I KNOW WHO

36:22.281 --> 36:23.114
YOU ARE NOW.

36:23.114 --> 36:23.949
>> ENOUGH, ENOUGH!

36:23.949 --> 36:25.016
GOSH, WE'RE DONE HERE.

36:25.016 --> 36:27.219
LISTEN, DAVID, YOU MIGHT WANT TO

36:27.219 --> 36:28.887
RE-READ YOUR CONTRACT BEFORE YOU

36:28.887 --> 36:30.456
GO OFF STEALING CLIENTS.

36:30.456 --> 36:31.523
YOU SEE, THERE'S A LITTLE THING

36:31.523 --> 36:32.391
CALLED A TWO-YEAR

36:32.391 --> 36:33.392
NON-COMPETITIVE CLAUSE.

36:33.392 --> 36:34.326
DO YOU NEED ME TO EXPLAIN IT TO

36:34.326 --> 36:35.160
YOU?

36:35.160 --> 36:35.994
>> WAIT, WAIT, WHAT?

36:35.994 --> 36:36.895
>> BETTER YET, YOU MIGHT WANT TO

36:36.895 --> 36:37.863
HAVE YOUR LAWYER EXPLAIN IT TO

36:37.863 --> 36:38.697
YOU.

36:38.697 --> 36:39.965
THERE'S A COPY OF YOUR CONTRACT

36:39.965 --> 36:43.769
IN WITH THE REST OF YOUR CRAP.

36:44.770 --> 36:46.805
>> OH, AND HEY, DAVID, I'LL TAKE

36:46.805 --> 36:48.039
GOOD CARE OF YOUR CLIENTS,

36:48.039 --> 36:49.441
SEEING AS FELICIA GAVE THEM ALL

36:49.441 --> 36:52.278
TO ME.

36:52.278 --> 36:53.379
>> HELLO!

36:53.379 --> 36:56.615
GET BACK TO WORK.

37:18.670 --> 37:21.773
>> SURPRISE.

37:21.773 --> 37:22.674
>> [laughs]

37:22.674 --> 37:27.546
WHAT...

37:27.546 --> 37:30.549
WHAT IS ALL THIS?

37:34.453 --> 37:36.355
>> BABY, WE'VE BEEN THROUGH SO

37:36.355 --> 37:40.692
MUCH, AND, UH...

37:40.692 --> 37:43.862
AND I'VE MADE SO MANY MISTAKES.

37:43.862 --> 37:45.230
BUT MOST OF THOSE MISTAKES WERE

37:45.230 --> 37:47.699
MADE IN THE PAST, WHEN I DIDN'T

37:47.699 --> 37:49.067
HAVE YOU BY MY SIDE.

37:49.067 --> 37:50.602
>> UH-HUH.

37:50.602 --> 37:54.205
>> SO TONIGHT...

37:54.205 --> 37:55.240
TONIGHT, I'M ASKING YOU TO

37:55.240 --> 37:59.378
STAND BY MY SIDE FOR THE REST

37:59.378 --> 38:01.112
OF OUR LIVES.

38:01.112 --> 38:04.115
AND I WOULDN'T EVEN DREAM OF

38:04.115 --> 38:05.751
DOING THAT UNLESS I WAS READY

38:05.751 --> 38:07.819
TO PUT A RING ON IT.

38:07.819 --> 38:10.956
IT WAS QUITE A PRODUCTION.

38:10.956 --> 38:13.325
YOU SEE, I'VE HAD RINGS FROM

38:13.325 --> 38:15.427
EVERY SINGLE FRANKS JEWELS IN

38:15.427 --> 38:21.032
THE WORLD SENT HERE FOR THE LOVE

38:21.032 --> 38:25.504
OF MY LIFE.

38:25.504 --> 38:27.673
>> THAT'S WHAT YOU WERE DOING.

38:27.673 --> 38:29.274
>> WHAT?

38:29.274 --> 38:31.610
>> NOTHING.

38:31.610 --> 38:36.415
>> TAKE A LOOK AROUND.

38:36.415 --> 38:40.151
>> [stammers, laughs]

38:40.151 --> 38:41.119
>> AND IF THERE'S NOT ONE HERE

38:41.119 --> 38:44.022
THAT YOU LIKE, THEN WE'LL JUST

38:44.022 --> 38:48.026
HAVE IT MADE FOR YOU.

38:53.599 --> 38:54.733
KEISHA GREEN...

38:54.733 --> 38:55.767
>> * BABY

38:55.767 --> 38:57.669
* YOU KNOW THAT YOU GOT ME

38:57.669 --> 38:58.504

39:01.072 --> 39:04.342

YES, YES I'LL MARRY YOU.

39:08.079 --> 39:09.648
[both laughing]

39:09.648 --> 39:11.216

39:11.216 --> 39:12.718
*YOU KNOW THAT YOU GOT ME *

39:12.718 --> 39:14.886

39:14.886 --> 39:18.156
[both laughing]

39:18.156 --> 39:20.726

39:20.726 --> 39:23.161
*

39:23.161 --> 39:25.096
>> * YOU KNOW THAT...

39:25.096 --> 39:29.801

39:32.303 --> 39:33.138
>> ON THE SEASON FINALE OF

39:33.138 --> 39:33.972
SINGLE LADIES...

39:33.972 --> 39:34.906
>> MY E-MAIL HAS BEEN BLOWING UP

39:34.906 --> 39:36.241
WITH RSVPs FOR THE ENGAGEMENT

39:36.241 --> 39:37.075
PARTY.

39:37.075 --> 39:38.810
>> HERE'S TO GETTING YOUR OWN ON

39:38.810 --> 39:39.678
YOUR OWN TERMS.

39:39.678 --> 39:40.512
>> YES!

39:40.512 --> 39:41.346
>> YES!

39:41.346 --> 39:42.481
>> LUKE HAS ALL THESE JUDGES IN

39:42.481 --> 39:43.815
HIS BACK POCKET, AND I MIGHT

39:43.815 --> 39:44.916
NEED THOSE JUDGES IF THIS

39:44.916 --> 39:46.552
INDICTMENT COMES DOWN, MAN.

39:46.552 --> 39:48.186
>> DAVID IS GOING AFTER SERGIO.

39:48.186 --> 39:49.220
YOU'RE GETTING ON A PLANE RIGHT

39:49.220 --> 39:50.355
NOW TO MAKE SURE THAT HE

39:50.355 --> 39:51.523
DOESN'T.

39:51.523 --> 39:52.357
>> [laughs]

39:52.357 --> 39:53.492
>> SO I WAS THINKING THAT WE

39:53.492 --> 39:55.494
SHOULD RUN THE BUSINESS BY PHONE

39:55.494 --> 39:56.361
CALLS AND E-MAIL FOR A LITTLE

39:56.361 --> 39:58.263
WHILE.

39:58.263 --> 40:00.398
>> I HAD TO SEE THIS FOR MYSELF.

40:00.398 --> 40:02.501
>> I REALLY MESSED UP THIS TIME.

40:02.501 --> 40:03.969
>> KEISHA!

40:03.969 --> 40:05.303
KEISHA, STOP!

40:05.303 --> 40:06.204

BROTHER DID TO DEACON.
