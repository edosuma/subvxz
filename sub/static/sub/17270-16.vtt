- He trusts me.

10:14.639 --> 10:16.273

about you missing your boyfriend?

10:21.335 --> 10:23.162

13:21.109 --> 13:23.210
And I can be...

13:25.353 --> 13:27.814
The Scarlett Pimp. (CHUCKLES)

13:28.216 --> 13:29.416
Well, then...

13:29.851 --> 13:30.984
Come here, pimp.

13:30.986 --> 13:33.386
Mmm. (GIGGLES)

13:36.691 --> 13:38.811
<i>TIM: Um, excuse me.</i>

13:39.492 --> 13:40.906
<i>Sorry to disturb you.</i>

13:41.382 --> 13:42.946
Will you wake up already?

13:43.009 --> 13:44.265
<i>I'm not a bloody alarm clock.</i>

13:44.266 --> 13:45.461
What is it, Tim?

13:45.524 --> 13:49.102
<i>Your so-called Red Avenger just
snuck into Rockefeller Gardens</i>

13:49.104 --> 13:50.770
<i>to pilfer a few roses.</i>

13:50.772 --> 13:52.005
Is she still there?

13:52.007 --> 13:54.555
<i>Unfortunately, no. But
I was able to follow her</i>

13:54.580 --> 13:56.307
<i>to a bar in Little Saigon.</i>

13:59.313 --> 14:01.314
(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

14:02.182 --> 14:03.516
You been here before?

14:04.271 --> 14:07.831
Two thousand miles
between Korea and Vietnam.

14:07.887 --> 14:10.396
I just mean you look like
you know your way around.

14:17.897 --> 14:19.787
You getting any paranormal vibes?

14:21.251 --> 14:22.433
She's under us.

14:33.847 --> 14:35.281
(YELLING)

14:38.619 --> 14:40.119
(GRUNTING)

14:55.202 --> 14:56.972
- We're not here to fight you.
- (GRUNTS)

14:57.791 --> 14:59.725
RUSSELL: Hey! Hey! It's me!

15:00.219 --> 15:01.789
It's me! Talia!

15:03.416 --> 15:04.343
Seriously.

15:06.213 --> 15:07.594
What's wrong with you?

15:07.714 --> 15:09.115
It's me.

15:10.717 --> 15:12.118
You're not Talia.

15:12.686 --> 15:13.662
Duh.

15:13.975 --> 15:15.351
The name's Mallory.

15:15.357 --> 15:17.016
Who are you clowns anyway?

15:17.679 --> 15:19.374
And how do you know Talia?

15:26.628 --> 15:28.436
You're Russell Kwon?

15:28.987 --> 15:31.388
Uh... that's what it says on my underwear.

15:31.392 --> 15:32.659
Wow.

15:32.779 --> 15:34.942
Feel like I should ask for
an autograph or something.

15:35.062 --> 15:36.963
I thought you two didn't know each other.

15:37.083 --> 15:39.535
Well I know of him. We all know of him.

15:39.553 --> 15:42.112
He inspired the first
in our line of Avengers.

15:42.470 --> 15:44.233
Although in my mind you were taller.

15:44.265 --> 15:48.307
Wait, so there's more than
one Red Avenger person?

15:48.325 --> 15:49.608
And you started this?

15:49.639 --> 15:52.223
I have no idea what she's
talking about. Where's Talia?

15:52.480 --> 15:54.056
Don't you get it? She's everywhere.

15:54.257 --> 15:57.173
The Avenger's a mantle. It's
passed down from person to person,

15:57.204 --> 15:58.799
from city to city.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.501
Talia's still out there.

16:00.538 --> 16:02.036
Doing what you taught her to do.

16:02.478 --> 16:04.855
And what she taught me,
and some day if I'm lucky,

16:04.862 --> 16:06.657
I'll pass it on to somebody else.

16:06.858 --> 16:10.324
As much as I love to take
credit for other people's work...

16:10.349 --> 16:11.387
You're humble.

16:11.663 --> 16:13.546
I like that. It's really classy, man.

16:14.103 --> 16:15.217
Look...

16:15.924 --> 16:19.239
I respect you playing dress-up
and beating on baddies,

16:19.253 --> 16:21.892
but you have no idea what
we're up against in this town.

16:22.173 --> 16:25.739
We're being hunted by a secret
government organization called Ultra.

16:25.771 --> 16:29.105
We have this bunker where
people like us are safe.

16:29.225 --> 16:30.938
You're welcome to join us, Mallory.

16:31.132 --> 16:33.828
Oh, that's cute. All right,
you guys can crawl back down

16:33.847 --> 16:36.506
into your bunker, but I
don't play in a world of safe.

16:36.894 --> 16:38.014
Neither does Talia.

16:38.439 --> 16:41.497
Well, good talk, but I gotta go
finish that mission that y'all pooched.

16:41.743 --> 16:42.932
What mission?

16:44.167 --> 16:46.699
If you're so curious, why don't
you join me for a ride along?

16:46.749 --> 16:50.503
(LAUGHS) Uh, you want us to play superhero?

16:50.520 --> 16:51.548
It's not a game.

16:58.562 --> 16:59.929
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

16:59.931 --> 17:01.297
(DOOR OPENING)

17:09.080 --> 17:10.114
You came.

17:10.383 --> 17:11.815
Yeah, I did.

17:12.241 --> 17:14.977
Against my better judgment. What
are you doing above ground, Morgan?

17:15.469 --> 17:17.279
Well I needed a proper bath.

17:18.647 --> 17:21.213
You wouldn't believe the locker room
they have me sharing at the lair.

17:21.219 --> 17:23.157
My employer thinks I murdered you.

17:23.202 --> 17:24.790
And if he senses any new traces of...

17:24.816 --> 17:25.886
Must be hard...

17:26.006 --> 17:27.489
always keeping your guard up.

17:28.026 --> 17:29.558
Careful not to

17:30.093 --> 17:31.936
betray a single thought.

17:32.180 --> 17:33.939
Or emotion.

17:36.166 --> 17:37.699
Didn't you miss me?

18:00.971 --> 18:02.679
Ugh. You live here?

18:02.799 --> 18:04.412
No sense in putting down roots.

18:04.437 --> 18:05.876
As soon as the work is done I'm gone.

18:05.895 --> 18:08.773
So what exactly is the Red
Avenger working on these days?

18:08.785 --> 18:10.881
Those guys I was trying
to grab at the club,

18:11.369 --> 18:13.171
they weren't purse snatchers.

18:13.291 --> 18:15.284
They're muscle for a Vietnamese gang.

18:15.404 --> 18:16.538
What is all this?

18:16.876 --> 18:20.179
A plot to disrupt the prosecution
of their money laundering operation.

18:20.299 --> 18:22.344
I've been following it
for a few months now.

18:22.369 --> 18:24.901
Jury intimidation, witness tampering,

18:24.902 --> 18:26.573
these guys will stop at nothing.

18:26.916 --> 18:29.284
Not even targeting a
Federal judge and his family.

18:29.776 --> 18:32.035
Which is why I've been
staking out their house.

18:32.155 --> 18:35.807
But first, I'm going to need
to find you guys some tights.

18:36.489 --> 18:38.473
You want to be superheroes,
you gotta dress the part.

18:38.661 --> 18:39.928
Tights?

18:40.143 --> 18:41.396
I'm screwing with you.

18:41.897 --> 18:43.231
Here.

18:43.899 --> 18:45.815
You can carry my calling card.

18:46.367 --> 18:48.088
(BEEPING) What's that?

18:48.157 --> 18:49.809
Judge's home security system.

18:49.929 --> 18:52.236
While we were eating dumplings,
the gang must have made their move.

18:52.273 --> 18:54.425
- We gotta go.
- The cops gotta be on their way, right?

18:54.444 --> 18:56.144
They're only hope is us.

19:00.950 --> 19:02.350
Please.

19:02.591 --> 19:03.685
I'm begging you.

19:04.036 --> 19:05.320
Don't hurt my family.

19:05.888 --> 19:07.664
I'll do whatever you want.

19:09.354 --> 19:10.911
I'm sorry to tell you this.

19:11.175 --> 19:14.516
But your daddy drew the wrong case.

19:19.201 --> 19:20.735
Nifty trick, huh?

19:22.302 --> 19:23.709
Now's the fun part.

19:26.642 --> 19:28.009
What's up?

19:28.238 --> 19:29.534
It's Stephen.

19:29.759 --> 19:31.429
He's using his powers above ground.

19:31.454 --> 19:33.456
- Is he in trouble?
- No, it's weird.

19:34.489 --> 19:36.053
It feels like he's having fun.

19:36.818 --> 19:38.486
(GRUNTING) (SHOUTING)

19:42.529 --> 19:43.961
What's happening?

19:45.427 --> 19:47.027
(GRUNTING)

19:59.317 --> 20:00.963
It's okay. You're safe.

20:01.007 --> 20:02.343
Your family's safe.

20:02.715 --> 20:03.944
- The cops should be here any minute.
- (EXHALES)

20:03.946 --> 20:05.548
How can I ever thank you?

20:05.617 --> 20:06.875
You just did.

20:08.683 --> 20:10.684
(WHOOSHING) (WHOOSHING)

20:14.384 --> 20:15.522
Hey guys.

20:15.857 --> 20:16.924
(GROANING)

20:18.845 --> 20:20.784
Good news. We found a breakout.

20:23.806 --> 20:25.702
What the hell do you
guys think you're doing?

20:26.152 --> 20:28.810
We just saved these people.
Check it, goons, toast.

20:28.811 --> 20:30.663
JOHN: You're not even supposed to be here.

20:32.574 --> 20:34.542
CARA: I just felt a teleport. It's Ultra.

20:34.567 --> 20:36.313
Guys we need to go now.

20:41.586 --> 20:43.338
We must have just missed her.

20:47.355 --> 20:48.822
Yeah.

20:49.190 --> 20:50.290
I guess so.

20:56.698 --> 21:00.038
You used your powers in
front of a Federal judge.

21:00.251 --> 21:01.991
He was blindfolded.

21:02.016 --> 21:04.918
We're trying to save our species
and you're risking it all.

21:05.038 --> 21:07.433
What do you think they'd do if
they knew our kind had powers?

21:07.961 --> 21:10.461
MALLORY: Seems like it worked
out pretty well for Superman.

21:10.864 --> 21:13.466
Spiderman. Batman, kind of.

21:14.460 --> 21:16.350
The list goes on and on.

21:16.470 --> 21:18.357
Could you give us a minute please?

21:18.401 --> 21:19.396
Sure, sorry.

21:19.459 --> 21:22.337
Didn't realize I was
interrupting the secret council.

21:28.675 --> 21:29.557
Look,

21:29.977 --> 21:32.629
maybe it's time to

21:33.217 --> 21:35.163
reconsider our position.

21:36.115 --> 21:40.073
Do some good. We've been playing
an awful lot of defense lately.

21:40.193 --> 21:42.365
Since when are you a philanthropist?

21:43.316 --> 21:45.162
Maybe I'm evolving.

21:46.363 --> 21:50.205
Maybe I don't want to see a teenage
girl get raped by a bunch of gangsters.

21:50.325 --> 21:51.976
We got enough problems, Russell.

21:52.620 --> 21:56.349
Like finding our ghost hero
who's lost in limboland?

21:58.151 --> 21:59.503
No offense, dude.

22:07.653 --> 22:09.956
Sorry I got you in trouble with the rents.

22:11.207 --> 22:12.146
It's all good.

22:12.358 --> 22:14.342
Good. 'Cause I'm not really that sorry.

22:14.517 --> 22:15.699
I mean seriously,

22:15.749 --> 22:17.582
who died and left them in charge anyway?

22:17.619 --> 22:18.697
(CHUCKLES)

22:20.078 --> 22:22.068
Stephen's dad, actually.

22:22.881 --> 22:23.739
Oh.

22:23.989 --> 22:25.090
It's a long story.

22:25.972 --> 22:27.436
Well, I got some time.

22:29.078 --> 22:30.830
This is out of control.

22:33.026 --> 22:34.509
You're the only one I can trust.

22:37.161 --> 22:38.050
What?

22:40.189 --> 22:41.979
I know I should have told you sooner,

22:44.550 --> 22:47.891
but I took Morgan topside to try
to extract intel from Jedikiah.

22:51.639 --> 22:55.468
Was it before or after you
took me topside to have sex?

22:55.668 --> 22:56.913
That is not fair.

22:58.204 --> 22:59.634
I'm sorry,

23:00.191 --> 23:02.080
but we are not holding
her against her will.

23:02.112 --> 23:03.132
Is that right?

23:03.182 --> 23:04.633
You got this all figured out?

23:06.160 --> 23:08.287
Did Morgan tell you she's pregnant?

23:10.295 --> 23:11.915
I didn't think so.

23:15.755 --> 23:16.888
(THUDDING)

23:16.890 --> 23:18.089
(GRUNTS)

23:19.492 --> 23:21.307
STEPHEN: Sorry I missed the big sting.

23:21.427 --> 23:23.978
I heard the Red Avenger person got away.

23:23.990 --> 23:26.479
I'd rather you say nothing than lie to me.

23:26.480 --> 23:28.551
Easy. What are you talking about?

23:28.570 --> 23:29.909
(GRUNTS)

23:32.512 --> 23:34.420
I found something that belongs to you.

23:37.089 --> 23:38.347
Where was this?

23:38.378 --> 23:39.667
The judge's house.

23:39.685 --> 23:42.613
Just as our breakout was
making a clean getaway.

23:43.992 --> 23:45.813
Yeah okay, I was there, too.

23:45.875 --> 23:47.746
I was trying to apprehend the breakout.

23:47.771 --> 23:48.791
Spare me!

23:48.911 --> 23:49.787
(PANTING)

23:50.489 --> 23:52.783
She saved an entire family.

23:53.459 --> 23:57.901
A judge, his wife, his daughter who
couldn't have been older than 15.

23:59.102 --> 24:02.414
If we can't get behind a superhero
then what the hell are we doing?

24:03.031 --> 24:04.035
Wow.

24:04.670 --> 24:06.391
- You do have a heart.
- (LAUGHS)

24:06.973 --> 24:09.300
You don't know a thing about me.

24:16.245 --> 24:17.281
Try me.

24:24.610 --> 24:27.094
Growing up, my family
and I were pretty close.

24:30.084 --> 24:32.812
One night when I was 10, there was

24:33.137 --> 24:34.989
a loud banging at the door.

24:37.097 --> 24:38.786
And three men,

24:38.906 --> 24:40.250
ex-cons,

24:40.294 --> 24:43.372
broke in trying to steal anything
they could trade for a fix.

24:45.136 --> 24:47.652
My mother did everything that they asked.

24:49.209 --> 24:51.650
But my brother was always
trying to be a hero.

24:52.575 --> 24:54.052
And they caught him.

24:54.119 --> 24:55.504
Calling the cops.

24:56.480 --> 24:57.969
So they, um...

24:59.164 --> 25:00.590
they shot 'em all.

25:02.160 --> 25:06.128
(CRYING) And I just laid
there frozen under the bed,

25:06.159 --> 25:08.468
wishing that I had the power to save them.

25:09.388 --> 25:10.376
I'm sorry.

25:10.933 --> 25:12.217
I'm sorry, I didn't...

25:12.337 --> 25:13.617
I had no idea.

25:15.673 --> 25:18.667
After I broke out, I
made a promise to myself.

25:19.477 --> 25:23.434
That I would do everything
in my power to protect people.

25:23.982 --> 25:26.698
That's why I work at Ultra.

25:26.818 --> 25:29.228
That is why I am such a hardass.

25:30.504 --> 25:33.519
Don't you ever leave me hanging again.

25:37.786 --> 25:40.238
So John killed Stephen's dad.

25:40.282 --> 25:41.996
Then you almost killed Stephen

25:41.997 --> 25:44.224
to prove that in fact
his father is not dead.

25:44.268 --> 25:47.321
And now you want to find his
body so he can lead you all to a

25:47.334 --> 25:48.385
promised land.

25:48.422 --> 25:51.219
- (CHUCKLES)
- See this is why I prefer to be a lone wolf.

25:51.238 --> 25:52.345
Far less drama.

25:53.002 --> 25:54.459
Although, I do have to say,

25:54.685 --> 25:56.625
it's been kind of nice having a partner.

25:56.681 --> 25:58.627
Me? (LAUGHS)

25:59.084 --> 26:01.906
Isn't the mission over? I
mean, we saved the judge right?

26:01.918 --> 26:05.203
No. Look, until Om Lam
Chung's behind bars, trust me,

26:05.234 --> 26:06.435
this thing ain't over.

- TIM: Om Lam Chung,</i>

26:08.676 --> 26:12.152
<i>leader of the Made to Kill
Vietnamese American crime syndicate,</i>

26:12.272 --> 26:14.342
<i>currently awaiting trial
under the RICO Act.</i>

26:14.355 --> 26:15.237
Bingo.

26:15.262 --> 26:17.921
What the snooty,
disembodied voice thing said.

26:17.959 --> 26:21.255
<i>TIM: Perhaps I should turn myself
off if my intelligence isn't welcome.</i>

26:21.531 --> 26:23.114
So sensitive.

26:23.526 --> 26:26.743
Look Chung's gang is going to do
anything they can to evade a conviction.

26:26.774 --> 26:28.592
The trial's set to start on Friday.

26:29.008 --> 26:30.961
<i>Hmm. That's what you think.</i>

26:31.485 --> 26:33.061
What, what do you mean, Tim?

26:33.762 --> 26:35.789
Tim, I know you're not sleeping.

26:35.827 --> 26:37.266
I can see your little light pulsing.

26:37.291 --> 26:40.782

his trial was just pulled up 48 hours</i>

26:40.902 --> 26:42.822
<i>according to just-filed

26:42.822 --> 26:44.192
The trial's tomorrow?

26:44.395 --> 26:46.169
We gotta go. Come on. We gotta prep.

26:47.639 --> 26:49.635
- Are you coming?
- Um...

26:50.292 --> 26:52.407
I... I don't know.

26:53.464 --> 26:56.373
We weren't given these powers
so we could hide in a tunnel.

26:57.030 --> 27:00.303
We were born great so that
we may do great things.

27:00.847 --> 27:02.455
That's what Talia said.

27:04.776 --> 27:06.823
Or maybe she was just wrong about you.

27:20.014 --> 27:21.328
Talia?

27:23.587 --> 27:24.532
Talia?

27:37.569 --> 27:40.397
Yeah, security. I need to
report a theft from my room.

27:40.685 --> 27:42.856
No, I know who did it. Her name's Talia.

27:48.235 --> 27:49.900
Where are you going?

27:50.400 --> 27:52.227
I am done taking orders

27:52.240 --> 27:54.297

to a hypothetical cause

27:54.310 --> 27:55.980
when I could be out there helping

27:56.100 --> 27:57.238

Right now.

27:58.577 --> 28:01.161

28:01.956 --> 28:05.674
We act like we have to choose
between working for them

28:05.794 --> 28:07.376
or fighting them.

28:07.910 --> 28:09.444
That's a fake choice.

That's all I think about.

I mean, our future.

it could just be you and me.

29:10.039 --> 29:11.372
How would we raise it?

29:11.807 --> 29:12.955
Human?

29:13.168 --> 29:14.482
Paranormal?

29:14.602 --> 29:16.828
This war is no place to raise a child,

29:16.834 --> 29:19.155

her from saving those people?

I'm gonna stop her from exposing
our kind. She and her partner.

32:56.456 --> 32:58.756
- Partner?
- Two signatures on sight.

32:58.758 --> 33:00.424
