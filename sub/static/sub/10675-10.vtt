00:00.421 --> 00:02.833
♪♪

00:08.759 --> 00:11.892
I love that movie.
I've seen it five times.

00:11.892 --> 00:14.725
Ooh, I hope I didn't
ruin the ending for you guys.

00:14.725 --> 00:18.099
No. You had already
ruined the beginning
and the middle,

00:18.099 --> 00:19.690
so I didn't really care
about the end.

00:20.851 --> 00:23.694
So, uh...

00:23.694 --> 00:24.855
what do you guys
wanna do now?

00:24.855 --> 00:26.737
Oh...

00:26.737 --> 00:29.360
Hey, uh, why don't you
stay right here

00:29.360 --> 00:31.242
while we go have
a quick little team meeting

00:31.242 --> 00:32.703
out on the terrace, okay?

00:32.703 --> 00:33.864
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:37.458 --> 00:40.661
Chase, I know you told AJ
he could hang out with us,

00:40.661 --> 00:43.334
but this is getting ridiculous.
He never leaves.

00:43.334 --> 00:46.297
Yeah. This morning, I came down
for a bowl of cereal,

00:46.297 --> 00:48.469
and he poured my milk,

00:48.469 --> 00:50.761
which was nice,
but kinda creepy.

00:50.761 --> 00:52.883
That's creepy?

00:52.883 --> 00:55.886
This morning, you offered
to be the milk in my cereal.

00:58.179 --> 01:00.351
( stammering )

01:00.351 --> 01:02.353
I didn't...
Offer still stands.

01:04.815 --> 01:06.777
Look, guys, the only reason

01:06.777 --> 01:08.529
that AJ's been
hanging around so much

01:08.529 --> 01:10.191
is 'cause
he doesn't have any friends.

01:10.191 --> 01:13.364
So he's a mini you.
Got it.

01:13.364 --> 01:16.957
Look, and it is nice
that you're looking out for him,

01:16.957 --> 01:18.829
but we just need
a little bit of space.

01:18.829 --> 01:22.163
Yeah, and not to mention,
it's really risky.

01:22.163 --> 01:25.256
We have to keep our superhero
status a secret.

01:25.256 --> 01:27.548
Okay.

01:27.548 --> 01:29.009
I get it.

01:29.009 --> 01:30.841
I'll go break his heart
and tell him

01:30.841 --> 01:32.553
he can't hang out
with us as much.

01:35.766 --> 01:37.518
Great cookies.

01:37.518 --> 01:40.601
Got anything
to wet my whistle?

01:40.601 --> 01:42.683
Oliver can be
your milk.

01:45.526 --> 01:47.988
Uh, look, AJ,
we should talk.

01:49.610 --> 01:53.364
There's been some concern,
mostly from the others,

01:53.364 --> 01:56.036
about you being
around so much.

01:56.036 --> 01:59.240
- Eh. I get it.
- You do?

01:59.240 --> 02:03.043
Of course. They're afraid
I'm gonna find out
they're superheroes.

02:03.043 --> 02:04.835
- Whoa!
- Us?

02:04.835 --> 02:07.047
That's crazy.

02:07.047 --> 02:08.419
Yeah. We're bionic.

02:08.419 --> 02:10.881
Uh, no, you're not.

02:10.881 --> 02:13.464
She's an alien, and
you two touched
the Arcturian space rock.

02:13.464 --> 02:16.016
He knows too much.

02:16.016 --> 02:17.808
- Light up your fire hand.
We gotta take him out.
- Oliver!

02:19.099 --> 02:21.602
You're right.
We don't wanna make a mess.

02:21.602 --> 02:24.185
Better freeze this punk.

03:09.770 --> 03:12.072
How did you know
we were superheroes?

03:12.072 --> 03:14.775
It's my fault.

03:14.775 --> 03:19.029
I'm just way too heroic-looking
to pass for normal.

03:20.120 --> 03:23.374
I've known your secret
for weeks.

03:23.374 --> 03:25.746
Okay, I don't like this.

03:25.746 --> 03:29.129
Who knows what else is in
that little cat-toy-sized
head of his?

03:29.129 --> 03:31.752
If AJ tells the public
that superheroes exist,

03:31.752 --> 03:33.213
it'll cause hysteria.

03:33.213 --> 03:35.506
Not to mention we'll be
under a microscope

03:35.506 --> 03:37.097
which will make tracking
Roman and Riker even harder.

03:37.097 --> 03:39.009
Why would I sell you out

03:39.009 --> 03:41.802
when I'm trying to convince you
to make me a part of the team?

03:41.802 --> 03:43.684
He's right.

03:43.684 --> 03:45.686
Look, AJ's a smart kid.
I think we can trust him.

03:45.686 --> 03:47.848
Or can we?

03:49.940 --> 03:52.523
He didn't flinch.
I think we're good.

03:53.944 --> 03:55.316
Now that we're cool,
there's something

03:55.316 --> 03:57.117
I wanna show you guys.

03:57.117 --> 04:01.121
My Elite Force breakdown.

04:01.121 --> 04:03.994
I compiled all your abilities
and superpowers,

04:03.994 --> 04:05.366
and then ranked your value
to the team,

04:05.366 --> 04:06.627
one through five.

04:08.959 --> 04:11.001
Uh, why am I third?

04:11.001 --> 04:14.795
Skylar has 24 powers,
and you have five.

04:16.136 --> 04:18.258
All right, Oliver,
freeze that punk.

04:20.180 --> 04:22.142
Don't be upset.

04:22.142 --> 04:23.183
It's not like you're last.

04:24.305 --> 04:27.017
Chase is.

04:27.017 --> 04:28.519
What?!

04:28.519 --> 04:29.730
Relax.

04:29.730 --> 04:31.522
It's not personal.

04:31.522 --> 04:33.103
It's just accurate.

04:39.239 --> 04:40.991
Hey, guys.

04:40.991 --> 04:42.242
What you working on?

04:42.242 --> 04:44.204
Well, Chase wants to
move up the list,

04:44.204 --> 04:46.787
so I'm helping him
find a way to get to
missions faster.

04:46.787 --> 04:50.000
You and Kaz fly,
Bree and Skylar
have super speed.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.042
And Chase has a bus pass.

04:53.544 --> 04:56.126
Hey, it's not just
a bus pass.

04:56.126 --> 04:58.088
It also works for
the subway.

04:59.590 --> 05:01.592
Anyway, a few days ago,

05:01.592 --> 05:05.516
I came up with
the idea for this.

05:05.516 --> 05:07.428
A high-tech hover bike

05:07.428 --> 05:10.190
that will speed him
to missions in no time.

05:10.190 --> 05:11.932
Cool. How does it work?

05:11.932 --> 05:15.105
The hover technology allows it
to float off the ground,

05:15.105 --> 05:18.028
and just wait till you see
how fast it goes.

05:27.157 --> 05:30.411
Hey, why am I going
so slow?

05:30.411 --> 05:32.623
Oh, let me try this.

05:37.588 --> 05:39.630
( groaning )

05:39.630 --> 05:43.093
Well, at least we know
the helmet works.

05:48.519 --> 05:51.812
Kaz? What were you
doing out there?

05:53.103 --> 05:55.646
I was, uh,

05:55.646 --> 05:59.610
Chase, what's the word for
exploring underground passages?

05:59.610 --> 06:01.361
Spelunking.

06:01.361 --> 06:05.536
Yeah, I was exploring
underground passages.

06:07.658 --> 06:09.990
Wait.

06:09.990 --> 06:11.702
I know that fake smile.

06:11.702 --> 06:13.454
You're up to something.

06:13.454 --> 06:14.755
What are you hiding
out there?

06:14.755 --> 06:16.457
Nothing.

06:23.504 --> 06:25.385
Oh, yeah, I'm through!

06:29.009 --> 06:31.642
Cool.

06:31.642 --> 06:33.684
What is all this junk?

06:33.684 --> 06:36.567
It's not junk.
They're my mementoes.

06:36.567 --> 06:38.358
I can never throw
anything away.

06:39.570 --> 06:41.782
I can't help it;
I'm a hoarder.

06:43.323 --> 06:46.657
Ugh. Is this your retainer?

06:46.657 --> 06:49.790
It's a retainer.
Try it on, I did.

06:49.790 --> 06:51.582
Eww!

06:51.582 --> 06:53.293
Whoa.

06:53.293 --> 06:56.206
- What's this?
- That's the Arcturian.

06:56.206 --> 06:58.999
This is what gave you two
your super powers?

06:58.999 --> 07:03.884
Ah, the pyramid with
the glowy racquetball inside.

07:03.884 --> 07:05.596
Now that is science.

07:06.717 --> 07:08.388
I thought it was destroyed

07:08.388 --> 07:10.140
when Roman and Riker
took out Mighty Med.

07:10.140 --> 07:11.722
I thought so, too.

07:11.722 --> 07:14.144
It must've ended up in
one of those storage bins.

07:14.144 --> 07:15.856
I didn't even know
it was down here.

07:15.856 --> 07:17.057
How do you open it?

07:17.057 --> 07:18.559
You don't.

07:18.559 --> 07:20.821
If any human makes
direct contact with the orb,

07:20.821 --> 07:22.362
it'll kill them.

07:22.362 --> 07:24.615
It's the coolest thing
I've ever seen.

07:24.615 --> 07:26.366
- I just wanna...
- No.

07:26.366 --> 07:27.778
- ...touch it so...
- No.

07:27.778 --> 07:29.239
- ...study it.
- No!

07:29.239 --> 07:31.161
Go over there
and play with the retainer.

07:33.243 --> 07:35.375
Look, guys, we can't have
something this dangerous

07:35.375 --> 07:37.247
just lying around.

07:37.247 --> 07:39.209
Mr. Davenport has
a secure storage area

07:39.209 --> 07:40.711
called Facility Y
where it'll be safe.

07:40.711 --> 07:42.132
You two take it there.

07:44.715 --> 07:48.549
Why would you save this?

07:48.549 --> 07:51.181
I didn't.
That's a dead rat.

07:55.305 --> 07:56.767
Hey, Bree.

07:56.767 --> 07:58.358
Yeah, whatever.

07:58.358 --> 08:02.232
Are you still mad about
being below me on AJ's list?

08:02.232 --> 08:03.443
Pssh!

08:03.443 --> 08:05.275
No. He's just a kid.

08:05.275 --> 08:08.318
What does he know about
ranking heroes?

08:08.318 --> 08:10.280
Well, he is pretty smart,

08:10.280 --> 08:13.874
and he did calculate everything
based on facts and statistics.

08:13.874 --> 08:15.706
And he does have a point
that I have a lot more powers--

08:15.706 --> 08:17.788
I understand
his thorough reasoning!

08:19.880 --> 08:22.923
Okay, look, I don't need
a million powers.

08:22.923 --> 08:25.836
Okay, I'm great at
the ones I have.

08:25.836 --> 08:28.258
Why do we need a list to tell us
who's better than anyone else?

08:28.258 --> 08:30.510
We're heroes, we're all
good at what we do.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.472
- I couldn't agree more.
- Good.

08:32.472 --> 08:34.304
Where are you going?

08:34.304 --> 08:36.226
To practice my abilities
so I can be better than you.

08:39.439 --> 08:41.101
Oh, what's that?

08:41.101 --> 08:43.353
The Arcturian space rock.

08:43.353 --> 08:46.647
Wait, that thing that gave you
your super powers?

08:46.647 --> 08:49.279
I always imagined
it would be inside of
some sort of magic lamp.

08:49.279 --> 08:51.071
Oh, that's just
ridiculous.

08:51.071 --> 08:53.153
Where would
the genie live?

08:57.497 --> 09:00.250
I don't even wanna know
why that's here,

09:00.250 --> 09:02.082
but you need to
get rid of it right away.

09:02.082 --> 09:03.964
Already on it.

09:03.964 --> 09:05.335
We're taking it to
Mr. Davenport's
storage facility.

09:05.335 --> 09:07.167
Good. I would take it myself,

09:07.167 --> 09:09.009
but that really
seems like a job

09:09.009 --> 09:11.592
for number two
and number four.

09:13.133 --> 09:15.936
You know, I was thinking.

09:15.936 --> 09:18.639
We got powers
from this once.

09:18.639 --> 09:20.270
Maybe before we take it back,

09:20.270 --> 09:22.733
we can find a safe way
to touch the orb

09:22.733 --> 09:24.314
and get even more powers.

09:24.314 --> 09:27.778
I don't know....

09:27.778 --> 09:30.991
a single thing about
that idea I don't love!

09:34.905 --> 09:36.576
Hey, Bree.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.869
You're just in time to watch
our latest test run.

09:38.869 --> 09:42.002
Oh, is Chase gonna get hurt?
If so, I'm in.

09:43.704 --> 09:44.795
Not gonna happen.

09:44.795 --> 09:46.586
We worked out all the kinks.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.709
Soon I'll be able to get
to missions as fast as you.

09:48.709 --> 09:50.340
Then you'll be at
the bottom of the list,

09:50.340 --> 09:52.673
and I'll be at the top.

09:52.673 --> 09:54.384
Uh, no, you won't.

09:54.384 --> 09:56.717
Okay, you are not in charge
of the list anymore!

10:02.352 --> 10:04.434
Whoo hoo!

10:04.434 --> 10:06.647
Doesn't look that fast.

10:06.647 --> 10:10.440
Really? 'Cause I clocked him
going faster than you.

10:10.440 --> 10:12.653
No, you didn't.
Let me see that.

10:14.194 --> 10:16.496
Okay, you know what?
I don't have time for this.

10:16.496 --> 10:18.408
Just call me when
he crashes.

10:24.124 --> 10:26.086
The brakes aren't working!

10:32.422 --> 10:35.345
Oh, Bree.

10:40.931 --> 10:43.433
What is that?

10:45.936 --> 10:47.978
Uh, this is... uh,

10:47.978 --> 10:51.531
garden shear
pool noodle plunger.

10:54.444 --> 10:56.196
Obviously.

10:56.196 --> 10:58.328
What's going on?

10:58.328 --> 10:59.830
We built this because we wanted
to touch the Arcturian

10:59.830 --> 11:01.451
without getting zapped.

11:01.451 --> 11:04.544
Wait. You still have it?

11:04.544 --> 11:06.917
Get rid of it like
I told you to yesterday.

11:06.917 --> 11:08.588
Fine.

11:08.588 --> 11:10.751
Consider it gone.

11:12.843 --> 11:14.925
Actually, it is gone.

11:16.346 --> 11:18.058
What do you mean
it's gone?

11:18.058 --> 11:20.010
Someone must've taken it.

11:20.010 --> 11:21.641
I bet it was AJ.

11:21.641 --> 11:23.974
He wanted the Arcturian
as soon as he saw it.

11:23.974 --> 11:28.068
Hey, guys, did you see me
on the news last night?

11:28.068 --> 11:29.940
I told everyone
you were superheroes.

11:29.940 --> 11:32.362
What?!

11:32.362 --> 11:35.816
Kidding.
You guys gotta lighten up.

11:35.816 --> 11:39.159
We know what you did, AJ.

11:39.159 --> 11:40.781
Give us back
the space rock.

11:40.781 --> 11:42.743
What are you talking about?

11:42.743 --> 11:45.705
It's missing, and everyone saw
how badly you wanted it.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.497
No, I didn't take it.

11:47.497 --> 11:49.419
I swear.

11:49.419 --> 11:51.631
I can't believe
you're lying to me.

11:51.631 --> 11:54.044
You know what, AJ?
If you're not gonna admit it,

11:54.044 --> 11:56.046
then we're not gonna
be friends anymore.

11:56.046 --> 11:58.718
- What?
- You heard me.

11:58.718 --> 12:01.181
Get out.

12:05.685 --> 12:08.018
Don't feel bad, Chase.

12:08.018 --> 12:09.479
It had to be him.

12:09.479 --> 12:11.691
I mean, the only other person
who knew about

12:11.691 --> 12:13.443
the Arcturian was...

12:15.615 --> 12:16.406
Oh, no.

12:25.495 --> 12:26.827
No, Bree, don't!

12:47.597 --> 12:48.478
What did you
blast me for?

12:48.478 --> 12:50.270
I wasn't aiming at you.

12:50.270 --> 12:53.023
I just wanted to knock you
away from the Arcturian.

12:53.023 --> 12:55.315
I was trying
to save your life.

12:55.315 --> 12:57.197
Yeah. If you'd
actually touched it,

12:57.197 --> 13:01.401
let's just see there'd be
one less person on AJ's list.

13:02.863 --> 13:06.907
Just to be clear, Chase,
you'd still be at the bottom.

13:06.907 --> 13:10.710
Wait, so the rock
could've killed me?

13:10.710 --> 13:14.504
Yeah. What were you doing
with it in the first place?

13:14.504 --> 13:16.176
I don't know.

13:16.176 --> 13:17.627
I found it in
the cabinet.

13:17.627 --> 13:20.720
I thought if I touched it,
I'd get more powers.

13:20.720 --> 13:23.723
Why would you want
more powers?

13:23.723 --> 13:25.976
Yeah, I mean,
we can understand Chase...

13:25.976 --> 13:28.598
Okay, we get it.
I'm at the bottom!

13:30.640 --> 13:35.695
Bree, what's going on?

13:35.695 --> 13:38.608
Speed has always been
my thing.

13:40.780 --> 13:43.533
When Skylar came in,
and had speed, too,

13:43.533 --> 13:46.656
it just made me feel
less important.

13:46.656 --> 13:48.869
You know that's not true.

13:48.869 --> 13:52.662
Yeah, but when I saw my name
near the bottom of AJ's list,

13:52.662 --> 13:56.456
I realized that other people
think I'm unimportant, too.

13:59.960 --> 14:02.762
I know that touching
the rock was selfish, but...

14:05.425 --> 14:08.428
I just wanted to feel
special again.

14:08.428 --> 14:10.470
I get it.

14:10.470 --> 14:13.433
But it's just too risky.

14:13.433 --> 14:16.066
I'll take the Arcturian
back to Facility Y.

14:16.066 --> 14:18.148
You know,
that's pretty far.

14:18.148 --> 14:20.240
Maybe we should just
keep it in the cupboard

14:20.240 --> 14:22.032
and hope for the best.

14:28.038 --> 14:31.121
Hey, where's
the hover bike?

14:31.121 --> 14:32.832
AJ.

14:32.832 --> 14:34.915
That sneaky little punk.

14:34.915 --> 14:37.377
No, it's not his fault.

14:37.377 --> 14:39.339
It's mine.

14:39.339 --> 14:41.461
I accused him
of taking the Arcturian.

14:41.461 --> 14:44.594
He's just trying to get
back at me by stealing the bike.

14:44.594 --> 14:47.387
Look, I can track him
using the bike's locator.

14:47.387 --> 14:49.139
( beeping )

14:49.139 --> 14:50.890
Looks like he's joy-riding
around the tunnels.

14:50.890 --> 14:53.563
We can cut him off
this way.

14:55.775 --> 14:58.979
Bree, are you okay?

14:58.979 --> 15:00.780
I don't know.

15:00.780 --> 15:03.613
Ever since you zapped me,
I've been in a lot of pain.

15:03.613 --> 15:05.695
That's weird.

15:05.695 --> 15:07.407
I didn't even fire
at full strength.

15:08.828 --> 15:10.490
Hold on.

15:10.490 --> 15:12.662
When my lightning blast
ricocheted off the orb,

15:12.662 --> 15:14.414
it must've magnified
my power.

15:14.414 --> 15:16.626
That's why you're...
Bree!

15:16.626 --> 15:19.209
Bree.

15:21.211 --> 15:24.004
Okay, AJ should be speeding
through here any second now.

15:24.004 --> 15:25.505
Guys, get in position.

15:25.505 --> 15:27.637
- Got it.
- Right.

15:27.637 --> 15:29.849
Uh, question.

15:29.849 --> 15:32.392
What exactly is
the standard position

15:32.392 --> 15:34.644
for catching a ten-year-old
on a hover bike?

15:36.396 --> 15:39.059
Well, we could go with
the teapot,

15:39.059 --> 15:41.771
or a capital L
and maybe a back bridge.

15:41.771 --> 15:43.823
Just stand on opposite sides!

15:47.407 --> 15:49.069
Here he comes.

15:51.701 --> 15:52.993
Gotcha!

15:57.207 --> 15:59.579
We probably should've gone
with the teapot.

16:02.292 --> 16:05.465
What's with
all the smoke?

16:08.508 --> 16:10.300
Oh, no.
AJ isn't heavy enough

16:10.300 --> 16:12.472
to keep the bike under
its maximum velocity.

16:12.472 --> 16:14.184
The engine is burning up.

16:14.184 --> 16:16.306
You guys have to fly there
and save him before it blows.

16:16.306 --> 16:18.188
What about you?
Aren't you gonna come with us?

16:18.188 --> 16:21.481
He can't. Bus doesn't
come for another half an hour.

16:26.526 --> 16:30.200
Chase, Kaz,
somebody help!

16:30.200 --> 16:32.872
This is all my fault.

16:32.872 --> 16:35.455
If I hadn't bragged about
my super powers

16:35.455 --> 16:38.958
and made you jealous,
none of this would've happened.

16:38.958 --> 16:42.792
No. It's my fault for thinking
the rock would fix everything.

16:42.792 --> 16:46.586
Wait.
Maybe it can.

16:46.586 --> 16:49.929
The supernatural energy from
the Arcturian should heal you.

16:49.929 --> 16:51.891
If I touch it,
then the healing energy

16:51.891 --> 16:53.183
will pass through me to you,

16:53.183 --> 16:55.515
and my super powers
should protect me.

16:58.558 --> 17:02.192
No. It's too dangerous.
I'm not letting you do this.

17:02.192 --> 17:03.943
And I'm not
letting you die.

17:22.372 --> 17:25.965
Whoo hoo! Yeah!

17:25.965 --> 17:28.258
( AJ whooping )

17:30.049 --> 17:31.971
- AJ!
- ( screams )

17:31.971 --> 17:33.973
What are you doing?

17:33.973 --> 17:35.555
We know you didn't
take the Arcturian.

17:35.555 --> 17:37.347
Tell me something
I don't know.

17:37.347 --> 17:39.939
Your hover bike's
about to explode.

17:39.939 --> 17:41.231
What?!

17:41.231 --> 17:43.643
It's going too fast,
the engine is smoking.

17:45.105 --> 17:46.946
And now it's on fire.

17:46.946 --> 17:48.778
( shrieks )

17:48.778 --> 17:50.990
What are we
going to do?

17:50.990 --> 17:52.322
BOTH: Jump!

17:56.996 --> 17:59.119
AJ, are you okay?

17:59.119 --> 18:00.790
Yeah, but I'm not AJ.

18:03.793 --> 18:05.205
I'm over here.

18:05.205 --> 18:08.298
( explosion )

18:08.298 --> 18:10.670
Wow.

18:10.670 --> 18:13.052
You guys
saved my life.

18:13.052 --> 18:15.595
I took these from
your junk pile.

18:15.595 --> 18:17.637
I got here
as fast as I could.

18:19.429 --> 18:20.890
( Chase yelling )

18:27.106 --> 18:30.440
Bree, are you okay?

18:30.440 --> 18:32.442
Wait, you have six heads.

18:32.442 --> 18:35.195
Is this an alien thing
or am I just dizzy?

18:36.496 --> 18:38.658
You're dizzy.
Wait.

18:40.950 --> 18:42.202
Yeah, it's you.

18:44.374 --> 18:45.665
Wow.

18:45.665 --> 18:48.458
I feel great.

18:48.458 --> 18:49.589
How are you?

18:49.589 --> 18:51.711
I'm fine.

18:52.882 --> 18:54.964
Okay.

18:54.964 --> 18:57.597
I lost a few of my powers.

18:57.597 --> 19:00.260
What? Why didn't you
tell me that could happen?

19:00.260 --> 19:03.393
Because if I did,
you wouldn't have let me do it.

19:03.393 --> 19:06.145
Look, Bree, I would've
given up all my powers

19:06.145 --> 19:08.027
to save you.

19:08.027 --> 19:11.150
I don't even know
what to say.

19:11.150 --> 19:12.902
Thank you.

19:14.073 --> 19:15.985
- Ow, ow, ow!
- Whoa, what just happened?

19:15.985 --> 19:17.197
Ow!

19:20.950 --> 19:24.874
You burned my brand-new shirt,
that's what just happened.

19:27.337 --> 19:29.128
Um...

19:29.128 --> 19:32.592
Skylar.

19:32.592 --> 19:34.554
Whoa.
That's thermo-touch.

19:36.716 --> 19:39.799
You made indirect contact
with the Arcturian.

19:39.799 --> 19:42.512
Bree, you have
super powers.

19:42.512 --> 19:44.394
What?!

19:44.394 --> 19:45.895
Whoa! Okay, what is that?

19:47.517 --> 19:49.108
It's a proton ring.

19:49.108 --> 19:50.770
What do I do with it?

19:50.770 --> 19:51.941
Throw it.

19:59.118 --> 19:59.989
That felt amazing.

20:01.911 --> 20:04.494
It is supposed to go
in a circle, right?

20:04.494 --> 20:08.087
I am so excited for you.

20:08.087 --> 20:09.459
Come on, let's go
tell everyone.

20:09.459 --> 20:12.041
I cannot wait to see
Chase's face when he finds out.

20:12.041 --> 20:15.335
Uh, I actually kind of
wanna hold off

20:15.335 --> 20:17.096
for a little bit.

20:17.096 --> 20:18.598
It's a lot to take in.

20:18.598 --> 20:21.100
Okay. It'll be
our little secret.

20:21.100 --> 20:23.723
Wow, I can't believe I actually
have super powers.

20:23.723 --> 20:25.265
That makes me--

20:25.265 --> 20:28.438
The world's first
bionic superhero hybrid.

20:28.438 --> 20:30.650
I was gonna say
number one on AJ's list,

20:30.650 --> 20:32.522
but that works, too.

20:39.779 --> 20:41.951
Is everything okay
with you and Chase?

20:41.951 --> 20:44.574
Yeah. It hurt my feelings
that he didn't believe me,

20:44.574 --> 20:46.456
but we're good now.

20:46.456 --> 20:49.168
I've also decided to
get rid of the list,

20:49.168 --> 20:52.962
because everyone on the team
has their own unique value.

20:52.962 --> 20:55.084
Chase told you
to say that, didn't he?

20:55.084 --> 20:56.966
Yes, he did.

20:56.966 --> 21:00.300
Well, I'm glad you guys
worked everything out.

21:00.300 --> 21:03.973
but I was kinda hoping
you'd still wanna get back at
him for not trusting you.

21:03.973 --> 21:05.435
Why?

21:05.435 --> 21:07.146
Because I have a really
awesome prank

21:07.146 --> 21:08.978
I've been dying
to pull on him.

21:10.770 --> 21:14.023
Oliver, that is so immature.

21:14.023 --> 21:16.195
Let's do it!

21:16.195 --> 21:19.949
All right!
Watch this.

21:19.949 --> 21:22.822
Chase, get up here quick.
There's a mission alert!

21:22.822 --> 21:24.404
CHASE: I'll be right there.

21:27.246 --> 21:29.409
Whoa, stairs!

21:29.409 --> 21:31.831
That could not
have gone better.
