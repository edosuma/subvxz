<i># Every kiss I get is stolen</i>

00:16.836 --> 00:21.495

00:22.438 --> 00:28.189

00:54.652 --> 00:56.486
How many is that now?

00:58.656 --> 01:00.466
You need to call him a taxi.

01:01.846 --> 01:03.914
I'm not trying to be mean.

01:07.926 --> 01:09.823
It's that old guy again.

01:12.409 --> 01:15.502
- Should you let the manager know?
- The guy hasn't done anything.

01:15.612 --> 01:19.589
That's how it is with creeps, right up until
the day that they decide to do something.

01:19.669 --> 01:22.343
- He's probably harmless.
- Nobody's harmless...

01:22.423 --> 01:24.681
...especially a male, nobody.

01:24.761 --> 01:27.867
Excuse me. Can I sit down?

01:28.547 --> 01:31.428
You're allowed to sit wherever you'd like.

01:32.608 --> 01:35.718
- Thank you.
- What would you like to drink?

01:35.798 --> 01:37.647
A soda water...

01:38.294 --> 01:40.128
...with lemon.

01:40.337 --> 01:42.574
Please cut it in half.

01:47.305 --> 01:50.381
- That's $1.
- Thank you.

01:55.618 --> 01:57.366
Here.

01:57.446 --> 01:59.933
Have anything smaller than that?

02:00.013 --> 02:02.949
All my bills are that size.

02:03.669 --> 02:05.522
I'll get you your change.

02:06.542 --> 02:10.285
During my prior visits
to this establishment...

02:10.365 --> 02:14.771
...you were tending the bar.
Do you really enjoy that work?

02:14.851 --> 02:17.516
When the customers are respectful, I do.

02:18.336 --> 02:19.880
Mm.

02:21.382 --> 02:23.261
But, uh...

02:24.429 --> 02:26.669
...you have ambitions, don't you?

02:26.749 --> 02:28.366
That's not any of your business.

02:28.446 --> 02:31.021
Perhaps I'm mistaken...

02:31.101 --> 02:35.273
...I am from Europe and do not know
all of these local customs...

02:35.353 --> 02:40.699
...but I thought that the primary
responsibility of a bartender...

02:40.779 --> 02:46.076
...is to serve and engage
the customers in a conversation.

02:48.845 --> 02:53.303
Is companionship something that you offer?

02:54.503 --> 02:58.034
Make one more insinuation,
and I'll have you thrown out.

02:59.508 --> 03:00.980
Cheers.

03:08.212 --> 03:10.656
So, where are you from in Europe?

03:10.736 --> 03:12.584
I'm from France.

03:12.664 --> 03:16.684
My father is French, and my mother is German.

03:17.164 --> 03:19.744
But I lived in many places.

03:20.224 --> 03:24.132
Well, I don't know how things are
back there, but in this country...

03:24.212 --> 03:27.503
...people don't wear hats when they
sit down someplace to have a drink.

03:28.537 --> 03:31.603
So, you want me to take my hat off?

03:31.683 --> 03:35.373
I'm letting you know the customs,
since you're such a respectful guy.

03:41.637 --> 03:43.093
Tell me something.

03:43.173 --> 03:46.703
Are you an acquaintance of hers?

03:47.947 --> 03:52.792
Bartender? The man here wants
to know if we're acquainted.

04:08.794 --> 04:11.808
Disgusting homosexuals.

04:27.670 --> 04:29.996
Mind if I turn it down a bit?

04:30.076 --> 04:31.677
Too loud?

04:31.761 --> 04:34.608
No. I just want to talk about something.

04:35.138 --> 04:36.960
What's on your mind?

04:37.040 --> 04:40.502
Well... what we talked about last week.

04:43.679 --> 04:45.430
Having a baby?

04:45.510 --> 04:47.806
Yeah. I think...

04:48.486 --> 04:51.135
...I think now would be the perfect time.

04:51.215 --> 04:53.020
Me too.

04:55.084 --> 04:57.877
- Did you hear that?
- It came from the back.

06:12.520 --> 06:14.948
Harrow, come take a look at this.

06:23.189 --> 06:26.365
Maybe like a... a raccoon,
when it stands on its hind legs...

06:26.445 --> 06:28.496
...begging for scraps?

06:29.269 --> 06:31.159
I'll call it in.

07:03.173 --> 07:05.243
Get ready for something different.

07:21.852 --> 07:23.517
Freeze!

10:45.569 --> 10:47.460
Hello, Dad.

10:49.586 --> 10:51.909
- You letting yourself go?
- What?

10:52.009 --> 10:55.704
- That stain on your face.
- Oh. I'm, um...

10:56.384 --> 10:59.342
...working on a beard.
Thought I'd try a new look.

10:59.422 --> 11:03.868
Well, you might want to remove some
of that jewelry you got on. It's dated.

11:03.948 --> 11:05.513
Oh.

11:06.485 --> 11:08.706
I do not remember putting that on.

11:09.214 --> 11:10.470
Eddy!

11:10.750 --> 11:12.616
- Mom.
- Oh! How are you?

11:12.696 --> 11:14.649
- I'm fine. I'm fine.
- That's good.

11:14.729 --> 11:16.242
- Yeah.
- You look well.

11:16.322 --> 11:18.571
- Don't patronize him.
- I'm not.

11:18.651 --> 11:22.548
Divorce can be very hard to go through,
and I think you look very well...

11:22.628 --> 11:24.820
...especially when you consider...

11:25.200 --> 11:28.937
I cleaned up your old room.
Any idea how long you intend to stay?

11:29.017 --> 11:31.944
Uh, well, I'm gonna look for apartments
when I'm off work this weekend, so...

11:32.024 --> 11:34.456
- ...I don't think very long.
- I'd like that in writing.

11:34.536 --> 11:36.595
Oh, you are a delight.

12:26.726 --> 12:29.267
Are you feeling sorry for yourself...

12:29.347 --> 12:32.143
...coming in here,
going through his stuff, wallowing?

12:32.223 --> 12:36.887
Dad, if you don't want me here,
just say so, but Mom invited me, okay?

12:36.967 --> 12:41.942
You've been at your worst since I got here,
and, also, your best is... not great, so...

12:42.022 --> 12:45.698
Your lecture would have had a lot more impact
if you weren't holding a doll in your hands.

12:45.778 --> 12:49.627
- You know what? I can just go stay at...
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

12:50.777 --> 12:53.099
Your mom wants you here, it's fine by me.

12:54.928 --> 12:57.654
- Okay.
- Any of that stuff valuable?

12:57.734 --> 13:00.711
That box has just been sitting
in that closet forever.

13:00.791 --> 13:03.540
Well, you wanna sell it
on the computer, keep the cash.

13:03.620 --> 13:05.192
No.

13:06.068 --> 13:08.545
I don't think I'd sell any of this stuff, no.

13:08.625 --> 13:11.325
All right. Up to you.

13:11.405 --> 13:13.506
Home by 7:00, you can have dinner with us.

13:13.586 --> 13:16.074
If not, we'll set something aside for you.

13:16.154 --> 13:17.805
Thanks.

13:17.885 --> 13:19.454
You know...

13:19.534 --> 13:23.852
...I was disappointed when I found out
you and Jennifer separated.

13:23.932 --> 13:26.576
I really thought she'd make a good mother.

13:26.756 --> 13:28.961
She was a real good looker, too...

13:30.851 --> 13:33.061
...especially for a guy who...

13:33.141 --> 13:35.341
...works in a comic-book store and draws.

13:35.421 --> 13:37.814
I'm sure that was supposed to come out nicer.

13:38.468 --> 13:40.059
Yeah.

13:48.390 --> 13:51.491
Hey. That'll be $12.

13:54.963 --> 13:59.348
- I've got $9.85. Can you do some type...
- No, no, no, no, no, no. No charity, okay?

13:59.428 --> 14:02.044
If you don't have enough, you can steal
from your mommy like everybody else.

14:02.124 --> 14:05.080
- You're a jerk-off.
- Perhaps I am, yes...

14:05.160 --> 14:08.073
...but that does not diminish
the value of my advice to you.

14:08.153 --> 14:11.173
You want me to hold these back here
or put them back on the shelves?

14:11.253 --> 14:13.349
You can hold them.

14:13.429 --> 14:17.875
- You drawing anything new these days?
- Hmm? No, not really.

14:17.955 --> 14:19.877
You should do more Madame Lightning.

14:19.957 --> 14:22.406
- Mm, maybe.
- She's hot.

14:25.484 --> 14:29.091
- I think you should work on something new.
- Yeah, I will. I just, um...

14:29.171 --> 14:30.781
...I've been very, uh...

14:32.261 --> 14:33.519
Distracted.

14:37.540 --> 14:39.642
You've been pretty distracted.

14:39.722 --> 14:41.761
Oh, yeah, I have been.

15:10.250 --> 15:12.982
- Eddy Easton?
- Yeah?

15:13.662 --> 15:15.491
Do you remember me?

15:15.571 --> 15:20.089
- I'm Ashley... Ashley Summers.
- Oh, my God. Mike's little sister.

15:20.169 --> 15:22.274
- Yeah. You remember.
- Oh. Wow.

15:22.354 --> 15:24.950
I know I looked kind of
different before, but...

15:25.030 --> 15:28.363
- Are you still over there?
- Mm-hmm, yeah. But it's just me now.

15:28.443 --> 15:31.117
Mike's in the Coast Guard.
I don't know if he told you.

15:31.197 --> 15:34.646
And my parents moved to Florida, so...

15:35.092 --> 15:39.025
- Oh, sorry. Am I interrupting you? I...
- No, I... I was looking at the old thing...

15:39.105 --> 15:42.830
...'cause, um, honestly, work was bad, and...

15:42.910 --> 15:46.725
...the idea of having dinner
with my parents right now is, uh...

15:47.705 --> 15:50.663
You wanna join us for a walk
around the block?

15:54.469 --> 15:56.877
Oh. You're walking a cat.

15:56.957 --> 15:59.856
Hypothetically. Yeah.

15:59.936 --> 16:03.428
- So, what are you doing now?
- I'm getting a sociology degree...

16:03.508 --> 16:06.067
- ...and working at a record shop.
- Oh, cool.

16:06.147 --> 16:09.440
I love records. I mean, when they first
came out, we called them "records..."

16:09.520 --> 16:14.523
...before they were "vinyl" when hipster
douchebags just made them to seem all retro.

16:15.253 --> 16:16.763
Yeah.

16:16.843 --> 16:21.011
But, honestly, I'd probably agree with
any statement that contained the phrase...

16:21.091 --> 16:23.475
"...hipster douchebags."

16:23.715 --> 16:25.916
- Sorry.
- Oh. So...

16:26.996 --> 16:28.814
...will Rhonda get jealous
if I ask you for your number?

16:28.894 --> 16:30.960
- Yes.
- Okay.

16:31.040 --> 16:32.805
But she can deal.

16:53.863 --> 16:55.294
Hello.

17:13.143 --> 17:15.310
Do you want to go to the auction, hmm?

17:17.626 --> 17:19.210
Shit!

17:26.199 --> 17:28.814
Jesus. Ow.

17:31.827 --> 17:33.388
Ow.

17:34.344 --> 17:35.934
Ow.

17:47.780 --> 17:48.882
Fuck.

17:51.468 --> 17:53.180
Shit.

18:00.190 --> 18:03.408
Well, you definitely seem like
a toy that a maniac would make.

18:20.277 --> 18:22.914
Don't stab or hook anything.

18:42.210 --> 18:45.320
Do you guys remember where you got
that puppet for James, the, um...

18:45.400 --> 18:49.465
...creepy one with the, uh...
the skull face and the hat?

18:50.445 --> 18:52.467
I don't. Do you?

18:52.547 --> 18:54.860
We didn't actually buy that for James.

18:54.940 --> 18:57.080
He found it when he was at sleepaway camp.

18:57.160 --> 18:59.896
I would never have bought him
something like that.

18:59.976 --> 19:02.381
He really wanted to keep it, so we let him.

19:04.067 --> 19:06.311
Where was his sleepaway camp?

19:07.353 --> 19:08.892
Postville.

19:11.013 --> 19:12.985
You know, this used to be
better before he could fly...

19:13.065 --> 19:15.908
- ...back when he leapt over stuff.
- Why?

19:15.988 --> 19:19.885
Because jumping hundreds of feet
in the air is a logical extrapolation...

19:19.965 --> 19:22.666
...of superhuman strength, right?
Whereas flying...

19:22.746 --> 19:25.852
...displays a flagrant disregard
for the laws of physics, okay?

19:25.932 --> 19:28.842
Unless his body was somehow
magnetically opposed to the Earth...

19:28.922 --> 19:33.233
...or somehow magnetically attracted
to the sun, which is ridiculous.

19:33.313 --> 19:36.400
- He's just too powerful if he can fly.
- Yeah, but he's also bulletproof. So...

19:36.480 --> 19:38.921
- ...what's the difference?
- He's bullet-resistant.

19:44.418 --> 19:46.216
- Hey!
- Hi.

19:46.296 --> 19:47.749
Hi.

19:49.429 --> 19:52.454
- You must be Ashley.
- I am.

19:52.534 --> 19:55.380
- And you're Markowitz?
- Are you impressed?

19:55.460 --> 19:58.346
Just don't even... don't even engage him.
That's the best thing to do. Just...

19:58.426 --> 20:02.354
- Just look over here, so...
- What's this? You going somewhere?

20:02.434 --> 20:05.649
I was actually thinking about going to
that convention at the end of the month.

20:06.229 --> 20:07.764
Cool.

20:08.334 --> 20:10.445
Oh, my God. Do you wanna go?

20:10.525 --> 20:15.327
Mm, to a convention celebrating a bunch of
sick murders that happened 30 years ago?

20:15.407 --> 20:19.456
Things like that exemplify absolutely
everything that's wrong with our society.

20:21.026 --> 20:22.108
- So, that's a yes?
- Yeah.

20:22.188 --> 20:24.395
Oh, cool. Okay. I figured you'd want to.

20:26.475 --> 20:29.517
- You okay there?
- I'm sorry. I just...

20:31.697 --> 20:36.170
...I get this really weird cough
when I'm not invited to things. It's a...

20:36.250 --> 20:38.081
- You wanna come to the convention?
- No.

20:38.161 --> 20:40.679
Oh, my God, I would love
to join you two. Thank you.

20:40.759 --> 20:43.229
That was not an official invitation, okay?

20:43.309 --> 20:45.118
- You gonna un-invite me?
- Mm-hmm.

20:45.198 --> 20:47.656
Your very close friend and tolerant employer?

20:47.736 --> 20:50.580
Okay, if you're gonna come,
just a couple rules. Ready?

20:50.660 --> 20:53.166
There's no eating in the car.
There's no drinking in the car.

20:53.246 --> 20:55.590
There's no smoking in the car.
There's no black metal in the car...

20:55.670 --> 20:57.558
...no thrash metal, no death metal.

20:57.638 --> 21:01.465
- What about... wait, wait, wait...
- No grindcore. And you're paying for gas.

21:01.545 --> 21:04.198
Hold on a second, Genghis McHitler.

21:04.278 --> 21:07.340
You're gonna make me follow all
these rules and then also pay for gas?

21:07.420 --> 21:11.027
These are my terms. They are non-negotiable.
Do you still want to come?

21:11.977 --> 21:15.530
Yes, I do, although now
it's mostly just to spite you.

21:15.890 --> 21:17.733
That's fine.

21:24.433 --> 21:27.699
Hey, Ashley, do you know
any another 7 1/2s...

21:27.779 --> 21:30.912
...that you could maybe... I mean,
I would go as low as, like, a 7...

21:30.992 --> 21:34.873
- ...or a very skilled 6 1/2.
- This is grindcore.

21:35.953 --> 21:39.664
You heard about it
your whole life. This is it.

21:39.744 --> 21:41.971
Very good. Carry on, driver.

21:42.051 --> 21:44.682
- It was your brother's, right... the puppet?
- Yeah, he, uh...

21:44.762 --> 21:48.747
...he found it at sleepaway camp
the summer before his, uh...

21:48.827 --> 21:50.181
...accident.

21:51.234 --> 21:53.269
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to bring up anything sad. I...

21:53.349 --> 21:56.033
No, no. Look, we're...

21:56.713 --> 21:59.208
...we're selling one of James's toys. It's...

21:59.899 --> 22:01.773
...bound to come up.

22:03.725 --> 22:07.039
You know, grindcore
would help us avoid this topic.

22:07.119 --> 22:09.514
Also, uh... I don't know... toplessness?

22:09.594 --> 22:12.309
But you're only an A-cup.

22:12.389 --> 22:14.569
Maybe a B.

22:14.649 --> 22:17.833
Might you try being polite
to you boyfriend's boss, Sugarbat?

22:17.913 --> 22:19.487
Hey.

22:19.967 --> 22:22.176
No nicknames for Blondie here.

22:22.256 --> 22:23.827
Okay?

22:25.424 --> 22:27.296
Fine, Mussolini.

22:52.961 --> 22:55.763
- You wanna...
- Nice.

23:03.954 --> 23:05.768
Enjoy your stay.

23:07.832 --> 23:10.889
Hi. Welcome to the Brass Buckle.

23:10.969 --> 23:13.401
- You here for the convention?
- Yes, we are. Yeah.

23:13.481 --> 23:15.804
Perfect. Uh, what names
are your reservations under?

23:15.884 --> 23:19.530
Uh, there's two. One's under, uh, Easton.
One's under Markowitz.

23:20.715 --> 23:22.611
You must be Markowitz.

23:23.091 --> 23:25.177
Why? 'Cause I look like a Jew?

23:27.243 --> 23:29.905
- Are you Markowitz?
- Yes.

23:29.985 --> 23:32.864
Then there's nothing to be
upset about, now, is there?

23:39.503 --> 23:42.378
All right, here's this.
Please, if you could just... thank you.

23:42.458 --> 23:45.063
- Mm-hmm. Okay.
- Sign right here. Thank you very much.

23:45.143 --> 23:47.427
- Right there. Thank you.
- Okay.

23:52.415 --> 23:55.497
- There's one key, and your second key.
- Okay.

23:55.577 --> 23:58.398
You're all checked in...
102 and the other one.

23:58.478 --> 24:01.443
Um, I'm Howie, if you need anything.

24:02.104 --> 24:06.782
And these pamphlets right here have
the entire convention schedule on them.

24:07.662 --> 24:12.147
Also, there's a coupon to the Toulon
Mansion Tour, if you'd like to go.

24:12.492 --> 24:16.121
- There's one more today at 5:30.
- Thanks, Howie.

24:17.383 --> 24:19.908
Thank you. Enjoy your stay.

24:23.455 --> 24:26.031
- It's good.
- Yeah.

24:34.603 --> 24:36.682
- Let's do this.
- Okay.

24:37.748 --> 24:40.584
Wait. Aren't we meeting
Markowitz in like 10 minutes?

24:40.664 --> 24:42.927
- We'll do it twice, then.
- Mmm.

24:47.983 --> 24:49.570
Twice?

24:59.047 --> 25:02.049
Mmm. Not bad for a comic-book guy.

25:16.134 --> 25:17.977
Remind me your name.

25:20.042 --> 25:21.344
You're an idiot.

25:31.715 --> 25:33.406
I wasn't able to find you a 7 1/2...

25:33.486 --> 25:36.248
- Oh.
- ...or a skilled 6.

25:36.328 --> 25:39.251
But, uh, I appreciate
you sharing Edgar with me.

25:39.331 --> 25:40.949
- I'm happy to.
- Thanks.

25:41.029 --> 25:45.684
Who knows? I might be able to pick up
a rural 7 1/2 in the hotel bar.

25:46.164 --> 25:49.007
It is very depressing in there.
It might give me the edge.

25:49.907 --> 25:54.255
Hey, have you, um... you checked out
Madame Lightning yet, the comic Edgar did?

25:54.335 --> 25:58.912
No. I mean, not yet.
Of course, I will, but, uh...

25:58.992 --> 26:01.520
- You should. It's really good.
- Yeah.

26:01.600 --> 26:04.254
Yeah. I'm sure it's great.

26:07.185 --> 26:09.731
Let's get started, shall we?

26:10.754 --> 26:14.983
My name is Carol Doreski
and I'll be your tour guide this evening.

26:15.063 --> 26:17.345
I'm a retired police officer...

26:17.425 --> 26:21.946
...who was part of the team
that raided this mansion 30 years ago.

26:22.026 --> 26:24.719
Yes, I was one of the shooters.

26:26.683 --> 26:29.311
Andre Toulon... note the pronunciation...

26:29.391 --> 26:31.756
...was born in Paris, France, in 1907.

26:31.836 --> 26:35.655
Not much is known about his life in Europe,
though from a very early age...

26:35.735 --> 26:37.806
...he was involved with the family business.

26:37.886 --> 26:40.824
That was manufacturing, selling...

26:40.904 --> 26:44.352
...and performing with puppets.

26:45.441 --> 26:48.538
We had three of his puppets
in that display case over there...

26:48.618 --> 26:50.467
...before they got stolen.

26:51.490 --> 26:53.469
And this...

26:53.549 --> 26:57.160
...is one of only
two surviving photographs...

26:57.240 --> 27:00.084
...of <i>Les Fantoches Magiques de Toulon.</i>

27:00.164 --> 27:04.054
Translated, that means,
"The Magical French Puppets of Toulon."

27:05.940 --> 27:07.517
Now...

27:07.597 --> 27:10.442
...Andre Toulon was imprisoned in Paris...

27:10.522 --> 27:13.389
...for three years in the late 1920s...

27:13.469 --> 27:17.219
...and twice for shorter durations
in Norway and Luxembourg.

27:17.299 --> 27:19.993
After his third incarceration...

27:20.073 --> 27:22.615
...Toulon moved to Germany...

27:22.695 --> 27:25.618
...where he remained
until shortly after the war.

27:25.698 --> 27:27.707
Somebody fled to Germany?

27:27.787 --> 27:30.999
During his time in the Fatherland, Toulon...

27:31.079 --> 27:33.088
...resumed his puppet show.

27:34.168 --> 27:37.221
Blueprints for this mansion
and bars of gold...

27:37.301 --> 27:40.746
...were sent from Germany
to the Unites States by Toulon...

27:40.826 --> 27:44.141
...as World War II
turned in favor of the Allies.

27:44.221 --> 27:47.198
Four weeks after Germany
surrendered, Toulon...

27:47.278 --> 27:49.451
...along with his wife, Madeline...

27:49.531 --> 27:52.955
...boarded an ocean liner
bound for the United States.

27:53.535 --> 27:56.772
It was during this journey
that Mrs. Toulon...

27:57.352 --> 27:59.417
...jumped from the ship...

27:59.497 --> 28:01.621
...and committed suicide.

28:20.127 --> 28:23.163
The walls of this chamber are soundproof.

28:23.943 --> 28:26.980
On the day that the police
entered the premises...

28:27.840 --> 28:30.458
...these four cots were occupied by women.

28:31.038 --> 28:33.973
Three of them were alive,
but in terrible shape.

28:34.053 --> 28:35.640
Their...

28:38.132 --> 28:40.545
...eyes had been gouged out...

28:40.625 --> 28:43.809
...and their bodies were covered
with burns and lacerations.

28:43.889 --> 28:45.943
All of them were insane.

28:46.923 --> 28:50.731
And the two who were eventually identified...

28:51.936 --> 28:53.781
...were both Jewish.

28:57.760 --> 29:01.437
Note the holes in the middle
of the mattresses and the drain...

29:01.517 --> 29:03.321
...on the floor below them.

29:15.675 --> 29:20.188
It appears the war did not end
in Germany for Andre Toulon.

29:20.268 --> 29:24.459
The swastika in the center
is more than eight feet tall.

29:24.539 --> 29:29.690
Actually, when I grew up in Germany, we
never said "swastika." We said "Hakenkreuz."

29:29.770 --> 29:33.191
You have anything else you wanna add,
since you're the expert?

29:34.238 --> 29:36.704
Is that a... "nein"?

29:39.193 --> 29:41.264
Follow me downstairs.

29:49.407 --> 29:52.822
This is a partial collection...

29:52.902 --> 29:56.339
...of Andre Toulon's extensive library.

29:56.819 --> 30:01.309
In total, the library
has volumes on biology...

30:01.389 --> 30:03.585
...astrology, numerology...

30:03.665 --> 30:06.009
...eschatology, and demonology...

30:06.089 --> 30:09.230
...among other more esoteric subjects.

30:09.310 --> 30:12.755
These were written
in 38 different languages...

30:12.835 --> 30:16.541
...not including the papyrus scrolls
in that case over there...

30:16.621 --> 30:19.705
...which are in two languages
yet to be identified.

30:19.785 --> 30:22.852
Yes, we checked the Internet.

30:22.932 --> 30:24.291
Now...

30:24.371 --> 30:27.987
...I'd like you to pay
close attention to the volumes...

30:28.067 --> 30:31.101
...prominently displayed in the case.

30:32.202 --> 30:35.756
Those are from the private library...

30:35.836 --> 30:37.780
...of Adolf Eichmann.

30:37.860 --> 30:41.110
Eichmann is credited with organizing...

30:41.919 --> 30:43.090
...the "Final Solution."

30:43.170 --> 30:46.051
It sounds like Toulon
deserved worse than what he got.

30:46.956 --> 30:49.183
You're quite right, my friend.

30:58.141 --> 31:01.604
This cellar workshop is where Andre Toulon...

31:01.684 --> 31:05.199
...manufactured puppets
for his mail-order business.

31:05.279 --> 31:07.766
It is unclear how many of these puppets...

31:07.846 --> 31:12.284
...were made and sent around
the United States Europe, and Asia...

31:12.364 --> 31:15.818
...though 60 or so of them
are expected be in Postville...

31:15.898 --> 31:17.713
...by tomorrow for the auction.

31:25.560 --> 31:27.451
This room...

31:27.731 --> 31:29.862
...is where we found Andre Toulon...

31:30.542 --> 31:33.393
...on the day that we forced our way inside.

31:33.916 --> 31:35.620
Toulon...

31:36.200 --> 31:37.909
...raised his gun...

31:37.989 --> 31:39.864
...which was a Luger.

31:42.620 --> 31:44.538
And we shot him...

31:44.618 --> 31:46.444
...four times.

31:48.278 --> 31:51.341
He fell to the ground and died...

31:51.421 --> 31:52.982
...without...

31:53.631 --> 31:55.458
...taking a single shot.

31:57.200 --> 32:00.624
I've often wondered...
maybe he wanted to be executed.

32:03.119 --> 32:05.145
At least, I hope so.

32:17.220 --> 32:23.062
Andre Toulon's body was claimed
by a distant relative and laid to rest...

32:23.142 --> 32:25.234
...in that mausoleum.

32:25.314 --> 32:27.759
What are the rods
coming out of the... the top?

32:27.839 --> 32:31.091
Oh, uh, no one's really sure.

32:31.171 --> 32:35.327
Speculation is that it has
some sort of occult significance.

32:35.407 --> 32:36.812
His library was full of that stuff.

32:36.892 --> 32:39.815
Because they don't go with the rest
of the architecture, you know?

32:39.895 --> 32:41.990
No, I guess they don't.

32:43.246 --> 32:46.343
Well, this is the end of the tour.

32:46.423 --> 32:48.911
Feel free to look around
for a few more minutes...

32:48.991 --> 32:50.739
...and ask me any additional questions.

32:50.819 --> 32:53.084
Cool. Thank you.

32:59.893 --> 33:03.207
- You guys need a jump?
- Thanks, but I already tried that.

33:03.287 --> 33:07.098
- I'm not sure what could be wrong with it.
- Good luck.

33:07.178 --> 33:09.814
Hey, there's one right there. Right there.

33:31.359 --> 33:33.227
Oh. Hi.

33:35.777 --> 33:39.832
Sorry. We probably knocked it over
when we were rushing earlier.

33:44.333 --> 33:46.617
Think somebody who works here took him?

33:47.397 --> 33:51.010
I think that a lot of very valuable
collectibles all arrived in a small town...

33:51.090 --> 33:56.118
...at the same time and I was
a fucking moron to trust a hotel lock.

33:59.278 --> 34:01.382
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Yeah. This is Edgar Easton...

34:01.462 --> 34:03.524
...and I'm in 336. Um...

34:07.453 --> 34:10.043
<i>Rester dans l'ombre.</i>

34:10.801 --> 34:12.320
- <i>Yes?</i>
- Hello?

34:12.400 --> 34:14.650
- Hello? Hello?
- <i>Hello? Hello, sir?</i>

34:14.731 --> 34:18.565
Hi... yes, this is Edgar Easton. Sorry.
There was some interference on the line.

34:18.646 --> 34:22.612
Yeah, I'm... I'm in 336.
Something of mine is, uh, stolen.

34:22.693 --> 34:26.152
- <i>Okay. I'll... I'll see what I can do.</i>
- Okay.

34:29.438 --> 34:32.176
Did that voice say, "Rester dans l'ombre"?

34:32.485 --> 34:34.391
I think so, yes.

34:34.471 --> 34:36.558
Why? What does that mean?

34:36.938 --> 34:38.560
It's French.

34:38.639 --> 34:41.601
It means, "Remain in the shadows."

34:53.158 --> 34:55.277
Something just went under the bed.

34:55.917 --> 34:58.954
Like what? A cockroach? A mouse?

34:59.034 --> 35:00.597
Bigger.

35:09.740 --> 35:12.376
- Jason.
- Yeah?

35:14.615 --> 35:16.462
Our Kaiser's gone.

35:17.555 --> 35:19.443
You know where it is?

35:20.664 --> 35:22.560
Yeah. Hold on a sec.

35:26.543 --> 35:27.910
He's down here.

35:28.150 --> 35:30.377
How'd he get over there?

35:30.457 --> 35:33.112
I don't know. Housekeepers, I guess.

35:35.374 --> 35:38.572
Well, after what we saw today
in the Toulon Mansion...

35:38.652 --> 35:41.110
...I wouldn't have minded if it got stolen.

35:42.556 --> 35:45.010
Having something like that
makes me really uncomfortable.

35:45.090 --> 35:47.436
Lots of Jewish people
collect Nazi memorabilia...

35:47.516 --> 35:50.397
...medals, pamphlets,
posters, stuff like that.

35:50.477 --> 35:52.299
My Uncle Shelley does.

35:54.279 --> 35:56.118
Where'd this guy go?

35:56.744 --> 35:58.296
Huh.

36:00.722 --> 36:04.672
Is it to remind him
of what happened back then?

36:04.752 --> 36:09.565
It's a reminder, sure, but there's also
a feeling of empowerment there, you know?

36:10.845 --> 36:12.419
Like saying to the Nazis...

36:12.499 --> 36:16.216
"...Your big plans of genocide
and world domination didn't work...

36:16.296 --> 36:20.731
...and now your symbols are nothing
more than trinkets for us to collect...

36:20.811 --> 36:23.636
...souvenirs of your failure
and our survival."

37:17.541 --> 37:19.546
Hang it up in the closet.

37:28.662 --> 37:30.166
There.

37:33.188 --> 37:35.679
- You ever worked at a strip club?
- No.

37:35.759 --> 37:37.147
Hmm.

37:37.727 --> 37:38.940
You could.

37:39.020 --> 37:41.077
And that's supposed to be a compliment?

37:50.548 --> 37:53.046
I bet you don't have any tan lines.

37:56.437 --> 37:58.333
I was right.

38:18.160 --> 38:20.821
Fuck! What the fuck are you doing?

38:20.901 --> 38:24.338
- Fuck! What the fuck?
- Shit.

38:25.367 --> 38:27.062
What the fuck?

38:38.369 --> 38:42.460
<i>David Starr starts in Toronto
with the superkick to the face.</i>

38:44.422 --> 38:48.396
- <i>Oh! What elevation on that...</i>
- Kill the bastard son of a bitch!

38:48.476 --> 38:50.788
<i>...nearly jumped out of the building!</i>

38:51.711 --> 38:54.471
- <i>This is lucha libre rules...</i>
- Total bullshit, man!

38:55.831 --> 38:58.114
<i>Although not spent a lot of time in Mexico...</i>

38:58.194 --> 39:01.287
<i>...maybe not super familiar
with lucha libre rules.</i>

39:06.333 --> 39:09.793
<i>David Starr not endearing himself
to this wrestling crowd.</i>

39:46.220 --> 39:48.111
Another beer?

40:12.747 --> 40:14.548
Bartender?

40:15.173 --> 40:17.108
What do you want from the Cuddly Bear?

40:18.305 --> 40:21.380
I want to buy that woman a drink.
What's she having?

40:22.060 --> 40:23.557
Tea.

40:24.137 --> 40:26.616
Need a moment to figure your strategy, cuz?

40:27.196 --> 40:29.806
I'd like to have a tea bag
of whatever she's having.

40:33.594 --> 40:35.633
This will just take a few seconds.

40:35.713 --> 40:37.601
No rush.

40:38.581 --> 40:40.082
Okay.

40:42.068 --> 40:45.879
I would like you to deliver this tea bag
to the bookish blonde over there.

40:45.959 --> 40:47.714
Cuddly Bear can do that.

40:52.034 --> 40:54.265
From the tall gentleman at the end.

41:21.498 --> 41:24.544
- Want another martini?
- Yeah.

41:24.624 --> 41:26.989
Uh, and I think I might order some food, too.

41:27.069 --> 41:30.280
All right. Nerissa, wants to order.

41:31.160 --> 41:35.398
How much would it cost me to, uh, drop
a laxative in the bookish blonde's drink?

41:36.178 --> 41:40.395
- $750.
- That is a very high and specific price.

41:40.475 --> 41:42.727
Cuddly Bear don't wanna hurt nobody...

41:43.402 --> 41:45.408
...even a hater...

41:45.492 --> 41:49.582
...but Mrs. Cuddly Bear
wants herself a new hi-def TV.

41:51.367 --> 41:56.124
Cuddly Bear's got principles,
but he also got priorities.

41:56.533 --> 41:58.947
- Markowitz.
- Cuddly Bear.

41:59.027 --> 42:02.056
Yeah. I heard. Hey, have a drink on me.

42:03.236 --> 42:05.107
Thanks, cuz.

42:11.983 --> 42:15.796
- I'll be right back for your order.
- Thank you. Wait, wait. Wait a second.

42:16.814 --> 42:20.724
- Is that an Empress Asayuki pin?
- You know Empress Asayuki?

42:21.691 --> 42:24.190
I have every manga and DVD.

42:24.270 --> 42:27.350
Well, good to know. I'll be back very soon.

42:31.325 --> 42:33.178
Postville P.D.

42:39.141 --> 42:42.817
Edgar Easton? You're the one that
reported your doll missing, correct?

42:42.897 --> 42:45.467
I did. And it's a puppet.

42:47.070 --> 42:49.779
- Is she with you?
- Yes, she is.

42:49.859 --> 42:52.209
- Name?
- Ashley Summers.

42:52.589 --> 42:55.208
- Your girlfriend?
- Uh...

42:55.288 --> 42:57.005
...we're dating. Right?

42:57.085 --> 42:58.372
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

42:58.452 --> 43:01.345
Did she know about the doll,
what it was worth?

43:02.425 --> 43:06.319
She did. Uh, I don't understand
what that has to do with anything.

43:06.399 --> 43:08.917
When did you first tell her about the doll?

43:08.997 --> 43:10.571
I don't understand
what that has to do with it.

43:10.651 --> 43:13.500
You don't have to understand. Just tell me,
when did you first tell her about the doll?

43:13.580 --> 43:15.184
I don't know.
A little over a week ago, maybe.

43:15.264 --> 43:18.461
Was that before or after
you two first had intercourse?

43:18.541 --> 43:20.807
- None of your business.
- No, it's my business because...

43:20.887 --> 43:23.838
Edgar told me about the puppet
exactly one week after...

43:23.918 --> 43:26.440
...we'd had intercourse for the first time.

43:26.520 --> 43:30.558
We did it 3 more times that day
and approximately 11 more times...

43:30.638 --> 43:32.389
...the following week.

43:33.369 --> 43:36.205
Need any other stats, Gramps?

43:36.285 --> 43:38.525
No, you told me more than plenty.

43:38.605 --> 43:40.962
Now, when did you first notice
your doll missing?

43:41.042 --> 43:44.561
Please don't say, "Doll." And if you saw it,
I swear you would never say "doll."

43:44.641 --> 43:47.863
It's a doll. It's a doll. Ma'am?

43:48.371 --> 43:51.299
Ma'am, Postville P.D. Do you speak English?

43:51.379 --> 43:55.272
- Yeah, I do. Of course. Yeah.
- So, what's all the commotion?

43:55.352 --> 43:59.381
- Well, someone stole <i>mein</i> puppets.
- How many puppets do you have?

43:59.461 --> 44:02.832
Five of them.
And two were in near-mint condition.

44:02.912 --> 44:04.921
Five puppets?

44:08.657 --> 44:11.931
This incident is starting
to turn into a happening.

44:12.577 --> 44:16.990
Mom, just want to take some
time and re-evaluate things...

44:17.070 --> 44:19.871
...you know, not rush into
anything like I did last time.

44:21.583 --> 44:25.442
Yeah, and the gallery is taking up
plenty of my attention now.

44:27.589 --> 44:31.278
No, not once since New Year's...

44:31.682 --> 44:33.659
...not even a little sip.

44:37.177 --> 44:40.701
Thanks. It was hard at first, but, uh...

44:40.781 --> 44:42.804
...now I don't even miss it.

44:44.144 --> 44:46.629
Yeah, except maybe a little bit at openings.

44:53.658 --> 44:55.956
Yeah, well, we'll see.

44:56.370 --> 45:00.312
There's at least eight others
that are up for auction, and...

45:00.392 --> 45:02.946
...the condition of mine... you know...

45:03.426 --> 45:05.227
...it isn't the best.

45:09.073 --> 45:11.626
I'm hoping to get like $3,000 for it...

45:12.258 --> 45:14.208
...maybe $2,000.

45:14.288 --> 45:18.989
Okay. Yeah. Go enjoy your bridge game.
Say hi to Betty for me. Bye, Mom.

45:19.069 --> 45:20.962
Bye, Mom.

46:32.709 --> 46:35.001
<i>Okay, here it comes. Yes, Jonathan...</i>

46:40.495 --> 46:43.568
Anne? Was that you?

46:51.269 --> 46:53.336
Anne, you making that noise?

46:59.988 --> 47:02.410
Hey. You fall asleep, babe?

47:05.320 --> 47:06.829
Anne!

47:11.883 --> 47:14.362
What the fuck? Babe!

47:15.612 --> 47:19.054
Oh, fuck! Fuck! What... babe!

47:31.589 --> 47:33.978
What the fuck happened to you?

49:14.209 --> 49:16.478
Hey, wanna go to a strip club?

49:19.797 --> 49:22.348
- You're a genius.
- Totally.

49:22.428 --> 49:24.630
You're a genius.

49:32.515 --> 49:35.786
You already forgot about
the strip club, didn't you?

49:35.866 --> 49:38.405
No, man. No, I didn't forget.

49:41.441 --> 49:43.280
You see those things?

49:47.983 --> 49:49.513
What things?

49:49.593 --> 49:52.224
The three little guys
that just ran under the van.

49:56.108 --> 49:58.767
That sounds "doobie-ous."

49:59.897 --> 50:03.192
Howie, I'm gonna need the first and last
name of every guest in the hotel, okay?

50:03.272 --> 50:04.794
Okay.

50:05.274 --> 50:07.773
What are you looking so nervous about?

50:08.508 --> 50:10.782
The police make me nervous.

50:11.202 --> 50:13.057
Where were you...

50:15.937 --> 50:17.489
Brown.

50:18.769 --> 50:20.574
What?

50:20.654 --> 50:22.903
That's unbelievable. Where?

50:24.106 --> 50:26.670
All right. I'm on my way
with the hotel manager.

50:33.171 --> 50:35.455
- What's that?
- What's going on?

50:35.957 --> 50:39.189
Uh, just, um... there's...

50:39.600 --> 50:41.492
Oh, my God.

50:44.692 --> 50:46.235
Hello?

50:46.315 --> 50:49.932
Huh? What? Both of them? The Gottliebs?

50:50.724 --> 50:54.418
Ah. I'll... I'll tell the police.

50:54.554 --> 50:58.841
Just keep the door shut
and don't touch anything, okay?

51:02.810 --> 51:04.906
Detective Brown, uh...

51:04.986 --> 51:09.513
...two more bodies
were found by housekeeping.

51:10.600 --> 51:14.267
- We should leave. We really... yeah. Okay.
- Yeah, we should go. Get your stuff.

51:15.270 --> 51:17.984
Hold on a sec. What is that?

51:18.064 --> 51:19.063
- Edgar...
- I just... I...

51:19.143 --> 51:21.432
- Wait right there.
- I wouldn't, um...

51:22.712 --> 51:24.747
...go in there.

51:41.570 --> 51:44.797
<i>And a dip lock! He's so strong.</i>

51:46.244 --> 51:48.254
<i>Has he flipped anybody as big as Moose?</i>

51:48.334 --> 51:50.446
Hey, Howie!

51:50.526 --> 51:52.628
There's a lot of blood down here!

51:55.036 --> 51:58.916
Uh, Dete... Detective Brown? Detective Brown?

51:58.996 --> 52:01.605
We need you out here, please. This is...

52:03.044 --> 52:06.914
- What now?
- I don't know. Just come this way.

52:10.020 --> 52:13.762
- Who's staying in this room?
- Hezekiah Buckland.

52:14.142 --> 52:15.790
Hezekiah?

52:34.075 --> 52:36.405
Hezekiah Buckland...
what kind of name is that?

52:36.485 --> 52:38.300
It's a gypsy name.

52:38.739 --> 52:40.581
I Googled it.

52:40.908 --> 52:42.960
These are hate crimes, Detective.

52:43.040 --> 52:46.657
A gypsy, a lesbian, and a Jewish couple
have all been murdered.

52:46.737 --> 52:50.620
Please let me do my job, all right?
This is my job.

52:51.222 --> 52:53.580
Howie, I want every guest
in the hotel downstairs...

52:53.660 --> 52:57.610
...in the lobby of the convention center
right now. Attendance is mandatory.

52:57.690 --> 53:00.195
- Yeah.
- If they're not dead, they're suspects.

53:00.275 --> 53:03.851
Walker, you know the drill.
Tape off the room. Nobody gets in.

53:03.931 --> 53:05.983
Come on, Howie. Let's go.

53:07.163 --> 53:10.192
- Edgar, what's happening?
- Hi. Um, we're gonna text Markowitz...

53:10.272 --> 53:11.946
- ...and see if he's okay.
- Okay.

53:12.026 --> 53:15.689
- Have you ever been to Dallas before?
- Um, twice.

53:15.769 --> 53:18.213
I liked it there,
but it was pretty expensive.

53:18.293 --> 53:21.824
Well, not if you know
the right spots to hit and, um...

53:21.904 --> 53:23.991
...have a place to stay.

53:27.881 --> 53:30.586
- You didn't hide it from me.
- What?

53:30.666 --> 53:33.284
Your password. Most people hide it from me.

53:33.364 --> 53:35.230
Uh, my last boyfriend did.

53:35.310 --> 53:38.007
Well... I trust you.

53:38.487 --> 53:42.907
And, plus, Empress Asayuki
is a woman of honor, is she not?

53:43.449 --> 53:46.145
Yeah. Yeah, she is.

53:47.422 --> 53:49.488
No, no.

53:50.586 --> 53:54.290
Okay. I got to tell you,
this is just technically fan fiction...

53:54.370 --> 53:58.832
...but I prefer it significantly to, like,
the last two or three theatrical releases.

53:58.912 --> 54:00.462
Here.

54:02.598 --> 54:05.017
- That's cool.
- Yeah.

54:12.565 --> 54:16.036
- You're selling one at the auction?
- One what?

54:17.938 --> 54:21.058
That's not mine. Actually,
I don't really know how that got here.

54:21.138 --> 54:23.343
Mm. Maybe it walked.

54:29.181 --> 54:30.694
Huh.

54:32.161 --> 54:34.991
Looks like somebody
ripped off one of his arms.

54:36.066 --> 54:38.879
This one doesn't have any hair, either.
I don't think this Edgar's.

54:48.196 --> 54:49.883
This is the police department!

54:49.963 --> 54:53.848
Every single person is required
to go down to the lobby right now!

54:54.228 --> 54:56.237
This is an emergency!

54:56.317 --> 54:58.400
Everybody go downstairs!

54:58.480 --> 55:00.022
Okay.

55:13.713 --> 55:16.708
Everybody go downstairs right now!

55:19.370 --> 55:22.511
Oh, uh, snag a jacket, love.
Who knows how long this will take?

55:22.591 --> 55:24.650
I thought you gonna keep me warm.

55:26.826 --> 55:28.611
Don't stall.

55:35.648 --> 55:37.304
This one?

55:38.389 --> 55:40.222
Hurry, love.

56:25.491 --> 56:27.956
- I'm gonna text him again.
- Okay.

56:28.036 --> 56:30.280
Actually, no. Wait. Look.

56:31.660 --> 56:33.974
- Hey. Markowitz, hey.
- Finally.

56:34.054 --> 56:35.909
Hey, I'm glad you're okay.

56:36.869 --> 56:41.623
<i>Uh, hi. Sorry. Uh... is everybody...
can everybody hear me?</i>

56:41.703 --> 56:44.133
Fuckin' cop's looking right at me.
We should fuckin' leave.

56:44.213 --> 56:47.061
<i>This is Detective Brown
from the Postville Police Department.</i>

56:47.141 --> 56:51.596
<i>He's going to explain what's happening
here. Um... Detective Brown?</i>

56:52.476 --> 56:55.604
Okay. Now, as many of you already know...

56:55.684 --> 57:00.217
...there's been multiple cases of theft and
murder at the Brass Buckle this evening.

57:00.297 --> 57:02.742
The police department is here
to investigate those crimes...

57:02.822 --> 57:07.385
...and we're gonna have to interview each and
every one of you before the night is over.

57:07.465 --> 57:10.788
- We'd like to prioritize anyone who...
- Detective, do you think it's safe for us...

57:10.868 --> 57:15.276
- ...to be here, given the circumstances?
- Hold all questions until I'm through.

57:15.356 --> 57:18.845
No one's leaving the building unless
authorized by the police department...

57:18.925 --> 57:22.228
...and that's not going to happen
in the near future, so...

57:23.943 --> 57:25.947
- What?
- What?

57:27.616 --> 57:30.705
- You got backup power?
- Yeah, we should.

57:30.785 --> 57:33.599
Okay, now, in the event of a power failure...

57:33.679 --> 57:36.893
...the backup generator will kick in,
so we won't be left in the dark.

57:36.973 --> 57:41.054
Now, does anybody think he
or she may have seen something...

57:46.940 --> 57:50.150
It isn't safe for us to stay here. I mean,
there have been murders and thefts and...

57:50.230 --> 57:54.750
No one is leaving this building until the
police have completed their investigation.

57:54.830 --> 57:57.821
Get the doors. And from now on...

57:57.901 --> 58:01.762
...anyone who interrupts me
will be charged with obstruction.

58:03.796 --> 58:05.500
You can't lock us in.

58:06.245 --> 58:10.113
Stay where you are!
Do not attempt to leave the building!

58:10.193 --> 58:11.926
Run!

58:13.166 --> 58:14.744
Stop!

58:15.024 --> 58:17.073
Doreski, stand down!

58:33.707 --> 58:35.590
Come on.

59:12.816 --> 59:16.310
Hey! Travis! Open the door! Travis!

59:19.329 --> 59:21.089
- What are you doing?
- I'm trying to start...

59:21.169 --> 59:23.990
- Start the fucking car!
- It's not working!

59:24.933 --> 59:26.416
What the fuck?

59:27.180 --> 59:29.018
Oh, my God!

59:29.098 --> 59:30.628
No!

59:40.095 --> 59:42.162
Now I know what killed my brother.

01:00:01.461 --> 01:00:04.044
Kid! Come on!

01:00:04.124 --> 01:00:06.970
Come on! We got to go in.

01:00:08.729 --> 01:00:10.536
Stay behind the Cuddly Bear.

01:00:11.384 --> 01:00:13.425
Hold on to my silk tight.

01:00:28.383 --> 01:00:29.885
Kid!

01:00:35.894 --> 01:00:39.306
- These doors are staying shut.
- Everyone, come on.

01:00:39.386 --> 01:00:42.788
Let's regroup in here. We got to make a plan.

01:00:42.868 --> 01:00:45.360
I think we can defend ourselves
better in the Easy Comfort.

01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:48.842
Fine. Let's regroup
in the Easy Comfort, then.

01:00:50.005 --> 01:00:52.341
Stick with him. I have to get something.

01:01:01.669 --> 01:01:04.702
Everybody should take one of these
so we know what we're up against.

01:01:11.070 --> 01:01:14.695
You're saying a puppet killed
little cuz, a goddamn toy?

01:01:14.775 --> 01:01:18.388
I know it sounds insane, but we all
saw what we saw in the parking lot.

01:01:18.468 --> 01:01:20.564
Some of us did more
than just see these things.

01:01:20.644 --> 01:01:23.524
- This is crazy.
- We've called for police assistance...

01:01:23.604 --> 01:01:28.028
...the two nearest towns, but they're not
gonna be here for at least two hours.

01:01:28.108 --> 01:01:31.864
- Two hours?
- Fuck. Double fuck.

01:01:31.944 --> 01:01:36.132
Right. So we're gonna have to figure out
a way to defend ourselves right now.

01:01:36.212 --> 01:01:38.931
Anybody have any idea
how this is happening...

01:01:39.011 --> 01:01:42.012
...how these puppets
are doing what they're doing?

01:01:42.492 --> 01:01:43.987
All right.

01:01:44.067 --> 01:01:47.200
Then we catch one
and figure out how it works.

01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:50.595
You and your blue buddies seem to be
the only ones with the guns.

01:01:50.675 --> 01:01:52.814
Yeah, and that's a good thing...

01:01:52.894 --> 01:01:56.906
...considering the terrible judgment
some of you have exercised so far.

01:01:57.986 --> 01:02:01.055
So, we catch one, we take it apart,
we figure out how it works...

01:02:01.135 --> 01:02:03.984
...how to stop it, how to kill it.

01:02:04.645 --> 01:02:07.263
Any idea as to how many there might be?

01:02:07.343 --> 01:02:12.886
63 were to be auctioned off
tomorrow, so maybe 40, 45?

01:02:12.966 --> 01:02:15.425
- Biscuits!
- Okay.

01:02:15.505 --> 01:02:18.574
The next logical question is, "Why?"

01:02:18.654 --> 01:02:20.798
Because they're Nazis.

01:02:21.878 --> 01:02:25.615
Think about it. They've targeted
a Jewish couple, a gay woman...

01:02:25.695 --> 01:02:28.280
...a gypsy, and they were made by
a guy who worked for the Third Reich.

01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:29.915
I don't think that's a coincidence.

01:02:29.995 --> 01:02:32.552
They were attacking pretty
indiscriminately in the parking lot.

01:02:32.632 --> 01:02:34.969
Okay, that's different.
That's when people were trying to flee...

01:02:35.049 --> 01:02:37.573
...and they were fighting back
so they were just pissed.

01:02:37.653 --> 01:02:40.901
- Why would a guy like "Too-lon"...
- It's "Toulon."

01:02:40.981 --> 01:02:45.140
Why would anybody create a Nazi puppet?

01:02:45.420 --> 01:02:48.234
Because a puppet would be a very good spy.

01:02:48.954 --> 01:02:53.238
They're little. They're fast.
They can go around unnoticed...

01:02:53.318 --> 01:02:56.077
...find undesirables, okay?
If Anne Frank was hiding in your attic...

01:02:56.157 --> 01:02:59.646
- ...a puppet could find her.
- What do you mean, like a bloodhound?

01:02:59.726 --> 01:03:04.085
Exactly, except one that you would
give to a kid for their birthday.

01:03:04.165 --> 01:03:06.572
What exactly do you do, Mr. Easton?

01:03:08.604 --> 01:03:10.692
I write and draw comic books.

01:03:11.772 --> 01:03:14.008
And that makes you an authority on this?

01:03:14.788 --> 01:03:17.032
- Nazi puppets?
- I have an imagination.

01:03:18.092 --> 01:03:21.537
I also have an asshole cop for a father,
so this whole bit doesn't intimidate me.

01:03:21.617 --> 01:03:25.150
Why now? Why here, Mr... Mr. Comic Book?

01:03:25.230 --> 01:03:27.522
I don't know. I don't know.

01:03:29.016 --> 01:03:31.882
But I happen to think that you're right.
We have to catch one...

01:03:31.962 --> 01:03:33.910
...take it apart.

01:03:33.990 --> 01:03:35.403
I'll do it.

01:03:36.205 --> 01:03:39.089
My great-grandfather,
he had the numbers on his arm.

01:03:39.169 --> 01:03:41.444
The stories that he told us, uh...

01:03:43.522 --> 01:03:46.719
If these Nazi puppets want a Jew,
then I'll be the bait, okay?

01:03:46.799 --> 01:03:49.565
But you got to promise me that after
we find out what we need to know...

01:03:49.645 --> 01:03:51.738
...that you will let me kill the fucker.

01:03:56.173 --> 01:03:57.994
You have a plan?

01:04:02.819 --> 01:04:05.204
You got a menorah in storage?

01:05:20.140 --> 01:05:21.950
Markowitz, stay back.

01:05:57.669 --> 01:05:59.839
Fuck! Ahh!

01:05:59.919 --> 01:06:02.444
Come on, kid. Go! Out!

01:06:02.524 --> 01:06:04.425
Grab that puppet!

01:06:20.087 --> 01:06:23.240
- Okay. This one's called Mechaniker.
- Yeah. That's German for "mechanic."

01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:25.330
Thank you.
I think we could've figured that out.

01:06:25.410 --> 01:06:28.852
This purple thing... what is this,
a hard drive, a motor?

01:06:29.152 --> 01:06:30.993
What the hell activated it?

01:06:32.373 --> 01:06:35.602
- Maybe it's something local.
- Like what?

01:06:57.745 --> 01:06:59.289
Shit.

01:06:59.369 --> 01:07:01.441
It's Junior Fuerher.

01:07:04.884 --> 01:07:08.143
- All right, all right, all right, all right.
- Kill that fucking baby!

01:07:17.649 --> 01:07:20.297
- Nice shot.
- Thanks.

01:07:20.377 --> 01:07:22.852
- I think he's dead.
- Yeah.

01:07:23.432 --> 01:07:25.325
Give me that fucking thing.

01:07:41.020 --> 01:07:42.899
Let's see how you like it.

01:08:03.856 --> 01:08:05.708
Get behind me.

01:08:07.288 --> 01:08:09.503
I got a first-aid kid in the office.

01:08:44.344 --> 01:08:48.076
Yeah, come out of there.
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

01:08:51.817 --> 01:08:55.822
- We got to hide somewhere else.
- Okay, everyone, go up to a room...

01:08:55.902 --> 01:08:59.527
...or an office.
Seal it up till help comes...

01:08:59.707 --> 01:09:02.008
...'cause what happened
in that parking lot...

01:09:02.087 --> 01:09:04.078
...is about to happen in here.

01:09:04.158 --> 01:09:05.974
Let's go.

01:09:17.116 --> 01:09:18.984
- Okay, wait here.
- No, no, I'm armed. I should...

01:09:19.064 --> 01:09:20.961
- No, no, no, no. I'll go first.
- Take this.

01:09:21.041 --> 01:09:23.312
Get... get back.

01:09:27.679 --> 01:09:29.609
Oh, shit.

01:09:59.580 --> 01:10:01.451
Check everywhere.

01:10:10.932 --> 01:10:13.804
Nothing. There's nothing.

01:10:22.004 --> 01:10:23.510
Hello?

01:10:25.893 --> 01:10:27.697
Someone help me?

01:10:28.304 --> 01:10:30.283
Shouldn't we help her?

01:10:30.363 --> 01:10:33.745
I just think that going outside
right now is not a good idea.

01:10:35.094 --> 01:10:37.495
So we're just gonna let her die?

01:10:38.575 --> 01:10:42.817
There's a pretty big pile of dead people
right outside of that door right now, okay?

01:10:42.897 --> 01:10:45.881
If the puppets find out
where we are, it's over.

01:10:50.391 --> 01:10:51.826
What is she saying?

01:10:51.906 --> 01:10:53.879
She's saying the Shema...

01:10:53.959 --> 01:10:57.637
...which is the prayer
that Jews say before they die.

01:11:00.045 --> 01:11:04.105
Goddamn these fucks, these fucking Nazis.

01:11:05.877 --> 01:11:09.323
- All right, that's it. Give me the gun.
- You can't go out there.

01:11:09.403 --> 01:11:13.686
No. What I can't do is just sit here
and let this happen to us again.

01:11:14.176 --> 01:11:16.925
You changed your mind because she's Jewish?

01:11:17.005 --> 01:11:19.637
- Yep.
- Why?

01:11:20.717 --> 01:11:23.024
I got about six million reasons why.

01:11:27.223 --> 01:11:31.407
I'm not gonna fight you on this one, all
right? I'm going out there, armed or not.

01:11:32.312 --> 01:11:33.882
Hey.

01:11:34.862 --> 01:11:37.098
- Let's do this.
- What?

01:11:39.724 --> 01:11:43.806
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Take this. Just... just take it.

01:11:45.438 --> 01:11:47.869
- Thank you.
- Edgar.

01:11:47.949 --> 01:11:49.532
Hey...

01:11:50.212 --> 01:11:51.841
...don't shoot Markowitz, okay?

01:11:52.911 --> 01:11:54.415
Sorry.

01:13:02.994 --> 01:13:05.007
Oh! Fuck it!

01:13:09.027 --> 01:13:11.614
Guys? Guys?

01:13:12.207 --> 01:13:13.708
Guys?

01:13:37.450 --> 01:13:39.646
- Oh, my God.
- All right.

01:13:39.726 --> 01:13:42.531
Yep. Got you.

01:13:48.765 --> 01:13:50.676
All right.

01:13:51.956 --> 01:13:55.173
- It's about time I woke up from this dream.
- Yeah. We all should.

01:13:55.633 --> 01:13:57.458
What about the woman?

01:14:00.159 --> 01:14:01.997
We were too late.

01:14:08.372 --> 01:14:10.090
No!

01:14:10.670 --> 01:14:11.925
Gun!

01:14:18.707 --> 01:14:20.746
Oh, buddy, buddy, buddy.

01:14:23.016 --> 01:14:26.241
Open the window and jump down.

01:14:29.415 --> 01:14:31.668
Dedicate your next comic to me...

01:14:32.548 --> 01:14:34.797
...to a great...

01:14:35.277 --> 01:14:37.384
...Jewish hero.

01:14:43.951 --> 01:14:45.412
<i>Shalom,</i> amigo.

01:14:47.492 --> 01:14:49.070
Goodbye.

01:14:56.772 --> 01:14:58.405
Nerissa...

01:14:59.392 --> 01:15:02.962
...do you think you would have slept with me?

01:15:03.492 --> 01:15:05.700
You know, if I'd, like...

01:15:05.780 --> 01:15:08.583
...took you to some
nice restaurants and didn't...

01:15:08.663 --> 01:15:12.273
...say anything too stupid?

01:15:13.198 --> 01:15:15.355
60% chance.

01:15:15.735 --> 01:15:17.627
That's good to know.

01:15:26.297 --> 01:15:30.078
We need to jump. It's our best option,
unless you think we should go up.

01:15:40.812 --> 01:15:42.675
I'm sorry.

01:15:56.297 --> 01:16:00.168
Nerissa, we gotta go! Come on! Come on!

01:16:13.540 --> 01:16:15.565
- Check for keys.
- Okay.

01:16:29.852 --> 01:16:32.440
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry, man.

01:16:35.876 --> 01:16:38.508
Are we just gonna leave everyone back there?

01:16:39.588 --> 01:16:42.468
- I think I have an idea how we can help them.
- Toulon's Mansion?

01:16:42.548 --> 01:16:46.089
My guess is that's what switches them on,
maybe even controls them.

01:16:46.169 --> 01:16:48.238
I hope you're right.

01:18:03.903 --> 01:18:07.187
- It's me they want.
- Why do they want you, Howie?

01:18:07.267 --> 01:18:09.534
Because I'm...

01:18:11.014 --> 01:18:13.825
- I'll go in. I'll go in. I'll go in.
- Howie, no! Howie!

01:18:13.905 --> 01:18:17.730
Howie! You're no hero, so don't even try it.

01:18:22.487 --> 01:18:24.713
Now, don't get the sniffles.

01:18:24.793 --> 01:18:27.660
Your Cuddly Bear helped
kill some puppet niggas...

01:18:27.740 --> 01:18:30.201
...and can handle hisself just fine.

01:18:31.583 --> 01:18:34.319
Just do what I asked you
to do until I get home.

01:18:34.399 --> 01:18:37.079
<i>Okay. I'll take a bubble bath.</i>

01:18:40.500 --> 01:18:43.606
That'll give Cuddly Bear
something real nice to think about.

01:18:46.685 --> 01:18:49.029
Now go get yourself effervescent.

01:18:49.109 --> 01:18:50.992
<i>I will.</i>

01:18:51.072 --> 01:18:53.544
- Bye, Lady Bear.
- <i>Bye.</i>

01:18:56.708 --> 01:18:58.554
Oh, shit.

01:19:23.025 --> 01:19:26.229
- What?
- Oh, my God. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

01:19:26.825 --> 01:19:28.630
It's okay.

01:19:29.410 --> 01:19:33.304
- That was really brave back there.
- That was really brave of you, too.

01:19:33.384 --> 01:19:35.398
Not bad for a comic-book guy, right?

01:19:41.593 --> 01:19:44.528
So, I've been meaning to say
something to you for a while.

01:19:44.608 --> 01:19:46.280
I just want to explain
why I didn't read those comics...

01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:49.015
You don't have to explain that.
It doesn't matter. It...

01:19:49.095 --> 01:19:51.992
Madame Lightning's based
on your ex-wife, isn't she?

01:19:53.969 --> 01:19:55.695
Yeah.

01:19:55.775 --> 01:19:57.128
Well...

01:19:57.208 --> 01:19:59.091
...the thing is...

01:20:01.660 --> 01:20:03.469
...I like you...

01:20:04.149 --> 01:20:05.985
...a lot.

01:20:06.665 --> 01:20:09.818
And those drawings felt like love letters
written to somebody else, and...

01:20:10.321 --> 01:20:11.855
...yeah.

01:20:13.598 --> 01:20:16.478
- It was that obvious?
- Yeah. It was to me.

01:20:17.558 --> 01:20:20.380
You don't have to be jealous, um...

01:20:21.649 --> 01:20:23.902
...'cause the truth is...

01:20:23.982 --> 01:20:26.357
...I'm falling in love you,
and I only didn't tell you...

01:20:26.437 --> 01:20:29.448
...because I thought
it would freak you out. So...

01:20:29.754 --> 01:20:31.329
...there.

01:20:34.096 --> 01:20:35.615
Edgar.

01:20:41.552 --> 01:20:44.479
Let me drive. Let me drive. Let me drive.

01:20:44.559 --> 01:20:47.160
Did you just say... I heard that you love me?

01:20:47.240 --> 01:20:49.118
Is that correct?

01:20:49.198 --> 01:20:51.286
- Yes.
- Yes.

01:20:53.307 --> 01:20:55.255
I just wish I could remember your name.

01:20:55.335 --> 01:20:56.888
Again.

01:20:57.468 --> 01:20:58.933
Okay.

01:20:59.513 --> 01:21:01.048
We're here.

01:21:01.128 --> 01:21:04.095
- Remember that creepy old building?
- Yeah. The mausoleum.

01:21:10.054 --> 01:21:11.865
Put on your seatbelt.

01:21:14.184 --> 01:21:16.063
- You have a plan, right?
- I do...

01:21:16.143 --> 01:21:19.725
...but I can't tell you the whole plan
because I think...

01:21:20.905 --> 01:21:23.951
- ...you will probably panic.
- Panic? Why?

01:21:44.005 --> 01:21:46.446
Looks like the nigga's out of juice.

01:21:52.753 --> 01:21:54.768
Bitch-ass puppet.

01:22:03.055 --> 01:22:04.577
Howie?

01:22:08.639 --> 01:22:10.204
Howie?

01:22:15.924 --> 01:22:17.960
Aw, shit, kid.

01:22:26.117 --> 01:22:27.947
Oh, shit.

01:22:28.591 --> 01:22:31.078
It's okay. Just try again.

01:23:33.980 --> 01:23:38.859
Oh, my God. You okay? You okay?
You okay? Oh, my God.

01:23:42.393 --> 01:23:44.629
- Was that Andre Toulon?
- I don't know. I think so, yeah.

01:23:44.709 --> 01:23:46.259
Okay.

01:24:02.361 --> 01:24:04.366
No!

01:24:49.904 --> 01:24:52.131
I wanted to tell you that I think
the new Madame Lightning's...

01:24:52.211 --> 01:24:55.230
- ...even better than the first one.
- I agree.

01:24:58.160 --> 01:25:00.839
And, man, this issue's really messed up.

01:25:01.568 --> 01:25:04.709
Lots of terrible shit happens
to people who don't deserve it.

01:25:04.789 --> 01:25:06.400
Yeah.

01:25:06.797 --> 01:25:10.661
I, uh... I try to mirror
reality in my work, so...

01:25:16.540 --> 01:25:18.557
Are you gonna do some more?
