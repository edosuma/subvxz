WEBVTT

00:03.840 --> 00:05.990
Hey, pass me the chips.

00:06.440 --> 00:08.715
Sure. Go long.

00:08.920 --> 00:11.275
- Three eighty-five. Hut, hut.
- Face left.

00:11.480 --> 00:14.233
Face left. One, two, three.
He goes for the Hail Mary.

00:19.400 --> 00:23.109
- Al? Al, are you all right?
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

00:24.400 --> 00:26.675
Come on, buddy.
The NFL draft is on.

00:26.880 --> 00:29.314
Let's go, let's go.

00:29.520 --> 00:31.715
<i>In the first round,
the San Francisco 49ers...</i>

00:31.920 --> 00:34.912
<i>...select Jamal Sanders
from Texas A&M.</i>

00:35.120 --> 00:37.111
Oh, man, look at that.
That could've been me.

00:38.400 --> 00:42.188
I guess we'll never know because
you only played high school ball.

00:42.400 --> 00:45.119
Hey, at least
I was man enough to suit up for it.

00:45.320 --> 00:48.153
Hey, I suited up,
and I played at every game.

00:48.360 --> 00:51.318
You were in the band.

00:51.520 --> 00:54.318
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.
And more than once, I played hurt.

00:54.520 --> 00:57.830
You know, the glockenspiel
is a cruel mistress.

00:59.280 --> 01:02.431
Al. Honey, you broke the-

01:03.640 --> 01:05.471
The flat thing.

01:06.800 --> 01:08.392
It's the dinner table, Peg.

01:08.600 --> 01:11.398
You know, as in cooking dinner
and serving it to your family.

01:12.760 --> 01:16.548
Well, in that case,
thanks for getting rid of it, honey.

01:17.240 --> 01:19.879
Man, what I wouldn't give to play
for the Chicago Bears.

01:20.080 --> 01:23.356
I would sell my soul
to play for the Bears.

01:28.120 --> 01:29.348
Good afternoon.

01:31.760 --> 01:33.591
I'm here to fix your television.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.479
Nothing wrong with my television.

01:41.400 --> 01:44.312
You know, my wife needs
some fixing too.

01:46.000 --> 01:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:22.120 --> 02:26.159
If you're a repairman,
where's your butt crack?

02:27.080 --> 02:28.752
My tail's covering it.

02:29.080 --> 02:31.310
I'm Lucifer.

02:32.720 --> 02:34.438
Peg, one of your relatives.

02:37.600 --> 02:39.113
Peg?

02:39.840 --> 02:41.034
Jefferson?

02:41.240 --> 02:44.312
They can't hear you.
I've frozen them.

02:44.520 --> 02:46.909
Hey, these are two
of the laziest people on Earth.

02:47.120 --> 02:50.112
You want to impress me?
Make them get jobs.

02:50.520 --> 02:53.239
I'm the devil, not a genie.

02:55.800 --> 02:59.679
I still don't think
he's seeing my point.

02:59.880 --> 03:02.235
Maybe this will help.

03:07.160 --> 03:09.310
Oh, so you're the devil.

03:11.840 --> 03:12.795
What do you want?

03:13.320 --> 03:15.356
Your soul, Mr. Bundy.

03:16.800 --> 03:18.233
Deal.

03:19.200 --> 03:22.397
Gee, Tom Arnold put up
more of a fight.

03:22.800 --> 03:24.870
Okay. So you can have my soul...

03:25.080 --> 03:27.071
...but I get to play
for the Chicago Bears...

03:27.280 --> 03:29.475
...and take them to a Super Bowl.

03:34.360 --> 03:37.557
Before I go, I'd better unfreeze them.

03:37.800 --> 03:39.711
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

03:53.800 --> 03:55.279
Go ahead.

03:59.200 --> 04:01.191
Oh, Jesus.

04:04.240 --> 04:05.958
Is something burning?

04:06.160 --> 04:08.310
Has Mom been ironing?

04:08.520 --> 04:10.590
No, nothing as unusual as that.

04:10.840 --> 04:14.071
I sold my soul to the devil.

04:14.280 --> 04:16.999
Cool. For riches and diamonds?

04:17.200 --> 04:20.589
Kelly, we're talking about Dad's soul.

04:20.800 --> 04:22.870
For a Canadian penny?

04:24.040 --> 04:24.995
No, pumpkin.

04:25.200 --> 04:29.352
Daddy's gonna be the new star fullback
for the Chicago Bears.

04:29.880 --> 04:35.750
<i>Right. And I sold my soul so I could
be a Sports Illustrated swimsuit model.</i>

04:35.960 --> 04:39.839
You'd have to sell every soul
in China for that, Peg.

04:40.520 --> 04:42.750
<i>Guys, look. Daddy's on TV.</i>

04:42.960 --> 04:44.188
<i>And in the first round...</i>

04:44.400 --> 04:47.949
<i>...the Chicago Bears select,
from James K. Polk High School...</i>

04:48.160 --> 04:49.752
<i>...Al Bundy.</i>

04:55.720 --> 04:57.836
Hey, guys, I hope you're not
still mad at me...

04:58.040 --> 04:59.837
...for making you look bad
at practice.

05:00.040 --> 05:01.678
Okay. So you had a few good days.

05:01.880 --> 05:04.952
You're still old and flabby.
And you smell like BENGAY.

05:06.920 --> 05:09.593
And because of you,
we all have jock itch.

05:18.400 --> 05:21.153
Hey, look. Look, there's Daddy.

05:23.080 --> 05:25.116
Everybody wave.

05:25.320 --> 05:29.029
This is the last time
we'll see Al walking.

05:30.080 --> 05:31.513
You are so lucky, Peggy.

05:31.720 --> 05:34.439
You're finally going to get
handicap parking.

06:23.120 --> 06:25.156
Get your Red Hots.

06:25.360 --> 06:26.918
Devil dogs.

06:27.120 --> 06:30.908
Devilled eggs. Devilled ham.

06:34.160 --> 06:35.479
Smokey.

06:35.680 --> 06:38.274
Yogi. Boo Boo.

06:38.800 --> 06:40.950
What are you doing?

06:41.160 --> 06:43.549
Trying to get the Bears' attention.

06:44.600 --> 06:46.113
No, no, no. I'm sorry.

06:46.320 --> 06:49.915
Shoehorn Bundy will not endorse
any products he doesn't use.

06:50.120 --> 06:53.669
No, it's not just your deodorant,
it's any deodorant.

06:53.880 --> 06:57.190
Hello, PoliGrip?
Yeah. What's your best offer?

06:57.400 --> 06:59.356
I said, "Show me the money. "

06:59.560 --> 07:01.915
You're not even
showing me the wallet.

07:18.200 --> 07:23.672
<i>Bundy, Bundy, Bundy.
Bundy, Bundy, Bundy.</i>

07:23.880 --> 07:26.872
So, Al, it's the final moments
before the start of the Super Bowl.

07:27.080 --> 07:29.036
You've had a miraculous
Cinderella season.

07:29.240 --> 07:30.514
<i>The whole world is wondering:</i>

07:30.720 --> 07:34.076
- How did you do it?
- I sold my soul.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.274
Dedication.

07:36.480 --> 07:40.553
Well, to you young people watching
out there, and to you old people too...

07:40.760 --> 07:44.469
...anything is possible
if you put your soul into it.

07:44.680 --> 07:48.036
- Give them hell, Shoehorn.
- Thanks, J.B.

07:50.360 --> 07:53.636
Congratulations, Mr. Bundy.
You did it.

07:53.840 --> 07:55.990
Thanks to you, Lu,
I'm realizing my dream.

07:56.200 --> 07:58.111
I'm playing in the Super Bowl.

08:00.640 --> 08:03.234
As I'm sure your wife has said to you
many times before...

08:03.440 --> 08:06.352
...Mr. Bundy,
not so fast.

08:07.040 --> 08:10.749
- What?
- I agreed to let you take the Bears...

08:10.960 --> 08:14.077
...to the Super Bowl.
I didn't agree to let you play in it.

08:14.280 --> 08:15.599
But that's not fair.

08:17.880 --> 08:20.394
I'm the devil.

08:20.600 --> 08:23.319
Well, I'm playing,
and you can't stop me.

08:23.520 --> 08:26.717
Well, go ahead. But you'll be playing
without my help.

08:26.920 --> 08:28.353
I don't need your help.

08:28.560 --> 08:31.313
I'm Al "Shoehorn" Bundy,
NFL Rookie of the Year...

08:31.520 --> 08:34.830
...and spokesman for Super PoliGrip,
now available in barbecue.

08:36.520 --> 08:40.592
It's your funeral.
Win one for the Reaper.

08:45.960 --> 08:49.396
- Hey, you okay, Bundy?
- I'm fine.

08:50.040 --> 08:53.112
Okay, 36 blast on three.

08:53.320 --> 08:54.639
Who's talking?

08:54.840 --> 08:57.718
Kramer, is that you?

08:57.920 --> 08:59.114
Speak up.

08:59.760 --> 09:02.433
Okay. Everybody got that?
Ready? Break.

09:05.480 --> 09:09.359
Set. Blue 48. Hut, hut.

09:15.960 --> 09:18.793
Gosh, what a bone-crushing hit.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.719
Oh, but, you know, you hate to see
something like that.

09:21.920 --> 09:24.070
Hey, let's take a look at the replay.

09:25.760 --> 09:28.638
- He's not moving.
- Oh, my God.

09:28.840 --> 09:32.310
He's either dead or having sex.

09:45.760 --> 09:47.239
That was a hell of a hit.

09:47.440 --> 09:50.830
Ironic choice of words.

09:54.400 --> 09:55.355
What's happening?

09:55.560 --> 09:57.835
We're in the hell-evator.

09:58.040 --> 10:00.508
Going down.

10:00.720 --> 10:03.917
But I was supposed to go
to Disneyland.

10:10.480 --> 10:13.438
Jeez, it's hot as hell down here.

10:16.040 --> 10:17.837
Oh, yeah, right.

10:18.040 --> 10:22.431
As a frequent liar, you' re eligible
for our express check-in.

10:23.160 --> 10:26.516
And how long will you be staying?
Oh, forever.

10:29.080 --> 10:31.435
I hope you enjoy your room here
at Club Dead.

10:31.640 --> 10:34.108
It overlooks the cesspool.

10:34.320 --> 10:36.276
And here's your complimentary
Bloody Mary.

10:37.600 --> 10:41.229
Careful. I think some bone
got through the juicer.

10:44.160 --> 10:49.553
Now for my favourite part,
your itinerary of eternal torments.

10:50.520 --> 10:51.714
For the next millennium...

10:51.920 --> 10:55.833
<i>...you'll be dining exclusively on
the most hideous food known to man:</i>

10:56.040 --> 10:58.554
Weenie Tots.

10:59.280 --> 11:00.349
I love those.

11:01.560 --> 11:02.629
Really.

11:02.840 --> 11:06.230
Well, what you don't know
is that a steady diet of Weenie Tots...

11:06.440 --> 11:11.355
...will cause you to spend eternity
in the bathroom.

11:11.760 --> 11:13.990
Why do you think I love them?

11:16.760 --> 11:21.550
All right, Mr. Bundy.
Since you find hell such a picnic...

11:22.720 --> 11:24.676
...how about this?

11:24.880 --> 11:30.000
For the rest of eternity,
you'll never see your family again.

11:31.160 --> 11:33.151
This is heaven.

11:41.240 --> 11:45.233
Could it be the letter P?

11:45.760 --> 11:48.433
Hangman. I win.

11:49.280 --> 11:52.556
It's French fries, you idiot.

11:52.760 --> 11:54.910
You're not too smart, are you, Nap?

12:03.720 --> 12:06.951
Mr. Bundy, your permanent
accommodations are now ready.

12:07.200 --> 12:09.714
Oh, great, great. I'm ready, Lu.

12:09.920 --> 12:13.549
Oh, hey, Lu. What's down there?

12:14.800 --> 12:16.995
Speciality suites for IRS auditors...

12:17.200 --> 12:21.352
...meter maids,
infomercial producers, mimes.

12:23.160 --> 12:26.038
Well, here we are.
I hope this is to your liking.

12:26.240 --> 12:27.389
Oh, I'm sure it will be.

12:30.080 --> 12:31.593
Hey!

12:34.400 --> 12:36.755
What are you guys doing down here?

12:37.000 --> 12:39.958
Well, we were taking your body
to the dump-

12:41.240 --> 12:43.356
I mean, the cemetery.

12:43.560 --> 12:45.630
- when the brakes went out
on the Dodge.

12:45.840 --> 12:47.831
Al Bundy, this is all your fault.

12:48.040 --> 12:52.272
I should be in heaven right now
having sex with young Elvis.

12:52.480 --> 12:55.313
Then it wouldn't be heaven for him
anymore, though, would it?

12:56.280 --> 12:58.316
Are you happy now?

12:58.520 --> 13:02.229
No. Not until you're as miserable
as you can possibly be.

13:02.440 --> 13:05.432
How can it get
any more miserable than this?

13:06.360 --> 13:08.749
Of course.

13:10.640 --> 13:11.868
What happened?

13:12.600 --> 13:16.673
Well, I was dancing
next to your grave...

13:16.880 --> 13:20.873
...I slipped on some confetti,
and the next thing you know, here I am.

13:21.080 --> 13:22.479
How'd you get here?

13:23.440 --> 13:25.431
There was a conga line...

13:27.960 --> 13:31.077
Lu, listen to me. I'm begging you.
Can't you put me somewhere else?

13:31.280 --> 13:34.556
Hey, I hear J. Edgar Hoover
has a queen-size bed.

13:36.760 --> 13:38.955
Have a nice eternity.

13:41.520 --> 13:43.511
You go to...

13:43.720 --> 13:46.518
...here, you bastard.

13:55.040 --> 13:57.315
Peg, I'm home.

13:58.200 --> 14:02.352
Al, shut the door.
You're letting all the flames in.

14:04.560 --> 14:05.549
<i>Okay, home shoppers.</i>

14:05.760 --> 14:11.153
<i>Call now to get in on this lifetime
supply of bonbons for only five cents.</i>

14:16.120 --> 14:17.439
Damn hooves.

14:17.640 --> 14:20.438
They're just a pain in the ass.

14:21.120 --> 14:23.918
Tell me about it, Peg.

14:31.200 --> 14:33.919
I don't know how much more
Isis can take.

14:34.120 --> 14:37.430
It's hard being gentle with claws.

14:41.240 --> 14:43.708
Well, here they are
for the 7 millionth...

14:43.920 --> 14:48.596
...nine hundred and sixteenth
thousand, forty-second time.

14:49.040 --> 14:50.758
Come on, Al, you know the drill.

14:50.960 --> 14:54.475
We can't leave
until you repeat the insult.

14:55.000 --> 14:58.959
Okay. Look who's crossed the road.

14:59.160 --> 15:02.357
I'd say it was a chicken,
but it doesn't have any breasts...

15:02.560 --> 15:04.915
...just nuggets.

15:06.040 --> 15:10.113
And it takes 10 of them
to make a decent meal.

15:18.320 --> 15:19.639
Hey, is Kelly home?

15:20.000 --> 15:21.592
I'm ready. I'm ready.

15:29.280 --> 15:32.033
Hey, I still have a nice body.

15:33.560 --> 15:35.869
God, I hate being a gargoyle.

15:36.080 --> 15:39.038
If anybody needs me,
I'll be perched on the roof.

15:40.200 --> 15:42.873
I can't take this anymore.

15:50.840 --> 15:55.118
No, these plans
for the O.J. plaza are all wrong.

15:56.040 --> 15:57.871
The F. Lee Bailey bar goes here...

15:58.080 --> 16:01.231
...and the Kato Kaelin lounge
goes over there.

16:01.440 --> 16:03.635
Get it right.

16:04.680 --> 16:07.877
Hey, Lu, I want my soul back.

16:08.240 --> 16:10.993
" I want my soul back.
I want my soul back. "

16:11.200 --> 16:14.192
That's all I hear from you
and Tiger Woods.

16:14.400 --> 16:16.755
Tiger Woods sold his soul?

16:16.960 --> 16:20.839
Of course. You don't think
anybody's really that good, do you?

16:21.640 --> 16:23.949
- Red Hots?
- Oh, thanks.

16:24.160 --> 16:26.515
Hey. You like to play games.

16:26.720 --> 16:30.633
Football, one on one, me against you,
winner take all.

16:31.280 --> 16:32.429
I don't know.

16:33.480 --> 16:37.314
So the big, bad,
fire-spitting devil is all talk.

16:42.200 --> 16:45.158
Not that I don't respect
a little fire spitting.

16:45.360 --> 16:48.955
Look, Bundy, I've been pretty easy
on you up until now.

16:49.160 --> 16:51.833
But if you want me
to turn up the heat...

16:52.040 --> 16:54.031
...you're going down.

16:54.920 --> 16:57.388
I'm already down.

16:58.080 --> 16:59.991
Let's rock.

17:03.800 --> 17:05.869
I thought this was just between
you and me.

17:07.240 --> 17:10.550
Allow me to introduce my team.

17:11.440 --> 17:14.829
Erik the Red, Attila the Hun...

17:15.040 --> 17:17.952
...Genghis Khan, Brutus...

17:18.160 --> 17:20.674
...and my favourite, Goliath.

17:22.240 --> 17:24.231
These guys aren't football players.

17:24.440 --> 17:27.557
I know. They just hurt people.

17:28.560 --> 17:30.391
That's not fair.
I don't have a team.

17:30.600 --> 17:33.398
Oh, sure you do, Al.

17:34.080 --> 17:36.469
Hey, Daddy. All right.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.070
Like I said, I don't have a team.

17:41.680 --> 17:44.911
Okay, guys.
Now, this is sudden death.

17:47.520 --> 17:49.397
No kidding.

17:50.400 --> 17:52.755
All we have to do
is score the first touchdown...

17:52.960 --> 17:54.029
...and we get to go home.

17:54.240 --> 17:56.708
So give me the ball
and stay out of my way.

17:56.920 --> 18:00.390
- Can I get a "whoa, Bundy"?
- Whoa, Bundy!

18:03.360 --> 18:04.679
Ready.

18:04.880 --> 18:05.949
Hut one.

18:09.760 --> 18:11.478
Yes.

18:12.840 --> 18:14.478
Okay, a new plan.

18:14.680 --> 18:19.390
Stay out of my way,
but stay in their way.

18:19.840 --> 18:21.831
Can I get a "whoa, Bundy"?

18:22.040 --> 18:24.235
Whoa, Bundy.

18:31.480 --> 18:32.913
All right.

18:33.120 --> 18:34.473
New plan.

18:35.000 --> 18:38.709
They're expecting me to get the ball.
Let's change all that.

18:38.920 --> 18:40.433
Can I get a "whoa, Bundy"?

18:41.080 --> 18:42.513
All right.

18:42.840 --> 18:46.753
- Hut one. Jefferson. Jefferson.
- What? What? Hey, hey.

18:46.960 --> 18:48.109
I don't want it.

18:56.520 --> 18:58.750
Having some fun now,
huh, Bundy?

18:58.960 --> 19:02.839
Maybe when hell freezes over,
we can play hockey.

19:04.360 --> 19:06.396
All right. This is our last chance.

19:06.600 --> 19:09.797
Jefferson, it's time
for the Hail Mary.

19:11.520 --> 19:14.318
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

19:14.520 --> 19:17.876
Not the prayer. The pass.

19:18.080 --> 19:20.435
- Ready. Break.
- Break.

19:20.640 --> 19:22.119
Hold on.

19:23.240 --> 19:28.234
Three eight five! Three eight five!
Six hut.

19:57.200 --> 19:59.953
Hey, I was about to catch that.

20:00.960 --> 20:04.032
Are you sure you want to?

20:04.240 --> 20:06.470
You see, Al, if you catch the ball...

20:06.680 --> 20:09.956
...I send you all back together
as we agreed.

20:10.160 --> 20:12.958
However, if you drop the ball...

20:13.640 --> 20:16.871
...I'll still send you back,
not with them...

20:17.080 --> 20:18.718
...but with them.

20:23.400 --> 20:25.789
- Come on, Al.
- Yeah, you can do it.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.355
- You can do it.
- Come on.

20:28.920 --> 20:32.071
- Come on, Al.
- Yeah, you can do it.

20:36.920 --> 20:37.875
Al?

20:38.080 --> 20:39.513
Al, come on. Are you all right?

20:39.720 --> 20:41.597
Get up. Come on.

20:42.520 --> 20:44.158
I'm home. I'm-

20:44.360 --> 20:45.759
I'm really home.

20:45.960 --> 20:47.837
Well, of course you're home.

20:48.040 --> 20:50.395
Where the hell else would you be?

20:50.600 --> 20:54.434
Exactly. I was in hell.
And you were there...

20:54.640 --> 20:57.791
...and you were there,
and you were there, and...

20:58.000 --> 21:00.878
And, of course, you were there.

21:01.200 --> 21:03.156
He's fine.

21:03.360 --> 21:05.396
Nice going with
the dinner table, Al.

21:05.600 --> 21:07.830
Yeah. Now what are we
not gonna eat on?

21:09.200 --> 21:12.715
I can't believe you went to hell
and didn't even bring me a souvenir.

21:14.680 --> 21:17.114
Hey, Al, the NFL draft is on.

21:17.320 --> 21:19.788
It must have been a dream.

21:25.840 --> 21:28.593
There's no hell like home.
