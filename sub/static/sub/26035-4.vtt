WEBVTT

00:00.217 --> 00:02.480
CHARLIE:
Come on, hurry up, guys.
I want to get a good seat.

00:02.524 --> 00:04.091
DENNIS:
What do you mean
you want to get...

00:04.134 --> 00:06.397
Charlie, this is a sexual
harassment seminar.

00:06.441 --> 00:07.833
There are no "good seats."
Where are you going?

00:07.877 --> 00:09.400
-Up front.
-This is so unfair.

00:09.444 --> 00:11.054
I mean, I'm not saying
it doesn't happen to, like,

00:11.098 --> 00:12.447
loads of women all the time,

00:12.490 --> 00:14.710
but I don't harass anybody,
so why am I here?

00:14.753 --> 00:17.408
Because some Internet warrior
put Paddy's on a list

00:17.452 --> 00:19.062
of unsafe places for women.

00:19.106 --> 00:20.629
And we can't have that, okay?

00:20.672 --> 00:22.152
-Not in this climate.
-Right.

00:22.196 --> 00:24.894
Ugh! You kids and your climates.

00:24.937 --> 00:28.289
Back in the day,
I banged all my secretaries.

00:28.332 --> 00:29.638
-Frank.
-That's the way you did it.

00:29.681 --> 00:32.293
You hire some girl
with no experience,

00:32.336 --> 00:34.295
you bang her, you promote her.

00:34.338 --> 00:36.427
It's a win-win situation
for everybody,

00:36.471 --> 00:38.081
except for the wives.

00:38.125 --> 00:41.302
Frank, modulate your volume,
okay? This is serious, okay?

00:41.345 --> 00:44.305
The future of Paddy's depends
on us completing this seminar.

00:44.348 --> 00:45.697
You guys should be
really worried.

00:45.741 --> 00:47.438
I'm not worried about anything,
man. If anyone should be

00:47.482 --> 00:49.440
worried about weird shit
with women, it's you, bro.

00:49.484 --> 00:51.312
-[Frank chuckles]
-The only reason we're here

00:51.355 --> 00:53.227
is because you DENNIS'd
someone, probably,

00:53.270 --> 00:55.664
and she put us on the list.
We're only here 'cause of you.

00:55.707 --> 00:57.492
Yeah, you perv. You happy now?

00:57.535 --> 00:59.102
-You happy?
-Happy?

00:59.146 --> 01:01.104
[scoffs]
You guys, this isn't about me.

01:01.148 --> 01:02.671
I don't know if you noticed,

01:02.714 --> 01:04.455
but women are on a little bit
of a rampage right now

01:04.499 --> 01:06.718
and anyone could be
taken down at any moment,

01:06.762 --> 01:09.286
so, you know, no,
I'm not happy right now.

01:09.330 --> 01:11.332
Who could possibly
be happy right now?

01:11.375 --> 01:12.550
Hey-o!

01:12.594 --> 01:14.465
Who's ready to party?!

01:14.509 --> 01:16.119
♪ Time's up, time's up,
time's up♪

01:16.163 --> 01:18.513
♪ Time's up, time's up,
time's up.♪ [laughs]

01:18.556 --> 01:21.168
♪

01:41.318 --> 01:43.146
Hello. I'm Kate.

01:43.190 --> 01:45.583
And I want to begin today
by addressing the reason

01:45.627 --> 01:47.368
that we're all here,
the so-called

01:47.411 --> 01:51.023
"Shitty Bar List"
of unsafe places for women.

01:51.067 --> 01:52.373
Ah, yes.
Uh, just a quick question.

01:52.416 --> 01:54.157
How many points do we need?

01:54.201 --> 01:55.941
I'm sorry, points?

01:55.985 --> 01:57.334
Yeah, how many points
do we need to score

01:57.378 --> 01:59.336
to get our name
taken off the list?

01:59.380 --> 02:01.556
Oh. No, there's no points.

02:01.599 --> 02:03.166
Everything is graded
by points, right?

02:03.210 --> 02:04.385
I mean, otherwise,
how could the Eagles

02:04.428 --> 02:05.386
have won the Super Bowl, right?

02:05.429 --> 02:07.388
All you have to do
is complete the seminar

02:07.431 --> 02:09.955
and then your bar will have
its name removed from the list.

02:09.999 --> 02:11.392
-There you go. Simple.
-CHARLIE: Yeah, but our-our name

02:11.435 --> 02:13.176
shouldn't even be
on that list 'cause, like,

02:13.220 --> 02:16.397
we don't really have any history
of misbehavior at Paddy's Pub.

02:16.440 --> 02:18.747
Well, I'm sure a lot of people
here today feel that way,

02:18.790 --> 02:21.793
but I encourage you
to keep your minds open...

02:21.837 --> 02:24.361
And your dicks in your pants.
[laughs]

02:24.405 --> 02:26.189
Ma'am, that kind of language
is inappropriate

02:26.233 --> 02:28.235
in a professional setting.

02:28.278 --> 02:31.194
That's one of the things that
you'll learn in the seminar.

02:31.238 --> 02:32.848
Uh, yes? Do you have a question?

02:32.891 --> 02:35.590
Statute of limitations.

02:35.633 --> 02:37.374
Okay. I'm just trying to get
through the introduction here,

02:37.418 --> 02:41.248
but since you asked,
the federal law is 300 days

02:41.291 --> 02:44.294
from the last act,
depending on the state and...

02:44.338 --> 02:46.209
Sir, are you leaving?

02:46.253 --> 02:47.602
-Frank!
-What?

02:47.645 --> 02:50.431
They got nothing on me
past '92, tops.

02:50.474 --> 02:52.215
DENNIS:
Hold on a second there.

02:52.259 --> 02:54.435
Uh, pardon me, Kate, but, um,
aren't some states considering

02:54.478 --> 02:58.047
doing away with the statute
of limitations altogether?

02:58.090 --> 03:00.876
Some states like, uh, Nevada?

03:00.919 --> 03:02.486
KATE:
Yes, that's right.

03:02.530 --> 03:03.792
Can they do that?

03:03.835 --> 03:05.576
It's possible. Yes.

03:05.620 --> 03:06.795
FRANK:
Nevada, huh?

03:06.838 --> 03:10.059
Ah, it's getting warm in here.

03:10.102 --> 03:12.801
Uh, got to make
some calls. Shit.

03:12.844 --> 03:16.239
You can continue now.

03:16.283 --> 03:20.025
I promise you there will be
no further interruptions.

03:20.069 --> 03:21.592
Right. We're gonna jump
right into the group work.

03:21.636 --> 03:23.246
Half of you are gonna go with me

03:23.290 --> 03:25.640
and the rest will be led
by my associate Alan.

03:25.683 --> 03:27.468
Hello, everyone. I'm Alan.

03:27.511 --> 03:29.034
Oh! Here comes the boss man.

03:29.078 --> 03:30.427
-Finally, a dude.
-Yeah.

03:30.471 --> 03:31.689
Yeah, okay, cool.
He's in charge.

03:31.733 --> 03:35.476
Uh, ma'am? Could we go
with Alan, please?

03:35.519 --> 03:38.261
Actually, I think we should
split your group up.

03:38.305 --> 03:41.090
That's, uh, that's gonna
be a lot harder for me

03:41.133 --> 03:43.353
-to keep tabs on you guys.
-Don't worry, Dennis.

03:43.397 --> 03:44.659
I'm gonna make you so proud.

03:44.702 --> 03:46.443
I'm gonna work really hard
and get all the points and...

03:46.487 --> 03:47.488
What is with you and the points?

03:47.531 --> 03:49.054
There are no points.
We established that.

03:49.098 --> 03:50.839
Well, that's how the Eagles
won the Super Bowl.

03:50.882 --> 03:51.840
I know that's how
the Eagles won the...

03:51.883 --> 03:53.276
but this isn't the Eagles. Okay?

03:53.320 --> 03:54.669
-This is a seminar.
-MAC: Go Birds, though.

03:54.712 --> 03:56.627
-Oh, go Birds, go Birds.
-All right, fine, go Birds. Yes.

03:56.671 --> 03:58.281
I know. Go Birds.
Get your hand off my knee.

03:58.325 --> 03:59.674
Look, just sit here
and do nothing.

03:59.717 --> 04:01.284
ALAN:
So, in this room

04:01.328 --> 04:03.068
we're going to be talking
about harassment

04:03.112 --> 04:04.418
in the workplace.

04:04.461 --> 04:07.290
And thank you to Elliot
who's agreed to play our boss.

04:07.334 --> 04:09.423
I'll just need another volunteer
from the group.

04:09.466 --> 04:10.859
-Oh! Oh! Alan!
-Alan! Alan! Alan!

04:10.902 --> 04:12.556
-Uh, so, uh...
-Alan! Alan!

04:12.600 --> 04:15.080
Sir, would you mind
just jumping in for me?

04:15.124 --> 04:16.430
-Thank you.
-[Charlie groans]

04:16.473 --> 04:17.909
Um, great.
So just read from the script

04:17.953 --> 04:20.347
and I'll jump in as and when.

04:20.390 --> 04:22.436
"Good morning, boss."

04:22.479 --> 04:26.440
"Hello, Johnson. Have that
report on my desk by 5:00.

04:26.483 --> 04:29.660
-"Hey, did you see the boobs
on that new intern?"
-And stop.

04:29.704 --> 04:32.446
Now, can anyone tell me
what the boss did wrong there?

04:32.489 --> 04:34.448
Yeah. He mumbled his lines.

04:34.491 --> 04:35.927
I didn't believe a word
out of his mouth.

04:35.971 --> 04:38.539
Uh, no, sorry.
I mean in the scenario.

04:38.582 --> 04:40.889
-He-he used vulgar language.
-That is correct.

04:40.932 --> 04:42.325
B-But she didn't hear it.

04:42.369 --> 04:43.892
This is just locker room talk
between guys.

04:43.935 --> 04:46.111
Now, that's actually
a common misconception, okay?

04:46.155 --> 04:47.678
Lewd comments can be
a form of harassment

04:47.722 --> 04:49.767
even if directed
to a third party.

04:49.811 --> 04:51.943
But it's not for her.
It's about her.

04:51.987 --> 04:53.597
No, sorry. It's-it's actually,

04:53.641 --> 04:55.120
it's the employee
who's talking to the boss

04:55.164 --> 04:56.557
that is the one
that was offended.

04:56.600 --> 04:57.601
-What? Why?
-No, no, no, the employee

04:57.645 --> 04:59.429
-would find it hilarious.
-Yeah.

04:59.473 --> 05:01.605
I mean, not this guy 'cause
the boss sucks at telling jokes.

05:01.649 --> 05:03.781
-No offense to you, sir.
-Well, also, we really don't
know how funny the joke is yet

05:03.825 --> 05:05.783
'cause we haven't seen the
girl's boobs. Can we see them?

05:05.827 --> 05:08.003
Okay. Uh, let's... [laughs]
...let's switch gears.

05:08.046 --> 05:10.222
Maybe try a different scenario.
Thanks, gents.

05:10.266 --> 05:11.920
Just, uh, uh, take a seat.

05:11.963 --> 05:15.924
Um, so, uh, Mac, what is it
that you do at the bar?

05:15.967 --> 05:18.579
-I am the head of security
at Paddy's Pub.
-He's our doorman.

05:18.622 --> 05:20.711
-No, he's just, like,
our gay guy now.
-No, well...

05:20.755 --> 05:22.713
Great. So, you check IDs.
That-that sort of thing.

05:22.757 --> 05:24.976
-He should.
-Not once has he ever
checked an ID.

05:25.020 --> 05:26.717
-It's one aspect of the job.
-Yeah, he should.

05:26.761 --> 05:29.764
Why don't you, why don't you hop
up here and we'll do a little

05:29.807 --> 05:31.635
scenario that-that might be
a little more familiar to you.

05:31.679 --> 05:33.594
-You are very tall.
-Yes, I am.

05:33.637 --> 05:35.509
Now, should I take my shirt off
for the scenario?

05:35.552 --> 05:36.858
Because I feel like
standing next to you,

05:36.901 --> 05:38.425
they're not gonna be
as intimidated,

05:38.468 --> 05:39.948
but if I were to take my shirt
off, they would be intimidated.

05:39.991 --> 05:41.253
I'm not in the scenario.

05:41.297 --> 05:42.820
-We're good. We're good.
-Yeah, we're okay.

05:42.864 --> 05:44.518
-We get it. We get it.
-That's him doing
his gay guy thing.

05:44.561 --> 05:46.520
So, uh, can we also get
a female customer?

05:46.563 --> 05:48.043
-Ooh, yeah.
-A volunteer?

05:48.086 --> 05:50.437
-I will be the young
female customer.
-[groans]

05:50.480 --> 05:52.613
Young female customer.
Great, good. Yes.

05:52.656 --> 05:56.181
Okay. Well, um, just, uh, do
your job as you would normally

05:56.225 --> 05:58.183
and I will, um,
you know, jump in

05:58.227 --> 05:59.620
if you cross over
into any gray areas.

05:59.663 --> 06:00.969
Okay. So what's my character?

06:01.012 --> 06:02.405
Uh, you're just trying
to get into the bar.

06:02.449 --> 06:03.972
Yeah, but why?

06:04.015 --> 06:06.191
To get a drink, I suppose.

06:06.235 --> 06:07.758
Why? I just drank three beers
on the way over.

06:07.802 --> 06:09.804
You don't show up
at a bar sober.

06:09.847 --> 06:11.545
What a waste of money.
What are you gonna...

06:11.588 --> 06:13.503
Just you're trying
to get into the bar.

06:13.547 --> 06:15.200
-I'm here for revenge.
-Okay. Sure.

06:15.244 --> 06:16.637
Alan, what's my character again?

06:16.680 --> 06:20.423
-You're the doorman.
-Right.

06:20.467 --> 06:21.816
And how many drinks
have I had at this point?

06:21.859 --> 06:23.426
You are... you're not
in the scenario.

06:23.470 --> 06:25.559
-I've had five.
-Okay. Marvelous.

06:25.602 --> 06:27.561
Let's, uh, let's begin
whenever you're ready.

06:27.604 --> 06:30.085
[clears throat]
Excuse me, sir, have you...

06:30.128 --> 06:31.826
-I got your cargo!
-[all shouting]

06:31.869 --> 06:33.871
-Whoa!
-Wow.

06:33.915 --> 06:36.657
-[Charlie laughs]
-ALAN: Jesus Christ.

06:36.700 --> 06:37.788
Why did you do that?

06:37.832 --> 06:39.573
Oh, well, well, she came at me,

06:39.616 --> 06:41.618
-and it was sort of my instinct.
-That was amazing.

06:41.662 --> 06:44.012
-That was great, right?
-You got me, like,
a foot off the ground.

06:44.055 --> 06:46.580
-A-Are you okay?
-Yeah, yeah.
No, it doesn't hurt.

06:46.623 --> 06:48.451
Did it-did it make you
feel humiliated?

06:48.495 --> 06:50.018
Did it make you-make you
feel small?

06:50.061 --> 06:51.672
That's what it is,
it made me feel teeny-tiny.

06:51.715 --> 06:53.500
-Like Thumbelina.
-That's what I was going for.
Thumbelina!

06:53.543 --> 06:54.457
That's the highest
I've ever gotten.

06:54.501 --> 06:55.893
He's never gotten me
that high before.

06:55.937 --> 06:57.678
You're lucky I haven't
called the police.

06:57.721 --> 06:59.070
Why-why would you call
the police?

06:59.114 --> 07:01.725
Oh, wait. H-Hold on.
Is that sexual harassment?

07:01.769 --> 07:03.510
No, that is sexual assault.

07:03.553 --> 07:05.033
-Really?
-Assault?
-[clock ticking]

07:05.076 --> 07:07.688
No. Dee, Dee.
I did not assault you.

07:07.731 --> 07:10.168
Please tell Alan
that I did not assault you.

07:10.212 --> 07:11.474
Well, now that I've

07:11.518 --> 07:13.476
gotten a little distance
from the event...

07:13.520 --> 07:15.609
Wha... No, Alan, we do this
kind of stuff all the time.

07:15.652 --> 07:18.133
W... Charlie,
would you tell him?

07:18.176 --> 07:20.483
-He's gone.
-If you do this all the time,

07:20.527 --> 07:21.658
you-you've got
a big problem, all right?

07:21.702 --> 07:23.051
She could press charges.

07:23.094 --> 07:25.706
-Could I?
-No.
-[clock ticking faster]

07:25.749 --> 07:27.490
No! Dee. No.

07:27.534 --> 07:29.623
-He just said I could, so...
-Oh, God.

07:29.666 --> 07:31.625
It just, i-it...
did somebody turn up the heat?

07:31.668 --> 07:33.104
Yeah, you sweating? You sweating
a little bit, Ronald?

07:33.148 --> 07:35.455
-Yeah?
-No, it's just the climate is...

07:40.155 --> 07:41.983
KATE: But the term
"sexual harassment"

07:42.026 --> 07:45.160
wasn't coined until 1975,

07:45.203 --> 07:47.641
-by a woman named Carmita Wood.
-Carmita Wood. Oh. I'm sorry.

07:47.684 --> 07:49.860
-Sorry.
-[chuckles]
You really know your history.

07:49.904 --> 07:52.341
-Well, this is important stuff.
-DEE: Oh, please.

07:52.384 --> 07:54.735
-God, get lost, Dee.
-No way, I'm on a roll.

07:54.778 --> 07:56.519
-So who could tell me...
-DEE: [clears throat] Hey.

07:56.563 --> 07:58.521
Is it sexual harassment
when a man

07:58.565 --> 08:01.524
constantly calls
his female coworker a bird?

08:01.568 --> 08:04.919
That depends. Is that
a sexual innuendo of some kind?

08:04.962 --> 08:07.095
Just a big dumb flightless bird.

08:07.138 --> 08:10.533
Well, it's not very nice,
but it's not sexual harassment.

08:10.577 --> 08:12.796
[laughs quietly]
Nice try, you dumb bitch.

08:12.840 --> 08:14.798
[regular volume]:
Um, Kate, if I may, yeah.

08:14.842 --> 08:16.583
Um, federal law
really only recognizes

08:16.626 --> 08:18.541
two types of sexual harassment:

08:18.585 --> 08:22.545
quid pro quo
and hostile work environment.

08:22.589 --> 08:24.112
That is very good, Dennis.

08:24.155 --> 08:25.766
-Thank you.
-No, no, don't do that.

08:25.809 --> 08:27.681
This man is a monster.
Believe you me.

08:27.724 --> 08:29.770
-[chuckles]: What?
-He is the worst person I know.

08:29.813 --> 08:32.337
You got to protect me
on this, Larry.

08:32.381 --> 08:34.775
I... Start with the secretaries.

08:34.818 --> 08:36.777
Oh, Jesus Christ, Frank. Pants.

08:36.820 --> 08:37.995
I was sweating
through my clothes.

08:38.039 --> 08:39.823
It's this damn climate.

08:39.867 --> 08:41.564
Sir, that robe is inappropriate.

08:41.608 --> 08:44.175
-And I don't think...
-Hon, I'm on the phone, you see?

08:44.219 --> 08:47.831
I don't know.
I bought her a Camaro. No,

08:47.875 --> 08:49.572
you know I don't go Chinese.

08:49.616 --> 08:51.008
I don't know why, I just don't.

08:51.052 --> 08:52.967
Korean?

08:53.010 --> 08:54.969
Oh, put her on the list.

08:55.012 --> 08:56.666
I really did a number on her.

08:56.710 --> 08:58.450
-[laughs]
-Yeah...

08:58.494 --> 08:59.800
Why don't we take a break?

09:01.845 --> 09:03.630
Got to get your shit
together, Frank.

09:03.673 --> 09:05.675
-You...
-Oh, I wish I was dead.

09:05.719 --> 09:07.590
These vultures are picking
my carcass clean.

09:07.634 --> 09:09.592
Whoa, Frank. Hey, stop talking.

09:09.636 --> 09:11.376
-Where'd you get that robe?
-Upstairs.

09:11.420 --> 09:13.161
I got to get one
of them, man. Nice.

09:13.204 --> 09:14.989
Whoa. Wait, Jesus, Mac.
What the hell happened to you?

09:15.032 --> 09:18.383
I'm gonna be honest. The first
half has not gone well.

09:18.427 --> 09:20.821
-You got exposed, too?
-Oh, yeah, he did. Big time.

09:20.864 --> 09:22.823
He did a role-play thing,
it went bad.

09:22.866 --> 09:24.651
Wait, role-playing thing? Y-You
were supposed to do nothing.

09:24.694 --> 09:26.696
I mean, n-now you're all
sweaty and twitchy?

09:26.740 --> 09:28.176
Well, it's-it's so hot in here.

09:28.219 --> 09:29.743
I mean, I feel like
they crank up the heat.

09:29.786 --> 09:31.614
Oh, they cranked it up.
I'm roasting.

09:31.658 --> 09:35.618
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Which one
of you just grabbed my ass?

09:35.662 --> 09:36.837
[laughs]

09:36.880 --> 09:39.013
Did you see that?
Did you see...

09:39.056 --> 09:40.841
[whispers]:
Th-That is a problem for us.

09:40.884 --> 09:42.799
Their powers
are growing. Okay?

09:42.843 --> 09:45.410
Now, we got to start taking this
more seriously, okay?

09:45.454 --> 09:47.848
Can you guys just go back
in there and do nothing, okay?

09:47.891 --> 09:49.763
Just don't say or do anything.

09:49.806 --> 09:51.503
KATE:
Can anyone tell me

09:51.547 --> 09:53.767
the two types
of sexual harassment?

09:53.810 --> 09:56.639
Oh. Oh, oh. Uh, uh,
flirting and groping.

09:56.683 --> 09:59.468
No! Uh, groping
and-and dick pics.

09:59.511 --> 10:01.470
Yeah, I-I know that sending
dick pics is one of them.

10:01.513 --> 10:03.994
You're kidding. Christ.

10:04.038 --> 10:06.736
-I got to shoot some texts.
-KATE: Actually,

10:06.780 --> 10:09.696
it's quid pro quo
and hostile work environment.

10:09.739 --> 10:11.088
Would you please stop
interrupting me? Because...

10:11.132 --> 10:13.787
-[laughs]: Ooh, ooh, burn.
-And you.

10:13.830 --> 10:15.658
Could you please sit down?

10:15.702 --> 10:16.703
No, it's cool. I'm on your side.

10:16.746 --> 10:18.269
There are no sides.

10:18.313 --> 10:20.271
Shit, I just looked at her tits.

10:20.315 --> 10:22.447
-Frank! Don't tell her that.
-Okay, don't panic.

10:22.491 --> 10:24.928
A passing glance
is not sexual harassment.

10:24.972 --> 10:26.713
Oh. I like your tactic here.

10:26.756 --> 10:28.279
Get them all horny
with your titties.

10:28.323 --> 10:29.890
That's when they make
their mistakes.

10:29.933 --> 10:31.892
Ma'am, that's victim blaming.

10:31.935 --> 10:33.937
No, I'm blaming Frank.
He's been staring at your boobs

10:33.981 --> 10:35.722
this whole time. Still doing it.

10:35.765 --> 10:37.158
MAC:
Frank!

10:37.201 --> 10:40.727
What? I'm not allowed
to like things anymore?

10:40.770 --> 10:43.817
-It's a compliment.
-How is that a compliment?

10:43.860 --> 10:46.167
Well, they're not thatgreat.

10:46.210 --> 10:47.734
Make her feel good.

10:47.777 --> 10:49.387
-Hey, hey, hey.
Don't let them get to you.
-Okay...

10:49.431 --> 10:50.867
Okay? Your tits are fine.

10:50.911 --> 10:52.739
ALAN:
Okay, everybody,

10:52.782 --> 10:54.828
if, uh, you could
take a seat, please.

10:54.871 --> 10:57.526
So, now what
we're gonna do is, uh,

10:57.569 --> 11:00.050
imagine
a-a hypothetical scenario,

11:00.094 --> 11:02.183
uh, based right here
in Philadelphia.

11:02.226 --> 11:04.968
So, uh, imagine a-a woman,
we'll call her "the waitress,"

11:05.012 --> 11:07.057
-who works at
a local coffee shop.
-[clock ticking]

11:07.101 --> 11:09.756
Now, i-in this particular
instance, this waitress

11:09.799 --> 11:12.541
is being harassed
by one of her customers.

11:12.584 --> 11:14.325
He's following her home
from work, uh,

11:14.369 --> 11:17.415
digging through her trash
and calling her repeatedly,

11:17.459 --> 11:19.635
until she complains
to her boss about it.

11:19.679 --> 11:21.506
Now, the boss does nothing.

11:21.550 --> 11:24.509
Can anyone tell me
who's legally at fault here?

11:24.553 --> 11:26.773
-Ooh. Wow, what
do you think, Charlie?
-Yeah.

11:26.816 --> 11:28.775
I-I think the waitress is.

11:28.818 --> 11:30.559
Y-You know, 'cause, for...
She doesn't realize

11:30.602 --> 11:32.953
that, like, true love is
in front of her stupid face.

11:32.996 --> 11:34.781
-Well...
-Why would she say
that's an assault?

11:34.824 --> 11:36.870
Hold on a second.
Now, this is just a-this is just

11:36.913 --> 11:39.220
a hypothetical, uh,
scenario that he's painting.

11:39.263 --> 11:40.874
He's not getting
the whole big picture, right?

11:40.917 --> 11:42.876
-Well, of course,
it's a hypothetical.
-I know, but maybe

11:42.919 --> 11:44.094
she, like, only thought, like,

11:44.138 --> 11:45.661
she wasn't into him,
but then, like,

11:45.705 --> 11:47.358
15 years later,
when she needed a baby, like,

11:47.402 --> 11:49.143
really bad, and she'd been
in and out of, like,

11:49.186 --> 11:51.014
-a women's shelter,
he banged her.
-ALAN: Sorry.

11:51.058 --> 11:54.670
That-that doesn't mean that
the customer didn't harass.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.672
All right, well then, I think
all of the customers' friends

11:56.716 --> 11:57.934
harassed her, too,
because they all banged her.

11:57.978 --> 11:59.370
-I mean, he did.
-That's true.

11:59.414 --> 12:00.894
Oh, well, don't
bring me into th...

12:00.937 --> 12:03.157
This is a hypothetical scenario.
I'm not involved.

12:03.200 --> 12:05.246
-Neither are you.
-She also did hand stuff to Mac.

12:05.289 --> 12:07.248
She did. I-It wasn't
very good, though.

12:07.291 --> 12:09.337
All right, look, are you trying
to tell me that no matter what,

12:09.380 --> 12:11.818
it's always just gonna be
the customer's fault?

12:11.861 --> 12:14.821
It is, in fact,
the boss's fault.

12:14.864 --> 12:16.823
The boss.

12:16.866 --> 12:18.912
Well, that makes sense.
I always hated Seth.

12:18.955 --> 12:20.957
-He's a real creep.
-Well, you don't know his name

12:21.001 --> 12:23.003
because this is hypothetical,
and he didn't say t-that...

12:23.046 --> 12:24.700
Well, it doesn't matter anyway,
'cause she just said

12:24.744 --> 12:25.832
what I-what I did to her
wasn't harassment

12:25.875 --> 12:27.485
because Seth did it to her.

12:27.529 --> 12:29.009
Sorry. I... Can I just
make this very clear, okay?

12:29.052 --> 12:31.359
What the customer
did was harassment.

12:31.402 --> 12:32.839
-Right.
-Yes. Ifit were you.

12:32.882 --> 12:34.710
And so, take in the information,
but don't take it personally.

12:34.754 --> 12:36.494
Uh, yeah, technically, don't,
like, I get, like, a free pass

12:36.538 --> 12:38.801
and stuff?
'Cause I mean, I was molested.

12:38.845 --> 12:40.498
-[audience murmuring]
-Ah... W-Well, now, actually,
that is true.

12:40.542 --> 12:42.022
He did get molested
by his Uncle Jack.

12:42.065 --> 12:43.588
His-his Uncle Jack
got to him pretty good.

12:43.632 --> 12:44.851
-No, Uncle Jack
never molested me.
-Oh.

12:44.894 --> 12:46.591
-I dodged him.
-Oh, no, he got you. He got you.

12:46.635 --> 12:48.593
-He got you big time.
-You weren't there.

12:48.637 --> 12:49.986
-You wrote a whole play
about it.
-Yeah, you did write a play.

12:50.030 --> 12:52.510
-I got molested by Dee.
-What?!

12:52.554 --> 12:54.861
What? Oh, c...
That's ludicrous.

12:54.904 --> 12:56.732
No, it's true.
Like, a couple years ago,

12:56.776 --> 12:58.516
she banged me,
and I didn't want to do it.

12:58.560 --> 13:00.867
-There you go.
-Wait, wait.
You had sex with Charlie?

13:00.910 --> 13:02.085
-Oh, God.
-You had sex with Dee?

13:02.129 --> 13:03.652
-Yeah.
-Yeah, yeah.

13:03.695 --> 13:05.654
We, okay, it was a mistake.

13:05.697 --> 13:08.222
-Yeah, I'll say.
-I-It... I re-I regret
every second of it,

13:08.265 --> 13:09.745
-but it was consensual.
-It was not!

13:09.789 --> 13:11.747
I totally wanted her
to stop, and, like,

13:11.791 --> 13:14.184
I was very intimidated
by her larger frame.

13:14.228 --> 13:16.099
-Oh, yeah, I can see that. Yeah.
-So, you know.

13:16.143 --> 13:18.101
I have a petite frame.
I... I-It's a Thumbelina frame.

13:18.145 --> 13:20.103
-I don't... Not to me.
-Y-You didn't tell me to stop.

13:20.147 --> 13:22.105
Yeah, and I kept saying...
[muffled protests]

13:22.149 --> 13:23.890
And you're like, "Shut up!
Stop talking! Be still.

13:23.933 --> 13:26.327
"Let me do my thing.
I can't, I can't get off

13:26.370 --> 13:27.894
with you moving
and talking and shit."

13:27.937 --> 13:29.896
Oh, shit. Yup.
That's ringing a bell.

13:29.939 --> 13:31.636
Jesus, Dee. Ugh, God.

13:31.680 --> 13:33.116
All right, but, yeah...
[stammers]

13:33.160 --> 13:34.770
Either way, It does...
I can't molest you, you know?

13:34.814 --> 13:37.120
It doesn't work that way, 'cause
I'm a woman and you're the man.

13:37.164 --> 13:38.774
Right, right?
Back me up, girlfriend.

13:38.818 --> 13:41.777
Actually, a woman cansexually
harass and even rape a man.

13:41.821 --> 13:43.039
Is that what happened here?

13:43.083 --> 13:45.563
-[bell dings, clock ticking]
-Gosh, I mean, maybe.

13:45.607 --> 13:48.001
No, no, no, no. You don't,
you don't just throw around

13:48.044 --> 13:49.959
the-the "R" word, Kate.
It's hot, right?

13:50.003 --> 13:51.265
FRANK:
Yello?

13:51.308 --> 13:55.138
What? Wha... Well, find her
through the abortion records.

13:55.182 --> 13:57.575
Can the group from Paddy's Pub
please focus up.

13:57.619 --> 13:58.925
You guys have been
very disruptive.

13:58.968 --> 14:00.796
Well, maybe you should
explain it more better,

14:00.840 --> 14:02.232
because I'm totally
confused about...

14:02.276 --> 14:04.017
Maybe if you stopped
interrupting.

14:04.060 --> 14:06.019
Maybe if you two stopped
sucking a fat dick.

14:06.062 --> 14:09.152
-You do suck a fat dick.
-You've sucked a dick
through this process.

14:09.196 --> 14:10.893
What? Are you kidding me?
After all of this,

14:10.937 --> 14:12.242
I ended up firing her?

14:12.286 --> 14:13.765
[all groaning]

14:13.809 --> 14:15.158
Oh, my God.

14:15.202 --> 14:17.944
Hey, Larry? How soon
can you get to the Hyatt?

14:17.987 --> 14:20.076
My dong fell out.
Some woman saw it.

14:20.120 --> 14:21.164
Well, goddamn it.

14:21.208 --> 14:22.905
DENNIS:
All right, calm down, calm down.

14:22.949 --> 14:24.124
It's o...
Everybody take it easy,

14:24.167 --> 14:25.255
everybody take a deep breath.

14:25.299 --> 14:26.822
You know, we're gonna
get through this, I-I think.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.128
Look, Kate, uh,
you two are clearly

14:28.171 --> 14:29.956
a little in
over your heads, here.

14:29.999 --> 14:32.045
Right? Yeah. You're never
gonna be able to rein in

14:32.088 --> 14:33.611
this particular group,
so I tell you what--

14:33.655 --> 14:36.136
I have some experience
running, uh,

14:36.179 --> 14:37.833
little educational
seminars like this,

14:37.877 --> 14:39.835
so why don't I take over
for a little bit?

14:39.879 --> 14:41.968
You guys, scoot. All right?
On your bikes.

14:45.362 --> 14:47.060
Here's a statistic for you:

14:47.103 --> 14:49.976
100% of men are capable
of being sexual harassers.

14:50.019 --> 14:51.760
And 100% of women

14:51.803 --> 14:54.502
are capable of being
sexually harassed.

14:54.545 --> 14:56.199
Now, am I saying that all men

14:56.243 --> 14:58.854
are sexual harassers?
No, no, no, no. No, no.

14:58.898 --> 15:00.421
Of course not. No.
Absolutely not. No.

15:00.464 --> 15:02.075
Yes, some men are, uh, well,

15:02.118 --> 15:03.554
they're-they're
sexual harassers,

15:03.598 --> 15:05.513
but they don't represent
all men, you know,

15:05.556 --> 15:07.080
just like all women
aren't represented

15:07.123 --> 15:09.082
by a few bad ones, you know?
Women like, uh...

15:09.125 --> 15:10.561
[dramatic music plays]

15:10.605 --> 15:12.999
You know, and of course...

15:13.042 --> 15:14.739
And then we got...

15:14.783 --> 15:16.437
Point is,

15:16.480 --> 15:19.527
that gender really doesn't have
anything to do with it.

15:19.570 --> 15:21.790
There's really only one thing
that determines

15:21.833 --> 15:23.879
whether a person will be accused
of sexual harassment,

15:23.923 --> 15:25.185
and that is...

15:25.228 --> 15:27.013
ugliness.

15:27.056 --> 15:29.363
-[all gasping]
-Let me explain.

15:29.406 --> 15:31.756
Now, see, here's a,
here's a graph of ugliness

15:31.800 --> 15:33.802
as it relates to time.

15:33.845 --> 15:35.673
Now, you see how the,
how the arrow plunges

15:35.717 --> 15:38.111
pretty steeply downward
as your ugliness increases.

15:38.154 --> 15:40.591
Now, I want you to imagine
a scenario for me.

15:40.635 --> 15:42.680
This man walks
into work one day,

15:42.724 --> 15:44.813
sees a woman, and says,
"I like your dress."

15:44.856 --> 15:48.034
Oh. Mildly sexual,
but innocuous enough, yeah.

15:48.077 --> 15:52.821
Now imagine the same sentence
spoken by this man.

15:52.864 --> 15:55.215
-[groans, gasps]
-Yeah.

15:55.258 --> 15:56.259
Suddenly,
you're very uncomfortable.

15:56.303 --> 15:58.609
We're all uncomfortable
just looking at him now.

15:58.653 --> 16:02.222
Because he's gross, he's ugly,
he's a little bit of a monster.

16:02.265 --> 16:04.702
Now, is it this man's fault
that he looks this way?

16:04.746 --> 16:07.488
No. He was, he was born
this way, but the point is,

16:07.531 --> 16:09.055
I know it's not myfault,
you know?

16:09.098 --> 16:10.926
Is it your fault?
I don't think so.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.493
It's certainly not the woman's
fault, you know?

16:12.536 --> 16:15.235
Point is, know your place,
monster man. Your time's up.

16:15.278 --> 16:16.279
[bell dings]

16:16.323 --> 16:17.628
Now, I know
what you're thinking.

16:17.672 --> 16:20.153
You're thinking,
"How do I know if I'm ugly?

16:20.196 --> 16:21.937
Well, if you're not sure,

16:21.981 --> 16:23.286
probably best to assume
that you are.

16:23.330 --> 16:25.375
Everyone in this room is.
I-I did a scan.

16:25.419 --> 16:26.942
Now here's the part
where you say,

16:26.986 --> 16:28.944
"But, Dennis, I can't be ugly,

16:28.988 --> 16:30.815
I'm rich."

16:30.859 --> 16:34.297
And, yes, money can offset
and reduce ugliness,

16:34.341 --> 16:36.734
but it actually
increases your risk.

16:36.778 --> 16:38.736
You see, a construction worker,
he can can catcall women

16:38.780 --> 16:40.303
all day long, right?
And he gets away with it

16:40.347 --> 16:44.090
'cause nobody gives a shit,
but a rich guy...

16:44.133 --> 16:46.092
-A rich guy's fun to take down.
-[clock ticking]

16:46.135 --> 16:47.093
Time's up.

16:47.136 --> 16:49.965
-[bell dings]
-"But, Dennis," you're saying,

16:50.009 --> 16:51.445
"I can't be ugly,
and-and it doesn't matter,

16:51.488 --> 16:52.968
because I'm gay."

16:53.012 --> 16:54.187
-[chuckles]
-Well, guess what, pal?

16:54.230 --> 16:55.884
You-you are ugly,

16:55.927 --> 16:57.103
and it doesn't matter how much

16:57.146 --> 16:59.105
you work out. It's never
gonna change that fact.

16:59.148 --> 17:01.324
You've also objectified
tons of men, including me.

17:01.368 --> 17:03.196
You know, you got to stop
kissing me, man.

17:03.239 --> 17:05.328
I don't want it. I don't want
you touching me at all.

17:05.372 --> 17:07.113
Okay, it's never gonna happen.
All right?

17:07.156 --> 17:09.071
Not willingly. Your time's up.

17:09.115 --> 17:10.681
[bell dings]

17:10.725 --> 17:14.337
"But Dennis, I can't be ugly.
I'm a hopeless romantic."

17:14.381 --> 17:16.470
-[clock ticking]
-But no, you're-you're not.

17:16.513 --> 17:18.472
Okay, you're-you're a sad,
pathetic wretch of a man,

17:18.515 --> 17:20.126
so desperate to be loved

17:20.169 --> 17:22.780
that you'll actually go rifling
through somebody's garbage.

17:22.824 --> 17:24.782
[chuckles]:
And there's nothing--

17:24.826 --> 17:28.134
nothing--more unattractive
than desperation.

17:28.177 --> 17:30.092
Yeah, so you te...
No, not him.

17:30.136 --> 17:31.093
No, talking about you. No.

17:31.137 --> 17:32.660
Not him, either.
Yeah, I am talking

17:32.703 --> 17:34.879
about y... You know what,
never mind. Your time's up.

17:34.923 --> 17:37.317
-[bell dings]
-"But Dennis...

17:37.360 --> 17:39.362
"I-I... See, I can't be ugly,
all right?

17:39.406 --> 17:40.668
I'm a woman."

17:40.711 --> 17:42.104
-[clock ticking]
-Well, no, women can be ugly,

17:42.148 --> 17:43.366
and you are one of them.

17:43.410 --> 17:45.151
One of the ugly ones.
You're lanky, and your hair's--

17:45.194 --> 17:47.805
well, it looks like a wig.
Yeah. What's going on?

17:47.849 --> 17:49.807
Is it a wig? Doesn't matter.
Your time's up.

17:49.851 --> 17:52.027
-[bell dings]
-But guys,

17:52.071 --> 17:53.594
I got some good news for you.

17:53.637 --> 17:56.249
Okay?
It's not a crime to be ugly.

17:56.292 --> 17:58.164
But you can't be ugly

17:58.207 --> 18:00.166
andsloppy.

18:00.209 --> 18:02.385
So, take me, for example.

18:02.429 --> 18:05.171
I'm neither. Yeah, you see that?

18:05.214 --> 18:08.391
That is 11% body fat. Now,
the only place you're gonna...

18:08.435 --> 18:10.350
-What year was that photo taken?
-No, no, no.

18:10.393 --> 18:11.960
Not taking questions
right now, Mac.

18:12.003 --> 18:13.266
So just... Yeah.

18:13.309 --> 18:15.181
Point is, I keep my body tight.

18:15.224 --> 18:18.401
But I also keep my life tight.

18:18.445 --> 18:21.187
I got the tapes.
I got the receipts.

18:21.230 --> 18:22.405
They're all time-stamped
and coded.

18:22.449 --> 18:24.190
After every encounter,
I received a text

18:24.233 --> 18:26.670
confirming each partner's
consent and enjoyment.

18:29.108 --> 18:30.413
Now, you may ask, "Well...

18:30.457 --> 18:33.286
would a woman really-really
text that, Dennis?"

18:33.329 --> 18:35.375
Their phones did.

18:38.117 --> 18:40.554
I got the documents to prove it,
so don't try coming at me.

18:40.597 --> 18:43.426
But some of you--

18:43.470 --> 18:45.733
you just haven't been
careful enough.

18:45.776 --> 18:49.389
So you're asking yourself, "What
can I do to save myself now?"

18:49.432 --> 18:51.434
You got to clean up your act.
Otherwise, you're going down,

18:51.478 --> 18:53.001
and you're gonna
take me down with you,

18:53.044 --> 18:54.307
and I ain't going down.

18:54.350 --> 18:56.961
You understand? I've been
telling you this for years,

18:57.005 --> 18:58.224
but you refused to listen.

18:58.267 --> 19:00.530
And so that's why I had to find
a way to make you listen,

19:00.574 --> 19:03.359
which is why Icreated
the Shitty Bar List.

19:03.403 --> 19:05.448
-[crowd murmuring]
-What?

19:05.492 --> 19:06.667
That's right.

19:06.710 --> 19:08.451
I made the spreadsheet,
I posted it online,

19:08.495 --> 19:10.323
and I even hired these two bozos
to host the seminar.

19:10.366 --> 19:11.715
Wait, youhired us?

19:13.152 --> 19:14.414
You're a monster.

19:14.457 --> 19:16.981
-[clock ticking]
-Oh, yeah? Prove it.

19:17.025 --> 19:19.549
[bell dings]

19:19.593 --> 19:21.682
Oh, wow!
I feel like we should clap.

19:21.725 --> 19:23.031
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

19:23.074 --> 19:24.380
-That was pretty good.
-That was awesome.

19:24.424 --> 19:26.469
Yeah. I'm gonna be honest,
I didn't follow most of it,

19:26.513 --> 19:28.689
-but so cool, man.
-Yeah.

19:28.732 --> 19:31.257
Pretty drastic move
to publicly expose us,

19:31.300 --> 19:33.433
but I see why you did it.

19:33.476 --> 19:35.565
Yeah, but it's true.
I mean, women are out to get us.

19:35.609 --> 19:37.132
Well, well, no, no.
Women are right.

19:37.176 --> 19:39.439
I mean, men are monsters.
We're constantly harassing them.

19:39.482 --> 19:41.136
I'm just saying
we need to be more careful

19:41.180 --> 19:42.485
so we don't get accused.

19:42.529 --> 19:44.139
And we should probably
stop harassing them.

19:44.183 --> 19:46.489
Uh, well, you know, I don't
know. One step at a time.

19:46.533 --> 19:47.708
We don't want the whole system
to collapse,

19:47.751 --> 19:49.362
-you know what I mean?
-Ease-ease into it.

19:49.405 --> 19:50.928
-It'd be chaotic. Yeah, yeah.
-Ease into it.
-Yeah.

19:50.972 --> 19:51.929
Yeah, yeah.
You guys want to go

19:51.973 --> 19:52.930
grab some margaritas
by the pool?

19:52.974 --> 19:54.497
-I do.
-Booze.

19:54.541 --> 19:55.716
-I'm ready for some booze.
-DEE: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

19:55.759 --> 19:57.021
-Let's go.
-Yeah.
-Me, too.

19:57.065 --> 19:58.284
-Oh!
-[all laugh]

19:58.327 --> 20:00.590
-Oh, "MeToo."
-Very good.

20:00.634 --> 20:03.376
-That's great.
-Very good, and for a woman,
a good joke.

20:03.419 --> 20:05.378
Hey, you guys think
that Alan guy's got a big dick?

20:05.421 --> 20:06.292
-DENNIS: Oh, yeah.
-Huge.

20:06.335 --> 20:08.076
I saw it in the bathroom.
I sought it out.
