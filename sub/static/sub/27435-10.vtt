no constitutional right

08:23.410 --> 08:25.662

39:33.190 --> 39:34.361
I'll let her know.

39:35.020 --> 39:36.499
[DOOR OPENS]

39:42.850 --> 39:44.670
You know,
if you had told me
what you were up to,

39:44.730 --> 39:47.119
I wouldn't have shown up
and gotten in the way.

39:47.160 --> 39:49.208
Tell me about
the Cryptobanker.

39:49.250 --> 39:51.901
Not that it matters now,
but we have him in custody.

39:51.950 --> 39:53.679
He did business in Cairo

39:53.730 --> 39:56.039
with a man who_ can
unlock the conspIracy.

39:56.080 --> 39:57.991
What good will that do?
You pleaded guilty.

39:59.700 --> 40:01.474
a transaction
report between them.

40:01.520 --> 40:03.909
Get it.
Show it to him.

40:03.960 --> 40:06.611
Get him to tell you
where he sent
the laundered money.

40:06.660 --> 40:09.003
An account number.
An address.

40:09.050 --> 40:11.098
For the man in Cairo.

40:11.140 --> 40:13.608
Everything rests
on finding him.

40:16.890 --> 40:21.406
What you said in your profile.
It was very kind.

40:24.370 --> 40:26.326
Let's hope
the jury is, too.

40:26.380 --> 40:30.282
Twisted like a wicked tree

40:30.340 --> 40:33.468
La,la,la,la

40:33.510 --> 40:37.389
You're runnin'
from those words you speak

40:37.430 --> 40:40.809
La,la,la,la

40:40.870 --> 40:43.168
They gonna hunt you down...

40:43.220 --> 40:46.565
This is a transaction report
generated by a business deal

40:46.610 --> 40:48.566
between you
and a man in Cairo.

40:48.620 --> 40:51.703
I'm gonna
ask you one question
about this report.

40:51.750 --> 40:53.741
Answer it honestly
and I'll tell Main Justice

40:53.790 --> 40:56.224
you provided the FBI
with vital intel.

40:56.270 --> 40:57.965
I'm giving you a gift.

40:58.020 --> 41:00.181
I hope you're smart enough
to take it.

41:00.240 --> 41:03.755
Madam Foreperson,
has the jury
reached a verdict?

41:03.800 --> 41:05.495
We have, Your Honor.

41:05.550 --> 41:07.199
I _never_know
a c|Ient's IdentIty.

41:07.240 --> 41:08.969
This report indicates
you laundered

41:09.030 --> 41:10.895
$5 million worth
of Bitcoin for him.

41:10.940 --> 41:12.544
So you may not know
his identity,

41:12.600 --> 41:14.374
but you know
where you sent him his money.

41:14.420 --> 41:16.206
And that's my question.

41:16.250 --> 41:18.901
His money...
Where did you send it to him?

41:18.950 --> 41:21.339
I can't tell you that
because I don't know.

41:21.390 --> 41:23.426
I didn't send it to him.

41:23.480 --> 41:27.826
I have to
find the man in Cairo.

41:27.870 --> 41:29.565
WILKINS: Mr. Reddington,
please stand.

41:30.830 --> 41:33.560
Madam Foreperson,
does the jury believe

41:33.620 --> 41:36.180
the defendant deserves
the death penalty?

41:37.880 --> 41:38.869
Yes.

41:41.450 --> 41:43.702
WILKINS: Are there any
mitigating circumstances?

41:44.020 --> 41:46.147
No.

41:46.190 --> 41:48.533
Your Honor
I ask you to set

41:48.590 --> 41:51.195
the jury's
recommendation aside.

41:51.240 --> 41:53.708
It was your recommendation
to them.

41:54.810 --> 41:56.766
A moment of madness.

41:56.810 --> 41:58.892
Or a hope that
you would have escaped by now?

41:58.950 --> 42:01.987
Without hope,
one is hopeless.

42:02.040 --> 42:05.908
I'm going to accept
the jury's recommendation.

42:05.950 --> 42:09.249
Based on the crimes
you've pleaded guilty to,

42:09.300 --> 42:11.825
you've not only
lost your right
to live as a free man,

42:11.870 --> 42:14.600
but under the laws
of the United States,

42:14.660 --> 42:16.958
you have lost your right
to live at all.
