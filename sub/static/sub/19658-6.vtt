WEBVTT

00:01.211 --> 00:04.865
Arankhi.
Your passport to paradise.

00:06.816 --> 00:11.313
And here we are on yet another
krutackin' desert planet!

00:11.980 --> 00:14.998
Quill, how come we never wind
up on lush tropical resorts,

00:15.033 --> 00:17.261
where they serve ya, you know,
those little fruit drinks

00:17.286 --> 00:19.268
with the paper umbrellas, huh?

00:19.304 --> 00:20.251
Come on, Rocket.

00:20.276 --> 00:23.120
Just be glad that searching
Yondu's hideouts finally paid off.

00:23.741 --> 00:25.499
There's his space pod!

00:26.003 --> 00:28.570
And there's
the sarcophagus.

00:28.605 --> 00:32.249
- I have a bad feeling about this.
- No. No, no, no. New rule.

00:32.284 --> 00:35.676
Nobody's allowed to have bad
feelings or be too old for this,

00:35.712 --> 00:38.592
and definitely, nobody says,
"Things can't get any worse."

00:40.716 --> 00:43.651
Even though that's a Ravager ship,
and they want to blow us up.

00:44.012 --> 00:47.702
All right, look. We got the
sarcophagus fair and square.

00:51.253 --> 00:54.896
<i> The Ravagers said I would
find my father's sarcophagus here.</i>

00:54.921 --> 00:58.793
<i>They didn't mention I'd get
to destroy my sister as well.</i>

00:59.052 --> 01:00.052
Nebula.

01:00.077 --> 01:01.452
So what?

01:01.487 --> 01:04.858
Without all her cyborg stuff,
Quill could take her down.

01:05.910 --> 01:06.884
Wait.

01:11.180 --> 01:14.502
Never underestimate
a daughter of Thanos.

01:15.844 --> 01:18.629
<i>Especially when she's in battle armor.</i>

01:18.671 --> 01:20.258
Uh...

01:35.731 --> 01:37.618
When did Nebula get an upgrade?

01:37.643 --> 01:40.899
Maybe you should ask her. You know,
when she stops shooting at us!

01:40.924 --> 01:44.539
Load the sarcophagus onto the ship.
I will deal with Nebula.

01:50.828 --> 01:53.047
Anybody else got a plan?

01:57.227 --> 01:59.544
That sarcophagus belonged to Thanos.

01:59.569 --> 02:02.275
By all rights, it's mine!

02:02.300 --> 02:04.484
When she gets close enough, I'm
gonna open the sarcophagus.

02:04.509 --> 02:06.644
Boom! No more Nebula.

02:07.888 --> 02:12.215
No. You saw what it did to the High
Evolutionary. You can't vaporize my sister.

02:13.360 --> 02:14.691
Watch me.

02:16.103 --> 02:18.773
You want this so bad? Then take it!

02:19.110 --> 02:21.676
Huh? Take it! Take it!

02:21.701 --> 02:22.751
D'oh!

02:32.687 --> 02:34.215
- Oh!
- Don't touch them!

02:34.240 --> 02:37.511
If Thanos hid these artifacts,
they must be incredibly dangerous.

02:37.533 --> 02:39.681
Yeah? And I'm gonna make them
dangerous to Nebula!

02:39.716 --> 02:41.254
Quit it!

02:41.279 --> 02:42.845
You don't even know what they do.

02:42.870 --> 02:45.116
Whatever they do,
they can't make things any...

02:45.141 --> 02:47.802
Oh. See? You almost
made me say it.

02:48.469 --> 02:51.233
Well, guess it's
up to us... Again.

02:51.258 --> 02:52.890
I am Groot!

02:56.030 --> 02:58.427
That the best you got, furless?

02:59.026 --> 03:02.045
You couldn't handle
my best, rodent!

03:09.139 --> 03:10.958
<i> No!</i>

03:11.646 --> 03:12.990
Ha! Now I have you!

03:15.088 --> 03:17.882
Sorry, Nebs.
I'm shutting you down.

03:22.627 --> 03:24.283
No!

03:27.305 --> 03:30.184
Come on. Reboot. Reboot!

03:31.165 --> 03:33.188
You are freakishly strong.

03:55.036 --> 03:58.839
Oh, sister, you are making
this way too easy.

04:02.830 --> 04:06.276
All right. Desperate times,
desperate measures.

04:12.215 --> 04:12.960
Huh?

04:15.370 --> 04:16.576
Huh?

05:04.589 --> 05:06.707
Oh, this can't be good.

05:06.981 --> 05:08.082
<i> No!</i>

05:08.107 --> 05:11.529
That helmet is meant
for a true daughter of Thanos!

05:28.274 --> 05:29.437
I can't touch the helmet,

05:29.462 --> 05:32.368
but she gets to fly around and shoot
lasers out of her hands?

05:32.392 --> 05:34.935
Something's wrong, Quill.
That ain't Gamora.

06:07.480 --> 06:08.385
Huh?

06:18.170 --> 06:19.704
Gamora, stop!

06:19.729 --> 06:22.489
A minute ago, you were trying
to save your sister's life.

06:22.514 --> 06:24.161
Now you're gonna tear her apart?

06:24.186 --> 06:26.215
I've seen this kind of rage before.

06:26.240 --> 06:28.854
Flarg, I've lived
this kind of rage before.

06:33.120 --> 06:33.655
Oh.

06:33.680 --> 06:35.905
You are not free to go.

06:39.941 --> 06:41.225
Gamora...

06:41.260 --> 06:42.990
I'm not taking off the helmet.

06:43.015 --> 06:46.606
Look, I get it. When I wore that
Asgardian armor, the power...

06:46.631 --> 06:49.226
Not power. Information.

06:50.127 --> 06:51.701
What kind of information?

06:51.737 --> 06:54.250
Something else was inside
the sarcophagus.

06:54.275 --> 06:58.876
The thing that vaporized the High
Evolutionary. <i>Some sort of cocoon.</i>

07:00.779 --> 07:03.788
Whatever it is, it's long gone now.

07:04.557 --> 07:08.187
The Ravagers said Yondu was selling
the sarcophagus to the Believers.

07:08.212 --> 07:11.639
Obviously, they got here first,
took what they wanted, and left.

07:11.674 --> 07:14.141
Too slow, as always, dear sister.

07:14.176 --> 07:18.062
I don't know if it's the helmet,  but
something wants me to find that cocoon.

07:18.087 --> 07:19.281
To protect it.

07:19.306 --> 07:23.014
We can't leave that kind to of power
in the hands of crazed fanatics.

07:23.039 --> 07:27.070
Says the lady taking orders
from a magic hat.

07:27.077 --> 07:29.570
- I am Groot!
- Groot's right.

07:29.595 --> 07:31.490
You gotta get rid
of that krutackin' helmet

07:31.515 --> 07:33.538
before it turns your
brains to applesauce!

07:33.563 --> 07:37.920
There's a difference between crazy
prophecies and actual visions.

07:37.951 --> 07:40.766
My visions led us to the
Cosmic Seed, remember?

07:40.791 --> 07:44.672
Yeah, after they led us around
in circles for six months.

07:44.708 --> 07:47.350
If your father, Thanos,
prized the helmet so,

07:47.385 --> 07:50.144
then nothing good can come of it.
We should destroy it.

07:50.169 --> 07:54.428
If you ask me, that artifact has
already warped my sister's mind.

07:54.453 --> 07:58.894
But then again, a daughter of
Thanos will do anything for power.

08:00.212 --> 08:01.696
Not this one.

08:01.721 --> 08:03.200
But that still doesn't change the fact

08:03.225 --> 08:06.232
that we need to get the cocoon
away from the Believers.

08:09.660 --> 08:12.717
- Why are we bringing her along?
- So we can keep an eye on her.

08:12.742 --> 08:16.425
"Keep your enemies closer,"
as some guy said one time.

08:16.450 --> 08:19.210
That guy was me, just a minute ago.

08:19.235 --> 08:21.821
Besides, there's gotta be
a bounty on her somewhere.

08:21.846 --> 08:24.210
Make sure she don't try nothing.

08:24.235 --> 08:26.649
I am Groot.

08:26.835 --> 08:29.450
Okay, you're the one with
the visions this time around.

08:29.475 --> 08:30.756
Where are we going?

08:30.781 --> 08:33.374
All I got was a flood
of images and sensations.

08:33.399 --> 08:35.520
It's not like the helmet drew me a map.

08:35.544 --> 08:36.519
No problem.

08:36.544 --> 08:40.610
Avoiding the Believers is d'ast
impossible, but finding them is easy.

08:40.635 --> 08:41.961
Drax?

08:42.649 --> 08:44.957
<i>Join the Believers
at this location.</i>

08:44.992 --> 08:48.785
Great! Planet
Tashlu, a five-star resort,

08:48.820 --> 08:51.747
and we can't take five
minutes to enjoy it!

08:51.783 --> 08:53.908
Just one receptionist up front.

08:53.943 --> 08:56.658
Time to work
the ol' Star-Lord magic.

08:59.506 --> 09:05.494
Hi. I'm the repairman, here to fix
the thing that is not working.

09:05.519 --> 09:09.876
All righty. I'll call security
to walk you back there.

09:10.563 --> 09:15.122
I was kind of hoping you
could show me the way.

09:15.154 --> 09:21.358
I am really not supposed to leave
the desk, but it is a slow night.

09:26.250 --> 09:28.767
I do not know what they see in him.

09:28.802 --> 09:31.284
Perhaps it is his distinctive odor.

09:31.382 --> 09:34.265
Nothing about any
cocoon in the comm system.

09:34.290 --> 09:36.093
We gotta find an office or something.

09:36.961 --> 09:40.003
I should tell you,
I've been hurt before.

09:40.038 --> 09:42.774
I had a hard time
learning to trust again.

09:42.799 --> 09:45.216
But thanks to my training here,

09:45.241 --> 09:48.747
I believe I can see people
for who they really are.

09:52.603 --> 09:56.483
- It's you!
- What? No, it's not!

09:56.508 --> 10:00.149
You're one of the Unbelievers
who attacked our flagship!

10:02.104 --> 10:06.289
Okay. I usually don't have this effect
on women until after the first date!

10:08.701 --> 10:10.248
I am Groot.

10:10.753 --> 10:12.387
Nothing in here neither.

10:12.938 --> 10:14.338
Nor here.

10:16.367 --> 10:18.273
Oh, anger issues!

10:22.207 --> 10:26.215
- Quill, what did you do?
- Nothing. I swear.

10:26.240 --> 10:27.828
Halt, Unbelievers!

10:27.853 --> 10:30.333
"Unbelievers"?
I thought we were doubters.

10:30.358 --> 10:32.733
So we got an upgrade.
What's the difference?

10:34.414 --> 10:37.681
The difference is Unbelievers
are terminated on sight.

10:42.669 --> 10:44.391
I am Groot!

10:44.415 --> 10:46.734
You sure are.
Rocket, open the door!

10:46.767 --> 10:48.865
I thought you'd never ask.

10:53.704 --> 10:55.464
Groot, close the door!

10:56.822 --> 10:59.351
Great. We're trapped
in a supply closet!

10:59.376 --> 11:01.263
Beats being trapped in a hallway!

11:03.272 --> 11:06.759
Funny how your "friends" didn't
put up much of an argument

11:06.784 --> 11:08.738
when you said you were staying behind.

11:11.305 --> 11:13.245
They respect my decisions.

11:14.030 --> 11:16.352
And someone had to keep an eye on you.

11:16.377 --> 11:19.781
Or maybe they didn't really
want you on the mission.

11:19.806 --> 11:22.380
Maybe they don't trust you.

11:22.405 --> 11:25.831
No matter how much you try to make
up for the sins of your past,

11:25.836 --> 11:29.805
you'll always be
a daughter of Thanos to them.

11:30.283 --> 11:33.896
That cocoon is our rightful
inheritance, sister.

11:34.029 --> 11:36.170
Not that you'd know what to
do with that kind of power.

11:36.349 --> 11:39.069
Your conscience makes you weak.

11:39.854 --> 11:41.679
<i> Hey, Gamora?</i>

11:41.704 --> 11:44.513
<i>Um, you know that
super-stealthy recon mission</i>

11:44.538 --> 11:46.359
<i>that the Believers were
never gonna find out about?</i>

11:46.384 --> 11:48.699
<i>It's not going well.</i>

11:48.728 --> 11:54.336
Ooh, rescue your friends,
or keep your sister captive?

11:54.999 --> 11:57.612
Which one will you choose?

12:03.149 --> 12:05.283
All of the above.

12:10.931 --> 12:14.334
I believe I can access
the supply closet.

12:17.222 --> 12:19.121
I am Groot!

12:19.146 --> 12:21.769
Rocket, can you cut through
the outer wall or not?

12:22.119 --> 12:23.634
I'm working on it.

12:23.670 --> 12:26.884
Who the heck builds
a triple-reinforced day spa?

12:36.649 --> 12:38.943
Where is the cocoon?

12:38.968 --> 12:42.810
I... I don't... On
the flagship, orbiting Panoris.

12:42.835 --> 12:44.541
That's all I know. I swear!

12:44.560 --> 12:46.935
Gamora! Put him down.

12:46.960 --> 12:50.338
We can't leave anyone alive
to warn the other Believers.

12:50.355 --> 12:51.990
I am Groot!

12:54.706 --> 13:00.569
- Groot!
- I... am... Groot.

13:00.631 --> 13:01.840
Aah!

13:02.884 --> 13:07.669
Lady, you just crossed
the krutackin' line.

13:07.694 --> 13:11.182
If we're not careful, none of
us will make it out of here.

13:11.207 --> 13:14.519
You don't need to do this. We can
knock out their communications.

13:14.544 --> 13:15.920
I trust you, G.

13:15.945 --> 13:17.570
But you need to trust me.

13:17.989 --> 13:21.257
Take... the helmet... off.

13:28.832 --> 13:30.626
See? Much better.

13:31.102 --> 13:33.282
Gamora? Gamora!

13:41.830 --> 13:43.758
What happened?

13:44.728 --> 13:46.766
You honestly can't remember?

13:47.994 --> 13:49.470
Groot! Is he...

13:49.495 --> 13:52.507
He's gonna be okay.
But you hurt him pretty bad.

13:52.532 --> 13:55.740
I told you you couldn't handle
that kind of power.

13:55.765 --> 13:58.397
- It was an accident.
- It was the helmet.

13:58.422 --> 14:01.935
We have to lock this thing up before
it destroys you or destroys one of us.

14:02.233 --> 14:03.784
What about the cocoon?

14:03.809 --> 14:07.065
The plan hasn't changed. Rocket's
flying us to the Believer flagship.

14:08.837 --> 14:10.257
Weak.

14:14.948 --> 14:17.128
We're gonna be in
sensor range in a few minutes.

14:17.153 --> 14:20.198
If you've got a plan, now would
be the time to share it.

14:20.223 --> 14:22.282
I figured we'd do what we always do.

14:22.307 --> 14:25.160
Oh, you mean go in clueless and
nearly get our tails shot off?

14:25.185 --> 14:28.295
Uh-oh. Priority
call from Nova Prime.

14:28.320 --> 14:31.899
Nova Prime! What can the Guardians
of the Galaxy do for you today?

14:31.970 --> 14:35.959
<i>We picked up an unusual Nova
Force signature on planet Tashlu</i>

14:35.984 --> 14:38.215
<i>and traced it back to your ship.</i>

14:38.504 --> 14:41.404
Weird. Uh, hey, did I tell
you we captured Nebula?

14:41.440 --> 14:43.393
How high is the bounty on her now, huh?
Seven thou?

14:43.418 --> 14:45.029
<i>Let's cut to the chase, Quill.</i>

14:45.054 --> 14:47.848
<i>You have something extremely
dangerous in your possession.</i>

14:47.873 --> 14:50.989
<i>The Nova Centurion helmets
were used by an elite squad</i>

14:51.024 --> 14:52.632
<i>in the early days of the Corps.</i>

14:52.668 --> 14:54.809
Wow. That's a really cool story.

14:54.840 --> 14:57.374
We haven't found any helmets like
that, but, you know, if we do...

14:57.399 --> 15:00.773
<i>Based on the energy signature, that
helmet has been tampered with.</i>

15:00.798 --> 15:03.649
<i>It drains the life energy
from the user.</i>

15:03.674 --> 15:07.549
- Uh, how much life energy we talkin'?
- <i>All of it.</i>

15:11.611 --> 15:14.124
I think the
Believers know we're here.

15:23.730 --> 15:26.900
- <i>Quill, what's going...</i>
- Sorry, Prime. Gotta go.

15:26.935 --> 15:28.334
What is it? Tractor beam?

15:28.370 --> 15:30.849
Not exactly. Mantis!

15:30.874 --> 15:33.601
<i>Our brethren on Tashlu
told us you would be coming.</i>

15:33.626 --> 15:37.983
<i>And now, like all Unbelievers,
you will be crushed.</i>

15:40.273 --> 15:43.251
Hate to say it, but I
kind of believe her!

15:50.351 --> 15:52.121
Rocket, get us outta here.

15:52.146 --> 15:55.045
Before that Belief energy bubble
puts the squeeze on us for good!

15:55.070 --> 15:56.975
Diverting all power to main thrusters.

15:58.280 --> 16:00.626
It's no good.
We need more than "all power."

16:00.651 --> 16:03.492
There's too much pressure on the hull.
It's gonna crack!

16:07.643 --> 16:09.549
I can't escape the energy field!

16:09.574 --> 16:12.980
Drax the Destroyer does not escape.
He fights!

16:17.005 --> 16:18.458
The flagship is well shielded.

16:18.483 --> 16:20.121
Our weapons are useless.

16:20.146 --> 16:21.398
What's happening?

16:21.423 --> 16:25.277
The Believers on Tashlu told the flagship
we were coming. They're crushing the ship.

16:25.302 --> 16:28.475
Hey, don't look at me. When I wreck
a comm system, it stays wrecked.

16:28.500 --> 16:30.208
Must've had a backup or something.

16:32.537 --> 16:35.358
You left witnesses alive?

16:35.383 --> 16:37.619
Did you learn nothing from Father?

16:37.664 --> 16:39.604
You have to let me use the helmet.

16:39.629 --> 16:40.975
But it might destroy you.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.776
Or you might destroy us.

16:42.801 --> 16:44.834
I am the one who destroys!

16:44.859 --> 16:48.291
I will leap out the airlock and
punch my way inside the flagship.

16:48.625 --> 16:50.528
Yeah, I don't think
that's gonna work.

16:50.560 --> 16:52.243
Punching always works.

16:52.279 --> 16:54.152
No! Blowing
things up always works!

16:54.177 --> 16:55.743
It did not work for me!

16:55.768 --> 16:58.201
Which is why
we need the helmet.

16:59.878 --> 17:01.524
Yeah, I don't remember
you getting a vote.

17:08.275 --> 17:10.797
Okay, I'm trusting you on this.

17:31.168 --> 17:33.212
The Unbelievers
are at the door!

17:33.237 --> 17:35.416
We must act while there's still time.

17:35.441 --> 17:38.447
I believe we can open the cocoon!

17:38.887 --> 17:41.784
She did not wait for us.
That is very inconsiderate.

17:43.927 --> 17:47.015
- Gamora!
- I'm not hurting them, Quill.

17:47.051 --> 17:49.348
But I must protect the cocoon.

17:49.997 --> 17:51.307
Time is running out.

17:51.332 --> 17:53.820
Divert all Belief energy to the cocoon!

17:53.845 --> 17:56.445
Engines, life support, everything!

17:56.470 --> 18:00.358
I believe we will open the cocoon!

18:00.837 --> 18:05.268
I believe we
will open the cocoon!

18:07.551 --> 18:11.111
Guys, I think they cut the power!
This bird's going down!

18:11.136 --> 18:13.015
Groot, can you hear me, buddy?

18:13.040 --> 18:16.394
<i>The flagship's crashing!</i>
<i>You gotta undock the</i> Milano!

18:16.419 --> 18:17.744
<i>Groot!</i>

18:19.616 --> 18:22.184
The Golden Age is nearly upon us.

18:22.209 --> 18:23.335
No!

18:23.370 --> 18:27.014
Unbelievers! Destroy them!

18:27.039 --> 18:29.641
We ain't got time for this.
The ship's gonna go splat.

18:29.666 --> 18:31.538
I don't think they care.

18:33.806 --> 18:35.666
You are too late, Unbeliever.

18:35.691 --> 18:38.801
I believe nothing can stop
the cocoon from opening.

18:44.673 --> 18:47.227
Come on! Close!

18:47.269 --> 18:49.528
Did you forget about me, sister?

18:49.563 --> 18:50.848
Nebula!

18:52.068 --> 18:53.217
Don't!

19:04.783 --> 19:06.155
Gamora!

19:08.277 --> 19:12.616
I knew you didn't have
what it takes, sister dear.

19:18.589 --> 19:21.361
Quill, the helmet
told me what I have to do.

19:21.386 --> 19:24.505
You must never let
the cocoon be opened, ever!

19:24.530 --> 19:26.071
I'm trusting you on this.

19:26.096 --> 19:29.565
- Wait. What are you gonna do?
- What's necessary.

19:42.717 --> 19:44.862
No! Gamora!

19:47.033 --> 19:51.794
<i>Warning. Belief batteries
depleted. Backup power system failure.</i>

19:52.560 --> 19:54.488
Quill, we gotta get outta here.

19:54.513 --> 19:57.333
Gamora trusted me.
I'm not gonna let her down.

19:57.358 --> 19:58.736
Hurry, Quill.

20:00.147 --> 20:05.849
Everyone, you must believe.
Believe we will survive this!

20:25.100 --> 20:31.482
Yes, my friends, all things
are possible if only you believe!

20:35.284 --> 20:37.970
Yondu's transport pod was
empty, except for this helmet,

20:37.995 --> 20:40.842
which we totally found after you
mentioned it and not before.

20:40.867 --> 20:42.822
I see. And what about Nebula?

20:42.847 --> 20:45.772
She escaped.
She is very deceptive.

20:49.684 --> 20:50.906
What happened to him?

20:50.931 --> 20:52.370
Cooking accident.

20:52.395 --> 20:55.261
I keep telling him to use oven mitts.

20:55.875 --> 20:58.753
Very well.
Whatever really happened,

20:58.778 --> 21:03.071
we thank you for bringing this dangerous
artifact to the proper authorities.

21:03.225 --> 21:04.573
Eventually.

21:07.067 --> 21:10.355
Why did you not tell Nova Prime
about the wristbands or the cocoon?

21:10.719 --> 21:13.136
Because Gamora's
still out there somewhere.

21:13.161 --> 21:15.113
And we're gonna get her back.

21:20.447 --> 21:21.877
Where am I?

21:21.902 --> 21:24.140
You mean
"where are we," sister.

21:26.795 --> 21:31.486
But if the High Evolutionary's here,
then it's nowhere good.
