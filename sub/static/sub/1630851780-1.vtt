WEBVTT

01:03.630 --> 01:04.731
Are you sure?

01:06.166 --> 01:08.034
What's the worst thing
that can happen?

02:11.064 --> 02:12.432
I'm tired already.

02:14.134 --> 02:15.401
What's up, man?

02:16.002 --> 02:17.570
We've already paid
the bribe this week.

02:17.637 --> 02:20.473
I'm not a cop.
I just want to talk.

02:21.608 --> 02:23.643
If you want to buy something,
go to Jamelão's store.

02:24.777 --> 02:25.879
I don't want to buy anything.

02:26.579 --> 02:27.847
Look at that.

02:27.914 --> 02:29.015
Calm down.

02:37.590 --> 02:39.526
Check it out.
She looks like you.

02:40.493 --> 02:41.628
She's identical!

02:44.030 --> 02:45.131
Who is that?

02:46.166 --> 02:47.534
This is Sofia.

02:49.536 --> 02:52.005
She has a birthmark on her arm.

02:52.438 --> 02:53.740
-You see that?
-Yes.

02:54.140 --> 02:55.275
What do you want?

02:55.341 --> 02:56.576
Do you have one like this?

02:56.876 --> 02:58.611
What do I have to do with it?

02:58.678 --> 02:59.746
What's the big deal?

02:59.812 --> 03:01.514
-Let me see.
-I won't show you.

03:01.581 --> 03:02.815
Just show me your arm.

03:02.882 --> 03:04.651
Are you crazy?
I don't have a birthmark.

03:05.752 --> 03:07.787
There's nothing here! Nothing!

03:13.493 --> 03:14.727
I'll get you!

03:19.732 --> 03:20.934
Drop it!

04:01.074 --> 04:04.177
EPISODE: ROBERTA AND MARCELLA

04:20.960 --> 04:22.795
Calm down, stay still.

04:24.163 --> 04:25.565
It hurts.

04:31.004 --> 04:32.672
-Edith, stop.
-Calm down.

04:35.775 --> 04:36.876
Raul?

04:37.810 --> 04:38.878
Raul Fagnani?

04:39.479 --> 04:40.813
Yes. And you are...?

04:41.581 --> 04:43.616
Sorry. I'm Augusto.

04:44.684 --> 04:45.852
I need your help.

04:46.586 --> 04:48.121
My daughter...

04:48.921 --> 04:51.991
She is everything to me.
If I lose her, I'm finished.

04:52.725 --> 04:55.795
-Marcella...
-Calm down. Breathe.

04:56.829 --> 04:58.765
Breathe. Tell me what happened.

04:59.766 --> 05:01.901
My daughter and my ex-wife
disappeared.

05:02.568 --> 05:06.873
Their house is empty
and their cell phones are off.

05:06.939 --> 05:09.008
I see. And how long has it been?

05:12.045 --> 05:13.579
About four hours.

05:16.182 --> 05:17.483
Did you call the police?

05:21.120 --> 05:22.221
It's alright.

05:23.756 --> 05:26.092
-Come with me.
-They told me you're the best.

05:27.060 --> 05:28.695
Help me find my daughter.

05:29.228 --> 05:30.530
Come with me.

05:31.931 --> 05:33.032
How old is she?

05:33.800 --> 05:34.901
She's nine years old.

05:36.436 --> 05:38.037
Did you go to her school?

05:38.104 --> 05:39.238
Yes.

05:39.706 --> 05:43.776
Apparently my ex, Roberta,
picked her up earlier.

05:44.844 --> 05:46.746
Right. And...

05:50.717 --> 05:51.918
By car or on foot?

05:54.687 --> 05:56.189
By car.

05:56.255 --> 05:58.725
She kept the truck
in the divorce.

05:59.692 --> 06:02.028
Waldir, write down
the license plate and the model,

06:02.095 --> 06:03.696
the first step
is to find the car.

06:03.763 --> 06:05.898
The car must be close.
There's always some trail.

06:06.766 --> 06:10.937
Do they have any relatives
who can provide information?

06:11.571 --> 06:14.140
No. Just an aunt who's now dead.

06:14.207 --> 06:16.075
Me and Marcella
are her only family.

06:16.709 --> 06:19.612
-Does the truck have a tracker?
-Yes. Of course.

06:20.012 --> 06:24.016
Tell Tai the company name
and tracker code.

06:25.518 --> 06:27.653
Does your daughter
have any birthmarks?

06:27.720 --> 06:29.756
-Scars, tattoo?
-No.

06:29.822 --> 06:31.657
I will need
a recent photo of her.

06:32.024 --> 06:34.093
The first 24 hours
are the most important.

06:34.694 --> 06:37.430
If you remember something,
even if it seems irrelevant,

06:38.564 --> 06:39.899
call Raul.

06:40.199 --> 06:41.501
Thank you, Raul.

06:42.668 --> 06:45.138
Tai. Locate their car.

07:25.044 --> 07:26.479
Getting old sucks.

07:28.681 --> 07:30.683
My mother drove faster than you.

07:32.018 --> 07:33.486
And her car was a Del Rey.

07:34.654 --> 07:35.788
Did she?

07:38.891 --> 07:40.460
You guys are adorable.

07:40.827 --> 07:43.162
Raul, pay attention. She took
the exit next to Raposo.

07:43.229 --> 07:44.764
Right in front of you.

07:50.803 --> 07:53.773
Looking for a pickup truck.
Near the road.

07:53.840 --> 07:56.542
You are close.
The car stopped at a farm.

07:57.610 --> 07:59.445
There. There. Stop. It's there.

08:15.094 --> 08:16.395
The key is in there.

08:41.754 --> 08:43.656
Why would anyone
leave a car like this?

08:44.490 --> 08:45.558
I know I wouldn't.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.661
Someone cornered the car,
kidnapped them both,

08:48.728 --> 08:50.496
and left the mess behind.

08:53.966 --> 08:56.035
-What is that, Raul?
-Trick or treat.

08:57.036 --> 08:58.971
There's no dent in this car.

08:59.972 --> 09:02.174
Let's go.
We can't draw attention.

09:02.542 --> 09:04.043
Our client wants discretion.

09:04.110 --> 09:05.611
Let's go. You drive the truck.

09:06.145 --> 09:07.980
-What about the dog?
-What about him?

09:08.748 --> 09:10.082
Do I leave the dog here?

09:13.553 --> 09:14.854
Goddamn it.

09:18.190 --> 09:19.592
Come with me.

09:19.659 --> 09:22.995
Calm down. Calm down.
Waldir will take care of you.

09:41.647 --> 09:42.748
Damn, Waldir!

09:43.849 --> 09:44.984
-Here, Raul.
-Great.

09:48.588 --> 09:49.789
Is everything there?

09:50.623 --> 09:51.624
Almost.

09:53.626 --> 09:54.760
Here. Here.

09:55.428 --> 09:56.529
Here, there you go.

09:57.763 --> 09:59.065
-How cute!
-I'm starving!

09:59.131 --> 10:01.534
It's dried apple, put it back.

10:02.134 --> 10:03.469
Gross.

10:06.038 --> 10:08.474
NUMBER OF MISSING PEOPLE
RISE IN SAO PAULO

10:08.541 --> 10:10.109
MISSING

10:10.176 --> 10:12.111
ONE PERSON DISAPPEARS
EVERY TWO MINUTES IN BRAZIL

10:13.946 --> 10:15.481
Hey!

10:15.548 --> 10:16.649
Listen.

10:17.149 --> 10:19.151
Roberta picked up
Marcella from school.

10:19.218 --> 10:20.753
They left in a hurry.

10:20.820 --> 10:22.788
We found the car in this area.

10:23.222 --> 10:26.092
Did you find any other
information about Roberta?

10:26.158 --> 10:28.494
She doesn't post photos,
she isn't on social media.

10:28.561 --> 10:30.696
-What kind of person is that?
-A shy person.

10:30.763 --> 10:32.465
Or maybe she has
something to hide.

10:33.132 --> 10:36.569
Waldir, search
the hospitals in the area.

10:36.636 --> 10:37.870
And call the morgue.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.673
Damn... You. Come here.

10:41.741 --> 10:43.075
You stay here.

10:43.142 --> 10:45.811
You're not leaving.
You stay here.

10:48.547 --> 10:50.750
Raul. The girl is here.

10:51.250 --> 10:54.086
-What girl?
-The journalist.

10:54.153 --> 10:56.088
-Edith...
-No, Raul.

10:56.155 --> 10:58.958
The agency needs advertising.

10:59.025 --> 11:03.029
It's no use being the best
if we can't say we're the best.

11:03.095 --> 11:04.196
Hi.

11:04.563 --> 11:07.667
I am Maria Júlia Buarque.
From the National Gazette.

11:07.733 --> 11:10.503
Sorry, I'm working on a case.

11:10.569 --> 11:11.837
Can I go with you?

11:12.538 --> 11:15.274
I can't write about
whereabouts investigation

11:15.341 --> 11:16.442
if I don't know how it works.

11:17.143 --> 11:20.246
"Missing person" investigation,
not "whereabouts".

11:20.513 --> 11:22.682
-Missing person investigation.
-Yes. I've gotta go.

11:22.748 --> 11:24.650
I'm learning new things already!

11:42.702 --> 11:44.036
Do you prefer to stay here?

11:53.813 --> 11:57.750
Go to Marcella's school,
see if you can find something.

11:58.651 --> 11:59.885
Ten bucks?

11:59.952 --> 12:03.189
It's for the bus ticket.
Keep the change.

12:03.556 --> 12:04.657
Damn it.

12:12.631 --> 12:13.899
Hi.

12:13.966 --> 12:15.701
-Where's Augusto?
-Back there.

12:25.544 --> 12:26.645
Augusto?

12:27.747 --> 12:28.848
Hi. What's up?

12:29.949 --> 12:31.050
We found the car.

12:33.719 --> 12:35.788
What about my daughter?
And Roberta?

12:36.589 --> 12:37.590
No.

12:38.491 --> 12:39.825
Damn!

12:39.892 --> 12:40.993
Damn, Raul!

12:42.561 --> 12:45.898
Did Roberta have any enemies?

12:46.532 --> 12:47.666
I don't know.

12:47.967 --> 12:49.502
What if she's hurt?

12:49.568 --> 12:50.870
Calm down. Calm down.

12:52.204 --> 12:55.541
If you hired Raul,
it's because you know he's good.

12:56.675 --> 12:57.777
Calm down.

13:01.113 --> 13:04.650
I need to go to her house.
Do you have the keys?

13:05.651 --> 13:06.786
No.

13:08.154 --> 13:09.688
What about our deal?

13:18.731 --> 13:19.799
That's it.

13:21.066 --> 13:22.168
Thank you very much.

13:23.803 --> 13:24.904
I trust you.

13:26.505 --> 13:27.640
Right.

13:33.479 --> 13:35.581
SEPARATED COUPLE
AUGUSTO - ROBERTA - MARCELLA

13:35.881 --> 13:38.984
Never tell a client
that we will find a person.

13:39.919 --> 13:41.554
He needed support.

13:41.620 --> 13:43.622
What if I don't find
his daughter?

13:44.056 --> 13:46.058
What if something
happened to them already?

13:46.926 --> 13:48.060
What if it's too late?

13:49.461 --> 13:50.830
I'm sorry.

13:50.896 --> 13:52.498
I was just trying to help.

13:56.135 --> 13:57.736
That repair shop...

13:58.971 --> 14:00.840
It isn't a regular repair shop,
is it?

14:02.508 --> 14:04.176
Thugs can be fathers too.

14:06.812 --> 14:09.515
Can you imagine how it feels
when a loved one disappears?

14:09.582 --> 14:10.983
Gone without a trace?

14:32.538 --> 14:35.074
What do you look for
in a missing person's house?

14:36.609 --> 14:37.810
Clues.

14:42.915 --> 14:45.985
Are you looking
for something specific?

14:47.119 --> 14:48.454
Alright. Let me tell you.

14:49.121 --> 14:51.457
There was a dog in the truck.

14:52.157 --> 14:53.492
Right.

14:53.559 --> 14:57.663
But there's no dog food
or toys in this house.

15:00.699 --> 15:02.001
What does that mean?

15:19.785 --> 15:20.853
Raul!

15:24.857 --> 15:26.592
Did you see any ashtrays
around the house?

15:27.693 --> 15:29.028
The house smells
like cigarettes.

15:30.496 --> 15:31.830
But nobody smokes here.

15:32.698 --> 15:34.433
Looks like a man did it.

15:36.535 --> 15:39.004
My grandma used to throw her
cigarette butt into the toilet.

15:39.071 --> 15:42.007
Did your grandmother
also pee on the toilet lid?

15:44.877 --> 15:45.978
Only men do that.

15:47.179 --> 15:49.815
And this was a man
who knew Roberta intimately.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.067
Roberta...

16:08.934 --> 16:11.603
She must have some boyfriend
or an affair.

16:14.139 --> 16:16.542
I'm right. Right?

16:18.210 --> 16:19.545
Admit it. I'm right.

16:20.212 --> 16:21.747
Maybe.

16:25.117 --> 16:27.853
Do you think he is the one
who took them?

16:30.656 --> 16:32.024
Do you know what I think?

16:33.192 --> 16:36.095
You should ask less questions
and focus on your article.

16:40.766 --> 16:42.034
Hello, Raul.

16:42.101 --> 16:45.804
Roberta has a friend
who picks up Marcella sometimes

16:46.472 --> 16:47.673
Her name is Daniele.

16:47.740 --> 16:49.942
I'm sending her address.
She lives in Perus

16:57.616 --> 16:59.118
Are you and Roberta close?

17:00.786 --> 17:02.521
We're single moms.
We understand each other.

17:03.956 --> 17:05.891
When was the last time
you saw them both?

17:06.992 --> 17:08.193
Wednesday.

17:08.260 --> 17:10.829
Roberta asked me to pick up
Marcella from school.

17:10.896 --> 17:15.667
We think Roberta
was with someone. A man.

17:15.734 --> 17:16.802
A boyfriend, maybe.

17:17.569 --> 17:19.905
I never met him.
I don't even know his name.

17:20.973 --> 17:23.475
Judging by her behavior,
he's not a nice guy.

17:23.976 --> 17:26.111
She always does this
when she meets bad men.

17:27.212 --> 17:29.648
May I know who hired you?

17:29.715 --> 17:31.750
Augusto, her ex-husband.

17:37.756 --> 17:39.058
Do you know Augusto?

17:41.126 --> 17:42.661
No, I don't.

17:43.729 --> 17:46.999
Sorry, but I'm very busy, so...

17:47.533 --> 17:49.668
-Sure.
-Thank you.

17:50.903 --> 17:52.037
Thanks.

17:54.807 --> 17:57.042
Is he always moody like that?

17:57.109 --> 17:59.478
Moody? I think he likes you.

18:02.481 --> 18:03.582
Found it!

18:04.016 --> 18:05.751
-What?
-Raul, come here!

18:06.552 --> 18:09.855
Here, Raul.
That's him. I'm sure.

18:10.522 --> 18:11.623
Zoom in on the tattoo.

18:23.802 --> 18:24.870
Hello.

18:25.838 --> 18:28.574
What's up, Husky Duck?
How's work?

18:28.640 --> 18:29.808
We're in crisis.

18:30.542 --> 18:33.479
People are throwing less trash
on the street.

18:35.581 --> 18:37.516
I'm checking that situation
about your girl.

18:37.583 --> 18:38.684
Hey.

18:40.119 --> 18:41.620
That is our secret.

18:42.754 --> 18:43.989
Here.

18:44.056 --> 18:45.924
Thanks, boss!

18:46.625 --> 18:47.826
This is a good one.

18:48.560 --> 18:49.928
It's the last time
I give you these.

18:49.995 --> 18:51.363
Stop smoking that trash.

18:52.564 --> 18:53.732
Come here.

18:59.371 --> 19:00.439
What does that tattoo mean?

19:00.906 --> 19:02.040
The "1533"?

19:02.875 --> 19:06.612
15th letter of the alphabet: P.
Then repeat the third.

19:08.180 --> 19:09.381
"PCC".

19:11.850 --> 19:13.385
I have known him for years, pal.

19:13.952 --> 19:16.088
He was arrested
at the same time as me.

19:16.155 --> 19:17.556
-Waldir.
-He is called

19:18.490 --> 19:21.426
Fábio Tavares, the famous Fabão.

19:26.698 --> 19:27.799
What are we doing here?

19:28.667 --> 19:32.571
You're here
to observe and absorb.

20:15.948 --> 20:17.583
SOFIA FAGNANI
MOTIVE

20:20.919 --> 20:23.055
KIDNAPPING

20:58.957 --> 21:00.826
Missing your old office, Raul?

21:00.892 --> 21:02.060
COLLEGE DEGREE - RAUL FAGNANI

21:04.563 --> 21:06.164
The office is better now.

21:06.231 --> 21:07.933
CERTIFICATE - MARCO DAMASCENO

21:09.701 --> 21:12.137
And those bruises? Work or fun?

21:12.971 --> 21:14.773
My work is fun, Dama.

21:15.974 --> 21:18.844
Tell me what you want.
I know you didn't miss me.

21:18.910 --> 21:20.912
I came to bring you a gift.

21:23.582 --> 21:24.683
Scotch.

21:39.931 --> 21:43.769
Fábio Tavares.
I need the full criminal record.

21:45.771 --> 21:47.406
It's not that simple.

21:48.073 --> 21:50.008
Dama, it's just a record.

21:50.876 --> 21:52.811
He kidnapped a 9-year-old girl.

21:56.615 --> 21:58.450
Any other information about him?

22:05.123 --> 22:06.191
Wow.

22:06.992 --> 22:09.628
His criminal record
is a piece of work.

22:10.262 --> 22:13.198
A member of the PCC gang.
Many criminal offenses in youth.

22:13.832 --> 22:15.534
The Maria da Penha Law,

22:15.600 --> 22:17.436
for beating his girlfriend.

22:18.637 --> 22:20.005
What about his address?

22:21.840 --> 22:24.176
He lives in the Copan building.
Apartment 322.

23:34.446 --> 23:36.648
-Got you!
-Let me go!

23:50.128 --> 23:51.396
Raul!

23:52.931 --> 23:54.099
Help me!

24:02.941 --> 24:04.176
-Hey!
-Stop!

24:25.063 --> 24:26.798
What the hell happened?

24:26.865 --> 24:29.468
I have nothing to do
with what happened in Pari.

24:29.901 --> 24:31.102
What are you talking about?

24:32.037 --> 24:33.572
Aren't you cops?

24:33.638 --> 24:34.806
Let's go.

24:40.479 --> 24:41.680
Don't you dare.

24:41.746 --> 24:42.948
Don't you dare.

24:43.014 --> 24:45.116
How long have you been
dating Roberta?

24:46.685 --> 24:47.819
Are you here because of her?

24:48.687 --> 24:50.422
I really like her.

24:51.089 --> 24:53.792
Where were you yesterday
and this morning?

24:54.493 --> 24:56.428
I was...

24:56.962 --> 24:58.897
-Working on a construction.
-Give me your phone.

24:59.664 --> 25:01.933
Give me the phone, come on.

25:03.869 --> 25:06.037
Show me your boss's number.

25:06.938 --> 25:09.808
And pray that he answers
my call.

25:14.646 --> 25:17.048
Tai, call this number

25:17.115 --> 25:19.851
and check if Fabão was with him
at the moment of the kidnapping.

25:19.918 --> 25:21.119
What kidnapping?

25:21.920 --> 25:23.588
Who kidnapped them? Who?

25:25.190 --> 25:27.859
We've had our fights,
like every other couple.

25:28.460 --> 25:30.095
But I swear
I don't know where she is.

25:30.161 --> 25:32.531
I haven't seen her
since the day before yesterday.

25:34.666 --> 25:36.101
I swear. I swear.

25:36.535 --> 25:38.904
If I don't find
this child alive,

25:40.438 --> 25:41.473
you're screwed.

25:42.073 --> 25:43.608
You're screwed.

25:44.209 --> 25:46.011
I would never hurt that girl!

25:47.012 --> 25:48.947
Raul, that's enough.

25:50.215 --> 25:52.951
That is not
what your criminal record says.

25:55.820 --> 25:57.088
I like Marcella.

25:57.889 --> 25:59.524
We get along.

25:59.991 --> 26:02.427
Was it Daniele who hired you?

26:03.161 --> 26:05.063
It was her ex, that bastard,

26:05.130 --> 26:06.197
Alberto?

26:06.831 --> 26:07.866
Augusto.

26:09.034 --> 26:10.468
That's the name of the bastard.

26:10.802 --> 26:12.571
You should investigate him,
not me.

26:17.275 --> 26:18.643
Hey, look.

26:19.077 --> 26:20.812
Your alibi has been confirmed.

26:21.880 --> 26:23.181
But wise up.

26:23.882 --> 26:25.050
Now get lost.

26:25.584 --> 26:27.519
I told you I had nothing
to do with it!

26:32.624 --> 26:33.992
I should follow him?

26:34.726 --> 26:35.827
I don't believe that guy.

26:36.595 --> 26:37.696
Goddamn it.

26:47.606 --> 26:48.707
Raul?

27:14.532 --> 27:15.667
New people at the agency?

27:17.102 --> 27:18.770
No. She's a journalist.

27:24.109 --> 27:25.410
It's been three years.

27:26.911 --> 27:28.446
It seems longer.

27:29.881 --> 27:30.949
You look great.

27:32.017 --> 27:33.551
You haven't changed anything.

27:33.918 --> 27:36.121
Look, I'm in the middle
of an investigation...

27:36.187 --> 27:37.188
See?

27:38.023 --> 27:39.157
You haven't changed.

27:40.492 --> 27:41.960
Don't worry.

27:44.596 --> 27:46.898
I just need you
to solve this for me.

28:01.613 --> 28:04.516
Calm down! Stop! Leave it!

28:05.650 --> 28:06.851
Put it back!

28:06.918 --> 28:08.953
Cut it off!

28:09.020 --> 28:10.722
Let it go!

28:26.471 --> 28:28.039
My friendship with Raul
goes way back.

28:29.741 --> 28:30.842
How did it start?

28:33.912 --> 28:36.081
I'm not part of your article,
got it, sweetie?

28:36.147 --> 28:38.116
I just want
to understand him better.

28:38.483 --> 28:40.118
He's not very helpful, right?

28:40.452 --> 28:43.354
He doesn't care
if people like him or not.

28:43.755 --> 28:46.391
I think you understood
him enough.

28:47.058 --> 28:48.359
Just a second.

28:59.604 --> 29:01.673
-You wanted to see me?
-Yes.

29:07.812 --> 29:09.147
Did he kidnap my daughter?

29:09.514 --> 29:12.684
I'm not sure yet.
He and Roberta...

29:12.751 --> 29:15.653
What? Is Roberta...?

29:17.689 --> 29:19.390
My daughter never told me
about this.

29:21.059 --> 29:22.427
What a bastard!

29:23.061 --> 29:25.597
If he kidnapped my daughter,
I'll kill him.

29:30.135 --> 29:31.569
Who's this woman?

29:31.636 --> 29:33.938
A friend of Roberta's.
Don't you know her?

29:36.040 --> 29:38.476
It seems not even
Roberta knows her.

29:38.543 --> 29:40.578
-Raul?
-Just a second.

29:44.516 --> 29:45.617
Look what I found.

29:46.084 --> 29:48.052
She bought something
in this drugstore

29:48.119 --> 29:49.754
one day before disappearing.

29:49.821 --> 29:52.357
The drugstore is right
in front of this hospital.

29:52.891 --> 29:55.026
-So what?
-I spoke with the hospital.

29:55.093 --> 29:56.594
Domestic violence.

29:57.662 --> 29:59.597
Did Fabão hit Roberta?

30:01.065 --> 30:02.801
You're doing great today, Tai.

30:03.735 --> 30:07.672
That man over there
can't hear any of this.

30:07.739 --> 30:09.607
-Got it?
-Got it.

30:09.674 --> 30:10.775
What now, Raul?

30:11.543 --> 30:12.977
Now, let's rest.

30:13.545 --> 30:16.681
How?
What if Fabão finds Roberta?

30:17.148 --> 30:18.883
That's enough for today.

30:20.752 --> 30:23.054
-Alright.
-Goodbye.

30:23.555 --> 30:25.023
-Bye.
-Bye. Thank you.

30:33.131 --> 30:34.666
Are you serious?

30:34.732 --> 30:38.970
I can't review the case with her
asking a thousand questions.

30:43.074 --> 30:44.542
FLIGHT SAO PAULO - ASUNCIÓN

30:48.580 --> 30:50.515
SÃO PAULO'S EXPANDED CENTER

32:15.099 --> 32:16.467
What?

32:17.135 --> 32:18.436
Isn't your story over?

32:19.070 --> 32:20.471
Is the investigation over?

32:37.021 --> 32:38.523
Raul. It's Waldir.

32:39.590 --> 32:40.892
Man...

32:40.959 --> 32:42.126
Fabão is very chill.

32:42.460 --> 32:44.796
He went to a cousin's house,
spent all night there.

32:45.763 --> 32:47.899
He woke up early
and came to work.

32:48.566 --> 32:50.034
He's working now.

32:50.101 --> 32:52.704
-I was hoping that was it.
-Yeah.

32:54.138 --> 32:56.107
What do I do now?
I wanna go home, take a shower.

32:56.474 --> 32:59.510
You can go, Waldir.
You spent the night working.

33:41.919 --> 33:43.654
Can you tell me
what you are looking for?

33:45.690 --> 33:47.725
We were looking
in the wrong place.

33:49.994 --> 33:51.396
What happened?

34:27.198 --> 34:28.466
Goddamn it.

34:29.934 --> 34:31.436
And he hired you.

34:33.704 --> 34:35.840
He was not worried
about their disappearance.

34:36.507 --> 34:38.409
He was worried
because they ran away from him.

34:40.511 --> 34:41.946
Where is that bastard?

34:44.115 --> 34:45.550
-Raul?
-Where's Augusto?

34:45.616 --> 34:47.051
He left about an hour ago.

34:51.789 --> 34:55.526
They are not missing.
They are hiding.

34:56.861 --> 34:58.396
Daniele!

35:00.698 --> 35:03.067
And now he knows
about her because of us!

35:28.025 --> 35:29.160
Help!

35:30.161 --> 35:32.163
-Help!
-Calm down!

35:32.897 --> 35:35.133
Daniele! Are you okay?

35:35.500 --> 35:37.535
Come with me.

35:39.003 --> 35:40.037
Come.

35:41.973 --> 35:44.442
Sit here. Come on.

35:49.213 --> 35:51.549
Who did this to you? Calm down.

35:51.616 --> 35:53.151
Who did this? Augusto?

35:55.019 --> 35:57.722
He rushed in
and started to hit me.

35:57.788 --> 36:00.024
He said I knew where they were.

36:00.091 --> 36:02.693
-Calm down.
-And did you?

36:02.760 --> 36:04.195
They just wanted to leave.

36:04.562 --> 36:08.199
Roberta found out that Fabão
beat his ex-girlfriend

36:08.266 --> 36:10.601
and was afraid to go
through the same thing.

36:10.668 --> 36:12.036
She has a cousin in Portugal.

36:12.737 --> 36:14.772
She packed her bags.
But Augusto found out.

36:14.839 --> 36:17.975
He found them, hit her
and tried to kidnap them both.

36:19.143 --> 36:21.646
-I just helped them hide.
-It's alright.

36:21.712 --> 36:25.082
-You did the right thing.
-He's crazy! Do something!

36:29.554 --> 36:31.088
Tai, could you track him down?

36:31.155 --> 36:33.524
No. Augusto turned off the GPS.

36:33.591 --> 36:34.859
But I'll track his cell phone.

36:34.926 --> 36:37.461
I need you to talk to him.
I'll connect you both.

36:41.532 --> 36:43.134
Hello? Hi, Raul!

36:43.901 --> 36:45.636
Glad you called, I'm desperate!

36:46.103 --> 36:48.839
Augusto, I'm raising
some hypotheses.

36:49.907 --> 36:53.611
Could you come to the agency
to see some things?

36:55.179 --> 36:58.749
Hello? Raul?
I can't understand you.

36:58.816 --> 37:00.051
I'm losing the signal.

37:00.785 --> 37:02.820
Raul, the signal is very weak..

37:02.887 --> 37:04.522
Hello? Hello?

37:13.264 --> 37:16.000
It's alright, sweetie,
it's going to be okay.

37:16.667 --> 37:18.669
It's just a friend of mine
who helped me find you.

37:19.237 --> 37:21.172
Everything will be fine.

37:21.539 --> 37:23.975
It's not alright! Let us go!
Augusto, stop!

37:24.809 --> 37:26.077
Tai, did you track him?

37:26.143 --> 37:28.679
Life isn't like the movies.
The phone has GPS.

37:28.746 --> 37:30.681
The location appears
as soon as you connect it

37:31.249 --> 37:32.883
They are driving
to the Marginal.

37:34.252 --> 37:35.586
You can go now. I'm monitoring.

37:36.654 --> 37:37.989
Fine. Let's go!

37:42.193 --> 37:43.828
Stop the car, Augusto!
Let us go!

37:44.595 --> 37:45.830
What do you mean, Roberta?

37:46.530 --> 37:48.666
I spent a lot of money
to find you.

37:48.733 --> 37:50.701
Stop it, Augusto.
I won't come back to you.

37:51.469 --> 37:53.437
You cannot separate
a father from a daughter.

37:54.105 --> 37:56.540
-After everything I've done...
-She's not your daughter!

37:56.607 --> 37:58.042
She's not your daughter!

37:58.609 --> 37:59.910
She's not your daughter!

37:59.977 --> 38:01.712
Mom, I'm feeling sick.

38:09.020 --> 38:11.822
Are you going to back up here?
Are you crazy?

38:11.889 --> 38:13.691
It's a one-way street!

38:14.091 --> 38:15.493
Hold on.

38:29.774 --> 38:32.009
-I'm going to puke.
-Keep your head up.

38:32.076 --> 38:34.011
-Calm down, baby.
-Don't touch her!

38:34.078 --> 38:36.113
-Shut up!
-Bastard!

38:36.480 --> 38:38.115
Baby, everything will be fine.

38:38.182 --> 38:39.617
Stay calm, baby.

38:39.684 --> 38:42.119
-Calm down.
-Everything will be fine.

38:42.186 --> 38:43.421
Don't worry.

38:44.689 --> 38:45.790
STOP AT THE RED SIGN

38:50.161 --> 38:53.698
Let us go! She's feeling sick!

38:54.065 --> 38:55.900
She's feeling sick,
can't you see?

39:03.607 --> 39:05.743
-Let us go.
-I'll pull over.

39:06.210 --> 39:10.614
If you try anything,
if you try to fool me,

39:10.681 --> 39:12.550
I will kill you, Roberta.

39:15.686 --> 39:16.954
There! There!

39:21.692 --> 39:22.793
Augusto!

39:26.597 --> 39:27.698
Damn!

39:29.967 --> 39:32.503
-Mom!
-Let her go, Augusto!

39:32.570 --> 39:34.905
Let me go! Mother! Mother!

39:36.173 --> 39:37.475
Augusto!

39:38.175 --> 39:40.111
-Let me go!
-Let her go, Augusto!

39:40.177 --> 39:41.712
-Augusto!
-Calm down, baby.

39:41.779 --> 39:44.515
-Stop! Stop!
-Mom! Mom!

39:45.750 --> 39:47.485
Go away. Go.

39:47.885 --> 39:49.520
-Calm down.
-Stop right there.

39:49.587 --> 39:52.356
-It's over, Augusto.
-What do you want, Raul?

39:52.757 --> 39:55.459
You've done your job,
you found her, now get lost!

39:55.526 --> 39:56.861
Think about your daughter.

39:56.927 --> 39:58.062
Look.

39:59.730 --> 40:02.867
Drop your gun and let's talk.

40:02.933 --> 40:04.502
You haven't done anything
against her yet.

40:04.568 --> 40:06.504
I would never do anything
against Marcella!

40:06.570 --> 40:08.038
Then nothing will happen to you.

40:08.506 --> 40:10.541
Put the gun down. Listen to me.

40:10.608 --> 40:12.476
Put it down and let's talk...

40:14.512 --> 40:15.679
The hero has arrived!

40:16.180 --> 40:17.782
What do you want, idiot?

40:17.848 --> 40:19.683
You stole my wife,
what else do you want?

40:19.750 --> 40:21.485
To be my daughter's father?

40:21.552 --> 40:23.954
Fabão, stop.
Let me solve this thing.

40:24.021 --> 40:25.923
He will not lay a finger
on my wife.

40:27.558 --> 40:29.126
Come on, you bastard! Kill me!

40:29.660 --> 40:31.529
Kill me and you will
never see them again.

40:31.595 --> 40:33.097
You will be in jail forever.

40:33.664 --> 40:35.599
It's all her fault!

40:36.767 --> 40:38.068
After all I've done for you!

40:39.036 --> 40:41.439
You run away with the thing
I love the most?

40:41.505 --> 40:44.041
Stop! Our marriage is over.
Accept it.

40:44.108 --> 40:45.843
Shut up!
I don't want to hear you!

40:47.077 --> 40:48.913
You can't take
my daughter away from me.

40:49.513 --> 40:51.482
-Augusto, stop.
-Stay away, Raul!

40:51.549 --> 40:53.083
-Augusto, calm down!
-Stay away!

40:53.150 --> 40:54.819
-Please...
-Or you'll pay for this.

40:55.453 --> 40:58.489
-Father, please, stop!
-Calm down, baby!

41:08.899 --> 41:10.000
Let him go!

41:11.502 --> 41:12.570
Let him go!

41:41.432 --> 41:42.633
Daughter...

41:48.939 --> 41:51.876
I'm sorry, baby.
Forgive your father.

42:14.198 --> 42:16.133
You shouldn't
be credited for this arrest.

42:17.501 --> 42:19.803
You're too old to play the hero.

42:20.170 --> 42:22.139
Your friend will be in jail
for a while.

42:22.940 --> 42:25.442
Unlicensed weapon.
Kidnapping attempt.

42:26.877 --> 42:29.013
Go get some rest, Raul.
I'll take it from here.

42:31.215 --> 42:33.117
Marco Damasceno. Police chief.

42:33.484 --> 42:35.419
Maria Júlia. Journalist.

42:37.888 --> 42:39.990
-What about him?
-Leave him alone.

42:40.057 --> 42:41.592
Enough arrests for today.

42:43.661 --> 42:46.130
He's becoming a better person.

42:47.031 --> 42:49.567
Don't try to undermine my work.

42:53.003 --> 42:54.071
Get some rest, Raul.

42:55.806 --> 42:57.007
Are you really
going to Portugal?

42:58.809 --> 42:59.910
I need a fresh start.

43:01.478 --> 43:02.980
For me and her.

43:04.548 --> 43:06.116
I will miss you.

43:09.820 --> 43:11.488
Thank you for everything.

43:12.590 --> 43:13.724
Thank you.

43:32.176 --> 43:34.445
DIVORCE PAPERS

43:47.324 --> 43:49.126
Is there more
where that came from?

44:15.486 --> 44:17.154
There's something
I did not understand.

44:19.189 --> 44:20.524
The dog.

44:22.192 --> 44:25.529
If it didn't belong to Marcella,
Roberta or Augusto...

44:27.231 --> 44:28.932
Why was it in the car?

44:29.800 --> 44:32.703
He climbed into the truck
to search for food.

44:33.570 --> 44:35.105
And ended up being
adopted by Tai.

44:36.807 --> 44:39.476
Sometimes, even the underdogs
have a good day.

44:43.147 --> 44:44.481
Take a look.

44:52.790 --> 44:55.125
-What is this?
-That's all I know about you.

44:57.194 --> 44:59.830
I spoke to the people
at your newspaper, the Gazette.

45:00.464 --> 45:03.634
They confirmed that there is
an employee named Maria Júlia.

45:04.702 --> 45:06.603
She is covering a congress,
in Asia.

45:09.106 --> 45:11.842
Do you know how many people
I've helped find?

45:14.344 --> 45:15.879
How many people depend on me?

45:17.648 --> 45:20.150
Did you really think
you'd sneak into my work,

45:20.217 --> 45:23.120
my team, my agency

45:24.354 --> 45:25.989
and I would not investigate you?

45:28.992 --> 45:30.160
Tell me.

45:32.529 --> 45:33.764
Who are you?
