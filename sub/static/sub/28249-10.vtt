00:03.891 --> 00:05.578
Previously on "The Village"...

00:05.617 --> 00:07.752
One of Max's friends
tried an open adoption,

00:07.789 --> 00:09.516
and it got pretty complicated.

00:09.588 --> 00:11.343
So I would never see the baby?

00:11.412 --> 00:12.674
Katie!

00:12.717 --> 00:14.563
You need to find his heartbeat!

00:14.600 --> 00:16.554
There it is.

00:16.591 --> 00:18.500
Got a job offer a few weeks ago...

00:18.537 --> 00:19.768
South Carolina.

00:19.811 --> 00:21.813
You should come back to
the Village until you go.

00:21.935 --> 00:23.923
You wanna help me deface your property?

00:23.960 --> 00:25.757
Well, I wanna ask for your number.

00:25.991 --> 00:28.064
Patricia's having surgery tomorrow.

00:28.101 --> 00:31.040
Her tumor's causing complications.

00:31.084 --> 00:32.259
Here.

00:32.302 --> 00:34.087
I'm just glad you're happy now, Ben.

00:34.130 --> 00:36.176
I'm not saying good-bye yet.

00:36.219 --> 00:37.269
I wish you would.

00:37.307 --> 00:38.414
She's running.

00:38.500 --> 00:39.648
I have to go.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.182
- How are you?
- You look nice.

00:43.235 --> 00:44.406
Thank you.

00:44.845 --> 00:47.631
Something's wrong.

01:48.282 --> 01:50.980
Pop, what's wrong?

01:51.171 --> 01:52.999
I wanna get married.

01:59.399 --> 02:01.450
Voicemail again.

02:02.618 --> 02:04.372
Call Patricia.

02:09.839 --> 02:11.679
Please be okay.

02:40.503 --> 02:43.065
Hello? Anybody home?

02:43.159 --> 02:45.640
Yeah, come on in.

02:48.598 --> 02:50.382
Oh.

02:50.518 --> 02:53.559
My favorite squatter back again.

02:53.690 --> 02:55.779
You on patrol?

02:55.885 --> 02:57.255
Just heading up to the roof.

02:57.346 --> 02:58.604
It's kinda cold out.

02:58.695 --> 02:59.826
Mm.

02:59.944 --> 03:01.741
Cold means numb.

03:01.893 --> 03:03.787
It sounds appealing right now.

03:03.948 --> 03:06.398
You could hug my dog. He's warm.

03:07.987 --> 03:10.315
Hey, sweetie boy. Mm-hmm.

03:10.604 --> 03:12.112
- So...
- Oh, my goodness.

03:12.171 --> 03:14.479
How much trouble is Ron in,

03:14.516 --> 03:16.254
if I know about your surgery?

03:19.542 --> 03:21.948
I'm glad he has someone to talk to.

03:22.496 --> 03:24.354
For what it's worth,

03:24.994 --> 03:27.565
I couldn't imagine life without my leg.

03:28.219 --> 03:32.121
And here I am, squatting.

03:33.425 --> 03:35.106
Nick, you ever get a bad feeling

03:35.143 --> 03:37.282
before you head into battle?

03:37.856 --> 03:38.987
Yeah.

03:39.205 --> 03:40.519
How did it work out?

03:43.566 --> 03:45.438
I always made it home.

03:47.790 --> 03:49.494
Did everyone else?

03:57.420 --> 03:59.673
You are gonna be fine.

04:01.080 --> 04:03.082
Too many people count on you.

04:08.135 --> 04:09.853
- Katie?
- It's Liam.

04:09.896 --> 04:11.996
I'm at Mercy Hospital with Katie.

04:12.421 --> 04:13.857
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

04:13.948 --> 04:16.180
Contractions, maybe.
She says she's in pain.

04:16.284 --> 04:18.721
Okay. Yeah, I'll be right there.

04:20.017 --> 04:21.642
Katie's in the hospital.

04:23.258 --> 04:24.563
I'm here.

04:24.600 --> 04:26.604
- Did you get my mom?
- I left another message.

04:26.729 --> 04:29.079
I'm sorry, are you a relation, sir?

04:30.127 --> 04:31.309
I'm the father.

04:31.353 --> 04:32.571
Okay, good.

04:32.743 --> 04:34.134
Basically, I drive around,

04:34.171 --> 04:36.371
looking for derelict
buildings to restore.

04:36.531 --> 04:37.899
Because...

04:38.055 --> 04:40.075
Everybody wants to tear things down.

04:40.112 --> 04:42.071
Half the time, they don't
even look past the front door.

04:42.336 --> 04:43.895
So you like a project.

04:44.242 --> 04:46.207
I see potential.

04:47.064 --> 04:48.641
What about you?

04:48.759 --> 04:51.680
Uhm, I'm a nurse at a nursing home.

04:52.930 --> 04:54.446
But until recently,

04:54.483 --> 04:57.208
I pretty much defined myself
as a good mother.

04:59.238 --> 05:00.718
And now?

05:02.232 --> 05:03.451
Bad mother.

05:03.488 --> 05:04.924
Mm... I don't buy it.

05:04.961 --> 05:07.260
I've got five older sisters,
three of them have kids.

05:07.297 --> 05:09.026
You have five sisters?

05:09.063 --> 05:11.741
I spent my entire childhood
with a lousy manicure.

05:13.269 --> 05:15.706
So you know ugly buildings and women.

05:15.875 --> 05:18.191
And a good thing when I see it.

05:20.844 --> 05:21.970
And if that was too forward,

05:22.007 --> 05:23.487
- it was absolutely the wine talking.
- No...

05:23.523 --> 05:25.766
No, it was actually really nice.

05:26.262 --> 05:27.728
Thank you.

05:28.627 --> 05:30.649
In that case, it was all me.

05:31.835 --> 05:33.140
<i>Is this your purse here?</i>

05:33.177 --> 05:35.179
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

05:39.922 --> 05:42.260
- Everything okay?
- Uh, no.

05:42.563 --> 05:44.164
I'm sorry, I have to go.

05:44.603 --> 05:46.110
Um...

05:53.544 --> 05:55.384
- I'm looking for my daughter.
- Ma'am, there's someone

05:55.420 --> 05:56.940
- in front of you.
- Her name is Katie Campbell.

05:56.977 --> 05:58.625
- Ma'am...
- Somebody needs to take me

05:58.662 --> 06:00.142
- to my daughter.
- I said there's someone...

06:00.178 --> 06:03.225
Sarah. Sarah, come with me. Come here.

06:05.548 --> 06:07.985
Apparently she was hit by
a bike messenger earlier.

06:08.029 --> 06:11.032
Liam brought her in.
They said the baby's fine.

06:11.172 --> 06:12.385
A couple of hours ago,

06:12.422 --> 06:14.490
she started having contractions.

06:14.775 --> 06:15.825
Braxton Hicks?

06:15.863 --> 06:17.268
Maybe, but either way,

06:17.305 --> 06:19.388
the fluids seem to
have slowed them down.

06:19.432 --> 06:22.307
The bottom line is she's okay.

06:23.399 --> 06:25.297
Sarah, Nick is here.

06:25.428 --> 06:26.946
He's in the waiting room.

06:27.479 --> 06:29.046
Has he seen her?

06:37.754 --> 06:39.253
You just missed her.

06:39.370 --> 06:41.591
She fell asleep a few minutes ago.

07:24.932 --> 07:27.151
Okay, thank you.

07:35.506 --> 07:37.029
What are you in for?

07:38.989 --> 07:41.399
Family thing. You?

07:41.436 --> 07:43.025
First date.

07:43.386 --> 07:45.606
Kinky.

07:45.717 --> 07:48.279
Not exactly.
She's back there with somebody else.

07:48.342 --> 07:49.977
Everything okay?

07:50.122 --> 07:51.253
Not entirely sure.

07:51.290 --> 07:53.147
She popped out and said I could leave,

07:53.701 --> 07:56.354
but... she looked really upset.

07:56.779 --> 07:58.052
Didn't seem right.

07:58.095 --> 08:01.004
Yeah, stick around.
She'll appreciate it.

08:20.145 --> 08:21.972
You called the authorities.

08:28.428 --> 08:31.041
Oh, Patricia.

08:31.139 --> 08:33.592
What are you thinking,
leaving me a text message?

08:33.647 --> 08:35.890
There was no point in
both of us losing sleep.

08:35.958 --> 08:38.201
You're the one having surgery later.

08:38.294 --> 08:39.919
I guess I showed up early.

08:40.162 --> 08:42.052
Your defenses are down.

08:42.096 --> 08:44.794
You've got a low white
blood cell count.

08:44.838 --> 08:45.969
They need me.

08:46.013 --> 08:48.429
For longer than today?

08:48.994 --> 08:50.872
It's a holiday.

08:51.501 --> 08:54.195
It would be weeks before
you could reschedule.

08:54.430 --> 08:57.894
The doctor said waiting
even a few days...

08:57.970 --> 09:02.073
What the doctor has said
is burned into my brain.

09:02.573 --> 09:04.575
I will attend my surgery,

09:04.674 --> 09:09.032
but I will not let this
cancer take me from my girls.

09:14.988 --> 09:17.360
They got any coffee in here?

09:20.177 --> 09:21.758
Mm.

09:56.118 --> 09:57.685
The first one your eyes went to.

09:57.722 --> 09:58.955
That's always the one.

09:58.999 --> 10:00.087
Bright as her eyes.

10:00.130 --> 10:01.936
I'm impressed you can even lift it.

10:02.032 --> 10:03.688
Thank you for the early house
call, Mose.

10:03.725 --> 10:05.161
I still owe you for the thing.

10:05.739 --> 10:07.616
- What thing?
- Don't worry about it.

10:07.873 --> 10:09.459
I'll take it.

10:09.584 --> 10:10.641
Pops,

10:10.678 --> 10:12.012
are you sure about this?

10:12.080 --> 10:13.328
Gwendolina is great,

10:13.365 --> 10:14.563
but you just started seeing her.

10:14.600 --> 10:17.084
I mean,
she's never even spent the night.

10:17.172 --> 10:19.303
Because we're not engaged, I mean,

10:19.340 --> 10:21.227
what kind of woman you take her for?

10:21.456 --> 10:22.531
Right.

10:22.568 --> 10:24.633
- Get your father on the phone.
- Why would I do that?

10:24.677 --> 10:26.978
He bamboozled the power of attorney.

10:27.412 --> 10:30.806
He gave me a $300 limit
like some snot-nosed kid.

10:31.379 --> 10:34.162
Maybe it's better if
he finds out after.

10:34.463 --> 10:35.743
He didn't even want
you out of the home.

10:35.779 --> 10:38.000
I'm not sure this is
gonna get his blessing.

10:38.037 --> 10:40.350
I don't need his blessing.
I need my money.

10:41.041 --> 10:42.701
I'm not taking no for an answer.

11:00.974 --> 11:02.522
How's your head?

11:03.498 --> 11:05.258
Not good.

11:05.561 --> 11:07.344
I almost didn't recognize the room.

11:07.381 --> 11:10.427
Friend of mine had a baby.
She needed the things.

11:11.545 --> 11:13.334
Gave her everything?

11:13.533 --> 11:16.068
I don't need old toys
to remember my son.

11:19.205 --> 11:21.670
You should eat something before you go.

11:21.944 --> 11:23.303
Ohw.

11:23.715 --> 11:25.500
A girl in my building's
at the hospital.

11:25.537 --> 11:27.391
I'll grab something there.

11:27.547 --> 11:29.631
You give his clothes away too?

11:30.656 --> 11:32.440
You looking for memories, Ben?

11:32.834 --> 11:34.053
'Cause I got a few,

11:34.217 --> 11:36.094
like getting called at 3:00 a.m.
every night,

11:36.131 --> 11:37.371
finding you on the floor of that dive.

11:37.467 --> 11:40.725
I haven't done something
like that in a long time.

11:40.865 --> 11:42.319
I'm running to the store.

11:42.498 --> 11:45.409
I need you to be gone
by the time I get back.

12:01.123 --> 12:02.735
Hey.

12:03.166 --> 12:04.561
You stayed.

12:04.772 --> 12:06.126
Of course, yeah.

12:06.169 --> 12:08.128
What's going on?

12:08.232 --> 12:11.168
Uh, I'm sorry, you were asleep.

12:11.764 --> 12:13.827
Nick, this is Ethan.

12:15.889 --> 12:18.085
- First date.
- Family thing?

12:18.233 --> 12:19.922
- You've met.
- Mm-hmm.

12:19.959 --> 12:21.358
Spent the night together.

12:22.841 --> 12:24.966
- How's she doing?
- Still sleeping,

12:25.066 --> 12:27.348
peacefully, thank God.

12:27.815 --> 12:29.556
Peaceful's good.

12:30.552 --> 12:33.615
- Can we talk for a minute?
- Yeah, yeah.

12:33.740 --> 12:35.882
- Be right back.
- Yeah.

12:45.113 --> 12:47.006
Now I'ma let you say it,

12:47.084 --> 12:48.514
only because you're moments away,

12:48.551 --> 12:50.293
from a terrifying surgery.

12:50.365 --> 12:52.341
Plot thickens.

12:52.433 --> 12:54.875
- Feel better?
- Much.

12:57.351 --> 12:59.303
Seemed like a good guy.

13:01.452 --> 13:03.427
Sarah and I are just friends.

13:04.670 --> 13:06.882
If you didn't feel the slightest tinge

13:06.919 --> 13:08.875
of jealousy or regret,

13:09.059 --> 13:11.250
then I think it's for the best.

13:13.236 --> 13:15.673
You know,
you should be pulling for him.

13:15.912 --> 13:17.000
I got issues.

13:17.037 --> 13:18.475
Maybe.

13:19.765 --> 13:21.490
But you're family.

13:31.849 --> 13:34.631
I saw him at the V.A., and we decided

13:34.897 --> 13:36.795
maybe it was time he get to know her.

13:37.478 --> 13:38.740
How'd that go?

13:39.061 --> 13:41.264
- It's still going.
- Mm.

13:41.653 --> 13:43.397
Ethan, I didn't mean for you to stay.

13:43.647 --> 13:45.101
I totally meant to leave.

13:45.138 --> 13:47.014
The bench was so
comfortable, I fell asleep.

13:48.881 --> 13:50.404
You should get some rest

13:50.447 --> 13:52.921
on something more
comfortable than a bench.

13:54.529 --> 13:55.667
Okay, you good?

13:55.704 --> 13:59.248
I am, thank you. It's very kind of you.

14:01.870 --> 14:03.420
Okay.

14:04.318 --> 14:08.509
By the way, this doesn't
feel like "bad mom" to me.

14:26.437 --> 14:27.613
Hello, you.

14:33.857 --> 14:35.231
My stomach hurts.

14:35.275 --> 14:36.754
Should I call the doctor?

14:36.904 --> 14:38.278
- I think I might be sick.
- No, hold on.

14:38.315 --> 14:39.492
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

14:39.529 --> 14:41.759
Something's not right! I...

14:41.982 --> 14:45.589
Help... help!

14:45.897 --> 14:47.768
Ohh...

14:48.990 --> 14:51.421
Hey. Got a second?

14:51.625 --> 14:53.020
Yeah.

14:53.336 --> 14:55.568
- How you doing?
- Long night.

14:57.313 --> 14:59.386
Ms. Campbell,
Katie needs you right now.

15:07.059 --> 15:08.449
- Katie!
- Mom?

15:08.491 --> 15:10.667
I'm here now, baby.
Why is she bleeding?

15:10.835 --> 15:13.270
Ms. Campbell we think Katie's
placenta may be detaching.

15:13.307 --> 15:14.435
Nobody noticed before?

15:14.472 --> 15:15.538
There could have been
a small separation

15:15.574 --> 15:17.443
from the accident that got
worse during the night.

15:17.480 --> 15:19.463
- What does that mean?
- It means Katie's already

15:19.500 --> 15:20.980
- at 7 centimeters.
- So what will happen?

15:21.017 --> 15:23.594
Ms. Campbell,
this baby's coming out right now.

15:27.396 --> 15:31.139
I changed your diapers,
you ungrateful imp.

15:31.896 --> 15:34.950
Because it's my money,
and I have needs.

15:34.987 --> 15:36.249
Pops, give me that.

15:37.896 --> 15:39.321
Pop, that's not gonna end well.

15:40.084 --> 15:41.259
What are you doing?

15:41.309 --> 15:43.311
You want your money,
I'll sue him for it.

15:43.419 --> 15:46.401
In the meantime,
you already have a ring.

15:46.576 --> 15:48.216
That's Rosemary's.

15:48.302 --> 15:50.172
It's got the right kind of history.

15:50.232 --> 15:52.406
I'm not proposing to another woman

15:52.443 --> 15:53.958
with your grandmother's ring.

15:55.127 --> 15:58.043
That's probably her scolding you.

15:58.585 --> 16:01.427
It's Patricia. Katie's having her baby.

16:09.818 --> 16:11.689
Still no update.

16:13.050 --> 16:15.400
When's Patricia due upstairs?

16:15.716 --> 16:17.246
Doesn't matter.

16:17.326 --> 16:20.198
She won't go until she
knows they're safe.

16:20.591 --> 16:22.185
Yeah, I get it.

16:23.090 --> 16:24.583
Do you?

16:24.818 --> 16:26.054
Excuse me?

16:26.091 --> 16:29.661
Sarah told Patricia about your new job.

16:30.358 --> 16:33.100
You know, Nick,
I never pegged you for someone

16:33.144 --> 16:35.059
who would cut and run.

16:35.287 --> 16:36.927
I'm not running...

16:37.739 --> 16:39.736
giving them their life back.

16:39.825 --> 16:43.568
Yeah, and how'd that
work out the first time?

16:44.670 --> 16:46.287
Hmm?

16:50.019 --> 16:51.977
Oh, hey, man.

16:54.600 --> 16:55.992
How's everybody?

17:08.805 --> 17:10.880
You want an apology,

17:11.566 --> 17:15.266
my humility, reverence?

17:16.798 --> 17:18.191
You're getting an ultimatum.

17:18.228 --> 17:19.701
You have to breathe

17:19.738 --> 17:21.326
all the way through the contraction.

17:22.720 --> 17:24.374
Yep.

17:24.411 --> 17:25.979
Okay, breath in.

17:26.021 --> 17:28.958
Okay, okay. That's it.

17:29.224 --> 17:30.680
When it's over, it's over, okay?

17:30.717 --> 17:32.712
That's your time to rest, okay?

17:32.825 --> 17:34.433
- Okay.
- It really hurts.

17:34.470 --> 17:35.804
I know.

17:39.949 --> 17:42.210
- I don't have an overnight bag.
- It's okay.

17:42.387 --> 17:44.389
Enzo and Gabe are gonna
bring some things, okay?

17:44.509 --> 17:46.381
There's supposed to be candles.

17:48.471 --> 17:50.531
What's that?

17:50.787 --> 17:52.440
It's a warming station.

17:53.139 --> 17:55.037
He's little, so they're gonna have to

17:55.074 --> 17:56.271
give him some extra help.

17:56.308 --> 17:58.229
Oh.

17:58.334 --> 18:00.100
Honey, you're gonna have
another contraction.

18:00.166 --> 18:02.342
Breathe through it.

18:02.537 --> 18:03.961
Okay, okay, breathe with me. Okay?

18:03.998 --> 18:06.647
I want you to breathe.

18:06.770 --> 18:10.817
One more.

18:11.368 --> 18:13.435
Do what you want with me,

18:14.011 --> 18:16.982
but deliver that girl
and her baby safely.

18:18.951 --> 18:20.667
Or so help me...

18:22.397 --> 18:24.007
I will come after you.

18:25.560 --> 18:27.432
All right. How we doing?

18:27.520 --> 18:28.944
She's at 8 centimeters,

18:28.981 --> 18:30.794
contractions every two minutes.

18:30.866 --> 18:34.700
Fetal heart rate looks great.
Let's take a look, huh?

18:35.315 --> 18:36.714
Okay.

18:37.790 --> 18:39.923
Ice chips. I saw nothing.

18:39.960 --> 18:41.536
- Nick of time.
- What the hell are you doing?

18:41.572 --> 18:43.246
- You asked for ice chips.
- Leave!

18:43.283 --> 18:44.536
Okay, all right. I'll take those.

18:44.579 --> 18:46.787
Why don't you go find a candle?

18:46.837 --> 18:48.496
Ow, I'm okay.

18:48.533 --> 18:50.650
- I just hurt my knee.
- You're knee hurts?

18:50.687 --> 18:52.108
You should go.

18:52.860 --> 18:54.463
Okay, Katie, it's time.

18:58.269 --> 19:00.358
Here we go baby, you ready? Here we go.

19:00.465 --> 19:03.642
One... two... three...

19:03.814 --> 19:07.036
Push, baby, push.

19:25.403 --> 19:27.100
Okay, rest, rest. Okay?

19:27.143 --> 19:28.754
Okay.

19:28.978 --> 19:30.440
I don't wanna do this.

19:30.477 --> 19:32.587
I know, I know, sweetheart.

19:32.671 --> 19:35.478
This baby is working
hard, but he needs you.

19:36.001 --> 19:38.003
Doctor.

19:38.633 --> 19:40.886
What's happening?

19:40.923 --> 19:42.605
Katie, the baby's
heart rate is dropping.

19:42.642 --> 19:44.486
He needs you to push with
everything you've got,

19:44.523 --> 19:45.608
right now.

19:45.645 --> 19:48.034
You're doing so great, honey.
You've got this.

19:48.100 --> 19:49.517
I know you can do it.

19:49.595 --> 19:51.777
Here we go, baby. You ready?

19:51.820 --> 19:53.213
Okay.

19:53.257 --> 19:55.215
I want you to push on three.

19:55.259 --> 19:58.610
Let's go. One... two... three... push!

19:58.653 --> 20:00.176
Go!

20:00.220 --> 20:02.167
Push!

20:04.476 --> 20:06.595
One... two... three... push.

20:06.767 --> 20:08.228
Push... That's it, that's it.

20:08.272 --> 20:10.274
Push!

20:10.317 --> 20:11.758
Push!

20:14.843 --> 20:16.802
It's all the way out.

20:17.149 --> 20:19.326
Baby, you did it.

20:19.539 --> 20:20.975
You did it.

20:21.012 --> 20:22.623
There you go, you did it.

20:30.344 --> 20:32.302
Where are they taking him?

20:33.775 --> 20:36.040
They're trying to warm him up.

20:36.561 --> 20:39.665
What's going on? Why isn't he crying?

20:39.702 --> 20:40.782
Mom?

20:44.569 --> 20:45.700
They need to help him to breathe.

20:45.744 --> 20:46.701
What?

20:46.745 --> 20:48.877
Shh, baby, it's okay.

20:55.470 --> 20:57.220
You made it all the way out, baby.

20:57.257 --> 20:59.956
You fight! You breathe right now.

20:59.993 --> 21:02.108
You hear me? You breathe.

21:09.289 --> 21:11.552
It's okay.

21:37.611 --> 21:39.350
These are just initial scores.

21:39.435 --> 21:41.898
Eventually,
we'll be looking for milestones.

21:42.234 --> 21:45.417
I'm happy to discuss with the
potential adoptive parents.

21:46.437 --> 21:49.353
Thank you for everything.

21:49.658 --> 21:51.028
Tough girl.

21:51.094 --> 21:52.617
Learned by example.

21:55.353 --> 21:59.121
Have you called them?
The adoptive parents.

21:59.697 --> 22:01.564
It all happened so fast.

22:02.994 --> 22:06.066
I haven't talked to
Katie about it in weeks.

22:07.533 --> 22:09.610
I don't even know what she wants.

22:10.435 --> 22:12.774
This isn't gonna be easy.

22:22.900 --> 22:24.641
This was a public service.

22:24.678 --> 22:28.072
Another kid like you out there?
Look out, world.

22:28.194 --> 22:31.243
I'm never complaining
about law school again.

22:31.666 --> 22:33.918
Thank you for being here, all of you.

22:33.955 --> 22:36.202
Well, if you need anything
just give us a call, all right?

22:38.816 --> 22:42.884
Um, why don't we give these
ladies some time alone?

22:46.324 --> 22:50.938
I gotta take Patricia
upstairs, but I will be back.

22:54.873 --> 22:56.309
Liam.

23:00.391 --> 23:02.377
Did you mean what you said?

23:02.867 --> 23:05.265
After I got hit by the bike?

23:05.542 --> 23:08.539
I'm still here, aren't I?

23:16.534 --> 23:21.775
Elemental, resilient,
and still glowing.

23:23.520 --> 23:25.740
How you feeling, Supergirl?

23:25.947 --> 23:28.017
What's upstairs?

23:28.773 --> 23:30.824
I was hoping you missed that.

23:31.997 --> 23:33.877
Oncology...

23:34.086 --> 23:36.266
they're gonna take this cancer out.

23:39.479 --> 23:42.367
You wipe that worry away.

23:42.574 --> 23:45.494
This is nothing compared
to what you just did.

23:47.775 --> 23:49.275
I get to be asleep for mine.

23:49.318 --> 23:51.059
Oh.

23:54.410 --> 23:57.718
- I love you.
- I love you too.

23:58.937 --> 24:00.814
Okay, come on.

24:01.069 --> 24:02.422
Two of you will be out there

24:02.459 --> 24:04.504
vandalizing again before you know it.

24:04.541 --> 24:07.417
Mm-hmm. Not as dumb as I look, huh?

24:07.480 --> 24:09.687
Go. Bye, baby.

24:10.314 --> 24:11.663
Come on.

24:15.335 --> 24:17.773
I told them one at a time.

24:20.323 --> 24:21.691
How is he?

24:21.909 --> 24:23.867
Breathing like a champ.

24:25.767 --> 24:27.812
He's so little.

24:29.903 --> 24:31.683
You were too.

24:34.407 --> 24:35.808
It's my fault.

24:35.887 --> 24:37.988
I wasn't watching where I was going.

24:38.065 --> 24:42.113
Katie, you saved him.

24:43.880 --> 24:45.925
I'm so proud of you.

24:49.907 --> 24:52.511
Mom, how did you do this alone?

24:53.558 --> 24:55.384
I wasn't alone.

24:57.212 --> 24:58.649
I was with you.

25:03.987 --> 25:05.470
Do over?

25:20.494 --> 25:22.453
I missed you so much.

25:27.627 --> 25:30.855
Brand-new life.
Think of what that kid'll do.

25:30.937 --> 25:35.807
Grow up, fall in love, propose...

25:36.164 --> 25:37.775
- What did I tell you?
- I know.

25:37.924 --> 25:40.313
But Nonna and I were pretty tight.

25:40.734 --> 25:42.475
I think she'd want
this ring on any hand

25:42.518 --> 25:44.075
that's holding yours.

25:44.760 --> 25:47.582
So what do you say,
do we go big or do we go home?

25:59.927 --> 26:01.807
How many cups of coffee?

26:03.197 --> 26:04.714
Six.

26:05.612 --> 26:07.326
How's she doing?

26:07.423 --> 26:11.297
Exhausted... brave as hell...

26:12.596 --> 26:14.181
And willing to see you.

26:16.858 --> 26:18.776
Did you pull some strings?

26:19.845 --> 26:21.760
You stuck around.

26:22.815 --> 26:24.343
Room 310.

26:26.510 --> 26:28.034
Thank you.

27:03.355 --> 27:05.752
I didn't think I'd make
it past the waiting room.

27:06.648 --> 27:08.563
But you came anyway.

27:10.873 --> 27:13.909
And once again,
I'm at a loss for words.

27:15.033 --> 27:17.949
I'm starting to think talking's
not exactly my strong suit.

27:20.090 --> 27:22.092
Well, if ever kidnapped by a cartel,

27:22.129 --> 27:24.001
your strong suit will come in handy.

27:24.098 --> 27:26.240
Oh, yeah. I'd crush that.

27:29.509 --> 27:31.086
And Katie, you were right when you said

27:31.127 --> 27:33.168
I wouldn't be here if
I hadn't lost my leg.

27:33.368 --> 27:35.333
I shouldn't have said that.

27:35.675 --> 27:37.468
It must have been awful.

27:38.633 --> 27:41.487
Yeah, in the hospital
for a couple of hours.

27:42.029 --> 27:45.293
Hurt... I was scared.

27:45.573 --> 27:48.536
And afterwards you were a
lot lighter and had a kid.

27:48.807 --> 27:51.462
Maybe we get each other
better than we think.

27:53.345 --> 27:55.608
You're not my consolation prize.

27:57.758 --> 28:00.291
You are what gives my tragedy meaning.

28:02.826 --> 28:04.374
Meeting you...

28:05.760 --> 28:08.490
it means my teammates, my best friend,

28:08.534 --> 28:10.507
they didn't die for nothing.

28:15.410 --> 28:19.073
What was his name? Your best friend.

28:19.940 --> 28:21.416
Cooper.

28:34.869 --> 28:36.749
It's nice to have a dad.

28:53.089 --> 28:54.862
Do you want me to call Claire?

29:01.587 --> 29:03.089
I wanna see him.

29:07.065 --> 29:09.029
Patricia said handing over custody

29:09.073 --> 29:12.250
might be easier if you don't.

29:15.731 --> 29:17.206
I have to.

29:19.518 --> 29:21.034
Okay.

29:31.784 --> 29:33.558
Here looking for backup?

29:35.398 --> 29:37.874
Maybe.

29:39.300 --> 29:41.026
I'm a little rusty.

29:42.628 --> 29:46.588
Question is, what are you here for?

29:49.503 --> 29:50.941
I, um...

29:52.501 --> 29:54.164
I was hard on you this morning.

29:54.292 --> 29:57.214
No. No, it was stupid.

29:57.533 --> 29:59.558
Going there was weak and...

29:59.659 --> 30:01.312
It was human.

30:02.039 --> 30:04.839
So was thinking that maybe we might...

30:06.913 --> 30:10.409
come back around.

30:16.159 --> 30:18.505
You deserve to be happy, Ben.

30:18.794 --> 30:21.229
There's no getting Derek back, but...

30:22.284 --> 30:24.636
no one's stopping you
from going to Canada.

30:30.978 --> 30:32.577
Here.

30:33.362 --> 30:35.716
I wasn't entirely honest earlier.

30:35.831 --> 30:38.206
I did keep some of his clothes.

30:38.847 --> 30:41.762
Maybe we can split this in two.

30:48.862 --> 30:51.066
Ben?

30:53.133 --> 30:56.641
Your son would want you to
go after the woman you love.

30:58.024 --> 30:59.887
Don't just let her walk away.

31:23.932 --> 31:25.107
Whew.

31:25.356 --> 31:27.820
That body of yours is
putting a beat down

31:27.863 --> 31:29.585
on that paper thing.

31:32.849 --> 31:36.635
Most beautiful cancer patient ever.

31:36.742 --> 31:38.407
You think I'll make the brochure?

31:38.444 --> 31:42.796
Oh, oh, yeah. Front cover for sure.

31:44.976 --> 31:46.664
How long do I have?

31:48.067 --> 31:49.679
A few minutes.

31:50.626 --> 31:51.976
Baby, how you feeling?

31:52.495 --> 31:55.629
Grateful for your patience.

31:57.820 --> 31:59.678
Our baby had a baby.

32:02.515 --> 32:03.982
She sure did.

32:09.589 --> 32:12.001
I know you always wanted that.

32:13.488 --> 32:14.750
I got other gifts.

32:14.787 --> 32:16.748
Oh, Patricia...

32:18.131 --> 32:20.797
you give life every day.

32:22.414 --> 32:24.309
You gave it to me.

32:29.226 --> 32:32.408
Patricia?

32:33.973 --> 32:36.062
- It's time.
- Mm-hmm.

32:43.735 --> 32:46.129
Thank you, Ron.

33:03.550 --> 33:05.345
Macklemore.

33:05.918 --> 33:09.005
Well, what do you
know, the wop is back.

33:09.226 --> 33:11.793
Couldn't hack it on the outside, huh?

33:11.964 --> 33:16.320
Macklemore, you don't like me,

33:16.462 --> 33:18.264
and I don't like you.

33:18.845 --> 33:20.464
We've stolen each other's meds...

33:20.501 --> 33:22.576
Hidden bed pans...

33:22.613 --> 33:24.528
It's a feud for the ages.

33:25.111 --> 33:27.105
Bud I heard you played Lincoln Center,

33:27.142 --> 33:28.669
and today I need a favor.

33:28.759 --> 33:30.116
Why would I do that?

33:30.220 --> 33:32.823
Because I know how much
you miss your wife,

33:33.467 --> 33:35.962
and I got a second chance at love.

33:38.717 --> 33:41.212
I never played Lincoln Center.

33:44.252 --> 33:46.732
It was Carnegie Hall.

33:58.144 --> 33:59.824
Which one is he?

34:01.339 --> 34:03.109
In the corner.

34:08.382 --> 34:09.808
You ready?

34:10.706 --> 34:11.972
Yeah.

34:17.032 --> 34:18.382
Can I touch him?

34:18.484 --> 34:20.000
Yeah.

34:33.699 --> 34:36.049
It's nice to finally meet you.

34:49.040 --> 34:50.550
Mom...

34:51.954 --> 34:53.873
I can do this.

34:56.072 --> 34:58.965
Katie, there's something
I haven't told you yet.

35:01.003 --> 35:04.572
The doctors are worried about
how long he didn't breathe.

35:06.884 --> 35:08.799
He may have been oxygen-deprived

35:08.836 --> 35:11.074
after the abruption too.

35:12.908 --> 35:14.780
He might...

35:17.329 --> 35:19.886
Katie, this could be really hard.

35:25.405 --> 35:28.452
Hard and happy aren't
mutually exclusive.

35:35.546 --> 35:37.636
You have a beautiful son.

35:43.729 --> 35:45.651
What do I say to Claire?

35:47.823 --> 35:50.057
We'll cross that bridge.

35:51.112 --> 35:52.374
Go on.

36:03.981 --> 36:05.940
You don't listen to anything they say.

36:05.977 --> 36:07.421
You hear me?

36:08.318 --> 36:10.522
You are not broken.

36:11.582 --> 36:14.464
I am your mother and I've got you.

36:15.667 --> 36:18.045
I have got you.

The doctor said it would be okay

36:41.029 --> 36:42.327
to kangaroo him if you wanted.

36:42.364 --> 36:43.440
What does that mean?

36:43.483 --> 36:45.069
It means that we put him on your chest,

36:45.106 --> 36:46.765
give him some skin-to-skin contact.

36:46.827 --> 36:47.915
It'll help them bond.

36:47.952 --> 36:49.315
I can hold him?

36:49.430 --> 36:52.187
Yeah, of course. He's yours.

37:02.247 --> 37:05.468
Ethan, dropped off food
and didn't wanna say hello?

37:05.505 --> 37:06.921
Yeah, it's a fine line

37:06.958 --> 37:08.394

You are safely on the thoughtful side.

37:16.988 --> 37:18.344
I think a decent meal is kind of

37:18.388 --> 37:20.338
the least a new mom deserves, right?

37:20.975 --> 37:22.716
What does a new grandmother get?

37:22.753 --> 37:24.307
I threw in a bottle of Ensure.

37:25.960 --> 37:29.094
Laughter, that's good.
Must mean everything's okay.

You're just nervous.

Hey, she should be so lucky.

38:54.580 --> 38:56.119
Enzo?

38:57.878 --> 38:59.916
Gwendolina Ferrari...

39:01.439 --> 39:02.971
will you marry me?

39:07.497 --> 39:08.880
I will.

39:19.888 --> 39:21.629
You doing okay?

39:23.411 --> 39:24.873
Gordon.

39:25.384 --> 39:28.474
Patricia left me a
message about her surgery.

39:28.583 --> 39:32.739
Last ditch effort she
said, just in case.

39:38.793 --> 39:40.447
Would you like someone
to pray with you?

40:00.017 --> 40:01.299
Hey.

40:02.111 --> 40:03.684
Would you like to hold him?

40:03.988 --> 40:05.527
Uh...

40:06.247 --> 40:08.017
I don't really know how.

40:08.113 --> 40:09.593
You just put him on your skin

40:10.049 --> 40:11.255
so he knows you're his.

40:45.461 --> 40:48.855
Eight... Seven...

40:49.306 --> 40:52.261
six... five...

40:52.362 --> 40:55.111
We'll all be here when she wakes up.

40:55.358 --> 40:57.404
And she will wake up.

40:58.825 --> 41:01.885
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

41:07.088 --> 41:08.619
Do you wanna meet him?

41:08.908 --> 41:10.924
Why don't you go ahead.

41:11.072 --> 41:13.013
There'll be plenty of time later.

41:34.714 --> 41:36.585
Hey, kid.

41:41.651 --> 41:43.043
Does he have a name?

41:43.297 --> 41:44.680
Yeah.

41:45.390 --> 41:46.522
It's Cooper.

41:51.221 --> 41:52.997
Good name.

42:00.036 --> 42:01.888
Can I hold him?
