[Hook] Mr. Smee! Me cabinet
of hooks, if you please!

01:29.790 --> 01:33.792
Aye, aye, cap'n!
Set her down, boys!

01:33.794 --> 01:37.596

Ye blundering buffoons!

01:37.598 --> 01:38.664
[groans]

01:38.666 --> 01:40.766
I need my windsock hook

01:40.768 --> 01:43.335
to see which way
the wind is blowing!

01:43.337 --> 01:44.970
Here she is, cap'n!

01:46.840 --> 01:48.874
[coughing]

01:49.909 --> 01:53.345
Oh, me cherished hooks
are filthy!

01:53.347 --> 01:54.847
Sharky! Bones!

01:54.849 --> 01:59.351
I want every hook in
this cabinet cleaned now!

01:59.353 --> 02:00.819
[both] Aye, aye, cap'n!

02:00.821 --> 02:04.690
[chuckles] Oh! Captain's
got some lovely hooks!

02:04.692 --> 02:08.794
- You clean this one, Bones!
- And you clean this one!

02:08.796 --> 02:10.796
And you clean this one!

02:10.798 --> 02:14.766
[both] Here, you clean this one!
Thanks, mate!

02:14.768 --> 02:16.635
[octopus giggles]

02:16.637 --> 02:19.771
Uh, weren't you supposed
to hand me some hooks?

02:19.773 --> 02:21.940
Where's the hooks
I gave you?

02:23.810 --> 02:26.945
- [burbles]
- [both scream]

02:26.947 --> 02:31.717
Nice Octy-pus,
give us them hooks.

02:31.719 --> 02:34.753
Yeah, fork over
that spoon!

02:34.755 --> 02:37.689
[burbling]

02:37.691 --> 02:39.758
[grunts]

02:39.760 --> 02:42.728
- [chuckles]
- He's getting away with them!

02:42.730 --> 02:46.431
[chuckles] Who's getting away
with what now?

02:46.433 --> 02:48.867
[screams]
That slippery scoundrel's

02:48.869 --> 02:50.736
got the Captain's hooks!

02:50.738 --> 02:52.804
[both] He handed them
over to the beasty!

02:52.806 --> 02:55.741
Oh, dear...
If the Captain finds out,

02:55.743 --> 02:57.976
you two will walk
the plank for sure!

02:57.978 --> 03:00.779
[both gasp] Not the plank!

03:00.781 --> 03:03.115
Bones, we got to
get them hooks back!

03:05.752 --> 03:08.453
- [Hook] Smee!
- [startled grunt]

03:08.455 --> 03:10.822
Where are those scurvy swabs

03:10.824 --> 03:13.692
who are supposed to be
cleaning my hooks?

03:13.694 --> 03:16.929
Oh, the boys are working
very, very hard, cap'n.

03:16.931 --> 03:19.898
[nervous chuckle]
Harder than you know!

03:21.434 --> 03:23.769
Now where'd he go?

03:23.771 --> 03:25.904
[Jake] Ahoy, Sharky!
Ahoy, Bones!

03:25.906 --> 03:28.807
[both] Ahoy, popinjays!

03:28.809 --> 03:30.876
Hey, fellas!
We were hiking Never Land

03:30.878 --> 03:32.978
when we saw something
funny come this way.

03:32.980 --> 03:36.815
It looked like...
a flying octopus?

03:36.817 --> 03:39.918
I wagers that's the octopus
that we're looking for!

03:39.920 --> 03:43.722
He made off with eight
of Captain Hook's hooks!

03:43.724 --> 03:47.993
And if the cap'n finds out,
we're gonna walk the plank!

03:47.995 --> 03:51.863
<i>- ¶ Ba-da-dee-do </i>
<i>- ¶ If your captain</i>
<i>is a cranky crook ¶</i>

03:51.865 --> 03:55.734
<i>- ¶ Ba-da-dee-do </i>
<i>- ¶ Then, matey, don't you</i>
<i>ever lose his hooks ¶</i>

03:55.736 --> 03:58.904
<i>- ¶ Ba-da-dee-do </i>
<i>- ¶ But if you do then</i>
<i>matey, I'll be frank ¶</i>

03:58.906 --> 04:02.808
<i>- ¶ Ba-da-dee-do </i>
<i>- ¶ You're going swimming</i>
<i>off the end of the plank ¶</i>

04:02.810 --> 04:04.509
<i>- ¶ How could it be? </i>
<i>- ¶ How could it be? </i>

04:04.511 --> 04:09.848
<i>¶ We got the plank walking</i>
<i>walk-the-plank blues ¶</i>

04:09.850 --> 04:12.050
<i>¶ We got the plank walking </i>

04:12.052 --> 04:17.789
<i>¶ Walk-the-plank blues </i>

04:19.058 --> 04:23.762
- Crackers! That is bad news!
- Don't worry, mateys,

04:23.764 --> 04:26.031
we'd be glad to help you
get Hook's hooks back!

04:26.033 --> 04:28.767
[both] You'd do that for us?

04:28.769 --> 04:34.039
Sure! Old Captain Hook
may be a cranky crook,
but you two are A-OK!

04:34.041 --> 04:36.541
Will you come along
and help us get back

04:36.543 --> 04:38.977
Captain Hook's hooks
for Sharky and Bones?

04:40.780 --> 04:43.882
Great! Remember to keep a
lookout for gold doubloons.

04:43.884 --> 04:47.052
Whenever we solve a
pirate problem together,
they'll appear.

04:47.054 --> 04:50.822
Then we'll collect them and put
them in our Team Treasure Chest!

04:50.824 --> 04:52.924
Is everybody ready?

04:52.926 --> 04:57.896
- I got my map!
- And I've got my pixie dust.

04:57.898 --> 05:01.066
The fairies gave it to me
so that we can use it to fly.

05:01.068 --> 05:03.135
But only in emergencies!

05:03.137 --> 05:06.004
Yo-ho, let's go!

05:08.808 --> 05:11.810
<i>¶ Yo-ho, mateys away </i>

<i>Together as a team ¶</i>

05:21.855 --> 05:23.922
<i>¶ And me </i>

05:26.592 --> 05:28.960
Yo-ho, let's... Duck!

05:30.863 --> 05:32.197
[burbles]

05:34.133 --> 05:39.004
Hey there, Octopus! Um, would
you please return those hooks?

05:41.007 --> 05:43.875
[chuckles] He's playing with us!

05:43.877 --> 05:48.947
Aye! He wants us to chase him
to get the hooks back.

05:48.949 --> 05:52.984
I have an idea! To catch
a sky-high critter,

05:52.986 --> 05:56.988
maybe we all just need
to be a little bit taller.

05:56.990 --> 06:00.225
Like, say, as tall
as those palm trees.

06:01.227 --> 06:03.028
Look alive, me hearties!

06:03.030 --> 06:05.997
Here comes that high-flying
eight-legger now!

06:05.999 --> 06:08.166
[playful burbling]

06:09.068 --> 06:11.103
[grunts] Missed him!

06:11.105 --> 06:14.940
I'll take those hooks! [grunts]

06:14.942 --> 06:18.009
[grunts] Yes!

06:18.011 --> 06:20.078
I got the fly swatter hook!

06:20.080 --> 06:22.948
Yo-ho, way to go, Izz!

06:24.083 --> 06:26.084
Gotcha!

06:26.086 --> 06:29.921
[both chuckles]
We got one! We got one!

06:29.923 --> 06:32.891
Yo-ho, way to go, mateys!

06:32.893 --> 06:36.895
We got two hooks back, and
we got two gold doubloons.

06:36.897 --> 06:40.165
Let's grab them and go
get the rest of Hook's hooks!

06:43.035 --> 06:48.206
Oh, Smee! The fish are jumping!
Fetch me my fishing rod hook.

06:48.208 --> 06:53.645
But, cap'n, that's one
of the hooks the boys are
working so hard to return,

06:53.647 --> 06:56.648
uh, to its former shininess!
[chuckles nervously]

06:56.650 --> 06:58.917
Now, Smee. I want it now!

06:58.919 --> 07:01.219
Right away, cap'n.
Oh, dear.

07:03.189 --> 07:07.159
Sir, your [stammers]
fishing rod hook.

07:07.161 --> 07:10.929
The real one.

07:11.998 --> 07:16.234
Well, cap'n, it's, uh,
actually a funny story.

07:17.069 --> 07:18.203
[burbles]

07:23.176 --> 07:27.112
Ah, coconuts!
That's a steep cliff.

07:27.114 --> 07:29.247
Looks like he
got away for good!

07:29.249 --> 07:31.082
I'm on it, Cubby!

07:31.084 --> 07:34.019
Bones, can I see
the whirly hook?

07:34.987 --> 07:38.223
Yo-ho, up I go!

07:40.226 --> 07:42.160
- [burbles]
- [chuckles]

07:42.162 --> 07:44.729
I'll take that, Octopus.

07:44.731 --> 07:47.165
And the butterfly net hook, too!

07:52.138 --> 07:56.041
Here comes the octopus
with only four hooks left.

07:56.043 --> 07:58.276
Mateys, follow those hooks!

07:59.212 --> 08:02.113
I'll get one. [screams]

08:02.115 --> 08:04.182
[burbles]

08:04.184 --> 08:07.152
[all] Yahoo!

08:07.154 --> 08:12.290
Yay-hey! We got three more hooks
and three more gold doubloons!

08:12.292 --> 08:14.759
Let's grab them and go!

08:14.761 --> 08:19.764
Well, so we took
each hook, one at a time,

08:19.766 --> 08:23.034
and decided to go
in order of their history.

08:23.036 --> 08:24.269
[burbles]

08:27.773 --> 08:32.277
Look! Octopus footprints.
He went this way.

08:32.279 --> 08:37.215
Whoa! That's one
awesome sand castle.

08:38.050 --> 08:39.150
[giggles]

08:39.152 --> 08:41.253
I see a tentacle
peeking out.

08:41.255 --> 08:45.757
I think the octopus
and Hook's hooks are inside.

08:45.759 --> 08:50.028
Goody! But, um,
how do we get him out?

08:50.030 --> 08:51.329
Maybe if we tickle him,

08:51.331 --> 08:55.100
he'll laugh so hard
he'll let go of the hooks!

08:55.102 --> 08:57.769
Perfect pirate plan, Cubby.

08:57.771 --> 09:00.372
- Gitchy-gitchy-goo!
- [octopus laughs]

09:01.307 --> 09:04.175
It's working!
Go, Cubby.

09:08.047 --> 09:09.981
[Cubby]
Grab those hooks, mateys!

09:13.786 --> 09:16.221
[all] The last three hooks!

09:16.223 --> 09:18.223
[all cheer]

09:18.225 --> 09:23.328
- That's eight hooks in all.
- And three more gold doubloons.

09:23.330 --> 09:25.797
Yo-ho, way to go!

09:25.799 --> 09:28.300
And thanks to you,
too, Mr. Octopus.

09:28.302 --> 09:30.335
[farewell burbles]

09:30.337 --> 09:32.804
[giggles]

09:32.806 --> 09:38.310
We got to return these hooks
to the <i>Jolly Roger</i> pronto!

09:38.312 --> 09:41.179
Izzy, this looks
like an emergency.

09:41.181 --> 09:46.084
You're right, Jake.
Pixie dust away!

09:47.253 --> 09:49.254
The lads wanted
to make sure

09:49.256 --> 09:52.824
that your very favoritest
hooks were treated in a way

09:52.826 --> 09:54.826
befitting
their place of honor

09:54.828 --> 09:57.395
in your honorable
cabinet of hooks.

09:57.397 --> 10:02.834
Smee, does this funny story of
yours have a point? Or an end?

10:02.836 --> 10:07.105
[stammers] Well, cap'n,
the truth is the boys...

10:07.107 --> 10:10.175
Well, they...
are just finishing.

10:10.177 --> 10:12.410
[chuckles] Thanks for
everything, mateys.

10:12.412 --> 10:14.412
Glad we could help.

10:16.315 --> 10:19.184
There you
scurvy bilgerats be!

10:19.186 --> 10:21.886
Where, where else
might we be, cap'n?

10:21.888 --> 10:23.254
Here's your hooks, cap'n,

10:23.256 --> 10:26.291
clean as a
whole bunch of hooks!

10:26.293 --> 10:30.428
What? Why they're even
more filthy and disgusting

10:30.430 --> 10:32.497
than they were before.

10:35.134 --> 10:37.335
Thanks for helping us
return Hook's hooks, mateys!

10:37.337 --> 10:39.304
Now let's count
our gold doubloons

10:39.306 --> 10:41.439
and put them in our
Team Treasure Chest.

10:49.181 --> 10:51.216
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>Well done, crew ¶</i>

10:51.218 --> 10:53.218
<i>¶ Everyone knew</i>
<i>just what to do ¶</i>

10:53.220 --> 10:55.253
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>with help from you ¶</i>

10:55.255 --> 10:58.189
<i>¶ It's time to count</i>
<i>our gold doubloons ¶</i>

10:58.191 --> 11:00.325
Come on, count with us!

11:00.327 --> 11:03.294
[all] Yeah!

11:04.430 --> 11:06.364
[Izzy] One, two...

11:06.366 --> 11:09.234
[Jake] Three, four, five...

11:09.236 --> 11:11.436
[Cubby] Six, seven, eight!

11:11.438 --> 11:14.372
[Jake] Yo-ho! For solving
pirate problems today,

11:14.374 --> 11:17.242
we got eight gold doubloons!

11:17.244 --> 11:19.277
Yo-ho, way to go!

11:19.279 --> 11:23.214
You know, it sure felt good
helping Sharky and Bones.

11:23.216 --> 11:28.420
And even Captain Hook. He really
loves those hooks of his.

11:30.256 --> 11:32.957
Well, you see, cap'n,
a wily octy-pus

11:32.959 --> 11:34.959
snuck aboard
and took them!

11:34.961 --> 11:40.265
That story is worse than
the salty story Smee told me.

11:40.267 --> 11:45.437
Oh, that does it! Walk the
plank, you scurvy swabs.

11:45.439 --> 11:47.505
[both] Aye, aye, cap'n.

11:49.275 --> 11:51.476
- [both laughing]
- [Bones] Oh, that tickles!

11:51.478 --> 11:54.212
Ooh, that looks fun, cap'n!

11:56.982 --> 11:59.984
Last one in's a briny barnacle!

11:59.986 --> 12:02.387
[all laughing]

12:02.389 --> 12:04.355
[burbles]

12:05.424 --> 12:07.392
Oh, very well!

12:08.461 --> 12:10.495
[all laughing ]

12:10.497 --> 12:13.231
- Smee!
- [Smee] Excuse me!

12:16.469 --> 12:19.370
<i>[Jake]</i> Mr. Smee's Pet.

12:19.372 --> 12:24.375
[Smee] Gather around, lads, and
feast your eyes on me new pet!

12:25.378 --> 12:31.416
Whoa, that's the funniest
looking cat I ever did see.

12:31.418 --> 12:34.385
'Tisn't a cat,
Bones, is it?

12:34.387 --> 12:38.957
[chuckles] No, it's a chameleon,
and his name is Blinky!

12:42.394 --> 12:44.329
[gasps] Where'd he go?

12:44.331 --> 12:46.397
[chuckles]
Oh, he's still here.

12:46.399 --> 12:48.366
Blinky can change his color

12:48.368 --> 12:50.468
so that he blends into
whatever's around him.

12:50.470 --> 12:52.237
See?

12:55.508 --> 12:56.508
[shrills]

12:56.510 --> 12:58.476
That little fella's amazing!

12:58.478 --> 13:00.645
And he's tricky, too!

13:00.647 --> 13:05.450
Mr. Smee! Why are you standing
around here lollygagging?

13:05.452 --> 13:07.385
I'm starving!

13:07.387 --> 13:08.686
[stomach rumbles]

13:10.689 --> 13:14.592
Oh, methinks someone's
got a rumbly in his tummy.

13:14.594 --> 13:16.361
Quickly, Smee!

13:16.363 --> 13:19.697
Fetch me one of your delicious
codfish casseroles.

13:19.699 --> 13:21.432
Aye, cap'n.

13:21.434 --> 13:25.537
[stammers] Uh, but who will
watch Blinky while I'm cooking?

13:25.539 --> 13:27.372
Blinky?

13:27.374 --> 13:30.375
[grunts] Oh. Blinky.

13:30.377 --> 13:33.411
[Smee] Ooh, I think
he likes you, cap'n!

13:33.413 --> 13:35.647
[grunts] Don't worry, Smee.

13:35.649 --> 13:37.749
The boys and I
will take good care

13:37.751 --> 13:41.586
of your precious little pet.
Isn't that right, lads?

13:41.588 --> 13:44.589
- Uh, right-o!
- Uh, aye, aye!

13:44.591 --> 13:49.661
Now, Smee, go wash your hands
and cook up me casserole.

13:49.663 --> 13:51.663
Don't you worry,
me little matey...

13:51.665 --> 13:53.498
- [yells]
- Blinky's gone!

13:53.500 --> 13:56.768
You lost that silly lizard
already? Oh, blast!

13:56.770 --> 14:00.572
If Mr. Smee finds out that
his precious pet is gone,

14:00.574 --> 14:04.475
he'll stop cooking me meal
and I'll never get to eat.

14:04.477 --> 14:08.513
Move it, men.
Find that Blinky!

14:08.515 --> 14:09.814
[both] Aye, aye, cap'n!

14:15.487 --> 14:16.621
[shrills]

14:18.657 --> 14:21.559
This fishing trip
is gonna be loads of fun!

14:21.561 --> 14:23.528
Yo-ho! I totally know.

14:23.530 --> 14:27.498
Say, mateys, would you
like to go fishing with us?

14:28.767 --> 14:32.537
Great! Remember to keep a
lookout for gold doubloons.

14:32.539 --> 14:35.807
Whenever we solve
a pirate problem together,
they'll appear.

14:35.809 --> 14:39.644
Then we'll collect them and put
them in our Team Treasure Chest!

14:39.646 --> 14:41.846
Yo-ho, let's go!

14:45.618 --> 14:48.653
<i>¶ Yo-ho, mateys away </i>

14:48.655 --> 14:51.456
<i>¶ There'll be treasure</i>
<i>and adventure today ¶</i>

14:51.458 --> 14:55.760
<i>¶ Heave ho, here we go</i>
<i>Together as a team ¶</i>

14:55.762 --> 14:58.696
<i>¶ Jake and</i>
<i>the Never Land Pirates ¶</i>

14:58.698 --> 15:00.665
<i>¶ And me </i>

15:03.769 --> 15:06.471
Cubby, what's the best
spot for fishing?

15:06.473 --> 15:08.773
- Let me check my map.
- [Jake] Hold up, Cubby.

15:08.775 --> 15:11.843
First, get your
fishing poles, everybody!

15:11.845 --> 15:13.778
- Awesome!
- Sweet!

15:13.780 --> 15:15.546
[Blinky shrills]

15:16.849 --> 15:19.651
We've searched
the whole ship, cap'n.

15:19.653 --> 15:21.819
He must have
gone ashore.

15:21.821 --> 15:25.823
Well, Smee's precious pet
couldn't have gone too far.

15:25.825 --> 15:29.494
What's this? Blast me buttons!

15:29.496 --> 15:32.697
It's Blinky
and the puny pirates!

15:32.699 --> 15:35.800
I should have known
those pests took Blinky.

15:35.802 --> 15:38.636
Men, we must rescue him
from those scurvy swabs

15:38.638 --> 15:42.573
before Smee finds out
that his precious pet is gone.

15:42.575 --> 15:43.775
[both] Aye, aye, cap'n!

15:43.777 --> 15:45.777
OK, Cubby,
lead the way

15:45.779 --> 15:48.680
to the best fishing hole
in Never Land.

15:48.682 --> 15:52.750
Aye, aye, Jake! Oh!
I almost forgot my map.

15:53.652 --> 15:55.620
Say, where is it?

15:55.622 --> 15:58.823
I know I put my map
right here on this log.

15:58.825 --> 16:01.626
- [Izzy] Are you sure?
- Double sure!

16:01.628 --> 16:04.796
Well, it's not like your map
just got up and walked away.

16:04.798 --> 16:05.964
Wanna bet?

16:06.799 --> 16:07.865
[Jake] That's weird!

16:07.867 --> 16:10.601
Is someone playing
some sort of joke?

16:10.603 --> 16:11.903
Cracked crackers!

16:11.905 --> 16:14.872
I don't think this joke
is very funny.

16:14.874 --> 16:17.809
Yo-ho, let's go
after Cubby's map!

16:23.816 --> 16:25.883
Huh. You were right, cap'n,

16:25.885 --> 16:28.686
the little matey
did go into the jungle.

16:28.688 --> 16:31.889
A-ha! Captain Hook
is always right.

16:31.891 --> 16:33.858
- [grunts]
- [startled screech]

16:35.761 --> 16:38.629
Barnacles!
We can't lose him now.

16:38.631 --> 16:41.899
[panting] Come here,
you little lizard.

16:42.735 --> 16:45.837
[grunts] Blast!

16:48.607 --> 16:51.709
My map! What's it
doing up there?

16:51.711 --> 16:54.412
I don't know,
but we're getting it back.

16:57.716 --> 16:59.917
Yo... Whoa!

16:59.919 --> 17:03.654
Oh, no, the hill's too steep.

17:03.656 --> 17:04.889
And slippery, too.

17:04.891 --> 17:06.724
I've got an idea.

17:06.726 --> 17:10.661
I can use my sword
to help me climb. Watch!

17:10.663 --> 17:12.930
[grunting]

17:15.868 --> 17:19.737
Yay-hey! I got up the hill
and got Cubby's map,

17:19.739 --> 17:24.942
and we got two gold doubloons.
Let's grab them and go fishing!

17:27.713 --> 17:29.881
Thanks, Jake!
Now let me take you

17:29.883 --> 17:34.619
to the best fishing hole
on Never Land: Pegleg Pond.

17:34.621 --> 17:35.820
Follow me.

17:37.823 --> 17:39.891
So what happened
to Mr. Blinky?

17:39.893 --> 17:41.793
Bubbling bilgewater!

17:41.795 --> 17:43.995
Those swiping swabbies
must have him,

17:43.997 --> 17:46.931
and they're taking him
on their fishing trip.

17:46.933 --> 17:49.767
I didn't know Blinky
liked to fish.

17:49.769 --> 17:50.968
Step lively, men!

17:50.970 --> 17:52.703
Once we get Smee's pet,

17:52.705 --> 17:54.639
I can get back
to the <i>Jolly Roger</i>

17:54.641 --> 17:57.041
and have my codfish
casserole dinner.

18:01.713 --> 18:03.815
<i>¶ Oh, I like fishing</i>
<i>Yes, sirree ¶</i>

18:03.817 --> 18:06.984
<i>¶ Fishing all day today</i>
<i>is fine by me ¶</i>

18:06.986 --> 18:08.920
<i>¶ Even if I don't</i>
<i>catch nothing ¶</i>

18:08.922 --> 18:10.955
<i>¶ It's fine by me </i>

18:13.826 --> 18:15.693
Snack time!

18:15.695 --> 18:19.697
I brought nuts, apple slices
and Skully's favorite.

18:19.699 --> 18:21.933
- Who's hungry?
- I am...

18:21.935 --> 18:23.868
Pipe down!

18:23.870 --> 18:25.736
[stomach rumbles]

18:25.738 --> 18:28.039
- Did you hear something?
- [Izzy] Yeah!

18:28.041 --> 18:30.908
- It sounded like a loud...
- [Blinky crunching]

18:30.910 --> 18:32.043
- [burps]
- Cubby!

18:32.045 --> 18:34.045
Aren't you supposed
to say, "Excuse me"?

18:34.047 --> 18:35.847
But it wasn't me!

18:35.849 --> 18:38.850
Hmm. There's something
fishy going on.

18:38.852 --> 18:42.053
Maybe the sneaky snack swiper
is around here somewhere.

18:42.055 --> 18:44.689
Like behind those bushes.

18:44.691 --> 18:47.892
I'll just use my sword
to push them aside, and...

18:47.894 --> 18:49.961
Hey, where's my sword?

18:49.963 --> 18:51.762
Sword ahoy!

18:53.999 --> 18:56.934
Oh, no, not again!

18:56.936 --> 19:01.072
It must be riding on that
tricky pet Blinky. Come on.

19:04.810 --> 19:08.913
I've got you now,
you pesky little pet!

19:08.915 --> 19:10.982
[gasps] Oh, confound it!

19:10.984 --> 19:12.083
Captain Hook?

19:12.085 --> 19:13.885
We should've known
it was you

19:13.887 --> 19:15.987
who's been ruining
our fishing trip.

19:15.989 --> 19:19.023
Me? I've done
nothing wrong,

19:19.025 --> 19:23.060
but you have.
You took Blinky!

19:23.062 --> 19:24.929
[all] Who's Blinky?

19:24.931 --> 19:27.932
Blinky is Mr. Smee's
precious pet.

19:27.934 --> 19:32.103
He's a chameleon what
disappears. And he's lost, too.

19:32.105 --> 19:34.805
Aw, poor little guy.

19:34.807 --> 19:36.807
We can help you
look for him.

19:36.809 --> 19:41.879
Well, I guess you could help me
crew, but not its captain!

19:41.881 --> 19:44.949
If that's what you want,
it's OK with me!

19:44.951 --> 19:47.919
So how are we going to find
a pet that can't be seen?

19:47.921 --> 19:51.889
Well, I bet it was Blinky
who ate all of our snacks.

19:51.891 --> 19:53.758
That gives me an idea.

19:53.760 --> 19:55.893
Let's put another
little snack right here.

19:55.895 --> 19:57.128
And when
the snack disappears,

19:57.130 --> 19:59.931
we'll know exactly
where Blinky is.

20:04.136 --> 20:06.103
[Blinky burps]

20:06.105 --> 20:08.906
It's him!
It's Blinky!

20:08.908 --> 20:11.776
- Yay-hey! We found Blinky.
- [shrills]

20:11.778 --> 20:13.978
And we got three more
gold doubloons!

20:13.980 --> 20:15.880
Let's grab them and go...

20:15.882 --> 20:19.116
- I'll take Blinky!
- [squeaks]

20:19.118 --> 20:22.053
Oh, no! Where did he go?

20:22.055 --> 20:23.221
He's on the run.

20:25.924 --> 20:27.091
Right up that tree!

20:28.093 --> 20:30.094
I am Captain Hook
and I order you

20:30.096 --> 20:32.863
to get down here
this instant!

20:32.865 --> 20:34.832
[panicked shrill]

20:34.834 --> 20:37.168
Careful,
you're scaring him.

20:38.804 --> 20:42.139
- He's gonna fall!
- This is an emergency!

20:42.141 --> 20:47.945
I'll get you down safely,
Blinky. Pixie dust away!

20:47.947 --> 20:52.883
- [squeaks, shrills]
- Gotcha! All right!

20:52.885 --> 20:56.821
We caught Blinky and we got
three more gold doubloons.

20:56.823 --> 21:00.024
Let's grab them and go make sure
that Blinky gets home safely.

21:02.027 --> 21:03.261
Here you go,
Captain Hook,

21:03.263 --> 21:06.097
but you gotta promise
you'll be extra careful

21:06.099 --> 21:08.099
with Mr. Smee's pet
this time.

21:08.101 --> 21:10.034
Oh, I promise.

21:10.036 --> 21:13.070
And he's not going to
disappear on me this time!

21:13.072 --> 21:16.841
Oh, no, I'm going
to stick very closely

21:16.843 --> 21:18.075
to this precious little...

21:19.044 --> 21:20.978
...Blinky.

21:23.181 --> 21:26.217
Thanks for helping us
find Mr. Smee's pet, mateys.

21:26.219 --> 21:28.853
Now let's put all
our gold doubloons

21:28.855 --> 21:31.055
into our Team Treasure Chest.

21:38.196 --> 21:40.197
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>Well done, crew ¶</i>

21:40.199 --> 21:42.233
<i>¶ Everyone knew</i>
<i>just what to do ¶</i>

21:42.235 --> 21:44.235
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>with help from you ¶</i>

21:44.237 --> 21:47.238
<i>¶ It's time to count</i>
<i>our gold doubloons ¶</i>

21:47.240 --> 21:50.041
Come on, count with us!

21:51.043 --> 21:52.276
[all] Yeah!

21:54.012 --> 21:55.980
[Jake] One, two...

21:55.982 --> 21:58.883
[Cubby] Three, four, five...

21:58.885 --> 22:01.118
[Izzy] Six, seven, eight!

22:01.120 --> 22:04.155
[Jake] Yo-ho! For solving
pirate problems today,

22:04.157 --> 22:06.190
we got eight gold doubloons!

22:07.092 --> 22:09.226
Now let's go fishing!

22:14.132 --> 22:16.100
<i>¶ Oh, I like fishing</i>
<i>yes, sirree ¶</i>

22:16.102 --> 22:19.170
<i>¶ Fishing all day today</i>
<i>is fine by me ¶</i>

22:19.172 --> 22:21.238
<i>¶ Even if I don't</i>
<i>catch nothing ¶</i>

22:21.240 --> 22:23.240
<i>¶ It's fine by me </i>

22:26.078 --> 22:28.012
Hey!
I caught something!

22:28.014 --> 22:30.181
[grunts] A boot?

22:30.183 --> 22:32.183
[all laugh]

22:35.954 --> 22:40.257
Why, Blinky! Have you been
sleeping there all this time?

22:40.259 --> 22:43.294
Oh, It's so nice to...
see you.

22:43.296 --> 22:45.262
[giggles] Well.

22:47.132 --> 22:50.067
[inhales deeply] Mmm.

22:50.069 --> 22:54.071
This codfish casserole
smells delicious, Mr. Smee.

22:54.073 --> 22:57.174
I really think you've
outdone yourself this time.

22:57.176 --> 23:00.177
- [Blinky chomping]
- [gasps] Hey, I...

23:02.347 --> 23:06.150
Oh, Blinky.

23:07.086 --> 23:10.287
<i>¶ What's more sneaky</i>
<i>than the snook? ¶</i>

23:10.289 --> 23:14.158
<i>¶ It's a cabinet full</i>
<i>of all his hooks ¶</i>

23:14.160 --> 23:17.161
<i>¶ Every one in his supply </i>

23:17.163 --> 23:20.231
<i>¶ Is a clever fruited</i>
<i>Hook surprise ¶</i>

23:20.233 --> 23:22.967
<i>¶ Got a plunger hook</i>

23:22.969 --> 23:24.301
<i>¶ Got a pinwheel hook</i>
<i>if you think that's odd ¶</i>

23:24.303 --> 23:26.237
<i>¶ Got a butterfly net</i>
<i>Fly swatter, too ¶</i>

23:26.239 --> 23:29.039
<i>¶ He can catch a bug</i>
<i>and squish it, eww! ¶</i>

23:29.041 --> 23:31.075
<i>¶ Got a shovel hook</i>
<i>that digs things up ¶</i>

23:31.077 --> 23:33.010
<i>¶ Got a hammer and spoon</i>
<i>Don't mix those up ¶</i>

23:33.012 --> 23:35.212
<i>¶ Got a whirly hook</i>

23:35.214 --> 23:38.315
<i>¶ And an egg beater hook</i>
<i>I don't know why ¶</i>

23:38.317 --> 23:41.185

<i>Oh, what a frumpy</i>
<i>grumpy goose ¶</i>

23:41.187 --> 23:44.321
