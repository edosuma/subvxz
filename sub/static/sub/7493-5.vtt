WEBVTT

00:04.125 --> 00:06.041
Finding the person
to run my new smoothie bar

00:06.125 --> 00:08.375
is something I take very seriously.

00:12.083 --> 00:13.542
Rudy, this is amazing.

00:15.166 --> 00:16.542
It's not gonna happen, Ted.

00:16.625 --> 00:17.834
Get out.

00:21.250 --> 00:22.917
Rudy, what was wrong with that guy?

00:23.000 --> 00:24.583
Ah, he just wasn't right.

00:24.667 --> 00:27.333
You can't hire just anyone
who walks in off the street.

00:27.417 --> 00:28.709
Hi, I'm Connie--

00:28.792 --> 00:30.417
Hey, Connie. You're hired. Let's do lunch.

00:34.959 --> 00:36.959
I'm done with my costume for HeroCon.

00:37.041 --> 00:38.000
What do you think?

00:38.417 --> 00:39.875
I think it's a little too tight.

00:39.959 --> 00:41.542
- Why?
- Because I can see

00:41.625 --> 00:43.875
that you had two carrot sticks
and a meatball for lunch.

00:48.667 --> 00:50.792
Uh, excuse me, who are you?

00:52.125 --> 00:53.250
Jerry,

00:53.625 --> 00:54.750
it's me, Milton.

00:54.834 --> 00:57.709
I'm wearing this outfit
for the Best New Superhero contest

00:57.792 --> 01:00.125
- at HeroCon.
- Oh, yeah. I heard of that.

01:00.208 --> 01:01.291
That's where a bunch of nerds

01:01.417 --> 01:02.917
walk around
the convention center in tights

01:03.000 --> 01:04.709
wondering why they can't get dates.

01:06.208 --> 01:08.458
That is not true.

01:08.542 --> 01:10.709
We know exactly why we can't get dates.

01:11.667 --> 01:13.041
The winner of this year's contest

01:13.125 --> 01:14.667
will have his character featured
in a comic

01:14.750 --> 01:16.750
by the legendary Don Mills.

01:16.834 --> 01:18.667
What makes you think you're gonna win?

01:18.750 --> 01:21.125
'Cause I have the coolest exit ever.

01:24.625 --> 01:26.709
Laser Blade out!

01:33.125 --> 01:35.208
Laser Blade out cold.

Yo, Milton, what's wrong?

02:21.667 --> 02:24.208
I have to go to my Aunt Gerty's
birthday party on Saturday.

02:24.291 --> 02:25.709
Oh, Gerty.

02:25.792 --> 02:27.375
Yeah, she's the aunt
who gives you the big,

02:27.458 --> 02:29.291
wet, slobbering mouth kisses.

02:29.625 --> 02:30.917
She's the one.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.125
I'll go for you.

02:34.208 --> 02:36.542
No, the problem is HeroCon is on Saturday.

02:36.625 --> 02:38.417
It's on Friday, too. Just skip school.

02:38.500 --> 02:41.041
Would you keep your voice down?

02:41.125 --> 02:42.542
Do you want me to go to jail?

02:43.542 --> 02:45.208
Just two guys

02:45.291 --> 02:47.917
talking about not skipping anything.

02:48.750 --> 02:50.458
No, it's easy, Milton.

02:50.542 --> 02:51.625
Look, I have an app on my phone

02:51.709 --> 02:53.458
that lets me sound like a worried mother.

02:53.542 --> 02:55.875
Let me just record a message
and then we'll call the principal.

02:57.542 --> 02:59.208
This is Doris Krupnick.

03:00.291 --> 03:02.458
Milton has the mumps
and won't be in school tomorrow.

03:02.542 --> 03:04.083
We're very worried about him.

03:04.166 --> 03:06.834
Boo-hoo, boo-hoo, boo-hoo.

03:06.917 --> 03:08.458
This is never gonna work.

03:08.542 --> 03:10.625
Ah, pipe down, you big wuss.

03:15.083 --> 03:16.333

03:43.667 --> 03:45.000
I'm Jack, this is my lab station.

03:45.083 --> 03:46.291
- Uh, who are you?
- Taylor.

03:46.375 --> 03:47.917
I've been assigned to be your lab partner.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.875
I've just transferred here
from the Swathmore Academy.

03:50.583 --> 03:53.166
Oh. Swathmore.

03:54.083 --> 03:55.333
You're at Seaford now.

03:55.417 --> 03:56.542
We may not be as fancy,

03:56.625 --> 03:58.709
but we are every bit just as smarter.

04:00.709 --> 04:03.417
You know you just put your hand
inside a dead frog, right?

04:05.125 --> 04:06.417
Yes, I do.

04:08.041 --> 04:10.291
Frog's still dead, Miss Bonnermeyer.

04:12.208 --> 04:14.709
Let's just do this, okay?

04:14.792 --> 04:17.750
Uh, we start with 15 drops of bromium.

04:17.834 --> 04:19.000
Okay.

04:19.709 --> 04:22.041
And...

04:22.125 --> 04:23.208
one.

04:23.792 --> 04:25.125
And...

04:25.208 --> 04:26.041
two.

04:26.125 --> 04:27.542
Seriously?

04:27.959 --> 04:29.291
Three...

04:29.417 --> 04:30.917
Okay, that's it. Daddy's gonna drive.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
No... What was that?

04:33.083 --> 04:34.083
You didn't even measure it!

04:34.166 --> 04:35.458
We're in the ballpark, Swathmore.

04:35.542 --> 04:37.375
Now we just need one scoop of sulfate.

04:37.458 --> 04:39.166
Oh, oh. I got this.

04:39.250 --> 04:40.625
But you know what?

04:40.709 --> 04:42.000
Let's do it your way.

04:42.709 --> 04:44.667
Hey, now, you learn quick.

04:44.750 --> 04:46.166
- That what I'm talking--
-

04:51.750 --> 04:53.917
Nice driving, Daddy.

04:59.542 --> 05:01.709
Oh-ho, there he is.

05:01.792 --> 05:03.458
Skipping school for HeroCon.

05:03.542 --> 05:05.583
Seaford's newest bad boy.

05:05.667 --> 05:06.959
I've changed, Jerry.

05:07.041 --> 05:08.458
I really am a bad boy.

05:08.542 --> 05:10.834
Last night, I didn't sleep in my pajamas.

05:10.917 --> 05:13.083
Only my underpants.

05:14.333 --> 05:15.667
And my t-shirt.

05:15.750 --> 05:17.583
And my woolly socks.

05:17.667 --> 05:19.291
And my mother's leg warmers.

05:20.625 --> 05:23.417
Yo, dude, you sure you want to wear
your costume on the bus?

05:23.500 --> 05:25.417
You know, people might mess with you.

05:26.333 --> 05:27.542
I know I would.

05:28.166 --> 05:29.625
I have to wear my costume.

05:29.709 --> 05:32.291
I can't risk anybody recognizing me
outside of school.

05:32.625 --> 05:33.834
But don't worry,

05:33.875 --> 05:37.792
I'm packing my proton sword
from the planet Zoomax.

05:38.792 --> 05:41.542
Ooh, I also have
my Tweety Help-Me whistle.

05:43.709 --> 05:45.500
Yo, I still remember you
blowing that thing

05:45.583 --> 05:48.083
when the nurse was combing out
your cowlick on picture day.

06:00.959 --> 06:03.583
One day I will avenge my cowlick.

06:03.667 --> 06:05.083
But until then,

06:05.166 --> 06:06.834
Laser Blade away!

06:09.875 --> 06:11.041
That one's locked.

06:11.917 --> 06:13.917
Laser Blade away!

06:18.792 --> 06:21.250
I don't know where
The Swingin' Swordfish is.

06:21.291 --> 06:23.834
You think there'd be
a sign around here somewhere.

06:29.166 --> 06:31.834
No!

06:44.333 --> 06:45.959
Thank you!

06:46.041 --> 06:47.208
Thank you!

06:47.291 --> 06:48.583
You saved my life.

06:48.917 --> 06:51.792
This little costumed freak saved my life.

06:52.917 --> 06:54.083
Who are you?

06:54.166 --> 06:56.792
I, uh... I...

06:58.291 --> 06:59.959
I'm the Laser Blade.

07:01.250 --> 07:03.083
Laser Blade away!

07:04.291 --> 07:05.792
Oh, come on, people.

07:05.875 --> 07:08.125
Superhero trying to make an away here!

07:08.208 --> 07:09.375
Gah!

07:19.250 --> 07:20.917
Connie,

07:21.000 --> 07:23.834
uh, look, you are doing great.

07:23.917 --> 07:26.125
It's just that, uh, another customer

07:26.208 --> 07:28.250
found a scrunchie in their smoothie.

07:28.333 --> 07:30.625
You know what? I don't like your attitude.

07:30.709 --> 07:32.125
I quit.

07:32.208 --> 07:34.166
I'm gonna go get a smoothie.

07:34.250 --> 07:36.500
Wait. You work at a smoothie bar.

07:36.583 --> 07:37.917
I wouldn't drink these.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.709
You have no idea the things
I've lost in some of them.

07:41.500 --> 07:43.083
You know what? Fine.

07:43.166 --> 07:45.667
Go ahead and quit. Who needs you?

07:48.542 --> 07:50.125
Hey, Con. It's Rudy.

07:50.208 --> 07:52.041
Yeah, I heard your job
didn't quite work out,

07:52.125 --> 07:54.792
so I guess you're free Friday night.

07:55.291 --> 07:57.291
Fine! Who needs you?

07:58.375 --> 08:00.083
Blueberry up, raspberry up,

08:00.166 --> 08:02.250
and one mango surprise.

08:02.834 --> 08:04.000
We don't have any mango.

08:04.083 --> 08:06.291
That's what makes it a surprise.

08:06.375 --> 08:08.291
I'm sorry, who are you?

08:08.375 --> 08:11.500
Taylor. I'm your new smoothie girl.

08:11.583 --> 08:13.583
But I know how much
you were paying Connie,

08:13.667 --> 08:14.792
and I want double.

08:14.875 --> 08:16.375
Yeah, okay.

08:16.458 --> 08:18.458
Uh, 20 bucks an hour it is.

08:18.542 --> 08:20.834
Wait, how did you know
how much Connie was making?

08:20.875 --> 08:21.959
I didn't.

08:22.041 --> 08:24.375
But you just told me. Thanks, boss.

08:28.583 --> 08:30.458
Wow. That is amazing.

08:30.542 --> 08:32.583
Tell it to the tip jar, hon.

08:33.166 --> 08:34.166
Yep.

08:35.166 --> 08:36.542
Do you have change for a nickel?

08:38.041 --> 08:40.375
Yeah, no, no, no. Just keep the change.

08:40.458 --> 08:42.041
Ooh, ooh, Jack.

08:42.125 --> 08:43.417
Hey.

08:43.500 --> 08:47.000
I finally hired someone
who knows what she's doing.

08:47.083 --> 08:48.792
You are going to love her.

08:50.375 --> 08:51.417
Taylor.

08:51.500 --> 08:52.500
Jack.

08:53.125 --> 08:54.417
Rudy.

08:56.792 --> 08:58.375
That's a weird game.

09:03.166 --> 09:04.750
No, no.

09:04.834 --> 09:05.917
No, can't do it.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.291
Dude, dude, dude.

09:07.417 --> 09:09.208
What you did in the courtyard was amazing.

09:09.291 --> 09:11.500
The paper's offering a $500 reward

09:11.583 --> 09:13.667
if the Laser Blade comes forward
to reveal himself.

09:13.750 --> 09:15.542
I have no idea what you're talking about.

09:15.625 --> 09:17.125
I was home with the mumps.

09:17.208 --> 09:18.875
The mumps, I tell you!

09:20.917 --> 09:22.625
You're a superhero, okay?

09:22.709 --> 09:24.333
Which means you need a sidekick.

09:24.417 --> 09:25.709
That could be me.

09:25.792 --> 09:28.792
Whenever we catch a criminal, I go "whoo!"

09:29.750 --> 09:32.834
Think about it.
We'd be Laser Blade and Whoo-Man.

09:34.709 --> 09:35.959
What?

09:37.083 --> 09:38.750
If word gets out that I'm the Laser Blade,

09:38.834 --> 09:39.875
I'll get detention.

09:39.959 --> 09:41.750
Then I'll fall in with the wrong crowd,

09:41.834 --> 09:43.709
and before you know it,
I'm rocking an orange onesie

09:43.750 --> 09:45.333
in the big house, and combing the lice

09:45.375 --> 09:47.208
out of my cellmate's back hair!

09:49.542 --> 09:52.667
Milton, we're talking about $500, bro.

09:53.291 --> 09:54.875
I can't risk getting caught.

09:54.959 --> 09:57.750
I couldn't even go to HeroCon
to meet my idol Don Mills,

09:57.834 --> 09:59.417
because Laser Blade is too famous.

09:59.500 --> 10:01.250
Well, now Laser Blade is dead.

10:01.291 --> 10:02.750
No one's ever gonna see him again!

10:05.625 --> 10:06.667
Well fine!

10:06.750 --> 10:07.917
Yeah, I don't need you.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.500
I'll go out on my own!

10:09.583 --> 10:10.709
Yeah, my father raised me

10:10.792 --> 10:13.250
to be a strong, independent Whoo-Man.

10:15.291 --> 10:17.375
Okay. Now I hear it.

10:31.041 --> 10:33.250
Citizens of Seaford,

10:33.291 --> 10:35.709
you all know me as the Laser Blade.

10:37.792 --> 10:40.417
But the man beneath the mask
is a righteous,

10:40.500 --> 10:42.834
humble, selfless hero.

10:43.667 --> 10:46.792
Jerry Martinez!

10:49.458 --> 10:51.208
No! No! What?

10:51.667 --> 10:54.208
Now, where's my 500 bucks?

11:03.959 --> 11:06.041

11:06.125 --> 11:07.583

ten pictures for you.

11:09.625 --> 11:11.041
Oh, this one's not for me.

11:11.125 --> 11:12.375

11:12.458 --> 11:13.667
He's a big fan.

for being the Laser Blade,

11:26.792 --> 11:27.625
why shouldn't I?

11:27.709 --> 11:29.750
Because it's dishonest,
disloyal, deceitful,

11:29.834 --> 11:31.458
conniving, and manipulative.

11:31.542 --> 11:33.291
Whoa, dude. That's a lot of big words

11:33.375 --> 11:34.959
flying at me pretty fast.

11:36.041 --> 11:37.667
I'm gonna tell people the truth.

11:37.750 --> 11:40.500
What? That you skipped school?

11:40.583 --> 11:42.709
Enjoy doing time in the big house.

11:43.750 --> 11:45.959
Oh, I can't believe you betrayed me

11:46.041 --> 11:48.542
and lied to all these people for $500.

11:48.583 --> 11:50.834
What... I didn't just do it for the money.

11:50.917 --> 11:52.250
I'm not that shallow.

11:52.667 --> 11:54.291
I also did it for the fame.

11:54.375 --> 11:57.166
Yeah, in fact, the Seaford Bugle
is doing a photo shoot of me tomorrow.

11:57.250 --> 11:58.583
Jerry, you're a total fake

11:58.667 --> 12:00.458
and you're taking advantage
of all these people.

12:00.542 --> 12:03.417
How dare you?

12:04.875 --> 12:07.083
I don't need to stand here
and listen to this.

12:07.166 --> 12:09.000
Laser Blade away!

12:10.083 --> 12:11.667
Where to, Laser Blade?

12:11.750 --> 12:14.917
Where the dark, ugly shadows
of crime lurk?

12:15.250 --> 12:17.750
Uh, actually I was thinking
more like the pizza parlor.

12:17.834 --> 12:20.125
You heard him, boys. Away!

12:20.792 --> 12:24.208
Laser Blade! Laser Blade!

12:34.458 --> 12:36.041
<i>♪ Surfing the lightning

12:36.125 --> 12:38.208

12:43.291 --> 12:44.458
What do you think you're doing?

12:44.542 --> 12:45.709
What I do every day.

12:45.792 --> 12:47.417
Making myself a workout smoothie.

12:47.500 --> 12:48.834
A little bit of carrots,

12:48.917 --> 12:50.417
bit of cucumber,

12:50.500 --> 12:51.625
some wheat grass.

12:51.709 --> 12:53.208
And while I wait for that,

12:53.291 --> 12:55.625
take a nice, big, healthy
shot of whipped cream.

12:55.709 --> 12:57.166
-
- You want some?

12:57.250 --> 12:58.709
Give me that.

12:58.792 --> 13:00.250
This is my juice bar.

13:00.333 --> 13:02.875
Well, your juice bar is in my dojo.

13:02.959 --> 13:04.959
Well, your hand is in a piece of pie.

13:08.333 --> 13:10.542
I have got to stop
leaning in dramatically.

13:15.041 --> 13:16.250
No, no, no.

13:16.333 --> 13:18.166
That's my cashmere scarf.

13:19.375 --> 13:21.667
This... this will never come out.

13:21.750 --> 13:23.083
It's ruined.

13:23.166 --> 13:24.458
-
- Wow.

13:24.542 --> 13:25.667
Chill out, Swathmore.

13:25.750 --> 13:28.375
I'm pretty sure a rich girl like you
can afford another stupid scarf.

13:28.458 --> 13:29.291
Rich?

13:29.417 --> 13:31.917
You think I'm a juice jockey
because it's fun?

13:32.875 --> 13:35.166
My dad's company went out of business,

13:35.250 --> 13:37.166
and I have to help my family out.

13:37.917 --> 13:40.083
Oh, yeah? Well, I did not know that

13:40.166 --> 13:41.750
when I was being mean to you.

13:43.792 --> 13:46.291
You know what?
I'll get a job somewhere else.

13:46.375 --> 13:47.625
Forget it.

13:47.709 --> 13:49.000
Tell Rudy I quit.

13:55.083 --> 13:56.083
Ooh!

13:56.166 --> 13:57.458
Isn't this exciting?

13:57.542 --> 13:59.875
<i>The Blade's photo shoot.</i>
- Hello, Seaford!

13:59.959 --> 14:01.792
The hero up there looking down on us,

14:01.875 --> 14:03.166
the helpless hordes.

14:04.041 --> 14:05.542
Especially you, hon.

14:08.583 --> 14:10.709
All right, here's what I'm thinking.

14:10.792 --> 14:12.166
I want to look humble,

14:12.250 --> 14:14.291
but, uh, way better than everyone else.

14:17.709 --> 14:19.500
Right. Getting it.

14:21.041 --> 14:23.458
Great. Loving it.

14:23.542 --> 14:24.834
Not as good.

14:24.917 --> 14:27.250
Bad. Hate it.

14:28.667 --> 14:30.250
Love it again.

14:31.250 --> 14:33.166
Dude, I'm not feeling it.

14:33.250 --> 14:35.583
You know what this needs
is a little danger.

14:36.333 --> 14:38.375
Let's get the Seaford Skyline behind me.

14:45.125 --> 14:46.917
Whoa, careful. There's no railing there.

14:47.625 --> 14:48.667
Railing?

14:48.750 --> 14:50.125
I'm a superhero, brah.

14:50.208 --> 14:52.166
I don't need any rail--

14:56.583 --> 14:57.667
The Blade's gonna fall!

14:57.750 --> 14:58.959
Somebody better help him.

14:59.041 --> 15:00.250
Excuse me.

15:00.333 --> 15:01.917
He's a superhero.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.709
I'm pretty sure he doesn't need help.

15:03.792 --> 15:05.083
Help! Help!

15:05.166 --> 15:06.875
I need lots of help!

15:07.709 --> 15:09.208
Oh. Look at that.

15:12.875 --> 15:15.000
Jerry, hang on! I'm coming!

15:15.083 --> 15:17.417
Oh, man, oh, man, oh, man.

15:22.291 --> 15:23.667
Come on, Laser Blade.

15:23.750 --> 15:25.000
Save yourself!

15:25.083 --> 15:27.792
Why don't you come up here
and save yourself, lady!

15:28.875 --> 15:30.291
Do not let go!

15:30.375 --> 15:32.500
Oh, really? I hadn't thought of that.

15:38.667 --> 15:40.667
Milton, hurry up. I'm slipping.

15:48.875 --> 15:49.875
Huh?

15:51.625 --> 15:52.750
Hey.

15:52.834 --> 15:54.125
I really can fly.

15:54.625 --> 15:55.959
I'm a superhero.

15:56.041 --> 15:57.834
Whoo--

16:03.083 --> 16:04.375
The cape's ripping, Jerry.

16:04.458 --> 16:07.667
I'm about to die and all you care about
is your stupid costume?

16:09.291 --> 16:11.583
I don't care about the cape, you lug nut.

16:11.667 --> 16:13.834
-
- Don't move.

16:13.917 --> 16:15.375
Don't plan on it.

16:23.750 --> 16:25.166
It's a geek!

16:25.250 --> 16:26.875
It's a dork!

16:26.959 --> 16:29.208
It's Super Nerd!

16:32.458 --> 16:33.750
Thank you.

16:37.333 --> 16:38.709
Laser Blade,

16:38.792 --> 16:40.291
what happened up there?

16:40.417 --> 16:42.041
I thought you were the hero.

16:42.375 --> 16:43.458
Uh...

16:47.375 --> 16:49.792
Wearing a costume doesn't make you a hero.

16:51.542 --> 16:53.583
Okay, the truth is I found this costume
in the garbage

16:53.667 --> 16:54.750
and I put it on.

16:55.291 --> 16:56.667
And I would take it off right now

16:56.750 --> 16:58.250
if I had anything on underneath it.

16:59.291 --> 17:00.959
Dude, that's my costume.

17:01.041 --> 17:02.333
Your costume?

17:05.750 --> 17:06.917
Yes.

17:07.333 --> 17:09.125
I am the Laser Blade.

17:12.500 --> 17:15.125
Dude, you know this means you're gonna
get detention for cutting class.

17:15.709 --> 17:17.125
Yes, and...

17:18.041 --> 17:19.500
it was wrong.

17:19.583 --> 17:22.458
But at least now
the world knows the truth.

17:24.709 --> 17:27.375
That I, Milton Krupnick,

17:27.375 --> 17:29.542
have a secret identity.

17:30.375 --> 17:32.083
Laser Blade away!

17:41.041 --> 17:42.625
Don't worry, I'm going.

17:44.208 --> 17:45.542
You know what, the good news is

17:45.625 --> 17:47.417
I never have to see you again.

17:48.583 --> 17:49.750
Except on the bus.

17:49.834 --> 17:51.375
And science and, of course, homeroom

17:51.458 --> 17:52.583
and math and our lockers are--

17:52.667 --> 17:54.000
Look, Taylor.

17:54.542 --> 17:57.375
Look, I'm really sorry about yesterday.

17:58.333 --> 17:59.458
So...

18:00.291 --> 18:01.250
I got you something.

18:03.041 --> 18:04.250
Here.

18:10.208 --> 18:11.709
A cashmere scarf.

18:12.125 --> 18:13.458
That was...

18:13.542 --> 18:14.917
That was really nice of you.

18:16.166 --> 18:17.667
I got you something, too.

18:18.959 --> 18:20.417
Really? What is it?

18:21.875 --> 18:23.667
It's your ceremonial black belt.

18:25.458 --> 18:26.667
After our fight yesterday,

18:26.750 --> 18:29.750
I may have accidentally put it on puree.

18:30.875 --> 18:32.166
For seven minutes.

18:33.750 --> 18:34.917
Anyway, goodbye.

18:35.542 --> 18:36.875
Hang on.

18:37.875 --> 18:40.542
We're never gonna see eye to eye
because you and I--

18:40.625 --> 18:42.709
Because you walk around here
like a big, sweaty baboon,

18:42.792 --> 18:45.583
carrying your... boo stick?

18:47.250 --> 18:48.375
It's a bo staff.

18:49.583 --> 18:52.208
Look, when I heard you were
from Swathmore,

18:53.000 --> 18:54.291
I may have misjudged you.

18:55.458 --> 18:56.583
And I want to let you know that

18:56.667 --> 18:59.208
it's not that I don't like you
because you came from money.

18:59.959 --> 19:02.000
I don't like you because you're annoying.

19:03.583 --> 19:04.583
I'm annoying?

19:04.667 --> 19:06.375
Admitting it is a great first step.

19:06.458 --> 19:08.667
Oh.

19:09.041 --> 19:11.291
Uh, and what you're doing for your family,

19:11.417 --> 19:13.041
it's, it's really cool.

19:15.041 --> 19:16.709
Would you consider coming back?

19:18.917 --> 19:21.542
I might be able to do that.

19:22.333 --> 19:23.750
I, I can't believe I'm saying this,

19:23.834 --> 19:27.125
but you might be a little nicer
than I thought.

19:27.208 --> 19:28.750
Oh.

19:28.834 --> 19:30.500
And you know, I could...

19:30.583 --> 19:32.041
I could really use the money, so...

19:32.125 --> 19:33.375
Uh...

19:37.500 --> 19:40.208
You used my tip money
to buy the scarf, didn't you?

19:42.625 --> 19:44.709
Cashmere's ridiculously expensive.

19:46.834 --> 19:49.125
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you ♪</i>

19:49.208 --> 19:51.333
So why are you so worried
about your friend Milton?

19:51.417 --> 19:53.667
I don't know.
He's never had detention before.

19:53.750 --> 19:55.083
I don't know if he's gonna survive it.

19:55.166 --> 19:56.500
I loved it!

19:57.792 --> 20:00.375
Detention was awesome!

20:01.500 --> 20:03.709
Three extra, glorious hours of school.

20:03.792 --> 20:05.375
It gave me a chance to do my homework.

20:05.458 --> 20:07.667
Then some of the nicest delinquents
you'd ever want to meet

20:07.750 --> 20:09.166
let me do theirs.

20:10.959 --> 20:12.208
Yo, Milton.

20:13.250 --> 20:14.250
Here you go.

20:14.709 --> 20:16.291
What's this?

20:16.375 --> 20:17.875
Well, I tracked down Don Mills

20:17.959 --> 20:21.083
and I told him how the Super Nerd
rescued me from the water tower.

20:21.166 --> 20:22.834
He was so impressed he made you this.

20:24.959 --> 20:26.583
- Dude, that is awesome.
- That's so cool.

20:26.667 --> 20:27.750
No way!

20:27.834 --> 20:29.458
I know the perfect place for this.

20:32.917 --> 20:35.542
Jerry, why'd you do this for me?

20:35.625 --> 20:37.333
What I did was wrong, bro.

20:37.917 --> 20:39.792
I shouldn't have taken credit
for something you did.

20:39.875 --> 20:40.875
Thanks, Jerry.

20:42.625 --> 20:43.917
Hey, guys. Check it out.

21:02.166 --> 21:03.834
It's picture day, Johnny.

21:03.917 --> 21:06.291
And you've got a cowlick.

21:06.417 --> 21:08.417
Oh, but I like my cowlick.

21:08.500 --> 21:09.792
It makes me special.

21:09.875 --> 21:12.834
I'll comb the special right out of you.

21:14.083 --> 21:15.709
Oh, is there no one that can help me?

21:15.792 --> 21:17.959
-
- Don't worry, Johnny.

21:18.041 --> 21:20.083
I'll get you out of this hairy situation.

21:20.166 --> 21:22.417
I'll use my calcu-laser.

21:27.250 --> 21:29.458
I guess Miss Kippler's plan just didn't...

21:29.542 --> 21:30.542
add up.

21:57.083 --> 21:57.959
<i>Poor soul.</i>

22:02.166 --> 22:03.000
<i>Yes!</i>
