WEBVTT

00:03.500 --> 00:07.926
Captain's log, star date 41590.5.

00:08.092 --> 00:11.642
Having dropped off Counsellor Troi
for a visit home,

00:11.808 --> 00:15.066
we were fortunately close
to the Sigma Ill system

00:15.233 --> 00:19.617
when its Federation colony made
an urgent call for medical help.

00:19.784 --> 00:23.793
An accidental explosion has
devastated a mining operation.

00:23.960 --> 00:25.881
Include a burn unit with each kit.

00:26.048 --> 00:29.931
Identify the most critically injured
and beam them to cargo bay six.

00:30.098 --> 00:33.856
- Dr. Crusher, this is the Captain.
- Dr. Crusher here.

00:34.023 --> 00:38.908
Additional information. The number
of colonists at the site is 504.

00:39.075 --> 00:42.374
- Are you prepared for that many?
- We believe so, sir.

00:42.541 --> 00:45.506
Captain, we are now at warp 9.1, sir.

00:45.673 --> 00:48.637
We will be at the colony
in 3.2 hours, sir.

00:50.057 --> 00:52.771
Schematics suggest
the explosion was caused

00:52.938 --> 00:56.029
by a methane-like gas
seeping in from underground.

00:56.195 --> 00:59.369
Captain, I'm picking up
a force field. It's...

01:06.968 --> 01:10.977
The Q entity. It's identical
to the grid we encountered...

01:11.144 --> 01:14.068
- It reads solid, sir.
- Emergency. Full stop.

01:14.234 --> 01:15.779
Reversing power, sir.

01:16.447 --> 01:18.117
Not now, damn it, Q.

01:18.284 --> 01:20.705
Shields and deflectors up, sir.

01:28.555 --> 01:30.477
Now reading full stop, sir.

01:32.231 --> 01:35.237
Humans. I thought by now
you'd have scampered back

01:35.404 --> 01:37.242
to your own little star system.

01:40.331 --> 01:44.590
If this is Q I'm addressing,
we are on a mission of rescue...

01:44.758 --> 01:48.975
We the Q have studied our contact
with you, and are impressed.

01:49.142 --> 01:50.729
We have much to discuss,

01:50.895 --> 01:55.238
including perhaps the realization
of your most impossible dream.

01:55.405 --> 02:00.249
Intriguing as that is, we are on
an urgent journey. After, perhaps...

02:00.416 --> 02:05.385
You will abandon it! My business
with you takes precedence.

02:06.261 --> 02:11.482
If my magnificence blinds you,
then perhaps something more familiar.

02:15.658 --> 02:18.788
Starfleet Admiral Q, at your service.

02:20.000 --> 02:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:42.381 --> 02:45.470
Space, the final frontier.

02:47.182 --> 02:51.108
These are the voyages
of the Starship Enterprise.

02:51.275 --> 02:55.366
Its continuing mission,
to explore strange new worlds,...

02:57.204 --> 03:00.879
..to seek out new life
and new civilizations,...

03:01.797 --> 03:05.472
..to boldly go
where no one has gone before.

04:08.230 --> 04:10.319
Captain's log, supplemental.

04:10.486 --> 04:14.745
Our rescue mission to Sigma Ill
has been halted by an immense grid

04:14.912 --> 04:17.959
and an untimely visit from Q.

04:19.045 --> 04:21.718
You're no Starfleet Admiral, Q.

04:21.843 --> 04:27.020
Neither am I an Aldebaran serpent,
Captain, but you accepted me as such.

04:27.188 --> 04:29.108
He's got us there, Captain!

04:29.275 --> 04:32.825
The redoubtable Cmdr Riker,
whom I noticed before.

04:32.992 --> 04:35.372
You seem to find this
all very amusing.

04:35.539 --> 04:40.591
I might, if we weren't on our way to
help some suffering, dying humans...

04:40.758 --> 04:43.597
Your species
is always suffering and dying.

04:43.764 --> 04:48.108
No, Lt. Worf! Make no move
against him unless I order it.

04:49.318 --> 04:52.909
Pity! You might have learned
an interesting lesson.

04:53.076 --> 04:56.458
Macro head with a micro brain!

04:58.379 --> 05:05.311
You said you had the realization
of impossible dreams to offer us.

05:06.646 --> 05:10.740
When this rescue is completed,
I will listen to your proposal.

05:10.907 --> 05:13.161
Subject to its being acceptable...

05:13.328 --> 05:17.962
Subject to foolish human values?
Picard, why do you distrust me so?

05:18.547 --> 05:23.057
Why? At our first meeting,
you seized my vessel.

05:23.225 --> 05:25.897
You condemned all humans as savages

05:26.064 --> 05:30.531
and tried us in a post-atomic
21st-century court of horrors,

05:30.698 --> 05:33.664
attacked my people
and again seized my vessel!

05:33.830 --> 05:37.838
And that angered you?
"Seized my vessel!"

05:38.005 --> 05:40.928
You interfered with
our Farpoint mission.

05:41.096 --> 05:44.561
You threatened to convict us
as ignorant savages,

05:44.727 --> 05:47.651
if, while dealing with
a powerful life form,

05:47.818 --> 05:50.700
we made any mistake,
and when we didn't...

05:50.866 --> 05:53.122
The Q became interested in you.

05:53.289 --> 05:56.796
Does no one here understand
your good fortune?

05:56.963 --> 05:58.842
"Seized my vessel!"

05:59.009 --> 06:01.097
The complaints of a closed mind,

06:01.264 --> 06:03.978
too accustomed
to military privileges.

06:05.732 --> 06:10.908
But you, Riker, and I remember you
well, what do you make of my offer?

06:11.075 --> 06:13.582
We don't have time for these games.

06:14.499 --> 06:18.383
Games? Did someone say games?

06:19.303 --> 06:23.269
And, perchance for interest's sake,
a deadly game?

06:25.774 --> 06:27.779
To the game.

06:36.881 --> 06:38.092
Where are we?

06:43.103 --> 06:47.529
A Class-M world. Gravity
and oxygen within our limits.

06:48.739 --> 06:52.038
Twin moons. Where are we?

06:53.876 --> 06:59.305
Considering the power demonstrated
by Q the last time,... anywhere.

07:00.306 --> 07:02.477
Assuming this place even exists.

07:02.644 --> 07:07.989
But it won't be boring.
If Q is anything, he's imaginative.

07:08.156 --> 07:10.871
Seems our Captain
wasn't meant to be here.

07:12.540 --> 07:14.545
Security, this is the Captain.

07:16.089 --> 07:17.677
Security?

07:20.892 --> 07:23.104
Engineering, this is the bridge.

07:54.087 --> 07:56.300
Turbo lift control, do you read?

07:57.219 --> 07:58.807
This is the Captain.

08:04.944 --> 08:06.531
Sir! Over there!

08:07.658 --> 08:11.542
Join me, Riker. A good game
needs rules and planning.

08:12.878 --> 08:14.715
Didn't your own Hartley say,

08:14.883 --> 08:18.223
"Nothing reveals humanity so well
as the games it plays"?

08:19.768 --> 08:21.480
Almost right.

08:21.647 --> 08:25.113
Actually, you reveal yourselves
best in how you play.

08:29.163 --> 08:33.464
Sir, what he has in mind might
provide us with vital information.

09:02.150 --> 09:06.951
Incredible. I was just thinking
about an old-fashioned lemonade.

09:07.787 --> 09:12.005
And so it became that.
An excellent thirst-quencher.

09:12.172 --> 09:14.927
It gets rather hot
out here on this plain.

09:15.094 --> 09:16.890
What about my people?

09:17.056 --> 09:19.270
Whatever they'd like, of course.

09:38.478 --> 09:40.272
"Drink not with thine enemy."

09:40.439 --> 09:45.201
The rigid Klingon code. That explains
something of why you defeated them.

09:47.497 --> 09:52.590
Still fascinated with the human past?
Perhaps you're not that original.

09:52.758 --> 09:56.139
Au contraire. It's the human future
which intrigues us.

09:56.306 --> 09:58.645
And it should concern you the most.

09:58.812 --> 10:02.404
Of all the species,
yours cannot abide stagnation.

10:02.571 --> 10:06.997
Change is the heart of what you are.
But into what? That's the question.

10:07.163 --> 10:10.379
That is what humans call... a truism.

10:10.546 --> 10:15.472
- You mean hardly original?
- You're the one who said it.

10:15.640 --> 10:20.150
While we're at it,...
this isn't part of any human future.

10:20.317 --> 10:24.159
True. I borrowed this
from your stodgy Captain's mind.

10:24.326 --> 10:27.290
This is the dressing
for a game we will play.

10:27.457 --> 10:30.129
Now, games require rules, rewards,

10:30.254 --> 10:33.386
dangers, familiar settings.
That sort of thing.

10:33.553 --> 10:36.434
This isn't that familiar to me. Data?

10:37.561 --> 10:42.823
This is from Europe's Napoleonic era.
Late-18th, early-19th centuries.

10:42.990 --> 10:45.662
This is
a campaign-headquarters tent.

10:45.788 --> 10:48.710
His uniform is that
of a French Army marshal.

10:48.877 --> 10:50.674
Outranking even an admiral.

10:50.840 --> 10:54.515
Would I go from a Starfleet admiral
to anything else?

10:54.682 --> 10:56.477
Of course you wouldn't.

10:57.186 --> 10:59.985
But Napoleonic equipment
on an alien planet,

11:00.151 --> 11:02.490
one so different it has twin moons?

11:02.657 --> 11:05.539
As you said,
I am nothing if not imaginative.

11:05.706 --> 11:07.668
The game should reflect that.

11:07.835 --> 11:13.179
Shall it be a test of strength?
Meaningless, since you have none.

11:13.347 --> 11:17.772
A test of intelligence, then?
Equally as meaningless!

11:17.940 --> 11:22.742
But it needs risk, something to win.
And something to lose.

11:23.284 --> 11:26.750
If we must play a game,
what would we win?

11:26.916 --> 11:30.299
The greatest possible future
you can imagine.

11:30.467 --> 11:34.016
Which requires something
totally disastrous if you lose.

11:34.183 --> 11:36.688
The point of this game shall be,

11:36.855 --> 11:39.527
can any of you stay alive?

11:39.695 --> 11:42.575
If your game is fair, we will.

11:43.202 --> 11:45.122
For shame, Worf!

11:45.290 --> 11:49.256
Fairness is such a human concept.
Think imaginatively!

11:49.423 --> 11:53.098
This game shall in fact be...
completely unfair.

11:53.265 --> 11:56.397
- You've gone too far!
- Game penalty!

11:59.946 --> 12:03.203
Where is she, Q?
You can forget your game...

12:03.370 --> 12:06.836
To use a 20th-century term,
she's in a penalty box.

12:07.004 --> 12:11.012
She'll remain there unharmed
unless one of you merits a penalty.

12:11.178 --> 12:13.599
Unfortunately, there's only one box.

12:13.766 --> 12:17.735
If any of you are sent there,
dear Tasha must give the box up.

12:17.901 --> 12:19.947
And where does she go?

12:20.573 --> 12:22.453
Into nothingness!

12:23.329 --> 12:26.085
I entreat you to obey
the rules of the game.

12:26.252 --> 12:31.388
The only one who can destroy
your Tasha now is you.

12:59.030 --> 13:00.325
Captain's log...

13:04.584 --> 13:07.005
Damn it.
I can't even make a log entry.

13:08.134 --> 13:10.346
I wish I could help you, Captain.

13:13.102 --> 13:14.731
Where is everyone else?

13:15.859 --> 13:17.319
Down on some planet.

13:17.486 --> 13:20.410
- Some planet? Why are you here?
- Well, l...

13:22.999 --> 13:24.710
It sounds strange...

13:25.879 --> 13:28.469
..but, I'm in a penalty box.

13:28.635 --> 13:30.515
A penalty box?

13:30.682 --> 13:35.817
Q's penalty box. It sounds strange,
but it definitely isn't.

13:36.611 --> 13:38.949
I know that one more penalty,...

13:39.951 --> 13:43.375
..by anyone,... and I'm gone.

13:43.542 --> 13:46.089
- Gone?
- Yes! I am gone!

13:49.722 --> 13:53.773
It is so frustrating
to be controlled like this!

13:56.863 --> 13:58.991
Lieutenant...

13:59.159 --> 14:01.080
Tasha, it's alright.

14:02.834 --> 14:06.299
What in the hell am I doing?
Crying?!

14:08.888 --> 14:10.474
Don't worry.

14:12.229 --> 14:14.817
There is a new standing order
on the bridge.

14:14.984 --> 14:19.451
When one is in the penalty box,
tears are permitted.

14:23.084 --> 14:24.672
Captain...

14:27.051 --> 14:29.056
If you weren't a captain...

14:29.891 --> 14:32.814
Consorting with lower-rank females?

14:33.315 --> 14:38.159
Especially ones in penalty boxes?
Destructive to discipline, they say.

14:38.743 --> 14:41.958
But then again, you're what?
Only human.

14:42.501 --> 14:45.466
Penalty... over.

14:56.698 --> 14:58.494
A marshal of France?

14:59.621 --> 15:01.291
Ridiculous!

15:01.458 --> 15:04.507
One takes the jobs he can get.

15:04.674 --> 15:10.019
For example,
star log entry, star date today.

15:10.895 --> 15:14.779
This is Q speaking
for Capt Jean-Luc Picard,

15:14.946 --> 15:19.037
who we consider too bound
by Starfleet customs and traditions

15:19.205 --> 15:21.293
to be useful to us.

15:21.460 --> 15:26.053
The Enterprise is now helpless,
stuck like an Earth insect in amber,

15:26.220 --> 15:31.397
while its bridge crew plays out
a game, whose real intent is to test

15:31.564 --> 15:37.118
whether the First Officer is worthy
of the greatest gift the Q can offer.

15:37.285 --> 15:40.042
So, you're taking on Riker this time.

15:40.960 --> 15:43.841
Excellent.
He'll defeat you, just as I did.

15:44.008 --> 15:48.851
Shall we wager on that?
Your starship command against...

15:49.019 --> 15:52.818
Against your keeping out of
humanity's path for ever!

15:53.487 --> 15:56.743
- Done?
- Done. You've already lost.

15:56.911 --> 16:00.919
Riker will be offered something
impossible to refuse.

16:15.826 --> 16:17.621
Geordi, can you see Worf?

16:17.788 --> 16:21.087
I'd see the freckles on his nose
if he had them, sir.

16:21.254 --> 16:22.757
He's at the third ridge.

16:22.924 --> 16:24.511
The third ridge?

16:24.678 --> 16:26.265
Moving well, too.

16:28.769 --> 16:31.025
Good. He sees them.

17:06.768 --> 17:10.983
Listen to me, Q. You seem
to have some need for humans.

17:11.779 --> 17:13.907
Concern regarding them.

17:14.075 --> 17:17.749
Why do you demonstrate it
through this confrontation?

17:17.915 --> 17:22.050
Why not a simple, direct explanation,
a statement of what you seek?

17:22.217 --> 17:24.013
Why these games?

17:24.638 --> 17:27.563
Why these games?
Why, the play's the thing!

17:27.730 --> 17:32.156
I'm surprised you need ask. Your
human Shakespeare explained it all.

17:32.322 --> 17:34.661
He did
but don't depend on one view...

17:34.828 --> 17:37.917
A pity you don't know
the content of your own library.

17:38.085 --> 17:40.256
Hear this, and reflect.

17:41.258 --> 17:43.972
"All the galaxy's a stage..."

17:44.139 --> 17:47.063
World, not galaxy.
"All the world's a stage."

17:47.229 --> 17:51.029
You know it. If he were
living now, he'd have said galaxy.

17:51.196 --> 17:55.956
How about this?
"Life is but a walking shadow,

17:56.123 --> 18:00.758
a poor player that struts
and frets his hour upon the stage

18:00.926 --> 18:03.263
and then is heard no more."

18:04.057 --> 18:06.646
"It is a tale told by an idiot,

18:06.813 --> 18:10.988
full of sound and fury,
signifying nothing."

18:11.781 --> 18:15.790
I see. So how we respond to a game
tells you more about us

18:15.957 --> 18:20.926
than our real life?
This... tale told by an idiot.

18:21.094 --> 18:22.263
Interesting.

18:22.430 --> 18:26.312
Thank you. Glad you enjoyed it.
Perhaps a little Hamlet?

18:26.479 --> 18:31.658
I know Hamlet. What he might say
with irony, I say with conviction.

18:31.825 --> 18:36.251
"What a piece of work is man.
How noble in reason."

18:36.418 --> 18:38.045
"How infinite in faculty."

18:38.213 --> 18:41.596
"In form, in moving,
how express and admirable."

18:41.763 --> 18:46.690
"In action, how like an angel.
In apprehension, how like a god."

18:47.817 --> 18:50.197
You don't see your species like that?

18:50.363 --> 18:53.579
I see us one day becoming that, Q.

18:54.832 --> 18:56.920
Is it that which concerns you?

19:04.520 --> 19:08.820
Those soldiers have formed
a skirmishing line, I think it is.

19:08.986 --> 19:11.368
And they're headed this way.

19:11.535 --> 19:14.040
Armed with ball-and-powder muskets?

19:14.207 --> 19:16.127
That's what they look like, sir.

19:16.294 --> 19:20.302
Muskets are appropriate to the
1790-1800 French uniform, sir.

19:20.469 --> 19:22.934
But it is hardly a weapon
by our standards.

19:23.101 --> 19:27.610
A lead ball propelled by gunpowder.
100 meters at best, with accuracy.

19:27.777 --> 19:32.621
Against phasers? Just one phaser
could finish off an entire regiment.

19:32.788 --> 19:37.423
Except that it hardly sounds like Q
to give us an advantage like that.

19:38.675 --> 19:40.346
Unless...

19:47.527 --> 19:48.822
Drop your weapons!

19:49.490 --> 19:53.750
That was me, Worf. I was checking
that the phasers still operate.

19:55.169 --> 19:57.966
Incredible. He came out of nowhere.

19:59.429 --> 20:00.806
A warrior's reaction.

20:00.973 --> 20:03.020
Report. What did you find?

20:03.187 --> 20:08.239
They may wear old Earth uniforms,
but they aren't human at all.

20:09.032 --> 20:11.204
More like vicious animal things.

20:17.424 --> 20:20.098
Those soldiers
are moving in fast, sir.

20:23.187 --> 20:26.904
Data, if you've got a theory
about what's happening...

20:29.492 --> 20:32.583
Think fast, Cmdr Riker,
and move fast.

20:45.611 --> 20:47.740
Those aren't muskets!

20:53.586 --> 20:57.594
You have one chance to save them.
Send them back to the ship.

20:58.262 --> 20:59.806
You'll let me beam them?

20:59.973 --> 21:03.607
Send them the same way I do.
I've given you the power.

21:03.774 --> 21:07.615
Do you understand?
I've given you the power of the Q.

21:08.451 --> 21:09.620
Use it.

21:15.006 --> 21:16.635
Use your power.

21:23.775 --> 21:25.362
Use your power.

22:00.519 --> 22:03.860
Lieutenant, take the conn position.
Engineering?

22:04.027 --> 22:07.201
- Engineering, sir.
- Are all systems back on line?

22:07.368 --> 22:09.832
Back on line, sir?
They were never off.

22:13.089 --> 22:15.552
Captain, you'd better look at this.

22:16.554 --> 22:21.315
There's been no interruption in
course or speed. Both are constant.

22:21.482 --> 22:23.653
It's as though we never stopped.

22:25.031 --> 22:26.826
We never did, Lieutenant.

22:27.954 --> 22:30.125
Q suspended time.

22:35.679 --> 22:38.935
- Where's Cmdr Riker?
- He was with us.

22:39.102 --> 22:41.232
He must still be on the planet.

22:41.942 --> 22:45.825
We were under attack
by these... animal things.

22:46.535 --> 22:51.046
- Animal things?
- Maybe Data can explain better, sir.

22:52.381 --> 22:56.306
You may find it aesthetically
displeasing. I'll file a report.

22:56.473 --> 22:57.224
Data...

22:57.391 --> 23:00.857
Sir, the important thing is
why is Cmdr Riker missing?

23:01.024 --> 23:05.033
Understood. But I suspect
Cmdr Riker is perfectly safe,

23:05.200 --> 23:07.121
at least in a physical sense.

23:07.705 --> 23:10.796
Q has an interest in him.

23:10.962 --> 23:14.595
In fact, Q's entire visit
concerns our First Officer.

23:14.762 --> 23:17.894
- And the reason for that, sir?
- I wish I knew.

23:18.061 --> 23:21.443
Q first became interested in him
at Farpoint.

23:21.610 --> 23:23.614
I have no idea what it means.

23:23.781 --> 23:27.163
Meanwhile, we must proceed
with our rescue mission.

23:45.744 --> 23:49.920
Something amuses you? Perhaps
you'll share the joke with me.

23:50.087 --> 23:51.423
The joke is you!

23:52.176 --> 23:54.221
Strange gratitude,

23:54.388 --> 23:58.898
from one who has been granted a gift
beyond any human dream.

24:02.071 --> 24:06.748
How can you not appreciate being able
to send your friends to their ship,

24:06.915 --> 24:11.217
or send the soldiers back to the
nothingness from which they came?

24:11.926 --> 24:16.435
You must understand that you can
send yourself back to the ship,

24:16.602 --> 24:20.569
or to Earth, or change your shape,
become anything you want to be.

24:20.736 --> 24:23.660
- What do you need?
- Need?

24:23.827 --> 24:26.499
You want something from us.
Desperately.

24:26.624 --> 24:31.467
Want something from you foolish,
fragile nonentities? Come, Riker!

24:31.677 --> 24:34.391
You sound like your Captain.

24:34.558 --> 24:37.606
Now, that's a compliment, Q,
but not an answer.

24:43.660 --> 24:48.796
Riker, we have offered you a gift
beyond all other gifts!

24:49.715 --> 24:51.719
Out of the goodness of your heart.

24:56.898 --> 25:02.158
After Farpoint, I returned
to where we exist, the Q Continuum.

25:02.325 --> 25:03.995
Which means what?

25:04.162 --> 25:07.961
The limitless dimensions
of the galaxy in which we exist.

25:08.129 --> 25:11.219
- I don't understand.
- Of course you don't.

25:11.385 --> 25:14.601
And you never will,
until you become one of us.

25:14.768 --> 25:18.025
Until? Would you mind
going over that again?

25:19.236 --> 25:21.783
If you'd stop interrupting me!

25:21.951 --> 25:26.794
This is hardly a time to be teaching
you the true nature of the universe.

25:28.840 --> 25:30.343
However...

25:31.680 --> 25:36.189
At Farpoint,...
we saw you as savages only.

25:36.899 --> 25:40.490
We discovered instead
that you are unusual creatures,...

25:41.366 --> 25:44.540
..in your own limited ways.

25:45.250 --> 25:48.257
Ways which, in time,
will not be so limited.

25:48.424 --> 25:50.511
We're growing.

25:50.679 --> 25:54.895
Something about us
compels us to learn, explore.

25:55.062 --> 25:56.941
Yes, the human compulsion.

25:57.108 --> 26:00.407
Unfortunately for us,
this power will grow stronger,

26:00.574 --> 26:03.247
century after century,
a eon after a eon.

26:03.414 --> 26:08.174
A eons... Have you any idea
how far we'll advance?

26:08.341 --> 26:13.561
Perhaps in a future that you cannot
yet conceive, even beyond us.

26:14.520 --> 26:18.237
You see, we must know more
about this human compulsion.

26:18.738 --> 26:22.162
That's why we selected you
to become part of the Q,

26:22.329 --> 26:25.503
so you can bring to us
this human need and hunger,

26:25.670 --> 26:27.924
that we may better understand it.

26:28.343 --> 26:31.139
I suppose that's meant
as a compliment.

26:32.685 --> 26:35.232
Or maybe it's my limited mind.

26:35.399 --> 26:37.821
But to become a part of you?

26:38.530 --> 26:39.909
I don't even like you.

26:41.662 --> 26:43.667
You're gonna miss me.

26:56.277 --> 26:58.239
Come on! Not again!

27:07.133 --> 27:11.351
Cmdr Riker, what's going on?
I was sitting in school and...

27:11.517 --> 27:14.232
Worf! My phaser's gone.
Are you armed?

27:15.443 --> 27:16.445
No.

27:21.246 --> 27:24.921
Where is Q? lf you have an answer
to any of this...

27:57.825 --> 27:58.994
Look out!

27:59.161 --> 28:00.664
Wesley! No!

28:04.715 --> 28:05.967
No, damn it!

28:06.134 --> 28:07.805
Damn it to hell!

28:11.980 --> 28:13.065
You... !

28:13.232 --> 28:15.571
You did that!

28:16.448 --> 28:18.034
And that's not all!

28:33.943 --> 28:36.156
That grid, their wounds...

28:37.701 --> 28:39.705
Only the Q can do that.

28:49.519 --> 28:52.900
Captain's log, star date 4159 1.4.

28:53.067 --> 28:55.531
12 minutes out
from Quadra Sigma Ill,

28:55.698 --> 28:59.038
where the survivors of a disaster
desperately need us.

28:59.205 --> 29:02.463
On the Enterprise,
First Officer William T Riker

29:02.629 --> 29:04.718
needs help nearly as badly.

29:04.885 --> 29:08.435
But this is a subject
far out of my experience.

29:08.602 --> 29:10.981
Out of any human's experience.

29:17.161 --> 29:19.290
How the hell do I advise you?

29:20.835 --> 29:23.508
You know the implications
as well as l.

29:25.428 --> 29:29.020
No one has ever offered
to turn me into a god before.

29:29.604 --> 29:33.487
What the Q has offered you
has to be close to immortality.

29:33.655 --> 29:36.452
It's no lie
about controlling time and space.

29:36.619 --> 29:40.461
- We've seen it in what they can do.
- And in what I can do.

29:41.379 --> 29:45.513
If you are to refuse his offer,
you must not use this power again.

29:45.680 --> 29:49.563
It's too great a temptation
at our present stage of development.

29:49.730 --> 29:51.776
You fear I won't be able to say no?

29:51.944 --> 29:57.706
You tell me. Are you strong enough
to refuse to use that power?

29:57.873 --> 29:58.917
Certainly.

29:59.084 --> 30:02.925
No matter how tempted?
No matter how difficult Q makes it?

30:05.096 --> 30:06.767
You have my word.

30:07.476 --> 30:10.567
Good. I know what your word means.

30:10.734 --> 30:12.863
In orbit of Quadra Sigma Ill.

30:13.030 --> 30:17.332
Ready to beam down rescue team
to underground emergency area.

30:31.527 --> 30:33.282
This way, sir.

30:51.863 --> 30:53.867
Are there any others?

30:54.034 --> 30:56.581
Gone. It's just us.

31:04.098 --> 31:05.684
Commander!

31:10.653 --> 31:12.866
There's somebody under here!

31:23.263 --> 31:25.184
You're getting close, Data.

31:42.262 --> 31:45.228
It's too late. She's dead.

31:48.860 --> 31:51.532
If only we'd gotten here
a little sooner.

31:52.827 --> 31:56.292
Sir, if indeed
you have the power of Q...

31:59.924 --> 32:03.976
I don't understand. Certainly
you can't bring her back to life.

32:04.143 --> 32:08.610
I can't. I'm prevented from that
by a promise.

32:34.375 --> 32:39.385
I was wrong to make that agreement.
I could have saved that child.

32:39.551 --> 32:44.520
You were right not to try. Once you
get accustomed to that power...

32:44.687 --> 32:48.027
When I used it before,
I saved most of our bridge crew!

32:48.195 --> 32:50.742
And when you grow to like it
too much?

32:51.786 --> 32:53.958
As soon as it's convenient,

32:54.125 --> 32:56.879
I want a meeting with you
and your bridge staff.

32:57.046 --> 33:00.178
As soon as we are secure
with this rescue operation,

33:00.345 --> 33:03.102
I'll discuss all
that this new power...

33:29.700 --> 33:31.914
We can confer here,
if no one objects.

33:32.080 --> 33:35.463
The bridge is fine.
I've called the entire staff.

33:35.630 --> 33:38.636
Correction.
Knowing the decision you face,

33:38.803 --> 33:41.350
I have permitted you this gathering.

33:42.018 --> 33:43.313
Of course, Jean-Luc.

33:52.541 --> 33:54.671
Wesley, this meeting is not for you.

33:54.838 --> 33:58.177
Why not, sir? You helped
make me a bridge officer.

33:59.139 --> 34:01.183
Acting Ensign.

34:01.351 --> 34:03.230
Alright. He stays.

34:13.208 --> 34:17.636
Because I've been given unusual
powers, I'm not suddenly a monster.

34:17.803 --> 34:22.313
Except for these abilities,
and I don't yet know how far they go,

34:22.478 --> 34:25.695
I'm the same William T Riker
you've always known.

34:29.203 --> 34:30.580
Well?

34:34.755 --> 34:37.053
Everyone still looks uncomfortable.

34:37.971 --> 34:41.728
Perhaps they all remember
that saying, "power corrupts".

34:41.896 --> 34:44.860
And absolute power
corrupts absolutely.

34:45.027 --> 34:48.409
You believe I haven't thought
of that, Jean-Luc?

34:48.577 --> 34:53.003
And have you noticed how you and I
are now on a first-name basis?

34:54.464 --> 34:56.261
Number One.

34:56.427 --> 35:00.060
Will,...
something has happened already.

35:01.981 --> 35:03.568
In what way?

35:03.734 --> 35:07.743
Haven't you seen how much
I regretted not saving that child?

35:07.910 --> 35:11.209
Using the power of Q to save her
may not have been wrong.

35:11.376 --> 35:15.384
No more than it was wrong to save you
from those soldier things.

35:15.551 --> 35:20.270
Let's keep in mind that that
particular danger was invented by Q.

35:20.437 --> 35:25.196
What we represent to the Q,
Commander, are lowly animals,

35:25.363 --> 35:28.954
tormented into performing
for their amusement.

35:29.121 --> 35:31.711
Actually,
they think very highly of us.

35:32.880 --> 35:37.013
We have a quality of growth
which they admire.

35:37.180 --> 35:38.684
Or fear.

35:40.395 --> 35:44.279
No, we've learned the Q
do not admire us.

35:45.407 --> 35:47.410
The Q has muddled your mind.

35:47.954 --> 35:51.878
Don't you understand
his incredible gift to me?

35:53.131 --> 35:57.057
Are these truly your friends,
brother?

36:11.044 --> 36:15.555
Let us pray.
For understanding and for compassion.

36:15.722 --> 36:20.606
Let us do no such damn thing! What is
this need of yours for costumes?

36:20.773 --> 36:22.777
Have you no identity of your own?

36:22.944 --> 36:25.116
I come in search of the truth.

36:25.283 --> 36:28.206
You come in search
of what humanity is!

36:28.373 --> 36:30.711
I forgive your blasphemy!

36:36.432 --> 36:38.019
Don't you see, Riker?

36:38.186 --> 36:42.613
He's nothing but a flimflam man.
He has been since we met at Farpoint!

36:43.322 --> 36:44.867
Flimflam?

36:45.034 --> 36:47.414
You offer Riker jealousy.

36:47.581 --> 36:51.047
What I offer
is clearly beyond your comprehension.

36:51.214 --> 36:53.678
How can you claim
friendship for Riker,

36:53.844 --> 36:59.022
while obstructing the greatest
adventure ever offered a human?

36:59.189 --> 37:03.198
Obstructing? Then it's not certain.
He's not yet committed.

37:03.365 --> 37:06.831
The truly evil part of this
is your jealousy.

37:07.540 --> 37:10.130
You love each one of your people.

37:10.296 --> 37:13.344
Demonstrate it. You have the power

37:13.512 --> 37:17.520
to leave each one of them with a gift
proving your affection.

37:17.937 --> 37:22.781
There'd be no harm to give them
something I know they'd like?

37:23.783 --> 37:25.787
How touching!

37:25.954 --> 37:28.753
A plea to his former Captain.

37:28.919 --> 37:34.056
"May I please give happiness
to my friends, sir? Please, sir?"

37:36.978 --> 37:41.071
In fact, I authorize and support
your idea, Riker.

37:43.451 --> 37:47.125
Please, feel free to cooperate
with him if you wish.

37:49.505 --> 37:52.010
- Are you certain, sir?
- Quite certain.

37:52.177 --> 37:55.811
By all means,
demonstrate your gifts of affection.

37:58.608 --> 38:02.784
Don't be frightened. There is
no way I could harm any of you.

38:05.622 --> 38:07.502
Shall I guess your dreams?

38:12.262 --> 38:14.517
We'll leave now, Wesley.

38:14.684 --> 38:19.152
No! Wesley I may know best of all.
Our friendship, our long talks...

38:19.318 --> 38:20.905
No, please!

38:21.072 --> 38:24.203
Have your favourite wish,
my young friend.

38:27.920 --> 38:30.885
You're ten years older. A man!

38:38.985 --> 38:40.448
Not bad!

38:45.333 --> 38:46.752
No!

38:47.962 --> 38:49.090
No, sir.

38:49.257 --> 38:52.681
But it's what you've always wanted,
to become human.

38:53.391 --> 38:55.270
Yes, sir. That is true.

38:56.398 --> 39:01.659
But I never wanted to compound
one... illusion with another.

39:02.828 --> 39:05.416
It might be real to Q,...

39:06.168 --> 39:07.755
..perhaps even you, sir.

39:08.632 --> 39:10.636
But it would never be so to me.

39:11.556 --> 39:15.438
Was it not one of the Captain's
favourite authors who wrote,

39:15.605 --> 39:19.029
"This above all:
to thine own self be true"?

39:21.033 --> 39:24.040
Sorry, Commander, I must decline.

39:30.345 --> 39:34.438
And you, my friend.
I know what you want.

40:08.844 --> 40:11.516
You're as beautiful as I imagined.

40:12.602 --> 40:14.565
And more.

40:15.650 --> 40:18.072
Then we can throw away the visor?

40:22.540 --> 40:24.210
I don't think so, sir.

40:24.377 --> 40:27.049
The price is a little too high
for me.

40:27.634 --> 40:31.225
And... I don't like
who I'd have to thank.

40:37.780 --> 40:39.785
Make me the way I was.

40:43.418 --> 40:44.920
Please!

41:02.459 --> 41:04.838
Proud warrior Worf!

41:05.758 --> 41:08.429
Without a single tie
to his own kind.

41:57.743 --> 41:59.121
No!

42:01.209 --> 42:03.756
She is from a world now alien to me!

42:05.134 --> 42:08.432
Worf, is this your idea of sex?

42:09.101 --> 42:11.022
This is sex.

42:12.566 --> 42:15.155
But I have no place
for it in my life now!

42:15.699 --> 42:18.956
No place, micro brain?
What possesses you?

42:24.258 --> 42:27.515
Cmdr Riker, it's too soon for this.

42:27.682 --> 42:30.229
Is this because your mother objects?

42:30.397 --> 42:32.150
No.

42:34.906 --> 42:39.206
I just want to get there
on my own. Honest.

42:42.589 --> 42:46.096
But it's easier, boy!
Listen to Riker!

42:52.986 --> 42:54.865
How did you know, sir?

42:55.365 --> 42:57.245
I feel like such an idiot.

42:57.412 --> 42:59.750
Quite right. So you should.

43:05.179 --> 43:07.559
It's over.
You have no business here.

43:07.726 --> 43:09.605
You have destroyed yourself.

43:09.772 --> 43:12.069
- Pay off your wager.
- I recall none!

43:12.236 --> 43:15.868
Your fellow Q know you agreed
never to trouble humans again,

43:16.036 --> 43:19.460
just as they know you failed
to tempt a human to join you.

43:19.627 --> 43:21.672
No! lf I can do one more thing...

43:21.840 --> 43:25.973
I strongly suspect it's some
explaining you have to do now.

43:48.146 --> 43:49.524
Extraordinary!

43:49.691 --> 43:53.616
Captain, we are showing
that same hole in time again.

43:53.783 --> 43:57.875
Our instruments say we just
beamed back from our rescue mission.

43:58.042 --> 44:01.466
Sir, how is it that the Q can...

44:02.384 --> 44:06.560
..handle time and space so well,
and us so badly?

44:06.727 --> 44:08.899
Perhaps someday we will discover

44:09.066 --> 44:13.074
that space and time
are simpler than the human equation.

44:17.291 --> 44:19.838
No coordinates laid in, Number One?

44:20.882 --> 44:24.348
Yes, sir.
You have my coordinates, La Forge.

44:24.515 --> 44:26.018
Aye, sir.

44:26.185 --> 44:27.772
On the board.

44:33.200 --> 44:34.870
Engage.
