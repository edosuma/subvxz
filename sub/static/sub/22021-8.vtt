WEBVTT

00:01.084 --> 00:02.791
Previously on "Designated Survivor”...

00:02.920 --> 00:04.786
| didn't want to set off any alarm bells
unless I had to.

00:04.922 --> 00:05.832
You already have.

00:05.964 --> 00:08.422
By stonewalling a police investigation
into the murder of a contractor

00:08.550 --> 00:10.211
who allegedly bribed
the First Lady's mother?

00:10.344 --> 00:12.802
Allegedly, John. This is Lloyd.

00:12.930 --> 00:15.262
This is his last desperate act
to bring down the president.

00:15.390 --> 00:17.597
You subpoenaed the First Lady's
mother after we spoke?

00:17.726 --> 00:19.137
-Hannah--
-Why did you do it?

00:19.937 --> 00:22.599
Icarus Astrotech contract
with the Defense Department.

00:22.731 --> 00:23.937
For $3 billion.

00:24.066 --> 00:26.433
They landed it six months ago,
right after Lloyd's Pentagon hack,

00:26.568 --> 00:29.936
and the Icarus signatory is Eric Little,
who bribed the First Lady's mother,

00:30.072 --> 00:31.437
the guy who just turned up dead.

00:31.573 --> 00:33.814
"You're being subpoenaed
by John Foerstel"? For what?

00:33.951 --> 00:35.988
Foerstel's found
a Saint Lucian bank account

00:36.119 --> 00:40.408
set up by Eric Little six months ago...
in my name.

00:40.624 --> 00:42.160
You're the greatest thing
since sliced bread.

00:42.292 --> 00:45.034
And bread is great,
fundamentally great, like water.

00:45.170 --> 00:46.285
Or air.

00:46.922 --> 00:48.253
Or you.

00:58.392 --> 00:59.598
[knock on door]

00:59.726 --> 01:01.933
Sir, we're at 30 miles out.
We're about to go dark.

01:02.062 --> 01:04.974
-Okay.
-[door closes]

01:16.159 --> 01:17.866
Is that my Macallan?

01:17.995 --> 01:20.077
Well, it was a gift
from the Duke of Windsor,

01:20.205 --> 01:22.287
so technically, it's the
American people's Macallan,

01:22.416 --> 01:25.124
-and I am the American people.
-What can I do for you, Lyor?

01:25.252 --> 01:26.834
-Did it come off?
-Without a hitch.

01:26.962 --> 01:30.171
President is out of the country
for 48 hours and no one is the wiser.

01:30.299 --> 01:33.291
Good. You and Seth are gonna have
to be on your toes

01:33.427 --> 01:35.088
-to keep a lid on this.
-We got the memo, thanks.

01:35.220 --> 01:36.551
I'm saying if the press
trips to the fact

01:36.680 --> 01:38.170
that the President is halfway
around the world

01:38.307 --> 01:40.890
in a place where his persona
is decidedly non grata--

01:41.018 --> 01:42.884
-He could be in danger. Got it.
-If Congress finds out--

01:43.020 --> 01:45.011
-Lyor.
-My work here is done.

01:49.484 --> 01:51.691
-[Emily] Sorry I couldn't join you guys.
-Oh, don't worry about it.

01:51.820 --> 01:52.901
Well, the President's not here,

01:53.030 --> 01:55.738
so I need to grab the reins,
man the ramparts.

01:55.866 --> 01:57.072
Mix the metaphors.

01:57.200 --> 01:59.157
I'm just saying,
| want to meet your brother.

01:59.286 --> 02:02.699
And you will. Meantime, be kind
to the English language. It's our friend.

02:02.831 --> 02:04.822
-Later, Strunk and White.
-[cellphone beeps]

02:07.711 --> 02:11.579
So, you're dating your boss, huh?
How's that work?

02:11.715 --> 02:13.581
Mikey, tonight's about you, okay?

02:13.717 --> 02:15.924
My little brother
just killed the MCATSs.

02:16.053 --> 02:17.669
My big brother celebrates
by dragging me

02:17.804 --> 02:19.306
-to "Gotterdammerung.”
-[chuckles]

02:19.431 --> 02:22.674
-Yeah. I hate opera.
-I know. That's why I dragged you.

02:22.809 --> 02:24.061
Can we please get a drink now?

02:24.186 --> 02:26.928
Sure, maybe a nice gewurztraminer,
because after Brunnhilde--

02:27.064 --> 02:28.680
-Seth.
-[police siren chirps]

02:30.359 --> 02:31.565
I'm going 35.

02:33.528 --> 02:35.314
And riding the median.

02:40.202 --> 02:41.909
[exhales sharply]

02:42.037 --> 02:43.698
| don't work for the White House, okay?

02:43.830 --> 02:45.412
This will be on TMZ in 10 minutes.

02:45.540 --> 02:47.247
We don't know
if this guy's trophy hunting.

02:47.376 --> 02:49.208
Okay, just, uh,
don't say anything.

02:49.336 --> 02:51.043
Just let me handle this.

02:51.171 --> 02:54.539
[police radio chatter]

02:54.675 --> 02:56.586
Good evening, Officer.
Is there a problem?

02:56.718 --> 02:58.675
Step out of the vehicle, sir.

03:11.608 --> 03:12.769
Welcome to Bagram, Mr. President.

03:12.901 --> 03:14.357
It's an honor, General.

03:20.033 --> 03:22.650
-[man] Welcome, Mr. President.
-Mr. President.

03:27.749 --> 03:30.707
[cheers and applause]

03:34.381 --> 03:36.918
Thank you very much! Thank you!

03:37.050 --> 03:39.838
[cheers and applause continue]

03:39.970 --> 03:41.506
Oh, yeah!

03:41.638 --> 03:42.844
Thank you.

03:44.057 --> 03:47.425
Well, I was in the neighborhood,
so I thought I'd stop by.

03:47.561 --> 03:52.101
Truth is, I had to get out of Washington.
It's war there.

03:54.109 --> 03:55.144
Thank you.

03:56.319 --> 03:57.650
The reason I'm here is because

03:57.779 --> 04:01.522
| want to express my deepest gratitude
not only for myself,

04:01.658 --> 04:05.117
but on behalf of the American people,
for your incredible sacrifice and service.

04:05.245 --> 04:08.658
Each and every single one of you has
answered our nation's call to protect her.

04:08.790 --> 04:12.033
You are the front line
of America's longest-standing war.

04:12.169 --> 04:13.659
Now, some of you are new to Bagram,

04:13.795 --> 04:15.752
some of you have been here
for several tours,

04:15.881 --> 04:18.464
but America thanks
each and every one of you.

04:19.384 --> 04:23.002
Having said that, it is my honor
to be able to serve you breakfast today.

04:23.138 --> 04:26.347
-Where the hell is Harry?
-[cheers and applause]

04:27.142 --> 04:29.884
And I heard Harry just got
his first Michelin star.

04:30.020 --> 04:32.307
-Second, sir.
-[laughter]

04:32.439 --> 04:34.476
Let's hope I'm not the reason
you lose one of them.

04:34.608 --> 04:35.689
Come on, let's eat!

04:35.817 --> 04:36.852
Let's go!
[cheers and applause]

04:36.985 --> 04:39.522
Harry!
Great to meet you, Harry.

04:46.369 --> 04:47.700
There you go, son.

04:47.829 --> 04:49.820
-Thank you.
-Corporal, how long you been here?

04:49.956 --> 04:52.698
This is my second tour of duty,
sir, so four years.

04:52.834 --> 04:55.246
-Extra bacon for you.
-[chuckles] Thank you, sir.

04:55.378 --> 04:57.540
-So, you're from Boston?
-Yes, sir.

04:57.672 --> 04:59.709
-Does that make you a Red Sox fan?
-Yes, sir.

04:59.841 --> 05:01.252
No bacon for you, Private.

05:01.384 --> 05:03.716
Oh, come on, Mr. President.
He's a growing boy.

05:03.845 --> 05:05.927
Okay, fine. I'll make an exception
just this one time.

05:06.056 --> 05:08.047
[laughs]

05:08.183 --> 05:09.139
Thank you, sir.

05:10.894 --> 05:14.307
-You get back to Philly often?
-Uh, not as often as I'd like.

05:14.439 --> 05:16.100
Thank you, sir.
Waiting on my 20.

05:16.233 --> 05:19.442
20 years in this man's army.
How long you been away?

05:19.569 --> 05:20.900
Pretty much all of it, sir.

05:21.029 --> 05:22.440
-Are you married?
-Yes, sir.

05:22.572 --> 05:26.361
Maddy, high-school sweetheart.
She was a waitress when we met.

05:26.493 --> 05:28.780
You might say food brought us together.

05:28.912 --> 05:30.903
We always used to talk
about opening up a restaurant

05:31.039 --> 05:33.030
in Passyunk, serve the swells.

05:33.166 --> 05:35.908
Well, we're gonna have to work
on getting you back home to her soon.

05:36.044 --> 05:37.375
Mr. President.

05:37.504 --> 05:40.371
I've got some business
to take care of.

05:40.507 --> 05:42.965
Hey, would you mind whipping me
up something while I'm gone?

05:43.093 --> 05:44.583
What'll you have, sir?

05:45.679 --> 05:47.386
A taste of Philadelphia, Chef.

05:50.183 --> 05:51.173
She's waiting for you, sir.

05:51.309 --> 05:52.970
-Everything set?
-Yes, sir.

05:53.103 --> 05:54.764
-[keypad beeps]
-Mr. President.

05:54.896 --> 05:56.762
Thank you.

05:57.440 --> 05:58.350
Agent Wells.

05:58.483 --> 06:00.599
Mr. President,
welcome to Afghanistan.

06:00.735 --> 06:02.146
This is Kabul Station Chief Kevin Dean.

06:02.279 --> 06:05.943
-Agent Wells has told me a lot about you.
-And I can tell you a lot about her, sir.

06:06.074 --> 06:08.156
We had the pleasure of working
here together for four years

06:08.285 --> 06:09.741
before she left the Agency for the FBI.

06:09.870 --> 06:11.781
-She's the best there is.
-I agree with you.

06:11.913 --> 06:14.575
| know you both have been working hard
to lay the groundwork for this,

06:14.708 --> 06:16.290
so why don't you walk me through it?

06:17.294 --> 06:20.002
[Dean] We've been fighting this war
for the last 16 years, sir.

06:20.130 --> 06:23.498
2,200 American troops killed
in Afghanistan since 2001,

06:23.633 --> 06:25.249
20,000 wounded.

06:25.385 --> 06:28.127
Of the 98 U.S.-designated
terrorist organizations,

06:28.263 --> 06:30.095
20 of them operate here.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.180
40% of the country's
controlled by warlords.

06:32.309 --> 06:34.846
That's 3 million Afghans
living under insurgent control.

06:34.978 --> 06:36.594
Which brings us to our mission, sir.

06:36.730 --> 06:39.142
Mullah Fayad, Mullah Babhri:

06:39.274 --> 06:41.106
the two most powerful warlords
in Afghanistan.

06:41.234 --> 06:43.191
[Dean] And with U.S. backing,
one of them will

06:43.320 --> 06:45.527
consolidate power in this region
over the next few months.

06:45.655 --> 06:47.487
We can make them a trusted ally.

06:47.616 --> 06:49.527
The problem is, sir, chatter suggests

06:49.659 --> 06:51.991
that one of them is planning
a major attack on U.S. soil.

06:52.120 --> 06:54.202
We back the right horse,
he can help us stop it.

06:54.331 --> 06:55.821
-And we can finally bring our troops home.
-Yes sir.

06:55.957 --> 06:57.334
Unless we back the wrong horse.

06:57.459 --> 06:59.700
Then we bring a terrorist into the fold.

06:59.836 --> 07:01.793
So, all of our assets, all of our intel,

07:01.922 --> 07:04.129
and we still don't know
which one we can trust?

07:04.257 --> 07:05.122
No, sir.

07:06.092 --> 07:07.594
Well, I hope these meetings
help your people

07:07.719 --> 07:10.086
make the right call,
because if we get this wrong,

07:10.221 --> 07:13.509
we could be responsible
for our nation's next 9/11.

07:13.642 --> 07:15.974
[theme music]

07:25.946 --> 07:28.529
You're a sight for sore eyes.
Thanks for bailing me out.

07:28.657 --> 07:30.989
200 tabs of modafinil, Seth?

07:31.117 --> 07:32.824
It's a drug which
half the White House takes.

07:32.953 --> 07:35.741
-With a prescription.
-The search was illegal, Kendra.

07:35.872 --> 07:38.330
Maybe, but so were the drugs.

07:38.458 --> 07:41.917
Isn't this the part where you tell me
you're gonna help me get out of this?

07:42.045 --> 07:43.956
No, this is the part where I tell you

07:44.089 --> 07:46.296
you were in possession of enough
of a Schedule Ill drug

07:46.424 --> 07:48.415
that you are looking
at felony intent to distribute.

07:48.551 --> 07:50.542
For the pharmaceutical
equivalent of caffeine?

07:50.679 --> 07:52.261
| know, but it's a five-year minimum.

07:52.389 --> 07:54.551
That's what the sentencing
guidelines say.

07:58.186 --> 07:59.517
| don't know where to begin.

08:01.523 --> 08:02.558
What were you thinking?

08:02.691 --> 08:04.648
-Em...
-200 pills?

08:04.776 --> 08:06.107
| know. It was bad judgment.

08:06.236 --> 08:08.147
Bad judgment is a brown belt
with black shoes.

08:08.279 --> 08:10.111
-This was--
-Apocalyptically bad judgment.

08:10.240 --> 08:11.446
You work for the White House.

08:11.574 --> 08:13.906
A fact that I made sure to conceal
from the arresting officer.

08:14.035 --> 08:14.900
Seth.

08:15.036 --> 08:16.902
Em, I'm running out of ways
to say I'm sorry.

08:17.038 --> 08:19.200
-Improvise.
-Okay, look...

08:19.874 --> 08:21.785
| Know how compromising this is,

08:21.918 --> 08:23.704
but I would take it back if I could.

08:23.837 --> 08:27.250
Obviously I can't, so just tell me
what to do to fix this, and I'll fix it.

08:27.382 --> 08:30.090
You're on the bench until
this clears up; no briefings, no nothing.

08:30.218 --> 08:31.629
Low profile means no profile.

08:31.761 --> 08:33.422
-Okay.
-Okay.

08:33.554 --> 08:36.263
-Are you gonna loop the President in?
- I don't know.

08:36.390 --> 08:37.927
I'm just saying if, um...

08:38.058 --> 08:40.049
if we get it dismissed,
it's like it never happened.

08:41.813 --> 08:43.349
And I'm saying "I don't know."

08:47.652 --> 08:48.767
[door opens]

08:51.448 --> 08:52.779
| couldn't stand Oxford.

08:52.907 --> 08:54.523
The weather.

08:54.659 --> 08:57.697
It is my understanding that
the Afghan winters are even harsher.

08:57.829 --> 09:00.947
Yes. But at least here
there is sunlight.

09:01.082 --> 09:02.618
In England, there is not.

09:02.751 --> 09:05.664
Right. Of course.
[chuckles]

09:06.254 --> 09:07.995
I'm going to be honest with you.

09:08.131 --> 09:11.590
| believe that my predecessors
made their fair share of mistakes.

09:11.718 --> 09:13.834
The most obvious one to me

09:13.970 --> 09:16.177
is their failure to understand
your country's history.

09:16.306 --> 09:18.593
For thousands of years,
Afghanistan has relied

09:18.725 --> 09:20.011
on tribal leaders to govern.

09:20.143 --> 09:23.556
And to try and implement
a Western democracy

09:23.688 --> 09:27.022
without truly understanding that
was shortsighted

09:27.150 --> 09:29.482
and to many Afghans,
deeply disrespectful.

09:30.153 --> 09:32.110
For that, I am sorry.

09:32.447 --> 09:34.688
| would like to extend
my hand in partnership,

09:34.824 --> 09:38.192
but I need to know,
do |, in fact, have a partner?

09:38.328 --> 09:39.944
You don't with me, sir.

09:41.414 --> 09:43.405
Not as things stand.

09:44.292 --> 09:47.330
America devotes all its resources
to propping up a corrupt regime.

09:47.462 --> 09:49.373
A regime that, at least, fights terrorism.

09:49.506 --> 09:52.373
That uses your money to buy Ferraris
and bomb our children.

09:52.509 --> 09:54.500
Sir, both our nations have been
down this road before.

09:54.636 --> 09:56.798
Promises were made,
our money spent,

09:56.930 --> 09:58.466
yet everything
remained the same.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.054
What I'm interested in

10:00.183 --> 10:02.891
is whether or not we can work together
to effect meaningful change.

10:04.104 --> 10:05.344
There is a way.

10:06.606 --> 10:09.689
Changing hearts and minds
one person at a time

10:09.818 --> 10:11.650
takes generations.

10:11.778 --> 10:13.689
At least it used to.

10:13.822 --> 10:15.654
But I have a faster method.

10:15.782 --> 10:17.147
I'm listening.

10:17.283 --> 10:18.614
Technology.

10:18.743 --> 10:21.405
With just a few keystrokes,
| can compel millions;

10:21.538 --> 10:22.699
a new Arab Spring.

10:22.831 --> 10:26.369
-The old one led to an Arab Winter.
-Because the West didn't follow through.

10:26.501 --> 10:28.788
My people turn to extremism
out of desperation.

10:28.920 --> 10:30.911
So if we were to help reduce
the desperation...

10:31.047 --> 10:32.583
I'll reduce the extremism.

10:33.550 --> 10:35.291
And you can monitor me online,

10:35.426 --> 10:37.383
make sure I'm holding up
my end of the bargain.

10:38.596 --> 10:40.507
This is very promising.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.802
Mullah Bahri, thank you for your time.

10:42.934 --> 10:44.345
Ah, please.

10:44.477 --> 10:47.811
My followers refer to me
as Zowan Haleek, "The young one."

10:47.939 --> 10:50.180
Zowan Haleek. I like that.
And it is true.

10:50.316 --> 10:52.478
You are very young to lead so many.

10:52.610 --> 10:54.601
[chuckles] Yes.

10:54.737 --> 10:57.525
Because they know
if they want a future,

10:57.657 --> 10:59.739
they can't look to the past.

11:01.536 --> 11:04.779
[indistinct chatter,
helicopter blades whirring]

11:08.376 --> 11:10.367
[door closes, keypad beeps]

11:12.881 --> 11:14.997
Hey, Mike. I just need a minute
with the President.

11:15.133 --> 11:16.248
Regarding?

11:16.384 --> 11:18.421
Last-minute materials for
his meeting with Mullah Fayad.

11:18.553 --> 11:20.260
I'll see that he gets them.

11:21.556 --> 11:23.672
Okay, there's a couple of things
| want to download myself.

11:23.808 --> 11:25.515
-Is everything here?
-Yeah.

11:25.643 --> 11:29.011
-I'll see that he gets them.
-Okay.

11:35.028 --> 11:37.019
| got Seth's preliminary hearing
moved up.

11:37.155 --> 11:39.237
| know Judge Schroeder,
so I called her chambers,

11:39.365 --> 11:41.652
and she's willing to do me
a favor and seal the proceedings.

11:41.784 --> 11:43.320
Do you think we can get this kicked?

11:43.453 --> 11:45.945
Depends on the mood she's in,
depends on the cop.

11:46.080 --> 11:47.787
If this goes to trial,
it's front-page news,

11:47.916 --> 11:50.624
and that is the last thing we need
with the President out of town.

11:50.752 --> 11:52.117
We have another problem.

11:52.253 --> 11:53.994
The paperwork for Lyor's vetting
finally came in,

11:54.130 --> 11:57.122
and something came up,
something big.

12:01.846 --> 12:03.678
You've got to be kidding me.

12:05.600 --> 12:08.558
-You've been married six years?
-Only technically.

12:08.686 --> 12:11.724
Marriage is like pregnancy, Lyor.
You are or you aren't.

12:11.856 --> 12:14.018
-It's complicated.
-Un-complicate it.

12:15.276 --> 12:17.608
Julie and I were on and off.

12:17.737 --> 12:21.776
| was about to take a job in London,
so we went to Vegas, a last hurrah.

12:21.908 --> 12:24.525
We had those drinks -
you know, the iridescent blue ones.

12:24.661 --> 12:27.744
They come in the yard-long glasses.
The fluid dynamics are very interesting.

12:27.872 --> 12:29.078
Lyor.

12:30.124 --> 12:32.912
One thing led to another,
we wound up in this 24-hour chapel.

12:33.044 --> 12:35.160
-It was all a joke.
-Well, the IRS won't be laughing.

12:35.296 --> 12:36.627
You've been misfiling
your income taxes.

12:36.756 --> 12:40.670
-Fine. I'll pay a penalty.
-You owe $826,000.

12:40.802 --> 12:42.292
-Not fine.
-[Emily] No, it's not.

12:42.428 --> 12:44.681
You're looking at dozens
of penalties, accrued interest,

12:44.806 --> 12:46.422
and deductions that need
to be reversed.

12:46.557 --> 12:48.844
You can't work in the White House
and be a tax cheat.

12:48.977 --> 12:50.388
Have you and Julie lived together,

12:50.520 --> 12:52.807
held yourself out as man and wife,
shared finances?

12:52.939 --> 12:54.930
No, we're not really in touch.

12:55.066 --> 12:57.728
Okay, we can fix this if none of
the conjugal trappings apply. We'll argue

12:57.860 --> 12:59.601
-that the marriage was a sham one.
-An annulment.

12:59.737 --> 13:01.603
Yes, and the IRS will buy
that the marriage wasn't real

13:01.739 --> 13:03.241
if we get them the paperwork
immediately,

13:03.366 --> 13:04.948
which means the clock is ticking.

13:05.076 --> 13:07.443
[chuckles] I'll reach out to Julie.

13:07.578 --> 13:09.364
Give me her details.
I'll get the ball rolling.

13:09.497 --> 13:11.363
-I need you to handle briefings for Seth.
-Why?

13:11.499 --> 13:13.365
Because he suddenly has
a legal problem, too,

13:13.501 --> 13:15.367
a serious one,
and we need to cover for him,

13:15.503 --> 13:17.915
and no one knows more about what's going
on in the White House than you.

13:18.047 --> 13:20.425
-So I'm Press Secretary?
-For today.

13:22.510 --> 13:24.547
I'm Press Secretary.

13:24.679 --> 13:25.840
Hmm.

13:30.310 --> 13:32.551
Thank you for the sugar, Mr. President.

13:32.687 --> 13:35.896
The more sugar, the more honor.
And you are a man deserving of much.

13:36.024 --> 13:37.185
As are you.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.524
| was hoping that we could
strike a deal

13:39.652 --> 13:41.393
that would be honorable
to both of us.

13:41.529 --> 13:43.440
This cycle of violence must stop.

13:43.573 --> 13:44.734
It will...

13:44.866 --> 13:46.948
if your soldiers leave my country.

13:47.076 --> 13:49.568
If you were to expel the terrorists
that have planted their flags here

13:49.704 --> 13:53.242
and close the madrasas that teach
your children to hate America,

13:53.374 --> 13:55.035
we would gladly do just that.

13:55.752 --> 13:57.538
What are you offering?

13:57.670 --> 14:00.048
To begin with,
money and logistical support.

14:00.173 --> 14:02.335
I've been offered these things before.

14:02.467 --> 14:05.676
There's water in the well,
but it quickly runs dry.

14:05.803 --> 14:09.012
There's an old Pashtun proverb:

14:09.140 --> 14:12.883
"It's the same donkey,
but with a new saddle."

14:13.019 --> 14:14.760
[laughs]

14:14.896 --> 14:16.887
There is an American proverb:

14:17.023 --> 14:19.731
"Those who fail to learn from the past
are doomed to repeat it."

14:19.859 --> 14:21.475
You dismiss the past.

14:22.236 --> 14:26.195
My family has lived in the same village
for 800 years.

14:27.408 --> 14:29.900
This country is rooted in tradition.

14:30.036 --> 14:31.993
With all due respect, sir, you're wrong.

14:32.121 --> 14:35.364
| have great respect for your country's
history and its traditions.

14:35.500 --> 14:38.993
Then why did you meet with someone
who has no respect for them?

14:39.128 --> 14:40.209
Mullah Bahri.

14:40.338 --> 14:42.875
An infidel and a liar.

14:43.007 --> 14:45.795
Now, how can I find
common ground

14:45.927 --> 14:49.716
with someone who consorts
with a man like that?

14:49.847 --> 14:52.100
Would you not agree
if one is to play the game,

14:52.225 --> 14:53.966
it is important to know
all the players?

14:56.229 --> 14:57.560
Perhaps.

15:00.650 --> 15:05.395
But the fact that you treat him
as my equal says much about you.

15:05.530 --> 15:08.693
To be honest,
I'm not sure I can trust you.

15:10.660 --> 15:14.153
| appreciate your forwardness

15:14.288 --> 15:17.155
and can only hope that some day soon,
we can remedy that.

15:17.291 --> 15:19.828
-Thank you for the tea.
-Yes.

15:26.509 --> 15:27.920
| repeat: the President's position

15:28.052 --> 15:30.134
on private-school vouchers
is under review.

15:30.263 --> 15:31.674
Come on, Lyor. He's flip-flopping.

15:31.806 --> 15:33.092
Let's not talk about flip-flopping, Nate.

15:33.224 --> 15:35.431
You've had four jobs
in the past three years.

15:35.560 --> 15:37.096
[light laughter, murmuring]

15:37.228 --> 15:40.812
What I mean is, the President is
reviewing the latest data

15:40.940 --> 15:43.648
and will re-articulate
his position shortly, okay?

15:43.776 --> 15:45.153
-[all clamoring]
-Brian?

15:45.278 --> 15:47.360
Can you give us a White House reaction
to the new job report?

15:47.488 --> 15:48.819
Seems a little weaker than expected.

15:48.948 --> 15:51.906
Oh, then you obviously don't know
how to read a jobs report.

15:52.034 --> 15:54.526
Uh, there are these things, Brian...
They're called "numbers”...

15:54.662 --> 15:55.652
[light laughter]

15:55.788 --> 15:57.529
Okay.

15:57.665 --> 15:59.827
The economy is still growing
and inflation remains weak,

15:59.959 --> 16:03.168
So, yes, we are confident
the employment dip is an aberration.

16:03.296 --> 16:05.253
[clamoring resumes]

16:05.381 --> 16:08.043
-Pretty good job in there.
-Well, thank you, Tiffany.

16:08.176 --> 16:10.213
Your approval means
absolutely nothing to me.

16:10.344 --> 16:12.381
You're not still mad about
my last byline, are you?

16:12.513 --> 16:14.424
You mean the one
where you spent 3,000 words

16:14.557 --> 16:17.219
comparing the President's mother-in-law
getting her dying husband a heart

16:17.351 --> 16:19.763
-to a crime against humanity?
-Not in those words, but yeah.

16:19.896 --> 16:22.183
-[chuckles]
-Why are you filling in for Seth again?

16:22.315 --> 16:24.397
-Because he's indisposed.
-What about the President?

16:24.525 --> 16:27.233
-Indisposed.
-I'll bet you don't know the last time

16:27.361 --> 16:29.022
the President didn't have
at least one appearance.

16:29.155 --> 16:30.236
But I do.

16:30.364 --> 16:31.695
Never.

16:32.366 --> 16:34.494
-Is there a question in there?
-More of an observation.

16:34.619 --> 16:36.280
Seth, the President...

16:36.412 --> 16:38.073
Indisposition seems
to be going around.

16:38.206 --> 16:39.617
| have no inclination
to elaborate

16:39.749 --> 16:42.286
on the disposition
of our collective indisposition.

16:42.418 --> 16:43.783
That doesn't even make sense.

16:43.920 --> 16:45.706
Yeah, it does.
It just went over your head.

16:45.838 --> 16:47.920
-[telephone rings in distance]
-[door closes]

16:49.717 --> 16:52.254
20 years of service.
What made you enlist?

16:52.386 --> 16:56.630
Well, I wanted to be a pilot,
but bad eyes put a stop to that.

16:56.766 --> 16:59.758
And Maddy got pregnant,
but I knew I could cook.

16:59.894 --> 17:00.975
Boy can you.

17:01.103 --> 17:02.138
[laughs]

17:02.271 --> 17:04.012
-So, you have kids?
-Yes, sir.

17:04.147 --> 17:08.061
My daughter, Scarlett, just graduated
from Temple, top of her class.

17:08.194 --> 17:09.935
[explosion]

17:10.070 --> 17:11.560
-What the hell was that?
-[shouting in distance]

17:11.696 --> 17:14.859
-Mr. President, we have to go, now!
-[shouting continues]

17:14.992 --> 17:18.030
Assemble at the command tent.
Air Force One, prepare for departure.

17:18.162 --> 17:20.699
[shouting continues]

17:20.830 --> 17:22.538
-Was the base hit?
-No, sir.

17:22.666 --> 17:24.624
Suicide bomber leveled a market
a few miles away.

17:24.752 --> 17:27.084
It was a coordinated attack.
CIIA safe house was also raided.

17:27.213 --> 17:29.625
-American casualties?
-Four of our agents are dead, sir.

17:29.757 --> 17:31.464
-Was Kevin Dean one of them?
-They think he got out.

17:31.592 --> 17:33.048
He was seen leaving
the back of the safe house.

17:33.177 --> 17:34.793
-Any way we can reach him?
-No, sir.

17:34.929 --> 17:37.216
Mr. President, we need to get you
on this plane right now.

17:37.348 --> 17:38.759
-Listen to me--
-I'll listen on the plane, sir.

17:38.891 --> 17:40.552
Please just stop
for one second. Hear me out.

17:40.685 --> 17:43.222
| know you can physically pick me up
and put me on that plane against my will,

17:43.354 --> 17:46.472
and I would have absolutely no recourse.
Hell, they'd probably give you a medal.

17:46.607 --> 17:49.645
But if I leave now, we send a message
to the enemy

17:49.777 --> 17:52.394
that all it takes is one coordinated
attack, and we bolt.

17:53.614 --> 17:54.945
Let's finish this.

17:55.074 --> 17:56.985
[sirens wattling in distance]

17:57.618 --> 17:59.450
Phoenix is not rising.

17:59.579 --> 18:03.038
| repeat, Phoenix is not rising.
Air Force One, stand by.

18:07.628 --> 18:09.130
[Hollister] We received
a distress signal from Dean.

18:09.255 --> 18:11.542
I'm sending in TAC units
to track the beacon on his vehicle.

18:11.674 --> 18:13.085
It's about 50 miles outside of Kabul.

18:13.217 --> 18:15.083
He's not going to be anywhere
near the vehicle, General.

18:15.219 --> 18:16.755
That's where the distress
signal's coming from.

18:16.887 --> 18:20.721
Yes, which means he's either dead
or the insurgents are baiting you.

18:20.850 --> 18:22.761
I'm not sure you're the military
expert here, Agent Wells.

18:22.893 --> 18:25.510
No, sir, I'm not, but I am an expert
on Kevin Dean.

18:25.646 --> 18:27.353
I've worked with him
for four years in Kabul.

18:27.481 --> 18:30.564
| know how he thinks, and there is
no way that he would deliberately

18:30.693 --> 18:32.434
leave that beacon
in a stationary vehicle.

18:32.570 --> 18:35.312
You're welcome to do things your way,
Agent Wells. I'm gonna do them mine.

18:35.448 --> 18:36.938
[sighs]

18:38.159 --> 18:39.615
-Aaron...

18:39.744 --> 18:42.532
If anything hinky jumps off,
you high-tail it back,

18:42.663 --> 18:43.744
-you hear me?
-Understood.

18:43.873 --> 18:46.456
Hey, one more thing. I'm gonna have
to give you a partner.

18:54.133 --> 18:55.840
[engine turns off]

19:00.848 --> 19:02.350
Mike, this is a bad idea.

19:02.475 --> 19:05.058
For who? I spent six years
in Special Forces.

19:05.186 --> 19:07.177
This mission is tactical.
It's not military.

19:07.313 --> 19:10.556
Local knowledge is crucial,
knowledge you don't have.

19:10.691 --> 19:12.147
My job is to protect the President,

19:12.276 --> 19:14.813
and the President's not leaving
the most dangerous place on Earth

19:14.945 --> 19:16.902
until we find the Station Chief.

19:17.031 --> 19:18.396
So I'm gonna find him

19:18.532 --> 19:20.443
and get my boss
the hell out of here.

19:20.576 --> 19:23.489
I'm going with you instead of them
because I think you're right.

19:23.954 --> 19:25.160
Take the compliment.

19:33.214 --> 19:34.375
[woman] The death toll is soaring

19:34.507 --> 19:37.920
after a huge suicide explosion
rocked Kabul just a few hours ago.

19:38.052 --> 19:40.043
From an Afghan official,
we are told that the blast

19:40.179 --> 19:42.671
has taken at least 80 lives.

19:42.807 --> 19:45.139
-Well, one of them's betrayed us already.
-Yes, sir.

19:45.267 --> 19:46.928
Nothing happens in Kabul
without Mullah Bahri

19:47.061 --> 19:48.597
or Mullah Fayad knowing about it.

19:48.729 --> 19:51.141
And both of them have strategic reasons
for doing this.

19:51.273 --> 19:54.641
Bahri can point to the need for a
civilizing influence on a violent culture.

19:54.777 --> 19:56.609
And Fayad can claim
he's still fighting the infidel,

19:56.737 --> 19:59.900
protecting his nation's sovereignty.
His people will rally around that.

20:00.032 --> 20:01.773
We need more intelligence boots
on the ground.

20:01.909 --> 20:04.196
We can redeploy personnel
from Khost or Beirut.

20:04.328 --> 20:06.990
| don't want to do anything
until I talk to both of them again.

20:07.123 --> 20:09.330
-See if you can get them back here.
-Yes, sir.

20:13.796 --> 20:14.706
[chuckles]

20:14.839 --> 20:17.206
Emily, Kendra, this is Julie.

20:17.341 --> 20:20.003
-Hi.
-It's a pleasure to meet both of you.

20:20.136 --> 20:21.797
It's so great to finally see
where Lyor works.

20:21.929 --> 20:25.172
So Julie made partner at Fleming & Hopper
when she was 28.

20:25.307 --> 20:26.172
[sighs] Lyor.

20:26.308 --> 20:28.436
The youngest ad executive
in the firm's history. What?

20:28.561 --> 20:30.643
| got lucky. There was this thing
called "social media."

20:30.771 --> 20:32.637
| was a little ahead
of the curve marketing it.

20:32.773 --> 20:35.014
"Spurt streams your best dreams.”

20:35.151 --> 20:37.233
That's hers, very good.
It's very onomatopoetic.

20:37.361 --> 20:38.317
Boom.

20:38.446 --> 20:40.938
Well, thank you for coming in
on such short notice.

20:41.073 --> 20:42.655
-It's nice to meet you.
-No, I understand.

20:42.783 --> 20:45.024
If Lyor has a problem,
| want to help him fix it.

20:45.161 --> 20:46.026
[Daynes] So this is painless;

20:46.162 --> 20:49.245
| need you both to review
the annulment, sign it.

20:49.373 --> 20:50.829
| have spoken with the IRS,

20:50.958 --> 20:53.074
and they are expecting it
end of the day today.

20:53.210 --> 20:56.453
Is it okay if I get it right back to you?
| have a meeting over at Google.

20:56.589 --> 20:58.455
-Sure.
-I'll walk you out.

20:58.591 --> 21:00.332
-Great meeting you.
-You too.

21:00.468 --> 21:02.425
Lyor dreams of egg creams.

21:02.553 --> 21:05.045
Huh. That's not onomatopoetic,
but it's not bad.

21:06.974 --> 21:08.476
[cellphone rings]

21:08.601 --> 21:09.682
[clears throat]
Mr. President.

21:09.810 --> 21:12.518
Kendra, I know you've been trying
to reach me. I'm sorry. What is it?

21:12.646 --> 21:14.478
Yes, sir. I wanted to update you

21:14.607 --> 21:16.223
on the situation
with the First Lady's subpoena.

21:16.358 --> 21:18.224
| confirmed that the account
in St. Lucia

21:18.360 --> 21:20.192
was opened by Eric Little
during the same time

21:20.321 --> 21:22.483
that your wife and her mother
were vacationing there.

21:22.615 --> 21:25.323
Right, three days before Icarus
landed their government contract.

21:25.451 --> 21:26.941
Yes, sir. The account shows no activity.

21:27.077 --> 21:28.329
It's still flush with $2 million.

21:28.454 --> 21:30.115
Where are we at with
Little's murder investigation?

21:30.247 --> 21:31.863
No developments on that front, sir.

21:31.999 --> 21:34.286
Have you been able to tie
Eric Little to Patrick Lloyd yet?

21:34.418 --> 21:37.080
No, sir. There is no evidence
that connects the two.

21:37.213 --> 21:39.955
Every trap that son of a bitch has laid
for me I've walked straight into.

21:40.090 --> 21:41.592
I'm working every angle I can.

21:41.717 --> 21:43.299
What's important right now
is our strategy,

21:43.427 --> 21:45.293
how the First Lady responds
to the subpoena.

21:45.429 --> 21:47.386
| need to huddle with the two of you
as soon as you get back

21:47.515 --> 21:49.222
and just make sure
you're on the same page, sir.

21:49.350 --> 21:51.933
-I understand. Anything else?
-Kendra.

21:52.061 --> 21:53.768
| have Emily. I think she needs you.

21:53.896 --> 21:55.762
-Can it keep?
-Can it keep?

21:56.440 --> 21:57.726
Yeah.

21:57.858 --> 21:59.565
Yes, sir.

21:59.819 --> 22:00.980
Thank you.

22:01.111 --> 22:03.569
[indistinct chatter]

22:06.075 --> 22:07.065
Hey.

22:08.577 --> 22:09.908
How's your thing?

22:10.538 --> 22:12.449
In process.

22:12.581 --> 22:13.571
How's your thing?

22:13.707 --> 22:15.209
Yeah, in process.

22:15.793 --> 22:16.908
Thanks for covering for me.

22:17.044 --> 22:19.832
Well, the thing about your thing is
it's more serious than my thing.

22:19.964 --> 22:22.797
Otherwise, you'd be helping with my thing
instead of me helping with your thing.

22:22.925 --> 22:24.882
Well, that's the thing.

22:25.010 --> 22:26.546
We help each other out
with our things, right?

22:26.679 --> 22:27.635
Yep.

22:29.974 --> 22:31.840
Do you have any idea what
we're actually talking about?

22:31.976 --> 22:32.966
Nope.

22:34.812 --> 22:37.770
We need to head to the safe house,
see what we can find.

22:37.898 --> 22:38.933
Yeah.

22:39.066 --> 22:40.397
He might've left us a clue.

22:40.526 --> 22:42.688
Mm-hmm.

22:43.696 --> 22:45.687
[indistinct talking in native language]

22:51.328 --> 22:53.535
What is your problem with me, Mike?

22:53.664 --> 22:56.326
The only one with a problem is you -

22:56.458 --> 22:57.835
a problem with the President.

22:57.960 --> 22:58.950
What are you talking about?

22:59.086 --> 23:02.329
It seems like the closer you get to him,
the closer he gets to needing a lawyer.

23:02.464 --> 23:05.456
| figured that you would understand
the importance of following a lead.

23:05.593 --> 23:07.379
-Is that what you figured?
-Look, I work for the White House.

23:07.511 --> 23:10.503
If I don't follow an evidence trail,
it's Watergate. That's the danger.

23:10.639 --> 23:13.506
No, the danger is giving
Patrick Lloyd what he wanted:

23:13.642 --> 23:18.307
a road map to a bogus conspiracy that
drags the White House into the swamp.

23:18.439 --> 23:19.804
Our job is to protect the President.

23:19.940 --> 23:21.476
Well, we have different ways
of doing that.

23:21.609 --> 23:23.816
Yeah. I jump in front of a bullet.

23:23.944 --> 23:26.322
And I stop that bullet from being fired.

23:26.989 --> 23:28.946
[explosion]

23:38.292 --> 23:39.703
[gunfire]

23:42.630 --> 23:44.792
[gunfire continues]

23:49.428 --> 23:52.261
-Have we heard from Mike or Hannah yet?
-No, we can't raise them, sir.

23:52.389 --> 23:54.300
-We think they may have come under fire.
-"We think"?

23:54.433 --> 23:56.174
We're deploying a backup team
as we speak, sir.

23:56.310 --> 23:58.847
Son of a bitch.
What about Bahri and Fayad?

23:58.979 --> 24:02.438
Well, it's just as expected:
condolences, expressions of outrage.

24:02.566 --> 24:05.433
-Crocodile tears.
-Yeah, at least from one of them.

24:05.569 --> 24:07.651
Have they agreed to my request
for a second audience?

24:07.780 --> 24:10.818
[sighs] Yes, sir, but how are you gonna
get the guilty party to tip his hand?

24:10.950 --> 24:12.486
I'm gonna try and get them to discuss

24:12.618 --> 24:14.655
the one thing they like talking
about more than themselves.

24:14.787 --> 24:16.027
-Each other?
-[keypad beeping]

24:16.163 --> 24:17.574
Exactly.

24:20.376 --> 24:22.367
How many hostiles you figure?

24:22.878 --> 24:25.461
A regular interval of shots
suggests a single shooter.

24:26.924 --> 24:28.380
How good's your geometry?

24:28.509 --> 24:29.465
Better than my French.

24:29.593 --> 24:31.800
If I draw him out,
think you can get a fix on him?

24:31.929 --> 24:33.670
-Yeah, but don't do anything--
-I'll do what I do.

24:33.806 --> 24:35.046
-Mike--
-If we jump in this vehicle

24:35.182 --> 24:36.718
and try to drive off,
we're sitting ducks.

24:36.850 --> 24:37.931
Cover me.

24:46.986 --> 24:48.351
He's using the trees for cover.

24:48.487 --> 24:50.228
We got to flush him out.

24:51.115 --> 24:52.446
Are you ready?

24:52.574 --> 24:53.564
Go!

24:57.955 --> 24:58.740
[man grunts]

25:09.633 --> 25:11.920
There's not much left
of the safe house.

25:12.052 --> 25:13.793
We still need to be careful.

25:17.599 --> 25:18.930
[car door closes]

25:23.230 --> 25:25.437
-We should canvass the inside.
-Yeah.

25:29.862 --> 25:31.444
[door creaks]

25:45.002 --> 25:46.083
Mike.

25:52.468 --> 25:54.334
Dean's alive.

25:54.928 --> 25:57.920
And I know where to find him.

26:00.476 --> 26:03.184
[Daynes] This is the dashcam video
of Seth's traffic stop.

26:03.312 --> 26:05.223
Now, it's clear, given
the traffic infraction,

26:05.355 --> 26:07.483
that the officer had reasonable
suspicion for the stop.

26:07.608 --> 26:09.474
[Emily] And that's you tossing
a knapsack in the back seat.

26:09.610 --> 26:11.066
But you can't really make out
what I'm doing.

26:11.195 --> 26:13.527
You can't, but it'll be
your word against a cop's,

26:13.655 --> 26:15.612
and if he says
he saw suspicious movement,

26:15.741 --> 26:18.859
-it's probable cause for a search.
-So do we attack probable cause?

26:18.994 --> 26:21.361
With this video...
we don't have many options.

26:21.497 --> 26:23.784
I'm not testifying, no matter what.

26:23.916 --> 26:26.283
We get this thing kicked, or I'm toast.

26:26.418 --> 26:28.079
What else do you have
in your playbook?

26:28.212 --> 26:29.452
I'll figure something out.

26:30.547 --> 26:32.584
Fayad is an animal.

26:32.716 --> 26:36.129
Many of my followers are dead,
killed at that market attack.

26:36.261 --> 26:37.547
I'm very sorry for your loss.

26:37.679 --> 26:38.840
But Fayad isn't.

26:38.972 --> 26:42.556
The only tradition he wants to continue
is one of bloodshed.

26:42.684 --> 26:44.095
Do you have proof of this?

26:44.228 --> 26:46.060
[scoffs]
Al Amin is reporting

26:46.188 --> 26:48.020
that the explosive
used at the market bombing

26:48.148 --> 26:50.355
-was triacetone triperoxide.
-That's not proof.

26:50.484 --> 26:53.067
Even I know that T-A-T-P is made
from hydrogen peroxide,

26:53.195 --> 26:55.027
which is legal
and readily available.

26:55.155 --> 26:58.318
But not in Kabul.
We have a massive shortage.

26:58.450 --> 27:01.033
But you might be interested
to know who owns a company

27:01.161 --> 27:03.368
in the Waziristan province
of Pakistan

27:03.497 --> 27:05.408
that manufactures that chemical.

27:06.291 --> 27:07.907
Mullah Fayad.

27:08.919 --> 27:10.330
Bahri is a liar!

27:10.462 --> 27:13.204
Not about your country's
shortage of hydrogen peroxide,

27:13.340 --> 27:16.253
or Thamin Chemicals,
a shell company that you own,

27:16.385 --> 27:18.467
which these articles
of incorporation prove.

27:18.595 --> 27:19.756
| own many things.

27:19.888 --> 27:21.299
Except this thing

27:21.431 --> 27:23.297
is used to manufacture
the raw materials

27:23.433 --> 27:25.219
to make bombs that are killing
American soldiers.

27:25.352 --> 27:29.471
We manufacture this chemical
for medical purposes.

27:29.606 --> 27:32.223
| did not kidnap Mr. Dean.

27:32.359 --> 27:34.726
| did not bomb the market.

27:35.779 --> 27:37.770
If you are lying to me...

27:38.574 --> 27:40.565
...I promise you,
we will hunt you down.

27:44.329 --> 27:46.286
We all die, Mr. President.

27:47.499 --> 27:50.491
But I didn't meet with you
to talk about death.

27:51.503 --> 27:54.461
| met with you to talk about life.

27:54.590 --> 27:56.422
But if you call me a liar...

27:57.259 --> 27:58.749
then I have an enemy,

27:59.344 --> 28:01.506
the same enemy I have always had.

28:18.238 --> 28:19.228
[knock on door]

28:23.243 --> 28:24.404
-Michael?
-Yes. Hi.

28:24.536 --> 28:26.698
Hi. Thank you so much
for coming in.

28:26.830 --> 28:27.911
-Sure.
-Please.

28:28.040 --> 28:29.781
But I already gave Ms. Daynes
my statement.

28:29.917 --> 28:32.454
| know, and it matched
your brother's perfectly.

28:32.586 --> 28:34.168
| just had some follow-up.

28:34.296 --> 28:36.958
| know Seth well, really well,
which is why I was surprised

28:37.090 --> 28:39.127
to hear that he's been
wolfing modafinil.

28:39.259 --> 28:41.967
Seth's a perfectionist, always wants
to stay ahead of the curve.

28:42.095 --> 28:44.678
Runs in the family.
| hear you just crushed the MCATSs.

28:44.806 --> 28:47.298
[chuckles]
Yeah, I did okay.

28:47.434 --> 28:49.425
Must have been a lot of late nights.

28:51.230 --> 28:53.187
It was brutal.

28:53.315 --> 28:55.226
My cousin just crammed
for that beast,

28:55.359 --> 28:58.647
16-hour days for months.
You know what got her through it?

28:59.821 --> 29:02.859
Modafinil, handfuls of the stuff.

29:03.867 --> 29:05.699
Seth was adamant
that he wouldn't testify,

29:05.827 --> 29:07.283
and I think I know why.

29:07.412 --> 29:10.074
Because to defend himself,
he'd have to commit perjury.

29:12.501 --> 29:14.162
He's covering for you, isn't he?

29:14.294 --> 29:15.876
[sighs]

29:16.463 --> 29:19.171
| didn't want him to, but he told me
to keep my mouth shut,

29:19.299 --> 29:21.586
said I could never get into med school
with a drug conviction.

29:21.718 --> 29:25.086
And he was right. But that
doesn't mean you're not wrong.

29:25.222 --> 29:26.838
[sighs]

29:27.891 --> 29:29.052
I'll call Ms. Daynes.

29:29.184 --> 29:30.800
There's no point.

29:30.936 --> 29:32.973
He's just gonna say that you're lying
because that's...

29:33.105 --> 29:34.220
[inhales deeply]

29:34.356 --> 29:36.768
...who he is, loyal to a fault.

29:38.277 --> 29:40.359
[sighs]

29:40.487 --> 29:41.943
I'm so sorry.

29:42.990 --> 29:45.072
| am, too.

29:45.200 --> 29:48.318
Your big brother made a decision
to protect you, Michael.

29:48.453 --> 29:50.160
The problem is...

29:50.289 --> 29:52.326
no one may be able
to protect him.

29:55.460 --> 29:57.952
[Daynes] Officer Rudy, did you
run my client's license plate

29:58.088 --> 29:59.920
before approaching his car?

30:00.048 --> 30:02.915
-Yes. It's standard procedure.
-Did you find any priors?

30:03.051 --> 30:04.132
No.

30:04.261 --> 30:07.049
Your report here indicates that
my client made a "furtive gesture.”

30:07.180 --> 30:09.171
Could you please describe it?

30:09.308 --> 30:11.219
| saw the defendant
reach between the seats

30:11.351 --> 30:13.683
-as I approached the vehicle.
-Could you be more specific?

30:13.812 --> 30:15.394
No. It was dark.

30:15.522 --> 30:17.229
| thought he might be
reaching for a gun.

30:17.357 --> 30:19.223
Or tying his shoe, right?

30:19.359 --> 30:21.942
Objection. The fact that
Officer Rudy didn't know exactly

30:22.070 --> 30:24.061
what Mr. Wright was doing
doesn't undercut probable cause.

30:24.197 --> 30:26.529
-It supports it.
-Sustained. Move on, Ms. Daynes.

30:26.658 --> 30:29.525
Officer, are you familiar
with departmental quotas?

30:29.661 --> 30:31.698
Objection. Relevance.

30:31.830 --> 30:33.662
-Goes to pretext.
-I'll allow it.

30:35.250 --> 30:36.411
We don't have formal quotas.

30:36.543 --> 30:38.625
Officer, how many arrests
did you make in September?

30:38.962 --> 30:40.077
43.

30:40.213 --> 30:41.624
How many arrests in October?

30:41.757 --> 30:43.839
47,
-How many in November?

30:45.802 --> 30:47.418
Officer.

30:47.554 --> 30:48.760
12.

30:48.889 --> 30:52.427
Did you apply unsuccessfully
to the Detective division

30:52.559 --> 30:54.425
in each of the last three years?

30:54.561 --> 30:56.097
Is there a point here, Judge?

30:56.229 --> 30:58.687
Yes, and Officer Rudy has made it.

30:58.815 --> 31:02.058
A "furtive gesture" made
by a man with no criminal record

31:02.194 --> 31:05.186
leads to a search by a beat cop
who's been bucking for a promotion

31:05.322 --> 31:07.313
and has had a decidedly
subpar month.

31:07.449 --> 31:09.360
-Objection. Counsel's testifying.
-[Judge Schroeder] Ms. Daynes--

31:09.493 --> 31:11.279
One last question, Your Honor.

31:11.411 --> 31:13.948
Officer, of the 26 vehicle searches

31:14.081 --> 31:16.288
you made this year
that resulted in arrests,

31:16.416 --> 31:18.453
how many of them were suppressed
as illegal searches?

31:18.585 --> 31:19.996
Judge, really?

31:22.381 --> 31:24.122
I'd like to hear it.

31:27.677 --> 31:29.054
14.

31:29.179 --> 31:32.262
-Judge, that's not material.
- I disagree.

31:32.391 --> 31:36.055
The People have to carry the burden
of showing probable cause.

31:36.186 --> 31:38.302
Given the circumstances,

31:38.438 --> 31:40.429
I'm not convinced
that burden has been met.

31:40.565 --> 31:42.272
The indictment is dismissed.

31:42.401 --> 31:43.937
[gavel bangs]

31:49.699 --> 31:51.610
The molar mass of water?

31:51.743 --> 31:53.120
18.02.

31:53.245 --> 31:55.407
When Kevin and I worked together,
it was our rendezvous clue.

31:55.539 --> 31:59.077
Nearest body of water - smart.

32:09.344 --> 32:11.051
-Kevin?
-[gun cocks]

32:11.179 --> 32:13.011
[exhales sharply]
Thank God.

32:13.140 --> 32:15.131
[groans] I'm fine.

32:15.267 --> 32:17.929
| got a confederate a half click away
who can get us to safety.

32:18.562 --> 32:21.304
[grunting] Okay, okay.
[breathing heavily]

32:24.067 --> 32:26.149
[man] This, obviously,
was a targeted bombing.

32:26.278 --> 32:28.440
-[knock on door]
-We missed you today, Seth.

32:28.572 --> 32:30.813
-[door closes]
-Oh, thanks. Yeah.

32:30.949 --> 32:34.112
I'll be back tomorrow,
bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.

32:34.244 --> 32:36.576
Congrats on beating your drug rap.

32:36.705 --> 32:37.991
[scoffs]

32:38.123 --> 32:40.034
Look, Lyor's good at many things,

32:40.167 --> 32:43.376
but being Press Secretary
isn't one of them.

32:43.503 --> 32:44.743
And if the White House deployed him,

32:44.880 --> 32:46.871
it had to be because you had
some kind of an emergency.

32:47.007 --> 32:48.122
-Tiffany--
-White House emergencies

32:48.258 --> 32:49.794
tend to be legal or medical,

32:49.926 --> 32:53.260
so I had my sources at the hospitals
and the courthouses on high alert.

32:55.682 --> 32:56.968
What do you want?

32:57.851 --> 32:59.637
Nothing regarding
your modafinil adventure.

32:59.769 --> 33:02.022
The case was dismissed.
It's a non-story.

33:02.147 --> 33:06.357
But I was pursuing another story
before your situation sidetracked me.

33:06.485 --> 33:08.271
Where is the President, Seth?

33:08.862 --> 33:11.194
The President's daily schedule
clearly says that he's--

33:11.323 --> 33:12.905
[chuckling]
That he's in the Oval?

33:13.033 --> 33:14.694
Then where's Mike Ritter?

33:15.494 --> 33:17.235
Because if the President was in the Oval,

33:17.370 --> 33:19.498
| would see Mike Ritter day and night,

33:19.623 --> 33:22.581
not that stooge that you've stationed
over there to throw us off the scent.

33:23.752 --> 33:25.709
Give me 24 hours.
I'll give you an exclusive.

33:25.837 --> 33:27.669
Deal.

33:30.884 --> 33:32.625
[sighs]

33:35.138 --> 33:36.344
Mr. President.

33:38.350 --> 33:40.216
Hannah and Mike are on their way.
Dean's with them.

33:40.352 --> 33:42.514
-Thank God. How far out are they?
-About 10 minutes.

33:42.646 --> 33:44.512
Did Dean forward any intel
on the attackers?

33:44.648 --> 33:46.980
Yeah, he heard them speaking Urdu
as he was fleeing.

33:47.108 --> 33:48.610
That means they're most likely Pakistani.

33:48.735 --> 33:51.193
Dean's conversational in Urdu.
He's not fluent.

33:51.321 --> 33:53.358
We've transcribed his notes
about what he overheard.

33:53.490 --> 33:54.651
Let me see.

33:59.371 --> 34:01.863
[exhales sharply]
Well, now we know who to trust.

34:01.998 --> 34:03.784
Contact Mullah Bahri.
Tell him he was right.

34:03.917 --> 34:06.158
| want to shore up our partnership.

34:07.379 --> 34:09.791
[Kirkman] We now know that
the attackers were Pakistani.

34:09.922 --> 34:12.335
| knew it. Fayad is a snake.

34:12.467 --> 34:14.458
And not a very clever one.

34:14.594 --> 34:16.505
The T-A-T-P trail
led straight to him.

34:17.514 --> 34:20.176
Well, Fayad is a simple but brutal man.

34:20.308 --> 34:21.469
So you said.

34:22.936 --> 34:25.348
But he was not responsible
for today's attack.

34:25.480 --> 34:27.938
We have drone footage
of your compound from yesterday.

34:28.065 --> 34:31.103
Four cars, all
with Pakistani license plates.

34:31.235 --> 34:33.022
| have many Pakistani followers.

34:33.154 --> 34:34.565
And we know what they were following.

34:34.697 --> 34:36.860
Our CIA Station Chief overheard
the attackers talking.

34:36.992 --> 34:40.485
They kept referring to "the child."
"We need to do this for the little one.”

34:40.620 --> 34:43.282
You gave me a very loose
translation for Zowan.

34:43.415 --> 34:45.156
Gentlemen, please come in.

34:45.292 --> 34:47.875
We killed one of the attackers
and retrieved his cellphone.

34:48.003 --> 34:49.458
Your number was in it.

34:49.588 --> 34:51.204
Your name, your number;
you planned the attack.

34:51.339 --> 34:53.501
-Mr. President--
-You killed Americans!

34:53.632 --> 34:55.089
And for that you will pay.

34:55.217 --> 34:57.255
You will never see
your precious sunlight again.

35:07.522 --> 35:09.433
You come to our country...

35:10.317 --> 35:12.024
desecrate it...

35:12.736 --> 35:15.649
and you expect to be welcomed
like heroes?

35:17.073 --> 35:18.905
You are invaders.

35:20.243 --> 35:22.405
And invaders deserve death.

35:22.537 --> 35:24.824
This is the part you always get wrong.

35:24.956 --> 35:27.197
You provided sanctuary
and assistance

35:27.334 --> 35:29.371
to the people who attacked my country:

35:29.502 --> 35:31.880
September 11, 2001.

35:35.508 --> 35:37.010
Take him into custody.

35:50.607 --> 35:51.847
-Hi.
-Hi.

35:51.983 --> 35:54.224
-Thanks for taking the time, Emily.
-Of course.

35:54.361 --> 35:55.851
So...

35:56.655 --> 35:57.565
what is the problem?

35:57.697 --> 36:00.735
| wanted to see if there was a way
that I didn't have to sign this?

36:00.867 --> 36:01.982
I'm sorry?

36:02.118 --> 36:06.282
What I'm saying is,
I'm fine with the status quo.

36:07.874 --> 36:10.081
-Can I speak freely, Julie?
-Please.

36:10.210 --> 36:11.792
Are you out of your mind?

36:11.920 --> 36:13.456
How can I explain this?

36:15.507 --> 36:17.589
Lyor and I took a trip to Paris
together once,

36:17.717 --> 36:19.708
and we were standing
on the Pont Neuf,

36:19.844 --> 36:21.460
holding hands, and I said,

36:21.596 --> 36:22.882
"There's no place I'd rather be."”

36:23.014 --> 36:26.882
And Lyor looked at this yacht and said,
"| think I'd rather be on that boat."

36:27.018 --> 36:28.429
-That's horrible.
-[chuckles]

36:28.561 --> 36:31.098
No, you don't get it.
He wasn't being mean or ironic.

36:31.231 --> 36:34.394
-He was being literal.
-The boat was nicer than the bridge.

36:34.526 --> 36:38.941
There's no artifice to him.
He's honest and decent and loyal.

36:39.072 --> 36:43.361
And you are beautiful
and successful and normal.

36:44.411 --> 36:46.903
I've dated so many normal guys,

36:47.038 --> 36:49.200
none of them worth a damn.

36:49.332 --> 36:51.824
If I needed help,
if my life was on the line,

36:51.960 --> 36:54.076
Lyor is the only person I would call,

36:54.212 --> 36:55.543
and he would come running.

36:56.923 --> 36:58.425
And I want... I need...

36:58.550 --> 37:00.336
To keep that connection.

37:02.846 --> 37:04.507
| know it sounds pathetic, right?

37:04.639 --> 37:05.800
No.

37:05.932 --> 37:08.264
It sounds like love,
but here's the thing.

37:08.393 --> 37:10.384
Maybe there's a way for you
to keep that connection

37:10.520 --> 37:12.932
without costing him a fortune.

37:16.443 --> 37:18.309
Hey, Matthew, I'm gonna give you
Drucilla's shield.

37:18.445 --> 37:20.356
You just need it more than I do
right now.

37:20.488 --> 37:22.479
-Open your inventory.
-Lyor.

37:23.742 --> 37:25.733
[speaking Italian]

37:28.496 --> 37:29.998
| need to get the annulment from you.

37:30.123 --> 37:32.740
[speaking German]

37:32.876 --> 37:34.332
Did you get it yet, Matthew?

37:34.461 --> 37:37.044
Equip. Let's go.

37:39.340 --> 37:41.752
Um, let's flank him from the right.

37:45.138 --> 37:47.926
[speaking Italian]

37:48.057 --> 37:50.469
[speaking Mandarin]

37:53.313 --> 37:54.974
Uh...

37:55.106 --> 37:57.188
Hey, Ming. Ming.

37:57.317 --> 37:58.478
Ming?

37:58.610 --> 37:59.941
Ah, Ming.

38:01.404 --> 38:02.690
Hey.

38:02.822 --> 38:04.813
Hey. Snowed in over here.

38:05.408 --> 38:07.524
Yeah, I...

38:07.660 --> 38:09.276
| just wanted to say
I'm sorry again.

38:09.412 --> 38:10.823
Okay.

38:11.623 --> 38:14.411
Come on, Em.
You got to let me up.

38:14.542 --> 38:16.408
| was protecting my family.

38:17.796 --> 38:19.662
We're your family, too.

38:19.798 --> 38:22.335
Did you think about
how your choice would affect us?

38:22.467 --> 38:25.334
My brother's career
was about to go up in smoke.

38:25.470 --> 38:27.711
And yours could've, too.
It still might.

38:27.847 --> 38:29.178
The charges were dismissed.

38:29.307 --> 38:31.469
But my duty to inform
the President wasn't.

38:31.601 --> 38:33.308
This isn't a local five-and-dime.

38:33.436 --> 38:36.349
-There is a higher standard around here.
-Do you really think I don't know that?

38:36.481 --> 38:39.189
- I think you expect special treatment.
-From whom?

38:39.317 --> 38:40.728
| called Kendra, I didn't call you.

38:40.860 --> 38:42.237
You know the buck stops with me.

38:43.571 --> 38:45.187
And we're...

38:47.075 --> 38:49.157
[sighs]

38:49.285 --> 38:52.368
What am I supposed to do
when this lands on my desk?

38:52.497 --> 38:55.956
The right thing.
What you always do.

38:59.379 --> 39:00.710
[sighs]

39:03.842 --> 39:05.424
Chief Dean is under medical care, sir.

39:05.552 --> 39:07.668
-He's gonna be fine.
-Thank God. That's great news.

39:07.804 --> 39:10.136
And the safe house is being moved
to an undisclosed location.

39:10.265 --> 39:13.508
-Our men will be safe, sir.
-You two make a great team.

39:13.643 --> 39:15.133
We're just doing our job, sir.

39:15.270 --> 39:17.102
-Wheels up in five, Mr. President.
-Thank you.

39:17.230 --> 39:20.018
There's one last thing I need
to do before we take off.

39:20.149 --> 39:22.982
[indistinct chatter,
helicopter blades whirring]

39:23.111 --> 39:25.022
| made this for you, sir.

39:25.905 --> 39:28.283
A little taste of home, cheesecake.

39:28.408 --> 39:30.866
The recipe's from Morty's on West 76th.

39:30.994 --> 39:32.701
That's two blocks
from where I grew up.

39:32.829 --> 39:34.695
- Googled you.
-[both laugh]

39:36.040 --> 39:37.747
Thank you.

39:37.876 --> 39:39.708
You're welcome. Enjoy.

39:42.088 --> 39:43.123
Harry.

39:44.799 --> 39:46.710
Why the hell aren't you home yet?

39:47.760 --> 39:49.467
Sir?

39:50.680 --> 39:53.138
Well, you told me you enlisted
right before your daughter was born,

39:53.266 --> 39:55.507
said you wanted to get your 20 years.

39:56.519 --> 39:59.307
And then, you said your daughter
graduated from college.

39:59.772 --> 40:02.901
And that's at least 22 years,
so why the hell aren't you home yet?

40:06.696 --> 40:09.529
My wife, Maddy,
died three years ago, sir.

40:10.742 --> 40:12.983
-I'm very sorry.
-Lung cancer.

40:14.120 --> 40:16.327
She was supposed to have two years...

40:17.248 --> 40:18.750
turned out to be two months.

40:20.501 --> 40:22.242
And I wasn't there.

40:24.130 --> 40:25.541
And my daughter...

40:26.299 --> 40:28.085
she never forgave me.

40:28.217 --> 40:30.549
When was the last time
you talked to her?

40:32.138 --> 40:33.754
A year.

40:34.307 --> 40:35.968
And it didn't go very well.

40:38.561 --> 40:40.222
You see, sir, I...
[chuckles]

40:40.355 --> 40:42.938
| don't have a home
to go to anymore.

40:43.066 --> 40:45.228
You can always go home.

40:45.360 --> 40:47.476
Doesn't mean it's gonna be easy,

40:47.612 --> 40:51.776
regardless of whatever's happened
or how many miles away you are.

40:53.159 --> 40:55.776
Truth is, all you have to do is knock.

40:55.912 --> 40:57.323
[sighs]

40:57.664 --> 40:59.120
Yes, sir.

40:59.248 --> 41:02.161
I'm gonna recommend to your C.O.
that you get some leave.

41:04.045 --> 41:06.286
When that comes,
| suggest you take it,

41:07.340 --> 41:09.126
go to Philadelphia.

41:11.010 --> 41:12.421
Well...

41:13.012 --> 41:14.798
you'll know what to do then.

41:15.682 --> 41:17.593
I'm gonna knock.

41:20.937 --> 41:22.894
It's been an honor, Harry.

41:32.490 --> 41:33.855
Sir? What is it?

41:34.826 --> 41:36.737
I'm gonna need
the contact information

41:36.869 --> 41:39.452
for the families
of the four men we lost today.

41:41.082 --> 41:42.823
Yes, sir.

41:42.959 --> 41:44.950
[door closes]
