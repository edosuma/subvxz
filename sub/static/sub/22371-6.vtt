WEBVTT

00:26.860 --> 00:28.851
(gate rattles, creaking)

01:44.271 --> 01:45.761
<i>Rick: The plan is working.</i>

01:45.856 --> 01:47.813
<i>We're doing this.</i>

01:47.899 --> 01:49.606
<i>We're winning.</i>

01:54.406 --> 01:56.317
<i>We had a hard fight.</i>

01:56.408 --> 01:59.776
<i>We lost people,
brave people who gave their lives</i>

01:59.870 --> 02:01.406
<i>to make sure we won.</i>

02:06.543 --> 02:09.877
<i>By the time it was over,</i>

02:09.963 --> 02:13.456
<i>there weren't any Saviors left standing.</i>

02:14.926 --> 02:16.508
Maggie: We beat 'em,

02:16.595 --> 02:19.087
<i>but things got complicated.</i>

02:19.181 --> 02:21.297
<i>Jesus took prisoners,</i>

02:21.391 --> 02:23.553
<i>brought 'em back home.</i>

02:23.644 --> 02:26.636
<i>We're holding 'em
outside our gates for now,</i>

02:26.730 --> 02:28.846
<i>till we decide what to do.</i>

02:30.067 --> 02:32.024
<i>Until I decide.</i>

02:36.782 --> 02:39.774
<i>Carol: We took the outpost bit by bit.</i>

02:39.868 --> 02:41.779
<i>We thought we'd won.</i>

02:41.870 --> 02:44.362
<i>We were gathered up in the open
when they ambushed us.</i>

02:44.456 --> 02:46.242
<i>It was over in seconds.</i>

02:46.333 --> 02:49.325
<i>Ezekiel, Jerry, and me,</i>

02:49.419 --> 02:51.626
<i>we're the only ones who made it back.</i>

02:54.591 --> 02:56.207
<i>Rick: All of it,</i>

02:56.301 --> 02:58.087
<i>it's scarier than I thought it'd be,</i>

02:58.178 --> 02:59.384
<i>but we're doing it.</i>

02:59.471 --> 03:01.053
<i>We have to.</i>

03:01.139 --> 03:03.221
<i>Sasha was first,</i>

03:03.308 --> 03:06.016
and now there's been more.

03:06.103 --> 03:08.515
<i>The sacrifices are real.</i>

03:08.605 --> 03:12.269
<i>We need to make it right for them.</i>

03:12.359 --> 03:15.021
<i>The rest of the plan's still a go.</i>

03:15.112 --> 03:17.319
<i>We're moving on to the next step.</i>

03:17.406 --> 03:19.647
<i>I'm headed there now.</i>

03:19.741 --> 03:21.857
<i>The Sanctuary's still surrounded.</i>

03:21.952 --> 03:25.286
<i>They're trapped,
cut off from their supplies.</i>

03:25.372 --> 03:28.535
<i>Every hour that goes by,
we're makin' 'em weaker.</i>

03:28.625 --> 03:32.084
<i>The lookouts are all around the compound.</i>

03:32.170 --> 03:35.538
<i>They open a door, we fire.</i>

03:35.632 --> 03:37.543
<i>But if they open a door,</i>

03:37.634 --> 03:40.717
<i>seems like they'd have bigger problems.</i>

03:40.804 --> 03:45.389
<i>We meet at Sanctuary
in two days to end this,</i>

03:45.475 --> 03:46.715
<i>to win it all.</i>

03:48.395 --> 03:51.228
<i>It's not like
we haven't fought before.</i>

03:51.314 --> 03:54.397
<i>We fought every step of the way
to this place,</i>

03:54.484 --> 03:56.395
<i>to this moment.</i>

03:56.486 --> 03:59.319
<i>The path has led us here,</i>

03:59.406 --> 04:02.774
<i>to who we are, to each other,</i>

04:02.868 --> 04:05.030
<i>to now.</i>

04:05.120 --> 04:06.861
And we're so close.

04:10.876 --> 04:14.039
<i>This can be our last fight.</i>

04:20.135 --> 04:22.467
(knocking on door)

04:31.938 --> 04:34.305
(banging, creaking)

04:43.742 --> 04:45.358
(theme music playing)

05:28.912 --> 05:30.994
Jesus:Food.

05:42.133 --> 05:44.374
Yeah, keep it.

05:47.639 --> 05:50.051
(door opens)

05:53.562 --> 05:55.223
Jesus.

05:58.942 --> 06:00.148
Jesus...

06:01.736 --> 06:03.147
Hi.

06:04.447 --> 06:06.029
You're giving away our food.

06:06.116 --> 06:08.528
We had a bumper crop of turnips
in the root cellar.

06:08.618 --> 06:10.074
We couldn't get rid of them.

06:10.161 --> 06:11.868
Saviors left them behind
after they raided us.

06:11.955 --> 06:15.243
That cellar is there for a reason.

06:15.333 --> 06:17.540
We might have plenty now,
but that could change.

06:17.627 --> 06:18.913
We got to look after our own.

06:19.004 --> 06:22.122
Gregory: Paul, this is a farce.
It's gone on long enough.

06:22.215 --> 06:24.798
I mean, build a gallows already.

06:24.885 --> 06:26.250
You're handy, Margaret.

06:26.344 --> 06:28.927
Save the bullets and be done with it.

06:29.014 --> 06:30.550
- Maggie: Gregory...
- What?

06:30.640 --> 06:33.348
I'm just saying what everybody
inside there is thinking.

06:33.435 --> 06:35.267
Maggie: Go inside.

06:36.563 --> 06:38.270
Now.

06:39.399 --> 06:40.810
Come on, Gregory.

06:40.901 --> 06:42.938
(scoffs)

06:43.028 --> 06:44.644
You know I'm right.

06:55.332 --> 06:57.494
Maggie: You shouldn't have
put us in this position.

06:59.002 --> 07:00.959
Are you seriously thinking about
doing what Gregory said?

07:01.046 --> 07:03.037
Every option's on the table.

07:03.131 --> 07:04.292
They have to be.

07:04.382 --> 07:06.840
What are we fighting for, Maggie?

07:08.219 --> 07:09.254
You know.

07:09.346 --> 07:10.632
Yeah, I thought I did.

07:10.722 --> 07:12.087
That's why they're here.

07:13.558 --> 07:15.344
We have to end this

07:15.435 --> 07:17.927
- and Negan.
- We will.

07:18.021 --> 07:19.261
But when we do,

07:19.356 --> 07:22.690
we have to make sure what's left
is worth what we lost.

07:39.751 --> 07:41.833
The King is not receiving visitors.

07:45.090 --> 07:46.546
Ezekiel!

07:48.218 --> 07:49.834
We promised to meet
Rick and the others.

07:49.928 --> 07:52.135
You need to get out here.

07:53.473 --> 07:56.556
We have to gather
everyone who can fight.

07:58.687 --> 08:00.269
(knock on door)

08:00.355 --> 08:02.312
He told me to go, you know.

08:03.733 --> 08:05.690
That I didn't need to do this anymore.

08:08.655 --> 08:11.363
This is what I do.

08:16.997 --> 08:18.988
I'll go with you.

08:19.082 --> 08:21.073
- I'll fight.
- No.

08:21.167 --> 08:22.703
And don't follow me.

08:54.284 --> 08:56.275
Jadis: Alone?

08:56.369 --> 08:57.951
I am.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.122
I shot you.

09:02.208 --> 09:03.619
Grazed me.

09:05.128 --> 09:07.210
Why back after?

09:09.090 --> 09:11.548
For the same thing I wanted before.

09:12.719 --> 09:14.426
A deal.

09:16.347 --> 09:17.553
Trust you?

09:17.640 --> 09:19.802
Shot you.

09:19.893 --> 09:22.260
You grazed me.

09:22.353 --> 09:24.640
Iwoulda still been mad
if you'd shot me.

09:25.815 --> 09:27.977
We kill your people.

09:28.068 --> 09:30.730
We killed some of yours, too.

09:30.820 --> 09:33.733
But we need you, and you need us.

09:33.823 --> 09:35.564
Trick.

09:35.658 --> 09:37.399
Rick: It's not.

09:37.494 --> 09:40.111
I coulda come with my people,

09:40.205 --> 09:41.787
taken this place.

09:41.873 --> 09:43.739
You know I have the numbers
for that now.

09:43.833 --> 09:44.948
You saw it.

09:45.043 --> 09:46.283
Jadis: Still?

09:47.337 --> 09:48.919
Alone, you.

09:50.256 --> 09:52.918
Need us to save you.

09:55.053 --> 09:57.169
Not anymore.

09:58.765 --> 10:01.507
The Saviors are finished.

10:02.685 --> 10:04.926
We took down their outposts.

10:06.356 --> 10:09.223
Negan and his people
are trapped by walkers,

10:09.317 --> 10:10.603
hundreds of them.

10:10.693 --> 10:13.185
Until they surrender...

10:13.279 --> 10:15.190
or we end them.

10:15.281 --> 10:17.272
That's their choice.

10:17.367 --> 10:19.404
Now I'm giving one to you.

10:20.954 --> 10:23.446
Look, I get it-- you take, don't bother.

10:24.582 --> 10:26.038
So you took Negan's deal.

10:26.126 --> 10:28.117
I'm here to offer a better one.

10:28.211 --> 10:30.669
My people will win.

10:30.755 --> 10:34.544
Your choice is to forget Negan,

10:34.634 --> 10:37.467
switch sides again.

10:37.554 --> 10:39.170
And be a part of the next world

10:39.264 --> 10:41.471
that Alexandria, the Hilltop,
and the Kingdom

10:41.558 --> 10:44.141
will build together.

10:44.227 --> 10:46.844
Or...

10:46.938 --> 10:49.020
we destroy you.

10:50.567 --> 10:53.309
Brion: Threats and dreams.

10:54.404 --> 10:57.487
Dreams and threats.

11:00.618 --> 11:03.235
Now, my people know I'm here.

11:03.329 --> 11:06.492
And what they do next
depends on what you do right now.

11:09.085 --> 11:10.871
Yes or no?

11:10.962 --> 11:12.919
What's it gonna be?

11:18.595 --> 11:19.676
No.

11:30.190 --> 11:32.602
Talks too much.

11:42.452 --> 11:44.739
Gregory:
People who aren't leaders

11:44.829 --> 11:46.411
always think they know better.

11:46.497 --> 11:47.703
Hmm?

11:47.790 --> 11:51.579
Always... pointing the finger at the guy,

11:51.669 --> 11:53.251
or, yes, sure,

11:53.338 --> 11:56.376
gal who's sitting in the hot seat.

11:56.466 --> 11:58.878
Truth is, it's not so easy.

11:58.968 --> 12:00.675
I don't know.

12:02.138 --> 12:05.301
It was pretty easy for me
not to sell out the Hilltop to Negan.

12:05.391 --> 12:07.598
Go ahead--judge me, Margaret.

12:08.728 --> 12:11.470
What I did was in the best interest
of this community.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.430
HOW?

12:13.524 --> 12:16.107
My approach didn't employ bullets.

12:16.194 --> 12:18.356
Connect the dots.

12:20.657 --> 12:22.694
You were scared.

12:22.784 --> 12:25.276
You tried to cut a deal
to save your own hide.

12:25.370 --> 12:26.735
Not just my hide.

12:26.829 --> 12:29.070
My motives were pure.

12:29.165 --> 12:32.248
I know, Maggie, we--
we've had our differences.

12:32.335 --> 12:34.292
But I've sat in that chair.

12:34.379 --> 12:36.871
I can help.

12:36.965 --> 12:38.330
I'm already in the room.

12:38.424 --> 12:40.882
So I can keep an eye on you
while I think.

12:40.969 --> 12:43.085
Keep an eye on me? Come on.

12:43.179 --> 12:46.092
You need someone to tell you
it's okay to follow your gut.

12:46.182 --> 12:47.718
And guess what?

12:47.809 --> 12:49.891
I'm that guy.

12:49.978 --> 12:54.222
Our hippie-dippie kung-fu-fightin' friend

12:54.315 --> 12:57.979
may try and make you feel bad about it,

12:58.069 --> 12:59.559
but at the end of the day,

12:59.654 --> 13:01.770
you're the shepherd.

13:01.864 --> 13:03.195
And you can't have wolves

13:03.283 --> 13:05.524
wandering around amongst the sheep.

13:08.121 --> 13:10.032
It's as simple as that.

13:21.217 --> 13:23.003
Rick said stay put.

13:23.094 --> 13:25.051
Just gonna look.

13:27.598 --> 13:29.555
- You're still healing.
- (sighs)

13:29.642 --> 13:31.428
Get some rest.
Get ready for the next fight.

13:31.519 --> 13:33.601
I'll be back soon.

13:34.897 --> 13:36.888
(engine starts)

13:40.445 --> 13:42.356
(sighs)

13:44.115 --> 13:45.731
You're still healing.

13:46.909 --> 13:49.321
You were shot.

13:49.412 --> 13:51.323
- I was just beat up.
- I've been shot worse than this.

13:51.414 --> 13:53.155
Drive.

14:02.925 --> 14:05.132
(door opens, closes)

14:05.219 --> 14:07.381
Tara: Hey.

14:07.472 --> 14:09.588
You just get back?

14:09.682 --> 14:12.219
Yeah. I was looking for you.

14:12.310 --> 14:14.722
I was looking for you, too.

14:17.231 --> 14:19.563
I wanted to tell you that you were right

14:19.650 --> 14:21.687
when you didn't kill Dwight.

14:23.529 --> 14:25.941
We wouldn't have gotten this far
without him.

14:27.658 --> 14:30.366
The thing is, I know what you said.

14:30.453 --> 14:32.694
But after this, I'm gonna kill him.

14:34.874 --> 14:37.286
I want it to be me.

14:39.003 --> 14:41.085
Maybe it could be you and me both.

14:42.507 --> 14:44.418
And maybe we don't
got to wait so long.

14:46.511 --> 14:48.502
(metal creaking, hammering in distance)

14:54.435 --> 14:56.426
(indistinct conversations in distance)

14:59.941 --> 15:01.932
(metal creaking, hammering)

15:06.155 --> 15:08.237
Alden:
What are they building?

15:10.243 --> 15:12.075
Don't worry about it.

15:14.872 --> 15:17.284
Did you sign up for this?

15:17.375 --> 15:19.833
When you joined your group?

15:29.595 --> 15:31.677
(walker growling in distance)

15:37.061 --> 15:40.645
Alden: I was--
I was by myself for a while.

15:40.731 --> 15:42.813
Then I found a safe place.

15:44.110 --> 15:47.023
Bunch of survivors,
bunch of tough guys, too.

15:48.489 --> 15:50.856
Eventually, one of them took over,
and another one took over,

15:50.950 --> 15:53.442
but I wasn't really paying much attention

15:53.536 --> 15:55.823
'cause, you know, I was gettin' fed.

15:58.708 --> 16:00.574
I'm good with my hands.

16:03.254 --> 16:05.040
They sent me over to the satellite place

16:05.131 --> 16:07.623
to put up a fence.

16:07.717 --> 16:09.754
Now here we are.

16:11.179 --> 16:13.796
Now my life depends on
the lady in charge in there.

16:13.890 --> 16:15.221
You can stop now.

16:18.227 --> 16:20.935
Don't pretend that any of us
are innocent.

16:24.984 --> 16:27.817
What do they call you? Jesus?

16:27.904 --> 16:30.236
Well, Jesus, I'm, uh...

16:31.574 --> 16:33.485
I'm no angel.

16:35.286 --> 16:36.902
Never said I was.

16:38.164 --> 16:40.075
Ain't no such thing.

17:01.229 --> 17:03.391
Why did you need to come out here?

17:09.862 --> 17:12.980
The second they rolled out to
the Sanctuary and I wasn't with them...

17:16.993 --> 17:19.736
it's like this...

17:21.165 --> 17:23.781
siren's been going off in my head.

17:26.087 --> 17:28.704
I can't turn it off.

17:31.384 --> 17:33.000
I helped get this started.

17:33.094 --> 17:35.176
It's been a day and a half.

17:35.263 --> 17:38.051
And I have felt every second.

17:38.140 --> 17:40.222
So I just need to see it.

17:42.603 --> 17:45.095
Turn that alarm off in my head

17:45.189 --> 17:48.557
and turn around and go back home.

17:59.078 --> 18:00.694
Okay-

18:02.039 --> 18:03.279
Okay-

18:03.374 --> 18:05.160
(music plays in distance)

18:05.251 --> 18:07.458
Stop the car.

18:13.718 --> 18:15.755
(music plays in distance)

18:15.845 --> 18:17.506
Listen.

18:17.597 --> 18:19.554
(music plays in distance)

18:23.352 --> 18:25.343
(music plays in distance)

18:28.524 --> 18:30.982
I don't think that sound
could reach the Sanctuary.

18:31.068 --> 18:33.230
I don't, either.

18:34.530 --> 18:36.771
But we don't know.

18:36.866 --> 18:38.857
(woman vocalizing,
music playing in distance)

19:03.601 --> 19:05.592
(woman vocalizing,
music playing in distance)

19:16.572 --> 19:18.563
(walker growling)

19:48.771 --> 19:49.761
H9)!-

19:53.567 --> 19:55.274
It was my dad.

19:55.361 --> 19:57.944
They-- They were warning shots
above your head.

20:00.241 --> 20:02.107
He wasn't shooting at you.

20:04.120 --> 20:06.077
I'm Carl.

20:15.798 --> 20:17.209
Siddiq.

20:18.509 --> 20:20.125
Food and water.

20:24.849 --> 20:26.931
Why?

20:27.017 --> 20:28.883
I guess you--.

20:28.978 --> 20:31.561
You were talking about
something your mom said...

20:31.647 --> 20:33.558
about helping people.

20:35.151 --> 20:38.269
And my mom told me
that you got to do what's right.

20:38.362 --> 20:41.605
It's hard to know what that is sometimes,
but sometimes it's not.

21:05.139 --> 21:07.130
(panting)

21:13.189 --> 21:14.429
Thanks.

21:15.775 --> 21:17.061
Glad I found you.

21:17.151 --> 21:19.062
You were looking for me?

21:20.529 --> 21:22.111
Yeah, I-- I scavenged the sardines,

21:22.198 --> 21:23.438
other stuff.

21:23.532 --> 21:26.695
Me and my dad, we're in a community.

21:31.749 --> 21:33.706
I'm gonna ask you a few questions.

21:33.793 --> 21:35.955
I need you to answer honestly, okay?

21:36.045 --> 21:37.535
Okay-

21:38.798 --> 21:41.460
How many walkers have you killed?

21:41.550 --> 21:43.507
I know it's hard to keep track--

21:43.594 --> 21:45.426
237.

21:47.056 --> 21:49.172
Really?

21:50.559 --> 21:52.141
Give or take a couple.

21:55.898 --> 21:57.889
How many people have you killed?

22:00.319 --> 22:01.855
One.

22:01.946 --> 22:03.482
Why?

22:06.867 --> 22:09.279
The dead tried to kill him, but...

22:10.329 --> 22:12.070
they didn't.

22:15.835 --> 22:16.996
You're making walker traps.

22:17.086 --> 22:19.327
Is that how you killed so many?

22:20.714 --> 22:22.921
It's-- It's only part of it.

22:24.885 --> 22:28.844
My mom thought or hoped
that killing them would...

22:31.141 --> 22:32.802
free their souls.

22:37.940 --> 22:39.101
You know?

22:39.191 --> 22:41.148
Maybe» Maybe she was right.

22:41.235 --> 22:43.818
Doing that, doesn't that just
make things harder for you

22:43.904 --> 22:45.565
while you're trying to survive?

22:47.366 --> 22:49.607
L-- I don't know.

22:49.702 --> 22:50.908
Inn:

22:51.620 --> 22:54.863
But you gotta--
you gotta honor your parents, right?

22:56.375 --> 22:59.163
If I was honoring my dad,
we wouldn't be talking right now.

23:01.964 --> 23:05.082
And definitely wouldn't bring you back
to my community.

23:27.072 --> 23:29.063
(walkers growling in distance)

23:41.712 --> 23:43.123
(gunshots)

23:54.558 --> 23:58.096
I told you not to follow me!

23:58.187 --> 24:00.019
Do you know what happens to kids

24:00.105 --> 24:01.595
when they go wandering around
in the woods?

24:01.690 --> 24:04.307
They never get seen again,
and if they do, they're monsters.

24:04.401 --> 24:06.312
- Is that what you want?
- I'm not scared.

24:07.404 --> 24:09.145
Then you're stupid.

24:09.239 --> 24:11.526
You need fighters, so I'm fighting.

24:11.617 --> 24:13.278
(scoffs)

24:13.369 --> 24:16.452
Just now, were you gonna go back
to the Saviors' place by yourself?

24:17.957 --> 24:19.789
Let me go with you.

24:19.875 --> 24:22.913
I have to get the guys
who killed my brother.

24:29.635 --> 24:30.875
(sighs)

24:30.970 --> 24:33.712
Can't just walk around with that stick.

24:35.557 --> 24:37.264
You know how to use it?

24:37.351 --> 24:39.217
I watched you train people.

24:41.271 --> 24:43.512
(sighs) Stay close.

24:44.900 --> 24:48.143
The safety stays on
until I say otherwise.

24:53.909 --> 24:55.900
(hammering, banging in distance)

24:59.999 --> 25:01.910
Still not worried?

25:05.295 --> 25:07.036
(door opens)

25:14.596 --> 25:16.928
Maggie says to bring them in.

25:38.954 --> 25:40.786
Get them in.

25:46.754 --> 25:48.119
Come on.

25:48.213 --> 25:50.250
Two at a time.

25:54.178 --> 25:56.419
Maggie: Starting now,
we'll keep the prisoners here.

25:56.513 --> 25:58.299
We'll feed them.

25:58.390 --> 26:00.722
We won't mistreat them.

26:00.809 --> 26:03.722
But we won't stand for anything less
than total cooperation.

26:04.480 --> 26:06.346
Uh...

26:06.440 --> 26:09.774
Margaret, all-- all due respect,

26:09.860 --> 26:12.477
I'm just straight-shooting here.

26:12.571 --> 26:15.279
You can't let people we don't trust

26:15.365 --> 26:17.606
run around inside our walls.

26:17.701 --> 26:19.612
You're right, Gregory.

26:20.954 --> 26:24.072
In fact, I couldn't stop thinking about
what you told me yesterday.

26:25.084 --> 26:27.746
You see, I grew up on a farm.

26:27.836 --> 26:30.328
I know all about sheep and wolves.

26:32.466 --> 26:34.958
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

26:35.052 --> 26:36.383
- Come on, Gregory.
- Let go of me.

26:36.470 --> 26:38.006
No.

26:38.097 --> 26:40.634
Kal, are you serious? Eduardo?

26:40.724 --> 26:42.214
Wait! This-- This can't--

26:42.309 --> 26:43.925
- Wait.
- Eduardo: Calm down.

26:44.019 --> 26:45.350
No, don't tell me to calm down.

26:45.437 --> 26:46.643
I am not gonna go in there.

26:46.730 --> 26:48.266
You can't! Maggie!

26:48.357 --> 26:49.472
Look, just-- No, wait, stop!

26:49.566 --> 26:50.931
- Just for a minute!
- Calm down!

26:51.026 --> 26:52.642
No, please, no!

26:52.736 --> 26:54.318
No!God!

26:57.491 --> 26:58.697
(groaning)

26:58.784 --> 27:00.491
(crying)
Oh, God. I didn't do anything.

27:00.577 --> 27:01.988
I didn't do anything.

27:02.079 --> 27:03.160
<i>'__</i>

27:06.291 --> 27:08.282
(crying)

27:29.189 --> 27:32.227
Oh, honey...

27:32.317 --> 27:34.433
you're gonna get these people killed.

27:35.863 --> 27:38.070
Well, you already got
some people killed, didn't you?

27:38.157 --> 27:39.989
(chuckles)

27:43.620 --> 27:45.076
Alden: Hey.

27:45.164 --> 27:47.405
Thank you.

27:47.499 --> 27:49.661
Don't make me regret it.

27:50.752 --> 27:52.538
Or you will.

28:02.598 --> 28:04.589
(walkers growling in distance)

28:12.316 --> 28:14.307
(walkers growling in distance)

28:21.992 --> 28:23.983
(walkers growling in distance)

28:33.128 --> 28:35.290
Carl: Okay.

28:35.380 --> 28:37.087
For your mom.

29:06.828 --> 29:09.320
Siddiq: Just go!
You don't have to do this!

29:43.073 --> 29:44.313
(gunshon

29:59.965 --> 30:01.455
Siddiq: You okay?

30:05.262 --> 30:07.173
Yeah.

30:12.728 --> 30:13.809
You could've left.

30:23.447 --> 30:24.858
Carl.

30:30.954 --> 30:33.036
I'm responsible for you now.

30:33.123 --> 30:35.364
That's how it works.

30:37.044 --> 30:39.786
I don't want to make any trouble.

30:39.880 --> 30:41.587
Your dad didn't want anything
to do with me.

30:41.673 --> 30:43.835
He didn't, but...

30:43.925 --> 30:46.963
sometimes kids
have to find their own way

30:47.054 --> 30:49.045
to show their parents the way.

31:23.006 --> 31:24.997
(clattering, banging)

31:27.844 --> 31:30.131
Leo: There was an RV out front
that was all burned to hell.

31:30.222 --> 31:32.589
Think it was that asshole Rick's ride.

31:32.682 --> 31:35.014
Zia: Okay. So?
Negan torched the piece of shit.

31:35.102 --> 31:37.935
- So what?
- Or-- Or they did.

31:38.021 --> 31:39.307
Think about it.

31:39.398 --> 31:41.480
That gate was ripped open.

31:41.566 --> 31:44.308
And an RV bomb is one hell of
a dinner bell for the dead.

31:44.403 --> 31:45.893
Yeah, but that doesn't mean
there was a fight.

31:45.987 --> 31:47.978
Come on, Zee, there had to be.

31:48.073 --> 31:50.314
That was definitely a battle back there.

31:50.409 --> 31:51.740
And I'm betting

31:51.827 --> 31:53.784
it was all about surrounding
the big house.

31:53.870 --> 31:55.531
Probably with some rots
from the Herdway.

31:55.622 --> 31:57.613
Yeah, well, whatever happened,
whatever is happening,

31:57.707 --> 31:59.163
Rick the prick, or whoever,

31:59.251 --> 32:01.788
he don't know shit
about "The Fat Lady" here.

32:01.878 --> 32:04.245
What's been done
can be undone real quick.

32:04.339 --> 32:06.546
We get her singing,
we save their asses.

32:06.633 --> 32:09.091
And I think
Negan's gonna give us a leg up.

32:09.177 --> 32:10.508
No more of this scavenging bullshit.

32:10.595 --> 32:11.756
Well, then, get it done, then.

32:11.847 --> 32:13.303
Come on.

32:19.271 --> 32:21.262
(tools clanging)

32:35.203 --> 32:37.615
That about does it.

33:10.780 --> 33:11.815
Zia: Check the perimeter!

33:11.907 --> 33:13.614
Make sure no one else is here.

33:13.700 --> 33:14.815
Yeah.

33:22.250 --> 33:24.366
(Leo whistles)

33:29.633 --> 33:31.544
(whistles)

33:37.015 --> 33:38.426
(whistles)

33:49.194 --> 33:50.776
(clatters)

34:05.126 --> 34:06.958
Zia:
You don't look so good, girl.

34:07.045 --> 34:08.911
Somebody tune you up?

34:11.967 --> 34:13.253
Leo!

34:13.342 --> 34:14.708
Get your ass to the Sanctuary!

34:14.803 --> 34:16.339
Leave 'em to me!

34:28.483 --> 34:29.893
Rosita, stop him!

34:35.282 --> 34:37.614
Rosita: Drop it.

34:39.661 --> 34:43.120
Baby girl,
you're not gonna use that thing.

34:55.342 --> 34:58.005
- (engine starts)
- Michonne: Rosita!

34:58.096 --> 34:59.757
(tires squeal)

34:59.848 --> 35:01.839
(woman vocalizing)

35:06.062 --> 35:08.053
(woman vocalizing)

35:12.277 --> 35:13.859
(music stops)

35:25.206 --> 35:27.868
Jesus, that was too close.

35:27.959 --> 35:29.495
Yeah.

35:29.586 --> 35:31.168
It was.

35:36.551 --> 35:38.588
Daryl:
Truck full of speakers, huh?

35:38.678 --> 35:40.294
That was a Savior.

35:40.388 --> 35:41.719
Michonne: Yeah, it was.

35:41.806 --> 35:44.673
They were scavenging
when you guys attacked the Sanctuary.

35:44.768 --> 35:47.226
They saw all the walkers around it.

35:47.312 --> 35:49.553
It's a cache.

35:49.648 --> 35:51.434
They were gonna try
and drive the walkers away.

35:51.524 --> 35:52.810
That's why they were out here.

35:54.402 --> 35:56.689
Why are you guys out here?

36:00.950 --> 36:03.317
I need to see the Sanctuary.

36:03.411 --> 36:05.448
We both do.

36:07.707 --> 36:09.038
Why are you out here?

36:09.125 --> 36:11.162
We got a lot more work to do.

36:11.252 --> 36:13.414
All of us.

36:27.852 --> 36:30.139
- Jerry: He's still not seeing anyone.
- Jerry...

36:31.940 --> 36:33.897
stand next to Henry.

36:38.655 --> 36:40.316
Cover your ears.

36:41.449 --> 36:42.439
Yo!

36:44.202 --> 36:45.784
The door's not locked.

36:53.002 --> 36:55.164
Ezekiel:
I know what you want from me...

36:56.923 --> 36:58.834
what I should be doing.

37:02.345 --> 37:03.927
But I can't.

37:04.973 --> 37:06.930
People out there need you.

37:17.110 --> 37:20.068
Who the hell was I to choose for them?

37:21.406 --> 37:22.988
You're their king.

37:24.242 --> 37:26.654
'Cause I said I was a king.

37:27.787 --> 37:29.448
I Played a part.

37:31.666 --> 37:33.282
And early on,

37:33.376 --> 37:36.289
I was shown that the stakes
were these people's lives.

37:37.672 --> 37:39.754
And I still played the part.

37:41.885 --> 37:43.467
I knew.

37:45.388 --> 37:47.880
And yet I smiled.

37:48.933 --> 37:51.049
I can't do it no more.

37:53.605 --> 37:55.346
(breathes deeply)

37:55.440 --> 37:57.522
I can't be what they need.

37:57.609 --> 38:00.271
So, please just...

38:02.197 --> 38:04.564
leave me alone.

38:25.887 --> 38:28.379
Why did you keep coming to visit me?

38:30.016 --> 38:31.757
It was my duty.

38:34.938 --> 38:36.554
To make sure you were okay.

38:37.899 --> 38:40.140
I was okay.

38:41.820 --> 38:44.312
WhY did you really?

38:47.909 --> 38:49.570
You just...

38:56.626 --> 38:58.458
made me feel real.

39:03.091 --> 39:04.547
Not a fiction.

39:08.012 --> 39:09.673
Real.

39:18.356 --> 39:20.222
You are real.

39:23.111 --> 39:24.522
To me.

39:25.947 --> 39:28.530
To the Kingdom.

39:33.162 --> 39:36.245
Those people need their king
to lead them.

39:38.543 --> 39:40.534
You.

39:40.628 --> 39:42.619
You could lead them.

39:46.092 --> 39:48.049
But it has to be you.

39:52.724 --> 39:55.261
You inspired them to build this place...

39:57.228 --> 39:59.390
to believe in something.

40:03.276 --> 40:05.859
You have to help them grieve,

40:05.945 --> 40:08.858
to move on, to end this.

40:11.284 --> 40:13.116
You owe them that.

40:14.662 --> 40:16.619
Henry needs you.

40:21.628 --> 40:23.835
Those people need King Ezekiel.

40:25.965 --> 40:29.174
And if you can't be the king,

40:29.260 --> 40:32.127
then do what you do best
and play the part.

40:33.765 --> 40:36.097
I have to act every day.

40:37.393 --> 40:38.929
It used to bother me.

40:39.020 --> 40:40.806
But this is who I am,

40:40.897 --> 40:42.854
and I am still standing.

40:44.192 --> 40:47.605
I just have to act like
everything is normal until it is.

40:47.695 --> 40:51.108
It's what they need,
and it's what you have to give them.

41:00.833 --> 41:02.449
I can't.

41:12.053 --> 41:14.044
(indistinct conversations)

41:23.356 --> 41:25.438
You already screwed up once.

41:25.525 --> 41:27.186
I'm not gonna let you get us all killed.

41:27.276 --> 41:30.189
You think they're gonna kill us?

41:31.906 --> 41:33.567
Just keep it together.

41:33.658 --> 41:35.865
This place is gonna be ours.

41:43.418 --> 41:46.956
I keep... forgetting he's gone.

41:50.008 --> 41:53.296
I have this... weight.

41:55.805 --> 41:58.467
There's moments when I--

41:58.558 --> 42:01.425
I think I'll see him,

42:01.519 --> 42:04.853
that I'll, uh...

42:04.939 --> 42:08.273
be able to talk about
how I'm feeling with him.

42:10.611 --> 42:12.818
And my mind catches up,

42:12.905 --> 42:16.864
and I remember that the pain

42:16.951 --> 42:20.410
is about knowing
that it will never happen.

42:21.664 --> 42:23.575
I know that feeling.

42:25.001 --> 42:26.708
(sighs)

42:26.794 --> 42:30.037
- Does it get easier?
- No.

42:30.131 --> 42:32.543
But it helps to do something about it.

42:37.722 --> 42:39.133
How is he?

42:39.223 --> 42:40.964
Jesus: Gregory's fine.

42:41.059 --> 42:43.767
He's trying to suck up
to the Saviors now.

42:43.853 --> 42:46.311
I just wanted to say,
I think you did the right thing.

42:46.397 --> 42:49.059
- And I wanted to thank you.
- Don't.

42:50.651 --> 42:52.813
(Gracie cries)

42:55.782 --> 42:58.444
The Saviors in that pen
might be bargaining chips.

43:02.205 --> 43:04.572
Maybe we'll have to trade them
for some of our own people.

43:05.792 --> 43:08.033
They're alive
'cause we might need them.

43:10.213 --> 43:13.456
Jesus, if we don't...

43:14.967 --> 43:16.833
we can't let them live.

43:31.234 --> 43:32.724
Enid: Where are you going?

43:35.571 --> 43:36.777
(sighs)

43:38.908 --> 43:41.024
To make sure we win.

43:43.913 --> 43:45.654
Let me come with you.

43:47.041 --> 43:48.782
You're right.

43:48.876 --> 43:50.708
We need to win.

43:56.843 --> 43:59.301
Grab your stuff.

43:59.387 --> 44:01.628
And some food.

44:01.722 --> 44:04.134
We might be gone for a while.

44:18.114 --> 44:20.151
(air brakes hiss)

44:22.160 --> 44:23.992
(engine shuts off)

44:27.665 --> 44:30.077
Daryl: Here you go.
You wanted to see it.

44:42.763 --> 44:44.549
So what do you need us for?

44:44.640 --> 44:46.756
To end this thing-- right now.

44:46.851 --> 44:47.841
(engine starts)

45:41.072 --> 45:43.063
(theme music playing)
