WEBVTT

00:03.276 --> 00:04.442
Hurry! It's coming!

00:06.000 --> 00:12.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

00:14.547 --> 00:15.413
Climb!

00:18.906 --> 00:19.888
We're almost there.

00:20.853 --> 00:22.136
Can't make it.

00:22.321 --> 00:23.488
Shut up and run!

00:55.174 --> 00:56.073
You okay?

00:57.444 --> 00:59.359
Yeah, I'm okay. Go on back to sleep.

00:59.626 --> 01:01.274
Was it the one with the train again?

01:02.195 --> 01:02.929
Yeah.

01:03.557 --> 01:04.772
And now your head aches?

01:06.322 --> 01:08.881
Yeah. No. I don't know. I'm just...

01:08.980 --> 01:13.514
I'm gonna go watch some TV and make some potato salad.

01:14.373 --> 01:16.979
- Potato salad?
- Yeah. The cookout.

01:17.074 --> 01:20.033
Alan and Kamala's tomorrow... today.

01:21.058 --> 01:23.930
Allison... it's been what? Like two weeks now?

01:24.012 --> 01:25.682
I don't know, Joe. Something like that.

01:26.655 --> 01:29.106
Every night, it's the same dream. Every night, you wake up.

01:29.199 --> 01:31.851
You can't get back to sleep. Every night, I wake up.

01:32.194 --> 01:33.023
I'm sorry.

01:33.290 --> 01:37.232
I'm not looking for apologies, sweetie. I'm looking for a solution. I mean, this can't go on.

01:37.298 --> 01:40.195
- I told you, I'll go sleep in the other room.
- That's not a solution.

01:40.283 --> 01:42.715
Well, it's the best I can do at 3:44 in the morning.

01:43.210 --> 01:44.681
Maybe it's time to get some help.

01:44.908 --> 01:45.726
Help?

01:46.095 --> 01:49.383
I don't know. Maybe there's somebody out there you can talk to, like a professional, or...

01:49.458 --> 01:52.249
A psychic shrink? A shrink for psychics?

01:52.371 --> 01:55.946
An abnormal behaviorist for paranormal people? Yeah.

01:56.007 --> 01:57.204
All right, you're making fun of me.

01:57.296 --> 01:58.805
I don't think there's any help for this.

01:58.907 --> 02:02.076
To be honest... I'm just... tired.

02:02.179 --> 02:03.840
Then come back to bed.

02:04.128 --> 02:05.449
I don't think that's a good idea.

02:05.549 --> 02:07.871
I don't really care what you think. Bed, woman.

02:13.966 --> 02:17.025
- I'm so exhausted.
- Well, close your eyes.

02:20.361 --> 02:21.579
What's the point?

02:21.767 --> 02:23.051
Come on, you have to try.

02:46.617 --> 02:47.563
I give up.

03:34.009 --> 03:36.392
That's absurd. That is an absurd assertion.

03:36.463 --> 03:39.264
You're telling me the drug companies are no longer interested in developing cures?

03:39.560 --> 03:40.534
You think about it.

03:40.697 --> 03:42.601
You're talking about a business whose lifeblood...

03:42.975 --> 03:45.637
you'll pardon the pun... is sick people.

03:45.991 --> 03:48.499
If everyone's well, then nobody needs drugs.

03:48.813 --> 03:51.137
That's why the most forward-thinking drug companies

03:51.204 --> 03:54.583
are putting their money into developing drugs that treat symptoms.

03:54.830 --> 03:57.158
Treat the symptom but don't cure the illness.

03:57.327 --> 04:00.342
It's the illness that's going to keep making you the money down the road.

04:00.517 --> 04:02.739
It's the illness that's your bread and butter.

04:02.917 --> 04:04.581
Someone's had enough to drink.

04:05.514 --> 04:06.962
Would that be me, darling?

04:10.701 --> 04:11.613
You wanna see something?

04:11.953 --> 04:12.692
Look!

04:13.783 --> 04:15.867
What do you think? Are you ready to talk dowry yet?

04:16.108 --> 04:18.132
They are cute, aren't they?

04:18.529 --> 04:21.733
But I think I'm going to encourage her to play the field till she's four or five.

04:24.080 --> 04:25.453
So, how do you think we're doing?

04:25.534 --> 04:27.561
Do you thing the party's achieved lift-off?

04:27.658 --> 04:28.456
What do you mean?

04:29.234 --> 04:30.336
I don't know.

04:31.215 --> 04:33.658
My friends from the university and his friends from the lab.

04:33.720 --> 04:36.199
I'm just not sure everyone's mixing too well.

04:36.561 --> 04:37.391
Alan?

04:37.990 --> 04:39.066
Your wife's getting anxious.

04:39.132 --> 04:42.015
Stop talking to everybody you see every day at work and go mix.

04:45.008 --> 04:46.166
Aye, aye.

04:47.217 --> 04:47.902
Thank you...

04:52.713 --> 04:53.632
How's your head?

04:54.128 --> 04:58.102
Pounding. If I wasn't so exhausted, I'd shoot myself.

05:04.000 --> 05:04.824
Wait!

05:05.000 --> 05:05.783
Excuse me!

05:06.748 --> 05:07.512
Excuse me.

05:08.880 --> 05:10.323
Just waiting for the bathroom.

05:18.602 --> 05:21.797
So... what is it exactly that you're postulating?

05:21.931 --> 05:27.276
I'm saying that we are containers for a form of energy-- a soul, an essence of being.

05:27.347 --> 05:30.291
And as we all know, energy cannot be destroyed.

05:30.435 --> 05:35.514
So what happens to it when the soul's container is used up, stops working?

05:35.904 --> 05:40.009
Well, I'm exploring the idea that perhaps it lingers.

05:40.085 --> 05:41.760
At least some of it, anyway.

05:42.196 --> 05:46.737
And I think that there are people that can not only see this energy,

05:46.849 --> 05:48.416
but can communicate with it.

05:49.185 --> 05:52.487
Now, when we identify people who seem to have this ability--

05:52.548 --> 05:55.538
and they seem to exist all over the globe--

05:55.651 --> 05:58.717
we ask them to come to our lab so we can measure their accuracy.

06:01.871 --> 06:03.966
Thank you so much. It was so great.

06:05.099 --> 06:08.288
Oh, I'm so sorry. I haven't been getting any sleep.

06:08.516 --> 06:10.975
You poor thing. You seeing anyone? 'Cause I can...

06:11.032 --> 06:13.591
Just a lot of late-night TV. It'll pass.

06:13.730 --> 06:15.829
Hey, when are we going to get these two together again?

06:16.521 --> 06:19.679
Have  you guys been to Story Time at Burton's Books?

06:19.786 --> 06:20.708
No, we haven't.

06:20.836 --> 06:22.756
It is so fun.

06:22.829 --> 06:24.732
And it's great 'cause it's on Monday, when I don't have class.

06:24.794 --> 06:27.933
They dress up and they read the kids stories,

06:27.995 --> 06:30.502
and then they scream at you until you buy them the books.

06:30.574 --> 06:32.003
Oh, it sounds fun.

06:32.228 --> 06:33.498
Let's do it if I'm around.

06:33.590 --> 06:34.482
- Okay.
- Okay.

06:34.758 --> 06:35.992
- Bye, Ray.
- Say good-bye.

06:36.192 --> 06:38.204
- Bye-bye.
- Bye now.

06:38.727 --> 06:42.960
No. I'm not walking up to a total stranger at a party, where anyone can hear, and say,

06:43.108 --> 06:45.827
"Hey, all that stuff you're talking about? I do all that stuff in my sleep.

06:45.883 --> 06:48.986
And speaking of sleep? I'm having a little problem with a reocurring nightmare.

06:49.038 --> 06:50.260
Could you maybe help with that?"

06:50.343 --> 06:52.892
I wasn't saying you needed to talk to him right then and there.

06:52.954 --> 06:54.331
I'm justst saying... if you're looking for help.

06:54.404 --> 06:55.668
But I'm not looking for help.

06:55.739 --> 06:59.467
And I'm certainly not looking to be a rat in some academic's maze.

07:00.241 --> 07:01.035
It's a dream.

07:01.726 --> 07:02.693
It'll pass.

07:05.391 --> 07:08.330
Yes, you heard me correctly. I'd like to delay the press conference.

07:08.780 --> 07:10.476
I don't know-- four hours?

07:10.941 --> 07:14.095
Obviously, I have my reasons. Of course I have my reasons.

07:15.672 --> 07:18.365
No. Don't call back and tell me how much you can get me.

07:18.422 --> 07:21.191
Call me back and tell me you've gotten me four hours.

07:24.900 --> 07:26.019
You feeling all right?

07:26.722 --> 07:29.112
Oh, no, I'm okay. I'm just a little tired.

07:29.271 --> 07:32.747
Well, I'm sorry to call at the last minute, but a situation came up over the weekend.

07:34.043 --> 07:37.585
Do you remember reading about the killing of Councilman Miguel Garcia?

07:37.852 --> 07:40.621
Councilman in the ninth district. Grew up here, in fact.

07:40.848 --> 07:41.805
Great guy.

07:41.912 --> 07:44.386
Gulf  War vet. Got his MBA right here in Arizona.

07:45.086 --> 07:48.618
Comes home, runs for office. Wins, obviously.

07:48.912 --> 07:52.730
The only thing is, his district is rife with corruption-- drugs, prostitution.

07:52.836 --> 07:56.975
Anything past 5:30 at night and the streets are a war zone.

07:57.205 --> 08:00.431
But he takes over and really starts to put the lid on things.

08:00.616 --> 08:04.051
People are starting to go out again at night, business is beginning to pick up.

08:04.195 --> 08:08.152
Then last July, he's at a ribbon-cutting ceremony for a new 24-hour market,

08:08.220 --> 08:10.098
which the neighborhood really needs.

08:10.262 --> 08:13.180
Around 9:30, he's getting into his car. Pop, pop.

08:13.754 --> 08:15.495
Two shots to the back of the head.

08:15.582 --> 08:17.036
Killer was sitting in the backseat.

08:17.118 --> 08:19.228
- Okay, now I remember this.
- Yeah.

08:19.677 --> 08:21.865
Whole district's been up in arms ever since.

08:22.140 --> 08:23.974
They want someone to pay and we have nothing.

08:24.112 --> 08:26.416
- Nothing?
- Well... next to nothing.

08:27.487 --> 08:30.743
It has all the earmarks of an organized crime hit. But beyond that...

08:31.392 --> 08:34.167
Then this weekend, the killer turned himself in.

08:34.243 --> 08:37.567
Walked into the police with his attorney and confessed.

08:37.649 --> 08:39.390
- Oh, my God, that's great.
- Yeah.

08:39.850 --> 08:40.953
Only thing is...

08:41.509 --> 08:42.585
he's 14.

08:43.684 --> 08:47.577
Nothing would make my life easier than to hand over this kid's head on a silver platter,

08:47.641 --> 08:48.755
but I just don't believe it.

08:48.812 --> 08:51.531
I can't tell you why, but I just don't believe it.

08:51.810 --> 08:55.404
I was supposed to have a press conference in 20 minutes and announce that we had our man, but...

08:55.823 --> 08:57.979
he's sitting in the conference room with his lawyer.

08:58.043 --> 08:59.552
I asked for one more interview.

08:59.707 --> 09:02.785
I'll introduce you as my assistant. You can't actually ask any questions,

09:02.853 --> 09:05.549
but I'd be very curious to know what you think.

09:07.059 --> 09:08.886
I stole the gun from my cousin.

09:09.240 --> 09:11.456
He kept it in his car for protection.

09:12.132 --> 09:13.783
When I was done, I put it back.

09:14.282 --> 09:15.723
Do you know where the gun is now?

09:16.946 --> 09:18.846
I'm sorry. I need you to speak your answer.

09:19.036 --> 09:21.518
No. My cousin's in prison.

09:21.843 --> 09:23.797
I don't know what he did with the gun.

09:25.026 --> 09:27.970
Okay. So... let's review.

09:28.578 --> 09:32.515
You knew who the councilman was. You heard that he was out to clean up the streets,

09:32.628 --> 09:34.979
shut down the prostitution, the gambling, the drugs.

09:35.066 --> 09:38.953
Your older brothers and your cousins all would say how he was making trouble for them,

09:39.030 --> 09:43.074
so you got it into your head to take care of the problem yourself.

09:43.539 --> 09:45.087
Nobody told you what to do.

09:45.162 --> 09:48.864
Nobody put you up to it. It was your idea and you... did it.

09:50.645 --> 09:52.581
I need "yes" or "no."

09:53.724 --> 09:56.012
Yes. It was my idea.

09:56.729 --> 09:58.500
Nobody told me to do it.

10:06.621 --> 10:10.016
Well, it's like I told you on the phone. What brings me here is this dream.

10:10.865 --> 10:12.043
It's chronic.

10:12.237 --> 10:14.921
All night, every night. I can't sleep, I can't function.

10:14.982 --> 10:17.737
And now it's affecting my work.

10:17.896 --> 10:21.802
And that work, you claim it does make some use of your sensitivities?

10:21.884 --> 10:24.162
I told you I'm not allowed to discuss my work.

10:24.307 --> 10:25.699
Mm-hm. I respect that.

10:25.812 --> 10:30.035
A lot of the research mediums I study work with law enforcement and almost all have to agree

10:30.087 --> 10:32.994
to some level of confidentiality in their work.

10:33.067 --> 10:35.341
I'm going to assume that's the case with you, as well.

10:36.010 --> 10:40.281
Now, if you don't mind I'd like to get some biographical data.

10:40.346 --> 10:43.290
Again, Dr. Cardwell, I mean no disrespect.

10:43.921 --> 10:45.841
I came here in the hopes that you could help me

10:45.897 --> 10:48.118
or maybe point me towards someone who could.

10:48.744 --> 10:51.237
I honestly have no interest in being studied.

10:51.607 --> 10:53.008
Now, these... what do you call them?

10:53.111 --> 10:54.156
Sensitivities.

10:54.258 --> 10:57.572
Sensitivities...are not something I ever would have chosen for myself.

10:58.838 --> 11:01.118
They make the world a much darker place.

11:01.830 --> 11:03.638
I really just want some sleep.

11:03.750 --> 11:07.155
Well, as you well know, Mrs. Dubois, there are pills for that.

11:07.233 --> 11:10.124
And you can get those from any doctor.

11:10.334 --> 11:12.768
But if you really can do what you say you can do,

11:12.819 --> 11:15.705
then there's a reason you dream the same dream every night.

11:15.767 --> 11:20.883
And frankly, I'm probably the best person around to help you figure out what it is.

11:21.200 --> 11:22.106
What do you mean?

11:22.230 --> 11:24.455
Someone... living...

11:25.516 --> 11:26.367
dead...

11:27.149 --> 11:29.551
would seem to be sending you a message, but again,

11:29.842 --> 11:33.196
none  of it is relevant if you're not really who you say you are.

11:33.273 --> 11:37.548
So, if you'd be so good as to humor me for just a little while longer,

11:37.621 --> 11:39.688
why don't we take a walk down to the lab?

11:41.127 --> 11:41.951
Circle?

11:42.888 --> 11:44.419
Are you asking me or telling me?

11:45.356 --> 11:46.534
It's a circle.

11:52.643 --> 11:53.875
An octagon.

11:58.704 --> 11:59.759
A car.

12:07.282 --> 12:08.560
A  rectangle.

12:11.468 --> 12:13.260
How's this for a psychic contradiction?

12:13.327 --> 12:15.693
I sense I'm doing really poorly at this.

12:17.074 --> 12:18.395
Just concentrate on the card.

12:18.466 --> 12:21.185
I'm too tired to concentrate, which is why I'm here.

12:21.345 --> 12:22.425
Do you want to stop?

12:25.638 --> 12:27.739
Just really focus now.

12:38.885 --> 12:39.873
A train.

12:51.768 --> 12:52.899
Mrs. Dubois...

12:54.768 --> 12:55.618
Hurry!

12:58.629 --> 12:59.407
Wait!

13:06.904 --> 13:07.747
Allison?

13:08.797 --> 13:09.626
Allison?

13:12.484 --> 13:16.579
I'm sorry. I just keep seeing these two boys running, running along the train track.

13:16.876 --> 13:18.049
A train track?

13:18.136 --> 13:20.559
Yes. And there's a train coming, a long, long train

13:20.595 --> 13:24.331
with a big "J" and a big "O" on it.

13:24.818 --> 13:27.465
It's my dream. I have it over and over again.

13:27.659 --> 13:28.807
Two boys.

13:29.047 --> 13:30.465
They're brothers, I think.

13:31.262 --> 13:32.679
One's a little older.

13:32.790 --> 13:34.914
The younger one falls.

13:36.162 --> 13:39.297
It doesn't really matter what card you hold up, that's all I see.

13:41.965 --> 13:42.779
What?

13:43.378 --> 13:47.002
When I was a boy growing up-- not far from here, actually--

13:47.986 --> 13:51.596
my brother and I, we were out way past when we promised we'd be home,

13:51.662 --> 13:55.420
and to get home, you had to go over these railroad tracks.

13:55.596 --> 13:59.901
So, we're running as fast as we can, trying to get home before anybody notices,

13:59.947 --> 14:04.351
and suddenly we realized, "Oh, no, the train's coming,"

14:04.601 --> 14:08.820
and that train, it looked like it was five miles long.

14:08.979 --> 14:11.942
If you didn't cross the tracks by the time the train went by,

14:12.169 --> 14:13.960
you would be stuck there forever.

14:15.046 --> 14:18.815
So we raced, me and Kenny, two years younger than me.

14:19.896 --> 14:22.070
He fell just before the tracks.

14:25.184 --> 14:27.400
Kenny. Kenny Cardwell.

14:28.163 --> 14:29.351
What happened?

14:29.612 --> 14:30.789
You know what happened.

14:33.159 --> 14:36.048
The train passed, he was gone.

14:37.373 --> 14:39.403
A man came, took him.

14:39.795 --> 14:40.747
Killed him.

14:41.383 --> 14:43.662
Killed three other children that summer, too,

14:44.179 --> 14:46.580
but you know all that already, don't you?

14:47.512 --> 14:48.352
No.

14:48.833 --> 14:49.699
Really.

14:54.900 --> 14:56.206
It's all right here.

15:02.816 --> 15:04.264
Who put you up to this?

15:04.710 --> 15:06.578
Nobody put me up to anything.

15:06.968 --> 15:08.125
It's my dream.

15:08.436 --> 15:11.171
I've been dreaming about these boys and this train.

15:11.418 --> 15:13.758
I guess I've been dreaming about you.

15:16.025 --> 15:18.515
I would really appreciate it if you'd leave now.

15:27.070 --> 15:28.996
I really don't know what to say.

15:56.802 --> 15:57.959
...southeast Texas as well.

15:58.055 --> 16:05.229
Right now, you can see very heavy rain near the 610 Loop and I-10 on the east side of town,

16:05.331 --> 16:07.615
but there's also some very heavy flooding...

16:09.115 --> 16:10.727
Hey, I was watching that.

16:10.836 --> 16:12.719
It's okay. You're supposed to be a psychic.

16:12.791 --> 16:14.394
You  shouldn't even need the Weather Channel.

16:15.510 --> 16:17.646
It was a joke. You can laugh later.

16:18.315 --> 16:20.155
Look, the kids are going to be up in a couple of minutes.

16:20.221 --> 16:22.275
Why don't you sneak back into the bedroom, while you still have a chance,

16:22.335 --> 16:23.524
and try and get some sleep.

16:23.636 --> 16:25.469
I'll get them off to school. I'll tell them you're sick.

16:25.575 --> 16:27.516
No, no, no. I'm okay.

16:27.706 --> 16:29.780
Beg to differ. Have you looked at your eyes lately?

16:30.747 --> 16:31.407
Bad?

16:32.069 --> 16:33.840
You should see them from my side.

16:37.281 --> 16:39.094
You don't actually have to go into work today?

16:39.165 --> 16:41.381
After I fell asleep the other day? No.

16:41.443 --> 16:45.033
In fact, I think they're revoking my clearance to get into the building.

16:46.990 --> 16:48.853
Well, now the kids are up.

16:49.140 --> 16:50.619
Who calls at 7:00 in the morning?

16:52.206 --> 16:52.902
Hello?

16:54.541 --> 16:55.463
Yeah, just a minute.

16:57.376 --> 16:58.472
It's Dr. Cardwell.

17:00.987 --> 17:02.035
Dr. Cardwell.

17:03.879 --> 17:07.022
Mrs. Dubois. I-I appreciate you coming back.

17:07.981 --> 17:08.781
Please.

17:13.790 --> 17:18.565
When I had the opportunity to reflect on what you said-- how you described your dream--

17:18.625 --> 17:23.289
I realized that you referenced the letters "J" and "O."

17:24.442 --> 17:26.679
On the train. On the locomotive.

17:27.954 --> 17:30.083
Now, I went back and double-checked.

17:30.574 --> 17:34.739
I hadn't included that fact in my account of the incident.

17:34.861 --> 17:36.443
It's nowhere in the book.

17:38.143 --> 17:39.510
So, uh...

17:40.437 --> 17:42.244
I believe I owe you an apology.

17:42.331 --> 17:44.216
You already apologized on the phone.

17:44.938 --> 17:47.810
As I explained when we first met, what I really need...

17:48.363 --> 17:49.380
is some help.

17:50.743 --> 17:53.574
Actually, maybe we can help each other.

17:53.967 --> 17:57.572
If you'd be willing, I'd love you to spend some time in the lab.

17:57.732 --> 18:02.781
I suspect that the more we study your dream, the clearer the message will become,

18:03.021 --> 18:09.765
and my hunch is that once that code is broken, the dream will abate.

18:09.866 --> 18:11.331
And how can I help you?

18:12.361 --> 18:16.267
Well... I keep thinking...

18:17.894 --> 18:21.781
perhaps it's not an accident that we met at that party,

18:22.343 --> 18:23.911
that you're having this dream.

18:25.200 --> 18:28.934
Whatever its message, I can't help but wonder

18:29.532 --> 18:31.411
if it's coming from my little brother.

18:37.940 --> 18:41.289
Look, the mayor's asking a lot of questions-- questions that I can't answer--

18:41.385 --> 18:44.274
the most important being, "Why isn't this kid being hauled off in a jumpsuit yet?"

18:44.345 --> 18:46.542
I just want to make sure we have everything we need.

18:46.614 --> 18:49.425
Everything we need? We have a confession. What else could we possibly need?

18:49.491 --> 18:51.882
I just think there might be more to it, that's all.

18:51.948 --> 18:53.689
Well, you're wrong. There is no more to it.

18:53.762 --> 18:56.394
He did a bad thing. People are angry. Now we need to put him away.

18:56.481 --> 18:58.896
Tell the mayor I get the message.

18:59.126 --> 19:02.745
I just want to make sure all our ducks are in a row and I need a little more time.

19:02.910 --> 19:04.738
- How much?
- A couple of days.

19:05.951 --> 19:08.921
I don't know if you've noticed, but it's pouring outside.

19:09.075 --> 19:11.645
I mention that because the mayor thinks of you as family.

19:11.748 --> 19:14.333
The mayor thinks of you as someone under his umbrella.

19:14.704 --> 19:16.130
Don't take too much time.

19:16.572 --> 19:18.056
We'd all hate to see you get wet.

19:23.335 --> 19:24.937
I don't know what else to tell you.

19:26.676 --> 19:28.858
It's big. It's a train.

19:30.072 --> 19:32.364
These boys are running down a dirt road.

19:33.503 --> 19:34.414
Open your eyes.

19:35.101 --> 19:36.365
A... A dirt road?

19:36.647 --> 19:39.268
- You're certain.
- Yeah. An old dirt road. Why?

19:39.416 --> 19:40.979
We grew up in Winslow.

19:41.157 --> 19:43.974
It wasn't a metropolis, but the roads were paved.

19:45.120 --> 19:46.365
What about the time of day?

19:49.652 --> 19:52.662
Just day. I don't know what time it is.

19:53.128 --> 19:55.550
The sun's out. It's daytime.

19:55.765 --> 19:58.954
It was dusk when Kenny and I raced home.

20:00.009 --> 20:03.097
It was the end of a long summer day. I remember because

20:03.195 --> 20:08.089
it was getting harder and harder to see. I always thought maybe that's why he tripped and fell.

20:08.707 --> 20:12.994
You know, if this is a message of some kind, if this is coming from your brother--

20:13.524 --> 20:16.389
he was, what, five or six when it happened?

20:17.858 --> 20:20.406
Maybe he doesn't remember the time of day.

20:20.767 --> 20:23.526
Maybe he actually remembers a dirt road.

20:27.370 --> 20:29.229
Maybe. I don't know.

20:29.342 --> 20:32.732
There are certain days-- the birth of your children, your wedding day--

20:32.809 --> 20:34.657
they're just burned into your head.

20:37.673 --> 20:40.919
The  day I lost my brother-- the day my brother died--

20:41.830 --> 20:47.072
I can tell you the shade of green the grass was under our feet as we ran.

20:48.482 --> 20:53.975
I still remember the smell of my pillowcase. I cried into it for three days.

20:54.880 --> 20:55.997
I remember...

20:58.405 --> 20:59.382
everything.

21:01.404 --> 21:03.304
Whenever I go to a funeral,

21:04.660 --> 21:06.380
I see the deceased.

21:07.368 --> 21:09.233
They seem to seek me out.

21:11.127 --> 21:14.107
Would you like me to visit your brother's grave?

21:17.349 --> 21:18.608
There is no grave.

21:19.100 --> 21:20.181
There was no body.

21:21.162 --> 21:25.136
Three other kids disappeared that summer in that area.

21:26.543 --> 21:29.252
They finally caught the man who did it, just before Halloween.

21:29.331 --> 21:34.295
I remember hearing how the father of one of the other little boys shot him

21:34.628 --> 21:37.705
just as he was being transferred from the courthouse to the jail.

21:38.053 --> 21:39.512
Never did confess.

21:39.988 --> 21:42.806
Never did tell anyone where the bodies were.

21:46.460 --> 21:48.872
Can I ask you to do one more thing?

21:52.753 --> 21:54.520
These things belonged to my brother.

21:54.647 --> 21:57.785
I was wondering maybe you could just go through them.

21:57.837 --> 21:59.231
See if anything comes to you.

21:59.921 --> 22:02.400
- Maybe Kenny... 
- Will communicate with me?

22:05.594 --> 22:09.235
I've given this box to a number of people over the years.

22:09.343 --> 22:10.719
Has anyone ever gotten any...?

22:20.632 --> 22:22.904
Did you or your brother have a nickname?

22:23.580 --> 22:24.257
Like?

22:24.754 --> 22:27.790
Like... Buckles...

22:28.348 --> 22:31.574
or Bucky or, or, Buckley something?

22:34.318 --> 22:36.469
You know what? I'm sorry I even mentioned it.

22:36.606 --> 22:37.553
I'm exhausted.

22:38.838 --> 22:41.081
Is there any way I could take these things with me,

22:41.389 --> 22:43.820
try and get some rest and maybe try again later?

22:44.984 --> 22:45.771
Sure.

22:46.606 --> 22:49.617
Just got a call back from the Department of Motor Vehicles. You were right.

22:49.667 --> 22:54.593
Chavo Galindo's family just registered a new car valued at over $35,000.

22:54.792 --> 22:57.788
And from what we can tell, the car wasn't financed.

22:57.896 --> 23:00.112
- You're saying they paid cash.
- Seems that way.

23:00.404 --> 23:02.489
Hm. New car, expensive defense attorney.

23:02.540 --> 23:04.669
Must be pretty lucrative, confessing to murder.

23:04.736 --> 23:07.086
But why would anyone do that, even for all the money in the world?

23:07.214 --> 23:11.321
Hey, you're 14 and poor and someone staring at life in prison

23:11.382 --> 23:14.454
offers you and your family more money than they ever dreamed of?

23:17.270 --> 23:20.230
And what are you looking at, four, five years in juvenile prison?

23:20.470 --> 23:22.344
You come out, you're a wealthy kid.

23:22.425 --> 23:24.239
You've got important friends in the neighborhood.

23:25.032 --> 23:27.393
Starts to look like a career path, doesn't it?

23:32.544 --> 23:36.634
Come on, you plastic, non-commissioned, little bastard.

23:37.453 --> 23:38.748
How long are you going to do that?

23:38.928 --> 23:40.412
Until I get something.

23:41.002 --> 23:42.490
What if you don't get anything?

23:42.583 --> 23:43.658
I'll get something.

23:44.340 --> 23:45.594
I have to get something.

23:47.617 --> 23:48.967
I'm not getting anything.

23:49.214 --> 23:50.813
Allison, it's the weekend.

23:51.273 --> 23:54.574
It's been raining for a day and a half. The girls are going out of their minds.

23:55.569 --> 23:57.094
How about we take them to the movies?

23:57.632 --> 23:58.436
Now?

23:58.589 --> 24:01.620
Come on. I can't handle the three of them by myself. What do you say?

24:01.906 --> 24:05.658
You've been staring at Action Figure Andy and "Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots" all day.

24:05.710 --> 24:08.373
When we get back, you can stare at them some more.

24:13.918 --> 24:16.078
- Stop that.
- What?

24:16.335 --> 24:19.391
The movie hasn't even started yet and you're already sneaking looks at your watch.

24:36.195 --> 24:39.118
It was supposed to be a search for their mother.

24:39.605 --> 24:40.563
We're almost there.

24:41.383 --> 24:42.534
I can't make it!

24:42.989 --> 24:44.209
Shut up and run!

24:44.296 --> 24:45.406
Am I awake?

24:45.852 --> 24:47.383
What are you talking about? Of course you're awake.

24:47.459 --> 24:52.799
But this summer, Nate and David Carmichael will find much more than they bargained for.

24:52.872 --> 24:53.634
Damn.

25:06.629 --> 25:07.346
Hey.

25:07.797 --> 25:08.415
Hi.

25:09.788 --> 25:10.786
What you doing?

25:11.401 --> 25:12.757
Just watching you.

25:13.177 --> 25:17.023
What's the matter? They all out of weather on Channel 77?

25:18.277 --> 25:19.435
Couldn't sleep.

25:21.154 --> 25:23.203
3:17-- what a shock.

25:24.442 --> 25:25.215
The train?

25:25.532 --> 25:28.870
That, and I keep hearing Cardwell's voice when I called him on the phone

25:28.937 --> 25:30.831
to tell him about the coming attraction.

25:31.313 --> 25:32.325
How'd he take it?

25:33.262 --> 25:35.967
You know, he's a scientist. You know how they are.

25:36.168 --> 25:39.038
Mm. Just a bundle of emotion, huh?

25:39.966 --> 25:41.239
Very logical.

25:42.202 --> 25:43.514
I should have known.

25:43.575 --> 25:47.948
Then he reminded me of all the inconsistencies between my dream and his memories.

25:48.158 --> 25:49.473
Damn scientists.

25:50.431 --> 25:51.414
Damn logic.

25:52.172 --> 25:55.219
But I could sense his sadness, his disappointment.

25:57.052 --> 26:00.360
I like to believe these things come to me for a reason.

26:01.563 --> 26:04.516
That there's a meaning and a purpose to all of it.

26:05.347 --> 26:07.062
But maybe that's just ego.

26:07.942 --> 26:09.632
Maybe it's all random.

26:10.711 --> 26:13.584
I dreamed a movie's coming attraction.

26:14.757 --> 26:16.584
And maybe that's all it is,

26:17.239 --> 26:19.446
is a movie's coming attraction.

26:26.506 --> 26:28.847
I'm happy to bargain, I'm happy to be flexible.

26:28.899 --> 26:31.078
What I'm not happy to be is taken advantage of.

26:31.735 --> 26:36.419
Well, remind your client that the luxury yacht market in Arizona is limited at best,

26:36.507 --> 26:40.054
and if this drags on any longer, I might just lose my yen for buying his boat.

26:41.812 --> 26:44.719
I'm sorry, I have to go now. Just think about what I said.

26:45.697 --> 26:46.551
Manuel.

26:47.361 --> 26:48.098
Nyles.

26:49.025 --> 26:51.165
I'm happy for you-- you and the mayor.

26:51.237 --> 26:53.107
Putting this messy business to bed.

26:53.490 --> 26:57.054
I meant to ask you the other day-- how does an expensive piece of manpower like you

26:57.109 --> 27:00.306
come to represent a fatherless boy whose mother makes $11 an hour?

27:00.611 --> 27:02.249
This is America, Manny.

27:02.388 --> 27:04.671
Everyone is entitled to a vigorous defense.

27:05.121 --> 27:07.739
And I live here, too. I care about my community.

27:07.897 --> 27:08.839
I'm sure you do.

27:10.304 --> 27:11.526
It's 3:30.

27:12.004 --> 27:15.915
Those news trucks out there are going to want to hear from us before Oprah signs off.

27:16.023 --> 27:17.477
- Let's talk numbers?
- Absolutely.

27:18.358 --> 27:20.655
Obviously, we're looking for what you're looking for.

27:20.820 --> 27:23.036
That's why we're here. That's why we confessed.

27:23.099 --> 27:25.346
No trial, no muss, no fuss.

27:25.914 --> 27:30.036
We're thinking four years in a juvenile institution, no probation

27:30.201 --> 27:32.831
and you expunge the charges when he's released.

27:34.629 --> 27:36.769
You've met the boy. He's got a clean record.

27:36.846 --> 27:39.186
Some dubious relatives, but a clean record.

27:39.298 --> 27:41.429
I truly believe this is aberrant behavior,

27:41.516 --> 27:44.372
and I truly believe this is the appropriate punishment.

27:45.854 --> 27:48.397
So, can we put this to bed?

27:49.969 --> 27:51.468
I'll certainly think about it.

27:52.918 --> 27:53.901
Excuse me?

27:55.417 --> 27:58.738
Your client confessed to the cold-blooded murder of a pillar of the community.

27:58.775 --> 28:00.674
I think that warrants some thought.

28:01.130 --> 28:02.206
I'll be in touch.

28:06.788 --> 28:07.818
You wanted to see me?

28:08.437 --> 28:10.096
Yes. Thanks for stopping by.

28:10.197 --> 28:12.906
No. I'm glad you called. I felt very badly about last week.

28:13.005 --> 28:16.085
- Obviously you were feeling ill... 
- I haven't been sleeping and...

28:17.971 --> 28:20.279
- You first.
- No... just...

28:20.893 --> 28:24.800
Look, I could have used your help, yes, but at that moment, for whatever reason,

28:24.866 --> 28:27.095
you didn't have help to give me. I understand.

28:27.780 --> 28:30.872
But I'm hoping today will be different.

28:31.983 --> 28:32.951
What are these?

28:33.520 --> 28:36.885
I have reason to believe that one of these four men may be the one who's bankrolling

28:37.002 --> 28:41.139
14-year-old Chavo Galindo's defense and siphoning money to his family.

28:41.297 --> 28:45.357
It doesn't seem unreasonable to suppose that whoever's spending hundreds of thousands of dollars

28:45.425 --> 28:50.670
to implicate this boy probably had a hand in the killing of Councilman Miguel Garcia.

28:50.739 --> 28:53.636
- And you were hoping...?
- That you might be able to tell me...

28:53.703 --> 28:54.916
From these pictures?

28:57.011 --> 28:59.505
I gotta tell you, I'm still not at my best.

28:59.663 --> 29:01.763
The sleeping thing I was telling you about,

29:01.839 --> 29:05.617
and for some reason whenever I close my eyes I see this movie train.

29:05.689 --> 29:07.648
So you're not getting anything?

29:08.081 --> 29:09.370
No. I'm sorry.

29:10.215 --> 29:12.370
Oh, well... It's okay.

29:12.842 --> 29:15.771
At the end of the day, all I would've been doing is adding your hunch to my own,

29:15.838 --> 29:19.236
and it would take a lot more than a couple of hunches to stop this juggernaut.

29:19.702 --> 29:24.091
Can I hold on to these? Who knows, maybe tonight everything will break open, and...

29:24.223 --> 29:25.150
Of course.

29:26.564 --> 29:28.771
So what does the rest of the day hold for you?

29:30.168 --> 29:32.682
Gee, it looks like I could still make story time.

29:32.870 --> 29:33.859
Nice.

29:34.971 --> 29:35.703
Well...

29:36.526 --> 29:37.582
wish me luck.

29:38.360 --> 29:40.126
I feel a press conference coming on.

29:43.705 --> 29:47.679
"Grizz Brickbottom was the toughest cowboy ever

29:47.770 --> 29:51.401
to drive a herd of cattle across the open range.

29:51.488 --> 29:57.760
Grizz was so tough he could drink a quart of Tabasco sauce a day."

29:58.713 --> 30:01.626
This is a great idea. Marie's loving this.

30:01.703 --> 30:04.273
I know. This is one of Jason's favorite things, too.

30:07.033 --> 30:10.738
You know, I can just see it now. I'm going to be buying cowboy stuff for the next year and a half.

30:10.826 --> 30:12.798
Not us. We'll be buying ponies.

30:12.889 --> 30:13.940
Ponies.

30:18.819 --> 30:21.282
"Based on a novel by Ken Buckley."

30:21.456 --> 30:23.074
Buckley? Buckley?

30:24.691 --> 30:26.847
Kamala, can you excuse me a second?

30:26.935 --> 30:27.508
Yeah.

30:29.868 --> 30:31.199
Okay, let's look at this...

30:33.467 --> 30:36.067
"Based on a novel by Ken Buckley."

30:40.233 --> 30:44.722
"Ken Buckley was born in 1964 "and still lives in rural Holbrook, Arizona,

30:44.782 --> 30:47.768
not far from the railroad tracks, where he grew up hearing the stories

30:47.804 --> 30:52.124
of the lives forever altered by the mighty locomotives that would pass through his town."

30:52.847 --> 30:54.167
Ken Buckley...

30:58.710 --> 31:00.291
Kenny Cardwell.

31:11.224 --> 31:12.144
What you doing?

31:12.533 --> 31:13.961
Looking up something on the map.

31:14.862 --> 31:16.163
Making a break for it, huh?

31:16.793 --> 31:20.259
No matter where you go, Allison, I will find you.

31:21.375 --> 31:23.817
Holbrook. Where Ken Buckley lives.

31:24.032 --> 31:25.952
Looks to be about 70 miles away.

31:26.357 --> 31:27.042
So?

31:28.220 --> 31:29.740
So I'm going to drive there tomorrow.

31:30.530 --> 31:31.468
You mean today.

31:32.089 --> 31:34.729
After I take the kids to school and drop Marie off at day care.

31:36.929 --> 31:40.862
See if maybe I can talk to Ken Buckley. See if there's any way possible he's Kenny Cardwell.

31:41.579 --> 31:43.546
Remember what that doctor said about my dream?

31:43.622 --> 31:46.781
That the dream would abate the more I understood its message.

31:48.239 --> 31:51.021
Well, the funny thing is, after I saw the coming attraction,

31:51.275 --> 31:55.332
as disappointing as it was for Dr. Cardwell, it kind of helped my sleeping.

31:55.444 --> 31:57.344
Really? It's 4:00 in the morning.

31:57.431 --> 31:58.332
Exactly.

31:58.735 --> 32:00.359
And I slept over four hours.

32:00.831 --> 32:03.161
I only had the train dream three times.

32:03.380 --> 32:05.434
It's not perfect yet, but it's getting better.

32:05.705 --> 32:07.286
I feel like I'm getting closer.

32:09.416 --> 32:11.301
Is that the best you can do, "Wha...?"

32:12.032 --> 32:14.408
What do you want me to say? It's 4:00 in the morning.

32:15.130 --> 32:16.846
I don't know-- good luck.

32:17.111 --> 32:19.140
I mean, think about it. What's the downside?

32:19.241 --> 32:22.039
So, I knock on this guy's door. So, he opens it.

32:22.360 --> 32:26.104
And he's black or he's really young or he's really old or he isn't even there

32:26.150 --> 32:28.930
'cause he moved to California to be closer to his seven brothers and sisters,

32:28.981 --> 32:30.737
who he's been close to all his life.

32:30.856 --> 32:33.646
And I say, "I'm sorry, my mistake."

32:34.490 --> 32:36.231
But at least I'm doing something.

32:36.514 --> 32:39.691
At least I'm chasing the train and the train's not chasing me.

32:39.795 --> 32:40.629
You know what?

32:40.983 --> 32:41.720
Good luck.

32:42.913 --> 32:43.727
Thank you.

32:45.284 --> 32:47.065
Come on, you know it's 4:00 in the morning?

32:47.172 --> 32:48.135
We should be in bed.

32:58.227 --> 32:58.965
Morning.

32:59.287 --> 33:00.060
Morning.

33:00.525 --> 33:03.383
I'm looking for Ken Buckley.

33:03.925 --> 33:05.728
He's not here right now.

33:06.009 --> 33:07.400
He'll be back soon.

33:08.071 --> 33:09.864
But he's not here right now.

33:10.996 --> 33:13.981
Okay, maybe I'll go get a cup of coffee and I'll come back.

33:20.648 --> 33:22.583
I know you're tired.

33:22.763 --> 33:24.718
I know you haven't slept.

33:25.522 --> 33:28.788
And I'm sorry I haunted your dreams.

33:29.694 --> 33:33.217
But I haven't slept in almost 20 years.

33:34.002 --> 33:41.210
For 20 years, I stood outside the gates of Heaven feeling nothing

33:42.275 --> 33:45.869
but the heat of hell beneath me,

33:46.575 --> 33:48.192
calling me home.

33:51.598 --> 33:53.487
I know I'm a bad person.

33:54.092 --> 33:56.456
I know I've done bad things.

33:57.173 --> 33:59.258
But I need to put this to rest.

34:00.216 --> 34:01.982
I need your help.

34:10.857 --> 34:14.100
Mr. District Attorney, I was starting to think you'd forgotten about us.

34:14.690 --> 34:17.295
Oh, I'm a lot of things, but forgetful isn't one of them.

34:17.373 --> 34:18.692
Please, have a seat.

34:24.224 --> 34:25.697
- So.
- So.

34:25.801 --> 34:28.268
I've given your client's situation a great deal of thought.

34:28.339 --> 34:30.244
- I'm sure.
- And here's what I'd like to propose.

34:30.761 --> 34:33.501
16 years. Arizona State Correctional Facility.

34:33.567 --> 34:36.051
That, of course, assumes that your client stands by his confession

34:36.110 --> 34:37.971
and the state avoids the expense of a trial.

34:38.021 --> 34:38.911
But I...

34:40.429 --> 34:43.465
With all due respect, Manuel, that is not a deal.

34:43.565 --> 34:45.743
- That is a maximum sentence.
- No.

34:46.203 --> 34:49.388
The maximum sentence for murder one is death by injection.

34:49.639 --> 34:51.880
The more likely sentence is life in prison.

34:52.261 --> 34:55.286
And that's what I'm guessing he'll get if we try him as an adult,

34:55.378 --> 34:56.699
which we're prepared to do.

34:56.790 --> 34:58.778
At least, this way, he gets out when he's 30.

34:59.807 --> 35:01.753
It's not nearly as bad as it sounds.

35:01.906 --> 35:03.432
They say it's the new 20.

35:03.616 --> 35:05.003
But he's confessed.

35:05.193 --> 35:07.252
Yes, he did. And in great detail.

35:07.303 --> 35:10.620
Which is the only reason I'm even entertaining this generous deal I'm proposing.

35:11.958 --> 35:13.415
Come on, Chavo.

35:14.041 --> 35:14.982
Think about it.

35:15.740 --> 35:18.793
Whatever you're getting for this, is it worth what you're going get for this?

35:19.038 --> 35:20.006
Who was it?

35:21.076 --> 35:23.515
- It w...
- Who was who?

35:23.620 --> 35:27.804
District Attorney Devalos, I really do need you to address all your questions to me.

35:27.896 --> 35:31.147
- I did this on my own.
- Do... not... speak!

35:35.771 --> 35:37.327
Is that your final offer?

35:37.424 --> 35:38.821
It's my only offer.

35:39.548 --> 35:43.363
And in my opinion, if you're interested in doing what's best for your client, you'll accept it.

35:44.310 --> 35:47.197
I'm sorry, son, but taking the rap for murder is not,

35:47.264 --> 35:50.024
nor will it ever be, a career opportunity in the city of Phoenix.

35:50.086 --> 35:55.108
If you decide to rethink your confession, your attorney has my number.

36:02.798 --> 36:04.013
Mr. Buckley?

36:05.682 --> 36:06.566
Can I help you?

36:06.670 --> 36:09.436
I don't know. I'm actually here on behalf of your mother,

36:09.521 --> 36:11.421
or the woman who brought you up, I mean.

36:11.821 --> 36:13.480
I'm sure you're mistaken.

36:13.644 --> 36:15.747
My mother, the woman who brought me up,

36:16.012 --> 36:18.001
she's been dead for quite sometime now.

36:18.098 --> 36:21.759
Since 1985. I know. I'm also here on behalf of your brother.

36:22.987 --> 36:28.569
Ma'am, I don't know who you are or what you want, but I don't have a brother.

36:28.661 --> 36:31.286
Well, yeah, you do and you wrote about him in your book.

36:34.283 --> 36:35.009
Ken?

36:36.202 --> 36:38.444
Does the name "Cardwell" ring a bell?

36:41.651 --> 36:42.484
Does it?

36:44.036 --> 36:44.696
No.

36:47.164 --> 36:49.049
I don't know. Maybe.

36:51.185 --> 36:52.479
Tell me that name again.

36:54.719 --> 36:58.956
It was a story my mom told me all the time about two boys running.

36:59.094 --> 37:03.228
The youngest one falls just before he reaches the tracks and a kind woman finds him...

37:03.289 --> 37:05.958
Mr. Buckley, that story is your story.

37:06.082 --> 37:07.379
I don't know what you mean.

37:08.080 --> 37:10.784
Connie Buckley, the woman who raised you...

37:11.484 --> 37:12.382
My mother.

37:13.882 --> 37:16.734
Her son, the one she gave birth to,

37:16.896 --> 37:19.678
died of scarlet fever when he was seven months old.

37:19.979 --> 37:21.659
His death devastated her.

37:21.736 --> 37:24.726
She became despondent and morose, her husband left her.

37:24.854 --> 37:27.362
My father died when I was a baby.

37:27.578 --> 37:29.324
Then, one day, she got a gift.

37:30.066 --> 37:32.002
The gift was a little boy.

37:32.620 --> 37:35.867
And unlike the boy in your story or the movie they made from it,

37:35.990 --> 37:37.993
he was barely four years old.

37:38.796 --> 37:40.111
She took you home...

37:40.981 --> 37:42.682
just for dinner at first.

37:43.531 --> 37:45.994
Then she decided that you were hers to keep.

37:46.727 --> 37:49.579
As luck would have it, you came into her life during a summer

37:49.690 --> 37:52.911
where three other children met a far less pleasant fate

37:52.993 --> 37:55.937
at the hands of someone even more twisted than Connie.

37:56.505 --> 38:00.079
The two of you lived in Nevada for two years, then you moved back here.

38:00.203 --> 38:02.081
She told you she was your mother.

38:02.174 --> 38:05.077
Every day she'd tell you, every day you'd cry.

38:05.349 --> 38:08.795
Until one day, you just didn't cry anymore.

38:11.743 --> 38:15.518
This brother of mine you say you're working for...

38:15.600 --> 38:17.236
He'd very much like to meet you.

38:19.255 --> 38:21.881
Everything that I've told you is a matter of public record--

38:21.998 --> 38:25.466
the death of Connie's son, all the stories from when you went missing.

38:27.550 --> 38:29.392
I know it's a lot to digest.

38:30.264 --> 38:31.379
When you're ready...

38:33.503 --> 38:34.353
call.

38:37.666 --> 38:39.581
Oh, and by the way...

38:40.477 --> 38:42.862
Connie Buckley, the woman who raised you?

38:43.302 --> 38:46.145
She wanted you to know that she truly loved you.

38:46.728 --> 38:48.628
And she's truly sorry.

39:01.530 --> 39:02.346
Allison?

39:04.234 --> 39:05.104
Allison?

39:05.406 --> 39:07.284
Hey, babe, it's 7:30.

39:08.166 --> 39:09.277
You overslept.

39:09.964 --> 39:12.359
Oh, my God, I slept through the night.

39:12.492 --> 39:14.581
And did we, perchance, dream of trains?

39:15.334 --> 39:18.646
- Not once.
- Planes, buses? Any form of transit?

39:19.513 --> 39:21.919
Cool. I could use a hand. Marie wet her bed.

39:31.673 --> 39:32.614
Kenny?

39:45.379 --> 39:47.365
Can you ever forgive me?

39:47.847 --> 39:49.393
What are you talking about?

39:49.710 --> 39:51.118
I tripped, man.

39:51.615 --> 39:52.886
I tripped.

39:54.942 --> 39:56.627
I am so sorry.

40:04.672 --> 40:06.218
You got another dollar I could borrow?

40:06.366 --> 40:07.089
No.

40:08.338 --> 40:09.914
Wait a minute, what time is it?

40:10.375 --> 40:12.311
Uh, 9:35.

40:12.561 --> 40:13.411
Damn.

40:13.519 --> 40:16.976
This guy made me promise I'd be where no one could see me by 9:00.

40:17.073 --> 40:18.147
We gotta go, man.

40:50.518 --> 40:51.193
Hello.

40:51.264 --> 40:54.719
So sorry to call in the middle of the night, but suddenly it all became clear.

40:54.812 --> 40:57.352
Slow down, Allison. Start at the beginning.

40:57.429 --> 40:58.678
Okay. Sorry.

40:58.964 --> 41:03.408
I'm sorry, it's just... it's just, I just had a dream about your 14-year-old murderer.

41:03.480 --> 41:06.122
I saw where he was when he was supposed to be killing the councilman.

41:06.220 --> 41:07.955
He was at a video arcade.

41:08.042 --> 41:10.269
And not only that, but there was a security camera.

41:10.397 --> 41:13.418
and I'm betting that if we look at the security tapes of the day in question

41:13.495 --> 41:15.270
- and look at the time stamp...
- Allison.

41:16.269 --> 41:20.816
We sent Chavo to a medium security facility, pending trial, two days ago.

41:21.877 --> 41:26.208
His first night there, he was stabbed to death by an inmate who wanted his toothbrush.

41:30.558 --> 41:31.702
Allison?

41:35.046 --> 41:36.014
You okay?

41:37.437 --> 41:38.420
Yeah.

41:40.902 --> 41:43.160
Sure. I guess so.

41:47.626 --> 41:51.737
Listen, I'm going to go back to sleep.

41:53.406 --> 41:54.358
How about you?

41:55.971 --> 41:56.954
I don't know.

41:59.984 --> 42:00.952
Maybe.

42:02.597 --> 42:03.768
Maybe not.
