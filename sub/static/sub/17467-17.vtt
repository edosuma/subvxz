00:01.653 --> 00:03.786
Hi, Bonnie, alcoholic.

00:03.828 --> 00:04.917
GROUP: Hi, Bonnie.

00:04.961 --> 00:07.050
Well, [sighs]
as if being a single mom

00:07.094 --> 00:08.660
wasn't stressful enough...

00:08.704 --> 00:09.922
[softly]:
What?

00:09.966 --> 00:11.185
...I'm also the manager

00:11.228 --> 00:12.751
of an apartment building.

00:12.795 --> 00:14.753
Anyway, the owners of the
building have started this thing

00:14.797 --> 00:17.191
called an
"annual performance evaluation,"

00:17.234 --> 00:19.671
which is worrisome 'cause,
uh....

00:19.715 --> 00:22.413
no one in the building
really likes me.

00:22.457 --> 00:24.720
So, I called Marjorie
and she said,

00:24.763 --> 00:26.504
[imitating Marjorie]:
"Bonnie, nothing changes

00:26.548 --> 00:27.940
"if nothing changes.

00:27.984 --> 00:29.899
"Just do one
thing different

00:29.942 --> 00:32.336
and see what happens."

00:32.380 --> 00:34.686
Do I really
sound like that?

00:34.730 --> 00:36.123
No.

00:36.166 --> 00:37.689
So, starting today,

00:37.733 --> 00:40.736
when a tenant asks me
to fix something,

00:40.779 --> 00:42.477
I'm gonna give 'em this finger

00:42.520 --> 00:45.088
instead of the one
I want to give 'em.

00:45.132 --> 00:47.960
Thanks.

00:48.004 --> 00:49.658
Who'd like to go next?

00:49.701 --> 00:50.789
I will.

00:50.833 --> 00:52.052
Hi, I'm Jill, I'm an alcoholic.

00:52.095 --> 00:53.140
GROUP:
Hi, Jill.

00:53.183 --> 00:54.445
Well, I have my final meeting

00:54.489 --> 00:55.794
with my caseworker today,
where they tell me

00:55.838 --> 00:58.014
if I'm approved
to be a foster parent.

00:58.058 --> 01:00.495
I've done everything
they asked--

01:00.538 --> 01:03.019
I put a big ugly fence
around my pool,

01:03.063 --> 01:06.022
childproofed my whole kitchen.

01:06.066 --> 01:08.416
It takes me ten minutes
to get a damn cracker.

01:10.635 --> 01:12.985
I am terrified.

01:13.029 --> 01:14.726
I want this so bad.

01:14.770 --> 01:16.772
I called Marjorie about it.
She said,

01:16.815 --> 01:18.687
[imitating Marjorie]: "Jill,
you are in the actions business.

01:18.730 --> 01:20.906
God is in the results business."

01:20.950 --> 01:23.518
You sure
I don't sound like that?

01:23.561 --> 01:25.911
Not at all.

01:25.955 --> 01:27.913
So, I guess we'll see
what God's got in mind

01:27.957 --> 01:30.046
this afternoon at 1:30.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.701
Wouldn't hurt if y'all said
a little prayer for me.

01:32.744 --> 01:33.919
Thank you.

01:37.053 --> 01:40.143
If you want, I'll go
to your appointment with you.

01:40.187 --> 01:41.144
You'd do that?

01:41.188 --> 01:42.276
Of course.

01:42.319 --> 01:44.060
It's like
Marjorie always says,

01:44.104 --> 01:46.367
[imitating Marjorie]:
"Christy, in this program,

01:46.410 --> 01:48.760
we never have to
do anything alone."

01:51.285 --> 01:53.504
You don't really sound
like that.

01:57.769 --> 01:59.380
WOMAN:
Excuse me, sweetie,

01:59.423 --> 02:01.860
are you here with a grown-up?

02:02.992 --> 02:05.429
I am a grown-up.

02:05.473 --> 02:06.691
Oh, I'm sorry.

02:06.735 --> 02:08.345
I thought you were
a foster child.

02:10.217 --> 02:14.177
If you have a spare mother,
I'm open to it!

02:14.221 --> 02:16.527
Hey, what'd they say?

02:16.571 --> 02:17.615
Let's just go.

02:17.659 --> 02:19.791
Wait, what happened?

02:19.835 --> 02:20.923
They turned me down.

02:20.966 --> 02:22.403
Why?

02:22.446 --> 02:25.188
My caseworker thinks I haven't
been sober long enough.

02:25.232 --> 02:27.059
I can apply again in a year.

02:27.103 --> 02:28.583
Oh, Jill.

02:28.626 --> 02:30.062
I'm not saying I'm gonna do it,

02:30.106 --> 02:32.195
but this is kind of
a Xanax moment.

02:32.239 --> 02:34.110
No, hold on. This isn't right.

02:34.154 --> 02:35.633
Wait here.

02:36.982 --> 02:38.723
Hey! You listen to me.

02:38.767 --> 02:40.203
You are making a
gigantic mistake

02:40.247 --> 02:41.726
turning down Jill Kendall.

02:41.770 --> 02:43.554
We're both in AA
and I can tell you

02:43.598 --> 02:45.600
she is totally committed
to her sobriety.

02:45.643 --> 02:48.385
Thank you. And she will make
one hell of a foster mother!

02:48.429 --> 02:50.257
There's a poor little
child out there

02:50.300 --> 02:52.911
who needs her, and shame on
you for standing in the way!

02:52.955 --> 02:54.086
Shame!

02:57.046 --> 02:58.961
â™ª

03:13.584 --> 03:15.282
Sorry I'm late.Where have you been?

03:15.325 --> 03:17.284
Managing a 32-unit
apartment building.

03:17.327 --> 03:19.024
Some of us work for
a living, Wendy.

03:19.068 --> 03:20.765
I'm an emergency room nurse.

03:20.809 --> 03:22.245
And I actually help people.

03:24.204 --> 03:26.380
Case in point,
Mrs. Slivkin in 2E

03:26.423 --> 03:28.295
now has a working light
fixture in her bathroom.

03:28.338 --> 03:31.602
Ignoring her took six months,
fixing it took six minutes.

03:31.646 --> 03:33.996
There's a lesson
in there somewhere.

03:34.039 --> 03:36.303
[phone rings]

03:36.346 --> 03:38.218
[groans]
It's my caseworker.

03:38.261 --> 03:39.871
What does she want,
to reject me again?

03:39.915 --> 03:41.438
[ringing continues]

03:41.482 --> 03:43.135
Hey, Barbara, what's up?

03:45.225 --> 03:46.661
That's amazing.

03:46.704 --> 03:48.750
Your crazy little outburst
changed her mind.

03:48.793 --> 03:53.494
You should have seen me.
I actually spit a little.

03:53.537 --> 03:55.191
Really, already?

03:55.235 --> 03:57.062
They have a child for me.

03:57.106 --> 03:58.455
Awesome.That's great.
Wow.

03:58.499 --> 04:01.197
Uh-huh.
It's a little girl named Emily.

04:01.241 --> 04:02.981
Oh, I always wanted a girl.

04:08.117 --> 04:10.075
Oh, that's perfect.

04:10.119 --> 04:11.338
She's 14 months old.

04:11.381 --> 04:12.513
Oh...Oh...

04:12.556 --> 04:13.514
Baby shower.

04:13.557 --> 04:15.167
Excuse me, what?

04:15.211 --> 04:17.168
14 yearsold.

04:17.213 --> 04:19.607
Oh.
Ooh.
Ooh.

04:19.649 --> 04:21.826
Uh-huh.

04:21.870 --> 04:24.002
I'm sorry,
can I call you right back?

04:24.046 --> 04:27.049
[clears throat]
Thanks.

04:27.092 --> 04:30.052
Teenage girl, she's bounced
around the system for a while,

04:30.095 --> 04:32.097
dad's gone, mom's an addict.

04:32.141 --> 04:34.665
She sounds like our people.

04:34.709 --> 04:36.188
What are you thinking?

04:36.232 --> 04:37.712
I don't know.

04:37.755 --> 04:39.975
I mean, this whole time,
I've only pictured myself

04:40.018 --> 04:41.368
with a baby.

04:41.411 --> 04:43.631
I can't dress a teenage girl
like a bumblebee

04:43.674 --> 04:45.937
and make it my Christmas card.

04:45.981 --> 04:48.853
But think about all the good
you can do for this girl.

04:48.897 --> 04:51.769
Yeah, I lived this. No one wants
an older foster kid.

04:51.813 --> 04:53.989
You're like one of those
hot dogs at the gas station

04:54.032 --> 04:56.818
that's been on the roller
too long.

04:56.861 --> 04:59.429
You have a chance to do
something wonderful here.

04:59.473 --> 05:00.474
CHRISTY:
Right.

05:00.517 --> 05:02.040
You can help this girl
not turn into

05:02.084 --> 05:03.825
an old hot dog
like my mom.

05:08.612 --> 05:11.267
Do you have to give 'em
an answer right away?

05:11.311 --> 05:13.225
No, the next step would be

05:13.269 --> 05:15.140
to meet and see
if we like each other.

05:15.184 --> 05:16.751
I guess I can do that much.

05:16.794 --> 05:18.361
[phone chimes]

05:18.405 --> 05:19.536
Damn it.

05:19.580 --> 05:20.624
What?

05:20.668 --> 05:21.930
Slivkin. I fixed the light

05:21.973 --> 05:23.192
in her bathroom,
now she can see

05:23.235 --> 05:25.020
the black mold in her shower.

05:25.063 --> 05:26.717
No good deed, huh?

05:26.761 --> 05:29.459
Siri, what is black mold?

05:33.289 --> 05:34.377
What do you think?

05:34.421 --> 05:37.989
Does this say fun foster mom?

05:38.033 --> 05:41.253
It says Prince died and
all I got was this lousy hat.

05:42.864 --> 05:44.605
It's not really you.

05:44.648 --> 05:46.650
What about now?

05:47.912 --> 05:49.131
Take the hat off, Jill.

05:49.174 --> 05:50.915
[groaning]: Oh, God.

05:50.959 --> 05:52.787
Now that this thing
is starting to get real,

05:52.830 --> 05:54.310
I'm totally freaking out.

05:54.354 --> 05:56.181
I don't even know
what she should call me.

05:56.225 --> 05:58.880
I mean, I'm not her mom,
"Jill" sounds too familiar,

05:58.923 --> 06:01.448
and "Mama Jill" sounds like
I run a whorehouse.

06:03.363 --> 06:05.365
You were a foster kid.

06:05.408 --> 06:07.149
What'd you call the people
who took you in?

06:07.192 --> 06:08.368
Unlucky.

06:10.500 --> 06:11.936
So, where are you
meeting this girl?

06:11.980 --> 06:14.852
My caseworker's
bringing her to the bistro.

06:14.896 --> 06:16.724
It's like the scariest
first date of my life

06:16.767 --> 06:18.203
and I went out
with Dennis Rodman.

06:20.858 --> 06:25.428
Okay, we need to come back
to that eventually.

06:25.472 --> 06:27.822
But, for today, just relax.

06:27.865 --> 06:29.214
Talk about
clothes and boys.

06:29.258 --> 06:30.738
It's your wheelhouse.

06:30.781 --> 06:32.914
In a lot of ways, you
are a 14-year-old girl.

06:34.219 --> 06:36.265
You always know
just what to say.

06:39.311 --> 06:41.096
So, how's it going
with all the tenants

06:41.139 --> 06:42.489
evaluating your
performance?

06:42.532 --> 06:44.795
How do you think it's going,
Christy?

06:47.189 --> 06:48.364
Sorry.

06:48.408 --> 06:50.192
Yeah. On the plus side,

06:50.235 --> 06:52.020
I have learned a lot
about myself.

06:52.063 --> 06:53.717
Really? Like what?

06:53.761 --> 06:56.285
Well, apparently, your mother
rubs people the wrong way.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.201
No.

06:59.244 --> 07:01.464
I was surprised, too.

07:01.508 --> 07:03.074
Then, I read
some of the reports.

07:03.118 --> 07:04.336
They let you see them?

07:04.380 --> 07:06.295
I may have steamed open
a couple envelopes.

07:06.338 --> 07:08.079
And get this:

07:08.123 --> 07:12.127
people described meas
"lazy, untrustworthy,"

07:12.170 --> 07:13.868
and in one memorable instance,

07:13.911 --> 07:16.348
"a useless broomstick
with hair."

07:16.392 --> 07:18.394
Ouch.
[chuckles]

07:18.438 --> 07:21.092
Hey, one tenant called you
my pet mouse.

07:21.136 --> 07:23.399
That's so mean,
I didn't do anything.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.183
Oh, stop squeaking.

07:25.227 --> 07:26.663
So, what's gonna happen?

07:26.707 --> 07:28.622
If you lose this job,
we lose the apartment.

07:28.665 --> 07:32.321
Thanks, I'd actually forgotten
that for a couple of minutes.

07:32.364 --> 07:34.192
Hang on.

07:34.236 --> 07:37.369
Siri, remind me to pick up
mousetraps on the way home.

07:41.156 --> 07:43.375
[laughs]What?

07:43.419 --> 07:46.030
"Broomstick with hair."

07:48.772 --> 07:50.513
[phone rings]

07:50.557 --> 07:52.689
It's Jill.

07:52.733 --> 07:53.647
Are you gonna answer it?

07:53.690 --> 07:54.909
Kind of have to.

07:58.913 --> 08:00.088
Hi.

08:00.131 --> 08:01.568
I just want to
thank you guys again

08:01.611 --> 08:03.308
for being here with me.

08:03.352 --> 08:04.832
She's thanking us
for being here.

08:04.875 --> 08:06.616
I can hear her.

08:06.660 --> 08:09.532
You sure you don't want to
sit with us?

08:09.576 --> 08:12.230
You'll be fine.
We're right here if you need us.

08:12.274 --> 08:13.884
Oh, my God, they're here.

08:15.277 --> 08:17.235
Just remember,
boys and shopping.

08:19.411 --> 08:22.110
Or cigarettes
and shoplifting.

08:22.153 --> 08:25.069
Hi, Barbara.

08:25.113 --> 08:27.158
Hey, Emily, I'm Jill.
What's your name?

08:27.202 --> 08:28.899
Emily.

08:28.943 --> 08:31.946
[laughs]
Right, of course, sorry.

08:31.989 --> 08:33.077
Uh, please, sit.

08:36.254 --> 08:38.039
I'm a little nervous.

08:38.082 --> 08:39.909
This is my first...

08:39.953 --> 08:41.390
whatever this is.

08:41.433 --> 08:42.913
Not mine.

08:42.957 --> 08:44.306
Emily's been
in the foster system

08:44.349 --> 08:45.568
for quite
some time now.

08:45.612 --> 08:48.136
Terrific. How do you like it?

08:51.443 --> 08:54.795
Hang on, I have a hat for you.

08:54.838 --> 08:56.448
Oh, not the hat.

08:58.407 --> 09:02.367
So, tell me about yourself.
What do like to do?

09:02.411 --> 09:06.894
Um, I don't know, draw and read,
like, graphic novels.

09:06.937 --> 09:10.114
Graphic? Like dirty books?

09:10.158 --> 09:13.465
No. Uh, graphic novels
are basically comic books,

09:13.509 --> 09:15.685
maybe a little more
sophisticated.

09:15.729 --> 09:18.601
Oh, I read Archie
when I was your age.

09:18.645 --> 09:20.864
Betty or Veronica,
who's he gonna choose?

09:22.431 --> 09:25.521
Archiewas a comic book
about teenagers.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.436
And the challenging problems
they face,

09:27.479 --> 09:29.873
like "who am I gonna take
to the prom?"

09:29.917 --> 09:34.138
Why don't you tell her about the
graphic novel you're working on.

09:34.182 --> 09:37.664
It's kind of a post-apocalyptic
doomsday story.

09:37.707 --> 09:40.710
Oh, neat.
Is there a prom in it?

09:44.758 --> 09:47.630
Oh, that girl's
not gonna pick me.

09:47.674 --> 09:50.720
I've watched The Bachelorenough
to know I'm not getting a rose.

09:50.764 --> 09:53.549
Ah, come on,
there's always hope.

09:53.593 --> 09:57.379
We were there. No rose.

09:57.422 --> 09:59.555
So, it didn't work out
with this young lady.

09:59.599 --> 10:02.253
You'll take what you learned
and use it moving forward.

10:02.297 --> 10:04.081
Yeah, well, I'm hoping
for a baby next time.

10:04.125 --> 10:05.648
When babies don't like you,

10:05.692 --> 10:07.128
they have the decency
to keep it to themselves.

10:08.695 --> 10:10.131
Don't be so sure.

10:10.174 --> 10:12.481
This one's first words were,
"Leave me alone."

10:12.524 --> 10:14.222
I think it was, "Love me,"

10:14.265 --> 10:16.311
but it's interesting
that's what you heard.

10:18.400 --> 10:19.793
[cell phone rings]

10:19.836 --> 10:22.186
Hey, Barbara.

10:22.230 --> 10:24.058
Listen, I know
that didn't go well,

10:24.101 --> 10:25.407
but I am gonna
take what I learned

10:25.450 --> 10:27.975
and use it moving forward.

10:28.018 --> 10:29.541
I'm sorry, what?

10:31.631 --> 10:33.415
Oh.

10:33.458 --> 10:34.634
Emily picked me!

10:34.677 --> 10:36.984
Mama Jill's in the house!

10:37.027 --> 10:38.855
Way to go.
Congratulations.
Yay!

10:38.899 --> 10:42.293
Okay, so, do I come pick her up
or do you guys deliver?

10:42.337 --> 10:45.819
Dear God, she thinks
this is Amazon Prime.

10:45.862 --> 10:49.300
Oh. Yeah, that's great.
See you soon.

10:49.344 --> 10:50.650
I got to go.

10:50.693 --> 10:52.695
They're dropping her off
in two hours.

10:52.739 --> 10:54.436
Son of a bitch,
it is Amazon Prime.

11:01.269 --> 11:02.357
What's this?

11:02.400 --> 11:04.054
Plan B.

11:04.098 --> 11:06.187
I'm baking my famous banana
bread for all the tenants.

11:06.230 --> 11:09.103
It was only famous
'cause you put hash in it.

11:10.974 --> 11:12.759
What was plan A?

11:12.802 --> 11:15.805
Doing my job, but I'd need
a time machine for that.

11:15.849 --> 11:19.069
You think banana bread's
gonna change people's minds?

11:19.113 --> 11:21.637
No, banana bread
gets me in the door

11:21.681 --> 11:23.770
then I win them over
with my natural charm

11:23.813 --> 11:26.033
and mastery of hypnosis.

11:27.382 --> 11:29.427
Oh, God, we're moving again.

11:29.471 --> 11:30.690
Yeah, maybe.

11:30.733 --> 11:33.301
Where are you going?

11:33.344 --> 11:35.738
Over to Jill's,
see how her first night went

11:35.782 --> 11:37.044
with her foster kid.

11:37.087 --> 11:39.046
It was awkward and awful.

11:39.089 --> 11:40.438
You talked to her already?

11:40.482 --> 11:41.831
Didn't have to, I lived it.

11:41.875 --> 11:43.528
Every foster's first night
is like that.

11:43.572 --> 11:45.530
Well, I can still help.

11:45.574 --> 11:47.184
I've got experience.

11:47.228 --> 11:49.447
I could write a book
about raising a teenage girl.

11:49.491 --> 11:50.840
What would you call it,

11:50.884 --> 11:52.146
My Own Daughter
Doesn't Speak to Me,

11:52.189 --> 11:53.582
But Here's What You Should Do?

11:54.844 --> 11:57.281
Oh, and what would
you call yours?

11:57.325 --> 11:59.631
I'm Sure I Had a Kid
Around Here Somewhere.

11:59.675 --> 12:03.026
Yeah. It's not my fault you
kept taking your leash off.

12:07.727 --> 12:10.033
So, how was your first night?

12:10.077 --> 12:11.687
A little rocky.

12:11.731 --> 12:15.430
The One Direction bedspread
did not go over well.

12:15.473 --> 12:17.345
I tried to tell you.

12:17.388 --> 12:19.260
She must've liked
the heated pool.

12:19.303 --> 12:20.740
I guess.

12:20.783 --> 12:22.742
I'm still learning how
to interpret her grunts.

12:22.785 --> 12:25.657
Oh, yeah, 14-year-old girl.

12:25.701 --> 12:27.529
"How was your day?"
[grunts]

12:27.572 --> 12:29.792
"How was school?"
[grunts]

12:29.836 --> 12:32.490
It's like living with somebody
trapped under a rock.

12:33.578 --> 12:34.841
Oh, hey, there she is.

12:34.884 --> 12:36.016
How'd you sleep?

12:36.059 --> 12:36.799
[grunts]

12:38.148 --> 12:39.933
Can I get something to drink?

12:39.976 --> 12:41.848
You don't have to ask.
You live here.

12:44.807 --> 12:46.591
Emily, this is my friend,
Christy.

12:46.635 --> 12:47.767
Christy, Emily.

12:47.810 --> 12:48.724
Hi.

12:48.768 --> 12:49.943
Hi.

12:49.986 --> 12:51.596
Got any Gatorade?

12:51.640 --> 12:54.338
Oh, I'm so sorry, no,
but I do have coconut water.

12:54.382 --> 12:55.818
Do you like coconut water?

12:55.862 --> 12:58.212
I don't know.
Does it taste like coconuts?

12:59.343 --> 13:01.345
With a whisper of urine.

13:03.434 --> 13:04.871
[whispering]:
You got a smile.

13:06.133 --> 13:07.438
I'm taking an orange juice.

13:07.482 --> 13:09.571
Great. Are you hungry?

13:09.614 --> 13:11.529
I can have Soledad
make you breakfast.

13:11.573 --> 13:14.532
Pancakes, quiche,
huevos rancheros.

13:14.576 --> 13:16.143
She makes an egg white
veggie frittata

13:16.186 --> 13:17.753
that'll make you think
you're in the promised land.

13:17.797 --> 13:19.146
[whispering]:
Please make me stop talking.

13:19.189 --> 13:21.496
Come and sit down with us.

13:21.539 --> 13:23.715
Yeah, come on. Let's chat.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.377
So, you like
Rick and Morty,huh?

13:33.421 --> 13:35.031
Yeah.

13:35.075 --> 13:38.382
I got into it because of my son,
but now I love it, too.

13:38.426 --> 13:40.036
Wubba-lubba-dub-dub.

13:40.080 --> 13:41.864
[burps loudly]

13:41.908 --> 13:43.779
[laughs]

13:43.823 --> 13:45.172
[laughs nervously]

13:45.215 --> 13:46.608
What's happening?

13:50.438 --> 13:53.006
And when I close this door,

13:53.049 --> 13:56.574
you will wake up,
feel refreshed and like me.

14:02.450 --> 14:05.018
Ooh, Mr. Munson, hang on,

14:05.061 --> 14:08.151
let me get that bicycle
out of your way.

14:10.850 --> 14:14.505
Oh. Oh, well, uh,
thank you, Bonnie.

14:14.549 --> 14:16.943
That's what I'm here for.

14:16.986 --> 14:19.510
Uh, everything okay
in your apartment?

14:19.554 --> 14:21.817
You need anything fixed,
replaced, hauled off?

14:21.861 --> 14:24.689
What's wrong with you,
you back on the drugs?

14:24.733 --> 14:27.910
No, sir, I'm just
trying to do my job.

14:27.954 --> 14:30.652
Uh-huh. This have something to
do with that tenant evaluation

14:30.695 --> 14:32.045
they called me about?

14:32.088 --> 14:34.308
Did you talk to them?

14:34.351 --> 14:36.397
Not yet.

14:36.440 --> 14:38.616
All right,
let's cut to the chase.

14:38.660 --> 14:39.835
What do you want, old man?

14:39.879 --> 14:43.230
Pam Grier.

14:43.273 --> 14:45.754
Within reason.

14:45.797 --> 14:49.236
A woman who tells me
she's Pam Grier.

14:50.585 --> 14:52.935
How about banana bread
and a back rub?

14:52.979 --> 14:54.110
Deal.

14:54.154 --> 14:55.720
Come on in.

14:58.158 --> 15:00.203
Emily, these drawings
are amazing.

15:00.247 --> 15:01.465
You're really talented.

15:01.509 --> 15:02.684
Yeah, talented.

15:04.033 --> 15:05.730
What's the story?

15:05.774 --> 15:09.299
Yes, I, too,
would like to know.

15:09.343 --> 15:11.301
I don't have it all figured out,

15:11.345 --> 15:14.174
but it's about this girl
after, like, an atomic war,

15:14.217 --> 15:16.350
and she has to learn how
to survive on her own.

15:16.393 --> 15:18.656
Well, now that's
depressing.

15:18.700 --> 15:19.788
I think it's cool.

15:19.831 --> 15:21.833
Depressing and cool.

15:23.618 --> 15:24.880
So, what happens to her?

15:24.924 --> 15:28.101
I was just gonna ask that.

15:28.144 --> 15:29.624
She probably dies.

15:29.667 --> 15:30.886
Now, that's cool.

15:30.930 --> 15:31.887
No, that's depressing.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.454
Oh, I give up.

15:34.803 --> 15:36.457
Excuse me.

15:38.676 --> 15:40.809
[quietly]:
What's going on?

15:40.852 --> 15:42.332
Christy, I can't do this.

15:42.376 --> 15:44.465
You should just take
her home with you.

15:44.508 --> 15:47.163
No. I already have a daughter
I screwed up.

15:47.207 --> 15:48.382
This one's yours.

15:49.731 --> 15:51.428
But it's so awkward.

15:51.472 --> 15:53.256
I have nothing
in common with her.

15:53.300 --> 15:54.823
So what?

15:54.866 --> 15:56.433
She needs a home,
she doesn't need a buddy.

15:56.477 --> 15:58.870
I know, but I really
want her to like me.

15:58.914 --> 16:01.830
Then you shouldn't have
signed up to be a mom.

16:01.873 --> 16:06.008
Hey, how about, how about
you and Bonnie come live here

16:06.052 --> 16:07.270
and help me with her?

16:08.619 --> 16:11.100
We might have
to take you up on that.

16:11.144 --> 16:14.016
Let's see how
the banana bread goes.

16:14.060 --> 16:17.715
Oh, great. Now I don't know
what you're talking about.

16:17.759 --> 16:21.023
Christy, this was a mistake.

16:21.067 --> 16:25.027
When people don't like me
at first, they never like me.

16:25.071 --> 16:26.550
I don't have a
chance with her.

16:26.594 --> 16:28.639
That's not true.

16:28.683 --> 16:30.206
I didn't like you at first.

16:30.250 --> 16:32.861
You didn't?

16:32.904 --> 16:36.386
Nope. I thought you were
self-obsessed and spoiled

16:36.430 --> 16:38.998
and your teeth were so white
it made me angry.

16:40.086 --> 16:42.044
But then I got to know you,

16:42.088 --> 16:44.307
and now I can't imagine my life
without you in it.

16:44.351 --> 16:46.179
Now, go out there

16:46.222 --> 16:49.269
and keep talking to her until
you find some way to connect.

16:51.401 --> 16:54.404
I'm sorry, I just can't.

16:54.448 --> 16:56.319
Do you want me to leave?

16:58.234 --> 17:00.236
I can call my caseworker.

17:01.585 --> 17:04.066
No.

17:04.109 --> 17:06.676
I want you to stay
very much.

17:08.505 --> 17:11.160
I'm just so bad at this.

17:11.204 --> 17:13.684
I think you're doing okay.

17:15.034 --> 17:16.470
Really?

17:16.512 --> 17:17.775
[grunts]

17:21.040 --> 17:22.824
Did you hear what she said?

17:24.042 --> 17:27.133
She thinks I'm doing okay.

17:27.175 --> 17:29.961
I have never once heard
that from my daughter.

17:32.094 --> 17:34.140
Hang in there.

17:38.666 --> 17:40.885
Hey, Violet, it's your mother.

17:40.929 --> 17:43.975
Just checking in, haven't heard
from you in awhile.

17:44.019 --> 17:45.412
I thought maybe you and Luke

17:45.455 --> 17:47.762
might want to come over
for dinner on Sunday,

17:47.805 --> 17:49.024
unless you broke up with him,

17:49.068 --> 17:50.982
in which case,
bring the new guy.

17:51.026 --> 17:52.984
Love you, bye.

17:59.469 --> 18:02.646
Hey. What's going on here?

18:02.690 --> 18:04.779
Just chilling
with my favorite tenant.

18:04.822 --> 18:06.128
[chuckles]

18:06.172 --> 18:08.087
Okay.

18:08.130 --> 18:09.218
Hi, Beverly.

18:09.262 --> 18:10.219
Mouse.

18:13.614 --> 18:16.312
You're still gonna
wax me, right?

18:16.356 --> 18:18.619
Yeah.

18:23.928 --> 18:26.061
So, Jill, how's it going
with your foster kid?

18:26.105 --> 18:28.585
[grunts]

18:28.629 --> 18:30.979
I'm sorry, what?

18:31.022 --> 18:33.024
That's teenager for "okay."

18:34.417 --> 18:36.071
Now, you see what
happens when you...

18:36.115 --> 18:40.075
Oh, God, I do
sound like that.

18:40.119 --> 18:41.729
[cell phone chimes]

18:41.772 --> 18:43.948
Yes! Thank you, God!

18:43.992 --> 18:45.428
You passed the evaluation?

18:45.472 --> 18:48.257
Close enough.
I'm on probation!

18:48.301 --> 18:49.867
Wow.
Congratulations.Probation party!

18:49.911 --> 18:51.391
What did you do
to turn it around?

18:51.434 --> 18:54.481
A lot of things
I'm ashamed of!

18:54.524 --> 18:57.527
Waitress, a round of hot water
and lemon for my friends!
