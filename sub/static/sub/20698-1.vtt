00:50.051 --> 00:58.051
Anyone whose name is written
in this notebook shall die.

01:05.482 --> 01:11.906
A Death Note is the reaper's tool
to control mortals' life spans.

01:12.448 --> 01:20.448
Years ago a man called Kira used one,
causing genocide in the name of justice.

01:24.126 --> 01:32.126
Delighted by Kira's act,
King Death gave reapers an order.

01:33.052 --> 01:40.184
"Find a human to succeed Kira.
Give that human a Death Note."

03:34.966 --> 03:36.676
"How to use the Death Note."

03:37.218 --> 03:42.264
"Anyone whose name is written
in this notebook shall die."

04:05.162 --> 04:06.455
Bend your arm.

04:23.681 --> 04:25.517
How do you feel?

04:29.812 --> 04:31.313
Terrible.

04:33.149 --> 04:35.985
Vassily, come on.

04:36.485 --> 04:38.320
You'll be fine.

04:47.789 --> 04:49.666
Let me die.

04:52.835 --> 04:53.835
Vassily...

04:53.961 --> 04:56.673
End this for me, Doctor.

05:09.435 --> 05:11.771
I want to die.

06:07.952 --> 06:12.248
"Rest in peace, Vassily NikitoviÄ‡."

06:58.294 --> 06:59.629
Vassily.

07:00.672 --> 07:02.799
Can you hear me?

07:28.490 --> 07:30.326
It can't be...

07:32.829 --> 07:34.997
It's impossible...

08:13.703 --> 08:16.038
"How to use the Death Note."

08:16.706 --> 08:22.044
"Anyone whose name is written
in this notebook shall die."

08:22.378 --> 08:29.552
"But it's only effective when the
target's face is visualized."

08:30.386 --> 08:38.385
"Write a cause of death and modify
the victim's prior behavior."

08:40.395 --> 08:45.902
"Unless specified, the target will
die of a heart attack."

09:02.752 --> 09:04.587
Criminals dead!

09:04.754 --> 09:10.426
Much like the Kira case 10 years ago,
criminals are mysteriously dying.

09:10.718 --> 09:15.389
A new task force suggests that
the Kira killer is back.

09:15.557 --> 09:17.433
I'm Captain Sugawara.

09:17.684 --> 09:22.271
As of today you're
on the Death Note Task Force.

09:22.605 --> 09:26.818
We'll continue our
Death Note investigation.

09:27.026 --> 09:32.615
One theory is that the new Kira killer is

09:32.865 --> 09:37.995
the cyberterrorist who targets
states sponsoring terrorism.

09:38.162 --> 09:41.999
Interpol confirms this possibility.

10:36.345 --> 10:37.345
I am

10:38.347 --> 10:39.516
Kira.

10:41.058 --> 10:45.855
I control the lives and deaths
of all humans.

10:48.858 --> 10:52.529
We are connected
by blood and my intentions.

10:53.530 --> 10:55.364
I appoint you.

10:57.074 --> 10:58.868
Get the Death Note.

11:01.913 --> 11:03.372
Live as Kira.

11:19.221 --> 11:21.390
The Note is awesome!

11:23.601 --> 11:25.728
What else, Beppo?

11:29.899 --> 11:33.235
Watch me do better than Kira.

11:36.698 --> 11:42.161
Code 3. Multiple casualties
in Shibuya streets.

11:42.411 --> 11:44.914
The Death Note Task Force was sent.

11:45.414 --> 11:48.084
This is K141, 143 and 145.

11:48.250 --> 11:51.420
En route to the crime scene.

11:57.927 --> 12:02.056
- Casualties line the street.
- It's a rampage killing.

12:11.983 --> 12:13.025
Excuse me.

12:14.318 --> 12:15.361
Show me.

12:25.955 --> 12:27.874
This is totally random.

12:28.124 --> 12:29.917
The death toll's climbing.

12:30.459 --> 12:33.630
It's the reaper's eyes!
Hide your face.

12:33.963 --> 12:35.715
- Check it out.
- Roger.

12:36.465 --> 12:39.468
A suspect was seen on surveillance camera.

12:39.636 --> 12:42.639
160 cm, female, hoodie.

12:55.985 --> 12:57.153
Nanase, stay behind!

12:59.155 --> 13:00.322
Mishima!

13:02.659 --> 13:05.953
Tailing a female wearing a hood in Zone 4.

13:07.622 --> 13:09.040
At the East exit.

13:09.165 --> 13:12.043
I'm also on a female in a hoodie.

13:12.209 --> 13:13.209
In pursuit.

13:17.674 --> 13:21.468
The death toll stands at 16. Be cautious.

13:24.764 --> 13:26.015
East exit.

13:26.348 --> 13:28.184
I lost track of the suspect.

13:31.521 --> 13:33.981
Mishima, do you copy?

13:48.412 --> 13:49.412
Out of the way!

13:53.876 --> 13:55.670
Damn it!

13:59.674 --> 14:02.009
Another victim in Sakashita.

14:03.260 --> 14:04.804
I'm on my way.

14:20.528 --> 14:21.738
Are you OK?

14:25.825 --> 14:27.451
Oh my God!

14:27.619 --> 14:30.663
Murder! A murderer!

14:34.416 --> 14:37.712
Suspect spotted. She has a Note.

15:18.460 --> 15:21.297
"Akira Okawa."

15:41.609 --> 15:42.819
A murderer!

15:44.904 --> 15:46.155
Is it gas?

15:48.575 --> 15:49.784
Terrorists!

15:56.666 --> 15:58.000
Help me!

16:02.547 --> 16:03.715
Run!

16:34.621 --> 16:36.330
I'm awesome, huh, Beppo?

16:45.464 --> 16:46.883
Evacuate now!

16:47.800 --> 16:49.552
Get out of here!

16:49.761 --> 16:51.137
Now!

16:55.391 --> 16:57.894
We're not authorized to shoot!

17:29.509 --> 17:30.509
Don't!

17:40.603 --> 17:41.637
Move it!

17:41.704 --> 17:43.706
Let me through!

18:11.425 --> 18:17.139
"Sakura Aoi, heart attack,
7:50PM, Dec, 10."

18:38.494 --> 18:41.330
Why did you shoot her, Ryuzaki?

18:42.498 --> 18:45.167
To stop the casualties.

18:45.459 --> 18:47.670
I'm above the law.

18:49.964 --> 18:52.174
We're not authorized to kill!

18:52.299 --> 18:56.012
It was a tranquilizer dart!

18:58.347 --> 18:59.766
A dart...

19:05.312 --> 19:06.312
Yes?

19:06.355 --> 19:09.859
Forensics say she died of heart failure.

19:10.026 --> 19:13.029
- Heart failure?
- Told you it wasn't me!

19:13.404 --> 19:15.532
You're jumpy, Mishima.

19:16.574 --> 19:19.536
Surveillance cameras were hacked.

19:20.036 --> 19:22.038
There're other Death Notes.

19:56.363 --> 19:57.363
Let's begin.

19:59.366 --> 20:02.912
The suspect Sakura Aoi, 20
was of no fixed address.

20:03.204 --> 20:06.583
I speculate she had reaper's eyes.

20:07.584 --> 20:12.088
We know from Misa Amane
who had a Death Note 10 years ago

20:12.379 --> 20:16.425
that those with reaper's eyes
can identify people.

20:17.051 --> 20:20.262
Was Sakura Aoi the new Kira?

20:20.387 --> 20:22.599
I'm afraid not.

20:22.890 --> 20:25.101
Neo Kira imitates.

20:25.226 --> 20:28.437
Light Yagami, the original Kira.

20:29.063 --> 20:32.609
He used the Death Note to persecute

20:32.900 --> 20:35.277
felons all over the world.

20:35.737 --> 20:38.280
It reduced crime by 70%.

20:38.405 --> 20:43.536
Kira followers worship him as God.

20:44.078 --> 20:45.078
Some god!

20:46.080 --> 20:51.127
Neo Kira also targets felons,
not innocent people.

20:51.586 --> 20:54.463
Sakura Aoi is opposite to Kira.

20:56.090 --> 20:57.634
What a worn notebook!

20:57.759 --> 20:59.051
It's well used.

20:59.260 --> 21:01.470
He's a Death Note fanboy.

21:01.596 --> 21:02.629
I'm not!

21:02.655 --> 21:03.705
Fanboy?

21:03.730 --> 21:07.276
You can ask him
anything about Death Note.

21:07.602 --> 21:08.645
It's handy.

21:29.957 --> 21:31.834
Just one notebook

21:32.293 --> 21:34.504
caused so many deaths!

21:36.297 --> 21:39.175
- Unbelievable.
- It's not just a notebook.

21:39.634 --> 21:41.678
It belongs to a reaper.

21:42.136 --> 21:44.639
To humans it's a lethal weapon.

21:45.306 --> 21:47.183
We can learn from...

21:47.308 --> 21:49.018
Don't touch it!

22:09.330 --> 22:11.207
What's your name?

22:18.673 --> 22:19.882
Beppo...?

22:22.343 --> 22:23.553
What's that?

22:27.181 --> 22:28.558
Touch it.

22:48.369 --> 22:52.915
Touch a Death Note
and you can see its reaper.

22:53.040 --> 22:55.918
- Is it here?
- Yeah, brace yourself.

22:57.712 --> 22:58.713
Hold on.

22:59.046 --> 23:01.090
Beppo, make a cute face.

23:01.549 --> 23:04.594
Come on, guys.

23:04.886 --> 23:06.262
Come on.

23:41.839 --> 23:44.133
I haven't seen one for 10 years...

23:46.594 --> 23:47.637
Beppo.

23:50.347 --> 23:51.933
I have a question.

23:52.934 --> 23:54.561
What is it?

23:56.020 --> 23:59.524
How many Death Notes are in our world?

24:00.983 --> 24:02.318
Six.

24:04.445 --> 24:06.573
One is lethal enough!

24:07.990 --> 24:09.992
Will they increase?

24:10.660 --> 24:14.997
Only 6 Death Notes are allowed
in the human world.

24:15.582 --> 24:19.251
Ryuzaki is chatting with a reaper!

24:20.753 --> 24:25.341
He's Interpol's go-to guy.
And the next L.

24:25.633 --> 24:27.009
L...

24:29.470 --> 24:33.516
I stopped Kira 10 years ago.
He has a successor?

24:35.977 --> 24:38.855
I stored his DNA for cloning.

24:40.648 --> 24:41.691
I'm his clone.

24:41.816 --> 24:46.529
Your nemesis.
Say hi to a world-class P.I.

24:48.155 --> 24:49.866
What do you want?

24:51.200 --> 24:54.203
That's for you to find out.

24:55.663 --> 24:57.206
Wait!

25:02.504 --> 25:03.546
Beppo.

25:04.338 --> 25:07.717
What if there was a 7th Death Note?

25:09.135 --> 25:12.179
Any Death Note after the 6th
won't work.

25:12.388 --> 25:17.560
Except the Death Notes
that the reapers have.

25:18.019 --> 25:20.062
I didn't know that...

25:25.527 --> 25:28.195
How many Death Note rules are there?

25:28.696 --> 25:31.574
Even reapers don't know that.

26:00.853 --> 26:02.647
The suspected killer

26:03.314 --> 26:06.442
was Sakura Aoi who had a Death Note.

26:08.820 --> 26:12.615
It wasn't Ryuzaki who killed her.

26:13.032 --> 26:14.992
It was a heart attack.

26:18.204 --> 26:22.249
Did someone write her name in a Death Note?

26:22.709 --> 26:26.128
There must be another Death Note around...

26:27.797 --> 26:31.801
Only 6 Death Notes are allowed
in the human world.

26:32.009 --> 26:36.723
If I can trust Beppo,
there's only 6 Death Notes.

26:37.139 --> 26:39.851
So 5 more people have the Notes?

26:40.392 --> 26:43.354
Any Death Note after the 6th won't work.

26:44.564 --> 26:48.150
Once all the Death Notes are in vaults...

26:48.442 --> 26:53.656
Even if reapers circulate more Death Notes

26:53.948 --> 26:56.492
they couldn't kill anyone.

27:18.515 --> 27:19.849
What's going on?

27:20.683 --> 27:22.143
What's that?

27:23.520 --> 27:25.354
Try to restart it.

27:31.360 --> 27:32.360
I am...

27:32.444 --> 27:33.495
Who's that?

27:33.562 --> 27:34.562
Kira.

27:37.033 --> 27:41.704
I control the lives and deaths
of all humans.

27:43.873 --> 27:44.873
I will

27:46.292 --> 27:47.585
purify

27:48.878 --> 27:51.005
this world of vices.

27:51.881 --> 27:55.552
Kira will make a peaceful new world.

27:57.887 --> 27:59.055
I am

27:59.722 --> 28:01.057
Kira.

28:09.065 --> 28:10.608
The Kira video

28:10.733 --> 28:14.737
is a computer virus
that's spread worldwide.

28:14.904 --> 28:19.450
It hijacked computer
terminals and smartphones.

28:20.743 --> 28:22.244
The hacker's method

28:22.411 --> 28:26.457
is like the so-called Pacifist Hacker

28:27.166 --> 28:31.713
who cyberattacks states
sponsoring terrorism.

28:32.046 --> 28:35.299
Kira, the man in the video

28:35.424 --> 28:38.595
might be behind the cyberterrorism.

28:40.680 --> 28:42.389
This is the video.

28:44.934 --> 28:46.185
I am

28:46.853 --> 28:48.229
Kira.

28:49.647 --> 28:54.401
I control the lives and
deaths of all humans.

28:56.278 --> 28:58.072
I have the power.

28:59.406 --> 29:02.744
And to bring peace to the world.

29:03.995 --> 29:06.413
I eliminated fools.

29:07.915 --> 29:10.334
Kira is needed in the new world.

29:12.461 --> 29:13.461
I am

29:14.296 --> 29:15.422
Kira.

29:16.298 --> 29:17.466
Ryuk...

29:24.641 --> 29:25.642
Matsuda.

29:26.809 --> 29:28.811
Isn't Light Yagami dead?

29:29.478 --> 29:30.479
He is.

29:32.356 --> 29:35.652
I was there when he died 10 years ago.

29:37.028 --> 29:38.028
Any ideas?

29:39.113 --> 29:42.324
It might be digitally manipulated.

29:42.491 --> 29:46.579
The focus should be on
who'd have Light's image.

29:46.704 --> 29:50.416
Only a few officers knew his true identity.

29:51.042 --> 29:54.003
The power means the Death Note.

29:55.087 --> 29:56.380
You doubt us?

29:57.549 --> 29:59.676
That's my job.

29:59.801 --> 30:04.847
We don't trust you either.
We don't need your cooperation.

30:05.014 --> 30:09.686
Suits me! If I need you,
I might put you to use.

30:09.852 --> 30:11.521
That's enough!

30:12.354 --> 30:17.359
I'm more concerned
that only I can see Ryuk.

30:18.027 --> 30:19.529
Why's that?

30:20.530 --> 30:23.658
You touched Ryuk's Death Note
10 years ago.

30:23.866 --> 30:27.870
It means that Neo Kira
has Ryuk's Death Note.

30:28.370 --> 30:31.541
Light Yagami might be Neo Kira.

30:31.874 --> 30:33.751
Impossible. He's dead.

30:33.876 --> 30:37.880
Yeah? How about the Death
Notes and reapers?

30:39.549 --> 30:43.219
So Light is actually alive...

30:45.387 --> 30:46.848
Don't be happy.

30:48.600 --> 30:52.228
The Kira virus was employed to access

30:52.394 --> 30:55.231
the personal information

30:55.565 --> 31:00.903
of international VIPs, agents
and their families.

31:02.071 --> 31:06.492
So he can kill them at his will.

31:06.743 --> 31:07.744
Yes.

31:09.245 --> 31:12.582
So law enforcement agencies
are immobilized.

31:14.584 --> 31:16.753
Is our Task Force OK?

31:17.419 --> 31:20.923
No officers in the Force have families.

31:21.257 --> 31:23.593
We are untraceable.

31:24.093 --> 31:26.095
We go by pseudonyms.

31:26.303 --> 31:29.932
Only real names can be used
in a Death Note.

31:32.434 --> 31:34.604
I use my real name.

31:35.772 --> 31:36.773
Me too...

31:38.440 --> 31:41.277
Your info might have been stolen.

31:44.113 --> 31:46.616
Have the police servers checked!

31:51.788 --> 31:56.793
Tell me about the accomplice Kira
had 10 years ago. Misa Amane.

31:56.959 --> 31:58.795
Don't order me around.

31:59.504 --> 32:04.466
She couldn't be charged
for the Death Note homicides.

32:04.967 --> 32:09.138
Her memory was wiped
when she gave up her Death Note.

32:09.972 --> 32:13.142
Now she's a law abiding actor.

32:14.310 --> 32:17.313
- How can you let her off?
- It's the law.

32:17.647 --> 32:18.815
Boyfriends?

32:19.649 --> 32:22.318
No one in the past 10 years.

32:22.652 --> 32:25.822
Light was the love of her life.

32:26.238 --> 32:28.490
I'm sure he used her.

32:29.617 --> 32:34.330
The prosecutor at her trial, Mikami
went missing a year ago.

32:34.496 --> 32:36.498
- You on the case?
- Yes.

32:36.999 --> 32:40.670
His car was found at the
foot of Mount Kora.

32:47.844 --> 32:49.178
And Misa?

32:50.179 --> 32:54.183
She's under surveillance but
they found nothing.

33:11.200 --> 33:12.535
That's a wrap!

33:12.702 --> 33:14.954
Thank you!

33:17.039 --> 33:18.708
Thanks.

33:20.877 --> 33:24.046
Thank you! It was a great shoot.

33:25.047 --> 33:27.884
Thank you so much, everyone.

33:33.430 --> 33:35.224
Nothing unusual.

33:37.059 --> 33:39.729
She's off camera from here.

33:54.118 --> 33:55.327
Misa.

34:03.628 --> 34:04.837
Misa.

34:05.963 --> 34:07.173
I'm here.

34:20.770 --> 34:22.188
Light...?

34:22.938 --> 34:25.692
"ConsommÃ© flavored chips."

34:45.335 --> 34:48.047
See the present? Open it.

35:12.321 --> 35:14.156
It's your Note.

35:30.923 --> 35:33.217
Don't do like this.

35:37.972 --> 35:39.306
No...

35:56.198 --> 35:57.366
Ryuk.

36:02.872 --> 36:06.042
Long time no see, Misa.

36:11.088 --> 36:12.549
Is Light alive?

36:59.637 --> 37:00.847
Misa.

37:07.478 --> 37:09.856
Did that sound real?

37:10.648 --> 37:11.691
Who are you?

37:12.817 --> 37:14.694
I'm Shien.

37:15.653 --> 37:17.196
Kira's messenger.

37:19.490 --> 37:22.869
Give me 2 minutes and
I'll tell you his plan.

37:23.160 --> 37:25.204
We won't be disturbed.

37:25.663 --> 37:27.206
No one can see us.

37:39.093 --> 37:40.720
See the Kira video?

37:41.345 --> 37:44.724
I was behind that. Awesome, huh?

37:46.017 --> 37:49.395
I'll take on Kira's mission
and make it known.

37:50.187 --> 37:52.732
I'll spread it all over the world.

37:54.358 --> 37:55.902
Light's words...

37:57.862 --> 38:02.408
The video was on a chip that Ryuk gave me.

38:04.201 --> 38:05.244
You see.

38:06.203 --> 38:08.414
Light Yagami is alive.

38:13.878 --> 38:16.088
Gather all 6 Death Notes

38:16.213 --> 38:19.926
and Light will meet you at the place.

38:20.301 --> 38:23.429
Where he promised to meet you.

38:24.889 --> 38:26.432
The place...

38:27.559 --> 38:28.768
You know it.

38:29.519 --> 38:32.438
The place of his childhood memories.

38:36.400 --> 38:37.443
Right now.

38:38.235 --> 38:42.114
L's successor and his friends
want to stop us.

38:43.199 --> 38:48.454
We can only create Kira's new world
by defeating them.

38:49.246 --> 38:50.957
It's Light's wish.

38:53.000 --> 38:54.126
Misa.

38:55.753 --> 38:59.465
Where did he promise to meet you?

39:03.678 --> 39:04.804
Liar.

39:05.346 --> 39:06.723
Light's dead.

39:07.682 --> 39:13.395
If you're telling the truth,
you'd know where it is.

39:14.063 --> 39:19.736
He wants you to take me to
that place.

39:19.861 --> 39:21.904
So he didn't inform me.

39:25.032 --> 39:27.744
I'll get all the Death Notes.

39:28.870 --> 39:29.912
Together

39:31.038 --> 39:32.248
we'll meet Kira.

39:38.129 --> 39:41.007
Why would I believe your story?

39:43.050 --> 39:44.844
Don't you want to meet him?

39:48.806 --> 39:51.851
Get out.
Take the Death Note with you.

39:55.647 --> 39:58.190
That one belongs to you.

40:20.254 --> 40:23.382
Misa's leaving.
No irregularities.

41:24.777 --> 41:26.529
Hello, Dear.

41:28.656 --> 41:29.866
Hi-ya.

41:42.504 --> 41:45.590
Arma, I reclaim the Death Note.

41:51.137 --> 41:54.557
You always leave it when you go out.

41:55.182 --> 41:56.893
Why bother?

41:58.686 --> 42:03.482
I'd risk being seen by reaper's eyes.

42:04.358 --> 42:07.570
So much to think of.
What's your scheme?

42:22.251 --> 42:23.753
I can't say it on TV

42:23.878 --> 42:27.757
but we need a man like Kira to kill felons.

42:28.508 --> 42:33.095
The gap is growing between
the rich and the poor.

42:35.097 --> 42:37.934
To stop the poor from committing crimes

42:38.601 --> 42:40.770
we need a Kira.

42:43.565 --> 42:45.608
"Haruna Kiyokawa"

42:53.741 --> 42:54.951
Kira.

42:55.577 --> 42:57.954
You won't have the Death Notes.

43:10.091 --> 43:11.968
Haruna!

43:14.929 --> 43:17.306
Somebody, please help!

43:19.433 --> 43:21.978
According to her friends.

43:22.103 --> 43:26.816
Ms. Kiyokawa suddenly goaded
Kira and then died.

43:26.941 --> 43:29.068
Like she'd been hypnotized.

43:30.194 --> 43:35.491
She was an open supporter of Kira
on TV 10 years ago.

43:38.119 --> 43:39.662
She was killed

43:39.954 --> 43:43.666
by a Death Note holder
who opposes Neo Kira.

43:49.130 --> 43:52.842
Court is adjourned.

43:56.220 --> 43:58.515
"Expose Kira believers."

44:36.511 --> 44:39.388
You damn Kira believers...

44:41.223 --> 44:43.392
Death penalty for you.

44:52.527 --> 44:55.071
Leave it with my secretary.

44:56.698 --> 44:59.408
A delivery for Justice Mikuriya.

45:04.246 --> 45:07.041
"Justice Mikuriya, Death Note Holder."

45:12.797 --> 45:17.259
"Kenichi Mikuriya commits suicide..."

45:19.721 --> 45:23.432
I'm Kira's messenger.
Hand me the Death Note.

45:23.891 --> 45:25.768
Nonsense!

45:26.393 --> 45:30.272
You can't reverse what's
written in Death Note.

45:31.065 --> 45:33.776
You'll die as specified.

45:41.075 --> 45:45.412
Your Honor, Mr. Tomita is here.

45:45.913 --> 45:47.957
I'll be right there.

46:09.604 --> 46:11.147
OK, take it.

46:12.273 --> 46:13.482
Thanks.

46:17.612 --> 46:19.155
In exchange.

46:23.951 --> 46:25.077
Thanks.

46:46.641 --> 46:49.686
I'm Chief Justice Mikuriya.

46:51.563 --> 46:54.023
I'm here to see L's successor.

47:02.990 --> 47:03.990
Stop!

47:04.033 --> 47:05.284
Drop the knife!

47:13.167 --> 47:14.210
What do you want?

47:20.174 --> 47:21.551
Drop it!

47:23.052 --> 47:25.555
A message for L's successor.

47:27.056 --> 47:31.728
Kira has already eliminated
3 Death Note holders.

47:33.020 --> 47:34.396
Now

47:35.857 --> 47:38.568
it's the 4th holder's turn.

47:40.528 --> 47:42.238
Kira is God.

47:43.364 --> 47:44.907
Humans

47:46.534 --> 47:48.077
can not

47:50.538 --> 47:51.748
defy God.

48:16.480 --> 48:18.525
I'm checkmated...

48:22.570 --> 48:24.781
As if.

48:36.793 --> 48:38.795
Not bad, Shien.

48:40.421 --> 48:44.300
I'll quickly get all 6 Death Notes
so I can meet Kira.

48:52.266 --> 48:54.143
What are those scars?

48:57.438 --> 49:02.151
A man went berserk and massacred my family.

49:02.777 --> 49:05.487
Only I miraculously survived.

49:06.948 --> 49:10.660
And Kira eliminated the
killer 10 years ago?

49:10.785 --> 49:11.994
Yes.

49:13.454 --> 49:17.291
I'd lived in fear of the killer until then.

49:19.627 --> 49:24.674
Kira freed me from that hellish fear.

49:28.636 --> 49:30.012
Kira is.

49:30.471 --> 49:31.681
God!

49:36.227 --> 49:41.524
I have information on 2 more
Note holders killed by Neo Kira...

49:43.317 --> 49:46.988
Their identities were hacked and leaked.

49:47.279 --> 49:50.157
Alexey Ivanov, a Russian physician.

49:52.368 --> 49:56.372
Many of his patients died of heart failure.

49:57.665 --> 50:03.420
There were also many deaths
by suicidal Europeans.

50:03.880 --> 50:08.593
Then half a year ago, Ivanov
ODed and died.

50:09.511 --> 50:10.527
"Let me die please."

50:10.528 --> 50:15.032
He'd been looking at an online forum
for suicidal people.

50:16.518 --> 50:20.229
A broker called the Devil
of Wall Street had a Note.

50:21.355 --> 50:25.943
His clients mysteriously died when
stock went up.

50:26.903 --> 50:31.073
Then he jumped from the roof of
his building and died.

50:32.659 --> 50:36.704
No Death Note was found
in his office or the physician's.

50:39.248 --> 50:45.171
If Neo Kira took their Death Notes

50:45.547 --> 50:51.343
he might have 4 of the 6 Notes
reapers dropped on Earth.

50:52.094 --> 50:53.596
Oh, no...

50:54.388 --> 50:56.432
We only have one!

50:57.099 --> 50:58.935
I wouldn't worry.

50:59.852 --> 51:02.772
Who'll get all the Death Notes first?

51:04.231 --> 51:07.944
Kira released a media statement.

51:08.402 --> 51:12.281
Which might be related to Kira.

51:13.074 --> 51:17.537
Today a voice message
from someone claiming to be Kira

51:17.912 --> 51:21.624
was sent to us anonymously.

51:21.999 --> 51:24.794
We'll play the unedited version.

51:27.088 --> 51:28.965
Dear L's successor.

51:29.757 --> 51:31.759
You can't beat Kira.

51:33.595 --> 51:38.641
Don't interfere with the
creation of the new world order.

51:39.934 --> 51:45.481
Go on the Daily News Show
on December 17 on this channel.

51:45.690 --> 51:48.985
Reveal your name and face and do as I say.

51:50.027 --> 51:53.155
Or there'll be a bloodbath.

51:54.949 --> 52:00.496
Go on the Daily News Show
on December 17 on this channel.

52:00.622 --> 52:04.250
Reveal your name and face and do as I say.

52:06.127 --> 52:09.171
What's your move?
Looks like it's game over.

52:09.797 --> 52:12.675
Just when I'd begun to enjoy your world.

52:15.469 --> 52:17.514
What's to enjoy?

52:18.472 --> 52:22.519
I love these grapes and chatting with you.

52:24.311 --> 52:26.355
Don't you have friends?

52:27.148 --> 52:28.357
No.

52:30.151 --> 52:31.528
Just like you.

52:37.825 --> 52:39.536
We're not the same.

52:39.744 --> 52:41.370
You'll go on TV?

53:00.598 --> 53:02.058
Breaking news.

53:02.349 --> 53:04.727
After receiving the Kira message

53:05.019 --> 53:09.691
the commander of the Task
Force, L has responded.

53:10.775 --> 53:16.072
- Will Ryuzaki go on TV?
- He'd die. He knows better.

53:16.781 --> 53:18.908
Then there'll be bloodbath...

53:19.992 --> 53:21.744
What would L do...?

53:22.369 --> 53:23.705
I'm not L.

53:25.998 --> 53:27.584
Here's the message.

53:32.046 --> 53:33.255
It's L...!

53:40.888 --> 53:42.932
Hello, I'm L.

53:43.641 --> 53:46.435
How have you been, Light?

53:48.437 --> 53:51.440
Here I am as you asked of me.

53:52.567 --> 53:56.278
I admire your pursuit
of a peaceful new order

53:57.238 --> 53:59.782
but your methods are wrong.

53:59.949 --> 54:01.618
Bad CG.

54:01.743 --> 54:05.454
- They think I'm stupid.
- Don't waste lives.

54:06.413 --> 54:07.707
You're not God.

54:07.832 --> 54:09.291
That's L...

54:09.584 --> 54:11.794
Let's meet and discuss it.

54:11.919 --> 54:13.462
Ryuzaki.

54:14.421 --> 54:16.799
What's the big idea?

54:16.924 --> 54:19.636
Why risk death by going on live TV?

54:19.761 --> 54:21.804
L's already dead!

54:21.929 --> 54:26.809
Log in from this URL.
Your reaper's name is the password.

54:31.230 --> 54:32.649
Now the fun begins.

54:34.275 --> 54:37.486
- We can trace the traffic.
- To the booth.

54:38.946 --> 54:44.493
We'll monitor the DNS server to
track Kira and look for clues.

54:46.954 --> 54:47.997
Now...

54:49.456 --> 54:50.917
we'll wait.

54:54.461 --> 54:57.006
Hey, it's L!

54:57.799 --> 55:00.677
L's face isn't known to many.

55:01.052 --> 55:03.846
Even I couldn't access his image.

55:05.056 --> 55:06.849
It's CG but...

55:07.517 --> 55:11.688
only his successor could access L's image.

55:12.980 --> 55:14.356
What's next?

55:19.153 --> 55:20.863
I have an idea.

55:23.074 --> 55:24.074
"Log in."

55:27.954 --> 55:29.163
It's him!

55:29.288 --> 55:30.540
- Trace it.
- OK.

55:31.123 --> 55:32.709
"This is Kira."

55:36.754 --> 55:38.715
"You must like me!"

55:42.218 --> 55:46.388
"Don't be arrogant. Kira
is God, you can't win."

55:50.392 --> 55:52.895
"It's just reaper's power."

55:53.062 --> 55:55.565
Drag it out as long as you can.

55:59.443 --> 56:02.071
"Why not switch to voice?"

56:10.246 --> 56:11.247
"OK"

56:11.413 --> 56:12.414
Gotcha!

56:13.082 --> 56:14.584
"Audio on."

56:14.876 --> 56:15.876
On speaker.

56:20.757 --> 56:22.008
You hear me?

56:23.593 --> 56:24.761
Yes.

56:25.094 --> 56:26.763
- What the...?
- Is it him?

56:26.929 --> 56:28.765
It's filtered.

56:28.931 --> 56:31.433
- Or synthesized.
- Analyze the voice.

56:31.601 --> 56:34.937
I located him. He's in Metro Tokyo.

56:35.104 --> 56:36.105
Got him!

56:36.272 --> 56:38.107
Surround the area.

56:38.440 --> 56:39.609
We trapped him!

56:40.276 --> 56:41.443
Move it!

56:45.782 --> 56:48.325
We located Neo Kira.

56:48.618 --> 56:50.912
At a condo in Minato Ward.

56:51.162 --> 56:55.708
Request backup. Task Force
priority, capture subject.

56:55.958 --> 56:56.959
My goal?

56:58.460 --> 56:59.962
You know what I want.

57:03.633 --> 57:04.967
The Death Note?

57:05.467 --> 57:06.468
Yes.

57:06.636 --> 57:08.971
The one you have with you.

57:10.723 --> 57:15.061
Task Force K141, 2, 4 and
5 arriving at scene.

57:18.815 --> 57:22.652
- Kira's chatting with Ryuzaki.
- Mishima team, moving in.

57:30.660 --> 57:33.162
What if I don't give it to you?

57:33.746 --> 57:35.998
Tokyo will be piled with corpses.

57:36.833 --> 57:40.002
Innocent people will die in the streets.

57:40.294 --> 57:43.339
You'd do it even if I complied.

57:43.548 --> 57:45.174
You can't have it.

57:45.508 --> 57:47.635
I wouldn't hurt people.

57:53.516 --> 57:56.853
If Light is Neo Kira...

57:59.897 --> 58:01.190
I have to stop him.

58:04.276 --> 58:09.198
If I had all 6 Death Notes in this world

58:09.365 --> 58:11.367
I can bring peace.

58:12.034 --> 58:15.872
"Officers are at the scene."

58:43.733 --> 58:45.234
Tell me what to do.

58:47.904 --> 58:50.573
Deliver the Death Note to me

58:50.948 --> 58:52.199
alone.

58:52.784 --> 58:54.661
And if I don't?

58:55.620 --> 58:57.329
People will die.

58:58.623 --> 59:01.208
Including you, L's successor.

59:14.889 --> 59:16.182
Kira is God.

59:17.224 --> 59:18.851
Man loses.

59:19.310 --> 59:20.352
You'll see.

59:24.732 --> 59:27.359
What are you scheming?

59:30.112 --> 59:32.615
I received your message.

59:34.325 --> 59:36.536
From now on I'll only deal with you.

59:37.995 --> 59:40.497
We don't need other people.

59:49.632 --> 59:51.175
You found me!

59:55.179 --> 59:56.388
Light?

01:00:39.557 --> 01:00:41.267
"Tota Matsuda."

01:00:41.559 --> 01:00:42.935
"At 4 PM"

01:00:43.394 --> 01:00:46.438
"he enters the room, led by Kira"

01:00:46.564 --> 01:00:48.691
"then shoots himself"

01:00:48.900 --> 01:00:50.777
"with a smile."

01:01:01.412 --> 01:01:02.622
Matsuda...?

01:01:49.126 --> 01:01:50.336
I...

01:01:52.129 --> 01:01:54.841
I never told Matsuda my real name.

01:01:59.303 --> 01:02:00.847
Damn Kira!

01:02:01.973 --> 01:02:03.683
- When my brother...
- Don't.

01:02:09.689 --> 01:02:12.358
We remain anonymous.

01:02:13.818 --> 01:02:15.361
That's our rule.

01:02:16.821 --> 01:02:18.364
I know...

01:02:19.657 --> 01:02:21.534
Being anonymous

01:02:22.660 --> 01:02:27.373
protects you in the Death
Note investigation.

01:02:30.334 --> 01:02:31.544
It's a must.

01:02:37.925 --> 01:02:39.969
When the Notes are contained.

01:02:43.681 --> 01:02:46.058
I want to call you
by your real name.

01:02:48.686 --> 01:02:51.063
We will secure the Death Notes.

01:03:13.628 --> 01:03:15.755
You failed big time.

01:03:16.714 --> 01:03:21.678
I'll supervise the Death Note
investigation from now on.

01:03:22.219 --> 01:03:25.431
The Task Force is decommissioned.

01:03:25.723 --> 01:03:26.766
But...

01:03:27.058 --> 01:03:29.727
It's out of your hands, officers.

01:03:29.894 --> 01:03:30.970
Wait.

01:03:30.995 --> 01:03:34.040
A Death Note can manipulate people.

01:03:34.398 --> 01:03:38.444
What if I blew myself
up and killed you all!

01:03:38.570 --> 01:03:39.779
It won't happen.

01:03:39.904 --> 01:03:43.783
The Death Note rules dictate
that deaths are one on one.

01:03:43.908 --> 01:03:45.034
Who cares!

01:03:45.743 --> 01:03:47.119
Forget the rules!

01:03:49.246 --> 01:03:53.459
In the interests of national security
we'll get the Notes.

01:03:53.585 --> 01:03:55.127
What do you mean?

01:03:55.336 --> 01:03:56.879
That's confidential.

01:03:58.255 --> 01:03:59.465
Shut this down!

01:03:59.757 --> 01:04:00.757
Come on.

01:04:04.596 --> 01:04:05.805
Captain.

01:04:06.598 --> 01:04:07.807
Sugawara!

01:04:19.401 --> 01:04:21.988
You mourn when one man dies but

01:04:22.947 --> 01:04:25.825
when many die, it's just a toll.

01:04:37.294 --> 01:04:38.505
Bastard!

01:04:40.632 --> 01:04:43.593
Come on, punch me in the face!

01:04:44.260 --> 01:04:46.178
Come on!

01:04:46.303 --> 01:04:47.847
Sissy!

01:04:47.972 --> 01:04:50.182
Calm down, guys.

01:04:56.773 --> 01:04:58.691
Let me say this.

01:05:01.819 --> 01:05:06.198
I'm a P.I. so they can't
take me off the case.

01:05:10.286 --> 01:05:12.204
I'll finish the game.

01:05:35.144 --> 01:05:37.564
I received your message.

01:06:38.124 --> 01:06:39.834
I'm home.

01:06:40.001 --> 01:06:41.043
Hi, Dear.

01:06:41.210 --> 01:06:42.504
Hi.

01:06:53.640 --> 01:06:54.690
Ouch!

01:06:54.716 --> 01:06:56.092
A reaper...

01:06:59.353 --> 01:07:01.063
You own a Death Note.

01:07:01.188 --> 01:07:04.901
- How did you know?
- You told me you'd finish the game.

01:07:05.359 --> 01:07:08.571
You can only do that with all 6 Notes.

01:07:09.030 --> 01:07:13.075
The police have 1.
Kira probably has 4.

01:07:13.367 --> 01:07:18.414
You can only finish the game
if you have the last Death Note.

01:07:20.207 --> 01:07:21.207
Really?

01:07:21.375 --> 01:07:25.046
Your L video was an
encrypted message to Kira.

01:07:26.380 --> 01:07:30.259
I decoded it and it said
"I own the last Death Note."

01:07:30.718 --> 01:07:31.928
What's your plan?

01:07:33.888 --> 01:07:34.931
Plan?

01:07:35.056 --> 01:07:36.432
Show me the Note.

01:08:10.758 --> 01:08:12.802
He hasn't used the Note.

01:08:13.427 --> 01:08:17.389
Torn out pages from the
Note work just fine.

01:08:17.599 --> 01:08:19.809
It proves nothing.

01:08:20.434 --> 01:08:24.313
I promised L that I wouldn't
use the Death Note.

01:08:25.272 --> 01:08:30.361
I wrote his own name in the Note
to trap and expose Kira.

01:08:31.112 --> 01:08:33.488
Matsuda told me that.

01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:38.995
You can only be named in
a Death Note one time.

01:08:39.537 --> 01:08:43.374
I sacrificed his life to trap Kira
with that loophole.

01:08:44.125 --> 01:08:46.002
I regretted it.

01:08:46.794 --> 01:08:52.133
He thought that the Death Note
turned him into a criminal.

01:08:54.886 --> 01:08:57.514
So I made a promise to L.

01:08:59.140 --> 01:09:03.853
That I wouldn't rely on the Death Note
to solve the case.

01:09:14.531 --> 01:09:16.658
I will die soon.

01:09:18.367 --> 01:09:19.618
Promise me.

01:09:20.118 --> 01:09:24.331
Even if you had a power,
like the Death Note

01:09:24.456 --> 01:09:28.044
you won't fight evil with evil means.

01:09:29.629 --> 01:09:32.048
Have a good life.

01:09:38.011 --> 01:09:40.890
I can't surpass L if I used the Note!

01:09:43.685 --> 01:09:46.062
You expect me to believe that.

01:09:48.354 --> 01:09:50.983
I allowed you to live.

01:09:51.149 --> 01:09:52.149
What?

01:09:52.318 --> 01:09:55.237
Arma is a loyal friend.

01:09:55.697 --> 01:09:58.240
She'd kill you to protect me.

01:09:58.700 --> 01:09:59.909
Maybe.

01:10:02.286 --> 01:10:04.914
But I will not use Death Note.

01:10:11.879 --> 01:10:15.758
Neo Kira won't stop at
getting all the Notes.

01:10:16.884 --> 01:10:21.222
We'll lure him with our Notes
and take his 4 Notes...

01:10:25.727 --> 01:10:27.604
and secure all 6.

01:10:28.020 --> 01:10:33.442
For him to do that he needs the Note
that the police have.

01:10:33.735 --> 01:10:36.112
I'll do it at noon tomorrow.

01:10:53.337 --> 01:10:55.464
I trust L's DNA.

01:11:16.694 --> 01:11:17.987
Police.

01:11:18.195 --> 01:11:23.409
Lieutenant Mishima, you're a
person of interest. Come with us.

01:11:23.785 --> 01:11:25.828
A person of interest?

01:11:41.553 --> 01:11:44.388
Am I a loyal friend?

01:11:45.056 --> 01:11:47.183
I was bullshitting.

01:11:48.643 --> 01:11:53.189
You can kill a human to
extend another's life.

01:11:55.399 --> 01:11:57.527
But you pay with your life.

01:11:58.611 --> 01:12:00.655
You wouldn't have to do that.

01:12:01.322 --> 01:12:02.406
Maybe.

01:12:17.171 --> 01:12:19.381
What's this, Captain?

01:12:19.674 --> 01:12:22.051
As a security measure against Kira

01:12:22.510 --> 01:12:25.054
we scrutinized all servers and PCs.

01:12:25.179 --> 01:12:26.222
And?

01:12:27.056 --> 01:12:31.393
We found the virus and
some old hidden files.

01:12:32.186 --> 01:12:34.731
We found out an incredible fact.

01:12:35.607 --> 01:12:38.400
Light Yagami's DNA lives on.

01:12:39.861 --> 01:12:42.071
His child lived in the USA.

01:12:43.030 --> 01:12:48.745
He was brought back here and
raised by Misa's prosecutor.

01:12:49.871 --> 01:12:51.080
Mikami.

01:12:55.877 --> 01:12:57.086
Impossible...!

01:12:57.545 --> 01:12:58.545
Nice acting.

01:12:59.714 --> 01:13:05.261
You must have known
and chosen not to report it.

01:13:05.427 --> 01:13:09.265
I reported everything.
I didn't hide it.

01:13:11.726 --> 01:13:12.734
You did.

01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:14.303
I was framed!

01:13:14.395 --> 01:13:18.274
You're hiding your connection to Neo Kira.

01:13:21.235 --> 01:13:24.488
You'll be confined until you talk.

01:13:49.430 --> 01:13:52.141
"I'll get all the Death Notes."

01:13:52.474 --> 01:13:56.395
"Bring your Note to Tokyo
City Hall at 2PM tomorrow."

01:13:57.146 --> 01:13:59.356
"We'll defeat L's successor."

01:14:04.111 --> 01:14:06.322
I'm afraid she won't come.

01:14:07.281 --> 01:14:09.325
Misa Amane will come.

01:14:09.867 --> 01:14:12.662
How can you be so sure of yourself?

01:14:14.121 --> 01:14:15.331
I just know.

01:14:17.458 --> 01:14:19.335
She and I are similar.

01:14:21.337 --> 01:14:24.173
Now we'll wait for a response.

01:14:25.758 --> 01:14:27.677
It's show time.

01:14:50.825 --> 01:14:51.868
Mishima?

01:14:53.494 --> 01:14:55.037
Mishima!

01:14:56.497 --> 01:14:58.415
Mishima.

01:15:02.336 --> 01:15:03.880
You framed me!

01:15:18.435 --> 01:15:19.435
Come on.

01:15:30.031 --> 01:15:31.908
There are cameras.

01:15:32.033 --> 01:15:36.579
Never mind. I learned a trick from our foe.

01:15:36.871 --> 01:15:38.414
We won't be seen.

01:15:39.791 --> 01:15:41.083
Give me the Note.

01:16:15.910 --> 01:16:17.161
In the case.

01:16:57.952 --> 01:17:01.330
- What's your plan?
- I'll contact Neo Kira.

01:17:05.627 --> 01:17:07.003
I see.

01:17:08.963 --> 01:17:14.176
Death Notes are objects so
they can't be sent by cyberspace.

01:17:14.636 --> 01:17:19.181
They must be handed over in person
which will be my chance.

01:17:21.142 --> 01:17:23.853
Maybe you want to keep all 6.

01:17:44.331 --> 01:17:46.208
It's Matsuda's gun.

01:17:56.343 --> 01:17:58.721
- What for...?
- Shoot me.

01:18:03.267 --> 01:18:06.145
Shoot if you can't trust me!

01:18:10.692 --> 01:18:13.736
I said I might put you to use.

01:18:26.999 --> 01:18:28.918
For your new place.

01:18:30.878 --> 01:18:32.922
He'll come.

01:18:34.966 --> 01:18:36.593
Watch him.

01:18:53.109 --> 01:18:55.361
I'll watch you too.

01:19:48.790 --> 01:19:52.960
Ryuzaki and Mishima ran
off with vital evidence.

01:19:53.628 --> 01:19:56.422
Set up dragnet across Metro Tokyo.

01:19:57.381 --> 01:19:58.925
You read me?

01:20:00.467 --> 01:20:03.345
You really have 2 Death Notes with you?

01:20:03.971 --> 01:20:05.682
There you are.

01:20:11.145 --> 01:20:15.024
First we'll need to confirm
that all Death Notes

01:20:15.232 --> 01:20:17.193
are real.

01:20:17.985 --> 01:20:20.362
Wait for instructions.

01:20:29.997 --> 01:20:33.375
Lieutenant Mishima, you're under arrest.

01:20:42.844 --> 01:20:44.220
Just kidding.

01:20:47.181 --> 01:20:50.059
Guys... why are you here?

01:20:51.060 --> 01:20:52.394
Ryuzaki told us.

01:20:56.357 --> 01:20:57.734
Ryuzaki...

01:20:58.610 --> 01:21:01.237
Brief us on the situation.

01:21:04.699 --> 01:21:07.243
1PM, at Higashi Okawamon Station.

01:21:08.953 --> 01:21:10.079
Roger.

01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:18.087
We'll grab our chance when Ryuzaki
and Kira meet with the 6 Death Notes.

01:21:18.546 --> 01:21:21.924
We'll secure and seal
the Death Notes.

01:21:23.551 --> 01:21:24.927
Will you help me?

01:21:26.846 --> 01:21:30.057
- Definitely.
- For Matsuda.

01:21:30.892 --> 01:21:34.103
- Cover us. We'll follow Ryuzaki.
- OK.

01:21:34.395 --> 01:21:35.772
A piece of cake.

01:21:44.906 --> 01:21:45.990
Let's go.

01:21:50.787 --> 01:21:55.583
Ryuzaki and Mishima remain at large.
Extend the dragnet.

01:22:01.172 --> 01:22:03.716
Ryuzaki, this is Mishima, over.

01:22:04.258 --> 01:22:05.552
I copy you.

01:22:06.093 --> 01:22:08.429
Kuromoto and Uragami will back you up.

01:22:08.680 --> 01:22:11.599
Send them to Higashi Okawamon Station.

01:22:11.766 --> 01:22:12.766
Roger.

01:22:12.850 --> 01:22:14.561
Kuromoto, Uragami?

01:22:14.811 --> 01:22:17.146
Kuromoto here, on watch.

01:22:23.152 --> 01:22:27.657
We'll put Death Note pages
at certain locations.

01:22:28.115 --> 01:22:32.328
Place yours in â™ª7 locker by the west exit.

01:22:32.579 --> 01:22:34.997
Put the key in the bag.

01:22:48.803 --> 01:22:51.388
In the locker, as instructed.

01:22:51.681 --> 01:22:55.184
Mine's on the side of
the bench at the plaza.

01:22:56.978 --> 01:23:00.022
Surveillance videos weren't hacked.

01:23:00.314 --> 01:23:01.314
Roger.

01:23:02.149 --> 01:23:05.361
Kuromoto here. We're tailing Ryuzaki.

01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:13.369
Any sign of hacking?

01:23:15.079 --> 01:23:19.375
I'm at the site. There're no
suspicious transmissions.

01:24:00.875 --> 01:24:04.420
Hey, Successor!
Are we having fun yet?

01:24:10.217 --> 01:24:12.428
So you're Ryuk.

01:24:15.723 --> 01:24:18.601
Have fun while it lasts.

01:24:19.727 --> 01:24:24.607
I'll spoil your fun, the same way L did!

01:24:25.733 --> 01:24:28.110
Just like L, right?

01:25:00.852 --> 01:25:01.853
Hi.

01:25:07.108 --> 01:25:08.651
I confirmed it.

01:25:10.945 --> 01:25:12.488
Now what?

01:25:12.822 --> 01:25:15.658
Tokyo City Hall, 2:30 PM.

01:25:15.783 --> 01:25:17.326
Show your face.

01:25:17.869 --> 01:25:19.996
I'll show mine too.

01:26:01.162 --> 01:26:03.205
Go! Keep your eye on him!

01:26:12.048 --> 01:26:15.552
Cover your face until we
confirm it's Neo Kira.

01:26:16.511 --> 01:26:18.054
Affirmative.

01:26:31.025 --> 01:26:33.736
Nanase outside the Hall.

01:26:34.278 --> 01:26:35.404
Copy.

01:27:06.728 --> 01:27:09.939
Ryuzaki, police surveillance is down!

01:27:11.733 --> 01:27:13.109
You copy?

01:27:14.401 --> 01:27:15.612
Ryuzaki?

01:27:26.914 --> 01:27:28.791
Nanase, come in.

01:27:34.088 --> 01:27:36.298
Kuromoto? You read me?

01:27:36.465 --> 01:27:38.467
- Nanase here.
- Talk to me!

01:27:38.593 --> 01:27:41.638
It's jammed.
I can't make contact.

01:27:43.931 --> 01:27:47.143
Our servers are down.
And the surveillance videos.

01:27:47.434 --> 01:27:49.145
I'll locate the jammer.

01:27:49.270 --> 01:27:51.814
Watch out, Neo Kira is nearby.

01:28:08.706 --> 01:28:09.832
I am Kira.

01:28:10.374 --> 01:28:13.335
Kira is God. Humans can't win.

01:28:13.795 --> 01:28:18.508
- Damn!
- Kira is God. Humans can't win.

01:28:18.966 --> 01:28:20.176
I am Kira.

01:28:20.635 --> 01:28:23.680
Kira is God. Humans can't win.

01:28:24.471 --> 01:28:27.141
Mishima, it's time. I'm ready.

01:28:56.337 --> 01:28:57.547
I am Kira.

01:28:58.005 --> 01:29:01.133
Kira is God. Humans can't win.

01:29:01.509 --> 01:29:02.885
I am Kira.

01:29:03.177 --> 01:29:06.472
Kira is God. Humans can't win.

01:29:06.806 --> 01:29:10.810
The Metro PD servers were hijacked!
Nanase, come in!

01:30:00.401 --> 01:30:02.278
- We're back!
- Do you copy?

01:30:02.403 --> 01:30:04.280
Yes! Ryuzaki?

01:30:20.087 --> 01:30:21.097
Ryuzaki?

01:30:21.122 --> 01:30:23.833
"Masayuki Arai, sudden death."

01:30:31.599 --> 01:30:33.309
Ryuzaki!

01:30:43.277 --> 01:30:45.487
It's Misa Amane!

01:30:53.705 --> 01:30:55.331
To the place.

01:31:04.632 --> 01:31:06.342
Light no longer exists.

01:31:09.136 --> 01:31:12.098
I saw his photo with
reaper's eyes, so I know.

01:31:19.480 --> 01:31:22.692
When a Death Note user dies he's nullified.

01:31:23.651 --> 01:31:24.694
But you...

01:31:25.820 --> 01:31:27.780
received Light's message.

01:31:29.490 --> 01:31:31.534
Carry on his message.

01:31:34.495 --> 01:31:37.206
The penthouse at Mount Kora hotel.

01:31:37.832 --> 01:31:38.832
Go.

01:31:41.210 --> 01:31:42.211
Move!

01:31:43.588 --> 01:31:44.631
Out of the way!

01:31:48.342 --> 01:31:49.385
Go on.

01:31:58.019 --> 01:31:59.228
Move!

01:32:01.063 --> 01:32:02.314
Out of the way!

01:32:03.357 --> 01:32:04.567
Move it!

01:32:28.591 --> 01:32:31.093
Neo Kira's headed for Mount Kora!

01:32:31.343 --> 01:32:33.596
Kuromoto and Uragami are down!

01:32:34.556 --> 01:32:35.932
Damn!

01:33:33.322 --> 01:33:35.992
"Misa Amane."

01:33:36.117 --> 01:33:41.413
"Dies in Light Yagami's arms
at 2:40PM, December 18."

01:36:59.571 --> 01:37:00.697
Ryuk.

01:37:03.825 --> 01:37:05.702
Who owns this now?

01:37:06.327 --> 01:37:07.870
You do.

01:37:08.663 --> 01:37:10.873
Because Misa died.

01:37:14.001 --> 01:37:16.546
I'll trade it for reaper's eyes.

01:37:17.672 --> 01:37:19.381
What for?

01:37:23.010 --> 01:37:24.470
To kill Kira.

01:37:27.014 --> 01:37:28.057
Seriously?

01:37:29.016 --> 01:37:32.061
For me and Misa, Light is Kira.

01:37:33.187 --> 01:37:36.065
Neo Kira is a different person.

01:37:36.524 --> 01:37:41.070
He controls me with fear.
I'll take my chances and kill him.

01:37:43.030 --> 01:37:44.073
Then

01:37:44.866 --> 01:37:46.909
I'll succeed Kira.

01:37:47.702 --> 01:37:48.911
Interesting.

01:37:49.370 --> 01:37:52.248
You really want to seal the deal?

01:37:54.208 --> 01:37:56.085
Absolutely.

01:38:09.390 --> 01:38:11.267
Now the fun begins.

01:38:19.567 --> 01:38:20.610
Come on.

01:38:21.903 --> 01:38:23.613
Show yourself.

01:38:25.740 --> 01:38:26.783
Kira!

01:38:57.605 --> 01:38:59.315
So you're Kira?

01:39:08.866 --> 01:39:10.492
Give me the Notes.

01:39:12.954 --> 01:39:14.330
No way.

01:39:27.301 --> 01:39:30.930
You have no authority to shoot to kill!

01:39:31.889 --> 01:39:33.015
Ryuzaki...?

01:39:39.480 --> 01:39:40.898
I am Kira.

01:39:44.986 --> 01:39:47.321
"Masayuki Arai, sudden death."

01:39:57.414 --> 01:39:58.457
You didn't die.

01:39:58.833 --> 01:40:03.129
That's not a real Death Note.
Hands on your head.

01:40:15.224 --> 01:40:17.810
Explain, Ryuzaki.

01:40:18.185 --> 01:40:19.646
This is real.

01:40:22.106 --> 01:40:25.985
I can't be killed by Death Notes.
Guess why.

01:40:29.656 --> 01:40:32.491
Your name's in another Death Note?

01:40:33.535 --> 01:40:35.327
With a future date.

01:40:35.620 --> 01:40:36.996
Exactly.

01:40:38.790 --> 01:40:42.001
Before he met Misa, Ryuk gave it away.

01:40:42.710 --> 01:40:45.004
Just like L, right?

01:40:49.300 --> 01:40:50.301
Oops!

01:40:50.718 --> 01:40:52.929
I'll die the same way as L.

01:40:53.888 --> 01:40:59.435
It means someone wrote
my name in another Death Note.

01:40:59.977 --> 01:41:01.604
Meaning.

01:41:02.313 --> 01:41:04.566
I can't be killed by Death Notes.

01:41:05.191 --> 01:41:07.860
Who wrote your name then?

01:41:08.402 --> 01:41:11.447
Not him. He tried to kill me.

01:41:13.575 --> 01:41:15.785
He is not Neo Kira.

01:41:17.411 --> 01:41:21.791
I pretended to die to find out who he is.

01:41:24.919 --> 01:41:28.881
The question is who's the real Neo Kira?

01:41:30.800 --> 01:41:33.135
You're right, it's not me.

01:41:34.345 --> 01:41:39.141
10 years ago, Light produced a heir.

01:41:39.517 --> 01:41:42.645
The child and I were left a message.

01:41:42.937 --> 01:41:46.315
- Maybe it's his kid?
- It's a trick!

01:41:46.440 --> 01:41:48.150
Ryuk told me.

01:41:49.026 --> 01:41:52.321
Light took precautions just in case.

01:41:52.446 --> 01:41:56.826
He kept the child's
existence from the police.

01:41:57.785 --> 01:42:01.664
If the child exists he'd be 9.

01:42:03.124 --> 01:42:05.001
He'd have a guardian.

01:42:06.961 --> 01:42:08.170
Mishima.

01:42:10.464 --> 01:42:12.842
Who could the guardian be?

01:42:15.052 --> 01:42:19.348
Is it Mikami, the prosecutor
Misa had 10 years ago?

01:42:21.643 --> 01:42:23.853
He disappeared a year ago

01:42:24.812 --> 01:42:26.355
right here.

01:42:27.148 --> 01:42:30.860
You investigated his disappearance.

01:42:33.154 --> 01:42:36.032
I found no trace of Mikami.

01:42:40.077 --> 01:42:42.371
You must have learned something.

01:42:43.497 --> 01:42:44.707
No, I...

01:42:44.832 --> 01:42:46.793
Yes, you did.

01:42:47.001 --> 01:42:48.795
It's his trap.

01:42:49.504 --> 01:42:51.714
I think you've forgotten.

01:42:51.923 --> 01:42:54.050
I remember everything.

01:42:54.592 --> 01:42:57.303
Maybe your memory was erased.

01:43:04.018 --> 01:43:07.396
Maybe you gave up the
ownership of a Death Note.

01:43:13.528 --> 01:43:15.071
How ridiculous...

01:43:22.537 --> 01:43:24.246
So you're Kira?

01:43:28.084 --> 01:43:29.919
That's not funny...

01:43:34.048 --> 01:43:35.257
Touch it.

01:44:09.416 --> 01:44:11.043
Nothing happens!

01:44:11.210 --> 01:44:12.754
I'm not Kira!

01:45:25.660 --> 01:45:28.663
I gave the child a Death Note.

01:45:30.331 --> 01:45:32.709
He'd be the successor.

01:45:33.835 --> 01:45:36.713
But they both lost their minds.

01:45:38.506 --> 01:45:41.843
It's your Death Note now.

01:45:53.521 --> 01:45:55.565
If you're watching this.

01:45:56.524 --> 01:45:57.942
It means I'm dead.

01:46:02.530 --> 01:46:04.156
To bring peace to the world.

01:46:05.032 --> 01:46:07.243
I eliminated fools.

01:46:08.870 --> 01:46:09.912
People

01:46:10.371 --> 01:46:14.751
called the savior Kira and worshiped him.

01:46:15.543 --> 01:46:19.589
Light killed felons and reduced crime.

01:46:20.214 --> 01:46:21.591
Live as Kira.

01:46:24.511 --> 01:46:26.095
Kira is justice...

01:46:28.222 --> 01:46:30.933
You'll do what Light did?

01:46:35.021 --> 01:46:37.940
I'll stop wars, not just crimes.

01:46:38.399 --> 01:46:43.613
Ryuk, find a cyberterrorist
so I can negotiate with countries.

01:46:44.196 --> 01:46:47.199
The so-called Pacifist Hacker.

01:46:47.575 --> 01:46:48.951
Criminals dead!

01:46:49.076 --> 01:46:51.788
The suspected killer is dead.

01:46:51.913 --> 01:46:55.124
It echoes the Kira case 10 years ago...

01:46:55.416 --> 01:46:57.960
The world is becoming peaceful.

01:46:58.586 --> 01:47:02.214
L's successor is joining
the investigation...

01:47:02.924 --> 01:47:04.967
That's trouble.

01:47:05.259 --> 01:47:08.137
How about using reaper's eyes?

01:47:08.846 --> 01:47:10.472
Reaper's eyes...

01:47:15.562 --> 01:47:19.606
I need a comrade who shares Kira's ideals.

01:47:19.607 --> 01:47:22.067
"Masayuki Arai heart attack."

01:47:22.068 --> 01:47:24.486
You're right, I am...

01:47:25.112 --> 01:47:26.112
Kira.

01:47:29.784 --> 01:47:30.993
I am

01:47:32.119 --> 01:47:33.119
Kira.

01:47:35.164 --> 01:47:36.999
I dispossess my Note.

01:47:38.751 --> 01:47:43.339
Give the Death Note and Light's
message to the cyberterrorist.

01:47:45.007 --> 01:47:46.509
I will.

01:48:20.585 --> 01:48:23.379
How have you been, Mishima?

01:48:24.589 --> 01:48:26.048
Ryuk...

01:48:32.054 --> 01:48:35.725
I knew you were Kira!

01:48:43.691 --> 01:48:45.067
It's you...

01:49:08.382 --> 01:49:11.427
Say something, Mishima.

01:49:12.720 --> 01:49:14.931
It all turned out as planned.

01:49:31.238 --> 01:49:36.410
"Ryo Nakagami."

01:50:24.751 --> 01:50:28.546
Mishima, Ryuzaki and an
unknown man are Kira.

01:50:28.713 --> 01:50:33.175
These terrorists have weapons
of mass destruction.

01:50:33.801 --> 01:50:37.179
We're in a state of emergency.

01:50:37.972 --> 01:50:42.351
Shoot to kill.
Secure the Death Notes.

01:50:43.310 --> 01:50:45.354
Kill them all.

01:50:45.647 --> 01:50:47.690
They know my name and face.

01:50:49.651 --> 01:50:51.360
They're special units.

01:50:54.947 --> 01:50:57.534
The government wants the Death Notes.

01:51:32.860 --> 01:51:33.936
Ryuk.

01:51:33.961 --> 01:51:35.171
Yes?

01:51:35.362 --> 01:51:36.906
Let's play the game.

01:51:38.282 --> 01:51:39.325
If we must!

01:51:39.867 --> 01:51:42.078
"Sudden death."

01:51:56.926 --> 01:51:58.678
Who's doing this?

01:52:24.078 --> 01:52:26.789
Hide your face! Hide your face!

01:52:27.790 --> 01:52:29.626
Kira is God.

01:52:30.585 --> 01:52:32.253
Humans can't win!

01:52:35.590 --> 01:52:38.134
The notebook has no chance
against guns!

01:53:08.873 --> 01:53:10.124
Let's get out!

01:53:12.293 --> 01:53:13.670
I'm dying...

01:53:17.298 --> 01:53:19.341
I'll stay here.

01:53:29.393 --> 01:53:31.771
I can't let them have the Note.

01:53:54.251 --> 01:53:56.045
Go.

01:53:59.173 --> 01:54:00.883
Go.

01:54:04.178 --> 01:54:05.387
Come on.

01:54:56.147 --> 01:54:59.609
I thought you were going to
kill Kira.

01:55:01.402 --> 01:55:03.613
Aren't humans funny?

01:56:19.438 --> 01:56:21.691
Why did you become Kira?

01:56:22.900 --> 01:56:24.360
I had no choice!

01:56:25.486 --> 01:56:29.866
That was the only way to stop
the search for the next Kira.

01:56:30.157 --> 01:56:33.035
Otherwise more people would have died.

01:56:33.828 --> 01:56:36.038
World peace was so close!

01:56:36.205 --> 01:56:37.874
That's an excuse!

01:56:40.334 --> 01:56:43.880
You let the reaper trick you into it.

01:56:47.008 --> 01:56:49.051
Death Notes make you crazy.

01:56:50.094 --> 01:56:52.054
You justify your actions

01:56:52.930 --> 01:56:55.391
and kill to protect yourself.

01:56:56.684 --> 01:56:58.895
I call that criminal.

01:57:17.329 --> 01:57:19.165
Over here, Mishima!

01:57:20.708 --> 01:57:22.251
Nanase.

01:57:28.299 --> 01:57:32.762
It's OK. Interpol wants to lift
the order to kill you.

01:57:55.409 --> 01:57:57.119
Ayana Shirato.

01:58:01.248 --> 01:58:03.125
That's my name.

01:58:05.920 --> 01:58:10.132
I told you I'd tell you my name
when it's over...

01:58:13.010 --> 01:58:14.136
Kira.

01:58:21.185 --> 01:58:24.313
You wrote my brother's name
in a Death Note.

01:58:25.773 --> 01:58:27.984
He was a criminal but

01:58:29.110 --> 01:58:31.487
he was my only family!

01:58:33.114 --> 01:58:34.156
Put it down.

01:58:34.323 --> 01:58:35.950
- Don't!
- Goodbye.

01:58:41.330 --> 01:58:42.665
Ryuzaki...

01:58:48.630 --> 01:58:49.797
Don't shoot.

01:59:00.642 --> 01:59:01.851
Go ahead.

01:59:11.277 --> 01:59:13.320
No. Don't...

02:00:01.994 --> 02:00:05.915
You called me a loyal friend.
Right?

02:00:09.919 --> 02:00:12.088
Why did you...?

02:00:13.130 --> 02:00:16.092
I wanted to protect
what's important to you.

02:00:17.259 --> 02:00:18.928
Goodbye.

02:00:19.220 --> 02:00:20.429
Arma.

02:00:20.888 --> 02:00:21.931
Arma!

02:00:27.520 --> 02:00:29.772
You, idiot!

02:01:38.465 --> 02:01:43.304
I'll tell you why we're looking
so hard for the next Kira.

02:01:47.474 --> 02:01:52.021
The King promised that
anyone who found the next Kira

02:01:52.146 --> 02:01:56.025
would have the throne after he retired.

02:01:56.442 --> 02:01:58.861
So until there's the next Kira

02:01:59.070 --> 02:02:03.365
the game continues, we'll drop
the Death Notes in your world.

02:02:04.491 --> 02:02:08.037
You're wrong. It's game over.

02:02:09.330 --> 02:02:12.041
The 6 Death Notes will be locked away.

02:02:12.959 --> 02:02:15.545
The 7th won't have any power.

02:02:17.714 --> 02:02:19.549
That's the rule.

02:02:20.717 --> 02:02:22.719
That's the rule...

02:02:23.344 --> 02:02:25.722
But being endlessly greedy

02:02:25.847 --> 02:02:30.059
some humans will break the vault
to get the Death Notes.

02:02:33.395 --> 02:02:37.399
That means the fun never ends for me!

02:02:42.029 --> 02:02:44.907
Adios, Mishima.

02:03:29.451 --> 02:03:30.953
You look good.

02:03:39.461 --> 02:03:42.965
You wrote in Death Note that I'd die today.

02:03:44.592 --> 02:03:45.968
It's that time...

02:03:49.764 --> 02:03:51.473
Why did you protect me?

02:03:54.644 --> 02:03:55.978
I don't know...

02:04:04.779 --> 02:04:09.617
You were the only Death Note holder
who stayed sane.

02:04:38.479 --> 02:04:42.024
The Japanese Government seized
the 6 Death Notes.

02:04:42.483 --> 02:04:47.530
Then Interpol assigned them to
a neutral organization.

02:04:48.823 --> 02:04:50.366
But terrorists

02:04:51.367 --> 02:04:54.370
seized the vehicle carrying the Notes.

02:04:56.706 --> 02:05:00.042
4 out of 6 Death Notes went up in flames.

02:05:02.211 --> 02:05:03.880
They weren't contained.

02:05:07.925 --> 02:05:10.887
There's been Death Note homicides.

02:05:29.030 --> 02:05:32.074
Use it instead of a Death Note.

02:05:34.702 --> 02:05:35.778
What do you mean?

02:05:35.803 --> 02:05:37.513
I'll release you.

02:05:38.706 --> 02:05:40.583
I'm above the law.

02:05:43.127 --> 02:05:46.422
You're Ryuzaki now.
I'll die as Mishima.

02:05:48.049 --> 02:05:52.261
Legally you don't exist so you can
work on the Death Note case.

02:05:52.887 --> 02:05:54.346
I'm not qualified.

02:05:58.225 --> 02:05:59.769
But I'm dying.

02:06:04.398 --> 02:06:05.942
There's only you.

02:06:19.246 --> 02:06:20.623
Go.

02:06:28.590 --> 02:06:29.966
Adios, Mishima.

02:06:32.259 --> 02:06:33.636
I'm not Mishima.

02:06:40.184 --> 02:06:41.644
Ryo Nakagami.

02:06:42.687 --> 02:06:44.480
That's my real name.

02:06:56.283 --> 02:06:58.494
Our names are so ordinary.

02:14:31.280 --> 02:14:33.074
Just as I planned.
