01:06.651 --> 01:09.195
This van is kind
of weirding me out.

01:09.279 --> 01:11.239
This van and the weed
is freaking me out.

01:11.322 --> 01:12.449
I feel like I'm
on another planet.

01:12.532 --> 01:13.867
I don't know,
I like Marty's van.

01:13.950 --> 01:16.703
You know, it's like
a cozy cocaine mansion.

01:17.704 --> 01:19.789
You know I met this
dude like five times?

01:19.873 --> 01:21.624
Marty still does not
remember my name.

01:21.708 --> 01:23.084
Yeah, where'd you
find that guy?

01:23.168 --> 01:26.212
He manages the casino
where I won
the pai-gow tournament.

01:27.505 --> 01:28.715
Pai-gow.

01:28.798 --> 01:30.592
Hold on.
Pai-gow.

01:30.675 --> 01:32.035
Tracy's coming to
pick us up, so...

01:32.051 --> 01:33.303
Hold on a second.

01:33.386 --> 01:35.722
Did you just
invite your fiancÃ©e
to your bachelor party?

01:35.930 --> 01:37.390
Is that the
cool thing to do?
No.

01:37.474 --> 01:38.475
Did we just witness that?

01:38.558 --> 01:39.601
I didn't...
No, I mean...

01:39.684 --> 01:41.728
Uh... Well,
all the bars are closed

01:41.811 --> 01:43.980
and our
designated driver's like

01:44.063 --> 01:46.232
passed out in the back.
I thought...

01:46.316 --> 01:47.796
I thought it was over.
Is it not over?

01:47.859 --> 01:50.111
Well, let us celebrate
the brief moments

01:50.195 --> 01:51.946
that we have left
with each other, huh?

01:52.322 --> 01:55.074
Here's to the three of us.
Friends for life.

01:56.034 --> 01:57.243
Thanks, guys.

01:57.327 --> 01:59.367
- This was an awesome night.
- I will drink to that.

01:59.621 --> 02:01.289
Hey, uh,
you guys...

02:01.372 --> 02:03.541
You guys think I'm, like,
doing the right thing, right?

02:03.625 --> 02:05.084
Like marrying...

02:05.168 --> 02:06.586
Marrying Tracy?

02:11.382 --> 02:12.509
Are you happy?

02:13.593 --> 02:14.719
Mmm-hmm.

02:14.803 --> 02:18.056
If you were happy,
would you even
ask that question?

02:18.139 --> 02:20.475
Well, it's not
necessarily...

02:20.558 --> 02:23.038
I mean, marriage can
be scary, even if you
found the right girl.

02:23.061 --> 02:24.395
Yeah, but you're
scared of everything.

02:24.479 --> 02:27.273
You won't even ask out
the attractive girl
who works at your office.

02:27.357 --> 02:28.733
We work together.

02:28.817 --> 02:30.985
So did Siegfried and Roy.
And look at them.

02:31.069 --> 02:33.488
One of them got mauled
by a white tiger.

02:33.571 --> 02:34.906
It was a wildebeest.

02:35.448 --> 02:37.033
They don't do
a wildebeest show.

02:38.243 --> 02:40.245
Whatever you decide,
that is your decision.

02:40.328 --> 02:41.329
Wait,
hold on, hold on.

02:41.412 --> 02:44.666
It's not his decision.
It's our decision.

02:44.749 --> 02:46.125
What?
It is.

02:46.209 --> 02:47.209
That's what you said.

02:47.252 --> 02:49.629
We all have veto power
over each other's girls.

02:49.712 --> 02:51.631
Oh, no, I said that
when I was nine.

02:51.714 --> 02:52.924
I was a 9-year-old boy.

02:53.299 --> 02:54.551
We made a pact.

02:54.634 --> 02:57.303
I don't know,
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have
brought all this stuff up.

02:57.387 --> 02:59.430
No, dude.
You wanna make
a pros and cons list?

02:59.514 --> 03:00.765
Huh?

03:00.849 --> 03:02.100
Okay. Uh...

03:02.809 --> 03:04.435
- I love her.
- That's a pro.

03:04.519 --> 03:05.562
I'm happy.

03:05.645 --> 03:06.980
Okay,
we're ahead of the game.

03:07.063 --> 03:09.482
Cons would be
she eats slow.

03:10.817 --> 03:12.902
She just chews so slow.

03:12.986 --> 03:15.572
"She chews slow"?
That's the biggest
con you have?

03:15.655 --> 03:18.700
I mean, three-hour dinners
for the rest of your life.

03:18.783 --> 03:21.160
And I just
sort of have to

03:22.370 --> 03:25.957
change my old self in
order to be my new self.
You know?

03:26.040 --> 03:28.334
That's part of the thing.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

03:28.418 --> 03:30.712
Are you saying that
you can't be yourself
around Tracy?

03:30.795 --> 03:32.672
Ugh, that's
coming out wrong. No.

03:32.755 --> 03:34.549
I can be myself.
It's not that
I can't be myself,

03:34.632 --> 03:38.052
I just sort of need to
kind of have this new self.

03:38.136 --> 03:40.638
You're either being
yourself or you're
not being yourself.

03:40.722 --> 03:42.724
I'm myself, okay, guys?

03:42.807 --> 03:44.183
It's just that I have to...

03:44.267 --> 03:45.560
You have to?

03:45.643 --> 03:48.146
I want to evolve

03:48.229 --> 03:50.857
this old self
into a new self,

03:50.940 --> 03:52.650
so the old self

03:53.943 --> 03:55.737
goes to sleep

03:55.820 --> 03:58.448
and the new self
comes awake.

03:58.531 --> 04:01.826
And sometimes,
the new self is truer

04:01.910 --> 04:04.162
than any of the other
old selves could be.

04:05.163 --> 04:06.956
Do you...

04:07.040 --> 04:08.541
Do you do you
really wanna do this?

04:09.584 --> 04:11.961
Yes. Of course I do,
come on.

04:12.045 --> 04:14.005
I'm just high, man.
I'm just high.

04:14.631 --> 04:16.007
Forget I said any
of this stuff, okay?

04:16.089 --> 04:17.634
I just wanted to
talk things through,

04:17.716 --> 04:21.262
you know, before
I jump off the bridge.

04:21.930 --> 04:23.181
"Jump off the bridge"?

04:23.264 --> 04:24.474
Yeah, jump off the bridge.

04:24.557 --> 04:25.934
It's like a really
famous saying.

04:26.351 --> 04:28.478
Yeah, it does not pertain
to getting married.

04:28.561 --> 04:31.940
Mmm... I think you have that
mixed up, actually, but...

04:34.108 --> 04:35.818
Hey, Tracy.

04:35.902 --> 04:37.612
Yeah, yeah,
I'm coming out.

04:37.695 --> 04:39.489
Uh... Coming out.

04:39.572 --> 04:40.573
- Did you just hear that?
- Yeah.

04:40.657 --> 04:43.368
He just equated
getting married to suicide.

04:43.451 --> 04:45.870
No, I think he's having
jitters or something.

04:45.995 --> 04:47.455
That's not the jitters.

04:47.538 --> 04:49.916
She's a good person.
She's mean to waiters.

04:49.999 --> 04:52.543
She had hot coffee
burned on her
bare legs by that guy.

04:52.961 --> 04:54.963
- Hey, guys.
- Hey!

04:55.046 --> 04:56.297
There she is!

04:56.381 --> 04:57.966
How much weed did you smoke?

04:58.049 --> 04:59.217
All of it.

04:59.300 --> 05:01.302
You guys excited
about the wedding?

05:01.386 --> 05:02.845
Yeah!
Oh, yeah.

05:02.929 --> 05:04.138
Yeah. Jump off...
Yeah. Jumping off...

05:04.222 --> 05:06.142
Jumping off that bridge.
Jumping off that bridge.

06:11.122 --> 06:12.415
Okay,
time to go, man.

06:12.498 --> 06:14.792
It's time to go.
I've been sitting
here a long time.

06:15.209 --> 06:16.961
And what are we
doing here, man?
I gotta go.

06:17.045 --> 06:18.963
Just let me hang out
and think for a second.

06:19.047 --> 06:21.257
We've been parked
here for an hour.

06:21.340 --> 06:22.425
What would you do
if your best friend

06:22.508 --> 06:24.886
was about to make
the biggest mistake
of his life?

06:24.969 --> 06:26.637
What, she's cheating on him?
What's happening?

06:26.721 --> 06:28.765
No, I just don't think
they should get married.

06:28.848 --> 06:29.849
We were all hanging out

06:29.932 --> 06:31.642
and he was talking
about the pros and cons,

06:31.726 --> 06:33.061
and, I mean,
it was mostly cons.

06:33.644 --> 06:35.063
I don't know. I think
part of him wants me

06:35.146 --> 06:36.439
to go in there
and stop the wedding.

06:36.522 --> 06:38.399
That's crazy, right?
Yeah, that's crazy.

06:38.816 --> 06:42.153
We were all high
in Marty's van when
we were talking about it.

06:42.653 --> 06:44.030
I don't know, man.

06:44.113 --> 06:45.448
Weed is truth.

06:46.407 --> 06:48.618
Weed is truth.

06:48.701 --> 06:50.953
Right? People get high
and they say some real shit.

06:51.329 --> 06:55.500
I wish my friends had told me
I was making a mistake
before my ceremony.

06:55.625 --> 06:57.502
You wish your friends
had stopped you?

06:57.585 --> 07:00.630
Every day of my life.

07:00.713 --> 07:04.550
But we got married and then,
bing, bang, boom,
we have the children.

07:04.634 --> 07:08.137
Three small anchors
tethering me to
a ship that's sinking.

07:08.221 --> 07:10.598
Haunting me every day
from my kitchen.

07:10.681 --> 07:12.100
Great kids.

07:12.183 --> 07:13.226
Jesus.

07:13.309 --> 07:15.228
The middle one
is extra fat.

07:15.311 --> 07:17.396
But everybody
makes a mistake, huh?

07:17.980 --> 07:20.858
Sometimes, these mistakes,
they're for eternity.

07:24.987 --> 07:28.074
<i>How many words would
it take to really say</i>

07:28.449 --> 07:31.619
<i>How much you've</i>
<i>changed my life</i>
<i>in every single way?</i>

07:31.702 --> 07:34.997
<i>You make the good stuff better
And the bad stuff, too</i>

07:35.081 --> 07:38.376
<i>Yeah, my life is better
'Cause I get to do it with you</i>

07:39.710 --> 07:41.629
<i>Every night
when we eat dinner</i>

07:41.712 --> 07:43.214
<i>I get to chew it with you</i>

07:43.297 --> 07:46.259
<i>If we get sick,
I get to flu it with you</i>

07:46.342 --> 07:47.802
<i>And if we're
watching Green Card</i>

07:47.885 --> 07:49.595
<i>I get to Depardieu it with you</i>

07:49.679 --> 07:50.805
<i>Yeah, my life is better...</i>

07:50.888 --> 07:52.223
Everything okay?
What? Huh?

07:52.306 --> 07:53.474
Yeah. Tux looks great.

07:53.558 --> 07:54.642
Oh, thanks, yeah.

07:54.725 --> 07:57.103
It was my grandfather's.
He was Italian.

07:57.186 --> 07:59.564
He died in it.
Oh, okay.

07:59.647 --> 08:04.527
<i>Remember this vow
I will renew it with you</i>

08:04.610 --> 08:06.070
<i>My life is better</i>

08:06.154 --> 08:09.407
<i>'Cause I get to
do it with you</i>

08:09.907 --> 08:12.243
Okay. Now
it's time for the good part.

08:12.368 --> 08:14.537
I believe you're
providing the rings?
Oh, yeah.

08:17.039 --> 08:18.124
Got it.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.168
Oops.

08:21.085 --> 08:23.880
I, Nardo, take you, Tracy...

08:24.255 --> 08:27.258
I, Nardo, take you, Tracy...

08:27.341 --> 08:28.509
Stop!

08:30.803 --> 08:32.346
Stop!

08:32.429 --> 08:33.972
Oh, shit!
What?

08:34.056 --> 08:35.183
Stop the wedding! Stop!

08:35.265 --> 08:37.852
Please, stop the...
The wedding.

08:37.934 --> 08:39.020
I can't let you do this.

08:39.102 --> 08:40.270
Jason, don't!

08:40.354 --> 08:42.023
I'm sorry,
but I have to.

08:42.106 --> 08:43.691
What is happening?

08:44.192 --> 08:45.318
Stay away
from my daughter.

08:45.401 --> 08:46.402
Who, Tracy?

08:46.485 --> 08:49.197
Yuck. Gross.
I'm not here
because I love her.

08:49.280 --> 08:50.364
I'm here
because I love him.

08:50.448 --> 08:51.490
Me?

08:52.283 --> 08:53.326
I knew it.

08:53.409 --> 08:55.578
No, Jared,
it's not a gay thing.

08:55.661 --> 08:56.662
God, what is with him?

08:56.746 --> 08:58.915
His bangs are longer
than his face.

08:58.998 --> 09:00.458
I know that
as I said that,

09:00.541 --> 09:02.168
it did come out
kind of gay,

09:02.251 --> 09:03.878
but Nardo and I are
more than gay.

09:03.961 --> 09:06.297
We're best friends.
And that goes for...
For Evan, too.

09:06.631 --> 09:07.673
Leave me out of this.

09:07.757 --> 09:08.757
Hey, hey, Jason.

09:08.799 --> 09:10.760
Jason, you cannot
do this right now.

09:10.843 --> 09:13.012
Evan and I love you
too much to let you
go through with this.

09:13.095 --> 09:14.180
Leave me out of this!

09:14.263 --> 09:15.303
What the hell is going on?

09:15.348 --> 09:17.850
I'm sorry, Tracy,
I wanted to say this earlier.

09:17.934 --> 09:19.534
You know, before
your family got involved

09:19.602 --> 09:21.604
and Jesus was here.

09:21.687 --> 09:24.148
I didn't realize
this is way more awkward

09:24.232 --> 09:25.441
than I thought
it was gonna be.

09:25.524 --> 09:27.318
I thought that some
people would agree.

09:27.401 --> 09:29.820
Not that you would
carry me out on your
shoulders or anything,

09:29.904 --> 09:32.615
but you guys have really
left me hanging here.

09:33.115 --> 09:34.367
This is really...

09:34.867 --> 09:35.868
This is a toughie.

09:35.952 --> 09:37.411
But... But the point is

09:37.495 --> 09:38.829
that she is not
the one for him.

09:38.913 --> 09:39.914
You said it yourself.

09:39.997 --> 09:41.517
No, I did not.
I did not say that!
What?

09:41.624 --> 09:43.709
I never said that!
Yes, you did,
in Marty's van!

09:43.793 --> 09:45.419
I don't even remember
Marty's van.

09:45.503 --> 09:46.754
I was high in Marty's van.

09:46.837 --> 09:47.880
I was high in Marty's van!

09:47.964 --> 09:50.216
A lot of chronic
was being passed.

09:50.299 --> 09:51.979
Grammy, I'm sorry.
I don't smoke that crap.

09:52.343 --> 09:53.623
It's medical.
I don't smoke crap.

09:53.678 --> 09:54.971
You know what?
If anything,

09:55.054 --> 09:58.683
Nardo was just going
over the pros and cons
of you as a person.

09:58.766 --> 10:00.526
You can be a little,
you know...
You eat slow.

10:00.559 --> 10:02.103
It's not a big deal.
We were just talking.

10:02.186 --> 10:03.688
It was just guys
kind of gabbing...

10:03.771 --> 10:05.064
It was just guy talk.
Guy talk, guy talk.

10:05.147 --> 10:06.524
Stop, stop, stop, stop!
He's always
apologizing.

10:06.607 --> 10:08.276
You need to work on that.
He's always doing
something wrong.

10:08.359 --> 10:09.777
Stop it! Stop it!

10:09.860 --> 10:11.320
Okay, this is not what
I think. We're just...

10:11.404 --> 10:13.124
We're gonna go along
with the wedding, okay?

10:13.197 --> 10:14.740
We're gonna do the wedding,
okay?

10:14.824 --> 10:16.284
Nothing can stop us now.
We're...

10:20.162 --> 10:21.163
Tracy!

10:21.289 --> 10:22.290
Tracy!

10:23.374 --> 10:24.875
Well, this is dangerous.

10:25.293 --> 10:26.794
That's why that happened.

10:27.295 --> 10:29.046
Everybody smokes weed.

10:29.130 --> 10:30.172
Tracy!

10:30.256 --> 10:31.924
Don't even
speak to me, Evan.

10:32.049 --> 10:33.801
Tracy, wait,
don't leave!
You know what?

10:33.884 --> 10:35.761
I knew you guys
never liked me.

10:36.512 --> 10:38.806
But I never thought
you were gonna ruin my life.

10:38.889 --> 10:39.932
Tracy, I was just trying to...
You know what?

10:40.016 --> 10:42.101
We got the chapel till 6:00.
Why don't the three
of you guys

10:42.184 --> 10:43.602
just go ahead
and marry each other?

10:43.686 --> 10:45.896
Can we do that?
Because that
would be hilarious.

10:46.272 --> 10:47.815
I'm kidding. Obviously.

10:47.898 --> 10:49.233
Fuck you.

10:50.151 --> 10:52.028
- You're the worst.
- Tracy...

10:53.237 --> 10:54.989
Champagne?
Yes, thank you.

10:55.072 --> 10:57.158
You want one?
No, I'm good. Thank you.

10:58.200 --> 10:59.452
Thank you.

11:08.544 --> 11:09.587
Here, let me talk to him.

11:09.670 --> 11:11.839
Oh, yeah, 'cause clearly
you can handle things
appropriately.

11:11.922 --> 11:14.342
Hey, buddy. Look,
I know you're upset now,

11:14.425 --> 11:16.427
but it's gonna get better.

11:16.510 --> 11:17.928
It's like your
first day of rehab.

11:18.012 --> 11:20.252
It's hard to walk around
the Bellagio
sipping Coke Zero...

11:20.264 --> 11:22.016
Would you
shut the fuck up?

11:22.099 --> 11:24.352
I wanted to get married,
you asshole!

11:24.435 --> 11:25.436
What about in the van?

11:25.519 --> 11:27.480
I don't even
remember that, okay?

11:27.563 --> 11:29.065
I was fucking high.

11:29.148 --> 11:30.900
Yeah, but maybe
that was the point.

11:30.983 --> 11:34.028
That Marty's
sweet-ass van grass
was bringing out the truth,

11:34.111 --> 11:35.237
that you don't
really wanna do this.

11:35.321 --> 11:36.801
So I was going over
the pros and cons,

11:37.073 --> 11:38.074
that's normal.

11:38.157 --> 11:41.035
Everyone has cons, Jason.
I have cons.

11:41.118 --> 11:43.037
You are made of cons!

11:43.120 --> 11:44.663
I've accepted Tracy's cons.

11:44.747 --> 11:45.873
I love Tracy's cons.

11:45.956 --> 11:48.709
And...
And now you've... You've...
You've ruined everything!

11:48.793 --> 11:49.794
Hey, dumb fuck,

11:49.877 --> 11:52.380
how come you couldn't have
had this conversation
before the wedding?

11:52.463 --> 11:53.463
I did, Evan,

11:53.506 --> 11:54.673
I talked about this
last week!

11:54.757 --> 11:55.757
And what did he say?

11:55.800 --> 11:57.000
He said he
wanted to marry her.

11:57.009 --> 11:58.135
Okay, so what does
that say to you?

11:58.219 --> 11:59.303
It tells me
that he's wrong!

11:59.387 --> 12:00.763
Tracy isn't
the one for him!

12:00.846 --> 12:02.056
Yes, she is!

12:04.642 --> 12:05.643
Fucking dick!

12:54.358 --> 12:56.694
What's the point
of anything anymore?

12:57.820 --> 12:59.029
Of all of it?

12:59.113 --> 13:00.656
All of life?

13:00.739 --> 13:03.617
A stake has been
driven through my heart.

13:03.701 --> 13:04.702
Yeah.

13:06.203 --> 13:08.205
You know, I was thinking,

13:09.290 --> 13:10.791
why don't you
go after Tracy?

13:10.875 --> 13:13.544
You love her, you know it.
Who cares what Jason thinks?

13:13.711 --> 13:16.172
It's too late, Evan.

13:16.255 --> 13:18.883
Oh, come on.
Nothing's too late.

13:18.966 --> 13:20.509
It is.

13:20.593 --> 13:22.595
She's in Mexico.

13:22.678 --> 13:24.847
She is on our honeymoon

13:24.930 --> 13:26.223
by herself.

13:27.183 --> 13:29.185
Tracy's in Mexico?
Uh-huh.

13:29.685 --> 13:32.563
And she took both
the plane tickets
with her.

13:33.647 --> 13:35.483
I gotta go to work.

13:36.525 --> 13:38.402
But you're...
You're gonna be okay.

13:38.486 --> 13:41.322
Okay. Leave me.

13:41.405 --> 13:42.948
Leave me
like everybody else.

13:43.032 --> 13:46.118
You, Tracy,
the whole gang.

13:46.202 --> 13:48.829
I get it. I get it.

13:49.580 --> 13:52.416
No one wants to be
around a loser.

13:52.583 --> 13:54.293
I'm dirt.

13:54.376 --> 13:55.586
You're not dirt.

13:55.669 --> 13:58.005
Well, I'm garbage.
I'm something bad.

13:58.088 --> 13:59.924
You're not garbage.

14:00.007 --> 14:02.301
I'm a dirty cum rag, Evan.

14:02.384 --> 14:04.053
You know what that is?

14:06.639 --> 14:09.892
I heard
your roommate pranked
your boy Nardo's wedding.

14:09.975 --> 14:12.061
I don't wanna
talk about that.

14:12.144 --> 14:13.424
Oh, come on.
Well, you know what?

14:13.479 --> 14:15.439
Your roommates are lame,
so you should just
move in with us.

14:15.523 --> 14:18.067
Wait, did he tell you about
the fact that everyone

14:18.150 --> 14:21.111
has their own master bathroom?
With heated floors?

14:21.195 --> 14:23.989
And what's fun is
sometimes we trade.
We use each other's bathrooms.

14:24.114 --> 14:25.658
That doesn't sound
like so much fun.
It's a rush.

14:25.741 --> 14:27.159
Yep.
It's a rush?

14:27.243 --> 14:28.702
Mmm-hmm. It's
something new. A new
bathroom every day.

14:28.786 --> 14:30.266
You find out stuff
about your friends.

14:30.454 --> 14:32.331
Have you ever had
a traditional Viking meal?

14:32.456 --> 14:34.496
I can't say
that I have, no.
You've never had a goose

14:34.500 --> 14:38.087
shoved silly with venison
and elderberries and twigs

14:38.170 --> 14:40.422
and all sorts of things
that are natural, man?

14:40.506 --> 14:41.507
Pudding?

14:41.590 --> 14:42.716
You ever had pudding?

14:42.800 --> 14:43.842
Isn't that hard to stuff?

14:43.926 --> 14:45.386
Check out this brochure,
all right?

14:45.469 --> 14:46.804
I don't know. I...

14:46.971 --> 14:48.097
You know,
my roommates have been

14:48.180 --> 14:49.265
my best friends
since third grade,

14:49.348 --> 14:51.850
and I know that people
don't understand them
that great,

14:51.934 --> 14:53.769
- but I love them.
- All right, shut up.

14:53.852 --> 14:55.229
Here comes our future
shared girlfriend,

14:55.312 --> 14:56.772
so we'll talk
about this later.

14:56.897 --> 14:58.774
Act like a man.
Act like a man.
I am acting like a man.

14:58.857 --> 15:00.137
- I know, but act more...
- Evan.

15:01.235 --> 15:02.903
Can I borrow you
for a sec?
Yes. Yes.

15:02.987 --> 15:04.572
- Of course.
- Nice.

15:05.406 --> 15:06.490
Hi.

15:08.325 --> 15:09.618
Hi.
Hey, what's up?
How are you?

15:09.743 --> 15:11.245
Good.
Great,
that's good to hear.

15:11.328 --> 15:12.496
Talk to you.

15:13.539 --> 15:15.249
Let's go?
Yes, yeah, sorry.

15:15.833 --> 15:16.833
I'm glad you actually...

15:16.875 --> 15:19.378
This is a workplace,
keep it professional.

15:19.461 --> 15:20.462
Or don't.

15:22.214 --> 15:23.716
I'm glad you
actually grabbed me,

15:23.799 --> 15:24.758
because I wanted to
talk to you.

15:24.842 --> 15:26.343
I know we work
together, but...
Listen, listen!

15:26.427 --> 15:28.220
MacDonaldson really
likes your stuff.

15:28.304 --> 15:29.344
What?
When did he say that?

15:29.388 --> 15:31.640
In the department meeting.
He wants to see you, now.

15:32.057 --> 15:33.851
I'm not even
close to ready. I...

15:33.934 --> 15:35.974
This is a good thing.
Just watch,
do this, do this...

15:38.897 --> 15:40.899
Shake it out.
All right, shake it out.
I'll shake it out,

15:41.025 --> 15:42.276
but I'm not gonna
do that thing...
Relax.

15:42.359 --> 15:43.819
Your neck is tense.
My neck is tense?

15:43.902 --> 15:45.862
Well, I mean... I'm not...
You put me on the spot.

15:45.863 --> 15:47.197
Get it together.

15:47.865 --> 15:49.533
You're gonna blow it, dude.

15:50.117 --> 15:51.285
What?
Just kidding.

15:51.660 --> 15:52.661
Okay.

15:55.039 --> 15:57.666
I love the work
you've done here.

15:57.750 --> 16:00.502
I think you and I should
present this together
tomorrow.

16:00.586 --> 16:02.379
Really? That's great.

16:02.838 --> 16:05.257
I think you're
ready to move to
the industrial side.

16:05.382 --> 16:06.550
Tell me,

16:07.134 --> 16:08.802
how would you like to
steam with me tomorrow?

16:08.886 --> 16:10.721
Say, 8:00 a.m.?
Steam?

16:10.804 --> 16:12.139
Steam.

16:12.222 --> 16:14.642
You know what steaming
with me means,
I take it?

16:14.725 --> 16:15.809
Yeah, yeah.

16:15.893 --> 16:18.771
It means
we'll both be naked.

16:31.784 --> 16:33.327
Well, that is part of it.

16:36.538 --> 16:38.582
What...
What is the other part?

16:40.626 --> 16:42.878
<i>Excuse me.</i>
<i>There's a John McClane</i>
<i>here to see you, Evan.</i>

16:42.961 --> 16:44.713
<i>About the Nakatomi deal?</i>

16:44.797 --> 16:45.881
Nakatomi deal?

16:47.174 --> 16:48.425
Who's John McClane?

16:49.051 --> 16:50.344
Um...

16:50.427 --> 16:53.597
It's just
this side opportunity
I've been exploring.

16:53.681 --> 16:55.391
Could you tell him
that I'm busy right now

16:55.474 --> 16:56.634
and that I need
a few minutes?

16:56.684 --> 16:57.726
<i>I tried.</i>

16:57.810 --> 16:59.269
<i>He said it's urgent.</i>

17:00.437 --> 17:01.855
I'm sorry, sir.
Don't be.

17:01.939 --> 17:03.023
I like the hustle.

17:03.857 --> 17:04.858
Go on, get after it.

17:06.694 --> 17:07.861
Short meeting.

17:07.944 --> 17:09.029
Huh? Oh, I was paged.

17:09.113 --> 17:11.323
Paged? Paged by who?

17:11.406 --> 17:13.367
Uh... No one.
John McClane.

17:13.450 --> 17:15.993
Hmm... Bad cop with
a heart of gold?
Tortured by his past?

17:16.078 --> 17:17.871
You were paged by
the movie <i>Die Hard?</i>

17:17.954 --> 17:18.955
I guess so.

17:19.039 --> 17:21.040
So, what happened
with MacDonaldson?

17:21.125 --> 17:23.460
I don't know.
He asked me to
steam with him.

17:23.544 --> 17:25.421
No way!
That's awesome, Evan.

17:25.503 --> 17:26.505
Why?

17:26.588 --> 17:29.133
He always steams with
people he's gonna promote.

17:29.216 --> 17:32.219
He likes to seal the deal
with an old-fashioned
handshake at the club.

17:32.302 --> 17:34.680
So, I got the promotion?

17:34.763 --> 17:37.057
As long as you show up there
and shake his hand, yes.

17:37.141 --> 17:38.142
This is huge!

17:38.225 --> 17:40.894
Fucking piece of
shit peach tea!

17:40.978 --> 17:42.396
Please, peach tea.

17:42.855 --> 17:43.856
Shit.

17:45.023 --> 17:46.503
Did you know your
Snapples won't open?

17:46.567 --> 17:48.277
No, I didn't hear that.

17:48.360 --> 17:49.403
Oh, hey.

17:49.486 --> 17:50.487
Can you open this?

17:50.612 --> 17:52.656
You have no idea
how much we've heard
about this outfit.

17:52.740 --> 17:53.741
What?

17:53.949 --> 17:55.659
I'll give you a hint.
It's your red skirt.

17:55.743 --> 17:57.661
I'll give you another hint.
We like it.

17:57.745 --> 17:59.955
He's just kidding.
Isn't that right,
John McClane?

18:00.038 --> 18:01.165
Kidding? What?

18:01.248 --> 18:03.208
Are you saying that
my skirt is a joke?

18:03.292 --> 18:04.585
No, no, no, no.
We would never...

18:04.668 --> 18:06.628
We would never, uh,
mock your skirt.

18:06.712 --> 18:08.422
If anything, I think
you look good to go.

18:09.506 --> 18:10.506
"Good to go"?

18:10.549 --> 18:12.885
Good to go
out and about.

18:12.968 --> 18:14.428
Like I would take you now.

18:15.137 --> 18:16.346
- Take... Take me?
- Like...

18:17.181 --> 18:18.474
To a pizza parlor.

18:18.557 --> 18:19.767
I mean,
it's a good skirt.

18:20.517 --> 18:21.769
Taut.

18:22.936 --> 18:24.563
And, uh...

18:24.980 --> 18:26.023
Business sexy.

18:26.398 --> 18:28.609
I mean, I think you look

18:28.692 --> 18:32.196
like this is
work and play first,

18:32.279 --> 18:34.990
and then
it could be sex, too.

18:35.073 --> 18:36.116
Uh... Oh.

18:36.200 --> 18:37.951
But consensual.

18:38.702 --> 18:40.954
Yeah, I don't have anything
to help you with that.

18:42.372 --> 18:44.291
You look very good.

18:44.374 --> 18:45.751
Are you having a stroke?

18:46.668 --> 18:48.587
I'm gonna go back
to my office.

18:48.712 --> 18:51.423
Okay.
That's best.
Nice to meet you.

18:51.548 --> 18:53.300
And I'll get you
those reports.

18:55.052 --> 18:56.094
I thought that went great.

18:57.596 --> 18:59.014
Ow!

18:59.097 --> 19:00.098
Jeez!

19:01.058 --> 19:02.643
What is business sexy?

19:03.060 --> 19:05.771
Can we not
talk about it, please?

19:07.064 --> 19:08.649
That skirt is taut.

19:08.982 --> 19:10.150
Jason!

19:10.984 --> 19:12.861
You've been trying to ask
Elizabeth out for a year,

19:12.945 --> 19:14.655
but now you're all,
like, in your head.

19:14.738 --> 19:15.864
So when you try
and talk to her,

19:15.948 --> 19:16.990
you end up saying
something weird

19:17.074 --> 19:18.116
and kind of rapey.

19:18.575 --> 19:20.702
You can't come visit
me at work like this
unannounced.

19:20.828 --> 19:22.830
That's not what you
said in your message.
What message?

19:22.913 --> 19:24.081
You sent it.

19:26.083 --> 19:27.083
Telepathically.

19:27.125 --> 19:28.669
You are not
telepathic, Jason.

19:28.752 --> 19:30.295
Yes, I am.
You're just closed off.

19:30.379 --> 19:32.673
What if my boss asks me
about the Nakatomi deal?

19:32.798 --> 19:34.466
What am I
supposed to say?
Simple.

19:34.550 --> 19:36.093
You tell him that
a group of German terrorists

19:36.176 --> 19:37.803
seized the Nakatomi building

19:37.886 --> 19:41.515
and now, Nakatomi is
looking to unload
the Plaza for a price.

19:41.598 --> 19:42.641
You gotta
say it like that.

19:43.058 --> 19:45.394
"For a price."
Look at your own shoulder.

19:47.145 --> 19:48.355
What are you doing here?

19:48.438 --> 19:50.357
Oh. Nardo's missing.

19:50.440 --> 19:52.109
He's not answering his phone
and he's not in his room.

19:52.192 --> 19:53.193
We gotta go find him.

19:53.277 --> 19:54.987
I can't leave right now.
Okay.

19:55.070 --> 19:57.364
Then lend me your car,
I'll take my peach tea
and go get him myself.

19:57.447 --> 19:59.199
You know you can't
take my company car

19:59.283 --> 20:01.577
'cause I need to be
with you if you're
gonna be driving it.

20:01.660 --> 20:04.454
Our best friend is missing
and you're worried
about your car?

20:05.873 --> 20:08.458
I got... I have something
to tell you, I just...

20:09.334 --> 20:10.419
I'm moving out.

20:11.003 --> 20:12.004
What?

20:12.504 --> 20:13.922
You ruined Nardo's wedding,

20:14.006 --> 20:16.049
there's jelly beans
everywhere,

20:16.133 --> 20:18.719
you're a fucking
hurricane, man.

20:18.802 --> 20:20.095
Well, you know what?

20:20.178 --> 20:22.180
There's a lot of negativity
coming from you right now.

20:22.264 --> 20:24.141
I think it's impeding
your general happiness,

20:24.224 --> 20:26.560
so I really,
really encourage you
to just smoke some weed.

20:26.643 --> 20:28.228
What?
And it'll be better.

20:28.312 --> 20:29.312
Get rid of it!

20:29.354 --> 20:31.607
Get rid of it?
Get rid of it!

20:31.690 --> 20:34.276
What are you doing?
Don't smoke it...
Don't smoke it!

20:34.359 --> 20:35.903
Don't smoke it!
Put it in your pocket!

20:35.986 --> 20:37.946
Put it one of
your nine pockets
on those shorts!

20:38.280 --> 20:39.406
Damn it, Jason!

20:39.781 --> 20:41.116
Okay, jeez.

20:44.161 --> 20:45.162
Okay, all right.

20:45.704 --> 20:46.830
I gotta go back to work.

20:49.082 --> 20:51.668
<i>I'd like to take his face.</i>

20:53.045 --> 20:54.129
Off.

20:55.380 --> 20:56.590
Oh, Nicolas.

21:05.265 --> 21:08.101
Hey, Jason?
Have you seen my Ambien?

21:09.603 --> 21:11.355
Never mind, I found them.

21:13.190 --> 21:14.191
Really?

21:26.161 --> 21:27.329
Oh, he 'pooned him!

21:29.039 --> 21:30.248
Hello?

21:30.332 --> 21:32.709
<i>Hello,</i>
<i>I have a collect call</i>
<i>from a Mr. Nardo.</i>

21:33.085 --> 21:34.127
Yeah, I'll accept
the charges.

21:34.211 --> 21:35.796
<i>Jason! I'm still
really pissed at you,</i>

21:35.879 --> 21:37.381
<i>but Evan is not
picking up his phone.</i>

21:37.965 --> 21:40.300
<i>I went down to the resort
to get Tracy back,</i>

21:40.384 --> 21:42.970
<i>and, uh,
I got carjacked, man!</i>

21:43.053 --> 21:44.304
You got carjacked?

21:44.388 --> 21:45.847
<i>They took my Fiat, Jason!</i>

21:45.931 --> 21:47.683
<i>And I'm lost,
and I'm scared</i>

21:47.766 --> 21:49.476
<i>and you gotta come down
and get me, man.</i>

21:49.559 --> 21:50.686
Okay, where are you?

21:50.769 --> 21:52.062
<i>I don't know.
All I know is</i>

21:52.145 --> 21:54.189
I am naked in
the middle of Mexico!

21:54.272 --> 21:55.691
<i>You're naked?
Are you sure?</i>

21:56.400 --> 21:58.068
Yes, I'm fucking sure!

21:58.151 --> 21:59.945
You can see your
penis and everything?
<i>Yes!</i>

22:00.028 --> 22:01.029
<i>Why are you naked?</i>

22:01.113 --> 22:02.114
I was wearing
my grandfather's tux,

22:02.197 --> 22:03.490
you know,
the Italian one?

22:03.573 --> 22:04.783
They took that, too.

22:04.866 --> 22:07.411
So, you got carjacked,
and then you got tuxedojacked?

22:07.494 --> 22:08.829
<i>I am naked!</i>

22:08.912 --> 22:10.497
Okay? They're gonna get me!

22:10.580 --> 22:12.124
We've all seen
the movie <i>Taken.</i>

22:12.207 --> 22:13.667
Okay, relax.
They're not gonna
<i>Taken</i> you.

22:13.750 --> 22:14.960
That doesn't happen
down there.

22:15.043 --> 22:16.628
You know what they do
do sometimes?

22:16.712 --> 22:18.964
<i>They kill you and then
they hide drugs in your corpse</i>

22:19.047 --> 22:20.632
and they ship your corpse
to your grandmother

22:20.716 --> 22:22.596
and then somebody
shows up and
kills your grandma

22:22.676 --> 22:23.927
and takes the drugs.

22:24.011 --> 22:25.178
<i>That actually happens a lot.</i>

22:25.262 --> 22:26.888
Is that...
Are you serious?

22:26.972 --> 22:28.974
Are you fucking serious?
Grammy!

22:29.099 --> 22:30.976
No way!
<i>No, no, no, no! Listen.</i>

22:31.059 --> 22:33.103
Forget I said that.
Forget I said that.
<i>God!</i>

22:33.186 --> 22:35.605
I am going to
die here, Jason!

22:35.689 --> 22:37.774
I should be married
and on my honeymoon,

22:37.858 --> 22:39.651
but because of you
and your shit,

22:39.735 --> 22:42.571
I am going to
fucking get <i>Taken!</i>

22:42.654 --> 22:43.780
<i>Nardo. Nardo,
listen to me.</i>

22:43.864 --> 22:45.490
Everything is gonna be okay.
Say it.

22:45.574 --> 22:47.159
Everything is gonna be okay.

22:47.242 --> 22:48.910
No one is <i>Taken</i>-ing anyone.

22:48.994 --> 22:50.787
No one is <i>Taken</i>-ing anybody.

22:50.871 --> 22:51.872
Shit! What the fuck?

22:51.955 --> 22:53.248
What's that sound?
<i>What's that noise?</i>

22:53.290 --> 22:55.375
Oh, my God!
Are there snakes here?
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

22:55.459 --> 22:58.045
There's rattlers,
there's serpents,

22:58.128 --> 23:00.088
there's <i>cobrinhas,</i>
which are tiny little cobras.

23:00.172 --> 23:01.381
<i>Fuck, no! Okay, no,</i>

23:01.465 --> 23:02.883
it's just a sign
that was blowing
in the wind.

23:02.966 --> 23:06.261
That was a bad example.
But shit is fucking
crazy out here, man.

23:06.344 --> 23:07.471
Look around.
What town are you in?

23:07.554 --> 23:08.597
<i>Town?</i>

23:08.680 --> 23:10.766
Um... Shit, I don't know.
I don't know.

23:10.849 --> 23:12.309
Uh...

23:12.392 --> 23:13.894
Okay, there's a sign.

23:13.977 --> 23:17.272
It says... It says
"Mexico" on it. Mexico.

23:17.355 --> 23:19.483
You're in Mexico, Mexico?

23:19.649 --> 23:22.152
Mexico, Mexico?
Is that even a fucking place?

23:22.235 --> 23:23.278
<i>Does that exist?</i>

23:24.613 --> 23:25.655
Hold on.

23:25.989 --> 23:27.789
The sign has something
written on it. It says,

23:27.824 --> 23:29.826
<i>"27, San Jacinto."</i>

23:29.910 --> 23:31.578
Okay, 27, San Jacinto.

23:31.661 --> 23:32.704
Stay where you are.

23:32.788 --> 23:34.039
<i>That can't be
that far from L.A.</i>

23:34.122 --> 23:35.916
Hurry, hurry, hurry!
Hurry the fuck up!

23:35.999 --> 23:37.375
<i>I'll see you in
two to three hours.</i>

23:46.843 --> 23:47.844
What?

23:49.971 --> 23:50.972
Tights!

23:59.856 --> 24:00.857
Hey, man!

24:02.359 --> 24:03.401
Hey.

24:04.903 --> 24:05.987
Do you want
a piece of cake?

24:06.071 --> 24:08.365
I brought it.
It's in the backseat.
It's very good.

24:10.117 --> 24:11.868
What's happening?
Why am I in the car?

24:11.993 --> 24:14.412
Nardo's stranded.
We're going to Mexico.

24:15.539 --> 24:17.332
I'm serious.
What?

24:17.415 --> 24:18.416
I tried to wake you.

24:18.500 --> 24:20.100
I had to carry you.
Oh! Oh, no, no, no...

24:20.127 --> 24:22.087
I don't know what
sleeping pills
you're taking,

24:22.170 --> 24:23.296
but they are heavy duty.

24:23.380 --> 24:24.756
No, no. No, no, no...

24:25.215 --> 24:27.634
I can't... I can't...
I can't have this happen.

24:27.717 --> 24:29.511
I can't go to
Mexico right now.

24:29.594 --> 24:31.471
I'm sorry, but I can't
use the company car

24:31.555 --> 24:32.715
without you here
to supervise.

24:32.722 --> 24:34.599
That's your rule.
You made that very clear.

24:34.683 --> 24:35.723
So, you just kidnapped me?

24:36.226 --> 24:38.478
I had no choice.
Nardo's naked.

24:39.062 --> 24:40.105
He's naked?

24:40.188 --> 24:41.773
Yeah. Nude.

24:42.566 --> 24:43.733
In Mexico?

24:44.568 --> 24:46.444
What time is it?
Midnight.

24:46.528 --> 24:47.904
Oh, fuck, Jason!

24:47.988 --> 24:49.322
All right, before you
get really worked up,

24:49.406 --> 24:50.532
I've already
thought this through.

24:50.615 --> 24:51.658
Look at the GPS.

24:51.741 --> 24:53.341
We're here, heading
south of Los Angeles.

24:53.410 --> 24:57.414
Now, Nardo is here,
14 miles south of
the Mexican border. Okay?

24:57.539 --> 25:00.542
Two and half hours down,
that puts Nardo in
the car at 2:30 a.m.

25:00.625 --> 25:02.335
Then three hours
back up to Los Angeles,

25:02.419 --> 25:04.212
that puts us in L.A.
at 5:30 a.m.

25:04.296 --> 25:06.173
Your meeting's
at 8:00, right?
Yeah.

25:06.256 --> 25:08.884
Okay? Then we have
two and a half hours
of flex time.

25:08.967 --> 25:10.844
You could have at least
brought me something to wear.

25:10.927 --> 25:11.928
I did.

25:12.012 --> 25:14.372
I brought your
dry cleaning, your wallet
and your toothbrush.

25:14.431 --> 25:17.017
You're all set
for your meeting.
Off you go.

25:18.602 --> 25:19.936
This is not
my dry cleaning.

25:20.020 --> 25:22.189
They gave me this by mistake,
I was supposed to
bring it back today.

25:22.272 --> 25:23.523
What is it?

25:23.607 --> 25:25.192
It's a woman's pant suit.

25:25.609 --> 25:29.112
Well, sometimes life wants
you to put on a pant suit
and drive to Mexico.

25:29.279 --> 25:31.489
If I do this,
I am doing it for Nardo.

25:31.615 --> 25:33.825
We are driving to Mexico
and then we are
driving right back.

25:33.909 --> 25:34.909
No extra stops.

25:34.951 --> 25:36.745
No other stops?
No other stops.

25:36.828 --> 25:38.079
None after this one.

25:38.205 --> 25:39.956
Whoa,
whoa, whoa! Wait!

25:40.040 --> 25:41.458
Oh, where are we going?

25:41.666 --> 25:43.251
Remember when
I lost my wallet?

25:43.335 --> 25:45.629
I remember when you
jumped in a pool with it
in your back pocket.

25:45.712 --> 25:47.047
And I remember when
you left it out
in the sun to dry.

25:47.130 --> 25:49.216
I remember
all those things.

25:49.758 --> 25:51.134
You go do whatever
you have to do.

25:51.218 --> 25:52.594
I'm just gonna
stay in the car.

25:52.677 --> 25:53.929
No, no, no, no.

25:54.012 --> 25:56.264
This guy's kind of hardcore.
I need your help.

25:57.682 --> 26:00.477
I don't know how much
help I'm gonna be.
Look at me.

26:01.144 --> 26:02.312
You look great.

26:03.521 --> 26:04.856
I look like a Golden Girl.

26:05.982 --> 26:07.567
The best Golden Girl!

26:07.651 --> 26:09.778
I don't know, I feel
like I have a camel toe.

26:09.861 --> 26:11.321
Remind me why
we're here again?

26:11.404 --> 26:13.073
Well, remember
when I lost my wallet?

26:13.156 --> 26:14.824
Well, you can't leave
the country without an ID,

26:14.908 --> 26:16.493
so this guy's
gonna make me one.

26:16.576 --> 26:18.787
Shh! Shut up.
People are trying to sleep.

26:19.496 --> 26:20.580
He's 11.

26:20.664 --> 26:21.915
Here. It's all there.

26:21.998 --> 26:23.250
Good.

26:23.333 --> 26:25.710
Now get your ass inside
before you wake up my moms.

26:29.381 --> 26:30.715
Ahh!

26:30.799 --> 26:32.092
Jesus!

26:32.175 --> 26:33.927
That flash is really bright.

26:34.010 --> 26:35.053
Don't smile so much.

26:35.136 --> 26:36.680
It's a license,
not the fucking prom.

26:36.763 --> 26:38.682
Good one, Kenny.
Excellent.

26:40.517 --> 26:41.518
Ahh!

26:42.769 --> 26:45.021
Shit! Keep it down!

26:45.105 --> 26:46.356
That was loud, huh?

26:46.856 --> 26:47.941
Kenny, sweetie?

26:48.024 --> 26:49.067
Shit! It's my fucking mom!

26:49.150 --> 26:50.568
Hide, hide, hide!

26:51.194 --> 26:52.195
Kenny?

26:58.827 --> 27:00.161
Kenny, honey, you okay?

27:00.537 --> 27:02.372
Sorry, Mom.
I had a bad dream.

27:02.455 --> 27:05.125
I was just in here,
reading <i>Chicken Soup</i>
<i>for the Teenage Soul.</i>

27:05.208 --> 27:06.334
Aw...

27:06.418 --> 27:08.211
Sweetie pie, come here.

27:08.295 --> 27:10.463
Hop on the mommy train.

27:10.547 --> 27:11.965
Oh, there you go.

27:12.048 --> 27:13.300
Who's my guy?

27:13.383 --> 27:14.884
I am.

27:14.968 --> 27:16.136
Who's my guy?

27:16.219 --> 27:17.387
I am.

27:20.181 --> 27:21.558
She can't see us.

27:25.312 --> 27:26.632
Wait, wait, wait!
Don't freak out!

27:26.646 --> 27:28.486
Who the fuck are you?
We're friends of Kenny's.

27:28.523 --> 27:29.733
Yeah, he's making me
a fake ID.

27:29.858 --> 27:31.151
What are they talking about?

27:31.234 --> 27:32.444
I don't know.

27:32.527 --> 27:33.778
What do you
mean, you don't know?
You know!

27:33.862 --> 27:36.531
Look at
the camera and everything!
I'm Fletcher Simmons!

27:36.614 --> 27:38.867
Yeah! He's like a weird
little businessman!

27:38.950 --> 27:40.577
Wait, is this true?

27:41.578 --> 27:42.620
The truth is,

27:43.163 --> 27:44.372
they gave me this money

27:44.456 --> 27:46.624
to take pictures
of my balls.
What?

27:46.708 --> 27:48.001
- That's bullshit, Kenny!
- Oh, my God!

27:48.084 --> 27:49.419
That is way out of line!
No, I would not take...

27:49.502 --> 27:51.338
Why would we want pictures
of a boy's balls?

27:51.421 --> 27:54.007
If anything, we would
need pictures of
the whole shaft and...

27:54.090 --> 27:55.717
What?
You stay away from him!

27:55.800 --> 27:57.880
No, no. Kenny and I are cool.
Come, here, little boy.

27:59.262 --> 28:00.847
You stay away from him!

28:04.434 --> 28:05.643
We've got perverts!

28:08.605 --> 28:10.285
That's a dick move, Kenny,
and you know it!

28:14.110 --> 28:15.153
Oh!

28:16.112 --> 28:17.113
Ow!

28:20.658 --> 28:21.951
Perverts!

28:24.662 --> 28:26.456
Help! Help!

28:26.706 --> 28:28.208
Evan!

28:29.376 --> 28:30.752
Honey, I got him!

28:30.835 --> 28:32.170
Who are you?

28:32.253 --> 28:34.631
I'm Kenny's
other mom, fucker.

28:38.802 --> 28:39.803
Jason!

28:39.969 --> 28:41.679
What a terrible family!

28:41.805 --> 28:43.598
Keys, keys, keys, keys!

28:43.681 --> 28:44.682
Okay, hold on.

29:04.244 --> 29:06.079
Come on, Jason,
pick up the phone.

29:06.704 --> 29:08.373
It's him!
Pull over, pull over!

29:08.456 --> 29:09.456
- Hello?
<i>- Jason!</i>

29:09.499 --> 29:10.625
Nardo!
<i>Evan! Yes!</i>

29:10.708 --> 29:12.043
Oh, my God, yes!

29:13.211 --> 29:15.211
Hey, Nardo.
How's it going, man?
Where are you guys?

29:15.255 --> 29:16.256
Uh,
we're about halfway,

29:16.339 --> 29:18.099
but we are on our way.
We know your location.

29:18.133 --> 29:20.760
Wait, no, no, no!
I'm not there anymore, okay?

29:20.844 --> 29:22.762
Yeah, I ran into a town

29:22.846 --> 29:24.597
and now my tights are ripped.

29:24.681 --> 29:26.266
Your tights?
<i>Yeah, I actually dig them,</i>

29:26.349 --> 29:28.101
and I'm kind of bummed
that they're ruined.

29:28.184 --> 29:29.561
Where are you now?
What are you looking at?

29:29.644 --> 29:30.854
What do you see
around you?

29:30.937 --> 29:33.565
Uh... I don't know,
it's hard to say.
Everywhere I go,

29:33.648 --> 29:35.692
everything's in fucking
Mexican words.

29:35.775 --> 29:36.776
<i>You mean Spanish?</i>

29:36.985 --> 29:38.486
<i>I mean Mexican.</i>

29:39.320 --> 29:42.282
It's Mexico, man.
I'm not in Spain.

29:42.449 --> 29:43.658
<i>Fucking idiot!</i>

29:43.741 --> 29:45.618
Look around you.
What do you see?

29:45.702 --> 29:48.079
Uh... Okay, there's
something that says...

29:48.621 --> 29:49.622
Fucking what?

29:53.042 --> 29:55.170
Oh, "Get casheer."
"Get cassair"?

29:55.253 --> 29:56.337
"Get casher"?

29:56.421 --> 29:57.422
"Get cashhere."

29:57.881 --> 29:59.883
"Get cash here," Nardo?

30:03.511 --> 30:05.180
Sorry. It does say,
"Get cash here."

30:05.263 --> 30:08.057
Actually, below, it says,
"U.S. Wire Service," but...

30:08.141 --> 30:09.225
Okay, new plan.

30:09.350 --> 30:10.810
<i>We're gonna wire you $500.</i>

30:10.894 --> 30:13.605
<i>That way,</i>
<i>you can go to the resort</i>
<i>and I can go back to L.A.</i>

30:13.730 --> 30:15.398
Do you have
your ID on you?
<i>No, Evan,</i>

30:15.482 --> 30:17.192
I don't have an ID.
I have tights.

30:17.275 --> 30:19.068
You're going to
find someone with an ID

30:19.152 --> 30:21.154
and then I will wire them
$50 extra to say

30:21.237 --> 30:22.697
<i>thank you for the favor.</i>
Yes, thank you.

30:22.780 --> 30:25.325
Thank you so much!
Okay, just hold on.

30:26.075 --> 30:27.494
<i>Hola. Hola.</i>

30:27.577 --> 30:28.578
<i>Aloha.</i>

30:28.661 --> 30:29.662
What?

30:29.746 --> 30:33.500
I have a friend who's trying
to send me money in there

30:33.583 --> 30:36.294
and I just need
someone with an ID card

30:36.377 --> 30:37.921
to go in there
and sign for it.

30:38.004 --> 30:39.506
I'll give you 50 bucks.

30:39.589 --> 30:42.008
60.
$60!

30:42.091 --> 30:44.385
Well, it's hardly
a time to bargain. Yes.

30:44.469 --> 30:45.970
- Yes, $60.
<i>- Okay.</i>

30:46.054 --> 30:47.096
Okay, great.

30:47.180 --> 30:49.641
You're saving my hide,
honestly.

30:49.724 --> 30:51.518
Thank you so much!
Mmm-hmm.

30:51.601 --> 30:54.938
Okay, send the money
to Sarah McLachlan.

30:58.358 --> 30:59.484
Like the Sarah McLachlan?

30:59.567 --> 31:00.610
Love Sarah McLachlan!

31:01.277 --> 31:03.780
She's a very famous singer.
You sure you're
Sarah McLachlan?

31:03.863 --> 31:04.989
Yeah. Why?

31:05.073 --> 31:07.033
Ask her if she's
the Sarah McLachlan.

31:08.493 --> 31:10.662
It's the Mexican version.

31:10.745 --> 31:13.414
Nardo, I am going to wire
you and Sarah McLachlan
money.

31:13.498 --> 31:14.582
Just hang tight,
okay, pal?

31:14.666 --> 31:16.042
Evan, thank you!

31:16.125 --> 31:18.628
Okay, so where do we wire
money from at this hour?

31:18.711 --> 31:20.046
You know,
Marty works near here.

31:20.129 --> 31:21.569
I bet we could
wire money from there.

31:26.511 --> 31:28.638
Look, they spelled
"sluts" wrong, right?

31:28.721 --> 31:30.723
If the "O" was a "U."
It's a minor change.

31:30.807 --> 31:32.058
Hey, can you handle
this wire transfer?

31:32.141 --> 31:33.142
I gotta make
a work call real quick.

31:33.226 --> 31:34.310
Are you gonna
ask out Elizabeth?

31:34.394 --> 31:36.020
I am not messing around
with anyone from work.

31:36.104 --> 31:38.398
Oh, don't pretend like
it's an ethical thing, okay?

31:38.481 --> 31:39.607
You're scared
because you like her

31:39.691 --> 31:40.775
and you can't even
talk to her.

31:40.858 --> 31:41.859
Hey!

31:48.157 --> 31:49.409
Hello?
Hey, it's me.

31:49.492 --> 31:51.327
I mean, it's Evan.
It's not "me," it's Evan.

31:51.703 --> 31:52.787
Oh, hey.

31:52.870 --> 31:54.622
I'm sorry to
catch you so late.

31:54.706 --> 31:56.332
That's okay.
What's going on?

31:56.916 --> 32:00.128
Uh, well, I wanted to
touch base with you
about the steam tomorrow.

32:00.420 --> 32:02.714
You're calling me now
to touch base?

32:02.797 --> 32:05.258
<i>Look, there's an outside shot
that I might be a little late.</i>

32:05.341 --> 32:07.468
I'm taking my mom
to the dentist.

32:07.552 --> 32:08.970
Where are you?

32:09.637 --> 32:11.764
I'm in L.A.
Tell her.

32:11.848 --> 32:12.974
Uh... The Sizzler.

32:13.057 --> 32:14.309
I love the Sizzler.

32:14.392 --> 32:15.476
<i>You know what?
Don't worry about it.</i>

32:15.560 --> 32:16.603
<i>Order up!</i>

32:16.686 --> 32:19.230
Don't be an asshole.
Just tell me what's going on.

32:19.314 --> 32:20.481
Sizzling steaks!

32:20.565 --> 32:21.685
You know what?
I have to run.

32:21.774 --> 32:23.109
Look at this menu!
I'm sorry about this,
Elizabeth.

32:23.192 --> 32:24.193
I will talk to you tomorrow.
Goodbye.

32:24.277 --> 32:25.528
I want a twice-loaded
baked potato.

32:25.570 --> 32:27.488
Great. Now Elizabeth
hates me.
What? I helped. Marty!

32:27.572 --> 32:29.032
But you could also...
Oh, my God!

32:29.115 --> 32:31.117
Put this in my office
and do not take a bite.

32:31.200 --> 32:32.400
Are you kidding me?
What is up?

32:33.202 --> 32:34.871
Yeah! All right!

32:34.954 --> 32:36.247
My favorite customer!

32:36.331 --> 32:37.611
That means a lot
coming from you.

32:37.665 --> 32:39.876
'Cause it means you lose.

32:39.959 --> 32:41.127
We're actually not here
to gamble, Marty.

32:41.210 --> 32:42.295
Oh, okay. Right.

32:42.378 --> 32:43.755
I get what you're saying.

32:43.838 --> 32:46.007
You wanna party
in Marty's van.

32:46.132 --> 32:48.092
No, no.
Yeah, I'll do that.
Let's do that.

32:48.176 --> 32:49.176
Check this out.

32:49.218 --> 32:51.095
Maybe they're sisters,
maybe they're friends.

32:51.721 --> 32:53.222
I hope they're lesbians.

32:54.098 --> 32:55.698
Come on,
I wanna show you this.
Come here.

32:55.725 --> 32:57.605
You know, I've actually
been in your van, Marty.

32:57.644 --> 32:59.228
Yeah, you wish!

32:59.312 --> 33:00.396
Who the fuck
is this guy?

33:00.605 --> 33:02.940
Only cool guys are
allowed in Marty's van.

33:03.024 --> 33:04.734
Can we just please
make a wire transfer?

33:06.778 --> 33:08.488
All right.
Let's go on back.
Thank you.

33:08.571 --> 33:11.324
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
No, no, no. Turquoise Tommy
stays out here.

33:11.407 --> 33:14.077
You're good, okay? No.

33:14.160 --> 33:15.203
Get him out of here.
Thank you.

33:15.244 --> 33:17.163
Marty.
We know each other, Marty.
Hey, hey, hey. Hey.

33:17.246 --> 33:19.082
Look, Marty has
great instincts, okay?

33:19.165 --> 33:22.168
Now, let me take care
of the wire transfer
and you go chill at the bar.

33:22.251 --> 33:24.796
Look,
there's an attractive girl.
Go over there and hit on her.

33:24.879 --> 33:26.506
I am not hitting
on a random girl

33:26.589 --> 33:29.842
at a random casino
in the middle of the night.

33:29.926 --> 33:33.179
Evan,
earlier you told Elizabeth
she looked good to go.

33:33.262 --> 33:34.305
Do you remember that?
Yeah.

33:34.389 --> 33:35.390
As I was standing there,
cringing. Right?

33:35.473 --> 33:36.474
I know it was bad.

33:36.557 --> 33:37.850
It was really, really bad.
I know. I know.

33:37.934 --> 33:39.227
So your skills
have fallen off.

33:39.310 --> 33:40.550
Now, go over there
and practice.

33:40.603 --> 33:41.854
She's gonna reject you,

33:41.938 --> 33:44.219
but you'll learn something,
all right?
There's no downside.

33:44.273 --> 33:46.401
I could think of, like,
100 downsides, Jason.

33:46.484 --> 33:47.568
Just go over there.

33:47.652 --> 33:49.987
I'll borrow some clothes
from Marty for you, okay?

33:50.113 --> 33:51.823
And then you go
hit on her, come on!

33:51.906 --> 33:53.908
We're in a casino.
Let's have fun.

33:59.789 --> 34:00.790
Yes!

34:00.873 --> 34:03.710
I am Hugo!

34:05.503 --> 34:06.713
I'm Hugo.

34:11.134 --> 34:12.301
Hey.

34:12.385 --> 34:13.469
Is it cool
if I sit here?

34:13.553 --> 34:14.887
Are you sure
you wanna do that?

34:14.971 --> 34:16.222
Yeah, why wouldn't I?

34:16.304 --> 34:18.141
Well, I mean,
you've heard the stories.

34:18.224 --> 34:22.228
Nice guy has drinks
with a strange girl
in a casino,

34:22.311 --> 34:24.731
she gets him
up to her room,

34:24.813 --> 34:26.524
one thing
leads to another,

34:27.650 --> 34:31.237
he wakes up three days later
missing a kidney.

34:31.320 --> 34:32.530
Yeah, well,
I don't have that much time,

34:32.612 --> 34:33.853
so I think I'll
take my chances.

34:34.031 --> 34:35.992
That's a spooky shirt.

34:36.117 --> 34:37.493
Are you a magician?

34:37.618 --> 34:40.413
You know what?
I borrowed this, actually.

34:40.496 --> 34:43.331
But careful,
I will cast a spell on you.

34:43.416 --> 34:46.293
You'll have sex with me
and you won't even know it.

34:47.670 --> 34:48.909
Not against your will.
That's...

34:49.505 --> 34:50.505
That's rape.

34:53.967 --> 34:56.012
I love it.
You're hilarious.

34:56.971 --> 35:00.224
Two vodka gimlets,
compliments of
the Amazing Hugo.

35:02.602 --> 35:04.270
You know
the Amazing Hugo?

35:04.353 --> 35:06.189
Yeah, well, I come here
a lot on business.

35:06.272 --> 35:07.857
Oh.

35:09.066 --> 35:10.151
Mmm!

35:14.030 --> 35:15.031
You're cute.

35:16.199 --> 35:17.492
Thank you.

35:21.662 --> 35:22.663
Mmm!

35:35.760 --> 35:37.428
Hi.
Hello.

35:38.638 --> 35:40.640
What... What happened?

35:40.723 --> 35:43.142
Well, you passed out.

35:43.643 --> 35:44.894
Are we...

35:45.686 --> 35:47.647
Are we having sex?

35:47.730 --> 35:49.690
No, I'm sorry.
We're not.

35:49.774 --> 35:51.317
I'm prepping you.

35:51.400 --> 35:53.528
Prepping me?
Ooh. Hmm.

35:54.570 --> 35:56.072
I need to be prepped.

35:57.698 --> 35:59.033
Wait a minute.

35:59.450 --> 36:00.493
Are you taking my kidney?

36:00.576 --> 36:03.663
Yes, I am.
I'm afraid so.

36:05.122 --> 36:06.123
Why are your clothes off?

36:06.207 --> 36:08.459
Because I didn't
want to get blood on them.

36:10.253 --> 36:11.254
Why can't I move my arms?

36:11.754 --> 36:13.214
Why can't I move my arms?

36:13.297 --> 36:14.632
Oh, because
you're paralyzed. See?

36:17.802 --> 36:18.803
My God!

36:18.928 --> 36:20.808
You're really not even
supposed to be conscious.

36:20.888 --> 36:22.139
What?
Hugo?

36:22.765 --> 36:24.183
Why the fuck
is he awake?

36:24.600 --> 36:26.185
Boom!

36:26.269 --> 36:28.062
The Amazing Hugo?
Yeah, you a fan?

36:28.563 --> 36:30.189
Not really a fan.

36:30.273 --> 36:31.273
Ha-ha. Whatever.

36:31.357 --> 36:33.067
What's up with
the anesthesia?
I'm not using it.

36:33.150 --> 36:34.360
I'm using tranquilizers
on this one.

36:34.443 --> 36:36.279
Oh, you're using
tranquilizers? Why?

36:36.362 --> 36:37.864
Because amethocaine
is expensive.

36:37.947 --> 36:39.782
I wonder why.
Probably because it works.

36:39.907 --> 36:41.617
Hey, he's numb, isn't he?

36:41.701 --> 36:44.203
Don't you... Don't you usually
take kidneys from the back?

36:44.287 --> 36:46.831
Oh, yeah,
that's how doctors do it.
We go in the front, though.

36:46.914 --> 36:49.000
Just scoop everything out
until we find the kidney,

36:49.083 --> 36:50.209
just rip that out,

36:50.293 --> 36:52.962
throw it in a cooler
and we are outta here
while you bleed out.

36:53.462 --> 36:56.382
This is like a giant,
human-sized game
of <i>Operation</i> for us.

36:56.465 --> 36:57.800
Be careful,
don't touch the sides!

36:57.925 --> 36:59.010
Stop it!
Stop messing with him!

36:59.093 --> 37:00.094
What? So?

37:00.177 --> 37:01.387
This is not
good for business.

37:01.470 --> 37:03.472
We don't want
a stressed kidney.

37:03.556 --> 37:04.724
Oh, you think
he's freaked out now?

37:04.807 --> 37:07.226
Wait till we cut him open
and his guts spill out
onto the bed,

37:07.310 --> 37:09.353
like a fucking piÃ±ata
full of garbage.

37:09.437 --> 37:11.063
He's probably gonna
be screaming, too.

37:11.147 --> 37:12.231
Ah! And crying.

37:12.315 --> 37:14.317
You're being a real
fucking bitch about this, man.

37:14.400 --> 37:15.568
Can you imagine
looking down

37:15.651 --> 37:17.320
and just seeing the insides
of your own body?

37:17.403 --> 37:18.905
I mean, right? Just like...

37:18.988 --> 37:20.031
Everything spilling out.

37:20.114 --> 37:21.908
Guts and viscera.
What's viscera?

37:21.991 --> 37:24.351
Viscera is all
the inside stuff that
doesn't even have names.

37:24.744 --> 37:25.828
You're gonna die.

37:25.912 --> 37:27.747
Stop it. Would you
stop messing with him?

37:27.830 --> 37:28.915
What?
You fucking idiot.

37:28.998 --> 37:29.999
Please, please

37:30.082 --> 37:31.167
I love it
when they beg.

37:31.834 --> 37:33.419
Like a tiny baby.
Don't, don't, don't.

37:33.502 --> 37:34.503
Don't do this,
please, please.

37:34.587 --> 37:35.588
I can give you money.
Oh, look at him.

37:35.713 --> 37:37.965
He has so much
raw fear in his eyes.
Yeah.

37:38.049 --> 37:39.759
It's kind of
creeping me out.

37:39.842 --> 37:41.385
Fuck! You can't do this!

37:41.469 --> 37:43.054
You can't do this!
What is that?

37:43.596 --> 37:45.556
No, no, no!
Problem solved.
Look at that.

37:46.432 --> 37:48.935
Hey, buddy? Hey, guy?

37:49.268 --> 37:50.478
Hey, little fella.

37:50.561 --> 37:53.564
Oh, is it a sad day for you?

37:53.648 --> 37:55.608
Look in my eyes.
Look in my eyes.
I don't want to.

37:55.691 --> 37:57.485
Hey, sad eyes, look at me.
Look at me!
I don't want to!

37:57.568 --> 37:58.903
Look at me!

37:58.986 --> 38:00.279
I'm the last face
you're ever gonna see.

38:00.363 --> 38:01.614
Oh, my God!

38:01.739 --> 38:03.616
Okay, buddy.
You hang out here.

38:03.699 --> 38:05.826
We'll be back in
a couple minutes.
We gotta keep prepping.

38:05.910 --> 38:06.953
Stay right there.

38:07.036 --> 38:09.038
You're adorable.
No.

38:11.332 --> 38:12.375
Okay.

38:13.542 --> 38:15.795
You say you're
telepathic, Jason?

38:15.878 --> 38:17.588
Now's your chance
to prove it.

38:17.672 --> 38:19.131
Evan's in trouble.

38:19.215 --> 38:20.383
Find Evan.

38:20.925 --> 38:22.051
Find Evan.

38:22.134 --> 38:23.886
Find Evan!

38:27.223 --> 38:29.266
You shut your mouth
or I'll cut your wiener off

38:29.350 --> 38:30.935
and shove that
in there, okay?

38:31.018 --> 38:32.228
You weirdo.

38:37.233 --> 38:38.526
I love you.

38:41.237 --> 38:44.031
Hey, Evan. Something's
wrong with the card.
The wire didn't go through.

38:44.115 --> 38:45.658
Look, if you're
hooking up with that girl,

38:45.741 --> 38:47.284
I think it's both
awesome and bullshit

38:47.368 --> 38:49.787
'cause Nardo's in trouble,
but that girl was hot.

38:49.870 --> 38:51.330
Oh, wait,
I gotta call you back.

38:51.414 --> 38:52.581
Hey, Pocahontas.

38:53.416 --> 38:54.542
Oh, shit.

38:55.543 --> 38:57.211
What? Well,
it's nice to see you, too.

38:57.294 --> 38:59.255
No, I'm sorry, it's just that
you're the entire reason

38:59.338 --> 39:00.423
I stopped doing shots
with customers.

39:00.506 --> 39:01.507
Please don't
put that on my tray.

39:01.590 --> 39:03.342
No, you know what?
Leave it,
it's already balanced.

39:03.426 --> 39:04.677
You're gonna spill.

39:05.261 --> 39:06.429
Leave me alone.

39:06.804 --> 39:07.805
Don't say that.

39:07.888 --> 39:09.890
Hey, we were two
star-crossed lovers

39:09.974 --> 39:11.350
from different worlds

39:11.434 --> 39:12.768
breaking through generations

39:12.852 --> 39:14.311
of tribal conflict
with our embrace.

39:14.395 --> 39:15.646
So sorry for the gorilla.

39:15.730 --> 39:16.856
Can you go away?

39:17.898 --> 39:18.899
Hi, I'm Jason.

39:20.192 --> 39:22.278
I really do need your help,
though. Honestly.

39:24.613 --> 39:25.656
What?

39:25.740 --> 39:27.199
My friend's missing, okay?

39:27.283 --> 39:30.661
He was in track pants
and an un-ironically
bad T-shirt.

39:30.745 --> 39:32.121
Did you see him?

39:32.204 --> 39:33.748
Of course that
was your friend.

39:33.831 --> 39:35.374
He was a mess.

39:35.458 --> 39:37.334
Wait, what do you mean?
He was trashed.

39:37.418 --> 39:38.502
His girlfriend
was carrying him.

39:38.586 --> 39:39.586
What?

39:39.628 --> 39:40.629
Carrying him?
Mmm-hmm.

39:40.755 --> 39:42.840
Couldn't get
onto the elevator.
Hugo had to help.

39:42.965 --> 39:44.717
That doesn't
make any sense.

39:45.176 --> 39:46.761
Hey, thanks again for this.

39:46.844 --> 39:48.095
Well, this better
not be another ploy

39:48.179 --> 39:49.346
to get me back
into the wave pool.

39:49.430 --> 39:50.431
No, of course not.

39:50.514 --> 39:53.142
That being said,
if something was to
arise organically,

39:53.225 --> 39:55.144
I'm not gonna fight it.
It's not going to.

39:55.978 --> 39:57.813
Hugo. Open up.

40:01.150 --> 40:02.193
What?

40:02.276 --> 40:03.916
Where's that guy that
you brought up here?

40:04.612 --> 40:06.692
I don't know what you mean.
What guy?
There was a guy.

40:06.697 --> 40:09.408
He was wasted
and you loaded him
into the elevator.

40:10.659 --> 40:13.162
Did you hear that?
It sounded like
a tiny, tiny scream.

40:13.913 --> 40:15.206
What are you up to?

40:15.289 --> 40:16.499
Nothing.
I've got a new puppy in here.

40:16.665 --> 40:19.960
I got a tiny
little puppy that I'm...
That I'm training.

40:20.044 --> 40:22.213
Can you just let us in
or show us the puppy?

40:22.296 --> 40:23.964
Either way,
we'll know you're not lying.

40:24.048 --> 40:26.008
Where's the guy?
This conversation is over!

40:26.092 --> 40:29.220
In fact,
I'm gonna hang up this door
like a phone in your face!

40:35.392 --> 40:36.435
Do you hear that?

40:37.186 --> 40:38.187
There it was again.

40:39.688 --> 40:40.856
A tiny, tiny scream.

40:40.940 --> 40:42.274
Like a little woman scream.

40:42.399 --> 40:43.818
Shut up!
Just shut your mouth!

40:43.901 --> 40:45.694
What do we do now?
I have an idea.

40:46.612 --> 40:47.613
Come on.

40:50.157 --> 40:52.243
Okay, well, let's go
downstairs and not
come back up at all.

40:52.326 --> 40:53.327
Shh!

40:56.455 --> 40:58.707
Shut your fat face,
you dumb dildo.

41:11.095 --> 41:12.555
Now what do we do?

41:12.847 --> 41:14.306
Now we dance.

41:16.225 --> 41:17.351
What?

41:20.354 --> 41:21.981
- No, no, wait.
- You're not...

41:22.064 --> 41:23.649
You're...
You're not gonna...

41:24.859 --> 41:25.901
Oh, shit!

41:26.026 --> 41:27.027
That was good.

41:28.445 --> 41:29.613
Beautiful flourish.

41:31.991 --> 41:33.242
Oh, shit.

41:36.912 --> 41:38.038
Which, uh...

41:38.372 --> 41:40.166
Which... On your left leg,
you went first?

41:40.249 --> 41:41.625
It doesn't matter.

41:41.709 --> 41:43.460
Oh, no!

41:45.588 --> 41:47.548
Sorry. You okay?

41:48.090 --> 41:49.758
Get off.

41:57.808 --> 41:58.851
What?

41:59.476 --> 42:00.477
Evan?

42:02.062 --> 42:04.815
Wow, this is some kinky shit.
Did you pay for this?

42:04.899 --> 42:06.275
What is this,
like a doctor thing?

42:06.358 --> 42:09.236
Are you in a spanking position
or are you doing butt stuff?

42:09.320 --> 42:10.905
Jason! Jason!
What?

42:13.866 --> 42:14.909
Shh!

42:14.992 --> 42:15.993
They drugged me.

42:16.118 --> 42:17.536
They drugged me.
My whole body is numb.
Shush.

42:17.620 --> 42:18.746
Who is that?
Who just told me to shush?

42:18.829 --> 42:20.206
Hey, that's Pocahontas.
We used to date...

42:20.289 --> 42:22.124
I mean, not date, but...

42:27.087 --> 42:28.297
Pull his pants up,
let's go!

42:29.048 --> 42:30.299
Pull my pants up!

42:30.382 --> 42:31.550
Again. Again.
Am I farting?

42:31.634 --> 42:33.093
Am I farting?
I can't tell.

42:35.638 --> 42:37.389
Shit! Shit!

42:37.473 --> 42:39.225
Jason,
I'm not good with heights!

42:39.308 --> 42:40.309
Okay.

42:41.560 --> 42:43.229
Ready?
Now you're gonna
tip him towards me.

42:43.312 --> 42:44.312
Mmm-mmm.

42:44.355 --> 42:45.940
Okay, she's gonna tip you
and I'm gonna grab your arm.

42:46.023 --> 42:48.192
When she does that,
you throw your arms out
like a baby alligator,

42:48.275 --> 42:50.527
and use your weak muscles.
I'll grab your arms.
Ready on three.

42:50.611 --> 42:52.613
One, two, three!

42:55.324 --> 42:56.408
No, no, no.

42:56.492 --> 42:57.492
Oh, no, no, no, no!

42:57.534 --> 42:58.911
I got you!
Pull me up.

42:58.994 --> 43:00.474
I've got you!
I've got you!
Pull me up!

43:00.537 --> 43:02.373
Pull him up! Come on!

43:02.456 --> 43:04.041
Hold me!
You're not even squeezing!

43:04.124 --> 43:05.251
I'm fucking paralyzed!

43:05.334 --> 43:06.614
This has gotta be
a joint effort!

43:06.627 --> 43:08.170
Oh, my God! Shit! Shit!

43:08.254 --> 43:10.256
You have to squeeze,
God damn it!

43:10.339 --> 43:11.924
- Pull me up!
- No, no.

43:12.007 --> 43:13.926
Oh, no, no!
He's slipping. Slipping.

43:15.135 --> 43:17.179
Pull him up!
Evan! Evan!

43:17.263 --> 43:18.514
Get his hand!
No, no.

43:18.597 --> 43:20.057
No, no, no, no.

43:26.981 --> 43:28.148
Evan?

43:35.322 --> 43:36.699
Oh, shit!

43:47.376 --> 43:48.377
Jason?

43:49.003 --> 43:50.004
Evan!

44:03.225 --> 44:04.518
What are you doing?
They're gone!

44:04.601 --> 44:06.270
We need to pack our stuff
and get out of here.

44:06.353 --> 44:07.479
You really are
telepathic, Jason!

44:07.563 --> 44:08.647
Yeah, I know that.

44:08.731 --> 44:09.940
Here, you relax.

44:10.024 --> 44:11.191
Oh, shit.
Oh, God, no.

44:11.275 --> 44:12.818
In terrible odds,
you did it again,

44:12.901 --> 44:14.820
I wanted you to pick me up
and you read my mind.

44:14.903 --> 44:16.488
Stay right there.
Thank you.

44:16.572 --> 44:17.990
I didn't realize
that you were...

44:18.407 --> 44:19.783
God, you're an idiot!

44:24.038 --> 44:25.581
Oh, shit.
Is everybody okay?

44:26.165 --> 44:27.583
Yeah, I'm good.

44:28.751 --> 44:30.377
Oh, no!

44:32.212 --> 44:33.339
What? What is it?

44:33.422 --> 44:34.631
Can you feel this?

44:34.715 --> 44:36.008
Can I feel what?

44:36.091 --> 44:37.091
Um...

44:37.134 --> 44:38.135
Okay.

44:40.888 --> 44:42.139
Is everybody okay up there?

44:42.598 --> 44:43.918
Something happened.
What happened?

44:43.932 --> 44:45.517
Nothing. There was a Cinnabon
with ants on it.

44:45.601 --> 44:46.852
Oh, yeah,
those can be gross.

44:49.229 --> 44:51.510
All right, I think he's gone.
I gotta take him to the car.

44:51.523 --> 44:52.858
I'll help.
No, no, no.

44:52.941 --> 44:55.861
You've done enough.
This is our battle to fight.

44:56.445 --> 44:57.780
Goodbye, Pocahontas.

44:58.447 --> 44:59.448
Goodbye.

45:09.792 --> 45:12.378
You know my name
isn't really Pocahontas,
right?

45:12.961 --> 45:14.004
Yeah.

45:14.546 --> 45:16.548
So say my name.

45:17.883 --> 45:19.134
Say it.

45:20.344 --> 45:21.387
Shlerin?

45:21.720 --> 45:23.138
What?

45:23.222 --> 45:25.474
Shlerin? It's not?

45:29.728 --> 45:31.313
Nice to meet you,
Shlerin.

45:36.068 --> 45:37.778
I think I might've
gone to the bathroom.

45:37.861 --> 45:39.571
Can you just wait
till we get to the car?

45:39.655 --> 45:41.865
I am Hugo!
Uh-oh.

45:45.202 --> 45:46.453
Who is this guy?

45:46.537 --> 45:48.163
He's the Amazing Hugo.

45:48.539 --> 45:51.166
And he's an expert
marksman and magician.

45:54.586 --> 45:56.255
I'm going to
the bathroom again.

45:58.006 --> 45:59.466
Eat shit, dickhead.

46:05.180 --> 46:06.306
What happened to the car?

46:06.390 --> 46:07.474
Is the car okay?

46:07.558 --> 46:09.101
I think we can
buff that out.

46:22.739 --> 46:24.241
Wait, do you smell that?

46:24.700 --> 46:25.701
I can't breathe.

46:26.827 --> 46:28.662
Do you smell something?

46:33.459 --> 46:34.710
Get out of the way!

46:51.393 --> 46:53.479
Oh, my God,
are you okay?

46:53.562 --> 46:55.230
My whole body is numb.

46:55.522 --> 46:58.025
Is there any blood?
Do you see any blood?

47:02.488 --> 47:05.407
Oh, shit.
This car is on fire.
Uh, run!

47:05.491 --> 47:06.909
Run, run, run!

47:06.992 --> 47:08.494
Run, run, run!

47:14.124 --> 47:15.459
Evan?

47:17.336 --> 47:18.545
Jason?

47:18.629 --> 47:19.755
Evan, run!

47:22.424 --> 47:23.592
Oh, there he is!

47:25.344 --> 47:26.595
Atta boy!

47:27.429 --> 47:29.014
You're doing great!

47:29.097 --> 47:31.975
Don't be self-conscious!
Just waddle towards me!

47:32.059 --> 47:35.062
That's my little penguin!
Keep waddling! Faster!

47:36.104 --> 47:37.272
That's a penguin!

47:37.356 --> 47:38.482
I'm doing it!

47:38.565 --> 47:40.484
That's a penguin!

47:41.818 --> 47:43.779
Jason! Come get me!

47:43.862 --> 47:47.115
Does it seem like
it's gonna explode,
like, right now or...

47:47.199 --> 47:48.242
Come get me, Jason!

47:48.325 --> 47:49.326
Okay!

47:50.244 --> 47:51.453
All right, here.

48:24.653 --> 48:26.029
Where's my money?
Huh?

48:26.113 --> 48:27.656
I'm sorry.
It didn't go through.

48:27.739 --> 48:29.992
Bullshit! I signed my name,
just like you said!

48:30.075 --> 48:31.618
Well, maybe I can
send you a check.

48:31.702 --> 48:33.161
Or do you have
a PayPal account?

48:33.245 --> 48:35.122
Fuck you!
Give me your wig!

48:35.205 --> 48:37.457
This is my real hair.

48:37.916 --> 48:39.209
You got money somewhere.
Ow!

48:40.919 --> 48:42.254
You got money
in those tights!

48:42.337 --> 48:44.089
My tights?
I don't have anything
in these tights.

48:44.172 --> 48:45.549
I have no money!
Don't play me.

48:45.632 --> 48:47.926
Jesus! I don't have anything.
Please, this is all I have.

48:48.010 --> 48:49.177
There's no money
in here, I swear.

48:49.261 --> 48:50.304
Give me the tights!

48:50.387 --> 48:51.430
No! Ow!

48:52.514 --> 48:53.640
What the... No!

48:54.891 --> 48:56.977
What are you doing?
No! No!

48:57.436 --> 48:59.146
See?
There's nothing in there!

48:59.229 --> 49:00.230
Are you happy?

49:03.900 --> 49:05.777
This man is attacking me!

49:05.861 --> 49:07.279
No, I'm not!
I'm not attacking her!

49:07.362 --> 49:09.562
Don't climb the fence!
You don't need to
climb the fence!

49:14.911 --> 49:15.912
Out of the way!

50:07.422 --> 50:10.183
Oh, fuck! Hey, don't shoot me!
Don't shoot me! Oh, God,
don't shoot me!

50:12.052 --> 50:14.680
Please, this was
an accident. Okay?
I didn't mean to be here.

50:14.763 --> 50:16.515
No, no, no! Okay, look.

50:16.598 --> 50:19.434
I will pay you back
for all the cocaine I snorted!

50:19.518 --> 50:21.478
And you should know,
good job on you guys.

50:21.561 --> 50:25.190
You have an amazing product!
It's good energy, it's smooth.

50:25.273 --> 50:28.193
It's speedy,
but it's not jumpy, okay?
It's what I would call

50:28.276 --> 50:29.528
a sweet-ass high.

50:29.611 --> 50:31.279
I know for a fact
that it's harder

50:31.363 --> 50:32.989
to kill someone if
you know them, okay?

50:33.073 --> 50:34.783
So here's some things
you might not know about me.

50:34.866 --> 50:37.577
My name is Daniel Narducci.
Everyone calls me Nardo.

50:37.661 --> 50:40.706
I'm allergic to penicillin.
I love this little girl
called Tracy.

50:40.789 --> 50:42.249
She's a hot little number,

50:42.332 --> 50:44.626
and she fucking dishes it out
anytime she wants.

50:49.715 --> 50:51.383
...and she goes
to Dave & Buster's,
we both go,

50:51.466 --> 50:52.843
and play arcade games,
all of them.

50:52.926 --> 50:55.387
Pinball, <i>Time Crisis II</i>
with all the popping
up and down,

50:55.470 --> 50:56.555
and all of those shooter...

50:56.638 --> 50:59.099
I'm not shooting you,
it's fake. It's... It's fake.

50:59.182 --> 51:01.059
And she wears vegan shoes,
that's cute.

51:01.143 --> 51:02.894
What?

51:03.228 --> 51:05.272
I can't understand you.

51:05.355 --> 51:06.773
No, no, I'm not
going down there.

51:08.233 --> 51:09.860
Down! Okay, I got it!

51:16.742 --> 51:17.826
It's all back.

51:18.326 --> 51:20.078
Look, here's some more things.
Here's some more things.

51:20.162 --> 51:22.122
I hope to one day be
a licensed reseller

51:22.205 --> 51:23.498
of above-ground
Jacuzzis, right?

51:23.582 --> 51:26.084
They're called Jacuzzis,
I'm called Nardo,

51:26.168 --> 51:27.586
and together
they're Narduzzis.

51:27.669 --> 51:30.797
"Come over to Narduzzi's
and we'll wade in
the warm water."

51:30.881 --> 51:32.081
Like, "Welcome to Narduzzi's."

51:47.856 --> 51:50.776
<i>Could you just</i>
<i>please tell MacDonaldson</i>
<i>I am sorry I missed the steam,</i>

51:50.859 --> 51:52.319
<i>but I will be at the meeting.
I promise.</i>

51:52.402 --> 51:54.446
Did you try to take
out a cash advance
on the company card

51:54.529 --> 51:56.990
at an Indian casino
at 3:00 this morning?

51:57.073 --> 51:58.200
How do you know that?
Wait.

51:59.409 --> 52:01.169
This is MacDonaldson.
I'm gonna patch you in.

52:01.203 --> 52:02.287
No, no,
don't patch in MacDonaldson.

52:02.370 --> 52:03.830
<i>Evan?</i>
Hello, sir.

52:03.914 --> 52:05.832
<i>I am so sorry</i>
<i>I missed the steam</i>
<i>this morning, but I...</i>

52:05.916 --> 52:07.292
Did you try to take
out a cash advance

52:07.375 --> 52:08.752
on the company card
at 3:00 a.m.?

52:08.835 --> 52:12.172
I didn't want to
get into this with you
so quickly, but the...

52:12.255 --> 52:14.549
The truth is
I was out all night
with the Nakatomi guys.

52:14.633 --> 52:16.343
<i>You know me,
all about the hustle.</i>

52:16.426 --> 52:18.887
And these Japanese businessmen
like to party.

52:18.970 --> 52:20.430
<i>Just like the stereotype.</i>

52:20.555 --> 52:23.225
I like this one.
Can you make her feet smaller?

52:23.308 --> 52:24.351
Oh, Jesus Christ.

52:24.434 --> 52:26.686
Evan, it's one thing
to chase new business

52:26.770 --> 52:29.231
and it's another thing
to blow a presentation
with our biggest client.

52:29.314 --> 52:30.357
I know. I'm sorry, sir.

52:30.440 --> 52:33.652
Now, you listen here.
You be here at 2:00.

52:33.735 --> 52:35.445
And, Evan,

52:35.529 --> 52:37.447
this is your last chance.

52:37.531 --> 52:38.907
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

52:40.700 --> 52:41.827
Thank you for that.

52:41.910 --> 52:43.620
Face it, Evan,
you're kind of
at a turning point.

52:43.703 --> 52:45.497
Pretty soon,
you're gonna become
one of those drones

52:45.580 --> 52:47.500
that goes to lunch
and asks if they
have boba tea.

52:47.582 --> 52:48.834
You're gonna
drink boba tea.

52:48.917 --> 52:50.335
Okay, despite what
you may think,

52:50.418 --> 52:52.212
I actually love
what I do.

52:52.420 --> 52:53.839
You think I'm a failure?

52:53.922 --> 52:57.342
Look in the mirror, pal.
Your life is a joke
on every level.

52:57.425 --> 52:58.593
You know what?
Say what you want,

52:58.677 --> 53:00.011
but at least
I care about my friends.

53:00.095 --> 53:01.680
Is that why you
destroyed Nardo's life?

53:01.763 --> 53:03.765
Hey, he shouldn't marry Tracy
and you know it.

53:03.849 --> 53:06.059
You're just afraid to
admit it because you're
a fucking coward!

53:06.142 --> 53:07.519
Okay.

53:07.602 --> 53:09.104
I'm a coward?
Yeah, you are.

53:09.187 --> 53:12.357
You know, it's not easy
to stop a wedding.
And I had to do it alone.

53:12.440 --> 53:13.984
I could've used
your help, friend.

53:14.067 --> 53:16.862
The only reason
you don't want Nardo
to get married is

53:16.945 --> 53:18.280
'cause you don't wanna
lose your friend.

53:18.363 --> 53:19.447
That's not true.

53:19.531 --> 53:21.783
Everybody's
moving on without you.
Boo-hoo!

53:21.950 --> 53:23.326
Grow the fuck up!

53:23.410 --> 53:25.412
What, so you're saying
now I have to like Tracy?

53:25.495 --> 53:27.914
No. You have to
love Tracy.

53:30.792 --> 53:33.336
Hey, you boys didn't happen
to blow up a car

53:33.420 --> 53:35.213
and leave the scene
of an accident, did you?

53:35.297 --> 53:37.299
We didn't leave...
Blow up, like explode?

53:37.382 --> 53:39.302
Yeah, we don't know
anything about a Ford Taurus.

53:41.303 --> 53:42.512
Hey, please, please,

53:42.596 --> 53:44.973
don't stuff my
corpse with drugs
and send it to my Grammy!

53:47.642 --> 53:49.185
What the fuck?

54:00.196 --> 54:02.616
What? What are we...
What are we doing now?

54:26.014 --> 54:28.016
How you doing? I'm Berk.

54:28.558 --> 54:29.935
Put it there.

54:30.018 --> 54:31.436
I'm tied.
These guys tied me up.

54:31.519 --> 54:34.022
A man come in your house
and can't shake
your fucking hand?

54:34.105 --> 54:35.357
Motherfucker, I'm Berk!

54:35.440 --> 54:36.650
They tied me up.

54:36.733 --> 54:38.276
We got a problem.

54:39.069 --> 54:42.113
We got big <i>problemo.</i>

54:43.031 --> 54:45.951
That shit was supposed to be
in South Padre tomorrow.

54:46.034 --> 54:47.285
But instead,

54:47.369 --> 54:49.704
it's caked to
somebody's balls.

54:49.788 --> 54:52.832
Not his balls,
not his balls,
not my balls.

54:53.208 --> 54:54.376
Your balls.

54:54.459 --> 54:57.337
You can't wear
a man's cocaine around.

54:57.420 --> 54:59.005
I'm about sick of this shit.
Give me your gun.

54:59.089 --> 55:00.924
Oh, no.
Oh, no?

55:01.007 --> 55:02.300
Oh, yes, motherfucker.

55:02.384 --> 55:03.718
Please don't! Please don't!

55:04.552 --> 55:06.596
Want my vest?
You want it?

55:06.721 --> 55:08.890
What?
You want my vest?

55:08.974 --> 55:11.017
Protect yourself?
Yeah, yeah, please.

55:11.101 --> 55:12.602
Oh, fucking Christ!

55:13.019 --> 55:14.896
Your hair went up
in the back. Your hair
said, "Whoo-whoo!"

55:15.271 --> 55:17.482
Okay, look.
Look, Berk. Mr. Berk.

55:17.565 --> 55:19.651
Mr. Berk,
I'm... I'm sorry.

55:25.365 --> 55:26.992
You are not fucking Spanish.

55:27.075 --> 55:28.952
We are fucking Spanish.

55:29.369 --> 55:30.578
You're Spanish?

55:30.662 --> 55:34.332
You have the fucking guts
to question if I'm Spanish?

55:34.416 --> 55:36.835
You just don't...
You don't have
a Spanish quality about you.

55:37.544 --> 55:40.005
<i>Uno, dos, tres,</i>
motherfucker!

55:41.423 --> 55:43.633
Okay. Sorry.
Normal "sorry."

55:52.267 --> 55:54.185
Sucks they took our phones.

55:54.269 --> 55:56.813
Is my ass bleeding?
Um...

55:57.814 --> 55:59.774
Evan, a lot of things
happened today...

55:59.858 --> 56:01.651
Your bail's been posted.

56:01.776 --> 56:03.028
Really?

56:03.987 --> 56:05.822
Do we get our phones back?
We'll see.

56:05.905 --> 56:07.745
I just wanna say
I've learned
a valuable lesson.

56:07.782 --> 56:09.701
Yeah, don't,
don't touch me.

56:12.328 --> 56:15.040
You do realize you've
put me in a ridiculous
position here, right?

56:15.123 --> 56:16.916
Yes, I'm sorry,
but I appreciate
everything you've done.

56:17.000 --> 56:18.877
We have a meeting
in three hours.

56:18.960 --> 56:20.962
Were you really not gonna
tell me you were on
your way to Mexico?

56:21.046 --> 56:22.714
I had everything
under control.

56:22.797 --> 56:23.798
You're an idiot.

56:23.882 --> 56:27.052
So, what's the plan now,
boys? You guys gonna
walk down to Mexico?

56:27.135 --> 56:28.428
She's right.
We should borrow her car.

56:28.511 --> 56:30.055
Not gonna happen!

56:30.138 --> 56:32.557
Wait, we just need
to get down there and
then we'll get right back.

56:32.640 --> 56:34.100
Down where exactly?

56:34.184 --> 56:36.102
Tracy's on her honeymoon
right now in Mexico.

56:36.186 --> 56:38.438
Nardo said he was gonna
do everything in his power
to get down there.

56:38.521 --> 56:40.440
So all we have to do
is go down to Mexico,

56:40.523 --> 56:43.568
keep our heads on a swivel,
and rescue Nardo.

56:43.651 --> 56:45.612
Yeah, you can take
the Tijuana Trolley.

56:45.695 --> 56:46.946
It makes a stop
in Los Angeles.

56:46.988 --> 56:49.908
"Take the trolley."
That's their slogan.
Mmm-hmm.

56:49.991 --> 56:51.785
It's on the front.
Well, I never rode it.

56:51.868 --> 56:53.912
No.
But it's reliable,
I've heard.

56:54.245 --> 56:55.914
I'm sorry, guys.

56:55.997 --> 56:57.290
You owe me $900
in court fees.

56:57.373 --> 56:58.625
Wait, wait, wait.

56:59.334 --> 57:01.134
There is something
I need you to do, actually.

57:01.169 --> 57:02.545
Do you think you could
run back in there,

57:02.629 --> 57:05.924
and get this
stamped and processed
on the second floor?

57:06.007 --> 57:08.009
I'm adding this
to your bill.

57:11.137 --> 57:12.514
Let's go.
Where'd you get those?

57:12.597 --> 57:14.037
I took them from her purse.
I had to!

57:14.057 --> 57:16.017
You drive.
I'm sliding across the hood.

57:19.104 --> 57:20.355
Whoo-hoo!

57:21.606 --> 57:23.316
No, no. No, no!

57:23.733 --> 57:24.901
Hey!

57:24.984 --> 57:27.779
My fucking laptop
is in there!

57:27.862 --> 57:29.239
My laptop's in there!

57:29.322 --> 57:31.616
I'm sorry! I had to!

57:31.699 --> 57:33.201
Here, here!
Soft landing!

57:37.038 --> 57:38.373
Idiots!

57:43.711 --> 57:46.172
I say we fill
his corpse with drugs

57:46.256 --> 57:48.049
and send it back
to his Grammy!

57:48.133 --> 57:49.259
Wait a minute, man.

57:49.342 --> 57:50.844
You're gonna fill
a body up with drugs

57:50.927 --> 57:52.387
and send it to
someone's Grammy?

57:56.766 --> 58:00.061
Grammies are
good for apple pies
and tucking you in bed.

58:00.145 --> 58:02.647
And... And breast-feeding you
when your mom's not around!

58:02.730 --> 58:04.149
You don't do that
to a Grammy!

58:04.649 --> 58:06.693
We don't do that
to Grammies!

58:09.737 --> 58:10.780
Let me tell you something.

58:10.864 --> 58:14.325
This motherfucker right here
works for Chucho.

58:22.750 --> 58:24.127
What's he doing?

58:24.794 --> 58:26.254
What the fuck you doing?

58:36.431 --> 58:37.473
Oh...

58:42.896 --> 58:43.896
Oh, shit!

58:43.938 --> 58:45.273
Shit, shit, shit!

58:45.356 --> 58:46.524
Fuck!

58:58.203 --> 58:59.603
Ahh! Don't shoot me!
Don't shoot me!

59:11.299 --> 59:13.218
I'm out. I'm out!

59:13.801 --> 59:17.472
Whoo! Yeah! Yes! Yes!

59:17.555 --> 59:18.890
Whoo!

59:18.973 --> 59:20.808
Where am I going?

59:20.892 --> 59:22.310
Fucker!

59:23.561 --> 59:24.812
Hold on.

59:25.438 --> 59:26.689
Why's he coming back?

59:27.148 --> 59:28.566
Tracy, here I come!

59:28.650 --> 59:30.318
Yeah, I made it,
motherfuckers!

59:30.401 --> 59:32.320
We're gonna
get married, Tracy!

59:32.820 --> 59:35.531
Whoo! Yeah!
I fucking won, baby!

59:36.658 --> 59:38.660
Don't stop loving me!

59:40.328 --> 59:41.496
I won!

59:41.788 --> 59:42.914
Yes!

59:42.997 --> 59:44.332
Fuck you, Berk!

59:49.629 --> 59:51.965
Oh, shit. I'm sorry.

01:00:12.193 --> 01:00:14.195
Okay, I need a map.

01:00:23.955 --> 01:00:26.165
Okay. Wow. I'm high.

01:00:45.351 --> 01:00:46.352
What's this?

01:00:47.562 --> 01:00:49.897
Okay, that's the highway!
Okay, okay, okay!

01:00:49.981 --> 01:00:51.357
Indicator!

01:00:51.441 --> 01:00:53.234
I'm coming for you, Tracy!

01:00:53.318 --> 01:00:54.902
I'm coming for you!

01:01:07.498 --> 01:01:09.751
This thing fits pretty good,
but I don't know,

01:01:09.834 --> 01:01:11.044
feels like there's
a lot going on, doesn't it?

01:01:11.127 --> 01:01:13.463
Oh, let me see it,
turn around.
Yeah, buddy, that's fire.

01:01:13.546 --> 01:01:14.630
That's iguana fire.

01:01:14.714 --> 01:01:16.090
My treat.
I'm paying for it.

01:01:16.174 --> 01:01:17.175
I already paid for it.

01:01:17.258 --> 01:01:18.634
I'll pay you back
when we get home.

01:01:19.260 --> 01:01:20.887
That's not a treat.
Okay.

01:01:22.388 --> 01:01:24.724
Let's ride.
Let's do this.

01:01:29.437 --> 01:01:31.773
Where is Nardo?
He should've
been here by now.

01:01:31.856 --> 01:01:34.776
I mean,
the least attractive
girl here is an eight,

01:01:34.859 --> 01:01:36.694
and that's only because
she's wearing a neck brace.

01:01:36.778 --> 01:01:39.197
Hey, hey! Head in the game.
We're looking for our friend.

01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:40.760
Look, look. Look,
she's looking at me.

01:01:40.823 --> 01:01:42.241
She can't move her head.

01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:44.077
Now she's looking at me.

01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:45.453
No, she's not.

01:01:49.707 --> 01:01:50.750
Jason!
Okay.

01:01:52.293 --> 01:01:53.878
That's enough lotion,
thank you.

01:01:56.297 --> 01:01:58.466
Tracy. Tracy.

01:01:58.549 --> 01:01:59.550
Evan?

01:02:01.677 --> 01:02:03.054
How'd you two get here?

01:02:03.137 --> 01:02:04.722
Primarily by smart car.

01:02:04.806 --> 01:02:07.433
Have you talked to Nardo?
No!

01:02:07.517 --> 01:02:10.353
We broke up because
of you two assholes.

01:02:10.436 --> 01:02:12.480
Or did you forget that?
Tracy...

01:02:12.563 --> 01:02:14.357
Do you have any idea
what it feels like

01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:16.776
to be stood up and humiliated
at your own wedding?

01:02:17.610 --> 01:02:20.196
My life is a disaster
because of you two.

01:02:20.279 --> 01:02:24.450
What happened was a mistake,
and Nardo feels really
bad and he loves you.

01:02:24.534 --> 01:02:25.785
Oh, my God.

01:02:27.703 --> 01:02:28.996
Tracy.

01:02:29.330 --> 01:02:30.581
Tracy.

01:02:31.457 --> 01:02:33.084
Tracy.

01:02:33.167 --> 01:02:34.210
Tracy.
What?

01:02:34.293 --> 01:02:36.337
Tracy, wait.
Why are you fighting for me?

01:02:36.421 --> 01:02:38.089
You don't even like me.

01:02:38.589 --> 01:02:39.966
I like you.
No, you don't.

01:02:40.341 --> 01:02:43.678
If you liked me,
you never would've let
Jason go through with that.

01:02:43.970 --> 01:02:45.763
Fine. You know what?

01:02:45.847 --> 01:02:48.266
I should've
stopped him. Okay?

01:02:48.349 --> 01:02:50.643
I guess I didn't
because part of me thought

01:02:50.726 --> 01:02:52.326
that Jason might've
been right about you.

01:02:52.478 --> 01:02:53.980
But things are
different now.

01:02:54.063 --> 01:02:57.191
I never knew how
much Nardo loved you.
But I do now.

01:02:57.275 --> 01:03:00.319
Nardo believes in you.
He's on his way here
right now, I promise.

01:03:01.237 --> 01:03:03.448
Tell him I said goodbye.

01:03:03.990 --> 01:03:05.366
Tracy!

01:03:09.871 --> 01:03:10.997
Shit.

01:03:15.626 --> 01:03:18.504
I'm coming for you, Tracy!
I'm coming for you!

01:03:19.881 --> 01:03:21.257
How do I turn this off?

01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:25.720
God, that's loud! That's loud!
Why is it so loud?

01:03:28.139 --> 01:03:30.224
Shut the fuck up! God!

01:03:36.397 --> 01:03:38.316
Fuck! Oh, my God!

01:03:41.152 --> 01:03:42.945
Oh! Ahh! Ow!

01:03:47.742 --> 01:03:50.578
Hi. I'm checking out
of the honeymoon suite.

01:04:12.183 --> 01:04:14.727
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. Was that your...

01:04:16.896 --> 01:04:17.897
Tracy?

01:04:20.441 --> 01:04:22.860
Tracy! Tracy!

01:04:24.028 --> 01:04:25.196
Tracy!

01:04:36.123 --> 01:04:38.292
<i>Mr. MacDonaldson,
you have a call on line one.</i>

01:04:39.627 --> 01:04:41.629
Hello?
Sir, hi. It's Evan.

01:04:41.712 --> 01:04:42.964
Evan, where are you?

01:04:43.047 --> 01:04:44.799
<i>The presentation
has been moved to 5:00,</i>

01:04:44.882 --> 01:04:47.718
so that gives us three hours
till we have to get it
together to present.

01:04:47.802 --> 01:04:49.220
<i>Sir, Elizabeth on two.</i>

01:04:49.303 --> 01:04:50.638
Hold on, this is
Elizabeth calling now.

01:04:50.721 --> 01:04:51.722
Let me see if I
can patch her in.

01:04:51.806 --> 01:04:52.807
Oh, don't do that.

01:04:52.890 --> 01:04:54.267
Hello, Elizabeth.
Did this work?

01:04:54.517 --> 01:04:56.894
<i>Hello?</i>
Evan?

01:04:56.978 --> 01:04:58.396
Hey, Elizabeth.

01:04:58.479 --> 01:05:00.398
Evan, I'd very much
like to speak to you

01:05:00.481 --> 01:05:02.733
face to face about our
transportation issue.

01:05:02.817 --> 01:05:06.028
Right. I very much
would like to thank you
for all that you have... Oh.

01:05:07.321 --> 01:05:09.241
I'm sorry, I'm getting a call.
It's an emergency.

01:05:09.323 --> 01:05:11.742
No one is hanging up
until I know exactly
what's going on.

01:05:11.826 --> 01:05:14.453
I'm sorry, sir.
It's an emergency,
I have to go.

01:05:14.537 --> 01:05:16.038
I'll see you at 5:00.

01:05:16.122 --> 01:05:17.122
- Hello?
<i>- Evan!</i>

01:05:17.164 --> 01:05:18.457
Nardo! Where are you?

01:05:18.541 --> 01:05:20.585
I'm in a fucking
Mexican jail, man!

01:05:20.668 --> 01:05:22.753
What?
I'm in a Mexican jail.

01:05:22.837 --> 01:05:24.088
<i>Hello?</i>

01:05:24.171 --> 01:05:25.965
Wait. Now, who's this?

01:05:26.048 --> 01:05:27.425
<i>Sir?</i>
Who's on the line?

01:05:27.508 --> 01:05:30.595
It's fucking Nardo and
I'm in a Mexican jail!
Who the fuck is this?

01:05:30.678 --> 01:05:33.681
Okay, Nardo,
if you could please hang up
and call me back...

01:05:33.764 --> 01:05:35.933
Are you kidding me?
They're only giving me
one phone call here!

01:05:36.017 --> 01:05:37.059
I'm a dead man!

01:05:37.143 --> 01:05:39.937
These fucking phones.
Elizabeth,
what line are you on?

01:05:40.021 --> 01:05:41.147
- I'm here...
<i>- Nardo,</i>

01:05:41.230 --> 01:05:43.274
uh, tell me which jail
you are in right now.

01:05:43.357 --> 01:05:45.276
Sir, if you could
just please hang up.

01:05:45.359 --> 01:05:47.987
Do not fucking...
Do not hang up
on me, Evan!

01:05:48.070 --> 01:05:49.947
Elizabeth?
Nardo, which jail
are you in?

01:05:50.031 --> 01:05:51.699
My poncho says
"Rosarito 17" on it.

01:05:51.782 --> 01:05:53.117
Okay, great!

01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:54.520
<i>Evan!</i>
Okay, we will be there soon!

01:05:54.535 --> 01:05:56.662
There's someone's blood
on this phone, Evan!

01:05:56.746 --> 01:05:58.226
- Sir, I will see you at 5:00.
<i>- Okay.</i>

01:05:58.289 --> 01:05:59.449
No, no, no, no!
Wait a minute!

01:05:59.498 --> 01:06:00.625
Evan, you're the man!

01:06:00.708 --> 01:06:01.792
<i>Do not hang up on me, Evan!</i>

01:06:08.215 --> 01:06:09.508
Hello?

01:06:09.592 --> 01:06:10.635
<i>Hello?</i>

01:06:11.427 --> 01:06:13.054
Hey, hi.
<i>Who's this?</i>

01:06:13.137 --> 01:06:14.388
Well, who are you?

01:06:14.472 --> 01:06:16.182
This is Kyle MacDonaldson.

01:06:16.265 --> 01:06:18.684
You've got a great
speaking voice.
Are you black?

01:06:18.768 --> 01:06:20.353
<i>What's that...
What's that like?</i>

01:06:20.436 --> 01:06:22.229
Nice meeting you!

01:06:28.736 --> 01:06:30.176
<i>Hey, what's up?
You've reached Tracy.</i>

01:06:30.237 --> 01:06:31.405
<i>If you'd like to
leave a message,</i>

01:06:31.489 --> 01:06:34.450
<i>feel free to do so while I
drink margaritas. What?</i>

01:06:34.533 --> 01:06:36.661
Tracy, it's Evan.
I know you're pissed.

01:06:36.744 --> 01:06:40.373
It's just...
Nardo is in serious trouble,

01:06:41.165 --> 01:06:43.417
and we're at
the police station,
Rosarito 17.

01:06:44.460 --> 01:06:47.463
We really need your help
and your credit card.
Thank you.

01:06:47.922 --> 01:06:50.925
Should we save
the donkey, too?
I like you.

01:06:51.759 --> 01:06:53.511
This is so crazy.

01:06:53.594 --> 01:06:55.596
How are we gonna get
Nardo out of here?

01:06:55.680 --> 01:06:57.181
I don't know.
Maybe we bribe them?

01:06:57.264 --> 01:06:59.058
Mexican cops don't
make a lot of money,

01:06:59.141 --> 01:07:01.560
so they'd for sure
go for a bribe.

01:07:03.354 --> 01:07:04.605
What is that?

01:07:04.689 --> 01:07:06.357
It's a stick,
in case we need it in there.

01:07:07.108 --> 01:07:08.859
We are not breaking Nardo
out of a Mexican jail

01:07:08.943 --> 01:07:11.070
with fucking sticks.

01:07:11.153 --> 01:07:13.489
We'll run game on them.
Let's do the "we got beef."

01:07:13.948 --> 01:07:16.367
No, we are not gonna
do the "we got beef."

01:07:16.450 --> 01:07:17.970
Why not? It works.
It doesn't even work

01:07:18.035 --> 01:07:19.662
on drunk girls
on spring break.

01:07:19.745 --> 01:07:20.996
It worked at Arizona State.

01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:22.790
Everything works
at Arizona State.

01:07:22.873 --> 01:07:24.291
That's true.

01:07:25.292 --> 01:07:27.420
Can I get
a Diet Coke, please?

01:07:27.503 --> 01:07:29.130
You probably
don't even have diet!

01:07:31.882 --> 01:07:33.634
Animals!

01:07:34.969 --> 01:07:36.262
Excuse us, gentlemen.

01:07:36.345 --> 01:07:38.973
Do you have a prisoner here
by the name of Nardo?

01:07:39.056 --> 01:07:41.058
Daniel Narducci,
maybe you booked him under?

01:07:41.142 --> 01:07:43.519
Evan! Jason!
Oh, thank God you're here!

01:07:43.602 --> 01:07:45.104
Nardo! Nardo!
Nardo! Nardo!

01:07:45.187 --> 01:07:46.313
No, no, no!

01:07:46.397 --> 01:07:47.523
Hey, man!

01:07:47.606 --> 01:07:48.649
Behind the line.

01:07:49.108 --> 01:07:51.235
Yeah, there's a chalk
line, Evan.
Evan!

01:07:51.318 --> 01:07:54.071
Jason! These two
have been torturing me!

01:07:54.155 --> 01:07:55.906
We haven't been
torturing you.

01:07:55.990 --> 01:07:58.367
Well, he was licking me!

01:07:59.243 --> 01:08:00.953
Have you been licking him?

01:08:03.456 --> 01:08:07.626
I'm so fucked up
right now. Yeah.

01:08:07.710 --> 01:08:09.503
He licked me right here.

01:08:09.587 --> 01:08:10.987
And then he licked
me here and here.

01:08:11.672 --> 01:08:13.924
Look, here's what
we're gonna do.

01:08:14.341 --> 01:08:16.510
You guys are
gonna give us Nardo

01:08:16.594 --> 01:08:18.636
and we will make it
worth your while.

01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:21.015
Yeah. We're gonna bribe you.

01:08:21.098 --> 01:08:22.224
Oh, my God.

01:08:22.308 --> 01:08:24.602
No, we can't do that.
He's part of the deal.

01:08:24.685 --> 01:08:26.812
Berk is on his way over...

01:08:28.814 --> 01:08:30.733
Wait, did you say "Berk"?

01:08:30.816 --> 01:08:31.942
Berk hates me, okay?

01:08:32.026 --> 01:08:33.652
He's after me!

01:08:33.736 --> 01:08:35.029
I stole a truck
full of his cocaine.

01:08:35.112 --> 01:08:36.822
This is all a big
misunderstanding.

01:08:36.906 --> 01:08:38.573
Nardo is not a drug runner.

01:08:38.657 --> 01:08:40.201
I mean, look at him. He...

01:08:40.283 --> 01:08:43.370
He could barely run,
little fella.
Look at me.

01:08:43.996 --> 01:08:47.166
Look at him,
he's a foppish dandy.
He's a fop.

01:08:47.249 --> 01:08:49.460
He's innocent, you know.
He's a little baby.

01:08:49.542 --> 01:08:51.045
Little
<i>Pig in the City.</i>

01:08:51.127 --> 01:08:52.546
Yeah, he's a
<i>Pig in the City.</i>

01:08:52.630 --> 01:08:54.340
Ever seen that
movie? Did you guys get
that down here?

01:08:54.423 --> 01:08:56.801
Yeah, I'm a little Babe.
"That'll do."

01:08:56.884 --> 01:08:58.469
He can talk, the whole thing.

01:08:58.551 --> 01:09:01.305
<i>Pig in the Cities.</i>

01:09:01.471 --> 01:09:03.098
I think we all do.
Yeah.

01:09:03.182 --> 01:09:07.144
I saw
<i>Pigs in the City</i>
on Christmas time.

01:09:07.228 --> 01:09:09.979
Oh, it made my heart
feel warm and...

01:09:10.064 --> 01:09:11.564
I love it so much.

01:09:12.024 --> 01:09:13.651
You ever see
the first one?

01:09:14.568 --> 01:09:16.569
There's a first one?

01:09:17.738 --> 01:09:20.866
Oh, my God,
my life is a lies.

01:09:21.408 --> 01:09:24.787
You know, I think
it's time for you
two guys to leave.

01:09:24.870 --> 01:09:26.205
Before you get hurt.

01:09:26.497 --> 01:09:29.207
I don't know
what you guys are
trying to pull here.

01:09:29.291 --> 01:09:31.836
But the United States,
we come down pretty hard.

01:09:31.919 --> 01:09:34.421
Iraq I, Iraq II...

01:09:34.546 --> 01:09:37.341
This is all
your fault, Evan!
What are you doing?

01:09:37.424 --> 01:09:39.593
We got beef!
No, we don't have beef.

01:09:39.676 --> 01:09:41.511
We don't have beefs!
Not the beef.

01:09:41.595 --> 01:09:43.430
Yeah, yeah, come on.
Let's do the "we
got beef" thing.

01:09:43.514 --> 01:09:45.599
That's not gonna
work on two <i>federales.</i>
Yes, it will.

01:09:45.683 --> 01:09:47.225
Look, look, look. The gun.

01:09:48.018 --> 01:09:49.185
We said we weren't
gonna do this.

01:09:49.270 --> 01:09:50.312
You son of a bitch!

01:09:50.437 --> 01:09:53.774
You better watch that ass!
You'll see me kick it!

01:09:54.525 --> 01:09:56.861
Okay, kangaroo punch
coming, nice and easy.

01:09:56.944 --> 01:09:58.070
Ready?
No kangaroo.

01:09:58.487 --> 01:09:59.572
Fuck you!

01:09:59.655 --> 01:10:02.032
What did you call me?
A pussy mouth?

01:10:02.116 --> 01:10:03.909
You are a fucking idiot!

01:10:03.993 --> 01:10:05.744
Yeah, I'm mad at you, too!

01:10:08.205 --> 01:10:09.206
Okay, time out, guys.

01:10:09.290 --> 01:10:10.457
Fuck you!

01:10:11.834 --> 01:10:13.544
Oh!

01:10:13.878 --> 01:10:16.630
The only reason
that I have lived
with you this long

01:10:16.714 --> 01:10:18.549
is because I felt guilty!

01:10:18.632 --> 01:10:20.509
- Let it out, Evan.
- I am done...

01:10:20.593 --> 01:10:22.193
That's good.
...taking care of your shit!

01:10:29.393 --> 01:10:30.394
Are you okay?

01:10:39.278 --> 01:10:41.071
Did you not see
that I had the gun?

01:10:41.155 --> 01:10:42.156
You did?

01:10:42.615 --> 01:10:44.033
We are done.

01:10:44.116 --> 01:10:46.410
You and me, we are done!

01:10:46.493 --> 01:10:48.203
I'm gonna murder you!
No, you're not!

01:10:48.662 --> 01:10:50.122
For real!
I'm gonna murder...

01:10:57.838 --> 01:10:59.173
What the hell is going on?

01:11:00.591 --> 01:11:03.594
Tracy. Hi.

01:11:04.011 --> 01:11:05.429
There you are.

01:11:05.512 --> 01:11:07.514
I'm a bit strung out
right now. I'm sorry.

01:11:14.688 --> 01:11:15.814
Yeah, Tracy.

01:11:18.692 --> 01:11:20.361
In! Out!

01:11:22.696 --> 01:11:24.865
Hey! Hi! Yeah!

01:11:28.661 --> 01:11:31.121
Tracy. Tracy!
Let me go! Tracy!

01:11:31.205 --> 01:11:32.957
Nardo, I just came here
to help you, that's it.

01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:34.375
I know, I know. Look.

01:11:34.792 --> 01:11:36.794
Tracy, I love you.

01:11:37.461 --> 01:11:38.671
Okay?

01:11:38.754 --> 01:11:40.923
I'm sorry my friends
ruined our wedding.

01:11:41.006 --> 01:11:43.133
I never should've
questioned marrying you.

01:11:43.217 --> 01:11:44.301
Look.

01:11:44.385 --> 01:11:46.637
I have been through hell
trying to find you.

01:11:47.304 --> 01:11:49.682
I mean, look at me.
I practically walked here.

01:11:49.890 --> 01:11:52.893
Just, from now on,
nothing keeps
us apart, okay?

01:11:52.977 --> 01:11:54.395
So, will you just...

01:11:54.478 --> 01:11:56.063
Will you just take me back?

01:11:56.146 --> 01:11:58.732
And we can just get married
and be happy, please?

01:11:59.483 --> 01:12:00.693
I love you, Nardo.

01:12:00.776 --> 01:12:02.277
You guys,
I just wanna say that...

01:12:02.403 --> 01:12:04.989
I was wrong. You guys,
you do belong together.

01:12:05.072 --> 01:12:06.907
You guys should
jail fuck right now

01:12:06.991 --> 01:12:08.742
and make a baby that
has dual citizenship.

01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:13.163
I don't need
your permission.

01:12:13.622 --> 01:12:14.790
Get over here.

01:12:20.504 --> 01:12:21.839
Hey, I was wrong
about them.

01:12:22.423 --> 01:12:23.841
Yeah, me, too.

01:12:23.924 --> 01:12:25.092
I'm sorry.

01:12:26.010 --> 01:12:27.136
It's okay.

01:12:28.762 --> 01:12:30.597
- What was that sound?
- My truck!

01:12:31.765 --> 01:12:32.891
Berk?

01:12:33.225 --> 01:12:34.810
God!

01:12:40.566 --> 01:12:41.966
They got my ear!
They nicked my ear!

01:12:46.113 --> 01:12:47.489
- My God!
- Oh, my God!

01:12:48.699 --> 01:12:49.908
Gunshots!
There's definitely guns!

01:12:49.992 --> 01:12:50.993
I'm bleeding.

01:12:51.076 --> 01:12:52.119
It's okay.
You're okay.

01:12:54.288 --> 01:12:56.540
I'm gonna invite
myself to the party!

01:12:57.291 --> 01:12:58.292
Ring-a-ling-a-ling!

01:12:59.626 --> 01:13:00.836
Ring-a-ling-a-ling!

01:13:01.712 --> 01:13:03.881
Pick the goddamn phone up!

01:13:03.964 --> 01:13:05.591
Say something, Evan,
say something!

01:13:05.674 --> 01:13:08.677
I don't know who you are,
but you can take the cocaine!

01:13:08.761 --> 01:13:09.887
We don't want it.

01:13:09.970 --> 01:13:12.097
No, that's not how it works.

01:13:12.181 --> 01:13:14.183
You cross me,

01:13:14.266 --> 01:13:17.853
I kill you. Understand?
That's how it works.

01:13:18.479 --> 01:13:19.521
I'm gonna kill his ass.

01:13:20.022 --> 01:13:21.106
I'm gonna let Grammy watch,

01:13:21.190 --> 01:13:23.442
and I love Grammies,
believe me.

01:13:23.525 --> 01:13:26.403
But in this case,
I'm gonna take my hand,

01:13:26.487 --> 01:13:29.531
I'm gonna run my hand
up the crack of Grammy's ass,

01:13:30.407 --> 01:13:31.408
you understand?

01:13:31.492 --> 01:13:34.244
She's gonna stand next to me
while I squeeze her booty,

01:13:34.328 --> 01:13:35.579
and she's gonna go...

01:13:35.704 --> 01:13:37.039
Ooh!

01:13:37.289 --> 01:13:38.874
'Cause that's
what Grammies do.

01:13:39.583 --> 01:13:41.168
Say something nice.

01:13:41.251 --> 01:13:42.836
Make a friend.

01:13:43.170 --> 01:13:44.755
You can have
our Smart car!

01:13:44.838 --> 01:13:47.299
What the fuck I wanna
do with a Smart car? Huh?

01:13:47.382 --> 01:13:50.594
I'll put that motherfucker
in drive and drive
it up your asshole,

01:13:50.677 --> 01:13:52.930
and step out of it
and let it run
up your asshole!

01:13:53.013 --> 01:13:56.016
And there's gonna be
smoke coming out your ass!

01:13:56.517 --> 01:13:58.685
But then you'd
be in my asshole, too!

01:13:58.977 --> 01:14:00.979
Shut the fuck up!
I already said it already!

01:14:01.396 --> 01:14:02.940
That's my analogy!

01:14:03.023 --> 01:14:05.526
I'll shoot that
goddamn Smart car dead!

01:14:05.609 --> 01:14:07.152
Well, that's not
gonna work for us!

01:14:07.236 --> 01:14:09.071
Nardo comes home with us!

01:14:09.154 --> 01:14:10.989
Yeah, he's our friend!

01:14:11.073 --> 01:14:12.574
He's your friend?

01:14:12.658 --> 01:14:14.201
"He's my friend!"
Well, guess what?

01:14:14.284 --> 01:14:16.203
I got friends,
too, motherfucker!

01:14:27.548 --> 01:14:28.841
Okay, here's what
we're gonna do.

01:14:28.924 --> 01:14:31.093
I am gonna go out
there and draw their
fire to distract them,

01:14:31.176 --> 01:14:32.803
you guys are gonna
run to Tracy's car.

01:14:32.928 --> 01:14:35.088
If anybody should do it,
it should be me.
What? Why you?

01:14:35.097 --> 01:14:36.140
Because I'm a loser.

01:14:36.223 --> 01:14:37.641
I mean, you're about
to get a promotion,

01:14:37.724 --> 01:14:39.560
Nardo finally got Tracy,

01:14:39.643 --> 01:14:41.854
he's gonna put
a little baby pig up
there in that city.

01:14:41.937 --> 01:14:42.980
What?
Yeah.

01:14:43.063 --> 01:14:45.065
All right, guys.
Let's go get them!

01:14:45.149 --> 01:14:46.650
Just like
Thelma and Louise!

01:14:46.733 --> 01:14:47.733
No, wait, they died!

01:14:47.776 --> 01:14:49.069
They drove off
the Grand Canyon!

01:14:56.577 --> 01:14:58.245
What the fuck?

01:15:07.212 --> 01:15:08.338
Shit!

01:15:08.922 --> 01:15:09.923
Beanbag.

01:15:12.050 --> 01:15:13.051
Ooh.

01:15:15.846 --> 01:15:17.764
Oh, shit.
Nardo!

01:15:22.561 --> 01:15:23.854
Your whole sac is out!

01:15:23.937 --> 01:15:25.189
Yeah, your balls are...

01:15:25.272 --> 01:15:26.481
Well, they're
tiny underwear.

01:15:26.565 --> 01:15:28.192
No, they're gonna
get shot off, man.

01:15:33.322 --> 01:15:34.323
We should go.

01:15:35.699 --> 01:15:37.159
Come on, honey!

01:15:39.328 --> 01:15:40.621
Oh, shit!

01:15:43.123 --> 01:15:44.249
Shit!

01:15:45.375 --> 01:15:46.835
I'll drive,
I'll drive!

01:15:53.508 --> 01:15:54.593
Oh, shit!

01:15:55.135 --> 01:15:57.137
- Nardo! Get in!
- Get in!

01:15:57.221 --> 01:15:58.347
Go, go, go, go!

01:15:59.264 --> 01:16:00.265
Oh, shit!

01:16:09.483 --> 01:16:10.567
Look at them!

01:16:11.485 --> 01:16:13.195
Yeah! Fuck you!

01:16:19.576 --> 01:16:20.953
You think you're
gonna make your meeting?

01:16:21.036 --> 01:16:22.412
I think it'll be close.

01:16:22.496 --> 01:16:27.042
You guys, I wanna
apologize for basically
everything I've done.

01:16:27.125 --> 01:16:30.003
And, Tracy, I wanna
plan a new wedding, okay?
What do you say?

01:16:30.087 --> 01:16:31.922
I think it's...
Uh, no, no, no.

01:16:32.005 --> 01:16:33.507
When we get re-engaged,

01:16:33.590 --> 01:16:36.593
it's gonna be without you
two assholes in the car.

01:16:36.677 --> 01:16:37.719
Sorry.

01:16:37.803 --> 01:16:39.054
Fair enough.

01:16:39.972 --> 01:16:42.182
And you,
I need you to move out.

01:16:42.516 --> 01:16:43.892
Excuse me?
ASAP.

01:16:43.976 --> 01:16:45.269
What?
It means
"as soon as possible."

01:16:45.352 --> 01:16:47.020
I know what ASAP means.

01:16:47.354 --> 01:16:48.438
I finally get it.

01:16:48.522 --> 01:16:50.440
It's time.
You need some space.

01:16:50.524 --> 01:16:51.900
Look, we're best friends.

01:16:51.984 --> 01:16:53.819
We will always
be best friends.

01:16:53.902 --> 01:16:55.487
Nothing is gonna
change that.

01:16:55.862 --> 01:16:57.906
I do think I am gonna
get my own place, though.

01:16:59.825 --> 01:17:01.034
I just like it
when we're all together.

01:17:01.118 --> 01:17:02.286
I know.

01:17:03.996 --> 01:17:06.039
Uh, how am I gonna
get across the border?

01:17:06.707 --> 01:17:09.501
I'm just not really good
with small spaces, so...

01:17:40.574 --> 01:17:41.908
So, what do you
think you're gonna say?

01:17:41.992 --> 01:17:44.202
Jason, you got me here,
that's all you
can do. Thanks.

01:17:45.579 --> 01:17:47.372
Oh, she looks mad.
She looks really mad.

01:17:47.456 --> 01:17:48.498
Motherfucker!

01:17:58.467 --> 01:17:59.827
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:18:00.719 --> 01:18:01.887
Did I read that wrong?

01:18:01.970 --> 01:18:03.597
Yes.
Sorry.

01:18:04.848 --> 01:18:05.932
I'm sorry about everything.

01:18:06.016 --> 01:18:07.059
Okay, we'll talk
about it later.

01:18:07.100 --> 01:18:08.900
We have a meeting
to get to.
Screw the meeting.

01:18:08.935 --> 01:18:10.979
I'm probably gonna get fired.

01:18:11.063 --> 01:18:13.103
And I didn't
come here for that.
I came here for you.

01:18:14.316 --> 01:18:16.651
I never asked you out
because we work together,

01:18:16.735 --> 01:18:20.238
but I think part
of me was scared
and I'm done being scared.

01:18:22.991 --> 01:18:24.076
Wow, really?

01:18:24.451 --> 01:18:25.744
Read it wrong again.

01:18:25.827 --> 01:18:26.995
Should've known.

01:18:27.579 --> 01:18:29.122
We have a meeting. Come on.

01:18:52.729 --> 01:18:53.730
I don't
know what got into you,

01:18:53.814 --> 01:18:56.233
but the client loved
your presentation.

01:18:56.900 --> 01:19:00.028
I'm giving you a promotion.
Congratulations.

01:19:00.112 --> 01:19:01.154
Thank you, sir.

01:19:01.238 --> 01:19:02.239
Oh!

01:19:02.322 --> 01:19:04.616
Yeah, boy!
You're gonna crush it!

01:19:04.699 --> 01:19:07.577
First you get the promotion,
then you move in with us!

01:19:07.661 --> 01:19:08.787
Whoo! Spaghetti Tuesdays!

01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:10.372
You're gonna move
in with us, right?

01:19:11.289 --> 01:19:12.332
Get the fuck out of here.

01:19:13.208 --> 01:19:14.334
Okay.

01:19:26.805 --> 01:19:29.433
I gotta hand it you,
Nardo, you were right.

01:19:29.516 --> 01:19:30.642
You do know
how to pick them.

01:19:32.102 --> 01:19:34.187
So do you, you old dog.

01:19:35.105 --> 01:19:37.023
Think she'll let
you kiss her tonight?

01:19:37.107 --> 01:19:38.108
Oh. Come on.

01:19:38.191 --> 01:19:40.318
But yeah,
hopefully she'll let
me kiss her tonight.

01:19:40.735 --> 01:19:43.280
You ever think you'll
be able to learn how
to love Tracy?

01:19:43.363 --> 01:19:46.283
No, Evan.
I think I'll be able
to learn how to love...

01:19:46.366 --> 01:19:48.118
Wait, what did you say?
I said, learn how
to love Tracy.

01:19:48.201 --> 01:19:49.870
Oh, yeah, I will.
I know I'll learn
how to love her, yeah.

01:19:49.953 --> 01:19:50.996
Okay, guys.

01:19:52.205 --> 01:19:53.248
Hi.

01:19:53.707 --> 01:19:55.417
Congratulations.
Thank you.

01:19:57.043 --> 01:19:58.044
Mmm.

01:20:00.547 --> 01:20:02.174
You're family now.

01:20:02.257 --> 01:20:04.050
Yeah. Don't forget it.

01:20:09.222 --> 01:20:10.265
I love you.

01:20:11.475 --> 01:20:13.935
Hey, I just remembered
where I know this guy from.

01:20:14.019 --> 01:20:15.312
Great, Marty.
We'll talk about it later.

01:20:15.395 --> 01:20:16.855
No, we got high
with him in my van.

01:20:16.938 --> 01:20:18.356
He doesn't wanna
marry this chick.

01:20:18.440 --> 01:20:20.150
Okay. Marty,
that's okay.
Just sit down.

01:20:20.233 --> 01:20:21.359
No, Marty, we already
took care of this.

01:20:21.443 --> 01:20:22.652
You can't let this... No.
Marty, sit down.

01:20:22.736 --> 01:20:23.987
We're not taking
those rings.
Marty, Marty...

01:20:24.070 --> 01:20:25.822
You shouldn't
do this.
You're off base here, pal.

01:20:25.906 --> 01:20:27.699
No. Hey, you don't
wanna do this, dude!
Okay.

01:20:27.782 --> 01:20:28.950
Hey, remember the weed?
Marty! Marty.

01:20:29.034 --> 01:20:31.620
I was just talking
it through.
That's all I was doing!

01:20:32.078 --> 01:20:33.413
Sorry, Grammy.

01:20:33.497 --> 01:20:35.040
You need weed right now...

01:20:35.123 --> 01:20:36.833
Absolutely, you need weed!

01:20:36.917 --> 01:20:39.211
<i>Today is the day
you say forever</i>

01:20:39.294 --> 01:20:41.505
<i>From now on,
you stand together</i>

01:20:41.588 --> 01:20:43.882
<i>Two hearts united
in wedded bliss</i>

01:20:43.965 --> 01:20:47.928
<i>As you say your vows,
remember this</i>

01:20:48.386 --> 01:20:51.348
<i>He's got the last penis
you're ever gonna see</i>

01:20:51.431 --> 01:20:54.392
<i>The last penis
you'll feel inside your mouth</i>

01:20:54.476 --> 01:20:56.353
<i>Hope he touches your clit,
not just your heart</i>

01:20:56.436 --> 01:20:59.272
<i>'Cause he's the only one</i>
<i>who will till</i>
<i>death do you part</i>

01:21:00.273 --> 01:21:02.859
<i>She's the last woman
you'll ever be inside of</i>

01:21:02.943 --> 01:21:05.904
<i>The last mouth you'll have
wrapped around your dick</i>

01:21:05.987 --> 01:21:07.781
<i>She'll find you</i>
<i>less attractive</i>
<i>as the years go by</i>

01:21:07.864 --> 01:21:11.743
<i>But that's the only vagina</i>
<i>that will ever make</i>
<i>you come until you die</i>

01:21:15.789 --> 01:21:18.542
<i>So, congrats to
the man and wife</i>

01:21:18.625 --> 01:21:22.796
<i>For only fucking each other
for the rest of your life</i>

01:22:22.439 --> 01:22:23.732
I gotta hand it
to you, Nardo, you did it.

01:22:23.815 --> 01:22:24.816
Yeah.

01:22:25.150 --> 01:22:26.985
Well, I mean,
this is the dream
right here.

01:22:27.068 --> 01:22:28.778
You know, hanging out
with my two best friends

01:22:28.862 --> 01:22:30.989
in a good
old-fashioned Narduzzi.

01:22:31.072 --> 01:22:32.741
I couldn't have done
it without you guys.

01:22:32.824 --> 01:22:34.784
Ah, cheers to that, man.
Cheers.

01:22:34.868 --> 01:22:36.745
It'd be cool if there
were girls in the tub.

01:22:36.828 --> 01:22:38.121
It is what it is.

01:22:38.204 --> 01:22:39.664
- Daniel!
- Grammy?

01:22:39.748 --> 01:22:41.082
What are you doing here?

01:22:41.166 --> 01:22:43.543
A man sent me here
to watch something.

01:22:43.877 --> 01:22:45.045
- Watch something?
- What?

01:22:47.213 --> 01:22:48.214
What is that?

01:22:49.090 --> 01:22:50.383
Go, go, go!

01:31:48.754 --> 01:31:50.006
What happened?

01:31:50.089 --> 01:31:52.091
Nothing. You passed out.

01:31:56.137 --> 01:31:57.388
Are we having sex?

01:31:57.930 --> 01:31:59.182
No.

01:31:59.265 --> 01:32:00.766
I'm prepping you.
What?

01:32:00.850 --> 01:32:02.059
We could have sex, though.

01:32:02.143 --> 01:32:04.228
I mean, if you want to.

01:32:05.104 --> 01:32:06.522
Got time.

01:32:08.441 --> 01:32:09.525
Okay. Yeah, okay.

01:32:09.609 --> 01:32:12.862
Yeah? You should know
you are completely paralyzed.

01:32:16.282 --> 01:32:17.408
Oh, my God.

01:32:17.491 --> 01:32:20.286
So that means your dick
is not gonna work.

01:32:20.870 --> 01:32:23.873
My dick works great, though.

01:32:25.875 --> 01:32:27.168
Okay.
You know what?

01:32:27.251 --> 01:32:28.920
I always wanted to find out

01:32:29.003 --> 01:32:30.379
what this did.

01:32:30.713 --> 01:32:31.964
What?

01:32:32.089 --> 01:32:34.342
JK, man, JK. I'm not.

01:32:34.425 --> 01:32:35.551
What's "JK" stand for?

01:32:35.635 --> 01:32:36.719
"Just kidding."

01:32:36.802 --> 01:32:37.845
I text a lot.

01:32:37.929 --> 01:32:40.089
I thought it stood for,
like, "jolly cock"
or something.

01:32:40.097 --> 01:32:41.724
No.
I don't know.

01:32:41.807 --> 01:32:43.059
"Jolly cock,"
though, would be pretty...

01:32:43.142 --> 01:32:44.393
Sex talk.

01:32:47.897 --> 01:32:48.898
Hey.

01:32:48.981 --> 01:32:52.068
Hey, you wanna play...
You wanna play
<i>Silence of the Lambs?</i>

01:32:52.151 --> 01:32:54.445
We did that and
never got to it.

01:32:54.987 --> 01:32:56.989
Sorry.
It's okay, it's okay.

01:33:00.159 --> 01:33:01.327
Cut!

01:33:02.495 --> 01:33:03.996
"Jolly cock."
Cut.
