01:40.166 --> 01:42.667
A sonic disintegrator?

01:42.669 --> 01:44.168
What would anyone
do with that?

01:44.170 --> 01:45.770
What a dweeb.

01:45.772 --> 01:47.973
Building a gizmo
that just destroys stuff.

01:49.875 --> 01:50.875
Oops.

01:50.877 --> 01:52.043
I've got a feeling

01:52.045 --> 01:54.178
that we better head over
to Top Notch Scientific

01:54.180 --> 01:56.081
and keep on eye
on that invention.

01:56.083 --> 01:57.381
What for?

01:57.383 --> 01:59.049
Well, every time
April does a report

01:59.051 --> 02:01.386
about some new
scientific breakthrough,

02:01.388 --> 02:03.821
Shredder sees it, too,
and shows up to steal it.

02:03.823 --> 02:06.024
You know, Raphael's right.

02:06.026 --> 02:08.126
There is something
of a pattern there.

02:08.127 --> 02:10.794
And that Sonic Disintegrator
is just the sort of thing

02:10.797 --> 02:12.764
they could put
to some terrible use.

All-in-all, dudes, I'd rather
be home in a cool sewer

02:33.020 --> 02:34.452

02:34.454 --> 02:36.420
Do you think
we over-reacted
this time?

02:36.422 --> 02:37.756
I don't think so.

02:37.758 --> 02:38.790
Listen.

02:38.792 --> 02:39.958
[doorknob rattling]

02:42.394 --> 02:44.228

02:48.902 --> 02:52.137
Swell. We're here at the right
time but it's the wrong guys.

02:52.139 --> 02:53.672
The Turtles.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.640
Nail 'em, boys.

03:02.615 --> 03:05.250
I gotta tell ya, I think I
would've preferred Shredder.

03:05.252 --> 03:08.853
You doity toitles, it's
coitains for you, see?

03:08.855 --> 03:12.456
Wow, this guy's been
watching way too many
'30s gangster movies.

03:12.458 --> 03:15.359
Let's get those goofazoids!

03:17.630 --> 03:18.763
I'll take that.

03:20.700 --> 03:22.968
Hey!

03:22.970 --> 03:24.335
Can I quote you on that?

03:26.672 --> 03:28.105
My turn!

03:36.114 --> 03:37.882
Ha! Works every time.

03:37.884 --> 03:39.384
But you never
tried that before.

03:39.386 --> 03:42.152
Well, so? Every time
I've tried it, it's worked.

03:42.154 --> 03:43.320
Whoa!

03:43.322 --> 03:45.923
Uh-huh. That's what you
get for showing off.

03:45.925 --> 03:48.726
Well, don't just stand
there, help me!

03:48.728 --> 03:49.727
Nice to be needed.

03:49.729 --> 03:51.295
Uh, excuse me?

03:51.297 --> 03:54.298
Hi. Don't you think it's
time you cracked a few books?

03:56.167 --> 03:58.269
Hey, where's Big Louie?

03:58.271 --> 04:00.538
That big chicken. He split.

04:00.540 --> 04:02.640
Those rotten shellbacks.

04:02.642 --> 04:03.974
They'll pay for this.

04:03.976 --> 04:07.111
All right you losers. What does
a crook like Big Louie want

04:07.113 --> 04:09.013
with a sonic disintegrator?

04:09.015 --> 04:10.815
Why should we tell you?

04:10.817 --> 04:13.551
I can give you
three good reasons.

04:13.553 --> 04:15.553
Hey! In that case,

04:15.555 --> 04:18.389
he wanted to use it to
disintegrate the doors
on the bank vaults.

04:18.391 --> 04:21.058
Uh, yeah. He said
we'd go on a bank
robbing spree,

04:21.060 --> 04:22.359
and nothing could stop us.

04:22.361 --> 04:25.496
Except the boys in green.

04:25.498 --> 04:27.097
[distant police siren]
Uh-oh.

04:27.099 --> 04:28.900
Here come the boys in blue.

04:28.902 --> 04:30.234
Come on, let's split.

04:30.236 --> 04:32.303
The police can handle
these jokers.

Proceeding to next target.

05:30.996 --> 05:33.063
I guess we showed those crooks.

05:33.065 --> 05:37.568
For sure.
I say we've earned some
well-deserved goof-off time.

05:37.570 --> 05:39.637
Not so fast, Michelangelo.

05:39.639 --> 05:43.240
My intuition tells me Krang
and Shredder are behind this.

05:43.242 --> 05:45.843
Let us hope you are
incorrect, Leonardo.

05:50.249 --> 05:51.316
Hold on, it's April.

05:51.318 --> 05:53.884
We interrupt for
a special report.

05:53.886 --> 05:56.020
A short while ago
on this spot,

05:56.022 --> 05:58.556
a strange-looking machine
appeared from the sky,

05:58.558 --> 06:01.592
terrorizing the city
and causing mass hysteria.

06:01.594 --> 06:06.097
So far, the only damage it's
done has been to the entryways
of office buildings.

06:06.099 --> 06:08.532
Looks like we're hitting
the bricks again, dudes.

06:15.473 --> 06:18.943
I'm telling you, something this
weird doesn't happen without

06:18.945 --> 06:21.012
Krang and Shredder
being involved.

06:21.014 --> 06:24.182
From the looks of it,
I'd say this thing came
from outer space.

06:24.184 --> 06:25.884
Not the bottom of the ocean.

06:25.886 --> 06:28.953
Whatever this thing is,
it's totally mechanical.

06:28.955 --> 06:31.288
It came here packed
like a pickle.

06:31.290 --> 06:32.356
Excuse me.

06:32.358 --> 06:34.425
Not now, Michelangelo.

06:34.427 --> 06:39.563
The question is, why is this,
this thing, so interested in
business buildings?

06:39.565 --> 06:41.398
Maybe it's looking
for office space.

06:41.400 --> 06:42.500
Excuse me.

06:42.502 --> 06:43.801
Not now, Donatello.

06:45.737 --> 06:47.872
Look. A mini-missile.

06:47.874 --> 06:49.240
What did I tell ya?

06:49.242 --> 06:51.142
That has to be Krang
and Shredder.

06:51.144 --> 06:53.278
Oh, will you knock
it off already?

06:53.280 --> 06:55.380
They're not even
in this episode.

06:55.382 --> 06:56.381
Excuse me.

06:56.383 --> 06:57.815
Later, Raphael.

06:59.484 --> 07:01.219
Ah, this is getting boring.

07:01.221 --> 07:03.687
Check it out.
Gold!

07:03.689 --> 07:05.924
Did I say boring?
Heh-heh. Erase that.

07:05.926 --> 07:07.658
This is absolutely fascinating.

07:08.827 --> 07:10.361
Excuse me.

07:10.363 --> 07:12.363
Not now!

07:12.365 --> 07:14.399
But I believe
that is mine.

07:14.401 --> 07:16.267
Kerma!
Whoa!

07:16.269 --> 07:19.204
Our little amigo from
the planet Shel-ra-la.

07:19.206 --> 07:20.839
That sheet of gold is yours?

07:20.841 --> 07:23.708
Yes. As you know,
we turtleoids need

07:23.710 --> 07:26.143
gold's reflected
light for energy.

07:26.145 --> 07:29.013
Ahh, that is most refreshing.

07:29.015 --> 07:30.848
Good thing you found
that gold sheet.

07:30.850 --> 07:35.620
Oh, no problem.
I could easily have made another
with my miniature gold machine.

07:35.622 --> 07:38.555
I must have dropped
this one when I was looking
for your earlier.

07:42.527 --> 07:45.229
I've been seeking you out
to ask for your help.

07:45.231 --> 07:47.398
You see, I have
a small problem.

07:47.400 --> 07:50.101
Come. We can talk about
it in my space ship.

07:52.004 --> 07:53.404
Hey, that's right.
I nearly forgot.

07:53.406 --> 07:56.740
Your space ship looks just like
one of our office buildings.

07:56.742 --> 07:59.076
Way cool!

07:59.078 --> 08:00.912
We can talk inside.

08:02.114 --> 08:04.648
Kerma, I hate
to remind you pal,

08:04.650 --> 08:07.218
but the last time you
had a small problem,

08:07.220 --> 08:09.086
it turned out to be a
100-foot tall monster

08:09.088 --> 08:11.055
with two heads, named
Herman the Horrible.

08:11.057 --> 08:14.993
Yeah, I still carry a picture
of him in my wallet.

08:14.995 --> 08:18.595
I assure you, my problem
is not as large this time.

08:21.099 --> 08:22.666
Target in sight.

08:30.475 --> 08:32.409
Target achieved.

08:32.410 --> 08:34.645
Destroy.
Destroy.

08:34.647 --> 08:37.014
That's your small problem?

08:37.015 --> 08:38.414
I'm afraid so.

08:38.417 --> 08:40.717
I'd hate to be around
when you had a big one.

08:50.662 --> 08:52.830
Destroy.
Destroy.

08:52.832 --> 08:56.433
Kerma, you really should try to
pick a better class of friends.

08:56.435 --> 09:00.171
Believe me, Raphael,
Destructor X is no friend.

09:00.173 --> 09:02.974
Enough talk, let's take him!

09:14.085 --> 09:17.021
Whoa! Shish-kabob city!

09:24.897 --> 09:27.664
So that's why it's been blasting
its way into buildings.

09:27.666 --> 09:29.834
It's been looking for
Kerma's space ship.

09:29.836 --> 09:32.870
Terrific.
Now how about figuring out
some way to stop it?

09:36.074 --> 09:39.276
Target locked on.
Destroy.

09:47.518 --> 09:51.222
This place can definitely
be hazardous to your health.

09:51.224 --> 09:53.958
Kerma, aren't there
any weapons on this ship?

09:53.960 --> 09:56.894
I'm afraid not.
We turtleoids are
a peaceful race.

09:56.896 --> 10:00.097
Don't you remember what
happened on Shel-ra-la?

10:00.099 --> 10:01.832
Yeah, these turtleoid dudes

10:01.834 --> 10:04.501
don't have anything to protect
them but their shells.

10:04.503 --> 10:06.770
That is why I came
to you for help.

10:10.008 --> 10:12.910
Remind us to ask you
for a favor some time.

10:17.783 --> 10:20.484
Whoa! I think
I found something.

10:21.553 --> 10:23.955
Eat blazing electrons!

10:28.026 --> 10:29.160
Bummer.

10:29.162 --> 10:31.195
It's only a flashlight.

10:32.764 --> 10:34.331
Aargh!

10:36.201 --> 10:38.035
Well, whaddya know?
It worked.

10:38.037 --> 10:41.272
Bright lights must interfere
with its sensor functions.

10:41.274 --> 10:43.541
Kerma, is there a back
way out of this ship?

10:43.543 --> 10:45.242
Yes, this way.

10:45.244 --> 10:46.843
Then let's go.

10:49.414 --> 10:52.450
Keep moving. That thing is
sure to be following us.

10:52.452 --> 10:55.753
Okay, we know it has one
weakness, bright lights.

10:55.755 --> 10:58.222
Now to get someplace safe
until we come up with a way

10:58.224 --> 11:00.191
to defeat
that walking arsenal.

11:00.193 --> 11:03.194
Hey dudes, what about Channel 6?

11:03.196 --> 11:05.696
They've got mondo bright
lights in the studios.

11:05.698 --> 11:08.665
Lights. What a bright idea.

11:08.667 --> 11:11.102
Hey! I made a funny.

11:18.777 --> 11:19.877
Hi, Vernon.

11:19.879 --> 11:21.979
Nice night, huh?
Huh?

11:21.981 --> 11:24.648
I could swear I saw five
of those green weirdoes

11:24.650 --> 11:26.817
instead
of the usual four.

11:26.819 --> 11:28.919
Must be all that overtime
I've been putting in.

11:30.255 --> 11:32.823
Whoa, those stinkin' turtles.

11:32.825 --> 11:35.792
Not only do they keep me
from stealing that sonic
disintegrator,

11:35.794 --> 11:38.662
but they get two of my best
goons tossed in the slammer.

11:38.664 --> 11:43.334
So help me, I'll make those
amphibians pay, but good.

11:43.336 --> 11:47.871
Uh, technically, they're
not amphibians, boss,
they're reptiles.

11:47.873 --> 11:50.241
Who asked ya?

11:50.243 --> 11:55.079
Hold on, it's one of them
mugs from Channel 6 who are
in tight with them toitles.

11:58.217 --> 11:59.817
What's the meaning of this?

11:59.819 --> 12:01.485
We pedestrians have
the right-of-way.

12:04.756 --> 12:07.925
But I'd be happy to vote
to have that law changed.

12:07.927 --> 12:09.660
Just don't hurt me, please.

12:09.662 --> 12:12.897
I'm looking for them
four slimy turtles.

12:12.899 --> 12:13.998
You know where they are?

12:14.000 --> 12:15.332
Uh, actually,

12:15.334 --> 12:17.501
it may be five slimy turtles.

12:17.503 --> 12:19.870
Never mind the
arithmetic lesson,

12:19.872 --> 12:21.772
where are they?

12:21.774 --> 12:23.340
Th-they're at Channel 6.

12:23.342 --> 12:25.242
I just saw them go in.

12:27.412 --> 12:30.447
Kerma, are you saying that thing
that's been terrorizing

12:30.449 --> 12:32.549
this city is actually
after you?

12:32.551 --> 12:35.386
Yes, it is called Destructor X.

12:35.388 --> 12:38.822
A law enforcement drone
designed to track down

12:38.824 --> 12:40.991
the galaxy's most
vicious criminals.

12:40.993 --> 12:44.228
Since when is a piece
of a little guy like you

12:44.230 --> 12:45.329
a vicious criminal?

12:45.331 --> 12:47.932
Destructor X was
programmed to go after

12:47.934 --> 12:50.901
a notorious space
pirate named Nurma.

12:50.903 --> 12:52.702
But due to an electronic error,

12:52.704 --> 12:54.238
it came out "Kerma."

12:54.240 --> 12:56.240
You mean that thing
is out to blow you away

12:56.242 --> 12:57.874
because of a glitch?

12:57.876 --> 12:59.543
Apparently so.

12:59.545 --> 13:01.578
Another triumph for science.

13:01.580 --> 13:02.712
[loud crashing noise]

13:02.714 --> 13:05.215
Uh-oh. Here it
comes again, dudes.

13:05.217 --> 13:09.119
All right toitles,
say your prayers.

13:09.121 --> 13:10.654
Oh, not again.

13:10.656 --> 13:13.290
Well, at least it's not
Shredder and his mutants.

13:13.292 --> 13:15.826
Yeah, this should
be a light workout.

13:22.767 --> 13:25.970
Uh-oh. More like
the main event, dudes.

13:32.010 --> 13:34.044
April, hit the lights.

13:36.448 --> 13:38.249
All right!

13:40.319 --> 13:41.519
What's that thing?

13:41.521 --> 13:43.754
Who cares? I'm after
those toitles!

13:45.457 --> 13:47.891
Okay, boss.
That's one of them.

13:49.294 --> 13:51.362
Hey, what's this?

13:51.364 --> 13:53.130
Gold!

13:53.132 --> 13:55.132
Where did you get this, turtle?

13:55.134 --> 13:57.935
I, uh, uh, I made it myself

13:57.937 --> 13:59.937
with my portable gold machine.

13:59.939 --> 14:01.305
Gold machine?

14:01.307 --> 14:02.740
Forget the turtle,

14:02.742 --> 14:05.509
this thing's worth
it's weight in...in...
uh...

14:05.511 --> 14:06.477
gold?

14:06.479 --> 14:08.679
Just the word I was looking for.

14:08.681 --> 14:10.914
Come on, boys, let's scram.

14:17.522 --> 14:20.290
Destroy! Destroy!

14:22.760 --> 14:25.696
Man, is there any part
of that thing's body
that isn't a weapon?

14:27.966 --> 14:29.600
Apparently not.

14:32.603 --> 14:34.004
Guys, at this rate,

14:34.006 --> 14:36.440
we're going to run out of
lights in about one minute.

14:36.442 --> 14:40.077
Anybody come up
with a plan yet?

14:40.079 --> 14:42.012
Yeah. Let's run for it.

14:44.482 --> 14:46.083
You too, Kerma.

14:46.085 --> 14:49.386
Wait! There's
a small problem.

14:49.388 --> 14:51.455
So, would someone explain
why Big Louie

14:51.457 --> 14:53.324
was breaking
into Channel 6?

14:53.326 --> 14:57.328
Earlier tonight,
we stopped him from stealing
that sonic disintegrator.

14:57.330 --> 15:00.564
That's it! The sonic
disintegrator.

15:00.566 --> 15:03.100
It's the one thing that might
stop that metal maniac.

15:03.102 --> 15:04.869
My friend,

15:04.871 --> 15:06.804
I'm afraid there
is a little problem.

15:08.506 --> 15:10.708
Oh, Kerma, not again.

15:10.710 --> 15:14.679
Look, is this
a "little" little problem,
or a "big" little problem?

15:14.681 --> 15:18.648
That nasty person
took my gold machine.

15:18.650 --> 15:20.617
And I'm too weak to go on.

15:20.619 --> 15:23.387
I'd call that a
humongous problem.

15:23.389 --> 15:25.822
We're going to have to get
Kerma to someplace safe.
[beep]

15:26.991 --> 15:28.292
[beep]
Master Splinter.

15:28.294 --> 15:30.394
What is it, Leonardo?
We need your help.

15:30.396 --> 15:33.530
Meet us at April's apartment,
and please hurry.

15:36.834 --> 15:38.902
Kerma, you better lie down.

15:38.904 --> 15:41.204
You're going to have
to guard him, master.

15:41.206 --> 15:43.707
In case that Destructor X
shows up again.

15:43.709 --> 15:44.875
I will do my best.

15:44.877 --> 15:46.544
Donatello, you and
Michelangelo head over

15:46.546 --> 15:48.913
to Top Notch Scientific

15:48.915 --> 15:50.548
and get that
sonic disintegrator.

15:50.550 --> 15:53.050
Raphael and I will
take care of Big Louie.

15:53.052 --> 15:56.219
Go green machine!

16:24.249 --> 16:26.249
That'll be
five dollars, gents.

16:28.453 --> 16:31.188
Here you go, pal.
Keep the change.

16:31.190 --> 16:33.023
Those are Big Louie's
men inside.

16:36.061 --> 16:38.028
We can follow them
to his hideout.

16:38.030 --> 16:39.362
And Kerma's gold machine.

16:44.302 --> 16:46.036
I'm afraid
he's growing weaker.

16:46.038 --> 16:48.271
I have locked all
the stairway doors.

16:48.273 --> 16:50.741
That is all we can do for now.
[crashing sound]

16:50.743 --> 16:52.042
Uh-oh.

16:52.044 --> 16:53.143
Company.

17:03.755 --> 17:06.890
Those locked doors aren't going
to slow that thing down.

17:06.892 --> 17:08.791
We must get Kerma out of here.

17:08.794 --> 17:10.093
Quickly.

17:15.934 --> 17:17.601
Hurry, April.

17:32.017 --> 17:34.752
Come, April. We must do
something to defend ourselves.

17:34.754 --> 17:37.187
Defend ourselves?
How?

17:37.189 --> 17:40.157
Donatello told me about
its one weak spot.

17:40.159 --> 17:41.491
Its eyes.

17:41.493 --> 17:42.559
I have a plan.

18:26.404 --> 18:28.772
Visual field nullified.

18:30.441 --> 18:32.609
Puree Marble Company.

18:32.611 --> 18:34.544
So that's Big Louie's hideout.

18:34.546 --> 18:37.614
Funny, I thought that guy
lost his marbles years ago.

18:37.616 --> 18:38.715
Come on.

18:42.286 --> 18:45.255
Aww, what's wrong with this
stupid gold machine?

18:45.257 --> 18:47.825
I shoulda made that turtle
tell us how it works

18:47.827 --> 18:48.992
before we grabbed it.

18:50.528 --> 18:52.295
I'll get their attention.

18:52.297 --> 18:53.396
You cover me.

18:53.398 --> 18:55.632
Cover you? With what?

18:55.634 --> 18:56.633
With these.

18:56.635 --> 18:58.535
Come on, already.

18:58.537 --> 19:01.672
I wanna be rich beyond
the wildest dreams of avarice.

19:01.674 --> 19:04.841
Aw, gee, boss.
What a pretty phrase.

19:04.843 --> 19:05.909
What's it mean?

19:05.911 --> 19:08.912
I dunno, I heard it
in a movie once.

19:08.914 --> 19:10.447
Don't worry, Big Louie.

19:10.449 --> 19:12.950
You'll have plenty of
time to look it up.

19:12.952 --> 19:14.451
In the prison library.

19:14.453 --> 19:16.252
It's one of them Turtles.

19:16.254 --> 19:17.721
Grab him, boys.

19:27.865 --> 19:30.133
Here guys.
Catch!

19:32.236 --> 19:33.604
All right, let's go.

19:36.140 --> 19:39.109
They got the gold machine.

19:39.111 --> 19:42.045
My dreams of untold
riches have vanished.

19:48.552 --> 19:50.386
Mondo bizarro.

19:50.388 --> 19:52.623
We keep this gizmo
from being stolen

19:52.625 --> 19:54.992
just so we can
steal it ourselves?

19:54.994 --> 19:57.027
We're not stealing it,
Michelangelo.

19:57.029 --> 19:58.528
We're just borrowing it.

19:58.530 --> 20:00.097
Besides, it's for a good cause.

20:03.868 --> 20:06.804
Thanks to that paint,
it can't see us.

20:06.806 --> 20:08.238
Why don't we make
a break for it?

20:08.240 --> 20:10.573
We must stay
and distract it.

20:10.575 --> 20:12.676
It will soon find
Kerma on the roof.

20:12.678 --> 20:13.710
Uh-oh.

20:13.712 --> 20:14.945
Look!

20:24.422 --> 20:26.457
Oh! Now what?

20:26.459 --> 20:29.493
Desperate times call for
desperate measures.

20:32.864 --> 20:35.765
Visibility once again impeded.

20:35.767 --> 20:38.068
Oh, quick thinking,
Splinter.

20:38.070 --> 20:39.769
Hurry, April.
To the roof.

20:50.515 --> 20:51.949
It found us.

20:51.951 --> 20:53.583
I'll handle it.

20:56.021 --> 20:58.188
Can...not...see.

21:16.507 --> 21:19.309
Error. Target not present.

21:23.114 --> 21:24.681
Target located.

21:24.683 --> 21:27.184
No! No, it's spotted him.

21:27.186 --> 21:29.819
No!
Stop!

21:36.560 --> 21:38.929
Commencing
destruction sequence.

21:38.931 --> 21:41.398
Not so fast, you chromium creep!

21:42.667 --> 21:44.467
Try this on for size.

21:55.246 --> 21:58.014
Poor guy.
He's all shook up.

21:58.016 --> 22:01.418
We got the gold machine back,
so Kerma should be okay.

22:01.420 --> 22:03.153
[Yawn]

22:03.155 --> 22:06.322
Oh, sorry.
I must've dozed off.

22:06.324 --> 22:07.991
Have I missed anything exciting?

22:07.993 --> 22:09.826
Oh, nothing much.

22:09.828 --> 22:12.095
We'll tell you
about it sometime.

22:13.898 --> 22:17.267
Are you sure you can get
back to Shel-ra-la with
this hole in your ship?

22:17.269 --> 22:19.936
Oh, yes. I'll just seal off
this level and navigate

22:19.938 --> 22:21.438
from the upper control room.

22:21.440 --> 22:24.040
My friends, how can
I ever thank you

22:24.042 --> 22:25.608
for all you've done
for me?

22:25.610 --> 22:29.312
Well, it's nothing we wouldn't
do for any fellow turtle, dude.

22:29.314 --> 22:30.680
But from now on,

22:30.682 --> 22:34.084
try to make sure your little
problems really are little.

22:34.086 --> 22:37.587
Yeah, like maybe even
teensy-weensy micro problems.

22:37.589 --> 22:39.823
Farewell, my friends.

22:49.100 --> 22:52.269
Whoa, for a peaceful little
turtle that Kerma sure gets
into a lot of trouble.

22:52.271 --> 22:53.437
Yeah, I know.

22:53.439 --> 22:54.705
I mean, we're turtles, too,

22:54.707 --> 22:57.341
and things like that
never happen to us.
[alarm bell]

22:57.343 --> 22:59.109
[alarm bell continues]
Look! A break-in.

22:59.111 --> 23:00.176
Let's get 'em.

23:00.178 --> 23:01.945
Stop, thieves!

23:01.947 --> 23:03.980
Cowabunga!

23:03.982 --> 23:05.449
Freeze, you nerd balls!

23:05.451 --> 23:07.751
Turtle power!
