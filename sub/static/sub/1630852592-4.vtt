WEBVTT

00:13.480 --> 00:14.600
All right?

00:15.400 --> 00:17.240
Yeah. You?

00:17.320 --> 00:18.160
Yeah.

00:19.560 --> 00:21.040
Do you want some toa-- Oh.

00:21.840 --> 00:23.040
-So?
-[Tony] What?

00:23.960 --> 00:25.440
Ask me about the date!

00:25.520 --> 00:27.280
Oh, right. Good?

00:28.240 --> 00:31.960
-Yeah. He's, uh... He's funny, isn't he?
-Definitely.

00:33.200 --> 00:34.880
Sort of... rough and...

00:35.640 --> 00:36.480
rugged?

00:36.800 --> 00:38.720
[sighs] Like he lives under a bridge.

00:39.280 --> 00:40.480
[doorbell rings]

00:46.400 --> 00:47.960
-All right?
-[Tony] Yeah.

00:48.040 --> 00:49.160
Is Roxy in there?

00:49.640 --> 00:52.440
-Yeah, why?
-Well, I've just popped round to see her.

00:52.840 --> 00:55.040
Surely you've popped round
to deliver my mail?

00:55.480 --> 00:57.320
You haven't got any mail.
Can I come in, then?

00:57.400 --> 00:58.400
It's like a zombie movie.

00:58.480 --> 01:00.680
You're always just outside the house
trying to get in.

01:00.760 --> 01:02.120
[Pat] Don't be antisocial.

01:11.680 --> 01:14.080
-Can I have that last bit of toast?
-Yeah.

01:14.280 --> 01:15.560
Ah. Cheers, babe.

01:15.640 --> 01:17.760
-Do you want something on it?
-No, you're all right.

01:17.840 --> 01:19.720
-Got any peanut butter?
-No.

01:19.800 --> 01:22.440
-Don't worry about it, honestly.
-Sure? I'll pop out and...

01:22.960 --> 01:24.560
-Honestly, don't worry.
-All right, good.

01:24.640 --> 01:25.640
[doorbell rings]

01:26.560 --> 01:30.160
Oh! I didn't tell you, did I?
Sue Fyers at work got fired.

01:30.240 --> 01:31.240
[Roxy] What for?

01:31.320 --> 01:32.320
Flashing.

01:33.200 --> 01:34.440
-Front or back?
-[door closes]

01:34.520 --> 01:36.640
Dunno, but the union's involved.
I'm staying out of it.

01:36.720 --> 01:40.040
-Right, I've got to go.
-All right. See you later, mate.

01:40.120 --> 01:41.280
Get out!

01:41.840 --> 01:43.840
-Eh?
-[Tony] What is it?

01:43.920 --> 01:46.400
A woman suing a doctor
for a botched surgery.

01:46.480 --> 01:49.000
-[Tony] Right.
-Someone blows hot and cold, don't they?

01:49.480 --> 01:51.840
Could've done with an egg,
but forget about it.

01:52.560 --> 01:54.640
What happened to you last night?
You bailed early.

01:54.720 --> 01:56.480
Yeah, sorry. Um...

01:56.800 --> 01:58.080
What time did you get home?

01:58.640 --> 02:00.000
Uh... About ten.

02:00.080 --> 02:01.080
I got in at four.

02:01.680 --> 02:03.000
Completely smashed.

02:03.560 --> 02:05.480
Covered in kebab and fanny juice.

02:06.240 --> 02:07.200
Don't ask me how.

02:07.760 --> 02:08.720
I wasn't gonna.

02:08.800 --> 02:11.560
Did too much chang,
so I was lying in bed doing the luge...

02:11.640 --> 02:15.000
till the alarm went off,
then, boom, shower! Coffee.

02:15.080 --> 02:17.880
Suit straight down the dry cleaners. Work.

02:20.440 --> 02:22.200
I got home and I cried a little bit.

02:22.600 --> 02:24.960
Dry cleaners are used to it.
I've shat myself twice.

02:26.280 --> 02:28.120
[clicks tongue] Right. Um...

02:28.840 --> 02:31.480
-Just, sorry, to go back to... me.
-[therapist sighs]

02:32.320 --> 02:33.320
I, um...

02:33.960 --> 02:37.200
I think that I was crying
because I don't want to give up on her,

02:37.280 --> 02:41.880
you know, I don't want to give up on us.
And... all I want to do is

02:41.960 --> 02:44.320
just... talk to her and beg her

02:44.400 --> 02:46.320
to let us go back to how it was.

02:46.400 --> 02:48.880
-Matt--
-But I don't want to stifle her. I don't--

02:48.960 --> 02:50.760
-Women don't want this.
-Yeah.

02:50.840 --> 02:52.600
OK? It's pathetic.

02:53.560 --> 02:54.440
Begging.

02:55.040 --> 02:57.400
[scoffs] How is that good for a family?

02:59.560 --> 03:03.200
Females choose mates
based on their strength.

03:03.760 --> 03:05.480
OK? On their power.

03:06.680 --> 03:08.400
Their capabilities to provide...

03:09.200 --> 03:10.360
and keep them safe.

03:12.240 --> 03:14.680
We're descended
from fucking cavemen, Matt.

03:16.040 --> 03:18.160
We go out,
we kill a saber-toothed tiger,

03:18.240 --> 03:19.600
we bring it back, we share it out,

03:19.680 --> 03:22.200
and then we give the fittest bird
a good fucking seeing to.

03:23.200 --> 03:24.480
That's where we're from.

03:26.240 --> 03:29.120
Yeah, I just don't think
that's really... me.

03:29.200 --> 03:30.240
No, it's not.

03:32.080 --> 03:33.160
Being you

03:33.240 --> 03:36.120
will not win her back.
It's as simple as that.

03:36.200 --> 03:38.200
-You've tried that, didn't work.
-Yeah. No.

03:38.280 --> 03:39.640
She thinks you're a loser.

03:39.720 --> 03:40.560
Solution?

03:42.400 --> 03:44.520
Be something fucking better!

03:44.600 --> 03:46.280
Be something fucking stronger.

03:46.680 --> 03:47.640
-Yeah?
-Mm.

03:47.720 --> 03:48.640
Lie.

03:49.200 --> 03:50.040
Cheat.

03:50.840 --> 03:51.920
Just be a man.

03:54.440 --> 03:55.440
But not you.

03:56.360 --> 03:58.840
When did you start...
having all this done?

03:59.720 --> 04:01.200
[woman] 'Bout five years ago.

04:01.840 --> 04:04.360
Started on, like, botox...

04:04.440 --> 04:07.360
and, like, filler for wrinkles an' that.

04:08.600 --> 04:09.840
[Tony] How old were you?

04:10.240 --> 04:11.480
Early 20s.

04:12.680 --> 04:14.120
What wrinkles did you have?

04:14.200 --> 04:15.200
[woman groans]

04:15.280 --> 04:17.840
Dunno, like, frown lines an' that.

04:19.800 --> 04:22.040
-Right.
-[woman] Yeah, then I proper got into it.

04:22.120 --> 04:23.520
I just couldn't get enough.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.600
And then I got my lips done,

04:25.680 --> 04:27.560
and I had a bit of a reaction.

04:27.640 --> 04:29.640
But that settled down in the end.

04:29.720 --> 04:32.360
And then I wanted to go bigger,
then this happened.

04:33.200 --> 04:36.480
My whole face was paralyzed.
It's only just gone back to normal.

04:37.120 --> 04:38.880
-Has it?
-Yeah.

04:38.960 --> 04:40.080
My boobs leak.

04:41.480 --> 04:42.720
They're fakeÂ an' all.

04:43.160 --> 04:44.480
-Are they?
-[woman] Yeah.

04:44.560 --> 04:46.240
-I mean, rock hard.
-[dull tapping]

04:46.680 --> 04:48.320
-Right.
-[woman sighs]

04:48.800 --> 04:49.640
Yeah.

04:50.080 --> 04:53.760
Sorry, and that was the same guy...
that did your face?

04:53.840 --> 04:56.000
Yeah. I was furious.

04:56.080 --> 04:58.040
-Still am.
-[Tony] Are you?

04:58.880 --> 04:59.880
It's hard to tell.

04:59.960 --> 05:02.240
[woman] If you think
he botched my face and chest,

05:02.320 --> 05:03.680
you should see my minge.

05:04.840 --> 05:06.320
It's like a butcher's bin.

05:08.640 --> 05:09.560
Sorry,

05:10.000 --> 05:12.040
you went back to him to have your...

05:12.480 --> 05:14.520
-Minge.
-Yeah, I know. I didn't want to say the...

05:14.600 --> 05:18.080
Yeah, he did it for half price, though.
'Cause of how he'd ruined my face.

05:18.160 --> 05:19.000
[Tony] Right.

05:20.560 --> 05:22.480
Why would you want to have that done?

05:26.480 --> 05:27.840
I think I've got a problem.

05:29.360 --> 05:30.240
Yeah.

05:30.760 --> 05:31.880
I mean, it might be...

05:32.800 --> 05:34.000
like an addiction.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.560
-What, do you mean, like, I can't help it?
-[Tony] Well, I guess so,

05:38.640 --> 05:42.160
but... I mean, if you acknowledge it,
there's a chance you can...

05:42.800 --> 05:44.480
get... you know, get help.

05:44.560 --> 05:46.760
-Do you think I'm mental?
-Well... [sighs]

05:47.080 --> 05:48.400
No more than the rest of us.

05:49.720 --> 05:52.800
As I say, we're all screwed up
in one way or another.

05:52.880 --> 05:54.360
It sort of makes you normal.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
[strangled wail]

05:56.080 --> 05:57.240
[chuckles wryly]

05:57.320 --> 05:58.720
-Are you laughing?
-No.

05:58.800 --> 05:59.720
[Tony] Crying?

06:00.120 --> 06:01.000
-Oh.
-[Tony] Oh...

06:01.080 --> 06:01.920
Um...

06:02.480 --> 06:04.280
No, they've fucked my tear ducts.

06:06.400 --> 06:08.480
-[sighs] Take a picture.
-Yeah.

06:08.880 --> 06:10.080
[woman sniffs, clears throat]

06:11.440 --> 06:12.400
[camera clicks]

06:12.480 --> 06:14.400
-[woman] Got it?
-[Lenny] Yeah. Great.

06:19.240 --> 06:20.480
-Hiya.
-[Matt] Hey.

06:22.600 --> 06:24.880
Are you going
to that am-dram cabaret thing?

06:26.200 --> 06:27.440
I dunno. Why?

06:28.000 --> 06:30.400
Well... wondered if you'd like
to come with me?

06:31.520 --> 06:33.920
-What do you mean? You mean you're going?
-[Kath] Yeah.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.800
Thought we could have a drink before
and sit together.

06:38.760 --> 06:40.480
Right. I'm not sure if I'm going.

06:40.840 --> 06:43.160
Right. Well, would you like to go...

06:44.080 --> 06:45.040
with me?

06:46.240 --> 06:48.960
Well, with everyone, really.
Everyone's going. We'd all be there.

06:49.040 --> 06:51.280
Yeah, but I'm saying
would you like to sit with me?

06:52.280 --> 06:54.200
But I don't know if I'm going.
And we don't know

06:54.280 --> 06:55.960
-what seats will be free.
-If you don't want

06:56.040 --> 06:57.760
-to go with me, just say.
-No, it's not that.

06:57.840 --> 07:00.520
-I haven't even checked my diary.
-Well, go on, then.

07:00.600 --> 07:02.640
-What?
-Well, check it. It's right there.

07:03.920 --> 07:06.480
Oh, no.
It's hardly on the right page, is it?

07:11.680 --> 07:16.040
-There's nothing in there at the moment.
-Yeah. Right. Well, I'll, uh...

07:17.280 --> 07:18.640
pencil that in, then.

07:19.920 --> 07:22.360
Um, I will have to check my master diary
as well.

07:22.440 --> 07:24.480
-You've got a master diary?
-Yeah.

07:24.560 --> 07:27.160
I've got work here,
and then personal at home,

07:27.240 --> 07:30.800
so I tend to mix and match,
actually, so... Tony?

07:30.880 --> 07:33.000
Can I just... Sorry, Kath, I've got...

07:33.080 --> 07:34.560
Tony, we've got our, um...

07:36.040 --> 07:36.920
meeting.

07:39.560 --> 07:41.040
Um... Shut the door.

07:46.160 --> 07:48.440
Kath just asked me to sit next to her
at the cabaret thing.

07:48.520 --> 07:49.520
Great.

07:49.600 --> 07:51.320
-I need to get out of it.
-Why?

07:51.400 --> 07:53.920
-Please help me get out of it. Please.
-How?

07:54.480 --> 07:56.280
Say you're thinking
of killing yourself again.

07:57.400 --> 07:59.960
Say I'm thinking
of killing myself next Thursday?

08:00.040 --> 08:01.400
Well, I'll tell her, then.

08:01.480 --> 08:05.240
You'll tell her you can't go with her
'cause I'm thinking of killing myself?

08:06.000 --> 08:07.720
I'm not saying
I'm thinking of killing myself

08:07.800 --> 08:10.400
'cause you're too chicken to say
you don't want to go on a date.

08:10.480 --> 08:12.400
[sighs] For fuck's sake,
it's just a favor.

08:12.480 --> 08:14.560
And do you know the fable,
<i>The Boy Who Cried Wolf?</i>

08:14.640 --> 08:16.200
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Right.

08:16.280 --> 08:18.840
So, what happens when
I really am thinking of killing myself,

08:18.920 --> 08:22.360
and everyone goes, "Nah, he's just trying
to get his cowardly brother-in-law

08:22.440 --> 08:23.480
out of a date"?

08:24.200 --> 08:27.160
Well, no, that's different in that case,
isn't it?

08:27.240 --> 08:29.640
'Cause he admitted it.
He was like, "Nah, only joking."

08:29.720 --> 08:31.080
So they all knew he was lying.

08:31.160 --> 08:33.120
And he kept doing it, so it was obvious.

08:33.200 --> 08:35.480
We'll only use this lie once,
and we'll never admit to it.

08:35.560 --> 08:40.160
So, the moral of that fable is:
"Never admit you were lying,

08:40.240 --> 08:41.320
-ever..."
-Yeah.

08:41.400 --> 08:44.920
"...and always use different lies
each time"?

08:45.520 --> 08:46.440
Yeah.

08:46.520 --> 08:47.760
Nice message.

08:47.840 --> 08:48.800
-No.
-Come on.

08:48.880 --> 08:49.720
No.

08:50.040 --> 08:51.720
-Fuck's sake.
-You're on your own.

08:52.920 --> 08:53.960
[door closes]

08:54.040 --> 08:56.040
[sentimental music plays]

09:03.280 --> 09:05.080
[birds chirping]

09:28.760 --> 09:30.040
[Tony] There we go, Dad.

09:33.200 --> 09:34.080
Good.

09:34.160 --> 09:35.400
There. You're all right.

09:36.360 --> 09:38.200
-Hi.
-Hiya.

09:38.280 --> 09:40.120
[Tony's dad breathes out heavily]

09:42.200 --> 09:45.040
Tony, I'm not going to sit around
and wait for you to make a move,

09:45.120 --> 09:46.400
I have to get on with my life.

09:47.680 --> 09:50.080
-Why are you acting weird?
<i>-I'm </i>acting weird?

09:50.160 --> 09:51.560
For fuck's sake, Tony!

09:51.640 --> 09:53.400
I'm just a bit fed up, all right?

09:53.480 --> 09:56.040
-My wife died. My dad--
-Yes, I know.

09:56.120 --> 09:57.600
Oh, sorry if that bores you.

09:57.680 --> 09:59.920
Seriously? Fucking hell.

10:01.120 --> 10:02.200
Was it just a drink?

10:03.080 --> 10:03.920
Fuck's sake.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.040
It's just a question. Was it just a drink?

10:06.120 --> 10:08.360
[exasperated] Yes, it was just a drink!

10:09.040 --> 10:10.680
OK. Good.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.200
[plumps pillow]

10:13.280 --> 10:15.640
But it might not always be
just a drink, though.

10:23.840 --> 10:25.560
Dad, say, "Simon is a cunt."

10:27.200 --> 10:28.040
What?

10:29.480 --> 10:30.720
"Simon is a cunt."

-Yeah.
-"Simon is a cunt."

10:38.720 --> 10:39.720
Remember that.

[wistful instrumental music plays]

10:46.080 --> 10:47.040
[nurse] All right?

10:47.920 --> 10:50.360
-Is it OK? Not too hot?
-[woman] No, it's good.

10:50.440 --> 10:52.280
[nurse] Yeah. Manage another one?

10:53.520 --> 10:56.240

if you eat this. That's it.

That's better, eh? OK?

11:03.720 --> 11:04.880
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

11:07.960 --> 11:08.840
Hi.

11:09.360 --> 11:11.480
-Hi.
-I've brought you a few jumpers.

11:11.560 --> 11:14.680
-It's getting a bit chillier outside.
-Great. Thanks.

11:14.760 --> 11:18.160
[chuckles lightly] I mean, yeah,
can never have too many jumpers.

11:18.240 --> 11:20.560
Um... I was gonna call you, actually.

11:20.640 --> 11:22.160
Um, you know the cabaret thing

11:22.240 --> 11:23.600
-that they're doing?
-Yeah.

11:24.560 --> 11:26.080
I wondered if you wanted to come.

11:26.600 --> 11:28.640
I'd have to sort a babysitter.

11:28.720 --> 11:30.600
No, you can bring George.
It's for everyone.

11:31.200 --> 11:32.880
Oh... I'm not sure.

11:33.520 --> 11:36.320
Yeah. Um...
You'd be doing me a favor, actually.

11:36.800 --> 11:39.000
-Kath's asked me to go with her.
-Why?

11:40.280 --> 11:41.960
I think she's got a thing for me.

11:42.040 --> 11:43.360
Well, tell her you can't

11:43.440 --> 11:45.400
'cause you're going
with your wife and child.

11:46.400 --> 11:47.600
Right. Yeah.

11:49.160 --> 11:51.640
-Uh...
-I mean, it's nice of her, though, really,

11:51.720 --> 11:53.840
'cause she probably thought
you were lonely.

11:53.920 --> 11:55.240
-Probably.
-Yeah.

11:55.320 --> 11:56.840
I was thinking of coming,

11:56.920 --> 11:59.080
I just didn't know
whether George would be allowed.

11:59.160 --> 12:01.120
-He is, yeah.
-That's good, yeah.

12:01.200 --> 12:04.200
-OK, well... I'd better go.
-Yeah.

12:04.280 --> 12:06.960

-Um, but I'll see you later.

-Yeah?

I'm gonna go with Jill and George.

Do you want a coffee?

Why?

Dunno, 'cause it tastes nice?

let's go for a nice coffee, and...

talk about really interesting things

-Thanks.

13:31.800 --> 13:33.240
[Tony sighs tiredly]

13:35.120 --> 13:37.280
Did I embarrass myself with Matt, then?

13:37.360 --> 13:38.360
Definitely not.

13:38.920 --> 13:41.280
Why would you be embarrassed
about being honest

13:41.360 --> 13:43.400
and saying something nice?
He should be flattered.

13:43.480 --> 13:44.720
I think he was scared!

13:45.480 --> 13:47.760
[chuckles sadly]
I'm obviously not his type.

13:48.720 --> 13:50.320
Someone just got there first.

13:50.400 --> 13:52.960
But, um... you didn't do anything wrong.

13:53.040 --> 13:54.360
You showed your feelings.

13:55.040 --> 13:56.040
That's good.

13:56.880 --> 13:58.600
I wish I'd shown my feelings more.

13:59.360 --> 14:01.000
With Lisa. Um...

14:01.640 --> 14:02.480
I...

14:03.720 --> 14:06.680
Sometimes, I'd be embarrassed
to hold hands in public.

14:07.600 --> 14:10.480
Or if we were on the phone
and there was people around,

14:10.880 --> 14:13.160
she'd always say, "Bye. Love you."

14:13.240 --> 14:15.200
And I would go, "Me too."

14:15.280 --> 14:17.200
And she'd laugh, 'cause she'd know.

14:18.040 --> 14:18.880
Yeah.

14:19.440 --> 14:21.120
Sometimes, I was out, working late.

14:21.200 --> 14:23.600
The phone would go, and I'd think,
"Oh, God, what's happened?"

14:23.680 --> 14:26.520
And I'd go, "Hello?"
I'd go, "What's wrong?" And, um...

14:27.800 --> 14:30.160
she'd say,
"Nothing's wrong, I just love you."

you'll meet someone, and it'll be...

Life will be brilliant.

Oh, and thanks for telling me that thing
about your wife calling you.

It was lovely.

-See you later.
-See you later.

15:49.040 --> 15:50.440
[Tony] Bad day, I'm afraid.

15:54.840 --> 15:57.240
The last thing you should do
is drink alone.

16:04.000 --> 16:04.840
Mm...

16:06.200 --> 16:07.040
Nice.

16:08.200 --> 16:10.200
[Tony] Lisa was my greatest achievement.

16:11.360 --> 16:14.840
I've never done anything else, really.
Not of worth.

16:16.640 --> 16:18.160
Nothing else to be proud of.

16:20.040 --> 16:21.040
Just that.

16:22.640 --> 16:23.680
I won at life.

16:25.920 --> 16:26.920
You did.

16:30.200 --> 16:33.280
I'm not as good as her,
and I'm proud of that. [chuckles]

16:33.880 --> 16:35.040
You're just different.

16:36.720 --> 16:39.360
I'm angry. I'm petty. I'm sad.

16:39.440 --> 16:42.320
I'm jealous of anyone
who's still got someone.

16:45.560 --> 16:47.920
How did you get Lisa if you were so bad?

16:49.720 --> 16:50.720
I'm not sure.

16:52.840 --> 16:54.440
I was just nice to her, I think.

16:54.920 --> 16:56.440
You should try that again.

[both chuckle]

I miss her so much.

17:11.560 --> 17:14.680
I lost most of me, and all the good stuff,
all the happiness...

17:15.280 --> 17:16.480
any joy in anything...

17:19.760 --> 17:21.600
I feel like I'm nothing, you know?

17:21.680 --> 17:22.960
That's not true.

I'm snarky now and again,

17:27.840 --> 17:30.120

but it's not.

This is me all the time now.

17:34.200 --> 17:36.360
Everything else is the front, you know?

17:37.160 --> 17:38.520
I'm not well, but I remember

17:38.600 --> 17:41.040
what it was like to be normal,
so I do an impression of that.

17:42.920 --> 17:44.960
But this is what I really am.

And I want to be normal again...

I tried to be brave and put a...

17:54.080 --> 17:56.080
you know, a face on, to be positive,

17:56.680 --> 18:00.160
and even then, I'd break down sometimes,
and she'd... [voice cracks]

18:01.600 --> 18:02.840
...have to comfort me.

18:04.240 --> 18:07.880
I couldn't even give her that.
When she was dying, she was still on duty.

and sell the building?

No.

Please don't.

A lot of people rely on it. And, um...

I mean, how much will you make
from selling it?

20:00.880 --> 20:01.880
Half a million.

20:04.040 --> 20:05.600
Right... Yeah.

That's a lot.

No, it's just that, you know, if, um...

if I don't cash in my chips soon,
you know, none of my...

20:29.560 --> 20:31.440
I might kick the bucket,
then it'd be too late.

20:32.560 --> 20:35.640
I mean, it's not as if I need anything
as such, it's, uh...

20:36.240 --> 20:37.600
Although... [chuckles lightly]

20:38.960 --> 20:42.160
...I wouldn't say no
to the company of a nice lady.

20:42.240 --> 20:43.240
[chuckles]

20:45.640 --> 20:46.920
That's all that matters.

20:48.640 --> 20:51.000
I had the best marriage imaginable.

20:52.000 --> 20:52.840
Magical.

20:53.480 --> 20:54.360
Uh...

20:54.880 --> 20:58.040
So, when, um, Lisa, my wife,

20:58.120 --> 20:59.480
when she died,

20:59.560 --> 21:02.080
I was suicidal, and depressed.

21:02.160 --> 21:05.120
And everyone was so nice,
everyone tried to help me and...

21:05.200 --> 21:09.400
they sort of saved me, so...
I wanted to do something nice back.

21:10.000 --> 21:13.840
But, um, anyway, you're a nice guy,
and I just want you to know,

21:14.800 --> 21:16.760
you know, the whole story, and, uh...

21:17.720 --> 21:20.000
I mean, if you weren't to sell it, um,

21:20.080 --> 21:22.880
we could... you know, give it another go.

21:23.280 --> 21:25.720
If it didn't work out,
you could sell it next year.

21:26.160 --> 21:27.400
It might work, and...

21:28.000 --> 21:31.560
we could do with someone...
who cared about... success,

21:31.640 --> 21:34.120
'cause we are the biggest bunch
of losers you will ever meet.

to have a challenge again.

-You. Do it again.

-I could just dance.
-Sing and dance.

-Can I do the dance on its own?

-I'm so sorry you had to see that.
-It's OK.

22:30.120 --> 22:32.320
I don't normally lose it like that.
I just...

22:32.680 --> 22:35.280
I'm trying to create the best scenario.

22:35.360 --> 22:36.960
You can do it without the words.

-Thanks, Ken.
-Just the dance.

22:38.360 --> 22:39.840
-Is that what you want to do?
-Yeah.

22:39.920 --> 22:42.880
If that makes you happy,
even if it's shit, and it will be,

22:42.960 --> 22:44.680
I want you to be happy, all right?

22:44.760 --> 22:46.800
-Thanks, Ken.
-This is why we do it. It's all right.

22:46.880 --> 22:49.040
Hey, have I told you
about my sister's anus yet?

22:49.440 --> 22:51.600
-Uh... I don't think so.
-Right, listen up.

22:52.120 --> 22:54.080
Silly cow is only having it bleached.

22:54.520 --> 22:58.000
Bleached! That's a thing now,
bleaching your anus.

22:58.080 --> 23:00.120
-[Sandy] Right.
-[Ken] I said, "For the love of God,Â 

23:00.200 --> 23:02.240
why are you doing that?"
She said, "So it looks nice."

23:02.320 --> 23:04.320
I said, "Fuck me, who's gonna see that?"

23:04.400 --> 23:07.320
More people are going to see mine,
and mine's like a fucking compost heap.

23:07.400 --> 23:09.560
I think we should probably just watch.

23:09.640 --> 23:12.520
-What were you talking about?
-I was telling her about my sister's anus.

23:12.840 --> 23:16.000
I'm fascinated with the anus.
Always have been, always will be.

23:16.840 --> 23:19.360
The man who is tired of the anus
is tired of life.

23:21.160 --> 23:24.240
-You can quote me on that. [chuckles]
-OK, thanks.

23:25.400 --> 23:27.240
How's your material going?

23:27.320 --> 23:28.360
Gonna keep it loose.

23:28.840 --> 23:31.240
I'm sort of
like a performance artist, so...

23:31.320 --> 23:33.200
I can't be constrained in the normal way.

23:33.280 --> 23:35.680
Well, you've got ten minutes,
so you better keep it that tight.

23:35.760 --> 23:38.360
Ten minutes?
I can't do everything in ten minutes.

23:38.440 --> 23:41.360
Oh, fuck this! Sort it out between you.
I'm off for a vape.

23:41.440 --> 23:44.080
[stomping feet]
If you want me, I'll be in the disableds.

23:44.160 --> 23:45.880
[door opens, closes]

23:51.160 --> 23:52.160
You all right?

23:52.840 --> 23:54.080
-Yeah.
-How's it going?

23:54.640 --> 23:57.240
Just got a great scoop
on Ken Otley's sister's anus.

23:57.320 --> 23:59.000
-[sniggers]
-It's bleached.

23:59.520 --> 24:00.840
Good. Well...

24:01.560 --> 24:05.120
you might have to cover these sort
of stories for a little while longer,

24:05.600 --> 24:08.120
'cause Paul's agreed
not to close the paper.

24:08.800 --> 24:09.880
-Really?
-Yeah.

24:11.280 --> 24:12.400
Oh, thank you!

24:12.480 --> 24:13.600
-Don't cry.
-[giggles]

24:14.000 --> 24:15.160
You work so hard.

24:18.080 --> 24:19.080
You're great.

24:19.720 --> 24:21.880
-Thanks.
-All right.

24:26.280 --> 24:27.560
[breathes out shakily]

24:27.800 --> 24:29.160
[upbeat music plays]

24:33.280 --> 24:36.480
[Lisa] <i>Aww! Look at her!</i>
<i>Brandy! What's this?</i>

24:36.560 --> 24:39.040
-[Tony] <i>She looks like a... cartoon mouse.</i>
<i>-What is this?</i>

24:39.120 --> 24:41.360
-[Tony] I don't...
-[Lisa and Tony cackle]

24:42.760 --> 24:45.120
<i>Get your dildo, Brand.</i>
<i>Get your dildo!</i>

24:45.200 --> 24:47.400
[both laugh raucously]

24:48.040 --> 24:49.600
[Lisa] <i>Good girl!</i>

24:51.040 --> 24:54.040
<i>Brandy, say, "Sausages!"</i>

24:54.880 --> 24:58.240
-[Tony laughs]
-âª <i>Once we were loversÂ âª</i>

25:02.000 --> 25:04.880
<i>âª Can they understand?Â âª</i>

25:08.760 --> 25:12.400
<i>âª Closer than others, I was yourÂ âª</i>

25:15.320 --> 25:17.720
âª <i>I was your manÂ âª</i>

25:22.000 --> 25:24.480
<i>âª Don't talk of heartachesÂ âª</i>

25:25.680 --> 25:30.320
<i>âª Oh, I remember them allÂ âª</i>

25:34.600 --> 25:38.720
<i>âª When I'm checking you out</i>
<i>One day... âª</i>
