00:01.710 --> 00:03.060
oh,oh,that is so true.

00:03.070 --> 00:04.590
I know exactly what you mean.

00:06.810 --> 00:08.710
- Oh,hey,charlie.
- Hey.

00:08.720 --> 00:10.050
What's going on?

00:10.060 --> 00:13.270
Oh,I just have a friend over from 
my single parent support group.

00:13.280 --> 00:14.950
Oh,yeah.Unattached moms.

00:14.960 --> 00:16.980
I got to check out that group.

00:18.620 --> 00:20.370
But you don't have a kid.

00:20.380 --> 00:22.710
Are they really strict about that?

00:23.810 --> 00:25.690
'Cause,at the dog park,
you just show up with a leash and say,

00:25.700 --> 00:28.040
that's him by the tree.

00:28.800 --> 00:30.590
It's a single parent group.

00:30.600 --> 00:32.189
You need to be a single parent.

00:32.200 --> 00:35.430
Seems a little prejudiced,if you ask me.

00:35.730 --> 00:39.750
Hey,alan,can I use your bathroom

00:39.760 --> 00:41.150
It's right down the hall.

00:41.160 --> 00:43.760
Oh,greg,this is my brother charlie.
Charlie,greg.

00:43.770 --> 00:44.760

- Nice place.
- Thanks.

00:48.960 --> 00:51.430
*****

00:51.440 --> 00:52.830
Greg's a divorced dad.

00:52.840 --> 00:54.990
He's got a daughter around jake's age.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.700
Well,you can understand my confusion.

00:57.710 --> 00:59.940
You think I joined a support group 
to pick up women?

00:59.950 --> 01:03.550
No.I think you joined a support group *****

01:04.780 --> 01:07.880
******

01:08.850 --> 01:10.670
Sex is not what the group's about.

01:10.680 --> 01:12.240
Oh,grow up.

01:12.310 --> 01:15.310
*****in folding chairs in a church basement,

******

01:22.630 --> 01:25.160
Really?Still?

01:25.490 --> 01:30.470
***By the stack of racing forms 
next to the can,you bet the ponies.

01:30.480 --> 01:33.480
Hey,I'd bet on rabbits 
if you could get 'em organized.

01:34.750 --> 01:37.710
Is there a story behind that 
riding crop hanging on the wall?

01:37.720 --> 01:41.660
Oh,yeah-- that's a souvenir from 
a wonderful weekend in louisville,kentucky.

01:41.670 --> 01:42.630
Oh,you went to the derby?

01:42.640 --> 01:45.430
Nah.It was a hilton by the airport.

01:46.620 --> 01:48.130
How about you? 
Do you hit the track?

01:48.210 --> 01:51.820
Yeah.It's actually my second biggest
 expense after alimony.

01:51.830 --> 01:54.900
******

01:55.790 --> 01:58.610
-Hey,your brother's funny.
-At first

01:59.770 --> 02:01.740
I'll get us some more beers.

02:01.750 --> 02:03.950
Charlie,you smoke cigars?

02:03.960 --> 02:06.520
I'd smoke rabbits if you could keep 'em lit.

02:10.520 --> 02:14.510
-So,divorced dad,huh?
-Yep.

02:15.340 --> 02:17.930
-How long were you married?
-16years

02:19.110 --> 02:22.120

Cheating?Drinking?Gambling?

Gay.

02:52.240 --> 02:55.700
Are you kidding?

02:56.970 --> 03:00.610
- A confirmed bachelor.
- No,no,no.Nothing's confirmed.

03:01.320 --> 03:04.190
I mean,I just think that variety 
is the spice of life.

03:04.200 --> 03:06.690
And as far as spices go,some people like salt

03:06.700 --> 03:09.320
some people like pepper,some people 
like salt and pepper.

03:09.330 --> 03:11.550
Me,I like women.

03:14.760 --> 03:16.590
Me,too.
Some of my best friends are women.

None of my friends are women.

03:22.110 --> 03:25.070

03:25.080 --> 03:27.220
Oh,damn.I'm going to have to take 
a rain check on that beer.

03:27.230 --> 03:29.300
- I got to get going.
- Oh,okay.

03:29.310 --> 03:31.610
- We still on for sunday?
- Looking forward to it.

03:31.620 --> 03:34.410
Really nice meeting you,charlie.
*******

03:34.430 --> 03:35.490
You never know.

03:35.500 --> 03:37.400
Do you like santa anita or hollywood park?

03:37.410 --> 03:39.150

03:41.920 --> 03:44.020
Oh,he's bad.

- Okay,so I'll see you sunday.
- Bye-bye.

03:49.130 --> 03:51.390
- Adios.
- Great guy,huh?

03:51.400 --> 03:53.460
Yeah.Yeah,terrific.

03:54.200 --> 03:55.260
How much do you know about him?

03:55.270 --> 03:58.300
Well,I know he's a successful architect,

03:58.310 --> 04:01.190
his daughter is a soccer player,he's gay,

04:01.200 --> 04:02.990
he has a boat,he went to U.C.Berkeley...

04:03.000 --> 04:05.100
okay,okay.Back up a little.

04:05.740 --> 04:08.070
*****
Well,it's more of a sloop.

04:09.700 --> 04:11.210
He's taking me and jake out on sunday.

04:11.220 --> 04:13.200
No,no,no,no,no.One more.

04:13.210 --> 04:15.670
What,he's gay?
What about it?

04:15.680 --> 04:18.420
Nothing.I'm just looking out for you.

04:20.060 --> 04:23.720
I mean,does he want to take you sailing,
or does he want to take you sailing?

04:29.160 --> 04:31.370
Don't be silly.
He knows I'm not gay.

04:31.380 --> 04:33.370
Are you sure?

04:33.380 --> 04:36.300
For 16 years,he didn't know he was gay.

04:36.880 --> 04:37.620
Come on,charlie.

04:37.630 --> 04:40.240
You don't believe two men can be friends
just because one of them is gay?

04:40.600 --> 04:43.600
It has nothing to do with gay.

04:43.610 --> 04:47.810
Imagine he were a straight guy and 
you were an attractive young woman.

04:47.820 --> 04:49.790
Do you think you could just be friends?

04:49.800 --> 04:52.000
How attractive?

04:53.650 --> 04:58.030
I mean,you know,am I kind of 
cute in a tomboy sort of way

04:58.040 --> 05:01.920
or am I smokin' hot and workin' it?

05:05.010 --> 05:07.990
Okay,okay.Let's start again.

05:09.060 --> 05:13.170
Imagine you were a straight guy...

05:14.390 --> 05:18.020
- And?
- No and.That's it.

05:22.970 --> 05:25.910
*******

05:25.950 --> 05:28.280
Define working.

05:28.970 --> 05:30.970
What kind of hair conditioner do I use?

05:32.660 --> 05:34.720
I quite.

05:36.810 --> 05:41.180
I use a wash-out conditioner,
then blow-dry with a dab of styling gel.

05:41.190 --> 05:43.960
But you got me a leave-in conditioner.

05:43.970 --> 05:46.170
Why would you get me a leave-in conditioner?

05:46.180 --> 05:47.850
- The truth?
- Please.

05:47.860 --> 05:50.410
It came with a free lady schick.

05:50.900 --> 05:52.860
Berta,my hair is important to me.

05:52.870 --> 05:55.240
All right.
Don't get your panties in a bunch.

06:06.940 --> 06:11.670
I just like having extra body without,
you know,stiffness!

06:17.440 --> 06:20.640
Why don't you guys go hang outside 
while we throw together some lunch?

06:20.640 --> 06:22.350
Okay.Come on,sophie.

06:22.350 --> 06:23.850
- This is a cool house.
- Yeah.

06:23.850 --> 06:27.100

like puffin' on.

06:48.300 --> 06:49.650
That's sweet.Thank you.

06:49.650 --> 06:51.610
You're very welcome.

06:54.430 --> 06:56.140
Did you do something different with your hair?

06:56.140 --> 06:59.930
- It looks nice.
- Don't get me started.

07:01.780 --> 07:05.420
-****

07:05.420 --> 07:07.820
- That he's gay.
- My dad's not gay.

07:07.820 --> 07:10.090
You sure?My dad is.

07:10.090 --> 07:12.340

07:34.940 --> 07:37.750
Can we watch a soccer game instead of basketball?

07:37.930 --> 07:40.400
What are you,nuts?

07:40.400 --> 07:43.030
Sophie says soccer's the most popular 
sport in the world.

07:43.030 --> 07:46.030
Well,then they don't need us to watch it.

07:49.740 --> 07:51.820
You know what would be a good idea?

07:51.820 --> 07:55.770
Maple syrup lip gloss.

07:58.890 --> 08:01.540
Your mom will be here any minute.
I thought I told you to get ready.

08:01.540 --> 08:02.360
I'm ready.

08:02.360 --> 08:03.920
- Did you do your homework?
- No.

08:03.920 --> 08:07.440
Oh,jake,I promised your mother you 
would have it done.

08:07.440 --> 08:10.950
Well,next time,you'll know better.

08:19.520 --> 08:23.060
I think jake has a thing for your 
boyfriend's daughter.

08:25.150 --> 08:27.270
He's not my boyfriend.
We're friends.

08:27.270 --> 08:29.130
Friends,huh?

08:29.130 --> 08:31.460
Alan,when an intelligent,successful

08:31.460 --> 08:37.169
attractive man wants to be friends with you,
something's amiss.

08:37.929 --> 08:40.240
Excuse me,but if greg were to be interested in

08:40.240 --> 08:43.370
anybody around here,it would be you.

08:43.370 --> 08:46.970
Whoa,whoa,whoa,whoa.

08:47.370 --> 08:49.180
What are you talking about?

08:49.380 --> 08:51.550
*****

08:51.550 --> 08:54.480
You put out a special kind of vibe.

08:55.600 --> 08:57.060
You don't mean special.

08:57.060 --> 08:59.710
You mean special!

09:01.090 --> 09:03.180
And I don'T.

09:03.180 --> 09:06.180
You're 40 years old,you've never been married

09:06.180 --> 09:10.140
you play the piano,you are meticulous 
about your appearance...

09:10.140 --> 09:14.740
I've got a riding crop in my bathroom

09:15.380 --> 09:17.810
Your bathroom also has two kinds of 
skin moisturizer,

09:17.810 --> 09:22.280
various hair gels,colognes,powders and emollients.

09:22.280 --> 09:23.840
I only have one moisturizer.

09:23.840 --> 09:27.110
The other one is a sun block with moisturizer.

09:27.110 --> 09:28.530
Oh,right,right.

09:28.530 --> 09:32.700
You need that sun block for when you 
lean out the front door to get the paper.

09:33.430 --> 09:36.440
There's no shade out there in the morning,alan.

09:37.240 --> 09:41.350
Excuse me for not wanting to spend my 
50s looking like a catcher's mitt.

09:41.350 --> 09:46.140
All right,let's scoot away from the 
clinique counter for a minute...

09:49.380 --> 09:52.450
And discuss some of the people you've attracted.

09:52.450 --> 09:55.450
*******

09:55.450 --> 09:59.070
And there's no way I could have known
that was a guy.

09:59.070 --> 10:02.950
He was 6'2",and could palm a medicine ball.

10:03.940 --> 10:08.600
I was drunk,he was tucked,taped and gorgeous.

10:09.510 --> 10:13.530
Charlie,you brought home a dude in a dress.

10:13.890 --> 10:16.550
A dude who wanted to be a woman

10:16.550 --> 10:18.900
which means 
he was looking for a straight man

10:18.900 --> 10:20.680
which is me!

10:20.680 --> 10:23.240
Rationalize it any way you want,

10:23.240 --> 10:27.030
but he still sends you flowers on valentine's day.

10:28.580 --> 10:31.490
Only because I was a gentleman!

10:33.120 --> 10:35.870
- So,how was your weekend?
- It was okay.

10:35.870 --> 10:38.550
- We went sailing.
- Oh,how nice.

10:38.550 --> 10:41.640
- What else?
- Nothing.

10:46.210 --> 10:49.100
Oh,yeah.I think dad's gay now.

10:50.090 --> 10:52.980
That was a red light,mom.

10:53.440 --> 10:55.650
So,charlie,I haven't seen you in a while.

10:55.650 --> 10:57.370
What's up?

10:57.370 --> 10:58.730
Why does something have to be up?

10:58.730 --> 11:01.110
Can't I just drop by and say hello?

11:01.110 --> 11:05.200
At $350 an hour,you can say anything you want.

11:05.200 --> 11:08.980
Okay,well,there is something that's
 been kind of gnawing at me.

11:10.390 --> 11:14.360
- Well,this friend of mine...
- Your friend?

11:16.300 --> 11:18.440
Yeah,a friend.

11:18.440 --> 11:20.780
It's your money,charlie.

11:20.780 --> 11:25.540
Okay,okay,is it possible that,that,

11:25.540 --> 11:28.350
I could be gay without knowing it?

11:29.750 --> 11:31.150
Why do you ask?

11:31.150 --> 11:34.190
Well,my,my brother's got this friend...

11:34.190 --> 11:37.230
We're talking seven dollars a minute.

11:37.230 --> 11:39.940
No,no,no,no.
This friend's real.

11:39.940 --> 11:43.940
He's gay,and apparently,
I triggered his gaydar.

11:44.980 --> 11:46.430
*******

11:46.430 --> 11:50.090
You can?You can?

11:51.570 --> 11:55.200
Let me ask you something,charlie.
*******

11:55.200 --> 11:58.500
No!No,absolutely not!

12:04.570 --> 12:08.720
All right,I copped a feel once,
but I was drunk and he had breasts.

12:15.920 --> 12:17.520
********

12:17.520 --> 12:20.240
Jake,your father's here!

12:20.240 --> 12:22.640
- He'll be right out.
- Good.

12:25.040 --> 12:26.800
So,uh,how have you been?

12:26.800 --> 12:29.170
- Good,and you?
- Good.

12:32.210 --> 12:34.990
Oh,come here.
I'm so proud of you!

12:34.990 --> 12:37.580
Uh,thanks.
What did I do?

12:37.580 --> 12:39.380
Oh,alan,you don't have to hide anymore.

12:39.380 --> 12:40.650
Jake,told me all about you and greg,

12:40.650 --> 12:43.720
and I just want you to know 
I completely support you.

12:43.720 --> 12:45.700
- Oh,oh,gee,judith...
- Is that him in the car?

12:45.700 --> 12:48.820
Gee,he's cute.Hello!

12:48.820 --> 12:50.130
Oh,that must be his daughter.

12:50.130 --> 12:51.860
I can see why jake has a crush on her.

12:51.860 --> 12:53.240
*******

12:53.240 --> 12:57.230
Oh,this makes so much sense.
*******

12:57.230 --> 12:59.310
- See what?
- Oh,come on,alan.

12:59.410 --> 13:04.220
You picking out my clothes,your neat fetish,
the show tunes,the sex.

13:05.340 --> 13:07.720
- There was no sex.
- Exactly.

13:07.720 --> 13:09.760
All these years you were so miserable,
and look at you now.

13:09.760 --> 13:11.060
You're...glowing.

13:11.060 --> 13:12.630
*******

13:12.630 --> 13:15.890
The-the reason that there was no...

13:16.570 --> 13:18.500
Really?I'm glowing?

13:18.500 --> 13:22.260
And to think all this time I've been blaming 
myself bcause the marriage didn't work out.

13:22.260 --> 13:24.730
*********

13:24.730 --> 13:26.120
It was nobody's fault,alan.

13:26.120 --> 13:30.380
I'm just so glad that you finally accepted 
who you really are.

13:30.380 --> 13:32.520
- Hey,dad.
- Hey,buddy.

13:32.520 --> 13:34.290
Hey,sophie.

13:34.290 --> 13:36.950
You boys are so cute with your double dates.

13:36.960 --> 13:38.560
-****
-I almost forgot.

13:38.560 --> 13:42.490
Your mother told me to tell you that
 she's behind you 100%.

13:42.490 --> 13:44.660
When did you talk to my mother?

13:44.660 --> 13:47.110
Well,after jake told me,I called her.

13:47.440 --> 13:48.860
- Why?
- We have a little bet.

13:48.860 --> 13:52.040
It's not important.Okay,bye-bye!

13:55.770 --> 13:58.760
I mean,okay,I do care about my appearance.

13:58.760 --> 14:02.520
Plus,I've got mother issues and a bit 
of a flair for interior design.

14:03.720 --> 14:06.810
You know,sconces,throw pillows,bric-a-brac.

14:08.200 --> 14:10.830
But when it comes to penises,
I am pretty clear that

14:10.830 --> 14:14.250
The only one I want winking at me is my own.

14:16.130 --> 14:18.930
Who are you trying to convince here,
charlie,me or you?

14:18.930 --> 14:22.720
You.And than I want you to convince me.

14:22.720 --> 14:25.360
Why do you need convincing?

14:25.360 --> 14:27.740
- Wow,good question.
- Thanks.

14:27.740 --> 14:30.690
Once in a while I get a little wood on the balL.

14:31.840 --> 14:33.790
I mean,it has been suggested to me that

14:33.790 --> 14:37.590
all of my womanizing is just
 my way of overcompensating.

14:37.590 --> 14:39.740
And who suggested that?

14:39.740 --> 14:44.830
Uh,mostly the women I was overcompensating 
on top of.

14:44.830 --> 14:51.150
Well,this is a very interesting area,
but I'm afraid we're out of time.

14:51.150 --> 14:53.350
What?No,no,we can't stop here!

14:53.350 --> 14:55.650
I have a patient waiting,charlie.

14:55.650 --> 14:57.700
Hold on a sec.

15:00.680 --> 15:04.410
Here,go get yourself something to eat.
Come back in an hour.

15:08.210 --> 15:10.940
Okay,new clock.

15:12.430 --> 15:16.900
My mom took my temperature the baby way
till I was eight years old.

15:43.710 --> 15:45.620
- Hey,dad?
- Yeah?

15:45.620 --> 15:48.960
It's okay if I'm not gay,right?

15:55.550 --> 15:59.180
Jake,listen,you and i ******

15:59.210 --> 16:01.090
***********

16:01.090 --> 16:02.830
*********
What do you need to talk about?

16:02.830 --> 16:05.970
It's boy-girl,stuff.
You wouldn't understand.

16:09.230 --> 16:11.250
Hey,alan,your mom called.

16:11.250 --> 16:13.940
- She gave me the news.
- Oh,god.

16:14.800 --> 16:17.130
Come here.

16:17.460 --> 16:20.250
I'm proud of ya,zippy.

16:20.250 --> 16:25.200
The world is a much happier place once you figure 
out whether you're the pin or the cushion.

16:27.690 --> 16:30.070
Good night.

16:36.230 --> 16:39.300
- Charlie?
- Yeah?

16:39.300 --> 16:42.020
I think I might be gay.

16:43.250 --> 16:45.960
What did you do,alan?

16:45.960 --> 16:47.550
Nothing,but...

16:47.550 --> 16:50.300
I'm starting to put the pieces together.

16:50.300 --> 16:53.360
Which piece did you put where,alan?

16:55.170 --> 16:59.350
I'm just thinking that I failed at every 
female relationship I've ever had.

16:59.350 --> 17:03.380
Oh,come on.
That makes every man in the world gay.

17:04.770 --> 17:06.930
Let me finish.

17:06.930 --> 17:10.339
I've been unhappy for most of my life.

17:10.339 --> 17:13.869
I never really fit in anywhere.

17:13.869 --> 17:17.859
And now,suddenly,I'm happy.

17:17.859 --> 17:21.849
Some might even say I'm...glowing.

17:22.390 --> 17:26.700
There is a big leap between glowing 
and flaming.

17:29.240 --> 17:31.950
I'm just saying,this friendship with greg 
has been,you know,

17:31.950 --> 17:34.550
so easy and-and fun,

17:34.550 --> 17:38.550
and everybody else justseems happier
 thinking I'm gay.

17:39.570 --> 17:41.340
Maybe that's the answer.

17:41.340 --> 17:43.910
What was the question?

17:43.910 --> 17:46.300
Who is alan harper?

17:46.300 --> 17:49.730
Well,that's easy.
*******

17:51.010 --> 17:54.070
Why is my sexuality so threatening to you?

17:55.770 --> 17:57.220
It's not threatening.

17:57.220 --> 17:59.310
- I am not threatened.
- Is that so?

17:59.310 --> 18:03.200
Okay,okay,now you listen to me.

18:03.200 --> 18:05.560
You're not gay,I'm not gay.

18:05.560 --> 18:07.110
- Nobody's gay!
- Nobody's gay?

18:07.110 --> 18:09.930
Not in this house!

18:10.700 --> 18:12.460
Where are you going?

18:12.460 --> 18:15.800
I have to buy some new hair conditioner!

18:19.230 --> 18:22.000
- So that was a good meeting tonight.
- It was okay.

18:22.000 --> 18:25.220
But some of those single moms get real gossipy.

18:25.220 --> 18:27.920
Like rebecca milford?

18:28.980 --> 18:30.890
Did you see what she had on?

18:30.890 --> 18:34.240
Who could miss it?
A woman that size should not wear paisley.

18:35.370 --> 18:38.680
- Okay,thanks for the ride.
- Oh,no problem.

18:38.680 --> 18:40.880
So,we still taking the kids to the mall saturday?

18:40.880 --> 18:41.660
Are you kidding?

18:41.660 --> 18:45.370
I'm taking jake to the mall friday so he can 
have cool clothes to wear to the mall saturday.

18:46.420 --> 18:48.790
So maybe I'll see you there friday.

18:48.790 --> 18:51.450
Okay.Bye-bye.

18:53.110 --> 18:55.280
-Greg,wait.
-Yeah?

19:02.580 --> 19:04.430
Yeah?

19:04.430 --> 19:06.640
What are you doing?

19:07.430 --> 19:11.970
Uh,I was just,you know...checking.

19:12.720 --> 19:14.860
Checking what?

19:16.150 --> 19:19.780
I just thought,uh,that,you know,possibly...

19:20.400 --> 19:23.420
I might be...

19:23.420 --> 19:25.230
never mind.

19:25.230 --> 19:27.320
Alan,you're not gay.

19:27.320 --> 19:29.350
Are you sure?

19:29.350 --> 19:31.960
Do you find me sexually attractive?

19:32.660 --> 19:33.540
No.

19:33.540 --> 19:36.090
Do you find any man sexually attractive?

19:36.490 --> 19:37.400
No.

19:37.400 --> 19:40.470
Uh,maybe george clooney.

19:40.780 --> 19:42.160
Clooney doesn't count.

19:42.160 --> 19:46.020
Trust me.
You're not gay.

19:47.390 --> 19:49.710
Okay...

19:49.710 --> 19:52.470
You seem disappointed.

19:53.210 --> 19:54.440
I just...

19:54.440 --> 19:57.560
I feel like I'm letting a lot of people down.

19:58.580 --> 20:00.670
Alan...

20:00.990 --> 20:03.920
it's okay to be straight.

20:04.630 --> 20:06.160
I guess.

20:06.160 --> 20:08.370
So just to put all our cards on the table,you're,

20:08.370 --> 20:10.330
you're not at all attracted to me?

20:10.330 --> 20:12.320
No.You're not my type.

20:12.320 --> 20:14.650
- Now,charlie,on the other hand...
- What about him?

20:14.650 --> 20:17.760
He's,uh...very pretty.

20:18.490 --> 20:20.770
- Get out of my car!
- What?

20:20.770 --> 20:23.850
You think charlie's so pretty,
go to the mall with charlie.

20:23.850 --> 20:25.400
Come on,alan,we're friends.

20:25.400 --> 20:29.130
No,I'm always the friend.
Everybody wants charlie.

20:29.450 --> 20:30.850
You're not gay!

20:30.850 --> 20:34.780
Yeah,yeah,well,there's a principle involved.
Good night!

20:38.280 --> 20:40.550
Suit yourself.

20:46.590 --> 20:51.310
Well,at least I know who I am.

20:52.310 --> 20:55.700
*******

20:58.180 --> 21:00.920
I can't believe you broke up with sophie's dad.

21:01.910 --> 21:03.390
I didn'T...

21:04.440 --> 21:06.260
I'm not...

21:07.560 --> 21:10.040
I'm sorry.

21:10.900 --> 21:12.920
You know what would help this room?

21:12.920 --> 21:16.870
Get rid of all these lamps and
put in some track lighting.

21:16.870 --> 21:19.130
Much more flattering.

21:21.860 --> 21:25.720
- What are you eating?
- Lip gloss.
