WEBVTT

00:31.000 --> 00:33.700
>> John: WELCOME, WELCOME,

00:33.767 --> 00:34.667
WELCOME TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT!"

00:34.734 --> 00:35.700
I'M JOHN OLIVER, THANK YOU SO

00:35.767 --> 00:37.033
MUCH FOR JOINING US.

00:37.100 --> 00:38.400
JUST TIME FOR A QUICK RECAP OF

00:38.500 --> 00:40.066
THE WEEK, WHICH BROUGHT A SERIES

00:40.133 --> 00:42.200
OF SETBACKS FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP,

00:42.266 --> 00:43.934
VOTED WORLD'S SEXIEST MAN BY

00:44.000 --> 00:44.934
"IS THIS ENOUGH TO MAKE YOU

00:45.000 --> 00:46.934
GO AWAY?" MAGAZINE.

00:47.000 --> 00:47.900
TRUMP HAS HAD QUITE A WEEK,

00:47.967 --> 00:49.033
INCLUDING A SUMMIT WITH

00:49.100 --> 00:50.333
KIM JONG-UN WHERE HE FAILED TO

00:50.400 --> 00:51.700
GET AN AGREEMENT, DESPITE THE

00:51.767 --> 00:52.533
TWO OF THEM STANDING

00:52.600 --> 00:54.133
SHOULDER-TO-SHOULDER LIKE

00:54.200 --> 00:55.667
BROTHERS FORCED TO STAND OUTSIDE

00:55.734 --> 00:56.367
A MARSHALL'S CHANGING ROOM

00:56.433 --> 00:57.734
WEARING BACK-TO-SCHOOL CLOTHES

00:57.800 --> 00:58.734
THAT THEY DO NOT WANT MOM TO

00:58.800 --> 01:00.333
BUY.

01:00.400 --> 01:01.767
MEANWHILE, BACK IN THE U.S.,

01:01.834 --> 01:03.000
THERE WAS THE CONGRESSIONAL

01:03.066 --> 01:04.600
TESTIMONY OF TRUMP'S FORMER

01:04.667 --> 01:06.900
LAWYER AND LONGTIME YELL SPONGE

01:06.967 --> 01:07.934
MICHAEL COHEN, WHO GAVE US A

01:08.000 --> 01:09.800
GLIMPSE INTO WHAT TRUMP WAS LIKE

01:09.867 --> 01:11.600
AS A BOSS.

01:11.667 --> 01:13.166
>> HOW MANY TIMES DID MR. TRUMP

01:13.233 --> 01:14.400
ASK YOU TO THREATEN AN

01:14.467 --> 01:15.233
INDIVIDUAL OR ENTITY ON HIS

01:15.300 --> 01:18.066
BEHALF?

01:18.133 --> 01:19.867
>> QUITE A FEW TIMES.

01:19.934 --> 01:20.600
>> 50 TIMES?

01:20.667 --> 01:21.367
>> MORE.

01:21.433 --> 01:22.000
>> A HUNDRED TIMES?

01:22.066 --> 01:23.066
>> MORE.

01:23.133 --> 01:23.533
>> 200 TIMES?

01:23.600 --> 01:24.767
>> MORE.

01:24.834 --> 01:25.567
>> 500 TIMES?

01:25.633 --> 01:27.233
>> PROBABLY.

01:27.300 --> 01:28.200
>> John: WOW.

01:28.266 --> 01:33.867
THAT IS A LOT.

01:33.934 --> 01:35.433
ALTHOUGH HONESTLY I'M KIND OF

01:35.500 --> 01:36.867
DISAPPOINTED HE DIDN'T ISSUE

01:36.934 --> 01:38.367
525,600 THREATS, BECAUSE I WOULD

01:38.433 --> 01:39.767
HAVE LIKED TO SEE THE CAST OF

01:39.834 --> 01:40.900
"RENT" SPONTANEOUSLY APPEAR AND

01:40.967 --> 01:41.600
START DANCING IN THE BACKGROUND.

01:41.667 --> 01:42.367
OVER THE COURSE OF THE HEARING,

01:42.433 --> 01:43.300
COHEN DESCRIBED SEVERAL POSSIBLE

01:43.367 --> 01:44.367
CRIMES BY HIS FORMER BOSS, FROM

01:44.433 --> 01:45.567
SUBORNING PERJURY TO CAMPAIGN

01:45.633 --> 01:46.900
FINANCE VIOLATIONS, AND YET, THE

01:46.967 --> 01:48.633
REPUBLICANS PRIMARILY USED THEIR

01:48.700 --> 01:50.133
TIME TO ATTACK COHEN'S

01:50.200 --> 01:51.367
CREDIBILITY, NOT THAT HE WENT

01:51.433 --> 01:52.800
OUT OF THE WAY TO DISPUTE THAT

01:52.867 --> 01:55.100
CHARACTERIZATION.

01:55.166 --> 01:56.567
>> MR. COHEN, YOU CALLED

01:56.633 --> 01:58.100
DONALD TRUMP A CHEAT IN YOUR

01:58.166 --> 02:00.200
OPENING TESTIMONY.

02:00.266 --> 02:03.066
WHAT WOULD YOU CALL YOURSELF?

02:03.133 --> 02:05.033
>> A FOOL.

02:05.100 --> 02:07.033
>> YOU CALLING -- OKAY.

02:07.100 --> 02:08.400
WELL...

02:08.467 --> 02:10.233
>> John: YEAH, OKAY.

02:10.300 --> 02:11.400
I MEAN, IT IS PRETTY HARD TO

02:11.467 --> 02:13.233
ARGUE WITH THAT NOW, ISN'T IT?

02:13.300 --> 02:15.166
THE FACT THAT MICHAEL COHEN NOW

02:15.233 --> 02:16.166
HAS ABSOLUTELY NO RESPECT FOR

02:16.233 --> 02:17.633
MICHAEL COHEN IS THE FIRST THING

02:17.700 --> 02:19.200
I'VE EVER RESPECTED ABOUT

02:19.266 --> 02:22.133
MICHAEL COHEN.

02:22.200 --> 02:26.400
BUT EVEN THAT HEARING DIDN'T

02:26.467 --> 02:27.433
LAST LONG IN THE HEADLINES

02:27.500 --> 02:28.266
THANKS TO TRUMP'S THIRD FIASCO

02:28.333 --> 02:28.967
OF THE WEEK, WHICH CENTERED

02:29.033 --> 02:29.900
AROUND JARED KUSHNER, WHO'LL BE

02:29.967 --> 02:30.700
REFERRED TO AS "DIMINUTIVE

02:30.767 --> 02:31.867
NOTHING BOY 1" IN THE MUELLER

02:31.934 --> 02:32.767
REPORT.

02:32.834 --> 02:33.867
JARED IS CURRENTLY RIGHT WHERE

02:33.934 --> 02:34.867
YOU'D EXPECT A BOY HIS AGE TO

02:34.934 --> 02:36.133
BE: TRYING TO BROKER A PEACE

02:36.200 --> 02:37.567
DEAL IN ONE OF THE MOST

02:37.633 --> 02:38.600
INTRACTABLE CONFLICTS IN RECENT

02:38.667 --> 02:40.200
GEOPOLITICAL HISTORY.

02:40.266 --> 02:41.300
JARED HAS BEEN PROMISING AN

02:41.367 --> 02:42.533
ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN PEACE DEAL

02:42.600 --> 02:44.333
FOR TWO YEARS NOW AND RECENTLY

02:44.400 --> 02:46.166
PROMISED TO UNVEIL IT "SOMETIME

02:46.233 --> 02:48.166
AFTER THE ISRAELI ELECTIONS,"

02:48.233 --> 02:50.066
WHICH, AS FAR AS PROMISES GO,

02:50.133 --> 02:52.000
ISN'T ONE.

02:52.066 --> 02:53.500
ALTHOUGH HE ACTUALLY GOT CLOSE

02:53.567 --> 02:55.967
TO ALMOST DISCUSSING HIS PLAN

02:56.033 --> 02:56.567
THIS WEEK IN A RARE ON-CAMERA

02:56.633 --> 02:58.834
INTERVIEW WITH SKY NEWS ARABIA.

02:58.900 --> 03:00.567
>> WHAT WE HAVE FOUND IS THAT

03:00.633 --> 03:01.934
ALL THE CONFLICT DOES IS KEEP

03:02.000 --> 03:03.734
THE PEOPLE FROM HAVING THE

03:03.800 --> 03:04.800
OPPORTUNITY TO DO COMMERCE AND

03:04.867 --> 03:08.367
IMPROVE THEIR LIVES.

03:08.433 --> 03:09.533
>> John: I DON'T KNOW WHEN THAT

03:09.600 --> 03:11.500
JOKE IS GOING TO STOP BEING

03:11.567 --> 03:12.800
FUNNY, BUT IT'S NOT FUCKING NOW,

03:12.867 --> 03:14.300
AND IT PROBABLY WON'T BE THE

03:14.367 --> 03:16.066
NEXT TIME.

03:16.133 --> 03:17.400
BUT JARED'S SIX-NATION TOUR FOR

03:17.467 --> 03:18.934
PEACE WAS COMPLICATED BY A NEW

03:19.033 --> 03:20.867
REVELATION.

03:20.934 --> 03:21.934
>> "THE NEW YORK TIMES" REPORTS

03:22.000 --> 03:23.400
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP ORDERED HIS

03:23.467 --> 03:24.633
THEN-WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF

03:24.700 --> 03:27.500
JOHN KELLY TO GIVE A TOP-SECRET

03:27.567 --> 03:28.567
SECURITY CLEARANCE TO

03:28.633 --> 03:29.400
JARED KUSHNER.

03:29.467 --> 03:30.233
THE PAPER SAYS BOTH KELLY AND

03:30.300 --> 03:31.266
DON McGAHN, THE WHITE HOUSE

03:31.333 --> 03:32.500
COUNSEL AT THE TIME, WROTE MEMOS

03:32.567 --> 03:33.600
RAISING CONCERNS ABOUT THE

03:33.667 --> 03:35.066
ORDER.

03:35.133 --> 03:36.533
>> John: HONESTLY, THE ONLY

03:36.600 --> 03:38.467
SURPRISING THING THERE IS THE

03:38.533 --> 03:39.133
CLAIM THAT KELLY AND McGAHN

03:39.200 --> 03:40.166
BOTHERED TO WRITE MEMOS RAISING

03:40.233 --> 03:41.633
CONCERNS.

03:41.700 --> 03:43.166
THE FUCK IS TRUMP SUPPOSED TO DO

03:43.233 --> 03:45.100
WITH A MEMO RAISING CONCERNS?

03:45.166 --> 03:46.100
READ IT?

03:46.166 --> 03:46.734
A MEMO?

03:46.800 --> 03:47.533
WITH WHAT?

03:47.600 --> 03:49.734
HIS EYES?

03:49.800 --> 03:50.266
FOR WHAT POSSIBLE REASON?

03:50.333 --> 03:50.900
SO HE CAN KNOW STUFF?

03:50.967 --> 03:51.934
TO WHAT END?

03:52.000 --> 03:53.100
SO HE CAN DO STUFF?

03:53.166 --> 03:54.000
WHY?

03:54.066 --> 03:55.567
SO HE CAN GET MORE MEMOS ABOUT

03:55.633 --> 03:56.700
THE STUFF HE'S DOING?

03:56.767 --> 03:58.000
NICE TRY, MEMOS.

03:58.066 --> 04:00.066
YOU HAVE TO WAKE UP PRETTY EARLY

04:00.133 --> 04:01.767
IN THE MORNING TO PULL ONE OVER

04:01.834 --> 04:03.533
ON THIS GUY.

04:03.600 --> 04:06.900
MEMOS.

04:06.967 --> 04:08.500
NOW, ONE MAJOR ISSUE WITH JARED

04:08.567 --> 04:10.133
HAVING ACCESS TO STATE SECRETS

04:10.200 --> 04:12.867
IS, YOU KNOW, IT'S JARED.

04:12.934 --> 04:15.266
A GUY WHO, EVEN AMONG JAREDS,

04:15.333 --> 04:15.900
STANDS OUT AS THE JARED OF THE

04:15.967 --> 04:18.100
GROUP.

04:18.166 --> 04:19.600
BUT THE OTHER MAJOR ISSUE WITH

04:19.667 --> 04:20.734
HIS TOP-SECRET CLEARANCE

04:20.800 --> 04:23.033
CONCERNS NATIONAL SECURITY.

04:23.100 --> 04:24.233
>> A REPORT IN

04:24.300 --> 04:25.967
"THE WASHINGTON POST" SUGGESTS

04:26.066 --> 04:26.867
OFFICIALS FROM CHINA, ISRAEL,

04:26.934 --> 04:28.100
MEXICO, AND THE UNITED ARAB

04:28.166 --> 04:29.800
EMIRATES SAW KUSHNER AS

04:29.867 --> 04:31.767
EXPLOITABLE AND AT ONE POINT

04:31.834 --> 04:33.433
HOPED TO MANIPULATE HIM.

04:33.500 --> 04:35.166
>> John: WELL, HOLD ON.

04:35.233 --> 04:36.066
MANIPULATE HIM?

04:36.133 --> 04:36.834
JARED?

04:36.900 --> 04:38.100
THIS GUY?

04:38.166 --> 04:40.300
HE'D SNIFF THAT OUT IN A

04:40.367 --> 04:41.500
HEARTBEAT!

04:41.567 --> 04:42.934
UNLESS, OF, COURSE, SOMEONE GOT

04:43.000 --> 04:43.967
HIS NOSE!

04:44.033 --> 04:45.266
UH-OH!

04:45.333 --> 04:46.633
HOW'S JARED GOING TO GET HIS

04:46.700 --> 04:47.867
NOSE BACK?

04:47.934 --> 04:49.000
MAYBE TRADE IT FOR

04:49.066 --> 04:50.500
COMMUNICATIONS OF A FOREIGN

04:50.567 --> 04:51.233
GOVERNMENT EXTRALEGALLY

04:51.300 --> 04:52.467
INTERCEPTED BY U.S. MILITARY

04:52.533 --> 04:56.567
INTELLIGENCE?

04:56.633 --> 05:00.600
HOW ABOUT THAT?

05:00.667 --> 05:01.333
HOW ABOUT THAT, JARED?

05:01.400 --> 05:02.066
OKAY, THEN, THAT'S A DEAL.

05:02.133 --> 05:02.867
NOW WHO'S READY TO DETECT THE

05:02.934 --> 05:03.700
SLIGHTEST WHIFF OF MANIPULATION?

05:03.767 --> 05:04.667
WHO'S A GOOD BOY?

05:04.734 --> 05:05.367
BUT I'D ARGUE THERE ARE SOME

05:05.433 --> 05:06.166
VERY GOOD REASONS NOT TO GIVE

05:06.233 --> 05:07.567
JARED SECURITY CLEARANCE

05:07.633 --> 05:08.433
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER HE'S

05:08.500 --> 05:10.066
EASILY TRICKED, WHICH HE

05:10.100 --> 05:11.600
ABSOLUTELY IS, BECAUSE IF HE

05:11.667 --> 05:12.900
WEREN'T, I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN

05:12.967 --> 05:15.633
ABLE TO GET HIS NOSE AGAIN!

05:15.700 --> 05:16.633
OH, WHAT AM I GOING TO DO WITH

05:16.700 --> 05:18.166
TWO NOSES?

05:18.233 --> 05:19.967
OH, WELL!

05:20.033 --> 05:22.834
BECAUSE JARED INITIALLY FAILED

05:22.900 --> 05:24.367
TO DISCLOSE MEETINGS WITH

05:24.433 --> 05:26.133
RUSSIAN AGENTS TO THE FBI AND

05:26.200 --> 05:27.266
THERE'VE BEEN CONCERNS OVER HIS

05:27.333 --> 05:28.200
DEALINGS WITH FOREIGN

05:28.266 --> 05:29.667
BUSINESSMEN AND OFFICIALS.

05:29.734 --> 05:30.700
AND THAT'S NOT EVEN GETTING INTO

05:30.767 --> 05:32.300
MY BIGGEST CONCERN, WHICH IS HIS

05:32.367 --> 05:33.667
COMPLEXION.

05:33.734 --> 05:34.767
THAT ALONE SHOULD BE INSTANTLY

05:34.834 --> 05:36.567
DISQUALIFYING.

05:36.633 --> 05:38.433
HOW THE FUCK DOES HE LOOK SO

05:38.500 --> 05:40.266
WELL RESTED?

05:40.333 --> 05:41.467
THIS IS A GUY WHO'S NOT JUST

05:41.533 --> 05:42.667
BROKERING PEACE IN THE

05:42.734 --> 05:44.433
MIDDLE EAST, HE'S TACKLING THE

05:44.500 --> 05:46.066
OPIOID CRISIS AND NATIONAL

05:46.133 --> 05:47.100
INFRASTRUCTURE AS HEAD OF THE

05:47.166 --> 05:49.500
OFFICE OF AMERICAN INNOVATION,

05:49.567 --> 05:50.800
WHILE CONSTANTLY TRAVELING

05:50.867 --> 05:52.166
HALFWAY AROUND THE WORLD AND

05:52.233 --> 05:54.000
DOING IT ALL WHILE NAVIGATING

05:54.066 --> 05:55.433
THE PSYCHOSEXUAL STALINGRAD THAT

05:55.500 --> 05:56.533
IS MARRIAGE TO DONALD TRUMP'S

05:56.600 --> 05:58.600
DAUGHTER.

05:58.667 --> 05:59.533
WHERE ARE THE BAGS UNDER HIS

05:59.600 --> 06:00.867
EYES?

06:00.934 --> 06:03.100
HOW IS HIS SKIN SO SMOOTH?

06:03.166 --> 06:04.600
IT IS DEEPLY WORRISOME HOW

06:04.667 --> 06:07.100
UNWORRIED HE LOOKS.

06:07.166 --> 06:08.166
THE ONLY WAY YOU MAINTAIN THAT

06:08.233 --> 06:09.567
GLOW WITH THAT TO-DO LIST IS BY

06:09.633 --> 06:11.800
NOT REALLY UNDERSTANDING

06:11.867 --> 06:13.867
ANYTHING ON IT.

06:13.934 --> 06:15.400
I MEAN, JUST LOOK AT THIS.

06:15.467 --> 06:16.834
HE'S RADIANT IN EVERY SINGLE

06:16.900 --> 06:19.867
PHOTOGRAPH.

06:19.934 --> 06:23.400
HE HAS RESTING RESTED FACE.

06:23.467 --> 06:24.500
DO YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE GUY

06:24.567 --> 06:26.100
WHO HELPED BROKER THE 1993 OSLO

06:26.166 --> 06:27.233
PEACE ACCORDS LOOKED LIKE?

06:27.300 --> 06:28.467
THAT'S A RHETORICAL QUESTION,

06:28.533 --> 06:30.000
BECAUSE YOU ABSOLUTELY DON'T.

06:30.066 --> 06:31.100
THIS IS FORMER SECRETARY OF

06:31.166 --> 06:33.633
STATE WARREN CHRISTOPHER.

06:33.700 --> 06:35.667
THOSE ARE THE JOWLS OF A DEEPLY

06:35.734 --> 06:38.133
STRESSED-OUT INDIVIDUAL, STRESS

06:38.200 --> 06:39.400
THAT IS ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE

06:39.467 --> 06:40.266
GIVEN THE GRAVITY AND COMPLEXITY

06:40.333 --> 06:42.133
OF HIS WORKLOAD.

06:42.166 --> 06:44.600
JARED, ON THE OTHER HAND, LOOKS

06:44.667 --> 06:46.433
LIKE A 17TH CENTURY PORTRAIT OF

06:46.500 --> 06:48.700
A DUTCH TEENAGER.

06:48.767 --> 06:50.300
LOOK, SAY WHAT YOU WILL ABOUT

06:50.367 --> 06:51.233
HENRY KISSINGER -- AND THE

06:51.300 --> 06:52.333
CAMBODIAN CIVILIANS WHOSE

06:52.400 --> 06:53.734
VILLAGES HE BOMBED CERTAINLY

06:53.800 --> 06:55.333
CAN'T -- BUT THE MAN LOOKS

06:55.400 --> 06:56.867
REASSURINGLY TERRIBLE.

06:56.934 --> 06:58.333
AND YET HE'S THE EXACT SAME AGE

06:58.400 --> 07:02.367
AS JARED IN THAT PHOTO.

07:02.433 --> 07:03.667
AND THERE IS ONE MORE REASON

07:03.734 --> 07:04.867
THIS STORY COULD BE TROUBLE FOR

07:04.934 --> 07:09.300
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION:

07:09.367 --> 07:10.100
THEY HAVE REPEATEDLY DENIED, ON

07:10.166 --> 07:11.033
THE RECORD, THAT JARED GOT

07:11.100 --> 07:11.934
SPECIAL TREATMENT.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.066
IN JANUARY, WHEN TRUMP WAS ASKED

07:13.133 --> 07:13.734
WHETHER HE'D PUSHED JARED'S

07:13.800 --> 07:14.500
CLEARANCE THROUGH, HE SAID, "I

07:14.567 --> 07:15.533
WOULDN'T DO IT.

07:15.600 --> 07:16.467
I WAS NEVER INVOLVED WITH THE

07:16.533 --> 07:17.734
SECURITY."

07:17.800 --> 07:18.900
AND LAST MONTH, THIS WAS HOW

07:18.967 --> 07:20.667
IVANKA RESPONDED TO QUESTIONS.

07:20.734 --> 07:22.367
>> THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE

07:22.433 --> 07:23.533
THAT QUESTION WHETHER YOU WERE

07:23.600 --> 07:24.500
GIVEN SPECIAL TREATMENT BY THE

07:24.567 --> 07:25.433
PRESIDENT, OVERRIDING OTHER --

07:25.500 --> 07:26.800
>> ABSOLUTELY NOT.

07:26.867 --> 07:27.667
>> OFFICIALS.

07:27.734 --> 07:29.233
CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT?

07:29.300 --> 07:30.700
>> THERE WERE ANONYMOUS LEAKS

07:30.767 --> 07:33.867
ABOUT THERE BEING ISSUES.

07:33.934 --> 07:35.934
BUT THE PRESIDENT HAD NO

07:36.000 --> 07:37.166
INVOLVEMENT PERTAINING TO MY

07:37.233 --> 07:38.500
CLEARANCE OR MY HUSBAND'S

07:38.567 --> 07:39.767
CLEARANCE, ZERO.

07:39.834 --> 07:40.600
>> WHAT WERE THE PROBLEMS EARLY

07:40.667 --> 07:41.633
ON?

07:41.700 --> 07:42.934
>> THERE WEREN'T ANY.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.333
>> John: OH, PLEASE.

07:44.400 --> 07:45.300
I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW WHAT'S

07:45.367 --> 07:46.467
SADDER THERE.

07:46.533 --> 07:48.233
EITHER IVANKA'S KNOWINGLY LYING

07:48.300 --> 07:49.633
ABOUT HER DAD FORCING HER AND

07:49.700 --> 07:50.633
JARED'S SECURITY CLEARANCE

07:50.700 --> 07:52.500
THROUGH OR SHE GENUINELY THINKS

07:52.567 --> 07:54.200
THEY GOT IT ON MERIT ON THEIR

07:54.266 --> 07:59.500
OWN.

07:59.567 --> 08:00.266
AND IF IT IS THE LATTER, IVANKA,

08:00.333 --> 08:00.934
THERE ARE SOME THINGS YOU REALLY

08:01.000 --> 08:01.800
SHOULD KNOW.

08:01.867 --> 08:02.500
YOU ONLY BECAME AN EXECUTIVE

08:02.567 --> 08:03.467
VICE PRESIDENT OF THE TRUMP

08:03.533 --> 08:04.000
ORGANIZATION AT 24 BECAUSE

08:04.066 --> 08:04.734
YOU'RE DONALD TRUMP'S DAUGHTER,

08:04.800 --> 08:05.834
NOT BECAUSE YOU WERE A

08:05.900 --> 08:06.633
24-YEAR-OLD BUSINESS PRODIGY.

08:06.700 --> 08:07.734
YOU ONLY GOT A BOOK DEAL BECAUSE

08:07.800 --> 08:08.834
YOU'RE DONALD TRUMP'S DAUGHTER,

08:08.900 --> 08:10.633
NOT BECAUSE YOU'RE A BRILLIANT

08:10.700 --> 08:11.967
AUTHOR AND WORDSMITH.

08:12.033 --> 08:13.834
AND YOU ONLY HOSTED THE

08:13.900 --> 08:14.700
MISS TEEN USA PAGEANT BECAUSE

08:14.767 --> 08:16.400
YOUR DAD OWNED THE CONTEST, NOT

08:16.467 --> 08:17.734
BECAUSE OF YOUR SPARKLING

08:17.800 --> 08:20.033
ON-CAMERA PRESENCE.

08:20.100 --> 08:21.066
OH, AND YOU KNOW HOW SANTA CLAUS

08:21.133 --> 08:22.633
USED TO VISIT EVERY CHRISTMAS

08:22.700 --> 08:23.934
MORNING TO GIVE YOU PRESENTS?

08:24.000 --> 08:24.967
WELL, THAT WASN'T THE REAL

08:25.033 --> 08:25.834
SANTA.

08:25.900 --> 08:26.934
IT WAS MICHAEL COHEN.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.467
AND TRUST ME, HE WON'T BE COMING

08:28.533 --> 08:29.734
DOWN YOUR CHIMNEY ANYMORE.

08:29.800 --> 08:33.934
AND NOW THIS.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.433
>> Announcer: AND NOW, NO ONE

08:35.500 --> 08:37.633
DOES LOCAL NEWS BEAT POETRY

08:37.700 --> 08:39.600
QUITE LIKE NBC4 WASHINGTON'S

08:39.667 --> 08:42.100
PAT COLLINS.

08:42.166 --> 08:43.367
>> FIVE BURGLARIES HERE IN

08:43.433 --> 08:45.233
SIX DAYS.

08:45.300 --> 08:46.667
TWO ON THIS STREET.

08:46.734 --> 08:49.533
TWO ON THAT STREET.

08:49.600 --> 08:51.166
ONE ON A STREET DOWN AROUND THE

08:51.233 --> 08:52.500
CORNER.

08:52.567 --> 08:54.066
GLASS DOORS BROKEN.

08:54.133 --> 08:55.500
VALUABLES TAKEN.

08:55.567 --> 08:58.900
CREDIT CARDS, JEWELRY, CASH.

08:58.967 --> 09:00.934
WHEN VERIZON SHIPPED SOME

09:01.000 --> 09:03.066
CELL PHONES TO SOME STORES IN

09:03.133 --> 09:04.500
OUR AREA, THEY SHIPPED THE

09:04.567 --> 09:05.834
PHONES, BUT THE PHONES NEVER

09:05.900 --> 09:07.333
ARRIVED.

09:07.400 --> 09:09.467
COPS.

09:09.533 --> 09:12.033
COPS WANT THIS GUY REALLY BAD.

09:12.100 --> 09:14.333
YOU SEE, HE'S BEEN USING CVS

09:14.400 --> 09:18.367
STORES AS HIS OWN PERSONAL ATM.

09:18.433 --> 09:20.100
DOWNED POWER LINES.

09:20.166 --> 09:22.300
DOWNED TREES.

09:22.367 --> 09:24.400
NO WAY OUT OF HERE.

09:24.467 --> 09:25.934
TIM-BER.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.567
YIKES.

09:27.633 --> 09:29.000
MOTORCYCLE.

09:29.066 --> 09:30.433
MOTORCYCLE.

09:30.500 --> 09:32.300
MOTORCYCLE.

09:32.367 --> 09:34.200
SHE HAD A LOT OF MONEY.

09:34.266 --> 09:37.066
SHE HAD A PASSPORT.

09:37.133 --> 09:40.533
AND SHE HAD ONE OF THESE.

09:40.600 --> 09:41.867
SOME OF THE PHONES HAD BEEN

09:41.934 --> 09:43.767
ACTIVATED.

09:43.834 --> 09:46.433
SOME OF THE PHONES WERE IN USE.

09:46.500 --> 09:48.967
SOMETHING FISHY HERE.

09:49.033 --> 09:50.867
THEY SEEMED LIKE THEY KNEW WHAT

09:50.934 --> 09:54.200
THEY WERE DOING UNTIL THEY LEFT

09:54.266 --> 10:00.433
AND HAD THAT KODAK MOMENT.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.700
>> John: MOVING ON.

10:03.767 --> 10:04.734
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

10:04.800 --> 10:06.600
JOBS.

10:06.667 --> 10:07.500
YOU KNOW, THE THING EVERY KID

10:07.567 --> 10:09.100
GETS ASKED ABOUT.

10:09.166 --> 10:09.834
>> WHAT DO YOU WANT TO BE WHEN

10:09.900 --> 10:13.800
YOU GROW UP?

10:13.867 --> 10:14.633
>> I WANT TO BE --

10:14.700 --> 10:15.200
HEY.

10:15.266 --> 10:16.500
I NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT.

10:16.567 --> 10:17.133
>> I WANT TO BE A LAWYER.

10:17.200 --> 10:17.700
>> LAWYER.

10:17.767 --> 10:18.367
>> PILOT.

10:18.433 --> 10:18.934
>> PILOT.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.166
>> A PILOT.

10:20.233 --> 10:21.800
AND A DAD.

10:21.867 --> 10:23.800
A PILOT RACER DAD.

10:23.867 --> 10:26.000
>> I WANT TO BE AN ARTIST THAT

10:26.066 --> 10:27.767
GOES AROUND PAINTING WALLS.

10:27.867 --> 10:28.600
>> I WANT TO BE A DOCTOR.

10:28.667 --> 10:29.033
>> DOCTOR.

10:29.100 --> 10:29.767
>> DOCTOR.

10:29.834 --> 10:30.767
>> A MERMAID.

10:30.834 --> 10:34.433
>> A MERMAID DOCTOR.

10:34.500 --> 10:35.333
>> John: OOH, A MERMAID DOCTOR?

10:35.400 --> 10:37.200
I MEAN, SURE, EVERYONE WANTS TO

10:37.266 --> 10:38.567
BE A MERMAID DOCTOR, UNTIL, THAT

10:38.633 --> 10:39.900
IS, YOU HAVE TO DO YOUR FIRST

10:39.967 --> 10:41.333
MERMAID COLONOSCOPY.

10:41.400 --> 10:43.033
TWO THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT

10:43.100 --> 10:45.567
A MERMAID'S ASSHOLE, KID, AND

10:45.633 --> 10:46.467
YOU MAY AS WELL LEARN THEM

10:46.533 --> 10:47.333
NOW: ONE, NO MATTER WHERE YOU'RE

10:47.400 --> 10:48.133
PICTURING IT, THAT'S NOT WHERE

10:48.200 --> 10:49.166
IT IS.

10:49.233 --> 10:50.233
AND TWO, NO ONE COMES OUT THE

10:50.300 --> 10:51.400
SAME PERSON THEY WENT IN.

10:51.467 --> 10:52.500
A PART OF YOU DIES IN THERE, AND

10:52.567 --> 10:53.967
YOU'LL SPEND THE REST OF YOUR

10:54.033 --> 10:55.834
LIFE TRYING TO GET IT BACK.

10:55.900 --> 10:58.000
ANYWAY, JOBS WERE A MAJOR THEME

10:58.066 --> 10:59.467
IN DONALD TRUMP'S PRESIDENTIAL

10:59.533 --> 11:01.066
CAMPAIGN, ALONG WITH --

11:01.133 --> 11:02.967
OF COURSE -- WALLS, TACO BOWLS,

11:03.033 --> 11:04.734
ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT,

11:04.800 --> 11:05.900
AND ADMISSIONS OF

11:05.967 --> 11:07.467
SEXUAL ASSAULT.

11:07.533 --> 11:09.133
BUT TRUMP'S PRIMARY FOCUS AS

11:09.200 --> 11:10.734
CANDIDATE AND PRESIDENT HAS BEEN

11:10.800 --> 11:12.233
ON JOBS -- SPECIFICALLY, WHO WAS

11:12.333 --> 11:14.934
STEALING THEM.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.633
>> WHETHER IT'S CHINA OR JAPAN

11:16.700 --> 11:17.600
OR MEXICO, THEY'RE ALL TAKING

11:17.667 --> 11:20.100
OUR JOBS.

11:20.166 --> 11:20.734
NOW VIETNAM, THAT'S THE NEW ONE.

11:20.800 --> 11:21.767
THEY ARE TAKING OUR JOBS.

11:21.834 --> 11:22.834
THE JOBS ARE BEING TAKEN BY

11:22.900 --> 11:24.600
INDIA.

11:24.667 --> 11:26.734
OUR JOBS WERE STOLEN AWAY AND

11:26.800 --> 11:28.567
SHIPPED FAR AWAY TO OTHER

11:28.633 --> 11:30.333
COUNTRIES, SOME OF WHICH YOU'VE

11:30.400 --> 11:32.467
NEVER EVEN HEARD OF.

11:32.533 --> 11:34.367
>> John: YES, OUR JOBS ARE BEING

11:34.433 --> 11:35.667
STOLEN BY COUNTRIES YOU HAVE

11:35.734 --> 11:38.867
NEVER EVEN HEARD OF.

11:38.934 --> 11:39.834
ALTHOUGH, TRY AND REMEMBER, THIS

11:39.900 --> 11:40.667
IS COMING FROM THE MAN WHO

11:40.734 --> 11:42.367
REPORTEDLY REFERRED TO NEPAL AND

11:42.433 --> 11:44.066
BHUTAN AS "NIPPLE" AND "BUTTON,"

11:44.133 --> 11:46.066
SO FOR TRUMP, "COUNTRIES YOU'VE

11:46.133 --> 11:48.400
NEVER HEARD OF" COULD JUST MEAN

11:48.467 --> 11:50.567
BULGY AREOLA, BARB'S ANUS,

11:50.633 --> 11:52.233
BORING, URETHRA, HONDA RICE,

11:52.300 --> 11:55.133
ANKLE, FAT HAMSTER, FENCE,

11:55.200 --> 11:57.700
JEREMY, BIKINI FATSO, LE SOFA,

11:57.767 --> 11:59.967
BALLS-IN-YA AND HATER-VAGINA,

12:00.033 --> 12:02.367
GAY WATER, BUTT SWALLOW,

12:02.433 --> 12:04.767
LICKING TIME, POCAHONTA,

12:04.834 --> 12:05.667
LORKS AND BLORSH,

12:05.734 --> 12:07.200
HOT GIRL WITH JIZZ IN HER HAIR,

12:07.266 --> 12:10.300
"MY WIFE," MY TACO, GRENADE,

12:10.367 --> 12:11.767
THE ONE THAT SOUNDS LIKE A BUTT,

12:11.834 --> 12:13.633
BAD ASIA, SLIM SHADY,

12:13.700 --> 12:15.967
QUESO BOWL, FUCK THAT,

12:16.033 --> 12:18.100
DADDY FAT HAMSTER, LICE,

12:18.166 --> 12:21.600
LESBIAN, RUSSIA, MACARENA,

12:21.667 --> 12:23.734
VAG LANDS, POO LAND,

12:23.800 --> 12:25.834
PAMELA, MARINARA, SEAGULL,

12:25.900 --> 12:28.500
PILLOW, RUSSIA, JARED'S FRIENDS,

12:28.567 --> 12:30.867
SANTA KIDS AND NORBIT,

12:30.934 --> 12:32.233
MORE TITTIES, GUITAR,

12:32.300 --> 12:34.367
PAIR OF GAYS, SAMOSAS, TOGA,

12:34.433 --> 12:35.633
TO-GO, FEELING PEENS,

12:35.700 --> 12:36.900
THE MEDIUM GROSS LETTUCE,

12:36.967 --> 12:39.600
YOU'RE A GAY, ZOOMBA, XANADU,

12:39.667 --> 12:42.100
MAGNOLIA, AND HOTEL FOR DOGS,

12:42.200 --> 12:42.700
NO, WAIT, THE OTHER ONE,

12:42.767 --> 12:43.700
THE ONE THAT'S NOT FOR DOGS,

12:43.767 --> 12:44.767
HOTEL THAT ONE.

12:44.834 --> 12:47.333
BASICALLY, TRUMP'S PHILOSOPHY

12:47.400 --> 12:49.100
IS, "THE WORLD: NEVER HEARD OF

12:49.166 --> 12:50.100
IT, BUT IT'S STEALING YOUR

12:50.166 --> 12:52.567
JOBS."

12:52.633 --> 12:54.533
AND LOOK, SOME MANUFACTURING

12:54.600 --> 12:56.000
JOBS ARE GONE BECAUSE THEY WENT

12:56.066 --> 12:58.066
OVERSEAS, BUT TRUMP IS

12:58.133 --> 13:00.066
COMPLETELY IGNORING ANOTHER

13:00.133 --> 13:01.433
MAJOR FACTOR BEHIND JOB LOSSES:

13:01.500 --> 13:03.367
AUTOMATION.

13:03.433 --> 13:04.867
ITS IMPACT HAS BEEN MASSIVE.

13:04.934 --> 13:06.133
YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IT FROM HOW

13:06.200 --> 13:07.233
TRUMP TALKS, BUT OUR

13:07.300 --> 13:08.900
MANUFACTURING SECTOR NOW

13:08.967 --> 13:10.734
PRODUCES TWICE AS MUCH AS IT DID

13:10.800 --> 13:12.867
IN 1984 BUT WE PRODUCE IT WITH

13:12.934 --> 13:15.033
ONE-THIRD FEWER WORKERS.

13:15.100 --> 13:17.266
THE POINT IS, MANY OF THOSE JOBS

13:17.333 --> 13:18.767
AREN'T BEING STOLEN -- THEY ARE

13:18.834 --> 13:20.367
DISAPPEARING BECAUSE MACHINES

13:20.433 --> 13:22.266
ARE NOW DOING THEM.

13:22.333 --> 13:23.834
AND THANKS TO ADVANCES IN AI AND

13:23.900 --> 13:24.700
ROBOTICS, THERE ARE CONCERNS

13:24.767 --> 13:26.400
THAT THIS SORT OF JOB LOSS COULD

13:26.467 --> 13:28.333
ACCELERATE.

13:28.400 --> 13:29.166
IN FACT, A FEW YEARS BACK, SOME

13:29.233 --> 13:30.033
PEOPLE GOT VERY CONCERNED WHEN

13:30.100 --> 13:31.200
AN OXFORD UNIVERSITY STUDY CAME

13:31.266 --> 13:34.266
OUT WITH A STARTLING NUMBER.

13:34.333 --> 13:35.166
>> AN OXFORD UNIVERSITY STUDY

13:35.233 --> 13:36.600
SAYS THAT UP TO HALF OF ALL JOBS

13:36.667 --> 13:37.667
IN THE U.S. ARE AT RISK TO

13:37.734 --> 13:40.433
AUTOMATION.

13:40.500 --> 13:41.967
>> A NEW STUDY WHICH SUGGESTS

13:42.033 --> 13:43.333
MANY OF US MAY LOSE OUR JOBS

13:43.400 --> 13:44.867
BECAUSE OF ROBOTS.

13:44.934 --> 13:46.333
>> A ROBOT IS PROBABLY GOING TO

13:46.400 --> 13:47.500
TAKE YOUR JOB.

13:47.567 --> 13:48.367
THAT'S ACCORDING TO A NEW OXFORD

13:48.433 --> 13:51.266
UNIVERSITY STUDY.

13:51.333 --> 13:52.333
>> THAT'S CLOSE TO 50% OF THE

13:52.400 --> 13:53.500
WORKFORCE BEING COMPLETELY

13:53.567 --> 13:54.867
ELIMINATED, AS IN NO MORE JOBS

13:54.934 --> 13:57.100
FOR THEM.

13:57.166 --> 13:58.667
>> John: WOW.

13:58.734 --> 13:59.967
50% OF ALL OUR JOBS WILL BE

14:00.033 --> 14:01.166
GONE.

14:01.233 --> 14:01.934
THAT IS TERRIFYING --

14:02.000 --> 14:02.900
FOR YOU.

14:02.967 --> 14:04.934
LUCKILY, A ROBOT COULD NEVER BE

14:05.000 --> 14:07.166
A LATE-NIGHT HOST.

14:07.233 --> 14:08.667
IT'D MAKE BASIC MISTAKES, LIKE,

14:08.734 --> 14:09.767
SAY, DEVOTING 90 SECONDS OF AIR

14:09.834 --> 14:11.467
TIME TO A LIST OF DUMB NAMES

14:11.533 --> 14:12.500
TRUMP MIGHT HAVE FOR OTHER

14:12.567 --> 14:14.133
COUNTRIES.

14:14.233 --> 14:16.367
HOW WEIRD WOULD THAT BE?

14:16.433 --> 14:17.166
IT'S CALLED PACING, ROBOTS.

14:17.233 --> 14:18.667
LOOK IT UP.

14:18.734 --> 14:19.867
YOU DON'T DO A MASSIVE LIST OF

14:19.934 --> 14:20.500
NAMES BEFORE YOU'VE INTRODUCED

14:20.567 --> 14:22.633
THE THESIS OF YOUR PIECE.

14:22.700 --> 14:25.367
ANYWAY, THE THESIS OF THIS PIECE

14:25.433 --> 14:27.200
IS THAT WHILE PEOPLE OFTEN TALK

14:27.266 --> 14:28.667
ABOUT AUTOMATION IN APOCALYPTIC

14:28.734 --> 14:30.500
TERMS, THE TRUTH IS, EVERYTHING

14:30.567 --> 14:32.834
ABOUT IT IS MORE COMPLICATED

14:32.900 --> 14:34.500
THAN YOU THINK, INCLUDING THAT

14:34.567 --> 14:36.033
"HALF YOUR JOBS WILL BE GONE"

14:36.100 --> 14:37.033
OXFORD STUDY.

14:37.100 --> 14:38.300
SO TONIGHT, LET'S TALK ABOUT

14:38.367 --> 14:39.433
AUTOMATION.

14:39.500 --> 14:40.400
AND LET'S BEGIN WITH THE FACT

14:40.467 --> 14:41.400
THAT, WHILE IT'S OFTEN PRESENTED

14:41.467 --> 14:42.967
AS A SCARY NEW PROBLEM, IT'S

14:43.033 --> 14:44.500
NEITHER ENTIRELY SCARY NOR

14:44.567 --> 14:46.166
ENTIRELY NEW.

14:46.233 --> 14:47.700
FROM THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION

14:47.767 --> 14:49.700
THROUGH THE RISE OF MASS

14:49.767 --> 14:51.033
PRODUCTION, AUTOMATION HAS

14:51.100 --> 14:52.467
TRANSFORMED OUR SOCIETY IN WAYS

14:52.533 --> 14:54.133
PEOPLE HAVE MARVELED AT,

14:54.200 --> 14:56.133
SOMETIMES IN LESS-THAN-IDEAL

14:56.200 --> 14:57.400
LANGUAGE.

14:57.467 --> 14:58.600
>> POWER AND THE HIGHLY

14:58.667 --> 14:59.667
IMPORTANT STANDARDIZATION OF

14:59.700 --> 15:01.633
PARTS AND MASS PRODUCTION WITH

15:01.700 --> 15:03.934
ITS ASSEMBLY LINES HAVE CREATED

15:04.000 --> 15:05.734
MORE MECHANICAL SLAVES FOR MAN.

15:05.800 --> 15:07.266
MECHANICAL SLAVES IN THE MACHINE

15:07.333 --> 15:11.533
TOOL INDUSTRY-CREATED BY MAN TO

15:11.600 --> 15:12.333
CREATE MORE MECHANICAL SLAVES.

15:12.400 --> 15:14.300
THE AVERAGE MAN IN THE

15:14.367 --> 15:16.066
UNITED STATES TODAY IS SAID TO

15:16.133 --> 15:17.300
HAVE AT HIS BECK AND CALL

15:17.367 --> 15:19.066
20 MECHANICAL SLAVES.

15:19.133 --> 15:21.867
>> John: "SLAVES, SLAVES,

15:21.934 --> 15:22.467
SLAVES!

15:22.533 --> 15:23.667
OH, HOW I HAVE MISSED THEM!

15:23.734 --> 15:24.834
YES, MECHANICAL SLAVES: IF YOU

15:24.900 --> 15:25.900
CLOSE YOUR EYES, YOU CAN FORGET

15:25.967 --> 15:32.967
THAT THEY'RE MECHANICAL."

15:33.033 --> 15:33.967
AND, LOOK, THERE IS NO DOUBT:

15:34.033 --> 15:34.700
MECHANICAL SLAVES -- OR

15:34.767 --> 15:35.800
"MACHINES" AS A NORMAL PERSON

15:35.867 --> 15:36.533
MIGHT DESCRIBE THEM -- HAVE HAD

15:36.600 --> 15:38.000
HUGELY BENEFICIAL EFFECTS.

15:38.066 --> 15:38.734
THEY'VE MADE GOODS CHEAPER AND

15:38.800 --> 15:40.100
JOBS EASIER AND SOMETIMES SAFER.

15:40.166 --> 15:41.934
TAKE THIS MAN.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.600
HE RUNS A LOGGING COMPANY, AND

15:43.667 --> 15:45.600
HE'S DEVELOPING MACHINES TO FELL

15:45.667 --> 15:47.000
TREES, WHICH WOULD PUT HIS OWN

15:47.066 --> 15:49.767
SON OUT OF A JOB.

15:49.834 --> 15:50.967
BUT HE'S DOING IT FOR A PRETTY

15:51.033 --> 15:52.900
COMPELLING REASON.

15:52.967 --> 15:54.633
>> IF YOU HAVE A MAN ON A

15:54.700 --> 15:56.000
CHAINSAW FALLING TREES, THEY'RE

15:56.066 --> 15:57.734
EVENTUALLY GOING TO GET HURT.

15:57.800 --> 15:59.000
>> LOGGING HAS THE HIGHEST DEATH

15:59.066 --> 16:00.000
RATE OF ANY AMERICAN OCCUPATION.

16:00.066 --> 16:01.567
FOR ITS SIZE, LOGGING KILLS

16:01.633 --> 16:03.133
PEOPLE AT A HIGHER RATE THAN THE

16:03.200 --> 16:04.533
MILITARY.

16:04.600 --> 16:06.367
>> I'VE COME TO THE BELIEF THAT

16:06.433 --> 16:08.200
THE ONLY WAY I CAN ENSURE THE

16:08.266 --> 16:09.567
SAFETY OF MY PEOPLE IS NOT HAVE

16:09.633 --> 16:10.734
THEM THERE.

16:10.800 --> 16:11.667
THE BEST WAY NOT TO KILL A

16:11.734 --> 16:14.467
HAND CUTTER IS NOT HAVE ONE.

16:14.533 --> 16:15.266
>> John: HE'S RIGHT.

16:15.333 --> 16:16.500
THE BEST WAY NOT TO KILL A

16:16.567 --> 16:18.100
HAND CUTTER IS NOT TO HAVE ONE,

16:18.166 --> 16:19.900
WHICH PRESUMABLY MEANS THE BEST

16:19.967 --> 16:22.100
WAY TO KILL A HAND CUTTER IS TO

16:22.166 --> 16:23.333
HAVE ONE.

16:23.400 --> 16:25.066
SO IF YOU'RE TRYING TO MURDER A

16:25.133 --> 16:26.500
LUMBERJACK, IT'S PROBABLY BEST

16:26.567 --> 16:28.233
JUST TO HIRE HIM AND WAIT.

16:28.300 --> 16:30.433
ALSO DON'T DO IT.

16:30.500 --> 16:32.600
DON'T DO IT.

16:32.667 --> 16:34.200
BUT IF YOU REALLY WANT TO, THAT

16:34.266 --> 16:34.767
WOULD BE HOW TO GO ABOUT IT.

16:34.834 --> 16:36.500
WHICH YOU SHOULDN'T.

16:36.567 --> 16:37.734
YOU ABSOLUTELY SHOULDN'T DESPITE

16:37.800 --> 16:39.000
THE FACT I'VE JUST GIVEN YOU A

16:39.066 --> 16:39.734
PERFECT BLUEPRINT FOR HOW TO GET

16:39.800 --> 16:41.166
AWAY WITH IT.

16:41.233 --> 16:42.200
BUT AGAIN, I WANT TO MAKE THIS

16:42.266 --> 16:43.367
ABSOLUTELY CLEAR: NOBODY OUT

16:43.433 --> 16:44.333
THERE SHOULD MURDER A

16:44.400 --> 16:46.166
LUMBERJACK.

16:46.233 --> 16:47.133
YOU SHOULD JUST WAIT FOR THEM TO

16:47.200 --> 16:49.200
DIE IN AN ACCIDENT.

16:49.266 --> 16:50.900
IT'S THE PERFECT CRIME.

16:50.967 --> 16:52.100
BUT THE TRUTH IS, FROM

16:52.166 --> 16:53.433
EMPLOYERS' POINT OF VIEW, THE

16:53.500 --> 16:55.066
BIG SELLING POINT FOR AUTOMATION

16:55.133 --> 16:56.200
IS THAT IT INCREASES

16:56.266 --> 16:57.433
PRODUCTIVITY AND IT MAXIMIZES

16:57.500 --> 16:59.333
PROFITS.

16:59.400 --> 17:00.567
AND FOR DISPLACED WORKERS, THAT

17:00.633 --> 17:01.967
HAS CAUSED IMMENSE PAIN

17:02.033 --> 17:03.200
THROUGHOUT HISTORY, AND NOT JUST

17:03.266 --> 17:04.767
IN FACTORIES.

17:04.834 --> 17:06.233
FOR INSTANCE, IN THE '90s, AS

17:06.300 --> 17:07.433
VOICE RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY

17:07.500 --> 17:08.567
IMPROVED, PHONE COMPANY

17:08.633 --> 17:09.867
OPERATORS WERE RIGHTLY WORRIED

17:09.934 --> 17:11.433
FOR THEIR JOBS.

17:11.500 --> 17:12.433
>> MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS, UH-OH.

17:12.500 --> 17:14.033
HERE COMES TROUBLE.

17:14.133 --> 17:15.533
THIS IS GONNA GET MY JOB FOR

17:15.600 --> 17:17.100
SURE.

17:17.166 --> 17:18.166
>> THE FIRST THING I THOUGHT

17:18.233 --> 17:19.333
ABOUT WAS THAT THIS IS GONNA BE

17:19.400 --> 17:20.066
A ROBOT, THEY'RE NOT GONNA NEED

17:20.133 --> 17:20.934
AS MANY OPERATORS, I'M ABOUT TO

17:21.000 --> 17:22.367
LOSE MY JOB.

17:22.433 --> 17:23.500
>> I TALKED TO SOME FRIENDS OF

17:23.567 --> 17:26.000
MINE BACK WHERE I CAME FROM IN

17:26.066 --> 17:27.066
SHREVEPORT IN THE OFFICE, AND

17:27.133 --> 17:28.000
THE RUMORS WERE RUNNING RAMPANT

17:28.066 --> 17:29.300
OVER THERE.

17:29.367 --> 17:30.500
YOU KNOW, LIKE, "OH, MY GOSH,

17:30.567 --> 17:31.467
THEY'RE TESTING THIS MACHINE,

17:31.533 --> 17:32.767
AND IT'S GONNA DO AWAY WITH OUR

17:32.834 --> 17:34.133
JOB, AND THEY'RE SHUTTING -- YOU

17:34.200 --> 17:35.834
KNOW, WE HEARD THEY WERE

17:35.900 --> 17:36.700
SHUTTING DOWN Y'ALL'S OFFICE AND

17:36.767 --> 17:41.367
GOING COMPLETELY TO MACHINES."

17:41.433 --> 17:42.667
>> John, OKAY, FIRST OF ALL, AND

17:42.734 --> 17:43.834
I KNOW THIS ISN'T THE POINT --

17:43.900 --> 17:44.400
WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON IN

17:44.467 --> 17:45.000
SHREVEPORT?

17:45.066 --> 17:46.033
LISA LEE HERE IS YOUR FRIEND AND

17:46.100 --> 17:47.967
YOU'RE ALL "HEY, LISA, YOU'RE

17:48.033 --> 17:53.133
GOING TO GET FIRED"?

17:53.200 --> 17:53.834
FUCK YOU, SHREVEPORT.

17:53.900 --> 17:54.600
GIRL, YOU DESERVE FRIENDS WHO

17:54.667 --> 17:55.367
LIFT YOU UP, NOT TEAR YOU DOWN.

17:55.433 --> 17:55.967
TAKE A STEP BACK AND REMEMBER

17:56.033 --> 17:56.533
HOW FAR YOU'VE COME.

17:56.600 --> 17:57.333
YOU DON'T NEED SHREVEPORT.

17:57.400 --> 17:58.300
SHREVEPORT NEEDS YOU.

17:58.367 --> 17:59.600
NOW YOU PICK YOURSELF UP AND YOU

17:59.667 --> 18:00.266
SHOW THE WORLD WHAT LISA LEE IS

18:00.333 --> 18:02.400
REALLY MADE OF.

18:02.467 --> 18:04.533
YOU GO, GIRL!

18:04.600 --> 18:08.834
YOU GO!

18:08.900 --> 18:10.800
BUT WHEN YOU SEE THIS THROUGH

18:10.867 --> 18:12.567
THE EYES OF WORRIED EMPLOYEES,

18:12.633 --> 18:14.767
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THE

18:14.834 --> 18:16.367
DEEP-SEATED HUMAN URGE THAT MANY

18:16.433 --> 18:18.500
OF US HAVE TO SEE ROBOTS COME TO

18:18.567 --> 18:20.200
HARM, WHETHER WE'RE JOYOUSLY

18:20.266 --> 18:21.467
RETWEETING THIS PHOTO,

18:21.533 --> 18:22.700
CAPTIONED, "OUR D.C. OFFICE

18:22.767 --> 18:24.166
BUILDING GOT A SECURITY ROBOT.

18:24.233 --> 18:25.567
IT DROWNED ITSELF."

18:25.633 --> 18:27.967
OR JUST ATTACKING ANY ROBOT

18:28.033 --> 18:30.900
FOOLISH ENOUGH TO TRUST US.

18:30.967 --> 18:32.367
>> THE IDEA WAS TO SEE HOW

18:32.433 --> 18:33.700
PEOPLE WOULD INTERACT WITH A

18:33.767 --> 18:35.967
TALKING SOLAR-POWERED ROBOT AS

18:36.033 --> 18:37.834
IT HITCHED ACROSS AMERICA ON ITS

18:37.900 --> 18:39.533
OWN TRACKED BY A GPS.

18:39.600 --> 18:40.667
ON SATURDAY, THE ROBOT WAS FOUND

18:40.734 --> 18:43.700
IN PHILADELPHIA, THE CITY OF

18:43.767 --> 18:45.734
BROTHERLY LOVE, RESTING IN

18:45.800 --> 18:48.200
PIECES.

18:48.266 --> 18:49.900
LATE TODAY, VIDEO SURFACED OF

18:49.967 --> 18:51.133
THE ATTACK, BUT THE ROBOT'S

18:51.200 --> 18:53.734
CREATORS ARE NOT OUT FOR

18:53.800 --> 18:54.700
REVENGE.

18:54.767 --> 18:55.533
>> I'M SURE IT COULD HAVE

18:55.600 --> 18:56.333
HAPPENED ANYWHERE.

18:56.400 --> 18:57.300
>> YEAH.

18:57.367 --> 18:58.734
>> AND WE DON'T REALLY THINK IT

18:58.800 --> 18:59.266
HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH

18:59.333 --> 19:00.300
PHILADELPHIA.

19:00.367 --> 19:01.100
>> John: YOU'RE WRONG ABOUT

19:01.166 --> 19:02.300
THAT.

19:02.367 --> 19:03.667
IT HAS ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING TO

19:03.734 --> 19:05.834
DO WITH PHILADELPHIA.

19:05.900 --> 19:06.934
THIS IS A CITY WITH A CHRONIC

19:07.000 --> 19:08.266
POLICE HORSE PUNCHING PROBLEM.

19:08.333 --> 19:10.200
SENDING A HITCHHIKING ROBOT INTO

19:10.266 --> 19:12.467
PHILADELPHIA IS NOT UNLIKE

19:12.533 --> 19:14.367
SENDING A BEAUTIFUL BELL

19:14.433 --> 19:15.200
SYMBOLIZING FREEDOM INTO

19:15.266 --> 19:16.367
PHILADELPHIA.

19:16.433 --> 19:17.533
THERE IS NO WAY IT'S GOING TO

19:17.600 --> 19:19.033
REMAIN IN ONE PIECE, AND THERE'S

19:19.100 --> 19:20.266
A NON-ZERO CHANCE THAT SOMEONE

19:20.333 --> 19:22.767
IS GOING TO TRY AND FUCK IT.

19:22.834 --> 19:28.333
SO, SO...

19:28.400 --> 19:30.600
AT THIS POINT, YOU MAY BE

19:30.667 --> 19:31.533
THINKING, "WELL, WHATEVER ITS

19:31.600 --> 19:32.767
ADVANTAGES, AUTOMATION THROWS A

19:32.834 --> 19:34.600
LOT OF PEOPLE OUT OF WORK,

19:34.667 --> 19:35.300
RIGHT?"

19:35.367 --> 19:36.734
WELL, YES, BUT AGAIN, IT IS

19:36.800 --> 19:38.567
COMPLICATED, AND THE PICTURE

19:38.633 --> 19:40.200
OFTEN GETS DISTORTED.

19:40.266 --> 19:41.200
REMEMBER THAT REPORT FROM

19:41.266 --> 19:41.967
EARLIER?

19:42.033 --> 19:42.767
THE ONE THAT LED TO CLAIMS THAT

19:42.834 --> 19:44.300
HALF OF OUR JOBS WERE GOING

19:44.367 --> 19:45.834
AWAY?

19:45.900 --> 19:46.867
THERE ARE REAL CONCERNS ABOUT

19:46.934 --> 19:47.967
ITS METHODOLOGY, AND OTHER

19:48.033 --> 19:49.233
STUDIES HAVE COME UP WITH MUCH

19:49.300 --> 19:50.867
LOWER NUMBERS.

19:50.934 --> 19:52.333
BUT EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY, IT

19:52.400 --> 19:54.300
DIDN'T CLAIM HALF OF JOBS WOULD

19:54.367 --> 19:55.300
BE GONE.

19:55.367 --> 19:56.367
IT SUGGESTED SOME JOBS WERE IN

19:56.433 --> 19:57.934
THE HIGH-RISK CATEGORY FOR BEING

19:58.000 --> 19:59.900
AUTOMATED, AND THAT IS ACTUALLY

19:59.967 --> 20:01.166
A VERY DIFFERENT THING, BECAUSE

20:01.233 --> 20:03.433
A JOB AUTOMATED IS NOT

20:03.500 --> 20:04.967
NECESSARILY A JOB LOST.

20:05.033 --> 20:06.467
FREQUENTLY, MACHINES DON'T

20:06.533 --> 20:07.967
REPLACE JOBS SO MUCH AS TASKS.

20:08.033 --> 20:09.433
A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THIS CONCERNS

20:09.500 --> 20:11.633
ATMs.

20:11.700 --> 20:12.867
IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE A TIME

20:12.934 --> 20:15.600
THEY WEREN'T AROUND, BUT WHEN

20:15.667 --> 20:18.800
THEY BECAME COMMON IN THE '80s,

20:18.867 --> 20:20.300
BANK TELLERS WERE AFRAID OF THEM

20:20.367 --> 20:21.400
STEALING THEIR JOBS.

20:21.467 --> 20:22.700
OF COURSE, CUSTOMERS WERE

20:22.767 --> 20:24.166
SOMETIMES AFRAID OF THEM FOR

20:24.233 --> 20:24.934
VERY DIFFERENT REASONS.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
>> DOES IT HURT?

20:26.066 --> 20:27.200
>> YEAH, IT HURTS.

20:27.266 --> 20:28.500
>> IGNORING THE OLD ADAGE "NEVER

20:28.567 --> 20:30.100
BITE THE HAND THAT FEEDS YOU,"

20:30.166 --> 20:31.433
THE BANK OF AMERICA VERSATELLER

20:31.500 --> 20:33.233
DID JUST THAT, SNAPPED ONTO

20:33.300 --> 20:42.700
PAUL'S HAND WHILE IT WAS TRYING

20:42.767 --> 20:43.400
TO TRANSACT BUSINESS WITH IT.

20:43.467 --> 20:44.333
>> I THOUGHT IF I REACH IN

20:44.400 --> 20:44.934
THERE, I CAN PULL ONE OF THOSE

20:45.000 --> 20:45.533
ENVELOPES OUT, GO AND MAKE A

20:45.600 --> 20:46.266
DEPOSIT, AND GO ON TO WORK.

20:46.333 --> 20:47.066
I'M TRYING TO GET TO WORK, YEAH.

20:47.133 --> 20:48.233
>> John: THAT MAN DIED.

20:48.300 --> 20:48.834
NOT OF THAT.

20:48.900 --> 20:49.367
NOT OF THAT.

20:49.433 --> 20:50.000
NOT OF THAT.

20:50.066 --> 20:50.600
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

20:50.667 --> 20:51.767
NO, HE DIED TWO YEARS LATER,

20:51.834 --> 20:52.667
WHEN HE GOT STUCK INSIDE A CLAW

20:52.734 --> 20:53.166
MACHINE.

20:53.233 --> 20:53.967
THAT'S A FACT.

20:54.033 --> 20:57.767
THAT'S A FACT.

20:57.834 --> 20:58.533
WHAT'S IS THAT FACT BASED ON?

20:58.600 --> 20:59.667
NOTHING OTHER THAN MY TOTAL

20:59.734 --> 21:00.767
CONVICTION THAT IT'S TRUE.

21:00.834 --> 21:01.967
BUT WHILE ATMs DID EAT THE

21:02.066 --> 21:02.800
OCCASIONAL CUSTOMER, FEARS OF

21:02.867 --> 21:04.934
JOB LOSSES TURNED OUT TO BE

21:05.000 --> 21:06.467
COMPLETELY OVERBLOWN, BECAUSE

21:06.533 --> 21:08.734
BANK TELLER EMPLOYMENT ACTUALLY

21:08.800 --> 21:10.066
INCREASED OVER THE NEXT 30

21:10.133 --> 21:11.967
YEARS.

21:12.033 --> 21:13.467
WHAT HAPPENED WAS, ATMs TOOK

21:13.533 --> 21:15.900
OVER THE JOB OF DISPENSING CASH

21:15.967 --> 21:17.000
AND TELLERS WERE THEN FREED UP

21:17.066 --> 21:18.333
TO DO SALES OR OTHER WORK.

21:18.400 --> 21:19.667
THEIR JOBS DIDN'T GO; THEY

21:19.734 --> 21:21.200
CHANGED.

21:21.266 --> 21:22.700
AND WHEN AUTOMATION DOES LEAD TO

21:22.767 --> 21:24.066
JOB LOSS IN CERTAIN SECTORS,

21:24.133 --> 21:26.734
HISTORICALLY, IT'S ALSO CREATED

21:26.800 --> 21:27.934
JOBS, AS THIS ECONOMIST FROM MIT

21:28.000 --> 21:29.600
EXPLAINS.

21:29.667 --> 21:30.633
>> SO LET'S DO THE FOLLOWING

21:30.700 --> 21:32.000
THOUGHT EXERCISE.

21:32.066 --> 21:34.233
IT'S THE YEAR 1900, AND 40% OF

21:34.300 --> 21:36.266
ALL EMPLOYMENT IS IN

21:36.333 --> 21:37.967
AGRICULTURE, RIGHT?

21:38.033 --> 21:40.100
AND SO SOME TWERPY ECONOMIST

21:40.166 --> 21:42.266
FROM MIT TELEPORTS BACK IN TIME

21:42.333 --> 21:44.400
AND SAYS, "A HUNDRED YEARS FROM

21:44.467 --> 21:46.834
NOW, ONLY 2% OF PEOPLE WILL BE

21:46.900 --> 21:48.433
WORKING IN AGRICULTURE.

21:48.500 --> 21:50.400
WHAT DO YOU THINK THE OTHER 38%

21:50.467 --> 21:51.633
OF PEOPLE ARE GONNA DO?"

21:51.700 --> 21:53.133
>> WELL, I WOULDN'T KNOW.

21:53.200 --> 21:54.133
>> YOU WOULDN'T SAY, "OH, SEARCH

21:54.200 --> 21:56.667
ENGINE OPTIMIZATION."

21:56.734 --> 21:57.767
YOU KNOW, "HEALTH AND WELLNESS,

21:57.834 --> 21:58.867
SOFTWARE AND MOBILE DEVICES."

21:58.934 --> 22:00.000
MOST OF WHAT WE DO BARELY

22:00.066 --> 22:00.667
EXISTED.

22:00.734 --> 22:03.233
>> John: EXACTLY.

22:03.300 --> 22:04.633
THAT TWERPY ECONOMIST IS RIGHT.

22:04.700 --> 22:05.900
50 YEARS FROM NOW, PEOPLE WILL

22:05.967 --> 22:08.233
BE DOING JOBS WE CAN'T IMAGINE

22:08.300 --> 22:11.633
RIGHT NOW, LIKE CRYPTOBAKER,

22:11.700 --> 22:13.467
SNAIL REHYDRATOR, OR INVESTMENT

22:13.533 --> 22:14.600
HARPIST.

22:14.667 --> 22:15.400
I DON'T KNOW.

22:15.467 --> 22:16.767
THE POINT IS, YOU CAN'T IMAGINE

22:16.834 --> 22:25.667
THEM.

22:25.734 --> 22:27.734
SO WE GET RID OF SOME JOBS BUT

22:27.800 --> 22:32.266
WE CREATE NEW ONES.

22:32.333 --> 22:33.200
THE PROBLEM IS, THE NEW JOBS

22:33.266 --> 22:34.000
AUTOMATION CREATES WON'T

22:34.066 --> 22:34.800
NECESSARILY PAY THE SAME AS THE

22:34.867 --> 22:36.066
ONES IT TAKES AWAY, AND IT MIGHT

22:36.133 --> 22:36.600
NOT BE EASY FOR DISPLACED

22:36.667 --> 22:37.600
WORKERS TO TRANSITION INTO THEM.

22:37.667 --> 22:38.900
FOR INSTANCE, RIGHT NOW, OUR

22:38.967 --> 22:39.533
ECONOMY IS CREATING LOTS OF JOBS

22:39.600 --> 22:40.133
IN THE TECH SECTOR.

22:40.200 --> 22:40.700
AT THE SAME TIME, WE HAVE

22:40.767 --> 22:41.667
3.5 MILLION TRUCKERS POSSIBLY

22:41.734 --> 22:42.567
FACING UNEMPLOYMENT DUE TO

22:42.633 --> 22:46.266
DRIVERLESS TECHNOLOGY.

22:46.333 --> 22:47.967
NOW, IN AN IDEAL WORLD, THOSE

22:48.033 --> 22:48.834
TRUCKERS COULD SEAMLESSLY MOVE

22:48.900 --> 22:49.400
INTO HIGH-TECH JOBS.

22:49.467 --> 22:50.533
BUT AS THIS MAN EXPLAINS, IT'S

22:50.600 --> 22:50.967
JUST NOT THAT EASY.

22:51.033 --> 22:51.734
>> IF THE AVERAGE AGE IS 55,

22:51.800 --> 22:52.533
THESE GUYS ARE GOING TO BE

22:52.600 --> 22:53.567
COMPUTER PROGRAMMERS WHEN THEY

22:53.633 --> 22:54.667
DIDN'T FINISH HIGH SCHOOL?

22:54.734 --> 22:56.033
I DOUBT IT.

22:56.100 --> 22:58.233
>> John: OF COURSE.

22:58.300 --> 22:59.533
MAYBE SOME 55-YEAR-OLD TRUCK

22:59.600 --> 23:00.500
DRIVERS WILL BECOME WEB

23:00.567 --> 23:01.767
DESIGNERS, BUT IF YOU THINK ALL

23:01.834 --> 23:03.033
OF THEM WILL, IT MIGHT BE WORTH

23:03.100 --> 23:04.700
REMEMBERING THAT TIME YOUR

23:04.767 --> 23:06.033
FATHER ACCIDENTALLY TYPED HIS

23:06.100 --> 23:07.567
GOOGLE SEARCH INTO FACEBOOK AND

23:07.633 --> 23:13.700
THEN TRIED TO COVER IT UP BY

23:13.767 --> 23:14.633
PUTTING WITE-OUT ON THE

23:14.700 --> 23:15.433
COMPUTER.

23:15.500 --> 23:16.166
SO THE BIG QUESTION HERE IS, HOW

23:16.233 --> 23:16.900
DO YOU HARNESS WHAT IS GOOD

23:16.967 --> 23:18.166
ABOUT AUTOMATION WHILE

23:18.233 --> 23:18.767
MINIMIZING THE DAMAGE TO THOSE

23:18.834 --> 23:23.100
HURT BY IT?

23:23.166 --> 23:24.367
WELL, THE BEST THING WOULD BE IF

23:24.433 --> 23:24.967
AMERICA WERE IN THE HANDS OF

23:25.033 --> 23:25.867
SOMEONE NIMBLE AND

23:25.934 --> 23:26.600
FORWARD-THINKING.

23:26.667 --> 23:27.800
AND UNFORTUNATELY, THAT BRINGS

23:27.867 --> 23:28.567
US BACK TO THIS GUY.

23:28.633 --> 23:29.567
AND HE HAS NOT DEMONSTRATED MUCH

23:29.633 --> 23:30.667
OF A GRASP ON THIS ISSUE.

23:30.734 --> 23:32.066
JUST LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED WITH

23:32.133 --> 23:33.066
A COMPANY CALLED CARRIER.

23:33.133 --> 23:34.233
YOU MAY REMEMBER RIGHT AFTER THE

23:34.300 --> 23:35.133
ELECTION, TRUMP, WITH THE AID OF

23:35.200 --> 23:36.667
A MASSIVE TAX BREAK, CONVINCED

23:36.734 --> 23:47.066
THE CEO OF CARRIER'S PARENT

23:47.133 --> 23:49.000
COMPANY, GREG HAYES, NOT TO MOVE

23:49.066 --> 23:49.934
ONE OF THEIR FACTORIES TO

23:50.000 --> 23:51.433
MEXICO.

23:51.500 --> 23:52.066
HE MADE A BIG DEAL OUT OF SAVING

23:52.133 --> 23:53.166
THOSE JOBS, AND HE WAS EXCITED

23:53.233 --> 23:54.567
ABOUT WHAT WAS COMING NEXT.

23:54.633 --> 23:55.900
>> THEY'RE GOING TO SPEND SO

23:55.967 --> 23:58.734
MUCH MONEY ON RENOVATING THIS

23:58.800 --> 24:00.567
PLANT, AND I SAID, "GREG, SAY

24:00.633 --> 24:01.233
THAT NUMBER," YOU KNOW, HE SAID

24:01.333 --> 24:01.934
"$16 MILLION."

24:02.000 --> 24:02.700
WELL, THE MINIMUM NUMBER IS 16,

24:02.767 --> 24:03.700
IT'S GONNA BE, IN MY OPINION, A

24:03.767 --> 24:04.200
LOT MORE THAN THAT.

24:04.266 --> 24:04.800
HE SAID, "WELL, I'D RATHER SAY

24:04.867 --> 24:05.433
THE LOWER NUMBER."

24:05.500 --> 24:06.133
SEE, I'D RATHER HAVE THEM SAY

24:06.200 --> 24:07.033
THE HIGHER NUMBER.

24:07.100 --> 24:07.633
SO I WON'T SAY IT.

24:07.700 --> 24:08.333
OKAY.

24:08.400 --> 24:09.000
IT'S JUST A DIFFERENCE IN

24:09.066 --> 24:09.767
PHILOSOPHY.

24:09.834 --> 24:10.567
DO YOU AGREE?

24:10.633 --> 24:11.166
BOTH ARE OKAY.

24:11.233 --> 24:11.800
BUT DIFFERENCE IN PHILOSOPHY.

24:11.867 --> 24:12.500
BUT THEY'RE GONNA SPEND MORE

24:12.567 --> 24:13.100
THAN 16, THEY'RE GONNA SPEND A

24:13.166 --> 24:13.934
LOT OF MONEY ON THE PLANT.

24:14.000 --> 24:14.567
>> John: "IT'S A DIFFERENCE IN

24:14.633 --> 24:15.333
PHILOSOPHY, YOU SEE?

24:15.400 --> 24:16.133
I WANNA LIE, HE DOESN'T WANNA

24:16.200 --> 24:17.033
LIE, BOTH ARE OKAY.

24:17.100 --> 24:18.533
I'M STILL GOING TO LIE TO YOU,

24:18.600 --> 24:19.367
I'M JUST GOING TO DO IT VAGUELY,

24:19.433 --> 24:25.033
FOR GREG.

24:25.100 --> 24:25.834
THIS LIE'S FOR YOU, GREG.

24:25.900 --> 24:26.934
GREG'S GOING TO SPEND WAY MORE

24:27.000 --> 24:28.066
THAN $16 MILLION ON THE PLANT."

24:28.133 --> 24:28.934
BUT HERE'S THE THING ABOUT THAT

24:29.000 --> 24:29.600
$16 MILLION.

24:29.667 --> 24:30.667
IT WASN'T ACTUALLY GOOD NEWS FOR

24:30.734 --> 24:31.867
THE WORKERS, AS GREG HAYES MADE

24:31.934 --> 24:35.533
CLEAR JUST A FEW DAYS LATER.

24:35.600 --> 24:36.567
>> WE'RE GONNA MAKE A

24:36.633 --> 24:37.600
$16 MILLION INVESTMENT IN THAT

24:37.667 --> 24:39.000
FACTORY IN INDIANAPOLIS TO

24:39.066 --> 24:40.000
AUTOMATE, TO DRIVE THE COSTS

24:40.066 --> 24:40.900
DOWN, SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO

24:40.967 --> 24:42.133
BE COMPETITIVE.

24:42.200 --> 24:43.100
WHAT THAT ULTIMATELY MEANS IS

24:43.166 --> 24:44.567
THERE WILL BE FEWER JOBS.

24:44.633 --> 24:47.600
>> John: OH, GREAT WORK,

24:47.667 --> 24:50.233
MR. PRESIDENT.

24:50.300 --> 24:50.834
SO BASICALLY, CARRIER WORKERS

24:50.900 --> 24:52.433
ARE STILL GOING TO LOSE THEIR

24:52.500 --> 24:54.367
JOBS.

24:54.433 --> 24:55.600
IT'S JUST THE GOVERNMENT HELPED

24:55.667 --> 24:56.233
PAY FOR THE ROBOTS THAT'LL

24:56.300 --> 24:58.567
REPLACE THEM.

24:58.633 --> 24:59.266
THAT IS THE CLASSIC TRUMP

24:59.333 --> 25:00.066
DEAL-MAKING THAT YOU CAN READ

25:00.133 --> 25:00.834
ABOUT IN HIS BEST-SELLING BOOK

25:00.900 --> 25:01.633
"THE ART OF SAYING WHATEVER AND

25:01.700 --> 25:02.500
LETTING SOMEONE ELSE, A

25:02.567 --> 25:03.667
DIFFERENT PERSON OR, HEY, MAYBE

25:03.734 --> 25:04.600
EVEN A ROBOT, DEAL WITH THE

25:04.667 --> 25:05.033
CONSEQUENCES.

25:05.100 --> 25:06.033
IS THAT A GOOD TITLE?

25:06.100 --> 25:06.834
WHY NOT?

25:06.900 --> 25:08.300
IT'S A MOOT POINT BECAUSE IT'S

25:08.367 --> 25:08.900
11:45 A.M., WHICH IS BASICALLY

25:08.967 --> 25:13.500
NOON, SO THAT'S LUNCH."

25:13.567 --> 25:14.767
AND THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S

25:14.834 --> 25:16.266
RESPONSE TO AUTOMATION HONESTLY

25:16.333 --> 25:17.333
HASN'T GOTTEN MUCH BETTER SINCE,

25:17.400 --> 25:19.100
BECAUSE FOR SOMEONE WHO CLAIMS

25:19.166 --> 25:20.567
HE CARES SO MUCH ABOUT THE

25:20.633 --> 25:21.834
AMERICAN WORKER, HE'S DONE

25:21.900 --> 25:23.367
ALMOST NOTHING TO HELP PEOPLE

25:23.433 --> 25:24.500
DISPLACED BY AUTOMATION, AND

25:24.567 --> 25:26.200
THERE IS, FRANKLY, PLENTY HE

25:26.266 --> 25:27.633
COULD BE DOING.

25:27.700 --> 25:29.233
ONE SET OF PROPOSALS INCLUDES

25:29.300 --> 25:30.800
FUNDING RETRAINING, IDEALLY,

25:30.867 --> 25:32.233
RETRAINING THAT'S DIRECTLY

25:32.266 --> 25:33.400
TAILORED TO AVAILABLE JOBS IN

25:33.433 --> 25:35.066
YOUR AREA.

25:35.133 --> 25:36.300
THAT SEEMS LIKE A SENSIBLE IDEA,

25:36.367 --> 25:37.633
AS DOES TRYING TO HELP OLDER

25:37.700 --> 25:39.233
WORKERS WHO MAY END UP HAVING TO

25:39.300 --> 25:40.834
TAKE A NEW JOB WITH A LOWER

25:40.900 --> 25:42.033
SALARY THROUGH THINGS LIKE

25:42.100 --> 25:43.133
WAGE INSURANCE OR AN EXPANDED

25:43.200 --> 25:45.133
EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT.

25:45.200 --> 25:47.233
NOW, ALL OF THAT WILL COST MONEY

25:47.300 --> 25:48.367
AND QUITE A LOT OF IT, SO TRUMP

25:48.433 --> 25:49.967
WILL PROBABLY REVERT TO HIS

25:50.033 --> 25:51.266
PREFERRED SOLUTION, BLAMING

25:51.333 --> 25:52.567
CHINA, VIETNAM, AND OTHER

25:52.633 --> 25:54.300
COUNTRIES YOU'VE PROBABLY NEVER

25:54.367 --> 25:56.133
EVEN HEARD OF.

25:56.200 --> 25:57.667
SO IN THE MEANTIME, WE NEED TO

25:57.734 --> 25:59.600
START PREPARING YOUNGER WORKERS

25:59.667 --> 26:00.600
FOR THE JOB MARKET THEY'RE ABOUT

26:00.667 --> 26:01.934
TO ENTER, BECAUSE THE PACE OF

26:02.000 --> 26:03.867
TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE IS NOW SO

26:03.934 --> 26:05.266
RAPID, SOME EXPERTS SUGGEST THAT

26:05.333 --> 26:06.967
WE MIGHT NEED TO START

26:07.033 --> 26:08.100
RETHINKING OUR BASIC CONCEPTION

26:08.166 --> 26:10.600
OF A CAREER.

26:10.667 --> 26:12.100
>> THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WILL

26:12.166 --> 26:13.033
END UP HAVING AN EPISODIC

26:13.100 --> 26:14.300
CAREER.

26:14.367 --> 26:15.200
IT'S GREAT TO ASK KIDS, FOR

26:15.266 --> 26:16.367
EXAMPLE, WHAT DO YOU WANT TO BE

26:16.433 --> 26:17.967
WHEN YOU GROW UP?

26:18.033 --> 26:19.600
BUT ONE THING THAT MIGHT BE

26:19.667 --> 26:22.133
ADDED TO THAT QUESTION IS, WHAT

26:22.200 --> 26:24.000
FIVE THINGS DO YOU WANT TO BE

26:24.066 --> 26:26.100
WHEN YOU GROW UP?

26:26.166 --> 26:27.266
>> John: SHE'S RIGHT ABOUT THAT,

26:27.333 --> 26:29.367
AND THAT MEANS THE GIRL FROM

26:29.433 --> 26:30.600
BEFORE WHO SAID "MERMAID DOCTOR"

26:30.667 --> 26:32.133
MAY NEED TO COME UP WITH SOME

26:32.200 --> 26:34.200
BACKUP PLANS, PARTLY BECAUSE

26:34.266 --> 26:36.300
THAT JOB MAY BE PARTIALLY

26:36.367 --> 26:37.333
AUTOMATED IN THE FUTURE, AND

26:37.400 --> 26:39.033
PARTLY BECAUSE, LET'S BE HONEST,

26:39.100 --> 26:40.433
RISING OCEAN TEMPERATURES ARE

26:40.500 --> 26:41.200
GOING TO KILL ALL THE MERMAIDS.

26:41.266 --> 26:42.400
IT'S JUST A FACT.

26:42.467 --> 26:43.166
THEY'RE GOING TO BE BOILED

26:43.233 --> 26:45.800
ALIVE.

26:45.867 --> 26:47.734
AND LOOK, I'VE THROWN A LOT OF

26:47.800 --> 26:48.600
COMPLICATION AT YOU TONIGHT, BUT

26:48.667 --> 26:49.667
THE ONE THING WE KNOW FOR SURE

26:49.734 --> 26:51.333
IS, AUTOMATION IS NOT GOING TO

26:51.400 --> 26:53.834
STOP, AND SOME PEOPLE ARE GOING

26:53.900 --> 26:55.433
TO LOSE THEIR JOBS.

26:55.500 --> 26:57.367
SO WE SHOULD HELP THOSE THAT DO

26:57.433 --> 26:58.934
AND BE PREPARING THE NEXT

26:59.000 --> 27:01.800
GENERATION FOR THE POSSIBILITY

27:01.867 --> 27:02.800
THAT THEY MAY NEED TO BE MORE

27:02.867 --> 27:05.300
FLEXIBLE IN THEIR CAREER PLANS.

27:05.367 --> 27:06.333
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO BE

27:06.400 --> 27:07.033
WHEN YOU GROW UP?

27:07.100 --> 27:08.400
>> I WANT TO BE AN INVENTOR.

27:16.967 --> 27:18.700

27:18.767 --> 27:19.600
>> John: SO ARE YOU WORRIED

27:19.667 --> 27:20.900
ABOUT ROBOTS TAKING OVER CERTAIN

27:20.967 --> 27:22.100
JOBS?

27:22.166 --> 27:23.266
>> NO.

27:23.333 --> 27:24.834
>> John: OKAY, YOU MIGHT NEED TO

27:24.900 --> 27:27.100
BE AWARE OF THAT LONG-TERM.

27:27.166 --> 27:28.600
TELL YOU WHAT, YOU NAME SOME

27:28.667 --> 27:30.867
JOBS, AND I WILL TELL YOU

27:30.934 --> 27:32.100
WHETHER I THINK A ROBOT COULD DO

27:32.166 --> 27:33.000
IT OR NOT, OKAY?

27:33.066 --> 27:35.433
>> POLICEMAN.

27:35.500 --> 27:36.433
>> John: A ROBOT COULD DO THAT.

27:36.500 --> 27:37.333
THAT'S LITERALLY THE PLOT OF

27:37.400 --> 27:40.300
"ROBOCOP."

27:40.367 --> 27:41.200
>> FOOD, LIKE, AT A DINER.

27:41.266 --> 27:42.834

27:42.900 --> 27:43.367
DO THAT, ZOE, SORRY.

27:43.433 --> 27:44.000
>> CAN A ROBOT GET WET?

27:44.066 --> 27:44.734
>> John: YEAH, A ROBOT CAN GET

27:44.800 --> 27:45.600
WET.

27:45.667 --> 27:46.333
THAT'S NOT A JOB, BUT A ROBOT

27:46.400 --> 27:49.333
CAN GET WET.

27:49.400 --> 27:49.934
>> FIREMAN.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.734

>> A DRUMMER.

27:59.400 --> 27:59.967
>> John: OH, A ROBOT

28:00.033 --> 28:00.567
COULD DEFINITELY DO THE DRUMS.

28:00.633 --> 28:01.233
>> THEY'D BE PROBABLY REALLY BAD

28:01.300 --> 28:01.767
AT BASKETBALL.

28:01.834 --> 28:02.433
>> John: ROBOTS ARE ACTUALLY

28:02.500 --> 28:02.967
INCREDIBLE AT BASKETBALL.

28:03.033 --> 28:05.834
>> WHAT?

28:05.900 --> 28:06.400
>> John: LOOK AT THIS.

28:06.467 --> 28:07.333
I'M GOING TO GOOGLE "ROBOT

28:07.400 --> 28:08.200

28:08.266 --> 28:09.066
I JUST PUT "ROBOT D" AND IT

28:09.133 --> 28:11.467
AUTOCORRECTED.

28:13.567 --> 28:14.266
FASTER THAN A ROBOT?

28:14.333 --> 28:15.900

28:15.967 --> 28:16.834
>> John: HERE'S THE THING,

28:16.900 --> 28:22.400
YOU'RE DEFINITELY NOT.

28:22.467 --> 28:23.533
LET ME SHOW YOU THIS.

28:23.600 --> 28:24.233
DO YOU THINK A ROBOT COULD DO MY

28:24.300 --> 28:25.600
JOB IN THE FUTURE?

28:25.667 --> 28:27.934
>> WHAT IS YOUR JOB ANYWAY?

28:28.000 --> 28:28.700
>> John: I TAKE A BIG STORY AND

28:28.767 --> 28:29.834
WE TRY TO INJECT IT WITH AS MUCH

28:29.900 --> 28:31.600
NUANCE AS WE CAN.

28:31.667 --> 28:33.700
SO WE REALLY TRY AND GET A DEEP

28:33.767 --> 28:37.734
DIVE INTO COMPLICATED ISSUES,

28:37.800 --> 28:39.667

28:46.600 --> 28:47.900
>> IT'S REALLY HARD.

28:47.967 --> 28:49.066
>> WELL, WHAT CAN I DO?

28:49.133 --> 28:54.100
>> John: WHAT CAN YOU DO?

28:54.166 --> 28:54.633
THAT IS A GOOD QUESTION.

28:54.700 --> 28:55.567
YOU CAN DO A SERIES OF

28:55.633 --> 28:56.166
NONROUTINE TASKS THAT REQUIRE

28:56.233 --> 28:56.734
SOCIAL INTELLIGENCE, COMPLEX

28:56.800 --> 28:57.400
