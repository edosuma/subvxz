ah, this is starting

17:47.332 --> 17:50.101

There is a point to this, right?

18:04.583 --> 18:08.786
Well, yeah, the point is,
is you got to have a scene

18:08.787 --> 18:12.290
where the hero talks about
losing his rubber ducky

18:12.291 --> 18:14.625

18:14.626 --> 18:15.726

going to camp could be fun.
