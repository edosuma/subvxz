WEBVTT

00:09.160 --> 00:13.440
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:13.680 --> 00:15.200
<i>Oh, the next morning...</i>

00:15.280 --> 00:18.800
<i>How do you deal with the hangover</i>
<i>from partying and from losing?</i>

00:20.640 --> 00:22.640
Good morning, <i>The Circle!</i>

00:22.720 --> 00:24.720
Ana has joined...

00:25.160 --> 00:27.600
Her first act was losing the game, right?

00:28.960 --> 00:32.560
She thought she would kill it
and ended up with no pizza.

00:33.040 --> 00:36.040
Today I'll make voodoo dolls
of the other players.

00:40.600 --> 00:43.680
<i>I came to The Circle</i>
<i>Solely to win</i>

00:43.760 --> 00:46.480
<i>I'm not two-faced</i>
<i>I won't try to hide</i>

00:46.560 --> 00:48.360
<i>Does JP sleep at the gym?</i>

00:52.280 --> 00:54.400
"Update your status."

00:54.480 --> 00:56.240
Damn, will there be new pics?

00:56.320 --> 00:59.080
Status, Marcel.
Do you know what status is?

01:00.080 --> 01:02.120
"How are you feeling today?"

01:02.640 --> 01:03.680
Fulfilled!

01:03.760 --> 01:06.720
Very proud of the Pink Team!
Exclamation mark.

01:06.800 --> 01:09.360
I didn't have pizza,

01:09.440 --> 01:11.320
but my ass gets bigger anyway.

01:11.880 --> 01:16.960
Circle, like Ana's status.

01:17.040 --> 01:19.160
She's so perfect.

01:19.240 --> 01:21.760
Ass is like fart.
You read these words, you chuckle.

01:21.840 --> 01:23.840
Circle, write it down.

01:23.920 --> 01:26.840
Good morning, #Circle.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.920
Let's put to good use

01:29.000 --> 01:31.120
this machine of winning

01:31.200 --> 01:33.080
we have within ourselves.

01:33.160 --> 01:34.040
Rocket emoji.

01:36.240 --> 01:38.360
Here comes Akel. Little rocket.

01:38.440 --> 01:40.720
Cheesy as always.

01:40.800 --> 01:43.200
But I won't be against
a motivational message.

01:43.280 --> 01:44.760
Like Akel's status.

01:45.160 --> 01:46.440
JP liked it.

01:46.520 --> 01:47.560
Something's off.

01:47.640 --> 01:50.080
Circle, update my status.

01:50.160 --> 01:51.680
Whoo-hoo!

01:52.040 --> 01:53.360
Go, Team Blue.

01:53.440 --> 01:56.520
That's what I call team play.

01:57.480 --> 01:59.720
Well, I hope Lo understands

02:00.200 --> 02:02.200
that I won't like her status

02:02.280 --> 02:04.280
because she's talking about Team Blue.

02:04.640 --> 02:06.360
And I'm competitive.

02:06.440 --> 02:08.840
Marina didn't like Lorayne's status?

02:09.600 --> 02:11.440
Did they break up?

02:11.520 --> 02:13.080
What's going on?

02:13.640 --> 02:14.920
Alright.

02:16.160 --> 02:17.800
If that's how you want it...

02:18.600 --> 02:19.800
Seize the day

02:20.240 --> 02:21.800
like there's no tomorrow.

02:21.880 --> 02:23.960
#AllInTheSameBoat.

02:24.040 --> 02:25.920
"#AllInTheSameBoat?"

02:26.960 --> 02:28.480
Are you crazy, dude?

02:28.960 --> 02:32.320
I don't have a reason to like his status.

02:32.400 --> 02:34.240
It would harm my credibility.

02:34.320 --> 02:37.040
Circle, show who liked my status.

02:38.800 --> 02:40.080
Oh, Akel...

02:40.840 --> 02:43.000
If he chose not to like mine,

02:44.000 --> 02:46.600
then, my friend, I'm unliking his.

02:47.480 --> 02:48.520
I'm not afraid.

02:49.040 --> 02:49.920
Look.

02:50.480 --> 02:51.760
They're fighting again.

02:51.840 --> 02:53.280
JP unliked it.

02:53.360 --> 02:55.240
If he's Influencer again, I'm out.

02:55.320 --> 02:56.560
If you want war,

02:57.200 --> 02:58.440
you'll have war.

02:58.520 --> 03:00.760
<i>Guns, bombs and unlikes.</i>

03:05.680 --> 03:09.520
I'm going from <i>The Circle</i>
straight to the circus.

03:09.600 --> 03:12.760
<i>But the circus isn't handing out</i>
<i>300.000 reais, is it, love?</i>

03:15.480 --> 03:17.520
<i>Wow, what are the odds?</i>

03:18.040 --> 03:21.440
<i>Well, in </i>The Circle,
<i>unlikely stuff happens.</i>

03:21.960 --> 03:22.800
Circle,

03:22.880 --> 03:27.800
open a group chat with Ana and Marina.

03:27.880 --> 03:30.000
@JP HAS INVITED YOU TO A GROUP CHAT

03:31.920 --> 03:32.840
Circle,

03:33.560 --> 03:35.040
open chat with JP.

03:36.680 --> 03:39.120
Oh, my God.
What kind of group is this, JP?

03:39.200 --> 03:41.680
Marina and me is understandable. But JP?

03:41.760 --> 03:43.800
Do you want to talk panties, JP?

03:43.880 --> 03:46.960
Girls, good morning.
The idea behind this chat

03:47.040 --> 03:49.640
is getting closer
to these wonderful Carioca girls.

03:49.720 --> 03:51.080
Circle, send.

03:51.520 --> 03:52.760
Circle, message.

03:53.640 --> 03:55.280
What's that, JP?

03:55.360 --> 03:58.400
You're Team Blue. Get out.

03:58.480 --> 04:01.600
#TrollingHard. Send.

04:01.680 --> 04:03.480
Don't even start, girl.

04:03.560 --> 04:04.680
Circle, message.

04:04.760 --> 04:08.000
Marina is an old-timer,
but Ana just got here.

04:08.080 --> 04:10.680
What are your first impressions?

04:10.760 --> 04:12.680
Suspicious of anyone in particular?

04:13.240 --> 04:15.240
Thinking face emoji. Send.

04:15.320 --> 04:17.120
Yes. I'll talk about Akel.

04:17.200 --> 04:21.600
Akel didn't get likes from JP and Marina.

04:21.680 --> 04:22.800
Circle, message.

04:22.880 --> 04:25.520
I noticed that you didn't like
Akel's status...

04:25.600 --> 04:27.600
"...and that got me a little suspicious.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.120
I'm also trying to know..."

04:30.200 --> 04:31.680
"...a bit more from Lorayne."

04:31.760 --> 04:33.760
Oh, damn.

04:35.600 --> 04:38.680
Jeez, Ana is paying attention!

04:38.960 --> 04:41.120
She got here with her eyes wide open.

04:41.840 --> 04:43.120
Circle, message.

04:43.200 --> 04:45.600
Lorayne and Akel are playing dirty,

04:45.680 --> 04:46.880
backstabbing,

04:46.960 --> 04:49.520
trying to win everyone's favor
and staying on the fence.

04:49.600 --> 04:50.440
Send.

04:53.520 --> 04:55.120
Akel...

04:55.440 --> 04:59.160
e Lorayne: dishonest.

05:00.040 --> 05:02.800
Not what he said,
but that's what I choose to think.

05:02.880 --> 05:06.440
I totally agree about Akel playing dirty.

05:06.680 --> 05:07.560
Now,

05:07.640 --> 05:10.960
Lorayne? Are you sure, JP?

05:11.040 --> 05:12.440
Circle, message.

05:12.520 --> 05:14.040
It's okay to play.

05:14.360 --> 05:15.720
But not dirty.

05:15.800 --> 05:16.920
What about you, Marina?

05:17.240 --> 05:18.360
Circle, message.

05:18.440 --> 05:22.600
Ana, I gotta say
I find Akel very manipulative.

05:22.680 --> 05:25.800
Unfortunately, I can't trust him anymore.

05:26.400 --> 05:29.400
"As for Lorayne,
she's like a sister to me.

05:29.480 --> 05:31.640
However, I have some doubts

05:31.720 --> 05:34.120
about loyalty in <i>The Circle.</i>

05:34.960 --> 05:37.400
Maybe I shouldn't have mentioned Lorayne.

05:37.480 --> 05:40.080
Circle, message. That's it, folks.

05:40.160 --> 05:43.080
Don't mind us, we're very candid.

05:43.600 --> 05:44.800
Right, JP?

05:44.880 --> 05:45.960
Send.

05:46.600 --> 05:49.400
That's it, girls. Like Marina said,

05:49.480 --> 05:51.680
#HonestyAboveAll.

05:52.080 --> 05:52.920
Send.

05:53.840 --> 05:55.400
Circle, message.

05:56.240 --> 05:58.560
By now, I only got to meet you.

05:58.640 --> 06:02.440
"JP, thanks for the chat.
I feel more welcome."

06:02.840 --> 06:05.360
You'll always be welcome here, dear.

06:05.440 --> 06:07.400
JP is all about love.

06:08.640 --> 06:11.840
Now, what does Ana make of all this?

06:12.240 --> 06:13.840
This chat was very good

06:14.360 --> 06:16.760
because when the like situation happened,

06:16.840 --> 06:19.560
I started to notice
there was something wrong with Akel.

06:20.520 --> 06:21.640
There you have it.

06:22.080 --> 06:25.480
JP and Marina were bigmouthed and told me.

06:25.560 --> 06:28.280
<i>Fishing for allies season is open.</i>

06:28.640 --> 06:30.000
<i>Cast your net and good luck.</i>

06:32.400 --> 06:33.240
Circle,

06:33.320 --> 06:36.080
open private chat with Akel.

06:36.160 --> 06:37.320
Perhaps...

06:38.200 --> 06:41.280
it's time to put an end
to his relationship with Lorayne.

06:41.960 --> 06:43.360
@RAY INVITED YOU TO A CHAT

06:43.440 --> 06:44.680
Look.

06:44.760 --> 06:47.080
Circle, go to private chat.

06:48.120 --> 06:50.280
Circle, message.

06:50.760 --> 06:53.480
Hey, Akel, how are you doing?

06:53.560 --> 06:56.520
Before we start chatting, I ship us.

06:56.600 --> 06:59.480
#RaKel. Send.

07:01.160 --> 07:04.040
Our Lady of Abadia!

07:04.720 --> 07:07.520
This #RaKel thing got me in a pickle.

07:07.600 --> 07:10.240
Firstly, Lolo will want to kill her.

07:10.320 --> 07:12.960
Secondly, all my friends call me Rakel.

07:13.400 --> 07:17.000
If he rejects me,
I can say it's only friendship.

07:17.440 --> 07:19.680
#RaKel will be a "friends ship."

07:19.960 --> 07:21.560
Circle, message.

07:21.640 --> 07:23.720
What's up, Ray?

07:23.800 --> 07:25.640
I was looking forward to this chat.

07:25.720 --> 07:27.400
Circle, send.

07:30.640 --> 07:32.920
What a player, huh?

07:33.440 --> 07:35.200
Circle, message.

07:35.280 --> 07:36.880
I'm a bit confused.

07:36.960 --> 07:41.160
What's actually going on
between you and @Lorayne?

07:41.240 --> 07:44.920
She didn't say a whole lot about you.
#TellMe.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
Circle, send.

07:46.760 --> 07:47.680
Dang.

07:47.760 --> 07:49.680
She went straight for Lolo.

07:49.760 --> 07:53.400
Of course, we have a good relationship,

07:53.480 --> 07:56.280
but that doesn't stop me
from meeting new people,

07:56.360 --> 07:58.840
and I don't mean romance-wise,

07:58.920 --> 08:01.240
but in terms of making friends.

08:01.320 --> 08:06.160
If he says she's his partner,
I'll assume they're playing together.

08:06.240 --> 08:07.680
If he says otherwise,

08:08.080 --> 08:09.640
I could hit on him

08:10.120 --> 08:13.720
and try to sort of
rock their relationship.

08:13.800 --> 08:15.280
Circle, message.

08:15.880 --> 08:18.000
So... With many Os.

08:18.320 --> 08:21.080
Lolo and I hit it off

08:21.520 --> 08:25.080
right from the first day.
I have a lot of affection for her,

08:25.160 --> 08:27.520
but I'm here to get to know everyone.

08:27.600 --> 08:29.600
Ellipsis. Circle, send.

08:33.040 --> 08:34.720
He's playing with her.

08:34.800 --> 08:36.520
That says it all.

08:37.200 --> 08:39.680
That says it all.
I'm not telling you anything.

08:39.760 --> 08:41.040
Your neck is on the line.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.520
Rest assured. And I don't give a damn.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.920
Circle, message.

08:47.480 --> 08:49.080
I loved talking with you.

08:49.160 --> 08:51.560
It gave me some insights. #OnYouToes,

08:51.640 --> 08:53.440
#WomenCheatToo.

08:53.520 --> 08:56.640
This bit about women cheating
could mean two things.

08:57.040 --> 08:59.040
Either watch out for Lolo

08:59.120 --> 09:02.040
or you'd better get involved with me.

09:02.120 --> 09:04.640
I sowed discord. Let's see what I reap.

09:05.160 --> 09:07.320
<i>It could come back to bite you, Ray.</i>

09:07.720 --> 09:09.280
ALERT!

09:10.040 --> 09:11.600
"Alert!"

09:11.680 --> 09:12.840
Hey!

09:12.920 --> 09:14.880
You scared me, Circle!

09:14.960 --> 09:17.040
What now?

09:17.120 --> 09:18.160
It's something good.

09:18.240 --> 09:19.400
It's kind of early.

09:19.920 --> 09:21.160
Still sunny outside.

09:22.640 --> 09:24.280
"It's time for the ratings."

09:24.360 --> 09:25.360
What?

09:27.120 --> 09:28.280
I had already started.

09:30.040 --> 09:31.840
Is Luma ready for another one?

09:32.440 --> 09:35.000
I'm not gonna lie,
I'm super nervous about it.

09:36.360 --> 09:40.400
"As a new player, Ana will rate,
but cannot be rated."

09:40.480 --> 09:42.760
That happens when you're privileged.

09:42.840 --> 09:43.840
I've been there.

09:45.320 --> 09:47.320
#PEEPOOP

09:48.640 --> 09:51.280
Well, time to stir up some trouble.

09:51.360 --> 09:53.800
Ana, you're a sister to me!

09:53.880 --> 09:56.120
For Christ's sake, Ana!

09:57.200 --> 09:58.400
It's gonna be easy.

09:59.400 --> 10:00.560
It's hard...

10:01.400 --> 10:02.560
for whoever leaves.

10:02.640 --> 10:05.440
I want to go first. Please!

10:05.520 --> 10:07.680
I've never asked for anything. Please?

10:07.760 --> 10:09.200
In first place,

10:09.280 --> 10:11.400
I'd like to put Akel.

10:12.800 --> 10:14.480
Because I trust him a lot.

10:14.560 --> 10:17.360
I'm sure he will have my back

10:17.440 --> 10:19.840
just like I protected him last time.

10:19.920 --> 10:22.360
In fifth place, I'm putting...

10:23.240 --> 10:25.360
Dumaresq. He is...

10:25.440 --> 10:29.760
He's making allies
and becoming a very strong player,

10:30.280 --> 10:33.160
so he represents danger.

10:33.240 --> 10:35.280
Circle, in first place,

10:35.640 --> 10:36.960
Dumaresq.

10:37.680 --> 10:39.280
I want him up...

10:39.880 --> 10:40.760
in the ranks.

10:41.200 --> 10:43.600
He doesn't deserve to be down there.

10:43.680 --> 10:46.080
In second place, I'm nominating someone

10:46.160 --> 10:50.560
who I've been growing
increasingly fond of. Marina.

10:51.120 --> 10:54.880
If she continues to gain popularity,
then I'm safe.

10:54.960 --> 10:56.920
I felt...

10:57.000 --> 11:00.760
something off about Marina earlier today,

11:00.840 --> 11:03.000
so I'm ranking Marina fourth.

11:03.640 --> 11:05.960
Girl, are you messing with me?

11:06.440 --> 11:09.440
Gosh, I don't know
if I'll play this hand right.

11:09.840 --> 11:11.160
In third place,

11:11.640 --> 11:12.880
Lorayne.

11:12.960 --> 11:15.120
I like her a lot, but I also think...

11:16.280 --> 11:19.280
you're acting like a mindless sheeple.

11:19.360 --> 11:22.960
Circle, in sixth place, I'm putting JP.

11:23.040 --> 11:27.000
I don't want him as an Influencer,
especially after our disagreement.

11:27.080 --> 11:31.000
I don't think he's prepared
for something that important.

11:31.080 --> 11:33.160
Are you sure we're ranking JP first?

11:33.240 --> 11:35.000
-Let's think about it.
-Marcel!

11:35.080 --> 11:37.000
Who else would it be?

11:37.080 --> 11:39.960
Circle, in first place, JP.

11:41.280 --> 11:42.360
In first place,

11:42.440 --> 11:45.040
I'm putting my Northern princess, Luma.

11:45.120 --> 11:49.840
She's proving to be a worthy ally
and we're sticking together till the end.

11:49.920 --> 11:52.960
I think my fifth place will be the person

11:53.040 --> 11:55.920
with whom I interacted the least.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.560
So, my fifth place

11:57.640 --> 11:58.920
will be Luma.

11:59.920 --> 12:03.000
In fifth place, please put Ray.

12:03.080 --> 12:07.400
I feel like she still hasn't made her mind
about everyone.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.960
Circle, in second place,

12:10.040 --> 12:11.280
Ray.

12:11.360 --> 12:12.920
Marcel...

12:13.000 --> 12:15.040
It's plain strategy.

12:15.120 --> 12:17.120
You think no one is gonna place her--

12:17.200 --> 12:20.040
Ray isn't that well-regarded.

12:20.120 --> 12:22.280
It's like we're throwing our vote away?

12:22.600 --> 12:23.440
Yes.

12:23.520 --> 12:26.840
Circle, send my ratings.

12:26.920 --> 12:29.240
RATINGS COMPLETE

12:29.320 --> 12:31.040
"Ratings complete."

12:31.720 --> 12:33.400
The coin has been tossed.

12:33.720 --> 12:36.400
Let's hope for the best.

12:36.480 --> 12:39.240
It all depends on who gets voted
as the Influencer.

12:39.800 --> 12:42.000
I'm confident...

12:42.080 --> 12:43.520
that I'm gonna rank well.

12:43.600 --> 12:45.320
Way up there.

12:45.400 --> 12:49.800
<i>I envy the self-esteem.</i>
<i>Are you sure you're looking so good?</i>

12:54.560 --> 12:56.360
<i>We're going to find that out now.</i>

12:56.440 --> 12:59.760
<i>Because everyone is painting</i>
<i>another player's portrait.</i>

13:02.360 --> 13:05.640
<i>Circle has randomly selected</i>
<i>who each player will-- let's call it…</i>

13:05.960 --> 13:07.160

13:07.240 --> 13:09.760
Let's do this! Let's paint freaking Akel.

13:09.840 --> 13:12.200
I'm giving you a tan, alright, JP?

13:12.720 --> 13:14.120
Thank me later.

13:14.200 --> 13:16.680
I'll need all the colors...

13:17.720 --> 13:19.360
because Dumaresq likes colors.

13:19.440 --> 13:22.720
I wanna represent Lorayne the way I feel

13:22.800 --> 13:24.520
like she is in here.

13:24.600 --> 13:25.760
<i>Meaning...</i>

13:25.840 --> 13:27.320
When I think about Ana,

13:27.400 --> 13:30.160
I picture a faux queen in drag.

13:30.240 --> 13:34.120
My art teachers would always say,
"Looking good, João! So beautiful!"

13:34.200 --> 13:37.360
Just to cheer me up.
Art was never my strong suit.

13:43.280 --> 13:44.800
Just like I pictured it.

13:44.880 --> 13:46.360
It's damn good.

13:47.800 --> 13:51.120
"All pictures are going to be uploaded

13:51.640 --> 13:55.720

13:59.440 --> 14:02.000
Oh, gosh, it's my painting.

14:03.600 --> 14:04.840
Look at that!

14:04.920 --> 14:06.600
Is that thing a foot?

14:06.680 --> 14:08.600
That foot went right over my head.

14:08.680 --> 14:10.560
Cracked heels!

14:10.640 --> 14:12.320
Cracked-heels Northern.

"This is JP's portrait."

14:37.040 --> 14:39.880
I hope Akel did it.

14:40.280 --> 14:43.000
I hope there's battle brewing.

14:43.080 --> 14:45.360
<i>You got it right, Ana!</i>

14:46.360 --> 14:47.600
PUTS OUT FLAMES

14:51.840 --> 14:53.360
"Puts out flames"?

Lorayne, Marina and Dumaresq,

15:42.600 --> 15:45.120
then I'm on the right path.

15:46.720 --> 15:49.440
I'm up next. Let's see what it looks like.

15:49.520 --> 15:53.120
It's going to be good, I can feel it.
Let's see how it came out.

15:56.320 --> 15:58.320
Damn!

15:58.400 --> 15:59.840
Holy Mother.

15:59.920 --> 16:05.720
Jesus Freaking Christ!

16:06.280 --> 16:09.080
It's Akel with a leash...

16:09.480 --> 16:11.760
A dog taking a dump.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.080
It must have been JP.

16:26.880 --> 16:29.760

Is it so cryptic?

16:30.160 --> 16:33.040
If you look closely,
it's not a dog, folks.

16:33.120 --> 16:36.840
It's a possessed ram
with the face of the devil.

A mediocre message like that
won Dumaresq over.

23:04.640 --> 23:05.520
Send.

23:06.160 --> 23:07.680
I'm such a liar.

23:07.760 --> 23:08.840
Who painted him?

23:09.400 --> 23:10.280
I did.

23:12.920 --> 23:15.760
Girl, you're too much!

23:15.840 --> 23:18.520
Circle, message.

23:18.600 --> 23:21.200
I loved my portrait too.

23:21.280 --> 23:26.040
Honey, lots of love and count on me!

23:26.120 --> 23:27.040
Send.

23:28.160 --> 23:29.000
XOXO.

23:29.600 --> 23:32.800
Thanks for the chat, bro-- Baby!

23:33.440 --> 23:34.840
Hold on.

23:35.360 --> 23:38.600
XOXO, thanks for the chat, baby.

23:38.680 --> 23:39.640
Circle, send.

23:40.760 --> 23:45.560
Oh, Ana, I loved our little chat.

23:45.960 --> 23:48.040
I'm starting to get attached to Dumaresq.

23:48.120 --> 23:50.160
I admit I was picking on him,

23:50.240 --> 23:51.960
but I also admit

23:52.040 --> 23:54.080
it's time to stop

23:54.160 --> 23:56.600
because he's nice, he's a good guy!

23:57.400 --> 24:00.520
<i>May this friendship last</i>
<i>for many, many likes.</i>

24:09.200 --> 24:13.400
I smell something off about Marina,
which I don't like.

24:13.480 --> 24:16.640
I don't like this feeling,
because I trust and like Marina.

24:17.080 --> 24:20.160
If we got back on good terms

24:20.240 --> 24:23.680
and figured out who painted
our portraits and why,

24:24.280 --> 24:26.040
we could be friends again.

24:26.120 --> 24:29.200
Circle, open private chat with Marina.

24:31.520 --> 24:34.720
"Lorayne has invited you
to a private chat."

24:35.920 --> 24:37.480
Oh, God...

24:38.120 --> 24:40.240
Circle, open private chat with Lorayne.

24:41.240 --> 24:43.520
That's exactly what I needed.

24:44.080 --> 24:46.840
I know sometimes I get a bit upset

24:47.320 --> 24:51.520
with some of her attitudes,
but I don't mean her any harm.

24:51.960 --> 24:53.320
Circle, message.

24:53.400 --> 24:57.080
I feel like we've grown apart
since Lucas was blocked.

24:57.160 --> 24:59.480
Are you mad at me? Send.

25:00.680 --> 25:02.640
"Are you mad at me?"

25:04.800 --> 25:06.520
Circle, message.

25:06.600 --> 25:09.920
Of course I'm not mad at you

25:10.000 --> 25:11.840
for blocking Lucas.

25:11.920 --> 25:14.320
You had no option.

25:14.400 --> 25:16.800
#It'sPartOfTheGame.

25:16.920 --> 25:17.800
Send.

25:18.800 --> 25:22.000
Now that we're talking,
I feel so much honesty coming from her.

25:22.440 --> 25:24.680
Everybody's being two-faced
and playing dirty,

25:24.760 --> 25:29.760
so we must roll up our sleeves
and face the war.

25:29.840 --> 25:32.240
I want to talk about

25:32.320 --> 25:34.680
those freaking paintings.

25:34.760 --> 25:36.000
Circle, message.

25:36.080 --> 25:38.800
Those portraits put me on high alert.

25:38.880 --> 25:41.760
"I was trusting everyone,
but it's not that simple."

25:41.840 --> 25:44.600
If she reached out to me,
then she knows it wasn't me,

25:44.680 --> 25:46.600
which makes me so happy.

25:48.640 --> 25:51.200
That came from female hands.

25:51.280 --> 25:52.360
Circle, message.

25:52.440 --> 25:55.200
Jeez, girl. Ellipsis.

25:55.440 --> 25:58.960
I think our portraits
were super horrible.

25:59.040 --> 26:02.680
"Let's keep our eyes peeled
and trust our gut feelings.

26:02.760 --> 26:05.480
#ThemGirlsBetterPrepare."

26:05.560 --> 26:07.160
Does it really say "girls"?

26:08.520 --> 26:12.240
Damn, she's suspicious of the girls!

26:13.320 --> 26:14.720
Good God.

26:15.320 --> 26:17.120
Circle, message.

26:17.200 --> 26:18.240
It's so unfair.

26:18.560 --> 26:21.080
I think we're the most honest people here.

26:21.160 --> 26:23.240
And I was silly enough to cry.

26:23.720 --> 26:25.760
So relieved to talk to you, girl.

26:25.840 --> 26:28.480
I'm here for you too. Heart emoji.

26:28.560 --> 26:30.240
#ThemGirlsBetterPrepare.

26:30.320 --> 26:32.200
"#HereForYouSis."

26:32.920 --> 26:34.640
God, that's so good.

26:36.680 --> 26:38.680
Seriously, I'm touched.

26:40.120 --> 26:42.720
Speaking up is key.

26:42.800 --> 26:44.760
Otherwise, you're out.

26:44.840 --> 26:48.160
I needed that human warmth, you know?

26:48.800 --> 26:52.560
Because I'm so needy.

26:53.080 --> 26:55.080
The day she blocked Lucas

26:55.160 --> 26:57.600
I was kind of upset, I won't lie.

26:57.680 --> 27:01.720
Especially because she didn't
come up to me

27:01.800 --> 27:04.960
to ask me how I was doing.

27:05.040 --> 27:06.680
I was so crushed.

27:08.080 --> 27:10.720
To me, She Fights is dead and gone.

27:13.480 --> 27:15.480
<i>Wow, the end of an era.</i>

27:17.680 --> 27:19.960
<i>Perhaps Dumaresq is sensing the end?</i>

27:20.840 --> 27:21.760
ALERT!

27:21.840 --> 27:23.400
"Alert!"

27:23.480 --> 27:25.320
"Alert!"

27:26.880 --> 27:29.200
Oh, my God, what is it now?

27:29.280 --> 27:32.040
It could be anything, brother!

27:33.040 --> 27:34.240
Ratings, maybe?

27:35.240 --> 27:36.640
Dang!

27:37.120 --> 27:39.480
I just hope I don't cry my eyes out.

27:42.040 --> 27:44.720
"The rating results are in."

27:48.920 --> 27:51.520
Damn, it's time.

27:53.760 --> 27:56.040
In seventh and sixth places.

27:56.840 --> 27:57.760
I'm nervous.

27:57.840 --> 28:00.840
God forbid it's me.

28:00.920 --> 28:03.400
I don't want to see my picture.
Anything but that.

28:06.280 --> 28:09.360
Holy shit, man.

28:09.800 --> 28:13.440
From second to last is a lot!

28:14.360 --> 28:15.920
What the heck!

28:16.400 --> 28:18.320
Talk about a shock.

28:18.400 --> 28:20.400
From Influencer...

28:21.080 --> 28:23.960
Lorayne went down to seventh!

28:24.360 --> 28:26.640
Lorayne. I told you!

28:26.720 --> 28:30.240
I told you that group isn't...

28:30.320 --> 28:32.520
It's not helping at all.

28:32.600 --> 28:34.960
Baby, is this where we meet?

28:36.920 --> 28:39.440
What a terrible place to be united!

28:39.520 --> 28:42.600
<i>Mock away, Luma.</i>
<i>Who knows what tomorrow may bring?</i>

28:42.680 --> 28:46.240
She could be blocked now,
so we bury this couple right away.

28:46.320 --> 28:47.960
"She Fakes."

28:48.040 --> 28:50.440
That's how the group
was supposed to be called.

28:52.800 --> 28:55.280
Fourth and fifth places.

28:57.440 --> 28:59.200
JP has gotta rank low, man.

28:59.280 --> 29:03.400
I bet it will be Luma and Ray.

29:03.480 --> 29:04.960
I think it's Ray.

29:06.760 --> 29:09.360
Shit, I'm scared right now.

29:10.680 --> 29:13.000
Legit scared.

29:13.080 --> 29:14.360
The game is unpredictable.

29:14.440 --> 29:16.160
Each day a different result.

29:16.240 --> 29:18.240
Where's Auntie Luma?

29:18.320 --> 29:20.800
-Where's Luma?
-Marcel, screw that.

29:20.880 --> 29:22.920
-What?
-Never say "Auntie" again.

29:23.000 --> 29:26.880
That means I placed higher, you guys!

29:31.600 --> 29:35.560
<i>I'm so curious.</i>
<i>What will this Top Three look like?</i>

29:35.960 --> 29:38.800
Luma must not be an Influencer.

29:39.640 --> 29:41.160
Dumaresq, please.

29:41.240 --> 29:43.440
Dumaresq is up there for too long.

29:43.520 --> 29:45.240
Time for him to fall on his face.

29:45.320 --> 29:47.760
Ray...

29:48.120 --> 29:50.320
It's tiresome. It's good exercise...

29:50.400 --> 29:51.960
-Are you shaking?
-...for the arms.

29:54.000 --> 29:57.560
Oh, God. I'm getting there, Lord!

29:57.640 --> 29:59.640
Thank God!

30:01.000 --> 30:03.480
I'm completely lost in this game.

30:03.560 --> 30:07.840
North-Northeast, my girl Luma!

30:07.920 --> 30:10.480
-Luma is not celebrating.
-Hold your hips.

30:10.560 --> 30:12.040
Luma is not celebrating.

30:12.120 --> 30:14.240
-She's not.
-Don't tease.

30:15.640 --> 30:17.720
I want to twerk.

30:19.520 --> 30:20.560
Show it already.

30:20.640 --> 30:23.720
I don't want to waste too long
complimenting them.

30:34.760 --> 30:37.840
Luma is first!

30:41.520 --> 30:45.600
It's so good when this energy explodes.

30:50.280 --> 30:52.800
For Luma to become an Influencer,

30:52.880 --> 30:54.720
many people supported her.

30:56.040 --> 30:59.480
I ask myself,
"Who isn't afraid of going home?

30:59.880 --> 31:00.720
Who?"

31:00.800 --> 31:02.840
I'm literally shitting my pants.

31:02.920 --> 31:04.760
ALERT!

31:06.400 --> 31:07.520
"Alert!"

31:07.600 --> 31:09.720
Circle, for the love of God.

31:11.920 --> 31:14.080
"As the most popular players..."

31:14.160 --> 31:16.400
"...Luma and Dumaresq are now..."

31:16.480 --> 31:18.000
<i>"...The Circle</i> Influencers."

31:20.320 --> 31:22.080
Well done! Great duo!

31:22.160 --> 31:25.080
What a nice thing to read!

31:26.240 --> 31:28.600
"All other players failed..."

31:28.680 --> 31:30.920
"...and are at risk of being blocked."

31:31.200 --> 31:34.600
Well, it's more like Akel and I.

31:35.800 --> 31:36.800
"Luma and Dumaresq,

31:36.880 --> 31:38.680
please go to the Blue Room..."

31:38.760 --> 31:40.760
"...to make your decision."

31:43.560 --> 31:46.000
Luma always wanted to know the Blue Room.

31:46.080 --> 31:48.400
When you get there you're so tense

31:48.480 --> 31:50.520
that you can't enjoy the room.

31:50.960 --> 31:52.200
I'm done for.

31:53.840 --> 31:56.000
Oh, Marina, stop. Be optimistic.

31:56.080 --> 31:59.880
I've put myself in their shoes,
and I'd kick me out.

31:59.960 --> 32:02.280
Anyone who failed could be out.

32:14.720 --> 32:20.080
Oh, you guys, how I missed this place!

32:20.160 --> 32:23.560
It goes so well with my looks.

32:23.640 --> 32:26.920
<i>Northeast and North will have</i>
<i>an eternal mental picture of this room.</i>

32:27.000 --> 32:29.760
So this is the famous Blue Room.

32:30.240 --> 32:33.120
Where everything happens,
including blocks.

32:34.160 --> 32:38.240
Considering I relate to Luma
on so many ideas,

32:38.760 --> 32:43.320
I believe that our feelings
in regards to other players

32:43.640 --> 32:46.080
are going to line up.

32:46.160 --> 32:48.800
ALERT!

32:48.880 --> 32:51.280
"Alert!"

32:51.360 --> 32:54.160
"Alert!"

32:56.640 --> 33:01.400
"Influencers Luma and Dumaresq
are about to make a decision."

33:01.480 --> 33:05.800
"But before that,
all players must join The Circle chat."

33:07.360 --> 33:10.680
Oh, everybody is going to chat with us?

33:10.760 --> 33:12.760
They should face it

33:12.840 --> 33:15.800
as their last chance to speak up. I hope--

33:16.040 --> 33:17.080
This is new.

33:17.160 --> 33:18.480
Alright, let's go.

33:19.520 --> 33:21.880
"Each Influencer can save a player."

33:21.960 --> 33:23.240
That's new.

33:23.640 --> 33:25.000
What?

33:25.080 --> 33:28.560
It lowers the number of blockable people.

33:28.800 --> 33:30.120
Got it.

33:32.840 --> 33:35.200
That's crazy.

33:35.280 --> 33:37.280
Shit got serious.

33:37.360 --> 33:39.680
Who is Luma going to save?

33:40.800 --> 33:43.080
Will Luma take me with her?

33:44.280 --> 33:46.280
This can have many implications,

33:46.360 --> 33:49.560
because it exposes our game plan.

33:49.640 --> 33:52.720
God, I hope one of them saves me.

33:54.120 --> 33:55.400
Wow...

33:55.920 --> 33:58.200
I wonder if Dumaresq will save me?

33:59.880 --> 34:03.120
"Luma, choose one player to save

34:03.200 --> 34:05.040
and explain your reason."

34:06.640 --> 34:08.640
I'm taking the wig out, it's too hot.

34:09.520 --> 34:11.120
I think she'll pick JP.

34:11.200 --> 34:13.680
Let's see
if our alliance is worth anything.

34:13.760 --> 34:15.000
Circle, message.

34:15.440 --> 34:18.000
Following the ratings logic,

34:18.080 --> 34:20.520
taking the players' opinion
into consideration

34:20.600 --> 34:22.320
and being fair... Send.

34:23.520 --> 34:25.160
Oh, my God.

34:27.600 --> 34:30.080
The person I'm saving is...

34:30.160 --> 34:32.320
-Ellipsis.
-Send.

34:33.520 --> 34:34.360
It's time.

34:34.440 --> 34:35.800
Let's go.

34:37.400 --> 34:38.920
It's gotta be Ray.

34:39.400 --> 34:42.560
So suspenseful, sis!

34:42.960 --> 34:44.520
Go, honey.

34:44.880 --> 34:46.640
I believe you.

34:51.040 --> 34:55.520
God, thank you so much!
You're so awesome!

34:55.600 --> 34:57.600
That's it!

34:59.480 --> 35:01.920
I expected her to save me,

35:02.000 --> 35:04.040
but it's her strategy, right?

35:04.520 --> 35:06.520
She's protecting her own.

35:07.040 --> 35:10.440
Luma is getting
a bit more predictable to me.

35:10.520 --> 35:11.680
Luma saved Ray

35:12.120 --> 35:14.920
-to win...
-To strenghten their alliance.

35:15.520 --> 35:18.240
-And...
-Seeing that Ray placed third.

35:18.320 --> 35:22.160
I owe you, sis. Only one favor, though!

35:22.240 --> 35:24.160
Dumaresq is in a pickle.

35:24.240 --> 35:26.400
He either saves Lolo or Marina.

35:26.480 --> 35:28.120
Would he choose Akel?

35:28.200 --> 35:30.160
So, Dumaresq, what's up?

35:32.200 --> 35:33.720
Circle, message.

35:34.200 --> 35:36.960
Empathy is key.

35:37.240 --> 35:40.160
To have someone by your side

35:40.240 --> 35:43.040
makes things that much lighter.

35:43.560 --> 35:44.480
Send.

35:44.880 --> 35:45.920
Oh, Lord.

35:46.000 --> 35:47.720
What does he even mean?

35:49.760 --> 35:52.120
Oh, my God.

35:52.200 --> 35:54.200
Dumaresq keep typing.

35:55.280 --> 35:57.440
Calm down, princess. You're first place.

35:58.360 --> 36:01.040
Today I was told that this person

36:01.360 --> 36:04.160
said positive things about me.

36:04.240 --> 36:06.240
Attitude like this

36:06.320 --> 36:09.360
makes <i>The Circle </i>more human. Send.

36:09.440 --> 36:12.320
Oh... It's not me.

36:12.880 --> 36:15.280
I think it was Akel.

36:15.360 --> 36:16.520
Jesus Christ.

36:16.600 --> 36:19.760
This shit is thrilling.

36:19.840 --> 36:21.600
Circle, message.

36:22.040 --> 36:24.520
"The person I'm saving is..."

36:27.520 --> 36:28.400
Marina.

36:29.040 --> 36:31.120
If it's Akel or Lorayne...

36:39.480 --> 36:42.440
Marina is his best friend,
of course she speaks highly of him.

36:42.520 --> 36:45.040
Lolo, JP and myself. Good grief.

36:45.440 --> 36:48.200
What the hell! Shit's about to go down.

36:51.200 --> 36:52.320
Crazy.

36:52.400 --> 36:54.520
Marina and Ray are safe.

36:54.600 --> 36:56.040
She for she.

36:56.120 --> 36:57.640
She's gonna be so happy.

36:58.080 --> 37:00.760
And I'm happy to be able to save her.

37:01.200 --> 37:05.200
I did talk him up to Ana!

37:05.280 --> 37:06.400
In short,

37:06.480 --> 37:09.240
his saving Marina

37:09.320 --> 37:13.120
shows I can manipulate Dumaresq.

37:13.560 --> 37:15.360
Will I try to further manipulate him?

37:15.440 --> 37:16.560
You bet.

37:18.680 --> 37:21.080
ALERT!

37:21.160 --> 37:22.600
"Alert!"

37:25.720 --> 37:27.960
Oh, my freaking God.

37:32.280 --> 37:35.560
"Luma and Dumaresq must go
to the Influencers chat..."

37:35.640 --> 37:39.000
"...to figure out who to block."

37:39.080 --> 37:40.160
I'm safe.

37:40.240 --> 37:41.440
I don't give a damn.

37:45.320 --> 37:46.760
Are you nervous, hon?

37:48.160 --> 37:50.720
What a tense moment.

37:50.800 --> 37:53.480
Circle, open the Influencers chat.

37:55.720 --> 37:57.280
Circle, message.

37:57.360 --> 38:01.160
Time to talk serious business.

38:01.240 --> 38:02.280
Are you ready?

38:02.360 --> 38:03.320
Send.

38:04.400 --> 38:06.040
Circle, message.

38:06.120 --> 38:07.400
More than ready.

38:07.720 --> 38:10.040
Let's talk seriously. Send.

38:11.400 --> 38:12.600
Not even I feel

38:12.920 --> 38:15.880
"more than ready", baby.

38:15.960 --> 38:17.400
Let's start off with JP?

38:18.000 --> 38:19.600
Circle, message.

38:19.680 --> 38:21.760
Let's start off talking about JP.

38:21.840 --> 38:24.800
We talked privately
and I feel he's very genuine.

38:24.880 --> 38:29.600
My fear is that it's his strategy
to act like this with everyone.

38:29.680 --> 38:30.600
Send.

38:32.120 --> 38:34.240
In regards to JP,

38:34.320 --> 38:38.360
I've also had
very productive talks with him.

38:38.840 --> 38:39.800
However,

38:39.880 --> 38:44.320
I was told he wanted to block Akel

38:44.880 --> 38:49.320
all the while calling him his friend.

38:49.400 --> 38:50.240
Send.

38:50.800 --> 38:51.640
Duma,

38:51.720 --> 38:54.200
everyone calls each other friend
in vain around here.

38:54.280 --> 38:56.800
Shall we talk about Akel?

38:56.880 --> 39:00.600
I feel that he is playing
most of the time.

39:00.680 --> 39:02.320
A dirty game

39:02.640 --> 39:06.360
that involves flirting and gossip.

39:06.440 --> 39:07.480
Hashtag...

39:07.560 --> 39:08.720
"...FriendOfConvenience."

39:08.800 --> 39:10.760
I wanted Luma to just say,

39:10.840 --> 39:13.240
"Duma, I thoroughly agree."

39:13.320 --> 39:14.520
Circle, message.

39:14.600 --> 39:15.960
As for his game,

39:16.040 --> 39:18.960
I've been observing him
and had this same impression.

39:19.040 --> 39:21.880
I just see him as someone friendly.

39:21.960 --> 39:22.840
Send.

39:24.800 --> 39:26.720
Couldn't agree more.

39:26.800 --> 39:28.000
Now on to Lorayne.

39:28.080 --> 39:29.960
She's not very close to me.

39:30.040 --> 39:33.080
Maybe she's focused on here alliance
with Akel.

39:33.160 --> 39:34.120
Send.

39:34.400 --> 39:37.280
I'll talk about my gut feeling.

39:37.360 --> 39:39.080
Circle, message.

39:39.560 --> 39:41.880
I don't know if you believe me,

39:41.960 --> 39:44.160
but my instinct

39:44.240 --> 39:46.960
doesn't let me trust her.

39:47.040 --> 39:49.000
Not to mention stories...

39:49.080 --> 39:53.040
"...about gossiping."
We've heard about these stories.

40:02.880 --> 40:04.800
<i>Poor failed guys.</i>

40:05.280 --> 40:06.800
<i>It's crunch time.</i>

40:06.880 --> 40:08.680
ALERT!

40:09.720 --> 40:12.640
"Akel, JP and Lorayne

40:12.720 --> 40:15.880
must go to the At Risk chat."

40:15.960 --> 40:18.120
Hell, I wanted to see that chat right now.

40:18.200 --> 40:19.760
This trio...

40:20.840 --> 40:23.000
really needs to have it out.

40:23.080 --> 40:25.440
Circle, open At Risk chat.

40:26.880 --> 40:28.360
Circle, message.

40:28.440 --> 40:31.280
I think I never wanted
to cry so much in my life.

40:31.520 --> 40:32.360
Send.

40:36.160 --> 40:37.560
Circle, message.

40:37.640 --> 40:38.960
It's in God's hands.

40:39.360 --> 40:42.800
May whoever deserves it the most stay.

40:42.880 --> 40:43.720
Send.

40:45.920 --> 40:48.520
Of course you'd say
something dull like this.

40:48.600 --> 40:49.720
Circle, message.

40:50.440 --> 40:51.480
@JP,

40:51.560 --> 40:54.200
I think this is the best moment

40:54.280 --> 40:57.240
to highlight something
that bothered me a lot.

40:57.320 --> 41:00.280
I don't think it's cool of you to say
that I distanced myself

41:00.720 --> 41:03.840
in order to kick me out of the game.

41:04.320 --> 41:05.480
"#FoulPlay."

41:06.400 --> 41:07.640
What foul play, brother?

41:07.720 --> 41:11.280
I even said this wasn't the main reason.

41:11.360 --> 41:12.680
Circle, message.

41:12.760 --> 41:15.880
Akel, my man, I don't hold
any grudges against you.

41:15.960 --> 41:18.880
Lorayne and I went through every player

41:18.960 --> 41:20.960
and wound up between you and Lucas.

41:21.040 --> 41:22.280
Back then,

41:22.360 --> 41:24.440
I had no reason whatsoever
to block Lucas.

41:24.520 --> 41:25.720
Circle, send.

41:27.200 --> 41:30.320
So, he came up with a reason to block me

41:30.400 --> 41:33.440
saying that I had distanced myself,
although I hadn't.

41:33.520 --> 41:34.960
You don't fool me.

41:36.680 --> 41:38.000
Full of bullshit.

41:38.080 --> 41:39.280
Circle, message.

41:39.800 --> 41:41.920
JP can testify

41:42.000 --> 41:43.960
that I have no strategy.

41:44.040 --> 41:47.000
I played with my reason
and did what I thought was fair.

41:47.080 --> 41:48.800
Period. Send.

41:51.880 --> 41:53.880
Circle, message. @Lolo,

41:54.280 --> 41:57.360
I feel a lot of honesty coming from you.

41:57.440 --> 41:59.840
I believe what you're saying

41:59.920 --> 42:01.840
and I sincerely hope...

42:02.480 --> 42:06.000
"...that getting close to me
wasn't a strategy."

42:06.720 --> 42:09.240
Boy, why would I get close to someone

42:09.320 --> 42:12.040
who always ranked low?

42:12.120 --> 42:14.560
What a chat, man.

42:15.440 --> 42:18.240
Now they're washing
their dirty laundry in public.

42:18.320 --> 42:20.520
The two things that were bothering me

42:20.600 --> 42:23.480
was Lolo perhaps using me as a strategy

42:23.920 --> 42:25.280
and my feud with JP.

42:25.360 --> 42:29.600
Thankfully,
I'm being able to talk it all out.

42:30.000 --> 42:31.440
Circle, message.

42:32.440 --> 42:33.280
Man,

42:33.360 --> 42:37.840
it's so exhausting to constantly entertain
the idea that everyone is being two-faced.

42:37.920 --> 42:40.280
I'm being tested every day here.

42:40.360 --> 42:41.240
Send.

42:44.440 --> 42:47.200
You're here because you want to.
No one is making you stay.

42:47.600 --> 42:49.720
Things really are tough around here.

42:50.440 --> 42:53.000
#FollowYourHeart,

42:53.080 --> 42:54.680
#GoodLuckEveryone.

42:56.480 --> 42:57.600
Circle, send.

43:14.360 --> 43:15.920
Circle, message.

43:16.840 --> 43:18.960
I feel like we've reached common ground.

43:19.040 --> 43:20.960
It's the best thing to do.

43:21.040 --> 43:22.880
Circle, message.

43:22.960 --> 43:25.040
I also think it's the right thing to do.

43:25.120 --> 43:25.960
Send.

43:31.720 --> 43:34.200
ALERT!

43:34.280 --> 43:35.120
"Alert!"

43:35.200 --> 43:36.160
It's time.

43:36.240 --> 43:38.160
It could be our last hug.

43:39.880 --> 43:42.440
"The Influencers have made
their decision."

43:43.880 --> 43:46.680
"All players must go to The Circle Chat."

43:51.320 --> 43:52.680
Circle, message.

43:52.760 --> 43:54.200
As you all can imagine,

43:54.560 --> 43:56.600
it wasn't an easy decision.

43:56.680 --> 43:59.360
"Talking to Dumaresq,
we raised a few points..."

43:59.440 --> 44:01.040
"...and analyzed each player."

44:01.120 --> 44:03.920
And by doing so,
we exchanged information...

44:04.000 --> 44:06.360
"...about manipulation

44:06.440 --> 44:07.760
and gossips..."

44:08.240 --> 44:09.920
"...and we consider this

44:10.000 --> 44:12.080
enough reason for a block."

44:16.000 --> 44:19.320
We know we're dealing with dreams...

44:19.400 --> 44:20.640
"...but that's the game."

44:22.200 --> 44:23.880
I think it's me.

44:23.960 --> 44:27.280
If Dumaresq thinks
I'm trying to manipulate

44:27.360 --> 44:29.920
all the people, then it's me.

44:30.000 --> 44:34.640
If he thought that JP was manipulative,
then it's him.

44:38.280 --> 44:39.880
Circle, message.

44:39.960 --> 44:43.080
The person we decided to block is...
