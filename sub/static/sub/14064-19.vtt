00:00.022 --> 00:01.287
<i>Previously on Boston Legal…</i>

00:01.287 --> 00:03.022
I believe Rachel's using again.

00:03.022 --> 00:04.656
What proof do you have?

00:04.691 --> 00:06.291
She asked to borrow $40.

00:06.292 --> 00:09.492
Crystal meth users live
their lives in $40-increments.

00:09.492 --> 00:12.186
I want you to find out
if my daughter is using drugs again.

00:12.186 --> 00:13.525
What time do you get off work?

00:13.525 --> 00:15.831
She's sweet, beautiful,
nothing rattles her.

00:15.831 --> 00:17.498
Even when she lost her ATM card.

00:17.498 --> 00:18.486
What are you talking about?

00:18.486 --> 00:21.626
Rachel lost her ATM card,
so I loaned her 40 bucks.

00:21.661 --> 00:23.379
You have a child. A child!

00:23.414 --> 00:24.537
You bastard.

00:24.572 --> 00:25.772
I'm helping Melissa,

00:25.806 --> 00:28.849
who seems to have fallen
into a black hole of debt.

00:28.849 --> 00:30.812
Very black.

00:52.495 --> 00:53.732
Melissa Hughes?

00:54.570 --> 00:56.802
Uh, why?

00:56.837 --> 00:59.487
Are you Melissa Hughes?

00:59.799 --> 01:01.265
Alan!

01:01.300 --> 01:04.534
These people are looking
for a Melissa Hughes.

01:04.569 --> 01:06.760
They have guns.

01:06.761 --> 01:07.496
What's going on?

01:07.496 --> 01:09.013
Can we see some identification, please?

01:09.013 --> 01:10.414
Do I have to do that?

01:10.415 --> 01:12.359
Don't I have the right
to not incriminate myself?

01:12.359 --> 01:14.233
Why don't we start with
you identifying yourselves?

01:14.233 --> 01:16.599
Special agent Joseph Reynolds
with the US treasury department.

01:16.599 --> 01:19.464
This is special agent Thomas Leahy,
also with the treasury department.

01:19.464 --> 01:21.650
Are you Melissa Hughes?

01:22.296 --> 01:23.572
All right.

01:23.607 --> 01:25.428
Please put your hands
behind your back, Ms Hughes.

01:25.428 --> 01:25.944
What?

01:25.979 --> 01:27.529
I asked before. I'll do so again.

01:27.529 --> 01:28.549
What is going on?

01:28.564 --> 01:31.047
This woman is under arrest
for evasion of federal income taxes.

01:31.047 --> 01:32.264
You have the right to remain silent.

01:32.264 --> 01:33.947
Anything you say can be used
against you in a court of law.

01:33.947 --> 01:35.250
You have the right to speak
with an attorney.

01:35.250 --> 01:37.308
I'm her attorney.
We'll waive Miranda.

01:37.308 --> 01:39.296
There's no need to take her
into custody.

01:39.296 --> 01:41.415
I'll surrender her myself
at her arraignment.

01:41.415 --> 01:43.870
I'm sorry, sir.
Let's go, ma'am.

01:43.905 --> 01:45.558
Hold up. Did you just
call me “ma'am”?

01:45.558 --> 01:48.080
No talking, Melissa, and don't be
making any statements.

01:48.080 --> 01:50.057
I'll be there as soon as I can.

01:50.092 --> 01:50.964
Alan!

02:25.884 --> 02:28.577
I dreamt I had a 3-way with Denny…

02:29.839 --> 02:32.176
and Denny.

02:32.211 --> 02:34.478
Good Lord!

02:34.513 --> 02:37.284
I wouldn't even want to dream
that you just told me that.

02:37.284 --> 02:39.749
This must be the way
my subconscious is telling me

02:39.749 --> 02:42.144
I need to get back out there
and start dating again.

02:42.144 --> 02:45.784
Oh, well… then allow me to take
advantage of your situation.

02:45.819 --> 02:47.939
My nephew Michael just
moved here from New York.

02:47.939 --> 02:50.025
He is an investment banker
with Price Stearns,

02:50.025 --> 02:52.302
and he needs someone
to show him around.

02:52.302 --> 02:53.316
Shirley, you're my boss.

02:53.316 --> 02:54.721
And you're coming up
for partner soon,

02:54.721 --> 02:57.504
so it's one of those
lose-lose situations.

02:57.539 --> 03:00.407
Fine. Give me his number.

03:00.442 --> 03:03.438
Good morning, Shirley. Denise.

03:03.473 --> 03:05.629
Hi, Denny.

03:05.664 --> 03:09.071
You dreamt we had sex together.

03:09.592 --> 03:11.312
How did you know?

03:12.889 --> 03:14.756
You mean I'm right?

03:15.660 --> 03:19.734
I ask everybody that. You're
the first person who ever said yes.

03:19.769 --> 03:21.875
Uh, Shirley, could we talk for a second?

03:21.875 --> 03:23.132
It's rather important.

03:23.132 --> 03:24.835
Oh, yeah.

03:30.018 --> 03:31.424
Dinner?

03:33.371 --> 03:36.000
Rachel is using again.

03:36.035 --> 03:39.394
I found a crystal meth kit
in her bathroom.

03:39.429 --> 03:41.120
I'm so sorry.

03:41.507 --> 03:44.030
I've decided to do an intervention.

03:44.065 --> 03:47.609
I see no other alternative
but to get her into a facility.

03:47.644 --> 03:48.960
And Fiona?

03:48.995 --> 03:51.213
I'll assume custody
until Rachel is well.

03:51.213 --> 03:52.979
Legally, social services…

03:53.014 --> 03:54.746
I cannot allow for that.

03:54.747 --> 03:57.120
Are you looking for my counsel here, Paul,

03:57.120 --> 04:01.120
or simply informing me?

04:03.689 --> 04:05.978
I guess a little of both.

04:07.839 --> 04:10.928
There's a private investigation company

04:10.963 --> 04:13.344
that specializes in these matters.

04:13.379 --> 04:15.693
I've already contacted them.

04:15.728 --> 04:18.793
You sure this is what you want to do?

04:19.529 --> 04:22.213
There's a child involved.

04:22.248 --> 04:24.862
What choice do I have,

04:24.897 --> 04:28.070
other than going to the police?

04:36.132 --> 04:38.623
I'm not sure I can get you out of this.

04:38.658 --> 04:40.341
Can't you just make one of those
really, really long speeches

04:40.341 --> 04:42.741
like you did with my credit card thingy?

04:42.771 --> 04:46.100
This is a little bit more serious than
not paying your credit card bills.

04:46.100 --> 04:47.384
Oh, come on.

04:47.419 --> 04:50.355
I can't be the first person
to forget to pay her taxes.

04:50.355 --> 04:53.535
You sent the form back
with a note saying “stick it”.

04:53.781 --> 04:58.485
I was extremely close to my grandfather.

04:59.264 --> 05:02.624
I'm sure you feel
you've just explained things.

05:02.897 --> 05:04.949
He served in World War Ⅱ.

05:04.984 --> 05:06.966
He was such a proud American,

05:07.001 --> 05:08.939
and I just started thinking
how embarrassed

05:08.939 --> 05:11.916
he would be by
what's happening today.

05:11.951 --> 05:13.254
What's happening?

05:13.289 --> 05:14.557
Us torturing people,

05:14.558 --> 05:18.331
um, the spying on our own people
squashing everybody's civil liberties.

05:18.331 --> 05:20.246
My grandfather would weep.

05:20.281 --> 05:22.974
It makes me weep.

05:23.009 --> 05:25.420
Melissa, you need
to change the channel.

05:25.455 --> 05:30.157
The awful things you speak of never happen
on the fair and balanced newscast.

05:30.815 --> 05:34.587
41625. The United states vs Melissa Hughes.

05:34.622 --> 05:37.397
Violation of internal revenue code 76…

05:37.432 --> 05:40.568
Alan Shore for Ms Hughes, your honor.
I believe we can waive reading.

05:40.568 --> 05:43.643
And in fact, since the total amount
is around $400,

05:43.678 --> 05:45.526
I would submit that
my client simply pay it

05:45.526 --> 05:47.752
together with late penalties,
and we can dispose of this whole…

05:47.752 --> 05:49.814
The government's not interested
in a deal, your honor.

05:49.814 --> 05:51.977
The defendant didn't just fail
to pay her taxes.

05:51.977 --> 05:54.112
She wrote “stick it” on a post-it

05:54.147 --> 05:56.213
and attached it to her returns.

05:56.248 --> 05:59.320
Your honor, it's quite simple.
When my client filed her taxes,

05:59.320 --> 06:01.741
she inadvertently mailed the post-it note

06:01.741 --> 06:06.537
she had written to herself as a reminder
to stick the check in the mail.

06:06.572 --> 06:08.194
What is this jibber-jabber?

06:08.229 --> 06:11.033
I don't like jibber-jabber
in my courtroom.

06:11.068 --> 06:11.951
Oh, my goodness.

06:11.951 --> 06:15.068
Your client stands accused
of a federal crime.

06:15.069 --> 06:17.106
Do you want a trial, Mr Shore?

06:17.141 --> 06:18.141
Immediately.

06:18.176 --> 06:19.142
Mr Shapiro?

06:19.143 --> 06:20.214
The government stands ready.

06:20.214 --> 06:21.989
10:00 AM tomorrow.

06:22.208 --> 06:27.393
And I would ask counsel to check
his sense of humor at the door.

06:27.428 --> 06:31.991
My courtroom is a temple of decorum,

06:32.026 --> 06:36.554
and I do not tolerate jibber-jabber.

06:41.467 --> 06:43.522
10 o'clock.

06:48.830 --> 06:51.687
It's almost 3 now, so I'd like
to wait until tomorrow.

06:51.687 --> 06:54.359
I want to do this
while Fiona is at school.

06:54.394 --> 06:57.496
How do you know the school
will release Fiona to you?

06:57.496 --> 07:00.941
Rachel authorized me last week
when I picked her up.

07:00.976 --> 07:04.387
Do not expect my daughter
to just go along for the ride.

07:04.422 --> 07:07.784
She will resist you
with everything she's got.

07:07.819 --> 07:08.441
Thank you.

07:08.476 --> 07:09.779
Thank you, sir.

07:13.556 --> 07:15.607
Brad, should the police
come asking questions,

07:15.607 --> 07:19.035
I would count on your support
on the justification issue.

07:19.070 --> 07:23.935
Paul, I'll do what I can, but
I can't really support justification.

07:23.970 --> 07:25.249
I beg your pardon?

07:25.284 --> 07:29.440
Well, what can I tell the police,
that I saw her not taking drugs,

07:29.475 --> 07:33.588
that she took me
to a narcotics anonymous meeting?

07:33.623 --> 07:37.702
I'm counting on your support,
and I will get it.

07:38.192 --> 07:41.843
I did not see a person on drugs.

07:41.878 --> 07:44.166
I'm sorry.

07:47.374 --> 07:48.239
Yes?

07:48.274 --> 07:50.226
<i>Michael Reisz is here.</i>

07:50.227 --> 07:52.286
Um, send him back.

08:00.109 --> 08:03.178
Hi, Michael. Well, it's, um,
it's nice to meet you.

08:03.213 --> 08:05.052
Shirley's told me
so much about you.

08:05.052 --> 08:08.744
Yow. Giggity-giggity.

08:09.429 --> 08:11.473
Beg pardon?

08:16.530 --> 08:19.018
Shirley, when you told me
your nephew was “sweet,”

08:19.018 --> 08:23.394
somehow, in his mind,
that was synonymous with “horny”.

08:23.429 --> 08:25.747
Oh, lovely.

08:25.782 --> 08:27.405
Okay, call me back.

08:41.581 --> 08:42.793
Evening, officer.

08:42.828 --> 08:44.006
Good evening.

08:44.006 --> 08:46.363
License and registration, please.

08:49.142 --> 08:50.464
I missed it.

08:50.499 --> 08:53.763
When did they make a left turn on red
legal in Massachusetts?

08:53.763 --> 08:55.023
Did I do that?

08:55.058 --> 08:58.833
You know, it's been
a really stressful day.

08:58.868 --> 09:02.608
Um, I'm an attorney
at Crane, Poole & Schmidt.

09:03.535 --> 09:05.314
Why are you telling me that?

09:05.349 --> 09:07.881
You think that's gonna
influence me or something?

09:07.881 --> 09:09.047
That doesn't seem right.

09:09.047 --> 09:10.738
I, I didn't…

09:10.739 --> 09:12.120
I'm sorry.

09:12.661 --> 09:14.609
No. I made a mistake.

09:14.644 --> 09:19.151
Officer, why don't you just give me
a ticket and we'll call it a night?

09:19.590 --> 09:22.613
Now that was the right thing to say.

09:23.222 --> 09:26.027
I'm gonna let you off
with a warning this time.

09:26.027 --> 09:28.859
Really? Oh, thank you so much.

09:28.894 --> 09:33.395
This, this is the first good thing
to happen to me all day.

09:33.430 --> 09:36.086
Same here.

09:45.678 --> 09:48.164
We've stipulated as
to your noncompliance.

09:48.164 --> 09:50.954
The only testimony to be taken
would be yours.

09:50.989 --> 09:51.615
Okay.

09:51.616 --> 09:55.152
I'll take one last shot at settling it.

09:55.187 --> 09:58.357
Actually, I've decided I want
to continue with the trial.

09:58.357 --> 09:59.633
Sorry?

09:59.668 --> 10:01.493
I think it's what my grandfather
would want.

10:01.493 --> 10:02.755
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

10:02.755 --> 10:04.697
Please stop talking
about your grandfather.

10:04.697 --> 10:05.894
But…

10:05.929 --> 10:09.241
Melissa, the prosecution is looking
to make a point.

10:09.276 --> 10:13.913
You could go to jail for a long time.

10:15.830 --> 10:18.222
Are you listening to me?

10:20.344 --> 10:21.698
Yeah.

10:21.733 --> 10:25.268
You get to go and fight battles
for things you believe in every day,

10:25.268 --> 10:29.100
and it is so… admirable.

10:29.135 --> 10:31.031
I've never really stood up
for anything.

10:31.031 --> 10:34.309
I know it sounds all stars and stripy,
but my grandfather…

10:34.309 --> 10:37.317
I'm sorry, but he did.

10:37.352 --> 10:40.580
He talked about the America
he fought for.

10:40.615 --> 10:43.329
Now I want to fight for it.

10:43.859 --> 10:48.113
Okay, first of all, and I think
your grandpa would agree with me,

10:48.148 --> 10:52.035
there's nothing more American
than paying your taxes.

10:52.070 --> 10:54.004
I want to have my day in court.

10:54.039 --> 10:57.046
At the risk of having your day in prison?

10:59.918 --> 11:01.819
You want to bone me up?

11:03.343 --> 11:04.344
I beg your pardon?

11:04.344 --> 11:05.277
For my testimony.

11:05.277 --> 11:07.469
Shouldn't you prep me?

11:08.763 --> 11:10.674
You seem prepped.

11:11.940 --> 11:13.828
You okay?

11:15.212 --> 11:17.310
My head hurts.

11:21.146 --> 11:23.188
Let's get to court.

11:40.296 --> 11:41.439
Denise…

11:41.729 --> 11:46.020
I'm, I'm sorry. And for the record,
he's not horny around me.

11:46.055 --> 11:49.754
It's okay. I met someone else,
and the night took a whole other twist.

11:49.754 --> 11:54.597
He's a police officer
and a real gentleman.

11:55.230 --> 11:56.351
You slept with him.

11:56.351 --> 11:56.814
I did not.

11:56.814 --> 11:57.627
You did, too.

11:57.662 --> 11:58.441
I did not.

11:58.442 --> 11:59.001
Denise.

11:59.036 --> 11:59.999
Maybe a little.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.107
You slut.

12:01.142 --> 12:03.367
I have a really good feeling
about this one.

12:03.367 --> 12:07.214
Well, then you can send your
thank-you notes to me and Michael.

12:08.964 --> 12:10.269
This is Denise.

12:10.304 --> 12:11.540
<i>Hi, it's me.</i>

12:11.575 --> 12:16.081
Hey, you. It's him. A next-day caller.

12:18.425 --> 12:19.117
What's up?

12:19.152 --> 12:19.811
<i>Listen, uh,</i>

12:19.811 --> 12:22.212
I was wondering if you could meet me
down at the police station.

12:22.212 --> 12:25.092
Um, sure. I get off
for lunch around noon.

12:25.127 --> 12:28.008
I don't, I don't know
if I can make <i>lunch</i>.

12:28.008 --> 12:29.010
Why not?

12:29.045 --> 12:31.506
<i>I have been arrested.</i>

12:31.507 --> 12:34.191
What? What for?

12:34.226 --> 12:37.333
Impersonating a police officer.

12:43.120 --> 12:46.932
I've always believed the United States
was not only the strongest country,

12:46.932 --> 12:49.824
but also the most moral one.

12:49.859 --> 12:54.087
And so naturally, that's what
prompted you to tell them to stick it?

12:54.122 --> 12:56.386
I just felt so…

12:56.421 --> 12:57.390
embarrassed.

12:58.143 --> 13:00.382
Embarrassed over…

13:00.383 --> 13:04.288
Well, I guess, first, the whole
weapons of mass destruction thing.

13:04.288 --> 13:06.624
Now maybe we lied,
maybe we made a mistake,

13:06.624 --> 13:12.853
but either way, as, as goofs go,
to start a war? Hello.

13:13.118 --> 13:14.439
It embarrassed you?

13:14.474 --> 13:16.077
Didn't it you?

13:16.112 --> 13:17.681
Objection.

13:17.682 --> 13:20.842
Ms Hughes, please do not address the jury.

13:20.877 --> 13:22.761
Okay.

13:23.225 --> 13:25.758
It seems as though
you oppose the war.

13:25.793 --> 13:27.532
Actually, I don't.

13:27.567 --> 13:29.187
If the government had said,

13:29.192 --> 13:31.068
“We need to do anything
to get rid of Saddam,”

13:31.068 --> 13:33.243
I would've said, “let's roll”.

13:33.278 --> 13:35.281
And if we had apologized
after making such

13:35.281 --> 13:37.741
a humongous gaffe
with the whole weapons thingy,

13:37.741 --> 13:39.284
I'm sure I could've accepted that, too.

13:39.284 --> 13:42.692
But instead, we were so arrogant.
It was…

13:42.727 --> 13:44.339
embarrassing.

13:44.374 --> 13:46.401
Yes. Anything else?

13:46.436 --> 13:46.818
Torture.

13:46.818 --> 13:49.158
Our military tortured prisoners.

13:49.193 --> 13:51.639
Aren't we supposed to be the country
that stands for human rights?

13:51.639 --> 13:53.503
I mean, doesn't it just
make you want to hide?

13:53.503 --> 13:54.650
Ms Hughes…

13:54.685 --> 13:55.797
And spying.

13:55.798 --> 13:58.515
Okay, we spy on our own citizens now?

13:58.550 --> 14:01.280
All this to fight terrorists
because they're a threat

14:01.280 --> 14:03.526
to freedom as we know it? I mean…

14:03.561 --> 14:06.029
Talk about burning down
the barn to kill the rats.

14:06.029 --> 14:08.736
Am I the only one embarrassed by this?

14:08.771 --> 14:11.379
What about the military, Ms Hughes?

14:11.414 --> 14:13.952
Have our soldiers embarrassed you?

14:13.987 --> 14:17.527
I have always been as proud
of our troops as I am grateful.

14:17.535 --> 14:21.014
Now I believe you said that
you're actually for the war.

14:21.049 --> 14:22.258
I guess you'd be for winning it.

14:22.258 --> 14:23.129
Of course.

14:23.130 --> 14:25.142
What chance do you think
we'd have of victory

14:25.142 --> 14:27.602
if people started not paying their taxes?

14:28.574 --> 14:29.767
Not good.

14:29.768 --> 14:32.801
But I guess if you're ashamed enough
to be an American, it's okay…

14:32.801 --> 14:36.398
She never said she was “ashamed to be”.
She said she was “embarrassed as”,

14:36.398 --> 14:39.961
a distinction often missed by those
who confuse dissent for disloyalty.

14:39.961 --> 14:41.805
Mr Shore, sit down.

14:42.396 --> 14:43.939
I am sitting.

14:44.908 --> 14:46.073
Okay, you got me.

14:46.108 --> 14:49.888
But I was about to sit after objecting
to the D.A.'s jibber-jabber.

14:49.888 --> 14:50.861
There he goes again.

14:50.861 --> 14:51.766
There I go again.

14:51.766 --> 14:54.966
Stop with the jibber-jabber.

14:55.001 --> 15:00.116
The issue here is, did she pay
her taxes? She didn't.

15:00.151 --> 15:02.204
You be quiet, Mr Shore.

15:02.239 --> 15:06.998
And, Mr Shapiro, sit down
while you're ahead.

15:07.585 --> 15:11.665
We will have closing arguments,
and then the jury will rule,

15:11.700 --> 15:15.313
and then I will give my sentence.

15:15.348 --> 15:16.464
Small point, judge.

15:16.464 --> 15:19.533
You probably shouldn't indicate
to the jury you expect a sentencing.

15:19.533 --> 15:21.130
I could be wrong.

15:21.165 --> 15:22.728
Enough jibber-jabber!

15:41.596 --> 15:43.455
May I come in?

15:55.628 --> 15:59.564
I feel horrible about how
it ended the other day.

15:59.599 --> 16:02.654
Well, gee.

16:03.235 --> 16:05.041
It's just…

16:05.076 --> 16:07.986
if you're using crystal meth…

16:08.021 --> 16:10.360
Rachel, what I know about you,

16:10.395 --> 16:12.664
or, I should say, suspect…

16:12.699 --> 16:16.028
is that you really don't want
to eliminate drugs from your life.

16:16.028 --> 16:17.897
You want to be able
to manage them.

16:17.897 --> 16:19.802
Nice talking to you, dad.

16:20.571 --> 16:23.331
I would like you
to check yourself into rehab.

16:23.342 --> 16:26.043
Fine. I'll think about it.
Thanks for…

16:26.078 --> 16:27.979
You have a daughter.

16:30.151 --> 16:36.542
You know, sometimes being there
is more important than being sober.

16:56.119 --> 16:57.803
What the hell is this?

16:57.838 --> 17:00.191
You're going to rehab, Rachel.

17:00.226 --> 17:01.865
Are you out of your mind?

17:01.900 --> 17:04.018
Ms Lewiston, we're doing this easy,

17:04.053 --> 17:05.563
or we're doing this hard.

17:05.598 --> 17:07.108
Well, let's do it easy, then.

17:07.108 --> 17:08.474
Screw you.

17:08.510 --> 17:09.858
And screw you. What…

17:09.893 --> 17:10.169
Ma'am, ma'am!

17:10.169 --> 17:11.759
Get your hands off of me!

17:11.794 --> 17:13.329
Get your… what are you doing?

17:13.329 --> 17:15.609
This is my house!

17:15.645 --> 17:17.926
What is this, dad?
Daddy, make them stop!

17:17.926 --> 17:19.425
Rachel, I'm only…

17:19.461 --> 17:21.636
Daddy, make them
take their hands off me!

17:21.636 --> 17:24.150
Get off of me!

17:25.603 --> 17:28.000
Get off of me!

17:28.692 --> 17:30.957
Let go! Let go of me!

17:47.140 --> 17:48.592
So…

17:50.302 --> 17:52.848
Have you been doing this
for a long time?

17:52.883 --> 17:55.838
Just a few years.

17:55.873 --> 17:57.894
It's just… you drive around,

17:57.929 --> 18:01.630
and you see people behaving
so irresponsibly, so rudely.

18:01.665 --> 18:04.146
You know, speeding
and cutting people off,

18:04.146 --> 18:07.905
uh, running red lights,
like there are no rules.

18:08.926 --> 18:13.211
One, one time, I just pulled a guy over
and straightened him out.

18:13.246 --> 18:15.457
All I do is warn people.

18:15.492 --> 18:20.644
I just want to help keep the public
safe and, and law-abiding.

18:20.679 --> 18:25.166
So you're like, uh,
hall monitor for the world?

18:25.201 --> 18:30.559
But that has nothing to do
with what happened between us.

18:30.594 --> 18:32.413
That was real.

18:33.247 --> 18:35.240
You're a special person, Denise.

18:35.275 --> 18:40.061
Most women would be put off
with the idea of dating a policeman.

18:40.096 --> 18:43.939
You're not a policeman.

18:44.592 --> 18:48.538
I will be your attorney, but that's all.

18:51.385 --> 18:53.731
That, that's all.

18:55.503 --> 18:58.506
I'll see you in court.

19:20.956 --> 19:23.240
Whatever feelings
you have for me now,

19:23.275 --> 19:24.165
you have to know…

19:24.165 --> 19:25.477
Where's Fiona?

19:26.218 --> 19:28.403
She's with me.
She's doing well.

19:28.438 --> 19:30.245
I want to see her.

19:30.280 --> 19:32.053
I'll bring her.

19:34.655 --> 19:39.795
This person, this Brad Chase,
is he a PI? Does he work for you?

19:39.830 --> 19:42.766
He's a lawyer who works for me.

19:42.801 --> 19:45.787
Well, he's a lawyer in need
of a lawyer. I'm suing him.

19:45.787 --> 19:46.733
On what grounds?

19:46.733 --> 19:50.073
Invasion of privacy,
infliction of emotional distress.

19:50.074 --> 19:52.592
My attorney made a whole list.

19:52.976 --> 19:55.503
You have a lawyer.

19:55.538 --> 19:59.050
Have you moved
for a temporary restraining order?

19:59.085 --> 19:59.918
No.

20:06.836 --> 20:09.584
She's allergic to soy,
and wheat if she has too much.

20:09.584 --> 20:11.599
Make sure to minimize sugar, no soft drinks.

20:11.599 --> 20:14.588
Stay away from the processed foods.
I like to keep it organic.

20:14.588 --> 20:16.111
There's a list of her favorite foods,

20:16.111 --> 20:17.565
her school, her friends for play dates,

20:17.565 --> 20:20.048
her pediatrician, there's numbers for each.

20:20.048 --> 20:22.808
She functions best on routine, so stick to it.

20:25.771 --> 20:27.923
You tell her…

20:27.958 --> 20:31.094
I'm in the hospital, you don't tell why,

20:31.129 --> 20:33.112
and bring her here.

20:33.998 --> 20:36.551
Good-bye, dad.

20:59.817 --> 21:02.713
Melissa, you could very well go to prison.

21:04.247 --> 21:05.600
Yeah.

21:05.635 --> 21:08.688
You'll visit me, right?

21:11.494 --> 21:15.889
You gonna make one of those
really long speeches? They're so hot.

21:15.924 --> 21:19.639
I can stand up and argue
just about any case,

21:19.674 --> 21:23.298
but the long shots, of which
this is one, are different.

21:23.333 --> 21:27.490
Those I need to somehow believe in.

21:27.525 --> 21:32.087
And unfortunately, what I believe here…

21:32.909 --> 21:36.592
is that you broke the law.

21:38.319 --> 21:42.158
Well, then I guess between now
and the time you jump up,

21:42.193 --> 21:45.955
you're gonna have to find
something to believe in.

21:54.460 --> 21:56.263
Why, Alan?

21:56.298 --> 21:59.251
That's all I'm gonna ask. Why?

21:59.286 --> 22:02.428
Some people see things
as they are and ask “why?”

22:02.463 --> 22:07.289
Others see things as they never were
and claim mad cow.

22:07.832 --> 22:10.551
Do you have any idea
what would happen

22:10.586 --> 22:12.710
if all the little people
stopped paying their taxes?

22:12.710 --> 22:14.800
The rich people would have
to start paying theirs.

22:14.800 --> 22:16.616
Exactly.

22:16.651 --> 22:20.785
This is personal.
You're jeopardizing my loopholes.

22:23.705 --> 22:27.187
What's this all about?
Talk to me.

22:27.727 --> 22:31.189
It's about civil disobedience,
Denny. It's about anarchy.

22:31.224 --> 22:33.402
It's about…

22:37.129 --> 22:39.082
The girl.

22:40.100 --> 22:43.635
I have a completely
inexplicable, unwarranted,

22:43.670 --> 22:48.499
small but embarrassing crush on the girl.

22:48.534 --> 22:50.873
That girl?

22:50.908 --> 22:53.212
She's…

22:53.213 --> 22:55.520
fruity chewing gum,

22:55.555 --> 23:00.049
shopping malls
and sexy sweatpants and…

23:00.084 --> 23:02.730
whereas, I'm…

23:02.765 --> 23:04.572
not.

23:04.607 --> 23:06.502
I have no intention
of acting on it,

23:06.502 --> 23:09.640
nor do I regard it as anything more
than a moment's passing fancy.

23:09.640 --> 23:12.076
But as moments go…

23:14.021 --> 23:17.073
My head hurts.

23:20.695 --> 23:23.993
Evidently, she is not challenging
the commitment. I don't know why.

23:23.993 --> 23:25.241
Maybe she can't afford a lawyer.

23:25.241 --> 23:29.038
Oh, she's got a lawyer.
She's suing you.

23:29.073 --> 23:29.134
Me?

23:29.134 --> 23:32.958
I don't really think
she has cause of action or…

23:32.993 --> 23:35.656
Paul, what is she suing me for?

23:35.691 --> 23:39.643
Brad, I apologize for putting you
in the middle of all this.

23:39.678 --> 23:42.838
But, well, as, uh, this plays out,

23:42.873 --> 23:47.536
I would appreciate you protecting
my relationship with her if you can.

23:47.571 --> 23:50.735
What about my relationship with her?

23:51.204 --> 23:53.106
Do you have one?

23:53.729 --> 23:55.507
Well, not really.

23:55.542 --> 23:58.651
I just don't like being
the bad guy here.

23:59.375 --> 24:01.202
Well…

24:01.237 --> 24:06.494
let's just try to repair this,
for everybody's sake.

24:06.529 --> 24:09.035
Especially hers.

24:21.984 --> 24:24.193
I heard a rumor I was being sued.

24:26.511 --> 24:30.157
Your father asked me to find out
if his daughter was using drugs.

24:30.157 --> 24:31.706
I didn't betray anyone's trust

24:31.706 --> 24:34.633
because at the time
that I accepted his request,

24:34.668 --> 24:36.408
I didn't know you.

24:36.443 --> 24:39.324
Now as for the person
I came to know…

24:39.359 --> 24:42.205
A person whose trust you cultivated.

24:42.240 --> 24:44.135
I didn't betray her.

24:44.573 --> 24:46.803
I told your father
that I did not see you using,

24:46.803 --> 24:48.408
I did not see an unfit parent,

24:48.408 --> 24:49.904
and I did not support his intervention.

24:49.904 --> 24:52.886
What a guy. I'm still suing.

24:52.921 --> 24:54.799
No, you're not.

24:54.834 --> 24:58.896
Because any action filed would put
the department of social services on notice,

24:58.896 --> 25:01.955
and right now, everything is private,
which is how you want it.

25:01.955 --> 25:05.140
That's why you're not moving for a TRO.

25:05.175 --> 25:07.888
You're not suing anybody.

25:09.256 --> 25:12.995
I'm not moving for a restraining order
because I belong here.

25:13.030 --> 25:14.398
I'm a drug addict.

25:14.433 --> 25:19.424
I'm staying here because I want to get well
so I can get my daughter back.

25:20.776 --> 25:22.948
You can go now.

25:25.690 --> 25:27.739
Look, I'm sorry that everything…

25:27.774 --> 25:29.747
That makes it all better.

25:32.535 --> 25:36.856
What wasn't a lie was
how much I enjoyed meeting you.

25:36.891 --> 25:41.962
I think… Well, as far as drug addicts go,
you're a really nice person.

25:42.987 --> 25:45.292
Well, that is so sweet.

25:45.327 --> 25:47.598
Can I have 40 bucks?

25:48.412 --> 25:49.720
Drug addict humor.

25:49.755 --> 25:51.359
Very good.

25:51.394 --> 25:54.142
Tell my father to bring Fiona.

26:03.308 --> 26:07.325
Docket number 4175,
commonwealth vs Scott Warner.

26:07.360 --> 26:10.460
One count, impersonating a police officer.

26:10.495 --> 26:13.830
You've heard the charges before you.
How do you plead?

26:13.865 --> 26:15.430
Your honor, not…

26:15.465 --> 26:16.606
Guilty.

26:17.173 --> 26:21.127
Your honor, that's, uh,
not not guilty. That's guilty.

26:21.162 --> 26:21.982
What is going on?

26:21.982 --> 26:25.582
Your honor, if I may have a moment
to confer with my client.

26:26.084 --> 26:26.473
What are you…

26:26.473 --> 26:27.946
Denise, I have to do this.

26:27.946 --> 26:30.562
Sir. I believe in rules.

26:30.597 --> 26:31.179
Scott…

26:31.180 --> 26:34.499
And as much as I hate to admit it,
I broke the rules.

26:34.534 --> 26:37.819
Mr Warner, do you realize
that by pleading guilty

26:37.854 --> 26:39.620
you waive your constitutional rights

26:39.620 --> 26:44.150
and I may impose upon you any sentence,
up to and including the maximum?

26:44.185 --> 26:46.345
I understand completely, your honor.

26:47.076 --> 26:48.287
Fine.

26:48.322 --> 26:51.497
The defendant is remanded
until sentencing.

26:53.266 --> 26:57.739
Well, I guess I'll see you
in a few hours at the hearing.

26:57.774 --> 27:02.212
It's a few hours too many
as far as this fella goes.

27:04.799 --> 27:06.612
I'm such a loser.

27:10.931 --> 27:13.176
Clearly, she committed a crime.

27:13.596 --> 27:15.731
She didn't pay her taxes.

27:16.056 --> 27:20.540
The only question is,
will you hold her accountable?

27:20.575 --> 27:25.758
Now, no doubt Mr Shore will try to paint her
as some kind of activist hero.

27:26.764 --> 27:30.636
But she is no hero, folks.

27:31.488 --> 27:36.677
At a time when freedom has never been
more precarious in this country,

27:36.712 --> 27:41.126
for her to refuse her civic and legal duty
to pay her taxes

27:41.161 --> 27:44.026
while we have soldiers dying over there,

27:44.061 --> 27:47.463
this woman's deliberate action
is as unpatriotic,

27:47.498 --> 27:52.652
as un-American, as it is illegal.

27:53.685 --> 27:57.117
This is the cut-and-run behavior
of a coward.

27:57.557 --> 28:02.778
Don't you dare declare her a hero.

28:23.586 --> 28:29.256
When the weapons of mass destruction thing
turned out not to be true,

28:29.291 --> 28:34.188
I expected the American people to rise up.

28:35.194 --> 28:37.125
Well, they didn't.

28:37.160 --> 28:40.437
Then, when the Abu-Ghraib
torture thing surfaced

28:40.472 --> 28:44.056
and it was revealed that our government
participated in rendition,

28:44.056 --> 28:46.036
a practice where we kidnap people

28:46.049 --> 28:49.721
and turn them over to regimes
who specialize in torture,

28:49.756 --> 28:53.394
I was sure then, the American people
would be heard from.

28:53.429 --> 28:54.749
We stood mute.

28:54.784 --> 28:59.958
Then came the news that we jailed
thousands of so-called terrorist suspects,

28:59.993 --> 29:04.008
locked them up without the right to a trial
or even the right to confront their accusers.

29:04.008 --> 29:07.183
Certainly, we would never
stand for that. We did.

29:07.218 --> 29:13.033
And now it's been discovered
the executive branch has been conducting

29:13.068 --> 29:18.849
massive illegal domestic surveillance
on its own citizens, you and me.

29:18.884 --> 29:21.975
And I at least consoled myself
that finally, finally,

29:21.975 --> 29:25.300
the American people will have had enough.

29:25.528 --> 29:27.287
Evidently, we haven't.

29:27.322 --> 29:31.425
In fact, if the people of this country
have spoken, the message is,

29:31.460 --> 29:33.541
“We're okay with it all”.

29:33.576 --> 29:39.245
Torture, warrantless search
and seizures, illegal wire tappings,

29:39.280 --> 29:42.662
prison without a fair trial, or any trial,

29:42.697 --> 29:45.855
war on false pretenses,

29:45.890 --> 29:48.688
we as a citizenry are
apparently not offended.

29:48.723 --> 29:51.486
There are no demonstrations
on college campuses.

29:51.486 --> 29:56.682
In fact, there's no clear indication
that young people even seem to notice.

29:56.717 --> 29:59.690
Well, Melissa Hughes noticed.

29:59.725 --> 30:03.376
Now you might think,
instead of withholding her taxes,

30:03.411 --> 30:05.913
she could've protested
the old-fashioned way,

30:05.913 --> 30:11.253
made a placard and demonstrated at a
presidential or vice presidential appearance.

30:11.288 --> 30:13.384
But we've lost the right
to that as well.

30:13.384 --> 30:17.515
The secret service can now declare
“free speech zones,”

30:17.550 --> 30:21.647
to contain, control and,
in effect, criminalize protest.

30:21.682 --> 30:25.419
Stop for a second and try to fathom that.

30:25.454 --> 30:30.397
At a presidential rally,
parade or appearance,

30:30.432 --> 30:33.296
if you have on a supportive T-shirt,
you can be there.

30:33.296 --> 30:37.001
If you're wearing or carrying something
in protest, you can be removed.

30:37.001 --> 30:41.746
This in the United States of America.

30:41.781 --> 30:45.605
Is Melissa Hughes
the only one embarrassed?

30:49.311 --> 30:53.871
Mr Shore, that's a chair for witnesses only.

30:53.906 --> 30:57.152
The really long speeches
make me so tired sometimes.

30:57.187 --> 30:58.654
Please get out of the chair.

30:58.654 --> 31:00.301
Actually, I'm sick and tired.

31:00.301 --> 31:01.680
Get out of the chair.

31:01.681 --> 31:06.927
And what I'm most sick and tired of…

31:06.962 --> 31:12.859
is how every time somebody disagrees
with how the government is running things,

31:12.894 --> 31:14.976
he or she is labeled “un-American”.

31:14.976 --> 31:16.043
Evidently, it's speech time.

31:16.043 --> 31:18.340
And speech in this country
is free, you hack.

31:18.340 --> 31:21.714
Free for me, free for you,
free for Melissa Hughes

31:21.749 --> 31:24.212
to stand up to her government
and say, “stick it”.

31:24.212 --> 31:24.859
Objection.

31:24.860 --> 31:27.272
I object to government abusing its power

31:27.307 --> 31:30.061
to squash the constitutional freedoms
of its citizenry.

31:30.061 --> 31:33.376
And God forbid, anybody challenge it,
they're smeared as being a heretic.

31:33.376 --> 31:40.761
Melissa Hughes is an American.

31:40.796 --> 31:47.618
Mr Shore, unless you have anything
new and fresh to say, please sit down.

31:47.653 --> 31:54.279
You've breached the decorum of
my courtroom with all this hooting.

32:00.747 --> 32:06.189
Last night, I went to bed with a book.
Not as much fun as a 29 year old,

32:06.224 --> 32:11.596
but the book contained a speech
by Adlai Stevenson. The year was 1952.

32:11.631 --> 32:17.179
He said, “The tragedy of our day is
the climate of fear in which we live,”

32:17.214 --> 32:19.392
“and fear breeds repression”.

32:19.427 --> 32:22.900
“Too often, sinister threats
to the Bill of Rights,”

32:22.935 --> 32:29.011
“to freedom of the mind, are concealed
under the patriotic cloak of anticommunism”.

32:31.330 --> 32:36.065
Today, it's the cloak of antiterrorism.

32:36.344 --> 32:38.120
Stevenson also remarked,

32:38.155 --> 32:44.008
“It's far easier to fight for principles
than to live up to them”.

32:46.859 --> 32:53.184
I know we are… all afraid.

32:54.124 --> 32:56.963
But the Bill of Rights…

32:57.761 --> 33:00.581
we have to live up to that.

33:00.616 --> 33:02.949
We simply must.

33:04.300 --> 33:07.395
That's all Melissa Hughes
was trying to say.

33:07.430 --> 33:10.304
She was speaking for you.

33:11.092 --> 33:14.782
I would ask you now
to go back to that room

33:14.817 --> 33:17.841
and speak for her.

33:39.807 --> 33:42.248
Before I hand down my sentence,

33:42.283 --> 33:44.653
does the defendant wish
to say anything?

33:44.653 --> 33:48.731
Your honor, while impersonating
an officer is a serious offense,

33:48.766 --> 33:50.777
my client's intentions were sound.

33:50.777 --> 33:52.291
He never harmed anyone,

33:52.326 --> 33:55.295
and he has accepted full responsibility
for what he's done.

33:55.295 --> 33:56.748
He's also very contrite.

33:56.783 --> 33:58.454
Thank you.

33:58.583 --> 34:04.276
I hereby sentence Scott Warner
to 600 hours of community service.

34:04.714 --> 34:06.514
If I may be heard, your honor.

34:07.260 --> 34:07.589
Scott…

34:07.589 --> 34:10.359
If it please the court,
as you well know,

34:10.393 --> 34:16.626
I have already performed 600 hours
of community service while on patrol.

34:16.661 --> 34:18.553
You must feel it yourself, your honor.

34:18.553 --> 34:21.751
Our society, over the past decade,
has become ruder and ruder,

34:21.751 --> 34:25.165
breaking rules, cursing, driving recklessly.

34:25.199 --> 34:28.726
Some are calling it an epidemic.
And I believe, as do experts,

34:28.726 --> 34:33.987
that it is a symptom of the growing
social isolation that we all feel.

34:34.023 --> 34:39.880
Your honor, I'm just one guy out there
asking people to be more courteous.

34:39.916 --> 34:44.514
But what if this were utopia…

34:44.549 --> 34:47.973
and we all did it?

34:48.007 --> 34:50.643
Wouldn't that be something?

34:50.679 --> 34:56.402
I mean, wouldn't that be just great?

34:58.982 --> 35:04.201
Uh, so while I will gladly take
any sentence you see fit as,

35:04.236 --> 35:07.139
as I respect you, your honor,

35:07.174 --> 35:11.423
I would ask you
to reconsider my sentence.

35:11.458 --> 35:13.600
I will.

35:14.666 --> 35:20.308
Three months in prison
and 1,200 hours of community service.

35:24.427 --> 35:27.509
That was a lovely moving speech.

35:27.544 --> 35:29.067
Wait for me?

35:29.102 --> 35:30.590
Absolutely not.

35:30.591 --> 35:32.512
If I were to appeal,
would you handle it?

35:32.512 --> 35:34.144
Absolutely not.

35:34.179 --> 35:36.223
So this is good-bye.

35:36.967 --> 35:38.897
Definitely.

35:39.519 --> 35:41.510
Okay.

35:55.201 --> 35:57.412
That was assault.

35:58.124 --> 36:00.623
Good-bye, Denise.

36:13.762 --> 36:16.443
Will the defendant please rise?

36:16.478 --> 36:20.508
Mr Foreman, the jury has reached
a unanimous verdict?

36:20.543 --> 36:23.260
Yeah, judge, guilty.

36:23.295 --> 36:25.765
Wait till I ask you.

36:25.800 --> 36:28.200
Now what say you?

36:28.235 --> 36:29.556
The suspense is killing me.

36:29.556 --> 36:34.720
We, the jury, find the defendant
Melissa Hughes, guilty as charged.

36:34.755 --> 36:35.316
Right.

36:35.317 --> 36:41.009
Ms Hughes, the jury has found you
guilty of federal income tax evasion.

36:41.044 --> 36:42.898
Permission to be heard
on sentencing, judge.

36:42.898 --> 36:44.214
Stop your hooting.

36:44.249 --> 36:48.020
I'm in no mood for any more
of your jibber-jabber.

36:48.055 --> 36:51.663
The court fines Ms Hughes $1,000

36:51.698 --> 36:56.980
and sentences her to 30 days
in prison, suspended.

36:57.015 --> 36:58.743
Adjourned.

37:00.478 --> 37:02.137
30 days in prison?

37:02.172 --> 37:03.762
Suspended, Melissa.

37:03.797 --> 37:06.950
Jibber-jabber gave you no jail time.

37:10.155 --> 37:11.520
That's good.

37:11.555 --> 37:12.886
It's very good.

37:34.809 --> 37:36.436
Oh, honey.

37:37.149 --> 37:38.851
Are you feeling better?

37:38.886 --> 37:43.311
I'm feeling much better.
Oh, it's so good to see you.

37:44.060 --> 37:45.757
Are you coming home soon?

37:45.792 --> 37:48.552
I'm coming home real soon,
honey. How are you?

37:48.583 --> 37:51.532
Fine. Grandpa gave me ice cream.

37:51.774 --> 37:53.798
Uh, organic.

37:53.833 --> 37:55.325
And grilled cheese.

37:55.360 --> 37:56.818
Uh, whole grain.

37:56.819 --> 37:58.650
And Brad played monkey with me.

37:58.650 --> 38:01.309
Oh. I bet he's a big ape.

38:01.995 --> 38:06.253
Hey, you guys, will you, uh, give me
and Fiona some special time?

38:06.288 --> 38:08.008
Sure.

38:08.043 --> 38:10.158
Thank you.

38:11.072 --> 38:12.675
Wave good-bye to the big ape.

38:12.675 --> 38:15.084
Bye, big ape.

38:21.545 --> 38:23.630
Oh, sweetheart.

38:23.665 --> 38:25.068
Oh, honey.

38:25.103 --> 38:27.521
Here we go. Whoa!?

38:41.458 --> 38:43.091
Thank you.

38:43.909 --> 38:46.124
You're quite welcome.

38:51.733 --> 38:54.884
Maybe we should, um…

38:55.632 --> 38:59.199
celebrate over dinner.

39:00.801 --> 39:03.352
Melissa…

39:03.387 --> 39:05.978
pay your taxes.

39:09.943 --> 39:13.609
That's about as far
as you should go.

39:56.317 --> 39:57.944
She just kissed you?

39:59.490 --> 40:04.748
Is she coming over later to guard you
against night terrors?

40:04.783 --> 40:06.370
No.

40:06.751 --> 40:08.588
I told you I'm not gonna pursue it.

40:08.588 --> 40:10.489
Why not?

40:10.490 --> 40:13.111
Are you depressed because you lost?

40:13.146 --> 40:14.148
I didn't lose.

40:14.183 --> 40:15.764
She was found guilty.

40:15.968 --> 40:19.334
She didn't get any jail time.
That's an empiric victory.

40:20.389 --> 40:23.689
Suddenly you're in favor of emperors.
The truth is out.

40:23.720 --> 40:26.348
That's all he wants to be, Alan.

40:26.383 --> 40:27.578
An emperor.

40:27.613 --> 40:28.773
Damn right.

40:32.351 --> 40:35.802
You know what I miss most
about our country, Denny?

40:37.356 --> 40:44.218
Not the loss of our civil rights so much
as our compassion, our soul, our humility.

40:44.219 --> 40:45.474
No, uh, uh, uh, uh.

40:45.475 --> 40:49.518
Soul, that's a religious thing.
State, church.

40:49.553 --> 40:54.559
It's unconstitutional for the United States
to have a soul.

40:54.594 --> 40:56.538
Apparently.

40:56.919 --> 41:00.976
We seem to be becoming a mean people.

41:01.011 --> 41:04.108
Learned Hand once said,
“Liberty lies in our hearts,”

41:04.108 --> 41:07.171
“and once it dies there,
no Constitution can save it”.

41:07.171 --> 41:12.546
Just once I wish you'd quote a Republican.

41:12.581 --> 41:16.145
I want a kinder and gentler nation.

41:20.359 --> 41:24.674
Nothing quite so optimistic
as a kiss from an idealistic girl.

41:24.709 --> 41:25.687
Who the hell said that?

41:25.687 --> 41:27.260
I did.

41:29.451 --> 41:35.730
It's strange, isn't it how love supersedes
everything that goes wrong?

41:37.167 --> 41:40.185
I still remember the first time Bev…

41:40.220 --> 41:42.649
let me go porkeling.

41:43.069 --> 41:44.883
That's like when you go
snorkeling with your…

41:44.883 --> 41:46.296
I follow.

41:49.699 --> 41:54.144
Sometimes, I close my eyes
and I can still see her there.

41:55.601 --> 41:57.699
Right there.

41:58.857 --> 42:01.248
Love trumps all.

42:03.346 --> 42:05.375
Love…

42:06.828 --> 42:09.882
trumps all.
