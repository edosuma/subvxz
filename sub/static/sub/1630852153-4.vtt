When it's time for an old
building to bite the dust...

00:13.900 --> 00:17.567
Priestly Demolition is
the master of destruction,

00:17.700 --> 00:18.867
led by boss, Ryan.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
- Okay!
- Time is money.

00:21.133 --> 00:22.734
Whoa!

00:22.867 --> 00:25.900
But, for us,
time is a lot of money.

00:26.033 --> 00:28.900
But before they destroy,
they salvage.

00:29.033 --> 00:32.367
You see the stuff people leave.
It blows my mind.

00:32.500 --> 00:35.533
The man leading
the mission is Ted.

00:35.667 --> 00:38.233
It doesn't matter how old
the building is, where it is.

00:38.367 --> 00:40.433
At the end of the day,
I hunt for treasure.

00:40.567 --> 00:42.934
It's Ted and his team's job
to search for anything

00:43.066 --> 00:46.433
left behind before the
wrecking begins.

00:46.567 --> 00:48.767
500 bucks there.
1000 bucks there.

00:48.900 --> 00:50.200
You gotta trust your eye.

00:50.333 --> 00:52.333
With help from
foreman, Justin...

00:52.467 --> 00:53.934
We don't need a
stinking machine, huh.

00:54.066 --> 00:55.400
We got Justin here.

00:55.533 --> 00:57.500
And the boss's
nephew, Julian.

00:57.633 --> 01:01.100
Sweet. One man's junk is
another man's treasure.

01:01.233 --> 01:05.633
But a great salvage
isn't the end of the story.

01:05.767 --> 01:08.100
Back at their salvage yard,
the team's challenge is

01:08.233 --> 01:09.934
to sell as much as they can...

01:10.066 --> 01:11.934
- Good deal.
- As fast as they can.

01:12.066 --> 01:13.767
- 100 bucks for all 4.
- You got a deal.

01:13.900 --> 01:16.467
I asked for unique,
this is definitely unique.

01:16.600 --> 01:18.233
If I know one
thing about salvage,

01:18.367 --> 01:20.367
I'm always
gonna find a buyer.

01:20.500 --> 01:22.166
I will take the
whole package.

01:22.300 --> 01:23.967

help me or what?

- No, I'm not. (laughs)
- You're not gonna...?

we have a new job.

Look how big it is, man.

02:19.767 --> 02:21.834
It's 350,000 square feet.

02:21.967 --> 02:24.567
- That is huge.
- 170 stores. (laughs)

02:24.700 --> 02:26.166
And we gotta get going
because the machines are

02:26.300 --> 02:28.867
right here and they're
moving along fast.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.533
They're not
stopping for salvage.

02:30.667 --> 02:32.400
They'd keep going.
They're moving quick.

02:32.533 --> 02:34.000
We gotta move faster.

02:34.133 --> 02:35.467
What do you
expect to find, man?

02:35.600 --> 02:38.000
It's a mall! All the goodies
in the stores.

02:38.133 --> 02:39.500
It's not complicated.

we own everything

02:44.967 --> 02:46.000
Let's just go down there.

02:46.133 --> 02:47.967
We'll scout fast,
see what we can get, alright?

02:48.100 --> 02:49.266
Okay, man.

Not bad.

Yeah, 'cause
I'll take 'em all.

Real money.

03:40.767 --> 03:41.934
Everything counts, right?

03:42.066 --> 03:43.967
First site walkthrough,
there was definitely a lot of

03:44.100 --> 03:45.633
noticeable salvage items that

03:45.767 --> 03:47.233
Ted would get his fingers into.

03:47.367 --> 03:49.100
This door, Ted,
could you sell that?

03:49.233 --> 03:50.834
That's a nice oak door.

Ted, take a
look at this, man.

04:05.300 --> 04:07.467
- Oh, yeah, the clock.
- The bell's better.

04:07.600 --> 04:09.300
- Clock up top, buddy.
- Clock? What'd you say?

04:09.433 --> 04:11.500
- Clock, buddy.
- Clock?

04:11.633 --> 04:13.934
From 50 feet away you could
tell that was a brass bell.

It's not an antique,
it's not super old,

04:16.233 --> 04:17.133
but it looks old.

- Yeah, you want a mannequin?
- Mannequins are worth money.

04:24.967 --> 04:25.934
Keep it. They sell.

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Ted sees the
value in everything.

04:30.200 --> 04:32.433
It's like he just
sees dollar signs.

rack here, audio rack.

took their clothes and left,

adding up that quick.

What are you thinking, Ted?
Is it worth it here?

04:58.734 --> 05:02.033
I think so. We gotta find
some big-ticket items.

05:02.166 --> 05:04.100
We got a little bit of time
to come through and

Everyone loves
safes and vaults.

Definitely easier
to get in there.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Not as nice as this.

07:17.867 --> 07:19.633
Not as nice as this.

07:19.767 --> 07:22.200
Vaults have been around
for over 2,000 years,

07:22.333 --> 07:24.500
but they're constantly
evolving to try and

07:24.633 --> 07:26.667
keep the crooks out of them.

07:26.800 --> 07:28.667
Modern vaults like this one
are built out of

07:28.800 --> 07:31.233
stainless steel panels
filled with concrete.

07:31.367 --> 07:33.900
They're guaranteed to
withstand a break-in attempt

07:34.033 --> 07:36.567
with drills and torches
for up to 60 minutes,

07:36.700 --> 07:39.900
minimum, so it's put
together like a puzzle.

07:40.033 --> 07:41.567
It's designed to be
assembled and

07:41.700 --> 07:43.567
disassembled on site.

07:43.700 --> 07:45.567
If we can save
this whole vault,

07:45.700 --> 07:47.400
everything else is
just gravy and

07:47.533 --> 07:49.667
we're gonna make
some money here.

07:49.800 --> 07:51.133
Dude, I think
this comes apart.

07:51.266 --> 07:53.934
- Big panels like a freezer.
- I think you're right.

07:54.066 --> 07:55.233
And the walls will be...

07:55.367 --> 07:57.934
it could be like a
concrete core in the wall,

07:58.066 --> 07:59.700
but we don't know that yet.

07:59.834 --> 08:01.166
We're gonna have to
talk about this one.

08:01.300 --> 08:02.400
- Okay.
- Alright?

08:02.533 --> 08:05.100
I think we need a couple guys
in here for a couple days.

08:05.233 --> 08:07.433
Does that work?

08:07.567 --> 08:10.600
If you can spend two hours
and two guys in here

08:10.734 --> 08:13.066
just stripping it,
go from there.

08:13.200 --> 08:14.934
Stripping out the vault
is not a two-hour job.

08:15.066 --> 08:16.266
It's definitely a full day.

08:16.400 --> 08:18.266
I don't mind taking,
taking the time do it,

08:18.400 --> 08:21.233
but I can't risk screwing
my schedule for

08:21.367 --> 08:22.767
the actual demo as well.

08:22.900 --> 08:25.133
I have a schedule to stick
to and every day I go over

08:25.266 --> 08:26.900
it's gonna cost me
thousands of dollars.

08:27.033 --> 08:28.800
I don't know if
the value is here.

08:28.934 --> 08:30.233
So then,
maybe it's not worth it.

08:30.367 --> 08:31.800
If it's not worth it,
we're not doing it.

08:31.934 --> 08:35.934
Like, they're 200 grand new.
We'll probably get 50.

08:36.066 --> 08:38.233
So, if we can sell
this for 50 grand...?

08:38.367 --> 08:39.967
- Pfft, do it.
- It's well worth it.

08:40.100 --> 08:41.600
- Do it.

35:51.400 --> 35:54.767
The plan is to start
with the open vault.

35:54.900 --> 35:56.700
One piece, right,
the whole...?

35:56.834 --> 35:58.300
- The whole frame.
- Yeah.

35:58.433 --> 36:00.934
So, how do we get that out?

36:01.066 --> 36:03.433
Yeah, I think you're just
gotta bend the frame there.

36:03.567 --> 36:05.767

save the inside frame,

36:05.900 --> 36:07.266
and the outside frame.

36:07.400 --> 36:08.800
Why don't we just
take the grinder and

36:08.934 --> 36:12.100
take these welds off, and ply,
just pry this piece off?

36:12.233 --> 36:14.800
- Sure, yeah.
- It's just welded on.

36:14.934 --> 36:17.100

the door loses

36:17.233 --> 36:19.600

so first,

36:19.734 --> 36:22.400
Justin needs to cut
all the weld points.

36:22.533 --> 36:26.333
They're worth 10 to $20,000,
but you can't just grab 'em

36:26.467 --> 36:28.500
with a grapple and
rip 'em out of there.

36:28.633 --> 36:33.667
