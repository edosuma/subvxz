WEBVTT

01:01.562 --> 01:04.281
 He's a Human Tornado

01:04.605 --> 01:08.611
 Mules has kicked me
and didn't bruise my hide

01:08.944 --> 01:10.491
 rattlesnakes has bit me

01:10.821 --> 01:13.495
 they just rolled off and died

01:13.824 --> 01:17.795
 I handcuffed a lion and it
was a raging feat

01:18.120 --> 01:19.997
 I don't want no dilapidated

01:20.330 --> 01:21.530
 sea-slapping pigeon-throated

01:21.623 --> 01:23.023
 cross-eyed
bow-legged son of a gun

01:23.333 --> 01:25.051
 messing with me

01:25.377 --> 01:27.004
 I've been known to rise up

01:27.337 --> 01:29.510
 but I'll cool down later

01:29.840 --> 01:31.888
 I'm a bad motor scooter

01:32.217 --> 01:34.936
 I'm the Human Tornado

01:35.262 --> 01:37.731
 The Human Tornado

01:41.184 --> 01:44.233
 He's a Human Tornado

01:48.650 --> 01:51.278
 He's a Human Tornado

02:00.412 --> 02:03.666
- Ladies and
gentlemen, here he is.

02:03.999 --> 02:06.127
The star Dolemite.

02:09.086 --> 02:11.306
- Yes, I have been rough.

02:11.632 --> 02:13.179
And you know I'm also tough.

02:13.508 --> 02:15.931
I'm bad and sometimes
I get very mad.

02:16.261 --> 02:19.105
I've been known to be mean,

02:19.431 --> 02:21.433
but right now y'all
can look and see

02:21.767 --> 02:23.735
that I'm damn sure clean.

02:32.069 --> 02:36.040
Now I see a lot of lovely
people in this house tonight.

02:36.365 --> 02:38.993
Look at this big fat man.

02:39.326 --> 02:42.671
My my my my girls look
what y'all could get

02:42.996 --> 02:44.339
if you was lucky.

02:46.416 --> 02:48.669
Well I say one thing,
he can lay heavy

02:49.002 --> 02:50.549
but he'll never go deep.

02:58.637 --> 03:01.015
I bet he tells the average girl

03:01.348 --> 03:02.850
you may not know I'm in there,

03:03.183 --> 03:05.231
but you're damn sure
know I'm on there.

03:07.187 --> 03:09.485
I see this big
fat lady with him.

03:09.815 --> 03:11.488
My my my my my,
young lady you've got

03:11.817 --> 03:13.945
the same damn thing them
lil skinny girls got.

03:14.277 --> 03:16.905
But a damn sight more of it.

03:17.239 --> 03:18.491
Is that your husband?

03:18.824 --> 03:19.871
Ain't that a damn shame?

03:20.200 --> 03:22.123
You need a little
skinny man, baby.

03:22.452 --> 03:25.205
You and that man get
in the bed together

03:25.539 --> 03:28.418
and try to do y'all thing
would be a mission impossible.

03:34.256 --> 03:37.385
I'm gonna tell you like the
bathtub told the toilet stool

03:37.718 --> 03:39.766
I get as much ass as you,

03:40.095 --> 03:42.018
but I don't have to
take all that shit.

03:42.347 --> 03:44.645
Young lady went out with her
boyfriend the other night,

03:44.975 --> 03:46.655
and he got into bed
with her and pulled out

03:46.935 --> 03:48.482
something like my little finger.

03:48.812 --> 03:49.904
She looked at it and said,

03:50.230 --> 03:52.699
well you no-screwing,
pencil-dick,

03:53.024 --> 03:54.867
Pistol-Peter son of a gun.

03:55.193 --> 03:57.161
Says I tell you what
I will do for you.

03:57.487 --> 03:59.080
Since you can't
do nothing for me

03:59.406 --> 04:01.204
with a joint that small,

04:01.533 --> 04:04.582
said I'll give you $50
if you can hurt me.

04:05.787 --> 04:07.630
He screwed her three
times and hit her

04:07.956 --> 04:09.674
in the head with a rock.

04:11.626 --> 04:14.129
There's some ugly mother
fuckers in this house tonight.

04:14.463 --> 04:17.216
If you don't believe
it, look over here.

04:17.548 --> 04:18.892
Baby

04:19.676 --> 04:23.772
you are so ugly you stopped
this motion picture from runnin.

04:24.097 --> 04:27.067
Yo lips like you wearing
a turtleneck sweater.

04:27.392 --> 04:28.860
I had a brother
look just like you,

04:29.186 --> 04:30.466
he stuck his head out the window

04:30.687 --> 04:32.405
and his lips beat him to death.

04:33.565 --> 04:35.693
My my my, that's what
I call stretching

04:36.026 --> 04:38.028
a good thing a bit too far.

04:38.361 --> 04:39.954
Two soldiers went to Vietnam,

04:40.280 --> 04:42.954
a black soldier and a white
soldier, can you dig it?

04:43.283 --> 04:44.683
And they come all
the way back home,

04:44.868 --> 04:46.711
and the people in
Louisiana said we gonna

04:47.037 --> 04:48.914
give y'all anything
that y'all want.

04:49.247 --> 04:50.887
They looked at the
white soldier and said,

04:51.208 --> 04:52.328
young man, what do you want?

04:52.375 --> 04:54.252
He said, well I'll tell
you all what I want.

04:54.586 --> 04:58.716
I want me $10,000 and a
Lincoln Continental to drive.

04:59.883 --> 05:01.851
They said, we gonna
get that for you.

05:02.177 --> 05:04.071
Then they looked at the
brother, they said brother,

05:04.095 --> 05:05.096
what would you like?

05:05.430 --> 05:06.898
The brother said, well

05:07.224 --> 05:09.022
y'all can give me
a dollar and a half

05:09.351 --> 05:11.854
from the head of my
ding-a-ling down to my balls.

05:13.104 --> 05:14.606
They said brother, brother,

05:14.940 --> 05:16.863
don't you want no
more than that?

05:17.192 --> 05:19.115
He said, no that's all I want.

05:19.444 --> 05:21.044
So he pulled it out
and they put a dollar

05:21.071 --> 05:22.231
and a half at the head of it.

05:22.405 --> 05:23.883
Then they put another
dollar and a half on it,

05:23.907 --> 05:25.107
and another dollar and a half,

05:25.325 --> 05:26.497
another dollar and a half,

05:26.827 --> 05:28.124
and another dollar and a half.

05:28.453 --> 05:30.296
And one of those fellas
looked at him and said,

05:30.622 --> 05:33.171
nigga, where is your balls at?

05:35.460 --> 05:37.838
He said in Vietnam.

05:44.636 --> 05:46.956
Young lady took her boyfriend
out with her the other night.

05:47.264 --> 05:48.264
You know?

05:48.515 --> 05:50.017
She got into bed with him,

05:50.350 --> 05:53.945
and baby he did his thang before
he could get on top of her.

05:54.271 --> 05:55.739
And he looked at her and said,

05:56.064 --> 05:58.943
go in the kitchen
and fix me some food.

05:59.276 --> 06:01.370
She went in the
kitchen and brought him

06:01.695 --> 06:04.539
a head of lettuce and
a bowl of carrots.

06:04.823 --> 06:05.863
He looked at her and said,

06:06.157 --> 06:07.750
why in the world did
you bring me these

06:08.076 --> 06:10.044
carrots and lettuce out here?

06:10.370 --> 06:12.293
She looked at him,
said, mother fucker

06:12.622 --> 06:14.222
you fuck like a rabbit,
you might as well

06:14.499 --> 06:16.877
eat like one.

06:17.210 --> 06:19.130
- Dolemite you might
come like a rabbit yourself.

06:19.254 --> 06:20.756
- Now this is what
I call a nigga

06:21.089 --> 06:23.057
that always wanna
get in the show.

06:24.843 --> 06:27.517
This is the kinda nigga
that'll fart in a bathtub

06:27.846 --> 06:30.315
and turn around and
bite the bubble.

06:37.439 --> 06:39.988
Ladies and gentlemen
tonight has been a pleasure.

06:40.317 --> 06:41.990
Thank you for letting
us be ourselves.

06:42.319 --> 06:43.741
I ain't lying!

06:44.070 --> 06:46.914
- Dolemite ladies and gentlemen!

07:23.944 --> 07:26.242
- You really came at a bad time.

07:27.322 --> 07:30.075
I'm very very busy.

07:30.408 --> 07:33.378
Relax, take off your thangs,
and I'll see you later.

07:41.211 --> 07:45.057
- I've invited you
all here to inform you

07:45.382 --> 07:47.384
that the money drive
that was planned

07:47.717 --> 07:49.845
six months ago by our
planning committee,

07:50.178 --> 07:52.180
to purchase a new boys home,

07:52.514 --> 07:54.687
has been called abruptly closed.

07:59.604 --> 08:01.277
But along with the bad news,

08:01.606 --> 08:03.825
there's always good news.

08:04.150 --> 08:05.868
I'm going to allow the man

08:06.194 --> 08:07.992
that's caused all
of this to happen.

08:08.321 --> 08:11.120
Your friend and mine,
brother Dolemite.

08:19.582 --> 08:21.255
- Thank you.

08:23.003 --> 08:25.097
I'm so glad you could come.

08:25.422 --> 08:28.596
As you know I've been
having a lot of hard knocks.

08:28.925 --> 08:31.474
And a lot of trials
and tribulations.

08:32.511 --> 08:35.607
And I've had a lot of success.

08:37.100 --> 08:40.104
And I think it's a shame
for anyone successful

08:41.520 --> 08:43.818
not to share it with others.

08:44.733 --> 08:47.077
So today I'm doing
something that I wanted

08:47.402 --> 08:49.325
to do for a long time.

08:50.780 --> 08:53.624
I'm giving my home
and its entirety

08:54.659 --> 08:59.335
to the gentleman that started
the drive for the boys home.

09:02.417 --> 09:05.512
Let us now talk to some of
our distinguished guests.

09:31.613 --> 09:33.786
Alright let's get
this shit over,

09:34.115 --> 09:35.708
I ain't got all day.

09:37.410 --> 09:38.878
- Dolemite.

09:39.245 --> 09:42.749
You're worth every
damn cent I pay you.

09:50.590 --> 09:52.388
- Jethro, stop the car.

09:55.929 --> 09:57.181
- What is it now, Ma?

09:57.514 --> 09:59.234

10:06.356 --> 10:09.075

10:22.038 --> 10:23.038
- Well where we gonna go?

10:23.248 --> 10:24.448

10:31.631 --> 10:35.352
- Alright, alright I

10:38.680 --> 10:40.523
- Wake up Sheriff,

10:42.642 --> 10:43.939
- Put your hands up!

10:44.269 --> 10:45.862
- Don't shoot Sheriff.

10:46.187 --> 10:47.814
It's me, Charlie.

10:48.898 --> 10:51.492
- What in the hell's the
matter with you Charlie?

10:52.902 --> 10:56.998
- Well I'm sorry Sheriff, but
there's been trouble brewing.

10:57.323 --> 10:58.950
- Trouble?

10:59.284 --> 11:00.752
You gotta be wrong Charlie.

11:01.077 --> 11:02.704
We don't allow none
of that around here.

11:03.037 --> 11:04.682
- Yeah, well the one's

11:04.706 --> 11:06.299

11:06.583 --> 11:08.210
They's niggers.

11:08.543 --> 11:09.920
- Niggers?

11:10.253 --> 11:11.253
Where?

- You know that big house

11:13.006 --> 11:14.258

- Ah man, come on Bo.

11:53.046 --> 11:54.639

Looks like trouble coming.

11:56.674 --> 11:58.972
That's the Sheriff's car.

12:02.972 --> 12:05.771
- Ah man I wonder what

12:50.144 --> 12:51.612
- Move, move, move.

12:52.563 --> 12:54.986
Go, go, go.

13:19.465 --> 13:21.467
Who's in charge here boy?

13:21.801 --> 13:22.961
- Sheriff what are you doing?

13:23.219 --> 13:24.971
Now you know we

13:29.183 --> 13:32.357
- Look Sheriff, ain't

13:32.687 --> 13:34.280
Just men, you dig?

13:35.982 --> 13:38.701
- Just say the word Sheriff.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.003
- Well.

Ah!

You know why?

28:11.398 --> 28:12.866
How did we do tonight, Queenie?

28:13.192 --> 28:14.614

28:14.943 --> 28:16.911
In fact you can look for
a bonus with your check.

28:17.237 --> 28:18.534
You deserve it.

28:18.864 --> 28:20.491

28:42.054 --> 28:44.307

28:45.474 --> 28:47.568
- That's okay, lemme
give you a hand okay?

28:47.893 --> 28:48.940
- Alright.

28:51.521 --> 28:53.148

29:05.285 --> 29:08.038
- Everybody freeze!

29:25.097 --> 29:27.771

lady owner?

29:28.100 --> 29:30.523
Well maybe this'll teach you.

29:31.937 --> 29:33.610
The boss wants you to learn.

29:56.837 --> 29:58.009
- Queen!

29:58.338 --> 29:59.590
Oh my God.

30:01.842 --> 30:03.139

30:16.273 --> 30:18.025

30:40.964 --> 30:42.932

30:43.258 --> 30:45.138
Now I want you to close
that joint of yours down

30:45.218 --> 30:47.596

31:41.691 --> 31:42.863
- Yeah, me too.

31:43.193 --> 31:45.366
I wonder why the boss picked
this place to come here.

31:45.695 --> 31:47.117
- He likes the old lady.

31:47.447 --> 31:48.824
Besides, he gets his nuts

31:49.157 --> 31:51.034
watching her torture

31:55.664 --> 31:57.382
- My little pretty.

31:59.292 --> 32:01.920
Oh you like that.

32:03.004 --> 32:05.223
My boy says hey.

32:21.314 --> 32:23.282

Thanks for the use of your car,

32:50.719 --> 32:52.016

32:52.345 --> 32:55.895
- I'll take your money, but you
didn't cause me any trouble.

32:56.224 --> 32:58.647
I've always wanted to
come to California.

32:58.977 --> 33:01.321
By the looks of the
things out here,

33:01.646 --> 33:03.990
someone's gonna have to
kidnap me to take me back.

33:09.112 --> 33:10.785
- Dough, call us a cab.

33:11.239 --> 33:12.991
- Hey taxi!

33:44.147 --> 33:45.899
- Damn, what the
hell happened here?

33:46.233 --> 33:48.110
- Yeah, the club should
be open, shouldn't it?

33:49.152 --> 33:50.574
- Whatever happened,

33:50.904 --> 33:54.158
somebody better have a
damn good excuse for it.

33:54.491 --> 33:57.335
Let's make it out to
Queen Bee's house.

37:20.989 --> 37:22.491

 Midnight in my bedroom

37:48.183 --> 37:50.982
 I feel so romantic but

37:51.311 --> 37:54.315
 my man is nowhere around

37:54.647 --> 37:57.901
 I got the bedroom blues

37:58.234 --> 37:59.577
- Dolemite!

37:59.903 --> 38:01.576
I don't believe it.

38:01.905 --> 38:03.327
On, baby.

38:06.951 --> 38:08.373
- How you been Annie?

38:08.703 --> 38:10.181

without telling me

38:10.205 --> 38:11.377
where you were going?

38:11.706 --> 38:13.866
- Listen Annie, I want you
to meet three of my friends.

38:13.958 --> 38:16.006
This is Dough, Bo, and Jimmy.

38:17.128 --> 38:18.254

38:18.588 --> 38:20.932

38:27.430 --> 38:30.650
- Annie, Queen Bee told
me to come at once.

38:30.975 --> 38:32.852
I went by the club
and it's closed.

38:33.186 --> 38:35.154
- Queen's place closed?

38:35.480 --> 38:37.699
Well that's news to me.

38:38.024 --> 38:39.241
Did you try her house?

38:39.567 --> 38:41.535
- Yes, and nothing.

38:41.861 --> 38:43.033
- That's strange.

38:44.405 --> 38:46.078
I got a hunch.

38:46.407 --> 38:48.080
This is Cavaletti's place.

38:48.409 --> 38:50.912
Getting rich on
niggas and dumb honky.

38:51.871 --> 38:56.126
And I bet you 10-to-1 Queen
and her girls is in there.

38:57.710 --> 39:00.008

a good friend of mine,

40:59.374 --> 41:01.001
Dolemite, Ben.

41:01.334 --> 41:03.211
The best singer the
world has ever known.

41:03.544 --> 41:05.797
- Ben, the pleasure is mine.

41:07.131 --> 41:09.099
- Dolemite.

41:09.425 --> 41:12.019
You know I've heard quite
a bit about you man.

41:12.345 --> 41:13.767
Quite a bit.

41:14.097 --> 41:15.815
- I hope the things
that you've heard

41:16.140 --> 41:17.340
have been good things brother.

41:17.392 --> 41:18.484
- Nothing but.

41:19.727 --> 41:22.105
- Ben, we're looking for Queen.

41:22.438 --> 41:24.190
We understand she's in a jam.

41:24.524 --> 41:25.821
You know where she is?

41:26.150 --> 41:28.152
- You know this job
doesn't pay me to talk.

41:28.486 --> 41:29.487
It pays me to sing.

41:29.821 --> 41:31.164
Annie you know that.

41:32.949 --> 41:33.949
- Give it to me.

41:34.158 --> 41:35.250
 Oh

41:35.576 --> 41:37.203
 Do you mean

41:37.537 --> 41:40.006
 Have I seen the Queen

41:41.582 --> 41:44.005
- Keep your eyes open she's
floating around here somewhere.

41:44.335 --> 41:45.837
I gotta go, I got a show to do.

41:46.170 --> 41:47.672
- Okay, Ben.

41:48.006 --> 41:49.132
- Yeah, that's it.

41:52.510 --> 41:53.978
- There goes Queen now.

41:54.303 --> 41:55.520
Come on let's go talk to her.

42:10.069 --> 42:11.069
- Hi.

42:11.237 --> 42:12.614
- Queen what's happening?

42:12.947 --> 42:15.027
What in the world are you
doing in a joint like this?

42:15.241 --> 42:17.243
- Honey shit done got heavy.

42:17.577 --> 42:19.204
Cavaletti sent some
of his apes down.

42:19.537 --> 42:21.539
Beat me like a dog.

42:21.873 --> 42:24.672
And kidnapped TC and Java.

42:25.001 --> 42:27.675
- Kidnapped em, what you mean?

42:28.004 --> 42:30.473
- Kidnap em, and forced us
to come and work for him.

42:30.798 --> 42:32.678
And said that if I didn't
come and work for him,

42:32.884 --> 42:34.352
he'd kill em.

42:34.677 --> 42:35.974
- Cavaletti must
be nuts to think

42:36.304 --> 42:38.306
he can get away with
some shit like that.

42:38.639 --> 42:40.312
Who the hell does
he think he is?

42:42.143 --> 42:43.941
- That's what I wanna know.

42:44.270 --> 42:45.817
He must think he is

42:46.147 --> 42:48.275
the new Godfather
or some kinda shit.

42:54.113 --> 42:56.457
- He's pissed cause I was
making more money than he was.

42:56.783 --> 42:58.000
Here he come now, look.

42:59.160 --> 43:00.833
- Your ice is melting Queenie.

43:01.162 --> 43:03.085
What's with the chatter?

43:04.165 --> 43:05.963
- They were just
some friends of mine,

43:06.292 --> 43:07.612
and they was looking
for somebody.

43:07.752 --> 43:08.378
- Friends, huh?

43:08.711 --> 43:09.928
Now look sweetie.

43:10.254 --> 43:12.214
Since you work for us, you
can't have any friends.

43:12.256 --> 43:13.382
Now get back to work.

43:16.886 --> 43:18.559
Well folks, I want you to know

43:18.888 --> 43:20.561
the next act is about to start.

43:20.890 --> 43:22.107
I want you to catch it.

43:22.433 --> 43:23.855
You'll love it.

43:45.873 --> 43:47.353
- I'd take care of
you now sweetheart,

43:47.667 --> 43:49.669
but I have other things to do.

44:03.599 --> 44:06.148
But don't worry
I'll be back later.

44:09.230 --> 44:10.402
Yeah.

44:18.739 --> 44:20.992
- Java, what are we gonna do?

44:23.494 --> 44:25.588
- I don't know girl.

44:25.913 --> 44:28.132
But whatever it is,

44:28.457 --> 44:29.925
it's gotta be quick.

44:35.882 --> 44:37.259
This is sick.

44:48.936 --> 44:53.863
- Dolemite, I've been
waiting for you so long.

44:56.485 --> 45:00.035
- Baby, good things
come to those who wait.

45:15.171 --> 45:17.890
- I see you didn't
keep your promise.

45:18.216 --> 45:20.560
Just look at you.

45:20.885 --> 45:23.729
- But baby I've been busy.

45:25.514 --> 45:28.063
- Not too busy to eat I see.

45:32.063 --> 45:35.613
I want to make yourself
real comfortable.

45:37.735 --> 45:41.456
Cause I got something
I want you to do.

45:48.120 --> 45:51.294
 You're soft as the sea

45:51.624 --> 45:54.047
 Filled with satin

45:55.503 --> 45:59.349
 Roll back as a swing

48:47.341 --> 48:49.810
We don't have a thing on him.

48:50.136 --> 48:51.137
- I could tell he's

48:51.470 --> 48:52.722
in these parts.

48:54.473 --> 48:56.521
I'm gonna find that nigger

48:57.435 --> 48:59.813
if it's the last thing I do.

49:00.146 --> 49:01.693
- Well good luck to you.

49:02.022 --> 49:03.820
We'll do everything
we can to help you.

49:06.068 --> 49:07.820
- I appreciate that

49:08.154 --> 49:09.371
very much.

49:10.865 --> 49:12.993
- Oh by the way Sheriff.

49:13.325 --> 49:14.918
What do you want him for?

49:17.163 --> 49:19.461
- He murdered my wife.

49:21.959 --> 49:23.927
- I'm sorry.

49:24.253 --> 49:27.598
I'll put my best man on it.

49:51.030 --> 49:53.374
- Detective Pete Blakeley here.

49:53.699 --> 49:55.701
- Blakeley, it's Ryan.

49:59.538 --> 50:01.506
I've got a special
assignment for you.

50:01.832 --> 50:02.912
- I've got one too captain,

50:03.209 --> 50:04.809
it's just about to
slip through my hands.

50:05.002 --> 50:08.006
Now look, my vacation just
started two hours ago.

50:08.339 --> 50:09.339
- I know Pete.

50:09.465 --> 50:11.058
And I am sorry,

50:11.383 --> 50:12.680
but this is serious.

50:13.010 --> 50:14.307
Maybe a promotion.

50:14.637 --> 50:15.854
- How serious?

50:16.180 --> 50:17.352
- It's a 187.

50:17.681 --> 50:19.934
- Have you got an ID captain?

50:20.267 --> 50:21.267
- Yes.

50:22.311 --> 50:23.904
Male negro

50:24.230 --> 50:26.278
200 pounds, six foot,

50:26.607 --> 50:28.701
may be a scar on
his left shoulder.

50:29.026 --> 50:30.903
We do have a mugshot.

50:31.237 --> 50:32.705
- Oh that's just great.

50:33.030 --> 50:34.998
But do you have a name or an ID?

50:35.324 --> 50:36.871
- Yes, he goes by the name of

50:37.201 --> 50:38.201
Dolemite.

52:09.835 --> 52:12.008
- It looks like nobody can
help him-.

52:12.630 --> 52:14.098
They just wished he was new

52:14.423 --> 52:16.141
and wish he was a girl.

52:19.511 --> 52:21.980
- Well, I think I know
what we got to do.

52:22.306 --> 52:26.982
Queen Bee we got to get TC
and Alice away from Cavaletti.

52:27.311 --> 52:29.439
- Well this is a big city.

52:29.772 --> 52:31.024
Where do we start?

52:31.357 --> 52:32.700
- That's easy.

52:33.025 --> 52:35.323
We find Cavaletti and

52:35.653 --> 52:37.997
make him tell us where they are.

52:38.322 --> 52:40.245
- Oh no, it's not that easy.

52:40.574 --> 52:42.167
Everywhere that Joe goes

52:42.493 --> 52:44.040
he has his army with him.

52:44.370 --> 52:47.465
- Oh baby, armies can
come large or small

52:47.790 --> 52:49.133
but we're known for kicking ass

52:49.458 --> 52:50.926
and we can handle em all.

52:56.298 --> 52:57.390
- Hello?

52:57.716 --> 52:59.559
- Queen, stop what
you're doing this minute.

52:59.885 --> 53:01.478
Cavaletti wants you
and your bitches

53:01.804 --> 53:03.431
over here within the hour.

53:03.764 --> 53:06.017
- Oh just a second please.

53:06.350 --> 53:07.693
This is from Joe.

53:08.018 --> 53:10.487
Pick up on the other phone.

53:22.074 --> 53:24.418
Would you tell Joe

53:24.743 --> 53:27.292
that all the girls
are on their monthly.

53:28.497 --> 53:30.295
And they will not be able

53:30.624 --> 53:32.342
to be over there tonight.

53:32.668 --> 53:35.012
- Now you listen to me Queen.

53:35.337 --> 53:36.384
- What's the matter now?

53:36.714 --> 53:37.714
- She ain't coming.

53:37.965 --> 53:39.317
- What do you mean
she's not coming?

53:39.341 --> 53:40.388
Gimme that phone.

53:40.718 --> 53:42.937
Queen Bee, you better
get your ass over here

53:43.262 --> 53:44.935
and I mean on the double.

53:45.264 --> 53:46.686
- Under one condition.

53:47.015 --> 53:48.608
That you turn my girls loose.

53:48.934 --> 53:51.528
- Look Bee, you're in no
position to bargain with me.

53:51.854 --> 53:53.231
Now you get your
hot ass over here,

53:53.564 --> 53:55.066
or I'll massacre
those black bitches.

53:56.191 --> 53:57.864
I'll give you just one hour.

54:05.159 --> 54:08.504
- Why you rat-soup
eating motherfucker!

54:12.833 --> 54:15.086
- I guess you heard all of that.

54:15.419 --> 54:17.638
- That's all I needed to know.

54:17.963 --> 54:20.011
That the girls are still alive.

54:20.340 --> 54:24.811
Now I can work with that
cranny-dodging motherfucker.

54:25.137 --> 54:26.434
So here's what we do.

54:28.390 --> 54:30.609
- Brother QB what's happening?

54:30.934 --> 54:32.060
- I wanna talk to you man.

54:32.394 --> 54:34.247
- Oh I don't have time
fellas, I got a lot to do.

54:34.271 --> 54:35.271
I'll talk to you later.

54:35.272 --> 54:36.552
- Later on will be too late man,

54:36.648 --> 54:37.649
we need to rap right now.

54:37.983 --> 54:39.735
- That's right brother
man, right now.

54:40.068 --> 54:41.320
- Oh some heavy shit, huh?

54:41.653 --> 54:42.700
- Dig it.

54:43.030 --> 54:45.328
- Okay, sock it to me.

54:45.657 --> 54:48.001
Cavaletti's men blew away
my brother this morning.

54:48.327 --> 54:49.829
- Oh no, you mean Jeff is dead?

54:50.162 --> 54:51.442
- That's why we come to you man.

54:51.455 --> 54:52.581
We need your help.

54:52.915 --> 54:54.517
- Okay I'll tell you
what we'll get together

54:54.541 --> 54:56.964
this afternoon and see what
we can map out, alright?

54:57.294 --> 54:58.563
- Say look here,
I got information

54:58.587 --> 54:59.964
on a house in Pasadena man,

55:00.297 --> 55:02.049
where the motherfuckers
torture people.

55:02.382 --> 55:03.929
- A torture chamber?

55:04.259 --> 55:07.604
Goddamn I haven't heard of
no shit like that in years.

55:07.930 --> 55:09.773
Listen, did you get
any information on

55:10.098 --> 55:11.645
the guys that laid
your brother away?

55:11.975 --> 55:12.521
- Yeah.

55:12.851 --> 55:14.228
The motherfuckers was black.

55:14.561 --> 55:16.359
- Yeah, brothers.

55:16.688 --> 55:19.942
- Mannix, what's new
on the Sheriff case?

55:20.275 --> 55:22.369
- Well I gotta see
some mugshots Chief.

55:22.694 --> 55:23.991
- It's in the Dolemite file,

55:24.321 --> 55:25.948
you've got everything we have.

55:26.281 --> 55:27.841
- The Sheriff's case
is nothing compared

55:28.075 --> 55:29.115
to what I've come up with.

55:29.409 --> 55:30.581
Another 187.

55:30.911 --> 55:32.709
This time the finger points to.

55:33.038 --> 55:34.039
Mr. Cavaletti.

55:34.373 --> 55:36.053
- Cavaletti?
- That's right.

55:36.166 --> 55:37.166
- Do you have grounds?

55:37.251 --> 55:39.424
- Well sir we share some
brotherly information.

55:39.753 --> 55:40.753
- Good.

55:40.963 --> 55:42.403
Gimme the information
and I'll assign

55:42.464 --> 55:43.966
somebody else to the case.

55:44.299 --> 55:46.299
I don't want you biting
off more than you can chew.

55:46.552 --> 55:48.680
You concentrate on
the Sheriff case.

55:49.012 --> 55:50.480
Get Dolemite.

55:51.849 --> 55:53.396
- You mean you're
assigning me to help

55:53.725 --> 55:55.161
some hokey Sheriff
solve a murder case

55:55.185 --> 55:56.903
which we know nothing about?

55:57.229 --> 56:00.233
And for two years, I've
tried to nail Joe Cavaletti.

56:00.566 --> 56:02.694
And finally I get this
asshole by his balls,

56:03.026 --> 56:05.120
and you wanna assign
somebody else to the case?

56:05.445 --> 56:06.445
- Now dammit Pete.

56:06.655 --> 56:08.373
You will do as you're told.

56:08.699 --> 56:09.699
- Good.

56:09.950 --> 56:11.790
I remember the other day
I was told my vacation

56:11.994 --> 56:14.042
started today,
and I'm taking it.

56:17.291 --> 56:19.009
- Son of a bitch.

56:21.211 --> 56:23.634
- What brings you
this way my friend?

56:23.964 --> 56:26.058
- I've got news for ya.

56:30.137 --> 56:31.889
- How you know I'm
looking for needles?

56:32.222 --> 56:33.658
- I heard through the
grapevine that you

56:33.682 --> 56:34.962
were trying to get Queen's girls

56:35.058 --> 56:36.480
back from Cavaletti, right?

56:38.437 --> 56:39.905
- So?

56:40.397 --> 56:43.276
- I got some real strong info
from some friends of mine.

56:54.494 --> 56:56.462
- So let's have it.

56:56.788 --> 56:58.586
- Info like that
don't grow on trees.

56:58.916 --> 57:00.884
It costs money you know.

57:01.209 --> 57:03.303
I got a sick aunt.

57:15.641 --> 57:16.688
- Hold it.

57:18.602 --> 57:20.275
Information first.

57:20.604 --> 57:23.824
- Well Cavaletti's got
this house in Pasadena.

57:24.149 --> 57:25.901
It's a real chamber of horrors.

57:26.234 --> 57:28.532
Like he really fucks
people up over there man.

57:28.862 --> 57:30.910
- Where's it at?

57:31.239 --> 57:32.866
- I haven't found that out yet.

57:33.200 --> 57:35.123
- Well how do you find out?

57:36.119 --> 57:38.998
- If somebody was to get
Cavaletti's main woman,

57:39.331 --> 57:41.959
then they might find
out where the house is.

57:42.292 --> 57:44.715
- Where does Cavaletti
keep his main woman?

57:45.879 --> 57:47.005
- Well

57:48.048 --> 57:51.302
Cavaletti usually
keeps her at his pad.

57:51.635 --> 57:53.308
She's a nice bitch.

57:53.637 --> 57:56.311
I heard that she's a
common freak, you know?

57:56.640 --> 57:58.233
A real nymphomaniac.

57:58.558 --> 58:00.560
- Where's Cavaletti's house?

58:00.894 --> 58:03.147
- In Pasadena baby.

58:11.238 --> 58:12.660
- May I help you?

58:12.990 --> 58:16.244
- Yes, is this the
Cavaletti's residence?

58:16.576 --> 58:17.702
- Yes, it is.

58:18.036 --> 58:19.036
What can I do for you?

58:19.329 --> 58:21.423
- My card first, Madame.

58:25.585 --> 58:28.885
- Frank Huck
Delmonico NcAdeemus?

58:29.214 --> 58:30.214
- Yes.

58:30.257 --> 58:32.055
Are you Mrs. Cavaletti?

58:32.384 --> 58:33.556
- Yes, I am.

58:33.885 --> 58:35.137
- Mrs. Cavaletti

58:35.470 --> 58:38.519
I am a connoisseur of the rarest

58:38.849 --> 58:41.068
most interesting nude studies.

58:41.393 --> 58:42.485
- I am not interested.

58:42.811 --> 58:43.811
If you'll just...

58:44.104 --> 58:46.857
- Ms-Cavaletti, if you
would wait just a moment

58:47.190 --> 58:49.739
and gaze upon this
exquisite artwork,

58:50.068 --> 58:52.241
I'm sure you'll be interested.

58:55.407 --> 58:57.330
Madame.

58:57.659 --> 59:00.037
I see you like my work.

59:00.370 --> 59:01.963
Miss?

59:02.289 --> 59:03.711
Miss Cavaletti?

59:05.876 --> 59:08.174
Mrs. Cavaletti?

59:08.503 --> 59:10.426
You do like my work?

59:11.465 --> 59:13.843
I've got something
better for you.

59:17.137 --> 59:19.105
You'll like it.

59:19.431 --> 59:22.355
Big black strong man.

59:24.061 --> 59:27.031
Ah. Ah.

59:28.148 --> 59:30.025
You'll enjoy it.

59:30.358 --> 59:33.077
Miss Cavaletti, Miss Cavaletti?

01:01:21.261 --> 01:01:25.266
- Where is Cavaletti
hiding my girls?

01:01:28.935 --> 01:01:31.609
- Where is Cavaletti
hiding my girls?

01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:38.495
- Where is Cavaletti
hiding my girls?

01:01:40.822 --> 01:01:43.245
- Where is Cavaletti
hiding my girls?

01:01:44.326 --> 01:01:47.421
- Where is Cavaletti
hiding my girls?

01:01:47.996 --> 01:01:50.624
Where, where is Cavaletti
hiding the girls!

01:02:52.102 --> 01:02:53.729
Where is Cavaletti
hiding my girls?

01:02:54.145 --> 01:02:55.692
Where is Cavaletti
hiding my girls?

01:02:56.022 --> 01:02:57.382
Where is Cavaletti
hiding my girls?

01:02:57.607 --> 01:02:59.325
Where is Cavaletti
hiding my girls?

01:02:59.651 --> 01:03:01.119
Where is Cavaletti
hiding my girls?

01:03:01.444 --> 01:03:03.196
Where is Cavaletti
hiding my girls?

01:03:04.239 --> 01:03:07.083
Where is Cavaletti
hiding my girls?

01:03:08.034 --> 01:03:10.913
- They're at the
house on the hill

01:03:11.246 --> 01:03:13.044
in Pasadena.

01:03:13.373 --> 01:03:15.922
They're at the house on the hill

01:03:16.251 --> 01:03:17.969
in Pasadena.

01:03:18.295 --> 01:03:21.014
They're at house on the hill

01:03:21.339 --> 01:03:23.091
in Pasadena!

01:03:27.012 --> 01:03:28.639
They're at the house

01:03:28.972 --> 01:03:31.896
on the hill in Pasadena.

01:03:32.225 --> 01:03:32.851
- Have a seat.

01:03:33.184 --> 01:03:34.184
- No thanks.

01:03:34.311 --> 01:03:35.311
- Some coffee?

01:03:35.353 --> 01:03:36.713
- No thanks, I've
had my breakfast.

01:03:36.896 --> 01:03:38.016
I just came here to find out

01:03:38.231 --> 01:03:39.858
what you got on
that Dolemite boy.

01:03:40.191 --> 01:03:41.911
It's been a while since
I've heard from you.

01:03:42.193 --> 01:03:44.070
I wanna know what's happening.

01:03:44.404 --> 01:03:46.156
- Well when we get something,

01:03:46.489 --> 01:03:48.036
I'll let you know.

01:03:49.159 --> 01:03:51.036
I've got my best
man on the case.

01:03:51.369 --> 01:03:53.667
- He ain't made no
contact with me yet.

01:03:53.997 --> 01:03:57.092
- Well this particular man
works better by himself.

01:03:57.417 --> 01:04:00.045
He's my undercover
man for the ghettos.

01:04:00.378 --> 01:04:01.721
- You mean to tell me you sent

01:04:02.047 --> 01:04:04.721
a nigger out to
find another nigger?

01:04:05.050 --> 01:04:06.450
Why that's the most
ridiculous thing

01:04:06.634 --> 01:04:08.011
I've ever heard of.

01:04:08.303 --> 01:04:09.303
- Sheriff.

01:04:09.304 --> 01:04:11.398
We don't have any niggers here.

01:04:11.723 --> 01:04:13.942
Just damn fine police officers.

01:04:14.267 --> 01:04:15.985
Some of the best in the country.

01:04:16.311 --> 01:04:18.530
Now if you can't respect that,

01:04:18.855 --> 01:04:21.278
and if you can't accept
my choice of assignment,

01:04:21.608 --> 01:04:24.236
you can get your
ass out that door.

01:04:24.569 --> 01:04:26.913
And if you don't like that
you can go to the Chief.

01:04:27.238 --> 01:04:29.491
- I'll do just that Captain.

01:04:29.824 --> 01:04:32.418
And when I find him, I'll
bring his head to you.

01:04:32.744 --> 01:04:34.838
Since you love niggers so much.

01:04:35.163 --> 01:04:38.633
You can mount Dolemite's
head on your mantlepiece.

01:04:38.958 --> 01:04:41.381
Good day, Captain.

01:04:43.963 --> 01:04:45.556
- Fuck you.

01:04:49.177 --> 01:04:50.804
- Sweetheart.

01:04:51.137 --> 01:04:52.309
Call Queen.

01:04:52.639 --> 01:04:54.439
Tell her to bring everybody
that works for her

01:04:54.516 --> 01:04:55.516
to my party tonight.

01:04:55.767 --> 01:04:57.007
Tell them to be ready at eight.

01:04:57.143 --> 01:04:59.145
I'll have them picked up.

01:05:03.191 --> 01:05:04.283
- Hello?

01:05:04.609 --> 01:05:06.649
- Joe wants you to scrounge
up all the girls you can

01:05:06.903 --> 01:05:08.325
and bring em over here tonight.

01:05:08.655 --> 01:05:10.953
We'll send someone after you.

01:05:11.282 --> 01:05:13.376
- Yes ma'am, we'll be there.

01:05:15.161 --> 01:05:16.538
- Well.

01:05:17.539 --> 01:05:20.634
Looks like we've all been
invited to the party.

01:05:20.959 --> 01:05:22.506
But this time

01:05:22.836 --> 01:05:24.804
this will be the party
to end all parties.

01:05:36.099 --> 01:05:37.521
Okay.

01:05:37.851 --> 01:05:41.151
We know that Cavaletti has
an army compared to us.

01:05:42.147 --> 01:05:43.899
We're outnumbered in people

01:05:44.232 --> 01:05:46.155
but not in skill.

01:05:47.152 --> 01:05:49.826
Just remember

01:05:50.155 --> 01:05:52.123
if anybody come out alive

01:05:52.449 --> 01:05:54.451
be sure it be one of us.

01:05:54.784 --> 01:05:56.832
Now how did you say this worked?

01:05:57.162 --> 01:05:58.414
- Well tonight

01:05:58.746 --> 01:06:01.090
is Cavaletti's birthday party.

01:06:02.542 --> 01:06:06.422
You'll have all his
big shit friends there.

01:06:07.922 --> 01:06:10.016
- So if we get em
all at one time,

01:06:10.341 --> 01:06:12.093
it's got to be tonight.

01:06:13.678 --> 01:06:16.101
- Has anybody heard
from Dolemite?

01:06:30.278 --> 01:06:32.246
- Howard Jackson!

01:06:36.117 --> 01:06:40.247
- Is that the bad little nigga
that taught me martial arts?

01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:42.048
- In person.

01:06:42.373 --> 01:06:44.046
- Lord things is looking better.

01:06:44.375 --> 01:06:45.375
- Looking better?

01:06:45.668 --> 01:06:46.885
With that little shit?

01:06:47.212 --> 01:06:49.761
Well I'll take my dick and
beat his goddamn ass with that.

01:06:52.217 --> 01:06:54.060
- We'll see about that brother.

01:06:56.846 --> 01:06:58.598
- Did you hear about
the new contract?

01:06:58.932 --> 01:06:59.933
- No, what is it?

01:07:00.266 --> 01:07:02.815
- It's Queen Bee,
Annie, and Dolemite.

01:07:03.144 --> 01:07:04.145
- Who's doing the job?

01:07:04.479 --> 01:07:05.479
- Red and Fingers.

01:07:05.647 --> 01:07:06.273
- Well that's Wild.

01:07:06.606 --> 01:07:07.886
With those three out of the way,

01:07:07.941 --> 01:07:08.533
the boss will have no problems.

01:07:08.858 --> 01:07:09.858
- Right.

01:07:19.452 --> 01:07:21.580
- Okay, we'll be right out.

01:07:24.207 --> 01:07:25.675
Alright girls.

01:07:25.959 --> 01:07:28.007
Let's get this show on the road.

01:07:42.225 --> 01:07:43.852
- We'll see you there.

01:07:44.185 --> 01:07:45.903
- We'll wait till
the party starts

01:07:46.229 --> 01:07:48.027
then we'll crash it.

01:10:52.832 --> 01:10:55.255
- You should have stayed
down there the first time!

01:11:13.352 --> 01:11:15.195
- I didn't forget about you.

01:11:17.690 --> 01:11:19.863
We'll make it a twosome.

01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:34.923
Now don't move

01:11:35.249 --> 01:11:36.375

01:12:37.395 --> 01:12:39.443
- No, no.

01:12:41.065 --> 01:12:42.908
Please don't kill us.

01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:15.934
Please don't kill us, please!

01:13:16.267 --> 01:13:18.065
Please no!

01:13:39.749 --> 01:13:42.002
- The candle over here!

01:13:42.335 --> 01:13:45.009
The candle, the
rope, for God's sake!

01:13:45.338 --> 01:13:47.511
Pull me out of the way Dolemite.

01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:48.840

01:13:59.685 --> 01:14:01.983
- Don't touch me there's a
live grenade between my legs.

01:14:02.313 --> 01:14:04.065
- Be very careful
don't move, don't move.

01:14:04.398 --> 01:14:07.618
- He keeps the key over
in his back pocket.

01:14:39.767 --> 01:14:42.691
- Java, are you alright?

01:14:47.858 --> 01:14:51.658
Mules have kicked me and
didn't even bruise my hide.

01:14:53.072 --> 01:14:56.417
Rattlesnakes have bit me
and falled off and died.

01:14:57.827 --> 01:15:02.048
Yes, I fought my way in here

Yeah, it's Pete here.

01:15:43.497 --> 01:15:44.669
Yeah, I know about that.

01:15:44.999 --> 01:15:46.216
Listen, hold onto your hat

01:15:46.542 --> 01:15:48.222
and get a pencil and
pad to take this down.

01:15:48.544 --> 01:15:51.013
I got some news here to

01:15:51.338 --> 01:15:52.338

01:15:52.339 --> 01:15:55.058

01:15:58.137 --> 01:16:00.856
That's right, Dolemite is

01:16:01.182 --> 01:16:02.900
There's a war going

01:17:24.515 --> 01:17:26.893

01:17:28.978 --> 01:17:30.525
Come out here and you can see

01:17:30.855 --> 01:17:34.576
some genuine American
Indian turquoise jewelry.

01:17:34.900 --> 01:17:36.868

I'm selling this shit cheap.

01:17:42.449 --> 01:17:44.409
I'm gonna let you take the
shit off your old lady.

01:17:44.451 --> 01:17:45.931
She might give you
some pussy tonight,

01:17:46.162 --> 01:17:47.459
if you know what to do with it.

01:17:47.788 --> 01:17:50.337
Wait a minute fool,

01:18:03.137 --> 01:18:04.764
- Hey everybody.

01:18:05.097 --> 01:18:06.644
Got a special surprise for you.

01:18:06.974 --> 01:18:09.648
Cavaletti just hired a new
man, and he's one of the boys.

01:18:10.603 --> 01:18:12.105
And for this evening's
entertainment,

01:18:12.438 --> 01:18:13.678
he's going to demonstrate to us

01:18:13.981 --> 01:18:17.406
how he became Central America's
champ at nunchuck sticks.

01:18:51.018 --> 01:18:53.612
- Catering service here sir.

01:19:02.947 --> 01:19:06.042
Where do you want this stuff?

01:19:13.874 --> 01:19:16.753
Looks like you're having
a real nice party.

01:19:18.837 --> 01:19:19.884
- Sure am.

01:19:20.214 --> 01:19:21.716
Put the stuff in the kitchen.

01:19:22.049 --> 01:19:23.346
Too bad you wasn't invited boy.

01:19:23.676 --> 01:19:24.768
- Yeah it is.

01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:30.149
- Say baby, let's you

01:19:33.143 --> 01:19:35.237
- I don't have a suit on sugar.

01:19:35.562 --> 01:19:37.439
- Suit? It's a private pool.

01:19:41.235 --> 01:19:45.490
- In that case, what
are we waiting for?

01:19:49.660 --> 01:19:51.980
- Say the young lady that was
with the guy with the glasses

01:19:52.288 --> 01:19:53.585
is she a friend of yours?

01:19:53.914 --> 01:19:55.712
- Oh yes, she's one of my girls.

01:20:37.499 --> 01:20:38.876
- Hey there Momma, what it is?

01:20:39.209 --> 01:20:39.584

01:20:39.918 --> 01:20:41.215
- You got Red.

01:20:42.254 --> 01:20:45.224
I can't believe it.

01:20:45.549 --> 01:20:48.098
Now I have to kill
both of ya's myself.

01:20:48.427 --> 01:20:50.020
Alright ladies this way.

01:20:50.346 --> 01:20:51.768
Come on, move!

01:20:54.099 --> 01:20:56.101
That's far enough.

01:21:00.481 --> 01:21:02.108
Turn around!

01:21:19.208 --> 01:21:22.508
- Wait a minute little

01:27:25.782 --> 01:27:27.250
- Jimmy...

01:27:27.576 --> 01:27:28.919
Jimmy.

01:27:32.122 --> 01:27:33.975
- Pack your things, we're
getting out of here fast.

01:27:33.999 --> 01:27:34.591
- What's the matter honey?

01:27:34.916 --> 01:27:36.018

01:27:39.045 --> 01:27:40.547
- Can you hear me?

01:27:40.881 --> 01:27:42.007
It's your brother Bo.

01:27:45.427 --> 01:27:47.475

01:28:08.033 --> 01:28:09.033

01:28:10.494 --> 01:28:12.371
- He's just playing.

01:28:14.122 --> 01:28:16.124
He's just playing.

01:28:16.458 --> 01:28:18.460
Come on stop acting man, get up.

01:28:20.504 --> 01:28:21.676

01:28:54.162 --> 01:28:56.005
- Let me go!

01:29:12.931 --> 01:29:15.025
- Hold it everyone!

01:29:17.018 --> 01:29:18.018
- Police!

01:29:18.186 --> 01:29:21.190
- Freeze everybody, freeze!

01:29:21.523 --> 01:29:23.696

01:29:34.828 --> 01:29:36.250
Come here.

01:29:36.580 --> 01:29:38.002
Where's Cavaletti?

01:29:38.331 --> 01:29:40.425
Where is he?

01:29:44.963 --> 01:29:47.136
- Hold it, out, out.

01:29:48.842 --> 01:29:51.061

bitch named Dolemite?

01:32:15.947 --> 01:32:17.699

01:32:18.033 --> 01:32:20.127

01:32:50.732 --> 01:32:52.780
