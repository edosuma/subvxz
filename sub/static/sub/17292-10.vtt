<i>Previously on </i>Crazy Ex-Girlfriend...

00:02.836 --> 00:05.755
This is Nathaniel Plimpton,
the new co-owner of the firm.

00:05.839 --> 00:07.924
We're gonna start running this place
like a real business.

00:08.008 --> 00:10.593
My father and our firm
demand nothing less.

00:10.677 --> 00:12.929
You moved here for Josh Chan?
Of course, you would do something

00:13.012 --> 00:14.681
like give up your wonderful life
in New York

00:14.764 --> 00:16.641
to be near that... that loser.

00:16.725 --> 00:19.477
I know I hurt you,
and I don't blame you for not trusting me,

00:19.561 --> 00:21.271
but I promise you,
it'll be different this time.

00:21.354 --> 00:23.356
<i>We'll start over.</i>
<i>Do things the right way.</i>

00:23.440 --> 00:24.524
<i>Rebecca, I love you.</i>

00:25.275 --> 00:27.402
You love me? You mean
you love something about me.

00:27.485 --> 00:31.990
-No, you. I love you.
-Oh, my God, I love you too, Josh Chan.

Wait, my cousin Skyler?
Why is he following you?

01:30.006 --> 01:31.925
We're going to his bar mitzvah
this weekend.

01:32.008 --> 01:34.969
I friended practically his whole class
at Scarsdale Middle School.

01:35.053 --> 01:37.889
Jonah Leibowitz is playing hard to get,
but I'll get him.

01:39.307 --> 01:40.600
Oh...

01:40.683 --> 01:42.769
You know, normally,
I wouldn't look forward

01:42.852 --> 01:44.437
to going to a family bar mitzvah,

01:44.521 --> 01:48.441
but now that you'll be there, it's just
gonna be different and "supes awes."

[both laughing]

02:00.036 --> 02:03.373
You know, studies have shown that couples
who post a lot on social media

02:03.456 --> 02:05.625
are often insecure about their attachment.

02:05.708 --> 02:07.210
Heather, did you just look that up?

02:07.293 --> 02:08.878
No, I actually started with a hypothesis,

02:08.962 --> 02:10.713
and then I backed it up
with a <i>Vox</i> article.

02:10.797 --> 02:12.257
It's standard scientific method.

02:12.340 --> 02:13.716
Okay, well, you're way off

02:13.800 --> 02:16.678
because Josh and I just want
to show the world our happiness.

02:16.761 --> 02:18.972
And maybe once they see
our happiness, it'll spread,

02:19.055 --> 02:20.765
and then there will be no more war.

02:20.849 --> 02:23.393
Mwah! That's right, baby.
That's how peace happens.

02:23.476 --> 02:26.479
Yeah, love fixes everything.
[giggles]

02:26.563 --> 02:30.400
-I just don't think that's realistic.
-[both] Just shut up, Heather!

02:30.483 --> 02:31.943
Okay? You don't know
what you're talking about.

"irregular, 30 percent off,
the Suit Barn."

05:20.028 --> 05:21.154

No, doofus.

Hey, there. Wow, you have
the most intense look on your face.

05:40.381 --> 05:42.633
I'm excited for your other looks,
whenever those get going.

05:45.303 --> 05:48.473
Wow, so you found
Rebecca's treadmill desk.

05:48.556 --> 05:51.350
Yes, took maintenance a while
to get out the hot dog smell.

05:51.434 --> 05:54.395
Well, you know Rebecca.
She loves to jog and dog.

05:54.479 --> 05:58.357
-Darryl, what can I do for you?
-The question is, "What can <i>I</i> do for <i>you</i>?"

05:58.441 --> 06:00.526
Because I get it.
You're now the number one.

06:00.610 --> 06:04.864
I'm the number two, dangling under you,
ready to drop in, make a splash.

06:04.947 --> 06:06.449
Darryl, stop.

06:06.532 --> 06:10.369
So, you're not craving a number two?
There's no rumblings for a deuce?

06:10.453 --> 06:11.788
No.

06:12.872 --> 06:16.292
Cool, cool. Well, I'm not gonna push it.
I'm just gonna go back one out.

06:16.375 --> 06:19.253
I mean, I'm just gonna back out.

06:23.800 --> 06:24.884
[candy clattering]

06:27.804 --> 06:28.638
Uh-oh.

06:29.847 --> 06:33.017
You're not even separating out
the buttered popcorn flavored ones.

06:33.976 --> 06:37.188
-Didn't go well, huh?
-What? No, it went great.

06:37.271 --> 06:40.149
Yeah, I mean, he doesn't have a lot
for me now, but I know he will soon.

06:40.233 --> 06:43.861
Absolutely. It's all gonna change
once he gets that big client.

06:43.945 --> 06:46.781
That what? What client?

06:46.864 --> 06:49.283
You know, that huge client
that he used to rep in the LA office,

06:49.367 --> 06:51.327
and his dad said he could
also represent them here.

06:52.411 --> 06:58.459
Oh, oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah. The big client.
True. I thought you said the "pig" client.

06:58.543 --> 07:03.005
You don't know about them?
The pork-processing place out in Duarte?

07:03.089 --> 07:05.842
Oh, you've gotta check that out.
But you said the "big" client.

07:05.925 --> 07:09.137
That's the one... That's the one that has
the weird name that's hard to pronounce.

07:09.220 --> 07:11.848
How do-- How do you say it?
Just off the top of your head.

07:11.931 --> 07:15.017
-Say it. Just say it.
-Peterson Car Sales?

07:15.101 --> 07:17.937
Mm, close, but it's actually "Petterson."

07:18.020 --> 07:21.482
It's Petterson Car Sales, yeah.
That's the correct pronunciation.

07:21.566 --> 07:25.611
Anyway, over and out.
I've got a lot of work to do.

07:31.826 --> 07:34.704
Oh! You found my old hot dog cooker.

07:35.413 --> 07:38.040
Pop the cover off, set it to 3.4 MPH,

07:38.124 --> 07:39.959
slide some Ball Park fatties
on those rollers--

07:40.042 --> 07:43.379
-Cooks up real nice.
-[exhales]

07:43.463 --> 07:45.506
Yeah. What are you doing to yourself?

07:45.590 --> 07:47.175
High interval impact training.

07:47.258 --> 07:50.845
It's intense periodic exertion,
which activates your fight or flight.

07:50.928 --> 07:54.765
It's not a real workout unless your body
is convinced it's being chased by a lion.

07:54.849 --> 07:56.267
Mm, that sounds factual.

07:56.350 --> 07:59.645
So, listen, I wanted to let you know
I'm heading out a little early today.

07:59.729 --> 08:02.482
I have some unused vacation days,
and you can fact-check that with Karen.

08:02.565 --> 08:04.233
Okay. Where you going?

08:04.317 --> 08:07.778
You and Flip Flop going on
a romantic weekend at a Sandals Resort?

08:07.862 --> 08:08.863
[chuckles]
"Sandals."

08:08.946 --> 08:11.908
That was really good. It's a little sad
no one else was around to hear that.

08:11.991 --> 08:14.660
I don't know. I might say it again later.
Seriously, where you going?

08:14.744 --> 08:16.954
We are going to a family bar mitzvah.

08:17.038 --> 08:19.749
So, he is going to meet
the entire Garfinkel clan.

08:19.832 --> 08:23.085
That's my mom's side of the family.
It will be wonderful.

08:23.169 --> 08:25.254
All right. If you say so.

08:25.338 --> 08:27.840
I do say so because
he is the man of my dreams.

08:27.924 --> 08:29.800
You know, you say that a lot.

08:29.884 --> 08:33.346
I've never heard anyone else use the term
"man of my dreams" before you.

08:33.429 --> 08:35.389
Sounds like something
a super secure person says.

08:35.473 --> 08:38.809
Uh, well, you don't know us
and you don't know me.

08:38.893 --> 08:40.186
And you don't know us, so...

08:40.269 --> 08:42.855
Well, you are gonna miss
something great around here.

08:42.939 --> 08:48.277
My father is just about to give us
a huge client. Massive.

08:48.361 --> 08:50.321
Just waiting
for the final go-ahead from him.

08:50.404 --> 08:53.324
So, go have fun.
I'll be here, being awesome.

08:54.575 --> 08:58.162
Oh, hey, on your way out, can you just
give me a roar? A loud, fast roar?

08:58.246 --> 09:02.041
Doesn't have to be a lion. It can be like
a howler monkey or something like that.

09:02.124 --> 09:04.544
Anything, really. Just a predator.

09:04.627 --> 09:07.213
A land-based predator would be--
Never mind.

09:07.296 --> 09:09.465
Have a great weekend.

09:09.549 --> 09:12.343
-It's a family event. That's a big step.
-Yeah.

09:13.594 --> 09:16.514
Almost as big as when you announced
your relationship status on Waze,

09:16.597 --> 09:18.474
which I didn't even know was a thing.

09:18.558 --> 09:21.352
Well, when it feels this great,
you want everyone to know.

09:22.603 --> 09:23.688
Everyone?

09:34.532 --> 09:35.950
Thank you for texting me back.

09:36.033 --> 09:38.411
I, um, used up my data plan

09:38.494 --> 09:41.956
sending you sad Bitmojis
and <i>Golden Girls</i> gifs.

09:42.039 --> 09:45.585
Jifs? Is it gifs or jifs?
Never mind, it's not your job to tell me.

09:45.668 --> 09:47.461
Yeah, uh...

09:47.545 --> 09:51.215
I had to take a few days
once I heard about you and Josh.

09:51.299 --> 09:53.467
I wanted to make sure you're okay.

09:53.551 --> 09:57.346
It's not my favorite thing,
you guys being a couple...

09:57.430 --> 09:58.681
but I'm okay.

09:58.764 --> 10:01.309
And are we okay?
The answer doesn't have to be "yes."

10:01.392 --> 10:04.812
Good because the answer is "eh."

10:04.895 --> 10:06.647
Totally get it.

10:06.731 --> 10:08.649
But don't worry about me, really.

10:08.733 --> 10:10.568
If you need to worry about someone,
worry about yourself.

10:10.651 --> 10:12.069
Me, why?

10:12.153 --> 10:15.448
Don't you see that Josh
is, like, all over the place and lost?

10:15.531 --> 10:17.408
But that was before.

10:17.491 --> 10:19.452
And I saw from a post
you shared on OpenTable

10:19.535 --> 10:21.203
that you're taking him home
to see your family.

10:22.079 --> 10:24.957
I know your relationship
with your mom is kinda tough.

10:25.041 --> 10:27.710
Yeah, but now I have Josh.
So, you know, it won't bother me.

10:29.045 --> 10:30.630
Love protects you.

10:30.713 --> 10:31.797
[scoffs]

10:31.881 --> 10:33.966
So, the things that used
to annoy me about going home

10:34.050 --> 10:35.968
won't annoy me anymore.

10:36.052 --> 10:41.349
You know? Josh is like a blankie,
a suit of armor, or a bulletproof vest.

10:41.432 --> 10:44.894
Honey, just because Josh Chan
owns all those things

10:44.977 --> 10:47.229
doesn't mean he <i>is</i> all those things.

10:47.313 --> 10:48.814
He's not magic.

10:48.898 --> 10:51.525
It's like magic, FB,
when Rebecca and I are together.

10:51.609 --> 10:54.153
Yeah, I read about it on your post
on Draw Something.

10:54.236 --> 10:56.113
-[bird twitters]
-Oh! Shh, shh!

10:57.782 --> 11:01.035
-Nope. Sorry, go on.
-[sighs]

11:01.118 --> 11:04.246
This family weekend is really important,
and I don't want to screw it up.

11:04.330 --> 11:05.915
You know Rebecca's mother doesn't like me.

11:05.998 --> 11:10.002
At Parents Weekend at camp, she asked me
if I had pierced her daughter's hymen.

11:10.086 --> 11:13.255
And I told her, "No, Rebecca showed up
to camp with those earrings."

11:14.090 --> 11:15.383
Wow.

11:15.466 --> 11:18.302
What if people don't like me?
What if I say the wrong thing?

11:18.386 --> 11:20.638
What if an old person calls me "Oriental"?

11:20.721 --> 11:21.722
[chuckles]

11:21.806 --> 11:26.018
Look, Josh, I'm a man of God and I try
to believe the best about everyone,

11:26.102 --> 11:28.896
but if you think you're gonna make it
through a whole weekend

11:28.979 --> 11:32.274
with a bunch of 70-year-olds
and not get called an "Oriental,"

11:32.358 --> 11:33.651
you're out of your ever-loving mind.

11:33.734 --> 11:35.694
-[bird twittering]
-Oh!

11:36.612 --> 11:38.739
[sighs]
Nope.

11:38.823 --> 11:41.742
Father Brah, I've been bouncing
from girl to girl all year.

11:41.826 --> 11:45.037
I've told everyone in my life,
including my followers on Moviefone,

11:45.121 --> 11:47.415
that Rebecca and I are the real deal.

11:47.498 --> 11:50.334
This relationship has to work out.
It just has to.

11:50.418 --> 11:52.962
Because it's the main thing
going on in your life right now?

11:54.046 --> 11:55.047
Yeah, kinda.

11:55.131 --> 11:59.260
Josh, do you think you're defining
yourself through your relationship?

12:00.469 --> 12:02.805
You define yourself
by your relationship to Jesus.

12:02.888 --> 12:09.061
Wow. You got me there, man.
Where are you, you little minx?

12:09.145 --> 12:11.230
Brah, I didn't know
you were into birdwatching.

12:11.313 --> 12:14.150
Oh, no, I'm not. I stashed my weed
in one of these trees.

12:14.859 --> 12:17.862
Oh! Yeah, there it is.

12:24.660 --> 12:27.163
Okay, so, if my mom asks,
you have no opinion on politics,

12:27.246 --> 12:28.914
I've been using
the bath salts she sent me,

12:28.998 --> 12:31.167
and the Garfinkel ring
is in the safe deposit box.

12:31.250 --> 12:34.628
-What's the Garfinkel ring?
-It's a long story. I'll tell you later.

12:34.712 --> 12:38.048
Okay, this is gonna be great
because, with you here, I'll be calm.

12:38.132 --> 12:41.760
-I love you.
-I love you too. It's gonna be great.

12:42.720 --> 12:44.054
Oh!

12:45.347 --> 12:47.975
-I forgot you were bringing the Oriental.
-Mom!

12:49.185 --> 12:50.269
[sighs]

12:57.610 --> 12:59.195
Would you--
Would you please put on a robe?

12:59.278 --> 13:03.365
I just moisturized. It has to soak in
for an hour or I'm wasting the La Mer.

13:03.449 --> 13:04.617
La Mer is for your face.

13:04.700 --> 13:07.495
I know it's for my face,
but, for once, I'm splurging on myself!

13:07.578 --> 13:10.915
I got you this Hollywood sign magnet
from the airport.

13:14.376 --> 13:17.046
-What's with the hair?
-Are you gonna say "thank you"?

13:17.129 --> 13:20.966
Looks stringy. I know that's the fashion,
but you look like a wet rescue dog.

13:21.050 --> 13:23.052
You know what?
Maybe we should just stay at a hotel.

13:23.135 --> 13:25.513
-We don't have to stay here.
-Oh, please. Don't be so dramatic.

13:25.638 --> 13:26.722
You came all this way

13:26.805 --> 13:30.017
to see your <i>fakakta </i>cousin
fumble through his <i>haftarah.</i>

13:30.100 --> 13:33.103
And, Becky, do you know
what Torah portion they gave Skyler?

13:33.187 --> 13:34.855
-What?
-The one with the menstruation

13:34.939 --> 13:36.065
and the lepers.

13:36.148 --> 13:40.110
[gasps] The one that cousin Stuey got
when he talked about his sister's Kotex.

13:40.194 --> 13:42.988
[both laughing]

13:43.072 --> 13:45.282
[laughing awkwardly]

13:45.366 --> 13:47.701
Are you guys not mad
at each other anymore?

13:47.785 --> 13:49.912
Mad? Who's mad? Is he yelling at me?

13:49.995 --> 13:51.664
-No.
-I'm the one who should be mad

13:51.747 --> 13:54.166
with this hunk of plastic
cluttering up my house.

13:54.250 --> 13:58.837
What, you couldn't find a See's Candy
walking through the airport?

13:58.921 --> 14:01.257
I'm sorry. Are you talking to me now?
I'm so confused.

14:01.340 --> 14:02.591
-No.
-You're confused?

14:02.675 --> 14:05.177
I've been confused ever since
this one popped out of my vagina.

14:05.261 --> 14:07.638
Oh, my God, Mom,
do not talk about your vagina.

14:07.721 --> 14:11.725
Why? It's perfectly good.
I have had some fabulous reviews lately.

14:11.809 --> 14:15.771
-Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew! Stop it!
-All right, listen up.

14:15.854 --> 14:20.609
I'm on a grapefruit diet, but for you,
I put whitefish salad in the refrigerator.

14:20.693 --> 14:23.904
Becca sometimes likes to eat
in the middle of the night

14:23.988 --> 14:25.739
and that's why her weight fluctuates.

14:25.823 --> 14:27.867
Okay, no, one time, one time, one time!

14:27.950 --> 14:31.287
Yes, I ate a whole marble halvah.
That was the night my father left.

14:31.370 --> 14:33.831
-It was my party and I was hungry.
-You hear the drama?

14:33.914 --> 14:36.917
"It was my party, I was hungry,
and my father abandoned me."

14:37.001 --> 14:38.460
Like we all didn't see that coming?

14:40.379 --> 14:41.463
Good night.

14:44.133 --> 14:45.134
Mom!

14:46.010 --> 14:48.178
I'm gonna moisturize the rest of me.

14:52.892 --> 14:55.019
-What are you working on, Tim?
-[gasps] Nothing.

14:56.186 --> 14:57.479
[whispering]
I'm sorry.

15:00.774 --> 15:03.402
Wait. Weren't you fired, Jordan?

15:03.485 --> 15:07.031
It's... It is "George,"
and, uh, Nathaniel hired me back

15:07.114 --> 15:10.284
'cause I guess you're shorthanded
and the firm has so much work to do.

15:10.367 --> 15:12.453
Oh, great. Yes, that's right.

15:12.536 --> 15:15.164
I do remember that now
because that was my idea.

15:16.290 --> 15:19.501
Hey, look at this busy bee.
How's it going M-Dog?

15:19.585 --> 15:21.086
Pretty good, D-Money.

15:21.170 --> 15:24.214
Hey, I have to cancel
Shirley Temples and karaoke tonight.

15:24.298 --> 15:25.382
I'm so slammed.

15:25.466 --> 15:27.593
What? Well, I can help--

15:29.094 --> 15:31.972
Sorry, I was specifically told
not to let you touch any of the work.

15:32.056 --> 15:35.601
What do you mean?
Wait, what's going on?

15:35.684 --> 15:36.894
Told that by whom?

15:36.977 --> 15:40.230
Heads up, folks. I just looked over
the briefs for the Peterson case.

15:40.314 --> 15:43.192
-It's "Petterson."
-It's not. It isn't.

15:43.275 --> 15:47.154
And so sad to say that they're
gonna need a major overhaul.

15:47.237 --> 15:49.323
Reason? They're garbage.

15:49.406 --> 15:51.700
I cannot show these
to my father, all right?

15:51.784 --> 15:54.536
If he's gonna give us this client,
we need to step up our game.

15:54.620 --> 15:59.291
Our work needs to be Ivy League,
and right now it's Arizona State.

15:59.375 --> 16:01.585
Go Sun Devils!

16:03.754 --> 16:07.341
So, we'll all be working on Saturday.

16:08.634 --> 16:10.678
[moans]

16:12.096 --> 16:14.890
[coughs, sniffles]

16:17.059 --> 16:19.103
-[door closes]
-[all moan]

16:19.186 --> 16:20.646
Oh, now you moan!

16:20.729 --> 16:23.816
I can't work on Saturday.
I've got the kids alone all day.

16:23.899 --> 16:26.360
I'm supposed to do an escape room
with my college roommate.

16:26.443 --> 16:28.445
Some of you might know her.
Zosia Mamet?

16:28.529 --> 16:30.906
My adult ceramics class
is finally gonna glaze.

16:30.990 --> 16:32.866
Look, I hear you, Jer--

16:32.950 --> 16:35.661
Wow! It's George. I literally have
the easiest name in the world.

16:35.744 --> 16:39.331
Guys, don't worry.
I can handle this. I still matter here.

16:39.415 --> 16:40.791
My name's still on the wall.

16:46.046 --> 16:48.841
I am not an emasculated sock puppet!

16:48.924 --> 16:51.510
What? No one called you that.

16:51.593 --> 16:53.887
Where did you even come up with that?

16:53.971 --> 16:57.683
No one said that under their breath?
I'm pretty sure I heard that.

16:57.766 --> 16:59.268
'Cause I would not just think that.

17:01.645 --> 17:04.106
We are not working Saturday.

17:04.189 --> 17:08.360
Watch. Watch this, guys. Watch... this.

17:13.115 --> 17:14.199
No.

17:17.369 --> 17:21.081
He said he'll think about it,
while we're working on Saturday.

17:24.001 --> 17:27.629
Don't cry. Don't cry,
you emasculated sock puppet.

17:27.713 --> 17:30.507
God, who said that to me?

17:30.591 --> 17:31.592
Wait...

17:34.803 --> 17:36.764
Where's all the candy?

17:36.847 --> 17:41.226
Um, Jim, do you know
where the good snacks are?

17:41.310 --> 17:45.439
Why do we have pepitas?
<i>¿Qué es pepitas?</i>

17:45.522 --> 17:47.816
-Nathaniel made us throw out the candy.
-He what?

17:47.900 --> 17:50.235
Yeah, he said it was disgusting,
it impacts productivity,

17:50.319 --> 17:51.945
and it's a tumor waiting to happen.

18:01.246 --> 18:03.332
I'm sorry we have to sleep on the sofa.

18:03.415 --> 18:07.586
My mom uses my room to hoard
old issues of <i>Marie Claire </i>magazine.

18:07.669 --> 18:10.255
Oh, she's nuts.
Are you okay? Is this okay?

18:10.339 --> 18:14.927
I'm fine. Are you?
She seems to rattle you.

18:15.010 --> 18:19.723
Yeah, you know, normally, she would,
but you're here, so it's helping.

18:19.807 --> 18:23.393
[Naomi] Don't touch the air conditioning!
I sweat like a pig!

18:23.477 --> 18:25.646
It's like the frozen tundra in here!

18:25.729 --> 18:26.814
Whoa!

18:26.897 --> 18:28.565
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

18:28.649 --> 18:33.153
Um, it's just... this place has
a slight negative energy for me.

18:33.237 --> 18:36.490
Yeah. Yeah, bad stuff has happened.
Like you see that end table?

18:36.573 --> 18:39.743
I used to hide under it when I was little
and compulsively scratch grooves

18:39.827 --> 18:40.869
into the inside leg.

18:40.953 --> 18:43.664
Yeah, I was a strong, feral little girl.

18:43.747 --> 18:45.666
That sounds terrible.

18:45.749 --> 18:49.294
Yep, yep, wasn't great, was not great.

18:49.378 --> 18:52.506
But... now, we can make good memories.

18:52.589 --> 18:55.926
And we can pave over the pain
and the suffering.

18:56.009 --> 18:58.762
I want to do that for you.
I want to help you with that.

18:59.555 --> 19:01.557
Oh, you're the sweetest.

19:05.102 --> 19:07.396
Uh, your mom is right upstairs, Becks.

19:07.479 --> 19:08.897
Oh, no, no. She sleeps like a rock.

19:08.981 --> 19:11.316
Yeah, glass of wine, sleeping pill,

19:11.400 --> 19:13.777
Billy Crystal's autobiography
splayed across her chest.

19:13.861 --> 19:14.945
Boom. Down for the count.

19:16.738 --> 19:18.323
Now, come on.

19:18.407 --> 19:21.577
I am ready to turn
my childhood trauma into a kink.

19:21.660 --> 19:22.953
I don't know. [moans]

19:25.747 --> 19:27.791
-[growls]
-[both moaning]

19:30.794 --> 19:32.045
I was afraid you might run out,

19:32.129 --> 19:35.299
so I looked and I found
some extra whitefish in the freezer,

19:35.382 --> 19:38.844
But I don't know how to thaw this thing.
Oh, please, don't stop on my account.

19:38.927 --> 19:41.555
Go ahead, get back in there,
get back in there.

19:41.638 --> 19:43.724
I've seen worse from this one.

19:43.807 --> 19:45.976
I will never forget
that crime scene I walked in on

19:46.059 --> 19:50.272
between you and Isaac Berger
of the Model UN.

19:50.355 --> 19:51.732
They were having...

19:51.815 --> 19:54.526
<i>♪ Period sex, period sex ♪</i>

19:54.610 --> 19:55.986
<i>♪ Put down a towel-- ♪</i>

19:56.069 --> 20:01.408
Mom! Oh, my God! Just stop ruining this
like you ruin everything!

20:01.491 --> 20:04.077
Hey, don't yell at me
in front of the Oriental.

20:04.161 --> 20:05.579
They're a very peaceful people.

20:05.662 --> 20:07.372
Oh, my God, you are so offensive!

20:07.456 --> 20:10.959
Okay, you know what, Mrs. Bunch?
Let me help thaw the fish.

20:11.043 --> 20:14.213
I'm really good at it.
My mom buys fish sticks in bulk.

20:14.296 --> 20:16.089
Why don't you and I go into the kitchen?

20:16.173 --> 20:19.801
Finally, someone who's actually offering
to help out around here.

20:20.802 --> 20:24.223
Finally, someone is not
completely selfish.

20:24.306 --> 20:26.099
Oh, oh, oh, I'm selfish.

20:26.183 --> 20:28.852
I mean, when those fish sticks
come out of the oven...

20:28.936 --> 20:30.520
[chuckles]

20:30.604 --> 20:31.688
Come on, then.

20:31.772 --> 20:34.316
Put your pickle in your pants
and let's thaw some fish. [clicks tongue]

20:36.985 --> 20:41.323
-I got this. Get some sleep, okay?
-Just be careful.

20:41.406 --> 20:43.367
-I love you.
-I love you.

20:47.996 --> 20:49.623
What a great job.

20:49.706 --> 20:52.292
The way you flipped it over
after you soaked it in the eggs...

20:52.376 --> 20:54.211
I was very impressed.

20:54.294 --> 20:56.922
-[both laughing]
-Mm. What's going on?

20:57.005 --> 20:59.132
Your mom taught me
how to make "holla" French toast.

20:59.216 --> 21:00.259
No, no, no. "Challah," Josh.

21:00.342 --> 21:03.679
-[enunciating] Ch, ch, ch...
-Holla, holla, holla...

21:03.762 --> 21:06.098
-I gotta keep working on it.
-You're gonna get it, <i>bubbelah.</i>

21:06.181 --> 21:07.516
You're gonna get it.

21:07.599 --> 21:10.727
He's never gonna get it. Why would he?
He's a Pacific Islander.

21:10.811 --> 21:12.604
Wow, what happened
to calling him Oriental?

21:12.688 --> 21:15.607
Rebecca, that term is considered
antiquated, Euro-centric,

21:15.691 --> 21:17.317
and inherently xenophobic.

21:17.401 --> 21:20.904
Yeah, we Googled it. I knew it was racist.
I just didn't know why.

21:21.947 --> 21:23.031
So, get woke, Becks.

21:23.115 --> 21:25.075
-Oh! Yeah!
-Hey!

21:25.158 --> 21:26.285
I love this woman!

21:26.368 --> 21:29.830
He's adorable. He's adorable.
He's adorable.

21:29.913 --> 21:30.914
I love her.

21:43.802 --> 21:47.347
Joshua, as soon as they open the stations,
we'd better be first in line,

21:47.431 --> 21:51.226
because rumor has it that Ellen has
only sprung for a one-hour buffet.

21:51.310 --> 21:53.061
-Can you believe that?
-I can't.

21:53.145 --> 21:56.064
Well, she's having money troubles.
And her mother has cancer.

21:56.148 --> 21:58.108
And the youngest daughter
wants to be a man.

21:58.191 --> 22:00.694
And the husband
is having an affair with a <i>goy.</i>

22:00.777 --> 22:03.739
-Oh, my God.
-Sorry. No offense.

22:03.822 --> 22:05.198
[chuckles]

22:05.282 --> 22:07.492
No, no, you don't have to laugh at that.
That's very offensive.

22:07.576 --> 22:08.618
Oh, Becca.

22:08.702 --> 22:10.704
Excuse me,
I'm gonna go get some dumplings.

22:10.787 --> 22:12.456
My blood sugar is in the toilet,

22:12.539 --> 22:14.291
which is where those dumplings
are gonna be.

22:14.374 --> 22:15.250
[both laughing]

22:15.334 --> 22:18.045
Eventually.
Well, they sit there, like rocks.

22:21.048 --> 22:22.090
[laughing]

22:22.174 --> 22:23.675
Listen, I appreciate
you trying to win her over,

22:23.759 --> 22:25.302
but you don't have to keep
pretending to like her.

22:25.385 --> 22:27.429
Oh, I'm not pretending. I do like her.

22:27.512 --> 22:29.347
In my family, we don't talk about poop.

22:29.431 --> 22:32.225
I had to learn about it
by watching an episode of <i>90210.</i>

22:32.309 --> 22:35.145
-She's awesome.
-Okay.

22:35.228 --> 22:38.482
Ooh! Should we take a selfie
with our matching little hats?

22:38.565 --> 22:40.734
#hebrewbeaniesforlife!

22:40.817 --> 22:43.028
They're called "<i>kippahs</i>."

22:43.111 --> 22:47.074
Oh, okay. So, #kippahingitreal!

22:47.157 --> 22:50.952
Um, no, you just do it. I'm not...
Sorry. I'm not feeling it.

22:51.036 --> 22:54.372
-Why are you in a bad mood, Becks?
-Just because... I don't know...

22:54.456 --> 22:58.835
-Rebecca! Welcome back!
-Hello, Rabbi Shari.

22:58.919 --> 23:02.589
How are you, my darling?
How is California?

23:02.672 --> 23:04.341
Have you found a temple out there yet?

23:04.424 --> 23:08.595
Well, I don't believe in God,
so, no, it didn't make my to-do list.

23:08.678 --> 23:10.555
Always questioning.

23:10.639 --> 23:15.936
That is the true spirit
of the Jewish people. Very good.

23:18.396 --> 23:20.023
-She seems nice.
-She's not nice.

23:20.107 --> 23:23.777
She's a programmed... robot, who's trying
to incept God into me all the time.

23:23.860 --> 23:27.489
Whoa. I didn't know that
and I know a ton about robots.

23:27.572 --> 23:29.991
I know, I know. It's just--
you see the good in everything,

23:30.075 --> 23:33.537
which is just so, so sweet.

23:33.620 --> 23:34.746
So...

23:34.830 --> 23:36.540
-Oh, no, boy.
-Wait, what is it?

23:36.623 --> 23:39.417
-Look who it is.
-Well, well, well.

23:39.501 --> 23:41.336
Rebecca Nora Bunch.

23:41.419 --> 23:43.421
Audra Esther Levine.

23:43.505 --> 23:45.173
Joshua Felix Chan.

23:46.133 --> 23:48.135
This is my husband, David.

23:48.218 --> 23:50.011
[sighs]
Yes, hi, we've met.

23:50.095 --> 23:51.471
How you doing, Rebecca?

23:51.555 --> 23:53.932
You guys know each other?

23:54.015 --> 23:57.394
Yep. Finished quick, rotten lay.

23:57.477 --> 23:58.603
We both heard that!

23:58.687 --> 24:01.815
Rebecca, hey, come on.
That's not nice.

24:01.898 --> 24:04.901
Nice to meet you, man. I'm Josh.
Hey, you know what they say.

24:04.985 --> 24:07.946
It's not how long you last.
It's how big your penis is.

24:08.029 --> 24:09.489
-[laughs]
-Ah!

24:10.699 --> 24:13.034
-Hey, man, I was kidding.
-Well...

24:13.743 --> 24:16.872
I see you two have really been
hitting the social media hard.

24:16.955 --> 24:18.957
You know you don't have to post
every photo, right?

24:19.040 --> 24:20.959
So funny that you say that
because I seem to remember

24:21.042 --> 24:23.712
your engagement photos
clogging up my feed for weeks.

24:23.795 --> 24:27.215
I mean, it is so crazy
that a photographer happened to be there

24:27.299 --> 24:29.676
when David gave you that ring
on that turn-of-the-century Ferris wheel.

24:29.759 --> 24:32.137
At least, I'm married
and not living in California

24:32.220 --> 24:34.181
and having a nervous breakdown.

24:34.264 --> 24:36.892
[chuckles] Right. Hey, remember
when I had sex with your husband? Yeah.

24:36.975 --> 24:40.312
As he finished he called me "Mom."
Have fun unpacking that. <i>Mazel tov.</i>

24:40.395 --> 24:41.479
-Hey, Josh!
-David!

24:41.563 --> 24:43.481
His solo's coming up.

24:43.565 --> 24:46.276
[guitar riff playing on speakers]

24:46.359 --> 24:47.444
[chuckles]

24:47.527 --> 24:51.156
This guy is the best! Turns out
we both love Dave Matthews Band!

24:51.948 --> 24:53.783
We should all go skiing in Mammoth!

24:53.867 --> 24:55.911
-Totally. This December?
-Done!

24:55.994 --> 24:56.995
-Yes!
-Yes!

24:59.748 --> 25:01.708
-You're still a bitch.
-So are you.

25:02.709 --> 25:04.836
-Yeah, it's not as fun now.
-No, it's not.

25:11.134 --> 25:12.177
Paula!

25:13.345 --> 25:14.346
Paula! Shh!

25:19.893 --> 25:21.102
Skittle me this...

25:21.186 --> 25:23.438
What is a way to get back
at a sugar dictator, hmm?

25:23.521 --> 25:25.565
You're freaking me out a little bit.

25:26.608 --> 25:28.318
Okay, hey. You know what?

25:28.401 --> 25:31.571
I'm starting to think that maybe this
whole thing is not actually about candy.

25:31.655 --> 25:33.073
You're right. It's about freedom!

25:33.156 --> 25:35.450
Oh, God, Darryl, would you get real?

25:35.533 --> 25:37.953
You regret selling the firm to Nathaniel,
which you should.

25:38.036 --> 25:40.538
It was a dumb move and he's a jerk.

25:40.622 --> 25:43.416
But you did it,
and now you gotta live with it.

25:44.709 --> 25:48.129
Seriously, you gotta calm down.
Your eyes are just-- They're vibrating.

25:48.922 --> 25:50.006
Do you have any aspirin?

25:50.882 --> 25:51.967
-And... bam!
-[camera clicks]

25:52.050 --> 25:53.468
That's how you do selfies, you guys.

25:53.551 --> 25:57.138
-That's masterful work right there.
-Hi. Cousin Rifka, thank you. Hi.

25:57.222 --> 25:59.557
Hey, there you are!
You want to do a photo?

25:59.641 --> 26:04.145
You want a boa? An old-timey hat?
A mustache stick?

26:04.229 --> 26:06.231
-I'm... I'm really good.
-[sighs]

26:06.314 --> 26:09.943
But they will tweet, Facebook, Instagram,
and Snapchat your photo automatically.

26:10.026 --> 26:12.070
Josh, I can't do this anymore.

26:13.113 --> 26:14.155
What do you mean?

26:14.948 --> 26:18.243
It's just-- you're not supposed
to be having this much fun.

26:18.326 --> 26:19.995
Koala...

26:20.078 --> 26:21.913
I thought you wanted me
to pave things over.

26:21.997 --> 26:24.416
I know. I know I said that, but what I...

26:24.499 --> 26:27.585
I don't know. What I think I wanted
was just for you and I to sit in a corner

26:27.669 --> 26:30.630
and laugh about how miserable
and terrible everyone is?

26:30.714 --> 26:33.091
But they're not miserable.

26:33.174 --> 26:35.385
-They're having fun.
-No, they're not having fun.

26:35.468 --> 26:39.180
They don't know how to have fun.
Okay, listen, you don't understand. Okay?

26:39.264 --> 26:41.474
You are, forgive me,
a non-Jew from the West Coast.

26:41.558 --> 26:44.060
Let me explain how it goes.
East Coast: dark, sad.

26:44.144 --> 26:45.603
West Coast: light, happy.

26:45.687 --> 26:49.024
All right, these people...
They don't understand what fun is.

26:49.107 --> 26:50.108
Trust me.

26:50.191 --> 26:53.528
All right, everyone,
in honor of the bar mitzvah boy...

26:53.611 --> 26:54.654
a hora!

26:54.738 --> 26:55.989
[people cheer, applaud]

26:56.072 --> 26:58.783
But it looks like they're about
to do some kind of fun dance.

26:58.867 --> 27:01.661
Case in point. Perfect example.
Okay, do you remember the ceremony?

27:01.745 --> 27:03.747
They made a 13-year-old boy
say the Kaddish.

27:03.830 --> 27:06.166
That's a prayer for the dead.

27:06.249 --> 27:08.668
People like us only know
how to be miserable.

27:08.752 --> 27:09.961
What do you mean?

27:10.045 --> 27:14.424
No, listen, Josh. It sounds
like one thing, but means another.

There are slats here.

29:19.632 --> 29:22.135
Have you ever hidden before?
Do you know what hiding is?

29:23.553 --> 29:27.348
If you stocked these cabinets with candy
when you knew I had it removed,

29:27.432 --> 29:30.143
that's gonna be a very big problem for us.

29:42.113 --> 29:43.198
I did it!

29:45.366 --> 29:48.912
It was me. I got the Snickers.

29:51.873 --> 29:53.500
And I got the Skittles.

29:55.752 --> 29:57.587
I got the Milk Duds.

I got the Toblerone.

No, I'm not having fun.
My boyfriend is, though.

30:36.626 --> 30:39.379
Yeah, he's making everyone really happy.
He loves it here.

30:39.462 --> 30:41.214
And that's not what you wanted?

30:41.297 --> 30:45.385
No! I wanted him to see
how unhappy everything makes me

30:45.468 --> 30:48.221
and that I'm right
and that everyone here is miserable.

30:48.304 --> 30:50.056
Why is everyone here miserable?

30:50.139 --> 30:52.559
Uh, I don't know.
Maybe because Jewish people's DNA

30:52.642 --> 30:55.645
is literally imprinted
with our past trauma?

30:55.728 --> 30:58.273
It's something called epigenetics.
Look it up.

30:58.356 --> 30:59.691

Rebecca, our people is not responsible
for your life. You are.

Maybe. I don't know. I just...
I hate it here. I hate all this stuff.

31:17.417 --> 31:22.505
Oh, well, this stuff, this town,
these people... they're you.

31:22.589 --> 31:24.674

you hate yourself.

31:24.757 --> 31:26.342

how great your boyfriend is.

31:30.889 --> 31:32.765
You'll always be unhappy.

But I thought that when you loved someone,

31:37.478 --> 31:40.982
it just fixed everything
and made your life great.

31:41.065 --> 31:43.443
That's a lot to put on a human being.

31:43.526 --> 31:46.404
Yeah, but he's not a human being.
He's Josh Chan.

31:48.239 --> 31:51.409
When we were kids,
he made me feel so happy. And...

31:52.410 --> 31:56.247

that if I could get back to that place,

31:56.331 --> 31:59.876

What's going on?

33:14.325 --> 33:18.371
Gotta burn the calories.
Gotta work hard.

33:18.454 --> 33:21.165
I had a brief lapse in judgment
with that stupid candy!

33:21.249 --> 33:23.167
But it's okay. I'll just burn it off.

33:23.251 --> 33:26.212
I gotta burn the mistakes.
I mean, burn the calories.

33:26.295 --> 33:28.548
Always improving, never a loser.

33:28.631 --> 33:31.050
Always improving, never a loser.

33:32.051 --> 33:34.095
No, no! Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
I don't think that's safe!

33:34.178 --> 33:35.596
-[groans]
-[gasps]

33:35.680 --> 33:37.682
Nathaniel, are you okay?

33:37.765 --> 33:40.393
[panting]

33:40.476 --> 33:42.395
I'm so sad.

33:42.478 --> 33:45.481
[crying]

33:55.575 --> 33:56.659
Are you okay?

33:58.119 --> 34:02.331
Yeah, I'm fine.
They gave me a temporary tooth.

34:04.333 --> 34:09.047
I'm sorry you had to see that, Darryl.
That was... not professional.

34:09.130 --> 34:13.760
-You know, it's okay to be upset.
-No, it's not. It's weak.

34:15.720 --> 34:17.722
Does this have something to do
with your dad?

34:19.432 --> 34:20.641
Did he not give you the account?

34:22.101 --> 34:23.853
Oh...

34:23.936 --> 34:28.357
You know, my dad is a real jerk too.
Oh! He used to yell at me all the time.

34:28.441 --> 34:30.943
He used to call me
an emasculated sock puppet.

34:31.027 --> 34:33.946
Oh! That's where that's from.

34:34.864 --> 34:36.824
I'm gonna bury that again.

34:36.908 --> 34:37.909
Hold on.

34:40.369 --> 34:42.163
Done. Ha!

34:42.246 --> 34:44.123
Hey, you know what?

34:44.207 --> 34:46.459
You're doing really well, Nathaniel.

34:46.542 --> 34:49.587
No, I see how hard you work,
how talented you are,

34:49.670 --> 34:51.255
how little food you eat. You're a very disciplined young man,

34:53.925 --> 34:56.302
and you don't need your dad
to tell you that.

34:56.385 --> 34:59.764
You have to know that for yourself.

35:02.934 --> 35:04.644
I've been kind of a jerk to you, Darryl.

35:06.229 --> 35:09.315
And I'm gonna pay to have the tooth blood
cleaned out of your car.

35:09.398 --> 35:10.691
Well, thank you.

35:12.693 --> 35:16.447
You're a good kid. Apology accepted.

35:16.531 --> 35:17.865
Well, I didn't apologize.

35:17.949 --> 35:20.576
Well, you kinda did.
I mean, basically, you did.

35:20.660 --> 35:22.161
Nope. Never happened.

35:29.794 --> 35:32.880
Babe, I'm sorry things didn't work out
the way you wanted.

35:32.964 --> 35:36.134
I was trying really hard, but I feel
like you wanted something from me,

35:36.217 --> 35:37.927
and I didn't give it to you.

35:38.010 --> 35:40.429
No, you were fine.
It's-- It's honestly all fine.

35:40.513 --> 35:41.597
Let's just go home.

35:43.182 --> 35:45.977
-Are you mad at me?
-No, no, I'm not mad.

35:46.060 --> 35:48.354
I just don't want to talk about it. Um...

35:49.689 --> 35:51.858
I left something in the bathroom.
I'll be right back.

35:51.941 --> 35:55.653
End of trip selfie?
#shalommeansbothhelloandgoodbye.

35:55.736 --> 35:57.655
No, I'm-- I'm good. Thanks.

36:01.200 --> 36:02.994
[door opens, closes]

36:03.077 --> 36:06.038
I'm gonna wrap this lox up
so you have something to eat on the plane.

36:06.122 --> 36:07.707
Now, I know it may not be enough,

36:07.790 --> 36:10.960
but those nitwits at the deli
were running short and I...

36:11.043 --> 36:12.128
Josh...

36:12.211 --> 36:14.005
Huh? What?

36:14.088 --> 36:15.673
What's wrong?

36:16.507 --> 36:18.176
Uh, it's just...

36:21.095 --> 36:23.389
Rebecca seems like she's mad at me.

36:23.472 --> 36:25.975
And I wanted this weekend
to bring us together,

36:26.058 --> 36:28.269
but it feels like she's pulling away.

36:28.352 --> 36:31.355
And you have no idea how much
this relationship means to me.

36:31.439 --> 36:34.650
I told everyone about it.
It can't fall apart now. Well, it won't...
because I won't let that happen.

36:38.029 --> 36:39.363
You won't?

36:39.447 --> 36:44.660
No, I actually think you and Rebecca
are pretty wonderful together.

36:44.744 --> 36:47.496
You soften some of her sharp edges,
thank God.

36:47.580 --> 36:50.249
[chuckles]
Wow.

36:50.333 --> 36:52.752
Thanks, Naomi.
That's nice of you to say.

36:53.753 --> 36:55.338
But what do I do now?

36:55.421 --> 36:58.341
Joshua, I am your Jewish mother now,

36:58.424 --> 37:01.385
and there are two things
I will always have.

37:01.469 --> 37:03.346
Indigestion and all the answers.

37:03.930 --> 37:04.764
[chuckles]

37:04.847 --> 37:07.725
So, just listen to me
and do exactly as I say.

37:22.073 --> 37:23.199
You know what?

37:24.158 --> 37:26.202
I do eat a bit too much candy.

37:26.285 --> 37:30.581
My liver is basically 40 percent
high fructose corn syrup. [chuckles]

37:30.665 --> 37:31.791
Well, good choice.

37:32.750 --> 37:35.378
You know, I was thinking, Darryl--
[clears throat] I'm so slammed.

37:35.461 --> 37:38.589
Maybe you would like to take over
the Crestfield account?

37:38.673 --> 37:42.510
The what? That's...
That's, like, our biggest client.

37:42.593 --> 37:45.429
Yeah, and I need a co-pilot.

37:47.098 --> 37:50.726
Co-pilot Darryl C. Whitefeather
reporting for duty, sir.

37:52.645 --> 37:56.941
Maya, could you please get that?
I'm very busy. Got a ton of work to do.

37:58.567 --> 38:00.027
Your office is that way.

38:04.699 --> 38:07.076
I don't know.
I've been giving it a lot of thought.

38:07.159 --> 38:10.246
And maybe Rabbi Shari's right.

38:11.247 --> 38:12.915
About me not loving myself.

38:12.999 --> 38:14.292
You know, maybe there's...

38:15.459 --> 38:18.129
there's something else
at the core of my unhappiness

38:18.212 --> 38:19.588
that I didn't realize.

38:22.925 --> 38:24.760
I'm sorry, what did you say?

38:24.844 --> 38:30.683
Well, she said that I wouldn't find
my answers in another person, and...

38:30.766 --> 38:33.102
I don't know.
That's starting to make a lot of sense.

38:35.688 --> 38:38.774
[whistling]

38:40.401 --> 38:41.694
Go on.

38:42.445 --> 38:45.531
Well, I moved to West Covina

38:45.614 --> 38:47.908
'cause I thought my problems
would be solved by a boy.

38:49.118 --> 38:54.123
Now, I'm with that boy, and...
I still have the same problems.

38:54.206 --> 38:58.294
So... I don't know.
Maybe it's something else.

38:58.377 --> 39:03.007
And if he is not the answer,

39:03.090 --> 39:06.052
what could it be about?

39:07.053 --> 39:08.220
It could be...

39:10.139 --> 39:11.307
my own issues.

39:13.768 --> 39:15.770
Oh, what's wrong?

39:15.853 --> 39:19.648
Nothing. It's just... I'm...

39:19.732 --> 39:22.902
I'm so... happy.

39:22.985 --> 39:24.779
Oh.

39:24.862 --> 39:27.448
Could you stay a little longer today?

39:28.574 --> 39:32.036
Candace! Cancel my next five appointments!

39:32.119 --> 39:36.957
Rebecca, do you think
that you're finally really ready

39:37.041 --> 39:39.835
to confront your issues?

39:40.669 --> 39:44.673
I think... I think maybe...

39:44.757 --> 39:46.258
Yes. Yes, I am.

39:47.385 --> 39:50.137
[whistling]

39:50.221 --> 39:52.473
-What's that noise?
-Nothing. It doesn't matter.

39:52.556 --> 39:55.267
You were saying
you can't be happy in life

39:55.351 --> 39:57.186
until you're happy with yourself?

39:57.269 --> 40:02.149
Yes, but figuring out what that is,
being happy with myself...

40:03.275 --> 40:06.404
That's a hard and scary road
that I don't know if I want to go down.

40:06.487 --> 40:08.739
-[whistling continues]
-What is that noise?

40:08.823 --> 40:13.160
Don't-Don't-- Stay with me.
Come on. Stay with me.

40:13.244 --> 40:15.329
So, maybe...

40:15.413 --> 40:18.290
maybe I need to just take
some time on my own...

40:19.917 --> 40:20.876
to figure--

40:23.003 --> 40:25.297
-Josh?
-What are you doing here?

40:29.009 --> 40:31.512
The Garfinkel ring. But how did you--?

40:31.595 --> 40:35.141
You told me you pawned it, so I went
to the pawn shop on East Cameron--

40:35.224 --> 40:36.225
Rebecca, stay with me.

40:36.308 --> 40:40.271
You're working on yourself,
you're taking time out to be alone...

40:40.354 --> 40:44.567
Oh, my God, you remembered me
saying that? This is so romantic.

40:46.360 --> 40:50.906
Oh, no! No! No! No!

40:57.329 --> 41:01.041
Oh, my God, this is like a fairy tale.
This is everything I've ever wanted.

41:01.125 --> 41:02.835
[Akopian]
Get up, Josh. Get up.

41:04.253 --> 41:07.173
-Get up, Josh!
-Rebecca Nora Bunch...

41:07.256 --> 41:08.632
-...will...
-No! [gasps]

41:10.176 --> 41:12.219
-...you...
-Wait!

41:13.387 --> 41:15.598
-...marry...
-Please!

41:15.681 --> 41:18.058
-...me?
-Yes!

41:18.142 --> 41:19.226
No!

41:19.310 --> 41:20.686
[groans]

41:28.944 --> 41:31.572
-So, you live in Los Angeles?
-Basically.

41:31.655 --> 41:33.616
-Do you know Jeremy Stein?
-No.

41:33.699 --> 41:36.035
-Do you know Josh Berger?
-No.

41:36.118 --> 41:37.703
-Do you know Sam Goldberg?
-Nope.

41:37.786 --> 41:39.038
-Do you know Sammy Goldberg?
-No.

41:39.121 --> 41:40.915
-Did you go to Camp Nock-A-Mixon?
-No.

41:40.998 --> 41:42.708
-Did you go to Camp Winadu?
-No.

41:43.542 --> 41:47.004
-Have you ever met a Jew before Rebecca?
-No.

41:47.087 --> 41:49.548
Yeah, probably should've started
with that question.
