Darn TV, it never works
when you need it.

01:08.067 --> 01:09.534
Hey, I offered
to fix it,

01:09.536 --> 01:11.469
but Leonardo insists
on doing it himself.

01:11.471 --> 01:13.438
That's our fearless
leader for you.

01:13.440 --> 01:15.640
I can do it,
I tell you.

01:15.642 --> 01:17.875
All I have to do
is twist this knob and--

01:17.877 --> 01:18.809
Whoa!

01:19.945 --> 01:21.346
I can't understand it.

01:21.348 --> 01:23.081
I had the right knob.

01:23.083 --> 01:25.684
But you did not have
the right attitude.

01:25.686 --> 01:29.454
The true ninja spirit must
be applied to all tasks,

01:29.456 --> 01:33.124
even repairing
a television set.

01:33.126 --> 01:35.060
<i>We're here at the</i>
<i>Japanese embassy,</i>

01:35.062 --> 01:37.361
talking with
Ambassador Murishima,

01:37.363 --> 01:40.732
who is hosting this exhibition
of historic artifacts.

01:40.734 --> 01:42.601
Can you tell us
about them, Ambassador?

01:42.603 --> 01:44.001
Gladly, Ms. O'Neil.

01:44.003 --> 01:46.738
The most priceless object
in the entire collection

01:46.740 --> 01:48.973
is this ancient,
legendary weapon.

01:48.975 --> 01:51.576
The Sword of Yurikawa.

01:51.578 --> 01:53.377
You recognize it,
sensei?

01:53.379 --> 01:54.946
How could I not?

01:54.948 --> 01:57.348
It once belonged
to my own ninja master.

01:57.350 --> 02:03.021
The Sword of Yurikawa
has the amazing power
of transformation:

02:03.023 --> 02:06.858
always changing,
yet always the same.

02:06.860 --> 02:08.826
Whoa! Time out.

02:08.828 --> 02:10.294
If something changes,

02:10.297 --> 02:13.031
then how can it,
like, stay the same?

02:13.033 --> 02:14.732
Forget it, Michelangelo.

02:14.734 --> 02:15.934
It's too deep for you.

02:15.936 --> 02:18.102
A kiddie's wading pool
is too deep for him.

02:18.104 --> 02:20.905
If such a weapon should
fall into the wrong hands,

02:20.907 --> 02:22.941
it could have dire
consequences.

02:22.943 --> 02:25.677
My students, you must
go at once to guard it.

02:25.679 --> 02:27.412
Aw, come on, sensei.

02:27.414 --> 02:29.481
Couldn't we wait
until after dinner?

02:29.483 --> 02:31.282
We're about to chow down.

02:31.284 --> 02:32.950
Yeah. Besides,
I'm sure the embassy

02:32.952 --> 02:35.020
has their own people
to guard the sword.

02:35.022 --> 02:36.387
It is obvious you turtles

02:36.389 --> 02:38.789
do not have
the true ninja spirit.

02:38.791 --> 02:39.858
[sigh]

02:39.860 --> 02:41.326
Master Splinter
is right.

02:41.328 --> 02:43.394
We don't have
the true ninja spirit.

02:43.396 --> 02:46.131
Now let's go show them
what we're made of.

02:46.133 --> 02:48.599
[all grumbling]

02:51.837 --> 02:53.437
Observe, Shredder,

02:53.439 --> 02:57.342
as I demonstrate my latest
brilliant invention:

02:57.344 --> 03:00.044
the Mind Bender Ray.

03:02.848 --> 03:04.416
Lean to the left.

03:05.484 --> 03:07.085
[Krang]
Lean to the right.

03:07.087 --> 03:09.320
Stand up, sit down,
fight, fight, fight.

03:11.190 --> 03:12.957
There you go-- ooh!

03:12.959 --> 03:14.492
You see, Shredder?

03:14.494 --> 03:16.594
Total obedience.

03:16.596 --> 03:19.531
My mind bender gives
me complete power

03:19.533 --> 03:23.835
over any mutant-like forms
with level Z brainwaves.

03:23.837 --> 03:25.136
Big deal.

03:25.138 --> 03:27.572
So you can control
anyone dumber than mud.

03:27.574 --> 03:31.176
Hey, we're as smart
as mud any day.

03:31.178 --> 03:33.211
Yeah, maybe even smarter.

03:33.213 --> 03:36.981
Observe how I intend
putting it to use.

03:36.983 --> 03:38.383
The Tri-State Bridge.

03:38.385 --> 03:39.683
Yes.

03:39.685 --> 03:41.619
Tomorrow, a truck convoy

03:41.621 --> 03:44.355
carrying a rare form
of toxic waste

03:44.357 --> 03:47.358
is scheduled
to drive across it.

03:47.360 --> 03:51.195
By blowing up the bridge
just at the right moment,

03:51.197 --> 03:53.798
the toxins will
fall into the water

03:53.800 --> 03:56.600
and combine
with the harbor sludge,

03:56.602 --> 03:59.870
creating a new race
of mud mutants,

03:59.872 --> 04:02.773
which I alone will control.

04:02.775 --> 04:04.442
Hmm.

04:04.444 --> 04:06.777
Putting toxic waste
to good use.

04:06.779 --> 04:07.778
A novel idea.

04:07.780 --> 04:09.747
Rocksteady, Beebop!

04:09.749 --> 04:11.149
Start loading the explosive

04:11.151 --> 04:13.418
so we can blow up
that bridge!

04:13.420 --> 04:14.986
And remember, Shredder,

04:14.988 --> 04:18.957
this operation requires
a hands-on approach.

04:18.959 --> 04:21.392
Something you could
never manage,

04:21.394 --> 04:23.727
seeing as how you
don't have any hands.

04:23.729 --> 04:25.229
[laughing]

04:25.231 --> 04:27.966
You never miss a shot,
do you?

04:30.236 --> 04:32.070
Why, it's April O' Neil!

04:32.072 --> 04:35.673
This fabulous exhibit will
be at the Japanese embassy

04:35.675 --> 04:37.141
for one week only.

04:37.143 --> 04:38.476
So don't fail to see--

04:38.478 --> 04:40.911
[April, Shredder]
The Sword of Yurikawa.

04:40.913 --> 04:42.813
With that
in my possession,

04:42.815 --> 04:44.815
there'll be no need
for explosives.

04:44.817 --> 04:48.386
Shredder, what are you
blathering about?

04:48.388 --> 04:50.021
There's no time
to explain.

04:50.023 --> 04:51.889
I must get
to the surface now!

04:51.891 --> 04:54.992
He's always been a sucker
for a pretty sword.

05:00.732 --> 05:04.469
<i>This is April O'Neil,</i>
<i>Channel 6 News, signing off.</i>

05:04.471 --> 05:07.338
Ah! the Sword of Yurikawa.

05:07.340 --> 05:09.807
I must make it part
of my collection.

05:09.809 --> 05:14.012
Every rare and exotic weapon
known to man is in this room.

05:14.014 --> 05:17.681
Priceless tools of combat
from throughout history,

05:17.683 --> 05:19.050
all mine.

05:19.052 --> 05:21.553
But the rarest weapon
of all,

05:21.555 --> 05:23.321
the Sword of Yurikawa,

05:23.323 --> 05:25.123
has always eluded me.

05:25.125 --> 05:27.726
Until now, that is.

05:31.130 --> 05:34.599
Let me see.
Now, which of my weapons

05:34.601 --> 05:36.368
shall I use to do the job?

05:36.370 --> 05:39.837
This calls for something
simple but maneuverable.

05:39.839 --> 05:44.442
Small, unobtrusive,
yet extremely effective.

05:44.444 --> 05:45.443
Voila!

05:45.445 --> 05:47.178
I have found it!

05:47.180 --> 05:50.114
So tasteful, so elegant.

05:50.116 --> 05:52.917
Who would ever guess
its destructive power?

05:56.254 --> 05:57.455
At last,

05:57.457 --> 05:59.156
the Sword of Yurikawa

05:59.158 --> 06:01.058
will be mine.

06:05.664 --> 06:08.399
Dudes, I have got
the major munchies.

06:08.401 --> 06:09.701
Well, forget it.

06:09.703 --> 06:11.769
We've got to get to
the Japanese Embassy.

06:11.771 --> 06:14.372
Chill, this will
only take a second.

06:14.374 --> 06:16.507
Wait, Michelangelo.
Don't!

06:18.743 --> 06:20.044
Sorry, compadres.

06:20.046 --> 06:24.315
I just can't resist an
anchovy and hot fudge pizza.

06:24.317 --> 06:26.050
You heard Master Splinter.

06:26.052 --> 06:28.919
We're supposed to use
true ninja attitude.

06:28.921 --> 06:32.022
But, dude, how can we
practice ninja silence

06:32.024 --> 06:33.758
with our stomachs growling?

06:33.760 --> 06:36.461
Yeah, Michelangelo's
got a point there.

06:36.463 --> 06:37.462
[sniffing]

06:37.464 --> 06:39.397
There is a certain
logic to his thinking.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.266
[sniffing]

06:41.268 --> 06:44.702
I suppose
it couldn't hurt.

06:44.704 --> 06:47.471
[all]
Turtles eat with honor!

07:39.257 --> 07:40.425
We're here, fellas.

07:40.427 --> 07:42.693
The embassy is just
around this corner.

07:42.695 --> 07:43.895
<i>[police radio]</i>

07:43.897 --> 07:45.863
Uh-oh.
The boys in blue.

07:45.865 --> 07:46.797
What's going on?

07:46.799 --> 07:49.233
Put out an APB
for the entire area.

07:49.235 --> 07:52.002
The Sword of Yurikawa
has just been stolen.

07:52.004 --> 07:53.204
Stolen?

07:53.206 --> 07:54.271
We're too late.

07:54.273 --> 07:55.840
I don't believe it.

07:55.842 --> 07:57.775
We blew our assignment
for a lousy pizza.

07:57.777 --> 08:00.144
I agree, amigo.

08:00.146 --> 08:03.214
That crust was
seriously stale.

08:03.216 --> 08:05.082
We can't go home
without that sword.

08:05.084 --> 08:07.184
How would we face
Master Splinter?

08:07.186 --> 08:08.553
Donatello's right.

08:08.555 --> 08:11.389
We'll just have to track
it down ourselves.

08:11.391 --> 08:12.390
Yeah, right.

08:12.392 --> 08:14.058
Like we're just gonna
turn a corner

08:14.060 --> 08:15.493
and boom, there it is.

08:15.495 --> 08:17.361
There it is!

08:17.363 --> 08:19.230
The Sword of Yurikawa!

08:19.232 --> 08:21.432
You'd better hand
that over, friend!

08:24.436 --> 08:25.703
Whoa!

08:25.705 --> 08:27.338
Neat parlor trick.

08:27.340 --> 08:29.240
Well,
easy, buddy!

08:29.242 --> 08:31.208
We don't have
any fire insurance.

08:44.423 --> 08:46.824
Somehow he set
that sword on fire.

08:49.228 --> 08:52.797
I think it's time to lower
this guy's temperature.

09:03.975 --> 09:05.476
My turn, guys.

09:10.282 --> 09:11.749
Ow!

09:11.751 --> 09:12.683
That smarts.

09:14.286 --> 09:16.654
Remember what
Master Splinter said.

09:16.656 --> 09:18.122
True ninja spirit.

09:18.124 --> 09:20.725
[all]
Turtle power!

09:23.128 --> 09:25.630
[muffled shouts]

09:27.065 --> 09:29.467
I thought we were supposed
to do stuff like that.

09:29.469 --> 09:32.670
Whoever that dude was,
he's gone now.

09:32.672 --> 09:34.639
Remind me to make a note.

09:34.641 --> 09:37.408
Well, Shredder,
back I see.

09:37.410 --> 09:40.411
Yes, and my mission
was successful.

09:40.413 --> 09:43.514
Now feast your eyes
on the sheer magnificence

09:43.516 --> 09:45.917
of the Sword of Yurikawa.

09:45.919 --> 09:49.621
It looks like an everyday
run-of-the-mill sword to me.

09:49.623 --> 09:52.123
That's where
you're wrong, Krang.

09:52.125 --> 09:55.793
This sword can transform
itself into anything I wish!

09:55.795 --> 09:58.162
Observe.

09:58.164 --> 10:03.735
I'll bet you also believe
in the tooth fairy. Ha!

10:03.737 --> 10:04.936
In a moment,
you'll be laughing

10:04.938 --> 10:06.838
out of the other
side of your brain!

10:12.110 --> 10:14.945
You call that
a transformation?

10:14.947 --> 10:19.150
He turned it into a pile
of junk, didn't he?

10:19.152 --> 10:21.018
This is a fake!

10:21.020 --> 10:24.288
Someone must have stolen the
real sword before I arrived.

10:24.290 --> 10:26.958
I'm going to find
out who it was!

10:26.960 --> 10:28.292
Come along, you two.

10:28.294 --> 10:31.829
Shredder, forget
the blasted sword.

10:31.831 --> 10:34.699
We've got to rig that
bridge with explosives

10:34.701 --> 10:36.967
before the convoy arrives.

10:36.969 --> 10:39.671
The sword will be
much more effective.

10:39.673 --> 10:41.673
Trust me.

10:43.342 --> 10:44.575
"Trust me."

10:44.577 --> 10:47.144
I've heard that before.

10:47.146 --> 10:50.481
April calling the Turtles,
come in, Turtles.

10:50.483 --> 10:51.649
[Donatello]
We're right here,
April.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.818
I can hear you,
but I can't see you.

10:53.820 --> 10:55.352
That's because
we're right here.

10:55.354 --> 10:57.355
Wow, that was fast.

10:57.357 --> 11:00.157
I got a copy of the
surveillance videotape
from the embassy.

11:00.159 --> 11:03.060
It might give us some clues
as to who stole that sword.

11:03.062 --> 11:06.363
I wonder if there's time
to run out for some popcorn.

11:06.365 --> 11:09.100
[April]
This is the embassy
trophy room,

11:09.102 --> 11:10.835
and that is the
Sword of Yurikawa!

11:10.837 --> 11:13.137
Hmm, looks pretty
ordinary to me.

11:13.139 --> 11:14.738
Not according
to Master Splinter.

11:15.908 --> 11:17.341
What happened?

11:17.343 --> 11:19.443
Let's get a closer
look at that,

11:19.445 --> 11:21.111
in slow motion.

11:21.113 --> 11:22.847
So that's what happened.

11:22.849 --> 11:24.782
Someone smashed the camera.

11:24.784 --> 11:27.351
[Michelangelo]
And scope out that
righteous ring.

11:27.353 --> 11:29.987
Mind if I use your
computer to run a check
on that ring, April?

11:29.989 --> 11:31.689
Well, it's against
station--

11:31.691 --> 11:32.924
Thanks.

11:32.926 --> 11:34.926
[Donatello]
The Maltese ring,

11:34.928 --> 11:36.928
an ancient,
handcrafted weapon,

11:36.930 --> 11:38.629
suspected to be
in the possession

11:38.631 --> 11:40.230
of Lafayette Le Drone,

11:40.232 --> 11:41.866
international
weapons collector.

11:41.868 --> 11:43.667
Lafayette Le Drone?

11:43.669 --> 11:45.536
He's got that big
mansion across town.

11:45.538 --> 11:47.237
Well, let's hit it.

11:47.239 --> 11:48.673
Later, April.

11:48.675 --> 11:51.542
Cowabunga!

11:51.544 --> 11:54.812
First the turtles
follow April O'Neil,

11:54.814 --> 11:57.782
then we
follow the turtles.

11:57.784 --> 11:59.016
Now come on!

12:03.221 --> 12:06.090
Okay.
This is Le Drone's pad.

12:06.092 --> 12:07.825
Well, what are we
waiting for?

12:15.567 --> 12:17.468
Look, there's Le Drone now,

12:17.470 --> 12:18.736
and he's got the sword.

12:18.738 --> 12:22.440
At last, the Sword
of Yurikawa is mine!

12:22.442 --> 12:25.810
Ooh, how I have dreamt
of this moment,

12:25.812 --> 12:27.111
but I must say,

12:27.113 --> 12:28.780
it is almost sad, no?

12:28.782 --> 12:31.716
I mean, after this,
what further challenge

12:31.718 --> 12:32.984
does life have to offer?

12:32.986 --> 12:34.451
You want a challenge?

12:34.453 --> 12:36.353
You got a challenge.

12:36.355 --> 12:39.056
In fact, we're having a
special on challenges today.

12:39.058 --> 12:41.358
Four for the price of one.

12:41.360 --> 12:42.960
No salesman will call,

12:42.962 --> 12:44.862
but we will.

12:44.864 --> 12:46.363
Better hand over
that sword now.

12:46.365 --> 12:48.465
Why,<i> certainment.</i>
I will be happy to.

12:48.467 --> 12:49.566
You will?

12:49.568 --> 12:51.969
I was sure this would
turn into a fight scene.

12:51.971 --> 12:53.437
Careful, Raphael.

12:53.439 --> 12:55.472
It might be some
kind of double cross.

12:55.474 --> 12:57.175
How ridiculous.

12:57.177 --> 12:59.143
For a double cross,
I would need...

13:00.578 --> 13:02.913
a double crossbow!

13:05.650 --> 13:07.084
[all]
Gas bombs.

13:07.086 --> 13:11.055
Now you uninvited guests will
see what my weapons can do.

13:14.325 --> 13:15.793
Whoa!

13:19.998 --> 13:21.264
Head's up, dudes!

13:21.266 --> 13:24.769
He's got the whole place
booby-trapped.

13:24.771 --> 13:27.671
Two down and two to go.

13:38.617 --> 13:41.184
Don't just hang around
like that, Michelangelo.

13:41.186 --> 13:42.653
I need your help.

13:44.389 --> 13:46.323
Thanks,
I needed that.

13:46.325 --> 13:50.328
Go green machine.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.529
I have not yet run
out of tricks.

13:54.599 --> 13:56.133
Hey, what's going on?

13:56.135 --> 13:57.567
<i>Au revoir.</i>

13:58.803 --> 14:01.739
For all of you
non-French-speaking viewers,

14:01.741 --> 14:04.241
that means...[gulp]--
good-bye.

14:08.646 --> 14:09.980
It broke.

14:09.982 --> 14:12.016
That sword was bogus.

14:12.018 --> 14:13.584
<i>Sacré bleu!</i>

14:13.586 --> 14:17.188
Someone must have stolen the
real sword before I got there.

14:17.190 --> 14:19.724
Until we meet again,
turtles.

14:19.726 --> 14:21.992
A corny secret passageway?

14:21.994 --> 14:22.826
Give me a break.

14:22.828 --> 14:24.528
Forget Le Drone.

14:24.530 --> 14:27.397
It's more important that
we find the real sword.

14:27.399 --> 14:29.934
Let's go, Turtles!

14:33.438 --> 14:34.906
Gone at last.

14:34.908 --> 14:36.573
I thought they
would never leave.

14:37.876 --> 14:40.577
From the frying pan
into the fire, little man.

14:40.579 --> 14:42.580
More intruders!

14:44.282 --> 14:46.984
Easy, Le Drone.
We're on the same side.

14:46.986 --> 14:48.619
Who are you?

14:48.621 --> 14:50.220
I am called the Shredder,

14:50.222 --> 14:53.490
and world conquest
is my destiny.

14:53.492 --> 14:56.994
I admire your
collection of weapons.

14:56.996 --> 15:00.297
Perhaps we could join forces
against the turtles.

15:00.299 --> 15:04.001
<i>Moi?</i>
Join forces with you?

15:04.003 --> 15:05.069
Why on earth should I?

15:05.071 --> 15:06.403
Give me one good reason.

15:06.405 --> 15:10.808
Because here's what will
happen if you refuse.

15:12.443 --> 15:14.878
Ah. Well, that
is one good reason.

15:14.880 --> 15:16.047
We both want that sword.

15:16.049 --> 15:18.949
Once I've used it
for my own purposes,

15:18.951 --> 15:21.052
You may keep it
for your collection.

15:21.054 --> 15:25.022
<i>Monsieur</i> Shredder,
you have a deal.

15:25.024 --> 15:26.723
Yes, a deal that
will see the end

15:26.725 --> 15:30.795
of the Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles.

15:30.797 --> 15:32.495
[Shredder laughing]

15:32.497 --> 15:34.098
[Le Drone]
Oh, I like that.

15:34.100 --> 15:37.034
[Le Drone laughing]

15:39.337 --> 15:40.604
Face it, compadres,

15:40.606 --> 15:42.072
we're just gonna
have to cop

15:42.074 --> 15:43.940
to Master Splinter
that we blew it.

15:43.942 --> 15:45.775
Michelangelo's right.

15:45.777 --> 15:47.844
The Sword of Yurikawa
is gone.

15:47.846 --> 15:49.446
And it's all our fault.

15:49.448 --> 15:51.715
Maybe he'll be willing
to forgive and forget.

15:51.717 --> 15:52.916
It's him.

15:52.918 --> 15:54.117
The ninja warrior.

15:54.119 --> 15:55.552
[Donatello]
And he's got the sword.

15:55.554 --> 16:00.157
Let's show this dude what
happens to sword swipers.

16:05.997 --> 16:07.531
Okay, now what?

16:07.533 --> 16:10.267
Maybe if we ask
for the sword
in a reasonable way?

16:10.269 --> 16:13.003
It's worth a try.

16:13.005 --> 16:14.004
All right.

16:14.006 --> 16:17.007
Hand it over before
someone gets hurt.

16:19.144 --> 16:21.078
Radical.
It worked.

16:22.547 --> 16:23.714
Wait.

16:23.716 --> 16:25.816
He wants you to attack
him with the sword.

16:25.818 --> 16:26.916
I can't do that.

16:26.918 --> 16:28.585
He's totally defenseless.

16:28.587 --> 16:29.986
Well, you have to do it,

16:29.988 --> 16:31.321
or you'll insult
his ninja honor.

16:31.323 --> 16:33.957
I don't like it,
but here goes!

16:33.959 --> 16:36.660
Ow!
It's turning red hot.

16:36.662 --> 16:37.928
I can't hold on to it!

16:37.930 --> 16:38.929
Yow!

16:38.931 --> 16:39.863
[clanging]

16:41.900 --> 16:43.233
Wait!
Come back!

16:44.769 --> 16:46.336
Aw, he's gone.

16:46.338 --> 16:50.341
Way hot!
It's totally cold.

16:50.343 --> 16:52.509
You know there's something
really weird going on here.

16:52.511 --> 16:54.311
Hmm.

16:54.313 --> 16:57.113
Maybe Master Splinter will
be able to explain it.

16:57.115 --> 16:58.982
<i>Shredder!</i>

16:58.984 --> 17:01.685
<i>Why haven't you planted</i>
<i>those explosives?</i>

17:01.687 --> 17:05.155
The truck convoy carrying
that toxic waste

17:05.156 --> 17:07.925
is scheduled to cross
the Tri-State Bridge

17:07.926 --> 17:10.926
in exactly 23 minutes.

17:10.929 --> 17:14.196
If it's not blown up at
precisely the right moment,

17:14.199 --> 17:18.068
our entire scheme
will go up in smoke.

17:18.069 --> 17:20.871
[Shredder]
Don't get your medulla
in an uproar, Krang.

17:20.873 --> 17:23.138
The Sword of Yurikawa
can do a lot more damage

17:23.141 --> 17:25.175
than some measly explosive.

17:25.176 --> 17:27.545
If only I can get
my hands on it.

17:27.547 --> 17:29.546
Hey, boss,
look who's coming.

17:29.548 --> 17:30.914
It's the turtles.

17:30.916 --> 17:33.316
[Shredder]
What an incredible
stroke of luck!

17:33.318 --> 17:34.885
They got
the Sword of Yurikawa!

17:34.887 --> 17:36.453
So!

17:36.455 --> 17:37.688
We meet again!

17:37.690 --> 17:40.591
It's Shred Head and
the Gruesome Twosome!

17:40.593 --> 17:42.826
All right, Shellbacks!

17:42.828 --> 17:43.827
Hand over that sword!

17:43.829 --> 17:46.330
You want it?
Try and take it.

17:46.332 --> 17:48.665
Fire away!

17:48.667 --> 17:51.535
With the greatest
of pleasure.

17:55.139 --> 17:56.239
Hey!

17:58.042 --> 17:58.976
Whoa!

18:00.045 --> 18:01.378
[rumbling]

18:01.380 --> 18:04.081
[Le Drone]
Do not despair,
Monsieur Shredder!

18:04.083 --> 18:06.050
The cavalry has arrived!

18:06.052 --> 18:07.985
[Shredder]
What in blazes is that?

18:07.987 --> 18:09.887
It is I,<i> mon ami!</i>

18:09.889 --> 18:10.888
Lafayette Le Drone,

18:10.890 --> 18:12.890
your partner in crime!

18:19.330 --> 18:20.330
At last!

18:20.332 --> 18:22.933
The Sword of Yurikawa
is mine!

18:22.935 --> 18:24.301
Ah-ah-ah!

18:24.303 --> 18:27.137
But only temporarily,
Monsieur Shredder.

18:27.139 --> 18:28.939
Remember our agreement.

18:28.941 --> 18:30.641
[laughing]

18:30.643 --> 18:32.509
Of course,
<i>Monsieur Le Drone.</i>

18:32.511 --> 18:34.111
Temporarily.

18:34.113 --> 18:36.179
[Shredder]
You're finished, turtles!

18:36.181 --> 18:39.449
When the bridge goes down,
you go with it!

18:39.451 --> 18:42.119
[laughing]

18:42.121 --> 18:43.553
You know,
I can handle losing,

18:43.555 --> 18:45.956
but do we have to listen
to that stupid laugh?

18:45.958 --> 18:49.259
Heh, it's too bad you
guys won't be around

18:49.261 --> 18:52.596
when the boss'
army of mud mutants
takes over the city.

18:52.598 --> 18:54.531
Why just the city?

18:54.533 --> 18:56.700
With those mutants
and this sword,

18:56.702 --> 18:59.136
I can rule the world!

18:59.138 --> 19:02.305
<i>Will you forget</i>
<i>that ridiculous sword</i>

19:02.307 --> 19:03.974
<i>and rig the explosives?</i>

19:03.976 --> 19:06.276
I've told you before,
Krang,

19:06.278 --> 19:08.244
no explosive
on earth can match

19:08.246 --> 19:10.814
the destructive powers
of this sword!

19:10.816 --> 19:12.583
<i>Oh, all right!</i>

19:12.585 --> 19:14.050
<i>Take your new sword</i>

19:14.052 --> 19:16.720
<i>and prepare to destroy</i>
<i>the bridge!</i>

19:16.722 --> 19:20.491
<i>The truck convoy is due</i>
<i>to arrive at any moment.</i>

19:20.493 --> 19:21.992
[Shredder]
They're almost here,
Krang.

19:21.994 --> 19:24.595
Now you'll see
what this sword can do!

19:26.030 --> 19:27.831
<i>Sacré bleu.</i>

19:27.833 --> 19:29.032
A chainsaw.

19:29.034 --> 19:30.300
It will cut through
these girders

19:30.302 --> 19:32.869
like a hot knife
through butter!

19:32.871 --> 19:34.638
Watch closely,
turtles.

19:34.640 --> 19:36.940
This is the last thing
you will ever see!

19:38.043 --> 19:39.442
What in blazes?

19:41.011 --> 19:42.379
It's gone berserk!

19:42.381 --> 19:44.548
Looks like Shredder's
getting shredded.

19:46.217 --> 19:48.185
[clanking]

19:48.187 --> 19:51.955
Gee, I wonder how come
it turned on the boss.

19:51.957 --> 19:55.025
Mm, because it gots
more brains than us?

19:55.027 --> 19:56.593
I'll tell you why.

19:56.595 --> 19:59.295
Because this sword
was meant to be mine!

19:59.297 --> 20:02.466
Observe how a wise
general puts it to use.

20:06.904 --> 20:09.406
Now observe how a wise
general knows when to retreat!

20:13.645 --> 20:14.511
Bummer, dudes.

20:14.513 --> 20:16.780
There are only
two cables left.

20:16.782 --> 20:18.415
[Donatello]
If this bridge collapses,

20:18.417 --> 20:20.217
it'll be bad news
for the city.

20:20.219 --> 20:22.419
It won't be such great
news for us, either.

20:24.388 --> 20:27.524
Look. It's that
mystery ninja again.

20:27.526 --> 20:30.393
[Michelangelo]
And he's coming over to say hi.

20:30.395 --> 20:32.963
My guess is it's--
[gulp]-- bye-bye.

20:35.967 --> 20:37.734
Ooh!
Ouch!
Come on!

20:37.736 --> 20:39.302
Hey, look, pal,

20:39.304 --> 20:41.071
it's not like we're
ungrateful or anything,

20:41.073 --> 20:43.273
but just exactly
who are you?

20:43.275 --> 20:45.475
If you must know...

20:45.477 --> 20:46.643
[gasp]

20:46.645 --> 20:48.679
[all]
Master Splinter!

20:48.681 --> 20:51.882
I dislike deception,
my students.

20:51.884 --> 20:53.083
But it was my way

20:53.085 --> 20:54.484
of testing
your ninja spirit.

20:54.486 --> 20:56.519
[Shredder]
So, my ancient enemy,

20:56.521 --> 21:00.858
prepare to be annihilated
once and for all.

21:00.860 --> 21:03.160
We'll take care of him,
Master.

21:03.162 --> 21:05.062
No. You take care of them.

21:05.064 --> 21:08.398
Shredder and I have
an age-old score to settle.

21:08.400 --> 21:09.867
You heard him, fellas.

21:09.869 --> 21:11.268
Let's do it!

21:11.270 --> 21:15.438
Uh-uh. Those shellbacks
look real ticked off.

21:15.440 --> 21:18.274
Make way for us!

21:24.281 --> 21:26.282
Now what, Oroko Saki?

21:26.284 --> 21:27.951
Now this!

21:27.953 --> 21:29.619
A laser blaster?

21:29.621 --> 21:31.888
As our own sensei
taught us,

21:31.890 --> 21:34.223
in battle
one must improvise.

21:34.225 --> 21:36.626
Well, in that case...

21:43.601 --> 21:47.904
Yo, boss,
better climb on board.

21:47.906 --> 21:50.106
Any port
in the storm.

21:51.876 --> 21:53.710
Shredder and his goons
are getting away.

21:53.712 --> 21:55.378
Well, let's stop them.

21:55.380 --> 21:58.682
Forget them. The convoy is
about to cross the bridge.

22:00.384 --> 22:01.618
With those cables cut,

22:01.620 --> 22:02.953
it will never support
their weight.

22:02.955 --> 22:05.622
Then there is
only one solution.

22:09.527 --> 22:11.761
[Michelangelo]
All right! Way to go!

22:11.763 --> 22:13.363
Bodacious moves!

22:13.365 --> 22:15.832
Remember my words
about the sword:

22:15.834 --> 22:19.469
always changing,
yet always the same.

22:19.471 --> 22:21.938
Yet no one could control
it but you, Master.

22:23.474 --> 22:25.876
That is the secret
of the Sword of Yurikawa.

22:25.878 --> 22:28.712
It can only be used for good,

22:28.714 --> 22:32.482
and therein
lies its true power.

22:32.484 --> 22:34.784
<i>And so disaster</i>
<i>was avoided</i>

22:34.786 --> 22:37.821
<i>as the convoy safely</i>
<i>delivered it hazardous cargo</i>

22:37.823 --> 22:39.156
<i>for decontamination.</i>

22:39.158 --> 22:41.191
Just as you, my students,

22:41.193 --> 22:44.128
must now safely deliver
the Sword of Yurikawa

22:44.130 --> 22:45.562
to its rightful place.

22:45.564 --> 22:46.997
Don't worry, sensei.

22:46.999 --> 22:49.066
We'll take it straight
to the embassy.

22:49.068 --> 22:51.668
And this time, we won't
stop for pizza.

22:51.670 --> 22:53.871
Unless, of course,
it's a really great pizza.

22:53.873 --> 22:58.175
Uh, like one with guacamole
and marshmallow?

22:58.177 --> 23:00.043
What was that?

23:00.045 --> 23:01.711
Just kidding, sensei.
