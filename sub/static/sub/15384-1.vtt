I can't hear you.</i>

01:17.277 --> 01:20.144
<i>It's them bells!</i>

01:20.180 --> 01:22.876
<i>I've had them in my ears
for ten hours.</i>

01:22.916 --> 01:26.443
<i>Ding, dong, ding, dong.</i>

01:27.887 --> 01:30.549
<i>[man 2] Hey, sergeant.
Where's Major Lance?</i>

01:30.590 --> 01:33.559
<i>[man 3] We moved the CP back to
that stone building. The major's there.</i>

01:33.593 --> 01:35.356
<i>[man 2] Get him,
the colonel's here.</i>

01:36.963 --> 01:38.624

<i>[guns firing in distance]</i>

01:48.875 --> 01:51.241
<i>[man] Colonel! Am I glad to see you!</i>

01:51.277 --> 01:55.475
<i>[man 2] Those bodies...
Get those bodies down!</i>

01:55.515 --> 01:59.212
<i>- What are you doing? Get 'em down!
- Of course. Yes, sir.</i>

01:59.252 --> 02:02.415
<i>- We've been under fire...
- I know you have, but I don't care!</i>

02:02.455 --> 02:07.154
<i>Get 'em down! Down!
Don't want those boys left up there.</i>

02:07.193 --> 02:11.254
<i>We're gonna hold this town till
the linkup does come, whenever it is.</i>

02:18.505 --> 02:21.201
<i>- [man] Private?
- [man 2] Yes, sir.</i>

02:21.241 --> 02:24.369
<i>- [man] It's a hell of a war.
- [man 2] A privilege to serve with you.</i>

02:24.410 --> 02:29.040
<i>Well, God willing, we'll do
what we came here to do.</i>

02:29.082 --> 02:32.779
<i>- Ready, sir.
- Move out!</i>

02:35.155 --> 02:40.115
Pilgrim, we fought
for this country, too.

02:43.062 --> 02:44.825
Five postcard stamps, please.

02:46.399 --> 02:49.095
- Thank you. Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

Thank you so much.
Have a Merry Christmas.

Twenty-cent stamp, please.

03:14.527 --> 03:17.826
Excuse me, sir?

- Um, press.

04:13.419 --> 04:15.011
OK.

04:21.793 --> 04:24.786
- Are you Detective Ricci?
- That's my story.

04:24.831 --> 04:26.059
I heard about you.

04:26.099 --> 04:28.966
[grunts] Yeah, well,
you oughta change friends then.

04:29.002 --> 04:31.903
<i>I'm Tim Boyle. Daily News.</i>

04:31.938 --> 04:34.873
<i>- What happened?
- Read about it in the New York Post.</i>

04:34.907 --> 04:38.809
<i>They left here two hours ago along with
The Times, Newsday and every channel</i>

04:38.845 --> 04:42.804
you can get on TV with a wire hanger.
Ain't you ever heard of the early bird?

04:42.849 --> 04:45.716
- Christ.
- Go find a wailing wall.

04:45.752 --> 04:47.686
- I got lost.
- Comin' here?

04:47.720 --> 04:49.779
Find another way
for a dollar to change pockets.

04:49.822 --> 04:53.223
- It's my first day as a reporter.
- It's probably your last.

04:53.259 --> 04:55.921
Welcome to New York.
Be like Governor Rockefeller:

04:55.962 --> 04:58.658
- Come and go at the same time.
- Give me some angle.

04:58.698 --> 05:01.758
All I can give you
is an empty feeling, kid.

05:01.801 --> 05:04.929
The perp's over at Bellevue,
eighth floor peanut gallery.

05:04.971 --> 05:07.405
The victim's deader
than yesterday's beer.

05:07.440 --> 05:10.034
Heard he wasn't special
when he was breathing.

05:10.076 --> 05:13.534
My next job's gonna be stuffin'
ballot boxes on Staten Island.

05:13.579 --> 05:18.175
Remind me to vote. I live there.
Most cops do. Go home, kid.

05:18.217 --> 05:20.082
- Don't stop for bread.
- Come on.

05:20.119 --> 05:23.555
Gotta be something I can work.
Can I give you a tip on a hot horse?

05:23.589 --> 05:26.353
I'll play Santa at the PA
on Christmas Day. Or I'll...

05:26.392 --> 05:30.385
I'll pay Hong Kong Sue over on Forty
Deuce to blow your noodle like Satchmo.

05:30.430 --> 05:32.557
How about I put a story
in your hip pocket?

05:32.598 --> 05:34.691
"Good Cop Helps Poor Kids."

05:34.734 --> 05:38.465
Honest to Jesus, you get three months
of Saturdays out of it. Come on.

05:38.504 --> 05:40.972
I can't go back to scratching out obits.

05:43.009 --> 05:45.034
See those guys?
Don't turn around.

05:45.078 --> 05:49.174
They're rolling up to Harlem
to sniff around the perp's apartment.

05:49.215 --> 05:53.151
Only case that dynamic duo has cracked
has Schaefer written on the side,

05:53.186 --> 05:56.849
but maybe you'll see something.
Don't quote those gumflappers.

05:56.889 --> 05:58.720
- You need a quote, you call me.
- OK.

05:58.758 --> 06:01.249
- Haggerty, Dillard!
- Yeah, what's up?

06:01.294 --> 06:05.321
- Take this guy uptown with you.
- Thank you. Thank you.

06:05.365 --> 06:07.890
- Come on.
- All right.

06:19.178 --> 06:22.238
We'll start in the living room
and work our way back.

06:24.417 --> 06:26.510
Close the door behind you, kid.

06:49.108 --> 06:51.440
This perp is very, very religious.

06:51.477 --> 06:54.913
Nothing wrong with being
in good standing with the Lord.

06:59.852 --> 07:02.377
And a war hero, too.
Look at this, a Purple Heart.

07:02.422 --> 07:05.482
Hey, Keith, the Brown Bomber.

07:05.525 --> 07:09.359
[Keith] Muhammad Ali would've knocked
him out. Way too fast for Joe Louis.

07:09.395 --> 07:11.295
He can run, but he can't hide.

07:22.575 --> 07:25.203
Hey, Dan, what the hell is this?

07:25.244 --> 07:28.805
- [Dan] What you got there?
- I don't know. It's heavy.

07:28.848 --> 07:32.807
Whatever this is, it ain't junior-grade.
This thing looks expensive.

07:32.852 --> 07:38.620
My wife claws around flea markets
looking for this crap every weekend.

07:38.658 --> 07:40.523
I'm telling you, this ain't normal.

07:40.560 --> 07:42.255
This definitely ain't normal.

07:42.295 --> 07:45.162
- Back up, buddy.
- Sorry.

07:45.198 --> 07:46.722
[Keith] No problem.

07:46.766 --> 07:49.564
- Professor Brooks?
- Yes.

07:51.737 --> 07:56.572
I get a lot of these things.
Old rocks. Antique specials.

07:56.609 --> 07:59.510
It seems like every
schmuck in the world

07:59.545 --> 08:03.572
who finds a backyard arrowhead
mistakes me for Iris.

08:03.616 --> 08:05.049
Put it here.

08:05.084 --> 08:09.748
From Greek mythology.
She is the faithful voice of Zeus.

08:09.789 --> 08:14.453
She flies from place to place
and commands respect

08:14.494 --> 08:17.895
from mortals and from im...

08:19.799 --> 08:21.426
...immortals.

08:23.836 --> 08:26.964
- Where the hell'd you get this?
- From a perp's apartment.

08:27.006 --> 08:29.270
- It's got this mark...
- Don't touch it.

08:29.308 --> 08:35.008
This is over 450 years old.

08:35.047 --> 08:38.847
It's the missing Primavera
from the Santa Trinita.

08:38.885 --> 08:41.352
<i>Is that the Ni√±a, the Pinta
or the Santa Maria?</i>

08:41.386 --> 08:43.446
Oh, for God sakes, detective.

08:43.489 --> 08:46.481
It's the oldest elliptic

08:46.526 --> 08:49.893
arch bridge in the world.

08:49.929 --> 08:53.456
It's in Florence, Italy.

08:53.499 --> 08:55.763
Built by Ammanati.

08:55.801 --> 08:59.202
This was one of four statues on it.

08:59.238 --> 09:04.073
The Primavera, meaning "spring."

09:04.110 --> 09:05.941
This head has been missing

09:05.978 --> 09:10.608
since the Nazis blew up
the bridge in 1944.

09:10.650 --> 09:15.883
My God! This is a gold mine!

09:16.689 --> 09:18.680
A gold mine!

09:23.296 --> 09:24.820
Yo!

09:30.636 --> 09:32.501
[elevator dings]

09:43.716 --> 09:47.482
Merry Christmas. From Tim Boyle.

09:47.520 --> 09:49.613
Oh, wise guy.

10:18.417 --> 10:20.612
[Tim] Mr. Hector Negron?

10:32.898 --> 10:34.991
[children shouting]

10:55.054 --> 10:57.454
[in Italian]
Darling, come back to bed.

10:57.490 --> 10:58.980
Please. Enough.

10:59.025 --> 11:01.687
I need a little break, OK, baby?

11:07.199 --> 11:10.100
[Tim] They say you haven't
spoken or eaten in two days.

11:10.136 --> 11:13.162
They'll try to force-feed you.

11:13.205 --> 11:15.503
Make you rise, like Jesus.

11:21.981 --> 11:24.950
Come on. I've hiked all over
New York asking about you.

11:24.984 --> 11:27.782
I talked to everybody.
Cops, your sister.

11:27.820 --> 11:31.381
Spoke to your cousin in San Juan.
You're clean as a board of health.

11:31.424 --> 11:34.086
You got no kids, no debts, no enemies.

11:34.126 --> 11:36.253
Four years in the service. Purple Heart.

11:36.295 --> 11:38.661
Twenty-five years
of a great marriage,

11:38.698 --> 11:41.963
till your wife's heart gave out.

11:43.569 --> 11:47.562
So why you stick a German Luger
in a guy's chest

11:47.606 --> 11:51.940
three months short of your retirement?
Five million dollars.

11:51.977 --> 11:54.946
That's how much that head would
draw on the black market.

11:54.980 --> 11:58.677
What's it doin' buried there
on the bottom of your closet?

12:06.525 --> 12:08.925
You're looking at 25 to life, pal.

12:08.961 --> 12:12.453
Unless you can afford a lawyer,
you're gonna swallow happy pills

12:12.498 --> 12:15.296
in this nuthouse the rest of your life.

12:15.334 --> 12:20.101
But my story could help you.
And you need help, mac.

12:24.510 --> 12:29.106
[woman, in Italian] Enrico, what kind
of art dealer specializes in Nazi art?

12:29.148 --> 12:31.981
Because it's a lucrative business.

12:34.220 --> 12:37.189
[in Italian] You Americans love work
more than you love 'love.'

12:37.223 --> 12:38.383
[groans]

12:39.859 --> 12:42.794
[in Italian] My love,
are you ignoring me?

12:44.597 --> 12:46.394
[Keith] Pina, no.
Don't come over here.

12:49.668 --> 12:52.102
[in Italian] Enrico, you said
you only needed ten minutes.

12:52.138 --> 12:55.005
I gotta catch up. World might've
ended, I wouldn't know

12:55.040 --> 12:58.237
'cause we've been going at it
two days. For crying out loud.

12:58.277 --> 13:00.245
[in Italian] The world is still here.

13:00.279 --> 13:01.610
You and I are still here.

13:01.647 --> 13:03.342
Baby, not right now.

13:04.450 --> 13:06.975
There you go. Excuse me.

13:08.154 --> 13:09.621
OK?

13:11.924 --> 13:14.654
Oh, God. Oh, that feels good.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.493
[Pina giggling]

13:19.698 --> 13:21.165
You're killing me, baby.

13:21.200 --> 13:23.361
[in Italian] Yes, I love you to death.

13:56.302 --> 13:58.031
[sighs]

14:15.554 --> 14:17.454
I...

14:18.891 --> 14:21.883
Hmm? What is it, Mr. Negron?

14:24.697 --> 14:26.130
I... I know.

14:27.766 --> 14:28.892
You know what?

14:34.840 --> 14:37.400
I know who the sleeping man is!

14:37.443 --> 14:41.846
- [Tim] You know what?
- I know who the sleeping man is.

14:41.881 --> 14:45.476
[bells tolling]

14:45.517 --> 14:48.918
[child yelling in Italian]

15:47.913 --> 15:51.940
[man whimpering]
Mama. I want mama.

16:15.274 --> 16:18.710
Kill me now! Kill me now,
I wanna go home to my mama!

16:18.744 --> 16:22.111
I don't wanna be here.
I wanna go home!

16:22.147 --> 16:25.378
Kill me now! Kill me now!

16:25.417 --> 16:29.547
Oh, Jesus, I want my mama!
I don't wanna die! I don't wanna die!

16:29.588 --> 16:30.680
Shh!

16:30.723 --> 16:34.386
- Hector, shut him the fuck up.
- Yes, sir.

16:34.426 --> 16:37.418
- I don't wanna die!
- Shut the fuck up!

16:37.463 --> 16:42.230
[whispering] You wanna get us all
killed? That's your mama right now.

16:42.267 --> 16:45.361
- This far enough?
- Keep movin'.

16:45.404 --> 16:50.637
- You doin' fine, big fella.
- Help me, Lord. Help me, Lord.

16:50.676 --> 16:53.474
Help me, Lord,
I'm prepared for Thee.

16:53.512 --> 16:56.879
- Get off of me, sniper bait!
- Bishop, Train, switch flanks.

16:56.915 --> 16:59.247
Bishop, take outer.
Train, take the inner.

16:59.284 --> 17:01.081
- What's that?
- Take inner flank.

17:01.120 --> 17:03.680
- What's that?
- Come on. Switch places, dummy.

17:03.722 --> 17:05.212
Gimme some room.

17:09.161 --> 17:12.324
Hey, Bishop.
Why we got to cross this river?

17:12.364 --> 17:14.627
They sellin' hoecakes
and beer on the other side.

17:14.665 --> 17:15.758
[laughs]

17:18.804 --> 17:22.262
- My good luck charm gives me strength.
- Piece of shit you found

17:22.307 --> 17:24.468
in the gutter in Florence?

17:24.510 --> 17:27.502
Couldn't draw a bowl of turtle soup
from Uncle Amos with that.

17:27.546 --> 17:28.911
Worth more than a bowl of soup!

17:28.947 --> 17:30.847
Shh!

17:30.883 --> 17:32.851
Train.

17:32.885 --> 17:36.753
Hector, you speak Italian.
Cut-off head worth somethin'?

17:36.789 --> 17:39.724
<i>- Yo speaky Puerto Rican, man.
- Hey, muzzle that.</i>

17:39.758 --> 17:41.225
Keep moving.

18:51.730 --> 18:53.163
[man speaks German]

18:53.198 --> 18:56.895
<i>[man on radio] Germany calling,
Germany calling.</i>

18:56.935 --> 18:59.768
<i>Guten morgen, 92nd Division.</i>

18:59.805 --> 19:03.707
Buffalo soldiers, welcome to the war.

19:03.742 --> 19:07.508
<i>[woman on loudspeaker]
We've been waiting for you.</i>

19:07.546 --> 19:11.676
<i>Do you know our German Wehrmacht
has been here digging bunkers</i>

19:11.717 --> 19:15.619
<i>for six months on the Gothic Line?
Waiting.</i>

19:15.654 --> 19:20.591
<i>Your white commanders
won't tell you that, of course.</i>

19:20.626 --> 19:25.620
<i>Why? Because they
don't care if you die.</i>

19:25.664 --> 19:26.722
[whimpering]

19:26.765 --> 19:30.292
<i>But the German people have
nothing against the Negro.</i>

19:30.335 --> 19:34.271
That's why I'm warning you now,
with all my heart and soul.

19:34.306 --> 19:36.968
Save yourself, Negro brothers.

19:37.009 --> 19:40.308
<i>Why die for a nation
that doesn't want you?</i>

19:40.345 --> 19:44.645
<i>A nation that treats you like a slave.</i>

19:44.683 --> 19:46.150
<i>Did I say slave?</i>

19:46.185 --> 19:48.983
Yes, I did.

19:49.021 --> 19:52.286
[speaking German]
Why don't they shut her up?

19:52.324 --> 19:54.155
What is she saying?

19:54.193 --> 19:57.219
Berlin can afford to pipe
that garbage all the way here

19:57.262 --> 19:59.321
but can't give us potato soup.

20:01.867 --> 20:04.427
Individual guns only, on my command.

20:06.171 --> 20:09.629
We have enough ammo
for an hour, maybe two.

20:09.675 --> 20:11.870
<i>[woman] Look around you.</i>

20:11.910 --> 20:15.846

41:51.775 --> 41:54.573
- You told me to!
- I didn't tell you to get us killed.

41:56.480 --> 42:00.746
This uniform don't change nothing for
us. This is a white man's war, Train.

42:00.784 --> 42:05.517
Negroes ain't got nothing to do with
this. This boy ain't got no life nohow.

42:05.556 --> 42:08.650
Why he don't? Hmm?

42:08.692 --> 42:12.753
A life of goodness is not what these
white folk has chosen for they children.

42:12.796 --> 42:15.026
Look at me.

42:16.834 --> 42:20.964
Good book says it, Proverbs 22:16.

42:21.005 --> 42:26.033
"Raise up a child the way you want him
to go, and he will not depart from it."

42:26.076 --> 42:28.044
Now, he's trained to hate.

42:29.980 --> 42:33.279
Shit, his life ain't worth
a dollar of Chinese money.

42:33.317 --> 42:36.013
Listen here, Bishop.

42:36.053 --> 42:39.250
This boy ain't done nothing to you.

42:39.290 --> 42:41.087
Mm-hm.

42:41.125 --> 42:43.821
You didn't want him before, did you?

42:48.966 --> 42:52.527
- Where you goin', Sam Train?
- Hey, Stamps, we movin' or not?

42:57.241 --> 43:00.404
We hold here till night.
Me and Bishop'll take first watch.

43:00.444 --> 43:04.278
Hector, you and Train take second.
Give the boy whatever first aid you got.

43:13.958 --> 43:17.553
What'd you get us into now, Diesel?

43:17.595 --> 43:22.259
It's always something with you,
big fella. Here, you gonna need these.

43:22.299 --> 43:24.733
Come on, kid.
[speaks Italian] Eat.

43:24.768 --> 43:26.167
Eat.

43:27.171 --> 43:29.162
Come on.

43:29.206 --> 43:31.003
He won't take the medicine.

43:37.748 --> 43:39.807
Go on, give it here.

43:39.850 --> 43:42.216
You want some chocolate, boy?

43:45.322 --> 43:48.257
I wouldn't get attached.
He'll be dead in a week.

43:48.292 --> 43:53.252
I ain't never been this close
to a white person before, Hec.

43:53.297 --> 43:56.528
Never even touched one.
Not even a dead one.

43:56.567 --> 43:59.934
If this one dies, I'll give you
a whistle as a consolation prize.

43:59.970 --> 44:02.962
- You really think he'll die?
- Why worry about it?

44:03.007 --> 44:04.998
We could all be dead
in an hour anyway.

44:11.949 --> 44:13.974
Why you always kissing that thing, Hec?

44:14.018 --> 44:18.853
- Reminds me who my father is.
- I don't need help remembering my pa.

44:18.889 --> 44:22.518
His name's Chester.
Chester Train.

44:22.559 --> 44:24.390
Let's give this kid some water.

44:28.766 --> 44:29.790
[in Italian] Water.

44:33.937 --> 44:34.995
Arturo?

44:35.939 --> 44:38.271
Can I ask you something?

44:38.308 --> 44:39.707
What you want, boy?

44:39.743 --> 44:41.643
[in Italian] Can you tell me who I am?

44:42.846 --> 44:45.781
Hector, you speak that Italian?
What's he saying?

44:45.816 --> 44:48.284
He said, "Who am I?"
But who's he talking to?

44:48.318 --> 44:50.343
Lord, I knew it!

44:50.387 --> 44:53.083
I could see it in his face!
Look at him, Hec.

44:53.123 --> 44:54.920
Shh! Quiet down.

44:54.958 --> 44:57.426
Good God!

44:57.461 --> 44:59.361
- He got the power!
- What power?

44:59.396 --> 45:03.423
God knows it. In the olden days,
everything could speak.

45:03.467 --> 45:05.867
- The trees, the birds.
- Shh!

45:05.903 --> 45:10.101
If you could hear them things,
then that mean you had it.

45:13.644 --> 45:18.308
This boy's standing
in the shadow of God, Hector.

45:18.348 --> 45:22.478
Thank you, Jesus! Thank you for standing
on Your holy righteous word, Lord!

45:22.519 --> 45:25.283
Hallelujah! Thank you, Jesus!

45:45.409 --> 45:46.967
As you were.

46:14.371 --> 46:18.000
- General Almond.
- Colonel.

46:18.041 --> 46:20.874
I have a photo you should see, sir.

46:20.911 --> 46:25.007
Forget that a minute. How bad
are the numbers from yesterday?

46:25.048 --> 46:27.642
- Bad, sir.
- And lke gets mad when he gives me

46:27.684 --> 46:30.517
waiters and shoeshine boys
to fight the Krauts with.

46:30.554 --> 46:33.580
Germans are dug in.
And that gun at La Spezia's killing us.

46:33.624 --> 46:38.084
Fifteen thousand colored soldiers.
One in four is a casualty.

46:38.128 --> 46:41.222
And all I'm hearing about
is one goddamned gun?

46:41.265 --> 46:45.167
We have guns, too, here.
Look, see, colonel? I got one.

46:45.202 --> 46:49.832
This colored division...
This is an experiment, Jack.

46:49.873 --> 46:54.936
An experiment. These are the first lady
Eleanor Roosevelt's niggers. Not ours.

46:54.978 --> 46:59.847
- Sir, I respectfully disagree.
- That's why they sent you here, Jack.

46:59.883 --> 47:02.647
To lead me into the New World.

47:04.354 --> 47:08.120
A gift from the Brits.
Taken at 11,000 feet. See?

47:08.158 --> 47:11.650
That's a German buildup at
Lama Di Sotto. Two or three regiments.

47:11.695 --> 47:14.630
- Surprise attack you worried about?
- I hope not.

47:14.665 --> 47:16.462
I got corroboration from a partisan.

47:16.500 --> 47:18.991
Anybody crush grapes
with feet can't be trusted.

47:19.036 --> 47:20.936
Get some Krauts to confirm.

47:20.971 --> 47:23.735
Already working on it, sir.
Captain Rudden!

47:27.077 --> 47:30.672
- Good evening, general.
- Come.

47:30.714 --> 47:34.411
Germans may be planning counter-
offensive down the Serchio Valley.

47:34.451 --> 47:37.443
We need a POW to confirm.
You running patrols there?

47:37.487 --> 47:40.320
George Company has a squad
sitting right in that area.

47:40.357 --> 47:42.621
- How?
- They pushed across the Serchio

47:42.659 --> 47:46.356
beyond Hill Maine at the weak point.
I heard them call for artillery.

47:46.396 --> 47:50.594
Might've broken Jerry's hold
on the river. Captain Nokes didn't fire.

47:50.634 --> 47:53.398
- Why not?
- He couldn't see 'em, sir.

47:53.437 --> 47:55.871
Didn't believe they crossed,
they got hung up.

47:55.906 --> 47:59.342
I had Fox Company positioned
down the river from George Company.

47:59.376 --> 48:02.345
Got pretty hot over there.
Four of 'em right up a mountain.

48:02.379 --> 48:04.609
Got weapons and a radio
if they're alive.

48:04.648 --> 48:07.378
- Who are the four men?
- Shouldn't be hard to find out.

48:07.417 --> 48:09.885
One of them's the biggest Negro
you've ever seen in your life.

48:09.920 --> 48:11.945
Mmm.

48:11.989 --> 48:15.083
Very well then. Dismissed.

48:22.032 --> 48:24.500
[door shuts]

49:19.957 --> 49:22.289
[speaking German]
My God, I've had it.

49:22.326 --> 49:23.850
Come on, it's enough.

49:24.995 --> 49:26.019
Yeah, let's go.

49:27.831 --> 49:29.298
I need something to eat.

49:30.634 --> 49:34.695
[speaking Italian]
The Germans are leaving!

49:35.839 --> 49:38.637
[bell tolling]

49:44.448 --> 49:48.111
[speaking German] Push it up
or I'll kill it right now.

49:48.151 --> 49:49.982
I'm pushing as hard
as I can.

49:50.020 --> 49:51.749
Pull, pull, pull.

49:51.788 --> 49:54.689
My goodness I'm hungry.

49:54.725 --> 49:58.991
Finally something to chew on,
rather than the slime they feed us.

50:02.933 --> 50:05.231
[in Italian] Goodbye meat.
Now there'll be nothing left.

50:05.268 --> 50:07.634
They won't get fat on it.

50:07.671 --> 50:09.229
Let's hope they choke on it.

50:09.272 --> 50:11.832
Shut up, the two of you!

50:11.875 --> 50:15.140
Now, let's see if your husband
will come back from Russia.

50:22.853 --> 50:24.320
Mary, Joseph, Jesus,

50:24.354 --> 50:27.118
tell us if we'll see him
or never see him again.

50:27.157 --> 50:28.647
Is he still alive?

50:28.692 --> 50:30.660
My eyes aren't
what they used to be.

50:30.694 --> 50:32.992
- [rattling table]
- Come on!

50:33.030 --> 50:34.327
So, so, so?

50:34.364 --> 50:37.697
We can't even joke? Come on.

50:39.102 --> 50:41.127
That thing is just a stupid kid's game.

50:41.171 --> 50:43.196
You're the usual scoundrel!

50:43.240 --> 50:45.640
Just because he carries
the Fascist Party card,

50:45.675 --> 50:46.699
he thinks he can do what he wants.

50:46.743 --> 50:48.210
Oh yes?

50:48.245 --> 50:51.612
Then who was it who took butter
from the Germans the other day?

50:51.648 --> 50:52.740
The Pope?

50:52.783 --> 50:54.842
Maybe, because it wasn't us.

50:54.885 --> 50:56.182
And the light?

50:56.219 --> 50:57.777
How did your electricity come back on?

50:57.821 --> 50:58.981
Papa.

50:59.022 --> 51:00.182
Come with me.

51:00.223 --> 51:01.247
Come with me.

51:02.225 --> 51:03.783
How did the light come back on?

51:03.827 --> 51:06.660
The truth will never
come out of his mouth.

51:16.139 --> 51:18.300
You would think that
after all these years,

51:18.341 --> 51:20.969
you would treat your friends better.

51:21.011 --> 51:23.377
What is wrong with you, Papa?

51:23.413 --> 51:24.505
Would you tell me?

51:28.952 --> 51:30.681
It's Natalina.

51:30.720 --> 51:32.153
What did she do?

51:32.189 --> 51:34.054
She put the evil eye on me, that Witch.

51:34.091 --> 51:36.423
You still going on about the same story?

51:36.460 --> 51:39.691
The Germans stole your rabbits, not her.

51:41.231 --> 51:44.098
There's strange things going on.

51:44.134 --> 51:46.602
My electricity returned...

51:46.636 --> 51:48.536
from God knows where
after two and a half years.

51:48.572 --> 51:50.233
I was going to ask you about that.

51:50.273 --> 51:53.970
Now I'm lit up like a carnival...

51:54.010 --> 51:57.741
for every bandit and German to see.

51:57.781 --> 52:01.444
It's Natalina's fault. She wants to see
me dead and buried behind the Church.

52:01.485 --> 52:02.884
What are you talking about?

52:04.654 --> 52:06.451
She prays for you every day.

52:08.625 --> 52:09.853
Know what I say?

52:11.061 --> 52:16.158
You go back in there
and apologize to your friends.

52:16.199 --> 52:18.531
Tell everyone that
Mussolini disgusts you,

52:18.568 --> 52:21.298
and that you are not a Fascist anymore.

52:21.338 --> 52:25.502
Il Duce made us a world power again.

52:25.542 --> 52:28.375
His only mistake was to get in bed
with that imbecile Hitler.

52:28.411 --> 52:30.971
Papa, II Duce betrayed Italy.

52:31.014 --> 52:33.778
And now you'll see
how this is going to end.

52:33.817 --> 52:36.115
You are still so young, my child.

52:36.153 --> 52:38.053
You don't know the ways of the world.

52:38.088 --> 52:40.579
But you will learn.

52:40.624 --> 52:42.717
And from whom?

52:42.759 --> 52:44.090
From a Fascist like you?

52:45.095 --> 52:47.222
You're just like your mother.

52:47.264 --> 52:48.993
And she used to tell you
that Blackshirts

52:49.032 --> 52:50.932
are only good for hiding dirt.

52:50.967 --> 52:52.127
Okay, let's go.

52:56.173 --> 52:57.868
[knocking on door]

52:59.309 --> 53:00.674
Germans!!!

53:02.379 --> 53:03.471
It's your house.

53:14.357 --> 53:15.483
Holy Mother of God.

53:23.233 --> 53:24.564
It's okay.

53:24.601 --> 53:26.569
It's okay.

53:26.603 --> 53:27.695
It's okay, it's okay.

53:30.974 --> 53:33.602
Hector, ask who's in charge.
Tell them we're Americans.

53:37.714 --> 53:39.204
[in Italian] Americans?

53:39.249 --> 53:41.274
[in English] Me, too. Half.

53:41.318 --> 53:42.580
[in Italian] Half.

53:42.619 --> 53:45.213
[in English] Me sister Ida, half.

53:45.255 --> 53:48.019
[in Italian] We called her little Ida,
because she was the baby.

53:48.058 --> 53:50.322
Put us together,
we make one American.

53:50.360 --> 53:51.793
[in Italian] Okay, wait. Wait.

53:51.828 --> 53:54.695
Wait. Wait. Wait.

53:54.731 --> 53:55.959
Thank you.

53:55.999 --> 53:57.261
Who's in charge here?

54:09.145 --> 54:11.613
Anybody here speak English?

54:14.150 --> 54:15.412
[in Italian]
Where are the Germans?

54:15.452 --> 54:18.683
Everywhere. Boom, boom.

54:18.722 --> 54:21.452
My name is Renata.

54:23.360 --> 54:28.263
- Where'd you learn English?
- I was nanny for a British family.

54:28.298 --> 54:32.860
And a jolly good tuck-in-the-bed
tinkerer you must be.

54:32.902 --> 54:36.838
- You can nanny me. Want a Camel?
- Cool it, Bishop.

54:36.873 --> 54:41.037
I'm Staff Sergeant Aubrey Stamps.
We got a boy that needs help.

54:41.077 --> 54:42.806
[in Italian]
A boy? He has a boy.

54:45.015 --> 54:46.505
Oh, my God.

54:47.484 --> 54:49.577
Is he alive? Put him here.

54:49.619 --> 54:51.211
Slow. Slowly.

54:53.323 --> 54:55.052
Where did you find him?

54:55.091 --> 54:57.286
[Hector] On the Mountain.
Do you know him?

54:57.327 --> 54:59.386
[Natalina]
No, I don't know him.

54:59.429 --> 55:01.897
But he can stay here
until he gets better.

55:01.931 --> 55:05.128
Tell them we're taking the boy
to a hospital. They can come.

55:05.168 --> 55:08.399
They need to evacuate.
We'll escort them down the mountain.

55:08.438 --> 55:11.202
[in Italian] We're going to a hospital.
You can come with us.

55:12.075 --> 55:14.134
The hospital around the corner?

55:14.177 --> 55:16.372
The Germans are everywhere.

55:16.413 --> 55:18.438
Torrite, Rontano, Mezzana.

55:18.481 --> 55:20.949
All the way to Barga
and down to the Serchio.

55:20.984 --> 55:23.782
I don't know how you
got past Vergemoli.

55:23.820 --> 55:27.483
The only way to Pietrasanta...

55:27.524 --> 55:29.185
where the Americans might be...

55:29.225 --> 55:30.749
is over that way,

55:31.761 --> 55:33.786
over the Mountain of the Sleeping Man.

55:35.031 --> 55:36.259
Says we're surrounded.

55:36.299 --> 55:38.460
Doesn't know how we got
past German lines,

55:38.501 --> 55:41.732
but the only way we might find
some Americans is up there.

55:41.771 --> 55:44.137
- The Mountain of the Sleeping Man.
- Sleeping Man?

55:44.174 --> 55:47.575
- [in Italian] What is that?
- It's a legend.

55:47.610 --> 55:53.571
A shepherd fell in love with a girl
who would not love him back.

55:53.616 --> 55:56.312
So he lays across the Mountain...

55:56.353 --> 55:58.753
to protect her from the wind and rain.

55:58.788 --> 56:02.986
He still lies there today,
to protect us all.

56:03.026 --> 56:07.395
Legend has it that
one day he will awaken.

56:10.166 --> 56:12.726
A legend about a shepherd
that fell in love...

56:12.769 --> 56:15.067
Whatever she's saying,
we gotta rest until sunup.

56:15.105 --> 56:17.369
- OK.
- Stay here? No, no.

56:17.407 --> 56:19.136
<i>Stay here. Si, si.</i>

56:19.175 --> 56:22.167
If they sing to the Krauts,
we will pull a trigger on this

56:22.212 --> 56:26.046
and tell the hammer to hurry. Won't be
nothing but powder and steel here.

56:26.082 --> 56:29.643
We are not Germans.
We are Italians.

56:29.686 --> 56:32.052
- Full blood.
- And what are we? Half blood?

56:34.657 --> 56:36.955
[in Italian]
We should take him...

56:36.993 --> 56:38.722
and put him to bed.

56:38.762 --> 56:41.993
The boy stays here. He's sick.

56:59.082 --> 57:00.549
<i>Heil Hitler!</i>

57:30.079 --> 57:32.809
[in German]
Catching up on your reading?

57:32.849 --> 57:35.977
Yes, Colonel, I'm informing myself
about the enemy.

57:36.019 --> 57:40.353
The Partisans often take their names
from banned poetry and literature.

57:40.390 --> 57:42.358
This helps us identify them.

57:42.392 --> 57:44.587
Who is the poet?

57:44.627 --> 57:46.356
Giovanni Pascoli.

57:46.396 --> 57:51.857
Do you think it's appropriate
to waste your time reading poetry?

57:51.901 --> 57:57.771
In the past nine months we've seen
a sharp rise in Partisan activity.

57:57.807 --> 58:00.105
What are you planning to do about it?

58:00.143 --> 58:04.204
Colonel, we are down
to shovels and mule shit.

58:04.247 --> 58:05.714
My men are exhausted.

58:05.748 --> 58:07.943
We need ammo and food.

58:07.984 --> 58:10.612
Food? You want food?

58:10.653 --> 58:13.349
You can suck icicles
in Russia...

58:13.389 --> 58:18.725
like you did before your so-called
neck wound brought you back here.

58:18.761 --> 58:22.322
You think you're the first
to command hungry troops?

58:22.365 --> 58:25.528
I mean no disrespect, Colonel.

58:27.203 --> 58:30.502
Good. Listen closely.

58:30.540 --> 58:33.407
I have come too far to repeat myself.

58:33.443 --> 58:37.709
First, there is a peasant, a terrorist.

58:37.747 --> 58:42.480
Named The Great Butterfly.
He's causing many problems.

58:42.519 --> 58:45.147
He's hiding in these mountains.
Find him.

58:45.188 --> 58:48.453
When he is found,
issue Directive Bandenbefehl...

58:48.491 --> 58:51.153
to him and his criminal friends.

58:51.194 --> 58:52.252
Bandenbefehl?

58:52.295 --> 58:54.923
Is there an echo out here?

58:54.964 --> 58:59.094
General Kesselring's standing
field order for the Italian Republic.

58:59.135 --> 59:01.626
At a commander's sole discretion,

59:01.671 --> 59:04.469
for every one German soldier killed,

59:04.507 --> 59:06.873
we execute ten Italian civilians.

59:06.910 --> 59:12.439
You should have been capable to execute
that order at least once in nine months.

59:12.482 --> 59:16.111
Colonel, with all due respect,
if I execute this order...

59:16.152 --> 59:18.677
my men would kill innocent civilians.

59:18.721 --> 59:22.350
It would be a violation
of the Geneva Convention.

59:22.392 --> 59:27.159
Partisans are not civilians;
they are terrorists.

59:27.196 --> 59:30.131
They are not protected
under the Geneva Convention.

59:30.166 --> 59:32.532
Bandenbefehl!

59:32.569 --> 59:33.729
Bandenbefehl.

59:36.072 --> 59:39.439
Secondly, the surprise
counterattack is still planned.

59:39.475 --> 59:43.969
I will tighten supply lines
with food and ammunition.

59:44.013 --> 59:46.311
And three:

59:46.349 --> 59:50.217
A delicate intelligence matter
of the utmost priority.

59:56.159 --> 59:59.026
We are missing a Corporal...

59:59.062 --> 01:00:02.691
from the 35th Regiment,
2nd Battalion, 5th Company.

01:00:02.732 --> 01:00:06.725
Name: Hans Brandt,
gone AWOL three weeks ago.

01:00:06.769 --> 01:00:09.738
[Eichholz] We have some every day.
What's so special about him?

01:00:10.673 --> 01:00:13.141
You and I are not here...

01:00:13.176 --> 01:00:17.010
to question the F√ºhrer's orders.

01:00:17.046 --> 01:00:19.606
You are to send out a search party.

01:00:19.649 --> 01:00:21.139
Find him.

01:00:21.184 --> 01:00:22.879
Don't let him escape.

01:00:22.919 --> 01:00:24.910
And when you have him...

01:00:25.955 --> 01:00:28.822
get word to me immediately.

01:00:37.967 --> 01:00:39.696
Let's go!

01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:54.275
<i>[in Italian] If I am no longer
that lamp...</i>

01:00:54.317 --> 01:00:57.115
<i>which flickers in front
of a sweet Maria.</i>

01:00:57.153 --> 01:00:58.620
[in German] What does that mean?

01:00:59.856 --> 01:01:01.653
God help this poor bastard Brandt.

01:01:02.525 --> 01:01:03.924
Whatever he's done,

01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:06.827
it's no worse than what anyone else
has done in this war.

01:01:07.563 --> 01:01:08.928
Mount a search party.

01:01:08.965 --> 01:01:10.956
We have to find him first,

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.992
hold him and give him a few days...

01:01:14.037 --> 01:01:17.131
before Pflueger pulls out
his teeth, one by one.

01:01:17.173 --> 01:01:18.197
Yes.

01:01:18.641 --> 01:01:21.007
I'll be relieved when this war is over.

01:01:21.044 --> 01:01:22.909
I want to return to my family.

01:01:51.941 --> 01:01:54.136
[in Italian]
I've watched you grow up.

01:01:54.177 --> 01:01:56.441
But you haven't become much.

01:01:56.479 --> 01:01:57.946
And he can't do much.

01:01:57.980 --> 01:01:59.845
- You're laughing at me?
- Of course.

01:01:59.882 --> 01:02:02.350
Where did you get that?

01:02:02.385 --> 01:02:03.875
So many things you want to know.

01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:05.012
Here. Take it and eat.

01:02:05.054 --> 01:02:06.385
Give me some, too.

01:02:06.422 --> 01:02:08.686
Are you afraid you're
not going to get any?

01:02:08.725 --> 01:02:09.885
Here. Grow.

01:02:09.926 --> 01:02:11.553
Give me a chestnut, too.

01:02:13.229 --> 01:02:15.026
My goodness, you stink like a sheep.

01:02:15.064 --> 01:02:16.725
Hey, leave me alone.

01:02:16.766 --> 01:02:18.700
Aren't you the dandy?

01:02:18.735 --> 01:02:20.498
Ah, he's offended.

01:02:25.875 --> 01:02:28.503
What the fuck are you doing, Peppi?

01:02:28.544 --> 01:02:30.239
You have to be on the lookout.

01:02:30.279 --> 01:02:33.510
If I had been a German,
you would all be dead... 1, 2, 3.

01:02:33.549 --> 01:02:35.176
I almost choked.

01:02:36.219 --> 01:02:37.846
You wait here.

01:02:53.069 --> 01:02:54.331
My friend.

01:02:54.370 --> 01:02:56.634
The Americans are getting closer.

01:02:57.907 --> 01:02:59.898
We have to warn them about
the Germans' counterattack.

01:02:59.942 --> 01:03:02.069
They know it already, for sure.

01:03:03.146 --> 01:03:05.171
You? How are you?

01:03:05.214 --> 01:03:07.444
Me? I'm okay.

01:03:07.483 --> 01:03:08.541
You?

01:03:08.584 --> 01:03:11.075
I always have Marco's
face in front of my eyes.

01:03:14.423 --> 01:03:15.651
Don't worry about that.

01:03:15.691 --> 01:03:20.924
My brother is dead.
Nobody cares about him any more.

01:03:20.963 --> 01:03:22.089
I care.

01:03:22.131 --> 01:03:23.530
In your opinion...

01:03:24.433 --> 01:03:25.832
when we will be in front of God,

01:03:25.868 --> 01:03:28.701
if we ever get there,

01:03:28.738 --> 01:03:31.707
is he going to ask us
for our political card?

01:03:31.741 --> 01:03:34.710
Is he going to say,
"Marco, no... Ludovico, no.

01:03:34.744 --> 01:03:38.236
You're not allowed in
because you're Fascists."

01:03:38.281 --> 01:03:42.877
What's the difference between
us and them in the eyes of God?

01:03:42.919 --> 01:03:45.183
You're asking yourself
too many questions.

01:03:45.221 --> 01:03:48.816
If you think too much,
it will drive you crazy.

01:03:48.858 --> 01:03:51.452
And then who will kill the Germans?

01:03:51.494 --> 01:03:52.518
Hey.

01:03:54.764 --> 01:03:57.164
Anyway, what's done is done.

01:04:05.007 --> 01:04:09.307
George Company to 370,
George Company to 3-7, over.

01:04:13.649 --> 01:04:16.243
George Company to 370, over.

01:04:40.042 --> 01:04:42.738
[in Italian] Someone tell that
big beast to get out of my room.

01:04:42.778 --> 01:04:45.838
Shh! The Boy has a fever.

01:04:45.882 --> 01:04:48.510
He needs to eat and get some rest.

01:04:48.551 --> 01:04:50.542
Try thinking of others
every once in awhile.

01:05:00.463 --> 01:05:01.760
Arturo.

01:05:02.832 --> 01:05:05.300
The Chocolate Giant's Castle...

01:05:05.334 --> 01:05:07.165
if you could only see it.

01:05:07.203 --> 01:05:09.694
It's enormous.

01:05:09.739 --> 01:05:11.900
No, even bigger.

01:05:12.742 --> 01:05:15.302
Of course I saw it.

01:05:15.344 --> 01:05:17.471
It's all made of chocolate.

01:05:17.513 --> 01:05:19.481
You break a piece off,

01:05:19.515 --> 01:05:21.312
and it grows back.

01:05:23.452 --> 01:05:25.716
Yes, I did save a piece for you.

01:05:33.195 --> 01:05:34.685
Good heavens.

01:05:34.730 --> 01:05:36.220
Something's not right.

01:05:36.265 --> 01:05:37.664
Someone put the evil eye on him.

01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:39.998
Bewitched or not, he's got to go.

01:05:40.036 --> 01:05:42.869
- To where?
- With the Americans.

01:05:42.905 --> 01:05:44.566
I think he brings good luck.
The Boy stays.

01:05:44.607 --> 01:05:46.234
This is my house.

01:05:46.275 --> 01:05:47.640
I have a house too.

01:05:48.611 --> 01:05:50.010
Natalina.

01:05:50.046 --> 01:05:51.536
What do you think?

01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:54.640
I say this Boy is talking to the Devil.

01:05:54.684 --> 01:05:56.208
We need a Priest here.

01:05:56.252 --> 01:05:58.413
He doesn't need a Priest.
He needs a Doctor.

01:05:58.454 --> 01:06:01.321
A Priest can take
the Devil out of him.

01:06:01.357 --> 01:06:04.383
Train, get up. We gotta book.

01:06:08.898 --> 01:06:10.092
[Train] Excuse me.

01:06:10.132 --> 01:06:13.568
Hey, boy. Hey.

01:06:13.602 --> 01:06:17.663
Time for you
to take your medicine again.

01:06:18.474 --> 01:06:20.032
Here it comes. Ready?

01:06:20.076 --> 01:06:22.738
[humming]

01:06:23.779 --> 01:06:26.270
There. Thank you.

01:06:27.950 --> 01:06:30.009
Get you some of that soup, boy.

01:06:31.087 --> 01:06:32.179
Mmm.

01:06:36.826 --> 01:06:39.624
- Yes.
- He would not eat before.

01:06:42.765 --> 01:06:44.323
Here you go, boy.

01:06:46.202 --> 01:06:48.136
It's all over your shirt.

01:06:50.873 --> 01:06:54.434
- Come on, boy. Let's go.
- [in Italian] My Chocolate Giant.

01:06:54.477 --> 01:06:58.345
- OK, sarge. We ready.
- Oh, hold on, hold on, hold on.

01:06:58.381 --> 01:07:01.282
We? Boy, where the hell "we" goin'?

01:07:01.317 --> 01:07:03.410
You wasn't chiseling him,
we wouldn't be here.

01:07:03.452 --> 01:07:06.080
- You think Nokes is lookin' for us?
- What?

01:07:07.656 --> 01:07:10.420
Hector been tryin' to fix that radio
since we got here.

01:07:10.459 --> 01:07:12.222
- Shh!
- What?

01:07:16.065 --> 01:07:17.657
<i>Arrive- damn-derci.</i>

01:07:23.005 --> 01:07:28.375
Hector. We gotta bail. Ask the old man
if he'll show us another way outta here.

01:07:28.411 --> 01:07:31.812
- Maybe we can reach the 366.
- We can't get five feet outta here

01:07:31.847 --> 01:07:34.645
<i>without being flavor of the week
for the Guten Tags.</i>

01:07:34.683 --> 01:07:38.642
<i>These people survived for years
without mortars. Stay with the paisans.</i>

01:07:38.687 --> 01:07:41.986
You wanna stay here and play house,
go ahead, but I'm bookin'.

01:07:42.024 --> 01:07:45.619
Ask the old man if he'll show us
another way outta these mountains.

01:07:45.661 --> 01:07:50.291
Tell him we'll pay him. We got plenty of
that funny money they use around here.

01:07:50.332 --> 01:07:52.493
[speaks Italian]
Can you show us a safe path?

01:07:52.535 --> 01:07:54.400
There is no safe way.

01:07:54.437 --> 01:07:56.064
Germans. Boom! Boom!

01:07:56.264 --> 01:07:57.822
You know a way.

01:07:57.865 --> 01:08:01.062
Franco was the mailman,
ask him. I'm too old.

01:08:01.102 --> 01:08:04.469
Me? I have to deliver the mail.

01:08:04.505 --> 01:08:06.564
What mail, you old crazy fool?

01:08:06.608 --> 01:08:10.271
Old crazy fool? You're the old crazy,
like your mother and your father.

01:08:10.311 --> 01:08:12.541
- I know.
- You know?

01:08:12.580 --> 01:08:15.913
I know a way. I take you.

01:08:15.950 --> 01:08:17.417
[in Italian] What did you say?

01:08:19.687 --> 01:08:22.019
What did my daughter say?

01:08:22.055 --> 01:08:24.854
[in Italian] I have
nothing to do with this.

01:08:24.892 --> 01:08:27.587
Bishop. What you think?

01:08:27.629 --> 01:08:31.429
Little Red Riding Hood
lead us through the woods?

01:08:31.466 --> 01:08:33.934
I don't know, sarge.

01:08:33.968 --> 01:08:38.268
I mean, she fine. Man, she fine.

01:08:38.305 --> 01:08:42.332
I hear that they got
lady Mussolinis, too.

01:08:42.377 --> 01:08:44.345
Could be a trap.

01:08:46.948 --> 01:08:48.939
Hector.

01:08:48.983 --> 01:08:51.383
You the boss, staff sergeant.

01:08:51.419 --> 01:08:54.183
No good. No. No good.

01:08:55.622 --> 01:08:58.990
All of a sudden the old man
speaks some English, huh?

01:09:02.095 --> 01:09:03.586
[in Italian] Are you crazy in the head?

01:09:03.631 --> 01:09:05.029
Keep out of this.

01:09:05.899 --> 01:09:07.424
I forbid you to go.

01:09:07.468 --> 01:09:10.562
I don't need your permission.
Understand?

01:09:10.604 --> 01:09:12.800
You're still my daughter.

01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:16.799
Look, we'll find a way
outta here. Let's go.

01:09:28.756 --> 01:09:31.316
<i>Bye-bye, Americani.</i>

01:09:31.359 --> 01:09:33.327
Renata. Come away.

01:09:33.361 --> 01:09:34.555
No!

01:09:35.830 --> 01:09:38.060
Oh!

01:09:38.099 --> 01:09:42.001
Cigarette? Chocolate?

01:09:42.036 --> 01:09:43.765
[Stamps] Hell, no!

01:09:46.174 --> 01:09:47.698
[in Italian] Shove it up your ass.

01:09:49.810 --> 01:09:53.907
Sergeant Stamps out there
fussin' over what side to get back to.

01:09:53.948 --> 01:09:57.111
It don't mean nothin', boy.

01:09:57.151 --> 01:09:59.619
Me, I ain't got a side.

01:10:03.124 --> 01:10:06.821
[speaking Italian] Arturo said
that if you turn your head...

01:10:06.861 --> 01:10:08.453
it will be my birthday.

01:10:08.496 --> 01:10:12.557
I'll get toys and lots of candy.

01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:14.932
Now, please turn your head.

01:10:15.903 --> 01:10:17.894
Please turn your head.

01:10:19.507 --> 01:10:23.238
I can't understand your words, boy.

01:10:23.277 --> 01:10:25.177
But I don't need to.

01:10:25.213 --> 01:10:30.150
You see, everything you touch,
you brings good to it. You do.

01:10:31.552 --> 01:10:35.079
See this little thing here?
lt'll make you invisible.

01:10:35.123 --> 01:10:40.823
Give you the strength of five people.
You ain't got to own nothin'.

01:10:40.862 --> 01:10:43.490
Ain't got to be a big somebody.

01:10:43.531 --> 01:10:47.126
All you got to do is believe in it, boy.

01:10:50.338 --> 01:10:52.329
Go on, boy. Go on.

01:10:57.345 --> 01:11:00.109
[in Italian] Can you turn
your head like this? See?

01:11:00.148 --> 01:11:03.845
God made this thing here
through man's hand.

01:11:03.885 --> 01:11:09.346
But the Lord gived it
shape and purpose.

01:11:09.390 --> 01:11:11.858
And through this little thing here,

01:11:11.893 --> 01:11:14.794
God gives you somethin' else, boy.

01:11:14.829 --> 01:11:18.595
You know what it is?
I'ma tell ya, I'ma tell ya.

01:11:18.633 --> 01:11:20.362
It's a secret.

01:11:21.469 --> 01:11:22.868
Miracles.

01:11:25.773 --> 01:11:27.604
[in Italian] Listen, Chocolate Giant.

01:11:27.642 --> 01:11:29.576
You've got to do what I say.

01:11:29.610 --> 01:11:32.408
Turn your head
so it will be my birthday.

01:11:32.447 --> 01:11:34.642
You want me
to stay eight forever?

01:11:36.184 --> 01:11:37.583
Turn your head.

01:11:38.786 --> 01:11:40.447
Arturo!

01:11:41.122 --> 01:11:43.454
Yes! I did it!

01:11:43.491 --> 01:11:44.981
I'm nine years old!

01:11:45.026 --> 01:11:47.790
Hey! Yes!

01:11:47.829 --> 01:11:49.524
Nine years old!

01:11:49.964 --> 01:11:51.556
Hurray!

01:11:51.599 --> 01:11:53.066
Nine years old!

01:11:53.100 --> 01:11:54.431
Boy, you got the spirit?

01:11:54.469 --> 01:11:57.063
[Arturo, in Italian]
I did it! Nine years old!

01:11:57.104 --> 01:12:00.562
You know up high, down low?
Gimme five.

01:12:00.608 --> 01:12:03.441
Gimme five. All right. All right.

01:12:03.478 --> 01:12:05.639
Up high.

01:12:07.381 --> 01:12:11.078
Up high, gimme five. OK.

01:12:11.118 --> 01:12:13.951
Gimme five. Gimme five.

01:12:13.988 --> 01:12:17.287
Up high. Down low.

01:12:17.325 --> 01:12:19.520
Down low. Too slow.

01:12:23.097 --> 01:12:25.361
You know that one? Gimme five.

01:12:25.399 --> 01:12:27.094
Up high.

01:12:27.134 --> 01:12:28.658
Down low.

01:12:28.703 --> 01:12:30.193
Too slow.

01:12:31.472 --> 01:12:33.736
Let's see if I got some chocolate here.

01:12:35.743 --> 01:12:37.438
You like chocolate?

01:12:37.478 --> 01:12:39.708
[giggles]

01:12:39.747 --> 01:12:42.238
Yeah.

01:12:42.283 --> 01:12:43.750
How'd I get up here?

01:12:43.784 --> 01:12:47.242
The only place where
the Germans would not be

01:12:47.288 --> 01:12:50.587
is through the mountain
in Pietrasanta, Lucca.

01:12:50.625 --> 01:12:53.594
It's here. See?

01:12:53.628 --> 01:12:58.031
And that's where I think you
gonna find your people.

01:12:58.065 --> 01:13:01.330
- Here you go, Hector.
- Thanks, Train.

01:13:09.277 --> 01:13:10.676
Boy!

01:13:14.982 --> 01:13:17.109
[speaking Italian]
How do you know?

01:13:17.151 --> 01:13:18.345
Is that true?

01:13:19.420 --> 01:13:21.445
Yeah, I know.

01:13:21.489 --> 01:13:22.820
[in Italian]
Who are you talking to?

01:13:22.857 --> 01:13:24.984
- To Arturo.
- Arturo?

01:13:25.026 --> 01:13:26.050
Who's Arturo?

01:13:26.093 --> 01:13:27.424
My friend.

01:13:29.430 --> 01:13:30.829
And where is he?

01:13:32.099 --> 01:13:34.124
Over there, do you see?

01:13:34.168 --> 01:13:36.227
He's shy in front of other people.

01:13:46.547 --> 01:13:47.741
Hey.

01:14:16.210 --> 01:14:17.871
Arturo, what do you think?

01:14:18.479 --> 01:14:19.707
Shall we help him?

01:14:21.248 --> 01:14:23.011
<i>[man on radio]
Three-seventy to Stamps.</i>

01:14:23.050 --> 01:14:24.677
[in Italian] We did it.

01:14:24.719 --> 01:14:27.210
<i>Three-seventy to Stamps.</i>

01:14:27.254 --> 01:14:30.223
Three-seventy to Stamps. Over.

01:14:34.195 --> 01:14:38.154
Three-seventy, this is Negron,
George Company, over.

01:14:38.199 --> 01:14:40.565
Got him, sir. I got the lost squad.

01:14:40.601 --> 01:14:42.296
Get up.

01:14:42.336 --> 01:14:47.000
- Stamps, you need to get in here!
- Hallelujah.

01:14:47.041 --> 01:14:49.441
I think the kid fixed the radio, man.

01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:55.776
- Who am I speaking with?
- Staff Sergeant Stamps.

01:14:55.816 --> 01:14:58.944
Staff Sergeant Stamps.
Send position, over.

01:14:58.986 --> 01:15:02.478
West of Borgo a Mozzano. We can see
the Mountain of the Sleeping Man.

01:15:02.523 --> 01:15:05.720
The Mount... The what?
Where's that in relation to here?

01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:08.228
West of the Serchio River someplace.
Over.

01:15:08.262 --> 01:15:11.231
Don't know how you got there,
we gonna make the most of it.

01:15:11.265 --> 01:15:14.063
- Seen any German sons of bitches?
- Have I seen any Krauts?

01:15:14.101 --> 01:15:16.729
No, motherfucker, just Cab
Calloway and his orchestra.

01:15:16.771 --> 01:15:18.170
Shh!

01:15:19.473 --> 01:15:21.907
Negative. But we think we're surrounded.

01:15:21.942 --> 01:15:25.309
Good. We want you to capture
a Nazi bastard. That's important.

01:15:25.346 --> 01:15:27.974
<i>[Nokes] We need to extract ASAP. Over.</i>

01:15:28.015 --> 01:15:32.452
Just get the Jerry and hold tight. That
is a direct order from General Almond.

01:15:32.486 --> 01:15:35.717
<i>- [Stamps] Hold tight with what? Over!
- I just gave you an order.</i>

01:15:35.756 --> 01:15:37.314
Now, you get that Jerry.

01:15:37.358 --> 01:15:41.954
<i>I will radio you
tomorrow at 0400.</i>

01:15:41.996 --> 01:15:45.830
And don't get yourself
shot up. Out.

01:15:47.968 --> 01:15:51.404
Fine. Bishop, follow me.

01:15:51.439 --> 01:15:52.736
Oh, man.

01:15:57.712 --> 01:15:59.407
This is a joke.

01:15:59.447 --> 01:16:02.439
First, your ace-boon-coon
giant goes off the deep end,

01:16:02.483 --> 01:16:05.782
now this God-and-country redneck
wants me to fetch a prisoner.

01:16:05.820 --> 01:16:09.187
- Something's cookin' around here.
- Thought you liked Nokes.

01:16:09.223 --> 01:16:12.124
- Who said I liked him?
- I seen you shinin' up to him.

01:16:12.159 --> 01:16:15.151
I ain't runnin' around
with sleeves cuffing poker cards

01:16:15.196 --> 01:16:18.256
don't mean I like Nokes.
Besides, he ain't the worst.

01:16:18.299 --> 01:16:20.961
The man left us high
and dry at the Serchio.

01:16:21.001 --> 01:16:24.801
Hear you tell it, you told the man
three times to fire that 105,

01:16:24.839 --> 01:16:27.205
- and he didn't.
- He ain't the first white man

01:16:27.241 --> 01:16:31.234
don't trust colored folks' word.
The knife cuts both ways, Bishop.

01:16:31.278 --> 01:16:33.803
Nokes reports to Driscoll.
Driscoll's fair.

01:16:33.848 --> 01:16:38.148
Shit, nigga, is you crazy? The only
reason white folks is thinkin' now

01:16:38.185 --> 01:16:41.518
about bein' fair in this Army
is Krauts is cuttin' their toenails

01:16:41.555 --> 01:16:44.080
too short and they runnin'
outta whites to die.

01:16:44.125 --> 01:16:46.423
Don't matter.
They said we couldn't fight.

01:16:46.460 --> 01:16:49.793
Had us float balloons, work as
quartermasters, cook and clean.

01:16:49.830 --> 01:16:52.765
The 92nd proved we can fight.
This is our country, too.

01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:56.201
We helped build it from the ground up.
I'm here for my children

01:16:56.237 --> 01:16:59.536
and future grandchildren,
Bishop! This is about progress!

01:16:59.573 --> 01:17:03.407
Nigga, please. Prog...

01:17:03.444 --> 01:17:05.435
You know what?

01:17:06.680 --> 01:17:10.411
Staff Sergeant,
you remember this progress?

01:17:12.753 --> 01:17:14.880
Mm-hm.

01:17:25.966 --> 01:17:28.730
- Tellin' you. Lena Horne.
- And Satchel Paige?

01:17:28.769 --> 01:17:31.135
Satchel Paige owe me $20.

01:17:31.172 --> 01:17:34.437
- You know 'em both?
- In and out.

01:17:34.475 --> 01:17:37.444
We only got an hour before
we gotta be back for maneuvers.

01:17:37.478 --> 01:17:41.312
Colonel Driscoll coming to
watch, too. Bishop, you hear me?

01:17:41.348 --> 01:17:42.940
I ain't studyin' Driscoll.

01:17:42.983 --> 01:17:44.974
[indistinct chatter]

01:17:48.856 --> 01:17:50.414
Contest winner right there.

01:17:52.693 --> 01:17:54.923
- Afternoon, fellas.
- Howdy.

01:17:56.463 --> 01:17:58.693
See we got some
Krauts up in here.

01:17:58.732 --> 01:18:00.097
[in German] Soon we'll be
going back home.

01:18:00.134 --> 01:18:01.658
Nobody believes that.

01:18:01.702 --> 01:18:05.297
He just wants to visit
his girlfriend.

01:18:05.339 --> 01:18:07.830
- Yep.
- What do you boys want?

01:18:07.875 --> 01:18:10.469
No problem. We looking
for some good old ice slops.

01:18:10.511 --> 01:18:12.274
Go around back.
I'll get you some.

01:18:13.781 --> 01:18:14.805
Train.

01:18:17.751 --> 01:18:20.345
They went 'round back, too?

01:18:21.422 --> 01:18:23.788
Nigra, who I serve
is my damn business.

01:18:23.824 --> 01:18:25.985
Hitler's goose-steppers
you feeding.

01:18:26.026 --> 01:18:29.052
Want me to eat out a trough
in the backyard like I'm some pig?

01:18:29.096 --> 01:18:31.621
You want me to
shoot you in the head?

01:18:32.366 --> 01:18:33.526
Calm down!

01:18:33.567 --> 01:18:35.865
Put the goddamn gun down, Herb!

01:18:35.903 --> 01:18:39.202
- We're all Americans here.
- Whose side you on? Theirs or ours?

01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:42.835
- Respect the uniform.
- I'll tell you what, all right?

01:18:42.877 --> 01:18:45.903
- I'll pay for the damn ice slops.
- Whose side are you on?

01:18:45.946 --> 01:18:48.915
- You want this whole shop off-limits?
- Wish you'd try.

01:18:48.949 --> 01:18:51.179
We got the ice cream, guys.

01:18:51.218 --> 01:18:56.121
Suggest you boys find your way
back to base. You understand me?

01:18:56.156 --> 01:18:58.886
Get these Jerrys out quick.
Move, goddamn it, move!

01:18:58.926 --> 01:19:01.952
<i>Get on your goddamn feet!
Schnell, goddamn it, schnell!</i>

01:19:01.996 --> 01:19:05.864
- I don't have all goddamn day!
- I don't have time for this shit.

01:19:10.170 --> 01:19:12.661
Goddamn it!
Pick up your goddamn feet!

01:19:12.706 --> 01:19:15.675
<i>Didn't your Fuhrer teach
you how to march, boys? Move it!</i>

01:19:17.745 --> 01:19:22.148
What y'all niggers waiting on?
Y'all deaf nigras? Go on.

01:19:22.182 --> 01:19:26.812
It's time for you to go.
Wanna get strung up? Go on!

01:19:26.854 --> 01:19:30.790
It's whites only in here. You tell
your friends they're not welcome here.

01:19:30.824 --> 01:19:34.351
You spread the news.
You big baboon! Go on, git!

01:19:34.395 --> 01:19:36.260
Git!

01:19:37.932 --> 01:19:42.266
- Stamps, what happened?
- [Herb] Lucky this time.

01:19:42.303 --> 01:19:45.033
Bishop? Where the ice slops?

01:19:50.377 --> 01:19:54.336
There's a lesson for you, son.
That's how you treat these animals.

01:19:54.381 --> 01:19:56.281
Mm-hm.

01:20:30.517 --> 01:20:31.984
[guns cocking]

01:20:51.972 --> 01:20:56.909
Between the nigra in uniform and free
yellow-bellied Japs running around,

01:20:56.944 --> 01:20:59.936
country's gone to
hell in a handbasket.

01:21:09.490 --> 01:21:11.958
- Put 'em down.
- Oh, shit.

01:21:11.992 --> 01:21:16.088
Good afternoon. Look, you
cock-a-doodle-doo Bumfuck, Louisiana

01:21:16.130 --> 01:21:19.793
motherfucker, I want my five
ice slops with a cherry on top.

01:21:19.833 --> 01:21:22.267
Right there where you
served them Jerrys at.

01:21:22.302 --> 01:21:24.395
- Sure.
- Wash your hands 'fore you serve

01:21:24.438 --> 01:21:28.499
since you was likely yanking
those Krauts' cocks all morning.

01:21:28.542 --> 01:21:31.875
Please, I got my wife and my son
here. Please, just take it easy.

01:21:31.912 --> 01:21:33.937
We'll do whatever you like.

01:21:33.981 --> 01:21:37.382
- [woman] It's OK.
- Stamps.

01:21:37.418 --> 01:21:39.648
I changed my mind.
Make it to go.

01:21:39.686 --> 01:21:43.053
I wouldn't get caught dead
eatin' in a shithole like this.

01:21:43.090 --> 01:21:45.524
Vera? We got some paper cups
for these gentlemen?

01:21:45.559 --> 01:21:47.527
- Come on, cracker.
- [Vera] Just a second.

01:21:47.561 --> 01:21:49.358
- Hurry up.
- [Herb] How many are ya?

01:21:49.396 --> 01:21:51.694
- [Stamps] Five.
- [Herb] Five on the house.

01:21:51.732 --> 01:21:53.199
[Bishop] Come on, boy, git!

01:21:53.233 --> 01:21:55.758
- [Herb] Cherries as well?
- [Bishop] I said cherries!

01:21:55.803 --> 01:21:58.033
- [Herb] Cherries it is.
- [Bishop] Hurry up.

01:21:58.072 --> 01:22:00.632
[Herb] Get the top
off of that for me.

01:22:00.674 --> 01:22:04.110
- [Bishop] Now, come on, boy.
- [Herb] As fast as I can here.

01:22:37.945 --> 01:22:41.506
[Train] OK, boy. We got to
figure out a way to talk.

01:22:41.548 --> 01:22:46.508
I got a cousin back home, can't
talk. So what he do is tap.

01:22:46.553 --> 01:22:50.990
So what we'll do is tap. OK?

01:22:51.024 --> 01:22:53.891
OK. Now, follow me.

01:22:53.927 --> 01:22:57.727
One tap means "yes."

01:22:57.764 --> 01:23:01.029
Two taps means "no."

01:23:01.068 --> 01:23:06.904
Three taps means...
[groans] "try."

01:23:07.774 --> 01:23:10.607
Four taps means...

01:23:13.413 --> 01:23:18.009
...you sleepy.
Five taps means...

01:23:19.286 --> 01:23:21.413
...you got to
take your medicine.

01:23:23.257 --> 01:23:27.387
Six tap, this one
is real important, boy...

01:23:30.464 --> 01:23:33.729
Boom! Boom!
[makes explosion sounds]

01:23:33.767 --> 01:23:36.429
It's danger. It's bad.
It's trouble.

01:23:36.470 --> 01:23:39.667
- OK. One.
- Si.

01:23:39.706 --> 01:23:43.107
- Two tap?
- No.

01:23:43.143 --> 01:23:45.839
- Three tap?
- [speaks Italian]

01:23:47.281 --> 01:23:50.842
I don't quite understand, boy,
but I think you got it.

01:23:50.884 --> 01:23:54.411
- Four tap.
- [mimics snoring]

01:23:54.454 --> 01:23:58.185
Ooh! Five tap.

01:24:00.394 --> 01:24:03.989
OK, boy, it's only one more
left. You ready?

01:24:04.031 --> 01:24:05.521
Six tap.

01:24:05.566 --> 01:24:07.534
[makes gun noises]

01:24:07.568 --> 01:24:08.967
Boom! Boom!

01:24:50.244 --> 01:24:53.543
- [music playing]
- [people laughing]

01:25:33.320 --> 01:25:34.981
[in Italian] Good. Good.

01:25:35.022 --> 01:25:38.219
<i>- You want to learn italiano?
- I'm trying.</i>

01:25:40.861 --> 01:25:43.523
[chattering in Italian]

01:25:49.169 --> 01:25:53.902
- Renata, are you married?
- Yes.

01:25:53.940 --> 01:25:57.876
His name is Vittorio.
Soldier like you.

01:26:01.848 --> 01:26:07.548
You, Negroes, you're different
from other Americans.

01:26:07.587 --> 01:26:10.988
Ain't no difference
in us, really.

01:26:11.024 --> 01:26:14.653
No, we're just different
where it counts. That's all.

01:26:14.695 --> 01:26:18.096
- What do you mean?
- Renata, baby,

01:26:18.131 --> 01:26:21.760
let me put it to you this way.
If you ever, ever been colored

01:26:21.802 --> 01:26:26.796
on a Harlem Saturday night, girl,
you wouldn't wanna be nothing else.

01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:28.432
What does that mean?

01:26:29.443 --> 01:26:30.842
Mm-hm.

01:26:30.877 --> 01:26:34.438
- You should let me show you.
- Why you spreading foolishness?

01:26:51.131 --> 01:26:54.294
- Where are you going?
- [Stamps] It smells in here.

01:27:03.310 --> 01:27:05.005
You smoke, baby?

01:27:05.045 --> 01:27:07.445
How about just one?

01:27:08.749 --> 01:27:10.216
They're Camels.

01:27:11.118 --> 01:27:13.484
<i>Americano cigarettos.</i>

01:27:14.921 --> 01:27:16.115
Filterless.

01:27:17.724 --> 01:27:19.487
Smooth taste.

01:27:20.894 --> 01:27:22.361
Great value.

01:27:24.765 --> 01:27:25.993
Go on, girl.

01:27:27.100 --> 01:27:29.091
Should not smoke in church.

01:27:31.571 --> 01:27:33.368
Mm-hm.

01:27:43.083 --> 01:27:45.176
Hey, sarge.

01:27:45.218 --> 01:27:48.745
- Any word from the radio?
- Yep. Snafu.

01:27:48.789 --> 01:27:51.189
"Situation normal,
all fucked up."

01:27:54.561 --> 01:27:58.190
Negroes like Bishop
set the race back 400 years.

01:27:58.231 --> 01:28:02.964
He'd stick his limp,
light-skinned penis in a 88 if he could.

01:28:03.003 --> 01:28:05.198
- He calls me a handkerchief head.
- What?

01:28:05.238 --> 01:28:07.729
- An Uncle Tom.
- Hey, I don't...

01:28:07.774 --> 01:28:10.675
I know. Puerto Ricans ain't
got nothing to do with it.

01:28:10.710 --> 01:28:13.975
No, sir. I mean,
look, Bishop is Bishop.

01:28:14.014 --> 01:28:17.074
For what it's worth,
you're doing a hell of a job out here.

01:28:17.117 --> 01:28:20.052
- Something wrong here.
- Wrong with what?

01:28:20.086 --> 01:28:22.816
Getting to love Italy.
I ain't a nigger here.

01:28:22.856 --> 01:28:26.019
- I'm just me.
- Yeah. Same here.

01:28:26.059 --> 01:28:28.118
These Italians is
catchin' holy hell,

01:28:28.161 --> 01:28:30.527
but ain't studying
how to keep a Negro down.

01:28:30.564 --> 01:28:34.694
I ain't never felt so free in my life.
Makes me feel ashamed to feel more free

01:28:34.734 --> 01:28:36.895
in a foreign country
than I do in my own.

01:28:38.605 --> 01:28:41.972
All my tomorrows was based on America
gettin' better. If it doesn't?

01:28:42.008 --> 01:28:45.034
Just enjoy the night, my friend.

01:28:45.078 --> 01:28:47.046
'Cause tomorrow may never come.

01:28:47.080 --> 01:28:48.775
[in Italian] Hector. Come?

01:28:49.483 --> 01:28:50.507
Sarge?

01:28:53.286 --> 01:28:55.083
[exhales]

01:28:55.121 --> 01:28:56.383
[in Italian] Thank you.

01:28:58.058 --> 01:28:59.582
- Wine?
- Certainly.

01:29:13.240 --> 01:29:15.572
[bell tolling]

01:29:49.643 --> 01:29:51.508
What?

01:29:51.545 --> 01:29:54.343
You have never seen
a woman's breasts before?

01:30:01.588 --> 01:30:03.556
Renata, you're beautiful.

01:30:04.724 --> 01:30:06.191
Thank you.

01:30:19.873 --> 01:30:20.931
Who are you?

01:30:20.974 --> 01:30:22.202
[in Italian] Who are you?

01:30:22.242 --> 01:30:23.266
Who the fuck are you?

01:30:23.310 --> 01:30:24.334
Partisans?

01:30:24.377 --> 01:30:25.435
Who are you?

01:30:25.478 --> 01:30:26.604
Partisans?

01:30:31.017 --> 01:30:32.712
Come here! Come here!

01:30:40.226 --> 01:30:41.693
Bastard!

01:30:41.728 --> 01:30:42.956
Go! Go!

01:30:46.032 --> 01:30:47.829
Fucking swine! Go!

01:31:03.283 --> 01:31:05.114
- [in Italian] It's him, isn't it?
- Yes!

01:31:05.151 --> 01:31:06.641
I knew he'd come back.

01:31:09.422 --> 01:31:10.582
Everything's okay.

01:31:10.624 --> 01:31:11.750
Tell them to put down
their arms.

01:31:11.791 --> 01:31:15.090
- What do they want?
- Food.

01:31:15.128 --> 01:31:16.959
- [in Italian] Americans?
- Yes.

01:31:16.997 --> 01:31:20.524
- You know these boys?
- Yes.

01:31:26.940 --> 01:31:28.032
Here's some bread.

01:31:33.480 --> 01:31:34.970
Thank you.

01:31:37.384 --> 01:31:38.681
[man] Peppi.

01:31:38.718 --> 01:31:39.980
Gianni.

01:31:42.122 --> 01:31:43.749
Italo.

01:31:43.790 --> 01:31:46.020
Hector,
where is their papers?

01:31:46.059 --> 01:31:47.993
[Hector, in Italian]
Your documents.

01:31:51.698 --> 01:31:52.790
Read this.

01:31:52.832 --> 01:31:54.527
We got a wise guy.

01:32:00.740 --> 01:32:02.935
And I was running,
and I jumped...

01:32:02.976 --> 01:32:05.103
Where were you, Train?

01:32:05.145 --> 01:32:07.477
I took the boy out
for some fresh air.

01:32:07.514 --> 01:32:11.075
We got a situation here,
soldier. Grab your rifle.

01:32:13.019 --> 01:32:16.318
- Train, get your rifle now.
- What you want, boy?

01:32:19.959 --> 01:32:21.756
Private, get your rifle!

01:32:21.795 --> 01:32:25.162
We need to skedaddle outta here.
Hector, get on that radio.

01:32:25.198 --> 01:32:28.099
Negative. We sit tight,
wait for Nokes to radio again.

01:32:28.134 --> 01:32:30.602
- What is wrong with you?
- What he said to do.

01:32:30.637 --> 01:32:33.731
No, he said get a Kraut prisoner.
We motherfuckin' got one.

01:32:33.773 --> 01:32:36.708
He's sitting here eating
like a fucking butcher's dog.

01:32:36.743 --> 01:32:39.268
- We gotta wait. His orders.
- You know, Stamps,

01:32:39.312 --> 01:32:42.543
<i>we can't sit with these wops
till one of these signoras decides</i>

01:32:42.582 --> 01:32:46.814
to give you some pussy.
Now, you had your chance last night.

01:32:46.853 --> 01:32:49.048
I got a mind to take this out
and part your head with it.

01:32:49.089 --> 01:32:51.751
Uh-uh. No.

01:32:55.061 --> 01:32:56.323
Please.

01:33:01.167 --> 01:33:02.464
[in Italian]
What are they saying?

01:33:02.502 --> 01:33:05.198
Those two have been fighting
since they got here.

01:33:05.238 --> 01:33:09.538
- They want the German.
- We're holding the German, he's ours.

01:33:09.576 --> 01:33:12.443
We'll interrogate him once
we find someone who speaks German.

01:33:12.479 --> 01:33:15.277
He's their prisoner.
They're gonna interrogate,

01:33:15.315 --> 01:33:18.580
- looking for somebody speaks German.
- We got plenty of people

01:33:18.618 --> 01:33:21.314
back at headquarters. Come.
We'll get the job done.

01:33:21.354 --> 01:33:24.619
[in Italian] At headquarters a lot
of people speak German. Let's go.

01:33:24.657 --> 01:33:27.125
First, we ask him questions.

01:33:27.160 --> 01:33:28.855
Then we'll turn him over.

01:33:28.895 --> 01:33:32.490
They want answers, and until
they get 'em, he ain't going nowhere.

01:33:32.532 --> 01:33:37.697
All right. I understand.

01:33:37.737 --> 01:33:38.795
The hell with that!

01:33:42.475 --> 01:33:43.999
Oh, shit!

01:33:49.449 --> 01:33:52.577
Boy! Boy!

01:33:59.959 --> 01:34:01.824
[speaking German] You're alive.

01:34:01.861 --> 01:34:04.625
I told you to run and you made it.

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.230
Such a good Boy.

01:34:09.936 --> 01:34:11.665
Such a good, clever Boy.

01:34:13.506 --> 01:34:15.565
Just like my little brother, Ulrich.

01:34:16.743 --> 01:34:19.177
You even have the same hair.

01:34:20.680 --> 01:34:23.012
You have to listen little brother.

01:34:23.883 --> 01:34:25.077
Listen closely.

01:34:26.586 --> 01:34:28.577
You've got to run again.

01:34:29.622 --> 01:34:31.180
Get away.

01:34:31.224 --> 01:34:34.489
[speaking Italian] Talking too much.
I told you we should have killed him.

01:34:36.162 --> 01:34:37.754
[in Italian] Do you understand? Run.

01:34:37.797 --> 01:34:38.957
Run again.

01:34:38.998 --> 01:34:40.260
Run as fast as you can.

01:34:40.300 --> 01:34:41.528
Shut up!

01:34:43.036 --> 01:34:45.732
Get on the radio!
We got a German prisoner!

01:34:45.772 --> 01:34:48.832
Three seventy, this is George
Company. We have a German.

01:34:48.875 --> 01:34:50.900
I repeat, we have a German. Over.

01:34:50.944 --> 01:34:54.243
<i>[man on radio] George Company,
stay put. We'll get back to you. Out.</i>

01:34:54.280 --> 01:34:55.645
Roger. Out.

01:34:57.750 --> 01:34:59.615
[in Italian] So, how did you get lights?

01:35:02.388 --> 01:35:03.650
I don't know.

01:35:05.024 --> 01:35:06.548
It was a Miracle.

01:35:06.593 --> 01:35:09.687
Do you know what
the real Miracle is?

01:35:09.729 --> 01:35:11.287
Is that you're still alive.

01:35:31.985 --> 01:35:33.009
[spits]

01:35:40.260 --> 01:35:42.626
[door opens, closes]

01:35:43.529 --> 01:35:45.793
[Hector] Train, Nokes is coming.

01:35:45.832 --> 01:35:48.232
He's comin' himself.

01:35:48.268 --> 01:35:52.329
[Train] Something goin' on, Hec.
Something bad.

01:35:53.239 --> 01:35:57.107
Nobody think the boy see nothin'.

01:35:57.143 --> 01:35:59.270
But he sees it all.

01:36:02.015 --> 01:36:03.915
I know, big guy.

01:36:03.950 --> 01:36:06.475
That I know.

01:36:06.519 --> 01:36:09.818
You think I gotta give him back
when the captain comes?

01:36:11.557 --> 01:36:16.221
I know how close you are to him,
Train, but that's not my call.

01:36:16.262 --> 01:36:18.093
I need to talk to him now.

01:36:21.134 --> 01:36:23.534
- Go on.
- Thank you.

01:36:26.139 --> 01:36:27.936
[speaking Italian] So,

01:36:27.974 --> 01:36:29.942
how are you feeling?

01:36:29.976 --> 01:36:31.000
Want a chocolate?

01:36:32.178 --> 01:36:33.202
It's good.

01:36:37.283 --> 01:36:38.910
I need your help.

01:36:44.290 --> 01:36:47.020
- Train?
- Hey, boy.

01:36:53.833 --> 01:36:55.323
[in Italian] What's your name?

01:36:56.302 --> 01:36:58.793
Angelo. Angelo Torancelli.

01:36:59.772 --> 01:37:01.967
[in Italian] Me, I'm Hector.

01:37:02.742 --> 01:37:04.141
Where are you from?

01:37:04.177 --> 01:37:06.236
From St. Anna di Stazzema.

01:37:07.547 --> 01:37:09.014
Angelo...

01:37:09.048 --> 01:37:10.709
that German...

01:37:10.750 --> 01:37:11.774
do you know him?

01:37:12.986 --> 01:37:16.251
Yes. There were a lot of them.

01:37:17.390 --> 01:37:19.654
What did he tell you just now?

01:37:19.692 --> 01:37:22.388
He told me what he told me before.

01:37:22.428 --> 01:37:24.896
He told me to run as fast as I can.

01:37:24.931 --> 01:37:25.989
When?

01:37:26.032 --> 01:37:29.524
Before. At the fire. At the Church.

01:37:31.270 --> 01:37:33.431
What fire?

01:37:36.009 --> 01:37:37.704
Angelo.

01:37:37.744 --> 01:37:39.644
Your father and your mother...

01:37:39.679 --> 01:37:41.647
Where is your father and your mother?

01:37:42.849 --> 01:37:44.874
[crying]

01:37:47.653 --> 01:37:51.282
- Oh, Hec, leave him be.
- Train, please.

01:37:51.324 --> 01:37:53.155
Just one more thing.

01:37:57.964 --> 01:37:59.898
[in Italian] Why are you
so afraid of him?

01:37:59.932 --> 01:38:01.923
I'm not afraid of him.

01:38:01.968 --> 01:38:03.492
He's my friend.

01:38:03.536 --> 01:38:05.231
I'm afraid of the other one.

01:38:05.271 --> 01:38:06.329
What other one?

01:38:12.145 --> 01:38:13.976
[sobbing]

01:38:24.223 --> 01:38:26.987
[angry crowd noise building]

01:38:35.268 --> 01:38:36.633
[in Italian] Murderer!

01:38:36.669 --> 01:38:37.863
- Nazi! Dirty pig!
- Burn in hell!

01:38:37.904 --> 01:38:39.428
Send that son of a whore out here!

01:38:39.472 --> 01:38:41.030
Get back!

01:38:41.074 --> 01:38:42.439
We'll rip his eyes out!

01:38:42.475 --> 01:38:43.942
Butterfly!

01:38:48.181 --> 01:38:49.375
Who threw that?

01:38:52.185 --> 01:38:53.311
Give him to us!

01:38:53.352 --> 01:38:54.376
We want him now!

01:38:56.689 --> 01:38:57.713
[all screaming]

01:39:02.662 --> 01:39:03.822
Go, go, go!

01:39:05.131 --> 01:39:07.463
You have two days. No more. Tell them!

01:39:07.500 --> 01:39:09.297
He says you have two days. No more.

01:39:09.335 --> 01:39:10.734
[in Italian] He'll stay here.

01:39:10.770 --> 01:39:13.261
He will leave his man.

01:39:16.943 --> 01:39:19.377
- Where's he goin'?
- I don't know.

01:39:19.412 --> 01:39:21.642
[in Italian] I need
another pair of eyes.

01:39:21.681 --> 01:39:25.082
- When is Nokes comin'?
- Soon. He's comin' himself.

01:39:25.118 --> 01:39:26.983
- It's time that we all go.
- Where?

01:39:28.254 --> 01:39:30.722
[in Italian] Excuse me.
Can we have a moment?

01:39:33.359 --> 01:39:35.190
Train's kid. All right?

01:39:35.228 --> 01:39:38.720
He's talkin' that he's seen a church,
a fire, the Italian guy.

01:39:38.764 --> 01:39:40.857
Which church, fire? Which Italian guy?

01:39:40.900 --> 01:39:43.994
I don't know. He's seen something bad,
he's definitely seen him.

01:39:44.036 --> 01:39:45.731
I seen him, too. So what?

01:39:45.771 --> 01:39:47.636
The kid hasn't talked in days.

01:39:47.673 --> 01:39:49.971
All of a sudden he sees
him and he's talkin'?

01:39:50.009 --> 01:39:52.477
- It ain't right.
- That's just skippy,

01:39:52.512 --> 01:39:55.276
but I ain't got time
to talk to him right now.

01:39:55.314 --> 01:39:57.248
You, come here.

01:39:57.283 --> 01:40:00.275
Gather who will come,
we'll take 'em down the mountain.

01:40:00.319 --> 01:40:02.116
- We do not come with you.
- Why not?

01:40:02.155 --> 01:40:04.385
- Nazis in all villages.
- Yeah. Boom, boom.

01:40:04.423 --> 01:40:06.914
Sit tight and it'll
be jingle bells real soon.

01:40:06.959 --> 01:40:09.052
The U.S. Army's sittin' in front of you.

01:40:09.095 --> 01:40:12.326
We need Army inside house now!
Three years we've been waiting.

01:40:12.365 --> 01:40:16.028
First the British, then the Americans.
Italy is tired to wait.

01:40:17.036 --> 01:40:20.164
Let's talk to your partisan.

01:40:20.206 --> 01:40:23.266
Ask your friend to climb the
ridge and tell us what he sees.

01:40:23.309 --> 01:40:26.244
[in Italian] He wants you
to go up the Mountain...

01:40:26.279 --> 01:40:27.541
and tell us what you see.

01:40:27.580 --> 01:40:29.013
Come on.

01:40:43.396 --> 01:40:46.593
- I don't trust that guy.
- He's a good man.

01:40:46.632 --> 01:40:49.396
He's a partisan. He's from this valley.

01:40:49.435 --> 01:40:52.302
- She grew up with him.
- Yeah. OK. Great.

01:40:52.338 --> 01:40:56.707
I don't care if he's Frank Sinatra
or Joltin' Joe DiMaggio himself.

01:40:56.742 --> 01:40:59.802
Somethin' about his eyes
I just don't trust.

01:41:14.193 --> 01:41:16.491
Mm-hm.

01:42:04.744 --> 01:42:07.269
G.I. G.I. G.I.

01:42:08.714 --> 01:42:11.274
Hey! Alessio!

01:42:11.317 --> 01:42:15.014
You ring that motherfuckin' bell
you see Hitler!

01:42:15.054 --> 01:42:17.215
I got more of this
Hershey's for ya!

01:42:17.256 --> 01:42:18.553
[laughs]

01:42:18.591 --> 01:42:21.583
G.I. G.I. G.I.

01:42:35.141 --> 01:42:36.165
[in Italian] Well?

01:42:37.343 --> 01:42:38.401
Is it safe?

01:42:39.545 --> 01:42:41.479
Yes, it's safe. Yes.

01:42:41.514 --> 01:42:42.572
Good.

01:42:42.615 --> 01:42:44.947
- Is it good?
- It's safe.

01:42:44.984 --> 01:42:46.451
Here, take your Kraut.

01:42:46.485 --> 01:42:47.918
[in Italian] Come with me.

01:42:47.953 --> 01:42:49.511
Go.

01:42:49.555 --> 01:42:52.149
- Hector, watch both of them.
- Gladly.

01:42:52.825 --> 01:42:54.190
After you.

01:42:57.663 --> 01:42:59.358
[Hector speaking Spanish] What's that?

01:42:59.398 --> 01:43:01.389
[speaking Italian]
I don't understand Spanish.

01:43:01.434 --> 01:43:02.958
[in Italian] What is that?

01:43:03.002 --> 01:43:04.060
A cigarette.

01:43:04.103 --> 01:43:06.503
No, that's not a cigarette.

01:43:07.707 --> 01:43:09.106
American cigarettes.

01:43:10.876 --> 01:43:12.503
Good.

01:43:12.545 --> 01:43:13.773
Very good.

01:43:17.616 --> 01:43:18.878
What's your name?

01:43:19.785 --> 01:43:20.945
Rodolfo.

01:43:20.986 --> 01:43:22.613
Hector.

01:43:22.655 --> 01:43:26.352
[Birdsong] Men, take a knee and bow.

01:43:28.461 --> 01:43:30.053
[in Italian] God Almighty.

01:43:30.096 --> 01:43:32.963
[in German] The tree of life blossoms
beside the shore of still waters.

01:43:32.998 --> 01:43:38.300
The face of Christ is shining,
and it needs no candle, no light...

01:43:38.337 --> 01:43:40.601
[in Italian] Nor Sun.

01:43:40.639 --> 01:43:43.233
There is no suffering in your Kingdom.

01:43:43.275 --> 01:43:46.335
And we ask for your forgiveness
merciful Father...

01:43:46.379 --> 01:43:49.212
[in German] that we have not seen
the light before this day.

01:43:49.248 --> 01:43:51.341
For your light reigns forever.

01:43:51.384 --> 01:43:54.012
It is a shining beacon that lights
the path to your heavenly throne.

01:43:54.053 --> 01:43:57.318
[Birdsong] I may not be the man
that you want me to be, O Lord.

01:43:57.356 --> 01:44:00.189
I may not be the man that
I should have been, O God.

01:44:00.226 --> 01:44:02.160
[in German] But we are your people.

01:44:02.194 --> 01:44:06.824
[in Italian] We ask you, Lord, to walk
with us in our pain and our suffering.

01:44:06.866 --> 01:44:09.699
...as a nation of your children
who glorify your name...

01:44:09.735 --> 01:44:11.293
[in Italian] in victory.

01:44:11.337 --> 01:44:13.567
- Amen.
- [all] Amen.

01:44:13.606 --> 01:44:15.005
[all] Amen.

01:44:25.050 --> 01:44:26.244
Amen.

01:44:29.021 --> 01:44:31.489
- [distant explosion]
- [gasps]

01:44:31.524 --> 01:44:33.754
Easy, boy.

01:44:33.793 --> 01:44:37.559
Ain't got to go jumpin'
every hank and rustle come along.

01:44:37.596 --> 01:44:39.723
Here. Go on.

01:44:39.765 --> 01:44:41.357
Yeah.

01:44:46.172 --> 01:44:49.869
Hey. You, uh...

01:44:49.909 --> 01:44:54.278
You still tryin' to hump
that piece of shit off on somebody?

01:44:54.313 --> 01:44:57.680
You ought not use them type
of bad words around the boy, Bishop.

01:44:59.318 --> 01:45:01.479
Shit.

01:45:01.520 --> 01:45:03.454
He don't understand.

01:45:05.157 --> 01:45:07.148
Go on inside, boy. Go on.

01:45:11.197 --> 01:45:14.724
How about all that preachin'
you do back home, Bishop?

01:45:14.767 --> 01:45:16.860
Don't you believe in God?

01:45:20.806 --> 01:45:23.934
Well, now, I believes in it
at the time I'm preachin' it.

01:45:25.544 --> 01:45:27.739
Then I don't believe in it no more.

01:45:30.583 --> 01:45:34.952
Hell, now I just believe in the pictures
of old white men on green paper.

01:45:34.987 --> 01:45:37.478
Well, that ain't no way to live.

01:45:37.523 --> 01:45:39.787
You know, God don't like ugly, Bishop.

01:45:39.825 --> 01:45:42.293
He ain't too fond of pretty, either.

01:45:47.800 --> 01:45:50.200
Train, why you think...

01:45:50.236 --> 01:45:54.332
Why you think God allow all this killin'
all over the world to happen?

01:45:54.373 --> 01:45:56.500
- [distant explosion]
- Hmm?

01:46:01.747 --> 01:46:04.079
See?

01:46:04.116 --> 01:46:06.607
See, that's why I don't believe in him.

01:46:10.356 --> 01:46:13.757
Well, if you don't believe in
him, Bishop Cummings, then...

01:46:13.792 --> 01:46:17.785
...why you care about whether or not God
the one allowin' all the killin'?

01:46:24.904 --> 01:46:26.462
Man...

01:46:27.773 --> 01:46:30.105
Man, you startin' to sound
like my mama now.

01:46:30.142 --> 01:46:31.632
[laughs]

01:46:31.677 --> 01:46:34.043
Your mama alive, Bishop?

01:46:34.079 --> 01:46:39.039
Train, mind your own goddamn business,
boy. You hear me?

01:46:39.084 --> 01:46:42.645
Yeah, I'm sorry, buddy.
I didn't, uh...

01:46:42.688 --> 01:46:45.020
I didn't mean nothin'
by it, Bishop.

01:46:45.057 --> 01:46:49.187
Is your God gonna get us
back home? In one piece?

01:46:49.228 --> 01:46:52.197
Is he?

01:46:53.933 --> 01:46:56.766
If the Lord is willin'
and the creek don't rise.

01:47:02.241 --> 01:47:04.607
Hey, Renata.

01:47:08.781 --> 01:47:12.808
- Where you headed?
- Your boss wants you.

01:47:12.851 --> 01:47:16.582
Nah. Nah, no boss, OK?

01:47:19.625 --> 01:47:21.855
Girl, let me trim your garden.

01:47:24.697 --> 01:47:26.927
What do you mean?

01:47:26.966 --> 01:47:30.367
<i>Signora, shakin' hands with you
is like touchin' a flamethrower.</i>

01:47:32.137 --> 01:47:35.971
You fine as wine and as silk as milk.

01:47:41.080 --> 01:47:45.210
You like dancin'? You like jazz?

01:47:46.585 --> 01:47:50.544
- You ever heard of Count Basie?
- Count of Basie?

01:47:52.391 --> 01:47:53.449
Where is this?

01:47:54.860 --> 01:47:56.725
Mm-hm.

01:48:25.924 --> 01:48:28.154
Want a Camel cigarette?

01:48:30.396 --> 01:48:31.829
[speaks Italian] Come in.

01:49:16.108 --> 01:49:19.441
You didn't know that the Germans
raised the price on your head.

01:49:19.478 --> 01:49:21.810
From 50,000 lire to 100,000 lire...

01:49:21.847 --> 01:49:23.246
and a bag of salt.

01:49:23.282 --> 01:49:24.681
Not bad!

01:49:26.151 --> 01:49:30.918
But you saw, no one
from the village turned you in.

01:49:32.157 --> 01:49:34.921
Not even
the Fascist Ludovico...

01:49:34.960 --> 01:49:38.191
who's so stingy he keeps his money
in his underpants.

01:49:38.230 --> 01:49:39.356
Not even Ludovico?

01:49:40.466 --> 01:49:41.694
Not even Ludovico.

01:49:41.734 --> 01:49:43.531
If they only knew who I am,

01:49:45.137 --> 01:49:46.934
what I've done,

01:49:49.742 --> 01:49:51.903
they'd pull my heart out of my chest.

01:49:52.611 --> 01:49:53.703
Peppi.

01:49:56.448 --> 01:49:59.076
What's tormenting you so much?

01:49:59.118 --> 01:50:01.245
We surprised a German Patrol...

01:50:01.286 --> 01:50:04.187
[speaking German]
My little son Robert loves the rain.

01:50:04.223 --> 01:50:06.157
My little Anna hates it.

01:50:06.191 --> 01:50:07.590
Shut up you two!

01:50:07.626 --> 01:50:08.684
Yes, Sir.

01:50:17.402 --> 01:50:19.233
[in Italian] Where are you going?

01:50:19.271 --> 01:50:20.738
Where are you going?

01:50:23.809 --> 01:50:25.140
[screams]

01:50:25.177 --> 01:50:26.269
I'll slaughter you.

01:50:30.783 --> 01:50:32.250
Do you hear me?

01:50:32.284 --> 01:50:34.377
Do you hear me?
I'll slaughter you.

01:50:38.190 --> 01:50:40.249
How many times do you
want to kill him?

01:50:41.794 --> 01:50:43.489
He's already dead.

01:50:56.975 --> 01:50:58.670
Look what I found.

01:50:59.545 --> 01:51:00.671
Here.

01:51:00.712 --> 01:51:02.509
I'll keep this
for my family.

01:51:02.548 --> 01:51:03.845
My daughter is hungry.

01:51:03.882 --> 01:51:05.941
At least
I can give her food.

01:51:05.984 --> 01:51:07.008
Take this.

01:51:09.421 --> 01:51:11.480
This money is
stained with blood.

01:51:12.658 --> 01:51:14.421
We're suppose
to catch the thieves...

01:51:14.459 --> 01:51:16.086
not become them.

01:51:16.128 --> 01:51:18.062
Let's not start a war
between ourselves.

01:51:18.096 --> 01:51:20.690
What's that got to do with it?

01:51:20.732 --> 01:51:22.324
I gave you
three years of blood.

01:51:22.367 --> 01:51:23.595
To Italy and to him.

01:51:23.635 --> 01:51:25.125
Three years of blood.

01:51:25.170 --> 01:51:28.731
You're a Fascist and you'll
always be one, like Marco.

01:51:28.774 --> 01:51:29.798
Here.

01:51:29.842 --> 01:51:31.742
Take your money and go home.

01:51:31.777 --> 01:51:33.677
I will take it home.

01:51:36.782 --> 01:51:38.181
I will take it.

01:51:38.917 --> 01:51:40.043
Go, go, go.

01:51:40.085 --> 01:51:41.575
Go!

01:51:54.867 --> 01:51:56.300
It's finished here.

01:51:59.137 --> 01:52:01.469
You'll pay for this.

01:52:03.876 --> 01:52:06.003
The Germans were blinded by rage.

01:52:06.044 --> 01:52:08.808
We had been attacking
them for months. They were furious.

01:52:09.848 --> 01:52:12.510
They combed the mountains
looking for us.

01:52:12.551 --> 01:52:13.848
We had to hide.

01:52:13.886 --> 01:52:15.217
We could have starved to death.

01:52:22.561 --> 01:52:24.893
[in German] Nobody there.

01:52:24.930 --> 01:52:27.023
[Peppi, in Italian]
A fellow Partisan saved us.

01:52:27.065 --> 01:52:28.930
Paselli was her name.

01:52:49.821 --> 01:52:52.688
She was the one who told me what
happened at St. Anna di Stazzema.

01:52:53.625 --> 01:52:55.923
- Eat.
- Thank you.

01:52:55.961 --> 01:52:57.826
I had sent the others to Serravezza.

01:52:57.863 --> 01:53:00.957
I had to meet one of our men
who had gone to look for supplies.

01:53:03.702 --> 01:53:06.068
But then, because of the storm,
I had to stay in the mountains.

01:53:06.104 --> 01:53:08.834
They marched into St. Anna.

01:53:08.874 --> 01:53:12.173
They gathered hundreds of people,

01:53:12.210 --> 01:53:14.041
- women,
- children,

01:53:14.079 --> 01:53:15.410
children and old people.

01:53:18.283 --> 01:53:19.841
There were also refugees.

01:53:19.885 --> 01:53:22.353
They grouped them in the Square.

01:53:22.387 --> 01:53:23.786
In front of the Church.

01:53:26.792 --> 01:53:28.885
[speaking Italian] One of you...

01:53:30.796 --> 01:53:32.457
knows...

01:53:32.497 --> 01:53:35.125
- where he is.
- [baby crying]

01:53:36.168 --> 01:53:38.398
One of you...

01:53:40.339 --> 01:53:42.000
has seen...

01:53:42.040 --> 01:53:43.064
him.

01:53:44.910 --> 01:53:45.934
So...

01:53:47.913 --> 01:53:49.278
speak.

01:53:53.218 --> 01:53:54.810
Everyone's quiet.

01:53:59.925 --> 01:54:01.324
They don't know anything.

01:54:01.360 --> 01:54:02.657
They're innocent.

01:54:02.694 --> 01:54:03.820
They don't know anything.

01:54:03.862 --> 01:54:06.330
I gave you fifteen minutes...

01:54:06.365 --> 01:54:07.798
They're innocent.

01:54:07.833 --> 01:54:11.667
to find someone who would tell us...

01:54:11.703 --> 01:54:13.068
They don't know.

01:54:13.105 --> 01:54:16.268
where is the hideout of the Butterfly?

01:54:16.308 --> 01:54:17.866
- They don't know.
- And his Bandits.

01:54:17.909 --> 01:54:19.570
Take only my life.

01:54:19.611 --> 01:54:20.703
I beg you.

01:54:20.746 --> 01:54:23.613
You still have one minute.

01:54:32.958 --> 01:54:33.982
Kneel.

01:54:35.894 --> 01:54:38.089
In the name of the Father...

01:54:38.130 --> 01:54:39.427
And the Son...

01:54:39.464 --> 01:54:41.329
and the Holy Ghost.

01:54:43.135 --> 01:54:45.763
[all] Our Father who art in Heaven,

01:54:45.804 --> 01:54:48.329
hallowed be Thy name,

01:54:48.373 --> 01:54:50.170
Thy Kingdom come,

01:54:50.208 --> 01:54:52.369
Thy will be done,

01:54:53.979 --> 01:54:55.344
On Earth...

01:54:55.380 --> 01:54:57.848
as it is in Heaven.

01:54:57.883 --> 01:55:01.182
- Give us this day our daily bread.
- [sobbing]

01:55:01.219 --> 01:55:04.188
Forgive us for our trespasses,

01:55:04.222 --> 01:55:06.690
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

01:55:07.592 --> 01:55:10.584
Lead us not into temptation.

01:55:10.629 --> 01:55:12.722
But deliver us from Evil.

01:55:13.465 --> 01:55:16.195
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:55:16.234 --> 01:55:17.496
[speaking German] I understand.

01:55:17.536 --> 01:55:19.470
- Is there something?
- Yes, Sir...

01:55:19.504 --> 01:55:21.870
There are orders from headquarters.

01:55:22.908 --> 01:55:23.932
Yes?

01:55:25.911 --> 01:55:26.935
It will be done.

01:55:51.036 --> 01:55:52.094
[speaking Italian] Father.

01:55:52.838 --> 01:55:54.135
Forgive them...

01:55:54.172 --> 01:55:55.969
for they know not what they do.

01:56:54.533 --> 01:56:55.727
[in Italian] They...

01:56:55.767 --> 01:56:59.669
killed so many,

01:57:01.106 --> 01:57:02.869
that they ran out of ammunition.

01:57:24.462 --> 01:57:25.690
[crying stops]

01:57:27.566 --> 01:57:29.124
[Peppi] They burnt so many...

01:57:30.168 --> 01:57:33.228
[Paselli] they ran out of fuel.

01:57:36.208 --> 01:57:38.301
[in Italian] What has happened here...

01:57:41.079 --> 01:57:43.309
everything that's happened...

01:57:44.649 --> 01:57:47.015
is your fault.

01:57:47.052 --> 01:57:50.544
You promised to bring The Butterfly.

01:57:50.589 --> 01:57:52.682
- He told me he would be here.
- No. No. I don't care!

01:57:52.724 --> 01:57:54.419
- I know these people.
- You will pay for this!

01:57:54.459 --> 01:57:56.290
They have nothing to do with it.

01:57:56.328 --> 01:57:58.626
[Bergmann] Rodolfo, we had a deal.

01:57:58.663 --> 01:58:00.460
[Rodolfo] No, I kept my deal.

01:58:00.498 --> 01:58:02.159
I brought him here.

01:58:02.200 --> 01:58:06.034
[Bergmann] But you promised me,
my dear Rodolfo.

01:58:06.071 --> 01:58:07.629
You Italians don't know
how to keep a deal.

01:58:07.672 --> 01:58:10.266
[Rodolfo] I betrayed my people.
I'll burn in Hell because of you.

01:58:10.308 --> 01:58:13.744
[Bergmann] You worthless Italians.

01:58:13.778 --> 01:58:15.712
You will pay for this!

01:58:15.747 --> 01:58:17.442
All of you Italians will pay for this!

01:58:17.482 --> 01:58:19.450
Mama!

01:58:19.484 --> 01:58:20.610
Mama!

01:58:20.652 --> 01:58:21.983
Mama!

01:58:22.020 --> 01:58:23.647
[Hans] Arturo! Arturo!

01:58:23.688 --> 01:58:24.916
No!

01:58:24.956 --> 01:58:26.890
No! Stop! Stop!

01:58:26.925 --> 01:58:28.153
Run! Run!

01:58:28.193 --> 01:58:29.217
Run!

01:58:29.261 --> 01:58:30.285
Run!

01:58:31.496 --> 01:58:32.520
Child murderer!

01:58:41.306 --> 01:58:42.796
[in German] Bloody traitor!

01:58:44.509 --> 01:58:46.238
Come on!

01:58:46.278 --> 01:58:47.609
Move!

01:58:47.646 --> 01:58:49.045
Move! Move! Move!

01:58:55.987 --> 01:58:57.454
Bring him back!

01:58:59.124 --> 01:59:00.148
Go!

01:59:07.666 --> 01:59:09.133
[Bergmann] Finish him!

01:59:09.167 --> 01:59:10.657
Kill him!

01:59:14.873 --> 01:59:17.000
[man] Move, move.
We can't go back without him.

01:59:21.046 --> 01:59:22.308
[man 2] Where's that swine?

01:59:22.347 --> 01:59:23.371
[man 3] Over there.

01:59:30.855 --> 01:59:33.380
[Peppi, in Italian] Even if
I live a hundred years...

01:59:33.425 --> 01:59:35.359
I've been dead from that day on.

01:59:35.393 --> 01:59:36.792
Peppi.

01:59:39.364 --> 01:59:42.094
You need a lot more courage
to live than to die.

01:59:43.368 --> 01:59:46.303
But listen to me.

01:59:46.338 --> 01:59:48.602
You have to accept the truth.

01:59:48.640 --> 01:59:51.609
Someone betrayed you.

01:59:51.643 --> 01:59:54.840
And you have to find the traitor.

01:59:56.915 --> 01:59:58.473
Only thing I know...

02:00:00.452 --> 02:00:03.979
The Germans were wrong
to provoke The Sleeping Man.

02:00:05.623 --> 02:00:07.386
Because, you'll see...

02:00:07.425 --> 02:00:08.517
In the end,

02:00:08.560 --> 02:00:10.187
he'll protect us.

02:00:11.296 --> 02:00:12.991
He'll protect his land.

02:00:22.974 --> 02:00:24.532
[in Spanish] I'm done.

02:00:26.111 --> 02:00:28.045
I shit on Hitler's mother.

02:00:32.617 --> 02:00:36.713
If I were in San Juan,
I'd eat a good plate of rice and beans.

02:00:36.755 --> 02:00:38.484
And a sweetie pie for dessert.

02:00:42.460 --> 02:00:44.553
[muffled screams]

02:00:54.205 --> 02:00:55.331
Who is he?

02:00:56.541 --> 02:00:58.566
[speaking German]
I'll meet that swine...

02:00:59.110 --> 02:01:01.271
in Hell.

02:01:01.312 --> 02:01:02.711
I don't understand.

02:01:07.986 --> 02:01:09.783
No, no, no. Come on.

02:01:35.847 --> 02:01:37.872
[speaking Italian] Where's the German?

02:01:37.916 --> 02:01:42.512
The Americans took him
and they kicked me out. I told you so.

02:01:44.823 --> 02:01:47.621
We have to get out of here right away.

02:01:47.659 --> 02:01:50.890
It's full of Germans making their way
down The Sleeping Man.

02:01:50.929 --> 02:01:52.658
The Germans have lost, everyone knows.

02:01:52.697 --> 02:01:55.666
What are you talking about?
He who made the mistake must pay.

02:01:55.700 --> 02:01:56.758
Rodolfo...

02:01:56.801 --> 02:01:59.429
Ludovico's not the traitor anyway.

02:02:00.572 --> 02:02:02.665
We'll find him. Trust me.

02:02:11.850 --> 02:02:13.442
[laughs]

02:02:13.485 --> 02:02:16.010
Do you remember the time...

02:02:16.054 --> 02:02:18.318
when Marco spent the week
staring at the Mountain...

02:02:18.356 --> 02:02:21.814
convinced that
The Sleeping Man would awaken?

02:02:23.161 --> 02:02:25.186
And how my mother yelled at him!

02:02:27.899 --> 02:02:29.457
Of course I remember.

02:02:29.501 --> 02:02:30.991
Sleep. Sleep.

02:02:32.704 --> 02:02:34.035
Marco's dead.

02:02:35.540 --> 02:02:37.531
I killed him.

02:02:37.575 --> 02:02:40.100
In a firefight with
his Fascist comrades.

02:02:40.144 --> 02:02:43.011
He would've done the same to me!

02:02:43.047 --> 02:02:44.947
Because we're Partisans.

02:02:46.784 --> 02:02:49.252
There's nothing left to see here.

02:02:53.057 --> 02:02:54.547
Peppi...

02:02:55.927 --> 02:02:59.988
Listen, if someone commits a sin...

02:03:00.031 --> 02:03:01.862
a big sin...

02:03:06.070 --> 02:03:07.970
and then he repents...

02:03:08.640 --> 02:03:10.073
and confesses.

02:03:11.342 --> 02:03:13.606
do you think he'll go to Hell?

02:03:15.179 --> 02:03:17.306
I don't know. I'm not a Priest.

02:03:18.316 --> 02:03:19.874
What have you become?

02:03:20.752 --> 02:03:22.344
I don't recognize you anymore.

02:03:22.387 --> 02:03:25.322
You are here rationalizing.

02:03:25.356 --> 02:03:29.156
Always talking about my dead brother.
What do you want from me?

02:03:30.795 --> 02:03:33.593
Do you want to know
who betrayed you at St. Anna?

02:03:33.631 --> 02:03:36.395
We should have kept the German
instead of giving him to the Americans.

02:03:36.434 --> 02:03:38.902
Maybe we'd have discovered
that he can speak Italian.

02:03:38.937 --> 02:03:40.837
Maybe he would have spoke of you.

02:03:44.809 --> 02:03:48.142
We've known each other a lifetime,
and you think it was me?

02:03:48.179 --> 02:03:50.579
This is war, Peppi.

02:03:50.615 --> 02:03:53.106
And in war people suffer; people die!

02:03:53.151 --> 02:03:56.587
So, do you think the people at St. Anna
had to die because this is war?

02:03:57.655 --> 02:03:59.282
I didn't say that!

02:03:59.324 --> 02:04:00.621
I trusted you.

02:04:00.658 --> 02:04:04.617
It was you that I had
to meet to get supplies.

02:04:04.662 --> 02:04:08.154
It was you who suggested
St. Anna was a safe place.

02:04:08.199 --> 02:04:09.894
What did you want to do?

02:04:11.169 --> 02:04:12.830
Did you want revenge
because I killed your brother?

02:04:12.870 --> 02:04:14.337
For the last time...

02:04:14.372 --> 02:04:15.805
You should've told me,
then I would have let them only kill me.

02:04:15.840 --> 02:04:17.808
Stop talking about my dead brother.

02:04:17.842 --> 02:04:20.003
You killed him!

02:04:20.044 --> 02:04:23.070
Hundreds of innocent people.

02:04:23.114 --> 02:04:24.706
You sent me to Hell...

02:04:48.673 --> 02:04:50.038
[in Italian] Bastard!

02:04:50.074 --> 02:04:51.234
Bastard!

02:05:00.685 --> 02:05:02.118
Stamps!

02:05:02.954 --> 02:05:04.546
Stamps!

02:05:05.923 --> 02:05:08.585
- We got problems.
- Where you been?

02:05:08.626 --> 02:05:09.718
Where's the Jerry?

02:05:09.761 --> 02:05:11.422
That son of a bitch
Rodolfo slit his throat.

02:05:11.462 --> 02:05:13.293
Then he killed Peppi.

02:05:13.331 --> 02:05:15.891
- What happened to your neck?
- He tried to kill me.

02:05:15.933 --> 02:05:18.731
- He was no good.
- Roll before the heavy mail comes.

02:05:18.770 --> 02:05:21.238
Go get a bandage. Go get your radio.

02:05:24.709 --> 02:05:27.075
Bishop! Where's your weapon?

02:05:29.047 --> 02:05:30.480
I'm here.

02:05:32.016 --> 02:05:34.314
- Where's Siegfried?
- The Italian killed him.

02:05:34.352 --> 02:05:35.546
No shit?

02:05:37.855 --> 02:05:39.482
Nokes still comin', ain't he?

02:05:39.524 --> 02:05:42.652
Get your gear, get to
Old Man Loody's house on the double.

02:05:42.694 --> 02:05:45.322
Hadn't sent that doofus over,
we wouldn't be here.

02:05:45.363 --> 02:05:47.923
I ain't send that dense
nigga no place. Bullshit.

02:05:47.965 --> 02:05:51.594
What you done is worse.
Beat the man out of the 1,400 chips.

02:06:42.053 --> 02:06:45.420
That tight pussy was on its own
so long it needed to be adopted.

02:06:45.456 --> 02:06:46.753
Talk!

02:06:58.236 --> 02:06:59.601
I'll kill you!

02:07:08.212 --> 02:07:12.114
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!
I'll make you swallow that gold tooth!

02:07:12.150 --> 02:07:13.947
- Hey! Get off him!
- What?

02:07:13.985 --> 02:07:17.648
I said get off! Nokes is here!

02:07:17.688 --> 02:07:20.748
- Nokes is here!
- Get off me!

02:07:20.792 --> 02:07:22.885
Kill yourselves on your own time.

02:07:49.620 --> 02:07:52.714
Hey, boys. Which one of you's Stamps?

02:07:52.757 --> 02:07:55.590
- Sir.
- Did ya get that goddamn Kraut fucker?

02:07:55.626 --> 02:07:58.186
- Captain...
- I don't wanna hear shit other than

02:07:58.229 --> 02:08:02.632
how the fuck you ended up miles on
the wrong side of this goddamn valley.

02:08:02.667 --> 02:08:04.692
Kraut's around the corner there.

02:08:06.270 --> 02:08:08.465
Birdsong, find out what his problem is

02:08:08.506 --> 02:08:10.633
while I go get the goose-stepper.

02:08:10.675 --> 02:08:13.838
Stamps, you got two minutes
to get your balls out of a sling.

02:08:16.214 --> 02:08:20.173
- Get rid of that kid.
- I've been trying to, sir.

02:08:20.218 --> 02:08:23.881
But I guess he don't wanna let me go.
He's a nice little fella.

02:08:23.921 --> 02:08:27.516
- Ain't he cute?
- I said get rid of him.

02:08:27.558 --> 02:08:32.586
I don't know what to do with him, sir.
I ain't gonna leave him.

02:08:32.630 --> 02:08:35.098
So I figure to take him along.

02:08:35.132 --> 02:08:39.831
He don't talk much, but he do tap.
See here? Watch this here.

02:08:39.871 --> 02:08:43.272
- I do this, and then...
- What the fuck is wrong with you?

02:08:43.307 --> 02:08:46.208
Spent two days risking
our asses gettin' here for you.

02:08:46.244 --> 02:08:49.771
It's good men, white men in this man's
army holding back that attack,

02:08:49.814 --> 02:08:52.647
and you gonna talk to me
about some damn dago wop kid?

02:08:55.353 --> 02:08:58.845
- I feel sorry for him, sir.
- You feel sorry for him?

02:09:00.324 --> 02:09:02.815
OK.

02:09:05.830 --> 02:09:10.494
OK, button up, get in the Jeep,
and let's get the fuck out of here.

02:09:12.303 --> 02:09:15.761
Ain't no cause for that kind of talk
in front of no child, sir.

02:09:15.806 --> 02:09:18.741
You ain't got to make him cry now, sir.

02:09:18.776 --> 02:09:20.641
- No.
- Cool it, Diesel.

02:09:20.678 --> 02:09:23.169
Nobody gonna talk to my boy like that.

02:09:23.214 --> 02:09:27.310
Cussin' and thumpin' and yellin'
and carryin' on. Spittin'.

02:09:27.351 --> 02:09:31.014
- Easy, big fella.
- He's a child, sir.

02:09:31.055 --> 02:09:35.719
Sir. Sir. Train got a mind of his own.

02:09:35.760 --> 02:09:40.060
It was my idea to bring the kid.
We got him down at the Serchio River.

02:09:40.097 --> 02:09:44.295
The fact is the kid won't leave us.
I told Train to take him.

02:09:44.335 --> 02:09:46.269
Mm-hm.

02:09:47.605 --> 02:09:49.334
You handle your men.

02:09:50.841 --> 02:09:52.468
Move.

02:09:52.510 --> 02:09:55.707
- Captain Nokes got a filthy mouth.
- Come here.

02:09:56.847 --> 02:09:59.247
- Renata.
- Come here! Train.

02:09:59.283 --> 02:10:02.184
Give the kid to Loosey-Goosey.
She'll do a fine job.

02:10:02.219 --> 02:10:05.245
- She ain't his mama.
- I know, but you gotta give him up.

02:10:05.289 --> 02:10:09.453
She don't know him good as I do. I got a
granny back home who'll raise him right.

02:10:09.493 --> 02:10:13.122
- Train, give him to me. Please.
- Sarge.

02:10:14.231 --> 02:10:15.698
[in Italian] Come here. Come to me.

02:10:15.733 --> 02:10:17.894
- He don't wanna go.
- [Renata] Come to me, please.

02:10:17.935 --> 02:10:20.733
This some kind of fuckin' minstrel show?

02:10:28.112 --> 02:10:30.376
Move! Get out of my goddamn way!

02:10:30.414 --> 02:10:34.282
Get out of my goddamn way! Move!

02:10:38.289 --> 02:10:41.622
This Kraut fucker's dead!
From the crew cut down.

02:10:41.659 --> 02:10:43.388
How did he get that way?

02:10:45.629 --> 02:10:47.654
I guess somebody killed him, sir.

02:10:47.698 --> 02:10:51.532
I can see that, Staff Sergeant Stamps.
But how did he get killed?

02:10:51.569 --> 02:10:53.833
- Didn't you put a man on him?
- I did.

02:10:53.871 --> 02:10:56.305
- The Partisan killed him.
- Dropped the ball!

02:10:56.340 --> 02:11:00.936
You dropped the fuckin' ball!
You fucked up big time.

02:11:00.978 --> 02:11:03.811
Now, all four of you
gonna be court-martialed.

02:11:03.848 --> 02:11:07.079
One, two, three and four.

02:11:07.118 --> 02:11:09.985
Sir, we gotta pull out now.

02:11:10.921 --> 02:11:13.048
Now, you load up, soldier.

02:11:15.259 --> 02:11:18.592
About this child? If I could
just get a word with you about...

02:11:18.629 --> 02:11:23.464
For the last time, soldier. I told you
to get in that goddamn Jeep.

02:11:23.501 --> 02:11:25.901
Ain't no need to shoot
the man over no child.

02:11:25.936 --> 02:11:28.234
We can take him to headquarters.
We got room.

02:11:28.272 --> 02:11:30.832
Yeah. Ain't no trouble.
We can take the kid.

02:11:30.875 --> 02:11:34.777
Lieutenant Birdsong,
you take that goddamn kid.

02:11:34.812 --> 02:11:38.077
- Huh?
- You heard me.

02:11:40.117 --> 02:11:42.381
Don't make it tough on me,
big fella.

02:11:42.420 --> 02:11:45.355
You better not
come no closer.

02:11:47.391 --> 02:11:48.790
Wouldn't do that, sir.

02:11:50.661 --> 02:11:52.856
- [Bishop] Choke him, Train!
- Train, for God's sake!

02:11:54.465 --> 02:11:57.093
- [Bishop] Choke that tar.
- [Hector] Put him down.

02:11:57.134 --> 02:11:58.658
[Nokes] Soldier, put him down!

02:11:58.702 --> 02:12:00.727
[Hector] He's had enough.
Put him down.

02:12:00.771 --> 02:12:02.762
[Bishop] Choke the shit
out of that fucker!

02:12:02.807 --> 02:12:04.866
[Nokes] Put him down right this second!

02:12:04.909 --> 02:12:07.275
[Angelo, in Italian] Chocolate Giant!

02:12:07.311 --> 02:12:08.869
The Sleeping Man.

02:12:08.913 --> 02:12:12.474
- Diesel, you're killing 'im.
- Put him down!

02:12:12.516 --> 02:12:13.915
[Bishop] Leave him be, Stamps.

02:12:13.951 --> 02:12:15.316
[Nokes] That's right, big fella.

02:12:15.352 --> 02:12:18.810
- Birdsong! Son, you OK?
- Crazy black bastard!

02:12:18.856 --> 02:12:20.653
- Come here.
- Help me get him.

02:12:20.691 --> 02:12:22.283
[in Italian] Get back. Get back.

02:12:22.326 --> 02:12:23.850
Let me take him.

02:12:25.062 --> 02:12:28.259
- I'll see you again, Stamps.
- I hope so.

02:12:31.569 --> 02:12:33.560
- Come on!
- Let's move out! Let's go!

02:12:36.540 --> 02:12:37.973
Come on. Let's move out.

02:12:41.479 --> 02:12:43.003
[people screaming]

02:12:49.353 --> 02:12:50.945
It's the Germans!

02:13:05.736 --> 02:13:07.704
[Ludovico] Natalina!

02:13:07.738 --> 02:13:09.968
Go! Go! Go!

02:13:10.007 --> 02:13:11.634
Natalina!

02:13:14.345 --> 02:13:16.245
[in Italian] Come away. Come with me.

02:13:27.191 --> 02:13:30.217
Hector! Go get Ludovico! Go!

02:13:33.264 --> 02:13:34.697
Wait!

02:13:38.636 --> 02:13:40.763
Bishop! Cover me!

02:13:40.804 --> 02:13:41.828
Go, go, go!

02:13:48.312 --> 02:13:49.779
Ludovico!

02:13:50.881 --> 02:13:52.644
Natalina!

02:14:01.258 --> 02:14:04.091
<i>Papa! Papa!</i>

02:14:17.508 --> 02:14:19.908
Bishop! Bishop!

02:14:21.245 --> 02:14:22.405
Bishop!

02:14:25.049 --> 02:14:27.643
Bishop! Bishop!

02:14:28.953 --> 02:14:30.045
Train!

02:14:50.774 --> 02:14:52.571
[shouting in German] Forward! Forward!

02:14:52.610 --> 02:14:54.043
Spread out!

02:14:54.078 --> 02:14:55.909
Move! Spread out!

02:14:55.946 --> 02:14:58.278
Forward. Be alert.

02:15:10.728 --> 02:15:13.424
Jesus Lord, Bishop,
I can't move my head.

02:15:13.464 --> 02:15:15.591
- Is my boy livin'?
- Yeah.

02:15:15.633 --> 02:15:16.964
Is he livin'?

02:15:17.001 --> 02:15:19.595
He just got a little scratch,
but he gonna be OK.

02:15:19.637 --> 02:15:22.071
That's good. That's good.

02:15:24.808 --> 02:15:27.333
Tell Hector to put that
little old cross on him.

02:15:27.378 --> 02:15:30.745
- Let him know who his daddy is.
- OK.

02:15:30.781 --> 02:15:34.478
[gasping] Here. Take this.

02:15:42.593 --> 02:15:46.689
Uh-huh. You seen it the whole time,
didn't you, Bishop?

02:15:48.032 --> 02:15:51.695
I knew it. I knew it...

02:15:55.773 --> 02:15:59.573
Train, I'm gonna take this kid,
and I'm gonna come back for you.

02:15:59.610 --> 02:16:01.339
I'm gonna come right back for you.

02:16:01.378 --> 02:16:03.243
All right. I'll be right here.

02:16:07.484 --> 02:16:09.611
[in Italian] Liberty!

02:16:21.632 --> 02:16:23.827
I'm gonna come
right back for you.

02:16:28.639 --> 02:16:29.867
Damn!

02:16:43.253 --> 02:16:44.447

02:17:36.507 --> 02:17:37.871
[man] Move, move, move.

02:17:38.475 --> 02:17:40.875
Lock down the village. Move!

02:17:42.646 --> 02:17:43.907
Clear the buildings!

02:17:45.915 --> 02:17:47.576
Come on, kill the Blacks!

02:17:47.618 --> 02:17:49.245
Those pigs. This way.

02:17:49.286 --> 02:17:50.309
Over there.

02:17:56.794 --> 02:17:58.192

Get down!

02:19:02.493 --> 02:19:04.050

[in Italian] Angelo.

02:20:12.095 --> 02:20:14.063
Angelo.

02:20:14.097 --> 02:20:15.621
You're not dead anymore.

02:20:15.666 --> 02:20:18.066
Open your eyes.

02:20:18.101 --> 02:20:19.432
Angelo.

02:20:23.407 --> 02:20:25.841
Arturo, where am I?

02:20:25.876 --> 02:20:27.173
It's not important.

02:20:27.210 --> 02:20:29.201
We have to go.

02:20:29.246 --> 02:20:30.873
Am I going to Heaven?

02:20:30.914 --> 02:20:32.643
No, you're going home.

02:20:32.683 --> 02:20:33.775
Where's my home?

02:20:33.817 --> 02:20:35.682
Angelo, I'll show you.

02:20:35.719 --> 02:20:37.050
Who's there?

02:20:37.087 --> 02:20:39.487
Your Papa. Remember him?

02:20:40.857 --> 02:20:42.222
What about my friend...

02:20:42.259 --> 02:20:44.090
the Chocolate Giant?

02:21:00.444 --> 02:21:01.968
You have to remember him,

02:21:02.813 --> 02:21:04.303
me,

02:21:04.348 --> 02:21:06.282
all of this.

02:21:06.316 --> 02:21:08.784
This was our time to be children.

02:21:35.579 --> 02:21:36.603
[in Italian] Come here.

02:22:15.285 --> 02:22:16.752
[in German] Prepare to die.

02:22:18.221 --> 02:22:19.711
This is over.

02:22:19.756 --> 02:22:21.485
Gather the wounded...

02:22:21.525 --> 02:22:22.924
and bury our dead.

02:22:22.959 --> 02:22:24.756
Let's go.

02:22:24.795 --> 02:22:26.422
Let's go.

02:22:26.463 --> 02:22:27.521
Let's go.

02:22:41.678 --> 02:22:43.236
Defend yourself.

02:23:12.776 --> 02:23:16.177
- Medic! We need you right now!
- Right here.

02:23:16.213 --> 02:23:17.703
Guys, we need a hand.

02:23:22.719 --> 02:23:25.153
Stand by. Lift!

02:23:37.400 --> 02:23:40.233
[man] Easy, y'all. Real easy.

02:23:40.270 --> 02:23:44.434
It's gonna be OK, Hector. You're going
back home to New York, man.

02:23:52.849 --> 02:23:55.113
[man 2] Reconnaissance photos
were accurate.

02:23:55.152 --> 02:23:58.212
General Almond wouldn't listen.
Go get those dog tags.

02:23:58.255 --> 02:23:59.552
[man 3] Yes, sir.

02:23:59.589 --> 02:24:01.784
[man 2] I need a full report,
on the double.

02:24:03.326 --> 02:24:05.886
- [man 3] "Stamps, Aubrey."
- [man 4] Got it.

02:24:07.898 --> 02:24:10.594
- [man 3] "Cummings, Bishop."
- [man 4] Check.

02:24:13.670 --> 02:24:16.138
- [man 3] "Train, Samuel."
- [man 4] Got it.

02:24:23.547 --> 02:24:26.641
Well done, corporal.
You earned yourself a Purple Heart.

02:24:26.683 --> 02:24:29.117
- Get this man to the aid station.
- Yes, sir!

02:24:29.152 --> 02:24:30.676
Detail.

02:24:38.461 --> 02:24:41.396
[Tim] Come on, Mr. Negron.
You're clean as a board of health.

02:24:41.431 --> 02:24:46.960
You got no kids, no debts. No enemies.
Four years in the service. Purple Heart.

02:24:47.003 --> 02:24:52.134
Why stick a German Luger in a guy's
chest three months short of retirement?

02:24:53.343 --> 02:24:55.675
You're looking at 25 to life, pal.

02:25:08.391 --> 02:25:11.019
<i>[woman] State v. Hector Negron.</i>

02:25:11.061 --> 02:25:16.465
Case 14, dockets 79A and 34B.

02:25:16.499 --> 02:25:20.629
Judge Trinkoff presiding. All rise.

02:25:22.606 --> 02:25:27.339
Peter Hammond, District Attorney,
representing People, State of New York.

02:25:27.377 --> 02:25:30.369
Michael Decker, legal aid for defense.

02:25:31.314 --> 02:25:33.339
It's Zana Wilder.

02:25:33.383 --> 02:25:35.681
Michael, let me handle this.

02:25:35.719 --> 02:25:40.088
Legal aid will be withdrawing. Miss
Wilder will be counsel for defense.

02:25:40.123 --> 02:25:41.715
Say nothing, do nothing.

02:25:41.758 --> 02:25:44.318
Your Honor, we ask
that bail be set at two million.

02:25:44.361 --> 02:25:46.795
Defendant murdered a man in cold blood.

02:25:46.830 --> 02:25:50.732
Also, he was in possession of a famous
missing artifact stolen from Italy.

02:25:50.767 --> 02:25:54.328
The old stolen statue head case.
Whatever happened with that?

02:25:54.371 --> 02:25:56.532
The victim is dead, Your Honor.

02:25:56.573 --> 02:26:01.567
Rudolph Tringali, from St. Anna di...
something or other, in Italy.

02:26:01.611 --> 02:26:04.705
Immigrant textile worker,
lived in the Bronx.

02:26:04.748 --> 02:26:06.943
Not him. The statue head.

02:26:06.983 --> 02:26:10.646
[Hammond] Oh, that was returned
to Florence, Italy, Your Honor.

02:26:10.687 --> 02:26:14.817
Proposed bail at two million.
Defense?

02:26:14.858 --> 02:26:16.587
Defendant will post cash bail.

02:26:20.096 --> 02:26:24.965
- Miss Wilder, approach the bench.
- Yes, Your Honor.

02:26:28.605 --> 02:26:33.042
What are you doing here?
Exxon buying the U.S. Postal Service?

02:26:33.076 --> 02:26:37.206
It's a Christmas pro bono case.
Picked it out of a hat.

02:26:37.247 --> 02:26:40.045
My ass. I smell a rat.

02:26:41.251 --> 02:26:42.878
If you expect to get appointed

02:26:42.919 --> 02:26:45.183
to the appellate court next year,

02:26:45.221 --> 02:26:47.781
I suggest you cover your nose.

02:26:53.964 --> 02:26:57.661
Bail set at two million. Next case.

02:27:01.771 --> 02:27:05.434
- Can I ask you a question, miss?
- Anything you wish, Mr. Negron.

02:27:05.475 --> 02:27:08.444
- Who are you?
- A friend of a friend.

02:27:08.478 --> 02:27:11.879
- Jennifer, let's go.
- Right behind you.

02:27:12.983 --> 02:27:14.644
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

02:27:17.053 --> 02:27:20.750
Mr. Negron. Mr. Negron,
who's the Sleeping Man?

02:27:24.194 --> 02:27:26.424
Who is he? Mr. Negron?

02:27:28.765 --> 02:27:30.756
Who's the Sleeping Man?

02:28:04.634 --> 02:28:08.968
- Where are we?
- Rose Island, Nassau, Bahamas.

02:28:09.005 --> 02:28:12.702
- You have a friend who wants to meet.
- No.

02:28:12.742 --> 02:28:16.838
- All my true friends are dead.
- Not this one.

02:28:16.880 --> 02:28:19.542
Your friend has learned
there is no control in life.

02:28:19.582 --> 02:28:22.312
Wherever you go, wherever
you hide, there's risk.

02:28:22.352 --> 02:28:25.446
Your friend understood,
turned knowledge into invention:

02:28:25.488 --> 02:28:31.085
Seat belts, safety devices and so forth.
And your friend made a fortune.

02:28:31.127 --> 02:28:34.619
People pay for control,
even if they have none.

02:28:34.664 --> 02:28:36.859
Safety is the greatest risk of all,

02:28:36.900 --> 02:28:39.596
'cause safety leaves
no room for miracles.

02:28:39.636 --> 02:28:42.901
And miracles are the only
sure thing in life.

02:28:42.939 --> 02:28:47.069
Mister, you talk crazy.
Now, I don't want a miracle.

02:28:47.110 --> 02:28:50.841
I just wanna join my wife,
Lourdes, in the glory of heaven.

02:28:50.880 --> 02:28:52.848
Is that too much to ask for?

02:29:47.237 --> 02:29:49.364
I was the only one left.

02:29:51.207 --> 02:29:53.869
I'm the only one left who knows.

02:29:53.910 --> 02:29:57.107
- I'm the last.
- You're not the last.

02:30:17.300 --> 02:30:19.234
There was a little boy.

02:30:20.803 --> 02:30:23.169
- It is I.
- Angelo?

02:30:23.206 --> 02:30:24.639
Angelo!

02:30:32.949 --> 02:30:34.541
Angelo.

02:30:38.555 --> 02:30:40.386
Angelo.

02:30:45.361 --> 02:30:47.420
Angelo.
