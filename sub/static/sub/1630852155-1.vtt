to make a safe space

04:17.641 --> 04:19.992

30 points for hufflepuff.

13:02.582 --> 13:05.617
So where does that leave our
houses after the first round?

- Well, dame helen,

13:17.397 --> 13:22.400
both teams ran the board,
with gryffindor at 60 points

13:22.452 --> 13:25.403
and hufflepuff also
at 60 points.

13:25.455 --> 13:28.740
- Whoa!
[cheers and applause]

13:28.809 --> 13:30.775
- thank you. I feel I've seen
you before, luke,

13:30.827 --> 13:34.312
and I can't think where it was.
- I don't think so, dame helen.

13:34.381 --> 13:35.997
- Have we not worked together
at some point?

13:36.082 --> 13:37.549
- I'm not sure about that, no.
- Well, I'll think about.

13:37.617 --> 13:39.184
It'll come to me.
We'll see you

13:39.252 --> 13:40.585
at the end of the next round,
luke, yeah?

13:40.654 --> 13:43.287
- Absolutely.
- Great. See you later.

13:43.340 --> 13:45.723
So now it's time for round two.

13:45.792 --> 13:48.126
In this round,
you have to prove

13:48.195 --> 13:50.261
how well
you know your own house.

13:50.330 --> 13:53.097

the questions are now worth
10, 30, and 50 points.

You're going to take turns
aiming each question

14:04.778 --> 14:07.712
at a single opponent
on the other team.

14:07.781 --> 14:10.748
The 50 point question
is the hardest.

14:10.817 --> 14:15.486
So there is some strategy
involved here.

14:15.555 --> 14:18.656
Your houses will be playing
along with each question.

14:18.725 --> 14:21.492
And if their top answer
is the right one,

14:21.545 --> 14:23.394
they'll add more points

gryffindor is worth 10 points.

14:31.538 --> 14:34.205
Hufflepuff, who do you
want to fire it at?

14:34.274 --> 14:36.741
And more importantly, why?

14:36.810 --> 14:41.579
- I think we might wanna give
the first question to trey.

14:41.648 --> 14:46.017
I think he has really
extensive knowledge.

14:46.086 --> 14:47.785
And so we might wanna give him

14:47.854 --> 14:49.721
the question with
the least amount of points.

14:49.789 --> 14:51.322
- Yes.

14:51.391 --> 14:54.459

club question goes to trey.

14:54.527 --> 14:55.827
Are you ready, trey?

14:55.896 --> 14:57.361
- I am ready, helen.

14:57.414 --> 15:01.165
- For 10 points, trey,
gryffindor house was named

15:01.234 --> 15:03.501
after the hogwarts co-founder

15:03.570 --> 15:07.505
who was considered
the best duelist of his time.

15:25.492 --> 15:27.659
- As he is godric gryffindor,

15:27.727 --> 15:32.113
I'm gonna go with,
c, godric's hollow.

15:32.198 --> 15:38.036
- And you are right, trey,
for ten points. Well done.

15:38.104 --> 15:41.089
Let's see
how your housemates did.

15:41.174 --> 15:46.511
They also voted correctly,
so another ten points.

15:46.579 --> 15:50.581
Now, gryffindor,
control swings back to you.

15:50.634 --> 15:54.102
This question about hufflepuff
is worth 10 points.

15:54.187 --> 15:58.189
Gryffindor, who do you want
to answer it, and why?

15:58.258 --> 16:00.425
- We're gonna go with david.
- David.

16:00.493 --> 16:01.893
- I mean,
he's a strong competitor.

16:01.962 --> 16:03.594
- That's true.
- I think I freaked them out

16:03.663 --> 16:05.930
by the way I reasoned
about the roman numerals.

16:05.999 --> 16:08.282
- I think you're right.

16:31.007 --> 16:33.691
- Well, cornish pixies
aren't that dangerous.

16:54.948 --> 16:59.483
A. And they were correct too.
- Whoo!

16:59.536 --> 17:01.652
They earned another ten points.

17:01.721 --> 17:04.038
Now it's your turn again,
hufflepuff.

17:04.124 --> 17:08.226
This question about gryffindor
is worth 30 points.

17:08.294 --> 17:11.996
Hufflepuff, who do you want
to answer it, and why?

17:12.048 --> 17:14.532
- Okay.
Are we feeling any instincts?

17:14.601 --> 17:16.050
- They are--they are
all really smart.

17:16.136 --> 17:17.335
- Yeah.
- I know.

17:17.404 --> 17:19.103
This is gonna be
quite tricky I feel.

17:19.172 --> 17:21.039
- Well, we need a decision.

17:21.107 --> 17:22.507
- I'm feeling brittany.

17:22.575 --> 17:25.393
- We wish to give
the second one to brittany.

17:25.478 --> 17:27.028
- Brittany, tell us.

17:27.113 --> 17:29.514
How did you sort of first
get involved in "harry potter?"

17:29.582 --> 17:31.065
- it wasn't until much later

17:31.151 --> 17:33.618
when I was
in the muggle corporate world

17:33.686 --> 17:35.486
where I was driving
a lot for work.

17:35.555 --> 17:37.855
And so audiobooks
became my best friend.

17:37.924 --> 17:39.907
And then that progressed
into just getting more and more

17:39.993 --> 17:41.459
a lot knowledge
about "harry potter."

17:41.527 --> 17:42.744
- that's very interesting.

17:42.829 --> 17:44.095
You came in it
through audio books.

17:44.164 --> 17:45.530
- Yeah.
- Excellent.

17:45.598 --> 17:46.998
Are you ready, brittany?

17:47.067 --> 17:48.382
- Ready.

17:48.468 --> 17:51.335
- For 30 points here
comes the question.

17:51.404 --> 17:54.538
True gryffindors,
the weasley twins,

17:54.591 --> 17:56.874
showed courage
when they left school

17:56.943 --> 18:00.378
to open
weasleys' wizard wheezes.

18:00.447 --> 18:02.780
In "the half-blood prince"
film...

18:20.133 --> 18:23.067
- I feel like I've heard
fainting fancies,

18:23.119 --> 18:25.536
nosebleed nougats,
and puking pastilles.

18:25.588 --> 18:30.808
So I'm gonna go with c,
bronchitis biscuits.

18:30.877 --> 18:32.777

Well done.

So let's see
how your housemates did.

18:49.696 --> 18:51.696
So who do you want
to make answer it?

18:51.764 --> 18:53.464
- Adriana. She's focused.

18:53.533 --> 18:55.333
I know she's very knowledgeable
about "harry potter."

18:55.401 --> 18:57.401
and I think that we should
give her the medium question.

18:57.453 --> 19:00.771
- Adriana, what brought you
to the world of "harry potter?"

19:00.840 --> 19:03.374
- in 2019,
my mother passed away,

19:03.443 --> 19:05.009
and I felt like I needed

19:05.078 --> 19:07.245
to just throw myself
into something.

19:07.313 --> 19:10.414
From reading it, I thought it
was just a story about magic,

19:10.466 --> 19:12.617
but it was really
a story about love.

19:12.685 --> 19:14.452
And how love is
the greatest magic of all,

19:14.521 --> 19:17.955
and how your mother's love
can help you survive anything.

19:18.024 --> 19:20.958
- Yes, that's very true.
That's where the stories begin.

19:21.027 --> 19:22.643
Absolutely.

19:22.729 --> 19:26.898
All right, adriana.
Noted for its inclusivity,

hufflepuff welcomed

19:31.905 --> 19:34.038

of the phoenix" film.

19:48.888 --> 19:51.489

hufflepuff.

it was her hair color.

the other team gets a chance
to steal for 30 points.

25:05.838 --> 25:07.371
One last thing.

25:07.440 --> 25:11.275
Every game in this round
is inspired by tonight's theme.

25:11.344 --> 25:14.411
And that theme is...

25:17.149 --> 25:19.817
So hufflepuff,
you get to play first.

25:19.886 --> 25:22.353
Which game would you like
to start off with?

25:22.421 --> 25:23.521
- What do you think?

25:23.589 --> 25:24.955
- What do you think, david?

25:25.024 --> 25:26.790
- Revelio.
- Okay.

25:26.859 --> 25:29.326
- Revelio is of course a charm

25:29.395 --> 25:32.396
used to reveal
concealed objects.

25:32.465 --> 25:34.131
In this game,

25:34.200 --> 25:38.035
you're going to try to uncover
what happens next in a classic

- I believe

is he kind of jumps

like to choose?

26:37.813 --> 26:40.314
- Accio.
- I'm cool with that.

26:40.399 --> 26:42.299
- All right, we're
gonna go with accio.

26:42.368 --> 26:47.154
- So accio is the charm used to
summon an object towards you.

26:47.239 --> 26:50.441
For tonight, we've summoned
an actual prop

26:50.509 --> 26:52.776

27:04.056 --> 27:06.390
in "deathly hallows part one"

27:06.458 --> 27:09.626
was the home
of hermione's muggle parents.

27:09.679 --> 27:14.848
One of these sofas was the one
used actually in the scene.

27:14.934 --> 27:16.600
Which one?

27:16.669 --> 27:18.602
- That was not the question
I thought she was gonna ask us.

27:18.671 --> 27:20.154
- Okay.
- But that's okay.

27:20.239 --> 27:21.855
- Guys, feel free to go up
and have a closer look.

27:21.941 --> 27:23.273
- Oh, yes.
- Yeah, okay.

27:23.326 --> 27:25.509
- You know,
have a good old nose around.

27:25.578 --> 27:27.177
- So I'm definitely hearing

27:27.246 --> 27:30.214
"obliviate" playing in
the background right now.

27:30.282 --> 27:32.082
I need to see
the back of the couch.

27:32.151 --> 27:33.584
- Good idea to look
at the back.

27:33.652 --> 27:35.869
- It's the--it was the--
- it was the angle, right?

27:35.955 --> 27:37.388
- I can see the back
of their heads,

27:37.456 --> 27:38.956
the parents' heads.
- Ah, good thinking, trey.

27:39.025 --> 27:40.507
- It was from the back.
- You remember

27:40.593 --> 27:42.726
what the shot was?
- I feel, like, during the shot

27:42.795 --> 27:43.894
you could see more
than their heads.

27:43.963 --> 27:47.164
And this has the lowest back.

27:47.233 --> 27:50.534
- Okay. Right now, I'm really
glad we didn't take accio.

27:50.603 --> 27:55.305
[cheers and applause]

27:55.374 --> 27:58.058
- so you have your answer.
- C.

27:58.144 --> 28:00.477
- All right. Hufflepuff,
what do you think?

28:00.529 --> 28:04.782
Because if you steal it,
you'll earn 30 points.

28:04.850 --> 28:06.283
- What do you think, adriana?

28:06.351 --> 28:08.285
- I think b would probably
be the best choice.

28:08.354 --> 28:12.389
And the fabric does look
a little bit richer.

28:12.458 --> 28:15.209
And we do know that
the grangers were dentists.

28:15.294 --> 28:16.627
- So what is your answer?

28:16.696 --> 28:18.062
- B.

28:18.130 --> 28:20.047

you have gone for c.

Hufflepuff,
you have gone for b.

28:42.188 --> 28:44.955

- That's such
a difficult question,

for a few seconds.

that you can't see.

I stan that choice.

to conjure a blindfold

over someone's eyes,

29:53.359 --> 29:55.793
which makes it the perfect name

where I was.

31:25.017 --> 31:26.733
So which one are you

31:36.412 --> 31:37.861

- Good. Okay.

31:37.930 --> 31:41.164

- Floors. Walls.
Hanging tapestries.

- What places do we have?
- Something in the burrow?

31:56.782 --> 31:58.181

I think 12 grimmauld--

31:58.250 --> 32:00.083
- 12 grimmauld place.
- Where does this fit?

32:00.152 --> 32:04.321

- We're going to go with

32:04.389 --> 32:06.857
number 12 grimmauld place.

32:06.909 --> 32:10.060
- I'm sorry, gryffindor.
You are incorrect there.

32:10.112 --> 32:14.631
Team hufflepuff, get ready to
steal this now for 30 points.

32:14.700 --> 32:19.369

or the ceiling--might be wrong.

32:19.438 --> 32:20.570
Of gringotts bank.

32:20.639 --> 32:22.072
- I thought it was a floor.

32:22.141 --> 32:24.007
I was gonna guess
the ministry of magic.

32:24.076 --> 32:25.375
But all right.
- Let's do this.

32:25.444 --> 32:26.944
- So you have your answer?

32:27.012 --> 32:28.712
- We're gonna go with the floor
of gringotts bank.

32:28.764 --> 32:30.714
Let's see if you're right.

- what is the last word?
Is it...

34:15.454 --> 34:19.539

35:21.019 --> 35:22.269
"the sorcerer's stone."

35:33.365 --> 35:36.533

from somewhere.

35:36.601 --> 35:38.034
Oh, my goodness me.

35:38.103 --> 35:39.986
Well, luke, we'll see you
at the end of the game.

35:40.072 --> 35:42.322
[cheers and applause]

35:42.407 --> 35:45.775
so after the break,
our gryffindors and hufflepuffs

35:45.844 --> 35:48.211
will settle things once
and for all,

35:48.280 --> 35:52.782
to see which team is heading
straight into the grand final.

36:04.346 --> 36:06.246
- welcome back to "harry
potter:

36:06.314 --> 36:08.782
Hogwarts tournament of houses."

36:08.834 --> 36:11.685
there are only 100 points
between our teams,

36:11.753 --> 36:14.221
so it's still
anyone's game to win.

36:14.289 --> 36:15.889
And this final round

36:15.958 --> 36:19.426
is where everything can change
in an instant.

36:19.494 --> 36:22.963
It's called the golden snitch.

36:23.031 --> 36:24.698
[cheers and applause]

36:24.766 --> 36:27.851
in this last part of our game,
you'll have to answer

36:27.936 --> 36:31.104
six increasingly
difficult questions.

36:31.173 --> 36:34.474
As you play,
your houses will play as well.

36:34.543 --> 36:36.560
Each question's
worth 50 points,

36:36.645 --> 36:38.778
but here's where it gets fun.

36:38.847 --> 36:42.315
You know how in the stories
if you catch the golden snitch

36:42.367 --> 36:45.018
it's worth 150 points?

36:45.070 --> 36:46.903
Well, that's nothing.

36:46.989 --> 36:51.157
Because here, my rules
are that if your house

36:51.226 --> 36:53.393
gets all six answers right,

36:53.462 --> 36:56.162
they'll have scored
a golden snitch,

36:56.215 --> 37:01.601
and we'll double those
300 points to 600 points.

37:01.670 --> 37:03.837
[cheers and applause]

37:03.889 --> 37:06.072
if your houses pull that off,

37:06.141 --> 37:10.093
chances are they'll carry
you home to victory.

37:10.178 --> 37:11.578
Here we go.

37:17.319 --> 37:18.685
Is it...

Okay, teams.
Lock in your answers.

Hufflepuff, you also said c.

You've got ten seconds.

In "the order of the phoenix"
film,

40:00.148 --> 40:04.417
dolores umbridge implemented
several educational decrees

40:04.486 --> 40:08.555
at hogwarts, forbidding
a wide range of activities.

Gryffindor, you went for a,

congratulations, hufflepuff.

41:03.211 --> 41:04.911
One more question.

41:06.081 --> 41:09.616
When dumbledor met him
at the orphanage,

41:09.684 --> 41:12.385
tom riddle had a box
in his wardrobe

41:12.454 --> 41:15.655
filled with objects
he stole from other children.

41:15.724 --> 41:19.325

small hands.

of the night.

Well, not quite.

41:55.063 --> 41:58.097
Because we need to know
who's won, don't we?

41:58.166 --> 42:00.850
Luke, before we factor
in our house points,

42:00.936 --> 42:02.635
how do things look from there?

42:02.704 --> 42:08.391

42:08.476 --> 42:10.310

42:10.362 --> 42:13.346

just yet,

42:13.415 --> 42:16.449
because it all comes down
to the houses.

42:16.518 --> 42:18.017
How did the houses score?

42:18.086 --> 42:19.319
- The gryffindor house tonight

42:19.387 --> 42:22.322

impressive performance.

42:37.973 --> 42:40.907
