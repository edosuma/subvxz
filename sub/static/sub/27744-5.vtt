Frankie. Frankie, where are my keys?

00:56.056 --> 00:57.974
Where we hang the oven mitts.

00:58.058 --> 01:00.185
Well, then where are the oven mitts?

01:00.894 --> 01:03.897
Joan-Margaret put them in the freezer
to make arthritis mitts.

01:03.980 --> 01:05.607
She called it a "life hack."

01:05.690 --> 01:09.110
Well, she's really been
hacking my life to pieces these days.

01:09.611 --> 01:12.155
-[sighs] Did she at least get more coffee?
-Oh, hmm.

01:12.238 --> 01:13.948
Um, I don't know. Let me check.

01:15.909 --> 01:16.826
Mm...

01:16.910 --> 01:19.037
No. Listen to this,

01:19.120 --> 01:21.831
next to paper towels,
she's just written no.

01:21.915 --> 01:24.417
-[scoffs]
-A classic J.M. riddle.

01:24.501 --> 01:25.668
What do you think it means?

01:25.752 --> 01:27.420
I think it means
you're doing errands today.

01:27.504 --> 01:31.049
-That's not a fun riddle!
-Okay, how about...

01:32.050 --> 01:36.805
What's swaddled in tie-dye and going
to the grocery store and the pharmacy?

01:36.888 --> 01:38.014
David Crosby.

01:38.098 --> 01:39.516
A cool baby.

01:39.599 --> 01:41.643
My lost <i>Tamagotchi.</i>

01:41.726 --> 01:45.063
Frankie, I'm down to my last three pills,
which means so are you.

01:45.146 --> 01:48.024
Joke's on you,
I have been out of pills for days.

01:48.108 --> 01:51.361
No, you haven't,
because I crushed them up in your cereal.

01:51.444 --> 01:54.572
I thought my blood felt strangely thin.

01:54.656 --> 01:57.575
Look, I've got work.
Somebody has to get this done.

01:57.659 --> 02:00.411
But I just got three seconds
added to a traffic light.

02:00.495 --> 02:02.372
I shouldn't get a list of chores.

02:02.455 --> 02:06.459
I should get a giant key to the city
to open giant doors...

02:06.543 --> 02:08.545
to let in more justice.

02:08.628 --> 02:10.588
We're also out of cookie butter.

02:11.714 --> 02:12.632
On my way.

02:17.303 --> 02:18.304
[Robert] I'm back.

02:19.514 --> 02:21.224
Thought you were taking a walk.

02:21.307 --> 02:22.475
I did.

02:22.559 --> 02:25.436
I walked to the car,
I walked into the donut shop--

02:25.520 --> 02:27.647
What about your diet?
You were doing so great.

02:27.730 --> 02:31.526
Yes, well, that was when I thought
I was playing Don Quixote...

02:31.609 --> 02:33.486
before Peter betrayed me.

02:33.570 --> 02:37.157
Now I'm Sancho,
the plump and jolly sidekick.

02:37.240 --> 02:40.076
These dogs used to be plump and jolly...

02:40.618 --> 02:43.705
before their humans betrayed them.

02:44.414 --> 02:47.917
You know, I agreed to get a dog
because you miss Norman so much.

02:48.001 --> 02:49.252
Why don't you get a Norman?

02:50.086 --> 02:51.045
Wow.

02:51.129 --> 02:52.338
Good idea, right?

02:52.422 --> 02:53.965
No. That "wow" was short for

02:54.048 --> 02:56.551
"I can't believe you'd think
I'm the kind of monster

02:56.634 --> 02:58.386
who would buy a dog from a breeder

02:58.469 --> 03:01.764
when there are
millions of rescues who need homes."

03:02.891 --> 03:05.018
That's what "wow" is short for?
Hmm.

03:05.643 --> 03:07.687
I guess I've been using it wrong
all these years.

03:08.229 --> 03:09.689
Look at Robinson.

03:10.231 --> 03:12.108
He was left in a dumpster.

03:12.734 --> 03:14.819
And Cadillac's owners died.

03:14.903 --> 03:17.405
Who's gonna take a geriatric Pit Bull?

03:18.531 --> 03:21.034
And how about brave little Cissy?

03:21.117 --> 03:23.161
She had half her teeth removed...

03:23.870 --> 03:25.288
but she's still smiling.

03:25.371 --> 03:28.333
Sweetheart, just pick a dog. Any dog.

03:28.416 --> 03:30.585
You can't keep doing this
to yourself or me.

03:30.668 --> 03:33.338
But mainly you. But also me.

03:33.421 --> 03:34.631
You're right.

03:34.714 --> 03:36.090
I'll try to narrow it down.

03:36.174 --> 03:37.383
Thank you.

03:38.384 --> 03:39.719
Oh, God!

03:39.802 --> 03:42.972
Biscuit was just found
in a Costco parking lot.

03:43.056 --> 03:45.767
He was drinking
from a tipped-over can of Fanta!

03:45.850 --> 03:47.018
[Robert groans]

03:58.488 --> 04:00.865
-[spits]
-[man] Excuse me... sir.

04:00.949 --> 04:03.284
-Excuse me, are you Coyote Bergstein?
-Hmm.

04:03.826 --> 04:06.371
The one and only, except for that one
in Toronto that I--

04:06.454 --> 04:07.622
[grunts]

04:07.705 --> 04:09.082
[Coyote gasps] Oh!

04:12.669 --> 04:13.920
Oh.

04:16.214 --> 04:18.341
-[woman] Were there any other questions?
-When they say,

04:18.424 --> 04:21.970
"It could cause murderous thoughts,"
what are the odds?

04:22.053 --> 04:24.389
Can you believe this amateur?

04:24.472 --> 04:29.394
Most people take that list of side effects
and throw it out when they get home.

04:29.477 --> 04:32.397
Ma'am, I need you to honor the privacy
zone in front of the footprints.

04:32.480 --> 04:33.731
Of course. Sorry.

04:33.815 --> 04:35.483
[sighs]
I'm so sorry about that.

04:35.566 --> 04:38.987
So, what are you in for? Lipitor? Fosamax?

04:39.070 --> 04:41.364
-Januvia.
-Warfarin.

04:41.447 --> 04:42.949
Been there, took that.

04:43.032 --> 04:44.659
[Frankie]
So, this is what we do now?

04:44.742 --> 04:49.247
Wait in line to get pills that keep us
well enough to wait in more lines?

04:49.330 --> 04:51.332
Third prescription this week.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.420
You do this three times a week?
How do you stand it?

04:55.503 --> 04:58.006
I don't. I sit it.

05:01.801 --> 05:04.637
Look, I love magic
as much as the next guy,

05:04.721 --> 05:07.056
but I have better things
to do with my time.

05:07.140 --> 05:09.058
Me too. I'm missing my stories.

05:09.142 --> 05:10.852
I could be with my granddaughter.

05:10.935 --> 05:13.938
I don't really have
anything else going on.

05:29.329 --> 05:30.705
[sighs]

05:32.040 --> 05:36.669
Just for the record, I'm ignoring you.
You're not ignoring me.

05:38.296 --> 05:39.380
Interesting choice.

05:39.464 --> 05:42.592
Ignoring me by running over here
and telling me you're ignoring me.

05:42.675 --> 05:44.052
Want to see how I do it?

05:46.637 --> 05:48.139
Thought we were ignoring each other.

05:48.222 --> 05:50.558
Well, you seem really torn up about that.

05:50.641 --> 05:52.226
What the hell is your problem?

05:52.310 --> 05:57.607
My problem is the Penelope Cruz knockoff
I met on her way to your penthouse.

05:58.232 --> 06:00.401
You went to my penthouse? Why?

06:00.485 --> 06:01.444
Because...

06:02.570 --> 06:05.740
Because Frankie thought you
bought the beach house.

06:05.823 --> 06:08.201
And you were coming over
to yell at me for that?

06:08.284 --> 06:09.369
'Cause that's our problem.

06:09.452 --> 06:12.288
You yelling at me for things
people shouldn't get yelled at for.

06:12.372 --> 06:13.790
No. That is not our problem.

06:13.873 --> 06:16.584
Our problem is, how could you
sleep with someone so quickly?

06:16.667 --> 06:18.211
What makes you so sure I slept with her?

06:18.294 --> 06:20.004
Oh... didn't you?

06:20.546 --> 06:22.590
We all mourn in different ways.

06:22.673 --> 06:25.426
-[scoffs] Unbelievable.
-You know what's unbelievable?

06:25.510 --> 06:29.430
For a moment, I actually considered
buying Walden Villas to be with you.

06:29.514 --> 06:31.557
But old people complain too much.

06:31.641 --> 06:33.309
You want quiet tenants and nice profits?

06:33.393 --> 06:35.978
-Buy a minimum security prison near D.C.
-[scoffs]

06:36.562 --> 06:37.980
How can you make jokes?

06:38.481 --> 06:41.526
Do you have any idea
how I felt when I saw that girl?

06:41.609 --> 06:43.611
I mean, we had just broken up.

06:43.694 --> 06:45.655
Let's be clear. "We" didn't break up.

06:45.738 --> 06:49.283
You broke up with me which
you'd been trying to do for months.

06:49.367 --> 06:51.994
-That's not true.
-Yes, it is.

06:52.078 --> 06:55.498
I tried every possible way to show you
how much I wanted to be with you.

06:55.581 --> 06:57.792
That I didn't care
about the age difference.

06:57.875 --> 06:59.502
You're the one who couldn't let it go.

07:00.253 --> 07:03.172
So, congratulations. You did it.

07:05.007 --> 07:06.676
You finally pushed me away.

07:14.142 --> 07:16.436
Come on, I have somewhere to be.

07:16.519 --> 07:18.479
Let the older folks go ahead.

07:19.147 --> 07:22.316
What would Wolverine do
for an older Wolverine?

07:22.400 --> 07:25.611
I have no idea. I abhor tent-pole movies.

07:25.695 --> 07:29.782
You've got young legs,
you can stand longer than us.

07:29.866 --> 07:32.827
I need my Accutane.
I'm not going to NYU a virgin.

07:34.203 --> 07:35.496
Yes, you are.

07:37.206 --> 07:41.627
This is taking forever.
Could you ask them to start another line?

07:41.711 --> 07:43.880
No. I'm a security guard.

07:43.963 --> 07:45.631
But you have any idea what it's like

07:45.715 --> 07:49.343
to stand in one place all day
but not go anywhere?

07:49.886 --> 07:52.013
Yes. I'm a security guard.

07:52.597 --> 07:54.765
[sighs] Oh.

07:56.976 --> 07:58.478
Tut-tut-tut.

07:58.561 --> 08:00.271
It's okay. I was here before.

08:00.354 --> 08:03.191
Yes, but you left, and you didn't
ask anyone to save your place.

08:04.400 --> 08:07.028
You heard me, "Save my place", right?

08:10.531 --> 08:13.075
You're gonna leave NYU a virgin, too.

08:13.951 --> 08:15.620
[Frankie sighs]

08:15.703 --> 08:17.121
Oh.

08:20.917 --> 08:23.878
-That's a beautiful dog.
-Oh, thanks.

08:23.961 --> 08:25.421
He's Harry. I'm Audrey.

08:25.505 --> 08:26.631
Sol.

08:27.298 --> 08:28.925
Harry, say hello to Sol.

08:30.801 --> 08:31.802
Aw.

08:31.886 --> 08:32.803
Which dog is yours?

08:33.387 --> 08:35.097
Uh... Rascal's pretty shy.

08:35.181 --> 08:38.559
He likes to do his business
on the other side of the park.

08:38.643 --> 08:41.062
They're real sticklers
about going off-leash here.

08:41.145 --> 08:42.730
Get him if you don't want a fine.

08:42.813 --> 08:46.067
I would, but I didn't actually
bring Rascal today.

08:46.651 --> 08:47.527
Oh.

08:47.610 --> 08:50.780
Mainly because there isn't a Rascal.
I brought the leash

08:50.863 --> 08:55.368
so I wouldn't look like the weirdo
who comes to a dog park without a dog.

08:55.451 --> 08:57.703
It's less weird
to bring a leash with no dog?

08:58.829 --> 09:00.623
Oh, God. Are you that flasher?

09:00.706 --> 09:03.000
No, no, no. They caught that guy.

09:03.084 --> 09:04.585
Oh, okay.

09:04.669 --> 09:07.797
Truth is, I'm here
for a bit of inspiration.

09:07.880 --> 09:12.301
I really wanna get a dog of my own,
but I just can't seem to pick one.

09:12.385 --> 09:13.302
I get that.

09:13.386 --> 09:16.764
Not the leash,
but getting a pet is a big deal.

09:16.847 --> 09:20.268
But I think you know when you know.
You know?

09:21.143 --> 09:23.145
I wish Robert understood that.

09:23.229 --> 09:25.189
Is Robert another pretend dog?

09:25.273 --> 09:26.399
No, he's a man.

09:26.482 --> 09:27.942
A real man.

09:28.025 --> 09:29.151
My man.

09:29.235 --> 09:30.528
-[Harry barks]
-Oh! [chuckles]

09:30.611 --> 09:31.946
Oh.

09:32.029 --> 09:34.156
This is all I want.

09:34.240 --> 09:37.660
Just a sweet, little snuggler
like you, Harry.

09:37.743 --> 09:40.746
Yes, you are. You are a snuggler.

09:40.830 --> 09:43.457
-I actually do know of a great dog.
-Really?

09:43.541 --> 09:46.836
Yeah, my friend is trying
to find someone to take Harry's brother.

09:47.336 --> 09:50.715
You mean there's another one
just like him?

09:50.798 --> 09:53.426
I hate to admit it,
but Carl's even sweeter.

09:53.926 --> 09:54.885
This is fate.

09:54.969 --> 09:58.764
I'm looking for a dog. I meet you.
I'm not a flasher.

09:58.848 --> 10:01.684
You know a wonderful dog
who needs a home.

10:01.767 --> 10:03.978
It's not that amazing.
We are in a dog park.

10:04.061 --> 10:05.187
-True.
-Yeah. [chuckles]

10:05.271 --> 10:08.691
-So you want to meet him?
-Yes, please.

10:08.774 --> 10:12.278
You will not be sorry,
my friend is the best breeder in town.

10:17.992 --> 10:18.951
[sighs]

10:19.160 --> 10:20.745
Looks like the swelling's down.

10:20.828 --> 10:22.121
[exhales] Thanks, Mal.

10:22.204 --> 10:23.956
Funny they call it a black eye.

10:24.040 --> 10:26.125
-[sighs]
-It's more like a blueish-purple.

10:26.208 --> 10:29.045
-Like a dark magenta?
-That you're trying to figure out?

10:29.128 --> 10:33.132
Not why a polite teen stepped out
of nowhere and punched me in the face?

10:33.215 --> 10:35.009
You sure
he isn't one of your students

10:35.092 --> 10:37.887
who's upset that you gave
the clarinet solo to somebody else?

10:37.970 --> 10:40.723
None of my marching band kids
punch that hard. Except Terry.

10:40.806 --> 10:42.850
But he's Mr. Salt's problem now.

10:42.933 --> 10:45.061
Turns out, when you come back from LA,

10:45.144 --> 10:47.021
you get demoted to middle school band,

10:47.104 --> 10:50.024
and Mr. Salt is the rising star
at the high school.

10:50.107 --> 10:52.860
Okay, let's try to think
through this logically.

10:52.943 --> 10:54.904
-Who would be that mad at you?
-[chuckles]

10:54.987 --> 10:56.322
You've got to be more specific.

10:56.405 --> 10:59.575
I mean, are we talking friends,
neighbors, Brianna?

10:59.659 --> 11:01.327
[chuckles] All right.

11:01.410 --> 11:03.788
Who was the last person who hit you?

11:03.871 --> 11:07.249
Are we talking
closed-fist, slaps, Brianna?

11:07.333 --> 11:09.585
Okay, I think we're getting
off track here.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.879
What could you have done
to make this kid so angry?

11:11.962 --> 11:12.922
I don't know.

11:13.005 --> 11:16.258
You know, I haven't done anything
punch-worthy since I got sober.

11:16.842 --> 11:18.803
What was the most punch-worthy
thing you did

11:18.886 --> 11:20.429
before you got sober?

11:20.513 --> 11:22.264
[sighs]

11:22.348 --> 11:24.975
-Driving on your lawn comes to mind.
-Yeah.

11:25.059 --> 11:27.728
You know, but other than that,
it was mostly just, like,

11:27.812 --> 11:31.565
wham-bamming a bunch of ma'ams
and then not thanking them.

11:31.649 --> 11:32.692
Nice.

11:34.026 --> 11:36.445
Wait, you think this kid
has something to do with that?

11:36.529 --> 11:40.116
-How would he have something to do with--
-Well, how irresponsible were you?

11:43.077 --> 11:44.328
Oh, God.

11:45.579 --> 11:46.497
Wait, you think...

11:46.580 --> 11:49.250
Could he be your son?

11:55.506 --> 11:57.383
[voicemail]
<i>Your call is important to us.</i>

11:57.466 --> 11:59.885
<i>-Someone will be with you shortly.</i>
-Eff you, robot.

12:00.344 --> 12:01.721
Can you believe this bullshit?

12:01.804 --> 12:04.432
I called the pharmacy
to complain about their lines,

12:04.515 --> 12:09.019
and some robot puts me on hold,
as if hold isn't another digital line.

12:10.146 --> 12:11.856
-Uh-huh.
-[sighs]

12:11.939 --> 12:13.607
Grace, are you listening to me?

12:13.691 --> 12:15.234
Uh-huh.

12:16.193 --> 12:18.446
I know why you're distracted.

12:18.529 --> 12:20.740
Because you won't stop talking
about robots?

12:20.823 --> 12:22.491
No. I'm riveting.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.702
You're upset because of Nick.

12:25.578 --> 12:28.622
-He was incredibly rude.
-Not buying it, sister.

12:28.706 --> 12:30.166
-[huffs]
-When people are rude to you,

12:30.249 --> 12:33.419
you banish them
to the studio without <i>queso.</i>

12:33.502 --> 12:34.920
This is something else.

12:35.004 --> 12:37.423
This is hurt with a tinge of regret.

12:37.506 --> 12:39.925
Go to your studio without <i>queso.</i>

12:40.009 --> 12:42.178
Oh, I struck a nerve.

12:42.970 --> 12:46.348
Ah. It's okay to admit you miss him.

12:46.432 --> 12:48.142
I don't miss him.

12:49.185 --> 12:52.062
It was easier not to miss him...
[chuckles] when I didn't see him.

12:52.146 --> 12:53.898
But what does it matter?

12:53.981 --> 12:55.274
I blew it. It's over.

12:55.357 --> 12:56.525
-It's not over.
-[sighs]

12:56.609 --> 13:00.362
It's just the part of the movie
where you have to run through the airport.

13:00.446 --> 13:02.531
I really don't have the knees for that.

13:02.615 --> 13:05.242
I'm talking about doing something big
to win him back.

13:05.326 --> 13:07.453
[scoffs] Even if I could,

13:07.536 --> 13:09.288
I've never pursued a man. I--

13:10.998 --> 13:11.916
I don't know how.

13:11.999 --> 13:14.376
Well, thank Gal Gadot you have me.

13:14.460 --> 13:17.630
Back in the day,
I had to woo Sol pretty hard.

13:17.713 --> 13:19.423
[laughs] Really?

13:19.507 --> 13:22.676
You had to woo a man that wears sandals
made out of truck tires?

13:22.760 --> 13:24.720
Oh, scoff all you want.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.514
He was a Woodstock nine.

13:26.597 --> 13:28.849
Maybe a nine-and-a-half
without the sandals.

13:28.933 --> 13:30.601
Okay, I'll bite.

13:30.684 --> 13:32.436
How did you woo Sol?

13:32.520 --> 13:36.023
I climbed through his window,
covered his apartment floor with flowers.

13:36.106 --> 13:37.483
Yeah. Again, the knee issue.

13:37.983 --> 13:41.612
I placed a classified ad that said,
"Hey, Sol, come and get me."

13:41.695 --> 13:42.905
This isn't helping.

13:42.988 --> 13:45.866
It didn't help Sol, either.
I forgot to put my name and number.

13:45.950 --> 13:48.410
Seriously, Frankie, what am I gonna do?

13:50.454 --> 13:54.291
I don't know, but whatever it is,
you have to put yourself out there.

13:54.959 --> 13:58.295
You might even have to sacrifice
your dignity a little.

13:58.379 --> 14:01.340
But isn't it worth it
if you could get him back?

14:02.842 --> 14:05.094
[man over phone]
<i>Hello, thanks for holding, this is Darren.</i>

14:05.636 --> 14:09.056
Uh... Yes, hello, Darren. It's about time.

14:09.515 --> 14:12.184
You don't know me,
but I'm your worst nightmare.

14:12.268 --> 14:16.397
I just fought City Hall and got
three seconds added to a crosswalk,

14:16.480 --> 14:19.567
and I'm just one
sock puppet soliloquy away

14:19.650 --> 14:22.945
from getting my granddaughter
to laugh for the first time.

14:23.028 --> 14:25.322
<i>So sorry, I'm going to have</i>
<i>to put you on hold again.</i>

14:25.406 --> 14:26.365
No, Darren.

14:26.448 --> 14:28.909
Darren, don't do me like this.

14:28.993 --> 14:32.162
-[music plays over phone]
-[sighs] Don't do me like this!

14:32.246 --> 14:33.455
[groans softly]

14:33.539 --> 14:35.499
[Robert] Who gave you that little goodie?

14:35.583 --> 14:38.252
Who could abandon a face like that?

14:38.335 --> 14:41.130
Let's not bring up abandonment.
It's an issue for him.

14:41.213 --> 14:46.343
You know, I was a little worried about
getting a rescue, but Carl's so loving.

14:46.760 --> 14:48.137
You picked a good one.

14:49.013 --> 14:51.557
I'd say it's more like he picked me.

14:51.640 --> 14:54.018
-Then he picked a good one, too.
-[doorbell rings]

14:54.101 --> 14:56.228
Oh, that's Oliver.

14:56.312 --> 14:58.022
Peter begged me to coach him.

14:58.105 --> 14:59.607
Surprise, surprise!

14:59.690 --> 15:04.028
A 30-year-old doesn't quite have
the gravitas to play Don Quixote.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.657
-You're not Oliver.
-Nope, I'm Bud.

15:08.741 --> 15:12.202
-[Robert] Of course you are.
-Hey, you finally picked a dog!

15:12.620 --> 15:15.205
Yep, this is Carl.

15:15.289 --> 15:16.790
What is he, a Jack Russell?

15:16.874 --> 15:17.833
No.

15:17.917 --> 15:20.419
No, no, no, no. He's a mutt.

15:21.879 --> 15:22.880
[Bud scoffs]

15:22.963 --> 15:23.964
Why'd you name him Carl?

15:24.048 --> 15:28.093
Uh... Oh, because he was found
at a Carl's Jr.

15:28.177 --> 15:30.846
I was found in a Carl's Jr. once.

15:30.930 --> 15:33.182
Sol made me come home and eat carrots.

15:33.265 --> 15:34.183
[chuckles]

15:34.266 --> 15:35.684
You sure this guy's a mutt?

15:36.352 --> 15:39.188
Who can say without a full DNA panel?

15:39.813 --> 15:43.108
But he's a rescue dog
who was found in a dumpster,

15:43.192 --> 15:45.986
so, we absolutely
will never know for sure.

15:46.070 --> 15:48.405
-[Bud scoffs]
-What are you doing here anyway?

15:48.489 --> 15:51.659
Uh, you asked me to stop by
to pick up your old food processor.

15:52.368 --> 15:54.787
Right, for the baby food.

16:00.292 --> 16:03.921
Wow, Carl's already better behaved
than any rescues we ever had.

16:04.004 --> 16:06.256
Mahatma ate the sleeves
off all my sweaters.

16:06.340 --> 16:08.926
-And who's eating all your sleeves now?
-[laughs]

16:09.009 --> 16:12.346
Hilarious from a guy in sweatpants.
Which shelter did you get him from?

16:12.429 --> 16:14.223
Uh...

16:14.306 --> 16:17.893
You know, the one we got
Jerry Garcia from.

16:18.477 --> 16:21.563
Oh... I thought we found Jerr-Bear
at the Strawberry Festival.

16:21.647 --> 16:25.025
Why are we standing around here
talking about strawberry festivals?

16:25.109 --> 16:27.820
I thought you came over
to get a food processor.

16:27.903 --> 16:29.655
-I did.
-Great.

16:29.738 --> 16:32.449
So help me find
the fucking food processor.

16:37.037 --> 16:38.789
-[door opens]
-[clatters]

16:40.082 --> 16:41.208
-That's not it.
-Okay.

16:54.638 --> 16:55.723
Hello, Nick.

16:56.807 --> 16:59.560
You know, when people break up,
they usually see less of each other.

16:59.643 --> 17:03.731
Oh, please, I still see my exes.
Robert and...

17:04.273 --> 17:06.483
-I guess that's it.
-How did you even know I'd be here?

17:06.567 --> 17:08.694
Well, how did you even know I'd be here?

17:09.361 --> 17:12.322
Okay, I'm confused. What are we doing?

17:12.406 --> 17:14.867
'Cause my lunch date's gonna be back
in a minute and...

17:16.243 --> 17:18.037
...this isn't my job anymore.

17:18.120 --> 17:19.997
I just wanna say that you were right.

17:20.080 --> 17:22.249
I did push you away,

17:22.332 --> 17:24.543
but, Nick, I've changed.

17:24.626 --> 17:27.129
-You say that, b--
-No, I mean it.

17:27.212 --> 17:31.425
And I'm better for you than whatever
age-inappropriate sorority girl

17:31.508 --> 17:32.593
you're having lunch with.

17:32.676 --> 17:34.845
Great, 'cause here she is.

17:37.765 --> 17:40.434
[scoffs] You really only have
two types, don't you?

17:40.517 --> 17:43.270
Grace, this is Cathleen.

17:43.353 --> 17:45.230
-My mother.
-No.

17:46.982 --> 17:49.193
So, are you joining us for dessert?

17:49.276 --> 17:50.360
Oh, I don't know, Mom.

17:50.444 --> 17:53.072
Grace, would you be comfortable with that?

17:53.155 --> 17:55.157
Abso-tootin-lutely.

17:57.201 --> 17:58.744
Hmm. [chuckles]

18:05.334 --> 18:06.627
[Coyote grunts]

18:06.710 --> 18:08.170
Jesus fuck.

18:08.253 --> 18:09.463
Wait! Wait! Wait!

18:09.546 --> 18:11.465
I think I might know why you're mad,

18:11.548 --> 18:15.219
but is there anything I can say that'd
convince you not to hit me again?

18:15.719 --> 18:16.845
No.

18:16.929 --> 18:17.805
[moans]

18:17.888 --> 18:21.642
[sighs] All right, I can't do it
with your face all scrunched up like that.

18:21.725 --> 18:23.185
Want me to turn around or--

18:23.268 --> 18:24.686
No! No! Just stop helping me.

18:25.145 --> 18:26.355
[sighs]

18:26.438 --> 18:28.398
[whines]

18:28.482 --> 18:30.526
I can't do it. You're too sad.

18:30.609 --> 18:34.404
Can I ask you...
[stammers] how old you are?

18:34.488 --> 18:36.615
What? I'm 17. Why?

18:36.698 --> 18:41.203
I'm trying to figure out if you could be
who I think you might possibly be.

18:41.662 --> 18:43.539
I'm the guy whose family you broke up.

18:44.164 --> 18:46.083
My dad read the emails
you sent my mom.

18:46.166 --> 18:47.501
What emails?

18:48.168 --> 18:50.170
You had an affair with my mom
and you don't remember?

18:50.254 --> 18:53.549
If it was 17 years ago,
I don't remember much.

18:53.632 --> 18:55.217
No, it was two years ago.

18:56.301 --> 18:57.803
Oh, thank God.

18:58.762 --> 18:59.805
Oh, thank God.

19:01.223 --> 19:04.268
If those emails are
from two years ago, they're not from me.

19:04.351 --> 19:05.769
You need to hit someone else.

19:05.853 --> 19:08.647
No, I know my mom came here to see you.

19:08.730 --> 19:11.400
She told us she'd go
to New York to see<i> Kinky Boots,</i>

19:11.483 --> 19:12.818
but she came here for you.

19:14.903 --> 19:17.156
Wait, is your mom's name Krystle?

19:17.573 --> 19:19.032
So you do remember her?

19:19.116 --> 19:20.075
Yeah.

19:21.368 --> 19:23.203
But it's not what you think.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.290
She's my mom.

19:27.124 --> 19:29.168
-What?
-My birth mom.

19:29.835 --> 19:30.836
And your mom.

19:30.919 --> 19:34.047
She's both... our moms.

19:34.756 --> 19:36.091
But she was my mom first.

19:36.175 --> 19:38.719
And then she gave me up for adoption.

19:39.178 --> 19:40.554
I don't understand.

19:40.637 --> 19:42.598
You're my half-brother.

19:45.726 --> 19:47.102
Jesus fuck.

19:49.271 --> 19:51.481
Yeah.
[panting]

20:01.742 --> 20:03.994
Was Carl found at a Carl's Jr.
or in a dumpster?

20:05.287 --> 20:07.456
It was a dumpster at a Carl's Jr.

20:07.539 --> 20:11.627
But wasn't that other dog
on the rescue site found in a dumpster?

20:11.710 --> 20:15.631
There are plenty of unfortunate
dumpster pups out there, Robert.

20:15.714 --> 20:16.840
Too many.

20:16.924 --> 20:18.508
[doorbell rings]

20:21.053 --> 20:22.221
[panting]

20:23.180 --> 20:24.973
Oliver, so relieved to see you.

20:25.057 --> 20:27.309
-Relieved?
-No reason. [chuckles]

20:27.392 --> 20:30.604
Oh, my! Who is this fancy little pup?

20:30.687 --> 20:32.856
He's not a fancy pup!
He's a garbage pup!

20:32.940 --> 20:36.026
Uh, are you sure?
He looks like he could be a show dog.

20:36.109 --> 20:38.028
Man, he's got great conformation,

20:38.111 --> 20:40.239
and the alignment with his forelegs
to his withers.

20:40.322 --> 20:41.323
How do you know that?

20:41.406 --> 20:44.201
Oh, my mother used to show
German shepherds. [chuckles]

20:44.910 --> 20:45.827
Uh-oh!

20:45.911 --> 20:48.830
And this guy has got perfect form.
Where'd you get him?

20:48.914 --> 20:49.998
From a shelter, right, Dad?

20:50.082 --> 20:52.584
"Adopt, don't shop."
"Buy a dog, kill a dog."

20:52.668 --> 20:54.461
Isn't that what you always told us?

20:54.544 --> 20:56.171
I miss veal.

20:56.255 --> 20:58.465
Well, don't shelters
usually neuter the dogs?

20:58.548 --> 21:01.551
Because this little guy
has still got his balls. [chuckles]

21:02.928 --> 21:05.430
They're prosthetic. For his confidence.

21:05.514 --> 21:07.057
Dad, enough.

21:07.140 --> 21:10.018
Sol, spit it out.

21:10.102 --> 21:12.354
Okay. He's not a rescue.
[pants]

21:12.437 --> 21:13.689
I got him from a breeder!

21:14.314 --> 21:17.609
I looked at his furry little face
and I became a monster!

21:18.694 --> 21:23.991
I'm Sol Bergstein and I paid $3,000
for a purebred show dog.

21:24.908 --> 21:27.286
Wow. And to be clear,

21:27.369 --> 21:30.330
that wow was short for
"Wow, sweetheart.

21:30.414 --> 21:32.541
-You're a huge hypocrite."
-[scoffs]

21:32.624 --> 21:35.210
For that much, I hope he came with papers.
[chuckles]

21:39.715 --> 21:41.842
I get why you hate him.

21:45.012 --> 21:48.890
Senior Fast Pass customer,
passing through.

21:48.974 --> 21:51.226
Senior Fast Pass customer,
passing through.

21:51.310 --> 21:54.313
You go ahead of me.
I don't have one of those passes.

21:54.396 --> 21:57.691
Lucky for you, mine says "plus one".

21:57.774 --> 21:59.067
-Oh.
-[chuckles]

21:59.151 --> 22:01.820
-[Frankie sighs]
-Oh, God, what is it now?

22:01.903 --> 22:04.406
I've just been on the phone
with corporate.

22:04.489 --> 22:07.617
And they are shocked
at your inhuman wait times

22:07.701 --> 22:10.787
and they gave me this Fast Pass card
to make up for it.

22:10.871 --> 22:13.874
So, prescription Bergstein,
Hanson and my new friend...

22:13.957 --> 22:17.294
-Marie Slovatkin.
-Marie Slovatkin.

22:19.379 --> 22:21.590
Security to the pharmacy, please.

22:21.673 --> 22:23.133
I'm not with her, I swear.

22:23.216 --> 22:25.677
Oh, way to fight the power, Marie.

22:26.178 --> 22:27.220
So, we meet again.

22:27.763 --> 22:29.348
We both knew we would.

22:29.431 --> 22:32.601
I'll need you two ladies to step behind
the privacy footprints now.

22:32.684 --> 22:34.561
But I have a Fast Pass.

22:34.644 --> 22:38.732
Looks like an old lady went full-metal
bonkers in the arts and crafts aisle.

22:38.815 --> 22:40.192
You gave me no choice.

22:40.275 --> 22:43.153
Marie and I don't have time
to give up everything in our lives

22:43.236 --> 22:45.238
to get the medicine we need.

22:45.322 --> 22:47.616
You do know they have
mail-order prescriptions, right?

22:47.699 --> 22:51.203
The post office? I'm already
three beefs deep with them.

22:51.286 --> 22:52.662
I am not surprised by that.

22:52.746 --> 22:55.165
Listen you, I could be
with my baby right now.

22:55.707 --> 22:58.835
Not my baby, technically,
but spiritually.

22:58.919 --> 23:00.629
So you go back there

23:00.712 --> 23:04.049
and you get us our goddamn drugs.

23:04.132 --> 23:05.133
[sighs]

23:05.217 --> 23:08.387
If it will finally get rid of you, fine.

23:11.431 --> 23:13.683
You know, this war was never about you.

23:14.184 --> 23:16.144
I just want everyone to be happy.

23:16.228 --> 23:18.939
Okay, I have Slovatkin and Hanson,

23:19.022 --> 23:21.191
but Bergstein, we're out
of both your prescriptions.

23:21.274 --> 23:22.442
You'll have to come back tomorrow.

23:22.567 --> 23:25.612
You have got to be flippin' kidding me.

23:25.987 --> 23:28.365
Don't think we've the kind
of relationship where we kid around.

23:28.448 --> 23:30.784
[cell phone buzzing]

23:33.787 --> 23:36.123
<i>Mom, Faith just laughed</i>
<i>for the first time!</i>

23:36.206 --> 23:38.917
Oh, no! Faith, do it again.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.586
Quick, somebody get me a sock
and two googly eyes.

23:41.670 --> 23:42.879
[trilling lips]

23:43.547 --> 23:45.841
[blubbers]

23:47.092 --> 23:48.844
<i>Okay, she's not doing it.</i>

23:48.927 --> 23:51.263
<i>I'm sorry.</i>
<i>I promise you'll see the next laugh.</i>

23:51.346 --> 23:53.432
But it won't be her first.

23:55.434 --> 23:56.893
[Frankie sighs]

24:00.772 --> 24:02.149
Ah.

24:02.232 --> 24:05.026
Uh, all right, let's see what's better.

24:05.110 --> 24:08.738
To be honest, nothing could be worse
than this carrot cake.

24:08.822 --> 24:11.700
You should leave. This is your nightmare.

24:11.783 --> 24:13.410
Well, why are you saying that?

24:13.493 --> 24:15.078
You told me you hoped
my mom had passed

24:15.162 --> 24:17.289
so you'd never have a moment like this.

24:17.789 --> 24:20.375
Yet here we are, and I'm loving it.

24:21.084 --> 24:23.336
So, how do you two know each other?

24:23.753 --> 24:25.714
Mom, this is Grace.

24:25.797 --> 24:27.841
Remember, I told you?
The woman I was seeing.

24:29.050 --> 24:31.595
[laughs]

24:31.678 --> 24:32.554
Who are you, really?

24:32.637 --> 24:34.806
Well, I'm Grace. I'm Nick's girlfriend.

24:34.890 --> 24:36.057
Ex-girlfriend.

24:36.600 --> 24:39.019
Well, we've had a few hiccups.

24:39.102 --> 24:41.062
More like a fatal, full-body seizure.

24:42.063 --> 24:43.023
[Cathleen] Oh.

24:43.106 --> 24:46.109
So, you two were, um... dating?

24:46.610 --> 24:49.321
I know I'm not exactly
who you were picturing.

24:49.404 --> 24:51.072
Well, no. [chuckles]

24:51.156 --> 24:54.784
When Nicky said he was seeing
someone more mature for once,

24:54.868 --> 24:59.247
I was thinking you were maybe 40,
not 40 times two.

24:59.331 --> 25:01.291
Mom, she's not that old.

25:01.374 --> 25:02.751
Funny story for later...

25:02.834 --> 25:05.128
Mr. Skolka, I hope everything
was to your liking

25:05.212 --> 25:06.796
and that you and your mother...

25:06.880 --> 25:10.967
[stammers] Well, she's the mother.
I mean, clearly she's the mother.

25:12.135 --> 25:14.638
Because you look so much like him,

25:14.721 --> 25:16.598
or he looks so much like you.

25:20.685 --> 25:23.104
So, Cathleen,
what brings you to San Diego?

25:23.188 --> 25:26.858
Oh, just seeing Nicky and my grandson.

25:27.526 --> 25:29.069
Do you have grandkids?

25:29.152 --> 25:32.280
Yes, I do. They're so, so precious.

25:32.364 --> 25:33.657
I never met them.

25:34.491 --> 25:37.202
I don't see them as much as I'd like to.

25:37.285 --> 25:38.870
Oh, they live out of town?

25:40.038 --> 25:41.039
No.

25:41.831 --> 25:43.458
You two do have something in common.

25:43.542 --> 25:45.961
Mom just recently moved
into a retirement community.

25:46.044 --> 25:48.630
Of course, she called and told me
she was moving before she did it.

25:48.713 --> 25:53.468
Well, I'm here to tell you in person that
I've moved out of my retirement community.

25:53.552 --> 25:56.012
Oh, do you have a Richard, too?

25:56.096 --> 25:58.265
Because we kicked our Richard out.

25:58.348 --> 25:59.891
You shouldn't have to move.

25:59.975 --> 26:02.352
Oh, no, it was a big mistake
to move there.

26:02.435 --> 26:03.979
-[inhales] Well, for me.
-Oh.

26:04.062 --> 26:06.690
-It's perfect for some people, but...
-Hmm.

26:07.274 --> 26:09.442
[sighs]
I made a lot of mistakes.

26:09.818 --> 26:11.528
And so we agree.

26:12.028 --> 26:15.031
-On that note, I have a plane to catch.
-But--

26:15.532 --> 26:17.576
Mom, I'll see you when I get back.

26:18.034 --> 26:18.868
Grace...

26:20.579 --> 26:22.038
What was this?

26:22.122 --> 26:23.999
No, wait, don't leave.

26:24.457 --> 26:26.418
Nick, don't go.
[sighing]

26:27.460 --> 26:28.920
Nick, I love you.

26:30.338 --> 26:32.591
I know I've wasted a lot of our time,

26:32.674 --> 26:35.010
but I know what I want to do
with the time we have left.

26:35.093 --> 26:37.387
I want to do you.
[inhales]

26:37.470 --> 26:38.888
[Frankie sighs]

26:38.972 --> 26:40.849
Well, you know what I mean.

26:40.932 --> 26:42.183
I do, yeah. [chuckles]

26:46.521 --> 26:47.772
I'll see you, Grace.

26:49.858 --> 26:51.359
[Cathleen sighs]

26:51.443 --> 26:54.195
You sure know how to crash a lunch.

26:54.279 --> 26:55.614
Oh, thank you.
