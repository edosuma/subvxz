I don't know what kind of game you're running, Vic,

00:18.118 --> 00:19.107

00:19.286 --> 00:21.151

Hello, Helena.

Take me to my babies.

00:33.867 --> 00:35.528
You gave me Kira's stem cells?

Well, when the time is right,

it'll open wide enough to let the baby pass.

Now, for the embryos.

03:07.921 --> 03:09.081
Those are my babies?

That's right. Now, I'm gonna inject
these into your womb.

03:12.592 --> 03:15.322
And then they will implant themselves
in the lining of your womb

03:15.395 --> 03:17.795
and they'll start to grow, just as nature intended.

03:22.235 --> 03:23.224

That's it.

Only until we can buy the time for Duncan to find a cure.

We need to convince Sarah we have
no designs beyond that treatment.

05:23.523 --> 05:25.115

05:25.592 --> 05:26.581
It's not a bribe.

05:27.761 --> 05:28.887
Or a ploy.

05:31.464 --> 05:32.829
You're uniquely qualified.

05:35.969 --> 05:39.200
We could take this program in an entirely new direction.

05:45.512 --> 05:47.639

What about Duncan? Gene therapy?

06:03.330 --> 06:08.063
Even if we pinpoint the genetic cause,
a therapy is months away at best.

her immune system...

But at least we could save Cosima.

But why the Dyad cover story?

07:49.135 --> 07:50.363
Maybe they think he's dead.

Maybe they told him to be dead and go live in Guadalupe,
