00:06.674 --> 00:07.075
.

00:07.108 --> 00:07.708
IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,

00:08.909 --> 00:12.446
SEXUALLY-BASED OFFENSES ARE
CONSIDERED ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:12.480 --> 00:15.249
IN NEW YORK CITY, THE DEDICATED
DETECTIVES WHO INVESTIGATE

00:15.283 --> 00:17.818
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES ARE
MEMBERS OF AN ELITE SQUAD

00:17.851 --> 00:20.221
KNOWN AS
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

00:20.254 --> 00:22.256
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:23.257 --> 00:24.525
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
- YOU'RE AN IDIOT!

00:24.558 --> 00:26.494
- DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
MY CAR COSTS?

00:26.527 --> 00:29.330
- I DON'T CARE HOW MUCH
YOUR CAR COSTS!

00:29.363 --> 00:30.331
- I DO!

00:30.364 --> 00:32.233
[unintelligible arguing]

00:32.266 --> 00:34.235
- GIVE 'EM A MINUTE. BETTER THEY
TAKE IT OUT ON EACH OTHER

00:34.268 --> 00:35.436
THAN ONE OF US!
- YEAH, OKAY,

00:35.469 --> 00:37.305
APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT.

00:37.338 --> 00:38.306
- I KNOW YOU!

00:38.339 --> 00:39.373
YOU'RE ON TV, YOU'RE GONNA PAY!

00:39.407 --> 00:40.374
[arguing over each other]
- LADIES, HEY, ENOUGH!

00:40.408 --> 00:43.344
ENOUGH, HEY, BACK AWAY!
ALL RIGHT, BACK AWAY.

00:43.377 --> 00:44.145
BACK AWAY.
- WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?

00:44.178 --> 00:46.314
- AMARO, YOU TAKE
THE FEISTY ONE.

00:46.347 --> 00:47.315
WHAT HAPPENED HERE, MA'AM?

00:47.348 --> 00:49.250
THAT CRAZY TRICK
RAN INTO MY CAR!

00:49.283 --> 00:51.452
- HA, HA, HA!
- WHAT'S YOUR NAME, MISS?

00:51.485 --> 00:52.653
- REALLY?

00:52.686 --> 00:54.288
DO YOU LIVE UNDER A ROCK?

00:54.322 --> 00:57.225
OKAY, TENSLEY EVANS,
FORMER TEEN MOVIE STAR,

00:57.258 --> 01:00.161
CURRENT FAVORITE
CELEBRITY HOT MESS?

01:00.194 --> 01:01.395
- LICENSE AND REGISTRATION,
PLEASE.

01:01.429 --> 01:02.763
HAVE YOU BEEN DRINKING TONIGHT,
MISS EVANS?

01:02.796 --> 01:05.266
NO, IDIOT, I'M SOBER.

01:05.299 --> 01:06.634
- MY BACK, I NEED HELP...

01:06.667 --> 01:08.436
- AMARO, A LITTLE HELP?

01:08.469 --> 01:10.271
- HEY, DON'T MOVE!

01:10.304 --> 01:11.805
- MY NECK...
- HEY, YOU ALL RIGHT?

01:11.839 --> 01:13.707
YOU KNOW, I'LL CALL A BUS.

01:13.741 --> 01:15.576
YEAH, I'M AT--

01:15.609 --> 01:17.145
HEY!

01:17.178 --> 01:18.479
- YOU GO, I GOT HER.

01:21.882 --> 01:25.619
[siren blaring]

01:38.932 --> 01:40.334
- OUT OF THE CAR, MISS.

01:40.368 --> 01:42.336
- COME GET ME!

01:42.370 --> 01:43.804
- NOW!
C'MON.

01:45.373 --> 01:47.208
- I KNOW I'VE BEEN BAD,

01:47.241 --> 01:48.509
BUT I CAN BE GOOD.

01:48.542 --> 01:50.544
- HANDS ON THE HOOD.
- HOW ABOUT THE SHAFT?

01:50.578 --> 01:51.345
- NOW MISS, PLEASE STAND BACK.

01:51.379 --> 01:52.813
OR I HAVE TO CALL
MY SUPERVISOR.

01:52.846 --> 01:54.582
- CALL HIM, I'LL DO HIM TOO.

01:54.615 --> 01:55.816
I LOVE THREESOMES!

01:55.849 --> 01:57.585
- ALL RIGHT, TURN AROUND, PUT
YOUR HANDS BEHIND YOUR BACK.

01:57.618 --> 02:02.223
- OH! ARE YOU GETTING THE CUFFS
OUT, OFFICER, AH-MEERO?

02:02.256 --> 02:05.159
OH!
[laughs]

02:05.193 --> 02:06.560
- WELL, GUESS WHO'S AT IT AGAIN?

02:06.594 --> 02:08.896
THAT'S RIGHT, TENSLEY EVANS.

02:08.929 --> 02:11.199
FAST, CHEAP AND OUT OF CONTROL.

02:11.232 --> 02:12.833
SHE'S ON HER WAY TO THE
COURTHOUSE THIS MORNING,

02:12.866 --> 02:16.637
AFTER SHE WAS ARRESTED LAST
NIGHT FOR ANOTHER DUI.

02:16.670 --> 02:18.239
- HEY ROLLINS, YOU SEE THIS?

02:18.272 --> 02:20.308
- THIS TIME, SHE'S ACCUSED
OF LEAVING THE SCENE

02:20.341 --> 02:21.575
OF AN ACCIDENT.
- WHAT'S WITH THESE GIRLS?

02:21.609 --> 02:24.378
CHILD STARS AT NINE,
SEXUAL ICONS AT 15,

02:24.412 --> 02:25.879
FLAME-OUTS BY 20.

02:25.913 --> 02:28.449
- YEAH, I KNOW ABOUT THIS.
TENSLEY EVANS,

02:28.482 --> 02:30.351
NICK TOLD ME,
HE CAUGHT THE CASE.

02:30.384 --> 02:31.385
NICK?

02:31.419 --> 02:33.887
THAT GUY'S A DISASTER MAGNET.

02:33.921 --> 02:36.724
I LIKED YOU BETTER
WITH THE 'STACHE.

02:42.596 --> 02:45.566
- YOUR HONOR,
IN ASKING FOR REMAND,

02:45.599 --> 02:48.202
THE PROSECUTION IS WILDLY
OVERREACHING.

02:48.236 --> 02:51.539
ASIDE FROM THIS MINOR INCIDENT,
MISS EVANS HAS COMPLIED

02:51.572 --> 02:54.375
WITH ALL OF THE CONDITIONS
OF HER PROBATION.

02:54.408 --> 02:56.577
- SO, LEAVING HER COURT-ORDERED
REHAB FACILITY,

02:56.610 --> 02:59.280
DRIVING WHILE INTOXICATED AND
FLEEING THE SCENE OF AN ACCIDENT

02:59.313 --> 03:00.814
CONSTITUTES A "MINOR" INCIDENT?

03:00.848 --> 03:03.284
- NO ONE WAS INJURED
IN THE ACCIDENT.

03:03.317 --> 03:05.219
THIS CASE BELONGS
IN TRAFFIC COURT.

03:05.253 --> 03:06.787
IF IT WEREN'T
FOR TENSLEY'S CELEBRITY,

03:06.820 --> 03:08.689
NONE OF US WOULD BE HERE.

03:08.722 --> 03:11.592
CAN WE PLEASE ALLOW MY CLIENT
TO GET BACK TO REHAB,

03:11.625 --> 03:14.328
AND COMPLETE HER PROBATION
IN GOOD STANDING?

03:14.362 --> 03:16.297
NOT SO FAST, COUNSELOR.

03:16.330 --> 03:18.599
THIS IS HER FOURTH APPEARANCE
IN MY COURTROOM.

03:18.632 --> 03:20.534
BUT THERE ARE
EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES!

03:20.568 --> 03:22.636
MARVIN, IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA
TELL HER, I WILL.

03:22.670 --> 03:25.005
WHAT A TREAT IT IS
TO SEE YOU AGAIN, MRS. EVANS.

03:25.038 --> 03:26.807
YOUR HONOR, I APOLOGIZE.

03:26.840 --> 03:30.844
THIS PERTAINS TO MY CLIENT'S
ALLEGED FLEEING FROM THE SCENE.

03:30.878 --> 03:36.284
IT WAS HER PERCEPTION
THAT THE ARRESTING OFFICER...

03:36.317 --> 03:39.787
NICK AMARO,
MAY HAVE BEEN INAPPROPRIATE.

03:39.820 --> 03:41.822
- INAPPROPRIATE?
HE--

03:43.691 --> 03:47.561
HE SAID THAT HE'D LET ME GO IF
I GOT IN THE BACK SEAT WITH HIM,

03:47.595 --> 03:51.365
AND THEN I DROVE OFF, AND--

03:51.399 --> 03:53.434
HE SAID HE WANTED
TO HAVE SEX WITH ME.

03:53.467 --> 03:56.337
[crowd murmuring excitedly]

03:56.370 --> 03:58.005
[gavel hits bench]
- ORDER.

03:58.038 --> 04:01.375
[three gavel hits]
ORDER!

04:02.543 --> 04:05.679
[dramatic music]

04:05.713 --> 04:13.721
*

04:16.724 --> 04:24.732
*

04:27.735 --> 04:35.743
*

04:50.791 --> 04:50.991
.

04:51.024 --> 04:51.759
- MY NIECES ARE
HUGE FANS OF YOURS.

04:52.292 --> 04:53.727
- YOU WANT AN AUTOGRAPH?

04:53.761 --> 04:54.862
[two loud knocks on door]
- HEY...

04:54.895 --> 04:55.896
- YOU NEED A GLASS OF WATER--
- HERE 'S MY STATEMENT.

04:55.929 --> 04:56.897
- BEFORE WE GET STARTED?

04:56.930 --> 04:58.566
- HOW ABOUT A MIMOSA?

04:58.599 --> 05:00.334
- OH, YOU'RE ACTUALLY
INTERVIEWING THIS GIRL?

05:00.368 --> 05:01.835
- IT'S JUST PROTOCOL.

05:01.869 --> 05:03.337
BUT YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

05:03.371 --> 05:05.473
I SAW THE DASH CAM
FOOTAGE, NICK.

05:05.506 --> 05:07.641
YOU HANDLED IT PERFECTLY,
PROFESSIONALLY.

05:07.675 --> 05:10.110
YEAH, SO WHAT? ONE P.P.
WILL JUST USE HER AS AN EXCUSE

05:10.143 --> 05:11.845
TO KEEP THEIR BOOT ON MY NECK.
- NICK...

05:11.879 --> 05:15.649
YOU'RE COMING BACK HERE.
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME.

05:17.451 --> 05:19.753
- MY DAUGHTER DOES NOT DESERVE
TO GO TO PRISON, SHE NEEDS HELP.

05:19.787 --> 05:21.088
- WELL, SHE WAS GETTING HELP.

05:21.121 --> 05:22.055
WHICH DIDN'T ACTUALLY
SEEM TO HELP.

05:22.089 --> 05:24.725
- THESE ARE SERIOUS CHARGES.
DRUNK DRIVING,

05:24.758 --> 05:27.695
FLEEING THE SCENE, FALSELY
ACCUSING A POLICE OFFICER.

05:27.728 --> 05:30.464
WHY DOES EVERYONE AUTOMATICALLY
ASSUME I'M LYING?

05:30.498 --> 05:31.799
- BECAUSE YOU ARE.

05:31.832 --> 05:34.568
YOU EVER HEARD OF
DASH CAM FOOTAGE?

05:34.602 --> 05:35.769
- UM...
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,

05:35.803 --> 05:38.071
MY CLIENT WAS IN
AN AGITATED STATE.

05:38.105 --> 05:40.974
MAYBE SHE MISINTERPRETED
THE OFFICER'S ACTIONS.

05:41.008 --> 05:43.110
- IF TENSLEY SAYS SOMEONE
ASSAULTED HER,

05:43.143 --> 05:45.513
SOMEONE ASSAULTED HER!
- DONNA, DONNA! STOP.

05:45.546 --> 05:47.648
- HEY, MOM, I DON'T FEEL WELL.

05:47.681 --> 05:52.019
- BREATHE, BABY, BREATHE.
BREATHE. REMEMBER...

05:52.052 --> 05:53.721
I NEED SOME WATER
FOR HER XANAX.

05:53.754 --> 05:54.955
PLEASE, SOMEBODY!

05:54.988 --> 05:56.056
- WHY DON'T YOU COME WITH ME,
MRS. EVANS.

05:56.089 --> 05:57.858
I'M SURE WE CAN FIND
A CLEAN GLASS.

05:57.891 --> 05:58.892
- MARVIN!
- WE'LL BE FINE, DONNA.

05:58.926 --> 06:00.394
- I AM NOT JUST HER MOTHER,

06:00.428 --> 06:01.462
I AM HER COURT-APPOINTED--
- MOM. MOM, MOM, MOM,

06:01.495 --> 06:02.863
- GUARDIAN.
MOM, IT'S NOT MY NERVES,

06:02.896 --> 06:04.865
IT'S MY BLOOD SUGAR, OKAY?
I NEED A POWER BAR.

06:04.898 --> 06:07.067
ALL RIGHT.
OKAY, SWEETIE.

06:07.100 --> 06:09.903
ALL RIGHT, I'LL GO.

06:15.008 --> 06:17.511
- TENSLEY...
THE NIGHT OF THE CRASH,

06:17.545 --> 06:21.549
YOU LEFT REHAB
WITHOUT NOTIFYING ANYBODY.

06:22.683 --> 06:25.819
- I HAD TO GET OUT OF THERE.

06:25.853 --> 06:29.890
- BUT PART OF YOUR PROBATION IS
60 DAYS IN REHAB, MANDATORY.

06:29.923 --> 06:32.125
YOU CAN'T JUST DECIDE
TO LEAVE ON YOUR OWN.

06:32.159 --> 06:34.862
- I CAN'T.
I CAN'T GO BACK, PLEASE.

06:34.895 --> 06:36.730
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

06:38.098 --> 06:41.602
- WHAT, TENSLEY?
WHAT DON'T WE UNDERSTAND?

06:41.635 --> 06:42.803
- DOESN'T MATTER.

06:42.836 --> 06:45.706
WHATEVER I SAY,
HE'LL JUST TWIST IT AROUND.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.841
- WHO'S "HE"?

06:47.875 --> 06:50.110
- I CAN'T SAY.
PLEASE, DON'T MAKE ME SAY.

06:50.143 --> 06:55.516
- WE CAN'T HELP YOU
IF YOU DON'T SAY.

06:55.549 --> 06:57.618
- THE PSYCH DIRECTOR.

06:57.651 --> 06:58.852
JIM DURANT.

06:58.886 --> 07:01.789
BUT HE'LL JUST DENY IT.

07:01.822 --> 07:04.157
- DENY WHAT?

07:04.191 --> 07:06.727
- AT FIRST HE WAS REALLY NICE.

07:06.760 --> 07:09.797
HE LISTENED TO ME, AND HE EVEN
LET ME LAY DOWN ON HIS COUCH

07:09.830 --> 07:13.867
IN HIS OFFICE WHENEVER I WAS
OVERWHELMED, BUT...

07:13.901 --> 07:16.036
I SHOULD'VE KNOWN
WHAT HE WANTED.

07:16.069 --> 07:19.072
BY NOW, I SHOULD KNOW
HOW ALL MEN ARE.

07:21.208 --> 07:22.510
- GOT IT.

07:24.277 --> 07:25.879
THAT WAS BARBA.

07:25.913 --> 07:28.882
IN LIGHT OF
TENSLEY'S LATEST ACCUSATION,

07:28.916 --> 07:30.217
THE JUDGE JUST ORDERED
HER RELEASED

07:30.250 --> 07:31.852
INTO HER MOTHER'S CUSTODY.

07:31.885 --> 07:33.721
- REALLY?

07:33.754 --> 07:36.490
SO, SHE RUNS AWAY FROM THE SCENE
OF AN ACCIDENT,

07:36.524 --> 07:39.860
SHE MAKES A FALSE ACCUSATION
AGAINST NICK, AND...

07:39.893 --> 07:42.229
SHE JUST GETS SENT BACK TO HER
MULTI-MILLION DOLLAR PENTHOUSE?

07:42.262 --> 07:44.097
- UNTIL WE FOLLOW UP
ON THE ALLEGATIONS

07:44.131 --> 07:45.899
MADE AGAINST
THE PSYCH DIRECTOR, YES.

07:45.933 --> 07:46.900
- JIM DURANT?

07:46.934 --> 07:49.269
HE'S WELL-RESPECTED.

07:49.302 --> 07:51.872
THERE'S NO RECORD THERE.
NO WHISPERS.

07:51.905 --> 07:54.908
SHE LIED ABOUT NICK.
SHE'S LYING ABOUT THIS GUY.

07:54.942 --> 07:56.810
YEAH, SHE'S JUST GONNA ACCUSE
ANYBODY OF ANYTHING

07:56.844 --> 07:58.078
JUST TO GET OUT OF HERE!

07:58.111 --> 08:02.850
- AMANDA, IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE
TAKING THIS A LITTLE PERSONALLY.

08:02.883 --> 08:04.752
GET A STATEMENT FROM DURANT.

08:04.785 --> 08:06.520
AND TAKE CARISI WITH YOU.

08:06.554 --> 08:08.856
- YEAH, ABOUT THAT.
WHEN DO WE GET NICK BACK?

08:08.889 --> 08:10.257
- I DON'T KNOW.

08:10.290 --> 08:11.925
- HE'S TAKING
HIS ANGER MANAGEMENT

08:11.959 --> 08:13.627
REALLY, REALLY SERIOUSLY.

08:13.661 --> 08:15.863
- AMANDA...
I'M WORKING ON IT.

08:18.599 --> 08:19.833
BY THE WAY...

08:19.867 --> 08:21.869
KEEP SHOWING CARISI THE ROPES.

08:21.902 --> 08:23.203
IT'S REALLY HELPING.

08:23.236 --> 08:24.772
- THAT'S LIKE MY MOTHER,

08:24.805 --> 08:26.574
TELLING ME I'M THE ONLY ONE THAT
CAN MOP THE FLOORS,

08:26.607 --> 08:28.542
BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T
WANT TO DO IT.

08:31.845 --> 08:33.146
- TUCKER?

08:33.180 --> 08:34.748
HEY, YOU GOT A MINUTE?

08:34.782 --> 08:35.916
- NOT REALLY.

08:35.949 --> 08:38.786
- UH, WHERE ARE WE ON AMARO?

08:38.819 --> 08:41.589
- SERIOUSLY?
NOWHERE YET.

08:41.622 --> 08:43.323
HE'S ON PROBATION,
DEMOTED TO TRAFFIC DUTY,

08:43.356 --> 08:47.060
AND A FEMALE CIVILIAN MAKES
ACCUSATIONS OF SEXUAL EXTORTION?

08:47.094 --> 08:48.328
AND YOU WANT TO
CALL YOUR MARKERS IN FOR THIS?

08:48.361 --> 08:50.664
- HAVE YOU EVEN
SEEN THE FOOTAGE?

08:50.698 --> 08:52.800
- LOST CAUSES ARE NOT
MY TOP PRIORITY.

08:52.833 --> 08:56.203
- DO ME A FAVOR AND HUMOR ME.

08:56.236 --> 08:58.806
WATCH THIS.

08:58.839 --> 09:01.842
- I KNOW I'VE BEEN BAD,
BUT I CAN BE GOOD.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.343
- PUT YOUR HANDS ON THE HOOD.
- HOW ABOUT THE SHAFT?

09:03.376 --> 09:04.912
- MISS, PLEASE STEP BACK...

09:04.945 --> 09:06.013
OR I HAVE TO CALL MY SUPERVISOR.

09:06.046 --> 09:08.015
- OH, CALL HIM!
I'LL DO HIM, TOO.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.783
I LOVE THREESOMES.
- TURN AROUND,

09:09.817 --> 09:11.351
HANDS BEHIND YOUR BACK.
- OH!

09:11.384 --> 09:16.289
ARE YOU GETTING THE CUFFS OUT,
OFFICER...AH-MEERO?

09:16.323 --> 09:17.891
OH, YOU ARE...
[laughs]

09:17.925 --> 09:19.660
- YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT.

09:19.693 --> 09:21.161
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO AN ATTORNEY.

09:21.194 --> 09:24.632
- THAT IS BY THE BOOK.
HE IGNORES HER PROVOCATION.

09:24.665 --> 09:26.066
HE'S PERFECT. YOU COULD
USE THIS AS A TEACHING TOOL

09:26.099 --> 09:28.368
AT THE ACADEMY.
- AND YET, WE WON'T.

09:28.401 --> 09:30.771
I WILL DO MY DUE DILIGENCE ON
THIS AND GET BACK TO YOU.

09:30.804 --> 09:33.641
- I'M SHORT-STAFFED.
THE SOONER THE BETTER,

09:33.674 --> 09:34.875
I'D REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

09:34.908 --> 09:36.109
- WHEN THE INVESTIGATION
IS COMPLETE,

09:36.143 --> 09:38.812
YOU'LL BE THE FIRST TO KNOW.

09:38.846 --> 09:40.914
HAVE A GOOD DAY, SERGEANT.

09:40.948 --> 09:42.816
- YOU TOO.

09:46.419 --> 09:48.722
- AS SOON AS WE REALIZED
TENSLEY WAS GONE,

09:48.756 --> 09:49.923
WE NOTIFIED HER MOTHER.

09:49.957 --> 09:51.191
THE STRENGTH, HOPE
AND RECOVERY CENTER

09:51.224 --> 09:52.125
IS NOT A LOCKDOWN FACILITY.

09:52.159 --> 09:54.728
YOU OPERATE ON AN HONOR SYSTEM.
- MM-HMM.

09:54.762 --> 09:58.331
- ALL RIGHT, SO...ANY IDEA WHY
SHE LEFT SO SUDDENLY?

09:58.365 --> 09:59.867
- WELL, WITHOUT VIOLATING
PRIVACY,

09:59.900 --> 10:02.736
SOME PATIENTS CAN
HAVE A HARD TIME ADAPTING.

10:02.770 --> 10:06.774
WE'RE A DRY HOUSE, SO THERE'S
NO ALCOHOL, NO DRUGS, NO SEX.

10:06.807 --> 10:10.043
- AND, UH, THAT INCLUDES
WITH THE PSYCH DIRECTOR?

10:10.077 --> 10:12.680
- IS SHE MAKING ACCUSATIONS?

10:12.713 --> 10:13.881
WELL...

10:13.914 --> 10:15.649
OF COURSE SHE IS.

10:15.683 --> 10:18.251
YOUNG WOMEN WHO'VE BEEN
SEXUALIZED AT AN EARLY AGE

10:18.285 --> 10:19.787
CAN CONFLATE THESE EXPERIENCES

10:19.820 --> 10:21.254
AND THEN PROJECT THEM
ONTO OTHERS.

10:21.288 --> 10:23.691
- HMM. WHAT DID
SHE PROJECT ONTO YOU?

10:23.724 --> 10:25.826
- SHE BEGAN ACTING
PROVOCATIVELY,

10:25.859 --> 10:28.929
ATTEMPTING TO SEDUCE ME, BUT I
VIEWED IT AS A BREAKTHROUGH.

10:28.962 --> 10:31.098
HMM, A BREAKTHROUGH.
TO WHAT?

10:31.131 --> 10:32.866
- TO THE TRANSFERENCE.
WHERE THE GOLD IS.

10:32.900 --> 10:35.736
SEE, THE FACT THAT SHE WAS
BEHAVING THAT WAY,

10:35.769 --> 10:38.438
SHOWED ME THAT THIS WAS
A CORE ISSUE OF HERS.

10:38.471 --> 10:39.940
- BUT NOT YOURS.

10:39.973 --> 10:41.041
- CARISI?

10:42.375 --> 10:43.844
THANK YOU.

10:43.877 --> 10:47.681
SO...DOCTOR, ONCE YOU NOTICED
THE TRANSFERENCE,

10:47.715 --> 10:48.916
DID YOU DISCOURAGE IT?

10:48.949 --> 10:53.086
- LOOK, I BEHAVED PROFESSIONALLY
WITH TENSLEY.

10:53.120 --> 10:54.855
STRENGTH AND HOPE HAVE
SECURITY CAMERAS EVERYWHERE

10:54.888 --> 10:56.123
FOR THIS VERY REASON.

10:56.156 --> 10:57.991
WITH HER PERMISSION,
YOU SCREEN THE FOOTAGE,

10:58.025 --> 10:59.893
AND IT WILL EXONERATE ME.
- AND I HOPE IT WILL.

10:59.927 --> 11:01.695
HOW ABOUT THE OTHER DOCTORS,
MAYBE THE STAFF?

11:01.729 --> 11:03.964
IS THERE A POSSIBILITY THEY
DIDN'T HANDLE HER ACTING OUT

11:03.997 --> 11:05.398
AS PROFESSIONALLY AS YOU DID?

11:05.432 --> 11:08.035
- NO ONE ON STAFF.

11:08.068 --> 11:13.073
BUT SHE DID HAVE AN ENCOUNTER
WITH A BOY, HER ROOMMATE'S SON.

11:14.407 --> 11:16.777
AND TENSLEY ASSURED ME
IT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.

11:16.810 --> 11:19.446
- A BOY?
HOW OLD?

11:21.114 --> 11:22.382
DOCTOR...

11:22.415 --> 11:24.051
- 15.

11:25.485 --> 11:27.721
WE INFORMED THE BOY'S MOTHER.

11:27.755 --> 11:30.891
SHE DIDN'T WANT TO PURSUE.

11:32.860 --> 11:35.829
- CAN YOU SAY "NICK"?

11:35.863 --> 11:38.231
UNCLE NICK.
[laughs]

11:38.265 --> 11:39.232
HEY, COME ON,
GIVE ME A SMILE.

11:39.266 --> 11:41.434
- HEY, HE LIKES YOU.

11:41.468 --> 11:43.136
HE DOESN'T JUST SPIT UP
ON ANYONE.

11:43.170 --> 11:45.305
WELL, ACTUALLY...
LATELY HE DOES.

11:45.338 --> 11:47.941
- OH, HE'S GONNA BE FINE.
AREN'T YOU, NOAH?

11:47.975 --> 11:49.943
- YOU READY FOR YOUR BATH?
- YEAH.

11:49.977 --> 11:51.344
- DON'T FORGET TO DRY HIS HAIR.
- I KNOW.

11:51.378 --> 11:52.345
- CAUSE YOU KNOW, HE'S STILL
BEEN--

11:52.379 --> 11:54.347
- COUGHING, RIGHT.
I KNOW.

11:54.381 --> 11:56.083
- BATH TIME, NOAH.

11:56.116 --> 11:57.484
- TOO MUCH.

11:57.517 --> 11:58.819
YOU KNOW, I SHOULD GET GOING.

11:58.852 --> 12:00.420
I HAVE A HEARING IN THE MORNING,

12:00.453 --> 12:03.924
AT ONE P.P.--
- ACTUALLY, YOU DON'T.

12:03.957 --> 12:06.359
I WENT TO TUCKER, I SHOWED
HIM THE DASH CAM FOOTAGE.

12:06.393 --> 12:08.028
- LIV, I CAN
TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.

12:08.061 --> 12:10.163
- THAT I KNOW.
BUT IT IS A DONE DEAL.

12:10.197 --> 12:13.433
TUCKER, CHIEF OF Ds, THEY ALL
THINK THAT IT'S THEIR IDEA.

12:13.466 --> 12:14.968
SO...GO HOME.

12:15.002 --> 12:18.105
PUT YOUR SUIT ON.
YOU'RE BACK IN.

12:20.507 --> 12:21.508
- SO, THEY DIDN'T BELIEVE
TENSLEY?

12:21.541 --> 12:24.477
- YEAH, TENSLEY HAS
BIGGER PROBLEMS THAN THAT.

12:24.511 --> 12:28.982
A SECURITY CAM FOUND HER
FELLATING A 15-YEAR-OLD BOY

12:29.016 --> 12:31.885
IN A CLOSET AT HER REHAB.

12:31.919 --> 12:33.553
- WOW.
- YEAH. SO...

12:33.586 --> 12:38.258
TALK TO THE BOY, TALK TO
THE FATHER, AND GET THEIR SIDE.

12:38.291 --> 12:40.460
- THANK YOU, OLIVIA.

12:40.493 --> 12:41.795
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

12:41.829 --> 12:43.931
HEY, TAKE CARISI WITH YOU.

12:43.964 --> 12:47.200
- REALLY?
I HEAR HE'S A REAL...EMPATH.

12:47.234 --> 12:48.501
- OH, WHERE'D YOU HEAR THAT?

12:49.970 --> 12:52.806
HMM?
HEY, HE'S EAGER TO LEARN,

12:52.840 --> 12:55.909
AND I THINK WORKING WITH YOU IS
ONLY GOING TO MAKE HIM BETTER.

12:59.913 --> 13:01.915
- I WAS VISITING MOM.

13:01.949 --> 13:03.516
I RAN INTO TENSLEY
ON THE WAY OUT.

13:03.550 --> 13:05.953
I TOLD HER I WAS A BIG FAN.

13:05.986 --> 13:08.856
SHE ASKED ME
IF I HAD ANY WEED, SO...

13:08.889 --> 13:09.789
WE GOT HIGH.

13:09.823 --> 13:12.092
- WEED? WHERE THE HELL DID
YOU GET WEED?

13:12.125 --> 13:14.394
- I UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERN, MR.
MILLER, BUT WE NEED TO HEAR

13:14.427 --> 13:17.330
FROM YOUR SON
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED.

13:17.364 --> 13:19.900
- AND THEN SHE SAID SHE WANTED
TO THANK ME.

13:19.933 --> 13:21.534
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT SHE MEANT,

13:21.568 --> 13:25.906
BUT THEN SHE PULLED ME INTO THE
SUPPLY CLOSET,

13:25.939 --> 13:30.210
WE KISSED,
AND THEN SHE...GAVE ME...

13:30.243 --> 13:31.845
ORAL.

13:31.879 --> 13:32.880
- WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

13:32.913 --> 13:33.713
- SERIOUSLY?

13:33.746 --> 13:35.582
- YOU'RE IN
A LOT OF TROUBLE, SON.

13:35.615 --> 13:37.517
- ACTUALLY, MR. MILLER,
YOUR SON'S NOT IN TROUBLE.

13:37.550 --> 13:39.052
TENSLEY EVANS IS.

13:39.086 --> 13:40.287
- FOR WHAT?

13:40.320 --> 13:41.488
- GREGORY'S UNDERAGE.

13:41.521 --> 13:43.190
THE FACILITY
HAS SECURITY CAMERAS,

13:43.223 --> 13:47.194
THERE'S FOOTAGE OF GREGORY AND
TENSLEY HAVING SEXUAL CONTACT.

13:47.227 --> 13:49.329
HE'S THE VICTIM OF A CRIME.

13:49.362 --> 13:50.563
- NO, I'M NOT.

13:50.597 --> 13:52.399
THIS IS THE MOST EXCITING THING
THAT'S EVER HAPPENED TO ME.

13:52.432 --> 13:54.101
DON'T RUIN IT.

13:56.536 --> 13:57.971
- I WAS JUST TRYING TO BE NICE.

13:58.005 --> 14:00.007
- WHAT YOU DID, TENSLEY,
IS AGAINST THE LAW.

14:00.040 --> 14:01.008
ARE YOU KIDDING?
HE'S GONNA BE THE MOST

14:01.041 --> 14:03.110
POPULAR KID IN HIS CLASS.

14:03.143 --> 14:06.113
- HE'S 15.
YOUR DAUGHTER'S IN HER 20s.

14:06.146 --> 14:09.049
- 15? KIDS AT 15 ARE
HAVING SEX ALL THE TIME.

14:09.082 --> 14:10.650
- WITH THEIR TEACHERS,
WITH THEIR PARENTS' FRIENDS--

14:10.683 --> 14:11.718
- ALL RIGHT!
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S ENOUGH.

14:11.751 --> 14:14.254
- WITH PEOPLE THEY WORK WITH.
- TENSLEY, ENOUGH!

14:14.287 --> 14:17.224
- IT'S NOT LIKE HE WAS FORCED OR
DRUGGED, HE ENJOYED IT.

14:17.257 --> 14:19.592
- OKAY, THAT MAY BE,
BUT THE LAW SAYS THAT THAT BOY

14:19.626 --> 14:23.997
WAS TOO YOUNG TO CONSENT TO
SEXUAL ACTIVITY WITH AN ADULT.

14:24.031 --> 14:25.966
- WELL, THAT CAN'T BE TRUE,
ESPECIALLY FOR A BOY.

14:25.999 --> 14:27.200
- TURN AROUND, PLEASE.
- WHAT?

14:27.234 --> 14:28.468
- YOU HEARD ME, TURN AROUND.
- MOM!

14:28.501 --> 14:29.903
- ARE YOU CUFFING HER?

14:29.937 --> 14:31.338
- MOM, DO SOMETHING!
- I'M CALLING MARVIN!

14:31.371 --> 14:32.672
- YOU CAN'T DO THIS.

14:32.705 --> 14:34.207
- OKAY, WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

14:34.241 --> 14:35.642
YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO PROTECT
THAT COP OF YOURS.

14:35.675 --> 14:37.344
- YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT.

14:37.377 --> 14:38.578
ANYTHING YOU SAY--
- I KNOW MY RIGHTS, OKAY?

14:38.611 --> 14:41.214
THEY'VE BEEN READ TO ME A DOZEN
TIMES IN THE PAST TWO YEARS.

14:41.248 --> 14:43.216
#IPlayedaRookieCop.

14:43.250 --> 14:44.684
- MARVIN, I NEED YOU RIGHT NOW.

14:51.124 --> 14:51.324
.

14:51.358 --> 14:52.392
- MR. EXLEY, YOUR CLIENT
IS BACK IN MY COURTROOM AGAIN

14:52.926 --> 14:54.661
FACING A SERIOUS CHARGE.

14:54.694 --> 14:56.363
SHOULD WE INSTALL
A REVOLVING DOOR?

14:56.396 --> 14:59.032
- SERIOUS?
HE'S BRAGGING ON FACEBOOK.

14:59.066 --> 15:00.533
- NOT NOW, TENSLEY.

15:00.567 --> 15:03.470
YOUR HONOR, MISS EVANS WAS
IN EXTREME EMOTIONAL DURESS.

15:03.503 --> 15:04.972
RATHER THAN PROSECUTION,

15:05.005 --> 15:07.540
SHE NEEDS A FULL
PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION.

15:07.574 --> 15:10.110
- YOUR HONOR, THIS IS
JUST ANOTHER DELAYING TACTIC.

15:10.143 --> 15:12.612
- I WASN'T AWARE YOU WERE
A PSYCHIATRIST, MR. BARBA.

15:12.645 --> 15:16.416
MENTAL ILLNESS IS NOT SOMETHING
THIS COURT TAKES LIGHTLY.

15:16.449 --> 15:19.652
PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION
IS SO ORDERED.

15:19.686 --> 15:20.988
BUT...MISS EVANS,

15:21.021 --> 15:23.390
YOU ARE STILL ON PROBATION.

15:23.423 --> 15:28.495
IF YOU VIOLATE THE LAW AGAIN,
IN ANY WAY, I WILL REMAND YOU.

15:30.130 --> 15:32.165
- I SENT MY EVALUATION TO THE
JUDGE.

15:32.199 --> 15:33.566
TENSLEY'S A COMPLICATED MOSAIC.

15:33.600 --> 15:36.036
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
IS SHE COMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL?

15:36.069 --> 15:39.439
- SHE UNDERSTANDS THE CHARGES.
SHE JUST DISAGREES WITH THE LAW.

15:39.472 --> 15:41.141
- I'D LOVE HER TO SAY THAT
TO THE JUDGE.

15:41.174 --> 15:43.143
THIS GIRL'S HAD ENOUGH
SECOND CHANCES.

15:43.176 --> 15:44.544
SHE'S NOT GOING TO GET AWAY
WITH THIS ONE.

15:44.577 --> 15:46.146
THANK YOU, DOCTOR.
- MM-HMM.

15:48.148 --> 15:49.449
- OLIVIA?

15:49.482 --> 15:50.650
DO YOU HAVE A MINUTE?

15:50.683 --> 15:52.485
- SURE.

15:52.519 --> 15:54.521
SOMETHING BOTHERING YOU?

15:54.554 --> 15:57.457
- I'M BOUND BY CONFIDENTIALITY--
- BUT?

15:57.490 --> 15:59.392
- WE BOTH HAVE BEEN
DOING THIS A LONG TIME.

15:59.426 --> 16:03.530
YOU KNOW HOW SHORT A PATH IT CAN
BE FROM VICTIM TO VICTIMIZER.

16:03.563 --> 16:05.698
IF I HAD A YOUNG SUSPECT WHO
DIDN'T UNDERSTAND

16:05.732 --> 16:09.102
THAT SEX BETWEEN ADULTS AND
TEENAGERS IS WRONG,

16:09.136 --> 16:10.437
OR EVEN ABNORMAL...

16:10.470 --> 16:12.505
- YOU'D WANT TO KNOW WHY.

16:15.408 --> 16:17.577
GOT IT.
THANKS.

16:19.079 --> 16:20.780
- I DON'T GET WHY
I'M IN TROUBLE, OKAY?

16:20.813 --> 16:21.848
LIKE I TOLD THAT SHRINK,

16:21.881 --> 16:25.518
GUYS DID WAY MORE TO ME
THAN I DID TO THAT...GEEK.

16:25.552 --> 16:27.420
- WELL, TENSLEY, THAT'S WHAT WE
WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT,

16:27.454 --> 16:29.489
IS WHAT "GUYS"?
WHEN?

16:29.522 --> 16:30.790
- MY DAUGHTER'S
NEVER BEEN ABUSED,

16:30.823 --> 16:33.093
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE
"INSIMULATING."

16:33.126 --> 16:34.627
- DONNA, IF TENSLEY
HAS INFORMATION

16:34.661 --> 16:37.264
THAT'LL BE OF USE TO SVU
OR THE D.A.,

16:37.297 --> 16:40.267
I WILL INSIST ON QUID PRO QUO.

16:40.300 --> 16:41.501
- YOU SAYING I'M NOT A GOOD
MOTHER?

16:41.534 --> 16:43.236
- NO, MOM, NO ONE
IS SAYING THAT.

16:43.270 --> 16:45.705
WHY ARE YOU HEARING IT?
- WHO DO YOU THINK TOOK HER

16:45.738 --> 16:47.574
TO ALL THOSE AUDITIONS,
ALL THIS TIME?

16:47.607 --> 16:50.543
MADE SURE SHE MET THE RIGHT
PEOPLE, GOT THE RIGHT JOBS?

16:50.577 --> 16:51.544
- MRS. EVANS?

16:51.578 --> 16:53.546
I THINK IT WOULD BE EASIER
TO TALK TO TENSLEY

16:53.580 --> 16:54.514
IF WE WERE ALONE.

16:54.547 --> 16:57.150
- BUT SHE'S MY BABY.
SHE NEEDS ME RIGHT HERE.

16:57.184 --> 16:58.485
- DONNA...

16:58.518 --> 17:00.087
YOU KNOW YOU CAN TRUST ME.

17:01.321 --> 17:02.822
- [clears throat]
- [exasperated sigh]

17:02.855 --> 17:06.259
I'LL BE RIGHT OUTSIDE, BABY.

17:06.293 --> 17:08.261
RIGHT OUTSIDE.

17:12.465 --> 17:14.134
- SO.

17:14.167 --> 17:15.768
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU WANT ME TO SAY.

17:15.802 --> 17:17.470
- LISTEN TO ME, TENSLEY.

17:17.504 --> 17:20.207
THE DETECTIVES ARE SUGGESTING
THAT SOMETHING HAPPENED TO YOU

17:20.240 --> 17:22.575
WHEN YOU WERE A YOUNG TEENAGER.

17:22.609 --> 17:24.244
IS THAT TRUE?

17:29.482 --> 17:32.585
- I WASN'T RAPED, OKAY,
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

17:32.619 --> 17:34.854
I'M NO VICTIM.
IT'S PART OF THE BUSINESS,

17:34.887 --> 17:36.623
I DID WHAT I HAD TO DO.

17:36.656 --> 17:40.527
- FAIR ENOUGH.
SO...WHAT WAS THAT?

17:42.595 --> 17:44.164
- IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

17:44.197 --> 17:47.100
THE FIRST TIME, IT WAS AT
A PRODUCER'S POOL PARTY.

17:47.134 --> 17:49.569
MOM SAID IT WOULD BE
GOOD FOR MY CAREER IF I WENT.

17:49.602 --> 17:50.737
- WHOSE PARTY?

17:53.873 --> 17:55.708
- ADAM BRUBECK.

17:55.742 --> 17:57.177
- AND WHO IS HE?

17:57.210 --> 17:58.311
- HELLO?

17:58.345 --> 18:01.514
HE'S LIKE AN A-LIST
MOVIE PRODUCER.

18:01.548 --> 18:03.416
THIS WAS ONE OF HIS
CASTING PARTIES

18:03.450 --> 18:05.118
AT HIS PLACE IN EAST HAMPTON.

18:05.152 --> 18:08.588
I WAS IN THE HOT TUB,
I GOT TOO DRUNK, WOOZY.

18:08.621 --> 18:11.558
HE TOOK ME INTO HIS BEDROOM,
TOWELED ME OFF,

18:11.591 --> 18:14.661
SAID I HAD A BEAUTIFUL BODY
AND THAT IF I MADE HIM HAPPY,

18:14.694 --> 18:16.896
HE'D FIND A ROLE FOR ME
IN HIS NEXT MOVIE.

18:16.929 --> 18:17.730
SO I DID.

18:19.466 --> 18:21.534
NEXT TIME HE BROUGHT IN
TWO MORE GUYS,

18:21.568 --> 18:24.537
FIRST TO WATCH, BUT THEN
THEY SAID FAIR IS FAIR, SO...

18:24.571 --> 18:26.539
I DID THEM, TOO.

18:30.577 --> 18:32.345
- HOW OLD WERE YOU?

18:33.380 --> 18:35.515
- 13, 14, I DON'T KNOW.

18:35.548 --> 18:37.217
IT WENT ON
FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS.

18:39.186 --> 18:43.156
AND YOU'RE--
YOU'RE 24 NOW, RIGHT? NOT 23?

18:48.361 --> 18:50.797
- SO TENSLEY,
HOW OFTEN DID THIS HAPPEN?

18:52.265 --> 18:53.600
- I DON'T REMEMBER.

18:53.633 --> 18:56.836
I'D DRINK.
OR THEY HAD COKE, ECSTASY.

18:56.869 --> 18:58.705
BLUR THE EDGES.

18:58.738 --> 19:01.641
OPEN YOUR MOUTH, SPREAD YOUR
LEGS, DIFFERENT GUYS.

19:01.674 --> 19:02.509
BUT IT WORKED.

19:02.542 --> 19:04.944
I GOT THAT ROLE
AND I GOT BIGGER ROLES.

19:04.977 --> 19:08.281
MY MOM WAS RIGHT.

19:10.583 --> 19:13.653
- YOUR MOTHER KNEW YOU WERE
HAVING SEX WITH YOUR PRODUCER

19:13.686 --> 19:15.455
AND HIS FRIENDS?

19:16.456 --> 19:17.724
- I MEAN, WE NEVER
TALKED ABOUT IT,

19:17.757 --> 19:20.460
BUT SHE PUT ME ON THE PILL
A COUPLE MONTHS LATER.

19:20.493 --> 19:22.562
YOU DON'T SEE ME COMPLAINING

19:22.595 --> 19:24.464
LIKE THAT PANSY-ASS GREGORY,
OKAY?

19:24.497 --> 19:27.234
I GAVE ADAM WHAT HE WANTED
AND HE GAVE ME WHAT I WANTED.

19:40.780 --> 19:41.180
.

19:41.214 --> 19:42.315
- NOW ADAM BRUBECK WAS THE
BIGGEST TEEN PRODUCER OUT THERE.

19:43.616 --> 19:46.619
SUMMER DAYS, FIVE WAYS TO PLAY
HOOKY, FARCITY BLUES...

19:46.653 --> 19:48.955
- AND ACCORDING TO TENSLEY,
BRUBECK PASSED HER AROUND

19:48.988 --> 19:51.291
LIKE A SEX TOY PARTY FAVOR.

19:51.324 --> 19:52.592
- EXPLAINS WHY SHE'S SUCH
A TRAIN WRECK.

19:52.625 --> 19:54.394
- IF SHE'S TELLING THE TRUTH.

19:54.427 --> 19:55.828
- NICK, I'M GLAD YOU'RE BACK,

19:55.862 --> 19:57.430
BUT REALLY,
YOU SHOULD HAVE HEARD HER.

19:57.464 --> 19:59.266
- WELL, SHE'S AN ACTRESS.

19:59.299 --> 20:00.967
- AMARO'S RIGHT.
SHE COULD BE PLAYING YOU BOTH.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.236
- WE HAD TO PULL IT
OUT OF HER, GUYS.

20:03.270 --> 20:05.004
THIS GIRL DOESN'T EVEN KNOW
THAT SHE'S BEEN VICTIMIZED.

20:05.037 --> 20:06.706
- GREGORY'S FATHER THINKS
THAT HIS SON WAS,

20:06.739 --> 20:09.409
AND THERE'S VIDEO TO BACK UP
THAT CHARGE.

20:09.442 --> 20:10.410
I HAVE TO INDICT HER.

20:10.443 --> 20:11.744
- HOLD ON, YOU DO?

20:11.778 --> 20:12.912
THIS IS TEXTBOOK MITIGATING.

20:12.945 --> 20:14.581
- AND EXLEY IS FREE TO BRING
THAT UP,

20:14.614 --> 20:15.682
WHEN HE TRIES TO CUT A DEAL.

20:15.715 --> 20:17.917
- IN THE MEANTIME, HOW ABOUT
I TAKE A RUN AT BRUBECK?

20:17.950 --> 20:19.952
SEE IF HE WETS HIS PANTS.
- WERE YOU SICK

20:19.986 --> 20:20.820
THE DAY THAT THEY WENT OVER

20:20.853 --> 20:22.589
STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS
AT LAW SCHOOL?

20:22.622 --> 20:24.291
- YEAH, YEAH, SHE'S 24,
WHICH IN NEW YORK

20:24.324 --> 20:25.992
IS ONE YEAR TOO LATE TO CHARGE
STATUTORY RAPE.

20:26.025 --> 20:28.261
ANYBODY WANT TO EXPLAIN TO ME
WHY THAT LAW STILL EXISTS?

20:28.295 --> 20:30.763
- YOU CAN THANK THE CHURCH
LOBBYISTS FOR THAT.

20:30.797 --> 20:32.665
- THE LAW'S THE LAW, ALL RIGHT?
SHE NEEDS TO DO TIME.

20:32.699 --> 20:33.733
- AND BRUBECK DOESN'T?

20:33.766 --> 20:36.803
LOOK, WHATEVER HE DID TO
TENSLEY, DOLLARS TO DONUTS

20:36.836 --> 20:38.338
HE'S STILL DOING IT
TO OTHER GIRLS.

20:38.371 --> 20:39.272
- GREAT, ARE WE GOING ON A
FISHING TRIP?

20:39.306 --> 20:41.574
- BARBA, HOW ABOUT WE
PURSUE TWO TRACKS?

20:41.608 --> 20:43.376
YOU PURSUE YOURS,
WE'LL PURSUE OURS.

20:43.410 --> 20:45.712
NOW, I TRUST THAT THIS BRUBECK
IS STILL PRODUCING?

20:45.745 --> 20:47.414
- OH YEAH, HE'S BEEN BUSY.

20:47.447 --> 20:49.416
LOOK, I'M CHECKING
HIS TWITTER FEED.

20:49.449 --> 20:50.617
HE'S IN NEW YORK THIS WEEKEND.

20:50.650 --> 20:54.887
CASTING EVENT FOR HIS NEW MOVIE
MUSICAL JUNIOR PROM.

20:58.090 --> 21:01.060
[loud boy band music]

21:01.093 --> 21:09.302
*

21:12.071 --> 21:20.279
*

21:23.082 --> 21:28.921
*

21:28.955 --> 21:30.056
- HEY!

21:30.089 --> 21:31.691
NYPD!

21:31.724 --> 21:33.393
YOU GUYS ARE THE BEST!

21:33.426 --> 21:37.330
I DID A DRIVE-AROUND WITH SOME
HOMICIDE DETECTIVES LAST YEAR.

21:37.364 --> 21:38.331
IT WAS SO AWESOME.

21:38.365 --> 21:40.567
- THANKS.
MR. BRUBECK AROUND?

21:40.600 --> 21:42.535
- OH, HE'S IN A CABANA,
BUT HE'S BUSY.

21:42.569 --> 21:43.536
- WHICH WAY?

21:43.570 --> 21:45.338
- UH--

21:45.372 --> 21:46.138
- EXCUSE ME.

21:47.139 --> 21:50.109
- WHOA!
YOU JUST PUSHED BRODY CLARK!

21:50.142 --> 21:51.744
- WHO?

21:51.778 --> 21:53.680
- THE BREAKOUT STAR
OF SUMMER DAZE?

21:53.713 --> 21:54.847
AND THE KNIGHTMASTER TRILOGY?

21:54.881 --> 21:59.051
- I COUNT AT LEAST TWO DOZEN
UNDERAGE GIRLS IN BIKINIS.

21:59.085 --> 22:01.554
YOU KNOW, NO ONE LEAVES.
START CHECKING I.D.s.

22:01.588 --> 22:04.056
ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS GET THAT
SIDE, I'LL TAKE OVER HERE.

22:09.796 --> 22:10.563
- ADAM BRUBECK?

22:10.597 --> 22:13.132
DETECTIVES ROLLINS
AND AMARO, SVU.

22:13.165 --> 22:14.501
- IS THERE A PROBLEM?

22:14.534 --> 22:16.903
- DENNIS GEORGE, HOUSE COUNSEL.

22:16.936 --> 22:18.671
THIS IS A PRIVATE EVENT.
IF IT'S ABOUT THE NOISE--

22:18.705 --> 22:20.072
- EVERYONE HERE HAVE I.D.?

22:20.106 --> 22:21.073
- EVERYTHING'S KOSH.

22:21.107 --> 22:23.443
NO ONE WITHOUT A WRISTBAND GETS
SERVED, SO...

22:23.476 --> 22:25.378
YOU DON'T NEED TO WASTE
YOUR TIME OR KILL THE BUZZ.

22:25.412 --> 22:26.278
- THAT'S NOT WHY WE'RE HERE.

22:26.312 --> 22:27.880
WE WANT TO ASK YOU
ABOUT TENSLEY EVANS.

22:27.914 --> 22:29.148
- WHAT DID SHE DO NOW?

22:29.181 --> 22:31.117
IF SHE'S CLAIMING THAT
SHE HAS A JOB WITH US,

22:31.150 --> 22:35.121
OR IS ATTEMPTING TO USE US AS
A REFERENCE, THE ANSWER IS NO.

22:35.154 --> 22:37.957
SHE'S PUTTANESCA NON GRATA.

22:37.990 --> 22:40.727
- UNFORTUNATELY, WE HAD TO SEVER
ALL TIES WITH HER

22:40.760 --> 22:42.562
A LONG TIME AGO.

22:42.595 --> 22:44.030
- AND WHY IS THAT?

22:44.063 --> 22:45.164
- WHERE TO BEGIN?

22:45.197 --> 22:49.068
SHE ARRIVED DRUNK TO OUR SETS,
CAUSING MASSIVE DELAYS.

22:49.101 --> 22:52.472
SHE WAS INCORRIGIBLE,
AND UNINSURABLE.

22:52.505 --> 22:54.106
- SORRY WE CAN'T HELP YOU.
OR HER.

22:54.140 --> 22:57.143
- BUT DO GRAB SOME SUSHI
ON YOUR WAY OUT.

22:57.176 --> 23:01.648
- ACTUALLY, WE HAVE A FEW MORE
QUESTIONS, YOU MIND?

23:01.681 --> 23:02.882
- IT'S FINE.

23:02.915 --> 23:04.851
TELL THE GUESTS TO RELAX.

23:05.852 --> 23:07.153
CHLOE.

23:12.625 --> 23:14.561
SO, WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?

23:14.594 --> 23:17.096
YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH TENSLEY.
I KNOW SHE'S NON GRATA NOW,

23:17.129 --> 23:18.731
BUT DID SHE USED TO COME
TO YOUR PARTIES?

23:18.765 --> 23:20.867
- SWEETIE, EVERYONE'S BEEN
TO MY PARTIES.

23:20.900 --> 23:23.002
- WELL, HOW ABOUT A POOL PARTY
IN EAST HAMPTON,

23:23.035 --> 23:24.604
10, 11 YEARS AGO?

23:26.539 --> 23:29.141
- I WAS CASTING SUMMER DAZE
BACK THEN.

23:29.175 --> 23:30.677
I'M SURE TENSLEY'S MOTHER

23:30.710 --> 23:32.979
WOULD HAVE PUSHED TO HAVE HER
ON THE GUEST LIST.

23:33.012 --> 23:34.547
- ALL RIGHT, SO SHE WAS THERE.

23:36.182 --> 23:37.784
- WHAT IS SHE CLAIMING NOW?

23:37.817 --> 23:38.885
WITH HER, IT'S ALWAYS SOMEONE
ELSE'S FAULT.

23:38.918 --> 23:40.019
- BACK TO THE PARTY...

23:40.052 --> 23:42.922
IS THERE A CHANCE THAT SHE WAS
USING DRUGS OR ALCOHOL?

23:42.955 --> 23:44.624
- SHE WAS TROUBLED EVEN THEN.

23:44.657 --> 23:47.093
WHO KNOWS WHAT THAT MOTHER
OF HERS FED HER?

23:48.060 --> 23:50.997
- WERE YOU AND TENSLEY
EVER ALONE THAT NIGHT?

23:51.030 --> 23:52.599
- NOT THAT I CAN RECALL.

23:53.600 --> 23:55.134
- EXCUSE ME, DETECTIVES.

23:55.167 --> 23:57.069
ALESSA IS HERE TO SEE YOU, ADAM.

23:57.103 --> 23:59.739
SHE HAS SOME NOTES
ON THE SCRIPT.

23:59.772 --> 24:02.174
- NO REST FOR THE WEARY.

24:02.208 --> 24:04.043
WATCH YOUR BACK WITH TENSLEY.

24:04.076 --> 24:06.112
SHE'S A WASTE CASE.

24:10.683 --> 24:12.051
- I KNOW YOU DON'T TRUST
TENSLEY,

24:12.084 --> 24:14.253
BUT SERIOUSLY, THAT GUY...
- I HEAR YOU,

24:14.286 --> 24:16.188
YOU'RE ASKING ME TO LET IT GO,
I'VE LET IT GO.

24:16.222 --> 24:19.091
- THERE'S NO UNDERAGE DRINKING,
DRUGS, WHO KNOWS...

24:19.125 --> 24:20.527
SORRY, AM I INTERRUPTING?

24:21.528 --> 24:24.230
- NO.
NO, WE WERE JUST LEAVING.

24:24.263 --> 24:27.066
- OH. IT UH...
JUST LOOKED LIKE SOMETHING ELSE.

24:29.068 --> 24:30.570
- SO ADAM BRUBECK'S CASTING
PARTY,

24:30.603 --> 24:31.871
NO DRUGS, NO UNDERAGE DRINKING.

24:31.904 --> 24:33.239
- NAH, IT WAS JUST
A BUNCH OF OLDER MEN

24:33.272 --> 24:35.908
WATCHING WET TEENAGE GIRLS
IN BIKINIS.

24:35.942 --> 24:36.776
- IF BEING A LETCH WERE ILLEGAL,

24:36.809 --> 24:37.777
BEVERLY HILLS WOULD BE IN
LOCKDOWN.

24:37.810 --> 24:40.947
- LOOK, HE SMART, HE'S CAREFUL,
HE'S WISED UP.

24:40.980 --> 24:42.749
WHAT DID HE SAY ABOUT TENSLEY?
- OH, HE ADMITTED

24:42.782 --> 24:45.184
THAT SHE CAME TO HIS PARTIES,
AT 13,

24:45.217 --> 24:46.653
BUT HE BLAMED IT MOSTLY
ON THE MOM.

24:46.686 --> 24:48.154
- YOU THOUGHT HE'D CONFESS
TO CHILD RAPE?

24:48.187 --> 24:50.156
- WE KEEP DIGGING DEEPER,
WE'RE GONNA FIND SOMETHING.

24:50.189 --> 24:51.190
IN FACT, I MADE A FEW CALLS.

24:51.223 --> 24:53.125
- YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
SO DID I.

24:53.159 --> 24:56.596
THIS IS THE RESEARCH ON
BRUBECK'S FORMER CHILD STARS.

24:56.629 --> 24:59.031
OKAY, TENSLEY IS NOT THE ONLY
ONE THAT'S CRASHED AND BURNED.

24:59.065 --> 25:00.266
THIS IS BELLA MACY.

25:00.299 --> 25:03.035
SHE STARRED IN TEENS IN SPACE
AT 12.

25:03.069 --> 25:07.073
SHE DID AN AFTERSCHOOL SPECIAL,
AND THEN DISAPPEARED.

25:07.106 --> 25:10.643
SHE GOT ARRESTED FOUR YEARS AGO
IN OHIO FOR ARMED ROBBERY.

25:10.677 --> 25:13.045
- MM-HMM. GO ON.
- THIS IS JORDANA RUSSO.

25:13.079 --> 25:16.716
SHE STARRED ALONGSIDE TENSLEY
IN SOPHIE SPADE.

25:16.749 --> 25:18.284
SHE'S NOW DOING...

25:18.317 --> 25:20.252
PORN.

25:20.286 --> 25:21.954
NOW THIS IS OUR FRIEND
BRODY CLARK.

25:21.988 --> 25:23.690
- THAT GUY USED TO BE
A COMPLETE MESS.

25:23.723 --> 25:24.991
IN AND OUT OF REHAB FOR YEARS.

25:25.024 --> 25:26.058
- EXACTLY.

25:26.092 --> 25:28.060
THE LIST GOES ON AND ON.

25:28.094 --> 25:31.097
NEXT QUESTION: DID ANY OF THEM
FILE A LAWSUIT, PRESS CHARGES?

25:34.233 --> 25:38.237
- ACTUALLY, HE WAS ALMOST
CHARGED IN L.A.

25:38.270 --> 25:40.640
I HAVE AN EX AT LAPD.

25:40.673 --> 25:42.609
SHE TOLD ME AN ACTRESS NAMED
AMBER FORBES

25:42.642 --> 25:45.144
DROWNED AT ONE OF BRUBECK'S
BEVERLY HILLS POOL PARTIES,

25:45.177 --> 25:46.178
NINE YEARS AGO.

25:46.212 --> 25:47.780
- DROWNED?
HOW OLD WAS SHE?

25:47.814 --> 25:49.081
- SHE WAS 15.

25:49.115 --> 25:50.149
THE M.E. RULED IT AN ACCIDENT,

25:50.182 --> 25:52.885
BUT THERE WAS ALCOHOL
AND ECSTASY IN HER SYSTEM.

25:52.919 --> 25:54.687
BRUBECK AND DENNIS WERE
QUESTIONED BY POLICE.

25:54.721 --> 25:57.023
ALSO, ON THE WITNESS LIST...

25:57.056 --> 25:58.591
BRODY CLARK.

25:58.625 --> 26:01.027
- OKAY, TALK TO BRODY.

26:01.060 --> 26:03.095
FIND OUT WHAT HE KNOWS.

26:05.397 --> 26:08.067
- ADAM TOLD ME YOU GUYS WERE
UP HIS BUTT ABOUT TENSLEY.

26:08.100 --> 26:10.336
IS SHE OKAY?
- HOW WELL DO YOU KNOW HER?

26:10.369 --> 26:12.071
- WE DID A FEW MOVIES TOGETHER.

26:12.104 --> 26:13.940
- AND YOU WERE ENGAGED
FOR TWO YEARS.

26:13.973 --> 26:15.174
- WELL, A LOT OF THAT WAS PR.

26:15.207 --> 26:17.043
BUT I DO CARE ABOUT HER.

26:17.076 --> 26:17.877
I MEAN, WE BROKE IN TOGETHER.

26:17.910 --> 26:20.046
- RIGHT!
RIGHT, ON SUMMER DAZE!

26:20.079 --> 26:21.380
LOVED THAT MOVIE.

26:21.413 --> 26:24.183
HEY, WASN'T THAT GIRL WHO
DROWNED IN IT?

26:24.216 --> 26:25.351
AMBER...
AMBER SOMETHING?

26:25.384 --> 26:27.987
- OH, MAN, AMBER FORBES,
THAT POOR GIRL.

26:28.020 --> 26:29.989
- AND YOU WERE AT THE PARTY
WHEN SHE DROWNED?

26:30.022 --> 26:31.190
- YEAH, IT, UH...

26:31.223 --> 26:32.759
TOTALLY SUCKED, BRO.

26:32.792 --> 26:35.628
- WAS UH...
WAS ADAM BRUBECK THERE?

26:35.662 --> 26:37.697
UH, SURE.
IT WAS HIS HOUSE.

26:37.730 --> 26:40.900
- NOW WAS HE WITH HER,
IN THE POOL?

26:40.933 --> 26:43.936
- I DON'T KNOW, I WAS IN THE
SCREENING ROOM WATCHING VIDEOS.

26:43.970 --> 26:46.072
BUT, DUDE,
THAT HOUSE...

26:46.105 --> 26:49.141
IT'S LIKE, UNBELIEVABLE.
- UNBELIEVABLE, HUH?

26:49.175 --> 26:52.111
- BRODY, DO YOU REMEMBER WHO
ELSE WAS THERE?

26:52.144 --> 26:54.647
UM...TENSLEY.

26:54.681 --> 26:56.916
SHE WAS LIKE A BIG SISTER
TO AMBER.

26:56.949 --> 27:00.787
SHE CRIED FOR, LIKE, MONTHS.

27:00.820 --> 27:02.789
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE.

27:02.822 --> 27:05.091
OH, DID YOU KNOW THAT TENSLEY'S
ALLEGED VICTIM IS TEXTING HER?

27:05.124 --> 27:06.993
I GUESS HE WANTS TO BE
TRAUMATIZED AGAIN.

27:07.026 --> 27:08.260
- THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

27:08.294 --> 27:11.864
TENSLEY'S AWARE YOU'RE HERE TO
TALK ABOUT AMBER FORBES, RIGHT?

27:11.898 --> 27:15.201
- WE UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WERE
AT THE PARTY WHEN SHE DROWNED.

27:15.234 --> 27:17.870
- HOLD ON, DETECTIVE.
THAT DEATH WAS RULED ACCIDENTAL.

27:17.904 --> 27:19.672
EVEN SO, MY CLIENT NEEDS
TO BE IMMUNIZED.

27:19.706 --> 27:22.074
- AND SHE'S NOT A SUSPECT,
YOU HAVE MY WORD.

27:23.910 --> 27:25.244
- OKAY.

27:25.277 --> 27:28.114
- UH, YEAH.
YEAH, I WAS THERE, BUT...

27:28.147 --> 27:30.416
THAT WAS FOREVER AGO
AND I'D REALLY RATHER NOT

27:30.449 --> 27:34.020
GO BACK TO THAT TIME.
I WAS IN A LOT OF PAIN.

27:34.053 --> 27:35.922
- YES, I UNDERSTAND THAT,
BUT WE NEED TO KNOW,

27:35.955 --> 27:39.158
DID YOU SEE AMBER IN THE POOL?

27:39.191 --> 27:42.795
- NO. NO, I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT THIS.

27:42.829 --> 27:43.796
- TENSLEY, YOU OKAY?

27:43.830 --> 27:45.031
- I'M GONNA BE SICK.
- BABY--

27:45.064 --> 27:46.699
- DON'T TOUCH ME!

27:46.733 --> 27:50.069
- ALL RIGHT, THIS AGENDA OF
YOURS IS DESTROYING MY DAUGHTER!

27:50.102 --> 27:51.103
- OUR AGENDA?

27:51.137 --> 27:52.739
YOU PUT HER ON THE PILL AT 13.

27:52.772 --> 27:54.941
- IT WAS HER DOCTOR'S IDEA!

27:54.974 --> 27:56.442
- YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS
GOING ON AT THOSE PARTIES.

27:56.475 --> 27:58.077
- ALL RIGHT, THAT'S ENOUGH,
DETECTIVE.

27:58.110 --> 28:00.046
I LOVE MY DAUGHTER. I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU TWO ARE UP TO,

28:00.079 --> 28:01.781
BUT I WOULD LIKE IT
IF YOU WOULD JUST LEAVE.

28:01.814 --> 28:03.049
- I'D LIKE TO TALK
TO TENSLEY ALONE.

28:03.082 --> 28:05.785
- I'LL GO WITH YOU.
- NO, YOU'RE NOT.

28:05.818 --> 28:07.253
- YOU'RE GONNA STAY RIGHT HERE.

28:09.421 --> 28:11.290
- HEY, TENSLEY.

28:11.323 --> 28:15.161
CAN I TALK TO YOU FOR A SECOND?

28:15.194 --> 28:17.930
TENSLEY?

28:17.964 --> 28:20.099
OKAY, TENSLEY,
I'M COMING IN.

28:22.068 --> 28:25.337
OH, SWEETIE...
WHAT DID YOU DO?

28:25.371 --> 28:26.939
WHAT DID YOU DO?

28:26.973 --> 28:28.207
- [whimpering and crying]
- SHH, IT'S OKAY, SWEETIE.

28:28.240 --> 28:29.809
IT'S OKAY, I'VE GOT YOU.
- NO, YOU DON'T...

28:29.842 --> 28:32.745
I TOLD YOU, I DIDN'T WANT
TO GO BACK TO THAT TIME...

28:40.152 --> 28:40.286
.

28:40.319 --> 28:40.652
- HEY, TENSLEY.

28:42.989 --> 28:45.357
HOW YOU FEELING?

28:45.391 --> 28:47.794
- BETTER.

28:47.827 --> 28:50.029
TODAY IN GROUP, UH...

28:50.062 --> 28:55.001
THIS GIRL SAID THAT MY NEXT
BOTTOM ISN'T ON THIS EARTH.

28:55.034 --> 28:56.869
THAT KIND OF GOT THROUGH TO ME.

28:58.337 --> 29:00.339
- I'M GLAD.

29:03.976 --> 29:06.078
SO THE OTHER DAY...

29:06.112 --> 29:08.981
YOU SAID THAT YOU DIDN'T WANT
TO GO BACK TO THAT TIME.

29:10.582 --> 29:12.551
YOU THINK YOU'RE READY NOW?

29:12.584 --> 29:13.786
- UM...

29:17.957 --> 29:21.027
IT'S ALL I THINK ABOUT.

29:21.060 --> 29:25.798
EVERYBODY IN GROUP KNOWS, SO...

29:25.832 --> 29:27.834
YOU MIGHT AS WELL, TOO.

29:34.540 --> 29:36.943
- SO...

29:36.976 --> 29:38.978
THAT NIGHT IN THE POOL.

29:43.850 --> 29:48.254
- UM, IT WAS...

29:48.287 --> 29:51.958
IT WAS AMBER, ADAM AND I.

29:51.991 --> 29:53.926
WE WERE HIGH.

29:53.960 --> 29:55.527
ON, UH--ON KIX.
IT'S--

29:55.561 --> 29:58.064
- KETAMINE.
ECSTASY.

30:00.599 --> 30:02.801
- IT WORKS.

30:05.071 --> 30:06.873
WE WERE SPLASHING AROUND
AND THEN ADAM

30:06.906 --> 30:09.976
SET DOWN THE HOUSE RULES.

30:10.009 --> 30:12.011
- WHICH WERE?

30:14.246 --> 30:15.982
- HE WANTED US
TO TAKE TURNS ON HIM

30:16.015 --> 30:19.018
WHILE HE HELD OUR HEADS
UNDERWATER.

30:23.990 --> 30:26.058
AMBER WAS SO SCARED.

30:27.927 --> 30:29.395
BUT I'D DONE IT BEFORE,
SO I WENT FOR IT,

30:29.428 --> 30:31.097
AND I CHOKED, AND...

30:31.130 --> 30:33.065
I HAD TO GO INSIDE.

30:33.099 --> 30:35.367
AND I TRIED, I TRIED TO GET
AMBER TO COME WITH ME,

30:35.401 --> 30:37.403
BUT ADAM SAID NO, AND...

30:41.240 --> 30:44.944
I NEVER SHOULD HAVE LEFT HER.

30:44.977 --> 30:47.980
SHE WAS 15 AND SHE WAS STILL NEW
TO THIS, AND--

30:51.117 --> 30:54.120
IT'S MY FAULT SHE DROWNED.

31:04.096 --> 31:05.031
- I HEARD ABOUT TENSLEY.

31:05.064 --> 31:06.999
I SENT HER FLOWERS.
IS SHE GONNA BE OKAY?

31:07.033 --> 31:09.068
- WELL, SHE'S DEALING WITH
A LOT OF GUILT ABOUT AMBER,

31:09.101 --> 31:10.669
AND SHE COULD USE MORE THAN
FLOWERS FROM YOU.

31:10.702 --> 31:12.271
- LOOK, I-I ALREADY
TOLD YOU GUYS.

31:12.304 --> 31:13.539
I DID NOT SEE WHAT HAPPENED.

31:13.572 --> 31:15.041
- WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

31:15.074 --> 31:16.508
TENSLEY TOLD US ABOUT
ADAM'S WATER GAMES,

31:16.542 --> 31:18.210
AND SHE SAID THAT
YOU KNEW ABOUT 'EM, TOO.

31:18.244 --> 31:19.211
- HEY, DID HE PAY YOU?

31:19.245 --> 31:21.413
GIVE YOU MORE ACTING JOBS?

31:21.447 --> 31:24.083
IS THAT WHY YOU PROTECTED
ADAM'S SECRET?

31:24.116 --> 31:28.020
- IT WASN'T ADAM'S SECRET.

31:28.054 --> 31:30.189
IT WAS--
IT WAS MINE.

31:32.124 --> 31:37.329
I WAS IN THE SCREENING ROOM
THAT NIGHT WITH A MAN,

31:37.363 --> 31:39.365
AND WE WEREN'T WATCHING MOVIES.

31:42.234 --> 31:43.635
- SO YOU HELPED
COVER UP A MURDER,

31:43.669 --> 31:45.637
BECAUSE YOU WERE AFRAID
OF GETTING OUTED?

31:45.671 --> 31:47.706
- I'M STILL AFRAID.

31:47.739 --> 31:51.310
I DON'T CARE HOW MUCH
THINGS HAVE CHANGED.

31:51.343 --> 31:53.279
IF I COME OUT,
MY CAREER IS OVER.

31:53.312 --> 31:55.481
- AMBER'S DEAD, ALL RIGHT?
TENSLEY TRIED TO KILL HERSELF,

31:55.514 --> 31:57.583
AND YOUR CAREER IS
THE ONLY THING YOU CARE ABOUT?

31:57.616 --> 31:59.085
- NO! I--
- SO...

31:59.118 --> 32:01.253
THIS MAN
YOU WERE WITH THAT NIGHT.

32:01.287 --> 32:03.956
YOU THINK HE MIGHT TESTIFY
TO WHAT HE SAW OR HEARD?

32:03.990 --> 32:06.058
- NOT A CHANCE.

32:06.092 --> 32:07.693
HE'S IN THE CLOSET, TOO.
HE'S THE ONE WHO THREATENED

32:07.726 --> 32:09.928
TO DESTROY ME
IF I EVER SAID A WORD.

32:15.434 --> 32:17.103
- IT WAS A TRAGEDY.

32:17.136 --> 32:19.972
LAPD INVESTIGATED,
RULED IT ACCIDENTAL.

32:20.006 --> 32:22.108
- AH, BUT YOU WERE THERE,
CORRECT.

32:22.141 --> 32:23.142
- YES.

32:25.011 --> 32:27.513
I WAS IN THE STUDY
ON A BUSINESS CALL.

32:27.546 --> 32:31.217
I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING, I TOLD
THE POLICE THAT AT THE TIME.

32:31.250 --> 32:33.252
- YOU'RE A LAWYER, SO YOU KNOW
LYING TO THE POLICE AND THE D.A.

32:33.285 --> 32:35.988
IS AN OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE.
I'M GONNA ASK YOU AGAIN.

32:36.022 --> 32:40.059
YOU WERE ALONE IN THE STUDY
MAKING A CALL?

32:40.092 --> 32:43.595
- WHAT'S THIS REALLY ABOUT?
- BRODY CLARK.

32:43.629 --> 32:45.664
YOU REMEMBER SEEING HIM?

32:45.697 --> 32:47.599
- [scoffs]
THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE

32:47.633 --> 32:51.303
AT THAT PARTY.
I HAVE A VAGUE RECOLLECTION.

32:51.337 --> 32:53.339
- BRODY'S ISN'T QUITE AS VAGUE.

32:56.108 --> 32:58.677
- HE WAS OF AGE.

32:58.710 --> 33:02.714
I DO HOPE THE NYPD ISN'T IN
THE BUSINESS OF OUTING GAY MEN.

33:05.151 --> 33:07.153
- WELL, WE CERTAINLY
DON'T HAVE TO BE.

33:10.189 --> 33:12.724
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?

33:12.758 --> 33:14.793
- CAN YOU TURN AROUND
FOR ME, HONEY?

33:14.826 --> 33:16.162
SLOWER.
THAT'S IT.

33:16.195 --> 33:21.067
YEAH.
NICE LONG LEGS.

33:21.100 --> 33:23.435
YOU'RE NOT A PRUDE,
ARE YOU?

33:23.469 --> 33:28.340
YOU LOOK FLEXIBLE,
CAN YOU DO A SPLIT?

33:28.374 --> 33:29.341
NOW BOUNCE UP AND DOWN A LITTLE.

33:29.375 --> 33:30.576
OH, YEAH.
JUST LIKE THAT.

33:30.609 --> 33:32.111
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT I LIKE.

33:32.144 --> 33:35.414
NOW MAKE ME BELIEVE
YOU'RE A PUSSY CAT.

33:35.447 --> 33:37.083
YEAH! YEAH, THAT'S IT.

33:37.116 --> 33:39.085
NOW ARCH YOUR BACK.

33:39.118 --> 33:40.286
OH, COME ON,
LOOSEN UP.

33:40.319 --> 33:42.421
SHOW ME YOU'RE NOT ASHAMED
OF YOUR BODY.

33:42.454 --> 33:43.722
OH, I CAN WORK WITH THAT.

33:43.755 --> 33:47.659
OH HO HO,
I THINK I JUST GOT VERY LUCKY.

33:47.693 --> 33:49.628
- LOOK, DENNIS GAVE US
TWO MORE FLASH DRIVES,

33:49.661 --> 33:51.763
WE'VE GONE THROUGH HOURS
OF THIS STUFF.

33:51.797 --> 33:53.599
- IS THERE ANYONE UNDERAGE
IN THESE VIDEOS

33:53.632 --> 33:56.535
WHO'S WITHIN
THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS?

33:56.568 --> 33:58.270
- HE'S MORE CLEVER THAN THAT.

33:58.304 --> 34:01.073
IN THE LAST NINE YEARS,
ALL OF BRUBECK'S MOVIES

34:01.107 --> 34:03.742
HAVE BEEN SHOT IN PENNSYLVANIA,
WASHINGTON OR MONTANA.

34:03.775 --> 34:06.378
- ALL STATES WITH AN AGE OF
CONSENT OF 16,

34:06.412 --> 34:08.247
AND A MISTAKE OF AGE DEFENSE.

34:08.280 --> 34:10.849
- MEANING, THE GUY CAN HAVE SEX
WITH A 14-YEAR-OLD,

34:10.882 --> 34:13.385
AND CLAIM HE THOUGHT
THAT SHE WAS 16.

34:13.419 --> 34:14.820
HE'S TOO SMART.

34:14.853 --> 34:19.425
HE'S BEEN GAMING THE SYSTEM
EVER SINCE AMBER DIED.

34:19.458 --> 34:20.759
- ALL RIGHT, SO THAT'S IT.
WE JUST GIVE UP?

34:20.792 --> 34:22.594
- OH, WE'RE NOT GIVING UP.

34:22.628 --> 34:26.132
THIS GUY KILLED AMBER FORBES.
HE HAS RUINED COUNTLESS LIVES.

34:26.165 --> 34:28.334
THERE HAS GOT TO BE A WAY
TO STOP HIM.

34:28.367 --> 34:29.835
- AND YET,

34:29.868 --> 34:33.139
BRUBECK'S THREADING THE LOOPHOLE
OF LEGALITIES STATE BY STATE.

34:33.172 --> 34:34.440
HE KEEPS VERY GOOD RECORDS,
VERY THOROUGH.

34:34.473 --> 34:37.476
HE'S GOT THEIR D.O.B.
ON EVERY AUDITION VIDEO.

34:37.509 --> 34:40.346
PENNSYLVANIA...PENNSYLVANIA...

34:40.379 --> 34:42.381
MONTANA...

34:45.217 --> 34:49.155
WHAT IS THIS?
WINNIPEG NIGHTS?

34:49.188 --> 34:50.756
WHO SAW THIS TAPE?
- I DID.

34:50.789 --> 34:54.593
BUT IT'S NOT LIKE AN AUDITION.
IT'S MORE LIKE FOREPLAY.

34:54.626 --> 34:55.694
- WAS IT SHOT IN CANADA?

34:55.727 --> 34:58.797
- THE AUDITION WAS,
BUT THE MOVIE WAS NEVER MADE.

35:01.933 --> 35:04.336
- HOLD ON.
DID HE AUDITION ANYBODY ELSE?

35:04.370 --> 35:06.905
- NO, NO, THAT'S JUST
THE ONE GIRL, MAUDE PETERSON.

35:06.938 --> 35:09.775
BUT SHE WAS 16.

35:09.808 --> 35:13.179
- OKAY, I NEED YOU TWO
TO GET ON A PLANE TO WINNIPEG.

35:13.212 --> 35:14.313
- NOW?
- RIGHT NOW. I NEED YOU

35:14.346 --> 35:18.150
TO TALK TO MAUDE, FIND OUT HOW
SHE GOT THIS AUDITION,

35:18.184 --> 35:20.419
IF THERE WAS EVER A SCRIPT
AT ALL, AND...

35:20.452 --> 35:21.820
HOW FAR HE GOT WITH HER.

35:21.853 --> 35:22.621
- HOW DOES THAT MATTER?

35:22.654 --> 35:23.889
THE AGE OF CONSENT
IN CANADA IS 16.

35:23.922 --> 35:26.858
- IF THE FILM WAS NEVER MADE,
AND IF HE GOT LUCKY UP THERE,

35:36.402 --> 35:36.602
.

35:36.635 --> 35:37.636
- YEAH, WE WANT TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT ADAM BRUBECK.

35:38.604 --> 35:41.273
- ADAM BRUBECK?
HAVEN'T TALKED TO HIM IN YEARS.

35:41.307 --> 35:42.741
- SINCE YOU AUDITIONED FOR HIM.

35:42.774 --> 35:44.876
- THAT'S RIGHT.
WHY?

35:44.910 --> 35:47.813
- WELL, MAUDE,
HOW DID YOU GET THE AUDITION?

35:47.846 --> 35:49.748
- IT'S A WEIRD STORY.

35:49.781 --> 35:51.250
I LOVED HIS MOVIES.

35:51.283 --> 35:54.653
I TWEETED A VINE TO HIM
IN NEW YORK.

35:54.686 --> 35:55.787
HE CALLED ME THE NEXT DAY.

35:55.821 --> 35:58.724
WE EMAILED AND VIDEO CHATTED.

35:58.757 --> 36:00.826
HE SAID IT WAS AMAZING TIMING,
BECAUSE HE HAD JUST GOTTEN

36:00.859 --> 36:02.728
A SCRIPT FOR A MOVIE SET
IN CANADA.

36:02.761 --> 36:04.330
- WINNIPEG NIGHTS.

36:04.363 --> 36:06.932
- HE SAID I'D BE PERFECT FOR
THE LEAD, MALLORY.

36:06.965 --> 36:08.967
A GYMNAST WHO GETS CANCER.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.237
- SO HE SENT YOU A SCRIPT?

36:11.270 --> 36:12.070
- NO.

36:12.103 --> 36:14.273
HE SAID I SHOULD WORK ON
A MONOLOGUE,

36:14.306 --> 36:16.708
AND THEN WE WOULD IMPROVISE.

36:16.742 --> 36:19.311
- RIGHT, AND THEN HE FLEW
UP HERE, TO WINNIPEG?

36:22.914 --> 36:25.817
AND WHERE'D HE HOLD
THE AUDITION?

36:27.686 --> 36:29.855
- IN HIS HOTEL SUITE.

36:29.888 --> 36:32.824
HE SAID THERE WASN'T
AN OFFICIAL OFFICE SET UP YET.

36:32.858 --> 36:35.227
IT WAS REALLY EARLY
IN PRE-PRODUCTION.

36:36.027 --> 36:37.796
- DID HE HAVE ANYONE WITH HIM?

36:37.829 --> 36:39.898
AN ASSISTANT?
CASTING DIRECTOR?

36:39.931 --> 36:41.633
- NO.

36:41.667 --> 36:43.635
IT WAS JUST HIM AND ME.

36:43.669 --> 36:45.804
THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN
MY FIRST CLUE.

36:48.974 --> 36:52.344
WE SPENT THE WEEKEND TOGETHER.
I TOLD HIM I WAS A VIRGIN,

36:52.378 --> 36:55.347
AND HE SAID I NEEDED
LIFE EXPERIENCE IF I WANTED

36:55.381 --> 36:57.383
TO BE A REAL ACTRESS.

36:59.518 --> 37:01.520
- SO YOU HAD SEX WITH HIM.

37:05.724 --> 37:07.726
- [sobs]
YEAH. ALL KINDS OF STUFF.

37:13.565 --> 37:18.770
ADAM SAID I WAS A NATURAL AND
HE HAD NEVER MET ANYONE LIKE ME.

37:18.804 --> 37:21.740
HE WAS GONNA MAKE ME A STAR.

37:21.773 --> 37:23.642
I BELIEVED HIM.

37:23.675 --> 37:25.944
I WOULDN'T LET MY PHONE OUT OF
MY SIGHT IN CASE HE CALLED.

37:25.977 --> 37:28.980
I WAS SO STUPID.

37:30.482 --> 37:33.852
- OKAY.

37:33.885 --> 37:36.388
EXCUSE ME,
I HAVE TO GET BACK TO WORK.

37:36.422 --> 37:38.023
- THANK YOU, MAUDE.

37:38.056 --> 37:40.492
- HEY, GUYS,
WHAT CAN I GET FOR YOU?

37:40.526 --> 37:44.330
- LAPD RULED AMANDA FORBES'
DEATH AN ACCIDENTAL DROWNING.

37:44.363 --> 37:46.798
NOT TO MENTION, THIS IS
OUT OF YOUR JURISDICTION.

37:46.832 --> 37:48.367
- AMBER'S NOT THE ISSUE.

37:48.400 --> 37:50.736
- IF IT'S ABOUT TENSLEY,
YOU BOTH KNOW BETTER THAN I DO

37:50.769 --> 37:52.638
THAT SHE'S A PATHOLOGICAL LIAR

37:52.671 --> 37:54.039
WHO'LL SAY ANYTHING
TO GET ATTENTION.

37:54.072 --> 37:56.442
- WELL, IT'S NOT ABOUT
TENSLEY EITHER.

37:56.475 --> 37:57.676
AND HE'S RIGHT,
YOU'RE GONNA GET AWAY

37:57.709 --> 37:59.845
WITH WHAT YOU DID
TO BOTH THOSE GIRLS.

37:59.878 --> 38:01.947
- OKAY, SO WHY ARE WE HERE,
GUYS?

38:01.980 --> 38:03.982
- WHY ARE WE HERE?

38:05.050 --> 38:07.786
- DO YOU REMEMBER HER?

38:07.819 --> 38:08.954
MAUDE PETERSON?

38:08.987 --> 38:09.955
- WHO?

38:09.988 --> 38:11.823
- MAUDE PETERSON.

38:11.857 --> 38:13.925
- WAS SHE AN ACTRESS?

38:13.959 --> 38:15.894
I AUDITION HUNDREDS
OF ACTRESSES.

38:15.927 --> 38:17.896
- YEAH, BUT ONLY ONE IN CANADA.

38:17.929 --> 38:20.932
FOR WINNIPEG NIGHTS,
AND YOU HAD SEX WITH HER?

38:20.966 --> 38:22.434
- LOOK, ARE YOU ASKING,

38:22.468 --> 38:25.437
DID I SLEEP WITH YOUNG,
WANNABE ACTRESSES?

38:25.471 --> 38:27.806
YES.
BUT I KEPT IT LEGAL.

38:27.839 --> 38:28.774
- YOU MAY HAVE THOUGHT YOU DID.

38:28.807 --> 38:31.009
- NO, I DID.
YOU KNOW, I DO REMEMBER HER NOW.

38:31.042 --> 38:32.944
SHE'S 16.

38:32.978 --> 38:35.347
THE AGE OF CONSENT IN CANADA.
NOT ILLEGAL.

38:36.147 --> 38:37.148
- HOLD ON--

38:37.182 --> 38:38.316
- WINNIPEG NIGHTS WAS
NEVER MADE.

38:38.350 --> 38:41.487
- IF YOU PEOPLE UNDERSTOOD
ANYTHING ABOUT THE INDUSTRY,

38:41.520 --> 38:42.554
YOU WOULD KNOW THAT
MOST PROJECTS

38:42.588 --> 38:43.889
NEVER GET OFF THE GROUND.

38:43.922 --> 38:45.957
- RIGHT, BUT THERE'S USUALLY
A SCRIPT, NO?

38:45.991 --> 38:47.125
- THERE WAS.

38:47.158 --> 38:48.894
I REGISTERED ONE
WITH THE WRITER'S GUILD.

38:48.927 --> 38:50.796
- YES, YOU DID.
WE SUBPOENAED IT.

38:50.829 --> 38:52.831
IT'S A TREATMENT WITH

38:52.864 --> 38:55.501
"ALL WORK AND NO PLAY
MAKES ADAM A DULL BOY"

38:55.534 --> 38:59.571
WRITTEN OVER AND OVER AGAIN,
OVER TEN PAGES.

38:59.605 --> 39:00.706
AUTHORED BY YOU.

39:00.739 --> 39:03.509
- OKAY, WE GOTTA STOP NOW.
YOU'RE GONNA BLINDSIDE US

39:03.542 --> 39:05.143
LIKE THIS?
I NEED SOME TIME WITH MY CLIENT.

39:05.176 --> 39:06.144
- NO, NO.
HEY, IT'S ALL RIGHT, IT'S OKAY.

39:06.177 --> 39:07.379
IT'S OKAY, DON.

39:09.948 --> 39:14.520
- MY ASSISTANT MUST HAVE
REGISTERED THE WRONG DOCUMENT.

39:14.553 --> 39:18.957
- YOUR SIGNATURE'S ON
THE REGISTRATION.

39:18.990 --> 39:21.159
WAS THERE EVER ANY KIND
OF LEGITIMATE

39:21.192 --> 39:25.564
PRE-PRODUCTION AT ALL?
A SCHEDULE, A BUDGET...

39:25.597 --> 39:28.400
I'M THE CREATIVE.
YOU'D HAVE TO TALK TO DENNIS.

39:28.434 --> 39:31.403
- WE DID, AND THE ONLY BUDGET
ENTRY THAT HE SUBMITTED

39:31.437 --> 39:35.507
WAS FOR A FIRST-CLASS ROUND TRIP
TICKET TO WINNIPEG,

39:35.541 --> 39:38.810
AND YOUR WEEKEND STAY
AT A HOTEL.

39:38.844 --> 39:40.779
ROOM SERVICE BILLS
WERE QUITE EXTENSIVE,

39:40.812 --> 39:43.515
ESPECIALLY THE PAY-PER-VIEW.

39:43.549 --> 39:45.551
YOU NEVER LEFT THE HOTEL THAT
WHOLE WEEKEND, DID YOU?

39:47.819 --> 39:49.755
- DENNIS, THAT LITTLE
LIMP-WRISTED BEAN COUNTER!

39:49.788 --> 39:50.689
- ADAM! ADAM, PLEASE! PLEASE!
- WHAT KIND OF DEAL DID HE

39:50.722 --> 39:51.923
WORK OUT WITH YOU?
- STOP, ADAM, PLEASE!

39:51.957 --> 39:54.693
- WHO GIVES HIM AUTHORITY TO
TALK TO THESE PEOPLE ABOUT MY--

39:54.726 --> 39:56.628
- WE ARE LEAVING.
- NO, YOU WON'T.

39:56.662 --> 39:57.929
THERE WAS NO MOVIE.
THERE WAS NEVER ANY INTENTION

39:57.963 --> 40:00.065
TO MAKE A MOVIE.
YOUR CLIENT TRAVELED TO CANADA

40:00.098 --> 40:02.100
WITH THE PRIMARY PURPOSE
OF HAVING SEX

40:02.133 --> 40:03.969
WITH SOMEONE
UNDER THE AGE OF 18.

40:04.002 --> 40:05.937
A FEDERAL CRIME.
- WHAT IS HE TALKING ABOUT?

40:05.971 --> 40:07.739
- SEXUAL TOURISM.

40:07.773 --> 40:11.443
SECTION 24-23-C OF TITLE 18.

40:11.477 --> 40:14.446
ENGAGING IN ILLICIT SEXUAL
CONDUCT IN FOREIGN PLACES.

40:14.480 --> 40:19.651
PUNISHABLE BY UP TO 30 YEARS
IN PRISON.

40:19.685 --> 40:21.553
- YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.

40:21.587 --> 40:23.989
THAT LAW'S INTENTION
IS TO STOP PEDOPHILES

40:24.022 --> 40:26.725
FROM FLYING TO THAILAND
TO HAVE SEX WITH 12-YEAR-OLDS.

40:26.758 --> 40:29.928
- YOUR CLIENT IS A PEDOPHILE,
AND A RAPIST,

40:29.961 --> 40:31.930
AND A MURDERER.

40:31.963 --> 40:34.466
AND IF THIS IS THE ONLY WAY
THAT WE CAN GET YOU,

40:34.500 --> 40:37.603
THEN THIS IS THE WAY
THAT YOU'RE GOING DOWN.

40:39.705 --> 40:42.841
- THE FEDS HAVE BEEN WATCHING
THIS INTERROGATION.

40:42.874 --> 40:45.010
THEY'RE OUTSIDE RIGHT NOW.

40:45.043 --> 40:46.612
- ADAM BRUBECK,

40:46.645 --> 40:49.648
PUT YOUR HANDS BEHIND YOUR BACK,
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

41:06.865 --> 41:10.836
- NO, I WAS NOT SURPRISED TO
HEAR OF ADAM BRUBECK'S ARREST.

41:10.869 --> 41:13.171
LIKE SO MANY YOUNG ACTORS
IN HOLLYWOOD,

41:13.204 --> 41:16.041
I FELL VICTIM TO A PREDATOR.

41:16.074 --> 41:20.045
I HARMED SO MANY PEOPLE BECAUSE
I JUST DIDN'T UNDERSTAND

41:20.078 --> 41:21.179
WHAT WAS DONE TO ME.

41:21.212 --> 41:23.181
I AM WORKING THOUGH,
REALLY HARD,

41:23.214 --> 41:26.585
ON STRAIGHTENING OUT MY LIFE,
AND ON MAKING AMENDS

41:26.618 --> 41:28.854
TO EVERYONE THAT I HAVE HURT.

41:28.887 --> 41:31.923
AND WHEN I MEET YOUNG ACTORS
TODAY, I JUST TELL THEM

41:31.957 --> 41:34.893
THAT THEY DON'T HAVE
TO BE VICTIMS TOO.

41:34.926 --> 41:37.629
- THAT IS SO TERRIFIC, WOW.
- THANK YOU.

41:37.663 --> 41:39.197
- NOW I HEAR YOU HAVE A NEW
PROJECT IN THE WORKS.

41:39.230 --> 41:41.266
TELL US ABOUT IT.
- I DO!

41:41.299 --> 41:43.935
SO AFTER THE SIX MONTHS
COMMUNITY SERVICE,

41:43.969 --> 41:47.272
I WILL BE DOING AN ARC ON
ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK.

41:47.305 --> 41:48.874
- SERIOUSLY?

41:48.907 --> 41:49.708
- JUSTICE HAS BEEN SERVED.

41:49.741 --> 41:51.743
I'M SURPRISED SHE DIDN'T
GET THAT ARC

41:51.777 --> 41:52.878
AS HER COMMUNITY SERVICE.

41:52.911 --> 41:53.845
- I DON'T KNOW...

41:53.879 --> 41:55.714
I BET SHE LOOKS HOT
IN A PRISON JUMPSUIT.

41:55.747 --> 41:58.249
- COULD YOU JUST HAND ME MY BAG,
PLEASE? THANK YOU.

41:58.283 --> 42:00.852
I'M SORRY,
CAN YOU TURN THAT OFF, PLEASE?

42:00.886 --> 42:03.755
AMARO, I NEED YOU TO HOLD DOWN
THE FORT FOR A SECOND.

42:03.789 --> 42:05.056
- IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?
- I DON'T KNOW.

42:05.090 --> 42:07.092
NOAH'S IN THE E.R.
