00:44.645 --> 00:47.281
- Yes, mother?
- Jess, honey, why are you doing this?

00:47.381 --> 00:49.450
- I've been through enough...
- Mom, seriously?

00:49.550 --> 00:51.485
We've been through this
like a thousand times.

00:51.585 --> 00:55.789
Do we really have to do this now?
I'm literally about to start my first shift.

00:55.889 --> 00:59.233
Yeah, that's exactly why
we have to do this right now.

00:59.760 --> 01:04.665
Mom, I told you I am going
to be fine, all right?

01:04.765 --> 01:08.068
Most cops go their entire career
without seeing any action.

01:08.168 --> 01:10.741
Yeah, well, tell that to your father.

01:11.605 --> 01:13.043
Nice.

01:13.206 --> 01:17.811
Look, Jess, for me, don't do this.
Hey, do you know what? I got a nice...

01:17.911 --> 01:21.415
Mom, I'm gonna be really late, so I gotta...
Can we talk about this later?

01:21.515 --> 01:24.285
Look, I need to talk about this right now.
I can't take this anymore.

01:24.385 --> 01:26.186
No, because I'm gonna be late
and I'm going to be fired

01:26.286 --> 01:28.656
before I even get through my first day
of work. But I love you. I love you.

01:28.756 --> 01:30.867
Goodbye. Goodbye.

01:40.300 --> 01:41.938
Hello?

02:00.887 --> 02:02.664
Hello?

02:06.693 --> 02:08.870
Anybody in here?

02:11.717 --> 02:13.368
God!

02:17.704 --> 02:20.435
Goddamn son of a bitch!

02:20.841 --> 02:23.210
Fucking! Fucking cop!

02:23.310 --> 02:24.914
Shit!

02:27.014 --> 02:28.715
Hello?

02:31.118 --> 02:32.753
How long have you been there?

02:32.853 --> 02:36.123
- I just walked in. I'm Officer...
- Turn around!

02:36.223 --> 02:39.330
- My order said to report...
- I said, turn around.

02:42.729 --> 02:47.007
Stop! I said, turn around,
not walk away.

02:47.267 --> 02:48.937
Sir...

03:12.492 --> 03:15.968
- I'm Sergeant Cohen.
- Officer Loren.

03:17.130 --> 03:19.366
- Loren?
- Yes, sir.

03:19.466 --> 03:22.069
I... I was told to report here.
It might have been a mistake.

03:22.169 --> 03:24.337
I thought the new station
is up and running already.

03:24.437 --> 03:27.487
Yes, it is. And she's a fucking beauty!

03:27.587 --> 03:29.376
Saint Michael himself
would be impressed.

03:29.476 --> 03:33.630
And tomorrow when you see it you will
fall down upon its steps and weep.

03:33.730 --> 03:36.437
But tonight you're here.

03:38.101 --> 03:39.746
Sir...

03:40.771 --> 03:43.306
I guess I don't understand
what I am doing here.

03:43.406 --> 03:46.509
The real question is what the hell
am I still doing here?

03:46.609 --> 03:48.125
But to answer yours,

03:48.225 --> 03:53.886
you are the lucky rookie to work
the very last shift in this mausoleum.

03:55.719 --> 04:01.992
All 911 calls have been rerouted
to the new station, so it should be quiet.

04:02.092 --> 04:06.029
Okay, you may have some walk-ups,
but just send them up the street.

04:06.596 --> 04:09.273
The address and my number
are on the wall.

04:09.766 --> 04:13.304
If there's an emergency,
call the station.

04:18.408 --> 04:23.886
Here's the kitchen, and the waiting room
down the hall if you get bored.

04:26.983 --> 04:28.935
That's holding, you don't have
to go down there.

04:29.035 --> 04:33.190
- Sarge, can I speak frankly?
- Sure.

04:33.290 --> 04:35.409
Why am I here and not a security guard?

04:40.096 --> 04:42.842
- Let's go, rookie!
- Yes, sir.

04:47.337 --> 04:50.807
This room contains
enough hazardous material

04:50.907 --> 04:53.910
to make Chernobyl look like
fucking bird shit on a windowsill.

04:54.010 --> 04:56.947
Tonight, every hardened
criminal in this area

04:57.047 --> 04:58.916
will do everything
in their power to get to this.

04:59.016 --> 05:02.360
And you will be the only one standing
between them and the total annihilation

05:02.460 --> 05:04.708
of this fucking city.

05:08.892 --> 05:11.895
- I'm messing with you, rookie.
- Oh... I know.

05:11.995 --> 05:16.466
It's not in the department's policy to hire
outside security when we have a whole fleet

05:16.566 --> 05:18.902
- of blue boys on the payroll.
- Right.

05:19.002 --> 05:22.072
The only things left in these cabins
are some needles,

05:22.172 --> 05:24.040
some bloodstained, shit-stained clothes.

05:24.140 --> 05:27.215
Basically all the vile crap that we collect
from perps and crime scenes

05:27.315 --> 05:31.648
that have made their way through evidence
and we can't throw in the trash.

05:31.748 --> 05:34.751
The material was supposed
to be disposed of yesterday

05:34.851 --> 05:37.420
but for whatever reason it wasn't.

05:37.520 --> 05:42.559
So, Hazmat's gonna be here sometime
between 10 PM and 4 AM.

05:42.659 --> 05:44.761
Do not leave.

05:44.861 --> 05:47.864
I repeat, do not leave the premises.

05:47.964 --> 05:50.625
- Understood?
- Yes, sir.

05:50.725 --> 05:53.851
I'll be back to relieve you
when your shift is over.

05:54.704 --> 05:57.819
- Any questions?
- No, sir.

07:20.523 --> 07:22.436
Sanford Police Department.

07:24.527 --> 07:26.162
Hello?

07:27.149 --> 07:29.142
Help me.

07:29.799 --> 07:31.468
I am trapped.

07:31.568 --> 07:35.517
Miss... I am sorry,
you're... Are you injured?

07:35.972 --> 07:38.483
The scream sound won't stop now.

07:39.325 --> 07:42.211
Okay, ma'am, just stay calm.
What's your address?

07:43.446 --> 07:46.292
I think they might all be dead.

07:46.949 --> 07:49.920
All right, ma'am, just...
just give me your address

07:50.020 --> 07:52.788
and I'll dispatch a unit
to your location.

07:54.524 --> 07:55.656
Hello?

07:57.393 --> 07:59.106
Ma'am?

08:00.463 --> 08:02.283
Shit!

08:10.106 --> 08:12.809
- Sanford Police Department.
- Yeah, this is Officer Loren.

08:12.909 --> 08:15.578
I just received a distress call
at the old station.

08:15.678 --> 08:19.883
It was a possible 10-54. I was told
all emergency calls were rerouted, so...

08:19.983 --> 08:24.421
- All calls were rerouted.
- They weren't because I just received one.

08:24.721 --> 08:26.738
Is the line still active?

08:27.123 --> 08:28.767
No.

08:30.093 --> 08:32.794
Were you able to obtain
any of the vic's information?

08:32.895 --> 08:35.410
No, sir. The line was disconnected.

08:38.467 --> 08:40.183
Hello?

08:40.970 --> 08:42.873
I've documented the call
and I'll confirm on my end

08:42.972 --> 08:45.186
that the lines have been
properly rerouted.

08:45.286 --> 08:47.610
If there any issues, I'll let you know.

08:47.710 --> 08:50.430
All right. All right, thank you.

08:58.521 --> 09:00.607
Sergeant Cohen?

09:13.570 --> 09:16.390
Sergeant Cohen is that you, sir?

11:28.871 --> 11:30.691
Sir?

11:31.374 --> 11:34.322
Sir, you have to leave
the station is closed.

11:38.214 --> 11:40.063
Sir!

11:42.051 --> 11:45.406
Sir, if you don't leave the station now
I'm gonna be forced to ta...

11:53.195 --> 11:55.481
Son of a bitch.

12:08.077 --> 12:09.960
Sir?

12:14.684 --> 12:16.995
Sir, you know where you are?

12:17.287 --> 12:19.869
Sir, you're in a police station.

12:20.523 --> 12:22.102
Hey.

12:22.692 --> 12:23.826
Hello?

12:23.926 --> 12:26.837
- Shut up!
- Jesus Christ!

12:27.397 --> 12:30.277
Move. Move!

12:33.269 --> 12:36.620
Get out. Get out!

17:18.688 --> 17:24.126
- Sanford Police Department.
- Please. I need to get out.

17:24.226 --> 17:26.529
Hey, you called earlier, right?
What's your name?

17:26.628 --> 17:30.550
- Monica.
- Monica, okay. Monica, where are you?

17:31.700 --> 17:33.252
I was brought to a ranch.

17:33.352 --> 17:36.335
A ranch, all right.
Do you know the address?

17:36.435 --> 17:37.623
They're coming back.

17:37.723 --> 17:40.376
Tell me quickly, is there anything around
that you can help me locate you?

17:40.476 --> 17:45.333
- Anything that you see, what's near you?
- I don't know. I think...

17:45.715 --> 17:47.183
I think I hear pigs.

17:47.283 --> 17:50.699
Pigs? All right. Is there anything else?

17:50.920 --> 17:52.888
I have to go.

17:52.988 --> 17:54.824
Monica?

17:55.174 --> 17:57.093
Damn it!

17:57.193 --> 17:58.161
Monica?

17:58.261 --> 18:01.664
I think I may have the wrong number.
This is Joe from Bioclean Waste Removal.

18:01.764 --> 18:04.650
Oh, no, no, no. I am sorry. This is
Officer Loren. I was expecting you.

18:04.750 --> 18:07.904
I just wanna give you a heads-up.
We're running a little behind, you know?

18:08.004 --> 18:11.007
I thought we'd be there sooner
but we're dealing with quite a mess here.

18:11.107 --> 18:14.810
Okay, so, what is it going
to be more like... four?

18:14.910 --> 18:18.047
Yeah, you know, I'm not sure.
Maybe sooner but... I'll tell you what,

18:18.147 --> 18:21.668
- I'll call you back if things change.
- All right, that's fine. Thank you, Joe.

18:29.759 --> 18:32.695
- Sanford Police Department.
- Yeah, this is Officer Loren.

18:32.795 --> 18:36.198
I'm calling again from the old station.
I keep receiving 911 calls.

18:36.298 --> 18:38.868
- All calls have been rerouted.
- Yeah...

18:38.968 --> 18:41.837
I know, I called earlier
to report the same issue.

18:41.937 --> 18:45.341
- Are you receiving a high volume of calls?
- No, it's not a high volume of calls.

18:45.441 --> 18:47.894
She's called twice. It's the same girl,
her name is Monica.

18:47.994 --> 18:50.946
She's definitely in some kind of danger.
I can't get much information.

18:51.046 --> 18:53.449
- Did you get her last name?
- Shit! No, I didn't.

18:53.549 --> 18:58.152
But she said that she is on a ranch or some
kind of farm or something, there's pigs.

18:58.852 --> 19:03.593
Okay, she's not dialing 911. So she has
to be dialing your station directly.

19:03.693 --> 19:05.928
Okay. Well, can I trace
her calls from here?

19:06.028 --> 19:08.430
Yeah, I'm afraid I can't trace
a call from that line

19:08.530 --> 19:10.549
but I can start looking into the pigs.

19:10.649 --> 19:15.119
- Alright, what do I do if she calls again?
- Tell her to call 911.

19:15.705 --> 19:18.560
Got it. Thanks.

22:04.406 --> 22:06.542
This is Officer Loren
at the old station.

22:06.642 --> 22:08.911
I'm investigating a B and E.
Possible Code Nine.

22:09.011 --> 22:11.093
Come again?

22:19.621 --> 22:22.132
I repeat possible Code Nine.

22:37.640 --> 22:41.780
"As a law enforcement officer, my fundamental
duty is to safeguard lives and property,

22:41.880 --> 22:44.280
to protect the innocent
against deception,

22:44.380 --> 22:46.682
the peaceful against violence,
or disorder,

22:46.782 --> 22:51.568
and to respect the constitutional rights
of all to liberty, equality and justice."

23:14.576 --> 23:15.912
Show me your hands!

23:16.412 --> 23:18.800
Show me your hands. Do it now!

23:19.982 --> 23:21.831
Shit!

23:47.910 --> 23:51.165
Sir, you can't be in here.
This is a police station.

23:52.748 --> 23:54.734
Take it easy.

23:58.854 --> 24:00.310
Stay on the ground.

24:11.833 --> 24:13.548
Move it.

24:21.243 --> 24:23.049
Get in.

24:24.947 --> 24:29.126
Get off your knees. Get off your knees!

24:45.300 --> 24:47.213
What the fuck?

25:22.771 --> 25:24.044
Hello?

25:25.140 --> 25:28.290
If there's somebody out there
you need to open the door now.

25:29.645 --> 25:32.114
You are interfering
with the duties of an officer.

25:33.014 --> 25:35.897
You let me out now
and I'll only give you a warning.

25:37.519 --> 25:39.332
Fuck!

25:56.338 --> 25:58.053
Shit!

26:12.955 --> 26:16.368
Sir, get back down on the ground.

26:31.073 --> 26:35.377
Sir, give me my flashlight
and get back down on the ground.

26:35.477 --> 26:38.122
Let me remind you I am armed.

26:58.433 --> 27:01.470
- Who is in here?
- I'm not ready to go.

27:01.570 --> 27:04.960
- Who is in here?
- Please. Let me out of here.

27:09.578 --> 27:10.896
Answer me.

27:18.253 --> 27:20.222
Let me out.

27:20.322 --> 27:22.464
Please open the door.

27:22.564 --> 27:25.060
Don't be scared.

27:25.160 --> 27:28.941
Do you want to get out of here alive?

27:32.601 --> 27:37.251
- Who are you?
- I'm gonna hurt you.

27:44.446 --> 27:46.734
Give me my flashlight.

28:18.680 --> 28:24.453
"I will maintain courageous calm
in the face of danger, scorn or ridicule.

28:24.553 --> 28:27.789
I'll develop self-restraint and...

28:27.889 --> 28:30.359
and I'll develop self-restraint

28:30.459 --> 28:33.228
and be constantly mindful
of the welfare of others.

28:33.328 --> 28:36.265
I will be exemplary in obeying
the laws of the land

28:36.365 --> 28:38.983
and the regulations of my department."

29:22.110 --> 29:23.959
Screw it.

29:29.618 --> 29:31.853
You've reached Sergeant Cohen.

29:31.953 --> 29:34.337
Please leave a message.

29:35.157 --> 29:39.706
Sergeant Cohen, this is Officer Loren
down at the old station.

29:40.962 --> 29:43.217
There was a... I'm...

29:43.899 --> 29:45.915
I am calling...

29:47.703 --> 29:49.985
because I am...

29:50.772 --> 29:53.283
I am calling because...

29:56.478 --> 29:59.028
I am happy to be on the force, sir.

30:00.349 --> 30:02.198
Thank you.

31:04.913 --> 31:07.267
Ma'am, can I help you with something?

31:07.516 --> 31:09.017
No, I'm all right.

31:09.117 --> 31:12.421
Well, you can't hang out back here.
This is a police station.

31:12.521 --> 31:15.941
No, it's not. Police station's
on 14th and Anderson.

31:16.041 --> 31:19.192
- Ma'am?
- You can call me Marigold.

31:20.028 --> 31:22.197
No, ma'am, I will not.

31:22.297 --> 31:25.417
My mama gave me that name.
She picked it out herself, swear to God.

31:25.517 --> 31:28.221
Can you please remove yourself
from the premises and...

31:28.321 --> 31:30.363
go about your business?

31:36.511 --> 31:41.833
Look... do you mind if I finish
my cigarette? It feels safer here.

31:41.933 --> 31:45.044
All right, just don't leave
your butt on the step.

31:45.821 --> 31:46.956
Hey!

31:47.656 --> 31:49.524
You're new, right?

31:49.624 --> 31:52.240
- Yeah.
- I thought so.

31:53.295 --> 31:56.744
I can pick a rookie
out of a whole room full of pigs.

31:57.298 --> 32:00.782
Well, you've still got that look
on your face like you give a damn.

32:01.670 --> 32:03.255
Have a good night.

32:03.355 --> 32:05.570
I was here, you know.

32:06.475 --> 32:08.254
Yeah?

32:10.145 --> 32:13.515
Well, the cell next door
but I heard the scream,

32:13.615 --> 32:15.967
when they found him the next morning.

32:17.652 --> 32:19.488
What...

32:19.588 --> 32:20.972
what are you referring to?

32:21.072 --> 32:23.912
When they brought them in that night
three of them,

32:24.012 --> 32:28.230
this wannabe Manson family.
I think they were called the Paymons.

32:28.330 --> 32:31.233
Kidnapped and slaughtered
those poor girls.

32:31.633 --> 32:33.768
Yes, they did.

32:33.868 --> 32:37.606
They also killed the Paymon family
on the scene of the crime, the officers.

32:37.706 --> 32:39.970
I should know,
my father was one of them.

32:40.070 --> 32:43.589
That's what they wanted you to believe.
But they brought 'em in alive.

32:44.646 --> 32:46.928
Bragging about what they'd done and all.

32:47.816 --> 32:49.084
I can see you don't believe me

32:49.184 --> 32:52.567
but I am willing to bet my tits
and a pack of cigarettes, it's the truth.

32:52.667 --> 32:55.348
Well, they kept me up all night...

32:56.791 --> 32:59.202
singing this eerie song.

33:15.911 --> 33:18.165
Then it just stopped.

33:20.215 --> 33:23.764
Those crazy bastards hung themselves
with their own bed sheets.

33:25.086 --> 33:27.956
And the commotion the next morning...

33:28.056 --> 33:30.176
I got a glimpse into their cell.

33:31.092 --> 33:33.407
And the bodies were gone.

33:33.862 --> 33:35.577
But...

33:37.933 --> 33:42.219
pure evil covered those walls.

33:54.883 --> 33:56.730
You okay?

33:57.953 --> 33:59.643
Yeah. No, I'm good.

34:04.459 --> 34:08.215
Well, time to make the doughnuts.

34:09.598 --> 34:12.387
And don't worry
I'm taking my butt with me.

35:08.657 --> 35:11.111
I'm not ashamed of what I do.

35:11.693 --> 35:15.196
You ashamed of paying your taxes,
taking care of your kids, loving your wife?

35:15.396 --> 35:18.400
I do what I do, because it's right.

35:18.500 --> 35:21.736
You ever hit the girl right in the face
with a baseball bat?

35:21.836 --> 35:23.572
We dress ourselves
in the cloak of ignorance...

35:23.672 --> 35:26.556
She didn't even look
like people anymore.

35:26.941 --> 35:28.877
Face swollen,

35:28.977 --> 35:32.047
teeth knocked up inside her forehead.

35:32.147 --> 35:33.582
It got me excited.

35:33.682 --> 35:36.117
She fell to her knees
and bowed to the king.

35:36.217 --> 35:39.133
Are you suggesting
we are devil worshippers?

35:39.721 --> 35:44.076
Devil's just another bitch of the Lord.
Rebel angel that was cast out.

35:44.993 --> 35:46.494
I am not ashamed.

35:46.594 --> 35:50.699
But he is downstairs doing the Lord's
work just like the rest of them.

35:50.799 --> 35:54.655
Punishing the damned for their sins.
That sounds like the Lord's work to me.

35:56.204 --> 35:58.492
But the answer is no.

35:59.040 --> 36:01.323
We don't pray to him.

36:01.743 --> 36:05.780
Devil's been around long before that
clipped-wing cock-sucker got down there.

36:05.880 --> 36:08.425
Who do you think was there before him?

36:09.885 --> 36:12.487
He just took a break for a while.

36:12.587 --> 36:15.834
Searching the world for pretty faces.

36:16.591 --> 36:20.161
- Like me.
- Dead people are always so messy.

36:20.261 --> 36:24.909
There's so much blood
splashing around in there.

36:26.467 --> 36:29.070
Make a couple of holes and it just...

36:29.512 --> 36:31.581
pours out.

36:34.876 --> 36:38.529
I once stabbed a girl
who sounded like a pig.

36:41.183 --> 36:44.970
I once stabbed a girl
who sounded like a pig.

36:50.525 --> 36:53.707
She fell to her knees
and bowed to the king.

36:54.128 --> 36:57.113
That's what Paymon means, you know?

36:58.233 --> 37:00.578
It was destined.

37:00.902 --> 37:03.219
The king of hell.

37:04.139 --> 37:07.141
There was a family back at the ranch.

37:07.241 --> 37:09.293
But not at night...

37:10.098 --> 37:11.978
not yet.

37:12.247 --> 37:14.883
Paymon needs soldiers.

37:14.983 --> 37:16.685
That's why we are heading home...

37:16.785 --> 37:19.954
with guns blazing so he can take
his rightful place...

37:20.054 --> 37:23.600
I am the dancing flame,

37:23.825 --> 37:26.238
a lightning strike,

37:26.461 --> 37:28.613
crippling away.

37:29.764 --> 37:32.067
I'll destroy your homes.

37:32.167 --> 37:34.869
The ones alive within your heart,

37:34.969 --> 37:37.257
the ones you pray for.

37:38.773 --> 37:41.643
I will rape your humanity...

37:41.743 --> 37:46.327
until forgiveness
is what you seek from me.

37:48.249 --> 37:50.096
I like you.

37:50.685 --> 37:53.974
I will come back for you
and all you love.

37:54.756 --> 37:56.536
Mark my words.

37:59.527 --> 38:01.544
I like you.

38:01.996 --> 38:05.149
I will come back for you
and all you love.

38:06.134 --> 38:09.112
Mark my words. I like you.

38:59.320 --> 39:01.389
This is Officer Loren.

39:02.146 --> 39:03.691
- Monica?
- They're dead.

39:03.791 --> 39:06.027
- Monica, is that you?
- They killed them.

39:06.127 --> 39:08.563
Who is dead, honey? Who is dead?

39:08.663 --> 39:10.665
The other girls.

39:10.765 --> 39:12.980
What other girls?

39:13.668 --> 39:17.820
- You've got to help me.
- Okay, Monica...

39:18.239 --> 39:21.710
I can't do anything for you over here.
I need you to hang up and dial 911. Okay?

39:21.810 --> 39:23.245
Can you do that for me?

39:24.245 --> 39:27.299
They won't stop singing.

39:27.882 --> 39:30.842
They keep singing that song.

39:31.586 --> 39:33.299
What?

39:47.302 --> 39:50.305
- Hello?
- I'm here.

39:50.705 --> 39:54.042
I'm here. Monica, what's your last name?

39:55.705 --> 39:59.780
- Young.
- Young? How old are you?

40:00.680 --> 40:04.185
- Seventeen.
- Seventeen, okay.

40:04.285 --> 40:09.290
Monica, I'm at a station that does not
have the ability to track your call.

40:09.390 --> 40:13.661
- So I need you to hang up and call 911.
- Wait!

40:13.761 --> 40:15.480
- They're coming.
- Okay. Okay.

40:15.580 --> 40:18.900
Be very quiet and be very still and listen
to my voice. Are you listening to my voice?

40:19.000 --> 40:21.306
I need you to go somewhere safe.
I need you to find somewhere,

40:21.406 --> 40:25.406
- where you can call 911... 9...
- I can't.

40:25.506 --> 40:28.543
Re-dial is all that's working.

40:28.643 --> 40:30.812
Okay. Then you listen to me, Monica.

40:30.912 --> 40:34.149
Listen to me. Listen to me. Listen to me.
You need to get yourself to safety.

40:34.249 --> 40:37.486
You need to find an opportunity to run
and you need to take it. You need to run.

40:37.586 --> 40:40.622
- You need to run as soon as you can.
- Killing...

40:40.722 --> 40:42.857
Okay. Listen. Listen. Listen.
I have a question for you.

40:42.957 --> 40:46.995
Has anybody there mentioned the name,
John Michael Paymon?

40:47.095 --> 40:50.198
Have you heard that name? Can you think
and tell me that? Has anybody asked you

40:50.298 --> 40:51.366
- or have you heard the name,
- I don't know.

40:51.466 --> 40:53.901
John Michael Paymon?

40:54.001 --> 40:56.170
- I think so.
- You think so?

40:56.270 --> 40:59.240
- Please help me!
- I'm gonna help you. I promise you.

40:59.340 --> 41:02.387
Stay on the phone with me.
I'm gonna help you.

41:35.576 --> 41:38.162
- Sanford Police Department.
- This is Officer Loren at the old station.

41:38.262 --> 41:41.182
- Yup, we spoke earlier.
- Yeah, we did. I got her last name.

41:41.282 --> 41:44.569
It's Young. Monica Young
and she is 17 years old.

41:44.719 --> 41:46.154
Great. Anything else?

41:46.254 --> 41:48.790
She is not able to dial 911
from her phone.

41:48.890 --> 41:50.925
Also, she said that
there are other girls there,

41:51.025 --> 41:54.996
she thinks they're dead and she said
her captors are singing a song.

41:55.096 --> 41:58.342
Okay. A song? Is that it?

41:59.734 --> 42:03.589
I think the remaining members
of the Paymon family might have her.

42:04.739 --> 42:07.475
- Hello?
- Oh, I'm sorry, you're serious?

42:07.575 --> 42:10.845
- I recognized the song.
- Okay, slow down, rookie.

42:10.945 --> 42:15.726
Look, the Paymon family, they scattered
and they are under constant surveillance.

42:15.926 --> 42:18.086
- Do you have a pen?
- Yes.

42:18.186 --> 42:20.021
Write this down...

42:20.121 --> 42:26.027
John-Victor-Ida-one-five-two-six-three.

42:26.127 --> 42:27.295
Okay.

42:27.395 --> 42:31.545
You get any more information you reference
that report number when you call back.

42:31.799 --> 42:33.612
Okay.

42:34.068 --> 42:36.020
Thanks.

43:36.897 --> 43:40.948
Oh, my God!
You guys are fucking with me.

43:42.203 --> 43:47.160
All right, enough you guys. You got me,
all right? The joke is on the rookie.

43:47.942 --> 43:50.929
Real fucking funny.

43:51.930 --> 43:53.609
Yeah, it's real fucking funny.

44:02.690 --> 44:05.101
Come out, shit heads!

44:07.228 --> 44:11.018
You guys are a bunch of fucking cowards.

44:11.265 --> 44:12.333
Unbelievable.

44:12.433 --> 44:17.649
You got me pretty good. I got to say,
you got me pretty, pretty good.

44:31.719 --> 44:33.387
So?

44:33.487 --> 44:35.266
So...

44:35.823 --> 44:39.302
- What?
- Is it just you or are there others?

44:40.761 --> 44:44.765
- No, it's just me.
- Well, that's real fucking mature.

44:44.865 --> 44:47.835
I am... I'm not following you.

44:48.035 --> 44:50.471
Is this like your thing?
Is this what you do with your friends?

44:50.571 --> 44:53.074
You put every rookie
through this little fun house?

44:53.174 --> 44:56.777
Well... I don't think
that we are on the same page.

44:56.877 --> 45:00.567
I came over here to check on you.
I'm Officer Ryan Price.

45:02.817 --> 45:06.438
You're not...
you are not fucking with me?

45:07.521 --> 45:11.377
No. I swear on my life.

45:11.592 --> 45:13.673
Can I come in?

45:13.928 --> 45:16.378
- Yeah. I guess.
- Okay.

45:23.838 --> 45:26.107
So, first night?

45:26.207 --> 45:28.809
Yeah. How do you know?

45:28.909 --> 45:34.498
Just the blinding gleam of your uniform
is kind of a dead giveaway.

45:36.550 --> 45:39.821
Well, you came to check on me
and you've checked on me,

45:39.921 --> 45:43.591
so now if you don't mind,
I actually have a lot of work to do.

45:44.936 --> 45:48.246
Yeah. You seem super busy.

45:50.965 --> 45:54.769
Wait... was that,
was that like a frown smile?

45:55.269 --> 45:57.616
Was that, like, a fr-ile?

46:00.308 --> 46:01.676
All right. So what's your story?

46:01.776 --> 46:05.847
You got the short end of the straw
or you just got really unlucky?

46:06.347 --> 46:07.448
Excuse me?

46:07.848 --> 46:10.585
Well, someone made you come here
and check on me, right?

46:10.685 --> 46:15.301
No. I don't... If you ask me,
I'm feeling pretty lucky.

46:17.591 --> 46:21.829
Well, to be honest,
I don't completely mind the company.

46:21.929 --> 46:25.733
- Rough night, I take it?
- Yeah, yeah. You could say that.

46:25.833 --> 46:30.704
- That sounds terrible. What happened?
- Well, let's see.

46:30.804 --> 46:35.309
There is a crazy, homeless man
in holding as we speak.

46:35.409 --> 46:37.892
He pissed all over my lobby.

46:39.614 --> 46:41.749
It's not really funny.

46:41.849 --> 46:45.786
- It's... it's kind of funny.
- Actually, it was pretty gross.

46:45.886 --> 46:50.324
Gross? I once had a perp shit
all over the back seat of my squad car.

46:50.924 --> 46:54.073
Well... you win.

47:00.701 --> 47:02.784
Are you okay?

47:04.238 --> 47:07.186
Yeah. I'm fine.

47:08.676 --> 47:10.525
Listen...

47:11.579 --> 47:14.482
honestly, when I found out
you were working this shift,

47:14.582 --> 47:17.302
I snuck away to come and see you.

47:18.686 --> 47:20.307
I knew your father.

47:26.660 --> 47:29.664
- Were you with him that night?
- Yeah.

47:29.764 --> 47:33.334
I was there when that Paymon fuck sh...

47:33.434 --> 47:34.635
- It's okay.
- No, I'm sorry.

47:34.735 --> 47:39.122
No, it's okay. I wanna know.
They never disclosed the details.

47:41.041 --> 47:45.746
He and I arrived early
on the scene and...

47:45.846 --> 47:48.149
we were ordered to wait for backup.

47:48.249 --> 47:51.485
But we could hear these poor girls

47:51.585 --> 47:55.136
just begging for their lives.

47:55.623 --> 47:57.872
So we went in.

47:58.526 --> 48:00.728
And they opened fire.

48:00.828 --> 48:04.199
And I was able to pull out four girls

48:04.299 --> 48:07.019
while your dad held them off.

48:08.402 --> 48:12.540
They killed six more girls
and two officers,

48:12.640 --> 48:14.819
including your father.

48:18.245 --> 48:20.631
He was a good cop.

48:21.248 --> 48:24.059
And he'd be so proud of you.

48:26.554 --> 48:29.623
Listen, I... I really have to go.

48:29.723 --> 48:32.326
You... you really don't have to go.

48:32.426 --> 48:35.329
I didn't mean what I said,
I'm sorry if I was rude. You can stay.

48:35.429 --> 48:37.381
No, I...

48:37.481 --> 48:40.970
Trust me, I'd love to but...

48:41.669 --> 48:45.873
If you need anything at all
just give me a call,

48:45.973 --> 48:49.377
and I can pop right over
and check on you.

48:49.477 --> 48:52.947
- Do you remember my name?
- Officer Price.

48:53.147 --> 48:54.815
Right.

48:55.215 --> 48:57.235
I'll see you around.

49:18.672 --> 49:20.726
Officer Price?

49:40.461 --> 49:44.380
It's so dark in here. It's cold.

49:51.455 --> 49:54.710
Get down! Fuckin' get down right now.

50:03.551 --> 50:05.764
No, please!

51:37.044 --> 51:40.080
Help! Help!

51:40.180 --> 51:42.930
Help me! Help!

51:43.030 --> 51:45.869
Help! Get me out!

51:46.921 --> 51:51.192
Calm down! Calm down! Calm down!
Calm down! Calm down! What's wrong?

51:51.442 --> 51:53.925
Get me out! Come on!

51:57.865 --> 52:01.869
- I need to get out of here.
- This isn't real. This isn't real.

52:01.969 --> 52:04.689
- Get me out!
- This isn't real.

52:09.677 --> 52:12.657
Don't leave me in here!

52:31.299 --> 52:34.935
<i>From the kingdom of our father</i>

52:35.035 --> 52:38.739
<i>The truth will be free</i>

52:38.839 --> 52:42.476

52:42.576 --> 52:46.246

52:46.346 --> 52:49.776

<i>On the last day I will follow</i>

52:57.357 --> 53:01.028
<i>My soul I will bring</i>

53:02.004 --> 53:05.766
<i>From the kingdom of our father</i>

53:05.866 --> 53:09.503
<i>The truth will be free</i>

53:09.603 --> 53:13.407

53:20.647 --> 53:24.318
<i>Of my master, my king</i>

53:24.418 --> 53:28.122
<i>On the last day I will follow</i>

53:28.222 --> 53:31.926
<i>My soul I will bring</i>

53:32.526 --> 53:36.296
<i>From the kingdom of our father</i>

53:36.396 --> 53:40.100
<i>The truth will be free</i>

53:40.200 --> 53:43.837
<i>Through the mountains I'll be guided</i>

53:43.937 --> 53:47.175
<i>Until I do see</i>

53:47.675 --> 53:50.845
<i>I am safe in the arms</i>

53:51.145 --> 53:54.648
<i>Of my master, my king</i>

53:54.948 --> 53:58.452
<i>On the last day I will follow</i>

53:58.652 --> 54:02.456
<i>My soul I will bring...</i>

54:51.672 --> 54:55.342
- Yeah?
- Sir, this is Officer Loren.

54:55.442 --> 54:58.479
- Is the place on fire?
- No, sir.

54:58.579 --> 55:01.982
- Are you dying?
- No, sir.

55:02.082 --> 55:05.035
Then why the fuck are you calling me?

55:06.453 --> 55:08.468
I don't know.

55:09.489 --> 55:12.092
I am seeing things, I think.

55:12.192 --> 55:13.861
What?

55:14.161 --> 55:15.910
Like...

55:17.230 --> 55:20.486
I just don't know if I can finish
the end of the shift, sir.

55:21.568 --> 55:26.140
Missy, if you can't handle one night alone
in an empty police station

55:26.240 --> 55:29.076
then I think you picked
the wrong line of work.

55:29.176 --> 55:32.647
Apparently, the apple fell pretty far
from the fucking tree.

55:32.747 --> 55:36.383
So, should I inform the Captain
of your resignation

55:36.483 --> 55:40.068
or should I expect to see you
at the end of the shift?

55:42.389 --> 55:44.725
You'll see me at the end
of the shift, sir.

55:44.825 --> 55:46.360
Good.

55:46.460 --> 55:48.668
And don't call me again.

55:59.273 --> 56:00.474
This is Joe.

56:00.574 --> 56:03.811
Hey Joe, this is Officer Loren. What time
you guys are gonna be down here?

56:03.911 --> 56:08.281
I'm knee deep in shit right now. I told you,
I'd call you back if things change.

56:08.381 --> 56:11.251
All right, I'm going to be waiting for you
outside in my squad car, okay?

56:11.351 --> 56:14.633
- Yeah, whatever lady.
- Thanks, Joe.

57:04.637 --> 57:06.146
- Hello.
- I escaped.

57:06.246 --> 57:09.109
- You escaped?
- I'm running.

57:09.209 --> 57:13.080
Okay. Okay. This is good.
This is good. What's around you?

57:13.180 --> 57:15.182
- Woods.
- Okay. What else?

57:15.282 --> 57:18.518
- Wait. There's a sign.
- Okay, what does it say?

57:18.618 --> 57:19.953
Carmichael Road.

57:20.053 --> 57:22.490
Perfect. All right, is anybody
following you right now?

57:22.590 --> 57:25.225
I don't... I don't know. I think so.

57:25.325 --> 57:27.461
- Okay. Just hang tight, okay?
- Don't go.

57:27.561 --> 57:30.464
No, I'm not going. I'll just gonna call
the dispatch on my cell phone

57:30.564 --> 57:33.207
and we're gonna get a unit
over to your location ASAP.

57:33.307 --> 57:34.783
Hurry!

57:38.705 --> 57:40.974
You there?

57:41.074 --> 57:43.290
They're getting close.

57:46.313 --> 57:49.082
I'm gonna die, I know it.

57:49.182 --> 57:51.419
You're not... you're not gonna die.

57:51.519 --> 57:54.468
- I don't wanna die.
- You're not gonna die.

58:01.828 --> 58:05.083
Monica, is there anything around you
you can use it as a weapon.

58:09.736 --> 58:12.305
They are right next to me.

58:12.405 --> 58:14.288
I'm here.

58:19.913 --> 58:21.660
Hello?

58:26.426 --> 58:28.138
Shit!

58:29.756 --> 58:31.491
Police Department.

58:31.591 --> 58:33.794
- Hello?
- Sanford Police Department.

58:33.894 --> 58:35.896
Yeah, this is Officer Loren.

58:35.996 --> 58:40.483
Please reference John-Victor-Ida-
one-five-two-six-three.

58:40.834 --> 58:42.886
Please hold.

58:44.771 --> 58:46.573
- Officer Loren?
- Yes.

58:46.673 --> 58:49.843
- We spoke earlier regarding Monica Young.
- Yes, I have her location.

58:49.943 --> 58:52.729
- I got in touch with her.
- Officer, she's dead.

58:53.713 --> 58:57.885
What? No, no, no. I literally
just got off the phone with her.

58:57.985 --> 59:00.571
No, she's been dead for a year.

59:01.755 --> 59:03.805
Officer Loren?

59:04.558 --> 59:05.692
Yes.

59:05.792 --> 59:08.562
She was the last victim
of the Paymon Family Massacre.

59:08.662 --> 59:12.915
Her body was found in the woods,
beaten to death with a baseball bat.

59:13.200 --> 59:17.471
I don't understand.
I was just speaking to her. I was...

59:17.571 --> 59:20.874
Look... there were only three
family members linked to the murders

59:20.974 --> 59:23.543
but there were over a dozen more
living in the commune.

59:23.643 --> 59:25.045
Maybe you were right.

59:25.145 --> 59:29.265
There's a chance that the calls are coming
from one of them. Playing a sick joke.

59:30.483 --> 59:32.200
Or...

59:32.652 --> 59:34.735
Or what?

59:35.322 --> 59:37.224
This is just between
the two of us, okay?

59:37.324 --> 59:39.293
Nobody likes to talk
about it in the department,

59:39.393 --> 59:43.163
but it was more than just rusty pipes
that got us out of that building.

59:43.263 --> 59:46.266
The Paymon family wasn't killed
on the scene like the news said.

59:46.366 --> 59:50.710
They committed suicide in holding,
and after that, well...

59:51.003 --> 59:53.006
things started happening.

59:53.106 --> 59:55.709
At first it was small,
like the lights turning on and off.

59:55.809 --> 59:58.664
Missing evidence. Abnormal sightings.

59:59.847 --> 01:00:03.250
Soon we couldn't house perps in our
own cells without them freaking out.

01:00:03.350 --> 01:00:05.341
The captain had enough
and he pleaded with the county...

01:00:05.441 --> 01:00:07.301
I gotta go.

01:03:14.674 --> 01:03:18.589
- Hello?
- Look, I'm sorry about earlier.

01:03:18.945 --> 01:03:22.782
- Mom.
- I was wrong to bring up your father.

01:03:22.882 --> 01:03:26.001
- Oh, shit!
- Is everything all right?

01:03:27.353 --> 01:03:29.489
- Jess?
- I gotta call you back.

01:03:29.589 --> 01:03:31.879
- I just don't like how you say good-bye.
- I gotta call you back, all right?

01:03:31.979 --> 01:03:33.846
I love...

01:03:38.665 --> 01:03:42.035
Hey! Hey!

01:03:42.535 --> 01:03:43.950
Hey!

01:04:15.735 --> 01:04:19.817
I don't think you've realized just how lucky
you are to be a part of all this.

01:04:23.042 --> 01:04:26.391
How do I know
this is even really happening?

01:04:29.148 --> 01:04:31.198
Do you see this gun in my hand?

01:04:31.851 --> 01:04:35.934
Maybe that gun is still in my belt.

01:04:36.523 --> 01:04:40.279
Maybe I'm talking to a wall.

01:04:40.660 --> 01:04:45.198
Maybe I have gone as bat-shit-crazy
as I think you are.

01:04:45.298 --> 01:04:48.182
I could pull the trigger
and we could find out.

01:04:56.209 --> 01:04:59.879
If crazy is being devoted
to something you love,

01:04:59.979 --> 01:05:04.765
then I'm as crazy
as a slimy snail in a tin can.

01:05:06.719 --> 01:05:08.869
I would do anything for him.

01:05:10.557 --> 01:05:14.919
I'm a little jealous that he took
those two bitches with him that night.

01:05:16.629 --> 01:05:19.440
Should have been me.

01:05:24.237 --> 01:05:26.286
I forgive him.

01:05:27.874 --> 01:05:30.324
I can never stay mad at John Michael.

01:05:31.411 --> 01:05:33.380
You need to give me
my fucking weapon back.

01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:37.261
- You need to shut the fuck up!
- Okay.

01:05:43.356 --> 01:05:45.876
Have you seen him here tonight?

01:05:46.526 --> 01:05:50.263
You have. I knew it. I felt him.

01:05:50.363 --> 01:05:53.807
Tonight is the one-year anniversary
of his death.

01:05:53.907 --> 01:05:57.989
And I'm here to celebrate it. So...

01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:09.676
Yes?

01:07:10.276 --> 01:07:12.528
They know where I am.

01:07:13.012 --> 01:07:17.116
- Who the fuck is this?
- Monica.

01:07:17.216 --> 01:07:19.902
Monica is dead.

01:09:05.488 --> 01:09:07.341
I don't wanna die.

01:09:16.603 --> 01:09:18.654
Please.

01:09:41.394 --> 01:09:44.683
Fuck! What the fuck?

01:10:22.201 --> 01:10:23.736
Hello?

01:10:23.836 --> 01:10:25.888
Cuddle Bug.

01:10:30.076 --> 01:10:31.878
Dad!

01:10:31.978 --> 01:10:34.264
I missed you.

01:10:35.615 --> 01:10:38.718
This isn't... this isn't real.

01:10:38.818 --> 01:10:41.072
It is baby.

01:10:41.587 --> 01:10:43.289
I'm so proud of you.

01:10:43.389 --> 01:10:46.292
You're just like your old man, you know?

01:10:46.392 --> 01:10:48.761
Strong, dedicated.

01:10:48.861 --> 01:10:51.072
Loyal to the job.

01:10:52.298 --> 01:10:55.644
I did it for you.

01:10:56.235 --> 01:10:58.955
Then why were you trying to leave?

01:10:59.138 --> 01:11:01.756
I laid down my life for this job.

01:11:02.141 --> 01:11:04.644
I expect you to do the same.

01:11:04.744 --> 01:11:09.008
I'm sorry, Dad. I'm really sorry.
I just got really scared.

01:11:09.348 --> 01:11:12.294
But I won't leave. Okay?

01:11:13.419 --> 01:11:15.964
That's my Cuddle Bug.

01:11:17.290 --> 01:11:21.237
Now, the man that took your father's life
is still in this building.

01:11:22.528 --> 01:11:25.044
I want you to do something about it.

01:11:29.836 --> 01:11:31.551
Dad?

01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:36.153
Dad?

01:11:36.709 --> 01:11:38.456
Dad?

01:11:54.627 --> 01:11:56.806
Hey, how did you get out?

01:11:57.396 --> 01:11:59.711
Get on your knees.

01:12:01.567 --> 01:12:05.820
All the way down. Come on.
Hands behind your back.

01:12:06.906 --> 01:12:09.151
Fucking killing me man.

01:13:15.908 --> 01:13:19.590
This is Jessica Loren at the old station.
I'm in need of assistance.

01:13:21.213 --> 01:13:24.935
I repeat, officer in need
of fucking assistance.

01:16:05.978 --> 01:16:07.728
Jessica.

01:16:08.128 --> 01:16:10.933
Come on. I swear on my life.

01:16:11.033 --> 01:16:13.344
I'm not fucking with you.

01:16:40.780 --> 01:16:43.916
"I recognize this badge as a symbol
of fearlessness and faith

01:16:44.016 --> 01:16:47.886
to be held so long as I am true
to the ethics of the police service.

01:16:47.986 --> 01:16:51.057
I will constantly strive to achieve
these objectives and ideals,

01:16:51.157 --> 01:16:53.325
dedicating myself before God

01:16:53.425 --> 01:16:57.174
to my chosen profession,
law enforcement."

01:17:10.876 --> 01:17:14.157
- Daddy?
- Jessica.

01:17:14.580 --> 01:17:16.727
They're coming, baby.

01:17:18.117 --> 01:17:20.069
You have to stop them.

01:17:20.586 --> 01:17:22.465
Whatever it takes.

01:17:24.290 --> 01:17:26.573
Who is coming?

01:17:46.612 --> 01:17:48.629
Don't move!

01:17:55.087 --> 01:17:59.337
You're gonna die, pretty little bitch.
Come on and find us.

01:18:12.271 --> 01:18:16.323
Father Paymon's ghost belongs to us.

01:18:58.484 --> 01:19:02.588
- Come here, bitch!
- You're gonna die, you fucking bitch!

01:19:02.688 --> 01:19:05.208
You're gonna die, bitch!

01:19:19.405 --> 01:19:21.173
...he is more powerful than you.

01:19:21.273 --> 01:19:25.161
He is righteous, he is the way.
You will die.

01:19:31.116 --> 01:19:33.165
Don't move!

01:19:34.253 --> 01:19:38.190
The blood of his children
will resurrect as flesh.

01:19:38.290 --> 01:19:42.276
And all who oppose him will perish.

01:19:53.305 --> 01:19:55.186
Sarge?

01:20:05.584 --> 01:20:09.822
- Don't move, hands behind your head.
- Help me! Somebody help me!

01:20:10.122 --> 01:20:13.092
Lady, what you're doing?
It's me, I'm Joe, from Bioclean.

01:20:13.192 --> 01:20:15.336
- I talked to you earlier today.
- Drop the weapon.

01:20:15.436 --> 01:20:18.696
- No! Please don't do this.
- Drop!

01:20:31.810 --> 01:20:33.591
No.

01:20:34.380 --> 01:20:36.799
No, it's not...

01:20:53.198 --> 01:20:57.386
It wasn't him. It wasn't him.

01:21:08.580 --> 01:21:10.282
Dispatch, this is Sergeant Cohen,

01:21:10.382 --> 01:21:13.994
I have an officer down
and in need of immediate assistance.

01:21:14.094 --> 01:21:15.766
I have...

01:21:30.369 --> 01:21:34.035
<i>Through the mountains I'll be guided</i>

01:21:34.135 --> 01:21:37.570
<i>Until I do see...</i>
