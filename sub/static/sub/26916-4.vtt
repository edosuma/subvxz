WEBVTT

00:11.000 --> 00:13.200
[Uhtred] I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred.

00:13.280 --> 00:14.800
I am a Dane for life.

00:14.880 --> 00:19.800
I have stolen the mystic woman Skade
from the Danish warrior Earl Sigurd.

00:19.880 --> 00:22.880
She's mine. If I have to kill you,
then that is what I'll do.

00:22.960 --> 00:26.160
[Uhtred] King Alfred seeks to
protect his legacy,

00:26.240 --> 00:29.080
but his son, Edward,
refuses an arranged marriage.

00:29.160 --> 00:30.840
I am married to Ecgwynn.

00:30.920 --> 00:33.240
Your wife will be dealt with.

00:33.320 --> 00:35.080
[Uhtred] His daughter,
the Lady of Mercia,

00:35.160 --> 00:37.400
has fled to a nunnery for safety.

00:37.480 --> 00:39.880
I have not forgotten what the bitch did.

00:40.720 --> 00:42.040
I will never forget!

00:42.120 --> 00:43.880
[Uhtred] I rescued her in the past.

00:43.960 --> 00:45.680
And now she needs me again.

00:46.480 --> 00:50.120
The Danes have formed one army
under my brother, Ragnar.

00:50.200 --> 00:54.800
They plan to march south on Wessex,
leaving me with an impossible choice.

00:54.880 --> 00:56.040
Do you stand with us?

00:56.120 --> 00:57.320
I am needed.

00:57.400 --> 00:59.680
You're a whore to the Crown of Alfred.

00:59.760 --> 01:02.120
He does not leave with Skade.
She belongs to me.

01:02.200 --> 01:06.080
Yes, Bloodhair. You can fight
for the witch... to the death.

01:06.640 --> 01:09.480
Agreed. We fight.

01:09.560 --> 01:11.040
[Uhtred] Destiny is all!

01:12.400 --> 01:14.400
[theme music playing]

01:52.400 --> 01:54.040
[crowd shouting indistinctly]

01:54.800 --> 01:56.960
[man 1] Come on, Lord. That's it!

01:57.560 --> 01:58.680
Kill him, Bloodhair!

01:59.720 --> 02:00.880
[man 2] Get him!

02:02.600 --> 02:04.160
[Brida] Come on! Kill him!

02:04.240 --> 02:05.520
Go!

02:05.600 --> 02:07.320
-[Brida] Kill him!
-[man 3] Finish him!

02:12.440 --> 02:13.640
[grunting]

02:13.720 --> 02:15.200
[crowd shouting indistinctly]

02:17.240 --> 02:18.920
[man 4] Yes, yes! Get him, Lord!

02:19.000 --> 02:20.080
[grunts]

02:20.960 --> 02:23.440
-[man 5] Get up, Dane-slayer!
-[Brida] Get up!

02:23.520 --> 02:24.360
You dirty bastards!

02:25.040 --> 02:26.280
[grunting]

02:27.240 --> 02:29.320
[Finan] Come on, Lord! Get his shield!

02:29.400 --> 02:30.400
Come on!

02:30.480 --> 02:32.560
[grunting]

02:34.200 --> 02:35.800
If you want to play that game!

02:35.880 --> 02:37.800
You are happy with this, Ragnar?

02:37.880 --> 02:39.880
You believe this to be a fair fight?

02:41.320 --> 02:42.360
It's a fight.

02:43.280 --> 02:44.560
He deserves it. Kill him!

02:44.640 --> 02:46.320
-Take his balls!
-[screaming]

02:47.560 --> 02:48.480
[Brida] Kill him!

02:51.720 --> 02:52.840
[grunts]

02:52.920 --> 02:54.560
[Brida] Kill him, Bloodhair!

02:54.640 --> 02:55.960
Come on!

02:56.840 --> 02:59.280
-[Finan] Take his legs off!
-[Brida] Kill him!

03:01.240 --> 03:03.920
Uhtred! Lord! Here!

03:05.040 --> 03:06.000
His shoulder!

03:07.360 --> 03:08.720
[Bloodhair groans]

03:10.680 --> 03:12.240
Yes! Finish him!

03:13.520 --> 03:15.000
-[Finan] Yes, Lord.
-[groans]

03:17.400 --> 03:18.240
[grunts]

03:19.000 --> 03:20.240
[panting]

03:23.280 --> 03:24.960
-[grunts]
-[man 6] What the hell?

03:28.640 --> 03:30.080
It's over.

03:30.160 --> 03:32.560
No! It's not over until he's dead.

03:32.640 --> 03:33.840
I say it is over.

03:33.920 --> 03:35.200
I demand my woman.

03:35.280 --> 03:39.160
I will not lose one single man before
the true battle has even begun.

03:39.240 --> 03:40.400
It was to the death!

03:40.480 --> 03:42.360
If you disagree with me
then fight me.

03:42.440 --> 03:44.080
Kill him, Ragnar, and be done.

03:44.160 --> 03:46.720
It is over! It is done.

03:46.800 --> 03:48.120
Take what belongs to you.

03:48.760 --> 03:49.800
Take your witch.

03:49.880 --> 03:51.320
She belongs to me!

03:52.480 --> 03:55.240
I shall see you across the battlefield.
No doubt...

03:55.320 --> 03:56.320
I will kill you.

03:58.720 --> 04:00.800
[Brida] Leave while you're still alive.

04:00.880 --> 04:02.680
Alfred needs his ass to be wiped.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.400
Enjoy your prize.

04:29.080 --> 04:30.480
You ride with me now.

04:33.280 --> 04:34.200
[Bloodhair] Skade!

04:35.320 --> 04:37.560
He must remain cursed. It's your duty!

04:37.640 --> 04:40.040
He has defeated you twice over.

04:40.720 --> 04:41.880
I belong to Uhtred now.

04:41.960 --> 04:43.000
Never.

04:43.560 --> 04:46.200
I've tasted your blood.
What you see is mine!

04:50.000 --> 04:51.960
Ragnar, he cannot be allowed to leave.

04:52.040 --> 04:53.280
[grunts]

04:55.280 --> 04:58.280
Didn't mean to miss! Next time, I won't.

04:58.360 --> 04:59.920
The gates! Now.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.120
Let us be rid of them.

05:23.560 --> 05:25.480
Earl Ragnar, Lord Cnut.

05:25.560 --> 05:28.360
Can either of you tell me why
we allowed Uhtred to leave?

05:28.440 --> 05:30.400
We are gifting Alfred his best warrior.

05:30.480 --> 05:31.960
What is it you suggest we do?

05:32.040 --> 05:34.000
I suggest we kill him.

05:34.800 --> 05:37.560
We can still kill him, all of them.
Apart from your sister.

05:37.640 --> 05:41.120
But we cannot allow Uhtred the Dane-slayer
to return to Wessex

05:41.200 --> 05:42.560
and slay more Danes.

05:42.640 --> 05:44.000
What is your worth?

05:45.240 --> 05:47.240
It was you who helped create these events.

05:48.560 --> 05:50.080
Tell me why not to kill you.

05:51.560 --> 05:54.000
I am the reason we are gathered here.

05:54.080 --> 05:57.640
His worth is that he can drip poison
into the ears of Saxons.

05:57.720 --> 05:58.560
Exactly.

05:58.640 --> 05:59.800
[grunts]

06:03.240 --> 06:04.240
Ragnar!

06:04.320 --> 06:06.360
-[grunting]
-[Cnut] Ragnar!

06:07.600 --> 06:08.440
Ragnar!

06:09.640 --> 06:11.360
You drip poison into every ear!

06:11.440 --> 06:15.360
You smear everything around you with shit!

06:15.440 --> 06:19.000
It's Uhtred you're angry with.
He has caused this division.

06:19.080 --> 06:22.360
-Ignore this piece of weasel shit...
-[groaning]

06:22.440 --> 06:25.440
...and remember, we have a task ahead.

06:26.720 --> 06:30.120
Cousin, you are our leader now.

06:30.200 --> 06:33.160
I am hungry for blood and battle!

06:35.560 --> 06:36.600
Nothing has changed.

06:37.160 --> 06:39.880
We've lost a handful of men
and nothing more than that.

06:41.160 --> 06:42.400
[breathing heavily]

06:43.320 --> 06:44.640
Nothing has changed.

06:46.880 --> 06:48.000
We march

06:48.080 --> 06:49.320
as soon as we're ready.

07:00.560 --> 07:02.040
-[straining]
-Get up.

07:05.400 --> 07:07.000
He took me by surprise.

07:08.080 --> 07:10.960
-Otherwise, I would have made a contest.
-You were right to speak out.

07:12.320 --> 07:14.240
He should never have been
allowed to leave.

07:14.320 --> 07:17.720
That was... weak of my cousin.

07:24.480 --> 07:25.640
[groans]

07:38.320 --> 07:41.160
[Beocca] Uhtred. Uhtred.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.640
This is where we must leave you.

07:45.640 --> 07:49.400
There's a ship waiting at Eoferwic.
Alfred will be wondering where we are.

07:49.640 --> 07:51.880
Alfred will know exactly where you are.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.240
Yes, that is most likely.

07:56.720 --> 07:59.880
Do not get yourself killed
until Aethelflaed is safe.

08:00.400 --> 08:01.720
That would be unfortunate.

08:01.800 --> 08:04.160
It would. And I would have had
a wasted journey.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.800
Aethelflaed is important to the King
and to all Saxons.

08:10.720 --> 08:12.600
After she is safe, what then?

08:13.800 --> 08:15.080
Fate will decide.

08:24.400 --> 08:27.280
Uhtred. You are my brother...

08:27.880 --> 08:30.000
and you shall always be my brother.

09:08.320 --> 09:09.560
[Steapa] Haesten...

09:11.440 --> 09:13.200
only you may enter the palace.

09:13.280 --> 09:14.240
[scoffs]

09:15.840 --> 09:17.240
You must give up your weapons.

09:33.960 --> 09:35.760
-Earl Haesten.
-Lord King.

09:36.640 --> 09:39.080
It is a considerable journey
you have made.

09:39.160 --> 09:40.320
A necessary journey.

09:40.400 --> 09:43.280
Is your wife with you?
I would like to hear of her faith.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.440
Sadly not, Lady.

09:47.120 --> 09:48.240
Pity.

09:48.320 --> 09:49.320
Ale, Lord?

09:52.040 --> 09:53.160
I know you.

09:54.560 --> 09:57.200
-You're the warrior priest.
-I am just a priest.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.120
Father Pyrlig.

09:59.200 --> 10:00.960
[Alfred] You have been
to the north, Haesten.

10:01.480 --> 10:03.920
[Haesten] I have, Lord, to Dunholm.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.960
I journeyed there with Bloodhair,
who remains with Ragnar,

10:08.680 --> 10:09.680
alongside Uhtred...

10:10.880 --> 10:12.120
and Aethelwold.

10:12.800 --> 10:14.520
Aethelwold is there?

10:15.840 --> 10:16.760
He is.

10:16.840 --> 10:18.640
No doubt spreading rumor.

10:19.920 --> 10:22.680
-They are building an army, I assume?
-They are.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.920
The plan is to march
before deepest winter makes it impossible.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.240
They will march

10:28.880 --> 10:31.800
from north to south as a single army.

10:31.880 --> 10:34.720
The further south they come,
the greater they will grow.

10:36.640 --> 10:38.160
They will attract warriors.

10:38.240 --> 10:40.800
[Haesten] Hmm, that is true.

10:42.200 --> 10:44.760
[inhales] If it were my place

10:45.480 --> 10:49.840
to advise you, Lord, I would suggest
you march out to meet them.

10:55.800 --> 10:57.360
Thank you, Haesten.

10:59.560 --> 11:02.800
Your loyalty to our agreement
will not go unrewarded.

11:03.880 --> 11:05.960
Thank you, Lord. Lady.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.200
Despite Aethelwold's obsessive insolence,

11:15.640 --> 11:20.200
I did never believe he could turn wholly
against his father and his homeland.

11:20.880 --> 11:22.240
And his king.

11:24.400 --> 11:25.880
It can only mean death.

11:29.320 --> 11:30.320
Yes.

11:34.000 --> 11:37.640
Alfred will be thinking of battle
for the weeks to come.

11:38.400 --> 11:42.960
I want the Lady of Mercia found quickly.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.160
[Alfred] Father Pyrlig?

11:46.480 --> 11:47.680
Lord?

11:47.760 --> 11:51.080
You will draft and deliver a letter
to my son-in-law, Aethelred.

11:51.160 --> 11:54.320
You will recount the warning of an army
marching from the north,

11:54.400 --> 11:57.680
and you will inform him that, together,
we shall face this army...

11:58.320 --> 12:00.280
at Mercia's most favorable point.

12:00.920 --> 12:02.800
-This is to happen when?
-Immediately.

12:03.720 --> 12:05.000
We cannot wait.

12:06.080 --> 12:09.080
We shall confront them
and we shall defeat them.

12:10.720 --> 12:13.280
In the name of God
and the England yet to be.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.280
Yes, Lord.

12:21.280 --> 12:25.320
The King speaks and acts with authority,
as always.

12:27.640 --> 12:31.560
The King fears his strength shall fail him
all too soon.

12:32.520 --> 12:33.720
Never.

12:34.520 --> 12:36.240
God is great...

12:37.520 --> 12:38.520
as is Alfred.

12:39.400 --> 12:41.640
That is how you will be remembered.

12:48.480 --> 12:49.600
It is time.

12:53.400 --> 12:55.400
I will make no proclamations

12:55.480 --> 12:58.160
except everything is possible.

12:58.840 --> 13:03.880
I will say nothing more than it is time
to change these lands forever.

13:04.800 --> 13:08.160
It is time to begin a story

13:08.240 --> 13:12.560
that will be told amongst the living
and by those in Valhalla forever more.

13:13.120 --> 13:14.640
It will be our song

13:15.400 --> 13:16.640
and our story.

13:20.720 --> 13:21.880
Let it begin.

13:22.720 --> 13:23.840
Let's move out.

13:33.080 --> 13:34.080
[horses whinny]

13:54.640 --> 13:55.760
[indistinct chatter]

14:02.680 --> 14:05.160
My Lady is asking
if you've had enough to eat.

14:05.240 --> 14:08.720
I've told her yes, because the poor nuns
have been in the kitchen all day.

14:08.800 --> 14:10.800
How about a drop more ale for the night?

14:10.880 --> 14:13.600
Godric, you have a job to do,

14:13.680 --> 14:16.080
and you will need to be awake to do it.

14:17.360 --> 14:18.440
[men laughing]

14:18.520 --> 14:20.200
[Godric laughing]

14:21.360 --> 14:25.280
Abbess, may I ask,
how strong must a woman be

14:25.360 --> 14:28.200
-to live like this for all of her life?
-Strong?

14:28.280 --> 14:31.920
Yes. To deny yourself a life
outside of these walls.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.760
Lady, we wish to live like this,

14:34.840 --> 14:36.640
in the service of God.

14:37.400 --> 14:40.800
-I do not regret one day of my time here.
-[door opens]

14:40.880 --> 14:42.160
[nun] Abbess! Abbess,

14:42.240 --> 14:44.240
there are men in the kitchen. Danes.

14:44.320 --> 14:47.800
Close the doors!
Move the table against them. Quickly.

14:48.560 --> 14:51.040
-Why haven't the guards dealt with it?
-They will.

14:51.120 --> 14:53.480
Just as soon as they
become aware of the danger.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.280
-We should call to them.
-No!

14:55.360 --> 14:57.320
If it is thieves,
they may come and go.

14:57.400 --> 14:58.840
[sighs]

14:59.400 --> 15:00.760
-[banging at door]
-[gasps]

15:00.840 --> 15:02.320
[Aethelflaed shushing]

15:05.320 --> 15:07.800
-[banging at door continues]
-This is God's house.

15:07.880 --> 15:09.800
You will leave us this very moment.

15:10.440 --> 15:12.600
If you do not and you are Christian,

15:12.680 --> 15:14.880
then He will send you
to the depths of hell!

15:14.960 --> 15:17.320
Abbess, they are Danes.

15:18.360 --> 15:22.200
Well, then, if you are heathen,
He will strike you down!

15:23.440 --> 15:26.360
[Uhtred] What if I am a Christian
by birth and a Dane by my heart?

15:27.480 --> 15:28.520
What then?

15:28.600 --> 15:30.680
[exhales sharply] Uhtred.

15:30.760 --> 15:32.400
Do you think you know this man?

15:33.640 --> 15:34.800
[Aethelflaed] Yes.

15:36.160 --> 15:37.400
Yes, I do.

15:39.320 --> 15:41.800
Your guards are not, Lady.

15:41.880 --> 15:43.000
Not what?

15:43.080 --> 15:46.200
They're not guards.
Their swords are trinkets.

15:46.280 --> 15:47.400
-It's true.
-They're good men.

15:47.760 --> 15:50.640
I'm sure they're loyal,
but they are not guards.

15:50.720 --> 15:52.000
They are barely men.

15:52.720 --> 15:54.520
I do not like you, young man.

15:55.480 --> 15:57.880
You have a very high opinion of yourself.

15:59.440 --> 16:02.760
I am heathen, I am godless
and an enemy of Alfred...

16:03.640 --> 16:05.200
but I will keep you alive.

16:05.760 --> 16:09.720
-And who is it that wishes me dead?
-Several people, I imagine.

16:09.800 --> 16:12.960
What Uhtred is saying
is that the lands are changing.

16:13.480 --> 16:16.720
Men are becoming sick with greed
and we must all be on our guard.

16:16.800 --> 16:18.000
Well, perhaps.

16:19.800 --> 16:21.880
But I know when I'm hearing half-truths.

16:23.480 --> 16:25.080
I do not like him.

16:26.440 --> 16:28.800
[scoffs] I like her even less.

16:30.720 --> 16:31.760
Nor I you, hag.

16:34.080 --> 16:35.400
[Finan giggles]

16:36.520 --> 16:41.000
She reminds me of my mother,
and that woman was never wrong either.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.320
Cnut!

17:06.040 --> 17:07.040
Yes, Ragnar?

17:07.880 --> 17:10.200
Tomorrow, I want men sent on ahead.

17:10.280 --> 17:12.040
They're to watch for Alfred's army.

17:12.119 --> 17:13.280
So soon?

17:14.119 --> 17:17.280
He is no fool. He will not wait for us
to knock on his door.

17:17.680 --> 17:21.680
He'll want to choose the place of battle,
and we cannot allow him that advantage.

17:23.640 --> 17:26.680
We each volunteer a man,
you, me and Bloodhair.

17:28.800 --> 17:30.280
Yes, Lord.

17:31.640 --> 17:34.080
Will you speak to Bloodhair, or shall I?

17:34.160 --> 17:35.200
You.

17:57.360 --> 17:58.440
Ragnar belittles you.

18:00.880 --> 18:04.200
He is plowing a new field in the hope
of sowing the seed of another son.

18:05.400 --> 18:07.600
If you wish to sit with me,
you'll respect me.

18:07.680 --> 18:08.920
I respect you very much.

18:09.880 --> 18:12.280
Though I do not wish
to sit with you, Brida,

18:12.360 --> 18:13.440
I wish to lie with you.

18:14.000 --> 18:17.400
[chuckles] You should go while you
still have a tongue in your head.

18:17.480 --> 18:21.080
I like that you are proud,
and strong and loyal...

18:22.400 --> 18:23.760
and I will go now.

18:42.840 --> 18:44.200
Bloodhair.

18:45.200 --> 18:47.400
A private moment, Lord Sigurd?

18:54.240 --> 18:55.480
[exhales]

18:56.280 --> 19:00.240
[sighs] Ragnar requests that we each send
a spy on ahead to watch for Alfred.

19:00.800 --> 19:02.080
-That's fair.
-It is.

19:02.680 --> 19:04.640
What was not fair was Ragnar's decision

19:04.720 --> 19:08.080
to allow your fight with Uhtred
to proceed. That was an insult.

19:09.560 --> 19:10.760
Skade is yours.

19:11.640 --> 19:14.040
-Ragnar is your cousin.
-But this is war.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.960
Would I trust my sister in command
of my men because she is my sister?

19:18.800 --> 19:20.000
[chuckles]

19:24.240 --> 19:27.800
Our spies should also act as messengers.

19:28.400 --> 19:31.040
They should carry word of our intentions.

19:31.880 --> 19:35.400
Men will join us, you and me, good men.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.560
We should grow our armies together.

19:40.560 --> 19:41.600
Do you agree?

19:44.480 --> 19:45.840
I do not disagree.

19:47.800 --> 19:48.920
Then...

19:51.320 --> 19:52.760
that is enough.

19:58.600 --> 20:00.480
[Aethelflaed] I hoped you would come.

20:01.320 --> 20:04.080
I have released you from your oath,
you do know that?

20:06.160 --> 20:07.360
Beocca did say.

20:08.240 --> 20:09.400
And still you are here.

20:15.160 --> 20:17.200
I was broken to hear of Gisela's death.

20:20.080 --> 20:22.280
Your father allowed her
to be called a whore.

20:23.240 --> 20:24.400
I'm sorry for that.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.360
That was not your doing.

20:29.520 --> 20:31.680
The woman is still with you, I see.

20:31.760 --> 20:34.120
-Skade.
-She is my curse.

20:34.880 --> 20:36.440
My problem to resolve.

20:37.400 --> 20:40.400
-She is no longer a prisoner?
-She will not stray.

20:43.240 --> 20:44.920
You are carrying so much pain.

20:45.000 --> 20:48.200
Do not give your trust to a person
who does not deserve it,

20:48.720 --> 20:50.880
regardless of her guile and beauty.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.840
You are speaking of Skade still?

21:00.400 --> 21:03.240
It is not my business to ask,
but do you lie with her?

21:03.320 --> 21:04.560
I do not.

21:05.400 --> 21:06.680
She has a darkness.

21:06.760 --> 21:08.960
My immediate concern is your safety.

21:09.920 --> 21:12.040
You must return to Wessex, to your father.

21:12.120 --> 21:14.840
-I can't. I am of Mercia now--
-Aethelflaed, you must.

21:14.920 --> 21:17.040
Aethelred will soon know
that you're close.

21:17.120 --> 21:19.800
The real danger you will face
is from the Danes.

21:21.000 --> 21:24.000
They are marching as we speak,
a great army.

21:24.080 --> 21:25.480
Haesten is with them.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.400
He has not forgotten you,

21:29.040 --> 21:30.960
and I cannot protect you forever.

21:33.080 --> 21:34.840
I will not fight against the Danes.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.800
-Alfred must protect you now--
-Shh.

21:40.400 --> 21:43.600
You are here and I am glad of it.

21:44.880 --> 21:46.840
Soon I shall travel to my estate,

21:46.920 --> 21:49.880
and I shall face
both my husband and the Danes.

21:50.960 --> 21:51.800
I shall fight.

21:53.800 --> 21:55.080
I must...

21:56.480 --> 21:57.640
as my father must.

21:59.720 --> 22:01.680
-He, too, shall march.
-Aethelflaed--

22:06.200 --> 22:09.520
If you will excuse me, I promised
the Abbess I would pray with her.

22:10.800 --> 22:12.200
There is much to pray for.

22:19.960 --> 22:21.240
[exhales sharply]

22:29.720 --> 22:32.000
There should be no doubts
in your mind, Lord.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.240
Once you have fulfilled your promise
to the princess,

22:36.320 --> 22:39.120
you must return to your own path,
to the Danes.

22:40.800 --> 22:43.960
-And they would have me?
-They would need you, Uhtred Ragnarson.

22:44.560 --> 22:47.680
If that is who you are,
then you must return and you must lead.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.680
And you will need Skade, the seer,
to help you lead.

22:52.320 --> 22:54.680
It is not a seat I want.

22:56.000 --> 22:59.360
I have made my choice, Uhtred.
Now you must do the same.

23:00.400 --> 23:02.240
Make your life your own once more.

23:03.120 --> 23:05.320
Turn away from me,
and you and those you love

23:05.400 --> 23:07.480
shall be tormented till death and beyond.

23:36.800 --> 23:38.840
Lord Aethelhelm has arrived.

23:40.480 --> 23:41.960
A good choice, I feel.

23:42.800 --> 23:44.080
Yes.

23:44.160 --> 23:46.120
He has quite a gathering with him.

23:46.760 --> 23:48.640
Oh, he likes to show his feathers.

23:49.800 --> 23:52.400
But he has money and men,
both of which I will need.

23:53.160 --> 23:54.240
A perfect choice.

23:58.240 --> 24:00.040
He must not witness me sickly.

24:03.880 --> 24:05.200
[Beocca] Lord.

24:06.440 --> 24:09.720
On behalf of King Alfred
and Lady Aelswith, welcome to Winchester.

24:09.800 --> 24:13.280
-The King is with Edward--
-I do not recall your name.

24:13.360 --> 24:14.320
I am Beocca.

24:14.400 --> 24:16.880
Father Beocca, an adviser to the King.

24:16.960 --> 24:18.280
My rooms are in the palace?

24:18.760 --> 24:19.960
They are not, Lord.

24:20.680 --> 24:23.480
They are the most comfortable rooms
available at the inn.

24:23.560 --> 24:25.720
-An alehouse?
-Yes, Lord.

24:25.800 --> 24:30.880
And if my daughter were with me, would she
too be expected to rest in an alehouse?

24:30.960 --> 24:32.240
But she is not, Lord.

24:33.120 --> 24:34.320
The palace is under repair.

24:34.400 --> 24:37.920
In my experience,
Roman walls rarely need repair.

24:38.000 --> 24:41.520
You will inform Alfred I did expect a room
at the palace.

24:41.600 --> 24:45.000
I can find my own way to an alehouse,
Father. You are dismissed.

24:45.080 --> 24:46.160
Yes, Lord.

24:47.160 --> 24:49.720
-And may you choke on your oysters--
-What was that?

24:49.800 --> 24:51.040
The oysters, Lord.

24:51.600 --> 24:52.560
They are a delight.

24:56.240 --> 25:00.120
We are to march in one week, less perhaps.

25:00.720 --> 25:02.520
And I will have this matter settled.

25:05.160 --> 25:06.680
What do you say, Edward?

25:08.920 --> 25:10.680
I have looked to God as you asked,

25:11.560 --> 25:14.680
and it is before God
that I did swear my love.

25:14.760 --> 25:17.360
-I say I am married already.
-Then you shall unmarry!

25:17.440 --> 25:18.680
It is as simple as that.

25:18.760 --> 25:21.280
As you clearly lack the courage
to take this step--

25:21.360 --> 25:23.000
To remain married is honorable.

25:23.080 --> 25:24.640
Edward,
you'll say nothing more.

25:26.280 --> 25:27.200
Bishop Erkenwald?

25:28.480 --> 25:31.600
Lord, the girl in question has chosen
to enter a nunnery.

25:32.440 --> 25:35.960
-No, no. She has not, she would not--
-She has given herself to God...

25:36.040 --> 25:38.040
-That's not true!
-...so, the marriage,

25:38.120 --> 25:41.000
if it did exist at all, can be dismissed.

25:41.080 --> 25:42.600
I wish to see her. I wish to--

25:42.680 --> 25:45.720
What you wish, Edward,
is of no importance! None.

25:46.200 --> 25:49.080
The father of your match
has both wealth and men.

25:49.720 --> 25:52.680
-You will do your duty!
-I do not wish to do my--

25:52.760 --> 25:56.160
Do you believe that I wished
for my brother to be killed in battle...

25:57.440 --> 26:00.000
and for the crown to be
placed upon my head?

26:02.480 --> 26:03.680
I did not.

26:05.880 --> 26:10.040
But I soon realized that as well
as it being a burden, it is a privilege

26:11.480 --> 26:12.920
to lead our people.

26:14.360 --> 26:17.400
The crown of Wessex is all-important.

26:17.480 --> 26:21.560
Wessex and England are all-important.

26:21.640 --> 26:23.520
Matters of the heart are not.

26:24.160 --> 26:27.040
She would not have entered
a nunnery by choice.

26:27.120 --> 26:29.400
Unless she cares more
for her God and country

26:29.480 --> 26:30.640
than for
the King's son.

26:33.160 --> 26:34.560
You are to be betrothed.

26:36.000 --> 26:39.160
And in good time,
you shall marry Aelflaed.

26:40.800 --> 26:43.480
Father Pyrlig, the holy relics.
My son will now swear.

26:43.880 --> 26:46.800
Saint Cuthbert's teeth, Lord,
or something kinder?

26:46.880 --> 26:48.840
The teeth are appropriate, Father.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.080
What of my children?

26:52.400 --> 26:56.160
-The children will be cared for.
-But not by their mother.

26:56.760 --> 27:00.080
Of course not by their mother.
She now belongs to God.

27:00.160 --> 27:01.960
[Alfred] The children will thrive...

27:02.640 --> 27:06.200
but first there is a bargain to be made
and a battle to be won.

27:06.320 --> 27:09.240
If the battle is not won,
the children shall become slaves,

27:09.320 --> 27:11.520
and their mother, a Viking's whore.

27:13.160 --> 27:16.120
The crown is all-important.

27:18.400 --> 27:19.720
Do you understand?

27:22.600 --> 27:23.760
I... I do.

27:48.800 --> 27:51.400
We go slowly and we rest often.

27:51.480 --> 27:55.080
To remain strong.
The battle cannot begin without us.

27:55.160 --> 27:56.480
That is true.

27:58.160 --> 28:01.560
I would like to ask
in all seriousness and confidence...

28:01.640 --> 28:02.960
Do I have your confidence?

28:04.000 --> 28:05.720
Of course. Speak freely.

28:07.400 --> 28:11.720
In confidence, then, I ask,
is Ragnar the man to lead our army?

28:12.880 --> 28:14.920
Uhtred did suggest him,
but Uhtred is gone.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.080
-Uhtred has betrayed us.
-My point exactly.

28:18.040 --> 28:21.640
So is your cousin the man
to lead our army?

28:24.400 --> 28:27.400
Cnut, I was...
I was talking friend-to-friend,

28:27.480 --> 28:30.640
nothing more than hypothesizing.

28:32.320 --> 28:36.600
I do not know what that word means,
but I will say this in confidence.

28:37.280 --> 28:38.800
Ragnar is a good man.

28:38.880 --> 28:41.720
His father, the Fearless,
was a better man.

28:41.800 --> 28:44.480
Ragnar's whole purpose in life
has been to avenge him.

28:44.560 --> 28:46.680
He did that by killing Kjartan.
I was there.

28:46.760 --> 28:48.160
Which he has done, yes.

28:48.240 --> 28:51.200
Hence, no more purpose.

28:52.560 --> 28:56.000
Once again, I find it difficult to
disagree with you, Aethelwold.

28:56.520 --> 28:57.960
Ragnar is spent.

28:58.840 --> 29:00.960
That said, he will kill you.

29:02.480 --> 29:05.160
-What? Why?
-He blames you for losing Uhtred.

29:05.880 --> 29:09.920
-Why? I merely opened his eyes.
-And he will close yours, for all time.

29:11.640 --> 29:15.160
I like you, Aethelwold,
but Ragnar will kill you.

29:15.680 --> 29:16.760
Soon.

29:30.480 --> 29:32.000
[babies cooing]

29:33.800 --> 29:34.960
[door opening]

29:36.640 --> 29:39.840
In the name of Alfred, King of Wessex,
I'm taking these children.

29:39.920 --> 29:42.320
-No. You can't!
-They'll become church property

29:42.400 --> 29:44.800
and dedicate their lives
to the worship of God.

29:44.880 --> 29:45.840
[babies crying]

29:46.640 --> 29:47.800
You are Ecgwynn?

29:47.880 --> 29:49.640
-She is.
-Yes.

29:49.720 --> 29:51.280
You are required in Winchester.

29:58.320 --> 30:00.240
He will ask of his precious daughter.

30:00.320 --> 30:02.640
And you can tell him Aethelflaed is well.

30:06.320 --> 30:10.400
Lord, if a Dane army is fast approaching,
then there is only one path to take.

30:11.360 --> 30:12.200
To join Alfred.

30:12.880 --> 30:17.040
To join him and to preserve Mercia.

30:18.160 --> 30:19.480
[sighs]

30:20.880 --> 30:23.080
Then we shall fight, Aldhelm.

30:25.360 --> 30:28.160
And with luck, the right people shall die.

30:29.480 --> 30:31.280
[indistinct chatter]

30:34.320 --> 30:36.320
[men laughing]

30:37.840 --> 30:42.240
Ugh. They are ravenous, permanently.
Take them through.

30:42.840 --> 30:46.960
They're eating into our winter store
and belching it out into the air.

30:48.600 --> 30:49.800
Right.

30:50.560 --> 30:53.520
There you are. There.

30:53.600 --> 30:56.120
Hey, there.

30:56.200 --> 30:58.920
-[pigs squeal]
-That'll fatten you up nicely, hey?

30:59.760 --> 31:00.720
Good girls.

31:02.840 --> 31:04.240
[Haesten] Good morning, nun!

31:06.160 --> 31:07.440
I am an abbess.

31:07.520 --> 31:09.600
[chuckles] I don't care.

31:10.600 --> 31:11.960
[hostages gasping]

31:16.800 --> 31:17.840
We will wait...

31:19.200 --> 31:20.440
for Aethelflaed!

31:22.080 --> 31:24.720
To the hall, all of you, quickly, now!

31:26.920 --> 31:27.800
That's it.

31:29.320 --> 31:30.480
Come on.

31:37.560 --> 31:39.600
-[Uhtred] What is it?
-Abbess?

31:39.680 --> 31:41.240
Danes. Outside.

31:41.320 --> 31:43.960
-[all clamoring]
-I just witnessed them kill a man.

31:44.040 --> 31:46.440
-How many Danes?
-I did not count them, but many.

31:46.520 --> 31:47.720
Why aren't they bursting in?

31:47.800 --> 31:51.160
Finan, hold. Sihtric.
They may not know we're here.

31:51.240 --> 31:54.760
-They have asked for the lady Aethelflaed.
-They know someone is here.

31:55.320 --> 31:57.080
There are two other hostages.

31:57.160 --> 31:59.640
We wait inside and will remain silent.

31:59.720 --> 32:02.000
Abbess, you will go to them
and talk to them.

32:02.080 --> 32:04.240
No, no, I... I... I will not.

32:04.320 --> 32:05.760
You will, because you must.

32:05.840 --> 32:09.640
-[sobs] Did I not say I do not like you?
-You did.

32:09.720 --> 32:13.240
Allow them to believe you are unprotected
and deny Aethelflaed is here.

32:13.320 --> 32:17.040
-And we will do what, hide?
-We will make an advantage out of this.

32:17.120 --> 32:19.920
Abbess, the hostages they have
are dead men breathing.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.320
You cannot save them.

32:22.680 --> 32:25.680
What we must do now is save the lives
of your nuns and my men.

32:25.760 --> 32:28.160
-And Aethelflaed.
-Abbess?

32:29.320 --> 32:31.080
-Aye.
-I will do it.

32:31.960 --> 32:33.120
No.

32:34.160 --> 32:38.320
No. This is my house,
it's my responsibility.

32:40.400 --> 32:42.360
I will do it. [breathing shakily]

32:46.640 --> 32:47.800
[sighs]

32:52.600 --> 32:55.800
It is Haesten, with no more than 40 men.

32:55.880 --> 32:57.400
Forty that I can see.

32:57.480 --> 32:59.560
-Then let us fight them.
-No, wait.

33:04.720 --> 33:05.920
What is it you want?

33:07.160 --> 33:11.000
We have some food and some ale,
it is yours.

33:11.560 --> 33:14.080
What we do not have is silver.

33:14.880 --> 33:17.760
If it is ourselves you want, our lives...

33:19.160 --> 33:20.920
I ask you, why?

33:22.080 --> 33:23.040
Aethelflaed!

33:24.000 --> 33:26.480
Aethelflaed, Aethelflaed, Aethelflaed...

33:26.560 --> 33:30.520
How many times
do I have to say that stupid name?

33:30.600 --> 33:34.120
What I want is Aethelflaed!

33:35.600 --> 33:36.800
Give her to me now...

33:37.720 --> 33:39.440
or this man dies.

33:39.520 --> 33:42.080
[hostage sobbing] No! No, no!

33:42.160 --> 33:44.760
There is no one in this house
called Aethelflaed.

33:44.840 --> 33:45.880
[gasping]

33:46.720 --> 33:47.880
-[groans]
-[gasps]

33:51.240 --> 33:55.360
Deny her presence once more
and a third man dies.

33:55.440 --> 34:00.240
And I will burn down your nunnery
and everyone inside.

34:01.480 --> 34:02.560
Release him.

34:03.560 --> 34:06.160
Release him and take me
in his place. [sniffles]

34:06.880 --> 34:09.000
Or am I too strong for you?

34:09.840 --> 34:11.520
[shuddering]

34:11.600 --> 34:13.280
-[hostage choking]
-[gasping]

34:16.120 --> 34:18.000
Why must you behave like this?

34:18.800 --> 34:21.400
Why must you slaughter for no good reason?

34:21.480 --> 34:23.800
[clears throat] Dagfinn.

34:25.560 --> 34:28.679
-Aethelflaed.
-Why must blood be spilled?

34:29.400 --> 34:31.040
It is heathen!

34:31.120 --> 34:32.480
Ungodly!

34:33.000 --> 34:36.480
And you are the devil's incarnation,
nothing more!

34:36.560 --> 34:37.560
[panting]

34:38.880 --> 34:42.639
And all I can try and do is ensure that

34:42.719 --> 34:44.960
-He shall have you.
-[grunts]

34:45.600 --> 34:47.320
[groaning]

34:47.400 --> 34:48.360
[gasps]

34:50.840 --> 34:52.320
[clears throat]

34:52.400 --> 34:56.000
Could you not just have taken
the ax from her hand?

34:57.880 --> 34:59.160
[Finan] Lord, now?

35:00.320 --> 35:03.080
We do nothing... yet.

35:03.680 --> 35:04.800
[Haesten] Aethelflaed!

35:05.360 --> 35:09.560
Enough men and women have died
to save your bony arse...

35:10.200 --> 35:13.160
at Beamfleot and now here.

35:15.080 --> 35:18.720
Did my lord Erik
not give his life for you?

35:18.800 --> 35:20.480
How many more must do the same?

35:21.720 --> 35:22.720
Show yourself!

35:22.800 --> 35:24.520
[horse whinnies]

35:24.600 --> 35:26.120
There are many horses at the stable.

35:27.720 --> 35:29.560
Why have her other men
not shown themselves?

35:30.160 --> 35:32.320
Because like the men we just killed,

35:33.560 --> 35:35.640
they are busy filling their breeches.

35:36.200 --> 35:37.560
Aethelflaed!

35:39.560 --> 35:40.840
She's here!

36:16.800 --> 36:18.040
[all shouting]

36:25.600 --> 36:27.080
-[bone crunching]
-[screaming]

36:30.360 --> 36:31.480
[both groan]

36:33.200 --> 36:34.200
[screaming]

36:38.040 --> 36:39.200
[groans]

36:42.720 --> 36:44.200
[grunting]

36:52.880 --> 36:54.080
-[groaning]
-That's it.

37:10.880 --> 37:12.640
-It was Uhtred!
-I saw who it was.

37:12.720 --> 37:15.120
-Why is he not in the north?
-Because he is here!

37:18.640 --> 37:21.800
We block every entrance,
but not the main doors.

37:22.480 --> 37:23.640
And we wait!

37:29.240 --> 37:30.240
We are trapped.

37:31.200 --> 37:32.440
We're alive...

37:33.520 --> 37:35.480
and they are 12 or 13 men less.

37:36.080 --> 37:38.880
But we are trapped under a wooden roof.

37:38.960 --> 37:40.640
What do you suggest then, Lady?

37:41.280 --> 37:43.320
-That you give yourself over?
-Yes.

37:44.080 --> 37:47.040
Haesten's right. Why should I live
when so many others have died?

37:47.120 --> 37:50.040
Haesten has never
spoken the truth in his life!

37:50.120 --> 37:51.640
Do not say as much again. Never.

37:52.400 --> 37:54.280
Or those men have died for no reason.

38:03.720 --> 38:06.520
Your men have arrived
at the River Ouse, I'm told.

38:06.600 --> 38:07.720
That was the message.

38:08.520 --> 38:09.440
That is good news.

38:11.600 --> 38:14.000
We will rise early tomorrow
and quicken our pace.

38:15.320 --> 38:16.640
Why expend our strength?

38:19.080 --> 38:21.080
The first battle is always in the mind.

38:21.920 --> 38:23.200
Alfred'll have his spies.

38:23.280 --> 38:26.200
When they see us,
I want Bloodhair's men alongside with us.

38:26.880 --> 38:30.080
I want us to be a swarm, one army.

38:33.960 --> 38:36.160
Then we will rise early
and quicken our pace.

38:36.920 --> 38:37.920
What of Haesten?

38:38.000 --> 38:41.040
I expect him to keep his word
and protect us from the east,

38:41.120 --> 38:42.720
attack from the east.

38:49.480 --> 38:51.680
Only when we have sight
of the enemy in battlefield

38:51.760 --> 38:54.000
can we discuss exactly how we fight.

38:54.080 --> 38:55.120
[Cnut] Agreed.

38:58.160 --> 39:00.240
Are you away to sow another seed, cousin?

39:00.320 --> 39:03.000
-I'm away to my bed, Cnut.
-Alone?

39:11.560 --> 39:12.560
[Brida] Ragnar.

39:14.400 --> 39:15.240
Again?

39:17.800 --> 39:18.800
Yes.

39:20.440 --> 39:22.600
It's the last time, I promise.

39:25.920 --> 39:26.880
One more son.

39:28.000 --> 39:28.840
I swear.

39:30.200 --> 39:31.560
If it's not, I'll take your cock.

39:41.720 --> 39:42.800
I swear.

40:00.640 --> 40:02.200
Aethelwold, my friend.

40:04.480 --> 40:05.600
How are you?

40:06.160 --> 40:08.200
Alive still, which is good. [chuckles]

40:11.160 --> 40:13.160
I have been thinking on what you said...

40:14.480 --> 40:16.960
about Ragnar and the likelihood
of him killing me.

40:18.560 --> 40:19.400
Soon.

40:19.480 --> 40:21.840
Yes, soon. Thank you for reminding me.

40:24.160 --> 40:25.280
[Cnut sighs]

40:25.360 --> 40:26.880
I was thinking that perhaps...

40:29.280 --> 40:30.560
I should kill him first.

40:34.160 --> 40:35.440
Is that a plan at all?

40:38.920 --> 40:41.240
At least you are not laughing
at the idea. [inhales]

40:42.880 --> 40:43.920
How?

40:45.960 --> 40:46.960
How would you kill him?

40:47.040 --> 40:49.400
In his sleep.
I'm not gonna fight him.

40:49.480 --> 40:51.920
-When?
-Soon.

40:53.920 --> 40:55.920
Sooner than he kills me. [laughs]

40:57.200 --> 40:59.040
-Tonight?
-Tonight?

41:00.800 --> 41:02.760
I don't know,
the idea's only just come to me.

41:02.840 --> 41:03.920
It should be tonight.

41:05.760 --> 41:06.920
Tomorrow we quicken our pace.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.480
Tomorrow we begin to think about
the battle ahead.

41:09.560 --> 41:13.160
Tomorrow, Ragnar will become
a different man.

41:18.160 --> 41:19.360
Once it is done...

41:22.240 --> 41:25.080
you will have my protection, friend.

41:33.120 --> 41:34.320
Very well.

41:36.320 --> 41:37.480
Tonight.

41:48.000 --> 41:49.720
-The ale is good.
-Yeah, it is.

41:49.800 --> 41:50.840
Very good.

41:53.040 --> 41:55.280
To the creators of fine ale!

41:55.360 --> 41:56.560
[indistinct chatter]

41:56.640 --> 41:59.000
May God... bless them.

42:00.240 --> 42:03.840
May the gods bless them. Him.

42:15.600 --> 42:18.480
All doors have been blocked
on the outside apart from that one.

42:18.560 --> 42:19.840
Will they set a fire?

42:20.520 --> 42:22.240
Not yet. He will want you alive.

42:22.320 --> 42:25.200
We should fight, Lord.
We should open the doors and fight.

42:25.280 --> 42:27.160
-And die?
-It's as good a plan as any.

42:27.240 --> 42:29.840
Osferth, you'll open the door
on my word and retreat.

42:29.920 --> 42:33.040
We form a shield wall
and then we negotiate.

42:33.600 --> 42:34.880
Negotiate?

42:34.960 --> 42:36.480
Haesten will want his prize.

42:37.200 --> 42:38.360
To the door!

42:40.800 --> 42:42.440
If you truly belong to me...

42:44.360 --> 42:45.720
you will do as I ask.

42:46.640 --> 42:47.640
In return,

42:48.320 --> 42:49.760
I will not abandon you.

42:49.840 --> 42:51.000
I will come for you.

42:56.600 --> 42:59.000
-You're choosing her over me?
-I am keeping us alive.

42:59.080 --> 43:01.400
-By making me a prize.
-I will not abandon you.

43:04.520 --> 43:05.840
I will lie with you.

43:09.240 --> 43:11.560
You shall remain cursed
until your word is made true.

43:12.640 --> 43:15.480
Your life shall wither, Uhtred,
until you find me.

43:16.000 --> 43:17.000
And I will find you.

43:18.800 --> 43:19.800
Shield wall ready!

43:23.720 --> 43:24.960
[wood clattering]

43:26.160 --> 43:28.920
Lord, there is something happening.

43:29.800 --> 43:31.480
Every man at the ready.

43:32.040 --> 43:33.160
Every sword!

43:35.640 --> 43:37.600
Lift the bar and open the door.

43:43.240 --> 43:44.400
Move!

43:44.480 --> 43:46.160
[men grunting]

43:49.400 --> 43:52.240
I count a few more than thirty
of the bastards.

43:52.320 --> 43:54.640
Fight, Haesten, and you will lose men.

43:54.720 --> 43:57.720
-Many men, I guarantee it.
-I have many men.

43:58.280 --> 44:00.440
[Finan] But you have just the one life!

44:01.280 --> 44:02.440
And I plan to take it.

44:03.640 --> 44:04.840
Move out!

44:04.920 --> 44:06.120
[men grunting]

44:09.680 --> 44:12.080
-[screaming]
-Dagfinn! Easy, easy!

44:12.160 --> 44:13.360
[men grunting]

44:23.080 --> 44:25.160
I will not leave without her, Uhtred.

44:26.040 --> 44:29.280
I may lose men,
but you will lose everything,

44:29.360 --> 44:31.480
and the bitch will still be mine.

44:31.560 --> 44:35.920
Then take her,
because that is what you will have to do.

44:37.400 --> 44:38.800
Or we can strike a bargain.

44:39.360 --> 44:41.360
One woman in place of another.

44:42.080 --> 44:44.000
I am in no need of a nun.

44:45.440 --> 44:48.120
-Who is this woman?
-Skade. The seer.

44:50.400 --> 44:51.240
Finan.

44:57.480 --> 44:58.840
She is yours.

44:58.920 --> 45:01.640
In return, you and your men
ride clear of this place

45:01.720 --> 45:02.880
and do not return.

45:02.960 --> 45:04.520
She is not yours to give.

45:05.280 --> 45:08.080
-She belongs to Bloodhair.
-I belong to the man I choose.

45:09.000 --> 45:11.800
The man who has the will to lead,
to conquer.

45:11.880 --> 45:13.640
Bloodhair is not that man.

45:14.480 --> 45:17.720
[Uhtred] She has seen Alfred's death...
and in battle.

45:18.480 --> 45:21.400
Her man will benefit
from that death, greatly.

45:23.000 --> 45:24.000
Is this true?

45:26.320 --> 45:27.360
It's true.

45:30.720 --> 45:31.600
May I approach?

45:32.400 --> 45:36.600
Uhtred, you cannot bargain
with this sack of chicken shit.

45:40.160 --> 45:41.440
You're close enough.

45:43.640 --> 45:47.320
If a bargain is made, I will not be
handed over like you would a whore.

45:47.400 --> 45:49.240
I will walk to my new Lord.

45:50.000 --> 45:52.200
And should either man go back on his word,

45:52.280 --> 45:54.480
I shall see he is tormented till the end.

45:55.480 --> 45:56.640
I swear.

45:57.960 --> 46:01.320
Do we have an agreement?
Skade in place of Aethelflaed?

46:06.320 --> 46:08.880
[smacks lips] Agreed.

46:08.960 --> 46:10.160
The seer is mine.

46:10.800 --> 46:12.880
Then step back and she will walk to you.

46:12.960 --> 46:15.120
-And then you leave.
-I will.

46:20.640 --> 46:24.160
And you are cursed once more,
Uhtred of Bebbanburg.

46:25.800 --> 46:26.880
You shall wither!

46:28.640 --> 46:29.640
Go.

46:31.680 --> 46:33.160
Open, let her pass.

46:42.560 --> 46:45.720
This does not mean the princess
is forgiven, Uhtred.

46:46.600 --> 46:48.800
She is safe for now, no more than that.

46:48.880 --> 46:50.720
Leave. Go.

47:03.320 --> 47:05.320
Your life is not your own, Lord.

47:15.280 --> 47:16.280
Lord.

47:17.400 --> 47:18.480
Aethelhelm.

47:19.320 --> 47:20.680
How good of you to join me.

47:21.480 --> 47:24.520
I thought it fitting that
our first meeting should be at prayers.

47:25.360 --> 47:28.480
My Lord King, it's an honor to be asked.

47:29.600 --> 47:31.680
And this, if I am not mistaken,
must be Edward?

47:31.760 --> 47:32.800
Lord.

47:33.560 --> 47:35.800
I too am happy to see you
here at Winchester.

47:38.720 --> 47:40.880
I look forward to meeting
your daughter, Aelflaed,

47:40.960 --> 47:43.440
but only at a time that you think fit,
of course.

47:44.040 --> 47:45.360
[chuckles dryly] Charming.

47:45.440 --> 47:48.480
Aethelhelm, I shall bring you
into my confidence immediately.

47:48.560 --> 47:49.840
War is coming.

47:50.640 --> 47:52.240
Your lands are under threat.

47:53.360 --> 47:56.080
Danes are marching in numbers
from north to south.

47:57.000 --> 48:00.480
Let us pray for the strength and fortitude
to defeat them once again.

48:03.640 --> 48:04.760
Join me.

48:13.200 --> 48:14.760
[indistinct chatter]

48:14.840 --> 48:16.240
[urinating]

48:16.320 --> 48:17.440
[sighs]

48:19.640 --> 48:21.720
[Aethelwold] I am... to my bed.

48:27.960 --> 48:30.440
Good night! Good night!

48:36.440 --> 48:37.760
[sighs]

49:11.720 --> 49:15.520
[voice whispering indistinctly]

49:30.640 --> 49:31.880
[panting]

50:13.680 --> 50:15.600
[breathing heavily]

50:27.640 --> 50:29.120
[grunting]

50:31.080 --> 50:32.560
[grunting]

50:36.640 --> 50:37.680
[yelling]

50:42.920 --> 50:43.880
[Ragnar chokes]

50:45.080 --> 50:46.240
[panting]

51:22.040 --> 51:22.960
[grunts]
