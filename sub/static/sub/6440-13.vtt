00:04.988 --> 00:07.320
Hold nothing back!
Leave it all on the floor!

00:07.490 --> 00:10.425
- How much time we got?
- We've got fifteen minutes tops!

00:10.593 --> 00:12.424
Just enough time to get in and out!

00:13.430 --> 00:15.421
All right, let's do this thing!

00:31.114 --> 00:32.809
Are you ready now, Clark?

00:32.983 --> 00:35.611
Yeah. I forgot to press
the record button. Sorry.

00:36.486 --> 00:38.351
So, Mr. Luthor...

00:38.521 --> 00:41.820
...any more secret construction
projects at LuthorCorp like Level 3?

00:42.025 --> 00:43.652
Please, call me Lex.

00:44.194 --> 00:46.662
- Lex, are you gonna answer my question?
- Chloe.

00:46.830 --> 00:49.594
- What?
- It's okay, Clark.

00:49.766 --> 00:52.326
"Our critics are our friends.
They show us our faults."

00:52.936 --> 00:55.370
Benjamin Franklin.

00:55.939 --> 00:57.497
Excuse me, Mr. Luthor...

00:57.674 --> 01:00.700
- ... your father's on the phone.
- I need to get this.

01:02.178 --> 01:05.113
I'll take it in the conservatory.

01:06.016 --> 01:09.315
I look forward to resuming
our verbal judo.

01:17.460 --> 01:20.793
- All right, boys, this is the big one!
- Yeah! Let's do it!

01:20.964 --> 01:22.795
Let's go!

01:22.966 --> 01:26.925
I wonder if he's really taking a call
or if he's just trying to avoid me?

01:27.103 --> 01:29.367
Wow, that's really cool.

01:29.572 --> 01:31.870
Do you think it's real?

01:36.946 --> 01:39.073
Chloe?

01:40.683 --> 01:42.810
Chloe.

01:50.093 --> 01:52.653
Okay. The vault's in the wall
behind the bookcase.

01:52.829 --> 01:55.525
- How do you know?
- I've got my sources.

01:55.698 --> 01:59.532
- He was doing one of the housekeepers.
- Oh, yeah.

02:19.923 --> 02:22.448
- We got five minutes, let's move it!
- Let's do it!

02:23.693 --> 02:27.151
That's it, boys, come on. It's payday!

02:38.541 --> 02:41.032
One minute!

02:42.245 --> 02:45.146
- Come on, let's go!
- I only got one arm.

02:45.915 --> 02:48.110
Yeah!

02:49.619 --> 02:52.645
Time's up! Let's move it! Let's go!

02:53.156 --> 02:55.556
You can't just go snooping
around someone's house.

02:55.725 --> 02:59.889
Clark, it's a mansion.
It's designed for snooping.

03:00.230 --> 03:02.721
Okay, fine.
We'll go and wait in the library...

03:02.899 --> 03:06.357
...for Lex to officially blow us off.

03:06.903 --> 03:10.532
- I'll put the camera away.
- Okay, I'm gonna go get my bag.

03:13.776 --> 03:15.744
Hey, what's going on?

03:19.516 --> 03:21.006
Chloe, run!

03:46.376 --> 03:49.140
Move it! Let's move it!

03:50.013 --> 03:51.002
Clark!

03:52.015 --> 03:53.380
Chloe.

03:53.550 --> 03:55.484
Clark!

04:05.328 --> 04:06.352
Chloe!

05:19.035 --> 05:21.629
Clark.

05:24.840 --> 05:28.139
Don't worry, I brought in
the best doctors from Metropolis.

05:28.310 --> 05:31.939
- Is she gonna be all right?
- Doctors aren't sure.

05:32.114 --> 05:36.210
The fall was pretty bad. She broke
her left arm and has a concussion.

05:36.752 --> 05:39.118
They wanna make sure
there's no brain swelling.

05:39.288 --> 05:41.916
I should've gotten to her.

05:42.091 --> 05:45.857
I don't mean to belabor the obvious,
Clark, but this isn't your fault.

05:46.028 --> 05:49.759
I just don't know what happened.
One minute, the room is empty...

05:49.932 --> 05:52.162
...and then they appear out of thin air.

05:52.334 --> 05:54.928
I mean, do the police have any leads?

05:55.104 --> 05:57.572
They don't think I'm the first one
that's been hit.

05:57.740 --> 06:00.641
There have been over a dozen
robberies all over the county.

06:04.346 --> 06:06.576
They tried to hit the
Smallville Savings & Loan.

06:07.216 --> 06:09.377
I didn't hear about that.

06:09.552 --> 06:12.885
Banks don't publicize attempted robberies,
it's bad for their image.

06:13.589 --> 06:16.183
If nothing was taken,
how do they know they were robbed?

06:16.358 --> 06:18.758
Apparently they tripped an alarm
inside the vault.

06:18.928 --> 06:21.624
Although, no one knows
how they got in there.

06:21.931 --> 06:25.025
And the stuff they stole from you.
Can the police trace it?

06:25.201 --> 06:28.193
I didn't report anything stolen, Clark.

06:29.472 --> 06:33.738
- Why not? I saw them walk out with bags.
- I don't care about that.

06:33.909 --> 06:37.072
I just want to find the people
who did this to Chloe. When I do...

06:37.246 --> 06:40.306
...I promise you,
they will be dealt with accordingly.

06:40.483 --> 06:44.283
- What does that mean?
- It means you should let me worry about it.

06:44.453 --> 06:47.889
Now, why don't you go home
and get some rest?

07:07.042 --> 07:08.805
Whitney.

07:08.978 --> 07:11.276
Hey, Whitney, wait up.

07:11.447 --> 07:15.884
- Thought you're meeting me at the hospital.
- I'm sorry, I forgot. How's Chloe?

07:16.051 --> 07:18.019
Better, but not out of the woods yet.

07:18.187 --> 07:21.816
That's the thing with this town.
It'll always find a way to keep you down.

07:21.991 --> 07:25.757
Whitney, what's wrong? Is it your dad?

07:25.995 --> 07:29.362
No, it's nothing.
I've just got to go do inventory.

07:29.532 --> 07:31.659
See you.

07:50.886 --> 07:52.717
Hi, Clark. What are you doing?

07:53.689 --> 07:57.022
- Trying to make myself useful.
- Hey, son...

07:57.193 --> 07:59.354
...we need firewood, not toothpicks.

08:00.329 --> 08:03.355
I know what you guys are gonna say:
It's not my fault.

08:03.532 --> 08:07.832
- Lex already told me, so did Chloe's dad.
- They're right, Clark. You did your best.

08:08.003 --> 08:10.130
- Chloe could've died.
- Son...

08:10.306 --> 08:12.740
...becoming an adult means
learning difficult lessons...

08:12.908 --> 08:16.969
...one of which is you can't save
everybody, no matter who you are.

08:17.146 --> 08:19.341
You said you felt the effects
of the meteor rocks.

08:19.515 --> 08:22.814
Yeah, I just don't know
where it was coming from.

08:23.285 --> 08:27.346
Sometimes I just wish I could leave this
town and get away from the meteor rocks.

08:28.991 --> 08:32.017
I'm sure that you will.
You'll get that chance.

08:32.193 --> 08:34.525
But running away won't solve anything.

08:34.663 --> 08:37.496
Don't hang around here
feeling sorry for yourself.

08:37.666 --> 08:40.828
Go. See what you can find out.

08:59.221 --> 09:03.055
I had no idea I stored
so much stuff in here.

09:03.225 --> 09:06.854
- Will you hand me the tape, please?
- Yeah.

09:07.429 --> 09:10.523
I still can't believe
you're selling this place, Nell.

09:10.699 --> 09:13.759
I can't believe your sudden interest
in the place.

09:14.003 --> 09:16.938
My parents met here.
This place means a lot to me.

09:17.106 --> 09:18.869
I know, Lana...

09:19.041 --> 09:23.068
...but one screen can't compete
with a multiplex. And the fact is...

09:23.245 --> 09:27.045
...I wanna be able
to send you to any college you want.

09:31.787 --> 09:33.846
Could you tell me who the buyer is?

09:34.023 --> 09:37.686
Maybe I could talk to them.
See if they'd be willing to renovate.

09:39.795 --> 09:42.355
It's Lex Luthor.

09:46.302 --> 09:49.760
Lex said the people who hit the
mansion tried to rob this bank.

09:49.939 --> 09:52.840
I've got three words for you:
official police investigation.

09:53.008 --> 09:55.033
The police haven't done a thing.

09:55.210 --> 09:58.941
There have been 12 robberies in the past
six months with the same freaky m. o.

09:59.114 --> 10:01.912
No sign of entry, the jewels
and the cash just vanished.

10:02.084 --> 10:06.020
Except for this place. Lex says that
they triggered an alarm inside the vault.

10:06.188 --> 10:09.954
- The question is, how'd they get inside?
- I don't know.

10:10.125 --> 10:13.322
Now, stop channeling Chloe and come on.

10:23.172 --> 10:26.232
Oh, no, not the Kent thousand-yard stare.

10:26.408 --> 10:28.467
Clark! Come on, man.

10:29.111 --> 10:32.137
I know you feel bad. I do too.

10:32.314 --> 10:34.874
But we're not cops.

10:59.341 --> 11:01.605
Nothing. Nada.

11:01.777 --> 11:06.077
Not a single sidebar. A guy has got to miss
a hundred grand in cash and jewels.

11:06.582 --> 11:08.413
Not Luthor, bro.

11:08.984 --> 11:12.681
There is no telling how much
jack he's got stashed in that castle.

11:12.855 --> 11:15.551
Cash, jewels, art, cars, you name it!

11:15.724 --> 11:19.490
If we went downstairs, we would've found
the money pit where he swims in the stuff...

11:19.661 --> 11:22.562
- ... like that duck with the Irish accent.
- Uncle Scrooge.

11:22.731 --> 11:26.531
- Yeah, yeah.
- He was Scottish, not Irish.

11:28.370 --> 11:33.000
We don't have enough time. This stuff
doesn't last as long as it used to.

11:33.475 --> 11:36.000
I know, I know.

11:36.178 --> 11:38.408
I'm telling you, we need fresh blood.

11:38.580 --> 11:42.072
- Yeah, but who can we trust?
- I don't know.

11:42.718 --> 11:46.017
I think I know why Luthor
didn't file that robbery report.

11:46.622 --> 11:49.147
Check this out.

11:50.793 --> 11:55.253
The poster boy for Rogaine doesn't want
anyone to know he's tapped into...

11:57.232 --> 11:58.961
...his daddy's computer system.

11:59.134 --> 12:01.932
Maybe then we pay Luthor Junior
another visit, huh?

12:02.104 --> 12:04.766
I think so.

12:08.844 --> 12:11.369
I don't care.

12:11.680 --> 12:14.240
If I wanted excuses, I'd call the police.

12:15.250 --> 12:21.018
Yeah? Well, you're supposed to be the
best private security firm in Metropolis.

12:23.392 --> 12:25.792
How'd you get in here?

12:25.961 --> 12:29.294
The same way we did last time, bro.

12:32.634 --> 12:37.003
- I'm calling the police.
- You didn't last time, and we know why.

12:37.539 --> 12:40.599
We read the disk, Lex.

12:41.643 --> 12:44.612
- What are you talking about?
- You're skimming money from your dad...

12:44.780 --> 12:47.408
...to fund a project in Smallville.

12:47.583 --> 12:51.417
That concerns a methane treatment plant.
It'll put our competitors out of business.

12:56.125 --> 12:59.117
Methane plants don't need
particle accelerators.

12:59.294 --> 13:02.752
- What do you want?
- A million, cash.

13:04.533 --> 13:07.969
If you try anything stupid,
even if you think a stupid thought...

13:08.137 --> 13:10.469
...your disk is going to be uploaded
to the Internet...

13:10.639 --> 13:15.201
...for all the world
and Big Daddy Lionel to see.

13:15.377 --> 13:16.844
How do I reach you?

13:17.012 --> 13:19.674
You don't. We reach you.

13:22.885 --> 13:24.546
Now, turn around.

13:28.123 --> 13:30.523
Wait there.

13:30.859 --> 13:34.226
You have no idea who you're dealing with.

13:50.112 --> 13:52.376
Hey, Whitney.

13:52.681 --> 13:54.546
Whitney?

13:54.716 --> 13:59.244
- Hey.
- I'm picking up a microwave for my mom.

13:59.855 --> 14:02.983
You can pick it up at the back counter.

14:03.158 --> 14:05.649
Is everything okay?

14:08.096 --> 14:11.554
I bet you think it's just great
to live in Smallville your whole life.

14:11.733 --> 14:16.067
- Take over the farm from dad.
- I'm not sure that's the life for me.

14:16.238 --> 14:20.368
- Sometimes you don't have a choice.
- Whitney, you'll get out of here.

14:20.542 --> 14:24.410
- You'll go further than anyone in town.
- I lost my scholarship, Kent.

14:26.415 --> 14:28.576
I'm sorry.

14:31.019 --> 14:33.613
Have you told Lana yet?

14:35.023 --> 14:38.049
I am going to spend the rest of my life
in this store...

14:38.227 --> 14:43.426
...develop a bad heart at fifty like my dad,
and become just another "remember him?"

14:46.468 --> 14:49.301
I'm never getting out of Smallville.

14:49.471 --> 14:51.701
Hey, man, you got these sneaks in a twelve?

14:51.873 --> 14:53.568
Yeah.

15:00.849 --> 15:02.874
You got a problem, bro?

15:03.051 --> 15:04.916
No.

15:05.087 --> 15:08.079
I'll go find this.

15:18.800 --> 15:20.427
Hey...

15:20.602 --> 15:22.399
- ... aren't you Whitney Fordman?
- Yeah.

15:22.571 --> 15:24.539
Wade Mahaney.

15:24.706 --> 15:28.233
I saw you throw 300 yards against
Topeka last year. That was a great game.

15:29.511 --> 15:32.275
I heard you were tracked
for a full ride to Kansas State.

15:33.482 --> 15:37.282
- It didn't work out. Size twelve, right?
- Yeah. Thanks, buddy.

15:38.253 --> 15:40.744
Man. Well, I know all about that.

15:40.922 --> 15:45.188
Senior year I got sacked, blew out
my knee, had to have four operations.

15:45.360 --> 15:46.520
Tough break.

15:46.695 --> 15:49.425
I had a dozen schools offer me
full scholarships...

15:49.598 --> 15:54.058
...and then it all went away,
just like that.

15:55.137 --> 15:57.401
So, what's your plan now?

15:57.572 --> 16:02.100
Don't have one. Just don't want
to do this the rest of my life.

16:03.145 --> 16:07.138
I hear you. Where's the future
in that, huh? Say...

16:07.749 --> 16:09.717
...we're having a party
at our place tonight.

16:10.152 --> 16:11.983
Why don't you swing by.

16:13.689 --> 16:16.123
I can't, I've got to close up.

16:16.291 --> 16:20.489
Come by after. Knock back a brew.
Detox from this.

16:22.230 --> 16:25.028
Come on, man, it'll be fun.

16:26.601 --> 16:28.899
Fun!

16:29.938 --> 16:32.736
I am the god of quarters.

16:39.247 --> 16:42.216
Let me give you the tour, bro.
Come on.

16:44.753 --> 16:47.916
- This place is awesome.
- Maybe we could bring you on, Fordman.

16:48.090 --> 16:51.856
- Always use a talented guy.
- Why do you wanna help me?

16:52.027 --> 16:54.052
Guys like us got to stick together.

16:54.229 --> 16:57.255
I thought my life was over after football
didn't pan out.

16:57.432 --> 16:59.957
It was just beginning.

17:12.247 --> 17:13.544
Trust me...

17:13.714 --> 17:18.049
...it only gets better. Let me show you
where the real party is.

17:22.424 --> 17:23.891
You ever been inked?

17:24.059 --> 17:26.357
I'm not really into tattoos.

17:26.528 --> 17:30.191
Initiation, bro.
First one's on the house.

17:30.365 --> 17:33.061
I don't know, man, they're kind of forever.

17:33.235 --> 17:38.138
- You wanna eat with the big dogs?
- You got to step up to the bowl.

17:39.841 --> 17:44.073
This is like nothing
you've ever seen before.

17:44.246 --> 17:47.773
Make you feel like a new man, swear to God.

17:47.949 --> 17:50.179
Have a seat.

17:54.589 --> 17:56.113
All right.

17:56.291 --> 17:59.727
Just make sure
it doesn't say "Smallville."

18:34.696 --> 18:36.891
Yeah, baby!

18:43.605 --> 18:44.697
No! No!

18:46.408 --> 18:48.899
- Hey! Hey, come on!
- Be the truck!

18:49.077 --> 18:52.808
- Be the truck! Be the truck!
- You guys are crazy!

18:54.216 --> 18:55.581
No!

19:02.858 --> 19:05.884
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

19:06.061 --> 19:08.461
- Yeah, baby!
- Yeah!

19:08.930 --> 19:12.195
- Yeah.
- Yeah! You got it!

19:23.512 --> 19:24.604
Hey.

19:25.013 --> 19:27.447
Your dad called
and told me you were awake.

19:28.149 --> 19:31.277
You're officially my first visitor.

19:32.387 --> 19:34.252
How you feeling?

19:34.422 --> 19:38.552
Like a million bucks, thrown in
the washing machine and set on spin.

19:39.127 --> 19:42.654
- Everyone was real worried about you.
- Yeah, I noticed.

19:42.831 --> 19:45.664
Looks like Nell's flower shop's
been stripped clean.

19:46.067 --> 19:49.230
I especially like the ones from Lex.

19:49.571 --> 19:52.404
They make me feel like I won
the Kentucky Derby.

19:57.479 --> 20:01.540
They're beautiful, Clark.
They're my favorite.

20:02.918 --> 20:04.715
I...

20:04.886 --> 20:07.320
I just wanna say I'm sorry.

20:09.591 --> 20:11.058
For what?

20:12.360 --> 20:14.726
Letting you get hurt.

20:14.896 --> 20:18.354
Well, I am perturbed with you, Clark.

20:18.533 --> 20:21.832
I'm also mad that you didn't put out
the Chicago Fire of 1871.

20:22.504 --> 20:26.406
Or prevent the fall of the Roman Empire,
making you responsible for the Dark Ages.

20:29.077 --> 20:31.238
Thanks.

20:33.181 --> 20:37.083
Do you remember anything about those guys?

20:37.252 --> 20:41.746
There was one thing. The guy that
grabbed me had a tattoo on his forearm.

20:42.591 --> 20:44.957
An octagon, maybe.

20:45.493 --> 20:48.985
- What's going on, Clark?
- I don't know.

20:49.164 --> 20:51.689
Let me do some digging.

20:51.866 --> 20:56.701
Clark Kent, investigative reporter.
Has a nice ring to it.

21:02.010 --> 21:05.036
- You get some rest.
- I'll try.

21:08.049 --> 21:10.381
Thank you.

21:13.989 --> 21:16.150
This theater means something
to a lot of people.

21:16.324 --> 21:20.420
I spent every Saturday of my childhood here,
eighth row center.

21:20.595 --> 21:22.995
When the lights went down
and the screen flickered on...

21:23.164 --> 21:26.998
...the problems outside these doors
just disappeared.

21:27.869 --> 21:30.963
It was like being transported
to a magical place.

21:31.139 --> 21:35.576
That's a nice story, but why is it
so important to you really?

21:38.647 --> 21:43.812
My parents met here. I guess I'm just
looking for something to hold on to.

21:46.121 --> 21:51.991
I'm supposed to preserve this monument
to Lana Lang's sentimental memories.

21:52.160 --> 21:54.560
That's not what I meant.

21:54.729 --> 21:59.428
You're a teenager, Lana.
Mercurial doesn't do you justice.

22:01.369 --> 22:05.169
Thought you might understand.
Clearly I was mistaken.

22:05.340 --> 22:07.171
This is business, Lana.

22:07.342 --> 22:11.802
All these stores are becoming office spaces.
This town needs a parking garage.

22:13.048 --> 22:15.141
So you're going ahead with your plans.

22:15.316 --> 22:18.717
You haven't given me
any reason to change my mind.

22:19.387 --> 22:22.788
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a pressing matter to attend to.

22:34.569 --> 22:36.867
Whitney, you have a minute?

22:38.506 --> 22:40.201
I'm kind of busy.

22:41.743 --> 22:44.405
Remember the guy who came in
yesterday, looking for shoes?

22:44.579 --> 22:47.173
- No. A lot of guys come in here.
- Whitney, this is serious.

22:48.149 --> 22:49.707
Take it easy.

22:51.052 --> 22:54.886
- Where'd you get that tattoo?
- Mind your own business.

22:55.056 --> 22:58.116
Look, did those guys give it to you?

22:59.394 --> 23:01.328
Whitney, they're bad news.

23:03.998 --> 23:08.765
You spend your time trying to steal Lana.
Now, you wanna become my Boy Scout.

23:08.937 --> 23:11.098
That's not true.

23:11.272 --> 23:14.400
It's tough seeing yourself the way
others see you, isn't it, Kent?

23:15.043 --> 23:18.979
- Stay away from those guys.
- You're not my father, Kent.

23:19.147 --> 23:22.082
Now, get the hell out of here.

23:36.698 --> 23:40.259
Hey. Nell said you called.
Sounded urgent.

23:41.402 --> 23:44.894
- Have you seen Whitney today?
- Yeah. I asked him what was going on.

23:45.073 --> 23:47.871
He said he was out with some
new friends, blowing off steam.

23:48.042 --> 23:51.409
When I tried to press him,
he got angry, so I backed off.

23:52.781 --> 23:57.480
It's hard watching people you love suffer
and there's nothing you can do to help.

23:58.553 --> 24:03.081
Lana, I don't know if I'm supposed to tell
you this, but Whitney lost his scholarship.

24:03.691 --> 24:05.750
What?

24:05.927 --> 24:08.987
Why didn't he tell me?

24:10.665 --> 24:15.295
He was so close to his dream, and then
to just have it taken away like that.

24:15.470 --> 24:17.097
Must hurt like hell.

24:18.006 --> 24:20.133
Thanks for telling me.

24:20.308 --> 24:22.833
You're a good friend.

24:28.583 --> 24:31.347
<i>I raided the Torch. I think these
are Whitney's new friends.</i>

24:32.353 --> 24:35.789
Wade Mahaney and Scott Bowman.
Class of '96.

24:36.457 --> 24:39.449
- Who are these guys?
- They were Whitney, six years ago.

24:39.627 --> 24:43.859
Athletes, lettered in football, baseball,
basketball. They ruled the school.

24:44.666 --> 24:48.033
<i>- What happened?
- Well, according to the Ledger...</i>

24:48.203 --> 24:50.262
...Wade got injured
and Scott started using drugs.

24:50.572 --> 24:53.769
They watched their futures vanish.

24:54.375 --> 24:57.640
- Do you think Whitney's in trouble?
- I don't know.

24:57.812 --> 25:01.373
I tried to talk to him,
but he wouldn't listen to me.

25:02.016 --> 25:04.814
He thinks that scholarship
is his only way out of here.

25:04.986 --> 25:08.683
I wish he'd see himself the way I do.
There's more to him than football.

25:08.857 --> 25:11.417
- He's lucky to have you.
- Yeah.

25:11.593 --> 25:13.288
Big influence I am.

25:13.461 --> 25:16.794
Can't seem to convince anybody
to do anything today.

25:16.965 --> 25:19.490
Are you talking about the Talon?

25:19.667 --> 25:23.626
I met with Lex, tried to make my case,
but he totally shot me down.

25:23.805 --> 25:27.366
He said I hadn't given him
a good enough business reason.

25:27.542 --> 25:29.407
Sounds kind of harsh.

25:29.677 --> 25:30.871
Yeah.

25:31.045 --> 25:35.573
But I think the thing that makes me
maddest, is that he's right.

25:36.484 --> 25:40.215
Maybe it wasn't a rejection,
maybe it was a challenge.

25:40.388 --> 25:44.882
- My first challenge is helping Whitney.
- Let me work on that.

25:45.927 --> 25:50.364
Clark, why are you doing this?
Not that I don't appreciate it.

25:50.531 --> 25:55.230
I couldn't stop what happened to Chloe.
There's a chance for Whitney.

26:11.686 --> 26:13.677
You got a taste.

26:13.855 --> 26:17.120
You wanna find out
what it's all about, bro?

26:17.325 --> 26:20.226
Yeah. Sure, I'm in.

26:39.580 --> 26:42.378
<i>Glad you could make it, Luthor.</i>

26:42.550 --> 26:46.953
<i>Go inside. You'll find
a walk-in meat locker.</i>

26:47.121 --> 26:49.555
<i>Wait there.</i>

27:00.034 --> 27:02.264
Now what?

27:03.504 --> 27:05.631
Hello?

27:23.458 --> 27:26.484
- How did you...?
- Open the case, Lex.

27:27.762 --> 27:31.061
- I want the disk first.
- The money, Lex.

27:31.232 --> 27:32.995
Give us the money!

27:33.167 --> 27:34.464
- What's going on?
- Shut up.

27:43.644 --> 27:46.613
It's empty. He screwed us!

27:46.781 --> 27:51.650
- If I brought the money, I'd never get out.
- Big mistake, rich boy.

27:53.755 --> 27:56.451
I phase through your neck, I kill you.

27:57.825 --> 28:00.487
- We want the damn money!
- Stop it!

28:00.661 --> 28:02.993
- Give us the money!
- You never said we'd do this!

28:03.164 --> 28:04.859
I said, shut up!

28:05.333 --> 28:07.028
Stop it, you're killing him!

28:08.870 --> 28:11.134
Wade, time is almost up, we got to blow!

28:11.305 --> 28:13.569
Next time, bring the money!

28:30.058 --> 28:32.424
Whitney?

28:34.028 --> 28:35.996
Come on, rookie.

28:50.577 --> 28:53.341
What got into you, bro?
What were you thinking?

28:53.513 --> 28:56.505
- He wasn't thinking!
- I didn't sign on to kill anyone.

28:56.916 --> 28:58.543
Oh, is that it, Fordman?

28:58.718 --> 29:01.346
- You trying to quit?
- I'm not saying that. It's just...

29:02.655 --> 29:06.523
Luthor doesn't seem like the kind of guy
that would just pay up and then walk away.

29:06.693 --> 29:10.720
Don't worry about Luthor,
I put the fear of God in him!

29:10.897 --> 29:13.798
It's gonna be our biggest payday yet!

29:13.967 --> 29:16.492
All right, all right,
all right, that's enough.

29:16.669 --> 29:18.330
Homeboy's fine.

29:18.505 --> 29:20.973
- Just had a case of jitters, didn't you?
- Yeah.

29:21.140 --> 29:22.835
Yeah.

29:27.280 --> 29:32.115
- He's gonna screw everything up!
- Look at us, bro, we are burning up!

29:32.285 --> 29:36.619
We can't just keep tatting up. We need
fresh blood to keep this dream alive.

29:37.891 --> 29:41.156
Now go get a brew and chill out.

29:41.327 --> 29:43.727
Come on.

29:52.405 --> 29:54.270
Listen, bro.

29:54.440 --> 29:56.931
I went out on a limb for you just now.

29:57.110 --> 30:00.409
Don't let me down again.

30:01.347 --> 30:03.247
I won't.

30:05.151 --> 30:07.244
And don't sweat Luthor.

30:07.420 --> 30:10.719
As soon as he ponies up the cash,
I think he's gonna disappear...

30:10.890 --> 30:13.825
...for a very long time.

30:16.195 --> 30:18.163
Come on.

30:29.175 --> 30:30.665
All right, Lex...

30:30.843 --> 30:33.641
...what were you doing with those guys?

30:35.949 --> 30:38.179
They were blackmailing me, Clark.

30:38.351 --> 30:41.149
I went there to make a drop.

30:42.789 --> 30:46.850
You're wondering if your father's
been right about me all along, aren't you?

30:48.127 --> 30:51.255
They stole a computer disk
that contains confidential information.

30:51.431 --> 30:53.899
- What was on it?
- Nothing illegal...

30:54.067 --> 30:56.467
...but it's not something
I want in the public domain.

30:56.869 --> 31:01.363
- That's why you didn't want cops involved.
- Clark, I told you I'd handle it.

31:01.541 --> 31:03.839
Question is, what were you doing there?

31:04.243 --> 31:05.835
I was following Whitney.

31:06.012 --> 31:08.446
He's been hanging with those guys.
I wanted to help.

31:08.615 --> 31:11.209
Is this because of Chloe?

31:12.485 --> 31:14.510
Clark, you can't save the world.

31:14.687 --> 31:17.622
All you'll end up with is
a messiah complex and a lot of enemies.

31:18.324 --> 31:21.384
I saved you, didn't I?
That turned out all right.

31:25.064 --> 31:26.395
What's your next move?

31:26.899 --> 31:31.029
They're gonna learn
that it doesn't pay to rob Lex Luthor.

31:31.204 --> 31:32.865
What about Whitney?

31:33.272 --> 31:36.435
A man is measured
by the quality of his friends.

31:36.609 --> 31:39.840
If the quarterback's with them,
he'll have to face the consequences.

31:59.098 --> 32:00.827
Pete?

32:01.334 --> 32:03.393
<i>We were supposed to meet at the Torch.</i>

32:03.569 --> 32:05.503
Yeah, well, Chloe called...

32:06.139 --> 32:09.336
- ... and I told her what we were doing...
- So I insisted you guys come here.

32:09.509 --> 32:12.535
- You should be resting.
- All this resting is driving me insane.

32:12.712 --> 32:17.046
These so-called "health-care professionals"
just want me in bed eating Jell-O.

32:17.216 --> 32:19.116
Those fascists.

32:20.853 --> 32:23.583
I need to do this, okay?
Don't cut me out of it, please?

32:23.923 --> 32:24.912
Okay.

32:25.458 --> 32:28.256
So I was surfing the Net,
doing some research...

32:28.428 --> 32:30.362
How'd you get online here?

32:30.530 --> 32:33.465
Pete hijacked the phone line for me.

32:36.736 --> 32:37.725
What have you got?

32:37.904 --> 32:41.396
What if these guys are using meteorite
tattoos to speed up their metabolism?

32:41.641 --> 32:45.236
I mean, their molecules
are literally moving at hyperspeed.

32:46.045 --> 32:49.606
- That's how they go through solid objects?
- That's crazy.

32:49.782 --> 32:52.478
Well, they're doing it.

32:52.819 --> 32:54.252
It's like the ultimate rush.

32:54.420 --> 32:58.254
But there's no way their bodies
can handle that kind of stress for long.

32:58.424 --> 33:00.153
What are you saying will happen?

33:00.693 --> 33:03.719
You take the ultimate rush,
you pay the ultimate price.

33:11.804 --> 33:13.863
Nell?

33:14.841 --> 33:17.275
Nell, is that you?

33:25.251 --> 33:26.616
Whitney.

33:26.786 --> 33:29.016
I'm in trouble, Lana.

33:29.188 --> 33:30.780
I messed up.

33:30.957 --> 33:32.618
I trusted the wrong guys.

33:32.892 --> 33:34.883
I'm sorry.

33:35.061 --> 33:37.120
I let you down.
I just don't know what to do.

33:38.164 --> 33:41.691
It's okay. It's okay.

33:51.277 --> 33:53.871
After they get the money,
they're gonna kill Lex...

33:54.046 --> 33:55.775
...and probably me for betraying them.

33:55.948 --> 33:58.712
- You did the right thing.
- Yeah, too little too late.

33:58.885 --> 34:00.375
Where are they now?

34:01.087 --> 34:03.988
Back at the loft, sleeping it off.

34:04.157 --> 34:07.593
- Did you see the disk they stole from Lex?
- No.

34:07.727 --> 34:10.059
But it's gotta be there.
I can sneak in and get it.

34:10.362 --> 34:13.799
- It's dangerous. We should call the police.
- No cops.

34:13.966 --> 34:16.491
- I'm already in enough trouble.
- Tell me where they are.

34:16.668 --> 34:21.766
- I can get in and out before they wake.
- I can't let you go alone, Clark.

34:22.275 --> 34:25.335
I got myself into this mess,
I gotta try and get myself out of it.

34:38.491 --> 34:40.652
Empty. They must be out looking for me.

34:40.827 --> 34:44.058
Well, let's find it before they come back.

34:54.473 --> 34:56.407
It's not here.

34:56.576 --> 35:00.444
Keep looking.
It's gotta be here somewhere.

35:12.825 --> 35:15.191
I got it.

35:30.643 --> 35:33.407
You really screwed up, rookie.

35:39.852 --> 35:44.812
Look, I don't know how you found
that disk, bro, but I need it back. Now.

36:01.040 --> 36:05.170
Hurts, doesn't it? It feels like someone's
chewing up your insides.

36:05.344 --> 36:09.110
I stay in long enough,
I could do some serious damage.

36:19.225 --> 36:21.693
You're next, bro.

36:35.408 --> 36:37.467
Wade, please.

36:37.643 --> 36:40.077
Keep moving, rookie.

36:46.452 --> 36:49.717
I know what happened to your arm
in the bank vault.

36:50.656 --> 36:53.955
Occupational hazard.
We waited too long.

36:54.126 --> 36:57.459
Didn't hurt. When I pulled out,
it was fused at the shoulder.

36:57.630 --> 37:00.121
You can't keep doing this.
You're gonna die.

37:00.299 --> 37:04.861
If you hadn't have screwed up
our retirement plan, we wouldn't have to!

37:05.037 --> 37:06.766
But now...

37:06.939 --> 37:09.464
...you're gonna pay.

37:14.513 --> 37:16.811
- How'd you find us?
- Lana called...

37:16.983 --> 37:19.952
...told me what you guys were doing.
You should've called me first.

37:20.119 --> 37:22.417
- I've gotta find Whitney.
- Clark, wait.

37:22.588 --> 37:24.954
I'm calling the police.

37:35.334 --> 37:37.029
I thought you understood.

37:37.203 --> 37:39.068
This was your chance to be on top again.

37:39.238 --> 37:42.503
I thought my life was over when
I lost my scholarship, but I was wrong.

37:42.675 --> 37:45.838
No. You were right, your life is over.

37:46.145 --> 37:49.581
Remember your initiation, bro?
That's how you joined us.

37:49.749 --> 37:53.981
Well, that's how you're gonna leave.
We're running out of time, grab the remote.

37:56.956 --> 37:59.049
Let him go.

38:05.164 --> 38:07.359
The cops are on their way.

38:08.034 --> 38:11.197
Think again, rookie.
There's only one way off this team.

38:11.370 --> 38:12.962
Don't worry, I got you covered.

38:17.610 --> 38:20.477
Yeah!

38:38.864 --> 38:40.729
Don't move!

38:42.068 --> 38:45.037
- Keep your hands up!
- Keep them up!

38:48.841 --> 38:51.309
Up against the car!

38:57.083 --> 38:59.813
What did you tell the police?

39:00.052 --> 39:02.282
The truth.

39:02.688 --> 39:06.624
Those guys broke into my house. You two
figured it out, tried to be heroes...

39:06.792 --> 39:08.657
- ... and got in over your heads.
- What about-?

39:08.828 --> 39:10.659
Walking through walls part?

39:10.830 --> 39:14.391
I don't think the cops could handle
that much truth.

39:14.733 --> 39:17.463
Sorry about your disk.

39:18.337 --> 39:22.433
I didn't come out here for that, Clark.
I came because my friend was in trouble.

39:24.143 --> 39:26.270
Thanks.

39:41.260 --> 39:42.818
Just remember, boys:

39:42.995 --> 39:46.431
You keep my secret, and I'll keep yours.

39:52.738 --> 39:54.433
And if you don't...

39:54.607 --> 39:57.906
...you'll find out you're not the only ones
who can reach through walls.

39:59.512 --> 40:01.912
Move this vehicle.
We have to transport the suspects.

40:02.081 --> 40:03.241
Yes, sir.

40:05.417 --> 40:09.854
- Ah, the sweet smell of freedom.
- You were in the hospital, not Alcatraz.

40:10.022 --> 40:13.355
You spend a week in there and you'd feel
like a prisoner too. Come on.

40:13.526 --> 40:16.723
Bad food, lights out by nine and no cable?

40:16.896 --> 40:19.029
I'm thinking about doing an expose.

40:21.901 --> 40:25.166
- How's Whitney, by the way?
- He's taking it one day at a time.

40:25.337 --> 40:28.795
Good. All right, well, bye.

40:29.074 --> 40:31.736
- Oh, sorry.
- Chloe, where are you going?

40:32.311 --> 40:34.279
I'm gonna do some checking
with the police.

40:34.446 --> 40:36.505
None of the tattoo ink
was found at the loft...

40:36.682 --> 40:39.242
...and Scott and Derek aren't
saying anything to anyone, so...

40:39.418 --> 40:40.976
I smell a cover-up.

40:41.153 --> 40:43.314
Chloe?

40:43.489 --> 40:44.854
It's good to have you back.

40:45.524 --> 40:47.583
Thanks.

40:52.097 --> 40:53.860
He's early.

40:54.233 --> 40:56.326
Okay, here goes nothing.

40:56.502 --> 40:58.402
It's a good plan.

40:58.571 --> 41:01.165
Thanks for all your help. Wish me luck.

41:01.440 --> 41:03.635
You don't need it.

41:12.451 --> 41:15.045
Thanks for coming.

41:15.588 --> 41:17.385
I was surprised by your call.

41:17.556 --> 41:20.457
After our last meeting,
I didn't think I'd hear from you again.

41:20.626 --> 41:23.220
This time I came prepared.

41:24.663 --> 41:26.130
What's this?

41:26.632 --> 41:29.123
My business proposal.

41:29.301 --> 41:31.997
Small towns across the country
have revived their downtowns...

41:32.171 --> 41:35.504
...returning them to the social centers
they once were. They didn't do this...

41:35.674 --> 41:38.006
...by building cookie-cutter malls
or parking garages.

41:38.177 --> 41:41.305
They did it by restoring the great
buildings that were already there...

41:41.480 --> 41:43.641
...turning them into cafes,
bookstores, restaurants.

41:43.816 --> 41:47.047
You want to turn the Talon
into a cafe/bookstore?

41:47.219 --> 41:50.052
It could also be a venue
for local bands and arthouse movies.

41:50.222 --> 41:52.986
I found out you can
register the building...

41:53.158 --> 41:56.389
...as a historic landmark,
which gives you certain tax benefits.

41:56.996 --> 42:00.397
Just don't ask me to explain them.

42:01.200 --> 42:03.191
Who's gonna manage it?

42:03.369 --> 42:05.462
Nell said she'd be interested.

42:05.638 --> 42:09.665
And I can train with her after school,
and try running it myself in the summers.

42:09.842 --> 42:12.572
How'd you come up with this?

42:12.845 --> 42:16.076
Something Clark said.
He told me you like to challenge people.

42:16.248 --> 42:18.773
Well, you've definitely risen
to the challenge.

42:19.918 --> 42:21.613
So it's a deal?

42:21.787 --> 42:25.484
I need to look over
everything but, yeah...

42:25.658 --> 42:27.922
- ... it's a deal.
- Really?

42:28.727 --> 42:29.955
Really.

42:30.129 --> 42:34.122
I think this could be the start
of a very interesting partnership.
