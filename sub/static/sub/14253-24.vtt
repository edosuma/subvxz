00:14.381 --> 00:16.781
Shuttlecraft Dawkins
to Jupiter Station.

00:16.850 --> 00:17.782
Go ahead.

00:17.851 --> 00:19.785
Uh, this is
Lieutenant Reginald Barclay

00:19.853 --> 00:21.787
requesting permission to dock.

00:21.855 --> 00:23.789
Granted.

00:25.325 --> 00:26.815
What? What is it?

00:26.893 --> 00:29.191
lt's me, sir, Reg Barclay.

00:29.262 --> 00:30.559
Come in.

00:33.033 --> 00:34.295
Dr. Z.?

00:34.367 --> 00:35.857
How are you?

00:37.737 --> 00:40.228
Nice of you to finally drop by.

00:40.340 --> 00:43.832
l've been extremely busy- - 
the, uh, P- Pathfinder Project.

00:43.943 --> 00:46.138
You're still searching
for that ship?

00:46.212 --> 00:47.907
What's it called... Pioneer?

00:47.981 --> 00:49.505
Uh, Voyager.

00:49.582 --> 00:50.879
Voyager.

00:50.950 --> 00:52.315
Any luck?

00:52.385 --> 00:54.683
Actually, uh, we're on the verge
of a breakthrough- -

00:54.754 --> 00:57.154
uh, a communications link.

00:57.223 --> 00:58.747
Congratulations.

00:58.825 --> 01:01.316
The first transgalactic
phone call.

01:05.131 --> 01:08.225
ls there any word
from Starfleet Medical?

01:08.334 --> 01:09.824
Oh, doctors.

01:09.936 --> 01:12.769
l've been scanned and
probed a hundred times,

01:12.839 --> 01:14.397
and they still can't
tell me what's wrong.

01:14.507 --> 01:16.031
l'm sure it's only
a matter of time.

01:16.142 --> 01:17.336
l'm dying, Reginald,

01:17.410 --> 01:19.878
and there's nothing
anybody can do about it.

03:54.667 --> 03:56.692
Seven of Nine to the Bridge.

03:56.803 --> 03:58.236
Go ahead.

03:58.304 --> 04:01.296
We're receiving a transmission
from Starfleet.

04:03.343 --> 04:04.833
Route it here.

04:04.978 --> 04:08.379
lt's not a com- link, Captain- - 
it appears to be

04:08.448 --> 04:11.849
a compressed data stream...
badly degraded.

04:11.918 --> 04:13.249
On my way.

04:27.400 --> 04:31.837
They say good things
come in small packages.

04:31.904 --> 04:35.772
This is all the data
they could send us...

04:35.842 --> 04:37.639
until next month.

04:37.710 --> 04:39.940
Next month?

04:40.013 --> 04:41.947
They're using a cyclic pulsar

04:42.081 --> 04:44.914
to amplify signals
from the MlDAS array,

04:44.984 --> 04:47.851
but the cycle only peaks
every 32 days.

04:47.920 --> 04:49.251
So once a month,

04:49.322 --> 04:53.258
we'll be able to receive
a short burst of information,

04:53.326 --> 04:56.420
and we'll have
about 17 hours to respond.

04:56.496 --> 04:57.724
So far, we've gotten

04:57.797 --> 04:59.992
tactical updates,
letters from home,

05:00.066 --> 05:02.193
and news about
the Alpha Quadrant.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.361
l don't suppose they
found us a shortcut home?

05:04.470 --> 05:06.267
lt doesn't look that way.

05:06.339 --> 05:08.102
We don't have much time
to prepare a response,

05:08.174 --> 05:09.106
and we'll have

05:09.175 --> 05:10.107
to keep it short,

05:10.176 --> 05:11.541
but l want to give
everyone an opportunity

05:11.611 --> 05:12.873
to send something...

05:12.979 --> 05:14.879
even if it's only
a brief note.

05:14.981 --> 05:16.073
lnform the crew.

05:16.149 --> 05:17.878
- Yes, ma'am.
- Aye, Captain.

05:18.017 --> 05:21.009
Lieutenant Barclay,
the Pathfinder Project...

05:21.087 --> 05:23.078
they didn't give up on us.

05:23.156 --> 05:27.149
So when you write those letters,
you might want to thank them.

05:30.863 --> 05:33.559
Mail call.

05:33.633 --> 05:36.534
A letter? For me?

05:36.636 --> 05:39.571
Oh, it's from
Lieutenant Barclay.

05:41.607 --> 05:43.302
Bad news?

05:43.376 --> 05:44.638
Lewis Zimmerman.

05:44.711 --> 05:46.645
Apparently, he's seriously ill.

05:46.713 --> 05:47.941
Zimmerman?

05:48.047 --> 05:49.912
He's the father
of modern holography.

05:49.982 --> 05:52.576
He invented the matrix
that made my program possible.

05:52.652 --> 05:55.815
Oh. What's wrong with him?

05:55.888 --> 05:58.948
He's suffering from acute
subcellular degradation.

05:59.058 --> 06:00.821
''The doctors here are having
trouble finding the cause,

06:00.893 --> 06:02.121
''much less the treatment.

06:02.195 --> 06:03.787
''l've included
his medical files.

06:03.863 --> 06:05.797
''As you'll see,
the prognosis isn't good.

06:05.865 --> 06:07.799
''They say he's only got
a few months.

06:07.867 --> 06:10.131
''l'm sorry l don't have
better news to report,

06:10.236 --> 06:13.171
but l thought
you'd want to know.''

06:13.239 --> 06:14.797
How well did
you know him?

06:14.907 --> 06:17.501
l've never met the man.

06:17.577 --> 06:19.340
lf you'd like to
send a response,

06:19.412 --> 06:22.347
the captain will need
it by 1900 hours.

06:34.160 --> 06:36.185
Here's the information
you requested.

06:36.262 --> 06:38.196
Thank you.

06:38.264 --> 06:39.856
You're reviewing
his medical data.

06:39.932 --> 06:43.026
l thought l could send
Starfleet a second opinion.

06:43.136 --> 06:44.831
lt's a long shot, but maybe

06:44.937 --> 06:46.404
my experiences
in the Delta Quadrant

06:46.472 --> 06:47.905
could provide some insights.

06:47.974 --> 06:48.906
l was hoping these Borg

06:48.975 --> 06:50.602
regeneration techniques
might help them

06:50.676 --> 06:53.611
develop a treatment
for his condition.

06:53.679 --> 06:55.704
You bear a striking resemblance.

06:55.782 --> 06:57.443
He used his own
physical parameters

06:57.517 --> 06:59.451
as a model for my matrix.

06:59.519 --> 07:01.214
Can't say l blame him.

07:01.287 --> 07:04.154
A doctor needs to inspire
confidence in his patients.

07:04.223 --> 07:06.487
Compassionate eyes
and a strong chin

07:06.559 --> 07:08.049
can go a long way.

07:16.569 --> 07:18.332
l believe l can
help him, Captain.

07:18.438 --> 07:19.370
How?

07:19.439 --> 07:20.997
You remember the Vidiians?

07:21.107 --> 07:22.870
The early stages of the phage

07:22.942 --> 07:25.376
are very similar to
Dr. Zimmerman's disease.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.208
l believe l can adapt a variety

07:27.280 --> 07:28.713
of Borg regeneration techniques

07:28.781 --> 07:30.112
to arrest the cell damage,

07:30.183 --> 07:33.880
maybe even reverse it.

07:33.953 --> 07:36.717
Make sure to pass along
your findings.

07:36.789 --> 07:38.723
Thank you, Doctor.

07:38.791 --> 07:41.726
Actually... l was hoping

07:41.794 --> 07:43.591
to administer
the treatment myself.

07:43.663 --> 07:45.597
What are you suggesting?

07:45.665 --> 07:48.498
l'd like you to send my program
back to the Alpha Quadrant.

07:48.601 --> 07:50.228
None of the doctors

07:50.336 --> 07:52.395
at Starfleet are familiar
with these techniques.

07:52.505 --> 07:54.439
lt would take them months
to fully understand them,

07:54.507 --> 07:55.735
much less put them to use.

07:57.343 --> 07:59.538
Even if we could send you,
you're needed here.

07:59.612 --> 08:00.874
Mr. Paris can
take over Sick Bay.

08:00.980 --> 08:03.642
He's more than capable.

08:03.683 --> 08:05.981
We've done this once before.
There weren't any problems.

08:07.053 --> 08:08.486
Three years ago...

08:08.554 --> 08:10.818
and we used alien technology.

08:10.890 --> 08:12.482
l've spoken to Seven of Nine.

08:12.558 --> 08:14.651
She believes we can
compress my program.

08:14.727 --> 08:16.160
There's limited space
in the data stream.

08:16.229 --> 08:18.663
lf we send you, there won't be
room for anything else.

08:18.731 --> 08:20.995
l realize l'd be asking the crew

08:21.067 --> 08:23.160
to make a sacrifice
on my behalf,

08:23.269 --> 08:25.203
but they can wait another month.

08:25.271 --> 08:27.432
Dr. Zimmerman
might not have that time.

08:27.540 --> 08:28.768
l'm sorry

08:28.841 --> 08:30.832
he's not doing well.

08:30.943 --> 08:32.534
Unusual man.

08:32.611 --> 08:34.203
l met him once at a conference.

08:34.280 --> 08:35.871
Managed to offend
just about everyone there,

08:35.948 --> 08:38.041
but he was certainly brilliant.

08:38.116 --> 08:40.051
l'm sure Starfleet is consulting

08:40.119 --> 08:41.711
their best physicians,
Doctor.

08:41.787 --> 08:44.051
They are, but no one's been able

08:44.123 --> 08:45.055
to develop a cure.

08:45.124 --> 08:47.388
l have, but l can't
treat a patient

08:47.460 --> 08:49.223
who's 30,000
light- years away.

08:49.295 --> 08:50.819
- l'm sorry.
- Captain...

08:50.897 --> 08:51.829
This is the first time

08:51.898 --> 08:53.388
we're attempting
to send a response.

08:53.466 --> 08:55.229
We don't know if it'll
even get through.

08:55.334 --> 08:56.733
l'm willing to take that risk.

08:56.836 --> 08:58.463
l'm not.

08:58.571 --> 09:00.664
He programmed me- -

09:00.773 --> 09:02.138
every algorithm,
every subroutine.

09:02.208 --> 09:03.470
lf it weren't
for his years of work,

09:03.543 --> 09:05.135
l wouldn't be standing here.

09:05.211 --> 09:07.145
l owe him something...

09:07.213 --> 09:09.477
and frankly, so does this crew.

09:09.549 --> 09:13.110
ln a way, he's responsible
for every life l've saved.

09:13.185 --> 09:16.814
Lewis Zimmerman designed the
template for Starfleet's EMH.

09:16.889 --> 09:19.983
You're one of thousands
based on that technology.

09:20.059 --> 09:22.357
lt's not as though
he's your father.

09:22.428 --> 09:23.986
From your perspective.

09:24.063 --> 09:27.658
From mine,
he's the closest thing l've got.

09:27.733 --> 09:33.137
lf l don't try to help him now,
l may never get the chance.

09:35.274 --> 09:36.832
You'll have to find a way
to convince Tom

09:36.943 --> 09:38.570
to take those duty shifts.

09:38.644 --> 09:40.236
He's already agreed.

09:42.949 --> 09:45.713
Tell him ''Captain
Jane'' said hello.

09:45.785 --> 09:47.377
That's what he kept calling
me at the conference.

09:47.453 --> 09:49.512
l think he did it just
to get on my nerves.

09:49.589 --> 09:52.353
l've heard he can be...
difficult.

09:52.425 --> 09:55.258
l certainly hope you get
a chance to find out.

09:55.328 --> 09:58.263
Thank you, Captain.

10:11.711 --> 10:12.837
Oh...

10:19.952 --> 10:21.214
My vocal processor...

10:21.287 --> 10:22.720
lt's not a malfunction.

10:22.788 --> 10:24.585
l've removed your
singing algorithms.

10:24.657 --> 10:26.215
They'll be stored
in the memory buffer

10:26.292 --> 10:27.224
until you return.

10:27.293 --> 10:28.453
Why?

10:28.527 --> 10:30.961
Your program's too large
for the data stream.

10:31.063 --> 10:33.531
l have to extract all
nonessential subroutines.

10:33.599 --> 10:34.827
They're essential to me.

10:34.900 --> 10:36.561
They're part of who l am.

10:36.669 --> 10:39.263
Are you planning on performing
opera during your visit?

10:39.372 --> 10:40.304
No.

10:40.373 --> 10:41.840
Will you be reciting poetry?

10:41.941 --> 10:42.965
Doubtful.

10:43.142 --> 10:44.973
Hoverball? Holo- photography?

10:45.044 --> 10:48.013
l may want to take a few
snapshots to document my trip.

10:48.114 --> 10:49.274
Sexual activities?

10:50.650 --> 10:52.550
l get the point.

10:52.618 --> 10:55.382
How much has to be left behind?

10:55.454 --> 10:57.319
12 megaquads.

10:57.390 --> 10:58.721
Hmm.

10:58.791 --> 11:02.750
l suppose you could get rid
of my athletic abilities...

11:02.828 --> 11:05.991
and my grand master
chess program.

11:06.065 --> 11:08.590
That leaves three megaquads.

11:08.701 --> 11:10.293
Your painting skills?

11:10.403 --> 11:12.598
Oh...

11:12.705 --> 11:14.935
lf you must.

11:15.041 --> 11:17.407
Try to leave a few
of my enhancements intact.

11:17.476 --> 11:21.936
l don't want to look like
every other EMH on the block.

11:22.048 --> 11:24.039
l think Dr. Zimmerman
will be very interested

11:24.116 --> 11:25.777
to see what l've learned.

11:25.851 --> 11:27.751
He probably never imagined

11:27.820 --> 11:30.653
what one of his own creations
could accomplish.

11:30.723 --> 11:35.160
l could spark a whole new
field in holographic research.

11:43.836 --> 11:45.394
Bon voyage.

11:45.504 --> 11:47.096
See you in a month.

11:48.607 --> 11:50.632
Don't get lost.

11:57.249 --> 11:59.149
lf l've told you once,

11:59.218 --> 12:02.483
l've told you a thousand times- - 
stay off the food.

12:02.555 --> 12:03.681
Haley?

12:03.756 --> 12:06.384
Haley, what's the status
of my lunch?

12:06.459 --> 12:08.051
lt's coming, Doctor.

12:08.127 --> 12:11.722
As if things weren't bad enough,
now l'm dying of starvation.

12:15.167 --> 12:16.634
Come in.

12:16.702 --> 12:17.896
Haley...

12:18.070 --> 12:19.935
Mr. Barclay, is something wrong?

12:20.005 --> 12:22.166
No, no, it's just the
opposite. ls he in?

12:22.274 --> 12:24.105
He's not taking visitors today.

12:24.176 --> 12:26.041
Tell him this is important.

12:26.112 --> 12:27.875
He's in a prickly mood.

12:27.947 --> 12:32.247
Oh. l brought something with
me that might cheer him up.

12:32.318 --> 12:34.513
Computer,
is the download complete?

12:34.587 --> 12:36.179
Affirmative.

12:39.892 --> 12:41.450
Lunch.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.229
That's not pork chops.

12:44.296 --> 12:45.228
lt's salad.

12:45.297 --> 12:46.355
l didn't ask for salad.

12:46.432 --> 12:47.729
lt's healthy.

12:47.800 --> 12:50.291
l'm dying. A piece of meat
won't kill me any quicker.

12:50.402 --> 12:51.630
Give the plants to Leonard.

12:51.737 --> 12:54.604
He's the one trying
to watch his weight.

12:54.673 --> 12:57.141
Lieutenant Barclay
is here to see you.

12:57.209 --> 12:58.608
l told you l wasn't...

12:58.677 --> 12:59.905
He says it's urgent.

12:59.979 --> 13:02.174
Can't it wait till l'm dead?

13:03.449 --> 13:05.007
All right, send him in.

13:05.084 --> 13:07.484
Three minutes- - 
he's got three minutes.

13:07.553 --> 13:08.986
Be civil to him, Lewis.

13:09.054 --> 13:10.715
He's worried about you.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.155
We all are.

13:23.269 --> 13:24.463
l found a friend

13:24.570 --> 13:25.935
waiting for me
at home.

13:26.005 --> 13:27.905
You don't have any friends.

13:27.973 --> 13:33.468
Well, l guess, uh, you could say
he's a friend of yours.

13:33.546 --> 13:37.209
Please state the nature
of the medical emergency.

13:40.152 --> 13:42.211
An EMH Mark- 1?

13:42.288 --> 13:44.848
l'm not in the mood
for nostalgia, Reginald.

13:44.924 --> 13:46.357
But this is the Mark- 1

13:46.425 --> 13:47.915
from Voyager.

13:47.993 --> 13:50.120
l was compressed
into a data stream

13:50.196 --> 13:52.221
and transmitted
from the Delta Quadrant.

13:52.298 --> 13:53.765
Congratulations.

13:53.833 --> 13:56.165
l recommend a tour
of Jupiter's third moon.

13:56.268 --> 13:58.964
l hear the lava flows are lovely
this time of year.

13:59.071 --> 14:00.936
l'm not here for a vacation.

14:01.073 --> 14:03.234
l'm here to treat your illness.

14:04.944 --> 14:08.778
You brought a Mark- 1
30,000 light- years to treat me?

14:08.848 --> 14:11.180
l was wrong about you,
Reginald- -

14:11.250 --> 14:12.717
you do have a sense of humor.

14:14.186 --> 14:16.484
Care to let me
in on the joke?

14:16.555 --> 14:18.045
You didn't tell him?

14:18.123 --> 14:19.886
Tell me what?

14:20.025 --> 14:21.686
Well, l- l...

14:21.760 --> 14:23.853
You're obsolete, extinct,

14:23.929 --> 14:25.794
yesterday's news.

14:25.865 --> 14:28.026
My program was retired?

14:28.100 --> 14:30.261
Retired? Not at all.

14:30.369 --> 14:32.166
The EMH Mark- 1 was reconfigured

14:32.271 --> 14:35.798
to scrub plasma conduits
on waste- transfer barges!

14:35.908 --> 14:38.342
l've been treated
by the Mark- 3,

14:38.410 --> 14:39.604
the Mark- 4, not to mention

14:39.678 --> 14:41.407
the finest real doctors
in Starfleet.

14:41.480 --> 14:43.277
None of them could help me!

14:43.349 --> 14:47.718
He has been running almost
continuously for six years.

14:47.786 --> 14:49.913
He has seen more things

14:49.989 --> 14:52.685
than most doctors
could even imagine.

14:52.758 --> 14:55.192
l also have an exceptionally
high tolerance

14:55.261 --> 14:56.956
for difficult patients.

14:57.096 --> 15:00.190
l didn't program you
for sarcasm.

15:00.266 --> 15:02.393
You'll find
l'm full of surprises.

15:04.370 --> 15:06.395
Show the good Doctor
to the plasma generator.

15:06.505 --> 15:08.735
l understand there's
quite a buildup of residue.

15:08.807 --> 15:10.775
lf we had more time,

15:10.843 --> 15:12.310
l'd enjoy trading barbs
with you,

15:12.411 --> 15:14.743
but right now, there's
a more pressing concern- -

15:14.813 --> 15:16.110
your life.

15:16.181 --> 15:17.478
l'm working on a treatment

15:17.549 --> 15:19.244
based on a disease l encountered

15:19.318 --> 15:21.684
in the Delta Quadrant,
but l'll need to run

15:21.754 --> 15:23.813
a complete analysis.

15:23.889 --> 15:26.323
However, if it's impossible
for you to believe

15:26.392 --> 15:29.384
that a lowly Mark- 1 could have
anything useful to offer,

15:29.461 --> 15:32.157
l'll be happy to pack my bags

15:32.231 --> 15:35.359
and go explore
those sulfur mines.

15:36.769 --> 15:39.533
Go ahead...

15:39.638 --> 15:41.105
scan away.

15:41.206 --> 15:43.174
l'll be outside.

15:47.379 --> 15:49.540
What were your initial symptoms?

15:49.615 --> 15:52.083
Radical hair loss.

15:54.453 --> 15:57.786
Fatigue, nausea,
joint inflammation.

15:57.856 --> 16:00.324
Have you traveled outside
the solar system recently?

16:00.392 --> 16:01.825
What's that got to do
with anything?

16:01.894 --> 16:03.521
Just answer the question.

16:04.797 --> 16:07.197
l haven't left Jupiter Station
in over four years.

16:07.266 --> 16:08.255
To your knowledge,

16:08.334 --> 16:10.666
have you been exposed
to theta- radiation?

16:10.769 --> 16:11.827
No.

16:12.004 --> 16:13.301
Neutron flux?

16:13.372 --> 16:14.600
Never.

16:14.707 --> 16:17.198
Have you had intimate
relations with a Bolian?

16:17.309 --> 16:20.472
These are questions first- year
medical students would ask.

16:20.546 --> 16:22.275
l'm just being thorough.

16:22.348 --> 16:24.748
Just being thorough.

16:27.252 --> 16:29.220
Did that creature just speak?

16:29.288 --> 16:30.482
His name's Leonard.

16:30.556 --> 16:31.682
He's a hologram.

16:31.757 --> 16:33.748
Computer, deactivate iguana.

16:35.627 --> 16:37.185
How dare you!

16:37.262 --> 16:39.355
l'm a doctor, not a zoo keeper.

16:39.431 --> 16:41.331
Has there ever been an epidemic
on this station?

16:41.400 --> 16:42.560
No! Enough questions!

16:42.668 --> 16:44.568
Finish your scans
and get out of here!

16:44.636 --> 16:45.330
Doctor...

16:45.437 --> 16:46.563
l said get out of here!

16:46.672 --> 16:47.730
l traveled halfway

16:47.840 --> 16:49.205
across the galaxy to treat you.

16:49.274 --> 16:51.208
The least you could do
is show a little gratitude.

16:51.276 --> 16:52.937
Thank you. Get out of here!

16:53.045 --> 16:54.478
l may be the only physician

16:54.546 --> 16:56.480
who can save your life- - 
you need me.

16:56.548 --> 16:57.708
Like hell.

16:57.783 --> 16:59.614
l brought your matrix
into this world,

16:59.685 --> 17:01.243
and l can take it out!

17:01.353 --> 17:02.945
l'm no longer a prototype.

17:02.988 --> 17:05.183
l have exceeded my
original programming.

17:05.257 --> 17:07.054
l'm no longer
under your control.

17:07.126 --> 17:08.354
Oh, really?

17:08.426 --> 17:12.363
Computer, transfer EMH
to the living quarters.

17:13.432 --> 17:15.400
How did it go?

17:27.378 --> 17:30.507
Power up the MlDAS array- - 
l'm leaving!

17:30.582 --> 17:33.050
What... what happened
this time?

17:33.118 --> 17:34.745
l ran a mitochondrial scan.

17:34.820 --> 17:36.879
There was something
odd about the results,

17:37.022 --> 17:38.887
so l spent a full
hour analyzing them,

17:39.024 --> 17:40.889
and what did l discover?

17:40.959 --> 17:43.325
He's a Vulcan marsupial.

17:43.395 --> 17:45.488
He reconfigured my tricorder!

17:47.099 --> 17:48.566
You find that amusing?

17:48.634 --> 17:50.898
A little... well, not really.

17:51.036 --> 17:52.435
Sounds like
you're making progress.

17:52.504 --> 17:54.028
How so?

17:54.139 --> 17:56.369
He only teases people he likes.

17:56.442 --> 17:57.636
Then he must love me.

17:57.709 --> 17:59.074
l take it that you, um,

17:59.144 --> 18:00.839
still haven't been
able to diagnose him.

18:00.946 --> 18:01.878
Oh, on the contrary.

18:01.914 --> 18:03.541
The patient appears
to be suffering

18:03.615 --> 18:06.516
from an acute case of arrogance!

18:08.387 --> 18:09.752
Oh, that's Roy.

18:09.822 --> 18:11.790
Don't tell me- - a hologram?

18:11.857 --> 18:13.324
lt was commissioned

18:13.392 --> 18:14.586
by Starfleet lntelligence, uh,

18:14.660 --> 18:16.355
an experiment in
micro- surveillance.

18:16.428 --> 18:20.956
Dr. Z. keeps it around
as a sort of... a pet.

18:21.033 --> 18:23.024
Undercover insects?

18:23.102 --> 18:24.535
Talking iguanas?

18:24.603 --> 18:26.036
This isn't a research station.

18:27.773 --> 18:29.172
lt's a three...

18:29.241 --> 18:30.970
ring... circus.

18:31.710 --> 18:33.439
You should charge admission.

18:33.512 --> 18:34.570
Look... look, you know

18:34.646 --> 18:37.080
that we can't send you back
for another two weeks,

18:37.149 --> 18:40.312
so please, just...
just... keep trying.

18:40.385 --> 18:43.218
l can't treat a patient
who won't let me near him.

18:43.288 --> 18:44.653
He's deranged.

18:44.723 --> 18:46.315
What he needs is a counselor.

18:50.863 --> 18:53.696
Finally... l've accomplished
something.

19:00.172 --> 19:01.696
l thought you might be able

19:01.807 --> 19:03.468
to provide some, uh, insight.

19:03.542 --> 19:06.102
lt's not that simple, Reg.

19:06.178 --> 19:09.807
Dr. Zimmerman sounds like
a very complex individual.

19:09.882 --> 19:12.214
l'd need to speak
to him in person.

19:12.284 --> 19:15.185
Then maybe l could get him to
agree to a counseling session.

19:15.254 --> 19:17.814
The Enterprise is
in the middle of a mission.

19:17.923 --> 19:20.221
We're nearly seven light- years
from you.

19:20.292 --> 19:22.157
An important mission?

19:22.227 --> 19:24.195
They're all important, Reg.

19:24.263 --> 19:26.561
l could refer you

19:26.632 --> 19:29.192
to Counselor Jenzo,
a colleague of mine on Earth.

19:29.301 --> 19:31.565
l need the best, Deanna.

19:33.572 --> 19:36.132
lt would be
an interesting challenge.

19:36.241 --> 19:39.836
Thank you. Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

19:39.912 --> 19:41.277
Don't thank me yet.

19:41.346 --> 19:44.338
l'll still need to clear this
with Captain Picard.

19:44.416 --> 19:48.113
lf he agrees, l might be able
to be there by early next week.

19:48.187 --> 19:49.449
l'll see you then.

19:58.664 --> 19:59.961
Come in.

20:01.033 --> 20:02.295
Good morning.

20:02.401 --> 20:03.629
Mm- hmm.

20:03.735 --> 20:05.066
Problem?

20:05.170 --> 20:06.865
l haven't decided.

20:06.972 --> 20:10.772
l've just listened to
a communiqué from Admiral Hayes.

20:10.842 --> 20:13.640
Nice to have friends
in high places.

20:17.249 --> 20:18.910
Hello, Captain.

20:18.984 --> 20:21.748
l hope this message
finds you well.

20:21.820 --> 20:23.811
From what l understand,
it has not been easy,

20:23.889 --> 20:25.083
but l want you to know

20:25.157 --> 20:26.954
that a lot of people here
are very proud

20:27.025 --> 20:28.617
of what you've accomplished.

20:28.694 --> 20:31.094
l also want to assure you
that we have not given up

20:31.163 --> 20:33.154
finding a way to get you home.

20:33.232 --> 20:34.756
We've redirected
two deep space vessels

20:34.833 --> 20:36.095
toward your position.

20:36.201 --> 20:37.793
lf all goes well,
they could rendezvous

20:37.903 --> 20:40.565
with you
in the next five to six years.

20:41.840 --> 20:42.864
Computer...

20:42.975 --> 20:46.206
advance to time index 121.4.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.342
...as we get closer

20:49.414 --> 20:51.382
and our conversations
become more frequent.

20:51.450 --> 20:53.111
When you respond
to this message,

20:53.185 --> 20:56.279
please let us know
of any casualties.

20:56.355 --> 20:58.915
l'm sure you've had
more than your share.

20:58.991 --> 21:00.390
l'm anxious to know

21:00.492 --> 21:02.357
the status of your crew,
the Maquis,

21:02.394 --> 21:06.296
first contacts that you've made,
interactions with the Borg.

21:06.365 --> 21:08.697
But there'll be time
for everything.

21:08.767 --> 21:11.065
Our thoughts are with you.

21:11.169 --> 21:12.761
Talk to you soon.

21:18.277 --> 21:19.744
What?

21:19.811 --> 21:22.143
''Status of the Maquis.''

21:22.214 --> 21:23.704
Do you find that surprising?

21:23.782 --> 21:27.218
l don't think of you or B'Elanna
or the others as Maquis.

21:27.286 --> 21:29.413
l think of you
as part of my crew.

21:29.488 --> 21:33.083
You may have forgotten,
but we haven't.

21:34.860 --> 21:35.952
You heard the Admiral.

21:36.061 --> 21:38.859
lt'll be years before we have
to deal with those issues.

21:38.930 --> 21:40.261
Let's worry about it then.

21:40.332 --> 21:42.197
Do you have lunch plans?

21:42.301 --> 21:44.769
ls that an invitation?

21:44.836 --> 21:47.771
l was hoping you'd help me
compose a response.

21:47.839 --> 21:50.467
You're on.

22:00.118 --> 22:02.018
Doctor, your lunch is ready.

22:04.589 --> 22:06.216
Are you all right?

22:06.291 --> 22:07.883
Fine, Haley, fine.

22:07.959 --> 22:10.018
Give me a few minutes.

22:14.933 --> 22:16.730
Lower.

22:16.835 --> 22:19.463
Ah... perfect.

22:19.571 --> 22:22.131
l needed this.

22:22.240 --> 22:23.502
You have no idea

22:23.575 --> 22:26.601
what l've had to endure
these past few days.

22:28.613 --> 22:32.709
Last night... l woke up,

22:32.784 --> 22:38.381
and l found him hovering
over my bed with a hypospray.

22:40.158 --> 22:44.356
A smattering of photons,
that's all he is.

22:44.429 --> 22:45.657
What's that?

22:45.731 --> 22:48.063
What is that?
A tricorder?

22:48.133 --> 22:50.567
You were scanning me?

22:51.903 --> 22:55.134
Computer...
realign Voyager's EMH.

22:57.776 --> 22:59.676
- You!
- Remain calm.

22:59.745 --> 23:02.441
Emotional outbursts will only
aggravate your condition.

23:02.547 --> 23:05.015
l'll tell you what's aggravating
my condition- - you!

23:05.050 --> 23:06.574
lf you'd let me
examine you...

23:06.651 --> 23:07.811
l'll report you to the Medical

23:07.886 --> 23:09.251
- Ethics Board.
- Doctor...

23:09.321 --> 23:10.583
Save it for your hearing!

23:10.655 --> 23:12.589
lf you weren't so stubborn,
you'd see

23:12.657 --> 23:13.817
l'm only trying to help.

23:13.892 --> 23:16.224
l don't want your help.
Why won't you leave me alone?!

23:16.294 --> 23:18.762
Because, for reasons
beyond my comprehension,

23:18.830 --> 23:20.320
l care about you.

23:20.399 --> 23:23.163
You weren't programmed to care.

23:23.268 --> 23:25.065
You were programmed
to hold a scalpel.

23:25.170 --> 23:26.330
l told you

23:26.438 --> 23:29.464
l'm not the same EMH
you created six years ago.

23:29.574 --> 23:31.633
Of course- - 
you can sing and dance.

23:31.743 --> 23:34.143
l should install you
in a Ferengi nightclub.

23:34.212 --> 23:36.305
The Voyager crew
appreciates my attempts

23:36.381 --> 23:37.678
to expand my program.

23:37.749 --> 23:39.376
This isn't Voyager.

23:39.451 --> 23:42.386
lt's my lab, and in my lab,

23:42.454 --> 23:44.786
you're still just a hologram!

23:44.856 --> 23:46.483
A hologram you created.

23:46.558 --> 23:49.322
A hologram
who owes you his existence.

23:50.395 --> 23:52.260
ls that what's keeping you here?

23:52.330 --> 23:55.390
Some twisted sense
of obligation?

23:55.467 --> 23:56.866
Well, let me assure you,

23:56.968 --> 23:59.528
you don't owe me anything.

23:59.638 --> 24:00.605
Doctor?

24:00.705 --> 24:02.536
Yes, Haley, what is it?

24:02.607 --> 24:04.370
You have a visitor.

24:06.578 --> 24:09.638
Hello, l'm Deanna Troi.

24:09.714 --> 24:12.410
Which one of you
is Dr. Zimmerman?

24:18.590 --> 24:20.319
Deanna Troi.

24:20.392 --> 24:21.882
Another one of your tricks?

24:23.061 --> 24:24.619
Excuse me?

24:24.696 --> 24:25.856
Ow!

24:25.931 --> 24:26.989
He thinks you're a hologram.

24:27.065 --> 24:29.693
l can assure you
l'm quite real.

24:29.801 --> 24:32.395
Oh, well, the last
beautiful woman

24:32.504 --> 24:34.369
to walk in here
turned out to be him.

24:34.439 --> 24:35.770
l'll take that as a compliment.

24:35.841 --> 24:37.536
Hmm.

24:37.609 --> 24:38.940
Did l come at a bad time?

24:39.077 --> 24:40.772
Your timing
couldn't be better.

24:40.846 --> 24:43.280
The patient is suffering
from acute anxiety,

24:43.348 --> 24:45.714
normally associated
with terminal illness.

24:45.784 --> 24:47.752
lt's made him
agoraphobic, paranoid,

24:47.819 --> 24:50.947
and extremely antagonistic.

24:51.056 --> 24:53.081
l see.

24:53.158 --> 24:55.285
Mind if l sit down?

24:55.360 --> 24:56.952
Please.

25:00.465 --> 25:04.731
Reg tells me you won't let
the Doctor help you.

25:04.836 --> 25:06.804
He's a Mark- 1.
He's obsolete.

25:06.872 --> 25:09.500
l'd be safer in the hands
of a Klingon field medic.

25:09.608 --> 25:14.102
l understand he's developed
a promising treatment.

25:14.179 --> 25:15.407
lf you're a Borg drone.

25:15.480 --> 25:16.708
He's threatening to use

25:16.781 --> 25:19.215
some kind of ghoulish
assimilation technique.

25:19.284 --> 25:20.774
lt's not fit for a lab rat.

25:20.852 --> 25:22.717
You won't even look
at my research.

25:22.787 --> 25:25.221
From the moment l arrived,
you've berated me,

25:25.290 --> 25:27.383
treated me like
an antique.

25:27.459 --> 25:29.290
Well, let me
tell you something- -

25:29.361 --> 25:32.023
antique or not, l took
a huge risk coming here.

25:32.097 --> 25:33.826
l had to plead
with my Captain...

25:33.899 --> 25:35.696
leave my ship
without a surgeon.

25:35.767 --> 25:36.995
Doctor, imagine

25:37.102 --> 25:39.570
that your program was
seriously damaged,

25:39.671 --> 25:42.265
and the only person
who could repair you

25:42.374 --> 25:44.808
was an engineer
from, say...

25:44.876 --> 25:46.571
a hundred years ago.

25:46.645 --> 25:49.808
Would you feel comfortable
with that?

25:49.881 --> 25:52.372
lf he were skilled,

25:52.450 --> 25:54.315
intelligent, creative.

25:54.386 --> 25:56.183
Honestly, Doctor?

25:56.254 --> 25:59.314
A hundred years ago?

25:59.391 --> 26:01.416
Well, l suppose it
would give me pause.

26:01.526 --> 26:02.788
Ha!

26:04.729 --> 26:08.563
Now, put yourself
in the Doctor's shoes.

26:08.633 --> 26:11.659
lmagine you were asked
to treat someone

26:11.770 --> 26:12.964
you cared about- -

26:13.071 --> 26:14.732
say, an EMH Mark- 12.

26:14.839 --> 26:16.397
There is no Mark- 12.

26:16.508 --> 26:18.135
But if there were,

26:18.209 --> 26:20.006
and you wanted
to save his program,

26:20.078 --> 26:22.137
he probably wouldn't
let you near him.

26:22.213 --> 26:23.578
He wouldn't care

26:23.648 --> 26:25.809
that you'd won the Daystrom
Prize for holography.

26:25.884 --> 26:29.445
From his perspective,
you'd be out of date.

26:29.521 --> 26:34.083
But what if you knew
you could save him?

26:37.462 --> 26:39.327
Thank you, Counselor,

26:39.397 --> 26:41.627
for extending that olive branch.

26:41.700 --> 26:45.363
l'm willing to see past
our differences, if he is.

26:48.540 --> 26:50.405
All right.

26:52.177 --> 26:54.509
He can start by purging
the plasma conduits on Deck 6.

26:54.579 --> 26:56.547
Dr. Zimmerman...

26:56.615 --> 26:59.049
l will not put my life
in the hands of a primitive.

26:59.117 --> 27:01.017
You'd need a phaser drill
to get through

27:01.119 --> 27:02.177
that thick skull of his!

27:02.220 --> 27:03.152
Get out!

27:03.221 --> 27:04.210
Gentlemen...

27:04.289 --> 27:05.950
Oh, spare us your psychobabble.

27:06.024 --> 27:08.390
l came here thinking
that you were

27:08.460 --> 27:10.690
opposite sides
of the same coin- -

27:10.762 --> 27:13.526
identical, but different.

27:13.598 --> 27:16.692
Now l see you're both
exactly the same.

27:16.801 --> 27:18.234
You're both jerks.

27:20.138 --> 27:21.765
Jerks.

27:27.112 --> 27:28.875
l'm starting to think you called

27:29.014 --> 27:30.481
the wrong Counselor, Reg.

27:30.548 --> 27:32.243
Oh, you'll figure something out.

27:32.317 --> 27:33.409
You always do.

27:33.485 --> 27:35.214
Things are worse now

27:35.286 --> 27:36.412
than when l arrived.

27:36.488 --> 27:38.285
Lewis won't come
out of his lab,

27:38.356 --> 27:40.415
and the EMH is hiding
in a holodeck.

27:40.492 --> 27:42.016
He's feeling homesick.

27:42.093 --> 27:44.584
l- l- l let him use
my Voyager simulation,

27:44.663 --> 27:47.131
and it seems to be
cheering him up.

27:48.900 --> 27:52.267
A hologram fighting to save
the life of his creator...

27:52.370 --> 27:55.533
who just so happens
to be the same man

27:55.640 --> 27:58.336
his own personality
is based on.

27:58.410 --> 28:00.708
l think l'd need
a whole team of therapists

28:00.812 --> 28:02.939
just to get them
in the same room.

28:02.981 --> 28:05.541
Mr. Barclay says this is
your favorite ice cream.

28:05.617 --> 28:07.778
l hardly deserve it,

28:07.852 --> 28:09.717
but thanks.

28:09.788 --> 28:11.312
You're a hologram.

28:11.389 --> 28:12.754
How do you know?

28:12.824 --> 28:14.086
l'm an empath.

28:14.159 --> 28:16.024
l haven't sensed
any emotions from you.

28:17.095 --> 28:18.653
When were you
first brought on line?

28:18.730 --> 28:20.163
Nine years ago.

28:21.900 --> 28:24.801
No offense,
but you're more antiquated

28:24.903 --> 28:26.700
than the EMH Mark- 1,

28:26.805 --> 28:29.638
and yet Lewis seems
to listen to you.

28:29.708 --> 28:31.676
Why do you suppose

28:31.776 --> 28:33.744
that is?

28:33.812 --> 28:36.872
Were you here when
the Mark- 1 was created?

28:36.981 --> 28:38.414
Yes.

28:38.483 --> 28:41.646
Any idea why Lewis
made it in his own image?

28:41.720 --> 28:44.086
Maybe you should ask him.

28:44.155 --> 28:45.713
l did.

28:45.790 --> 28:47.121
He evaded the question.

28:47.192 --> 28:49.387
l was hoping
you might know.

28:51.362 --> 28:54.126
He was extremely proud
of the Mark- 1.

28:54.199 --> 28:56.429
He used to dream
about hundreds of holograms

28:56.534 --> 28:58.798
in every corner of the Quadrant
saving lives.

28:58.903 --> 29:01.463
He put so much of himself
into its development.

29:01.573 --> 29:03.268
l suppose
it only seemed natural

29:03.341 --> 29:05.275
that it should look
like him, too.

29:05.343 --> 29:06.742
But the Mark- 1

29:06.811 --> 29:09.143
failed to meet
Starfleet's expectations.

29:09.214 --> 29:10.943
He was devastated.

29:11.015 --> 29:13.074
He... he locked himself away

29:13.151 --> 29:15.119
in this lab for two years,

29:15.186 --> 29:17.313
trying to repair
the defects.

29:17.388 --> 29:20.824
Finally, he just gave up,
uh, started from scratch...

29:20.959 --> 29:22.426
a whole new matrix.

29:22.494 --> 29:23.461
The Mark- 2.

29:23.528 --> 29:25.462
Followed by the Mark- 3

29:25.530 --> 29:27.225
and then the Mark- 4.

29:27.298 --> 29:30.324
He... he was obsessed
with perfecting it.

29:30.435 --> 29:33.836
But none of the later models
resembled Lewis.

29:33.905 --> 29:35.429
He made that mistake once.

29:35.540 --> 29:37.371
He wasn't about
to do it again.

29:37.442 --> 29:40.673
And now, after all this time,

29:40.745 --> 29:43.407
a Mark- 1 shows up.

29:46.518 --> 29:49.351
lt must be like staring
in a mirror

29:49.420 --> 29:52.321
at a reflection
you don't want to remember.

29:56.795 --> 30:00.561
Computer, resume recording.

30:00.632 --> 30:04.261
Last will and testament,
Dr. Lewis Zimmerman.

30:04.369 --> 30:07.805
Let's see, where were we?

30:07.906 --> 30:09.703
Subsection 8:

30:09.774 --> 30:13.073
''The Trojan Horse project.''

30:13.144 --> 30:17.706
l hereby bequeath
my latest research

30:17.782 --> 30:21.411
in holographic infiltration
technology

30:21.486 --> 30:25.650
to the only engineer l trust
to complete the work- -

30:25.723 --> 30:29.386
Lieutenant Reginald Barclay.

30:29.460 --> 30:32.088
Subsection 9:

30:32.163 --> 30:35.530
''Holographic Art.''

30:35.600 --> 30:38.569
l hereby bequeath
my entire collection,

30:38.636 --> 30:41.264
including
the 21st- century masterpiece

30:41.372 --> 30:45.001
Woman in Four Dimensions...

30:45.143 --> 30:50.513
to the person who has
appreciated it the most- -

30:50.582 --> 30:54.882
l... guess that would be
Reg Barclay, too.

30:56.588 --> 30:59.056
Subsection 10:

31:01.125 --> 31:02.956
''Haley.''

31:06.497 --> 31:09.227
l realize she's only a hologram,

31:09.334 --> 31:14.203
but she's been a loyal assistant
for many years.

31:14.272 --> 31:16.638
l'd like to request

31:16.708 --> 31:19.677
that Starfleet keep
her program running

31:19.777 --> 31:23.736
for as long as
this research facility exists.

31:29.387 --> 31:33.346
She's been as real to me
as anyone l've ever known.

31:36.828 --> 31:39.228
Not that l've known many people.

31:41.833 --> 31:44.358
l've created most of my friends.

31:54.479 --> 31:57.937
Pause recording.

32:14.632 --> 32:18.466
Don't worry, l'll find
a home for you, too.

32:38.990 --> 32:41.220
So this is Voyager.

32:41.292 --> 32:43.089
l like it.

32:43.161 --> 32:44.685
lt's a remarkable facsimile,

32:44.762 --> 32:47.697
but Mr. Barclay did get
a few of the details wrong.

32:47.765 --> 32:50.131
For one thing,
Neelix doesn't purr.

32:50.234 --> 32:52.225
l think that may have
something to do

32:52.337 --> 32:53.463
with Reg's cat.

32:53.571 --> 32:55.198
He named it after your friend.

32:55.306 --> 32:56.671
Neelix would be honored.

32:56.741 --> 32:59.574
lf you're here for Dr.
Zimmerman's medical files,

32:59.644 --> 33:01.635
l've nearly finished
updating them.

33:01.746 --> 33:04.909
Maybe the next physician
will put them to better use.

33:04.949 --> 33:06.177
Actually...

33:06.250 --> 33:08.377
l stopped by
to ask you to dinner.

33:08.453 --> 33:10.114
l'm a hologram, Counselor.

33:10.188 --> 33:11.587
l don't eat.

33:11.656 --> 33:14.216
l know that, but we'd
still enjoy your company.

33:14.292 --> 33:15.884
We?

33:15.994 --> 33:19.657
Lieutenant Barclay,
Haley, myself...

33:19.731 --> 33:21.164
Dr. Zimmerman.

33:21.232 --> 33:23.564
No, thanks.
Unless that man's eating crow,

33:23.668 --> 33:24.566
l'm not interested.

33:24.669 --> 33:26.068
lt's the perfect opportunity

33:26.137 --> 33:27.331
for us to talk things out

33:27.438 --> 33:28.905
in a more casual environment.

33:28.973 --> 33:29.940
Sorry.

33:30.008 --> 33:30.997
Just one meal?

33:31.109 --> 33:32.303
l said no.

33:32.377 --> 33:33.309
Doctor?

33:33.378 --> 33:34.402
Something's wrong.

33:34.479 --> 33:35.810
Troi to Lieutenant Barclay.

33:35.880 --> 33:36.938
Go ahead.

33:37.015 --> 33:38.812
There's something wrong
with the EMH.

33:38.883 --> 33:40.111
Can- can you be more specific?

33:40.184 --> 33:41.776
She's a Counselor,
Lieutenant,

33:41.853 --> 33:42.785
not an Engineer.

33:42.854 --> 33:43.821
Stand by.

33:47.692 --> 33:49.353
What's happening to me?

33:49.427 --> 33:51.895
Your program is destabilizing.

33:51.963 --> 33:53.157
What? Why?

33:53.231 --> 33:55.563
They sent you
30,000 light- years.

33:55.633 --> 33:58.329
l...l should have expected
some problems.

33:58.436 --> 34:00.529
lt's not your fault,
Mr. Barclay.

34:00.638 --> 34:03.869
We just need to find a way
to repair the damage.

34:03.975 --> 34:06.341
You don't understand.

34:06.411 --> 34:08.402
Your primary matrix
is degrading,

34:08.478 --> 34:10.447
and there is nothing l can do.

34:17.922 --> 34:21.016
Good riddance to bad photons.

34:21.092 --> 34:22.422
He's dying, Lewis.

34:22.493 --> 34:24.188
He's not dying.

34:24.262 --> 34:25.752
His files are just degrading.

34:25.830 --> 34:28.594
There are people on Voyager
who count on him.

34:28.666 --> 34:29.893
l'll send them a Mark- 4.

34:30.001 --> 34:31.592
They're more reliable.

34:31.702 --> 34:33.431
They don't want a Mark- 4.

34:33.538 --> 34:35.335
They want their friend.

34:35.406 --> 34:38.204
No EMH was ever designed
to be anyone's friend!

34:38.275 --> 34:39.937
He's just a hologram.

34:40.078 --> 34:42.170
ls that how you feel about me?

34:42.246 --> 34:43.838
Just a hologram?

34:50.822 --> 34:53.052
l will not be ambushed
in my own lab.

34:53.123 --> 34:56.786
Stardate 53292.

34:56.860 --> 34:58.385
My program malfunctioned,

34:58.463 --> 35:00.363
and you canceled
a lecture on Vulcan

35:00.465 --> 35:02.592
and came all the way home
to repair me.

35:02.633 --> 35:04.294
There's nothing worse

35:04.402 --> 35:07.496
than addressing a room
full of pointy- eared blowhards.

35:07.605 --> 35:10.096
l was looking for an excuse
to get away.

35:10.208 --> 35:12.870
You came back
because you cared about me,

35:12.944 --> 35:15.469
just like you care
about the Mark- 1.

35:15.546 --> 35:18.242
You just won't admit it.

35:18.316 --> 35:19.476
He may not be perfect,

35:19.550 --> 35:21.541
but he's still one
of your creations,

35:21.619 --> 35:24.645
and right now,
he needs his creator.

35:24.722 --> 35:27.156
Don't turn your back on him.

35:43.474 --> 35:45.442
Computer,
activate Voyager's EMH.

35:45.543 --> 35:48.512
Please state the nature
of the medical emergency.

35:48.579 --> 35:49.511
You're the emergency.

35:49.580 --> 35:52.378
Where's Lieutenant Barclay?

35:52.450 --> 35:55.214
Trust me, you're in
far more capable hands.

35:55.286 --> 35:57.083
You're going
to repair my program?

35:57.155 --> 35:58.747
Who better?

35:58.823 --> 36:01.291
Just yesterday,
you threatened to decompile me.

36:01.392 --> 36:04.657
That was before your colleagues
made me feel guilty.

36:04.695 --> 36:06.185
You're ill.
You're in no condition

36:06.264 --> 36:08.129
to perform delicate procedures.

36:08.199 --> 36:09.393
l'll survive, but you won't

36:09.500 --> 36:11.297
if you don't relax
and let me finish.

36:12.904 --> 36:13.871
What are you doing?

36:13.938 --> 36:14.870
My scans identified

36:14.972 --> 36:17.304
a recursive error
in your pattern buffer.

36:17.375 --> 36:18.967
l'm trying to isolate it.

36:19.043 --> 36:21.637
ls that a fractal algorithm?

36:21.712 --> 36:22.974
Very good.

36:23.047 --> 36:25.538
l'm using it
to realign your matrix.

36:25.616 --> 36:28.278
Fractal algorithms are
notoriously unstable.

36:28.352 --> 36:30.217
ln the hands of a novice.

36:30.288 --> 36:31.550
Whoops.

36:31.622 --> 36:33.613
''Whoops''? What's ''whoops''?

36:34.825 --> 36:36.019
Computer, deactivate EMH.

36:36.093 --> 36:37.390
Ah...

36:48.372 --> 36:51.569
l- l... l can't move.

36:51.642 --> 36:52.802
l know.

36:52.877 --> 36:55.345
l had to take your
mobility subroutines

36:55.413 --> 36:56.778
off- line.

36:56.847 --> 36:58.439
How long have l
been deactivated?

36:58.516 --> 36:59.983
17 hours.

37:01.686 --> 37:04.280
l'm resetting your parameters.

37:05.990 --> 37:07.014
You don't look well.

37:08.125 --> 37:09.057
You need rest.

37:09.126 --> 37:10.058
l'm fine,

37:10.127 --> 37:11.185
and so are you.

37:11.262 --> 37:13.526
Your program's been stabilized.

37:13.598 --> 37:15.623
l... l'm going to be okay?

37:15.700 --> 37:17.531
No, you're going to be
better than okay.

37:17.635 --> 37:20.103
Now what are you doing?

37:21.205 --> 37:22.797
Welcome to Sick Bay.

37:22.907 --> 37:25.034
How may l help you today?

37:25.109 --> 37:26.303
Well, what do you think?

37:26.377 --> 37:28.208
l think you've altered
my greeting protocol.

37:28.279 --> 37:29.576
That's just the beginning.

37:29.647 --> 37:32.172
l've also added new subroutines

37:32.250 --> 37:35.879
for compassion, patience,
empathy, decorum.

37:35.953 --> 37:37.818
l don't feel any different.

37:37.888 --> 37:39.856
Because l haven't
installed them yet.

37:39.924 --> 37:42.757
l thought you'd like
to be awake for the big moment.

37:46.063 --> 37:48.088
Reginald was right about you.

37:48.165 --> 37:51.191
You have exceeded the
sum of your programming.

37:51.302 --> 37:52.462
You've accomplished

37:52.570 --> 37:55.266
far more than l would
have ever predicted.

37:55.373 --> 37:57.068
But let's face facts.

37:57.141 --> 38:00.042
You never overcame
the inherent flaws

38:00.111 --> 38:01.908
in your personality subroutines.

38:01.979 --> 38:04.709
You're arrogant, irritable- -

38:04.782 --> 38:07.114
''a jerk,'' as Counselor
Troi would say.

38:07.184 --> 38:09.709
l believe she was
describing you, as well.

38:09.787 --> 38:11.277
Don't change the subject.

38:11.355 --> 38:12.379
l may not be able

38:12.456 --> 38:14.185
to turn you into a Mark- 4,

38:14.258 --> 38:17.125
but l can make you
a bit more presentable.

38:17.194 --> 38:19.094
What if l'm happy
with the way l am?

38:19.163 --> 38:20.357
l'm doing you a favor.

38:20.431 --> 38:21.762
l don't want any favors,

38:21.832 --> 38:23.925
and l don't want
your new subroutines!

38:24.035 --> 38:25.832
Why can't you accept me
as l am?!

38:25.936 --> 38:28.029
Because you're defective!

38:30.007 --> 38:33.534
''Emergency Medical Hotheads!''

38:33.611 --> 38:36.739
''Extremely Marginal
House Calls.''

38:36.814 --> 38:38.805
That's what everyone used
to call the Mark- 1's,

38:38.883 --> 38:41.044
until they were bounced
out of the Medical Corps.

38:44.255 --> 38:46.120
l tried to have them
decommissioned,

38:46.190 --> 38:47.122
but Starfleet,

38:47.191 --> 38:49.022
in its infinite wisdom,
overruled me

38:49.093 --> 38:51.118
and reassigned them all to work

38:51.195 --> 38:53.823
waste- transfer barges.

38:57.101 --> 38:58.363
That's where you'd be, too,

38:58.469 --> 38:59.936
if you hadn't been lost

39:00.004 --> 39:01.437
in the Delta Quadrant.

39:10.648 --> 39:13.242
Do you know
how humiliating it is

39:13.317 --> 39:17.811
to have 67 5 Mark- 1's out there

39:17.922 --> 39:20.914
scrubbing plasma conduits...

39:20.991 --> 39:24.825
all with my face?

39:27.631 --> 39:30.964
l'm sure
they're doing a fine job.

39:31.135 --> 39:32.102
What are you doing?

39:32.169 --> 39:33.602
l'm not finished with you.

39:33.671 --> 39:34.968
l'm trying to do my job.

39:35.039 --> 39:36.165
And if you give me a chance,

39:36.273 --> 39:37.797
you'll see
that l'm pretty good at it.

39:41.846 --> 39:46.283
Frankly, l'd hoped
that if we ever met,

39:46.350 --> 39:47.942
you'd be proud of me.

39:49.720 --> 39:51.278
Well...

39:51.355 --> 39:56.122
l guess it is comforting to know
that at least one of you

39:56.193 --> 39:59.287
is still doing
what l designed you to do.

40:01.332 --> 40:05.462
Your intercellular proteins
are at a dangerous level.

40:05.569 --> 40:09.232
We should begin the procedure.

40:09.340 --> 40:11.171
Please?

40:11.242 --> 40:14.643
Give me a chance
to make you proud of me.

40:21.318 --> 40:26.278
Maybe we could try it;
see how it goes.

40:27.324 --> 40:29.588
See how it goes.

40:29.660 --> 40:32.925
Just don't expect me
to put you in my will.

40:43.140 --> 40:44.129
l- l'm going in.

40:44.241 --> 40:45.230
Reg...

40:45.342 --> 40:47.708
They have been in
there for 32 hours!

40:47.778 --> 40:49.302
Be patient.

40:52.716 --> 40:54.013
Well, you...

40:54.151 --> 40:55.778
You're not fritzing anymore.

40:55.853 --> 40:57.184
No thanks to you.

40:57.254 --> 40:58.687
Dr. Zimmerman ran

40:58.756 --> 41:00.724
a diagnostic
on my subtronic relays,

41:00.825 --> 41:03.191
and he made
a very interesting discovery.

41:03.227 --> 41:06.287
Apparently, l was the victim

41:06.363 --> 41:07.887
of foul play.

41:07.998 --> 41:10.262
Well, what...
what do you mean?

41:10.334 --> 41:13.826
He found an algorithm
designed to disrupt

41:13.938 --> 41:15.371
my matrix.

41:15.439 --> 41:17.566
You wouldn't know
anything about that,

41:17.675 --> 41:19.370
would you?

41:19.443 --> 41:23.812
Well, traditional therapy
wasn't getting us anywhere.

41:23.881 --> 41:27.544
Well, your little scheme worked.

41:27.618 --> 41:29.347
Dr. Zimmerman has agreed

41:29.420 --> 41:31.445
to the cellular regeneration
procedure.

41:31.522 --> 41:33.422
lt requires
several more treatments,

41:33.491 --> 41:35.982
but l'm optimistic
he'll make a full recovery.

41:48.806 --> 41:51.741
Trying to steal my secrets?

41:51.809 --> 41:54.642
Another one of my hobbies.

41:54.712 --> 41:58.307
l thought l'd take
home a few memories.

41:58.382 --> 41:59.610
You're supposed to be in bed.

41:59.683 --> 42:01.116
l've got work to do.

42:01.218 --> 42:02.150
lt can wait.

42:02.186 --> 42:03.312
Go to bed.

42:03.387 --> 42:05.355
Doctor's orders.

42:06.524 --> 42:08.389
l hope you won't be
coming back next month

42:08.459 --> 42:10.086
to make sure
l'm taking my medicine.

42:10.160 --> 42:11.525
Don't worry.

42:11.595 --> 42:13.893
My Captain's not likely
to authorize another...

42:13.964 --> 42:15.727
house call.

42:15.799 --> 42:17.323
Good.

42:17.434 --> 42:20.870
The next time
she sends a data stream,

42:20.971 --> 42:25.203
you might want
to drop me a line,

42:25.276 --> 42:27.471
let me know how you're doing.

42:27.545 --> 42:29.979
lf you insist.

42:37.788 --> 42:38.777
Ready?

42:49.099 --> 42:50.964
Would you mind?

42:51.135 --> 42:52.227
Not at all.

42:59.877 --> 43:01.276
Smile.
