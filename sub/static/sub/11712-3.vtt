up front about it.

Oh, please.

does it say

10:10.067 --> 10:13.613
"Hi, I'm the sun. I'm hot?"

10:13.613 --> 10:15.865
Hard to argue
with a sentence that begins,

10:15.865 --> 10:18.034
"When the sun meets people."

a large pizza for the game.

when the Mets have a parade?

10:50.983 --> 10:51.901

kind of homophobic.

the game with Brad,

11:09.836 --> 11:12.379

you cancelled.

11:12.379 --> 11:14.882
Not because he was gay.

11:14.882 --> 11:15.883

If I watched with a French guy,

11:23.307 --> 11:24.851

we're gonna be buddies.

not complain about women?

18:56.135 --> 19:00.013
Why don't you write all these
down and I'll get back to you?

19:00.013 --> 19:01.056
Oh, excuse me,

19:01.056 --> 19:03.809
can I get a vanilla sundae,
no nuts, please? Thank you.

19:03.809 --> 19:06.770
Wow. No nuts is right,
Sea Breeze.

19:06.770 --> 19:09.981
Yeah, try not to spill
any on your panties.

19:09.981 --> 19:11.567
Hey, I switched back
to beer.

19:11.567 --> 19:14.153
Yeah, after
the white wine spritzer.

19:14.153 --> 19:14.986
Roger bought that for me.

19:14.986 --> 19:17.989
It would have been rude
not to drink it.

19:18.490 --> 19:21.660
Hey, I got the results
of the DNA test.

19:21.660 --> 19:23.745
Russell, this is Brad,
he's gay.

19:23.745 --> 19:25.747
Brad, this is Russell,
he almost slept

19:25.747 --> 19:27.916
with his own daughter.

19:28.584 --> 19:31.878
And I made you
uncomfortable?

19:33.255 --> 19:35.299
Well? Is she your daughter?

19:35.299 --> 19:38.719
I don't know.
I haven't opened it.

19:38.719 --> 19:39.761
And I'm not going to.

19:39.761 --> 19:41.222
Why not?
RUSSELL: Well,

19:41.222 --> 19:42.598
I don't wanna know
either way.

19:42.598 --> 19:44.015
I mean,
if it is my daughter,

19:44.015 --> 19:45.851
clearly the mom
doesn't want me in her life,

19:45.851 --> 19:47.894
and I have to respect that.
And if she isn't,

19:47.894 --> 19:50.356
I'd just be disappointed.
Thought of having a child

19:50.356 --> 19:51.607
might give some meaning
to my life,

19:51.607 --> 19:54.568
or a sense of purpose--
She's not your daughter.

19:54.568 --> 19:56.820
Gotta go.

20:03.034 --> 20:05.329
So anyway, now that
we're getting married,

20:05.329 --> 20:07.748
I've decided to try
and stop getting heat

20:07.748 --> 20:08.999
from other people.

20:08.999 --> 20:10.417
Oh. Thanks, sweetie.

20:10.417 --> 20:13.670
I only hope I can give you
all the heat you deserve.

20:13.670 --> 20:16.965
I know
you'll try your best.

20:16.965 --> 20:19.635
Here you go, sweetie.

20:22.971 --> 20:26.517
I-I can't turn it off.

20:26.517 --> 20:27.309
Hey.
Hey.

20:27.309 --> 20:30.479
Guess where my evolved,
open-minded husband just was?

20:30.479 --> 20:32.898
Playing basketball
with his new gay friend.

20:32.898 --> 20:33.940
Wow. Is he any good?

20:33.940 --> 20:37.444
Surprisingly,
not a great ball-handler.

20:37.444 --> 20:40.364
Okay. Jeff, no more gay jokes.
JEFF: Okay.

20:40.364 --> 20:42.115
What are you drinking?

20:42.115 --> 20:42.824
Mm.

20:42.824 --> 20:44.660
It's a virgin sea breeze.

20:45.661 --> 20:46.787
Go ahead.
