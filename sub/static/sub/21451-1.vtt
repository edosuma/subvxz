<i>I'm starting my own paper.</i>

01:42.720 --> 01:44.051
<i>I'll show you how it works.</i>

01:51.880 --> 01:53.962
Go faster!

01:54.080 --> 01:55.525
Whoo!

02:04.200 --> 02:05.326
<i>I'll get</i> a <i>job.</i>

02:05.440 --> 02:06.601
<i>We'll buy a house.</i>

02:06.720 --> 02:07.926
<i>Couple of kids.</i>

02:08.039 --> 02:09.644
<i>Don't worry.
I got it all worked out.</i>

02:12.360 --> 02:13.771
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

02:13.880 --> 02:15.689
<i>please welcome
the newest and youngest</i>

02:15.800 --> 02:17.370
<i>addition to the Tribune team,</i>

02:17.480 --> 02:19.403
<i>Lee Strobel.</i>

02:35.040 --> 02:38.044
It is my distinct pleasure
to honor one of our own

02:38.160 --> 02:39.446
for his nationally acclaimed

02:39.560 --> 02:41.210
Ford Pinto investigative series.

02:41.320 --> 02:43.448
<i>Lee, your work has given justice</i>

02:43.600 --> 02:45.170
<i>to families across the country</i>

02:45.280 --> 02:47.248
<i>and peeled back
a corporate cover-up.</i>

02:47.360 --> 02:50.762
So I present you with
the Len H. Small Memorial Award

02:50.880 --> 02:52.882
for community service
journalism.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.604
And congratulations
on your promotion

02:54.720 --> 02:57.803
<i>to Legal Affairs editor!</i>

03:04.680 --> 03:06.409
<i>Thank you, Mr. Cook,</i>

03:06.520 --> 03:08.682
<i>for the award,
for the promotion.</i>

03:08.800 --> 03:10.802
Um...
mostly for the promotion.

03:10.960 --> 03:13.247
- Uh...
- You're welcome.

03:13.360 --> 03:17.524
The only way to truth
is through facts.

03:17.640 --> 03:21.486
Facts are our greatest weapon
against superstition,

03:21.600 --> 03:24.171
against ignorance
and against tyranny.

03:24.280 --> 03:27.045
Now, I learned those words
from my mentor,

03:27.160 --> 03:28.656
- Mr. Ray Nelson, everybody.
- Thank you.

03:28.680 --> 03:30.045
Let's let him hear it, huh?

03:30.160 --> 03:32.128
Huh? His ego needs it.
Bring it on.

03:32.240 --> 03:33.685
That's enough.

03:33.800 --> 03:35.131
Now, you all know Ray.

03:35.240 --> 03:37.129
He's a legend in the business.

03:37.240 --> 03:40.289
But, to me, Ray, you've been
more like a father, so...

03:40.400 --> 03:41.970
thank you.

03:42.080 --> 03:44.651
Thank you. Thank you, son.

03:44.760 --> 03:46.683
Most importantly, uh,
I owe this honor

03:46.800 --> 03:49.770
to my beautiful and very patient

03:49.880 --> 03:52.281
and very pregnant wife, uh...

03:52.400 --> 03:55.961
and to my favorite
little lady, Alison.

03:56.080 --> 03:57.844
I love you both more
than you'll ever know.

03:57.960 --> 03:59.121
- Aw...
- Yes, sweetie?

03:59.240 --> 04:00.616
Now can we eat?

04:02.240 --> 04:04.561
- "Now can we eat, Daddy?"
- Yes!

04:04.720 --> 04:06.643
- Yes!
- I'll drink to that.

04:06.760 --> 04:08.205
- Cheers!
- Thank you.

04:11.920 --> 04:13.456
- What's next?
- I got "pasta."

04:13.480 --> 04:15.323
Ooh. Well, then.

04:15.480 --> 04:17.536
Of course, she finds the
biggest word on here, right?

04:17.560 --> 04:18.685
"Asparagus"?

04:18.800 --> 04:20.767
Wow, that is a big word.

04:20.880 --> 04:23.008
Not for a girl
who's lost a tooth.

04:23.120 --> 04:24.336
- Oh, okay.
- Oh, big girl.

04:24.360 --> 04:25.646
I'm still impressed.

04:25.760 --> 04:27.569
A big girl who didn't
eat her dinner.

04:27.680 --> 04:28.567
- I'm full.
- You're full?

04:28.680 --> 04:29.567
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

04:29.680 --> 04:30.736
Are you gonna tell me

04:30.760 --> 04:31.816
you're hungry when we get home?

04:31.840 --> 04:33.524
All right,
I'm gonna give you dessert

04:33.640 --> 04:35.961
if you eat one more noodle.

04:36.080 --> 04:37.320
- That was easy.
- See?

04:37.440 --> 04:38.930
Just have to bribe her
a little bit.

04:39.040 --> 04:40.485
- Chew it up.
- Mm-hmm.

04:40.600 --> 04:42.409
We done?

04:42.520 --> 04:44.807
- Show me done. -There's still
spaghetti in there.

04:44.920 --> 04:46.320
Swallow that.

04:46.400 --> 04:48.129
Take this. Go.

04:48.240 --> 04:49.730
Good work.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.936
You know, I'm feeling
pretty good about myself.

04:55.960 --> 04:57.016
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

04:57.040 --> 04:58.201
How is that?

04:58.360 --> 05:00.886
I am married
to a published author.

05:02.360 --> 05:03.407
That's very impressive.

05:03.520 --> 05:05.045
- Mm-hmm. Isn't it?
- Mm-hmm.

05:05.200 --> 05:06.440
I'm proud of you.

05:06.560 --> 05:08.688
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

05:09.800 --> 05:11.643
- I love you.
- I love you.

05:11.760 --> 05:13.922
You and only you.

05:15.520 --> 05:17.443
Mm-hmm?
- Sweetie?

05:17.560 --> 05:19.403
Ali, what is it, baby?

05:19.520 --> 05:21.727
- Are you choking?
- I think she's choking.

05:21.880 --> 05:23.405
- Ali, come on, cough.
- Hey, sweetie,

05:23.520 --> 05:25.284
just breathe for Mommy, okay?

05:25.400 --> 05:27.456
- Ali? Please, Lee. -Everybody,
please, just give her...

05:27.480 --> 05:29.448
- give her some space.
- Lee, do something, Lee.

05:29.560 --> 05:31.456
- Ali, I'm right here.
Okay, -Come on, honey, come on.

05:31.480 --> 05:33.296
- Baby, it's gonna be okay.
- Can somebody help us, please?!

05:33.320 --> 05:35.163
Call an ambulance!

05:35.280 --> 05:37.216
- It's okay, baby. I'm right here.
- Look at Daddy, okay?

05:37.240 --> 05:39.447
Okay, breathe for me.
You're gonna be all right.

05:39.560 --> 05:41.449
Baby, I'm
right here. I don't know...

05:41.560 --> 05:42.856
I don't know what...
I don't know what to...

05:42.880 --> 05:44.976
- I love you, sweetheart. Just...
- She can't breathe!

05:45.000 --> 05:47.256
- Hand her to me. Quick, quick.
I'm a nurse. -Ali, please!

05:47.280 --> 05:49.647
- Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.
- Okay, just stay calm.

05:49.760 --> 05:51.205
Come on.
Come on, Ali, cough for me.

05:51.320 --> 05:53.402
- Cough, honey.
- She can't breathe, Lee!

05:53.520 --> 05:54.646
She can't...

06:03.400 --> 06:04.811
Sweetie.

06:04.920 --> 06:06.416
- Cough, baby. Cough, baby.
- Sweetie? Okay...

06:06.440 --> 06:07.616
Okay...

06:09.160 --> 06:10.616
- Just breathe, okay?
- She's coughing.

06:10.640 --> 06:12.080
- She's fine now. She's fine.
- Okay?

06:12.160 --> 06:14.096
- Okay, just breathe.
- Thank you so much.

06:14.120 --> 06:16.168
Thank you, thank you.

06:16.280 --> 06:18.720
- I don't know how to thank you.
- Come here, baby. Come here.

06:18.800 --> 06:20.760
- Thank you so much.
- You don't have to thank me.

06:20.840 --> 06:22.604
I'm a nurse at Mercy Hospital.

06:22.720 --> 06:24.609
She's gonna be fine now.

06:24.720 --> 06:26.484
We're so lucky.

06:26.600 --> 06:28.728
Well, it's not luck.

06:28.840 --> 06:30.410
<i>It's Jesus.</i>

06:30.520 --> 06:32.045
My husband and I were on our way

06:32.200 --> 06:33.645
to another restaurant tonight.

06:33.760 --> 06:36.161
Something told me
I needed to be here.

06:37.360 --> 06:39.010
Wow. Thank you.

06:39.120 --> 06:40.849
Um, Leslie.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.968
Alfie. Alfie Davis.

06:43.080 --> 06:44.081
I'm not gonna forget you.

06:44.200 --> 06:46.441
God bless you.

06:50.240 --> 06:52.163
Just keeping it
interesting, huh?

06:53.840 --> 06:55.729
You keep drinking that.

06:58.160 --> 07:00.527
<i>I can still
have candy, though, right?</i>

07:00.640 --> 07:02.536
<i>We'll</i> have to see about that.

07:02.560 --> 07:03.686
<i>You get some sleep now,</i>

07:03.800 --> 07:05.768
all right, missy?

07:07.200 --> 07:08.929
- Mom?
- Hmm?

07:09.040 --> 07:11.008
Who's Jesus?

07:12.640 --> 07:16.565
Jesus was a man... great man...

07:16.680 --> 07:18.496
And... you know,
we've talked about God, right?

07:18.520 --> 07:20.010
Honey, you know
how Mommy and Daddy

07:20.120 --> 07:21.963
read you stories at night...

07:22.080 --> 07:23.650
You know, the fairy tales
that you like?

07:23.760 --> 07:26.161
So, believing in God

07:26.280 --> 07:28.965
is kind of like that...
It's really nice stories.

07:29.080 --> 07:31.321
But we are atheists.

07:31.440 --> 07:32.885
Atheists don't believe in God.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.729
What do they believe?

07:34.840 --> 07:37.844
Uh, they believe in what's real,

07:37.960 --> 07:41.362
in what we can see,
what we can touch.

07:41.520 --> 07:43.522
Like What?

07:43.640 --> 07:45.961
Oh... like this.

07:49.440 --> 07:52.603
Well, I guess
I'm an atheist, too.

07:52.720 --> 07:56.281
Get some sleep, booger, okay?

07:56.400 --> 07:57.845
Here's Beary.

07:57.960 --> 07:59.803
There you go.

07:59.920 --> 08:01.570
Fudge Pop.

08:01.680 --> 08:04.126
All right, sleep good.
I love you.

08:04.240 --> 08:06.208
Daddy?

08:06.320 --> 08:08.209
- Yes, love?
- Good night.

08:08.320 --> 08:09.606
Good night, baby.

08:12.200 --> 08:13.770
<i>I thought we said we weren't</i>

08:13.880 --> 08:15.006
<i>gonna force anything on her.</i>

08:15.120 --> 08:16.531
She asked.

08:16.680 --> 08:18.728
Right, so as long as
it's what we believe.

08:18.840 --> 08:21.525
Ugh. Are-are we really gonna
go around on this again, Les?

08:21.640 --> 08:23.210
I guess so.

08:23.320 --> 08:25.766
Babe, I...

08:25.880 --> 08:28.884
I am grateful for what
that woman did tonight...

08:29.000 --> 08:30.604
Obviously...

08:30.720 --> 08:32.927
But it was...
it's a coincidence.

08:33.039 --> 08:34.121
It didn't mean anything.

08:34.280 --> 08:35.486
How can you say that?

08:35.600 --> 08:37.000
She was going
to another restaurant,

08:37.039 --> 08:39.121
and something
made her come to ours.

08:39.240 --> 08:40.924
You think that means nothing?

08:41.080 --> 08:42.730
I know it means nothing.

08:44.200 --> 08:45.531
Can I tell you what it means?

08:45.640 --> 08:47.688
It means that we
would've lost Alison.

08:47.800 --> 08:50.451
If that woman hadn't been
there, we would've lost her.

08:50.560 --> 08:52.369
Our whole world
would've changed forever.

08:52.480 --> 08:54.926
I... Yes, but it didn't.

08:55.040 --> 08:56.849
Okay?

08:56.960 --> 08:58.166
We're all okay.

08:58.280 --> 08:59.850
Everyone's okay.

09:10.960 --> 09:12.610
There you go. I got ya. Whoa.

09:16.800 --> 09:18.325
Hey, chief.

09:18.440 --> 09:20.886
I could've edited three pieces
with my red pencil

09:21.000 --> 09:23.207
in the time it takes me
to do one piece

09:23.320 --> 09:24.526
on this ridiculous thing.

09:24.640 --> 09:25.880
My new book.

09:26.040 --> 09:27.256
Just picked these up
from the mailroom.

09:27.280 --> 09:28.720
Wanted you to be
the first to see it.

09:29.760 --> 09:31.171
Hmm.

09:31.280 --> 09:32.936
Hey, there was a cop shooting
this weekend.

09:32.960 --> 09:34.405
Englewood. Officer survived.

09:34.520 --> 09:37.524
See what you can get me
on the shooter, James Hicks.

09:37.680 --> 09:39.364
No, that's cop beat.
I'm Legal Affairs now.

09:39.480 --> 09:41.164
Why don't you give that
to Monroe?

09:41.280 --> 09:42.611
Now, you may be

09:42.720 --> 09:44.722
a golden boy
to the suits upstairs,

09:44.840 --> 09:47.286
but to me you're still just
a beat reporter here.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.843
Thank you.

09:52.960 --> 09:54.883
Uh, don't close the...

09:55.000 --> 09:57.241
London. Hey.

09:57.360 --> 09:59.806
Want an autographed copy
of my new book?

09:59.920 --> 10:01.888
- Not one bit.
- Ooh.

10:04.560 --> 10:06.562
Jealousy doesn't look good
on you, my friend.

10:06.680 --> 10:08.170
Then again, nothing does.

10:08.280 --> 10:10.408
Overnight legal briefs
from AP, Mr. Strobel.

10:10.520 --> 10:12.761
Thanks, Rod. Hey.

10:12.920 --> 10:14.809
Want you to go through
yesterday's local rags.

10:14.920 --> 10:16.763
See if anyone reported
on a cop shooting.

10:16.880 --> 10:19.531
Perp's name is Hicks...
James Hicks.

10:19.680 --> 10:21.091
Hicks. James Hicks. Sure.

10:21.200 --> 10:23.123
- Okay.
- You got 30 minutes.

10:23.240 --> 10:26.050
I'll take a book
if you're still offering.

10:27.120 --> 10:28.120
Hey, London.

10:28.200 --> 10:29.611
Hear that? Got my first taker.

10:29.720 --> 10:31.563
He doesn't know any better.

10:31.680 --> 10:33.536
Bet you're gonna go far
in this business, kid.

10:33.560 --> 10:34.766
Even if you are sucking up.

10:34.880 --> 10:37.645
29 minutes, Rod.

10:40.200 --> 10:43.204
<i>Room 241, bed two,
going home today.</i>

10:43.320 --> 10:45.084
Want to prep
for discharge, please?

10:47.000 --> 10:48.047
Leslie?

10:48.160 --> 10:49.400
Yes. Hi.

10:49.520 --> 10:51.807
Alfie. Yes.

10:51.960 --> 10:53.849
Um... muffins.

10:56.520 --> 11:01.287
I have not... been able
to stop thinking about it.

11:03.480 --> 11:05.562
What if you hadn't been there?

11:05.680 --> 11:08.411
There is no "what if" with God.

11:09.680 --> 11:11.489
You're so sure.

11:13.560 --> 11:15.210
How can you be so sure?

11:15.360 --> 11:17.727
Do you really want
an answer to that?

11:21.120 --> 11:22.929
Please.

11:26.640 --> 11:28.324
- Alfie. So sorry.
- Ah!

11:28.440 --> 11:30.010
I'm sorry. The babysitter.

11:30.120 --> 11:32.088
- I'm-I'm sorry.
- Oh, it's fine.

11:32.200 --> 11:34.521
- Okay. Okay.
- Come on. Come on in.

11:51.160 --> 11:53.640
Sometimes God speaks
to us in unexpected

11:53.760 --> 11:55.046
and surprising ways.

11:55.160 --> 11:56.810
So tonight, for example,

11:56.920 --> 11:59.127
if you find yourself here
for the first time,

11:59.280 --> 12:02.045
I just want to encourage you
to open your heart

12:02.200 --> 12:03.804
and take a chance.

12:03.920 --> 12:06.764
Maybe God's trying to get
your attention right now.

12:06.880 --> 12:09.565
And, trust me,
if you listen expectantly

12:09.680 --> 12:13.480
for His whispers,
you'll hear them.

12:13.600 --> 12:14.487
You Will.

12:14.600 --> 12:15.726
Maybe you're afraid.

12:15.880 --> 12:17.405
Maybe you have doubts.

12:17.520 --> 12:19.841
Maybe you've felt something
missing in your life

12:19.960 --> 12:22.725
and you don't know quite
what it is.

12:22.840 --> 12:23.966
That's fine.

12:24.080 --> 12:25.525
God is patient.

12:25.680 --> 12:28.570
And when you're ready,
I promise you,

12:28.680 --> 12:32.480
He'll be right there waiting
for you with open arms.

12:36.240 --> 12:37.810
- Hey.
- Hi.

12:37.920 --> 12:39.445
Sorry I missed dinner.

12:39.560 --> 12:40.971
New boss piling on the work.

12:41.080 --> 12:43.447
I think he's punishing me
for the award.

12:43.560 --> 12:45.449
How was your day?

12:48.040 --> 12:49.769
Good.

12:49.880 --> 12:51.484
It was good.

12:59.720 --> 13:01.961
Officer Koblinsky.

13:02.080 --> 13:03.923
- Who are you?
- Lee Strobel.

13:04.040 --> 13:06.042
<i>I'm</i> with <i>the Chicago Tribune.</i>

13:06.160 --> 13:07.810
Close call, huh?

13:07.920 --> 13:10.605
So, I'm looking to do a story
on the shooting.

13:10.720 --> 13:12.131
You know, hero cop,

13:12.240 --> 13:14.049
injured in the line of duty,
that whole angle.

13:14.160 --> 13:16.016
I'm not supposed to talk
to anybody from the press.

13:16.040 --> 13:18.646
I know, but you've gotta
be able to give me something.

13:18.760 --> 13:21.001
You know the deal. Not while
it's under investigation.

13:21.120 --> 13:22.770
Look, I read your report.

13:22.880 --> 13:24.848
I know you and James Hicks
got in a scuffle,

13:24.960 --> 13:26.962
I know he shot you, but come on.

13:27.080 --> 13:28.576
Give me a little something
off the record?

13:28.600 --> 13:31.171
Why do you think he did it, huh?

13:31.280 --> 13:32.691
Look, thanks anyway, okay?

13:32.800 --> 13:34.131
Ah...

13:34.240 --> 13:36.004
All right.

13:36.120 --> 13:40.364
I will go find another hero cop
to interview.

13:40.480 --> 13:43.245
Mr. Strobel,
do you want a story?

13:43.360 --> 13:44.691
Yeah.

13:44.840 --> 13:48.686
Do one on the gangbanger
who did this.

13:48.800 --> 13:50.768
Put him away for good.

13:53.840 --> 13:55.842
Feel better, huh?

13:59.600 --> 14:01.602
<i>We find the answer right here</i>

14:01.720 --> 14:04.007
in the Book of John,
chapter one, verse 12,

14:04.120 --> 14:06.009
"But as many as received Him,

14:06.120 --> 14:09.010
"to them He gave the right
to become children of God,

14:09.160 --> 14:11.970
to those who believe
in His name."

14:12.120 --> 14:16.762
So, what does it mean to
not just believe but receive?

14:16.880 --> 14:18.216
<i>And how does it lead us...</i>

14:18.240 --> 14:20.049
So, did you ever go to church?

14:20.160 --> 14:22.322
Yeah, I went
to church as a girl.

14:22.440 --> 14:23.441
Mm-hmm.

14:23.560 --> 14:27.246
And my mom sung hymns to me.

14:27.360 --> 14:30.807
But Lee and I moved on
from how we were raised.

14:30.920 --> 14:35.244
And, uh, what is it
that Lee believes in again?

14:35.360 --> 14:36.725
Just the facts.

14:36.840 --> 14:38.046
Okay.

14:38.160 --> 14:41.209
I've always been
kind of curious,

14:41.320 --> 14:43.800
but, uh, lately, you know,

14:43.920 --> 14:47.049
having Alison and now...

14:49.480 --> 14:53.405
It's just starting to seem
more important to know.

14:53.520 --> 14:56.683
And I don't believe
that it was a coincidence

14:56.800 --> 14:59.963
that you came to the
restaurant... I don't... so...

15:02.200 --> 15:03.770
What do I do with that?

15:03.920 --> 15:06.924
What do you think
you should do with it?

15:07.040 --> 15:08.929
I don't know. I've just...

15:12.320 --> 15:16.041
I've just spent most of my life

15:16.160 --> 15:18.606
feeling like God
is a million miles away.

15:18.720 --> 15:21.485
Oh, no, sweetheart.

15:21.600 --> 15:24.729
God is not a million miles away.

15:24.840 --> 15:27.571
He's right here...

15:27.680 --> 15:29.682
right now,

15:29.800 --> 15:33.725
waiting for you to talk to Him.

15:50.320 --> 15:52.368
<i>The TV's all staticky again.</i>

15:52.480 --> 15:54.448
<i>Tried banging on it.
That's not working anymore.</i>

15:54.560 --> 15:56.244
Did you check the roof?

15:56.360 --> 15:58.089
Yeah. The, uh, antenna's fine.

15:58.200 --> 16:00.089
Maybe you should call
the repair guy,

16:00.200 --> 16:02.771
see if he can come by
and take a peek at it tomorrow.

16:02.880 --> 16:04.211
Sure.

16:04.320 --> 16:07.802
Hey, so I went to see Alfie
last week.

16:07.920 --> 16:09.081
Uh...

16:09.200 --> 16:12.488
- Alfie, Alfie, Alfie...
- Alfie, Alfie.

16:12.600 --> 16:14.443
Superwoman
who saved our daughter?

16:14.560 --> 16:16.130
- Right.
- Alfie.

16:16.240 --> 16:19.801
So, uh, she invited me
to her church,

16:19.920 --> 16:21.649
and I went.

16:21.760 --> 16:23.330
Really?

16:23.440 --> 16:26.011
Oh, I would've loved
to have seen that.

16:26.120 --> 16:28.487
Yeah, well, I wanted to go.

16:30.440 --> 16:32.761
Can't we just give it
a break, Les? Okay?

16:32.880 --> 16:34.336
I know you were rattled
the other night.

16:34.360 --> 16:36.176
Are you interested in hearing
me or just condescending?

16:36.200 --> 16:38.646
No, that's not... that's not
what I'm trying to do here.

16:38.760 --> 16:39.921
Okay? Alison's fine, hon.

16:40.040 --> 16:41.724
Let's not go crazy.

16:41.840 --> 16:43.604
I'm not acting crazy.
Am I acting crazy?

16:43.720 --> 16:45.210
It was the wrong choice
of words.

16:45.320 --> 16:46.446
I don't think you're crazy.

16:46.560 --> 16:48.130
I think you're pregnant.

16:48.240 --> 16:49.810
And a little crazy.

16:49.920 --> 16:52.844
And scared, and... I get it.

16:52.960 --> 16:55.770
Do you?
Because I'm not done yet.

16:57.200 --> 16:58.690
Okay.

17:00.200 --> 17:02.407
So, I went to church.

17:02.520 --> 17:05.490
And I don't know exactly
how it happened, but...

17:07.079 --> 17:09.002
I felt something.

17:10.640 --> 17:13.119
And so I went again tonight.

17:13.240 --> 17:16.130
And I know this
is gonna be weird to hear,

17:16.240 --> 17:19.686
because it's weird to say,
but...

17:20.839 --> 17:23.286
<i>I</i> prayed.

17:23.400 --> 17:26.847
So, what are you...
what are you telling me, Les?

17:26.960 --> 17:29.201
I'm saying that...

17:29.360 --> 17:31.010
I talked to Jesus.

17:31.120 --> 17:35.330
I... I told Him
I want Him in my life.

17:36.440 --> 17:37.885
You what?

17:38.000 --> 17:39.286
Why?

17:39.400 --> 17:41.164
- Why would you...?
- Hey, stay with me.

17:41.280 --> 17:43.328
Hon, this is a good thing.

17:43.440 --> 17:45.249
What did this Alfie woman
say to you?

17:45.360 --> 17:46.964
It was my decision.

17:47.080 --> 17:48.525
- Okay?
- I don't accept it.

17:48.640 --> 17:51.041
You don't get to accept it.
I'm not asking.

17:51.160 --> 17:52.856
I'm telling you what happened.

17:52.880 --> 17:54.644
You're not hearing me.

17:54.800 --> 17:56.609
Okay. Listen, hon.

17:56.760 --> 17:58.091
It's me.

17:58.200 --> 17:59.929
This is me talking to you.
It's me.

18:00.040 --> 18:02.566
Honestly, this is something

18:02.680 --> 18:04.648
that I think I've been thinking
for a long time

18:04.760 --> 18:06.171
and I just haven't
been able to...

18:06.280 --> 18:09.090
to say anything
because of who you are.

18:09.200 --> 18:10.850
Oh, are you kidding me, Les?

18:10.960 --> 18:12.610
- I know this is a lot, hon.
- A lot?

18:12.720 --> 18:13.960
A lot? You drop this on me.

18:14.080 --> 18:15.080
What does that even mean?

18:15.160 --> 18:16.400
I don't know what it means,

18:16.520 --> 18:17.920
but I know it's
a good thing for me.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.056
- For us. Yes.
- No. No. Okay.

18:19.080 --> 18:20.570
- Yes.
- Okay, this is not us, Les.

18:20.680 --> 18:22.250
Whatever this is, okay,
it is not us.

18:22.360 --> 18:23.486
You are on your own...

18:23.600 --> 18:25.045
Can you listen to me
and not get mad?

18:25.160 --> 18:26.696
I am listening to you,
and that's the problem,

18:26.720 --> 18:27.976
so if you're serious
about this...

18:28.000 --> 18:29.016
- And I am.
- Okay, well, then I...

18:29.040 --> 18:30.440
then I don't know
what to say to you

18:30.520 --> 18:31.696
- about whatever this is.
- Don't say anything, then.

18:31.720 --> 18:33.200
Just listen to what
I'm trying to say,

18:33.240 --> 18:35.561
because I'm trying to explain
that I felt something

18:35.680 --> 18:37.120
that is maybe more real
than anything

18:37.160 --> 18:39.128
I've ever felt in my life.

18:41.360 --> 18:45.046
More real than anything
you've felt in your life.

18:45.160 --> 18:47.200
- Okay, I'm not trying to compare.
- Got it. Got it.

18:47.240 --> 18:48.296
- I'm...
- No. You know what?

18:48.320 --> 18:49.416
I don't want to hear
any more of this.

18:49.440 --> 18:50.930
- Come on. Hon...
- Okay?

18:51.040 --> 18:52.485
Where are you going?

18:52.600 --> 18:54.364
To file a missing persons
report.

18:54.480 --> 18:56.005
- That's not funny.
- Not meant to be.

19:11.760 --> 19:13.524
Thank you.

20:04.160 --> 20:06.481
I love you, Lee Strobel.

20:08.840 --> 20:11.002
<i>You and only you.</i>

20:28.200 --> 20:31.329
<i>I feel like I can
get through to her before</i>

20:31.440 --> 20:32.736
she gets too deep,
but I remember,

20:32.760 --> 20:34.096
you went through something
like this,

20:34.120 --> 20:35.929
uh, with your daughter...
With Lori, right?

20:36.040 --> 20:38.486
Yes, yes, I did.

20:38.600 --> 20:40.409
It's a conundrum.

20:40.520 --> 20:41.965
You see, in times of crisis,

20:42.080 --> 20:44.242
we humans tend to seek meaning,
don't we?

20:44.360 --> 20:46.681
You've read Bertrand Russell,
of course.

20:46.800 --> 20:48.245
Yeah, of course.

20:48.360 --> 20:51.170
I mean, not since college,
but...

20:51.280 --> 20:53.851
There's no way that Leslie
would read that right now.

20:53.960 --> 20:55.883
Yeah, my daughter wouldn't,
either,

20:56.000 --> 20:58.480
but I kept picking away
at the delusion

20:58.600 --> 21:01.126
until she finally came around.

21:01.280 --> 21:04.124
But I gotta tell you, Lee,

21:04.280 --> 21:06.442
doesn't come without a price.

21:07.520 --> 21:08.760
How do you mean?

21:08.880 --> 21:10.450
Whatever this is for Leslie,

21:10.560 --> 21:12.767
maybe it's not
such a terrible thing.

21:12.880 --> 21:16.043
I mean, if it
brings her comfort,

21:16.160 --> 21:18.561
are you sure it's not something
you can live with?

21:18.680 --> 21:20.125
Yes, I'm sure.
I'm not gonna lose

21:20.240 --> 21:21.969
my wife and my kids
to some thing

21:22.080 --> 21:24.447
that I can't even
reason with. No.

21:24.560 --> 21:26.767
I can't even pretend
to go along with this, Ray.

21:26.880 --> 21:29.008
I mean, you of all people
should understand that.

21:29.120 --> 21:30.485
I do.

21:30.640 --> 21:33.041
And I know that Leslie
is a reasonable woman,

21:33.160 --> 21:36.801
so I think that reason
is probably the best approach.

21:36.920 --> 21:41.608
And, as always, it comes down
to facts and truth.

21:41.720 --> 21:45.645
Now, you present her
with the facts,

21:45.760 --> 21:49.606
and I'm sure she will find
her way back to the truth.

21:49.720 --> 21:52.007
Meanwhile, my collection
is at your disposal.

21:52.160 --> 21:53.241
Take your time.

21:53.360 --> 21:54.521
Appreciate it, Ray.

21:54.640 --> 21:56.529
Oh, Lee, one more thing.

21:57.680 --> 21:58.966
I'll be praying for you.

21:59.080 --> 22:00.844
That's not even funny.

22:03.480 --> 22:05.562
<i>Kenny, let me ask you something.</i>

22:05.720 --> 22:08.371
Uh, you're into all this
God nonsense.

22:08.480 --> 22:11.131
Wow, you sure know how
to charm a source.

22:11.240 --> 22:13.641
So, a bunch of Bible thumpers
got to Leslie.

22:13.760 --> 22:15.410
Um...

22:15.560 --> 22:16.891
I'm afraid she joined your cult.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.048
So, if somebody...
somebody wanted to do

22:19.160 --> 22:20.969
an investigation
into Christianity...

22:21.080 --> 22:22.366
Oh, like a hit piece.

22:22.480 --> 22:24.289
Well, uh...

22:24.400 --> 22:27.529
you know, if that's
where the evidence leads.

22:29.360 --> 22:31.567
Seems to me you got yourself
a catch-22.

22:31.680 --> 22:32.920
What's that?

22:33.080 --> 22:34.684
Let's say you debunk
Christianity.

22:34.800 --> 22:36.768
How's Leslie gonna live
with the man who destroyed

22:36.880 --> 22:39.247
the very thing that now
gives her life meaning?

22:39.360 --> 22:41.120
I...
Because I should be the thing

22:41.160 --> 22:42.491
that gives her life meaning.

22:42.600 --> 22:44.409
And then what if Leslie's right

22:44.520 --> 22:47.330
and you prove your theory
of science and reason wrong?

22:47.440 --> 22:49.727
How are you gonna live
with yourself?

22:49.840 --> 22:52.320
I'm willing to take that chance.

22:52.440 --> 22:54.681
Okay. You're a journalist.

22:54.800 --> 22:57.007
Check it out.

23:01.400 --> 23:03.004
Where would you start?

23:03.120 --> 23:04.724
Unless you want to do two years

23:04.840 --> 23:07.366
of seminary, I'd say go
straight for the jugular.

23:07.480 --> 23:08.686
The entire Christian faith

23:08.800 --> 23:10.404
hinges on the resurrection
of Jesus.

23:10.520 --> 23:12.200
If it didn't happen,
it's a house of cards.

23:12.240 --> 23:15.289
He's reduced to
a misunderstood rabbi at best.

23:15.400 --> 23:18.051
At worst, he's a lunatic
who was martyred.

23:18.160 --> 23:20.731
For a guy who thinks I'm trying
to assassinate Christianity,

23:20.840 --> 23:22.808
you sure you want
to hand me that gun?

23:22.960 --> 23:24.530
I'm pretty sure
you're not gonna be able

23:24.640 --> 23:26.483
- to pull the trigger.
- All right.

23:26.600 --> 23:29.046
Who's the big authority
on the Resurrection?

23:32.800 --> 23:34.689
Dr. Gary Habermas.

23:34.800 --> 23:36.211
He debated Antony Flew.

23:36.320 --> 23:37.810
That guy's one of my heroes.

23:37.920 --> 23:39.809
He's in Wisconsin, by the way.

23:39.920 --> 23:41.126
Big debate this weekend.

23:41.240 --> 23:42.480
- Wisconsin?
- Mm-hmm.

23:42.600 --> 23:43.840
Who would go to Wisconsin?

23:50.120 --> 23:51.616
Spike in gang violence,

23:51.640 --> 23:53.847
especially in the communities
of Wrigleyville,

23:53.960 --> 23:55.803
Lincoln Park, and Englewood,
as evidenced...

23:55.920 --> 23:58.969
Dr. Habermas,
if Christians want to hold on

23:59.120 --> 24:02.681
to their belief in a giant
cosmic imaginary friend...

24:02.800 --> 24:04.802
that's all well and good,

24:04.960 --> 24:08.169
but don't try to stand
your historical technique

24:08.280 --> 24:12.171
up against a tsunami
of legitimate scholarship.

24:12.280 --> 24:15.124
You will drown.

24:15.240 --> 24:17.447
Well, thank you
for the warning, Dr. Singer,

24:17.600 --> 24:20.444
but are you not aware
that Gerd Ludemann,

24:20.600 --> 24:22.204
one of the most famous atheist

24:22.320 --> 24:24.243
New Testament scholars,
now believes

24:24.400 --> 24:26.482
that the earliest known report
of the Resurrection

24:26.600 --> 24:29.444
was formed no more than
three years after the Cross?

24:29.560 --> 24:32.086
Now, these are your colleagues,
sir, not mine.

24:32.240 --> 24:35.369
<i>Something you'd like
to ask me, Mr. Strobel?</i>

24:35.480 --> 24:37.050
Yeah, well, I-l...
so I read your book,

24:37.200 --> 24:39.009
and there's something
that stuck out to me.

24:39.160 --> 24:41.481
How can anyone talk about

24:41.600 --> 24:43.170
historical evidence
for the Resurrection

24:43.280 --> 24:46.363
when the Resurrection,
by nature, is a miracle?

24:46.480 --> 24:49.051
Right? We all know miracles
can't be proven scientifically.

24:49.160 --> 24:50.924
Correct, but we don't have
to prove a miracle

24:51.040 --> 24:52.565
to prove a resurrection.

24:52.720 --> 24:54.848
Okay. Love to
hear you explain that one.

24:54.960 --> 24:56.849
No, you just have to show
that Jesus died

24:56.960 --> 24:58.724
and he was seen afterwards.

24:58.840 --> 25:00.365
Right, but the very people
who claim

25:00.480 --> 25:02.562
that they saw him
are religious zealots.

25:02.680 --> 25:05.286
So, in my line of work,
we call those "biased sources."

25:05.440 --> 25:08.011
Well, I'm not interested
in bias either, Mr. Strobel.

25:08.120 --> 25:10.487
You see, I care about the facts

25:10.600 --> 25:12.648
for professional
and-and personal reasons.

25:12.760 --> 25:16.242
Right, so where are the facts,
Dr. Habermas?

25:16.360 --> 25:19.250
The Resurrection narrative is
more legend than it is history.

25:19.360 --> 25:22.569
Really? Well, not according
to historical records.

25:22.680 --> 25:25.331
Did you know that we have
a report of the Resurrection

25:25.440 --> 25:27.727
with specific eyewitnesses
that dates all the way back

25:27.880 --> 25:29.530
within months
of the Resurrection itself?

25:29.640 --> 25:32.803
That source also adds
that 500 separate people

25:32.920 --> 25:34.763
saw Jesus at the same time.

25:34.880 --> 25:36.803
We're not talking decades
or centuries

25:36.920 --> 25:39.287
after the Cross, Mr. Strobel.

25:39.400 --> 25:41.368
It's months.

25:41.480 --> 25:43.608
Hey, you a coffee drinker?

25:46.040 --> 25:48.008
Uh, sure.

25:51.760 --> 25:54.525
I should be able
to reach the faucet.

25:54.640 --> 25:56.404
When am I gonna be taller?

25:56.520 --> 25:58.602
Before you know it.

26:00.640 --> 26:03.166
- Ooh.
- What's wrong, Mommy?

26:07.080 --> 26:09.048
Nothing's wrong.

26:10.480 --> 26:13.689
It's just the little one
saying hello.

26:16.960 --> 26:18.689
<i>Okay, so 500 witnesses,</i>

26:18.800 --> 26:22.168
but that's still just one
historical source: the Bible.

26:22.280 --> 26:24.726
Wrong. There are at least nine
ancient sources

26:24.840 --> 26:27.081
both inside and outside
the Bible

26:27.200 --> 26:29.248
confirming that disciples
and others

26:29.400 --> 26:32.165
encountered Jesus
after the Crucifixion.

26:32.280 --> 26:34.040
But-but they were already
followers of Jesus.

26:34.120 --> 26:35.281
Well, not all of them.

26:35.400 --> 26:37.243
Think of Saul of Tarsus.

26:37.360 --> 26:39.488
He originally was a persecutor
of Christians.

26:39.600 --> 26:41.807
He hunted them down
and killed them.

26:41.920 --> 26:44.571
Yet he died the Apostle Paul,

26:44.680 --> 26:47.445
proclaiming that Jesus
was the Son of God.

26:47.560 --> 26:49.449
But-but let's not
kid ourselves here.

26:49.560 --> 26:52.131
People die for lies
all the time.

26:52.240 --> 26:55.050
900 people died drinking
poison Kool-Aid at Jonestown.

26:55.160 --> 26:57.128
True, and there are
other examples like that

26:57.240 --> 26:59.607
throughout history,
but here's the difference.

26:59.760 --> 27:01.489
People don't
willingly drink poison

27:01.640 --> 27:03.722
for something
that they know is a lie.

27:05.240 --> 27:06.366
Fair point.

27:06.520 --> 27:07.851
If the early Church martyrs

27:07.960 --> 27:10.281
knew that the Resurrection
was a hoax,

27:10.440 --> 27:13.171
then why would they
willingly die for it?

27:13.280 --> 27:15.328
- Would you?
- Um, I want to go back

27:15.440 --> 27:16.885
to something
that you said earlier.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.810
You said that, uh...
that this was personal to you.

27:19.920 --> 27:21.490
Why is that?

27:22.760 --> 27:24.364
I lost my wife Debbie to cancer.

27:24.480 --> 27:26.209
I'm sorry about that.

27:26.320 --> 27:29.403
It was the worst thing
that will ever happen to me.

27:30.840 --> 27:32.569
But in my time of loss, it...

27:32.680 --> 27:35.650
it made me confront my beliefs.

27:35.760 --> 27:38.286
That is where I found
my true comfort.

27:38.400 --> 27:43.486
Because I know that I am gonna
see my wife again someday.

27:43.640 --> 27:47.406
And... forgive me,
but as a man who...

27:47.560 --> 27:51.246
who claims to value
hard evidence,

27:51.360 --> 27:53.522
don't you find
that that sort of, um,

27:53.640 --> 27:57.122
hopeful thinking
weakens your argument?

27:57.240 --> 27:59.891
Not one bit.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.843
The fact that I benefit
from gravity

28:01.960 --> 28:04.088
isn't proof that it's real,

28:04.240 --> 28:06.447
just as my dislike
for mosquitoes

28:06.560 --> 28:10.042
isn't an argument
against their existence.

28:10.160 --> 28:14.404
You see, what I... what I want
and what I don't want

28:14.520 --> 28:16.045
has no impact on truth.

28:16.160 --> 28:18.925
That being said,
if Christ's resurrection means

28:19.040 --> 28:20.565
that I get to be
with Debbie again,

28:20.680 --> 28:23.445
I have no problem
being happy about that.

28:23.560 --> 28:27.804
Sometimes truth reminds us
of what's really important.

29:09.680 --> 29:12.729
Oh, Lee, Lee. Lee.

29:12.840 --> 29:14.001
Alfie. Remember me?

29:14.120 --> 29:15.320
Yeah, of course.
What happened?

29:15.440 --> 29:16.771
Okay, well, her water broke.

29:16.880 --> 29:18.484
She couldn't reach you,
so she called me,

29:18.600 --> 29:20.329
and... well, I drove her here.

29:20.440 --> 29:21.965
Again... thank you.

29:22.080 --> 29:23.445
<i>- I'll</i> take it from here.
- Okay.

29:24.680 --> 29:25.966
- Hey, Les.
- Lee.

29:26.080 --> 29:28.321
- Daddy.
- Hey, peanut.

29:28.440 --> 29:30.169
You a big helper for Mama?

29:30.280 --> 29:31.884
Lee, where were you?

29:32.040 --> 29:33.896
- I was working, hon. -Hon,
I paged you and I paged you

29:33.920 --> 29:36.127
- and I paged you and I...
- I know, I know. Okay?

29:36.240 --> 29:37.366
Yeah.

29:37.480 --> 29:39.130
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm.

29:39.240 --> 29:40.651
He's beautiful.

29:40.760 --> 29:41.760
They're cleaning him up.

29:41.800 --> 29:42.800
We were at home,

29:42.840 --> 29:45.127
and I started cramping, and...

29:45.240 --> 29:47.163
Ali was scared. Right?

29:47.280 --> 29:50.682
And we prayed,
and everything got better.

29:52.480 --> 29:54.050
Good. I'm glad.

29:59.120 --> 30:02.124
- Oh...
- Oh, hi, sweetie.

30:02.240 --> 30:04.129
Hey, come here, honey.

30:04.280 --> 30:05.964
Oh, hi.

30:06.080 --> 30:09.527
Oh, he's got healthy lungs.

30:09.640 --> 30:11.961
Meet your son, Kyle Christopher.

30:12.120 --> 30:15.010
- Hey.
- Hi.

30:17.600 --> 30:18.647
Hey.

30:18.760 --> 30:21.161
Welcome to the world, buddy.

30:42.560 --> 30:45.166
You should call your parents,
don't you think?

30:51.640 --> 30:54.007
People can change, you know?

30:59.000 --> 31:01.162
Well, the announcement's
in the paper.

31:01.280 --> 31:04.363
They can read it
just like everybody else.

32:18.280 --> 32:20.886
Good gracious.

32:53.920 --> 32:55.763
Mr. Marlow.

32:55.880 --> 32:58.008
Lee Strobel, Chicago Tribune.

32:58.160 --> 32:59.844
You'll have to excuse me.

32:59.960 --> 33:01.803
Sir, you've been
dodging my calls

33:01.920 --> 33:03.410
about James Hicks
for over a week.

33:03.520 --> 33:04.851
I tried talking to PD.

33:05.000 --> 33:06.400
They won't tell me anything,
either,

33:06.480 --> 33:08.050
Why can't I get a statement
from anyone?

33:08.160 --> 33:09.321
What's the big secret?

33:09.440 --> 33:11.090
Hold this.

33:11.200 --> 33:14.921
Tell you what...
Why don't you come to the jail

33:15.040 --> 33:17.122
and talk to my client yourself?

33:17.240 --> 33:19.163
Maybe you can get him
to say more to you

33:19.280 --> 33:20.884
than he'll say to me.

33:30.640 --> 33:32.085
Mr. Hicks, I'm Lee Strobel.

33:32.200 --> 33:34.089
<i>I'm</i> with <i>the,</i> uh...
<i>the Chicago Tribune.</i>

33:34.240 --> 33:36.720
I'd like to talk to you
about the shooting.

33:36.840 --> 33:38.888
I figured that maybe you'd want
to give me, uh,

33:39.000 --> 33:44.040
your side of things... you know,
help yourself out a bit here.

33:44.160 --> 33:45.764
I didn't do nothing.

33:45.880 --> 33:48.690
Okay, so then... so then
tell me how it all went down.

33:48.800 --> 33:50.723
I don't know. It's fuzzy.

33:50.880 --> 33:52.600
Joe started shoving me around
for no reason.

33:52.640 --> 33:53.801
Who's Joe?

33:53.920 --> 33:55.763
- Koblinsky.
- The cop.

33:55.880 --> 33:57.211
Koblinsky.

33:57.320 --> 33:59.402
He put his hands on me,

33:59.520 --> 34:02.171
so I fought back,
like anyone would.

34:02.280 --> 34:04.647
We go at it for a bit,
then a gun goes off.

34:04.760 --> 34:06.171
- Whose gun?
- I don't know.

34:06.280 --> 34:08.123
Like I told you,
I was drinking that night.

34:08.239 --> 34:09.889
- It was fuzzy.
- Crime scene report says

34:10.000 --> 34:12.128
they found your .22-caliber
pistol in the bushes,

34:12.239 --> 34:13.400
that it was missing a bullet

34:13.520 --> 34:14.815
and it had your prints
all over it.

34:14.840 --> 34:16.649
Koblinsky carries a .38.

34:16.760 --> 34:18.649
His gun was never fired.

34:18.760 --> 34:21.650
In fact, it was never taken
out of its holster, so...

34:21.760 --> 34:25.525
if you didn't shoot him,
then who did?

34:25.639 --> 34:28.484
My old lady
kicked me out that night.

34:28.600 --> 34:29.965
I got a little crazy,

34:30.080 --> 34:33.447
you know, fired off a round
at the building,

34:33.560 --> 34:36.848
but I didn't aim it
at nobody or hurt nobody.

34:36.960 --> 34:40.487
I tossed my piece in the bushes
when Koblinsky rode up on me.

34:40.639 --> 34:42.847
That's it... he tossed it
in the bushes.

34:42.960 --> 34:44.371
I tossed it in the bushes.

34:47.800 --> 34:49.962
Mr. Hicks,
are you still affiliated

34:50.080 --> 34:52.731
with the Gangster Disciples?

34:52.840 --> 34:54.409
You know what this is?

34:54.520 --> 34:57.285
This is a waste of my time.

34:57.400 --> 34:58.606
Guard.

34:58.720 --> 35:00.722
Sir, I-| am trying
to help you here,

35:00.840 --> 35:02.683
and nothing that you've told me
is gonna change

35:02.800 --> 35:04.176
the evidence
that's stacked against you,

35:04.200 --> 35:06.089
which right now
is pretty overwhelming.

35:06.200 --> 35:08.248
What you talking about?
You don't know me.

35:08.360 --> 35:09.646
Okay, sir,
you gotta come up with

35:09.760 --> 35:11.336
a better excuse
than "the dog ate my bullet"

35:11.360 --> 35:13.886
if you're gonna beat
this thing, Mr. Hicks.

35:16.320 --> 35:17.526
Your client's guilty as sin.

35:17.640 --> 35:20.007
- You know that, right?
- Really?

36:08.560 --> 36:10.085
<i>Father Marquez. Lee Strobel.</i>

36:10.200 --> 36:12.016
<i>- Thank you for seeing me. l...
- Of course. Of course.</i>

36:12.040 --> 36:13.485
I, uh... I should tell you

36:13.600 --> 36:15.443
I'm a bit of a history buff
myself, so...

36:15.560 --> 36:17.767
- Oh. -Yeah, I'm-I'm...
I'm particularly intrigued

36:17.880 --> 36:19.882
with your archaeological work.

36:20.000 --> 36:21.843
Oh. A former life.

36:21.960 --> 36:24.167
Uh, former life, yes.

36:24.280 --> 36:26.965
I'm a... I'm a bit surprised,
given your, uh...

36:27.120 --> 36:29.407
your stellar reputation
that you just

36:29.520 --> 36:32.763
gave all that up for, uh, this.

36:32.880 --> 36:35.360
Well, would you like to be
more specific?

36:35.480 --> 36:37.323
Well, it just seems to me that,

36:37.440 --> 36:39.886
for the better part
of 2,000 years,

36:40.000 --> 36:41.843
Christianity has been
creating these...

36:41.960 --> 36:43.769
these rituals and these rules.

36:43.880 --> 36:46.690
You know, they've erected
these elaborate

36:46.800 --> 36:49.007
and often expensive cathedrals,

36:49.120 --> 36:50.804
and all of that
to support a faith

36:50.920 --> 36:53.844
that I believe
is-is ultimately built on sand.

36:53.960 --> 36:56.725
And yet it's all still standing.

36:56.840 --> 36:59.207
Yes, because people
keep telling each other

36:59.360 --> 37:01.761
the same stories
over and over again.

37:01.880 --> 37:03.245
Just because I write
something down

37:03.360 --> 37:06.011
and I bury it in the dirt,
that doesn't make it true.

37:06.160 --> 37:09.846
I think I'm beginning to see
the crux of your visit.

37:09.960 --> 37:11.883
Look, I...

37:12.040 --> 37:14.930
I understand
that a number of people

37:15.040 --> 37:18.203
claimed to have seen Jesus
after his crucifixion

37:18.320 --> 37:19.890
and some of them
even wrote it down,

37:20.000 --> 37:23.925
How-how can we be sure

37:24.040 --> 37:26.202
of the reliability
of those manuscripts?

37:26.320 --> 37:27.810
Well, the same way
we authenticate

37:27.920 --> 37:30.844
by comparing and contrasting

37:30.960 --> 37:32.450
the copies
that have been recovered.

37:32.600 --> 37:34.648
It's called textual criticism.

37:34.760 --> 37:36.967
The more copies we have,

37:37.080 --> 37:39.401
the better that we can
cross-reference

37:39.520 --> 37:41.966
and figure out if what
the original was saying

37:42.080 --> 37:44.401
is historically accurate.

37:44.520 --> 37:47.569
And the earlier they come from
in history, the better.

37:47.680 --> 37:51.366
Take Homer's "Iliad,"
for example.

37:53.480 --> 37:55.323
MARQUEZ Hmm?

37:55.440 --> 37:57.010
Is this real?

37:57.120 --> 37:59.282
It's as real
as the Macedonian dirt

37:59.400 --> 38:00.925
that I dug it up from.

38:01.040 --> 38:03.486
Well, the Greeks
considered this their Bible

38:03.600 --> 38:05.807
- for many centuries.
- Yes, they did.

38:05.920 --> 38:10.289
That is one of 1,565 copies
in existence today.

38:10.400 --> 38:13.449
Now, the "Iliad"
was originally composed

38:13.600 --> 38:16.001
- 800 years before Christ.
- Okay.

38:16.120 --> 38:20.808
This Greek copy is dated
at the third century A.D.

38:22.240 --> 38:23.480
So...

38:23.600 --> 38:25.682
800... that's-that's...

38:25.800 --> 38:29.521
1,100 years between this copy
and the original, yes?

38:29.640 --> 38:33.929
Correct. There is only one
ancient collection of writings

38:34.080 --> 38:36.447
that has more authenticated
copies than the "lliad."

38:36.560 --> 38:37.971
Can you guess what that is?

38:38.080 --> 38:39.525
You're gonna tell me the Bible.

38:39.640 --> 38:41.085
The New Testament.

38:41.200 --> 38:42.725
And how many copies is that?

38:42.880 --> 38:46.123
To date, archaeologists
have recovered 5,843

38:46.240 --> 38:48.561
Greek New Testament manuscripts.

38:48.720 --> 38:52.008
That's four times as many
as the "lliad."

38:52.120 --> 38:54.964
- Really?
- The earliest fragment

38:55.080 --> 38:59.085
of the Gospel of John
was found in ancient Egypt,

38:59.200 --> 39:01.965
and it dates
to the second century A.D.

39:02.080 --> 39:03.969
How close is that
to the original?

39:04.080 --> 39:06.321
Less than 30 years.

39:06.440 --> 39:10.809
I have one of the fragments
in my collection.

39:10.920 --> 39:12.729
- It's quite a treasure, isn't it?
- Hmm.

39:12.840 --> 39:16.083
After the New Testament
and the "lliad,"

39:16.200 --> 39:17.645
runners-up don't even
come close.

39:17.760 --> 39:19.967
We only have a hundred copies
of Sophocles,

39:20.080 --> 39:22.526
seven copies
of Plato's tetralogies

39:22.640 --> 39:26.042
and only five copies
of anything by Aristotle.

39:26.160 --> 39:30.563
In fact, if you laid the
surviving copies of Aristotle

39:30.720 --> 39:34.406
one on top of the other,
it would make barely four feet.

39:34.520 --> 39:38.002
You do the same with surviving
copies of the New Testament,

39:38.120 --> 39:40.327
the stack would be a mile high.

39:40.480 --> 39:44.201
Nothing else in history
even comes close.

39:44.360 --> 39:46.931
How is that for "reliable"?

39:50.320 --> 39:51.816
Well, Father,
I certainly appreciate it.

39:51.840 --> 39:53.729
You've given me a lot
of food for thought.

39:53.840 --> 39:55.216
Entirely my pleasure.

39:55.240 --> 39:56.571
Oh, wow.

39:56.680 --> 39:57.886
The Shroud of Turin.

39:58.040 --> 39:59.929
That is a fantastic
reproduction.

40:00.080 --> 40:02.242
Uh, the actual shroud
is in the Cathedral

40:02.360 --> 40:04.010
of Saint John the Baptist
in Italy.

40:04.120 --> 40:05.167
Under lock and key.

40:05.280 --> 40:06.611
Of course.

40:06.720 --> 40:08.848
No one's ever proven
if the shroud

40:08.960 --> 40:12.089
is the actual burial cloth
of the Christ,

40:12.200 --> 40:17.366
but whenever someone looks in
those eyes for the first time,

40:17.480 --> 40:20.927
the Galilean who hung
on the cross two millennia ago

40:21.040 --> 40:24.010
suddenly becomes a real person.

40:24.120 --> 40:25.645
But why would he do it?

40:25.760 --> 40:28.240
Why... why allow himself
to be killed

40:28.400 --> 40:31.324
if-if he really is the...
the Son of God?

40:31.440 --> 40:34.011
Why not use his power
to defend himself?

40:34.160 --> 40:35.730
The answer to that
is what got me

40:35.840 --> 40:38.127
out of the dirt
and into the church.

40:38.240 --> 40:40.686
It's really very simple.

40:40.800 --> 40:42.211
Love.

40:42.320 --> 40:44.288
Mm-hmm.

40:47.040 --> 40:48.849

- What you doing?
- Oh, uh...

42:45.120 --> 42:46.770
a little research for a story.

What's your story on?

42:51.360 --> 42:53.283
Oh, the judgment.
Here it comes.

42:53.400 --> 42:55.402
- I'm not judging you.
- Bring it on.

42:55.520 --> 42:57.761
I'm worried, hon, that you've
been up late every night

42:57.880 --> 42:59.291
or out.

42:59.400 --> 43:01.971
I just... I feel like
you're not here with me.

43:02.080 --> 43:04.481
Well, whose fault is that,
Leslie?

43:04.640 --> 43:06.051
Okay.

43:06.160 --> 43:07.764
You've obviously had
one too many.

43:07.880 --> 43:09.962
- You're being a jerk.
- So this is my fault, then?

43:10.080 --> 43:11.411
Sweetheart,

43:11.520 --> 43:14.000
I'm not the one who went
and changed. You did that.

43:14.120 --> 43:15.929
I don't know,
maybe I wasn't enough for you.

43:16.040 --> 43:20.204
Maybe... maybe you had to go
find yourself a new man.

43:20.320 --> 43:22.129
- What?
- Yes.

43:22.240 --> 43:23.571
You're cheating on me.

43:23.680 --> 43:24.681
With Jesus.

43:24.800 --> 43:27.041
You're hilarious.

43:27.160 --> 43:29.200
You went off the deep end,
and now you're pissed off

43:29.280 --> 43:30.611
'cause I won't jump in
after you.

43:31.720 --> 43:32.926
I'm gonna sit this one out.

43:33.040 --> 43:34.371
- All right?
- Great.

43:34.480 --> 43:37.131
I'm going back to sleep.

43:37.240 --> 43:39.527
- I'm gonna crash on the couch.
- Fine.

43:39.640 --> 43:42.007
Hey, I didn't sign up
for this, Les!

43:42.120 --> 43:44.168

44:12.760 --> 44:14.967

44:25.360 --> 44:26.407
You have sweet dreams?

44:26.520 --> 44:27.726
- Mm-hmm.
- Good.

44:34.120 --> 44:36.487
Okay, well, I'll see you later,

Yeah, this is, uh, Bill Craig.

45:08.920 --> 45:10.570
I'm sorry. Who?

45:10.680 --> 45:12.011
Bill Craig.

45:12.120 --> 45:13.576
Dr. Craig, thank you
for returning my call.

45:13.600 --> 45:14.931
I appreciate that.

45:15.040 --> 45:16.565
<i>Yeah, I'm sorry for the delay.</i>

45:16.680 --> 45:18.409
<i>I'm-I'm calling
from Jerusalem.</i>

45:18.520 --> 45:19.856
I have to give a lecture
any minute. I just, uh...

45:19.880 --> 45:21.176
I didn't want
to keep you waiting.

45:21.200 --> 45:22.486
I'll cut right to the chase.

45:22.600 --> 45:23.886
So, I've been doing research

45:24.000 --> 45:25.496
into the purported
resurrection of Jesus,

45:25.520 --> 45:27.488
and I want to run
a theory by you.

45:27.600 --> 45:30.001
Maybe the reason
that the tomb was empty

45:30.160 --> 45:32.527
was because Jesus' body was
never there in the first place.

45:32.640 --> 45:35.325
Because we know that the Romans
used to throw the bodies of...

45:35.440 --> 45:37.681
of, uh, crucifixion subjects
to the dogs.

45:37.800 --> 45:39.564
- Right? -Well, there's
no evidence for that,

45:39.680 --> 45:43.571
but there are specific records
that didn't happen to Jesus.

45:43.680 --> 45:45.520
- And what records are those?
- Well, actually,

45:45.600 --> 45:48.410
the earliest recorded accounts
tell us that Jesus was properly

45:48.520 --> 45:50.329
buried in a tomb...
And the Romans did allow

45:50.440 --> 45:52.966
for burial
of some crucifixion victims.

45:53.080 --> 45:54.976
But then there's something
that still doesn't add up to me

45:55.000 --> 45:57.287
about all of these
supposed eyewitnesses

45:57.440 --> 45:59.488
that claimed to have found
Jesus' empty tomb.

45:59.600 --> 46:01.364
What, the fact that they
were all women?

46:01.480 --> 46:02.776
Yeah, because...
because we know that,

46:02.800 --> 46:04.290
according to Jewish customs,

46:04.400 --> 46:06.641
women were deemed
to be unreliable witnesses.

46:06.760 --> 46:08.489
- Am I right?
- Well, true.

46:08.600 --> 46:11.001
So, why did all four
gospel writers record

46:11.160 --> 46:13.288
that it was women
who discovered the empty tomb?

46:13.400 --> 46:15.448
It...
So I'm asking you that.

46:15.560 --> 46:17.000
Well, if you were
a first-century Jew

46:17.040 --> 46:18.565
making up this story
out of thin air,

46:18.680 --> 46:20.880
then you would never say
that women discovered the tomb.

46:20.960 --> 46:22.928
- It would damage your case,
not help it. -Okay.

46:23.040 --> 46:25.725
So maybe we're dealing with the
world's most inept disciples.

46:25.840 --> 46:27.856
Or maybe the disciples reported
what actually happened

46:27.880 --> 46:29.530
and let the chips fall
where they may.

46:29.680 --> 46:32.206
Okay, all right,
but you-you have to admit here

46:32.320 --> 46:34.243
that there is a...
there is a gaping hole

46:34.360 --> 46:36.203
- in all of this.
- A gaping hole?

46:36.320 --> 46:38.687
The-the fact that the gospels
are filled

46:38.800 --> 46:40.848
with contradictions
about the empty tomb.

46:40.960 --> 46:43.042
Okay? If I turned in a story
that was this jumbled,

46:43.160 --> 46:44.491
I'd be out of a job.

46:44.600 --> 46:46.841
If we look through the gospels,
you start at...

46:46.960 --> 46:49.042
start at Matthew, okay?

46:49.200 --> 46:53.489
Matthew puts Mary Magdalene and
some other Mary at the tomb.

46:53.600 --> 46:56.171
You flip over to Mark,
he adds Salome.

46:56.280 --> 46:58.931
You go to Luke, he adds Mary,
mother of James,

46:59.040 --> 47:00.326
and then some lady named Joanna.

47:00.440 --> 47:02.124
What-what is that?
You need a Sherpa guide

47:02.240 --> 47:03.765
to sort your way
through this mess.

47:03.920 --> 47:05.216
Sure, there are differences,
but that

47:05.240 --> 47:06.520
doesn't trouble most historians.

47:06.560 --> 47:07.846
Why?
Why doesn't that trouble...?

47:07.960 --> 47:09.564
It troubles me.
It should trouble them.

47:09.720 --> 47:12.724
Because the core of the story
is the same in all four.

47:12.840 --> 47:14.604
After Jesus is placed
in the tomb,

47:14.720 --> 47:17.769
it's visited on Sunday morning
by a small group of women,

47:17.880 --> 47:19.291
and they find the body is gone.

47:19.440 --> 47:20.521
Now, you've studied law.

47:20.640 --> 47:22.290
Yeah, law, yes.

47:22.440 --> 47:24.120
Then you know that,
when policemen question

47:24.200 --> 47:26.965
several witnesses at a
crime scene, they never expect

47:27.080 --> 47:28.576
the secondary details
to be consistent,

47:28.600 --> 47:30.807
as long as the core account
is the same.

47:30.920 --> 47:34.129
In fact, if they're
too similar, it's suspect.

47:34.240 --> 47:35.730
- That's true.
- Well, that's exactly

47:35.840 --> 47:37.490
what we're talking about here.

47:37.600 --> 47:39.364
The empty tomb
is based on evidence,

47:39.480 --> 47:41.005
and isn't evidence your trade?

47:41.120 --> 47:43.566
It is, yes, but what if...
what if the Resurrection

47:43.680 --> 47:45.444
is one of the historical details

47:45.560 --> 47:46.925
that was recorded incorrectly?

47:47.040 --> 47:48.804
How can we know?
How can we ever know?

47:48.920 --> 47:50.160
Lee...

47:50.280 --> 47:51.725
let me ask you something.

47:51.840 --> 47:53.729
Do you really want
to know the truth,

47:53.840 --> 47:55.410
or is your mind already made up,

47:55.560 --> 47:57.767
- regardless of the facts?
- Oh, look, Doc,

47:57.880 --> 47:59.325
I-I'm a journalist, okay?

47:59.480 --> 48:01.005
It's my job
to challenge assumptions

48:01.120 --> 48:02.296
until they're proven otherwise.

48:02.320 --> 48:03.401
That's all I'm doing.

48:03.520 --> 48:05.249
Well, I get that.

48:05.400 --> 48:08.210
But when is enough evidence
enough evidence?

48:10.480 --> 48:12.801
He 's <i>so</i> frustrating.

48:12.920 --> 48:14.809
I'm just not good at this,
I guess.

48:14.920 --> 48:17.287
I just...
I want to share it with him.

48:17.400 --> 48:19.641
I want to celebrate it,

48:19.760 --> 48:22.240
and I'm walking on eggshells
in my own home.

48:22.360 --> 48:24.249
Well, it's probably
the same for him.

48:24.360 --> 48:26.442
He's walking
on eggshells, too, so...

48:26.560 --> 48:27.686
give yourself a break.

48:27.840 --> 48:29.365
But the more I try to reach him,

48:29.480 --> 48:31.403
- the more he pulls away.
- Okay, so...

48:31.520 --> 48:33.363
how did you reach him before?

48:34.760 --> 48:37.001
Well, We'd talk.

48:38.880 --> 48:42.282
We'd really talk
and listen and...

48:42.440 --> 48:43.646
"Listen."

48:45.520 --> 48:47.887
Do that.

48:48.000 --> 48:51.004
Easier said than done.

49:03.160 --> 49:04.366
Koblinsky...

49:05.560 --> 49:07.085
Koblinsky.

49:07.200 --> 49:11.250
Koblinsky. Koblinsky.

49:11.360 --> 49:14.409
Koblinsky.
You gotta be kidding me.

49:16.040 --> 49:17.485
<i>Says here that Koblinsky</i>

49:17.640 --> 49:20.405
was Hicks's arresting officer
six times.

49:20.560 --> 49:22.050
Obviously, these guys
knew each other.

49:22.160 --> 49:24.481
In fact, when I interviewed
Hicks, he slipped up.

49:24.600 --> 49:26.489
He called Koblinsky
by his first name.

49:26.600 --> 49:28.602
So, what's your theory?

49:28.720 --> 49:30.927
My theory is that Hicks
is an informant

49:31.040 --> 49:34.010
for the gang task force
and Koblinsky is his handler.

49:34.120 --> 49:36.441
Which means a gang member
just shot his own handler

49:36.560 --> 49:39.291
and, for some reason,
Chicago PD's covering it up.

49:39.400 --> 49:42.165
PD's protecting this guy.
He's a cop shooter.

49:44.120 --> 49:48.603
I can't run that unless you
get me a source inside the PD...

49:48.720 --> 49:51.724
Someone to confirm Hicks
is an informant.

49:51.880 --> 49:53.882
Well, I'm gonna need
a little help.

49:58.680 --> 50:00.728
Dinner and drinks only.

50:00.840 --> 50:03.161
Well, drinks at least.

50:03.280 --> 50:04.770
Bring me back a receipt.

50:04.880 --> 50:06.291
And don't close the...

50:06.440 --> 50:08.090
<i>What do you want
from me, Strobe]?</i>

50:08.200 --> 50:10.885
It's an open-and-shut case.
That's all I know.

50:11.000 --> 50:13.128
So, you're...
you're on the gang squad.

50:13.280 --> 50:14.725
That's all you know?

50:14.840 --> 50:16.683
You gotta give me something.

50:22.320 --> 50:23.731
Can... can I get you dinner?

50:23.840 --> 50:25.365
You like steak?

50:27.800 --> 50:29.564
Here's my theory.

50:29.680 --> 50:33.730
Koblinsky's on your team,
and Hicks is your informant.

50:33.880 --> 50:36.486
You think that, uh,

50:36.600 --> 50:38.284
'cause you take down
a big car company

50:38.400 --> 50:39.976
that there's a conspiracy
underneath every rock?

50:40.000 --> 50:41.256
No, don't-don't...
Come on, Acosta,

50:41.280 --> 50:42.691
you know that I'm right.

50:42.800 --> 50:44.086
Koblinsky's a hero, okay?

50:44.200 --> 50:45.611
No one's taking that away
from him.

50:45.720 --> 50:47.324
But his own snitch shoots him,

50:47.480 --> 50:49.562
and your bosses
don't want it getting out.

50:49.680 --> 50:51.776
That doesn't look good for
your new department, politics

50:51.800 --> 50:53.086
or whatever, I get it.

50:53.200 --> 50:55.089
You want to know what I hear?

50:55.200 --> 50:57.328
I hear they're gonna knock
Hicks's time

50:57.440 --> 50:58.805
down to petty time in county.

50:58.920 --> 51:00.570
They're gonna put him back
on the streets.

51:00.680 --> 51:03.001
They're offering Hicks a plea
to keep his mouth shut.

51:03.160 --> 51:04.810
Now, you don't want that.

51:04.920 --> 51:07.366
Now, all I need
to run this story

51:07.480 --> 51:09.608
is one source from the squad.

51:09.720 --> 51:11.961
That way, everybody knows
Hicks is a stoolie,

51:12.080 --> 51:14.321
he goes away for a long time,

51:14.440 --> 51:16.761
and, boom, your task force
is free of cop shooters.

51:16.880 --> 51:19.486
I'm not gonna quote you.
I'm not gonna use your name.

51:19.600 --> 51:21.568
You don't have to go
on the record. Nothing.

51:21.720 --> 51:22.960
How about this?

51:23.080 --> 51:25.560
If I'm even
in the right ballpark,

51:25.680 --> 51:27.364
you leave the tip.

51:27.520 --> 51:28.885
Drop a couple bucks
on the table,

51:29.000 --> 51:30.764
get up, you walk out of here,

51:30.880 --> 51:32.928
I know that I'm safe
to run my story.

51:35.680 --> 51:37.648
I'll do you one better.

51:37.760 --> 51:40.127
I'll pay for the meal.

51:40.280 --> 51:42.487
It was crap anyways.

51:52.000 --> 51:54.924
<i>Now, how confident
are you on this?</i>

51:55.040 --> 51:56.724
<i>Very.</i>

51:59.000 --> 52:00.923
Okay.

52:01.040 --> 52:02.804
Get it to the copy desk.

52:02.920 --> 52:05.366
Front page...
Green Streak edition.

52:05.480 --> 52:07.562
Uh, and d-don't...

52:24.240 --> 52:25.446
Lee?

52:27.680 --> 52:29.205
Lee?

52:31.480 --> 52:33.562
Hey.

52:34.720 --> 52:35.960
I made you coffee.

52:37.960 --> 52:39.086
Oh, okay.

52:39.200 --> 52:41.567
Shut up and take the coffee.

52:41.720 --> 52:43.449
Goodness.

52:53.200 --> 52:55.965
- I wanted to ask you a favor.
- Mm-hmm.

52:56.080 --> 53:00.483
Uh, the... I'm taking the kids
to church.

53:00.600 --> 53:02.762
Come with us.

53:02.880 --> 53:04.609
Why would I do that?

53:04.720 --> 53:09.886
Because I asked you to...
Nicely... and...

53:11.720 --> 53:13.696
because, even though
you think I've lost my mind,

53:13.720 --> 53:15.370
you'd still do anything
to make me happy.

53:20.640 --> 53:23.803
I'm still gonna bring
my notebook,

53:23.920 --> 53:27.766
in case I uncover
a church scandal or something.

53:27.880 --> 53:29.120
Deal.

53:29.240 --> 53:31.447
Get ready to go.

53:31.600 --> 53:35.047
- 15 minutes.
- Mm-mm.

and I get down so low ♪

53:38.560 --> 53:42.007

53:58.480 --> 54:02.485
Some of you have had bad
experiences in church before,

54:02.600 --> 54:04.648
and I get that.
Churches aren't perfect.

54:04.800 --> 54:07.690
Pastors aren't perfect.
I know I'm not.

54:07.800 --> 54:09.404
But that's not God.

54:09.520 --> 54:11.010
That's people.

54:11.120 --> 54:13.726
God wants to be your Father.

54:13.840 --> 54:16.730
To love you until you know
His promise of Heaven.

54:16.840 --> 54:19.844
Because this is
the simple truth of our faith.

54:19.960 --> 54:21.166
God made us.

54:21.320 --> 54:22.810
We messed things up.

54:22.920 --> 54:25.048
Christ paid for our mess,

54:25.160 --> 54:27.481
and all we have to do
is receive Him.

54:27.600 --> 54:29.409
It really is as simple as that.

54:29.520 --> 54:30.806
<i>Hi.</i>

54:30.920 --> 54:32.888
Lee.

54:33.040 --> 54:34.769
- Hey, Lee.
- Hey. Good to see you, Alfie.

54:34.880 --> 54:37.804
Good to see you.
I see you brought the baby.

54:37.960 --> 54:39.564
Yeah, yeah. He's growing up.

54:39.680 --> 54:41.523
Hey, uh, can I talk to you
for a minute?

54:41.640 --> 54:43.130
Um, sure... sure.

54:43.240 --> 54:45.242
Yeah, I-| just wanted to say
that-that...

54:45.360 --> 54:47.966
we are grateful, uh,
for what you did with Alison.

54:48.080 --> 54:50.128
- Oh...
- And-and we owe you.

54:50.240 --> 54:53.562
And... and-and I-I don't
mean that lightly.

54:53.680 --> 54:57.685
But now, this whole thing
with Leslie,

54:57.800 --> 55:00.326
it needs to stop.

55:00.480 --> 55:01.925
I don't understand.

55:02.040 --> 55:03.883
You're-you're putting ideas
in her head.

55:04.000 --> 55:07.243
You're drawing her into...
in this, and...

55:07.360 --> 55:08.856
and-and I know how this works.
I know you folks

55:08.880 --> 55:11.042
have a mandate, okay?
You need to raise money.

55:11.200 --> 55:13.168
You need to get the good news
out and all that.

55:13.280 --> 55:15.806
I'm just letting you know

55:15.920 --> 55:18.491
that you're gonna need to
find someone else to recruit.

55:18.600 --> 55:22.241
Lee, your wife
is not brainwashed.

55:22.360 --> 55:25.682
She's seeking God,
and I'm just trying to help.

55:25.840 --> 55:29.049
She is vulnerable,
and you are taking advantage.

55:29.160 --> 55:31.561
She's my wife, this is our life,

55:31.720 --> 55:33.370
and I want you
to stay out of it.

55:33.480 --> 55:34.606
Now, is that clear?

55:37.800 --> 55:38.847
All right, come on.

55:38.960 --> 55:39.847
- Let's go.
- Well...

55:39.960 --> 55:41.200
anyhow, see you.

55:41.320 --> 55:42.651
- Okay.
- Alison?

55:42.760 --> 55:44.000
Come on, sweetie.

55:44.120 --> 55:46.122
Bye.

56:14.720 --> 56:16.484
Lee.

56:18.040 --> 56:20.168
Dad.

56:20.280 --> 56:22.328
<i>There</i> he is.

56:22.480 --> 56:24.448
Hello, sweetheart.

56:24.560 --> 56:27.882
- Hi. Hi.
- Big guy. Oh, he's so sweet.

56:28.000 --> 56:29.001
Hi, honey.

56:29.120 --> 56:32.203
Oh, Walt,
look at how handsome he is.

56:32.320 --> 56:34.482
- I'll say.
- Oh, he's an angel.

56:34.600 --> 56:36.887
Yeah.

56:39.600 --> 56:41.887
Oh, sweetheart. Oh...

56:42.040 --> 56:44.805
You know what,
it's time for your nap.

56:44.960 --> 56:47.804
Nap time, so...

56:47.920 --> 56:49.410
Okay, honey, there you go.

56:49.520 --> 56:50.680
I love his name.

56:50.800 --> 56:52.564
What's his middle name?

56:52.720 --> 56:54.529
Christopher.
Kyle Christopher.

56:54.680 --> 56:56.728
You didn't use "John"
in his name?

56:56.840 --> 56:58.808
Walter.

56:58.920 --> 57:00.604
Kyle Christopher
is a beautiful name.

57:00.720 --> 57:02.529
It's a beautiful name,
but "John" has been

57:02.640 --> 57:03.936
in the Strobel line
for generations.

57:03.960 --> 57:05.530
Oh, here we go.

57:05.640 --> 57:08.246
Because I didn't want
to name my son John, okay?

57:08.400 --> 57:10.926
Your grandpa's John.
So is your older brother.

57:11.040 --> 57:12.929
Mm-hmm. It's also
the euphemism for a toilet

57:13.040 --> 57:14.280
and the client of a prostitute.

57:14.320 --> 57:15.320
Lee!

57:16.280 --> 57:17.884
Really?

57:18.000 --> 57:20.446
Sorry I brought it up.

57:20.560 --> 57:22.160
Don't know why
you guys came anyway.

57:22.240 --> 57:23.890
Nobody invited you.

57:31.360 --> 57:33.522
I'm gonna get some air.

57:35.680 --> 57:37.489
Leslie, it was lovely
to see you.

57:37.640 --> 57:39.722
- Thanks for coming.
- Thanks.

57:45.960 --> 57:50.090
Lee, was that really necessary?

57:50.200 --> 57:52.168
I learned from the best
of 'em, Mom.

57:52.320 --> 57:54.368
Oh, I just wish
the two of you could learn

57:54.480 --> 57:56.403
- to understand each other.
- Oh, you know what?

57:56.520 --> 57:57.760
I wish a lot of things.

57:57.880 --> 57:59.450
I... What do you want from me?

57:59.560 --> 58:01.688
The guy never cared about me
my whole life.

58:01.800 --> 58:03.165
Now, suddenly, I got kids,

58:03.280 --> 58:05.601
and he wants
to be best friends? No.

58:05.720 --> 58:07.449
It's too late.

58:07.560 --> 58:09.881
Honey, I'm gonna go
do some work.

58:41.000 --> 58:43.765
I'm sorry. I know
it's always hard with him.

58:47.440 --> 58:50.046
That can never happen to us.

58:59.320 --> 59:01.368
<i>Ray, I'm telling you,
I've checked it out.</i>

59:01.480 --> 59:02.811
<i>I've interviewed a dozen</i>

59:02.920 --> 59:04.570
historians, philosophers,
archaeologists.

59:04.680 --> 59:06.489
There's all these accounts

59:06.600 --> 59:09.080
of actual eyewitnesses
which corroborate each other.

59:09.200 --> 59:11.202
People with zero motivation
to lie.

59:11.360 --> 59:12.771
In fact, they should've lied.

59:12.880 --> 59:15.884
Some of them ended up dying
for their beliefs.

59:19.200 --> 59:21.521
I'm losing my mind, Ray.

59:23.360 --> 59:28.082
I wake up every morning,
and, um, I think to myself,

59:28.200 --> 59:29.725
"Maybe today's the day.

59:29.840 --> 59:32.047
Maybe... maybe today
she'll come to her senses."

59:33.680 --> 59:35.250
And she doesn't.

59:35.360 --> 59:37.283
You know, just gets worse.

59:39.480 --> 59:42.165
Thing of it is, she's different.

59:43.800 --> 59:45.723
She's actually different.

59:45.840 --> 59:48.605
You know, that's what scares
the heck out of me.

59:51.400 --> 59:53.164
Just miss my wife.

59:55.880 --> 01:00:00.363
I wish that I could be
of more help to you, Lee.

01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:07.808
But just remember...

01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:15.001
Leslie knows full well that you
don't approve of all this,

01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:17.851
but she is still your wife.

01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:21.847
And you love her very much.

01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:30.843
Just make sure
she knows that, too.

01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:48.646
You're up early.

01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:51.127
Mm-hmm.

01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:53.129
Just"

01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:54.890
enjoying the quiet.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.764
Baby's still sleeping.

01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:05.731
You Okay?

01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:07.171
Yeah.

01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:12.090
Just... feeling grateful.

01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:14.805
<i>For you.</i>

01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:17.371
For us.

01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:19.403
Yeah. Me, too.

01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:25.891
What would you say if we...

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.684
went out tonight?

01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:29.370
Grabbed some dinner.

01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:31.847
Maybe, uh...
maybe a little dancing.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.331
But just you and me.

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:35.568
No kids.

01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:37.284
That be crazy?

01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:38.561
Uh...

01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:40.489
- Little bit?
- Yeah.

01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:42.762
A little bit.

01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:46.208
Let's do it.

01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:48.766
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:52.128
I want to take care of us.

01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:01.166
You and only you.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.729
Yeah.

01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:13.084
<i>Mr. Hicks, do you understand</i>

01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:14.611
<i>the felony charges
that have been</i>

01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:15.960
filed against you?

01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:17.445
Yes, sir.

01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:19.244
How do you plead?

01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:22.085
Guilty, sir.

01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:25.485
This is not the first time

01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:27.364
I've seen you
in my courtroom, son.

01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:29.448
I know you thought
you'd be walking away today

01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:31.369
with a slap on the wrist,

01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:33.960
but with recent information
that's come out in the press,

01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:36.208
well, today you're gonna get
some hard time.

01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:38.209
At my discretion,
I'm sentencing you

01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:40.766
to a minimum of 15 years

01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:42.609
at the Joliet State Prison.

01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:45.291
Bailiff, take him away.

01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:47.687
Mr. Hicks.

01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:49.484
Guilty, huh?

01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:50.896
We're all guilty
of something, reporter,

01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:52.285
but I ain't guilty of this.

01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:54.096
Okay, so then why not
maintain your innocence?

01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:56.168
Why cop a plea?

01:02:56.280 --> 01:02:58.647
Your story didn't give me
no choice, did it?

01:02:58.760 --> 01:03:00.922
Did your story give me a choice?

01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:07.728
Yes, the courtroom was filled
with police officers

01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:09.444
all awaiting the verdict...

01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:11.164
Excuse me.

01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:23.051
- Dubois.
- He pled out, chief.

01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:24.241
15 years.

01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:26.607
I guess your theory
panned out, huh?

01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:28.376
- Yeah. -Yeah, I wouldn't want
to be Hicks, though.

01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:30.687
The guy's now a cop shooter
and a gang informant.

01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:32.325
That's gonna be
one tough stretch.

01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:34.408
- Yep.
- Ten grafs for page one.

01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:35.851
Yeah. Heading back to you.

01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:37.325
All right.

01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:51.571
You know what I was
just thinking?

01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:53.165
Hmm?

01:03:57.040 --> 01:03:58.804
I miss you.

01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:07.842
I'm right here.

01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:11.365
Yeah?

01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:16.404
I wish I could make it
more understandable,

01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:18.090
what I'm going through.

01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:25.090
I feel like I'm on this journey
to the most amazing place

01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:27.407
I've ever been,
and I can't take you.

01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:29.409
I... I-I can't even...

01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:31.329
I don't know how
to tell you about it.

01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:33.090
I'm sorry.

01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:56.130
Look, Les, I...

01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:58.242
I understand...

01:04:58.360 --> 01:05:00.362
that all this
feels good right now.

01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:02.562
I mean, I went to church.
I-l...

01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:05.331
heard the music.

01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:08.728
I get that you want this
to be true.

01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:11.565
But what if it's not?

01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:13.324
Wouldn't you want to know that

01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:16.489
before you've dedicated
your entire life to it?

01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:19.284
Of course.

01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:24.324
But what if it is?

01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:26.005
What if it is true?

01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:27.610
Wouldn't you want to know that?

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:39.209
There's a verse that says...

01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:43.211
faith is the evidence of things
we can't actually see.

01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:49.165
You believe what you can see
and touch and feel,

01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:51.681
and I feel this.

01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:54.491
- I can see it. I-I know it.
- Les...

01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:55.761
You-you can't.

01:05:55.880 --> 01:05:57.564
But I...

01:05:57.720 --> 01:05:59.131
I do.

01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:01.561
It's the same way
I know I love you.

01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:03.216
Yeah, but that's...
that's different, Les.

01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:04.366
I'm real.

01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:05.806
I'm-I'm... l-I'm a person.

01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:07.524
We-we have a relationship.

01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:16.369
Hon, I know we've been
fighting and...

01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:20.530
it's been weird lately, but...

01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:22.529
I...

01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:26.725
I love you more now
than I ever have.

01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:28.808
Based on what?

01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:32.569
"Based on what?"

01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:37.840
Honestly, it's since
I accepted Jesus.

01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:42.405
My love for you

01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:44.881
has only... it's only grown

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.889
and it's only deepened.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:50.288
And if that's not proof
of something,

01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:52.044
I don't know what is...

01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:54.288
No, that's not proof
of anything, Les.

01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:56.801
That's feelings.
It's not proof.

01:06:56.920 --> 01:07:00.003
And my feelings are a valid
experience that-that...

01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:02.606
- Les, I-I...
- They're real to me.

01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:05.529
I-I don't like...

01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:11.091
this version of us.

01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:13.680
I don't... I don't like
what you're becoming.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:20.209
And if I'm looking ahead

01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:21.880
and we're still having
this conversation

01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:24.964
five years from now...

01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:28.004
we're having this conversation
two years from now...

01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:33.450
I don't want to be there
for that.

01:07:33.560 --> 01:07:35.722
Okay? I won't be.

01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:54.848
I'm gonna check on the kids.

01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:05.841
- We can sit here for a minute.
- Okay.

01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:07.176
- Okay. Thank you. Okay.
- Okay.

01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:09.168
Alfie, I'm-I'm losing hope.

01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:10.441
I'm losing hope for Lee.

01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:11.971
I'm losing hope for my marriage.

01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:14.651
Oh, come on, now.
It's gonna be okay.

01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:16.524
- It'll be all right.
- No,

01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:18.336
- I don't know what to do.
- All right, okay.

01:08:18.359 --> 01:08:20.362
I know that it's scary.

01:08:20.479 --> 01:08:22.050
I do. Trust me.

01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:23.725
I've been there.

01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:26.241
But I can promise you this.

01:08:26.359 --> 01:08:29.921
In His time and in His way,

01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:33.448
God always keeps His promises.

01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:36.370
And what did He promise Ezekiel?

01:08:36.479 --> 01:08:40.246
"I will give you a new heart.

01:08:40.359 --> 01:08:43.250
"I will put a new spirit in you.

01:08:43.359 --> 01:08:46.648
"I will remove from you
your heart of stone

01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:51.162
and give you a heart of flesh."

01:08:51.279 --> 01:08:53.567
Now, that's a truth
you already know.

01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:55.045
Yeah.

01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:59.768
But it's the same truth for Lee.

01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:01.404
You just gotta be patient.

01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:02.600
Okay.

01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:03.881
Thank you.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:05.240
- Thank you.
- Oh, come here.

01:09:05.359 --> 01:09:06.805
You're gonna be fine.

01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:09.241
I promise.

01:09:09.359 --> 01:09:13.729
I promise,
I'm praying for both of you.

01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:17.008
Mm-hmm.

01:09:20.359 --> 01:09:22.408
Hey, just because
they said they saw Jesus

01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:24.045
doesn't mean they actually did.

01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:26.640
I'm sorry. Was that for me?

01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:28.376
Maybe the eyewitnesses
to the Resurrection...

01:09:28.399 --> 01:09:30.243
Maybe they're delusional.
You know what I mean?

01:09:30.359 --> 01:09:31.885
Maybe they only thought
they saw Jesus.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.321
Maybe it was, like,
mind control or brainwashing.

01:09:34.479 --> 01:09:35.322
Rod!

01:09:35.479 --> 01:09:37.960
You need to see a psychologist.

01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:39.491
Oh, you think I got
a screw loose?

01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:41.363
Yeah, well,
that's another story.

01:09:41.479 --> 01:09:43.720
But if you're talking about
first-century mass psychosis,

01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:45.450
you need to talk
to a psychologist.

01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:48.211
I'm already ahead of you.
Rod!

01:09:48.319 --> 01:09:49.880
- Hey. I need you to find me...
- Sorry.

01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:51.371
A good psychologist
to interview.

01:09:51.479 --> 01:09:53.015
- A ps-psy...
- Psychologist. That's right.

01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:55.361
A guy with... with a lot
of academic street cred.

01:09:55.480 --> 01:09:57.369
Knows the human mind
better than God does.

01:09:57.480 --> 01:09:58.891
No pressure, kid.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.002
Don't listen to him.

01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:05.402
<i>Dr. Roberta Waters, president</i>

01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:08.410
<i>of the American Association
of Psychoanalysts, agnostic...</i>

01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:10.363
<i>Ah, agnostic. Finally.</i>

01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:12.050
<i>And</i> a <i>leading authority</i>

01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:14.322
<i>on human behavior
at Purdue University.</i>

01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:16.642
Indiana. Great.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:20.729
Dr. Waters.

01:10:20.840 --> 01:10:23.605
Ah. Hello, Mr. Strobel.

01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:25.806
As much as I would like

01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:27.729
to help a fellow skeptic,

01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:31.003
what you're proposing
is completely impossible.

01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:33.083
But how can you say that?

01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:36.170
I mean, if Charles Manson
can turn his followers into...

01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:38.536
murderous zombies, surely the
followers of the Christ cult

01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:40.881
could be convinced
of their own delusions.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.606
Listen, hallucinations
are like dreams.

01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:46.081
They happen in individual minds.

01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:48.362
They don't spread
like the common cold.

01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:51.006
Okay, so... a hypnotist

01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:53.487
turns a stage full
of insurance salesmen into...

01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:55.244
into clucking chickens...
Then that's...

01:10:55.360 --> 01:10:57.362
that's not really
happening or...?

01:10:57.520 --> 01:10:59.409
No, of course it is.

01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:02.205
The power of suggestion
can be very profound.

01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:05.045
But it's one thing
to be mesmerized

01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:07.288
into making animal noises.

01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:09.721
It's quite another
for 500 people

01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:11.888
to have the same dream.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.685
To be honest, that would be
an even bigger miracle

01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:16.609
than the Resurrection itself.

01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:19.405
And without an empty tomb,

01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:22.649
you and I, we're not even
having this conversation.

01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:25.161
If Jesus recovered
from his injuries,

01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:26.884
that solves that problem.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.810
All these people could have
easily seen him, yes?

01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:32.969
Yes, but I'm afraid
that's not a brain issue.

01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:35.651
You need to speak
to a medical doctor.

01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:39.003
Of course.

01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:41.964
Dr. Waters, again,
thank you for your time.

01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:43.844
You've been most gracious.

01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:48.249
Before you go,
may I ask you something?

01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:49.885
Sure.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:51.764
It's about your father.

01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:55.009
I'm just curious
what your relationship

01:11:55.160 --> 01:11:56.571
with him is like.

01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:00.289
Um...

01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:04.689
Complicated.

01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:06.285
Let me guess.

01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:09.051
Distant, cold,
doesn't give much affirmation

01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:10.685
or express love?

01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:13.530
Guilty on all charges.

01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:14.841
Why?

01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:16.689
I imagine, as a skeptic,

01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:20.168
you're familiar with history's
great names in atheism.

01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:22.806
Hume, Nietzsche, Sartre, Freud.

01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:24.968
Of course, yes.
Some of my greatest heroes.

01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:28.050
Did you know that all of them
had a father

01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:29.764
who either died
when they were young,

01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:31.291
abandoned them,

01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:33.767
was physically
or emotionally abusive?

01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:35.325
In the world of therapy,

01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:37.807
it's called a father wound.

01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:42.284
No, I...
I was not aware of that.

01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:45.165
But with all due respect,
Dr. Waters,

01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:47.408
I did not have a loving father,
but that doesn't mean

01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:49.409
that I have a problem
with those who do.

01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:52.569
What I have a problem with
is some made-up loving father.

01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:54.768
If God was real...

01:12:56.320 --> 01:12:59.403
I could accept that He loves me.

01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:02.609
I just don't believe He is.

01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:04.609
I don't disagree.

01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:07.007
Well, unfortunately,

01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:09.088
my wife does.

01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:11.567
The problems that it's
currently causing my marriage

01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:13.011
are very real.

01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:15.009
Again...

01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:16.810
thank you.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:22.604
"I will give you a new heart

01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:24.245
"and put a new spirit in you.

01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:28.611
"I will remove from you
your heart of stone

01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:30.927
and give you a heart of flesh."

01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:36.327
"I will give you a new heart

01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:38.966
"and put a new spirit in you.

01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:42.687
"I will remove from you
your heart of stone

01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:45.326
and give you a heart of flesh."

01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:09.768
Oh, interview...

01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:11.570
Alexander Metherell.

01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:14.610
Found you.

01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:19.205
California.

01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:21.926
Better than Wisconsin.

01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:23.804
Uh, Mr. Strobel?

01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:25.570
- Yeah?
- You have a visitor.

01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:28.047
Hey. Officer Koblinsky.

01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:29.161
How you feeling?

01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:30.691
Eh, getting there.

01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:32.211
Good. Thanks, Rod.

01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:34.931
Just wanted to come by
and, uh, you know,

01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:37.930
say thanks for the story,
for telling the truth.

01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:39.769
Yeah, well, it's my job

01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:41.882
and, uh, in this case,
my pleasure.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:43.365
Yeah.

01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:45.767
So, you got everything
you need on Hicks?

01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:47.405
Wrapping the story up?

01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:49.443
Yeah, well, that's...
that's all done.

01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:52.530
Uh, you don't have to worry
about him shooting anyone

01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:55.883
- for another, uh, 15 years.
Ooh. -Uh,

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:57.729
still have bullet fragments
in my spleen.

01:14:57.840 --> 01:15:00.161
- Ah, right, I forgot.
- Yeah.

01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:02.089
Price for doing my job,
I guess, huh?

01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:04.202
Right.

01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:07.440
- Thanks again, Strobel.
- Yeah. Feel better.

01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:06.488
Not sure why you want
to do this now.

01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:08.045
Hicks has already been
sentenced.

01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:10.527
Just humor me, Marlow.

01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:12.642
<i>And here's what's weird.</i>

01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:13.921
<i>He's got...</i>

01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:16.805
bullet fragments in his spleen,

01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:19.730
but the entry wound is up here.

01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:22.002
It's-it's as if...
it's as if the weapon barrel

01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:23.690
was pointing inside
the breast pocket.

01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:25.496
Yeah, you can see
the powder burns right there.

01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:27.409
Now, a couple years back,

01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:29.176
I was doing research
on concealed weapons.

01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:30.611
People disguising firearms

01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:33.087
as cigarette lighters,
belt buckles.

01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:35.691
That's a pen.

01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:37.484
It's a writing utensil.

01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:38.840
Is it?

01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:47.761
What is that?

01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:50.490
Spent shell casing.

01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:54.525
That, Mr. Marlow, is a gun.

01:16:54.640 --> 01:16:56.642
That is a...

01:16:56.760 --> 01:16:59.604
a .22-caliber pen gun.

01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:01.125
Look at that right there.

01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:03.481
That's what shot Koblinsky.

01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:05.045
This is illegal, for any cop

01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:07.481
to carry a weapon like this
while on duty.

01:17:07.640 --> 01:17:09.051
How could nobody have seen this?

01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:10.924
'Cause nobody
was looking for it.

01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:12.280
Koblinsky had a secret.

01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:14.522
He played the victim card,
and I bought it.

01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:16.642
Well, so did the cops.

01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:18.330
Unbelievable.

01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:19.885
He's actually innocent.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:21.729
He was wrongfully prosecuted,
is what he is.

01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:23.205
You gotta get back
to that judge.

01:17:23.320 --> 01:17:24.765
You gotta get Hicks
out of lockup.

01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:26.120
Can you get this stuff in...

01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:28.925
I got it. I got it.
Just, you go.

01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:31.845
<i>How could you miss this?!</i>

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:33.331
<i>Koblinsky played me.</i>

01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:34.930
No.

01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:38.123
You let yourself get played,
Mr. Best Seller.

01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:40.891
And you put the integrity
of this paper at risk,

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:44.971
not to mention putting
an innocent man in harm's way.

01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:47.447
Whatever's been
distracting you lately,

01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:49.762
it got in the way
of your reporting.

01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:52.645
Now, go write me a retraction.

01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:55.809
I gotta call downstairs
and have them hold the presses

01:17:55.920 --> 01:17:57.968
so we can remake A-1.

01:17:58.080 --> 01:17:59.605
Yes, sir.

01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:04.367
After this, um...

01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:07.165
I'd like to take a few
personal days, if I could.

01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:09.282
Take more than that.

01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:13.243
Get me Production.

01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:18.810
Leslie Strobel,

01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:21.964
today is very much
like a wedding ceremony.

01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:25.846
By taking the step of baptism,
you are publicly proclaiming

01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:27.883
that you are a follower
of Jesus.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.002
Do you believe He is your Savior

01:18:30.120 --> 01:18:31.770
and died for your sins?

01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:34.087
I do.

01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:38.125
And is it your desire
to make that belief public

01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:40.208
b)' being baptized?

01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:41.964
Yes. Yes, it is.

01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:43.844
Then...

01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:46.804
it is my privilege
to baptize you

01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:50.891
in the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:35.130
Thank God.

01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:38.565
Where were you?

01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:43.130
I was just out celebrating
on my own.

01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:45.527
- Okay. -And then I remembered
that I need to go

01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:47.563
to Los Angeles tomorrow,
so I have to pack a bag.

01:19:47.720 --> 01:19:49.245
No, no, no, no.
Los Angeles? No, no.

01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:50.805
What happened today?

01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:52.285
- You left. You left.
- Uh-huh.

01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:54.056
- What happened?
- Well, I didn't want to...

01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:56.526
I didn't want to interrupt
the wedding festivities.

01:19:56.640 --> 01:19:58.768
It's... that's a big deal.
Congrats.

01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:00.564
- It's a metaphor.
- Uh-huh.

01:20:00.680 --> 01:20:02.016
You know what
a metaphor is, right?

01:20:02.040 --> 01:20:03.256
You're a smart guy, Lee, right?

01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:04.856
- Married to Jesus. Yep.
- Hey. Come here.

01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:06.166
Come here. Listen to me.

01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:08.482
Today was important to me.
You know that.

01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:10.250
I don't understand
how you could just...

01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:12.520
- That makes two of us, Leslie.
- Lee, I'm trying here!

01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:14.216
- I know you're trying.
- I'm trying... Hey, listen!

01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:15.605
I know you're trying.

01:20:15.720 --> 01:20:17.484
- I can feel you trying, Leslie.
- Can you?

01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:19.250
I am. I'm trying. I'm tr...

01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:21.249
Behind closed doors
every day, hoping

01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:22.964
- and praying that you can...
- Yeah.

01:20:23.080 --> 01:20:25.367
Fix me up so I'm good enough
for the Almighty.

01:20:25.480 --> 01:20:26.976
- Is that what you want?
- You need to leave.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:28.416
- I'm not gonna go.
- You need to sleep it off.

01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:29.896
- I'm not gonna leave my own house.
- Sleep it off.

01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:31.216
- Sleep it off.
- No. This is my house!

01:20:31.240 --> 01:20:32.376
- I'm not gonna leave!
- Lee, get out!

01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:34.607
- It's my house! It's my family!
- Get out!

01:20:34.720 --> 01:20:36.643
Daddy, stop being mean to Mommy.

01:20:36.760 --> 01:20:38.576
- Alison, what are you doing?
Get upstairs now! -LESLIE: Hey.

01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:40.364
- Keep your voice down!
- Go!

01:20:40.520 --> 01:20:43.330
- -You just go
to California. Just go.

01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:47.041
You and only you, hon, right?!

01:20:52.600 --> 01:20:54.728
You and only you.

01:20:57.280 --> 01:20:59.726
Until something better
comes along.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:18.684
Hi.

01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:23.284
Daddy's sorry.

01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:27.001
Daddy's sorry.

01:21:27.120 --> 01:21:29.088
He didn't mean to scare you.

01:21:32.440 --> 01:21:34.044
Hi.

01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:24.090
<i>Father...</i>

01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:26.567
<i>give Lee a new heart.</i>

01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:28.887
<i>Put a new spirit in him.</i>

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:30.729
Remove from him
his heart of stone

01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:32.848
and give him a heart of flesh.

01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:50.643
<i>So, forgive me for making you</i>

01:22:50.760 --> 01:22:52.603
<i>travel all the way
out here, but...</i>

01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:56.042
when someone rings me up
and says he wants to dispute

01:22:56.200 --> 01:22:58.282
the most significant event
in human history,

01:22:58.400 --> 01:23:00.641
I feel it's important
that we do it face-to-face.

01:23:00.760 --> 01:23:02.171
- Don't you?
- Yeah, that's fine.

01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:04.089
I, uh...
l-| appreciate your time.

01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:07.647
So, my line of attack is this:

01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:09.091
The reason the eyewitnesses

01:23:09.200 --> 01:23:11.851
were able to see Jesus
after Golgotha

01:23:11.960 --> 01:23:14.327
is because he never died
on the cross.

01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:16.480
Because, if he doesn't die,
there's no resurrection.

01:23:16.520 --> 01:23:17.851
- Yes?
- That's right.

01:23:17.960 --> 01:23:20.566
So... so, whether or not
Jesus himself or, uh...

01:23:20.720 --> 01:23:22.560
or someone else took him off
of the cross early

01:23:22.600 --> 01:23:25.126
or if he fakes his
own death, it doesn't matter.

01:23:25.240 --> 01:23:27.481
It completely discounts every
aspect of the Resurrection.

01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:28.965
Right. The swoon theory.

01:23:29.080 --> 01:23:30.969
Yeah, well, he passed out.
He didn't die.

01:23:31.080 --> 01:23:33.447
I'm afraid there's a long line
of skeptics in front of you

01:23:33.560 --> 01:23:34.891
with that hypothesis.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.480
Including only a billion
Muslims the world over

01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:39.841
who also don't believe
that Jesus died on the cross

01:23:39.960 --> 01:23:41.166
because the Koran says so.

01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:43.408
With all due respect to Islam,

01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:45.807
the Koran was written
six centuries after Christ.

01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:47.331
I prefer my historical sources

01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:49.056
- a bit closer to actual events, yeah?
- I understand.

01:23:49.080 --> 01:23:51.082
But-but you concede
that it's possible.

01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:56.481
Mr. Strobel, I am a medical
doctor and a scientist.

01:23:56.600 --> 01:23:58.489
I have seen a great many
strange phenomenon

01:23:58.600 --> 01:23:59.965
- in my lifetime.
- Mm-hmm.

01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:02.560
But the swoon theory is rubbish.

01:24:02.720 --> 01:24:04.961
"Rubbish."

01:24:05.080 --> 01:24:07.208
That's a... is that a...
a medical opinion?

01:24:07.320 --> 01:24:09.368
Yeah. It is, actually.

01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:11.045
Um...

01:24:11.160 --> 01:24:13.527
swoon theorists tend to skim
over the fact

01:24:13.640 --> 01:24:17.326
that Jesus was flogged
prior to his crucifixion.

01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:19.488
Do you know what happens
in a Roman flogging?

01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:23.764
Um, yeah, the person
is lashed with a whip.

01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:26.008
No, not lashed.

01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:29.209
Scourged and pummeled savagely.

01:24:29.320 --> 01:24:31.288
You see, the...
the cowhide whip

01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:33.880
is braided with metal balls
and bone fragments.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:37.482
The flesh on Jesus' back
would've been shredded.

01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:40.490
The very muscles
and sinews themselves

01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:41.931
laid open to exposure.

01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:44.725
The flogging itself
would have left Jesus

01:24:44.840 --> 01:24:47.127
in critical condition
from massive blood loss.

01:24:47.240 --> 01:24:49.846
Which is why he collapsed
under the weight of the cross

01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:51.928
that the Romans
made him carry through town.

01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:55.487
Mm-hmm.
Okay, so is it possible

01:24:55.600 --> 01:24:58.080
that Jesus survives
being spiked to the cross?

01:24:58.200 --> 01:25:00.043
Well, yes, you could survive it,

01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:01.764
but it's child's play

01:25:01.880 --> 01:25:04.929
compared to what comes next
in a crucifixion.

01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:08.726
Slow, agonizing death
by asphyxiation.

01:25:08.840 --> 01:25:10.569
Come with me.

01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:16.171
The stress
on Jesus' chest muscles

01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:19.568
would have locked his lungs
into the inhale position.

01:25:19.680 --> 01:25:22.126
Right, so in order
to let the breath out,

01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:24.846
he would have had
to shove himself up

01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:27.122
using his spiked wrists
and feet,

01:25:27.240 --> 01:25:30.164
scraping his shredded back
against the wood of the cross.

01:25:30.280 --> 01:25:32.203
And then sagged back down again

01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:34.084
in order to draw
his next breath,

01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:35.770
which he would have had
to have done

01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:37.962
over and over and over again

01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:41.482
until utter exhaustion
just made it impossible.

01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:43.489
And then, inevitably...

01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:45.682
He dies.
Uh, in... in theory.

01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:47.211
But let's-let's remember,

01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:49.482
these soldiers,
they're not doctors, okay?

01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:51.329
So maybe, uh...

01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:53.204
maybe they took him
off the cross and they...

01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:55.482
they thought he was dead
but, in fact, he wasn't.

01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:57.648
No, of course they weren't
medical doctors.

01:25:57.760 --> 01:25:59.125
They were professional killers.

01:25:59.240 --> 01:26:01.083
Right, and they were quite good
at their jobs.

01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:04.044
They had to be.
If a prisoner escaped alive,

01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:05.969
they themselves
would be executed.

01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:09.641
Mr. Strobel,
the crucifixion of Jesus

01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:13.003
is one of the best-attested
events in the ancient world.

01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:17.011
And, if you will,
the final nail in the coffin

01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:19.487
in the swoon theory is this:

01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:21.170
When the soldiers
thrust their spear

01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:23.322
between Jesus' ribs,
do you know what came out?

01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:25.204
Blood and water.

01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:26.845
Which we now know

01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:29.167
is a description
of pericardial effusion

01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:30.770
as a result of death
by asphyxiation.

01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:34.123
This is not a condition
anyone could fake.

01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:36.049
And so, to answer your question,

01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:38.891
yes, it is my medical opinion

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:40.416
that Jesus Christ died
on that cross.

01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:41.680
Excuse me, Doctor?

01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:43.922
- I just need your signature.
- One moment.

01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:46.168
Yeah, but-but-but...
I got a...

01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:48.009
I-I have a real problem

01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:50.168
with most of the experts
that I've talked to here.

01:26:50.280 --> 01:26:52.886
Which is?

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:54.764
Which is that most of them
are not impartial.

01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:56.291
And if I'm gonna take a guess,

01:26:56.440 --> 01:26:58.522
I would say
that you are not, either.

01:26:58.640 --> 01:27:00.642
And you would be correct, sir.

01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:03.411
Though I have learned
that most impartial travelers

01:27:03.520 --> 01:27:06.251
who undertake this journey

01:27:06.360 --> 01:27:07.691
rarely remain so.

01:27:07.800 --> 01:27:09.962
However, I can refer you

01:27:10.120 --> 01:27:12.088
to one of the most impartial
sources that I know.

01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:13.645
Would you trust

01:27:13.760 --> 01:27:15.649
<i>the Journal of the American
Medical Association?</i>

01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:18.811
Of course.

01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:21.566
It is a stellar
scientific journal.

01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:23.364
Even I will admit that.

01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:27.486
- "On the Physical Death
of Jesus." -Mm-hmm.

01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:31.241
"Clearly, the weight of the
medical and historical evidence

01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:35.046
"indicates that Jesus
was dead before the wound

01:27:35.160 --> 01:27:37.128
"to his side was inflicted.

01:27:37.240 --> 01:27:39.766
"Accordingly, interpretations
based on the assumption

01:27:39.880 --> 01:27:42.167
"that Jesus did not die
on the cross

01:27:42.280 --> 01:27:44.806
"appear to be at odds

01:27:44.920 --> 01:27:47.082
with modern medical knowledge."

01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:53.688
Doc, I gotta tell you,
you're, uh...

01:27:53.800 --> 01:27:56.371
you're not telling me
what I hoped to hear today.

01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:08.486
Lee?

01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:09.726
Hey, it's me.

01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:10.840
Everything all right?

01:28:10.920 --> 01:28:12.251
Kids okay?

01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:14.601
Sweetheart...

01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:17.007
it's your father.

01:28:21.120 --> 01:28:23.202
"My help comes from the Lord,

01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:25.203
"the Maker of Heaven and Earth.

01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:27.408
"He will not let your foot slip.

"He who watches over you

01:28:30.520 --> 01:28:33.251
"Indeed, He who watches

01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:35.806
"will neither slumber nor sleep.

"The Lord will watch

01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:00.209
In the name of the Father
and the Son

01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:02.288
and the Holy Spirit.

01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:25.765
You Okay?

01:30:27.080 --> 01:30:29.481
Did you know he had this
in his wallet?

01:30:30.720 --> 01:30:32.609
Yes.

01:30:44.960 --> 01:30:47.645
You know, your father,

01:30:47.760 --> 01:30:51.082
he was proud of everything
you ever accomplished.

01:30:52.600 --> 01:30:55.365
Look, he didn't know
how to say it very well,

01:30:55.480 --> 01:30:57.164
but he loved you, son.

01:30:59.080 --> 01:31:02.766
He really loved you.

01:31:16.440 --> 01:31:17.851
Okay?

01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:06.840
80 nations were represented...

01:32:06.880 --> 01:32:08.564
I'm going camping,

01:32:08.680 --> 01:32:11.126
and I'm bringing an apple...

01:32:11.240 --> 01:32:13.925
a banana...

01:32:14.040 --> 01:32:16.247
and a chinchilla.

01:32:16.360 --> 01:32:19.284
I'm going camping,
and I'm gonna bring an apple...

01:32:19.400 --> 01:32:22.051
a banana, uh...

01:32:22.160 --> 01:32:23.525
- ls he okay?
- Mm-hmm.

01:32:23.680 --> 01:32:25.170
Whatever you said and...

01:32:25.280 --> 01:32:26.850
- A chinchilla.
- A chinchilla...

01:32:26.960 --> 01:32:28.536
savagely beaten
in a prison fight

01:32:28.560 --> 01:32:30.016
- at Cook County Jail today.
- And a donkey. -Sweetie,

01:32:30.040 --> 01:32:31.616
- hold on, hold on, hold on.
- Sources inside the prison

01:32:31.640 --> 01:32:33.529
say Hicks was targeted
by gang members

01:32:33.640 --> 01:32:34.846
as a result of recent news

01:32:34.960 --> 01:32:37.008
identifying him
as a police informant.

01:32:37.120 --> 01:32:38.929
It is believed
that the prison guards

01:32:39.040 --> 01:32:41.202
did little to protect Hicks,

01:32:41.320 --> 01:32:43.607
a fate not uncommon
for cop shooters.

01:32:43.720 --> 01:32:46.007
Hicks was immediately taken
to Mercy Hospital,

01:32:46.160 --> 01:32:47.844
where he's in serious condition.

01:32:47.960 --> 01:32:51.442
Elsewhere in Chicago,
the wind is expected to kick up

01:32:51.560 --> 01:32:53.200
this evening over the lake
and continue...

01:33:22.320 --> 01:33:24.322
How's... how's he doing?

01:33:24.440 --> 01:33:26.488
Been in and out.

01:33:26.600 --> 01:33:27.761
Mostly out.

01:33:40.920 --> 01:33:42.331
Mr. Hicks?

01:33:43.720 --> 01:33:46.246
Mr. Hicks, it's Lee Strobel.

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:58.447
Just wanted to say that, um...

01:34:01.520 --> 01:34:04.000
that it's my fault.

01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:08.524
I...

01:34:08.640 --> 01:34:12.486
I'm... I missed the...
the truth.

01:34:13.800 --> 01:34:15.006
I'm-I'm sorry.

01:34:15.120 --> 01:34:17.327
I just... l-| didn't see it.

01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:22.010
You didn't want to see it.

01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:26.682
What's that?

01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:29.485
You didn't want to see it.

01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:39.684
<i>I've hit</i> a <i>brick Wall.</i>

01:34:39.800 --> 01:34:41.640
I have read through
every book you've given me.

01:34:41.680 --> 01:34:43.045
I've gone through
every argument.

01:34:43.160 --> 01:34:44.685
I've followed every lead.

01:34:44.800 --> 01:34:46.723
At some point, young man,
you're going to have

01:34:46.840 --> 01:34:48.888
to plant your flag
on a mountain of uncertainty,

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:50.764
where not every question
is answered.

01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:53.804
The human mind
will never get to the bottom

01:34:53.920 --> 01:34:56.400
of every mystery in the cosmos.

01:34:56.520 --> 01:35:00.127
Believing in God,
not believing in God...

01:35:00.240 --> 01:35:04.404
Either way,
still takes a leap of faith.

01:35:04.520 --> 01:35:06.443
So you're saying,

01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:09.370
even in our disbelief,

01:35:09.480 --> 01:35:12.290
that we still take
a leap of faith.

01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:14.562
More or less.

01:35:16.720 --> 01:35:20.406
Me, well, I've come
to my own conclusion.

01:35:20.520 --> 01:35:23.126
You're gonna have to do
the same thing for yourself.

01:35:36.200 --> 01:35:37.770
What are you doing here?

01:35:37.880 --> 01:35:39.325
I thought you were banished.

01:35:44.120 --> 01:35:45.360
Hey.

01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:48.204
What's the matter?

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:51.365
You people and your God.

01:35:51.480 --> 01:35:53.562
You just... you know,
you talk in circles.

01:35:53.680 --> 01:35:56.445
You offer... you offer
just enough evidence

01:35:56.600 --> 01:35:58.364
but never enough
to be conclusive.

01:35:58.520 --> 01:36:00.045
Then you fill in
all the gaps with,

01:36:00.160 --> 01:36:02.242
"Oh, well, yeah,
you just gotta have faith."

01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:04.402
It's a bunch of nonsense.

01:36:05.960 --> 01:36:07.849
You're really irritating,
you know that?

01:36:09.040 --> 01:36:10.804
Don't start with me, Kenny.

01:36:10.920 --> 01:36:13.571
You don't waste a lick of time

01:36:13.680 --> 01:36:16.809
bragging to all of us
how great a reporter you are.

01:36:16.920 --> 01:36:19.321
So, why can't you put up
or shut up on this story?

01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:21.090
What are you even talking about?

01:36:21.200 --> 01:36:24.249
Here's where the chili
meets the cheese, my friend.

01:36:24.360 --> 01:36:26.249
One of my heroes
was C.S. Lewis,

01:36:26.360 --> 01:36:29.250
a man who began as a skeptic,
much like yourself.

01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:32.011
At the end of his journey,
you know what he said?

01:36:32.120 --> 01:36:34.600
He said,
if Christianity is false,

01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:36.882
it's of zero importance.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.367
But if it's true,

01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:42.285
there's nothing more important
in the entire universe.

01:36:43.600 --> 01:36:45.125
So, you want your wife back?

01:36:45.240 --> 01:36:47.296
Well, hey, guess what,
people in hell want ice water.

01:36:47.320 --> 01:36:49.687
Not everybody gets
everything they want.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.002
Stop blaming me

01:36:53.160 --> 01:36:55.731
and the Church and God,
and do your job.

01:36:57.400 --> 01:36:59.050
Stack up the evidence,
follow the facts,

01:36:59.160 --> 01:37:02.130
and write the story,
win or lose.

01:37:10.440 --> 01:37:11.851
Good night.

01:37:22.440 --> 01:37:23.965
Father, please...

01:37:24.080 --> 01:37:25.889
<i>please soften Lee's heart.</i>

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.002
<i>Put a new spirit in him.</i>

01:37:28.120 --> 01:37:29.849
Remove from him
his heart of stone,

01:37:29.960 --> 01:37:31.928
and give him a heart of flesh.

01:37:46.800 --> 01:37:49.565
<i>The only way to truth
is through facts.</i>

01:37:49.680 --> 01:37:51.045
<i>The entire Christian faith</i>

01:37:51.160 --> 01:37:52.889
<i>hinges on the resurrection
of Jesus.</i>

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:54.496
<i>If it didn't happen,
it's a house of cards.</i>

01:37:54.520 --> 01:37:55.931
<i>No, you just have to show</i>

01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:57.376
<i>that Jesus died
and he was seen afterwards.</i>

01:37:57.400 --> 01:37:58.845
<i>How can we be sure</i>

01:37:58.960 --> 01:38:00.496
<i>of the reliability
of those manuscripts?</i>

01:38:00.520 --> 01:38:01.856
<i>Archaeologists have recovered</i>

01:38:01.880 --> 01:38:05.123
<i>5,843 Greek
New Testament manuscripts.</i>

01:38:05.240 --> 01:38:07.481
<i>Nothing else in history
even comes close.</i>

01:38:07.600 --> 01:38:08.976
<i>Would</i> you trust the Journal

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:10.656
- of the American Medical Association?
- Yes.

01:38:10.680 --> 01:38:12.360
<i>Jesus Christ died on that cross.</i>

01:38:12.400 --> 01:38:14.016
<i>You're not telling me
what I hoped to hear today.</i>

01:38:14.040 --> 01:38:15.080
<i>What if it is true?</i>

01:38:15.200 --> 01:38:16.440
<i>Wouldn't you want to know that?</i>

01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:17.656
<i>The first recorded
account tells us</i>

01:38:17.680 --> 01:38:18.886
<i>that he was buried in a tomb.</i>

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.162
<i>The empty tomb
is based on evidence.</i>

01:38:21.280 --> 01:38:22.441
<i>Isn't evidence your trade?</i>

01:38:22.560 --> 01:38:23.800
<i>Faith is the evidence</i>

01:38:23.960 --> 01:38:25.240
<i>of things we can't actually see.</i>

01:38:25.280 --> 01:38:26.576
<i>Any careful historian will see</i>

01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:27.965
<i>that the core account
is consistent</i>

01:38:28.080 --> 01:38:30.526
<i>even if a... a few
of the secondary details</i>

01:38:30.640 --> 01:38:32.369
<i>are told from different
perspectives.</i>

01:38:32.480 --> 01:38:36.280
<i>500 separate people
saw Jesus at the same time.</i>

01:38:36.400 --> 01:38:38.289
<i>That would be
an even bigger miracle</i>

01:38:38.400 --> 01:38:39.731
<i>than the Resurrection itself.</i>

01:38:39.840 --> 01:38:41.056
<i>The disciples reported
what actually happened.</i>

01:38:41.080 --> 01:38:42.296
<i>People with
zero motivation to lie.</i>

01:38:42.320 --> 01:38:43.896
<i>Do you really want
to know the truth?</i>

01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:45.490
<i>When is enough evidence
enough evidence?</i>

01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:46.976
<i>I felt something
that is maybe more real</i>

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:48.456
<i>than anything
I've ever felt in my life.</i>

01:38:48.480 --> 01:38:50.456
<i>This is not
a condition anyone could fake.</i>

01:38:50.480 --> 01:38:52.528
<i>Still takes</i> a <i>leap of faith.</i>

01:38:55.640 --> 01:38:57.927
<i>But why would he do it?</i>

01:38:58.040 --> 01:39:01.010
<i>It's really very simple.</i>

01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:03.208
<i>Love.</i>

01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:38.849
All right, God.

01:39:46.720 --> 01:39:48.449
You win.

01:40:01.520 --> 01:40:03.761
- Hey-
- Hey-

01:40:06.560 --> 01:40:07.925
Are you okay?

01:40:08.040 --> 01:40:09.087
Yeah.

01:40:09.200 --> 01:40:10.804
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:40:10.920 --> 01:40:12.524
How's he doing?

01:40:12.640 --> 01:40:14.165
Good.

01:40:14.320 --> 01:40:15.845
All right.
Come over here.

01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:17.803
I want to talk to you
for a second.

01:40:19.960 --> 01:40:21.849
Are you...
are you sure you're okay?

01:40:26.800 --> 01:40:31.169
So, I have not been, um...

01:40:31.280 --> 01:40:34.727
completely honest with you
over the last few months.

01:40:35.960 --> 01:40:37.485
That's a really scary way

01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:39.807
- to start a conversation.
- I... Just-just-just...

01:40:39.920 --> 01:40:41.684
hang with me here, okay?

01:40:43.160 --> 01:40:45.606
When you became a Christian,

01:40:45.720 --> 01:40:48.371
- I freaked out. I mean...
- Mm-hmm.

01:40:48.520 --> 01:40:51.000
Yeah, I was scared, um...

01:40:53.440 --> 01:40:56.728
And I felt like
that I needed to, um...

01:40:56.840 --> 01:40:58.410
to save you.

01:41:01.760 --> 01:41:03.649
And so I decided to set out

01:41:03.760 --> 01:41:06.730
to prove this was all a big con.

01:41:06.840 --> 01:41:10.811
And so that's what
I've been doing all this time.

01:41:10.960 --> 01:41:12.291
Your research?

01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:14.084
Yeah. I-I mean, look at this.

01:41:14.200 --> 01:41:15.884
It's... this is all...

01:41:17.480 --> 01:41:18.811
all that stuff.

01:41:20.320 --> 01:41:21.731
That's why I've been
so distracted.

01:41:21.840 --> 01:41:23.968
That's why I went to California.

01:41:24.080 --> 01:41:27.050
I just had to prove
this whole thing wrong.

01:41:29.960 --> 01:41:31.166
But I couldn't.

01:41:34.240 --> 01:41:36.720
The evidence for your faith...

01:41:39.120 --> 01:41:41.805
it's more overwhelming
than I could've ever imagined.

01:41:47.200 --> 01:41:49.931
But it wasn't
just the evidence, okay?

01:41:52.880 --> 01:41:54.291
It was you.

01:41:55.720 --> 01:41:58.564
You never stopped loving me.

01:41:58.680 --> 01:42:00.842
You never gave up on me.

01:42:03.120 --> 01:42:05.248
And I think, because of that,

01:42:05.360 --> 01:42:07.966
God didn't, either.

01:42:11.640 --> 01:42:13.961
Wh...

01:42:14.080 --> 01:42:15.080
What?

01:42:15.160 --> 01:42:16.764
I mean, I don't...

01:42:16.880 --> 01:42:18.689
I don't think God
gave up on you, either,

01:42:18.800 --> 01:42:22.282
what are you saying?

01:42:22.400 --> 01:42:25.085
Uh... I can't even fathom

01:42:25.240 --> 01:42:27.811
that I'm gonna say
these words out loud.

01:42:31.960 --> 01:42:33.564
I believe.

01:42:45.240 --> 01:42:47.846
Oh, hey, hey.

01:42:47.960 --> 01:42:50.440
Okay.
Let me show you something.

01:42:52.520 --> 01:42:54.887
Show you...

01:42:57.040 --> 01:42:59.884
"But as many as received Him,

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:03.721
to them He gave the right
to become children of God."

01:43:03.840 --> 01:43:05.365
Mm-hmm.

01:43:05.480 --> 01:43:08.165
"To those who believe
in His name."

01:43:09.560 --> 01:43:11.164
And what does that mean?

01:43:11.280 --> 01:43:14.648
That... means...

01:43:17.280 --> 01:43:20.011
Believe...

01:43:20.120 --> 01:43:22.805
plus receive...

01:43:22.920 --> 01:43:25.730
equals become.

01:43:29.160 --> 01:43:32.130
Okay. Um...

01:43:32.240 --> 01:43:35.050
So, then, how do I...
how do I receive?

01:43:35.160 --> 01:43:38.960
What do I... What's-what's the
protocol for, uh... for that?

01:43:39.080 --> 01:43:40.923
There's no wrong way
or right way.

01:43:41.040 --> 01:43:43.566
Just... you.

01:43:43.680 --> 01:43:45.489
- You talk to God.
- Mm-hmm.

01:43:45.600 --> 01:43:47.170
You tell Him your heart.

01:43:47.320 --> 01:43:49.243
Mm-hmm.

01:43:50.920 --> 01:43:52.365
A-And we do that right now?

01:43:52.480 --> 01:43:54.209
I mean, shouldn't we go
to church or...?

01:43:54.320 --> 01:43:56.209
Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

01:43:56.320 --> 01:43:58.049
Right here, right now.

01:43:58.160 --> 01:44:00.242
- This is church.
- Okay.

01:44:00.360 --> 01:44:02.408
Come here.

01:44:18.880 --> 01:44:21.645
God, um...

01:44:26.560 --> 01:44:27.891
Mm...

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:31.721
I have no idea what I'm doing.

01:44:38.760 --> 01:44:42.731
But I cannot ignore
the evidence.

01:44:42.880 --> 01:44:45.565
And I don't know everything.

01:44:45.680 --> 01:44:52.131
Uh, I-| never will know
everything.

01:44:52.240 --> 01:44:56.040
Um, but I...

01:44:56.160 --> 01:44:58.640
I know enough.

01:44:58.760 --> 01:45:00.842
And I believe it.

01:45:02.200 --> 01:45:04.521
And I'm sorry for what I've...

01:45:04.640 --> 01:45:07.166
what I've put my wife through,

01:45:07.320 --> 01:45:11.086
um, for what I put
my family through, uh...

01:45:13.160 --> 01:45:15.640
But I believe You're real,

01:45:15.760 --> 01:45:17.603
and I don't know
what comes next.

01:45:17.720 --> 01:45:20.007
I don't know...

01:45:20.120 --> 01:45:21.804
I don't know what it means.

01:45:21.960 --> 01:45:24.486
I just know that I want...
I want that.

01:45:24.600 --> 01:45:27.843
I want...
I want whatever's next.

01:45:27.960 --> 01:45:29.166
Um...

01:45:29.280 --> 01:45:31.408
So let's do that.

01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:35.249
Amen.

01:45:38.560 --> 01:45:40.403
Amen.

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:44.650
Thank you.

01:45:46.440 --> 01:45:49.205
I guess I'm crazy, too.

01:45:57.240 --> 01:45:59.607
Pitching him today.

01:46:00.680 --> 01:46:01.681
Don't blow it.

01:46:01.800 --> 01:46:04.246
Watch this.

01:46:05.480 --> 01:46:07.369
I got a pitch for you.

01:46:09.200 --> 01:46:11.407
Well, that didn't last long.

01:46:11.520 --> 01:46:13.363
Piece of junk.

01:46:13.480 --> 01:46:15.005
You hear about Hicks?

01:46:15.120 --> 01:46:16.451
Released from the hospital.

01:46:16.560 --> 01:46:19.166
No longer a resident
of Crook County Jail.

01:46:19.280 --> 01:46:20.725
I did.
That's great news.

01:46:20.840 --> 01:46:21.841
Mm.

01:46:27.960 --> 01:46:29.769
Come on, this is a joke, right?

01:46:29.880 --> 01:46:30.881
No. No, it's not.

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:32.411
I-I-I-I want to do

01:46:32.520 --> 01:46:35.126
a first-person
feature story, okay?

01:46:35.280 --> 01:46:36.805
An odyssey.

01:46:36.920 --> 01:46:40.402
Uh, one man's journey
from skepticism to faith.

01:46:40.520 --> 01:46:41.646
Forget it, Lee.

01:46:41.760 --> 01:46:43.250
I mean...

01:46:43.360 --> 01:46:44.964
good for you, I guess, but...

01:46:45.080 --> 01:46:47.765
we can't publish
something like this.

01:46:47.920 --> 01:46:49.888
We'd lose all credibility.
So would you.

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.241
I really wish
that you would reconsider.

01:46:52.360 --> 01:46:54.328
Stick to what you know, Lee.
Go on, now.

01:46:54.440 --> 01:46:55.726
Get out of here.

01:46:55.840 --> 01:46:57.968
Not until you've
at least heard me out.

01:46:59.520 --> 01:47:01.966
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hey, you. How are you?

01:47:02.080 --> 01:47:03.127
Good.

01:47:03.240 --> 01:47:04.924
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:47:05.040 --> 01:47:08.010
30?

01:47:09.680 --> 01:47:10.886
Dubois said no.

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.321
- He did?
- Yeah.

01:47:13.440 --> 01:47:16.205
- Oh, no. Sorry, hon.
- I did it! I did it!

01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:17.924
What did you did?

01:47:18.040 --> 01:47:20.407
I can finally reach the faucet.

01:47:20.520 --> 01:47:22.887
- Oh, my Lord.
- I'm tall enough now.

01:47:23.040 --> 01:47:25.805
Look at you!
You're a big girl now.

01:47:25.960 --> 01:47:28.361
Oh, no, you need to stop that.
That means you're growing up.

01:47:28.480 --> 01:47:30.084
You're not our little girl
anymore.

01:47:30.200 --> 01:47:33.363
It's not that big
of a deal, Daddy.

01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:36.006
I think it's a big deal.

01:47:36.120 --> 01:47:37.360
Hey, how 'bout a book?

01:47:37.480 --> 01:47:39.244
A What?

01:47:39.360 --> 01:47:41.806
Instead of an article,
how 'bout a book?

01:47:44.240 --> 01:47:45.571
What do you think about that?

01:47:45.680 --> 01:47:47.096
