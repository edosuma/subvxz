HA HA HA! ISAAC.

01:43.730 --> 01:46.191
HI. WHAT
ARE YOU DOING?

02:00.246 --> 02:02.040
I THINK WE CAN USE
SOME MORE WOOD.

02:02.207 --> 02:04.000
OH, WE'LL GET IT.

02:08.922 --> 02:09.714
EXCUSE ME.

02:09.881 --> 02:10.799
YOU SHOULDN'T BE
DOING THIS.

02:10.965 --> 02:11.883
OH, I CAN MANAGE.

02:12.050 --> 02:12.842
GIVE THAT TO ME.

02:13.009 --> 02:14.427
HERE. COME ON,
GIVE IT TO ME.

02:14.594 --> 02:17.180
IT'S A MAN'S WORK.
IT'S WHAT A HUSBAND'S FOR.

02:17.347 --> 02:18.389
HONESTLY,
YOU PEOPLE,

02:18.556 --> 02:20.975
I'M REALLY
QUITE CAPABLE.

02:21.142 --> 02:22.268
HOW DO YOU THINK
I MANAGE

02:22.435 --> 02:23.353
WHEN YOU'RE
NOT AROUND?

02:23.520 --> 02:26.189
BADLY. RIGHT, GIRLS?

02:26.356 --> 02:28.233
[GIGGLING]

02:28.399 --> 02:31.236
WELL, COME ON, GIRLS.
LET'S SHOW HIM.

02:31.402 --> 02:34.280
DON'T TAKE TOO MUCH.

02:34.447 --> 02:36.616
NO, NO, NO.
WE'LL TAKE THE REST.

02:36.783 --> 02:37.826
O.K.

02:39.786 --> 02:42.330
HOW IS IT?

02:42.497 --> 02:43.498
THAT'S DONE.

02:43.665 --> 02:44.457
GOOD.

02:44.624 --> 02:45.959
WE'RE ALMOST READY,
CHARLES.

02:46.125 --> 02:48.962
ALL RIGHT. GENTLEMEN,
WHY DON'T YOU

02:49.128 --> 02:50.672
FIND YOURSELF
A SEAT HERE?

02:53.842 --> 02:55.969
I THINK YOU ALL KNOW
JOE COULTER.

02:56.135 --> 02:58.263
AT LEAST MOST
OF YOU DO, ANYWAY.

02:58.429 --> 02:59.806
JOE'S THE REASON
WE'RE HERE.

02:59.973 --> 03:01.850
JA, AND HE'S
A GOOD REASON TOO.

03:02.016 --> 03:02.934
HE HAS THE--

03:03.101 --> 03:04.769
YEAH. LARS ALREADY KNOWS
ABOUT THIS,

03:04.936 --> 03:06.604
AND HE'S IN FAVOR OF IT,

03:06.771 --> 03:08.815
BUT I'M AFRAID HE'S GONNA GET
A LITTLE BIT AHEAD OF US.

03:08.982 --> 03:10.483
ALL RIGHT. I SHUT UP.

03:10.650 --> 03:13.611
ALL RIGHT. THE REASON WE'RE HERE
IS WE'RE FARMERS.

03:13.778 --> 03:15.655
LET'S BE HONEST
WITH EACH OTHER--

03:15.822 --> 03:16.823
WE'RE IN TROUBLE.

03:16.990 --> 03:18.616
WE'RE LOSING MONEY
WITH EVERY CROP.

03:18.783 --> 03:20.326
THE REASON
WE'RE LOSING MONEY

03:20.493 --> 03:22.829
IS BECAUSE WHEAT'S
OUR MONEY CROP,

03:22.996 --> 03:25.331
AND THERE'S NO MARKET
FOR WHEAT.

03:25.498 --> 03:27.417
THAT BRINGS US
TO JOSEPH COULTER.

03:27.584 --> 03:28.585
HE'S AN AGRONOMIST.

03:28.751 --> 03:30.628
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT
THAT WAS EITHER

03:30.795 --> 03:32.297
UNTIL HE EXPLAINED IT TO ME.

03:32.463 --> 03:34.924
IT'S A MAN WHO GOES TO SCHOOL
AND LEARNS ABOUT FARMING,

03:35.091 --> 03:37.468
ABOUT PLANNING,
ABOUT MODERN METHODS.

03:37.635 --> 03:41.222
WHY DON'T YOU GO AHEAD
AND SHOW THEM HOW THEY WORK?

03:44.517 --> 03:45.894
WOW, LOOK AT THAT.

03:46.060 --> 03:47.186
LET ME HAVE ONE
OF THEM.

03:47.353 --> 03:49.188
LET ME LOOK
AT THAT. YEAH.

03:49.355 --> 03:51.733
WHERE IN CREATION DID YOU
EVER FIND CORN LIKE THIS?

03:51.900 --> 03:54.152
HE RAISED IT
AT THE PETERSON'S PLACE.

03:54.319 --> 03:55.862
I'LL BE DOGGONE.

03:56.029 --> 03:57.739
IT DON'T LOOK REAL.

03:57.906 --> 04:00.783
WHAT YOU CALL INDIAN
CORN'S ALL I EVER SEEN.

04:00.950 --> 04:02.535
IT'S ONLY ABOUT
HALF THAT SIZE.

04:02.702 --> 04:03.786
IN 20 YEARS OF MILLING,

04:03.953 --> 04:05.788
THAT IS THE BEST CORN
I EVER SEE,

04:05.955 --> 04:07.540
AND YOU CAN BELIEVE THAT.

04:07.707 --> 04:10.793
NAW, YOU CAN'T GROW CORN LIKE
THIS AROUND HERE IN ANY AMOUNT

04:10.960 --> 04:12.378
WITH OUR SOIL
AND GROWING SEASON.

04:12.545 --> 04:14.380
YOU CAN MAKE THAT CORN
YOUR MONEY CROP

04:14.547 --> 04:15.673
INSTEAD OF WHEAT.

04:20.678 --> 04:22.138
JEHOSHAPHAT. I DON'T KNOW.

04:22.305 --> 04:25.767
IF IT DIDN'T WORK OUT,
I'D BE EATING MY HORSES!

04:25.934 --> 04:29.520
THIS IS A GOOD CROP,
BELIEVE ME.

04:29.687 --> 04:30.730
INGALLS, WHERE DO
YOU STAND ON THIS?

04:30.897 --> 04:31.856
YOU WANNA SWITCH
OVER TO CORN?

04:32.023 --> 04:32.982
YES, I DO.

04:33.149 --> 04:34.901
IF WE WAS TO CHANGE OVER,

04:35.068 --> 04:37.445
WHERE'D WE GET THE SEED
FOR THAT KIND OF CORN?

04:37.612 --> 04:40.323
I CAN GET THE SEED
AT A FAIR PRICE.

04:40.490 --> 04:44.452
MY WIFE'S FATHER'S A GRAIN
DEALER IN MINNEAPOLIS.

04:44.619 --> 04:45.745
I CAN GET THE SEED

04:45.912 --> 04:49.040
FOR THAT KIND OF CORN
FROM HIM-- ANY AMOUNT.

04:51.709 --> 04:53.461
HOW MUCH A BUSHEL?

04:53.628 --> 04:54.963
HIS COST.

04:55.129 --> 04:57.298
WHY WOULD HE GIVE IT
TO US AT COST?

04:57.465 --> 04:58.758
'CAUSE I WROTE HIM

04:58.925 --> 05:00.259
ABOUT THE CORN
I GREW HERE

05:00.426 --> 05:02.178
AND TOLD HIM YOU
COULD GROW THE SAME.

05:02.345 --> 05:04.138
HE WROTE BACK AND SAID
HE'D HELP YOU GET STARTED

05:04.305 --> 05:06.182
IF YOU'D GIVE HIM
THE FIRST CHANCE

05:06.349 --> 05:08.309
TO BUY YOUR CROP
AT A FAIR PRICE.

05:08.476 --> 05:11.562
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA
MAKE OUT OF THE DEAL?

05:11.729 --> 05:13.272
SOME FRIENDS, I HOPE.

05:13.439 --> 05:16.651
I'D LIKE TO STAY HERE
FOR A WHILE.

05:20.154 --> 05:23.408
I'LL GO TO MINNEAPOLIS
AND BUY THE SEED FOR YOU.

05:23.574 --> 05:24.867
I CAN GET THERE AND GET BACK

05:25.034 --> 05:29.080
BY THE TIME YOU GET YOUR
FIELDS READY FOR PLANTING.

05:29.247 --> 05:30.248
THAT'S IT.

05:30.415 --> 05:32.166
ALL RIGHT, WHAT DO YOU SAY?

05:32.333 --> 05:34.419
I THINK IT'S THE CHANCE
OF A LIFETIME,

05:34.585 --> 05:36.462
AND I'M GONNA TAKE IT.

05:36.629 --> 05:39.132
LET'S HAVE A SHOW OF HANDS--
EVERYBODY IN FAVOR.

05:48.307 --> 05:50.309
WELL, WHAT DO WE GOT TO LOSE?

05:50.476 --> 05:52.645
ALL RIGHT. AGREED THEN.

05:52.812 --> 05:55.398
NOW LET'S FIND OUT IF THIS CORN
TASTES AS GOOD AS IT LOOKS.

05:55.565 --> 05:56.649
CAROLINE, WE'RE READY.

05:56.816 --> 06:01.070
BOYS? GIVE US A HAND
HERE, WILL YOU?

06:03.531 --> 06:04.991
PICK UP SOME
OF THESE THINGS.

06:05.158 --> 06:06.909
THANK YOU.

06:16.044 --> 06:18.212
MRS. COULTER'S NICE,
ISN'T SHE?

06:18.379 --> 06:19.172
YEAH.

06:19.338 --> 06:20.673
SHE'S PRETTY, TOO.

06:20.840 --> 06:23.551
SHE SURE IS.

06:23.718 --> 06:24.802
IT WOULD BE AWFUL

06:24.969 --> 06:29.098
IF SHE WASN'T REALLY
GOING TO HAVE A BABY.

06:29.265 --> 06:30.892
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

06:31.059 --> 06:34.687
WELL, IF SHE JUST HAD
A GIANT STOMACH

06:34.854 --> 06:36.564
FOR EVER AND EVER.

06:36.731 --> 06:40.234
THAT'S SILLY.
SHE'LL HAVE THE BABY,

06:40.401 --> 06:42.820
AND HER STOMACH
WILL GO AWAY.

06:44.197 --> 06:46.240
MRS. LEADBETTOR
HAS A BIG STOMACH,

06:46.407 --> 06:47.784
AND IT DOESN'T GO AWAY.

06:47.950 --> 06:51.079
MRS. LEADBETTOR ISN'T
GONNA HAVE A BABY.

06:51.245 --> 06:54.123
SHE JUST EATS TOO MUCH.

06:54.290 --> 06:56.167
HOW CAN YOU TELL
THE DIFFERENCE?

06:56.334 --> 07:00.004
I MEAN, HOW DO YOU KNOW
WHEN IT'S A BABY

07:00.171 --> 07:01.798
OR JUST TOO MUCH SUPPER?

07:01.964 --> 07:05.176
DR. BAKER CAN TELL.

07:05.343 --> 07:07.428
AND MA SAYS THE BABY
KICKS INSIDE.

07:07.595 --> 07:09.055
YUCK.

07:09.222 --> 07:12.725
I KNOW I DON'T WANNA
HAVE A BABY.

07:12.892 --> 07:15.436
WHY NOT?

07:15.603 --> 07:17.772
WELL, IT HURTS ENOUGH
WHEN WILLIE OLESON

07:17.939 --> 07:20.149
KICKS ME
FROM THE OUTSIDE.

07:20.316 --> 07:22.568
IT MUST HURT
TWICE AS BAD

07:22.735 --> 07:25.905
WHEN YOU GET KICKED
FROM THE INSIDE.

07:26.072 --> 07:27.240
NO, IT DOESN'T.

07:27.406 --> 07:28.866
WHY NOT?

07:29.033 --> 07:31.577
BECAUSE THE BABY
DOESN'T HAVE SHOES ON.

07:31.744 --> 07:34.789
OH, YEAH.

07:34.956 --> 07:36.624
SEE YOU IN THE MORNING.

07:36.791 --> 07:38.709
GOOD NIGHT.

07:42.213 --> 07:46.092
I WISH WILLIE OLESON
DIDN'T HAVE SHOES ON.

07:46.259 --> 07:47.885
IT'S 4 DAYS TO MINNEAPOLIS.

07:48.052 --> 07:50.721
IT SHOULDN'T BE MORE THAN
2, 3 DAYS AT THE MOST

07:50.888 --> 07:51.931
TO GET THE TEAM,
THE WAGON,

07:52.098 --> 07:53.474
AND THE SEED,
AND START BACK.

07:53.641 --> 07:56.269
I'VE ALLOWED 7 DAYS
FOR THE RETURN TRIP,

07:56.435 --> 07:57.854
AND THAT MEANS 2 WEEKS.

07:58.020 --> 08:00.398
2 WEEKS, AND THEN
I'LL BE HOME.

08:00.565 --> 08:03.442
YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT
THAT LONG?

08:03.609 --> 08:05.820
I THINK SO.

08:05.987 --> 08:07.864
IF IT'S ANY LONGER,
I'LL WORRY.

08:08.030 --> 08:09.282
YOU AND A LOT
OF OTHER PEOPLE.

08:09.448 --> 08:11.200
I PROMISED EVERYBODY
I'D BE BACK IN 2 WEEKS,

08:11.367 --> 08:13.911
AND I'D BETTER BE, OR
THERE'LL BE ALL HECK TO PAY.

08:14.078 --> 08:15.079
I DON'T SEE WHY.

08:15.246 --> 08:16.914
IF YOU WERE GAMBLING
EVERYTHING YOU HAVE

08:17.081 --> 08:19.792
ON MY SAY-SO, YOU WOULD,
AND THEY ARE.

08:19.959 --> 08:21.752
THEY'LL HAVE THEIR FIELDS
READY BEFORE 2 WEEKS,

08:21.919 --> 08:23.671
AND THEY'LL BE LOOKING
DOWN THAT ROAD.

08:25.882 --> 08:29.802
NOW YOU JUST TAKE CARE
OF YOURSELF.

08:29.969 --> 08:31.012
THAT'S THE MOST
IMPORTANT THING.

08:31.179 --> 08:33.264
I'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

08:33.431 --> 08:34.390
MRS. INGALLS
AND HER GIRLS

08:34.557 --> 08:35.850
WILL BE RIGHT THERE
IF I NEED THEM.

08:36.017 --> 08:37.143
O.K.

08:37.310 --> 08:39.395
YOUR FATHER'S BEEN SAYING
I'D NEVER GROW UP.

08:39.562 --> 08:41.772
WELL, MAYBE I HAVE NOW.

08:41.939 --> 08:45.067
MAYBE THIS'LL PROVE IT
TO HIM.

08:46.652 --> 08:49.322
NEVER MIND
WHAT PAPA SAYS.

08:50.865 --> 08:54.410
[VOICE BREAKS] YOU'RE ALL
THE MAN I'LL EVER WANT.

08:56.287 --> 08:58.664
THAT'S MY GIRL.

08:58.831 --> 09:00.499
WELL, COME ON.
KISS ME GOOD-BYE

09:00.666 --> 09:02.418
BEFORE YOU CLOUD UP
AND RAIN.

09:07.715 --> 09:08.966
O.K.

09:30.404 --> 09:32.448
Joe: HEY!

09:32.615 --> 09:33.866

09:51.342 --> 09:52.760
GIDDY-UP THERE.

10:11.737 --> 10:13.739
NEVER HEARD
OF IT BEFORE.

10:13.906 --> 10:14.740
HEARD OF WHAT?

10:14.907 --> 10:15.700
PLOWING IN THE DARK.

10:15.866 --> 10:17.702
PA CAN SEE
IN THE DARK.

10:17.868 --> 10:20.037
ONLY OWLS CAN SEE
IN THE DARK.

10:20.204 --> 10:23.749
HI, EVERYBODY.
WELL, LOOKIE THERE.

10:23.916 --> 10:26.585
I'M A FEW MINUTES LATE,
AND ALL THE SUPPER'S GONE.

10:26.752 --> 10:27.920
YOU ALWAYS SAY

10:28.087 --> 10:29.213
IF YOU CAN'T GET TO
THE TABLE ON TIME,

10:29.380 --> 10:30.715
YOU DON'T DESERVE
YOUR SUPPER.

10:30.881 --> 10:32.383
I NEVER SHOULD
HAVE SAID THAT.

10:32.550 --> 10:33.843
DID YOU GET
A LOT DONE?

10:34.010 --> 10:35.344
OH, I SURE DID,
GOT EVERYTHING PLOWED

10:35.511 --> 10:37.263
ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE
OF THE CREEK.

10:37.430 --> 10:39.932
ANOTHER 2 DAYS, I OUGHT TO
HAVE ALL THE FIELDS PLOWED.

10:40.099 --> 10:41.267
OH, THAT'S GOOD.

10:41.434 --> 10:45.062
CAROLINE, IT DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE.
WHAT DOES?

10:45.229 --> 10:46.939
WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE
PLOWING A FIELD

10:47.106 --> 10:48.941
FOR A WHEAT CROP YOU KNOW YOU'RE
NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO SELL

10:49.108 --> 10:50.901
OR YOU'RE PLOWING IT
FOR A CORN CROP

10:51.068 --> 10:53.154
YOU KNOW IS GONNA MAKE SOME
GOOD LIVING FOR A CHANGE.

10:53.321 --> 10:54.363
YOU MARK MY WORDS.

10:54.530 --> 10:56.574
THIS NEW CORN IS GONNA
BE THE BIGGEST THING

10:56.741 --> 10:59.118
TO HIT THIS PART
OF THE COUNTRY.

10:59.285 --> 11:00.286
OH, THAT LOOKS GOOD.

11:00.453 --> 11:02.121
WISH IT WOULD HURRY UP
AND GET HERE.

11:02.288 --> 11:03.456
IT'S A LONG
TIME YET.

11:03.622 --> 11:05.458
LT'LL JUST BE A WEEK
FROM TOMORROW.

11:05.624 --> 11:07.376
I FIGURE COULTER'S

11:07.543 --> 11:08.878
MAKING OUR DEAL.

11:18.763 --> 11:20.681

11:27.021 --> 11:29.023
WELL, THAT'LL ABOUT DO IT,
MR. COULTER.

11:29.190 --> 11:30.691
ONE MORE THING.

11:35.196 --> 11:37.990
HA HA! LET ME HELP YOU
WITH THAT.

11:38.157 --> 11:40.409
I'M GONNA BE A FATHER
PRETTY SOON.

11:40.576 --> 11:41.327
YEAH?

11:41.494 --> 11:43.079
MAY HAVE TO GET
A SIDE SADDLE

11:43.245 --> 11:44.413
IF IT'S A LITTLE GIRL.

11:44.580 --> 11:45.664
YEAH.

11:48.209 --> 11:50.086
WELL, HAVE A GOOD TRIP.

11:50.252 --> 11:51.504
O.K. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

11:51.670 --> 11:54.173
YOU'RE WELCOME.

11:54.340 --> 11:55.466
GO, FRANK.

12:18.697 --> 12:20.366
HEY, INGALLS.

12:20.533 --> 12:23.452
WHOA. WHOA.

12:23.619 --> 12:24.578
HEY, DON'T TELL ME.

12:24.745 --> 12:25.704
MIDDLE OF THE DAY,
MIDDLE OF THE WEEK,

12:25.871 --> 12:27.498
AND YOU'RE OUT
HUNTING, HUH?

12:27.665 --> 12:29.208
IT'S THAT OR GO BATS.

12:29.375 --> 12:31.210
I FINISHED ALL MY WORK
YESTERDAY.

12:31.377 --> 12:32.545
I DONE EVERYTHING TWICE.

12:32.711 --> 12:34.046
I SMASHED EVERY CLOD.

12:34.213 --> 12:36.424
I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING,
INGALLS. I AIN'T NEVER BEEN

12:36.590 --> 12:38.968
THROUGH ANYTHING LIKE THIS
BEFORE IN MY WHOLE LIFE.

12:39.135 --> 12:41.220
IT'S WORSE THAN WHEN
I WAS A LITTLE KID

12:41.387 --> 12:42.555
WAITING FOR CHRISTMAS.

12:42.721 --> 12:43.973
I KNOW. I FEEL
THE SAME WAY.

YOU GOT ANY IDEA

17:39.351 --> 17:40.686

44:46.852 --> 44:49.730
THE SEED CORN'S OUT
TO MR. COULTER'S PLACE.

44:49.897 --> 44:51.982
MR. COULTER'S HURT
BECAUSE THE TEAM RUN OFF

44:52.149 --> 44:53.317

44:53.484 --> 44:55.944
BUT HE'S ALL RIGHT.

45:06.830 --> 45:09.291
WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?

45:09.458 --> 45:12.753
YOUR PRECIOUS SEED CORN
IS HERE.

45:36.527 --> 45:37.694
YOU ALL RIGHT?

45:37.861 --> 45:39.571
I'M FINE.

45:41.240 --> 45:43.325
WELL, THAT SEEMS
TO BE EVERYTHING.

45:43.492 --> 45:45.411
LOOKS LIKE WE'RE READY
TO GO.

45:45.577 --> 45:47.913
[KNOCK AT DOOR]

45:52.626 --> 45:53.502
MRS. COULTER?

45:53.669 --> 45:54.795
HELLO.

45:56.088 --> 45:57.423
JOSEPH.

46:00.551 --> 46:04.263
I SEE YOU'RE ALL PACKED,
SET TO GO, HUH?

46:04.430 --> 46:05.431
YEAH.

46:05.597 --> 46:08.767
GUESS THERE'S NO WAY
TO CHANGE YOUR MIND.

46:09.768 --> 46:12.896
CHARLES, AFTER WHAT
MY SO-CALLED FRIENDS

46:13.063 --> 46:14.356
AND NEIGHBORS DID
TO MY WIFE

46:14.523 --> 46:19.403
WHILE I WAS OUT BUSTING
MY LEG FOR THEM, NO.

46:19.570 --> 46:21.363
NO, I WANT NOTHING MORE
TO DO WITH THEM

46:21.530 --> 46:23.824
OR THIS PART
OF THE COUNTRY.

46:26.577 --> 46:28.745
YOU FEEL THE SAME WAY?

46:28.912 --> 46:31.915
I MOST CERTAINLY DO.

46:33.167 --> 46:35.335
I CAN'T SAY
AS I BLAME YOU.

46:35.502 --> 46:36.670
BESIDES, WITH THAT LEG,

46:36.837 --> 46:37.713
YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE

46:37.880 --> 46:39.423
TO MAKE A CROP
THIS YEAR ANYWAY.

46:39.590 --> 46:41.633
THAT'S THE TRUTH.

46:41.800 --> 46:43.927
BEFORE YOU GO, I'D LIKE
TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

46:44.094 --> 46:45.179
WHAT YOU GOT?

46:45.345 --> 46:47.389
LT'LL JUST TAKE A SECOND.
COME ON OUTSIDE.

47:11.955 --> 47:14.166
NOT ONE OF YOUR
FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS

47:14.333 --> 47:15.709
IS GONNA PLANT
A SEED

47:15.876 --> 47:19.087
UNTIL THEY'VE PLOWED AND
PLANTED YOUR FIELD.

47:37.314 --> 47:38.857
STILL WANNA LEAVE?

47:48.408 --> 47:53.288
TRUDY? LET'S GO SAY HELLO
TO OUR NEW NEIGHBORS.
