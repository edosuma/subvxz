00:01.369 --> 00:03.337
NARRATOR: <i>Marshall and Marvin</i>
<i>were taking the bus</i>

00:03.339 --> 00:06.039
<i>on their way to Long Island</i>
<i>to meet up with us.</i>

00:06.041 --> 00:07.424
(crying) There, there,
little Marvin.

00:07.426 --> 00:09.126
Let no more
tears fall.

00:09.128 --> 00:12.679
We're gonna see Mommy
in no time at all.

00:12.681 --> 00:14.882
Hello there. I'm sorry
for all of the noise.

00:14.884 --> 00:17.267
It's been a long day
for the Eriksen boys.

00:17.269 --> 00:19.353
Uh... what's with the rhyming?

00:19.355 --> 00:20.554
I'm glad that you ask.

00:20.556 --> 00:23.506
To get my son
sleeping is no easy task.

00:23.508 --> 00:26.059
<i>A few weeks ago,</i>
<i>the job fell to my wife.</i>

00:26.061 --> 00:28.529
<i>And as the poor baby cried out</i>
<i>for dear life,</i>

00:28.531 --> 00:31.698
<i>she read every book,</i>
<i>but all were no use</i>

00:31.700 --> 00:35.035
<i>until she arrived</i>
<i>at a mother named Goose.</i>

00:35.037 --> 00:36.987
Why, Marvin...
MARSHALL: <i>She noted.</i>

00:36.989 --> 00:38.822
...these rhymes
make you tired!

00:38.824 --> 00:40.857
And ever since then,
all young Marvin's required

00:40.859 --> 00:43.360
is one book of rhymes,
and to dream land he goes.

00:43.362 --> 00:44.828
Now, what shall we read?

00:44.830 --> 00:47.414
Oh, crap, I left
his book in the car!

00:47.416 --> 00:49.199
(crying)

00:49.201 --> 00:50.467
That blows.

00:50.469 --> 00:52.386
(crying stops)

00:52.573 --> 00:56.573

01:05.183 --> 01:06.817
Oh, no, what a bummer!

01:06.819 --> 01:08.485
What craptastic luck!

01:08.487 --> 01:10.771
Without Marvin's rhyme book,
this ride's gonna suck!

01:10.773 --> 01:12.823
Does anyone here have
some poetry maybe?

01:12.825 --> 01:14.107
Or any advice?
Yeah!

01:14.109 --> 01:15.659
Don't have a baby!

01:15.661 --> 01:17.611
(laughter)

01:17.613 --> 01:19.496
I guess if I don't want
young Marvin to wake up,

01:19.498 --> 01:22.399
the rhymes will just have
to be ones that I make up.

01:22.401 --> 01:25.568
I'll whip up some poetry
in seconds flat!

01:28.506 --> 01:31.375
Oh, I know!

01:31.377 --> 01:34.011
This story's called
<i>Mosby at the Bat!</i>

01:39.267 --> 01:41.935
<i>The outlook wasn't brilliant</i>
<i>for poor Ted's romantic life.</i>

01:41.937 --> 01:45.755
<i>He was deep into his thirties,</i>
<i>and yet, still he had no wife.</i>

01:45.757 --> 01:47.590
<i>But then, one day</i>
<i>whilst grading papers,</i>

01:47.592 --> 01:49.142
<i>life sent him a whammy.</i>

01:49.144 --> 01:51.111
<i>A physics prof named Lisa</i>

01:51.113 --> 01:52.529
<i>who'd just moved here</i>
<i>from Miami.</i>

01:52.531 --> 01:53.530
Professor?

01:53.532 --> 01:55.432
<i>She asked timidly.</i>
<i>He answered:</i>

01:55.434 --> 01:56.950
Call me Ted.
Oh.

01:56.952 --> 01:58.268
I don't want to bother you.

01:58.270 --> 01:59.870
Please, have a seat.
<i>He said.</i>

01:59.872 --> 02:03.290
I'm fairly new to teaching,
and I'm looking for advice.

02:03.292 --> 02:06.576
Every night I practice giving
lectures, sometimes twice.

02:06.578 --> 02:07.744
But when I teach

02:07.746 --> 02:10.913
magnetic force,
I just see eyeballs glazing.

02:10.916 --> 02:16.420
I asked around, and people say
your lectures are amazing.

02:16.422 --> 02:17.754
Which is really
saying something,

02:17.756 --> 02:19.956
because, architecture? Yawn.

02:19.958 --> 02:21.642
<i>And Ted thought...</i>

02:21.644 --> 02:23.960
TED: <i>Psh, yeah, 'cause physics</i>
<i>is so interesting.</i>

02:23.962 --> 02:25.479
Go on.

02:25.481 --> 02:27.130
It's just
that you're so skilled,

02:27.132 --> 02:29.016
and I'm a relative beginner.

02:29.018 --> 02:32.802
If it isn't too much trouble,
can I take you out to dinner?

02:32.804 --> 02:36.523
I'd love to get some pointers,
and I shouldn't keep you late.

02:36.525 --> 02:37.974
What do you say?

02:37.976 --> 02:39.526
What do I say?

02:39.528 --> 02:41.161
Teddy Westside's
got a date!

02:41.163 --> 02:43.313
ALL: Hooray!
MARSHALL: <i>We cheered.</i>

02:43.315 --> 02:44.331
Ted's off the bench!

02:44.333 --> 02:45.699
Our boy's back in the game!

02:45.701 --> 02:47.334
Thank God, it's been
a hundred years

02:47.336 --> 02:48.535
since Mosby scored a dame.

02:48.537 --> 02:50.420
The last time he saw
boobies was

02:50.422 --> 02:51.838
the screen-test
scene in <i>Fame.</i>

02:51.840 --> 02:53.290
The last girl he dated,

02:53.292 --> 02:55.158
I think "Righty" was her name.

02:55.160 --> 02:57.010
Hold it.
Let's not all go crazy

02:57.012 --> 02:58.712
like some wild berzerkers.

02:58.714 --> 03:01.381
What if this is just a business
meal between co-workers?

03:01.383 --> 03:03.500
MARSHALL: <i>Ted thought back</i>
<i>on past failed dates.</i>

03:03.502 --> 03:05.602
Oh, God, that
could be true.

03:05.604 --> 03:08.805
How many times have I come
home to find my balls are blue?

03:08.807 --> 03:12.175
It all depends where Ted and
his new fetching young Floridian

03:12.177 --> 03:14.844
are standing in relation
to that puzzling meridian

03:14.846 --> 03:17.147
called
"The International Date Line."

03:17.149 --> 03:18.515
That's right, new theory.

03:18.517 --> 03:20.517
"What's that," you ask?
Nobody did.

03:20.519 --> 03:23.120
I'll now address your query!
The date line

03:23.122 --> 03:26.206
is the border betwixt happiness
and sorrow.

03:26.208 --> 03:28.525
On this side,
you go home tonight.

03:28.527 --> 03:31.361
On this side, home tomorrow.

03:31.363 --> 03:34.831
MARSHALL: <i>And then, as Barney made some</i>
<i>gestures that were rather rude,</i>

03:34.833 --> 03:38.085
<i>Ted left to go meet Lisa,</i>
<i>in a rather puzzled mood.</i>

03:38.087 --> 03:39.803
<i>Was this a date?</i>

03:39.805 --> 03:41.722
<i>He simply couldn't tell</i>
<i>how he was faring.</i>

03:41.724 --> 03:42.923
<i>Then Lisa showed up.</i>

03:42.925 --> 03:46.426
<i>Ted rejoiced to see</i>
<i>what she was wearing.</i>

03:46.428 --> 03:47.928
<i>For girls at business dinners</i>

03:47.930 --> 03:50.046
<i>don't have necklines</i>
<i>that revealing!</i>

03:54.185 --> 03:57.354
<i>But then a friendly handshake</i>
<i>gave poor Ted</i>

03:57.356 --> 03:59.222
<i>a sinking feeling.</i>

04:03.394 --> 04:04.694
<i>And so, the night wore on.</i>

04:04.696 --> 04:07.197
<i>And back and forth,</i>
<i>the globe rotated.</i>

04:07.199 --> 04:10.917
<i>But still, Ted's curiosity was</i>
<i>never fully sated.</i>

04:10.919 --> 04:12.369
<i>How long could this continue?</i>

04:12.371 --> 04:14.204
<i>He was truly fortune's pawn.</i>

04:14.206 --> 04:16.238
<i>Then Lisa saw the TV.</i>

04:16.241 --> 04:17.673
Hey, the Yankees game is on!

04:17.676 --> 04:19.509
Of baseball...
<i>Ted observed...</i>

04:19.511 --> 04:22.295
...you seem to have some
firsthand knowledge.

04:22.297 --> 04:24.181
<i>To which the lady shrugged</i>
<i>and said...</i>

04:24.183 --> 04:25.766
I played softball in college.

04:28.636 --> 04:30.420
Now the age-old softball
stereotype's just that,

04:30.422 --> 04:31.855
and nothing more.

04:31.857 --> 04:33.557
Yeah!
<i>But as the Yankees got a run,</i>

04:33.559 --> 04:35.642
<i>Ted feared he wouldn't score.</i>

04:35.644 --> 04:37.444
<i>For while the date side</i>
<i>of the line's</i>

04:37.446 --> 04:39.613
<i>the one we all might guess</i>
<i>he's in,</i>

04:39.615 --> 04:42.449
<i>there'll be no joy in Tedville</i>
<i>if our Lisa is a...</i>

04:42.451 --> 04:44.034
Yes! We win!

04:44.036 --> 04:46.403
<i>Then Lisa took a drink</i>
<i>and said...</i>

04:46.405 --> 04:48.405
This may sound kind of random,

04:48.407 --> 04:51.241
but there actually is a reason
for my rabid Yankee fandom.

04:51.243 --> 04:52.993
I guess I'll just be
honest here,

04:52.995 --> 04:55.045
though crazy it may seem.

04:55.047 --> 04:59.216
My first week in New York,
I dated someone on the team.

04:59.218 --> 05:00.300
Which player?

05:00.302 --> 05:01.951
I'm not saying.
Please?

05:01.953 --> 05:03.303
What are you, a reporter?

05:03.305 --> 05:04.671
<i>Ted's mind began to race.</i>

05:04.673 --> 05:06.473
<i>The waiter came</i>
<i>to take their order.</i>

05:06.475 --> 05:07.790
<i>As Lisa said...</i>

05:07.792 --> 05:09.893
I might like
the spaghetti marinara.

05:09.895 --> 05:11.344
<i>Poor Ted just wondered</i>
<i>silently...</i>

05:11.346 --> 05:13.780
TED:
<i>Mariano Rivera?</i>

05:13.782 --> 05:15.098
MARSHALL:
<i>And as she said...</i>

05:15.100 --> 05:17.133
I read this place has great
chicken Milano.

05:17.135 --> 05:19.352
<i>All Ted could bring himself</i>
<i>to think was:</i>

05:19.354 --> 05:21.438
TED:
<i>Alfonso Soriano?</i>

05:21.440 --> 05:23.039
I want something hearty.

05:23.041 --> 05:25.158
How about blackened miso cod?

05:25.160 --> 05:26.443
TED:
<i>Is it Joe Girardi?</i>

05:26.445 --> 05:28.812
<i>Holy crap, is it A-Rod?!</i>

05:28.814 --> 05:30.413
<i>Okay, Ted, calm down.</i>

05:30.415 --> 05:32.115
<i>You've got</i>
<i>to get yourself together.</i>

05:32.117 --> 05:33.667
<i>Just smile, be charming,</i>

05:33.669 --> 05:36.036
<i>ooze charisma,</i>
<i>talk about the weather.</i>

05:36.038 --> 05:37.320
<i>For this might be a date,</i>

05:37.322 --> 05:39.539
<i>which means there might be</i>
<i>hanky-panky.</i>

05:39.541 --> 05:42.926
<i>So, dude, be cool, relax,</i>
<i>don't even...</i>

05:42.928 --> 05:44.845
Just tell me which Yankee!

05:46.230 --> 05:48.431
I'd rather not
discuss this here.

05:48.433 --> 05:50.183
But then again, I'd hate...

05:50.185 --> 05:53.353
to let a silly secret ruin
such a lovely date.

05:53.355 --> 05:54.721
<i>If there's</i>

05:54.723 --> 05:55.939
an elephant in the room,

05:55.941 --> 05:57.140
why don't we just remove it?

05:57.142 --> 05:58.475
I dated Derek Jeter.

05:58.477 --> 05:59.842
Here's a picture
that'll prove it.

05:59.844 --> 06:02.062
MARSHALL: <i>As Ted looked</i>
<i>at that cell phone pic,</i>

06:02.064 --> 06:03.980
<i>there were two things</i>
<i>he reckoned.</i>

06:03.982 --> 06:05.848
<i>This definitely was a date,</i>

06:05.850 --> 06:08.618
<i>but there wouldn't be a second.</i>

06:09.520 --> 06:10.670
See? It worked.

06:10.672 --> 06:12.873
I said some rhymes,
and out my boy did conk.

06:13.541 --> 06:15.242
Now let's enjoy the ride.

06:15.244 --> 06:16.159
(brakes screech)

06:16.161 --> 06:18.078
Move, jackass!
(honk)

06:18.080 --> 06:20.380
(crying)

06:21.349 --> 06:24.953
Okay, I need a brand-new tale
to silence Marvin's chatter.

06:24.954 --> 06:27.955
I don't know, that last one had
some sketchy subject matter.

06:27.957 --> 06:31.025
Forgive me, but before you got
here, did you smoke a joint?

06:31.027 --> 06:33.294
You don't tell kids a tale
that crass!

06:33.296 --> 06:34.812
NARRATOR:
<i>I guess he had a point.</i>

06:34.814 --> 06:37.064
I know, I said some things
that were,

06:37.066 --> 06:39.200
as you say,
kind of questionable.

06:39.202 --> 06:41.252
The truth is,
children Marvin's age

06:41.254 --> 06:43.087
aren't really
that impressionable.

06:43.089 --> 06:45.623
Do you remember anything
from when you were this small?

06:45.625 --> 06:48.726
Pumpkin picking at age three is
the first thing I recall.

06:48.728 --> 06:50.094
Hmm.
Huh.

06:50.096 --> 06:51.479
He won't remember this.
I guess it's true.

06:51.481 --> 06:52.713
It better be.

06:52.715 --> 06:53.898
Or else we'll end up paying

06:53.900 --> 06:55.382
through the nose
for Marvin's therapy.

06:55.384 --> 06:58.319
Okay, buddy, nice chat,
but I think I need a break.

06:58.321 --> 06:59.220
Great idea.

06:59.222 --> 07:01.272
After this story!

07:01.274 --> 07:03.224
<i>Robin Takes the Cake.</i>

07:08.330 --> 07:10.198
<i>Once in an East Side bakery,</i>

07:10.200 --> 07:13.334
<i>your debonair Aunt Robin was</i>
<i>making other customers think,</i>

07:13.336 --> 07:15.286
<i>"Geez, who let this slob in?"</i>

07:15.288 --> 07:18.539
<i>She didn't care about their</i>
<i>stares, or who was looking on.</i>

07:18.541 --> 07:19.907
<i>She'd just broke up with...</i>

07:19.909 --> 07:21.092
Kevin.

07:21.094 --> 07:23.845
No, Gael. Or Scooby?

07:24.963 --> 07:26.580
Don?

07:27.249 --> 07:28.466
<i>Now, sometimes,</i>

07:28.468 --> 07:29.634
<i>when it rains it pours,</i>

07:29.636 --> 07:30.885
<i>and sometimes,</i>
<i>it starts snowing,</i>

07:30.887 --> 07:33.420
<i>for as cream filling</i>
<i>hit her shirt...</i>

07:33.422 --> 07:34.939
MAN:
Hey, Robin, how's it going?

07:34.941 --> 07:36.774
<i>'Twas Simon, her ex-boyfriend</i>

07:36.776 --> 07:39.143
<i>from her younger days</i>
<i>in Canada,</i>

07:39.145 --> 07:40.928
<i>but now, he looked</i>
<i>quite different...</i>

07:40.930 --> 07:43.397
Um...

07:43.399 --> 07:44.782
Rhyme.

07:44.784 --> 07:47.434
Uh... thinking. Uh...

07:47.436 --> 07:49.770
I've just been handed
a news flash.

07:49.772 --> 07:51.539
The word "Canada"
is unrhymeable.

07:51.541 --> 07:52.940
It's easier to--
I don't know--

07:52.942 --> 07:54.876
get drunk and try
to climb a bull.

07:54.878 --> 07:57.295
But Canada, damn it,
ask any man on the planet

07:57.297 --> 07:58.629
and watch
their stammerin' stamina

07:58.631 --> 08:01.499
as they clamor and cram it
into the middle of a sentence

08:01.501 --> 08:02.833
for a shot at repentance,

08:02.835 --> 08:05.253
pass the problem on to all
their non-rhyming descendants.

08:05.255 --> 08:07.638
I've never met anyone who could
clean up after Canada.

08:07.640 --> 08:09.423
Except my Uncle Tony
from the Bronx.

08:09.425 --> 08:10.558
He's a janitor.

08:10.560 --> 08:12.760
(applause)

08:14.396 --> 08:17.515
Show-off.

08:17.517 --> 08:19.317
Simon. Nice to see you.

08:19.319 --> 08:21.402
So, what brings you to New York?

08:21.404 --> 08:22.937
I live here now.
What? Really?

08:22.939 --> 08:24.488
Yeah.
That's great.

08:24.490 --> 08:25.940
Can I get a fork?

08:25.942 --> 08:27.358
MARSHALL:
<i>He'd always been a deadbeat</i>

08:27.360 --> 08:29.110
<i>and your classic hoser phony,</i>

08:29.112 --> 08:32.029
<i>but seeing Simon all cleaned up</i>
<i>hit Robin like a Zamboni.</i>

08:32.030 --> 08:34.282
<i>And as she looked him</i>
<i>up and down,</i>

08:34.284 --> 08:35.750
<i>young Robin felt a tingle.</i>

08:35.751 --> 08:37.618
<i>Had Simon blossomed finally?</i>

08:37.620 --> 08:39.587
<i>And if so, was he single?</i>

08:39.589 --> 08:40.955
So great.

08:40.957 --> 08:43.374
<i>She purred, whilst batting</i>
<i>her eyelashes like a flooze.</i>

08:43.376 --> 08:45.659
Yup, I'm engaged
to Louise Marsh,

08:45.661 --> 08:47.428
and our pad's got a Jacuzz!

08:47.430 --> 08:49.663
<i>The bakery spinned,</i>
<i>the floor dropped out.</i>

08:49.665 --> 08:51.382
<i>The air was thick as syrup.</i>

08:51.384 --> 08:53.467
<i>Poor Robin swooned,</i>
<i>she couldn't breathe,</i>

08:53.469 --> 08:55.102
<i>her eyes began to tear up.</i>

08:55.104 --> 08:57.171
<i>And as she tried</i>
<i>to stammer some excuse</i>

08:57.173 --> 08:58.973
<i>to get away, Simon said:</i>

08:58.975 --> 09:01.225
Our wedding cake is
pretty bitchin', eh?

09:01.227 --> 09:04.729
<i>And so was born the worst idea</i>
<i>poor Robin's ever had.</i>

09:04.731 --> 09:07.281
<i>And on Ted's door</i>
<i>there came a rapping.</i>

09:07.283 --> 09:09.350
I did something bad.

09:09.352 --> 09:10.901
<i>As Robin told her tale,</i>

09:10.903 --> 09:13.070
<i>Ted knew</i>
<i>she'd made a massive boo-boo.</i>

09:13.072 --> 09:17.375
<i>For stealing someone's wedding</i>
<i>cake is terribly bad juju.</i>

09:17.377 --> 09:19.877
Robin, I'm beside myself
to see what you've become!

09:19.879 --> 09:21.829
You must return
this cake at once!

09:21.831 --> 09:22.830
I can't!
Why not?

09:22.832 --> 09:24.131
'Cause...

09:24.133 --> 09:25.549
Yum.

09:25.551 --> 09:29.804
<i>Ted gasped, for he had never</i>
<i>seen a brazen act so vicious.</i>

09:29.806 --> 09:31.639
<i>Robin felt remorse, and yet...</i>

09:31.641 --> 09:33.674
Oh, God, this is delicious!

09:33.676 --> 09:37.428
<i>So one piece led to two,</i>
<i>then three, then five, then 17.</i>

09:37.430 --> 09:41.548
<i>She savaged that poor cake</i>
<i>like some rapacious wolverine.</i>

09:41.550 --> 09:44.551
<i>Eating, gobbling, munching,</i>
<i>so the frenzied night wore on.</i>

09:44.553 --> 09:46.354
<i>And by the time</i>
<i>your mom arrived,</i>

09:46.356 --> 09:48.322
<i>the cake was halfway gone.</i>

09:48.324 --> 09:50.074
I came as soon as I got word.

09:50.076 --> 09:51.909
So how bad is the damage?

09:51.911 --> 09:56.113
See for yourself the product
of her cake-in-gullet crammage!

09:56.115 --> 09:57.448
Half a cake?

09:57.450 --> 09:58.849
What have I done?!

09:58.851 --> 10:00.951
The world shall not forgive it!

10:00.953 --> 10:02.703
This day will live in infamy.

10:02.705 --> 10:04.905
I never shall outlive it!

10:04.907 --> 10:06.540
For I have become

10:06.542 --> 10:09.577
the girl that eats her feelings,
don't mistake it.

10:09.579 --> 10:12.763
I think I need to get out
of this chair before I break it.

10:12.765 --> 10:15.516
Nonsense! Hogwash! Balderdash!

10:15.518 --> 10:17.101
<i>Said Mommy, with great fervor.</i>

10:17.103 --> 10:19.920
You can't stop now,
for don't you see?

10:19.922 --> 10:23.757
To the uninformed observer,
you're not some sad cliché,

10:23.759 --> 10:26.977
some loser
from a chick-lit story.

10:26.979 --> 10:30.698
You're Robin, and you're half
a wedding cake away from glory!

10:30.700 --> 10:33.600
If you quit now,
then Simon wins,

10:33.602 --> 10:35.602
the tale comes to a stop

10:35.604 --> 10:38.072
at how you saw
an ex, freaked out,

10:38.074 --> 10:39.790
and robbed a pastry shop.

10:39.792 --> 10:42.410
If you have the guts, my dear,

10:42.412 --> 10:44.628
it's time to get empowered

10:44.630 --> 10:46.797
and be remembered for this

10:46.799 --> 10:49.467
sweet behemoth you devoured.

10:49.469 --> 10:50.718
And years from now,

10:50.720 --> 10:53.671
the troubadour will
raise his voice and sing

10:53.673 --> 10:56.474
of the time that Robin
took the cake.

10:56.476 --> 10:58.509
And ate the whole...

10:58.511 --> 10:59.760
damned...

10:59.762 --> 11:01.095
thing.

11:01.097 --> 11:03.814
MARSHALL: <i>Once more into the breach</i>
<i>she surged,</i>

11:03.816 --> 11:05.466
<i>as Ted and Mommy cheered</i>

11:05.468 --> 11:09.153
<i>and bite by bite the towering</i>
<i>confection disappeared.</i>

11:09.155 --> 11:11.105
<i>Some friends were called</i>
<i>to come and watch.</i>

11:11.107 --> 11:12.690
<i>And no one had to beg.</i>

11:12.692 --> 11:13.974
<i>It soon became a party.</i>

11:13.976 --> 11:15.910
<i>Barney even got a keg.</i>

11:15.912 --> 11:18.996
<i>Forkful after forkful,</i>
<i>Robin guzzled French vanilla</i>

11:18.998 --> 11:21.482
<i>making noises not unlike those</i>
<i>made by a gorilla.</i>

11:21.484 --> 11:23.284
Ooh, ooh, ooh!
Come on, Robin, finish it.

11:23.286 --> 11:26.003
Yeah.
MARSHALL: <i>Mom's exhortations rang</i>

11:26.005 --> 11:29.656
<i>like Apollo coaching Rocky</i>
<i>'gainst a frosted Clubber Lang.</i>

11:29.658 --> 11:31.292
Oh, <i>Rocky IV,</i> my favorite.

11:31.294 --> 11:32.960
No, no, <i>IV</i> is with the Russians.

11:32.962 --> 11:34.828
No, <i>IV's</i> the one
where he talks weird

11:34.830 --> 11:36.347
because of his
concussions.

11:36.349 --> 11:37.798
I think that's all of them.
Hey now,

11:37.800 --> 11:40.551
no need to be discordant.
It's <i>Rocky IV.</i>

11:40.553 --> 11:42.269
No, <i>III.</i>
No, <i>II.</i>

11:42.271 --> 11:44.138
It's really
not important.

11:44.140 --> 11:48.025
<i>At last young Robin raised</i>
<i>the final bite up to her lips</i>

11:48.027 --> 11:49.343
<i>the crowd grew still.</i>

11:49.345 --> 11:51.362
<i>The only sound was Barney</i>

11:51.364 --> 11:53.147
<i>eating chips.</i>
(crunch)

11:54.783 --> 11:56.484
<i>Just one bite left.</i>

11:56.486 --> 11:59.520
Hey, this is like that scene
from <i>Cool Hand Luke.</i> You know,

11:59.522 --> 12:01.405
(Southern accent):
"My boy can eat 50 eggs " Right?

12:01.407 --> 12:03.374
She's gonna puke.

12:04.242 --> 12:05.543
<i>But Robin did not puke.</i>

12:05.545 --> 12:07.795
<i>She ate that bite</i>
<i>and stood up, proud.</i>

12:07.797 --> 12:11.048
(wild cheering, whooping)

12:11.050 --> 12:13.467
Wait. I'm not done yet.

12:13.469 --> 12:15.219
<i>She shouted,</i>
<i>to the startled crowd.</i>

12:15.221 --> 12:17.138
I've bested
this here wedding cake.

12:17.140 --> 12:18.839
I'll gladly wear that crown.

12:18.841 --> 12:20.007
But now that I have

12:20.009 --> 12:22.393
done that task it's time
to wash it down.

12:22.395 --> 12:24.645
For it's been such
an awesome night,

12:24.647 --> 12:27.148
there's just one way
to cap it.

12:27.150 --> 12:29.517
I'm going to drink
this entire keg.

12:30.819 --> 12:32.520
Okay, Barney, tap it.

12:32.522 --> 12:33.838
Oh!
Wow.

12:35.690 --> 12:37.525
Hup.
Ho-o, oh.

12:37.527 --> 12:40.945
MARSHALL: <i>And now that night's remembered</i>
<i>not for Robin getting dumped</i>

12:40.947 --> 12:44.365
but as the night we took her
in to get her stomach pumped.

12:45.033 --> 12:46.417
And look at that,

12:46.419 --> 12:48.902
the little angel's
sleeping soundly, Gus.

12:48.904 --> 12:50.538
Looks like our problems...

12:50.540 --> 12:51.539
Pick a lane!

12:51.541 --> 12:52.756
(honks horn, Marvin cries)

12:52.758 --> 12:56.243
I hate this
stupid bus.

12:58.167 --> 13:01.596
Marvin, I'm afraid
this night is not much of a winner.

13:01.597 --> 13:03.463
Stuck in traffic,
now we've missed

13:03.465 --> 13:05.398
the whole rehearsal dinner.

13:05.400 --> 13:08.335
I pray that I was right
and that you'll have no memory

13:08.337 --> 13:11.488
of this godforsaken ride
down the congested LIE.

13:11.490 --> 13:13.723
At least we know
one thing for sure:

13:13.725 --> 13:15.358
things can't get worse, I swear.

13:15.360 --> 13:17.861
Adios, truck stop
burrito. Ooh!

13:17.863 --> 13:19.579
Do not go in there.

13:19.581 --> 13:23.700
Okay, one more story,
and I'll try to tell it pretty.

13:23.702 --> 13:25.702
The tale of Barney Stinson,

13:25.704 --> 13:28.171
<i>Player King of New York City.</i>

13:33.261 --> 13:36.213
<i>Once upon a time, we all</i>
<i>went out to get our drink on.</i>

13:36.215 --> 13:38.081
<i>When who should</i>
<i>walk in but a girl</i>

13:38.083 --> 13:40.417
<i>with sweater tight and pink on.</i>

13:40.419 --> 13:41.501
<i>She ordered up a beer.</i>

13:41.503 --> 13:43.303
<i>I think you see where</i>
<i>this is going.</i>

13:43.305 --> 13:45.605
<i>As Barney put it,</i>
<i>oh so eloquently:</i>

13:45.607 --> 13:47.340
Boy-oy-oy-oing.

13:47.342 --> 13:51.010
<i>He rose to go approach this</i>
<i>girl commanding such intrigue</i>

13:51.012 --> 13:52.362
<i>when Mommy interrupted:</i>

13:52.364 --> 13:54.447
Dude, she's way
out of your league.

13:54.449 --> 13:58.368
She's not in Daisy Dukes,
nor squeezed into a Hooters tee.

13:58.370 --> 14:00.353
And I don't see a
Curves membership

14:00.355 --> 14:01.821
dangling from
her key.

14:01.823 --> 14:02.855
She has no glaring

14:02.857 --> 14:06.359
spray tan, no
unicorn tattoos.

14:06.361 --> 14:10.530
She's sipping Chardonnay, not pounding
cherry-flavored booze.

14:10.532 --> 14:11.715
Her makeup
isn't running,

14:11.717 --> 14:13.533
she's not playing
with her hair.

14:13.535 --> 14:16.703
There's very little chance
she'll let you put it anywhere.

14:16.705 --> 14:18.922
Your challenge is accepted, Lil.

14:18.924 --> 14:20.974
There is no girl too pretty,

14:20.976 --> 14:22.709
for I am Barney Stinson,

14:22.711 --> 14:25.145
Player King of New York City.

14:25.147 --> 14:27.514
You can't anoint
yourself the king,

14:27.516 --> 14:29.482
just like that jerk, LeBron.

14:29.484 --> 14:31.685
He left the Cavs
three years ago.

14:31.687 --> 14:33.436
Bro, give it
up, move on.

14:33.438 --> 14:34.437
So why

14:34.439 --> 14:35.939
am I king?
Glad you asked.

14:35.941 --> 14:36.990
We didn't.
Never do.

14:36.992 --> 14:38.858
It's origin
story time.

14:38.860 --> 14:41.561
And trust me,
every word is true.

14:41.563 --> 14:45.064
<i>One morning long ago,</i>
<i>I woke up next to a conquest.</i>

14:45.066 --> 14:47.334
<i>So many great things</i>
<i>'bout this girl: her boobs,</i>

14:47.336 --> 14:50.069
<i>her rack, her chest.</i>

14:50.071 --> 14:51.621
<i>She had a thirst for action,</i>

14:51.623 --> 14:53.790
<i>and young Barney</i>
<i>was a-quenchin' it.</i>

14:53.792 --> 14:55.175
Is this important
to the story?

14:55.177 --> 14:56.960
No, just thought
I'd mention it.

14:56.962 --> 15:00.213
<i>As I departed, having bid</i>
<i>this busty babe buh-bye,</i>

15:00.215 --> 15:02.349
<i>I stopped and looked around,</i>
<i>and wondered:</i>

15:02.351 --> 15:03.683
Where the hell am I?

15:03.685 --> 15:06.186
<i>The sign read 22nd Street,</i>
<i>and my concern decreased</i>

15:06.188 --> 15:09.422
<i>until a cold wind</i>
<i>blew a branch aside,</i>

15:09.424 --> 15:10.724
<i>revealing: "East."</i>

15:10.726 --> 15:13.193
The East Side. No.

15:13.195 --> 15:14.427
Wh-What have I done?

15:14.429 --> 15:15.862
<i>I stammered with chagrin.</i>

15:15.864 --> 15:17.614
<i>Just then a black sedan</i>
<i>pulled up...</i>

15:17.616 --> 15:19.316
You Barney?
Yeah.

15:19.318 --> 15:20.867
Get in.
(sighs)

15:20.869 --> 15:22.118
Is any of this true?

15:22.120 --> 15:25.238
Of course. Now,
hang on to your "chayers."

15:25.240 --> 15:27.707
For that day
I was called before...

15:27.709 --> 15:30.293
<i>the High Council of Players.</i>

15:30.295 --> 15:33.713
Gentlemen, for your attendance
here, our deepest thanks.

15:33.715 --> 15:38.001
I'm sad to say, this council
has a poacher in its ranks.

15:38.003 --> 15:39.452
For Barney here

15:39.454 --> 15:41.721
picked up a girl
outside his territory.

15:41.723 --> 15:42.722
The East Side

15:42.724 --> 15:44.391
is Tuxedo Charlie's turf.

15:44.393 --> 15:45.475
He's mad.

15:45.477 --> 15:46.876
True story.

15:46.878 --> 15:50.463
The Agreement of 2004
quite clearly did define

15:50.465 --> 15:53.533
Fifth Avenue to be our hunting
grounds' dividing line.

15:53.535 --> 15:57.988
Your West Side college girls are
not the slip I park my boat in.

15:57.990 --> 15:59.306
So you should know

15:59.308 --> 16:03.209
my East Side debutantes
are quite verboten.

16:03.211 --> 16:05.362
(sighs) Members
of the council...

16:05.364 --> 16:08.147
Bros... nobody wants a war.

16:08.149 --> 16:11.284
Of course I've not
forgotten the agreement of '04.

16:11.286 --> 16:13.086
What can I say? A bonehead move.

16:13.088 --> 16:14.771
Defend it?
I'm not able.

16:14.773 --> 16:17.257
But, bros, have I not been a bro

16:17.259 --> 16:18.842
to each bro at this table?

16:18.844 --> 16:21.094
My friend from Brooklyn,
Pickle Jar Bob,

16:21.096 --> 16:22.846
will give some validation.

16:22.848 --> 16:24.080
Remember that
young tourist

16:24.082 --> 16:26.666
who was looking
for Penn Station?

16:26.668 --> 16:29.386
She'd just come in from Boston,
had a wicked good-in-bed look.

16:29.388 --> 16:33.440
I gave her bad directions
and she ended up in Red Hook.

16:33.442 --> 16:35.392
Shut up, Barney.
Whoa, Bronx Donnie,

16:35.394 --> 16:37.110
let's not get excited.

16:37.112 --> 16:40.347
Tuxedo Charlie's not the only
one here who's been slighted.

16:40.349 --> 16:43.917
You told her you were Jeter
in your quest to lie upon her.

16:43.919 --> 16:46.403
Impersonating Yankees
is my thing.

16:46.405 --> 16:48.071
Have you no honor?

16:48.073 --> 16:50.123
Gentlemen, please,
let's not blow

16:50.125 --> 16:52.075
this détente
to smithereens.

16:52.077 --> 16:54.360
Council recognizes Captain Bill,

16:54.362 --> 16:55.829
our bro from Queens.

16:55.831 --> 16:57.029
Thank you.

16:57.031 --> 16:58.214
You all know me,

16:58.216 --> 16:59.899
and you all
respect my game.

17:01.001 --> 17:03.386
I dress up like a pilot
and meet girls in baggage claim.

17:03.388 --> 17:06.673
And on my long-ass subway ride
from 61st and Woodside,

17:06.675 --> 17:09.759
I came up with a plan to keep you
each other's good side.

17:09.761 --> 17:12.311
Barney,
you have wronged these two.

17:12.314 --> 17:13.646
So, for the game

17:13.647 --> 17:15.882
they're losing,
you now must grant them each

17:15.884 --> 17:18.401
a West Side hottie
of their choosing.

17:18.403 --> 17:19.469
You're kidding.

17:19.471 --> 17:20.904
That's the settlement?

17:20.906 --> 17:22.839
Come on, that's rather silly.
Gentlemen,

17:22.840 --> 17:23.857
what say you?

17:23.858 --> 17:24.858
I want Robin.

17:24.859 --> 17:25.825
I want Lily.

17:25.827 --> 17:27.861
Please. Bronx Donnie?

17:27.863 --> 17:30.196
No chance he could
get me in the sack.

17:30.198 --> 17:33.083
Tell that Mafioso I know
something he can whack.

17:33.085 --> 17:34.567
Ladies, don't
you worry,

17:34.569 --> 17:36.736
your fair legs can
all stay closed.

17:36.738 --> 17:38.037
'Cause luckily
they took

17:38.039 --> 17:41.040
the counteroffer
I proposed.

17:41.042 --> 17:42.342
Well, gentlemen,

17:42.344 --> 17:44.194
it seems there's nothing
I can say to sway you.

17:44.196 --> 17:45.528
Charlie, Donnie,

17:45.530 --> 17:47.380
say no more,
I gladly will repay you.

17:47.382 --> 17:49.599
Carlotta, some champagne.

17:49.601 --> 17:53.470
Let's toast before
we all adjourn.

17:55.639 --> 17:57.891
To boobies.

17:59.426 --> 18:00.643
Oh, and B-T-dub,

18:00.645 --> 18:02.395
y'all just drank poison.

18:02.397 --> 18:03.530
Ha-burn.

18:03.532 --> 18:05.064
(gags)

18:13.273 --> 18:15.575
(maniacal laugh)

18:20.631 --> 18:23.082
And thus, my friends,
I have become,

18:23.084 --> 18:25.117
through methods somewhat gory

18:25.119 --> 18:27.837
the Player King
of New York City.

18:27.839 --> 18:29.005
Boom.

18:29.007 --> 18:31.290
The end.

18:31.292 --> 18:32.642
True story.

18:32.644 --> 18:34.144
Well, that was great.

18:34.146 --> 18:36.095
Your little story
tickled all our ribs.

18:36.097 --> 18:38.014
But one mistake
you made, sir,

18:38.016 --> 18:40.400
was forgetting
to call dibs.

18:40.402 --> 18:41.067
(gasps)

18:41.069 --> 18:42.468
BARNEY:
No! Not fair.

18:42.470 --> 18:44.103
But I'm the king.

18:44.105 --> 18:46.990
And such a better dresser.
TED: Sorry, dude,

18:46.992 --> 18:48.408
but that's revenge

18:48.410 --> 18:51.110
for Lisa the professor.
(chuckles)

18:51.112 --> 18:52.195
(giggles)

18:52.197 --> 18:53.613
Let's have
another round.

18:53.615 --> 18:54.831
Yes.
MARSHALL: <i>Your mommy said.</i>

18:54.833 --> 18:56.616
<i>And so we had one.</i>

18:56.618 --> 18:58.501
<i>The night wore on,</i>
<i>and I must say,</i>

18:58.503 --> 19:00.453
<i>it wasn't a half bad one.</i>

19:00.455 --> 19:02.755
<i>What memories.</i>
<i>Our young and happy hearts</i>

19:02.757 --> 19:05.592
<i>were hot as fire.</i>

19:05.594 --> 19:08.711
Feels like a lifetime
since those days.

19:10.347 --> 19:12.465
(loud bump)
BUS DRIVER: Sorry, folks,

19:12.467 --> 19:13.933
flat tire.

19:13.935 --> 19:15.435
(Marvin cries)
Oh, come on.

19:15.437 --> 19:17.937
Now I'm never gonna
make it to Nantucket.

19:17.939 --> 19:20.006
(Marvin continues wailing)

19:21.942 --> 19:25.728
(explosions)

19:25.730 --> 19:27.647
Oh, look a
fireworks display.

19:27.649 --> 19:29.232
Some rockets
red glare action.

19:29.234 --> 19:30.516
Thank God.

19:30.518 --> 19:34.120
Thought my glaucoma drops
were causing a reaction.

19:34.122 --> 19:38.241
Marvin, I'm so sorry this
whole journey's been a bummer.

19:38.243 --> 19:43.329
Soon you'll be right back in
Mommy's arms, as warm as summer.

19:43.331 --> 19:46.916
But sadly while your troubles
stop once we get to the inn

19:46.918 --> 19:50.303
the moment we arrive
is when my troubles will begin.

19:50.305 --> 19:52.922
Sometimes daddies screw up,

19:52.924 --> 19:55.558
sometimes mommies get upset.

19:55.560 --> 19:59.062
I really hope this weekend
is a memory you'll forget.

19:59.064 --> 20:02.565
So look up at those fireworks,
enjoy the falling embers...

20:02.567 --> 20:06.185
NARRATOR: <i>And that, kids,</i>
<i>is the very first thing</i>

20:06.187 --> 20:09.656
<i>your cousin</i>
<i>Marvin remembers.</i>

20:12.119 --> 20:15.355
Gentlemen and ladies,
it'll be an hour or so...

20:15.356 --> 20:17.440
(groans) before the truck
gets here to give our

20:17.442 --> 20:19.141
broken bus a tow.

20:19.143 --> 20:22.862
So in the meantime I suggest
we all get nice and cozy.

20:22.864 --> 20:25.448
We're gonna be here
for a while.

20:26.950 --> 20:29.418
Uh, ring-around-the-rosy?

20:29.420 --> 20:31.420
Yeah!

20:31.422 --> 20:34.823
How far do you suppose it is
to the Farhampton Inn?

20:34.825 --> 20:36.792
I'd say about five miles away.

20:36.794 --> 20:38.511
Oh, no.

20:38.513 --> 20:39.962
What's with the grin?

20:39.964 --> 20:42.164
NARRATOR: <i>Then Marshall</i>
<i>looked up heavenward,</i>

20:42.166 --> 20:44.050
<i>and swore by night's first star</i>

20:44.052 --> 20:46.469
<i>five simple words</i>
<i>he'd soon regret:</i>

20:46.471 --> 20:47.937
I can walk that far.
