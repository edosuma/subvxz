- Yeah, it's nice.

Get this. I'm living
with this chick, right?

16:14.156 --> 16:17.115

her in bed with another girl.

16:17.198 --> 16:19.156
I was "No," I couldn't
believe it, you know.

16:19.240 --> 16:22.156

like that. Unbelievable.

- Oh, that's very personal..

just stiffs and stuff?

16:30.198 --> 16:31.990

- Can I take a peek?

16:32.073 --> 16:33.365
- Sure.
- Alright.

- Hey, this Carboni guy.

or what?

16:36.907 --> 16:39.657

He's not here at night.

and the stiffs alone here?

half an hour. Are you okay?

to this all week.

come to bed?

17:15.073 --> 17:18.156

six more pounds.'

run into bed?

17:22.448 --> 17:25.573

pounds along the way.

Just don't look at me.'

17:29.490 --> 17:31.657

- 'Are the lights out, Chuck?'

17:31.740 --> 17:33.615
Yes. Yes!

- Sure.

17:55.824 --> 17:59.198
Could you just check
the apartment?

17:59.281 --> 18:01.865

the apartment every time?

- What music?

19:08.865 --> 19:11.156
- That music.
- What music?

19:11.240 --> 19:13.740
Chuck!

19:13.824 --> 19:16.156
It's just a little loud music.

19:17.198 --> 19:19.198
Well, it bothers me.

are they doing?

get fully dressed?

21:28.031 --> 21:29.824
It wasn't going to be
any good tonight, anyway.

21:29.907 --> 21:33.240
I feel so guilty.

21:33.323 --> 21:35.573
I cheated today.

- I had a Nestle's Crunch bar.

Twenty one.
What's the matter?

22:45.532 --> 22:48.031
Oh, I ordered egg salad.
They sent me tuna fish.

22:48.115 --> 22:49.699
Every night, they send you
the wrong food and you eat it.

22:49.782 --> 22:51.365
Send it back.
Get what you want.

22:51.448 --> 22:54.699

You know, that's alright.

to cure cancer.

23:09.448 --> 23:11.782
No. Tuna fish.

23:13.490 --> 23:15.156
What if you mix mayonnaise

with the tuna fish?

in and take all the credit.

28:02.949 --> 28:04.323
So I get up and I yelled
at the dealer, right.

28:04.407 --> 28:05.990
So, he goes over
to the pit boss.

28:06.073 --> 28:07.782
So, I threw my complimentary
worned out drink

28:07.865 --> 28:09.657
right in his fat face.

28:09.740 --> 28:10.990
[mimicking explosion]

28:11.073 --> 28:14.657
So they barred me for being
too good a player.

28:14.740 --> 28:16.615
Think I'll go to Vegas
next week.

28:16.699 --> 28:18.949
I wish you would shut up.

28:19.031 --> 28:21.073
Vegas knows how to treat you
right, you know, Chuck.

28:21.156 --> 28:23.699
'Cause its got broads,
you know, Wayne Newton.

28:23.782 --> 28:25.865
Got him. He's an Indian.
Did you know that?

28:25.949 --> 28:27.657
Would you do me a favor.

28:27.740 --> 28:31.490
Would you please shut up?

28:31.573 --> 28:35.156
- You telling me to shut up?
- I'm telling you to shut up.

28:35.240 --> 28:38.699
I'm.. I'll tell your recorder,
so that you don't forget.

28:38.782 --> 28:43.490
Hello. This is Chuck,
to remind Bill to shut up!

28:43.573 --> 28:44.740
You know,
this used to be

28:44.824 --> 28:46.532
such a quiet place
before you got here.

28:46.615 --> 28:48.699
You talk too much.

28:48.782 --> 28:52.365
Edible paper, feeding
mayonnaise to tuna fish.

28:52.448 --> 28:55.490
I will give you a quarter
if you just stop talking.

28:58.490 --> 29:00.448
Thank you.

29:19.865 --> 29:21.824
I thought
we were friends.

29:33.782 --> 29:34.740
(male voice on recorder)
'Hello, this is Chuck'

29:34.824 --> 29:37.949
'to remind Bill
to shut up!'

29:38.031 --> 29:39.865
[recorder rewinding]
'Hello, this is Chuck'

29:39.949 --> 29:43.031
'to remind Bill
to shut up!'

29:43.115 --> 29:45.240
[recorder rewinding]
'Hello, this is Chuck'

29:45.323 --> 29:48.281
'to remind Bill
to shut up!'

29:48.365 --> 29:51.615
[recorder rewinding]
'Bill to shut up!'

29:51.699 --> 29:53.615
[recorder rewinding]
'Hello, this is Chuck'

29:53.699 --> 29:57.115
'to remind Bill
to shut up!'

29:57.198 --> 29:59.615
'Bill to shut up!'

29:59.699 --> 30:01.115
'To shut up!'

30:01.198 --> 30:02.824
'Shut up!'

30:02.907 --> 30:05.240
- Sorry that I yelled at you.
- 'To shut..'

30:08.699 --> 30:10.782
You think it's
been easy on me?

30:10.865 --> 30:14.782
I come in here, I'm the new guy
with no friends.

30:14.865 --> 30:17.407
I confide in you my whole life.

30:17.490 --> 30:19.824
I tell you my deepest,
most intimate stuff.

30:19.907 --> 30:22.532
You share anything with me?

30:24.073 --> 30:27.657
I see a picture of
your fiance, every day.

30:27.740 --> 30:30.115
You didn't even
tell me her name.

30:32.031 --> 30:34.532
- Gave you $100.
- I didn't ask for it.

30:34.615 --> 30:37.281
That's what made it such
a beautiful gesture on my part.

30:37.365 --> 30:38.990
Never mind, forget it.

30:39.073 --> 30:40.657
We'll work together every night
like strangers.

30:40.740 --> 30:42.699
That's fine with me.

30:57.407 --> 30:58.615
Charlotte.

31:00.115 --> 31:02.156
What?

31:02.240 --> 31:04.782
My fiance's name is Charlotte.

31:11.490 --> 31:14.448
[instrumental music]

31:47.281 --> 31:48.615
Oh, my God.

31:49.699 --> 31:51.156
Oh, hi, Chuck.

31:53.615 --> 31:55.907
What happened, did you fall
down? Did somebody hit you?

31:55.990 --> 31:57.407
It's the other way around.

31:57.490 --> 31:59.865
Somebody hit me
and then I fell down.

31:59.949 --> 32:01.532
Wish I had my handkerchief,
I always have my handkerchief--

32:01.615 --> 32:02.740
Uh, I got a tissue
in my purse.

32:02.824 --> 32:04.782
No, no, no, no.
Please, let me do it.

32:09.490 --> 32:11.198
Hi, listen, do you
have a handkerchief?

32:11.281 --> 32:13.740
- Mugger! Mugger!
- No, I need your handkerchief.

32:13.824 --> 32:15.532
[blowing a whistle]

32:15.615 --> 32:17.532
[children clamoring]

32:17.615 --> 32:20.407
No! Oh, no, no.

32:20.490 --> 32:21.824
No!

32:22.865 --> 32:24.490
[indistinct]

32:25.782 --> 32:27.115
[whistle]

32:35.907 --> 32:37.240
Thank you.

32:38.865 --> 32:40.281
You know, this was
the first time

32:40.365 --> 32:44.115
I was ever beaten up by
a bunch of Bluebells.

32:44.198 --> 32:46.323
I didn't like it.

32:46.407 --> 32:47.615
How are you?

32:47.699 --> 32:50.782
Oh, I'm great.

32:50.865 --> 32:53.740
Four pounds of make up, they'll
never know the difference.

32:53.824 --> 32:56.115
Can I ask you a question?

32:56.198 --> 32:59.615
I wouldn't do it with the guy
until he...paid me.

32:59.699 --> 33:02.073
So...he beat me up.

33:04.031 --> 33:05.615
That's what happens
when you don't have a pimp.

33:05.699 --> 33:07.448
Some guys figure
why should they pay?

33:07.532 --> 33:10.240
That guy in the morgue,
he was your pimp, right?

33:10.323 --> 33:12.073
Yeah

33:12.156 --> 33:15.699
A lot of Franklin's ladies
are in the same boat.

33:15.782 --> 33:18.448
We could find
another pimp, but..

33:18.532 --> 33:21.448
...some of those guys
are real rough.

33:21.532 --> 33:24.156
Get the girls hooked on dope.

33:24.240 --> 33:26.949
Drugs or beat-up,
it's a nice choice.

33:27.031 --> 33:30.615
You could do something
different, you're very bright.

33:30.699 --> 33:34.323
Is head okay, because, uh..

33:34.407 --> 33:36.198
...I'm real tired.

33:37.615 --> 33:40.198
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.
Thank you.

33:41.281 --> 33:43.073
Thanks very much.

33:45.615 --> 33:48.073
I hope everything
turns out alright.

33:49.240 --> 33:51.615
- See you in the halls.
- Yeah.

33:57.615 --> 33:58.782
Ouch!

34:00.907 --> 34:02.782
[dog barking]

34:05.573 --> 34:08.907
(Chuck)
'Go back home. No, no!'

34:08.989 --> 34:10.447
[door banging shut]

34:18.657 --> 34:20.989
So she was just lying there
in the elevator?

34:21.072 --> 34:23.407
She was all beat up.

34:23.489 --> 34:25.407
See, that's why they have pimps.

34:25.489 --> 34:26.699
You know, that's what she said.

34:26.782 --> 34:27.989
She knows this whole bunch of

34:28.072 --> 34:30.322
girlfriends that need pimps.

34:30.407 --> 34:33.407
I really hope they find
someone trustworthy.

34:33.489 --> 34:36.031
- Ha ha ha, are you crazy?
- No.

34:36.114 --> 34:37.739
Those guys are killers.

34:37.824 --> 34:39.572
They're animals.

34:39.657 --> 34:41.532
They dress nice though.

34:46.281 --> 34:48.447
Wait a minute.
Hold the phone, Chuck.

34:48.532 --> 34:51.239
We got all that space
down at the morgue.

34:51.322 --> 34:55.447
All those cars, all that time
at night, nobody watchin' us.

34:55.532 --> 34:57.448
We could handle things
for your next-door neighbor

34:57.532 --> 34:59.990
and all her girlfriends
right out of the morgue!

35:01.615 --> 35:02.907
Pimps?

35:02.990 --> 35:05.115
Are you saying
we should become pimps?

35:05.198 --> 35:08.365
"Pimps" is an ugly word.

35:08.448 --> 35:10.198
We could call ourselves
"lovebrokers."

35:10.281 --> 35:12.240
This is my stop, you
think about it, okay?

35:12.323 --> 35:13.615
I really think this
is the one, Chuck.

35:13.699 --> 35:15.865
I am excited about this,
I mean it.

35:15.949 --> 35:17.532
This is it, I think.

35:17.615 --> 35:18.990
Lovebrokers.

35:21.198 --> 35:24.782
Lovebrokers, ha ha ha.

35:24.865 --> 35:26.281
You and me, buddy!

35:26.365 --> 35:28.240
You're over the rainbow, pal.

35:28.323 --> 35:31.198
[saxophone music]

36:01.615 --> 36:03.365
Lovebrokers.

36:03.448 --> 36:04.907
[knocking on door]

36:07.073 --> 36:08.782
- Hi, Chuck.
- Hi.

36:08.865 --> 36:11.532
Uh, listen, last week,
when you helped me

36:11.615 --> 36:14.031
I think I got a little rude
right before you left.

36:14.115 --> 36:15.699
Oh, no, you didn't.
Oh, no.

36:15.782 --> 36:17.156
Well, anyway.

36:17.240 --> 36:19.031
Um. I noticed that
you and I come home

36:19.115 --> 36:21.657
from work at the same time
every day.

36:21.740 --> 36:24.240
I thought maybe we might start
having breakfast together.

36:26.573 --> 36:28.323
You got any eggs?

36:28.407 --> 36:30.615
I practically have
a whole dairy in here.

36:30.699 --> 36:32.031
Great.

36:33.573 --> 36:37.490
Ah, gee,
your place is beautiful!

36:37.573 --> 36:40.281
And it's warm!
My place is freezing.

36:40.365 --> 36:43.657
And you got a kitchen, huh?
And you got eggs.

36:43.740 --> 36:45.156
Uh, how do you like your eggs?

36:45.240 --> 36:47.073
- Uh, scrambled.
- Of course!

36:47.156 --> 36:50.156
- Men love scrambled.
- I didn't know that.

36:50.240 --> 36:52.115
- Yeah.
- Men love scrambled.

36:59.115 --> 37:01.031
[grunting]
Oh!

37:01.115 --> 37:03.490
Chuck, does the window open?

37:03.573 --> 37:06.490
Oh, no, I-I'm real sorry,
it's painted shut.

37:06.573 --> 37:07.907
Makes sense, doesn't it?

37:07.990 --> 37:09.949
That's where the fire escape is.

37:11.657 --> 37:13.865
Is there a-a vent
or a fan or anything?

37:13.949 --> 37:15.824
Oh, no, I'm real sorry,
that room just catches

37:15.907 --> 37:17.490
all the heat in the morning.

37:17.573 --> 37:18.949
It's okay.

37:24.615 --> 37:27.323
Well, you know,
it's worse in the summer.

37:32.365 --> 37:34.198
My God!

37:34.281 --> 37:36.073
Uh, I'll put my robe back on.

37:36.156 --> 37:37.907
Uh, no, no, don't.

37:37.990 --> 37:40.907
Uh, what I mean is..

37:40.990 --> 37:43.240
...that you should
be comfortable.

37:43.323 --> 37:44.782
Uh, I am.

37:45.782 --> 37:46.907
Okay.

37:46.990 --> 37:48.615
[telephone ringing]

37:50.031 --> 37:52.490
I'll get that.
It's probably for me.

37:56.365 --> 37:57.865
Hello.

37:59.031 --> 38:00.365
Charlotte.

38:00.448 --> 38:02.281
Why'd you call me?

38:02.365 --> 38:04.573
What's the matter?

38:04.657 --> 38:06.240
You ate what?

38:06.323 --> 38:09.448
Well, that's okay,
just don't do it again.

38:09.532 --> 38:10.907
'What do you mean,
what am I doing?'

38:10.990 --> 38:12.990
'I'm not doing anything.'

38:13.073 --> 38:14.615
Well, of course
I sound strange

38:14.699 --> 38:16.240
if you call me up early
in the morning and you say

38:16.323 --> 38:18.699
what am I doing and
I'm not doing anything.

38:20.031 --> 38:21.573
Oh, my God.

38:21.657 --> 38:23.532
I just stepped on a tack.

38:24.907 --> 38:27.031
Yeah. I love you too.

38:28.073 --> 38:29.990
Eggs comin' right up.

38:30.073 --> 38:31.615
You know, I was thinking

38:31.699 --> 38:34.073
about the last time
that we were together.

38:34.156 --> 38:35.740
And I was wondering..

38:35.824 --> 38:38.782
...have-have you been able
to find, you know, a, um..

38:38.865 --> 38:40.156
- A pimp?
- Yeah.

38:40.240 --> 38:41.615
No.

38:41.699 --> 38:43.448
I have to, though.

38:43.532 --> 38:45.615
- This way's too dangerous.
- Yeah.

38:45.699 --> 38:47.865
- Lupe, she's my friend.
- Yeah.

38:47.949 --> 38:49.907
She got her arm broke last week.

38:51.407 --> 38:53.824
What a sick world!

38:53.907 --> 38:55.365
Yeah. Thank God.

39:00.907 --> 39:03.699
You know, we could do
this every morning.

39:03.782 --> 39:06.240
At least until you
get tired of eggs.

39:09.907 --> 39:12.365
Boy, it is hot in here.

39:13.699 --> 39:16.031
[upbeat music on the radio]

39:16.907 --> 39:18.824
You got any bread?

39:18.907 --> 39:21.448
I'm sorry, I must've left
my money at home.

39:21.532 --> 39:23.156
It's in my other pants, I think.

39:23.240 --> 39:26.031
There you go.
$4.90 of $5?

39:26.115 --> 39:27.323
Keep the dime,
it's alright.

39:27.407 --> 39:29.407
I'll take these.
Come on.

39:33.281 --> 39:35.323
- They gave me the wrong bread.
- Ah?

39:35.407 --> 39:37.365
I asked for for wheat,
they gave me white.

39:37.448 --> 39:38.824
So send it back. Hey,
you gave him white bread.

39:38.907 --> 39:40.532
No, don't make a fuss,
don't make a fuss.

39:40.615 --> 39:42.865
My mother said, you send it
back, the chef spits on it.

39:42.949 --> 39:44.573
- Really?
- Turkey, turkey!

39:44.657 --> 39:47.031
Come get your turkeys.

39:47.115 --> 39:48.323
(Bill)
'Immoral?'

39:48.407 --> 39:50.031
What do you mean, immoral?

39:50.115 --> 39:52.198
As a matter of fact,
prostitution is

39:52.281 --> 39:54.740
probably one of the most
moral things in the world.

39:56.448 --> 39:57.865
How did you figure that out?

39:57.949 --> 40:00.073
Simple. You take a guy.

40:00.156 --> 40:02.198
He's in from out of town.
Let's say that guy.

40:02.281 --> 40:04.365
'Okay, he's in from out of town
and he's here on business.'

40:04.448 --> 40:08.198
Alright, he's waiting for his
wife, and two or three children.

40:08.281 --> 40:10.699
Hey, he's got urges, alright.

40:10.782 --> 40:12.407
Let's say he goes in
to see this picture.

40:12.490 --> 40:14.240
Which, by the way,
is not a bad movie.

40:14.323 --> 40:17.532
Anyway, let's say this
picture stimulates his, uh..

40:17.615 --> 40:18.949
Urges.

40:19.031 --> 40:20.407
Good word. Alright.

40:20.490 --> 40:22.573
Now, he's on the street
again, right?

40:22.657 --> 40:24.407
Okay, he is a loaded pistol.

40:24.490 --> 40:26.365
He's like
Mount St. Helens, alright.

40:26.448 --> 40:28.907
Who walks by, but a Girl Scout
swinging her cookies?

40:28.990 --> 40:30.573
Her little cookies.
Girl Scouts of America

40:30.657 --> 40:33.573
he goes bananas,
he's on her like mud on a pig.

40:33.657 --> 40:36.573
That wouldn't have happened
if he'd gone to a hooker, right?

40:36.657 --> 40:39.573
So, you call that moral?
He goes jumps on a Girl Scout

40:39.657 --> 40:42.281
and breaks her cookies,
you call that moral?

40:44.031 --> 40:46.490
You figured that all out
just by yourself?

40:47.824 --> 40:49.073
I have that kind of mind, yeah.

40:49.156 --> 40:51.865
Yes, you do, Bill.
Yes, you do.

40:53.532 --> 40:55.448
So let's do it!

40:55.532 --> 40:56.865
Okay now?

40:58.407 --> 40:59.990
Yeah, nice.

41:00.073 --> 41:01.824
But isn't this
a little high, Angelo?

41:01.907 --> 41:03.824
That's the way I always do it.

41:03.907 --> 41:05.949
- You like it that way.
- I do?

41:06.031 --> 41:07.615
- Yeah.
- Yeah, alright, I do.

41:07.699 --> 41:10.073
- Hi! How you doin'?
- Hi. Alright.

41:10.156 --> 41:11.490
Hey, Chuck, what are you,
like, getting a haircut?

41:11.573 --> 41:14.115
No, I just like wearing sheets.

41:14.198 --> 41:15.281
Hey, look at this,
what'd I tell you?

41:15.365 --> 41:16.824
"Girl Scout attacked."

41:16.907 --> 41:18.281
In the paper, right there.

41:18.365 --> 41:19.615
- Could I see that again?
- Yeah.

41:19.699 --> 41:22.615
Right there.
"Girl Scout attacked."

41:22.699 --> 41:24.949
"Girl Scout attacked by dog."

41:25.031 --> 41:26.949
"Dog." A guy from out of town,
what's the difference, Chuck?

41:27.031 --> 41:28.615
There's a very big difference.

41:28.699 --> 41:31.281
One carries an attache case,
the other urinates on a tree.

41:31.365 --> 41:33.824
Hey, what are you doin' here?
What is this? A haircut?

41:33.907 --> 41:35.532
You call that.. Look at these
sideburns. Even them out!

41:35.615 --> 41:38.365
Man's gonna have a razor in his
hands, let us not get him angry.

41:38.448 --> 41:40.323
Chuck, I know, but you've
got a sideburn up here.

41:40.407 --> 41:43.699
- Another down Fort Lauderdale.
- He is a seasoned professional.

41:43.782 --> 41:45.156
Do you want your friend

41:45.240 --> 41:46.990
Belinda working for
one of those animals?

41:47.073 --> 41:50.198
You want her to be,
what, Ms. Heroin, 1982?

41:50.281 --> 41:52.323
Charlotte's parents are
coming in for Thanksgiving.

41:52.407 --> 41:55.323
I really need to
get this haircut.

41:55.407 --> 41:57.990
Oh, yeah. You know. You know.

41:58.073 --> 42:00.323
Yeah, that's it.
Get the haircut.

42:00.407 --> 42:03.156
Get all your hair cut.

42:03.240 --> 42:04.949
All you ever think
about is yourself.

42:05.031 --> 42:06.657
You don't care about
what happens to me.

42:06.740 --> 42:08.532
You don't care what
happens to Belinda.

42:08.615 --> 42:11.532
You don't care what happens
to the Girl Scouts of America!

42:11.615 --> 42:16.240
America! I'm fed up, man.
I'm fed up with you.

42:16.323 --> 42:18.907
I wash my hands
and my feet of you.

42:21.323 --> 42:23.824
Trim that!

42:29.782 --> 42:32.031
(Chuck)
'Mr. and Mrs. Koogle,
would you care for a drink?'

42:32.115 --> 42:34.657
Mrs. Koogle and I do not drink.

42:34.740 --> 42:36.073
Of course.

42:39.740 --> 42:42.031
So, how do you like
our fair city?

42:42.115 --> 42:43.990
Oh, we don't.

42:44.073 --> 42:46.448
Well, perhaps if you drank,
you would.

42:51.156 --> 42:53.990
Mom? Is dinner almost ready?

42:54.073 --> 42:56.407
Turkey's almost dead.

42:56.490 --> 42:58.448
[telephone ringing]

43:00.490 --> 43:02.573
Hello.

43:02.657 --> 43:06.073
Hi, Happy Thanksgiving.

43:06.156 --> 43:08.448
- Arrested?
- Chuck, I'm really sorry.

43:08.532 --> 43:10.990
I-I called the landlady
and she wasn't home.

43:12.865 --> 43:14.407
They've taking me
into night court, and

43:14.490 --> 43:16.865
all my ID, and all my money
are in my apartment.

43:16.949 --> 43:18.532
(both women)
Oh, beautiful.

43:18.615 --> 43:21.740
Belinda. This is not
a good evening for me.

43:21.824 --> 43:24.407
My entire family is here
for Thanksgiving.

43:24.490 --> 43:26.532
Chuck, please!

43:26.615 --> 43:29.031
Franklin used to take care
of all these things.

43:29.115 --> 43:30.782
I don't know what
they're gonna do to me.

43:30.865 --> 43:32.532
Okay. Okay.

43:32.615 --> 43:35.615
Don't cry. I'll be there
as soon as I can get there.

43:35.699 --> 43:37.907
Okay. Thanks.

43:38.031 --> 43:39.156
Thanks a lot.

43:39.240 --> 43:40.573
Bye-bye.

43:42.824 --> 43:44.740
Have you seen the lights
out at night?

43:44.824 --> 43:47.407
No wonder this
city's going broke.

43:47.490 --> 43:49.949
Ha ha ha ha.

43:50.031 --> 43:52.782
I have to go out, and
I'll be back in a minute, okay?

43:52.865 --> 43:55.323
What? Where're you going?

43:58.865 --> 44:00.740
[indistinct chatter]

44:07.031 --> 44:08.615
You absolutely didn't
have to come with me.

44:08.699 --> 44:10.281
I would've been home
in 10 minutes.

44:10.365 --> 44:12.657
Well, we had the rental car,
paid an arm and a leg for it.

44:12.740 --> 44:15.073
Might as well use it.
You wanna 'scuse me, sonny.

44:15.156 --> 44:17.407
I wanna know
why she called you.

44:17.490 --> 44:19.824
She's my neighbor.

44:19.907 --> 44:21.115
Excuse me.

44:27.407 --> 44:28.740
(Judge)
'Uh, next case.'

44:33.740 --> 44:36.198
That's his neighbor.

44:42.907 --> 44:46.490
Belinda Keaton, you are charged
with prostitution and assault.

44:46.573 --> 44:48.448
Not guilty, Your Honor.

44:48.532 --> 44:49.990
- Not guilty?
- Not guilty.

44:50.073 --> 44:52.156
Not guilty? Your Honor,
this woman's a menace.

44:52.240 --> 44:55.156
Uh, you are one
Howard, uh, Pelekoudas?

44:55.240 --> 44:56.990
Yes, sir. I'm the victim.

44:57.073 --> 44:58.490
You're an asshole.

44:58.573 --> 45:01.156
[laughter]

45:01.240 --> 45:05.532
Be that as it may,
uh, can we proceed?

45:05.615 --> 45:10.657
Mr. Pelekoudas and I had just
completed a business transaction

45:10.740 --> 45:14.198
at which point, Mr. Pelekoudas
attempted to forcibly exact

45:14.281 --> 45:17.865
a refund when services
had already been rendered.

45:17.949 --> 45:20.031
- Tried to grab his money back.
- Yeah.

45:20.115 --> 45:22.031
Yes, that's when
she assaulted me.

45:22.115 --> 45:23.990
Mr. Pelekoudas, uh, you look

45:24.073 --> 45:26.990
unmarked, undamaged
to me in any manner.

45:27.073 --> 45:28.240
Oh, yeah?

45:30.448 --> 45:33.365
Well, feast your eyes on this.

45:33.448 --> 45:35.365
[audience gasping]

45:35.448 --> 45:38.865
(Howard)
'Exhibit A! She bit me!'

45:38.949 --> 45:40.824
What about my feelings?

45:45.323 --> 45:47.490
'What about my feelings?'

45:49.657 --> 45:52.865
You wanna know what
really steams my bean?

45:52.949 --> 45:55.073
They let that strumpet
right back out on the street.

45:55.156 --> 45:56.365
You're moving
outta that building.

45:56.448 --> 45:57.699
Absolutely.

45:57.782 --> 45:59.281
Why are you friends
with that girl?

45:59.365 --> 46:00.615
She's my neighbor.

46:00.699 --> 46:02.115
She happens to be
a very nice girl.

46:02.198 --> 46:03.615
Oh, but she's a Harlot.

46:03.699 --> 46:05.865
- Now wait a minute--
- You stay out of it.

46:05.949 --> 46:07.407
Let me tell you
something, Charlotte.

46:07.490 --> 46:09.073
When you get married, you're
going to have to handle him

46:09.156 --> 46:11.240
just the way
I handled his father.

46:11.323 --> 46:12.365
[groaning]

46:12.448 --> 46:14.532
(Mr. Koogle)
Damn potholes.

46:14.615 --> 46:16.281
You alright, Rose?

46:16.365 --> 46:17.699
If it wasn't for me,
his father would have done

46:17.782 --> 46:19.198
any old thing he pleased.

46:19.281 --> 46:20.532
You know what he wanted to do?

46:20.615 --> 46:23.532
Make furniture. By hand!

46:23.615 --> 46:26.115
Don't worry, Mr. and Mrs.
Koogle, I straightened out Al

46:26.198 --> 46:28.365
and together, we'll all
straighten out Chuck.

46:31.323 --> 46:33.198
(Mr. Koogle)
'You alright, Rose?'

46:35.990 --> 46:37.448
[car honking]

46:37.532 --> 46:39.615
[cat screeching]

46:39.699 --> 46:42.573
[rock music]

46:44.990 --> 46:46.699
[doorbell ringing]

46:54.490 --> 46:57.115
Bill?

46:57.198 --> 46:59.615
- Bill?
- Hey, my bud!

46:59.699 --> 47:01.782
I have to tell you
something very important.

47:01.865 --> 47:03.782
Come on in.

47:03.865 --> 47:05.323
How'd you get in, Chuck?

47:05.407 --> 47:06.990
This is a, uh,
security building.

47:07.073 --> 47:09.448
I'm gonna have to
talk to that guy.

47:13.573 --> 47:16.281
(Bill screaming)
'Yeeaah, way to go!'

47:18.740 --> 47:20.990
What are we really
talking about here?

47:21.073 --> 47:22.657
Huh?

47:22.740 --> 47:27.657
What's the essence...of what
we're talking about?

47:27.740 --> 47:30.532
I'll spell it out for
you if I have to.

47:37.073 --> 47:38.990
Prostitution!

47:39.073 --> 47:41.365
[indistinct muttering]

47:42.740 --> 47:44.699
Prostitution.

47:44.782 --> 47:46.156
Hey, we can say it.

47:46.240 --> 47:48.031
We're big kids now, right?

47:48.115 --> 47:49.532
You know, a lot of times
it'll help you

47:49.615 --> 47:51.240
to understand a word
if you break it down.

47:51.323 --> 47:53.490
So let's do that now, shall we?

47:53.573 --> 47:55.031
"Pros."

47:55.115 --> 47:57.323
Doesn't mean anything.
Forget about that.

47:57.407 --> 47:59.740
"Tit." I think we all know
what that means.

47:59.824 --> 48:02.240
"Tu." Okay, "tu."

48:02.323 --> 48:06.365
And "tion," of course,
from the, um, Latin..

48:06.448 --> 48:08.824
..."to shun."

48:08.907 --> 48:11.657
Say, "No. Uh-uh. Thank you
anyway, I don't want it."

48:11.740 --> 48:14.198
"To push away."

48:14.281 --> 48:15.740
Doesn't even belong
in this word, really

48:15.824 --> 48:18.865
so let's get rid of that.

48:18.949 --> 48:21.532
You know, um..

48:21.615 --> 48:23.657
...if I could take
a moment here, uh..

48:23.740 --> 48:26.573
...and I mean this,
what I'm about to say.

48:26.657 --> 48:29.115
I feel a lot of love
in this room.

48:31.156 --> 48:32.740
I don't know, maybe it's me,
but I'll you something

48:32.824 --> 48:34.198
it was here a minute ago.

48:34.281 --> 48:36.865
And, uh, it was
really beautiful.

48:36.949 --> 48:38.407
So at this moment I think
it's important that I see

48:38.490 --> 48:41.031
all of your breasts.

48:41.115 --> 48:43.407
Or I don't have to.
I don't see your breasts.

48:43.490 --> 48:46.281
Come on, let's get out of here,
this guy's no pimp, he's a wimp.

48:46.365 --> 48:49.573
Hey, come on, you guys.
Give him a chance, come back!

48:49.657 --> 48:50.865
Is this a joke?

48:50.949 --> 48:52.365
You're missing
"The Donahue Show."

48:52.448 --> 48:54.699
I had you on
"The Donahue Show," booked!

48:54.782 --> 48:57.240
Chuck? You've gotta tell 'em.

48:57.323 --> 48:59.532
Now, just tell 'em
like you told me.

48:59.615 --> 49:01.990
[women talking indistinctly]

49:04.281 --> 49:05.740
How would you ladies
like to earn

49:05.824 --> 49:08.198
ten times the amount of
money you earn now?

49:10.615 --> 49:12.448
I'm not kidding.

49:12.532 --> 49:15.073
Ten times the amount of money
that you earn right now.

49:17.699 --> 49:19.699
You wanna use the blackboard?

49:22.699 --> 49:25.156
You know, you're
absolutely right.

49:25.240 --> 49:26.865
We're not pimps.

49:29.990 --> 49:32.281
I-if I understand it
correctly, pimps make..

49:32.365 --> 49:35.949
...70, 80, 90 percent
of your money, right?

49:36.031 --> 49:37.448
(all women)
Yeah.

49:37.532 --> 49:39.115
You work very hard
for that money, don't you?

49:39.198 --> 49:40.490
(all women)
Yeah!

49:40.573 --> 49:42.448
Then please think
of William and myself

49:42.532 --> 49:46.281
as, uh, "business managers,"
okay? As-as agents, if you will.

49:46.365 --> 49:49.782
We're only interested in
ten percent of your money.

49:49.865 --> 49:51.615
- Ten percent?
- Leave him alone.

49:51.699 --> 49:54.115
He's doing fine.

49:55.615 --> 49:57.615
And, ladies, I have a knack.

49:57.699 --> 50:00.323
I can take money and I can
make it into more money.

50:00.407 --> 50:02.115
(female #4)
'Oh, boy!'

50:02.198 --> 50:05.657
Why shouldn't you have
the fruits of your labor?

50:05.740 --> 50:07.865
Why should you be
cheated and beaten?

50:07.949 --> 50:09.448
- That's right.
- Yeah.

50:09.532 --> 50:13.281
Do you have a dental plan?
A health plan?

50:13.365 --> 50:16.657
Well, if you come with us,
we'd give you a sound foundation

50:16.740 --> 50:18.448
a financial foundation.

50:18.532 --> 50:19.824
And-and if you
don't come with us

50:19.907 --> 50:21.198
well, then
I-I totally understand it

50:21.281 --> 50:23.532
and I say thank you
very much for listening.

50:23.615 --> 50:26.490
- Where are you going?
- Wait. Hey.

50:26.573 --> 50:28.490
That was great.

50:28.573 --> 50:29.824
What do you think?
What do you think?

50:29.907 --> 50:32.532
- You think this guy is legit?
- Yeah!

50:32.615 --> 50:34.281
He's legit.
That's right.

50:34.365 --> 50:36.198
Come on, man, wait a minute.
These guys are snowing us.

50:36.281 --> 50:37.740
And you know that.
This is too easy.

50:37.824 --> 50:40.240
- Aw!
- No!

50:40.323 --> 50:42.198
You should have pushed
a little more.

50:42.281 --> 50:45.240
- You should have just pushed.
- I did the best I could.

50:45.323 --> 50:46.699
Okay, are we going to do this?

50:46.782 --> 50:48.490
(all)
Yeah!

50:50.323 --> 50:51.907
We're all yours, Chuck.

50:51.990 --> 50:53.365
You pushed just enough,
you know.

50:53.448 --> 50:55.990
You.. Right up to it,
then you laid back.

50:57.990 --> 50:59.448
Hey, I'm third!

51:01.782 --> 51:04.865
What if we get to have
them all too, sexually?

51:04.949 --> 51:06.865
♪ That kind of love ♪

Yes, he did.

No, he's,
he's a strange guy.

He, you know,
he's not like you and me.

I'll come back later, bring
him a bottle, get him drunk.

01:17:32.699 --> 01:17:34.115
Take off his clothes.

01:17:34.198 --> 01:17:36.323

01:27:21.490 --> 01:27:23.448
You know what I mean.

01:27:31.323 --> 01:27:33.073
Is this gonna take
long or what?

01:27:33.156 --> 01:27:35.448
I have a tennis club lesson
at one o'clock.

01:27:35.532 --> 01:27:37.907
I already missed one
when...we were in prison.

01:27:37.990 --> 01:27:40.448
I see.
Can I get you anything?

01:27:40.532 --> 01:27:43.573
Yeah, alright.
Uh, lamb chops--

01:27:43.657 --> 01:27:46.115
I was thinking more in terms
of something to drink.

01:27:46.198 --> 01:27:49.156
Why don't we just get started?

01:27:57.490 --> 01:28:00.073
Mr. Droll Hauser

01:28:00.156 --> 01:28:01.740
are we going to prison?

01:28:01.824 --> 01:28:03.407
Yeah, that's a good question.

01:28:03.490 --> 01:28:06.031
I hardly think so.

01:28:06.115 --> 01:28:08.281
You see, boys,
this is an election year.

01:28:08.365 --> 01:28:10.657
And the party in power..

01:28:10.740 --> 01:28:12.281
...well, let's just say

01:28:12.365 --> 01:28:15.740
they find the whole situation
rather embarrassing.

01:28:15.824 --> 01:28:17.949
'Therefore, it would be
in the best interest'

01:28:18.031 --> 01:28:22.115
of all concerned if they just
gave you boys your jobs back

01:28:22.198 --> 01:28:24.657
and forgot the whole thing.

01:28:24.740 --> 01:28:28.281
I assume that's okay with you.

01:28:28.365 --> 01:28:29.865
Okay?

01:28:31.699 --> 01:28:33.156
Okay?

01:28:34.699 --> 01:28:36.990
Mr. Droll Hauser.

01:28:37.073 --> 01:28:39.657
That's the greatest thing
I ever heard.

01:28:39.740 --> 01:28:42.615
Thank you very much.
That's fantastic.

01:28:42.699 --> 01:28:45.490
Well, it's not okay
with me. Ha ha ha.

01:28:45.573 --> 01:28:47.365
We got them over the barrel.

01:28:48.699 --> 01:28:51.490
As long as we do..

01:28:51.573 --> 01:28:53.532
...I say we get
something out of it.

01:28:55.699 --> 01:28:58.073
Can I talk to him alone, please?

01:29:04.782 --> 01:29:07.240
[whistling]

01:29:16.031 --> 01:29:21.115
I have thought about this
for the entire time in jail.

01:29:21.198 --> 01:29:25.532
And what I want is to go back
to my old life..

01:29:25.615 --> 01:29:27.198
...the way it was
before this craziness.

01:29:27.281 --> 01:29:31.407
I want my old life back.

01:29:31.490 --> 01:29:33.699
Please, Bill.

01:29:33.782 --> 01:29:36.490
Please let me have
my old life back.

01:29:39.740 --> 01:29:41.865
No.

01:29:41.949 --> 01:29:44.031
Chuck, if I did that

01:29:44.115 --> 01:29:46.532
I'd never be able to sleep
with myself again.

01:29:46.615 --> 01:29:48.865
We're holding the cards.

01:29:48.949 --> 01:29:51.156
They're afraid of us.

01:29:51.240 --> 01:29:53.990
You see the beauty here?

01:29:54.073 --> 01:29:56.407
I say, we go down there
right now, alright?

01:29:56.490 --> 01:29:57.907
And we march right
into the mayor's office

01:29:57.990 --> 01:29:59.573
we lay it on the line.
You want to?

01:29:59.657 --> 01:30:01.031
Come on. It will be fun.
It'd be great.

01:30:01.115 --> 01:30:02.448
[grunting]

01:30:03.407 --> 01:30:04.865
What are you doing?

01:30:04.949 --> 01:30:06.323
Chuck, what are you..

01:30:06.407 --> 01:30:08.323
Chuck, I'm wearing white.

01:30:09.156 --> 01:30:11.115
[grunting]

01:30:12.407 --> 01:30:15.198
You're crazy!
Get away, Chuck!

01:30:15.281 --> 01:30:17.407
Get away from the door, you!

01:30:17.490 --> 01:30:19.907
Oh, you're not going
to see the mayor.

01:30:19.990 --> 01:30:23.740
You're not gonna make any
demands or I'm gonna kill you.

01:30:23.824 --> 01:30:26.490
You're gonna play
tennis...with God.

01:30:28.156 --> 01:30:29.699
Now..

01:30:29.782 --> 01:30:31.865
...are you going
to change your mind?

01:30:33.365 --> 01:30:34.782
No.

01:30:34.865 --> 01:30:36.448
[shattering]

01:30:36.532 --> 01:30:39.740
Are you going
to change your mind?

01:30:39.824 --> 01:30:41.448
Chuck, you gotta
keep that elbow stiff.

01:30:41.532 --> 01:30:43.281
[grunts]

01:30:43.365 --> 01:30:44.782
[glass shattering]

01:30:44.865 --> 01:30:46.281
- What's going on in there?
- I don't know.

01:30:46.365 --> 01:30:49.031
[grunting]

01:30:49.115 --> 01:30:52.240
My...God.

01:30:52.323 --> 01:30:54.573
[indistinct screaming]

01:30:54.657 --> 01:30:57.448
I could have you guys
executed for this!

01:30:57.532 --> 01:31:00.156
[all screaming]

01:31:00.240 --> 01:31:01.615
Call maintenance!

01:31:01.699 --> 01:31:03.073
Get them up here!

01:31:05.699 --> 01:31:07.281
You'll be hearing
from my lawyer.

01:31:07.365 --> 01:31:09.573
Oh, are you okay, Mr. Chuckie?

01:31:09.657 --> 01:31:12.281
- I'm calm. I'm calm.
- Are you calm?

01:31:12.365 --> 01:31:17.198
- Are you bleeding?
- It's okay, girls. Let go.

01:31:22.365 --> 01:31:24.699
[screaming]

01:31:28.031 --> 01:31:29.073
I'll tell you something.

01:31:29.156 --> 01:31:31.281
You listen to me, Mr. Idea man.

01:31:31.365 --> 01:31:33.115
I will go back to the morgue

01:31:33.198 --> 01:31:35.115
and I will put my life straight

01:31:35.198 --> 01:31:36.824
the life that you ruined.

01:31:36.907 --> 01:31:39.699
Everything that's bad
that happened to me...you did.

01:31:39.782 --> 01:31:41.657
'I don't want to
see you anymore.'

01:31:41.740 --> 01:31:43.824
I don't want to hear
from you anymore.

01:31:43.907 --> 01:31:46.281
I don't even want to hear
rumors about you anymore.

01:31:46.365 --> 01:31:47.949
Here's a good idea

01:31:48.031 --> 01:31:49.156
Why don't you get a ticket
on the first space shuttle

01:31:49.240 --> 01:31:51.323
and get out of here.

01:31:51.407 --> 01:31:53.240
Excuse me.

01:32:03.073 --> 01:32:04.198
Hello.

01:32:05.865 --> 01:32:08.490
Hi.

01:32:08.573 --> 01:32:10.156
[instrumental music]

01:32:10.240 --> 01:32:12.532
- How are you?
- Okay.

01:32:14.573 --> 01:32:16.156
Well, what have
you been doing?

01:32:16.240 --> 01:32:18.407
You mean since jail?

01:32:18.490 --> 01:32:20.573
I'm back to work.

01:32:20.657 --> 01:32:22.323
Yeah, me, too.

01:32:22.407 --> 01:32:24.532
I start a new job tonight.

01:32:24.615 --> 01:32:26.323
Really? What are you doing?

01:32:26.407 --> 01:32:29.573
Uh...I'm doing the same
thing I did before.

01:32:29.657 --> 01:32:32.031
I'm just doing it
in a different place.

01:32:32.115 --> 01:32:34.198
Paradise found, just off 6th.

01:32:34.281 --> 01:32:35.907
- I've heard of it.
- Yeah.

01:32:35.990 --> 01:32:39.156
It's supposed
to be real nice, you know.

01:32:39.990 --> 01:32:41.156
So.

01:32:42.281 --> 01:32:44.031
Look, I may not see you again.

01:32:44.115 --> 01:32:46.031
I'm moving on Friday.

01:32:46.115 --> 01:32:47.281
Oh?

01:32:48.490 --> 01:32:49.990
Condo.

01:32:51.115 --> 01:32:52.990
Very good investment.

01:32:55.907 --> 01:32:57.573
Yeah.

01:32:57.657 --> 01:33:00.615
[instrumental music]

01:33:05.657 --> 01:33:08.615
Well, I guess you don't want
to be late for your first day.

01:33:09.949 --> 01:33:11.156
No.

01:33:13.115 --> 01:33:14.323
Bye.

01:33:15.699 --> 01:33:17.156
Bye.

01:33:19.281 --> 01:33:22.156
[instrumental music]

01:33:36.281 --> 01:33:39.073
- Where the fuck is 4K?
- What?

01:33:39.156 --> 01:33:42.156
Excuse me, I didn't
know you was deaf.

01:33:42.240 --> 01:33:44.490
4K!

01:33:44.573 --> 01:33:46.407
I'm 4k. Is that my dinner?

01:33:46.490 --> 01:33:48.824
You do with it what you want.

01:33:48.907 --> 01:33:52.281
It's 5 bucks.
I already added in my tip.

01:33:52.365 --> 01:33:54.198
How thoughtful.

01:33:56.365 --> 01:33:58.198
Thank you.

01:34:02.532 --> 01:34:04.073
Excuse me.

01:34:04.156 --> 01:34:05.782
There's mustard
on this sandwich.

01:34:05.865 --> 01:34:06.990
So?

01:34:07.073 --> 01:34:08.949
So, it's egg salad.

01:34:09.031 --> 01:34:10.907
Give me the sandwich.

01:34:19.657 --> 01:34:21.198
Happy now?

01:34:24.073 --> 01:34:26.949
I would like
a whole new sandwich.

01:34:30.198 --> 01:34:32.198
Listen to me.

01:34:37.115 --> 01:34:40.281
[elevator door buzzing]

01:34:40.365 --> 01:34:41.532
- You listen to me!
- Take it easy.

01:34:41.615 --> 01:34:42.615
You listen to me!

01:34:42.699 --> 01:34:43.782
I'll never again

01:34:43.865 --> 01:34:46.198
eat a sandwich I didn't order.

01:34:46.281 --> 01:34:49.615
I am sick and tired
of being afraid.

01:34:49.699 --> 01:34:51.156
Bad jobs, bad sandwiches

01:34:51.240 --> 01:34:52.323
neurotic girlfriends

01:34:52.407 --> 01:34:53.490
no longer for this man.

01:34:53.573 --> 01:34:54.657
Do you understand?

01:34:54.740 --> 01:34:56.240
[growling]

01:34:57.281 --> 01:34:58.281
You!

01:34:59.532 --> 01:35:00.782
Go home!

01:35:00.865 --> 01:35:02.532
[whimpers]

01:35:03.907 --> 01:35:07.156
And you, go clean off my door.

01:35:07.240 --> 01:35:10.115
[instrumental music]

01:35:16.990 --> 01:35:18.949
[car horns honk]

01:35:32.949 --> 01:35:34.532
Excuse me.

01:35:34.615 --> 01:35:36.490
Do you know that I joined
this club one month ago?

01:35:36.573 --> 01:35:37.990
I have not received
my membership cards.

01:35:38.073 --> 01:35:39.240
- Where is the manager?
- I don't know.

01:35:39.323 --> 01:35:40.573
Could you please
call the manager?

01:35:40.657 --> 01:35:41.990
You know what,
I'll find him myself.

01:35:42.073 --> 01:35:43.407
Hey, sir.

01:35:48.824 --> 01:35:51.198
[song continues]

01:36:00.156 --> 01:36:02.907
Is everything alright,
Mr. Tuttle?

01:36:02.990 --> 01:36:05.073
Where's the god damn towel boy?

01:36:05.156 --> 01:36:07.407
I'm not coming out
of this pool naked!

01:36:07.490 --> 01:36:09.073
Not with these parrots
around here.

01:36:09.156 --> 01:36:10.990
Of course, Mr. Tuttle.

01:36:11.990 --> 01:36:14.448
Yo, towel boy!

01:36:18.323 --> 01:36:20.573
Oh, sorry.

01:36:20.657 --> 01:36:23.365
Hi, Mr. Manetti. Hey, nice
threads. Very Miami beach.

01:36:23.448 --> 01:36:26.115
Yeah?
Mr. Tuttle would like a towel.

01:36:26.198 --> 01:36:27.407
Alright. Yes, sir.

01:36:27.490 --> 01:36:29.281
Here you go.
Hey, Mr. Tuttle.

01:36:29.365 --> 01:36:31.573
How are you doing?
How's everything?

01:36:31.657 --> 01:36:34.740
There you are, sir. Got one.

01:36:34.824 --> 01:36:36.615
Maybe you ought to
take two, Mr. Tuttle.

01:36:36.699 --> 01:36:39.073
I don't think one will do it.

01:36:39.156 --> 01:36:40.115
The less seen, the better, huh?

01:36:40.198 --> 01:36:42.990
[chuckles]

01:36:43.073 --> 01:36:46.115
Excuse me, Mr. Tuttle.
Ha ha ha.

01:36:46.198 --> 01:36:47.490
Belinda?

01:36:47.573 --> 01:36:49.407
Do you know Belinda Keaton?

01:36:49.490 --> 01:36:51.281
No, I don't.

01:36:51.365 --> 01:36:52.448
Now, listen, helium head.

01:36:52.532 --> 01:36:54.115
How hard is it
to distribute towels?

01:36:54.198 --> 01:36:55.824
Well, it's a skill
like anything else.

01:36:55.907 --> 01:36:58.573
These people pay $8,000
a year just to join this club.

01:36:58.657 --> 01:37:00.115
They expect some service.

01:37:00.198 --> 01:37:01.407
Stop screwing around, or I'll
put your ass out of here.

01:37:01.490 --> 01:37:02.615
- You understand?
- yes, sir.

01:37:02.699 --> 01:37:04.448
- Beat it!
- Alright. Jack off.

01:37:04.532 --> 01:37:06.073
- What was that?
- Nothing. It wasn't me.

01:37:06.156 --> 01:37:09.699
It was the birds-birds.
I guess the birds...birds.

01:37:13.615 --> 01:37:14.615
What are you doing here?

01:37:14.699 --> 01:37:15.782
What are you doing here?

01:37:15.865 --> 01:37:16.990
I'm looking for Belinda.

01:37:17.073 --> 01:37:18.990
Is she working here?

01:37:19.073 --> 01:37:20.448
Excuse me.

01:37:21.115 --> 01:37:22.699
Hey, hey.

01:37:22.782 --> 01:37:24.782
Hey, don't go for thinking I
work here, man, 'cause I don't.

01:37:24.865 --> 01:37:26.699
I own this place.
I bought it this morning.

01:37:26.782 --> 01:37:27.782
Hey, straighten that strap.

01:37:27.865 --> 01:37:28.824
Drop dead.

01:37:28.907 --> 01:37:30.490
Oh, you're fired, alright?

01:37:30.573 --> 01:37:32.782
Clean out your locker. You're
in the archives. You're history.

01:37:32.865 --> 01:37:34.156
Hey, Chuck, don't bump
or get in trouble, man.

01:37:34.240 --> 01:37:36.490
Why? With who?
You own the place.

01:37:36.573 --> 01:37:37.949
I know, but I got partners.
