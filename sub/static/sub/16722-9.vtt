Why are you putting up
ninja throwing stars?

00:32.142 --> 00:33.426
I think they're doilies.

00:33.460 --> 00:34.761
They're snowflakes!

00:34.795 --> 00:35.928
They're Christmas-y.

00:35.963 --> 00:37.196
Ninja snowflakes!

00:37.231 --> 00:39.415
Hi-yah! Ha! Yah!
Ow. Ow. Gene.

00:39.450 --> 00:42.769
Speaking of Christmas, here's
my annual list of demands.

00:42.803 --> 00:44.203
"My own apartment."

00:44.238 --> 00:45.972
And it cannot be a studio.

00:46.006 --> 00:48.641
You have exactly
seven shopping days to comply.

00:48.676 --> 00:50.643
If it rolls into day eight,

00:50.678 --> 00:52.945
there will be tears and violence.

00:52.980 --> 00:54.580
I want a dry erase board.

00:54.615 --> 00:56.248
So I can write down
all my private thoughts

00:56.266 --> 00:58.067
and then erase them immediately.

00:58.102 --> 01:01.420
I want the actual Olympic
bobsled used in <i>Cool Runnings.</i>

01:01.438 --> 01:03.756
We can't afford
any of those things, kids.

01:03.791 --> 01:05.224
Not even a dry erase board?

01:05.259 --> 01:06.426
No, Tina!

01:06.460 --> 01:08.127
Sorry. Been a tough year,

01:08.162 --> 01:10.596
ever since the City Guide
listed us as a gas station.

01:10.631 --> 01:12.965
Hey, a bunch of presents don't matter.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.801
Christmas isn't all about getting stuff.

01:14.835 --> 01:15.802
Yes, it is!

01:15.836 --> 01:17.437
Take it back!
Take it back!

01:19.173 --> 01:21.474
Merry Christmas, Mike!

01:21.508 --> 01:22.809
Ho, ho, ho!

01:22.843 --> 01:23.976
Merry Christmas to you.

01:24.011 --> 01:25.178
Hi, Mike.
Hi, Bob.

01:25.212 --> 01:26.229
Here's your mail.

01:26.263 --> 01:27.296
Thanks.

01:27.331 --> 01:28.431
Ahem.

01:28.465 --> 01:29.465
What?

01:29.500 --> 01:30.666
Ahem!

01:30.701 --> 01:32.268
Oh. Right.
Of course.

01:32.302 --> 01:34.670
You know, I never know
how much to tip the mailman.

01:34.705 --> 01:35.972
No, you don't.

01:36.006 --> 01:37.573
Um, you know what, here.

01:37.608 --> 01:41.577
Uh, I am going to write
a number on this piece of paper.

01:41.612 --> 01:43.146
There you go.

01:43.180 --> 01:44.480
Oh, yeah, that's about right...

01:44.515 --> 01:46.315
if I delivered mail one day a week.

01:46.350 --> 01:48.851
Fine.
Here's more than that.

01:48.886 --> 01:50.286
Oh, thanks, Bob.

01:50.320 --> 01:52.255
Hey, I got something
special for you, too.

01:52.289 --> 01:53.823
Special delivery.

01:53.857 --> 01:55.925
Were you not gonna give me this
if I didn't tip you?

01:55.959 --> 01:58.161
No, I-I would have.
Just not today.

01:58.195 --> 01:59.929
Maybe it's from Santa.

01:59.963 --> 02:02.448
It's from the law firm of
Bankoff, Bostwick & Biel.

02:02.483 --> 02:04.350
Santa's suing us!

02:04.384 --> 02:06.152
Hey, it says I've been named an heir

02:06.186 --> 02:08.187
in the enclosed will
of Ernest G. Lombard.

02:08.222 --> 02:10.122
Aw! Uncle Ernie's dead?

02:10.157 --> 02:11.691
But it's Christmas.

02:11.725 --> 02:13.893
Huh, I haven't talked
to Uncle Ernie in years.

02:13.927 --> 02:16.801
"Talking to Uncle Ernie" would
be great code for going a poop.

02:16.921 --> 02:18.174
James, he just died.

02:18.294 --> 02:19.530
It's a fitting tribute.

02:19.650 --> 02:22.029
Excuse me, who is *** this guy?

02:22.149 --> 02:23.550
He was my mother's brother.

02:23.584 --> 02:25.118
He owned Lombard's Department Store

02:25.153 --> 02:27.054
before the mall came
and put it out of business.

02:27.088 --> 02:28.722
How much did Uncle Ernie leave you?

02:28.756 --> 02:30.223
Well, let's see what
it say... Hey! Hey!

02:30.258 --> 02:31.391
A-ba-ba-ba!
Don't look!

02:31.426 --> 02:32.926
Let's have a reading of the will.

02:32.961 --> 02:33.961
I'll make punch.

02:33.995 --> 02:35.462
You always want to make punch.

02:35.496 --> 02:36.897
Ever heard of eggnog?

02:36.931 --> 02:38.765
I have all those sample punch packets.

02:38.800 --> 02:40.600
Ah, look, I got...
just got another one.

02:40.635 --> 02:43.103
I'm so excited! I have to go
talk to Uncle Ernie!

02:44.539 --> 02:48.141
Okay, everyone has their punch,

02:48.176 --> 02:50.410
so it's time to inherit the wind!

02:50.445 --> 02:51.812
Oh, mmm. Ooh,
it's good.

02:51.846 --> 02:52.813
No, it's not.

02:52.847 --> 02:54.281
Let's make a pact

02:54.315 --> 02:55.682
that we won't let the money change us.

02:55.717 --> 02:57.117
Uncle Ernie's worst Christmas

02:57.151 --> 02:59.269
is going to be our best Christmas!

02:59.303 --> 03:00.937
Okay, let's not get ahead of ourselves.

03:00.972 --> 03:02.105
Jamaican bobsled!
Apartment!

03:02.139 --> 03:03.090
Dry erase board.

03:03.124 --> 03:04.958
Uh, like that.

03:04.993 --> 03:07.094
Let's just say this Christmas
might not be terrible.

03:07.128 --> 03:08.795
Ahem!

03:08.830 --> 03:09.796
You have been bequeathed...

03:09.831 --> 03:10.797
Drumroll!

03:12.667 --> 03:16.436
...storage unit 39 at
the Quincy Avenue Just-Stow-It.

03:16.471 --> 03:18.005
Oh.
Ugh.

03:19.907 --> 03:22.542
I still have a good feeling about this.

03:22.577 --> 03:24.444
There could be an old car in there.

03:24.479 --> 03:26.446
Or a whole bunch
of fur coats. Ooh.

03:26.481 --> 03:28.181
I'm gonna throw paint on them!

03:28.216 --> 03:29.983
Remember, if it's something really good,

03:30.018 --> 03:32.636
we'll have to pay taxes on it.

03:32.670 --> 03:34.504
Huh?

03:35.506 --> 03:37.040
Oh, hey.

03:37.075 --> 03:38.341
We won a caveman!

03:40.797 --> 03:41.764
Who are you?

03:41.798 --> 03:43.082
My name's Chet.

03:43.116 --> 03:44.783
Uh, short for Chester, long for Ch.

03:44.818 --> 03:46.185
That's my little joke.

03:46.219 --> 03:47.586
Did you, did you enjoy the joke?

03:47.621 --> 03:48.988
Yes.
Eh.

03:49.022 --> 03:51.423
I'm Tina. Shoes on or off?

03:51.458 --> 03:53.359
On, please. Can I get
you something to drink?

03:53.393 --> 03:54.593
Cough syrup?
Rainwater?

03:54.628 --> 03:55.794
Not that.
That's urine.

03:55.829 --> 03:56.862
Why are you living

03:56.897 --> 03:58.097
in my uncle's storage unit?

03:58.131 --> 03:59.431
Mr. Lombard is your uncle?

03:59.466 --> 04:02.134
Yeah, he left me this unit in his will.

04:02.168 --> 04:03.936
Oh. Mr. Lombard's dead?

04:03.970 --> 04:05.037
Yeah.

04:05.071 --> 04:06.322
You want to come in for a hug?

04:06.356 --> 04:07.439
Um, no.

04:07.474 --> 04:08.624
Why? 'Cause
we just met?

04:08.658 --> 04:09.758
Yeah, I guess.

04:09.793 --> 04:10.759
That's better.

04:10.794 --> 04:12.361
May I join you two?
No.

04:12.395 --> 04:13.996
So, how'd you know Uncle Ernie?

04:14.030 --> 04:16.265
I did window displays at
his store for 20 years.

04:16.298 --> 04:18.534
When the store closed,
he let me stay in here.

04:18.567 --> 04:21.220
Don't you have a family
or friends to stay with?

04:21.254 --> 04:23.289
You know, with Christmas coming
and all that.

04:23.323 --> 04:24.823
Wait, it's Christmas?

04:24.858 --> 04:27.109
My calendar says it's,
uh, da-da-da... August.

04:27.143 --> 04:29.712
Bobby, tell him
he can stay in our basement.

04:29.746 --> 04:30.779
;
What? Why?

04:30.814 --> 04:32.314
Because, 'tis the season!

04:32.349 --> 04:34.783
Of what? Taking strange
men into our basement?

04:34.818 --> 04:36.385
Of being nice, Bobby.

04:36.419 --> 04:37.987
He's fine right here.

04:38.021 --> 04:39.622
He's got a TV and a jar.

04:39.656 --> 04:41.624
You guys are loud whisperers.
Sorry.

04:41.658 --> 04:42.958
So, you're taking over the lease?

04:42.993 --> 04:43.993
It's 150 a month.

04:44.027 --> 04:45.361
Oh.

04:45.395 --> 04:47.246
Thanks again for letting me stay here.

04:47.280 --> 04:49.048
Yeah, Bobby, you old softie.

04:49.082 --> 04:50.816
You're like a mushy snowman.

04:50.850 --> 04:52.351
A lot of space!

04:52.385 --> 04:53.752
I can't wait until the
carpeting comes in.

04:53.787 --> 04:55.354
Is your heart set on this wall color?

04:55.388 --> 04:56.855
'Cause I have some ideas.

04:56.890 --> 04:58.824
But just to be clear, Chet,
you're only here

04:58.858 --> 05:00.359
till right after Christmas.

05:00.393 --> 05:02.027
This Christmas?
Um, yeah.

05:02.062 --> 05:03.696
The one that's coming up in a week.

05:03.730 --> 05:06.231
This is the nicest thing
anybody's ever done for me.

05:06.266 --> 05:08.701
Including when Sal over there
gave me this track suit.

05:08.735 --> 05:10.703
If you want to give Sal something,

05:10.737 --> 05:12.805
he needs a penis.

05:15.275 --> 05:16.542
Fire!
What?!

05:16.576 --> 05:17.926
Just kidding. Come look.
What?

05:17.978 --> 05:19.361
Come on.
What? What happened?

05:20.397 --> 05:22.564
Ah!

05:22.599 --> 05:23.565
Chet's gone.

05:23.600 --> 05:25.267
His pee jar is cold.

05:25.302 --> 05:26.902
I got to say, I'm relieved.

05:26.936 --> 05:28.404
There was something off about that guy.

05:28.438 --> 05:29.905
And he smelled...

05:29.939 --> 05:31.106
Oh, oh! It's Chet!

05:31.141 --> 05:32.274
Oh. Hey, Chet.

05:32.309 --> 05:33.742
There's my guy.

05:33.777 --> 05:35.377
What do you think of the display?

05:35.412 --> 05:36.712
Is it holi-doing
it for you?

05:36.746 --> 05:38.013
You did all this?

05:38.048 --> 05:39.348
Oh, it's amazing!

05:39.382 --> 05:41.917
You gave me a place to stay, I give you:

05:41.951 --> 05:44.403
Class under Glass, by Chet.

05:44.421 --> 05:47.690
So you don't just design the
displays, you're also in them?

05:47.724 --> 05:49.391
Of course. Why
wouldn't I be?

05:49.426 --> 05:50.592
Well, it's a nice display.

05:50.627 --> 05:52.227
Um, thanks for doing it.

05:52.262 --> 05:53.862
How long did it take...?

05:53.897 --> 05:55.898
Chet? Chet?

05:55.932 --> 05:58.267
He's being weird again.

06:00.570 --> 06:03.272
It's been two hours
and he still hasn't moved.

06:03.306 --> 06:04.440
Come on!

06:04.474 --> 06:05.708
I'm tired of pantsing him.

06:05.742 --> 06:06.875
It's like pantsing a stone.

06:06.910 --> 06:07.876
Or Grandpa.

06:07.911 --> 06:09.311
I love your display.

06:09.346 --> 06:10.312
The hats are fabulous.

06:10.347 --> 06:11.313
How much are they?

06:11.348 --> 06:12.548
Uh, we don't sell hats.

06:12.582 --> 06:13.716
We sell burgers.

06:13.750 --> 06:15.084
We still need to find a hat

06:15.118 --> 06:16.385
and something for the mailman.

06:16.419 --> 06:18.620
Please tell me
you sell gift certificates.

06:18.655 --> 06:23.158
I, uh, I have a napkin
and a pen, so I can write one.

06:25.362 --> 06:26.962
You know, Chet may be a strange guy,

06:26.996 --> 06:28.747
but his display really
upped our foot traffic.

06:28.781 --> 06:30.399
Okay, Chet. We're closed.

06:30.433 --> 06:31.600
You can move now.

06:31.634 --> 06:33.168
Whew! Ah!

06:33.203 --> 06:34.820
I am full of lactic acid

06:34.854 --> 06:37.272
and ideas for tomorrow's window!

06:37.307 --> 06:39.608
Ah! You're gonna do
a different one tomorrow?

06:39.642 --> 06:41.827
Tomorrow and then the next day
and then the next day

06:41.861 --> 06:43.762
and then the next day
and then the next day

06:43.797 --> 06:44.997
and then it's Christmas, so I'll stop.

06:45.031 --> 06:46.532
Can we help?
I want to be a Gene-equin!

06:46.566 --> 06:47.866
I'll be a Tina-quin.

06:47.901 --> 06:49.701
Let me print up
some real gift certificates.

06:49.736 --> 06:52.037
And maybe, uh, cover the window
with a big curtain,

06:52.072 --> 06:54.173
and unveil the new display
right before we open.

06:54.207 --> 06:55.941
That's very theatrical.
Are you gay?

06:55.975 --> 06:57.309
We wish.

06:57.343 --> 06:58.977
<i>Okay.</i>

06:59.012 --> 07:01.380
Anything jumping out at you
for tomorrow's display?

07:01.414 --> 07:02.681
I found a train!

07:02.715 --> 07:04.716
The most civilized form of toy travel.

07:04.751 --> 07:06.518
This would look good
in my new apartment.

07:06.553 --> 07:09.021
It was a joke at first, but now
I'm starting to expect it.

07:09.055 --> 07:10.989
This is fun, teaming up, you know?

07:11.024 --> 07:13.225
I used to do windows
with my wife, Nadine.

07:13.259 --> 07:14.393
Oh, you're married?

07:14.427 --> 07:15.627
We're separated.

07:15.662 --> 07:17.729
It's okay. What's past is past.

07:17.764 --> 07:20.566
Let's just, uh, focus on
tomorrow's window.

07:20.600 --> 07:21.967
Moving on!

07:22.001 --> 07:23.335
Yeah, your new family doesn't want

07:23.369 --> 07:24.703
to hear about your old family.

07:53.566 --> 07:55.367
here in the window of Bob's Burgers,

07:55.401 --> 07:57.069
where you could say he's been making

07:57.103 --> 07:59.605
quite a living display of himself.

07:59.639 --> 08:01.173
Hey, look, I can see me!

08:01.207 --> 08:02.407
Look, I'm waving!

08:02.442 --> 08:03.876
Wow, this is great for us.

08:03.910 --> 08:04.910
We're on the news.
The restaurant...

08:04.944 --> 08:07.012
Gene, stop licking yourself.

08:07.046 --> 08:08.280
You're on TV.

08:08.314 --> 08:09.615
Where I belong!

08:09.649 --> 08:11.216
So, Bob, what's it gonna be

08:11.251 --> 08:13.285
for the big Christmas Eve finale?

08:13.319 --> 08:15.220
I don't know what
the last display's gonna be.

08:15.255 --> 08:16.522
Chet's the idea guy.

08:16.556 --> 08:17.589
Let's hear your idea, Chet.

08:17.624 --> 08:18.790
No, no, no! Don't tell me!

08:18.825 --> 08:20.125
Don't ruin it.

08:20.160 --> 08:21.460
No, you got to tell me, you...

08:21.494 --> 08:22.461
I can't handle it.

08:22.495 --> 08:23.695
No, no, no, no, no!

08:23.730 --> 08:25.063
Don't tell me. Don't tell me.

08:25.098 --> 08:26.415
Guy's fun to talk to.

08:26.449 --> 08:28.100
Whatever it is, it better be good.

08:28.134 --> 08:29.635
Mort's mom is coming to see it.

08:29.669 --> 08:32.104
She's got cataracts, so make it big.

08:32.138 --> 08:35.107
<i>It's not here yet, but</i>
<i>I want to go on record and say</i>

08:35.140 --> 08:36.909
this is the best
Christmas ever! Whoa!

08:36.943 --> 08:38.876
I know. We might actually
be able to afford

08:38.912 --> 08:40.629
to buy the kids something nice.

08:40.663 --> 08:42.764
And maybe I can sneak out
later while you cover for me.

08:42.799 --> 08:44.265
Yeah, I'll tell the kids

08:44.300 --> 08:45.984
you're dropping off
a present for your mistress.

08:46.019 --> 08:47.569
As if.

08:48.788 --> 08:50.122
Why are you wrapping the TV remote?

08:50.156 --> 08:51.823
It's my Christmas present to Dad.

08:51.858 --> 08:53.225
He loves this thing.

08:53.259 --> 08:54.209
Great idea.

08:54.244 --> 08:55.544
I'll wrap Mom's glasses.

08:55.578 --> 08:57.246
Hey, what you looking at, Chet?

08:57.280 --> 08:58.714
I'm just zoning out.

08:58.748 --> 09:00.465
This was Nadine's
favorite Christmas song.

09:00.500 --> 09:01.466
Oh, who's Nadine?

09:01.501 --> 09:03.101
♪ Silent night

09:03.136 --> 09:04.102
Oh.

09:04.137 --> 09:08.774
♪ Holy night...

09:08.808 --> 09:10.275
Who's Nadine?

09:10.310 --> 09:11.843
She's Chet's ex-wife.

09:11.878 --> 09:13.579
He's missing her pretty bad.

09:13.613 --> 09:15.080
How could you not miss her?

09:15.114 --> 09:17.149
Oh, she's gorgeous!

09:17.183 --> 09:19.318
Wait, is she...?

09:19.352 --> 09:20.586
Whoo.

09:20.620 --> 09:22.454
She looks nice.

09:22.488 --> 09:24.156
Yeah, perfect posture.

09:24.190 --> 09:26.024
And wooden boobs.

09:26.059 --> 09:28.227
Chet, this is a mannequin.

09:30.129 --> 09:34.116
Back when Nadine and I got
married, I was a mannequin, too.

09:34.150 --> 09:36.451
Oh, now I understand.

09:36.486 --> 09:38.453
You think you were a mannequin?

09:38.488 --> 09:40.455
Oh, it's okay. You don't need
to be scared of me.

09:40.490 --> 09:41.957
I'm not one of those murder mannequins

09:41.991 --> 09:43.525
or satanic mannequins.

09:43.576 --> 09:45.193
I'm just a store mannequin
that came to life.

09:45.245 --> 09:49.648
So happy you're staying with us
in our basement.

09:49.682 --> 09:52.684
♪ Sleep in
heavenly... ♪

09:52.719 --> 09:53.719
Okay, everybody out.

09:58.942 --> 10:00.108
Chet's crazy, Lin.

10:00.159 --> 10:02.463
Do you think he'll kill us
before or after Christmas?

10:02.583 --> 10:03.746
I don't think he will.

10:03.781 --> 10:05.214
He said he's not a murder mannequin.

10:05.249 --> 10:07.250
You two really have to work on
your whispering.

10:07.284 --> 10:09.752
So, if you're a mannequin,
you won't feel this!

10:09.770 --> 10:11.204
That hurt!

10:11.238 --> 10:12.722
I didn't say I <i>am</i> a mannequin.

10:12.756 --> 10:14.040
I said I <i>was</i> a mannequin.

10:14.074 --> 10:15.041
I get it.

10:15.075 --> 10:16.109
One day, all of a sudden,

10:16.143 --> 10:17.110
you're anatomically correct.

10:17.144 --> 10:18.278
I just went through that.

10:18.312 --> 10:19.812
Well, I'm pretty sure mannequins

10:19.847 --> 10:21.748
don't turn into people,
except in that one movie.

10:21.782 --> 10:22.882
This was no movie.

10:22.917 --> 10:24.567
This was retail.

10:24.601 --> 10:26.736
<i>The new summer sportswear</i>
<i>had just come in,</i>

10:26.770 --> 10:28.388
<i>and so had Nadine.</i>

10:28.422 --> 10:30.423
<i>She didn't have nipples, and, brother,</i>

10:30.457 --> 10:31.958
<i>she didn't need them.</i>

10:31.992 --> 10:33.993
<i>As summer turned to fall casuals,</i>

10:34.044 --> 10:35.828
<i>our relationship became anything but.</i>

10:35.863 --> 10:36.896
<i>Casual?</i>

10:36.931 --> 10:38.331
<i>Yes, casual.</i>

10:38.382 --> 10:40.767
<i>That winter, I took Nadine skiing.</i>

10:40.801 --> 10:42.302
<i>There was a terrible accident.</i>

10:42.336 --> 10:43.569
<i>Nadine shattered her right hand.</i>

10:43.604 --> 10:44.971
<i>Oh, God.</i>

10:45.005 --> 10:46.839
<i>When she came back to the store</i>

10:46.890 --> 10:49.092
<i>with two left hands, I knew</i>
<i>I had to make a decision.</i>

10:49.126 --> 10:50.793
<i>Which hand to replace with a hook?</i>

10:50.811 --> 10:52.412
<i>No.Which one</i>
<i>to put the ring on.</i>

10:52.446 --> 10:53.446
<i>Boo.</i>

10:53.480 --> 10:55.014
Oh, God, Lin, are you crying?

10:56.317 --> 10:58.117
You know I love weddings.

10:58.152 --> 11:00.853
We were going to be
together forever. Then came...

11:00.888 --> 11:02.989
<i>- the mall.</i>
<i>- Damn that mall!</i>

11:03.023 --> 11:04.857
<i>Lombard's had an
everything-must-go sale,</i>

11:04.892 --> 11:06.659
<i>and my everything went.</i>

11:06.694 --> 11:08.494
<i>I never saw her again.</i>

11:08.529 --> 11:10.346
Wait, why didn't she need nipples?

11:10.381 --> 11:12.448
I was so heartbroken.

11:12.483 --> 11:14.650
<i>The pain must have turned me human,</i>

11:14.668 --> 11:16.703
<i>so I could feel pain.</i>

11:19.322 --> 11:22.191
This is the greatest
love story ever told.

11:22.226 --> 11:24.994
Look, Chet, there's no way
any of that could be true.

11:25.029 --> 11:26.562
Well then, if I wasn't a mannequin,

11:26.597 --> 11:28.631
how come I don't know
how to use a computer?

11:28.666 --> 11:29.866
Explain that, Bob.

11:29.900 --> 11:31.184
Yeah, Dad, explain that.

11:31.218 --> 11:32.885
Don't give up, Chet.

11:32.920 --> 11:35.688
Maybe Nadine's still out there.
You could find her.

11:35.723 --> 11:37.156
Hmm.
Well, with a face like that,

11:37.191 --> 11:41.060
I assume she's modeling
in Paris or Milan.

11:41.095 --> 11:44.530
We could help, even if it means
going to Paris or Milan.

11:44.565 --> 11:46.299
Right.
I bet she's in Kosovo.

11:46.333 --> 11:47.684
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:47.718 --> 11:49.419
No one's helping Chet
look for a mannequin

11:49.453 --> 11:50.820
who may or may not exist.

11:50.854 --> 11:52.755
She existed!
Fine, she existed.

11:52.790 --> 11:54.490
And you were in love with her.

11:54.525 --> 11:55.925
But you were never a mannequin, Chet.

11:55.959 --> 11:57.326
Just move on.

11:57.361 --> 11:58.728
Nadine is probably in a dump somewhere.

12:00.014 --> 12:01.314
Oh, God!

12:01.348 --> 12:03.416
Kids, bed... now.

12:03.450 --> 12:05.651
I want to talk to your father.

12:05.686 --> 12:07.987
No, kids, stay.
Please stay.

12:08.022 --> 12:09.539
Go. Go!
Stay. Stay!

12:09.573 --> 12:11.207
You go!
Gene, stay!

12:11.225 --> 12:12.708
Now!
Tina, don't move!

12:12.726 --> 12:14.160
You go!
Louise, stay!

12:14.194 --> 12:16.112
Get out of here!
Don't leave me!

12:16.146 --> 12:18.748
You get out of here!

12:18.782 --> 12:21.284
How could you say that
in front of that poor Chet?

12:21.318 --> 12:24.203
Poor Chet?
Poor us, stuck with poor Chet.

12:24.238 --> 12:25.621
Bobby, you made him cry.

12:25.656 --> 12:27.023
He's unstable, Lin.

12:27.057 --> 12:28.725
I'm sure lots of things make him cry.

12:28.759 --> 12:30.259
Oh, I'm so mad I could stomp,

12:30.294 --> 12:31.527
Do it, Mom!

12:31.562 --> 12:32.895
Do the stompy dance!

12:32.930 --> 12:34.297
She's doing it!

12:34.331 --> 12:36.466
Don't bother bringing
the mistletoe to bed!

12:36.500 --> 12:38.101
But do bring me a snack.

12:38.135 --> 12:39.402
Chocolate!

12:42.740 --> 12:44.107
Mom, Dad, get up.

12:44.141 --> 12:45.441
What?
What happened?

12:45.476 --> 12:47.143
You have to see Chet's window.

12:50.914 --> 12:52.465
Oh!

12:52.516 --> 12:53.750
Oh, my God.

12:53.784 --> 12:55.384
What the hell is it?

12:55.419 --> 12:56.786
- He's gone murder-mannequin.
- No.

12:56.820 --> 12:59.372
It's the display window of my soul, Bob.

12:59.406 --> 13:00.807
This is a warning.

13:00.841 --> 13:04.310
Don't love or believe
or hope in anything.

13:04.344 --> 13:05.578
Message received.

13:05.612 --> 13:06.829
I like this area.

13:06.864 --> 13:08.081
Dig deeper.

13:08.115 --> 13:09.332
People are coming to see this.

13:09.366 --> 13:10.833
Our window was on TV

13:10.868 --> 13:12.735
and in the newspaper's
Christmas Countdown.

13:12.770 --> 13:14.837
You have to change it.
Make it happy.

13:14.872 --> 13:18.057
My happy is gone!
It's in the dump somewhere.

13:18.092 --> 13:19.959
I hope your face can catch, Bob,

13:19.993 --> 13:22.328
because I'm throwing
your words back in it.

13:22.362 --> 13:25.064
Nice job, Bobby.
Way to go.

13:25.099 --> 13:26.415
We have to find Nadine.

13:26.449 --> 13:27.633
Don't worry.

13:27.668 --> 13:29.902
Gene-equin knows
how a mannequin thinks.

13:29.937 --> 13:32.772
Ah, a traditional
Christmas mannequin hunt.

13:46.303 --> 13:48.087
Show us the window!

13:48.122 --> 13:50.256
Yeah!
Show us the window!

13:50.290 --> 13:51.457
Now!

13:51.492 --> 13:53.126
We found Nadine!

13:53.160 --> 13:54.427
We found her!

13:54.461 --> 13:56.796
Oh, it's a Christmas miracle.

13:56.830 --> 14:00.032
I told you kids not to go
looking for her... I mean, it.

14:00.067 --> 14:01.701
You also told me to not surprise you

14:01.735 --> 14:03.603
when you're peeing,
but you know you love it.

14:04.671 --> 14:05.872
Stick 'em up!
Aah!

14:05.906 --> 14:07.607
Aw, Chet's going to be reunited

14:07.641 --> 14:08.975
with his
long-lost love.

14:09.009 --> 14:10.610
Can't get that at a store.

14:10.644 --> 14:11.644
Where'd you find her?

14:11.678 --> 14:13.613
At a store.
Oh.

14:13.647 --> 14:15.148
I'm gonna break it!
I'm gonna break it!

14:15.182 --> 14:16.549
Oh, crap.
What are we going to do?

14:16.583 --> 14:18.284
You're going to go get Nadine.

14:18.318 --> 14:20.353
That's what you're going to do,
Old St. Dick.

14:20.387 --> 14:22.288
Then Chet will have his lady love,

14:22.322 --> 14:25.458
and maybe he'll help you
give those people their display.

14:25.492 --> 14:26.692
Hmm, that could work.

14:26.727 --> 14:28.194
Go! Use the back door.

14:28.228 --> 14:30.496
I'll stall the
crowd. Go, go.

14:30.531 --> 14:32.498
- Show us the window!
- Yeah!

14:32.533 --> 14:34.000
Show us the window!

14:34.034 --> 14:35.835
Now!
Show us the win...

15:06.733 --> 15:08.367

her at the dump.

Finders keepers.

15:09.636 --> 15:10.870
Okay, fine.

15:10.904 --> 15:12.738
But, um, could I...
could I borrow her

15:12.773 --> 15:14.207
just till the end of the day?

15:14.241 --> 15:15.875

15:51.011 --> 15:53.428
What?
No, not you guys.

15:56.469 --> 15:58.444
♪ Bells, bells, bells, bells

15:58.478 --> 16:00.313
♪ Bells, bells, bells, bells,
la, la, la, bells ♪

16:00.364 --> 16:02.114
♪ La, la, la, bells,
la, la, la, bells, la... ♪

16:02.149 --> 16:03.783
Mom, mom.
Wh-What? Wh-Wh-What?

16:03.817 --> 16:05.501
All right!

16:05.536 --> 16:07.480
Chet, we found Nadine.

16:07.538 --> 16:09.289
And we only dropped her twice.

16:09.323 --> 16:11.208
You-you... you found her?
Yes, she's right here.

16:11.242 --> 16:12.976
Oh, my God, that's...
Wait a minute.

16:13.010 --> 16:15.227
I don't... I'm not sure
I want her to see me like this.

16:15.347 --> 16:17.850
This track suit is 12
seasons old, I've got a gut...

16:17.970 --> 16:20.133
Oh, don't worry.
Nadine's changed, too.

16:20.168 --> 16:21.768
Yeah, come out, Chet, please.

16:21.803 --> 16:24.337
It-it...
she really misses you.

16:24.372 --> 16:26.306
I don't know. What
about all the stuff

16:26.340 --> 16:28.275
you said about how
I was never a mannequin?

16:28.309 --> 16:29.543
Bob...

16:29.577 --> 16:32.179
Look, um, I'm sorry I said that.

16:32.213 --> 16:34.214
I... I do think
you need help.

16:34.248 --> 16:36.650
But before you get help, we need help.

16:36.684 --> 16:37.884
So you still don't believe me.

16:37.919 --> 16:40.387
Um, no, but all that matters

16:40.421 --> 16:42.823
is you're a man now,
in love with the mannequin

16:42.857 --> 16:44.624
who I'm holding by the arm

16:44.659 --> 16:46.460
but should be in yours.

16:46.494 --> 16:48.495
Wow. I got to say
that really hit me.

16:48.529 --> 16:49.830
Okay, so open the door.

16:55.887 --> 16:57.721
Tough times, huh, Baby?

16:57.755 --> 16:59.589
Well, I don't care what you had to do.

16:59.624 --> 17:01.057
I missed you.

17:01.092 --> 17:02.659
I've changed?
Well...

17:02.693 --> 17:05.028
Yeah, I like your hair
that way. It's...

17:05.061 --> 17:06.930
Uh-huh. Mm-hmm.

17:06.964 --> 17:08.598
Uh-huh, yeah.
Well, I was...

17:08.633 --> 17:10.599
Uh-huh. Right.

17:10.635 --> 17:11.867
Chet's a really good listener.

17:11.903 --> 17:13.869
That's important to a woman.

17:13.905 --> 17:15.271
Lin, she's a mannequin.

17:15.306 --> 17:17.107
Who won't shut up, apparently.

17:17.141 --> 17:18.708
Hey, uh, guys, sorry to interrupt.

17:18.742 --> 17:20.343
Did, uh... did
Nadine say anything

17:20.377 --> 17:22.244
about getting that window display going?

17:22.280 --> 17:24.580
'Cause we... we really need
to finish strong here.

17:24.615 --> 17:25.932
What do you think, Nadine?

17:25.967 --> 17:27.501
Yes.

17:27.535 --> 17:29.019
What? What is...
what is she saying?

17:29.053 --> 17:31.087
She's cracking one of her spoofs.

17:31.122 --> 17:33.723
What's a spoof?
Just one of her goof-abouts.

17:33.758 --> 17:35.108
You mean like a joke or...?

17:35.143 --> 17:36.376
Nadine, you still got it.

17:36.410 --> 17:37.844
Yeah, she wants to do it.

17:37.879 --> 17:40.230
That's great.
What was the joke?

17:40.248 --> 17:42.949
Trust me, you won't get it.

17:42.984 --> 17:45.785
And remember, look alive
but absolutely still.

17:45.820 --> 17:47.754
And... no action!

17:47.788 --> 17:50.056
Uh, thanks for waiting, everyone.

17:50.091 --> 17:53.693
I now give you...
Christmas!

17:55.129 --> 17:56.796
It was worth it.

17:56.831 --> 17:58.398
Mort, I want to take a picture.

17:58.432 --> 18:00.984
Fix the wig.
No, your mom's.

18:01.018 --> 18:03.153
Okay, who needs a gift certificate?
Thief!

18:03.187 --> 18:04.821
You stole my girl.
I want her back!

18:04.856 --> 18:06.072
Oh, no.

18:06.107 --> 18:07.490
Hand her over.

18:07.525 --> 18:08.642
Sorry. She's
with me now.

18:08.676 --> 18:10.927
We'll see about that.

18:10.962 --> 18:12.913
Okay, easy.
Easy, guys.

18:12.947 --> 18:15.415
Yeah, peace on Earth, smut peddler!

18:15.449 --> 18:16.816
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Aah!

18:16.851 --> 18:17.984
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

18:18.019 --> 18:20.437
Whoa, manger danger!
Aah!

18:20.471 --> 18:21.438
Come on, stop.

18:21.472 --> 18:22.806
That's a fresh take.

18:22.840 --> 18:24.741
This crèche is crap!

18:26.177 --> 18:27.410
You're lucky I don't

18:27.445 --> 18:29.012
call the cops on you pervs.

18:29.046 --> 18:31.081
Can't we just buy her from you, please?

18:31.115 --> 18:32.282
She's not for sale.

18:32.316 --> 18:34.651
Every sex shop owner has his price.

18:34.685 --> 18:35.685
Five grand.

18:35.720 --> 18:36.753
What? No.

18:36.787 --> 18:38.288
What about...

18:38.306 --> 18:42.125
two hundred and sixty-one,
two, three dollars?

18:42.143 --> 18:43.593
No, Louise, that's the money

18:43.628 --> 18:45.629
we were going to use
to buy you kids presents.

18:45.663 --> 18:48.031
Okay, that is not enough
for an apartment.

18:48.065 --> 18:50.200
You can spend my gift money on Nadine.

18:50.234 --> 18:52.602
Oh, your dry erase board.

18:52.637 --> 18:54.137
You can use my money, too.

18:54.171 --> 18:56.339
Oh, your Jamaican bobsled.

18:56.374 --> 18:57.807
Fine. I'm in.

18:57.842 --> 19:00.710
But I better get a heck
of a Presidents Day gift.

19:00.745 --> 19:02.045
Seriously?
You're all willing

19:02.079 --> 19:04.014
to give up your
Christmas presents for Chet?

19:04.048 --> 19:05.382
Aw.

19:06.717 --> 19:09.185
What the hell?
Give me the money.

19:09.220 --> 19:11.471
Well, here you go, Chet.
Thanks, Bob.

19:11.505 --> 19:13.773
Sorry we busted up your display.
Mm-hmm.

19:13.808 --> 19:15.141
After everything you did for me.

19:15.176 --> 19:18.144
Roof over my head,
Nadine back in my arms.

19:18.179 --> 19:19.613
All right, you know what?

19:19.647 --> 19:21.314
You don't need to be out by tomorrow.

19:21.349 --> 19:22.682
Really, Bobby?
You mean it?

19:22.717 --> 19:24.484
Yeah, stay till New Year's.

19:25.720 --> 19:27.220
Aw.
I'll make punch.

19:27.255 --> 19:28.688
No!

19:28.723 --> 19:31.391
Look at us, Bob, with
our special ladies, huh?

19:31.425 --> 19:33.226
Yeah.
We've got it all, right?

19:33.261 --> 19:35.495
We should take a trip,
the four of us, you know?

19:35.529 --> 19:36.980
Ooh!
Probably not.

19:37.014 --> 19:38.848
I'm flexible, wherever you want go.

19:38.883 --> 19:41.651
I'm... it-it would be hard
for me to get away for a while.

19:41.686 --> 19:43.320
Well, we'll let the ladies
figure it out.

19:43.354 --> 19:45.588
Bermuda!
Does she have a passport?

19:45.623 --> 19:46.990
I can't wait any more, Chet.

19:47.024 --> 19:48.858
Kiss her.

19:49.927 --> 19:51.094
Mmm.

19:51.128 --> 19:52.395
Ugh.

19:52.430 --> 19:54.164
No!
Oh, God.

19:54.198 --> 19:56.366
Pick it up, Chet.
Five-second rule.

20:01.756 --> 20:03.757
Oh, are you as hot as I am right now?

20:03.791 --> 20:05.258
Whoa.
Are you hot?

20:05.293 --> 20:07.327
I'm fine. Never mind.

20:07.361 --> 20:09.596
I think they love it.

20:09.630 --> 20:11.564
Oh, my God, it's happening.

20:11.599 --> 20:13.333
The kiss is turning her human.

20:13.367 --> 20:15.885
No, wait, it's turning him
back into a mannequin.

20:15.903 --> 20:17.887
No, wait, nothing's happening.

20:17.922 --> 20:19.689
They went too far.
I'm out of here.

20:19.724 --> 20:21.408
Merry Christmas, Teddy.
Happy holidays, Mort.

20:21.442 --> 20:22.942
Happy holidays.

20:22.977 --> 20:24.461
Merry Christmas, guys.

20:24.495 --> 20:26.763
Burn in hell, Belchers!

20:30.434 --> 20:31.701
Uncle Ernie's storage unit

20:31.736 --> 20:33.770
had some real treasures after all.

20:33.804 --> 20:35.622
An exit sign.
Thanks, Santa.

20:35.656 --> 20:38.124
Now I can go out any door I want.

20:38.159 --> 20:40.126
I got a shoe sizer.
Eight and a half.

20:40.161 --> 20:42.479
I got a tool to remove security tags.

20:42.513 --> 20:44.781
Next Christmas is on me!

20:44.815 --> 20:46.216
So, Chet...

20:46.250 --> 20:48.485
what are you going to do
after we kick you out?

20:48.519 --> 20:50.787
Oh, don't worry. We'll probably
stay at my place in Manhattan.

20:50.821 --> 20:52.439
I have a loft that was being renovated,

20:52.473 --> 20:54.557
and I cannot wait
to see how it turned out.

20:54.591 --> 20:56.393
What?!
