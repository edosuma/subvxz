WEBVTT

00:06.625 --> 00:08.041
Come on, Andi!

00:30.250 --> 00:31.667
That's it, Andi!
That's a winner!

00:35.250 --> 00:36.375
Match point.

00:38.250 --> 00:39.959
I need a sec.

00:42.500 --> 00:43.875
Be right here.

00:54.083 --> 00:57.083
- That's my sister.
- I know. Everyone knows.

00:57.166 --> 00:58.333
(female #1)
'Close it out, Andi.'

00:58.417 --> 00:59.458
One more, and
you're on the
map

00:59.542 --> 01:00.959
with Billie Jean.

01:01.041 --> 01:02.750
Fritz goes the way of Bobby.

01:17.750 --> 01:19.875
Run around it!

01:27.333 --> 01:28.875
Put it away!

01:31.500 --> 01:33.291
Yes! Attagirl, Andi.

01:35.250 --> 01:37.250
Yes! Yes!

01:50.083 --> 01:51.667
Nice match.

01:51.750 --> 01:53.041
You've come a
long way,
baby.

01:53.125 --> 01:54.500
Ha, ha.

01:54.583 --> 01:56.333
Enjoy your moment, superstar.

02:57.917 --> 03:01.083
My sister was a great
tennis player.

03:01.166 --> 03:03.125
"Born with a racket,"
as they say.

03:03.208 --> 03:04.667
She played
for Penn
University?

03:04.750 --> 03:07.250
Number one varsity,
her first year.

03:07.333 --> 03:09.041
Sounds like a star.

03:09.125 --> 03:10.583
My dad said
given another year or two

03:10.667 --> 03:12.000
she would have gone
to Wimbledon.

03:12.083 --> 03:14.625
But then she was murdered.

03:14.709 --> 03:17.834
Remember Billie Jean King
and Bobby Riggs?

03:17.917 --> 03:20.417
Battle of the Sexes. We won.

03:20.500 --> 03:22.291
Few weeks later
Penn U had its own version

03:22.375 --> 03:23.792
of that match
for a fund-raiser.

03:23.875 --> 03:27.333
- Andi for the ladies?
- And like Billie Jean, she
won.

03:27.417 --> 03:29.041
The next morning,
she was found dead.

03:29.125 --> 03:32.458
'Strangled, in her room.'

03:32.542 --> 03:34.208
Cops look at the guy she beat?

03:34.291 --> 03:36.709
- For quite a while.
- Nothing stuck?

03:38.417 --> 03:41.291
Then her case
just kind of stalled.

03:41.375 --> 03:45.291
It's been a dark cloud
hanging over us, 33 years.

03:45.375 --> 03:46.792
Sure.

03:46.875 --> 03:48.834
What brings you in now, Emily?

03:48.917 --> 03:50.125
My dad's moving to Florida.

03:50.208 --> 03:51.583
I've been cleaning
out his house.

03:51.667 --> 03:53.875
I found a bunch
of Andi's old tennis stuff

03:53.959 --> 03:55.667
including this.

03:55.750 --> 03:57.166
Is that a towel?

03:57.250 --> 03:58.667
The one she used
the night of the match.

03:58.750 --> 04:01.834
It was still in her bag.
I got sick after I handled it.

04:01.917 --> 04:04.458
Poison Control found
traces of sodium
nitrate.

04:04.542 --> 04:07.041
It's, uh, lethal in high doses.

04:07.125 --> 04:09.041
Someone really
wanted to hurt Andi.

04:09.125 --> 04:10.625
I don't wanna be a bother

04:10.709 --> 04:14.000
but I thought maybe
it was related to her murder.

04:14.083 --> 04:17.000
Could have been
the doer's first attempt.

04:17.083 --> 04:18.250
So..

04:18.333 --> 04:20.250
...find out
who dosed this towel.

04:20.333 --> 04:23.542
Maybe we find the person
who brought down a rising
star.

05:09.250 --> 05:11.875
- What'd you do this time?
- Nothin'.

05:11.959 --> 05:15.291
Ah, I missed dinner.
Big deal, right?

05:15.375 --> 05:19.041
'Cause of work, or
because you were at the
bar?

05:19.125 --> 05:20.250
Ran into a guy I know.

05:20.333 --> 05:22.709
I buy one, he buys one, we talk.

05:22.792 --> 05:25.166
Next thing I know, it's 2:30.

05:25.250 --> 05:26.667
Julie wait up?

05:26.750 --> 05:29.041
In that creepy
rocking chair I hate.

05:29.125 --> 05:30.792
You gotta do
something about
this.

05:32.709 --> 05:34.375
It's a circle game.

05:34.458 --> 05:36.917
It'll work out.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.709
- So where are we going?
- Victim's family.

05:39.792 --> 05:45.083
Coed strangled after a
"Battle
of the Sexes" tennis match.

05:45.166 --> 05:47.208
I'll need an egg sandwich
for this one.

05:53.125 --> 05:55.500
Andi Simmons, 18.

05:55.583 --> 05:57.333
'Found strangled
in her dorm room'

05:57.417 --> 05:59.750
day after her big win.

05:59.834 --> 06:01.166
No sign of forced entry.

06:01.250 --> 06:03.625
So she knew her attacker.
Any candidates?

06:03.709 --> 06:06.125
A Fritz Adams, the guy she beat.

06:06.208 --> 06:09.250
Men's number one player,
cops' number one suspect.

06:09.333 --> 06:11.834
Senior guy loses
to a freshman girl?

06:11.917 --> 06:13.583
It's kinda hard to live down.

06:13.667 --> 06:15.792
Especially when it's
splashed
all over the front page.

06:15.875 --> 06:17.417
No alibi, but they still
couldn't build

06:17.500 --> 06:20.834
the case against him. Family
lawyered him up. Job fizzled.

06:20.917 --> 06:23.542
Other lead was some hang-up
phone calls Andi was getting.

06:23.625 --> 06:26.125
Someone calling
and whispering "Superstar."

06:26.208 --> 06:28.917
- Could've been Fritz?
- Oh, he never copped to it.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.750
Any chance this
poisoned
towel was a prank?

06:31.834 --> 06:34.041
Well, the dose
was practically lethal.

06:34.125 --> 06:36.458
Where did they get
the sodium nitrate?

06:36.542 --> 06:40.458
Chemistry building at Penn U
is right next to the courts.

06:40.542 --> 06:42.625
Well, the towel narrows it
down to someone close to Andi.

06:42.709 --> 06:45.291
With access to her gear,
the night of the match.

06:45.375 --> 06:46.959
Thins out the suspect pool.

06:47.041 --> 06:49.500
Vera and Jeffries are with
the family, getting names.

06:49.583 --> 06:52.625
Well...we already know one.

06:52.709 --> 06:53.875
Fritz.

06:53.959 --> 06:56.834
Might as well
start
with the top guy.

07:03.083 --> 07:05.083
(Jeffries)
'See you're pulling up
stakes.'

07:05.166 --> 07:06.166
Yeah.

07:06.250 --> 07:07.917
Dad's had enough Philly winters.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.667
My sister lives in Palm Beach.

07:09.750 --> 07:11.333
It'll be nice
to live near family.

07:13.083 --> 07:14.417
(Vera)
'So this towel Emily found'

07:14.500 --> 07:16.291
could be a new
direction
on Andi's murder.

07:16.375 --> 07:19.000
If my girl was poisoned,
I don't see why you missed
it.

07:19.083 --> 07:20.500
Cause of death
was
strangulation.

07:20.583 --> 07:21.709
I know that.

07:21.792 --> 07:24.625
And standard autopsy
doesn't test for
poison.

07:24.709 --> 07:27.291
The point is,
someone had it out for Andi.

07:27.375 --> 07:29.000
Any ideas why?

07:29.083 --> 07:30.667
Envy.

07:30.750 --> 07:32.041
'Cause of her talent?

07:32.125 --> 07:34.125
What she had was rare.

07:34.208 --> 07:36.041
This was no
dime a dozen
kid.

07:36.125 --> 07:38.166
Know who might have tampered
with her gear that night

07:38.250 --> 07:39.583
planted this towel?

07:39.667 --> 07:41.041
Course I do.

07:41.125 --> 07:43.792
The guy you've been
looking at for 33 years.

07:43.875 --> 07:45.083
Fritz Adams.

07:45.166 --> 07:47.709
Maybe this towel
finally nails the bastard.

07:47.792 --> 07:51.250
'Cause I know for a fact
he loaned her another one.

07:51.333 --> 07:52.709
When was that?

07:52.792 --> 07:55.709
Week before the big match.

07:55.792 --> 07:57.375
Saw it with my own eyes.

08:17.667 --> 08:18.792
Run around that, Andi.

08:23.583 --> 08:24.875
I would've had it, but..

08:24.959 --> 08:25.959
...I broke a string.

08:36.125 --> 08:37.709
You sweat a lot for a girl.

08:37.792 --> 08:39.333
Borg sweats a lot.

08:39.417 --> 08:40.917
Is that what the
headband's about?

08:41.000 --> 08:44.417
Okay, you got your racket.
Get back out there, kiddo.

08:44.500 --> 08:46.208
You know, most people,
when they go away to
college

08:46.291 --> 08:48.583
bring their
stereo,
not their dad.

08:48.667 --> 08:50.125
Your serve.

09:04.667 --> 09:06.750
Argh! Damn it!

09:07.875 --> 09:10.875
Screw this!
Screw this match!

09:10.959 --> 09:12.208
- Fritz. Calm down.
- This is rigged.

09:12.291 --> 09:14.166
- Lose, lose.
- What's your problem?

09:14.250 --> 09:15.542
I'm screwed, that's my problem.

09:15.625 --> 09:17.291
I never should've
agreed to this thing.

09:17.375 --> 09:19.667
It doesn't help me if I win.
I'm supposed to win.

09:19.750 --> 09:21.333
You're a girl.

09:21.417 --> 09:22.458
Thanks a lot.

09:22.542 --> 09:25.458
But if I lose, I'm over.

09:25.542 --> 09:27.208
So win.

09:33.875 --> 09:36.458
Fritz made a big show
of laughing it off

09:36.542 --> 09:38.458
when Andi won the big match

09:38.542 --> 09:40.875
but I'd seen his true colors.

09:40.959 --> 09:42.583
All his fears come true?

09:42.667 --> 09:45.333
He tanked the season.

09:45.417 --> 09:47.583
Never even tried the pros.

09:47.667 --> 09:49.041
You see him with Andi

09:49.125 --> 09:51.041
after the match at all?

09:51.125 --> 09:54.792
Last time we saw her was out
on court one after her win.

09:54.875 --> 09:57.667
Surrounded by people
toasting her.

09:57.750 --> 10:00.500
Right, Em?

10:00.583 --> 10:03.208
It's how I always remember her.

10:03.291 --> 10:07.333
Yeah. Nothing's been
right since.

10:07.417 --> 10:09.583
Lost the brightest light
in my life.

10:20.542 --> 10:23.000
Fritz Adams?

10:23.083 --> 10:24.500
Hi, there.

10:24.583 --> 10:25.875
Here for the ladies' clinic?

10:26.000 --> 10:28.333
Do we look like we're here
for the ladies' clinic?

10:28.417 --> 10:31.709
- What then?
- Detective Rush, Miller.

10:31.792 --> 10:33.208
It's about
Andi Simmons.

10:36.083 --> 10:38.875
I've been down this
road
way too many times.

10:38.959 --> 10:42.542
The towel turned up, Fritz.

10:42.625 --> 10:43.875
That supposed to mean
something to me?

10:43.959 --> 10:46.542
You tell us.

10:46.625 --> 10:47.709
I give up.

10:47.792 --> 10:49.875
The towel Andi
used at your match

10:49.959 --> 10:51.583
was laced with sodium nitrate.

10:51.667 --> 10:52.875
Sodium what?

10:52.959 --> 10:55.000
Ladies, I'm a jock.
I don't do
chemicals.

10:55.083 --> 10:57.208
Well, maybe fear of
getting whipped by a
girl

10:57.291 --> 10:59.542
got you to crack a book.

10:59.625 --> 11:00.750
I lost a match.

11:00.834 --> 11:02.542
That's no reason
to kill someone.

11:02.625 --> 11:04.583
Unless your temper
got the best of you.

11:04.667 --> 11:06.083
We hear you had
a real meltdown

11:06.166 --> 11:08.417
with Andi at a practice match.

11:08.500 --> 11:10.750
You ever see John McEnroe
chuck a racket?

11:10.834 --> 11:11.875
That's just tennis.

11:11.959 --> 11:12.917
But after she beat you

11:13.000 --> 11:15.125
you lost any chance
of going pro.

11:15.208 --> 11:18.000
I had a one-time
problem with
Andi.

11:18.083 --> 11:19.291
That was nothing
compared to the
girls

11:19.375 --> 11:21.000
she was with day to day.

11:21.083 --> 11:22.542
Her teammates?

11:22.625 --> 11:25.750
Talk about a bunch of
hens
with ruffled feathers.

11:25.834 --> 11:27.500
Who was the most ruffled?

11:29.125 --> 11:31.250
Grace Andersen.

11:31.333 --> 11:34.125
- The team captain?
- And my girlfriend at the
time.

11:37.583 --> 11:39.333
She have something
against skirts?

11:39.417 --> 11:43.333
Let's just say she's
more Billie Jean than
Chrissie.

11:43.417 --> 11:45.625
She's been in the paper
like three times this week.

11:45.709 --> 11:47.750
Four.

11:47.834 --> 11:49.709
Oh! Thanks for joining us.

11:49.792 --> 11:51.166
Am I late? I'm sorry.

11:51.250 --> 11:53.125
- We have a challenge match.
- I know.

11:53.208 --> 11:56.667
It was supposed to
start 10 minutes
ago.

11:56.750 --> 11:58.625
I was doing an interview.

11:58.709 --> 12:01.125
We all know
you're a big superstar,
Andi.

12:01.208 --> 12:02.959
- But tennis should come
first.
- You're right.

12:03.041 --> 12:04.959
- This guy just kept talking.
- Tell him you have practice.

12:05.041 --> 12:06.834
And that being
late
is frowned upon.

12:06.917 --> 12:08.792
I will. Promise.

12:08.875 --> 12:12.041
Look, why don't you take a game
for every minute I'm late?

12:12.125 --> 12:14.083
Oh, right.

12:14.166 --> 12:15.959
No, I mean it.
I deserve it.

12:16.041 --> 12:17.375
It's 6-0, 4-0 yours.

12:17.458 --> 12:20.375
Two games away from winning.
And you can serve.

12:28.375 --> 12:29.583
Andi still won?

12:29.667 --> 12:32.792
0-6, 6-4, 6-0.

12:32.875 --> 12:34.500
Grace didn't take a game?

12:34.583 --> 12:37.458
She was a good captain,
didn't vent in public.

12:37.542 --> 12:39.750
- But behind closed doors?
- Yeah.

12:39.834 --> 12:41.166
She had a lot of bad nights.

12:41.250 --> 12:43.333
Andi was making her crazy.

12:43.417 --> 12:46.625
Think she could have
poisoned this towel?

12:46.709 --> 12:49.667
Grace was a grind,
on the court and
off.

12:49.750 --> 12:52.750
Doesn't sound like
an answer to me.

12:52.834 --> 12:54.000
She was a chem major.

12:54.083 --> 12:55.583
Spent half her time in the lab

12:55.667 --> 12:58.500
and the other
half
on the court.

12:58.583 --> 13:01.000
Giving her means, motive..

13:01.083 --> 13:02.583
And opportunity.

13:09.917 --> 13:12.333
So Andi's a phenom

13:12.417 --> 13:13.709
Grace is a grinder.

13:13.792 --> 13:15.041
(Jeffries)
'And they hate each other.'

13:15.125 --> 13:17.083
Like Mozart and...
that other guy.

13:17.166 --> 13:19.875
Exactly. Saw it when
I played college ball.

13:19.959 --> 13:21.208
No one hates God-given talent

13:21.291 --> 13:23.000
like a second-stringer.

13:23.083 --> 13:25.000
Excuse me.
You're Will, right?

13:27.083 --> 13:28.333
Yes.

13:28.417 --> 13:30.083
I'm Julie, Nick Vera's wife.

13:32.417 --> 13:34.125
Of course, uh..

13:34.208 --> 13:36.375
This is John Stillman
and Scotty Valens.

13:36.458 --> 13:38.542
- Nice to meet you.
- Same here.

13:38.625 --> 13:40.208
Nicky says nice things.

13:40.291 --> 13:43.917
Well, he's out on the
street.
Have a seat. I'll call him.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.375
We got some god-awful coffee.

13:46.458 --> 13:48.458
No, that's okay.

13:48.542 --> 13:51.208
Could you just give him this?

13:51.291 --> 13:53.166
Uh, sure.

13:53.250 --> 13:55.583
(Julie)
'Thanks.'

13:55.667 --> 13:58.959
- Nice seeing you again.
- Yeah.

13:59.041 --> 14:01.000
Bye.

14:04.333 --> 14:06.500
Way to go.

14:06.583 --> 14:07.458
Crap.

14:07.542 --> 14:09.333
I met her once,
four years ago.

14:09.417 --> 14:10.834
That'll help his cause

14:10.917 --> 14:12.750
trying to get
out of the woodshed.

14:12.834 --> 14:14.458
I didn't know
things were so
bad.

14:14.542 --> 14:17.000
Well, he didn't
seem worried yesterday.

14:17.875 --> 14:19.500
But this ain't a good sign.

14:25.834 --> 14:28.458
(Rush)
'Met your old
boyfriend, Grace.'

14:28.542 --> 14:29.583
Fritz Adams?

14:29.667 --> 14:32.166
Oh, really? Is he bald and fat?

14:32.250 --> 14:33.792
I take it
you're not in touch.

14:33.875 --> 14:36.083
Uh, things didn't
end well with us.

14:36.166 --> 14:39.166
Uh, he said you had a
little
problem with Andi Simmons.

14:39.250 --> 14:40.458
Oh, I wouldn't call it little.

14:40.542 --> 14:42.083
A lot of fur flying
between you two?

14:42.166 --> 14:43.959
I was number one
for three years

14:44.041 --> 14:45.917
and then Andi takes it away.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.792
For a high-strung,
Type-A bulimic like me?

14:48.875 --> 14:51.208
- Big problem.
- You work all that out?

14:51.291 --> 14:53.000
- Yes, thanks.
- Yeah.

14:53.083 --> 14:54.959
So when Andi
and Fritz
played

14:55.041 --> 14:58.291
in the "Battle of the
Sexes"
who were you rooting
for?

14:58.375 --> 14:59.792
Oh, I was Switzerland, neutral.

14:59.875 --> 15:02.041
I know if I'm
choosing
between my boyfriend

15:02.125 --> 15:06.125
and a girl I
despise,
I'm going with the
guy.

15:06.208 --> 15:08.709
Maybe that's where
the towel comes in.

15:08.792 --> 15:13.041
Andi's towel was
laced
with sodium nitrate.

15:13.125 --> 15:14.792
And I'm Marie Curie?

15:14.875 --> 15:16.125
Crossed our mind.

15:16.208 --> 15:18.208
I had a lot of things
to work through back then.

15:18.291 --> 15:20.375
Aforementioned emotional issues.

15:20.458 --> 15:21.333
But?

15:21.417 --> 15:22.500
I was in a study group the night

15:22.583 --> 15:24.500
she was killed, for one thing

15:24.583 --> 15:25.959
with three other people.

15:26.041 --> 15:27.333
We'll need those names.

15:27.417 --> 15:29.041
And more importantly Andi's win

15:29.125 --> 15:30.875
actually meant
something to me.

15:30.959 --> 15:33.166
Women's lib, you know.

15:33.250 --> 15:34.375
Oh, boy.

15:34.458 --> 15:36.583
Was Andi
a big
activist?

15:36.667 --> 15:40.083
No...and that was a problem.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.291
You look great, you know.

15:54.375 --> 15:56.083
You don't have to do that.

15:59.834 --> 16:02.208
MYOB, okay?

16:08.917 --> 16:11.375
"I don't really have
an opinion about Title IX.

16:11.458 --> 16:13.667
I just want to play tennis."

16:13.750 --> 16:16.125
- What?
- Tell me you were misquoted.

16:16.208 --> 16:17.500
Um...no.

16:17.583 --> 16:21.041
Title IX
protects
women athletes.

16:21.125 --> 16:23.083
I just think of myself
as an athlete.

16:23.166 --> 16:24.333
Hey.

16:24.417 --> 16:26.333
leave your little backyard, kid.

16:26.417 --> 16:28.917
- There's a revolution going
on.
- Huh?

16:29.000 --> 16:31.250
Ever wonder why we have to use
the chem building bathroom

16:31.333 --> 16:33.041
to change for practice?

16:33.125 --> 16:34.500
I guess I never
thought about
it.

16:34.583 --> 16:36.291
The guys have a locker room.

16:36.375 --> 16:39.083
According to Fritz,
it's beautiful.

16:39.166 --> 16:41.750
(female #1)
'Title IX gets us
a locker room, a van'

16:41.834 --> 16:44.667
decent budget, same as the guys.

16:44.750 --> 16:47.458
I care about
tennis,
not politics.

16:47.542 --> 16:51.417
Hey, Bambi, wake up!
This is our moment.

16:51.500 --> 16:53.750
You're our golden girl.

16:53.834 --> 16:55.583
I'm not gonna
let you blow it.

17:01.333 --> 17:03.667
Sounds like the coach
was a dragon lady.

17:03.750 --> 17:05.083
Breathing fire all over Andi.

17:05.166 --> 17:07.417
Lot of sore points between them?

17:07.500 --> 17:10.250
Biggest one was
Andi's dad wanted Susan fired

17:10.333 --> 17:11.375
not that it happened.

17:11.458 --> 17:13.917
'Cause Andi died first.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.583
I guess that's true.

17:16.667 --> 17:19.041
You think Susan
could've harmed her?

17:19.125 --> 17:20.750
She was radical.

17:20.834 --> 17:23.667
Believed in making change
by any means necessary.

17:25.709 --> 17:27.875
I ain't doing that interview.

17:31.709 --> 17:36.291
You remember the "Battle
of the Sexes" match in '73?

17:36.375 --> 17:37.667
Court one, Andi Simmons

17:37.750 --> 17:40.000
brought Fritz Adams
to his knees.

17:40.083 --> 17:42.792
That was a great
day.
I enjoyed it.

17:42.875 --> 17:44.041
Good for the cause.

17:44.125 --> 17:46.125
Knocked the bastards
down a peg.

17:46.208 --> 17:49.792
Fair to say you take a pretty
extreme view on politics?

17:49.875 --> 17:51.125
Have to.

17:51.208 --> 17:54.166
No one gives you an
inch
without a fight.

17:54.250 --> 17:58.250
And now, you've climbed all
the way up to athletic
director.

17:59.875 --> 18:01.959
Say what you mean.

18:02.041 --> 18:04.542
If Andi was getting
in the way of your agenda--

18:04.625 --> 18:05.834
She was good
for my agenda.

18:05.917 --> 18:08.333
She just needed enlightenment.

18:08.417 --> 18:10.834
We also heard her dad
wanted you fired.

18:10.917 --> 18:12.667
'Cause he didn't
wanna stop coaching
her.

18:12.750 --> 18:16.500
But after Andi died,
you kept your job.

18:16.583 --> 18:19.959
- I hear you.
- So?

18:20.041 --> 18:21.208
Bill was a tennis dad

18:21.291 --> 18:23.667
overreaching pain in the ass.

18:23.750 --> 18:25.083
We tussled over Andi.

18:25.166 --> 18:26.750
Both wanted your piece of her.

18:26.834 --> 18:28.375
'Cause she was so special.

18:28.458 --> 18:31.375
But we came together
when we ran into a real enemy.

18:36.834 --> 18:38.792
Run around,
run around...nice!

18:39.625 --> 18:41.625
And put it away!

18:46.250 --> 18:48.458
We just had
a three hour practice, Bill.

18:48.542 --> 18:51.041
- Don't start.
- She's my player.

18:51.125 --> 18:53.041
Who put a racket in her hands
when she was four years old?

18:53.125 --> 18:55.083
Was that you, Susan,
or was that me?

18:55.166 --> 18:56.375
So this is the superstar

18:56.458 --> 18:58.667
they're all talking about.

18:58.750 --> 18:59.959
Arnold Brown, athletic director.

19:00.041 --> 19:03.000
Oh, hey, hello,
good to meet
you.

19:03.083 --> 19:04.375
Bill and Andi Simmons.

19:04.458 --> 19:06.875
They say you're
the next Billie Jean King.

19:06.959 --> 19:08.208
I'd like to be.

19:08.291 --> 19:10.458
And I hear there's a
"Battle of the Sexes"

19:10.542 --> 19:11.875
match scheduled?

19:11.959 --> 19:13.208
Fritz Adams and I are playing.

19:13.291 --> 19:16.208
Number one against number one.

19:16.291 --> 19:18.208
Sounds like something
you dreamed up, Susan.

19:18.291 --> 19:20.041
Just trying to raise money,
since we've got

19:20.125 --> 19:22.709
such a crap budget.

19:22.792 --> 19:23.709
Let me guess.

19:23.792 --> 19:25.041
The trolls at the Women's Center

19:25.125 --> 19:27.041
put you up to this.

19:27.125 --> 19:30.917
No, I wanna play.
I wanna win.

19:31.000 --> 19:34.000
Well, that certainly
would be interesting

19:34.083 --> 19:38.375
uh, but problematic too.

19:38.458 --> 19:40.000
Why?

19:40.083 --> 19:42.208
These are complicated
times, Andi.

19:42.291 --> 19:43.709
A lot of demands being made.

19:43.792 --> 19:46.250
I'm just going out
there to play.

19:46.333 --> 19:47.750
It's not complicated for me.

19:47.834 --> 19:51.333
Still, this Title IX
business
is a slippery slope.

19:51.417 --> 19:52.875
'We don't want to
embarrass the university'

19:52.959 --> 19:55.542
and we have an
obligation
to men's athletics.

19:55.625 --> 19:56.834
(Bill)
Embarrass?
This kid is dynamite.

19:56.917 --> 19:58.583
She's gonna make you proud.

19:58.667 --> 20:02.542
It's harmless enough
to have an exhibition
game.

20:02.625 --> 20:04.417
But an upset could stir the pot.

20:04.500 --> 20:07.834
It'll be bad for everyone.

20:07.917 --> 20:11.291
You mean,
I should throw the match?

20:11.375 --> 20:14.250
Due respect, I doubt
Fritz needs the help.

20:14.333 --> 20:16.417
You haven't seen
what this girl can do.

20:16.500 --> 20:19.000
And I always play to win.

20:19.083 --> 20:20.458
Maybe I wasn't clear.

20:20.542 --> 20:23.750
An upset is not a possibility.

20:23.834 --> 20:25.333
And I'll be watching.

20:33.750 --> 20:35.959
To him, that was the last word.

20:36.041 --> 20:38.458
He was so sure
Andi would just obey him.

20:38.542 --> 20:39.875
And lose on purpose?

20:39.959 --> 20:43.125
In his mind,
that's what they had agreed
to.

20:43.208 --> 20:44.792
But then Andi won.

20:44.875 --> 20:46.917
And was dead the next day.

20:52.750 --> 20:55.083
Well, Penn
athletic director, Arnold
Brown

20:55.166 --> 20:56.917
died four years ago.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.834
Dead suspect? Love that.

20:58.917 --> 21:00.166
He's all over these articles

21:00.250 --> 21:01.959
on Title IX, big opponent.

21:02.041 --> 21:03.500
The same guy
who wrote those stories

21:03.583 --> 21:06.834
covered Andi and
women's tennis, Eric Witt.

21:06.917 --> 21:08.375
I know that name.

21:08.458 --> 21:10.834
He writes a sports column
for the Philly Post.

21:10.917 --> 21:12.667
Well, maybe he can tell
you how the AD took it

21:12.750 --> 21:14.000
when Andi disobeyed him.

21:14.083 --> 21:15.875
Heading over there.

21:19.083 --> 21:21.750
You doing okay, Nicky?

21:21.834 --> 21:23.500
Going home tonight.

21:23.583 --> 21:25.500
By invitation?

21:25.583 --> 21:27.875
Ambush.

21:27.959 --> 21:29.500
She'll give me
her "Come to
Jesus"

21:29.583 --> 21:30.709
I'll beg forgiveness

21:30.792 --> 21:33.166
we'll settle back in.

21:33.250 --> 21:35.375
Familiar drill, huh.

21:38.375 --> 21:42.083
One that's getting
less and less interesting.

21:42.166 --> 21:44.333
May be time to change it up.

21:50.166 --> 21:53.083
AD Brown went ballistic
when Andi won that match.

21:53.166 --> 21:56.375
Yeah, because now she's
the poster child for
Title IX.

21:56.458 --> 21:58.333
And he wanted things to
stay just like they were

21:58.417 --> 22:00.458
women athletes,
back of the bus.

22:00.542 --> 22:02.542
So maybe he retaliated
after Andi won?

22:02.625 --> 22:05.291
Actually, I can vouch for
his whereabouts that night.

22:05.375 --> 22:06.291
Yeah?

22:06.375 --> 22:08.667
He was at the paper, with me.

22:08.750 --> 22:11.375
- Doing what?
- Breathing down my neck.

22:11.458 --> 22:13.709
Didn't want me
to glorify her in the
story.

22:13.792 --> 22:16.542
But you kind of did, anyway.

22:16.625 --> 22:18.583
You should have seen
my first draft.

22:18.667 --> 22:20.417
(Jeffries)
'You get any heat from
the other players'

22:20.500 --> 22:22.041
for all the press
you gave Andi?

22:23.333 --> 22:25.333
Grace Andersen didn't like it.

22:25.417 --> 22:27.208
Well, Grace has an alibi.

22:28.792 --> 22:31.333
Kind of relieved to hear that.

22:31.417 --> 22:33.959
Why's that?

22:34.041 --> 22:37.750
There...there was
an incident at a reception.

22:37.834 --> 22:38.709
Go on.

22:38.792 --> 22:40.542
It was the night
before the match

22:40.625 --> 22:42.375
at an athletic alumni event.

22:43.667 --> 22:45.625
Drinks were flowing
pretty good.

23:09.583 --> 23:11.417
Hi, everyone.

23:15.917 --> 23:17.625
Where's the
attractive
headband?

23:25.834 --> 23:28.875
Hey, sport.

23:28.959 --> 23:29.959
What's the problem?

23:30.041 --> 23:30.959
I don't know

23:31.041 --> 23:32.583
what they get out of it.

23:32.667 --> 23:35.709
- Out of what?
- Treating me like that.

23:36.750 --> 23:38.917
Lets them win for
a second...off court

23:39.041 --> 23:40.500
since they can't do it on.

23:42.583 --> 23:45.834
Oh, no! It's the superstar!

23:45.917 --> 23:47.625
Don't say that.

23:47.709 --> 23:49.166
I've been getting
some weird calls.

23:51.250 --> 23:53.333
Well, it's the price of fame.

23:53.417 --> 23:55.000
I come in peace, Andi.

23:55.083 --> 23:56.834
To apologize.

23:56.917 --> 23:59.000
- Forget it.
- No, I gotta!

23:59.750 --> 24:01.125
I gotta apologize..

24:01.208 --> 24:04.208
..for yelling
the other day when we played.

24:04.291 --> 24:05.875
You're yelling now, too.

24:07.125 --> 24:09.208
You're funny.

24:09.291 --> 24:11.375
And, uh...foxy, too.

24:11.458 --> 24:13.500
Fritz, stop it.

24:15.375 --> 24:16.333
You're drunk, sport.

24:16.417 --> 24:18.667
What did you call me, twit boy?

24:26.208 --> 24:28.458
- Hey, Eric.
- Hi, Grace.

24:28.542 --> 24:30.000
Get ready.

24:30.083 --> 24:32.291
You're gonna have
a big story
tomorrow.

24:32.375 --> 24:33.709
What about?

24:33.792 --> 24:36.083
Believe me, you'll know.

24:43.458 --> 24:45.166
You didn't think
to mention this

24:45.250 --> 24:47.041
when Andi turned up dead?

24:47.125 --> 24:50.875
I just...thought
Grace was venting.

24:50.959 --> 24:52.166
Uh-huh.

24:53.792 --> 24:56.250
I plead love-sick college kid.

24:56.333 --> 24:59.166
I never thought my Grace
could hurt someone.

24:59.250 --> 25:00.625
Your Grace?

25:00.709 --> 25:03.125
I'd been covering her
for three years.

25:04.291 --> 25:06.333
Had a crush.

25:06.417 --> 25:08.333
Occupational hazard.

25:08.417 --> 25:10.166
You seeing it
with a clear head now?

25:11.250 --> 25:13.583
Got to admit..

25:13.667 --> 25:16.417
...always wondered
what she meant by that.

25:23.959 --> 25:26.208
(Rush)
'You said you
and Fritz broke up, Grace'

25:26.291 --> 25:28.375
'but never mentioned why.'

25:28.458 --> 25:29.917
He was a bad boyfriend.

25:30.000 --> 25:30.917
Night before the match

25:31.000 --> 25:33.041
we hear he was all over Andi.

25:33.125 --> 25:34.917
Pawing her right
in front of you.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.458
He did that kind of thing.

25:36.542 --> 25:37.667
Charming, huh?

25:37.750 --> 25:40.291
Well...this night,
it ticked you off enough

25:40.375 --> 25:43.500
to promise Eric Witt
a big story.

25:43.583 --> 25:44.667
'Right?'

25:44.750 --> 25:46.834
Premeditation is
Murder One, Grace.

25:46.917 --> 25:48.125
I have an alibi.

25:48.208 --> 25:49.792
So maybe someone else
did your dirty work.

25:49.875 --> 25:52.166
I wasn't talking about Andi,
that wasn't the story.

25:52.250 --> 25:55.125
What then?

25:55.208 --> 25:56.959
The towel.

25:58.166 --> 26:00.959
I soaked it in
sodium nitrate at the chem
lab.

26:02.166 --> 26:04.333
- Okay.
- But the dose wasn't lethal.

26:04.417 --> 26:06.250
I made sure of that.

26:06.333 --> 26:08.625
You wanted to poison Andi
so she'd lose the match?

26:08.709 --> 26:11.500
No, the towel was
meant for Fritz.

26:11.583 --> 26:13.041
Your bad boyfriend.

26:13.125 --> 26:15.500
Have you ever been
dragged through the mud

26:15.583 --> 26:18.750
so many times
by a guy that you..

26:18.834 --> 26:22.083
...lash out in
an inappropriate way?

26:22.166 --> 26:26.333
You consider poisoning
someone "Inappropriate"?

26:26.417 --> 26:28.417
He humiliated me.

26:28.500 --> 26:30.333
So you wanted to
humiliate him.

26:30.417 --> 26:32.125
Make sure he lost.

26:32.208 --> 26:35.041
But he didn't end up
with the towel.

26:35.125 --> 26:38.709
Late in the match Andi
grabbed his towel by mistake.

26:38.792 --> 26:40.667
Afterwards, I tried
to get it back.

26:44.417 --> 26:47.083
Andi?

26:47.166 --> 26:48.834
I feel dizzy.

26:48.917 --> 26:50.250
The champagne, maybe.

26:50.333 --> 26:51.875
Maybe.

26:57.667 --> 26:59.083
You don't have to help me.

26:59.166 --> 27:01.208
I want to.

27:06.583 --> 27:08.542
You were great out there.

27:08.625 --> 27:10.041
(Andi)
'Think maybe now
we'll get the stuff'

27:10.125 --> 27:11.875
Susan wants for the team?

27:11.959 --> 27:13.834
I hope so.

27:13.917 --> 27:15.208
(Andi)
'Me, too.'

27:15.291 --> 27:16.750
'Cause this bathroom
is really bad.

27:22.125 --> 27:23.542
Grace.

27:23.625 --> 27:26.709
I know I screwed it up somehow.

27:26.792 --> 27:30.250
But I'd like to be
friends with you guys.

27:32.417 --> 27:34.333
It wasn't you. It was us.

27:36.083 --> 27:37.792
I think, I have to..

27:37.875 --> 27:40.458
...get better at
being with people.

27:40.542 --> 27:43.125
I've spent so much
time playing tennis, that..

27:43.208 --> 27:45.709
'...the only real friend
I have is my dad.'

27:50.208 --> 27:52.041
We're all going out
tomorrow night.

27:52.125 --> 27:54.792
Trying this new Tex-Mex thing.

27:54.875 --> 27:57.000
You wanna come?

27:57.083 --> 27:58.959
Yeah.

27:59.041 --> 28:00.125
(Bill)
'Andi?'

28:00.208 --> 28:01.875
That's my dad.

28:01.959 --> 28:05.500
(Bill)
'Come on, kiddo, we gotta
go over these numbers.'

28:09.041 --> 28:10.166
Tomorrow night?

28:10.250 --> 28:12.083
Tomorrow night.

28:20.834 --> 28:23.417
Andi's dad took her home?

28:23.500 --> 28:24.834
Yeah.

28:24.917 --> 28:26.834
He didn't tell you that?

28:55.583 --> 28:57.375
Do you really have
to bring this to work?

28:57.458 --> 28:58.750
Embarrass me there?

28:58.834 --> 29:01.375
I don't know
where else to find you.

29:01.458 --> 29:02.792
Okay.

29:05.875 --> 29:06.792
Sitting target.

29:06.875 --> 29:08.875
Throw your daggers.

29:10.166 --> 29:12.000
Something's different this time.

29:12.083 --> 29:14.041
(Vera)
'Really?'

29:14.125 --> 29:16.542
'Cause to me,
it's exactly the same.

29:16.625 --> 29:18.625
I go AWOL for a couple of hours

29:18.709 --> 29:20.542
I don't call you
on the dot when I say I will

29:20.625 --> 29:22.083
and you go off the rails.

29:22.166 --> 29:23.000
Right.

29:23.083 --> 29:24.625
And a small thing like a guy

29:24.709 --> 29:26.917
coming home late turns
into a three hour referendum

29:27.000 --> 29:28.917
on all the cheap things
Nick Vera's ever done.

29:30.875 --> 29:32.125
Not this time.

29:33.625 --> 29:36.166
I get a pass tonight, why?

29:36.250 --> 29:38.709
Usually I wait up and worry.

29:38.792 --> 29:40.542
Where is he?
Who's he with?

29:40.625 --> 29:41.542
Is she pretty?

29:41.625 --> 29:43.166
I've been walking the line.

29:43.250 --> 29:44.709
When your
girlfriend
from high school

29:44.792 --> 29:45.750
showed up last year?

29:45.834 --> 29:47.625
Nothing happened with her.

29:47.709 --> 29:49.250
I came to your work.

29:49.333 --> 29:51.083
I watched you from the car.

29:52.166 --> 29:53.583
To check on me.

29:54.375 --> 29:56.208
No.

29:56.291 --> 29:58.542
To see what you liked.

30:00.125 --> 30:04.542
She was wearing
this beautiful white coat.

30:04.625 --> 30:06.333
So, the next day,
I went out and bought one

30:06.417 --> 30:07.750
just like it.

30:07.834 --> 30:09.250
Oh, Jules.

30:09.333 --> 30:11.917
'Wore it for months.'

30:12.834 --> 30:14.875
'But..'

30:14.959 --> 30:16.917
...you didn't notice.

30:18.125 --> 30:20.083
And it didn't keep you home.

30:24.625 --> 30:26.458
Asking a lot of a coat.

30:30.083 --> 30:31.792
Anyway..

30:31.875 --> 30:33.709
...the other night

30:33.792 --> 30:36.333
I waited.

30:36.417 --> 30:39.125
But I didn't worry.

30:39.208 --> 30:41.500
And when I heard
you come in

30:41.583 --> 30:43.667
I wasn't glad.

30:45.834 --> 30:48.333
I wished you were still gone.

30:51.500 --> 30:53.625
Well, that is different.

31:02.166 --> 31:04.000
I think it's time, Nicky.

31:08.166 --> 31:12.041
- What about, this baby thing?
- What?

31:12.125 --> 31:14.041
Maybe we gotta do it now.

31:14.125 --> 31:16.250
You have to be able to offer
a good home for that.

31:16.333 --> 31:18.291
It could save us, Jules.
Bring us together.

31:18.375 --> 31:20.083
This isn't a good home.

31:24.375 --> 31:26.208
I'm done.

31:26.291 --> 31:28.041
So, you saying this

31:28.125 --> 31:30.125
12 years in?

31:33.375 --> 31:35.667
Talk me out of it.

32:02.083 --> 32:04.625
You told us the last time you
saw Andi was out on court one.

32:04.709 --> 32:05.834
That's right.

32:05.917 --> 32:09.667
But that was a lie.

32:09.750 --> 32:10.792
What?

32:10.875 --> 32:12.125
Someone saw you
leave with her later.

32:12.208 --> 32:14.083
Headed back to the dorm.

32:18.417 --> 32:23.041
I have a...a lot
of regrets in my
life.

32:24.625 --> 32:26.333
The worst one was that night.

32:26.417 --> 32:28.458
Did you hurt your daughter?

32:28.542 --> 32:30.000
Of course not.

32:30.083 --> 32:32.208
Then what?

32:32.291 --> 32:34.291
I've tried to forget it.

32:35.333 --> 32:37.458
Our last conversation.

32:39.083 --> 32:42.000
You had a whole life together,
Bill.

32:42.083 --> 32:45.667
The last time you spoke
doesn't define all that.

32:45.750 --> 32:48.250
I was more than her dad.

32:48.333 --> 32:51.250
I was her coach, her mentor.

32:51.333 --> 32:54.041
And she was my best friend.

32:54.125 --> 32:56.583
I couldn't give that up.

32:56.667 --> 32:59.667
But Andi wanted
something else?

33:01.500 --> 33:03.542
Friends of her own.

33:03.625 --> 33:06.417
A life outside of tennis.

33:07.583 --> 33:09.375
The last time I saw my girl

33:11.667 --> 33:15.250
I was trying to keep
her from any of that.

33:18.250 --> 33:20.208
Nice work out there, kiddo.

33:20.291 --> 33:22.625
Nine unforced
errors,
though.

33:22.709 --> 33:23.917
Two double faults.

33:24.000 --> 33:25.417
Still, I played well.

33:25.500 --> 33:27.417
But you're still using
that overhead backhand.

33:28.333 --> 33:29.375
It just feels right.

33:29.458 --> 33:31.417
But it's not disciplined.

33:31.500 --> 33:32.917
After all the buckets
we did I don't see

33:33.000 --> 33:34.417
why you fall back on junk.

33:34.500 --> 33:36.834
Let's talk
about
it tomorrow?

33:39.625 --> 33:41.750
Were you drinking tonight?

33:41.834 --> 33:45.917
- I had some champagne.
- Andi.

33:46.000 --> 33:47.792
I'm afraid
we're losing our focus.

33:51.917 --> 33:54.000
Who's that at this hour?

33:54.083 --> 33:56.542
'Someone keeps calling
and hanging up.'

33:56.625 --> 33:58.667
- 'Is it a boyfriend?'
- No.

33:58.750 --> 34:01.333
'Cause that would explain
why your tennis is suffering.

34:01.417 --> 34:03.291
I don't have a boyfriend

34:03.375 --> 34:05.709
but I am starting
to make friends.

34:05.792 --> 34:07.125
I think.

34:12.542 --> 34:14.458
You know what?
I made a mistake.

34:14.542 --> 34:15.625
College isn't right for you.

34:15.709 --> 34:16.959
But I'm just
starting to
like it.

34:17.041 --> 34:18.667
It's too distracting.
We should be on the tour.

34:18.750 --> 34:20.792
We'll train for a few months,
hit the tri-state
tournaments..

34:24.667 --> 34:26.792
Hello!

34:26.875 --> 34:28.333
Who is this?

34:32.542 --> 34:33.959
- Dad.
- You sleep off that
alcohol.

34:34.041 --> 34:36.000
- We'll pack up in the
morning.
- But I wanna stay here.

34:36.083 --> 34:38.583
We're going on tour, Andi,
and that's the end of it.

34:38.667 --> 34:39.792
Dad, that's not what I want!

34:39.875 --> 34:41.875
I know what you want
better than you do.

34:41.959 --> 34:43.083
We've got
something special here

34:43.166 --> 34:44.208
and we're not
throwing it away.

34:44.291 --> 34:46.041
- We?
- That's right, we!

34:46.125 --> 34:48.250
Who put a racket in your hand
when you were four years old?

34:48.333 --> 34:49.375
You did.

34:49.458 --> 34:50.500
Who took you to every
tournament?

34:50.583 --> 34:51.834
- Every lesson?
- You.

34:51.917 --> 34:54.458
I spent 14 years
making you what you are.

34:54.542 --> 34:56.667
You act like
you're not even grateful.

35:09.750 --> 35:11.834
I didn't want
her
to get over me.

35:13.917 --> 35:16.542
Didn't matter in the end.

35:16.625 --> 35:18.458
I lost my girl.

35:19.750 --> 35:21.583
You have another girl.

35:24.250 --> 35:25.917
You ever find out
who that caller was?

35:27.458 --> 35:30.709
Wrong number, he said.

35:30.792 --> 35:34.917
Then he...called me something

35:35.000 --> 35:37.333
"Sport."

35:37.417 --> 35:40.041
It stuck with me
because it was
odd.

35:43.125 --> 35:46.834
"Occupational hazard. Falling
for the athletes you covered."

35:46.917 --> 35:48.333
Isn't that what you said?

35:48.417 --> 35:49.959
Yeah.

35:50.041 --> 35:52.166
That's why you
were
sweet on Grace.

35:52.250 --> 35:53.542
Is that a crime?

35:53.625 --> 35:55.834
No, but in '73, you were done

35:55.917 --> 35:57.667
writing about Grace.

35:57.750 --> 35:59.750
Now you were writing about Andi.

36:01.542 --> 36:05.208
I might have nursed
a light crush on her.

36:05.291 --> 36:07.458
Well, you put her photo
in the paper over and
over.

36:07.542 --> 36:10.166
Nothing...lightweig
ht
about that.

36:10.250 --> 36:12.500
Something might've
been growing.

36:12.583 --> 36:15.041
Between you and Andi?

36:15.125 --> 36:17.125
We might even
have ended up together

36:17.208 --> 36:20.291
if she-she wasn't killed.

36:24.041 --> 36:26.000
No.

36:26.083 --> 36:28.250
How would you know?

36:28.333 --> 36:31.583
Well...I know guys like you.

36:31.667 --> 36:33.083
Always setting
your sights too high

36:33.166 --> 36:35.083
on girls that are..

36:35.166 --> 36:37.125
...well, out
of
your league.

36:37.208 --> 36:38.333
That's not true.

36:38.417 --> 36:39.625
And when they give
you the brush-off

36:39.709 --> 36:42.959
you get frustrated...bitter.

36:43.041 --> 36:45.625
"Bitch thinks
she's better than me?"

36:45.709 --> 36:46.875
I don't know what you're saying.

36:46.959 --> 36:49.583
Andi didn't have
feelings for you.

36:49.667 --> 36:50.917
She never would've.

36:51.041 --> 36:52.000
'She was a big tennis star'

36:52.083 --> 36:53.125
'on the verge of going pro'

36:53.208 --> 36:56.667
and you were
just this little...fan.

36:56.750 --> 36:58.291
I wasn't just some fan.

36:58.375 --> 37:00.875
I put Andi Simmons on the map!

37:07.291 --> 37:09.959
I know you called
her
that night.

37:10.041 --> 37:10.959
Wrong.

37:11.041 --> 37:12.458
And that you came to her room.

37:12.542 --> 37:14.500
No, I didn't.

37:23.542 --> 37:26.000
'Well, that's the paper
that ran after she won.'

37:26.083 --> 37:28.291
Didn't hit campus
till the next day.

37:28.375 --> 37:31.000
How else did it get
in her room that night

37:31.083 --> 37:33.000
underneath
her dead body?

37:35.375 --> 37:37.166
"Sport."

37:41.834 --> 37:44.291
I just came to show her..

37:45.166 --> 37:47.166
...what I did for her.

37:47.250 --> 37:49.166
And she wasn't even grateful.

37:49.250 --> 37:52.125
No, she wasn't.

38:00.542 --> 38:02.542
Eric.

38:02.625 --> 38:04.458
Is someone here?

38:04.542 --> 38:06.125
No. Why?

38:06.208 --> 38:08.625
Well, I just didn't
wanna interrupt.

38:08.709 --> 38:09.875
It's pretty late.

38:09.959 --> 38:11.375
Yeah, but this can't wait.

38:11.458 --> 38:13.166
Here, go ahead, read it.

38:16.208 --> 38:18.875
You're the story.
The superstar.

38:18.959 --> 38:20.667
You know, Eric, that
word
is really starting

38:20.750 --> 38:23.000
to creep me out.

38:23.083 --> 38:26.041
I'm the...one
who named you that.

38:26.125 --> 38:28.959
It caught on, and everyone
calls you that now.

38:29.041 --> 38:30.834
But I was the first one.

38:34.417 --> 38:35.709
Anyway..

38:35.792 --> 38:38.166
I was the first one to see it.

38:40.000 --> 38:42.166
And I see something else.

38:42.250 --> 38:43.750
What's that?

38:43.834 --> 38:44.959
I see..

38:45.041 --> 38:48.041
...how great
we could be together.

38:48.125 --> 38:50.166
We?

38:52.917 --> 38:55.041
Eric!

38:55.125 --> 38:56.834
This is what you want.

38:56.917 --> 38:58.750
How do you know?
You don't even know me!

38:58.834 --> 39:00.959
I don't know you?
I write about you every day.

39:01.041 --> 39:01.917
So?

39:02.000 --> 39:03.083
Andi, geez, I'm the reason

39:03.166 --> 39:04.166
you're in the paper!

39:04.250 --> 39:05.542
No, you're not!

39:05.625 --> 39:08.083
It's me, not we.

39:08.166 --> 39:09.291
It's my life

39:09.375 --> 39:11.125
and I don't need
people telling me

39:11.208 --> 39:12.792
what I want.

39:13.667 --> 39:15.583
Boy, this has gone to your head.

39:15.667 --> 39:17.291
You should leave.

39:20.834 --> 39:22.417
You've gotten really stuck up.

39:22.500 --> 39:23.583
I'm the one who made you here.

39:23.667 --> 39:25.875
You might show some gratitude.

39:25.959 --> 39:27.333
You're not even grateful.

39:29.333 --> 39:33.000
Take your paper and go.

39:33.083 --> 39:35.208
And stop calling
me
and hanging up.

39:36.333 --> 39:38.458
I know it's you.

39:42.083 --> 39:43.667
It's really pathetic.

39:59.291 --> 40:00.583
I'm the one who made you!

40:00.667 --> 40:02.792
- Eric!
- You hear me, Andi!

40:02.875 --> 40:05.041
I made you!

43:42.834 --> 43:44.000
