00:07.467 --> 00:10.233
NARRATOR: On this episode
of Life Below Zero,

00:10.267 --> 00:12.600
Alaska braces
for the coming storm.

00:15.767 --> 00:17.733
GLENN: It snapped!

00:17.767 --> 00:21.233
NARRATOR: Andy's on the hunt
for an elusive food source.

00:21.267 --> 00:24.267
Might be turning into
starving country for Kate
and I this winter.

00:24.300 --> 00:27.033
NARRATOR: A painful injury
comes back to haunt Sue.

00:27.067 --> 00:30.967
SUE: I got a lot of scar
tissue that's preventing
me from walking well.

00:31.000 --> 00:34.367
NARRATOR: Glenn struggles
with last-minute repairs.

00:34.400 --> 00:38.067
GLENN: It's just at the limit
of what my body weight
will lift.

00:38.100 --> 00:41.733
NARRATOR: And the Hailstones
put it all on the line for
their next meal.

00:42.833 --> 00:44.067
AGNES: Aye Dee!

01:05.767 --> 01:06.767
(PANTING)

01:08.467 --> 01:11.167
I got a lot of scar
tissue that's preventing
me from walking well,

01:11.200 --> 01:14.967
so I'll have to go to town
to have the paws worked on,

01:15.067 --> 01:17.700
but I don't want
to go to town.

01:17.733 --> 01:20.333
I've got to depend
on somebody else.

01:20.367 --> 01:22.167
I'm depending on a pilot
to get me there,

01:22.200 --> 01:23.700
I'm depending on the doctor
to do his thing.

01:23.733 --> 01:26.533
I'm depending on taxi cab
drivers to take me around.

01:27.700 --> 01:29.067
For a control freak,

01:32.400 --> 01:35.733
it is really an exercise
in coming to the grips

01:35.767 --> 01:38.400
that I really have no control.
That's an illusion.

01:38.433 --> 01:42.367
NARRATOR: Kavik River Camp
is surrounded by the
predators of the tundra.

01:42.400 --> 01:45.167
An injury can
be a lethal liability.

01:45.200 --> 01:47.233
There's a wolverine
over there.

01:47.267 --> 01:49.633
SUE: You know,
predators are opportunists.

01:49.667 --> 01:51.533
I am a lone individual.

01:51.567 --> 01:53.167
I do walk with a limp.

01:53.200 --> 01:56.333
So that says, "Oh,
there's a pork chop."

01:56.367 --> 02:00.633
NARRATOR: Tomorrow, Sue will
travel to Fairbanks
for a foot procedure.

02:00.667 --> 02:04.767
Making sure camp is protected
from winter threats
is a top priority.

02:06.467 --> 02:12.067
As mundane as it is,
a visual on each trailer
that says,

02:12.067 --> 02:15.733
the windows are shut,
the doors are shut,
the wires are up,

02:15.767 --> 02:20.633
the buildings are sealed,
it's pretty serious.

02:20.667 --> 02:22.667
While I'm gone, who is
watching the camp?

02:22.700 --> 02:24.533
Is it gonna burn down?

02:24.567 --> 02:26.100
Are animals going
to get into it?

02:26.133 --> 02:27.700
All of that is preying on me.

02:32.333 --> 02:35.733
There's always a million
and one chores,
but I'm under the gun.

02:35.767 --> 02:39.067
So, before I leave,
I've got to get this
finished.

02:43.733 --> 02:45.667
And my electrical system is
hanging here.

02:53.400 --> 02:54.400
(STRAINING)

02:56.067 --> 02:57.300
I mean,
it's just kind of ironic,

02:57.333 --> 03:00.433
I'm going to town to have more
work on the paws now.

03:00.467 --> 03:04.500
But, I have to try
and secure my line

03:04.533 --> 03:07.467
so it doesn't yank my whole
electrical system down.

03:12.567 --> 03:17.167
The way that I busted up
the feet and legs the
last time,

03:17.200 --> 03:20.700
used to have a little bit
different electrical system
out here,

03:20.733 --> 03:24.933
so, I had to stack barrels and
I've done it a million times

03:24.967 --> 03:26.433
but a million and one
was too much.

03:26.467 --> 03:28.567
Something shifted
and I came down.

03:30.367 --> 03:36.967
When I came down, I landed
from 22 feet just like this
and then went over,

03:37.067 --> 03:38.867
busted three bones in
this leg and foot,

03:38.900 --> 03:42.733
and fractured some in that
one, and crushed all my
soft tissues.

03:42.767 --> 03:46.500
If I can't protect myself
and other people, I can't be
the warden of Kavik.

03:47.667 --> 03:48.767
Simple as that.

03:53.700 --> 03:57.133
ANDY: This is what Alaska was
built on, that pioneer spirit,

03:57.167 --> 04:01.067
that subsistence way of
living, that traditional way
of living.

04:03.267 --> 04:05.767
It's slowly going away.

04:05.800 --> 04:08.333
Not too many people want to
live this lifestyle any more.

04:19.467 --> 04:22.267
Transition from summer to
fall time means moose

04:22.300 --> 04:24.667
and right now
I'm really thinking

04:24.700 --> 04:27.700
I need to get some red
meat in the freezer.

04:30.100 --> 04:33.900
Come on, Jack! Good boy.
Yeah, that's a good boy!

04:33.933 --> 04:37.133
NARRATOR: For Andy and Kate,
moose hunting provides
a limited window to

04:37.167 --> 04:41.800
stockpile red meat and
protein before the freeze
when resources become scarce.

04:50.433 --> 04:54.067
ANDY: We only have about
a 10-day window to hunt
moose here.

04:54.067 --> 04:57.633
We go from summer to
winter really quick, our fall
is only about a week

04:57.667 --> 05:01.200
and a half long and it's time
for me to go out and try
and find some meat.

05:01.233 --> 05:05.267
To do that around here means
scouting, glassing,

05:05.300 --> 05:08.333
as much country as
I possibly can at one time.

05:09.767 --> 05:12.633
And for me that means
climbing up Calico Bluff.

05:20.633 --> 05:22.533
Let's go, boy. (WHISTLES)

05:22.567 --> 05:25.067
We burn a lot of calories
here, it gets damn cold.

05:25.100 --> 05:29.233
Without fat in your diet,
you don't do real well
out in this country,

05:29.267 --> 05:32.133
so a nice fat moose is pretty
important right now.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.467
Come here, buddy.

05:34.500 --> 05:39.067
This looks like a good place.
We're gonna go look
for moose here, huh?

05:39.067 --> 05:40.767
We'll see,
only time will tell.

05:45.667 --> 05:49.333
I'm just gonna start up river
and just keep working
my way down river.

05:49.367 --> 05:52.967
Bull moose are usually really
dark and black looking.

05:53.067 --> 05:56.267
Cow mooses are usually a
little bit silvery.

05:57.767 --> 06:01.300
Young cows tend to be more
of a reddish colour.

06:01.333 --> 06:05.367
So I'm basically looking for
changes in colour.

06:05.800 --> 06:07.467
Holy shit.

06:07.500 --> 06:11.267
Looks like a cow and two calf
moose swimming across
the lake right now.

06:11.300 --> 06:16.067
I can't harvest them,
I wouldn't want to harvest
them, but that's a good sign

06:16.067 --> 06:17.733
that there are moose
in the area.

06:17.767 --> 06:19.700
She's gonna be putting
scent out.

06:19.733 --> 06:23.267
That's certainly going to
attract other bull moose in.

06:23.300 --> 06:26.133
I know where they
took off from here

06:26.167 --> 06:30.667
and that's also another good
place to keep an eye out
for a bull moose.

06:35.200 --> 06:37.867
There's a lot of hunters
going by.

06:37.900 --> 06:42.200
Every time they come by like
that, any moose that was
thinking about walking out

06:42.233 --> 06:44.100
isn't going to walk out
anymore.

06:45.200 --> 06:46.733
Pretty frustrating.

06:46.767 --> 06:49.433
Little disappointed I haven't
spotted more animals.

06:50.333 --> 06:52.933
I'm glassing quite a bit
of country here

06:52.967 --> 06:57.767
and I guess it just goes
to show that it's a pretty
hungry country out here.

07:00.100 --> 07:03.533
CHIP: You gotta get out there
and earn it, but the fact
is, it's all out here.

07:03.567 --> 07:06.067
So, you get out here, you
find the way to get it,

07:06.067 --> 07:08.067
and you make a living
that way.

07:08.100 --> 07:11.200
It makes you wake up in the
morning and go, "Wow, what's
this day gonna be like?"

07:27.067 --> 07:28.733
-Hi, Dad.
-What's up, Pie?

07:28.767 --> 07:30.200
What you doing?

07:30.233 --> 07:32.667
I'm gonna make niksiks
out of these for me, you,

07:32.700 --> 07:35.067
your mom, Mary, whoever else.

07:35.067 --> 07:38.433
And I'm gonna make gorges
out of these bigger antler
pieces here.

07:38.467 --> 07:40.700
I'm getting' antlers.
I'm gonna make some jiggers,

07:40.733 --> 07:44.233
we call them niksiks
around here and I'm gonna
make gorges,

07:44.267 --> 07:47.067
which are a type
of traditional kind of hook.

07:47.067 --> 07:52.867
And I'm gonna go set them
down here on the river for
what we call tiktaalik.

07:52.900 --> 07:55.800
They're a large burbot.
They're a, kind of like
a lingcod.

07:55.833 --> 07:57.400
I'll show you how to make
tiktaalik traps

07:57.433 --> 07:59.800
so we're not stuck
with just whitefish.

07:59.833 --> 08:02.300
So get parked and then go
in the arts and crafts room.

08:02.333 --> 08:03.500
Okay.

08:03.533 --> 08:05.600
My parents aren't gonna be
here throughout my whole life,

08:05.633 --> 08:09.633
so as they teach me now,
it's best I learn and pay
attention,

08:09.667 --> 08:11.500
and get hands on experience.

08:11.533 --> 08:16.467
And I could teach my younger
sisters or my kids or anybody
that's willing to learn.

08:24.400 --> 08:25.767
See this slight groove in
the middle?

08:25.800 --> 08:28.333
If you make it a steep
groove that can snap it
in half.

08:28.367 --> 08:32.067
So, you make gentle groove
and then the string will
hold onto that and, like,

08:32.067 --> 08:37.067
let's say this is a piece
of meat, instead of being
like a hook in the meat,

08:37.100 --> 08:39.067
we'll slide this
into the meat.

08:39.067 --> 08:42.667
The fish will, with their big
mouths as tiktaalik, will come
up and they'll swallow it.

08:42.700 --> 08:44.533
And then when they try to
go, this will turn.

08:44.567 --> 08:46.600
This will come out of
the meat and it'll turn
in their stomach.

08:46.633 --> 08:48.700
-Oh.
-And it'll hold them
there.

08:48.733 --> 08:52.900
What we need to do is make
20 more and we'll go set
tiktaalik lines tonight

08:52.933 --> 08:55.067
and maybe we'll do a little
bit of jigging ourselves.

08:55.067 --> 08:56.200
All right.

08:58.567 --> 09:01.933
What I want my
daughter to do is know how to
fall back on the materials

09:01.967 --> 09:05.533
around her to keep her
life, what I consider,
above survival.

09:05.567 --> 09:08.067
Survival is we're making this
because we have
to eat tonight,

09:08.067 --> 09:09.400
I want my daughter to live.

09:09.433 --> 09:11.200
I want her to know how to plan
ahead to make these things.

09:11.233 --> 09:13.933
I want her to know what season
to be thinking about making
these stuff

09:13.967 --> 09:16.067
and I want her to know what
materials to use them on.

09:16.100 --> 09:18.167
Because it's not only
using materials, it's
knowing when to be there,

09:18.200 --> 09:19.933
what you're targeting
and how to get it.

09:19.967 --> 09:23.100
It's an education for her that
she's not gonna find
anywhere else.

09:24.467 --> 09:26.500
CHIP: These are enough for
your sisters and me and you

09:26.533 --> 09:28.767
and your mom and the rest
of them we'll put into traps.

09:41.400 --> 09:42.400
(CHIP TALKING)

09:45.633 --> 09:48.500
NARRATOR: Tiktaalik fishing
is a native tradition that
Chip and Agnes

09:48.533 --> 09:50.867
will pass
on to their daughters.

09:50.900 --> 09:53.467
But a lesson on the river
while the ice is still thin

09:53.500 --> 09:55.467
could have dangerous
consequences.

10:05.267 --> 10:07.300
CHIP: Evukpuk,
this is our spot.

10:11.100 --> 10:14.933
If you ladies go freshen out
five holes at least,
one for each of us,

10:14.967 --> 10:18.233
I'll get some willows
over here, I'll make
some rods. Okay?

10:28.067 --> 10:29.667
(AGNES TALKING)

10:36.833 --> 10:38.000
CHIP: Well, I got the sticks.

10:40.167 --> 10:41.833
Well, what we have
here is bait.

10:41.867 --> 10:43.333
We have fishtails.

10:44.300 --> 10:48.267
Okay, so, take a gorge,
put it in,

10:49.833 --> 10:53.933
and you just flip it down
the deal there,

10:53.967 --> 10:57.467
and you can leave it
like this and then
Ting can jig.

10:57.500 --> 10:58.500
Okay.

11:02.067 --> 11:04.400
AGNES: Okay, girls,
let's go open up
some more holes.

11:04.433 --> 11:07.700
The more holes we open,
the sooner we
can start hooking.

11:09.200 --> 11:10.533
(SCREAMS) Aye Dee!

11:13.667 --> 11:14.667
AGNES: Shocking.

11:16.167 --> 11:18.067
CHIP: That was the ice
shifting below us.

11:18.067 --> 11:23.200
My wife said, "Aye Dee", which
is equivalent, the Eskimo
equivalent of, "Fuck this."

11:23.233 --> 11:26.133
No matter how comfortable
or how thick it is,

11:26.167 --> 11:29.467
when I hear the sound of
cracking it just freaks
me out.

11:29.500 --> 11:33.500
NARRATOR: The Hailstones are
teaching their daughters
to fish for tiktaalik.

11:33.533 --> 11:36.500
But working on thin ice
is not without danger.

11:40.933 --> 11:43.133
AGNES: It's been 21
years and three weeks

11:43.167 --> 11:46.900
since my mother went out
fishing her last time.

11:46.933 --> 11:49.933
We ran two nets and me, my
dad, and my younger sister,

11:49.967 --> 11:53.900
we were just like five miles
away from each other.
And this old man,

11:53.933 --> 11:56.900
he comes cruising along
the edge and he's like,

11:56.933 --> 11:58.700
"Some people fell
through the ice

11:58.733 --> 12:01.633
"and I don't know who it is!"

12:01.667 --> 12:05.200
And I went back up to the
house and I say,
"Where's my mom?

12:05.233 --> 12:07.067
"Where's my brother?
Did they get back yet?"

12:07.100 --> 12:10.133
And he was like, "No they
never came back,
they're still out fishing."

12:10.167 --> 12:11.767
And right there I knew it.

12:16.133 --> 12:19.100
And my brother was right
under my mom.

12:19.133 --> 12:21.667
I don't fuck around when it
comes to ice.

12:21.700 --> 12:24.833
CHIP: It's spooky cos,
yeah, you're hearing the ice
basically drop.

12:24.867 --> 12:26.233
It's called settling.

12:26.267 --> 12:28.200
As there's less water being
introduced into the river,

12:28.233 --> 12:30.067
there's a lot less
supporting the ice.

12:30.067 --> 12:32.100
We're just basically dropping
the ice, that's all.

12:33.733 --> 12:35.167
It make my heart beat.

12:35.200 --> 12:36.800
It make your heart beat?

12:36.833 --> 12:38.467
Yeah, it make my heart beat.

12:38.500 --> 12:42.067
The ice right here is
about eight inches thick.
It's safe.

12:42.100 --> 12:44.067
AGNES: You can put
your jigger in.

12:50.133 --> 12:51.433
(AGNES SPEAKING)

12:51.467 --> 12:52.700
CHIP: You just wanna keep it
moving.

12:52.733 --> 12:54.800
AGNES: Iri, we'll go open up
yours next?

12:54.833 --> 12:56.067
IRIQTAQ: Yeah.

12:56.067 --> 12:57.800
As we get finished with
each hole, we'll go over

12:57.833 --> 12:59.700
and let a kid start
jigging there.

12:59.733 --> 13:01.733
This type of fishing
is ancient actually.

13:01.767 --> 13:03.800
Folks around here figured it
out years ago.

13:03.833 --> 13:06.267
So, if something became
a tradition, it probably
worked.

13:06.300 --> 13:08.067
And this is the essence of
subsistence.

13:11.667 --> 13:14.933
Usually at night the
tiktaalik are biting

13:14.967 --> 13:18.367
and so you tend to hook
more at night.

13:18.400 --> 13:23.333
Some nights we get a whole
bunch, some nights we don't,
every night is different.

13:30.133 --> 13:31.967
If you girls just be patient,

13:32.067 --> 13:37.200
I'll get one more hole in and
then we'll get these lines to
do the work for us.

13:37.233 --> 13:40.833
So, now that we have our
holes opened up and we've
been here a couple hours,

13:40.867 --> 13:45.333
we're cold, and
getting hungry, and we
haven't caught any fish.

13:45.367 --> 13:49.500
So, we're just gonna leave
our hooks down here
and call it a night.

13:51.167 --> 13:52.567
Don't be discouraged, girls,

13:52.600 --> 13:55.333
just cos we didn't get
nothing in the last hour.

13:55.367 --> 13:57.300
Sometimes you gotta wait
for the next school to come.

13:57.333 --> 14:01.200
But, when the next school
comes, our lines will be in
the water waiting for them.

14:03.267 --> 14:04.433
Okay, I put the last one in.

14:04.467 --> 14:06.400
We need to start
my snow machine.

14:08.700 --> 14:10.433
CHIP: I want them to be
comfortable out here.

14:10.467 --> 14:13.067
They know that they're walking
over food when they
walk on a river.

14:13.067 --> 14:15.400
I want them to know that
they've got things at hand

14:15.433 --> 14:17.500
that they can achieve
anything with.

14:17.533 --> 14:18.533
They can always win.

14:20.400 --> 14:22.767
SUE: I love being by myself.

14:22.800 --> 14:26.533
It doesn't mean that I'm
hiding from something
else that happened,

14:26.567 --> 14:30.067
it's just where my skin
fits my body.

14:42.567 --> 14:44.933
Just kind of a last
little chore.

14:44.967 --> 14:48.833
All of my trash needs to be
burnt down to its lowest ash,
if possible.

14:48.867 --> 14:52.867
NARRATOR: Tomorrow morning,
Sue will travel to Fairbanks
for her foot procedure.

14:52.900 --> 14:57.067
Before she can leave,
she must burn her waste
to keep predators away

14:57.067 --> 14:58.467
from camp in her absence.

14:59.767 --> 15:04.433
SUE: And this is my collective
garbage for several months.

15:05.700 --> 15:12.300
So, propane
gels at 40 below,
so I'm hoping it works.

15:12.333 --> 15:13.967
It's getting pretty cold.

15:14.067 --> 15:17.267
But, I got some paper.
I'll probably put a little bit
of jet fuel on it

15:17.300 --> 15:20.400
to give myself a little
extra boom power.

15:20.433 --> 15:23.300
But I'll go back
and burn garbage

15:23.333 --> 15:25.500
and that'll be the last of my
chores for today.

15:31.400 --> 15:35.467
The thought of actually having
to leave Kavik

15:35.500 --> 15:38.233
and be social again
is terrifying to me.

15:38.267 --> 15:40.833
Don't know how well
I can do it.

15:40.867 --> 15:43.600
Whether I like it or not,
people are going to be saying
hello to me

15:43.633 --> 15:45.067
and they're going to touch me.

15:45.100 --> 15:47.233
And that's a lot for me
to process.

15:52.667 --> 15:56.400
The object of this is to
just get it in, get it done,

15:56.433 --> 15:58.067
get it started pretty quick.

16:00.067 --> 16:03.767
It's a concern when
I'm burning the garbage,

16:03.800 --> 16:05.533
if it's a time
when the animals

16:05.567 --> 16:08.667
and the predators are awake
and roaming around.
As it's burning,

16:08.700 --> 16:11.333
of course it's gonna give off
the scent of burning food.

16:11.367 --> 16:14.500
There's not a lot of food
runnin' around on the
hoof out here

16:14.533 --> 16:16.867
and all predators
are opportunists.

16:16.900 --> 16:20.467
Right now, it's cold enough,
the bears have gone
back to bed.

16:20.500 --> 16:22.500
Haven't seen the wolves
in a couple of days,

16:22.533 --> 16:25.500
so I think it's a good
time to burn.

16:25.533 --> 16:28.833
Propane hopefully,
it is getting cold,

16:28.867 --> 16:30.333
but hopefully it'll light.

16:31.967 --> 16:33.333
Yay!

16:35.233 --> 16:37.900
You know when you leave
camp all alone,

16:37.933 --> 16:40.467
it is a total roll
of the dice.

16:40.500 --> 16:43.200
There's a million things
going through your head.

16:43.233 --> 16:47.133
I can leave
and try to achieve something,
but then I'm worried about

16:47.167 --> 16:49.100
what's happening
when I'm gone.

16:49.133 --> 16:51.600
And that's a lot for me
to process.

16:51.633 --> 16:54.867
So, time for me to get the
Bobcat put to bed,

16:54.900 --> 16:57.767
shut up shop, and get to town.

16:59.533 --> 17:01.967
GLENN: I don't have to go to
work and do a repetitive job.

17:02.067 --> 17:06.133
I do different jobs every day.
I'm not relying so much
on specialists

17:06.167 --> 17:08.233
as people have to do
in modern society,

17:08.267 --> 17:12.067
I get a lot more variety in my
life and that's what I like
about it out here.

17:17.833 --> 17:20.067
NARRATOR: Two hundred miles
from the nearest town,

17:20.067 --> 17:23.600
Glenn Villeneuve is without
access to modern equipment.

17:24.933 --> 17:28.900
Any construction or repair in
camp must be done by hand,

17:28.933 --> 17:32.467
using only the resources
that surround him in the
Brooks Range.

17:49.367 --> 17:50.500
GLENN:
This place is out of level.

17:50.533 --> 17:53.067
It used to be perfect
when I built it.

17:53.100 --> 17:57.300
But the thing is over the
years, one corner has sunk
there a little bit.

17:57.333 --> 17:59.600
And now, I can't even set down
a piece of ammunition here

17:59.633 --> 18:01.967
without having it
roll off my table.

18:02.067 --> 18:06.133
NARRATOR: With each passing
season, the ground freezes
and thaws,

18:06.167 --> 18:07.933
causing the cabin to sink.

18:07.967 --> 18:11.133
Glenn must
fortify his home before
the harsh winter arrives.

18:12.400 --> 18:14.567
I can tell the whole
place has tipped this way.

18:16.267 --> 18:17.567
A little bit higher
on this side.

18:17.600 --> 18:20.300
This one here is lower
than it used to be.

18:20.333 --> 18:23.600
I need to lift up my cabin,
the question is, "How am
I gonna do it?"

18:23.633 --> 18:27.133
One way might be with a lever
and a fulcrum.

18:27.167 --> 18:30.167
This is my cabin, this is my
fulcrum, this is my lever.

18:30.200 --> 18:37.333
Now, this is one way you can
lift a heavy object with
a relatively low force.

18:37.367 --> 18:40.767
The length of the lever
increases my mechanical
advantage.

18:43.167 --> 18:46.067
I got the model, now I gotta
go make the real thing.

18:46.067 --> 18:49.933
This is a pole that I used
to hang things off of to
keep them same from bears.

18:49.967 --> 18:51.733
And, actually,
I don't need it anymore.

18:51.767 --> 18:53.600
I think I'll cut this down
right here.

19:15.200 --> 19:17.233
I got a lever, now I need
a fulcrum to test it.

19:34.467 --> 19:36.200
It lifted it.

19:36.233 --> 19:38.467
Of course now
I got the problem,

19:38.500 --> 19:42.333
how am I gonna hold it up
and work on things?

19:44.467 --> 19:45.467
It snapped!

19:47.067 --> 19:49.700
That pole wasn't quite
strong enough.

19:49.733 --> 19:54.433
It might be faster,
and simpler,
and more efficient

19:54.467 --> 20:00.100
if I just had something
I could shove in there to hold
it up that high

20:00.133 --> 20:02.067
while I work,
reposition the rock.

20:08.800 --> 20:13.400
This... This one here is
the longest, I'll try this.

20:15.767 --> 20:20.000
I cut this tree more than
a decade ago in order to make
a teepee pole for a teepee

20:20.033 --> 20:22.233
I first had set up
at this camp.

20:22.267 --> 20:24.567
Then over time it became
part of my meat rack.

20:24.600 --> 20:27.533
Today, I'm gonna use it
here to try and jack
my cabin up.

20:30.067 --> 20:34.200
Now, if this one snaps,
as long as no part of my
body is under it, I'm safe.

20:36.433 --> 20:37.567
It broke again.

20:38.467 --> 20:40.100
That sucks.

20:40.133 --> 20:42.100
Because as that gets shorter,

20:43.100 --> 20:44.767
it gets harder to lift.

20:54.733 --> 21:01.300
Oh, I'll tell ya, it's just
at the limit of what my
body weight will lift.

21:07.467 --> 21:10.400
I want it higher, I can't
get the pole under.

21:12.133 --> 21:13.367
Let's try that.

21:14.700 --> 21:15.600
Yes!

21:15.633 --> 21:18.200
Look at that.
It's holding it up.

21:18.233 --> 21:20.300
Now I'm gonna reposition
this rock

21:24.300 --> 21:26.267
to about this area.

21:26.300 --> 21:28.433
I just have to prepare
the ground.

21:34.400 --> 21:37.433
I used my judgement in
terms of the height
of the rock,

21:37.467 --> 21:40.867
I have to lift it up
one more time,
pull this pole out,

21:40.900 --> 21:44.733
which is holding the cabin up
right now, lower it back down

21:44.767 --> 21:46.100
and hopefully it'll be level.

21:55.467 --> 21:58.233
So with just my saw
and my axe,

21:58.267 --> 22:01.100
and some spruce poles
I got right here
in my yard,

22:01.133 --> 22:02.833
I was able to jack this up.

22:02.867 --> 22:04.767
I got it done in no time.

22:04.800 --> 22:07.300
It would've taken me just as
long to do this if I was
in town using modern tools.

22:13.300 --> 22:15.400
I got a snowstorm
blowing in right here.

22:15.433 --> 22:17.300
I got this done just in time.

22:17.333 --> 22:18.733
I wanna go in and warm up.

22:26.333 --> 22:27.967
That's what I love about
living out here,

22:28.067 --> 22:30.267
is the unpredictability
and the excitement.

22:30.300 --> 22:32.200
This is interesting work.

22:32.233 --> 22:36.367
This is interesting work
because out here, one day
I can be moose hunting,

22:36.400 --> 22:40.167
another day I can picking
berries, and another day I
could be jacking' up my house.

22:41.600 --> 22:42.967
I find it a lot of fun.

22:43.067 --> 22:44.400
That's the way I like to
keep things out here,

22:44.433 --> 22:46.233
fun, interesting,
have a good time.

22:46.267 --> 22:48.600
Why else would you wanna be
living if you weren't having
a good time?

22:51.767 --> 22:54.267
ANDY: It takes a lot of
self-motivation to live
out in the bush.

22:54.300 --> 22:55.633
You gotta be able
to push yourself.

22:55.667 --> 22:57.300
You gotta get up
and get the job done.

22:57.333 --> 22:58.933
If you don't get it done,
then it's another whole year

22:58.967 --> 23:01.200
before you can get to that
project or you miss out.

23:12.600 --> 23:14.700
Just too much traffic on
the river right now.

23:14.733 --> 23:18.467
It's no sense in me calling
along the Yukon River

23:18.500 --> 23:20.233
just for someone else to
shoot the moose.

23:20.267 --> 23:25.733
So, just planning on heading
back to a lake back behind
our property.

23:25.767 --> 23:27.500
I'll look around
for some moose.

23:27.533 --> 23:31.067
Originally, I saw some cow
and calf moose back
on the lake,

23:31.100 --> 23:33.600
so I know there's something
living back there.

23:33.633 --> 23:35.800
So, I figure I'll go on back
and do some calling.

23:37.533 --> 23:39.267
NARRATOR:
With winter bearing down,

23:39.300 --> 23:41.800
Andy's time is limited to
hunt for moose,

23:41.833 --> 23:45.933
which could provide enough
red meat to last for the
entire year.

23:45.967 --> 23:48.933
ANDY: Back in these quiet
sloughs, the best way to
look for moose

23:48.967 --> 23:51.667
is intently listening to
hear any kind of twigs

23:51.700 --> 23:54.067
breaking or any movement
through the brush.

23:59.100 --> 24:00.500
(BRANCHES BREAKING)

24:05.367 --> 24:09.433
Another way you can get
a young bull in is to
imitate a call.

24:09.467 --> 24:13.733
The cows start calling cos
they want to attract a mate,
the bulls start calling,

24:13.767 --> 24:15.167
they wanna attract a mate,

24:15.200 --> 24:17.300
and all they're thinking
about is breeding.

24:17.333 --> 24:19.067
And that makes them
vulnerable.

24:19.067 --> 24:21.367
(IMITATES MOOSE CALL)

24:25.700 --> 24:27.800
And that's really
about the best chance
you have for getting

24:27.833 --> 24:32.667
them is trying to get them to
come to you as opposed to
you trying to get to them.

25:02.367 --> 25:03.367
(MOOSE GROANING)

25:20.467 --> 25:22.600
I think the toughest
thing about moose hunting

25:22.633 --> 25:26.067
is just the patiently
sitting quietly as you can.

25:26.100 --> 25:28.400
And there's no movement,
you generate no heat,

25:28.433 --> 25:30.133
so you get cold really quick.

25:30.167 --> 25:34.200
I'm not 20 years old anymore,
I gotta think about how
I do things

25:34.233 --> 25:36.767
and do them a little bit
different now than I used to.

25:54.500 --> 25:57.067
Probably 50% luck
and 50% skill,

25:57.100 --> 25:58.567
when it comes
to moose hunting.

25:58.600 --> 26:02.067
I tend to be the kind of
person that the luck...

26:02.067 --> 26:03.767
They just don't fall
into my lap,

26:03.800 --> 26:05.500
I tend to have to work
for them.

26:05.533 --> 26:08.600
So, I've learnt over the years
if you don't spend the time
out in the woods

26:08.633 --> 26:11.100
looking for them,
you're not gonna
get them.

26:13.067 --> 26:15.333
SUE: A little wind under your
wings and you got a lot
of freedom.

26:15.367 --> 26:16.833
And that's kind of how I feel
about my life,

26:16.867 --> 26:18.167
so it's a comfort zone.

26:29.233 --> 26:31.067
Hey, Dirk, you got a copy
on Kavik?

26:31.067 --> 26:32.233
Are you in range yet?

26:33.167 --> 26:37.433
(DIRK TALKING)

26:37.467 --> 26:39.933
All righty, and you should
be able to pull up.

26:39.967 --> 26:41.567
You'll wanna be a little
bit close.

26:41.600 --> 26:44.167
I've got the pump inside, but,
you know, I don't have
a lot of reach.

26:47.367 --> 26:49.133
Awesome, buddy, I sure
appreciate it.

26:51.933 --> 26:55.267
SUE: I think my window is
gonna be good enough to
let me go and come back,

26:55.300 --> 26:56.700
but it's a gamble.

26:56.733 --> 26:59.567
If you look at the whole scope
of my winter,

26:59.600 --> 27:01.700
this is not good travelling
weather.

27:01.733 --> 27:06.433
I've got one window,
one shot to get out, get it
done, and get back.

27:08.233 --> 27:09.933
You know, paws crossed,
that's all it is.

27:09.967 --> 27:12.267
NARRATOR: In order to keep
Kavik up and running,

27:12.300 --> 27:15.200
Sue must travel to Fairbanks
while the weather is clear

27:15.233 --> 27:18.200
to treat the painful scar
tissue in her feet and ankles.

27:20.333 --> 27:21.667
SUE: What a beautiful birdie.

27:31.133 --> 27:32.867
Hey, how are you doing?
Long time no see.

27:32.900 --> 27:34.433
-How are you doing?
-I'm doing all right.

27:34.467 --> 27:35.567
-Excellent.
-Thank you.

27:35.600 --> 27:37.433
Yeah, what a break
in the weather, huh?

27:37.467 --> 27:39.500
SUE: Don't know what the
weather's gonna bring.

27:39.533 --> 27:42.067
I do know that I gotta get
moving or I'm gonna lose
my window of opportunity.

27:43.800 --> 27:46.733
Al lright, time to go get
Ermie and get this show
on the road.

27:48.067 --> 27:49.567
This is the last of my bags.

27:53.133 --> 27:56.233
If I can't walk, and I
can't run, and I can't climb,

27:56.267 --> 27:58.767
I can't stay at Kavik.

27:58.800 --> 28:04.267
I can't do a lifestyle that's
important to me.

28:05.600 --> 28:07.433
Doesn't mean
I won't have life,

28:08.667 --> 28:10.767
it's gonna change
the game drastically.

28:15.833 --> 28:18.233
CHIP: I have all the material,
I have all the animals,

28:19.133 --> 28:20.267
I have all the information,

28:20.300 --> 28:22.167
and I have the willpower
and a healthy body.

28:22.200 --> 28:23.633
So, for me,
this ain't survival.

28:25.800 --> 28:26.800
This is just living.

28:38.433 --> 28:41.367
NARRATOR: The Hailstones have
set their traps for tiktaalik

28:41.400 --> 28:44.133
and will pull them from
the ice today in hopes
of enjoying

28:44.167 --> 28:46.567
the seasonal delicacy
before the fish migrate.

28:47.467 --> 28:49.333
-You got your
fishing stuff?
-Yep.

28:49.367 --> 28:52.200
Well, hopefully, we've had
some luck.

28:53.467 --> 28:54.767
AGNES: Okay then,
you girls ready?

28:54.800 --> 28:56.867
IRIQTAQ: Yeah. We're ready.

28:56.900 --> 28:59.067
We'll go see if we get
some fresh fish for dinner.

28:59.067 --> 29:01.667
Yep, sure wouldn't mind
some fresh tiktaalik.

29:05.700 --> 29:06.767
AGNES: Yeehaw!

29:24.067 --> 29:26.733
CHIP: Yesterday we came out
here and I knocked out
five holes.

29:26.767 --> 29:29.267
And when jigging is over,
and you're tired, especially
for tiktaalik,

29:29.300 --> 29:31.167
because you don't know when
the school will go by.

29:31.200 --> 29:33.067
What you end doing is just
leaving them behind.

29:34.433 --> 29:37.067
This froze at least
a couple inches
since last night.

29:43.100 --> 29:44.567
I don't think we got much
on this one.

29:44.600 --> 29:45.667
AGNES: Ah, man!

29:45.700 --> 29:46.833
CHIP: Uh, clean it out.

29:46.867 --> 29:48.800
AGNES: Scoop it out and then
we'll put it back in.

29:48.833 --> 29:51.533
Having the girls come
along with us and see
what we're doing,

29:51.567 --> 29:53.633
it prepares them for when
they're married

29:53.667 --> 29:55.433
and have their own families
and stuff.

29:55.467 --> 29:56.600
-CHIP: First one, Ting.
-That's mine.

29:56.633 --> 29:58.133
AGNES: It has two.
Go ahead, bun.

29:59.467 --> 30:01.200
AGNES: Aw.
CHIP: Ah!

30:03.533 --> 30:04.967
AGNES: Ah!

30:05.000 --> 30:06.633
CHIP: Clear your hole and
put them back.

30:08.033 --> 30:10.067
It is kind of like Christmas.

30:10.100 --> 30:13.533
It's one of those things,
you never know what you'll
get, you can't predict it.

30:14.633 --> 30:15.700
Oh!

30:18.167 --> 30:19.500
-(CHEERING)
-CHIP: Check that one out!

30:19.533 --> 30:20.867
AGNES: Oh!
Look, Dad's got one!

30:20.900 --> 30:22.067
Right on.

30:23.033 --> 30:24.767
But you see what
happened to him?

30:24.800 --> 30:26.667
This is what killed him,
he got greedy.

30:26.700 --> 30:29.133
Look at that big chunk
of fish in his belly.

30:29.167 --> 30:31.500
And then he's got one of those
in him sideways,

30:31.533 --> 30:33.267
so it popped his organs.

30:33.300 --> 30:34.733
The gorge more then
did its job.

30:34.767 --> 30:36.867
The gorge not
only caught the fish,
it killed the fish.

30:36.900 --> 30:40.233
So, it did a really good job
and it also kept the fish
from tugging the line

30:40.267 --> 30:41.767
and maybe freeing himself by
killing him.

30:43.300 --> 30:44.533
This is where you were
fishing, huh?

30:44.567 --> 30:45.433
IRIQTAQ: Yeah.

30:45.467 --> 30:47.400
Give it a jerk, pull out
your bait.

30:48.500 --> 30:49.833
IRIQTAQ: Oh, oh, oh!

30:49.867 --> 30:51.000
Oh!

30:51.033 --> 30:53.033
AGNES: Woo! Yay!

30:53.067 --> 30:55.433
CHIP: Wow!

30:55.467 --> 30:59.133
AGNES: I think we have
enough for dinner with
two nukchuks.

30:59.167 --> 31:00.567
It's really cool,

31:00.600 --> 31:02.233
I learnt something new,
and I learnt how to make
something,

31:02.267 --> 31:03.933
and I learnt how to
make it work.

31:03.967 --> 31:05.367
So that was even better.

31:05.400 --> 31:08.100
And I actually caught a
tiktaalik and it was something

31:08.133 --> 31:10.667
I didn't think was gonna
happen but it did.

31:12.833 --> 31:14.967
I'm gonna put these back
in and since it's so windy,

31:15.067 --> 31:16.467
Agnes, I want to go home.

31:16.500 --> 31:18.433
-I'm not gonna sit
out in this.
-AGNES: It's cold!

31:18.467 --> 31:19.667
It is nasty.

31:19.700 --> 31:21.733
Unfortunately, it's really
windy right now

31:21.767 --> 31:23.233
and it's gonna give us
frostbite

31:23.267 --> 31:24.933
and it's gonna be
miserable out here
pretty soon.

31:24.967 --> 31:27.400
So, I put the lines back with
the girls and then we're gonna
head home.

31:29.367 --> 31:32.067
AGNES: Two fish ain't bad.
Two fish is real good.

31:32.100 --> 31:33.333
Not bad for gorging, huh?

31:33.367 --> 31:34.867
Now you know how to make
your own fish hook.

31:34.900 --> 31:37.067
Yep, and I did catch my
own fish.

31:37.067 --> 31:38.100
Well, let's go eat them, huh?

31:38.133 --> 31:39.633
AGNES: Yep, let's go eat them.

31:39.667 --> 31:42.367
That's probably one of
the quickest fishing
trips I've ever been on.

31:42.400 --> 31:43.367
(LAUGHING)

31:43.400 --> 31:44.900
AGNES: It's a lot of fun.

31:44.933 --> 31:46.100
(ENGINE STARTING)

31:50.433 --> 31:53.367
Everything kind of has
a jigsaw puzzle effect
in this world.

31:53.400 --> 31:56.167
Like earlier this year,
we went up and got caribou.

31:56.200 --> 31:59.700
I took a bit of that caribou
antler and then we took a tail
off of a whitefish

31:59.733 --> 32:01.633
that we've been catching in
our whitefish net.

32:04.533 --> 32:06.933
And we put the gorge inside
the whitefish tail

32:06.967 --> 32:09.333
and then we went and caught
ourselves a whole
different meal.

32:09.367 --> 32:11.100
AGNES: Whoo!
CHIP: Wow!

32:11.133 --> 32:13.800
So everything has little
interlocking ways of
different uses

32:13.833 --> 32:16.267
and stuff and it all comes
together to make
a good living,

32:16.300 --> 32:19.433
and make a good dinner,
and make a good place out
here for us.

32:24.600 --> 32:27.467
ANDY: It's all about looking
at your situation, adapting,

32:27.500 --> 32:30.867
doing things as
efficiently and as
economically as you can.

32:30.900 --> 32:33.600
That's what life out here
is all about, if you're
gonna do it well.

32:50.967 --> 32:55.733
So it's about 6:00 a.m.
and it's time to go out
and look for moose.

32:59.767 --> 33:02.367
Generally I like to try
and get a pretty early start

33:02.400 --> 33:04.333
when I'm out hunting
for moose in the morning.

33:04.367 --> 33:06.367
They're a lot more active
in the morning.

33:06.400 --> 33:11.267
Also, there's a little less
pressure from other people out
on the river to compete with.

33:11.300 --> 33:13.267
A lot of people wait until
it's light.

33:13.300 --> 33:16.733
So I'm gonna try and take
advantage of some of these
early morning hours,

33:16.767 --> 33:18.600
do some floating,
do some glassing,

33:18.633 --> 33:21.267
and head back to where there
were some pretty good signs

33:21.300 --> 33:23.433
for moose
and see if I get lucky.

33:37.900 --> 33:39.467
I'm kinda in the area
right now,

33:39.500 --> 33:44.300
where we spotted a moose
a few days ago.

33:46.367 --> 33:49.367
So I'm gonna try and just
float through this area
kind of quietly.

33:53.967 --> 34:00.533
Pretty tough to float silently
when some other asshole comes
by at full speed.

34:02.133 --> 34:03.567
Gets pretty frustrating.

34:04.900 --> 34:07.433
You know, we're noticing
an increase in people
coming out

34:07.467 --> 34:12.900
and hunting in the area and
everybody has a right to go
hunt where they want,

34:12.933 --> 34:18.733
but it definitely is changing
and impacting the way
we're living anyway.

34:18.767 --> 34:21.600
That's history, doesn't
matter where you go in
the world,

34:23.200 --> 34:25.133
that's the way it always
seems to go.

34:25.167 --> 34:28.633
People move in,
the resources get depleted
or commercialized

34:28.667 --> 34:34.133
and they go away and then
everybody is fighting for
that one dollar.

34:52.200 --> 34:55.500
(WHISPERING) Some smaller,
older moose tracks right here.

34:55.533 --> 34:57.433
At least three
or four days old.

34:57.467 --> 35:00.967
A lot of older tracks
but nothing really fresh
right now.

35:01.067 --> 35:05.667
They are quite a few days old
with all the leaves in them.

35:05.700 --> 35:08.733
And you can see,
you know, they're just
kind of flattened out.

35:08.767 --> 35:13.133
So, I think I'm just gonna
move on out of here
as quietly as I can

35:13.167 --> 35:15.067
and then come back.

35:15.067 --> 35:17.167
This isn't lookin' real
productive today.

35:19.633 --> 35:22.600
SUE: You know, change comes
when the pain of
remaining the same

35:23.500 --> 35:26.933
is too great
than the fear of change.

35:26.967 --> 35:30.267
It's all out of my control.

35:50.333 --> 35:51.667
-I'll take her from here, Sue.
-All right.

35:51.700 --> 35:52.933
All right. Good luck to you.

35:52.967 --> 35:54.500
All right,
thank you, Dirk, I
appreciate it.

35:54.533 --> 35:56.633
-Yeah, you bet, good luck.
-All righty, bye-bye.

35:56.667 --> 36:00.700
SUE: I'll get my bags,
get in the taxi,
and get to the hotel.

36:00.733 --> 36:03.233
Feels like kind of a quick
send off on Ermie

36:03.267 --> 36:05.433
but I'll hook up
with her again.

36:10.133 --> 36:14.067
I am not somebody built
for speed and agility.

36:14.067 --> 36:15.833
I am somebody that has trained

36:15.867 --> 36:17.500
and worked themselves
for raw power.

36:17.533 --> 36:21.967
I've got a lot of power
in my legs and my feet
are the fulcrum.

36:22.067 --> 36:26.633
I'm gonna let them jam big,
ugly, nasty, painful
needles in my feet.

36:26.667 --> 36:28.200
And he's gonna inject stuff.

36:28.233 --> 36:31.133
He's gonna go through the
bottom of the foot,
into the joint.

36:31.167 --> 36:32.500
Squirty, squirty.

36:32.533 --> 36:34.867
Along that big tendon,
squirty, squirty, squirty.

36:34.900 --> 36:38.167
Along the ones on the top,
squirty, squirty, squirty.

36:38.200 --> 36:41.067
And not just one paw,
but both,

36:41.600 --> 36:43.067
because it is critical.

36:43.067 --> 36:44.467
Tomorrow's a big day.

36:45.767 --> 36:47.300
I gotta put the paws to bed.

36:58.867 --> 37:02.667
If I am willing to expend
this much cash, energy,

37:02.700 --> 37:07.600
time, and effort, then
yeah, I probably really
am feeling hurt,

37:07.633 --> 37:12.067
painful and less agile than
I need to be to survive up
where I'm at.

37:12.100 --> 37:14.367
But, it's what I've gotta do.

37:15.567 --> 37:17.700
DOCTOR: I'm going to do
the right one first.

37:19.967 --> 37:21.067
(SCREAMS) Ow!

37:21.067 --> 37:22.200
DOCTOR: Move it around
just a little bit.

37:23.767 --> 37:24.867
Almost done.

37:24.900 --> 37:26.067
(WHINCES)

37:26.067 --> 37:27.533
NURSE: Okay, switch sides.

37:28.267 --> 37:29.767
Get ready for a little poke.

37:29.800 --> 37:30.800
-(GASPS)
-Good job.

37:31.467 --> 37:32.567
(GASPS)

37:34.467 --> 37:36.167
DOCTOR: Little pressure there,
move it around.

37:36.200 --> 37:37.667
It's okay, it's all good.

37:37.700 --> 37:38.733
DOCTOR: Okay, that's it.

37:39.567 --> 37:41.167
SUE: That's it.

37:41.200 --> 37:43.300
The pain I'm
going through is
the inability

37:43.333 --> 37:45.067
of functionality of my feet

37:45.067 --> 37:48.800
is to the point
where I must do something
or accept defeat.

37:48.833 --> 37:51.733
I'm not accepting defeat,
no pun intended.

37:52.933 --> 37:54.533
All right, you are ready
to rock.

37:55.067 --> 37:56.233
SUE: Cool.

37:57.867 --> 37:59.900
Very simple procedure.

38:00.067 --> 38:02.833
Made me break down into,
you know, silly Sue.

38:02.867 --> 38:05.133
But, it's what I've gotta do.

38:15.600 --> 38:16.933
The paws are acceptable.

38:16.967 --> 38:19.500
They're hurting,
but they're good,
I can walk.

38:19.533 --> 38:22.700
I can get back to, you know...
Susie is an explorer,

38:22.733 --> 38:26.667
and I like to climb mountains,
and I like to see what's on
the other side.

38:26.700 --> 38:31.733
You have to be an active
participant in your own life.

38:31.767 --> 38:35.233
It's such a, maybe, a little
procedure that looks like
nothing.

38:35.267 --> 38:37.967
But it's not nothing to me.

38:38.067 --> 38:40.100
ANDY: There's one thing I'll
say about this country
out here,

38:40.133 --> 38:42.067
there's no guarantees
to anything.

38:42.067 --> 38:46.067
Sometimes things are
really good and sometimes
things are really bad.

38:46.067 --> 38:47.467
That's just the way it is
out here,

38:47.500 --> 38:50.367
sometimes you gotta bust
your butt to get
something done.

39:02.433 --> 39:05.633
(WHISPERS) I've been at this
now every morning,
every evening,

39:05.667 --> 39:09.933
and I'm just not seeing the
activity I normally do for
this time of year.

39:09.967 --> 39:12.967
Hunting is an awful lot
about patience.

39:13.067 --> 39:17.333
But your patience starts
to wear pretty thin

39:17.367 --> 39:20.467
and I think
I'm kind of aggravated

39:20.500 --> 39:22.333
by all the traffic
on the river.

39:24.367 --> 39:26.100
(SCRAPING)

39:33.567 --> 39:35.933
The sun is beginning to
burn through.

39:35.967 --> 39:39.633
When it's warm like this,
the moose just don't move
around as much.

39:39.667 --> 39:42.500
Usually it takes some cold
weather to really get them
in rut

39:42.533 --> 39:44.333
and get that mating
season going.

39:44.367 --> 39:46.967
And I'm just not seeing
a whole lot of sign.

39:47.067 --> 39:51.267
That moose is what I need
right now, but this just isn't
looking good.

39:52.500 --> 39:58.400
(SIGHS) Ah, man.
This is a waste of time, man.

39:58.433 --> 40:04.100
I think I'd be better off
spending time doin' other
things than, than this.

40:04.133 --> 40:05.633
I'll come back when it's cold.

40:25.833 --> 40:29.133
I just can't remember
when I spent this much
time hunting

40:30.133 --> 40:32.300
and come up with
a big goose egg.

40:33.933 --> 40:36.967
Most of the time it's
just not like that.

40:37.000 --> 40:41.167
Beginning to feel like
hungry country just got a
whole lot hungrier

40:41.200 --> 40:45.067
and might be turning into
starving country for Kate
and I this winter.

40:48.867 --> 40:51.300
I see no blood, no rack,
no nothing.

40:51.333 --> 40:53.100
ANDY: I'm pretty frustrated.

40:53.133 --> 40:56.700
I'm just gonna quit
hunting for a while until
the weather changes.

40:56.733 --> 40:59.333
When you're out hunting,
you got good feelings
and you get bad feelings.

40:59.367 --> 41:03.167
I go by my gut feelings a lot
of times and my gut feelings
have been telling me

41:03.200 --> 41:05.733
I'm kind of wasting my time
out here.

41:05.767 --> 41:10.933
It's just been too frustrating
with all the traffic around
here, and the weather,

41:10.967 --> 41:12.967
and just the lack of sign of
moose,

41:13.067 --> 41:15.433
so I have a long list of
projects I like to do.

41:15.467 --> 41:18.433
So, time to spend my time
doing something more
productive

41:18.467 --> 41:21.167
than sitting in the woods
swatting flies.

41:24.733 --> 41:26.400
CHIP: I want my kids to learn
how to use the materials

41:26.433 --> 41:28.733
from the land around them
to continue to make a life,

41:28.767 --> 41:30.300
to make a good living.

41:30.333 --> 41:32.967
Not just to scratch by
but to really
enjoy themselves

41:33.067 --> 41:34.367
and have themselves
a good life.

41:47.367 --> 41:48.733
AGNES: Do you girls
wanna watch it?

41:48.767 --> 41:49.800
I'm gonna cut the fish.

41:50.967 --> 41:52.267
Is the fish in there?

41:53.700 --> 41:55.233
Look girls, here's the hook.

41:55.967 --> 41:57.633
AGNES: I got it out.

41:57.667 --> 41:58.800
Holy crap.

41:58.833 --> 42:02.300
Look when, it's bloody,
when it ate it, it gets stuck.

42:03.567 --> 42:05.300
CHIP: Showed our kids
a good location.

42:05.333 --> 42:08.200
We showed them how
to make the gorges.

42:08.233 --> 42:10.433
And we showed them how
far to set them down.

42:10.467 --> 42:12.200
They've seen it, and then
they put their hands on it,

42:12.233 --> 42:13.633
and now I think
they've learnt it.

42:13.667 --> 42:15.333
And they won't forget it.

42:15.367 --> 42:17.267
I think this is the one
that Iri caught.

42:17.300 --> 42:19.267
It was in her trap.

42:19.300 --> 42:22.167
She's not here right now,
but she'll be here for dinner.

42:22.200 --> 42:26.433
This is a real nice, big one,
this is bigger than the last
one I just did.

42:26.967 --> 42:28.067
CHIP: Say hello.

42:28.067 --> 42:29.367
It's about to get noisy!

42:29.400 --> 42:31.133
CHIP: This is kind of like a
turkey at Thanksgiving.

42:31.167 --> 42:33.133
This is a taste of the
season, you know?

42:33.167 --> 42:34.333
It's fun to cook.

42:39.967 --> 42:41.067
Hey, kiddos!

42:41.067 --> 42:43.067
This tiktaalik looks done!

42:45.267 --> 42:46.700
Tiktaalik smells good, Dad.

42:47.967 --> 42:49.433
CHIP: This baby's fresh.

42:49.467 --> 42:51.333
Mmm, did you melt some
butter and stuff?

42:51.367 --> 42:52.800
I sure did, it's right
here on the table.

42:52.833 --> 42:54.067
Mmm.

42:55.767 --> 42:58.133
IRIQTAQ: Since I was a little
girl I used to always
cut up fish,

42:58.167 --> 43:02.767
or help my mom check the net,
or I just was born with fish
in my hands, I guess.

43:04.833 --> 43:07.267
CHIP: My kids are gonna learn
a lesson here that
the work pays off.

43:07.300 --> 43:10.067
The effort to go out there,
the effort to make the gorges,

43:10.067 --> 43:12.067
the effort to knock holes
in the ice,

43:12.067 --> 43:14.333
it's all worth it.

43:14.367 --> 43:16.567
They're gonna see,
cos they're gonna taste it.

43:17.733 --> 43:19.200
This is really good, Dad.

43:20.433 --> 43:21.533
CHIP: I'm glad you like it.
