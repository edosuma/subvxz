00:08.900 --> 00:11.670
Why don't we all have a party on Christmas Eve?

00:12.700 --> 00:13.950
That sounds like fun!

00:14.300 --> 00:18.500
Christmas means chicken and cakes, doesn't it?

00:19.080 --> 00:22.370
Sou, is there anything else you want to eat?

00:22.370 --> 00:23.960
Let me see...

00:23.960 --> 00:27.500
Christmas means salmon to me, I guess.

00:27.730 --> 00:28.630
Salmon?

00:29.570 --> 00:31.630
Why salmon for Christmas?

00:32.020 --> 00:34.010
There's nothing wrong with salmon.

00:34.010 --> 00:36.210

I don't really know a lot about Christmas,

was a man, was he not?

02:31.860 --> 02:32.880

03:57.870 --> 03:58.960
It does!

03:58.960 --> 04:02.760
You're so good at desserts and cooking, Mikakage!

04:03.260 --> 04:06.020
To me, sweets are an art,

04:06.020 --> 04:07.760

Nyanta's food is also good, though.

04:23.240 --> 04:26.980
I've been told that the attack on 
the goblins is going very well,

04:26.980 --> 04:28.830
but at earliest, not till after New Year's.

04:29.290 --> 04:31.580
They won't be back for Christmas, huh?

04:31.850 --> 04:34.580

I haven't seen Shiroe at all lately, either.

04:40.010 --> 04:41.700
Is he locked in his room again?

04:42.180 --> 04:43.110
He...

04:43.110 --> 04:47.990
Well, Shiroe isn't really the type 
that enjoys events like Christmas.

04:47.990 --> 04:50.720
And I'm sure there's a lot of work 
to do for the new year.

04:51.140 --> 04:52.790
You're right.

04:53.730 --> 04:55.980
It's really tough, isn't it?

04:59.260 --> 05:01.210

05:01.210 --> 05:02.310
Farewell.

05:03.960 --> 05:05.080

05:06.310 --> 05:08.730
Thanks for today.

05:10.400 --> 05:13.460
For dressing up like that with me...

05:13.720 --> 05:14.750
That was...

05:15.220 --> 05:17.460
They forced me to do it.

05:17.460 --> 05:21.200
But you come every day.

05:21.750 --> 05:24.470

May I ask a question?

06:16.740 --> 06:18.870
What happened to the katana that was here?

06:18.870 --> 06:19.810
We sold it.

06:20.590 --> 06:21.700
Really?

06:21.700 --> 06:22.820
Yeah, really.

06:23.450 --> 06:25.150
They very boldly paid in cash.

06:27.820 --> 06:29.950
Akatsuki seems like she's suffering.

06:30.380 --> 06:32.450
Does she seem that way to you, too?

06:32.840 --> 06:33.860
She does.

06:34.370 --> 06:38.420
Normally, she isn't the type to let her 
feelings show, so it's really obvious.

06:38.420 --> 06:39.460
I see...

06:39.770 --> 06:44.090
Akatsuki has been coming to observe the D.D.D. training sessions.

06:45.410 --> 06:48.340
I only noticed her there once...

06:48.340 --> 06:53.100
<b>5 Days Until Christmas</b>

06:48.780 --> 06:51.190
But it looks like she's been there many times.

06:51.740 --> 06:54.430
You know, we work hard to provide

06:54.430 --> 06:58.100
the best raiding environment in Akihabara.

06:58.940 --> 07:01.800
But it didn't seem like she wanted to join.

07:01.800 --> 07:03.630
I reported it to my lord,

07:03.630 --> 07:06.770
and he said to allow her to 
watch as much as she liked.

07:07.740 --> 07:09.860
I guess he owes Shiroe something.

07:10.370 --> 07:14.050
He said to help Akatsuki if anything came up.

07:14.620 --> 07:16.310
Is that so...

07:16.310 --> 07:20.620
It's possible she's observing other guilds, as well.

07:21.060 --> 07:25.630
Is she dissatisfied with her level or skills?

07:25.810 --> 07:28.620
It may be something even more basic.

07:29.580 --> 07:34.160
I think what Akatsuki wants is confidence.

07:35.620 --> 07:39.260
I suppose all we can do is to stay by her side.

07:39.670 --> 07:40.940

Recently, everything's been adventurer-style.

10:54.480 --> 10:58.730
Ah, I asked them to bring some things.

10:58.730 --> 11:00.300
So that was among them, eh?

11:00.700 --> 11:01.460
Huh?

11:02.040 --> 11:04.660
I don't know anything about adventurer clothes,

11:04.660 --> 11:06.830
so I wanted them to teach me.

11:08.100 --> 11:09.820
So that's it...

11:10.560 --> 11:14.020
But wearing clothes you aren't 
used to is kind of tiring.

11:14.460 --> 11:19.030

but you seem to be having a good time.

I'm glad you've made friends.

11:24.560 --> 11:26.660
They aren't my friends.

11:26.940 --> 11:30.010

you're having so much fun...

I'm sure you sometimes feel
uncertain or troubled, but...

11:33.960 --> 11:36.670

The etiquette I've learned doesn't work with them.

If you're having fun, you say you're having fun.

12:00.460 --> 12:04.530
Normally, I'm lazy, cowardly, and irresponsible.

12:04.800 --> 12:09.300

14:01.880 --> 14:06.770
Well, I understand that we're 
the right people to come to.

14:07.350 --> 14:10.110
We can work out a way to 
finance the research funds,

14:10.110 --> 14:12.620
where other, smaller guilds couldn't.

14:15.340 --> 14:17.120
I'm very grateful.

14:18.920 --> 14:21.780
It's none other than Shiroe's request.

14:21.780 --> 14:23.120
I'll do my best.

14:23.120 --> 14:25.880
I'm sure we'll need this research eventually.

14:27.710 --> 14:30.850
I'm counting on you.

14:32.970 --> 14:35.850
Chief Nyanta, do you have a moment?

14:35.850 --> 14:38.530
Perfect timing.

14:38.530 --> 14:40.980
I just came from the Roderic Merchant Guild.

14:41.520 --> 14:43.400
Thank you.

14:43.400 --> 14:45.740
I know I should've been the one to go.

14:46.010 --> 14:48.580
Don't worry about it.

14:48.580 --> 14:51.900
I got some tasty ramen out of the deal.

14:52.440 --> 14:54.240
How's everyone doing?

14:54.240 --> 14:57.030
The city's excited for Christmas,

14:57.030 --> 14:59.120
but nothing's really changed.

14:59.820 --> 15:01.500
It's that time already?

15:02.940 --> 15:05.390
Um... What about Akatsuki?

15:05.800 --> 15:10.260
She's visiting Princess Lenessia daily.

15:11.560 --> 15:12.580
All right.

15:13.110 --> 15:15.520
I'll contact you if there's anything else.

15:16.640 --> 15:18.100
What did the chief say?

15:18.720 --> 15:20.660
Nothing's really changed.

15:20.660 --> 15:24.320
Oh, but he said everyone's excited for Christmas.

15:25.800 --> 15:28.320
There's no way we'll get this 
done in time for Christmas.

15:48.450 --> 15:49.630
Enough!

15:50.930 --> 15:52.680
Ow...

15:52.960 --> 15:54.890
Thank you!

15:55.460 --> 15:58.360
You really are strong, Kyouko.

15:58.360 --> 16:00.230
I'm level 90, after all.

16:00.230 --> 16:02.490
Please tell us the secret to your strength!

16:03.610 --> 16:04.940
Akatsuki...

16:05.770 --> 16:07.320
This is nice!

16:07.320 --> 16:10.480
Let's take it to the palace.

16:10.480 --> 16:12.420
It'll brighten the place up.

16:12.420 --> 16:13.380
You're right.

16:13.380 --> 16:14.950
Sia will be so happy.

16:14.950 --> 16:19.520
You shouldn't call the princess "Sia," should you?

16:19.520 --> 16:22.440
She laughed and looked happy, so it's fine.

16:25.250 --> 16:27.280
Is that for Naotsugu?

16:28.050 --> 16:31.940
Um, well, when he gets back,

16:31.940 --> 16:34.970
I wanted to give him at least 
a little Christmas to enjoy...

16:34.970 --> 16:37.000
A maiden in love!

16:37.000 --> 16:39.600
I-It's not like that at all.

16:39.910 --> 16:41.250
What about you, Henrietta?

16:41.250 --> 16:43.750
Do you have anyone to give a present to?

16:43.750 --> 16:44.900
Me?

16:46.430 --> 16:47.870
I don't.

16:47.870 --> 16:49.070
Really?

16:49.070 --> 16:51.620
Come on... If you're going to buy it, buy it.

16:51.620 --> 16:53.220
Just wait a second.

16:54.430 --> 16:56.300
Excuse me!

16:59.950 --> 17:02.600
<i>An unrequited love, from a safe distance.</i>

17:03.050 --> 17:07.670
<i>This feeling is just a sweet ache I can live with.</i>

17:08.790 --> 17:12.170
<i>Of course there are wishes that can't come true.</i>

17:13.590 --> 17:16.550
<i>I've gotten used to that pain.</i>

17:21.070 --> 17:24.850
<i>Marie's bottomless cheer casts its 
glow on everyone around her.</i>

17:25.720 --> 17:28.860
<i>It may be her self-confidence.</i>

17:29.790 --> 17:31.520
<i>But Akatsuki...</i>

17:31.980 --> 17:33.860
<i>Akatsuki is so bright!</i>

17:34.530 --> 17:39.870
<i>She hasn't lost the easily injured vulnerability 
that grows numb as adulthood sets in.</i>

17:40.230 --> 17:43.110
<i>That vulnerability may be her weak point,</i>

17:43.110 --> 17:46.030
<i>but it's also a great treasure.</i>

17:46.860 --> 17:49.560
<i>Not that she's realized that.</i>

17:50.670 --> 17:53.880
<i>She's so precious, I just want to 
squeeze her tight right now!</i>

17:54.110 --> 17:55.930
Sorry to keep you waiting.

18:01.960 --> 18:05.550
Princess Lenessia, you look so cute and fluffy.

18:05.960 --> 18:06.990
Really?

18:07.300 --> 18:09.770
I chose it from her wardrobe.

18:11.070 --> 18:13.030
Well, let's go!

18:13.510 --> 18:16.040
Before we get that stew, let's look around town.

18:16.040 --> 18:19.700
I want Sia to learn more about Christmas.

18:20.010 --> 18:21.000
Right.

18:22.630 --> 18:24.830
Get too excited, and you'll trip.

18:29.020 --> 18:30.590
Ow...

18:30.920 --> 18:32.590
<i>The adventurers</i>

18:33.440 --> 18:37.090
<i>are so different from us, 
I don't understand them at all.</i>

18:37.830 --> 18:43.990
<i>Many People of the Land ask me various 
things about the adventurers,</i>

18:44.710 --> 18:46.600
<i>but I don't know, either.</i>

18:47.420 --> 18:50.130
<i>I deal with them every day,</i>

18:50.130 --> 18:52.050
<i>but the number of things I don't 
understand keeps rising.</i>

18:53.550 --> 18:56.110
<i>Even so, there's one thing I've learned.</i>

18:57.540 --> 18:59.890
<i>The adventurers are only adventurers.</i>

19:00.610 --> 19:02.490
<i>Even if I don't know the right answers,</i>

19:02.490 --> 19:04.460
<i>it's a mistake to lump them all into a group,</i>

19:04.460 --> 19:07.710
<i>and merely view them by their jobs or roles.</i>

19:08.540 --> 19:09.940
<i>Even I know that.</i>

19:11.280 --> 19:13.110
<i>The adventurers are jewels.</i>

19:13.700 --> 19:16.560
<i>Each one of them is different,</i>

19:16.560 --> 19:18.680
<i>and shines brightly.</i>

19:20.350 --> 19:22.420
<i>They're special.</i>

19:23.120 --> 19:25.500
<i>So I can't call myself their friend.</i>

19:30.470 --> 19:32.150
We're here.

19:32.150 --> 19:41.490
<b>Restaurant 
Milky Margaret</b>

19:32.430 --> 19:35.090
The stew here is fantastic!

19:35.090 --> 19:37.990
I heard it's super-duper good.

19:37.990 --> 19:39.690
Let's hurry inside!

19:39.690 --> 19:41.490
I'll be leaving you all here.

19:42.660 --> 19:43.780
What's wrong?

19:44.490 --> 19:46.540
I have something to do.

19:48.570 --> 19:49.860
All right.

19:50.310 --> 19:51.670
We'll take care of the rest.

19:54.170 --> 19:58.760
<b>Restaurant 
Milky Margaret</b>

19:56.210 --> 19:58.760
Is she going to watch someone train again?

19:59.010 --> 20:02.000
Akatsuki's suffering, too.

20:03.210 --> 20:06.010
She's like a dagger...

20:07.550 --> 20:09.970
She's like an obsidian dagger,

20:10.620 --> 20:12.260
strong and beautiful.

20:14.050 --> 20:17.780
<i>I know I can't get stronger simply 
by watching people train.</i>

20:18.640 --> 20:23.320
<i>I don't have the power needed to do anything...</i>

20:29.270 --> 20:31.540
I miss my lord.

20:35.240 --> 20:37.670
<i>I want to talk to him, just for a bit.</i>

20:37.670 --> 20:40.460
<i>To get close to him, to tug on his coat.</i>

20:40.460 --> 20:43.110
<i>To sit on the same sofa, and look out the window.</i>

20:43.110 --> 20:44.810
<i>To eat red bean buns.</i>

20:44.810 --> 20:46.700
<i>I want to be near him always.</i>

20:47.560 --> 20:49.570
<i>Even if I'm just in the background.</i>

20:50.770 --> 20:52.970
<i>But that's just me lying to myself.</i>

20:53.520 --> 20:56.560
<i>If I can't fly anymore, I can't be by my lord's side.</i>

21:01.450 --> 21:02.570
<i>Right now,</i>

21:03.570 --> 21:05.640
<i>I still can't be with him.</i>

21:08.460 --> 21:12.380
<i>I got three salted salmons at Shopping Street 8.</i>

21:12.700 --> 21:15.170
<i>I'm sure Sou will be happy!</i>

21:18.910 --> 21:20.360
Santa?

21:22.800 --> 21:24.800
<b>Embert Nelreth/ Samurai</b>

21:23.390 --> 21:24.800
No, it's not!

21:28.240 --> 21:29.870
<i>A PKer?</i>

21:29.870 --> 21:32.640
<i>But there's no fighting allowed inside towns!</i>

21:33.510 --> 21:36.150
The Royal Guard isn't coming.

21:39.420 --> 21:40.620
<i>It's okay.</i>

21:40.620 --> 21:44.150
<i>I'm the West Wind Brigade's 
second captain for a reason!</i>

21:44.710 --> 21:47.160
<i>There's no way I can lose!</i>

24:05.650 --> 24:09.900
When his dear friend is wounded, 
Soujirou's rage silently rises.

24:10.400 --> 24:13.050
Lenessia is forced to make an important decision.

24:13.050 --> 24:15.620
Akatsuki runs through the city, lost in thought.

24:15.990 --> 24:19.770
As the snow falls, the battle with 
the murderer finally begins.

24:20.030 --> 24:23.440
What secret of the Teachings does 
Soujirou share with Akatsuki?

24:23.860 --> 24:25.720
Next time: Christmas Eve.

24:23.860 --> 24:29.940
<b>Christmas Eve</b>

24:25.720 --> 24:27.620
Rise up once more.
