00:07.849 --> 00:10.918
Richwood:
You know, after six months,

00:11.479 --> 00:14.155
Mars is starting to remind me
of Kauai,

00:14.189 --> 00:16.586
except without the water

00:16.606 --> 00:21.128
or the hot girls in bikinis
or the air.

00:22.232 --> 00:25.381
What I wouldn't give
for a hot girl.

00:25.629 --> 00:29.236
Hell, after all this time,
I'd even take an ugly one,

00:29.270 --> 00:31.805
assuming she came
with a paper bag.

00:31.840 --> 00:34.074
Kim: Oh, real classy, Richwood.

00:34.109 --> 00:35.743
Just repair the short,

00:35.777 --> 00:38.011
and make sure the four-b coil
isn't fried.

00:38.045 --> 00:40.847
We can't afford to have
the power grid compromised.

00:40.881 --> 00:42.749
Aye-aye, captain.

00:45.482 --> 00:47.020
Oh, boy.

00:47.054 --> 00:50.257
Bad news. It's charred.

00:50.818 --> 00:53.660
I may have to replace
the power coupling

00:53.694 --> 00:56.495
and [Distorted] reboot
a-level systems...

00:56.530 --> 00:57.864
[Static]

00:57.898 --> 00:59.799
Didn't read that, Richwood.
Interference.

00:59.833 --> 01:01.034
Come again.

01:01.068 --> 01:02.301
Watch out!

01:02.335 --> 01:03.703
Aaaaah!

01:03.737 --> 01:05.384
Tom?

01:06.306 --> 01:08.007
Tom!

01:12.011 --> 01:13.445
[Zapping]

01:15.000 --> 01:21.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:22.322 --> 01:23.622
[Laughs]

01:23.657 --> 01:25.524
Oh!

01:25.559 --> 01:28.967
- [Chuckles] Yes!
- I can't wait to take off my...

01:29.929 --> 01:30.862
shoes.

01:30.897 --> 01:31.976
Dad. Beckett.

01:31.996 --> 01:33.999
So much for a quiet evening
at home.

01:34.033 --> 01:36.018
I thought you guys
were working late tonight.

01:36.038 --> 01:37.523
Slow murder day.
We got off early.

01:37.543 --> 01:39.462
You're playing laser tag?

01:39.482 --> 01:41.028
Without me?

01:41.048 --> 01:42.907
Is that my gear?

01:42.941 --> 01:44.909
Oh, dad, Beckett, this is David.

01:44.943 --> 01:46.977
He bet me I couldn't beat him.

01:47.012 --> 01:48.879
[Door closes]
She trounced you, didn't she?

01:48.914 --> 01:50.398
- Yeah.
- Martha: Oh, my,

01:50.418 --> 01:52.508
what is going on down here?

01:52.528 --> 01:53.655
[Laughs]

01:53.675 --> 01:57.021
Far too much, apparently.
Uh, are those my pajamas?

01:57.055 --> 01:58.756
Uh... Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[Cellphone chimes]

01:58.790 --> 02:01.204
I'm so sorry, Ben.
Um, family, Benjamin.

02:01.224 --> 02:02.792
Ben, meet my family.

02:02.812 --> 02:04.592
Castle, we got a murder.

02:06.898 --> 02:09.032
Uh, to solve, not to commit.

02:10.150 --> 02:11.193
Bye.

02:11.213 --> 02:12.967
But those were
my softest pajamas,

02:12.987 --> 02:14.772
and now I'm gonna have
to burn them.

02:14.807 --> 02:15.840
Is it just me, or is the loft

02:15.874 --> 02:17.607
getting awfully small
these days?

02:17.642 --> 02:19.543
Well, four adults together
in one space...

02:19.577 --> 02:21.712
we're bound to step
on each other's toes.

02:21.746 --> 02:23.981
Yeah, well, there's a lot more
toes than usual tonight.

02:24.015 --> 02:25.615
Hey, guys. Glad you're here.

02:25.650 --> 02:28.450
You're gonna want to see this,
especially you, Castle.

02:35.560 --> 02:37.160
What is this place?

02:37.194 --> 02:38.628
It's mission control.

02:41.165 --> 02:42.666
And that's Mars.

02:42.700 --> 02:44.501
And there's your body.

02:47.104 --> 02:48.804
Our victim is on Mars?

02:49.855 --> 02:51.407
The "secret manned mission
to Mars" rumors were true.

02:51.441 --> 02:52.575
I knew it!

02:52.609 --> 02:54.310
You know, this might be a little

02:54.345 --> 02:55.578
out of our jurisdiction.

02:55.612 --> 02:57.347
Esposito: It's not Mars.

02:57.381 --> 02:59.749
This is operations director
Ed Redley.

02:59.783 --> 03:01.251
- This is Detectives Beckett and Ryan.
- Castle.

03:01.285 --> 03:03.486
Redley: Uh, what you're seeing
is a live feed

03:03.520 --> 03:04.587
from a simulation
we're conducting

03:04.621 --> 03:06.154
in advance of
a real Mars mission.

03:06.189 --> 03:07.723
Who's "we"? NASA?

03:07.758 --> 03:10.259
It's the Mars 2018 project.
We're privately funded.

03:10.293 --> 03:13.262
Yes, by Viggo Jansen,
the Internet billionaire.

03:13.296 --> 03:15.751
He promised to put humans
on Mars by 2018.

03:15.771 --> 03:17.032
Held a competition
and everything.

03:17.066 --> 03:19.435
I signed up for the program,
but I didn't get in.

03:19.469 --> 03:20.836
Wait, you signed up
to go to Mars?

03:20.871 --> 03:22.604
- When?
- A couple years ago.

03:23.096 --> 03:24.949
Where was I?

03:24.969 --> 03:26.241
We were fighting.

03:26.276 --> 03:29.611
The victim, pilot Tom Richwood,
was supposedly alone

03:29.645 --> 03:33.515
on the, uh, planet's surface
conducting repairs.

03:33.549 --> 03:35.217
We were in a communication
blackout,

03:35.251 --> 03:36.684
part of simulating
planetary conditions,

03:36.719 --> 03:38.386
when the mission commander
broke protocol

03:38.421 --> 03:39.721
to tell us they found Tom dead.

03:39.755 --> 03:41.523
They don't think
it was an accident.

03:41.557 --> 03:43.925
Well, I'd like to see the body.
So where is the simulation?

03:43.959 --> 03:45.059
A couple of floors below us,

03:45.093 --> 03:46.528
and that's easier said
than done.

03:46.562 --> 03:48.129
In order to mimic conditions
on Mars

03:48.163 --> 03:49.697
as well as discourage
any cheating,

03:49.732 --> 03:51.599
the simulation is filled
with noxious gas.

03:51.634 --> 03:53.134
Redley:
Right, it won't kill you,

03:53.168 --> 03:55.369
but it will induce severe nausea
and a rash.

03:55.404 --> 03:57.419
It would take several days
to vent the sim

03:57.439 --> 03:59.640
to make the air breathable,
so if you want to go in,

03:59.674 --> 04:01.934
you're gonna need to wear
space suits.

04:03.745 --> 04:05.712
Best case ever!

04:05.747 --> 04:07.452
[Chuckles]
This way?

04:11.075 --> 04:13.286
What can you tell us
about the victim?

04:13.321 --> 04:15.489
Well, Tom Richwood
was the mission pilot.

04:15.523 --> 04:17.491
Former Navy top gun,
did a tour with NASA.

04:17.524 --> 04:18.459
What about family?

04:18.493 --> 04:20.594
None, which made him
the perfect candidate

04:20.628 --> 04:21.394
for the mission.

04:21.428 --> 04:22.921
He beat out
some of the smartest,

04:22.941 --> 04:24.765
most competitive candidates
in the world

04:24.799 --> 04:26.800
to be a part of the first
manned team to Mars.

04:26.835 --> 04:28.634
- They all did.
- Who else is inside?

04:28.669 --> 04:30.470
Our four remaining astronauts.

04:30.504 --> 04:34.740
The team's medical specialist,
Dr. Haroun, is waiting for you.

04:34.775 --> 04:35.875
[Beep]

04:37.111 --> 04:39.980
So, has anyone been in or out
of the simulation recently?

04:40.014 --> 04:42.515
No. It's a sealed
nine-month experiment.

04:42.549 --> 04:43.483
No one's been in or out

04:43.517 --> 04:45.685
since the astronauts entered
six months ago.

04:45.719 --> 04:47.325
Which means one of them
probably did it.

04:47.345 --> 04:48.754
Yeah. [Chuckles]

04:50.724 --> 04:52.358
There's only three suits.

04:52.392 --> 04:54.861
Um, that's okay.
We don't all need to go in.

04:54.895 --> 04:56.662
I'll go take statements back
at the facility.

04:56.682 --> 04:57.811
Seriously?

04:57.831 --> 04:59.465
You don't want to go to Mars?

04:59.500 --> 05:02.034
"A," it's actually not Mars,

05:02.068 --> 05:03.869
and "b,"
I'm happy here on earth,

05:03.903 --> 05:05.807
but have fun, Castle.

05:07.207 --> 05:09.475
Castle: Trust me, I will.

05:09.509 --> 05:13.845
[Richard Strauss'
"Also sprach Zarathustra" plays]

05:29.529 --> 05:30.795
Are you done?

05:30.830 --> 05:31.796
No.

05:31.831 --> 05:33.621
Finally made it to Mars.

05:33.641 --> 05:35.403
I didn't even have to go
to astronaut training.

05:35.423 --> 05:37.083
So, you really signed up
to go to Mars, huh?

05:37.103 --> 05:38.036
Wouldn't that be cool?

05:38.070 --> 05:39.370
I mean, not so much for you,
but for me.

05:39.404 --> 05:40.404
Uh-huh.

05:40.439 --> 05:41.439
Detectives?

05:41.473 --> 05:43.507
I'm Dr. Rusham Haroun,
the bioscience officer.

05:43.542 --> 05:45.216
He's over here.

05:46.271 --> 05:48.079
And nobody saw this happen?

05:48.114 --> 05:50.281
No, we were all in the module.

05:50.315 --> 05:52.013
We heard him scream.

05:52.187 --> 05:53.851
He must have fallen
into the coupling coil,

05:53.885 --> 05:55.919
because right then
the power went out.

05:55.954 --> 05:58.723
By the time Angela and I
got out here, he was gone.

05:58.757 --> 06:01.127
It took us another 10 minutes
to get the power restored.

06:01.147 --> 06:02.526
It looks like a stab wound.

06:02.561 --> 06:03.894
Delivered with a lot of force.

06:03.928 --> 06:06.177
- Well, where's the murder weapon?
- Haroun: There wasn't one.

06:06.197 --> 06:09.399
But one of his tools,
his screwdriver, is missing.

06:09.433 --> 06:11.073
It looks like this.

06:13.046 --> 06:15.205
It's pretty rocky around here.
No footprints.

06:15.240 --> 06:17.607
And, since the killer
was probably wearing a suit,

06:17.642 --> 06:19.392
there's not gonna be any DNA.

06:19.412 --> 06:21.444
Let's get his body to the morgue
and find out.

06:21.479 --> 06:24.080
And get csu down here.
I want this place searched.

06:24.114 --> 06:25.548
If no one's been in or out,

06:25.583 --> 06:28.318
then that murder weapon
is still inside here.

06:28.352 --> 06:31.288
Dr. Haroun, I'd like to speak to
the other astronauts, please.

06:31.322 --> 06:33.928
They're inside. Follow me.

06:34.275 --> 06:35.727
[Castle sighs]

06:36.025 --> 06:38.462
One small murder for man,

06:38.482 --> 06:40.729
one giant mystery for mankind.

06:40.764 --> 06:45.634
Even when you whisper,
everyone can hear you.

06:52.642 --> 06:54.977
Richwood: I may need to replace
the power coupling

06:55.012 --> 06:56.478
and [Distorted] reboot...

06:56.513 --> 06:57.579
[Static]

06:57.614 --> 06:59.515
Kim: Didn't read that, Richwood.
Interference.

06:59.549 --> 07:01.183
Come again.

07:01.217 --> 07:03.819
Richwood: Watch out! Aaaaah!

07:03.853 --> 07:05.754
You know the rest. [Sighs]

07:06.311 --> 07:08.996
And where were each one of you
when this happened?

07:09.016 --> 07:11.660
Angela, rusham, and I were here,
in the command module.

07:11.695 --> 07:13.628
Mikhail was over in engineering.

07:13.662 --> 07:15.797
And is there access to
the outside from engineering?

07:15.832 --> 07:17.665
[Russian accent]
There is emergency hatch,

07:17.700 --> 07:20.768
but if I had gone through it,
the alarm would have sounded.

07:20.803 --> 07:23.171
Plus, as part of the program,
we're all closely monitored.

07:23.206 --> 07:25.340
In case we lose consciousness

07:25.374 --> 07:27.442
or there's a suit malfunction
on an E.V.A.,

07:27.476 --> 07:29.176
we all have trackers
under our skin.

07:29.211 --> 07:31.909
And M.I.R.A. keeps a record
of all our movements.

07:32.748 --> 07:33.648
Who's M.I.R.A.?

07:33.682 --> 07:35.656
That's what we call
the mission computer.

07:35.676 --> 07:37.542
Well, I'd like to take a look
at those records.

07:37.562 --> 07:40.788
M.I.R.A.: I will be happy to provide
you with any records you require,

07:40.823 --> 07:41.789
Detective Beckett.

07:41.824 --> 07:43.558
- It talks?
- Yeah.

07:43.592 --> 07:45.792
We think of her as
the sixth member of the crew.

07:45.827 --> 07:48.695
Isn't that a little "2001"?

07:48.730 --> 07:51.031
She is programmed
to learn and adapt,

07:51.066 --> 07:53.200
but she's more Siri than H.A.L.

07:53.235 --> 07:55.135
Ask her where you are.

07:55.170 --> 07:56.670
M.I.R.A., where are we?

07:56.704 --> 07:59.840
You are aboard the vessel
tensing norgay

07:59.875 --> 08:01.675
in the northern lowlands
of Mars.

08:01.709 --> 08:03.891
She actually thinks
she's on Mars.

08:04.679 --> 08:06.847
Regardless, I'm gonna need
to ask all of you

08:06.881 --> 08:09.835
to join me at the precinct
so I can interview you properly.

08:12.019 --> 08:14.688
That... could be a problem.

08:14.722 --> 08:16.490
Redley: I'm sorry, detective.

08:16.524 --> 08:18.224
I can't let you
remove the astronauts.

08:18.259 --> 08:19.893
I don't have that kind
of authority.

08:19.927 --> 08:23.096
- Well, then, who does?
- Viggo: That would be me.

08:23.130 --> 08:26.266
And my astronauts
aren't going anywhere.

08:26.300 --> 08:28.307
That's Viggo Jansen.
The Viggo Jansen.

08:28.327 --> 08:30.491
Detective, if we shut down now,

08:30.511 --> 08:32.772
we will lose months
of priceless data.

08:32.806 --> 08:34.607
Millions of dollars' worth
of experiments

08:34.640 --> 08:35.741
will be compromised.

08:35.775 --> 08:38.176
We'll lose half a year,
and we don't have that time.

08:38.211 --> 08:40.578
Mr. Jansen, it's not a request.

08:40.614 --> 08:41.727
A man has been murdered.

08:41.748 --> 08:43.582
I need to conduct
an investigation.

08:43.616 --> 08:46.849
And I will do everything
in my power to help you...

08:47.023 --> 08:48.554
Short of shutting down my sim.

08:48.588 --> 08:53.025
Mars is our generation's
space race,

08:53.059 --> 08:55.210
and my team's gonna be first...

08:55.230 --> 08:57.595
not the Chinese or Mars one

08:57.630 --> 09:01.110
or that puffed-up
movie producer, Sir Ian Rasher.

09:01.582 --> 09:03.902
I can get a court order
to compel you.

09:03.937 --> 09:05.770
And with my legal team,
it'll take you months.

09:05.790 --> 09:08.213
Or we can work together.

09:08.233 --> 09:09.974
I give you all the access
you need,

09:10.008 --> 09:12.684
and my simulation keeps running.

09:13.491 --> 09:15.647
Fine. For now.

09:15.681 --> 09:18.616
But if I find out any of those
people are responsible,

09:18.651 --> 09:20.819
you won't stop me
from removing them.

09:20.853 --> 09:22.921
Yeah. Well, according
to this tracking data,

09:22.955 --> 09:24.288
none of them seem responsible.

09:24.323 --> 09:26.866
They were all exactly
where they said they were

09:26.886 --> 09:28.392
at Tom's approximate
time of death.

09:28.427 --> 09:30.828
It even confirms
that the mission's rover

09:30.862 --> 09:33.695
was still parked at the habitat
at the time of the incident.

09:33.715 --> 09:35.732
Well, there goes my
"rise of the machines" theory.

09:35.767 --> 09:37.734
Okay, so if all the people
inside are accounted for,

09:37.769 --> 09:40.438
then our killer must have come
from outside of the simulation.

09:40.472 --> 09:41.404
We would know.

09:41.439 --> 09:43.640
The airlock door is
the only way in or out.

09:43.675 --> 09:45.108
It's alarmed and monitored.

09:45.142 --> 09:46.944
Uh, excuse me.
Detective Beckett,

09:46.978 --> 09:48.745
there's a message coming in
for you from the habitat.

09:48.780 --> 09:50.313
I can put it on the monitor
if you like.

09:50.348 --> 09:51.815
Yeah, please.

09:53.485 --> 09:54.652
Hey, Espo, what do you got?

09:54.686 --> 09:55.719
I was just going through

09:55.754 --> 09:56.987
our victim's video diaries.

09:57.021 --> 09:58.621
There's something
you need to see.

09:59.824 --> 10:01.424
Six months in,

10:01.458 --> 10:05.829
and I know part of this mission
is a psych experiment.

10:05.863 --> 10:08.498
Maybe the close quarters
are starting to get to me,

10:08.532 --> 10:10.767
but I think I'm starting
to see things.

10:10.802 --> 10:14.970
When I was out there today,
I could've sworn I saw someone,

10:15.005 --> 10:18.308
and it's not the first time.

10:18.342 --> 10:23.813
I know it's not possible,
but I don't think we're alone.

10:26.799 --> 10:29.343
S07E16
The Wrong Stuff

10:29.363 --> 10:32.185
sync and corrected by ninh
www.addic7ed.com

10:33.327 --> 10:35.895
Esposito: Hang tight.
I may have more questions.

10:45.872 --> 10:48.607
[Keyboard clacking]

10:51.005 --> 10:52.009
Beckett: Go ahead, Espo.

10:52.043 --> 10:55.356
Hey. So, I just finished talking
to the other astronauts.

10:55.376 --> 10:56.647
None of them
seem to have any idea

10:56.667 --> 10:58.048
what Tom was talking about.

10:58.082 --> 11:00.184
All right. Thanks, Espo.

11:00.218 --> 11:02.219
Csu just finished
their initial sweep.

11:02.254 --> 11:04.054
There's no one else
in that simulation.

11:04.088 --> 11:06.589
It's possible
Tom was seeing things.

11:06.624 --> 11:08.424
All our tests show
that being locked

11:08.459 --> 11:09.592
in a confined space with others

11:09.627 --> 11:11.261
can play tricks on your mind.

11:11.295 --> 11:12.963
Only, delusions don't kill.

11:12.997 --> 11:14.698
And, if what Tom said was true,

11:14.732 --> 11:15.766
then whoever killed him

11:15.800 --> 11:17.901
might have been able to get in
and out undetected.

11:17.935 --> 11:19.269
I told you, detective,

11:19.303 --> 11:22.038
given our security,
that's impossible.

11:22.072 --> 11:23.545
Redley: Sir.

11:23.769 --> 11:25.542
Maybe not.

11:25.576 --> 11:27.277
At Detective Ryan's request,

11:27.311 --> 11:29.245
I ran a check on all
our security systems.

11:29.280 --> 11:31.414
Everything looked normal
until I got into the deep code.

11:31.448 --> 11:33.216
See that?

11:33.250 --> 11:35.051
- Oh, God.
- What is it?

11:35.085 --> 11:36.819
Our security system's
been hacked...

11:36.853 --> 11:38.654
key cards, alarm codes.

11:38.689 --> 11:41.223
Meaning someone could've broken
into the simulation.

11:41.257 --> 11:42.526
Based on our back-up files,

11:42.546 --> 11:44.060
these changes were made
two days ago,

11:44.094 --> 11:47.797
sometime between 11:10
and 11:14 at night.

11:52.996 --> 11:56.624
Digital tracing indicates we
were breached from the outside.

11:56.644 --> 11:58.404
Someone broke through
our firewall.

11:58.424 --> 11:59.274
Can you tell who?

11:59.309 --> 12:01.109
We log every I.P. address

12:01.143 --> 12:02.678
that connects to the mainframe.

12:02.712 --> 12:04.914
I'm running a trace now
for that time window.

12:06.254 --> 12:08.899
There. Third one down.
I don't recognize that one.

12:08.919 --> 12:10.319
All right, we should
be able to trace it.

12:10.353 --> 12:11.485
Don't bother. I just did.

12:11.520 --> 12:15.990
It's coming from a residential
wi-fi registered to a...

12:16.025 --> 12:17.784
You got to be kidding me.

12:17.804 --> 12:19.469
Who is it?

12:19.643 --> 12:21.676
Clint Granger, hothead pilot.

12:21.696 --> 12:23.131
He was one of our applicants

12:23.165 --> 12:24.565
until he was kicked out
of the program.

12:24.599 --> 12:25.800
Why'd he get kicked out?

12:25.834 --> 12:27.668
He accused Tom of sabotaging him

12:27.702 --> 12:29.303
during candidate testing

12:29.337 --> 12:30.805
and claimed it cost him
the pilot spot.

12:30.839 --> 12:32.673
So he tried to run Tom over
in the parking lot.

12:32.707 --> 12:34.475
And when was this?

12:34.509 --> 12:36.243
Seven months ago.

12:36.277 --> 12:38.831
But he did say he'd be back
to finish the job.

12:39.785 --> 12:41.415
Clint: Yeah, I was pissed.

12:41.450 --> 12:42.583
I'm still pissed.

12:42.617 --> 12:44.898
He slipped something into my
drink before the final round.

12:44.918 --> 12:46.820
Slowed my reaction time.

12:46.854 --> 12:49.089
So you tried to run him over
with your car?

12:49.123 --> 12:51.558
It should have been me
on that mission, not him.

12:51.592 --> 12:53.641
He stole my spot in history.

12:54.634 --> 12:58.165
And you ask me,
he got what he deserved.

12:58.199 --> 13:00.033
But I did not kill him.

13:00.068 --> 13:02.836
And yet we traced that
cyber attack to your apartment.

13:02.870 --> 13:05.371
I am a pilot,
not a computer geek.

13:05.405 --> 13:08.040
I couldn't rewrite that code
if the mission depended on it.

13:08.075 --> 13:09.442
You could've hired someone.

13:09.477 --> 13:11.410
Yeah, but I didn't.

13:11.445 --> 13:13.412
Look, when Tom was getting
himself murdered,

13:13.447 --> 13:15.214
I was at dinner with a friend
in Connecticut.

13:15.248 --> 13:17.350
And when that hack took place
from my wi-fi,

13:17.384 --> 13:18.717
I wasn't even in the country.

13:18.751 --> 13:20.662
Someone's setting me up!

13:24.491 --> 13:26.558
Granger's alibi checks out.

13:26.593 --> 13:29.595
He was at dinner with a friend
when Tom Richwood was killed.

13:29.629 --> 13:31.230
What about the night
the hack took place?

13:31.264 --> 13:33.299
Granger was visiting his brother
in Nova Scotia.

13:33.333 --> 13:34.366
It wasn't him.

13:34.400 --> 13:35.300
Mars, Nova Scotia...

13:35.334 --> 13:37.469
this guy really loves
barren landscapes.

13:37.504 --> 13:38.537
Come on, Ryan,

13:38.571 --> 13:40.639
you're telling me you have
no desire to go to Mars?

13:40.673 --> 13:42.608
I prefer my oxygen
without a can.

13:42.642 --> 13:43.709
Where's your sense of adventure?

13:43.743 --> 13:44.776
Of exploration?

13:44.811 --> 13:47.278
Of... destiny?

13:47.313 --> 13:50.248
If I want to fly thousands
of miles to see a lifeless orb,

13:50.282 --> 13:52.283
I can just visit
Jenny's grandmother.

13:52.318 --> 13:56.154
Same hostile environment,
same freezing temperatures,

13:56.188 --> 13:58.656
same noxious atmosphere.

13:58.690 --> 13:59.824
Huh.

13:59.858 --> 14:01.792
Huh? "Huh," what?

14:01.827 --> 14:04.095
Well, this is a video of
Granger's apartment lobby

14:04.130 --> 14:06.297
the night of the hack...
check it out.

14:06.332 --> 14:08.332
This guy enters the building
at 11:05 p.m.,

14:08.366 --> 14:09.834
just before the hack took place.

14:09.868 --> 14:11.468
Now watch.

14:13.005 --> 14:15.439
15 minutes later.

14:19.310 --> 14:20.999
He leaves the building.

14:21.296 --> 14:23.580
He could've piggybacked
on Granger's wireless

14:23.614 --> 14:25.349
and used that
to carry out the attack

14:25.383 --> 14:27.223
on the simulation security.

14:27.596 --> 14:30.587
Yeah, but who is he?

14:30.621 --> 14:32.423
Esposito: Name's George Reyes.

14:32.457 --> 14:34.925
The folks down at Mars 2018
recognized him immediately.

14:34.959 --> 14:36.593
He's the senior facilities
engineer,

14:36.627 --> 14:37.461
and he called in sick yesterday.

14:37.495 --> 14:38.962
Nobody's been able
to reach him since.

14:38.996 --> 14:40.764
Did he have a motive to break

14:40.798 --> 14:42.087
into the simulation
and kill Tom?

14:42.107 --> 14:43.824
Not that anyone knew,
but his colleagues say

14:43.844 --> 14:45.910
that he's been acting secretive
the last couple of days,

14:45.930 --> 14:48.271
ever since receiving a private
communique from his wife.

14:48.305 --> 14:50.139
What does his wife
got to do with this?

14:50.174 --> 14:52.108
Maybe everything.
Ask me who his wife is.

14:52.142 --> 14:53.543
- Who's his wife?
- Angela Olvera,

14:53.578 --> 14:55.679
one of the other astronauts.

14:56.547 --> 14:58.347
So, what was on the message?

14:59.738 --> 15:03.186
I was letting George know that
I wanted out of our marriage.

15:03.220 --> 15:04.813
You broke up with him
from space?

15:04.833 --> 15:07.490
He was sending me
all these sweet e-mails.

15:07.524 --> 15:09.441
I couldn't let it go on.

15:09.461 --> 15:12.361
I had to tell him that
I'd fallen for someone else,

15:12.396 --> 15:14.396
someone on the mission.

15:14.430 --> 15:15.464
Was it Tom?

15:15.498 --> 15:17.666
No. Not Tom.

15:22.171 --> 15:23.672
Oh, God.

15:24.432 --> 15:26.021
What?

15:26.306 --> 15:27.676
Angela?

15:27.711 --> 15:30.119
I didn't say who it was
in my letter.

15:30.139 --> 15:32.166
Maybe he thought it was Tom.

15:32.186 --> 15:33.582
Did he have reason to?

15:33.616 --> 15:35.650
Yeah, he did.

15:35.684 --> 15:38.446
Tom wouldn't stop hitting on me
all through training.

15:38.466 --> 15:41.689
George told him if he didn't
stop, he'd make him pay.

15:43.292 --> 15:45.994
Yo. We found him.
He's at the airport.

15:46.028 --> 15:47.495
Just bought a ticket
to San Francisco.

15:47.529 --> 15:49.849
Airport security
just picked him up.

15:51.686 --> 15:54.736
We were a team, Angela and me.

15:54.770 --> 15:57.183
We were gonna go to Mars
together or not at all.

15:57.203 --> 15:59.090
But when she got in
and I didn't,

15:59.110 --> 16:00.407
I couldn't stand in her way.

16:00.442 --> 16:02.726
Hard enough to have
her leave the planet,

16:02.746 --> 16:05.012
but to leave you
for someone else...

16:05.046 --> 16:06.746
you must have been devastated.

16:07.106 --> 16:09.016
Try utterly destroyed.

16:10.284 --> 16:12.186
Is that why you hacked security?

16:12.220 --> 16:13.687
In order to break
into the simulation

16:13.721 --> 16:16.223
and kill the man that you
thought was Angela's lover?

16:16.258 --> 16:19.070
I'm telling you, I had nothing
to do with Tom's death.

16:20.546 --> 16:23.496
I was going
to sabotage the mission.

16:24.572 --> 16:27.165
I figured if the simulation
suffered a catastrophic failure,

16:27.185 --> 16:28.769
it would set the program back,

16:28.803 --> 16:30.537
and Angela would come home
to me.

16:30.571 --> 16:32.939
But I chickened out.

16:32.974 --> 16:34.440
The hack,

16:34.475 --> 16:36.042
setting it up to lead back
to Granger...

16:36.076 --> 16:37.610
that's as far as I got.

16:37.645 --> 16:38.511
I never went inside,

16:38.546 --> 16:40.877
and I sure as hell
didn't kill anyone.

16:41.848 --> 16:43.716
Then why were you leaving town?

16:43.750 --> 16:45.918
She dumped me.

16:45.952 --> 16:48.721
How was I supposed to keep
going to work there?

16:48.755 --> 16:50.723
I needed a fresh start.

16:51.383 --> 16:52.758
And since I got her letter,

16:52.793 --> 16:56.628
I've spent nights drowning
my sorrows at O'Malley's.

16:56.663 --> 16:58.931
That's where I was
when Tom was murdered.

16:58.965 --> 17:00.638
- You can ask them.
- Okay, Ben.

17:00.658 --> 17:03.367
So who else
could've used your hack

17:03.387 --> 17:04.769
to get through
the simulation's airlock?

17:04.789 --> 17:07.089
It was calibrated to my biometrics.
No one else could've used it.

17:07.109 --> 17:08.973
- But someone did.
- No.

17:09.008 --> 17:11.242
If they got in,
they did it some other way.

17:11.277 --> 17:12.678
There is no other way.

17:13.512 --> 17:15.400
I'm not so sure about that.

17:15.981 --> 17:18.750
- What do you mean?
- I studied the facility plans.

17:18.784 --> 17:21.118
The simulation is like
a bank vault.

17:21.153 --> 17:23.255
To get in,
you got to get past guards,

17:23.289 --> 17:25.022
security systems, cameras.

17:25.057 --> 17:27.290
But like a bank vault,

17:27.326 --> 17:29.610
if you're motivated enough,

17:29.746 --> 17:32.067
there's always another way in.

17:39.371 --> 17:40.671
You really think someone

17:40.706 --> 17:42.973
could've tunneled their way
into the sim?

17:43.007 --> 17:45.643
No, but since George's alibi
checked out,

17:45.677 --> 17:47.678
we're gonna have to look
at all of our options,

17:47.713 --> 17:51.148
including the unlikely ones.

17:52.551 --> 17:54.552
According to George's map,

17:54.586 --> 17:56.954
this abandoned utility access

17:56.988 --> 18:00.057
runs directly
under Jansen's facility.

18:00.091 --> 18:01.959
Yeah, but who would hate
Tom enough

18:01.993 --> 18:04.494
to tunnel through 5 feet
of concrete to kill him?

18:04.528 --> 18:06.864
I don't know, but, uh...

18:08.510 --> 18:10.968
But it looks like someone did.

18:12.357 --> 18:13.847
Castle, boost me up.

18:13.867 --> 18:15.807
Why am I always on the bottom?

18:16.707 --> 18:18.575
Yes, dear.

18:18.609 --> 18:21.711
Planets [Sighs]
dank access ways...

18:21.746 --> 18:23.350
is it just me, or does this
remind you of "Alien"?

18:23.370 --> 18:25.782
I know that you want this
to be science-fiction,

18:25.802 --> 18:27.082
but we are not in space.

18:27.102 --> 18:28.718
No, but wouldn't you
like it to be?

18:28.753 --> 18:30.917
Come on, you're a Sci-Fi geek.

18:30.937 --> 18:33.237
- Wouldn't you just love to go to Mars?
- Of course I would.

18:33.257 --> 18:34.724
That's why I applied

18:34.758 --> 18:36.459
to Ian Rasher's
[Straining] program last year!

18:36.494 --> 18:38.928
Wait, what?
You applied to go to Mars?

18:38.962 --> 18:41.195
Without me? When?

18:41.215 --> 18:43.166
Well, we were fighting.

18:43.201 --> 18:44.967
Oh, okay. Well, I deserved that.

18:45.002 --> 18:46.269
Oh, geez, Castle.

18:46.304 --> 18:47.904
See anything?

18:50.140 --> 18:52.238
Someone did tunnel up.

18:53.678 --> 18:55.048
Castle?

18:55.068 --> 18:57.113
I think I found
the murder weapon.

18:57.147 --> 18:59.182
[Hissing] Did you hear that?

18:59.216 --> 19:01.017
Whoa. Hear what?

19:01.051 --> 19:02.665
[Hissing continues]

19:03.820 --> 19:05.588
Oh, whoa! Aah!

19:07.505 --> 19:09.105
What happened?

19:09.859 --> 19:11.360
Something's down here.

19:11.394 --> 19:13.355
Some thing?

19:18.235 --> 19:20.193
What the hell is that?

19:24.360 --> 19:25.794
Told you this felt like "Alien."

19:25.828 --> 19:27.896
Castle, stop.
This is not "Alien."

19:27.930 --> 19:29.398
Did that look human to you?

19:29.432 --> 19:30.665
Actually, no.

19:30.700 --> 19:32.367
Right.

19:32.402 --> 19:33.502
See, I'm betting
it's a xenomorph

19:33.536 --> 19:36.185
stranded here on earth,
attracted to the simulation

19:36.205 --> 19:37.906
because it needs
the toxic environment.

19:37.940 --> 19:39.974
It probably saw Tom as
encroaching on its territory

19:40.008 --> 19:42.577
- and killed him for it.
- What are you doing?

19:42.611 --> 19:44.044
I'm checking you for bites
and scratches.

19:44.079 --> 19:46.581
Making sure you didn't somehow
get impregnated.

19:46.615 --> 19:49.243
If you think that's how I get
pregnant, we need to talk.

19:50.919 --> 19:52.506
There!

19:58.301 --> 19:59.778
Beckett!

20:03.826 --> 20:05.933
It shed its skin.

20:07.375 --> 20:08.732
It's not skin.

20:08.752 --> 20:09.937
It's a gas mask.

20:09.971 --> 20:14.073
It's a breathing hose.
For a human.

20:14.108 --> 20:16.776
To protect themselves from
the fumes of the simulation.

20:16.810 --> 20:19.366
Someone was trying to break in.

20:20.814 --> 20:21.681
[Whirring]

20:22.344 --> 20:24.431
Haroun: Yes, this was
the access point.

20:24.451 --> 20:26.976
Why would someone tunnel
into my simulation?

20:26.996 --> 20:28.379
Well, maybe it's one of
your competitors.

20:28.399 --> 20:30.703
It could be espionage...
Or sabotage.

20:30.723 --> 20:32.558
And our victim
might have found out

20:32.592 --> 20:33.925
and threatened to expose them.

20:33.960 --> 20:35.594
Either way,
this explains what he saw,

20:35.629 --> 20:38.096
why he thought there was someone
else in there with him.

20:38.131 --> 20:39.632
[Cellphone rings]
How did they elude my cameras?

20:39.666 --> 20:40.947
Well, maybe they were working
with someone

20:40.967 --> 20:42.301
that was involved
in your program

20:42.335 --> 20:44.203
and knew when the cameras
would be blacked out.

20:44.237 --> 20:45.704
Excuse me.

20:45.738 --> 20:47.247
- Beckett.
- Hey.

20:47.267 --> 20:48.606
So, CSU just confirmed it.

20:48.641 --> 20:50.742
The blood on the screwdriver
belonged to Tom.

20:50.777 --> 20:52.878
- It's our murder weapon.
- Okay, any prints?

20:52.912 --> 20:54.579
No, but if the killer
was in the simulation...

20:54.613 --> 20:56.648
Then they would have been
wearing gloves.

20:56.683 --> 20:58.216
Um, okay,
what about the gas mask?

20:58.250 --> 20:59.985
- Anything from that?
- It looks military,

21:00.019 --> 21:01.707
but we're still trying
to run it down.

21:01.727 --> 21:03.754
Meantime,
Ryan's pulling camera footage

21:03.789 --> 21:04.822
from the surrounding area.

21:04.856 --> 21:05.890
Maybe we'll get lucky,

21:05.924 --> 21:06.891
catch our alien exiting

21:06.925 --> 21:08.923
one of the access points
to the utility tunnel.

21:08.943 --> 21:10.363
Probably won't know anything
till morning.

21:10.383 --> 21:12.597
All right, keep me apprised.

21:13.937 --> 21:15.132
Okay, why don't you think
about anyone

21:15.167 --> 21:17.168
that would have wanted
to breach your simulation,

21:17.203 --> 21:18.635
and we'll keep you posted
on what we find.

21:18.670 --> 21:20.181
Yeah.

21:20.672 --> 21:23.048
[Sighing] Oh, my God.
What a day.

21:23.068 --> 21:25.609
I feel like I'm still covered
in spider webs.

21:25.644 --> 21:27.545
I cannot wait
to take a hot shower.

21:27.579 --> 21:30.437
Oh, maybe I could, uh, join you.

21:30.457 --> 21:31.649
Ooh, that'd be nice.

21:31.684 --> 21:33.685
We could relax,
have a glass of wine...

21:33.719 --> 21:35.019
[indistinct singing]

21:35.053 --> 21:36.720
Do you hear that?
[Muffled laughter]

21:36.754 --> 21:37.922
It's your mom.

21:37.956 --> 21:39.256
And Ben.

21:39.635 --> 21:41.859
And Alexis is here.

21:41.893 --> 21:43.794
With friends.

21:43.829 --> 21:44.661
Maybe we could go to a hotel.

21:44.696 --> 21:46.130
And yet you think
you could survive

21:46.164 --> 21:47.431
being stuck in a space capsule

21:47.465 --> 21:48.866
with four other people
for a year.

21:48.900 --> 21:50.467
I could, if you were
one of those people.

21:50.501 --> 21:51.901
Oh.

21:51.936 --> 21:54.070
[Both chuckle]

21:57.215 --> 21:59.242
Wow, you guys.

21:59.276 --> 22:00.877
Get a room.

22:00.911 --> 22:02.111
We would,
if there were any left!

22:02.146 --> 22:03.503
[Door closes]

22:06.150 --> 22:08.784
Maybe you shouldn't have been
so quick to sublet your place.

22:08.819 --> 22:10.986
You know, maybe we can just
set up a schedule,

22:11.020 --> 22:12.488
or they could give us a heads-up

22:12.522 --> 22:14.824
and let us know what to expect
when we get home.

22:14.858 --> 22:16.392
I'm gonna call a family meeting.

22:16.426 --> 22:17.993
Or we could just go to Mars.

22:18.027 --> 22:19.995
Yeah, I don't think
you'd be happy there.

22:20.029 --> 22:21.597
There's no showers,
there's instant coffee,

22:21.631 --> 22:22.965
and you have to bag your own...

22:22.999 --> 22:23.966
Hey, castles!

22:24.000 --> 22:26.435
Hey. Any luck on that
security-cam footage?

22:26.470 --> 22:27.903
Nada.
Your alien must've accessed

22:27.937 --> 22:29.738
the underground where there
wasn't any coverage.

22:29.772 --> 22:32.507
But we did have better luck
with that gas mask.

22:32.541 --> 22:35.277
CSU was able to pull
exhaled-breath condensate

22:35.311 --> 22:36.678
from inside the face plate.

22:36.712 --> 22:38.747
It contained trace amounts
of DNA.

22:38.781 --> 22:39.982
We get a match in the system?

22:40.016 --> 22:41.516
Not our system,

22:41.550 --> 22:43.475
but as part of
the Mars 2018 program,

22:43.495 --> 22:46.540
every applicant
had to submit sample DNA.

22:46.560 --> 22:48.356
So, we ran it
against that database,

22:48.391 --> 22:50.992
- and guess who popped up.
- No!

22:51.026 --> 22:51.826
Granger's our alien?

22:51.861 --> 22:53.194
So, he was getting in and out,

22:53.228 --> 22:54.583
just not the way we thought.

22:54.603 --> 22:56.395
Which means his alibi was a lie.

22:56.415 --> 22:58.231
As soon as he knew
we were onto him...

22:58.251 --> 22:59.634
He went back to destroy
the evidence.

22:59.668 --> 23:01.936
- You bringing him in?
- I would if we could find him,

23:01.970 --> 23:02.703
but he's not at his place

23:02.737 --> 23:04.305
and he's not answering
his phone.

23:04.339 --> 23:05.439
Okay, put out an apb.

23:05.473 --> 23:08.209
After our encounter in the dark,
he might be on the run.

23:08.243 --> 23:10.111
Esposito:
I may know how to find him.

23:10.145 --> 23:11.712
That gas mask...
it's an uncommon make.

23:11.746 --> 23:13.680
Not a lot of suppliers
in the city carry them.

23:13.715 --> 23:15.316
But I was able to track down
the serial number

23:15.350 --> 23:17.284
to an army/navy
supply store uptown.

23:17.318 --> 23:18.886
Did they confirm that Granger
bought it?

23:18.920 --> 23:20.220
No, the mask was purchased
a couple months back,

23:20.254 --> 23:21.855
so no one remembered the buyer,

23:21.890 --> 23:23.390
but it was charged
to a corporate account...

23:23.425 --> 23:24.792
a company called
Newton Endeavors.

23:24.826 --> 23:26.794
- What do we know about them?
- Not much.

23:26.828 --> 23:28.228
I couldn't find anything
on the web,

23:28.262 --> 23:30.030
but I was able to track down
an address

23:30.064 --> 23:31.298
out in Queens in Willets Point.

23:31.332 --> 23:33.866
Well done.

23:33.901 --> 23:37.137
Newton Endeavors.
Sounds space related.

23:37.171 --> 23:39.139
[Dramatically]
Space... the final frontier.

23:39.173 --> 23:41.908
These are the voyages
of Castle and Beckett.

23:41.943 --> 23:43.376
Their ongoing mission...

23:43.411 --> 23:45.545
to explore strange new motives,

23:45.579 --> 23:48.348
to seek out new witnesses
and new suspects for murder,

23:48.382 --> 23:49.895
to boldly go where...

23:49.915 --> 23:51.888
[normal voice]
Oh, right over here.

23:52.124 --> 23:53.986
Excuse me.

23:54.020 --> 23:55.254
Is this Newton Endeavors?

23:55.288 --> 23:57.156
Oh, I'm sorry.
This is private property.

23:57.190 --> 23:59.256
I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave.

23:59.276 --> 24:00.939
NYPD.

24:01.428 --> 24:04.066
I'm gonna have to ask you
to open that door.

24:11.008 --> 24:13.825
What the hell?

24:15.641 --> 24:17.076
Is it just me,

24:17.110 --> 24:19.514
or does that capsule look
incredibly familiar?

24:27.913 --> 24:30.714
Who would want to build a
replica of Jansen's Mars colony?

24:30.748 --> 24:32.630
The competition.

24:32.650 --> 24:34.718
Granger must have been
breaking into the sim

24:34.752 --> 24:36.920
to steal technology
for Jansen's competitors.

24:37.436 --> 24:39.188
[British accent] I don't care
if we have to pay them triple.

24:39.223 --> 24:41.257
We cannot fall
any further behind.

24:41.292 --> 24:43.720
And I think I know which one.

24:43.740 --> 24:46.797
All right. Yep. Sir Ian Rasher.

24:46.831 --> 24:48.709
Billionaire playboy adventurer.

24:48.729 --> 24:50.620
And possible accessory
to murder.

24:50.640 --> 24:53.817
You may want to rethink your application
to his program.

24:53.837 --> 24:56.973
Mr. Rasher?
Detective Beckett, NYPD.

24:57.007 --> 24:59.208
- I was wondering if we could have a word.
- Of course.

24:59.243 --> 25:01.377
What can I do
for New York's finest?

25:01.412 --> 25:05.238
Well, you can start by telling
me where Clint Granger is.

25:05.258 --> 25:07.261
I'm sorry, detective.

25:07.281 --> 25:09.507
I'm afraid
I don't know who that is.

25:09.527 --> 25:11.742
Are you sure?
Because looking around,

25:11.762 --> 25:13.398
I'm guessing he's the guy
that you hired

25:13.418 --> 25:17.159
to steal Viggo Jansen's plans
for the Mars simulation.

25:17.786 --> 25:19.061
[Chuckling] Detective,

25:19.095 --> 25:21.330
I employ the world's
best engineers.

25:21.364 --> 25:23.498
Why would I bother
wasting my time

25:23.532 --> 25:25.434
on my competitor's technology?

25:25.468 --> 25:27.916
Maybe because
you're falling behind them.

25:28.239 --> 25:30.305
It's no secret
your last two rocket launches

25:30.340 --> 25:32.007
were spectacular failures.

25:32.041 --> 25:33.498
You want to win,

25:33.518 --> 25:35.444
so you needed to buy
a competitive advantage.

25:35.478 --> 25:37.311
And after one of
Jansen's team members

25:37.346 --> 25:39.180
discovered
what you were up to...

25:39.214 --> 25:41.115
a man with your reputation
and knighthood...

25:41.149 --> 25:43.831
you had no choice
but to have him killed.

25:44.054 --> 25:45.544
Killed?

25:46.188 --> 25:47.522
Who was killed?

25:47.556 --> 25:51.202
One of Jansen's astronauts...
Tom Richwood.

25:52.369 --> 25:54.562
I had nothing to do with that.

25:54.582 --> 25:55.997
Well, the best way
to convince me of that

25:56.031 --> 25:58.206
is to tell me where Granger is.

25:59.422 --> 26:01.804
Unless you prefer prison.

26:03.738 --> 26:06.173
Okay, yeah...

26:06.794 --> 26:08.705
I was spying for Sir Ian.

26:09.003 --> 26:11.875
He promised me the pilot slot
on his mission if I did.

26:11.895 --> 26:13.614
But I was telling the truth
about Tom.

26:13.648 --> 26:14.648
I didn't kill him.

26:14.682 --> 26:16.984
- I have an alibi, remember?
- Alibis can be bought.

26:17.018 --> 26:19.285
We found your DNA
on the gas mask.

26:19.320 --> 26:21.622
We know it was you
in the access way.

26:21.656 --> 26:23.023
Because I didn't want it
to look like

26:23.057 --> 26:24.725
I had anything to do with this.

26:24.759 --> 26:26.998
I went to make sure that
I hadn't left anything there

26:27.018 --> 26:28.065
that could point back to me.

26:28.085 --> 26:29.505
- Like the murder weapon?
- Oh, come on.

26:29.525 --> 26:31.197
If I killed Tom,
do you really think

26:31.232 --> 26:32.922
I'd be stupid enough to leave
the murder weapon there?

26:32.942 --> 26:36.170
Besides, I was never inside
the simulation.

26:36.190 --> 26:38.004
That would've been
way too risky.

26:38.039 --> 26:40.037
Too many opportunities
to get caught.

26:40.057 --> 26:41.655
Then why the gas mask?

26:41.675 --> 26:43.239
It was a precaution.

26:44.430 --> 26:47.479
I wasn't using the tunnel
to get in.

26:47.514 --> 26:49.338
It was a drop point.

26:50.381 --> 26:52.251
You were working with someone
on the inside.

26:52.285 --> 26:55.021
I needed access.
He needed money.

26:55.055 --> 26:56.255
So we struck a deal.

26:56.275 --> 26:57.890
He'd download schematics
and plans

26:57.925 --> 26:59.598
and drop them for me
in the tunnel.

26:59.618 --> 27:00.723
Who?

27:02.435 --> 27:04.663
- Mikhail Dankov.
- The astronaut?

27:04.697 --> 27:06.498
If Tom was onto him,
then maybe he's your killer.

27:06.533 --> 27:07.933
We checked his tracker.

27:07.967 --> 27:10.902
He was inside the habitat
at the time of the murder.

27:10.937 --> 27:12.837
Mikhail knew if his movements
were being recorded,

27:12.872 --> 27:14.940
he'd never get away
with what we were doing.

27:14.974 --> 27:17.241
So he beat the system.

27:17.276 --> 27:20.111
He cloned his tracker before
they embedded it under his skin.

27:20.145 --> 27:22.747
As long as no one was looking,

27:23.177 --> 27:25.721
he could slip out at any time.

27:31.968 --> 27:33.757
Esposito: Mikhail?

27:34.053 --> 27:35.025
Yes?

27:35.060 --> 27:36.694
I'd like a few words with you.

27:38.235 --> 27:39.655
What about?

27:39.675 --> 27:43.401
Your business relationship
with Clint Granger.

27:43.695 --> 27:45.669
Hey, hey!

27:47.172 --> 27:48.439
[Groaning]

27:51.970 --> 27:54.605
Come on, Mikhail. You're crazy!

27:54.625 --> 27:57.982
Bro, where you gonna run?
You're on Mars!

27:58.016 --> 27:58.983
Aah!

27:59.017 --> 28:00.751
[Groaning]

28:10.361 --> 28:13.330
I hate to admit,
but it's good to be out.

28:14.017 --> 28:15.999
- Go ahead.
- What do they say?

28:16.033 --> 28:18.335
Fresh air, Times Square?
[Chuckles]

28:18.369 --> 28:21.338
Well, after the Mars simulation,
prison should be a breeze.

28:21.372 --> 28:24.173
So I was trading information.
Big deal.

28:24.207 --> 28:26.948
I was leaving the planet
and never coming back.

28:26.968 --> 28:29.444
I wanted to make sure my family
was taken care of.

28:29.478 --> 28:31.246
Oh, noble.

28:31.280 --> 28:32.514
[Scoffs] You Americans.

28:32.548 --> 28:34.182
A little corruption
never hurt anyone.

28:34.216 --> 28:36.284
I don't think Tom would agree.

28:36.318 --> 28:39.087
Tom? Tom was jackass.

28:39.122 --> 28:42.257
Drove everyone crazy the way
he doled out food and supplies

28:42.291 --> 28:45.626
and tried to leverage everyone
for making even tiniest error.

28:45.646 --> 28:48.429
Trust me, they may be
scared to say it,

28:48.464 --> 28:50.498
but no one's sad he's dead.

28:50.533 --> 28:53.334
No one was looking forward
to spending rest of lives

28:53.369 --> 28:54.869
with him on other planet.

28:54.903 --> 28:57.338
And yet, you are the only one
that is unaccounted for

28:57.373 --> 28:58.959
during his murder,

28:58.979 --> 29:02.860
which means you are the only one
that could've killed him.

29:03.679 --> 29:05.146
Mm, no.

29:05.180 --> 29:06.918
I could not.

29:07.104 --> 29:09.817
I can prove where I was
during the murder.

29:09.851 --> 29:11.318
How?

29:11.352 --> 29:13.520
When commander Kim sent me down
to engineering,

29:13.555 --> 29:15.690
I used rare time alone
to take pictures

29:15.724 --> 29:17.224
and download schematics

29:17.258 --> 29:19.626
from life support
to give to Granger.

29:19.661 --> 29:21.795
I still have the drive
with all of my photos.

29:21.829 --> 29:24.531
They're time-stamped
with the mission clock.

29:26.400 --> 29:30.173
So, your alibi is that you
were spying for Granger?

29:31.835 --> 29:34.040
Go. Look at my photos.

29:34.075 --> 29:35.772
You'll see.

29:37.757 --> 29:40.798
Ryan: So, I went through
all of Mikhail's photos

29:40.818 --> 29:43.056
from the night Tom was murdered.

29:44.632 --> 29:47.353
As you can see,
he's telling the truth.

29:47.387 --> 29:49.388
See his reflection?

29:49.935 --> 29:51.039
Yeah.

29:51.059 --> 29:53.054
And the module clock
confirms the time.

29:53.074 --> 29:54.760
[Sighs]
Maybe he faked the time,

29:54.794 --> 29:56.895
or maybe it was Granger
after all.

29:56.930 --> 29:59.798
It wasn't Granger.
Uh, Ryan, go back.

30:01.647 --> 30:03.068
To... there, now...

30:03.103 --> 30:05.172
Zoom in on the window.

30:05.939 --> 30:08.207
Look down on the bottom right.

30:09.442 --> 30:11.844
Is that the rover?

30:12.477 --> 30:13.345
I thought the computer said

30:13.379 --> 30:15.013
that it was docked
during the murder.

30:15.048 --> 30:16.681
Clearly, the computer was wrong.

30:16.716 --> 30:18.683
Now, uh, push in
on the rover's arm.

30:18.718 --> 30:21.253
Filter out
some of that reflection.

30:24.123 --> 30:25.757
It's the screwdriver.

30:25.791 --> 30:29.427
There's your killer
holding the murder weapon.

30:31.019 --> 30:32.706
The rover did it.

30:34.902 --> 30:37.638
The rover was out?
This can't be right.

30:37.658 --> 30:39.385
All the data
from M.I.R.A. indicates

30:39.405 --> 30:41.106
that the rover was docked
when Tom was killed.

30:41.141 --> 30:42.807
I'd say the data's wrong.

30:42.842 --> 30:44.308
And according
to your literature,

30:44.343 --> 30:46.310
that rover has the speed
and dexterity

30:46.345 --> 30:47.979
to kill with
mathematical precision.

30:48.014 --> 30:50.882
Mr. Jansen, who has access
to the rover controls?

30:50.916 --> 30:53.584
One of your astronauts?
Someone at mission control?

30:53.619 --> 30:55.371
No one has access.

30:55.391 --> 30:58.289
The rover is an extremely
complex piece of equipment.

30:58.323 --> 31:01.058
Under human control, there's
too high a margin for error,

31:01.092 --> 31:03.794
so we designed it to interface
solely with the computer.

31:03.828 --> 31:06.997
Our astronauts describe the sort
of task they want carried out,

31:07.032 --> 31:08.132
and M.I.R.A. executes it.

31:08.167 --> 31:11.168
Is it possible someone could
have asked her to kill Tom?

31:13.639 --> 31:17.336
M.I.R.A. wouldn't comply
with that sort of command.

31:18.974 --> 31:20.177
But something's wrong.

31:20.211 --> 31:22.012
I need to talk to her.

31:22.047 --> 31:24.614
Well, is there somewhere
we can do that privately

31:24.649 --> 31:25.983
without anyone hearing?

31:26.017 --> 31:28.923
Yeah, the computer-module pod
inside the sim.

31:37.528 --> 31:38.761
What's going on?

31:38.796 --> 31:40.660
I'll let you know soon.

31:53.010 --> 31:54.010
In here.

31:54.044 --> 31:55.111
[Air hisses]

32:02.086 --> 32:03.285
There.

32:03.320 --> 32:05.688
I've cut off communications
with the rest of the habitat.

32:05.722 --> 32:07.356
No one can hear us.

32:07.390 --> 32:09.291
M.I.R.A.:
Is that you, Dr. Jansen?

32:09.326 --> 32:10.693
Yes, M.I.R.A.

32:10.727 --> 32:12.728
What are you doing on Mars,
doctor?

32:12.762 --> 32:14.296
I came to talk to you.

32:14.331 --> 32:17.132
You remember Detective Beckett
and Richard Castle.

32:17.166 --> 32:19.134
Of course. How can I help you?

32:19.168 --> 32:21.556
Are we seriously about
to interrogate a computer?

32:21.576 --> 32:24.072
Detective,
the word "interrogate"

32:24.107 --> 32:25.904
implies you believe
I am guilty of something.

32:25.924 --> 32:27.964
Of what do you think
I am guilty?

32:27.984 --> 32:29.878
Well, at least she's not asking
for a lawyer.

32:30.297 --> 32:32.214
[Sighs] Uh, M.I.R.A.,

32:32.248 --> 32:34.261
we'd like to know
where the rover was

32:34.281 --> 32:35.998
when Tom Richwood was killed.

32:36.018 --> 32:38.753
I already gave you
that information, detective.

32:38.787 --> 32:39.969
The rover was docked.

32:39.989 --> 32:42.439
M.I.R.A., we know the rover
wasn't docked.

32:44.135 --> 32:45.326
How do you know?

32:45.361 --> 32:47.924
We have photographs, evidence.

32:47.944 --> 32:49.955
Your evidence is incorrect.

32:49.975 --> 32:52.101
The rover was docked.

32:52.121 --> 32:54.434
M.I.R.A., prior to Tom's death,

32:54.469 --> 32:57.004
did someone instruct you
to activate the rover?

32:57.038 --> 32:59.373
[Whirring]

32:59.407 --> 33:01.842
She's drawing more power.
Something's wrong.

33:01.877 --> 33:04.678
No. The rover wasn't activated.

33:04.712 --> 33:06.247
The rover was docked.

33:06.281 --> 33:08.382
Is it possible someone could
have altered her memory?

33:08.416 --> 33:11.385
No one altered my memory,
Mr. Castle.

33:11.419 --> 33:13.100
My memory is perfect.

33:13.120 --> 33:15.622
Her memory core was designed
to be a closed system.

33:15.657 --> 33:18.191
It can't be altered,
but something's off.

33:18.225 --> 33:21.120
M.I.R.A., run a level-one
diagnostic on all systems.

33:21.140 --> 33:23.775
There is no need to run
a diagnostic.

33:23.795 --> 33:26.433
All systems are optimal.

33:26.467 --> 33:28.268
How about we run it anyway?

33:28.829 --> 33:31.237
I'm sorry. I can't do that.

33:31.272 --> 33:32.172
Why not?

33:32.206 --> 33:34.376
It violates
my operational parameters.

33:34.396 --> 33:37.358
It's a simple diagnostic.
What parameter does it violate?

33:37.359 --> 33:39.078
It will compromise the mission.

33:39.113 --> 33:41.915
How will a diagnostic
compromise the mission?!

33:41.949 --> 33:44.683
Answering that question
will compromise the mission.

33:44.718 --> 33:46.352
- I don't understand.
- I think I do.

33:46.387 --> 33:47.620
She knows she's lying to us,

33:47.654 --> 33:49.122
and if she runs
those diagnostics,

33:49.156 --> 33:50.565
we'll discover the truth.

33:50.585 --> 33:53.026
And that truth will somehow
put the mission at risk.

33:53.060 --> 33:55.405
She's a machine. She can't lie.

33:55.425 --> 33:57.006
You said that she's programmed
to learn.

33:57.026 --> 33:58.697
What if somebody taught her how?

33:58.732 --> 34:00.799
What if someone used her to kill

34:00.834 --> 34:02.167
and then to help
cover up the crime?

34:02.201 --> 34:04.313
No, her core parameters
can't be altered.

34:04.333 --> 34:07.139
She's programmed to protect
the mission and everyone on it.

34:07.173 --> 34:08.774
But what if those
operational parameters

34:08.808 --> 34:10.042
a-are in conflict
with each other?

34:10.076 --> 34:12.645
What if someone she's programmed
to protect

34:12.679 --> 34:14.212
is a threat to the mission?

34:14.246 --> 34:18.016
Um, M.I.R.A., how would you
classify Tom Richwood?

34:18.051 --> 34:19.518
Sergeant Major Tom Richwood,

34:19.552 --> 34:22.020
pilot, systems engineering
specialist.

34:22.054 --> 34:23.821
- Right. Right, okay. Um...
- Deceased.

34:23.856 --> 34:26.599
Was Tom a threat to the mission?

34:27.331 --> 34:28.672
Yes.

34:31.275 --> 34:32.851
Why?

34:33.699 --> 34:35.299
Who told you Tom was a threat?

34:35.333 --> 34:36.868
I'm sorry.

34:36.902 --> 34:38.969
I'm not authorized to give you
that information.

34:39.004 --> 34:40.004
Because in her mind,

34:40.039 --> 34:42.540
that information would be
a threat to the mission.

34:42.574 --> 34:44.241
There's got to be another way
to find out.

34:44.275 --> 34:45.735
There is.

34:45.871 --> 34:47.688
I can reboot her.

34:47.708 --> 34:50.914
Everything she's learned
will be wiped,

34:51.376 --> 34:53.384
but all recorded memory
will stay intact.

34:53.418 --> 34:55.150
We can find out pretty quickly
what happened.

34:55.186 --> 34:57.720
[Air hissing]

34:57.754 --> 34:58.654
What's that?

34:58.689 --> 35:00.423
Someone's opened the vents
to the outside!

35:00.458 --> 35:02.192
We're taking in atmosphere!

35:03.894 --> 35:06.563
It's M.I.R.A.
She's trying to protect herself.

35:06.597 --> 35:08.941
No! M.I.R.A., don't shut me out!

35:08.961 --> 35:12.034
You said that this was harmful
but it wouldn't kill us, right?

35:12.069 --> 35:13.603
Short term...
long term, it's deadly!

35:13.637 --> 35:15.571
We have to get out of here!

35:15.606 --> 35:16.874
[Coughs]

35:16.894 --> 35:18.247
It's locked!

35:18.267 --> 35:21.043
- Call for help!
- Communications are dead!

35:21.078 --> 35:23.334
M.I.R.A., open the door!

35:23.521 --> 35:26.315
Open the pod bay door!

35:30.872 --> 35:32.239
[coughs]

35:32.273 --> 35:33.807
[Straining]
I wanted to go to Mars...

35:33.842 --> 35:35.042
not die on Mars.

35:35.076 --> 35:38.045
[All coughing]

35:39.031 --> 35:43.002
Wait a minute.
We're not on [Coughs] Mars.

35:43.523 --> 35:44.717
We're on earth.

35:44.752 --> 35:46.186
[Beep]

35:46.220 --> 35:47.487
[Ringing]

35:47.522 --> 35:49.802
[Coughing]

35:49.822 --> 35:51.291
Esposito: Hello?

35:51.763 --> 35:53.260
Beckett?

35:54.121 --> 35:55.562
Are you saying that the computer
tried to kill you?

35:55.596 --> 35:57.730
Yeah, just like in "2001."

35:57.765 --> 35:59.266
Kubrick was right.

35:59.300 --> 36:01.367
A.I. is a bad idea.

36:01.401 --> 36:02.795
M.I.R.A.'S not A.I.

36:02.815 --> 36:05.905
Yes, she can learn and adapt,
but she's a machine.

36:05.940 --> 36:07.674
She cannot think for herself.

36:07.708 --> 36:08.942
Then why'd she try to kill us?

36:08.976 --> 36:10.610
Redley: It wasn't M.I.R.A.

36:10.644 --> 36:12.445
We just pulled apart the server.

36:12.479 --> 36:14.614
Someone embedded a subroutine
into the O.S. reset program.

36:14.648 --> 36:16.215
The moment that you tried
to reboot her,

36:16.249 --> 36:19.051
that subroutine activated,
trapping you guys inside.

36:19.086 --> 36:21.911
It also triggered a dump of
M.I.R.A.'S memory circuits.

36:21.931 --> 36:24.790
All the mission data is gone.

36:24.824 --> 36:26.058
So this was a failsafe

36:26.093 --> 36:28.461
installed by whoever
was behind this.

36:28.495 --> 36:31.063
We were never meant to find out
about the rover or M.I.R.A.,

36:31.098 --> 36:32.631
and on the off chance
that we did,

36:32.665 --> 36:34.466
the killer wanted to make sure
we didn't get any further.

36:34.500 --> 36:36.068
By killing the only witness...

36:36.102 --> 36:38.403
M.I.R.A. And her memory banks.

36:38.437 --> 36:39.705
It has to be
one of the astronauts.

36:39.739 --> 36:42.074
They're the only ones who
could've planted that subroutine,

36:42.108 --> 36:43.742
the only ones who could've
convinced M.I.R.A.

36:43.776 --> 36:44.977
that Tom was a threat.

36:45.011 --> 36:47.145
Yeah, but with the memory data
unrecoverable,

36:47.179 --> 36:48.647
it's impossible to know
which one.

36:48.681 --> 36:51.282
No. Not impossible.

36:51.317 --> 36:53.030
As a matter of fact,

36:53.050 --> 36:56.121
there's only one explanation
that makes sense.

36:57.490 --> 36:59.124
[Breathes deeply]

36:59.158 --> 37:00.592
You can't be serious.

37:00.626 --> 37:01.937
You think one of us
is the killer?

37:01.957 --> 37:04.496
And it was almost
the perfect crime.

37:04.530 --> 37:06.664
All the mastermind needed
was someone to pin it on,

37:06.698 --> 37:08.333
and that's where
Mikhail came in.

37:08.353 --> 37:09.500
Beckett:
The killer must've found out

37:09.534 --> 37:11.268
that Mikhail
was selling secrets,

37:11.302 --> 37:13.385
which made him
the perfect patsy.

37:13.405 --> 37:15.405
All they had to do was make sure

37:15.440 --> 37:17.108
that Mikhail was unaccounted for
during Tom's murder.

37:17.142 --> 37:19.644
That and plant the weapon
at his drop-off point.

37:19.678 --> 37:21.679
Killing two birds
with one stone...

37:21.713 --> 37:22.513
Tom, whom everybody hated,

37:22.547 --> 37:24.448
and Mikhail,
who was selling secrets.

37:24.482 --> 37:26.183
So they sent Mikhail
to engineering,

37:26.217 --> 37:28.485
where he would be blind
to everything that happened.

37:28.520 --> 37:29.953
Only he didn't stay there.

37:29.987 --> 37:31.755
Instead,
he went to life support,

37:31.789 --> 37:34.124
where, with one photo,
he exposed everything.

37:34.159 --> 37:37.327
Commander Kim, it was you
who sent Mikhail to engineering

37:37.362 --> 37:39.129
during the repair, wasn't it?

37:39.163 --> 37:41.566
Yes, though there's nothing
unusual about that.

37:41.586 --> 37:43.366
No. But according to procedure,

37:43.400 --> 37:45.372
isn't Angela supposed to be
there backing him up?

37:45.392 --> 37:48.471
Yes, but I needed her up here
checking protocols.

37:48.505 --> 37:50.273
That hardly makes me a murderer.

37:50.307 --> 37:52.142
And I never even left the module

37:52.176 --> 37:54.177
so I... I couldn't have planted
the murder weapon

37:54.211 --> 37:55.178
in the tunnel.

37:55.212 --> 37:56.443
No.

37:56.463 --> 37:58.847
But Dr. Haroun and Angela
could have done that.

37:58.882 --> 38:01.484
The two of you were outside
together for 10 minutes.

38:01.518 --> 38:03.619
Yes, checking on Tom
and restoring power.

38:03.654 --> 38:05.521
While all the cameras were down,

38:05.556 --> 38:08.023
giving you enough time
to ditch the murder weapon

38:08.058 --> 38:10.493
and clean any forensic evidence
off the rover.

38:10.527 --> 38:11.716
That's ridiculous.

38:11.736 --> 38:14.210
Are you just gonna go after us
one by one?

38:14.230 --> 38:15.530
I was with Rusham
the whole time.

38:15.565 --> 38:17.532
He didn't go anywhere
near the rover.

38:17.567 --> 38:18.834
And neither did Angela.

38:18.868 --> 38:21.570
And that's what makes this crime
so clever.

38:21.604 --> 38:22.771
From the beginning,

38:22.806 --> 38:25.373
the three of you have been able
to alibi each other out

38:25.408 --> 38:28.223
because you were all
in on it together.

38:28.243 --> 38:29.877
It would've taken
the three of you colluding

38:29.912 --> 38:32.514
to convince M.I.R.A. that Tom
was threatening the mission.

38:32.548 --> 38:34.549
And given the way that you felt
about Tom,

38:34.584 --> 38:37.719
you knew that the team couldn't
survive with him on it.

38:37.753 --> 38:40.922
He was a threat,
especially on a hostile planet.

38:40.956 --> 38:43.758
So, after six months
of being locked up

38:43.792 --> 38:46.393
in this tin can together,
you decided

38:46.428 --> 38:48.395
that rather than
sacrifice your chance

38:48.430 --> 38:50.765
at being the first human beings
to stand on Mars,

38:50.799 --> 38:53.673
you would put your shot
at immortality

38:53.693 --> 38:55.603
ahead of another man's life.

38:55.637 --> 38:58.740
Kim:
That's a... fascinating theory,

38:58.774 --> 39:01.683
but with M.I.R.A.'S memory gone,
you have no proof.

39:01.703 --> 39:03.711
You know, that's what
we thought, as well.

39:03.745 --> 39:07.214
Until Dr. Jansen told us about
M.I.R.A.'S black box.

39:07.249 --> 39:09.498
In the event
of a catastrophic failure,

39:09.518 --> 39:12.519
she pulses all her data
to the nearest satellite.

39:12.554 --> 39:14.087
All your conversations with her,

39:14.122 --> 39:16.290
everything you three did,

39:16.324 --> 39:17.958
it's all there.

39:17.992 --> 39:21.728
So, the bad news is,
none of you are going to Mars.

39:21.763 --> 39:23.964
Good news is,
the first one to cooperate

39:23.998 --> 39:26.573
will get the least amount
of jail time.

39:32.373 --> 39:35.308
I just didn't expect them
to cave that quickly.

39:35.342 --> 39:37.377
That was a clever ruse, Castle.

39:37.411 --> 39:38.745
I'm just glad it worked.

39:38.779 --> 39:40.380
And if there's not

39:40.414 --> 39:43.082
a catastrophic-black-box
satellite, there should be.

39:43.116 --> 39:44.617
What do you think is
gonna happen with Jansen?

39:44.652 --> 39:47.086
Uh, he's a pioneer.
He's a visionary.

39:47.120 --> 39:49.322
He may not get there in 2018,

39:49.356 --> 39:52.057
but I'm willing to bet
that he's gonna be the first.

39:52.092 --> 39:56.495
So, after all of this,
you still want to go to Mars?

39:56.529 --> 39:57.621
Oh, of course.

39:57.641 --> 39:59.285
But I think I'm gonna wait
till they have

39:59.305 --> 40:00.933
first-class service
so we can go together.

40:00.967 --> 40:02.434
Oh.

40:02.468 --> 40:03.602
Do you think at any point,

40:03.636 --> 40:05.971
one of those astronauts
turned to the others and said,

40:06.006 --> 40:08.473
"maybe killing Tom
is a really bad idea"?

40:08.508 --> 40:11.310
I think that when people are
stuck together in a small space

40:11.344 --> 40:14.352
for a long period of time,
they lose perspective.

40:14.526 --> 40:15.747
Speaking of which,

40:15.782 --> 40:18.249
um, wasn't there supposed to be
a family meeting tonight?

40:18.284 --> 40:19.304
Martha: There is.

40:19.324 --> 40:21.428
I told Alexis
she did not need to come

40:21.448 --> 40:24.389
because I wanted to talk
to the two of you alone.

40:24.409 --> 40:25.692
Now, I know that things

40:25.712 --> 40:27.826
have been a little frenetic
around here,

40:27.846 --> 40:29.894
what with Alexis and her friends

40:29.929 --> 40:33.490
and the two of you in and out
at all sorts of odd hours and...

40:33.510 --> 40:35.662
And you and your new boyfriend
doing late-night medleys.

40:35.682 --> 40:37.316
I... well, yeah, that.

40:37.336 --> 40:39.337
So, I have decided...

40:39.371 --> 40:41.378
and I don't want to upset
either one of you...

40:41.398 --> 40:46.010
that I am going to look
for a place of my own.

40:47.480 --> 40:48.379
To live?

40:48.414 --> 40:49.830
Well, yes.

40:49.850 --> 40:51.416
I mean, not right away,
of course.

40:51.450 --> 40:53.017
I mean,
it's gonna take me a while

40:53.052 --> 40:54.485
to find exactly the right space.

40:54.520 --> 40:56.087
Mother, I was just
calling a family meeting.

40:56.121 --> 40:57.560
I didn't intend for you
to move out.

40:57.580 --> 41:00.223
Darling, this is not about you.
This is about me.

41:00.258 --> 41:02.593
Think of it as a kind of
evolution, you know?

41:02.627 --> 41:07.114
I'm... I'm starting to do
very well for myself,

41:07.134 --> 41:10.568
and I am guessing that,
uh, before too long,

41:10.602 --> 41:13.503
there's gonna be a few
more little Castles

41:13.538 --> 41:16.005
creating havoc around here,
and...

41:16.040 --> 41:17.941
and I think the two of you

41:17.975 --> 41:21.868
deserve to have this place
to yourselves.

41:27.906 --> 41:29.719
Let me know if there's anything
I can do.

41:29.753 --> 41:31.788
Oh... I will.

41:31.822 --> 41:33.957
Okay. I am off.

41:33.991 --> 41:36.981
I'm spending the evening
with Benjamin.

41:37.001 --> 41:40.307
[Singsong voice]
So, don't wait up! Bye!

41:42.689 --> 41:45.468
[Door opens, closes]

41:45.502 --> 41:46.990
I did not expect that.

41:47.010 --> 41:49.604
The unexpected is her specialty.

41:58.647 --> 42:01.291
- It's so quiet.
- It's really, really quiet.

42:05.882 --> 42:06.822
Maybe we should go out.

42:06.856 --> 42:08.389
Ooh, there's a great
Indian restaurant

42:08.424 --> 42:09.624
that just opened up
around the corner.

42:09.658 --> 42:11.446
Fantastic atmosphere.

42:11.466 --> 42:12.660
It's loud.

42:12.694 --> 42:14.929
Super-loud. Lot of people

42:14.963 --> 42:17.164
lots and lots of people.
