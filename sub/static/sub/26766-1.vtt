00:19.375 --> 00:21.750
At age 55, after two decades in exile,

00:21.833 --> 00:23.750
Orson Welles returned to Hollywood

00:23.833 --> 00:26.458
to start work on his comeback film,
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WIND.

00:26.542 --> 00:28.458
Production began in 1970

00:28.542 --> 00:30.750
and lasted, off and on,
through early 1976,

00:30.833 --> 00:32.958
with editing continuing into the 1980s.

00:33.042 --> 00:35.500
Mired in complex legal, financial,
and political turmoil,

00:35.583 --> 00:37.458
he was not able to finish the picture.

00:37.542 --> 00:39.333
Welles died in 1985,

00:39.417 --> 00:41.208
leaving behind nearly 100 hours
of footage,

00:41.292 --> 00:43.518
a workprint consisting of assemblies
and a few edited scenes,

00:43.542 --> 00:45.542
annotated scripts, memos, thoughts,
and directives.

00:45.583 --> 00:47.623
This is an attempt to honor
and complete his vision.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.667
NETFLIX PRESENTS

01:08.792 --> 01:09.958
<i>That's the car...</i>

01:10.583 --> 01:12.542
<i>What was left of it after the accident.</i>

01:13.167 --> 01:14.667
<i>If it was an accident.</i>

01:15.708 --> 01:17.750
<i>Hannaford, before he changed his mind,</i>

01:17.875 --> 01:19.083
<i>was going to give the car</i>

01:19.167 --> 01:21.500
<i>to the young
leading actor of his last movie,</i>

01:22.333 --> 01:23.333
<i>John Dale.</i>

01:24.083 --> 01:26.125
<i>And Hannaford was supposed
to have saved him,</i>

01:26.208 --> 01:27.375
<i>at some earlier date,</i>

01:27.833 --> 01:29.375
<i>from committing suicide.</i>

01:30.375 --> 01:32.042
<i>Or so the story goes...</i>

01:32.750 --> 01:34.000
<i>As for his own death,</i>

01:34.708 --> 01:37.458
<i>his admirers were sure
that Hannaford did not intend</i>

01:37.542 --> 01:39.333
<i>to drive the car off that bridge.</i>

01:39.917 --> 01:41.500
<i>"A corny ending," they said.</i>

01:42.167 --> 01:44.750
<i>J.J. Hannaford would
never be guilty of that.</i>

01:45.667 --> 01:47.333
<i>But there were other opinions.</i>

01:50.375 --> 01:52.583
<i>He died many summers ago,</i>

01:52.875 --> 01:53.917
<i>July 2nd.</i>

01:55.167 --> 01:57.917
<i>For years, I personally didn't
want this document shown,</i>

01:58.000 --> 02:01.208
<i>because, frankly, I didn't likeÂ the way
I came off in the piece.</i>

02:02.125 --> 02:03.417
<i>But I'm old enough now,</i>

02:03.667 --> 02:04.958
<i>not to care anymore</i>

02:05.542 --> 02:08.375
<i>how my role in Jake's life
is interpreted.</i>

02:09.583 --> 02:11.208
<i>My name is Brooks Otterlake,</i>

02:11.583 --> 02:14.625
<i>probably Hannaford's
most successful acolyte.</i>

02:15.833 --> 02:17.792
<i>Anyway, this little historical document</i>

02:17.875 --> 02:19.875
<i>has been put together from many sources.</i>

02:20.833 --> 02:24.375
<i>From all the footage shot by
TV and documentary filmmakers,</i>

02:24.750 --> 02:27.250
<i>and also the students, critics
and young directors</i>

02:27.333 --> 02:30.042
<i>who happened to bring
16 and 8mm cameras,</i>

02:31.167 --> 02:32.542
<i>having been invited to Jake's</i>

02:32.958 --> 02:34.875
<i>70th birthday party.</i>

02:36.083 --> 02:38.375
<i>That was long before cell phone cameras</i>

02:38.458 --> 02:40.083
<i>and computerized images.</i>

02:41.208 --> 02:43.333
<i>The choice of this material is an attempt</i>

02:43.417 --> 02:46.125
<i>to sketch a film likeness
of the man himself as he looked...</i>

02:47.292 --> 02:49.833
<i>through all those different viewfinders.</i>

02:51.083 --> 02:53.750
<i>Hannaford's own unfinished
last motion picture</i>

02:53.833 --> 02:55.583
<i>is part of this testimony,</i>

02:56.458 --> 02:58.042
The Other Side of the Wind.

02:59.250 --> 03:01.625
<i>It has been left, just as it was</i>

03:01.708 --> 03:03.208
<i>when they showed it at his party,</i>

03:03.875 --> 03:05.625
<i>on what turned out to be</i>

03:06.250 --> 03:07.750
<i>the last day of his life.</i>

04:32.875 --> 04:34.417
Mark it. Steam Bath, Take nine.

04:36.375 --> 04:37.375
Action.

04:47.792 --> 04:49.125
<i>Alright, sweetie.</i>

04:49.583 --> 04:50.917
<i>You know where to go.</i>

04:54.333 --> 04:55.333
<i>Cut.</i>

04:56.833 --> 04:58.583
<i>Thank you, everybody, that's a wrap.</i>

04:59.375 --> 05:01.833
Jake, Brooksie's riding with you
if that's okay.

05:01.917 --> 05:04.625
Mr. Hannaford, your meeting
with wardrobe is at 8:00 a.m.

05:04.708 --> 05:06.684
Let's make it at 7:00.
Let's get the hell out of here.

05:06.708 --> 05:09.333
- Happy birthday, Jake!
- Same scene, 9:00 o'clock Monday.

05:10.458 --> 05:12.708
Zarah Valeska is the one giving the party.

05:12.792 --> 05:15.167
According to Jake,
she's the greatest cook in the world.

05:15.750 --> 05:20.375
Is she the one who talked Jake into
letting all the media get at him at once?

05:21.250 --> 05:22.917
We're the "Close Up on Hannaford" people.

05:23.042 --> 05:25.917
- And these ladies are from <i>Life,</i> I guess.
- Look over here!

05:26.583 --> 05:27.583
I'm independent.

05:27.792 --> 05:29.542
Pister, from The Film Institute.

05:29.708 --> 05:32.125
Everybody else not assigned transportation

05:32.208 --> 05:34.167
can collect in the carpool.

05:34.250 --> 05:35.792
Maggie, you can be chaperone.

05:36.208 --> 05:38.500
Mostly the nudies are
driving their own cars.

05:38.667 --> 05:40.458
I want to make sure they can get home.

05:40.542 --> 05:43.625
- And the beards?
- A TV special for the BBC.

05:43.708 --> 05:44.792
No, ma'am, CBC.

05:44.875 --> 05:47.833
I'm doing a film
and he's doing a book on Mr. Hannaford.

05:48.292 --> 05:50.417
And I know somebody somewhere
who isn't.

05:51.417 --> 05:53.500
But mine is the authorized biography.

05:53.750 --> 05:55.833
It's certainly one of them, Miss Rich.

05:56.417 --> 05:58.792
May I present Maggie Noonan,
our film editor.

05:58.917 --> 06:01.625
Miss Juliette Rich, the celebrated critic.

06:04.292 --> 06:06.458
Isn't that trying just a little hard
to be funny?

06:06.542 --> 06:09.417
Come on, Matt, I ain't trying to be funny.
Ask the boss.

06:09.625 --> 06:11.167
He thinks they're lousy.

06:11.667 --> 06:12.750
I know what he thinks.

06:12.833 --> 06:14.750
Hey, Costello, step over here, will ya?

06:14.833 --> 06:16.000
Who let you in?

06:17.625 --> 06:20.333
He'll want you with him, Mr. Otterlake.
He always does.

06:20.917 --> 06:22.625
- Where is he?
- Where's who?

06:24.083 --> 06:25.833
Where's Jake's car? Do you know?

06:26.000 --> 06:27.625
You want to ride out with the boss?

06:28.083 --> 06:30.417
You can just catch him at the studio gate.

06:30.500 --> 06:31.833
Mr. Pister.

06:31.958 --> 06:33.333
The first name is Marvin.

06:33.417 --> 06:34.542
- What?
- Isn't it?

06:34.625 --> 06:35.625
This is Matt Costello,

06:35.708 --> 06:37.750
he's Mr. Hannaford's personal assistant.

06:38.167 --> 06:40.042
I do all the dirty jobs.

06:40.125 --> 06:42.333
I'm supposed to be selling the picture.

06:42.417 --> 06:44.583
- You'll just have to wait.
- Hi, Billy.

06:44.875 --> 06:47.792
Sorry, Brooksie, I was talking to him.

06:48.667 --> 06:50.917
I guess you'll be riding with Jake,
wont you?

06:51.000 --> 06:52.042
So they tell me.

06:52.875 --> 06:53.875
<i>Once again!</i>

06:54.583 --> 06:58.125
<i>The bus with the green stripes,
marked "Students,"</i>

06:58.208 --> 06:59.500
<i>is for the students.</i>

06:59.583 --> 07:01.018
- We should ride with you.
- Let's go.

07:01.042 --> 07:02.442
Can you wait for our second camera?

07:03.708 --> 07:06.042
- You're going to make a...
- Hang on, wait for me.

07:06.125 --> 07:07.625
Come on!

07:08.667 --> 07:10.625
<i>The jazz musicians...</i>

07:10.708 --> 07:11.750
<i>and the midgets</i>

07:11.833 --> 07:14.167
<i>in the blue chartered bus.</i>

07:14.250 --> 07:15.458
Where's The Baron?

07:15.750 --> 07:16.750
Here, sir.

07:16.958 --> 07:18.917
What's the plan for the head
of the studio?

07:19.000 --> 07:20.792
Billy's screening the film with him.

07:21.250 --> 07:23.167
I know it should have been you, Baron,

07:23.250 --> 07:24.375
but according to Jake,

07:24.458 --> 07:26.333
I'm more Max's style.

07:27.083 --> 07:28.792
Who knows? Maybe he's right.

07:29.375 --> 07:30.375
Jake?

07:30.833 --> 07:32.042
Isn't he always?

07:32.250 --> 07:33.250
We'll see about that.

07:33.708 --> 07:36.167
I had hoped to ride with the naked ladies.

07:36.250 --> 07:37.890
You're lucky you aren't with the midgets.

07:37.958 --> 07:42.292
<i>All students from the Movie University
of Southern California...</i>

07:42.375 --> 07:43.958
<i>or whatever you are...</i>

07:44.042 --> 07:46.667
<i>in the bus with the green stripes.</i>

07:47.458 --> 07:50.500
According to Jake, I'm more Max's style.

07:52.208 --> 07:53.333
Maybe he's right.

08:01.167 --> 08:03.917
Hi, Max, remember me? Billy Boyle.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.042
I've seen you in some Hannaford films,
haven't I?

08:06.125 --> 08:08.417
Some early ones on very late TV.

08:08.500 --> 08:11.750
He let me play a few friends of the heroes
for a while.

08:12.583 --> 08:14.375
- We're both reformed...
- Where is he?

08:14.500 --> 08:15.667
...actors, aren't we?

08:17.417 --> 08:18.417
Jake?

08:18.625 --> 08:19.708
Well I...

08:20.167 --> 08:23.208
- I don't think we ought to wait for him.
- Is he still on the set?

08:23.625 --> 08:26.833
I don't actually know just
where he is at the moment.

08:27.292 --> 08:28.750
<i>Alright, the crew...</i>

08:29.375 --> 08:31.042
<i>the jazz musicians...</i>

08:31.333 --> 08:32.625
<i>and the midgets...</i>

08:32.957 --> 08:35.125
<i>in the blue chartered bus.</i>

08:35.667 --> 08:38.332
Zimmer, I've got a message for you.

08:39.917 --> 08:42.250
From Jake? I got that message.

08:42.332 --> 08:44.625
- Everybody got it.
- Not this message.

08:46.167 --> 08:47.667
I'm fired?

08:50.375 --> 08:51.458
That's the message?

08:54.458 --> 08:55.458
Why?

08:55.792 --> 08:57.500
Would somebody please tell me

08:57.583 --> 08:59.500
why I'm going to his party?

08:59.583 --> 09:00.625
You're invited.

09:00.708 --> 09:02.792
All these stupid dummies.

09:02.917 --> 09:03.917
They're invited.

09:11.750 --> 09:13.167
This is toward the beginning.

09:13.250 --> 09:15.625
It comes right after what we were
shooting today.

09:15.708 --> 09:17.375
She leaves the steam room

09:17.458 --> 09:19.583
and here's this character waiting for her.

10:19.542 --> 10:20.667
Right here!

10:20.792 --> 10:23.125
- Through the window right there.
- Come on, man.

10:23.250 --> 10:25.833
Life was never like this in Hicksville,
huh, Julie?

10:26.375 --> 10:29.208
- Hicksville?
- Yeah, that little town you were born in.

10:30.250 --> 10:32.625
I remember, Polack extraction.

10:32.958 --> 10:34.458
Richiviski?

10:35.125 --> 10:37.667
You seem to know quite a lot
about me, Mr. Costello.

10:38.458 --> 10:39.375
Call me Matt.

10:39.458 --> 10:42.250
Matt here, he knows about everybody.

10:42.333 --> 10:43.208
Keep it quiet.

10:43.292 --> 10:44.583
He's on that committee,

10:44.667 --> 10:47.458
the one that decides
if you're an American.

10:48.083 --> 10:51.000
Maybe you didn't knowÂ that these people
are still in business.

10:51.083 --> 10:53.167
You mean that Mr. Hannaford's
investigating me?

10:53.792 --> 10:55.417
We're still in business, huh?

10:58.042 --> 11:00.708
What am I going to see,
everything he's shot up until now?

11:00.792 --> 11:02.625
The first couple of reels, Max.

11:02.708 --> 11:05.125
The last part's already out at the ranch.

11:05.625 --> 11:07.458
Zarah's giving him this party.

11:07.542 --> 11:09.917
She's invited all these movie freaks.

11:10.250 --> 11:12.667
We'll see the rest of the stuff
when we get out there.

11:13.708 --> 11:15.375
Zarah's expecting you, Max.

11:18.250 --> 11:19.500
So is Jake.

11:20.375 --> 11:21.833
I was expecting him here.

11:26.042 --> 11:27.667
Fine. Rolling. Hello, hello...

11:27.792 --> 11:28.792
I'm ready to go.

11:28.833 --> 11:30.750
Just go right ahead and talk,
Mr. Hannaford.

11:30.833 --> 11:32.708
- Don't mind us.
- I'll go first.

11:32.792 --> 11:35.833
Mr. Hannaford, is the camera eye
a reflection of reality?

11:35.917 --> 11:38.542
Or is reality a reflection
of the camera eye?

11:39.125 --> 11:41.208
Or is the camera merely a phallus?

11:41.625 --> 11:42.625
I want a drink.

11:42.750 --> 11:44.190
You heard him.
Let's get it out here.

11:44.250 --> 11:47.083
We ought to start with a broader spectrum.
Don't you agree, Otterlake?

11:47.167 --> 11:50.208
That's true, the interview
is for everybody, not just us.

11:50.958 --> 11:52.917
But today, there's a special dispensation.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.208
Mr. Hannaford, could you please slow down?

11:55.292 --> 11:56.932
Otherwise, I'm going to fall off the car.

11:57.625 --> 11:59.125
Mr. Hannaford!

11:59.875 --> 12:02.167
- Dale something.
- John Dale, Max.

12:02.833 --> 12:04.583
He's the kid on the motorcycle.

12:15.583 --> 12:17.833
According to Jake, the box likes him.

12:18.542 --> 12:20.708
- Box?
- The old magic box.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.375
If the camera doesn't like an actor,
it just stares at him.

12:28.750 --> 12:30.083
That's what Jake says.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.750
And if the actor doesn't like
the old magic director?

12:36.292 --> 12:37.292
Yeah.

12:38.500 --> 12:40.375
Is it true Dale walked off the movie?

12:40.750 --> 12:41.792
Well...

12:43.125 --> 12:44.625
He'll come back.

12:47.625 --> 12:49.665
And if he doesn't come back,
how will you finish it?

12:51.583 --> 12:55.625
Come on, Zimmie, Jake's fine.
He's just like he always was.

12:55.875 --> 12:57.542
You know how he is sometimes.

12:58.167 --> 13:00.125
He's turning sour, Matt.

13:00.917 --> 13:02.292
He's going bad.

13:02.417 --> 13:06.250
- Put a can on it, will you?
- I'm a makeup man, an expert.

13:06.875 --> 13:09.792
All my life, I've been sticking my nose

13:09.875 --> 13:11.625
into other people's wrinkles.

13:13.375 --> 13:15.708
I know the little signs.

13:16.500 --> 13:19.917
Something you can almost... smell.

13:20.667 --> 13:22.208
That's what the gypsies say.

13:23.125 --> 13:23.958
Gypsies?

13:24.042 --> 13:26.000
Nine months
we practically lived with them.

13:26.292 --> 13:27.708
Jake's first picture, in Spain.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.250
- Come on. Get next to...
- All right, bring it.

13:38.333 --> 13:39.333
Good.

13:40.667 --> 13:41.667
Right there on her.

13:41.708 --> 13:44.042
Hey, can you look over here?

13:44.125 --> 13:45.458
<i>- That's it...</i>
- She's an Indian?

13:45.583 --> 13:47.208
A red, red Indian.

13:47.625 --> 13:48.625
In the story.

13:48.833 --> 13:50.625
You'll meet her at the party, Max.

13:55.625 --> 13:57.208
How does the box feel about her?

14:03.958 --> 14:06.708
To assess, Mr. Hannaford,
just how fully that theme in your work

14:06.792 --> 14:08.476
may be a reflection
of your father's suicide.

14:08.500 --> 14:09.583
The suicide can wait.

14:09.958 --> 14:11.708
We ought to start
with a broader spectrum.

14:11.792 --> 14:13.250
Don't you agree, Otterlake?

14:13.375 --> 14:15.458
Mr. Hannaford, began his career...

14:16.417 --> 14:17.458
as a prop man.

14:17.583 --> 14:18.833
For the old cliffhangers.

14:18.917 --> 14:21.875
- You were a property man?
- Bombs, buzz saws...

14:21.958 --> 14:23.875
pits full of deadly serpents...

14:23.958 --> 14:25.417
He provided all the...

14:26.458 --> 14:30.500
Skipper, don't turn on the radio.
I'm telling your life story.

14:31.042 --> 14:32.417
This was in Hollywood?

14:32.500 --> 14:33.750
Of course it was Hollywood.

14:33.833 --> 14:39.458
He shared a bungalow
with his first leading man. You know?

14:39.958 --> 14:42.833
I even know his name. Frank Fryer.
How about that, Skipper?

14:43.250 --> 14:45.625
I'm the only one who's
not doing a book about you.

14:46.125 --> 14:48.958
My book on Hannaford has been canceled.

14:49.042 --> 14:50.958
- Canceled?
- Indefinitely.

14:51.583 --> 14:53.042
The first five chapters

14:53.333 --> 14:57.167
took the two of us
three and a half years to do.

14:57.250 --> 15:00.042
I finally had to start directing myself
so I could eat.

15:00.125 --> 15:01.583
The rest is history.

15:01.667 --> 15:03.542
And now, I suppose you're too busy.

15:03.958 --> 15:05.167
We both are.

15:05.792 --> 15:07.083
But take it from me, fellas.

15:07.167 --> 15:10.250
Our friend here,
he just hates being interviewed.

15:10.875 --> 15:13.750
So, I donated a lot of my old tapes.

15:14.250 --> 15:18.000
Scattered them here and there
among you cineastes.

15:19.583 --> 15:21.875
To spare him as many questions
as possible.

15:22.583 --> 15:23.583
Answers.

15:24.250 --> 15:25.667
Answers are my department.

15:26.250 --> 15:27.792
John Dale, for instance.

15:32.167 --> 15:33.625
He looks like a girl.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
They all do nowadays. Don't they?

15:37.083 --> 15:38.417
That's how they want to look.

15:38.500 --> 15:39.875
It's the scene.

15:40.625 --> 15:41.708
Which scene?

15:41.792 --> 15:42.917
"The" scene.

15:46.292 --> 15:48.208
And you old guys are
trying to get with it.

15:50.792 --> 15:52.333
Is that what this movie is about?

15:52.833 --> 15:53.833
Kids today...

15:53.917 --> 15:56.250
Kids today? What the hell
do you know about it?

15:57.500 --> 15:59.417
What does Jake know at his age?

15:59.500 --> 16:00.542
He better know.

16:00.625 --> 16:03.750
The way I hear it,
he's putting up his own money.

16:03.833 --> 16:05.417
The bank wanted a name.

16:05.708 --> 16:07.000
Jake wanted him.

16:07.792 --> 16:08.792
A baby.

16:09.500 --> 16:11.000
The world's full of them, Zimmie.

16:11.500 --> 16:13.417
Or haven't you noticed?

16:13.833 --> 16:15.458
Early Hannaford films...

16:17.083 --> 16:18.500
- Silents.
- Silents?

16:20.333 --> 16:22.708
Action pictures. Plenty of action.

16:23.083 --> 16:25.625
Jake and Frank, used to strip to the waist

16:25.917 --> 16:27.167
every Saturday night...

16:27.375 --> 16:28.917
and they put their pay envelopes

16:29.292 --> 16:30.958
on the mantelpiece,

16:31.042 --> 16:32.750
and they'd fight each other for the pot.

16:32.833 --> 16:33.958
What ever happened to him?

16:34.083 --> 16:35.208
Fryer?

16:36.083 --> 16:37.167
I don't know, kid.

16:38.792 --> 16:39.833
They come and they go.

16:40.375 --> 16:41.750
John Dale, for instance...

16:42.375 --> 16:44.917
Yes, the latest of all those actors
you've discovered.

16:45.292 --> 16:47.583
Discovered?
Like you went pearling for them?

16:48.375 --> 16:50.875
Squeezed your movie star
out of an oyster?

17:09.916 --> 17:11.291
No editing really.

17:11.375 --> 17:12.708
It's just the slates cut off.

17:13.250 --> 17:14.291
Gumdrop?

17:14.875 --> 17:18.041
Alright, men, let's get organized.
Where should we start?

17:18.875 --> 17:20.916
Where old Dad here ran away to sea,

17:21.000 --> 17:23.750
or way back with your ancestors?

17:24.291 --> 17:25.875
Save your voice, Skipper.

17:26.166 --> 17:28.458
It's all here on the tapes.
Right here, listen.

17:29.292 --> 17:31.708
<i>Most of the old actor managers
were micks.</i>

17:32.042 --> 17:35.542
<i>Barrett, McCullough, Hannaford, O'Neil..
What else was there to be?</i>

17:36.000 --> 17:39.375
<i>You carried bricks, or got into politics,
or went on the stage.</i>

17:39.833 --> 17:42.958
<i>Old Junius Hannaford was pretty big
in high tragedy.</i>

17:43.875 --> 17:46.375
<i>And Junius Jr.,
as befits the second generation,</i>

17:47.083 --> 17:48.667
<i>made it into high society.</i>

17:49.167 --> 17:50.333
<i>A pioneer snob,</i>

17:50.417 --> 17:52.667
<i>blazing the trail for
the Kellys and the Kennedys.</i>

17:54.583 --> 17:56.458
<i>Randy Moore, for instance,</i>

17:56.625 --> 17:57.958
<i>he was a prop boy.</i>

17:58.417 --> 17:59.958
<i>David Leigh was an extra.</i>

18:00.542 --> 18:02.250
<i>Neil Trevor, Branch Sutter,</i>

18:02.333 --> 18:03.458
<i>Glen Garvey...</i>

18:03.833 --> 18:05.250
<i>I happened to notice them.</i>

18:05.458 --> 18:06.458
Just listen.

18:06.542 --> 18:07.542
<i>But Dale I found.</i>

18:08.292 --> 18:09.208
<i>Literally.</i>

18:09.292 --> 18:10.500
<i>Fished him out of the sea.</i>

18:10.792 --> 18:12.833
<i>That's what you'd call a discovery.</i>

18:12.917 --> 18:14.000
Do you get it?

18:14.417 --> 18:16.458
He saved the cat's life.

18:16.833 --> 18:19.458
So, the boy's indebted to him
even for that.

18:20.667 --> 18:23.708
Could you imagine
a relationship more all-consuming?

18:24.375 --> 18:26.167
Between master and slave?

18:26.375 --> 18:29.292
<i>Dale was flopping around
like something you'd bring up in a net.</i>

18:29.875 --> 18:30.792
<i>We did what we could.</i>

18:30.875 --> 18:33.000
<i>Kept him on the yacht,
signed him on as a deckhand,</i>

18:33.083 --> 18:34.708
<i>made a sailor of him, or tried to.</i>

18:35.375 --> 18:36.792
<i>Sure, I rescued him.</i>

18:36.875 --> 18:38.917
<i>I've been rescuing him ever since.</i>

18:39.042 --> 18:40.625
Look what he did with the others.

18:40.958 --> 18:42.833
Glen Garvey, Courtney Saxon...

18:42.917 --> 18:46.250
Courtney? He was selling vacuum cleaners
when Jake discovered him.

18:46.917 --> 18:49.208
As for Hannaford himself...

18:49.292 --> 18:50.125
What about him?

18:50.250 --> 18:52.375
Branch Sutter, he was a dishwasher.

18:52.458 --> 18:55.000
It could be he's wrong this time.

18:55.083 --> 18:55.917
Who says so?

18:56.000 --> 18:57.125
Zimmer says so.

18:57.917 --> 19:00.417
I don't know what I think of this one.

19:00.583 --> 19:01.583
Who does?

19:02.250 --> 19:03.250
Jack Simon?

19:03.750 --> 19:05.000
See that cop back there?

19:08.167 --> 19:09.667
You guys are overloaded.

19:09.875 --> 19:10.917
Thanks, Jack.

19:11.333 --> 19:12.792
Somebody's gonna have to go.

19:14.292 --> 19:15.500
Pister, you're it.

19:15.667 --> 19:16.667
Come on.

19:17.042 --> 19:18.208
Can he ride with you, Jack?

19:19.250 --> 19:20.583
I haven't got the insurance.

19:22.458 --> 19:23.542
See you at the party.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
Thanks, Jack.

19:25.083 --> 19:27.458
Good luck getting to the party, Pister.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.042
What happens here?

19:41.167 --> 19:42.708
I'm not really sure, Max.

19:44.667 --> 19:47.042
Maybe it's here she leaves the...

19:48.292 --> 19:49.292
the bomb.

20:05.208 --> 20:06.583
Having fun, Mr. Pister?

20:06.667 --> 20:09.417
The people in the last car were
kind of awful.

20:09.500 --> 20:10.875
Mr. Hannaford's car?

20:10.958 --> 20:12.000
They threw me out.

20:12.333 --> 20:16.125
Then I got a ride with a bunch
of video freaks.

20:16.417 --> 20:19.292
But they ran out of gas,
or needed a fix or something.

20:21.667 --> 20:23.000
What are the toys about?

20:23.625 --> 20:26.000
Before this, she'll be pretending

20:26.083 --> 20:27.708
to look in the window at him.

20:27.958 --> 20:30.167
That is, when we get around
to shooting it.

20:33.875 --> 20:35.125
She some kind of crook?

20:35.958 --> 20:37.375
Some kind of radical.

20:37.458 --> 20:40.458
Anyway, there's some more shops there,

20:40.542 --> 20:43.625
and the boy thinks she's been looking
at these dolls.

20:46.958 --> 20:47.958
Which doll?

20:48.583 --> 20:49.917
The one she...

20:50.375 --> 20:52.000
he thinks she was looking at.

20:52.083 --> 20:53.083
SHOT MISSING

20:53.167 --> 20:54.167
So...

20:54.833 --> 20:57.083
he goes in and buys it for her.

20:57.875 --> 20:59.167
May I see that, please?

21:01.125 --> 21:01.958
Jake wrote that?

21:02.042 --> 21:04.875
It's transcribed from tapes, I guess,
but it hasn't been typed.

21:05.542 --> 21:07.375
"The hippies and the beatniks.

21:07.458 --> 21:08.292
The bums.

21:08.375 --> 21:10.167
Call them what you want to.

21:10.833 --> 21:13.792
They slouch and slack around the floor

21:13.875 --> 21:15.708
because they like it down there.

21:16.292 --> 21:18.375
Talk about the return to the womb.

21:18.958 --> 21:21.208
What about the return to the cave?

21:23.042 --> 21:25.833
Junk is how you get there.

21:26.167 --> 21:28.167
That's how you dig your way back."

21:28.375 --> 21:29.208
Drugs.

21:29.292 --> 21:32.250
"Junk, for the cool dreams, kid.

21:33.042 --> 21:36.542
And the cool, dim, anonymous gang-shag.

21:36.625 --> 21:38.583
The mutual jack off."

21:39.250 --> 21:41.250
That's sure telling it like it is.

21:50.542 --> 21:52.625
- What's in the package?
- The package?

21:52.708 --> 21:54.458
You mean what she's got in her bag.

21:55.250 --> 21:57.542
It's either a bomb or her lunch.

21:57.917 --> 21:59.458
The kid's package.

21:59.875 --> 22:01.167
That's the doll.

22:05.208 --> 22:06.375
Tell me, Jimmy...

22:06.750 --> 22:07.750
Billy.

22:08.208 --> 22:09.208
Okay, Jimmy.

22:10.375 --> 22:11.625
There is going to be film

22:11.708 --> 22:13.667
showing that
there's a doll in this package?

22:14.000 --> 22:15.875
Sure, that's easy, Max.

22:15.958 --> 22:17.250
Just an insert.

22:22.208 --> 22:23.375
And the bomb?

22:30.542 --> 22:31.792
And if there is a bomb,

22:33.125 --> 22:34.583
- when does it blow up?
- Well...

22:34.667 --> 22:37.542
We don't actually know.

22:42.417 --> 22:43.625
What do we know?

22:45.750 --> 22:49.208
- You better ask Jake.
- I better read the script.

22:55.667 --> 22:56.708
There isn't one.

23:00.542 --> 23:02.917
Jake is just making it up
as he goes along.

23:04.958 --> 23:06.333
He's done it before.

23:07.833 --> 23:10.167
Dream projections of Hannaford himself.

23:10.667 --> 23:11.792
Man, they're real.

23:11.958 --> 23:14.042
He made them real.
He gave them existence.

23:14.458 --> 23:16.500
He molded them out of clay.

23:16.583 --> 23:18.417
Or cut them out with a pair of scissors.

23:18.500 --> 23:19.750
He conceived them.

23:20.375 --> 23:21.375
Like a god.

23:23.417 --> 23:24.875
A terrible and jealous god.

23:24.958 --> 23:27.250
That's what he's been
with this new boy of his.

23:27.542 --> 23:30.708
John Dale is Hannaford's
personal creation.

23:31.542 --> 23:32.875
There's something else, too.

23:33.333 --> 23:34.833
An even stronger claim.

23:35.458 --> 23:38.292
Very much in the Hannaford style.

23:46.292 --> 23:49.042
Understand, Max,
this isn't even a rough cut.

23:49.458 --> 23:50.292
Sure.

23:50.375 --> 23:52.208
You'll have to see
the rest of the picture.

23:52.542 --> 23:54.500
And Jake's going to have to shoot it.

23:55.125 --> 23:56.458
Like I told you, Max,

23:56.542 --> 23:59.333
an awful lot of the footage
is out at the ranch.

23:59.792 --> 24:02.292
We'll be screening it for you,
at the party.

24:03.333 --> 24:05.042
Tell Jake he wasted my time.

24:29.333 --> 24:31.792
Just a little more basil.
Otherwise, it's good.

24:40.042 --> 24:41.875
- He's right over there, see him?
- Yeah.

24:42.833 --> 24:44.667
Nobody can do it like you,
Miss Valeska.

24:44.750 --> 24:45.833
No. Nobody.

24:50.292 --> 24:52.417
It's open season tonight, Mr. Otterlake.

24:52.750 --> 24:54.250
We are in public domain.

25:01.083 --> 25:03.833
Major studio is a bullshit word,
but that's the word.

25:03.917 --> 25:06.708
- I made a picture that made money.
- That's what I had to do.

25:06.792 --> 25:08.851
What about people who can't
make a picture that makes money?

25:08.875 --> 25:12.042
They're not interested in making a picture
that makes money. That's my point.

25:12.125 --> 25:14.000
He's a man who could take a mediocre idea

25:14.083 --> 25:15.958
and do something
absolutely atrocious with it.

25:16.042 --> 25:18.833
- But it's absurd.
- It's absurd, I thought it was groovy...

25:18.917 --> 25:20.317
Inevitably, the need to make money,

25:20.375 --> 25:22.215
creates the need
for a certain kind of picture.

25:22.292 --> 25:23.333
And the picture...

25:23.792 --> 25:25.875
- That's Jewish logic.
- I'm Jewish.

25:25.958 --> 25:27.458
I guess that's your opinion.

25:27.542 --> 25:30.958
The ontology of its iconography
is so incredibly facile...

25:31.042 --> 25:33.625
If you indulged in aestheticism
for its own sake,

25:33.708 --> 25:35.417
it could be called an abstract.

25:35.500 --> 25:38.375
If the audience can't get it,
what's the point of going to the movie?

25:38.458 --> 25:39.792
I'm trying to...

25:39.875 --> 25:42.292
I'd like to get John Wayne's audience
in to see my movie.

25:42.375 --> 25:45.625
You've got an entire revolution going on
in this country on every level.

25:45.708 --> 25:47.309
You think it won't be reflected in films?

25:47.333 --> 25:49.833
It's not a real revolution.
Not the way you think it is.

25:50.292 --> 25:53.000
There's still rich people,
poor people starving, and a middle class.

25:53.083 --> 25:54.500
Why wouldn't they listen to me?

25:54.583 --> 25:55.708
What assholes they were,

25:55.792 --> 25:57.917
and what a dying dinosaur
they were involved in.

25:58.250 --> 26:00.250
Why are you defending a corrupt system?

26:00.333 --> 26:03.458
I'm not defending the system.
You don't see the point at all.

26:03.542 --> 26:04.542
I hate the system.

26:04.625 --> 26:08.708
I think that it's relatively easy
to make a good movie.

26:09.625 --> 26:10.708
Not a great one.

26:11.125 --> 26:12.417
That's something else.

26:12.500 --> 26:13.500
Hannaford's new movie?

26:13.750 --> 26:15.208
You do know about that.

26:15.292 --> 26:17.708
Yes, indeedy, ma'am.
We'll be seeing you there tonight.

26:17.792 --> 26:21.708
Not this character. You won't see him.
Not until they find an actor for it.

26:21.792 --> 26:24.875
Mostly, we're supposed to feel him
spying on the boy,

26:25.292 --> 26:26.917
and on the girl too, of course,

26:27.000 --> 26:28.208
from the shadows.

26:28.292 --> 26:30.083
Am I quoting you correctly?
Of course I am.

26:30.167 --> 26:32.833
- Of course.
- She has total recall.

26:32.958 --> 26:34.667
And a perfectly splendid imagination.

26:34.750 --> 26:36.559
Don't try and be cute,
just answer the question.

26:36.583 --> 26:39.292
- Would you repeat it, please?
- I didn't think you asked anything.

26:40.042 --> 26:41.667
I guess I haven't asked it.

26:41.750 --> 26:44.167
I just want to know what he represents.

26:44.250 --> 26:46.958
As I conceive of it,
this character in the film,

26:47.042 --> 26:49.250
he's sort of a hermit living out there.

26:49.625 --> 26:51.625
There is a possibility.

26:51.792 --> 26:53.167
A Peeping Tom.

26:53.542 --> 26:54.750
You tell us.

26:54.917 --> 26:56.458
This part we didn't cast.

26:56.917 --> 26:58.292
This old man.

26:58.958 --> 26:59.958
He's Hannaford.

27:02.333 --> 27:03.417
Hannaford himself.

27:04.833 --> 27:07.417
Mr. Hannaford. Happy birthday!

27:11.500 --> 27:12.833
And many more, sir.

27:17.208 --> 27:18.917
Mr. Hannaford. It's me.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.958
Happy birthday, Jake.

27:21.042 --> 27:24.375
- Mr. Hannaford.
- Happy birthday.

27:24.458 --> 27:26.208
I'm Marvin P. Fassbender.

27:26.750 --> 27:27.792
Of course you are.

27:31.125 --> 27:32.833
Mr. Hannaford.

27:57.292 --> 27:59.625
Mr. Otterlake, is it true
you're planning a Western?

27:59.792 --> 28:01.167
This is Mr. Hannaford's night.

28:01.250 --> 28:03.292
Let's save the questions for him.

28:03.542 --> 28:07.000
- You two are very close, aren't you?
- I'd like to ask you about that.

28:07.167 --> 28:08.667
- Why?
- Come on, Otterlake.

28:09.333 --> 28:11.458
Why do you think you have to be
as rude as he is?

28:11.542 --> 28:13.417
As rude as you are. In print anyway...

28:13.500 --> 28:15.140
- I liked your last picture.
- Yeah, sure.

28:15.750 --> 28:17.750
I know that it was repetitive,

28:17.833 --> 28:19.833
but... but...

28:20.042 --> 28:21.542
But... Oh, shit.

28:21.625 --> 28:23.425
- Such language.
- For what it was, it worked.

28:24.375 --> 28:27.000
She wasn't that kind in her review.
Not that you did me much harm.

28:27.083 --> 28:28.208
How much harm can you do

28:28.292 --> 28:30.417
to the third biggest grosser
in movie history.

28:30.500 --> 28:32.708
Did it really make that much?
How modest.

28:32.792 --> 28:35.583
Did you know that when
his production company goes public,

28:35.667 --> 28:37.958
that your friend stands to walk away with

28:38.042 --> 28:39.250
forty million dollars?

28:39.750 --> 28:41.000
Forty million dollars?

28:41.083 --> 28:43.875
And she'll keep on writing
that I stole everything from you.

28:43.958 --> 28:47.417
- I'm never going to walk away from that.
- It's alright to borrow from each other.

28:47.542 --> 28:49.458
What we must never do
is borrow from ourselves.

28:53.750 --> 28:55.917
Of course you are close, you two.

28:56.500 --> 28:57.625
You have to be.

28:58.542 --> 28:59.542
You have no choice.

29:02.833 --> 29:04.042
Please, dear lady...

29:04.875 --> 29:07.083
don't tell us what you mean by that.

29:13.042 --> 29:14.292
Kill the music, will you?

29:14.375 --> 29:16.083
They're still shooting Zarah there.

29:16.167 --> 29:17.917
That's what she wanted,
don't you think?

29:18.000 --> 29:20.458
Okay, if she says so.
She's picking up the tab.

29:21.417 --> 29:23.667
Gypsies, jazz and mariachis,

29:23.750 --> 29:24.792
all for a bunch of creeps

29:24.875 --> 29:27.500
who only want
to listen to themselves talking. Jesus.

29:28.875 --> 29:30.792
Zarah Valeska, take one, scene two.

29:32.417 --> 29:34.333
Zarah, speaking of great men,

29:34.417 --> 29:36.542
your name has been linked romantically

29:36.625 --> 29:38.458
with quite a few celebrities.

29:39.625 --> 29:41.833
Wasn't it understood that we weren't

29:41.917 --> 29:43.917
going to talk about love affairs?

29:44.958 --> 29:47.708
What you agreed to talk about
is Mr. Hannaford.

29:47.792 --> 29:49.208
A fascist, for Christ sake.

29:49.292 --> 29:51.708
Hannaford, no.
How about Jack Simon, right here?

29:52.000 --> 29:53.208
You tell us, Brooksie.

29:53.333 --> 29:55.167
Jack's got it in his contract.
Right, Jack?

29:55.417 --> 29:58.375
Every picture he directs,
he gets to shoot the animals personally.

29:58.542 --> 29:59.542
With a gun.

29:59.958 --> 30:01.208
They even pay him off in guns.

30:01.292 --> 30:03.208
No, they pay me money, kid.

30:03.917 --> 30:05.542
And they say I imitate him.

30:07.417 --> 30:10.167
That's your thing, Otterlake,
you're good at imitations.

30:11.250 --> 30:12.250
Do Jack Benny.

30:12.833 --> 30:14.458
He's the one that's into guns.

30:14.542 --> 30:16.542
A fascist? Shall we define our terms?

30:16.625 --> 30:18.625
Spades, spics, micks, hunkies,

30:18.708 --> 30:21.917
honkies, hebes, those kind of terms?

30:22.000 --> 30:24.667
Fasci-tists? We don't like
them kinda people.

30:24.833 --> 30:27.000
- What kind of people does he like?
- Nobody.

30:27.333 --> 30:28.333
Nobody at all.

30:28.875 --> 30:30.208
Nobody in the plural.

30:30.417 --> 30:32.167
And then, who in the particular?

30:33.208 --> 30:34.583
Mr. Otterlake, for instance.

30:35.542 --> 30:36.708
Miss Valeska.

30:37.125 --> 30:41.958
It's been reported that you call him
"G.F." sometimes.

30:42.833 --> 30:44.333
Jokingly, of course.

30:44.667 --> 30:45.792
Is that right?

30:45.875 --> 30:48.083
G.F. meaning "God the Father."

30:49.833 --> 30:51.125
I call Mr. Hannaford,

30:52.083 --> 30:53.125
Mr. Hannaford.

30:53.208 --> 30:54.375
<i>God isn't dead.</i>

30:54.833 --> 30:57.458
<i>Reflection of your attitude.
Right, Mr. Hannaford?</i>

30:57.958 --> 30:59.875
<i>Well, kid. He's certainly Jewish.</i>

31:00.250 --> 31:01.333
Thus spaketh Jake.

31:01.917 --> 31:02.750
What's that about?

31:02.833 --> 31:04.292
One of your old tapes, Brooksie?

31:04.417 --> 31:06.083
I've deeded them all over to the cause.

31:06.167 --> 31:08.167
Tapes from that book
you're doing, Otterlake?

31:08.250 --> 31:09.750
From that book we're <i>not</i> doing.

31:09.917 --> 31:11.917
You're the first big director
that ever tried

31:12.000 --> 31:13.792
- to write about...
- First one to give up.

31:13.875 --> 31:16.375
But I still know all the material.
You know, religion.

31:16.958 --> 31:19.125
Here it is, The Gospel
According to Jake.

31:19.917 --> 31:22.625
God the Father, is an old Jew,

31:23.125 --> 31:25.167
invented by a lot of other old Jews

31:25.250 --> 31:27.625
in a hopeless attempt to put down
the Jewish mother.

31:28.250 --> 31:29.417
Jewish mother?

31:29.958 --> 31:31.708
That's what he says the new scene
is about.

31:31.792 --> 31:32.792
You know? Everything,

31:33.625 --> 31:34.708
even his movie.

31:34.792 --> 31:36.333
What's that about the movie?

31:36.417 --> 31:38.083
We don't talk about the movie.

31:38.375 --> 31:39.583
Try the Baron here.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.250
Under torture, he might squeal a little.

31:42.333 --> 31:43.208
He writes the scripts.

31:43.292 --> 31:45.417
So, Mr. Hannaford likes to say.

31:45.667 --> 31:47.208
Please, don't pretend to be stupid.

31:47.292 --> 31:50.917
You're supposed to be the brainy one
in this club, or clan or whatever...

31:51.000 --> 31:53.625
It's a highly informal organization, lady.

31:53.708 --> 31:55.208
The tape that we were hearing.

31:55.292 --> 31:57.042
The subject is God.
Is he a member?

31:57.125 --> 31:58.125
She...

32:00.750 --> 32:02.833
We're all ruled by the wind,
aren't we, lady?

32:03.875 --> 32:05.583
So, if the Lord is a lady,

32:05.667 --> 32:08.542
and God's will is her will,
then we can all relax

32:08.625 --> 32:11.417
and stop expecting
the universe to be logical.

32:11.833 --> 32:13.208
You heard the man, lady.

32:13.542 --> 32:15.333
We're right back where we started.

32:16.417 --> 32:17.458
Back to Mama.

32:17.542 --> 32:19.667
That's when Brooksie's at his best.

32:19.833 --> 32:22.583
When he's using
straight Hannaford dialogue.

32:23.417 --> 32:25.250
Gee, that's real nice, Jack,
coming from you.

32:28.042 --> 32:29.792
- What I'd like to clarify...
- Yes?

32:30.083 --> 32:31.458
- Is...?
- Yes?

32:34.625 --> 32:36.250
Is...

32:36.750 --> 32:39.208
how his disciple feels about
the new Hannaford film.

32:39.292 --> 32:40.458
- Who?
- Who?

32:40.583 --> 32:41.458
You.

32:41.583 --> 32:42.708
Hey, why pick on me?

32:42.917 --> 32:45.042
The man is infested with disciples.

32:45.125 --> 32:46.542
I'm the apostle, lady.

32:47.000 --> 32:48.333
Just like Saint Paul.

32:48.458 --> 32:49.917
I know the lyrics to that one too.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.083
We're sure you do, Brooksie.

32:52.583 --> 32:55.333
Yeah, the Apostle Paul packaged it.

32:55.417 --> 32:56.542
By now, Jesus was dead.

32:56.625 --> 32:58.167
You be quiet for about 30 seconds.

32:58.417 --> 32:59.417
And...

32:59.958 --> 33:02.042
so the subject was in public domain,

33:02.125 --> 33:03.125
and...

33:04.042 --> 33:05.958
Let's see. Where was I, folks?

33:07.583 --> 33:09.917
So, when Paul dreamed up Christianity...

33:10.875 --> 33:11.875
and...

33:15.417 --> 33:17.750
and stuck the "anity" into Christ...

33:17.875 --> 33:20.958
As long as I'm still twitching, Brooksie,
you won't stick in into me.

33:22.250 --> 33:23.708
Isn't that just what he's doing?

33:24.083 --> 33:25.625
Movies and friendship...

33:26.375 --> 33:27.458
those are mysteries.

33:27.542 --> 33:29.542
And religion. The Baron's into that,

33:29.625 --> 33:31.042
and I know his material too.

33:31.125 --> 33:32.542
You ought to get away from both.

33:32.625 --> 33:35.083
"A mystery may reveal.

33:35.625 --> 33:37.667
It never explains." Right?

33:37.750 --> 33:38.583
Yes.

33:38.667 --> 33:40.417
Just like you, Mr. Hannaford.

33:40.583 --> 33:42.333
Just like me and God.

33:42.708 --> 33:46.000
If it weren't for the difference in sex,
how could you tell us apart?

33:49.750 --> 33:52.250
- Are those supposed to be John Dale?
- He asked for them.

33:52.375 --> 33:55.083
It was Mr. Hannaford's idea.

33:55.958 --> 33:56.958
How's this one?

33:57.458 --> 33:58.583
Fine, Joey.

34:00.458 --> 34:01.542
So how do they look?

34:04.917 --> 34:06.375
Stupid, that's how they look.

34:07.000 --> 34:08.167
Your leading man.

34:08.958 --> 34:10.708
The poor, sick, hungry kid

34:10.792 --> 34:13.833
you pulled out of the water
and stuck into pictures,

34:14.417 --> 34:16.208
the orphan, Mr. Johnny Dale.

34:16.750 --> 34:18.292
Do you know where he came from?

34:18.375 --> 34:20.000
Where he really came from?

34:20.083 --> 34:22.083
A big rich family in Ohio.

34:22.208 --> 34:23.958
How do you like them apples?

34:24.458 --> 34:27.042
He didn't break out of any reformatory.

34:27.542 --> 34:29.792
He graduated from boarding school,

34:29.875 --> 34:31.542
one of the snotty expensive ones.

34:31.917 --> 34:33.625
We found one of his teachers.

34:33.833 --> 34:35.708
He's coming right out here with Billy.

34:36.208 --> 34:39.583
- Billy is supposed to bring Max David.
- When is he joining the party?

34:40.458 --> 34:41.458
He isn't.

34:42.417 --> 34:43.417
No?

34:43.875 --> 34:46.333
- Any word from Texas?
- The oil money?

34:49.292 --> 34:50.292
None yet.

34:53.250 --> 34:54.375
Well, here it is...

34:55.250 --> 34:57.125
if anybody wants to see it.

34:57.625 --> 35:00.208
Darling, this marvelous bash
you're giving him,

35:00.292 --> 35:02.542
if I'm to understand, your whole idea

35:02.625 --> 35:05.875
was to get Jake Hannaford in touch
with the new generation.

35:06.583 --> 35:08.333
And vice versa. Yes.

35:09.083 --> 35:11.708
Very few of your guests are his own age.

35:13.292 --> 35:15.625
Most people of Mr. Hannaford's age

35:15.708 --> 35:16.958
are too old for him.

35:17.042 --> 35:18.042
Hey, beautiful.

35:19.875 --> 35:20.875
Hello.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.667
We don't have much of a past...
do we, beautiful?

35:24.750 --> 35:27.125
We made just half of a picture together.

35:27.417 --> 35:29.458
That was in Miss Valeska's country.

35:30.250 --> 35:31.250
In Austria.

35:31.667 --> 35:33.375
- What happened?
- Hitler.

35:33.708 --> 35:35.625
- That's what happened.
- He threw you out?

35:35.958 --> 35:37.250
She threw him out.

35:38.417 --> 35:40.000
Her USO Troop led our...

35:40.333 --> 35:41.458
armies into battle.

35:41.625 --> 35:43.625
I witnessed it from the rear.

35:43.750 --> 35:45.708
But you did liberate the Ritz.

35:45.792 --> 35:48.292
Her friend Hemingway put in for that one.

35:48.375 --> 35:50.292
Jake was three bottles ahead of him.

35:50.375 --> 35:51.708
Where did you come from?

35:52.333 --> 35:53.583
The studio.

35:53.917 --> 35:55.042
Jake, I told you.

35:56.250 --> 35:57.250
Hemingway?

35:58.000 --> 36:00.833
That left hook of his was overrated.

36:01.125 --> 36:04.375
"Every man contains within himself...

36:05.292 --> 36:07.292
the whole condition of humanity."

36:07.417 --> 36:08.792
Write that down, somebody.

36:09.375 --> 36:10.375
Somebody did.

36:10.833 --> 36:12.208
She even gave me the book.

36:12.292 --> 36:14.750
Mr. Hannaford enjoys
pretending to be ignorant.

36:14.833 --> 36:18.917
Then she spoiled the present
by telling me who gave it to her.

36:19.125 --> 36:20.125
Who?

36:20.208 --> 36:22.375
Just someone he doesn't happen to like.

36:22.542 --> 36:24.250
The queers adore great women.

36:24.500 --> 36:28.083
They like all women, Uncle.
They're the only sex that does.

36:28.208 --> 36:29.208
True.

36:29.958 --> 36:31.542
Real men never like us.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.500
Men only like men.

36:33.708 --> 36:36.917
And women keep us away from each other.

36:37.375 --> 36:40.542
"But if I cut him off," we ask ourselves,

36:41.208 --> 36:43.625
"cut him off from all his good companions,

36:44.333 --> 36:45.708
what will be left of him?"

36:46.417 --> 36:47.708
An amputee, perhaps,

36:48.042 --> 36:49.583
an emotional basket case...

36:49.708 --> 36:52.458
You chop away all the same.

36:54.625 --> 36:57.125
Half a man is better than none.

36:57.542 --> 36:59.833
Happy birthday, Jake.

36:59.917 --> 37:03.375
As I open my mouth, we raise our glasses
to a great gentleman,

37:04.042 --> 37:06.375
who is not only a great artist,

37:06.542 --> 37:09.583
but one who's been called
the Ernest Hemingway of the cinema.

37:10.208 --> 37:13.375
The Murnau of the American motion picture.

37:13.458 --> 37:14.958
Who Murnau is, I don't remember.

37:15.625 --> 37:17.875
Let me see,
Murnau and Dean, the vaudeville act.

37:17.958 --> 37:20.792
As I recall, we played
in either Loews Newark

37:20.875 --> 37:23.083
or Pickleton-on-Thames in Great Britain.

37:23.167 --> 37:24.833
That's enough, Georgie.

37:26.458 --> 37:27.750
You ought to make a wish.

37:28.292 --> 37:29.292
What for?

37:29.583 --> 37:31.667
The one thing you'd most like to have.

37:33.000 --> 37:36.625
Or... one last thing you'd like to do.

37:37.958 --> 37:39.708
Don't you think it can happen?

37:40.375 --> 37:41.792
It'll take a lot of blowing.

37:43.167 --> 37:45.208
That should be a job for Miss Rich.

37:47.083 --> 37:51.375
She'd huff and puff
and blow the house down.

38:09.417 --> 38:11.292
Okay, let's get to the movie, shall we?

38:42.625 --> 38:47.375
<i>It's so nice
To feel the colors</i>

38:47.958 --> 38:52.083
<i>All days when you are new</i>

38:52.792 --> 38:55.208
<i>You close your eyes</i>

38:55.292 --> 39:00.583
<i>And feel the foam of silence</i>

39:03.750 --> 39:08.917
<i>Running home and cease to happen</i>

39:09.292 --> 39:14.000
<i>Phase across the path of time</i>

39:15.875 --> 39:17.042
HEAD

39:17.125 --> 39:19.875
<i>You see them coming</i>

39:19.958 --> 39:23.792
<i>That heaven left behind</i>

39:38.667 --> 39:43.667
<i>I can see you
When you're laughing</i>

39:44.083 --> 39:48.958
<i>Laughing when you're having fun</i>

39:49.042 --> 39:52.000
<i>Your head is glowing</i>

39:52.083 --> 39:57.333
<i>Overflowing with good times</i>

40:00.333 --> 40:05.500
<i>Listen for the water droplets</i>

40:06.000 --> 40:10.125
<i>Falling from the ledge</i>

40:10.750 --> 40:16.417
<i>Of birds you heard from grapevine sounds</i>

40:16.500 --> 40:20.833
<i>Of people that you need</i>

40:23.833 --> 40:25.375
VACANT
OCCUPIED

40:33.875 --> 40:36.750
I definitely think that dress
cost way too much money.

40:53.292 --> 40:57.708
<i>It's so nice
To feel the colors</i>

40:58.250 --> 41:03.000
<i>All the days when you are new</i>

41:03.375 --> 41:05.958
<i>You close your eyes</i>

41:06.042 --> 41:11.542
<i>And feel the foam of silence</i>

41:14.750 --> 41:20.375
<i>Listen for the water droplets</i>

41:20.458 --> 41:24.333
<i>Falling from the ledge</i>

41:25.375 --> 41:31.000
<i>Of birds you heard
From grapevine sounds</i>

41:31.083 --> 41:35.708
<i>Of people that you need</i>

49:35.458 --> 49:36.292
Yes.

49:36.458 --> 49:37.917
Well, start the movie again.

49:38.000 --> 49:38.875
I can't.

49:38.958 --> 49:40.083
Why can't you?

49:40.292 --> 49:41.625
Because it doesn't work.

49:41.708 --> 49:42.917
What doesn't work?

49:43.000 --> 49:44.042
The projector.

49:44.125 --> 49:45.250
Which projector?

49:45.333 --> 49:46.458
Both of them.

49:48.458 --> 49:49.708
What happened, Jake?

49:49.792 --> 49:52.125
Who knows. Johnny Dale, maybe.

49:52.292 --> 49:53.125
Dale?

49:53.208 --> 49:55.928
He could have snuck into the generator
with his little monkey wrench.

49:56.417 --> 50:00.167
- What is this, another energy crisis?
- There's too many of these camera lights.

50:00.292 --> 50:03.125
Never went in much for symbolism,
did we, Baron?

50:03.417 --> 50:05.792
Alright now, let me have your attention.

50:06.292 --> 50:08.792
We've got a power failure on our hands.

50:09.167 --> 50:11.917
The ranch's generators have broken down.

50:12.000 --> 50:16.375
But we hope the situation
will be temporary.

50:16.458 --> 50:18.875
Meanwhile, we'll be getting lamps for you

50:18.958 --> 50:20.458
from out in the stables,

50:20.750 --> 50:22.250
and lighting up candles,

50:22.583 --> 50:25.917
so you can find your way to the booze
and the eats.

50:26.667 --> 50:29.083
Projection of Mr. Hannaford's
motion picture,

50:29.167 --> 50:31.042
<i>The Other Side of the Wind,</i>

50:31.250 --> 50:33.250
will naturally be suspended.

50:33.333 --> 50:35.083
Until the juice comes on,

50:35.167 --> 50:36.792
we trust you good folks

50:36.875 --> 50:40.292
will find your own ways
to amuse yourselves.

50:40.375 --> 50:42.292
All passengers to the life boats.

50:42.458 --> 50:45.083
Our gallant musicians will keep
right on until the end.

50:45.333 --> 50:46.542
They can't see the notes,

50:46.625 --> 50:48.625
but that's alright, they can't read them.

50:48.708 --> 50:52.250
Abie, how nice to see you looking so old.

50:52.542 --> 50:54.458
- You getting anything?
- Not with color.

50:54.833 --> 50:56.750
- Black and white, maybe?
- Black and white?

50:56.833 --> 50:58.500
Whistling in the dark, old man?

50:58.583 --> 51:01.625
Well, kid, you whistle or you whimper.
How is it in your corner?

51:01.708 --> 51:03.375
Who got him an invitation?

51:03.458 --> 51:05.292
Confrontation's the word for it.

51:05.500 --> 51:07.375
Abie, take it up with the hostess.

51:07.458 --> 51:09.542
Zarah? You must be nuts.

51:09.667 --> 51:12.375
Mother seems to think a little young blood
would be good for us.

51:12.458 --> 51:13.750
She could be right at that.

51:14.292 --> 51:15.292
She's always right.

51:16.208 --> 51:17.208
Excuse me, fellows,

51:17.250 --> 51:19.417
I think we have ourselves
a confrontation.

51:19.750 --> 51:23.458
I dig. It's not that he didn't make any
female stars.

51:23.792 --> 51:26.292
It's just that he didn't make them stars.

51:26.375 --> 51:27.833
That's my whole thesis.

51:27.917 --> 51:30.000
Great thesis.
So, the old man can still score.

51:30.083 --> 51:31.083
Who says so?

51:31.542 --> 51:34.458
How he scores and who he scores with,

51:35.208 --> 51:37.917
that, my friend, gets us
into some very interesting country.

51:38.750 --> 51:40.667
Okay, Zarah, no romance.

51:40.750 --> 51:42.583
You meant with Mr. Hannaford, I suppose?

51:42.917 --> 51:44.125
There wasn't any.

51:44.208 --> 51:46.417
I do wish you could bring yourself
to open up,

51:46.500 --> 51:47.542
just a little, on Jake.

51:47.625 --> 51:48.792
No sex at all.

51:58.583 --> 52:00.792
- This way, Mr. Burroughs.
- Dr. Burroughs.

52:01.292 --> 52:02.833
We have our own generator.

52:03.125 --> 52:04.625
This sometimes happens.

52:04.792 --> 52:06.458
These are our storyboards.

52:08.833 --> 52:10.167
All these.

52:11.167 --> 52:12.958
- Here.
- Thank you.

52:13.417 --> 52:15.809
These arrows show they're going
to move in for a closer shot.

52:15.833 --> 52:18.375
- A zoom or a dolly?
- It doesn't make any difference.

52:18.458 --> 52:20.708
- Of course it does.
- Okay.

52:21.958 --> 52:23.417
Looks like a crutch, I guess.

52:38.458 --> 52:39.726
- Go in on the left.
- Here, yeah.

52:39.750 --> 52:41.042
- Run the cable?
- I'm good.

52:41.125 --> 52:43.375
- More light here? Watch the boom.
- He's coming.

52:43.458 --> 52:44.917
Tomorrow's Sunday, Mavis.

52:45.625 --> 52:47.958
You'll be flying down with us to Mexico.

52:48.042 --> 52:49.917
- What for?
- <i>MontaÃ±a Rojas.</i>

52:50.250 --> 52:51.542
- Who?
- Bulls.

52:52.250 --> 52:54.125
A very dangerous breed, sweetie.

52:54.833 --> 52:56.583
One of them once killed a friend of ours.

52:57.333 --> 52:59.375
We'll see what happens
to our new boy tomorrow.

52:59.833 --> 53:02.250
Gee, I don't know.
I have school on Monday.

53:02.958 --> 53:05.167
I'll write a note to your teacher.

53:06.417 --> 53:08.083
Who's the joker with the cigarette?

53:08.667 --> 53:09.500
Miguel.

53:09.583 --> 53:10.958
He was the best of all.

53:11.167 --> 53:12.167
Best of what?

53:12.667 --> 53:14.375
The best of all our bullfighters.

53:14.458 --> 53:17.208
We followed old Miguel all over Spain.

53:17.667 --> 53:20.792
That's Jake, aiming his gun at him
in the shooting gallery.

53:20.875 --> 53:21.875
Another birthday.

53:23.500 --> 53:24.708
What a party that was.

53:25.667 --> 53:27.750
No bums, no movie buffs,

53:27.833 --> 53:30.042
no spies, no spooks, just...

53:30.167 --> 53:31.958
paid up members of the club.

53:32.292 --> 53:34.625
- Miguel Ortega.
- The best.

53:34.917 --> 53:37.042
- Number one.
- Until he got killed.

53:37.250 --> 53:39.333
Dad, I hope you weren't responsible
for that.

53:39.417 --> 53:41.083
I just had one shot at him.

53:41.167 --> 53:42.167
I missed.

53:42.250 --> 53:43.500
But he got the cigarette.

53:44.500 --> 53:45.833
Get that spook out of here.

53:45.917 --> 53:47.458
Come on, you guys, out of here!

53:47.542 --> 53:49.000
- Hey, Mister.
- Get out of here!

53:50.042 --> 53:52.000
- Respect Mr. Hannaford's privacy.
- Go on, go.

53:52.083 --> 53:53.083
You too.

53:56.417 --> 53:59.000
Hey, Billy,
why don't you leave that jukebox alone?

53:59.083 --> 54:01.000
That thing doesn't work with solar energy.

54:01.083 --> 54:02.625
I need some new music.

54:02.875 --> 54:05.417
And you shall have it, boy,
wherever you go.

54:05.958 --> 54:08.250
A one and a two and a three.

54:15.500 --> 54:16.792
That's great.

54:18.583 --> 54:21.083
Where the hell is Matt?
He should be taking this call.

54:21.458 --> 54:23.125
Stupid, that's how they look.

54:24.292 --> 54:25.292
Yeah?

54:27.083 --> 54:29.292
Go on in, Zimmie. Have a drink.

54:30.333 --> 54:31.333
How could I?

54:34.042 --> 54:35.042
Besides...

54:35.958 --> 54:37.917
I don't know these people.

54:38.667 --> 54:40.208
It's a whole new business.

54:42.167 --> 54:44.792
These leading actors nowadays...

54:45.875 --> 54:46.875
Stars even.

54:48.000 --> 54:49.417
I don't know their names.

54:49.917 --> 54:51.167
You know the dummy's name?

54:51.625 --> 54:53.667
Old Pat here says we can never guess.

54:53.833 --> 54:54.833
John Dale?

54:55.500 --> 54:57.375
Oscar, that was his real name.

54:57.833 --> 54:59.792
You know at school
what he was famous for?

55:00.125 --> 55:01.250
Fornication?

55:01.708 --> 55:03.500
We got somebody coming here tonight

55:03.583 --> 55:05.583
who's going to tell us all about it.

55:06.375 --> 55:07.375
Yeah?

55:08.458 --> 55:10.667
- Darryl Zanuck?
- A message for him.

55:11.000 --> 55:14.417
It's for Pocahontas, or whatever it is
Jake calls her.

55:14.500 --> 55:16.125
She's in there at the screening.

55:16.458 --> 55:17.708
Come on in, Zimmie.

55:17.833 --> 55:19.500
Join the fun and games.

55:20.458 --> 55:23.417
All those Mr. Dales of yours
are certainly lifelike.

55:24.917 --> 55:26.208
So is Mr. Dale.

55:26.500 --> 55:28.500
To look at him,
you'd swear he was real.

55:31.542 --> 55:32.708
I got a message.

55:33.167 --> 55:35.500
You, Minnehaha. It's for you.

55:36.333 --> 55:37.333
From Zanuck.

55:37.750 --> 55:40.750
Call his secretary first thing
Monday morning for an appointment.

55:40.833 --> 55:43.625
- He's got a picture for her.
- Darryl? Swell.

55:43.708 --> 55:45.833
- When's he joining the party?
- He isn't.

55:46.500 --> 55:48.667
The Hannaford mafia isn't
looking very festive.

55:48.792 --> 55:52.375
- What's the big worry, Skipper?
- They like to worry.

55:54.417 --> 55:57.333
Worry is their thing.
Four days is a long time.

55:57.542 --> 55:59.208
- Four days until what?
- Friday.

55:59.750 --> 56:00.750
Thanks, sweetie.

56:01.000 --> 56:03.292
- Could you get me one, please?
- What?

56:07.583 --> 56:08.667
What's Friday?

56:09.167 --> 56:10.167
Friday we...

56:10.625 --> 56:11.625
close down.

56:12.000 --> 56:15.208
Jesus, you can't finish the picture
in four days.

56:15.458 --> 56:18.750
I've been over-schedule before.
Let's drink to that.

56:21.167 --> 56:23.708
How many times have
you been broke, Skipper?

56:25.167 --> 56:27.125
At my present age, Brooksie...

56:27.792 --> 56:30.250
just... once.

56:34.542 --> 56:36.458
Terrific. It's nice being alone.

56:41.250 --> 56:44.125
All right now. Let me have your attention.

56:44.333 --> 56:47.625
A small auxiliary generator
from the stables

56:47.708 --> 56:50.917
has been hooked up
to the movie projector.

56:51.292 --> 56:53.375
If you'll all proceed quietly,

56:53.458 --> 56:55.750
to Mr. Hannaford's
private projection room.

56:55.833 --> 56:57.208
Yes, Mavis.

56:57.292 --> 56:59.333
They got the projector fixed.
Didn't you hear?

56:59.458 --> 57:01.750
- Didn't we all.
- Aren't you coming to the movie?

57:01.833 --> 57:03.875
Yes, but first, we need
a little more booze.

57:04.083 --> 57:06.333
We wouldn't want to go in there alone,
would we?

57:17.083 --> 57:20.458
I want to show you something you may like.
Best seat in the house.

57:41.250 --> 57:42.500
SHOT MISSING

58:10.917 --> 58:11.917
Excuse me.

58:12.750 --> 58:13.750
He's in there.

58:15.208 --> 58:16.500
With all the other guests.

58:17.208 --> 58:19.458
Watching himself on the screen, isn't he?

58:19.875 --> 58:21.000
Isn't who?

58:21.458 --> 58:24.333
- Oscar... John, John Dale.
- Yeah?

58:24.417 --> 58:26.750
Yes, your leading man.

58:26.833 --> 58:28.542
Not my leading man, buddy boy.

58:51.167 --> 58:52.625
You've seen this before.

58:53.083 --> 58:55.375
How is it that they don't have any...

58:56.125 --> 58:56.958
clothes?

58:57.125 --> 58:58.125
They got wet.

58:58.583 --> 58:59.667
In the other reel.

58:59.833 --> 59:01.208
- Wet?
- She didn't know him,

59:01.292 --> 59:02.667
but she grabbed his raincoat.

59:02.750 --> 59:04.833
That was last night in this other reel.

59:05.333 --> 59:06.500
And now it's today.

59:06.750 --> 59:09.250
She took off her clothes in the toilet...
in here...

59:09.875 --> 59:12.435
And this morning, he's got
his pants hung up to dry in the train.

59:12.875 --> 59:13.958
Train.

01:00:48.292 --> 01:00:49.542
<i>Are we still rolling?</i>

01:00:50.417 --> 01:00:51.500
<i>Good. Keep shooting.</i>

01:01:22.167 --> 01:01:23.167
<i>Listen, kid.</i>

01:01:23.708 --> 01:01:24.708
<i>Listen.</i>

01:01:26.833 --> 01:01:29.542
<i>Somebody's watching you. You can feel it.</i>

01:01:31.625 --> 01:01:33.250
<i>There's somebody else out there.</i>

01:01:40.542 --> 01:01:41.833
<i>Up there in that window.</i>

01:01:42.667 --> 01:01:44.333
<i>There's nothing behind that window.</i>

01:01:44.417 --> 01:01:45.458
<i>They're all the same,</i>

01:01:45.542 --> 01:01:47.625
<i>there's somebody up there peeking down.</i>

01:01:50.333 --> 01:01:51.833
<i>Did he drop the scissors?</i>

01:01:58.042 --> 01:02:00.042
<i>But watch it, boy.</i>

01:02:04.750 --> 01:02:05.958
<i>She has her own ideas.</i>

01:02:08.667 --> 01:02:09.667
Leigh...

01:02:10.292 --> 01:02:11.292
Kingman...

01:02:11.708 --> 01:02:12.792
Branch Sutter...

01:02:13.583 --> 01:02:14.583
Garvey...

01:02:15.333 --> 01:02:16.708
Absent friends.

01:02:20.333 --> 01:02:21.458
And John Dale.

01:02:22.042 --> 01:02:23.625
Not in the same league.

01:02:24.417 --> 01:02:25.417
Believe me.

01:02:27.208 --> 01:02:28.208
It's funny...

01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:31.042
I didn't see one of those men
here at your party tonight.

01:02:31.125 --> 01:02:33.458
Tonight is for the freakos
and the snoops, lady.

01:02:33.542 --> 01:02:35.292
If you'll excuse us, please.

01:02:35.833 --> 01:02:37.559
Did you know they had
dissolves in Shakespeare?

01:02:37.583 --> 01:02:39.750
Ask Mr. Hannaford. He knows
everything in Shakespeare.

01:02:39.833 --> 01:02:41.673
Shakespeare, that's
the Hannaford family curse.

01:02:41.750 --> 01:02:44.833
He knows everything about the Hannafords,
which is my curse.

01:02:45.167 --> 01:02:47.167
Everybody knows about old Granddad.

01:02:47.667 --> 01:02:50.833
Junius the First, in the tinseled toga.

01:02:50.958 --> 01:02:53.292
His limbs were always covered
in dirty pink tights.

01:02:53.375 --> 01:02:54.375
IN THE CURSE OF THE CLAN

01:02:54.458 --> 01:02:55.542
So as not to...

01:02:55.875 --> 01:02:58.625
inflame the female members
of his audience.

01:02:58.708 --> 01:03:01.375
Right, Skipper? That's where
the Shakespeare first comes from.

01:03:01.458 --> 01:03:04.667
Mr. Hannaford, would you sit
in the ancestral throne, Mr. Hannaford?

01:03:05.167 --> 01:03:06.287
Shall we give him a picture?

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.000
Shall we not?

01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:16.542
Later, okay?

01:03:16.917 --> 01:03:18.875
- Come on, let's go.
- Later. Way later.

01:03:18.958 --> 01:03:20.500
This is a waste of time anyway.

01:03:39.333 --> 01:03:40.833
The noblest Roman.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:45.292
Shanty Irish.

01:03:48.125 --> 01:03:49.625
And lace curtain.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.042
Like Seneca,

01:03:52.625 --> 01:03:54.292
he bled to death in the bathtub.

01:03:57.458 --> 01:03:59.042
One of the few times he'd ever...

01:03:59.625 --> 01:04:00.792
sat in one.

01:04:14.250 --> 01:04:16.125
Now, old Junius Junior...

01:04:16.208 --> 01:04:17.458
Yeah, he...

01:04:18.458 --> 01:04:21.167
he really made it into high society.
Piss-elegant.

01:04:22.750 --> 01:04:24.208
"Blazing the trail for the...

01:04:24.750 --> 01:04:26.208
Kellys and the Kennedys."

01:04:26.292 --> 01:04:29.542
Otterlake, the human tape recorder.

01:04:30.833 --> 01:04:33.583
That'sÂ me, Skipper. That's me.

01:04:38.625 --> 01:04:39.625
Then...

01:04:41.333 --> 01:04:43.042
you know about the chandelier.

01:04:49.458 --> 01:04:50.500
I'm the authority.

01:04:52.667 --> 01:04:55.125
The old Hollywood Hotel, wasn't it?

01:05:07.333 --> 01:05:09.208
They found him one Sunday morning.

01:05:12.208 --> 01:05:13.208
Hanging from it.

01:05:17.375 --> 01:05:19.833
After which, you had to go to work
for a living.

01:05:22.167 --> 01:05:23.625
So, what do you do next?

01:05:25.333 --> 01:05:26.708
What does anybody do?

01:05:34.750 --> 01:05:37.375
And he's on all the credits
of Jake's screenplays.

01:05:37.458 --> 01:05:38.500
Right?

01:05:38.625 --> 01:05:40.167
I amuse Mr. Hannaford.

01:05:40.667 --> 01:05:41.958
He has curious pleasures.

01:05:42.875 --> 01:05:45.250
Games, he likes to play games.

01:05:45.958 --> 01:05:47.500
I'm a writer who stopped writing

01:05:47.583 --> 01:05:50.167
one afternoon in Budapest
in 1929.

01:05:51.333 --> 01:05:52.375
Do you have a camera?

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:59.417
I'm prepared to make
a limited declaration.

01:06:01.083 --> 01:06:02.208
This famous...

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:04.458
old lion of yours,

01:06:05.292 --> 01:06:06.875
is not what you think, you know?

01:06:06.958 --> 01:06:08.292
Lions are cats.

01:06:08.708 --> 01:06:10.625
And Jake, my dear, is a cat.

01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:13.208
A cat that walks like a bear.

01:06:13.542 --> 01:06:15.417
I'd call him a necromancer.

01:06:16.583 --> 01:06:19.375
But I do not know if he's raised the dead.

01:06:28.542 --> 01:06:29.625
There you are.

01:06:30.042 --> 01:06:32.333
Yes. This gentleman...

01:06:32.625 --> 01:06:33.833
kindly gave me...

01:06:36.042 --> 01:06:38.083
Just stay there. Do you mind?

01:06:38.958 --> 01:06:39.958
Mind?

01:06:40.833 --> 01:06:42.583
No, not at all.

01:06:52.583 --> 01:06:53.792
<i>Here she comes again.</i>

01:07:01.750 --> 01:07:03.042
<i>Push him down, dear.</i>

01:07:05.750 --> 01:07:08.583
<i>Hold him down, choke him,
drive that tongue in his throat.</i>

01:07:08.667 --> 01:07:09.667
<i>Choke him.</i>

01:07:11.333 --> 01:07:12.417
<i>Alright, sweetie.</i>

01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:13.583
<i>You know where to go.</i>

01:07:13.708 --> 01:07:14.750
<i>Let's have that tongue.</i>

01:07:14.833 --> 01:07:15.917
<i>Let's see it.</i>

01:07:32.375 --> 01:07:34.625
<i>Come on, sweetie. Slowly.</i>

01:07:37.792 --> 01:07:38.917
<i>Slow...</i>

01:07:51.542 --> 01:07:52.958
<i>Yeah. Go on.</i>

01:07:53.417 --> 01:07:54.417
<i>Kid!</i>

01:07:54.625 --> 01:07:56.083
<i>Listen, kid.</i>

01:07:56.167 --> 01:07:58.042
<i>Now you're getting your courage up.</i>

01:08:02.250 --> 01:08:03.417
<i>Are you getting it up,</i>

01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:05.375
<i>or are we fresh out of courage, kid?</i>

01:08:07.417 --> 01:08:09.333
<i>Okay. Now the necklace is caught in it.</i>

01:08:10.250 --> 01:08:11.958
<i>Give us the reaction, John.</i>

01:08:22.917 --> 01:08:25.250
<i>You've got to believe this could happen.</i>

01:08:25.667 --> 01:08:28.417
<i>What if the truth isn't
so goddamned impressive?</i>

01:08:28.542 --> 01:08:29.542
<i>That's our secret.</i>

01:08:30.042 --> 01:08:31.042
<i>Scissors.</i>

01:08:35.250 --> 01:08:36.750
<i>Now she's going to cut it away.</i>

01:08:40.082 --> 01:08:41.207
<i>Snip, snip.</i>

01:08:43.957 --> 01:08:45.000
<i>Snippety...</i>

01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:46.500
<i>Cut.</i>

01:08:49.292 --> 01:08:50.582
<i>What has she cut, kid?</i>

01:08:50.957 --> 01:08:52.625
<i>Your little jewels, Johnny, or...</i>

01:08:53.667 --> 01:08:54.667
<i>hers?</i>

01:08:54.750 --> 01:08:57.500
<i>Let's feel that suspense, shall we?
Come on, honey. Feel it.</i>

01:08:57.957 --> 01:08:58.957
<i>Suspense, baby.</i>

01:08:59.250 --> 01:09:00.542
<i>Pure Hitchcock.</i>

01:09:00.625 --> 01:09:02.750
<i>If you'll pardon my language, sweetie.</i>

01:09:02.832 --> 01:09:04.167
<i>Hold still, Johnny.</i>

01:09:04.707 --> 01:09:06.292
<i>You can do that, can't you?</i>

01:09:08.542 --> 01:09:10.500
- Is that a cut?
- <i>Keep it rolling.</i>

01:09:11.542 --> 01:09:12.542
<i>Follow him.</i>

01:09:14.292 --> 01:09:15.957
<i>Hold on him and keep rolling.</i>

01:09:16.042 --> 01:09:18.375
He said keep rolling.
Everybody, keep rolling.

01:09:18.457 --> 01:09:19.457
<i>Both cameras.</i>

01:09:19.750 --> 01:09:21.000
<i>I'd like a record of this.</i>

01:09:21.082 --> 01:09:23.832
<i>That's it. Hold it on him.
And goodbye, Johnny Dale.</i>

01:09:33.207 --> 01:09:34.832
Hey, look what you dropped.

01:09:35.082 --> 01:09:37.500
Fifteen precious minutes of Hannaford.

01:09:37.582 --> 01:09:39.750
Every little bit
added to what we've got

01:09:39.832 --> 01:09:42.167
makes it just that much more.

01:09:43.167 --> 01:09:46.000
- What happened to the lights?
- I told them those spots were too much.

01:09:46.082 --> 01:09:47.582
Where's the circuit breaker?

01:09:47.667 --> 01:09:49.957
- What's a circuit breaker?
- I'm pulling on...

01:09:51.707 --> 01:09:53.832
- Not again.
- Excuse me. I'm sorry.

01:09:54.792 --> 01:09:57.167
- We are blacked out for good.
- Excuse me.

01:09:59.375 --> 01:10:02.208
Just watch the birthrate
nine months from tonight.

01:10:02.417 --> 01:10:04.833
What happened?
Did that jenny break down again?

01:10:05.333 --> 01:10:06.208
Twice in one night.

01:10:06.292 --> 01:10:08.583
- This is no accident, it's sabotage.
- Good heavens.

01:10:08.667 --> 01:10:11.417
Who do you suspect? This cineaste?

01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:13.625
He wouldn't know a cineaste
from a hole in the ground.

01:10:13.708 --> 01:10:15.250
Probably a midget with a grudge.

01:10:15.917 --> 01:10:17.042
I saw your film.

01:10:17.417 --> 01:10:19.208
You won't see any more of it tonight.

01:10:19.292 --> 01:10:20.375
Why not?

01:10:20.542 --> 01:10:22.958
No lights, no projection, dumb-dumb.

01:10:23.042 --> 01:10:25.792
- Excuse me.
- Besides, I didn't make it.

01:10:25.958 --> 01:10:27.792
You will, kid. You will.

01:10:28.458 --> 01:10:31.833
- Let me tell you what I thought of it.
- Get us a drink, will you, sweetie?

01:10:32.500 --> 01:10:34.292
Just look for Jake Hannaford.

01:10:34.375 --> 01:10:35.625
He glows in the dark.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:37.333
Right, Brooksie?

01:10:38.083 --> 01:10:39.875
What you imitate is him.

01:10:40.458 --> 01:10:43.167
The man, not the movies.
Your idea of him.

01:10:43.667 --> 01:10:46.125
You know, the bullfights
and the big game,

01:10:46.208 --> 01:10:47.625
the whole macho bit.

01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:49.833
No, the truth of the matter is...

01:10:50.417 --> 01:10:51.833
that as a macho,

01:10:52.125 --> 01:10:53.292
he ain't all that much.

01:10:53.583 --> 01:10:57.000
That chest ain't near as hairy
as he'd like you to think.

01:10:57.792 --> 01:10:58.792
Yeah.

01:10:58.917 --> 01:11:02.125
Your guy's a big, pink lobster.

01:11:02.750 --> 01:11:03.917
Nothing's really tough.

01:11:04.375 --> 01:11:05.625
Except the shell.

01:11:06.083 --> 01:11:07.083
Now what?

01:11:07.375 --> 01:11:09.000
I ask you what's so tough about you,

01:11:09.083 --> 01:11:11.708
and you ask me if I wouldn't
like to find out, then we

01:11:11.792 --> 01:11:15.042
entertain the folks with a good,
old-fashioned Hollywood fist fight?

01:11:15.125 --> 01:11:16.125
Well...

01:11:18.083 --> 01:11:19.833
If that's the way you want it, kid.

01:11:19.917 --> 01:11:21.750
Old fashioned is the word, alright,

01:11:22.125 --> 01:11:23.708
even in the way you do Hannaford.

01:11:23.833 --> 01:11:26.333
Maybe he was like that 30 years ago.

01:11:26.583 --> 01:11:28.667
I'll give him 40 years.

01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:32.167
My Jake can still lick the shit
out of yours.

01:11:37.417 --> 01:11:40.125
- What the hell did you do that for?
- I wasn't even here.

01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:41.958
This is all going on film, you know.

01:11:44.083 --> 01:11:45.750
Come on, get him out of here.

01:11:52.292 --> 01:11:55.458
Putting a little extra zing
on the lobster's claw, Brooksie.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:57.250
I'd do the same for you.

01:11:57.333 --> 01:11:59.167
We imitation Hannafords...

01:11:59.542 --> 01:12:01.042
have got to stick together.

01:12:01.250 --> 01:12:03.875
I brought that schoolteacher.
Remember?

01:12:04.458 --> 01:12:06.167
You were supposed
to bring Max David.

01:12:06.250 --> 01:12:08.667
Jake, I've got to talk to you about that.

01:12:12.708 --> 01:12:13.708
No sweat.

01:12:13.875 --> 01:12:16.667
A couple of wranglers will take him
to the local first aid.

01:12:16.833 --> 01:12:18.250
You think it'll be alright?

01:12:18.667 --> 01:12:19.667
Sure.

01:12:19.750 --> 01:12:22.375
We'll donate his motorcycle to charity.

01:12:23.333 --> 01:12:25.917
Please, if you're going to have a fight,
invite me.

01:12:30.250 --> 01:12:32.000
Who told you I was broke?

01:12:37.667 --> 01:12:38.667
Well...

01:12:39.542 --> 01:12:41.917
Billy said you sold the boat.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.833
He did, did he?
How about the roof over my head?

01:12:45.208 --> 01:12:46.542
How does that grab you?

01:12:46.667 --> 01:12:47.917
You mean the ranch?

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:49.208
Out in the snow, kid.

01:12:49.917 --> 01:12:51.917
Over the hill and down dale.

01:12:53.042 --> 01:12:56.792
But let's not ever speak
of Master John Dale again.

01:13:03.083 --> 01:13:04.083
Dale.

01:13:05.250 --> 01:13:06.250
Dale.

01:13:06.375 --> 01:13:08.875
That's what really bugs you,
isn't it? Dale.

01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:12.167
Of all your troubles,
what's one lousy leading man?

01:13:12.917 --> 01:13:16.875
Less than the dust beneath
my chariot wheels.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:22.542
Jesus, I'll drink to that.

01:13:34.833 --> 01:13:37.042
Is that for me? Thank you, Billy.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:45.125
Pass it on.

01:13:45.917 --> 01:13:46.917
Right on.

01:14:06.625 --> 01:14:07.625
Billy.

01:14:08.417 --> 01:14:09.458
Hey.

01:14:10.292 --> 01:14:12.167
What are you doing, Billy? Smoking?

01:14:12.250 --> 01:14:13.458
What does it look like?

01:14:13.542 --> 01:14:16.417
The way things are going tonight,
it could be a reefer.

01:14:16.500 --> 01:14:18.292
Nowadays, we call it a joint.

01:14:18.375 --> 01:14:21.292
What do you need tea for,
you got gum drops.

01:14:21.875 --> 01:14:22.958
We know.

01:14:23.333 --> 01:14:24.833
That's to keep you off the juice.

01:14:26.708 --> 01:14:27.875
He wants to see you.

01:14:28.292 --> 01:14:29.292
Yeah?

01:14:31.125 --> 01:14:32.667
I want to see him.

01:14:32.750 --> 01:14:34.875
- I've got that teacher waiting...
- Get on out there.

01:14:34.958 --> 01:14:36.417
Guess who joined us?

01:14:36.542 --> 01:14:37.625
Herman the German.

01:14:37.708 --> 01:14:38.708
Hermie?

01:14:40.292 --> 01:14:42.250
How's the boy? And you, Billy?

01:14:42.333 --> 01:14:43.667
Jake, I just told you.

01:14:43.750 --> 01:14:46.750
Kept you busy just collecting
schoolteachers?

01:14:47.167 --> 01:14:49.958
Hey, can I please get myself
something to eat?

01:14:50.042 --> 01:14:52.625
I wasn't just collecting schoolteachers.

01:14:52.833 --> 01:14:54.250
Didn't they feed you?

01:14:54.375 --> 01:14:56.667
All they do on airplanes is feed you.

01:14:57.083 --> 01:14:58.083
Turbulence.

01:14:59.833 --> 01:15:00.833
You threw up.

01:15:01.875 --> 01:15:03.667
Give him some candy, Billy.

01:15:03.750 --> 01:15:06.875
- Jake, those oil guys...
- Keep the voices down.

01:15:07.208 --> 01:15:09.250
These freaks got the whole joint
wired for sound.

01:15:09.333 --> 01:15:11.458
I caught one of them bugging a cactus.

01:15:11.542 --> 01:15:12.833
What about the oil guys?

01:15:12.917 --> 01:15:15.292
Don't be bashful, Hermie.
We know the answer.

01:15:15.375 --> 01:15:16.542
They want no part of us.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:19.417
Neither does Max.

01:15:19.875 --> 01:15:21.542
- Right, Billy?
- No.

01:15:21.875 --> 01:15:23.167
Max David, that dirty crook.

01:15:23.250 --> 01:15:24.458
- Who needs him?
- We do.

01:15:24.542 --> 01:15:27.000
He's so crooked,
he's got rubber pockets

01:15:27.083 --> 01:15:28.917
so he can steal soup.

01:15:29.167 --> 01:15:31.000
Our best chance was that oil money.

01:15:31.375 --> 01:15:32.958
Otterlake, what about him?

01:15:33.208 --> 01:15:35.208
- Yeah, what about me?
- Brooksie.

01:15:35.500 --> 01:15:38.958
We wondered if you knew
about the screening at the drive-in.

01:15:39.042 --> 01:15:41.917
- We're screening the rest of the movie.
- He's seen the movie.

01:15:42.333 --> 01:15:43.458
Not everything.

01:15:45.042 --> 01:15:47.042
Well, we don't have everything.

01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:49.792
Leave it to Jake, pretty soon
you'll have too much.

01:15:50.083 --> 01:15:52.458
You bet, we've had our troubles before.

01:15:52.542 --> 01:15:55.000
Want your little friend
to get you a drink, Skipper?

01:15:55.083 --> 01:15:56.250
Thanks, Brooksie.

01:15:56.792 --> 01:16:00.458
- He's Max's golden-haired boy, isn't he?
- They gave Brooks his own company.

01:16:00.625 --> 01:16:02.667
Come on. Tell us something we don't know.

01:16:03.208 --> 01:16:05.000
I brought that schoolteacher.

01:16:05.125 --> 01:16:07.208
Jake will see him if and when
he feels like it.

01:16:07.292 --> 01:16:09.000
What about Max David?

01:16:09.167 --> 01:16:12.167
That's who you were to bring out here,
right after the screening.

01:16:12.250 --> 01:16:15.458
He blew it.
Must be all that candy he eats.

01:16:16.708 --> 01:16:17.708
Me?

01:16:19.208 --> 01:16:20.667
You were the one with Max.

01:16:21.500 --> 01:16:22.500
Where is he?

01:16:24.750 --> 01:16:27.333
And what the hell's the candy
got to do with it?

01:16:27.458 --> 01:16:29.250
Could be it's softening your brain,
Uncle.

01:16:29.333 --> 01:16:32.958
It's for the sugar. You know that.
Since I got off that stuff.

01:16:33.875 --> 01:16:35.542
Well, speaking of which...

01:16:37.583 --> 01:16:39.708
Speaking of which, here's little Mavis,

01:16:40.208 --> 01:16:42.208
who'll bring us a little
fresh encouragement.

01:16:42.750 --> 01:16:45.125
- Won't you, sweetie?
- Shouldn't I go home and pack?

01:16:45.208 --> 01:16:48.083
- Pack?
- I mean, if we're going to Mexico.

01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:50.500
We go as we are, sweetie.

01:16:50.833 --> 01:16:52.375
Just as we are.

01:17:01.375 --> 01:17:02.750
Wasn't very smart, you know.

01:17:03.583 --> 01:17:05.500
Poor-mouthing like that
in front of Otterlake.

01:17:05.583 --> 01:17:06.958
You know who he is, don't you?

01:17:07.750 --> 01:17:10.083
Of course I do. I've seen his pictures.

01:17:10.167 --> 01:17:11.333
He's a big success.

01:17:11.417 --> 01:17:14.042
Brooks Otterlake is money,
not just success, but money.

01:17:14.125 --> 01:17:16.208
His old man owns half the trees in Canada.

01:17:16.417 --> 01:17:18.708
Yes, and you know what Billy told him.

01:17:18.875 --> 01:17:20.708
He told him we're in trouble.

01:17:20.792 --> 01:17:21.875
Well, aren't we?

01:17:22.875 --> 01:17:25.500
When you talk poor to the rich,
they jump to conclusions.

01:17:25.583 --> 01:17:28.125
They think we're getting ready
for the touch.

01:17:28.208 --> 01:17:29.917
And that's what we're doing?

01:17:30.667 --> 01:17:34.167
Could have been the general idea
until Uncle Billy loused it up.

01:17:36.875 --> 01:17:39.250
Mr. Hannaford, excuse me...

01:17:39.542 --> 01:17:41.958
Didn't I just hear you saying
about Otterlake?

01:17:42.042 --> 01:17:43.500
No more questions, Junior.

01:17:43.583 --> 01:17:45.042
Where did this yo-yo come from?

01:17:45.125 --> 01:17:46.601
As it happens, I did one of the first

01:17:46.625 --> 01:17:49.042
really positive critical appraisals
of Brooks Otterlake.

01:17:49.125 --> 01:17:51.125
Hurray for you, buddy boy.

01:17:51.208 --> 01:17:53.292
I just want to be helpful.
From what I overheard,

01:17:53.375 --> 01:17:55.750
I understand there's some thought
of approaching him.

01:17:55.833 --> 01:17:57.667
A word from me certainly couldn't hurt.

01:17:57.750 --> 01:18:00.500
- He's bound to feel some gratitude...
- Mr. Otterlake's a chum.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:05.167
We don't hustle our chums for dough.
We're kind of strict about that.

01:18:05.250 --> 01:18:08.667
Always remember that your heart
is God's little garden.

01:18:10.125 --> 01:18:11.625
Is that recorder still running?

01:18:11.708 --> 01:18:13.208
- No.
- Well, see that it isn't.

01:18:13.292 --> 01:18:15.083
- There's a camera somewhere.
- Yeah?

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:17.000
A couple of them.

01:18:20.958 --> 01:18:23.375
Studying a man like Jake Hannaford.

01:18:23.458 --> 01:18:26.125
That's an experience. Don't you miss it.

01:18:26.208 --> 01:18:27.500
Stick with the job.

01:18:32.875 --> 01:18:35.167
Eat a little shit, Mr. Pister.

01:18:42.458 --> 01:18:43.292
Have fun.

01:18:43.375 --> 01:18:45.708
- What's that, Billy?
- That's the latest message.

01:18:45.792 --> 01:18:46.792
Roger.

01:18:46.833 --> 01:18:48.625
I did something I shouldn't have done.

01:19:00.250 --> 01:19:03.292
- But I saw him go into the library.
- It's groovier in here.

01:19:08.542 --> 01:19:09.542
Billy?

01:19:09.667 --> 01:19:10.667
What are you doing?

01:19:12.708 --> 01:19:13.542
Otterlake.

01:19:13.625 --> 01:19:15.708
For Christ's sake, Brooksie.

01:19:15.792 --> 01:19:17.792
You know about Billy.

01:19:18.250 --> 01:19:21.000
He's been on the program for nine years.

01:19:21.167 --> 01:19:23.375
- Why did you want to do that?
- What is the fundamental

01:19:23.458 --> 01:19:26.375
aesthetic distinction between a zoom
and a dolly?

01:19:27.667 --> 01:19:31.500
What possible difference can that make
except to another dolly?

01:19:33.917 --> 01:19:35.542
- Forget it.
- What?

01:19:38.167 --> 01:19:39.167
Hi.

01:19:47.500 --> 01:19:49.875
This is the one that hurts, Brooksie.

01:19:52.333 --> 01:19:53.333
Skipper...

01:19:54.750 --> 01:19:57.333
This is a scene we both hoped
we'd never get to.

01:19:58.667 --> 01:20:00.292
I don't think it's going to play.

01:20:01.083 --> 01:20:02.667
Not even for comedy.

01:20:08.500 --> 01:20:09.542
How much do you need?

01:20:11.875 --> 01:20:13.333
How much have you got?

01:20:15.750 --> 01:20:16.750
Hey.

01:20:16.875 --> 01:20:20.292
Remember when you first appeared
on that location of mine out in Iran?

01:20:20.375 --> 01:20:23.333
I didn't even have fare back home.

01:20:23.458 --> 01:20:24.458
Just that...

01:20:25.250 --> 01:20:26.708
secondhand tape recorder.

01:20:26.792 --> 01:20:28.208
A raggedy-ass kid.

01:20:28.917 --> 01:20:29.917
When was it?

01:20:30.125 --> 01:20:32.625
Only... four years ago.

01:20:32.875 --> 01:20:33.875
Skipper?

01:20:34.583 --> 01:20:35.583
Yes.

01:20:36.458 --> 01:20:37.458
That...

01:20:38.250 --> 01:20:39.583
forty million that was...

01:20:40.292 --> 01:20:41.292
mentioned...

01:20:46.292 --> 01:20:47.292
I know, kid.

01:20:49.958 --> 01:20:51.667
It's only a distant hope.

01:20:52.458 --> 01:20:53.667
How's that for dialogue?

01:20:56.750 --> 01:20:58.000
Tell you what, Brooksie...

01:20:58.667 --> 01:21:01.917
You might just lean a little on...
Max David.

01:21:02.708 --> 01:21:04.167
You do the leaning,

01:21:04.667 --> 01:21:05.958
he's got to give.

01:21:06.667 --> 01:21:09.667
- I did set up the screening.
- So you did, Brooksie.

01:21:10.375 --> 01:21:12.042
And he hated every frame.

01:21:12.292 --> 01:21:14.375
He's an idiot, Jake. They're all idiots.

01:21:14.458 --> 01:21:15.583
You know that.

01:21:15.667 --> 01:21:16.750
He's your idiot.

01:21:16.833 --> 01:21:18.167
Up to a point.

01:21:19.083 --> 01:21:20.542
Don't be pompous, Brooksie.

01:21:21.125 --> 01:21:23.583
You made his company all that loot.

01:21:24.542 --> 01:21:25.833
Christ knows I didn't.

01:21:25.917 --> 01:21:28.375
Don't think I'm not ready
to put up a fight for you.

01:21:28.875 --> 01:21:30.708
Want me to spare you the embarrassment?

01:21:31.125 --> 01:21:32.333
It's you I'm thinking of.

01:21:32.417 --> 01:21:34.750
I don't want to have to listen
to Max David...

01:21:35.542 --> 01:21:36.792
and all those stupid...

01:21:38.167 --> 01:21:39.625
Turning you down.

01:21:41.042 --> 01:21:43.708
Don't give up the ship, eh, Brooksie?

01:21:43.792 --> 01:21:44.917
I'm not.

01:21:49.792 --> 01:21:51.917
I told you this wouldn't play.

01:21:55.250 --> 01:21:56.625
You alright, Zimmie?

01:21:57.833 --> 01:21:59.042
Sure.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.667
Don't worry about me.
You've got troubles of your own.

01:22:02.917 --> 01:22:04.333
Jesus, all this TV.

01:22:04.417 --> 01:22:07.292
There must be plenty of work
for a good makeup man.

01:22:07.375 --> 01:22:08.583
I got a suggestion.

01:22:08.917 --> 01:22:09.750
Yeah?

01:22:09.833 --> 01:22:13.792
- It's what you can do with them dummies.
- I know what I can do with them.

01:22:13.875 --> 01:22:16.667
Listen, Pat.
You take them dummies, see,

01:22:16.958 --> 01:22:19.208
and you take this piece of iron pipe,

01:22:19.625 --> 01:22:24.208
and you slash and beat and chop away
to your heart's content.

01:22:25.833 --> 01:22:28.167
Or maybe give the pop to Jake.

01:22:28.917 --> 01:22:31.792
He'd feel a whole lot better off
afterwards, believe me.

01:22:32.417 --> 01:22:33.833
The state requires you...?

01:22:35.083 --> 01:22:36.625
Yes, every state does.

01:22:36.958 --> 01:22:39.375
- So, in order to graduate by January...
- Here we are.

01:22:39.500 --> 01:22:41.708
...I'd have to take one
correspondence course.

01:22:41.833 --> 01:22:44.042
- Well.
- Mr. Hannaford...

01:22:44.125 --> 01:22:46.708
You have two more credits to go before...

01:22:46.792 --> 01:22:48.917
- Mr. Hannaford.
- Which is civics and economics.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:50.917
- She won't pay that?
- She won't sign for it.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:52.083
Mr. Hannaford?

01:22:54.083 --> 01:22:56.583
Dr. Bradley Pierce Burroughs.

01:22:57.083 --> 01:22:58.083
Pease.

01:22:59.042 --> 01:23:01.958
- Pease?
- Bradley Pease Burroughs.

01:23:05.875 --> 01:23:08.417
Not that it matters. How do you, sir?

01:23:09.875 --> 01:23:10.875
Here you go.

01:23:11.292 --> 01:23:12.292
May I take your...?

01:23:12.375 --> 01:23:13.708
Yes. Thank you.

01:23:26.083 --> 01:23:28.333
The doc here is professor
of English Literature

01:23:28.417 --> 01:23:32.625
at the Franahan Boarding Academy
for Boys.

01:23:33.167 --> 01:23:34.167
Clivedale.

01:23:38.333 --> 01:23:42.417
- That's the name of the school.
- He also teaches Dramatics.

01:23:44.667 --> 01:23:47.375
And who do you think was my star pupil?

01:23:47.875 --> 01:23:50.208
Of course, we knew him then as, Oscar.

01:23:53.542 --> 01:23:54.542
Oscar.

01:23:55.792 --> 01:23:58.333
Tell about Aunt Daisy with the funny hats.

01:24:01.167 --> 01:24:04.333
- They weren't... that funny.
- She raised him, so you said.

01:24:04.875 --> 01:24:07.792
And from the time he was able to walk,

01:24:08.083 --> 01:24:09.083
he used to put on shows.

01:24:09.125 --> 01:24:12.875
You know, with his auntie's hats
and gowns and dresses.

01:24:14.042 --> 01:24:16.917
The way Dale tells it,
he didn't even want to be an actor.

01:24:17.333 --> 01:24:21.083
Supposedly Jake's idea.
He practically forced him into it.

01:24:22.083 --> 01:24:23.542
What was he doing...

01:24:24.542 --> 01:24:27.417
in Acapulco, besides getting stoned?

01:24:29.458 --> 01:24:31.333
He made the trip just to see you.

01:24:48.167 --> 01:24:49.167
Does all this matter?

01:24:50.625 --> 01:24:51.958
I think it does to Jake.

01:24:52.708 --> 01:24:54.000
Oh, Christ.

01:25:01.792 --> 01:25:02.958
And the change of name?

01:25:03.042 --> 01:25:04.250
For that,

01:25:04.333 --> 01:25:06.792
I'm afraid we have to blame Oscar Wilde.

01:25:14.917 --> 01:25:15.917
We had this...

01:25:16.625 --> 01:25:17.625
Yeah.

01:25:18.042 --> 01:25:20.917
There was an unpleasant little...

01:25:26.792 --> 01:25:28.375
You see there was this...

01:25:29.792 --> 01:25:31.000
We had this teacher.

01:25:32.500 --> 01:25:34.042
He was just one of those little...

01:25:34.125 --> 01:25:35.125
You mean he was a faggot.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:38.500
This teacher was a faggot.

01:25:40.208 --> 01:25:41.208
Well.

01:25:50.375 --> 01:25:51.375
Mr. Hannaford...

01:25:57.917 --> 01:26:00.292
This story concerns my school.

01:26:00.875 --> 01:26:03.708
I'm in no position to...

01:26:05.083 --> 01:26:07.292
- publish...
- Publish and be damned.

01:26:08.583 --> 01:26:10.833
Look. We've run out of film.

01:26:11.667 --> 01:26:13.708
You can speak off the record.

01:26:15.333 --> 01:26:18.250
Dale was in no way involved, you know.

01:26:18.667 --> 01:26:21.500
But... among the boys, there was a...

01:26:22.083 --> 01:26:25.167
great deal of morbid conversation,

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:27.917
I'm afraid, on unhealthy subjects.

01:26:30.083 --> 01:26:33.875
As you could imagine,
with a name like Oscar.

01:26:35.042 --> 01:26:36.667
What happened to that teacher?

01:26:37.333 --> 01:26:39.583
- We let him go, of course.
- Let him go?

01:26:40.667 --> 01:26:41.792
What about the police?

01:26:43.875 --> 01:26:47.333
- The man was sick, Mr. Hannaford.
- But those young boys.

01:26:47.833 --> 01:26:49.913
They must have been sick
after he finished with them.

01:26:50.417 --> 01:26:52.958
I hope you're not worried about Dale.

01:26:54.458 --> 01:26:55.833
You think I should be?

01:26:56.458 --> 01:26:59.083
Wouldn't that depend, Mr. Hannaford,
on your own...

01:26:59.167 --> 01:27:00.292
personal interest?

01:27:05.792 --> 01:27:08.042
What are you driving at, Dr. Burroughs?

01:27:08.125 --> 01:27:09.125
Nothing.

01:27:14.875 --> 01:27:15.875
Nothing.

01:27:19.125 --> 01:27:22.000
I'm just his director, not his Aunt Daisy.

01:27:22.208 --> 01:27:23.750
And I'm just his English teacher.

01:27:32.833 --> 01:27:35.583
Certainly, he has every reason to be
grateful to you.

01:27:35.667 --> 01:27:38.042
I'm sure that one day, when one
of his fine performances

01:27:38.125 --> 01:27:39.417
gets the Academy Award,

01:27:39.500 --> 01:27:40.708
you'll be grateful to him.

01:27:41.417 --> 01:27:44.500
Notice how careful he is not to refer
to it as an Oscar.

01:27:50.958 --> 01:27:53.125
Would you like to take a dip,
Dr. Burroughs?

01:27:53.625 --> 01:27:54.625
A dip?

01:27:55.792 --> 01:27:57.083
The pool!

01:27:57.208 --> 01:27:59.417
What a grand suggestion.

01:28:00.458 --> 01:28:03.583
A little more hooch would be helpful.
I'll be right with you.

01:28:04.375 --> 01:28:05.750
Good.

01:28:16.167 --> 01:28:17.375
Where do I change?

01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:18.500
Right here.

01:28:19.167 --> 01:28:20.458
In the sight of God.

01:28:24.625 --> 01:28:26.333
We all promise not to look.

01:28:34.458 --> 01:28:37.917
Yes, I suppose all schoolteachers
are prigs.

01:28:38.167 --> 01:28:39.333
I suppose.

01:28:40.250 --> 01:28:42.125
Prigs or faggots.

01:28:42.250 --> 01:28:44.333
Now, now, Mr. Hannaford.

01:28:44.417 --> 01:28:46.708
Now, now, Dr. Burroughs.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:58.500
We were conned, Mother.

01:28:59.792 --> 01:29:00.792
He was a fake.

01:29:01.417 --> 01:29:03.042
She knows the way they met.

01:29:03.125 --> 01:29:06.042
When Mr. John Dale was pulled
out of the water,

01:29:06.125 --> 01:29:08.042
the famous would-be suicide.

01:29:08.208 --> 01:29:09.542
"Would-be suicide?"

01:29:09.917 --> 01:29:11.833
I'm bored with the whole story.

01:29:12.708 --> 01:29:15.417
Would-be suicides ought to be
treated like drunks.

01:29:18.625 --> 01:29:20.542
Turns out he doesn't belong to you.

01:29:20.625 --> 01:29:21.625
Belong?

01:29:22.167 --> 01:29:23.917
The old Chinese business, remember?

01:29:25.042 --> 01:29:28.000
You save a life, you own that life.

01:29:28.417 --> 01:29:30.917
- Finders keepers?
- Jake isn't a Chinaman.

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:34.542
- And Dale wasn't no suicide.
- No, he was an actor.

01:29:34.625 --> 01:29:36.542
And he wasn't drowning,
he was auditioning.

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.292
Jake, that boy didn't run away.

01:29:39.917 --> 01:29:41.125
He was thrown away.

01:29:41.500 --> 01:29:42.333
Yes, Mother.

01:29:42.417 --> 01:29:45.000
And sweet, holy Jesus.
What a relief that was.

01:29:45.083 --> 01:29:48.583
Like getting rid of an aching tooth
or the monkey off your back.

01:29:49.250 --> 01:29:51.292
A drug habit is something you've
got to kick.

01:29:51.625 --> 01:29:53.750
Yes, and my foot was getting sore.

01:29:55.208 --> 01:29:56.625
How are you going to finish it?

01:29:56.708 --> 01:29:59.375
That boy is all washed up, Miss Valeska.

01:29:59.708 --> 01:30:01.792
The picture.
Isn't that what matters?

01:30:02.375 --> 01:30:04.292
We've got that footage

01:30:04.375 --> 01:30:06.875
of him bringing the clothes to her

01:30:06.958 --> 01:30:08.125
in all that wind.

01:30:08.500 --> 01:30:10.208
- Right, Maggie?
- To the girl?

01:30:10.833 --> 01:30:11.833
What then?

01:30:12.083 --> 01:30:14.208
The girl. What about her?

01:30:14.500 --> 01:30:16.083
Yes, what about her?

01:30:16.292 --> 01:30:17.583
We're all interested.

01:30:17.833 --> 01:30:18.833
Dale wasn't.

01:30:19.500 --> 01:30:21.292
And neither is Mr. Hannaford.

01:30:21.792 --> 01:30:23.042
That's funny, isn't it?

01:30:23.708 --> 01:30:24.750
A scream.

01:30:24.833 --> 01:30:26.583
I'd just like to ask Mr. Hannaford

01:30:26.667 --> 01:30:29.833
if things wouldn't have been
very different if Dale had been her lover?

01:30:30.667 --> 01:30:31.917
If they weren't lovers,

01:30:32.500 --> 01:30:34.542
doesn't that sort of spoil the pattern?

01:30:35.250 --> 01:30:37.375
- Miss Rich.
- She's on again.

01:30:38.250 --> 01:30:39.375
You ask him.

01:30:44.250 --> 01:30:46.833
- Why don't you get lost, buster?
- Tonight,

01:30:46.958 --> 01:30:48.458
it's all on the record.

01:30:49.250 --> 01:30:50.500
It's all hanging out.

01:30:50.625 --> 01:30:52.167
That's how Zarah wants it.

01:30:52.250 --> 01:30:55.208
- Here's a present for you.
- The truth shall set us free.

01:30:55.292 --> 01:30:57.625
- Not from me, from Zimmie.
- Zimmie?

01:30:57.958 --> 01:30:59.167
There's a card with it.

01:30:59.250 --> 01:31:01.708
- We ought to have a drink with Zimmie.
- You fired him.

01:31:02.458 --> 01:31:03.708
I always fire Zimmie.

01:31:04.042 --> 01:31:05.208
I fire Zimmie constantly.

01:31:05.708 --> 01:31:07.417
Anyway, it's my birthday.

01:31:08.083 --> 01:31:09.542
I always give the presents.

01:31:09.833 --> 01:31:12.250
- That's some kind of a gag.
- We know.

01:31:13.083 --> 01:31:14.833
He makes the gags too.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:17.917
Did he tell you where I should stick it?

01:31:18.458 --> 01:31:19.625
Zimmie's jokes.

01:31:20.250 --> 01:31:24.667
Just in case you want to use it on those
dummy John Dales he made for you.

01:31:25.250 --> 01:31:26.333
Speaking of presents...

01:31:27.333 --> 01:31:28.958
Have I got a present.

01:31:29.792 --> 01:31:31.708
Have a go at the dummies, Jake.

01:31:31.958 --> 01:31:34.000
They break even more easily than people.

01:31:42.917 --> 01:31:43.917
Gentlemen.

01:31:46.917 --> 01:31:47.917
Ladies.

01:31:49.125 --> 01:31:50.875
We are presenting an award

01:31:50.958 --> 01:31:54.125
to the other half of
<i>The Other Side of the Wind.</i>

01:31:54.708 --> 01:31:56.458
The better half.

01:31:56.875 --> 01:31:58.125
A bone...

01:31:58.792 --> 01:31:59.792
for Pocahontas.

01:32:00.583 --> 01:32:03.167
A little curio we picked up somewhere.

01:32:03.917 --> 01:32:07.833
A bit of our own pale-faced craftsmanship.

01:32:08.792 --> 01:32:10.458
Indian bone.

01:32:11.458 --> 01:32:16.125
The inscription goes back to before
all this was movie country.

01:32:16.917 --> 01:32:19.667
Just after gold was found,

01:32:19.875 --> 01:32:22.333
the Indian populationÂ dropped
pretty quickly.

01:32:22.708 --> 01:32:24.333
And in ten years,

01:32:24.417 --> 01:32:28.542
about ninety thousand of them...
just disappeared.

01:32:29.333 --> 01:32:32.000
Well, in those good old days,

01:32:32.125 --> 01:32:34.667
our gallant honkey pioneers

01:32:35.500 --> 01:32:41.083
used to cut off Indian ears
and pickle them in whiskey, for souvenirs.

01:32:42.792 --> 01:32:45.250
And on pieces of bone, like this,

01:32:45.708 --> 01:32:48.333
they'd write funny little jokes.

01:32:49.083 --> 01:32:51.167
"I am off the reservation...

01:32:51.708 --> 01:32:53.083
at last."

01:32:55.500 --> 01:32:56.958
And so are you, my dear.

01:32:58.125 --> 01:33:00.833
Perhaps you'd like to present this
to our leading man.

01:33:01.875 --> 01:33:03.500
Right up his ass.

01:33:11.333 --> 01:33:12.667
The old man is a destroyer.

01:33:12.750 --> 01:33:15.125
What he creates, he has to wreck.
It's a compulsion.

01:33:15.542 --> 01:33:18.542
Then we must wait, my dear,
for him to eat us alive.

01:33:18.875 --> 01:33:21.417
Unless, perhaps you are a critic.

01:33:21.792 --> 01:33:24.500
He does tend to rather push them
to the side of his plate.

01:33:25.792 --> 01:33:26.792
But others...

01:33:27.625 --> 01:33:30.292
we who glow a little in his light,

01:33:31.083 --> 01:33:34.375
- the fireflies...
- Fireflies, I'll drink to that.

01:33:34.458 --> 01:33:37.083
...he does quite often swallow whole.

01:33:38.500 --> 01:33:39.583
It is a fact,

01:33:40.333 --> 01:33:44.000
that some of us, he chews on
rather slowly.

01:33:44.542 --> 01:33:46.625
And you wouldn't call him a destroyer?

01:33:47.208 --> 01:33:48.625
I withdraw the aphorism,

01:33:48.708 --> 01:33:52.542
and give you in its place,
a simple law of physics.

01:33:54.125 --> 01:33:59.000
No machine ever produces
as much as it consumes.

01:33:59.333 --> 01:34:02.417
<i>And everybody was happy
until they found him one Sunday morning</i>

01:34:02.500 --> 01:34:04.667
<i>in his suite in the old Hollywood Hotel,</i>

01:34:05.292 --> 01:34:07.125
<i>hanging from a chandelier.</i>

01:34:41.375 --> 01:34:42.625
Early morning,

01:34:43.875 --> 01:34:45.208
just before dawn.

01:34:46.667 --> 01:34:47.667
Not yet.

01:34:48.708 --> 01:34:50.125
Flashback, Mavis.

01:34:51.250 --> 01:34:53.917
An old fashioned flashback.

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:56.417
We're out on the boat.

01:34:57.042 --> 01:35:00.042
And we just happen to notice
somebody drowning.

01:35:00.958 --> 01:35:04.208
Trying to.
A young punk nobody ever heard of.

01:35:05.167 --> 01:35:06.167
John Dale.

01:35:07.708 --> 01:35:09.167
They've heard of him now.

01:35:09.250 --> 01:35:10.417
Yes.

01:35:11.250 --> 01:35:12.250
How's this?

01:35:12.292 --> 01:35:13.292
After we dried him out

01:35:13.375 --> 01:35:15.833
we tried to get him interested
in staying dry, but no.

01:35:16.500 --> 01:35:18.000
We know the story.

01:35:18.625 --> 01:35:19.625
Backwards.

01:35:20.958 --> 01:35:23.000
I just can't get him
interested in anything.

01:35:23.833 --> 01:35:26.917
Put me in a movie, make me a movie star.

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:28.375
What does that prove?

01:35:32.042 --> 01:35:33.583
What does it prove, Mavis?

01:35:35.542 --> 01:35:36.875
Bores him to death.

01:35:39.667 --> 01:35:42.167
But he stops trying to die.
I cured him of that.

01:35:42.500 --> 01:35:44.708
Master Johnny just...

01:35:45.042 --> 01:35:48.208
kicks me sharply in the groin,

01:35:48.292 --> 01:35:50.375
and walks away.

01:35:53.250 --> 01:35:54.250
Suicide.

01:35:55.375 --> 01:35:57.792
We were speaking of suicides.

01:36:09.125 --> 01:36:11.042
Want me to bring you another scotch?

01:36:24.125 --> 01:36:25.125
Well?

01:36:27.875 --> 01:36:29.792
What can I do for you, Miss Rich?

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.125
You could tell me what's going on here.

01:36:32.333 --> 01:36:35.583
- Or why.
- I wouldn't even begin to try.

01:36:36.833 --> 01:36:39.500
After Monday,
I won't have to worry about it.

01:36:39.958 --> 01:36:41.167
What does that mean?

01:36:42.083 --> 01:36:43.083
Guess.

01:36:43.875 --> 01:36:44.875
I don't want to.

01:36:45.750 --> 01:36:47.542
It sounds like you are quitting.

01:36:50.042 --> 01:36:51.333
You wouldn't do that.

01:36:52.083 --> 01:36:53.583
It's Chapter 11.

01:36:54.542 --> 01:36:55.583
We're finished.

01:36:56.792 --> 01:36:57.875
See you around.

01:36:58.542 --> 01:36:59.625
Where's Matt?

01:36:59.708 --> 01:37:02.292
He's got that meeting with the bankers
in New York,

01:37:02.375 --> 01:37:04.208
so he's going straight to the airport.

01:37:04.292 --> 01:37:06.708
He was supposed to fix it with
the drive-in theater.

01:37:06.792 --> 01:37:09.167
For the screening?
Yeah, he's stopping there first.

01:37:09.792 --> 01:37:12.875
Good. But Jake said we shouldn't
tell too many people.

01:37:13.542 --> 01:37:14.542
I won't.

01:37:14.583 --> 01:37:17.292
There ain't much left of this party
as it is.

01:37:21.208 --> 01:37:22.208
Jesus.

01:37:22.792 --> 01:37:24.833
Up with the fireflies, eh, Billy?

01:37:24.917 --> 01:37:25.917
Right on.

01:37:26.750 --> 01:37:28.500
<i>Shine little glow-worm</i>

01:37:28.583 --> 01:37:29.917
<i>Glimmer glimmer</i>

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:31.958
<i>Shine little glow-worm</i>

01:37:32.042 --> 01:37:33.375
<i>Glimmer glimmer</i>

01:37:33.458 --> 01:37:36.458
<i>Lead us lest
Too far we wander</i>

01:37:36.542 --> 01:37:39.625
<i>Love's sweet voice
Is calling yonder</i>

01:37:39.708 --> 01:37:41.458
<i>Shine little glow-worm</i>

01:37:41.542 --> 01:37:43.000
<i>Glimmer glimmer</i>

01:37:43.083 --> 01:37:44.833
<i>Shine little glow-worm</i>

01:37:44.917 --> 01:37:46.500
<i>Glimmer glimmer</i>

01:37:46.583 --> 01:37:47.958
I'm sorry JJ.

01:37:48.042 --> 01:37:51.375
It's almost time to go to the drive-in
to screen the rest of the picture.

01:37:53.167 --> 01:37:56.292
<i>Shine little glow-worm
Glimmer glimmer</i>

01:38:03.083 --> 01:38:05.792
<i>Shine all over me</i>

01:38:16.125 --> 01:38:17.208
Sounds like shooting.

01:38:17.792 --> 01:38:19.375
Baron, I'm surprised at you.

01:38:20.167 --> 01:38:22.625
That's a lousy line of dialogue
and you know it.

01:38:27.542 --> 01:38:29.250
Fastest gun in the West, folks.

01:38:30.375 --> 01:38:31.208
Jake?

01:38:31.292 --> 01:38:34.208
- What the hell are we doing?
<i>- </i> We're having a party.

01:38:38.583 --> 01:38:40.750
Hey, you. Pocahontas.

01:38:49.333 --> 01:38:50.708
From your boss.

01:38:51.125 --> 01:38:52.917
He says you'll know what to do with it.

01:39:02.375 --> 01:39:04.375
By God, there's reinforcements.

01:39:04.458 --> 01:39:05.500
- Minnehaha.
- What?

01:39:05.583 --> 01:39:06.583
Princess Laughing Water.

01:39:06.917 --> 01:39:09.083
She's sure as hell
off the reservation tonight.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.708
But what I want to know is,
who the hell she's aiming at.

01:39:15.292 --> 01:39:17.125
If I know anything about Ole Massa Jake,

01:39:17.208 --> 01:39:20.417
that red-skinned lady is supposed to be
aiming at the dummies.

01:39:20.500 --> 01:39:21.500
But why?

01:39:22.167 --> 01:39:23.167
Why not?

01:39:50.125 --> 01:39:51.208
What's going on?

01:40:03.167 --> 01:40:05.125
Billy, have you seen this?

01:40:05.208 --> 01:40:06.375
Seen what?

01:40:07.083 --> 01:40:08.958
There are little men up there.

01:40:09.042 --> 01:40:11.250
They're shooting Roman candles
from the roof.

01:40:14.708 --> 01:40:16.167
Veteran troops, pilgrim.

01:40:17.167 --> 01:40:18.708
Neo-realists.

01:40:19.208 --> 01:40:21.083
And the grand old New Wave, sir.

01:40:21.458 --> 01:40:22.667
They'll never give up.

01:40:24.250 --> 01:40:25.667
What's all that about?

01:40:25.750 --> 01:40:27.833
I thought you knew about the midgets.

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.125
What's there to know about midgets?

01:40:30.208 --> 01:40:32.000
They broke into the wine cellar,

01:40:32.083 --> 01:40:34.833
now they got their tiny little hands
on the fireworks.

01:40:34.917 --> 01:40:36.500
They are going to spoil the party.

01:40:36.583 --> 01:40:38.000
Jake's done that already.

01:40:38.083 --> 01:40:40.083
Godard has just set up
a government in exile.

01:40:40.167 --> 01:40:41.167
Just a minute.

01:40:41.208 --> 01:40:44.625
- Will you let him tell his joke?
- I told you it wasn't much of a joke.

01:40:44.708 --> 01:40:45.917
What the hell is that?

01:40:50.708 --> 01:40:51.708
Artillery.

01:40:52.208 --> 01:40:53.125
The heavy stuff.

01:40:53.208 --> 01:40:55.708
Is the children and women folk safe?

01:40:55.792 --> 01:40:58.375
Safe? Someone's shooting at me.

01:40:58.458 --> 01:40:59.893
- They're in the stockade?
- Stockade?

01:40:59.917 --> 01:41:01.375
- What?
- Stockade?

01:41:01.458 --> 01:41:02.583
That's what I said.

01:41:03.292 --> 01:41:05.167
Alright now, attention everybody.

01:41:05.250 --> 01:41:08.208
Mr. Hannaford's motion picture
will continue projection

01:41:08.292 --> 01:41:11.750
in the Magnolia Gardens
Drive-In movie theater,

01:41:11.833 --> 01:41:14.333
which has been specially hired
for the occasion

01:41:14.417 --> 01:41:16.792
at the corner of El Dorado and Getty.

01:41:16.875 --> 01:41:19.333
Just one block south of the freeway.

01:41:19.417 --> 01:41:20.875
No tickets required.

01:41:21.083 --> 01:41:22.208
Another Hannaford shot?

01:41:22.292 --> 01:41:24.208
The drive-in is just
a short way from here

01:41:24.292 --> 01:41:26.000
on the route to Los Angeles.

01:41:26.083 --> 01:41:27.958
So all you that miss the closing reels,

01:41:28.042 --> 01:41:30.125
can now view this material

01:41:30.208 --> 01:41:32.375
from the comfort of your own cars.

01:41:32.625 --> 01:41:34.333
Thank you and goodnight.

01:41:34.625 --> 01:41:37.042
Well, if Bastolucci
doesn't surrender now...

01:41:37.125 --> 01:41:38.167
Bertolucci.

01:41:38.583 --> 01:41:40.083
Slice him how you want to,

01:41:40.458 --> 01:41:43.542
he's-a going to be one spicy meatball.

01:41:45.208 --> 01:41:47.208
You see that little old lady over there,

01:41:47.667 --> 01:41:50.042
the one with the blue tennis shoes?

01:41:50.125 --> 01:41:50.958
You see her?

01:41:51.042 --> 01:41:52.625
- Where?
- No, you mean "Who?"

01:41:53.292 --> 01:41:54.667
Alright, who?

01:41:55.542 --> 01:41:56.542
It's Governor Reegan.

01:41:56.583 --> 01:41:57.958
- Reagan.
- That's who, Reegan.

01:41:58.042 --> 01:41:59.250
- Reagan.
- Reegan.

01:41:59.333 --> 01:42:00.667
- Reagan.
- Reegan, Reagan.

01:42:04.125 --> 01:42:07.000
Approached by a video freak
with an indecent suggestion,

01:42:07.875 --> 01:42:09.958
just as he was sneaking
across the state line,

01:42:10.250 --> 01:42:12.375
Ronnie's wig slipped.

01:42:12.833 --> 01:42:14.875
Is he still governor, Governor?

01:42:15.208 --> 01:42:17.542
He has decreed a state of emergency,

01:42:17.625 --> 01:42:20.125
and thrown himself on the mercy
of Central Casting.

01:42:26.833 --> 01:42:29.708
Wayne himself,
now a barefoot friar,

01:42:29.792 --> 01:42:31.042
has been arrested

01:42:31.125 --> 01:42:32.583
for denigrating all over

01:42:32.667 --> 01:42:35.333
a Daughter of the American Revolution.

01:42:35.750 --> 01:42:38.542
Jessel is demanding equal time.
Here, catch.

01:42:39.417 --> 01:42:42.542
Five of our best biographers have
just gone over to Preminger.

01:42:43.417 --> 01:42:45.958
- Antononi-oni-o...
- What?

01:42:46.333 --> 01:42:47.708
They're dropping over Burbank.

01:42:47.792 --> 01:42:53.208
Will the owner of the '74 blue Impala
please come down and move it?

01:42:57.917 --> 01:43:00.583
I wonder if our leader has any idea
who that belongs to?

01:43:01.458 --> 01:43:02.833
No, but he paid for it.

01:43:02.958 --> 01:43:05.042
- What?
- It was supposed to be Dale's.

01:43:05.125 --> 01:43:07.625
- Wow.
- We weren't giving him much of a salary.

01:43:07.708 --> 01:43:10.428
So he would have gotten that as a bonus
when he finished the picture.

01:43:10.792 --> 01:43:12.125
He didn't, so he doesn't.

01:43:14.750 --> 01:43:16.875
Now, here's a late bulletin...

01:43:17.083 --> 01:43:18.250
Marlon Brando,

01:43:18.542 --> 01:43:19.750
who, by the way, folks,

01:43:19.833 --> 01:43:21.208
is not pregnant,

01:43:21.792 --> 01:43:25.875
has gone underground
and is doing splendid work for all of us,

01:43:26.167 --> 01:43:28.750
under the name, Tokyo Rose.

01:43:29.417 --> 01:43:31.875
Chin up, Brooksie.
They haven't got us yet.

01:43:35.125 --> 01:43:38.125
Here's a lady tells us
we've got to stick together, Jake and I.

01:43:38.208 --> 01:43:41.208
The farther you're apart,
the harder it will always be to hide.

01:43:41.292 --> 01:43:43.125
What would we be hiding, lady?

01:43:43.208 --> 01:43:44.917
How much you really hate each other.

01:43:46.792 --> 01:43:48.292
You've got it slightly wrong.

01:43:49.083 --> 01:43:50.083
Yes?

01:43:52.667 --> 01:43:55.375
MAGNOLIA GARDENS
DRIVE-IN

01:44:23.167 --> 01:44:24.583
Hot coffee? Over here.

01:44:27.125 --> 01:44:28.500
Can't see another case.

01:44:29.708 --> 01:44:30.708
Black coffee.

01:44:32.625 --> 01:44:34.583
I hope Jake's one of your customers.

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:36.000
That's the idea.

01:44:37.833 --> 01:44:38.833
Of course.

01:44:40.625 --> 01:44:44.208
I wouldn't give much for the rest of them.
But lucky he's got you, Baron.

01:44:44.875 --> 01:44:46.292
He'll get along without me.

01:44:48.875 --> 01:44:49.958
What does that mean?

01:44:50.083 --> 01:44:52.750
There's a time for all things
under the sun, Mr. Otterlake.

01:44:53.583 --> 01:44:55.667
I'm getting much too old for my job.

01:44:56.292 --> 01:44:57.625
If you can call it that.

01:44:58.208 --> 01:44:59.208
Nonsense.

01:44:59.375 --> 01:45:01.375
What I wouldn't give
for somebody like you.

01:45:01.875 --> 01:45:03.250
I'm not on the market.

01:45:04.167 --> 01:45:05.333
You never were.

01:45:05.708 --> 01:45:08.708
Even for a neutral observer,
there is a price.

01:45:09.708 --> 01:45:11.208
Not worth it for you, though.

01:45:11.750 --> 01:45:13.792
You're not quite tough enough for that.

01:45:14.292 --> 01:45:15.292
Not yet.

01:45:16.667 --> 01:45:19.292
But who knows, Mr. Otterlake,
perhaps you will be.

01:45:20.625 --> 01:45:23.375
And where will that put me, Baron,
in your estimation?

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:25.167
Where do you want to be?

01:45:26.917 --> 01:45:29.167
No, what you need, now and always,

01:45:29.500 --> 01:45:30.667
are the soldiers,

01:45:31.208 --> 01:45:32.708
the good soldiers.

01:45:34.125 --> 01:45:35.458
Men like Billy.

01:45:36.708 --> 01:45:38.917
They followed Hannibal and Napoleon.

01:45:40.125 --> 01:45:41.833
They really crossed the Alps.

01:45:43.250 --> 01:45:45.500
They are the heroes in any story.

01:45:48.333 --> 01:45:49.792
Is there a movie in it?

01:46:37.167 --> 01:46:38.167
Excuse me.

01:46:38.292 --> 01:46:40.292
I'm afraid we're getting out of sequence.

01:46:40.708 --> 01:46:42.625
Someone must have
given you the wrong reel.

01:46:42.708 --> 01:46:43.708
Does it matter?

01:46:48.417 --> 01:46:51.375
Maggie ought to be here,
keeping the reels in order.

01:46:51.875 --> 01:46:52.875
Who?

01:46:54.792 --> 01:46:57.250
- She's the film editor.
- I haven't seen her.

01:46:59.500 --> 01:47:00.500
Well...

01:47:06.625 --> 01:47:07.625
Well...

01:47:09.125 --> 01:47:10.417
You're right, I suppose.

01:47:11.583 --> 01:47:13.125
It doesn't matter at all.

01:47:17.750 --> 01:47:20.333
"But this rough magic he here abjures.

01:47:21.083 --> 01:47:22.875
Take back that last, it doesn't fit."

01:47:24.208 --> 01:47:26.000
What does "abjure" mean?

01:47:26.708 --> 01:47:29.042
- You went to Harvard.
- Give up.

01:47:31.292 --> 01:47:32.625
Is that a suggestion?

01:47:33.375 --> 01:47:35.333
"Abjure," he knows what it means.

01:47:36.125 --> 01:47:38.625
I gave up in the seventh grade.

01:47:39.417 --> 01:47:40.583
How about you?

01:47:44.125 --> 01:47:45.125
Never.

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:47.042
Not even then.

01:47:51.458 --> 01:47:53.625
And I didn't learn my Shakespeare
at Harvard.

01:47:54.625 --> 01:47:56.417
Mr. Otterfield here...

01:47:57.208 --> 01:47:58.542
wanted to be an actor,

01:47:58.625 --> 01:48:00.458
then he saw one of my films.

01:48:00.542 --> 01:48:02.417
We all read the interview.

01:48:03.792 --> 01:48:05.792
He is a rough magician, isn't he?

01:48:08.083 --> 01:48:09.625
You can kiss my sweet ass.

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:12.583
What did I do wrong, Daddy?

01:48:17.833 --> 01:48:18.875
"Our revels...

01:48:20.125 --> 01:48:21.208
now are ended."

01:48:23.625 --> 01:48:25.250
You bet your sweet cheeks.

01:48:32.333 --> 01:48:33.583
I thoughtyou had left.

01:48:34.042 --> 01:48:36.250
We had to hire this drive-in
for the whole night.

01:48:36.333 --> 01:48:38.625
Somebody had to make the arrangements,
didn't they?

01:48:38.792 --> 01:48:40.125
It's on the way back to town.

01:48:40.792 --> 01:48:42.875
Monday, I'll have an office at Universal.

01:48:43.417 --> 01:48:44.417
Give me a ring.

01:48:44.917 --> 01:48:46.542
- This station wagon.
- What about it?

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:48.125
It belongs to Jake.

01:48:48.833 --> 01:48:51.208
Where shall I pick it up? At Universal?

01:48:51.292 --> 01:48:52.917
It goes back to the dealer.

01:48:53.375 --> 01:48:54.375
Yes.

01:48:54.917 --> 01:48:56.417
Like the sports car, I suppose.

01:48:57.167 --> 01:49:00.042
- The one Jake is driving.
- That one's paid for.

01:49:00.125 --> 01:49:02.250
That was going to be a present, remember?

01:49:02.875 --> 01:49:03.917
For John Dale.

01:49:04.500 --> 01:49:06.083
When he finished the picture.

01:49:10.458 --> 01:49:13.000
Wait a minute.

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.958
- What's with Billy?
- He ran out of gumdrops.

01:49:44.292 --> 01:49:45.667
Going, so soon, honey?

01:49:46.542 --> 01:49:47.542
Yes.

01:49:47.708 --> 01:49:49.375
Wasn't much fun for you, was it?

01:49:50.125 --> 01:49:51.125
Goddamn midgets.

01:49:51.750 --> 01:49:52.750
Friends of yours?

01:49:53.250 --> 01:49:54.667
So sorry, Zarah.

01:49:55.417 --> 01:49:57.458
I'm afraid our leader's a little pissed.

01:49:57.625 --> 01:50:00.542
She doesn't like you, kid.
That's why she gave the party.

01:50:00.625 --> 01:50:03.375
She figures I don't relate enough
to the younger generation.

01:50:04.083 --> 01:50:05.375
Just through you.

01:50:05.625 --> 01:50:06.625
But I do, you know.

01:50:06.917 --> 01:50:08.708
I relate all I need to relate.

01:50:19.500 --> 01:50:20.500
Hey, beautiful.

01:50:20.583 --> 01:50:22.375
Couldn't we fix it to see each other

01:50:22.458 --> 01:50:24.875
just a little bit less seldom?

01:50:26.042 --> 01:50:27.250
With an old friend...

01:50:28.625 --> 01:50:30.417
it's quite enough to know he's there.

01:50:31.917 --> 01:50:34.125
Like Gibraltar, the Eiffel Tower...

01:50:35.917 --> 01:50:36.917
Durability.

01:50:38.542 --> 01:50:39.750
It can be rather fragile.

01:50:41.875 --> 01:50:44.292
Sometimes to keep that feeling,

01:50:45.083 --> 01:50:46.667
we need to keep our distance.

01:50:48.792 --> 01:50:51.583
The bad thing is to find out
that a friendship

01:50:51.667 --> 01:50:53.625
was between a couple of other people.

01:50:55.250 --> 01:50:56.375
Thanks, Mother.

01:50:59.458 --> 01:51:00.458
Do you hear that?

01:51:00.500 --> 01:51:02.500
That's Old Manolito. Remember?

01:51:13.625 --> 01:51:15.042
We found him together.

01:51:15.125 --> 01:51:16.167
In Spain.

01:51:17.500 --> 01:51:18.500
Where is he now?

01:51:19.292 --> 01:51:20.667
Back there with our hostess,

01:51:21.208 --> 01:51:22.208
by the limo.

01:51:22.375 --> 01:51:23.875
Valeska. Is she leaving?

01:51:24.208 --> 01:51:25.292
Looks that way.

01:51:26.917 --> 01:51:29.333
She'll have to answer
a few questions first.

01:51:34.708 --> 01:51:36.542
Say goodnight for me to your actress.

01:51:37.208 --> 01:51:39.125
She was pretty good in there
with that gun.

01:51:39.250 --> 01:51:40.917
She wasn't shooting at the dummies.

01:51:42.792 --> 01:51:45.500
The preferred target, I suppose,
would have been me.

01:51:46.750 --> 01:51:49.500
Preferred by whom, Mr. Hannaford?
You gave her the gun.

01:51:49.833 --> 01:51:50.875
What does that mean?

01:51:51.625 --> 01:51:53.167
What's it supposed to mean?

01:51:53.583 --> 01:51:54.583
Don't worry.

01:51:55.292 --> 01:51:57.333
Even if she doesn't know, she'll tell us.

01:51:58.125 --> 01:51:59.375
Miss Valeska,

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.333
you made just one film
with Mr. Hannaford.

01:52:02.625 --> 01:52:03.625
Yes.

01:52:03.833 --> 01:52:05.917
Glen Garvey was your leading man.

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.958
It is true, isn't it,
that during the shooting of that film,

01:52:09.042 --> 01:52:11.125
Mr. Hannaford had an affair
with Garvey's wife?

01:52:12.375 --> 01:52:14.292
Men are the subject of his films.

01:52:14.583 --> 01:52:16.167
And whoever the man is,

01:52:16.458 --> 01:52:18.292
naturally, he's got a girl, right?

01:52:18.500 --> 01:52:19.958
And whoever she is,

01:52:20.208 --> 01:52:23.083
somehow, finally, Hannaford seduces her.

01:52:24.250 --> 01:52:26.042
He must. He has to possess her,

01:52:26.125 --> 01:52:28.417
because it's the only way
that he can possess him.

01:52:28.500 --> 01:52:30.000
We'll have to stop this, you know.

01:52:30.708 --> 01:52:32.708
Okay, cut it, you guys.

01:52:32.792 --> 01:52:34.500
Expensive vice, isn't it?

01:52:34.917 --> 01:52:36.500
After he's had his actor's girl,

01:52:36.583 --> 01:52:37.583
he throws her away.

01:52:37.625 --> 01:52:40.958
And then he's thrown his actor away,
and destroyed him in the process.

01:52:41.250 --> 01:52:42.875
Maybe that's what you really want.

01:52:48.458 --> 01:52:50.667
You son of a bitch,
you belong in a B-movie.

01:52:50.750 --> 01:52:53.167
Pick on someone your own size,
motherfucker.

01:52:53.958 --> 01:52:55.917
I'm alright. Would you let go of me?

01:52:56.542 --> 01:52:58.458
Alright! Go home!

01:52:58.542 --> 01:53:00.583
They're still gettingÂ all this
on film, you know.

01:53:00.667 --> 01:53:02.417
Who gives a shit?

01:53:03.792 --> 01:53:06.292
Where's your public, for Christ's sake.

01:53:06.583 --> 01:53:10.000
Before any of you creeps
could put this stuff together,

01:53:10.083 --> 01:53:11.583
we'll have our own movie.

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:13.625
A real movie.

01:53:20.625 --> 01:53:22.917
- What happened to the critic lady?
- She'll live.

01:53:23.958 --> 01:53:25.583
She'll live to write about it.

01:53:29.625 --> 01:53:32.375
- Don't let him get you down, Brooksie.
- Do you?

01:53:33.208 --> 01:53:34.208
Not yet.

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.083
<i>Remember those Berbers
up in the Atlas?</i>

01:53:58.167 --> 01:54:00.083
<i>They wouldn't let us point
a camera at them.</i>

01:54:00.625 --> 01:54:02.958
<i>They're certain that it
dries up something.</i>

01:54:04.500 --> 01:54:06.083
<i>The old eye, you know...</i>

01:54:06.500 --> 01:54:08.250
<i>behind the magic box.</i>

01:54:09.292 --> 01:54:11.292
<i>Could be it's an evil eye, at that.</i>

01:54:11.625 --> 01:54:12.625
<i>Medusa's.</i>

01:54:30.208 --> 01:54:31.208
Johnny?

01:54:32.917 --> 01:54:33.917
So...

01:54:34.333 --> 01:54:35.958
you came to my party after all.

01:54:39.542 --> 01:54:41.250
Get in, I'll drive you.

01:54:46.958 --> 01:54:47.958
Chicken?

01:57:29.625 --> 01:57:30.625
<i>Who knows,</i>

01:57:31.125 --> 01:57:33.542
<i>maybe you can stare too hard at something.</i>

01:57:34.583 --> 01:57:38.333
<i>Drain out the virtue,
suck out the living juice.</i>

01:57:40.375 --> 01:57:43.375
<i>You shoot the great places
and the pretty people.</i>

01:57:44.875 --> 01:57:47.500
<i>All those girls and boys.</i>

01:57:49.167 --> 01:57:50.375
<i>Shoot them dead.</i>

02:02:17.458 --> 02:02:18.458
<i>Cut.</i>

02:02:18.708 --> 02:02:21.667
