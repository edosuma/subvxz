<i>You are being watched.</i>

<i>The government has a secret system.</i>
<b><font color="#0A7C32">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

00:08.242 --> 00:12.657
<i>A machine that spies on you

00:12.813 --> 00:16.761
<i>I designed The Machine to detect acts

00:16.917 --> 00:20.228
<i>violent crimes
involving ordinary people.</i>

00:20.387 --> 00:24.426
The government considers
these people irrelevant. We don't.

00:25.425 --> 00:29.100
<i>Hunted by the authorities,
we work in secret.</i>

00:30.097 --> 00:31.667
<i>You'll never find us</i>

00:31.832 --> 00:36.781

00:46.513 --> 00:48.789
- I've got this.
- No, you don't.

00:50.017 --> 00:51.553
You're gonna blow our cover.

00:51.718 --> 00:55.029
- I'm rowing this boat.
- Not on my watch.

00:55.188 --> 00:57.794
Given your cover, it might be more
appropriate for Mr. Reese

00:57.958 --> 00:59.869
to have the privilege, Ms. Shaw.

01:01.461 --> 01:04.236
You are supposed
to be on a date, after all.

01:11.371 --> 01:13.373
You're welcome.

01:13.540 --> 01:17.454
- So who's our Romeo?
- His name <i>is</i> Ian Murphy.

01:17.611 --> 01:19.887
<i>He's a successful investor
in a variety of businesses,</i>

01:20.047 --> 01:23.324
a coffee house, a nightclub,
a microbrewery.

01:23.483 --> 01:24.928
How's his portfolio?

01:25.085 --> 01:27.122
Maybe he owes money
to the wrong people.

01:27.287 --> 01:28.967
No, all his businesses
are doing quite well

01:29.089 --> 01:30.966
and he has a stellar credit report.

01:31.124 --> 01:33.434
He grew up quite destitute.

01:33.594 --> 01:35.665
His parents both died
when he was just a teenager

01:35.829 --> 01:38.639
and then a kindly uncle
left him nearly 100,000 dollars.

01:38.799 --> 01:41.177
<i>I suggest that one of you
gets to Murphy's apartment</i>

01:41.335 --> 01:43.076
<i>in SoHo before he returns.</i>

01:43.236 --> 01:45.276
<i>What do you say we pick it up
over the weekend?</i>

01:45.300 --> 01:48.844
<i>I'll make you dinner.
I happen to be a great chef.</i>

01:49.009 --> 01:52.855
<i>A guy who knows his opera
and can cook. I'm impressed.</i>

01:53.013 --> 01:56.290
<i>- Is that a yes?
- It's an absolutely.</i>

01:56.450 --> 01:59.124
<i>We gotta head back.
I gotta be uptown in 20.</i>

01:59.286 --> 02:02.460
I'll go to his apartment, Finch.
See what I can find.

02:02.623 --> 02:04.796
Okay, but it's my turn
to row this thing.

02:19.706 --> 02:24.177
Finch?
I think I got something.

02:24.344 --> 02:27.154
Well, I hope it's regarding his phone
because I've lost our connection.

02:27.314 --> 02:29.385
I may know why. Our guy just went
from blue blood to hipster

02:29.549 --> 02:31.358
faster than you can say
ironic facial hair.

02:31.518 --> 02:33.158
I don't understand
anything you just said.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.800
He ditched his date, changed
his clothes, his whole appearance.

02:35.824 --> 02:38.344
So this guy's up to something
and I'm betting it's nothing good.

02:43.997 --> 02:45.637
<i>Just arrived
at Murphy's apartment.</i>

03:01.148 --> 03:05.597
<i>- Shaw, you got an update on Murphy?
- It appears our boy's a ladies' man.</i>

03:05.752 --> 03:08.255
I followed him
to some dive in the village.

03:08.422 --> 03:10.902
New image, new girl.

03:11.591 --> 03:13.036
We could go back to my place.

03:13.193 --> 03:14.263
Guy's a chameleon.

03:14.428 --> 03:18.205
<i>Organized, efficient, sociopathic.</i>

03:18.365 --> 03:20.106
Not that there's anything wrong
with that.

03:20.267 --> 03:23.510
It seems Mr. Murphy
finds his dates online.

03:23.670 --> 03:25.750
<i>He meets most of the women
on smartphone applications</i>

03:25.839 --> 03:27.409
<i>like Tinder and Angler.</i>

03:27.574 --> 03:31.545
Members put up a profile
and then sign in at a given location.

03:33.413 --> 03:36.189
So much for keeping the mystery alive
in a relationship.

03:47.260 --> 03:48.762
Finch, he's keeping records.

03:48.929 --> 03:51.967
<i>Detailed flies,
tracking dozens of women.</i>

03:52.132 --> 03:56.945
- Where's he getting the information?
- From your typical stalker sites.

03:57.104 --> 04:00.813
Anything that promises
a decent background check.

04:00.974 --> 04:03.420
It's like he's hunting them.

04:03.577 --> 04:04.715
Why don't we just take him out now?

04:04.878 --> 04:07.438
Just because he's a stalker
doesn't mean he's a killer, Ms. Shaw.

04:07.481 --> 04:08.960
I wouldn't be so sure, Finch.

04:13.053 --> 04:17.228
He's got a missing persons flyer
for a woman named Jenna Lakritz.

04:22.162 --> 04:26.008
And there's an article he printed out

04:26.166 --> 04:27.839
about a woman
who died last week.

04:28.935 --> 04:30.778
Says it was a car accident.

04:30.937 --> 04:33.144
Car accident's a good way
to cover up a homicide.

04:33.306 --> 04:35.650
Exactly what I was thinking.

04:35.809 --> 04:39.347
This guy may have graduated
from stalker to killer after all.

04:53.693 --> 04:55.695
<i>No, ma'am.
We're still searching hospitals.</i>

04:55.862 --> 04:57.842
But we're closing in on her.

04:58.965 --> 05:00.725
She worked on his desk
for nearly six months.

05:00.801 --> 05:02.872
Knew about the program.

05:03.703 --> 05:05.205
I have a feeling
Ms. May knows exactly

05:05.372 --> 05:07.113
where Northern Lights is located.

05:08.375 --> 05:10.548
Well, if not, at least
we'll know for sure.

05:11.545 --> 05:13.047
Then I'll take care of her.

05:13.213 --> 05:16.160
Maybe a few decades in a black site.
Or something less cushy.

05:17.384 --> 05:19.796
Yes, ma'am. I'll call you as soon
as I have a location.

05:27.828 --> 05:30.138
<i>You seem calmer today, Robin.</i>

05:30.297 --> 05:33.642
I am.
It's almost time for me to leave.

05:34.801 --> 05:36.075
Where is it that you're going?

05:36.236 --> 05:40.514
You know, that's a good question.
I'm not certain yet.

05:40.674 --> 05:43.917
Because the voice
is going to tell you?

05:45.178 --> 05:46.680
You're catching on.

05:46.847 --> 05:48.554
Is the voice speaking
to you right now?

05:50.750 --> 05:54.926
Does it look like I'm talking
to anyone other than you, doctor?

05:55.889 --> 06:00.269
You realize that phone isn't
connected to a wireless carrier.

06:01.194 --> 06:04.368
- God doesn't need AT&T.
- Mm-hmm.

06:04.531 --> 06:08.377
Haven't I already proven to you
just how powerful she is?

06:10.370 --> 06:13.783
Well, you've certainly proven
the power of your mind.

06:13.940 --> 06:15.920
You've demonstrated
great intelligence

06:16.076 --> 06:18.215
and no doubt computer skills.

06:18.378 --> 06:21.916
Which is how you learned all those
nasty things about me.

06:28.288 --> 06:31.462
- You know, Robin, we're all fallible.
- Well, not all of us.

06:31.625 --> 06:33.969
I suppose it's you who needs therapy.

06:34.127 --> 06:35.936
It sounds like
you have a lot to work on.

06:36.930 --> 06:38.967
I can help you, Robin.

06:39.132 --> 06:41.976
You suffer from delusions
of grandeur,

06:42.135 --> 06:44.445
something caused
by your underlying condition.

06:44.604 --> 06:47.585
It's not a condition.
It's the future.

06:48.441 --> 06:50.648
By the time you figure out
what's really happening,

06:50.810 --> 06:53.256
I'll have transcended this reality.

06:53.413 --> 06:56.417
Why does your transcendence

06:56.583 --> 06:59.120
require your imprisonment
in this facility?

07:01.087 --> 07:04.660
- She has a plan.
- Which is what?

07:06.293 --> 07:07.636
I don't know yet.

07:09.229 --> 07:11.072
But I can't wait to find out.

07:15.902 --> 07:17.848
<i>Anything on the women
Murphy's stalking?</i>

07:18.004 --> 07:21.645
The missing woman, Jenna Lakritz,
is a former girlfriend of his.

07:21.808 --> 07:25.312
I'm able to look at her cell history,
but Mr. Murphy uses Vanish-text,

07:25.478 --> 07:28.322
an application designed
to delete his messages

07:28.481 --> 07:29.687
as soon as they've been read.

07:29.849 --> 07:32.352
Good for cheaters and killers.

07:32.519 --> 07:36.092
What about the girl
that was killed last week?

07:36.256 --> 07:39.931
Dana Wellington.
Daughter of Bruce Wellington.

07:41.094 --> 07:45.873
Auction house owner,
philanthropist, real estate magnate.

07:46.032 --> 07:49.206
Can't seem to find anything
connecting her to our Mr. Murphy

07:49.369 --> 07:52.373
except for the fact
that they attended the same college.

07:54.774 --> 07:56.617
Mr. Reese,
you didn't happen to purchase

07:56.776 --> 07:59.017
a new collar for Bear, did you?

07:59.179 --> 08:01.489
Or this gigantic cow femur
that he's eating?

08:01.648 --> 08:04.527
I've been a little busy, Finch.

08:04.684 --> 08:07.494
Seems Bear has a stalker of his own.

08:08.788 --> 08:13.066
As for Mr. Murphy,
he frequents a club called "Blur."

08:13.226 --> 08:15.172
I ran the names from the files
you discovered

08:15.328 --> 08:17.740
against women
who use the Angler application.

08:17.897 --> 08:20.070
All of them have checked
into that club at least once.

08:20.233 --> 08:21.507
I'll head there tonight.

08:21.668 --> 08:25.377
I'll just access the club's database
and create a reservation for you.

08:25.538 --> 08:27.916
Hold off on that.
I may have another idea.

08:28.074 --> 08:30.418
We don't have enough proof
to call the cops.

08:30.577 --> 08:32.852
That doesn't mean we can't set up
a trap of our own.

08:33.013 --> 08:34.014
What are you suggesting?

08:34.179 --> 08:36.820
Until we can figure out
if he's a killer or not,

08:36.982 --> 08:38.519
I say we stack the deck.

08:49.729 --> 08:51.072
- Yeah?
- Hello, Detective.

08:51.498 --> 08:53.618
I was hoping you could come
by the safe house tonight.

08:53.666 --> 08:55.626
I think I can assure you
it'll be more interesting

08:55.787 --> 08:57.425
than arresting
aging corporate attorneys

08:57.589 --> 08:59.281
<i>for driving under the influence.</i>

08:59.439 --> 09:00.747
You wanna give me the headlines?

09:00.907 --> 09:03.786
Only that it will require
evening attire.

09:04.878 --> 09:06.516
What I mean to say is,
something elegant

09:06.679 --> 09:10.855
but also less than conservative.

09:12.118 --> 09:13.859
Just what kind
of job is this, Finch?

09:18.291 --> 09:19.895
Not bad.

09:20.927 --> 09:23.407
Considering the last time I saw you,
you were in a body bag.

09:23.563 --> 09:25.440
I've been in worse places.

09:25.598 --> 09:28.408
I think this just might work.

09:29.969 --> 09:34.111
- So, this is where the party is.
- Ms. Morgan.

09:34.274 --> 09:36.982
This is Ms. Shaw
and you know Detective Carter.

09:37.143 --> 09:40.056
- Heard you came back from the dead.
- Only eight more lives left.

09:40.213 --> 09:42.659
- Zanotti's?
- Good eye.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.457
So we're your bait.

09:45.618 --> 09:48.792
Rather a crude way of putting it,
but I suppose it's apt.

09:48.955 --> 09:51.834
Our target is a chameleon
and probable killer.

09:51.991 --> 09:54.267
Just once, I wish you fellas
would call with something

09:54.427 --> 09:56.304
that didn't require a firearm.

09:56.463 --> 09:58.272
Why? Are you not carrying?

09:58.431 --> 10:00.843
I know better than
to show up unprepared.

10:05.071 --> 10:07.347
- You have the Nano?
- Yeah.

10:07.507 --> 10:08.952
I've been dying for one of these.

10:09.109 --> 10:12.283
- You can borrow it any time.
- Mm. It's pretty.

10:15.181 --> 10:16.455
Little gift from John.

10:16.616 --> 10:20.689
And, now that everyone
is sufficiently well-armed,

10:20.854 --> 10:24.427
I've taken the liberty of creating
profiles for all of you on Angler.

10:24.591 --> 10:26.093
So please, download this application
onto your phones

10:26.259 --> 10:28.339
so that you can check in
once you arrive at the club.

10:28.363 --> 10:30.070
I'd like to see that profile.

10:36.603 --> 10:40.813
- Really? A yoga instructor?
- You'd prefer trained killer?

10:40.974 --> 10:46.652
Mr. Murphy favors this application
when looking for new targets.

10:46.813 --> 10:51.228
And as far as getting his attention,
I doubt that that will be an issue.

10:51.384 --> 10:54.365
You'll have to use your charm, Shaw,
not your sidearm.

10:54.521 --> 10:56.296
I hope that's not a problem.

10:57.524 --> 10:59.731
What is that supposed to mean?

10:59.893 --> 11:02.464
I don't look good?
Because I think I look good.

11:02.629 --> 11:06.873
You look fine, Shaw.
You just look... angry.

11:07.033 --> 11:08.535
All the time.

11:10.403 --> 11:12.679
We'll work on it in the car.

11:26.019 --> 11:27.459
- Right here, lady.
- Thank you.

11:27.487 --> 11:28.659
Have a good time.

11:31.858 --> 11:32.859
So where's our target?

11:33.026 --> 11:35.028
Manager says he shows
around midnight.

11:35.195 --> 11:36.868
Then what are we
doing here so early?

11:37.030 --> 11:39.442
I was not gonna let those boys
send us off as killer bait

11:39.599 --> 11:43.513
- without getting something in return.
- I like your style.

11:43.670 --> 11:45.946
Sorry, girls, my system
only runs on diesel.

11:46.105 --> 11:48.210
So, what should we drink to?

11:48.374 --> 11:51.218
Here's hoping
nobody gets serial-killed.

11:58.117 --> 11:59.858
Okay, ladies,
time for us to check in.

12:05.458 --> 12:08.439
How you doing up there, Fusco?

12:08.595 --> 12:11.303
Yeah, all clear.
Although this place is a rip-off.

12:11.464 --> 12:13.444
Club soda cost me five dollars.

12:15.134 --> 12:16.807
Nice view, though.

12:22.742 --> 12:25.655
Joss. Relax.

12:25.812 --> 12:28.383
Lionel's upstairs, John's outside.

12:28.615 --> 12:31.494
Shaw's ready to shoot anybody
who looks at her sideways.

12:31.651 --> 12:34.996
- Let's go have fun.
- I second that.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.158
Woo!

12:36.222 --> 12:37.826
Okay.

13:00.513 --> 13:03.016
- Hey.
- Hey. How you doing?

13:03.182 --> 13:05.526
Heads up, ladies.
Our boy just landed.

13:40.386 --> 13:42.525
Do you mind if I join you?

13:46.859 --> 13:48.361
Sure.

13:55.401 --> 13:57.745
So I got a lot of respect
for what you do, Joss.

13:57.904 --> 13:59.884
It's a scary world out there.

14:01.140 --> 14:02.517
Very true.

14:03.242 --> 14:06.155
Never know what kind
of creeps you'll run into.

14:08.481 --> 14:11.428
I can't believe that they allow cops
to be so sexy though.

14:11.584 --> 14:13.495
There should be a law against that.

14:13.653 --> 14:16.896
All right. I should know better
than to give you a line.

14:18.324 --> 14:20.736
I do like the way you smile though.

14:20.893 --> 14:23.931
- Another line.
- No, not even a little bit.

14:27.767 --> 14:29.906
Let me make you dinner
tomorrow night.

14:30.069 --> 14:32.208
<i>I'll work on my witty banter.</i>

14:32.372 --> 14:34.682
I happen to be a great cook.
It's one of my many talents.

14:36.109 --> 14:39.386
<i>This is our chance,
Detective Carter. Please say yes.</i>

14:39.946 --> 14:41.084
- Yes.
- Yes!

14:54.293 --> 14:56.466
Heads up, partner.
Our guy's watching you.

15:04.804 --> 15:06.477
<i>Now he's tailing you.</i>

15:21.454 --> 15:23.400
He's still on your tail
so don't go home, okay?

15:23.556 --> 15:25.729
Where am I supposed to go, Fusco?

15:38.070 --> 15:42.177
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm good. Where'd he go?

15:42.575 --> 15:44.577
I saw the guy disappear
up the street.

15:45.411 --> 15:48.324
Safe to say if he was looking
for his next victim, he found her.

16:00.593 --> 16:01.799
Where's Mr. Reese?

16:01.961 --> 16:03.770
Staying out with Caner
until her date tonight.

16:06.599 --> 16:07.839
Good boy.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.879
I have had some luck tracing
the money he received nine years ago.

16:11.037 --> 16:13.950
I thought it came from his uncle.

16:14.106 --> 16:17.553
Actually, it came from a shell
corporation out of Switzerland,

16:17.710 --> 16:19.712
funded by Bruce Wellington.

16:19.879 --> 16:22.325
So there's a connection
to the dead girl after all.

16:22.482 --> 16:26.897
Look. This is a GPS map
of one of Murphy's SIM cards.

16:27.053 --> 16:28.794
He was in the Hamptons last week.

16:28.955 --> 16:31.697
Same day
as Dana Wellington's funeral.

16:31.858 --> 16:33.633
Sicko was probably
reliving his crime.

16:34.527 --> 16:36.302
Maybe Carter can get
more info on her date.

16:42.401 --> 16:45.575
- So, what are we having?
- Don't worry. Nothing with tree nuts.

16:46.839 --> 16:49.251
- How did you know I was allergic?
- I pay attention.

16:49.408 --> 16:52.412
See, if more guys did that, they'd
find the opposite sex less confusing.

16:52.578 --> 16:54.489
That's not an answer.

16:54.647 --> 16:57.594
You pushed away a little bowl
of almonds at the club.

16:57.750 --> 16:59.559
Your face said
it was out of protection,

16:59.752 --> 17:02.699
so, severe nut allergy.
Hm?

17:06.659 --> 17:08.695
- You'd make a good detective.
- Huh.

17:10.229 --> 17:12.071
You know, that's funny.

17:12.231 --> 17:14.074
I was thinking the same thing
about you.

17:16.435 --> 17:17.607
What do you mean?

17:17.770 --> 17:20.114
The way you were watching
everyone in the club.

17:20.272 --> 17:22.685
I know your Angler profile
says you're an officer

17:22.842 --> 17:26.847
but you seem
more like a detective to me.

17:29.549 --> 17:31.256
Well...

17:33.252 --> 17:36.722
...I was a detective.
Homicide.

17:36.889 --> 17:38.926
But I'm doing
something different now.

17:39.091 --> 17:41.628
It's not where I thought
I would wind up...

17:43.563 --> 17:45.634
...but it's where
I need to be right now.

17:49.869 --> 17:51.109
Well.

17:59.979 --> 18:01.899
- What's he doing? Should I shoot him?
- Not yet.

18:02.048 --> 18:03.493
What?

18:04.584 --> 18:07.326
Sorry. Just shiitake mushrooms.

18:09.722 --> 18:12.168
I wasn't making a move.

18:12.892 --> 18:14.769
Yet.

18:16.162 --> 18:19.473
- She doesn't have her guard up.
- You're joking.

18:19.632 --> 18:22.943
That woman's got a guard of steel.
You two have a thing or something?

18:23.102 --> 18:25.514
Because, I mean, I clocked you
and Zoe right off the bat

18:25.671 --> 18:30.177
- but I never thought you and Carter...
- We're just friends.

18:30.343 --> 18:33.688
Well, your "just friend"
is doing her job.

18:33.846 --> 18:38.522
She gets this guy to trust her
maybe he makes a move.

18:38.684 --> 18:40.186
And we can finally shoot him.

18:42.488 --> 18:44.195
So, what do you do for a living, Ian?

18:45.591 --> 18:48.333
I own pieces of a bunch
of small companies.

18:48.494 --> 18:52.101
How did you get started?
Help from friends or family?

18:53.165 --> 18:54.872
Kind of.

18:55.034 --> 18:58.038
I've been an emancipated minor
since I was 17.

18:58.204 --> 19:00.707
Then one day I'm in college,

19:00.873 --> 19:04.616
some lawyer shows up
with a check for 100 grand.

19:04.777 --> 19:08.384
From some uncle I had never met,
and all of a sudden I...

19:08.547 --> 19:10.891
Well, I had these options.

19:11.050 --> 19:15.465
Never really had those before,
so I started my own business.

19:16.889 --> 19:22.237
If I was gonna be alone,
I was gonna do it on my own terms.

19:25.064 --> 19:29.877
So, how long have you
and Zoe been special friends?

19:30.036 --> 19:32.073
Well, I haven't really
counted the days, Shaw.

19:32.238 --> 19:35.481
What about you?
Any big dates lately?

19:35.641 --> 19:38.087
Been too busy saving the world
from bad guys.

19:38.244 --> 19:41.248
Besides, relationships
are for amateurs.

19:41.414 --> 19:45.055
Guys these days
have so many emotions.

19:45.217 --> 19:47.595
They cry, they wanna be held.

19:47.753 --> 19:49.273
I just don't know
what to do with them.

19:49.297 --> 19:52.301
So... you're a nun?

19:53.259 --> 19:55.427
I'm a pragmatist, John.

19:55.428 --> 20:00.502
I go out, have a fun night, or three.

20:00.666 --> 20:04.079
And then... I move on, you know?
No muss, no fuss.

20:05.671 --> 20:06.671
Hm...

20:17.717 --> 20:19.924
Password, please.

20:24.423 --> 20:26.630
My hands are a little shaky.

20:26.792 --> 20:28.635
Side effect from the Thorazine,
I suppose.

20:28.794 --> 20:31.297
Would you mind typing it in for me?

20:34.200 --> 20:35.270
Thank you.

20:35.434 --> 20:39.883
Prescription
from Dr. Ronald Carmichael.

20:40.039 --> 20:42.315
Desflurane. Two vials, please.

20:43.542 --> 20:46.751
No, make it three.

21:08.667 --> 21:10.010
You didn't have to walk me out.

21:10.169 --> 21:12.450
Well, I didn't want you waiting
for a cab all by yourself.

21:12.605 --> 21:16.348
- I know, you're a cop, but...
- But you're a gentleman.

21:16.408 --> 21:17.512
I try.

21:20.846 --> 21:22.726
I had a really nice time
with you tonight, Joss.

21:22.815 --> 21:25.091
Yeah, I did too.

21:25.251 --> 21:27.458
And you know what?
You were right.

21:27.620 --> 21:30.328
That was the best
Chilean sea bass I've ever had.

21:30.489 --> 21:32.196
Good.

21:42.601 --> 21:44.547
Two bogies coming your way, Carter.

21:48.674 --> 21:50.676
All right. All right, guys.

21:50.843 --> 21:53.483
No need for violence, guys.
Just, you know, take what you want.

21:54.780 --> 21:58.728
Unfortunately for you, Ian,
we're not here for your wallet.

21:58.884 --> 22:00.557
Ready?
- Ready, ready.

22:06.992 --> 22:11.031
- Nice aim, Shaw.
- Back at you.

22:12.631 --> 22:13.735
Ian, are you okay?

22:15.201 --> 22:17.921
Be a hell of a lot better if you
told me who you actually were, Joss.

22:49.101 --> 22:50.876
Hey. I got some interesting
information

22:51.036 --> 22:52.447
from muggers dumb and dumber.

22:52.605 --> 22:55.245
- I imagine they were hired hands?
- Bingo.

22:55.407 --> 22:57.751
Said a guy by the name of Kip Davis
hired them.

22:57.910 --> 23:00.288
I made a few calls,
found out this guy, Davis,

23:00.446 --> 23:02.119
head of security
for Bruce Wellington.

23:02.281 --> 23:04.081
<i>And that's certainly
not a coincidence.</i>

23:04.105 --> 23:06.085
Thank you, Detective.

23:08.787 --> 23:11.097
I get that, but how did you know

23:11.257 --> 23:12.793
that someone was
gonna come after me?

23:12.958 --> 23:15.802
We had inside information
that someone wanted you dead.

23:15.961 --> 23:19.807
Or maybe
it was the other way around.

23:19.965 --> 23:24.937
Wait. You...
You think I'd hurt someone?

23:25.104 --> 23:27.983
We've seen your stalker stash, Ian.

23:30.910 --> 23:33.982
It's not stalking.
It's research.

23:35.781 --> 23:38.261
Women like that I can
anticipate their needs.

23:39.318 --> 23:41.059
They're used to guys
doing the bare minimum.

23:41.220 --> 23:45.225
I go above and beyond.
Try it sometime.

23:49.295 --> 23:51.673
You're hunting them.

23:52.932 --> 23:56.744
I want their info,
they're giving it to me straight up.

23:56.902 --> 23:59.974
And, yeah, I get a little overly
efficient in my due diligence, but...

24:02.174 --> 24:03.847
...they like it.

24:04.009 --> 24:07.582
If they liked it so much, how come
those relationships don't last?

24:07.746 --> 24:11.489
They're not supposed to.
It's kind of the point.

24:11.650 --> 24:15.962
Mr. Murphy, why would
Bruce Wellington want you dead?

24:16.121 --> 24:18.465
Were you involved with his daughter?

24:20.693 --> 24:23.674
Ian, tell us what's going on
so we can help you.

24:30.135 --> 24:33.446
Dana and I, we met
when she was still in college

24:33.605 --> 24:36.051
and I was tending bar, trying
to keep up with my student loans

24:36.208 --> 24:38.381
and we fell in love.

24:40.479 --> 24:41.981
No research needed.

24:43.682 --> 24:45.218
Mr. Fortune 500 did not appreciate

24:45.384 --> 24:49.161
his daughter dating poor,
white Southie trash, but...

24:50.556 --> 24:52.229
...then Dana got pregnant.

24:53.726 --> 24:55.137
Now, you gotta understand this.

24:55.294 --> 24:59.572
Wellington, he rules that family
with an iron fist.

24:59.732 --> 25:04.238
So one day one of Wellington's
lackeys shows up at my door

25:04.403 --> 25:08.146
and he tells me that,
Dana got an abortion...

25:09.908 --> 25:12.582
...and he gives me a check.

25:13.679 --> 25:17.889
He says that I have to get out
of town or Wellington'll ruin me.

25:18.817 --> 25:20.421
So you took the money?

25:22.054 --> 25:26.264
Dana was all I had in the world.

25:27.192 --> 25:32.073
And I must have called her 100 times
and she never called me back.

25:32.231 --> 25:34.609
She was terrified of her father.
They all were.

25:35.834 --> 25:39.281
And that was... nine years ago.

25:39.438 --> 25:42.612
And I haven't had anything to do
with her or her family since.

25:43.842 --> 25:45.583
Until you went to her funeral.

25:47.513 --> 25:49.186
How could I not go?

25:50.516 --> 25:55.590
Wellington saw me and he flipped out
and started screaming,

25:55.754 --> 25:57.631
right there at Dana's grave.

25:57.790 --> 26:00.771
Why would he be so upset with you
after all this time?

26:00.926 --> 26:03.270
I don't know, Joss.

26:03.429 --> 26:08.105
I swear.
I didn't stay to find out.

26:15.707 --> 26:18.984
- I like Bear's new collar.
- Seemed more his style.

26:19.144 --> 26:20.987
That dinosaur bone
from you as well?

26:21.146 --> 26:24.389
- Yeah, he loves that thing.
- His intestines beg to differ.

26:27.820 --> 26:30.164
Shaw, take a look at this.

26:37.329 --> 26:39.468
Are you both seeing
what I'm seeing?

26:40.732 --> 26:42.939
That kid's what? Eight? Nine?

26:43.102 --> 26:46.015
I suppose we now know
why Mr. Wellington wants Ian dead.

26:46.171 --> 26:48.412
Dana didn't have
an abortion after all.

26:48.574 --> 26:51.680
Daddy probably figured Ian showed up
at the funeral to take away his heir.

26:51.844 --> 26:55.257
I think it's time we meet
Mr. Wellington in person.

26:55.414 --> 26:57.451
What should
Detective Caner tell Ian?

26:58.183 --> 26:59.662
The truth.

27:06.325 --> 27:07.702
I don't understand.

27:07.860 --> 27:11.774
Dana's sister, Marissa,
raised him as her own.

27:11.930 --> 27:13.034
She was ten years older.

27:13.198 --> 27:17.374
I imagine she seemed like
a more suitable parent at the time.

27:19.605 --> 27:23.849
How could they do this to me?
Why would Dana lie?

27:24.009 --> 27:27.218
Like you said, Mr. Wellington
is a very powerful man,

27:27.379 --> 27:30.724
willing to do anything
to keep up appearances.

27:30.883 --> 27:33.056
Dana knew that a lie
was the only thing

27:33.218 --> 27:34.697
that would get you to leave Boston.

27:37.055 --> 27:38.535
So he gets
to take everything from me.

27:38.557 --> 27:41.868
My home and my... my child?

27:42.027 --> 27:45.133
No, Ian. He doesn't.

27:45.297 --> 27:46.901
Because we're going
to set things right.

27:47.065 --> 27:48.408
How?

27:49.334 --> 27:51.211
Finch is going to break
into the kid's locker,

27:51.370 --> 27:55.750
take Alex's school-issued water
bottle and use it for the DNA tests.

27:55.908 --> 27:58.047
Sounds like a safe enough plan.
I'm going with him.

27:58.210 --> 27:59.211
It's not safe, Ian.

27:59.378 --> 28:02.552
All I wanna do is put eyes
on my son, Joss.

28:02.714 --> 28:05.661
In case I don't get the chance again.

28:10.989 --> 28:15.699
- Sir? Ms. Morgan.
- Ms. Morgan.

28:15.861 --> 28:18.171
Thank you for meeting with us,
Mr. Wellington.

28:18.330 --> 28:21.868
- And how's our mutual friend?
- She sends her best.

28:22.034 --> 28:25.174
This is John Wiley,
the collector she told you about.

28:25.337 --> 28:27.840
Zoe says you're a man
who can find things no one else can.

28:29.107 --> 28:32.020
She flatters me but it's also true.

28:33.278 --> 28:36.623
I'm looking for a privately owned
Child with Dove.

28:36.782 --> 28:38.455
I'm willing to pay whatever it takes.

28:38.584 --> 28:40.222
Hm.

28:40.285 --> 28:44.700
If you boys will excuse me,
I need to powder my nose.

29:07.279 --> 29:09.725
- Nice entrance.
- Thanks. Where's the safe?

29:11.984 --> 29:14.225
Old school.
Excellent.

29:16.088 --> 29:19.661
You know, proving the kid is Ian's
may not get Wellington off his back.

29:19.825 --> 29:23.068
I'm just the safecracker.
I leave the messy stuff to Harold.

29:25.631 --> 29:27.008
Well, you better hurry up, Shaw.

29:27.165 --> 29:29.167
Looks like Wellington is about
to take his grandson

29:29.334 --> 29:31.314
on a long trip outside the country.

29:38.910 --> 29:40.787
Where are they taking him?

29:40.946 --> 29:42.948
Alex has been enrolled
at a London boarding school.

29:43.115 --> 29:44.235
They leave tomorrow morning.

29:46.184 --> 29:47.754
So it's over.

29:47.919 --> 29:49.039
Even if we get a DNA sample,

29:49.187 --> 29:51.107
that wont stop Wellington
from trying to kill me.

29:51.268 --> 29:53.028
It will if we leverage
the child's paternity.

29:53.103 --> 29:55.200
The Wellington legacy
is all he cares about.

29:55.360 --> 29:58.341
I can assure you, a man like this
will do anything to protect his name.

30:05.804 --> 30:07.875
Excuse me for a moment.

30:13.011 --> 30:14.957
<i>- Black.
- Kilo.</i>

30:15.113 --> 30:17.218
<i>- Tango.
- Penguin.</i>

30:17.382 --> 30:19.555
<i>- Alpha.
- Kilo.</i>

30:19.718 --> 30:21.561
<i>- Two.
- Delta.</i>

30:21.720 --> 30:23.222
<i>Gold.</i>

30:36.968 --> 30:39.073
<i>Stoneridge Hospital.</i>

30:39.237 --> 30:42.582
Yes, hello. I was calling to check up
on Ms. Robin Farrow.

30:42.741 --> 30:44.652
This is her uncle, Harold Wren.

30:44.810 --> 30:48.155
<i>Hello, Mr. Wren.
Robin is doing quite well.</i>

30:48.313 --> 30:51.590
<i>Although you're the second person
to call on her today.</i>

30:51.750 --> 30:52.990
Who was the first?

30:53.151 --> 30:57.065
<i>He wouldn't give us a name, so we
wouldn't give him any information.</i>

31:02.260 --> 31:05.730
- Where's Joseph?
- He called in sick today.

31:07.265 --> 31:10.178
I'm Ian. So buckle up.

31:10.335 --> 31:11.746
I already did.

31:21.413 --> 31:25.623
Mr. Reese, I believe Mr. Murphy
just kidnapped his son.

31:29.287 --> 31:32.734
- Ian's birth certificate isn't here.
- It takes days to run DNA.

31:32.891 --> 31:35.428
- The Wellingtons will leave tomorrow.
- Reese.

31:38.029 --> 31:41.738
You're right, that is a lovely
depiction of postmodernism.

31:41.900 --> 31:44.608
But, may I ask you something?

31:44.770 --> 31:47.273
What's that, Mr. Wiley?

31:47.439 --> 31:49.476
Where is your
grandson's birth certificate?

31:51.376 --> 31:53.413
You stole a child from his father.

31:53.578 --> 31:54.989
Alex has a father.

31:55.147 --> 31:58.492
No. Alex has an aunt and an uncle
who raised him as their own.

31:58.650 --> 32:01.290
I'm going to ask you one more time,
Mr. Wellington.

32:01.453 --> 32:05.799
Where is your grandson's
birth certificate?

32:05.957 --> 32:10.906
My grandson will never know that
piece of white trash is his father.

32:11.062 --> 32:14.509
Alex is an heir, not the help.

32:15.734 --> 32:18.476
Security will show you out.

32:21.740 --> 32:23.845
If you weren't gonna do that,
I was.

32:25.577 --> 32:28.990
Okay.
What do we do now?

32:39.324 --> 32:43.033
- Ian, where are you?
- I just did something really stupid.

32:53.171 --> 32:56.550
I usually go home right after school.

32:57.876 --> 32:59.996
Yeah, I thought we could do
something different today.

33:00.111 --> 33:03.991
Why? What's today?

33:05.383 --> 33:08.387
Well, Alex...

33:11.223 --> 33:14.363
...I knew your mom a long time ago.

33:15.827 --> 33:18.307
Well, she gets mad
if I come home late.

33:21.066 --> 33:25.811
Right.
Well, I'm sure she doesn't...

33:25.971 --> 33:28.542
What I meant to say was that
I knew your Aunt Dana.

33:29.474 --> 33:30.475
Oh.

33:32.544 --> 33:35.320
- Aunt Dana died.
- Yeah, I know.

33:36.248 --> 33:38.592
And I know that makes you really sad.

33:40.519 --> 33:42.556
Makes me sad, too.

33:43.855 --> 33:45.994
To have someone you love
just vanish from your life.

33:46.157 --> 33:50.663
It's hard to understand,
even when you're grown up.

33:50.829 --> 33:52.331
How did you know her?

33:52.497 --> 33:56.206
- From school?
- Yeah.

33:59.337 --> 34:02.614
See? We were good friends.

34:04.910 --> 34:07.390
She used to read me stories
when I was little.

34:08.380 --> 34:12.522
Then I got older
and she let me read to her.

34:14.286 --> 34:16.357
She liked <i>Harry Potter.</i>

34:19.257 --> 34:21.703
I wish I hadn't lost touch with her.

34:22.793 --> 34:24.603
I wish I had...

34:27.197 --> 34:31.772
- ...met you a lot sooner.
- Why?

34:33.138 --> 34:35.083
You seem like someone
I'd really like to know.

34:39.610 --> 34:43.456
Hi, Alex. I'm Officer Carter,
here to take you home.

34:44.449 --> 34:47.987
But first I need to talk to my friend
Ian for a minute.

34:49.420 --> 34:50.991
Tell you what.

34:51.156 --> 34:53.898
Why don't you go buy yourself
an ice cream, okay?

34:54.059 --> 34:55.561
Okay.

34:59.831 --> 35:04.302
I knew it was a stupid move
the second I did it but that's...

35:06.004 --> 35:08.245
I just found out that I have a son.

35:09.441 --> 35:11.944
Now these people, they wanna just
take him away from me again?

35:12.110 --> 35:16.354
I'm not gonna let that happen, Ian,
but we gotta do this right.

35:18.817 --> 35:21.127
Here you go.

35:28.093 --> 35:29.936
Hey.

35:30.028 --> 35:32.975
I never told you
how much I liked the uniform.

35:33.131 --> 35:35.611
- Another line?
- Not even a little.

35:41.640 --> 35:44.382
Friend of mine knows people
who know people

35:44.542 --> 35:47.148
that have dirt on doctors
to the rich and famous.

35:48.380 --> 35:51.054
I'm about to submit that
into evidence.

35:52.217 --> 35:55.790
So... are you ready
to be a father for real?

35:57.355 --> 35:59.460
More than you could possibly know.

35:59.624 --> 36:03.071
I'm happy for you.
And for Alex.

36:04.863 --> 36:06.383
Happy enough to celebrate
over a drink?

36:07.132 --> 36:09.578
Maybe after the dust settles.

36:09.734 --> 36:12.908
- You still have my number.
- Yeah.

36:34.592 --> 36:37.766
What's different
about you tonight, Robin?

36:37.929 --> 36:41.536
I feel relieved.
Like a great weight's been lifted.

36:41.700 --> 36:44.408
I am so pleased to hear that.

36:44.569 --> 36:46.276
It sounds like your
medication is working.

36:48.106 --> 36:52.077
No.
It's finally time for me to leave.

36:54.045 --> 36:57.083
I see. Okay, Robin, the only way
you can leave this facility

36:57.248 --> 37:00.627
is with my signature, which you're
not gonna get any time soon.

37:01.720 --> 37:04.860
You need to start participating
in your therapy.

37:05.023 --> 37:07.936
It's the only way to get well.

37:08.093 --> 37:10.300
I am participating.

37:10.462 --> 37:12.100
And it's been...

37:13.732 --> 37:16.440
...educational, to say the least.

37:17.469 --> 37:19.915
But there's a government operative
who's coming to kill me

37:20.071 --> 37:23.109
which means you
and I have run out of time.

37:23.274 --> 37:27.654
Okay, that sounds to me like
what we call a persecution complex.

37:27.812 --> 37:31.316
Oh, he's quite real, I assure you.

37:32.383 --> 37:36.661
So, you see, sadly...

37:37.722 --> 37:39.395
...I need to be moving on.

37:40.759 --> 37:42.739
Okay. So, um...

37:44.662 --> 37:46.664
...you're going to escape?

37:49.567 --> 37:50.807
How do you plan on doing that?

37:53.605 --> 37:55.346
First the phone on your desk
will ring.

37:55.507 --> 37:57.009
She'll be letting me know it's time.

37:58.076 --> 37:59.749
Then I'll punch you
in the carotid artery.

37:59.911 --> 38:02.187
It'll hurt, Ronald,
but it won't kill you.

38:02.347 --> 38:04.850
Then I'll take your car keys.

38:08.019 --> 38:11.000
And then, the guards,
how will you manage them?

38:11.990 --> 38:13.469
I won't have to.

38:14.926 --> 38:19.705
They'll be incapacitated from the
desflurane in the ventilation system.

38:20.431 --> 38:23.037
It vaporizes at 75 degrees.

38:23.201 --> 38:24.561
Which the building climate control

38:24.702 --> 38:27.273
has been programmed to reach
ten minutes ago.

38:27.438 --> 38:32.353
Okay, this voice that you hear,
she is gonna do all this?

38:32.510 --> 38:34.649
Of course not.

38:35.814 --> 38:37.794
She sees everything,

38:37.949 --> 38:41.897
but there's very little
she can do about it herself.

38:42.053 --> 38:47.025
That's where I come in.
She tells me what to do and I do it.

38:48.493 --> 38:52.066
Well, she did help me a little
with stealing the desflurane

38:52.230 --> 38:54.972
from the automatic dispensing system.

38:55.133 --> 39:00.173
Don't worry. I closed the vents
in your office two days ago.

39:01.306 --> 39:03.684
It should have cleared out by now.

39:09.514 --> 39:11.892
Do you hear
how quiet it is out there?

39:12.917 --> 39:14.419
Must be almost time.

39:18.089 --> 39:21.730
Are you as excited
about this as I am?

39:38.576 --> 39:40.886
How long are you gonna
keep him waiting?

39:41.913 --> 39:45.690
- He promised to walk me home.
- Yeah, that's very chivalrous of him.

39:46.951 --> 39:49.864
Okay, fine.
I should probably get going.

39:50.021 --> 39:55.937
Yeah, I need to go, too.
I have a date. With my son.

39:56.094 --> 39:57.402
Nice work tonight, ladies.

40:00.031 --> 40:01.442
Good night.

40:06.471 --> 40:09.452
What do you think?
You wanna get out of here?

40:10.975 --> 40:14.479
Okay.
But you're sleeping at my place.

40:50.014 --> 40:51.994
Hello, there.

40:54.118 --> 40:58.157
Oh, my God.
What have you done?

40:58.323 --> 41:00.428
Don't worry.
I didn't kill them.

41:01.492 --> 41:03.870
Like you said,
I've been making progress.

41:04.996 --> 41:06.771
The man coming after me,
on the other hand,

41:06.931 --> 41:08.774
will almost certainly kill you, so...

41:09.867 --> 41:12.211
...you probably should run.

41:13.638 --> 41:14.810
Pardon me.

41:49.474 --> 41:50.646
Shh...

42:02.653 --> 42:05.099
Did you really think
she would abandon me?

42:13.765 --> 42:16.371
Really?
Even this guy?

42:20.038 --> 42:22.075
I guess you're the boss.

42:23.608 --> 42:27.681
So long, Doc.
And thanks for all the help.

42:27.845 --> 42:30.758
I think I really am much better now.

43:05.149 --> 43:09.325
Finch, what's wrong?
- Mr. Reese, we have a problem.
