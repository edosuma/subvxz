00:21.624 --> 00:24.659
Commonly accepted methods
for communing with the dead.

00:27.730 --> 00:29.230
As opposed to...

00:32.067 --> 00:33.968
In my culture,
communication with the dead

00:34.036 --> 00:37.005
Is taken very seriously.

00:37.073 --> 00:39.074
Oh. Now you respect it.

00:39.141 --> 00:40.842
You politically correct
trained weasels.

00:40.910 --> 00:45.246
I expect the subject matter
to be taken very seriously.

00:45.314 --> 00:47.282
Yes?

00:47.349 --> 00:49.984
How come you never tell us
if you believe this stuff?

00:50.052 --> 00:51.186
What does it matter?

00:51.253 --> 00:52.587
We're studying trends,

00:52.655 --> 00:55.657
Theories, systems of beliefs
that effect people.

00:55.725 --> 00:58.293
Small subsets of people.

00:58.360 --> 01:00.895
Like those who first believe
that the earth is round.

01:00.963 --> 01:02.630
But it is.
Oh.

01:02.698 --> 01:04.099
Been to outer space,
have you?

01:04.166 --> 01:07.235
Seen the earth in all
of its rounded glory?

01:07.303 --> 01:09.771
I'm just saying.
As per usual,

01:09.839 --> 01:11.840
Some of you will
find this all absurd

01:11.907 --> 01:14.943
And have a good laugh at it
over your next game of beer pong.

01:15.010 --> 01:17.278
Others of you,
for whatever reason,

01:17.346 --> 01:19.781
May find it
a little too real.

01:25.588 --> 01:28.223
I told you,
I already have a t.A.

01:28.290 --> 01:29.758
He's an econ major.

01:29.825 --> 01:32.093
You need someone who's
serious about the field.

01:32.161 --> 01:33.762
Here.

01:33.829 --> 01:35.630
Look at this, ok?

01:35.698 --> 01:36.931
Oh, wow,
nice spirit board.

01:36.999 --> 01:39.267
Where'd you get it?

01:39.335 --> 01:41.903
I scope garage sales for a
secondhand store I work at.

01:41.971 --> 01:43.371
Yeah, it's rare.

01:43.439 --> 01:44.472
I could have someone
look at it

01:44.540 --> 01:46.808
If you're trying
to find a price.

01:50.246 --> 01:53.148
It's a gift. For you.

01:53.215 --> 01:54.916
It might be worth
something.

01:54.984 --> 01:56.351
Sell it at the store
you work for.

01:56.418 --> 01:57.752
I can't.

01:57.820 --> 02:00.522
The woman who owns it,
well, let's just say

02:00.589 --> 02:02.957
She's not really a fan
of this kind of thing.

02:03.025 --> 02:05.994
Oh, an occult prude?
Not exactly.

02:06.061 --> 02:07.729
But really,
you should have it.

02:07.797 --> 02:08.997
Don't worry.

02:09.064 --> 02:10.131
You're going
to ace this course,

02:10.199 --> 02:11.900
So you don't have
to suck up to me.

02:11.967 --> 02:13.268
That's not what I'm doing.

02:13.335 --> 02:15.370
Then what
are you doing?

02:17.540 --> 02:19.207
Is that a concert flyer??

02:22.011 --> 02:24.012
Trey...

02:24.079 --> 02:26.247
Where did you get this?
Get what?

02:26.315 --> 02:27.549
This flyer.

02:27.616 --> 02:28.716
Who put it on my door?

02:28.784 --> 02:31.186
Oh, sorry.

02:31.253 --> 02:33.021
I know you want messages
handed to you,

02:33.088 --> 02:34.289
But it's not my fault.

02:34.356 --> 02:35.824
I didn't see anyone
put it there.

02:35.891 --> 02:37.992
Hmm.

02:54.577 --> 02:56.010
Did you just do that?

02:57.179 --> 02:58.680
No.

03:01.217 --> 03:03.151
Did someone tell you
I like that band?

03:03.219 --> 03:05.420
No.

03:05.487 --> 03:08.389
But who would
know that?

03:08.457 --> 03:09.824
Maybe the spirit
board knows.

03:09.892 --> 03:12.527
For a clean-cut kid,
you're a little odd.

03:12.595 --> 03:14.562
I know.
Come on in.

03:20.035 --> 03:22.303
I've got it covered,
trey. Go.

03:26.709 --> 03:28.109
Have you ever used
one of these before?

03:28.177 --> 03:29.210
No.

03:29.278 --> 03:30.478
But you must have,
right?

03:30.546 --> 03:32.747
I mean,
in your course of study?

03:32.815 --> 03:35.617
In eighth grade,
at a slumber party,

03:35.684 --> 03:38.820
Marie antoinette told my friend
sintra she liked her clothes.

03:38.888 --> 03:42.190
Did I mention sintra
was holding the planchette?

03:42.258 --> 03:45.927
Why don't we ask
about the flyer?

03:45.995 --> 03:47.328
Hmm.

03:49.632 --> 03:52.734
Should professor avery
go to the concert tomorrow?

03:52.801 --> 03:55.436
ned: Whoa!

03:59.275 --> 04:01.776
Did you do that?
No.

04:01.844 --> 04:03.611
Come on!

04:03.679 --> 04:05.647
Look...

04:05.714 --> 04:08.216
Somebody wants you
to go to that concert.

04:08.284 --> 04:09.951
Somebody dead.

04:11.587 --> 04:13.087
Office hours are over.

04:13.155 --> 04:16.190
I'm sorry.
I didn't...

04:16.257 --> 04:17.625
You can leave the board
if you want to.

04:36.679 --> 04:39.147
So did you make
any inroads?

04:39.214 --> 04:41.649
I still don't know why you
want this t.A. Job so bad.

04:41.717 --> 04:43.584
I'd have access
to the faculty libraries.

04:43.652 --> 04:46.554
Including
the copeland wing.

04:46.622 --> 04:48.389
That's where the drake
collection was originally housed.

04:48.457 --> 04:49.757
I can't even
go in there.

04:49.825 --> 04:50.892
You have to be
with that department.

04:50.960 --> 04:52.460
It's where we found
the book of changes.

04:52.528 --> 04:53.928
Who knows what else
is buried in there?

04:53.996 --> 04:56.264
So you want to do it to find
out more about the shadows?

04:56.332 --> 04:57.832
I've been researching for
months trying to find something,

04:57.900 --> 05:01.169
I mean, anything,
about whatever they are.

05:01.236 --> 05:04.172
But I keep coming up dry.
The copeland wing...

05:04.239 --> 05:07.141
Academics from everywhere
do occult research there.

05:07.209 --> 05:08.343
Weird looking guys, too.

05:08.410 --> 05:10.011
Some with accents,
funny hats.

05:10.079 --> 05:12.280
Ok, I thought we were
talking about a ghost.

05:12.348 --> 05:14.615
Yes, and if I can help get
it away from professor grant.

05:14.683 --> 05:16.718
That's if the ghost who flipped
the spirit board even knows her.

05:16.785 --> 05:18.152
Look, this spirit
could be anybody, ok?

05:18.220 --> 05:20.722
That's the problem
with those stupid boards.

05:20.789 --> 05:23.491
They upset ghosts who are
desperate to communicate;

05:23.559 --> 05:25.660
Gets them frustrated,
and then you end up with...

05:25.728 --> 05:27.195
Frustrated, upset ghost.
Exactly.

05:27.262 --> 05:29.297
There's something
about that concert.

05:29.365 --> 05:31.099
And professor grant
knew it, too.

05:31.166 --> 05:32.633
She seemed
kind of freaked out.

05:32.701 --> 05:34.102
She does have
a dead ex-boyfriend.

05:34.169 --> 05:35.770
Fiancé, technically.

05:35.838 --> 05:37.171
Car accident.

05:37.239 --> 05:38.272
I thought
you didn't know her,

05:38.340 --> 05:39.507
That you guys ran in
different circles.

05:39.575 --> 05:41.209
Circles of guys
she hooked up with,

05:41.276 --> 05:43.478
Briefly dates,
and then dumps.

05:43.545 --> 05:44.612
I heard many sad stories.

05:44.680 --> 05:45.913
Fine. What do we
know about her?

05:45.981 --> 05:48.216
Well, I found a link
to her webpage.

05:49.752 --> 05:51.119
Wow.

05:51.186 --> 05:52.787
Tribute much?

05:52.855 --> 05:56.791
Not to be insensitive, but this
is a shrine to her ex-fiancé.

05:58.527 --> 06:00.628
I mean, piece of cake.

06:00.696 --> 06:01.996
He's gotta be our ghost.

06:02.064 --> 06:03.965
Am I right?

06:04.033 --> 06:05.867
I'll keep
my eyes open.

06:05.934 --> 06:07.902
Thanks for lunch.
Yeah, sure.

06:07.970 --> 06:10.138
Thanks.
Hey, all right, yeah.

06:10.205 --> 06:11.672
I don't have any money.

06:44.440 --> 06:45.940
Listen,

06:46.008 --> 06:47.442
This might be
a little awkward,

06:47.509 --> 06:50.912
But I think we have more in
common than you might think.

06:51.013 --> 06:53.114
Ned, we need
to have a talk

06:53.182 --> 06:55.983
About a little thing called
"boundaries." ever heard of them?

06:57.386 --> 06:59.821
What concert?

06:59.888 --> 07:02.390
I did not put this
on my date book.

07:02.458 --> 07:03.925
Do you see what's
happening here?

07:03.992 --> 07:06.627
No more office visits,
no more bringing me presents,

07:06.695 --> 07:08.463
And no more trying to get me
to go to this concert with you.

07:08.530 --> 07:11.866
With me? I think
you have the wrong idea.

07:11.934 --> 07:13.401
And what are you
even thinking?

07:13.469 --> 07:14.769
With your spooky,
invasive magic tricks.

07:14.837 --> 07:15.870
They're not
magic tricks.

07:15.938 --> 07:18.039
The flying spirit board,

07:18.107 --> 07:19.073
The flowers you left me?

07:19.141 --> 07:20.541
I didn't do
any of that.

07:20.609 --> 07:22.877
Then how did you find out
about my favorite band?

07:22.945 --> 07:24.812
You're haunted.

07:24.880 --> 07:27.215
My friends don't
think so, but...

07:27.282 --> 07:29.150
I'm haunted?
What friends?

07:29.218 --> 07:31.152
I think there's
a spirit.

07:31.220 --> 07:32.587
The board awakened it,

07:32.654 --> 07:34.655
And I'm sorry
for my role in that.

07:34.723 --> 07:36.824
But I don't think it's
going to stop pestering you

07:36.892 --> 07:38.159
Until you
acknowledge it.

07:38.227 --> 07:40.895
You're nuts, and you need
to transfer out of my class.

07:40.963 --> 07:43.331
But this is...
I'm asking you to leave.

08:35.000 --> 08:40.000
<<By ABBI>>

09:00.480 --> 09:01.781
You're nuts.

09:01.849 --> 09:03.683
According to ned,
those were her exact words.

09:03.751 --> 09:04.951
So she teaches
the paranormal,

09:05.019 --> 09:06.319
But she doesn't
believe in it?

09:06.387 --> 09:08.588
Hey, if I bought into every
psychological theory I teach,

09:08.656 --> 09:10.457
I would have
murdered my parents.

09:10.524 --> 09:12.659
Hey, how are they?
Honestly? Thriving.

09:12.727 --> 09:14.394
I mean, for a couple
of dead people.

09:14.462 --> 09:17.697
I think they're haunting
my aunt shirley in boca.

09:21.769 --> 09:23.536
That's not exactly romantic.

09:23.604 --> 09:24.604
You can't even
dance to it.

09:24.672 --> 09:25.805
Well, maybe it was
something special

09:25.873 --> 09:27.140
She shared
with her fiancé,

09:27.208 --> 09:28.341
If he's even
the ghost.

09:28.409 --> 09:30.377
The guy's sending her flowers
from the grave;

09:30.444 --> 09:31.978
Setting up concert dates
with her.

09:32.046 --> 09:33.713
Who else could it be?
Anybody,

09:33.781 --> 09:34.781
Thanks
to the spirit board.

09:34.849 --> 09:36.516
Ok, I get it,
you hate them.

09:36.584 --> 09:37.717
Because they're like writing
your number on the bathroom wall

09:37.785 --> 09:39.085
For the dead.

09:39.153 --> 09:40.920
And maybe ned told avery
about the ghost too soon.

09:40.988 --> 09:42.655
But he was doing it
trying to help us

09:42.723 --> 09:44.524
Get into the copeland wing.
So we gotta help him.

09:44.592 --> 09:47.394
That's her,
with the chair.

09:50.431 --> 09:52.432
That's just academics.
Hey!

09:52.500 --> 09:53.466
I resemble that remark.

09:53.534 --> 09:54.901
No, I mean,
in this area.

09:54.969 --> 09:56.069
Whether they believe it
or not,

09:56.137 --> 09:57.303
They all think
they're experts.

09:57.371 --> 09:58.405
And not only do I have
to convince them

09:58.472 --> 10:00.006
That I can see ghosts,

10:00.074 --> 10:02.108
But then they have to unlearn
everything they think they know.

10:02.176 --> 10:04.377
hello?

10:04.445 --> 10:07.380
I told you, I was
going to a concert.

10:07.448 --> 10:08.415
Poor thing.

10:08.482 --> 10:10.350
Whatever she said to ned,
she still came.

10:10.418 --> 10:11.918
To meet her dead fiancé.

10:11.986 --> 10:13.153
What faculty meeting?

10:13.220 --> 10:15.288
With president bedford?

10:15.356 --> 10:17.357
What wasn't it
on my calendar?

10:17.425 --> 10:18.591
No, it wasn't.
All right,

10:18.659 --> 10:20.393
I'm 10 minutes away. Oh!

10:24.899 --> 10:26.766
Uh...

10:29.870 --> 10:31.571
Oh, yeah, yeah.

10:31.639 --> 10:33.072
I used to have
one of these.

10:33.140 --> 10:35.909
I hated mine, too, so.

10:35.976 --> 10:38.111
There. You ok?

10:38.179 --> 10:40.246
Better than
my phone.

10:40.314 --> 10:41.281
Yeah.
Sorry.

10:41.348 --> 10:42.649
I just...please.

10:42.716 --> 10:45.251
It's fine.

10:45.319 --> 10:46.920
Fine.

10:46.987 --> 10:48.455
Set it up.

10:51.325 --> 10:54.194
So you see ghosts
and you talk to them.

10:55.396 --> 10:57.797
You're one of the friends
ned was talking about.

10:57.865 --> 10:59.332
I know it's
a lot to process.

10:59.400 --> 11:02.235
And you think that's why my cell
phone decided to take flight.

11:02.303 --> 11:04.304
At the exact moment you were
thinking about leaving the concert,

11:04.371 --> 11:07.040
Which a ghost went to a lot
of trouble to get you to.

11:08.342 --> 11:09.275
What do you think
happened?

11:09.343 --> 11:11.611
I tripped,
and it flew out of my hand.

11:11.679 --> 11:14.013
Law of physics.
You don't teach physics.

11:14.081 --> 11:15.648
Just because I teach
anthro of the occult

11:15.749 --> 11:17.450
Does not mean I should buy
whatever it is you're selling.

11:17.518 --> 11:19.219
I'm not selling
anything,

11:19.286 --> 11:21.221
Especially to somebody
who doesn't want my help.

11:22.289 --> 11:23.723
But you know what,
feel free to call me

11:23.791 --> 11:25.024
When your ghost
comes back.

11:25.092 --> 11:27.060
Look, I'm sorry.

11:27.127 --> 11:28.495
I'm listening.

11:28.562 --> 11:30.997
Please, tell me
how this works.

11:32.333 --> 11:34.868
First, we have to figure
out who the ghost is.

11:34.935 --> 11:38.238
Logical place to start,
based on the behavior,

11:38.305 --> 11:40.707
Someone who has romantic
feelings for you.

11:40.774 --> 11:42.075
'cause all
the good ones

11:42.142 --> 11:43.810
Are married,
gay or dead, right?

11:43.878 --> 11:46.746
I should
have said "had."

11:49.016 --> 11:52.018
Eli told me about
curtis, your fiancé.

11:53.187 --> 11:54.888
Oh.

11:56.557 --> 11:58.258
Well.

11:58.325 --> 12:00.393
If you're just taking
shots in the dark,

12:00.461 --> 12:04.063
You should be a little more careful
about throwing out names of loved ones.

12:04.131 --> 12:05.131
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to...

12:05.199 --> 12:06.366
Nobody means to.

12:06.433 --> 12:08.368
They just want me
to move on.

12:08.435 --> 12:12.005
Register at some dating sight
and find another soul mate.

12:12.072 --> 12:14.007
Well, I'm old-fashioned.

12:14.074 --> 12:15.808
I think you get one.

12:15.876 --> 12:18.678
I don't expect you
to understand.

12:18.746 --> 12:20.847
I understand better
than you think.

12:22.216 --> 12:25.285
Believe it or not, I think
this ghost is staying here

12:25.352 --> 12:26.886
Because he thinks
you need him.

12:28.222 --> 12:29.422
You have
to let him go.

12:29.490 --> 12:32.592
But if curtis is here,
why would I let him go?

12:32.660 --> 12:35.528
Because spirits
don't belong here.

12:35.596 --> 12:37.597
They belong
in the light.

12:37.665 --> 12:39.065
Who died and made you
the expert?

12:41.135 --> 12:43.303
I know a few things
about ghosts myself,

12:43.370 --> 12:45.338
Or did you forget that?

12:45.406 --> 12:46.706
No.

12:46.774 --> 12:48.608
No, I didn't.

13:06.660 --> 13:09.329
Did I order this?

13:13.434 --> 13:15.602
"the big lebowski."

13:15.669 --> 13:18.504
At least someone
screwed up with taste.

13:27.481 --> 13:28.615
Curtis?

13:31.819 --> 13:33.486
What are you doing?

13:36.790 --> 13:38.491
Popcorn?

13:47.901 --> 13:50.303
Extra butter?

13:50.371 --> 13:54.173
Curtis, if this is you,

13:54.241 --> 13:57.343
You know I like
my popcorn plain.

14:08.322 --> 14:11.991
I can't tell if this is
a seduction or a séance.

14:21.869 --> 14:23.569
Ok.

14:29.843 --> 14:32.779
Well, what's
that about?

14:32.846 --> 14:34.914
You don't want
to watch the movie?

14:37.284 --> 14:39.852
So what
do you want to do?

14:43.524 --> 14:44.991
Talk?

14:46.260 --> 14:49.262
You know how much
I hate texting,

14:49.329 --> 14:52.165
But I'm game.

15:02.743 --> 15:05.244
Curtis, I...

15:05.312 --> 15:08.047
I've been talking
to you out loud

15:08.115 --> 15:10.683
For the past 3 years.

15:10.751 --> 15:14.654
And now, I'm about
5 cats away from crazy,

15:14.722 --> 15:16.456
So if you can
talk to me,

15:16.523 --> 15:18.524
I mean, really
talk back to me,

15:18.592 --> 15:22.428
Now would be such
a good time.

15:28.202 --> 15:31.003
Maybe that woman's right.

15:31.071 --> 15:33.539
Maybe you do belong
in the light.

15:36.076 --> 15:38.978
I can't believe
I'm doing this.

15:41.815 --> 15:43.616
I miss you so much.

15:47.020 --> 15:48.354
Melinda: Don't touch,
I got it covered.

15:48.422 --> 15:50.556
I'm...I'm just
trying to help.

15:50.624 --> 15:52.291
Let me help.
Uh, no? Ok.

15:52.359 --> 15:54.160
You know what,
I'm gonna go.

15:54.228 --> 15:55.695
I'll clear aiden's stuff
out of the way.

15:55.763 --> 15:57.263
No, no, he's in the middle
of a masterpiece.

15:57.331 --> 15:58.865
Look, I already set
the dining room table.

15:58.932 --> 16:01.634
Why don't you and aiden
go outside and play ball?

16:01.702 --> 16:02.802
Right.

16:02.870 --> 16:04.871
Ok. Turkey chili,
20 minutes.

16:04.938 --> 16:06.973
We'll be there.

16:11.345 --> 16:12.612
Hey! You know what,

16:12.679 --> 16:14.814
If you want to talk
to me, just talk, ok?

16:14.882 --> 16:17.450
No games.

16:17.518 --> 16:19.085
Hey! Oh!
You know what?

16:19.153 --> 16:21.821
That is just childish!

16:25.125 --> 16:26.726
Why are you hiding?

16:29.163 --> 16:32.431
No, no! Not my son's
art project!

16:32.499 --> 16:35.601
Will you please stop?!

16:35.669 --> 16:37.336
I just want to have a quiet
evening with my family!

16:37.404 --> 16:39.539
You are ruining
everything!

16:55.340 --> 16:58.174
Look, what I don't understand
is, how can you ruin everything

16:58.242 --> 16:59.342
When you haven't
done anything yet?

16:59.409 --> 17:02.043
Well, I told
dr. Grant and curtis

17:02.111 --> 17:03.045
That they should
move on.

17:03.113 --> 17:05.013
And you think
he has other plans?

17:05.080 --> 17:07.449
Well, luring her
to the square

17:07.517 --> 17:09.084
For a romantic concert,

17:09.152 --> 17:10.286
Sending her flowers.

17:10.353 --> 17:11.987
It's like he doesn't
want to let go.

17:12.055 --> 17:13.422
And who am I
to say he should?

17:13.490 --> 17:15.858
You know,
they're soul mates.

17:15.925 --> 17:17.226
Hmm.

17:17.294 --> 17:18.761
Like us.

17:18.829 --> 17:20.596
oh!

17:21.631 --> 17:23.199
Hospital.

17:23.266 --> 17:24.733
Duty calls.

17:26.169 --> 17:27.536
For both of us.

17:27.604 --> 17:30.039
See ya.

17:30.106 --> 17:32.007
Bye.
Avery, hi.

17:32.075 --> 17:33.075
Is everything ok?

17:33.143 --> 17:35.678
I think I owe you
another apology.

17:35.745 --> 17:37.479
Something strange
happened last night.

17:38.682 --> 17:39.982
I know
I should be happy

17:40.050 --> 17:41.617
Instead of feeling
whatever it is I'm feeling,

17:41.685 --> 17:44.320
But something about
the whole date night

17:44.387 --> 17:46.555
Was just...Off.

17:46.623 --> 17:48.023
And what was it?

17:48.091 --> 17:49.892
I could really
feel him there,

17:49.960 --> 17:53.462
And that was so amazing.

17:53.530 --> 17:55.731
But... but he
wasn't really there.

17:55.799 --> 17:57.900
Having him so close
but not being able

17:57.968 --> 17:59.835
To really be with him...

17:59.903 --> 18:01.937
I know it sounds ungrateful,

18:02.005 --> 18:03.772
But...

18:03.840 --> 18:05.274
It's just not enough.

18:05.342 --> 18:07.176
It's torture.

18:07.244 --> 18:08.878
Maybe you're right.

18:08.945 --> 18:10.980
Maybe the only way
for both of us to heal

18:11.047 --> 18:13.215
Is for curtis
to go into the light.

18:14.384 --> 18:16.619
I can't believe
I'm saying that.

18:16.686 --> 18:19.054
Hey, it doesn't mean that
you love him any less.

18:19.122 --> 18:20.256
I know.

18:20.323 --> 18:22.057
It's just that I have
a problem

18:22.125 --> 18:24.526
With the whole...
Afterlife thing.

18:24.594 --> 18:26.528
I mean,
before the accident,

18:26.596 --> 18:28.264
I was kind of
a closet believer.

18:28.331 --> 18:29.732
I mean, I always maintained
a very healthy,

18:29.799 --> 18:32.434
Scientific skepticism
in public,

18:32.502 --> 18:34.703
But I would go
in the copeland wing

18:34.771 --> 18:36.238
And I would
read those books,

18:36.306 --> 18:39.008
And they rang so true.

18:39.075 --> 18:43.112
After curtis died, I waited and
waited for him to come back to me,

18:43.179 --> 18:45.648
And...He never did.

18:47.050 --> 18:49.551
So you're saying
that the hauntings

18:49.619 --> 18:51.287
And feeling
his presence,

18:51.354 --> 18:54.390
That just started
recently?

18:54.457 --> 18:56.191
Maybe I shouldn't
question it.

18:56.259 --> 18:57.826
Why would it
start now?

18:57.894 --> 18:58.928
What's different?

18:58.995 --> 19:01.430
Are things
worse for you?

19:01.498 --> 19:05.100
Ever since you told me
that curtis was haunting me.

19:05.168 --> 19:06.468
I mean, before that,

19:06.536 --> 19:08.971
I could go the whole day

19:09.039 --> 19:11.140
Or two without
thinking about him,

19:11.207 --> 19:12.708
But now,

19:12.776 --> 19:15.144
I'm more obsessed
with him than ever.

19:20.050 --> 19:21.817
Curtis?

19:21.885 --> 19:23.285
Curtis,
if that's you,

19:23.353 --> 19:24.787
You don't really
have to use the board.

19:24.854 --> 19:27.056
I can see you
and hear you,

19:27.123 --> 19:28.557
So you could just talk...

19:32.095 --> 19:34.496
Or we can
do it your way.

19:47.143 --> 19:48.210
"curtis is..."

19:48.278 --> 19:49.778
"gone."
that's the message

19:49.846 --> 19:51.880
The ghost spelled out
on the spirit board.

19:51.948 --> 19:53.716
If curtis is gone, then
who's controlling the board?

19:53.783 --> 19:54.850
Maybe we have
the wrong ghost.

19:54.918 --> 19:56.118
Wouldn't be
the first time.

19:56.186 --> 19:57.353
That would explain
the message

19:57.420 --> 19:59.455
I got on my new
board last night.

19:59.522 --> 20:01.557
You got a new board?

20:01.624 --> 20:03.158
It said,
"I'm not curtis,"

20:03.226 --> 20:04.793
Which would
make sense if...

20:04.861 --> 20:05.961
You bought yourself
another board?

20:06.029 --> 20:08.530
Look, I know how you
guys feel about them,

20:08.598 --> 20:11.133
But you don't understand
what it's like for me.

20:11.201 --> 20:12.701
I'm not a sensitive,

20:12.769 --> 20:14.269
And I just thought
if I could...

20:16.840 --> 20:18.707
I don't know
what I was thinking.

20:18.775 --> 20:20.642
You really don't, if you actually
wish you could hear what I hear.

20:20.710 --> 20:23.645
But I guess it proves the ghost was
attached to grant and not the board.

20:23.713 --> 20:25.414
Right.

20:25.482 --> 20:28.117
Do you know anyone else
in her life who died recently?

20:28.184 --> 20:31.220
Professor nettinger was her
mentor in the anthro department.

20:31.287 --> 20:32.621
He died a few months ago.
But the guy was like 104,

20:32.689 --> 20:34.089
So I'm guessing
he wasn't making

20:34.157 --> 20:36.291
With the romance.

20:36.359 --> 20:38.394
Wait, her grandmother.

20:38.461 --> 20:40.396
How do you know that?
They were close.

20:40.463 --> 20:42.965
And she died last spring.
And according to my friend,

20:43.033 --> 20:44.400
Grandma was always
pushing avery

20:44.467 --> 20:45.801
To get on
with her life

20:45.869 --> 20:47.569
And date guys she'd only
kick to the curb.

20:47.637 --> 20:49.872
Fits the profile
of the ghost.

20:49.939 --> 20:51.907
I was thinking the ghost
couldn't be a guy.

20:51.975 --> 20:53.575
How come?

20:53.643 --> 20:56.245
Dude, the ghost
left a glitter note.

21:05.989 --> 21:07.756
Ok.

21:07.824 --> 21:09.925
My ghost consultants
now tell me

21:09.993 --> 21:12.261
That I may be communicating
with you, nana.

21:12.328 --> 21:13.896
Is that true?

21:13.963 --> 21:15.998
Nana, you don't have
to use the board.

21:16.066 --> 21:17.766
There's a lady in town
who talks to ghosts,

21:17.834 --> 21:20.269
And, uh, she might be
my new best friend.

21:20.336 --> 21:22.171
Or a complete whack job.

21:22.238 --> 21:24.506
Possibly both.

21:26.009 --> 21:29.411
I know you want me to go
out there and meet new guys.

21:29.479 --> 21:30.646
How about this?

21:30.713 --> 21:34.183
I promise to start
shaving my legs

21:34.250 --> 21:36.218
And putting on lipstick
before I go to the market

21:36.286 --> 21:38.821
If you promise
to go into the light.

21:38.888 --> 21:41.623
But I can't promise
that I'll ever feel

21:41.691 --> 21:43.425
What I felt for curtis.

21:45.495 --> 21:47.329
Is this supposed to be
the silent treatment?

21:47.397 --> 21:50.699
Ugh! Why isn't there
a star 69 on this thing?

21:50.767 --> 21:52.835
Ugh! Ok, fine!

22:17.227 --> 22:19.728
"the big lebowski," how did
this get back in the machine?

22:39.709 --> 22:43.544
Clavus ferreus,
malleus ferreus,

22:43.611 --> 22:48.080
Ferrum refilium,
ferrum nobilis.

22:48.819 --> 22:51.787
My parents thought
my degree would be useless.

22:51.855 --> 22:54.824
not so useless
now, huh, mom?

22:56.626 --> 22:58.160
Actually...

22:58.228 --> 22:59.962
I don't know.

23:02.799 --> 23:05.334
Get this chucky doll
out of my life.

23:07.103 --> 23:08.905
Professor grant,

23:08.973 --> 23:11.774
Quince seed, sage,
spirit circles...

23:12.342 --> 23:13.910
This stuff's
not going to help.

23:13.978 --> 23:15.412
Well, your friend,
then, tell her,

23:15.479 --> 23:16.880
Whatever potions she has,

23:16.947 --> 23:18.181
Just to bring them on.

23:18.249 --> 23:19.282
That's not
how it works.

23:19.350 --> 23:20.917
This ghost wants to
reach you somehow.

23:20.985 --> 23:22.952
Well, whoever's calling me,

23:23.020 --> 23:25.889
My phone is off the hook
and I am not answering!

23:27.992 --> 23:30.260
Hello?!

23:31.862 --> 23:33.530
I was being
metaphorical!

23:36.400 --> 23:38.001
What do you want from me?

23:44.141 --> 23:45.742
It's the scratched disk.

23:45.810 --> 23:47.310
I never returned it.

23:47.378 --> 23:50.013
Maybe that's what
it wants you to do.

23:50.080 --> 23:53.616
The ghost is trying to get
me to return an overdue dvd?

23:53.684 --> 23:55.652
That makes no sense.
Not yet.

23:55.719 --> 23:58.121
Not until we go to the store
and find out what else it wants.

23:58.189 --> 23:59.923
I'm on my way
to the square right now.

23:59.990 --> 24:01.424
Let me give you a lift,

24:01.492 --> 24:03.293
And maybe we can put an end
to this thing once and for all.

24:11.802 --> 24:14.070
There really should be
some kind of express line

24:14.138 --> 24:15.505
For people
with haunted disks.

24:15.573 --> 24:16.973
Got that right.

24:17.041 --> 24:18.741
What does the ghost
expect me to find in here?

24:18.809 --> 24:20.043
I already rented
every good movie,

24:20.110 --> 24:21.644
Which is not a lot.

24:25.216 --> 24:27.383
Look out!

24:35.693 --> 24:38.061
Whoa. Are you ok?

24:39.129 --> 24:41.064
Wait...
Uh-huh.

24:45.236 --> 24:47.570
Wow.

24:50.207 --> 24:53.576
Now, don't I know you?

24:53.644 --> 24:55.078
I think so.

24:55.145 --> 24:57.180
The concert
in the square.

24:57.248 --> 24:58.581
You threw
your phone at me.

24:58.649 --> 24:59.949
I didn't throw it at you,

25:00.017 --> 25:01.718
It just kind of fell out
of my hands.

25:01.785 --> 25:03.019
I can't explain it.

25:03.087 --> 25:05.755
Well, I can explain it,
but never mind.

25:05.823 --> 25:06.890
You're kidding me.

25:06.957 --> 25:09.092
You're the one
who's late with this?

25:09.159 --> 25:10.193
I've been waiting
for this.

25:10.261 --> 25:11.895
You're here to rent
"the big lebowski"?

25:11.962 --> 25:13.363
It's the best coen brothers movie ever.

25:13.430 --> 25:15.532
Uh, best coen brothers comedy.

25:15.599 --> 25:16.766
Aren't they all?

25:16.834 --> 25:18.768
You may have a point.

25:21.505 --> 25:23.806
Well, what are
the odds, huh?

25:25.109 --> 25:26.609
Maybe not so bad.

25:26.677 --> 25:29.946
No, not bad at all.

25:30.014 --> 25:31.748
Excuse me.

25:38.255 --> 25:40.323
All right.

25:43.027 --> 25:44.427
surprise.

25:44.495 --> 25:46.930
Hey, I was hoping
you guys would come by.

25:46.997 --> 25:49.032
Oh, aiden twisted my arm.

25:49.099 --> 25:50.366
I made this for you
at school.

25:50.434 --> 25:52.402
It was really,
really hard.

25:52.469 --> 25:54.170
Oh, it's really
beautiful.

25:54.238 --> 25:55.605
You know what, I better put this away,

25:55.673 --> 25:56.739
'cause somebody's
going to want to buy it.

26:01.712 --> 26:03.846
What's that
doing here?

26:03.914 --> 26:05.348
Ah, oh, it's another
one of ned's.

26:05.416 --> 26:06.482
I made him leave it.

26:06.550 --> 26:08.017
I thought those
were only for teenage girls

26:08.085 --> 26:09.519
To scare themselves with
at slumber parties.

26:09.587 --> 26:11.654
Uh, that, too, but
there's more than one thing

26:11.722 --> 26:12.722
That can make
the pointer move.

26:12.790 --> 26:14.057
Oh, really?

26:14.124 --> 26:15.325
Other than the unconscious
muscle movements

26:15.392 --> 26:16.593
Called ideomotor response?

26:16.660 --> 26:18.595
You believe whatever you
want there, doctor man.

26:18.662 --> 26:20.763
I used to,
but then I met this girl...

26:20.831 --> 26:22.332
Aiden: Mom?

26:22.399 --> 26:24.834
This board...

26:24.902 --> 26:26.502
You know what,
baby, that's mommy's.

26:26.570 --> 26:30.573
We're just gonna... we're
gonna put that away, ok?

26:30.641 --> 26:31.774
It talks.

26:31.842 --> 26:33.509
It talks?

26:33.577 --> 26:35.578
What does it say?
It says,

26:35.646 --> 26:38.181
It still won't
give her peace?

26:39.248 --> 26:40.650
Give who peace?

26:43.487 --> 26:44.620
Her.

27:06.354 --> 27:08.389
All right, there you go.
Ok.

27:08.456 --> 27:11.458
What, a girl with a
bloody head? How bloody?

27:11.526 --> 27:12.826
She's a ghost.

27:12.894 --> 27:15.529
But what does this have
to do with professor grant?

27:16.497 --> 27:17.498
You know what,

27:17.565 --> 27:20.000
Ned's out there, so let me
see if he knows something.

27:20.067 --> 27:21.535
Right.

27:27.175 --> 27:29.109
Oh, that's beautiful.

27:29.177 --> 27:30.210
That's...that's funny.

27:30.278 --> 27:31.411
This your doing?

27:31.479 --> 27:34.581
No. It's the ghost,
whoever he is.

27:34.649 --> 27:36.483
Oh, we got a problem.

27:36.551 --> 27:38.285
You said you didn't really
get a chance to see it,

27:38.353 --> 27:39.386
And, uh, I got...

27:39.454 --> 27:41.421
Melinda:
You mean she.

27:41.489 --> 27:43.223
Professor grant's grandmother?

27:43.291 --> 27:44.758
She's here?

27:44.826 --> 27:47.227
Not unless she had kids
at a very young age.

27:47.295 --> 27:49.563
I don't know if you're going
to be able to watch it either,

27:49.631 --> 27:51.732
'cause I think it's scratched. Oh, yeah?

27:51.799 --> 27:54.234
I mean, maybe I could come
over and watch it, but...

27:58.139 --> 27:59.439
That sounded so smarmy.

27:59.507 --> 28:01.608
Um, there's something wrong
with my dvd player.

28:01.676 --> 28:03.043
I was not inviting
myself.

28:03.111 --> 28:04.344
Stop it, that was me.

28:04.412 --> 28:06.647
I was angling inviting you

28:06.714 --> 28:10.217
In my most smarmalicious
kind of way.

28:10.285 --> 28:12.085
Really? 'cause it was
really awkward.

28:12.153 --> 28:14.221
Why are you smiling
about it?

28:14.289 --> 28:15.789
'cause I think you're just
as bad at this as I am.

28:15.857 --> 28:16.790
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

28:16.858 --> 28:19.226
I need to get out
of the house more.

28:19.294 --> 28:22.262
Yeah, tell me about it.

28:22.330 --> 28:25.432
Ok, why do I keep feeling
like I've seen you before?

28:25.500 --> 28:27.434
More than the concert
or the video store?

28:27.502 --> 28:29.136
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:29.204 --> 28:31.138
Oh, I know what it is.

28:31.206 --> 28:33.173
The taj mahal.

28:33.241 --> 28:34.675
Not the one in india.

28:34.776 --> 28:36.610
Mini putt!
Mm-hmm.

28:36.678 --> 28:37.678
I love that place.

28:37.745 --> 28:39.346
The best mini golf
in the tri-state area.

28:39.414 --> 28:42.115
Oh, the world!

28:42.183 --> 28:44.484
You know, I know people go
there ironically and stuff,

28:44.552 --> 28:48.121
But...It's beautiful
there at night, you know?

28:48.189 --> 28:49.923
It's like this tiny,
perfect world

28:49.991 --> 28:53.627
Where nothing bad
can ever happen.

28:53.695 --> 28:54.728
Yeah.

28:54.796 --> 28:56.296
It's not like here, huh?

28:56.364 --> 28:57.397
No.

29:00.668 --> 29:04.838
You want to go get
a coffee or something?

29:12.046 --> 29:14.014
Ooh!

29:18.419 --> 29:21.655
Why is there a tweenager
haunting avery?

29:21.723 --> 29:24.925
And why'd she work so hard
to get those two together?

29:25.927 --> 29:28.328
Nothing, nothing
was right at all.

29:28.396 --> 29:30.864
And, you know,
we parted ways.

29:30.932 --> 29:32.866
That's all.
But we still talk,

29:32.934 --> 29:35.402
Sometimes.
Not so much.

29:36.638 --> 29:38.205
Oh, god, how many rules
does that break,

29:38.273 --> 29:40.707
Talking about my divorce
on the first date?

29:40.775 --> 29:42.676
If that's even
what this is.

29:42.744 --> 29:45.679
It is for me
if it is for you.

29:45.747 --> 29:47.080
good.

29:47.148 --> 29:48.849
Tell me a little bit
about you,

29:48.916 --> 29:51.151
'cause honestly, I...

29:51.219 --> 29:52.819
I can't believe
you're single.

29:52.887 --> 29:54.288
Well...

29:54.355 --> 29:59.359
The truth is, I don't really
consider myself single.

29:59.427 --> 30:00.427
Mm-hmm. Why?

30:00.495 --> 30:03.497
My fiancé died
in a car accident.

30:03.564 --> 30:05.232
Oh, my god,
I'm so sorry.

30:05.300 --> 30:07.768
A car accident?

30:07.835 --> 30:10.871
Yeah, if it had been
a couple of weeks later,

30:10.938 --> 30:12.239
We would
have been married

30:12.307 --> 30:14.775
And I would officially be a widow,

30:14.842 --> 30:17.678
Which maybe people
would understand better.

30:17.745 --> 30:21.448
Mm-mmm. No, no,
they'd never understand.

30:21.516 --> 30:24.751
Avery, the only people
that understand

30:24.852 --> 30:26.386
Are people
that lived through it.

30:26.454 --> 30:27.587
Did you?

30:27.655 --> 30:28.922
My daughter.

30:28.990 --> 30:31.224
Oh...

30:31.292 --> 30:34.461
Also car accident,
3 years ago.

30:34.529 --> 30:36.797
I was driving.

30:36.864 --> 30:37.931
I'm so sorry.

30:37.999 --> 30:41.034
You never get over
something like that, never.

30:43.304 --> 30:46.773
Uh, the other guy was
wrong side of the road.

30:46.841 --> 30:50.110
And this was
3 years ago?

30:52.480 --> 30:55.248
And what road
was this?

30:55.316 --> 30:57.417
Covington ridge.

30:57.485 --> 30:59.186
Covington ridge road?

30:59.253 --> 31:01.154
Mm-hmm.

31:01.222 --> 31:03.757
That's the road
curtis was killed on.

31:03.825 --> 31:05.692
It's those blind curves.
I mean, the other guy,

31:05.760 --> 31:07.594
He was just...
he was killed instantly.

31:07.662 --> 31:09.963
And, what was
his name? Um...

31:14.068 --> 31:16.169
Henry c. Flood.

31:16.237 --> 31:18.972
You said
your fiancé's name...

31:19.040 --> 31:22.008
His middle name
was curtis.

31:22.076 --> 31:23.744
Oh, god.

31:23.811 --> 31:25.312
And you said...

31:25.380 --> 31:29.082
January 12th, 8:28.

31:29.150 --> 31:32.753
You were driving the car
that killed curtis.

31:32.820 --> 31:35.789
And madison.

31:39.460 --> 31:41.795
Who is doing this?!

31:41.863 --> 31:43.697
What do you mean?

31:43.765 --> 31:45.198
Who wants me
to feel this pain?

31:45.266 --> 31:46.700
What do you mean? Avery?

31:46.768 --> 31:49.603
Do you think this is
a coincidence?

31:49.670 --> 31:51.872
I don't know. I...avery!

31:51.939 --> 31:53.840
I'm sorry, I can't.

31:53.908 --> 31:56.176
Avery, wait!

31:59.614 --> 32:01.314
Eli: Pizza's here.

32:01.382 --> 32:02.749
What do you want to drink?

32:02.817 --> 32:04.418
Anything. I found it.

32:04.485 --> 32:06.686
Thank god. I thought I was
really going to have to make good

32:06.754 --> 32:08.021
On my offer
to help you inventory.

32:08.089 --> 32:10.457
Ah, check it out,
I've ided our ghost.

32:10.525 --> 32:12.259
Brian and his daughter
madison.

32:12.326 --> 32:13.827
But it says they only
had minor injuries.

32:13.895 --> 32:15.195
Ah, that's what
they thought at first.

32:15.263 --> 32:17.130
But look at this piece
from 2 weeks later.

32:17.198 --> 32:18.999
2 weeks after the accident
she got a headache

32:19.066 --> 32:20.367
During a volleyball game.

32:20.435 --> 32:21.935
By that night,
she was in a coma.

32:22.003 --> 32:23.937
She died of an epidural
hematoma.

32:24.005 --> 32:26.106
This is why we didn't come
up with her name before.

32:26.174 --> 32:27.908
It's possible.
Not even avery knew.

32:27.975 --> 32:29.810
Why would madison
haunt dr. Grant?

32:29.877 --> 32:32.012
She wasn't driving
the car that killed her.

32:32.079 --> 32:36.082
Hmm, first article, officials blame
texting and driving for the accident.

32:36.150 --> 32:38.752
Curtis was answering a text
at the time of the crash.

32:38.820 --> 32:40.720
What if it was a text
from dr. Grant?

32:40.788 --> 32:42.289
Hmm, that would explain
why the ghost blames avery,

32:42.356 --> 32:45.625
But not why the hauntings
just started recently.

32:48.629 --> 32:50.930
Why good-bye?
Is somebody leaving?

32:53.400 --> 32:54.434
Leaving how?

32:59.172 --> 33:02.074
What does that mean?
Someone's going to die?

33:04.478 --> 33:07.546
When? Does it mean that
somebody's going to die soon?

33:15.522 --> 33:17.090
hello?
Avery, it's melinda.

33:17.091 --> 33:19.058
Where are you?
I'm driving. What is it?

33:19.126 --> 33:21.461
Where are you going?
I need to talk to curtis.

33:21.528 --> 33:23.063
Avery, please
just listen to me...

33:23.131 --> 33:25.431
Please just
leave me alone!

33:45.724 --> 33:47.759
Where's my purse, and my keys?

33:47.827 --> 33:49.627
But we don't know if the spirit
board meant it was dr. Grant

33:49.695 --> 33:51.529
Who was going to die, or if
the ghost was threatening her.

33:51.597 --> 33:52.831
Do you really want
to take that chance?

33:52.898 --> 33:54.332
Of course not,
but how do we find her?

33:54.600 --> 33:55.900
I don't know.

33:56.368 --> 33:57.436
She said
she was in her car,

33:57.503 --> 33:58.670
That she needed
to talk to curtis,

33:58.738 --> 33:59.938
So where would she go
to talk to him?

34:00.006 --> 34:01.206
Ah...

34:01.274 --> 34:02.774
Wait a minute.

34:05.144 --> 34:07.479
His obit said
he was cremated.

34:07.547 --> 34:08.980
No service to bury
his ashes or anything.

34:09.047 --> 34:11.583
Ok, so what else would be
a meaningful place for them?

34:11.650 --> 34:13.752
I don't know, her website
listed dozens of places

34:13.820 --> 34:15.786
They liked to go together.

34:15.855 --> 34:17.822
Maybe she went to
the crash site

34:17.889 --> 34:19.524
At covington ridge road.

34:33.672 --> 34:35.773
I called 9-1-1!

34:35.841 --> 34:38.208
Help is on the way!

34:38.277 --> 34:40.178
Ok.

34:41.947 --> 34:44.181
avery...

34:44.250 --> 34:47.252
Brian!
Avery, it's you!

34:47.319 --> 34:48.652
What are you
doing here?

34:48.721 --> 34:49.754
Oh, god.
I was driving,

34:49.822 --> 34:51.723
I saw dust and smoke.
Are you all right?

34:51.790 --> 34:53.224
Are you hurt?
No, I don't think so.

34:53.292 --> 34:54.425
You sure?
Yeah.

34:54.493 --> 34:57.395
Ok. Ok.

34:57.463 --> 34:59.364
Ok. You sure
nothing hurts?

34:59.431 --> 35:02.500
No. I think I'm more
rattled than anything else.

35:02.568 --> 35:04.035
Ok.

35:04.103 --> 35:05.036
Ok.

35:05.104 --> 35:07.338
Come on. Ok.

35:10.142 --> 35:11.409
Ok.

35:15.714 --> 35:17.515
All right, now,
I want you to move everything

35:17.583 --> 35:18.983
Just to see
if anything's broken.

35:19.051 --> 35:22.120
Ah, I'm fine.
Thank you.

35:22.187 --> 35:24.188
You're all right.

35:24.256 --> 35:25.523
It's ok.

35:25.591 --> 35:27.692
Why were you
driving on that road?

35:27.760 --> 35:29.027
What do you mean?

35:29.094 --> 35:30.628
Were you...
following you?

35:30.696 --> 35:31.696
No, avery.

35:31.764 --> 35:32.830
This can't be
another coincidence.

35:32.898 --> 35:33.898
It's not.

35:33.966 --> 35:36.834
It's where
the accident happened.

35:38.237 --> 35:40.738
I come here all the time.
Why?

35:40.806 --> 35:42.740
Avery! Brian!

35:42.808 --> 35:43.941
Is everything ok?

35:44.009 --> 35:46.344
Yes. I think so.

35:49.581 --> 35:51.949
Where did you get that?

35:54.019 --> 35:57.622
From your shrine
for curtis up the road.

35:59.124 --> 36:01.292
Why did you do this?

36:03.128 --> 36:05.063
I didn't mean
for her to get hurt.

36:05.130 --> 36:06.631
I believe you.

36:06.699 --> 36:07.899
What?

36:07.966 --> 36:11.402
is madison here?

36:11.470 --> 36:13.304
It's gonna be
all right.

36:13.372 --> 36:15.106
Ok.

36:18.010 --> 36:20.912
Madison?

36:22.348 --> 36:23.948
Nobody
is mad at you.

36:24.016 --> 36:26.117
You don't have
to hide.

36:27.619 --> 36:29.454
Sweet...sweetheart?

36:29.521 --> 36:30.922
It's daddy.

36:30.989 --> 36:33.658
We just want
to talk with you.

36:33.726 --> 36:35.793
She's here.

36:37.162 --> 36:39.731
You did this to bring
them together, didn't you?

36:39.798 --> 36:42.400
I didn't. Fate did.

36:42.468 --> 36:44.035
Fate?

36:44.103 --> 36:46.003
You mean your accident?

36:46.071 --> 36:48.806
No, I mean, like,
practically every day since.

36:48.874 --> 36:51.642
I don't understand.

36:51.710 --> 36:54.312
Ever since he started coming
to talk to me on that road,

36:54.380 --> 36:57.749
I noticed
she'd go there, too.

36:57.816 --> 37:00.318
She'd come the anniversary
of the crash,

37:00.386 --> 37:02.320
And he'd come the
anniversary of when I died.

37:02.388 --> 37:04.222
So they missed each other.

37:05.557 --> 37:09.260
But I followed her,
and I started noticing

37:09.328 --> 37:11.929
That she likes all the
same stuff you like, daddy.

37:11.997 --> 37:14.632
And not just weird groups
and mini golf,

37:14.700 --> 37:16.434
But you both hate
snow skiing

37:16.502 --> 37:18.269
And people who take up
2 parking spaces,

37:18.337 --> 37:19.837
And people who say
"supposebly."

37:19.905 --> 37:22.707
She followed you.

37:22.775 --> 37:25.843
You both have a lot in
common, and not just music

37:25.911 --> 37:28.713
And movies
and mini golf.

37:28.781 --> 37:32.216
But you both don't
like snow skiing

37:32.284 --> 37:34.952
And people who take
up 2 parking spaces

37:35.020 --> 37:37.722
And people who use
the word "supposebly."

37:37.790 --> 37:39.724
Supposebly is not a word.

37:39.792 --> 37:42.193
No. And people who take
2 parking spaces...

37:42.261 --> 37:44.028
Should be beaten.

37:45.230 --> 37:47.331
Plus, even the accident,

37:47.399 --> 37:50.067
It only happened
because dad and her fiancé

37:50.135 --> 37:53.504
Happened to be buying tickets
to the same bizarre concert.

37:53.572 --> 37:56.474
The accident was
just a part of it.

37:56.542 --> 37:59.744
You and curtis, you were headed to
buy tickets for the same concert.

37:59.812 --> 38:01.946
Broken social scene.

38:03.215 --> 38:05.216
It's my second
favorite group.

38:09.822 --> 38:11.255
Honey...

38:11.323 --> 38:14.625
Um, having a few things
in common with someone

38:14.693 --> 38:16.794
Doesn't necessarily mean
the two of them

38:16.862 --> 38:19.330
Should end up together.

38:19.398 --> 38:21.399
Madison: I never said
they should end up together.

38:21.467 --> 38:23.534
Just talk.

38:23.602 --> 38:26.437
She just wants you
to talk.

38:28.807 --> 38:30.241
You don't think I talk?

38:30.309 --> 38:32.877
Till today, not hardly.

38:32.945 --> 38:35.012
Not really.

38:35.080 --> 38:37.014
Until today.

38:39.051 --> 38:41.752
Because avery,
she understands.

38:41.820 --> 38:43.788
That's the real thing
you have in common...

38:43.856 --> 38:46.157
Me, her fiancé,

38:46.225 --> 38:48.359
The wreck,
and how that feels.

38:48.427 --> 38:52.730
Is that why you started haunting avery?

38:52.798 --> 38:54.799
Because something reminded
you of the accident?

38:54.867 --> 38:57.768
No. Daddy
was feeling so sad,

38:57.836 --> 38:59.370
Like a new place
would help.

38:59.438 --> 39:01.239
He was going to move.

39:01.306 --> 39:03.808
And you were thinking
about moving?

39:03.876 --> 39:07.278
Yeah. Yeah, she's right.
I mean, I was looking.

39:07.346 --> 39:09.080
You were?
Yeah.

39:09.147 --> 39:11.916
Then they'd lose
their chance.

39:11.984 --> 39:12.917
I couldn't say good-bye

39:12.985 --> 39:14.585
Till I made it
mean something.

39:14.653 --> 39:16.087
What mean something?

39:16.154 --> 39:18.422
Me being gone.

39:21.126 --> 39:22.660
What?

39:22.728 --> 39:25.129
What?

39:25.197 --> 39:28.866
She wanted her death
to mean something.

39:30.903 --> 39:33.971
That's what
all this is for.

39:39.044 --> 39:41.112
Sweetheart?

39:41.179 --> 39:44.515
Oh, god, madison.

39:44.583 --> 39:46.617
No.

39:46.685 --> 39:52.256
Your life meant
so much to me.

39:52.324 --> 39:54.592
It would mean
even more if you try.

39:54.660 --> 39:56.027
Promise, daddy.

39:56.094 --> 39:57.795
Just try.

39:57.863 --> 40:00.731
She needs you to promise
that you're gonna try.

40:03.602 --> 40:06.470
Oh. I...honey,

40:06.538 --> 40:07.705
I don't know.
I can.

40:09.508 --> 40:11.275
I can try.

40:11.343 --> 40:12.643
Really?

40:12.711 --> 40:14.478
I mean, you sure?

40:14.546 --> 40:15.646
Mm-hmm.

40:17.082 --> 40:19.517
Ok. I'll try.

40:22.554 --> 40:23.621
Can you tell him
never to wear

40:23.689 --> 40:24.822
The cologne
that mom gave him?

40:24.890 --> 40:27.992
He thinks it makes him
irresistible. It doesn't.

40:29.461 --> 40:31.429
Yeah,
I'll tell him that.

40:31.496 --> 40:34.198
Sweetheart?

40:34.266 --> 40:35.833
I'm going to miss you...

40:35.901 --> 40:38.836
Every single day of my life.

40:42.641 --> 40:45.176
And I love you so much.

40:57.723 --> 40:59.957
I love you, too.

41:20.579 --> 41:22.413
She's gone.

41:40.532 --> 41:42.800
I mean, does our son
just imagine

41:42.868 --> 41:44.602
That little elves
come out at night

41:44.670 --> 41:46.837
And clean up
his toys for him?

41:46.905 --> 41:48.472
I don't...no.

41:48.540 --> 41:51.742
He probably imagines
that we come out and do it.

41:51.810 --> 41:55.680
I really wish someone
would clean up my toys.

41:55.747 --> 41:58.449
Sorry. I keep
taking these from ned.

41:58.517 --> 42:00.985
What's wrong?

42:01.053 --> 42:03.087
Nobody died.

42:03.155 --> 42:04.989
That's a bad thing?

42:05.057 --> 42:06.557
Well, no, it's just
that the board

42:06.625 --> 42:08.592
Said that somebody was going
to die, and they didn't.

42:08.660 --> 42:11.095
Good.
The board was wrong.

42:11.163 --> 42:13.798
You're right.
The board was wrong.

42:18.103 --> 42:19.470
No.

42:21.939 --> 42:24.341
Does that mean that
somebody is going to die?

42:32.000 --> 42:33.400
Is it someone we know?

42:39.000 --> 42:44.000
