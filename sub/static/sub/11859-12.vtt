WEBVTT

00:10.750 --> 00:14.083
You get done cleaning up
that mess, go tackle the John.

00:14.166 --> 00:15.083
Stopped up again.

00:15.166 --> 00:16.208
I look like a janitor, Tommy?

00:16.291 --> 00:18.333
Haven't taken my lunch yet.

00:18.417 --> 00:20.417
You're spending too much
time on each job, Ed.

00:20.500 --> 00:23.250
You gotta turn around six more
cars after you clean the can.

00:27.500 --> 00:29.917
I'd eat first before
I walked in there, Ed.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.208
Or call FEMA.

00:31.291 --> 00:33.917
Hey, Channel 7.
What's she wearing?

00:34.000 --> 00:35.834
(man on TV)
'Welcome to
Pennsylvania Power Lotto..'

00:35.917 --> 00:37.417
Wearing out your
bank account, buddy.

00:37.500 --> 00:40.250
It's a sucker's dream.

00:40.333 --> 00:42.208
Ed? Can I talk to you?

00:44.375 --> 00:45.959
- Yeah.
- I um..

00:46.041 --> 00:49.625
I just got that
estimate on my
car.

00:49.709 --> 00:51.959
I can't afford this.

00:52.041 --> 00:53.625
[whistles]
Two grand.

00:53.709 --> 00:54.959
Ain't that beautiful.

00:55.041 --> 00:57.166
Tommy ought to be
ashamed of himself.

00:57.250 --> 00:58.500
Yeah, I just got
my tuition bill.

00:58.583 --> 01:00.333
But I need my car to get
from work to school. I--

01:00.417 --> 01:01.667
Relax. Relax.

01:01.750 --> 01:03.917
Most of these repairs
you don't even need.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.125
A-and I got a rebuilt
water pump in the back.

01:06.208 --> 01:08.041
- I just need it to run.
- Uh..

01:08.125 --> 01:10.125
- 'What can you afford?'
- 'Um..'

01:10.208 --> 01:13.792
- Maybe 400.
- Four hundred?

01:13.875 --> 01:15.792
Okay, I'll fix all the stuff
you need to have done

01:15.875 --> 01:17.458
and drop it off
your place tomorrow.

01:17.542 --> 01:18.834
- Don't sweat it, Shelly.
- Thanks, Ed.

01:18.917 --> 01:21.500
- No problem, Shelly.
- You're the best.

01:25.208 --> 01:26.917
Keep cutting folks
a break like that

01:27.000 --> 01:28.083
boss will take it
out
of your hide, Ed.

01:28.166 --> 01:29.500
Yeah, he can kiss it.

01:29.583 --> 01:33.625
- 20, 49..
- Hey, what's it up to?

01:35.083 --> 01:36.709
Huh?

01:36.792 --> 01:38.333
Jackpot.
What's the latest?

01:38.417 --> 01:39.667
I don't know.
Seven, eight mil?

01:42.417 --> 01:45.125
(man on TV)
27..

01:45.208 --> 01:46.667
Break's over, George.

01:46.750 --> 01:50.667
Ed, you just tell that
customer
we padded her bill?

01:50.750 --> 01:53.125
(man on TV)
And 55.

01:53.208 --> 01:55.166
'Thanks for playing
Pennsylvania Power Lotto
today.'

01:55.250 --> 01:56.834
'Benefits to public school..'

01:56.917 --> 01:59.166
I'm talking to you, Ed.

01:59.250 --> 02:01.333
You can stick it where the sun
don't shine, Tommy.

02:01.417 --> 02:03.083
'Cause I quit!

02:08.667 --> 02:11.000
Look at this!

02:18.333 --> 02:19.542
How long you playing
the lotto, Ed?

02:19.625 --> 02:21.041
Well, since my sister, Pam

02:21.125 --> 02:22.792
was old enough
to buy me a
ticket.

02:22.875 --> 02:25.875
Hey, Ed. What are you planning
on doing with the eight
million?

02:25.959 --> 02:28.250
What do you think?
I'm gonna spend it!

03:03.125 --> 03:04.458
Well, Detective Strickland

03:04.542 --> 03:06.458
just caught that double
over in Point Breeze.

03:06.542 --> 03:08.333
I'll call you later.

03:08.417 --> 03:10.125
Look like you could use
a few winks, Walt.

03:10.208 --> 03:11.458
Too many open jobs, Lil.

03:11.542 --> 03:13.250
Hoping you might be able
to take one off my plate.

03:13.333 --> 03:14.917
Heard one might be
thawin' out?

03:15.000 --> 03:17.500
Auto mechanic named Ed Dubinski
got popped in Fishtown

03:17.583 --> 03:19.041
on his way back
from the SwiftMart.

03:19.125 --> 03:20.959
- Way back to where?
- Working late in the garage.

03:21.041 --> 03:22.542
Shooter took his wallet.

03:22.625 --> 03:25.083
- Robbery gone bad.
- What we thought.

03:25.166 --> 03:27.667
(Walt)
'Thing is, Dubinski wasn't
just any grease monkey.'

03:27.750 --> 03:31.542
He won eight million in the
lottery six months before.

03:31.625 --> 03:33.417
- Eight million?
- 'Yeah.'

03:33.500 --> 03:36.792
I asked the bank to keep Ed's
account open in case the doer

03:36.875 --> 03:39.041
'tried to use
the stolen ATM card.'

03:39.125 --> 03:40.333
And how much was
in the account?

03:40.417 --> 03:43.458
- Seven and change.
- Seven mil?

03:43.542 --> 03:45.709
Seven dollars
and thirty nine cents.

03:45.792 --> 03:47.041
Dubinski went
through it all.

03:47.125 --> 03:49.166
- Lost eight million
dollars?
- Yeah.

03:49.250 --> 03:52.083
Turns out a lot of these lottery
winners get in over their heads.

03:52.166 --> 03:54.792
One third of them go
bankrupt in five years.

03:54.875 --> 03:56.083
Ed was no different.

03:56.166 --> 03:57.875
Has something
kicked up on the
case?

03:57.959 --> 03:59.458
Someone used Dubinski's
card yesterday

03:59.542 --> 04:01.166
at a sandwich shop
in Center City.

04:01.250 --> 04:03.667
- ATM camera working?
- 'There wasn't one.'

04:03.750 --> 04:06.959
Uh, doer attempted a
withdrawal,
checked his bank balance.

04:07.041 --> 04:08.208
Means the killer
knew his PIN number.

04:08.291 --> 04:09.792
Someone who knew him?

04:09.875 --> 04:12.542
Or the stickup guy
made him give it up.

04:12.625 --> 04:14.834
But why wait two years
to hit that account?

04:16.875 --> 04:20.083
Unless they think
the jackpot's still out
there.

04:54.083 --> 04:57.166
Ed Dubinski, 34.

04:57.250 --> 04:59.083
Moved back to his old
Fishtown apartment

04:59.166 --> 05:00.375
a few days before
his murder.

05:00.458 --> 05:01.667
Talk about bottoming out.

05:01.750 --> 05:03.542
The guy burned through
eight mil in six
months.

05:03.625 --> 05:05.041
Wait, how's that
even possible?

05:05.125 --> 05:06.208
What was he, smokin' it?

05:06.291 --> 05:08.000
Jackpot's up to
18 mil this
week.

05:08.083 --> 05:10.208
More people in the pool,
more tickets we can buy.

05:10.291 --> 05:12.375
I don't know.
Seems like a chump's game.

05:12.458 --> 05:13.542
Well, this chump's
gonna be rich

05:13.625 --> 05:15.333
when the money train comes in.

05:15.417 --> 05:16.542
You in the lotto pool, Will?

05:16.625 --> 05:19.125
- Nope, it's pointless.
- Wrong.

05:19.208 --> 05:21.542
Point is, dreaming about
the things you'd do if you
won.

05:21.625 --> 05:24.291
Uh, Dubinski went
for a pack of
smokes

05:24.375 --> 05:26.041
at the SwiftMart
around midnight.

05:26.125 --> 05:29.375
Shot in an empty lot on his
way
back to the auto repair shop.

05:29.458 --> 05:31.041
Slug from a nine
recovered from the
body.

05:31.125 --> 05:34.500
Cashier, Shelly Reid,
last to see talking to Rush.

05:34.583 --> 05:36.000
Any surviving next of kin?

05:36.083 --> 05:38.333
Uh, older sister, Pam,
owns a hardware store

05:38.417 --> 05:40.083
in East Falls with
her husband, Marty.

05:40.166 --> 05:42.125
Took custody of
Ed
at age 18.

05:42.208 --> 05:43.500
What happened to the parents?

05:43.583 --> 05:45.625
Lost mom to a car
accident,
dad to prison.

05:45.709 --> 05:47.291
What else we got
on Ed's finances?

05:47.375 --> 05:50.417
Money manager listed here as a
Roger Weaver, on the way in.

05:50.500 --> 05:54.417
PIN number was 7-4-7-5-3-9.

05:54.500 --> 05:57.000
Figure the killer had to
know Ed to get that
number?

05:57.083 --> 05:59.291
What are the odds
of guessing a six-digit PIN?

05:59.375 --> 06:01.000
I'll bet I could guess yours.

06:01.083 --> 06:02.458
Shut up.

06:02.542 --> 06:04.250
Fifty bucks.
Give me your ATM card.

06:04.333 --> 06:05.333
Tell you right now.

06:05.417 --> 06:07.500
It ain't my birthday
or my address.

06:07.583 --> 06:09.750
Machine eats it,
you owe me double.

06:09.834 --> 06:11.041
We'll see.

06:19.208 --> 06:21.333
I work part-time
at the Swiftee.

06:21.417 --> 06:23.333
I'm going to night school
to become a veterinarian.

06:23.417 --> 06:24.959
Tough, though, you know?

06:25.041 --> 06:27.291
- You knew Ed from the store?
- 'He worked up the street.'

06:27.375 --> 06:30.291
Used to come in
for coffee and smokes.

06:30.375 --> 06:31.959
Seemed like a nice guy.

06:32.041 --> 06:33.625
You said that
he fixed your car?

06:33.709 --> 06:35.208
It was always
breaking down.

06:35.291 --> 06:38.250
He knew I was on
a tight budget, so..

06:38.333 --> 06:41.250
...he'd cut me a break and
then I'd give him free
refills.

06:41.333 --> 06:42.792
Ed come in to
use
the ATM a lot?

06:42.875 --> 06:44.959
Sometimes. Just coffee
that night, though.

06:45.041 --> 06:46.625
He'd just moved
back to Fishtown.

06:46.709 --> 06:48.166
Did he seem okay to you

06:48.250 --> 06:49.500
when he left the store?

06:49.583 --> 06:50.750
I think he was
a little embarrassed

06:50.834 --> 06:51.959
about losing all that money.

06:54.417 --> 06:56.667
I can't believe somebody
would shoot him.

06:57.542 --> 06:58.875
Sweet guy, you know?

06:58.959 --> 07:01.834
I can only offer
financial advice,
detective.

07:01.917 --> 07:03.333
Most of my clients take it.

07:03.417 --> 07:05.000
Mr. Dubinski was an exception.

07:05.083 --> 07:06.917
An eight million
dollar exception.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.417
5.2 after taking
the lump sum.

07:09.500 --> 07:11.166
Three million after taxes.

07:11.250 --> 07:14.500
'Another million down on
a house with property tax
due.'

07:14.583 --> 07:18.291
And the rest went to whomever
had their hand out first.

07:18.375 --> 07:20.458
How'd you get hooked up
with Ed, Mr. Weaver?

07:20.542 --> 07:22.500
Well, I get most of my
clients through referral

07:22.583 --> 07:25.000
but Mr. Dubinski found me
in the Yellow Pages.

07:25.083 --> 07:26.542
You draw up a will for him?

07:26.625 --> 07:29.458
Well, I set him up with
an attorney to-to handle
it

07:29.542 --> 07:31.166
'but he was killed before
the scheduled appointment.'

07:31.250 --> 07:32.667
So any money
would've gone to..

07:32.750 --> 07:33.667
His sister

07:33.750 --> 07:35.208
'now stuck with probate.'

07:35.291 --> 07:37.166
But I'd be surprised
if there's enough

07:37.250 --> 07:38.667
to cover his funeral expenses.

07:38.750 --> 07:41.166
We'll need to take a look at
all of his financial records.

07:41.250 --> 07:44.208
Look, detective, I
regret
I couldn't help him

07:44.291 --> 07:45.542
more than I did.

07:45.625 --> 07:48.709
But a fool and his
money
are easily parted.

07:52.458 --> 07:54.709
(Pam)
'My little brother
practically
grew up in this store.'

07:54.792 --> 07:56.917
Yeah, always
tinkering
with something.

07:57.000 --> 08:00.125
Marty taught him
how to fix things.

08:00.208 --> 08:02.792
How he got so good with cars.

08:02.875 --> 08:04.625
Anyone you know
had a problem with
Ed?

08:04.709 --> 08:06.709
No.
Everybody loved
him.

08:06.792 --> 08:09.875
He was like a-a big kid.

08:09.959 --> 08:12.208
If anything killed Ed,
it was that damn
lottery.

08:12.291 --> 08:13.709
The lottery killed Ed?

08:13.792 --> 08:17.333
We never had any money
when we were growing up.

08:17.417 --> 08:19.375
It was all just too much.

08:19.458 --> 08:21.250
His face gets on TV,
and all of a sudden

08:21.333 --> 08:22.792
he's surrounded
by a bunch of phonies

08:22.875 --> 08:23.834
takin' advantage of him.

08:23.917 --> 08:25.083
Any in particular
you remember?

08:25.166 --> 08:26.375
(Pam)
'I didn't know any of them.'

08:26.458 --> 08:27.875
Too many freeloaders
to count.

08:27.959 --> 08:30.291
Hard to believe how fast
he burned through all that
cash.

08:30.375 --> 08:32.750
(Marty)
'We tried to get him to do
something constructive with
it.'

08:32.834 --> 08:35.458
But it was like, like the
money
wasn't real to him.

08:35.542 --> 08:39.250
Cleaned out his apartment,
there was nothing but bills.

08:39.333 --> 08:41.333
And this probate thing
is still a mess.

08:41.417 --> 08:43.417
I'd like to get copies
of Ed's probate papers.

08:43.500 --> 08:45.125
- If that's okay.
- However I can help.

08:45.208 --> 08:46.834
Is Ed the kind of guy
that'd give out his

08:46.917 --> 08:48.417
ATM card or PIN number?

08:48.500 --> 08:52.083
Maybe. Ed trusted everybody.
Generous to a fault.

08:52.166 --> 08:55.083
Problem was, he just..

08:55.166 --> 08:56.417
...couldn't say no.

09:17.959 --> 09:19.166
Hey!

09:19.250 --> 09:21.792
Hey, hey, you guys
check out the bathrooms?

09:21.875 --> 09:23.792
All-black porcelain
and gold fixtures.

09:23.875 --> 09:25.500
Plasma TV's in every one.

09:25.583 --> 09:26.750
Huh?

09:26.834 --> 09:28.792
Oh, it's, uh,
it's really something,
Ed.

09:28.875 --> 09:30.917
Are those, uh, pinball
machines over there?

09:31.000 --> 09:32.166
Yeah!

09:32.250 --> 09:33.959
I used to get up
everyday to fix cars

09:34.041 --> 09:36.041
now I just play
pinball all day.

09:36.125 --> 09:37.875
Hey, Pammy, you remember
when we were kids

09:37.959 --> 09:39.333
when we went to Atlantic City?

09:39.417 --> 09:41.583
And then...we just
like played, all day.

09:41.667 --> 09:43.750
Of course I remember, Ed.
Yeah.

09:44.875 --> 09:45.959
Do you know
all these people?

09:46.041 --> 09:47.333
Sure, they're
all
my friends.

09:47.417 --> 09:48.792
Hope you're not spending
too much money.

09:48.875 --> 09:50.125
Oh, hey,
that reminds me. I got..

09:50.208 --> 09:52.333
I got something
special for you guys.

09:56.041 --> 09:57.750
'No, open it.
Open it.'

09:59.333 --> 10:02.000
Oh!
The Atlantic City boardwalk.

10:04.291 --> 10:05.834
It's 50,000!

10:05.917 --> 10:08.875
- Wow!
- I owe you, Pam.

10:08.959 --> 10:10.667
Ed, you know you don't
owe me a thing.

10:13.083 --> 10:14.667
Thanks.

10:14.750 --> 10:17.750
- You're the best, bud.
- Thanks.

10:17.834 --> 10:21.667
If you guys need anything
else
you just let me know, okay.

10:21.750 --> 10:23.709

10:23.792 --> 10:25.542
'Your presence is requested
outside on the double.'

10:25.625 --> 10:26.917
Oh, dude.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.625
Sounds like my ride got here.
Hey, come on.

10:29.709 --> 10:31.166
'Come on!'

10:33.125 --> 10:34.500
Whoa!

10:34.583 --> 10:37.291
Yeah! Ha-ha!

10:37.375 --> 10:38.709
Wow!

10:38.792 --> 10:40.000
Oh!

10:41.625 --> 10:43.417
Oh, hello, pretty car.

10:43.500 --> 10:44.542
'This is awesome!'

10:44.625 --> 10:46.208
How much this
car cost, Ed?

10:46.291 --> 10:48.792
Who cares?
Look at it!

10:48.875 --> 10:50.709
[tires screeching]
Oh!

10:54.583 --> 10:55.875
[laughing]
Yeah!

11:00.834 --> 11:04.250
Old Georgie wasn't laughing
too
hard when his buzz wore off.

11:04.333 --> 11:05.500
George Sweeney,
from the garage?

11:05.583 --> 11:07.125
Yeah, the two of them were..

11:07.208 --> 11:10.458
...like kids in a candy
store.
Used to be good friends.

11:10.542 --> 11:12.875
Sounds like he handed
out a lot of checks.

11:12.959 --> 11:16.250
Well, we didn't need
it.
But we put it to good
use.

11:16.333 --> 11:19.333
Something I wish
that
Ed would have done.

11:19.417 --> 11:20.750
(Jeffries)
'Now, George Sweeney filed'

11:20.834 --> 11:22.542
a two million-dollar
lawsuit against Ed.

11:22.625 --> 11:26.083
Hired that ambulance chaser
with those late-night TV ads.

11:26.166 --> 11:27.375
The "King of Compensation."

11:27.458 --> 11:29.125
Any record of a trial
or a settlement?

11:29.208 --> 11:30.750
Ah, looks like
it was
dismissed.

11:30.834 --> 11:33.417
George still works at
the auto shop in
Fishtown.

11:33.500 --> 11:34.917
Near where Ed
was killed.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.542
Yeah, maybe old George
figured out Ed's PIN number.

11:37.625 --> 11:39.500
'Thought he was still
due a nice settlement.'

11:39.583 --> 11:40.709
What you got?

11:40.792 --> 11:41.959
Figure out how
the code's personal.

11:42.041 --> 11:43.417
'We figure how
the shooter got it.'

11:43.500 --> 11:45.083
- Run Ed's personal info?
- Mm-hmm.

11:45.166 --> 11:47.250
Old phone numbers, addresses,
friends' birthdays

11:47.333 --> 11:49.709
social numbers, you name
it.
Nothin' yet.

11:49.792 --> 11:51.959
We get any paperwork
from the money manager?

11:52.041 --> 11:53.291
Eight million
dollars of it.

11:53.375 --> 11:56.041
Saw the latest jackpot
just went up to 33 million.

11:56.125 --> 11:57.709
Nick sucked you in
on that pool?

11:57.792 --> 12:01.709
Hmm, well, 33 will pay for
a lot of old Blue Note
vinyl.

12:02.500 --> 12:05.208
How about you, boss?

12:05.291 --> 12:07.375
Got a better chance
of winning "American Idol."

12:12.875 --> 12:14.000
First try, sucker.

12:14.083 --> 12:17.625
Knew it had to be
either Flyers or boobies.

12:17.709 --> 12:19.542
Hi.

12:19.625 --> 12:21.959
- That's gonna leave a mark.
- 'A little jumpy, George?'

12:22.041 --> 12:23.709
Or you just naturally clumsy?

12:23.792 --> 12:25.542
- What's this all about,
guys?
- Ed Dubinski.

12:25.625 --> 12:27.041
You took a dive
on his property.

12:27.125 --> 12:28.875
- Ed was my friend.
- Is that why you sued him?

12:28.959 --> 12:30.417
I had a lot of medical bills.

12:30.500 --> 12:33.000
I-I-I just needed
Ed's insurance to pay up.

12:33.083 --> 12:35.667
- It wasn't personal.
- Oh, sure it was.

12:35.750 --> 12:37.583
You go back to rebuild
transmissions.

12:37.667 --> 12:39.000
He goes off
to spend his millions.

12:39.083 --> 12:41.208
No, I was, I
was happy for
Ed.

12:41.291 --> 12:44.250
Look, I-I was his friend
before he won that money

12:44.333 --> 12:46.041
and I was still his friend
after he lost it.

12:46.125 --> 12:48.166
How did you know
he lost it all,
George?

12:48.250 --> 12:49.875
Why else would you move
back to Fishtown?

12:49.959 --> 12:52.000
- You own a gun, George?
- No, no, no.

12:52.083 --> 12:53.667
I never asked Ed
for a thing.

12:53.750 --> 12:56.625
But, I mean, you win a lotto
like that, you never know

12:56.709 --> 12:59.333
who's gonna come crawling
out of the woodwork.

13:17.583 --> 13:19.542
To the good life.

13:21.750 --> 13:23.667
Listen, Ed..

13:23.750 --> 13:26.041
I feel real bad about that
shark lawyer bugging you.

13:26.125 --> 13:27.834
Yeah, I got to say I
was kind of surprised

13:27.917 --> 13:29.125
you didn't talk
to me first.

13:29.208 --> 13:30.917
- I mean, we go way back,
right?
- I know.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.834
I had no idea that
he was gonna sue you.

13:32.917 --> 13:34.542
Yeah.

13:34.625 --> 13:37.208
I talked to my,
uh, insurance people.

13:37.291 --> 13:41.291
They said that ATV accidents
aren't covered under my
policy.

13:41.375 --> 13:43.625
So..

13:43.709 --> 13:45.709
Here.

13:48.458 --> 13:49.750
Twenty five G's?

13:49.834 --> 13:52.583
That's a lot of money,
Ed.
I can't take this.

13:52.667 --> 13:53.875
George, we're like family, man.

13:53.959 --> 13:55.083
I don't want this
to come between us.

13:55.166 --> 13:56.291
Just-just take it.

13:57.834 --> 13:59.875
Thanks.
Tsk. Thanks.

14:01.542 --> 14:03.375
Oh, I best be goin'.

14:03.458 --> 14:05.375
Some of us got to
go back to work.

14:05.458 --> 14:06.667
What, Tommy threatened
to fire you?

14:06.750 --> 14:08.500
Told me I got to do
three clutches
tomorrow.

14:08.583 --> 14:11.917
Hey, make sure you
resurface the flywheel.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.750
Armchair mechanic.

14:13.834 --> 14:15.375
What can I say?
I get bored.

14:16.834 --> 14:19.125
Alright.

14:19.208 --> 14:20.417
First one with a head shot

14:20.500 --> 14:22.000
doesn't have to make
a run for beer.

14:23.959 --> 14:25.083
Oh!

14:33.750 --> 14:35.291
This is when
the real guns came out.

14:35.375 --> 14:38.125
You know, I knew that it was
time to get back to reality.

14:38.208 --> 14:39.625
The hell was this
crazy old codger?

14:39.709 --> 14:41.792
- Ed said it was his father.
- His father?

14:41.875 --> 14:43.375
- Thought he was long gone.
- Yeah.

14:43.458 --> 14:45.458
He must've heard about
Ed hitting the big money.

14:45.542 --> 14:47.000
Came to pick up a payday.

14:47.083 --> 14:49.291
And it looked like he
came back to have a catch.

14:56.208 --> 14:57.291
Hey!

14:57.375 --> 14:59.542
'Jack Dubinski,
Philly PD. Open up.'

15:03.792 --> 15:05.583
I'm entertainin' a
friend.
Do you mind?

15:05.667 --> 15:06.625
Not at all.

15:06.709 --> 15:08.875
Open up, Jack.

15:08.959 --> 15:11.000
Come back when
you got a warrant.

15:11.083 --> 15:12.709
Gun.

15:12.792 --> 15:15.166
[groaning]
What did you do that for?

15:15.250 --> 15:16.667
No, you don't.

15:16.750 --> 15:19.667
- Welcome back to Philly, Jack.
- Watch the back! Not my back!

15:19.750 --> 15:22.166
(Miller)
'That gun's gonna land
you back in prison.'

15:22.250 --> 15:23.917
How long depends
on what you tell us.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.875
What did I do now?

15:25.959 --> 15:27.750
For starters,
you're here..

15:27.834 --> 15:29.500
...in the same town
your son got capped.

15:29.583 --> 15:31.333
Yeah?
The world's a rough place.

15:31.417 --> 15:32.542
I don't recall
your daughter telling us

15:32.625 --> 15:33.834
you were at his funeral.

15:33.917 --> 15:35.834
I got no relationship
with my daughter.

15:35.917 --> 15:38.333
No, you just came out of your
rat hole to shake Ed down.

15:38.417 --> 15:39.667
A month later,
your boy's dead.

15:39.750 --> 15:40.875
Just 'cause
I'm a crappy
dad

15:40.959 --> 15:42.417
don't mean I'd
hurt
my own blood.

15:42.500 --> 15:44.834
Ed's old bank card got
used a couple days ago.

15:44.917 --> 15:46.709
We turn this place upside
down,
we gonna find it?

15:46.792 --> 15:47.875
Don't know what you're
talking about.

15:47.959 --> 15:49.709
Why did you go see Ed, Jack?

15:49.792 --> 15:52.000
It wasn't a shakedown.
I just..

15:52.083 --> 15:55.166
...needed a little help,
get back on my feet.

15:58.375 --> 16:00.709
Some place you got here, Ed.

16:00.792 --> 16:01.959
Thanks.

16:02.041 --> 16:03.291
We like it.

16:03.375 --> 16:05.166
Want a drink?
We got a bar.

16:05.250 --> 16:06.458
Uh, beer is fine.

16:06.542 --> 16:08.667
Hey, can we get
two beers, baby?

16:10.125 --> 16:12.208
You remember Nikki?

16:15.667 --> 16:17.208
Engaged, huh?

16:17.291 --> 16:18.625
Congratulations.

16:20.125 --> 16:21.458
Thanks.

16:29.458 --> 16:33.542
- Keep an eye on her.
- What do you mean?

16:33.625 --> 16:34.792
One thing I know about women

16:34.875 --> 16:37.125
who've got one hand
on your wallet

16:37.208 --> 16:39.500
and one foot out the door.

16:39.583 --> 16:41.417
No risk, no reward, right?

16:42.625 --> 16:44.417
I must have got
that from you.

16:44.500 --> 16:46.500
Why I kept playing
numbers all these
years?

16:46.583 --> 16:49.291
Blew through my share
of cash, too.

16:49.375 --> 16:53.000
Wished I'd put some aside,
looked out more for you.

16:53.083 --> 16:54.583
Pam took care of me.

16:54.667 --> 16:55.667
And Marty.

16:55.750 --> 16:57.375
How is your sister?

16:57.458 --> 16:59.709
She'd be
surprised
to see you.

16:59.792 --> 17:01.083
- Yeah.
- I know I was.

17:01.166 --> 17:03.166
I'm sorry I wasn't there
for you, kid.

17:03.250 --> 17:06.333
'But we have plenty of time
to catch up now, don't we?'

17:06.417 --> 17:09.417
Sure.
Yeah, I'd like
that.

17:09.500 --> 17:10.667
Alright.

17:10.750 --> 17:12.583
Hey, I got something
for you.

17:17.750 --> 17:20.709
It's a...it's a French circus
Nikki's been wanting to see.

17:20.792 --> 17:23.542
We're, uh, driving
over
to Atlantic City
tonight.

17:23.625 --> 17:26.083
- 'Hoping you could join us.'
- Yup. It sounds like fun.

17:26.166 --> 17:28.041
Yeah, I thought, like,
afterwards we could go

17:28.125 --> 17:30.000
to the boardwalk, like when
Pam and me were kids.

17:30.083 --> 17:31.375
'And then we could
go play pinball'

17:31.458 --> 17:32.709
'and go over to
that museum, you know'

17:32.792 --> 17:34.792
the one with the...
with the mermaid in it.

17:34.875 --> 17:36.291
Yeah, sure, Ed, listen..

17:36.375 --> 17:38.125
...uh, about that thing.

17:38.208 --> 17:39.583
What, dad?

17:39.667 --> 17:41.166
We-we talked
about it before.

17:56.542 --> 17:58.125
Thanks, son.

17:58.208 --> 18:00.125
Don't worry,
I-I promise to pay you back.

18:04.208 --> 18:06.083
Ed didn't like what I said
about his lady

18:06.166 --> 18:07.834
but he sort of knew
I was right.

18:07.917 --> 18:09.750
So, where were you
the night Ed got shot?

18:09.834 --> 18:13.250
St. Joe's hospital,
getting prepped for surgery.

18:13.333 --> 18:14.583
Surgery?

18:14.667 --> 18:17.667
Fused vertebrae
so I can work again.

18:17.750 --> 18:18.959
Ed's money saved my life.

18:19.041 --> 18:21.333
Finally...be able
to hold down a job.

18:21.417 --> 18:24.375
Another Hallmark moment
in the Dubinski clan.

18:24.458 --> 18:25.750
Yeah, we talked about..

18:25.834 --> 18:28.667
...keeping in touch,
but it just wasn't gonna
happen.

18:28.750 --> 18:30.792
Maybe you could
call your
daughter

18:30.875 --> 18:32.166
see if she'll
bail you out.

18:34.250 --> 18:35.458
Upsy-daisy.

18:37.500 --> 18:39.625
Pipkey, Piskey,
Pisley, Perkey..

18:42.834 --> 18:44.166
"Riskey," with an E.

18:44.250 --> 18:45.542
- Uh-uh.
- 'Why?'

18:45.625 --> 18:47.208
Guy's a mechanic,
not a spelling bee champ.

18:47.291 --> 18:48.875
Put it in.

18:50.125 --> 18:51.834
Satisfied?

18:51.917 --> 18:53.709
Not until I get
everybody in the pool.

18:55.250 --> 18:57.667
Know what
the jackpot's worth?

18:57.750 --> 18:58.875
Enough to get me
a down payment

18:58.959 --> 19:00.583
on a Main Line mansion.

19:00.667 --> 19:03.041
Walk-in closet

19:03.125 --> 19:05.875
full of high-heel shoes.

19:05.959 --> 19:08.333
More tickets we get,
the better our
chances.

19:11.208 --> 19:13.583
Mama could use
a new pair of
shoes.

19:13.667 --> 19:14.792
Mm-hmm.

19:16.291 --> 19:17.917
(Rush)
'Uh, going through
the probate papers'

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
I found this, a Nikki
Dubinski
opened a credit card

19:21.083 --> 19:23.208
using Ed's name and social.

19:23.291 --> 19:24.542
A week before he died.

19:24.625 --> 19:26.542
Ed's fiancée.
They ever married?

19:26.625 --> 19:27.875
Well, looks like
she was enjoying

19:28.000 --> 19:29.792
an extended stay
at the Four Seasons..

19:29.875 --> 19:32.166
...when he found out
about the card.

19:32.250 --> 19:35.834
Froze the account, and she was
arrested for credit card fraud.

19:35.917 --> 19:37.834
Nikki Dubinski.

19:37.917 --> 19:39.417
Nicole Atkins.

19:39.500 --> 19:41.500
Nikki von Haven.
That's quite a
sheet .

19:41.583 --> 19:43.625
Fraud charges were dropped
after Ed's murder.

19:43.709 --> 19:45.667
Lucky lady.
Know where she is?

19:45.750 --> 19:47.917
I faxed her photo to a few
of the high-end hotels..

19:48.000 --> 19:50.375
...and just got a call back
from the Hardtmore.

19:50.458 --> 19:53.083
The concierge recognized her
as one of the ladies

19:53.166 --> 19:55.458
on the four-star
lounge bar circuit.

19:55.542 --> 19:59.291
Oh...happy hunting
for her next
millionaire.

20:03.834 --> 20:05.709
Macallan 18, neat.

20:12.333 --> 20:14.875
Old school scotch man.
I like that.

20:14.959 --> 20:16.125
Nicole Gillette.

20:16.208 --> 20:18.709
- Pleased to meet you.
- John Stillman.

20:18.792 --> 20:20.542
The pleasure is mine.

20:20.625 --> 20:24.000
I'm thinking finance
or pharmaceuticals.

20:24.083 --> 20:25.709
- Close?
- Not quite.

20:29.083 --> 20:30.792
Try not to make
a scene, Nikki.

20:30.875 --> 20:32.291
Hate to snatch you
up out of here

20:32.375 --> 20:35.041
in front of all these
nice, rich people.

20:38.375 --> 20:40.083
Ooh. Oh, my..

20:41.333 --> 20:42.959
I see three
different names,
Nikki.

20:43.041 --> 20:44.291
What's the matter, fellas?

20:44.375 --> 20:46.375
Slow night in Killadelphia?

20:46.458 --> 20:49.166
- Ed Dubinski, your late
fiance.
- I'm aware.

20:49.250 --> 20:51.542
Someone used his ATM card
lookin' for money.

20:51.625 --> 20:54.375
A little pillow talk,
figured you knew his
PIN.

20:54.458 --> 20:58.166
I don't know anything
about that or Ed's murder.

20:58.250 --> 20:59.709
I look like a killer?

20:59.792 --> 21:03.333
Takes all kinds
even pretty ones.

21:03.417 --> 21:05.125
Look, Ed knew the deal.

21:05.208 --> 21:06.542
He enjoyed my company

21:06.625 --> 21:09.083
but we both knew it
wasn't built to last.

21:11.291 --> 21:12.834
Two guys out front
just repoed

21:12.917 --> 21:14.875
your little race car, Ed.

21:14.959 --> 21:16.000
Really?

21:16.083 --> 21:17.125
What, you don't care?

21:17.208 --> 21:19.625
You got checks
bouncing all over town.

21:19.709 --> 21:21.500
Hell, the pool boy
even quit.

21:21.583 --> 21:23.875
Is that before or
after
you slept with him?

21:23.959 --> 21:25.625
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

21:25.709 --> 21:28.125
I know how
this works,
Nikki.

21:28.208 --> 21:30.291
It's been a good ride,
but it's time for me to get
off.

21:30.375 --> 21:32.125
No, it's time for you
to get off your duff, Ed.

21:32.208 --> 21:35.291
Get it together and
figure out what you want.

21:35.375 --> 21:38.208
You know what?
You're right.

21:38.291 --> 21:41.041
- I want you to keep the
ring.
- So, that's it?

21:41.125 --> 21:42.834
It's time for me
to get my house in order.

21:42.917 --> 21:45.375
Well, I'd start by paying
your property tax bill.

21:45.458 --> 21:47.125
It's three months late.

21:47.208 --> 21:49.750
I don't know which
was worse, Nikki

21:49.834 --> 21:51.709
winning the lotto
or meetin' you.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.709
That was the beginning
of the end for Ed.

21:56.792 --> 21:59.333
Went into a tailspin when he
couldn't buy his daddy's
love.

21:59.417 --> 22:00.750
Evidently yours, neither.

22:00.834 --> 22:03.166
What happened to the rest
of Ed's money?

22:03.250 --> 22:05.583
He was all but broke by the
time
he moved back to Fishtown

22:05.667 --> 22:07.041
with his tail
between his legs.

22:07.125 --> 22:08.792
Where were you the
night
Ed was shot?

22:08.875 --> 22:11.667
With a lawyer
from Chestnut Hill.

22:11.750 --> 22:14.208
I'd call him at work.

22:14.291 --> 22:16.208
His wife's a real
bitch on wheels.

22:18.542 --> 22:20.667
Found some big gaps
in Weaver's paperwork.

22:20.750 --> 22:22.041
Yeah? How so?

22:22.125 --> 22:24.166
For one thing, he charged him
20 percent off the top.

22:24.250 --> 22:25.583
Twenty percent?

22:25.667 --> 22:27.083
He should just hit
the guy over the
head.

22:27.166 --> 22:29.250
Hmm. And Weaver only
put the minimum down

22:29.333 --> 22:31.625
on all of Ed's hard assets,
his house, his car.

22:31.709 --> 22:33.917
- To put the cash into bonds?
- Or so he said.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.500
But it looks like
he was moving money

22:35.583 --> 22:36.709
in and out
of his accounts.

22:36.792 --> 22:38.250
Using Ed's money
as a float.

22:38.333 --> 22:40.083
Hmm. Maybe to shore up
other clients' accounts?

22:40.166 --> 22:41.750
Robbing Peter
to pay Paul.

22:41.834 --> 22:43.083
I checked with
the Board of Standards

22:43.166 --> 22:45.000
for certified
financial planners.

22:45.083 --> 22:47.291
Ed filed a formal
grievance against Weaver

22:47.375 --> 22:48.625
just before his murder.

22:48.709 --> 22:50.709
Could have taken away
Weaver's license.

22:50.792 --> 22:52.208
AV unit found
something
else.

22:52.291 --> 22:53.542
Check it out.

22:54.959 --> 22:57.834
Also found him with three
other Powerball winners.

22:57.917 --> 23:00.458
(Miller)
'Lottery millionaires
were his racket.'

23:00.542 --> 23:01.792
Johnny on the spot.

23:01.875 --> 23:04.041
Makes you wonder how
he keeps getting there first.

23:06.041 --> 23:07.291
You know what I'd get?

23:07.375 --> 23:09.375
A new Bugatti.

23:09.458 --> 23:12.208
It's mad torque,
over 600 ponies.

23:12.291 --> 23:13.542
Only built 300 of them.

23:13.625 --> 23:14.959
Well, you ain't
getting Bugatti

23:15.041 --> 23:17.625
'cause you didn't
pony up for the
pool.

23:17.709 --> 23:19.625
What? What?
It's not too late, is it?

23:19.709 --> 23:21.959
Sorry, pal.
Next time.

23:22.041 --> 23:23.125
Oh, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

23:23.208 --> 23:25.792
Hey, hey, hey,
here, come on.

23:25.875 --> 23:26.834
Well..

23:28.792 --> 23:29.792
Nice.

23:29.875 --> 23:31.250
(Vera)
'Whoa.'

23:31.333 --> 23:32.792
What the hell?

23:34.625 --> 23:35.792
Look at this.

23:37.333 --> 23:39.417
Are you serious?

23:39.500 --> 23:41.500
Punk-ass bitch!

23:43.000 --> 23:43.959
Punk-ass bitch?

23:44.041 --> 23:45.917
You do this to my car, pal?

23:46.000 --> 23:47.750
Huh? You the guy
that been calling me?

23:47.834 --> 23:49.375
Oh, man,
you guys are cops?

23:49.458 --> 23:51.000
Yeah, you got two seconds
before you catch

23:51.083 --> 23:52.250
the beating
of your life, moron.

23:52.333 --> 23:53.458
What is your problem, man?

23:53.542 --> 23:55.667
My problem?
He slept with my
wife.

23:55.750 --> 23:57.500
- What?
- Who's your wife?

23:57.583 --> 24:00.083
Frankie.
She's my wife.

24:11.625 --> 24:13.041
(Stillman)
'Quite a racket
you got going, Roger.'

24:13.125 --> 24:14.709
We found the lottery
official who had been

24:14.792 --> 24:16.667
feeding you names and addresses
of the latest winners.

24:16.750 --> 24:18.291
Gerald Malone.

24:18.375 --> 24:19.291
Just lost his job.

24:19.375 --> 24:20.917
But he is willing to testify

24:21.000 --> 24:22.875
that you paid him
for the referrals.

24:22.959 --> 24:24.125
I don't believe this.

24:24.208 --> 24:25.500
Working stiff like Ed
never had a chance

24:25.583 --> 24:26.709
with your paws
on his money.

24:26.792 --> 24:28.667
I have been a certified
financial planner

24:28.750 --> 24:30.125
for over 15 years.

24:30.208 --> 24:31.875
Certified scam artist.

24:31.959 --> 24:33.917
Securing bad loans,
making a mess of his money.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.208
But no bailout for Ed.

24:36.291 --> 24:37.959
He had to file a grievance
with the board.

24:38.041 --> 24:39.250
You would have lost
your license.

24:39.333 --> 24:40.709
He was gonna
have you prosecuted.

24:40.792 --> 24:42.709
But a guy like you would
never let that happen.

24:42.792 --> 24:44.458
What's, what's going on?

24:44.542 --> 24:47.083
You think that I had
something
to do with Ed's murder?

24:47.166 --> 24:48.959
I'm sure the DA
would find your attempt

24:49.041 --> 24:52.041
to cover up fraud and larceny
pretty compelling motive,
Roger.

24:52.125 --> 24:54.250
This is ridiculous.
I didn't kill Ed.

24:54.333 --> 24:55.792
He almost killed me.

24:55.875 --> 24:58.667
You got to take
the long view, Ed.

24:58.750 --> 25:01.041
Now, the market,
it took an unexpected turn.

25:01.125 --> 25:03.250
'And your investments
are down for the moment.'

25:03.333 --> 25:05.000
'They're gonna rebound
at some juncture.'

25:05.083 --> 25:06.250
- How long?
- Hard to say.

25:06.333 --> 25:07.542
Five, maybe ten years.

25:07.625 --> 25:09.500
But-but I, I still got
some money, right?

25:09.583 --> 25:12.250
Well, cash flow's
a little light right
now.

25:12.333 --> 25:13.917
No more toys for a while.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.667
Uh, my house,
my car--

25:15.750 --> 25:17.500
Well, the good news is
that we can use the
equity

25:17.583 --> 25:20.166
left in your house to
pay
off the rest of your
debts.

25:20.250 --> 25:23.667
And, thanks to me, you
still
have your old apartment.

25:23.750 --> 25:25.041
- Thanks to you?
- Yeah.

25:25.125 --> 25:26.375
I held the lease termination

25:26.458 --> 25:28.583
just in case you needed
someplace to go back to.

25:28.667 --> 25:30.333
Now, most people
aren't as lucky.

25:30.417 --> 25:32.333
Lucky?
You call this lucky?

25:32.417 --> 25:34.000
Back to square one is
what it's looking like.

25:34.083 --> 25:36.208
Oh, come on, Ed.
That's a cynical way of--

25:36.291 --> 25:37.667
Shut up!

25:39.500 --> 25:42.250
I just, uh..
I want to know..

25:42.333 --> 25:43.625
I want to know
how much money I have

25:43.709 --> 25:45.458
in the bank right now,
this very second.

25:45.542 --> 25:47.625
Around $100,000,
but I wouldn't recommend

25:47.709 --> 25:48.959
'touching that money
right now, Ed.'

25:49.041 --> 25:51.166
I'm gonna fix this.
Come on, let's go. Now.

25:51.250 --> 25:53.834
'What? Where?'

25:53.917 --> 25:55.542
You're going downstairs
with me

25:55.625 --> 25:57.709
to the bank
so I can get my money.

26:00.000 --> 26:01.667
A 100 grand in cash?

26:01.750 --> 26:02.959
He put it in
the
briefcase.

26:03.041 --> 26:04.834
Just walked right
out of the bank.

26:04.917 --> 26:07.458
Couple days later,
I heard he was
shot.

26:07.542 --> 26:08.875
Where were you
that night?

26:08.959 --> 26:11.125
I had to meet a new
client,
Suzanne McGee.

26:11.208 --> 26:13.333
- Hmm.
- Lottery winner from
Allentown.

26:13.417 --> 26:16.667
Curious. Do you even...
feel anything

26:16.750 --> 26:18.000
after hosing
a guy like that?

26:18.083 --> 26:20.959
Let's be honest, detective.

26:21.041 --> 26:23.375
Wasn't like he earned it.

26:28.083 --> 26:29.542
Called the
IRS
and the SEC.

26:29.625 --> 26:31.375
They'd like to
have
a little talk
with you

26:31.458 --> 26:33.250
about all the money
you earned, Roger.

26:38.417 --> 26:40.542
Hey.

26:40.625 --> 26:43.875
Met a guy last
night,
says he knows you.

26:43.959 --> 26:45.333
Hmm.
Guy who knows me?

26:45.417 --> 26:48.291
Yeah.
Your husband,
Billy.

26:50.750 --> 26:51.834
You're kidding me.

26:51.917 --> 26:53.583
Wish I was.

26:54.625 --> 26:55.792
We're separated.

26:55.875 --> 26:57.166
We have been
for a while.

26:57.250 --> 26:58.500
Does he know that?

27:00.083 --> 27:01.542
What happened?

27:03.375 --> 27:05.250
He jumped me outside
of Jones, Frankie.

27:05.333 --> 27:07.166
Oh, my God,
I'm so
sorry.

27:07.250 --> 27:09.500
But you're okay?
Did you hurt him?

27:11.250 --> 27:12.875
When were you planning
on telling me about this?

27:12.959 --> 27:15.000
I mean, that's why you're
staying at the hotel, ain't
it?

27:15.083 --> 27:16.875
- Look, it's over.
- Yeah.

27:16.959 --> 27:20.291
We're just
working
some stuff out.

27:20.375 --> 27:22.875
Oh, this isn't gonna
be a problem, is it?

27:22.959 --> 27:24.917
I'm thinking, yeah.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.792
So, so, we're
off
for tonight?

27:32.291 --> 27:34.959
No, Detective Jeffries
is not here.

27:35.041 --> 27:37.417
What time's the kid
getting arraigned?

27:37.500 --> 27:38.959
Valentine?

27:39.041 --> 27:41.792
Got it.
I'll make sure he gets
it.

27:43.792 --> 27:45.041
Money goes
to the schools, right?

27:45.125 --> 27:46.375
Sure, boss.

27:46.458 --> 27:48.333
Could also buy
a hell of a
boat.

27:49.875 --> 27:50.959
Aloha.

27:52.333 --> 27:53.750
Where are we
on Ed's missing cash?

27:53.834 --> 27:56.625
Well, checked all bank
accounts,
safety deposit boxes.

27:56.709 --> 27:58.875
Even Ed's old locker
at the auto garage.

27:58.959 --> 28:00.750
No
briefcase,
no money.

28:00.834 --> 28:02.333
Just got off the
phone
with his landlord.

28:02.417 --> 28:03.959
Said a woman was
rooting around Ed's

28:04.041 --> 28:05.834
storage unit in
the parking garage

28:05.917 --> 28:06.917
the day of the shooting.

28:07.000 --> 28:08.458
You get a description?

28:08.542 --> 28:10.625
Medium height, brown hair,
mid-twenties.

28:10.709 --> 28:12.583
Wearing a SwiftMart uniform.

28:14.291 --> 28:15.875
Thought you just knew Ed
from the store, Shelly.

28:15.959 --> 28:17.542
Uh, well, yeah.

28:17.625 --> 28:19.458
I mean, he used to
come in there all the time.

28:19.542 --> 28:21.458
So what were you doing
in his place

28:21.542 --> 28:23.375
rummaging around
his storage unit?

28:23.458 --> 28:24.792
What?

28:24.875 --> 28:26.333
I wasn't rummaging.

28:26.417 --> 28:27.417
What were you looking for?

28:27.500 --> 28:29.750
I was just..
Nothing.

28:29.834 --> 28:31.625
I was returning his bike.
He let me borrow it.

28:31.709 --> 28:33.125
- His bike?
- 'Yeah.'

28:33.208 --> 28:34.959
He lent it to me
'cause my car broke down.

28:35.041 --> 28:36.875
He gave me the key
to his storage unit.

28:36.959 --> 28:38.625
- When was this?
- The day before.

28:38.709 --> 28:40.667
I had no way to get
to class after work.

28:40.750 --> 28:42.125
Really?

28:43.709 --> 28:45.166
He lend you his
bank card, too?

28:45.250 --> 28:46.500
What? No.

28:46.583 --> 28:48.000
I dropped my car off
at the shop

28:48.083 --> 28:51.625
and George told me
that Ed had just moved back.

28:51.709 --> 28:52.959
I heard what happened to him

28:53.041 --> 28:55.125
so I stopped by
to cheer him up.

28:58.291 --> 29:00.458
- Shelly.
- Can I come in?

29:00.542 --> 29:03.291
Oh, yeah.
Uh, come on in. Sorry.

29:03.375 --> 29:04.709
(Shelly)
'Heard you were back.'

29:04.792 --> 29:06.792
Just wanted to stop
by and say hello.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.250
Brought you some cupcakes.

29:09.333 --> 29:12.458
(Ed)
'Wow. Cupcakes. Thanks.'

29:12.542 --> 29:15.000
- Hey, um, do you want a beer?
- Sure.

29:17.375 --> 29:19.166
(Shelly)
'Figured you could use
some cheering up.'

29:19.250 --> 29:21.333
First, thought maybe

29:21.417 --> 29:23.500
I'd bring you a dog
from the animal shelter.

29:23.583 --> 29:25.834
Yeah, I'll stick
with the cupcakes.

29:25.917 --> 29:27.583
Oh, you don't like animals?

29:27.667 --> 29:29.542
No, I, I, uh...
I do.

29:29.625 --> 29:30.625
I had a dog
when I was a kid.

29:30.709 --> 29:31.834
Oh, yeah?
What kind?

29:31.917 --> 29:33.000
Just a mutt.

29:33.083 --> 29:35.000
Um, we named him
after that weird museum

29:35.083 --> 29:36.750
on the Boardwalk
in Atlantic City.

29:36.834 --> 29:38.834
- Ripley?
- Yeah.

29:38.917 --> 29:40.333
Yeah, he was always
happy to see you.

29:40.417 --> 29:42.458
Oh, yeah,
mutts
are the best.

29:42.542 --> 29:44.500
Never let you
down,
less disease.

29:44.583 --> 29:46.041
But when he did get sick,
you know, we just

29:46.125 --> 29:48.667
we just didn't have the money
to take him to a vet.

29:48.750 --> 29:50.500
That's what you want to do,
right, be a vet?

29:50.583 --> 29:52.458
Trying. It's hard.

29:52.542 --> 29:55.333
You know, going to school
and holding down a job.

29:55.417 --> 29:56.709
Yeah.

29:58.458 --> 29:59.542
How's your..
How's your car?

29:59.625 --> 30:01.875
Ugh! Worse.

30:01.959 --> 30:03.750
It's making this
horrible noise.

30:03.834 --> 30:05.875
Hmm. Right when
you turn it on?

30:05.959 --> 30:07.417
Yeah, it's like
it's screaming in
pain.

30:07.500 --> 30:10.625
Yeah. Probably just a belt.
Drop it off at the shop?

30:10.709 --> 30:11.792
Oh, I did, but they said

30:11.875 --> 30:13.291
they didn't know
what was wrong with it.

30:15.041 --> 30:16.542
It's just dying.

30:16.625 --> 30:18.458
- But I can't afford a new
one.
- I can fix it.

30:18.542 --> 30:20.333
Oh, I thought you were done
with that place.

30:20.417 --> 30:21.625
I'll just call Tommy.

30:21.709 --> 30:22.834
I mean, he's always
looking for a good mechanic.

30:22.917 --> 30:25.250
Yeah, me, too.

30:27.625 --> 30:33.333
I mean, um..
if that's what you want to
do.

30:33.417 --> 30:34.750
Yeah.

30:36.458 --> 30:37.875
It sure is.

30:41.166 --> 30:42.834
Thanks, Shelly.

30:42.917 --> 30:44.291
Why're you thanking me?

30:47.834 --> 30:50.959
Ed left me a message
to pick up my car.

30:51.041 --> 30:53.792
The garage said I owed them
two grand for the work.

30:53.875 --> 30:56.250
Told them, no thanks.
I'll take the bus.

30:57.834 --> 30:59.917
Ed happen to mention
if he had any money left?

31:00.000 --> 31:01.792
No, and I didn't ask him.

31:03.500 --> 31:05.166
Honestly..

31:05.250 --> 31:07.125
...I think he was glad
to be rid of it.

31:13.792 --> 31:15.250
(Lilly)
'You see what I see?'

31:15.333 --> 31:18.041
- Ripley.
- Man's best friend.

31:18.125 --> 31:20.458
Ed's childhood dog.

31:20.542 --> 31:23.625
Dear old sis figured
out his PIN number?

31:23.709 --> 31:25.375
That, or she knew it
all along.

31:31.583 --> 31:33.250
Hoping you could enlighten us
on how Ed's probate works, Pam.

31:33.333 --> 31:35.291
Wish I could.
It's been such a
headache.

31:35.375 --> 31:36.792
Been almost two years
since Ed died

31:36.875 --> 31:38.000
and it still isn't closed?

31:38.083 --> 31:39.458
It's so frustrating,
but first

31:39.542 --> 31:41.083
they have to close out
all his accounts.

31:41.166 --> 31:43.583
So it's possible that
there's an active account

31:43.667 --> 31:45.458
still out there in Ed's name
with money in it?

31:45.542 --> 31:47.542
I don't think so.
I don't know.

31:47.625 --> 31:49.125
You're not even curious?

31:49.208 --> 31:51.667
I mean, you've waited so long.

31:52.709 --> 31:54.125
What are you talking about?

31:54.208 --> 31:56.625
You remember the name of
the dog you and Ed had as kids?

31:56.709 --> 31:58.208
Our dog?
You mean Ripley?

31:58.291 --> 31:59.959
Ripley, that's it.
Yeah, great name.

32:00.041 --> 32:01.875
Of course.
I brought him home for Ed

32:01.959 --> 32:04.041
after our dad took off.

32:04.125 --> 32:05.333
Ed loved that dog.

32:05.417 --> 32:08.792
He even used his name
for a PIN number.

32:08.875 --> 32:10.250
But you already knew that.

32:10.333 --> 32:11.583
What? Wait a
minute.
I-I don't--

32:11.667 --> 32:13.250
Looked into your
hardware store.

32:13.333 --> 32:16.333
The bank's got
a lien on it.

32:16.417 --> 32:18.625
Marty and I have
had
some debt issues.

32:18.709 --> 32:20.667
Say, your real estate venture.

32:20.750 --> 32:22.959
Loft conversions,
wasn't it?

32:23.041 --> 32:25.792
Yeah, that market went
south after Ed died.

32:25.875 --> 32:28.000
You slogged through
two long years waiting

32:28.083 --> 32:30.041
for Ed's probate to close.

32:30.125 --> 32:31.333
His debts get paid off

32:31.417 --> 32:33.125
and you're still left
with nothing.

32:33.208 --> 32:35.917
How? Eight million
to zero in six months.

32:36.000 --> 32:37.208
What is this?

32:37.291 --> 32:39.000
I'd be dying to
check
the balance of that

32:39.083 --> 32:40.500
last outstanding
account, too.

32:40.583 --> 32:42.834
Especially if I
had
Ed's bank card.

32:44.208 --> 32:45.875
No.

32:45.959 --> 32:48.291
I loved my brother.

32:48.375 --> 32:51.000
We...argued over money

32:51.083 --> 32:52.500
but we were still family.

32:54.583 --> 32:57.667
We're converting
each
floor into a loft
space.

32:57.750 --> 32:59.583
The kitchen will go here.

32:59.667 --> 33:02.875
And the living
room...
will go here.

33:02.959 --> 33:05.083
Wow.

33:05.166 --> 33:07.500
It looks really,
really good, Pam.

33:07.583 --> 33:10.000
Yeah.
Oh, be careful.

33:10.083 --> 33:12.417
(Ed)
'Good luck.'

33:12.500 --> 33:14.709
Ran into a little
bad luck, Ed.

33:14.792 --> 33:16.417
That's why
I asked you here.

33:19.667 --> 33:23.041
Marty miscalculated
a couple things in the budget.

33:23.125 --> 33:25.083
But with your help,
we can still get these lofts

33:25.166 --> 33:26.667
completed on schedule.

33:26.750 --> 33:29.291
What happened to the check
I gave Marty three weeks
ago?

33:29.375 --> 33:31.083
The other 50,000?

33:31.166 --> 33:33.709
I didn't know about that.

33:33.792 --> 33:35.583
I'm sorry,
Pam,
I just can't

33:35.667 --> 33:37.000
invest any more
money in this.

33:39.792 --> 33:42.875
You spent $150,000
on a race car

33:42.959 --> 33:44.875
and you won't help us out
with a real investment?

33:44.959 --> 33:46.750
The car was
stupid,
blowing all that
cash

33:46.834 --> 33:50.291
but so is trying to solve
everybody else's problems.

33:50.375 --> 33:52.917
Everyone else?

33:53.000 --> 33:56.208
It just
complicates
things, Pam.

33:56.291 --> 33:58.625
In a bad way.

34:00.375 --> 34:02.333
You're right.
I'm sorry.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.250
- Don't worry about us.
- Yeah?

34:05.333 --> 34:07.834
- You'll be alright?
- Yeah, of course.

34:07.917 --> 34:09.500
- Okay.
- We have other options.

34:09.583 --> 34:10.959
Business line of credit

34:11.041 --> 34:13.291
home equity line,
yeah.

34:13.375 --> 34:15.125
We'll be fine.

34:16.625 --> 34:17.917
Question is,
are you gonna be okay?

34:18.000 --> 34:20.959
Yeah. I'm trying to get
back to where I started.

34:23.041 --> 34:24.792
Are you completely broke, Ed?

34:24.875 --> 34:26.500
Hey, I got my old job back.

34:28.750 --> 34:30.792
I think everything's
gonna work out
alright.

34:33.709 --> 34:35.709
I was so embarrassed.

34:35.792 --> 34:39.625
It's hard enough
to ask someone for
money.

34:39.709 --> 34:42.125
It must've been even
harder
for Ed to turn us down.

34:42.208 --> 34:43.458
So your husband
never told you

34:43.542 --> 34:45.250
he had already hit
Ed up for 50,000?

34:45.333 --> 34:46.667
(Shelly)
'Marty got in over his head.'

34:46.750 --> 34:49.375
He'd shut down
whenever I brought up
money.

34:49.458 --> 34:51.333
(Vera)
'This is a consent form.'

34:51.417 --> 34:54.458
It allows us
to search your store.

34:54.542 --> 34:56.458
The store?
I don't understand.

34:56.542 --> 34:58.041
Well, it would just
help us to clear

34:58.125 --> 34:59.333
both you and your husband.

34:59.417 --> 35:02.166
Marty?
But that's ridiculous.

35:02.250 --> 35:04.333
You don't think
for a minute that Marty..

35:05.667 --> 35:07.500
Do I need a lawyer?

35:07.583 --> 35:09.083
Only if you have
something to hide.

35:26.417 --> 35:28.792
That's a filthy habit, Marty.

35:30.041 --> 35:33.166
I had a
girlfriend,
chewed her
nails.

35:33.250 --> 35:34.458
It drove me crazy.

35:34.542 --> 35:37.125
Yeah, I guess, you take
it all on yourself, huh?

35:37.208 --> 35:38.917
Run business,
paying the
bills--

35:39.000 --> 35:40.667
- Why am I here, detective?
- I'm just saying.

35:40.750 --> 35:43.041
If I got myself
into money
trouble

35:43.125 --> 35:45.166
I'd have a chat
with the little
lady.

35:45.250 --> 35:48.792
You know, not...be a
coward
about it, that's all.

35:48.875 --> 35:50.875
I know how to handle
my own business, thank you.

35:50.959 --> 35:54.709
(Valens)
'Is that why your wife had to
go
beg her brother for more

35:54.792 --> 35:56.417
- And not after you?
- Pam told you that?

35:56.500 --> 35:59.834
Also said you screwed up
big time on that loft
project.

35:59.917 --> 36:01.375
No, we just needed
enough to get started

36:01.458 --> 36:02.709
with the construction,
that's it.

36:02.792 --> 36:04.625
He already gave you a 100K.

36:04.709 --> 36:06.083
Hell, I'd have
turned you down,
too.

36:06.166 --> 36:08.166
A hundred thousand
was nothing!

36:08.250 --> 36:09.625
He had eight million.

36:09.709 --> 36:13.041
Did you even like
your brother-in-law,
Marty?

36:13.125 --> 36:14.375
Yeah, I did.

36:15.583 --> 36:17.208
I loved Ed.

36:18.750 --> 36:20.375
I treated him
like he was my own.

36:20.458 --> 36:23.250
And he repaid you by saying no
when you needed him most.

36:23.333 --> 36:25.166
- Are we finished here?
- Sit down!

36:28.166 --> 36:29.583
Where were you
night Ed got
shot?

36:29.667 --> 36:30.792
Where I am every night.

36:30.875 --> 36:33.583
Home with Pam.
Ask her.

36:33.667 --> 36:37.083
He was with me,
watching TV.

36:37.166 --> 36:38.750
- Thank you.
- Watching what?

36:41.625 --> 36:44.083
I don't know, um..

36:44.166 --> 36:47.083
Uh...Wheel of Fortune.

36:47.166 --> 36:49.083
The rest of the night?

36:50.667 --> 36:53.417
And Marty
never went out?

36:53.500 --> 36:55.583
I mean, um..

36:55.667 --> 36:58.125
...sometimes he went back
to the store to close.

36:58.208 --> 37:00.000
To clean up, you know,
to make sure it was locked up.

37:00.083 --> 37:02.959
Oh, so he left to go back
to the store that night?

37:04.166 --> 37:06.125
I don't know. I don't know.
I can't remember.

37:06.208 --> 37:08.458
You remember what
you were watching
but..

37:08.542 --> 37:10.709
...you don't
remember
if he went out?

37:10.792 --> 37:13.208
Where's, where is Marty?
I need to talk to him.

37:13.291 --> 37:14.834
How did he react
when you told him

37:14.917 --> 37:18.166
that Ed wasn't gonna
give you the money?

37:18.250 --> 37:20.125
He must've been
angry,
wasn't he?

37:20.208 --> 37:22.500
What? No.

37:22.583 --> 37:24.375
No, it wasn't like that.

37:24.458 --> 37:27.041
Oh, everything you
did
for him, raised him

37:27.125 --> 37:29.291
when your father
couldn't be
bothered.

37:29.375 --> 37:32.458
We did what was right.
What we had to do.

37:32.542 --> 37:36.125
But Ed
didn't.
Did he?

37:36.208 --> 37:40.458
The fact that you had to,
you know, even ask for money?

37:40.542 --> 37:42.792
Marty had a right to be upset.

37:42.875 --> 37:46.208
No.
No, Marty loved Ed.

37:51.750 --> 37:53.333
He was my brother.

38:14.625 --> 38:15.709
Got it.

38:25.583 --> 38:28.041
Eight million dollars.

38:38.125 --> 38:39.417
Oh, jeez.

38:39.500 --> 38:41.208
Marty, you scared me.

38:41.291 --> 38:42.709
Wait, wait,
what are you doing
here?

38:42.792 --> 38:45.375
Did you really tell Pam
you wouldn't help us out, Ed?

38:45.458 --> 38:47.208
Come on, Marty,
I'm done talking about
money.

38:47.291 --> 38:49.875
Do you know how hard it was
to ask you for that?

38:51.125 --> 38:52.208
Marty, I'm sorry.

38:52.291 --> 38:53.583
I can't pay for
your
business
mistakes.

38:53.667 --> 38:55.208
My mistakes?

38:55.291 --> 38:56.542
We had to
delay construction

38:56.625 --> 38:57.750
because your sister
didn't get the permits.

38:57.834 --> 38:58.917
I don't know
what to tell
you.

38:59.000 --> 39:00.458
We might lose the store.

39:00.542 --> 39:01.834
- What?
- The store, Ed!

39:01.917 --> 39:03.417
Where you grew up!

39:03.500 --> 39:05.000
Does that mean
anything to you?

39:05.083 --> 39:06.333
Pam didn't say
anything about
that.

39:06.417 --> 39:08.625
I just..
I don't get it, man.

39:10.417 --> 39:11.917
I mean, after all
we did for you.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.291
All the sacrifices
we made for you.

39:14.375 --> 39:16.083
Look, I'm sorry, Marty.
I can't give you the
money.

39:16.166 --> 39:17.709
I don't,
I don't have
it.

39:17.792 --> 39:19.000
I don't believe you.

39:21.834 --> 39:25.834
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry, Eddie.

39:25.917 --> 39:28.709
The money's coming to us
whether you're dead or alive.

39:28.792 --> 39:30.083
No, it's not.

39:30.166 --> 39:32.000
- It's all gone.
- That's not true!

39:32.083 --> 39:34.208
I gave to someone
who deserved it.

39:34.291 --> 39:36.083
The only person
who didn't ask me for it--

39:44.250 --> 39:48.291
Well, it turns out, there
was
more money out there, Pam.

39:48.375 --> 39:49.667
Shame you'll never see it.

39:53.583 --> 39:55.291
Where did you get this?

39:55.375 --> 39:56.792
Your dresser drawer.

39:56.875 --> 40:00.166
The search consent you
signed
was also for your home.

40:02.458 --> 40:04.792
- Marty?
- No, not Marty.

40:06.583 --> 40:07.875
You.

40:07.959 --> 40:10.792
You knew the PIN number.

40:10.875 --> 40:13.333
The card's gonna have
your prints all over
it.

40:13.417 --> 40:17.417
You waited so long
you finally just had
to..

40:17.500 --> 40:19.458
...check that
account,
didn't you?

40:19.542 --> 40:20.875
I didn't shoot my brother.

40:20.959 --> 40:22.917
No, you sent your
husband
to do the dirty work

40:23.000 --> 40:24.917
then you tried
to throw him under the
bus.

40:25.000 --> 40:26.083
How dare you?

40:26.166 --> 40:28.709
All you did for
Ed
all those years.

40:28.792 --> 40:30.709
How could he
just blow it
all?

40:30.792 --> 40:32.625
Even gave some
to your father.

40:32.709 --> 40:34.667
- No, he didn't.
- Oh, yes he did, Pam.

40:34.750 --> 40:37.917
Somehow he cared more
about Jack than you.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.291
My father was a bum.

40:40.375 --> 40:41.792
Without me..

40:41.875 --> 40:43.667
...they would've put Ed
into the system.

40:43.750 --> 40:44.667
He was eight years old.

40:44.750 --> 40:47.375
And the one time
you came to him

40:47.458 --> 40:48.750
he turned you down.

40:48.834 --> 40:51.417
I was his sister.
And he owed me!

40:54.500 --> 40:56.041
(Ed)
'...someone
who deserved it.'

40:56.125 --> 40:57.375
'The only person
who didn't ask me for it.'

41:01.458 --> 41:02.875
It's over.

41:10.625 --> 41:11.792
No..

41:27.458 --> 41:28.917
Oh..

41:29.000 --> 41:30.583
...I'm sorry.
