not Rex Banner,

10:18.492 --> 10:19.410
not anyone.

10:28.419 --> 10:31.797
(scoffs) Rex Banner--
what a dope.

10:31.881 --> 10:34.842
Yeah. Look at him trying
to aim that stupid gun.

10:34.925 --> 10:35.843
(both scream)

10:35.926 --> 10:37.762
(siren wailing)

10:37.845 --> 10:39.096
Hang on, son!

10:43.017 --> 10:45.686
Dad, knocking over
a gravestone is bad luck.

10:45.770 --> 10:47.563
Really?
I heard good.

10:54.612 --> 10:56.739
What happened
to you, Homer?

10:56.822 --> 10:58.282
And what have
you done to the car?

10:58.366 --> 10:59.784
Nothin'.

10:59.867 --> 11:02.662
I don't think it had
broken axles before.

11:02.745 --> 11:03.954
Before! Before!

11:04.038 --> 11:05.748
You're livin'
in the past, Marge.

11:05.831 --> 11:06.749
Quit livin' in the past.

11:10.252 --> 11:11.379
That's funny.

11:11.462 --> 11:13.923
I used to be able
to go down there.

11:15.424 --> 11:17.677
Going bowling.
Not back, avenge deaths.

11:17.760 --> 11:19.637
Why do you have
so many bowling balls?

11:19.720 --> 11:21.055
Uh...

11:21.138 --> 11:23.307
I'm not gonna lie
to you, Marge.

11:23.391 --> 11:24.642
So long!

11:24.725 --> 11:25.935
(door closes)

11:26.018 --> 11:28.145
(car speeding away)

11:28.229 --> 11:29.313
(growls)

11:34.735 --> 11:37.655
Ah, rats!
Another gutter ball!

11:37.738 --> 11:40.074
Gee, Homer
you sure do suck tonight.

11:40.157 --> 11:42.326
Yeah, suck like a fox!

11:42.410 --> 11:43.536
(both laughing)

12:02.430 --> 12:04.515
Here you go, barn.
That'll be 45 bucks.

12:04.598 --> 12:06.684
45 bucks?!

12:06.767 --> 12:09.937
Well, this better be the
best-tasting beer in the world.

12:11.731 --> 12:12.648
You got lucky.

12:19.280 --> 12:22.700
You see, boy, the real money
is in bootlegging,

12:22.783 --> 12:24.827
not in your
childish vandalism.

12:24.910 --> 12:27.496
Oh, so many
wasted nights.

12:29.749 --> 12:31.333
What's the matter,
chief?

12:31.417 --> 12:33.461
Yeah, you've barely touched
your Banana Kaboom.

12:35.087 --> 12:37.715
This isn't a very
happy birthday for Rex Banner.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.636
(Barney mumbling)

12:46.640 --> 12:48.642
Hello, fishies!

12:48.726 --> 12:49.727
(belches)

12:49.810 --> 12:51.395
(screaming)

12:51.479 --> 12:53.564
Listen, rummy, I'm going
to say it plain and simple:

12:53.647 --> 12:54.982
Where'd you
pinch the hooch?

12:55.065 --> 12:57.777
Is some blind tiger
jerking suds on the side?

12:57.860 --> 12:59.195
Yes?

13:00.696 --> 13:02.406
Wait a minute.

13:02.490 --> 13:05.493
I forgot to make sure
the coast was clear.

13:05.576 --> 13:08.037
Ah, it's probably clear.
Let's go.

13:08.120 --> 13:09.830
(yelps)

13:09.914 --> 13:10.915
Beer!

13:10.998 --> 13:11.916
I can explain, Marge.

13:11.999 --> 13:13.417
Please let me explain.

13:13.501 --> 13:16.295
(wailing) Oh, why won't
let me explain?!

13:16.378 --> 13:18.255
You're the one the papers
have been talking about--

13:18.339 --> 13:20.132
that mysterious "beer baron"

13:20.216 --> 13:22.092
who's been supplying Springfield
with alcohol.

13:22.176 --> 13:24.553
How have you been
getting away with this?

13:24.637 --> 13:26.764
Well... and I can
explain, remember?

13:26.847 --> 13:29.225
I fill the balls with beer
that I found at the dump

13:29.308 --> 13:31.143
and then I bowl them
and some underground pipes

13:31.227 --> 13:32.228
take them into Moe's.

13:32.311 --> 13:34.313
Homer, that's very clever.

13:34.396 --> 13:36.232
-Huh?
-Mom!

13:36.315 --> 13:38.818
Well, it is. I've known your father
since high school,

13:38.901 --> 13:40.611
and this is the cleverest
things he's ever done.

13:40.694 --> 13:43.322
Besides, he's only breaking
a silly, 200-year-old law.

13:43.405 --> 13:44.865
It is silly, Marge.

13:44.949 --> 13:46.367
And look at all the
money I'm making.

13:46.450 --> 13:48.118
Whoo!

13:48.202 --> 13:50.955
Mom! Prohibition
may be unpopular,

13:51.038 --> 13:53.040
but it's the law,
and we still have--

13:53.123 --> 13:54.291
ALL:
Go to your room, Lisa.

13:57.211 --> 13:58.087
(pounding on door)

14:01.549 --> 14:02.466
Open up, curly.

14:02.550 --> 14:03.843
This is a raid.

14:03.926 --> 14:05.928
A raid?!
Curly?!

14:06.011 --> 14:09.098
Um, all right, but, uh...

14:09.181 --> 14:12.142
I don't know what you
expect to find

14:12.226 --> 14:16.856
in a, uh, simple, uh...
neighborhood... pet shop.

14:22.027 --> 14:23.362
Pet shop, eh?

14:23.445 --> 14:25.155
Well, I just have
one question:

14:25.239 --> 14:26.448
What kind of pet shop

14:26.532 --> 14:28.158
is filled with
rambunctious yahoos

14:28.242 --> 14:30.077
and hot jazz music
at 1:00 a.m.?

14:30.160 --> 14:31.537
Um...

14:31.620 --> 14:34.331
uh...

14:34.415 --> 14:37.293
the... best... damn...
pet shop in town!

14:37.376 --> 14:39.128
PATRONS: Yeah!

14:39.211 --> 14:40.170
All right,

14:40.254 --> 14:41.547
but you people remember:

14:41.630 --> 14:43.591
Baby turtles and alligators

14:43.674 --> 14:45.926
may seem like a cute idea
for a pet,

14:46.010 --> 14:47.428
but they grow up.

14:47.511 --> 14:48.554
Let's go, boys.

14:55.060 --> 14:56.437
Ow!

14:56.520 --> 14:58.439
Those gears down there
really hurt.

15:02.776 --> 15:05.237
You're out there somewhere,
beer baron,

15:05.321 --> 15:07.531
and I'll find you.

15:07.615 --> 15:09.533
HOMER (distant):
No, you won't.

15:09.617 --> 15:11.577
Yes, I will.

15:11.660 --> 15:13.287
HOMER: Won't.

15:15.789 --> 15:16.749
NARRATOR:
<i>Dateline Springfield.</i>

15:16.832 --> 15:18.417
<i>The illusive beer baron</i>

15:18.500 --> 15:19.919
<i>continued to thumb his nose</i>
<i>at authorities.</i>

15:20.002 --> 15:21.587
<i>Swaggering about</i>
<i>in a garish new hat</i>

15:21.670 --> 15:23.631
<i>he seemed to say,</i>
<i>"Look at me, Rex Banner.</i>

15:23.714 --> 15:25.299
<i>I have a new hat."</i>

15:26.926 --> 15:28.218
Hey, boy, get cracking.

15:28.302 --> 15:30.137
Moe upped his order
to 20 balls a night.

15:30.220 --> 15:31.597
Uh, Dad--

15:31.680 --> 15:33.474
Call me beer baron.

15:33.557 --> 15:35.684
All the beer from the landfill
is gone, beer baron.

15:35.768 --> 15:36.894
We're out of business.

15:38.812 --> 15:40.105
But I can't be out of beer.

15:40.189 --> 15:42.900
I'm the beer baron.

15:42.983 --> 15:45.069
Homer, my customers
are sobering up,

15:45.152 --> 15:47.071
and they ain't gonna
stick around for the ambiance.

15:47.154 --> 15:48.864
You got to get me more beer.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.282
Sorry. I'm all out.

15:50.366 --> 15:52.326
How about some turpentine
or caulk?

15:52.409 --> 15:53.786
Delicious caulk.

15:53.869 --> 15:55.871
Look, find it, buy it,
make it, I don't care.

15:55.955 --> 15:58.374
Just get me some booze
and fast.

15:58.457 --> 16:00.000
Make it, eh?

16:01.961 --> 16:03.921
Forty-two bathtubs, please.

16:04.004 --> 16:06.298
You know, they're 50
for $3,000 today.

16:06.382 --> 16:07.383
I said 42!

16:14.306 --> 16:16.517
Now you're making
your own alcohol?

16:16.600 --> 16:19.186
That's more illegal than
what you were doing before.

16:19.269 --> 16:21.605
(laughing)
Remember, honey,

16:21.689 --> 16:23.357
we're disobeying
an unjust law here.

16:23.440 --> 16:25.025
We're patriots.

16:25.109 --> 16:27.945
Like...
all those people in jail.

16:32.533 --> 16:33.784
(cheering)

16:36.370 --> 16:37.997
(sniffing)

16:38.080 --> 16:39.665
Who wants a bathtub mint julep?

16:46.505 --> 16:48.090
Are you the beer baron?

16:48.173 --> 16:49.675
If you're talking
about root beer,

16:49.758 --> 16:53.095
I plead guilt-didilly-ilty
as char-didilly-arged.

16:53.178 --> 16:55.097
He's not the baron,
but he sounds drunk.

16:55.180 --> 16:56.598
Take him in.

16:57.725 --> 16:59.309
Are you the beer baron?

16:59.393 --> 17:00.894
Yes, but only by night.

17:00.978 --> 17:02.688
By day,
I'm a mild-mannered reporter

17:02.771 --> 17:04.398
for a major metropolitan
newspaper.

17:04.481 --> 17:06.483
Don't crack wise
with me, tubby.

17:06.567 --> 17:07.735
Tubby?

17:07.818 --> 17:10.237
Oh, yes, tubby.

17:10.320 --> 17:11.697
Hey, Banner,
how's it hanging?

17:11.780 --> 17:13.198
None of your business.

17:15.200 --> 17:18.537
(rumbling)

17:18.620 --> 17:22.332
(both screaming)

17:22.416 --> 17:24.209
What on earth happened
down there?!

17:24.293 --> 17:25.919
One of the stills--

17:26.003 --> 17:27.463
Uh, nothing, Marge.

17:27.546 --> 17:30.215
I think it must have been
that bean I had for dinner.

17:30.299 --> 17:32.926
(explosions)

17:33.010 --> 17:34.553
Ka-boom! Blam!

17:34.636 --> 17:36.346
Oh, excuse me again, dear.

17:36.430 --> 17:38.432
Homer, there's no point
in pretending

17:38.515 --> 17:40.225
you're making those noises.

17:40.309 --> 17:42.770
Your homemade liquor
is exploding again.

17:42.853 --> 17:44.688
What, dear? Ka-blammo!

17:44.772 --> 17:45.981
You made some money

17:46.065 --> 17:48.150
and had the fun of being
a wanted criminal.

17:48.233 --> 17:50.652
Why not quit now
while you're ahead?

17:50.736 --> 17:51.612
-(explosion)
-Boom.

17:55.032 --> 17:56.200
I'll be right back.

17:56.283 --> 17:59.203
(rumbling)

17:59.286 --> 18:01.205
(loud explosion)

18:01.288 --> 18:03.874
(screaming)

18:03.957 --> 18:05.793
It's hot! Oh!

18:05.876 --> 18:09.213
Oh! Oh! Oh!

18:09.296 --> 18:11.256
Whoo.

18:11.340 --> 18:14.051
I've thought about
what you said, honey,

18:14.134 --> 18:16.053
and I've decided to quit.

18:16.136 --> 18:18.472
Oh, well, fun's over.

18:18.555 --> 18:20.891
But I still have
my wonderful money.

18:20.974 --> 18:22.434
Stick 'em up!

18:22.518 --> 18:25.062
Geez, what happened to you,
Wiggum? You look terrible.

18:25.145 --> 18:26.438
Never mind how I look.

18:26.522 --> 18:27.940
You gonna give me
the money or not?

18:28.023 --> 18:29.358
Well, I don't think so.

18:29.441 --> 18:31.318
You don't even have
a trigger on that thing.

18:31.401 --> 18:33.237
Yeah, I had to sell the trigger
and most of the handle

18:33.320 --> 18:34.780
to feed my family.

18:34.863 --> 18:35.989
Come on, give me the dough.

18:36.073 --> 18:38.242
I can throw this pretty hard.

18:38.325 --> 18:40.077
Poor Wiggum.

18:40.160 --> 18:41.411
Poor Wiggum.

18:41.495 --> 18:43.622
I'll bet you really hate
Rex Banner, huh?

18:43.705 --> 18:44.915
Um... who?

18:44.998 --> 18:46.458
The guy who took your job.

18:46.542 --> 18:47.501
Oh, yeah.

18:47.584 --> 18:49.378
More than anything in the world.

18:49.461 --> 18:52.339
Hey, how would you
like to show him up

18:52.422 --> 18:54.258
by beating him
at his own game?

18:55.843 --> 18:57.928
(cheering)

18:58.011 --> 18:59.513
I'm happy to report

18:59.596 --> 19:02.432
that the flow of illegal liquor
seems to have dried up.

19:02.516 --> 19:03.892
Public drunkenness has ceased

19:03.976 --> 19:05.269
and those
mysterious liquor clouds

19:05.352 --> 19:07.521
over Evergreen Terrace
are gone.

19:07.604 --> 19:11.275
People, Rex Banner has won
your war against alcohol.

19:11.358 --> 19:12.860
(cheering)

19:12.943 --> 19:14.444
What about
the beer baron?

19:14.528 --> 19:17.197
I suspect he was just
an invention of the media.

19:17.281 --> 19:18.657
The idea that someone like that

19:18.740 --> 19:21.869
could operate under my very nose
is laughable.

19:21.952 --> 19:22.911
(gasping)

19:22.995 --> 19:24.621
(gagging)

19:26.540 --> 19:28.375
Well, you all know
what laughter sounds like.

19:28.458 --> 19:30.252
We now go live
to Evergreen Terrace

19:30.335 --> 19:31.920
where I'm informed

19:32.004 --> 19:35.299
that former police chief Wiggum
has captured the beer baron.

19:35.382 --> 19:36.341
(gasping)

19:36.425 --> 19:37.342
They captured Homer?

19:38.969 --> 19:41.471
Then the liquor-filled
bowling balls traveled

19:41.555 --> 19:43.473
through a network
of underground pipes

19:43.557 --> 19:46.643
finally emerging
at a nearby speakeasy.

19:46.727 --> 19:48.520
You forgot
one thing, Wiggum.

19:48.604 --> 19:49.771
Yeah? What's that?

19:49.855 --> 19:52.816
I filled the balls
with a funnel.

19:52.900 --> 19:57.070
That was a very sweet thing
you did for poor Wiggum.

19:57.154 --> 19:58.822
But what's going
to happen to you?

19:58.906 --> 20:01.533
Oh, probably
just a slap on the wrist.

20:01.617 --> 20:04.453
"And he who shall
violate this law

20:04.536 --> 20:06.580
shall be punished
by catapult."

20:06.663 --> 20:08.207
(grunting)

20:08.290 --> 20:09.416
Last time I help you.

20:09.499 --> 20:11.460
Sorry. I thought
you'd get a fine

20:11.543 --> 20:13.253
or at most,
three, four years in jail.

20:13.337 --> 20:14.546
BANNER: Hold it.

20:14.630 --> 20:16.798
This machine
is two centuries old.

20:16.882 --> 20:17.799
Better test it first.

20:22.179 --> 20:23.180
(yowling)

20:23.263 --> 20:24.806
Okay. Go ahead.

20:24.890 --> 20:27.517
Wait! Wait!
You can't do this!

20:27.601 --> 20:31.021
All my husband did was violate
a law that doesn't make sense.

20:31.104 --> 20:32.648
Now, I'll admit

20:32.731 --> 20:35.525
car crashes and fistfights
have been down recently,

20:35.609 --> 20:38.403
but prohibition
has cost us our freedom--

20:38.487 --> 20:41.114
our freedom to drink.

20:41.198 --> 20:42.950
Now hold on
a minute, missy.

20:43.033 --> 20:45.410
It's not up to us to choose
which laws we want to obey.

20:45.494 --> 20:48.997
If it were, I'd kill everyone
who looked at me cockeyed.

20:49.081 --> 20:51.375
Our laws are in place
for a reason.

20:51.458 --> 20:53.210
Send him back
to mama, boys.

20:53.293 --> 20:55.087
(yelling)

20:57.547 --> 20:59.299
That was unexpected.

20:59.383 --> 21:02.844
Well, reset the catapult,
and let's get this over with.

21:02.928 --> 21:04.429
CLERK: Wait.

21:04.513 --> 21:06.932
I've discovered more lines
on the parchment.

21:07.015 --> 21:09.559
It says that
the prohibition law

21:09.643 --> 21:12.145
which was passed here
200 years ago

21:12.229 --> 21:16.441
was repealed 199 years ago.

21:16.525 --> 21:17.609
Release the prisoner.

21:20.612 --> 21:23.198
On behalf of the city,
I'd like to apologize

21:23.282 --> 21:25.033
and ask how long
it will take for you

21:25.117 --> 21:27.077
to flood this town
with booze again.

21:27.160 --> 21:29.204
Well, sorry.

21:29.288 --> 21:30.998
I'm not in
that business anymore.

21:31.081 --> 21:33.333
Four minutes.

21:33.417 --> 21:36.003
NARRATOR:<i> And so, one town's</i>
<i>brief flirtation with prohibition</i>

21:36.086 --> 21:38.547
<i>ended in a joyous remarriage</i>

21:38.630 --> 21:40.674
<i>Congratulations,</i>
<i>Springfield.</i>

21:40.757 --> 21:43.218
<i>We wish you the very best.</i>

21:43.302 --> 21:44.636
To alcohol--

21:44.720 --> 21:47.806
the cause of
and solution to

21:47.889 --> 21:50.225
all of life's problems.

21:50.309 --> 21:52.436
(cheering)

22:40.192 --> 22:41.735
Shh!
