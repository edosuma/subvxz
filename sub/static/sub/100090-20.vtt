WEBVTT

00:06.180 --> 00:08.138
- Out of the car nice and slow.

00:08.182 --> 00:09.705
You feel like a man now, huh?

00:09.748 --> 00:11.533
Get your black ass
on your knees right now!

00:14.014 --> 00:16.016
- Those punks murdered Daryl
over nothing--

00:16.059 --> 00:17.539
driving
while being black.

00:17.582 --> 00:19.410
- I've done research
on this cop Doyle.

00:19.454 --> 00:21.151
He's got a track record.

00:21.195 --> 00:22.979
This isn't about you anymore.

00:23.023 --> 00:25.025
This is about the future
of Chicago.

00:25.068 --> 00:27.070
- You gotta do
what you think is right.

00:27.114 --> 00:29.029
Just keep in mind,
you're a cop.

00:29.072 --> 00:31.727
- You backed me?
I appreciate that, bro.

00:31.770 --> 00:34.208
- No, I didn't come down here
to shake hands and make up.

00:36.297 --> 00:37.863
You may not go down
for that murder,

00:37.907 --> 00:40.170
but I will get your badge
one way or the other.

00:42.390 --> 00:44.131
- It's pizza.
It can't be that bad.

00:44.174 --> 00:46.176
- It is.
It's like a sheet of paper.

00:46.220 --> 00:47.525
- Well, deep dish is waiting.

00:47.569 --> 00:48.874
When you're back,
we'll hit Bartoli's.

00:48.918 --> 00:50.093
- Deal.

00:50.137 --> 00:51.399
- You are coming back, right?

00:51.442 --> 00:54.097
- Yeah, I miss the wind...

00:54.141 --> 00:55.707
and you.

00:55.751 --> 00:56.969
- So you miss me, do you?

00:57.013 --> 00:59.059
- Shut up. I gotta go.

00:59.102 --> 01:00.886
- Yeah, talk soon.
Morning, Sarge.

01:00.930 --> 01:04.107
- Hey, listen, Adam and Kim
are case-on-case on this thing,

01:04.151 --> 01:05.935
so take us through.
- All right.

01:05.978 --> 01:08.590
Three months ago,
an unlicensed mini Uzi was used

01:08.633 --> 01:10.940
by a deranged white male
in a black church shooting.

01:10.983 --> 01:13.551
Now, luckily for us,
nobody was seriously injured.

01:13.595 --> 01:16.685
A week ago, the same type
of Uzi was used in a drive-by

01:16.728 --> 01:19.427
at a G-Park Lord's funeral.
We got two dead.

01:19.470 --> 01:21.559
The shooter was caught,
but he lawyered up.

01:21.603 --> 01:24.084
- OCD Intel says the Uzis
were stolen in Indiana

01:24.127 --> 01:25.737
and then transported into town.

01:25.781 --> 01:28.523
Our top priority target
is this guy, Tony Reed,

01:28.566 --> 01:31.134
part-time biker,
part-time alt-right agitator.

01:31.178 --> 01:33.310
He did two stints in Danville
for meth distro

01:33.354 --> 01:35.138
before pivoting into guns.

01:35.182 --> 01:37.445
Now, Tony,
he stays in the shadows

01:37.488 --> 01:39.403
and relies on these
small-time punks

01:39.447 --> 01:41.013
to distribute the weapons,

01:41.057 --> 01:42.450
like this guy, JHawk261,

01:42.493 --> 01:45.192
who posted that charming photo
on Instagram two days ago.

01:45.235 --> 01:47.542
- And we got Kev
in play as a buyer.

01:47.585 --> 01:50.414
Plan is, bust this JHawk,
get him to flip on Reed.

01:50.458 --> 01:51.633
- Does JHawk know
you're black?

01:51.676 --> 01:53.461
- Yeah, I'm fronting
as a big dog

01:53.504 --> 01:55.071
for the 88th Street Vipers.

01:55.115 --> 01:57.029
My vibe is, he likes
selling to brothers

01:57.073 --> 01:59.380
because he feels like we're
just gonna wipe each other out,

01:59.423 --> 02:00.946
help his cause anyway.

02:00.990 --> 02:03.297
We got a get-to-know-you offer
for five Uzis on the table,

02:03.340 --> 02:05.777
the meeting's in two hours,
and I can't wait.

02:05.821 --> 02:07.083
- All right, as soon as Kev
makes the sale,

02:07.127 --> 02:08.389
we move in fast.

02:08.432 --> 02:11.218
He reaches for a weapon,

02:11.261 --> 02:12.523
light his ass up.

02:12.567 --> 02:14.395
- Copy that.
- Let's go.

02:23.491 --> 02:25.884
- We got eyes on Kev.
Red Camry pulling up.

02:25.928 --> 02:27.451
- I'm running the tags now.

02:30.846 --> 02:33.588
Okay, car belongs
to Jeffrey Alan Hill.

02:34.676 --> 02:36.460
He's got two priors
for meth possession.

02:36.504 --> 02:38.332
I'm guessing this is JHawk.

02:39.507 --> 02:42.205
- You shopping?

02:42.249 --> 02:44.686
- You JHawk?
- That's me.

02:49.038 --> 02:50.735
- You serious?

02:50.779 --> 02:52.737
- All good.

02:52.781 --> 02:53.869
Let's go inside.

02:53.912 --> 02:55.697
- That wasn't part of the plan.

02:55.740 --> 02:58.003
- That's where
the groceries are, dude.

02:58.047 --> 02:59.788
- Let's do it.

03:07.274 --> 03:10.364
- 'Sup, boys?
Where are the sweepers?

03:10.407 --> 03:12.192
- D's cleaning them.
- Where the hell's D?

03:12.235 --> 03:13.584
- Right here.

03:13.628 --> 03:15.673
Polished and shined,
thing of beauty.

03:15.717 --> 03:18.067
I'm telling you, these things
are gonna blow you away.

03:21.984 --> 03:23.768
- Whoa, boss.

03:23.812 --> 03:25.205
You gotta be kidding me.
That's Tom Doyle.

03:25.248 --> 03:26.858
- Mm.
- Who the hell's Tom Doyle?

03:26.902 --> 03:28.208
- He's a cop.

03:28.251 --> 03:29.383
- Who pulled over Atwater
while he was undercover

03:29.426 --> 03:31.080
and put a gun to his head.
- Easy, easy.

03:31.123 --> 03:32.124
- If he's dirty,
we got a problem.

03:32.168 --> 03:33.517
- Just let it play.

03:34.562 --> 03:36.172
- What the hell is this?

03:36.216 --> 03:37.782
Huh?

03:39.654 --> 03:41.525
A lot of buyers in Chicago.
You bring this?

03:41.569 --> 03:43.571
- The only color
Reed cares about is green.

03:43.614 --> 03:46.878
- Anybody even bother to do
the 411 on him?

03:48.402 --> 03:50.882
- I'm just here for business.

03:50.926 --> 03:52.536
We still got a deal or not?

03:53.842 --> 03:57.019
- You need to get up on out
of here, you hear me?

03:58.107 --> 04:00.762
I said run along, son.

04:00.805 --> 04:02.285
- Don't call me son.

04:08.726 --> 04:10.075
I'ma give you a call
later, bro,

04:10.119 --> 04:11.773
when you realize
that your boy here's trippin'

04:11.816 --> 04:13.253
and he don't know what the hell
he's talking about.

04:15.385 --> 04:18.388
- I said run along.

04:40.541 --> 04:42.107
- What the hell was that?

04:42.151 --> 04:44.414
- Spoke to Platt.

04:44.458 --> 04:47.112
Apparently, Area South's
got Doyle working undercover

04:47.156 --> 04:48.462
with Tony Reed's crew.

04:48.505 --> 04:51.334
- Doyle's patrol.
- He got promoted to detective.

04:51.378 --> 04:53.380
- Why didn't Area South
deconflict this?

04:53.423 --> 04:55.338
- I'm going to talk
to his sergeant right now,

04:55.382 --> 04:57.471
and believe me,
I'm gonna find out.

04:57.514 --> 05:00.430
- The deconfliction screwup
is on us, Hank.

05:00.474 --> 05:02.432
Someone made a mistake
with the paperwork.

05:02.476 --> 05:04.042
- That's a hell
of a mistake, Kenny.

05:04.086 --> 05:07.219
- Yeah, one of my guys put
Reed's alias into the system

05:07.263 --> 05:09.570
instead of his real name.
- Huh.

05:09.613 --> 05:11.789
How long's Doyle been under?
Here, have a seat.

05:11.833 --> 05:12.877
- Three months.

05:12.921 --> 05:15.140
It's a long play
to close in on Reed.

05:15.184 --> 05:16.794
- Huh.

05:16.838 --> 05:19.362
- Hey, how about we
compare notes, work together?

05:19.406 --> 05:22.409
Think that's our best shot
to take down Reed.

05:22.452 --> 05:25.412
- Eh, I'm not sure
that's a good idea.

05:25.455 --> 05:27.065
- Hey, look, Hank.

05:27.109 --> 05:31.026
I know what went down last year
between Doyle and Atwater.

05:31.069 --> 05:33.376
I don't think it'd be a problem
on our end.

05:35.378 --> 05:38.120
The kid's a good cop.

05:38.163 --> 05:40.644
It's the only reason
I put him up for detective.

05:40.688 --> 05:43.038
- Got nothing to do with
his father, his two cousins?

05:43.081 --> 05:45.257
- Yeah, I know he's got
a lot of family on the job,

05:45.301 --> 05:47.259
but that wasn't the reason.

05:47.303 --> 05:49.349
On my kids.

05:52.613 --> 05:54.876
- Okay, let's do it.

05:54.919 --> 05:56.094
- Tony Reed
is the head of the snake

05:56.138 --> 05:58.183
of this gun-trafficking
organization.

05:58.227 --> 06:00.403
He's elusive and cagey.

06:00.447 --> 06:01.665
Always works through
an intermediary

06:01.709 --> 06:03.841
like Jeffrey Hill.

06:03.885 --> 06:05.756
That's the reason
I put Doyle under with him.

06:05.800 --> 06:06.801
- Huh.

06:06.844 --> 06:08.324
- Best way to get access
to Reed.

06:08.368 --> 06:09.673
- Hill's real loyal too.

06:09.717 --> 06:11.371
Thinks Reed is some kind
of visionary.

06:11.414 --> 06:13.024
That's why I killed the bust.

06:13.068 --> 06:14.765
No way that Hill flips.

06:14.809 --> 06:16.376
- All right, so how do we
get Reed to the table, then?

06:16.419 --> 06:18.203
- Increase the size
of the purchase.

06:18.247 --> 06:19.640
- Hmm.

06:19.683 --> 06:21.032
- If it's a big enough deal,
Reed will wanna be there.

06:21.076 --> 06:22.512
- Okay, good, then we have
Atwater go back there

06:22.556 --> 06:24.296
with a bigger,
better order, right?

06:24.340 --> 06:26.081
Say 50 weapons
instead of five.

06:26.124 --> 06:27.822
- All right.
Gear up.

06:28.953 --> 06:30.390
Hey, hey, you got a...

06:30.433 --> 06:31.782
- Hey, Kevin.

06:31.826 --> 06:34.002
- What's up?

06:34.045 --> 06:36.613
- Just want to, uh, clear
the air about that meet.

06:36.657 --> 06:38.528
- You were doing your job.
I get it.

06:40.051 --> 06:41.401
- I was in character.

06:41.444 --> 06:42.402
These guys,
they're real racists.

06:42.445 --> 06:44.360
I just had to play along.

06:44.404 --> 06:45.840
- Must've been hard.

06:46.536 --> 06:48.538
- Come on, man.

06:48.582 --> 06:50.845
Let's put that behind us, okay?

06:50.888 --> 06:53.543
You and me,
let's focus on locking up Reed.

06:55.327 --> 06:56.851
I come in peace.

06:56.894 --> 06:58.766
I just wanna make
a good bust here.

07:01.508 --> 07:02.900
- Okay.

07:05.076 --> 07:07.252
- I'll let you know
when I get a bite.

07:07.296 --> 07:08.863
- Yeah.

07:15.957 --> 07:18.220
- How does it feel?
- Like you're making my day.

07:18.263 --> 07:19.482
What we talking?

07:19.526 --> 07:21.266
- If you got for 50,
I'll cut you a deal.

07:21.310 --> 07:23.094
$1,500 apiece.

07:25.227 --> 07:26.663
Sure you can cover that?

07:26.707 --> 07:29.623
- You tell me.

07:29.666 --> 07:31.015
- How's that look?

07:31.059 --> 07:33.453
- Real good.

07:35.106 --> 07:37.021
- Why do you need
all these guns?

07:37.065 --> 07:38.501
- There's a war on the way
to the South Side.

07:38.545 --> 07:39.937
Everybody's strapping up.

07:39.981 --> 07:42.549
- So much for protecting
your fellow black man, huh?

07:42.592 --> 07:44.115
- Excuse me?

07:44.159 --> 07:46.727
- You sell these guns to
blacks, they kill more blacks.

07:46.770 --> 07:49.469
You don't got a problem
with it, I sure as hell don't.

07:51.035 --> 07:53.211
- Just business.

07:54.561 --> 07:56.998
- Okay.
I'll set up a meeting.

07:58.521 --> 08:01.132
I'll call my man right now.

08:01.176 --> 08:03.483
What the hell's a helicopter
doing circling out here?

08:05.006 --> 08:06.050
- Hey, relax.

08:06.094 --> 08:07.661
Sounds like it's going away,
all right?

08:07.704 --> 08:10.141
- Sounds like it's circling
back around.

08:10.185 --> 08:11.491
I don't like it.

08:11.534 --> 08:13.797
What the hell's going on?

08:13.841 --> 08:15.669
- Maybe they're friends
of yours.

08:15.712 --> 08:17.148
- What the hell does that mean?

08:18.323 --> 08:19.586
- Are you a cop?

08:19.629 --> 08:21.152
- Let's everybody
just calm down, all right?

08:21.196 --> 08:23.503
- Something ain't right here.
You a cop?

08:23.546 --> 08:24.721
Huh?
- Let's go.

08:28.551 --> 08:30.161
That what this is?

08:30.205 --> 08:33.774
- Hey, let's just take it easy,
all right, J?

08:33.817 --> 08:35.515
- Hey, hands up!

08:35.558 --> 08:36.559
- Stay down, stay down.
- Don't shoot, don't shoot!

08:36.603 --> 08:37.691
- Keep your hands up!

08:39.867 --> 08:42.609
- You were right.
We are the police.

08:42.652 --> 08:44.001
- Kev, you guys all right?
- We all good.

08:44.045 --> 08:45.437
- Yeah.
- You got him?

08:45.481 --> 08:46.743
- Yeah.

08:49.529 --> 08:50.747
- Nice work.

08:53.794 --> 08:55.709
- Good looking out.
- Yeah, sure thing.

09:02.454 --> 09:04.065
- You get anything from Hill?

09:04.108 --> 09:05.675
- Not a damn thing.
- Huh.

09:05.719 --> 09:07.677
- He's a true believer
in that racist punk Tony Reed.

09:07.721 --> 09:09.157
- Hold on.

09:09.200 --> 09:10.680
This is the burner phone
we took off of Hill.

09:10.724 --> 09:13.465
It's blowing up right now with
text messages from a Blue88.

09:13.509 --> 09:15.511
- Yeah, that's, uh,
Reed's code name.

09:15.555 --> 09:16.643
- Huh.

09:16.686 --> 09:17.644
- It looks like Reed's
hot and heavy

09:17.687 --> 09:18.993
to do this big sale
with Atwater.

09:19.036 --> 09:20.298
- You got a relationship
with Reed?

09:20.342 --> 09:22.039
- Yeah, he likes me.

09:22.605 --> 09:24.433
- I want you to text him back.
Pretend to be Hill.

09:24.476 --> 09:27.175
Tell him you've vetted Atwater,
the deal's on,

09:27.218 --> 09:30.178
only you can't make it,
you know, family emergency.

09:30.221 --> 09:31.658
What's your cover name?
- McDonald.

09:31.701 --> 09:33.573
- Yeah, suggest McDonald
go in his place.

09:33.616 --> 09:35.313
You cool with that?
- Yeah.

09:35.357 --> 09:37.098
- All right, start texting.
See if he takes the bait.

09:46.281 --> 09:48.500
Atwater's heading
toward the entrance.

09:48.544 --> 09:49.806
- Copy that.
I have eyes on him.

09:49.850 --> 09:51.416
- I assume
that's one of Reed's boys.

09:51.460 --> 09:52.679
- And we've got a good feed.

09:52.722 --> 09:54.419
- Why, 'cause he's white
and tatted up?

09:54.463 --> 09:57.553
Maybe he's an honor student
waiting for the bus.

09:57.597 --> 10:00.861
Don't judge a book
by its cover, man.

10:00.904 --> 10:02.123
'Sup, Scorpio?

10:02.166 --> 10:05.126
Big man inside?
- Been here 15 minutes.

10:13.961 --> 10:15.527
Sorry to keep you waiting.

10:15.571 --> 10:18.052
Here's the guy
we been talking about.

10:18.095 --> 10:19.314
Came ready to play.

10:19.357 --> 10:21.838
- Let's see it.

10:21.882 --> 10:23.144
- I counted it.

10:23.187 --> 10:25.537
It's good.

10:25.581 --> 10:27.714
- And I threw in an extra G
in good faith

10:27.757 --> 10:29.977
that you deliver quality,
this won't be the last time.

10:30.020 --> 10:32.762
- I'm always looking
for reliable business partners.

10:40.291 --> 10:42.032
- Here's a Christmas present.

10:42.076 --> 10:43.468
- Next time, I'll wrap them
for you.

10:43.512 --> 10:45.209
- Only if you use the paper
with the candy canes.

10:45.253 --> 10:46.558
That's my favorite.

10:46.602 --> 10:47.690
- Chicago PD!
- Don't move!

10:47.734 --> 10:49.170
- Get them up high!

10:49.213 --> 10:50.301
On the ground!
- Get your hands up!

10:50.345 --> 10:51.694
- Get down!
- Down on your knees.

10:51.738 --> 10:53.478
- Down!

10:53.522 --> 10:55.176
- You're under arrest, Tony.

10:58.962 --> 11:00.137
It's all you.

11:02.923 --> 11:04.141
- Hey.

11:04.185 --> 11:06.143
Nice bust, man.
- Yeah, man, you too.

11:06.187 --> 11:08.929
- How 'bout a beer?
- Nah, I can't.

11:08.972 --> 11:10.104
I'ma call it an early night

11:10.147 --> 11:11.192
so I can get started
on this paperwork.

11:11.235 --> 11:13.411
- Come on.
We just made a nice pinch.

11:13.455 --> 11:15.413
- Nice work, boys.
- Yeah.

11:15.457 --> 11:17.851
Look, I don't wanna go there,
but I will if I have to.

11:17.894 --> 11:19.156
- What are you talking about?

11:19.200 --> 11:20.984
- Well, I pretty much saved
your life yesterday,

11:21.028 --> 11:22.290
so I figured
the least you could do

11:22.333 --> 11:23.639
is let me buy you
a stinking beer.

11:26.729 --> 11:28.644
Okay, let's do it.

11:33.780 --> 11:36.347
- This was my first
undercover case.

11:38.132 --> 11:39.394
- Congrats.

11:39.437 --> 11:40.569
You did good work.

11:40.612 --> 11:42.179
- Thanks, man.
You too.

11:44.529 --> 11:47.663
It's fun,
the whole undercover thing.

11:48.795 --> 11:50.579
You know, it's kinda like
being an actor.

11:50.622 --> 11:52.146
- Yeah.

11:52.189 --> 11:54.670
Except these bullets are real.

11:56.803 --> 11:58.500
Yeah.

11:58.543 --> 12:00.676
Hey, uh, so look...

12:02.634 --> 12:05.159
The thing that happened
last year

12:05.202 --> 12:06.726
with me and you...

12:08.205 --> 12:10.773
I just want to apologize.

12:10.817 --> 12:13.341
I, uh,
wish I handled that better.

12:13.384 --> 12:14.864
- Let's not do this.

12:14.908 --> 12:17.214
- Do what?
- Talk about last year.

12:17.258 --> 12:19.695
You did what you did.
Nothing can change that.

12:19.739 --> 12:21.523
- Yeah, no, I know,
but it's not as simple

12:21.566 --> 12:22.785
as you're trying
to make it here.

12:22.829 --> 12:24.134
- We ain't gonna do this.
You can pull over.

12:24.178 --> 12:25.483
Just let me out.
I'll call an Uber.

12:25.527 --> 12:27.311
- You serious?
- I'm dead serious. Pull over.

12:27.355 --> 12:29.357
- No, I'm not gonna
let you out here.

12:29.400 --> 12:30.837
Look around, man.
It's a war zone.

12:30.880 --> 12:32.273
- I'll be fine.

12:33.883 --> 12:35.972
- I'll drive you back
to the district, okay?

12:36.016 --> 12:38.061
And we don't have
to talk about last year

12:38.105 --> 12:39.497
or anything else,
for that matter.

12:39.541 --> 12:41.499
I'll just shut up
and be your damn chauffeur.

13:00.736 --> 13:02.564
You seeing what I'm seeing?

13:04.261 --> 13:06.394
- Talking about?
- That guy over there

13:06.437 --> 13:08.222
with the bag--
looks suspicious.

13:08.265 --> 13:10.267
- Why?
'Cause he's black?

13:10.311 --> 13:11.834
- Yeah.

13:11.878 --> 13:13.880
100 bucks says he heads
into that drug den over there.

13:13.923 --> 13:16.186
- Drug den? What the hell makes
you think that's a drug den?

13:16.230 --> 13:18.362
- Look around.
It is what it is.

13:18.406 --> 13:21.017
That is a brother
in a known gang zone,

13:21.061 --> 13:23.715
carrying a bag,
walking into a stash house.

13:23.759 --> 13:26.022
- Based off of what theory?

13:26.066 --> 13:28.024
- Pfft.
Statistics.

13:28.068 --> 13:30.287
- What the hell you doing?
- Being a cop.

13:33.769 --> 13:36.946
Yo, what's in the bag?
- Nothing.

13:36.990 --> 13:41.081
- Hey, I'm police.
I asked you a question.

13:41.124 --> 13:42.430
What's in the bag?

13:42.473 --> 13:44.301
- Doyle, get your dumb ass
back in the car.

13:44.345 --> 13:45.650
- I don't got nothing.
Yo, relax.

13:45.694 --> 13:47.000
I said I ain't got nothing.
- I am relaxed.

13:47.043 --> 13:48.523
You relax.
- Hey, man, keep it moving.

13:48.566 --> 13:49.872
- Quit walking.
Talk.

13:49.916 --> 13:51.221
- Doyle, let it go!

13:51.265 --> 13:52.788
- Like I said,
I ain't got nothing.

13:52.832 --> 13:54.268
- Hey, stop.
I asked you a question.

13:54.311 --> 13:55.269
- Why you sweatin'?

13:55.312 --> 13:56.226
- I wanna know
what's in the bag.

13:57.445 --> 13:58.881
Quit moving back!
- Get off me, man!

14:07.803 --> 14:09.239
- Hey!

14:12.155 --> 14:13.243
Doyle!

14:18.466 --> 14:20.598
Chicago PD!
Doyle, where are you?

14:20.642 --> 14:22.035
- Go, go.
5-0, 5-0.

14:32.915 --> 14:35.004
Hey, hey.

14:35.048 --> 14:37.180
It's all right.

14:37.224 --> 14:39.922
Hold on, hold on.

14:39.966 --> 14:44.361
10-1, this is Officer Atwater,
badge number 52784.

14:44.405 --> 14:46.146
I need an ambo to 8701 Grafton.

14:46.189 --> 14:49.540
And officer has been shot.
I repeat, an officer is down.

14:49.584 --> 14:50.628
I'm right here with you.

14:50.672 --> 14:51.542
I just need you to fight,
Doyle.

14:51.586 --> 14:52.587
I need you to fight.

14:52.630 --> 14:55.329
Okay?
You gonna be good.

14:55.372 --> 14:56.547
- Just focus on me.

14:56.591 --> 14:58.375
Focus on me, focus on me.
Just stay with me.

14:58.419 --> 15:00.508
Fight.
I need you to fight.

15:00.551 --> 15:02.640
I got you.
I got you.

15:02.684 --> 15:04.642
Stay right here.
Stay with me.

15:04.686 --> 15:06.470
Stay with me.
Stay with me.

15:10.170 --> 15:11.693
- Doyle got into it
with the guy over the bag.

15:11.736 --> 15:12.955
- Okay.

15:12.999 --> 15:15.349
- But the only thing
in the bag: sneakers.

15:15.392 --> 15:17.394
- Oh, God.

15:17.438 --> 15:19.135
- There's this heroin
right here.

15:19.179 --> 15:20.354
- So what are you saying?

15:20.397 --> 15:22.095
Did the drugs come
from the duffel or what?

15:22.138 --> 15:23.487
- I don't know.

15:23.531 --> 15:25.925
- Hey, I got briefed outside.
You okay?

15:25.968 --> 15:28.449
- I'm good.
Is Doyle gonna survive?

15:28.492 --> 15:29.929
- He's in surgery.

15:30.973 --> 15:32.844
- Here's what we know so far.

15:32.888 --> 15:33.976
We've got one offender down,
no ID,

15:34.020 --> 15:35.717
so we're labeling him
a John Doe.

15:35.760 --> 15:38.154
- Hey, Vanessa, did we find out
who owns this property?

15:38.198 --> 15:39.547
- Not yet,
but it was definitely

15:39.590 --> 15:40.983
being used as a stash house.

15:41.027 --> 15:42.854
I found a kilo
in the air-conditioning unit,

15:42.898 --> 15:44.639
there's heroin right there,

15:44.682 --> 15:46.641
and Gangster Prophet graffitied
all over the place.

15:46.684 --> 15:48.643
- All right, what about the
two guys who fled the scene?

15:48.686 --> 15:50.558
You get a look at them, Kev?
- No, not really.

15:50.601 --> 15:52.299
It was two males, black,
20s.

15:52.342 --> 15:53.778
- I got a witness,
gave the same description,

15:53.822 --> 15:55.258
saw them fleeing
in a blue sedan.

15:55.302 --> 15:57.260
It's probably a Ford.
Got partial plates.

15:57.304 --> 15:59.741
- All right, these guys shot
at the police, you hear me?

16:00.872 --> 16:02.744
I don't give a damn
what we gotta do.

16:11.796 --> 16:14.060
Doyle didn't make it.
He's dead.

16:23.069 --> 16:27.464
So we do whatever we gotta do
to find these guys.

16:27.508 --> 16:29.118
You understand me?

16:38.258 --> 16:40.303
- Detective Doyle
was talking to a male, black,

16:40.347 --> 16:42.479
right outside
this door right here.

16:42.523 --> 16:45.047
Seemed like a routine
stop and frisk.

16:45.091 --> 16:47.049
The offender ducked
into the building.

16:48.659 --> 16:50.792
Doyle ran inside.

16:50.835 --> 16:52.924
I jumped out the car,
heard gunshots.

16:52.968 --> 16:55.275
Entered the same door,

16:55.318 --> 16:57.451
engaged with two offenders,

16:57.494 --> 16:58.930
fired five shots.

16:58.974 --> 17:00.323
The offenders fled
out the back.

17:00.367 --> 17:03.065
I noticed Doyle bleeding out.

17:03.109 --> 17:05.459
Immediately rendered aid
and called a 10-1.

17:06.242 --> 17:08.897
- That's good enough for now.
I'll be in touch.

17:18.298 --> 17:21.910
Guy came so close to being
the next mayor of Chicago.

17:21.953 --> 17:23.390
- Trudy, what are you
doing here?

17:23.433 --> 17:25.914
- I came to give you
a ride home.

17:25.957 --> 17:27.394
- Thanks.

17:27.437 --> 17:29.831
- You're welcome.
What's up?

17:30.397 --> 17:31.833
- People are getting together

17:31.876 --> 17:33.704
at Doyle's father's place
right now.

17:33.748 --> 17:35.271
- Yeah, that's a hard one.

17:35.315 --> 17:37.056
But you should
probably go, huh?

17:38.318 --> 17:40.102
I'll go with you if you want.

17:40.146 --> 17:42.626
- Please.
- Come on.

17:49.720 --> 17:51.200
- Thanks for coming by.

17:51.244 --> 17:53.681
- I did everything I could.

17:54.464 --> 17:57.641
- Thanks for coming, Trudy.
- Yeah, anything I can do.

17:57.685 --> 17:59.730
- I just wanna thank everyone
for coming by

17:59.774 --> 18:01.602
to pay your respects.

18:01.645 --> 18:05.475
We got, uh, lots of beer,
cold cuts, and pizza over here,

18:05.519 --> 18:07.651
so eat up,

18:07.695 --> 18:10.393
have a few drinks,
and every now and then,

18:10.437 --> 18:12.526
raise a glass to Tommy Doyle.

18:12.569 --> 18:15.833
He loved being blue.

18:15.877 --> 18:20.490
He loved being a Chicago cop.

18:20.534 --> 18:25.147
And that feeling of brotherhood
and love that we all share...

18:25.191 --> 18:28.237
That meant everything to him.

18:28.281 --> 18:31.371
To Tommy.
all: To Tommy.

18:31.414 --> 18:32.850
May he rest in peace.

18:39.770 --> 18:42.121
Thanks, Jim.

18:42.164 --> 18:44.514
Appreciate you coming by.

18:44.558 --> 18:47.735
The father's right over there.
Can you say a few words?

18:47.778 --> 18:49.128
Thank you.

18:52.218 --> 18:54.698
- Mr. Doyle.

18:54.742 --> 18:56.265
Kevin Atwater.

19:04.447 --> 19:07.276
Appreciate you
coming by, Kevin.

19:07.320 --> 19:09.104
It's a good Irish name.

19:09.148 --> 19:11.585
- Yeah, I'm proud of it.

19:12.803 --> 19:16.546
- Look, I heard--I heard
what happened in there.

19:16.590 --> 19:19.288
I know you tried
to help my boy.

19:19.332 --> 19:21.595
Thank you.
That means a lot.

19:24.728 --> 19:28.384
Only silver lining is,
he went out a hero.

19:28.428 --> 19:31.344
His name will be
memorialized on the wall.

19:31.387 --> 19:34.912
Not many people
get to say that.

19:39.961 --> 19:41.092
- Detective Thomas Doyle...

19:41.136 --> 19:42.268
- All right, I want updates.

19:42.311 --> 19:44.139
We get a hit
on this blue sedan?

19:44.183 --> 19:46.097
- No, but we're still
working on it.

19:46.141 --> 19:47.403
- Well, let's work harder.

19:47.447 --> 19:49.492
We got two cop killers
in the wind.

19:49.536 --> 19:51.668
-  I got an ID
on the John Doe offender.

19:51.712 --> 19:54.715
- Okay.
- His name is, uh, Shawn Page.

19:54.758 --> 19:56.282
Married, no priors.

19:56.325 --> 19:57.848
I also confirmed that
the bullets that killed Page

19:57.892 --> 19:59.546
were fired from Doyle's gun.

19:59.589 --> 20:01.025
- All right,
so talk to Page's family,

20:01.069 --> 20:03.114
see if they know anything
about the other two offenders.

20:03.158 --> 20:05.073
- Okay, boss, that, um...

20:05.116 --> 20:06.422
you know,
might be a little tricky.

20:06.466 --> 20:08.207
Her husband was
just shot to death.

20:08.250 --> 20:10.470
- So was
a Chicago police officer.

20:10.513 --> 20:12.950
I don't really care
if it's tricky.

20:12.994 --> 20:14.909
Just get me some answers.

20:14.952 --> 20:16.998
- Copy.

20:24.353 --> 20:26.747
Ma'am, I'm Officer Ruzek.

20:26.790 --> 20:28.183
This is Officer Atwater.

20:28.227 --> 20:30.707
We'd like to ask you
a few questions.

20:30.751 --> 20:32.492
- Excuse me?

20:32.535 --> 20:35.364
- About your husband, ma'am.

20:35.408 --> 20:38.976
- My husband's dead
'cause y'all shot his ass.

20:39.020 --> 20:42.850
So I ain't gonna be answering
any questions.

20:42.893 --> 20:47.202
- We understand how difficult
this has to be, Mrs. Page.

20:52.207 --> 20:53.556
- Please.

20:55.036 --> 20:58.387
- Amir, go with Auntie.

20:58.431 --> 21:01.434
Mama has to talk to the police.

21:07.353 --> 21:09.877
That little boy's daddy
is dead.

21:09.920 --> 21:12.836
- We're very sorry for that.

21:12.880 --> 21:15.186
But right now,
we have to find the two men

21:15.230 --> 21:17.928
that your husband
went to visit.

21:17.972 --> 21:19.234
We believe they shot
and killed

21:19.278 --> 21:21.323
a Chicago police officer.

21:21.367 --> 21:25.414
- You acting like it's just
another day at the damn office,

21:25.458 --> 21:28.330
like somehow my husband
deserved what he got.

21:28.374 --> 21:30.332
- No.
We're not saying that.

21:30.376 --> 21:31.594
- The hell you not!

21:31.638 --> 21:33.030
You come over to my house

21:33.074 --> 21:36.469
the day after my husband
got shot for no damn reason,

21:36.512 --> 21:39.298
and you want me to help you?

21:40.777 --> 21:42.518
- Ma'am, believe me,

21:42.562 --> 21:44.477
this is the hardest part
of the job.

21:44.520 --> 21:46.783
- Your damn job
cost my husband his life.

21:46.827 --> 21:48.350
And for what?

21:48.394 --> 21:49.743
He was going
to visit his cousin,

21:49.786 --> 21:52.049
just going to drop off
a pair of Air Jordans

21:52.093 --> 21:54.965
for his birthday.

21:55.009 --> 21:58.055
I saw that press conference.

21:58.099 --> 22:01.102
That bitch acted like Shawn
was a criminal.

22:01.145 --> 22:05.976
Just another young brother who
got mixed up with drugs, right?

22:06.020 --> 22:08.805
Well, that's a damn lie.

22:08.849 --> 22:11.417
Shawn...

22:11.460 --> 22:14.681
was a good man,
a good father.

22:14.724 --> 22:17.379
And he wasn't
no damn gangbanger,

22:17.423 --> 22:20.687
so please...

22:20.730 --> 22:22.384
can you get the hell out?

22:22.428 --> 22:25.169
Let me and my family grieve
in peace, please.

22:25.213 --> 22:26.388
- Ma'am.

22:26.432 --> 22:27.955
- Please!

22:27.998 --> 22:31.088
Get the hell out!
Get out!

22:42.099 --> 22:44.014
- Kev, I got something.
- Hmm?

22:44.058 --> 22:45.233
- Sarge, we got a hit
on the blue sedan.

22:45.276 --> 22:46.843
Patrol saw it pulling
into a house in Englewood.

22:46.887 --> 22:48.062
Both the house and the car

22:48.105 --> 22:49.368
are registered to this guy,
Jamal Pierce.

22:49.411 --> 22:51.239
- This guy got a sheet?
- No, he's clean.

22:51.282 --> 22:52.675
No gang ties,
but the house is in the middle

22:52.719 --> 22:54.242
of a Gangster Prophet
stronghold.

22:54.285 --> 22:55.417
Is this one of the guys
from the shoot-out?

22:55.461 --> 22:57.027
- Not sure.
It happened so fast.

22:57.071 --> 22:58.551
- Yeah, well, this could be
our cop killer.

22:58.594 --> 23:02.729
Get in touch with Nolan's crew.
Let's grab this guy now.

23:05.949 --> 23:07.081
All right, we just pulled in

23:07.124 --> 23:08.604
around the corner
from Jamal's place.

23:08.648 --> 23:10.127
Kev, where you at?

23:10.171 --> 23:12.739
- Outside of Jamal's place,
posted by the back alley.

23:12.782 --> 23:15.002
- Halstead?
- We're five minutes out.

23:15.045 --> 23:17.570
- All right, we wait
till everyone's in position.

23:17.613 --> 23:18.832
- Copy that.

23:24.533 --> 23:26.056
- That's him.

23:26.100 --> 23:28.319
- We got eyes on the offender.
West alley, moving in.

23:29.364 --> 23:31.192
Jamal Pierce,
Chicago PD.

23:31.235 --> 23:33.934
- Stop right there!
- Uh!

23:33.977 --> 23:36.110
- Where you going, Jamal?
Huh?

23:36.153 --> 23:37.241
- Dude, I ain't do nothing!
- You gotta relax.

23:37.285 --> 23:39.505
We still gotta
get in the house.

23:39.548 --> 23:41.507
- Let's go.

23:41.550 --> 23:43.900
Move.
Walk.

23:43.944 --> 23:45.815
Look at me.

23:45.859 --> 23:46.990
You shoot a cop last night?

23:47.034 --> 23:48.601
- What the hell
are you talking about?

23:48.644 --> 23:49.776
- You hang out at that building
over on Grafton Street?

23:49.819 --> 23:51.865
- No, man!
- Stop lying!

23:51.908 --> 23:54.258
- Hey.

23:54.302 --> 23:55.782
- You shot my partner.
I'd start talking.

23:55.825 --> 23:57.087
- Look, I ain't shoot nobody!

23:57.131 --> 23:58.262
- That's enough!

23:58.306 --> 24:00.221
- Do not tell me how to police!

24:01.309 --> 24:02.397
Sergeant.

24:02.441 --> 24:04.268
Offender disobeyed an order.
Fled.

24:04.312 --> 24:06.227
- 'Cause I ain't do nothing!

24:06.270 --> 24:08.229
- Shut up.

24:08.272 --> 24:10.013
A Chicago police officer
was just murdered.

24:10.057 --> 24:11.537
Your car was at the scene.

24:11.580 --> 24:14.801
You better give me an alibi
real fast, you understand me?

24:14.844 --> 24:17.194
Now, where were you last night
around 7:00?

24:17.238 --> 24:19.153
- I was at my uncle's house.
It was his birthday.

24:19.196 --> 24:20.241
- Hmm.

24:20.284 --> 24:21.416
- Look, I got pictures
on my phone!

24:21.460 --> 24:22.678
- Then give me.

24:22.722 --> 24:26.160
Give me!

24:26.203 --> 24:28.467
I was there from 6:30
till past midnight.

24:28.510 --> 24:31.165
- What's the passcode?
- 2121.

24:31.208 --> 24:33.950
- Then who was driving
your car?

24:33.994 --> 24:36.170
- Look, I don't know!
- You don't know?

24:36.213 --> 24:37.780
- Bad time to get amnesia,
Jamal.

24:37.824 --> 24:39.173
You got three seconds, or I
will beat your ass to a pulp.

24:39.216 --> 24:41.175
- Jamal, this gauze over here,
who is that for?

24:43.743 --> 24:45.962
Huh?

24:46.006 --> 24:48.748
- All right, listen to me,
Jamal.

24:48.791 --> 24:51.011
You work with us,
we can help you.

24:51.054 --> 24:54.101
You let someone borrow
your car?

24:54.144 --> 24:56.538
Someone who got injured?

24:56.582 --> 24:58.453
- Yeah.

24:58.497 --> 25:00.368
- Okay, good.
Who?

25:00.411 --> 25:02.892
- My friend Terrence.
- Okay.

25:02.936 --> 25:04.938
Is Terrence in your house
right now?

25:04.981 --> 25:07.157
- Yeah.

25:07.201 --> 25:08.811
He's in my basement
with some other dude.

25:08.855 --> 25:10.552
- All right, listen to me.

25:10.596 --> 25:12.380
You did the right thing.

25:13.903 --> 25:16.427
All right, give me the keys.

25:38.319 --> 25:39.842
- Clear.

25:51.158 --> 25:52.463
- Hey!
Don't even think about it.

25:52.507 --> 25:53.726
Get your ass down.
- Up!

25:53.769 --> 25:54.814
- Down!
- On the ground.

25:54.857 --> 25:56.293
- Up!

25:56.337 --> 25:57.381
- What are you looking at?

25:57.425 --> 25:59.427
Put your hands
behind your back.

26:02.038 --> 26:03.474
Come on, man!

26:03.518 --> 26:04.954
Watch my arm!

26:05.781 --> 26:07.217
- Ain't the body part
you need to be worrying about

26:07.261 --> 26:08.654
where you're going.

26:14.050 --> 26:16.618
At least we got the guys
who shot Doyle.

26:16.662 --> 26:19.099
Ain't much, but it's something.
- We're arresting Jamal?

26:19.142 --> 26:21.318
- Damn right, we are.

26:21.362 --> 26:22.755
Son of a bitch was harboring
two cop killers,

26:22.798 --> 26:23.799
buying them bandages.

26:23.843 --> 26:24.931
He's gotta do time for that.

26:24.974 --> 26:26.280
- He also gave us his friends.

26:26.323 --> 26:27.542
I think we need to take that
into consideration.

26:27.586 --> 26:28.761
- You seem to have
a lot of issues

26:28.804 --> 26:29.936
with the way I do my job.

26:29.979 --> 26:31.024
- No, I got issues with the way

26:31.067 --> 26:32.242
you put your hands on people.

26:32.286 --> 26:33.417
- I thought he killed
my partner.

26:33.461 --> 26:34.767
Truth is,
if you were a better cop,

26:34.810 --> 26:35.985
none of this
would've happened.

26:36.029 --> 26:37.378
Doyle would still be here.

26:37.421 --> 26:38.988
- Doyle is dead
because of Doyle!

26:39.032 --> 26:41.382
He did it to himself 'cause
he's a racist son of a bitch!

26:41.425 --> 26:42.557
- Don't disrespect my partner!

26:43.689 --> 26:44.777
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey.

26:44.820 --> 26:46.169
Bro, take a walk, huh?

26:50.783 --> 26:52.567
Jeez.

26:57.964 --> 26:59.966
You okay?
- I'm nowhere close to okay.

27:05.101 --> 27:06.668
- Listen to me, Terrence.

27:06.712 --> 27:09.279
We went through
your friend's car.

27:09.323 --> 27:12.979
We found the murder weapon,
shell casings,

27:13.022 --> 27:15.721
and plenty of blood.

27:15.764 --> 27:17.679
I think we both know

27:17.723 --> 27:20.900
that the blood DNA's
gonna come back to you.

27:20.943 --> 27:22.728
- Damn straight, it will,

27:22.771 --> 27:24.294
'cause that prick shot me.

27:24.338 --> 27:27.036
- So you admit you shot
Detective Doyle?

27:27.080 --> 27:29.909
- Hell yeah!
We wasn't doing nothing.

27:29.952 --> 27:31.824
- Man, we were just minding
our own business,

27:31.867 --> 27:34.217
playing "Fortnite."

27:34.261 --> 27:37.525
Maybe I was about
to do some partying.

27:37.568 --> 27:39.179
I know you found
my baggie of dope.

27:39.222 --> 27:40.789
Saying that--

27:40.833 --> 27:42.704
saying that to prove
I ain't hiding anything.

27:44.271 --> 27:47.187
And this white boy
came to the door,

27:47.230 --> 27:49.450
beating my guy Shawn,

27:49.493 --> 27:52.366
talking about he'll shoot
all our monkey asses.

27:52.409 --> 27:54.847
Dude pulled a gun,
started waving it.

27:54.890 --> 27:56.196
- Hold up.
No.

27:56.239 --> 27:57.937
You're saying
he pulled his gun first?

27:57.980 --> 28:00.417
- Yes.

28:00.461 --> 28:02.768
- So I reached for my gun.

28:02.811 --> 28:04.030
Then all hell broke loose.

28:04.073 --> 28:06.554
- So you're saying
the police shot first?

28:06.597 --> 28:08.991
- I ain't saying.
That's exactly what happened.

28:09.035 --> 28:10.558
- Uh-huh.

28:10.601 --> 28:12.168
- Shawn was just dropping off
a pair of new sneakers.

28:12.212 --> 28:13.996
- Huh.
- He ain't even in a gang.

28:14.040 --> 28:17.217
Not even a little.
Telling y'all...

28:17.260 --> 28:18.914
we was just
protecting ourselves.

28:18.958 --> 28:21.308
- Self-defense?
Really?

28:21.351 --> 28:24.746
That ain't gonna fly,
trust me.

28:24.790 --> 28:28.489
You and your buddy were sitting
on a couple of kilos of dope

28:28.532 --> 28:30.360
when a Chicago police officer

28:30.404 --> 28:32.232
entered the premises
to investigate,

28:32.275 --> 28:34.321
and you two open fire.

28:34.364 --> 28:35.931
That's the way it happened!

28:35.975 --> 28:37.193
And I'm telling you,

28:37.237 --> 28:40.240
that's the way
the jury's gonna see it too.

28:40.283 --> 28:42.242
- You can say
whatever you want,

28:42.285 --> 28:43.939
but that ain't even close
to how it went down.

28:43.983 --> 28:45.419
- Man, you don't know
what went down.

28:45.462 --> 28:47.682
I'm about to tell
you what's gonna go down.

28:49.292 --> 28:51.425
- Reconsider.

28:51.468 --> 28:53.775
- Sarge, Sarge, Sarge.
Let me talk to you.

29:04.307 --> 29:05.787
- This better be good.

29:05.831 --> 29:07.920
- No, you're not about to like
what I'm finna say.

29:07.963 --> 29:09.443
I think they're telling
the truth.

29:09.486 --> 29:11.532
- The hell are you
talking about?

29:11.575 --> 29:15.928
- I'm telling you what
I should've told you earlier.

29:15.971 --> 29:18.669
There was no probable cause.

29:19.932 --> 29:22.369
Doyle saw a black man
walking down the street

29:22.412 --> 29:24.458
and started profiling.

29:24.501 --> 29:27.722
- And that man was Shawn Page?

29:27.766 --> 29:29.245
- Wasn't doing
anything suspicious.

29:29.289 --> 29:31.639
He was just a black man
in a bad neighborhood

29:31.682 --> 29:34.381
holding a duffel bag, and
Doyle started following him.

29:34.424 --> 29:38.167
Eyeballed him, hopped out
of the car, jammed him up.

29:38.211 --> 29:39.647
And that's when everything
popped off.

29:39.690 --> 29:41.692
- Kevin.

29:41.736 --> 29:42.693
Listen to me.

29:44.826 --> 29:46.785
If what you're saying
is true...

29:49.526 --> 29:51.964
We got a big problem.

29:55.315 --> 29:56.403
- It's true.

30:00.973 --> 30:04.846
And now that I know that Page
wasn't even in the gang...

30:04.890 --> 30:06.282
he was just a regular dude

30:06.326 --> 30:08.154
that was dropping off a pair
of Jordans to his cousin.

30:08.197 --> 30:10.373
This is bad.

30:13.420 --> 30:14.943
Gotta say something.

30:16.292 --> 30:18.164
I can't just sit on this.

30:18.207 --> 30:19.905
I gotta say something.

30:33.875 --> 30:35.398
- Thanks for meeting me.

30:35.442 --> 30:38.010
- What's going on?

30:38.053 --> 30:40.795
I'm starting to hear things.

30:40.839 --> 30:42.710
- What kinda things?

30:42.753 --> 30:45.495
- Your guy Atwater.
- Uh-huh.

30:45.539 --> 30:48.063
-  Word is, he might be
looking to stir up trouble,

30:48.107 --> 30:52.546
make a stink about how Doyle's
shooting went down.

30:52.589 --> 30:54.156
- I don't know nothing
about that.

30:54.200 --> 30:55.854
- Well, whether you do
or you don't,

30:55.897 --> 30:58.682
I'm here to tell you
it's a bad idea.

30:58.726 --> 31:00.989
- Mm-hmm.

31:01.033 --> 31:03.905
- Atwater tries
to make this thing racial,

31:03.949 --> 31:07.866
tries to ruin the legacy
of a good, hardworking cop,

31:07.909 --> 31:09.302
a guy with lots of friends

31:09.345 --> 31:11.521
and family
in the rank and file,

31:11.565 --> 31:15.264
there will be repercussions.

31:15.308 --> 31:17.266
- Sounds like you're making
a threat, Kenny.

31:17.310 --> 31:18.615
- I'm just telling you
how it is.

31:18.659 --> 31:21.923
- No, let me tell you
how it is.

31:21.967 --> 31:24.926
Kevin Atwater's
like a son to me.

31:24.970 --> 31:28.277
You go after him,
you better come after me too.

31:38.157 --> 31:40.246
Hmm?

31:42.596 --> 31:44.076
Just got a call from COPA.

31:44.119 --> 31:45.468
They wanna--

31:45.512 --> 31:48.210
they wanna talk to you
this afternoon.

31:51.257 --> 31:52.823
Hmm?

31:57.524 --> 31:59.439
Thought about
how you wanna play it?

32:02.921 --> 32:04.444
- I'ma tell the truth.

32:06.446 --> 32:08.491
I can't stay silent.

32:08.535 --> 32:10.145
- Oh, I get that.

32:12.582 --> 32:15.107
I do, however...

32:17.109 --> 32:18.980
Want you to understand that...

32:20.721 --> 32:22.331
It's not that simple, Kevin.

32:22.375 --> 32:23.463
- Sarge--

32:23.506 --> 32:25.117
- No, bro,
I'm not giving you advice.

32:25.160 --> 32:28.294
I mean, you're the only one
who can make this decision.

32:28.337 --> 32:30.035
Okay?

32:30.078 --> 32:33.560
I just wanna
give you some facts,

32:33.603 --> 32:36.302
lay out certain realities...

32:38.478 --> 32:40.959
So you have all the information
to make that decision,

32:41.002 --> 32:42.482
you understand?

32:45.876 --> 32:49.619
Now, first of all,
you tell the truth...

32:49.663 --> 32:52.492
I mean, those two bangers
we grabbed, they're gonna walk.

32:55.190 --> 32:58.454
And Doyle's murder becomes
a justifiable homicide,

32:58.498 --> 33:01.631
and the drugs we seized,
they disappear too.

33:01.675 --> 33:03.677
Fruit of the poisonous tree.
- I get that.

33:03.720 --> 33:05.592
- Yo, Kev,

33:05.635 --> 33:09.204
like I told you,
I'm not here to debate you.

33:11.511 --> 33:13.208
Second:

33:13.252 --> 33:15.210
I mean,
if you tell the truth...

33:19.084 --> 33:23.044
You know, we're gonna
catch heat for Page's death.

33:23.088 --> 33:25.525
That becomes
a wrongful police shooting.

33:27.918 --> 33:29.181
I mean, you're staring down

33:29.224 --> 33:31.444
one hell of an Internal Affairs
investigation.

33:33.402 --> 33:37.015
And this city is going
to be sued for millions.

33:37.058 --> 33:38.886
Millions.

33:40.366 --> 33:45.110
And I honestly could give
a damn about any of that.

33:45.153 --> 33:47.547
That's problems we can handle,

33:47.590 --> 33:49.114
issues...

33:51.246 --> 33:52.508
Kevin.

33:55.076 --> 33:57.948
What I do care about,
what does concern me...

33:59.037 --> 34:01.387
Is Doyle's friends and family.

34:03.389 --> 34:05.304
Man, that kid
was third-generation police.

34:05.347 --> 34:07.175
He's got more uncles
and cousins on the force

34:07.219 --> 34:10.309
than anybody I ever heard of.

34:10.352 --> 34:12.746
And you're going after
his reputation,

34:12.789 --> 34:16.489
his--his character.

34:16.532 --> 34:19.622
I mean, you're gonna tarnish
his legacy.

34:21.320 --> 34:25.019
Believe me, those people
are gonna close ranks.

34:25.063 --> 34:27.543
Hard.
Fast.

34:36.465 --> 34:37.858
- I know.

34:46.519 --> 34:48.651
- Anyway,
you gotta ask yourself,

34:48.695 --> 34:52.133
I mean, really ask yourself...

34:54.266 --> 34:56.050
How bad do you wanna be right?

35:14.851 --> 35:16.462
- Yeah.
- All right.

35:16.505 --> 35:18.594
- Hey.

35:18.638 --> 35:20.770
Good to see you again, Ray.
- Thanks for stopping by.

35:20.814 --> 35:22.642
I don't get too many visitors.

35:22.685 --> 35:25.253
- Well, like I told you on the
phone, I'm looking for advice.

35:25.297 --> 35:27.212
Type of advice I feel only
somebody like you can give.

35:27.255 --> 35:30.432
Somebody like me?

35:30.476 --> 35:32.608
I'm not sure
what that means anymore.

35:32.652 --> 35:34.306
- That means a man.

35:34.349 --> 35:36.134
A black man
who's seen the world,

35:36.177 --> 35:37.657
knows how it works.

35:38.832 --> 35:41.182
Knows when to fight
and when to listen.

35:41.226 --> 35:43.924
- All right, so tell me
what's going on, Kevin.

35:43.967 --> 35:45.491
Tell me how I can help.

35:46.753 --> 35:49.059
It's like what MLK said,

35:49.103 --> 35:52.062
tragedy is not
the oppression and cruelty

35:52.106 --> 35:53.629
by the bad people.

35:53.673 --> 35:56.806
It's the silence over that
by the good people.

35:56.850 --> 35:59.157
- He's right.
It is.

35:59.200 --> 36:01.202
It is the silence,
the acceptance,

36:01.246 --> 36:02.856
and sometimes
you just gotta take a stand,

36:02.899 --> 36:04.292
no matter how risky it is,

36:04.336 --> 36:05.815
to let the chips fall
where they fall, right?

36:05.859 --> 36:07.556
- But you gotta be the right
person to do that.

36:07.600 --> 36:10.342
You gotta be strong
through and through.

36:11.386 --> 36:14.215
The God's honest truth is,

36:14.259 --> 36:17.740
being a hero,
being brave,

36:17.784 --> 36:19.525
it's hard.

36:21.353 --> 36:23.833
It don't pay the bills
or do much else.

36:25.487 --> 36:27.924
The only thing it does get you

36:27.968 --> 36:30.753
is peace of mind

36:30.797 --> 36:33.452
and the belief that
you've made a difference.

36:33.495 --> 36:35.454
And it's that belief,
that feeling,

36:35.497 --> 36:39.197
that has to be good enough,
because if you expect more...

36:39.240 --> 36:42.156
if you looking for praise
and high-fives,

36:42.200 --> 36:43.592
they ain't gonna be coming.

36:44.941 --> 36:47.335
And the hardest part?

36:47.379 --> 36:50.251
No matter how principled
you could be

36:50.295 --> 36:54.429
or how big the damn stand
you decide to take,

36:54.473 --> 36:57.780
the odds of something actually
changing for the better

36:57.824 --> 36:58.868
are close to zero.

37:06.267 --> 37:08.226
What are you saying, Ray?

37:09.270 --> 37:11.707
- I'm just talking
about reality.

37:11.751 --> 37:15.145
And the reality is, you ain't
no Martin Luther King.

37:22.109 --> 37:25.068
So what I'm saying,
youngblood...

37:28.028 --> 37:31.640
Only a fool would take on
what you're talking about.

37:33.990 --> 37:35.601
So if I was you...

37:37.342 --> 37:39.909
I'd keep my mouth shut,

37:39.953 --> 37:43.173
keep doing what I'm doing:

37:43.217 --> 37:45.741
policing
the way you police,

37:45.785 --> 37:48.918
looking out the way
you look out.

37:48.962 --> 37:51.094
And maybe, just maybe...

37:53.488 --> 37:56.186
That might be good enough.

38:00.974 --> 38:04.325
But I'm not you, am I?

38:23.692 --> 38:25.912
- Doyle and I
had just made an arrest.

38:28.175 --> 38:31.744
Big gun dealer named Tony Reed.

38:31.787 --> 38:33.311
We were feeling pretty good
about ourselves,

38:33.354 --> 38:34.877
so we decided to celebrate...

38:36.662 --> 38:37.924
Get a beer.

38:39.447 --> 38:41.057
On the way to the bar,

38:41.101 --> 38:44.322
Doyle noticed a male, black,
walking down the street.

38:46.498 --> 38:49.762
He was carrying a bag,
duffel bag.

39:04.167 --> 39:06.561
- There is
no right or wrong, Kev.

39:08.476 --> 39:10.739
You did what you had to do,

39:10.783 --> 39:12.219
what you felt was right.

39:14.134 --> 39:15.788
I mean,
I can't make any promises

39:15.831 --> 39:19.357
on how this is gonna play out,
but I'll tell you one thing.

39:19.400 --> 39:23.273
Adam and I
and all of Intelligence,

39:23.317 --> 39:26.581
bro, we got your back
no matter what.

39:28.104 --> 39:29.845
- That means a lot, Sarge.

39:33.980 --> 39:37.113
- Here's to having the guts
to tell the truth.

39:37.157 --> 39:39.855
To tell your truth.

39:42.118 --> 39:43.903
- Your truth.

40:14.716 --> 40:16.762
Hell no.

40:21.288 --> 40:22.768
Is this what we doing?

40:24.117 --> 40:25.553
You coming for me?

40:25.597 --> 40:28.469
If you coming for me,
then come on.

40:28.513 --> 40:31.254
Okay?
Just me and you.

40:31.298 --> 40:33.256
I ain't going nowhere.

40:38.305 --> 40:39.959
Where you going?

40:41.177 --> 40:43.092
I ain't going nowhere.

40:46.444 --> 40:49.272
So that's what it is?

40:49.316 --> 40:52.232
So that's what it is, huh?

40:52.275 --> 40:54.582
Well, come on!

40:54.626 --> 40:57.585
I know exactly what time it is!

40:57.629 --> 41:00.109
You think I'm going anywhere?
'Cause I'm not!

41:00.153 --> 41:02.721
Y'all got the right one!

41:02.764 --> 41:05.419
Y'all know exactly
where I'm at!

41:05.463 --> 41:08.901
I'm right here!
I'm right here!
