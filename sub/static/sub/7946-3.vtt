Look, guys, we'll get

07:51.981 --> 07:53.500
through this, okay?

07:53.542 --> 07:55.375
- We just, we have
- to stick together.

07:55.417 --> 07:57.439
Yes, we shall stick

07:57.440 --> 07:59.459
together like my cheek

07:55.417 --> 07:59.459
is stuck to this floor.

08:00.918 --> 08:02.209
Seriously, does Tony

08:02.210 --> 08:03.500
ever clean this place?

08:04.083 --> 08:06.000
Uh!

08:06.042 --> 08:07.313
Now, we just have to make

08:07.314 --> 08:08.584
some money to live on.

08:08.626 --> 08:10.584
But how?

08:10.626 --> 08:12.334
Well, lots of kids do

08:12.335 --> 08:14.042
little odd jobs to make money

08:10.626 --> 08:14.042
for their families.

08:14.083 --> 08:16.042
- So we just have
- to find those kids

08:16.083 --> 08:17.792
- And make 'em
- hand over that money!

08:19.417 --> 08:21.000
No!

08:21.042 --> 08:22.584
We're gonna earn it.

08:22.626 --> 08:23.834
I could ask for

08:23.835 --> 08:25.042
some extra hours

08:22.626 --> 08:25.042
at the Snack Shack.

08:25.083 --> 08:26.730
And maybe start treating

08:26.731 --> 08:28.375
the customers nicely,

08:25.083 --> 08:28.375
so I actually get tips.

08:29.083 --> 08:30.459
There's a novel idea.

08:31.584 --> 08:33.063
Meanwhile, let's get

08:33.063 --> 08:34.542
into our PJ's.

08:34.583 --> 08:35.583
Where?

08:37.082 --> 08:38.764
- Great question.
- Let's just go to sleep.

08:40.042 --> 08:41.458
- (LOCKING DOOR)
- Get tucked in...

08:42.125 --> 08:43.542
Goodnight, guys.

08:44.042 --> 08:45.500
(ALL SCREAMING)

08:49.834 --> 08:51.418
Bertram?

08:51.419 --> 08:53.000
How did you get in?

08:49.834 --> 08:53.000
I locked the door.

08:53.042 --> 08:54.667
- Yeah, I think
- it's still locked.

08:56.626 --> 08:58.125
- What are you
- doing here?

08:58.167 --> 09:00.059
- I thought Chesterfield - said you
could stay - In your old room.

09:00.083 --> 09:01.751
She did, but then she

09:01.752 --> 09:03.417
kept wanting to tuck me in.

09:03.459 --> 09:04.459
(ALL SHUDDERING)

09:05.500 --> 09:07.042
Can I stay with you guys?

09:07.083 --> 09:09.042
- Only if you can sleep
- on a toilet.

09:09.083 --> 09:10.542
Meh. I do it all the time,

09:10.543 --> 09:12.000
but I didn't bring

09:09.083 --> 09:12.000
any magazines.

09:12.042 --> 09:13.667
So get one of your

09:13.668 --> 09:15.292
boring ex-boyfriend

09:12.042 --> 09:15.292
stories ready.

09:19.375 --> 09:20.480
Hey, Emma, I thought

09:20.481 --> 09:21.584
I'd have my lunch

09:19.375 --> 09:21.584
break with you guys.

09:21.626 --> 09:23.189
What can I get for

09:23.190 --> 09:24.751
a dollar and 29 cents?

09:25.417 --> 09:26.626
This spork.

09:28.334 --> 09:29.481
No, thanks. I'm on

09:29.482 --> 09:30.626
a low plastic diet.

09:32.626 --> 09:34.043
So, how do you like

09:34.044 --> 09:35.459
being a handywoman?

09:35.500 --> 09:37.059
- Oh. Uh, well, you know
- that garbage chute

09:37.083 --> 09:38.313
That we used to love

09:38.314 --> 09:39.542
throwing gross stuff into?

09:39.584 --> 09:40.584
That leads to my office.

09:42.584 --> 09:44.542
Luke!

09:44.584 --> 09:46.001
You don't take the customers'

09:46.002 --> 09:47.417
plates until after

09:44.584 --> 09:47.417
they're finished eating.

09:47.459 --> 09:48.522
If I wait that long,

09:48.523 --> 09:49.584
the food will get cold.

09:51.083 --> 09:52.751
Hey, guys.

09:52.792 --> 09:54.251
To help out, I got a job

09:54.252 --> 09:55.709
as a bike messenger.

09:55.751 --> 09:57.459
- When did you learn
- to ride a bike?

09:57.500 --> 09:59.584
Oh, I didn't.

09:59.626 --> 10:02.026
- It took me three hours - to
walk this thing - Seven blocks.

10:03.542 --> 10:05.584
Everything must go,

10:05.626 --> 10:07.500
and no price is too low!

10:07.542 --> 10:09.772
So get out your wallets,

10:09.773 --> 10:12.000
and hand me that dough!

10:12.042 --> 10:13.709
Zuri, it's so nice to see you

10:13.710 --> 10:15.375
sacrificing for the family.

10:15.417 --> 10:17.584
Hey! Wait, this is mine!

10:17.626 --> 10:18.813
And these clothes

10:18.814 --> 10:20.000
are Luke's and Emma's!

10:20.042 --> 10:21.376
What was I gonna do,

10:21.377 --> 10:22.709
sell Ravi's clothes?

10:22.751 --> 10:24.917
Do you know what

10:24.918 --> 10:27.083
the resale is on used

10:22.751 --> 10:27.083
socks and sandals?

10:27.125 --> 10:28.542
Hey, Zuri, the point is,

10:28.543 --> 10:29.959
none of this belongs to you.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.560
- Aren't you giving up
- anything of your own?

10:31.584 --> 10:35.042
Yes, my afternoon!

10:35.083 --> 10:36.813
At least I'm bringing

10:36.814 --> 10:38.542
in more cash than

10:35.083 --> 10:38.542
some people.

10:38.584 --> 10:39.959
I won't name names.

10:42.709 --> 10:43.709
Hey!

10:45.584 --> 10:47.042
I put that in there!

10:49.751 --> 10:51.293
Okay, three brushes,

10:51.294 --> 10:52.834
a spit, then move

10:49.751 --> 10:52.834
along, people.

10:52.876 --> 10:54.667
- And wash a dish
- while you're at it.

10:55.751 --> 10:57.042
- Ravi, I need
- to make the bed.

10:57.083 --> 10:58.563
Uh, please, give me

10:58.564 --> 11:00.042
some privacy.

11:00.083 --> 11:02.042
- Why do you need
- privacy to floss?

11:02.083 --> 11:03.397
Afraid Luke's gonna take

11:03.398 --> 11:04.709
a picture of you for

11:02.083 --> 11:04.709
his next calendar?

11:05.876 --> 11:07.252
I never thought I would

11:07.253 --> 11:08.626
have to reveal this,

11:08.667 --> 11:09.918
but the truth is,

11:09.959 --> 11:12.500
I have shy gums!

11:12.542 --> 11:14.500
- I thought it was his
- bladder that was shy.

11:14.542 --> 11:16.375
- I thought it was...
- That's enough!

11:18.083 --> 11:20.063
Ravi, you and your

11:20.064 --> 11:22.042
socially awkward body parts

11:18.083 --> 11:22.042
need to move off the bed.

11:22.083 --> 11:23.792
There is no "off the bed."

11:23.793 --> 11:25.500
The whole room is bed!

11:25.542 --> 11:27.000
Hey, wait, where's Luke?

11:28.167 --> 11:29.959
Oh!

11:30.000 --> 11:31.959
- Hey, wake up!
- Time to go to school.

11:33.083 --> 11:34.959
Okay, but first I have

11:34.960 --> 11:36.834
to go to the bathroom.

11:36.876 --> 11:38.542
No, no, no, no, no.

11:38.584 --> 11:41.000
That is not happening.

11:41.042 --> 11:42.563
Use the bodega restroom

11:42.564 --> 11:44.083
like the rest of us.

11:44.125 --> 11:45.834
But they always make me

11:45.835 --> 11:47.542
buy chips first,

11:44.125 --> 11:47.542
and I'm in a hurry!

11:49.083 --> 11:50.355
Jessie, we can't

11:50.356 --> 11:51.626
live like this!

11:51.667 --> 11:52.667
Guys, it's like your

11:52.668 --> 11:53.668
parents told you,

11:53.709 --> 11:55.459
- they're trying to
- figure it out,

11:55.500 --> 11:56.584
But in the meantime,

11:56.585 --> 11:57.667
we have each other,

11:57.709 --> 11:59.459
and a roof over our heads.

12:02.083 --> 12:03.167
Part of a roof.

12:05.083 --> 12:07.000
Hello, Mrs. Polsky.

12:10.125 --> 12:11.667
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)

12:12.584 --> 12:14.042
Hurry up, Jimmy!

12:14.083 --> 12:15.126
How hard can it be

12:15.127 --> 12:16.167
to shimmy up a shaft?

12:17.751 --> 12:18.876
I'm trying

12:18.877 --> 12:20.000
to oil the cables,

12:20.042 --> 12:21.397
because you complained

12:21.398 --> 12:22.751
about an annoying noise.

12:22.792 --> 12:24.230
I was referring to you.

12:24.231 --> 12:25.667
(CHUCKLES)

12:25.709 --> 12:26.855
Do that later.

12:26.856 --> 12:28.000
I have a job for you.

12:29.083 --> 12:30.626
(CHUCKLES)

12:30.667 --> 12:31.959
Okay, I already told you,

12:31.960 --> 12:33.250
I'm not gonna whack

12:30.667 --> 12:33.250
anyone for you.

12:33.292 --> 12:35.042
I want you to

12:35.043 --> 12:36.792
destroy this wall.

12:36.834 --> 12:38.584
Start with the freckled one.

12:38.626 --> 12:39.813
His creepy little eyes

12:39.814 --> 12:41.000
follow me everywhere.

12:42.959 --> 12:44.876
Yeah, I know how you feel.

12:44.918 --> 12:46.918
Look, before I demolish

12:46.919 --> 12:48.918
the only home these

12:44.918 --> 12:48.918
children have ever known,

12:48.959 --> 12:50.935
- would you consider
- maybe letting them stay here?

12:50.959 --> 12:52.085
Just until their parents

12:52.086 --> 12:53.209
get this all sorted out?

12:53.250 --> 12:54.730
Mmm. Well, I certainly

12:54.731 --> 12:56.209
have the space...

12:56.250 --> 12:58.750
But I'd rather have a nose job

12:58.751 --> 13:01.250
on a roller coaster than

12:56.250 --> 13:01.250
share anything with you.

13:01.292 --> 13:02.917
Okay, I feel the need

13:02.918 --> 13:04.542
to point out I'm still

13:01.292 --> 13:04.542
holding a large mallet.

13:07.709 --> 13:09.001
So, I asked Mrs. Chesterfield

13:09.002 --> 13:10.292
if we could stay

13:07.709 --> 13:10.292
in our old penthouse.

13:10.334 --> 13:12.209
Did she say yes?

13:12.250 --> 13:13.585
Nope. Apparently,

13:13.586 --> 13:14.918
she would rather get

13:12.250 --> 13:14.918
plastic surgery from a carny.

13:16.209 --> 13:17.251
Hey, I finally made

13:17.252 --> 13:18.292
some cash.

13:18.334 --> 13:20.667
Someone actually tipped you?

13:20.709 --> 13:22.209
Nope. A lady gave me a dollar

13:22.210 --> 13:23.709
to stop burping and go away.

13:25.167 --> 13:27.000
- Years of smelling
- your salami burps,

13:27.042 --> 13:29.482
- And all I had to do - was hit you with
- A wadded up single?

13:31.667 --> 13:33.042
Hey, guys.

13:33.083 --> 13:35.042
- Hey, Zuri,
- how are sales?

13:35.083 --> 13:36.876
Well, the bad news is,

13:36.877 --> 13:38.667
no one wants your stuff.

13:38.709 --> 13:40.167
The other bad news is,

13:40.209 --> 13:41.605
apparently, you need a permit

13:41.606 --> 13:43.000
to sell things in the park.

13:43.042 --> 13:44.250
Wait.

13:44.292 --> 13:45.542
Zuri, this is

13:45.543 --> 13:46.792
a $700 ticket!

13:46.834 --> 13:48.001
Yeah, I may have

13:48.002 --> 13:49.167
mouthed off a little.

13:52.209 --> 13:53.418
Guys, we're going

13:53.419 --> 13:54.626
in the wrong direction.

13:54.667 --> 13:55.855
If it weren't for Luke's

13:55.856 --> 13:57.042
obnoxious burping,

13:54.667 --> 13:57.042
we'd have nothing.

13:57.083 --> 13:59.334
Ugh! This totes stinks!

13:59.375 --> 14:00.564
It seems like the only

14:00.565 --> 14:01.751
person happy about

13:59.375 --> 14:01.751
our situation

14:01.792 --> 14:03.417
is Mrs. Chesterfield.

14:03.459 --> 14:05.084
I can't believe how

14:05.085 --> 14:06.709
fast she swooped in

14:03.459 --> 14:06.709
and took our place.

14:06.751 --> 14:09.022
Yes, it is almost as if

14:09.023 --> 14:11.292
she had prior knowledge

14:06.751 --> 14:11.292
of our financial downfall.

14:11.334 --> 14:13.188
Wait, are you thinking

14:13.189 --> 14:15.042
what I am thinking?

14:15.083 --> 14:16.918
- You should switch
- hair conditioners?

14:17.959 --> 14:19.042
No!

14:19.083 --> 14:22.000
Well, you really should.

14:24.083 --> 14:25.376
Wait, Ravi, are you saying

14:25.377 --> 14:26.667
you think Mrs. Chesterfield

14:26.709 --> 14:27.709
had something to do

14:27.710 --> 14:28.709
with your parents losing

14:26.709 --> 14:28.709
all their money?

14:28.751 --> 14:29.751
It is possible.

14:29.752 --> 14:30.752
And if she is guilty,

14:30.792 --> 14:32.292
every criminal leaves clues,

14:32.334 --> 14:34.375
like incriminating e-mails.

14:34.417 --> 14:35.730
So, if we can just get

14:35.731 --> 14:37.042
our hands on her laptop,

14:37.083 --> 14:38.751
- we may be able
- to prove what she did.

14:38.792 --> 14:39.959
I'd love to see

14:39.960 --> 14:41.125
Chesterfield in prison.

14:41.167 --> 14:43.042
That's mean!

14:43.083 --> 14:44.126
What did those

14:44.127 --> 14:45.167
prisoners ever do to you?

14:47.000 --> 14:53.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:54.792 --> 14:56.418
Why does Mrs. Chesterfield

14:56.419 --> 14:58.042
have a net in the middle

14:54.792 --> 14:58.042
of the living room?

14:58.083 --> 15:00.404
- To catch her prey before she
- sucks the life out of 'em.

15:01.292 --> 15:02.501
Okay, let's split up

15:02.502 --> 15:03.709
and look for that laptop.

15:03.751 --> 15:05.375
- We need that
- evidence. Boys...

15:08.417 --> 15:10.334
- Where do you think
- she keeps her laptop?

15:10.375 --> 15:11.522
Probably in the coffin

15:11.523 --> 15:12.667
she sleeps in.

15:14.417 --> 15:16.042
- MRS. CHESTERFIELD:
- Oh, Zeusie.

15:16.083 --> 15:17.083
Run!

15:23.459 --> 15:24.834
(SNIFFS)

15:24.876 --> 15:26.751
Ugh!

15:26.792 --> 15:28.605
They've been gone a week

15:28.606 --> 15:30.417
and yet the scent of children

15:26.792 --> 15:30.417
still lingers.

15:30.459 --> 15:32.042
- I should have this
- place tented.

15:34.792 --> 15:35.918
Luke, did you find

15:35.919 --> 15:37.042
Mrs. Chesterfield's laptop?

15:37.083 --> 15:38.417
My room...

15:38.459 --> 15:40.209
She painted it pink.

15:40.250 --> 15:42.000
Everything pink.

15:42.459 --> 15:44.167
So girly...

15:46.125 --> 15:47.959
- Luke! We don't have
- time for this.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.647
Spit, scratch yourself,

15:49.648 --> 15:51.292
and snap out of it!

15:51.334 --> 15:53.730
That cobra in a feathered

15:53.731 --> 15:56.125
hat has turned my room

15:51.334 --> 15:56.125
into Zeus's play room!

15:56.167 --> 15:58.125
There's a bone shaped seesaw,

15:58.167 --> 15:59.980
and a giant chew toy

15:59.981 --> 16:01.792
that looks remarkably

15:58.167 --> 16:01.792
like you, Jessie.

16:01.834 --> 16:03.417
(CELL PHONE CHIMES)

16:03.459 --> 16:05.167
- It's a text from Emma.
- (GASPS)

16:05.209 --> 16:06.876
Mrs. Chesterfield is here!

16:06.918 --> 16:07.959
I thought I felt

16:07.960 --> 16:09.000
an evil chill. Let's go.

16:10.250 --> 16:11.351
- Luke, where are
- you going?

16:11.375 --> 16:13.083
- To get that chew toy.
- Oh, come on.

16:16.334 --> 16:17.876
Oh, Zeusie! Isn't this

16:17.877 --> 16:19.417
exhilarating? (GIGGLES)

16:19.459 --> 16:21.335
I haven't felt this alive

16:21.336 --> 16:23.209
since I found out my

16:19.459 --> 16:23.209
third husband was dead!

16:25.083 --> 16:26.459
(BARKING)

16:26.500 --> 16:27.938
Zeusie, stop barking

16:27.939 --> 16:29.375
and pay attention to Mommy.

16:29.417 --> 16:30.876
I have a new trick.

16:34.292 --> 16:35.584
Well, that's rude.

16:35.626 --> 16:36.918
When you learn a new trick,

16:36.919 --> 16:38.209
I give you a treat!

16:39.459 --> 16:41.042
ZURI: Scram, Zeus.

16:41.083 --> 16:42.417
Ah!

16:42.459 --> 16:43.459
I think that's

16:43.460 --> 16:44.460
enough for today.

16:44.500 --> 16:46.083
Trap-easy does it.

16:46.125 --> 16:47.459
(WHIMPERS)

16:47.500 --> 16:49.000
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)

(GASPS)

16:51.083 --> 16:52.438
Oh, my...

16:52.439 --> 16:53.792
Oh, my!

16:55.083 --> 16:56.393
- I have a package
- for you, Rhoda.

16:56.417 --> 16:58.334
Oh, where do I sign?

17:00.083 --> 17:01.959
- And what
- a delightful coincidence

17:02.042 --> 17:03.230
That you're the one

17:03.231 --> 17:04.416
delivering it to me.

17:04.459 --> 17:05.751
This is the tenth thing

17:05.752 --> 17:07.041
you've had me

17:04.459 --> 17:07.041
deliver to you.

17:07.083 --> 17:09.041
- And by the way,
- it was really fun

17:09.083 --> 17:10.313
Carrying that gigantic net

17:10.314 --> 17:11.541
on my bicycle.

17:11.584 --> 17:13.375
(CHUCKLES)

17:13.416 --> 17:14.980
Oh, it's my laptop.

17:14.981 --> 17:16.541
I was having it repaired.

17:16.584 --> 17:17.917
Grab that bag!

17:19.541 --> 17:20.500
Oh!

17:20.541 --> 17:22.291
Got her!

17:22.334 --> 17:24.534
- No, not that bag! - The one with the
- Computer in it!

17:25.166 --> 17:26.230
Oh, yeah.

17:26.231 --> 17:27.291
Honest mistake.

17:28.375 --> 17:29.584
Ack!

17:29.626 --> 17:30.813
What are you poorhouse

17:30.814 --> 17:32.000
ragamuffins doing here?

17:32.042 --> 17:33.584
- We're here for
- that computer.

17:33.626 --> 17:35.500
- Good gracious,
- there are more of them!

17:35.542 --> 17:38.500
Zeus, call the exterminator.

17:38.542 --> 17:40.834
We know you are responsible

17:40.835 --> 17:43.125
for Mr. Daddy and Mrs. Mommy

17:38.542 --> 17:43.125
losing their money.

17:43.167 --> 17:44.918
That is ridiculous.

17:44.959 --> 17:46.021
Fine, take my computer.

17:46.022 --> 17:47.083
I have nothing to hide.

17:47.125 --> 17:49.000
- That outfit
- says otherwise.

17:51.375 --> 17:53.417
What is your password?

17:53.459 --> 17:54.751
"Rhoda and Bertram

17:54.752 --> 17:56.042
sitting in a tree."

17:56.083 --> 18:00.042
P-U-K-I-N-G.

18:00.083 --> 18:02.063
Ravi, could you change

18:02.064 --> 18:04.042
that password while

18:00.083 --> 18:04.042
you're in there?

18:04.083 --> 18:06.000
- We know you've always
- wanted this penthouse.

18:06.042 --> 18:07.643
- So you finally did
- something about it.

18:07.667 --> 18:09.021
Oh, don't be silly.

18:09.022 --> 18:10.375
Ravi, hurry up!

18:10.417 --> 18:12.042
- I don't know what
- makes me angrier,

18:12.083 --> 18:13.313
That you got us

18:13.314 --> 18:14.542
thrown out of our apartment,

18:14.584 --> 18:15.834
or that you know

18:15.835 --> 18:17.083
his name and not mine.

18:17.125 --> 18:18.293
I just want you all

18:18.294 --> 18:19.459
out of here.

18:19.500 --> 18:20.918
If I wanted to look

18:20.919 --> 18:22.334
at poor kids,

18:19.500 --> 18:22.334
I'd go see Annie.

18:24.083 --> 18:25.688
I am afraid I have

18:25.689 --> 18:27.292
yet to find anything

18:24.083 --> 18:27.292
incriminating.

18:27.334 --> 18:28.876
But someone spends

18:28.877 --> 18:30.417
way too much time

18:27.334 --> 18:30.417
looking for cheap Botox.

18:31.626 --> 18:33.334
Just admit it,

18:33.375 --> 18:34.980
you did something

18:34.981 --> 18:36.584
to make our parents

18:33.375 --> 18:36.584
lose all their money.

18:36.626 --> 18:38.063
You're a bad lady.

18:38.064 --> 18:39.500
And a big poopy head!

18:40.125 --> 18:42.125
Language, Zippy!

18:44.167 --> 18:45.334
Look, I know we've

18:45.335 --> 18:46.500
never gotten along,

18:46.542 --> 18:48.021
but I swear, I had

18:48.022 --> 18:49.500
nothing to do with

18:46.542 --> 18:49.500
your misfortune.

18:49.542 --> 18:52.500
Please believe me.

18:52.542 --> 18:53.834
All right. You know what,

18:53.835 --> 18:55.125
Mrs. Chesterfield,

18:55.167 --> 18:56.542
I believe you.

18:56.584 --> 18:58.059
- But you can see why...
- Yes, of course.

18:58.083 --> 18:59.167
- Now get out.
- Well, okay.

19:02.542 --> 19:05.500
Order up!

19:05.542 --> 19:06.959
You know, working

19:06.960 --> 19:08.375
together as a family

19:05.542 --> 19:08.375
is kind of fun.

19:08.417 --> 19:09.793
Especially since I don't

19:09.794 --> 19:11.167
have to clean out

19:08.417 --> 19:11.167
the rat traps anymore.

19:11.209 --> 19:12.417
(CROAKING)

19:12.459 --> 19:14.292
- Way to pull
- your weight, Mrs. K.

19:16.083 --> 19:17.772
Yes, it certainly beats

19:17.773 --> 19:19.459
being a human robot.

19:19.500 --> 19:21.105
Some ruffians tried

19:21.106 --> 19:22.709
to strip me for parts.

19:22.751 --> 19:24.084
Guys! Great news!

19:24.085 --> 19:25.417
Your dad just called.

19:25.459 --> 19:27.059
- He said you got all
- of your money back.

19:27.083 --> 19:28.500
(ALL CHEERING)

19:28.542 --> 19:30.042
Wait, what happened?

19:30.083 --> 19:31.602
- Well, the government
- made a mistake.

19:31.626 --> 19:33.125
- They got the
- wrong Ross family.

19:33.167 --> 19:34.500
Stupid government!

19:34.542 --> 19:36.293
I blame congressional

19:36.294 --> 19:38.042
gridlock.

19:38.083 --> 19:39.792
Anyway, I want to tell you

19:39.793 --> 19:41.500
guys I am really proud of you.

19:41.542 --> 19:43.375
- You all chipped in,
- you worked hard...

19:43.417 --> 19:44.417
Ravi, you learned

19:44.418 --> 19:45.418
how to sleep in a sink.

19:45.459 --> 19:47.835
It was not so bad,

19:47.836 --> 19:50.209
once Luke stopped turning

19:45.459 --> 19:50.209
on the garbage disposal.

19:50.250 --> 19:51.647
And you all took care

19:51.648 --> 19:53.042
of each other while I was

19:50.250 --> 19:53.042
working as a handyman.

19:53.083 --> 19:54.167
By the way, don't take

19:54.168 --> 19:55.250
the elevator for a while.

19:56.626 --> 19:57.876
Thank you, Jessie,

19:57.877 --> 19:59.125
for being there for us.

19:59.167 --> 20:00.351
- Even though you
- weren't getting paid.

20:00.375 --> 20:01.772
Mmm. Of course,

20:01.773 --> 20:03.167
I love you kids.

20:03.209 --> 20:04.355
Besides, money

20:04.356 --> 20:05.500
isn't what's important.

20:05.542 --> 20:06.793
What's important is

20:06.794 --> 20:08.042
being there for each

20:05.542 --> 20:08.042
other as a family.

20:08.792 --> 20:10.334
Hey, there's Bertram!

20:10.375 --> 20:11.667
- Let's tell him
- the good news.

20:11.709 --> 20:12.876
And get him out of those

20:12.877 --> 20:14.042
bike shorts ASAP.

20:14.083 --> 20:16.417
Can't stop this thing!

20:16.459 --> 20:18.292
- Bertram, watch out for...
- (CRASHING)

20:18.334 --> 20:20.125
- (ALL GROANING)
- (MATERIAL TEARING)

20:20.167 --> 20:21.417
And the shorts ripped.

20:25.167 --> 20:26.480
Mrs. Chesterfield,

20:26.481 --> 20:27.792
you have to leave!

20:29.709 --> 20:30.855
Or at least put

20:30.856 --> 20:32.000
on some pants.

20:33.083 --> 20:34.709
No!

20:34.751 --> 20:35.917
I can't believe

20:35.918 --> 20:37.083
you're kicking me out

20:34.751 --> 20:37.083
of my beloved home.

20:37.125 --> 20:39.334
It's our home.

20:39.375 --> 20:40.459
And you shouldn't have

20:40.460 --> 20:41.542
sold your place before

20:39.375 --> 20:41.542
the deal closed on this one.

20:41.584 --> 20:43.106
Oh, well thanks for

20:43.107 --> 20:44.626
the Monday morning

20:41.584 --> 20:44.626
quarterbacking, Jazzy.

20:47.500 --> 20:50.000
Zeus, bite the mean people!

20:56.876 --> 20:59.542
Traitor!

20:59.584 --> 21:01.084
Won't you all please

21:01.085 --> 21:02.584
take pity on a poor

20:59.584 --> 21:02.584
twenty-something...

21:02.626 --> 21:04.417
- (BOTH CHUCKLE)
- Don't say it!

21:05.250 --> 21:07.542
With nowhere to go.

21:07.584 --> 21:09.584
- I'll tell you where to go...
- Zippy!

21:09.626 --> 21:11.459
- I was gonna say
- a hotel.

21:12.834 --> 21:14.231
Well, actually,

21:14.232 --> 21:15.626
I can't afford a hotel.

21:15.667 --> 21:17.647
Due to some stupid

21:17.648 --> 21:19.626
clerical error, all my

21:15.667 --> 21:19.626
assets have been frozen.

21:19.667 --> 21:21.417
Just like her face.

21:21.459 --> 21:22.584
(CHUCKLES)

21:23.876 --> 21:25.167
Um...

21:25.209 --> 21:26.438
Hey, Ravi, did you have

21:26.439 --> 21:27.667
anything to do with

21:27.709 --> 21:29.063
Mrs. Chesterfield's

21:29.064 --> 21:30.417
financial difficulties?

21:30.459 --> 21:31.417
Duh!

21:31.459 --> 21:32.459
When I was looking at

21:32.460 --> 21:33.460
her computer,

21:33.500 --> 21:34.500
I noticed some

21:34.501 --> 21:35.501
illegal deductions,

21:35.542 --> 21:36.564
and I alerted

21:36.565 --> 21:37.584
the authorities.

21:37.626 --> 21:39.313
When it comes

21:39.314 --> 21:41.000
to tattle tale-ing, I say,

21:37.626 --> 21:41.000
"Go big or go home!"

21:42.417 --> 21:45.250
Ravi, that is...

21:45.292 --> 21:46.292
Awesome!

21:48.250 --> 21:49.375
Aw!

21:49.417 --> 21:50.685
- Don't worry,
- Mrs. Chesterfield.

21:50.709 --> 21:52.314
I know a nice, cozy

21:52.315 --> 21:53.918
place you can stay.

21:53.959 --> 21:55.876
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

21:58.209 --> 22:00.292
I can't stay here.

22:00.334 --> 22:01.834
It's revolting,

22:01.835 --> 22:03.334
and you obviously

22:00.334 --> 22:03.334
have termites.

22:03.375 --> 22:04.792
- (SIREN WAILING)
- TONY: No, no.

22:04.834 --> 22:06.542
- Those are
- bullet holes.

22:08.834 --> 22:10.605
Mrs. Chesterfield, what

22:10.606 --> 22:12.375
do you say to Tony for lending

22:08.834 --> 22:12.375
you his apartment?

22:12.417 --> 22:13.417
Yuck!

22:14.918 --> 22:16.542
- All right.
- Sweet dreams.
