00:34.267 --> 00:36.367
(INAUDIBLE)

00:38.701 --> 00:41.500
(FAINTLY) Is it all right to kiss you?

00:43.801 --> 00:45.334
-Oh! I'm sorry. -Oh!

00:51.000 --> 00:52.634
(INAUDIBLE)

00:54.901 --> 00:56.868
Michael? Michael, um...

00:58.601 --> 00:59.767
Half an hour?

01:02.267 --> 01:04.367
Another day, another dollar.

01:04.968 --> 01:06.400
Oh, any mail?

01:10.667 --> 01:14.500
-That's your... That's an earring! -Whatever. Get over it.

01:14.567 --> 01:18.100
-How long have you had that? -Too long, baby!

01:18.167 --> 01:20.467
-It's bleeding. -Really stings.

01:20.534 --> 01:24.868
-Blimey! Is it an old one? -Yeah and I had to push really hard at the time and...

01:24.934 --> 01:28.734
-But they heal over. -It had healed over. So I think I opened a...

01:28.801 --> 01:30.000
-Oh. -Sore. Oh.

01:33.234 --> 01:37.167
-You know who's... What are you looking at? -I'm not looking at anything.

01:37.234 --> 01:40.667
Those people who came in, Ray and Jude? The ones who I had the meeting with?

01:40.734 --> 01:42.567
-I know. -Yeah. They do.

01:42.634 --> 01:44.834
-Well, you know they do sort of training seminars. -Yeah, um...

01:44.901 --> 01:47.033
Yeah, use expert speakers, don't they?

01:47.100 --> 01:50.667
-Yeah. -They're using me. So... For my, you know...

01:51.334 --> 01:53.100
-Expertise? -Yeah.

01:53.167 --> 01:55.701
Well, the good news for you, young lady, is you're involved.

01:55.767 --> 01:57.734
How?

01:57.801 --> 02:00.033
I'm doing one tonight. I'm getting quite a bit of money for it,

02:00.100 --> 02:02.133
as a bit goes, 300 quid.

02:02.200 --> 02:06.567
-So I need someone just to carry my bag. Organise... -Oh, well. I'm not...

02:06.634 --> 02:08.901
Hundred quid for an hour's work, tonight.

02:08.968 --> 02:10.000
Â£100 for an hour?

02:10.067 --> 02:11.567
-Yeah. -That is a lot.

02:11.634 --> 02:12.834
Eighty.

02:12.901 --> 02:14.567
-You just said 100. -90.

02:14.634 --> 02:16.300
-You just said 100. -All right, get there early then.

02:16.367 --> 02:20.601
All right, 'cause that's sharing the wealth, see. Looking after...

02:20.667 --> 02:25.067
That is silly money. 100 for that. I should have...

02:25.133 --> 02:28.133
Very exciting. It's what I've, you know, I've always wanted to do.

02:28.200 --> 02:29.968
It's that... It's that working...

02:30.033 --> 02:32.934
I've had these cards made up. Um...

02:33.000 --> 02:36.467
David Brent. Assertiveness and Guidance Training In Business.

02:36.534 --> 02:38.734
"If it's in you, I'll find it."

02:40.167 --> 02:42.367
That's actually what I do, you know.

02:42.434 --> 02:46.400
I go along and I just point out what you've already got. I'm like a spiritual guide.

02:46.467 --> 02:49.968
The reason I put "If it's in you, I'll find it" is if I waste, you know,

02:50.033 --> 02:51.367
good time and money looking for it

02:51.434 --> 02:52.934
and I can see it's definitely not in you,

02:53.000 --> 02:55.334
I don't wanna be sued 'cause you haven't got it, so...

02:55.400 --> 02:58.801
You know, you're not gonna get me on that.

03:00.133 --> 03:02.000
(INAUDIBLE)

03:05.901 --> 03:07.200
Mmm... Mmm.

03:11.734 --> 03:14.133
What's going on here?

03:14.200 --> 03:17.367
-What's it look like? -How long's this been going on?

03:17.434 --> 03:18.734
-When were you going to tell me? -Huh?

03:18.801 --> 03:20.234
(MUMBLES)

03:20.300 --> 03:22.701
Can't believe you get off with a bird that I fancy!

03:22.767 --> 03:24.901
Why can't you believe that, Gareth?

03:24.968 --> 03:28.067
What I can't believe is a bird that fancies you over me for a start. Well, you...

03:28.133 --> 03:31.634
He's a weird little bloke. Look at his cartoon face and his hair...

03:31.701 --> 03:35.868
He looks like a Fisher Price man with rubbish clothes.

03:35.934 --> 03:38.234
Makes me think there's something wrong with you for a start.

03:38.300 --> 03:41.467
But, yet, in my head, I'd still do you, so I'm confused.

03:42.968 --> 03:44.968
All right. I'll ask you straight.

03:45.033 --> 03:49.300
Is there anything that could happen between us two while this is going on?

03:49.367 --> 03:51.601
-Like what? -What, specifically?

03:52.801 --> 03:54.067
Yeah.

03:55.467 --> 03:58.500
Hand job? Look, don't answer. Think about it.

03:59.868 --> 04:01.000
(SCOFFS)

04:05.133 --> 04:08.133
-All right. Do I look like a Fisher Price man? -(SNIGGERING) Yeah!

04:08.200 --> 04:10.000
Do I? Don't say yeah.

04:16.734 --> 04:18.734
Hello.

04:18.801 --> 04:21.834
-Your favourite computer geek is here. -Jesus.

04:28.434 --> 04:31.067
All right, Simon? Er, how's it going?

04:33.901 --> 04:36.701
-Uh, what are you doing with my computer? -Um...

04:36.767 --> 04:40.400
It's not your computer, is it? It's Wernham Hogg's.

04:40.467 --> 04:43.734
-All right, what are you doing with Wernham Hogg's computer? -You don't need to know.

04:43.801 --> 04:47.400
No, I don't need to know, but could you tell me anyway?

04:47.467 --> 04:50.934
-I'm installing a firewall. -Okay. What's that?

04:51.000 --> 04:54.200
It protects your computer against, script-kitties, data collectors, viruses,

04:54.267 --> 04:57.534
ROMs and Trojan Horses and it limits your outbound internet communications.

04:57.601 --> 05:00.133
-Any more questions? -Yes, how long will it take?

05:00.200 --> 05:02.100
Why? Do you want to do it yourself?

05:02.167 --> 05:04.167
No, I can't do it myself. How long will it take you, out of interest?

05:04.234 --> 05:06.167
It'll take as long as it takes.

05:06.234 --> 05:09.701
-Right, um... How long did it take last time? -It's done.

05:09.767 --> 05:11.434
-All right, thank you. -Now I'm going to switch it off.

05:11.500 --> 05:15.133
When it comes back on, it'll ask you to hit, "yes, no or cancel."

05:15.200 --> 05:17.667
Hit cancel, do not hit yes or no.

05:17.734 --> 05:20.033
-All right. -Did you hear what I said?

05:20.100 --> 05:21.133
-Yep. -What did I say?

05:21.200 --> 05:22.400
-Hit cancel. -Good.

05:22.467 --> 05:23.434
Thanks.

05:25.834 --> 05:29.400
Um... I'm an educator.

05:29.467 --> 05:31.901
I'm a motivator of people.

05:31.968 --> 05:34.834
I excite their imaginations.

05:34.901 --> 05:37.167
It's like bloody Dead Poets Society sometimes out there.

05:37.234 --> 05:39.601
You know at the end where they all stand on the tables...

05:39.667 --> 05:42.534
I wouldn't want them to stand on the tables, literally.

05:42.601 --> 05:44.033
It's against health and safety for one thing.

05:44.100 --> 05:46.000
My point is this...

05:46.067 --> 05:49.367
Life is about communication. We live for three score year and ten.

05:49.434 --> 05:51.868
And it's, "Did I communicate?" "Yes, you did."

05:51.934 --> 05:54.000
"Did I get something across?" "Yes, you did."

05:54.067 --> 05:56.467
"Are you gonna pay me for it?" "Yes, lots. Thanks very much.

05:56.534 --> 05:58.567
"Not why I do it, but thank you."

06:04.500 --> 06:07.467
Going go-karting again at the weekend with the lads.

06:07.534 --> 06:10.968
-Oh, yeah. What? Down Superkarts? -Yeah.

06:11.033 --> 06:13.367
-You any good? -Came first, last time I went.

06:13.434 --> 06:16.500
Eight minutes, fifty one. Got a certificate.

06:16.567 --> 06:18.934
Well, I went down there the first day it opened, right?

06:19.000 --> 06:21.167
I did a couple laps and pulled over.

06:21.234 --> 06:24.167
The bloke that runs the thing came over and said, "Oi, no professionals."

06:24.234 --> 06:26.634
I took my helmet off and said, "I'm not a professional."

06:26.701 --> 06:28.133
He said, "You're not a professional?" I said, "No."

06:28.200 --> 06:29.701
He said, "Well you should be."

06:29.767 --> 06:31.667
"If I was you I'd take up Formula 1.

06:31.734 --> 06:33.968
"And if you drive like that you'll probably be the best in the country."

06:34.033 --> 06:38.834
I said, "I'm not interested, I'm making shitloads out of computers."

06:38.901 --> 06:41.667
-Have you ever had a go at Speedway? -Have you?

06:41.734 --> 06:44.234
-Yep. -Well, I was doing it once,

06:44.300 --> 06:48.834
and, um, I was bombing it round and some idiot had left like a ramp thing out.

06:48.901 --> 06:51.601
-Litter bugs. -I could see the people going, "Oh, my God!

06:51.667 --> 06:56.033
"If that guy hits that ramp, going at that speed. He's definitely dead."

06:56.100 --> 06:58.934
I hit the ramp, I took off in the air. I turned over in the air.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.267
They were going, "Whoa, he's definitely dead now."

07:01.334 --> 07:04.801
I landed on my wheels, pulled over and said, "What were you worried about?"

07:06.868 --> 07:08.601
-Er, about five? -Five.

07:08.667 --> 07:10.801
-Yeah. -And so who's this chap with again?

07:10.868 --> 07:12.634
-Well... -What's this then, a mothers' meeting?

07:12.701 --> 07:15.968
Dawn tells me she's shutting down reception at five?

07:16.033 --> 07:17.868
Well, just half hour

07:17.934 --> 07:20.734
-early today. -Do you think you can run okay without her?

07:20.801 --> 07:24.000
Yeah. Well, they can answer their own phones. They can do their own post tonight...

07:24.067 --> 07:27.000
All right, that's good. So we can probably lose her altogether, can we?

07:27.067 --> 07:28.901
What do you mean?

07:28.968 --> 07:30.734
Well, if you don't need a receptionist, we may as well let her go.

07:30.801 --> 07:32.467
-Either she's needed or she's not. -We do need a receptionist.

07:32.534 --> 07:34.868
My point is, David, you haven't put a system in place, you know.

07:35.067 --> 07:37.367
For your own needs you've told Dawn to shut down reception at 5:00.

07:37.434 --> 07:39.667
You haven't told these people they can pick up the phone if it rings.

07:39.734 --> 07:41.634
I mean does Dawn know that they can do their own posts?

07:41.701 --> 07:43.300
Dawn, they can do their own posts tonight.

07:43.367 --> 07:46.000
Yeah, there's no... There's no use telling her now.

07:46.067 --> 07:47.534
It's just there's no system in place.

07:47.601 --> 07:49.400
You're not thinking things through!

07:49.467 --> 07:51.400
-I'm tired of this fuzzy thinking, David. -All right. Chill out.

07:51.467 --> 07:53.200
Don't have a cow, mate.

07:53.267 --> 07:54.701
Don't talk to me like you've forgotten who's in charge here.

07:54.767 --> 07:58.033
-Let me remind you, I'm your boss, okay? -Yeah.

07:58.100 --> 08:00.467
Just try and think things through.

08:01.534 --> 08:02.634
(GROANS)

08:05.968 --> 08:09.400
That was your fault, eh. Took the rap for you, didn't I? Yeah.

08:14.567 --> 08:16.834
Once, all right, when Bruce Lee was filming,

08:16.901 --> 08:19.434
one of the extras just came over and just started a fight.

08:19.500 --> 08:21.434
Oh, yeah. I know this, and he was amazing at kung fu,

08:21.500 --> 08:23.234
but Bruce Lee just hit a round house on him.

08:23.300 --> 08:25.901
Well, no. He smashed him through a wall.

08:25.968 --> 08:28.133
Instead of firing him, he just said, "Go back to where you were,

08:28.200 --> 08:29.434
"let's get on with the filming."

08:29.500 --> 08:31.801
Man, those cats were as fast as lightning.

08:31.868 --> 08:33.801
You know when he's fighting Chuck Norris in Enter The Dragon?

08:33.868 --> 08:35.267
No.

08:35.334 --> 08:37.367
-You haven't you seen it? -No.

08:37.434 --> 08:40.567
Have you not... I can't... That is a classic.

08:40.634 --> 08:43.667
No, I've not seen him fight Chuck Norris in Enter The Dragon,

08:43.734 --> 08:45.968
I've seen him fight Chuck Norris in Way Of The Dragon.

08:46.033 --> 08:48.100
-That's what I meant that. That's what I... Yeah. -Is it?

08:48.167 --> 08:50.734
Why did you say you'd seen him fight Chuck Norris in Enter The Dragon?

08:50.801 --> 08:54.767
He fight Bob Wall in both. But Norris is only in Way Of The Dragon.

08:54.834 --> 08:57.234
Yeah, I know. So, when he's fighting Chuck Norris...

08:57.300 --> 08:58.601
-In what? -In Way Of The Dragon.

08:58.667 --> 08:59.968
Correct. At last.

09:00.534 --> 09:02.601
Um...

09:02.667 --> 09:05.100
You know, Bruce Lee's not really dead, don't you?

09:05.167 --> 09:07.834
Yeah, it's in a book. What he did was, he faked his own death,

09:07.901 --> 09:10.300
so he could work undercover for the Hong Kong police,

09:10.367 --> 09:12.868
infiltrating drugs gangs in the Triads.

09:12.934 --> 09:14.968
Yeah, I reckon that's true.

09:15.167 --> 09:16.834
Yeah, I reckon that's true, 'cause if you were going to send someone undercover

09:16.901 --> 09:18.901
to investigate the Triads,

09:18.968 --> 09:20.968
you'd probably want the world's most famous Chinese film star.

09:21.033 --> 09:22.801
(BOTH LAUGHING)

09:22.868 --> 09:24.901
Gone off Dawn now, have you?

09:25.100 --> 09:26.834
-What? -Say what?

09:28.033 --> 09:29.434
What are you talking about?

09:30.234 --> 09:32.901
Just shut up. Shut up.

09:42.133 --> 09:46.033
Waiting on a credit check. 'Cause we've not worked with them for ages.

09:46.100 --> 09:47.968
So, I was thinking of going about four o'clock in the morning.

09:48.033 --> 09:49.067
-Yeah. -Hmm.

09:49.133 --> 09:51.200
(TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

09:51.267 --> 09:52.567
-Oi, Tim. -Hmm?

09:52.634 --> 09:54.634
You shagged her yet, or what?

09:54.701 --> 09:56.500
-What? -Your bird, what's her name?

09:56.567 --> 09:58.634
-Rachel. -Yeah, Rachel. You done it yet, or what?

09:58.701 --> 10:00.400
Of course he hasn't!

10:03.334 --> 10:05.300
I don't kiss and tell, Lee, so...

10:06.367 --> 10:08.467
LEE: I bet you bloody have, ain't ya?

10:11.567 --> 10:15.767
Lips are sealed. So... (LAUGHS) Don't ask me!

10:15.834 --> 10:19.033
-Oh, he's done well there. -What do you mean, "done well?"

10:19.100 --> 10:22.300
LEE: Well, she's tasty. She's nice.

10:22.367 --> 10:23.567
Yeah, but you don't even know her!

10:23.634 --> 10:25.200
No, I mean, she's very attractive.

10:25.267 --> 10:27.400
She's not very attractive.

10:29.067 --> 10:30.901
I think, um, Ray'll introduce me.

10:30.968 --> 10:34.033
And I'll come out. I'll do a bit of, you know, a few gags etc.

10:34.100 --> 10:37.200
And then, um, I'll go, "Right. You have to be thick-skinned in business.

10:37.267 --> 10:39.701
"It doesn't matter if you are the tea boy or the General Manager,

10:39.767 --> 10:42.100
"People will try and rock your confidence and shake your spirit.

10:42.167 --> 10:45.067
"Do not listen to them, yeah? Let's try a little exercise."

10:45.133 --> 10:47.334
And I'll just go into the audience. And I'll pick on someone at random.

10:47.400 --> 10:49.601
I'll just go, "You, sir, what's your name?"

10:50.834 --> 10:52.500
-Say your name. -Leroy.

10:52.567 --> 10:54.067
Where's Leroy come from?

10:54.133 --> 10:55.367
The coloured fella off of Fame.

10:55.434 --> 10:57.834
-Well, use your own name. -Oh! Gareth.

10:57.901 --> 10:59.200
Hi, Gareth.

10:59.267 --> 11:00.968
Gareth, insult me, yeah?

11:01.033 --> 11:03.133
Let me show you that sticks and stones may break my bones,

11:03.200 --> 11:05.500
but names will never hurt me.

11:05.567 --> 11:07.267
Just throw some insults at me just to, you know...

11:07.334 --> 11:09.367
I'll show you how to roll with the punches.

11:09.434 --> 11:11.667
Um... Swindon lot don't seem to respect you.

11:11.734 --> 11:13.667
Why would they say that? They don't know me.

11:13.734 --> 11:15.734
They're not going to know that... And it's not true,

11:15.801 --> 11:17.334
Do something else.

11:17.400 --> 11:19.100
Um, lot of people are laughing at the heels on your shoes.

11:19.167 --> 11:21.667
I'm not going to be wearing the shoes, am I?

11:21.734 --> 11:23.133
Are you going to be wearing the ear ring?

11:23.200 --> 11:24.234
Well, they're having a go at that as well, are they?

11:24.300 --> 11:25.968
-Some people are. -What else?

11:26.033 --> 11:28.801
-Um, they've given you a nickname. -What? The Swindon lot?

11:28.868 --> 11:30.968
-Yeah, but everyone's using it. -What is it?

11:31.033 --> 11:33.500
-Well, I don't really... -No, come on. What is it?

11:33.567 --> 11:34.834
Bluto.

11:34.901 --> 11:36.500
-The villain from Popeye? -Yeah.

11:36.567 --> 11:38.234
What, 'cause of the beard?

11:38.300 --> 11:40.367
-It's because he's... -What's that?

11:40.434 --> 11:42.667
That's...

11:42.734 --> 11:44.934
-I can't believe it. -Don't... They'll know it was me that told you. David!

11:48.534 --> 11:52.434
DAVID: Hello. Sorry, everybody. Um, look.

11:52.500 --> 11:55.567
We are one big happy family here. Yeah?

11:55.634 --> 11:58.634
Now, I've been trying to welcome you new guys.

11:58.701 --> 12:02.100
You know, I didn't want you here, but you're here now. So, you know, well done.

12:02.167 --> 12:03.167
Welcome.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.901
But...

12:05.968 --> 12:08.133
If there's one thing I don't like... It's nicknames, yeah?

12:08.200 --> 12:10.968
Because nicknames are...

12:11.601 --> 12:14.100
Bad names.

12:15.834 --> 12:17.300
Yeah?

12:17.367 --> 12:19.367
They're not helpful, yeah?

12:19.434 --> 12:22.500
They can be very hurtful. Not to me. It's like water off a duck's back.

12:22.567 --> 12:25.067
You used to call Malcolm "Kojak".

12:25.133 --> 12:26.734
That was affectionate.

12:26.801 --> 12:29.467
You know, he was a great detective and a fine actor.

12:29.534 --> 12:31.634
Well, maybe Mr Toad's affectionate.

12:31.701 --> 12:35.200
-Who's Mr Toad? -Some people call you that as well.

12:35.267 --> 12:38.067
-I thought I was Bluto? -Yeah. Bluto and Mr Toad.

12:38.868 --> 12:41.500
Why am I Mr Toad?

12:41.567 --> 12:45.467
There's the face again. What? That's an insult, wasn't it? Very...

12:46.667 --> 12:48.667
Body fascism. That's what that is.

12:48.734 --> 12:51.868
The toad is the ugliest of all the amphibians.

12:51.934 --> 12:55.901
If we're handing out insults for being fat, let's have a go at him.

12:55.968 --> 12:57.734
Look at him. What...

12:57.801 --> 13:01.334
And he's got glasses. Let's call... Four-eyes, as well.

13:01.400 --> 13:04.434
Why don't we call him "Fatty, Fatty Toad Boy," if we're...

13:04.500 --> 13:07.400
You know, at least start on him then move on.

13:09.901 --> 13:12.267
Mr Toad! I can't...

13:20.400 --> 13:23.834
-Everything adding up? -Yeah, just about. It was a real mess before him.

13:23.901 --> 13:25.167
-Was it? -Oh, yeah.

13:25.234 --> 13:26.767
-On top of it now? -Yes.

13:26.834 --> 13:28.467
What about you, Brenda, how are things?

13:28.534 --> 13:31.200
Yeah, all right but I didn't get my wages through again.

13:31.267 --> 13:33.067
-Did you not, really? -Mmm-mmm.

13:33.133 --> 13:35.968
-Did you tell David? -Yeah, I told him in time.

13:36.033 --> 13:38.434
Oh, I'm... I'm really sorry about that. Let me get it sorted.

13:38.500 --> 13:39.934
Let me sort it out for you now.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.534
-I don't want to cause... -No, don't worry. It's fine.

13:46.033 --> 13:47.234
(DAVID GRUNTS)

13:48.667 --> 13:51.334
-Working hard? -Working out.

13:51.400 --> 13:54.834
Fit body, fit mind. Mind the gap.

13:54.901 --> 13:56.834
Good, um, couple of things...

13:56.901 --> 13:59.901
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

13:59.968 --> 14:02.400
Couple of things, David. Did your wages go through okay this month?

14:02.467 --> 14:04.033
-Yeah. -Yours, Gareth?

14:04.100 --> 14:05.234
Yeah, fine.

14:05.300 --> 14:06.834
Good. So you two are okay. Phew!

14:06.901 --> 14:09.234
Uh, why then has one of your team come to me saying

14:09.300 --> 14:11.100
they haven't been paid this month?

14:12.801 --> 14:14.567
'Cause... Oh... Uh?

14:15.968 --> 14:17.934
No.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.300
He fears my methods 'cause he doesn't understand my methods.

14:20.367 --> 14:22.734
You know, human nature. The unknown. Sure.

14:22.801 --> 14:24.801
But relax, you know.

14:24.868 --> 14:26.734
I don't want all this, "Oh, what're you doing? What're you doing?

14:26.801 --> 14:28.267
"How are you doing it?"

14:28.334 --> 14:31.367
No! Judge me by results.

14:31.434 --> 14:33.634
This is not the first time you've forgotten something important.

14:33.701 --> 14:35.701
It's not the first time this week.

14:35.767 --> 14:38.500
It worries me when someone feels they have to go over your head and come to me.

14:38.567 --> 14:41.567
-Snitches. -You know, I've never seen you write anything down.

14:41.634 --> 14:44.300
You've got two computers. I don't even know what you use them for.

14:44.367 --> 14:46.934
You've got to have some sort of system.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.801
-It's all up there. -Yeah, but it's not all up there, is it?

14:49.868 --> 14:52.367
-Most of it is. -Look, David, I'll tell you now, yeah...

14:52.434 --> 14:54.000
When I was managing the Swindon branch

14:54.067 --> 14:56.968
our perception of your branch was, "They're having a laugh."

14:57.033 --> 14:58.300
Thanks very much.

14:58.367 --> 15:00.434
No, no. Not in a good way. "Having a laugh."

15:00.500 --> 15:03.100
Mucking around at the expense of Wernham Hogg.

15:03.167 --> 15:06.000
Who's to say, if they weren't mucking around, having a laugh all the time,

15:06.067 --> 15:08.400
-it would be much worse... -I'm not interested in that, David.

15:08.467 --> 15:10.701
Look, I get the impression, you'd rather be popular

15:10.767 --> 15:13.067
-than steer the ship in the right direction. -Well, rubbish.

15:13.133 --> 15:16.868
And I resent the accusation, because this branch has performed very well.

15:16.934 --> 15:18.968
It's performed okay. I want it to perform a lot better.

15:19.033 --> 15:21.067
There you go. What is better?

15:21.133 --> 15:23.968
'Cause I could show you a graph of people versus task,

15:24.033 --> 15:26.934
-and where does the line go... -The line goes where I want it to go.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.434
Now, if you can't improve your margin and your volume sales,

15:29.500 --> 15:31.601
with or without making people laugh.

15:31.667 --> 15:35.267
If you can't do that, you and I are going to have to have a very serious chat.

15:35.334 --> 15:36.968
Is this why you're around all the time?

15:37.033 --> 15:38.601
Keeping tabs on me? 'Cause I don't need a baby-sitter.

15:38.667 --> 15:40.667
Well, with respect, David, I think you do.

15:40.734 --> 15:43.200
You know, I'm aware of this management training thing you're doing tonight.

15:43.267 --> 15:45.200
And I'm worried, it's going to affect your performance at work.

15:45.267 --> 15:46.734
That's extracurricular, you know.

15:46.801 --> 15:48.500
-Some people play golf... -Well, I play golf.

15:48.567 --> 15:49.734
There you go.

15:49.801 --> 15:51.634
Yes, but I'm performing as I want me to perform,

15:51.701 --> 15:53.500
you're not performing as I want you to perform.

15:53.567 --> 15:55.400
I'm performing as I want me to perform.

15:55.601 --> 15:57.367
-I don't want you to perform like that... -It's a good performance.

15:57.434 --> 16:01.033
-Let's agree to disagree. -No. Let's agree that you agree with me.

16:03.267 --> 16:06.834
Ooh, you're hard. Showing off 'cause...

16:06.901 --> 16:10.133
I think I've made my point, David. Thank you. I'll see you later.

16:10.834 --> 16:12.334
-Mmm. -(DOOR CLOSES)

16:20.467 --> 16:21.701
What are you doing?

16:21.767 --> 16:24.767
-You looked a bit tense. -I am with him...

16:24.834 --> 16:27.801
-Does that feel nice? -Yeah, but...

16:27.868 --> 16:31.000
-Do some more work on your abs? -Not now.

16:50.901 --> 16:52.400
(PHONE RINGING)

16:56.601 --> 16:57.968
(SIGHS)

17:15.300 --> 17:16.767
Is, uh, he ready yet?

17:16.834 --> 17:17.868
-Who? -David.

17:17.934 --> 17:19.467
Oh, I don't know. He should be.

17:20.500 --> 17:22.000
So, what are you doing tonight?

17:22.067 --> 17:24.200
I think we're just going to go out to the pub.

17:24.267 --> 17:25.834
-We is? -Me and Rachel.

17:25.901 --> 17:27.434
-Rachel. Excellent. -Mmm.

17:27.500 --> 17:29.667
-Just a couple of pints? -A couple of pints.

17:29.734 --> 17:31.267
-(LAUGHS) -We're in the mood.

17:31.334 --> 17:32.868
Well, um, think of me. Stuck with...

17:32.934 --> 17:34.868
(BOTH LAUGHING)

17:34.934 --> 17:36.968
-Oh, you should come for a laugh. -I think we'd better stay.

17:37.033 --> 17:38.901
Nah! Definitely! Wise.

17:38.968 --> 17:41.534
-All right, babes. -All right, mate.

17:41.601 --> 17:43.634
-See you. Yeah. -Have a good night. See you later.

17:53.434 --> 17:56.334
-See you later. Wish us luck on our date. -Yeah, good luck.

17:56.400 --> 17:58.400
It's not a date, is it?

17:58.467 --> 18:00.300
She's got a boyfriend and I'm paying her.

18:00.367 --> 18:01.634
What sort of date would that be?

18:01.701 --> 18:02.901
I think, you know. (GIGGLES)

18:02.968 --> 18:04.534
And 100 quid, what would I get for that?

18:04.601 --> 18:06.701
Not that I would. 'Cause you wouldn't... (MUMBLES)

18:06.767 --> 18:10.133
Everything, I imagine. I'm not imagining any of it, but I do know what sort...

18:10.200 --> 18:12.367
I'm just... Okay then, there we go.

18:12.434 --> 18:14.434
(GRUNTS) Carry that. That's what you're being paid for.

18:14.500 --> 18:15.767
See ya.

18:28.367 --> 18:29.801
(TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

18:31.701 --> 18:33.601
...they're coming through tonight.

18:33.667 --> 18:36.968
Two groups. They're both from Renley, I think and...

18:50.834 --> 18:54.801
Um, the other three guys, you know, they've all done it before, so...

18:54.868 --> 18:57.367
I'll introduce you when they get here.

18:57.434 --> 19:00.200
I love being backstage. Oh!

19:00.267 --> 19:02.467
Um, can we just take a photo?

19:02.534 --> 19:05.133
It's for the website and the newsletter. If that's okay?

19:05.200 --> 19:07.868
No problem. You gotta take a light reading?

19:07.934 --> 19:10.100
Oh, I think it'll be okay.

19:10.167 --> 19:11.901
-If you just... -Yeah.

19:17.400 --> 19:20.601
-I mean, just be yourself. You know, a bit more relaxed. -Yeah.

19:22.868 --> 19:24.234
Something like that?

19:26.667 --> 19:28.667
Not quite.

19:28.734 --> 19:29.868
Okay. Um...

19:30.934 --> 19:32.100
Just...

19:37.300 --> 19:40.734
-Maybe if you just sit down. -You're the boss. Ah!

19:44.934 --> 19:46.334
(CAMERA CLICKS)

19:48.667 --> 19:50.901
(CHATTERING)

19:54.267 --> 19:58.000
I'm looking forward to this, actually. It'll be quite a good one.

19:58.067 --> 19:59.500
-DAVID: Hi. -Hello, mate.

19:59.567 --> 20:03.000
Are you, er, you guys talking at this gig as well?

20:03.067 --> 20:05.567
Yeah. Just having a sneaky joint.

20:05.634 --> 20:07.434
Ah, well...

20:07.500 --> 20:09.234
Partially decriminalised now anyway, innit?

20:09.300 --> 20:12.067
So, at last... Go for it.

20:13.601 --> 20:15.701
-What's it? Skunk? -Mmm-mmm.

20:15.767 --> 20:17.467
It's just weed. Do you want a little taste?

20:17.534 --> 20:19.300
-You sure? -Yeah, no. I'm on a diet.

20:19.367 --> 20:21.100
Yeah, I would but...

20:21.167 --> 20:24.801
When I get wasted I go to munchie city, so, you know. Yeah.

20:24.868 --> 20:27.601
I'm mad enough without the gear as well, so...

20:27.667 --> 20:29.234
I'll take a rain check. I'll catch you later, yeah.

20:29.300 --> 20:30.701
-Chill. All right, cool. -BOTH: Yeah.

20:33.634 --> 20:37.367
Um... Well, we've got four speakers for you tonight, so no messing about.

20:37.434 --> 20:40.601
To begin with, from Sound Investments, Mr Mark Found.

20:46.901 --> 20:49.300
Let me dispel a myth.

20:49.367 --> 20:52.100
Just because you're a success in your life,

20:52.167 --> 20:55.901
some people will tell you that you shouldn't be able to sleep at night.

20:55.968 --> 20:58.901
You should. Why?

20:58.968 --> 21:00.367
Because this is a business.

21:02.300 --> 21:04.701
Your future hasn't happened yet.

21:04.767 --> 21:08.434
You shape it. You're in the driving seat.

21:09.100 --> 21:10.567
Thanks.

21:15.801 --> 21:19.434
Er, thanks to Richard Clark there from Stockport Graphics.

21:19.500 --> 21:23.634
Uh, now with some words of advice on motivational techniques from Wernham Hogg,

21:23.701 --> 21:25.234
Mr David Brent.

21:42.067 --> 21:43.267
Get out.

21:45.534 --> 21:47.000
Go on.

21:47.067 --> 21:49.167
I've opened the door for you. Yeah?

21:50.667 --> 21:54.133
If you don't want to make it, go now. Yeah?

21:54.200 --> 21:57.601
Save us all a bit of time. Yeah? If you don't think you can cut it.

22:01.133 --> 22:04.400
No? Good.

22:04.467 --> 22:06.968
-Have you finished now? -No! I'm in the...

22:10.467 --> 22:11.400
Okay.

22:14.734 --> 22:16.601
You're all looking at me and you're going...

22:16.667 --> 22:19.300
"Oh, yeah. You're a success. You've achieved your goals, yeah.

22:19.367 --> 22:21.334
"You're reaping the rewards."

22:21.400 --> 22:25.934
Sure. "But, oi, Brent! Is all you care about, chasing the Yankee dollar?"

22:26.000 --> 22:28.334
Let me show you something I always keep with me.

22:30.500 --> 22:32.067
Just a little book.

22:32.133 --> 22:33.868
Collective meditations and it's a...

22:33.934 --> 22:37.000
It's a collection of philosophers, writers, thinkers,

22:37.067 --> 22:40.100
Native American wisdom...

22:40.167 --> 22:44.434
(STAMMERING) Which I... And it's really showing you the...

22:44.500 --> 22:48.000
The spiritual side needs as much care and attention as the physical side.

22:48.067 --> 22:50.567
It's about feeding the soul. Yeah?

22:50.634 --> 22:54.500
Evolving spirituality in... Foreword by Duncan Goodhew.

22:55.667 --> 22:56.734
So...

22:58.567 --> 23:01.500
Can I read one... Which I think...

23:01.567 --> 23:04.968
"If all men were to bring their miseries together in one place,

23:05.033 --> 23:09.701
"most would be glad to take each his own home again

23:09.767 --> 23:13.133
"rather than take a portion out of the common stock."

23:13.200 --> 23:15.300
It's saying, for the first time,

23:15.367 --> 23:18.434
you know, the grass isn't always greener on the other side.

23:18.500 --> 23:20.167
Don't look over your neighbour's fence and go,

23:20.234 --> 23:21.834
"Ooh, he's got a better car than me.

23:21.901 --> 23:25.667
"Ooh, he's got a more attractive wife."

23:25.734 --> 23:29.400
We all wake up and we go, "Oh, I ache. I'm not 18 any more."

23:29.467 --> 23:32.701
You know, I'm thirty-n... I'm in my thirties.

23:32.767 --> 23:34.901
But, so what? At least I've got my health.

23:34.968 --> 23:37.667
And if you haven't got your health, if you've got one leg...

23:37.734 --> 23:40.167
At least I haven't got two legs missing.

23:40.234 --> 23:46.267
If you have lost both legs and both arms, just go, "At least I'm not dead!"

23:46.334 --> 23:50.133
Er, I'd rather be dead in that situation.

23:50.200 --> 23:54.601
To be honest, I'm not saying people like that should be, you know, put down.

23:57.234 --> 24:00.267
I'm saying that in my life,

24:00.334 --> 24:03.300
I'd rather not live without arms and legs because...

24:03.367 --> 24:05.667
You know, I'm just getting into Yoga,

24:05.734 --> 24:07.434
for one thing, so...

24:08.234 --> 24:10.834
In my opinion...

24:10.901 --> 24:14.968
Are you familiar with the term, "Laughter is the best medicine"?

24:17.734 --> 24:19.467
Well, it's true, eh?

24:19.534 --> 24:23.000
When you laugh, your brain releases endorphins, yeah?

24:23.067 --> 24:25.000
Your stress hormones are reduced.

24:25.067 --> 24:30.167
And the oxygen supply to your blood is increased. So you feel...

24:30.234 --> 24:33.234
I try and laugh several times a day just... 'Cause it makes you feel good.

24:33.300 --> 24:35.834
So let's... Let's try that.

24:35.901 --> 24:38.834
(LAUGHS) Eh? Just, just...

24:38.901 --> 24:41.734
(LAUGHING) Come on. Trust me, you'll feel...

24:41.801 --> 24:43.801
(LAUGHS MANIACALLY)

24:49.033 --> 24:50.033
Eh?

24:52.834 --> 24:54.834
Ooh! Yeah?

25:01.500 --> 25:02.400
Oh!

25:02.467 --> 25:04.100
(CONTINUES LAUGHING)

25:06.767 --> 25:12.267
DAWN: I'd be lying if I said my life had turned out exactly as I'd expected.

25:12.334 --> 25:18.300
My old school just recently had a school reunion, um, which I didn't go to.

25:18.367 --> 25:21.701
But one girl in my class, it turns out, right,

25:21.767 --> 25:24.934
that she's now running her own internet auction website.

25:25.000 --> 25:28.167
Making a fortune and is happily married to a marine biologist.

25:29.200 --> 25:31.901
She used to eat chalk.

25:32.100 --> 25:35.667
(SIGHS) Okay, well, that's about it, from yours truly.

25:35.734 --> 25:37.834
Thanks for taking all I had to throw at you.

25:37.901 --> 25:43.300
I'm spent. But, um, I am now gonna make like a banana and split.

25:43.367 --> 25:46.500
(LAUGHS) He got it!

25:46.567 --> 25:50.133
Okay, um, before I go though, um...

25:50.200 --> 25:53.901
Promise me you'll remember one thing, yeah.

25:53.968 --> 25:55.133
-Just remember... -(SWITCHES ON)

25:55.200 --> 25:57.367
# You're the best

25:59.334 --> 26:01.934
# Better than all the rest

26:02.000 --> 26:03.067
Yeah!

26:03.834 --> 26:06.334
# Better than anyone

26:06.400 --> 26:07.734
Come on. Listen to it.

26:08.701 --> 26:10.868
# Anyone I've ever met

26:10.934 --> 26:12.400
Come on. Get into it.

26:12.467 --> 26:14.667
# Ooh, I'm stuck on your heart

26:14.734 --> 26:17.000
Yeah! Whoo!

26:17.067 --> 26:20.834
I've been David Brent. You've been the best. Goodnight.

26:21.968 --> 26:24.734
# Tear us apart

26:26.634 --> 26:31.467
# Baby, I would rather be dead

26:31.534 --> 26:34.901
# In your heart I see the star And every night... #

26:34.968 --> 26:36.701
(SWITCHES OFF)

26:36.767 --> 26:39.300
-Um, yes, our thanks to David... -You stopped it.

26:39.367 --> 26:41.067
-I... -No, don't stop it.

26:41.133 --> 26:43.367
Leave it going right to the end till I get...

26:44.167 --> 26:45.634
(MUMBLES)

26:45.701 --> 26:48.067
-Don't do that again next time. Okay? -Sorry.

26:48.133 --> 26:49.267
Yeah!

26:49.334 --> 26:52.000
Er, David Brent from Wernham Hogg.

26:52.067 --> 26:53.968
(FAINT APPLAUSE)

26:59.901 --> 27:02.100
I'll let you into a secret now, all right.

27:02.167 --> 27:05.300
Before I went out there, I was worried whether I still had it. (CHUCKLES)

27:05.367 --> 27:06.801
I'll let you be the judge of that.

27:06.868 --> 27:09.500
High five! Don't leave me hanging, Dawn.

27:09.567 --> 27:10.801
Oh, God!

27:10.868 --> 27:12.100
Oh, jeez.

27:12.167 --> 27:15.400
Oh, here he is. Oh!

27:15.467 --> 27:17.267
-Tina a bit too much for you? -Possibly.

27:17.334 --> 27:18.934
Well, it's your job.

27:19.133 --> 27:21.133
Hold me back, 'cause when I'm out there, I am... (VOCALISES)

27:21.200 --> 27:22.601
And it's like... (VOCALISES)

27:22.667 --> 27:24.634
So that's up to you, I'm afraid.

27:24.701 --> 27:26.901
Oh, jeez!

27:26.968 --> 27:29.267
Tell you what though, they seemed to go for it, didn't they?

27:29.334 --> 27:30.701
-Knock, knock. -Oh, yeah.

27:30.767 --> 27:32.734
-You all right? -Yeah. Well done.

27:32.801 --> 27:35.868
-What d'you think? -Well, my tastes are quite traditional.

27:35.934 --> 27:37.267
Bit too rock 'n' roll for you?

27:37.334 --> 27:39.200
-Possibly. -Each his own. Each his own.

27:39.267 --> 27:41.100
I better warn you now...

27:41.167 --> 27:43.734
That was me on a seven. Wait till you see me on a nine or ten.

27:43.801 --> 27:45.334
Here's your cheque.

27:45.400 --> 27:47.734
Thanking you. Well, there you go.

27:47.801 --> 27:50.601
More importantly, though, what pub we going to?

27:50.667 --> 27:51.834
(DAVID CHUCKLES)

27:53.667 --> 27:56.400
More important than that... 300 quid... I don't think so!

27:56.467 --> 27:58.100
Oh, where are we going?

27:58.167 --> 28:00.834
Uh, we can't. We're just gonna grab some food. Go home.

28:00.901 --> 28:03.701
Pizza? Yeah?

28:03.767 --> 28:06.367
Never mind Pizza Express. What about Beer Express first?

28:06.434 --> 28:08.667
Next stop, drunkenness. Whoo! (CHUCKLES)

28:08.734 --> 28:10.334
It doesn't have to be. Go anywhere you want.

28:10.400 --> 28:12.500
Chinese, Indian...

28:12.567 --> 28:15.467
As long as it's, you know... It's on me!

28:17.300 --> 28:19.300
Here we go. The Three Musketeers.

28:20.033 --> 28:22.234
Bye.

28:22.300 --> 28:23.868
WOMAN: Oh, I just remembered, I can't.

28:23.934 --> 28:25.601
RAY: What do you mean?

28:25.667 --> 28:27.434
JUDE: I've just remembered something I've got to do.

28:27.500 --> 28:30.234
DAVID: Oh-oh! Just us two, then? Oh, no.

28:30.300 --> 28:31.901
What sort of clubs are round here?

28:31.968 --> 28:33.267
RAY: I'm not going to a club with you. DAVID: You bloody are!

28:33.334 --> 28:34.934
(DAVID LAUGHING)

28:42.434 --> 28:46.000
# So what becomes of you, my love?

28:48.434 --> 28:52.734
# When they have finally stripped you off

28:52.801 --> 28:55.434
# The handbags and the gladrags

28:55.500 --> 28:57.868
# That your granddad had to sweat

28:57.934 --> 28:59.701
# So you could buy #
