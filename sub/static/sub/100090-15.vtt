WEBVTT

00:04.352 --> 00:06.963
- Think we found our guy.
Logan Peters.

00:07.007 --> 00:08.660
- We got intel he's hanging
with the Southside Hustlers.

00:08.704 --> 00:10.053
Roman said he'd call you once
he found the guy, but--

00:10.097 --> 00:12.229
- Wait a second,
you talking about Sean Roman?

00:12.273 --> 00:14.405
Kim's ex-partner?
What's he got to do with this?

00:14.449 --> 00:17.495
- My little sister Sarah,
she went missing last week.

00:17.539 --> 00:18.714
I need to know what happened.

00:18.757 --> 00:20.368
- Sean's in Chicago?

00:20.411 --> 00:22.022
- You're not a cop anymore.

00:22.065 --> 00:24.894
- No, but I'm Sarah's
big brother.

00:24.937 --> 00:27.505
- 'Cause I can't blame Sean
for putting his family first.

00:27.549 --> 00:29.116
I mean, let's do what we can
to help him.

00:30.726 --> 00:32.597
- Here we go.

00:41.258 --> 00:44.261
- What do we got?
- Fire's contained.

00:44.305 --> 00:45.828
Got a couple smoke
inhalation injuries.

00:45.871 --> 00:48.135
They're on their way now
to Med with the GSW victim,

00:48.178 --> 00:49.484
Travis.

00:49.527 --> 00:51.094
Believe he started the fire.

00:51.138 --> 00:53.227
Smelled gasoline
when we entered.

00:53.270 --> 00:55.533
- So the, uh, shooter's
the dealer, Logan Peters?

00:55.577 --> 00:57.231
- Yeah, he's in the wind.
Fled during the fire.

00:57.274 --> 00:59.885
It's too late for a perimeter.

01:01.844 --> 01:05.065
All right, well,
Kim will take your statement.

01:05.108 --> 01:06.762
Someplace quiet, huh?

01:20.863 --> 01:22.473
- Okay, what's going on?

01:22.517 --> 01:24.258
- I arrived here
after tracking Logan.

01:24.301 --> 01:26.912
- I'm not actually asking
for your statement.

01:26.956 --> 01:29.132
I'm asking why the hell
you didn't come to us.

01:29.176 --> 01:30.916
- My sister's missing.
I'm looking for her.

01:30.960 --> 01:33.484
- Yeah, we have an entire unit
that specializes in just that.

01:33.528 --> 01:37.662
Not to mention, you have me.
And Intelligence.

01:37.706 --> 01:40.143
- I went to Fire first
because of the ODs.

01:40.187 --> 01:41.753
- No...

01:41.797 --> 01:43.233
I rode in a car with you
for two years.

01:43.277 --> 01:45.061
I know when you're lying.
- I couldn't come to you.

01:45.105 --> 01:47.672
- I don't care
that we broke up.

01:47.716 --> 01:48.847
- It's not that.

01:50.632 --> 01:52.764
- Do you realize how bad
this looks for you right now?

01:52.808 --> 01:54.288
You're at the scene
of a shooting--

01:54.331 --> 01:56.072
I can book you as a suspect.
- You gotta be kidding me.

01:56.116 --> 01:58.770
I was a cop.
- You're not anymore.

01:58.814 --> 02:00.163
All right?

02:00.207 --> 02:01.338
So if you want,
I'll take you down

02:01.382 --> 02:02.252
to the station,
then you can answer

02:02.296 --> 02:03.471
my questions in the box.

02:03.514 --> 02:05.125
Your choice.

02:08.389 --> 02:10.695
- She's dealing for him.

02:10.739 --> 02:12.784
- What?

02:12.828 --> 02:16.440
- My sister's an addict.
She has been for a while now.

02:16.484 --> 02:18.138
And I think she's dealing
for her boyfriend.

02:18.181 --> 02:20.444
And if she is,
and a teenager died,

02:20.488 --> 02:24.448
then she's staring down
a drug induced homicide charge.

02:24.492 --> 02:27.886
So yeah, I went to Fire first
and lied my ass off.

02:27.930 --> 02:30.628
- Hey, hey, hey.

02:30.672 --> 02:34.197
Look, I need you
to trust me now, okay?

02:34.241 --> 02:38.070
Just...trust me, okay?

02:41.683 --> 02:43.293
- We've been treating
at least three ODs an hour,

02:43.337 --> 02:44.947
like stopping running water.

02:44.990 --> 02:46.209
This kid who set the fire?

02:46.253 --> 02:47.602
- Yeah.
- Travis Butler.

02:47.645 --> 02:49.212
Paramedics brought him in
15 minutes ago,

02:49.256 --> 02:50.953
GSW to the stomach,
smoke inhalation.

02:50.996 --> 02:52.302
He's still in surgery, but--
- If you're saying this place

02:52.346 --> 02:53.825
is too busy,
then you see my daughter first.

02:53.869 --> 02:54.696
- No, but my son's in worse
condition than your daughter.

02:54.739 --> 02:55.914
- Sir, sit down.

02:55.958 --> 02:57.089
- This kid could've killed
everyone in there.

02:57.133 --> 02:58.439
- Hey, what's going on?

02:58.482 --> 02:59.396
- Victims from the fire
were brought here,

02:59.440 --> 03:00.832
and so was Travis.

03:00.876 --> 03:02.269
- I do know that you--
- Get your hands off of me!

03:02.312 --> 03:03.835
- Police!
Hey, police!

03:03.879 --> 03:05.228
- Get off of me!

03:05.272 --> 03:07.012
- Hey!
Police!

03:07.056 --> 03:08.231
- Come on!

03:08.275 --> 03:09.798
- Police!
You need to calm down!

03:09.841 --> 03:11.495
- Calm down. Calm down.
- My son's in worse condition.

03:11.539 --> 03:13.193
- Calm down.
- Okay.

03:14.498 --> 03:16.500
- Come on, let's go this way.

03:23.464 --> 03:26.336
- I'm sorry...I would never
hit a cop--a woman.

03:26.380 --> 03:28.512
I'm sorry.
- It's okay, I'm fine.

03:28.556 --> 03:30.862
- They say my son started
the fire.

03:30.906 --> 03:33.038
- Uh, we believe the guy
who shot your son

03:33.082 --> 03:34.649
is also involved
in other crimes.

03:34.692 --> 03:36.259
- What?
- He was in the apartment

03:36.303 --> 03:39.044
where the fire started.
- No witnesses saw Logan flee.

03:39.088 --> 03:40.220
- Mr. Butler?
- Yeah?

03:40.263 --> 03:42.091
- Surgery went well.
Travis is stable.

03:42.134 --> 03:43.832
- Can I see him?
- Mm-hmm.

03:46.226 --> 03:48.228
- Thanks.

03:48.271 --> 03:49.272
- See you guys.
Thank you.

03:49.316 --> 03:50.230
- Good work.
- Thanks.

03:50.273 --> 03:51.709
- Yeah.

03:51.753 --> 03:53.363
- No, I didn't see
where Logan went.

03:53.407 --> 03:57.715
He, uh, he shot me, I saw him
leave the room, but that's all.

03:57.759 --> 04:00.152
- How well do you know Logan?
You know where he might run to?

04:00.196 --> 04:01.893
- I don't know him at all.

04:01.937 --> 04:05.375
Friend of mine told me
where to find him.

04:05.419 --> 04:07.203
Told me he killed
my girlfriend.

04:07.247 --> 04:09.727
- He dealt to her?

04:09.771 --> 04:13.731
- She was happy.
She was perfect.

04:13.775 --> 04:17.518
Then he started selling to her.

04:17.561 --> 04:20.260
He's responsible for this.

04:21.739 --> 04:24.351
I was just trying
to make it right.

04:27.441 --> 04:30.966
I'm going to jail, aren't I?

04:36.450 --> 04:37.886
- Oh, man.

04:37.929 --> 04:40.584
I should've told you
to come here from the jump.

04:40.628 --> 04:43.370
I'm sorry.
I steered you wrong.

04:43.413 --> 04:44.545
- Well, I'm here now.

04:44.588 --> 04:46.590
- You, uh, you gonna
talk to Voight?

04:46.634 --> 04:48.505
- Yeah.
- Hey, O'Malley.

04:48.549 --> 04:52.204
- Oh, come on, I finally got
detailed to TACT.

04:52.248 --> 04:54.337
But who needs a three-house
raid when there's the honor

04:54.381 --> 04:56.165
of covering your desk?

04:56.208 --> 04:57.645
Hey, welcome back.
- Thanks.

04:57.688 --> 05:00.430
- Sorry to hear about the--
- Thank you.

05:00.474 --> 05:03.346
- Sorry for your loss.

05:03.390 --> 05:06.131
- What's he talking about?
- Uh, I got injured on the job.

05:06.175 --> 05:07.655
That's all.

05:09.483 --> 05:10.832
- My mother called me
last week.

05:10.875 --> 05:13.269
She found pills
in Sarah's room.

05:13.313 --> 05:14.879
Flushed them, then accused
her of dealing.

05:14.923 --> 05:17.752
Which didn't go well.
- She ran?

05:17.795 --> 05:19.623
- She's been gone nine days.
- Hmm.

05:19.667 --> 05:21.756
- We thought she ran off
with her boyfriend.

05:21.799 --> 05:23.801
I didn't even know his name
until yesterday.

05:23.845 --> 05:25.499
Logan Peters.

05:25.542 --> 05:28.328
- Hmm.
- If she did sell to those kids

05:28.371 --> 05:29.720
that OD'd...

05:29.764 --> 05:32.984
She's looking at a big charge.

05:33.028 --> 05:34.856
- I know her, Sarge.
She's a good kid.

05:34.899 --> 05:39.077
She's just down on her luck,
needs our help.

05:39.121 --> 05:41.123
- Well, we find her first,
we'll do what we can

05:41.166 --> 05:44.474
to protect her.
- Okay.

05:44.518 --> 05:46.911
- All right.

05:48.348 --> 05:50.915
You can roll with Kim.

05:50.959 --> 05:52.526
On a short leash.

05:55.050 --> 05:56.660
I'm gonna tell you something,
you go off on your own

05:56.704 --> 05:59.271
while you're with my unit...

05:59.315 --> 06:02.840
you're gonna see a whole other
side of me, you understand?

06:02.884 --> 06:04.973
- Yeah.

06:05.016 --> 06:06.801
- Okay, he's yours.

06:09.281 --> 06:11.588
- Thank you.
- Mm.

06:11.632 --> 06:14.852
- Ann Hoffman, 15.
Clarke Preston, 17.

06:14.896 --> 06:17.855
Two more ODs pronounced
at Med in the last 24 hours.

06:17.899 --> 06:21.511
And their tox report matches
our original DOA, Brandi.

06:21.555 --> 06:23.600
Mass amounts of fentanyl
in their systems.

06:23.644 --> 06:27.038
- Same compound product our
dealer Logan Peters is pushing.

06:27.082 --> 06:29.867
The kid's got a few priors
for possession, theft,

06:29.911 --> 06:34.655
and a statutory rate charge.
He was 23, his girlfriend, 15.

06:34.698 --> 06:37.048
Charge was dismissed.
- All right, and the pills?

06:37.092 --> 06:39.616
- Thinking Mexican oxy.
Looks, feels, tastes like

06:39.660 --> 06:42.227
regular oxy, but it's fake.
Made with fentanyl, instead.

06:42.271 --> 06:44.534
Comes directly from cartels,
and is dealt to Hispanic gangs

06:44.578 --> 06:47.885
in the city.
- I got something.

06:47.929 --> 06:49.931
- Latin Players said Logan
wasn't getting product

06:49.974 --> 06:51.933
from them.
Southside Hustlers were

06:51.976 --> 06:54.239
granting him asylum.
- Well, begs the question,

06:54.283 --> 06:56.459
where's he getting his product?
- Witness popped.

06:56.503 --> 06:57.895
Guy across the street
from the fire says

06:57.939 --> 06:59.810
he saw Logan running
towards the L.

06:59.854 --> 07:01.377
I pulled the footage.
He got off at Wilson.

07:01.421 --> 07:03.510
- All right, so run all Logan
Peters' known associates

07:03.553 --> 07:04.685
near that stop.

07:04.728 --> 07:06.904
I mean, the guy's hiding
somewhere, right?

07:06.948 --> 07:09.472
We find him, flip him for his
supplier, get this product

07:09.516 --> 07:11.822
off the street
before that board grows.

07:11.866 --> 07:15.130
- Hey, you, uh, you want me
to ride with you, or...

07:15.173 --> 07:16.261
- No.

07:16.305 --> 07:18.438
Smaller numbers,
it's a quicker spread.

07:18.481 --> 07:20.440
- Right, okay.
- Yeah.

07:20.483 --> 07:22.267
- Well, we'll see you
back here.

07:24.618 --> 07:26.576
- What was that in there?
- What?

07:26.620 --> 07:28.491
- You seem different.

07:28.535 --> 07:30.754
- No, we just haven't
spoken in years.

07:30.798 --> 07:33.061
- Your unit seems to be walking
on eggshells around you,

07:33.104 --> 07:34.976
especially Ruzek.

07:36.630 --> 07:37.674
- You should've
stuck around, Roman.

07:37.718 --> 07:39.589
You would've made detective.

07:39.633 --> 07:43.027
And you seem different too.

07:46.074 --> 07:48.598
- No, hey, you can't just
come in.

07:48.642 --> 07:50.557
- You answer the door high,
holding a joint.

07:50.600 --> 07:52.733
Not sure what you expect.
- I ain't high.

07:52.776 --> 07:54.430
And it's legal now.

07:54.474 --> 07:56.040
- No, man, you're high
on something a lot stronger

07:56.084 --> 07:57.651
than marijuana,
and you're on probation--

07:57.694 --> 07:58.913
- Baby, can you please
not be so loud?

07:58.956 --> 08:01.437
- Hey, hey, come here.
Get over here. Hey!

08:01.481 --> 08:02.786
Let's go.

08:02.830 --> 08:04.919
You trying to get to
the drugs before we do?

08:04.962 --> 08:07.748
- Mm.
- Have a seat. Sit down!

08:07.791 --> 08:09.619
- All right,
you answer my questions,

08:09.663 --> 08:11.447
I won't search this place,
we have a deal?

08:11.491 --> 08:12.796
You know this guy,
Logan Peters?

08:12.840 --> 08:15.146
- I don't know him.
- You do know him.

08:15.190 --> 08:16.670
He listed this address
for two months

08:16.713 --> 08:18.149
after he got out of prison.
Try again.

08:18.193 --> 08:19.237
- Hey, look at this.

08:19.281 --> 08:20.717
- Haven't seen him
in a long time.

08:20.761 --> 08:22.327
- What about her?
Sarah Roman.

08:22.371 --> 08:23.764
You know her?
She dating Logan?

08:23.807 --> 08:27.942
- Don't know her.
- Do you know her?

08:27.985 --> 08:29.857
- Uh...
- We don't know her.

08:29.900 --> 08:31.685
- Hey, does it look like
I'm talking to you?

08:31.728 --> 08:33.643
Do you know her?

08:33.687 --> 08:35.689
- She's my little sister.
-  Baby, no.

08:35.732 --> 08:37.517
- Well, she doesn't look
like that anymore.

08:37.560 --> 08:38.866
- Oh, my God.

08:38.909 --> 08:41.782
- So you've seen her?
- Day--day--days ago.

08:41.825 --> 08:43.740
- Okay, where, where's
the last place you saw her?

08:43.784 --> 08:45.437
Logan doesn't date these girls.

08:45.481 --> 08:48.876
He just...plays with them.

08:48.919 --> 08:50.312
- Listen, I don't care about
that, I want to know where

08:50.355 --> 08:53.228
the last place
you saw Sarah was.

08:53.271 --> 08:54.403
Look at me, not at him.

08:54.446 --> 08:56.579
Where's the last place
you saw Sarah?

08:59.887 --> 09:01.758
- The old lake house.

09:01.802 --> 09:03.673
We break in there
to party sometimes.

09:03.717 --> 09:06.067
- I want that address now.
- Yeah.

09:25.913 --> 09:29.786
- No. No.

09:32.310 --> 09:33.834
- Clear.

09:33.877 --> 09:36.880
- Clear.
Roman.

09:42.233 --> 09:43.713
Now we're clear.

09:43.757 --> 09:46.194
- Might as well start in here.
- Okay.

09:50.372 --> 09:52.026
- You okay?

09:52.069 --> 09:54.028
- Yeah.

09:54.071 --> 09:55.856
- What happened on the job?
Injury?

09:55.899 --> 09:57.684
- Sex trafficking case.

09:57.727 --> 09:59.599
I went in without backup,
I got worked.

09:59.642 --> 10:01.078
- You lose a victim?

10:01.122 --> 10:04.429
The PO at 21 said,
"Sorry for your loss."

10:04.473 --> 10:06.257
- Ruzek and I got together,
I got pregnant,

10:06.301 --> 10:07.650
and I'm not anymore.

10:07.694 --> 10:09.217
- What?

10:12.133 --> 10:14.657
Oh, I'm sorry.
I-I can't even imagine.

10:14.701 --> 10:17.486
- It's okay. It was early.
It was an unplanned pregnancy.

10:17.529 --> 10:19.140
I'm fine.

10:33.241 --> 10:35.547
- Look at this.

10:35.591 --> 10:37.114
It's the Southside Hustlers'
emblem.

10:37.158 --> 10:38.638
- Yeah, you said Logan was
getting asylum

10:38.681 --> 10:40.857
from them, right?

10:40.901 --> 10:42.424
- Looks like an oxy pill.

10:42.467 --> 10:44.644
- Let's hope it's one
of the fake ones.

10:53.043 --> 10:56.090
- Kim.
That's Sarah's.

10:56.133 --> 10:58.005
- What?

11:02.313 --> 11:04.359
Sure?
- Yeah, it's her jacket.

11:04.402 --> 11:07.231
- Okay.
Sarah?

11:07.275 --> 11:09.277
- Sarah!
- Sarah?

11:09.320 --> 11:11.366
- Sarah!
- Sarah--

11:11.409 --> 11:13.237
- Sarah!

11:23.508 --> 11:24.858
Sarah.

12:26.746 --> 12:30.140
- I believe Sarah died
a week ago.

12:30.184 --> 12:35.537
Her body indicates
she struggled to survive.

12:35.580 --> 12:37.713
Someone strangled her,
beat her.

12:37.757 --> 12:41.848
There's presence of internal
bleeding in her stomach.

12:41.891 --> 12:46.635
But none of those factors
are the actual cause of death.

12:46.678 --> 12:48.680
It's likely she appeared dead
to her assailant

12:48.724 --> 12:52.467
but survived these injuries.

12:52.510 --> 12:55.426
Ultimately,
she froze to death.

12:57.951 --> 12:59.561
- Your body tricks you
when you freeze.

12:59.604 --> 13:01.563
You think you're warm.

13:01.606 --> 13:03.957
Probable she took off her
jacket trying to cool down,

13:04.000 --> 13:09.092
went to the water and--
- How long?

13:09.136 --> 13:12.139
How long was she alone outside?

13:12.182 --> 13:16.360
- I would guess she was alive
outside for around 19 hours.

13:29.983 --> 13:33.029
- Sean.

13:33.073 --> 13:34.596
Kim?

13:39.949 --> 13:41.472
Sean?

13:42.473 --> 13:43.953
What's going on?

13:52.962 --> 13:54.007
Sean.

13:54.050 --> 13:56.661
- We found Sarah's body, Mom.

13:58.272 --> 14:00.230
She died a week ago.

14:00.274 --> 14:02.232
- No.

14:02.276 --> 14:03.843
- She's gone.

14:07.150 --> 14:09.196
- No, no.

14:09.239 --> 14:11.154
- No!
- She needed you!

14:11.198 --> 14:12.939
- No, no, no, no.
- We needed you!

14:12.982 --> 14:15.158
- Please, please stop, please.

14:15.202 --> 14:18.858
- You all right? You all right?
- I'm fine!

14:32.697 --> 14:34.699
- How'd it go
with Roman's family?

14:34.743 --> 14:36.919
- It went.
- All right, M.E. confirmed it.

14:36.963 --> 14:38.965
DNA found under
Sarah's fingernails

14:39.008 --> 14:40.053
popped in the system.

14:40.096 --> 14:41.837
It was Logan's.

14:41.881 --> 14:44.231
- All right, somebody tell me
we got something on this prick.

14:44.274 --> 14:46.668
- We ran the pill we found
at the lake house through ISP.

14:46.711 --> 14:48.931
They did confirm that it
matches our ODs,

14:48.975 --> 14:50.193
but it ain't Mexican oxy.

14:50.237 --> 14:51.716
That pill is way too sloppy
for the cartels.

14:51.760 --> 14:53.327
ISP believes it's homemade.

14:53.370 --> 14:54.981
- Might have something.

14:55.024 --> 14:56.547
Reran Logan's GPS stats.

14:56.591 --> 14:58.854
The tower pings up against
known Southside Hustler

14:58.898 --> 14:59.681
hot spots.

14:59.724 --> 15:00.987
One hit an old stash house

15:01.030 --> 15:02.336
leased to a Leon Miller.

15:02.379 --> 15:03.641
Guy's a bit of a heavy.

15:03.685 --> 15:05.948
Known for leasing dope corners.

15:05.992 --> 15:07.863
It's a long shot,
but that stretch of the city

15:07.907 --> 15:09.734
is dead man's land.
There ain't nothing there.

15:09.778 --> 15:11.475
- I mean, it's a damn good
place to hide out.

15:11.519 --> 15:14.348
- Yeah. Let's roll on it.
Nice work.

15:14.391 --> 15:15.915
- Thanks.

15:24.924 --> 15:26.186
- All right, we'll take front,
you guys--

15:27.752 --> 15:30.320
- 5021 Frank,
we got shots fired

15:30.364 --> 15:32.844
coming from inside a warehouse
at 1600 West Racine.

15:32.888 --> 15:34.368
Get us some cars over here.

15:34.411 --> 15:35.673
- Copy that.

15:35.717 --> 15:37.719
Go, go, go.

15:54.605 --> 15:56.651
- Hold on, hold on.

15:59.132 --> 16:00.611
Body.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.137
- Crossing.

16:06.400 --> 16:08.576
- Ruz, you good?

16:08.619 --> 16:12.014
- Yeah, I'm good.
We got Logan Peters.

16:12.058 --> 16:14.408
DOA, looks like gunshot wounds
to the chest.

16:18.238 --> 16:19.979
- Cross.

16:40.608 --> 16:42.958
- Hey.

16:43.002 --> 16:45.265
- Rear, possibly side
of the building.

16:45.308 --> 16:46.657
- Copy that.

16:59.931 --> 17:02.804
- Chicago PD!
Don't move!

17:02.847 --> 17:04.545
Don't move.

17:04.588 --> 17:06.025
Where's the gun?
You got the gun?

17:06.068 --> 17:07.461
- I don't know, I don't see it.
I don't see it.

17:07.504 --> 17:09.811
Buddy, where's the gun?

17:09.854 --> 17:11.856
He's foaming at the mouth.
- What is he, an OD?

17:11.900 --> 17:13.597
- I don't know, you got Narcan?
- No.

17:13.641 --> 17:16.122
- Oh, God.
- 5021 George, emergency.

17:16.165 --> 17:18.602
Roll an ambo to 1600 West
Racine, we got an OD victim.

17:18.646 --> 17:20.126
Nonresponsive.
Advise responding to set up

17:20.169 --> 17:21.431
a four-block perimeter.
We still might have

17:21.475 --> 17:22.911
a shooter here.

17:28.351 --> 17:30.136
- His pulse is strong.

17:30.179 --> 17:31.224
Let's get that Narcan
or we're going lose him.

17:31.267 --> 17:33.356
- Yup. Stay with us.
- Here you go.

17:33.400 --> 17:35.837
- Come on, come on.
- Come on, come on, come on.

17:37.360 --> 17:39.101
- There you go.
There we go, that's it.

17:39.145 --> 17:40.885
- Okay, let's get going.

17:40.929 --> 17:41.799
- Whoa, whoa.
- Easy, easy.

17:43.192 --> 17:45.281
- I gotta get his gloves
checked for GSR.

17:45.325 --> 17:46.500
- We've really gotta get him
to the hospital.

17:46.543 --> 17:49.459
- All right. Can we go?
- Yup.

17:49.503 --> 17:52.375
- It's hard to imagine this
guy's capable of firing a gun.

17:52.419 --> 17:53.724
- Looks that way,
but you never know.

17:53.768 --> 17:55.944
- Right behind y'all.
- One, two, three.

17:55.987 --> 17:58.816
Okay, all right, drop him.

17:58.860 --> 18:00.122
- What can I do?

18:00.166 --> 18:01.384
- Buckle him.
- Got it.

18:01.428 --> 18:03.604
- Hey, how's Roman?
Is he doing okay?

18:03.647 --> 18:05.345
- He's tough.
Losing his sister like that.

18:05.388 --> 18:09.392
It's hard to accept.
- Yeah, more like impossible.

18:11.177 --> 18:12.352
- You get the other guy to Med?

18:12.395 --> 18:13.483
- Yeah.

18:13.527 --> 18:15.355
Looks like Logan
was hiding out here.

18:15.398 --> 18:17.661
- Yeah, well,
someone found him.

18:17.705 --> 18:19.620
- He's got plenty
of self defense wounds,

18:19.663 --> 18:21.796
bruising on his knuckles.
Looks like he was in quite

18:21.839 --> 18:23.145
the scrape before he got shot.

18:23.189 --> 18:24.842
- Logan's getting a lot
of heat for the ODs,

18:24.886 --> 18:26.322
supplier gets spooked.

18:26.366 --> 18:28.150
Beats him, kills him,
ties it off.

18:28.194 --> 18:29.673
- Do you want us
to work this, Sarge,

18:29.717 --> 18:31.675
or do you wanna wait for
Homicide? They're on their way.

18:31.719 --> 18:34.504
- Well, if this punk's murder
can get us to our supplier,

18:34.548 --> 18:38.117
get these pills off the street,
yeah, we'll work it.

18:38.160 --> 18:41.511
I mean, for that.
Not for this.

18:50.390 --> 18:53.828
- Why do you still have
that sonogram up, Adam?

18:53.871 --> 18:58.093
- I don't know. Just couldn't
get rid of it yet.

19:01.227 --> 19:03.403
- That doesn't really
make sense, but okay.

19:03.446 --> 19:05.535
- It does to me.

19:05.579 --> 19:06.884
- Look, I'm not trying
to weird you out.

19:06.928 --> 19:08.408
I'll take it down right now
if you want me to.

19:08.451 --> 19:10.061
- No, if you want to keep
it up, that's your call.

19:10.105 --> 19:11.367
- You sure?
- Yeah, you do

19:11.411 --> 19:12.847
what you need to do.
- 'Cause, you know,

19:12.890 --> 19:15.154
I don't know if we're in
the same place with all this.

19:15.197 --> 19:17.156
We haven't really
had a chance to talk.

19:19.767 --> 19:21.508
- Okay, let's do it.
Let's talk. Let's talk.

19:21.551 --> 19:24.163
- No, no, no, we don't have--
- No, we should because

19:24.206 --> 19:26.643
it's better than us avoiding
each other and--

19:26.687 --> 19:28.428
You just--you just go ahead,

19:28.471 --> 19:31.561
you say what you're gonna say,
and you get it off your chest.

19:33.911 --> 19:37.001
- Okay. What am I meant
to get off my chest?

19:37.045 --> 19:40.570
- Your feelings, your anger.
- What do you mean?

19:43.443 --> 19:45.880
- Adam, I can tell--
I can feel it.

19:45.923 --> 19:47.360
You blame me
for losing the baby.

19:47.403 --> 19:49.579
- Blame you?
- Yeah.

19:49.623 --> 19:51.494
- I don't blame you.
What are you talking about?

19:51.538 --> 19:53.279
- 'Cause I wasn't supposed
to be in the field,

19:53.322 --> 19:54.889
I wasn't supposed
to be at the motel--

19:54.932 --> 19:57.413
- And you were. And because you
were, you saved a kid's life.

19:57.457 --> 19:58.849
- Yeah, but I could've waited
three minutes--

19:58.893 --> 20:00.329
- No, you couldn't have.
That man would've beat

20:00.373 --> 20:02.549
that girl to death,
had you waited outside.

20:02.592 --> 20:04.768
Kim, you were doing your job.
You're a cop.

20:04.812 --> 20:06.944
You were at a scene--
- I wasn't supposed to be

20:06.988 --> 20:08.294
on the scene!

20:08.337 --> 20:09.730
I wasn't supposed
to be in the motel!

20:09.773 --> 20:11.819
I wasn't supposed
to lose the baby!

20:11.862 --> 20:14.125
Don't you get that?
I don't want pity.

20:14.169 --> 20:16.127
And I don't want support.

20:19.609 --> 20:21.611
- What do you want?
- I want you to be angry

20:21.655 --> 20:24.571
with me,
as angry with me as I am.

20:28.183 --> 20:30.403
- I can't do that.

20:38.324 --> 20:40.804
I'm sorry.

20:42.719 --> 20:44.417
- Yes, okay.

20:45.679 --> 20:47.985
Got it.

20:48.029 --> 20:50.292
Okay, yes, thank you.

20:50.336 --> 20:52.468
GSR on the junkie is negative.

20:52.512 --> 20:54.818
- Dude ain't no killer,
just a stone cold addict.

20:54.862 --> 20:58.169
I just talked to him at Med.
Good news is he's stable.

20:58.213 --> 20:59.780
Bad news is he didn't
see a damn thing.

20:59.823 --> 21:02.391
He said as soon as he heard
the shots, ran off scared.

21:02.435 --> 21:04.567
- All right, so what do we
got on Leon Miller?

21:04.611 --> 21:06.569
- Confirmed he's the one that's
paying rent on the warehouse.

21:06.613 --> 21:08.658
It's bad paper, but the money
traces back to him.

21:08.702 --> 21:10.530
Narcotics says that he's
well-established, smart,

21:10.573 --> 21:11.748
and strategic.
- Hmm.

21:11.792 --> 21:13.402
- He's a good fit
for Logan's supplier.

21:13.446 --> 21:15.752
- All right, so dig into it.
See if we can put him

21:15.796 --> 21:17.450
or one of his associates
at the scene.

21:17.493 --> 21:19.234
- Sarge?
- Yes?

21:19.278 --> 21:22.368
- Okay if I update Roman?
- Yeah.

21:25.893 --> 21:27.677
- We found Logan
in an abandoned warehouse.

21:27.721 --> 21:30.463
He was beaten.
Two shots to the chest.

21:30.506 --> 21:32.900
He's dead, Roman.

21:32.943 --> 21:35.990
We think that his supplier,
Leon Miller, looks good for it.

21:36.033 --> 21:38.514
He also owns the warehouse
where Logan's body was found.

21:40.560 --> 21:42.823
- Doesn't really matter now,
does it?

21:44.433 --> 21:47.044
Who cares if he's dead?

21:47.088 --> 21:50.004
She's still gone.

21:50.047 --> 21:53.703
- I know. But down the line
it could help, you know?

21:53.747 --> 21:56.358
Knowing the man responsible
for her death is gone too.

21:56.402 --> 21:57.881
- I doubt it.

21:57.925 --> 22:01.363
- Sean, it's not on you.
This is on Logan.

22:01.407 --> 22:03.539
- What's not?
That I left her?

22:03.583 --> 22:06.803
- No--
- My sister needed me, Kim.

22:06.847 --> 22:08.675
She was coming apart,
and she needed me to just

22:08.718 --> 22:12.896
get on the plane
and come home to her.

22:12.940 --> 22:15.508
But I didn't.

22:15.551 --> 22:18.554
So you can give me
any platitudes you want

22:18.598 --> 22:21.122
but you didn't want to hear
them from me, okay?

22:21.165 --> 22:23.429
And I don't want to hear
them from you.

22:26.780 --> 22:28.390
This is on me.

22:35.310 --> 22:36.355
- Yeah.

22:36.398 --> 22:37.399
- Yeah, I'm not sure--
- Jay?

22:37.443 --> 22:38.922
- Yeah?
- Any new leads?

22:38.966 --> 22:41.360
- No. We can prove that they
knew each other from texts,

22:41.403 --> 22:42.883
social media, but there's
no tower pings,

22:42.926 --> 22:44.580
there's no footage, nothing
that puts Miller or anyone

22:44.624 --> 22:47.670
associated with him
near Logan's murder.

22:47.714 --> 22:49.063
- Guys.

22:49.106 --> 22:51.326
- Who was that?
- He's a potential witness.

22:51.370 --> 22:53.459
He says he was near the crime
scene, saw a black Range Rover

22:53.502 --> 22:55.330
speed away a minute
after hearing two gunshots.

22:55.374 --> 22:56.636
- That's the lead we've
been waiting for.

22:56.679 --> 22:58.072
Miller drives
a black Range Rover.

22:58.115 --> 23:00.553
- Yeah. He also got a partial
plate. Time to move.

23:13.174 --> 23:14.697
- Go.

23:14.741 --> 23:16.786
- Ready?
- Yeah, let's go.

23:18.222 --> 23:20.007
- Police!
Gun!

23:22.488 --> 23:23.576
- I got you.
Move up.

23:23.619 --> 23:24.620
Move up, move up.
- Come on, come on.

23:24.664 --> 23:28.450
Shots fired at the police.
- Gun!

23:28.494 --> 23:29.756
- Go, Burgess, go Burgess,
I got you.

23:29.799 --> 23:30.800
- I got you, Upton!
- Sarge, I got a runner!

23:30.844 --> 23:31.975
He's headed straight for you!

23:33.847 --> 23:35.152
Don't shoot.

23:35.196 --> 23:36.197
Don't shoot.
- Shut up, Leon.

23:36.240 --> 23:38.765
Keep your hands up.

23:38.808 --> 23:40.027
- Sarge.

23:45.162 --> 23:48.601
- Whoa.
Stand back.

24:00.047 --> 24:03.790
- Leon, we found 2,000
counterfeit oxy pills.

24:03.833 --> 24:06.053
Plus a boatload of uncut
fentanyl.

24:06.096 --> 24:08.011
- Ain't mine.

24:10.840 --> 24:14.757
- Okay, here's what
we're gonna do.

24:14.801 --> 24:17.586
I'm gonna pretend
you didn't start there.

24:21.547 --> 24:23.940
- And you're gonna pretend
you give a damn your pills

24:23.984 --> 24:25.725
killed three teenagers.

24:25.768 --> 24:27.248
- It ain't mine.

24:27.291 --> 24:29.555
You can't connect me
to none of that.

24:29.598 --> 24:31.382
I ain't never seen
or touched those drugs--

24:31.426 --> 24:36.039
- Kid, you tell your lawyer
to play that.

24:36.083 --> 24:38.564
I promise you it ain't gonna
work for the murder.

24:38.607 --> 24:41.392
- Murder? What the hell
is you talking about?

24:43.786 --> 24:46.702
- Logan Peters.

24:51.881 --> 24:53.143
- I ain't kill Logan.

24:53.187 --> 24:57.844
- He was hiding out
at your warehouse.

24:57.887 --> 25:00.281
You're the only person
who knew where he was.

25:00.324 --> 25:02.501
- Look, man, I told him
he could hide out there.

25:02.544 --> 25:05.025
No way I killed him.

25:05.068 --> 25:06.722
I'll tell you whatever you want

25:06.766 --> 25:09.203
on that,
but I ain't kill nobody.

25:09.246 --> 25:11.597
I ain't been at
that warehouse in years.

25:16.645 --> 25:18.560
- We got Miller on tape
eating at Frank's Grill

25:18.604 --> 25:21.607
over on Marquette
from 12:31 to 2:18.

25:21.650 --> 25:23.522
Son of a bitch
is telling the truth.

25:23.565 --> 25:25.219
- Well, maybe he didn't
pull the trigger himself,

25:25.262 --> 25:27.482
doesn't mean he didn't
order the hit.

25:27.526 --> 25:29.092
Keep looking.
- Hey, we finally caught

25:29.136 --> 25:31.573
a break with a bus cam.
He was passing Racine,

25:31.617 --> 25:35.142
two blocks out, three minutes
after the gunshots.

25:35.185 --> 25:37.623
Caught this blue Nissan sedan
driving westbound.

25:37.666 --> 25:39.450
Unfortunately, because
of the glare on the windows,

25:39.494 --> 25:41.540
you can't make out the driver.
- And the black Range Rover?

25:41.583 --> 25:44.281
- No, it's just
the blue Nissan, no plates.

25:48.372 --> 25:52.681
- Okay, so we start looking
for owners of blue Nissans.

25:52.725 --> 25:54.378
Hey, Kim.
- Yeah?

25:54.422 --> 25:57.556
- Talk to that witness again,
maybe he saw a blue Nissan too.

25:57.599 --> 25:59.601
- Copy you.

25:59.645 --> 26:01.603
Did you see any other cars,
anybody else?

26:01.647 --> 26:03.605
- Uh, no, only saw
a black Range Rover.

26:03.649 --> 26:05.476
- Okay, did you get a look
at the driver?

26:05.520 --> 26:09.437
- No, just the car.
- And which way was it headed?

26:09.480 --> 26:10.525
- Not sure.

26:10.569 --> 26:12.440
I was driving
to my sister's house,

26:12.483 --> 26:15.748
thought my tire was flat,
pulled over, checked the tire,

26:15.791 --> 26:17.532
heard two gunshots.

26:17.576 --> 26:20.666
- And then what?
- Got the hell out of there.

26:20.709 --> 26:22.668
- What happened to the flat?

26:22.711 --> 26:25.627
- Wasn't as bad as I thought.

26:25.671 --> 26:27.977
- Oh.

26:28.021 --> 26:29.849
Where does your sister live?

26:29.892 --> 26:32.242
- In Englewood.
Lancaster Road.

26:32.286 --> 26:35.289
- And where were you
coming from?

26:35.332 --> 26:38.945
- Uh, I was at home.
In Pilsen.

26:38.988 --> 26:41.643
- Okay. Question.

26:41.687 --> 26:45.647
See, Pilsen is here,
and Englewood is here,

26:45.691 --> 26:47.257
and the location of the
warehouse where the shooting

26:47.301 --> 26:49.825
took place is about here.

26:49.869 --> 26:53.220
Now, the shortest distance
between two points

26:53.263 --> 26:55.962
is a straight line.

26:56.005 --> 26:57.920
That line ain't
too straight, Christian.

26:57.964 --> 26:59.008
- I'm not so good
at directions.

26:59.052 --> 27:00.836
- Not so good at lying, either.

27:04.710 --> 27:07.234
- Anything else?

27:07.277 --> 27:08.801
- Why are you lying
to me, Christian?

27:08.844 --> 27:12.108
- I ain't lying to you.

27:12.152 --> 27:14.415
I told you exactly
what happened.

27:14.458 --> 27:17.200
You know what?
I don't need this.

27:24.077 --> 27:26.470
- Platt.
I need you to do a deep dive

27:26.514 --> 27:29.648
on that witness,
Christian Lewis.

27:29.691 --> 27:31.562
I'm not handing out work.
I just need this done

27:31.606 --> 27:33.434
off the record.
- Okay, fine.

27:33.477 --> 27:35.349
- Thank you.

27:35.392 --> 27:37.177
- You guys are fishing
in the wrong pond here.

27:37.220 --> 27:39.222
Hit men do not drive Nissans.

27:39.266 --> 27:41.485
- Exactly why
a smart one would.

27:41.529 --> 27:43.096
- Hey, we have anything?
- I don't know.

27:43.139 --> 27:46.360
I got three accountants, two
teachers, and a dentist, so...

27:46.403 --> 27:49.537
- Hold on, Ruz,
I think got one.

27:49.580 --> 27:52.714
Robert Harper, age 43.
White as hell.

27:52.758 --> 27:54.803
I mean, makes Halstead
look like Lil Wayne.

27:54.847 --> 27:56.500
This man is very legit.

27:56.544 --> 27:58.720
He's got three outstanding
parking tickets.

27:58.764 --> 28:02.071
And if that's not gangster,
he's got a jaywalking citation.

28:02.115 --> 28:04.595
I say we grab his ass up.

28:09.818 --> 28:11.167
- Where are you going?
You just got here.

28:23.179 --> 28:26.095
- Hey.
Uh, it turns out your witness,

28:26.139 --> 28:28.271
Christian Lewis,
used to be an informant.

28:28.315 --> 28:31.579
He was on our books
for a couple years.

28:31.622 --> 28:34.451
- When?
- 2014 to '16.

28:36.889 --> 28:39.152
I don't know what's going on,
I don't wanna know

28:39.195 --> 28:42.808
what's going on, but you're
making me nervous.

28:42.851 --> 28:45.767
- Oh, I'm fine.

28:45.811 --> 28:48.901
- You like it here, right?
- Of course I like it here.

28:48.944 --> 28:51.599
- Then be careful.

28:51.642 --> 28:56.386
Keeping secrets from Voight
is not a game many people win.

29:02.566 --> 29:06.309
Kim, you know
you're not alone in this.

29:06.353 --> 29:09.051
You got people. Me.

29:09.095 --> 29:12.620
People tend to lighten
the load.

29:26.634 --> 29:28.679
- Hey, what's up?
It's almost midnight.

29:28.723 --> 29:32.553
- We need to talk, now.
Here, someplace else.

29:32.596 --> 29:35.251
- Come on in.
- Thanks.

29:37.514 --> 29:39.255
- Yeah, my parents
are finally sleeping.

29:39.299 --> 29:40.996
The doctor gave them
some sleeping pills.

29:41.040 --> 29:42.737
- Good.
That's good.

29:42.781 --> 29:44.478
- So what's going on?
- I wanted to talk to you

29:44.521 --> 29:47.655
before too many people
got involved.

29:47.698 --> 29:49.222
- What's that mean?
- It means that things are

29:49.265 --> 29:53.922
starting to break a certain
way in Logan's murder, Sean.

29:53.966 --> 29:57.360
- What way is that, Kim?
- In a way that points to you.

30:00.363 --> 30:01.669
Our key witness,
Christian Lewis,

30:01.712 --> 30:02.931
the guy who saw
a black Range Rover--

30:02.975 --> 30:06.282
the exact car
that Leon Miller drives--

30:06.326 --> 30:08.763
is one of your old CIs.

30:10.939 --> 30:12.854
And the car that was actually
at the scene, a blue Nissan,

30:12.898 --> 30:15.770
just so happens
to be the same type of car

30:15.814 --> 30:19.600
that your cousin,
Tamra Riley, drives.

30:19.643 --> 30:21.994
I've met her, Sean,
at your house, at parties.

30:22.037 --> 30:25.301
I've met her,
and according to social media,

30:25.345 --> 30:26.868
she has been in Florida
the last five days--

30:26.912 --> 30:29.392
- It's late, and I need to get
ready for my sister's funeral.

30:29.436 --> 30:30.785
- Sean, I don't think
you meant to kill him--

30:30.829 --> 30:32.439
- I'm giving the eulogy,
and I wanna make sure I do

30:32.482 --> 30:34.354
a good job, Kim.
- Sean.

30:37.096 --> 30:40.055
- I appreciate you coming by.

30:46.018 --> 30:47.715
- Get some rest, Sean.

30:57.856 --> 30:59.553
- Where we at?

30:59.596 --> 31:01.076
We find any blue Nissan owners
with a connection

31:01.120 --> 31:03.557
to Leon Miller or the DOA?
- So we went through all of

31:03.600 --> 31:06.125
Miller's known associates.
Nobody drives a blue Nissan.

31:06.168 --> 31:09.171
- So, other than the car,
the only piece of evidence

31:09.215 --> 31:11.695
we got is this witness,
Christian Lewis.

31:11.739 --> 31:13.523
Who popped up out of nowhere

31:13.567 --> 31:16.352
and luckily saw a black Range
Rover speed from the scene.

31:16.396 --> 31:18.615
- Maybe Miller let
one of his associates

31:18.659 --> 31:20.661
drive the Range Rover
to do the hit.

31:20.704 --> 31:24.056
- It's possible, but Miller
seems smarter than that.

31:24.099 --> 31:26.188
- So that leaves you--
the killer drives the exact

31:26.232 --> 31:28.364
same car as Miller,
with similar plates.

31:28.408 --> 31:29.888
- Or witness is lying
his ass off.

31:29.931 --> 31:31.019
- Mm-hmm.
- All right, Kim,

31:31.063 --> 31:33.587
you talked to the
witness yesterday.

31:33.630 --> 31:36.372
He seem credible to you?

31:36.416 --> 31:39.810
- Um, you know, I-I couldn't
tell that he was lying,

31:39.854 --> 31:43.553
but his story did have
some holes in it.

31:43.597 --> 31:45.120
- Bring him in.

31:52.780 --> 31:55.348
- We got open door.

31:57.872 --> 32:00.570
Chicago PD.

32:03.138 --> 32:06.185
- Christian Lewis.
Chicago PD.

32:11.973 --> 32:13.627
- What the hell?

32:13.670 --> 32:15.455
- Lewis packed up fast.

32:15.498 --> 32:17.370
- He's gotta be playing us.
Made up the Range Rover

32:17.413 --> 32:19.720
to get us to focus the
investigation on Miller.

32:19.763 --> 32:21.113
Why do that?

32:21.156 --> 32:23.289
- 'Cause someone pays you to.

32:26.509 --> 32:28.424
Let's go knock on some doors.

32:34.126 --> 32:36.693
Good afternoon, sir, I was
hoping you could help me out.

32:36.737 --> 32:37.651
Thanks so deeply
for your concern

32:37.694 --> 32:38.695
about the city of Chicago.

32:38.739 --> 32:39.783
- No, no, no, what I'm saying

32:39.827 --> 32:41.263
is Christian is a good dude.

32:41.307 --> 32:42.699
I mean, he ain't gonna
run for president,

32:42.743 --> 32:44.092
but he's doing the best he can.

32:44.136 --> 32:45.354
- Well, what do you
mean by that?

32:45.398 --> 32:47.661
- He's an addict.
Heroin, crack, you name it.

32:47.704 --> 32:49.924
But he's been getting himself
right, going to meetings,

32:49.968 --> 32:51.273
making amends.

32:51.317 --> 32:53.145
Landlady say he just
gave her an envelope

32:53.188 --> 32:54.885
filled with fresh hundreds.
- This landlady,

32:54.929 --> 32:58.106
she live in the complex?
- Yeah. Apartment 2C.

33:01.762 --> 33:04.634
- How's it going?
Any leads?

33:04.678 --> 33:08.116
- Uh, best one I have so far is
Lewis is trying to make amends.

33:08.160 --> 33:09.639
- Uh-huh.
- He just handed the landlady

33:09.683 --> 33:11.511
an envelope full of cash.
- Yeah, I just talked to her.

33:11.554 --> 33:13.904
- Okay.
- Lewis gave her three grand

33:13.948 --> 33:15.471
in cash,
squared up his whole debt.

33:15.515 --> 33:16.907
- Hmm.

33:16.951 --> 33:21.651
- Fresh cash, too, so we can
trace the serial numbers.

33:21.695 --> 33:23.175
- That's good.

33:23.218 --> 33:27.048
- Yeah, we identify the bank
where the money was withdrawn,

33:27.092 --> 33:30.617
I'm guessing that'll get us to
the guy who paid Lewis to lie.

33:30.660 --> 33:31.792
- Mm.

33:31.835 --> 33:33.533
- Unless, of course,
you already know.

33:36.101 --> 33:40.409
- No. I-I'm just doing
the math, like you.

33:43.717 --> 33:46.372
Do you want me to run the cash?
- No, I got it.

33:46.415 --> 33:48.026
- Okay.

33:52.465 --> 33:55.903
Funeral for Roman's sister
is in a few hours.

33:55.946 --> 33:57.992
- You should go.

33:58.036 --> 34:00.081
Go.
- Okay.

34:27.935 --> 34:29.328
- Good morning, everybody.

34:29.371 --> 34:31.895
On behalf of the Roman family,

34:31.939 --> 34:36.248
I would like to thank you all
for being here today.

34:36.291 --> 34:42.036
I'd like to start with
a reading from Ecclesiastes.

34:42.080 --> 34:45.431
"My child, when you come
to serve the Lord,

34:45.474 --> 34:49.391
"prepare yourself for trials.
Be sincere of heart

34:49.435 --> 34:52.307
"and steadfast,
and do not be impetuous

34:52.351 --> 34:54.483
"in times of adversity.

34:54.527 --> 34:57.269
"Cling to him,
do not leave him,

34:57.312 --> 35:00.837
"that you may prosper
in your last days.

35:00.881 --> 35:03.275
"Accept whatever
happens to you;

35:03.318 --> 35:07.583
"in periods of humiliation,
be patient.

35:07.627 --> 35:10.978
"For in fire gold is tested,
and the chosen,

35:11.021 --> 35:14.373
"in the crucible
of humiliation.

35:14.416 --> 35:18.072
"Trust in God,
and he will help you;

35:18.116 --> 35:23.121
make your ways straight
and hope in him."

35:23.164 --> 35:24.774
Word of the Lord.

35:24.818 --> 35:26.994
all: Thanks be to God.

35:31.912 --> 35:33.653
- I love you.

35:37.222 --> 35:39.702
- Did the right thing
to call me.

35:50.539 --> 35:56.154
- My sister Sarah,
she died alone in a ditch.

35:56.197 --> 36:00.941
Temperature
was minus-4 degrees.

36:00.984 --> 36:05.641
Can only imagine
how scared she was.

36:05.685 --> 36:07.643
How alone she was.

36:10.211 --> 36:12.170
Growing up...

36:12.213 --> 36:14.476
My sister was never alone.

36:14.520 --> 36:18.567
Uh, she was always surrounded
by her friends,

36:18.611 --> 36:21.309
cousins,
kids from down the block,

36:21.353 --> 36:24.921
kids I didn't even know
where the hell--

36:24.965 --> 36:27.272
heck they came from.

36:27.315 --> 36:29.796
You know,
they'd just be there,

36:29.839 --> 36:31.580
in the kitchen one day,
drinking pop out of

36:31.624 --> 36:34.888
a two liter,
waiting for my sister.

36:34.931 --> 36:40.763
She drew people to her
because she was warm.

36:40.807 --> 36:45.942
She was loving,
and she was always herself.

36:45.986 --> 36:49.903
Strong and stubborn.

36:49.946 --> 36:54.168
She was a fighter.

36:54.212 --> 36:57.737
When they found her...

36:57.780 --> 37:01.349
My sister had scratches

37:01.393 --> 37:04.700
on her hands and knees
from crawling,

37:04.744 --> 37:08.269
from fighting.

37:08.313 --> 37:12.447
But there was no one there
to save her.

37:12.491 --> 37:17.235
She screamed for help,
but no one heard her.

37:17.278 --> 37:20.194
She was screaming weeks before.

37:22.849 --> 37:25.068
Sarah needed help.

37:29.377 --> 37:32.902
But I wasn't there for her.

37:36.341 --> 37:38.299
"Whoever conceals
his transgressions

37:38.343 --> 37:39.735
will not prosper."

37:41.041 --> 37:43.304
"But he who confesses

37:43.348 --> 37:45.306
and forsakes them
will obtain mercy."

37:45.350 --> 37:49.528
Proverbs 28:13.

37:49.571 --> 37:52.487
If you ask me, that's a lie.

37:52.531 --> 37:57.362
You can't just recite a
passage, say a few Hail Marys,

37:57.405 --> 38:00.234
and then wash away your sins.

38:00.278 --> 38:03.281
And we shouldn't be able to.

38:03.324 --> 38:06.284
We should be required
to carry around our sins

38:06.327 --> 38:09.374
for the rest of our years.

38:09.417 --> 38:13.769
All the pain and guilt too.

38:13.813 --> 38:16.424
We need to feel them

38:16.468 --> 38:21.168
so we can do better next time.

38:21.211 --> 38:22.865
So that we can be there
the next time

38:22.909 --> 38:26.129
someone screams for help.

38:52.373 --> 38:54.723
- That was a hell of a eulogy.
- It was honest.

38:54.767 --> 38:56.464
- Hmm.

38:59.119 --> 39:01.295
- You believe in absolution?

39:05.473 --> 39:08.346
- Kim, I don't think like that.

39:08.389 --> 39:12.480
- Yeah, I know.

39:12.524 --> 39:15.527
- I appreciate you waiting
till the service was over.

39:18.399 --> 39:21.228
So how we gonna do this?

39:28.061 --> 39:29.802
- We're not.

39:34.894 --> 39:39.115
Logan Peters deserved
what he got.

39:39.159 --> 39:42.597
As for the person
responsible...

39:42.641 --> 39:44.512
Well, we're gonna continue
our investigation,

39:44.556 --> 39:47.385
but it's no longer
a top priority.

39:50.953 --> 39:53.434
I mean, we'll keep you--

39:53.478 --> 39:55.393
keep you posted with
any new information,

39:55.436 --> 39:58.308
but other than that...

40:02.922 --> 40:05.751
I wish you the best.

40:10.190 --> 40:13.280
- What just happened?

40:14.455 --> 40:16.892
- I-I don't know.

40:21.941 --> 40:23.595
- Sean.

40:25.205 --> 40:27.425
I think you're right.

40:30.123 --> 40:33.779
Maybe we should be required
to carry this pain...

40:35.781 --> 40:39.437
But then don't we get to
decide what we do with it?
