00:03.597 --> 00:05.108
Hey, Red, I've got a question for you.

00:05.869 --> 00:08.105
My wife says she doesn't want
anything for Valentine's day.

00:08.280 --> 00:09.429
So I'm off the hook, right?

00:12.577 --> 00:13.826
Let me tell you a little story.

00:16.449 --> 00:18.347
There was a woman, a newly-wed.

00:19.171 --> 00:20.598
And she told her husband,

00:21.010 --> 00:23.158
rather then waste money on gifts,

00:23.308 --> 00:24.931
save for retirement.

00:25.693 --> 00:27.117
And so he never bought her a gift.

00:27.754 --> 00:29.939
Not for Christmas, birthdays...never.

00:30.863 --> 00:32.216
And 50 years later,

00:32.890 --> 00:33.952
she thanked him.

00:35.001 --> 00:36.599
And you know who that woman was?

00:37.448 --> 00:37.910
No.

00:38.298 --> 00:39.147
That woman ...

00:39.596 --> 00:43.607
was the invisible dancing fairy of dumb-ass land!

00:46.904 --> 00:48.889
All women want gifts.

00:50.603 --> 00:51.614
Well ...

00:52.276 --> 00:54.099
what do you get a stripper anyway?

00:55.735 --> 00:58.708
Oh, how about a robe
and a father who gave a damn?

01:00.721 --> 01:02.769
Mrs. Forman, life's a trade off.

01:02.907 --> 01:06.403
If her father gave a damn,
I wouldn't have this smile on my face.

01:08.027 --> 01:09.038
Well Steven,

01:09.229 --> 01:12.239
it is important to keep romance alive
once you're married.

01:12.826 --> 01:15.898
That's why I bought a present for Red
and I'm sure he has one for me.

01:15.899 --> 01:18.995
Because he loves me and
he knows what I'm capable of.

01:21.146 --> 01:23.781
That's right honey!
Wait till you see what I got you!

01:29.192 --> 01:31.290
You romantic little devil you!

01:31.577 --> 01:32.563
Not hardly.

01:32.975 --> 01:33.962
Follow me rookie.

01:37.122 --> 01:40.069
Ever since I forgot Kitty's birthday that one year,

01:40.371 --> 01:42.531
I keep a stash of gifts down here.

01:43.892 --> 01:47.152
That way, even if I forget, I remember.

01:48.866 --> 01:50.601
Go ahead, I'll spot you one.

01:52.724 --> 01:53.299
Oh hey,

01:54.235 --> 01:56.171
these woolen mittens'd be perfect for Sam.

01:56.771 --> 01:57.770
If only they were black,

01:59.046 --> 02:00.257
leather and a bra.

02:02.967 --> 02:03.879
So what are you giving Kitty?

02:03.966 --> 02:05.103
Ahh this needlepoint.

02:06.452 --> 02:08.038
She'll like it because it's fun

02:08.362 --> 02:12.238
and I'll like it because
it'll keep her occupied
for gigantic chunks of time.

02:16.758 --> 02:18.494
Jackie dear, uhh,

02:18.681 --> 02:22.903
thank you for booking that lovely couple
on our Fools For Love piece.

02:24.067 --> 02:25.678
That guy was so cute.

02:25.941 --> 02:30.374
You know he said no matter where he went.
He always heard his wife's voice saying "I love you".

02:31.246 --> 02:36.170
Well apparently another voice in his head
told him to push her off a Ferris wheel.

02:37.813 --> 02:38.724
Oh my God!

02:39.466 --> 02:40.809
Oh no no no no no, that's horrible!

02:40.855 --> 02:42.329
It's a tragedy!

02:42.630 --> 02:44.837
We don't have a couple for today's show.

02:45.982 --> 02:49.879
You've got three hours
to find another one or you're fired.

02:52.001 --> 02:54.067
Oh I'm just kidding ...

02:56.067 --> 02:57.212
No I'm not.

03:00.014 --> 03:02.446
Seriously Jackie, just kidding about firing you.

03:09.213 --> 03:10.828
Christine St. George's office.

03:10.894 --> 03:12.537
I wasn't kidding.

03:16.049 --> 03:17.993
Psssst Jackie! Come here!

03:18.641 --> 03:20.451
Ohhhh. What do you want?

03:20.526 --> 03:22.535
I wanted to say: don't worry.

03:22.536 --> 03:25.165
It'll all work out between you and Christine.

03:27.767 --> 03:28.847
Well thanks.

03:33.532 --> 03:34.996
Christine St. George's office.

03:34.997 --> 03:36.676
You're gonna get fired !

03:36.677 --> 03:38.648
You're gonna get fired !

Hey, Record Guy...

04:24.101 --> 04:25.359
Mr. Record...

04:26.669 --> 04:28.293
Mr. Record Breaker...

04:30.218 --> 04:32.922
Captain Record of the U.S.S. Phonograph.

04:34.218 --> 04:36.584
Donna, Hyde's already given me a nickname.

04:36.755 --> 04:38.304
It's Mrs. Lady-Lovely-Locks.

04:42.239 --> 04:43.046
Okay.

04:43.788 --> 04:45.487
Mrs. Locks. Uhm...

04:46.480 --> 04:48.414
I was wondering if maybe you'd like to...

04:48.452 --> 04:49.588
I don't know, like ...

04:49.992 --> 04:52.668
do something with me tonight for good old VD?

04:53.297 --> 04:54.349
Valentine's Day !

04:58.912 --> 05:00.076
Not VD!

05:01.541 --> 05:03.062
I am clean as a whistle !

05:05.335 --> 05:06.302
Man it's uh,

05:07.016 --> 05:08.255
it's really nice of you to ask but

05:08.256 --> 05:09.814
I've already got plans with someone else.

05:09.861 --> 05:10.875
Maybe a rain check.

05:11.419 --> 05:13.232
Sure. I love rain checks.

05:14.189 --> 05:16.180
In fact, I love checking for rain.

05:17.635 --> 05:18.987
I'm gonna go check for rain right now.

05:22.608 --> 05:24.499
That's the office, here's no rain in there.

05:28.180 --> 05:29.542
Clear out here too !

05:35.749 --> 05:37.158
Oh. Fez !

05:37.252 --> 05:40.285
I have to find a happy couple
for Christine to interview today or I'm fired.

05:40.670 --> 05:41.881
What about Red and Ms. Kitty?

05:43.873 --> 05:47.864
Ugggg, I might as well book that painting of the old lady
and the geezer with the pitchfork.

05:48.785 --> 05:52.043
Ah I see where you're going with this Jackie, and don't worry,

05:52.353 --> 05:55.048
if it will save your job,
I will pretend to be your boyfriend.

05:56.616 --> 05:57.734
We should probably practice.

05:57.937 --> 05:59.731
Oh ! Get off me!

05:59.759 --> 06:00.736
I was trying to help !

06:00.754 --> 06:02.219
You were trying to cop a feel !

06:02.275 --> 06:03.675
You didn't let me finish.

06:04.125 --> 06:07.440
I was trying to help ...
myself to a handful of your boob.

06:11.267 --> 06:12.084
But I would like to help.

06:12.638 --> 06:15.614
No, Fez.
If Christine finds out we're faking it, I'm fired.

06:15.971 --> 06:17.135
I can see all that, baby.

06:17.755 --> 06:18.382
Besides,

06:19.190 --> 06:20.823
interracial couples are sexy.

06:22.889 --> 06:23.866
Because it's illegal.

06:26.605 --> 06:30.239
Fez, it's not illegal
for people of two different races to date.

06:30.699 --> 06:31.188
It's not ?

06:34.174 --> 06:35.169
Freaking Hyde!

06:38.822 --> 06:39.160
Hey.

06:39.178 --> 06:39.591
Hey.

06:42.512 --> 06:46.047
Look, I just wanna make sure
you didn't get the wrong idea when I asked you out,

06:46.048 --> 06:49.015
because I was asking you out as like...as friends.

06:49.447 --> 06:51.257
Well, I'm glad you consider me a friend,

06:51.258 --> 06:53.876
cause when I said I had plans earlier,
actually I have a date.

06:55.379 --> 06:57.867
And I was thinking maybe you could help me out
and give me some advice.

06:57.923 --> 06:59.482
You know, from the female perspective.

06:59.993 --> 07:02.961
I'd ask my cousin but she's kinda into me,
it's weird.

07:04.369 --> 07:06.369
Sure, yeah. I mean what do you have planned?

07:06.857 --> 07:11.215
I was thinking ... we start sweet,
with...strawberry wine.

07:11.713 --> 07:16.060
Then, we get a tad naughty with Dirty Word Mad Libs.

07:17.056 --> 07:19.116
And then, hold on ... what's this ?

07:19.360 --> 07:22.722
Tickets to the Monster Truck Mud Mayhem!

07:24.543 --> 07:26.619
Wow Randy, that sounds like a great idea.

07:27.454 --> 07:29.941
If you're dating Granny from the Beverly Hill Billies.

07:31.574 --> 07:36.344
It's just..there is something
I don't like about the usual roses,
fancy dinner and theater tickets.

07:36.774 --> 07:37.309
It's so ...

07:38.417 --> 07:39.112
expensive.

07:41.591 --> 07:42.436
Hey Leo,

07:43.366 --> 07:44.892
what is you idea of a romantic date?

07:46.385 --> 07:47.719
November 13th.

07:50.789 --> 07:53.742
But this year is ruined, man.
I gotta go to the dentist.

07:59.546 --> 08:04.400
Well I hope you two lovebirds are ready
to tell us all about your relationship.

08:04.401 --> 08:05.424
We sure are.

08:05.489 --> 08:07.874
We've been dating so long,
we finish each other's...

08:08.513 --> 08:09.480
...Sentences.

08:10.456 --> 08:12.503
Well, I was going to say sandwiches but whatever.

08:13.546 --> 08:14.532
Okay, here we go.

08:18.614 --> 08:21.112
What's Up, Wisconsin?

08:21.835 --> 08:25.018
It's time for our annual "Fools For Love" segment

08:25.019 --> 08:26.783
and with me today

08:26.990 --> 08:32.304
is my assistant, Jackie Burkhart
and her boyfriend, Fez...

08:34.192 --> 08:36.398
How do you pronounce your last name?

08:36.707 --> 08:39.458
Oh, the first five Ks are silent.

08:41.619 --> 08:44.051
See how they look at each other!

08:44.182 --> 08:48.276
Hm. It's just the way Sonny used to look
at me while Cher was in make-up.

08:50.115 --> 08:52.950
So...tell us how you two met.

08:54.594 --> 08:55.476
Well uhm...

08:55.477 --> 08:56.986
I'll take this one baby.

08:57.662 --> 08:58.986
It was the third grade.

08:59.108 --> 09:00.817
Jackie came to school with pink-eye.

09:01.465 --> 09:03.292
All the kids teased her, so ...

09:03.508 --> 09:05.724
I rubbed her eye and infected myself.

09:06.822 --> 09:07.869
So she wouldn't be alone.

09:08.639 --> 09:10.808
I guess you can say it was love at first sight !

09:12.263 --> 09:13.662
Pink sight that is.

09:15.254 --> 09:20.691
Well I'm sure my viewers are dying to know
the secret of your happiness.

09:21.142 --> 09:22.156
It's very simple.

09:23.367 --> 09:25.104
We make out every chance we get.

09:26.804 --> 09:27.611
Kiss me baby !

09:27.612 --> 09:29.593
Nooooo! No no baby baby, I ...

09:29.932 --> 09:31.612
I have a cold sore.

09:32.542 --> 09:35.406
Well baby, that wouldn't be the first time
I got a disease from you baby.

09:36.964 --> 09:39.734
No no baby, I just...I ate some garlic bread.

09:39.847 --> 09:42.420
Oh baby that's perfect!
I just ate spaghetti, baby!

09:42.421 --> 09:43.836
Oh. Baby....

09:43.883 --> 09:44.418
Baby.

09:44.419 --> 09:44.991
Baby.

09:44.992 --> 09:45.498
Baby.

09:45.499 --> 09:46.005
Baby.

09:46.006 --> 09:46.418
BABY !

09:47.160 --> 09:48.399
Come on Jackie.

09:48.400 --> 09:51.235
Give your man a Valentine's Day kiss !

10:01.157 --> 10:03.091
Call the fire department !

10:04.283 --> 10:06.114
You can't fake passion like that.

10:07.479 --> 10:08.756
We'll be right back.

10:13.967 --> 10:16.475
Well, that was terrific.

10:16.559 --> 10:18.931
Jackie, thank you,
you acted yourself darling.

10:18.932 --> 10:23.604
And Fez ...
as usual I didn't understand a word you said.

10:27.083 --> 10:27.928
Fez ! We did it !

10:27.929 --> 10:29.731
Oh you totally saved my job.

10:29.757 --> 10:34.020
Yes. And you totally were not kidding
when you said you ate garlic bread.

10:41.834 --> 10:43.947
There's my Valentine.

10:46.181 --> 10:48.134
See, now. The card is a heart,

10:48.895 --> 10:53.208
actually it's your heart,
and it's saying: "Hi Red, remember when I attacked you?"

10:55.368 --> 10:58.204
It's a reminder to cut back on fatty fried foods.

10:59.355 --> 11:01.017
Well that's real cute.

11:01.308 --> 11:02.171
I'll tell you what,

11:02.754 --> 11:06.829
you close your eyes and start counting
and I'll be right back with your gift !

11:08.481 --> 11:08.960
1 ...

11:09.524 --> 11:10.003
2 ...

11:10.594 --> 11:11.064
3 ...

11:11.824 --> 11:12.331
4 ...

11:17.285 --> 11:18.383
What the hell !

11:22.638 --> 11:24.910
Oh Nooo !

11:26.506 --> 11:27.042
23 ...

11:27.652 --> 11:28.450
24 ...

11:28.995 --> 11:29.999
25 ...

11:30.469 --> 11:31.380
26 ...

11:32.671 --> 11:33.553
27 ...

11:33.863 --> 11:34.661
28 ...

11:35.384 --> 11:36.220
29 ...

11:36.905 --> 11:37.469
30 ...

11:37.818 --> 11:38.532
31 ...

11:39.011 --> 11:39.705
32 ...

11:40.231 --> 11:40.945
33 ...

11:58.992 --> 12:00.654
Mrs. St. George, are you okay?

12:01.396 --> 12:05.959
Yes, it's ...
this happens to me every Valentine's Day.

12:07.133 --> 12:09.063
I see a couple in love

12:09.064 --> 12:16.132
and it reminds me that I am missing the one thing
that every woman needs to feel good about herself.

12:16.761 --> 12:18.329
A friend that is fatter then you?

12:20.969 --> 12:22.031
Love !

12:22.376 --> 12:25.212
I sacrificed love for my career and

12:26.699 --> 12:29.609
sometimes I think I maybe did the wrong thing.

12:31.085 --> 12:32.795
Have a drink with me.

12:36.455 --> 12:37.179
Really?

12:37.853 --> 12:39.792
Tell me all about yourself.

12:40.479 --> 12:43.114
Who you are, what makes you tick.

12:44.900 --> 12:46.124
Well, uhm....

12:46.125 --> 12:46.661
No.

12:48.135 --> 12:49.660
Let's go back to me.

12:52.345 --> 12:54.619
I was born in a small hamlet,

12:55.181 --> 12:59.239
just outside a little place I like to call New York ...

13:02.015 --> 13:06.561
... And so I returned safely to base-camp.

13:07.723 --> 13:10.995
That half-frozen sherpa on my back.

13:12.968 --> 13:15.953
There is a famous Tibetan folksong about it.

13:18.079 --> 13:19.740
Wow. You're incredible.

13:20.190 --> 13:21.389
So are you.

13:23.249 --> 13:24.810
Here's to you dear.

13:24.999 --> 13:27.272
No. To you Ms. St. George.

13:28.246 --> 13:30.894
Well, that's what I meant.

13:32.745 --> 13:36.241
Why on God's green earth would I drink to you?

13:37.852 --> 13:39.101
You're cut off.

13:45.424 --> 13:46.310
So do I look okay?

13:46.722 --> 13:49.470
Just wanna make sure
my outfit doesn't send the wrong message to my date.

13:50.606 --> 13:52.467
Okay, what message are you trying to send?

13:53.094 --> 13:54.168
I'd like it to say :

13:54.355 --> 13:55.891
Hi, my name is Randy.

13:56.466 --> 13:58.726
I'm a fun-loving, yet slightly naughty guy.

14:00.290 --> 14:01.614
The little boy in me is insecure,

14:01.615 --> 14:02.988
but the man in me is cocky,

14:03.325 --> 14:06.409
giving me a playfully heady mix of humility

14:06.609 --> 14:07.421
and aloofness.

14:08.932 --> 14:09.631
I like you,

14:10.443 --> 14:11.117
let's party!

14:13.068 --> 14:15.690
I think you are asking
a little too much from a jacket, but ...

14:15.715 --> 14:16.315
go have fun.

14:18.313 --> 14:19.412
Okay Donna,

14:19.851 --> 14:21.099
you're Valentine's here!

14:22.638 --> 14:24.162
I thought we'd start with some Hangman,

14:24.163 --> 14:27.871
then move into something
that really gets the pulse racing like ...

14:27.872 --> 14:28.708
Yahtzee.

14:30.181 --> 14:32.941
Alright.
Just so long as when you get Yhatzee you yell Poopsie.

14:34.855 --> 14:36.366
That's not a promise I can make.

14:38.888 --> 14:40.262
Oeh, pizza !

14:44.533 --> 14:45.657
Oh. You're back.

14:46.297 --> 14:49.295
Hope your car is not blocking the driveway,
we're expecting a pizza.

14:51.542 --> 14:52.392
Donna,

14:53.116 --> 14:55.514
would you go out with me on a big Valentine's Day date?

14:57.826 --> 14:59.562
What about the other girl?

14:59.937 --> 15:00.911
There is no other girl.

15:01.635 --> 15:03.396
I just think you're hot and I want to go out with you.

15:08.993 --> 15:11.715
I'm a father and I'm standing right here!

15:14.042 --> 15:15.291
Here Mr. Pinciotti.

15:15.603 --> 15:16.427
Pizza's on me.

15:18.325 --> 15:19.911
Have her home by sunrise.

15:26.369 --> 15:27.346
Hey Kitty.

15:30.555 --> 15:31.479
Hi Red.

15:31.817 --> 15:34.152
Sorry I didn't get around to making dinner, but ...

15:34.514 --> 15:38.162
I was too busy counting to 956.

15:39.773 --> 15:41.296
Well, it's gonna be worth it,

15:41.297 --> 15:42.570
cause I found your gift.

15:45.357 --> 15:46.206
Look at that.

15:46.755 --> 15:47.605
Pack of gum.

15:48.641 --> 15:49.844
Tire gauge.

15:51.205 --> 15:52.292
Actually the gum was for me.

15:52.293 --> 15:52.691
Red !

15:54.265 --> 15:56.700
Kitty, you always said
it's the thought that counts.

15:56.750 --> 15:58.773
Oh I said that to Eric when he was five

15:58.774 --> 16:01.396
and he gave me that stupid macaroni-frame.

16:02.710 --> 16:03.360
You !

16:04.184 --> 16:05.745
What did you do ?

16:08.030 --> 16:08.805
I'm sorry Red.

16:09.417 --> 16:10.990
I was down there picking out a gift for Sam

16:11.664 --> 16:13.415
and she caught me and assumed everything was for her.

16:14.102 --> 16:15.651
And she started kissing me everywhere and...

16:16.975 --> 16:18.311
I just handed everything over to her.

16:19.622 --> 16:20.748
That's her power man.

16:22.221 --> 16:23.420
Good God Steven,

16:23.507 --> 16:24.781
the whole stash ?

16:25.094 --> 16:26.867
Look, I know I owe you an apology but

16:26.942 --> 16:27.604
can it wait ?

16:27.654 --> 16:29.917
Cause Sam just send me up here
to get some whipped cream. So....

16:33.502 --> 16:34.001
Sorry !

16:37.625 --> 16:38.062
Okay.

16:38.936 --> 16:40.272
What were you two talking about?

16:43.371 --> 16:44.545
Well Kitty ...

16:45.818 --> 16:48.591
I had a stash of gifts
down there for every occasion.

16:48.829 --> 16:50.902
That way, if I forgot to buy you something,

16:51.327 --> 16:52.576
I'd still be covered.

16:54.249 --> 16:56.088
You buy my gifts in bulk ?!

16:58.348 --> 17:00.708
Nooooo ... it's ... more of a ....

17:01.757 --> 17:03.707
vast inventory of love.

17:08.529 --> 17:09.090
Well,

17:09.491 --> 17:13.723
you're about to get
a vast inventory of my foot in your ass !

17:15.612 --> 17:18.271
Yeah ! I can do that too !

17:30.366 --> 17:31.403
Wow.

17:33.026 --> 17:35.399
So ... this was for me all along?

17:36.073 --> 17:36.535
Yeah.

17:37.372 --> 17:40.746
For one day I wanted to transform
this crappy little record store

17:41.358 --> 17:43.418
into a crappy little bistro.

17:46.741 --> 17:47.628
Thanks.

17:49.526 --> 17:53.463
So, when I asked you out,
why did you pretend to have another date ?

17:54.087 --> 17:54.637
Donna.

17:54.862 --> 17:56.897
I've wanted to ask you out for a long time.

17:57.509 --> 18:00.694
And then you kinda beat me to it
and I'm kinda of a traditional guy.

18:00.881 --> 18:02.317
I like to make the first move.

18:03.406 --> 18:06.166
But ... if you want to make the second move,

18:06.703 --> 18:08.264
well, you're in luck.

18:10.065 --> 18:11.426
I'm not wearing a bra !

18:15.922 --> 18:17.545
That's good to know.

18:25.778 --> 18:26.540
Hey !

18:27.178 --> 18:29.289
I just had the best meal !

18:31.124 --> 18:33.684
Somebody left two whole steak-dinners in there !

18:35.283 --> 18:36.759
Now if you'll excuse me,

18:37.334 --> 18:39.494
I'm off to the Monster Truck Show.

18:47.005 --> 18:47.916
Would you just listen?!

18:47.917 --> 18:49.740
Oh Red, I'd love to talk to you

18:49.741 --> 18:52.187
but I have to check the pressure in my tires!

18:56.134 --> 18:56.571
Hey Red.

18:57.270 --> 18:59.557
Kitty told Sam the presents weren't for her.

18:59.558 --> 19:00.481
Now I'm kinda in trouble.

19:00.482 --> 19:03.641
So, I got us each
a bouquet of flowers for our ladies.

19:05.766 --> 19:07.589
Kitty! I got you roses!

19:08.625 --> 19:10.299
See how it feels, dumb-ass?

19:16.248 --> 19:17.934
Jackie. Come in.

19:18.184 --> 19:18.758
Please.

19:19.894 --> 19:23.054
I just wanna thank you for yesterday.

19:23.591 --> 19:26.563
I feel we really bonded.

19:27.000 --> 19:30.887
As much as a star can bond with a commoner.

19:32.698 --> 19:34.521
Well I'm ... I'm really glad that we talked.

19:34.971 --> 19:37.006
You know, I got to see there's a real person in there.

19:37.368 --> 19:39.905
Someone with hopes and fears and emotions.

19:40.030 --> 19:42.153
Well, I'm only human.

19:43.327 --> 19:48.762
And you snuck a rare peak
behind my iron curtain didn't you?

19:50.385 --> 19:50.938
I know.

19:50.939 --> 19:52.911
You know I really feel
like I got to know you better.

19:52.961 --> 19:54.322
Yes you did.

19:54.635 --> 19:55.921
And so you're fired.

19:57.957 --> 19:58.806
Wait, what?

19:59.193 --> 20:02.964
I cannot have an employee know so much about me.

20:03.901 --> 20:07.189
And since you're TV career is finished,

20:07.190 --> 20:09.324
may I suggest bartending?

20:10.173 --> 20:12.321
You pour a mean Scotch, lady.

20:14.133 --> 20:15.669
W..no no no no. This isn't fair.

20:15.981 --> 20:17.606
I work my butt off for you.

20:17.706 --> 20:19.529
Thank you. Out you go.

20:22.239 --> 20:22.963
Go on.

20:23.688 --> 20:26.113
Okay alright you know what?
Nobody here likes you.

20:26.338 --> 20:29.298
They only pretend to like you
because you're famous.

20:29.785 --> 20:33.022
And I pretend to like them
because they bring me lunch.

20:34.845 --> 20:38.092
Oh God. Ohhh. You are a crazy bitter lady

20:38.093 --> 20:39.778
with a hole where your heart should be!

20:40.240 --> 20:42.276
Now is that supposed to hurt me?

20:42.489 --> 20:45.063
I have a mug that says that.

20:49.635 --> 20:52.558
Those shoes are so last season!

20:53.981 --> 20:56.931
Rot in hell you worthless maggot!

21:04.406 --> 21:06.079
Well I guess that's it.

21:06.129 --> 21:08.689
Awww, I promised myself I wouldn't cry.

21:08.690 --> 21:10.163
Wadda ya know, I didn't.

21:12.311 --> 21:12.785
Okay look.

21:12.786 --> 21:15.032
Christine is obviously looking
for a new assistant,

21:15.033 --> 21:16.268
so I put in a good word for you.

21:16.269 --> 21:18.554
Really?
Even though I was so mean to you?

21:18.879 --> 21:20.102
Wow thanks.

21:26.299 --> 21:27.747
What's Up Wisconsin?

21:27.997 --> 21:29.783
I licked your phone!

21:29.784 --> 21:31.606
I licked your phone!

21:32.305 --> 21:38.310
