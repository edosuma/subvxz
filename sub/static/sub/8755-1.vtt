00:10.982 --> 00:13.179
Why are there so many dead
bodies laying around here?

00:13.279 --> 00:16.329
When I'm working, it
pushed me pretty good.

00:17.616 --> 00:19.349
He's a slapper, a pincher, a hitter.

00:19.451 --> 00:20.517
Oh, my God.

00:20.619 --> 00:22.286
Out of Butte's beautiful history,

00:22.388 --> 00:23.754
this is the black mark.

00:23.856 --> 00:25.923
What is wrong with this [bleep] place?

00:26.025 --> 00:29.293
I think there is
something very bad here.

00:29.395 --> 00:31.728
There's problems, big problems.

00:31.830 --> 00:36.567
A bunch of perverted freaks.

00:36.669 --> 00:39.570
There's a dark presence.

00:39.672 --> 00:41.705
My name is Amy Allan.

00:41.807 --> 00:43.707
These things, they're freaking out.

00:43.809 --> 00:45.275
They're from hell.

00:45.377 --> 00:46.209
I see dead people.

00:46.312 --> 00:47.477
They were being hunted.

00:47.580 --> 00:49.246
I speak to dead people.

00:49.348 --> 00:52.282
They were setting people
on fire, burning them alive.

00:52.384 --> 00:53.784
And they speak to me.

00:53.886 --> 00:55.085
Her neck got broken.

00:55.187 --> 00:58.055
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:58.157 --> 01:00.057
I hear a gunshot.

01:00.159 --> 01:01.625
I rely on my partner.

01:01.727 --> 01:03.260
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:03.362 --> 01:05.095
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

01:05.197 --> 01:06.296
Something's not right here.

01:06.398 --> 01:09.666
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:09.768 --> 01:10.834
It's not safe here.

01:10.936 --> 01:11.935
It's my job to reveal them.

01:12.037 --> 01:13.503
Are any of them buried on the property?

01:13.606 --> 01:14.638
They're all buried here.

01:14.740 --> 01:16.173
But Steve and I never speak...

01:16.275 --> 01:18.175
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:18.310 --> 01:19.610
Until the very end...

01:19.712 --> 01:20.911
I can't do it no more.

01:21.013 --> 01:22.946
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:23.032 --> 01:24.815
Holy [bleep] look at this.

01:24.917 --> 01:26.283
Or time to get out.

01:26.385 --> 01:27.751
It does not have a happy ending.

01:27.836 --> 01:30.020
Something kills people here.

01:44.003 --> 01:45.135
I'm out here in Butte.

01:45.237 --> 01:48.172
It's an old mining town
in southwest Montana.

01:48.257 --> 01:50.207
I got a call from a woman named Ginny

01:50.309 --> 01:51.642
who sounded real shaken up.

01:51.744 --> 01:54.878
A close friend brought an
old brothel called the Dumas

01:54.980 --> 01:56.663
and restored it into a museum.

01:56.749 --> 01:57.681
Now, she works there,

01:57.783 --> 01:59.483
and she says that paranormal activity

01:59.568 --> 02:01.151
has gotten violent and out of control.

02:01.253 --> 02:02.953
She doesn't think it's safe to be there,

02:03.055 --> 02:05.655
but she says her friend has
become obsessed and won't leave.

02:05.755 --> 02:08.298
I hope Amy and I can help her out.

02:14.346 --> 02:17.047
Before Amy
arrives, I clear the area

02:17.149 --> 02:19.867
of anything that might
influence her findings.

02:19.985 --> 02:23.887
This is a large space with a lot
of artwork and historical items

02:23.989 --> 02:25.422
that need to be removed.

02:25.524 --> 02:27.725
When I'm finished,

02:27.810 --> 02:32.129
the location will be
ready for tonight's walk.

02:46.212 --> 02:47.528
Oh, boy.

02:47.613 --> 02:51.582
I walked in the door, and I
heard, "Get her out of here."

02:51.684 --> 02:55.702
And the one who said, "Get
her out of here," is a male.

02:55.788 --> 02:58.689
I feel like he was an owner.

02:58.824 --> 03:03.761
He looks like he's from pretty far back,

03:03.863 --> 03:07.331
but his presence is very here.

03:07.399 --> 03:13.737
I think he kind of had his
hand in a lot of illegal things,

03:13.839 --> 03:18.475
like I do see prostitutes around him.

03:18.577 --> 03:24.181
I'm hearing "whore".

03:33.592 --> 03:34.725
So, Ginny, I'm glad I'm here.

03:34.827 --> 03:36.059
When we spoke on the phone,

03:36.162 --> 03:37.494
you sounded really concerned
for your friend, Michael.

03:37.596 --> 03:39.863
Yes, Michael is my best friend,

03:39.949 --> 03:43.300
and he bought this brothel
about three years ago.

03:43.402 --> 03:47.137
And he's become pretty
obsessed with the place.

03:47.239 --> 03:48.405
Okay.

03:48.507 --> 03:51.592
Now, he runs it as a
museum, you mentioned?

03:51.677 --> 03:52.543
Yes.

03:52.645 --> 03:54.044
It's a piece of Butte's history.

03:54.146 --> 03:57.965
It was built in 1890 as a brothel.

03:58.050 --> 03:58.932
Okay.

03:59.051 --> 04:01.451
It ran for 92 years illegally,

04:01.554 --> 04:03.654
and the sheriff shut it down in 1982.

04:03.789 --> 04:05.522
Wow, okay. So, it ran for a long time.

04:05.608 --> 04:06.523
It did.

04:06.625 --> 04:07.969
They were gonna knock this down.

04:08.069 --> 04:09.435
So, he saved it from the wrecking ball.

04:09.521 --> 04:10.470
He did.

04:10.572 --> 04:12.729
Okay, now, what is it that you do here?

04:12.829 --> 04:14.162
I do history tours.

04:14.264 --> 04:15.597
Okay.

04:16.019 --> 04:18.286
Now, everybody's having
paranormal experiences here,

04:18.387 --> 04:20.154
- or is it just Michael?
- Everybody.

04:20.290 --> 04:23.675
People are hearing
footsteps, seeing apparitions,

04:23.760 --> 04:25.827
and now things are getting violent.

04:25.912 --> 04:28.079
Michael's had some experiences here

04:28.164 --> 04:30.231
that I'm really concerned about.

04:30.317 --> 04:33.151
He has been pushed by
something he cannot see.

04:33.236 --> 04:36.804
His whole demeanor
changes being in here.

04:36.890 --> 04:38.656
He gets all OCD.

04:38.742 --> 04:43.711
He just, like, gets really
uptight about things in here.

04:43.797 --> 04:46.597
You get him outside those doors,
he's a whole different guy.

04:46.716 --> 04:49.384
It's a concern. It's a concern.

04:49.486 --> 04:50.518
Wow.

04:50.620 --> 04:52.253
What do you think is
going on in this place?

04:52.389 --> 04:54.339
I think there's some
angry spirits in here,

04:54.457 --> 04:55.890
possibly demonic,

04:55.992 --> 04:58.943
and I don't think it likes Michael.

04:59.062 --> 05:01.896
Okay.

05:06.853 --> 05:08.403
There are quite
a few dead people here.

05:08.505 --> 05:16.077
They are very physical
towards the living.

05:16.179 --> 05:19.814
Beating them, molesting them,

05:19.916 --> 05:23.013
um... influencing them.

05:23.558 --> 05:24.791
How would they be influenced?

05:24.876 --> 05:29.001
I think it might change their
behaviors and thought process,

05:29.101 --> 05:32.403
and they might become, you
know, depressed, anxious.

05:32.505 --> 05:37.841
Do weird [bleep] that
they don't normally do.

05:37.977 --> 05:43.414
You know, that would be really bad.

05:49.288 --> 05:51.288
This place is obviously creepy,

05:51.390 --> 05:53.190
but why'd you bring me down here?

05:53.292 --> 05:55.993
Because I've had a few
scary experiences down here.

05:56.095 --> 05:57.094
Okay, like what?

05:57.196 --> 05:59.496
I'll be doing a tour with some folks,

05:59.598 --> 06:01.632
and I see shadows.

06:01.734 --> 06:03.067
They're all over down here.

06:03.169 --> 06:05.135
You can see out of
your peripheral vision,

06:05.237 --> 06:07.121
they just run by you
really, really fast.

06:07.206 --> 06:08.989
Are you sure it's not people on the tour

06:09.089 --> 06:10.999
playing games with the
lights or something?

06:11.099 --> 06:13.700
No, it's happened when I've
been down here by myself.

06:13.785 --> 06:15.298
Okay. So, anything else?

06:16.252 --> 06:17.818
I've had scratching and bruising

06:17.920 --> 06:19.570
when I've left here from my tours.

06:19.655 --> 06:21.455
One night, I literally had a scratch

06:21.540 --> 06:22.906
down the middle of my back.

06:22.992 --> 06:24.391
Not one, not two, but three

06:24.493 --> 06:26.944
down the middle of my
back, and they burned.

06:27.029 --> 06:30.898
I've had bruises on my arms
that look like fingerprints,

06:31.033 --> 06:33.500
and I have no idea where they came from.

06:33.586 --> 06:35.235
I know you called us for Michael,

06:35.337 --> 06:37.421
but I think you need help
just as bad as he does.

06:37.540 --> 06:39.673
I think there is
something very bad here.

06:39.758 --> 06:42.109
I don't know what it is.

06:42.194 --> 06:44.962
Hopefully, Amy can help us with that.

06:45.080 --> 06:46.680
Okay.

06:50.920 --> 06:55.489
The dead here are very capable
of interacting with the living.

06:55.574 --> 06:57.791
It's, like, very direct.

06:57.893 --> 07:01.228
Oh, there's so much.

07:01.330 --> 07:04.097
Oh, my gosh.

07:07.441 --> 07:10.292
The land owner guy, he likes
to keep people out of here.

07:10.377 --> 07:13.411
Here he smothers the
[bleep] out of people.

07:16.049 --> 07:21.586
God, I feel like I'm being
punched in the stomach.

07:21.688 --> 07:24.890
It's horrible, like, it's awful.

07:24.992 --> 07:28.109
So, sure as [bleep],
if people are down here,

07:28.209 --> 07:29.675
there's problems.

07:29.778 --> 07:30.810
Big problems.

07:37.719 --> 07:38.918
It's good to finally meet you.

07:39.020 --> 07:41.684
I've spoken with Ginny. She's
very concerned about you.

07:41.784 --> 07:44.151
She used the word "obsessed"

07:44.286 --> 07:45.485
to describe how you
feel about this place.

07:45.621 --> 07:46.953
- Would you agree with that?
- Yeah.

07:47.089 --> 07:49.239
Sometimes, it's kind
of like a time warp.

07:49.324 --> 07:52.526
I might come here and plan
to be here until midnight,

07:52.661 --> 07:55.162
and then it's 5:00 A.M.

07:55.247 --> 07:56.463
I mean, maybe it's me, I don't know,

07:56.548 --> 07:57.664
but you seem a little bit on edge to me.

07:57.749 --> 07:59.866
If I met you at a bar down the block,

07:59.952 --> 08:02.436
do you think your demeanor
would be different?

08:02.571 --> 08:05.789
Yeah, I feel very
anxious sometimes in here.

08:05.874 --> 08:07.507
I don't know what it is.

08:07.609 --> 08:10.127
What does this building mean to you?

08:10.245 --> 08:11.912
It's such an important landmark place.

08:11.980 --> 08:13.132
It needs to be saved.

08:13.232 --> 08:15.149
I don't look at it as being an owner.

08:15.251 --> 08:18.385
To me, it's more of kind of stewardship.

08:18.471 --> 08:20.638
It doesn't belong to me,

08:20.756 --> 08:24.742
as much as it belongs
to Montana and Butte.

08:24.860 --> 08:26.977
So, do you feel that you have
an obligation to this building?

08:27.096 --> 08:27.845
Mm-hmm.

08:27.930 --> 08:29.430
- You do?
- Yeah.

08:29.532 --> 08:30.698
That's interesting.

08:30.833 --> 08:33.801
Ginny mentioned that it's
gotten pretty violent.

08:33.903 --> 08:34.868
Mm-hmm. Yes.

08:34.971 --> 08:37.304
Here and to you in particular.

08:37.405 --> 08:38.472
What happened?

08:38.573 --> 08:42.208
She and I were in
here one night working.

08:42.311 --> 08:47.247
I was pushed kind of like
a... more in the face,

08:47.333 --> 08:49.950
it felt like, but it
pushed me pretty good.

08:50.036 --> 08:52.152
She was right behind
me, and she just said,

08:52.288 --> 08:54.321
"What the [bleep]
was that?" And then...

08:54.407 --> 08:56.774
I think nine out of ten
people would have packed up

08:56.892 --> 08:58.692
and [bleep] got out of
here, put it up for sale,

08:58.778 --> 08:59.526
to be honest with you.

08:59.612 --> 09:02.296
Yeah, yeah.

09:02.398 --> 09:03.464
Why don't you just give this place up?

09:03.599 --> 09:09.169
I'm very attached to it. Unexplainably.

09:11.841 --> 09:14.742
The land owner is mean.

09:14.844 --> 09:18.071
He's a slapper, a pincher, a hitter.

09:18.171 --> 09:21.023
If somebody he doesn't like is around,

09:21.123 --> 09:22.022
he'll do it to them.

09:25.494 --> 09:27.761
Do you know if
people might see this guy?

09:27.863 --> 09:32.433
I think that they see a dark mist.

09:39.041 --> 09:40.407
Oh, boy.

09:40.543 --> 09:42.943
This is not good.

09:43.045 --> 09:49.083
This place is not
healthy for living people.

10:08.427 --> 10:10.855
Now, Ginny called us in 'cause
she was worried about Michael.

10:10.955 --> 10:11.939
He's your partner.

10:12.039 --> 10:13.088
How long you two guys been together?

10:13.207 --> 10:15.687
We've been together for eight years.

10:15.787 --> 10:17.881
Okay, and you guys owned
this place for three.

10:17.907 --> 10:18.429
Yes.

10:18.490 --> 10:19.522
So you know him pretty well.

10:19.607 --> 10:21.257
How concerned are you for Mike?

10:21.342 --> 10:25.878
I do have a pretty
strong concern for him.

10:25.980 --> 10:29.549
His mood swings are really
bad since we bought it.

10:29.684 --> 10:35.188
I've noticed he's more
obsessive-compulsive, agitated.

10:35.323 --> 10:40.276
A lot of times, that
anger gets taken out on me.

10:40.395 --> 10:41.594
Wow.

10:41.679 --> 10:43.529
What do they say, you take
out stuff on the ones you love?

10:43.631 --> 10:44.764
Yeah.

10:44.866 --> 10:47.100
I've talked to Ginny.
I've talked to Michael.

10:47.202 --> 10:48.968
People are having experiences here.

10:49.070 --> 10:50.269
Now, what about yourself?

10:50.371 --> 10:53.106
I was in one of the
rooms, and all of a sudden,

10:53.208 --> 10:56.709
I felt this really warm
hand on my shoulder.

10:56.811 --> 11:01.264
And then moments after I felt
the hand, along with the hand,

11:01.382 --> 11:04.350
there was this really warm
breath going across my neck.

11:04.436 --> 11:06.602
Would you say it was a man or
a woman's hand that touched you?

11:06.688 --> 11:09.222
I would definitely say it was a woman's.

11:09.307 --> 11:15.578
It was a lot more intimate,
almost sensual in a way.

11:15.697 --> 11:17.263
You mean like a woman coming onto you?

11:17.365 --> 11:18.614
Yeah.

11:21.904 --> 11:24.671
There's a female who's very sexual.

11:24.757 --> 11:26.974
What does she do?

11:27.059 --> 11:28.709
She's hands-on.

11:28.794 --> 11:31.912
I think she likes younger men.

11:32.014 --> 11:34.331
If she finds somebody attractive,

11:34.416 --> 11:37.017
she'll do stuff.

11:37.119 --> 11:38.618
She's physical that way.

11:41.593 --> 11:42.425
Travis, let me ask you a question

11:42.528 --> 11:43.827
about the tours you do here.

11:43.929 --> 11:46.586
Have you had any
complaints about anything?

11:46.686 --> 11:48.519
From the customers
that have come through?

11:48.622 --> 11:51.149
I've heard a wide variety
of different things.

11:51.249 --> 11:55.868
People getting pinched,
their hair tugged repeatedly.

11:55.953 --> 11:59.622
I've even seen people
go running out the door.

11:59.724 --> 12:01.757
They get nauseated.

12:01.843 --> 12:04.483
I've even seen a couple of
them, you know, throw up.

12:04.583 --> 12:05.966
Now, obviously, you believe that

12:06.085 --> 12:07.584
there's something supernatural here.

12:07.669 --> 12:09.269
Oh, without a doubt.

12:09.388 --> 12:13.523
I think there's numerous spirits here.

12:15.527 --> 12:19.830
Oh, oh. Oh, boy.

12:19.915 --> 12:25.302
I don't like... I
don't like upstairs.

12:25.437 --> 12:28.605
Lots of anxiety up here.

12:28.690 --> 12:32.075
Lots of anxiety, lots of stress.

12:32.161 --> 12:36.246
Like, it's... it's
kind of making me sick.

12:36.348 --> 12:38.532
It's like making my stomach upset.

12:38.617 --> 12:39.750
I feel nauseous.

12:42.171 --> 12:44.179
Ooh. My goodness. Oh, my.

12:44.214 --> 12:46.187
Really, really, really bad.

12:52.712 --> 12:54.570
So, Ron, I understand
that you've done some work

12:54.670 --> 12:56.570
in the building restoring it.

12:56.672 --> 12:57.988
- Yes.
- Okay.

12:58.107 --> 12:59.189
Quite a bit.

12:59.274 --> 13:01.324
Have you had any experiences
that you can't explain?

13:01.443 --> 13:03.643
When I was working here,

13:03.745 --> 13:06.696
I got the sense that
I was gonna get killed.

13:06.815 --> 13:12.519
An evil presence, like,
telling me get out of here.

13:12.621 --> 13:14.855
Really?

13:14.957 --> 13:16.590
Has anything else happened to you?

13:16.692 --> 13:19.025
My tools would end up missing,

13:19.128 --> 13:21.411
and then I started
getting really scared.

13:21.497 --> 13:24.698
The hair on the back of my neck come up.

13:24.800 --> 13:26.433
And nobody's here messing with you?

13:26.535 --> 13:27.467
No.

13:27.569 --> 13:28.602
And you still come down here.

13:28.687 --> 13:30.487
I won't come down no more by myself.

13:30.606 --> 13:31.897
- You don't?
- Nope.

13:31.997 --> 13:32.713
Now, Ron, you don't strike me

13:32.813 --> 13:34.196
as the type of guy that scares too easy.

13:34.281 --> 13:35.197
Not too easy.

13:35.299 --> 13:36.281
I was a boxer

13:36.367 --> 13:39.718
and hard brick layer, a concrete man.

13:39.837 --> 13:41.570
I'm not scared of much.

13:41.672 --> 13:44.072
But this place seems to spook you out.

13:44.174 --> 13:47.309
Yes, it's... it's
dangerous down here.

13:47.394 --> 13:48.543
I honestly believe that.

13:48.646 --> 13:50.612
Okay.

13:52.149 --> 13:54.016
And then there's another lady.

13:54.118 --> 13:59.406
She likes to torture people,
but she is one to move things.

13:59.506 --> 14:02.874
Open and close doors, move
objects, [bleep] like that.

14:02.976 --> 14:05.527
Can you describe her?

14:06.444 --> 14:10.029
Her skin is like tree bark,

14:10.114 --> 14:14.783
and her arms are twisted
like the roots of a tree.

14:14.869 --> 14:17.903
But it's so weird how
each of these dead people

14:17.989 --> 14:20.289
has very specific, physical things

14:20.424 --> 14:22.208
that they do with the living.

14:22.293 --> 14:25.528
It's almost like they've had
a dialogue, and they're, like,

14:25.630 --> 14:27.429
"Well, I do this, so don't you dare."

14:27.515 --> 14:29.932
What would all this
mean for the living here?

14:30.017 --> 14:37.089
They would be, you know,
toys for the dead people.

14:53.732 --> 14:55.315
Look, it doesn't take a
homicide detective to figure out

14:55.434 --> 14:56.483
what my first move is here,

14:56.602 --> 14:58.602
especially since Michael
and Travis's building

14:58.704 --> 15:00.070
used to be a brothel.

15:00.172 --> 15:02.773
I'm heading back to the Dumas
to meet with a local historian

15:02.875 --> 15:05.075
who said life there was
everything you would expect

15:05.160 --> 15:06.109
and worse.

15:15.220 --> 15:17.220
Let's start from the beginning.

15:17.305 --> 15:19.088
Who built this building and when?

15:19.191 --> 15:22.926
The building was actually built
by Arthur and Joseph Nadeau.

15:23.028 --> 15:25.995
This is a photograph of Joseph.

15:27.184 --> 15:30.653
The brothers built
this building in 1890,

15:30.753 --> 15:33.053
and they also built
other red-light properties

15:33.139 --> 15:34.255
here in the district.

15:34.340 --> 15:36.223
So, these guys were
pretty smart businessmen.

15:36.292 --> 15:38.175
They were very well-educated brothers,

15:38.294 --> 15:40.594
yes, and they were very wealthy.

15:40.680 --> 15:41.812
Okay.

15:41.931 --> 15:44.064
But the Nadeau brothers
apparently kind of separated.

15:44.133 --> 15:45.766
We really don't know why.

15:45.851 --> 15:48.202
And Joseph stayed around
and ran the business.

15:48.304 --> 15:49.670
Okay.

15:50.298 --> 15:52.548
So, now, what about Joseph?
Whatever happened to him?

15:52.634 --> 15:55.635
Well, Joseph died in 1925 here in Butte.

15:55.720 --> 15:57.503
Okay, now, how old was Joe when he died?

15:57.639 --> 15:58.704
He was 77.

16:02.310 --> 16:05.745
This guy, he's gonna
cause some [bleep] problems.

16:05.847 --> 16:08.114
I've seen a lot of dead
people in this place,

16:08.216 --> 16:10.683
but my biggest concern is the land owner

16:10.785 --> 16:12.185
who attacks the living,

16:12.287 --> 16:15.037
and I'm trying to get a
look into who he was in life.

16:15.156 --> 16:20.159
He's super negative
and extremely greedy.

16:20.261 --> 16:24.197
Like, disgustingly greedy.

16:24.299 --> 16:27.817
Do you know what his
connection here might be?

16:27.936 --> 16:30.553
I think he might have owned the land

16:30.672 --> 16:33.406
and potentially built this building.

16:33.474 --> 16:35.358
Can you describe him more?

16:35.476 --> 16:37.491
He's very well educated and wealthy.

16:37.591 --> 16:39.224
White hair, pal skin,

16:39.326 --> 16:44.463
and I heard 1900 and 1901 for him.

16:44.565 --> 16:47.599
There was a lot of movement
in here, a lot of traffic,

16:47.701 --> 16:50.769
which benefited him with what he did.

16:50.871 --> 16:52.471
He is really nasty.

16:55.309 --> 16:57.843
The Nadeau
brothers opened this place

16:57.945 --> 17:00.178
as a very high-end brothel.

17:00.314 --> 17:01.229
Okay.

17:01.348 --> 17:03.965
Very exclusive clients would come here

17:04.050 --> 17:08.146
and spend as much as $1,000
a night on entertainment.

17:08.247 --> 17:10.212
So, the girls who worked
here were pretty high-end?

17:10.311 --> 17:11.795
They were very, very high-end girls.

17:11.896 --> 17:14.240
They were supposedly
very, very beautiful.

17:14.339 --> 17:16.406
You know, Ellen, I was down
in that basement yesterday,

17:16.509 --> 17:17.775
and I got to be honest with you.

17:17.877 --> 17:19.210
It didn't look too high end to me.

17:19.311 --> 17:21.499
Yeah, it wasn't too high end.

17:21.598 --> 17:23.098
You know, here's what happened.

17:23.200 --> 17:26.001
The copper kings left Butte in 1900,

17:26.103 --> 17:28.938
and so the business had to adjust.

17:29.023 --> 17:32.308
The upper floor catered
to the upper class.

17:32.410 --> 17:36.011
The ground floor catered
to more of a business class,

17:36.113 --> 17:40.082
and the basement catered to
the miners and the laborers.

17:40.184 --> 17:42.151
So, I got to imagine, just
looking at that basement,

17:42.236 --> 17:43.819
the conditions had to be
really bad for these girls.

17:43.955 --> 17:46.155
It probably wasn't a
pleasant place to work,

17:46.240 --> 17:49.708
and the women charged
50 cents a customer

17:49.827 --> 17:54.179
and maybe would service
50 men during a work shift.

17:54.265 --> 17:56.465
The mines operated 24 hours a day,

17:56.550 --> 17:58.033
and so did the women.

17:58.135 --> 18:00.002
These miners had to be rough customers.

18:00.137 --> 18:01.971
It was a really dangerous undertaking.

18:02.073 --> 18:06.008
There was violence. There was addiction.

18:06.093 --> 18:08.711
Alcohol, laudanum, opium.

18:08.796 --> 18:12.214
There was the danger of pregnancy.

18:12.316 --> 18:15.167
- It was a dangerous business.
- Right.

18:15.286 --> 18:17.252
- There's no question about that.
- Wow.

18:20.241 --> 18:21.991
Nothing is legitimate.

18:22.076 --> 18:23.826
They all have perversions.

18:23.911 --> 18:26.462
They're dirty, and they're angry,

18:26.530 --> 18:31.333
so a bunch of perverted freaks.

18:31.435 --> 18:36.789
I feel like there was a
lot of drugs and alcohol.

18:36.874 --> 18:44.913
Like opium, like hash,
like marijuana, cocaine.

18:44.999 --> 18:48.751
I see a lot of, like,
people laying down here.

18:48.853 --> 18:50.719
Like, just laying around.

18:50.821 --> 18:51.654
How many?

18:51.756 --> 18:53.055
A lot.

18:55.960 --> 18:58.560
I did hear mining.

18:58.663 --> 19:00.729
Are you [bleep] kidding me?

19:00.831 --> 19:05.467
I'm trying not to be negative,
but it's kind of impossible here

19:05.603 --> 19:08.904
because this is not a good place.

19:09.006 --> 19:11.490
This is a cycle. This is a cycle.

19:11.609 --> 19:12.474
What?

19:12.610 --> 19:19.365
Anybody who rents
maybe or buys this place

19:19.483 --> 19:22.885
is not on the up-and-up.

19:22.987 --> 19:24.687
I'm, like, what is wrong
with this [bleep] place?

19:31.209 --> 19:32.508
If you need us to investigate

19:32.610 --> 19:34.226
unexplained activity in your home,

19:34.345 --> 19:37.112
go to the "Dead Files"
page at travelchannel.com.

19:37.198 --> 19:39.014
Click on "Help me, Dead
Files!" to submit your story,

19:39.116 --> 19:40.403
and we'll help if we can.

19:46.986 --> 19:48.452
So far, I've got clients

19:48.588 --> 19:50.288
who've been physically
assaulted on a property

19:50.423 --> 19:52.623
that used to be ground
zero for sex and violence.

19:52.725 --> 19:56.694
But I need to see if
there's anything else.

19:56.796 --> 19:58.329
Digging through the archives,

19:58.431 --> 20:01.182
I find a woman named Gertrude Pitkanen.

20:01.301 --> 20:04.368
Turns out, she was charged with
three counts of manslaughter

20:04.470 --> 20:06.037
after performing illegal abortions

20:06.139 --> 20:08.372
in Butte's red-light district.

20:08.474 --> 20:11.759
So, I made some calls, and it turns out,

20:11.878 --> 20:14.629
it's very likely that
prostitutes from the Dumas

20:14.714 --> 20:16.898
ended up going to this
illegal abortion doctor.

20:16.983 --> 20:19.000
I'm heading over to meet
with a local professor

20:19.118 --> 20:21.035
who says that this case
takes an even darker

20:21.120 --> 20:22.687
and more horrifying twist.

20:31.247 --> 20:34.232
So, what can you
tell me about this woman?

20:34.334 --> 20:38.402
Her name was Gertrude Pitkanen.
Locals called her Gertie.

20:38.538 --> 20:41.839
She ran a back-alley abortion clinic.

20:41.941 --> 20:44.292
Now, would she have ever
done abortions at the Dumas?

20:44.377 --> 20:45.543
Sure, absolutely.

20:45.628 --> 20:48.229
Ladies that worked at the Dumas Brothel,

20:48.348 --> 20:51.098
they got pregnant, they
didn't have a lot of options.

20:51.184 --> 20:52.633
If you were pregnant,

20:52.752 --> 20:54.285
and you were showing,
you were out of business.

20:54.370 --> 20:59.073
But one of their best
options was Gertie.

20:59.192 --> 21:01.592
- I read she got charged three times.
- Yes.

21:01.678 --> 21:03.060
- What was the story behind that?
- Three charges.

21:03.146 --> 21:08.716
Manslaughter, all three of
them, between 1929 and 1939.

21:08.835 --> 21:11.969
Because of botched abortions.

21:12.055 --> 21:15.273
The gals that she
performed the abortion on

21:15.358 --> 21:17.692
died directly because of her services.

21:17.810 --> 21:20.912
Here's their death certificates.

21:21.014 --> 21:23.614
All right, so what was the
outcomes of these trials?

21:23.700 --> 21:26.665
All three of those charges
were thrown out of court

21:26.765 --> 21:27.964
due to a lack of evidence.

21:29.301 --> 21:30.367
On the phone, you had mentioned

21:30.469 --> 21:33.136
that this story had a dark turn to it.

21:33.238 --> 21:34.771
I mean, how much darker could it get?

21:34.873 --> 21:35.682
Pretty dark.

21:35.782 --> 21:37.882
Some of these young mothers,
not wanting an abortion,

21:37.968 --> 21:40.602
wanting to go full-term, were told

21:40.721 --> 21:43.655
right after they had given
birth that the babies had died

21:43.740 --> 21:45.090
when they actually hadn't.

21:45.192 --> 21:47.959
They would be taken out the back door.

21:48.045 --> 21:51.162
In some cases, with the
placenta still attached.

21:51.264 --> 21:54.199
And Gertie would turn
around and sell those babies

21:54.284 --> 21:55.467
on the black market.

21:55.552 --> 21:59.738
14 we know of, possibly up to 28.

21:59.840 --> 22:02.590
Going rate was about 500 bucks.

22:02.676 --> 22:04.926
All right, so she's a piece
of [bleep] for doing this.

22:05.011 --> 22:05.944
Yes, yes.

22:06.029 --> 22:07.779
Out of Butte's beautiful history,

22:07.864 --> 22:09.080
this is the black mark.

22:12.319 --> 22:15.653
Why are there so many [bleep]
dead bodies laying around here?

22:18.608 --> 22:19.824
How many?

22:19.910 --> 22:21.526
A lot.

22:21.628 --> 22:25.797
Majority men, but there are women,

22:25.899 --> 22:28.900
and there are children, okay.

22:30.687 --> 22:32.520
I'm seeing, like, a lot of kids.

22:32.639 --> 22:37.563
Too many kids for one family.

22:37.663 --> 22:41.649
It's almost like a daycare.

22:41.767 --> 22:43.300
And something about these children,

22:43.386 --> 22:45.102
like, they didn't have parents.

22:45.204 --> 22:50.207
So, I almost wonder if they
were, like, selling these kids?

22:55.982 --> 23:01.085
Like, drug dealers and
children sellers and pimps.

23:01.187 --> 23:02.219
Oh, my God.

23:03.222 --> 23:06.707
You got a brothel catering to
some pretty tough customers,

23:06.792 --> 23:07.791
so I got to think, there had to be

23:07.877 --> 23:09.043
a couple of homicides in there.

23:09.128 --> 23:11.328
I called the Butte sheriff
who did some digging,

23:11.430 --> 23:13.314
and he came up with
two suspicious deaths

23:13.399 --> 23:14.448
that may help my case.

23:22.208 --> 23:24.329
Sheriff, why did you want to meet here?

23:24.955 --> 23:27.022
Well, this is the old city jail

23:27.107 --> 23:28.907
where anybody who was
arrested in the area,

23:29.026 --> 23:30.909
the red-light district,
would likely have come

23:30.994 --> 23:32.346
had they been arrested.

23:32.446 --> 23:33.945
Okay, now, you mentioned on the phone,

23:34.081 --> 23:36.198
there were two suspicious
deaths connected to the Dumas.

23:36.283 --> 23:37.949
Let's start with the first one.

23:38.085 --> 23:39.184
Elinor Knott.

23:39.320 --> 23:41.353
She was the madame at the Dumas Brothel

23:41.488 --> 23:44.389
from 1950 to 1955 when she passed away.

23:44.525 --> 23:45.807
Okay.

23:45.893 --> 23:49.361
Her body was found on the second
floor of the Dumas Brothel.

23:49.496 --> 23:53.031
I have Elinor's death
certificate right here.

23:53.117 --> 23:56.134
It lists coronary occlusion
as the cause of her death.

23:56.236 --> 23:58.236
Her heart disease had
progressed to where it was fatal.

23:58.322 --> 24:00.339
She was young, though, 42.

24:00.474 --> 24:03.392
She is relatively young to
have that kind of heart disease.

24:03.477 --> 24:05.610
So, why was that
suspicious, do you think?

24:05.746 --> 24:07.713
There was a woman named Bonita Farren

24:07.798 --> 24:10.682
who took over as the
madame of the Dumas Brothel

24:10.768 --> 24:13.452
after Elinor Knott passed away.

24:13.537 --> 24:15.237
And there was a rumor that

24:15.356 --> 24:18.290
Bonita may have had something
to do with Elinor Knott's death

24:18.425 --> 24:19.958
so she could take over the brothel.

24:20.044 --> 24:22.060
Now, you mentioned there was
a second suspicious death.

24:22.146 --> 24:22.928
What was that?

24:23.063 --> 24:24.229
Yeah, the second death

24:24.365 --> 24:27.032
is Bonita Farren's husband, John Farren.

24:27.167 --> 24:29.484
I have John Farren's death
certificate right here.

24:29.603 --> 24:30.819
Cerebral hemorrhage.

24:30.938 --> 24:33.271
Yeah, it appears that he
had fallen down the stairs,

24:33.357 --> 24:35.640
and he was discovered at
the bottom of a staircase

24:35.743 --> 24:37.159
near the rear of the brothel.

24:37.244 --> 24:39.211
Yeah, I know that staircase pretty well.

24:39.313 --> 24:40.912
That's quite a flight of stairs.

24:40.998 --> 24:43.698
The doctor who signed the
death certificate believed

24:43.784 --> 24:46.084
that alcohol was a contributing
factor to his death.

24:46.220 --> 24:48.787
And it kind of connected
in a way, too, because...

24:48.889 --> 24:50.806
Yeah, the link being Bonita Farren, yes.

24:50.891 --> 24:52.474
Okay.

24:57.498 --> 25:00.566
During my walk, I
encountered a very sexual woman.

25:00.668 --> 25:02.835
I'm meeting with a
sketch artist to describe

25:02.937 --> 25:05.337
what I saw her doing to a living male.

25:05.439 --> 25:08.307
A male was laying in the bed,

25:08.409 --> 25:14.780
and a female was
caressing the male's chest.

25:14.882 --> 25:20.486
She had big brown eyes and
delicate facial features.

25:20.588 --> 25:23.989
And she was kind of
standing beside the bed

25:24.091 --> 25:27.459
looking down and touching him.

25:27.562 --> 25:28.527
Is that what you saw?

25:28.629 --> 25:31.497
Yes, that's what I saw.

25:49.468 --> 25:52.470
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

25:52.570 --> 25:54.737
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

25:54.839 --> 25:57.973
and our clients for the first time.

25:58.075 --> 26:00.275
Amy, I'd like you to
meet Michael and Travis.

26:00.361 --> 26:03.912
Now, these guys are partners
in life and in business.

26:04.014 --> 26:07.199
They bought this historic
building about three years ago,

26:07.284 --> 26:09.952
but they feel like something
doesn't want them here.

26:10.087 --> 26:12.438
But they're not the
ones that called us in.

26:12.556 --> 26:14.169
This is Ginny. That's
Michael's best friend.

26:14.833 --> 26:16.516
She also works here as a tour guide.

26:16.651 --> 26:19.052
She believes that whatever's
here is changing Michael,

26:19.137 --> 26:21.888
and she's worried that
he might be in danger.

26:21.973 --> 26:23.923
So, now that Amy knows
a little bit about

26:24.026 --> 26:25.525
what's going on with you guys,

26:25.627 --> 26:27.827
I'm gonna ask her to
describe her walk for us.

26:27.929 --> 26:31.965
When I first walked in the door,

26:32.067 --> 26:34.934
I heard a male say, "Get out of here."

26:35.037 --> 26:38.805
And I heard a woman call out, "whore".

26:38.907 --> 26:42.942
I immediately got that
there was a lot of alcohol,

26:43.028 --> 26:47.447
and then somebody was talking
about specific drug usage here.

26:47.582 --> 26:50.333
Opium, hash, marijuana, and cocaine.

26:50.452 --> 26:53.253
Well, let me tell you a
little bit about the building.

26:53.355 --> 26:54.954
We're smack in the
middle of what used to be

26:55.040 --> 26:56.840
Butte's red-light district.

26:56.958 --> 27:01.978
This building operated as
a brothel from 1890 to 1982.

27:03.381 --> 27:05.298
And there were competing
brothels all around this area.

27:05.400 --> 27:08.735
I managed to track
down a couple of photos

27:08.837 --> 27:11.071
from what used to be
behind this building here.

27:13.442 --> 27:15.809
Now, as you can imagine, the
conditions for these women

27:15.911 --> 27:17.827
had to be really bad, and
a lot of them turned to

27:17.946 --> 27:20.363
alcohol and drugs, including opium.

27:20.482 --> 27:23.756
Now, back in '82, the Dumas Brothel

27:23.856 --> 27:26.490
was shut down and
neglected for a long time.

27:26.575 --> 27:28.292
Michael stepped in, and he saved it.

27:28.394 --> 27:30.727
Now, he's been renovating it

27:30.863 --> 27:33.764
and turning it into
an historical museum.

27:33.866 --> 27:37.718
Sometimes I think it's crazy.

27:37.803 --> 27:43.247
We've put ourselves into
debt to try and restore it.

27:43.347 --> 27:47.704
I don't know why. I
don't know what drew me.

27:47.804 --> 27:50.805
I fell in love with
it when I entered it.

27:50.907 --> 27:54.459
I felt that if someone
didn't step up to the plate

27:54.578 --> 27:57.395
to take it over, it
would cease to exist.

27:57.514 --> 28:00.148
Interesting.

28:04.338 --> 28:08.140
The basement was extremely active.

28:08.259 --> 28:10.893
Going down there, it's like shocking.

28:11.028 --> 28:14.563
The majority of the people
I saw down there were men.

28:14.648 --> 28:20.435
They seemed to have
interesting sexual proclivities.

28:20.521 --> 28:22.838
They were all, like,
doing dirty business

28:22.940 --> 28:24.022
and stuff like that.

28:24.108 --> 28:26.341
I heard somebody talking about mining.

28:27.678 --> 28:31.547
And then I was getting
punched. Punched in the stomach.

28:31.632 --> 28:34.032
It's interesting you
talk about the basement.

28:34.151 --> 28:36.001
Nobody likes the basement at all.

28:36.086 --> 28:39.254
And Ginny, tell her how you
feel like when you're down there,

28:39.356 --> 28:40.917
it's like a terrible feeling for you.

28:41.017 --> 28:42.433
All the time, I
feel like I'm being watched.

28:42.519 --> 28:45.119
In fact, I was chased up the stairs,

28:45.205 --> 28:47.188
and I don't know what
I was being chased by.

28:49.125 --> 28:51.159
Well, let me explain
why you might have seen

28:51.294 --> 28:52.860
some of those things in the basement.

28:52.962 --> 28:56.430
Each level of the Dumas catered
to a different clientele.

28:56.533 --> 28:58.366
Top floor was for the high echelon.

28:58.468 --> 29:02.170
The main floor was, you
know, middle-class-type guys.

29:02.305 --> 29:04.572
But the basement was for the miners.

29:04.657 --> 29:07.108
Now, it was a nasty place.

29:07.193 --> 29:08.676
From what I was told, from an expert,

29:08.778 --> 29:10.962
they would service up
to maybe 50 guys a day.

29:13.533 --> 29:19.804
The other thing that I saw down
there was a lot of children.

29:20.555 --> 29:23.223
They weren't particularly cared for,

29:23.325 --> 29:25.458
so I'm thinking they
didn't have parents.

29:25.560 --> 29:28.711
Then I ran into this guy.

29:28.830 --> 29:31.748
He was definitely like
a pimp and a drug runner,

29:31.833 --> 29:36.736
and I was feeling like maybe
he also sold the children.

29:36.838 --> 29:38.605
That's interesting.

29:38.707 --> 29:41.207
From the 1920s through the 1950s,

29:41.293 --> 29:46.112
a woman named Gertie Pitkanen
and her husband, Gustavus,

29:46.198 --> 29:47.881
ran what they called a maternity clinic

29:47.966 --> 29:49.415
a couple blocks from here.

29:49.484 --> 29:51.017
What she really ran
was an abortion clinic.

29:51.119 --> 29:53.987
Now, if a prostitute got
pregnant here at the Dumas,

29:54.072 --> 29:55.205
you know, they had two choices.

29:55.323 --> 29:56.523
Either get an abortion,
or you're out of work.

29:56.658 --> 29:57.574
Okay.

29:57.692 --> 29:59.542
Now, Gertie Pitkanen was performing

29:59.661 --> 30:02.478
these back-alley abortions,
and they were very dangerous.

30:02.564 --> 30:04.280
Over a 10-year period,

30:04.399 --> 30:05.999
she wound up getting
charged three different times

30:06.084 --> 30:07.400
for manslaughter.

30:07.485 --> 30:09.385
I actually was able to get a
hold of the death certificates

30:09.504 --> 30:11.738
here of three young ladies who died

30:11.873 --> 30:14.951
as a result of botched abortions.

30:15.051 --> 30:16.133
Oh, my goodness.

30:16.268 --> 30:18.335
But she was never convicted.

30:19.139 --> 30:21.856
Now, you mentioned
something about selling kids.

30:21.975 --> 30:23.007
Yes.

30:23.092 --> 30:27.945
Gertie, on at least 14
documented occasions,

30:28.031 --> 30:31.783
was telling mothers that
their babies were stillborn

30:31.868 --> 30:34.152
and then taking those
babies that were alive

30:34.237 --> 30:36.587
and selling them for
$500 on the black market.

30:36.673 --> 30:38.523
Wow.

30:38.625 --> 30:40.258
They're known as Gertie's babies.

30:46.833 --> 30:49.600
I met two women in here.

30:49.702 --> 30:54.071
The first one I encountered
in one of the bedrooms,

30:54.174 --> 31:00.578
and she creeped me out because
of the way that she looked.

31:00.663 --> 31:04.248
Her skin looks like tree bark.

31:04.350 --> 31:08.219
Her arms were really
long but, like, twisted,

31:08.321 --> 31:11.272
and her fingers looked like tree roots.

31:11.391 --> 31:13.257
So, it was very bizarre.

31:13.359 --> 31:17.461
She is able to move objects
and open and close doors.

31:17.547 --> 31:21.199
She's the one who can do
little things like that.

31:21.301 --> 31:23.136
Talking about moving objects.

31:23.236 --> 31:24.369
They had a guy named Ron

31:24.471 --> 31:25.637
that's a brick mason working down there.

31:25.739 --> 31:27.405
Ginny, tell 'em how
his stuff goes missing.

31:27.541 --> 31:29.546
Stuff moves on its own down there.

31:29.646 --> 31:32.113
He'll lay it down, and he'll
go he know he put it there.

31:32.198 --> 31:35.365
And he'll go back to
get it, and it's gone.

31:35.465 --> 31:39.968
It usually takes about twice
as long to do any work in here

31:40.070 --> 31:41.486
because you spend half the time

31:41.605 --> 31:43.988
just trying to find the
materials or the tools

31:44.107 --> 31:46.491
because as soon as you turn
your back, they're gone.

31:46.576 --> 31:49.010
That's, like up her alley, so.

31:49.112 --> 31:50.879
Wow.

31:52.182 --> 31:55.567
So, I met another lady.

31:55.652 --> 31:57.827
I guess you could call
her, like, a nymphomaniac.

31:57.927 --> 31:59.380
Considering where we
are, I'm not shocked.

31:59.480 --> 32:04.550
She's interested in
younger, muscular men,

32:04.635 --> 32:09.688
and she likes to touch people
inappropriately and sexually.

32:09.790 --> 32:12.608
I did have a sketch done of her.

32:26.374 --> 32:28.374
She was trying to seduce me.

32:30.261 --> 32:32.444
It was shortly after
we bought the building,

32:32.580 --> 32:35.547
and I was cleaning up all the cobwebs.

32:35.633 --> 32:40.052
All of a sudden, I felt this
really warm hand on my shoulder.

32:40.137 --> 32:43.134
Along with it, there was
really warm, gentle breath

32:43.169 --> 32:45.434
across my neck.

32:45.520 --> 32:47.694
So, do you think
she was a prostitute here?

32:47.794 --> 32:51.921
Yeah, and I think she
very much enjoyed her job.

32:52.021 --> 32:53.887
I mean, is it a threat to them?

32:56.075 --> 32:58.191
Well, I think that being molested

32:58.327 --> 33:01.929
in the middle of the night
would maybe be a problem.

33:06.036 --> 33:07.318
So, what else is going on?

33:07.404 --> 33:09.237
I met this guy.

33:09.372 --> 33:13.891
He is a very dominant personality here,

33:13.977 --> 33:16.978
and he concerns me a great deal.

33:17.113 --> 33:20.832
He was not happy that I was here.

33:20.951 --> 33:23.351
He's a very, very negative person.

33:23.453 --> 33:27.855
People might see him as an elderly man,

33:27.958 --> 33:32.460
or they see, like, a fog,
gray or a black fog.

33:32.562 --> 33:36.431
I kept referring to him
as the landowner guy.

33:36.566 --> 33:38.700
He goes everywhere,

33:38.802 --> 33:40.802
but he does like to
hang out in the basement.

33:40.870 --> 33:44.038
He is very physical.

33:44.140 --> 33:47.241
If he doesn't like you,

33:47.327 --> 33:50.645
he'll do things like
pushing, shoving, pinching.

33:50.747 --> 33:54.799
If he really doesn't like somebody,

33:54.884 --> 33:56.584
he'll become even more violent.

33:56.686 --> 33:59.053
He'll actually, like,
try to smother people.

33:59.189 --> 34:02.223
And when he does that, it's
because he wants to kill them.

34:05.795 --> 34:09.112
Now, you got shoved in the
face. Tell Amy what happened.

34:09.199 --> 34:11.299
Ginny and
myself came in one night

34:11.400 --> 34:13.635
and walked down the hall there,

34:13.737 --> 34:19.139
and it just full force, fwoof,
and it knocked me backward.

34:19.242 --> 34:22.710
Ginny was right behind
me, and I think she said,

34:22.812 --> 34:24.062
"What the [bleep] was that?"

34:26.683 --> 34:28.815
Now, she goes home with
bruises all the time.

34:28.918 --> 34:31.351
I do go home with bruises
once in a while, yes, I do.

34:31.438 --> 34:34.121
And it's other people... some
of the people on the tours.

34:34.206 --> 34:36.524
Interesting.

34:36.609 --> 34:39.293
Now, you mentioned something
about a mist, a shadow?

34:39.379 --> 34:41.529
Now, you guys reported.

34:41.665 --> 34:44.248
We see mists in here, you bet.

34:44.367 --> 34:50.455
Do you feel threatened
sometimes by these incidents?

34:50.572 --> 34:50.981
Yes.

34:51.627 --> 34:53.839
There's been a few times I've left.

34:54.839 --> 34:58.524
Do you have any idea who this
guy might have been in life?

34:58.610 --> 35:02.278
Well, when he was alive,
he was very, very greedy.

35:02.397 --> 35:04.096
I got that he was the boss.

35:04.198 --> 35:05.031
Hmm.

35:05.133 --> 35:06.766
I think that he was the first owner.

35:06.851 --> 35:09.151
I think he possibly had something to do

35:09.270 --> 35:10.534
with the building of this place.

35:11.013 --> 35:15.298
There was a lot of business,
which he benefited greatly from.

35:15.400 --> 35:20.103
And I got the years 1900 and
1901 specifically for him.

35:20.189 --> 35:22.973
All right, so let me tell
you about the original owner

35:23.058 --> 35:24.174
and see if we have a match.

35:24.276 --> 35:26.042
His name was Joseph Nadeau,

35:26.145 --> 35:28.879
and he built this building
as a brothel in 1890.

35:28.981 --> 35:29.946
Oh!

35:30.032 --> 35:31.615
And he opened up until he died in 1925.

35:31.750 --> 35:33.750
The guy was a shrewd businessman.

35:33.836 --> 35:35.352
He didn't own just this brothel.

35:35.487 --> 35:37.587
He owned several brothels
in the neighborhood.

35:37.673 --> 35:39.372
Now, I got a photo of him.

35:50.419 --> 35:52.803
Okay.

35:56.909 --> 35:58.458
This is very interesting.

35:59.444 --> 36:03.964
When you guys first arrived,
I was looking at you.

36:04.082 --> 36:06.817
And I was, like, looks really familiar.

36:09.855 --> 36:11.354
What do you think about him?

36:13.559 --> 36:15.775
It makes me shake.

36:15.894 --> 36:18.678
It makes my heart pound,
and it makes my gut hurt.

36:18.797 --> 36:21.548
But do you feel like any kind of,

36:21.667 --> 36:24.000
I don't know, attachment?

36:24.102 --> 36:26.503
I think that I have
a duty here to...

36:28.757 --> 36:30.540
Fulfill something, I don't know what it is.

36:30.642 --> 36:35.645
I bought it the first
day I set foot in there.

36:35.747 --> 36:36.880
'Cause you already owned it.

36:38.383 --> 36:40.250
What the hell are you talking about?

36:41.620 --> 36:44.154
You're this person.

36:48.093 --> 36:50.694
So, you're telling me that
Michael is Joseph Nadeau.

37:08.884 --> 37:13.650
Do you feel, like, any kind
of, I don't know, attachment?

37:13.750 --> 37:17.686
I think that I have a duty
here to fulfill something,

37:17.788 --> 37:18.770
I don't know what it is.

37:19.715 --> 37:23.450
I bought it the first
day I set foot in there.

37:23.535 --> 37:24.667
'Cause you already owned it.

37:26.188 --> 37:27.854
What the hell are you talking about?

37:29.207 --> 37:31.758
You're this person.

37:35.747 --> 37:38.281
So, you're telling me that
Michael is Joseph Nadeau.

37:43.672 --> 37:46.106
Yes.

37:46.191 --> 37:47.273
Was he reincarnated?

37:47.359 --> 37:49.659
Yes.

37:52.164 --> 37:54.180
Whoa.

37:55.283 --> 37:58.301
From the moment
I laid eyes on Michael,

37:58.420 --> 38:01.521
I knew there was something
very familiar about him,

38:01.623 --> 38:04.457
and when he talked about his
obsession with the brothel,

38:04.559 --> 38:06.292
I got even more suspicious.

38:06.378 --> 38:09.629
But when I saw the picture
of the original owner,

38:09.731 --> 38:11.297
it all clicked.

38:11.400 --> 38:13.733
It looks like an older
version of Michael.

38:17.072 --> 38:19.989
Yeah, especially around the eyes.

38:25.964 --> 38:28.348
He looks like my grandfather.

38:28.450 --> 38:30.274
I felt something, though. I knew.

38:30.374 --> 38:33.541
I knew it, but I don't want to feel like

38:33.627 --> 38:36.127
some deceased person, some
spirit, some entity saying,

38:36.213 --> 38:37.512
"You need to do my bidding."

38:37.598 --> 38:40.448
It's not like you're
doing anybody's bidding.

38:40.534 --> 38:41.449
This is you.

38:43.403 --> 38:45.287
This is blowing me away.

38:45.389 --> 38:47.422
I mean, this is one of these
cases I'm gonna walk away from,

38:47.507 --> 38:49.457
and it's gonna be in the back
of my head for a long time.

38:49.543 --> 38:52.377
I'm, like, nervous for
you. I'm scared for you.

38:52.462 --> 38:56.948
I'm in awe of this. I'm
I'm, like, speechless.

38:58.602 --> 39:00.535
My question to you is, though,

39:00.621 --> 39:03.288
do you believe you're this guy?

39:03.407 --> 39:04.723
Yes.

39:06.493 --> 39:08.543
How else do you explain any of it?

39:16.853 --> 39:18.520
Needless to say, this is probably one of

39:18.622 --> 39:20.422
the most unusual cases
that we've worked on.

39:20.557 --> 39:23.558
Now we got to answer the big question.

39:23.660 --> 39:25.794
Is it safe for you to stay here?

39:25.879 --> 39:26.945
According to Amy, for the second time,

39:27.064 --> 39:28.813
and fix this place up?

39:28.899 --> 39:30.615
So for that answer, I'm
gonna turn it over to Amy

39:30.734 --> 39:31.816
and see what she has to say.

39:33.338 --> 39:37.129
Right now, the situation
is not particularly healthy.

39:37.229 --> 39:40.781
Your soul isn't complete

39:40.883 --> 39:46.353
because you're continuing
a life that you had before.

39:46.489 --> 39:52.125
What I think is going on is
that sometimes, when people die,

39:52.228 --> 39:56.663
the soul in its entirety
doesn't completely move on.

39:56.765 --> 39:58.615
So it'll shatter sometimes.

39:58.701 --> 40:00.918
When Joseph died, his soul split.

40:01.036 --> 40:04.838
One piece remained here
in the form of the old man,

40:04.940 --> 40:06.807
and the other became you.

40:06.892 --> 40:11.912
So, what I want you to
do is to find a person

40:12.047 --> 40:18.068
who is a reiki master who has
the ability to collect souls.

40:18.153 --> 40:22.189
And what she does is
absorb them into herself,

40:22.291 --> 40:23.540
and then she releases them.

40:23.659 --> 40:27.661
So, your former self that's here,

40:27.796 --> 40:34.468
she needs to collect that soul,
then needs to move that soul on.

40:34.537 --> 40:36.353
Okay.

40:36.438 --> 40:38.505
One thing I'm a little confused about.

40:38.641 --> 40:40.274
If she takes Nadeau with her,

40:40.359 --> 40:42.993
is he still reincarnated Joe Nadeau?

40:43.078 --> 40:46.613
Yes, but once he moves on,

40:46.715 --> 40:50.467
you may not have an interest
anymore in this place

40:50.553 --> 40:54.922
and completely relinquish that fixation.

40:57.359 --> 41:00.093
Now, what about the
tree lady and the nympho?

41:00.195 --> 41:01.361
What about those people?

41:01.463 --> 41:03.830
The reiki master will be
able to move them on, as well.

41:03.966 --> 41:05.065
Okay.

41:05.150 --> 41:09.019
This stuff is fascinating
when you think about it.

41:09.104 --> 41:12.439
All the pieces, you know,
to this fit together.

41:13.592 --> 41:15.158
Definitely.

41:15.244 --> 41:18.612
I feel like a whole
weight has...

41:20.316 --> 41:22.266
It's like I felt when I
walked in here the first time,

41:22.384 --> 41:24.434
how it took my breath away.

41:24.520 --> 41:27.187
I feel like I can breathe again.

41:27.273 --> 41:29.255
It's gonna be quite the journey.
