Mac: Hey, what's up, coach?

10:36.246 --> 10:37.846
- I.V. in the lounge right now.
- Oh!

10:37.849 --> 10:39.548
- He needs it, all right?
- Not looking good. Yes.

10:39.549 --> 10:41.850
Get some rest. I'll be right in.
I'll be right in.

10:41.852 --> 10:43.251
[Sighs]

11:15.552 --> 11:17.552
Good morning, Mrs. Prince.

11:17.554 --> 11:19.621
- [Knocks]
- Hi.

11:19.624 --> 11:21.823
How are you two feeling?

11:21.826 --> 11:23.491
I hate everything. Can
you shut the door?

11:23.494 --> 11:26.428
Sure, no problem. Look,
I don't want to...

11:26.431 --> 11:29.999
I don't want to overstep
my bounds here, but...

11:30.000 --> 11:35.471
If you need somebody to...
Massage your perineum...

11:35.472 --> 11:38.073
- You're the guy?
- I'm that guy. Dr. Jay.

11:38.076 --> 11:41.644
Oh, my God, Jay. You are so sweet.
Thank you so much for stepping up.

11:41.645 --> 11:45.748
You're welcome. So, what's up?

11:46.984 --> 11:49.217
Hassan pulled out of the fight.

11:51.020 --> 11:54.423
He says he strained his MCL.

11:57.293 --> 12:00.096
Doing what? I mean, getting
out of fucking bed?

12:00.097 --> 12:02.365
- I know.
- It's the day of the fight, Lisa!

12:02.366 --> 12:04.033
His manager called
Garo this morning.

12:04.034 --> 12:05.167
I-I'm sorry.

12:05.168 --> 12:07.035
I know that you're disappointed.

12:07.038 --> 12:09.371
- [Slams phone]
- Fuck disappointment!

12:09.374 --> 12:14.275
Are you kidding me? This is the
second time in four months, Lisa!

12:14.278 --> 12:15.610
What the fuck?!

12:15.613 --> 12:17.645
This is a business
decision for these guys.

12:17.648 --> 12:20.048
You're a great fighter
with an average record.

12:20.051 --> 12:21.549
There's no upside
to fighting you.

12:21.552 --> 12:23.152
What do you want me to do
with this information?!

12:23.153 --> 12:25.354
I fuck up, I don't get a fight.

12:25.355 --> 12:28.024
I do great, I still
don't get a fight.

12:28.025 --> 12:29.125
I'm a little confused.

12:29.126 --> 12:30.692
I know. Jay, it sucks.

12:30.695 --> 12:32.695
- It sucks?
- Yeah.

12:32.697 --> 12:35.463
Hmm. What the fuck are
you doing about it?

12:35.466 --> 12:37.466
- I'm working on it.
- How?

12:37.467 --> 12:40.336
I don't know. I... But
I'll figure it out, okay?

12:40.337 --> 12:43.072
You'll figure it fucking out?
You want to manage me?

12:43.073 --> 12:44.673
- You want to be my manager?
- Yes.

12:44.674 --> 12:47.643
Then manage to get
me a fucking fight.

12:47.644 --> 12:52.313
Jesus fuck! Fuck!

12:54.484 --> 12:56.519
- Mac: Hit him right in the throat.
- [Chuckles]

12:56.520 --> 12:59.522
He dropped like somebody unplugged him.
It was awesome.

12:59.524 --> 13:01.490
And then, uh... And
then Jay humped me.

13:01.491 --> 13:04.059
I got video on my phone
if you want to see it.

13:04.062 --> 13:05.528
- Oh, man.
- Check this out.

13:05.529 --> 13:07.062
Alvey: How's my guy?

13:07.065 --> 13:08.663
Uh, good. I just, uh...

13:08.666 --> 13:11.366
He just started the
second bag of fluids.

13:11.369 --> 13:13.668
You're good to go
tonight, right?

13:13.671 --> 13:15.004
Yeah, I think so.

13:15.005 --> 13:16.337
You think so, or you know so?

13:16.340 --> 13:17.173
'Cause Morant's a tough
son of a bitch, man.

13:17.174 --> 13:18.374
He could hurt you.

13:18.375 --> 13:21.342
No, there's sponsors coming tonight.
I'm not gonna pull out of the fight.

13:21.345 --> 13:23.446
- You sure?
- I'm good.

13:25.215 --> 13:27.615
- I'm just gonna sleep.
- You need some food, too.

13:27.618 --> 13:29.350
A little solid food,
try to keep it down.

13:29.352 --> 13:30.351
- Mac.
- Mac: Yeah?

13:30.354 --> 13:31.620
Alvey.

13:33.023 --> 13:35.224
Did you know about my
fight falling apart?

13:35.225 --> 13:38.094
I just found out. I just
found out, and I'm sorry.

13:38.096 --> 13:39.562
What happened to Hassan?

13:39.563 --> 13:42.264
Hassan... fucking Hassan, all
of a sudden, has an MLC.

13:42.265 --> 13:43.566
Ah, ah, easy.

13:43.567 --> 13:45.301
What, they can't...
There's nobody else?

13:45.302 --> 13:47.269
Nobody. I take all.
Nobody takes me.

13:47.270 --> 13:49.572
All right, Lisa's gonna
handle the situation, okay?

13:49.573 --> 13:51.373
- [Spits]
- Just relax.

13:51.375 --> 13:53.042
Don't get yourself crazy.

13:53.043 --> 13:55.845
- It's sucks.
- [Humming]

13:57.279 --> 13:59.782
I'm not even fucking
worried about it

13:59.783 --> 14:01.583
'cause tonight is about you.

14:01.586 --> 14:05.287
Yes, sir. Yes, champ.
Tonight is about you.

14:05.288 --> 14:08.657
I'm gonna go home. Mackles,
you're coming with me.

14:08.658 --> 14:13.629
I'm gonna have a burrito. I'm
gonna have a few Martinis.

14:13.630 --> 14:16.164
I'm gonna put on my finery.

14:16.167 --> 14:18.267
And I am going to cheer for you

14:18.269 --> 14:23.471
like a Peruvian girl at a Michael Jackson
concert, 'cause you know I love you.

14:23.474 --> 14:26.307
I'll see you tonight... Champ.

14:26.309 --> 14:27.743
All right.

14:31.148 --> 14:33.182
I might even love you.

14:33.183 --> 14:36.284
- Oh, shit.
- Yes, sir.

14:36.287 --> 14:39.187
Mac, when you've concluded
your nursing services,

14:39.190 --> 14:41.624
I expect to see you
back at the chalet.

14:41.625 --> 14:44.493
- Kick some ass tonight, bro.
- Sorry, bud.

14:44.495 --> 14:46.327
[Grunting]

14:46.330 --> 14:48.397
- Fuck!
- I fucked up the toast.

14:57.706 --> 14:59.475
Oh, yeah.

14:59.476 --> 15:01.210
I need you to work a
double next week.

15:01.211 --> 15:02.778
No. What? No.

15:02.779 --> 15:05.714
I don't want to work a double.
I worked two last week.

15:05.716 --> 15:07.482
Tim's got mono.

15:07.485 --> 15:10.818
- What about Chauncey?
- He's out of town.

15:10.821 --> 15:15.791
- Well, what about Madison?
- She ain't gonna do it.

15:15.793 --> 15:18.626
She never has to do anything.

15:18.629 --> 15:22.865
Seriously, has she ever
cleaned the grill? No.

15:22.866 --> 15:26.235
Has she ever emptied
the grease trap? No.

15:26.236 --> 15:30.206
She's in school. She
works 15 hours a week.

15:30.207 --> 15:32.374
But I'm trying to help you out.

15:32.375 --> 15:35.878
Oh, lucky me. A double.
Thank you.

15:37.514 --> 15:40.381
You always give me
the worst schedule.

15:41.750 --> 15:44.519
Why you always got a problem?

15:44.522 --> 15:48.591
You keep saying you want hours.
I'm giving you more hours.

15:48.592 --> 15:50.359
What the hell you want?

15:50.360 --> 15:52.595
[Sighs]

15:52.596 --> 15:54.663
Nothing.

15:56.265 --> 15:58.334
I'll do it.

15:59.402 --> 16:01.769
[Gun clicking]

16:01.772 --> 16:03.772
How badass is that thing?

16:03.774 --> 16:05.374
Nate: Yeah, this
is very practical.

16:05.375 --> 16:06.875
You definitely
needed to buy this.

16:06.876 --> 16:08.210
[Chuckles]

16:08.211 --> 16:09.745
When the shit goes
down, Sonny boy,

16:09.746 --> 16:12.280
you're gonna be running
to big Papa's house.

16:12.283 --> 16:13.615
Big Papa's house.

16:13.618 --> 16:15.918
[Chuckles] Here. Help me out.

16:18.288 --> 16:20.556
I'm trying to get
more tape on Barnes.

16:20.557 --> 16:21.690
I've seen enough.

16:21.692 --> 16:25.193
- Well, it can't hurt to see more.
- You're right.

16:27.397 --> 16:30.732
Lisa's gonna set up some press for
you the week before the fight.

16:30.735 --> 16:32.634
I know you hate it, but
first fight back...

16:32.636 --> 16:33.936
No, I'll do it. It's fine.

16:33.937 --> 16:35.403
Yeah?

16:35.405 --> 16:36.605
Yeah.

16:36.606 --> 16:37.605
What?

16:37.607 --> 16:40.609
You're very relaxed.
It's disturbing.

16:40.610 --> 16:42.745
I'm not taking this guy
lightly or anything.

16:42.746 --> 16:44.779
I'm just fucking ready to fight.

16:44.782 --> 16:46.715
I know you are. You
busted your ass.

16:46.716 --> 16:48.417
I'm proud as hell of you.

16:48.418 --> 16:49.618
Thank you.

16:49.620 --> 16:52.020
You're not in your head.
I like that.

16:54.323 --> 16:56.725
You're off that
shit, too, right?

16:57.826 --> 17:00.663
The HGH that you think
I didn't know about?

17:02.631 --> 17:05.300
I know you had an injury
and it was necessary,

17:05.303 --> 17:08.470
but you get popped, and that
follows you your whole career.

17:08.471 --> 17:10.471
So we are done with that, yeah?

17:10.473 --> 17:12.740
We're done. I'm off it.
I'm clean. I swear.

17:13.809 --> 17:15.678
Handsome kid.

17:15.680 --> 17:17.980
Go see if, uh, Ryan
needs anything, okay?

17:17.981 --> 17:19.515
Yeah.

17:19.517 --> 17:21.348
- You good?
- Yeah.

17:21.352 --> 17:23.050
All right.

17:25.454 --> 17:27.588
Nothing's loaded.

17:30.460 --> 17:33.595
Don't forget we're going to see
Garo to look at that Brazilian.

17:33.596 --> 17:36.798
- Where are you going?
- To go and see another fighter.

17:36.800 --> 17:40.669
- Anyone I know?
- Alicia Mendez?

17:40.671 --> 17:42.637
She's young.

17:42.640 --> 17:44.839
Mm, young's good.

17:47.977 --> 17:49.877
You gonna bring those home?

17:49.880 --> 17:52.780
I'm not gonna leave them
in a gym full of maniacs.

17:52.782 --> 17:54.717
See you there.

17:54.719 --> 17:56.617
Okay. Bye.

17:57.886 --> 18:00.055
[Ringtone playing]

18:00.057 --> 18:01.957
Ah, fuck.

18:01.959 --> 18:03.925
[Ringtone stops]

18:05.894 --> 18:08.797
[Music playing]

18:22.479 --> 18:24.480
- Motherfucker!
- [Horn honks]

18:24.481 --> 18:25.748
Fuck!

18:36.659 --> 18:38.861
So, where are you training now?

18:38.863 --> 18:41.497
At Team Elite in
North Hollywood.

18:41.499 --> 18:43.365
Just trying to get out of there.

18:43.366 --> 18:45.067
It's a good gym.
You're not happy?

18:45.068 --> 18:47.702
[Sighs] It's all right.

18:47.704 --> 18:51.339
You know, it's just...
It's not the right fit.

18:51.342 --> 18:53.942
Why, did Marco try to fuck you?

18:53.943 --> 18:55.411
[Chuckles]

18:56.512 --> 18:58.380
He kept asking me out to dinner.

18:58.382 --> 19:01.849
And then you keep saying no and
then he'll cancel your privates

19:01.852 --> 19:03.551
and no one wants
to roll with you

19:03.554 --> 19:05.921
and then you're the lonely girl
in the corner hitting a bag.

19:05.923 --> 19:08.690
That's pretty much
exactly how it happened.

19:08.692 --> 19:10.459
Or it could be that
he's lost interest

19:10.461 --> 19:12.795
'cause you've lost your
last three fights in a row.

19:14.596 --> 19:18.400
- Yeah, maybe.
- It's not.

19:18.402 --> 19:21.470
It's the not fucking him, but
your record isn't helping.

19:21.471 --> 19:24.640
I'm sorry. Why did you
even call me here?

19:24.642 --> 19:26.375
I want to sign you.

19:26.376 --> 19:30.112
I think you're a really talented fighter
who's gotten some really bad advice,

19:30.114 --> 19:33.915
or maybe none at all, and I
want to change all that.

19:33.917 --> 19:37.952
What do you mean? I mean,
what can you get me?

19:37.954 --> 19:41.390
Right now? Probably nothing.

19:41.392 --> 19:45.394
Look. You're 1-3, and you're
not getting any better.

19:45.395 --> 19:49.330
You're taking bad fights with girls
with way too much experience.

19:49.333 --> 19:51.467
Well, Marco says I need
to take what I can get.

19:51.469 --> 19:53.634
Yeah, no, and if you
keep doing that,

19:53.636 --> 19:55.971
uh, you'll end up
fighting in Palm Springs

19:55.972 --> 19:57.739
until you're mercy-killed
by the commissioner.

19:57.740 --> 20:00.576
Well, how else am I supposed to get
experience if I don't take a fight?

20:00.577 --> 20:02.478
My job is to build your career.

20:02.480 --> 20:05.681
I'm gonna find you the right
fights at the right time.

20:05.682 --> 20:08.016
The sponsors and all that
shit will come later.

20:08.018 --> 20:11.752
You're a beautiful girl, but that's
not gonna happen without a plan.

20:13.423 --> 20:16.357
If I go with you, will I be
able to train with Alvey?

20:16.359 --> 20:19.528
I can't promise that,
but he'll evaluate you.

20:20.273 --> 20:24.732
I told him about you, and, uh, he's
hoping you'll come by the gym.

20:27.703 --> 20:29.872
[Snorts]

20:29.874 --> 20:32.207
Mac: Ohh!

20:34.877 --> 20:37.445
Yeah, I miss your
old house, man.

20:37.448 --> 20:40.481
Fuck my old house, dude.
I like this place.

20:40.483 --> 20:42.550
I get my own space here, Mac.

20:42.552 --> 20:44.619
Ohh! [Inhales sharply]

20:44.622 --> 20:46.188
Ohh!

20:47.624 --> 20:52.693
I got... I got my own theories
about this whole fucking thing.

20:52.695 --> 20:54.630
- [Snorts]
- What thing?

20:54.632 --> 20:59.034
You know, about the whole business
industrial complex of the sport.

20:59.036 --> 21:00.669
Sport, you know? See?

21:00.671 --> 21:03.571
It's fucking... It's like
I'm a fighter, dude.

21:03.574 --> 21:04.972
I'm a fucking fighter.

21:04.974 --> 21:06.575
[British accent] I'm
not a sportsman, sir.

21:06.576 --> 21:07.808
[Normal voice] Jesus.

21:07.810 --> 21:11.145
- Have you ever read Sigmund Freud?
- I know who he is.

21:11.147 --> 21:14.482
He's fucking amazing, man.

21:14.484 --> 21:17.986
For instance, do you
ever get depressed?

21:17.988 --> 21:19.587
Huh? [Sniffs]

21:19.589 --> 21:21.490
When I think about my
grandpa, all right?

21:21.491 --> 21:22.990
Like, uh, he was
more like a father.

21:22.992 --> 21:25.027
No, Mac, I'm saying, like,
for no fucking reason,

21:25.028 --> 21:29.597
like you're sitting in your house and you
can't manage to do another fucking thing.

21:29.599 --> 21:30.898
You can't motivate.

21:30.901 --> 21:33.701
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
I know what that is.

21:33.703 --> 21:34.936
That's fucking Freud, dude.

21:34.939 --> 21:38.673
That is anxiety, and you're having it
because you are suppressing your impulses.

21:38.675 --> 21:40.608
- [Snorts]
- All the shit that is built into you...

21:40.611 --> 21:42.877
Fucking, fighting, surviving...
All the animal shit.

21:42.880 --> 21:46.048
Um, but, however, the...
We have to have that,

21:46.049 --> 21:49.550
otherwise, you cannot have
a functioning society

21:49.552 --> 21:51.219
'cause you're gonna get
motherfuckers like me

21:51.221 --> 21:53.888
who go around stealing everyone's
fucking property and women.

21:53.891 --> 21:57.692
You have to suppress. Yeah.

21:57.694 --> 22:00.127
[Snorts]

22:03.967 --> 22:07.134
Uh, uh, it just makes...
Makes me really sad.

22:07.136 --> 22:09.770
You know, fuck, man.

22:09.772 --> 22:11.272
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- That's what I'm saying.

22:11.275 --> 22:12.641
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey.

22:12.643 --> 22:14.643
Hey, no. No, no, no.

22:14.644 --> 22:17.712
What are we talking about, Jay?

22:21.084 --> 22:22.784
Wh...

22:22.786 --> 22:24.619
What?

22:24.622 --> 22:27.788
What... what... what...
What I'm talking...

22:27.790 --> 22:31.727
What we're talking
about, Mac, is that...

22:32.729 --> 22:34.663
- What?
- Look, I'm...

22:34.664 --> 22:37.566
I'm... I'm...

22:38.968 --> 22:41.836
Everybody's too fucking careful.

22:43.138 --> 22:45.807
F-Fighters fight, dude.

22:45.808 --> 22:49.845
Fuck! That's all they do.

22:49.846 --> 22:51.680
Huh?

22:51.682 --> 22:53.248
True statement?

22:53.250 --> 22:56.250
Hmm? "T" or "F," fucking Mac?

22:56.252 --> 22:57.752
Yeah, I get... I agree.

22:57.755 --> 23:02.190
Ga-Ga-Ga, you sound,
um, uh, dubious.

23:02.192 --> 23:04.692
It's... it's an
oversimplification.

23:04.694 --> 23:08.829
See? That's the infection
right there, dude.

23:08.832 --> 23:15.202
Hassan is... Fucking Hassan's trying
to curate his record, and, yeah.

23:15.204 --> 23:17.105
No, that's bullshit, dude.

23:17.106 --> 23:22.044
Hassan's fucking stealing from
me, Mac, by bitching out.

23:22.046 --> 23:24.779
And that...

23:24.781 --> 23:26.548
[Sighs]

23:26.549 --> 23:27.982
It gives me anxiety, man.

23:27.984 --> 23:30.051
It gives me fucking anxiety.

23:30.054 --> 23:32.019
[Sniffs]

23:32.021 --> 23:34.690
Should we clean this all up
before your Mom comes home?

23:34.692 --> 23:36.124
Go... hey, hey...

23:36.125 --> 23:38.292
Dude, my Mom's working
a fucking doble today.

23:38.295 --> 23:41.863
Line it up, Mac, with your
fucking forearms, dude.

23:41.865 --> 23:44.900
I want to march to fucking
Bolivia and back, motherfucker.

23:44.902 --> 23:47.068
Get that shit going.

23:47.070 --> 23:50.137
We have a really
long night, Jay.

23:50.140 --> 23:51.873
All right, dude. We
got to set a pace.

23:51.875 --> 23:53.741
We got to make it all
the way to the end.

23:53.743 --> 23:56.243
This is my fucking pace, Mac.

23:56.246 --> 23:58.212
You will not fucking
suppress me.

23:58.214 --> 24:00.848
I'm Martin Luther King, dude.
Watch out, bro.

24:00.851 --> 24:03.018
That... You cannot say that.

24:03.019 --> 24:05.319
[Moaning]

24:05.321 --> 24:07.788
[Siren wailing]

24:15.698 --> 24:18.032
Christina: I get the worst
hours of anybody there.

24:18.035 --> 24:21.769
"If nobody wants to work that
shift, give it to Christina."

24:21.771 --> 24:24.940
In the meantime, this Madison
girl, who has gigantic boobs,

24:24.942 --> 24:27.041
has Jamal wrapped
around her finger.

24:27.044 --> 24:29.044
I wouldn't be surprised if
<i>she'</i> making the schedule.

24:29.046 --> 24:31.113
Why don't you just tell this guy
what hours you want to work?

24:31.115 --> 24:33.949
It doesn't work that way, honey.
Haven't you ever had a job?

24:36.352 --> 24:38.220
That's actually not good.

24:38.221 --> 24:39.954
I get paid to fight.

24:39.957 --> 24:43.692
Yeah, but you need to know what
it feels like to have a boss.

24:43.693 --> 24:45.760
Why do I need to know that?

24:45.762 --> 24:49.765
Well, pardon me, Your Highness.

24:49.767 --> 24:52.000
You're getting a little cocky.

24:53.236 --> 24:56.104
It's actually very attractive, Nate.
Women like it.

24:56.105 --> 24:59.307
That's good to know, Mom.
Thank you.

25:01.943 --> 25:04.813
- How's Casey?
- She's good.

25:04.815 --> 25:07.982
Hmm? You two doing okay?

25:07.984 --> 25:09.951
All good.

25:09.952 --> 25:13.821
She's not going crazy
with you training?

25:13.824 --> 25:16.825
No drinking, no
good food, no sex?

25:16.826 --> 25:20.162
- Are you almost done with that?
- Almost.

25:24.767 --> 25:28.135
Is your brother ready
for his fight tonight?

25:28.137 --> 25:30.305
The guy pulled out.

25:30.307 --> 25:34.375
- Oh. That's too bad.
- Yeah, it sucks.

25:35.944 --> 25:38.145
So... so, is he gonna
be home tonight?

25:38.147 --> 25:40.080
We're gonna watch Ryan.

25:40.083 --> 25:41.849
Hmm.

25:41.852 --> 25:45.586
Well, I guess I'll just have
the house to myself... Again.

25:48.758 --> 25:51.926
No, I'm not fishing
for an invitation.

25:51.929 --> 25:54.762
I'll just sit at
home and do my nails

25:54.765 --> 25:58.465
like some old retired lady
whose friends have all died.

25:58.468 --> 26:01.869
You're not retired. You
work at the Patty Palace.

26:01.872 --> 26:03.204
You're a little jerk.

26:03.207 --> 26:04.271
[Chuckles]

26:06.375 --> 26:08.876
So, I'll leave some tickets
for you at will call...

26:08.878 --> 26:12.146
And then just text me when you're there,
and I'll bring you back to meet everyone.

26:12.148 --> 26:17.719
- Hey, are you married?
- No, but, uh, we're together.

26:17.721 --> 26:19.186
It's Alvey's.

26:19.189 --> 26:23.557
[Chuckles] Any other
questions for me?

26:23.559 --> 26:25.794
Look, I'm gonna be
straight up with you.

26:25.796 --> 26:28.529
I really like you, and I
think this could be great.

26:28.531 --> 26:32.000
I just...Wonder what's gonna
happen when the baby's born.

26:32.001 --> 26:33.201
What do you mean?

26:33.202 --> 26:34.869
When you're busy
being mom, I mean,

26:34.872 --> 26:35.903
who's gonna be making
phone calls for me?

26:35.905 --> 26:37.372
Me.

26:37.374 --> 26:39.974
Nothing's going to change.
All I need is a phone.

26:44.012 --> 26:46.314
Oh, shit, you parked in the red.

26:46.316 --> 26:47.414
[Scoffs]

26:47.416 --> 26:49.951
There's nowhere to park.

26:51.354 --> 26:52.820
Thanks for lunch.

26:52.823 --> 26:54.521

27:19.115 --> 27:21.249
[Screaming continues]

27:46.608 --> 27:48.542
Alvey: There he is.

27:48.545 --> 27:49.911
Do you got everything?

27:49.913 --> 27:50.979
[Engine turns over]

27:50.980 --> 27:52.480
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

27:52.481 --> 27:54.915
All right, come on. Let's go.

27:54.917 --> 27:56.384
Eddie: This is the
way he put it...

27:56.385 --> 27:58.552
He says, like, a shark bit
off half his asshole.

27:58.555 --> 28:00.422
- Lisa: Eddie.
- Hey!

28:00.423 --> 28:02.624
- Where's Garo?
- Lisa. Hey, you look good.

28:02.625 --> 28:04.592
Uh, Garo had a bit of a health scare.
You got me tonight.

28:04.594 --> 28:06.827
- I'm running things. Hey.
- What happened?

28:06.829 --> 28:09.230
He has what's called
an anal fistula.

28:09.231 --> 28:10.832
How did he des... Kind of like a...
like a...

28:10.834 --> 28:12.599
- It's okay.
- ...Like an abscess...

28:12.602 --> 28:14.301
- No, no, no, you don't have to...
- ...In the asshole... Region?

28:14.304 --> 28:16.304
- Honestly, please, please, please.
- I'm so sorry.

28:16.306 --> 28:18.839
That's disgusting. What are
we gonna do about Jay?

28:18.842 --> 28:20.575
Ohh, I am so sorry about Jay.

28:20.576 --> 28:21.977
Mm-hmm.

28:21.979 --> 28:23.345
What are you gonna do?
It happens.

28:23.346 --> 28:25.113
No, it doesn't happen.

28:25.115 --> 28:26.513
- You guys got to lock down these fighters.
- Locked.

28:26.516 --> 28:27.982
- It's getting ridiculous.
- I hear you.

28:27.984 --> 28:30.518
- And also, just a little FYI...
- What's that?

28:30.519 --> 28:32.019
- Jay's on the rampage.
- Whoa.

28:32.021 --> 28:33.488
Why are you pointing at me?

28:33.490 --> 28:35.190
Hassan fucked him over.
It's not us, all right?

28:35.192 --> 28:36.357
- We're hurting, too.
- Fix it.

28:36.359 --> 28:38.125
Alvey: Whoa, whoa,
whoa, what's going on?

28:38.127 --> 28:39.361
Hey! There he is!

28:39.363 --> 28:40.627
What are you doing here?
Where's Garo?

28:40.630 --> 28:42.931
Uh, his fistula went
ape-shit this morning.

28:42.932 --> 28:44.465
- [Imitates explosion]
- Stop, stop, stop.

28:44.468 --> 28:46.101
Stopping.

28:46.103 --> 28:47.434
Where are these Brazilians
I'm supposed to see?

28:47.436 --> 28:49.336
Follow me, my friend. Follow me.

28:49.338 --> 28:51.038
Garo thinks you're
gonna love this guy.

28:51.040 --> 28:52.539
23 years old. Tough,
mean son of a bitch.

28:52.541 --> 28:55.042
Raised like a dog straight
out of the favelas, right?

28:55.045 --> 28:57.311
And get this... this guy,
he can't even fucking read.

28:57.314 --> 28:58.980
I don't care if he can read.
I just want to see him.

28:58.981 --> 29:01.482
- Ah! Fabricio!

29:01.484 --> 29:04.019

29:04.020 --> 29:05.886
Ah, just kidding, man.
Just kidding, right?

29:05.888 --> 29:07.955
Hey, how you doing? Alvey Kulina.
Nice to see you.

29:07.958 --> 29:09.289
- Right?
- How are you?

29:09.291 --> 29:10.991
This guy's a fucking beast, huh?
Beast.

29:10.993 --> 29:12.559
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

29:12.561 --> 29:14.194

- What? No, man. No, not a word.

29:14.196 --> 29:15.663
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm positive.

29:15.664 --> 29:17.231
- I'm positive.
- I know this guy, man.

29:17.233 --> 29:18.665
He's been knocking around
for a couple years.

29:18.667 --> 29:20.134
No, no, no. You're
thinking of somebody else.

29:20.136 --> 29:22.069
- No.
- Somebody else. He's new.

29:22.071 --> 29:23.337
- [Speaks Spanish]
- Yeah.

29:23.339 --> 29:25.073
Look at him. He's like
a piece of jerky.

29:25.075 --> 29:26.540
He's 23 like I'm 23.

29:26.542 --> 29:28.410
He's too old. I got no
time to train him, okay?

29:28.412 --> 29:29.676
Maybe he's 25, 26.

29:29.679 --> 29:32.047
Tell Garo not to waste
my fucking time.

29:32.048 --> 29:35.150
And, idiot, he speaks
Portuguese, not Spanish, okay?

29:35.152 --> 29:37.018
Okay, first of all, same thing.

29:37.019 --> 29:40.355
Second of all, Garo
specifically inst... Al...

29:40.356 --> 29:42.222
All right. Fuck!

29:42.224 --> 29:44.759
[Speaking Spanish]

29:49.098 --> 29:51.031
Fuck me.

got that new job.</i>

[TV shuts off]

29:58.007 --> 30:00.808
[Siren wailing in distance]

30:10.419 --> 30:13.253
It's a nice house, yeah.
No, it's cool.

30:13.256 --> 30:15.522
What's that? How's the fistula?

30:15.525 --> 30:17.258
[Chuckles] What's that?

30:17.259 --> 30:19.227
No, it's good. It's good.

30:19.229 --> 30:21.128
Yeah, it's a good house.
It's full.

30:21.131 --> 30:22.430
I mean...

30:22.432 --> 30:25.133
What's that? No. I
talked to Lisa.

30:25.134 --> 30:26.366
Yeah.

30:26.368 --> 30:28.103
Hey. Hey, pal.

30:28.105 --> 30:29.604
- Hold on a second.
- Hey, okay.

30:29.605 --> 30:31.772
- What?
- Do you know where Garo is, by any chance?

30:31.775 --> 30:33.474
- Yeah, I'm on the phone right now.
- Oh.

30:33.477 --> 30:35.210
- Yeah, he's helping.
- Hey, Garo, it's Jay.

30:35.211 --> 30:36.778
- Yeah, let me call you back.
- How you doing?

30:36.779 --> 30:38.579
Garo, let me call you back.

30:38.582 --> 30:40.147
- I feel like this is his fight promotion.
- How's it going, Jay?

30:40.150 --> 30:41.482
-  Yeah, it is.
- No, I'm doing all right.

30:41.484 --> 30:43.050
- He's home sick.
- He had a bit of a...

30:43.052 --> 30:44.285
- Oh, shit.
- ...Fistula thing.

30:44.287 --> 30:45.752
It doesn't matter.
Good to see you.

30:45.755 --> 30:47.387
Hey, sorry about the fight, all right?
I talked to Lisa.

30:47.390 --> 30:49.723
- We're gonna take care of you, okay?
- Great, yeah.

30:49.726 --> 30:51.459
How do... how do... how do you
figure you're gonna do that?

30:51.461 --> 30:52.594
I don't know. We're gonna get
you on a big card, all right?

30:52.596 --> 30:54.394
-  Big card.
- Big card. Big card.

30:54.396 --> 30:56.631
But maybe... maybe I don't
want to be on your big card.

30:56.633 --> 30:58.732
Maybe a fighter such as
myself deserves better

30:58.734 --> 31:00.768
- than your ghetto-ass fucking promotion.
- Step back a little bit, Jay.

31:00.769 --> 31:03.270
These are the thoughts that
start going through my mind

31:03.272 --> 31:05.140
- when you deny me my fucking right to work.
- You know what? Fuck you, Jay.

31:05.142 --> 31:06.807
- Oh, "fuck you"?
- You just crossed the line, all right?

31:06.809 --> 31:08.276
- I will take a little shit from you.
- I will fucking...

31:08.278 --> 31:09.611
I will eat a little bit of shit...
a bite...

31:09.613 --> 31:11.512
- But that's it, all right?
- Okay, we're good.

31:11.515 --> 31:12.846
- Back the fuck up right now.
- Jay, we're good. Jay, we're good.

- I got to go. Good luck.
- We're good.

31:14.151 --> 31:15.282
I need you to control your boy.

31:15.285 --> 31:16.416
What the fuck you just say?

31:16.419 --> 31:18.185

42:17.280 --> 42:19.112
I was provoked.

42:19.114 --> 42:22.148
Nate, can you make daddy
a cocktail, please?

42:22.150 --> 42:24.284
Please, please.

42:24.286 --> 42:28.255
Well, I guess you
got your fight.

42:28.257 --> 42:31.324
[Inhales sharply] Yeah.

42:31.327 --> 42:33.427
[Grunts]

42:33.429 --> 42:35.695
How was your night?

42:35.697 --> 42:39.065
It was nice. I meditated.

42:41.969 --> 42:43.938
I'll make you a drink.

42:46.106 --> 42:48.375
You would do that for me?

42:48.376 --> 42:50.210
What do you want?

42:52.047 --> 42:55.382
I would like some rum... Please.

42:56.784 --> 42:58.351
Coming right up.

43:02.023 --> 43:04.224
Ahh.

43:04.226 --> 43:06.893
You're a wonderful mother.

43:06.896 --> 43:11.130
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

43:11.132 --> 43:14.201
[Sighs]

43:15.903 --> 43:17.371
[Cellphone vibrating]

43:17.373 --> 43:18.972
Alvey: Fuck.

43:18.974 --> 43:22.543
I keep getting this unknown caller.
They won't leave a message.

43:22.545 --> 43:25.545
- Answer it.
- No.

43:25.547 --> 43:27.614
I don't fucking
talk to strangers.

43:29.550 --> 43:32.385
- Come here.
- Alvey, no.

43:32.387 --> 43:34.088
Come here.

43:34.090 --> 43:35.856
Come here.

43:35.858 --> 43:39.159
Come to daddy. Come here.

43:39.161 --> 43:40.827
- I can't. I can't.
- What?

43:40.829 --> 43:43.097
It's the scotch. You
smell like scotch.

43:43.099 --> 43:45.365
[Scoffs]

43:45.367 --> 43:47.501
Don't be sensitive.
It's not you.

43:47.503 --> 43:49.570
It's... Everything
makes me sick.

43:49.572 --> 43:52.039
Yeah. Oh, thanks.
Makes me feel better.

43:52.041 --> 43:54.041
I'm not gonna take
it personally.

43:54.043 --> 43:56.076
You can take it a
little personally.

43:56.077 --> 43:57.378
Oh.

43:57.380 --> 43:59.914
[Chuckles]

44:05.387 --> 44:08.255
I want you to take a look
at this girl Alicia.

44:08.257 --> 44:09.657
I think she's special.

44:12.527 --> 44:14.094
Okay, after Nate's fight.

44:14.096 --> 44:16.931
No, I know. I just... I want
you to take her seriously.

44:16.932 --> 44:19.967
I will. I'll give
her a look-see.

44:19.969 --> 44:22.001
Thank you.

44:24.438 --> 44:26.373
Come over here.

44:37.985 --> 44:40.086
Come here.

44:40.088 --> 44:41.989
Hmm?

44:41.990 --> 44:44.224
- Oh, my God, no.
- Ohh.

44:44.226 --> 44:47.293
- What?
- I'm sorry.

44:47.295 --> 44:49.429
- It's that bad?
- Mm-hmm.

44:49.431 --> 44:52.032
I'm going to bed.

44:53.068 --> 44:55.135
Good night.

44:58.005 --> 45:02.041
- Congrats on the win.
- Yay.

45:09.516 --> 45:12.085
[Groans]

45:18.025 --> 45:20.226
[Music playing]

45:22.931 --> 45:24.630
[Door closes]

45:24.632 --> 45:26.532
- Alvey in his office?
- Yes.

45:26.534 --> 45:28.869
Fantastic. Thank you.
Don't change anything.

45:28.871 --> 45:30.536
You're perfect.

45:33.440 --> 45:35.675
Hey. How's the asshole?

45:35.677 --> 45:38.211
Fucking miserable. The
worst pain of my life.

45:38.213 --> 45:40.179
Take care of your ass while
you still can, my friend.

45:40.181 --> 45:41.382
[Both chuckle]

45:41.384 --> 45:42.882
[Grunts]

45:42.885 --> 45:44.150
Oh, boy.

45:44.152 --> 45:45.452
[Sighs]

45:45.454 --> 45:47.387
What's that in your hand?

45:47.389 --> 45:48.688
[Sighs]

45:48.690 --> 45:52.358
I got the pre-fight
test back this morning.

45:52.360 --> 45:54.961
Ryan popped.

45:54.963 --> 45:58.132
- For what?
- Cocaine.

46:00.099 --> 46:05.041
Okay. I can't get a break.

46:08.476 --> 46:10.677
[Sighs] Who else knows?

46:10.679 --> 46:12.311
Just me for now.

46:12.313 --> 46:13.514
Fuck you, "for now."
What are you gonna do?

46:13.516 --> 46:15.081
Are you gonna leverage me?

46:15.083 --> 46:18.284
I'm gonna help you. Forget his career.
This could put him back in prison.

46:22.157 --> 46:24.291
[Sighs]

46:26.661 --> 46:29.663
Son of a bitch.
What do you want?

46:29.664 --> 46:33.166
I want Ryan to sign with King Beast
Promotions for the next six fights.

46:33.168 --> 46:34.434
- Six fights?
- Six fights.

46:34.436 --> 46:37.403
- How much?
- The same as he made for his last fight.

46:37.405 --> 46:38.704
- Get out of here.
- Come on. Best I can do.

46:38.706 --> 46:40.373
I can't lock this kid
up for no money.

46:40.376 --> 46:42.543
It's the best I can do, Alvey.

46:42.545 --> 46:44.610
- Three fights.
- Three fights?

46:44.612 --> 46:46.380
Three fights. Do three fights.

46:46.382 --> 46:47.748
- Alvey.
- Do three fights.

46:47.750 --> 46:49.416
I have to bury that test.
Cocaine.

46:49.418 --> 46:52.286
I have to hide it from the
commission and possibly the police.

46:52.288 --> 46:53.554
How long we known each other?

46:53.556 --> 46:55.054
How much business
we do together?

46:55.056 --> 46:56.722
You're gonna leak this?
You're gonna fuck me?

46:56.724 --> 46:58.391
- Alvey. Alvey.
- All these years, you're gonna fuck me?

46:58.393 --> 47:00.226
I'm not gonna fuck you.
I'm gonna help you.

47:00.228 --> 47:02.463
I have to bury this test, okay?

47:02.465 --> 47:06.400
And I can't do that alone, which
means I can't do it for free.

47:06.402 --> 47:08.268
It has to be six fights.

47:08.269 --> 47:10.237
There's nothing I can do.
My hands are tied.

47:10.239 --> 47:13.239
Listen, Alvey, sometimes you
have to be on the receiving end.

47:13.242 --> 47:15.141
All in all, it's not a bad deal.

47:15.143 --> 47:16.742
For you, it's a good deal.

47:16.744 --> 47:19.045
For me and for him so he doesn't
have to go back to prison

47:19.047 --> 47:23.282
and for you because you hold on to your
golden boy and you get to work with me.

47:23.284 --> 47:25.085
[Scoffs]

47:25.086 --> 47:27.121
Alvey, I'm not the bad guy.

47:27.123 --> 47:30.757
I'm not your problem. Ryan
is your problem, right?

47:30.759 --> 47:32.659
Okay.

47:32.661 --> 47:36.163
[Straining] I have to go...
Back to the doctor's.

47:36.164 --> 47:38.331
Nobody sees this.

47:38.333 --> 47:42.001
Trust me. I'm gonna
make it go away.

47:42.003 --> 47:43.871
Six fights.

47:45.306 --> 47:47.407
You're with me now.

47:47.409 --> 47:50.143
[Door closes]

47:50.146 --> 47:52.646
[Music plays]

47:54.414 --> 47:56.650
Fuck!
