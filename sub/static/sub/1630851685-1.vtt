00:49.920 --> 00:51.797
Open the gate.

00:57.240 --> 00:59.196
You guys wanna step up to the table?

01:10.960 --> 01:12.552
Open the gate, please.

03:15.680 --> 03:17.910
- Can I help you?
- A dog.

03:18.080 --> 03:19.718
Everything on it?

03:35.520 --> 03:39.149
Hey. Hey. Sixty-five cents.

04:45.760 --> 04:47.671
Mr. Frank, please.

04:50.960 --> 04:52.279
No.

04:54.040 --> 04:58.192
Well, my name's Dembo, A-20284.

05:00.680 --> 05:03.956
Dembo, A-20284. Okay?

05:04.120 --> 05:07.351
Just tell him that I'm here and I'll just...
I'll see him tomorrow morning.

05:07.520 --> 05:10.318
I got an appointment with him.
Nothing important.

05:10.480 --> 05:12.357
Yeah, okay. Thank you.

06:17.760 --> 06:18.795
- Hi, Max.
- Hi.

06:18.960 --> 06:20.393
Earl Frank.

06:20.560 --> 06:21.834
Come on in.

06:25.720 --> 06:26.914
Have a seat.

06:28.320 --> 06:31.153
- You're a little late.
- I had some trouble getting down here.

06:31.320 --> 06:33.788
- Want a coffee?
- Yeah, thanks.

06:34.400 --> 06:35.594
Black.

06:39.400 --> 06:42.790
So fill me in. How was the trip?

06:42.960 --> 06:46.077
On the bus down? It was a little long.

06:46.840 --> 06:50.071
- We made about 27 stops.
- Yeah, it's a real milk train.

06:50.240 --> 06:52.071
Go ahead. Put it down on the floor.

06:53.320 --> 06:54.992
So, what'd you do last night?

06:55.160 --> 06:57.037
Oh, walked around.

06:57.960 --> 07:00.554
- Meet anybody?
- No, nobody I know.

07:00.880 --> 07:03.030
Where'd you stay?
You didn't go to the halfway house.

07:03.200 --> 07:05.714
- I called. Didn't you get the message?
- You called here?

07:05.880 --> 07:08.553
Last night. I left a message
with your answering service.

07:08.720 --> 07:10.472
- I didn't get it.
- I left it.

07:10.640 --> 07:11.629
So where'd you sleep?

07:12.200 --> 07:13.349
In a motel.

07:13.520 --> 07:16.432
The conditions of your parole
were that you were to go to the house.

07:16.600 --> 07:18.192
That's a way to help you save money.

07:18.360 --> 07:20.396
Now, you agreed to that
before your release.

07:20.560 --> 07:21.595
Why didn't you go there?

07:22.000 --> 07:24.116
Because I just spent six years
in prison.

07:24.280 --> 07:27.317
I just wanted to look at the lights.
I wanted to feel free.

07:27.480 --> 07:29.072
I wanted to walk around...

07:29.240 --> 07:32.516
...and not have somebody tell me
that I gotta get in bed at 10:00.

07:33.040 --> 07:36.112
Max, I think you've got
a serious attitude problem.

07:36.480 --> 07:38.471
I don't have an attitude.

07:39.600 --> 07:43.036
Can you tell me what kind of attitude
you want me to have?

07:43.240 --> 07:46.118
Well, you don't decide whether or not
you go to a halfway house.

07:46.280 --> 07:48.999
I mean, you come to me,
we discuss it, then I decide.

07:49.800 --> 07:53.839
I'm trying to make you understand, I'm
aware of the realities of my situation...

07:54.000 --> 07:56.992
...that I'm not fated
to be a menace to society.

07:57.240 --> 07:59.549
I'm not gonna go out
and hit somebody over the head.

08:00.160 --> 08:03.596
My friend, I see that you're gonna
force me to deal with you.

08:05.760 --> 08:10.151
I see that you've got juvenile offenses
dating back to when you were 12.

08:10.320 --> 08:13.073
I see you've got auto theft,
you've got breaking and entering.

08:13.240 --> 08:15.117
All this leading up to
a burglary warrant.

08:15.280 --> 08:17.475
I just served six years
for that chickenshit rap.

08:17.640 --> 08:20.837
Chickenshit? You had a gun.

08:21.360 --> 08:23.794
Yeah, but I didn't use it
and I didn't hurt nobody.

08:24.800 --> 08:27.155
What was in your mind
when you put it in your pocket?

08:33.120 --> 08:34.951
I just took it along.

08:38.159 --> 08:40.150
I'm due in court.

08:40.760 --> 08:43.797
I'm aware that you have this power,
that you represent the state...

08:43.960 --> 08:46.758
...but, you know, I think that
you can give me a little leeway.

08:46.920 --> 08:48.194
You can be flexible.

08:48.360 --> 08:50.476
I was just hoping
to get some trust from you.

08:50.960 --> 08:52.916
You've gotta earn the trust.

08:53.120 --> 08:56.351
I have. I just wanna
be like everybody else.

08:56.520 --> 08:59.830
I just want a decent job.
I want a decent place to live.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.753
I want somebody to love me,
I want some clothes on my back...

09:02.960 --> 09:05.997
...have some self-respect.
- I gotta get going now.

09:06.200 --> 09:08.270
I tried to be straight with you, sir.

09:08.440 --> 09:11.910
I shouldn't have done that last night
without checking with you first.

09:12.080 --> 09:13.274
I'm sorry.

09:18.200 --> 09:19.553
I'm sorry.

09:24.720 --> 09:26.438
I'll make a deal with you, Max.

09:26.600 --> 09:29.672
If you find a place to sleep today
and a job by the end of the week...

09:29.840 --> 09:32.070
...you don't have to go
to a halfway house. Fair?

09:32.360 --> 09:34.351
That's fair. I appreciate that.

09:34.520 --> 09:37.876
When you find a place, you call
Miss De Veccio and give her the address.

09:38.040 --> 09:39.871
I'm gonna see you one day this week.

09:40.040 --> 09:41.189
That's okay.

09:41.360 --> 09:43.669
Here's the other hundred
you've got coming to you.

09:43.840 --> 09:46.115
I want you to sign for it.

09:47.800 --> 09:50.109
Now, do you understand
the conditions of your parole?

09:50.280 --> 09:52.635
- Yes, I do.
- You have to attend all meetings.

09:52.800 --> 09:55.997
You must heed the advice
and the counsel of your agent.

09:56.840 --> 09:59.673
- Now, do you know what that means?
- Yeah, I think I do.

09:59.840 --> 10:03.389
I gotta get along with you
or you're gonna throw me back in jail.

10:03.560 --> 10:04.879
That's it in a nutshell.

10:05.040 --> 10:08.077
- You're a tough man.
- No, I'm not, Max.

10:08.480 --> 10:10.118
All right, I gotta go now.

10:11.040 --> 10:12.996
- Good luck with it, now, huh?
- Okay.

10:13.160 --> 10:14.957
I'm gonna do my best.

10:15.760 --> 10:17.273
I know you're gonna do it.

11:05.920 --> 11:08.878
- How much?
- Eighteen dollars a week.

11:11.080 --> 11:12.433
Okay.

11:25.360 --> 11:27.430
- Here's your key.
- Clean sheets?

11:27.600 --> 11:30.637
No. Bathroom is over there.

11:58.360 --> 11:59.679
<i>Parole office. May I help you?</i>

11:59.840 --> 12:01.558
Could you leave a message
for Mr. Frank?

12:01.720 --> 12:06.635
<i>- Who 's calling?</i>
- My name is Max Dembo, A-20284.

12:06.800 --> 12:08.916
- What?
<i>- I got that.</i>

12:09.080 --> 12:11.150
- A-20284.
<i>- Thank you.</i>

12:11.320 --> 12:13.276
Could you tell him I'm
at the Garland Hotel?

12:13.440 --> 12:15.715
That's G-A-R-L-A-N-D.

12:15.920 --> 12:19.515
And you'd better give him
the phone number. It's 321-1321.

12:19.680 --> 12:22.990
<i>- I'll give him the message.</i>
- I'd appreciate it if he gets it today.

12:23.160 --> 12:26.630
<i>- I'll give him the message, sir.</i>
- Okay, thank you. Bye-bye.

12:59.840 --> 13:01.478
Time's up.

13:02.640 --> 13:04.392
Time's up.

13:06.720 --> 13:10.554
- Time's up. I'm sorry.
- I just wanted to finish that sentence.

13:10.720 --> 13:12.551
Bring those score sheets.

13:16.720 --> 13:18.597
You did great
on your intelligence test.

13:18.760 --> 13:21.194
Yeah, well, you know.
I could have told you that.

13:22.160 --> 13:23.149
One moment.

13:24.280 --> 13:26.191
Wilshire Agency.

13:26.440 --> 13:27.953
Yes, she is. Hold on.

13:28.120 --> 13:29.872
Pat, it's for you.

13:30.480 --> 13:32.914
- Did you put it on hold, honey?
- Yeah.

13:33.080 --> 13:34.115
Hello?

13:34.520 --> 13:37.114
Disconnected. I lost the call.

13:37.280 --> 13:41.239
You're supposed to push down "Hold"
before you use these other buttons.

13:41.400 --> 13:44.710
- There's "Hold," there's the buttons.
- Okay.

13:45.480 --> 13:47.232
I'm sorry.

13:49.920 --> 13:52.832
- Did you just get this job?
- Yeah. I've had it about a week.

13:53.320 --> 13:55.834
- Is she your boss?
- Yeah.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.912
Does she really like you
as much as she seems to?

14:01.080 --> 14:03.150
I guess. I don't know.

14:03.320 --> 14:06.198
You got a 61 on your typing test.

14:07.280 --> 14:09.919
- Is that bad?
- I'm afraid it's a little low.

14:10.080 --> 14:11.798
Well, I'm not used to the electric.

14:13.680 --> 14:15.113
What was your last
place of employment?

14:15.280 --> 14:17.430
Were you self-employed
or in the armed services?

14:17.760 --> 14:22.151
No. I didn't know whether to put down
"state penitentiary."

14:25.720 --> 14:27.597
I was a convict.

14:29.120 --> 14:31.509
And how long
did you hold that position?

14:33.600 --> 14:36.592
Approximately six years. No vacation.

14:38.840 --> 14:40.478
What'd you do?

14:42.440 --> 14:43.919
Burglary.

14:45.120 --> 14:48.795
You know, I know I fouled up
that typing test...

14:48.960 --> 14:51.952
...but I do know how
to work a manual...

14:52.120 --> 14:55.476
...and if you get any calls
for a manual typist...

14:55.640 --> 14:57.471
...I'd appreciate it, you know?

14:57.640 --> 14:59.119
Well, I'll see what I can do.

14:59.280 --> 15:00.918
All I wanna...

15:03.440 --> 15:05.670
All I wanna do is get a job.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.036
I need a fucking job.

15:11.520 --> 15:13.192
I believe you.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.877
Well, let me see.

15:19.040 --> 15:20.996
I'm sorry to be a problem.

15:21.160 --> 15:23.628
You know, like I can't drive a car
without permission.

15:23.800 --> 15:26.155
- Why not?
- Well, it's a parole restriction.

15:26.320 --> 15:30.916
I can't handle money, you know,
and it's like I'm limited...

15:31.080 --> 15:33.719
...in terms of what
they allow me to do.

15:34.680 --> 15:36.398
Is there anything at all?

15:36.560 --> 15:38.869
How about the National Can Company?

15:39.040 --> 15:42.157
- Think they'd let you work there?
- Yeah.

15:42.480 --> 15:46.837
- I think that'd be all right with them.
- It's not much. It's only scale.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.230
You wanna try? Okay.

15:49.400 --> 15:51.755
Let's see what we've got here.

15:52.160 --> 15:54.993
Well, go here and see what they say.

15:58.960 --> 16:02.748
Listen, if I get this job,
can I celebrate by taking you to dinner?

16:04.600 --> 16:06.272
You're not sure?

16:07.680 --> 16:09.796
Is that a half yes?

16:11.600 --> 16:13.192
I guess so.

16:14.120 --> 16:16.076
When you go there,
I hope you get the job.

16:16.240 --> 16:17.832
- Thanks for your time.
- Good luck.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.958
- Thank you.
- Let me know what happens.

16:21.240 --> 16:22.593
Okay.

17:34.040 --> 17:36.873
- <i>Hello? Who is it?</i>
- Who is this?

17:37.040 --> 17:38.314
<i>This is Henry Darin.</i>

17:38.480 --> 17:40.835
- Henry Darin? I've heard about you.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

17:41.000 --> 17:42.797
- Is your daddy there?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

17:42.960 --> 17:46.350
Well, you tell him that somebody
wants to give the big bear a bear hug.

17:46.520 --> 17:47.794
<i>- Who is it?</i>
- Just tell him...

17:47.960 --> 17:50.838
...somebody wants to give the big bear
a bear hug. He'll know.

17:51.000 --> 17:55.232
<i>Dad! Someone wants to give you</i>
<i>a big-bear big bear hug!</i>

17:58.480 --> 17:59.799
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Willy?

17:59.960 --> 18:01.518
<i>- Yeah?</i>
- It's Max.

18:01.680 --> 18:02.829
<i>Dembo?</i>

18:03.000 --> 18:04.752
- How you doing?
<i>- Max, thank... Goddamn.</i>

18:04.920 --> 18:06.273
- Is that your boy?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

18:06.440 --> 18:08.749
The last time you wrote,
he was learning how to walk.

18:08.920 --> 18:10.512
<i>Well, where the hell are you?</i>

18:10.680 --> 18:12.750
I got no wheels yet.
You wanna come get me?

18:12.920 --> 18:14.148
<i>Yes! Tell me where you are.</i>

18:14.320 --> 18:16.709
Well, why don't I meet you
on 7th and Alvarado?

18:16.880 --> 18:19.030
- Lf I'm not there, wait for me, all right?
<i>- Okay.</i>

18:19.200 --> 18:20.599
- You coming now?
<i>- I'm coming now.</i>

18:20.760 --> 18:23.149
- Okay. I'll see you.
<i>- Okay. Yeah.</i>

18:38.640 --> 18:42.758
- How you doing?
- Good. Get in the back, Bart. In the back!

18:43.560 --> 18:47.109
- How you doing? Good to see you.
- It's going well.

18:47.280 --> 18:49.999
Good. Rock 'n' roll!

18:54.760 --> 18:57.069
- How you doing?
- Doing good.

18:57.520 --> 18:59.795
- You working?
- I'm riveting.

18:59.960 --> 19:02.952
Kitchens and bathrooms
in portable homes.

19:04.760 --> 19:06.079
How'd you get the job?

19:06.440 --> 19:09.000
Well, when I came out,
the parole officer got it for me...

19:09.160 --> 19:13.073
...and when I got off parole, Selma said,
"It's good enough. Why not keep it?"

19:13.240 --> 19:15.708
You'll be a riveter
the rest of your life, man.

19:15.880 --> 19:17.996
Shit, no, man.
I'm working on my time.

19:18.160 --> 19:20.435
I'm getting my drums together.
I'm gonna play.

19:21.080 --> 19:22.479
Holy Jesus!

19:22.640 --> 19:25.791
- You the one I talked to on the phone?
- Shake hands with Max Dembo.

19:25.960 --> 19:27.632
- This is my son, Henry.
- How you doing?

19:27.800 --> 19:29.836
Tell him a knock-knock joke.
He's got tons.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.275
- Knock-knock.
- Who's there?

19:32.880 --> 19:35.110
- You.
- You who?

19:35.360 --> 19:36.554
Gotcha. I know that one.

19:52.800 --> 19:54.836
Hey, look what
I found downtown, Mama.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.319
Henry.

19:56.600 --> 19:59.512
- Come on, Bart!
- Get inside there.

19:59.680 --> 20:01.830
- Hello, Max.
- Hi, Selma.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.560
- You didn't bring any beer, did you?
- Was I supposed to?

20:04.720 --> 20:06.312
- I got it.
- Good.

20:06.480 --> 20:07.879
How about some spaghetti?

20:08.040 --> 20:11.350
- Get inside. Get in, come on.
- Oh, God. Jesus, come on inside.

20:11.600 --> 20:15.479
- Come on, come on. Get in.
- God dog, that smells good.

20:16.520 --> 20:19.751
Show Max your muscle.
Make it. Make it big.

20:19.920 --> 20:21.638
Pretty hard. Let me see the other one.

20:21.800 --> 20:23.836
Make two of them.
Two of them at once, here.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.672
You work out?

20:26.640 --> 20:28.790
Does he work out? Come here.

20:28.960 --> 20:32.077
- Show Max what we do on Saturdays.
- You teaching him to defend himself?

20:32.240 --> 20:34.196
You bet your ass. On our days off.

20:34.360 --> 20:36.078
- How could you teach him?
- Got one in.

20:36.240 --> 20:38.071
Got one in there. Come on.

20:42.200 --> 20:44.077
- Okay, okay.
- He's gonna whip your ass.

20:44.240 --> 20:45.593
Where's them cigars?

20:45.760 --> 20:47.876
Hey. I told...

20:50.880 --> 20:51.915
So he's...

20:52.080 --> 20:54.833
Don't be hitting me
when I'm not looking at you.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.230
Oh, he's just playing.

21:01.480 --> 21:03.232
You defend yourself pretty good there.

21:03.400 --> 21:06.676
- You been in many fights?
- Yeah, 10.

21:06.840 --> 21:10.799
- Ten? Not bad. How many you won?
- Eighteen.

21:10.960 --> 21:14.111
Really? That's not a bad record.

21:17.320 --> 21:19.436
Eighteen out of 10.

21:20.720 --> 21:23.359
Hey, how you feel?
You wanna go out and hit the tubs?

21:23.520 --> 21:24.555
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

21:24.720 --> 21:27.598
I think he'd better go in
and clean up his room now.

21:28.080 --> 21:31.436
Selma, let me have about 10 minutes
with him, because I wanna make it...

21:31.600 --> 21:33.352
- I didn't mean to get mad.
- I know.

21:33.520 --> 21:36.432
- He's gotta get to bed early, okay?
- Just let... We...

21:36.720 --> 21:38.790
Let him go in
and clean up his room, okay?

21:38.960 --> 21:41.110
He's gotta get up early
tomorrow morning.

21:43.360 --> 21:45.715
- Okay?
- Okay.

21:49.520 --> 21:51.636
Come here. I get a kiss.

21:52.280 --> 21:55.750
- I get one too. Good night.
- Give Max a kiss. That's it.

21:56.880 --> 21:58.871
Everybody gets a kiss.

21:59.040 --> 22:01.110
- Hey, I'm sorry.
- Okay.

22:01.280 --> 22:02.474
I didn't mean to get mad.

22:02.640 --> 22:03.789
Okay?

22:05.200 --> 22:07.430
Didn't mean to get mad at you.

22:08.880 --> 22:12.236
See you later. Excuse me.

22:12.760 --> 22:15.320
I'll be getting that board together.

22:21.560 --> 22:23.152
You got any more coffee?

22:32.640 --> 22:35.438
That Henry is a nice boy.

22:35.600 --> 22:37.192
Yes, he is.

22:40.680 --> 22:42.591
Come here, man. Get up here.

22:42.760 --> 22:43.909
Come on. Get up here.

22:44.080 --> 22:46.469
Come on. Get up here.

22:46.720 --> 22:48.915
Sit up here. Smart dog.

22:49.080 --> 22:50.513
Come here.

22:51.040 --> 22:53.838
Want something to eat?
Okay if I give him some ice cream?

22:54.000 --> 22:55.718
Sure. He'll eat anything,

22:55.880 --> 22:58.838
Next time I'm down here,
I'm gonna bring him a steak bone.

22:59.000 --> 23:02.310
In fact, as soon as Willy turns his back,
I'm gonna steal this dog.

23:02.480 --> 23:04.948
You know, Max,
I don't wanna hurt your feelings...

23:05.120 --> 23:07.714
...but your being around here
is kind of bad timing for us.

23:07.880 --> 23:09.359
Why is that?

23:10.120 --> 23:13.715
Well, Willy's been doing real good,
you know.

23:13.880 --> 23:17.873
He's been doing real fine.
He's been working hard lately.

23:18.480 --> 23:22.155
And I know you're good friends
and he really loves you...

23:23.600 --> 23:26.797
...but I just don't think it's good
that he see you right now.

23:27.640 --> 23:28.868
You know what I mean?

23:29.040 --> 23:31.759
You trying to tell me you don't
want me to come here no more?

23:34.600 --> 23:36.875
I don't mean to be unkind.

23:38.880 --> 23:42.839
I just think it's better that he doesn't
get around other influences and stuff.

24:01.120 --> 24:03.588
You're on parole now, Max.

24:03.880 --> 24:07.111
Well, you really shouldn't even
be seen with Willy, right?

24:09.120 --> 24:10.678
I think I get the message.

24:12.920 --> 24:14.956
You make me feel bad.

24:15.280 --> 24:18.955
Why? You're just doing
what you have to do, Selma.

24:19.400 --> 24:20.992
It's no problem.

24:22.320 --> 24:23.753
It's cool.

24:38.600 --> 24:40.113
This is it.

24:44.760 --> 24:46.955
- Here. Let me get it.
- I'll get the front.

24:47.120 --> 24:48.792
- You sure?
- Yeah.

24:48.960 --> 24:52.191
- All right. It's three flights up.
- I gotta piss, so you'd better run.

24:52.360 --> 24:53.759
All right.

25:02.680 --> 25:05.990
Remember that place called The Hague?
Right across from the Cocoanut Grove.

25:06.160 --> 25:08.628
- Where do you want it?
- Put it underneath the bed there.

25:08.800 --> 25:12.190
Last time I was there, Hampton Hawes
and Chet Baker were playing there.

25:12.360 --> 25:14.191
- Is it still open?
- I don't know.

25:14.360 --> 25:18.638
- Three flights of stairs killed me.
- Go back in the joint, you'll get in shape.

25:18.800 --> 25:20.836
- Hold it up.
- I got it.

25:21.520 --> 25:24.990
- You sure it don't have termites?
- It's okay.

25:25.160 --> 25:28.755
How does it feel?
That's the main thing.

25:28.920 --> 25:30.194
It's good, isn't it?

25:30.360 --> 25:32.191
I know where we could go.

25:32.360 --> 25:35.193
- The Autoway Club.
- The what?

25:35.360 --> 25:37.920
The Autoway Club. Remember that?
We used to go there?

25:38.080 --> 25:40.196
- We could go.
- Do a little fucking around, maybe.

25:40.360 --> 25:42.749
Yeah. Maybe we could
go to Hermosa Beach too.

25:42.920 --> 25:44.478
Oh, yeah.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.275
- Howard Rumsey...
- Yeah.

25:47.440 --> 25:49.396
...and his Lighthouse All-Stars.

25:49.560 --> 25:53.348
All right, let's go there. Maybe there'll be
some nice little girls there I can...

25:59.240 --> 26:01.276
You can get me three years for that.

26:04.360 --> 26:05.713
Sorry.

26:14.800 --> 26:16.597
I got excited, that's all.

26:16.760 --> 26:18.955
Does Selma know you're using?

26:19.120 --> 26:21.475
Well, she's always suspicious.

27:25.120 --> 27:27.588
The machine broke down,
so I gotta stay.

27:28.440 --> 27:32.592
What do you want me to tell you?
I'll probably be about two or three hours.

27:32.760 --> 27:34.398
Well, I'm glad.

27:34.560 --> 27:36.357
All right. Bye.

27:57.840 --> 28:01.389
<i>- Hello. Jenny Mercer speaking.</i>
- Hi. How you doing? This is Max Dembo.

28:01.560 --> 28:04.028
Thank you for making me
a bona fide member of society.

28:04.200 --> 28:06.509
<i>Oh, you got the job? That's great.</i>

28:06.680 --> 28:08.910
- Why don't you have dinner with me?
<i>- When?</i>

28:09.080 --> 28:12.595
I could be there in an hour and a half.
I wanna go shower and change.

28:12.760 --> 28:14.910
<i>Actually, I was planning on</i>
<i>staying home tonight.</i>

28:15.080 --> 28:18.152
It's just that it's the first chance I have
to celebrate something.

28:18.320 --> 28:19.992
You know? I want to...

28:20.160 --> 28:23.232
You know, I wanna have a steak.
I thought you could keep me company.

28:23.400 --> 28:27.234
- I don't even know what to order.
<i>- Okay.</i>

28:27.400 --> 28:28.753
- Is that okay?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

28:28.920 --> 28:33.596
All right, can I be at your office,
let's say about 5:30?

28:33.760 --> 28:34.909
<i>- See you then.</i>
- All right.

28:35.080 --> 28:36.957
- <i>Bye.</i>
- Bye-bye.

28:40.800 --> 28:44.793
All I'm saying is, out here, the rules
aren't defined. On the inside, they are.

28:44.960 --> 28:48.430
If you don't pay back your debts, if you
owe a couple packs of cigarettes...

28:48.600 --> 28:52.434
...if you take somebody's glove or
lie to someone, then you get killed.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.560
You know that's the rules,
so you live by them.

28:55.920 --> 28:59.595
You can get killed with a sharp edge...

28:59.760 --> 29:01.478
...the end of this spoon.

29:01.640 --> 29:03.119
That's a lethal weapon.

29:03.280 --> 29:04.998
Even the end of a toothbrush.

29:05.160 --> 29:09.472
You can get hit in the yard
or you can get it in the shower.

29:09.840 --> 29:14.834
You're in your cell sleeping, someone can
go by with a can of gas and throw it in.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.230
Somebody else throws in a match
and you're torched.

29:17.400 --> 29:20.551
You know that's the reality
and you're living with it 24 hours a day.

29:21.440 --> 29:22.589
That's frightening.

29:22.760 --> 29:25.718
A lot of guys think this is more
frightening, being on the outside.

29:25.880 --> 29:28.314
Why? I don't understand.

29:29.160 --> 29:32.914
Because out here, it's what you
got in your pocket that matters...

29:33.080 --> 29:35.992
...and on the inside,
it's only what you are.

29:36.680 --> 29:38.193
You're glad to be out, aren't you?

29:42.600 --> 29:48.630
It's like a dream.
It's every con's fantasy to be out here.

29:49.320 --> 29:55.316
I can't tell you the number of times
I thought about a scene just like this...

29:57.840 --> 30:01.958
...but I never thought I'd be sitting here
with a knot in my stomach.

30:05.800 --> 30:07.870
Tell me more about that guy
you were going with.

30:08.040 --> 30:09.632
How long were you with him?

30:10.280 --> 30:13.113
I lived with him for about two years.

30:13.280 --> 30:15.236
Who broke it off?

30:15.400 --> 30:17.152
I did.

30:17.840 --> 30:20.434
Thank you very much.
Come on back again.

30:22.600 --> 30:26.229
Wanna know something?
I'm glad you asked me out.

30:31.920 --> 30:34.195
Don't you have enough money?

30:34.960 --> 30:37.428
I think I got enough for the tax.

30:38.080 --> 30:39.229
Here, I've got some.

30:39.400 --> 30:42.437
Wait a minute.
I wanted this to be my treat.

30:44.080 --> 30:46.275
Why don't we just walk out?

30:46.720 --> 30:49.154
You don't wanna do that, do you?

30:49.560 --> 30:53.269
I'll make a deal. If you'll go out with me
tomorrow night, I'll let you help me.

30:54.880 --> 30:57.030
Okay, you've got a deal.

30:57.960 --> 31:01.350
All right, be discreet
and slip it under the table.

32:15.720 --> 32:16.869
Hi, how you doing?

32:18.120 --> 32:19.269
Okay.

32:19.440 --> 32:22.273
I was in the neighborhood,
so I had your manager let me in.

32:22.440 --> 32:25.557
- Mind if I come in?
- Sure. Come on, it's your home.

32:25.720 --> 32:27.870
I mean, this is just routine, you know.

32:28.040 --> 32:30.918
It's a nice room.
You've got cross-ventilation. Nice view.

32:31.080 --> 32:33.992
- Yeah, it's nice.
- What they charge you for?

32:34.160 --> 32:36.594
It's $ 17 a week.

32:36.760 --> 32:39.513
- That's better than $ 17 in a motel.
- Yeah.

32:39.680 --> 32:40.999
- You're right.
- I know.

32:41.160 --> 32:44.072
Do you mind if I change?
I gotta be somewhere in a half-hour.

32:44.240 --> 32:47.152
No, go right ahead.
Don't let me hold you up. Go ahead.

32:48.240 --> 32:49.798
- What do you got, a date?
- Yeah.

32:49.960 --> 32:51.552
Is she white?

32:51.720 --> 32:53.836
I'm just joking.

32:55.720 --> 32:57.199
So...

32:57.360 --> 32:58.554
...who is she?

32:58.720 --> 33:01.234
I met her at the employment agency.
She works there.

33:01.400 --> 33:05.279
In fact, she sent me for a job
and I went over there and I got it.

33:05.440 --> 33:08.238
Great. Great. What kind of work is it?

33:08.400 --> 33:10.152
Well, it's just a can company,
you know.

33:10.320 --> 33:11.878
- Regular wage?
- Yeah.

33:12.040 --> 33:15.271
Well, that's a start.
Did you tell them you were on parole?

33:15.440 --> 33:16.793
No. Is that a problem?

33:16.960 --> 33:18.916
Oh, no worry.
I can take care of that.

33:19.080 --> 33:21.196
You've got a room,
you've got a job, the whole...

33:21.360 --> 33:24.511
You gave me a week, so yeah.
It's over in Verona.

33:26.720 --> 33:28.312
What's this?

33:29.600 --> 33:31.670
- Just matches.
- I know that.

33:31.840 --> 33:33.432
Take off your shirt.
Let's see your arms.

33:33.600 --> 33:35.875
- They're not mine.
- Max, take off your shirt.

33:45.000 --> 33:46.319
What's this?

33:46.480 --> 33:50.155
That's just a scratch I got
on the job today. It's not tracks.

33:50.600 --> 33:52.636
- Let me see this one.
- You won't find nothing.

33:52.800 --> 33:54.631
Just let me do my work.

33:56.960 --> 34:00.475
- Where'd you get all those scars?
- It's just burns.

34:00.640 --> 34:02.949
- When you were a kid?
- Yeah, it was an accident.

34:03.120 --> 34:04.599
Does it hurt?

34:04.760 --> 34:06.716
Let me see the other one.

34:07.120 --> 34:10.795
Did you hear about the Polack
who got third-degree burns on his face?

34:11.560 --> 34:13.676
He was dunking for french fries.

34:13.840 --> 34:15.558
Been drinking some beer, huh?

34:15.719 --> 34:17.391
Yeah. Just a couple cans, though.

34:17.560 --> 34:19.755
- What are you doing?
- Come on, Max.

34:19.920 --> 34:22.070
Come on, Max. Come on, now.
Take it easy.

34:22.239 --> 34:24.356
Why'd you do that?
You didn't have to chain me.

34:24.520 --> 34:26.511
- It's procedure.
- I told you, I'm clean.

34:26.679 --> 34:27.908
Then you got nothing
to worry about.

34:28.080 --> 34:30.435
Just come over here and check me
if you got a doubt.

34:30.719 --> 34:32.755
- Lf you're clean...
- What do you mean, "if"?

34:32.920 --> 34:35.228
You didn't check me properly.
Did you check my eyes?

34:35.400 --> 34:37.391
If you're clean,
you got nothing to worry about.

34:37.560 --> 34:40.393
I gotta make a phone call,
then we'll take you down and test you.

34:40.560 --> 34:44.518
- I could save you a lot of trouble.
- It's no trouble. It's what I get paid for.

34:52.520 --> 34:54.476
We're just playing a game.

35:05.920 --> 35:07.876
All right. Come on, follow me.

35:10.760 --> 35:12.557
Come on. Keep it up.

35:21.160 --> 35:22.798
All right, move right in here.

35:22.960 --> 35:27.476
- Gentlemen, follow the red line.
- Take your hat off.

35:30.600 --> 35:33.114
- Right in the corner, facing me.
- Take your hat off.

35:35.560 --> 35:39.030
Start with you, right over in this corner.
Facing me, gentlemen.

35:39.200 --> 35:41.350
Everybody facing me.

35:42.160 --> 35:45.516
In case you don't know where you are,
this is the Los Angeles County Jail.

35:45.680 --> 35:49.912
Welcome, and empty your pockets
on the floor. Everything out.

35:50.080 --> 35:53.914
Cigarettes, money, matches,
everything. On the floor.

35:54.680 --> 35:58.036
Turn your pockets inside out
after you get everything out.

36:03.080 --> 36:06.516
Okay, gentlemen, I want you to run
your fingers through your hair.

36:07.360 --> 36:09.430
Shake it out good.

36:09.600 --> 36:11.158
Shake it out good.

36:13.160 --> 36:14.798
- Is that a wig?
- Yeah, it's a wig.

36:14.960 --> 36:17.190
Take it off. Put it on the floor.

36:18.120 --> 36:20.156
Run your hands through your hair.

36:24.840 --> 36:28.594
Okay, gentlemen, put your hands
out in front of you, palms up.

36:30.800 --> 36:32.916
Okay, turn over.

36:33.880 --> 36:37.475
Okay, gentlemen, turn around
and grab a piece of the wall.

36:37.640 --> 36:39.198
Step back. Spread your feet.

36:49.720 --> 36:53.030
As soon as you take your clothes off,
I want you to sit on a bench.

36:53.720 --> 36:54.914
Okay, move on.

36:55.080 --> 36:57.275
Don't be afraid to use some soap.

36:58.280 --> 37:01.192
All right, gentlemen,
you in the shower, let's move it out.

37:01.360 --> 37:04.830
We don't have all day.
That water's not free.

37:07.280 --> 37:09.157
Take your showers and get out.

37:09.320 --> 37:13.791
As soon as you step out of your shower,
grab a towel and step over on the side.

37:13.960 --> 37:16.520
Dry yourself off thoroughly.

37:17.760 --> 37:19.591
Let's go, gentlemen.

37:21.320 --> 37:22.878
Turn around.

37:24.480 --> 37:27.552
- Go. Let's go, arms up.
- Lf you were on a bench, get a shower.

37:27.720 --> 37:30.109
- Small, medium or large?
- Medium.

37:30.280 --> 37:34.512
- Head down. Turn around. Go.
- Let's go, gentlemen.

37:34.680 --> 37:38.150
Get out of the shower and dry off.
We don't have enough time.

37:38.320 --> 37:40.788
- Let's go. Move it out.
- Good hands, Pop.

37:53.280 --> 37:55.396
That one's mine, partner.

38:15.160 --> 38:17.833
Stand clear!

39:08.840 --> 39:11.434
Dembo! Visit!

39:43.280 --> 39:45.316
- Hi, remember me?
- Yeah. How you doing?

39:45.480 --> 39:48.677
- Pretty good. How are you?
- I'm fine.

39:49.080 --> 39:53.312
I called and your landlady told me
you were arrested. What happened?

39:54.760 --> 39:56.273
I don't know.

39:57.160 --> 39:58.718
Doesn't matter.

39:59.920 --> 40:02.434
I got worried. I was waiting and...

40:03.520 --> 40:05.078
When are you getting out?

40:09.800 --> 40:12.155
I don't know.
It's a little hard to say.

40:15.040 --> 40:17.600
You don't mind my coming here, do you?

40:21.120 --> 40:25.113
I called earlier and they said
the visiting room closes at 3.

40:25.280 --> 40:27.555
I got lost on the way.

40:31.120 --> 40:33.270
Is there anything I can do?

40:36.360 --> 40:39.238
- No, it's all right.
- What?

40:41.000 --> 40:44.709
Oh, God, there's no more time.
Wait a second.

40:50.480 --> 40:51.913
- I gotta go.
- Wait. Wait.

40:53.800 --> 40:55.552
Call me when you get out.

40:55.720 --> 40:58.518
Call me. It's my home phone.

41:00.040 --> 41:01.712
Okay?

41:47.240 --> 41:51.233
This terrific-looking blond goes into this
dentist's office and she's really scared.

41:51.400 --> 41:55.109
She climbs up into the chair as the
dentist prepares his utensils and things.

41:55.280 --> 41:58.317
And just as he turns around
and is about to look into her mouth...

41:58.480 --> 42:01.472
...she blurts out,
"Oh, doctor, I'm so afraid of dentists...

42:01.640 --> 42:04.632
...I think I'd rather have a baby
than have a tooth drilled."

42:04.800 --> 42:07.872
"Well, miss," the doctor says,
"you'd better make up your mind...

42:08.040 --> 42:10.429
...before I adjust the chair."

42:15.640 --> 42:17.835
So how you doing?

42:19.480 --> 42:22.153
How do you think I'm doing,
slammed down?

42:23.440 --> 42:24.953
What?

42:25.560 --> 42:27.232
I'm okay.

42:27.400 --> 42:31.075
Listen, your urine tested clean.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.958
I'm sorry you got stuck here,
but I've had my hands full this week.

42:35.120 --> 42:38.476
- This is the first time I could reach you.
- Did the phones break down?

42:39.760 --> 42:42.558
Don't get sarcastic with me, Dembo.

42:43.080 --> 42:46.436
I'm having you released from here.
I'll take you to a halfway house myself.

42:46.600 --> 42:49.319
- When is that? Now?
- Right now.

42:49.480 --> 42:51.835
I think that's more than generous.

42:54.600 --> 42:55.749
You're the boss.

42:55.920 --> 42:58.753
Right. You're smart enough
to recognize a break when you get one.

42:58.920 --> 43:01.309
Now, you were clean,
but somebody fixed in your room.

43:01.480 --> 43:04.313
That's a violation of your parole
and it's enough to get you...

43:04.480 --> 43:06.436
...a minimum of two to three years.

43:06.600 --> 43:08.158
Am I right?

43:09.680 --> 43:12.035
- So we'll start from scratch.
- Sure.

43:12.200 --> 43:14.953
We'll get you cleaned up
and we'll get you out of here.

43:15.720 --> 43:18.280
- Okay.
- All right.

43:19.400 --> 43:22.392
Sometimes this job
is getting to be too much.

43:22.560 --> 43:24.596
You wouldn't believe the week
I had last week.

43:24.760 --> 43:27.877
I missed my girl's school play.
My wife was so pissed off at me...

43:28.040 --> 43:29.712
...I thought she was gonna
divorce me.

43:29.880 --> 43:33.270
On top of that, I got a call that one
of my guys was holed up in his house.

43:33.440 --> 43:36.512
Threatening his wife with a shotgun.
Guess how I handled that one.

43:36.680 --> 43:37.954
I used my head.

43:38.480 --> 43:40.391
I called his father in Detroit...

43:40.560 --> 43:44.030
...then I got them talking on the phone.
They must have talked for three hours.

43:44.200 --> 43:47.397
All this is person-to-person.
It's costing the state.

43:49.640 --> 43:54.111
<i>- Top of the seventh inning, Dodgers</i>
<i>leading 10-2. Scored 10 each game.</i>

43:54.280 --> 43:57.875
Damn it. You know, I had 10 bucks
on that game.

43:59.000 --> 44:00.433
Everything you got check out?

44:01.240 --> 44:03.356
- Yeah.
- Good.

44:03.520 --> 44:05.750
Cooking spoon's not there, is it?

44:06.880 --> 44:10.555
Come on. Just between you and me,
this doesn't go any further...

44:10.720 --> 44:12.517
...who was it shot up in your room?

44:14.760 --> 44:16.955
I just can't tell you that.

44:17.320 --> 44:20.915
I'm taking you to a halfway house.
I'm not taking you back to the joint.

44:21.080 --> 44:23.150
You asked for my trust.
I'm giving it to you.

44:23.320 --> 44:26.517
- How about giving a little back in return?
- I can't tell you that.

44:26.680 --> 44:30.593
Bullshit. If you can't trust me, what
the hell, I'm just wasting gas driving.

44:30.760 --> 44:34.196
- I don't want you to waste your gas.
- Then tell me who it was.

44:41.400 --> 44:42.799
Christ, you're gonna kill us!

44:45.200 --> 44:46.997
Put your hands down.

44:53.840 --> 44:56.149
Put them down. Go on.

45:04.400 --> 45:07.039
Don't fuck with me, sucker.
You busted me for nothing!

45:07.200 --> 45:09.555
You big, bald fucker!

45:24.640 --> 45:27.871
You're finished.
You made your choice.

45:39.200 --> 45:40.792
Max!

45:51.560 --> 45:56.714
- Damn you sons of bitches!
- Hey, fatso, where's your pants?

46:23.760 --> 46:26.593
- Hey, how you doing, man?
- Hey, my friend.

46:26.760 --> 46:28.955
- How you been?
- Haven't seen you in a while.

46:29.120 --> 46:30.633
I know, I got hung up for a while.

46:30.800 --> 46:33.109
- What you got going?
- I need your car.

46:33.280 --> 46:34.633
- The keys are in it.
- All right.

46:34.800 --> 46:37.872
- Hey, take me with you.
- I can't. I gotta see some people.

46:38.040 --> 46:39.439
Be back in a couple hours.

46:39.600 --> 46:42.239
- Next time, I wanna go with you.
- All right, you got it.

46:42.400 --> 46:44.197
- I'm not shitting you.
- I hear you.

46:44.880 --> 46:47.838
- Lf I go with you, I can drive. I can get...
- You got it.

46:48.000 --> 46:50.116
Hey, my radio.

46:50.280 --> 46:51.838
I'll be back, couple hours.

46:52.000 --> 46:53.149
Where's he going?

46:53.320 --> 46:56.357
He's going to the store.
He'll be back in a minute.

47:41.440 --> 47:44.876
- How are you? What's to it, Manny?
- How you doing, man?

47:45.040 --> 47:47.270
- How are you?
- I'm all right.

47:47.440 --> 47:49.237
I wanna talk.

47:49.840 --> 47:52.274
- Yeah.
- I mean right now, okay?

47:54.480 --> 47:57.711
- Lf anybody asks for me, I'm not here.
- All right.

48:03.760 --> 48:06.718
- What do you wanna talk about?
- I just need your help.

48:07.080 --> 48:09.799
- What do you want, money?
- I want a pistol.

48:11.040 --> 48:12.712
No, I don't do that, Max.

48:12.880 --> 48:16.509
- You don't keep a piece in your office?
- I don't play around with guns.

48:17.960 --> 48:20.997
You owe me one, Manny.
You owe me one.

48:25.360 --> 48:27.157
Come on.

48:30.840 --> 48:32.398
Shut the door.

48:32.560 --> 48:35.632
- I got something we took off a drunk.
- Just give me what you have.

48:35.800 --> 48:38.598
I just gotta get my hands
on some heavy stuff, you know?

48:38.760 --> 48:42.196
I need a Thompson,
you know, a Magnum.

48:43.000 --> 48:45.036
Maybe a shotgun.
Can you raise that for me?

48:45.200 --> 48:47.077
- Takes a lot of cash, Max.
- What is this?

48:47.240 --> 48:49.470
It's a piece of shit.
We took it off a drunk.

48:49.640 --> 48:52.200
- Does it work?
- I don't know. I don't play with those.

48:52.360 --> 48:55.397
- Makes my dick hard.
- It's yours.

48:56.360 --> 48:58.430
You put up the money,
I'll take care of you.

48:58.600 --> 49:01.910
- I ain't got that kind of cash.
- You're doing a lot of business out there.

49:02.080 --> 49:03.559
How much time do you need?

49:03.720 --> 49:07.076
- Give me a couple of days.
- You got it.

49:07.720 --> 49:11.918
I read you, Manny. Try for it tonight.
I'll call your house in the morning.

49:14.480 --> 49:17.517
Give me one full day. Go that way.
Go the side way.

49:17.680 --> 49:19.511
One full day.

50:31.760 --> 50:33.512
Take it easy and you won't get hurt.

50:33.680 --> 50:35.352
Give me the money.

50:35.800 --> 50:37.518
Open the register.

50:40.720 --> 50:42.358
Open the register.

50:42.520 --> 50:43.714
Does he speak English?

50:43.880 --> 50:45.598
Better tell him to open the register.

50:51.440 --> 50:54.273
Open the fucking register
or I'll blow your fucking head off.

50:54.440 --> 50:57.000
- Open it. You feel that? You feel that?
- Yeah.

50:57.160 --> 50:58.434
Open it.

51:00.360 --> 51:02.555
Get down. Get down.

51:05.080 --> 51:06.479
Hold it.

51:15.480 --> 51:16.993
Hold it.

51:17.760 --> 51:19.239
Don't move.

51:24.160 --> 51:25.912
Don't come out.

52:39.400 --> 52:40.753
What are you thinking about?

52:42.520 --> 52:45.159
You know you're
breaking the law right now?

52:45.320 --> 52:47.038
What do you mean?

52:47.440 --> 52:51.069
I mean, a cop could knock
on that door, put you in jail.

52:54.360 --> 52:56.510
Why would he do that?

52:57.000 --> 52:58.991
You're harboring a fugitive.

52:59.160 --> 53:02.709
I jumped my parole yesterday.
I'm on the run.

53:04.480 --> 53:06.710
I'll take my chances.

53:09.680 --> 53:11.591
No, I don't want any.

53:16.320 --> 53:18.709
I'd like to take you out tonight...

53:18.880 --> 53:21.917
...but I got some business to do
with some people...

53:22.080 --> 53:25.072
...so why don't you just let me
borrow your car for a while?

53:27.160 --> 53:28.832
Okay.

53:33.640 --> 53:35.198
Promise not to steal it?

53:40.800 --> 53:43.155
Gotta go to work in the morning.

54:12.040 --> 54:13.598
- Damn, you scared me.
- Hey, Max.

54:13.760 --> 54:14.909
Mickey. How you been?

54:15.080 --> 54:16.672
- All right. When did you raise?
- A couple days ago.

54:16.840 --> 54:20.230
- Where'd you get those threads?
- Bought them. Let's go sit down, friend.

54:20.400 --> 54:21.992
You're looking good.

54:22.160 --> 54:23.593
- Slick.
- Yeah.

54:23.760 --> 54:25.159
- It's good to see you.
- You too.

54:25.320 --> 54:26.958
Why don't you let us
have that seat...

54:27.120 --> 54:29.429
...so me and my friend
can talk some business?

54:29.960 --> 54:32.838
- So how have you been?
- How long have you been around?

54:33.000 --> 54:34.991
I don't know. A couple years.

54:35.200 --> 54:36.952
- Want a drink?
- Yeah.

54:37.120 --> 54:41.238
- Tommy.
- Double Jack Daniel's with a 7 back.

54:41.400 --> 54:44.517
- What do you want?
- I'll have one of these things right here.

54:45.040 --> 54:46.678
How you been?

54:48.640 --> 54:50.756
Ready to make a move.

54:51.080 --> 54:52.798
You got something
you wanna run by me?

54:52.960 --> 54:55.872
I got a sweet poker game in the Valley
you might be interested in.

54:56.040 --> 54:58.918
- Sounds good. What's it good for?
- Fifteen or 20 big ones.

54:59.080 --> 55:00.911
That much? Any guns?

55:01.080 --> 55:03.435
No, just some fat-ass old men, man.

55:03.600 --> 55:07.354
They got pacemakers that'll short-circuit
when you charge through the door.

55:09.040 --> 55:10.917
All right, I'm interested.

55:11.080 --> 55:12.513
Can you help me with a partner?

55:12.920 --> 55:15.229
What about Kelly Mason?
He comes here all the time.

55:15.400 --> 55:17.152
He'd jump at the chance
to work with you.

55:17.320 --> 55:18.833
Who's that kid that just got up?

55:19.000 --> 55:22.117
That's Augie Morales' brother.

55:22.280 --> 55:23.918
- Is that Augie's kid brother?
- Yeah.

55:24.080 --> 55:27.152
- Get him over here.
- Hey, Chungie. Come here.

55:28.520 --> 55:30.317
- How you doing?
- Nice to see you again.

55:30.480 --> 55:33.472
This is Max Dembo, man.
He's a good friend of Augie's.

55:33.640 --> 55:35.392
- Hi.
- You don't remember me, do you?

55:35.560 --> 55:38.632
- You're a friend of my brother's, right?
- How's he doing?

55:38.800 --> 55:41.872
He's not doing very well right now.
He's doing 20 years in Arizona...

55:42.040 --> 55:44.759
...and has a lot of problems
in California too.

55:44.920 --> 55:48.117
- Can you vouch for him?
- He's as good as Augie was at that age.

55:48.280 --> 55:49.872
Can I get ahold of him through you?

55:50.040 --> 55:52.508
I got his phone number,
or you can catch him in here.

55:52.680 --> 55:55.240
I got something for you, maybe.
We'll talk later, okay?

55:55.400 --> 55:57.755
- Just give me a call.
- Give my love to your brother.

55:57.920 --> 56:01.151
- I will. Thanks very much. See you later.
- All right, take care.

56:01.320 --> 56:03.550
- Does he take shit?
- No, he's too smart for that.

56:03.720 --> 56:05.039
He's a good thief for his age.

56:05.960 --> 56:07.109
Know what I'd like to do?

56:07.280 --> 56:10.317
Run me by that motel.
We'll check it out, then go cut it up.

56:11.520 --> 56:14.398
I'll drive you out there,
but I'm not gonna rob it for you.

56:14.560 --> 56:18.075
You've got to do that yourself,
you know. I got stomach trouble.

56:18.240 --> 56:20.037
No guts.

56:50.480 --> 56:52.152
Did I scare you?

56:53.320 --> 56:54.719
Yeah, a little bit.

57:15.240 --> 57:17.435
You gotta go to work pretty soon.

57:24.160 --> 57:26.071
What time is it?

59:09.360 --> 59:11.510
Wanna take a shower with me?

59:14.960 --> 59:16.552
Can I use your phone?

59:16.720 --> 59:18.472
Yeah, go ahead.

59:29.600 --> 59:31.750
Is Jerry Schue there?

59:32.120 --> 59:35.032
- Looks like you're fixed up pretty good.
- It's going all right.

59:35.200 --> 59:37.634
After you fell,
I pulled a few jobs and met Carol.

59:37.800 --> 59:38.949
She straightened me out...

59:39.120 --> 59:42.749
...so I set myself up in the
painting/contracting business. Sit here.

59:43.200 --> 59:44.997
We bought the house.

59:45.160 --> 59:49.950
I got that boat. Put the pool in last year.
The only thing I need's a new car.

59:50.960 --> 59:53.952
The one out front belonged to Carol's ex.
It's about had it.
