It's my birthday.

00:45.219 --> 00:48.091
It's my b-day.
Yo, my b-day.

00:48.135 --> 00:51.225
- It's a me day.
- I said....

00:52.226 --> 00:54.097
Yeah!

00:54.141 --> 00:55.707
Yeah get away from me.
I'm trying to hang these decorations.

00:55.751 --> 00:57.057
Yeah, you hang them.

00:57.100 --> 00:59.885
You hang them for me
real good. Whoo!

00:59.929 --> 01:02.758
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
It's my day, son.

01:02.801 --> 01:05.543
- It's my day.
- Chill!

01:05.587 --> 01:07.458
- Sheesh!
- Oh, I can't.

01:07.502 --> 01:10.070
'Cause it's my b-b-b-birthday.

01:10.113 --> 01:11.723
Birthday!

01:11.767 --> 01:13.377
Give me that cake.
Give me that cake.

01:13.421 --> 01:15.205
Give me that, that,
that, that cake.

01:15.249 --> 01:18.121
Uh-huh-huh!
That cake looks good, Mama.

01:18.165 --> 01:20.254
It's organic, right?
No glutens in there, right?

01:20.297 --> 01:21.559
It's all vegan, right?

01:21.603 --> 01:23.735
I don't know. It's cake.
Who cares?

01:23.779 --> 01:25.563
I cares, Mama.

01:25.607 --> 01:28.305
And on my birthdays, you got
to cares about my cares!

01:28.349 --> 01:30.568
Whoo-hoo!
Now where's my pinata at?

01:30.612 --> 01:33.615
The cardboard animal for the
beating is right the here.

01:33.658 --> 01:35.399
Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm.
That's what I thought.

01:35.443 --> 01:38.098
I can't wait to bust open
them candy guts, yo!

01:38.141 --> 01:41.101
Ah, birthdays are the best!

01:41.144 --> 01:42.450
I would not know.

01:42.493 --> 01:45.148
For I do not have
the birthday of my own.

01:45.192 --> 01:47.933
What? Come on,
everybody's got a birthday.

01:47.977 --> 01:51.023
It is true that I was birthed,
and on a day, yes.

01:51.067 --> 01:54.940
But, you see, I was born on a day that
does not exist upon the Earthen calendar.

01:54.984 --> 01:56.638
How is that possible?

01:56.681 --> 01:59.423
You see, a full revolution
of the Earth around its Sun

01:59.467 --> 02:04.167
takes 365.265 days according to
Aunt Gregorian's calendar system.

02:04.211 --> 02:06.430
Tamaran, being the eighth
planet from our star

02:06.474 --> 02:08.171
takes longer on
its orbital trip.

02:08.215 --> 02:13.698
60,190 days or 164.79 Earth
years to be precise.

02:13.742 --> 02:17.354
Thus, we have the many additional
months and days in our calendar system.

02:17.398 --> 02:20.314
It was on one of those
additional days that I was born

02:20.357 --> 02:22.968
and there is no
earthly equivalent.

02:23.012 --> 02:25.667
And so, each year I must watch

02:25.710 --> 02:29.845
as others are celebrated while I stand
alone as she who has no birthday.

02:29.888 --> 02:32.195
- No birthday?
- No birthday.

02:33.718 --> 02:36.460
- That's so sad.
- It is the saddest.

02:36.504 --> 02:38.288
My heart's breaking dude.

02:38.332 --> 02:42.031
I shall never experience the sweet
embrace of the birthday party.

02:46.862 --> 02:48.298
It ain't right, yo!

02:48.342 --> 02:50.822
You know what, Star?
You can share my birthday.

02:50.866 --> 02:52.476
For the reals?

02:52.520 --> 02:56.001
- For the real reals, girl.
- Whoa.

02:56.045 --> 02:58.830
Beast Boy, sharing your
birthday is a big deal.

02:58.874 --> 03:02.530
It's cool. My b-day is big
enough for the both of us.

03:02.573 --> 03:04.488
You're gonna have
to share your cake.

03:04.532 --> 03:06.838
- And your presents!
- So what?

03:06.882 --> 03:10.233
So? No one has ever shared
a birthday and enjoyed it.

03:10.277 --> 03:12.017
It's the hardest thing
to do in the world.

03:12.061 --> 03:14.194
Well, we's gonna be
the first, Mama.

03:14.237 --> 03:16.935
'Cause sharing and birthdays
is what I'm all about.

03:16.979 --> 03:19.503
Joy! My first birthday!

03:19.547 --> 03:20.722
That's right, girl.

03:20.765 --> 03:22.376
B-b-b-birthday.

03:22.419 --> 03:23.594
Birthday!

03:34.388 --> 03:36.738
All right, Starry,
Starry, Starry.

03:36.781 --> 03:38.870
You ready to blow out
them candles?

03:38.914 --> 03:41.569
Oh my, I will
extinguish the flames

03:41.612 --> 03:45.050
as my ancestors extinguished the
blood lines of their enemies.

03:45.094 --> 03:46.922
That's what's up!
Hit it, yo.

- Let's do it again.
- Just eat your cake!

05:04.695 --> 05:06.480
- Yeah boy!
- Whoo!

05:13.400 --> 05:15.663
Yo, why's my presents
in her pile?

05:15.706 --> 05:17.621
Remember, you have
to share your presents.

05:17.665 --> 05:20.450
That's... That's...

05:20.494 --> 05:21.799
Fine.

05:21.843 --> 05:24.193
Sharing is great and I love it.

05:24.236 --> 05:26.630
Tofu! Cool! Thanks, Robin.

05:26.674 --> 05:28.676
You're welcome.

05:28.719 --> 05:30.504
I know how much you like those
disgusting wet blocks of protein.

05:31.548 --> 05:33.463
Oh, what a lovely drawing.

05:33.507 --> 05:36.248
Yeah, I drew it for Beasty
but I think it still works.

05:36.292 --> 05:39.208
It really captures the essence
of a lifelong friendship.

05:39.251 --> 05:41.341
I'll just open my next one.

05:41.384 --> 05:42.864
That one is from the me.

05:44.909 --> 05:46.868
More tofu. How thoughtful.

05:49.087 --> 05:50.262
From Raven.

05:52.700 --> 05:55.398
Oh, two of the movie tickets.

05:55.442 --> 05:58.532
Ooh, we should see the one about the
guys with the moms named Martha.

06:00.577 --> 06:01.839
I can't take it!

06:01.883 --> 06:03.363
First you blows out my candles,

06:03.406 --> 06:05.365
then you gets my
super cool drawing.

06:05.408 --> 06:07.584
Now you gets to go to the
movies with Mama Raven.

06:07.628 --> 06:10.892
You're stealing all my stuff
and ruining my birthday!

06:10.935 --> 06:13.373
- Whoa, dude, chill.
- Yeah.

06:13.416 --> 06:14.722
This was your idea.

06:14.765 --> 06:16.898
Why's you even let me
have an idea.

06:16.941 --> 06:19.117
You know I ain't
a dude of ideas.

06:19.161 --> 06:20.380
Give me my stuff!

06:20.423 --> 06:22.120
But the gifts were given to me.

06:22.164 --> 06:24.253
So what, my name was on the box.

06:24.296 --> 06:26.429
I did the tearing of
the wrapping paper,

06:26.473 --> 06:28.431
sealing the covenant
of the gift giving.

06:28.475 --> 06:30.302
I don't even know
what that means.

06:30.346 --> 06:32.522
Give me!

06:32.566 --> 06:35.090
Take it down a notch, you two!

06:35.133 --> 06:37.222
- Huh, fine.
- Huff.

06:37.266 --> 06:39.921
If you want to keep fighting, I
will wrap this party up right now.

06:39.964 --> 06:43.403
Or you can agree to be nice
and we'll do the pinata.

06:45.492 --> 06:47.537
I really wants to hit that.

06:47.581 --> 06:50.061
I too wish to see
the candy guts.

06:50.105 --> 06:51.933
All right, all right.
I'll be cool.

06:51.976 --> 06:54.239
I shall also be the
low temperature.

06:54.283 --> 06:58.592
But if you take even one piece of
my candy, I will end you, girl.

06:58.635 --> 07:03.161
I will wear your face as the pants
if you ruin my pinata times.

07:03.205 --> 07:05.250
Who's ready to have some fun?

07:05.294 --> 07:07.296
We are!

07:15.478 --> 07:17.785
Okay, here we go.

07:17.828 --> 07:19.264
Take turns, you two.

07:19.308 --> 07:20.570
And be nice.

07:20.614 --> 07:22.485
Oh, I'm a be real nice, dude.

07:22.529 --> 07:24.182
Just as long as
I get the first whack.

07:25.619 --> 07:27.795
Prepare to die, pinata!

07:27.838 --> 07:29.361
Hey, I gets the first whack!

07:29.405 --> 07:30.972
It's my birthday.

07:31.015 --> 07:34.932
It is the our birthday
and therefore, my birthday.

07:34.976 --> 07:38.153
Have you forgotten I gave you this
birthday and I can take it away?

07:38.196 --> 07:40.372
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
I said be nice.

07:40.416 --> 07:43.941
That's nice. It's my birthday
and it's all about me.

07:43.985 --> 07:45.726
And I'm going
to smash this pinata!

07:47.510 --> 07:51.166
Oh, it is the on!

07:51.209 --> 07:53.995
You and me pinata.
Prepare yourself!

07:54.038 --> 07:55.039
Ha-ha!

07:56.563 --> 07:58.695
I shall make this the painless.

08:02.525 --> 08:04.396
Give it to me!

08:06.703 --> 08:08.444
It is my birthday right!

08:16.452 --> 08:17.671
It's not your birthday!

08:17.714 --> 08:19.629
It was never,
ever your birthday!

08:19.673 --> 08:21.675
You ain't even have a birthday!

08:21.718 --> 08:22.850
- Ah!
- Oh!

08:22.893 --> 08:24.068
Oh! Ah!

08:27.245 --> 08:28.508
Ha-ha!

08:28.551 --> 08:31.032
Look at all those
candy guts, yo.

08:31.075 --> 08:32.990
Whoo! Oh, yeah!

08:33.034 --> 08:35.558
It's my birthday.
It's my b-day.

08:35.602 --> 08:38.866
It's a me day.
It's all about me, baby!

08:38.909 --> 08:42.565
All about me! Aw... man.

08:45.394 --> 08:47.744
Hey Star, uh, I'm really sorry.

08:47.788 --> 08:50.573
I didn't realize sharing
a birthday would be so hard.

08:50.617 --> 08:53.881
- Here's some candy.
- I apologize also.

08:53.924 --> 08:56.536
I wished only to enjoy
the birthday fun times.

08:56.579 --> 08:59.408
But in doing so
I took yours away.

08:59.451 --> 09:00.583
It's cool.

09:00.627 --> 09:02.672
- Still friends?
- Be always.

09:02.716 --> 09:05.240
Though I suppose I will have
to wait until the next year

09:05.283 --> 09:06.763
to do the pinata smashing.

09:06.807 --> 09:08.852
Star, it's your first birthday.

09:08.896 --> 09:11.420
I'm a make sure you gets
to hit a pinata.

09:15.424 --> 09:17.687
Okay, I'm ready.

09:17.731 --> 09:20.734
Wow, I can't believe, Beast Boy went
through all this trouble just so Star

09:20.777 --> 09:22.126
could have a pinata.

09:22.170 --> 09:24.564
Yeah! My man's share game
is on point.

09:24.607 --> 09:25.869
Let her rip, Star.

09:32.354 --> 09:33.790
Give me some of those.

09:35.487 --> 09:37.751
The happy birthday, Beast Boy.

09:37.794 --> 09:40.449
Happy birthday, Starfire.
