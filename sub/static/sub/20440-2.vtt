WEBVTT

00:14.982 --> 00:16.550
Ah.

00:16.617 --> 00:17.951
Here you go.

00:18.018 --> 00:20.488
Horace Tapscott.

00:20.554 --> 00:22.356
Hmm.

00:22.423 --> 00:23.757
Guessing...

00:25.059 --> 00:26.427
saxophone?

00:26.494 --> 00:28.062
Piano and
social justice.

00:28.129 --> 00:30.231
Hm. Sounds
progressive.

00:30.298 --> 00:32.233
Not exactly your
Blue Note groove.

00:32.300 --> 00:34.202
I'm trying to find
something you might like.

00:34.268 --> 00:36.404
I don't even have a turntable.

00:36.470 --> 00:39.773
You know, when the
Central Avenue clubs closed,

00:39.840 --> 00:42.076
Tapscott
formed the Pan African

00:42.143 --> 00:43.977
People's Arkestra.
It single-handedly

00:44.044 --> 00:45.713
kept the Leimert Park
music scene

00:45.779 --> 00:47.014
alive for years.

00:47.081 --> 00:48.649
Hmm.

00:52.286 --> 00:54.288
My father listens
to jazz, Harry.

00:54.355 --> 00:58.692
Me, I'm more Ozomatli
or Los Lobos. No offense.

00:58.759 --> 01:01.862
I'm not your father,
and I dig Los Lobos.

01:01.929 --> 01:03.497
- Hmm.
- No offense.

01:10.604 --> 01:12.206
Excuse me.

01:14.808 --> 01:16.610
The other woman?

01:16.677 --> 01:18.279
Girl.

01:20.013 --> 01:21.815
Keep telling yourself that.

01:29.357 --> 01:31.492
Dinner was fantastic.

01:31.559 --> 01:33.227
I got time to drive you home.

01:33.294 --> 01:36.264
Opposite directions,
and it's late.

01:36.330 --> 01:38.832
I have a crazy day
tomorrow.

01:38.899 --> 01:41.001
You got a crazy day
every day.

01:41.068 --> 01:42.770
Here's my Uber.

01:47.275 --> 01:48.876
Go home to your girl.

03:18.732 --> 03:21.502
**

05:11.244 --> 05:12.880
**

05:32.900 --> 05:35.636
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

05:35.703 --> 05:37.871
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

05:37.938 --> 05:40.908
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

05:40.974 --> 05:43.210
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

05:43.276 --> 05:46.279
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

05:46.346 --> 05:48.716
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

05:48.782 --> 05:52.085
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

05:52.152 --> 05:53.387
* I can't let go *

06:05.966 --> 06:07.935
* I feel *

06:14.775 --> 06:17.110
Watch the right side.
Slow down. Slow down.

06:17.177 --> 06:19.613
I want to-- I don't want
to drive like an old person.

06:19.680 --> 06:21.715
Well, these hillside streets
can be a little tricky,

06:21.782 --> 06:22.783
but you're doing great.

06:22.850 --> 06:24.552
You're doing really great.

06:24.618 --> 06:26.920
You were even later
last night.

06:26.987 --> 06:29.189
- Eyes on the road.
- It was, like, 3 a.m.

06:29.256 --> 06:30.524
I heard you come in.

06:30.591 --> 06:32.059
Okay, so what, you wanna
put me on a curfew now?

06:32.125 --> 06:33.727
Can I?

06:33.794 --> 06:36.396
Focus on the next thing,
not what's in front of you.

06:36.464 --> 06:39.967
The back of the turn,
not the beginning.

06:40.033 --> 06:43.604
You know, Anita Benitez
does not have a Facebook page.

06:43.671 --> 06:46.239
Yeah, well,
DAs deal with bad people.

06:46.306 --> 06:48.141
They tend to keep
a low profile.

06:48.208 --> 06:49.242
Eyes on the road,

06:49.309 --> 06:50.277
Maddie.

06:50.343 --> 06:52.379
Keep right. Keep right.

06:52.446 --> 06:54.582
Hands at 10 and 2.

06:57.751 --> 06:59.119
Perfect.

06:59.186 --> 07:00.888
You're doing great.

07:23.376 --> 07:24.444
You can relax now.

07:24.512 --> 07:26.847
I love you, too.
See you tonight.

07:32.252 --> 07:33.887
Oh, hey. Uh...

07:36.389 --> 07:37.424
Harry, right?

07:37.491 --> 07:39.326
Yeah.

07:39.392 --> 07:41.328
Phil Gentry.

07:41.394 --> 07:42.763
I was hoping
I'd run into you.

07:42.830 --> 07:44.732
- Hey, Maddie.
- Hey.

07:45.699 --> 07:47.535
So is Maddie
liking volleyball?

07:47.601 --> 07:49.036
I hear she's
an absolute stud.

07:50.738 --> 07:51.772
She's having fun.

07:51.839 --> 07:53.607
Yeah, my Becca's the setter.

07:53.674 --> 07:57.077
They're good friends.
She convinced her to try out.

07:57.144 --> 07:59.179
You know, listen,
I just want you to know

07:59.246 --> 08:01.114
that all the parents here,
we really admire what you do.

08:01.181 --> 08:04.317
We've never had a--
a cop who was a dad before.

08:04.384 --> 08:07.154
I mean--
I mean a dad who was a--

08:07.220 --> 08:08.221
Something I can do for you?

08:10.223 --> 08:13.426
Yeah, well, um...

08:13.493 --> 08:15.128
I was maybe doing 50

08:15.195 --> 08:16.429
on that stretch of Third

08:16.496 --> 08:18.065
over by Larchmont,
but everybody does.

08:18.131 --> 08:19.332
It's a 35 zone.

08:19.399 --> 08:21.301
Yeah, and I back off,

08:21.368 --> 08:24.471
but this motorcycle cop was
running this speed trap there,

08:24.538 --> 08:26.339
and, uh...

08:26.406 --> 08:28.375
and I was just wondering,

08:28.441 --> 08:29.910
um...

08:34.347 --> 08:36.516
Thank you.

08:42.055 --> 08:44.524
Want you to take
the lead on this.

08:45.726 --> 08:47.494
And remember,
it's a murder scene

08:47.561 --> 08:49.062
until we prove it's not.

08:53.300 --> 08:54.635
Landlord.

09:04.011 --> 09:06.113
Victim is male,

09:06.179 --> 09:08.015
50-ish...

09:08.081 --> 09:09.016
white.

09:12.252 --> 09:13.621
Jesus.

09:13.687 --> 09:15.488
Looks like he landed
head first.

09:15.555 --> 09:17.591
See but don't assume.

09:19.259 --> 09:20.493
I.D.?

09:20.560 --> 09:22.930
Rhodes is talking
to the landlord now.

09:24.965 --> 09:27.601
Public easement--
easy access,

09:27.668 --> 09:30.137
but screened
from the street.

09:30.203 --> 09:32.773
Security camera
pointed the wrong way.

09:34.842 --> 09:37.344
Yeah. What a surprise.

09:37.410 --> 09:39.179
I'll go door-to-door.

09:39.246 --> 09:40.848
- Officer Rhodes.
- Detective.

09:40.914 --> 09:42.315
What fresh hell we got here?

09:43.583 --> 09:47.587
Well, the vic lives
right upstairs.

09:47.655 --> 09:50.323
And, uh...

09:50.390 --> 09:52.225
looks to be
a straight shot.

09:52.292 --> 09:53.827
Last name Gunn.

09:55.062 --> 09:57.330
You told this asshole
you'd look out for him?

09:57.397 --> 09:58.732
I didn't want
to go off on him

09:58.799 --> 10:00.333
in front of Maddie
and her friends.

10:02.836 --> 10:04.738
There. Taken care of.

10:04.805 --> 10:06.373
You better warn Maddie
that her best friend's dad

10:06.439 --> 10:08.375
is gonna have a warrant on
his ass in about 30 days.

10:08.441 --> 10:10.744
- They're not best friends.
- Just saying.

10:10.811 --> 10:13.280
That was possibly
the most useless autopsy

10:13.346 --> 10:14.848
we've been to in a while.

10:14.915 --> 10:16.416
When are you going to learn?

10:16.483 --> 10:17.751
What the fuck
am I supposed to do?

10:17.818 --> 10:19.452
Dress down on morgue days.
Dress like me.

10:22.189 --> 10:24.157
- Bosch.
- Robertson.

10:24.224 --> 10:26.059
We just rolled on a jumper,
and what do you know?

10:26.126 --> 10:29.329
The guy's got a flag
call Harry Bosch.

10:29.396 --> 10:30.397
What's the name?

10:30.463 --> 10:32.632
Gunn. Edward James.

10:32.700 --> 10:34.367
Where is he?

10:34.434 --> 10:36.737
His apartment.
It's on 42--

10:36.804 --> 10:38.371
On our way.

10:38.438 --> 10:40.007
What was that?

10:40.073 --> 10:41.742
Summer of '08.

10:41.809 --> 10:44.044
Victims were
two working girls

10:44.111 --> 10:46.446
who used the same
escort website.

10:46.513 --> 10:47.848
Killed
in a similar fashion--

10:47.915 --> 10:51.351
abducted, tortured,

10:51.418 --> 10:52.920
bodies dumped in alleys.

10:52.986 --> 10:55.188
Seven years
we've been partners,

10:55.255 --> 10:57.390
never once have you talked
about Edward Gunn.

10:57.457 --> 10:59.092
Not a case
we worked together.

10:59.159 --> 11:00.694
You've got him flagged,
Harry.

11:00.761 --> 11:04.131
Anyway, we had Gunn
good for both murders

11:04.197 --> 11:06.166
and possibly some others
we didn't even know about,

11:06.233 --> 11:08.836
but O'Shea was getting
ready to run for DA.

11:08.902 --> 11:10.670
Didn't have the balls
to file

11:10.738 --> 11:12.305
because it wasn't
a 100% sure thing.

11:12.372 --> 11:14.174
You've been keeping tabs
on a serial killer

11:14.241 --> 11:16.276
- and didn't tell me.
- Never came up.

11:16.343 --> 11:17.610
And the other night?

11:17.677 --> 11:20.547
Gunn showed up in
the Rampart drunk tank.

11:20.613 --> 11:21.982
I dropped by to see

11:22.049 --> 11:24.885
if he wanted to clear
his conscience, confess.

11:24.952 --> 11:26.854
He was dead drunk.

11:26.920 --> 11:29.189
Went back the next morning,
he was gone.

11:29.256 --> 11:31.992
- Somebody bailed him out.
- Who?

11:33.593 --> 11:35.628
I do not know.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.197
- Gentlemen.
- Hey.

11:41.201 --> 11:42.870
Kid here thinks
it's a suicide.

11:42.936 --> 11:45.338
There's a note.
And it looks like he downed

11:45.405 --> 11:47.474
a heavy dose of liquid
courage to get up the nerve.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.442
I keep telling him,
don't jump to conclusions.

11:49.509 --> 11:52.545
Look small, find large.
Look large, find small.

11:52.612 --> 11:54.714
- I'm partnered with Yoda.
- Hey, Yoda, my ass.

11:54.782 --> 11:56.984
Why don't you give 'em a tour
so we can finish up here?

12:10.563 --> 12:12.132
Is that a "murse"?

12:12.199 --> 12:15.002
It's my homicide kit.
Don't give me shit.

12:15.068 --> 12:17.170
My wife gave it to me
when I made rank.

12:17.237 --> 12:18.271
Handsome.

12:19.873 --> 12:21.708
Yeah, yeah.

12:21.775 --> 12:23.343
What's your history
with this guy?

12:23.410 --> 12:25.012
Case that got away.

12:25.078 --> 12:27.714
That itch that can't
ever be scratched, eh?

12:27.781 --> 12:29.116
I know the feeling.

12:31.284 --> 12:32.252
Point of impact?

12:34.721 --> 12:36.656
Kinda close
to the building, no?

12:36.723 --> 12:37.891
Yep.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.270
What's up?

12:50.337 --> 12:52.840
Depleted quart
of Gentleman Jim.

12:53.941 --> 12:55.909
There's your confession,
Harry.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.416
"I'm sorry."

13:04.852 --> 13:08.021
That's remorse,
not a confession.

13:12.159 --> 13:14.727
Could've gotten drunk
and fell over the balcony.

13:14.794 --> 13:16.396
That's what my partner says.

13:16.463 --> 13:18.331
Pierce!

13:18.398 --> 13:19.867
Now what?

14:25.498 --> 14:27.167
Bosch?

14:27.234 --> 14:28.535
Hey.

14:34.007 --> 14:36.543
You see something else
you want to share?

14:36.609 --> 14:38.578
No, I'm good.

14:38.645 --> 14:40.313
Have fun.

14:40.380 --> 14:42.015
Always.

14:59.732 --> 15:00.968
Where are we on Meadows?

15:01.034 --> 15:02.369
Autopsy confirmed his I.D.

15:02.435 --> 15:04.404
and that he was a habitual
abuser of opioids.

15:04.471 --> 15:06.539
Patrol's looking for the tagger
as a possible witness,

15:06.606 --> 15:09.376
and I gotta write a warrant
for the storage bin.

15:09.442 --> 15:10.677
How's Bosch?

15:10.743 --> 15:13.713
He's pretty focused
on the Holland trial prep.

15:13.780 --> 15:15.148
And you know how he gets.

15:15.215 --> 15:16.849
Don't dance with me,
Jerry.

15:16.916 --> 15:18.685
It's not what I meant
and you know it.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.420
Come on, this O'Shea thing.

15:20.487 --> 15:23.290
Harry's got a bulls-eye
on his back again.

15:23.356 --> 15:24.857
I think he's
well aware of that.

15:24.924 --> 15:27.027
I worry that he likes it
in his present mood.

15:27.094 --> 15:28.528
What mood is that?

15:28.595 --> 15:30.630
Cranky, cantankerous.

15:30.697 --> 15:32.499
I can't speak to his moods.

15:34.067 --> 15:35.302
You could.

15:35.368 --> 15:37.170
I guess I have to respect
that you won't.

15:40.173 --> 15:41.408
Detective, hey.

15:41.474 --> 15:43.210
Found my shake
on that tagger.

15:43.276 --> 15:45.712
Thomas Niese. Goes by
Sharkey on the street.

15:45.778 --> 15:47.314
A long rap
of juvie hijinks.

15:47.380 --> 15:50.450
Ah, great, Edge.
Thank you.

16:18.478 --> 16:19.412
Hey.

16:21.148 --> 16:22.815
Buy me a 40?

16:22.882 --> 16:25.085
How old are you?

16:25.952 --> 16:27.154
I got money.

16:28.355 --> 16:30.590
Come on, buy me a 40.
We can take it and chill.

17:21.108 --> 17:23.009
Don't touch that.

17:23.076 --> 17:24.577
I said don't touch that.

17:24.644 --> 17:25.678
Dude.

17:31.951 --> 17:34.287
Hey. No, no,
not while I'm driving.

17:34.354 --> 17:36.156
Really? That's what
you're worried about?

17:36.223 --> 17:37.957
An open container?

17:38.024 --> 17:39.292
Where are we going?

17:39.359 --> 17:40.827
Make a right here.

17:45.765 --> 17:47.134
Right up there
on the curb

17:47.200 --> 17:48.701
behind the dumpster.

17:55.708 --> 17:56.709
Here?

17:56.776 --> 17:58.211
Yeah.

18:19.566 --> 18:21.100
Can we do this
in the back?

18:21.168 --> 18:24.437
Okay. Sure.

18:37.817 --> 18:40.620
- Expensive car.
- Uh-huh.

18:40.687 --> 18:42.021
Good taste.

18:42.088 --> 18:44.191
- Oh! What the--
- Motherfucker!

18:48.261 --> 18:51.097
Jesus Christ.
What the fuck is this?

18:51.164 --> 18:53.533
Let's go, let's go.

18:55.335 --> 18:57.704
Get a new flaptop,
motherfucker.

18:57.770 --> 18:59.572
This one sucks.

19:00.807 --> 19:01.808
Come on, let's go.

19:05.712 --> 19:08.815
**

19:45.084 --> 19:46.619
Mr. Holland,
open the door.

19:46.686 --> 19:48.755
- I got my lawyer coming.
- Yeah, okay, good.

19:48.821 --> 19:50.690
You break one fucking
thing in this house,

19:50.757 --> 19:52.158
I'm suing you,

19:52.225 --> 19:53.526
and I'm suing
the fucking LAPD.

19:53.593 --> 19:55.328
Go ahead because
everyone else does.

19:55.395 --> 19:56.996
Oh, that's
your idea of wit?

19:57.063 --> 19:58.298
Yes, it is.

19:58.365 --> 20:00.600
Hey, hey, buddy,
I'm telling you,

20:00.667 --> 20:02.902
you put one scratch
on anything--

20:02.969 --> 20:04.737
Don't worry Mr. Holland.
We'll be careful.

20:04.804 --> 20:07.907
Shut-- Get that thing
out of my freaking face.

20:07.974 --> 20:09.476
Okay. Lovely. There's that.

20:09.542 --> 20:11.444
Tell me about this statement
from Mr. Holland, detective.

20:11.511 --> 20:13.713
We were packed up.
Leaving. Camera was off.

20:13.780 --> 20:15.448
I was last one out
because I needed

20:15.515 --> 20:17.149
to give him a copy
of the search warrant,

20:17.216 --> 20:18.385
and I did so at the door.

20:18.451 --> 20:20.320
Mr. Fowkkes,
did you witness this?

20:20.387 --> 20:22.221
No, I was on a, uh,
phone call, Your Honor,

20:22.289 --> 20:23.856
- in another room.
- Mr. Holland asked me

20:23.923 --> 20:25.658
if we had found
what we were looking for.

20:25.725 --> 20:27.560
I said no, and,
as we walking outside,

20:27.627 --> 20:29.028
he said,
"And you won't, either."

20:29.095 --> 20:31.097
Sounds like he was
professing his innocence.

20:31.163 --> 20:32.299
Those were his words,

20:32.365 --> 20:33.766
but that wasn't
his tone of voice.

20:33.833 --> 20:36.503
Tone of voice?
Your Honor, really?

20:36.569 --> 20:38.505
Let him finish.
What was his tone?

20:38.571 --> 20:40.373
Taunting. At that point,

20:40.440 --> 20:42.342
Mr. Holland wasn't
officially a suspect,

20:42.409 --> 20:43.776
so I took a wild shot.

20:43.843 --> 20:45.645
I said,
"You did it, didn't you?"

20:45.712 --> 20:47.914
He smiled and said, "And I'll
get away with it, too."

20:47.980 --> 20:50.850
Your Honor, no one else heard
this alleged conversation

20:50.917 --> 20:52.852
- except Detective Bosch.
- And that's not all.

20:52.919 --> 20:54.721
- He said one more thing.
- Go on.

20:54.787 --> 20:56.589
Mr. Holland
looked at me and said,

20:56.656 --> 20:58.257
"I am a god in this town,
detective,

20:58.325 --> 20:59.792
and you don't fuck
with the gods."

20:59.859 --> 21:00.893
Preposterous.

21:00.960 --> 21:03.162
Your Honor, Detective Bosch
has a long history

21:03.229 --> 21:04.564
of investigative misconduct--

21:04.631 --> 21:06.433
Your Honor, a defendant's
own voluntary

21:06.499 --> 21:08.301
out-of-court statements
are a hearsay exception

21:08.368 --> 21:10.169
and can be used
against him at trial.

21:10.236 --> 21:11.604
She's right, Mr. Fowkkes.

21:11.671 --> 21:14.974
Detective Bosch fabricated
this entire conversation.

21:15.041 --> 21:17.377
And you're welcome
to attack the credibility
of the witness.

21:17.444 --> 21:19.312
The jury will sort it out.
It's called a trial.

21:19.379 --> 21:21.948
No, no, no, no, no.
Do not do the "unringing
the bell" trope.

21:22.014 --> 21:23.883
No. Do not go there,
not in my court.

21:23.950 --> 21:25.051
Your motion to suppress

21:25.117 --> 21:26.252
the testimony
of Detective Bosch

21:26.319 --> 21:27.487
is denied.

21:36.162 --> 21:37.664
Death report on Gunn.

21:37.730 --> 21:39.866
Be sure to tell Bosch
I omitted the part

21:39.932 --> 21:42.001
where he fucked up the
crime scene with his prints.

21:42.068 --> 21:43.202
No way.

21:43.269 --> 21:45.171
On a glass
with whiskey in it.

21:45.237 --> 21:46.539
Harry always gloves up.

21:46.606 --> 21:47.640
Apparently, not always.

21:47.707 --> 21:49.108
I saw him glove up,
Jimmy.

21:49.175 --> 21:50.910
Lab don't lie, J. Edgar.

21:52.211 --> 21:53.646
I should probably
tell Billets,

21:53.713 --> 21:56.716
but, you know,
I'm not that kind of guy.

22:23.576 --> 22:24.944
Robertson's write-up
on Gunn.

22:25.011 --> 22:27.814
Pretty thin.
Guess an elephant hunter

22:27.880 --> 22:29.248
doesn't want
to waste too much time

22:29.315 --> 22:30.349
with small game.

22:30.417 --> 22:31.918
Says you left prints
at the scene.

22:31.984 --> 22:34.020
Robertson's full of shit.
Never happened.

22:34.086 --> 22:35.888
Look at my screen, Harry.

22:37.123 --> 22:38.558
It's not
just Jimmy saying it.

22:38.625 --> 22:40.560
It's latent prints.

22:46.899 --> 22:48.000
Ah, shit.

22:48.067 --> 22:51.003
I took off my glove
to work my phone screen--

22:51.070 --> 22:53.840
the picture I sent to O'Shea
of the suicide note.

22:53.906 --> 22:55.942
I must have moved the glass
to get a clear shot.

22:56.008 --> 22:57.910
Is he being all
self-righteous about this?

22:57.977 --> 22:59.311
Yeah.

22:59.378 --> 23:02.114
But he left it out of the
report, so there's that.

23:03.850 --> 23:05.418
You headed back downtown?

23:05.485 --> 23:07.019
Annabelle Crowe.
Dress rehearsal.

23:07.086 --> 23:08.287
How's our Meadows warrant?

23:08.354 --> 23:10.022
Oh. I'm on it. Almost done.

23:10.089 --> 23:11.491
You're not writing a novel.

23:15.261 --> 23:16.463
The jury's gonna wonder

23:16.529 --> 23:18.565
why you waited a year
to call the police.

23:18.631 --> 23:20.166
I was embarrassed, okay?

23:20.232 --> 23:22.902
Andrew Holland is an important
person in my business.

23:22.969 --> 23:26.606
Is that why you
didn't show the bruises
on your neck to anyone?

23:26.673 --> 23:29.809
Why you erased
his voicemail message?

23:29.876 --> 23:32.912
I just kept thinking,
like...

23:32.979 --> 23:35.482
What if I had it wrong?
You know.

23:35.548 --> 23:38.284
You hear
about Hollywood people,

23:38.350 --> 23:39.786
weird sex, I don't know.

23:39.852 --> 23:42.254
Maybe I was just
being a prude,

23:42.321 --> 23:44.891
not chill enough about it.

23:44.957 --> 23:50.162
Okay. Dinner, drinks, back
to Andrew Holland's house.

23:50.229 --> 23:52.298
It all seemed
perfectly normal.

23:52.364 --> 23:53.933
Yes.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.569
We did some Molly,
fooled around.

23:56.636 --> 23:57.604
Clothes came off.

23:57.670 --> 23:59.906
- Consensual.
- Yeah.

23:59.972 --> 24:03.275
But he didn't like me
touching him.

24:03.342 --> 24:06.913
He wanted
to control everything.

24:06.979 --> 24:10.216
After a while,
he moved behind me.

24:10.282 --> 24:13.553
I felt his hands
around my neck.

24:13.620 --> 24:15.454
He squeezed.

24:15.522 --> 24:17.256
I couldn't breathe.

24:17.323 --> 24:18.658
Did you tell him to stop?

24:19.559 --> 24:21.127
I tried. I couldn't.

24:21.193 --> 24:23.295
I couldn't speak.

24:23.362 --> 24:25.965
I tried to get
out from under him,

24:26.032 --> 24:27.199
but he was too strong.

24:29.602 --> 24:31.871
And then he was--

24:35.107 --> 24:37.777
he was moving inside me,

24:37.844 --> 24:43.249
and it was all I could do
to just--

24:50.322 --> 24:51.691
And then?

24:53.125 --> 24:54.160
Nothing.

24:54.226 --> 24:55.695
I blacked out.

24:57.363 --> 25:01.634
I woke up alone in his bed
naked on top of the covers.

25:01.701 --> 25:04.571
I could hear
the shower running.

25:04.637 --> 25:06.539
I found my clothes
in a bag--

25:06.606 --> 25:08.541
in a black plastic
garbage bag--

25:08.608 --> 25:10.577
by the bedroom door.

25:12.044 --> 25:14.714
My purse
had been emptied out.

25:14.781 --> 25:18.017
I saw my phone,
but I couldn't find my keys.

25:18.084 --> 25:22.188
I started to get dressed,
and I heard the shower stop.

25:23.422 --> 25:24.857
I grabbed the whole bag,

25:24.924 --> 25:27.994
and I ran out the door,
down the driveway,

25:28.060 --> 25:30.062
through the front gate,
and...

25:36.703 --> 25:39.238
I hid in the shadows
and got dressed.

25:40.573 --> 25:45.211
And I walked until I
had cell phone reception

25:45.277 --> 25:46.312
so I could call a cab.

25:46.378 --> 25:49.148
And why not the police
right then?

25:49.215 --> 25:52.051
He had already left me
a voicemail on my cell,

25:52.118 --> 25:55.354
worried about where I'd gone,
saying I'd forgotten my keys,

25:55.421 --> 25:57.123
and saying he was sorry

25:57.189 --> 25:59.325
that things had gotten
carried away, and he--

26:01.560 --> 26:03.696
he thought
I was really into it.

26:06.432 --> 26:08.234
He just wanted
to satisfy me.

26:08.300 --> 26:10.903
Did he explain
why he had to take a shower

26:10.970 --> 26:12.772
after he'd choked you out?

26:14.206 --> 26:16.208
What did you think
the garbage bag meant?

26:16.275 --> 26:17.409
The empty purse?

26:17.476 --> 26:18.878
I don't know.

26:18.945 --> 26:21.413
He was getting rid
of the evidence.

26:21.480 --> 26:23.382
He thought you were dead.

26:23.449 --> 26:25.652
Bosch.

26:25.718 --> 26:27.887
Let her tell it her way.

26:31.958 --> 26:33.960
I tried to forget about it.

26:46.172 --> 26:48.708
But when I read
about him being arrested

26:48.775 --> 26:50.509
for the murder
of Donatella Spear,

26:50.576 --> 26:51.811
I thought--

26:57.750 --> 27:00.586
If I had said something,
she might still be alive.

27:00.653 --> 27:01.821
No she wouldn't.

27:04.824 --> 27:07.059
A guy like this...

27:07.126 --> 27:10.997
keeps stretching
till he snaps.

27:12.131 --> 27:14.033
You're just lucky
it wasn't you.

27:19.438 --> 27:20.639
How'd he seem?

27:20.707 --> 27:22.909
Bosch? Wound up.

27:22.975 --> 27:24.877
Really anxious to talk
to that knucklehead.

27:24.944 --> 27:26.979
Bosch said Gunn
was too drunk to talk.

27:27.046 --> 27:29.115
Yeah, he was out.
I felt bad.

27:29.181 --> 27:31.217
When I called him,
Gunn was conscious.

27:31.283 --> 27:33.686
Otherwise, I wouldn't
have called him
at home at that hour.

27:33.753 --> 27:35.487
You've called Bosch
on Gunn before?

27:35.554 --> 27:37.023
Oh, yeah.

27:37.089 --> 27:41.093
Going back at least three,
four times on my watch.

27:51.037 --> 27:53.172
- J. Edgar.
- Hey.

27:53.239 --> 27:55.174
Coroner ruled
Gunn's death a homicide.

27:55.241 --> 27:56.976
Somebody held him
by the ankles

27:57.043 --> 27:58.745
and dropped him on his head.

27:58.811 --> 28:00.679
Congratulations.

28:00.747 --> 28:02.514
Means I probably won't
be able to protect Harry

28:02.581 --> 28:04.350
from his fuck-up
with the prints.

28:04.416 --> 28:06.118
It's gonna come up.

28:06.185 --> 28:07.153
No doubt.

28:18.230 --> 28:19.365
Ladies.

28:20.699 --> 28:24.036
Whoa. Good God, man,
don't drink that.

28:24.103 --> 28:25.504
You out of your mind?

28:25.571 --> 28:26.839
Ugh.

28:26.906 --> 28:29.375
This is Crate's brew.

28:29.441 --> 28:30.877
This shit tastes

28:30.943 --> 28:33.445
like it's fashioned
from pencil shavings.

28:33.512 --> 28:35.414
Gugh. Here.

28:35.481 --> 28:38.117
Take that. Ugh.

28:39.351 --> 28:40.652
All right, Jerry,

28:40.719 --> 28:42.822
do not tell anyone.

28:48.360 --> 28:50.696
Green Mountain Kenyan.

28:50.763 --> 28:53.732
I have to hide it
from the hoi polloi.

28:53.800 --> 28:54.901
Okay.

28:54.967 --> 28:56.903
So that, my friend,

28:56.969 --> 29:00.672
will set the world
right on its axis.

29:00.739 --> 29:03.776
And your bowels
will thank me later.

29:17.924 --> 29:19.892
Probably like that.

29:21.193 --> 29:23.462
Yeah, but if you
turned it around--

29:23.529 --> 29:26.198
if it was like this,
if this means anything...

29:27.934 --> 29:29.468
Why do you keep
looking at that?

29:31.603 --> 29:32.939
Gunn's now a murder.

29:33.005 --> 29:35.207
Drop seemed odd.

29:41.180 --> 29:43.315
You still worrying
over my prints, Jerry?

29:43.382 --> 29:45.084
You're not?

29:47.954 --> 29:49.621
How was Crowe?

29:49.688 --> 29:51.790
I don't know.
There's something
she's holding back.

29:51.858 --> 29:53.259
About Holland or herself?

29:53.325 --> 29:55.027
Somewhere
in the intersection.

29:55.094 --> 29:56.963
Benitez agree with you?

29:57.029 --> 29:59.832
She thinks I'm hung up on
all the ones that got away.

29:59.899 --> 30:01.300
Perceptive.

30:01.367 --> 30:02.401
Fuck you.

30:11.777 --> 30:14.046
All right.
Every police officer

30:14.113 --> 30:18.250
brings different
needs and values--

30:18.317 --> 30:21.954
values and perceptions
to the workplace.

30:22.021 --> 30:24.123
So special--

30:24.190 --> 30:26.092
Yes. Come in.

30:26.158 --> 30:27.927
You got a minute,
Lieutenant?

30:27.994 --> 30:29.728
Oh, sure. Come. Sit down.

30:29.795 --> 30:31.330
Let me know
if Harry looks over

30:31.397 --> 30:32.598
or starts to come in.

30:35.334 --> 30:36.335
What's going on?

30:41.640 --> 30:42.608
Hey.

30:42.674 --> 30:43.642
You all right?

30:43.709 --> 30:45.711
Why? Do I seem off?

30:45.777 --> 30:48.881
A little more opaque
than the usual.

30:48.948 --> 30:51.550
Sorry. I got a lot going on.

30:51.617 --> 30:53.319
We both do.

30:57.924 --> 30:59.091
Are we good?

30:59.158 --> 31:00.826
Oh. I'm gonna take
another hard look

31:00.893 --> 31:02.128
at Annabelle Crowe.

31:03.896 --> 31:05.797
I never doubted you would.

31:05.864 --> 31:07.599
Then we're good.

31:13.672 --> 31:14.873
Shit.

31:14.941 --> 31:16.208
That's what I keep saying.

31:16.275 --> 31:18.277
Still, it doesn't
exactly add up

31:18.344 --> 31:21.047
to Harry's come off the chain
and become an avenging angel.

31:21.113 --> 31:22.381
He's been a different person

31:22.448 --> 31:24.250
since he solved
his mom's murder.

31:24.316 --> 31:25.451
Her killer got away with it.

31:25.517 --> 31:28.220
Edward Gunn got away
with two, at least.

31:28.287 --> 31:29.821
And Veronica Allen walked.

31:29.888 --> 31:32.191
Harry's a lot of things,
but he is not a cold blooded--

31:32.258 --> 31:33.692
I agree with you.
I agree.

31:33.759 --> 31:35.294
But he's lying
about his prints

31:35.361 --> 31:36.728
and I don't know
what else.

31:36.795 --> 31:37.964
Shit.

31:38.030 --> 31:40.032
Robertson
is a good detective.

31:40.099 --> 31:41.867
A lot like Harry.

31:41.934 --> 31:43.402
He's old school,
dogged.

31:43.469 --> 31:44.937
- I know.
- I mean, ask yourself this,

31:45.004 --> 31:46.805
right? If Harry
found your prints

31:46.872 --> 31:48.040
- at the murder scene--
- Here he comes.

31:48.107 --> 31:49.475
You see what I'm saying?

31:49.541 --> 31:50.642
I do.

31:51.743 --> 31:53.379
Come in.

31:53.445 --> 31:54.246
Hey.

31:54.313 --> 31:55.814
Gotta go pick up my daughter.

31:55.881 --> 31:57.849
Okay. LT signed off
on the warrant,

31:57.916 --> 32:00.019
so I'll swing by court
in the morning

32:00.086 --> 32:01.620
and meet you at The Bin.

32:01.687 --> 32:02.821
Okay. I'm out.

32:02.888 --> 32:04.156
You have a good night.

32:07.259 --> 32:10.029
Rick Jackson
was Harry's partner

32:10.096 --> 32:11.563
on the original
Gunn investigation.

32:11.630 --> 32:12.864
He works Pacific now.

32:12.931 --> 32:14.366
Four years with Bosch
burned him out.

32:14.433 --> 32:16.068
- He fled to the beach.
- Seriously,

32:16.135 --> 32:17.403
we can compare scars.

32:17.469 --> 32:19.138
You're gonna have to
work this sub-rosa.

32:19.205 --> 32:21.073
Stay ahead of Robertson.

32:21.140 --> 32:23.475
Find out what the fuck
is going on.

32:29.948 --> 32:32.084
Hey, light?

32:34.153 --> 32:35.721
Good night.

32:35.787 --> 32:37.556
Good night. I'm tired.

32:37.623 --> 32:38.957
Later, bro.

33:12.658 --> 33:13.992
You were right.

33:15.727 --> 33:16.728
Check it out.

33:19.231 --> 33:21.567
It's like Gunn was
clawing at the opening

33:21.633 --> 33:23.669
to keep from getting
taken through it.

33:25.471 --> 33:27.239
Not on the wall by the door

33:27.306 --> 33:29.675
leading out
where he went over.

33:29.741 --> 33:32.344
- Because he--
- Where, presumably,

33:32.411 --> 33:34.946
he'd be fighting even
harder to stay inside,

33:35.013 --> 33:37.816
unless he couldn't.
What was his tox level?

33:37.883 --> 33:39.518
Borderline.

33:39.585 --> 33:41.187
Uh, I mean
.09 or something.

33:41.253 --> 33:43.489
It's not likely
he passed out.

33:43.555 --> 33:45.057
Yeah.

33:45.124 --> 33:46.692
But he could have
been made to

33:46.758 --> 33:49.628
between here and there.

33:50.896 --> 33:52.531
You bring the murder book?

33:54.733 --> 33:57.169
You learned carotid restraint
control at the Academy, right?

33:57.236 --> 33:59.238
A pain in the ass
to get right.

33:59.305 --> 34:01.340
You get it wrong,
it turns into a choke hold.

34:01.407 --> 34:03.609
People die.
Some of the time,

34:03.675 --> 34:06.112
we saw abrasion patterns
on suspects backs,

34:06.178 --> 34:07.513
like this.

34:07.579 --> 34:09.648
Think about the way
we brace the hold--

34:09.715 --> 34:11.150
one arm around the neck,

34:11.217 --> 34:12.618
the other one
across the back.

34:12.684 --> 34:14.820
So you can
control the pressure
on the neck arteries

34:14.886 --> 34:17.123
- with the angle of your arm.
- Mm-hmm.

34:17.189 --> 34:19.024
Now, these half circles
are abrasions

34:19.091 --> 34:20.426
caused by the bands
and bezels

34:20.492 --> 34:22.161
of those chunky
chrono wristwatches

34:22.228 --> 34:23.862
us O.G. cops
tend to favor.

34:23.929 --> 34:26.332
A cop made Gunn pass out?

34:26.398 --> 34:27.799
Then dragged him
to the balcony

34:27.866 --> 34:29.000
and dropped him head first.

34:29.067 --> 34:30.236
Not definitively.

34:30.302 --> 34:32.538
Military teaches it,
mixed martial arts.

34:32.604 --> 34:34.840
Anyone can find a how-to
on the internet.

34:34.906 --> 34:36.942
Or a cop of a certain age.

34:37.008 --> 34:38.277
Yeah.

34:39.478 --> 34:40.446
My age.

34:43.014 --> 34:44.216
Jesus.

34:44.283 --> 34:45.817
Cross Los Angeles Street,

34:45.884 --> 34:47.319
suddenly I'm in Calcutta.

34:47.386 --> 34:48.854
Dark side of gentrification.

34:48.920 --> 34:51.157
How much you wanna bet
those million-dollar lofts

34:51.223 --> 34:53.425
got windows
facing the other way?

34:53.492 --> 34:57.028
Patty, my partner
Harry Bosch.

34:57.095 --> 34:59.131
Hi, Patty.
Sorry I'm late.

34:59.198 --> 35:01.500
DWP is digging
random holes on Temple

35:01.567 --> 35:03.769
trying to see how far back
they can hold things up.

35:03.835 --> 35:06.338
You should get a traffic app
for your phone, detective.

35:06.405 --> 35:08.073
Then we could watch
his head explode.

35:08.140 --> 35:09.341
We go in here.

35:09.408 --> 35:10.876
So, Patty,
how secure are these?

35:10.942 --> 35:12.378
Well, they need ID to get in,

35:12.444 --> 35:14.546
but we tell them
not to leave anything
too valuable.

35:14.613 --> 35:15.847
They have to come back
every week

35:15.914 --> 35:17.883
to renew.
And demand is high.

35:17.949 --> 35:19.951
There's never enough.

35:20.018 --> 35:23.121
Let's see, Meadows--
1901.

35:23.189 --> 35:24.390
Oh, you're just in time.

35:24.456 --> 35:25.957
We were about
to empty his bin

35:26.024 --> 35:27.793
and give it
to somebody else.

35:27.859 --> 35:29.127
There.

35:29.195 --> 35:30.796
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

35:42.874 --> 35:44.776
Lieutenant Grace Billets?

35:44.843 --> 35:46.278
Sir.

35:51.983 --> 35:53.452
Hi. Grace Billets.

35:53.519 --> 35:54.286
Oh.

35:54.353 --> 35:55.587
Grace Billets.

35:57.423 --> 35:59.024
Grace, have a seat,
please.

35:59.090 --> 36:00.058
Thanks.

36:00.125 --> 36:01.293
You want a water
or something?

36:01.360 --> 36:02.328
Uh, no, thanks.

36:02.394 --> 36:03.962
Okay, let's get to it.

36:04.029 --> 36:05.497
We have 45 minutes,

36:05.564 --> 36:07.499
so please be concise
as you can.

36:07.566 --> 36:09.568
- I'll try.
- First off, an easy one.

36:09.635 --> 36:10.436
Mm-hmm.

36:10.502 --> 36:11.870
Briefly tell us about yourself

36:11.937 --> 36:15.874
and why you think you should
be promoted to captain.

36:15.941 --> 36:17.643
Well, my dad was a cop.

36:17.709 --> 36:20.178
My uncle
worked Valley Division.

36:20.246 --> 36:21.580
I was born here.

36:21.647 --> 36:23.415
I grew up in this city,
and I still live here,

36:23.482 --> 36:26.017
so I think that being
a legacy and a resident

36:26.084 --> 36:27.386
gives me a pretty clear
perspective

36:27.453 --> 36:29.187
on community policing.

36:32.558 --> 36:34.159
A person's whole life

36:34.226 --> 36:36.528
reduced to what fits
in a garbage can.

36:36.595 --> 36:37.929
This his foot locker?

36:40.866 --> 36:41.833
No.

36:43.335 --> 36:44.470
That's a Pelican case.

36:44.536 --> 36:46.171
That's what you use

36:46.238 --> 36:47.906
when you get
out of the service,

36:47.973 --> 36:49.708
not when you go in as a boot.

37:03.889 --> 37:05.324
Hunting trophy.

37:07.158 --> 37:08.727
There's a false bottom.

37:39.157 --> 37:41.827
He did multiple tours--

37:41.893 --> 37:42.994
Iraq...

37:44.863 --> 37:46.332
Afghanistan.

37:48.467 --> 37:50.268
Went back as a hired gun, too.

37:50.336 --> 37:51.870
The girl?

37:54.706 --> 37:57.443
They seem
so sure of themselves.

37:57.509 --> 37:59.645
You have to be.

37:59.711 --> 38:02.614
Because after that,
you're never so sure again.

38:05.684 --> 38:09.488
I ever tell you how I got
rid of the tats on my hands?

38:09.555 --> 38:10.722
No.

38:12.057 --> 38:14.225
H-O-L-D.

38:14.292 --> 38:17.028
F-A-S-T.

38:17.095 --> 38:19.631
Hold fast. To what?

38:21.833 --> 38:24.035
Life, brother.

38:24.102 --> 38:25.771
Everything.

38:27.673 --> 38:30.742
Anything you could grab on to
to keep from going under.

38:33.278 --> 38:35.481
Shit, I was just a kid.

38:37.315 --> 38:39.718
Saw it on tuna guys
down in Pedro.

38:40.986 --> 38:42.354
Ex-Navy.

38:42.421 --> 38:44.089
Some kind of sailor thing?

38:44.155 --> 38:45.657
Yeah.

38:49.861 --> 38:52.564
So anyways,
a couple years later,

38:52.631 --> 38:54.733
I enlisted in the Army.

38:54.800 --> 38:57.703
My sergeant at basic
saw it and flipped out.

38:57.769 --> 38:59.371
Said there's no way
he was gonna have

38:59.438 --> 39:01.106
a squid tattoo
on one of his soldiers,

39:01.172 --> 39:03.709
so he makes me go out behind
the back of the barracks

39:03.775 --> 39:05.744
and punch this
cinderblock wall

39:05.811 --> 39:09.247
till my knuckles
were like hamburger.

39:09.314 --> 39:11.583
When they scabbed over,

39:11.650 --> 39:14.853
he made me go back out...

39:14.920 --> 39:15.954
do it again...

39:18.189 --> 39:19.391
and again.

39:21.059 --> 39:22.494
That's crazy.

39:24.463 --> 39:26.965
I was all in with it.

39:27.032 --> 39:29.167
That's how sure we were.

39:29.234 --> 39:32.203
Stress can be a huge factor.

39:32.270 --> 39:35.340
Frustration with the slow
churn of justice.

39:35.407 --> 39:40.311
But if you tell people exactly
what they need to do and why,

39:40.378 --> 39:42.414
the majority
respond very positively

39:42.481 --> 39:44.783
and often exceed
expectations.

39:44.850 --> 39:46.718
Last question
is situational.

39:46.785 --> 39:48.420
Mm-hmm.

39:48.487 --> 39:51.457
A lieutenant under
your direct command

39:51.523 --> 39:54.493
has had an inappropriate
sexual relationship

39:54.560 --> 39:55.961
with one of her detectives.

39:58.464 --> 40:00.466
This detective comes to you

40:00.532 --> 40:02.868
and says that an unhappy
end to the affair

40:02.934 --> 40:07.238
is now affecting her caseload
and her path to promotion.

40:07.305 --> 40:10.175
How would you handle this?

40:15.914 --> 40:16.782
Hey.

40:16.848 --> 40:18.283
I've got so much math tonight.

40:18.349 --> 40:19.818
How was practice?

40:19.885 --> 40:20.786
Awesome.

40:20.852 --> 40:22.921
I learned
how to hit a pipe.

40:22.988 --> 40:24.456
Excuse me?

40:24.523 --> 40:26.357
It's a back row attack.

40:26.424 --> 40:27.826
Short set
behind the middle.

40:27.893 --> 40:29.495
Totally fakes out
the blockers.

40:29.561 --> 40:32.163
Oh, yeah, right.

40:32.230 --> 40:33.532
Hey, when can I
drive this one?

40:33.599 --> 40:35.300
As soon as you
get a badge.

40:35.366 --> 40:36.735
Oh.

40:36.802 --> 40:39.037
El Pollo Brasso
or In-N-Out?

40:39.104 --> 40:40.772
Mom's worried I'm not
eating healthy with you.

40:42.574 --> 40:44.743
Chicken is healthy.

40:44.810 --> 40:47.278
I was thinking
a Double-Double
with animal fries.

40:47.345 --> 40:49.648
Oh. In-N-Out.

40:49.715 --> 40:51.016
All major food groups.

40:54.252 --> 40:55.521
Just so you know--

40:55.587 --> 40:57.789
That favor you did
for Becca's dad?

40:59.691 --> 41:01.226
Yeah, what about it?

41:01.292 --> 41:03.194
Completely changed the way
the cool girls treat me now.

41:04.863 --> 41:06.431
How did they
treat you before?

41:06.498 --> 41:08.634
new school, fresh meat.

41:10.569 --> 41:12.370
Why didn't you
tell me that?

41:12.437 --> 41:13.805
Never came up.

41:14.973 --> 41:16.675
But anyways,
it's much better now.

41:16.742 --> 41:19.210
You know, sometimes
it sucks to be a cop's kid,

41:19.277 --> 41:20.912
and sometimes it rocks.

41:28.186 --> 41:29.621
You know, Maddie,

41:29.688 --> 41:31.657
it shouldn't matter
what the cool girls think.

41:31.723 --> 41:33.825
Yeah, I know. It shouldn't.

41:50.208 --> 41:53.745
He's my Inspector Javert,

41:53.812 --> 41:56.948
relentless in his pursuit
of false justice.

41:57.015 --> 42:01.019
The full weight of a corrupt
system brought to bear on me

42:01.086 --> 42:06.357
by its woefully inept
agent provocateur.

42:06.424 --> 42:07.525
Les Miz.

42:07.593 --> 42:09.260
Sterling Hayden
in The Godfather.

42:09.327 --> 42:10.495
Character name?

42:10.562 --> 42:11.997
Captain McCluskey.

42:13.765 --> 42:15.834
- Dudley Smith.
- L.A. Confidential.

42:15.901 --> 42:17.869
He's your
Porfiry Petrovich.

42:17.936 --> 42:19.270
Crime and Punishment.

42:19.337 --> 42:20.972
Wrong.

42:21.039 --> 42:22.841
Raskolnikov was
guilty of that crime,

42:22.908 --> 42:24.576
not unjustly accused.

42:24.643 --> 42:25.911
It's so unfair.

42:25.977 --> 42:28.113
That's what makes it
so compelling.

42:29.514 --> 42:31.583
The blameless protagonist--

42:31.650 --> 42:33.384
yours truly--

42:33.451 --> 42:37.789
swept up
in a pulp-novel fiction

42:37.856 --> 42:44.863
spun by this self-appointed
accuser and executioner.

42:49.200 --> 42:52.070
But he will get his hard
reversal in the final act,

42:52.137 --> 42:55.073
when all mysteries
are revealed.

43:59.738 --> 44:01.539
Son of a whore.

44:02.674 --> 44:05.076
Come on.

44:05.143 --> 44:07.278
Literally.

44:07.345 --> 44:10.181
His mother was killed
by one of her clients.

44:10.248 --> 44:13.384
Vengeance boils
in Harry Bosch's blood.

44:13.451 --> 44:15.353
It all gives me
the chills.

44:15.420 --> 44:18.356
But like any good villain,
Bosch sees this world

44:18.423 --> 44:21.927
through the narrow filter
of his broken childhood.

44:21.993 --> 44:24.229
He wants to save his mother.

44:24.295 --> 44:27.165
He wants to punish
her killer.

44:27.232 --> 44:30.535
He sees in me all
the things that roil him:

44:30.601 --> 44:33.538
success and sexuality

44:33.604 --> 44:38.343
and-- and a healthy disregard
for his tenuous authority.

44:38.409 --> 44:40.979
Are you thinking this
could be your next film?

44:44.615 --> 44:47.485
It's so trope-y.
Who'd believe it?

44:47.552 --> 44:48.987
I would.

44:50.455 --> 44:53.058
I don't think it's trope-y.

44:53.124 --> 44:55.426
You just want to be in it.

44:55.493 --> 44:58.429
As long as I don't
have to fuck the cop.

44:58.496 --> 45:00.298
Nah.

45:01.967 --> 45:04.002
He fucks himself.

47:15.366 --> 47:19.871
Beware, beware.

47:19.938 --> 47:22.440
God sees.

47:48.333 --> 47:49.534
Harry.
