00:00.965 --> 00:03.899
Welcome back to
the 70th Annual C.I.A. Awards,

00:03.901 --> 00:05.901
with your host, Nicki Minaj.

00:07.797 --> 00:09.738
When I was asked to host these awards,

00:09.850 --> 00:11.083
I was a little nervous.

00:11.085 --> 00:13.185
Maybe because I was thrown into a van

00:13.187 --> 00:15.354
and injected with mind-control drugs.

00:16.423 --> 00:20.559
Damn, this new Billy Crystal
has the juiciest ass.

00:20.561 --> 00:22.227
But as they kick in,

00:22.229 --> 00:24.363
it's becoming a night
of magical moments.

00:24.365 --> 00:28.867
We've seen Agent Jackson win
Best Wiretap Sound Mixing.

00:29.187 --> 00:30.636
Whoo, Jackson!

00:30.638 --> 00:33.372
And, of course,
Deputy Director Bullock's

00:33.374 --> 00:35.607
annual win for Best Chili.

00:37.812 --> 00:42.147
And the winner for Best
Undercover Agent is...

00:42.149 --> 00:44.216
Agent X.

00:47.555 --> 00:48.687
Wow!

00:48.689 --> 00:50.522
I didn't even prepare a speech.

00:50.524 --> 00:52.858
Felix, Isabella, you can go to bed now.

00:52.860 --> 00:55.227
Oh, God.
I said your names on television.

00:55.229 --> 00:57.196
Pack your bags. Get out of the house.

00:57.198 --> 00:59.031
Make sure you're not being followed!

00:59.033 --> 01:03.168
Daddy's bringing this to
the place we discussed!

01:05.706 --> 01:08.340

01:34.468 --> 01:38.937
And the award for Most
Elusive Villain goes to...

01:38.939 --> 01:41.640
Is everyone in position?

01:41.642 --> 01:42.941
The Falcon!

01:45.179 --> 01:46.778
This is the third time

01:46.780 --> 01:48.814
the Falcon has not fallen for this.

01:48.816 --> 01:51.283
And now, the only agent who refuses

01:51.285 --> 01:55.120
to wear a towel in the
C.I.A. locker room, Duper!

01:56.223 --> 01:59.124
The nominees for Best
Spy Seduction Are...

01:59.126 --> 02:02.494
Tyrese Gibson for "Senior Seduction."

02:07.935 --> 02:10.769
Dick Reynolds for "Dictator's Horse."

02:12.000 --> 02:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:22.483 --> 02:26.985
And Stan Smith for "Smokin'
Hot North Korean Super Spy."

02:26.987 --> 02:31.390
We simply must stop running
into each other like this.

02:31.392 --> 02:33.525
Red wine and everclear.

02:33.527 --> 02:35.027
You remembered.

02:35.029 --> 02:38.764
Or maybe I just forgot to forget.

02:48.375 --> 02:49.875
And the winner is...

02:49.877 --> 02:51.743
Stan Smith.

02:55.349 --> 02:57.482
Oh, there's so many people to thank.

02:57.484 --> 03:00.285
But I wouldn't be here
without my elementary school

03:00.287 --> 03:02.287
gym teacher, Mr. Raggins,

03:02.289 --> 03:04.389
who taught me everything
I know about seduction.

03:11.267 --> 03:12.933
After all these years,

03:12.935 --> 03:15.302
it turns out Stan Smith <i>can</i> be romantic!

03:15.304 --> 03:17.504
You seduced the crap out of that spy.

03:17.506 --> 03:18.348
No biggie.

03:18.348 --> 03:21.241
I just put hours of thought
into who she is as a person

03:21.243 --> 03:22.776
and what would make her truly happy,

03:22.778 --> 03:24.011
and then I gave it to her.

03:24.013 --> 03:27.014
Well, how about you give it to me?

03:27.016 --> 03:28.215
Pass.

03:29.752 --> 03:32.853
Sexy Stan is just an act
I put on for work.

03:32.855 --> 03:37.524
At home, you get the real me.

03:37.526 --> 03:39.826
This little sucker was
trying to make a run for it.

03:39.828 --> 03:42.229
The hell you do.

03:42.231 --> 03:44.473
Francine, I think
I feel a pimple on my back.

03:44.508 --> 03:45.132
Can you take a look?

03:45.134 --> 03:47.401
Can we do our gross stuff tomorrow?

03:47.403 --> 03:50.070
I'm still hoping to get
a little of that sexy,

03:50.072 --> 03:52.072
suave Stan I saw tonight.

03:52.074 --> 03:54.775
Hey, it's not like you're
hot and sexy 24/7 either.

03:54.777 --> 03:57.044
What about your nasty, jagged toenail

03:57.046 --> 03:59.012
that's always scratching
up my leg in bed?

03:59.014 --> 04:01.214
You ran over my foot with your car

04:01.216 --> 04:02.949
and it never grew back right!

04:02.951 --> 04:05.085
That was for a bit,
and it was hilarious.

04:05.087 --> 04:06.970
This is exactly my point.

04:07.005 --> 04:10.657
I bet you don't talk to Korean
spies about their toenails.

04:10.659 --> 04:12.326
Of course not. They're Korean.

04:12.328 --> 04:14.428
Well-manicured feet
are part of the deal.

04:14.430 --> 04:15.729
I'm going to bed,

04:15.731 --> 04:18.798
right after I just destroy the bathroom.

04:20.269 --> 04:22.869
Oh, Francine, you deserve better.

04:22.871 --> 04:25.238
Klaus? Were you hiding back there?

04:25.240 --> 04:27.974
Hiding? This is a normal bowl spot.

04:27.976 --> 04:31.111
Listen, the reason
Stan only romances spies

04:31.113 --> 04:33.980
is because spies have
something he needs,

04:33.982 --> 04:35.716
and you don't.

04:35.718 --> 04:37.551
That's not true. I have a...

04:37.553 --> 04:38.819
Vaginas don't count.

04:38.821 --> 04:40.120
They're, like, all over the place.

04:40.122 --> 04:41.922
Throw a rock, you'll hit three.

04:41.924 --> 04:43.824
Beep, beep, beep.

04:47.963 --> 04:50.130
Last night was a doozy.

04:50.132 --> 04:52.966
Woke up in a pool of blood
with my thumb up my ass.

04:52.968 --> 04:54.434
I think I'm sleeping wrong.

04:54.436 --> 04:58.071
And I brought Miss Nicki Minaj back here

04:58.073 --> 05:01.475
and had the squeakiest sex of my life.

05:04.346 --> 05:06.213
Or did I?

05:06.215 --> 05:07.314
Francine?

05:07.316 --> 05:09.783
Honey, I feel awful about last night.

05:09.785 --> 05:13.320
I know you can't be the same
guy at home as you are at work,

05:13.322 --> 05:19.126
so I came down to break me
off a piece of sexy work Stan.

05:19.128 --> 05:21.128
Right here, in front of everyone?

05:21.130 --> 05:24.364
Oh, I think they'll leave us
alone when they hear about

05:24.366 --> 05:27.434
the double fudge brownies
I left in the kitchen.

05:27.436 --> 05:30.404
I get your drift, you sly little minx.

05:30.406 --> 05:31.738
Attention, everyone!

05:31.740 --> 05:33.807
There's brownies in the kitchen!

05:33.809 --> 05:35.409
Follow me!

05:38.847 --> 05:41.248
God, I'm bored, but things will pick up

05:41.250 --> 05:42.616
as soon as the mail gets here.

05:42.618 --> 05:44.851
Oh, yeah. The mail's
going to be a game changer.

05:44.853 --> 05:46.653
I mean, it's the mail.

05:46.655 --> 05:48.455
The mail always delivers.

05:50.058 --> 05:52.526
Guess what! I'm into classic cars now.

05:52.528 --> 05:53.660
Screw the mail!

05:53.662 --> 05:54.861
Oh, yeah!

05:54.863 --> 05:56.596
That's right. I'm going to be one of

05:56.598 --> 05:59.065
those regal road dogs,
showing off his wheels

05:59.067 --> 06:01.234
in the Bob's Big Boy parking lot,

06:01.236 --> 06:02.235
a real PTHer.

06:02.237 --> 06:04.471
PTH stands for "Pop The Hood."

06:04.473 --> 06:06.940
We have our own lingo, us car-heads.

06:06.942 --> 06:08.942
"Car-heads" meaning "car likers."

06:08.944 --> 06:10.610
Roger, this is so cool.

06:10.612 --> 06:11.778
How'd you get into it?

06:11.780 --> 06:13.713
Well, if you must know...

06:13.715 --> 06:16.349
I was wheelbarrowing home
from the liquor store

06:16.351 --> 06:18.251
when I happened upon a vintage Mustang.

06:18.253 --> 06:20.320
Now, normally,
I couldn't care less about

06:20.322 --> 06:23.457
some old hunk of junk,
but something happened,

06:23.459 --> 06:27.294
something truly amazing.

06:27.296 --> 06:30.764
I mean, what's better than a
thumbs-up from a mustache guy?

06:30.766 --> 06:33.834
I don't know, two mustache guys
giving you a thumbs-up?

06:33.836 --> 06:35.202
Oh, no. You don't want that. Trust me.

06:35.204 --> 06:36.937
The answer is nothing.

06:36.939 --> 06:38.338
Nothing is better.

06:38.340 --> 06:40.507
And if toolin' around in some old car

06:40.509 --> 06:43.643
is my ticket to Thumb Town,
then vroom, vroom, baby!

06:43.645 --> 06:46.646
"Vroom, vroom."
I like the sound of that.

06:46.648 --> 06:48.381
How do we get involved?

06:48.383 --> 06:51.251
It's Classic Cruisers night
down at the Triple B...

06:51.253 --> 06:52.819
Bob's Big Boy. More lingo.

06:52.821 --> 06:55.589
So, how about we buff another
coat of sparkle on this baby

06:55.591 --> 06:57.891
and go get thumbed by a mustache guy?

06:57.893 --> 06:58.892
Vroom, vroom!

06:58.894 --> 07:00.494
Oh, yeah!

07:04.867 --> 07:07.467
Oh, my God. We're so bad.

07:07.469 --> 07:08.969
At eating.

07:08.971 --> 07:11.238
Sir, a thumb drive
with the identities of half

07:11.240 --> 07:13.406
our undercover agents
around the world was stolen

07:13.408 --> 07:14.975
during our brownie break!

07:14.977 --> 07:17.310
Well, those agents knew the risks.

07:17.312 --> 07:19.980
The drive also had a copy
of your secret chili recipe.

07:19.982 --> 07:22.182
Aaaah!

07:22.184 --> 07:24.518
We must stop at nothing
to get that drive back.

07:24.520 --> 07:27.287
Nothing! But who could have stolen it?

07:27.289 --> 07:29.856
The Jackal? The Falcon? Who?

07:31.426 --> 07:33.059
The Beaver.

07:33.061 --> 07:35.862
Sorry, Francine,
are you talking to somebody?

07:35.864 --> 07:37.297
I'm not Francine.

07:37.299 --> 07:41.301
I'm a hot-ass super spy
with stolen C.I.A. secrets.

07:42.504 --> 07:43.870
The Beaver.

07:43.872 --> 07:46.573
Oh, I want a cool spy name.

07:46.575 --> 07:47.741
I will be...

07:48.844 --> 07:50.043
The Beaver.

07:50.045 --> 07:52.078
Hold on. That's my name.

07:52.080 --> 07:52.899
No way!

07:53.092 --> 07:56.983
We came up with the same spy
name at the exact same time.

08:00.461 --> 08:01.761
You were right, Klaus.

08:01.763 --> 08:04.046
I didn't have anything Stan needs.

08:04.046 --> 08:05.364
But now I do.

08:05.366 --> 08:08.134
Or should I say the Beaver does?

08:08.136 --> 08:10.035
And once the C.I.A. realizes

08:10.037 --> 08:12.338
a lady spy has their thumb drive,

08:12.340 --> 08:15.074
they'll send Stan to
romance it away from her.

08:15.076 --> 08:17.343
And "her" is me!

08:17.345 --> 08:21.013
So it's me who's getting
romanced by Stan,

08:21.015 --> 08:23.482
because I have something he needs!

08:23.484 --> 08:25.217
Yeah, I got it like five words in.

08:25.219 --> 08:26.552
It's not that complicated.

08:26.554 --> 08:30.089
Now I just need a website
for the C.I.A. to find

08:30.091 --> 08:33.458
advertising that the drive
is for sale to terrorists.

08:33.461 --> 08:34.460
I can make it!

08:34.462 --> 08:36.361
I bleed HTML!

08:37.865 --> 08:41.967
Okay, let's set this baby up
with a CSS on the back end,

08:41.969 --> 08:44.135
tweak the G.U.I., enable JavaScript,

08:44.138 --> 08:48.741
register the site at geocities.com,
and... voilÃ .

08:48.743 --> 08:51.110
Klaus! It's breathtaking!

08:51.112 --> 08:52.645
Hold on, hold on.

08:52.647 --> 08:55.381
The cherry on top.

09:11.232 --> 09:14.533
And it can't be turned off.

09:17.205 --> 09:19.371
Sure, the outside looks clean,

09:19.373 --> 09:22.007
but what about the engine?

09:23.377 --> 09:26.478
Hmm, it's so clean,
I can eat an egg off it.

09:32.386 --> 09:36.155
I declare this vintage
automobile perfectly restored.

09:36.157 --> 09:39.658
Roger, look... a mustache man!

09:41.295 --> 09:42.561
He's giving you a thumbs-up!

09:42.563 --> 09:45.664
And he's got the bacon for your eggs!

09:45.666 --> 09:47.333
Shh.

09:47.335 --> 09:49.401
Shut the [bleep] up, Steve.

09:52.106 --> 09:54.240
Is that Jay Leno?

09:54.242 --> 09:57.309
Yep. Classic cars are
the perfect Leno bait.

09:57.311 --> 10:00.779
See, this wasn't about Bob's Big Boy
mustache rides or whatever.

10:00.781 --> 10:03.015
It's about revenge.

10:05.620 --> 10:08.854
Wow, Roger's gotten a lot of use
out of that dog-catcher pole.

10:08.856 --> 10:10.623
Great purchase.

10:13.878 --> 10:15.394
Guys, I have a Google alert

10:15.396 --> 10:18.130
for the word "spies,"
and a new site just went up.

10:18.132 --> 10:19.999
- Ooh! Sparkly!
- _

10:20.001 --> 10:21.433
- High tech!
- _

10:21.435 --> 10:25.271
This Beaver claims to
be a hot-ass super spy

10:25.273 --> 10:27.606
selling a stolen C.I.A. thumb drive.

10:27.608 --> 10:29.375
How are we going to get that drive back?

10:29.377 --> 10:31.343
We're not going to do anything.

10:31.345 --> 10:33.045
We'll send in our heartbreaker.

10:33.047 --> 10:34.980
Smith, get to work.

10:34.982 --> 10:36.415
Right away, sir.

10:39.053 --> 10:40.686
_

10:40.688 --> 10:41.720
- Oop!
- _

10:43.369 --> 10:44.127
_

10:44.492 --> 10:47.359
Ooh! Stan's in the chat room.

10:47.361 --> 10:48.661
"Hello, stranger.

10:48.663 --> 10:51.063
Welcome to the Beaver's Dam."

10:51.065 --> 10:52.398
Watch out, boys.

10:52.400 --> 10:54.566
Things are about to get charming.

10:54.568 --> 10:57.436
"Miss Beaver, I understand you have

10:57.438 --> 11:00.306
a hot item you're looking to share."

11:02.610 --> 11:04.109
Winky face.

11:04.111 --> 11:05.644
A keyboard Casanova.

11:05.646 --> 11:06.679
Ahh!

11:06.681 --> 11:09.515
"A lot of men want my hot item.

11:09.517 --> 11:11.583
Why should I give it to you?"

11:11.585 --> 11:14.053
"You give me your thumb drive

11:14.055 --> 11:16.889
and I'll give you my 6-inch floppy."

11:16.891 --> 11:18.557
My God. This is so erotic.

11:18.559 --> 11:21.961
I know. Stan's finally seducing me.

11:21.963 --> 11:24.563
Although I never pictured
you being part of it.

11:24.565 --> 11:26.899
Funny, it's the only way I pictured it.

12:01.569 --> 12:04.303
"There's a masquerade ball on Friday.

12:04.305 --> 12:08.374
Be dressed in red and we'll
make a little exchange."

12:08.376 --> 12:12.378
"I was hoping for more
of a big exchange."

12:12.380 --> 12:15.547
"How about an average-sized exchange

12:15.549 --> 12:17.883
from a very attentive exchanger,

12:17.885 --> 12:22.888
one with the stamina for
up to two exchanges?"

12:25.092 --> 12:28.460
Roger, this cage is supposed
to be for the whole family,

12:28.462 --> 12:30.295
but you're always the one using it.

12:30.297 --> 12:32.798
And why exactly did you need to capture

12:32.800 --> 12:34.166
a retired talk-show host?

12:36.537 --> 12:38.137
Simple. I was flipping through

12:38.139 --> 12:40.806
my revenge book the other day
and saw his name in there.

12:40.808 --> 12:41.907
Whoa!

12:41.909 --> 12:43.442
What did Jay Leno do to you?

12:43.444 --> 12:45.477
Oh, I'll tell you what he did.

12:46.214 --> 12:48.247
The year was 1978

12:48.249 --> 12:50.649
and I had a weekly spot
at the Comedy Store.

12:50.651 --> 12:52.851
I was an angry comic, very political,

12:52.853 --> 12:55.554
driven beyond all
reason to shock people,

12:55.556 --> 12:58.824
and in the audience one
night was a young Jay Leno.

12:58.826 --> 13:02.161
Oh, my God! Leno stole your jokes?

13:02.163 --> 13:03.629
Yeah, no, now that I think of it,

13:03.631 --> 13:06.732
he was actually just
giving me helpful feedback.

13:06.734 --> 13:09.601
I had a 10-minute bit about
poisoning Jimmy Carter

13:09.603 --> 13:12.104
and Jay suggested I talk
about how airplane food

13:12.106 --> 13:13.472
doesn't taste good instead.

13:13.474 --> 13:16.275
That eventually led to
my famous train-food bit

13:16.277 --> 13:17.743
which got me kicked off "Star Search"

13:17.745 --> 13:20.312
because it was too racist.

13:20.314 --> 13:22.748
So Jay Leno didn't do
anything wrong to you.

13:22.750 --> 13:24.817
He's in the revenge book, Hayley.

13:24.819 --> 13:26.652
That means he did
something that is worthy

13:26.654 --> 13:29.154
of taking revenge upon, Hayley.

13:29.156 --> 13:31.390
Wonder what it was.

13:31.392 --> 13:33.492
So, Jay, do you ever get nervous

13:33.494 --> 13:36.462
that you're going to make a joke
and nobody's going to laugh?

13:37.731 --> 13:39.398
Come on, comic to comic.

13:40.801 --> 13:42.868
Shut up! How dare you distract me

13:42.870 --> 13:45.170
from trying to remember why I hate you.

13:55.382 --> 13:57.449
Well, well, well.

13:57.451 --> 13:59.618
If it isn't... Francine?!

13:59.620 --> 14:01.086
What the hell are you doing here?!

14:01.088 --> 14:02.955
Who's Francine Smith?

14:02.957 --> 14:04.056
I'm...

14:05.693 --> 14:06.725
The Beaver.

14:06.727 --> 14:08.861
First off, that's Klaus' spy name.

14:08.863 --> 14:10.629
And second, what the hell are you doing

14:10.631 --> 14:12.531
stealing classified national secrets?

14:12.533 --> 14:15.801
I wanted you to seduce me,
like you do your spies.

14:15.803 --> 14:17.603
When I do that, it's an act.

14:17.605 --> 14:18.971
What we have is real.

14:18.973 --> 14:20.506
It's the everyday stuff.

14:20.508 --> 14:22.808
It's eating Bagel Bites
while watching "Shark Tank"

14:22.810 --> 14:24.309
until one of us falls asleep.

14:24.311 --> 14:26.044
Now give me that drive.

14:26.046 --> 14:27.513
Fine.

14:27.515 --> 14:29.214
My purse! It's gone!

14:29.216 --> 14:31.917
And the drive's inside it!

14:31.919 --> 14:33.318
It's the Falcon!

14:35.857 --> 14:38.257
Hurry! Get the valet to bring your car

14:38.259 --> 14:39.291
and we'll chase him!

14:39.293 --> 14:41.059
I-I didn't valet.

14:41.061 --> 14:42.729
You know it's free, Stan.

14:42.764 --> 14:44.396
But you've still got to tip him.

14:44.398 --> 14:46.832
Maybe I should have married the Falcon.

14:49.606 --> 14:51.039
Damn it, Francine!

14:51.041 --> 14:52.874
The Falcon could be anywhere
with that thumb drive.

14:52.876 --> 14:54.910
The C.I.A. has no way to find him.

14:54.912 --> 14:57.946
I'm sorry, Stan, but if the C.I.A.

14:57.948 --> 15:00.515
can't get to him, maybe you need to...

15:00.517 --> 15:02.484
leave it to the Beaver.

15:02.486 --> 15:04.219
The show's called "Leave It to Beaver."

15:04.221 --> 15:06.655
If you're adding words
to make it work, abandon ship.

15:06.657 --> 15:09.424
Listen, he knew I'd be
at the masquerade ball.

15:09.426 --> 15:11.437
He must have been
monitoring my chat room.

15:11.437 --> 15:13.562
Let's see if he still is.

15:13.564 --> 15:17.499
"Well-played, Falcon,
but I have even better

15:17.501 --> 15:21.203
C.I.A. info than what
was on that drive."

15:21.205 --> 15:23.071
The trap is set.

15:23.073 --> 15:25.240
I guess we've got some
time on our hands.

15:25.242 --> 15:28.643
How much you want to bet me
I can fit inside the wall?

15:34.451 --> 15:36.685
You owe me 10 bucks.

15:37.493 --> 15:38.653
No sleeping!

15:38.655 --> 15:42.424
I will remember what you did to me.

15:42.426 --> 15:44.126
I think I know.

15:46.463 --> 15:48.597
Good question. Hmm.

15:48.599 --> 15:50.665
Who <i>is</i> the current vice president?

15:50.667 --> 15:53.201
Oh! "Stone Cold" Steve Austin!

15:54.972 --> 15:56.671
You know what? Screw you!

15:56.673 --> 15:58.206
People are stupid? That's your joke?

15:58.208 --> 16:00.942
That the average Joes
you've spent decades

16:00.944 --> 16:02.544
pandering to are idiots?

16:02.546 --> 16:06.148
Well, we're not. That's a stereostripe!

16:09.620 --> 16:10.886
And there you have it,

16:10.888 --> 16:13.088
the reason you want revenge on Jay Leno.

16:13.090 --> 16:15.056
Actually, as humiliating as that was,

16:15.058 --> 16:17.359
a casting agent saw it
and booked me a role

16:17.361 --> 16:18.827
on "NCIS: L.A."

16:18.829 --> 16:23.098
It was huge for my career,
just... just huge.

16:25.769 --> 16:27.669
Freeze! NCIS L.A.!

16:27.671 --> 16:30.238
NCIS L.A.! Hands in the air!

16:33.744 --> 16:36.511
Only in NCIS: L.A.

16:37.614 --> 16:38.680
Stan!

16:38.682 --> 16:40.582
The Falcon replied!

16:40.584 --> 16:43.385
"Beaver, I want to buy new secrets.

16:43.387 --> 16:47.122
Meet me at casino to discuss.

16:47.124 --> 16:48.757
I send address."

16:48.759 --> 16:50.826
Well, pack your bags, Beaver.

16:50.828 --> 16:53.328
Looks like we're going on a mission.

16:53.330 --> 16:55.230
Huh. I'm only at the stairs?

16:55.232 --> 16:57.132
I thought I made it to the kitchen.

17:06.561 --> 17:08.910
I told you, you're way over-dressed
for Atlantic City.

17:08.912 --> 17:10.545
Now, let's get that drive back.

17:10.547 --> 17:12.513
He's not just going to give it to us.

17:12.516 --> 17:14.215
That's why you're going to seduce him

17:14.218 --> 17:15.650
and get him up to the hotel room

17:15.652 --> 17:17.117
where I'll be waiting.

17:17.119 --> 17:18.553
Sexy spy fun!

17:18.555 --> 17:20.288
No. Life-and-death work.

17:20.290 --> 17:21.923
And there's our man.

17:25.061 --> 17:28.496
I believe we have business
to discuss, Mr. Falcon.

17:28.498 --> 17:30.599
Shall we adjourn to my room?

17:30.601 --> 17:33.635
You expect me to go
upstairs with a stranger?

17:35.739 --> 17:37.706
I am more careful than that.

17:37.708 --> 17:40.542
Before I go with you, I must know...

17:40.544 --> 17:44.279
Is the inspection certificate
in the elevator up to date?

17:47.284 --> 17:49.784
Sorry to make it a whole big thing,

17:49.786 --> 17:52.087
but I just don't trust elevators

17:52.089 --> 17:57.626
when sign says "certificate on file
at front desk."

17:59.096 --> 18:01.029
Okay, guys? This is funny.

18:01.031 --> 18:03.798
This is really, really funny,
like, classic me.

18:03.800 --> 18:06.601
Turns out this isn't
my revenge book at all!

18:06.603 --> 18:08.003
It's my autograph book!

18:08.005 --> 18:11.506
And to think I chemically blinded
Michael Chiklis for nothing!

18:11.508 --> 18:13.375
So if Leno didn't do anything wrong,

18:13.377 --> 18:14.743
can we let him go now?

18:14.745 --> 18:16.244
Uh, yeah, Steve.

18:16.246 --> 18:18.079
Is he always like this?

18:19.316 --> 18:22.817
Okay, who was in charge of feeding him?

18:22.819 --> 18:24.419
Guys, come on.

18:24.421 --> 18:27.589
Let's not let Jay Leno
ruin yet another night.

18:27.591 --> 18:29.658
Well, I'll be.

18:29.660 --> 18:32.093
Eyes to the right, kids.

18:35.365 --> 18:36.431
Huh.

18:36.433 --> 18:37.933
That does feel kind of good.

18:37.935 --> 18:39.968
Maybe we should have done
the classic car thing.

18:39.970 --> 18:42.270
Oh, well. Live and learn.

18:45.628 --> 18:47.755
_

18:47.778 --> 18:51.413
Here we are, all alone in my room.

18:51.415 --> 18:52.781
Oh, God!

18:52.783 --> 18:54.983
Tell your partner to
throw out his weapon

18:54.985 --> 18:57.385
and come out with his hands up.

18:57.387 --> 18:58.653
Stan, he's got a gun!

18:58.655 --> 19:01.356
This isn't fun anymore!

19:01.358 --> 19:03.625
Okay, Falcon, you've got my gun.

19:03.627 --> 19:05.226
How about sliding me a magazine?

19:05.228 --> 19:06.995
I'm in the middle of a monster D here

19:06.997 --> 19:09.497
and I'm tired of reading
this shampoo bottle.

19:10.867 --> 19:13.034
This is all my fault, Stan.

19:13.036 --> 19:16.538
I got obsessed with
you as this sexy spy.

19:16.540 --> 19:17.973
But I get it now.

19:17.975 --> 19:20.475
It's work and it's terrifying,

19:20.477 --> 19:24.045
and I understand why you
don't want to bring it home.

19:24.047 --> 19:25.814
It's my fault too, baby.

19:25.816 --> 19:27.682
I'm sorry, but I understand now.

19:27.684 --> 19:31.453
Even ordinary women deserve to
feel special from time to time.

19:31.455 --> 19:34.923
Well, right now,
I'd give anything to be home

19:34.925 --> 19:38.259
in sweatpants with the
regular old Stan I know.

19:38.261 --> 19:39.494
That's it!

19:39.496 --> 19:41.396
We know every little
detail about each other,

19:41.398 --> 19:45.633
like that you haven't filed down
that jagged toenail in weeks.

19:48.305 --> 19:50.939
What in the hell are you two...

19:50.941 --> 19:52.674
Ew! Why you do that?

19:52.676 --> 19:54.943
It's so gross! I can't look!

19:54.945 --> 19:57.379
Stan, your toothpick!

19:57.381 --> 19:58.380
Hyah!

19:58.382 --> 20:01.383
Aaaaaaah!

20:01.385 --> 20:04.252
That's what you get for
"picking" a fight

20:04.254 --> 20:05.820
with the C.I.A.

20:10.160 --> 20:13.728
And the winner of Best
Couples Kill is...

20:13.730 --> 20:16.498
Stan and Francine Smith!

20:16.500 --> 20:18.400
_

20:18.402 --> 20:20.535
_

20:20.537 --> 20:24.072
We simply must stop
running into each other like this.

20:34.284 --> 20:36.217
- Mmm!
- Mmm!

20:36.219 --> 20:38.186
Oh, Stan.

20:38.188 --> 20:40.955
I love it when you're romantic.

20:40.957 --> 20:45.260
And I love it when you
taste like Bagel Bites.
