00:33.283 --> 00:34.409
Value Maids!

00:36.661 --> 00:37.787
Value Maids!

00:49.007 --> 00:51.092
Value Maids! Hello!

00:54.888 --> 00:57.265
Of course I'm at work.
I show up to work on time.

00:57.348 --> 00:58.516
Which girl is this?

00:58.600 --> 01:01.853
Alex. 3450 Ardmore.

01:02.604 --> 01:05.273
Okay, keep your pants on.
I'll check my phone.

01:10.153 --> 01:13.490
Yep. She forgot we were coming.
Happens sometimes.

01:13.573 --> 01:15.742
Okay, well, is she gonna pay me for today?

01:16.201 --> 01:18.828
Why would she do that?
She ain't getting her house cleaned.

01:18.912 --> 01:21.331
You're not returning my Dyson
like that, are you?

01:21.414 --> 01:24.584
Yolanda, I can't afford
to get stiffed today. I can't.

01:24.667 --> 01:26.169
Showing up for this cost me

01:26.252 --> 01:28.463
because I had to pay for gas,
and for daycare.

01:28.546 --> 01:31.633
-I'm not taking a loss on today.
-Calm your tits.

01:31.716 --> 01:33.051
Let me see what I got.

01:34.844 --> 01:35.678
All right.

01:35.762 --> 01:38.681
19 Glastonbury, 12 noon.

01:38.765 --> 01:41.351
That's Catalina's clean, but that girl
don't wanna work.

01:41.434 --> 01:42.268
Great.

01:42.852 --> 01:44.687
Wait. Never mind.

01:44.771 --> 01:47.816
That's a five-hour clean.
That's gonna take you over your 30 hours.

01:49.150 --> 01:50.735
So put me over 30 hours.

01:50.819 --> 01:53.863
-No, you know the rules.
-So let me get this straight.

01:53.947 --> 01:56.324
You cap us at 30 hours,
but if a client stands us up,

01:56.407 --> 01:59.661
you're not gonna compensate us
for the time and money that we've wasted?

02:00.161 --> 02:01.704
Sorry. Rules are rules.

02:02.205 --> 02:05.875
Yolanda, this is bullshit! I showed up
for work and you owe me work. Fuck!

02:06.584 --> 02:08.795
-Okay. Thanks for calling, mama.

02:57.760 --> 02:59.012
Hi, can I help you?

02:59.095 --> 03:02.891
Hi, ma'am, I can see that you're on
your way out, so I'm gonna be super quick.

03:03.766 --> 03:05.935
You use Value Maids
cleaning service, right?

03:06.019 --> 03:08.021
Yeah, they're coming this afternoon. Why?

03:08.104 --> 03:10.899
My name is Alex, and I would
like to clean your house instead.

03:11.691 --> 03:14.194
-Yeah, no thanks.
-I'll do it for $10 an hour, cash.

03:15.820 --> 03:18.031
-What's the catch?
-No catch.

03:18.531 --> 03:20.825
You get a much better clean
at a much cheaper rate,

03:20.909 --> 03:22.785
and I'm gonna get some cash in hand.

03:22.869 --> 03:25.997
Just call Value Maids, cancel your clean,
and I'll start right away.

03:27.874 --> 03:29.876
-Okay.
-Thank you.

03:34.172 --> 03:37.258
The owners of 19 Glastonbury
were a married couple

03:37.342 --> 03:39.844
who lived completely separate lives.

03:40.511 --> 03:41.971
Their food was separate.

03:42.764 --> 03:44.682
Their linens were separate.

03:46.809 --> 03:48.102
Separate shoes.

03:48.937 --> 03:50.230
Separate chairs.

03:52.857 --> 03:54.901
Even their bedrooms were separate.

03:56.778 --> 03:58.988
With separate sex drawers.

03:59.530 --> 04:04.285
His with his porn magazines full
of hairless vaginas and fake tits.

04:05.245 --> 04:08.915
Hers with her romance novels
about cowboys.

04:09.916 --> 04:11.334
Shirtless cowboys.

04:12.543 --> 04:17.840
Shirtless on a horse, shirtless
in a storm, shirtless by a cactus.

04:22.220 --> 04:26.182
Marriage was an armistice
between two dueling parties in this house.

04:26.849 --> 04:31.020
Each hiding behind their walls.
Each dreaming of someone else.

05:03.720 --> 05:05.972
Hey. You don't have to knock.

05:06.472 --> 05:07.432
Okay.

05:08.182 --> 05:11.019
Do you want some coffee?
I just made a fresh pot.

05:11.519 --> 05:13.980
-I'm gonna be in and out.
-Okay.

05:16.858 --> 05:18.526
What are you looking for?

05:19.027 --> 05:23.823
There's a folder my mom said she gave me
with her bank and mortgage papers in it.

05:23.906 --> 05:27.869
What do you need that for?
Something wrong with your mom's house?

05:28.995 --> 05:31.414
Yes. There's tenants
that are paying rent to Basil,

05:31.497 --> 05:34.292
and I can't kick them out
without proof that she owns it.

05:34.375 --> 05:36.836
-Can I help?
-Oh, you wanna help me, Sean?

05:38.296 --> 05:40.631
Yeah. I do. And-- I'm sorry.

05:40.715 --> 05:43.217
I don't know how many times
I have to apologize.

05:43.301 --> 05:45.386
I lost my apartment because of you.

05:49.140 --> 05:49.974
I know.

05:50.767 --> 05:53.394
It was a slip. Okay? It happens.

05:53.936 --> 05:58.441
-I was in a meeting later that same day.
-I was homeless later that same day.

05:58.524 --> 06:01.069
-And this time, my mom was too.
-I meant what I said.

06:01.569 --> 06:03.696
You take the trailer.
I'll sleep in the car.

06:03.780 --> 06:05.490
I will never live here again.

06:08.409 --> 06:11.037
Alex, can you stop a minute? Hmm?

06:11.120 --> 06:12.580
Hey, can we talk?

06:13.998 --> 06:16.459
I worked so hard
to get a Fisher Island address,

06:16.542 --> 06:18.795
so that Maddy could go to that preschool.

06:18.878 --> 06:20.963
We almost lost everything because of you.

06:21.047 --> 06:23.966
I'm sure that Nate was eager
to stick his address on your forms.

06:24.050 --> 06:26.719
-Okay.
-I don't want her living with that guy.

06:26.803 --> 06:30.390
-It's gonna confuse her.
-About what a nice guy acts like?

06:31.557 --> 06:35.103
You know, you wanted me sober.
Well, this is me sober, baby!

06:35.186 --> 06:38.523
I'm a fucked-up person,
and it's gonna be messy,

06:38.606 --> 06:40.983
but I'm doing this for you and Maddy.

06:41.067 --> 06:43.611
-I should not have broken...
-Just do it for Maddy.

06:43.694 --> 06:47.073
...into that house looking for you,
but I was looking for you.

06:47.156 --> 06:48.574
-Okay.
-Alex!

06:48.658 --> 06:52.912
-Look, I can't do this without you.
-Stop, just stop. Stop! Stop!

06:53.955 --> 06:56.332
Okay? Otherwise, what's the fucking point?

06:56.999 --> 07:01.254
You're the only person that really
knows me, that knows what I come from.

07:02.088 --> 07:04.048
Okay? That's why we work!

07:04.757 --> 07:05.591
Alex!

07:06.884 --> 07:08.845
-That's why we work. Okay?
-Stop.

07:08.928 --> 07:10.972
-I'm leaving.
-We're damaged the same way.

07:11.055 --> 07:12.056
We're family!

07:39.959 --> 07:41.919
All right, Mom, let's do this.

07:42.003 --> 07:42.837
Mm.

07:43.713 --> 07:46.549
Give me a second.
These places make me nauseous.

07:47.508 --> 07:48.551
Mm.

07:49.760 --> 07:50.970
I think you're good.

07:51.053 --> 07:54.307
How did a daughter of mine
end up so square?

07:54.390 --> 07:56.350
You're basically a trapezoid.

07:57.059 --> 08:00.771
-A trapezoid is not a square.
-Only a square would know that.

08:01.314 --> 08:04.984
This is a Chinese food menu.

08:05.610 --> 08:07.111
I am sorry about that.

08:08.446 --> 08:11.491
This is a lab report.

08:13.075 --> 08:14.076
Urinalysis.

08:16.287 --> 08:18.372
You said this was your bank
and important documents.

08:19.123 --> 08:22.960
I think... this is a different folder.

08:25.796 --> 08:29.926
I've got an acceptance letter
from Montana College of Fine Arts here.

08:31.344 --> 08:34.555
-You kept my acceptance letter?
-I'm your mother.

08:35.348 --> 08:37.892
You were gonna be the first Langley
to go to college.

08:45.149 --> 08:49.070
I'm sorry. There's nothing in here
pertaining to a mortgage.

08:49.153 --> 08:52.990
Uh, she's refinanced her house
probably 40 times.

08:53.074 --> 08:55.952
Is there any way that you could
just look her up in your system?

08:56.035 --> 08:58.538
Do you have a license
or state-issued ID, Miss Langley?

08:59.038 --> 08:59.872
Nope.

09:01.457 --> 09:03.376
-No license?
-They pull you over.

09:03.459 --> 09:05.628
They look you up in that machine.

09:05.711 --> 09:06.546
No.

09:07.547 --> 09:08.381
No.

09:08.965 --> 09:12.051
How about a passport?
A social security card?

09:13.469 --> 09:14.595
Birth certificate?

09:14.679 --> 09:19.433
Her wallet and most of her stuff
is actually in an RV with her husband,

09:19.517 --> 09:20.851
and he's gone missing.

09:20.935 --> 09:24.939
He's just blowing off some steam.
He'll be back in a few days.

09:25.022 --> 09:27.942
We just need to get a copy
of her mortgage so that we can prove

09:28.025 --> 09:30.653
to the tenants in her house
that she owns her house.

09:31.654 --> 09:33.531
Could you please help us out with that?

09:33.614 --> 09:37.243
Without identification,
I can't really do anything.

09:38.786 --> 09:44.333
Okay, listen up here, um, Sin... Singe...

09:44.417 --> 09:45.251
I'm sorry.

09:46.961 --> 09:47.795
Singh.

09:47.878 --> 09:49.964
-Singh! Hmm.
-Yeah.

09:50.715 --> 09:55.845
You know, I think we can both agree
that I'm a real person sitting here.

09:55.928 --> 09:59.849
I've got real skin and real hair and...

10:01.017 --> 10:05.062
I don't wanna embarrass you,
but these babies are real.

10:06.647 --> 10:10.610
I think you can vouch for my identity,

10:10.693 --> 10:14.739
and, you know, just type
into your little screen over there

10:15.531 --> 10:17.867
and pull my mortgage up.

10:17.950 --> 10:19.493
Can't you, sweetheart?

10:21.829 --> 10:22.872
Hmm.

10:23.456 --> 10:27.752
-Last four digits of your social?
-Attaboy. 5382. Whoo!

10:31.547 --> 10:34.258
-Are you sure your mortgage is with us?
-Yes.

10:35.343 --> 10:37.345
-What bank is this?
-JSMB.

10:40.306 --> 10:42.433
Sorry, this is not my bank!

10:43.934 --> 10:46.812
Oh, Singhy, baby,
you sure are a sweetheart.

10:46.896 --> 10:48.606
Thank you for your help.

10:48.689 --> 10:50.358
You have a good day!

10:50.441 --> 10:51.359
You too.

10:53.778 --> 10:59.241
You act like it's my fault
that all my shit's in Basil's RV.

11:00.117 --> 11:01.327
It is your fault.

11:01.410 --> 11:04.872
You married an idiot that rented your
house out and now we can't live in it.

11:08.042 --> 11:12.046
Well, I'll deal with it when he gets back.

11:13.047 --> 11:15.925
He's not coming back, Mom.
Will you button up?

11:16.967 --> 11:18.969
You know what sucks? It's your attitude.

11:19.053 --> 11:22.181
I mean, look at this amazing house
that we get to live in.

11:22.264 --> 11:24.934
We don't live here.
We're crashing here for a few days max.

11:25.017 --> 11:25.935
Welcome home!

11:26.018 --> 11:28.020
Hi! Sorry I'm late.

11:28.104 --> 11:29.271
We're in here!

11:30.439 --> 11:32.233
Look, Mommy. Pie.

11:33.025 --> 11:33.984
Wow.

11:34.819 --> 11:37.988
This looks amazing.
Is this shepherd's pie?

11:38.072 --> 11:39.031
Yeah.

11:39.573 --> 11:41.575
Mm. Smells fabulous.

11:42.159 --> 11:43.786
-Is this homemade?
-Yeah.

11:43.869 --> 11:46.455
I cook on Sundays
and just freeze it for the week.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.624
Throw it in after work, easy-peasy.

11:49.208 --> 11:51.794
Incredible. Thank you
for picking her up, by the way.

11:51.877 --> 11:56.424
Absolutely, I was already picking up
Brady, right? Sit. I'll make you a plate.

12:00.094 --> 12:01.053
Salad?

12:01.137 --> 12:02.221
Yes, please.

12:09.353 --> 12:13.399
I didn't wanna dress it yet because
I didn't want it to be wet.

12:14.024 --> 12:15.985
-Do you like your salad wet?
-Yes.

12:16.902 --> 12:19.989
This stuff is the best. Want some?

12:20.072 --> 12:22.992
You know, balsamic vinaigrettes
are too vinegar-y.

12:23.075 --> 12:26.328
But this one's just got
the perfect balance. I made it myself.

12:27.037 --> 12:29.331
-Thanks.
-And I was thinking.

12:29.415 --> 12:31.584
-Maybe tomorrow we'd do...

12:32.918 --> 12:34.378
A baked potato bar?

12:35.796 --> 12:39.759
-Pick your own toppings.
-Well, I've got to get back to work.

12:39.842 --> 12:43.471
I'm doing something truly extraordinary
back there, Nathaniel,

12:43.554 --> 12:47.308
and your garage
is taking my brush so well.

12:47.391 --> 12:49.018
What are you doing to his garage?

12:49.101 --> 12:51.312
I've been asked to paint a mural.

12:52.855 --> 12:54.648
Uh, you're aware of this?

12:54.732 --> 12:56.734
Yeah. She was looking for something to do.

12:56.817 --> 13:00.237
I figured, sure, make the back
of the garage more cheerful.

13:00.821 --> 13:01.906
Cheerful adjacent.

13:02.990 --> 13:08.329
Right, I mean, we're just honored
to have a real-life artist with us here,

13:08.412 --> 13:09.538
aren't we, Brady?

13:09.622 --> 13:10.456
Yeah?

13:10.539 --> 13:14.877
You are a real gem, Nathaniel.

13:15.461 --> 13:20.508
Like alexandrite, which makes
a diamond look like a trash can.

13:21.300 --> 13:24.470
-Yes. Oh-- Okay, thank you, Paula.
-Mm.

13:24.553 --> 13:26.013
Hey, Mom.

13:26.889 --> 13:27.973
Mm-mm.

13:30.309 --> 13:34.021
The Porn House couple live
separate lives in separate rooms.

13:34.980 --> 13:37.233
But they must have shared a life once.

13:43.948 --> 13:47.660
Perhaps one of them got hurt.
Perhaps they hurt each other.

13:48.828 --> 13:54.291
But something brought them together.
Now they sleep behind closed doors.

13:54.375 --> 13:58.087
Each too afraid to admit that what would
make them happy is in the room next door.

13:58.170 --> 13:59.004
Maddy down?

14:01.257 --> 14:03.050
Yep. Brady down?

14:04.218 --> 14:05.177
With a fight.

14:06.262 --> 14:07.596
Uh, can I get you a beer?

14:08.597 --> 14:12.017
There's plenty more in your fridge
that you paid for.

14:12.935 --> 14:16.772
Yeah, no, I can't drink after 8.
It messes with my stomach.

14:18.482 --> 14:19.316
Okay.

14:20.234 --> 14:22.653
Um, how about a glass of water?

14:22.736 --> 14:24.238
Yeah, sure. Thanks.

14:27.741 --> 14:32.079
Hey, do you think that Maddy might
wanna go to the stables?

14:32.162 --> 14:36.041
Brady and I will visit our pony tomorrow,
and I could take her after preschool.

14:36.959 --> 14:38.127
You have a pony?

14:38.794 --> 14:39.628
I do.

14:40.671 --> 14:41.672
String Cheese.

14:42.256 --> 14:43.424
Brady named her.

14:44.008 --> 14:45.885
She's an ancient Shetland Bay.

14:50.806 --> 14:51.724
Um...

14:52.683 --> 14:55.644
Of course Maddy can go.
She's gonna lose her shit.

14:56.687 --> 14:59.440
Well, maybe you can come, too, after work.

15:01.066 --> 15:02.985
Okay. Yeah. Sounds good.

15:22.004 --> 15:23.088
Oh.

15:23.172 --> 15:24.006
-Hi.
-Hey.

15:24.089 --> 15:24.965
I was just, um...

15:28.636 --> 15:31.180
-And I guess you were going that way.
-Yeah.

15:35.476 --> 15:36.769
Yes. Yeah.

15:42.900 --> 15:43.859
Um...

15:47.863 --> 15:49.949
I should probably just go to sleep.

15:51.325 --> 15:52.159
Okay.

15:53.243 --> 15:54.078
Good night.

15:55.496 --> 15:56.330
Sweet dreams.

16:35.661 --> 16:40.666
Tomorrow, you're gonna
meet a real-life pony.

16:59.601 --> 17:03.397
I started calling 32 Coral Road
The Loving House

17:03.480 --> 17:05.232
after my very first visit.

17:06.150 --> 17:08.694
I've been cleaning their house for months.

17:09.361 --> 17:11.572
This amazing couple lives there.

17:14.199 --> 17:18.912
The husband is a retired professor
of some sort. Art History, I think.

17:22.541 --> 17:23.959
He's incredibly kind.

17:26.086 --> 17:30.174
He took an early retirement three years
ago to care for his wife full-time.

17:31.800 --> 17:36.305
I'm not sure if it's cancer
or something else.

17:36.680 --> 17:39.808
But judging by the number
of medications in the house,

17:39.892 --> 17:42.936
it's been a long, miserable illness.

17:45.856 --> 17:49.693
She never seems to get worse,
but never better either.

17:52.696 --> 17:56.492
He carries her to the bathroom
and treats her with such kindness.

17:59.369 --> 18:01.705
How does it feel to be loved like that?

18:03.207 --> 18:04.750
To be cared for like that.

18:05.584 --> 18:07.294
Just bone him already.

18:07.377 --> 18:10.964
He's cute, sweet. He's got money.
He's good with Branson.

18:11.048 --> 18:12.716
-Brady.
-What's the problem?

18:12.800 --> 18:17.221
Just be Nate's girlfriend, then
it's not weird for us to be living there.

18:17.304 --> 18:20.808
Yeah. I'm just gonna do some
mild prostitution, Mom.

18:20.891 --> 18:25.771
It's not prostitution if you like him.
And you do. I can tell.

18:26.313 --> 18:28.565
-I don't like Nate.
-Sure you do.

18:29.441 --> 18:33.237
Even if I did like him, he's not the guy
that I'm gonna bone for free housing.

18:33.320 --> 18:35.948
-He's relationship material.
-Great.

18:36.031 --> 18:39.576
We'll vacation in St. Barts.

18:39.660 --> 18:42.121
I've just got out of
a long-term thing with Sean.

18:43.122 --> 18:45.624
I don't wanna be dependent
on a guy for a hot second.

18:45.707 --> 18:48.752
Maybe I wanna go to college

18:48.836 --> 18:53.298
and get off food stamps
and buy a fucking house plant.

18:53.924 --> 18:54.925
Okay.

18:55.551 --> 18:58.804
Nate's house sure is nice.
Maybe a well-timed blowjob.

18:58.887 --> 19:00.597
-Make your mama proud.
-Hi.

19:00.681 --> 19:04.601
This here is Paula Langley,
and here is a copy of the deed.

19:04.685 --> 19:06.937
See? She owns it.

19:07.020 --> 19:09.606
That's well and good,
but that's not what my lease says.

19:09.690 --> 19:12.734
Sir, you need to either start paying us,
or you need to move out.

19:12.818 --> 19:15.988
I've got a signed lease that says
to pay Basil, not whoever you are.

19:16.071 --> 19:20.242
Basil is a piece of shit. Stop Venmo-ing
Basil and pay us instead.

19:20.325 --> 19:21.326
Not gonna happen.

19:21.869 --> 19:23.287
Sir, my mom owns this house.

19:26.582 --> 19:30.294
Great. You have no source of income
and we have nowhere to live.

19:30.377 --> 19:31.461
Exactly.

19:31.962 --> 19:33.964
Stop dodging dick.

19:37.885 --> 19:40.888
What the mind needs to know
is that there is someone there

19:40.971 --> 19:42.764
to make things better for you.

19:43.599 --> 19:47.436
Someone in your corner. That's what I
tried to take home from The Loving House.

19:47.519 --> 19:50.189
-Good. That's very good.
-The belief that it's possible.

19:50.272 --> 19:52.774
-Hi.
-Hey! Mommy's here.

19:52.858 --> 19:54.026
Hi!

19:56.820 --> 19:58.071
Look over there.

20:00.115 --> 20:01.825
-Who's this?
-String Cheese.

20:01.909 --> 20:04.494
-This is String Cheese?
-That's right. You wanna pet her?

20:04.578 --> 20:08.332
You wanna show me how to pet
String Cheese? I don't know how.

20:08.415 --> 20:09.333
How do I do it?

20:09.416 --> 20:11.501
Just like we talked about.
Right on the nose.

20:13.420 --> 20:16.882
Good girl. Now, do you wanna show Mommy
your cool trick?

20:16.965 --> 20:17.799
-Yes.
-Okay.

20:17.883 --> 20:21.386
Remember what we talked about.
Keep your palms straight out like this.

20:22.137 --> 20:24.598
Okay? Keep your hand straight.

20:26.558 --> 20:27.392
Put it up.

20:29.645 --> 20:30.479
Good girl.

20:30.979 --> 20:32.814
-Oh, my goodness.
-Yeah!

20:33.398 --> 20:34.650
That was so good.

20:35.776 --> 20:39.154
Yeah, we were about to take her out
for a ride. Brady's already out there.

20:39.238 --> 20:40.530
It's just in circles.

20:41.281 --> 20:43.116
If that's okay with you.

20:43.700 --> 20:47.329
Of course it's okay with me.
Do you wanna ride a pony, Maddy?

20:48.705 --> 20:49.915
-You do?
-Yes!

20:53.460 --> 20:54.294
Let's do it.

21:00.050 --> 21:01.593
Look, Mommy!

21:02.344 --> 21:03.470
I see.

21:06.014 --> 21:07.641
I'm riding a pony.

21:08.642 --> 21:09.643
Good job, honey.

21:11.478 --> 21:13.355
-Ready for it?
-Look, Mommy.

21:13.438 --> 21:15.148
You're doing such a good job.

21:16.650 --> 21:18.402
Both of those are big.

21:18.485 --> 21:20.654
She's a big girl,
and she's on a bigger pony.

21:20.737 --> 21:22.489
-It's a horse.
-That's a horse.

21:22.572 --> 21:25.492
-All of the other ones are horses.
-This is the only pony that you see?

21:25.575 --> 21:26.410
Yep.

21:31.581 --> 21:32.916
You having fun?

21:33.667 --> 21:35.377
You're doing such a good job.

21:44.511 --> 21:46.930
The Porn House
and The Loving House.

21:47.973 --> 21:50.517
In one, a dream is dashed.

21:51.226 --> 21:55.272
In the other,
a horrible tragedy is taking place.

21:55.355 --> 21:57.024
A life ending prematurely.

21:58.859 --> 22:01.778
And me? Just here
to dust the debris off both.

22:04.573 --> 22:06.992
-For minimum wage, I get to--
-Maddy down?

22:08.035 --> 22:10.579
Yep. Is Brady down?

22:11.079 --> 22:12.164
Yeah.

22:12.247 --> 22:13.206
Paula down?

22:16.626 --> 22:18.754
No. She is night painting.

22:19.338 --> 22:22.174
-Night painting.
-Which means that she has your work light

22:22.257 --> 22:24.051
and she's raided your pretzels.

22:24.134 --> 22:25.385
All right, Paula.

22:27.262 --> 22:28.263
Oh, is she...?

22:29.306 --> 22:32.642
Okay, because,
and I don't wanna pry, but...

22:33.727 --> 22:36.938
I overheard that maybe there's an issue
with her house.

22:37.606 --> 22:40.567
Oh, no, yeah, I sorted it out.

22:40.650 --> 22:44.279
You're sure? Because,
if I can help, I'm happy to.

22:44.863 --> 22:46.698
I sorted it all out, thank you.

22:47.908 --> 22:50.035
Are you the only person
looking after your mom?

22:50.118 --> 22:51.119
Like is your dad...?

22:51.703 --> 22:52.829
My dad isn't.

22:54.247 --> 22:56.124
All right. And no siblings?

22:56.958 --> 22:58.335
Nope. Just me.

23:01.755 --> 23:04.424
That must be tough.
I mean, being all alone with her.

23:05.467 --> 23:09.096
What? No. He told me everything.
We're gonna have a blast, Sean-y.

23:10.472 --> 23:12.724
Okay. That's-- Oh.

23:14.726 --> 23:17.646
Like, what, are your parents
happily married and normal?

23:17.729 --> 23:19.439
Well, now I can't tell you.

23:19.940 --> 23:22.484
Your parents are
happily married and normal.

23:22.567 --> 23:25.737
Yeah, they're retired, and they live
in Newport Beach most of the year.

23:25.821 --> 23:27.155
-That's awesome.
-Yeah.

23:28.824 --> 23:32.869
You know, I wish...
that you would let me help you.

23:35.872 --> 23:37.040
You are helping me.

23:37.124 --> 23:39.334
-You're helping me so much.
-Okay.

23:39.418 --> 23:44.714
Well, let me get a sitter for Brady
and Maddy and take you out to dinner.

23:47.384 --> 23:49.886
-You wanna take me to dinner?
-I do.

23:51.346 --> 23:54.558
I wanna take you to a movie.
I wanna get you a corsage.

24:01.523 --> 24:03.942
Nate, you're...

24:04.025 --> 24:04.943
Aw...

24:06.778 --> 24:07.612
Sorry.

24:08.655 --> 24:11.616
You're a really, really good guy.
I mean that.

24:13.118 --> 24:13.952
You are.

24:16.455 --> 24:18.123
But I'm your charity case.

24:18.874 --> 24:20.417
It's not charity.

24:21.668 --> 24:24.171
Right? You're-- You're my guest.

24:26.506 --> 24:29.009
I am charity.

24:29.092 --> 24:34.848
I am. I mean, you feed me, house me,
board me, hot-water me.

24:35.974 --> 24:37.225
You are the only difference

24:37.309 --> 24:41.313
between us sleeping in a bed
and sleeping on the street tonight.

24:43.773 --> 24:47.569
Yeah, I just don't know
how I could go to dinner with you

24:47.652 --> 24:50.906
and sit across the table from you
and share an appetizer,

24:50.989 --> 24:53.617
because it's not equal between us.

24:56.203 --> 24:58.997
I don't really care about that stuff.
I just...

25:00.749 --> 25:01.958
I think you like me,

25:02.792 --> 25:06.296
and I know I like you.

25:07.923 --> 25:09.007
That's equal.

25:09.549 --> 25:10.383
Right?

25:13.637 --> 25:16.306
I don't think I can
be with anybody right now.

25:28.235 --> 25:31.488
-Sorry, give me a second.
-You want me to come with you?

25:31.571 --> 25:32.405
That's okay.

25:36.910 --> 25:37.744
Hey!

25:38.245 --> 25:40.997
I gave you this address
because I was legally obligated to.

25:41.081 --> 25:44.417
-In no way was this an invitation.
-I need to talk to you. Okay?

25:44.501 --> 25:46.753
-About what?
-Everything okay out here?

25:46.836 --> 25:48.922
Yeah, I'm fine. I'll just be a minute.

25:49.005 --> 25:51.258
Hi, sorry to disturb, man. I'm Sean.

25:51.841 --> 25:55.720
Nate. We've met a number of times,
actually, most recently at Maddy's party.

25:55.804 --> 25:58.348
I don't... Are you usually memorable?

25:58.431 --> 25:59.933
-Sean.
-What?

26:00.016 --> 26:03.520
Um, you can go inside.
I won't be long. Thank you.

26:03.603 --> 26:05.981
-I'm fine.
-Give me a holler if you need anything.

26:06.064 --> 26:09.234
Oh, yeah, just give a holler,
on your trusty steed.

26:09.317 --> 26:11.194
What the fuck is your problem? Stop.

26:11.278 --> 26:12.988
It's great to meet you. Sean.

26:13.071 --> 26:15.532
Yeah, you too, buddy. Love the tech vest.

26:15.615 --> 26:16.449
What the fuck?

26:17.242 --> 26:18.785
I'm so sorry.

26:19.828 --> 26:21.246
Sean. Stop.

26:21.329 --> 26:22.539
Jesus Christ.

26:22.622 --> 26:25.125
-What are you doing? Um...
-Where's your mom?

26:25.208 --> 26:28.336
She's in the back painting.
You can't come here without an invitation.

26:28.420 --> 26:30.880
Okay, I think we should
show her this together.

26:30.964 --> 26:32.340
Show her what?

26:32.424 --> 26:34.551
This most recent activity on her mortgage.

26:35.510 --> 26:37.512
I found the folder you were looking for.

26:37.596 --> 26:39.097
With her mortgage stuff in it.

26:39.180 --> 26:41.016
I had her PIN, so I logged on,

26:41.099 --> 26:44.227
and I was gonna print it for you,
but then I saw that.

26:46.771 --> 26:47.647
Paula!

26:48.315 --> 26:50.275
-You back here?
-Not now!

26:50.358 --> 26:52.861
-Yes, now, it's very important.
-I'm in it.

26:52.944 --> 26:53.987
Mom! Mom!

26:54.070 --> 26:58.074
Hey, this is pretty cool, Paula,
what are you working on?

26:58.158 --> 27:00.702
It is. I'm turning
a real corner here, baby.

27:00.785 --> 27:02.621
I'm going global with my ideas.

27:02.704 --> 27:04.748
Yeah, lots going on. A lot of color.

27:04.831 --> 27:06.625
Shit.

27:06.708 --> 27:09.461
It's very heady stuff, Sean-y.
I don't expect you to know it.

27:09.544 --> 27:11.921
But basically it's deconstructed Arachne

27:12.005 --> 27:16.760
from Ovid's "Metamorphosis." You see?
Arachne wasn't always a spider.

27:16.843 --> 27:21.723
She was born a human,
but a very gifted weaver.

27:21.806 --> 27:22.807
Right, Sean-y?

27:22.891 --> 27:23.975
I dig it.

27:24.893 --> 27:26.394
It's very profound.

27:26.478 --> 27:27.896
Okay. Mom.

27:29.314 --> 27:31.358
Your mortgage is in default.

27:31.441 --> 27:34.402
So that means that your house
is about to be in foreclosure.

27:36.446 --> 27:37.697
I need to pee.

27:38.406 --> 27:41.451
Is that what all those
fucking 800 calls were about?

27:41.534 --> 27:45.330
I thought they were trying to
sign me up for some new phone plan.

27:45.413 --> 27:48.667
Paula, foreclosure means the bank
takes your house away.

27:48.750 --> 27:52.587
I will deal with this later.
I'm sure it's just a big mistake.

27:52.671 --> 27:55.340
No, it's not. Your mortgage
hasn't been paid in six months.

27:55.423 --> 27:56.549
Yes, it has.

27:56.633 --> 27:59.636
Basil does it.
He collects the rent from the tenants

27:59.719 --> 28:01.012
and he pays the mortgage.

28:01.096 --> 28:03.598
-I've seen him do it.
-I don't think that's true, Paula.

28:03.682 --> 28:06.351
It is true. I see him
write the checks for the mortgage,

28:06.434 --> 28:08.687
and I see him walk to the mailbox.

28:09.145 --> 28:12.774
Uh, yeah, I'm sure that he has written
some checks and walked to the mailbox,

28:12.857 --> 28:15.276
but I don't think that they were
to pay your mortgage.

28:15.360 --> 28:17.612
I think this whole thing
is a big mistake.

28:17.696 --> 28:20.240
I mean, maybe he doesn't use
enough postage.

28:20.323 --> 28:22.659
Use enough postage?
Are you fucking kidding me?

28:22.742 --> 28:25.036
-He's stealing from you.
-Okay, that's not helpful.

28:25.120 --> 28:30.333
Paula, all we need to do is find Basil.
Do you have any idea where he is?

28:30.417 --> 28:35.296
He needs to clear his head sometimes.
He goes off the grid. He is a searcher.

28:35.380 --> 28:37.382
What do you know about this guy?

28:38.967 --> 28:41.720
-He's not Australian.
-Yes, he is Australian.

28:41.803 --> 28:44.556
He's Australian! He's from fucking Perth!

28:44.639 --> 28:47.058
-Maddy's asleep.
-Okay, you think he's from Perth.

28:47.142 --> 28:49.519
Yep, but what else do we know about him?

28:50.478 --> 28:54.816
This whole thing is her fault.
She has been picking on him since day one.

28:54.899 --> 28:58.820
Calling him "Cilantro,"
doubting his business intentions!

28:58.903 --> 29:01.364
Don't you know what that does
to a man's psyche?

29:01.448 --> 29:03.616
Yes, I've been doubting
his business intentions.

29:03.700 --> 29:05.618
He's getting your house
foreclosed on, Mom!

29:05.702 --> 29:07.620
Wait. Paula, where's your phone?

29:08.204 --> 29:11.291
Fuck if I know, Sean!
I don't know! What are you--?

29:11.958 --> 29:15.587
Do you have a family plan with him?
You can use Find My Phone.

29:15.670 --> 29:17.756
God. I don't know, Sean-y, I just--

29:17.839 --> 29:19.841
-I don't know...
-You do.

29:19.924 --> 29:22.010
-And there he is.
-Where?

29:22.093 --> 29:25.680
Skagit, Caribou Casino.
Our boy's a gambler.

29:25.764 --> 29:29.100
-I have never seen him gamble. Never.
-This isn't a good thing.

29:29.184 --> 29:32.771
-Uh-uh.
-No, well, he's gambling right now.

29:32.854 --> 29:35.482
Actually, my buddy Jordan works there.
I'll drive.

29:35.565 --> 29:36.441
Hell yeah!

29:36.524 --> 29:38.651
-Now you're talking, road trip!
-Yeah?

29:38.735 --> 29:40.779
Let me get my good weed, baby. Hold on!

29:40.862 --> 29:44.407
No! We're not gonna go to a casino
to confront a con man. No!

29:44.491 --> 29:46.284
I feel like we're going to Burning Man,

29:46.367 --> 29:49.412
but instead of Burning Man,
we're going to Basil Man!

29:56.211 --> 29:59.756
He's gonna be so surprised to see me.

29:59.839 --> 30:00.840
Mm.

30:01.841 --> 30:03.426
Sean-y boy. Want some?

30:03.510 --> 30:05.970
-Oh, no, thank you. Thank you, Paula.
-Mom, he's sober.

30:06.054 --> 30:07.096
It's just pot.

30:07.889 --> 30:09.974
So, kiddos, what's the plan?

30:10.058 --> 30:13.645
I think I should make
some kind of grand entrance, huh?

30:13.728 --> 30:17.148
Oh, no, actually,
Jordan's just gonna bring him out to us.

30:17.232 --> 30:18.817
-Who's she?
-He.

30:18.900 --> 30:21.444
Oh, yeah, my buddy Jordan. He works there.

30:21.528 --> 30:25.323
This is all starting to make sense to me,
why I haven't heard from Basil.

30:25.406 --> 30:28.785
Because, you know, they have
terrible service out there at the rez.

30:28.868 --> 30:32.121
And they pump those rooms full of oxygen

30:32.205 --> 30:34.958
because they want you
to lose track of time.

30:35.041 --> 30:36.626
Jordan has service.

30:37.126 --> 30:39.379
Oh. But I have gum.

30:39.462 --> 30:43.925
I've got strawberry, I've got bubblegum,
I've got spearmint, lemon.

30:44.008 --> 30:45.009
I'll try lemon.

30:45.093 --> 30:47.053
Why do you have so much gum, Mom?

30:47.136 --> 30:48.096
Oh.

30:48.179 --> 30:50.682
I met the nicest guy

30:50.765 --> 30:55.812
down by the ferry the other day,
selling gum out of the trunk of his car.

30:56.980 --> 30:58.189
This is trunk gum!

30:59.023 --> 31:00.900
Yeah, best kind.

31:01.484 --> 31:02.360
He was a vet.

31:02.443 --> 31:06.573
I think he was just so grateful

31:06.656 --> 31:09.409
to have somebody sit and talk with him.

31:09.492 --> 31:12.704
-And I guided him right to the light.
-How much longer?

31:13.413 --> 31:16.332
-I said, "Ricardo, baby...
-Nineteen miles.

31:16.416 --> 31:20.086
-...you have to bend towards the sun."
-Nineteen miles.

31:20.628 --> 31:22.589
What do you mean by that, Paula?

31:23.381 --> 31:27.260
Well, you know, baby,
that's where you get your fire from,

31:27.844 --> 31:31.389
is you bend towards the sun
and it lights you up inside.

31:31.472 --> 31:33.057
I never thought of it that way.

31:33.641 --> 31:36.477
-Can you text him? Tell him we're here.
-Yep.

31:37.020 --> 31:40.523
Mom, remember, we don't know exactly
what we're walking into,

31:40.607 --> 31:43.526
so let's stay real calm, okay?

31:43.610 --> 31:45.653
Hey...

31:45.737 --> 31:48.239
Oh, my God, he's here! Look!

31:48.823 --> 31:51.576
There's his RV! He is here!

32:00.001 --> 32:03.046
All right. Jordan's gonna
bring him out those doors any minute now.

32:03.755 --> 32:05.256
You guys should stay put.

32:09.510 --> 32:12.055
Hey, Mom, Mom, what are you doing? Mom!

32:12.138 --> 32:13.640
Fuck off! Fuck you!

32:13.723 --> 32:15.099
Stop! Don't hurt him.

32:15.183 --> 32:17.101
-What the hell, asshole?
-Hey, Mom.

32:17.185 --> 32:18.770
I'm doing nothing wrong in there!

32:18.853 --> 32:20.772
That dealer's
got no fucking sense of humor.

32:20.855 --> 32:24.609
I tell one fucking off-color joke.
I've still got fucking chips on the table.

32:24.692 --> 32:26.819
-Get the fuck off me!
-Hey!

32:29.822 --> 32:32.075
Paula, what are you doing here?

32:32.659 --> 32:35.620
You didn't have an accent just now.
You didn't...

32:36.746 --> 32:39.958
-Where's your Australian accent, Basil?
-Yeah, yeah.

32:40.041 --> 32:41.876
I'm scared. That's why my voice is off.

32:41.960 --> 32:45.129
These fucking ogres are terrifying me,
babe, I'm so glad you're here.

32:45.213 --> 32:46.673
Are you not Australian?

32:48.841 --> 32:51.594
Of course I am. I'm born in Perth, right?

32:51.678 --> 32:54.722
-We've been over this a million times.
-Wait, now.

32:54.806 --> 32:56.015
Okay.

32:57.725 --> 33:00.478
Just tell me the truth. Please.

33:01.312 --> 33:03.356
Okay? Just tell me the truth.

33:09.237 --> 33:12.198
I was born there, yeah. I just--

33:12.281 --> 33:16.494
I just exaggerate the accent a little bit,
you know. I just bung it on.

33:17.704 --> 33:20.289
You were so charmed by it.
And I just wanted you--

33:20.373 --> 33:23.084
-Hey, where's her mortgage money?
-What money?

33:23.668 --> 33:27.922
The money you collected from the tenants.
You didn't pay her mortgage.

33:30.383 --> 33:31.676
Oh.

33:31.759 --> 33:36.305
Is that what this is about?
No, no, no, that's a huge mistake.

33:36.389 --> 33:39.392
Yeah, I paid it. I called the bank today
and spoke to them about--

33:39.475 --> 33:43.604
Hey. Stop. We know you didn't pay it.
So where is it?

33:54.449 --> 33:56.034
Okay, okay.

33:57.118 --> 33:59.746
Okay. I can explain, all right?

34:01.789 --> 34:03.624
I have a bit of a gambling problem.

34:04.208 --> 34:07.336
Okay, and I've been struggling
to stay off the tables.

34:08.212 --> 34:09.922
And I ran up a bit of a debt.

34:11.382 --> 34:14.510
-Is the money all gone?
-See, that's why I'm back here, you know?

34:14.594 --> 34:17.221
I'm trying to make this right.
I'm trying to win it back.

34:17.805 --> 34:19.057
The money's all gone?

34:23.227 --> 34:24.103
Yeah.

34:25.521 --> 34:28.316
-I'm gonna lose my house.
-I'm so sorry, baby.

34:28.399 --> 34:30.735
That house was my mother's house.

34:31.569 --> 34:33.529
It is the only thing

34:33.613 --> 34:35.698
anyone has ever given me

34:35.782 --> 34:38.242
in my entire life.

34:40.036 --> 34:41.454
I made it art.

34:42.038 --> 34:43.790
Every room,

34:43.873 --> 34:45.083
every wall,

34:45.166 --> 34:46.375
was my art gallery.

34:50.254 --> 34:51.798
It is my life.

34:53.508 --> 34:55.134
It is where...

34:55.218 --> 34:59.013
my best self lives.

35:00.264 --> 35:01.974
You motherfucker.

35:02.642 --> 35:05.728
You motherfucker!

35:05.812 --> 35:07.563
I have a problem and I'll get help.

35:07.647 --> 35:09.857
-Please don't leave me.
-Oh, fuck you.

35:09.941 --> 35:13.694
Just get my shit out of the RV.
You get the fuck away!

35:13.778 --> 35:14.654
Baby!

35:14.737 --> 35:18.241
Baby, we're married, okay?
I know I'm a piece of shit, but I love--

35:18.324 --> 35:19.325
Get the fuck off me!

35:19.408 --> 35:20.576
I love you!

35:20.660 --> 35:22.036
Fuck you!

35:22.120 --> 35:23.579
Fuck you!

35:34.465 --> 35:36.300
You okay back there, Mom?

35:37.135 --> 35:38.177
Told you so.

35:40.555 --> 35:42.431
-Told me what?
-No, you.

35:44.600 --> 35:47.937
You're dying to say it, so just...
go ahead and say it.

35:49.689 --> 35:51.649
This isn't a victory for me, Mom.

35:51.732 --> 35:52.775
Yes, it is.

36:00.700 --> 36:01.909
-Hey, Nate.
-Hey.

36:01.993 --> 36:04.745
Uh, hope you don't mind me
checking on you.

36:04.829 --> 36:06.873
That's very sweet of you, thank you.

36:07.582 --> 36:09.000
Maddy didn't wake up, did she?

36:09.083 --> 36:11.711
No, she hasn't made a peep. You okay?

36:11.794 --> 36:15.506
No, yeah, we're okay.
I'll be back. I'll be back soon.

36:15.590 --> 36:16.924
Okay. See you soon.

36:17.008 --> 36:19.427
Thank you. All right, bye.

36:19.510 --> 36:21.053
Must be nice.

36:23.806 --> 36:25.892
-What?
-Being you.

36:26.767 --> 36:31.772
Having a bunch of doobies all lined up
to please you all hours of the day.

36:31.856 --> 36:33.316
Must be nice.

36:34.025 --> 36:39.572
You don't even have to spread your legs.
They just pant around you anyway.

36:39.655 --> 36:41.157
Stop it, Mom.

36:41.741 --> 36:45.328
-You're not mad at me.
-No, I am fucking mad at you!

36:45.411 --> 36:48.623
You're taking pleasure in this,
I know you are.

36:48.706 --> 36:51.375
You're doing a little dance
in your heart right now.

36:51.459 --> 36:54.378
Just about how fucking right
you were about Basil!

36:54.462 --> 36:57.256
You're gonna go home
and write about it in your journal.

36:57.340 --> 37:00.092
"I was right, I was right, I was right."

37:00.176 --> 37:02.762
Well, congratulations, baby!

37:02.845 --> 37:04.847
You were fucking right!

37:05.431 --> 37:06.474
Fuck you!

37:06.557 --> 37:08.684
Whoa, Paula, pump the brakes.

37:08.768 --> 37:10.019
I wanna go home!

37:10.102 --> 37:11.729
-All right.

37:16.651 --> 37:17.610
Give me that.

37:19.820 --> 37:20.696
Are you okay?

37:20.780 --> 37:22.615
She's fucking fine!

37:22.698 --> 37:25.368
I'm fine! We're all fine!

37:26.786 --> 37:29.247
I wanna go home!

37:30.122 --> 37:31.791
I think I got everything.

37:31.874 --> 37:34.210
The wallet is
the most important thing, right?

37:34.293 --> 37:35.419
Thanks.

37:35.503 --> 37:37.088
I just wanna go home.

37:50.685 --> 37:51.894
It's all right, Mom.

38:12.206 --> 38:13.749
Can you look up...?

38:14.250 --> 38:16.168
-Sorry?
-Can you look up a gas station?

38:24.885 --> 38:26.512
There's one in a couple of miles.

38:33.602 --> 38:34.603
Sorry.

38:35.688 --> 38:36.689
Hmm?

38:38.399 --> 38:40.067
I'll just make a quick stop.

38:41.110 --> 38:42.653
Hey, do you have any cash?

38:44.572 --> 38:45.489
No.

38:47.533 --> 38:50.578
Paula, you don't have cash, do you?

38:50.661 --> 38:52.204
She doesn't. Are we short?

38:52.663 --> 38:56.292
No, it's fine, I'll just put
five bucks, ought to get us home.

38:56.375 --> 38:57.793
I'll put it on the card.

39:00.796 --> 39:01.881
I've got to pee.

39:22.735 --> 39:26.947
She doesn't mean it, you know,
when she goes for your jugular like that.

39:28.282 --> 39:32.787
My mom does the exact same thing to me,
and she goes right in with her teeth.

39:33.329 --> 39:35.206
They just know how to do it.

39:48.511 --> 39:50.346
Neither of us do that to Maddy.

39:55.059 --> 39:56.185
No, we don't.

39:57.686 --> 39:59.230
Nobody bites our girl.

40:07.571 --> 40:09.782
What the fuck am I gonna do with her?

40:14.036 --> 40:16.122
She has no savings.

40:17.081 --> 40:19.041
No retirement plan.

40:19.125 --> 40:20.334
No insurance.

40:21.377 --> 40:22.503
No job.

40:22.586 --> 40:23.712
No house.

40:25.005 --> 40:26.799
No way to refinance her house,

40:26.882 --> 40:30.094
which has been her only source of income
for the past ten years.

40:32.638 --> 40:34.849
She just became my full-time problem.

40:36.100 --> 40:37.059
Our problem.

40:38.102 --> 40:38.936
Okay?

40:39.854 --> 40:41.730
We'll figure it out.

40:41.814 --> 40:43.691
She's my mom, Sean.

40:44.984 --> 40:46.277
We are not a "we."

40:47.445 --> 40:49.029
She's Maddy's grandma.

40:50.197 --> 40:51.949
We are a "we" on this.

40:53.826 --> 40:55.035
We'll figure it out.

40:57.371 --> 40:58.205
Okay?

41:00.958 --> 41:02.042
You're not alone.

41:10.926 --> 41:12.136
Let go of my hand.

41:14.138 --> 41:14.972
Yep.

41:20.978 --> 41:21.854
You should--

41:23.397 --> 41:25.316
You should go check on your mom.

41:38.245 --> 41:39.288
Hey, Mom?

41:42.082 --> 41:43.751
Mom, you all right in there?

42:14.698 --> 42:17.117
-She's gone. She wasn't in there.
-What do you mean?

42:17.201 --> 42:20.788
-I don't know where the fuck she went.
-Think she hitchhiked?

42:22.373 --> 42:27.294
Hey. Hey, man, did you see a lady walk
by here? With like a fur coat? No?

42:40.099 --> 42:40.933
Fuck.

42:42.059 --> 42:42.977
Shit.

42:43.811 --> 42:45.729
I know where she is. Okay.

42:46.230 --> 42:48.148
-Right, you know?
-Fuck me. Yeah.

43:12.923 --> 43:14.675
Alex. Alex!

43:15.426 --> 43:17.469
-Motherfucker!

43:18.470 --> 43:19.888
It's my house!

43:19.972 --> 43:21.849
-Mom!
-It's my house, you--

43:21.932 --> 43:24.101
-Mom, what the fuck?
-He changed the locks!

43:24.184 --> 43:26.645
-Take your hand off.
-He changed the locks.

43:26.729 --> 43:28.564
He's a fucking-- It's my house!

43:28.647 --> 43:31.609
-He moved my spare key!
-Paula, I need you to--

43:31.692 --> 43:33.986
-He moved my spare key!
-What the fuck?

43:34.069 --> 43:35.988
Stay inside, man! Stay inside!

43:36.071 --> 43:38.449
-My birdbath, Sean-y!
-Paula, I got this.

43:38.532 --> 43:39.825
It's my...

43:41.952 --> 43:44.747
-This was my mama's house.
-I'm gonna put some pressure on it.

43:44.830 --> 43:46.832
This is my grandmama's house.

43:46.915 --> 43:50.961
-Alex, Alex! Call 911! Call 911!
-You can't do this! It's my house!

43:54.131 --> 43:55.382
It's my house.

44:02.514 --> 44:05.893
-It's my house!
-Put pressure on it. Put pressure on it.

44:08.020 --> 44:09.938
It could have been your house.

44:19.156 --> 44:20.407
We have her stabilized.

44:20.491 --> 44:22.993
She cut her flexor tendon,
which caused a lot of blood loss.

44:23.077 --> 44:26.914
So we're gonna prep her up
for surgery and admit her overnight.

44:28.540 --> 44:29.667
Okay.

44:29.750 --> 44:32.378
Is there any reason
we need to stick around?

44:32.461 --> 44:34.630
No, we're just gonna monitor...

44:36.548 --> 44:38.759
Did you get any of that?
She lost a lot of blood,

44:38.842 --> 44:43.138
and she cut something
called a flexor tendon in her wrist.

44:44.223 --> 44:48.018
Cut it in half, so they're gonna have
to do surgery and stitches.

44:50.437 --> 44:51.689
Nod that you hear me.

45:02.741 --> 45:03.659
Alex.

45:07.705 --> 45:09.707
They're gonna keep her overnight.

45:09.790 --> 45:12.751
And there's really not anything more
we can do.

45:23.554 --> 45:25.264
Nate can watch Maddy, right?

45:27.474 --> 45:28.350
Alex?

45:31.395 --> 45:34.189
All right. I'm gonna take you home, okay?

45:48.746 --> 45:50.622
If you want to get cleaned up.

46:57.856 --> 46:58.982
Ladies first.

47:27.594 --> 47:29.304
Maddy rode a pony today.

47:33.392 --> 47:34.226
What?

47:39.439 --> 47:40.482
This morning.

47:43.151 --> 47:44.945
Maddy rode a real, live pony.

47:48.490 --> 47:50.242
She was really, really happy.

48:02.713 --> 48:04.464
My mom's so fucked up.

48:08.385 --> 48:09.219
Hey.

48:10.762 --> 48:11.680
Hey.

48:14.558 --> 48:15.851
Hey, it's all right.

48:16.351 --> 48:17.269
It's all right.

48:17.895 --> 48:18.812
It's okay.

48:22.190 --> 48:23.358
We knew that.

48:25.861 --> 48:26.820
Not like this.

48:27.571 --> 48:30.407
She's covered in blood
and she's in a psych ward.

48:33.577 --> 48:34.828
She was scary.

48:38.332 --> 48:40.292
The whole thing was really scary.

48:49.718 --> 48:53.472
-Do you think that's gonna be me one day?
-No.

48:53.555 --> 48:55.599
Do you think
I'm gonna scare Maddy like that?

48:55.682 --> 48:57.476
No. No.

48:59.478 --> 49:00.896
Alex, not a chance.

49:07.945 --> 49:09.112
I'm sorry.

49:09.196 --> 49:10.072
Don't be.

49:11.281 --> 49:14.034
-Sorry.
-No. Don't be. It's okay.

49:14.701 --> 49:15.577
I'm sorry.

49:15.661 --> 49:17.829
It's all-- Look, if it was my mom...

49:19.289 --> 49:21.416
I'd probably be crying all over you.

49:23.460 --> 49:24.753
As a matter of fact,

49:25.337 --> 49:28.757
I think I snarfed all over you
when my mom relapsed.

50:04.418 --> 50:05.919
-Alex.
-Please.

50:25.147 --> 50:27.065
-Is this what you want?
-Yes.

50:28.775 --> 50:29.609
Yes.

50:30.569 --> 50:31.611
Yes.
