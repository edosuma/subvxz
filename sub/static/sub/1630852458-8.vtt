WEBVTT

00:40.874 --> 00:41.750
That's hot.

00:54.262 --> 00:55.305
Morning, Greg.

00:56.639 --> 00:57.724
No!

00:58.308 --> 01:00.060
It isn't. You know why?

01:00.894 --> 01:05.106
Because some freeloader
was blaring shitty Metallica all night.

01:05.690 --> 01:08.151
Yeah, that was actually
Exodus’s <i>Bonded by Blood,</i>

01:08.234 --> 01:10.612
but it's not your fault
you don't know the genre.

01:10.695 --> 01:13.907
You do know your sister doesn't want
you crashing here, right?

01:13.990 --> 01:15.408
She only took pity on you

01:15.492 --> 01:19.496
because you are
an unemployed man baby on probation.

01:19.579 --> 01:21.206
I'm actually off probation now.

01:21.706 --> 01:24.959
I'm showered and groomed.
I have somewhere important to be today.

01:25.043 --> 01:27.629
Oh, well, that's good.
Congratulations. Good for you.

01:27.712 --> 01:30.006
That means you can
take your perfect circle of a body

01:30.090 --> 01:32.425
and roll your sloppy ass
out of our neighborhood.

01:32.509 --> 01:33.843
Step it back a smidge.

01:33.927 --> 01:36.387
You drive a Miata.
Think you're the King of Egypt?

01:36.471 --> 01:39.349
I don't know about cars,
but I know that's not top of the line.

01:39.432 --> 01:40.892
This is coming from a man

01:41.601 --> 01:44.938
who has a squirrel obstacle course
in his backyard.

01:45.021 --> 01:47.357
Do you have any friends, Raymond?

01:48.233 --> 01:51.653
I believe it was Emerson who said
that "a friend is the hope of the heart."

01:51.736 --> 01:53.571
Yeah. Well, it was Hughes who said,

01:54.364 --> 02:00.161
"Get your goddamn Frisbees off my roof
or I'm calling the police."

02:00.245 --> 02:02.247
Hughes because
it's your last name? Clever.

02:02.330 --> 02:05.750
Listen, those are Aerobies, Greg.
They're not Frisbees. Different disc.

02:05.834 --> 02:09.754
I-I don't have time to talk about that
'cause my dojo needs me. So…

02:09.838 --> 02:12.465
-Got to go. Sorry.
-That's right. I forgot, Raymond.

02:12.549 --> 02:16.344
You like to hang with a bunch of kids
and play kung fu all day.

02:16.427 --> 02:17.720
It is pathetic.

02:23.101 --> 02:24.185
It's not kung fu.

02:25.603 --> 02:27.230
It's Cobra Kai.

02:28.523 --> 02:30.692
And it's not Raymond anymore.

02:31.234 --> 02:32.777
My name is S--

02:32.861 --> 02:34.612
Stingray. Yeah, I know.

02:34.696 --> 02:38.032
And as much as you try
to clean your life up,

02:38.116 --> 02:39.993
you still stink, Ray.

02:40.660 --> 02:42.662
Stink-Ray!

02:45.081 --> 02:48.042
That is so much more appropriate!
Stink-Ray!

02:49.502 --> 02:50.670
Tread carefully, Greg.

02:51.546 --> 02:52.714
You mess with a Cobra,

02:53.756 --> 02:54.924
you get the fangs.

03:10.732 --> 03:12.859


03:14.319 --> 03:15.153
Time for class.

03:17.405 --> 03:18.406
Listen, John.

03:21.284 --> 03:22.619
I just want you to know

03:23.578 --> 03:25.413
I haven't forgotten what you did for me.

03:26.956 --> 03:29.000
I wouldn't be here if not for you.

03:29.584 --> 03:31.669
And I'll do anything to prove my loyalty.

03:33.087 --> 03:33.922
Anything.

03:40.929 --> 03:42.263
Let's go to work, Sensei.

03:45.475 --> 03:49.062
Guys, the limo is coming at six.

03:49.145 --> 03:51.648
So don't be late or else we're leaving.

03:51.731 --> 03:54.484
'Cause my date and I, we on a mission.

03:54.567 --> 03:58.112
Oh my God.
I bet she doesn't even exist.

03:58.196 --> 03:59.864
-Hey.
-Hey.

04:00.907 --> 04:02.492
You're, uh… You're gonna go?

04:02.575 --> 04:03.451
To prom?

04:04.160 --> 04:07.580
Yeah, right.
Let the rich kids have their stupid party.

04:08.498 --> 04:11.584
-Can you picture me in a ballroom dress?
-All right, class. Fall in.

04:16.547 --> 04:18.508
Today's lesson is about balance.

04:19.092 --> 04:21.261
Not the way Miyagi-Do teaches it.

04:22.929 --> 04:26.266
You're going to learn how
to get inside the heads of your opponents

04:27.016 --> 04:29.686
and throw them off balance.

04:30.478 --> 04:31.562
Pair up.

04:33.564 --> 04:34.399
Ais!

04:40.822 --> 04:41.948
You know, you should go.

04:42.865 --> 04:46.202
Crashing you-know-who's big night would be
a way to get your opponents off balance.

04:46.703 --> 04:50.790
-Not as much as if you showed up.
-I’m not a student. They won't let me in.

04:52.041 --> 04:52.959
Maybe they would.

04:54.168 --> 04:55.169
If you went with me.

04:57.672 --> 04:58.965
Did you just ask me to prom?

04:59.465 --> 05:01.301
Strictly a tactical move.

05:01.384 --> 05:03.886
Well, it’s such short notice.
We’d have to get a ride.

05:03.970 --> 05:05.013
Still need a tux.

05:05.096 --> 05:06.514
I think it's a great idea.

05:07.557 --> 05:08.766
And if you're going,

05:09.767 --> 05:11.019
you're going in style.

05:14.063 --> 05:17.025
Wassup!

05:17.108 --> 05:19.152
Remember that
from the old Bud commercials?

05:19.235 --> 05:22.280
I guess you guys were too young for…
Probably weren't even born.

05:22.363 --> 05:26.326
Eddie, what's going on, man? Hey, good
to see you. Dieter, how's your mom doing?

05:26.409 --> 05:28.995
Wish she'd call.
You could've had a really cool stepdad.

05:29.078 --> 05:30.246
Sensei!

05:30.997 --> 05:34.834
Sir, I am reporting for duty
and I require no thanks.

05:34.917 --> 05:35.918
Thanks for what?

05:36.002 --> 05:39.339
Oh, uh, you know, just defending the dojo

05:39.422 --> 05:42.258
and I-I served my time, Sensei sir.

05:42.342 --> 05:44.677
Look, we're trying to train
for a tournament.

05:45.178 --> 05:46.637
Let's carry on, everyone.

05:46.721 --> 05:49.140
The All Valley tourney. I'm well aware.

05:49.223 --> 05:52.769
Say, listen, I got a couple of good ideas.
Just basic strategy.

05:52.852 --> 05:54.645
Don't be ridiculous.

05:56.314 --> 05:59.317
You were never part of this team.
You're a buffoon.

06:00.318 --> 06:02.653
A joker, an embarrassment.

06:03.863 --> 06:05.990
You have no value here.

06:09.202 --> 06:10.244
Wow, what?

06:10.745 --> 06:12.163
But, Sensei, I'm, um,

06:13.623 --> 06:15.041
one of the guys, you know.

06:15.708 --> 06:18.336
You will never be Cobra Kai.

06:19.337 --> 06:20.296
You get that?

06:24.926 --> 06:27.428
Oh, wait, wait, w-wait, I got you.

06:27.512 --> 06:28.638
Th-This is, um…

06:29.806 --> 06:31.891
This is a test, right?

06:33.476 --> 06:35.311
Yeah, this is a test.

06:36.270 --> 06:38.523
Get the hell out of here.

06:43.736 --> 06:44.987
Challenge accepted.

06:54.747 --> 06:57.417
Why are you cutting
the mozzarella? You're gonna dry it out.

06:57.500 --> 06:59.961
-You're losing the juice!
-I'm making bruschetta.

07:00.044 --> 07:01.963
Let the juice out
so the bread don't get soggy.

07:02.046 --> 07:04.924
-Let me get in there.
-I’ll bite your fat fingers off!

07:05.007 --> 07:08.428
-But you disrespect--
-Louie’s sister's more Louie than Louie.

07:09.554 --> 07:11.222
I get nervous having family over

07:11.305 --> 07:13.349
while we’re dealing
with the Anthony crisis.

07:13.433 --> 07:16.602
I know. Bullying is the last thing
I ever thought we'd be dealing with.

07:16.686 --> 07:17.770
Yeah, well,

07:17.854 --> 07:20.064
two more weeks in his room
with no screen time

07:20.148 --> 07:21.607
and he’ll get the message.

07:21.691 --> 07:23.943
If he doesn't,
maybe we take him to a professional.

07:24.026 --> 07:26.404
Whatever happens,
can we keep your mom out of this?

07:26.904 --> 07:29.323
-I'm finally on stable ground with her.
-Okay.

07:29.407 --> 07:30.908
These are dinner napkins.

07:30.992 --> 07:34.579
I'm gonna swap 'em out
for something a little more appropriate.

07:35.288 --> 07:38.249
Whatever you like, Lucille.
My house is your house.

07:42.295 --> 07:43.337
Hey, come on in.

07:43.421 --> 07:45.339
-Make yourselves at home.
-Amanda. Welcome.

07:45.423 --> 07:46.966
-Oh, hi. Rosa.
-Hi.

07:47.049 --> 07:48.342
It's good to see you.

07:48.426 --> 07:50.052
Oh, you look very dashing.

07:57.351 --> 07:59.187
Okay, here she comes.

08:06.194 --> 08:09.530
Wow, you, uh, look so amazing.

08:09.614 --> 08:10.781
So do you.

08:10.865 --> 08:11.741
I guess, um…

08:17.538 --> 08:19.665
Can't believe we finally
get a night to ourselves.

08:19.749 --> 08:23.002
Yeah. No karate, no rivalries.

08:23.085 --> 08:24.337
Just, uh, you and me.

08:26.130 --> 08:27.423
Picture time. Let's go.

08:27.507 --> 08:29.217
Diazes, get together.

08:29.300 --> 08:30.593
You look so handsome.

08:31.636 --> 08:33.596
He looks more and more like his father.

08:34.138 --> 08:34.972
Mama.

08:36.891 --> 08:39.393
So, uh, how you been, man?

08:39.477 --> 08:41.729
-H-How's your weekend going?
-I'm fine.

08:44.273 --> 08:47.151
You know, I don't hang out
with those biker guys anymore. So…

08:47.652 --> 08:48.653
Uh, Johnny.

08:49.153 --> 08:49.987
Come on.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.034
Okay.

08:56.786 --> 09:00.331
Beautiful.
Let's get the LaRussos together. Anthony!

09:00.414 --> 09:02.583
-Uh, no, he doesn't need to come down.
-Oh.

09:03.125 --> 09:05.169
Thought I was supposed to stay in my room?

09:05.253 --> 09:08.798
Who told you to stay in your room?
He's grounded? What happened?

09:08.881 --> 09:10.716
Ma, we'll talk about it later, okay?

09:11.467 --> 09:12.843
Okay.

09:13.678 --> 09:16.681
All right. Everybody now.
One big happy family. Let's go.

09:17.348 --> 09:20.351
-Find your spot.
-Even Louie can get in the picture.

09:20.434 --> 09:21.644
Okay. Alrighty.

09:21.727 --> 09:24.230
One, two, three.

09:27.483 --> 09:29.694
Well, looks like it's just us tonight.
What should we do?

09:30.194 --> 09:31.654
Uh, is that a trick question?

09:31.737 --> 09:33.906
I meant for dinner. Not a trick.

09:34.657 --> 09:37.326
Uh, ooh, maybe I'll make
<i>un hornado de chancho.</i>

09:37.410 --> 09:38.244
Johnny.

09:39.745 --> 09:40.580
Who's that?

09:41.706 --> 09:42.915
Shannon, this is…

09:42.999 --> 09:44.542
Carmen. His girlfriend.

09:46.252 --> 09:49.046
Hi. I'm… Robby's mom.

09:51.257 --> 09:52.383
Can we talk?

09:54.802 --> 09:55.761
It's nice to meet you.

09:59.307 --> 10:01.684
-What's going on?
-Don't you have a phone?

10:01.767 --> 10:02.893
Yeah, inside.

10:03.436 --> 10:05.771
All right, look, this rich guy,

10:05.855 --> 10:07.064
Silver,

10:07.148 --> 10:10.276
he came by my apartment today
and he gave Robby a car

10:10.359 --> 10:11.569
to take to prom,

10:11.652 --> 10:15.448
saying that him and his date
were gonna go first class all the way.

10:16.198 --> 10:18.451
-Robby's going to prom?
-That's not the point.

10:18.951 --> 10:20.036
He gave me this.

10:20.119 --> 10:23.331
Said he wanted
to make sure Robby was taken care of.

10:23.414 --> 10:26.459
Said he'd find me a new place to live.
Even offered me a job.

10:26.542 --> 10:28.502
Doing what? I didn't ask.

10:28.586 --> 10:30.588
But if there's one kind of person I know,

10:30.671 --> 10:32.465
it's a rich guy who wants something.

10:32.548 --> 10:33.716
Son of a bitch.

10:33.799 --> 10:37.762
I tried to talk to Robby,
but this guy, he has his hooks in him.

10:38.763 --> 10:42.933
Since this is Cobra Kai or whatever,
you need to handle this.

10:43.017 --> 10:43.851
Don't worry.

10:46.562 --> 10:47.396
I will.

11:07.458 --> 11:08.292
Woo!

11:15.174 --> 11:16.050
Dude, this sucks.

11:16.717 --> 11:19.387
Prom without a date is like
Halloween with no candy. There's no point.

11:20.054 --> 11:22.932
I mean, at least we're not the only ones
in for a boring night.

11:23.015 --> 11:25.101
I heard Logan Wang's
after-party got canceled.

11:25.184 --> 11:27.186
His brother got
in some middle school fight.

11:27.269 --> 11:30.314
That supposed to make us feel better?
That everyone else's night is ruined?

11:30.398 --> 11:33.818
Yeah. It’s literally the definition
of "misery loves company."

11:35.111 --> 11:36.153
Demetri.

11:36.779 --> 11:37.655
Oh, my--

11:37.738 --> 11:39.448
Jessica Rabbit!

11:39.532 --> 11:40.950
W-What are you doing here?

11:41.033 --> 11:42.118
I just flew in.

11:42.201 --> 11:45.371
-W-What about your dad's wedding?
-Oh, I'll get back in time.

11:45.913 --> 11:47.540
You're more important.

11:48.040 --> 11:51.252
I even flew economy plus,
which is total shit.

11:51.335 --> 11:53.170
The seats don't even lie flat.

11:53.254 --> 11:54.088
Wow.

11:54.171 --> 11:55.923
You really do like me, huh?

11:56.006 --> 11:57.883
Oh, you have no idea.

11:59.927 --> 12:02.096
Mm. Come on, let's go dance.

12:02.179 --> 12:03.180
Yes, my queen.

12:04.598 --> 12:06.016
I-I gotta, you know.

12:06.851 --> 12:08.102
Woo!

12:08.185 --> 12:09.186
Let's go!

12:09.729 --> 12:11.731
-Hi.
-Hi!

12:12.481 --> 12:14.150
I can't believe you're here!

12:24.869 --> 12:25.703
High heels?

12:26.704 --> 12:30.374
No, no. It's the flying tornado kick
Johnny had me practicing.

12:30.958 --> 12:32.626
Don't understand how I'm gonna use it.

12:32.710 --> 12:34.378
I thought we said no karate talk?

12:35.254 --> 12:36.255
Right, right.

12:36.839 --> 12:38.674
Tonight is just about us.

12:41.886 --> 12:42.762
Cheers.

12:57.026 --> 12:58.652
Oh my God.

13:01.739 --> 13:03.240
I said no, all right?

13:03.324 --> 13:05.618
I'm telling you, cuz, she's really good.

13:05.701 --> 13:08.329
She's in her second year
of grad school for child psychology.

13:08.412 --> 13:10.915
-Who is?
-Uh, Cousin Vanessa.

13:10.998 --> 13:13.292
-She wants to help out with Anthony.

13:14.502 --> 13:17.213
Oh, no offense,
but if we were gonna get a pro,

13:17.296 --> 13:20.007
we could do better
than Marisa Tomei Junior.

13:20.090 --> 13:22.551
I am offended.
I'm gonna make you eat those words.

13:22.635 --> 13:25.429
-Hey, Ness! Nessa! Come here!
-Louie.

13:28.599 --> 13:30.810
Hey, sis, tell them
what you told me about Ant.

13:31.560 --> 13:33.771
I mean I can't say for sure
what his deal is.

13:33.854 --> 13:35.105
-That's fine.
-That's too bad.

13:35.189 --> 13:36.398
My educated guess would be

13:36.482 --> 13:39.443
environmentally-induced
Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder,

13:39.527 --> 13:43.155
possibly related to a screen dependency,
or full-blown IGD.

13:43.239 --> 13:46.033
I’d want to look
at the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual.

13:46.116 --> 13:47.660
It’s an evolving science.

13:49.119 --> 13:51.997
Uh, okay. Uh, well…

13:53.582 --> 13:56.752
Have at him. He's… upstairs.
Second door on the left.

13:56.836 --> 13:59.547
Oh, that's not how this works.
I don't wanna talk to him.

14:00.047 --> 14:01.131
I wanna talk to you.

14:10.349 --> 14:12.518
You think changing the lock's
gonna stop me?

14:14.603 --> 14:16.105
Come out, you sons of bitches!

14:30.077 --> 14:31.161
Hello?

14:31.245 --> 14:34.456
<i>Mr. Lawrence.</i>
<i>Breaking and entering, are we?</i>

14:37.543 --> 14:38.752
<i>I don't know what your deal is,</i>

14:38.836 --> 14:43.257
but you keep your cars
and your cash away from my son.

14:43.340 --> 14:45.009
Prom is a special night.

14:45.509 --> 14:47.219
Did you even know he was going?

14:48.429 --> 14:52.474
Look, as long as Robby's with me,
I'm gonna take care of him.

14:52.558 --> 14:55.769
Oh, and I gotta say, Shannon?

14:56.687 --> 14:58.522
She is a special lady,

14:58.606 --> 15:00.608
<i>and deserves so much better.</i>

15:00.691 --> 15:02.610
Listen to me, you ancient piece of shit.

15:02.693 --> 15:06.447
<i>Whatever you and Kreese are up to,</i>
<i>I’ll kick both asses to the nursing home.</i>

15:08.073 --> 15:10.534
I would love to see you try.

15:11.285 --> 15:14.580
<i>Corner of Magnolia and Lankershim.</i>
<i>You know it well.</i>

15:23.672 --> 15:25.424
Hey, what are you up to?

15:41.273 --> 15:42.274
They're watching us.

15:44.485 --> 15:45.819
Let's put on a show then.

16:38.914 --> 16:39.999
Miguel.

16:40.082 --> 16:41.709
What? Um, sorry.

16:47.131 --> 16:49.800
So it's fair to say
you didn't consider the ramifications

16:49.883 --> 16:51.677
of giving him his own electronics.

16:51.760 --> 16:54.388
Would you say that
because of your demanding work schedules,

16:54.471 --> 16:56.056
and now the dojo,

16:56.140 --> 16:58.350
that Anthony may
have learned key life lessons

16:58.434 --> 17:01.353
from the Internet rather than from you?

17:01.437 --> 17:02.813
Um, I wouldn't go that far.

17:02.896 --> 17:05.065
I wouldn't… I mean… Um, no, I'm…

17:05.149 --> 17:09.987
Well, listen, I'm sure he's picked up
some things we didn't realize, but… no.

17:11.238 --> 17:15.409
Mm-hm. And when he picked up
these "things," as you call them,

17:15.492 --> 17:17.661
were you able to correct the behavior?

17:17.745 --> 17:20.497
Uh, look, we discipline
when it's appropriate.

17:20.581 --> 17:24.585
Yes. Always. I mean, too much even.

17:25.169 --> 17:27.629
-Hm.
-But not too, too much. Just…

17:28.464 --> 17:30.257
-Like a…
-Hm.

17:30.799 --> 17:32.384
Okay, I’m sorry,

17:32.468 --> 17:35.095
how many stones do you plan
on throwing from your glass house?

17:35.179 --> 17:38.057
I'm curious if you've ever taken care
of anything bigger than a goldfish.

17:38.140 --> 17:39.516
What are you writing?

17:39.600 --> 17:42.561
See, this reaction
is at the root of the problem.

17:42.644 --> 17:43.562
Excuse--

17:43.645 --> 17:44.813
You're acting out.

17:44.897 --> 17:48.067
No, no, we're just working through this.
We're not acting out.

17:48.150 --> 17:50.027
I can prove it with a simple test.

17:51.278 --> 17:53.822
Now, why do you think
you love your daughter more than your son?

17:54.323 --> 17:55.741
Wha…

17:56.533 --> 17:57.659
-Wha…
-Mm-hm.

17:59.578 --> 18:00.954
What? Give me that pad!

18:04.625 --> 18:05.751
You failed.

18:05.834 --> 18:07.169
Sorry. Nope.

18:10.380 --> 18:13.425
<i>It's been a long time</i>
<i>since this place has been a dojo.</i>

18:13.509 --> 18:15.177
They're putting it up for sale.

18:17.471 --> 18:19.014
I think it was a candle shop.

18:24.478 --> 18:26.814
This place was always good to us.

18:26.897 --> 18:27.981
And it will be again.

18:29.233 --> 18:30.984
After we win the All Valley.

18:31.652 --> 18:33.362
Going back to our roots.

18:33.445 --> 18:36.115
Right here. When it was just you and me.

18:37.074 --> 18:40.661
And I've got my agent looking
for other locations for when we expand.

18:41.745 --> 18:43.705
-Expand?
-That's right.

18:43.789 --> 18:47.084
I'm making our dream a reality.

18:48.001 --> 18:50.879
We're just one tournament victory away.

18:52.631 --> 18:55.717
Well, Terry, I can tell you,
as far as surprises go,

18:57.052 --> 18:58.512
this is a good one.

18:59.179 --> 19:01.056
This is not your only surprise.

19:05.060 --> 19:07.062
Tournament's coming up in a week.

19:07.146 --> 19:09.523
I'm with Eagle Fang Karate.
You may have heard of it.

19:09.606 --> 19:10.607
It's pretty badass.

19:11.441 --> 19:14.236
Bert. Hey, Bert. Psst. Bert.

19:16.113 --> 19:17.531
-I'll be right back.
-Mm-hm.

19:20.701 --> 19:21.535
Bert!

19:21.618 --> 19:24.163
-What are you doing here?
-Sorry, you scared me.

19:24.246 --> 19:27.207
I need your help, man.
I'm trying to rejoin Cobra Kai.

19:27.291 --> 19:28.876
I'm not in Cobra Kai anymore.

19:28.959 --> 19:29.918
What?

19:30.419 --> 19:33.380
I gotta get back.
The slow dance is when I make my move.

19:33.463 --> 19:36.717
Wait, I heard that you guys lost
your after-party pad. Is that true?

19:36.800 --> 19:37.634
Yeah. So?

19:38.135 --> 19:40.554
So Stingray's got a move for ya. My place.

19:40.637 --> 19:42.723
Come to 7010 Halbert.

19:42.806 --> 19:44.266
Tell everybody, okay?

19:52.774 --> 19:54.860
-You're a good dancer.
-Thank you.

19:56.069 --> 19:57.946
My, uh… My mom was a dancer.

20:00.032 --> 20:02.993
That wasn't an option for me.
I had to teach myself.

20:03.076 --> 20:04.286
You're still pretty good.

20:05.329 --> 20:07.581
You'd win a karate competition
before a dance one.

20:07.664 --> 20:08.624
I hope so.

20:11.919 --> 20:15.964
I mean, all these Encino kids
have their whole lives cut out for them.

20:16.798 --> 20:17.883
I'll never have that.

20:20.469 --> 20:22.471
But if I could just win this one time,

20:24.431 --> 20:27.226
I could look at that trophy
and know I was best at something.

20:29.478 --> 20:30.812
That's stupid.

20:33.815 --> 20:34.650
No, it's not.

20:36.944 --> 20:37.903
I mean, I get it.

20:48.664 --> 20:50.040
Are they still watching?

20:51.833 --> 20:52.709
I don't care.

20:56.505 --> 20:57.339
Me neither.

21:02.511 --> 21:04.846
-Sam.
-What?

21:26.034 --> 21:27.703
You brought me to the old dojo?

21:28.537 --> 21:29.371
Come on out.

21:38.130 --> 21:40.340
That’s what you get
for betraying your sensei.

21:40.424 --> 21:42.134
You got him to come here?

21:43.719 --> 21:45.095
I had to prove my loyalty.

21:45.595 --> 21:48.932
You wanted to get back at him, right?
Well, here’s your chance.

21:49.016 --> 21:50.976
What about focusing on the tournament?

21:51.059 --> 21:52.102
I am focused.

21:53.103 --> 21:56.148
The only way that loser has a shot
at winning the tournament

21:56.231 --> 21:57.524
is with the Diaz kid, right?

21:57.607 --> 22:01.403
How’s that kid’s confidence gonna be
when he sees his sensei beaten to a pulp?

22:02.279 --> 22:05.699
It’ll totally throw him off balance.
Just like your lesson.

22:06.199 --> 22:09.161
Unlike him,
I actually heed your lessons, Captain.

22:09.244 --> 22:11.079
-Hi-yah!

22:29.056 --> 22:29.973
Woo-hoo!

22:30.057 --> 22:33.643
You see this? Looks like
LaRusso taught him some defense.

22:34.144 --> 22:35.145
Okay, pretty boy.

22:35.645 --> 22:36.480
Let's go.

22:37.814 --> 22:39.107
Let's see what you learned.

22:51.953 --> 22:53.955
Guess you didn't learn much, huh?

22:55.916 --> 22:57.167
You wanna see some more?

22:59.461 --> 23:00.670
Let him go.

23:01.546 --> 23:02.464
Now.

23:04.800 --> 23:07.260
We agreed to settle this
at the tournament.

23:08.303 --> 23:10.097
And that's where we're gonna do it.

23:11.556 --> 23:13.016
What happened to "no mercy"?

23:15.769 --> 23:18.730
You know, I thought
you knew better than to question me.

23:19.523 --> 23:21.149
I thought this is what you wanted.

23:51.930 --> 23:54.850
Party time!

24:02.816 --> 24:04.151
-Ready for a refill?
-Yeah.

24:04.234 --> 24:05.068
Come on.

24:08.947 --> 24:10.282
I guess Moon's not coming.

24:13.493 --> 24:15.203
I'm sorry. Did you say something?

24:15.287 --> 24:18.123
Come on,
let's check out the rest of the house.

24:19.082 --> 24:20.709
-I'll race ya!

24:23.378 --> 24:25.505
No more hard stuff for me.
I learned my lesson.

24:25.589 --> 24:28.925
-I'm just gonna grab a beer.
-Okay. Grab me one too. I'll find snacks.

24:39.186 --> 24:43.523
Whoa! The day the music died.
What's going on? Guys, turn it back on.

24:44.024 --> 24:47.777
There are families on this street
trying to get some sleep.

24:47.861 --> 24:50.280
If y'all don't go home right now,

24:50.363 --> 24:52.949
you are gonna get arrested
for underage drinking.

24:53.033 --> 24:54.451
Okay, relax. Hey, guys!

24:54.534 --> 24:58.371
Hey, hey! You don't have to leave!
It's fine. He's my neighbor. Hey.

24:58.455 --> 25:00.499
What are you doing here?
You weren't invited.

25:00.582 --> 25:02.584
You should leave right now.

25:02.667 --> 25:06.254
Okay, no one listen
to this speed bump of a human.

25:06.338 --> 25:08.757
This is a loser, everyone.

25:10.008 --> 25:15.013
That's why he's partying with you,
because he has no friends his own age.

25:21.061 --> 25:21.895
Okay.

25:22.812 --> 25:23.730
I warned you,

25:24.606 --> 25:27.025
but you just had to push it
and make it personal.

25:27.108 --> 25:28.777
I did, Stink-Ray.

25:28.860 --> 25:30.820
And you know what I'm doing right now?

25:30.904 --> 25:34.407
I'm gonna start pushing these buttons
and I am gonna call the cops. Ow!

25:34.491 --> 25:35.575
It's not Stink-Ray.

25:39.120 --> 25:41.957
Also, this is really gonna sting.

25:43.792 --> 25:44.626
So's this.

25:44.709 --> 25:47.295
Oh!

25:47.379 --> 25:48.588
Did you see that?

25:49.923 --> 25:50.924
Party on.

25:53.051 --> 25:57.305
Stingray, Stingray,
Stingray, Stingray, Stingray!

25:57.389 --> 26:03.937
Stingray, Stingray, Stingray,
Stingray, Stingray, Stingray, Stingray!

26:16.741 --> 26:17.576
Hey.

26:18.618 --> 26:22.706
Look, I know this suspension
and the no screens thing sucks.

26:24.583 --> 26:26.793
But not as much as it sucks to be bullied.

26:27.502 --> 26:30.672
So I hope you understand
why these consequences are necessary.

26:32.173 --> 26:35.927
We're trying to help you to grow
into the person we know you are, Anthony.

26:36.595 --> 26:39.889
I know it's been crazy around here
this last little while and that part,

26:41.433 --> 26:42.475
that's on me.

26:43.768 --> 26:47.397
This tournament stuff made me lose focus
on the things that are most important.

26:47.480 --> 26:50.317
Actually, I'm, uh…
I'm looking forward to the tournament.

26:51.234 --> 26:53.903
You know, I hope you guys win.
Okay? Screw Cobra Kai.

26:56.781 --> 26:57.616
Well,

26:58.658 --> 27:00.076
on that we can agree.

27:03.330 --> 27:04.331
What is that?

27:07.667 --> 27:09.044
We said no more screens.

27:09.127 --> 27:11.421
Are you hearing
anything we’re saying to you?

27:11.504 --> 27:12.589
Give me that, Anthony.

27:13.423 --> 27:16.384
It’s not even an iPad.
It barely has games. This doesn’t count!

27:16.468 --> 27:18.803
-Dad, are you insane? Do you know--
-Quiet!

27:19.888 --> 27:23.266
You're gonna learn to listen to us
and do as you're told, and if you don't,

27:23.350 --> 27:25.769
you'd better strap yourself in
for a rough ride

27:25.852 --> 27:28.229
because I am done playing games with you.

27:28.772 --> 27:29.856
Do you understand me?

27:32.817 --> 27:33.652
Yes.

27:34.903 --> 27:35.779
You better.

27:54.923 --> 27:57.175
Seems like
you’re always behind me in line.

27:57.258 --> 27:58.718
First Miguel, now Robby.

27:58.802 --> 28:00.804
I have a half-eaten cupcake
if you want some.

28:00.887 --> 28:05.642
You know, I’d kick your ass,
but I promised your mom that I wouldn’t.

28:06.226 --> 28:08.019
Stay the hell away from my family.

28:08.645 --> 28:09.479
Sorry.

28:10.855 --> 28:13.149
I don't take orders
from tiny, little bitches.

28:29.916 --> 28:31.710
-Sam, stop!

28:32.293 --> 28:33.586
What are you doing?

28:33.670 --> 28:35.880
What Johnny said!
Not taking her shit anymore!

28:36.381 --> 28:38.758
-No!
-Get off of me!

28:43.680 --> 28:44.973
-No!
-Let me go!

28:45.056 --> 28:47.183
-Get off her!
-Stop!

28:51.438 --> 28:53.606
-You think I broke your heart?

28:53.690 --> 28:54.733
You broke mine too!

28:57.026 --> 28:59.237
Oh!

29:23.762 --> 29:25.305
You think my dad cares about you?

29:25.388 --> 29:27.891
He’s trying to feel better
for screwing up with me!

29:35.565 --> 29:37.400
Oh, we're jumping in the pool?

29:40.570 --> 29:43.198
This is the greatest night of my life!

29:43.281 --> 29:44.908
Cannonball!

29:53.166 --> 29:56.211
Wow, you managed to stay dry.
Can you help me out?

30:05.220 --> 30:06.262
What was that?

30:06.346 --> 30:08.807
Tonight was supposed to be
for you and me. You ruined it!

30:08.890 --> 30:13.436
What? What? Why are you taking her side?
Same reason you've been staring at her?

30:13.520 --> 30:16.272
Let's not talk about
the moment you had with Robby, huh?

30:16.356 --> 30:17.357
I wanna go home.

30:17.857 --> 30:18.691
Me too.

30:23.029 --> 30:26.199
Sensei, you got a second to talk?
I've been having a real rough night.

30:26.282 --> 30:27.116
You around?

30:27.200 --> 30:28.910
-Oh shit.

30:29.494 --> 30:30.328
Not again.

30:31.037 --> 30:31.871
Sensei!

30:33.957 --> 30:35.792
Oh, come inside, come inside.

30:36.584 --> 30:37.961
Okay.

30:39.170 --> 30:42.465
-What happened? Why'd you drink so much?
-Old man can kick.

30:42.966 --> 30:46.219
I don't know what that means.
Let's get you up. Come on.

31:06.030 --> 31:06.865
Oh.

31:07.949 --> 31:10.493
-Put your legs up. There you go.

31:10.577 --> 31:11.411
Okay.

31:12.745 --> 31:13.580
Okay.

31:15.206 --> 31:17.125
Hey, hey, hey! No, no, no!

31:17.208 --> 31:19.377
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-You're fine. I was already wet.

31:19.460 --> 31:20.628
-Me too.
-Okay.

31:20.712 --> 31:21.921
From pee.

31:23.214 --> 31:24.173
Gross.

31:24.257 --> 31:26.509
Okay. Look, um, you're good here.

31:26.593 --> 31:28.678
I'm going to bed.
We can talk in the morning.

31:28.761 --> 31:30.221
Wait, wait, listen, listen.

31:32.015 --> 31:33.766
I want… I wanna be a father to you.

31:34.434 --> 31:35.435
I really do.

31:36.936 --> 31:38.187
I try to protect you.

31:38.938 --> 31:41.983
I try to be there for you.
I just suck at it. I really suck at it.

31:43.693 --> 31:45.069
But I want to so bad.

31:51.117 --> 31:52.285
You're doing just fine.

31:56.497 --> 31:57.332
I love you.

31:59.375 --> 32:02.170
I love you too, Robby.

32:24.484 --> 32:27.320
That hook kick was awesome.
Did you throw that blind?

32:27.403 --> 32:28.988
I could throw that in my sleep.

32:30.990 --> 32:34.285
But I think the highlight of my night
was still your dance moves.

32:34.369 --> 32:37.956
Thanks. It's a good thing
we practiced that twirl, it came in handy.

32:38.039 --> 32:40.667
I can’t believe
Sensei Silver let us borrow this car.

32:40.750 --> 32:41.584
Yeah, I know.

32:43.044 --> 32:44.754
Gotta return it tomorrow, though, so…

32:45.755 --> 32:46.756
Same with this.

32:48.257 --> 32:50.009
Nice!

32:50.093 --> 32:52.679
-Hopefully, it's all dry by then.

33:00.520 --> 33:02.355
I guess we should get our money's worth.

33:35.513 --> 33:38.516
-Hey, see Sam yet?
-No, she’s still conked out in her room.

33:38.599 --> 33:39.475
Hm.

33:42.979 --> 33:43.813
Anthony?

33:45.189 --> 33:46.274
What are you doing?

33:47.692 --> 33:49.652
I was just, uh, taking out the trash.

33:50.153 --> 33:52.196
You're just taking out the trash?

33:53.072 --> 33:54.240
Without anybody asking?

33:54.782 --> 33:57.201
For the first time in your whole life?

33:57.285 --> 33:58.453
Listen, I, uh…

34:00.038 --> 34:01.539
I screwed up, okay?

34:01.622 --> 34:05.001
I did some dumb things to that kid
and it went way too far.

34:06.044 --> 34:08.921
Okay? And…
And I really do feel bad about it.

34:09.005 --> 34:12.341
I heard what you said, Dad,
and, you know, maybe I could help out,

34:12.425 --> 34:14.761
you know, in the dealership
or hang out in the dojo again,

34:14.844 --> 34:16.179
if-if that’s cool?

34:17.180 --> 34:18.765
Yeah, well, that's, um…

34:20.266 --> 34:21.225
That would be cool.

34:26.064 --> 34:29.150
Well, I don't know what kind
of Miyagi magic you pulled, but

34:30.985 --> 34:31.861
it worked.

34:38.910 --> 34:39.911
Questioning you?

34:41.287 --> 34:44.791
Questioning you? No mercy.

34:45.500 --> 34:47.460
Bullshit. I proved my loyalty.

34:52.173 --> 34:54.759
Oh! Hey, hey, hey! Mr. Vice Sensei.

34:55.343 --> 34:58.012
How goes it? Ooh, is that a Technogym?

34:58.096 --> 35:00.598
I think Dwayne Johnson
has one of those in his bathroom.

35:00.681 --> 35:02.517
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

35:04.227 --> 35:06.270
Sensei Kreese was clear. Get the hell out.

35:06.354 --> 35:09.816
I don't mean to be disrespectful,
but I think he's incorrect.

35:09.899 --> 35:13.402
You ask any of the students here,
uh, what they think of Stingray,

35:13.486 --> 35:15.363
and th-they want me on the team, sir.

35:20.326 --> 35:21.994
So you wanna be Cobra Kai?

35:23.371 --> 35:24.413
Yes, Sensei.

35:25.081 --> 35:27.041
I've already proven myself to my peers,

35:27.125 --> 35:29.502
but now I'm gonna
prove myself to you, sir.

35:31.712 --> 35:32.880
How bad do you want it?

35:34.090 --> 35:38.386
I want it more than anything else in
the world, sir. It's literally all I want.

35:38.469 --> 35:41.264
It's all I think about.
I-I'll do anything, please.

35:42.431 --> 35:44.517
You wanna be Cobra Kai?

35:45.518 --> 35:47.812
Ooh. So you wanna be Cobra Kai, huh?

35:54.193 --> 35:55.695
You wanna be Cobra Kai?

35:58.531 --> 36:00.491
-You wanna be Cobra Kai?

36:04.245 --> 36:06.289
You wanna be Cobra Kai?
