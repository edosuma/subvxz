WEBVTT

00:11.485 --> 00:13.325
I just can't get my head around it.

00:14.125 --> 00:17.285
The fact that he's gone... forever.

00:17.365 --> 00:20.165
It's so sad, it really is.
It is so, so sad.

00:20.245 --> 00:22.725
But at the same time,
what's done is done, so let's crack on.

00:22.805 --> 00:24.485
Well, I'm sorry, Clare.

00:24.565 --> 00:28.125
Has his sudden, tragic death
interrupted your studies?

00:28.205 --> 00:29.485
It has a bit, actually, yeah.

00:30.765 --> 00:33.645
- How can you be so heartless?
- Don't cry, Erin.

00:33.725 --> 00:35.965
He's in a better place now.

00:36.045 --> 00:39.405
Unless he's not, you know,
because unless he's gone to hell.

00:39.485 --> 00:42.725
Can we please talk about something else?
I'm half torn. This is wrecking my head.

00:42.805 --> 00:45.645
- What? Have you been drinking?
- Yes, I have.

00:46.165 --> 00:50.045
And for future reference, if any of you
invite me to a study sleepover again,

00:50.125 --> 00:52.325
and I'm desperate enough
to accept that invitation,

00:52.405 --> 00:55.325
there's a good chance I'll have
a liter bottle of Pernod in my bag.

00:55.405 --> 00:57.405
I shouldn't even have to sit the exam,

00:57.485 --> 01:01.645
- on, you know, compassionate grounds.
- He was a dog, Erin!

01:01.725 --> 01:04.165
Toto was much more than a dog.

01:04.245 --> 01:06.245
Toto was my best friend.

01:06.325 --> 01:07.765
Christ, I feel a bit bokey.

01:12.685 --> 01:16.725
Sweet suffering Jesus. It's the morning
already?! What are we going to do?

01:16.805 --> 01:18.925
Maybe we could start
with calming the fuck down.

01:19.005 --> 01:20.205
Calm down?

01:20.285 --> 01:23.565
We're still on William of Orange!
We haven't so much looked at the famine!

01:23.645 --> 01:26.285
We've got the gist. They ran out of spuds,
everyone was raging.

01:26.365 --> 01:29.285
Well, I can't tell
my rebellions from my risings.

01:29.365 --> 01:33.245
Whose fault's that? If your lot stopped
invading us for five fucking minutes,

01:33.325 --> 01:35.845
there'd be a lot less to wade through,
you English prick.

01:35.925 --> 01:37.885
Nothing's going in.

01:37.965 --> 01:40.605
Nothing is going in,
and every time I try to make notes it...

01:42.485 --> 01:44.285
What's happening to me?

01:44.365 --> 01:46.845
There's quite a lot of caffeine in those,
Clare.

01:46.925 --> 01:50.205
- How many of them have you had?
- I don't know. Five? Twenty-three?

01:51.245 --> 01:54.405
We are all so fucked.

02:00.285 --> 02:02.645
Now, more bacon, anyone?
Another sausage?

02:02.725 --> 02:04.845
Wee omelet, maybe? Anything at all.

02:04.925 --> 02:06.685
It's absolutely no bother.

02:06.765 --> 02:09.205
- I'll have a cup of tea, Joe.
- Make your own tea.

02:09.884 --> 02:11.405
Yeah, I'll do that.

02:13.045 --> 02:16.125
- You stay over, too, son?
- Yes, I did. That's correct, sir.

02:16.685 --> 02:17.925
What, in your room?

02:19.125 --> 02:22.005
Have you nothing to say about this,
you slack southern shite?

02:22.085 --> 02:25.045
- Look, love, I know the fella's gay...
- I'm not gay.

02:25.125 --> 02:28.165
- ...but gay or not, he's still a fella.
- Who said I was gay?

02:28.965 --> 02:31.285
There's still a good chance
that he's a rapist.

02:31.365 --> 02:33.765
I mean no offense, son.

02:33.845 --> 02:36.605
- Well, that's that done.
- God rest his wee soul.

02:36.685 --> 02:39.565
Ach, don't talk to me.

02:39.645 --> 02:41.245
I was in bits last night.

02:41.325 --> 02:43.845
Didn't even manage my Chinese.

02:43.925 --> 02:46.005
Poor Tonto.

02:46.085 --> 02:47.285
Toto.

02:47.365 --> 02:48.845
His name was Toto, Aunt Sarah.

02:48.925 --> 02:52.765
Aye, nightmare, so it is.
Da, do us a bacon butty, would you?

02:52.845 --> 02:55.725
- My stomach thinks my throat's cut here.
- Surely, love.

02:55.805 --> 02:58.525
Jesus, the pets are getting it left,
right and center at the minute.

02:58.605 --> 03:01.045
Maureen Malarkey's Tigger passed away.

03:01.085 --> 03:03.045
We do not utter
that woman's name in this house.

03:03.125 --> 03:05.245
Ach, Da, not the bingo thing still.

03:05.325 --> 03:06.565
She's a cheating old bitch.

03:06.645 --> 03:08.165
How can you cheat at bingo, Granda?

03:08.245 --> 03:10.925
Her nephew brought her this pen
back from New Jersey.

03:11.005 --> 03:14.605
It changes the numbers.
I'm telling you, It's witchcraft, Mary.

03:14.685 --> 03:16.925
We'll hear no more about the magic pen.

03:17.525 --> 03:20.605
Now come on, girls, eat up. You'll need
all your energy for the big exam.

03:20.685 --> 03:23.445
We'll need a miracle
for the big exam.

03:24.325 --> 03:26.925
Mammy, what happened to Toto...

03:27.965 --> 03:30.285
it's just hit me so hard,

03:31.005 --> 03:35.205
and I'm worried
it might affect my performance.

03:36.245 --> 03:37.245
Come here, love.

03:40.605 --> 03:43.085
Look, if you fail the exam, I promise you,

03:43.845 --> 03:46.445
there'll be a nice wee plot
out there with your name on it.

03:48.805 --> 03:50.085
It's abuse.

03:50.165 --> 03:52.405
That's what it is.
It's abusive.

03:52.485 --> 03:55.645
Does anybody have 10p?
I'm ringing Childline.

03:55.725 --> 03:58.701
You can't ring Childline every
time your ma threatens to kill you, Erin.

03:58.725 --> 04:00.965
Yeah, you can't waste
Esther's time like that.

04:01.045 --> 04:03.565
And anyway, you're not alone.
We're all going to fail.

04:03.645 --> 04:06.645
We're all going to get our holes kicked,
and we are all in the same boat.

04:06.725 --> 04:08.005
I don't want to be in that boat.

04:08.085 --> 04:11.125
I want to be in a different boat,
sailing down a totally different river.

04:11.205 --> 04:13.245
Guys, all we can do is try our best.

04:13.325 --> 04:15.845
- Ach, don't be such a fruit, James.
- Oh, my God, look.

04:17.605 --> 04:19.725
Doesn't that dog look like Toto?

04:19.805 --> 04:21.964
I suppose it does a bit, yeah.

04:22.045 --> 04:23.485
Looks exactly like him.

04:24.085 --> 04:25.085
Here, boy!

04:26.285 --> 04:28.205
Come here, boy! Here, boy!

04:28.285 --> 04:30.805
Come here, boy! Here, boy!
Come here!

04:30.885 --> 04:33.045
Here, boy! Here, boy!

04:33.565 --> 04:34.765
What are we doing?

04:34.845 --> 04:37.325
- Don't know. I'm still pished.
- Aye!

04:37.405 --> 04:39.965
- We're going to be late, Erin!
- But it's freaky.

04:40.045 --> 04:41.725
Don't you think it's so freaky?

04:41.805 --> 04:44.645
No! It's just a dog
that looks a bit like another dog.

04:44.725 --> 04:46.765
Quick! Come on!

04:48.000 --> 04:54.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:57.725 --> 04:59.045
Where did he go?

04:59.125 --> 05:00.605
I don't really give a flying fuck.

05:00.685 --> 05:01.845
Listen, you.

05:02.885 --> 05:04.205
Yes, Mrs. Malarkey?

05:04.285 --> 05:08.205
You give that grandfather
of yours a message from me.

05:09.445 --> 05:13.765
You tell him to keep
his bloody mouth shut about my pen!

05:13.845 --> 05:16.765
Okay.

05:20.285 --> 05:22.765
And I want my baking tray back!

05:26.925 --> 05:29.205
Of course.
Trying to butter up the big woman.

05:29.285 --> 05:33.125
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is
with thee. Blessed art thou among...

05:33.205 --> 05:36.245
- Oh, now you'll definitely pass.
- It was worth a try!

05:36.325 --> 05:37.565
Aye.

05:40.485 --> 05:43.365
I'm not going to bother with
any "never sin again" material,

05:43.445 --> 05:45.565
because let's face it,
we've been there before.

05:45.645 --> 05:47.525
You know it's balls. I know it's balls.

05:48.845 --> 05:50.525
Oh, my God.

05:50.605 --> 05:53.045
- What is it?
- She... she...

05:53.765 --> 05:55.445
I saw with my own eyes.

05:55.565 --> 05:58.405
- Saw what?
- She smirked!

05:58.485 --> 06:00.485
- Who, big M?
- Aye.

06:00.565 --> 06:01.765
She just smirked at me.

06:01.845 --> 06:03.165
Are you sure you didn't just...

06:03.245 --> 06:05.445
Jesus! Me, too.

06:05.525 --> 06:07.005
She just smirked at me, too.

06:07.565 --> 06:11.045
- Why isn't she smirking at me?
- She isn't smirking at anyone, James.

06:11.125 --> 06:12.205
I just saw it, too!

06:12.885 --> 06:16.085
- The holy smirk, thanks be to God.
- You're imagining it.

06:16.165 --> 06:18.061
Three of us saw it, Erin.
How do you explain that?

06:18.085 --> 06:19.805
Sleep deprivation.

06:19.885 --> 06:21.285
Pernod.

06:21.365 --> 06:25.485
Delusional personality disorder.

06:25.565 --> 06:26.765
There you are.

06:29.605 --> 06:31.645
Here, boy! Here, boy!

06:37.205 --> 06:39.205
I mean, it's uncanny.

06:39.645 --> 06:41.725
Okay, let's do it together.

06:41.805 --> 06:42.805
Everyone look away.

06:43.445 --> 06:44.885
Right. So, on three...

06:46.125 --> 06:47.205
One...

06:47.285 --> 06:48.765
No, no, no, no.

06:49.525 --> 06:53.525
- Two...
- I mean, have a bit of respect.

06:53.605 --> 06:55.405
Three.

06:55.485 --> 06:58.525
No way.

06:58.605 --> 07:00.205
What now?

07:03.325 --> 07:04.605
She's crying.

07:05.765 --> 07:07.725
She's crying real tears.

07:09.405 --> 07:13.725
Oh, God, please. Oh, God, no, this is bad.

07:13.805 --> 07:17.205
I said we needed a miracle,
and behold, we have been given one.

07:17.285 --> 07:19.605
This isn't a miracle, Clare.

07:19.685 --> 07:21.845
- The exam, Erin.
- Fuck the exam. Sorry.

07:21.925 --> 07:24.005
- Listen... the thing is...
- This is huge, Clare.

07:24.085 --> 07:27.045
Do you really think they're going
to make us sit an exam after seeing this?

07:28.725 --> 07:31.325
- You may have a point.
- Of course I have a point.

07:32.045 --> 07:34.685
We are the motherfucking children
of Fatima, people.

07:39.925 --> 07:42.925
Could you put me through
to Sister Thomas, please?

07:43.445 --> 07:45.605
Tommy!

07:45.685 --> 07:47.445
How are you?

07:47.525 --> 07:49.085
Yeah, not too bad.

07:49.765 --> 07:50.925
On retreat?

07:51.645 --> 07:53.365
Tsk. I don't know.

07:54.245 --> 07:56.005
I have judo on Friday.
Don't like to miss it.

07:57.085 --> 07:58.525
Now, I tell you why I'm ringing you.

07:59.445 --> 08:02.245
So, we've had an alleged apparition here
this morning.

08:03.125 --> 08:06.525
Well, it's in the weeping statue category.

08:07.565 --> 08:08.565
Sure, I know.

08:09.085 --> 08:11.325
Yeah, apparently there was a smirk
as well.

08:11.405 --> 08:14.605
I mean, I'm not sure
what Our Lady of the Sorrows

08:14.685 --> 08:16.501
has to be smirking about,
but that's by the by.

08:16.525 --> 08:19.605
- Sister, priest is here.
- I'll call you back.

08:22.765 --> 08:24.285
Just a moment, ladies.

08:28.645 --> 08:31.125
Listen, girls,
I didn't really think beyond the exam,

08:31.205 --> 08:32.684
or us getting out of doing it.

08:32.765 --> 08:34.125
Before this goes any further,

08:34.205 --> 08:36.924
before we talk to this priest,
there is something you need to know.

08:37.005 --> 08:39.125
Come in, Father.

08:46.565 --> 08:50.125
<i>♪ Do you, do you, do you
Do you see the light? ♪</i>

08:50.205 --> 08:52.005
<i>♪ Do you, do you, do you ♪</i>

08:52.085 --> 08:54.445
Fuck me.

08:54.525 --> 08:57.165
I like his shiny hair.

08:57.245 --> 09:00.925
So do I. I really like his shiny hair.

09:01.005 --> 09:03.445
- What were you saying, Erin?
- Nothing. Ignore me. Forget it.

09:04.165 --> 09:05.205
Hello, children.

09:05.285 --> 09:07.205
Hello, Father.

09:07.285 --> 09:09.125
Please, call me Peter.

09:09.205 --> 09:10.845
Christ.

09:11.365 --> 09:14.005
This is just going to be a very relaxed,
informal chat.

09:14.085 --> 09:17.805
I don't want you to think of me
as a priest. Think of me as a friend.

09:18.805 --> 09:20.085
Look.

09:22.205 --> 09:24.245
Just like you now.

09:24.325 --> 09:25.645
Dose.

09:25.725 --> 09:27.325
So, before we begin,

09:27.405 --> 09:29.005
do you guys have any questions for me?

09:29.605 --> 09:32.205
Is that your real eye color
or are they contacts?

09:32.285 --> 09:33.645
These are my real eyes.

09:33.725 --> 09:35.605
- Oh.
- Anyone else?

09:35.685 --> 09:36.685
Yes, James.

09:36.765 --> 09:40.005
- Is that a firm hold gel you're using?
- It's a mousse.

09:40.845 --> 09:42.525
- And where do you...
- Hair and Flair.

09:42.605 --> 09:45.245
- Oh, I didn't realize... Ah...
- They do a men's range.

09:45.805 --> 09:48.965
- Anyone else?
- Have you ever done any modeling?

09:49.045 --> 09:50.045
No.

09:51.685 --> 09:53.205
Does anyone have any questions about

09:53.285 --> 09:56.485
- what happened in the church this morning?
- No, I don't think so.

09:56.565 --> 09:57.565
- No.
- No.

09:57.645 --> 09:58.645
- Not really.
- No.

09:58.725 --> 10:00.445
Okay, then. So you claim you saw

10:00.525 --> 10:03.125
our Blessed Lady's features change.
Is that right?

10:03.325 --> 10:06.405
The Virgin Mother smirked at us, Peter.
That is correct.

10:06.485 --> 10:08.725
I see. And after that,

10:08.805 --> 10:11.285
the statue, well,
you claim it started weeping.

10:11.365 --> 10:14.045
You're using the word "claim"
a lot there, Peter.

10:14.125 --> 10:16.165
Girls, I'm not here to make any judgments.

10:16.245 --> 10:18.605
- I'm just trying to get the truth.
- You think we're lying?

10:18.685 --> 10:20.485
- No, of course not.
- I do.

10:20.565 --> 10:23.005
But sometimes we want to believe in
something so much

10:23.085 --> 10:24.525
that we willingly deceive ourselves.

10:24.605 --> 10:26.685
I know I've been guilty
of that in the past.

10:26.765 --> 10:29.285
I wanted a sign so badly
that it drove me to distraction,

10:29.365 --> 10:33.605
because it is the question
we all want the answer to, isn't it?

10:33.685 --> 10:35.405
I mean, does God exist?

10:36.725 --> 10:37.965
I mean, does he exist?

10:41.885 --> 10:43.325
Does he?

10:46.205 --> 10:48.605
Or is your whole world built on a lie,
Peter?

10:53.045 --> 10:55.045
- Peter?
- Yeah.

10:58.245 --> 11:00.045
Directly before the weeping,

11:00.125 --> 11:03.645
can you remember what you were doing,
what you were talking about?

11:03.725 --> 11:05.965
- I remember that James was being a dick.
- Miss Mallon.

11:06.445 --> 11:09.845
I don't like to use that word, Sister,
but it's so hard to describe James

11:09.925 --> 11:12.085
any other way because
he's just such a dick.

11:13.285 --> 11:15.405
I don't think you're a dick,
James.

11:15.485 --> 11:17.125
- Really?
- Really.

11:17.205 --> 11:19.525
And do you know who else
doesn't think you're a dick?

11:20.245 --> 11:22.565
- Our Lord.
- For feck's sake.

11:22.645 --> 11:25.725
- How do you know Our Lord doesn't?
- Our Lord doesn't think anyone's a dick.

11:25.805 --> 11:28.405
- I very much doubt that.
- Well, it's the truth.

11:31.245 --> 11:32.645
- Marti Pellow.
- No.

11:32.725 --> 11:34.165
- Paddy Ashdown.
- No.

11:34.245 --> 11:35.925
- Your man from <i> Fun House.</i>
- Pat Sharp?

11:36.005 --> 11:37.845
Pat Sharp. Pat Sharp's definitely a dick.

11:37.925 --> 11:42.565
Okay. The five of you attending chapel,
praying together,

11:42.645 --> 11:45.365
- would that be a typical morning?
- Very good.

11:46.285 --> 11:49.525
- He's not joking, Michelle.
- Oh. Christ, fuck no.

11:49.605 --> 11:52.485
- We were just following that stupid dog.
- I'm sorry?

11:52.565 --> 11:54.645
The dog has nothing to do with anything.

11:54.725 --> 11:57.965
See, Erin's dog died recently, and she saw
one that sort of looked like him a bit.

11:58.005 --> 12:00.885
- The dog's irrelevant.
- So we followed him for a while.

12:00.965 --> 12:03.485
The dog and statue are unrelated.

12:03.565 --> 12:05.645
And he led us to the chapel.

12:06.205 --> 12:07.925
The dog led you to the chapel?

12:08.685 --> 12:10.405
- The dog isn't important.
- Maybe it is.

12:12.245 --> 12:14.285
What if this dog you saw, Erin,

12:14.365 --> 12:16.485
what if it didn't simply
look like your dog?

12:17.245 --> 12:19.205
What if it actually was your dog?

12:21.005 --> 12:22.445
Right.

12:22.525 --> 12:27.445
Maybe. But, as I think we mentioned,
Toto's dead.

12:27.525 --> 12:29.765
My ma saw him get hit
by an army Land Rover,

12:29.845 --> 12:32.685
and then buried him in our back garden,
so probably not.

12:33.565 --> 12:37.525
A beloved animal returning from the dead.
Now, we've seen this before.

12:37.605 --> 12:39.645
Oh, ghost dog.

12:39.725 --> 12:41.165
No, not ghost dog...

12:42.365 --> 12:43.805
resurrected dog.

12:45.445 --> 12:46.725
Don't you see?

12:47.285 --> 12:49.605
Toto was sent back
to lead you to that chapel,

12:49.685 --> 12:52.965
to that statue...
because you're special, Erin.

12:56.005 --> 12:57.605
You have been chosen.

13:00.205 --> 13:03.725
Oh, Peter, it's all just so overwhelming.

13:05.205 --> 13:06.605
Hmm.

13:09.285 --> 13:11.245
Here's what I find strange.

13:11.325 --> 13:13.885
You're in that chapel every single Sunday,

13:13.965 --> 13:18.165
yet this message from on high comes on
the very day you happen to have an exam,

13:18.245 --> 13:21.725
which, I know for a fact, you haven't
as much as even opened a book for.

13:21.805 --> 13:25.445
I find that very strange as well,
Mrs. Quinn. Very strange indeed.

13:25.525 --> 13:27.165
What are you suggesting?

13:27.245 --> 13:29.485
If you are lying, Erin,
so help me Jesus...

13:29.565 --> 13:30.965
I'm not lying.

13:31.045 --> 13:32.245
Swear.

13:32.325 --> 13:33.605
Swear on Dolly.

13:34.725 --> 13:36.205
- Orla saw too.
- Orla is easily led.

13:36.285 --> 13:37.725
Thank you, Aunt Mary.

13:37.805 --> 13:39.885
Look, I'm sure you all
must have questions.

13:39.965 --> 13:43.285
- I have a question.
- Yes?

13:43.365 --> 13:46.245
How do you stay in such good shape?

13:46.325 --> 13:49.645
- Is it exercise? Diet?
- A combination of both.

13:50.445 --> 13:52.765
I also have a question, pretty boy.

13:52.845 --> 13:54.645
Why are you encouraging all this?

13:54.725 --> 13:57.725
I wouldn't say I'm encouraging it.
I'm just open to the possibility.

13:57.805 --> 14:01.325
Well, I'm not, not unless I see
some cold, hard evidence.

14:01.405 --> 14:02.485
And maybe it's there.

14:03.085 --> 14:05.685
Proof at last, Peter. Proof at last.

14:07.405 --> 14:08.245
Is he all right?

14:08.325 --> 14:10.285
I wouldn't say so, no.

14:10.365 --> 14:11.365
He's a priest, like.

14:11.445 --> 14:15.405
Why seek ye the living among the dead?
He is not here but is risen.

14:15.485 --> 14:18.845
Come, come see the place
where the Lord lay.

14:20.365 --> 14:22.205
God is inviting us to be his witness.

14:23.205 --> 14:25.845
- We must look in the burial place.
- What's he saying?

14:25.925 --> 14:29.325
I think he's saying he wants to dig up
the wee dead dog's grave.

14:29.405 --> 14:30.485
- What?
- What?

14:30.565 --> 14:31.805
Fecking weirdo.

14:31.885 --> 14:34.365
I'll go. I'll get it.

14:38.965 --> 14:42.245
It is mental out there.
Everybody is talking about us.

14:42.325 --> 14:46.405
Dennis gave me free pick and mix,
bonbons and all. No fucking about, like.

14:46.485 --> 14:48.965
We're basically celebrities now.
We're like the Corrs.

14:49.045 --> 14:51.125
- Can I be Jim?
- It's too much, Erin.

14:51.205 --> 14:53.445
I can't handle it.
I think I'm going to crack.

14:53.525 --> 14:57.245
Okay, look, this has got way out of hand.
What are you wearing?

14:58.165 --> 15:00.325
What did I say?
You look like a fucking ball bag.

15:00.405 --> 15:01.885
Your hair's all funny.

15:01.965 --> 15:04.645
- I put too much mousse in it, that's all.
- Listen, girls...

15:04.725 --> 15:05.845
- Get off me.
- Okay, listen.

15:06.725 --> 15:09.085
- It was piss.
- What was?

15:09.165 --> 15:10.645
The tears on the statue.

15:10.725 --> 15:14.605
Well, I actually have good reason
to believe they were actually dog piss.

15:14.685 --> 15:16.485
No, you're not serious.

15:16.565 --> 15:17.565
Deadly serious.

15:17.645 --> 15:19.565
Sweet and gentle Jesus.

15:19.645 --> 15:22.245
I mean, that sort of makes sense.

15:22.325 --> 15:25.645
I'm not even sure I saw her smirk anymore.
I've had a lot of caffeine.

15:25.725 --> 15:27.845
I definitely didn't see her smirk.
I was lying, so...

15:27.925 --> 15:29.005
Excellent.

15:29.085 --> 15:31.805
I was going to tell you all earlier,
but then Peter showed up,

15:31.885 --> 15:35.405
and there was just this instant
connection, like a spark.

15:35.485 --> 15:37.501
- There was no spark, Erin.
- He said I was special.

15:37.525 --> 15:40.885
He also said your dead pet had been
fucking resurrected, so, pinch of salt.

15:40.965 --> 15:43.805
Yes, and now he's talking about
digging him up.

15:43.885 --> 15:48.645
And when he does, he'll realize that Toto
has not, in fact, been resurrected.

15:48.725 --> 15:52.125
He'll realize that Toto is just dead.
Very, very dead.

15:52.205 --> 15:55.085
- And we've all been talking shite.
- We need to tell the truth, now.

15:55.165 --> 15:57.765
No fucking way. This is the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

15:58.405 --> 15:59.485
Look, Clare.

16:00.245 --> 16:02.005
Take a long, hard look at that.

16:03.125 --> 16:06.285
And this is only the beginning.
The <i> Derry Journal </i> are on their way round.

16:06.365 --> 16:07.925
They said we could make page five.

16:08.005 --> 16:09.165
Erin, tell her!

16:10.285 --> 16:13.445
Yeah, we could tell the truth,
but I sort of like the fact

16:13.525 --> 16:15.845
that Peter thinks
I'm the chosen one, so...

16:15.925 --> 16:18.125
- James.
- I have a slight concern.

16:18.205 --> 16:19.525
The truth might affect

16:19.605 --> 16:22.061
- my friendship with Peter.
- You don't have a friendship with Peter.

16:22.085 --> 16:24.005
Yes, I do. We have a lot in common.

16:24.085 --> 16:26.485
Like what? Apart from you appear
to be wearing his clothes.

16:26.565 --> 16:30.045
No, the fact that we're both
very spiritual.

16:30.645 --> 16:33.205
But mainly the fact
that he doesn't think I'm a dick,

16:33.285 --> 16:34.445
and neither do I.

16:35.325 --> 16:37.485
Come on, people! The jig is up!

16:40.045 --> 16:41.565
Doesn't have to be.

16:46.005 --> 16:47.565
What's become of us?

16:51.005 --> 16:53.125
What has become of us?

16:53.205 --> 16:55.861
- Keep an eye on that kitchen window, you.
- I want no part of this.

16:55.885 --> 16:57.725
Well, you're in too deep now, Clare.

16:57.805 --> 16:59.325
You're stealing a body!

16:59.405 --> 17:02.005
Let's just get it over with,
and never, ever speak of it again.

17:02.085 --> 17:05.525
- Jesus, my nails are fucking ruined.
- Less talking, more digging.

17:05.605 --> 17:07.484
I've got something.

17:10.964 --> 17:11.964
Give it here.

17:13.765 --> 17:16.045
Right. Me and Michelle
go stash him somewhere,

17:16.125 --> 17:18.444
and the rest of you all fill it back in.

17:18.525 --> 17:20.085
- Open the box, Erin.
- Oh, God!

17:20.165 --> 17:22.005
Yes, he is with us.
Do not be afraid, child.

17:29.685 --> 17:31.845
Listen, I can...

17:34.005 --> 17:35.605
Oh, no, actually, I can't.

17:37.045 --> 17:38.485
I can't explain.

17:39.845 --> 17:42.165
Thanks be to God.

17:43.285 --> 17:44.805
Thanks be to God.

17:51.125 --> 17:52.685
I don't understand it.

17:53.365 --> 17:55.285
The Lord's work is often
difficult to comprehend.

17:55.365 --> 17:57.845
No, I mean I really,
really don't understand it.

17:57.925 --> 17:59.325
You're right, Father.

18:00.405 --> 18:01.805
He has... risen.

18:04.685 --> 18:06.845
It's truly a miracle.

18:06.925 --> 18:10.645
- So, what happens now, Peter?
- Well, I think the next stage is Rome.

18:12.045 --> 18:14.485
- Audience with the big man.
- Pavarotti?

18:14.565 --> 18:15.925
John Paul II.

18:17.325 --> 18:19.885
But first let us pray.
Please, join hands.

18:20.645 --> 18:21.805
I don't want you to touch me.

18:24.245 --> 18:25.565
Excuse me.

18:27.005 --> 18:29.845
It is vital you keep
a low profile for a bit.

18:29.925 --> 18:32.005
Do you hear me, Malarkey?

18:34.365 --> 18:35.805
That was nobody.

18:36.605 --> 18:38.725
Well, you could at least
wait till I've asked.

18:38.805 --> 18:41.445
How can I have peace, Erin?
Get back inside.

18:42.325 --> 18:45.205
Why are you calling Maureen Malarkey?

18:45.285 --> 18:47.445
Granda says we're not allowed
to speak to her.

18:47.525 --> 18:49.565
Oh, that? That's all blown over now.

18:51.685 --> 18:53.165
Maureen Malarkey!

18:53.245 --> 18:56.085
Don't you mention that lowdown,
deceitful, cheating old witch!

18:58.525 --> 19:01.565
- Why were you ringing her, Mammy?
- It's none of your business.

19:01.645 --> 19:04.085
Fine. I'll ask her myself.

19:04.805 --> 19:06.005
Stop it, Erin.

19:06.085 --> 19:07.805
Redial.

19:07.885 --> 19:10.685
It was only her answer machine anyway.

19:10.765 --> 19:13.021
- <i>Hello, sorry to miss your call.</i>
- See? Now hang up.

19:13.045 --> 19:15.685
<i>- Like to leave a message for Maureen...</i>
- Hang up, Erin.

19:15.765 --> 19:17.381
<i>...Toto, we'll get back to you</i>

19:17.405 --> 19:19.805
<i>as soon as we can.</i>

19:21.325 --> 19:25.085
You gave Toto to Maureen Malarkey?

19:25.165 --> 19:27.245
Wee Tigger had just passed.

19:27.325 --> 19:28.565
She was lonely.

19:29.765 --> 19:32.285
The chapel. She was there.

19:32.365 --> 19:34.165
That dog was Toto.

19:34.245 --> 19:36.885
Oh, it's all adding up now,
isn't it, Mammy?

19:36.965 --> 19:39.925
- It's all for the best, Erin.
- You staged his death, Ma.

19:40.005 --> 19:42.085
I thought I'd lost him.
- Well, you have lost him.

19:42.165 --> 19:43.765
- We're not taking him back.
- What?

19:43.845 --> 19:45.245
Ah, come on. He's a shit dog.

19:45.325 --> 19:47.325
Toto was not a shit dog.

19:47.405 --> 19:50.405
- Well, he was no Gypsy.
- Stop it. I'm sick of it.

19:50.485 --> 19:52.325
You can't compare
every animal you have

19:52.405 --> 19:54.605
to the dog you had
when you were five years old.

19:54.685 --> 19:57.205
I can and I will.

19:59.125 --> 20:01.085
You're not going to tell your granda,
are you?

20:01.485 --> 20:04.565
Well, I'm going to need some time
to think about that.

20:08.165 --> 20:10.205
Lovely. And another one.

20:12.805 --> 20:15.205
Beautiful. And another one.

20:20.485 --> 20:22.005
I'll be one minute.

20:23.965 --> 20:25.485
Right, get one of me now.

20:40.765 --> 20:41.845
Bonbon?

20:47.285 --> 20:48.645
What a day.

20:49.365 --> 20:50.885
God, this is really hard.

20:50.965 --> 20:53.805
- Oh, it's been incredible.
- Were they always this hard?

20:53.885 --> 20:55.765
You know, to tell you the truth, Erin,

20:55.845 --> 20:58.205
I've been having a bit
of a crisis of faith recently.

20:58.285 --> 20:59.445
Is that so?

21:00.165 --> 21:01.685
Seriously, it's like a jawbreaker.

21:01.765 --> 21:04.285
- It's been very challenging.
- Really?

21:05.765 --> 21:07.445
Sorry, I'm going to have to spit this out.

21:07.485 --> 21:10.725
And you know, it became
more challenging...

21:12.485 --> 21:14.925
when I met this amazing girl.

21:16.965 --> 21:18.605
- There was just this...
- Connection?

21:18.685 --> 21:20.205
Exactly.

21:20.565 --> 21:24.285
You know, made me question everything,
doubt everything.

21:24.365 --> 21:28.445
If God hadn't sent me this sign, I might
have left the priesthood to be with her.

21:28.525 --> 21:29.925
What if he didn't?

21:30.325 --> 21:31.525
I'm sorry?

21:31.605 --> 21:34.365
Send you the sign, I mean.
Just for argument's sake.

21:34.445 --> 21:36.005
Well, he did, Erin.

21:36.085 --> 21:38.125
You know, I could never abandon him now.

21:38.205 --> 21:39.805
- It's not true.
- What?

21:39.885 --> 21:42.085
We're lying. We've been lying.

21:42.165 --> 21:44.285
There was no smirking, no weeping.

21:44.365 --> 21:47.565
The dog's not even dead.
He's living with Maureen Malarkey.

21:47.645 --> 21:50.765
None of it's true, Peter.
It's all balls.

21:50.845 --> 21:54.965
But the good news is you're free.
We're free.

21:55.045 --> 21:56.965
We can be together.

22:07.565 --> 22:08.685
Peter.

22:08.765 --> 22:11.725
Peter, Peter, where are you going?
Peter, wait.

22:12.325 --> 22:15.805
I've got the most amazing news.
I've had a calling.

22:15.885 --> 22:18.485
I've decided to follow in your footsteps.

22:18.565 --> 22:21.925
- I've decided to serve God.
- Don't be such a dick, James.

22:22.005 --> 22:24.685
<i>♪ I said goodbye ♪</i>

22:26.725 --> 22:29.221
So he's just going to pack in
the priesthood now, is he? Completely?

22:29.245 --> 22:31.285
You can't exactly go part-time.

22:31.365 --> 22:32.685
All because of us.

22:32.765 --> 22:34.085
Not all because of us, Orla.

22:34.645 --> 22:36.365
I mean, a bit because of us.

22:36.445 --> 22:40.005
But mostly because it turns out
he had a connection

22:40.085 --> 22:42.845
with one of the colorists
in Hair and Flair,

22:42.925 --> 22:45.525
who does our Sarah's forwards, by the way.

22:45.605 --> 22:47.645
And apparently she's a dirty tramp.

22:47.725 --> 22:49.965
So, you know, good luck with that, Peter.

22:50.645 --> 22:52.765
At least your ma was all right
with Dog Piss Gate.

22:52.845 --> 22:55.205
I thought she was
going to go fucking nuts.

22:55.285 --> 22:56.845
Let me put it this way.

22:56.925 --> 23:01.205
I have locked my mother in a cage
designed by her own art.

23:01.285 --> 23:04.925
Oh, she has been well and truly hoist
by her own petard.

23:05.005 --> 23:08.485
Could you put it another way?
I didn't understand a word of that.

23:08.565 --> 23:10.925
- Sort of blackmailing her.
- Oh, happy days.

23:11.005 --> 23:12.805
God, it's all so mortifying.

23:12.885 --> 23:15.445
- It'll all blow over soon.
- Have you seen this?

23:20.805 --> 23:22.845
Jesus Christ.

23:22.925 --> 23:25.765
This is good. "Wicked" means "good"
in England, doesn't it?

23:25.845 --> 23:27.605
But we're not in England, are we,
Michelle?

23:27.685 --> 23:29.845
And my tits look amazing in that top.

23:31.005 --> 23:32.981
Well, sure, that's the main thing.
