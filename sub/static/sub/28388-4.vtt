00:05.394 --> 00:07.796
Twilight! Look at the
scroll I just got!

00:09.986 --> 00:11.179
Do you know what
this means?

00:11.267 --> 00:12.433
Uh huh!

00:12.535 --> 00:16.952
Uh, I don't. What's so
exciting about a toy crown?

00:17.040 --> 00:20.140
Oh, this is no toy crown.

00:20.242 --> 00:23.009
It's the hard-won helm
of the Sibling Supreme!

00:23.173 --> 00:24.673
When Shining Armor
and I were small,

00:24.761 --> 00:26.928
we competed over
everything.

00:28.000 --> 00:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:40.329 --> 00:42.699
To keep it friendly, our
parents gave us gold stars

00:42.787 --> 00:44.822
every time we did
something special.

00:47.330 --> 00:48.611
Sharing...

00:50.712 --> 00:52.290
Getting good grades...

00:53.775 --> 00:56.119
Even telling a
really funny joke!

00:56.445 --> 00:59.148
And at the end of each week,
we'd add up the stars.

01:01.183 --> 01:02.631
The sibling with the
most would win the crown

01:02.718 --> 01:04.318
of the Sibling Supreme

01:04.420 --> 01:06.767
and bragging rights
till next time!

01:08.123 --> 01:10.540
Guess that explains
your love of charts.

01:10.628 --> 01:12.426
And so much else.

01:12.628 --> 01:15.759
I always wanted to be
Sibling Supreme one day.

01:15.884 --> 01:17.882
Meet me at Celestia's Castle

01:17.970 --> 01:21.658
to decide who deserves the
crown once and for all.

01:21.869 --> 01:23.212
Race ya there.

01:25.341 --> 01:27.705
Guess I'll...
watch the school?

02:13.622 --> 02:15.222
You're wearing it?

02:15.390 --> 02:17.181
Look, I know you've
always held a grudge

02:17.269 --> 02:19.447
because I left
home with this.

02:19.572 --> 02:21.303
Grudge? Pff. What grudge?

02:21.397 --> 02:23.179
Just because you've
had it for way longer

02:23.267 --> 02:24.571
than you should have,
and I never got

02:24.658 --> 02:26.029
a chance
to win it back...

02:26.735 --> 02:29.445
With the return of Sombra,
Princess Luna and I

02:29.533 --> 02:32.406
felt it was time to reinforce
the castle's defenses.

02:32.508 --> 02:34.842
I said we could
do it ourselves,

02:34.944 --> 02:38.298
but some ponies
are a bit stubborn.

02:38.781 --> 02:42.883
So I asked our old Captain of
the Guard to handle the job.

02:43.056 --> 02:46.587
I've taken the security
here to a new level.

02:46.689 --> 02:49.353
The only thing I need now
is somepony to test it.

02:49.525 --> 02:52.525
You want me to break
into Celestia's castle?

02:52.695 --> 02:56.127
If you can get past my
defenses, steal the crown,

02:56.215 --> 02:59.461
and get out, you'll be
Sibling Supreme.

02:59.618 --> 03:00.877
Forever.

03:01.369 --> 03:04.173
Forever!

03:04.406 --> 03:07.749
BUT, if you fail,
I keep the crown.

03:07.837 --> 03:10.640
DEAL! Wait! Are you
sure this counts?

03:10.728 --> 03:12.779
Mom and Dad aren't
giving us any stars.

03:12.881 --> 03:14.781
I will represent
their authority.

03:14.891 --> 03:17.192
And thank you, Twilight.
Your help will reveal

03:17.286 --> 03:19.408
if there are any
holes in our security.

03:20.143 --> 03:21.391
And there aren't.

03:21.479 --> 03:23.960
I've designed a
multi-tiered, impenetrable,

03:24.048 --> 03:26.361
triple-backed-up
line of defense.

03:27.145 --> 03:29.499
<i>The castle is
surrounded by shards</i>

03:29.587 --> 03:31.445
<i>of Queen Chrysalis' throne.</i>

03:31.533 --> 03:34.515
<i>Thanks to Starswirl, its
anti-magic powers are now</i>

03:34.603 --> 03:38.519
<i>tuned to stop anycreature from
using a spell to get inside.</i>

03:38.607 --> 03:40.798
<i>You can't fly in either.</i>

03:41.910 --> 03:44.376
<i>Giant fans keep any
creature from flying</i>

03:44.464 --> 03:45.853
<i>too close to the castle.</i>

03:49.382 --> 03:51.858
<i>Plus the entrances to the
tunnels below the castle</i>

03:51.946 --> 03:55.517
<i>have been sealed. So there's
no underground access.</i>

03:56.142 --> 03:58.258
<i>And even if you could
get in, which you can't,</i>

03:58.360 --> 04:00.049
<i>I've doubled the
ranks of security.</i>

04:00.150 --> 04:02.752
<i>Ponies protect every
hallway and door,</i>

04:03.032 --> 04:06.195
<i>which can only be opened
with Royal Guard medals.</i>

04:08.484 --> 04:10.184
Even if you brought an army...

04:10.272 --> 04:14.308
the throne room is the
safest spot in Equestria.

04:14.517 --> 04:16.492
I rigged a floor
trap to activate

04:16.579 --> 04:18.226
at the slightest touch.

04:20.714 --> 04:22.929
But say you avoid the floor.

04:23.017 --> 04:24.284
Still no luck.

04:24.372 --> 04:27.291
Because I've employed
Nature's alarm system.

04:32.328 --> 04:33.493
Geese?

04:33.588 --> 04:36.625
You can hear their honks
all the way in Ponyville.

04:38.567 --> 04:39.600
Plus they bite.

04:46.508 --> 04:48.650
So that's what we're up against.

04:48.975 --> 04:51.543
That's a barrel and
a half of obstacles,

04:51.647 --> 04:54.150
plus a bushel and peck
of impenetrability.

04:54.238 --> 04:57.931
And all this is to win
some fillyhood competition

04:58.019 --> 04:59.592
with your brother?

04:59.755 --> 05:02.990
It's more than that!
OK, it's exactly that.

05:03.092 --> 05:05.525
And to protect
Celestia's castle.

05:05.627 --> 05:08.703
If it means that much to
you, Twilight, we're in.

05:08.791 --> 05:09.877
I was already in.

05:09.965 --> 05:12.332
C'mon, who doesn't want
to hang with geese?

05:12.434 --> 05:15.035
Of course we'll
help. But how?

05:15.283 --> 05:17.771
Shining Armor may have come
up with some great security,

05:17.873 --> 05:20.274
but he'll never guess
Twilight's plan.

05:20.376 --> 05:21.773
We play to our strengths

05:21.861 --> 05:23.986
and defeat all of the
security measures.

05:24.088 --> 05:26.156
That way, if one of
us fails, the others

05:26.244 --> 05:28.315
will still have a shot
at getting the crown.

05:28.417 --> 05:31.611
Pinkie, you'll distract the
guards with a surprise party.

05:31.728 --> 05:33.654
Yes sir, Twilight sir!

05:33.756 --> 05:36.736
Applejack, you'll buck your
way into the sealed tunnels.

05:36.925 --> 05:40.351
Rainbow Dash, if anypony can
outfly those wind turbines,

05:40.439 --> 05:41.628
it's you.

05:41.730 --> 05:43.843
Rarity, you'll sew
us guard costumes

05:43.931 --> 05:45.565
so we can sneak past security.

05:45.667 --> 05:47.742
Then Fluttershy will disable
the throne room alarm

05:47.830 --> 05:49.145
by charming the geese.

05:52.431 --> 05:54.142
It's from Shining Armor.

05:54.230 --> 05:58.198
Dear Twily, Hope your
idea isn't just...

05:58.286 --> 06:00.961
Tunnels! He guessed
your whole plan!

06:01.049 --> 06:02.117
What?

06:02.205 --> 06:04.156
Pinkie party, Rarity costumes...

06:04.244 --> 06:08.119
Signed, the future Sibling
Supreme? Oh, come on!

06:08.656 --> 06:10.324
Twilight, darling.

06:10.426 --> 06:13.660
Nopony knows you better
than your own brother.

06:13.762 --> 06:15.662
So you're saying
I should give up?

06:15.764 --> 06:18.398
I'm saying your
brother will win.

06:18.500 --> 06:20.234
No matter how
brilliant your plan is,

06:20.322 --> 06:22.636
no matter how many
variations you try,

06:22.738 --> 06:24.504
it will be something
your brother expects

06:24.606 --> 06:28.775
and he'll always win. Unless...

06:28.932 --> 06:30.814
When the perfect
chance comes along,

06:30.902 --> 06:34.988
you do something he can't
expect. Then, you'll win.

06:35.175 --> 06:37.684
You've been practicing
that speech, haven't you?

06:37.786 --> 06:40.243
A little bit. It felt like
I rushed. Did I rush it?

06:40.331 --> 06:41.556
Absolutely not.

06:41.644 --> 06:43.165
Oh! No!

06:43.253 --> 06:45.025
Yeah, it was fastish.

06:45.127 --> 06:48.282
We have to do the opposite of
what Shining Armor expects.

06:48.370 --> 06:51.732
Therefore, Twilight cannot
mastermind the plan...

06:52.052 --> 06:53.785
but I can!

06:54.636 --> 06:57.581
That's... definitely
unexpected.

07:02.625 --> 07:05.087
How is you making
a break-in plan

07:05.175 --> 07:07.488
the opposite of
Twilight doing it?

07:07.749 --> 07:11.385
Because my plan is for
each of us to devise

07:11.487 --> 07:13.553
our own unexpected
part of it!

07:13.655 --> 07:15.636
Allow me to demonstrate.

07:23.832 --> 07:26.032
We're looking for a
pony with information.

07:28.137 --> 07:30.595
We got questions, and
you're gonna serve us up

07:30.683 --> 07:32.284
some answers,
juice jockey.

07:32.372 --> 07:33.854
Where is the secret
entrance to the passages

07:33.941 --> 07:35.723
under Canterlot Castle?

07:35.811 --> 07:38.379
Shining Armor sealed them all.
There is no secret entrance.

07:38.551 --> 07:40.831
There's always a
secret entrance!

07:40.949 --> 07:43.605
So make like a glass
of OJ and spill.

07:43.693 --> 07:45.994
Ooh! Ooh! I know what I can do!

07:46.255 --> 07:50.058
You're gonna need a lookout, so
I can be your eye in the sky!

07:50.292 --> 07:52.592
Too low, silly, up here!

08:02.159 --> 08:03.870
Oh, Pinkie! That tickles!

08:08.273 --> 08:09.773
What?

08:09.861 --> 08:13.566
How about somethin' a little
more down to earth. Like...

08:13.654 --> 08:16.564
I distract the guard ponies
with a farewell performance

08:16.652 --> 08:18.985
by my alter ego, famous
country western super-star,

08:19.087 --> 08:20.784
Apple Chord!

08:21.789 --> 08:23.557
I didn't know you
had an alter-ego.

08:23.659 --> 08:26.329
And why would she be giving
a farewell performance?

08:26.417 --> 08:29.363
Well, it's a long story.

08:31.733 --> 08:32.899
Back on the farm,

08:33.001 --> 08:35.674
playin' music was about
makin' her family smile.

08:38.974 --> 08:40.841
Word of her talent spread,

08:40.943 --> 08:44.544
and soon Apple Chord
was playin' real shows.

08:46.435 --> 08:49.909
The more she played, the
bigger those shows got.

08:55.190 --> 08:57.363
But she missed playin'
for her family.

08:59.270 --> 09:01.931
So one day, she gave it all up.

09:08.203 --> 09:11.158
Seeing her family smile
was all she ever wanted

09:11.246 --> 09:12.379
from her music.

09:12.467 --> 09:15.696
Of course, Apple Chord could
come out of retirement

09:15.784 --> 09:19.152
for a farewell
concert this one time.

09:19.435 --> 09:22.048
Wait. Did you just
make all that up

09:22.136 --> 09:24.017
or did that actually happen?

09:24.290 --> 09:25.423
Um...

09:25.511 --> 09:28.485
It doesn't matter. It's
perfect! Fluttershy? Spike?

09:28.584 --> 09:30.804
I guess the opposite
of what I'm good at

09:30.892 --> 09:33.668
is being in small spaces.

09:33.762 --> 09:36.206
I always wanted
to be a super spy.

09:36.294 --> 09:38.274
Is that the opposite
of anything?

09:40.935 --> 09:44.517
Special Agent Fluttershy,
target detected below.

09:45.974 --> 09:48.202
It's almost too easy.

10:08.470 --> 10:11.031
I guess I'm the only one left
that still needs a plan.

10:11.133 --> 10:16.595
Oh, no, darling, that IS the
plan. You shall do nothing!

10:17.859 --> 10:20.907
Shining Armor definitely
won't expect that.

10:36.970 --> 10:41.061
Applejack? What are you doing?

10:41.163 --> 10:47.000
Applejack? Heh, heh, who's
that? My name's Apple Chord

10:47.102 --> 10:49.369
and I've got a couple
of songs to play for ya.

10:49.571 --> 10:53.358
Clap your hooves if you know
'em. And a one and a two and a..

10:53.446 --> 10:56.029
<i>♪ My love is like a barrel ♪</i>

10:56.117 --> 10:58.124
<i>♪ A barrel full of hay. ♪</i>

11:02.337 --> 11:03.950
The Wonderbolts did a flyby,

11:04.052 --> 11:05.986
and the only way
past those giant fans

11:06.088 --> 11:08.388
and into the castle
ducts is here.

11:08.490 --> 11:10.548
But there's no
room for mistakes!

11:10.657 --> 11:12.359
Just like
space travel!

11:13.801 --> 11:18.321
Uh, Pinkie, we're not actually
going INTO space, right?

11:18.415 --> 11:21.110
No, silly! I'm
dropping you two off

11:21.228 --> 11:22.312
as soon as we're
close to the fans.

11:22.399 --> 11:25.063
Then I'm going
into space.

11:30.445 --> 11:32.912
You're up to
something, Twily.

11:33.014 --> 11:35.499
Nope. Just looking
at the flowers.

11:35.587 --> 11:37.524
Ahhh.

11:37.753 --> 11:39.704
Right.

11:44.760 --> 11:47.610
Ooh! Maybe Rarity's
plan will work!

11:47.704 --> 11:50.913
Canterlot, we have a problem!

11:53.769 --> 11:55.671
I know that one's
a crowd favorite.

11:55.759 --> 11:57.610
What's say we play
it one more time?

11:57.739 --> 11:59.139
And a one, and a two and a --

12:05.106 --> 12:06.759
A distraction's a distraction.

12:14.556 --> 12:15.955
Where's Spike
and Fluttershy?

12:16.057 --> 12:17.724
Did they make it
into the castle?

12:17.826 --> 12:22.454
They jumped out right before
the balloon went TBBBTHHHH.

12:22.579 --> 12:24.931
But that's all I could see
without being in space.

12:25.033 --> 12:27.399
Where I didn't get to go.

12:28.169 --> 12:31.134
Let's hope Rarity and Rainbow
Dash had better luck.

12:34.008 --> 12:36.634
What's this? Closed?

12:36.897 --> 12:38.598
The Seedy Juice Joint
is always closed

12:38.694 --> 12:39.773
around this time.

12:39.861 --> 12:42.255
Then how can we shake
down Ne'er Do Wells

12:42.343 --> 12:43.817
for information?

12:43.919 --> 12:45.785
What sort of
information do you need?

12:45.887 --> 12:47.921
Um, the location to
a secret entrance

12:48.023 --> 12:50.304
to the passages under
Canterlot Castle?

12:50.471 --> 12:51.788
You mean that one?

12:53.194 --> 12:55.523
Yes. Thank you.
That will do nicely.

13:01.435 --> 13:04.046
Zephyr Breeze?

13:04.539 --> 13:09.909
Oh, ho ho ho, darling; this
couldn't be more perfect.

13:10.011 --> 13:11.411
How is this perfect?

13:11.527 --> 13:13.827
He's the most annoying
pony in Equestria,

13:13.915 --> 13:15.482
and he's totally
obsessed with me,

13:15.584 --> 13:18.518
and we have to come up
with a way to distract.

13:18.850 --> 13:22.302
Oh, no! No way! Uh, uh!

13:27.499 --> 13:30.419
Rainbow! I knew
you'd come running

13:30.507 --> 13:31.831
when you heard I
got this job.

13:31.933 --> 13:34.535
The mares love a pony
in uniform, am I right?

13:34.623 --> 13:36.194
Not really.

13:40.474 --> 13:43.209
I mean, totally.

13:43.311 --> 13:45.544
Why don't you step
into the light

13:45.632 --> 13:50.491
so I can see how
handsome you look in it?

14:01.159 --> 14:04.575
I told the Sarge that gold
kinda clashes with my aura,

14:04.663 --> 14:06.765
but apparently, they
aren't big on "input".

14:06.937 --> 14:09.235
Still, I totally manage
to rock the look,

14:09.337 --> 14:10.497
don't you think?

14:10.585 --> 14:14.374
Yep. You're real
guard material.

14:14.476 --> 14:17.319
I'm part of the castle team
now, so I'm basically...

14:17.437 --> 14:19.530
Whoa, we got a swooner!

14:20.548 --> 14:22.081
It's good you're
finally being honest

14:22.183 --> 14:23.817
with your feelings
for me, Rainbows.

14:24.013 --> 14:25.279
Yech!

14:25.523 --> 14:27.106
The truth is such a gift.

14:27.194 --> 14:30.312
Like, I had to follow my bliss
to see guarding is my calling.

14:30.437 --> 14:32.828
Like look at me go. I'm going
to walk over here and I go woo!

14:32.915 --> 14:34.114
Over there! And I go yeah!

14:34.202 --> 14:36.123
And sometimes I just stand
like this and look real cool

14:36.210 --> 14:39.538
and I go down the
hallway going...

14:49.310 --> 14:52.734
We'll have to glide to
the throne. No flapping.

15:06.398 --> 15:09.560
Sister! Another false alarm

15:09.648 --> 15:11.505
from Shining
Armor's guard geese!

15:14.536 --> 15:15.935
We should have heard by now.

15:16.037 --> 15:17.501
Something must have gone wrong.

15:17.589 --> 15:19.484
Probably
several somethings.

15:22.209 --> 15:24.200
No lookout, no distraction,

15:24.288 --> 15:26.145
and no word from
the ponies inside.

15:26.247 --> 15:28.114
I'm starting to think
this whole operation

15:28.216 --> 15:30.077
might be a giant flop.

15:38.093 --> 15:39.624
Oh, no!

15:39.985 --> 15:41.130
Gee, Fluttershy,

15:41.218 --> 15:43.029
I thought your whole
"small spaces" thing

15:43.131 --> 15:44.964
was just part of the
plan to be unexpected.

15:45.105 --> 15:47.614
Once I got trapped in the
Castle of the Two Sisters,

15:47.702 --> 15:49.669
and Angel Bunny and
I were separated.

15:49.771 --> 15:52.859
Now whenever I'm in a tiny room,
it's all I can think about!

15:52.947 --> 15:56.482
I was so worried he felt
alone and forgotten.

15:56.711 --> 15:58.411
I know what
that's like.

15:58.609 --> 16:00.413
What do you mean?

16:00.515 --> 16:03.016
I was always excited to
be a part of Twilight's

16:03.118 --> 16:06.140
and Shining Armor's rivalry,
like I was their little brother,

16:06.420 --> 16:08.562
but they never really
thought of me that way.

16:08.790 --> 16:12.429
I know they both have a special
place in their heart for you,

16:12.569 --> 16:15.567
but sibling dynamics
are hard. Trust me.

16:15.655 --> 16:17.692
Ugh. Right. Zephyr Breeze.

16:17.780 --> 16:20.302
Honestly, he could
learn a lot from you

16:20.390 --> 16:21.510
about being a
little brother.

16:23.338 --> 16:26.489
I'm sick of being lost
in these slimy corridors too,

16:26.577 --> 16:28.927
but you shouldn't pull every
lever you come across.

16:29.015 --> 16:30.575
Half of them are traps.

16:30.663 --> 16:33.146
And the other half might
open a secret passage

16:33.248 --> 16:34.248
to the castle!

16:34.336 --> 16:35.882
It's not
worth the risk!

16:35.970 --> 16:37.226
Oh,
hello, Spike.

16:37.314 --> 16:39.474
Even if we did find our
way into the castle,

16:39.562 --> 16:41.316
we'd still have all
of those guards--

16:41.404 --> 16:43.241
SPIKE! FLUTTERSHY!

16:43.950 --> 16:46.372
What are you guys
doing down here?

16:46.460 --> 16:48.594
We kind of fell
through the floor.

16:48.696 --> 16:50.882
I don't think our
plan is working.

16:50.970 --> 16:52.498
If we've both
hit dead ends,

16:52.600 --> 16:56.135
perhaps we should return to
the outside and revaluate.

16:58.473 --> 16:59.804
Ech!

17:04.353 --> 17:05.353
Psssst!

17:08.715 --> 17:10.316
What are you all doing out here?

17:10.429 --> 17:14.835
In retrospect, our plan might
have been too unexpected.

17:15.405 --> 17:19.694
Every part of it failed? Oh,
now I'll never get the crown.

17:19.978 --> 17:23.069
Maybe we should go back to
doing things the Twilight way.

17:23.282 --> 17:25.444
You mean, the
totally expected way?

17:25.671 --> 17:27.089
It may not be a surprise,

17:27.178 --> 17:29.726
but you have a pretty good
record for planning things.

17:31.988 --> 17:34.812
Then I guess it's worth
a try. Thanks, Spike.

17:34.944 --> 17:36.669
What are little
brothers for?

17:36.757 --> 17:39.677
OK. You all know
what to do!

17:58.666 --> 18:00.521
At least one part of
our unexpected plan

18:00.609 --> 18:01.609
worked unexpectedly.

18:14.032 --> 18:17.241
To be fair, it was never made
specifically clear to me

18:17.329 --> 18:20.834
what "guarding" actually
means. So this is on you.

18:23.966 --> 18:26.833
I'm strong, Twilight,
but not even I

18:26.921 --> 18:28.726
can buck through solid rock.

18:28.930 --> 18:31.319
That's why I brought
a specialist.

18:44.986 --> 18:47.843
Next shift. You're on break.

19:03.192 --> 19:05.890
You've been
glaring so hard!

19:06.077 --> 19:08.577
Who wants a feather massage?

19:10.306 --> 19:12.952
We mapped this out when
we got lost down here.

19:13.155 --> 19:16.563
The lever to the secret
hallway entrance should be...

19:16.651 --> 19:17.929
Here.

19:22.884 --> 19:25.265
I can't believe this worked!

19:25.376 --> 19:28.694
I guess sometimes the best
plan is the one you expect.

19:29.258 --> 19:31.945
All I have to do now is fly
over and take the crown,

19:32.033 --> 19:34.841
and I'll be Sibling
Supreme forever.

19:35.015 --> 19:36.662
<i>Not exactly.</i>

19:38.266 --> 19:40.163
Oh, come on!

19:40.270 --> 19:43.005
Gotta admit, it was
unexpected for you to do

19:43.093 --> 19:46.028
everything exactly how
I thought you would.

19:46.116 --> 19:48.141
But you should know
by now there's no way

19:48.243 --> 19:51.124
to beat the true
SIBLING SUPREME!

19:51.212 --> 19:54.192
I am sorry, Twilight,
but it looks as though.

19:54.280 --> 19:56.968
Shining Armor has
truly won the crown.

19:57.081 --> 19:58.873
That's the thing about looks...

19:58.961 --> 20:01.629
...they can be deceiving!

20:01.723 --> 20:02.903
Spike?

20:02.991 --> 20:05.030
How in Equestria
did you do it?

20:05.118 --> 20:07.646
Come on. You two don't
think you have the only

20:07.734 --> 20:11.008
sibling rivalry. I had
an inside pony help.

20:13.065 --> 20:15.481
It wasn't hard to miss
there was some disagreement

20:15.569 --> 20:17.468
on the whole "security" thing.

20:18.159 --> 20:20.208
I said we could
do it ourselves,

20:20.296 --> 20:23.335
but some ponies are
a bit more stubborn.

20:23.572 --> 20:25.718
<i>So, while Shining
Armor went on and on</i>

20:25.806 --> 20:28.165
<i>about all his improved
security measures,</i>

20:28.253 --> 20:30.120
<i>Luna and I struck a deal.</i>

20:30.208 --> 20:32.209
<i>She put Zephyr in
charge of the catacombs</i>

20:32.338 --> 20:34.827
<i>and helped keep Celestia
out of the castle hallways.</i>

20:34.922 --> 20:38.357
<i>Once Luna was on board, I
just had to do my part...</i>

20:38.892 --> 20:41.060
<i>...and make sure we
stuck to Twilight's plan,</i>

20:41.148 --> 20:43.629
<i>so we'd all get to the throne
room at the same time.</i>

20:43.897 --> 20:46.067
<i>I knew Shining Armor
would let it play out</i>

20:46.155 --> 20:47.567
<i>until the last
possible second.</i>

20:47.701 --> 20:50.369
<i>Then, while everyone was
distracted by his gloating,</i>

20:50.471 --> 20:54.218
<i>all Luna had to do was
float the crown over to me.</i>

20:57.142 --> 20:58.350
Ahem.

20:58.438 --> 21:02.796
I apologize for not listening
to your concerns, sister.

21:02.898 --> 21:04.489
It seems we need
to make adjustments

21:04.577 --> 21:08.153
to account for threats inside
the castle as well as out.

21:08.241 --> 21:09.622
If you agree?

21:09.724 --> 21:12.804
If you think it's
worth discussing.

21:13.171 --> 21:17.460
So... if Twilight and
Shining Armor failed...

21:17.580 --> 21:19.249
who gets the crown?

21:20.936 --> 21:24.741
The true Sibling Supreme. Spike.

21:24.829 --> 21:25.829
Huh?

21:25.917 --> 21:28.065
The little brother
we've always had!
