WEBVTT

00:02.611 --> 00:04.178
Your suitcase
feels light.

00:04.265 --> 00:06.615
Well, I need the space.
It's a nice hotel,

00:06.702 --> 00:10.445
and I plan on taking everything
that's not nailed down.

00:10.532 --> 00:13.404
You can't tell me you're
gonna steal. I'm a cop.

00:13.491 --> 00:14.971
So you don't want me
to swipe you a robe?

00:15.058 --> 00:17.191
Absolutely not.

00:18.540 --> 00:19.715
Or slippers,
if they're the big,

00:19.802 --> 00:22.718
fluffy kind I like.[giggles]

00:22.805 --> 00:24.328
You girls enjoy
yourselves at the casino.

00:24.415 --> 00:27.027
And when you get there,
put this on 29 black.

00:27.114 --> 00:29.942
Odds are 35 to one.

00:30.030 --> 00:31.814
If it hits,
it'll be $700.

00:31.901 --> 00:33.207
With those winnings, put $100

00:33.294 --> 00:34.643
on each of the
following numbers:

00:34.730 --> 00:38.734
eight, 13, 20,
28, 29 and 30. Now,

00:38.821 --> 00:42.085
if one of those hits,
that's $3,500.

00:42.172 --> 00:44.087
Put $2,600 in
your pocket,

00:44.174 --> 00:47.221
then bet $200 on
each of the numbers.

00:47.308 --> 00:49.136
When that hits,
it'll be seven grand.

00:49.223 --> 00:51.138
At that point,
call me for step two.

00:53.792 --> 00:54.489
Did you get
all that?

00:54.576 --> 00:57.013
28, 29, 30.

00:57.100 --> 00:59.668
Yeah, pretty simple.

01:01.670 --> 01:03.454
All right, your bag
is in the trunk.

01:03.541 --> 01:04.847
Call me when
you get to the hotel.

01:04.934 --> 01:06.718
Remember, no open
containers in the car.

01:06.805 --> 01:09.286
Tell your mom I smelled
the wine in her travel mug.

01:09.373 --> 01:10.418
All right?

01:10.505 --> 01:13.595
She's got to down it or dump it.

01:13.682 --> 01:15.292
She filled that up
like five minutes ago.

01:15.379 --> 01:17.164
That thing's bone-dry.[laughs]

01:18.817 --> 01:20.776
I wish you were going.

01:20.863 --> 01:24.736
No, you don't.I really don't.
Is that bad?

01:24.823 --> 01:26.173
No. You're having
a girls' weekend,

01:26.260 --> 01:28.392
I'm having a boys' weekend.Yeah.

01:28.479 --> 01:30.090
You're gonna get spa treatments

01:30.177 --> 01:32.570
and I'm not gonna shower
for two days. Everybody wins.

01:34.529 --> 01:36.748
All right, Joyce,
I love you.

01:36.835 --> 01:38.228
Have fun and be safe.

01:38.315 --> 01:40.970
Take your pick. I can't do both.

01:41.057 --> 01:43.407
Be safe.

01:43.494 --> 01:44.713
And don't forget.

01:44.800 --> 01:47.368
Eight, 13, 20,

01:47.455 --> 01:49.587
28, 29 and 30.

01:49.674 --> 01:52.155
Unless the dealer
has an anchor tattoo.

01:52.242 --> 01:55.115
Then tell Roy "hi" and
put everything on black.

This is great.

02:28.191 --> 02:30.454
I haven't had a bed to myself

02:30.541 --> 02:34.502
since that magical weekend
when I had the flu.

02:34.589 --> 02:37.026
Sleeping with Vince
is no picnic, either.

02:37.113 --> 02:38.027
Night sweats, salami breath.

02:38.114 --> 02:40.247
And in the morning,

02:40.334 --> 02:43.163
it ain't Mr. Bluebird
pecking on my shoulder.

02:43.250 --> 02:44.990
Well, we only
got two beds,

02:45.077 --> 02:47.123
so someone is sleeping
with somebody.

02:47.210 --> 02:49.343
All right, pick a number
between one and ten.

02:49.430 --> 02:50.344
Five.

02:50.431 --> 02:52.737
Oh. No.

02:52.824 --> 02:54.086
Guys, we did not
come here to sleep.

02:54.174 --> 02:57.394
We are in Indiana.
[whoops]

02:57.481 --> 03:00.615
By the time we leave, they're
gonna call it Sindiana.

03:00.702 --> 03:02.182
[whoops]

03:02.269 --> 03:03.922
Come on, Mol, let's
go down to the casino.

03:04.009 --> 03:06.534
Nope. The only thing I'm
gambling on is whether or not

03:06.621 --> 03:09.537
my masseuse notices
that my coupon's expired.

03:09.624 --> 03:11.191
All right, then,
enjoy your massage.

03:11.278 --> 03:13.236
And remember, if
their hand slips,

03:13.323 --> 03:15.630
it's not cheating.

03:15.717 --> 03:17.109
[whoops]

03:19.634 --> 03:21.897
ANNOUNCER:
Running one-hander,
banks it in.

03:21.984 --> 03:23.333
This is living, huh?

03:23.420 --> 03:25.030
Eat what you want,
watch what you want,

03:25.117 --> 03:27.685
no ladies telling you to put
your drink on a coaster.

03:27.772 --> 03:29.861
You told me to put
mydrink on a coaster.

03:29.948 --> 03:32.299
'Cause your glass
sweats more than you do.

03:32.386 --> 03:36.085
All right, we
got pork chops,

03:36.172 --> 03:38.174
hamburgers,
ribs and sausage.

03:38.261 --> 03:40.872
Everything is on
a bone or a bun.

03:40.959 --> 03:42.178
No utensils needed.

03:42.265 --> 03:43.701
And if you got a shirt,

03:43.788 --> 03:45.877
you got a napkin.

03:45.964 --> 03:48.924
Let the games begin.

03:49.011 --> 03:50.969
Uh, da, da,
da, da, da.

03:52.797 --> 03:54.756
You forgetting something?

03:54.843 --> 03:56.279
Oh, the mustard.
Yeah, I don't do that anymore.

03:56.366 --> 04:00.152
I-I think my palate's evolving.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.850
Uh, da, da.

04:01.937 --> 04:03.939
We got the department
fitness test coming up.

04:04.026 --> 04:05.767
That's next week.

04:05.854 --> 04:08.509
This is today.

04:08.596 --> 04:10.424
Back off.

04:10.511 --> 04:12.469
Uh, ba, ba,
ba, ba, ba.

04:12.556 --> 04:14.428
You think that sausage is gonna
leave your system by next week?

04:14.515 --> 04:17.431
Are you kidding? I haven't eaten
anything this greasy in months.

04:17.518 --> 04:19.824
This will be out of my
system in an hour.Uh-uh.

04:19.911 --> 04:20.390
Uh, da, da.

04:23.915 --> 04:26.396
Have you done anything
to prepare for this?Yeah.

04:26.483 --> 04:30.182
I marinated these
sausages all night.

04:34.012 --> 04:36.188
Man, I'm talking
about the fitness test.

04:36.276 --> 04:37.799
You're chewing
your way to failure.Aw.

04:37.886 --> 04:39.322
What's he got to do,
touch his toes?

04:39.409 --> 04:41.585
'Cause I think
that ship has sailed.

04:43.892 --> 04:46.068
No, he-he's got to run
a mile in 13 minutes,

04:46.155 --> 04:48.113
he's got to bench 60%
of his body weight...Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

04:48.200 --> 04:49.724
stop right there.

04:49.811 --> 04:54.859
I don't think Lou Ferrigno
could bench 60% of that.

04:58.254 --> 05:00.212
40 bucks says
Mike can't do it.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.432
I'll take some of that action.

05:02.519 --> 05:04.695
I've seen him pick up
and shake a vending machine

05:04.782 --> 05:07.263
to dislodge
a stuck bag of chips.

05:07.350 --> 05:09.047
Yeah, but that's adrenaline.

05:09.134 --> 05:11.528
Like a mom lifting
a car off her baby.

05:11.615 --> 05:14.226
I'll take a lick
of that lollipop.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.881
You'll take a lick
off anything.

05:16.968 --> 05:18.492
Shut him up.

05:18.579 --> 05:19.971
I will shut
you all up.

05:20.058 --> 05:22.017
I got a weight bench
in the basement.

05:22.104 --> 05:24.106
Here, hold my plate.

05:28.502 --> 05:31.548
Smart move.

05:33.985 --> 05:35.247
[slot machines dinging]

05:35.335 --> 05:37.293
Seven out.Aw.

05:37.380 --> 05:38.990
Damn it.

05:39.077 --> 05:41.253
Should have given the dice
a little lucky blow.

05:41.341 --> 05:45.910
Should've given one
to the dealer.

05:45.997 --> 05:47.999
Hey.Hey.

05:48.086 --> 05:49.392
How was
your massage?

05:49.479 --> 05:53.178
Great. I got the
shiatsu'd out of me.

05:53.265 --> 05:55.920
Well, we're getting worked over
pretty good here, too.

05:56.007 --> 05:57.139
New shooter.

05:57.226 --> 05:58.488
[gasps]

05:58.575 --> 05:59.794
We got one, right here.What, me?

05:59.881 --> 06:02.057
No, I've never
played before.

06:02.144 --> 06:03.450
I know.

06:03.537 --> 06:06.148
Hey. I got a virgin
shooter here.

06:06.235 --> 06:07.889
[whoops]Yes.

06:07.976 --> 06:10.674
I give you my firstborn.

06:10.761 --> 06:14.374
And you, give me
a $5 "yo" coming out.

06:14.461 --> 06:16.288
Anyway, I should be
pretty good at this.

06:16.376 --> 06:17.289
Like Yahtzee with
less dice, huh?

06:17.377 --> 06:20.075
Yo, 11,

06:20.162 --> 06:21.642
winner.[whooping, cheering]

06:21.729 --> 06:22.947
Thank you.What just happened?

06:23.034 --> 06:24.775
[chuckles] You won.Oh.

06:24.862 --> 06:26.516
Wow, that wasfun.

06:26.603 --> 06:28.692
Thanks, you guys. I'm
gonna meet you back up...

06:28.779 --> 06:30.651
Mol, no, no,
it's not over yet.

06:30.738 --> 06:31.913
You got to keep rolling.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.088
Well, when do I stop?[chuckles]

06:33.175 --> 06:34.306
When Mama's driving home

06:34.394 --> 06:36.265
in her new Escalade.

06:36.352 --> 06:37.919
Now roll.

06:38.006 --> 06:41.270
Roll until we're in
a different tax bracket.

06:41.357 --> 06:45.405
Winner.[cheering, whooping]

06:45.492 --> 06:47.189
Give... me...

06:47.276 --> 06:50.279
my... sausage.

06:50.366 --> 06:52.586
Can't lift
a toilet seat,

06:52.673 --> 06:54.239
but when there's
smoked meat involved,

06:54.326 --> 06:55.415
he turns into
the Incredible Bulk.

06:58.156 --> 06:59.680
You satisfied?

06:59.767 --> 07:01.551
It's not your strength
I'm worried about.

07:01.638 --> 07:04.641
You're built like a gorilla.
Same haircut and everything.

07:04.728 --> 07:06.556
It's the mile run
that scares me.Drop it, Carl.

07:06.643 --> 07:08.428
I just benched 210,
which is more than enough

07:08.515 --> 07:10.778
to throw you
out of the house.

07:10.865 --> 07:12.301
Yeah, why don't you
run me around the house

07:12.388 --> 07:13.650
and round the block
a couple of times.

07:13.737 --> 07:15.783
Ha, ha, very funny.

07:15.870 --> 07:18.394
No, seriously. I'll give you
an eight-hour head start.[scoffs]

07:18.481 --> 07:20.527
I can't believe
that lump benched 210.

07:20.614 --> 07:22.529
You know, it's a proven
fact overweight people

07:22.616 --> 07:25.140
are surprisingly strong.

07:25.227 --> 07:27.142
Every time I tie my
shoes, it's a 200-pound

07:27.229 --> 07:28.535
dead lift to sit back up.

07:31.320 --> 07:32.539
I'm just saying.

07:34.671 --> 07:37.805
I bet you can't even
lift 100 pounds.

07:37.892 --> 07:40.634
Feats of strength,
or lack thereof, bore me.

07:40.721 --> 07:43.071
Entice me with something
more challenging.

07:43.158 --> 07:46.466
A duel of endurance,
a test of my mental fortitude.

07:47.902 --> 07:49.381
Double or nothing,

07:49.469 --> 07:52.123
he can fit 50 marshmallows
in his mouth.

07:55.387 --> 07:56.214
50?

07:56.301 --> 07:57.477
That's the number.

08:01.524 --> 08:04.919
He barely has room
for his tongue.

08:05.006 --> 08:06.660
It's a bet.[laughs]

08:06.747 --> 08:10.054
You've already lost
and you don't even know it.

08:12.187 --> 08:14.406
[whooping, cheering]

08:14.494 --> 08:15.799
All right.Yeah, yeah.

08:15.886 --> 08:17.627
Let's press the six,
eight, nine.

08:17.714 --> 08:20.151
Hard ways for the dealer.
Let's buy that Bo Derek for $50.

08:20.238 --> 08:21.805
[whoops]

08:21.892 --> 08:24.547
Come on, Molly, you can do it.
Hit that hard eight.

08:24.634 --> 08:25.940
MOLLY:
Yes!

08:26.027 --> 08:27.245
[cheering, whooping]

08:27.332 --> 08:28.420
The hard way.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.031
I love you.[laughing]

08:30.118 --> 08:32.816
I don't say it often enough,
but I love you.

08:32.903 --> 08:36.080
Maybe we should cash out
while we're ahead.Yeah,

08:36.167 --> 08:39.214
I may not have an Escalade,
but I can lease a Hyundai.

08:39.301 --> 08:40.476
I can't leave them.
They need me, right?

08:40.563 --> 08:43.218
Shooter! Shooter!

08:43.305 --> 08:45.525
Shooter! Shooter!That's me. I'm Shooter.

08:45.612 --> 08:48.528
All right.
Who wants a hard ten?

08:48.615 --> 08:49.920
CROWD:
Hard ten! Hard ten!

08:50.007 --> 08:52.183
Hard ten it is![cheering, whooping]

08:52.270 --> 08:55.230
Can you dig it?

08:59.277 --> 08:59.669
SAMUEL:
46.

09:01.497 --> 09:03.934
47.

09:05.632 --> 09:08.199
48.

09:08.286 --> 09:11.115
Choke, damn you, choke.

09:12.160 --> 09:14.162
49.

09:21.561 --> 09:23.519
And 50.

09:26.217 --> 09:29.003
You should see your face.

09:33.181 --> 09:35.531
What? Are you crazy?

09:35.618 --> 09:38.360
Carl, come on. Seriously,
give me back my nachos.

09:38.447 --> 09:40.318
No, this is for your own good.

09:40.405 --> 09:41.581
You know what'll happen if you
don't pass that fitness test.

09:41.668 --> 09:44.496
You get desk
duty. Huh?

09:44.584 --> 09:47.325
Is that why you became a cop?
To protect and file?

09:47.412 --> 09:48.718
Look, I get it.

09:48.805 --> 09:50.502
No, you
don't get it.

09:50.590 --> 09:52.156
If you don't clean up your act,

09:52.243 --> 09:53.549
you're gonna end up
a desk donkey.

09:53.636 --> 09:55.725
Oh, would you shut up
about that?

09:55.812 --> 09:57.945
I'm worried about you.Well, so am I!

09:58.032 --> 10:00.251
Okay? I don't think
that I can pass that thing.

10:00.338 --> 10:02.819
That mile run's been on my mind
for a month and a half.

10:02.906 --> 10:05.126
I'm too slow,
I'm too out of shape,

10:05.213 --> 10:06.736
and I don't need you pointing
out things that I already know!

10:06.823 --> 10:09.696
Mike Biggs is gonna be
a desk donkey.

10:09.783 --> 10:13.569
Haw, haw! There. You happy?

10:13.656 --> 10:15.615
[door slams]

10:19.575 --> 10:20.924
What are you looking at?

10:21.011 --> 10:23.361
Those nachos.

10:33.415 --> 10:35.547
Oh. The buffet
was wonderful.

10:35.635 --> 10:38.550
Mom, you got a crab leg
sticking out of your purse.

10:38.638 --> 10:42.685
Well, it said "all you can eat,"
and I'm not done.

10:42.772 --> 10:43.555
STICKMAN:
Snake eyes.
Craps.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.470
[groans]
Cowards!

10:45.557 --> 10:48.430
Where are you going?
Yeah, don't come crawling back

10:48.517 --> 10:51.912
when old Shooter
catches fire again!

10:51.999 --> 10:54.305
Molly, have you been here
the whole time?[sighs]

10:54.392 --> 10:57.265
No. No, I went back up
to the room to get my purse

10:57.352 --> 11:00.094
and to look through your bags
for money.

11:00.181 --> 11:01.486
STICKMAN:
Craps.[groans]

11:01.573 --> 11:03.532
Why have you forsaken me?!

11:03.619 --> 11:05.752
Okay, Mol, I think we
need to take a break.

11:05.839 --> 11:07.579
No, I can't.
I got to win my money back.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.146
How much did you lose?

11:09.233 --> 11:10.582
All of it.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.236
And more. So much more.

11:12.323 --> 11:14.064
I mean, why would they
let you take money out

11:14.151 --> 11:15.457
on your credit card?
Why would they do that?

11:15.544 --> 11:16.893
Why would they do that?

11:16.980 --> 11:19.156
So they can have
all-you-can-eat crab legs

11:19.243 --> 11:21.071
in the middle
of Indiana.

11:21.158 --> 11:23.117
Ooh, let's hit
that machine.

11:25.423 --> 11:27.512
[door opens]

11:27.599 --> 11:30.124
Hey.

11:30.211 --> 11:32.517
Hey.

11:32.604 --> 11:34.563
Mind if I join you?

11:34.650 --> 11:36.086
You've been sitting next to me
for eight years.

11:36.173 --> 11:38.175
Might as well do it
while we still can.

11:38.262 --> 11:41.091
All right, well,
scoot over. I'm driving.

11:42.876 --> 11:44.616
[exhales, sniffs]

11:44.704 --> 11:46.706
[exhales]

11:49.273 --> 11:50.927
I'm sorry.

11:51.014 --> 11:53.147
I had no idea what
you were going through.

11:53.234 --> 11:56.193
That's because I wasn't dealing
with it myself.

11:56.280 --> 11:57.629
Yeah, but still, I shouldn't
have pushed you so hard.

11:57.717 --> 12:00.328
I just...

12:00.415 --> 12:02.460
I don't want to
lose my partner.

12:02.547 --> 12:04.767
Neither do I.

12:04.854 --> 12:06.943
[sighs]
I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

12:07.030 --> 12:10.338
Well, the way I see it,
we got two options.

12:10.425 --> 12:14.603
I throw the test and
desk-donkey it up with you,

12:14.690 --> 12:16.474
or we get you to
run that mile.

12:16.561 --> 12:20.957
I'm telling you,
man, I can't.

12:21.044 --> 12:21.784
You can.

12:21.871 --> 12:24.526
I'm out of shape.

12:24.613 --> 12:26.702
How is that news? You've
never been in shape.

12:26.789 --> 12:29.574
Thanks a lot.No, I'm serious.

12:29.661 --> 12:31.141
Do you know
how many times

12:31.228 --> 12:33.187
I didn't think you were
gonna pass that test?

12:33.274 --> 12:35.580
Every time.
[chuckles][chuckles]

12:35.667 --> 12:37.626
Well, my streak's ending.

12:37.713 --> 12:39.193
It's finally
caught up with me.

12:39.280 --> 12:42.631
Aw, that's bull. You
squeak by every year.

12:42.718 --> 12:44.807
You're Mike
"Squeaky" Biggs.

12:44.894 --> 12:46.678
You're the man who does
the absolute minimum

12:46.766 --> 12:50.204
at the last minute with the
least amount of effort possible.

12:50.291 --> 12:52.684
You will squeak again.

12:55.209 --> 12:57.646
You really believe that?

12:57.733 --> 13:00.649
You know what I
believe? I believe...

13:00.736 --> 13:02.738
if we run around
this block right now,

13:02.825 --> 13:06.698
you would do a 13-minute mile
in 12 minutes, 59 seconds

13:06.786 --> 13:09.049
'cause that's how you do.

13:11.399 --> 13:12.835
I don't know about "run."

13:12.922 --> 13:16.056
There he is. Already
lowering the bar.

13:16.143 --> 13:18.319
How about a brisk walk?

13:19.581 --> 13:21.626
What the hell?

13:21.713 --> 13:25.674
Let's show these sons of bitches
the least I can do.

13:28.329 --> 13:29.852
MAN:
Yeah, you have to wear
the bathing suit.

13:29.939 --> 13:33.290
It's nice just sitting
in the room watching a movie.

13:33.377 --> 13:36.206
Way better than gambling.
Much better.

13:36.293 --> 13:39.731
I am... I am glad
I'm not down there.

13:39.819 --> 13:42.647
You know what, I think
I'm gonna take a shower.

13:42.734 --> 13:44.736
[quietly]:
You gonna be okay
alone with her?

13:44.824 --> 13:46.651
Please. If I can keep you
in high school,

13:46.738 --> 13:48.740
I can keep her
in a hotel room.

13:50.612 --> 13:52.483
[clicks tongue]
Ooh...

13:52.570 --> 13:53.876
Where are you going?

13:53.963 --> 13:56.836
Nowhere. I'm just
getting some ice.

13:56.923 --> 13:59.621
Oh, you know what?
We're almost out.

13:59.708 --> 14:01.014
I should probably refill this.

14:01.101 --> 14:03.886
We'll send your sister
when she's done.

14:03.973 --> 14:08.456
Oh, nonsense.
I'm already... I'm already up.

14:11.938 --> 14:13.243
Move.

14:13.330 --> 14:14.723
Make me.

14:14.810 --> 14:15.767
Are we doing this?

14:15.855 --> 14:18.379
We're doing this.

14:18.466 --> 14:20.207
Please.

14:20.294 --> 14:21.817
You're not going anywhere!No! No!

14:21.904 --> 14:23.601
You are not going anywhere!Get off me!

14:23.688 --> 14:26.169
Stop! You're not going anywhere!Get off me!

14:26.256 --> 14:28.215
No!

14:28.302 --> 14:30.521
[panting]
Oh!

14:30.608 --> 14:33.960
[muffled]:
No! Victoria, help!

14:34.047 --> 14:35.309
Ha!

14:35.396 --> 14:36.876
What are you gonna do?

14:36.963 --> 14:39.095
You got no money to gamble with.

14:39.182 --> 14:40.618
Yeah? Where's the $20
that Vince gave you?

14:40.705 --> 14:42.185
In my bra.

14:42.272 --> 14:44.840
Is it? Ha!

14:44.927 --> 14:47.103
You felt up your own mother.

14:47.190 --> 14:49.105
How low will you go?

14:49.192 --> 14:52.456
I hope to God
I don't have to find out.

15:02.684 --> 15:04.686
[mutters]

15:05.905 --> 15:08.559
[beeping]Yes.

15:08.646 --> 15:11.823
[coins clinking]That, uh... I w...
I was playing that one.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.782
You should've kept playing it.

15:13.869 --> 15:18.004
Well, how about... how about
we say that we'll split it?

15:18.091 --> 15:19.875
Why don't we say you shove it?

15:22.225 --> 15:23.923
You're a nasty woman.

15:24.010 --> 15:29.015
Enjoy the little time
you have left.Oh...

15:38.459 --> 15:40.417
[coughing]

15:42.985 --> 15:44.900
[whispers]:
Thank you.

15:47.729 --> 15:50.297
Go forth. Go forth and multiply.

15:50.384 --> 15:52.342
[chuckles]

15:54.301 --> 15:56.781
So how long's
this 13-minute mile been?

15:56.868 --> 15:59.654
We're going on 48 minutes.

15:59.741 --> 16:03.092
Think he can shave a half hour
off by Thursday?

16:03.179 --> 16:05.965
I'm hoping
he's back by Thursday.

16:07.009 --> 16:09.098
Little help here!

16:09.185 --> 16:10.752
And 48:15.

16:10.839 --> 16:13.189
What happened?

16:13.276 --> 16:15.583
[grunts]
I think I tore my Achilles.Yeah,

16:15.670 --> 16:17.585
he was showboating,
running laps around me,

16:17.672 --> 16:19.369
tried to jump a parking meter.

16:19.456 --> 16:20.718
Yeah, they're making 'em
taller than they used to.

16:20.805 --> 16:21.893
Or maybe your balls got longer.

16:24.026 --> 16:26.724
Mine drop an eighth
of an inch a year.

16:26.811 --> 16:27.943
Can we just get him
in the house, please?

16:28.030 --> 16:30.380
[grunts]
It was unbelievable.

16:30.467 --> 16:32.600
Mike just picked me up and
carried me for seven blocks.

16:32.687 --> 16:33.862
I wasn't heavy.

16:33.949 --> 16:36.299
I was his brother.

16:36.386 --> 16:38.432
It's all right, Carl.No,

16:38.519 --> 16:40.651
it's not. I'm done.
I'm gonna get put on desk duty.

16:40.738 --> 16:42.088
Hee-haw.Shut up.

16:42.175 --> 16:44.960
But you, you're gonna make it.

16:45.047 --> 16:47.963
'Cause when the chips are down,
Mike Biggs always comes through.

16:48.050 --> 16:49.791
Thanks, buddy.
Can we get him inside, please?

16:49.878 --> 16:53.534
Just out of curiosity, what
would he have run that mile in?

16:53.621 --> 16:55.492
It doesn't matter.It kind of does matter.

16:55.579 --> 16:58.408
There's a lot of money
riding on the over-under.

16:58.495 --> 17:00.410
And, remember,
alternate ice and heat.

17:00.497 --> 17:04.501
Ice for the leg
and heat for my sausages.

17:04.588 --> 17:06.808
I'm in better shape
than I thought.

17:14.381 --> 17:15.556
Hey.

17:15.643 --> 17:17.993
Oh, thank God
you're home.

17:18.080 --> 17:20.169
[grunts, pants]

17:20.256 --> 17:21.431
What happened to you?

17:21.518 --> 17:23.346
I benched 210 pounds,Aw.

17:23.433 --> 17:25.087
carried Carl seven blocks

17:25.174 --> 17:26.654
and then Harry threw up
the biggest marshmallow

17:26.741 --> 17:28.047
I've ever seen.

17:29.570 --> 17:30.658
How was your weekend?

17:30.745 --> 17:34.227
Oh, well, you know, it was...

17:34.314 --> 17:35.358
Oh, no.

17:35.445 --> 17:36.533
Oh, yeah.

17:36.620 --> 17:38.709
How much did you lose?

17:38.796 --> 17:40.711
A lot.
Molly.

17:40.798 --> 17:44.019
And then I just won
so much more.

17:44.106 --> 17:45.238
[whoops]

17:45.325 --> 17:47.805
Oh, my God.

17:47.892 --> 17:49.633
Yeah, Vince is not the only one
with a system.

17:49.720 --> 17:51.896
Lay down on the bed.
I've always wanted to do this.

17:51.983 --> 17:53.942
[whooping]

17:54.029 --> 17:57.119
[chuckles]How much is that?

17:57.206 --> 17:59.556
Ten grand, which means,
like, $800 is profit.

17:59.643 --> 18:00.688
Ooh...

18:00.775 --> 18:03.517
You were down nine grand?!

18:03.604 --> 18:05.345
Just shut up and giggle!
