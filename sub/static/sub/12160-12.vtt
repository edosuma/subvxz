WEBVTT

00:01.300 --> 00:05.849
It's on... it's on...
It's on the hook!

00:05.884 --> 00:08.051
<i>Aah!</i>

00:08.086 --> 00:12.523
<i>#</i>

00:14.742 --> 00:16.076
Aah!

00:17.579 --> 00:19.863
Look at that! Aah!

00:19.897 --> 00:23.066
#

00:26.337 --> 00:27.704
Boom! Boom!

00:27.739 --> 00:31.208
#

00:34.646 --> 00:37.714
Oh, yeah.

00:39.184 --> 00:40.217
Who is this guy?

00:40.251 --> 00:42.219
Chad Bickle-- fastest rising star

00:42.253 --> 00:43.587
of the bass pro circuit.

00:43.621 --> 00:44.955
Wow.
Mm-hmm.

00:44.989 --> 00:46.757
Wow. What-- what does that mean?

00:46.791 --> 00:48.492
He's a professional fisherman.

00:48.526 --> 00:50.627
We signed him
as a celebrity endorser.

00:50.662 --> 00:53.597
The guy's turned
into a real, uh, bass-hole.

00:53.631 --> 00:55.199
Damn right.

00:55.233 --> 00:57.067
Look, he has half a million followers

00:57.101 --> 00:58.285
on his tweet or toot

00:58.319 --> 01:00.404
or whatever the hell that is.

01:00.438 --> 01:02.272
- You know, I don't know who said it, but I like it...
- Mm.

01:02.307 --> 01:04.825
"Fishing is the antidote to chaos."

01:04.876 --> 01:06.577
This guy <i>is</i> chaos.

01:06.611 --> 01:09.413
Look, you hired him.
I don't have to like him.

01:09.447 --> 01:11.982
Well, at least you can be civil
when you meet him.

01:12.016 --> 01:12.949
Which I hope is never.

01:12.967 --> 01:15.335
Yeah, well...

01:15.386 --> 01:17.588
Is he coming here today?

01:20.291 --> 01:21.791
Is he here right now?

01:21.809 --> 01:22.793
Look--

01:22.827 --> 01:25.295
Hey, what up, outdoor man?!

01:28.149 --> 01:29.733
Chad Bickle.

01:29.767 --> 01:31.702
Hey, Chad. Mike Baxter.

01:31.736 --> 01:32.936
- No, bring it in here, bro.
- No, come on. Hey!

01:32.970 --> 01:35.606
- Hey, look at that.
- That was nothing. Hey. Hey.

01:35.640 --> 01:36.607
Give me--whoa. Whoa.

01:36.641 --> 01:37.608
- Ohh.
- Hey.

01:37.642 --> 01:38.431
Yeah.

01:38.551 --> 01:41.201
Last Man Standing - S01E12
Moon Over Kenya

Sync and corrections by Gatto
for www.addic7ed.com

01:44.482 --> 01:47.868
All right. Here's the store.
Boating starts right back there,

01:47.919 --> 01:49.286
goes into a real trout pond,

01:49.320 --> 01:52.289
which I'd like you to stay away from.

01:52.323 --> 01:54.258
Camping is all in there.
A.T.V.'s there.

01:54.292 --> 01:55.893
Hunting is this big, long thing.

01:55.927 --> 01:58.295
My favorite area, the guns,
and of course, you--

01:58.329 --> 01:59.829
you're fishing. Right here.

01:59.847 --> 02:02.999
Yeah, I-I can't believe I'm
getting a tour of outdoor man...

02:03.017 --> 02:06.336
From outdoor man!

02:06.354 --> 02:09.840
Yeah, I can't believe you are either.

02:09.874 --> 02:11.975
No way. That's Chad Bickle.

02:17.448 --> 02:18.398
What's up, fellas?

02:18.449 --> 02:19.566
Excuse me, Mr. Bickle.

02:19.617 --> 02:21.568
Could you please do your catchphrase?

02:21.619 --> 02:22.886
Do you mind?

02:22.921 --> 02:24.488
Would it stop you?

02:25.790 --> 02:27.574
It's on the hook!

02:27.625 --> 02:29.025
Thanks, man.

02:29.043 --> 02:30.527
All right.

02:30.545 --> 02:32.296
Stay in school.

02:33.798 --> 02:34.965
That's my catchphrase there.

02:34.999 --> 02:36.250
Yeah, yeah. I got that,
'cause he said,

02:36.301 --> 02:37.501
"why don't you do your catchphrase?"

02:37.535 --> 02:40.087
And then you went and did
your catchphrase, so...

02:40.138 --> 02:41.805
Uh, Mr. Bickle?

02:41.839 --> 02:43.006
Kyle, please tell me

02:43.040 --> 02:45.058
you're not gonna ask him
to do his catchphrase.

02:45.093 --> 02:47.377
Of course not.
What am I, 10?

02:48.713 --> 02:50.230
Would you sign my stomach?

02:50.265 --> 02:52.933
And can you make
my belly button the dot

02:52.984 --> 02:54.101
from your "I"?

02:54.152 --> 02:56.436
This is a workplace.

02:56.487 --> 02:59.690
But I shaved my stomach
just for this moment.

02:59.724 --> 03:02.326
And yet you left all this.

03:03.595 --> 03:05.162
Excuse me.

03:07.749 --> 03:09.766
Yo, I gotta tell you, Mike,

03:09.801 --> 03:12.235
you got a pretty nice place here.

03:12.253 --> 03:13.704
Well, this is our flagship store.

03:13.738 --> 03:16.072
They're not all this big,
but this is one of our best.

03:16.090 --> 03:18.208
Yeah, well, you know,
it lacks a certain pop, though,

03:18.242 --> 03:19.242
you know what I mean?

03:19.260 --> 03:20.460
You know what
this place needs, Mikey?

03:20.511 --> 03:21.745
No.
I need a back-beat.

03:26.434 --> 03:28.752
Boom! Thunder and bass
like we do it in...

03:28.770 --> 03:31.471
South Beach!

03:31.522 --> 03:35.692
What--
what the hell are you doing?

03:37.278 --> 03:39.896
I'm just, uh, I'm trying
to create a <i>mood.</i>

03:39.931 --> 03:42.065
And what's the matter
with the mood we got?

03:42.099 --> 03:43.600
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

03:43.635 --> 03:45.268
The old guy with the fun accent said

03:45.286 --> 03:48.972
we could do whatever I wanted
to sell my line of fishing gear.

03:50.792 --> 03:51.958
I can't work with that clown.

03:51.993 --> 03:53.160
Come on, Mikey.

03:53.211 --> 03:54.277
No. I'm down there
two minutes with him,

03:54.295 --> 03:55.979
I feel like going on a killing spree.

03:56.014 --> 03:57.414
Come on.

03:57.448 --> 03:58.415
You're head of marketing,

03:58.449 --> 03:59.716
and that includes handling talent.

03:59.751 --> 04:00.967
Since when?

04:01.002 --> 04:04.855
Well, since I found out
how loud he is in real life.

04:04.889 --> 04:07.524
Look, he--he's part
of outdoor man now.

04:07.558 --> 04:10.260
We've invested in him.

04:10.294 --> 04:12.362
Why don't you invite him
over for dinner?

04:12.397 --> 04:13.963
Ooh. You know what?
That's a good idea.

04:13.981 --> 04:16.016
That's a terrible idea.

04:16.067 --> 04:17.017
You make your famous pork chops...

04:17.067 --> 04:18.601
With mango chutney...

04:18.636 --> 04:19.636
It's a bad idea!

04:19.671 --> 04:20.870
And those little
fingerling potatoes...

04:20.904 --> 04:22.022
- Done. Done. You got it.
- With, uh...

04:22.072 --> 04:23.774
Is anybody listening to me?

04:28.162 --> 04:29.546
Hey, who's
the extra place setting for?

04:29.614 --> 04:31.114
Oh, please say it's not that minister

04:31.149 --> 04:32.532
with the ponytail again.

04:32.617 --> 04:36.119
Look, I get it. Don't have
another baby outside of wedlock.

04:36.154 --> 04:39.840
No, it isn't,
but, seriously, Kristin,

04:39.874 --> 04:42.025
- Don't.
- Don't.

04:42.060 --> 04:45.996
No, it's just some young guy
that your father hates.

04:46.030 --> 04:48.799
Oh, well, that narrows it
down to everyone.

04:50.802 --> 04:53.570
Ugh. Oh, God.
What is that smell?

04:53.604 --> 04:54.938
Pork chops. Your favorite.

04:54.972 --> 04:57.173
No. Was my favorite...

04:57.191 --> 04:59.276
Back when I ate things like animals.

04:59.310 --> 05:02.813
Now I only eat
weeds of the sea.

05:02.847 --> 05:05.899
Okay, Mandy, what celebrity
stopped eating meat?

05:05.950 --> 05:08.051
Hey, I resent that.
Eating animals is cruel, okay,

05:08.086 --> 05:10.787
and I reached this decision
on my own, so...

05:15.093 --> 05:17.711
Olivia Wilde.

05:17.745 --> 05:20.497
But I decided to copy her
all on my own, so...

05:20.531 --> 05:21.865
Whatever. You know what?

05:21.899 --> 05:24.668
People always attack the one
who challenges the status quo.

05:24.702 --> 05:27.904
It's exactly how the British
treated <i>guh-handy,</i> so...

05:30.775 --> 05:32.542
Guh... <i>Guh-who?</i>

05:32.577 --> 05:34.277
Oh, um...

05:34.312 --> 05:36.313
Guh-handy.

05:37.715 --> 05:41.050
We learned about him in school, so...

05:41.068 --> 05:42.986
Not enough.

05:45.389 --> 05:46.623
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

05:46.657 --> 05:48.942
- Hey, dad.
- Dad, guess what?

05:48.993 --> 05:51.061
I'm a vegan.

05:51.095 --> 05:53.246
I'll give it a day.

05:56.501 --> 05:58.251
What, uh, what's going on with you?

05:58.286 --> 05:59.419
What's going on with <i>me?</i>

05:59.454 --> 06:00.537
Yeah.

06:00.571 --> 06:02.456
Thanks to you
and your opinion, we got...

06:02.507 --> 06:03.607
"South Beach!"

06:03.641 --> 06:05.575
Coming over for dinner.

06:05.610 --> 06:07.644
You asked me for my opinion.

06:07.678 --> 06:10.080
Well, I think your opinion was wrong.

06:11.415 --> 06:12.549
Oh, and of course he's on time.

06:12.583 --> 06:14.551
Oh, come on.
It's just for one night,

06:14.585 --> 06:16.052
- and I actually found him quite charming.
- Great.

06:16.086 --> 06:17.086
Ah.

06:17.104 --> 06:19.105
- What's up, mama B.?!
- Hi. Welcome.

06:21.359 --> 06:22.809
Okay, okay.

06:22.860 --> 06:24.761
Okay. Catch and release.
Catch and release.

06:32.193 --> 06:34.563
So everyone
in your family is a fisherman?

06:34.597 --> 06:37.583
Yeah.
It's kinda in my blood.

06:37.617 --> 06:40.085
Uh, my dad has a video
of me when I was 2

06:40.119 --> 06:42.254
gettin' dragged off a dock
by a sunfish.

06:42.288 --> 06:44.289
Oh.

06:45.291 --> 06:47.476
That's adorable.

06:47.510 --> 06:50.762
Yeah, my family has tennis
in the blood,

06:50.797 --> 06:53.765
lots of tennis.

06:53.799 --> 06:56.068
Anyway...

06:57.904 --> 07:00.939
So underneath all that yelling
is actually a human being.

07:00.973 --> 07:02.074
Yeah. No, I know.

07:02.108 --> 07:03.692
My--my public persona
is really extreme,

07:03.743 --> 07:05.777
but, uh, I don't know.
It just started one day.

07:05.812 --> 07:07.479
I caught this monster bass, you know,

07:07.513 --> 07:09.665
and just started screaming
into the camera, like,

07:09.699 --> 07:11.850
"whoo! Baby got bass!"

07:13.886 --> 07:15.420
Uh, I don't know.
I don't know.

07:15.455 --> 07:17.823
It was such a hit, it just--
I kind of ran with it, you know?

07:17.857 --> 07:18.957
Yeah.
Like you with your videos.

07:18.992 --> 07:21.126
I mean, nobody's really that angry.

07:25.098 --> 07:28.050
No. Certainly not.

07:28.101 --> 07:29.601
Man, this is great.

07:29.636 --> 07:31.570
I don't remember the last time
I had a good home-cooked meal.

07:31.604 --> 07:34.139
- Oh, thank you.
- You know? Usually I'm just driving from lake to lake

07:34.173 --> 07:35.507
and eating in the car

07:35.541 --> 07:38.977
and letting the wind dry
the hamburger grease on my face.

07:39.011 --> 07:40.512
How many lakes?

07:40.530 --> 07:43.065
Mm. Too many to count, man.

07:43.116 --> 07:45.200
Ever fished for peacock bass
in the Amazon?

07:45.234 --> 07:46.368
Oh, yeah. Many times.

07:46.402 --> 07:47.653
- Really?
- Yeah.

07:47.687 --> 07:49.371
How about taimen up there in Siberia?

07:49.405 --> 07:51.857
Yes. Y--oh, but you know
the one thing I haven't done?

07:51.891 --> 07:55.227
Fly-fishing
for black marlin in Kenya.

07:55.261 --> 07:56.928
Well...

07:56.963 --> 07:58.530
I did a photo shoot there.

07:58.564 --> 08:00.549
It's beautiful, man.

08:00.583 --> 08:02.901
- Yeah.
- Landed a 400-pounder on 16 weight.

08:02.935 --> 08:04.536
Yeah.

08:04.570 --> 08:06.238
There's nothing more beautiful
than the moon over Kenya.

08:06.272 --> 08:08.006
Was the time of my life.

08:08.041 --> 08:10.275
Hmm.

08:10.310 --> 08:12.811
Except for--for now.

08:14.747 --> 08:17.549
You know, I love you, baby,
but Kenya?

08:19.736 --> 08:22.621
Well, maybe Kenya
can make you pork chops.

08:22.655 --> 08:26.858
Ooh. Ouch. Damn.
Slap that bass. Yeah.

08:26.893 --> 08:29.695
You know you are my anchor, right?

08:32.664 --> 08:37.452
I'm actually planning
a trip to Kenya in June.

08:37.503 --> 08:39.287
Man, I'd love to go to Kenya in June.

08:39.339 --> 08:41.206
Honey, Mandy's graduation?

08:41.240 --> 08:43.075
Oh, oh, oh, yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah.

08:43.109 --> 08:45.377
Yeah, I'm kind of--
kind of anchored here.

08:47.980 --> 08:51.616
Boy, I'll tell you,
hauling in that fish in Kenya...

08:51.651 --> 08:53.885
That was the h happiest day
of my life.

08:57.724 --> 08:59.424
Our wedding?

08:59.459 --> 09:01.827
Yeah, you know,
the second happiest day.

09:01.861 --> 09:05.113
The--the birth of our children?

09:06.199 --> 09:08.200
Top ten.

09:12.438 --> 09:14.406
Excuse me.
What are you doing?

09:14.440 --> 09:16.074
Helping you be a better vegan.

09:16.109 --> 09:18.994
Yeah. If you can't eat animals,
you can't wear 'em, either.

09:19.045 --> 09:21.380
That's my go-to leather jacket.

09:21.414 --> 09:24.549
Sorry, <i>ga-handi.</i>

09:26.135 --> 09:30.138
If you're gonna talk the talk,
you gotta walk the walk.

09:30.173 --> 09:32.340
But not in these
leopard-skin booties,

09:32.392 --> 09:34.626
which, wouldn't you know,
fit me perfectly.

09:34.644 --> 09:35.960
No. No, you take those off right now.

09:35.978 --> 09:37.629
You put all my clothes
back where you found 'em.

09:37.647 --> 09:40.499
I will be vegan at my own pace.

09:40.533 --> 09:41.633
You can't stick with anything

09:41.667 --> 09:43.802
that requires
the slightest sacrifice.

09:45.137 --> 09:49.007
Fine. Take it. Take it all.

09:49.041 --> 09:50.942
You don't mean it.

09:50.977 --> 09:51.943
I do mean it.

09:51.978 --> 09:54.045
I, Amanda Elaine Baxter,

09:54.080 --> 09:56.665
believe we should end
the exploitation of animals,

09:56.699 --> 09:59.150
thus creating a more ecological
and humane planet,

09:59.168 --> 10:02.354
and perhaps I am
paraphrasing Olivia Wilde...

10:02.388 --> 10:04.523
But so what?

10:09.712 --> 10:11.196
And maybe you should ask yourselves

10:11.230 --> 10:14.099
why it's so important
to tear me down.

10:15.868 --> 10:17.836
Is it because...

10:17.870 --> 10:20.906
<i>You</i> don't believe in anything?

10:20.940 --> 10:24.509
And now I'm paraphrasing myself.

10:30.082 --> 10:32.818
So then, out of nowhere,

10:32.852 --> 10:33.985
grizzly pops up out of the water,

10:34.019 --> 10:35.787
grabs onto my salmon, right?

10:35.822 --> 10:38.089
So for a split second, I'm actually thinking

10:38.124 --> 10:39.357
"I'm gonna dive in here

10:39.375 --> 10:41.393
and fight this bear for my fish."

10:41.427 --> 10:42.828
You know?

10:42.862 --> 10:46.331
Wow, good thing
you weren't tied to an anchor.

10:50.036 --> 10:51.403
Honey.

10:51.437 --> 10:54.306
Well, no, just--if--
if he was tied to an anchor,

10:54.340 --> 10:57.041
then he wouldn't be able
to have all these adventures.

10:57.059 --> 10:59.210
Are you upset about something?

10:59.228 --> 11:02.781
Who, me? Anchor McGee?

11:02.815 --> 11:05.417
Why would you ask that?

11:09.071 --> 11:12.858
I think whatever it is, has to
do with the word "anchor."

11:14.360 --> 11:15.727
Are you all done?

11:15.745 --> 11:16.895
Yeah.

11:16.913 --> 11:19.197
All right. Excuse me.
I'll be right back.

11:19.231 --> 11:21.867
That was a great dinner, honey,

11:21.901 --> 11:23.084
and you know,

11:23.119 --> 11:26.621
when I said "anchor,"
I meant that in a good way.

11:26.672 --> 11:30.575
Mike, an anchor is
a barnacle-covered hunk of metal

11:30.593 --> 11:34.446
that keeps you
from going anywhere you want.

11:35.515 --> 11:37.482
You could look at it that way...

11:37.517 --> 11:41.970
<i>Or</i> it keeps your boat
safe and secure in a storm,

11:42.021 --> 11:45.924
which is how I feel
when I come home, normally.

11:47.443 --> 11:52.397
Except when I am holding you down.

11:52.431 --> 11:53.815
Look, you're not gonna
make me feel guilty...

11:53.866 --> 11:55.700
- Oh, yes I am.
- For all my travels.

11:55.735 --> 11:59.270
- I like traveling, as you can tell--
- No, no, no. No. No. Not this time. No.

11:59.288 --> 12:00.272
- Really?
- Yeah.

12:00.306 --> 12:01.806
- No, you're not.
- Yeah. Oh, yes, I am.

12:01.841 --> 12:03.341
No, you're not.

12:03.376 --> 12:05.043
Come here.

12:07.780 --> 12:09.748
You guys are awesome.

12:11.817 --> 12:13.184
This was like a private moment.

12:13.219 --> 12:14.302
I was hoping to get
a little action from my wife.

12:14.337 --> 12:15.687
What are you doing?

12:15.721 --> 12:19.124
No, the w--the way you guys go
from fighting to kissing

12:19.158 --> 12:20.859
is an inspiration.

12:20.893 --> 12:23.762
Reminds me of the way
me and Julia used to go from...

12:23.796 --> 12:26.898
Scrappin' to tappin'.

12:32.488 --> 12:33.772
That's sweet.

12:33.806 --> 12:35.941
- That's really romantic.
- That's...

12:37.693 --> 12:40.812
So, um, who's--who's Julia?

12:40.846 --> 12:43.715
Oh, she's the girl I left
when I went pro. Yeah.

12:43.749 --> 12:46.251
I loved her enough
to have some <i>brutal</i> fights,

12:46.285 --> 12:50.355
but I just couldn't handle
the relationship and the travel.

12:50.389 --> 12:51.723
Yeah.

12:51.757 --> 12:53.058
- Boy.
- Miss her?

12:53.092 --> 12:55.460
Not our business, honey.

12:56.929 --> 12:59.531
- Yeah, you know, I try not to think about it.
- Good.

12:59.565 --> 13:01.499
- Makes me sad.
- All right.

13:01.517 --> 13:05.003
I guess you could call her
the one that got away.

13:06.772 --> 13:09.741
Sounds like you're
a little adrift without--

13:09.775 --> 13:11.559
here we go.

13:11.611 --> 13:14.112
An <i>anchor.</i>

13:16.949 --> 13:18.750
Hi. Mike Baxter for outdoor man.

13:18.784 --> 13:19.851
It's cold outside, isn't it?

13:19.885 --> 13:21.920
But never too soon
to be thinking about

13:21.954 --> 13:25.740
my favorite activity, <i>boating.</i>

13:25.791 --> 13:28.693
Huh? I love boats--
big ones, small ones--

13:28.711 --> 13:30.095
all the equipment, I love--

13:30.129 --> 13:31.730
the big motors, the small motors,

13:31.764 --> 13:34.165
trolling motors, canoes--
I love boats.

13:34.200 --> 13:36.668
But one thing about boats--
no matter how big, how small,

13:36.702 --> 13:39.638
the most important part
of a boat is...

13:39.672 --> 13:43.041
The anchor.

13:43.059 --> 13:46.811
Like this beautiful galvanized
slip-ring model. Look at that.

13:46.846 --> 13:50.015
Great action, streamlined,
perfectly functional,

13:50.049 --> 13:51.049
thing of beauty.

13:51.067 --> 13:52.550
Coming out of the water,
dripping wet,

13:52.568 --> 13:55.353
it's like Bo Derek on a chain.

13:55.387 --> 13:57.405
Strong, functional,

13:57.440 --> 14:00.792
secure, and... on sale.

14:00.826 --> 14:02.694
Now you'd think
any woman would know the value

14:02.728 --> 14:05.296
of being compared
to such a device like this...

14:05.331 --> 14:08.950
But no, no, no.

14:09.001 --> 14:11.670
You know, all they hear is,
"you just compared me

14:11.704 --> 14:14.238
to a rusted piece of metal
on a chain."

14:14.256 --> 14:17.742
I said to her, "it can't rust.
It's galvanized, so..."

14:17.777 --> 14:20.879
Wow, did she not like <i>that,</i>

14:20.913 --> 14:22.981
but you can't really tell
when they don't like stuff.

14:23.015 --> 14:25.600
They just kind of shut up,
don't they? You...

14:28.888 --> 14:31.973
"You're not happy, are you?"

14:32.024 --> 14:34.859
They'll just hold on
to that stuff, won't they?

14:34.894 --> 14:36.561
You never know
when they're gonna pop off.

14:36.595 --> 14:38.863
I'm saying,
stay clear of the analogies

14:38.898 --> 14:41.933
unless you're
that Canadian guy, Buble.

14:41.951 --> 14:44.736
The rest of us just can't come
up with the right analogies.

14:44.770 --> 14:45.904
Just stick with the simple stuff.

14:45.938 --> 14:49.324
Go up and say what you gotta say
and run away.

14:50.826 --> 14:53.011
I don't think she's gonna like this.

14:53.045 --> 14:55.330
I think I should delete this.

14:58.584 --> 14:59.984
All right, gentlemen,

15:00.019 --> 15:02.954
the sound system is working,
and the press is here.

15:02.972 --> 15:04.806
That's terrific.
Thank you, Kyle. Thank you.

15:05.975 --> 15:07.959
Mike, thanks a lot

15:07.977 --> 15:09.360
for having Chad over
to your house for dinner.

15:09.395 --> 15:11.062
I would have had him
over to my house,

15:11.097 --> 15:14.299
but I...
Just didn't want to.

15:14.333 --> 15:17.902
Well, you know, once you get
past his screaming, he's, um,

15:17.937 --> 15:20.305
on the borderline of tolerable.

15:20.339 --> 15:21.639
Listen, we're gonna make a fortune

15:21.657 --> 15:24.159
off this screaming lunatic,
I'm telling you.

15:24.193 --> 15:25.160
Hey.

15:25.194 --> 15:26.244
Chad, how you doing?

15:26.278 --> 15:28.046
Hey, Mr. Baxter.
How you doing, sir?

15:28.080 --> 15:31.366
How are you? Uh, what's--
what's--what's wrong with you?

15:31.417 --> 15:33.651
What--what's wrong with him?

15:33.686 --> 15:36.121
W-where's his ridiculous outfit?
Where's that...

15:36.155 --> 15:39.124
If you just give me a minute,
I think I can explain.

15:42.094 --> 15:45.013
Is he going up there sober?
Somebody has to stop him.

15:45.047 --> 15:46.548
Hey, hey, oh, oh, oh.

15:46.599 --> 15:48.499
He's a pro he knows what he's doing.

15:48.517 --> 15:49.500
Kyle!

15:57.176 --> 15:58.143
Sorry. Can we cut the tunes?

15:59.278 --> 16:02.614
Thanks, uh, and thank you,
pieces of bass.

16:04.583 --> 16:06.417
Uh, last night,

16:06.452 --> 16:09.204
I spent an evening
with a wonderful family.

16:09.238 --> 16:11.689
Thanks, Mike--

16:11.724 --> 16:15.260
and, uh, it made me realize
everything I've given up.

16:15.294 --> 16:19.030
Well, no longer. I'm quitting.

16:20.633 --> 16:24.068
'Cause fishing ruins your life.
Mike taught me that.

16:29.241 --> 16:32.844
Well, that could not have gone worse.

16:40.374 --> 16:41.975
We're screwed.

16:42.009 --> 16:42.959
Calm down, calm down.

16:42.994 --> 16:44.561
No, not just a little screwed.

16:44.595 --> 16:46.446
I'm talking,
going-through-turkish-customs-

16:46.480 --> 16:50.250
with-a-bag-of-heroin-
taped-to-your-leg screwed.

16:50.284 --> 16:51.718
I mean...

16:51.752 --> 16:55.388
Enough about your stepbrother,
all right?

16:55.423 --> 16:56.889
Look, I'll go in there.
You stand out here.

16:56.908 --> 16:58.191
I'll deal with this kid.

16:58.225 --> 17:00.226
- All right, all right...
- Stay out here.

17:03.998 --> 17:09.069
Bravo. Great performance, Broham.

17:09.103 --> 17:10.971
So I guess that wasn't quite
what you were expecting, huh?

17:11.005 --> 17:13.607
Not quite.
I've been in marketing 30 years.

17:13.641 --> 17:15.258
I've never seen
anything go that badly,

17:15.292 --> 17:19.429
and we briefly had
a knife endorsement with O.J.

17:21.265 --> 17:23.282
Look, Mike, I know you're shocked,

17:23.317 --> 17:25.935
but I mean, seeing you
with Vanessa last night--

17:25.970 --> 17:28.288
it really affected me,
man, you know? Like--

17:28.321 --> 17:31.791
you guys are so great together,
it totally got in my brain box.

17:31.826 --> 17:35.261
Well, get this in your brain box.

17:35.279 --> 17:38.648
You signed a contract--
sell fishing gear for us,

17:38.699 --> 17:41.568
doing your persona thing,
not making people think

17:41.602 --> 17:44.471
they want to jump off a cliff
without a parachute.

17:44.505 --> 17:47.941
I just--I want to have what <i>you</i> have.

17:47.975 --> 17:49.042
Why?

17:49.076 --> 17:51.778
Because it...
Seemed really... chill.

17:51.796 --> 17:53.613
You're 23 years old, man.

17:53.664 --> 17:55.115
You get to travel,
do what you love doing,

17:55.149 --> 17:57.350
making a lot of money.
A family can come later.

17:57.385 --> 17:59.118
Really?

17:59.136 --> 18:01.221
Yeah, trust me,
the more money you make,

18:01.255 --> 18:04.224
the more attractive family
you can purchase.

18:07.645 --> 18:09.462
Drop some <i>ka-nowledge</i> on me, Mike.

18:09.497 --> 18:11.314
I mean, how did you know
Vanessa was the one?

18:11.349 --> 18:13.333
How did you know
that this was the woman

18:13.367 --> 18:14.734
you were gonna spend
the rest of your life with?

18:14.769 --> 18:16.603
Well, it's complicated.

18:16.637 --> 18:19.572
I mean, she liked the fact
that I liked to go fish.

18:19.607 --> 18:21.574
You know why?
Because it made me happy,

18:21.609 --> 18:22.942
and that made her happy.

18:22.977 --> 18:24.711
That's what I had with Julia.

18:24.745 --> 18:26.145
Listen, get ahold of Julia.

18:26.163 --> 18:27.881
Why don't you work it out with her?

18:27.915 --> 18:31.284
Yeah, I mean, yeah, I m--I could
give that some thought, I guess.

18:31.318 --> 18:32.485
Well, don't think about it <i>now.</i>

18:32.520 --> 18:34.537
Right now we gotta think
about damage control.

18:34.622 --> 18:36.356
This is marketing, dude.
You owe us.

18:36.390 --> 18:38.875
Gotta go down there
and tell everybody down there

18:38.926 --> 18:40.794
they were Bickle'd.

18:40.828 --> 18:42.929
It was a gag, man.
Let's do this.

18:42.963 --> 18:44.431
All right, all right, all right.

18:44.465 --> 18:45.548
You're with me--
you're right, you're right, yeah.

18:45.599 --> 18:46.833
The Bickle's gonna earn his nickel.

18:46.851 --> 18:48.301
That's what I like.

18:48.335 --> 18:50.020
- All right.
- I don't like this part.

18:50.054 --> 18:51.638
I don't like this.
This is not...

18:51.672 --> 18:53.172
Aw, snapper!

18:53.190 --> 18:55.558
Yeah, and let's work on that.

18:55.609 --> 18:58.194
I'll be right down there, all right?

18:58.229 --> 19:00.013
Yeah.

19:00.047 --> 19:01.648
Thanks for taking care of that,
Michael. Thanks.

19:01.682 --> 19:03.350
I promise the next celebrity endorser

19:03.384 --> 19:04.851
will be less high-maintenance.

19:04.869 --> 19:07.904
Yeah. Like we're gonna do that again.

19:07.955 --> 19:10.323
- Uh... Ed.
- Huh?

19:10.358 --> 19:11.991
What did you do?
Did you get somebody else?

19:12.026 --> 19:13.893
Um, I sent you an e-mail.

19:15.763 --> 19:17.630
No, I didn't.

19:23.270 --> 19:26.106
Hmm. Tony?
Meet Mike Baxter.

19:26.140 --> 19:27.841
Hey, Baxie.
Nice to meet you.

19:27.875 --> 19:28.842
Mike Baxter.

19:28.876 --> 19:30.560
Legendary skateboarder Tony Hawk.

19:30.594 --> 19:32.228
Yeah, I know who he is, yeah,

19:32.263 --> 19:33.930
but you know, Ed,
unless there's gun racks on him,

19:33.981 --> 19:36.383
we--we--we don't sell skateboards.

19:36.417 --> 19:39.285
Tony has a great idea
for an indoor skate park.

19:39.320 --> 19:40.353
Where would you put it?

19:40.387 --> 19:41.738
Uh, right downstairs,

19:41.772 --> 19:44.357
but I need some help moving
all that hunting crap first.

19:44.391 --> 19:46.276
He wants to move
all the hunting crap.

19:46.327 --> 19:48.278
Well, I'll let you two talk.
You figure all that out.

19:48.329 --> 19:50.580
Thank you. Thank you.
Yeah, we'll figure it out, Ed. Oh, boy.

19:51.615 --> 19:52.582
What's the matter?

19:52.616 --> 19:54.567
Oh, I got a little headache, Tony.

19:54.602 --> 19:55.969
You know what's good for headaches?

19:56.003 --> 19:57.437
Let me guess-- skateboarding.

19:57.505 --> 20:00.206
Bingo! I like you, Mike.
Bring it in.

20:00.241 --> 20:02.909
All right. Oh, boy, that's--
hey, all right. There we go.

20:02.927 --> 20:05.712
Who needs a chiropractor?

20:10.335 --> 20:11.834
So wait a second.

20:11.954 --> 20:13.140
You told him he could have it all?

20:13.191 --> 20:14.642
Well, I told him
he should make money now.

20:14.693 --> 20:16.727
Then he can have
an attractive family later.

20:18.279 --> 20:19.930
Like you did.

20:19.948 --> 20:23.567
I was just starting out.
I had to settle.

20:24.970 --> 20:28.764
You and me both, buddy. You and me both.

20:28.884 --> 20:30.994
You know what I'm saying kiddo,
a man does need balance.

20:31.114 --> 20:32.648
No matter how much you
love your wife and kids,

20:32.682 --> 20:34.450
there does come a time
you want to get away

20:34.484 --> 20:37.987
and just coat yourself in fish guts.

20:39.156 --> 20:41.157
You know, I've been
thinking about that.

20:41.191 --> 20:43.025
If, after Mandy's graduation,

20:43.060 --> 20:45.628
you still want to go off
with the guys to Kenya,

20:45.662 --> 20:48.064
I'd be fine with that.

20:48.098 --> 20:48.998
I love you so much.

20:49.032 --> 20:50.800
Yeah(Blows kiss) I love you.

20:50.802 --> 20:52.501
See? You're not my anchor.

20:52.536 --> 20:54.170
Yeah right.
I'm--I'm like a sail.

20:54.204 --> 20:56.439
Yeah.

20:56.473 --> 21:00.893
Or one of those--those wonderful
balloons that... is in Napa,

21:00.927 --> 21:04.263
and it floats over the vineyard
while you sip champagne.

21:04.314 --> 21:06.015
Eh, I don't know.
It's not...

21:06.049 --> 21:09.218
Those are actually really noisy
and quite dangerous.

21:09.252 --> 21:12.188
And if were to describe you
like that, it would sound like,

21:12.222 --> 21:17.376
- "my wife is a wrinkly, big bag filled with hot gas."
- Oh, God.

21:19.104 --> 21:22.154
