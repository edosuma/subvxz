00:23.040 --> 00:27.559
CAPTAIN JACK HARKNESS: Some sort
of morphic field suspended the human race.

00:27.680 --> 00:31.319
Cos this miracle, it's as if something
is willing them to go on.

00:31.440 --> 00:32.959
What's wrong with your sister?

00:33.080 --> 00:35.159
She's not sick. She just...

00:36.840 --> 00:37.799
...can't cope.

00:37.920 --> 00:39.759
Oh, my God.

00:39.880 --> 00:42.599
JACK: They're ready for a war.

00:42.720 --> 00:45.559
REX: No, they were ready
for the miracle.

00:45.680 --> 00:48.039
PhiCorp knew it was coming.

00:48.160 --> 00:51.559
I did visit PhiCorp, and they were
kind enough to offer me protection.

00:51.680 --> 00:52.799
In exchange for what?

00:53.880 --> 00:54.879
The message.

00:56.560 --> 00:58.399
Who are you?

00:58.520 --> 00:59.759
- They could have traced that handset.
- Yeah, I know.

00:59.880 --> 01:00.799
Come on, let's get the hell out of here.

01:00.920 --> 01:02.759
I think we got 'em worried.

01:24.840 --> 01:26.439
Sarah?

01:29.000 --> 01:30.799
It's me. It's Esther.

01:33.440 --> 01:35.079
Sarah!

01:36.440 --> 01:37.759
Are you there?

01:39.120 --> 01:40.759
(LOCK CLICKS)

01:47.800 --> 01:49.599
- Hey.
- These people,

01:49.720 --> 01:51.239
they were looking for you.

01:51.360 --> 01:53.199
They kept asking me questions about you.

01:53.320 --> 01:54.479
I know.

01:54.600 --> 01:55.799
I'm sorry.

01:55.920 --> 01:57.359
I can't stay long, but...

01:58.800 --> 02:00.399
What have you done with the house?

02:03.120 --> 02:06.999
- Where are the kids?
- They're in here, with me.

02:07.120 --> 02:09.399
- Can I see them?
- Esther,

02:09.520 --> 02:10.999
I'd never hurt them.

02:11.120 --> 02:12.159
But...

02:12.280 --> 02:14.119
- Mom!
- ...I can't stay.

02:14.240 --> 02:16.199
I'm leaving town. I've got to go today.

02:16.320 --> 02:17.759
Don't go to Boston.

02:19.040 --> 02:22.599
There's cholera in Boston,
they said on the news.

02:22.720 --> 02:25.119
Don't go to Philly either - dysentery.

02:25.240 --> 02:28.039
New York's got typhus and, um,

02:28.160 --> 02:29.919
- hemorrhagic fever.
- Sarah...

02:30.040 --> 02:31.959
that's just what they're saying online,
it's not that bad...

02:32.080 --> 02:33.679
But we've changed...

02:33.800 --> 02:36.639
all of us, didn't we?

02:36.760 --> 02:39.439
Something in the air...infected us.

02:40.760 --> 02:42.679
- Made us godless.
- Let me in.

02:42.800 --> 02:44.399
Let me see the girls.

02:44.520 --> 02:45.439
I'm not letting them out.
They can't come outside.

02:45.560 --> 02:47.559
- I won't let them!
- Let me in, Sarah, please!

02:47.680 --> 02:50.599
Mom, tell her to stop!

02:50.720 --> 02:54.439
Honey, I know this is crazy, but...

02:54.560 --> 02:56.799
you're safe, I promise.

03:00.240 --> 03:05.039
Look, I'm working with these people,
and we're going to stop this.

03:05.160 --> 03:07.439
I'm leaving town with them,
and we've got some things to do, but...

03:07.560 --> 03:10.079
I'll come back as soon as I can.

03:14.600 --> 03:15.999
Please...

03:16.120 --> 03:18.919
Please, let me say goodbye to the girls.

03:19.040 --> 03:20.319
No.

03:21.480 --> 03:23.279
- Mom!
- (WHISPERS) No.

03:27.440 --> 03:29.279
I'll come back...

03:31.960 --> 03:34.199
...as soon as I can, OK?

03:48.120 --> 03:49.839
(RINGING TONE)

03:49.960 --> 03:51.239
Hello.

03:53.160 --> 03:56.199
Yeah, I'd like to...report...

03:59.080 --> 04:02.639
There are two children that...
that I believe might be in danger.

04:02.760 --> 04:06.879
Melanie and...and Alice Drummond...

04:07.920 --> 04:09.759
...daughters of Sarah Drummond.

04:09.880 --> 04:12.159
Their address is, um...

04:12.280 --> 04:13.479
1 032...

04:15.120 --> 04:16.519
...King Sovereign Road.

04:17.600 --> 04:19.359
I'm sorry. I can't give you my name.

04:19.480 --> 04:21.679
I just want you to help them.

04:23.520 --> 04:24.759
(PHONE BEEPS)

04:24.880 --> 04:26.359
(ENGINE STARTS)

04:33.600 --> 04:36.519
Confirmed. I found Esther Drummond.

04:36.640 --> 04:38.639
The pathway to Torchwood's open and clear.

04:38.760 --> 04:41.599
Follow her to Harkness.
Do what you like with the others.

05:03.120 --> 05:04.719
And the miracle continues

05:04.840 --> 05:08.559
with healthcare throughout America
now reaching a state of crisis.

05:08.680 --> 05:11.559
The courts have been flooded
with claims and counterclaims

05:11.680 --> 05:14.039
as people adjust to a new form of life.

05:14.160 --> 05:15.639
I had a heart attack in October.

05:15.760 --> 05:18.199
The company replaced me,
but I can still work.

05:18.320 --> 05:19.719
It's not like I'm going to die, am I?

05:19.840 --> 05:22.839
So, if I have to sue them
to get my job back, then I will.

05:22.960 --> 05:26.079
Who is there to speak for the living
when the White House is silent,

05:26.200 --> 05:28.759
the Vatican is silent,
the scientists are silent?

05:28.880 --> 05:30.079
Well, I am not.

05:30.200 --> 05:33.999
In business news, pharmaceutical
companies are predicting record profits.

05:34.120 --> 05:36.639
PhiCorp has pledged a payback scheme

05:36.760 --> 05:39.359
in local communities
around its Los Angeles headquarters.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.879
REX: Ugh, 2,700 miles.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.559
Man, am I sick of your ugly faces.

05:59.600 --> 06:00.639
(SIGHS)

06:00.760 --> 06:02.119
Ugh!

06:05.200 --> 06:07.039
Anyone got change for the meter?

06:07.160 --> 06:09.159
Last thing we need with a stolen car
is getting a ticket.

06:10.280 --> 06:11.359
No coins.

06:11.480 --> 06:13.879
No, I've only got plastic.
You said no plastic.

06:16.960 --> 06:18.959
Hey, my man.
You got change for a dollar?

06:19.080 --> 06:21.799
Wow, look at the horizon!

06:21.920 --> 06:24.599
We've reached the edge of America.

06:24.720 --> 06:27.919
- (LAUGHS)
- Decades since I saw the Pacific.

06:28.040 --> 06:29.839
Must be about 70 years.

06:29.960 --> 06:32.439
Are you kidding
when you say things like that?

06:32.560 --> 06:33.879
Oh, ho-ho! I wonder.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.239
So, where's PhiCorp from here?

06:36.360 --> 06:39.279
Um, maybe about...ten miles that way.

06:39.400 --> 06:40.399
Technically, it's another city.

06:40.520 --> 06:43.079
PhiCorp headquarters is in Los Angeles,
and we're in Venice.

06:43.200 --> 06:45.839
We need to find somewhere to hide
while we plan the assault.

06:45.960 --> 06:47.959
Can't we stay here, by the sea?

06:48.080 --> 06:51.199
Not some stinking, dirty pit for once,
Jack!

06:53.120 --> 06:54.719
Please?

07:00.640 --> 07:03.759
WOMAN: Hey, man. Believe!

07:11.200 --> 07:12.759
(RINGING TONE)

07:12.880 --> 07:13.799
Can't get rid of you,

07:13.920 --> 07:15.959
- can I, dead man walking?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:16.080 --> 07:19.079
What is this "dead is dead" shit?
I see posters all over the place.

07:19.200 --> 07:20.799
It's the latest campaign.

07:20.920 --> 07:25.359
As if Oswald Danes wasn't bad enough,
this one's led by Ellis Hartley Monroe.

07:25.480 --> 07:27.559
One of those small-town mayors
trying to make a name for herself.

07:27.680 --> 07:30.039
- Where are you?
- Sorry, doc, no can say.

07:30.160 --> 07:32.879
But if I wanted to know where I could
get prescription drugs in Los Angeles,

07:33.000 --> 07:35.919
no questions asked, then you could make
your own conclusions.

07:36.040 --> 07:38.119
And that's the only reason
you called me?

07:38.240 --> 07:39.399
Well, you are the doctor!

07:40.520 --> 07:41.639
What are you doing in LA?

07:41.760 --> 07:43.319
I never said I was in LA.

07:43.440 --> 07:45.079
Well, it might surprise you to learn

07:45.200 --> 07:47.679
that I haven't got my own private network
of drug runners

07:47.800 --> 07:49.239
- on the West Coast.
- Come on, Vera,

07:49.360 --> 07:50.519
you'll find a way.

07:50.640 --> 07:52.759
I've seen what you can do
with the doctor-patient relationship,

07:52.880 --> 07:55.199
and the Hippocratic Oath,
it doesn't cover it.

07:55.320 --> 07:58.599
Ellis Hartley Monroe started the Dead Is
Dead campaign, and do you know why?

07:58.720 --> 08:01.679
She thinks we should treat people
who should have died

08:01.800 --> 08:03.279
as if they're already dead.

08:03.400 --> 08:05.079
And right now,
I think she's got a point.

08:05.200 --> 08:06.199
(CHUCKLES)

08:06.320 --> 08:07.719
I'm busy. Thank you, Rex.

08:07.840 --> 08:09.199
You are so going to call me back.

08:09.320 --> 08:10.839
I'm so not.

08:15.680 --> 08:18.239
WOMAN: We don't have all day, DrJuarez.

08:18.360 --> 08:20.639
This hospital has been empty since...

08:20.760 --> 08:22.679
'92, '93,

08:22.800 --> 08:26.519
but it's still in remarkable condition,
all things considered.

08:26.640 --> 08:30.039
So, if you could listen.

08:30.160 --> 08:34.399
Now, we have representatives
from City General,

08:34.520 --> 08:37.079
St Mary's, St Helen's,

08:37.200 --> 08:42.559
the Open Brook, Grand Maple Forest,
Attenwood's and Woolsey Heights, yes?

08:42.680 --> 08:47.759
All of you with ICU departments
stretched to the breaking point.

08:48.960 --> 08:50.999
This would be the solution -
we bring them all here,

08:51.120 --> 08:53.679
all the emergency patients en masse.

08:53.800 --> 08:58.599
Rather than have 1 5 hospitals at
maximum capacity, we have one...this one.

08:58.720 --> 08:59.639
But this place is abandoned.

08:59.760 --> 09:01.279
I mean, we're going to need
equipment and staff...

09:01.400 --> 09:04.199
All that taken into consideration,
but the strategy would work.

09:04.320 --> 09:07.039
So, we just put everyone inside
and close the door?

09:07.160 --> 09:08.959
Do you know what they called that
in the old days?

09:09.080 --> 09:10.879
- A plague ship.
- Let me stress this,

09:11.000 --> 09:13.639
this is a short-term measure.

09:13.760 --> 09:16.839
The plan itself would have
to be initiated by tomorrow.

09:16.960 --> 09:19.039
- That's impossible.
- That's not enough time.

09:19.160 --> 09:22.359
The people want a healthcare solution
and they want it immediately.

09:22.480 --> 09:25.679
Now, for most of the people,
Miracle Day is just that, it's a miracle.

09:25.800 --> 09:27.399
People are beginning
to move beyond the panic

09:27.520 --> 09:30.119
to the possibilities of a golden age.

09:30.240 --> 09:32.239
As long as the sick and the old
are hidden away from sight.

09:32.360 --> 09:33.319
Exactly.

09:33.440 --> 09:35.639
But let's not forget,
this isn't anything new.

09:35.760 --> 09:38.639
The Western world
has always hidden its unwanted.

09:38.760 --> 09:42.159
We signed on for that a long time ago,
before any miracles appeared.

09:42.280 --> 09:46.879
And you, you said yourself -
the plague ship is an old idea.

09:47.960 --> 09:52.039
Now...I have set up a schedule

09:52.160 --> 09:55.359
and I've made a list of transport
liaison managers. If you would just...

10:00.560 --> 10:02.919
Well, I'm not going to pretend,
it ain't nirvana.

10:03.040 --> 10:04.439
But if you want somewhere
with no questions asked,

10:04.560 --> 10:05.479
this is the best I got.

10:05.600 --> 10:08.519
Well, as long as it's got electricity
and a roof, this is all we need.

10:08.640 --> 10:10.279
Hot water would be good.

10:10.400 --> 10:11.719
I don't suppose it's any good
asking who you are.

10:11.840 --> 10:14.239
- We're travelling circus folk.
- Yeah, and he's the clown.

10:14.360 --> 10:15.519
I'm the bearded woman, but I've shaved.

10:15.640 --> 10:16.559
Yeah, you missed a bit.

10:16.680 --> 10:19.439
Cash in hand,
and there's more of that tomorrow,

10:19.560 --> 10:21.279
as long as
you don't tell anyone we're here.

10:21.400 --> 10:23.639
If anybody does ask,
you let us know straightaway.

10:23.760 --> 10:24.799
Sure thing.

10:26.760 --> 10:28.999
By the way, if you get hungry,

10:29.120 --> 10:31.759
there's a café on the corner
does a guava jalapeno cheese tart

10:31.880 --> 10:32.799
that's just fabulous.

10:32.920 --> 10:34.759
Laters.

10:36.440 --> 10:38.799
"Fabulous"? What is it with you?

10:38.920 --> 10:41.439
- You make everybody around you gay?
- That's the plan.

10:41.560 --> 10:43.879
OK, now we can use this place
as our delivery address,

10:44.000 --> 10:45.639
we can order that spare server.

10:45.760 --> 10:47.519
Then we start in on PhiCorp.

10:47.640 --> 10:49.279
But first thing we've got to do
is lift out

10:49.400 --> 10:50.519
- the security profile.
- (PHONE RINGS)

10:50.640 --> 10:55.479
Oh, sorry, I've got to take this.
Sorry. Um, yeah. I...just...

10:55.600 --> 10:56.879
Sorry.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.839
No, you know what Torchwood's like,
it's terrible.

10:59.960 --> 11:02.119
I mean, we're living in this...

11:02.240 --> 11:03.879
shed thing, and...

11:04.000 --> 11:06.399
there's no electricity,
there's no water.

11:06.520 --> 11:07.879
It's dark...

11:08.000 --> 11:09.599
and cold and damp.

11:09.720 --> 11:12.479
Oh! I thought it was boiling hot
in Los Angeles all year round.

11:12.600 --> 11:13.519
Yeah, well,

11:13.640 --> 11:15.799
- they lied, Rhys, they lied.
- (CHATTER IN BACKGROUND)

11:15.920 --> 11:17.079
What's that noise?

11:17.200 --> 11:18.679
- Is that people?
- Yeah.

11:18.800 --> 11:20.159
- Street gangs.
- (SEAGULL CRIES)

11:20.280 --> 11:22.039
Was that a seagull?

11:22.160 --> 11:24.719
Er...it's a woman,

11:24.840 --> 11:27.359
er...on the rampage, a mad woman.

11:27.480 --> 11:28.879
Anyway, so how's my little girl?

11:29.000 --> 11:31.079
Don't call me that, Gwen!

11:31.200 --> 11:33.079
You're very funny.
Do I get to say hello?

11:33.200 --> 11:37.359
No! It took me two hours to get her
to sleep. She was fretting like mad.

11:37.480 --> 11:38.839
I'm not waking her, so tough.

11:38.960 --> 11:40.839
I'm not on holiday, Rhys,
I'm out here working.

11:40.960 --> 11:42.479
Still, tough.

11:42.600 --> 11:44.919
So, what's happening with PhiCorp, then?

11:45.040 --> 11:45.999
Uh, yeah, things.

11:46.120 --> 11:48.359
Esther's bouncing this signal
off the Chinese satellite,

11:48.480 --> 11:50.199
so I don't want to say too much
just in case.

11:56.240 --> 11:59.199
There's one thing you have got
to sort out, OK? And that's my dad.

11:59.320 --> 12:01.679
They keep saying the hospitals
are full of MRSA,

12:01.800 --> 12:02.879
so can you get him out?

12:03.000 --> 12:04.159
That's impossible, honestly, now.

12:04.280 --> 12:06.679
They said on the news
no-one's allowed to move.

12:06.800 --> 12:08.239
But he's safe enough, Gwen.

12:08.360 --> 12:10.279
I have never felt so far away.

12:10.400 --> 12:13.079
Look, um, I just don't trust
the hospitals, Rhys.

12:13.200 --> 12:14.119
Please, there's got to be

12:14.240 --> 12:15.199
- something you can do.

12:15.320 --> 12:19.559
Look, I've got to go, OK? I'm busy.
They really need me. We're on a mission.

12:19.680 --> 12:23.719
Er, just get my dad out, Rhys, OK?
And I'll phone you tonight.

12:23.840 --> 12:25.399
It's already tonight.

12:28.800 --> 12:31.559
(PHONE RINGS)

12:35.480 --> 12:37.719
Torchwood located.

12:43.320 --> 12:46.119
- Sorry. Rhys. Sorry.
- We've all got family.

12:46.240 --> 12:48.759
The sooner we get this done,
the sooner we can see them.

12:48.880 --> 12:51.839
- OK, what do you need me to do?
- Right there.

12:51.960 --> 12:53.359
Well, this PhiCorp raid means we need
to lift out the security protocols

12:53.480 --> 12:54.799
on Jilly Kitzinger's files.

12:54.920 --> 12:56.159
Think you can do that?

12:56.280 --> 12:57.799
Mm-hm. Got Torchwood software
ready and waiting.

12:57.920 --> 13:01.119
- There is a lot of...
- You're obsessed with this bastard.

13:01.240 --> 13:04.119
I'm going to put a permanent trace on him
so we always know where he is.

13:04.240 --> 13:05.679
What about Kitzinger,
did we find anything more on her?

13:05.800 --> 13:08.319
She's freelance. She's been working
with PhiCorp for about six months.

13:08.440 --> 13:10.799
She's good,
but I don't think she's connected.

13:10.920 --> 13:12.919
She just happened to be
at the right place at the right time.

13:13.040 --> 13:15.759
Just like Oswald.
We're wasting our time tracking them.

13:15.880 --> 13:17.159
It's never a waste of time.

13:17.280 --> 13:20.479
Cos our greatest problem is that
what's happened to the world is invisible.

13:20.600 --> 13:23.799
But quite by chance, Oswald's
found himself right at the heart of it.

13:23.920 --> 13:26.559
George Eliot wrote this chapter
in Middlemarch. She said

13:26.680 --> 13:29.639
that if you take a piece of metal
with random scratches all over it

13:29.760 --> 13:31.439
and hold a flame up to the metal,

13:31.560 --> 13:33.639
the scratches look like
they're forming patterns,

13:33.760 --> 13:36.439
circling around the light.

13:36.560 --> 13:38.359
And that's Oswald.

13:38.480 --> 13:42.759
He's blazing away, and patterns
are starting to revolve around him.

13:42.880 --> 13:45.719
And all we have to do is keep watching.

14:07.800 --> 14:12.799
(SOFT FIZZ)

14:16.800 --> 14:19.279

14:37.440 --> 14:40.599
Got some statistics here.
You'll need to memorise them.

14:40.720 --> 14:43.399
The White House is planning
some sort of rally in Los Angeles.

14:43.520 --> 14:45.559
We might have to move
by the end of the week.

14:45.680 --> 14:50.839
But the good news is, PhiCorp has asked me
to stay at your side full-time.

14:50.960 --> 14:53.759
Evidently someone over there
believes you're important.

14:53.880 --> 14:54.919
Who am I to argue?

14:55.040 --> 14:56.079
Glorious.

14:56.200 --> 14:58.559
I'll bet that's killing you,
Miss Kitzinger,

14:58.680 --> 15:01.159
because you can't stand the sight of me.

15:01.280 --> 15:03.319
No, I can't. No, sir, not at all.

15:03.440 --> 15:04.919
But it is not my job to like you.

15:05.040 --> 15:06.839
I will find your coffee,

15:06.960 --> 15:08.399
I will accompany you to the studio,

15:08.520 --> 15:11.959
recommend whether Diane Sawyer
is better than Piers Morgan.

15:12.080 --> 15:15.599
All that and more, but between me and you,
it's your hands.

15:17.240 --> 15:20.639
I can't look at your hands
without thinking about what they did.

15:24.480 --> 15:27.839
You ever wonder
why anyone considers me important?

15:27.960 --> 15:30.639
- I'm sure someone's got a reason.
- Wouldn't you like to know what it is?

15:32.080 --> 15:33.399
Very much so.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.759
How much do you know
about our masters at PhiCorp?

15:37.880 --> 15:41.919
Because I did a little searching
of my own last night.

15:43.440 --> 15:47.919
It's been a long, long time
since I was allowed online, so...

15:48.040 --> 15:51.639
I tried to find out who's above PhiCorp,

15:51.760 --> 15:55.159
who owns them,
and the strangest thing happened.

15:55.280 --> 15:58.999
The information just scattered away.

15:59.120 --> 16:02.919
All sorts of names
and tangents and diversions,

16:03.040 --> 16:05.319
but nothing tangible.

16:05.440 --> 16:08.159
And that's
when I recognised the pattern,

16:08.280 --> 16:12.079
because I'd had a lot of experience
perfecting how to hide myself online.

16:12.200 --> 16:16.159
And suddenly, I'm looking
at someone else doing the same,

16:16.280 --> 16:18.239
but on a massive scale.

16:18.360 --> 16:20.239
Worldwide.

16:22.200 --> 16:24.519
I wonder why.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.039
Time to go.

16:30.160 --> 16:31.439
What for?

16:31.560 --> 16:34.199
Central News, 3.30. Isn't that right?

16:34.320 --> 16:36.799
If you would let me finish,
they cancelled you.

16:36.920 --> 16:40.039
Apparently they booked someone else.

16:41.520 --> 16:42.639
Who did they get?

16:42.760 --> 16:45.519
Ellis Hartley Monroe,
the darling of The Tea Party.

16:45.640 --> 16:49.079
She's been looped on Channel 55
all day long and she's radical.

16:49.200 --> 16:52.079
I think someone's got to say it -

16:52.200 --> 16:53.799
dead is dead.

16:53.920 --> 16:56.039
We are surrounded by people
who should have died.

16:56.160 --> 17:00.559
I'm sorry for them, yes,
but these people fill me with terror.

17:00.680 --> 17:04.199
Am I the only one brave enough
to say it? They should have perished.

17:04.320 --> 17:05.959
I'm sorry, but they should.

17:06.080 --> 17:07.839
And by persisting,

17:07.960 --> 17:10.799
they are draining the resources
of healthy, living citizens.

17:10.920 --> 17:15.319
Now, I'm nobody special,
but I'm a mother and a voter

17:15.440 --> 17:19.079
and an American, and I'd like
to think that that means something.

17:19.200 --> 17:20.679
This is what I want...

17:20.800 --> 17:22.079
Looks like you've got a rival.

17:22.200 --> 17:23.919
The Dead Is Dead campaign asks...

17:24.040 --> 17:27.319
You'd better think of a line, Oswald,
or you'll be yesterday's news.

17:27.440 --> 17:29.319
...and taken to a place that's safe,

17:29.440 --> 17:31.479
and I mean safe for the rest of us.

17:31.600 --> 17:36.959
The Dead Is Dead campaign asks that
these citizens be removed from society

17:37.080 --> 17:39.399
and taken to a place that's safe...

17:39.520 --> 17:42.399
All I got - a couple aspirin.

17:42.520 --> 17:45.079
Thanks.

17:45.200 --> 17:48.639
Haven't you got family in California?

17:48.760 --> 17:50.319
No, I'm from New York.

17:50.440 --> 17:52.359
But when you were injured,
I went through your file and...

17:52.480 --> 17:54.039
There's no-one.

17:54.160 --> 17:56.359
...I appreciate
that this is a delicate subject -

17:56.480 --> 17:57.879
don't speak ill of the dead...

17:58.000 --> 18:01.199
That's the problem with this job,
family always comes second...

18:01.320 --> 18:03.639
I said there's no-one! OK?

18:03.760 --> 18:06.239
...because dead is dead,

18:06.360 --> 18:10.999
and sometimes,
segregation is vital and necessary,

18:11.120 --> 18:15.519
because these living deceased
should not have equal rights.

18:15.640 --> 18:17.519
No, sir. They should be removed.

18:17.640 --> 18:19.519
They should be contained.

18:20.720 --> 18:21.759
And then they should wait.

18:21.880 --> 18:25.319
Because I believe their passage
to the afterlife has but paused.

18:25.440 --> 18:29.279
And when this miracle ends,
death will find them.

18:30.600 --> 18:33.239
Their time will come, and they will die.

19:22.880 --> 19:23.959
Getting these.

19:24.080 --> 19:25.719
You put them back, those are mine.

19:25.840 --> 19:26.799
Looks like stolen property to me.

19:26.920 --> 19:28.759
So what if they are?

19:28.880 --> 19:30.199
You going to arrest me?

19:30.320 --> 19:32.599
CIA agents don't arrest people, Dad.
You know that.

19:32.720 --> 19:35.639
Yeah, then...then what?

19:35.760 --> 19:37.159
You going to torture me?

19:37.280 --> 19:39.839
You people!
You've already ruined the world

19:39.960 --> 19:41.839
and now you want
to take away a man's livelihood?

19:41.960 --> 19:44.839
- Somehow this is my fault?
- You and your precious government,

19:44.960 --> 19:46.479
you changed the rules on us.

19:46.600 --> 19:49.679
Don't tell me
this ain't some damn experiment.

19:49.800 --> 19:52.679
I don't want to live for ever,
especially like this.

19:52.800 --> 19:54.679
Put the gun down, Dad.

19:54.800 --> 19:58.039
Don't you tell me what to do,
not in my house! Son of a bitch!

19:58.160 --> 19:59.079
- Give me that back.
- No!

19:59.200 --> 20:00.639
You're liable to shoot somebody.

20:00.760 --> 20:03.279
- It ain't even loaded.
- Really?

20:05.480 --> 20:10.239
Well, so what if it is?
I need protection living in this dump.

20:10.360 --> 20:13.239
But you don't have to live this way.
Don't you understand that?

20:17.440 --> 20:19.279
Don't you pretend to give a shit
if I live or die...

20:19.400 --> 20:20.759
Please, come on.
Please, don't give me that...

20:20.880 --> 20:22.679
- You never cared for anybody...
- Don't give me that.

20:22.800 --> 20:25.359
- ...and you know it.
- That's bullshit, Dad, and you know it!

20:25.480 --> 20:27.359
What did you come here for, Rex?

20:27.480 --> 20:31.679
Tell me that -
what the hell did you come here for?

20:31.800 --> 20:33.159
I...

20:42.040 --> 20:44.199
I got hurt, Dad.

20:47.400 --> 20:48.639
I got hurt bad.

20:52.800 --> 20:54.039
So what?

20:54.160 --> 20:59.479
I've been dying out here for 1 5 years.

20:59.600 --> 21:01.679
You never once cared.

21:18.840 --> 21:19.879
Get the hell out.

21:49.160 --> 21:53.759
So, to recap, there's over 1 00
dedicated servers identical to that one

21:53.880 --> 21:56.639
inside the PhiCorp building,
all containing corporate data.

21:56.760 --> 21:58.999
But...according
to Jilly Kitzinger's information,

21:59.120 --> 22:02.359
number 1 1 3 is a secure server,

22:02.480 --> 22:03.959
accessible
by only the highest corporate brass.

22:04.080 --> 22:05.679
- That's our target.
- And when PhiCorp

22:05.800 --> 22:07.399
says secure, they mean secure.

22:07.520 --> 22:10.279
I have never seen firewalls
like this before.

22:10.400 --> 22:13.439
Our only option is to steal number 1 1 3,
to physically take it,

22:13.560 --> 22:16.479
and cover our tracks
by leaving a duplicate in its place.

22:16.600 --> 22:18.839
- Which is empty.
- So, we damage it. Fire damage.

22:18.960 --> 22:22.839
PhiCorp will think the information's lost,
not stolen, and they won't overreact.

How do you like that, then, eh?

22:31.040 --> 22:33.959
All right, I can scout out the building.
So, how are you going to get me inside?

22:34.080 --> 22:36.039
I don't think so.
Not your mission, Agent Matheson.

22:36.160 --> 22:37.999
You're still on CIA lists.

22:38.120 --> 22:40.479
It's way too risky
to pass you through security.

22:40.600 --> 22:42.959
- And what makes you any better?
- Jack wiped us off the map, remember?

22:43.080 --> 22:44.439
He's got a piece of software

22:44.560 --> 22:46.399
that removes any reference
to Torchwood online.

22:46.520 --> 22:48.679
- There's no record of us, unlike you.
- OK.

22:48.800 --> 22:50.759
- Dead is dead. That's me, huh?
- Rex,

22:50.880 --> 22:52.439
you're a better strategist than any of us.

22:52.560 --> 22:55.359
Maybe you can figure out
what to do next. Check this out.

22:55.480 --> 22:59.719
This is the IT centre
where the servers are housed.

22:59.840 --> 23:03.439
Floor 33, maximum security,
completely enclosed.

23:03.560 --> 23:05.679
We need to gain access,
but it's restricted,

23:05.800 --> 23:07.239
with some heavy-duty biometrics.

23:07.360 --> 23:09.799
Only one man can gain total access.

23:09.920 --> 23:11.119
The man who designed it -

23:11.240 --> 23:13.399
Nicholas Frumkin.

23:13.520 --> 23:15.839
Well, what kind of biometrics?
I mean, what level?

23:15.960 --> 23:18.559
Every entry needs voice print,
palm print, iris recognition,

23:18.680 --> 23:20.199
by him and him alone.

23:20.320 --> 23:25.119
OK. Then I know exactly
what you need to do.

23:31.760 --> 23:34.079
Oh! Hey!

Thank you so much.

24:07.720 --> 24:10.159
Look at you! Wow.

24:10.280 --> 24:12.039
Oh, thank you. I must take that off you.

24:12.160 --> 24:13.879
Hey, doesn't she remind you
of our little girl?

24:14.000 --> 24:15.719
- Yeah. Oh, you should see her!
- We'd better be moving along.

24:15.840 --> 24:17.799
It's lunch hour, you know, so...

Her name is Sally Anne Louise

- She's beautiful.
- Thank you, I know.

24:30.360 --> 24:31.359
Got it.

24:33.360 --> 24:35.279
So, it was, um,
it was awesome meeting you.

24:35.400 --> 24:36.679
- Just super good.
- Yeah, you too.

24:36.800 --> 24:39.199
- See you around.
- Sure thing, hot diggity!

24:39.320 --> 24:40.959
See you later. Take care.

24:41.080 --> 24:43.079
You are so never doing
that accent again.

24:43.200 --> 24:46.319
I am mortified.
I'm absolutely mortified!

24:47.760 --> 24:49.679
- I thought you had a system!
- We did have a system,

24:49.800 --> 24:50.719
the system fell apart.

24:50.840 --> 24:53.719
St Helen's and Open Brook sent
all their patients here at the same time.

24:53.840 --> 24:55.719
- We can't even move them upstairs.
- Why not?

24:55.840 --> 24:57.759
Second floor - no electricity.

24:57.880 --> 24:59.199
This building has been abandoned
for 20 years.

24:59.320 --> 25:00.479
Then we got all the patients
from Conniston Drive.

25:00.600 --> 25:01.959
But that's a hospice!

25:02.080 --> 25:03.719
The hospices are closing down,
they're redundant,

25:03.840 --> 25:05.559
but their intake is still sick.

25:05.680 --> 25:07.759
So they just sent them without asking?

25:07.880 --> 25:09.399
You know how long it takes
to process one patient?

25:09.520 --> 25:11.639
Imagine what we're dealing with. Hey!

25:11.760 --> 25:14.199
The public's not allowed inside.

25:14.320 --> 25:16.479
Look, just take him. Take him!

25:16.600 --> 25:18.959
That's his books and his pills,
and he likes that old sweater.

25:19.080 --> 25:22.079
- You can't just dump him here with us.
- Yeah? Well, I'm sick of it!

25:22.200 --> 25:24.759
I'm sick of his piss and his smell.
Everything he eats, he throws up.

25:24.880 --> 25:26.519
Am I supposed
to look after him for ever now?

25:26.640 --> 25:28.719
I'm not doing it!
I tried, but I can't, OK?

25:28.840 --> 25:31.399
But... But you can't! Ma'am!

25:31.520 --> 25:33.359
(CRIES)

25:33.480 --> 25:37.559
Oh! That hallway...should be empty.

25:37.680 --> 25:40.759
Go and fetch Mr Holland.
This is disgraceful!

25:40.880 --> 25:43.439
Doctor, help! Help!

25:43.560 --> 25:45.679
(COUGHING)

25:46.920 --> 25:50.199
- Hey... Hey, why don't we get masks?
- I know.

25:50.320 --> 25:53.439
I'm sorry, but we haven't
got our procedures right yet.

25:53.560 --> 25:56.039
- Just give us a little more time.
- I don't want to lie next to these...

25:56.160 --> 25:59.199
- They're like corpses.
- I know, I'm sorry,

25:59.320 --> 26:00.319
but they aren't actually dead.

26:00.440 --> 26:03.679
- What if they're infectious?
- Can't you take the baby outside?

26:03.800 --> 26:08.039
It's not safe in here!
They keep talking about disease.

26:08.160 --> 26:10.879
- Is she yours?
- I don't know who she is!

26:11.000 --> 26:12.159
She's not my problem.

26:12.280 --> 26:14.959
She was just left there.
No-one's checked on her in 20 minutes.

26:15.080 --> 26:17.119
- It's not my job.
- For God's sake!

26:17.240 --> 26:21.159
There's no paperwork with that baby!
There's no ID! It's... This is ridiculous!

26:21.280 --> 26:23.319
Find Sally Richter.
Tell her it's an emergency.

26:23.440 --> 26:26.919
Tell her I say so -
DrJuarez, City General.

26:31.760 --> 26:33.959
VERA: Look at this!
And we're calling it a sterile area?

26:34.080 --> 26:35.719
Teething troubles.

26:35.840 --> 26:37.999
The transfer itself
seems to be working on the whole.

26:38.120 --> 26:39.719
Yeah, until we get cholera.

26:39.840 --> 26:41.839
DrJuarez, I told you,
this is a temporary measure.

26:41.960 --> 26:42.919
It's only for a short term.

26:43.040 --> 26:45.959
- Then? What happens next?
- I'm not at liberty to say.

26:46.080 --> 26:48.079
- I am on the medical panel!
- One of the panels.

26:48.200 --> 26:50.799
One of the many panels. One of the 1 5,
and that's in DC alone.

26:50.920 --> 26:53.639
I guarantee plans are being made,
and we'll make...

26:53.760 --> 26:56.639
No, that's not fair,
ladies and gentlemen.

26:56.760 --> 27:00.319
The slogan "dead is dead" is hardly
appropriate on hospital grounds.

27:00.440 --> 27:03.239
But this project demonstrates
the bold thinking

27:03.360 --> 27:05.079
that we need in America.

27:05.200 --> 27:07.359
Behind me, we have people
in the right place.

27:07.480 --> 27:09.159
It's as simple as that -

27:09.280 --> 27:11.839
people in the right place.
Behind those doors,

27:11.960 --> 27:14.359
they pose no danger to society.

27:14.480 --> 27:16.199
- Over here!

27:20.760 --> 27:24.239
- Tiny little problem.
- Those cameras were here for me.

27:24.360 --> 27:27.559
I know. It's just a timing malfunction,
that's all.

27:27.680 --> 27:30.879
The moment I lose my platform,
I get thrown back to the mob,

27:31.000 --> 27:32.239
and I'm not doing that.

27:32.360 --> 27:35.079
Do you hear me? I'm never going back.

27:35.200 --> 27:37.759
So, if you don't want me
angry with you, missy,

27:37.880 --> 27:40.399
if you don't want PhiCorp
angry with you,

27:40.520 --> 27:41.759
you're going put this right.

- Is that understood?
- Perfectly.

of Ellis Hartley Monroe,

a philosophy which is now
sweeping around the country.

She's put drug campaigners
such as Oswald Danes in the shade

27:56.080 --> 28:00.559
as her popularity soars.
The Dead Is Dead campaign has...

28:00.800 --> 28:03.719
This is why I need
your pledges and support.

28:03.840 --> 28:06.359
Not for me, but for the greater good.

28:06.480 --> 28:09.799
Because I want to fund
a programme nationwide

28:09.920 --> 28:11.799
that rebuilds our wonderful cities,

28:11.920 --> 28:15.839
that zones them
to redistribute the population

28:15.960 --> 28:18.719
in accordance with the miracle.
This would be a new America,

28:18.840 --> 28:21.399
a new world,

28:21.520 --> 28:22.759
a new heaven.

28:22.880 --> 28:26.079
Now, it seems to me we've relied too
much on the pharmaceutical companies

28:26.200 --> 28:28.159
or, as I call them, drug dealers.

28:28.280 --> 28:34.039
Companies like PhiCorp profit off
disaster, and I think that's wrong.

We'll keep these doors closed,
because this must be hygienic.

28:48.040 --> 28:50.399
See? Very hygienic.

28:52.320 --> 28:55.159
Brave man. I wouldn't go in there.

28:55.280 --> 28:57.319
Do you know who that is?

28:57.440 --> 29:00.759
I think that they are scared of you.

29:00.880 --> 29:02.759
- (COUGHING)
- But not me.

29:04.120 --> 29:05.639
I'm not scared of you.

29:05.760 --> 29:09.559
How... After all, how could I be?

29:09.680 --> 29:11.239
Because we're the same.

29:11.360 --> 29:15.999
Yes, we are. I am just the same as you.
Just the same.

- Oh, it's all right, of course.

29:19.760 --> 29:21.359
Of course. Here, hang on.

29:21.480 --> 29:22.679
Just a moment, please.

29:22.800 --> 29:23.919
There we go.

29:25.080 --> 29:26.999

You're the unwanted,
and there are people out there

29:38.600 --> 29:41.039
who are preaching

29:41.160 --> 29:43.839
all sorts of dangerous lies about you.

29:43.960 --> 29:47.799
And who is out there
talking on your behalf?

29:47.920 --> 29:49.239
Hmm?

...I will.

And you need security.

No, that's fine. I understand, sir.

31:01.160 --> 31:04.879

I have risen.

Torchwood is about to access
your secure site,

using your biometrics.

running this operation,

not going to check the road.
I'll be back.

Hi. Yes, I'm calling
from FBI police liaison.

by Susan Malpass.

35:27.320 --> 35:30.759

to check some details on, um...

let me see, the name's Drummond.

35:33.360 --> 35:35.359
Sarah Drummond, King Sovereign Road.

I've got it right here. Children -
Alice, seven, and Melanie, eight.

That's it, um...

we're just chasing an update.

35:42.680 --> 35:44.079
Well, they're in the system now.

35:44.200 --> 35:45.999
Right. I... I...

35:46.120 --> 35:48.639
- I'm sorry, what does that mean?
- It'll take a few days.

35:48.760 --> 35:52.079
They'll stay at Brayden Long Heights
until we can find them foster homes.

35:52.200 --> 35:53.399
We'll try and keep them together.

35:53.520 --> 35:54.799
It shouldn't be too much of a problem.

35:54.920 --> 35:56.159
I'm sorry, I...

35:56.280 --> 35:57.599
Are you saying that they've

35:57.720 --> 35:59.239
- been removed from the home?
- That's right.

This morning at 8am.

36:00.800 --> 36:02.239
I thought you said you were going
to work with the family.

36:02.360 --> 36:03.919
We tried, of course, we did.

36:04.040 --> 36:07.279
But it wasn't considered safe, and
the mother's been admitted for psych.

36:07.400 --> 36:08.479
She what?

36:08.600 --> 36:11.079
She's been under observation
in the psych ward

36:11.200 --> 36:14.439
under the care of a Dr... Where is it?

36:14.560 --> 36:16.839
...Dr Cottesloe, that's it.

36:16.960 --> 36:18.999
No report on file yet.

36:19.120 --> 36:20.639
Um, should be something in...

36:20.760 --> 36:22.079
tomorrow, the next couple of days.

36:22.200 --> 36:24.039
What happened?
How did she end up like that?

36:24.160 --> 36:26.599
- What did you say your name was?
- Where is she?

36:26.720 --> 36:28.399
Where is she now?

36:28.520 --> 36:30.559
I'm sorry, who are you exactly?

36:30.680 --> 36:32.079
Can I ask
what's the reason for this call?

36:32.200 --> 36:33.239
(PHONE BEEPS)

36:33.360 --> 36:35.599
OK... OK, OK.

36:37.120 --> 36:38.959
Access is fine.

36:39.080 --> 36:42.079
OK, let's see those two do their stuff.

36:55.800 --> 36:58.639
OK, here we go. Good luck.

36:58.760 --> 37:00.399
(SHE CHUCKLES)

37:00.520 --> 37:03.479
- (SIGHS)
- What is wrong with "good luck"?

37:03.600 --> 37:04.559
It's kids' stuff.

37:04.680 --> 37:06.719
Torchwood keeps treating this
like it's a game.

37:06.840 --> 37:08.279
- (PHONE BEEPS)
- Oh, I'm sorry,

37:08.400 --> 37:10.559
are we interrupting you(?) Who could be
sending you messages right now?

37:10.680 --> 37:13.119
It's just this thing. It's personal.

37:13.240 --> 37:16.199
- No-one should have that number.
- Shh, shh, we're in.

37:18.440 --> 37:20.119
- Hi.
- Can I help you?

37:20.240 --> 37:21.159
Yes, I'm here for the training sessions.

37:21.280 --> 37:22.839
Your name?

37:22.960 --> 37:24.079
Yvonne Pallister.

37:24.200 --> 37:26.479
International Sales.

37:30.760 --> 37:34.279
Only problem is,
I don't see any training going on today.

37:34.400 --> 37:37.519
I got an e-mail last night
from Lorraine in Human Resources.

37:37.640 --> 37:38.919
- I'll call them.
- OK.

37:43.840 --> 37:47.079
PhiCorp Human Resources.
This is Lorraine. How may I help you?

37:47.200 --> 37:49.119
Yeah, I have an Yvonne Pallister
down here.

37:49.240 --> 37:50.839
She says there's some kind of training.

37:50.960 --> 37:54.159
Yes. Send her right up. Floor 2 1 .

37:54.280 --> 37:55.719
OK.

37:56.920 --> 37:59.399
- Floor 2 1 . Go on up.
- Thank you.

38:07.480 --> 38:09.479
Hold up, hold up! Who are you?

38:09.600 --> 38:10.799
Delivery.

38:10.920 --> 38:12.319
I don't have anything on my schedule.

38:12.440 --> 38:14.639
It says Human Resources.

38:22.760 --> 38:24.159
Human Resources.

38:24.280 --> 38:28.199
Yes, our document shredder had
crapped out. We had to rush a new one.

38:28.320 --> 38:29.999
Send it on up.

38:30.120 --> 38:31.439
Sure thing.

38:32.600 --> 38:34.199
Go on up.

38:34.320 --> 38:36.519
- Need some help?
- No, I'm good.

38:42.840 --> 38:44.119
What's wrong with you?

38:45.320 --> 38:46.519
Nothing.

38:52.600 --> 38:55.199
Hello, handsome. Love the uniform.

38:55.320 --> 38:56.519
Ditto.

38:57.560 --> 38:59.519
- Come on.
- Oh, hold on.

38:59.640 --> 39:02.639
Whoever wears heels to work is heroic.

39:02.760 --> 39:05.159
Why do women put up with these things?
Look at them!

39:05.280 --> 39:07.839
The Fire Department's average response
time is 1 2 minutes. When they arrive,

39:07.960 --> 39:09.279
Esther's going to direct them
to the 1 4th floor.

39:09.400 --> 39:12.519
That should buy us another five minutes
before they start checking other floors.

39:12.640 --> 39:14.119
Let's go, mistress.

39:25.600 --> 39:27.199
(FIRE ALARM BLARES)

39:27.320 --> 39:28.999

Please place your right hand
on the sensors as indicated.

40:10.120 --> 40:11.399
I never thought that would work.

40:11.520 --> 40:13.399
Welcome back, Nicholas.

40:18.400 --> 40:20.919
- They're in.
- Good.

40:22.320 --> 40:23.679
You want to tell me what's wrong?

40:23.800 --> 40:25.719
My sister.

40:28.560 --> 40:30.679
Child Protective Services...

40:33.280 --> 40:34.879
They took her kids.

40:35.000 --> 40:36.879
- And they've got your number?
- No!

40:37.000 --> 40:38.759
I set up a relay.
It's anonymous, OK?

40:38.880 --> 40:40.759
- All right.
- And if you really want me

40:40.880 --> 40:43.799
to be heartless, Rex,
I'm the one that reported her.

40:43.920 --> 40:45.119

Little bastard.

40:56.560 --> 40:58.079
(PHONE BEEPS)

41:01.920 --> 41:03.439
Now she's on the telephone?!

41:03.560 --> 41:05.159
What the hell is wrong with you people?!

41:05.280 --> 41:06.359
Yeah, Anwen all right?

41:06.480 --> 41:07.999
She's fine. She's at home.

41:08.120 --> 41:09.239
Look, I know you're busy,

41:09.360 --> 41:10.639
but I was just phoning about your dad.

41:10.760 --> 41:12.119
- Is he OK?
- He's fine.

41:12.240 --> 41:13.199
Same as ever, no change.

41:13.320 --> 41:16.239
I just saw him and he sends his love,
but I did what you said

41:16.360 --> 41:17.679
and I made a fuss
about getting him moved.

41:17.800 --> 41:19.559
OK, look, I haven't got time
for this, sweetheart.

41:19.680 --> 41:21.159
Just tell me,
can you get him out of there?

41:21.280 --> 41:22.999
Yes, I can. Shall I go ahead?

41:23.120 --> 41:24.599
Oh, I love you. I love you.

41:24.720 --> 41:25.959
I love you. I love you.

41:26.080 --> 41:29.039
Just do it and leave me alone.
Oh, and give Anwen a big kiss.

41:29.160 --> 41:30.959
OK? Bye.

41:50.320 --> 41:52.359
- Good luck.
- Thank you, go.

Re-attach...655-32 1 .

42:04.600 --> 42:06.359
But still,
it must have been tough, though.

42:06.480 --> 42:07.439
There's nothing else I could've done.

42:07.560 --> 42:11.399
She wouldn't even let me see them.
She had the house all barricaded up.

42:11.520 --> 42:14.719
- Wait, you saw the house?
- Well...yeah.

42:14.840 --> 42:17.839
(SHOUTS) You went by the house?!
What if you were followed?

42:17.960 --> 42:19.799
Oh, my God, you're such an idiot.

42:19.920 --> 42:21.799
(SHOUTS) I'm doing my job, OK?

42:21.920 --> 42:24.639
And then 322 to 340.

42:24.760 --> 42:27.599
You've compromised the security
of the entire mission!

42:27.720 --> 42:28.999
Come on!

42:31.240 --> 42:32.879
322...

42:35.840 --> 42:37.639
OK, 324.

42:44.000 --> 42:45.559
- I've lost her.
- What the hell just happened?

42:49.280 --> 42:50.799
Gwen.

42:50.920 --> 42:54.359
Output from the I-5s goes dead
without consciousness.

42:54.480 --> 42:55.759
Oh, so she's unconscious now?

42:55.880 --> 42:57.639
- I don't know.
- I warned you!

43:17.120 --> 43:18.119
Gwen!

43:19.280 --> 43:21.239
Can you hear me?

43:21.360 --> 43:23.439
- COMPUTER: Are you all right?
- It's back!

43:23.560 --> 43:24.479
Oh, no.

43:24.600 --> 43:25.719
- Can you hear me?
- Oh, no.

43:25.840 --> 43:27.119
Who did this, Gwen?

43:27.240 --> 43:30.399
- Oh, no, no, no. Please, God.
- Goddamn it!

43:30.520 --> 43:32.319
This is all your fault!

43:42.120 --> 43:46.279
Come on, come on!
Esther, can you override this elevator?

43:46.400 --> 43:49.279
I can't. The Fire Department
has closed the whole thing down.

43:50.360 --> 43:51.679
OK.

43:51.800 --> 43:53.319
Rex, it's 33 floors.

43:53.440 --> 43:56.359
That's 66 flights of stairs,
and you've got a ruptured chest.

43:56.480 --> 43:58.559
Oh, man. Good luck.

43:59.880 --> 44:01.679
- Ah! Ah!
- Jack!

44:03.120 --> 44:04.559
- You OK?
- Yeah.

44:04.680 --> 44:07.119
- What happened?
- MAN: I did.

44:11.840 --> 44:13.119
I'm so sorry.

44:15.920 --> 44:17.439
Who the hell are you?

44:17.560 --> 44:21.079
- Names aren't important right now.
- Oh, great, he's cryptic.

44:21.200 --> 44:22.519
What do you want?

44:22.640 --> 44:24.799
Well, clearly, you're dead.

44:25.920 --> 44:26.959
Then why am I still alive?

44:27.080 --> 44:28.199
That's the point.

44:31.800 --> 44:34.359
It's got to be said,
Miracle Day's hardly been advantageous

44:34.480 --> 44:36.559
for those in my line of work...

44:36.680 --> 44:38.479
the day the killing stopped.

44:38.600 --> 44:41.799
But I can't tell you, Jack,
how wonderful it is,

44:41.920 --> 44:45.159
how truly wonderful it is,
to meet somebody who's...

44:45.280 --> 44:47.039
mortal.

44:47.160 --> 44:48.239
It's my Holy Grail.

44:48.360 --> 44:51.679
If he's the only one that can die, then
it's in your interest to keep him alive.

44:51.800 --> 44:52.999
That's exactly what I'm doing.

44:53.120 --> 44:55.479
Haven't you noticed
the absence of killing?

44:55.600 --> 44:57.079
Because this captain...

45:00.040 --> 45:01.439
...fascinates me.

45:08.080 --> 45:11.479
I've been paid to eradicate him,
but that only makes me wonder why.

45:11.600 --> 45:14.599
- What makes you so different?
- I don't know.

45:14.720 --> 45:17.519
And yet you're the only one left,
the only true human.

45:17.640 --> 45:20.279
If I knew, I would tell you.

45:20.400 --> 45:23.279
I'm trying to find out
the same thing myself.

45:31.160 --> 45:32.839
Yes, I know. Thank you.

45:34.680 --> 45:35.839
Who employs you?

45:35.960 --> 45:37.559
Don't you have any idea, Jack?

45:37.680 --> 45:40.639
They told me
it was a very long time ago.

45:40.760 --> 45:45.159
- Don't you remember?
- Wh... Who? Who told you that?

45:49.120 --> 45:51.239
This would be so simple
in the old days.

45:55.040 --> 45:56.719
Tell me what I want...

45:56.840 --> 45:59.079
- Oh!
- ...or I'll slit her throat.

45:59.200 --> 46:00.719
(PANTS)

46:00.840 --> 46:02.039
I keep wondering

46:02.160 --> 46:04.759
during these miraculous days,
would it be better or worse

46:04.880 --> 46:06.719
knowing that her pain will last for ever?

46:09.040 --> 46:10.359
(WHISPERS) I think better.

46:10.480 --> 46:12.279
- Leave her alone!
- (SHOUTS) Then tell me!

46:12.400 --> 46:14.999
I don't know.

46:26.640 --> 46:28.119
You're very special to them, Jack.

46:28.240 --> 46:32.399
They trust me enough
to tell me that. But I hear rumours...

46:32.520 --> 46:35.359
of miracles yet to come,
of a new society

46:35.480 --> 46:38.439
being forged here on Earth,
and I'd like to guarantee my place.

46:38.560 --> 46:40.039
So, tell me...

46:41.600 --> 46:43.479
...what did you give them so long ago?

46:43.600 --> 46:45.479
When?

46:49.120 --> 46:50.519
Tell me who's employing you.

46:53.080 --> 46:56.279
You'll never stop them...for this...

46:57.960 --> 46:59.279
...is who they certainly are.

47:00.400 --> 47:01.679
They are everywhere.

47:03.120 --> 47:04.079
Aah!

47:04.200 --> 47:05.199
(GRUNTS)

47:06.840 --> 47:08.239
Shit.

47:09.400 --> 47:11.519
They are always.

47:11.640 --> 47:12.719
They are no-one.

47:21.920 --> 47:25.399
They have been waiting
for such a long time.

47:26.920 --> 47:28.159
Searching the world...

47:29.240 --> 47:30.759
...for a specific geography.

47:30.880 --> 47:32.439
What the hell does that mean?

47:32.560 --> 47:34.399
That means that they've found it.

47:39.640 --> 47:40.759
And they've made it magnificent.

47:40.880 --> 47:41.839
(SHOUTS) Who are they?!

47:41.960 --> 47:43.239
They once had names.

47:43.360 --> 47:44.839
COMPUTER: Long ago.

47:46.000 --> 47:47.319
- And those names...
- (GUNFIRE)

48:01.880 --> 48:03.159
(GRUNTS)

48:03.280 --> 48:04.439
Uh!

48:04.560 --> 48:05.999
Oh, shit.

48:06.120 --> 48:08.359
(GURGLES)

48:13.560 --> 48:15.359
He was just about to tell us.

48:16.680 --> 48:17.959
Thanks?

48:18.080 --> 48:21.159
Anybody? Thanks?

48:21.280 --> 48:25.799
- And you shot him in the throat.
- Yeah, well, dead is dead.

48:30.160 --> 48:32.039
OSWALD: It's such an unfortunate phrase,

48:32.160 --> 48:34.239
"dead is dead", it's coarse.

48:34.360 --> 48:38.039
I... I know, as a survivor,
it's...hurtful.

48:38.160 --> 48:40.119
The last thing that we need right now

48:40.240 --> 48:42.639
is a campaign
that's going to empower the mob.

48:42.760 --> 48:46.879
The words of Oswald Danes are quickly
becoming a worldwide phenomena.

48:47.000 --> 48:50.799
Today the story of Danes
and the abandoned child truly went viral.

48:50.920 --> 48:52.759
(SPEAKS JAPANESE)

48:52.880 --> 48:54.879
(SPEAKS SPANISH)

48:58.640 --> 49:00.079
As the White House stays silent,

49:00.200 --> 49:03.759
we ask is Oswald Danes now becoming
the voice of the people?

49:03.880 --> 49:07.559
Is he the one true representative
of this miracle age?

49:07.680 --> 49:11.039
You are trending like never before,
you clever bastard.

49:11.160 --> 49:13.079
Miss Kitzinger,
you make it all sound planned.

49:13.200 --> 49:15.319
I was just trying to help
those unfortunate souls.

49:15.440 --> 49:17.479
Well, it's working.
Guess what they're calling you in France.

49:17.600 --> 49:19.519
The Sainted Danes.

49:19.640 --> 49:21.879
- (LAUGHS)
- (CHUCKLES) That's almost blasphemous.

49:23.320 --> 49:24.599
And now you're a definite
for the Miracle Rally.

49:24.720 --> 49:26.239
Flights are booked to Los Angeles.

49:26.360 --> 49:28.599
They want you to speak from the stage,
and guess who you're replacing?

49:30.280 --> 49:32.119
- Ellis Hartley Monroe?
- Ellis Hartley Monroe!

49:32.240 --> 49:33.559
Oh, she must be livid!

49:33.680 --> 49:35.879
We contacted the office
of Ellis Hartley Monroe

49:36.000 --> 49:37.599
asking for a response,

49:37.720 --> 49:40.719
but they told us Mrs Monroe
will not be making any statements

49:40.840 --> 49:41.919
for the foreseeable future.

49:51.440 --> 49:54.479
MAN: Mrs Monroe?
We'd like to apologise.

49:54.600 --> 49:58.319
We're really very, very sorry about this.
Indeed, we'd like to imagine,

49:58.440 --> 50:01.399
if time and tides
had flown in a different way,

50:01.520 --> 50:03.639
we could have almost been friends.

50:03.760 --> 50:06.759
I hope that's some consolation...
at the end.

50:09.080 --> 50:10.359
(SCREAMS)

50:10.480 --> 50:15.919
The truth of it is, we liked your message,
Mrs Monroe. We liked your style.

50:16.040 --> 50:18.839
But we already have Oswald Danes.
We don't need another.

50:18.960 --> 50:21.999
And certain aspects of your strategy

50:22.120 --> 50:24.679
were revealing our hand
just a little too soon.

50:25.960 --> 50:30.159
And we have been planning this
so carefully for such a long time.

50:33.560 --> 50:35.239
Because we are everywhere.

50:35.360 --> 50:36.679
We are always.

50:39.360 --> 50:43.319
We are no-one.
And soon, the families will rise.

51:06.640 --> 51:07.599
Anything yet?

51:07.720 --> 51:10.319
Oh...it's gonna take days, weeks,

51:10.440 --> 51:13.319
but I'm rushing through
a primary sift for basic patterns.

51:13.440 --> 51:15.439
- Good morning.
- Yeah.

51:15.560 --> 51:17.759
Thanks again
for saving my ass yesterday.

51:17.880 --> 51:19.079
I was saving herass.

51:19.200 --> 51:20.959
You were just gravy.

51:21.080 --> 51:24.079
- I'm sorry I made such a mess of it.
- That was your final warning.

51:24.200 --> 51:27.799
You give it any more thought?
That maniac said it was someone you knew.

51:27.920 --> 51:29.559
Not that easy when you've lived
through thousands of years.

51:29.680 --> 51:30.919
Going to keep talking that shit, huh?

51:31.040 --> 51:32.079
Got it.

51:33.760 --> 51:36.199
First basic pattern - land prices.

51:36.320 --> 51:38.959
Estimates dating back years and...

51:39.080 --> 51:42.559
they're all linked
to these construction plans.

51:42.680 --> 51:46.039
- Plans for what?
- They're calling them Overflow Camps

51:46.160 --> 51:48.479
for all the patients in ICU.

51:48.600 --> 51:52.439
Looks like PhiCorp's taking charge
of them, like they own them.

51:52.560 --> 51:54.799
Sold some kind of strategy to the UN.

51:54.920 --> 51:58.359
PhiCorp and whoever else is behind them.
But what the hell are they up to?

51:58.480 --> 51:59.679
Whatever it is, I bet it ain't good.

51:59.800 --> 52:01.519
- (PHONE RINGS)
- Bollocks! Bollocks!

52:01.640 --> 52:04.839
I am so, so sorry. I have been so busy,
I didn't ring you back.

52:04.960 --> 52:06.319
But look, I'm going call you back
in half an hour,

52:06.440 --> 52:07.359
and that is a promise.

52:07.480 --> 52:09.159
Calm down! Don't worry.

52:09.280 --> 52:11.239
I'm phoning with good news, that's all.
It's about your dad.

52:11.360 --> 52:13.399
- What is it? What's happened?
- I said it's good news.

52:13.520 --> 52:15.839
Now, stop and listen, you daft thing.

52:15.960 --> 52:17.359
I've got him onto that scheme,
top of the list.

52:17.480 --> 52:18.999
- What scheme?
- Government's stepped in

52:19.120 --> 52:20.599
to prop up the NHS.

52:20.720 --> 52:22.199
They're spending millions, they said.

52:22.320 --> 52:23.959
They're building these sort of camps

52:24.080 --> 52:25.679
- to help people.
- Overflow Camps?

52:25.800 --> 52:28.239
Aye, that's it. And I got your dad
inside the South Wales site.

52:28.360 --> 52:31.519
OK, Rhys, listen to me.
Do not let them go. Do not let them

52:31.640 --> 52:33.319
take my father.
I haven't got time to explain.

52:33.440 --> 52:35.039
Just... Just bloody move!

52:35.160 --> 52:36.959
- They just moved him out.
- Then stop them.

52:37.080 --> 52:38.239
OK? This is bloody PhiCorp, Rhys,

52:38.360 --> 52:39.759
and they are up to something.

52:39.880 --> 52:41.919
(SIRENS WAIL)

52:43.960 --> 52:45.839
Move! Don't let them go! Just...

52:45.960 --> 52:49.039
get him back. Get him back now!

52:53.840 --> 52:54.959
Gwen?

52:55.080 --> 52:56.319
It's too late.

52:56.440 --> 52:58.639
They've got my dad, Jack.

52:59.840 --> 53:01.199
They've got my dad.

53:07.560 --> 53:10.039
If anyone ever hears this,

53:10.160 --> 53:12.439
we thought
we knew what we were doing,

53:12.560 --> 53:15.919
all of us, this new Torchwood team.

53:16.040 --> 53:18.239
We thought we knew
what was happening with PhiCorp

53:18.360 --> 53:21.199
and America and my dad

53:21.320 --> 53:22.199
and everything.

53:22.320 --> 53:24.519
And then we discovered the truth.

53:24.640 --> 53:28.279
Because then we found out
what was really happening...

53:28.400 --> 53:32.039
what this miracle really means.

53:32.160 --> 53:33.879
And now it's too late.

53:34.000 --> 53:35.359
We can't stop it.

53:35.480 --> 53:39.559
It's happening
across the whole wide world.

53:40.520 --> 53:42.159
God help us all.

53:44.680 --> 53:47.279
(WHISPERS) And I am sorry, Dad.
