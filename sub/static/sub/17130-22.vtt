WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:02.970
HELLO, EVERYONE.
HEY, DADDY.

00:02.970 --> 00:04.805
SON.

00:04.805 --> 00:06.674
AH, IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY, EH?

00:06.674 --> 00:10.444
THE SUN IS BRIGHTER,
AND THE ROSES SMELL FRESHER.

00:10.444 --> 00:13.681
AND DOES ANYONE KNOW WHY?

00:13.681 --> 00:15.549
YOU CLIPPED YOUR EYEBROWS
AND MUSTACHE

00:15.549 --> 00:17.718
SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE
AND SMELL THINGS NOW?

00:17.718 --> 00:21.722
MOCK ALL YOU WANT,
BUT I CAN'T HEAR YOU TODAY.

00:21.722 --> 00:23.557
WHILE YOU HAD
THE TRIMMERS OUT, BRO,

00:23.557 --> 00:25.193
YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE
YOUR EARS, MAN.

00:25.193 --> 00:29.363
I MET THE LOVE
OF MY LIFE ONLINE.

00:29.363 --> 00:33.101
HER NAME IS LINDSAY,
AND SHE'S PERFECT.

00:33.101 --> 00:35.236
WELL, SHE HAS ONE FLAW.

00:35.236 --> 00:39.273
HER BREASTS ARE SLIGHTLY LARGER
THAN I AM USED TO.

00:39.273 --> 00:44.745
BUT, OH, WELL, I GUESS
I'LL HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT.

00:44.745 --> 00:47.848
DADDY, HOW DO YOU KNOW
YOU'RE IN LOVE?

00:47.848 --> 00:50.284
HOW MANY TIMES
HAVE YOU GONE OUT WITH HER?

00:50.284 --> 00:53.554
LAST NIGHT WAS OUR FIRST DATE,
AND IT WAS MAGICAL.

00:53.554 --> 00:56.990
SHE SAYS I AM THE MOST
HANDSOME MAN SHE'D EVER SEEN.

00:56.990 --> 00:58.492
OH, THAT'S SO NICE.

00:58.492 --> 01:00.594
SO WHEN YOU
KISSED HER GOOD NIGHT,

01:00.594 --> 01:04.365
DID HER SEEING EYE DOG
GROWL?

01:04.365 --> 01:07.235
SHE'S NOT BLIND,
SHE'S CRAZY ABOUT ME,

01:07.235 --> 01:09.403
AND WE ARE GOING OUT
AGAIN TONIGHT.

01:09.403 --> 01:12.005
YOU, HOWEVER,
WILL DIE ALONE

01:12.005 --> 01:14.808
WITH YOUR UNDERWEAR
FULL OF COBWEBS.

01:16.944 --> 01:18.912
(Angie)
YOU KNOW, BENNY...

01:18.912 --> 01:20.548
THE INTERNET MIGHT BE

01:20.548 --> 01:23.284
THE PERFECT WAY
FOR YOU TO MEET A MAN.

01:23.284 --> 01:26.053
I GOT MY OWN WAYS
OF MEETING MEN.

01:26.053 --> 01:28.822
I DRINK UNTIL THEY LOOK LIKE
TOM SELLECK.

01:28.822 --> 01:31.725
BUT YOU HAVEN'T HAD A REAL
RELATIONSHIP IN OVER A YEAR.

01:31.725 --> 01:34.662
MAYBE IT'S TIME
TO THROW YOUR NET OUT THERE

01:34.662 --> 01:37.431
AND SEE WHAT YOU CAN CATCH.
ANGIE, PLEASE.

01:37.431 --> 01:40.301
MY MOM'S ALREADY CAUGHT ENOUGH
THINGS FROM DATING.

01:42.303 --> 01:43.771
GEORGE...

01:43.771 --> 01:46.540
YOUR MOM'S PERFECT MAN
MIGHT NOT BE IN L.A.

01:46.540 --> 01:49.610
HE COULD BE IN A TRAILER
IN NORTH CAROLINA

01:49.610 --> 01:53.881
OR A TRAILER IN WYOMING
OR A TRAILER IN ALABAMA.

01:53.881 --> 01:58.386
I GOT IT--
"OPERATION TAKE OUT THE TRASH."

01:58.386 --> 02:00.288
LOOK AT THAT.

02:00.288 --> 02:02.423
THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF MEN
ON THIS WEB SITE

02:02.423 --> 02:03.824
IN YOUR AGE RANGE.

02:03.824 --> 02:05.793
MOM, COME ON,
LET'S FIND YOUR DREAM MAN.

02:05.793 --> 02:08.429
I'M NOT GONNA DO THIS.
I DON'T NEED HELP MEETING A MAN.

02:08.429 --> 02:10.864
YOU NEED HELP
MEETING A GOOD MAN.

02:10.864 --> 02:14.034
SOMEBODY THAT DOESN'T TURN
TO YOU AT LAST CALL AND SAY,

02:14.034 --> 02:17.838
"HEY, BUDDY, WHY DON'T WE GO OUT
AND GET A COUPLE CHICKS?"

02:25.746 --> 02:27.748
YOU KNOW WHAT?

02:27.748 --> 02:30.418
IT WOULD BE NICE
TO MEET A GOOD MAN--

02:30.418 --> 02:33.454
A GUY WHO WOULDN'T INTERRUPT
THE DATE EVERY FIVE MINUTES

02:33.454 --> 02:37.090
TO GO CALL HIS WIFE.

02:37.090 --> 02:39.960
OKAY, LOOK,
HERE'S A PROFILE BUILDER

02:39.960 --> 02:42.530
WITH A BUNCH OF QUESTIONS.

02:42.530 --> 02:45.065
ALL RIGHT.
PREFERRED AGE RANGE?

02:45.065 --> 02:49.437
UM, LEGAL AND UP.

02:49.437 --> 02:52.273
WHAT'S YOUR IDEA
OF A FUN DATE?

02:52.273 --> 02:55.609
COCKFIGHTS ARE FUN.

02:55.609 --> 02:59.713
I'M GONNA PUT DOWN
BIRD-WATCHING.

02:59.713 --> 03:03.851
HOBBIES?
DRINKING, SMOKING, GAMBLING.

03:03.851 --> 03:06.920
IDEAL COMPANION?

03:06.920 --> 03:09.357
DRINKER, SMOKER, GAMBLER.

03:11.024 --> 03:12.660
LET'S SEE IF WE HAVE
ANY MATCHES.

03:12.660 --> 03:14.895
HEY, LOOK AT THAT.
THREE GUYS CAME UP.

03:14.895 --> 03:17.164
LET'S SEE THEIR PICTURES.
ALL RIGHT, THERE'S ONE.

03:17.164 --> 03:19.132
OH.
OH.

03:19.132 --> 03:21.569
NEXT ONE.

03:21.569 --> 03:23.170
UGH...

03:23.170 --> 03:24.705
ALL RIGHT...

03:24.705 --> 03:26.139
AY.

03:26.139 --> 03:29.443
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT, MOM?

03:29.443 --> 03:32.212
HERE'S $30.
TOM SELLECK'S ON ME TONIGHT.

03:37.551 --> 03:42.290
HEY, DAD, WHEN CAN I HAVE
MY FIRST BEER?

03:42.290 --> 03:46.427
WHEN YOU'RE 21.
BUT MOST OF MY FRIENDS
HAVE ALREADY GOTTEN DRUNK.

03:46.427 --> 03:48.128
I WANNA SEE
WHAT IT FEELS LIKE.

03:48.128 --> 03:50.664
LET ME TELL YOU A TRAGIC STORY
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO SOMEONE

03:50.664 --> 03:53.634
WHO STARTED DRINKING
AT YOUR AGE--GRANDMA. THE END.

03:58.906 --> 04:02.042
EDDIE?

04:02.042 --> 04:04.244
EDDIE CARTER, RIGHT?

04:04.244 --> 04:05.979
YEAH. DO I KNOW YOU?

04:05.979 --> 04:07.981
GEORGE LOPEZ.
REMEMBER, YOU USED TO GO OUT

04:07.981 --> 04:10.183
WITH MY MOM BENNY
WHEN I WAS A KID?

04:10.183 --> 04:13.321
OH, YEAH! LITTLE GEORGE.

04:13.321 --> 04:14.888
MAN, I REMEMBER
WHEN YOU WERE A KID,

04:14.888 --> 04:18.926
AND YOU HAD A SKINNY BODY
AND A GIANT HEAD.

04:21.094 --> 04:25.165
NOW... YOU'RE OLDER.

04:25.165 --> 04:26.867
THIS IS MY SON MAX.

04:26.867 --> 04:29.870
THIS GUY IS GREAT. WHEN HE WAS
GOING OUT WITH YOUR GRANDMA,

04:29.870 --> 04:31.905
HE USED TO TAKE ME
TO DODGER GAMES,

04:31.905 --> 04:34.041
BOUGHT ME HOT DOGS,
SOUVENIRS--

04:34.041 --> 04:36.677
HE BOUGHT ME MY FIRST BEER
WHEN I WAS 14...

04:36.677 --> 04:41.081
INNINGS INTO A GREAT GAME
ON MY 21st BIRTHDAY.

04:41.081 --> 04:43.384
SO, UH...

04:43.384 --> 04:45.052
HOW'S YOUR MOM?

04:45.052 --> 04:46.854
I BET SHE LEFT THE FACTORY,

04:46.854 --> 04:49.222
SETTLED DOWN
AND MARRIED A GOOD MAN.

04:49.222 --> 04:51.892
YOU KNOW, SORT OF. I MEAN,
SHE'S STILL AT THE FACTORY,

04:51.892 --> 04:54.728
HER HOUSE BURNED DOWN,
AND SHE GOT LEFT AT THE ALTAR,

04:54.728 --> 04:57.097
SO IT'S NOT THE WORST YEAR
SHE'S EVER HAD.

04:57.097 --> 04:59.367
WHAT ABOUT YOU, EDDIE?
YOU EVER GET MARRIED?

04:59.367 --> 05:02.836
YEAH, A COUPLE OF TIMES,
BUT IT DIDN'T WORK OUT.

05:02.836 --> 05:05.573
I'LL NEVER FIND
ANOTHER WOMAN LIKE YOUR MOM.

05:05.573 --> 05:08.275
WHERE YOU BEEN LOOKING?

05:08.275 --> 05:11.211
HEY, I KNOW YOU GUYS
HAD SOME ROUGH TIMES,

05:11.211 --> 05:12.913
BUT BENNY WAS ALL RIGHT.

05:12.913 --> 05:16.784
WHEN YOU SEE HER,
TELL HER I MISS HER.

05:16.784 --> 05:20.488
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT, EDDIE?
WHY DON'T YOU TELL HER YOURSELF?

05:20.488 --> 05:22.656
I'M HAVING A BARBECUE
AT MY HOUSE TONIGHT.

05:22.656 --> 05:25.125
SHE'LL BE THERE.
WHY DON'T YOU COME ON OVER?

05:25.125 --> 05:28.696
OH, THANKS, GEORGE.
IT'D BE NICE TO SEE BENNY AGAIN.

05:28.696 --> 05:31.264
SHE WAS ONE CLASSY LADY.

05:31.264 --> 05:33.300
JUST TO BE SURE...

05:33.300 --> 05:34.968
THIS IS MY MOM, RIGHT?

05:34.968 --> 05:37.471
THIS IS THE BENNY
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT?

05:37.471 --> 05:38.972
YEAH, THAT'S HER.

05:38.972 --> 05:42.443
MAN, SHE GOT
BETTER-LOOKING WITH AGE.

05:42.443 --> 05:45.245
HOW MANY FINGERS
AM I HOLDING UP?

05:45.245 --> 05:47.147
THREE.

05:47.147 --> 05:48.649
ARE YOU ON MEDICATION?
NO.

05:48.649 --> 05:51.452
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT.
OKAY.

05:56.790 --> 06:00.694
GIVE ME ALL THE MONEY
IN YOUR REGISTER! NOW!

06:00.694 --> 06:04.932
OH, AND A BOTTLE OF WINE
AND SOME FLOWERS.

06:04.932 --> 06:06.900
I GOT A DATE TONIGHT.

06:07.835 --> 06:10.971
(War's "Low Rider" playing)

06:14.207 --> 06:17.344
* ALL MY FRIENDS

06:17.344 --> 06:20.448
* KNOW THE LOW RIDER

06:29.890 --> 06:31.659
(Carmen) MOM?

06:31.659 --> 06:35.328
MOM, I JUST GOT MY LETTERS FROM
NORTHWESTERN, IOWA AND COLUMBIA.

06:35.328 --> 06:37.431
OH, IT'S GONNA BE
A TOUGH CHOICE.

06:37.431 --> 06:39.533
THEY'RE ALL GREAT COLLEGES!

06:39.533 --> 06:41.735
OH! NORTHWESTERN,
MY FIRST CHOICE.

06:41.735 --> 06:44.605
THE ONLY SCHOOL
I REALLY WANT TO GO TO.

06:51.779 --> 06:55.649
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU DON'T WANNA
GO TO SCHOOL IN CHICAGO, ANYWAY.

06:55.649 --> 06:58.852
IT'S A WINDY CITY--
A TERRIBLE COLLEGE FOR HAIR.

07:03.791 --> 07:06.326
OH, I CAN'T DO THIS.
YOU DO IOWA.

07:06.326 --> 07:11.499
OKAY.
(giggles)

07:11.499 --> 07:12.733
YOU KNOW WHAT?

07:12.733 --> 07:15.769
I HAVE A GREAT FEELING
ABOUT COLUMBIA.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.712
SORRY, HONEY.

07:24.712 --> 07:28.215
WELL... WHO WANTS
TO GO TO NEW YORK, ANYWAY?

07:28.215 --> 07:31.852
I MEAN, SHOPPING, AND THEATER
AND NIGHTLIFE...

07:31.852 --> 07:35.055
STUPID CITY NEVER SLEEPS,
AND I NEED MY EIGHT HOURS!

07:35.055 --> 07:37.658
CARMEN...

07:37.658 --> 07:39.292
DON'T BE TOO UPSET.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.762
THERE'S STILL A LETTER COMING
FROM NORTHERN VERMONT STATE.

07:41.762 --> 07:43.964
GO, MAPLE TAPPERS!

07:48.969 --> 07:52.005
ANGIE, I GOT THE GINGER ALE
FOR YOUR STOMACH.

07:52.005 --> 07:53.406
THANKS.

07:53.406 --> 07:55.408
GEORGE,
CARMEN JUST GOT REJECTED

07:55.408 --> 07:57.210
FROM NORTHWESTERN,
IOWA AND COLUMBIA.

07:57.210 --> 07:59.913
HEY, THE HELL WITH THEM!
CARMEN'S STILL GOT VERMONT.

07:59.913 --> 08:01.882
AND IF THAT DON'T WORK OUT,
SHE CAN GO

08:01.882 --> 08:03.717
TO VALLEY COMMUNITY COLLEGE
LIKE HER OLD MAN.

08:03.717 --> 08:05.619
SHE'LL BE A LEGACY.

08:05.619 --> 08:09.857
YOU DROPPED OUT
AFTER TWO WEEKS.

08:09.857 --> 08:12.793
THAT'S TWO MORE WEEKS
OF COLLEGE THAN YOU HAD!

08:14.394 --> 08:17.130
JEALOUSY IS SO UGLY,
SO HIGH SCHOOL.

08:24.838 --> 08:28.108
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

08:28.108 --> 08:30.077
UH, I'M...

08:30.077 --> 08:32.212
BRINGING YOU A BEER...

08:32.212 --> 08:34.548
'CAUSE I LOVE YOU, GRANDMA.

08:34.548 --> 08:37.751
AND I'M GONNA
DRINK THIS BEER,

08:37.751 --> 08:41.288
BECAUSE I LOVE IT.

08:41.288 --> 08:43.056
(knock on door)

08:43.056 --> 08:46.493
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
DON'T GET THAT YET.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

08:46.493 --> 08:47.761
I GOT A SURPRISE FOR YOU.

08:47.761 --> 08:49.697
I RAN INTO ONE
OF YOUR EX-BOYFRIENDS

08:49.697 --> 08:50.998
AT THE CONVENIENCE STORE.

08:50.998 --> 08:53.567
MOM, YOU REMEMBER EDDIE?
EDDIE GARCIA?

08:53.567 --> 08:55.502
EDDIE JOHNSON?

08:55.502 --> 08:57.971
EDDIE CAMACHO?

08:57.971 --> 09:00.974
NO, YOU GUYS HAD
SOMETHING SPECIAL.

09:00.974 --> 09:03.644
OH...

09:03.644 --> 09:06.079
"BIG EDDIE" BERGMAN.

09:07.781 --> 09:10.117
"FAST" EDDIE...
"FREAKY" EDDIE!

09:10.117 --> 09:12.419
MOM!

09:12.419 --> 09:16.323
"SLOW, STEADY, SWEATY" EDDIE!

09:16.323 --> 09:18.926
Ã³RALE, JOAN COLLINS!

09:18.926 --> 09:23.130
YOUR CLASSY LADY'S
WAITING FOR YOU.

09:23.130 --> 09:25.799
EDDIE CARTER.

09:25.799 --> 09:27.500
HELLO, BENITA.

09:27.500 --> 09:29.302
YOU LOOK JUST AS LOVELY

09:29.302 --> 09:32.640
AS THE DAY YOU CHASED ME
OUT OF YOUR HOUSE

09:32.640 --> 09:34.675
WITH A HOT IRON.

09:34.675 --> 09:38.511
I STILL GOT THE TRIANGLE
ON MY ASS.

09:38.511 --> 09:40.814
CONSIDERING
WHERE I WAS AIMING,

09:40.814 --> 09:44.551
YOU WERE LUCKY
YOU TURNED AROUND.

09:44.551 --> 09:46.253
EDDIE, THIS IS
MY WIFE ANGIE.

09:46.253 --> 09:47.587
NICE TO MEET YOU.

09:47.587 --> 09:51.224
I WONDER IF YOU COULD COME
OUTSIDE FOR A MOMENT AND TALK.

09:54.227 --> 09:55.996
(Angie) WHO'S THAT?

09:55.996 --> 09:58.131
THE ONLY GOOD GUY
MY MOM EVER DATED.

09:58.131 --> 10:00.033
WHY'D SHE BREAK UP
WITH HIM?

10:00.033 --> 10:02.736
WHO KNOWS? YOU KNOW,
SOME THINGS JUST HAPPEN.

10:02.736 --> 10:05.605
I MEAN,
WHY DOES THE WIND BLOW?

10:09.643 --> 10:12.846
BECAUSE AIR NATURALLY MOVES
FROM A HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM

10:12.846 --> 10:15.448
TO A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM.
(makes buzzing noise)

10:15.448 --> 10:17.450
WRONG. NICE TRY.

10:17.450 --> 10:22.489
THEN WHERE DOES IT COME FROM?
NOBODY KNOWS.
THAT'S MY POINT.

10:22.489 --> 10:25.859
CHECK IT OUT.
THEY'RE HITTING IT OFF.
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

10:25.859 --> 10:27.494
HEY, REMEMBER WHEN
WE WENT TO THE ZOO,

10:27.494 --> 10:29.763
AND THE RHINOS WERE
ABOUT TO... (whistles)?

10:29.763 --> 10:31.564
IT'S LIKE THAT.

10:31.564 --> 10:34.835
THEY'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WHO'S THE DOMINANT MALE.

10:34.835 --> 10:37.170
WE'RE GONNA GO
FOR A LITTLE DRIVE.

10:37.170 --> 10:39.673
WHY DON'T YOU START DINNER
WITHOUT US?

10:39.673 --> 10:41.441
OKAY, YOU KIDS
HAVE A GOOD TIME.

10:41.441 --> 10:43.110
AND JUST SO YOU KNOW, EDDIE,

10:43.110 --> 10:44.978
HER CURFEW IS
THE FIRST WEEK OF AUGUST.

10:44.978 --> 10:47.848
IF YOU'RE GONNA
KEEP HER OUT PAST THEN,

10:47.848 --> 10:49.282
REALLY, BRO, THANK YOU.

10:53.153 --> 10:55.055
GEORGE, DUDE...

10:55.055 --> 10:57.357
DON'T KEEP THINGS FROM ME,
ALL RIGHT?

10:57.357 --> 11:00.260
I'M YOUR FRIEND.
YOU NEED TO TELL ME THE TRUTH.

11:00.260 --> 11:04.397
OKAY, FINE, I SUBMITTED
YOUR NAME TO "EXTREME MAKEOVER."

11:06.166 --> 11:08.936
THEY MIGHT BE ABLE
TO DO SOMETHING

11:08.936 --> 11:11.939
ABOUT THOSEEARS.
MIGHT.

11:11.939 --> 11:13.741
I'M TALKING ABOUT
MEL AND JACK.

11:13.741 --> 11:16.476
I HEARD THEY WERE GONNA
CLOSE THE FACTORY.

11:16.476 --> 11:18.245
WHAT? WHO TOLD YOU THAT?

11:18.245 --> 11:21.148
WELL, MICHELLE FROM ACCOUNTING
WAS ASKING ME OUT ON A DATE.

11:21.148 --> 11:23.951
AND MEL AND JACK WALKED BY,
AND I HEARD THEM TALKING

11:23.951 --> 11:26.053
THAT THEY WERE GONNA
SELL THE FACTORY.

11:26.053 --> 11:28.789
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.
MICHELLE IS HOT.

11:28.789 --> 11:31.558
MAN, WHY WOULD SHE ASK YOU
OUT ON A DATE?

11:31.558 --> 11:35.996
NOT HOT MICHELLE,
NASTY MICHELLE.

11:35.996 --> 11:38.565
WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH THE FACTORY?

11:38.565 --> 11:40.133
LET ME CALL
MEL AND JACK.

11:40.133 --> 11:44.371
ERNIE, DID YOU GET THAT STUFF
FOR THE BARBECUE WE FORGOT?

11:44.371 --> 11:47.074
OH, NO, THE CONVENIENCE STORE
IS CLOSED, MAN.

11:47.074 --> 11:49.977
IT'S ALL TAPED OFF.
IT JUST GOT ROBBED!
WHEN?

11:49.977 --> 11:52.412
WELL, LIKE AN HOUR AGO.
THE DUDE HELD IT UP AT GUNPOINT.

11:52.412 --> 11:56.316
GET OUT OF HERE!
MAX AND I WERE JUST THERE!

11:56.316 --> 12:00.020
THE COP SAID THE GUY WAS WEARING
JEANS AND A LEATHER JACKET.

12:00.020 --> 12:01.789
GEORGE, YOU DON'T THINK
THAT EDDIE...

12:01.789 --> 12:05.926
NO. NO, NO, NO, NO WAY.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT
THE WEIRD THING IS?

12:05.926 --> 12:08.261
THEY SAY THAT THE CROOK
DIDN'T JUST STEAL THE CASH.

12:08.261 --> 12:12.399
HE TOOK A BOTTLE OF WINE
AND SOME FLOWERS, TOO.

12:14.567 --> 12:18.271
IT'S CIRCUMSTANTIAL! EDDIE'S
THE GREATEST GUY IN THE WORLD!

12:18.271 --> 12:20.207
AND THE WITNESS SAYS
HE SAW THE CROOK

12:20.207 --> 12:22.642
TALKING TO A MEXICAN DUDE
WITH HIS LITTLE GIRL

12:22.642 --> 12:24.511
JUST BEFORE HE ROBBED HIM.

12:28.115 --> 12:32.452
DAMN IT! MAX NEEDS A HAIRCUT.
I TOLD YOU!

12:32.452 --> 12:34.287
HEY, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
GOTTA GO FIND MY MOM!

12:34.287 --> 12:36.323
I JUST SENT HER OUT
WITH AN ARMED ROBBER!

12:36.323 --> 12:39.026
GEORGE, HE COULD
KIDNAP HER OR KILL HER!

12:39.026 --> 12:42.796
DON'T TRY TO TALK ME OUT OF IT!
I STILL GOTTA FIND HER.

12:46.499 --> 12:48.101
HEY.

12:48.101 --> 12:50.737
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

12:50.737 --> 12:54.774
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF I DECIDED
TO GET MARRIED AGAIN?

12:54.774 --> 12:56.576
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?

12:56.576 --> 12:59.779
YOU JUST MET THIS WOMAN ONLINE
A FEW DAYS AGO.

12:59.779 --> 13:01.781
WHAT DO YOU EVEN
KNOW ABOUT HER?

13:01.781 --> 13:06.186
WELL, I KNOW SHE'S A STUNNING
27 YEAR OLD WHO LOVES ME.

13:12.159 --> 13:15.528
27?
THAT'S YOUNGER THAN ME.

13:15.528 --> 13:17.898
I KNOW. HIGH-FIVE!

13:17.898 --> 13:20.800
ANGIE... ANGIE...

13:20.800 --> 13:22.802
IF YOU MET HER,
YOU WOULD LIKE HER.

13:22.802 --> 13:25.038
SHE HAS EXQUISITE TASTE.

13:25.038 --> 13:29.009
YOU SHOULD SEE THE DIAMOND
BRACELET SHE PICKED OUT.

13:29.009 --> 13:32.045
SHE ALREADY HAS YOU BUYING HER
EXPENSIVE JEWELRY?

13:32.045 --> 13:33.947
SHE ONLY
ACCEPTED THE BRACELET

13:33.947 --> 13:36.049
BECAUSE SHE KNEW
IT MADE ME HAPPY.

13:36.049 --> 13:38.886
SAME WITH THE WATCH
AND THE CAR.

13:38.886 --> 13:41.889
OH, IT'S A 2-YEAR LEASE.
COME ON, SAVE ME THE DRAMATICS!

13:41.889 --> 13:43.523
NO, IT'S NOT THAT.

13:43.523 --> 13:47.727
IT'S JUST I'VE HAD
A STOMACHACHE ALL DAY.
REALLY?

13:47.727 --> 13:50.530
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY FEVER.
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN SICK?

13:50.530 --> 13:51.965
WELL, THE PAST FEW MORNINGS,

13:51.965 --> 13:53.867
I'VE JUST FELT
A LITTLE NAUSEOUS.

13:53.867 --> 13:56.169
IT'S PROBABLY
JUST A STOMACH BUG.

13:56.169 --> 13:58.838
OR MAYBE...
YOU'RE PREGNANT!

13:58.838 --> 14:01.141
(laughing) YEAH, RIGHT.

14:05.178 --> 14:08.715
I WENT TO THIRSTY'S,
I CHECKED HER APARTMENT,

14:08.715 --> 14:11.684
I LOOKED IN HER DRAWERS,
I CAN'T FIND MY MOM ANYWHERE.

14:11.684 --> 14:14.121
I HOPE SHE'S OKAY.

14:14.121 --> 14:16.489
HOW COULD YOU HAVE NO CLUE
THIS GUY WAS AN ARMED ROBBER?

14:16.489 --> 14:18.525
I SAW THE GUY IN THE STORE
FOR TWO MINUTES!

14:18.525 --> 14:20.260
WELL, WHAT ABOUT
WHEN YOU WERE A KID?

14:20.260 --> 14:21.929
WERE THERE ANY SIGNS
HE WAS A CRIMINAL?

14:21.929 --> 14:26.033
I MEAN, HE DOVE IN THE BUSHES
WHEN THE COPS DROVE BY.

14:26.033 --> 14:27.500
HE BURIED CASH
IN THE BACKYARD

14:27.500 --> 14:29.970
AND BEAT SOME DUDE WITH A BAT
WHO OWED HIM MONEY.

14:29.970 --> 14:32.205
ANGIE, HE WAS
A REGULAR NEIGHBORHOOD GUY!

14:35.142 --> 14:36.709
MOM, ARE YOU OKAY?

14:36.709 --> 14:38.245
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

14:38.245 --> 14:39.879
EDDIE'S A CRIMINAL.
HE ROBBED THE CONVENIENCE STORE.

14:39.879 --> 14:42.382
OH, I KNOW. WHY THE HELL
DO YOU THINK I GOT RID OF HIM?

14:42.382 --> 14:45.552
YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME, MOM.
I THOUGHT HE KIDNAPPED YOU!

14:45.552 --> 14:49.456
I CALLED THE POLICE!
YOU DID WHAT?
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?

14:49.456 --> 14:51.624
WE WERE WORRIED ABOUT YOU.
HE'S ARMED!
OH, PLEASE!

14:51.624 --> 14:55.362
HE'S SHOT FEWER PEOPLE
THAN THE VICE PRESIDENT!

14:55.362 --> 14:59.166
WHEN DID YOU
CALL THE COPS?

14:59.166 --> 15:00.733
ABOUT 20 MINUTES AGO.
WHY?

15:00.733 --> 15:03.070
OH... I GOTTA
GET OUT OF HERE!

15:03.070 --> 15:04.671
EDDIE IS GONNA THINK
THAT I TURNED HIM IN!

15:04.671 --> 15:07.007
AND WHEN THE COPS BUST HIM,
HE'S GONNA GIVE ME UP!

15:07.007 --> 15:09.342
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, GIVE YOU UP?

15:09.342 --> 15:11.578
MOM, YOU HAVEN'T
DONE ANYTHING WRONG!

15:11.578 --> 15:13.613
WELL...

15:13.613 --> 15:16.549
MOM, WHAT'D YOU DO?
ROB A PLACE? SHOOT SOMEONE?

15:16.549 --> 15:20.453
I KNOW--YOU FLASHED SOMEONE,
AND THEY KILLED THEMSELVES.

15:20.453 --> 15:23.056
NO, GEORGE!

15:23.056 --> 15:25.292
I DROVE A GETAWAY CAR ONCE.

15:25.292 --> 15:27.760
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT
HE WAS ROBBING THE PLACE!

15:27.760 --> 15:30.297
HE JUMPED IN THE CAR,
HE TOLD ME TO PEEL OUT.

15:30.297 --> 15:32.232
I DID, THEN I THREW THE GUN
OUT THE WINDOW,

15:32.232 --> 15:34.234
AND I PAINTED MY CAR WHITE.

15:34.234 --> 15:36.803
YOU DIDN'T
PAINT THE CAR WHITE!

15:36.803 --> 15:39.172
I PAINTED IT WHITE!

15:39.172 --> 15:41.141
YOU TOLD ME YOU WERE
TEACHING ME KARATE!

15:41.141 --> 15:44.144
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU HAVE DONE?

15:44.144 --> 15:46.146
MOM, THAT WAS
A LONG TIME AGO.

15:46.146 --> 15:47.914
THERE'S A STATUTE
OF LIMITATIONS.

15:47.914 --> 15:51.218
GEORGE, IT WAS IN ARIZONA.
I CROSSED STATE LINES.

15:51.218 --> 15:54.154
THEY CAN BUST ME ANYTIME.

15:54.154 --> 15:56.189
GEORGE!
MM-HMM?

15:56.189 --> 15:59.993
THEY DON'T ALLOW CIGARETTES
IN PRISON ANYMORE!

15:59.993 --> 16:03.496
I WILL DIE.

16:12.105 --> 16:13.740
AND EVEN IF YOU
DID GET ARRESTED,

16:13.740 --> 16:15.742
THEY WOULD SEND YOU
TO A WOMEN'S PRISON.

16:15.742 --> 16:18.478
ALL YOU'D HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT
IS THAT BUTCHY WOMAN

16:18.478 --> 16:22.015
WHO RULES THE SHOWER,
AND THAT COULD BE YOU!

16:26.319 --> 16:28.455
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
OUT HERE IN THE DARK?

16:28.455 --> 16:31.024
I JUST GOT MY LETTER
FROM NORTHERN VERMONT.

16:31.024 --> 16:33.860
BUT I'M AFRAID
TO OPEN IT.

16:33.860 --> 16:35.328
THIS IS MY LAST SHOT, MOM.

16:35.328 --> 16:38.231
NOT JUST FOR AN EDUCATION,
FOR FREEDOM.

16:39.932 --> 16:42.902
I CAN'T PARTY AND PIERCE THINGS
IN THIS HOUSE.

16:42.902 --> 16:45.972
I NEED TO GO AWAY.

16:45.972 --> 16:48.641
CARMEN,
IF FOR SOME CRAZY REASON,

16:48.641 --> 16:51.144
THEY ARE STUPID ENOUGH
NOT TO TAKE YOU,

16:51.144 --> 16:53.346
THEN YOUR DAD CAN
PULL SOME STRINGS FOR YOU

16:53.346 --> 16:55.548
AT VALLEY COMMUNITY COLLEGE.

16:55.548 --> 16:56.949
YOU'RE A LEGACY.

16:56.949 --> 17:00.987
MOM, THAT PLACE IS A JOKE,
AND I DIDN'T EVEN APPLY.

17:00.987 --> 17:03.123
IT'S NOT A JOKE,
AND YOU CAN ALWAYS APPLY.

17:03.123 --> 17:05.024
I JUST GOT A COUPON
IN THE MAIL.

17:05.024 --> 17:06.959
IT'LL SAVE YOU $10
ON TUITION,

17:06.959 --> 17:09.896
AND WE CAN
GET OUR CARPETS CLEANED.

17:09.896 --> 17:11.798
COME ON, VERMONT.

17:15.034 --> 17:17.237
I WANNA DO THIS ALONE.

17:19.172 --> 17:20.773
GOOD LUCK, HONEY.

17:25.011 --> 17:28.948
I CAN'T GET AHOLD
OF MY MOM.
UH, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

17:28.948 --> 17:31.050
WAIT, I GOTTA CALL
JACK AND MEL

17:31.050 --> 17:33.853
AND FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH THE FACTORY.
IT'S PRETTY IMPORTANT.

17:33.853 --> 17:35.588
YEAH, MORE IMPORTANT
THAN ME LOSING MY JOB?

17:35.588 --> 17:38.458
YEAH, THIS MAY BE
BIGGER THAN THAT.

17:39.959 --> 17:45.765
REMEMBER LAST MONTH WHEN WE WERE
WATCHING "MR. AND MRS. SMITH,"

17:45.765 --> 17:49.202
AND YOU CHASED ME UPSTAIRS,
CALLED ME "ANGELINA"?

17:54.174 --> 17:56.676
WELL, BRAD...

17:58.778 --> 18:04.351
I MIGHT BE GIVING YOU
WHAT JENNIFER WOULDN'T.

18:07.754 --> 18:09.356
A CAMBODIAN KID?

18:11.758 --> 18:14.227
NO!

18:14.227 --> 18:17.564
I MIGHT BE PREGNANT.

18:17.564 --> 18:23.270
WHAT?! OH, NO, HELL, NO.
HEY, HELL, NO.

18:23.270 --> 18:24.937
YOU BETTER HOPE
THAT BRAD AND ANGELINA

18:24.937 --> 18:26.906
WANTED A LITTLE MEXICAN KID
FOR THEIR COLLECTION,

18:26.906 --> 18:29.176
BECAUSE I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE'RE RAISING ANOTHER ONE!

18:29.176 --> 18:32.111
WELL, I'LL TELL YOU
IN ABOUT FIVE MINUTES.

18:32.111 --> 18:34.281
WHAT ABOUT THE EXTRA ROOM?

18:34.281 --> 18:37.617
THAT WAS GONNA BE
MY HOME THEATER!

18:37.617 --> 18:41.454
YOUR HOME THEATER?
HOW COULD YOU BE SO SELFISH?

18:41.454 --> 18:44.924
WHAT ABOUT WHAT'S
GONNA HAPPEN TO MY BODY?!

18:44.924 --> 18:49.796
OH, MAN, THE HORMONES
ARE ALREADY KICKING IN.

18:51.731 --> 18:54.301
MOM, WHERE YOU BEEN?
I'VE BEEN CALLING YOU!

18:54.301 --> 18:56.169
GEORGE, THE POLICE
ARE AT MY PLACE.

18:56.169 --> 18:58.070
I CAN'T GET INSIDE.
I NEED CASH QUICK.

18:58.070 --> 19:01.341
I GOTTA GET OUT OF TOWN!
MOM. RUNNING AWAY
MAKES YOU LOOK GUILTY.

19:01.341 --> 19:03.876
I ALREADY TOLD YOU.
I AM GUILTY!

19:03.876 --> 19:06.112
NOW GIVE ME 300 BUCKS,
AND I'LL CALL YOU

19:06.112 --> 19:09.015
AFTER I BUY A HOUSE
IN GUATEMALA!

19:09.015 --> 19:11.351
I'M NOT GIVING YOU
ANY MONEY.

19:11.351 --> 19:13.320
GEORGE, I NEED YOUR HELP!

19:13.320 --> 19:15.322
I'M NOT GONNA GET ANYWHERE
WITH 60 BUCKS,

19:15.322 --> 19:17.690
A PACK OF SMOKES
AND EDDIE'S GUN!

19:17.690 --> 19:19.526
WHAT THE HELL?!

19:21.261 --> 19:23.696
WHY DO YOU HAVE THAT?!
I DON'T KNOW.
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

19:23.696 --> 19:26.266
HE ASKED IF HE COULD STAY AT
MY PLACE FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS,

19:26.266 --> 19:29.068
AND THEN I SAID NO,
AND WE HAD THIS HUGE FIGHT.

19:29.068 --> 19:33.005
AND THAT IS WHEN HE MUST HAVE
PUT IT IN MY PURSE!

19:33.005 --> 19:34.307
(knock on door)

19:34.307 --> 19:35.975
(George)
MOM, IT'S THE COPS.

19:35.975 --> 19:37.510
OKAY, ALL RIGHT,
GEORGE, LISTEN.

19:37.510 --> 19:39.779
DON'T LET THEM IN,
BECAUSE IT'S GONNA LOOK LIKE

19:39.779 --> 19:42.215
I'M TRYING
TO GET RID OF THIS GUN!

19:42.215 --> 19:45.252
I GOTTA GET RID OF THIS GUN!
(knock)

19:45.252 --> 19:47.186
HEY, HEY,
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE, MAN!

19:47.186 --> 19:50.290
I GOTTA
PUT SOME CLOTHES ON.

19:50.290 --> 19:52.892
OKAY,
WHAT SHOULD I KNOW, MOM?

19:52.892 --> 19:54.661
WHAT DID YOU DO? STEAL A CAR?
KNOCK OFF A BANK?

19:54.661 --> 19:56.696
MAYBE YOU GOT A BALLOON
FULL OF HEROIN IN YOUR BUTT.

19:56.696 --> 20:01.100
I NEED SOME TIME, GEORGE.
LIE! MAKE UP SOMETHING!

20:01.100 --> 20:02.369
MOM, I'M NOT LYING
TO THE POLICE.

20:02.369 --> 20:04.070
GEORGE, PLEASE, YOU GOTTA--
(knock)

20:04.070 --> 20:08.708
COVER FOR ME, GEORGE, PLEASE!
I'M YOUR MOTHER. I RAISED YOU.

20:08.708 --> 20:12.579
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE NOT
HELPING YOURSELF THERE.

20:15.081 --> 20:18.050
(cell phone rings)

20:18.050 --> 20:22.221
GEORGE, CALL ME. I JUST WENT
THROUGH MEL AND JACK'S DESK.

20:22.221 --> 20:24.491
THEY'RE MOVING THE COMPANY
TO MEXICO!

20:24.491 --> 20:26.626
I CAN'T LOSE MY JOB!
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

20:26.626 --> 20:28.261
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

20:28.261 --> 20:29.762
(gasps)

20:55.054 --> 21:00.427
WELL, LINDSAY, THERE IS
SOMETHING I HAVE TO ASK YOU.

21:18.144 --> 21:21.348
ARE YOU GEORGE LOPEZ?

21:21.348 --> 21:22.982
UH, YES.

21:22.982 --> 21:25.418
WE'RE LOOKING FOR YOUR MOTHER.
DO YOU KNOW WHERE SHE IS?

21:25.418 --> 21:31.290
WHY? DID SOMEBODY ORDER
A STRIPPER-GRAM?

21:31.290 --> 21:33.092
I GET IT--
YOU HOLD A BOOM BOX

21:33.092 --> 21:36.563
WHILE "OFFICER GRIND IT" HERE
GETS DOWN TO A G-STRING.

21:38.331 --> 21:41.334
WE HAVE EDDIE CARTER
IN CUSTODY,

21:41.334 --> 21:44.504
AND WE WANNA TALK
TO YOUR MOTHER. IS SHE HERE?

21:44.504 --> 21:47.507
MR. LOPEZ, IF YOU KNOW WHERE
SHE IS AND YOU DON'T TELL US,

21:47.507 --> 21:49.376
YOU'RE AN ACCOMPLICE.
