WEBVTT

01:20.780 --> 01:21.614
Sarah?

01:44.269 --> 01:46.606
- Did Susan offer you a drink?
- I'm fine.

01:49.709 --> 01:53.046
I suppose you're wondering
why you've been called in.

01:53.078 --> 01:55.848
This must seem all
very strange at first.

01:55.882 --> 01:58.118
Stuffy office.

01:58.150 --> 01:59.619
Old man across the table.

02:01.387 --> 02:05.158
But I assure you, I'm here to
help you through this process.

02:08.394 --> 02:10.128
I have no idea
what this is about.

02:10.163 --> 02:10.997
No idea?

02:11.897 --> 02:12.733
No.

02:13.432 --> 02:14.733
At all?

02:14.766 --> 02:17.137
No.

02:19.472 --> 02:20.907
It's about your mother.

02:22.341 --> 02:24.311
More specifically, her estate.

02:26.079 --> 02:29.748
Her various possessions,
wealth, properties.

02:29.782 --> 02:30.884
Things of that nature.

02:32.318 --> 02:34.287
Okay, well, my
mother had nothing.

02:34.319 --> 02:37.424
Like nothing at all, so this
shouldn't take very long.

02:38.824 --> 02:40.693
- Did she even write a will?
- Yes, she did.

02:41.794 --> 02:44.131
She had far from
nothing, Miss Wilkes.

02:45.997 --> 02:48.100
Long before she was committed,

02:49.201 --> 02:51.805
your mother made preparations
in the event of her death.

02:58.443 --> 03:00.312
- House keys.
- What?

03:00.346 --> 03:01.448
It's yours.

03:02.381 --> 03:04.250
Okay. There must
be some mistake.

03:04.282 --> 03:05.051
No.

03:06.384 --> 03:07.853
We don't make mistakes here.

03:11.324 --> 03:13.093
I'm sorry if this comes across

03:13.126 --> 03:14.394
as something of a shock to you.

03:14.426 --> 03:15.895
I can understand.

03:17.430 --> 03:18.465
Take a moment.

03:20.532 --> 03:22.101
Look through the documents.

03:23.102 --> 03:24.070
It's all yours now.

03:39.418 --> 03:40.787
Would you like some privacy?

03:41.454 --> 03:43.456
No, no, it's...

03:46.959 --> 03:47.993
What do I need to do?

03:51.963 --> 03:53.199
Simply sign these.

03:55.033 --> 03:56.235
One for me, one for you.

04:00.338 --> 04:01.841
How much do I owe?

04:01.873 --> 04:04.409
It's all been handled
in that respect.

04:04.443 --> 04:05.378
You needn't worry.

04:10.383 --> 04:13.319
If there's anything
else we can assist with,

04:13.352 --> 04:15.320
anything within the documents
that's not too clear,

04:15.354 --> 04:18.024
we can bring in an
independent solicitor

04:18.057 --> 04:20.459
to double-check
everything with you.

04:27.033 --> 04:28.134
It's uncanny.

04:29.367 --> 04:31.437
Oh, I know.

04:31.470 --> 04:34.508
Oh, I'm sorry, I,
I didn't mean to.

04:35.641 --> 04:37.210
It's just that you're
her doppelganger.

04:39.612 --> 04:41.414
So, you must have met her.

04:42.214 --> 04:43.615
Mm-hm.

04:43.649 --> 04:44.550
Several times.

04:46.651 --> 04:48.987
Well, everyone says
the same thing.

04:49.021 --> 04:50.490
So I take it as a compliment.

05:06.538 --> 05:09.975
Yeah.

05:10.009 --> 05:11.009
Hi.

05:11.043 --> 05:11.877
Hey!

05:13.478 --> 05:15.048
Yeah,
so that's fine.

05:15.081 --> 05:17.217
Cool, I'll look at them.

05:17.250 --> 05:19.017
Go ahead.

05:19.050 --> 05:19.853
Just...

05:20.586 --> 05:22.322
What?

05:23.956 --> 05:26.860
Are you sure
wanna do this? Go there?

05:26.892 --> 05:29.262
I wanna know why my
mother kept this from me.

05:30.196 --> 05:31.598
Well, as long as you're sure.

05:33.499 --> 05:34.534
I'm sure.

05:37.302 --> 05:38.872
How long will you be?

05:38.904 --> 05:40.306
A few
hours and I'll be back.

05:44.442 --> 05:46.445
Yeah, you could do
with a bit of sun.

05:48.480 --> 05:49.581
See you in a bit.

05:49.615 --> 05:50.449
Tah.

07:32.651 --> 07:34.120
Who's that?

07:34.153 --> 07:36.556
I don't know. Your
guess is as good as mine.

07:38.324 --> 07:41.526
Crazy cat lady.

07:41.560 --> 07:43.663
How'd she know we were coming?

07:43.696 --> 07:45.264
Why don't you ask her?

07:45.297 --> 07:46.366
Oh, I will.

07:48.733 --> 07:51.770
I phoned ahead, you
idiot, so we have food.

07:51.803 --> 07:54.539
There's a number for the
maintenance company, so I

07:54.572 --> 07:57.109
called them to make sure
everything would be ready for us.

07:57.142 --> 07:57.977
Mm!

07:59.278 --> 08:01.081
She's probably happy
for something to do.

08:05.317 --> 08:08.353
Oh.

08:10.822 --> 08:12.090
Welcome!

08:12.124 --> 08:15.228
Oh!

08:15.261 --> 08:16.362
Babe, do you need help?

08:16.394 --> 08:17.729
No, I'm good.

08:17.762 --> 08:19.331
Let me show you round.

08:19.365 --> 08:20.600
That's okay.

08:27.505 --> 08:29.107
How was your flight?

08:29.141 --> 08:31.210
Uh, yeah, it was good.

08:31.242 --> 08:32.778
- Yeah?
- Good, yeah.

08:34.379 --> 08:37.182
This is your first time
coming to the house, isn't it?

08:38.417 --> 08:40.753
Yeah, first time ever, huh?

08:40.784 --> 08:41.687
Yeah.

08:49.528 --> 08:53.432
Can't believe you're
finally here.

08:53.466 --> 08:55.768
Little Sarah is not
so little anymore.

08:58.636 --> 09:00.039
I've heard so much about you.

09:00.739 --> 09:02.042
- Really?
- Yeah.

09:04.777 --> 09:06.546
Did the food arrive?

09:06.578 --> 09:09.714
Yeah, it's all in the
fridge and some wine, too.

09:09.748 --> 09:11.484
Oh, wow.

09:11.517 --> 09:12.785
Amazing.

09:12.817 --> 09:16.088
Okay, so if
you need anything else,

09:16.121 --> 09:17.289
anything at all...

09:17.322 --> 09:18.824
- Yeah.
- I'm just up the road.

09:18.857 --> 09:20.792
Okay? There's another property.

09:20.826 --> 09:23.796
You know this. I don't
need to tell you.

09:23.828 --> 09:24.697
Thank you.

09:24.730 --> 09:26.798
But come and
see me there, okay?

09:26.831 --> 09:27.667
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

09:30.602 --> 09:33.738
It's, it's really good to
meet you finally, Sarah.

09:33.772 --> 09:34.807
You too.

09:36.609 --> 09:37.810
Bye.

09:37.842 --> 09:38.677
Bye.

09:39.677 --> 09:41.681
Thank you!

09:47.753 --> 09:49.655
This is...

09:49.687 --> 09:51.124
Bringing back your
first memories?

09:51.157 --> 09:53.192
No, haven't got any of those.

09:53.225 --> 09:54.759
Total let-down?

09:54.793 --> 09:55.562
Nope.

09:56.828 --> 09:58.230
The house in Spain.

09:58.264 --> 09:59.365
No.

09:59.398 --> 10:00.567
Oh, don't slag it.

10:02.868 --> 10:05.805
Exceeding expectations.

10:05.837 --> 10:06.872
Hm.

10:07.907 --> 10:08.841
Whoa.

10:08.874 --> 10:10.209
What?

10:10.241 --> 10:11.676
What? Is it me?

10:11.710 --> 10:13.546
- Yeah, your arm.
- What?

10:13.578 --> 10:16.915
Oh, my God. That's a face-melting
ancient relic under there.

10:18.216 --> 10:20.418
Fuck! Okay, I'm
gonna grab a shower.

10:20.451 --> 10:21.386
I would.

10:23.956 --> 10:24.791
God.

10:26.357 --> 10:27.759
Fuck! Oh, my God,
I'm fucking feral!

10:27.793 --> 10:29.428
Why didn't you tell me?

10:33.731 --> 10:35.367
Where'd it all go wrong, eh?

10:43.642 --> 10:45.578
I didn't even know
this place existed

10:45.610 --> 10:46.812
until about a week ago.

10:48.647 --> 10:50.884
Well, you learn
something new every day.

10:53.451 --> 10:54.653
No phones.

10:55.888 --> 10:57.757
No phones.

10:57.789 --> 10:59.558
For the first few
days, at least.

10:59.591 --> 11:00.826
Yeah, absolutely.

11:11.803 --> 11:12.771
This is so shit.

11:13.772 --> 11:14.907
It's so shit.

11:16.609 --> 11:17.743
Wine?

11:17.775 --> 11:19.211
Only if it's shit.

11:20.446 --> 11:21.647
Tastes like piss.

11:21.679 --> 11:23.281
That's pretty close.

11:29.654 --> 11:30.490
Voila.

11:36.394 --> 11:37.763
Mm!

11:37.796 --> 11:39.799
That's actually really good.

11:43.302 --> 11:44.803
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

12:08.394 --> 12:09.562
What are you doing?

12:10.995 --> 12:11.831
Nothing.

12:13.065 --> 12:15.001
I almost shit myself.

12:17.702 --> 12:18.837
Nailed it!

12:28.647 --> 12:29.949
Caught you!

12:31.015 --> 12:32.450
There's no signal anyway.

12:32.484 --> 12:34.887
Doesn't count. Veto
on phones, remember?

12:34.919 --> 12:37.856
Okay.

12:40.591 --> 12:41.394
Satisfied?

12:43.361 --> 12:44.029
Mm.

12:44.929 --> 12:45.931
Just about.

12:58.910 --> 13:00.945
Do you mind?

13:00.979 --> 13:01.747
Aw!

13:01.779 --> 13:02.981
Can't I watch?

13:03.014 --> 13:04.317
Not yet.

13:04.350 --> 13:06.052
I'm still trying to remember it.

13:06.884 --> 13:08.987
After a few tries.

13:09.020 --> 13:11.589
Something my mom taught
me when I was little.

13:11.623 --> 13:13.626
I can't remember
shit from yesterday.

13:13.658 --> 13:14.994
Looks painful.

14:10.048 --> 14:11.149
Oh, my God!

14:11.182 --> 14:13.652
I know, right? Check it out!

14:13.684 --> 14:14.586
Where'd you find it?

14:14.620 --> 14:16.655
It was hanging up inside.

14:17.655 --> 14:18.490
What?

14:21.125 --> 14:23.495
- Boyhood fantasies?
- Absolutely.

14:23.528 --> 14:24.364
Let me see.

14:25.197 --> 14:27.066
My liege.

14:27.099 --> 14:28.033
Oh, my God.

14:28.066 --> 14:29.535
Fuck. That's really heavy.

14:30.235 --> 14:31.770
Like, really heavy.

14:31.803 --> 14:35.975
All right, careful, you.

14:36.008 --> 14:36.942
Oh, my god.

14:36.975 --> 14:38.744
Put it away or she might
think you're a maniac.

14:38.777 --> 14:39.979
Stop it!

14:40.011 --> 14:41.546
Put it down.

14:42.914 --> 14:45.216
Hi.

14:45.250 --> 14:46.519
How are you?

14:47.820 --> 14:49.088
Yeah, we're good. We're good.

14:50.022 --> 14:51.956
Excuse the intrusion.

14:51.990 --> 14:53.058
Not at all.

14:56.761 --> 14:57.596
I wonder...

15:00.264 --> 15:02.067
- It's...
- It's what?

15:02.100 --> 15:04.070
Can we speak a
line for a moment?

15:06.871 --> 15:08.072
- Yeah.
- Go away?

15:08.105 --> 15:09.641
Yeah.

15:09.674 --> 15:10.909
No worries. Cool.

15:18.649 --> 15:19.552
What is it?

15:21.019 --> 15:23.889
I need to ask your
help, but it's,

15:23.922 --> 15:26.558
it's not something that
should be taken lightly.

15:28.894 --> 15:31.029
I can't really express
what I mean. I'm sorry.

15:32.697 --> 15:37.702
What I want to say is that I
want your help with the house.

15:39.504 --> 15:43.107
I want you to help me clear
away some of the old things

15:43.140 --> 15:47.612
and of remnants of the past,
and I daren't get rid of them.

15:47.645 --> 15:48.947
My mother's things?

15:48.980 --> 15:49.816
I don't know.

15:51.817 --> 15:53.952
Whatever it is, I'm
sure I can help.

15:55.220 --> 15:57.790
You need to be sure.
I don't want to, um...

15:58.923 --> 16:00.158
It's fine. Really.

16:01.158 --> 16:02.227
Thank you.

16:03.128 --> 16:04.597
I hope that's okay?

16:04.629 --> 16:05.730
That's okay.

16:06.932 --> 16:08.201
Do you promise?

16:10.134 --> 16:11.136
I promise.

16:13.272 --> 16:14.105
Thank you.

16:19.811 --> 16:22.081
Continue as you are, for now.

16:30.889 --> 16:35.894
- What happened there?
- I don't know.

16:38.096 --> 16:40.832
Born in a barn?

16:56.648 --> 16:58.149
No.

16:58.182 --> 17:00.019
What're you looking for?

17:01.219 --> 17:02.855
It's locked.

17:02.888 --> 17:03.722
Again.

17:04.823 --> 17:05.891
I shall repeat.

17:05.923 --> 17:07.759
Another toilet.

17:07.791 --> 17:08.792
Just use this one.

17:10.627 --> 17:13.932
This might be, um, a big...

17:13.964 --> 17:16.769
Oh, just go down
around the right.

17:24.241 --> 17:25.545
Are you okay?

17:27.211 --> 17:29.013
- Jared?
- Yeah.

17:29.047 --> 17:30.214
Are you okay?

17:30.248 --> 17:32.585
Yeah.

17:32.617 --> 17:33.719
Are you sure?

17:35.019 --> 17:39.258
Mm, yeah. Just a bit of
a head-rush, I think.

17:39.290 --> 17:41.826
I felt a bit nauseous.

17:41.859 --> 17:44.228
Do you want some
tablets? I brought some.

17:44.261 --> 17:45.063
Um...

17:47.231 --> 17:48.834
Actually, that might be an idea.

17:48.866 --> 17:49.701
Here.

17:54.306 --> 17:57.875
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yeah, honestly, I'm fine.

17:57.909 --> 17:59.678
Was probably just the flight.

17:59.711 --> 18:01.413
Too much wine.

18:01.445 --> 18:03.147
Get dehydrated.

18:03.181 --> 18:04.683
Well, I'll have to get you
a pair of sexy DVT socks.

18:06.785 --> 18:09.088
Yeah, I'd happily
rock a pair of those.

18:09.121 --> 18:09.989
I'm gonna shower.

18:53.230 --> 18:54.799
Found it!

18:57.499 --> 18:58.104
Okay, I won't be long!

18:59.270 --> 19:00.373
Open the red, por favor.

19:04.041 --> 19:05.343
Muchos gracias!

19:29.768 --> 19:30.402
Feeling better?

19:30.434 --> 19:31.970
Mm.

19:32.002 --> 19:32.837
Definitely.

19:34.740 --> 19:38.344
Hope I didn't get it by
food poisoning.

19:42.180 --> 19:43.015
Hm.

19:50.188 --> 19:51.724
Maverick.

19:51.757 --> 19:52.490
Rule breaker.

19:54.358 --> 19:55.160
Daredevil.

19:57.061 --> 19:58.296
I'm living life on the edge.

20:01.398 --> 20:04.969
There's, uh, probably
bogie in there.

20:05.002 --> 20:06.371
That's the secret ingredient.

20:10.407 --> 20:12.477
If you...

20:12.510 --> 20:14.180
What's happened on
there? What've I missed?

20:16.381 --> 20:17.416
- If you...
- If I?

20:18.583 --> 20:20.384
Give me food poisoning,

20:20.417 --> 20:22.186
I'm gonna throw up
on you in your sleep.

20:24.388 --> 20:29.394
Wait till you're dreaming,
calm, peaceful and serene.

20:30.061 --> 20:31.062
They all mean the same thing.

20:31.096 --> 20:32.297
And then fuck you.

20:32.329 --> 20:33.732
Puke in your open mouth.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.001
Bon appetits.

20:45.210 --> 20:47.113
I thought we said no phones?

20:48.212 --> 20:49.013
Oh, we did.

20:53.084 --> 20:54.385
I thought I turned it off.

20:54.419 --> 20:55.187
Oh, yeah?

20:58.355 --> 21:00.159
You fail me.

21:00.192 --> 21:01.826
I have the high ground.

21:01.859 --> 21:03.862
Oh, what? So you can
chop my legs off?

21:12.136 --> 21:13.371
Hm.

21:13.404 --> 21:15.374
- There's no signal.
- Oh?

21:15.406 --> 21:16.442
Glitch in the matrix?

21:18.242 --> 21:19.610
Who is it?

21:19.644 --> 21:21.780
Uh, a withheld number.

21:27.451 --> 21:29.354
Hello?

21:29.386 --> 21:31.823
Sarah?

21:31.856 --> 21:32.524
Please.

21:33.525 --> 21:34.860
Can you hear me?

21:36.094 --> 21:37.461
Sarah, it's me.

21:37.494 --> 21:38.296
Megan.

21:39.497 --> 21:41.166
Help me, please.

21:41.199 --> 21:42.234
Please, Sarah.

21:43.468 --> 21:45.137
I know you're in
the house, Sarah.

21:45.170 --> 21:45.971
Help me.

21:48.339 --> 21:49.140
Who's that?

21:56.213 --> 21:57.883
What's wrong?

21:57.915 --> 21:58.550
Sarah.

21:59.917 --> 22:01.652
Sarah, talk to me.
Hey, what's up?

22:09.126 --> 22:10.596
Hello?

22:10.628 --> 22:11.462
Sarah?

22:13.163 --> 22:14.031
Please, Sarah.

22:14.065 --> 22:16.000
Oh, don't, turn it off!

22:16.034 --> 22:17.536
- Right, right, it's off.
- Turn it off.

22:17.568 --> 22:20.605
- Off, we're off.
- Turn it off!

22:20.638 --> 22:21.573
What is going on?

22:25.477 --> 22:27.546
Oh, it's my sister.

22:28.579 --> 22:31.583
Well, it sounds
like she's in trouble, so...

22:32.584 --> 22:34.452
She's been dead for five years.

22:35.619 --> 22:37.221
All right, well...

22:37.255 --> 22:38.324
What, dead?

22:40.491 --> 22:43.962
Yeah, like, like
six-feet-under dead.

22:46.530 --> 22:49.533
Okay, are you sure? 'Cause it...

22:49.567 --> 22:52.203
All right. Sorry.

22:52.237 --> 22:53.005
Okay.

22:54.071 --> 22:56.375
Don't, just...

22:56.407 --> 22:57.308
Sorry.

23:03.981 --> 23:04.649
Hello?

23:06.550 --> 23:07.586
Hello?

23:09.186 --> 23:10.421
Is there someone there?

23:14.960 --> 23:15.693
Sarah!

23:17.162 --> 23:17.997
Talk to me.

23:28.205 --> 23:29.540
Oh, my god.

23:29.574 --> 23:31.610
What's happening?

23:33.510 --> 23:34.512
Did you hear it too?

23:34.546 --> 23:36.280
Yeah. Of
course I heard it.

23:36.314 --> 23:38.317
I wanna go home now.

23:38.349 --> 23:40.051
- Right now?
- Yes.

23:40.085 --> 23:41.286
It's the
middle of the night.

23:41.318 --> 23:42.988
I'm aware of that.

23:43.020 --> 23:46.125
- We don't have a car.
- Well, then call a taxi.

23:57.801 --> 23:59.038
There's no signal.

24:36.273 --> 24:37.075
Jared?

25:13.744 --> 25:15.546
- No signal.
- Oh, fuck.

25:19.784 --> 25:22.653
Can we go inside, please?

25:22.686 --> 25:23.488
Yeah.

25:40.270 --> 25:43.107
If you
wanna go, we'll go.

25:43.141 --> 25:44.276
I'm sorry.

25:45.477 --> 25:49.781
No, look, we can go to
see, uh, Anna Sofia.

25:49.814 --> 25:52.183
She can call us a cab.

25:52.217 --> 25:55.353
It's okay, I
don't wanna wake her up.

25:55.385 --> 25:56.221
It's too late.

26:07.865 --> 26:11.702
I didn't even
know you had a sister.

26:18.843 --> 26:23.115
Just hearing her voice
again, and then...

26:26.151 --> 26:26.884
Then this house.

26:26.917 --> 26:28.686
Look, if this house is no good,

26:30.755 --> 26:32.825
then we'll go, all right?

26:33.790 --> 26:34.792
- Okay?
- Okay.

26:36.827 --> 26:39.298
I'm sorry. It just
hits you, you know?

26:42.267 --> 26:43.634
You'll work through it.

26:45.836 --> 26:46.805
You're strong.

26:49.807 --> 26:52.211
You don't really know me.

26:55.712 --> 26:57.715
Well, I know enough.

26:59.951 --> 27:03.721
Come on, give me some credit.

27:06.324 --> 27:07.159
Right.

27:08.192 --> 27:09.728
Let's just take a minute, okay?

27:09.760 --> 27:10.761
- Okay.
- Yeah?

27:10.795 --> 27:12.364
- Yeah.
- Figure things out.

27:14.766 --> 27:17.736
And if you still wanna leave,
then we go and see Anna Sofia

27:17.769 --> 27:19.637
and we are out of here.

27:21.538 --> 27:23.541
- Okay.
- Back to England in no time.

27:25.843 --> 27:26.912
Okay.

27:26.944 --> 27:27.778
Come here.

27:34.618 --> 27:36.788
What're you doing?

27:38.489 --> 27:40.858
I'm doing what any
self-respecting Englishman does

27:40.892 --> 27:42.361
in times of elevated stress.

27:44.261 --> 27:44.929
Making a cuppa.

27:58.442 --> 28:00.778
Shall we take a
wander to her then?

28:00.811 --> 28:02.746
Just to see where
Anna Sofia's hiding.

28:02.779 --> 28:05.750
Yeah, she said it was
back up the driveway,

28:05.782 --> 28:07.552
10 minutes or so?

28:09.621 --> 28:11.623
I'll go on my own, then.

28:11.655 --> 28:13.491
Need some milk anyway.

28:16.560 --> 28:17.828
You don't have to go.

28:19.830 --> 28:22.533
Like, go-go?

28:24.501 --> 28:25.937
- What, home, you mean?
- Yeah.

28:30.907 --> 28:32.977
Still need milk, though.

28:33.010 --> 28:34.413
- We do?
- Yeah.

28:35.712 --> 28:36.914
Bloody covers.

28:41.885 --> 28:43.821
You look hot with a
cold sweat, by the way.

28:43.855 --> 28:45.656
Really?

28:45.690 --> 28:46.991
Mm-hm.

28:47.025 --> 28:47.926
Suits ya.

28:47.959 --> 28:49.527
Have to try it more often.

28:49.559 --> 28:51.829
If you could, that'd be great.

28:55.932 --> 28:58.036
I bet you think
I'm a bit mental.

28:58.970 --> 29:00.005
Uh...

29:01.405 --> 29:02.706
Total fucking drama queen.

29:02.740 --> 29:03.942
Hey!

29:07.511 --> 29:08.346
Fuck me.

29:09.713 --> 29:10.548
Oh, God.

29:12.549 --> 29:13.451
How did it happen?

29:14.618 --> 29:16.887
Well, I make a fist,
or in this case...

29:16.921 --> 29:19.024
Oh, ha-ha-ha. I
mean the phone call.

29:24.328 --> 29:25.563
I don't know.

29:26.730 --> 29:28.400
Still trying to
work that bit out.

29:29.967 --> 29:33.639
Probably just some garbled,
faulty server thingy.

29:35.972 --> 29:38.342
A garbled faulty server thing?

29:39.344 --> 29:40.745
Okay, Mr. Tech Wiz.

29:40.778 --> 29:42.514
I don't fucking know, do I?

29:42.547 --> 29:44.682
You just punched
me in the brains!

29:45.784 --> 29:48.053
Yeah, I was trying
to knock some sense into you

29:48.086 --> 29:48.886
Thanks.

29:55.460 --> 29:56.995
I'm sorry this happened.

29:59.663 --> 30:00.932
It's okay.

30:00.964 --> 30:03.000
At first I thought it was
a mistake coming here,

30:03.034 --> 30:07.306
but now you have to
make the best of it.

30:09.006 --> 30:09.908
Oh, yeah?

30:11.409 --> 30:13.511
Okay, then.

30:13.544 --> 30:16.915
If we must.

30:23.488 --> 30:24.489
You there?

30:28.125 --> 30:29.394
Probably not.

30:36.067 --> 30:36.934
Am I crazy?

30:41.939 --> 30:45.076
Not just yet.

31:00.825 --> 31:01.960
Can't sleep?

31:01.992 --> 31:02.793
No.

31:15.071 --> 31:17.041
Penny for your thoughts?

31:19.009 --> 31:20.878
I just want a fresh start.

31:22.246 --> 31:25.417
You can't change the
past, but you can move on.

31:27.117 --> 31:31.088
My mother, she let her
past drive her insane.

31:31.122 --> 31:32.657
She tried to bury it deep.

31:35.460 --> 31:38.096
But people are curious.

31:40.198 --> 31:42.100
My sister found out
about this place

31:42.133 --> 31:44.169
and she couldn't
resist coming here.

31:47.471 --> 31:49.173
But I don't think
she ever returned.

31:53.109 --> 31:56.747
I'm older now than she ever was,

31:56.780 --> 31:57.749
which is depressing.

32:01.085 --> 32:02.220
Well, on the bright side,

32:03.621 --> 32:05.457
the phone might be possessed.

32:07.791 --> 32:10.461
Yeah, I guess I could make
some money off of that.

32:11.194 --> 32:12.096
YouTube channel.

32:23.140 --> 32:25.944
I came here looking for answers
and I don't want to leave

32:25.977 --> 32:26.912
until I get them.

32:28.945 --> 32:29.780
Hm.

32:32.115 --> 32:34.219
My mother never told
me anything, but,

32:35.318 --> 32:37.221
she said Megan died on a trip.

32:40.223 --> 32:43.194
And I think that place was here.

32:48.199 --> 32:50.634
Maybe Anna Sofia
knows something.

32:50.667 --> 32:51.469
I doubt it.

32:53.837 --> 32:55.706
She seems pretty
nervous around you.

32:56.907 --> 32:59.176
It's 'cause I make
people nervous,

32:59.210 --> 33:00.711
when I look them in the eye.

33:33.210 --> 33:34.813
Two minutes my arse.

33:38.048 --> 33:39.651
Hello, Sarah.

33:39.683 --> 33:42.119
Hi.

33:42.153 --> 33:43.320
Did you not see Jared?

33:44.221 --> 33:45.757
No.

33:45.789 --> 33:46.790
Must've missed him.

33:49.292 --> 33:51.228
He wanted to see if
you had any milk.

33:52.128 --> 33:53.330
I didn't see him.

33:56.032 --> 33:58.769
Megan told me that she tried
to contact you last night.

34:00.171 --> 34:01.840
- Excuse me?
- Megan.

34:02.940 --> 34:04.543
She said that you could help us.

34:05.675 --> 34:08.246
That you would be strong
and could help us.

34:08.277 --> 34:11.849
Did you send me that message
from my sister last night?

34:11.882 --> 34:13.851
Megan is in great pain.

34:16.186 --> 34:18.855
Megan is dead.

34:18.889 --> 34:20.257
It has control over her.

34:22.193 --> 34:22.994
Over me.

34:24.295 --> 34:25.597
Over the house.

34:27.297 --> 34:28.699
What are you talking about?

34:29.967 --> 34:31.068
Your mother, Sarah.

34:31.101 --> 34:33.170
She told me of a great spirit

34:33.204 --> 34:35.840
preying on the
minds of the weak.

34:35.873 --> 34:37.309
Collecting their souls.

34:38.943 --> 34:41.379
Yeah, my mom said
a lot of things.

34:41.411 --> 34:43.413
Her body was fine, but
her mind not so much.

34:43.447 --> 34:45.817
Please listen to me, please.

34:47.050 --> 34:49.621
You must stay here.

34:49.652 --> 34:51.088
There is a darkness
in this place

34:51.121 --> 34:53.324
and I need you to
help me get rid of it.

34:55.826 --> 34:56.893
It'll come for you.

34:58.295 --> 35:00.999
And if you're not prepared,
then it will take you,

35:02.099 --> 35:04.269
as it did your mother
and your sister.

35:06.804 --> 35:08.940
Okay, um...

35:08.972 --> 35:10.375
I'd like you to leave.

35:10.407 --> 35:12.342
Jared will be back at any moment

35:12.376 --> 35:14.846
and we'll decide together
whether we want to stay or not.

35:14.878 --> 35:16.713
- Please.
- I feel really uncomfortable.

35:16.746 --> 35:18.282
Please heed my warning.

35:21.052 --> 35:22.920
It's coming for you, Sarah.

35:22.952 --> 35:23.954
Great.

35:23.987 --> 35:25.422
Can't wait.

35:25.456 --> 35:27.425
- You can go now.
- I can help you.

35:27.458 --> 35:30.228
- I don't need it, thank you.
- Prepare.

35:30.260 --> 35:32.029
Please leave me alone.

35:57.054 --> 35:57.889
Hey.

35:59.155 --> 36:00.391
Did you find it?

36:00.423 --> 36:01.159
No.

36:02.059 --> 36:03.428
No?

36:03.460 --> 36:04.294
Nope.

36:05.829 --> 36:07.297
But it's
just up that road.

36:08.331 --> 36:10.300
It's not just up that road.

36:11.802 --> 36:13.371
How far did you walk?

36:13.403 --> 36:14.438
Far.

36:15.472 --> 36:16.306
Pretty far.

36:17.807 --> 36:20.244
Well, it's okay 'cause
we're staying anyway.

36:20.277 --> 36:21.512
We are?

36:21.545 --> 36:22.713
Mm-hm.

36:22.746 --> 36:23.380
How come?

36:24.949 --> 36:26.818
I think Anna Sofia
wants us out of here.

36:28.452 --> 36:30.021
Why?

36:30.054 --> 36:32.389
I don't know but she knew about
the phone call last night.

36:33.423 --> 36:36.226
I think she's trying to
like spook me into leaving.

36:38.394 --> 36:40.398
Do you think she
wants this place to herself?

36:40.431 --> 36:41.932
Yeah, probably.

36:41.965 --> 36:45.335
But it's my family's,
so she can fuck off.

36:46.436 --> 36:48.405
- Good for you.
- Thank you, yes.

36:48.438 --> 36:50.141
Maverick.

36:50.173 --> 36:52.744
But be nice to her 'cause I
don't wanna stir anything up.

36:52.777 --> 36:54.278
Yeah, take
the high ground.

36:54.311 --> 36:56.381
Right, so I can
chop your legs off.

36:58.114 --> 36:59.450
So, what now, Frodo?

37:01.385 --> 37:02.921
- Bam bam bam!
- Oh!

37:05.456 --> 37:07.358
Where we going?

37:07.391 --> 37:08.826
This way.

37:08.858 --> 37:10.193
I've already told you, I'm
not going in that pool.

37:10.226 --> 37:12.230
- Why not?
- Please.

37:15.900 --> 37:16.867
Fuck.

37:17.867 --> 37:18.536
Okay.

37:22.239 --> 37:24.407
- You ready?
- Yeah, I'm always ready.

37:28.978 --> 37:30.147
It's a key!

37:30.181 --> 37:31.315
It is a key.

37:31.347 --> 37:32.884
- What's it for?
- Well done.

37:32.916 --> 37:33.751
Well...

37:37.086 --> 37:38.422
Well what? What's it do?

37:38.454 --> 37:39.456
It opens locks.

37:39.489 --> 37:41.324
Fuck me.

37:41.358 --> 37:43.126
What locks does it open?

37:43.159 --> 37:45.763
It opens the one
inside and the door.

37:46.864 --> 37:47.831
Ah!

37:47.864 --> 37:49.199
Yeah.

37:49.233 --> 37:50.802
Oh, I need a shower.

37:50.835 --> 37:52.470
- Can I do that first?
- Well...

37:52.503 --> 37:54.572
No, no, this is good,
but I just, sweat.

37:54.605 --> 37:56.139
Okay, fine.

37:56.172 --> 37:57.007
Okay, good.

37:58.074 --> 38:00.277
- Like right now, though?
- Yes, right now!

38:01.177 --> 38:02.212
- Okay.
- Thank you!

38:09.219 --> 38:10.954
Open Sesame.

38:10.987 --> 38:13.257
Where is my treasure?

39:35.539 --> 39:36.341
Fuck!

39:39.108 --> 39:39.943
Fuck!

39:42.313 --> 39:43.648
Fuck! Are you fucking with me?

39:43.681 --> 39:45.449
No, I'm not.

39:45.481 --> 39:46.617
Fuck.

39:47.518 --> 39:49.619
Literally you.

39:49.652 --> 39:50.487
But it's not you.

39:53.123 --> 39:54.559
Megan looks more like her dad.

39:56.626 --> 39:57.427
Hey.

39:59.228 --> 40:00.463
Oh.

40:00.496 --> 40:02.165
Here's one for you.

40:07.570 --> 40:09.940
I feel like if we play with
these, they'll fall apart.

40:09.974 --> 40:12.309
Mm, yeah. A bit like my balls.

40:12.342 --> 40:14.411
Exactly like your balls.

40:14.445 --> 40:15.580
I love these things.

40:16.547 --> 40:17.581
Oh!

40:19.182 --> 40:20.117
Yay!

40:20.150 --> 40:21.485
There you go.

40:21.518 --> 40:22.920
That's cool, though.

40:28.625 --> 40:30.695
- Wash much?
- I can't get it off.

40:34.264 --> 40:35.399
You all right?

40:35.431 --> 40:37.300
Yeah, it's just, I
don't know. A bit stiff.

40:37.333 --> 40:41.038
It started hurting earlier
and my head hurts, too.

40:41.070 --> 40:43.074
Mm, it's too much wine.

40:44.775 --> 40:45.576
Probably.

40:47.777 --> 40:49.112
Maybe not enough.

40:56.152 --> 40:56.954
Fuck.

40:58.554 --> 40:59.723
That is mad.

41:09.233 --> 41:10.301
You all right?

41:12.702 --> 41:13.503
Yeah.

41:14.737 --> 41:15.538
I'm fine.

41:15.572 --> 41:16.474
Are you sure?

41:36.159 --> 41:36.994
Hello?

41:40.130 --> 41:41.766
Wait. What're you doing?

41:41.798 --> 41:43.768
I'm gonna go see who it is.

41:52.876 --> 41:54.045
What, what're you doing?

41:54.077 --> 41:55.746
I'm locking the doors.

42:07.291 --> 42:08.126
Fuck me!

42:17.733 --> 42:18.536
Hello?

42:20.503 --> 42:21.338
Who's there?

42:23.773 --> 42:25.675
Anna Sofia, I know
you're hiding!

42:28.478 --> 42:30.246
Anna Sofia, this isn't funny!

42:30.280 --> 42:32.250
Anna Sofia, I know it's you.

42:34.818 --> 42:36.653
Anna Sofia, I know
you're hiding!

42:40.324 --> 42:41.159
Fuck!

42:46.329 --> 42:47.164
Nothing.

42:52.135 --> 42:56.106
Oh, my gosh. She's
probably just hiding.

42:56.139 --> 42:57.407
Why is she doing this?

42:57.440 --> 42:59.810
I don't know, she's
a fucking lunatic!

43:01.844 --> 43:02.679
God.

43:08.385 --> 43:09.220
I'm tired.

43:14.925 --> 43:16.193
Well, should we call
the police or what?

43:16.226 --> 43:17.461
And say what?

43:17.494 --> 43:18.896
Someone's banging on the doors?

43:22.365 --> 43:23.568
It's probably nothing.

43:26.302 --> 43:27.771
Just come to bed.

44:21.958 --> 44:22.792
Megan?

44:24.860 --> 44:27.463
You need to leave this house.

44:27.496 --> 44:32.368
It knows
you're here now.

44:32.402 --> 44:34.572
You can't help me anymore.

44:35.639 --> 44:36.841
No, it has me.

44:42.980 --> 44:44.548
Look away, Sarah.

44:45.815 --> 44:46.616
Look away!

44:50.954 --> 44:53.958
This is all just
to distract you.

44:58.728 --> 44:59.563
Let me go.

45:00.864 --> 45:01.632
Let me go!

45:10.673 --> 45:12.210
Oh, my God. Jared?

45:15.512 --> 45:16.780
Jared?

45:19.483 --> 45:20.951
- What happened?
- What's going on?

45:20.983 --> 45:22.652
Did you trip?

45:22.686 --> 45:23.721
Did you fall?

45:23.753 --> 45:25.288
Oh, my God.

45:25.322 --> 45:27.724
- You're hurt.
- Oh, God.

45:27.757 --> 45:32.762
I felt something, um,
lift me up and grab my...

45:33.362 --> 45:34.797
Grab my head.

45:47.543 --> 45:49.379
Oh.

45:49.413 --> 45:51.048
We need to disinfect that.

45:51.081 --> 45:53.851
I've got some first
aid stuff in my purse.

46:01.757 --> 46:03.960
It's okay, I just
want you to tell me

46:03.994 --> 46:06.364
if there's anything
I'm doing wrong.

46:07.530 --> 46:08.465
You should know by
now what this means.

46:08.498 --> 46:09.932
I'm no expert.

46:09.965 --> 46:11.402
Well, you can help me film it,

46:11.434 --> 46:13.003
and then we can
both watch it back.

46:13.036 --> 46:14.605
Okay, good idea.

46:21.143 --> 46:22.545
Ready?

46:22.579 --> 46:24.048
Yeah, ready.

46:24.081 --> 46:25.481
Go.

46:30.519 --> 46:31.889
Shit!

46:31.922 --> 46:34.057
No, no. Go away, go away.

46:38.961 --> 46:40.463
Jared?

46:40.496 --> 46:41.699
Jared, baby.

46:49.672 --> 46:50.507
Jared!

46:51.807 --> 46:52.943
Jared, baby.

46:54.043 --> 46:57.413
Oh, my God.

46:57.447 --> 46:58.882
Jared, please.

46:58.914 --> 46:59.717
Jared.

47:00.916 --> 47:02.052
Baby.

47:07.056 --> 47:08.091
Oh, shit.

47:15.632 --> 47:17.000
Fuck.

47:25.108 --> 47:25.943
Jared?

47:27.010 --> 47:28.045
Jared.

47:35.184 --> 47:36.019
Jared?

48:08.818 --> 48:10.954
You can
handle this, Sarah.

48:10.987 --> 48:11.789
Only you.

48:16.126 --> 48:17.995
This must be done.

48:22.164 --> 48:23.000
Help me.

48:27.503 --> 48:28.971
I am.

48:29.005 --> 48:30.207
Please, trust me.

48:59.835 --> 49:01.137
Jared?

49:01.170 --> 49:02.839
What're you doing?

49:25.327 --> 49:26.931
What's happening?

49:38.675 --> 49:40.211
What're you doing?

49:48.818 --> 49:49.653
Jared?

51:12.302 --> 51:16.640
My mother, she unleashed
something in this house.

51:18.041 --> 51:19.243
What?

51:20.076 --> 51:21.211
Something that wants me.

51:23.012 --> 51:24.914
Something that wants you too.

51:27.951 --> 51:29.786
You don't really
believe that, do you?

51:29.818 --> 51:31.221
I have reason to.

51:32.956 --> 51:34.257
I sent them my video.

51:34.289 --> 51:36.058
What did they say?

51:36.092 --> 51:36.994
It got rejected.

51:39.094 --> 51:40.230
They called me an amateur.

51:42.731 --> 51:44.835
18 years of training.

51:46.369 --> 51:49.239
- Just an amateur.
- Well, that's not true.

51:49.271 --> 51:51.208
You know that's not true.

51:51.240 --> 51:52.342
We'll film it again.

51:52.375 --> 51:53.376
Too late.

51:54.878 --> 51:57.715
Okay, there'll be other
opportunities. Yeah?

51:59.416 --> 52:00.985
There's a voice inside now.

52:02.284 --> 52:03.686
Making me strong.

52:06.289 --> 52:09.860
It can give me what I want.

52:09.893 --> 52:10.961
It whispers to me.

52:13.063 --> 52:15.231
I thought I'd come here, train,

52:16.365 --> 52:17.166
focus,

52:18.168 --> 52:19.003
achieve,

52:19.902 --> 52:20.737
recharge.

52:22.739 --> 52:24.307
You've done all those things.

52:25.708 --> 52:27.010
Megan, look, please.

52:28.344 --> 52:29.313
Put down the knife.

52:31.313 --> 52:32.449
Here, let me help you.

52:43.259 --> 52:44.327
Megan?

52:44.360 --> 52:45.396
Put the knife down!

52:54.304 --> 52:55.673
Help me, Sarah.

52:58.407 --> 52:59.375
Mother was right.

53:01.376 --> 53:03.279
I'm not strong enough.

53:04.347 --> 53:05.416
It preys on the weak.

53:07.117 --> 53:08.719
Not even Mother could defeat it.

53:10.119 --> 53:13.956
She kept us away from this
place for a very good reason.

53:16.793 --> 53:18.394
But curiosity has
brought you back.

53:21.364 --> 53:23.800
Kill her, Megan.

53:25.768 --> 53:26.869
Do it for me.

53:32.375 --> 53:37.380
You can have everything
you ever wanted.

53:40.215 --> 53:42.251
It can give
me what I want.

53:44.086 --> 53:45.422
What do you want?

53:46.188 --> 53:50.126
But first, I must
give it what it wants.

53:55.164 --> 53:56.298
Megan.

53:56.331 --> 53:57.333
Please.

53:59.135 --> 54:01.371
Your wrist, you're bleeding.

54:02.871 --> 54:04.240
Come here, my love.

54:04.273 --> 54:05.407
Put the knife down.

54:27.463 --> 54:28.499
No.

54:36.072 --> 54:37.440
No!

54:40.043 --> 54:40.878
Why?

54:42.045 --> 54:44.081
I had no choice, Sarah.

54:47.083 --> 54:49.418
If I had left the
house, this thing

54:49.452 --> 54:51.789
would be unleashed
into the world.

54:56.559 --> 54:58.562
I can't change the past.

54:59.528 --> 55:00.563
Sorry.

55:03.166 --> 55:04.034
What do I do?

55:05.134 --> 55:06.503
How do I stop it?

55:07.402 --> 55:09.205
Only one person knew that.

55:10.639 --> 55:11.541
Please, Sarah.

55:13.208 --> 55:15.144
Get away from here
before it takes you.

55:16.512 --> 55:18.114
Has it taken Jared?

55:18.146 --> 55:20.150
Has it taken him?
I need to help him.

55:21.351 --> 55:23.019
Megan!

55:23.052 --> 55:24.588
Megan, please help me!

55:40.036 --> 55:40.871
Jared?

55:45.074 --> 55:45.909
Jared?

55:54.384 --> 55:55.552
Jared, I'm gonna get help.

56:04.559 --> 56:05.929
I'm gonna come back for you.

56:06.728 --> 56:07.563
I promise.

56:09.599 --> 56:11.001
You can get through this.

57:16.298 --> 57:18.001
What're you doing?

57:18.034 --> 57:20.236
Checking the doors are locked.

57:26.376 --> 57:27.210
Hello?

57:30.112 --> 57:32.414
Who's there?

57:32.447 --> 57:33.449
Who's there?

57:36.619 --> 57:38.321
Anna Sofia, I know it's you.

57:42.592 --> 57:43.393
Fuck!

58:01.610 --> 58:02.511
Oh, baby.

58:04.112 --> 58:05.281
What's she done to you?

58:07.817 --> 58:09.719
Does she really give
you what you want?

58:15.625 --> 58:19.094
Jared.

58:32.307 --> 58:33.143
Jared?

58:33.876 --> 58:35.078
We can help you.

58:36.112 --> 58:37.814
We can help each other, okay?

58:39.315 --> 58:43.653
I just need more souls
and then I'll be free.

58:46.222 --> 58:48.858
- Who are you?
- You know who I am.

58:52.795 --> 58:55.798
- I know that voice.
- Yes, you do.

58:58.835 --> 59:00.135
Now.

59:00.168 --> 59:02.304
Sarah means nothing, okay?

59:04.773 --> 59:05.741
This is strong.

59:07.510 --> 59:10.647
So I need someone from the realm
of the living to assist me.

59:11.481 --> 59:15.618
I can only stay here for
mere moments at a time.

59:15.650 --> 59:18.187
Until I have those souls, eh?

59:20.523 --> 59:22.192
Ask yourself, Jared.

59:23.759 --> 59:26.663
What do you really want?

59:26.695 --> 59:28.498
You can have anything.

59:32.735 --> 59:34.403
You could have me.

59:37.273 --> 59:39.709
Do you know that
Sarah's a witch?

59:39.742 --> 59:41.411
Her mother, too.

59:41.443 --> 59:43.712
Witches must be dealt with.

59:43.746 --> 59:45.280
They're evil.

59:45.313 --> 59:46.148
They lie.

59:47.817 --> 59:50.686
She's been lying to you.

59:51.820 --> 59:53.289
Just to get you here.

59:54.789 --> 59:55.592
Why here?

59:58.760 --> 59:59.563
She lied?

01:00:01.164 --> 01:00:03.467
Did she tell you
about this place?

01:00:06.969 --> 01:00:08.538
No, no.

01:00:08.570 --> 01:00:10.574
No, no. She didn't
know about this place.

01:00:11.541 --> 01:00:12.375
She knew.

01:00:14.777 --> 01:00:17.280
And now, look.
She's hurting you.

01:00:19.581 --> 01:00:20.516
Let go, let go.

01:00:20.550 --> 01:00:22.752
We must be rid of Sarah.

01:00:26.188 --> 01:00:27.156
Yeah.

01:00:27.190 --> 01:00:28.724
- Yeah?
- Yes.

01:00:35.864 --> 01:00:37.433
Jared.

01:00:38.833 --> 01:00:39.768
You must kill.

01:01:48.704 --> 01:01:50.807
This is what's to come.

01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:51.841
Jared!

01:01:52.708 --> 01:01:53.510
Jared!

01:01:57.545 --> 01:01:58.347
Jared?

01:02:01.884 --> 01:02:05.922
Jared, come out. I need
to tell you something.

01:02:07.922 --> 01:02:10.025
What's happening to me?

01:02:11.927 --> 01:02:13.930
Something evil is
fucking with us.

01:02:15.831 --> 01:02:17.666
Don't come any closer.

01:02:23.539 --> 01:02:25.307
- You did this!
- Jared, please.

01:02:25.340 --> 01:02:27.676
I'm sorry.

01:02:27.710 --> 01:02:29.478
You did this!

01:02:29.512 --> 01:02:30.813
Please, Jared.

01:02:30.846 --> 01:02:31.880
I'm sorry.

01:02:33.648 --> 01:02:35.652
- How did this happen?
- I don't know!

01:02:35.684 --> 01:02:37.586
We have to figure it out.

01:02:37.619 --> 01:02:39.454
Now, Jared!

01:02:39.487 --> 01:02:40.922
No!

01:02:43.693 --> 01:02:44.527
Jared, no!

01:03:08.016 --> 01:03:09.985
It grows stronger now.

01:03:10.018 --> 01:03:12.021
Do not underestimate it.

01:03:14.889 --> 01:03:17.659
Who are you?

01:03:17.693 --> 01:03:19.696
It's me, Sarah.

01:03:22.898 --> 01:03:23.700
Mom?

01:03:24.699 --> 01:03:26.635
In this place, time distorts.

01:03:27.802 --> 01:03:30.038
When you returned
here, it sensed you

01:03:30.072 --> 01:03:30.940
and began its trickery.

01:03:30.972 --> 01:03:33.043
I had to show you this.

01:03:34.110 --> 01:03:36.479
Give you a chance, at least.

01:03:36.512 --> 01:03:37.947
What do I do?

01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:39.382
You cannot escape it.

01:03:40.849 --> 01:03:44.920
I ran and ran and ran, but it
caught up with me eventually.

01:03:46.155 --> 01:03:47.923
Everything I learned,
I wrote down.

01:03:49.925 --> 01:03:50.727
It will help you.

01:03:52.094 --> 01:03:52.929
Okay.

01:03:54.563 --> 01:03:57.567
If I linger here, the
great shadow will find me.

01:03:57.599 --> 01:04:00.135
Why did, why did you do this?

01:04:00.168 --> 01:04:03.638
I mistakenly thought it would
give me everything I wanted

01:04:03.672 --> 01:04:06.409
for myself and my children.

01:04:06.442 --> 01:04:09.079
When I saw Megan's
ambition, I sent her here.

01:04:10.746 --> 01:04:11.581
But...

01:04:13.081 --> 01:04:16.719
The shadow played tricks
on me, as it has others.

01:04:17.585 --> 01:04:18.788
It destroyed everything.

01:04:20.588 --> 01:04:21.657
What can I do?

01:04:22.891 --> 01:04:23.826
Prepare yourself.

01:04:52.887 --> 01:04:55.490
What's happening to me?

01:04:55.523 --> 01:04:56.992
Something's fucking with us.

01:04:57.025 --> 01:04:58.027
Something evil.

01:05:00.094 --> 01:05:01.463
Don't come any closer.

01:05:01.496 --> 01:05:02.864
You did this.

01:05:02.898 --> 01:05:04.600
Jared, please.

01:05:04.632 --> 01:05:06.535
Let's talk about this, okay?

01:05:08.103 --> 01:05:09.172
Let's talk about this.

01:05:09.204 --> 01:05:11.039
You did this!

01:05:11.072 --> 01:05:12.240
- I'm sorry.
- How did this happen?

01:05:12.273 --> 01:05:14.543
I don't know. We need
to figure it out.

01:05:14.577 --> 01:05:16.078
Now, Jared!

01:05:23.853 --> 01:05:24.854
- No!
- What?

01:05:32.161 --> 01:05:33.762
Where is it?

01:05:33.795 --> 01:05:35.263
What?

01:05:36.898 --> 01:05:38.134
The witch!

01:05:40.068 --> 01:05:42.871
It's not supposed
to be like this!

01:07:10.358 --> 01:07:11.994
You're not going anywhere.

01:07:12.027 --> 01:07:15.197
You're not going
anywhere, witch.

01:07:16.264 --> 01:07:18.000
You're nothing, Sarah.

01:07:18.032 --> 01:07:19.768
Give up. Witch.

01:07:19.802 --> 01:07:23.105
You're not going
anywhere. Witch.

01:07:23.137 --> 01:07:25.173
- Try to stop!
- Shut up!

01:07:25.206 --> 01:07:26.875
Give up, witch.

01:07:28.710 --> 01:07:30.111
What can you do?

01:07:31.746 --> 01:07:32.914
You're nothing, Sarah.

01:07:32.947 --> 01:07:34.783
You're not going anywhere.

01:07:34.817 --> 01:07:36.184
Witch.

01:07:36.217 --> 01:07:37.819
Witch.

01:07:43.659 --> 01:07:45.193
Sarah, burn it, Sarah!

01:07:45.226 --> 01:07:46.127
Shut up!

01:07:46.161 --> 01:07:47.262
You're not going anywhere.

01:07:47.295 --> 01:07:49.130
You're nothing. Give up.

01:07:49.164 --> 01:07:51.267
Give up. Witch.

01:07:51.300 --> 01:07:53.302
Witch.

01:07:53.335 --> 01:07:54.936
Give up!

01:07:54.969 --> 01:07:58.974
Witch.

01:08:00.643 --> 01:08:03.980
Kill the witch!

01:08:12.253 --> 01:08:13.056
No!

01:08:56.863 --> 01:08:59.234
Fucking kill her!

01:09:02.770 --> 01:09:05.240
Get out of my head!

01:09:05.274 --> 01:09:06.843
Get out of my head!

01:09:38.372 --> 01:09:41.843
You cannot
live with it, Sarah.

01:09:45.447 --> 01:09:46.849
Liar!

01:12:05.453 --> 01:12:06.488
Jared?

01:12:08.590 --> 01:12:09.592
Sarah.

01:12:12.060 --> 01:12:12.962
Are you you?

01:12:18.199 --> 01:12:20.402
Last time I checked.

01:12:24.972 --> 01:12:26.542
What am I doing on the floor?

01:12:28.542 --> 01:12:29.578
Are you okay?

01:12:30.945 --> 01:12:31.613
Yeah.

01:12:32.514 --> 01:12:34.115
Yeah, I think so.

01:12:38.987 --> 01:12:40.556
Can you untie me please?

01:12:42.157 --> 01:12:42.992
Yeah.
