Phaser banks
standing by, sir.

00:50.130 --> 00:51.563
Range,
43,000 and closing.

00:51.631 --> 00:54.065
What do you read,
Mr. Spock?

00:54.134 --> 00:56.329
Configuration,
unidentified.

00:56.403 --> 00:58.564
Ion propulsion,
high velocity,

00:58.638 --> 01:00.071
though of
a unique technology.

01:00.140 --> 01:01.505
Any contact,
Lieutenant?

01:01.575 --> 01:03.008
Hailing on
all frequencies.

01:03.076 --> 01:04.509
All languages
have been attempted.

01:04.578 --> 01:05.545
No response.

01:05.612 --> 01:08.012
Now using standard
interstellar symbols.

01:08.081 --> 01:09.013
Keep trying.

01:09.082 --> 01:10.014
Aye, sir.

01:10.083 --> 01:11.516
Magnification 10,
Mr. Chekov.

01:11.585 --> 01:13.109
Aye, sir.

01:14.588 --> 01:17.022
38,000 and closing.

01:17.090 --> 01:18.284
Well, Scotty?

01:18.358 --> 01:21.020
It beats me.
But isn't she a beauty?

01:21.094 --> 01:22.026
Interesting design.

01:22.095 --> 01:24.529
I've never seen
anything like her.

01:24.598 --> 01:26.031
And ion propulsion
at that.

01:26.099 --> 01:28.533
They could teach us
a thing or two.

01:28.602 --> 01:30.035
Life forms,
Mr. Spock?

01:30.103 --> 01:31.536
One.

01:31.605 --> 01:33.038
Humanoid or similar.

01:33.106 --> 01:34.539
Low level of activity.

01:34.608 --> 01:36.542
Life-support systems
functioning.

01:36.610 --> 01:38.043
Interior atmosphere.

01:38.111 --> 01:40.045
Conventional
nitrogen oxygen.

01:40.113 --> 01:41.546
[Beep Beep Beep]

01:43.116 --> 01:44.549
Instruments indicate
a transferral beam

01:44.618 --> 01:47.553
emanating from the area
of the humanoid life form.

01:47.621 --> 01:49.054
Directed at what?

01:49.122 --> 01:50.453
The Enterprise bridge,
Captain.

01:50.524 --> 01:51.456
Security guard.

01:51.525 --> 01:53.550
Security guard
to the bridge.

02:10.276 --> 02:12.006
I'm Captain James Kirk.

02:12.078 --> 02:15.241
This is the star ship
Enterprise.

03:13.907 --> 03:16.637
Space --
the final frontier.

03:22.582 --> 03:27.019
These are the voyages
of the star ship Enterprise.

03:27.087 --> 03:28.520
Its five-year mission --

03:28.588 --> 03:31.022
to explore
strange new worlds ...

03:31.091 --> 03:33.992
to seek out new life
and new civilizations ...

03:35.262 --> 03:38.561
to boldly go where
no man has gone before.

04:37.557 --> 04:38.683
What happened?

04:38.758 --> 04:40.817
Helm status, Mr. Sulu.

04:40.894 --> 04:42.361
No change from
last reading, sir.

04:42.429 --> 04:44.158
Condition reports
from all decks, Lieutenant.

04:44.230 --> 04:45.925
Aye, sir.

04:45.999 --> 04:47.557
Spock. Where's Spock?

04:47.634 --> 04:49.568
Jim! Jim!

04:49.636 --> 04:50.898
Yes, what is it?

04:50.971 --> 04:53.337
Better come down to sickbay
right now.

04:53.406 --> 04:55.340
All right.
On my way.

04:55.408 --> 04:57.842
Deck Five,
personnel, no damage.

05:02.849 --> 05:03.781
Now.

05:05.852 --> 05:06.784
Functioning.

05:12.559 --> 05:14.618
Thank God.

05:17.864 --> 05:19.297
Spock.
What happened?

05:19.366 --> 05:20.799
I found him.

05:20.867 --> 05:21.799
Like this?

05:21.868 --> 05:23.301
No, not like this.

05:23.370 --> 05:24.962
What happened?

05:25.038 --> 05:27.871
I don't know.

05:29.242 --> 05:32.405
You've got him
on complete life support.

05:32.479 --> 05:33.639
Was he dead?

05:33.713 --> 05:36.238
He was worse than dead.

05:36.316 --> 05:38.250
What do you mean?

05:38.318 --> 05:39.842
Jim --

05:39.919 --> 05:41.181
Bones,
what's the mystery?

05:42.889 --> 05:44.379
His brain is gone.

05:47.160 --> 05:50.129
It's been removed
surgically.

05:55.902 --> 05:57.767
How could he survive?

05:57.837 --> 06:00.829
It's the greatest
technical job I've ever seen.

06:00.907 --> 06:02.772
Every nerve ending
in the brain

06:02.842 --> 06:04.139
must've been
neatly sealed.

06:04.210 --> 06:05.768
Nothing ripped,
nothing torn,

06:05.845 --> 06:07.039
no bleeding.

06:07.113 --> 06:08.774
It's a medical miracle.

06:08.848 --> 06:11.783
If his brain
is missing ...

06:11.851 --> 06:13.284
then Spock is dying.

06:13.353 --> 06:14.786
No.

06:14.854 --> 06:16.788
That incredible
Vulcan physique

06:16.856 --> 06:20.292
hung on until
the life-support cycle took over.

06:20.360 --> 06:21.987
His body lives,

06:22.062 --> 06:24.553
the autonomic functions
continue ...

06:26.366 --> 06:28.926
but there is no mind.

06:37.377 --> 06:39.311
That girl.

06:39.379 --> 06:40.539
Aye.

06:40.613 --> 06:41.705
What girl?

06:41.781 --> 06:44.306
From that ship.

06:44.384 --> 06:46.318
She took it.

06:46.386 --> 06:48.320
I don't know why ...

06:48.388 --> 06:50.322
or where ...

06:50.390 --> 06:52.324
but she must've
taken it.

06:53.893 --> 06:56.657
Bones, how long can you
keep him functioning?

06:56.730 --> 06:58.664
I can't give you
any guarantee.

06:58.732 --> 06:59.824
That's not good enough.

06:59.899 --> 07:02.868
If it happened to us,
I'd say indefinitely.

07:02.936 --> 07:05.769
But Vulcan physiology
limits what I can do.

07:05.839 --> 07:09.275
Spock's body is more dependent
on that tremendous brain

07:09.342 --> 07:10.866
for life support.

07:10.944 --> 07:13.378
Then we'll
take him with us.

07:13.446 --> 07:16.609
Take him where?

07:16.683 --> 07:19.709
In search of his brain,
Doctor.

07:21.654 --> 07:23.281
The moment we find it,

07:23.356 --> 07:27.292
we'll restore it to his body,
or we lose him.

07:27.360 --> 07:30.796
Jim, where are you
going to look

07:30.864 --> 07:33.799
in this
whole galaxy?

07:33.867 --> 07:37.303
Where are you going to look
for Spock's brain?

07:37.370 --> 07:40.806
How are you
going to find it?

07:40.874 --> 07:42.307
I'll find it.

07:42.375 --> 07:45.310
Even if you do,
I can't restore it.

07:45.378 --> 07:48.313
I don't have
the medical technique.

07:48.381 --> 07:49.814
It was taken out.

07:49.883 --> 07:52.317
It can be put back in.

07:52.385 --> 07:54.819
But I don't know how.

07:54.888 --> 07:57.823
The thief that took it
has the knowledge.

07:57.891 --> 07:59.825
I'll force it
out of her.

07:59.893 --> 08:01.758
If you don't find it
in 24 hours,

08:01.828 --> 08:04.763
you better forget
the whole thing, Jim.

08:08.835 --> 08:11.269
You and Scotty ...

08:11.337 --> 08:13.271
have Spock ready.

08:20.847 --> 08:23.441
I've got it again.
An ion trail.

08:23.516 --> 08:25.450
Where does
the trail lead?

08:25.518 --> 08:26.951
System
Sigma Draconis.

08:27.020 --> 08:28.954
Lock on, Mr. Sulu.

08:29.022 --> 08:30.956
Maximum speed.

08:32.025 --> 08:33.457
Warp 6.

08:39.032 --> 08:40.828
No question
about the trail?

08:40.900 --> 08:42.491
No mistake, sir.

08:57.050 --> 09:00.349
Captain 's Log,
Star date 5431.4.

09:00.420 --> 09:02.411
for 15 hours
and 20 minutes

09:02.488 --> 09:04.422
we have been following
the ion trail

09:04.490 --> 09:07.425
of the spaceship
that has Spock's brain.

09:07.493 --> 09:10.291
Time left to us --
8 hours and 40 minutes.

09:10.363 --> 09:12.160
Captain,
I've lost the trail.

09:12.232 --> 09:13.494
All scanners,
extreme sweep.

09:13.566 --> 09:15.500
Aye, sir.

09:19.339 --> 09:20.271
Well?

09:20.340 --> 09:21.364
Nothing, sir.

09:21.441 --> 09:23.136
No signal at all,
Captain.

09:23.209 --> 09:26.235
It's gone, sir.
A sudden deaction shift.

09:26.312 --> 09:27.745
We've lost her trail,

09:27.814 --> 09:30.408
but she went
into that system.

09:30.483 --> 09:34.214
Put a schematic of Sigma
Draconis on the screen.

09:34.287 --> 09:35.276
Aye, Captain.

09:37.023 --> 09:38.456
Read out, Mr. Chekov.

09:40.026 --> 09:41.459
Sun, spectral type,

09:41.527 --> 09:42.459
Gamma 9,

09:42.528 --> 09:43.460
nine planets,

09:43.529 --> 09:45.963
three of them,
Class-M

09:46.032 --> 09:47.966
possessing
sapient life

09:48.034 --> 09:50.559
according to reports
and long-range scanning.

09:50.637 --> 09:52.969
She was breathing our air.

09:53.039 --> 09:55.473
She must've gone
to one of them.

09:55.541 --> 09:58.408
Show us the three
Class-M planets.

10:04.050 --> 10:06.985
The one on the left,
number 3,

10:07.053 --> 10:09.988
rates letter "B"
on the industrial scale.

10:10.056 --> 10:11.990
Earth equivalent
approximately ...

10:12.058 --> 10:13.457
1485.

10:13.526 --> 10:14.458
Yes, sir.

10:14.527 --> 10:17.496
Second planet Class-M,
number 4,

10:17.563 --> 10:18.996
rates letter "G."

10:19.065 --> 10:21.499
Year 2030.

10:21.567 --> 10:23.034
But that ship, Captain,

10:23.102 --> 10:25.036
either it was
many years ahead of us

10:25.104 --> 10:27.470
or the most incredible
design fluke in history.

10:27.540 --> 10:29.804
Third Class-M planet,
Mr. Chekov.

10:29.876 --> 10:30.808
Number 6.

10:30.877 --> 10:32.504
No sign of
industrial development.

10:32.578 --> 10:34.876
At last report,
in a Glacial Age.

10:34.948 --> 10:36.381
Sapient life plentiful,

10:36.449 --> 10:38.508
but on a most
primitive level.

10:38.584 --> 10:40.017
As I understand it,

10:40.086 --> 10:42.020
- there are three Class-M planets,
- Yes, sir.

10:42.088 --> 10:44.613
none of which is capable of
launching an interstellar flight,

10:44.691 --> 10:46.682
- No, sir.
- yet one of them accomplished it.

10:46.759 --> 10:48.522
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you, Mr. Chekov.

10:48.594 --> 10:51.028
Captain, I'm picking up
high energy generation

10:51.097 --> 10:52.496
on planet 6.

10:52.565 --> 10:54.499
That's the primitive
glaciated planet.

10:54.567 --> 10:56.091
The source of it?

10:56.169 --> 10:57.534
It could be natural --

10:57.603 --> 11:00.538
volcanic activity, steam,
any number of causes --

11:00.606 --> 11:01.937
but it's very regular.

11:02.008 --> 11:03.976
What do your surface readings show?

11:04.043 --> 11:05.977
No sign of
organized civilization.

11:06.045 --> 11:08.479
Primitive humanoids picked up
at irregular intervals.

11:08.548 --> 11:10.982
With regular pulsations
of generated energy?

11:11.050 --> 11:13.348
I can't explain it, sir.

11:16.055 --> 11:17.989
I can't afford
to guess wrong.

11:18.057 --> 11:21.493
I've got to choose the right planet
to get there,

11:21.561 --> 11:22.994
find the brain.

11:23.062 --> 11:24.996
8 hours
and 35 minutes.

11:25.064 --> 11:26.497
Recommendations,
Mr. Chekov.

11:26.566 --> 11:27.999
Sigma Draconis 3.

11:28.067 --> 11:30.365
It's closest.
Heaviest population.

11:30.436 --> 11:32.495
But a technological
rating of only 3.

11:32.572 --> 11:35.200
They couldn't put
that ship we saw into space.

11:35.274 --> 11:36.741
None of these planets
could.

11:40.046 --> 11:41.513
I say planet 4, Captain.

11:41.581 --> 11:44.607
At least planet 4 is ahead of 3,
technologically.

11:44.684 --> 11:46.015
But advanced ion propulsion

11:46.085 --> 11:47.518
is beyond
even our capabilities.

11:47.587 --> 11:50.021
It'd be a miracle
if they developed it.

11:50.089 --> 11:53.024
What would they want
with his brain?

11:53.092 --> 11:56.357
What would they want
with Mr. Spock's brain?

11:56.429 --> 11:58.363
Why do they want it?

11:58.431 --> 12:01.025
Yes. Why would they
want it?

12:01.100 --> 12:03.466
8 hours and 34 minutes.

12:03.536 --> 12:06.699
Planet 6 is glaciated,
you say?

12:06.773 --> 12:08.468
Several thousand years,
at least.

12:08.541 --> 12:10.975
Only the Tropical Zone
is ice-free.

12:11.044 --> 12:12.477
But the energy.

12:12.545 --> 12:13.477
Regular.

12:13.546 --> 12:14.979
It's there.

12:15.048 --> 12:16.481
It's real.

12:16.549 --> 12:18.312
Yes, sir.

12:18.384 --> 12:21.410
It doesn't make sense,
but it's there.

12:22.955 --> 12:24.980
Have the transporter room
stand by.

12:25.058 --> 12:27.925
I'm taking a landing party
down to planet 6.

12:27.994 --> 12:29.518
Aye, aye, sir.

12:29.595 --> 12:30.721
A hunch, Captain?

12:32.565 --> 12:33.964
A hunch, Mr. Sulu.

12:35.535 --> 12:38.436
What if you guess wrong,
Captain?

12:38.504 --> 12:41.496
If I guess wrong,
Mr. Spock is dead.

12:41.574 --> 12:43.508
Spock will die.

12:51.350 --> 12:54.410
Captain 's Log,
Star date 4351.5.

12:54.487 --> 12:57.456
We are beaming down to a
primitive glaciated planet

12:57.523 --> 12:59.923
in the Sigma Draconis
star system.

12:59.992 --> 13:02.859
Time left to us
to find Spock's brain --

13:02.929 --> 13:04.863
8 hours and 29 minutes.

13:04.931 --> 13:06.364
Suit temperatures to 72.

13:13.940 --> 13:16.374
Life-form readings,
Mr. Spock --

13:16.442 --> 13:17.875
Mr. Scott?

13:17.944 --> 13:18.876
Scattered.

13:18.945 --> 13:20.378
Widely spaced.

13:20.446 --> 13:21.879
Humanoid, all right.

13:21.948 --> 13:23.176
On the large side.

13:26.686 --> 13:29.883
Watch out. We know
their development is primitive.

13:29.956 --> 13:31.082
Aye.

13:37.396 --> 13:38.886
Readout, Mr. Chekov.

13:38.965 --> 13:40.398
No structures, Captain.

13:40.466 --> 13:42.400
No mechanized objects
that I can read.

13:42.468 --> 13:45.960
No surface consumption,
no generation of energy.

13:49.675 --> 13:51.905
Atmosphere is perfectly
all right, of course.

13:51.978 --> 13:54.412
Temperature,
a high maximum of 40.

13:54.480 --> 13:55.913
Livable.

13:55.982 --> 13:58.212
You have a thick skin.

14:01.020 --> 14:02.351
Captain!

14:05.925 --> 14:09.361
There's someone,
something out there in the rocks.

14:09.428 --> 14:11.862
Five of them.
Humanoid, large.

14:11.931 --> 14:13.364
Phasers on stun.

14:14.934 --> 14:16.868
I want them conscious.

14:45.965 --> 14:48.263
Fire only on my signal.

14:54.073 --> 14:55.404
Flank out.

15:03.916 --> 15:04.848
Chekov.

15:12.425 --> 15:14.359
- Grrr!
- Aah!

15:38.951 --> 15:40.350
We mean you no harm.

15:40.419 --> 15:43.183
We're not your enemies.
We're your friends.

15:43.256 --> 15:46.384
We only wish
to talk to you.

15:47.960 --> 15:49.894
You ...

15:49.962 --> 15:52.055
are not the Others?

15:52.131 --> 15:53.063
No.

15:53.132 --> 15:55.896
We come from
a far place.

15:55.968 --> 15:57.333
We are men.

15:58.938 --> 15:59.870
Men?

15:59.939 --> 16:01.270
Like yourselves.

16:01.340 --> 16:03.831
You are small ...

16:05.411 --> 16:07.208
Like the Others.

16:07.280 --> 16:08.804
Who are the Others?

16:08.881 --> 16:10.849
The givers of pain ...

16:12.885 --> 16:13.817
and delight.

16:13.886 --> 16:17.788
Do they live here
with you?

16:17.857 --> 16:20.849
No. They come.

16:20.926 --> 16:23.087
They give pain
and delight.

16:23.162 --> 16:24.561
Do they come
from the sky?

16:24.630 --> 16:26.359
They are here.

16:27.933 --> 16:29.867
You will see.

16:29.935 --> 16:32.870
The Others
will come for you.

16:32.938 --> 16:36.669
They come ...
for all like us.

16:36.742 --> 16:39.040
Do they come
for your women as well?

16:40.446 --> 16:41.674
Women?

16:41.747 --> 16:43.305
The female of your kind.

16:43.382 --> 16:47.751
Your words say nothing.

16:47.820 --> 16:51.051
Don't you have a mate?

16:53.459 --> 16:54.926
Mate?

16:54.994 --> 16:56.723
A companion.

17:00.499 --> 17:04.935
Will you take us where
we can find the Others?

17:05.003 --> 17:06.835
No one wants
to find them.

17:06.906 --> 17:08.839
We do. We want
to find them.

17:08.907 --> 17:11.308
Take us there,
and we'll let you go.

17:11.377 --> 17:13.003
Captain, 500 meters
in that direction,

17:13.079 --> 17:14.944
there's a foundation
under the surface.

17:15.013 --> 17:16.002
A huge one.

17:16.082 --> 17:17.481
Registrations
all over the place.

17:17.550 --> 17:18.574
Buildings?

17:18.651 --> 17:20.516
Yes, sir. Immensely old,
completely buried.

17:20.586 --> 17:22.019
But they were here once.

17:22.088 --> 17:24.521
Somewhere down there
is where the Others live.

17:24.589 --> 17:26.022
Scotty, find a way down.

17:26.092 --> 17:28.526
No! No!
Do not go there!

17:28.594 --> 17:29.526
It's all right.

17:29.595 --> 17:31.028
No! No!

17:31.097 --> 17:33.531
It's all right.
Let him go.

17:33.599 --> 17:36.534
What could the Others do
to cause such terror?

17:36.602 --> 17:39.036
What was that he said,
"pain and delight"?

17:39.105 --> 17:40.538
A peculiar mixture.

17:40.606 --> 17:43.040
A dead and buried city

17:43.109 --> 17:46.545
on a planet
in a Glacial Age.

17:46.612 --> 17:49.046
And the male humanoid
who doesn't know

17:49.115 --> 17:51.549
the meaning of
the word female.

17:51.617 --> 17:52.549
Captain!

17:55.087 --> 17:56.554
Over here, sir!

17:58.624 --> 18:01.559
There's food in there
and other stuff.

18:01.627 --> 18:04.994
A storehouse for
our muscular friends.

18:05.064 --> 18:07.498
I don't think so --
Scotty.

18:12.772 --> 18:15.502
Metal. Forged, tempered.

18:15.574 --> 18:19.010
Our apish friends
didn't make these.

18:19.078 --> 18:21.012
What do you think?

18:21.080 --> 18:23.014
It could be
a warning device

18:23.082 --> 18:25.516
to keep those creatures
away from the food.

18:25.584 --> 18:28.519
Or the food could be
a lure set by the Others

18:28.587 --> 18:30.020
to bring them in here.

18:30.089 --> 18:32.023
The beam
would be a signal.

18:32.091 --> 18:33.524
And this cave, a trap.

18:33.592 --> 18:36.527
If it traps the creatures
for the Others, Captain,

18:36.595 --> 18:38.028
won't it trap us, too?

18:38.097 --> 18:39.029
Exactly.

18:41.600 --> 18:42.532
Kirk to Enterprise.

18:42.601 --> 18:44.034
Enterprise.
Uhura here.

18:44.103 --> 18:46.537
Have Dr. McCoy
beam down immediately.

18:46.605 --> 18:49.540
Mr. Chekov, you and
the security team will remain here.

18:49.608 --> 18:52.543
We'll be in constant
contact with you.

18:52.611 --> 18:53.543
Aye, sir.

19:15.334 --> 19:17.996
All right, Bones.

19:18.070 --> 19:19.731
Bring him along.

19:39.091 --> 19:41.525
Keep him close
to the right.

19:47.299 --> 19:48.527
Ready?

19:51.604 --> 19:53.538
[Engines Start]

19:53.606 --> 19:57.542
Call Chekov and tell him
to send my stomach down.

20:00.613 --> 20:03.047
It might be a long wait.

20:03.115 --> 20:05.549
We may as well
be comfortable.

20:20.733 --> 20:23.065
Phasers on stun.

20:24.637 --> 20:27.071
Captain, that power
we picked up above,

20:27.139 --> 20:28.572
we're getting closer.

20:28.641 --> 20:29.665
A lot of it?

20:29.742 --> 20:32.074
Enough to push this planet
out of orbit.

20:32.144 --> 20:33.168
What source?

20:33.245 --> 20:37.079
Either a nuclear pile
100 miles across or ...

20:37.149 --> 20:38.582
Or what?

20:38.651 --> 20:40.084
ion power.

20:40.152 --> 20:42.086
[Engines Stop]

20:45.658 --> 20:47.091
We're slowing down.

21:25.631 --> 21:27.064
Is she all right?

21:27.132 --> 21:30.067
I'll have her talking
in a minute.

21:32.137 --> 21:34.071
You do not belong here.

21:34.139 --> 21:35.572
You are not Morg.

21:35.641 --> 21:38.075
Who's in charge?
I wish to speak to him.

21:38.143 --> 21:39.838
Him? What is him?

21:39.912 --> 21:42.574
What have you done
with Spock's brain?

21:42.648 --> 21:45.776
You are not Morg
or Eymorg.

21:45.851 --> 21:47.910
I know nothing
about a brain.

21:47.987 --> 21:48.954
You're lying!

21:49.021 --> 21:51.512
No change in reading.
She doesn't know.

21:59.665 --> 22:03.533
See what you can pick up
on your communicator.

22:03.602 --> 22:05.536
We don't want
to hurt you.

22:07.606 --> 22:09.540
What is this place?

22:09.608 --> 22:13.100
This place is here.

22:13.178 --> 22:14.167
Who are you?

22:14.246 --> 22:15.372
I am Luma.

22:15.447 --> 22:17.039
I am Eymorg.

22:17.116 --> 22:19.778
You are not Eymorg.
You are not Morg.

22:19.852 --> 22:21.820
What are you?

22:23.856 --> 22:26.256
Jim ...

22:26.325 --> 22:28.418
it's no use.

22:28.494 --> 22:29.893
You'll get nothing
from her.

22:29.962 --> 22:31.987
Hers is the mind
of a child.

22:32.064 --> 22:33.463
Captain,
I've got something,

22:33.532 --> 22:36.558
but I can't quite
get a fix on it.

22:38.771 --> 22:39.931
[Spock]
Fascinating.

22:40.005 --> 22:43.566
Activity without end,
but with no volition.

22:43.642 --> 22:44.802
Spock, is that you?

22:44.877 --> 22:46.868
Captain? Captain Kirk?

22:49.148 --> 22:51.082
Yes, Spock.

22:52.651 --> 22:54.209
Yes.

22:54.286 --> 22:56.584
Captain, there is a definite
pleasurable experience

22:56.655 --> 22:59.089
connected with the hearing
of your voice.

22:59.158 --> 23:00.352
Where are you,
Spock?

23:00.426 --> 23:02.087
Is that you, Dr. McCoy,

23:02.161 --> 23:03.253
and are you
with the captain?

23:03.328 --> 23:04.920
Where else
would I be?

23:04.997 --> 23:06.555
Mr. Spock,
where are you?

23:06.632 --> 23:08.031
Engineer Scott as well.

23:08.100 --> 23:11.536
Unfortunately,
I do not know where I am.

23:11.603 --> 23:13.764
We'll get you, Spock.
It won't be long.

23:13.839 --> 23:15.466
A practical idea,
Captain.

23:15.541 --> 23:19.602
It seems unlikely that I
shall be able to get to you.

23:19.678 --> 23:20.975
Quickly!

23:27.720 --> 23:30.052
There she is.
That's the one.

23:30.122 --> 23:32.522
What have you done
with Spock's brain?

24:02.354 --> 24:05.653
Captain 's Log,
Star date 5431.6.

24:05.724 --> 24:08.284
Immediately after making contact
with Spock's brain,

24:08.360 --> 24:10.794
Dr. McCoy,
Engineer Scott, and myself

24:10.863 --> 24:14.799
were taken prisoner inside
a highly complex civilization

24:14.867 --> 24:19.736
hundreds of meters below the surface
of planet Sigma Draconis 7.

24:19.805 --> 24:22.399
The primitive creature
we encountered above

24:22.474 --> 24:25.500
warned us about the givers
of pain and delight

24:25.577 --> 24:29.513
and the frightening consequences
of being captured by them.

24:53.338 --> 24:55.568
What are you?

24:55.641 --> 24:57.438
Why are you here?

24:59.311 --> 25:01.973
You have something
to speak?

25:07.252 --> 25:09.914
What have you done
with Spock's brain?

25:09.988 --> 25:11.455
We do not know Spock.

25:11.523 --> 25:13.286
This is Spock.

25:13.358 --> 25:16.020
You saw him on the ship.

25:16.094 --> 25:17.584
You have his brain.

25:17.663 --> 25:20.689
It must be restored
to him immediately.

25:20.766 --> 25:21.698
Ah, yes, brain.

25:21.767 --> 25:23.701
You spoke to Luma
also of brain,

25:23.769 --> 25:25.703
but we do not
understand.

25:25.771 --> 25:27.705
I do not know
about Luma,

25:27.773 --> 25:29.707
but you were on
the Enterprise.

25:29.775 --> 25:31.208
I do not know
these things.

25:31.276 --> 25:33.210
You came to my ship!

25:33.278 --> 25:35.712
We know only here below
and here above.

25:35.781 --> 25:38.215
This is our place.

25:38.283 --> 25:40.217
You are not Morg.
You are stranger.

25:40.285 --> 25:42.719
I saw you on my ship!

25:42.788 --> 25:43.720
Jim ...

25:48.293 --> 25:51.729
she may not remember ...
or even really know.

25:51.797 --> 25:53.731
Disassociation
could be complete.

25:53.799 --> 25:55.232
It doesn't seem possible

25:55.300 --> 25:58.235
she could have performed surgery
on Spock.

25:59.805 --> 26:00.829
No, it doesn't.

26:00.906 --> 26:02.237
You hurt Luma.

26:02.307 --> 26:04.901
It is not permitted again
to hurt anyone.

26:04.977 --> 26:06.672
Sorry.

26:06.745 --> 26:10.681
We don't want
to hurt anyone.

26:10.749 --> 26:15.186
If you wish to return
to your home, you may go.

26:16.755 --> 26:17.687
No.

26:17.756 --> 26:22.591
We'll stay here
and learn about you

26:22.661 --> 26:25.129
and tell you of us.

26:27.266 --> 26:28.699
Yes, for instance,

26:28.767 --> 26:31.702
above it's cold
and harsh.

26:31.770 --> 26:33.931
And below, it's warm.

26:34.006 --> 26:36.634
The air is fresh.

26:36.708 --> 26:40.041
Aye. There's no sun,
but there's light.

26:42.247 --> 26:44.738
I wish to talk
to those in charge.

26:44.816 --> 26:45.748
In charge?

26:45.817 --> 26:47.910
Yes, the organizers,
the managers ...

26:47.986 --> 26:49.351
the leader
of your people.

26:49.421 --> 26:51.218
I am leader.

26:51.290 --> 26:52.723
There is no other.

26:52.791 --> 26:54.759
That's impossible.

26:54.826 --> 26:56.054
Who built the machines?

26:56.128 --> 26:57.755
Who are the doctors?

26:57.829 --> 27:00.024
Who controls
this complex?

27:00.098 --> 27:01.725
Control?

27:03.235 --> 27:04.793
Controller?

27:04.870 --> 27:07.668
Yes, the Controller.

27:07.739 --> 27:08.671
The Controller.

27:08.740 --> 27:10.674
Who ... Who controls?

27:10.742 --> 27:13.210
I would like to meet --
to see him.

27:13.278 --> 27:15.678
No. It is not permitted.
Never!

27:15.747 --> 27:17.681
Controller is alone.
Apart.

27:17.749 --> 27:19.182
We serve Controller.

27:19.251 --> 27:20.684
No other
is permitted near.

27:20.752 --> 27:21.684
We intend no harm.

27:21.753 --> 27:23.186
You have come
to destroy us.

27:23.255 --> 27:24.688
No, no, no.

27:24.756 --> 27:27.088
We just want to talk to somebody
about Spock's brain.

27:27.159 --> 27:28.183
Brain and brain!

27:28.260 --> 27:30.194
What is brain?

27:30.262 --> 27:33.129
It is Controller,
is it not?

27:33.198 --> 27:35.689
Yes, yes,
in a way it is.

27:35.767 --> 27:39.703
The human brain controls
the individual's functions.

27:39.771 --> 27:41.204
Bones ...

27:41.273 --> 27:43.707
Scotty ...

27:43.775 --> 27:49.714
Spock's brain
controls ...

27:49.781 --> 27:51.214
It's not possible.

27:57.289 --> 28:00.725
Great ... leader.

28:00.792 --> 28:02.225
Great leader!

28:02.294 --> 28:04.285
We come from a far place

28:04.363 --> 28:06.024
to learn from
your Controller.

28:06.098 --> 28:08.658
You lie! You know me.
You have said that.

28:08.734 --> 28:10.497
You came to take back
the Controller.

28:10.569 --> 28:11.661
He is our friend.

28:11.737 --> 28:13.671
You must take us to him.

28:13.739 --> 28:14.865
We beg you.

28:14.940 --> 28:16.168
Soon it will be
too late.

28:16.241 --> 28:18.175
Do not take them,
Kara.

28:18.243 --> 28:20.677
Do not take them
to the Controller!

28:20.746 --> 28:22.008
They will be prevented.

28:22.080 --> 28:23.445
You must take us --

28:31.356 --> 28:34.018
I must learn what to do.

28:34.092 --> 28:35.684
Come with me.

28:35.761 --> 28:37.194
Keep them here.

28:37.262 --> 28:38.194
Yes, mistress.

28:50.575 --> 28:53.703
Ship 's Log.
Lieutenant Sulu recording.

28:53.779 --> 28:55.713
I am holding the Enterprise
in orbit

28:55.781 --> 28:58.215
about
planet Sigma Draconis 7.

28:58.283 --> 29:01.582
Captain Kirk's hunch that
Spock's brain is on this planet

29:01.653 --> 29:03.143
appears to be correct.

29:03.221 --> 29:04.552
Ensign Chekov
remains on the surface

29:04.623 --> 29:06.056
to act as liaison

29:06.124 --> 29:08.456
between the captain
and the Enterprise.

29:17.235 --> 29:19.169
I never felt anything
like that.

29:19.237 --> 29:21.171
Every nerve in my body
was on fire.

29:21.239 --> 29:24.174
I never believed the human organism
could take such pain.

29:24.242 --> 29:25.675
These are on
to stay.

29:25.744 --> 29:28.679
Must be a magnetic lock
of some kind.

29:28.747 --> 29:31.682
No wonder the Morgs
are so obedient...

29:31.750 --> 29:33.183
or terrified.

29:36.755 --> 29:38.689
How is this place
kept functioning

29:38.757 --> 29:41.885
by the primitive minds
we've met?

29:47.532 --> 29:50.194
Those women could
never have set up

29:50.268 --> 29:51.701
anything as
complex as this.

29:51.770 --> 29:53.704
Why, that takes
engineering genius.

29:53.772 --> 29:57.208
But there's no sign of engineering
genius in those women.

29:57.275 --> 30:00.210
They were smart enough
to invent these training devices.

30:00.278 --> 30:02.974
What a way to maintain
control over a man.

30:04.850 --> 30:07.216
"Pain and delight,"
he said up above.

30:07.285 --> 30:09.719
I'm sure you noticed
the delight aspect.

30:09.788 --> 30:12.723
Yes, I certainly did notice
those delightful aspects.

30:12.791 --> 30:13.758
But that, too,

30:13.825 --> 30:16.225
was strictly under command
of the women.

30:16.294 --> 30:19.229
How does Spock's brain
fit into this?

30:19.297 --> 30:20.730
With a communicator,

30:20.799 --> 30:23.734
we might be able
to find out.

30:28.807 --> 30:31.742
This fellow is keeping us
from our property.

30:31.810 --> 30:34.745
Isn't there a way
to correct that situation?

30:34.813 --> 30:36.747
Science might
provide an answer.

30:36.815 --> 30:38.248
It does, Captain.

30:38.316 --> 30:40.511
Agreed, Doctor.

31:05.777 --> 31:07.506
Science will triumph.

31:07.579 --> 31:09.012
Come on, Scotty.

31:09.080 --> 31:13.210
Bones, give them something
to keep them out for a while.

31:13.285 --> 31:14.217
Spock.

31:14.286 --> 31:15.719
Spock.

31:15.787 --> 31:17.687
Come on, Spock.

31:18.823 --> 31:21.724
Spock, you were on
this frequency, Spock.

31:21.793 --> 31:24.227
Yes, Captain,
lam still here.

31:24.296 --> 31:27.231
Have you returned
to the Enterprise?

31:27.299 --> 31:28.231
No.

31:28.300 --> 31:31.235
We might be able
to locate you,

31:31.303 --> 31:35.239
if you gave us some idea of
what they were using you for.

31:35.307 --> 31:36.239
Is it medical?

31:36.308 --> 31:37.900
I am not certain.

31:37.976 --> 31:41.241
I seem to have a body
which stretches into infinity.

31:41.313 --> 31:42.245
Body?

31:42.314 --> 31:44.305
Why, you have none.

31:44.382 --> 31:46.475
Then what am l?

31:46.551 --> 31:49.543
You are
a disembodied brain.

31:49.621 --> 31:50.645
Fascinating.

31:50.722 --> 31:53.247
It could explain much,
Doctor.

31:53.325 --> 31:56.260
My medulla oblongata
is hard at work

31:56.328 --> 31:57.260
apparently breathing,

31:57.329 --> 31:59.263
apparently
pumping blood,

31:59.331 --> 32:02.266
apparently maintaining
a normal physiologic temperature.

32:02.334 --> 32:04.825
Spock, we don't
have time for that.

32:04.903 --> 32:08.339
Why are you endangering
your lives by coming here?

32:08.406 --> 32:10.567
We came to put you back.

32:10.642 --> 32:11.768
Where are you?

32:11.843 --> 32:13.435
Back where?

32:13.511 --> 32:15.206
Back into your body.

32:15.280 --> 32:17.714
We brought it
along with us.

32:17.782 --> 32:19.147
Thoughtful, Captain,

32:19.217 --> 32:20.775
but probably impractical.

32:20.852 --> 32:22.717
While I might
trust the doctor

32:22.787 --> 32:25.347
to remove a splinter
or lance a boil,

32:25.423 --> 32:28.722
I do not believe he has
the knowledge to restore a brain.

32:28.793 --> 32:29.885
Thank you.

32:29.961 --> 32:32.054
No denigration
intended, Dr. McCoy.

32:32.130 --> 32:35.190
That skill does not yet
exist in the galaxy.

32:35.267 --> 32:37.735
The skill to remove it
exists right here.

32:37.802 --> 32:39.736
Restoring it must
also be possible.

32:39.804 --> 32:42.466
We've got
to get to you now.

32:42.540 --> 32:45.737
Captain, I appreciate the risks
you're taking on my behalf,

32:45.810 --> 32:48.244
but I must insist
they are worthwhile

32:48.313 --> 32:50.747
only if there's a reasonable chance
for success.

32:50.815 --> 32:53.249
How much time
has elapsed since--

32:53.318 --> 32:55.252
18 hours and 12 minutes.

32:55.320 --> 32:58.255
Dr. McCoy must've told you
That 24 hours

32:58.323 --> 33:00.086
is the maximum
my body can--

33:00.158 --> 33:02.058
I told him.

33:02.127 --> 33:06.826
That leaves us exactly 5 hours
and 48 minutes, Spock.

33:06.898 --> 33:10.197
It does seem too brief
to develop such skills,

33:10.268 --> 33:11.235
does it not?

33:11.303 --> 33:13.203
Yes.

33:13.271 --> 33:14.260
Very brief.

33:14.339 --> 33:16.705
That's why we must
get to you immediately.

33:16.775 --> 33:18.709
Beam us a signal
to home in on.

33:18.777 --> 33:20.210
Acknowledged.

33:20.278 --> 33:22.712
[Beep]

33:22.781 --> 33:23.713
Got it.

33:23.782 --> 33:25.215
Bones.

33:54.813 --> 33:56.144
Oh, Spock,
one question.

33:56.214 --> 33:57.272
Yes, Captain.

33:57.349 --> 33:59.249
We've got pain-giving
devices attached to us.

33:59.317 --> 34:01.251
Tell us how
to get them off.

34:01.319 --> 34:03.685
I shall give it
top priority.

34:11.529 --> 34:13.463
Captain, I have
an answer for you.

34:13.531 --> 34:17.058
It seems your pain bands
are manually controlled.

34:17.135 --> 34:21.333
The red button on a bracelet
releases them.

34:21.406 --> 34:24.273
I know that does not
make much sense.

34:24.342 --> 34:26.367
Oh, yes, it does,
Spock.

34:40.492 --> 34:43.188
Keep concentrating,
Spock.

34:43.261 --> 34:45.252
Keep concentrating, Spock.

34:52.003 --> 34:53.937
Must be in there,
Captain.

35:17.061 --> 35:18.995
Jim...

35:19.063 --> 35:19.995
Spock...

35:20.064 --> 35:21.554
no pain.

35:38.516 --> 35:39.710
No.

35:44.255 --> 35:46.018
Go away.

36:11.382 --> 36:13.907
You must not take
the Controller away.

36:13.985 --> 36:15.418
We will all die!

36:15.487 --> 36:18.422
The Controller is
young and powerful.

36:18.490 --> 36:19.422
Perfect!

36:19.491 --> 36:21.425
How very flattering.

36:21.493 --> 36:24.428
You will give life to my people
for 10,000 years.

36:24.496 --> 36:25.929
You'll find
another Controller.

36:25.997 --> 36:27.430
The old one
is finished!

36:27.499 --> 36:29.433
There is no other
than this

36:29.501 --> 36:31.435
and will not be another
for 10,000 years.

36:31.503 --> 36:36.941
Spock, you're in a black box
tied in with light rays

36:37.008 --> 36:39.943
into a complex
control panel.

36:40.011 --> 36:41.945
Fascinating.

36:42.013 --> 36:43.947
You say
you're breathing,

36:44.015 --> 36:45.949
pumping blood,

36:46.017 --> 36:47.450
maintaining
temperature?

36:47.519 --> 36:52.957
Is it possible that you're
recirculating air,

36:53.024 --> 36:54.457
running
heating plants,

36:54.526 --> 36:55.458
purifying water?

36:55.527 --> 36:56.994
Indeed, Captain.

36:57.061 --> 36:59.461
That is unquestionably
part of what lam doing.

36:59.531 --> 37:00.964
He must stay!

37:01.032 --> 37:02.897
He will not stay.

37:06.971 --> 37:08.905
Now, you took his brain.

37:08.973 --> 37:10.907
You will put it back.

37:10.975 --> 37:12.909
How did you do it?

37:12.977 --> 37:14.410
I do not know.

37:14.479 --> 37:15.571
She couldn't, Jim.

37:15.647 --> 37:18.081
Her mind is functioning
on a very simple level.

37:18.149 --> 37:20.913
Mental faculties here
seem to be almost atrophied

37:20.985 --> 37:22.782
because of non-use.

37:22.854 --> 37:24.412
She was on
the Enterprise.

37:24.489 --> 37:25.922
How did you do it?

37:25.990 --> 37:27.423
It was
the old knowledge.

37:27.492 --> 37:28.925
How do you get it?

37:28.993 --> 37:31.427
I put upon my head
the teacher.

37:31.496 --> 37:32.929
What is the teacher?

37:32.997 --> 37:35.932
The great teacher of
all the ancient knowledge.

37:36.000 --> 37:37.831
If I may explain, Captain,

37:37.902 --> 37:39.927
she refers to the tape
storehouse of knowledge

37:40.004 --> 37:42.438
of the builders
of this place.

37:42.507 --> 37:45.442
I scanned it.
A most impressive store.

37:56.921 --> 37:58.752
How does it work?
Show us.

37:58.823 --> 37:59.755
I cannot.

37:59.824 --> 38:01.314
You must tell us.

38:01.392 --> 38:02.586
I cannot.

38:02.660 --> 38:05.788
Only by command of the ancients
may I understand.

38:05.863 --> 38:07.888
How does it work?
Show us!

38:07.966 --> 38:09.399
We'll protect you.

38:09.467 --> 38:12.664
It is a device
with feeding circuits.

38:12.737 --> 38:15.001
They lead into the mind
of the priestess leader.

38:15.073 --> 38:18.907
Its use is strictly
predetermined by the builders.

38:19.978 --> 38:21.912
No! Knowledge is forbidden!

38:21.980 --> 38:23.914
I must not know the secret!

38:23.982 --> 38:25.415
I'll be punished!

38:58.449 --> 38:59.848
Gentlemen...

38:59.917 --> 39:03.284
the Controller's explanation
of the functioning of the teacher

39:03.354 --> 39:04.651
is essentially correct.

39:04.722 --> 39:07.555
However, he is giving
no credit to me.

39:07.625 --> 39:10.788
I provide the means
whereby the knowledge is used.

39:10.862 --> 39:11.988
Without me, Captain--

39:12.063 --> 39:14.793
Without you there could be
no delicate miracle

39:14.866 --> 39:16.959
that kept Spock's
brain alive.

39:17.035 --> 39:18.468
Thank you, Doctor.

39:18.536 --> 39:19.969
That was very gracious.

39:20.038 --> 39:24.668
Yes. From the very first,
I appreciated your ability.

39:24.742 --> 39:26.175
Good, Captain Kirk.

39:26.244 --> 39:29.179
Then you also appreciate
that without the teacher,

39:29.247 --> 39:32.182
I would not have
the knowledge to use

39:32.250 --> 39:34.810
that which you have
thoughtfully provided.

39:39.424 --> 39:41.858
That phaser
is set to kill.

39:41.926 --> 39:44.156
So it is.

39:44.228 --> 39:48.096
That is the knowledge
you have brought me.

39:59.544 --> 40:00.875
Do not move.

40:00.945 --> 40:02.879
If your weapon kills,
it will kill you.

40:02.947 --> 40:05.541
We didn't bring you the knowledge
of killing.

40:05.616 --> 40:07.584
If you continue,
you'll kill Spock.

40:07.652 --> 40:09.643
The Controller die?

40:09.721 --> 40:12.656
The Controller will
live for 10,000 years,

40:12.724 --> 40:15.056
and we shall give him
all our devotion.

40:15.126 --> 40:17.060
But Spock will be dead.

40:17.128 --> 40:18.925
His body's dying
this minute.

40:18.996 --> 40:20.930
Why do you
not understand?

40:20.998 --> 40:23.558
The need of my people
for their Controller

40:23.634 --> 40:25.625
is greater than your need
for your friend.

40:25.703 --> 40:27.398
No one may kill a man!

40:27.472 --> 40:29.565
Not for any purpose.
It cannot be condoned.

40:29.640 --> 40:30.732
Do not!

40:32.376 --> 40:35.743
I do not know killing.
I do not wish to kill.

40:35.813 --> 40:37.906
[ Groans ]

40:41.919 --> 40:44.513
The commandment
must be fulfilled.

40:44.589 --> 40:46.079
You must help us.

40:47.959 --> 40:49.893
When you came
to the ship,

40:49.961 --> 40:51.622
you had the knowledge.

40:51.696 --> 40:54.631
Yet, when we came here,
you didn't.

40:54.699 --> 40:55.825
Correct.

40:55.900 --> 40:57.834
How long does
the knowledge last?

40:57.902 --> 40:59.927
Three of your hours.

41:00.004 --> 41:01.801
That would be
Just enough time.

41:01.873 --> 41:03.807
If you had
the knowledge,

41:03.875 --> 41:06.036
could you restore
what you've taken?

41:06.110 --> 41:07.873
I would not.

41:07.945 --> 41:10.038
You must help us.

41:10.114 --> 41:12.548
You must restore
with that knowledge

41:12.617 --> 41:14.050
what you have taken.

41:14.118 --> 41:15.107
No!

41:15.186 --> 41:18.121
You must put back
what you have taken.

41:18.189 --> 41:20.623
I will not betray
my people.

41:20.691 --> 41:22.556
The Controller will stay.

41:41.078 --> 41:42.511
Jim, it worked for her.

41:42.580 --> 41:43.877
It might work for me.

41:43.948 --> 41:45.472
She is an alien.

41:45.550 --> 41:47.882
The configurations
of her brain are different.

41:47.952 --> 41:51.888
It could cause irreparable damage
to your human brain, Doctor.

41:51.956 --> 41:53.218
I'm a surgeon already.

41:53.291 --> 41:55.225
If I could learn
these techniques,

41:55.293 --> 41:57.318
I might be able
to retain them.

41:57.395 --> 42:00.421
Captain, you might lose
the doctor that way.

42:00.498 --> 42:01.487
He might,

42:01.566 --> 42:04.626
but we're sure to lose
you if I don't try.

42:04.702 --> 42:07.830
I cannot allow you to jeopardize
your life for me.

42:07.905 --> 42:09.338
Spock,
didn't you hear?

42:09.407 --> 42:13.036
I might be able
to retain and bring

42:13.110 --> 42:15.544
these techniques
to the world.

42:15.613 --> 42:18.548
Jim, isn't it worth
that risk?

42:18.616 --> 42:22.780
Wouldn't you insist upon
taking such a risk yourself?

42:26.624 --> 42:28.057
Go ahead, Doctor.

42:28.125 --> 42:29.558
Put the teacher on.

42:33.631 --> 42:34.563
No!

43:24.949 --> 43:26.041
Of course.

43:28.853 --> 43:30.047
Of course.

43:32.123 --> 43:34.057
A child could do it.

43:36.127 --> 43:38.061
A child could do it.

43:48.139 --> 43:51.074
Captain's Log.
Star date 5432.3.

43:51.142 --> 43:54.578
Dr. McCoy is proceeding
to restore Spock's brain.

43:54.645 --> 43:56.078
Our problem--

43:56.147 --> 43:58.081
we do not know how long

43:58.149 --> 44:01.084
his increased surgical knowledge
will stay with him.

44:01.152 --> 44:04.519
Any additional attempt to use
the teaching device is impossible.

44:04.588 --> 44:06.522
It would kill
my medical officer.

44:06.590 --> 44:08.524
I haven't seen
anything like it.

44:08.592 --> 44:10.526
He's operating
at warp speed.

44:10.594 --> 44:14.030
I'd like a try
at that teacher myself.

44:14.098 --> 44:16.032
You will have him
back,

44:16.100 --> 44:17.533
and we will
be destroyed.

44:17.601 --> 44:19.034
No. You won't
be destroyed.

44:19.103 --> 44:21.867
You'll be without your Controller
for the first time.

44:21.939 --> 44:24.373
But you'll be much better off,
I think.

44:24.442 --> 44:25.636
We will die.

44:25.710 --> 44:28.770
You will live and develop
as you should have.

44:28.846 --> 44:31.280
All this shouldn't
have been done for you.

44:31.349 --> 44:35.786
Now the women here below and the men
here above will control together.

44:35.853 --> 44:38.651
They will not help us
without the pain.

44:38.723 --> 44:41.317
There are other ways.
You'll discover them.

44:41.392 --> 44:43.826
You must move to the surface,
you understand.

44:43.894 --> 44:46.328
We will die above
in the cold.

44:46.397 --> 44:47.728
No, you won't.

44:47.798 --> 44:49.891
You'll learn to build houses,

44:49.967 --> 44:52.162
to keep warm,
to work.

44:52.236 --> 44:54.227
We'll help you
for a while.

44:54.305 --> 44:57.240
Humans have survived
under worse conditions.

44:57.308 --> 44:59.242
It's a matter of evolution.

44:59.310 --> 45:00.675
You'll do fine.

45:00.745 --> 45:01.677
Captain Kirk.

45:04.248 --> 45:05.681
What is it?

45:05.750 --> 45:07.217
He's forgetting.

45:09.453 --> 45:10.886
I can't--I--

45:10.955 --> 45:12.183
Bones.

45:13.758 --> 45:14.690
Bones.

45:14.759 --> 45:16.192
All the ganglia--
the nerves.

45:16.260 --> 45:18.524
There are a million
of them.

45:18.596 --> 45:20.757
What am I supposed to do?

45:20.831 --> 45:23.925
What am I supposed to do?

45:24.001 --> 45:26.196
Bones, you can't stop now.

45:26.270 --> 45:29.205
I'm trying to thread a needle
with a sledgehammer.

45:29.273 --> 45:32.674
What am I supposed to do?
I can't remember.

45:32.743 --> 45:34.677
I don't remember.

45:36.113 --> 45:37.045
Bones.

45:37.114 --> 45:39.014
No one can restore a brain.

45:39.083 --> 45:40.209
You could.

45:40.284 --> 45:42.878
A while ago,
it was child's play.

45:53.798 --> 45:55.595
Captain's Log : Supplemental.

45:55.666 --> 45:59.102
Our race against time to save
Spock's life may prove futile.

45:59.170 --> 46:01.263
Dr. McCoy has lost
the surgical knowledge

46:01.338 --> 46:02.930
he obtained
from the teacher.

46:03.007 --> 46:06.101
He has been drawing on his own
skills and surgical techniques

46:06.177 --> 46:08.543
in an attempt
to continue the operation,

46:08.612 --> 46:11.206
but he is faltering
and uncertain.

46:11.282 --> 46:14.877
In a desperate hope that he can draw
on Spock's brain for assistance,

46:14.952 --> 46:17.113
I instructed Dr. McCoy
to give priority

46:17.188 --> 46:19.850
to connecting
Spock's vocal chords.

46:28.165 --> 46:29.655
Well?

46:29.733 --> 46:32.668
He's dying,
and I can't stop it.

46:33.971 --> 46:35.598
Yes...

46:36.674 --> 46:38.073
Dr. McCoy...

46:38.142 --> 46:39.234
Spock.

46:41.245 --> 46:44.544
If you will finish
reconnecting my speech center,

46:44.615 --> 46:46.242
I might be able to help.

46:48.285 --> 46:49.718
Speech center.

46:51.288 --> 46:54.621
Yes. That's correct.

46:55.793 --> 46:57.727
One thing at a time.

46:58.796 --> 47:00.457
Ahh...

47:00.531 --> 47:01.896
Ahh...

47:03.300 --> 47:04.358
Mmm...

47:04.435 --> 47:06.027
that's better.

47:06.103 --> 47:10.836
Now, Doctor,
try the sonic separator.

47:10.908 --> 47:13.103
Sonic separator.

47:13.177 --> 47:16.908
Yes, I believe I already have
some sensation of feeling.

47:16.981 --> 47:18.778
Please stimulate
the nerve endings

47:18.849 --> 47:20.612
and observe
the physical reactions,

47:20.684 --> 47:21.810
one by one.

47:23.287 --> 47:27.223
In each case, I shall tell you
when the probe is correct.

47:27.291 --> 47:30.283
You will then seal using
the tri-laser connector.

47:30.361 --> 47:32.352
Tri-laser connector.

47:37.501 --> 47:38.490
Ready?

47:38.569 --> 47:39.797
Ready.

47:41.272 --> 47:43.706
Right forefinger.

47:45.042 --> 47:46.373
Correct.

47:48.412 --> 47:49.344
Right...

47:51.048 --> 47:51.980
wrist.

47:53.284 --> 47:54.273
Correct.

47:57.221 --> 47:58.779
Right elbow.

48:01.292 --> 48:02.224
Correct.

48:02.293 --> 48:03.726
Very good, Doctor.

48:05.229 --> 48:06.662
I'll never live this down--

48:06.730 --> 48:09.164
this Vulcan telling me
how to operate.

48:20.244 --> 48:21.404
Closed.

48:21.478 --> 48:23.173
Well?

48:23.247 --> 48:26.978
How do I know? I could have made
a thousand mistakes.

48:27.051 --> 48:30.543
Sealing nerve endings,
Joining ganglia.

48:30.621 --> 48:33.681
The fluid balance
is correct, but...

48:33.757 --> 48:35.315
I don't know.

48:45.269 --> 48:47.203
Congratulations, Doctor,
and thank you.

48:47.271 --> 48:48.704
How do you feel, Spock?

48:48.772 --> 48:51.866
On the whole, Captain,
I believe I'm quite fit.

48:51.942 --> 48:53.341
It's fascinating.

48:53.410 --> 48:56.345
A remarkable example
of a retrograde civilization.

48:56.413 --> 48:59.746
At the peak, advanced beyond
any of our capabilities

48:59.817 --> 49:03.253
and now operating at this
primitive level which you saw.

49:03.320 --> 49:05.686
And it all began
thousands of years ago

49:05.756 --> 49:07.348
when a Glacial Age
reoccurred.

49:07.424 --> 49:10.018
This underground complex
was developed for the women.

49:10.094 --> 49:11.527
The men remained above.

49:11.595 --> 49:14.029
And a male-female schism
took place.

49:14.098 --> 49:15.531
A fascinating cultural
development of--

49:15.599 --> 49:18.261
I knew it was wrong.
I shouldn't have done it.

49:18.335 --> 49:19.324
What's that?

49:19.403 --> 49:22.167
I should have never
reconnected his mouth.

49:26.677 --> 49:29.737
Well, we took the risk,
Doctor.

49:30.748 --> 49:32.181
As I was saying,

49:32.249 --> 49:34.877
a fascinating cultural
development of the kind

49:34.952 --> 49:36.886
which hasn't been seen
in ages.

49:36.954 --> 49:40.253
The last such occurrence
took place on old Earth.
