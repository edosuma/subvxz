00:10.260 --> 00:11.637
Have you seen this?

00:14.298 --> 00:16.225
That's Kevin Jesquire.

00:16.391 --> 00:17.435
- We work together.
- I know.

00:17.601 --> 00:18.744
He was just arrested

00:18.869 --> 00:20.079
for selling trade secrets

00:20.204 --> 00:21.547
to a rival pharmaceutical company.

00:21.672 --> 00:22.815
It's all over the news.

00:22.981 --> 00:24.483
Holy shit.

00:24.608 --> 00:26.452
That's the reason
my company went under.

00:26.577 --> 00:28.070
That's why my boss killed himself.

00:28.236 --> 00:29.421
Terrible.

00:29.546 --> 00:31.156
Everyone is trying to
get an interview

00:31.281 --> 00:32.783
with this guy's lawyer,
but he's turning them all down.

00:32.949 --> 00:35.160
Well, under the circumstances...

00:35.327 --> 00:37.496
The lawyer's your dad.

00:37.662 --> 00:38.831
An exclusive like this

00:38.956 --> 00:40.332
could really get my
career back on track.

00:40.591 --> 00:43.001
Yeah, well...
The thing is,

00:43.126 --> 00:45.212
my-my dad and I don't really
talk much anymore, so...

00:45.378 --> 00:47.172
I understand.

00:47.297 --> 00:48.640
I mean, it's just that

00:48.765 --> 00:50.509
ever since I freaked out on the air,

00:50.634 --> 00:52.411
and that whole "squishy tits"
thing went viral,

00:52.536 --> 00:55.639
my career is just a total joke.

00:55.873 --> 00:57.416
I'm sorry, I-I-I shouldn't be
complaining to you.

00:57.541 --> 00:58.851
It's not like it's your fault.

00:59.450 --> 01:00.219
Or is it?

01:00.344 --> 01:01.479
I'm the idiot

01:01.645 --> 01:02.721
who skipped lunch that day.

01:02.846 --> 01:04.355
I-I still can't believe

01:04.480 --> 01:06.592
that low blood sugar
could do that to me, I mean...

01:06.717 --> 01:08.560
Squishy tit.
Squishy tit.

01:08.685 --> 01:10.885
Squish-squish-squishy tit-tit,

01:11.010 --> 01:12.823
squish-squish-squishy tit-tit, t-tit.

01:12.989 --> 01:14.299
Oh, Wilfred!

01:14.424 --> 01:16.535
He's always trying to
make me feel better.

01:16.701 --> 01:18.746
What happened to his face?

01:18.912 --> 01:21.106
Aw, he's been wandering
into Gene's garden lately.

01:21.231 --> 01:22.875
I think he scratched himself

01:23.100 --> 01:24.752
on some rosebushes.

01:26.127 --> 01:28.447
Ugh... I gotta run.

01:28.572 --> 01:30.341
I just got my next
assignment for "the squish."

01:30.574 --> 01:33.585
- The squish?
- It's this stupid 30-second segment

01:33.710 --> 01:35.053
they're making me do now.

01:35.178 --> 01:36.688
Today, I'm profiling a guy who claims

01:36.813 --> 01:38.182
to have the largest
forehead in Glendale.

01:38.348 --> 01:40.017
I'm sorry.

01:40.183 --> 01:41.660
Hey.

01:41.785 --> 01:44.021
I'm just one great story
away from a comeback, right?

01:51.461 --> 01:52.738
Jenna...

01:54.406 --> 01:56.200
I-I'll ask my dad.

01:56.366 --> 01:57.910
Really?

01:58.076 --> 01:59.244
It's worth a shot.

01:59.369 --> 02:00.679
Oh, God...

02:00.804 --> 02:03.439
Thank you so much!
You're the best.

02:05.375 --> 02:07.519
You're not actually gonna
call your dad, are you?

02:07.644 --> 02:09.321
I don't want to.

02:09.446 --> 02:12.024
But the least I can do is
help her get her big story.

02:12.149 --> 02:14.326
I'm the one who left that
stupid pot candy lying around.

02:14.451 --> 02:16.679
I mean, she's beating herself up
for my mistake.

02:16.920 --> 02:18.564
Well, if you want to
make her feel better,

02:18.689 --> 02:19.865
just tell her the truth.

02:19.990 --> 02:21.033
After everything she's been through?

02:21.158 --> 02:22.568
She'd never forgive me.

02:22.693 --> 02:25.571
And since when are you
the poster boy for honesty?

02:25.696 --> 02:28.440
Rosebushes didn't do that.
Okay, look.

02:28.565 --> 02:31.109
I didn't want to bring it up
in front of Jenna, but...

02:31.234 --> 02:32.644
I got into a little scuffle

02:32.769 --> 02:35.214
with several members
of our Dobie community.

02:35.339 --> 02:37.533
Oh, I'm sorry.
"Doberman."

02:37.699 --> 02:39.218
"Dobie" is <i>their</i> word.

02:39.343 --> 02:40.819
I haven't seen any dobermans
in the neighborhood.

02:40.944 --> 02:42.654
They're fast, Ryan.

02:42.779 --> 02:44.289
Three of bastards jumped me

02:44.414 --> 02:45.824
whilst I was in the back alley,

02:45.949 --> 02:47.783
taking the trash out of the trash.

02:48.126 --> 02:49.328
I gave as good as I got,

02:49.453 --> 02:51.797
but in the end
I was simply outnumbered.

02:51.922 --> 02:53.665
Looks like they've struck

02:53.790 --> 02:55.632
at the very heart
of our cat community, also.

02:55.757 --> 02:56.343
What?

02:56.560 --> 02:58.237
So you're just gonna
blame them for everything?

02:58.362 --> 02:59.597
Ryan...

02:59.763 --> 03:01.573
If I'm quick to point pads at Dobies,

03:01.698 --> 03:03.976
it's not because they're
a vicious, poorly trained

03:04.101 --> 03:05.511
mongrel breed who fail to assimilate

03:05.636 --> 03:08.013
and hunt in packs, okay?

03:08.138 --> 03:09.405
It's because they're black.

03:11.483 --> 03:13.218
So then another Dobie comes up,

03:13.343 --> 03:14.786
and I'm like, snap-kick, smack!

03:14.911 --> 03:16.455
And then another
Dobie's like, scratch!

03:16.580 --> 03:18.157
That's how I got this.
And I'm like, bang!

03:18.323 --> 03:20.267
And then these two Dobies
come out from behind,

03:20.392 --> 03:22.578
- and I'm like, reverse double-fist, bang.
- Hold on.

03:22.744 --> 03:24.265
- There were five Dobies?
- Yeah.

03:24.390 --> 03:26.457
- You said there were three Dobies.
- What's the difference?

03:26.623 --> 03:27.958
Two Dobies.

03:28.124 --> 03:29.501
It's not a numbers game, Ryan.

03:29.667 --> 03:31.045
What'd you say?

03:31.211 --> 03:32.437
It was... not a numbers game?

03:32.562 --> 03:33.714
No, after that.

03:33.930 --> 03:35.674
Did you hear that?

03:35.840 --> 03:37.259
- No.
- Wilfred...

03:37.425 --> 03:39.602
Is there a cat in here?

03:41.138 --> 03:42.264
What have you done?

03:42.430 --> 03:45.417
It's not what I've done,

03:45.542 --> 03:46.919
Ryan...

03:47.044 --> 03:49.278
It's what I'm going to do!

03:50.605 --> 03:53.258
What the hell is that?

03:53.383 --> 03:55.152
- You didn't know that was there?
- No.

03:55.419 --> 03:57.162
Well, I guess there's
a lot of things you don't know.

03:57.287 --> 03:58.739
For instance,

03:58.955 --> 04:02.668
did you know there's
a coin behind your ear?

04:02.793 --> 04:05.671
Oh... never mind, it was just
the way the light was reflecting

04:05.796 --> 04:06.914
off the back of your ear.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.374
Anyway.

04:14.237 --> 04:15.547
Is that the cat from the poster?

04:15.713 --> 04:17.675
What the hell is going on?

04:17.841 --> 04:19.927
Why are there cats
in a pit in my basement?

04:20.093 --> 04:21.687
Why, Ryan?

04:21.812 --> 04:23.979
Because they took everything from me.

04:30.487 --> 04:33.107
Okay, you remember
the scratch on my face, right?

04:33.273 --> 04:35.401
The one that's still there?
Yes.

04:35.567 --> 04:37.820
It wasn't done by Dobies.

04:37.986 --> 04:39.988
Yeah. I got that.

04:40.154 --> 04:41.540
I was in Gene's garden.

04:41.665 --> 04:42.825
That much is true.

04:44.868 --> 04:47.546
His green lawn lay freshly mowed.

04:47.671 --> 04:51.249
Sprinkler rainbows
dazzling in the sun.

04:51.374 --> 04:54.143
A Fluffy tail swaying in the breeze.

04:55.979 --> 04:58.690
A welcoming purr.

04:58.815 --> 04:59.958
An invitation?

05:00.083 --> 05:01.260
A game?

05:02.719 --> 05:06.365
I wagged my tail,

05:06.490 --> 05:08.758
and smiled on approach.

05:10.160 --> 05:12.871
That's when...

05:13.146 --> 05:14.673
A hiss, a scratch,

05:14.798 --> 05:16.675
so fast...

05:16.800 --> 05:19.578
Open paws, smacks to the face,

05:19.703 --> 05:21.880
again, and again...

05:22.005 --> 05:23.407
I just wanted it to stop,

05:24.007 --> 05:25.550
and all I could hear was

05:25.675 --> 05:27.219
the words of my attacker:

05:27.344 --> 05:28.887
"Meow! Meow!

05:29.012 --> 05:30.330
<i>Meow!"</i>

05:31.882 --> 05:34.960
Well, who's meowing now, bitches?

05:35.126 --> 05:36.395
There are six cats in there.

05:36.520 --> 05:37.671
Which one scratched you?

05:37.837 --> 05:39.264
Does it matter, Ryan?

05:39.389 --> 05:40.883
They've all scratched someone.

05:41.049 --> 05:43.051
So what are you planning to do?

05:43.217 --> 05:44.670
Kill them.

05:44.795 --> 05:47.673
But first, I will torture them.

05:47.798 --> 05:50.108
by driving them insane.

05:51.684 --> 05:54.188
Pitiful fools.

05:54.471 --> 05:56.948
Oh, you want the string,
but you'll never catch it.

05:57.073 --> 05:58.317
Look at them, Ryan!

05:58.483 --> 06:00.444
- They're losing their minds!
- Wilfred...

06:00.610 --> 06:01.887
These are pets.

06:02.012 --> 06:03.197
People will be looking for them.

06:03.363 --> 06:04.589
They're cats, Ryan.

06:04.714 --> 06:05.949
No one cares.
Six cats missing

06:06.115 --> 06:07.592
in the same neighborhood.

06:07.717 --> 06:09.919
That doesn't happen
every day, it's...

06:11.621 --> 06:14.249
... A big deal.

06:14.415 --> 06:15.834
The string of disappearing cats

06:15.959 --> 06:17.836
has struck fear into
the hearts of animal lovers

06:17.961 --> 06:19.071
in this tight-knit community.

06:19.196 --> 06:20.672
We can only wait and pray

06:20.797 --> 06:21.973
for their safe return.

06:22.098 --> 06:24.076
In Venice Beach, I'm Jenna Muller,

06:24.201 --> 06:26.804
- and this is "The Squish."
- And cut.

06:26.970 --> 06:28.413
Nice job, Squishy T.

06:28.538 --> 06:31.016
Thanks, Rob.

06:31.182 --> 06:33.251
That was... gripping.

06:33.376 --> 06:34.812
Very dramatic.

06:35.045 --> 06:37.622
Come on, Ryan.
It's a missing pet story.

06:37.747 --> 06:41.126
It's one step above
a preschool head lice outbreak.

06:41.251 --> 06:43.404
But thanks for suggesting it.

06:45.422 --> 06:46.908
Have you heard from your dad yet?

06:47.074 --> 06:48.366
Y-yeah.

06:48.491 --> 06:51.036
He said no. Sorry.

06:51.161 --> 06:52.997
Another lie, Ryan?
That's okay.

06:53.163 --> 06:54.573
It's probably a sign

06:54.698 --> 06:55.941
that I should be getting
out of this business.

06:56.066 --> 06:57.743
I have a cousin in Long Beach

06:57.868 --> 06:59.644
who sells sleep apnea machines.

06:59.769 --> 07:01.923
She says they're always
looking for new reps.

07:02.089 --> 07:04.050
But this job is your dream.

07:04.307 --> 07:07.119
Well, maybe it's time
that I face reality.

07:07.244 --> 07:08.972
Tits, let's move!

07:10.280 --> 07:11.690
Don't give up.

07:11.815 --> 07:13.792
Maybe this cat story will
develop into something.

07:13.917 --> 07:15.019
Like what?

07:15.185 --> 07:16.495
I don't know.

07:16.620 --> 07:17.796
Maybe there'll be a feel-good ending.

07:17.921 --> 07:19.508
Like all the cats are found safe.

07:19.633 --> 07:21.734
Or sex-butchered by a psychopath.

07:21.900 --> 07:24.126
I guess.

07:25.362 --> 07:26.872
Wow.

07:26.997 --> 07:28.940
"Missing cats turn up
totally unmurdered."

07:29.065 --> 07:30.342
Stop the presses.

07:30.467 --> 07:31.777
It'll keep the story alive.

07:31.902 --> 07:33.445
As soon as it gets dark,

07:33.570 --> 07:36.666
we're releasing those cats.

07:36.832 --> 07:38.316
I don't get it, Wilfred.

07:38.441 --> 07:39.669
If you were really gonna kill them,

07:39.835 --> 07:40.919
why not just do it?

07:41.044 --> 07:42.547
Why keep them in a pit?

07:42.713 --> 07:44.055
Because I'm fattening them up

07:44.180 --> 07:45.300
to make a cat suit out of their fur.

07:45.466 --> 07:46.926
Ooh. What?

07:47.092 --> 07:49.220
- Why?
- Ryan...

07:49.386 --> 07:50.862
Someone needs to show
the cat community

07:50.987 --> 07:53.365
what happens when you go
around scratching dogs.

07:53.490 --> 07:55.834
Plus, imagine how hilarious I'd look

07:55.959 --> 07:57.269
wearing a full-bodied animal suit!

07:57.394 --> 07:58.537
Yeah, well,

07:58.662 --> 08:00.773
that's not gonna happen.

08:00.939 --> 08:02.274
Oh, Ryan, you really
believe that, don't you?

08:02.399 --> 08:03.902
Adorable.

08:10.755 --> 08:12.617
- Hey, Jenna.
- <i>Oh, my God, Ryan</i>.

08:12.742 --> 08:14.037
<i>You won't believe
who just e-mailed me</i>.

08:14.277 --> 08:17.081
Some psychopath who claims
he has the missing cats!

08:17.247 --> 08:17.609
What?

08:17.734 --> 08:20.364
<i>At first I thought it was
some YouTube creep, pranking me,</i>

08:20.489 --> 08:22.420
<i>but then he sent me
a picture of them as proof.</i>

08:22.586 --> 08:23.988
<i>He's for real!</i>

08:25.672 --> 08:27.177
- How about that?
- <i>It gets better</i>.

08:27.302 --> 08:30.735
<i>He's planning to record himself
sex-butchering the cats.</i>

08:30.860 --> 08:33.270
<i>I mean, I feel bad for them,
but he's sending me the video,</i>

08:33.395 --> 08:34.807
<i>and I am going to be the lead story</i>

08:34.972 --> 08:37.809
<i>on every broadcast tomorrow!</i>

08:37.976 --> 08:39.400
<i>And it's all thanks to you.</i>

08:44.558 --> 08:47.207
{pub}Jenna already told her producer
about the cat-killer video.

08:47.559 --> 08:49.828
Her piece is slotted for
tomorrow's broadcast!

08:49.953 --> 08:51.741
- I hope you're happy.
- I am happy.

08:51.907 --> 08:53.032
It's a perfect plan.

08:53.157 --> 08:54.566
Jenna gets her story,

08:54.691 --> 08:56.496
the cats die,
and you get your nuts flicked.

08:56.662 --> 08:57.736
Ow!

08:57.861 --> 08:58.998
What is wrong with you?

08:59.164 --> 09:01.106
There is no cat-killer video!

09:01.231 --> 09:03.742
Jenna's going to be
humiliated all over again,

09:03.867 --> 09:05.964
and this time she'll
give up her dream.

09:06.130 --> 09:07.913
Well, maybe she wouldn't
be so hard on herself

09:08.038 --> 09:09.748
if someone came clean and told her

09:09.873 --> 09:11.636
she's not responsible for
destroying her own career.

09:15.312 --> 09:16.891
We're making the cat-killer
video, aren't we?

09:17.057 --> 09:18.017
We are!

09:19.560 --> 09:21.693
This is just the beginning.

09:21.818 --> 09:23.729
I will not rest

09:23.854 --> 09:26.067
- until every cat in Venice is dead.
- Cut!

09:27.424 --> 09:29.301
Everybody take five.

09:32.114 --> 09:33.605
You know, I'm just not
feeling it, mate.

09:33.730 --> 09:35.074
Um... where are you?

09:35.199 --> 09:36.875
Because you're not here.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.343
This is so stupid.

09:38.468 --> 09:40.164
Can I just say my lines
and get this over with?

09:40.330 --> 09:41.647
This is what I'm talking about, Ryan.

09:41.772 --> 09:42.948
This about who this psychopath is!

09:43.073 --> 09:45.374
Let's just do this.

09:46.628 --> 09:48.464
Everybody set?

09:49.813 --> 09:51.050
And...

09:53.550 --> 09:54.595
... Action!

09:54.851 --> 09:57.181
- This is just the beginning...
- Cut!

09:59.723 --> 10:01.366
Okay, uh...

10:01.491 --> 10:02.701
You've-you've done
the naturalistic shit...

10:02.826 --> 10:04.436
Well, it's not shit, but...

10:04.561 --> 10:06.705
You-you've done that now.
Just for the hell of it,

10:06.830 --> 10:08.240
let's do one really big.

10:08.365 --> 10:10.278
Like, if that was a four,
give me a ten.

10:11.635 --> 10:13.281
And...

10:13.447 --> 10:14.991
Action!

10:15.157 --> 10:16.582
This is just the beginning!

10:16.707 --> 10:18.016
Bigger, please, Ryan!

10:18.141 --> 10:19.585
I will not rest

10:19.710 --> 10:21.748
until every cat in Venice is dead!

10:21.914 --> 10:23.082
Bigger, Ryan.

10:23.313 --> 10:25.126
And then I will move
to my ultimate goal...

10:25.292 --> 10:27.459
- Bigger, mate!
- Of making earrings,

10:27.584 --> 10:30.048
and bronze testicles,

10:30.214 --> 10:31.296
of every postal worker

10:31.421 --> 10:34.010
in the greater Los Angeles area!

10:36.814 --> 10:40.934
And now, let the first
blood be spilled!

10:41.846 --> 10:43.102
Cut.
Whoa!

10:43.268 --> 10:45.777
You don't say "cut." I say "cut."

10:45.902 --> 10:48.066
Unless I say "action,"
and then you... cut.

10:48.232 --> 10:49.781
We're not using real cats for this.

10:49.906 --> 10:51.778
Ryan, this needs to look authentic.

10:51.944 --> 10:54.113
- This'll look fine.
- Okay, do it your way.

10:54.279 --> 10:55.821
Since you can do it

10:55.946 --> 10:57.308
and see it through
the camera at the same time.

10:57.433 --> 10:59.081
What do I know?
I'm just a dickhead in a trucker cap.

10:59.483 --> 11:01.393
I'm not killing any cats...

11:01.518 --> 11:02.997
Goddamned you!

11:03.163 --> 11:05.063
I'm trying to help you here.
You understand that?

11:05.188 --> 11:06.965
I've been a goddamned coordinator!

11:07.090 --> 11:09.701
I'm trying to help you figure
out the goddamned picture.

11:09.826 --> 11:11.403
Okay, bitch?

11:11.528 --> 11:13.341
No need to be goddamned yell at.

11:13.507 --> 11:18.750
We worked on this goddamned
thing for three goddamned hours,

11:18.875 --> 11:22.744
not to be yelled at by some
little runt funny goddamned fool!

11:23.934 --> 11:26.860
I've been trying to help you,
you goddamned bitch!

11:27.658 --> 11:28.978
Figure that yourself!

11:30.774 --> 11:32.424
Goddamn!

11:32.549 --> 11:33.825
You want my help!

11:33.950 --> 11:35.227
You don't want my help!

11:35.352 --> 11:37.029
Wasting everybody's time!

11:37.154 --> 11:38.491
Sorry, everyone!

11:38.657 --> 11:40.399
So they're goddamned gone!

11:40.524 --> 11:43.035
You're goddamned grown-up!

11:43.160 --> 11:45.771
You're not a goddamned baby!

11:45.896 --> 11:47.706
You're a goddamned grown-up.

11:47.831 --> 11:48.918
I'm not a grown-up.

11:49.299 --> 11:51.276
I'm only trying
to goddamned help you!

11:51.401 --> 11:53.645
Did I yell at you?

11:53.770 --> 11:56.515
Did I goddamned yell at you
before right now?!

11:56.640 --> 11:57.616
No.
No!

11:57.741 --> 11:59.345
I didn't goddamned yell at you.

11:59.710 --> 12:01.253
Not before right now.

12:01.378 --> 12:03.555
You goddamned slut!

12:11.321 --> 12:14.357
Fine, shoot it with the stuffed cats.

12:16.393 --> 12:20.572
Ah, you started it without me.

12:20.697 --> 12:22.741
Yeah, I would've waited,

12:22.866 --> 12:26.372
but your e-mail to Jenna promised
we're in time for the new news, so...

12:30.542 --> 12:32.184
Gee, you're a wizard
with that clicker.

12:32.309 --> 12:33.652
It's called a mouse.

12:33.777 --> 12:34.964

12:50.812 --> 12:52.398

12:52.564 --> 12:56.527
If you do say so yourself.

12:58.236 --> 13:01.157
Wow, what a clicking, huh?

13:03.283 --> 13:06.118
Well, yeah, look, I think
I'm just getting away here,

Yeah.

13:21.992 --> 13:23.669

13:23.794 --> 13:26.338

Jenna, I love it.

14:18.281 --> 14:20.058
It's a masterpiece.

14:20.183 --> 14:21.695
It was all a joke.

14:21.952 --> 14:24.863
Stupid little squishy tit's
all for it.

14:24.988 --> 14:26.825
Some journalist I am, huh?

14:26.991 --> 14:29.411
Jenna...

14:29.577 --> 14:30.826
I am done.

14:33.964 --> 14:35.583
You reedit it, the video?!

14:35.799 --> 14:37.669
Why didn't you use any
of the stuff we shot?

14:37.835 --> 14:39.462
You were just too big.

14:39.628 --> 14:40.545
How could you?!

14:40.670 --> 14:42.347
She's gonna quit her job!

14:42.472 --> 14:44.116
She's worked so hard
to get to where she is,

14:44.241 --> 14:45.283
and it's all ruined!

14:45.408 --> 14:47.243
All because of...

14:50.639 --> 14:54.060
All because of me.

14:54.226 --> 14:55.979
You have to tell her
it's not her fault.

14:56.145 --> 14:59.107
She's gonna hate me.

14:59.273 --> 15:00.699
Maybe.

15:00.824 --> 15:02.367
Maybe not.

15:02.492 --> 15:05.670
Honesty has a way of making
things work out for the best.

15:05.946 --> 15:08.742
But... what if it doesn't?

15:08.908 --> 15:12.244
Mate, you weren't honest
with Amanda, and you lost her.

15:12.369 --> 15:15.332
Why not try it another way?

15:18.501 --> 15:21.463
Jenna, wait.

15:21.629 --> 15:23.923
What's wrong?

15:24.147 --> 15:27.058
The day you lost it on the air,

15:27.183 --> 15:30.388
you... you ate
a piece of candy at my house.

15:30.554 --> 15:33.892
Yeah, I was hungry; I skipped lunch.

15:34.058 --> 15:36.186
It was pot candy.

15:36.352 --> 15:37.479
You were stoned.

15:37.645 --> 15:39.105
What?

15:39.271 --> 15:40.672
I'm sorry.

15:40.797 --> 15:43.408
I didn't realize it until it was
too late to warn you.

15:43.533 --> 15:45.744
Jenna, you're a good journalist.

15:45.869 --> 15:46.946
You can't quit.

15:47.112 --> 15:48.406
But I-I passed the drug test.

15:48.572 --> 15:50.916
I switched the urine.

15:51.041 --> 15:52.851
That's why you thought
you were pregnant.

15:52.976 --> 15:54.371
I used Kristen's pee.

15:54.537 --> 15:55.848
Oh, my God.

15:57.547 --> 15:59.167
- That's why Drew and I...
- There's more.

15:59.333 --> 16:00.305
To get your job back,

16:00.430 --> 16:02.179
- I blackmailed your boss.
- Stop! Just stop!

16:02.501 --> 16:04.255
Jenna, I-I swear, never meant to...

16:04.421 --> 16:05.864
No, just stay away from me!

16:05.989 --> 16:08.824
Wilfred, come!

16:12.629 --> 16:15.392
You told me if I was honest,
everything would work out.

16:15.558 --> 16:17.209
I really thought it would, mate.

16:17.334 --> 16:19.778
Honestly.

16:19.903 --> 16:21.153
Wilfred!

16:29.697 --> 16:31.607
{pub}Again, two pieces of candy.

16:31.732 --> 16:33.834
One is harmless, one is drugs.

16:33.959 --> 16:35.128
Can you tell the difference?

16:35.253 --> 16:36.996
Can your children tell
the difference?

16:37.162 --> 16:37.996
<i>Because I couldn't,</i>

16:38.121 --> 16:40.083
<i>and the consequences for me
were devastating.</i>

16:40.249 --> 16:42.043
<i>It nearly cost me everything.</i>

16:42.275 --> 16:45.120
<i>My job, my reputation
and my peace of mind.</i>

16:45.245 --> 16:46.622
<i>Something needs to be done</i>

16:46.747 --> 16:48.091
<i>to prevent this from happening again.</i>

16:48.315 --> 16:51.193
<i>In Venice Beach, I'm Jenna Mueller.</i>

16:51.644 --> 16:53.152
That was a great report.

16:54.454 --> 16:57.016
Jenna will never speak to me again,

16:57.257 --> 16:59.477
but at least something good's
come out of all this.

16:59.643 --> 17:01.536
Time heals all wounds, right?

17:01.661 --> 17:03.739
That's what you
just scratched on my cheek.

17:03.864 --> 17:07.776
Time, love
and a little bacteria cream.

17:09.435 --> 17:10.746
Hey, what are you doing?

17:10.871 --> 17:12.079
I'm returning the cats.

17:12.204 --> 17:13.950
There's no reason to keep them.

17:14.174 --> 17:16.035
Dude, I was literally
just about to kill them.

17:16.201 --> 17:17.412
You're cuddling with that cat.

17:17.578 --> 17:21.249
I'll lulling it
into a false sense of security.

17:22.790 --> 17:23.960
That tickles.

17:24.126 --> 17:26.713
You are naughty.

17:26.878 --> 17:28.664
And you are silly.

17:28.789 --> 17:31.733
Wilfred, it's obvious
that you love them.

17:31.858 --> 17:32.927
Love?

17:33.093 --> 17:34.670
Are you kidding?

17:34.795 --> 17:37.973
Uh, did you not just hear me
call Mrs. Snuggles naughty

17:38.098 --> 17:39.309
and chairman meow silly?

17:41.668 --> 17:44.272
Look! Cheeky cheek
just brought me a mouse.

17:44.438 --> 17:47.066
You're such a hypocrite.

17:47.232 --> 17:49.184
You pushed me to be honest with Jenna

17:49.309 --> 17:51.520
about the worst shit I've ever done,

17:51.645 --> 17:55.590
but you won't admit how you
really feel about these cats?

17:55.715 --> 17:57.744
Ryan, I have a confession to make.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.871
You love the cats.

18:03.707 --> 18:06.091

Hey.

18:15.977 --> 18:16.804
Hey.

18:18.438 --> 18:20.982
Listen...

18:21.107 --> 18:23.285
About this morning,

18:23.410 --> 18:26.731
I can't stop thinking about
all those things you did.

18:26.947 --> 18:29.734
Jenna, I-I did those things
because I cared about you.

18:29.950 --> 18:34.048
I know, but...
The thing is...

18:36.501 --> 18:37.799
It's my fault, too.

18:38.425 --> 18:39.786
I made you care.

18:39.952 --> 18:45.607
God, you're gonna think
I'm a terrible person, but...

18:45.732 --> 18:47.085
I used you.

18:47.251 --> 18:49.678
- What?
- From the day we met,

18:49.803 --> 18:53.341
it was pretty obvious that
you had a crush on me.

18:54.800 --> 18:57.303
I was new here,

18:57.469 --> 19:00.088
and I felt guilty about
leaving Wilfred alone all day,

19:00.213 --> 19:04.102
and you were so sweet and eager to help,
so I liked you...

19:04.268 --> 19:07.062
Jenna, you didn't use me.

19:07.187 --> 19:08.363
We're friends.

19:08.488 --> 19:09.691
Come on, Ryan.

19:09.956 --> 19:12.434
You took care of Wilfred every day.

19:12.559 --> 19:14.336
You picked up my dry cleaning.

19:14.461 --> 19:15.937
You saved my job.

19:16.062 --> 19:18.540
You did everything for me,

19:18.665 --> 19:22.662
and all I did was smile and
flirt and string you along.

19:24.580 --> 19:27.333
I'm so sorry.

19:31.837 --> 19:34.340
Can you ever forgive me?

19:34.581 --> 19:36.676
Hey, I'll do everything else for you.

19:39.486 --> 19:42.164
Oh, uh, I-I saw your report.

19:42.289 --> 19:43.725
It was pretty great.

19:43.891 --> 19:45.400
Thanks.

19:45.525 --> 19:48.804
You know, th-the
response's been amazing.

19:48.929 --> 19:51.006
I even got a call from
the city councilwoman.

19:51.131 --> 19:52.974
She's gonna introduce an ordinance

19:53.099 --> 19:54.876
to clearly label pot candy.

19:55.001 --> 19:57.312
She wants me to be a policy advisor.

19:57.437 --> 19:58.847
Guess this squish is officially dead.

19:58.972 --> 20:00.450
Wow.

20:00.616 --> 20:02.517
Congratulations.

20:02.642 --> 20:05.330
I'm really glad
that everything worked out.

20:05.496 --> 20:08.123
It wouldn't have happened if
you hadn't been honest with me.

20:08.248 --> 20:10.043
You inspired me, Ryan.

20:22.395 --> 20:24.263
That's what friends are for.

20:27.643 --> 20:29.145
{pub}I'm gonna miss you, Popcorn.

20:29.608 --> 20:30.627
Don't forget to get in

20:30.752 --> 20:33.381
at least an hour scratching post
on every day.

20:34.983 --> 20:36.692
And Bootsy, whatever you do,

20:36.817 --> 20:38.895
stay away from that Chinese
restaurant down the street.

20:39.020 --> 20:40.573
You know what they do there.

20:40.739 --> 20:43.910
They overcharge for mediocre food.

20:44.076 --> 20:45.101
Go.

20:45.226 --> 20:46.202
Be free.

20:46.327 --> 20:47.737
You did the right thing, Wilfred.

20:47.862 --> 20:49.290
So hard.

20:51.542 --> 20:52.575
My God!

20:52.700 --> 20:53.643
Dobies?

20:53.768 --> 20:55.213
What, they're real?

20:55.379 --> 20:57.513
Run to the trees!

20:57.638 --> 20:58.581
To the trees!

20:58.706 --> 21:00.850
Run, chairman meow!

21:00.975 --> 21:02.251
Bootsy, no!

21:02.376 --> 21:05.473
No... ho-oh!
