02:07.211 --> 02:09.336
Now here's how tonight works.

02:09.380 --> 02:12.172
Both the bull and skunk
will perform twice.

02:12.216 --> 02:17.052
And for the first time
in "masked singer" history,
one duet.

02:17.096 --> 02:18.053
So that's pretty exciting.

02:18.097 --> 02:20.222
- Wow.
- Yes.

02:20.266 --> 02:24.059
Bull's duet partner is
season three runner-up turtle,

02:26.397 --> 02:28.355

02:28.357 --> 02:32.526
And skunk will be singing
with a "masked singer" newcomer,

02:32.570 --> 02:36.071
grammy award-winning legend
michael bolton.

02:36.115 --> 02:37.156
- Yes!
- Yeah!

02:37.449 --> 02:40.450
- Wow.
- You guys ready to get
this thing going?

02:40.494 --> 02:41.952
Ow!

02:41.996 --> 02:45.664
Give it up for our panel
of celebrity detectives!

02:45.708 --> 02:47.583
Come on!

02:47.626 --> 02:50.085
Robin: Yeah!

02:50.963 --> 02:52.337
- ( ken shouts )
- whoo!

02:52.381 --> 02:54.173
Thank you, nick.
Thank you.

02:54.175 --> 02:55.465
Thank you guys.

02:55.509 --> 02:59.678
Now they're all fighting
for our golden ear trophy,

02:59.722 --> 03:01.305
and, nicole, you got one.

03:01.348 --> 03:04.057
I'm on the board, nick.
I'm coming!

03:04.059 --> 03:06.185
- ( hisses )
- I'm coming, jenny, for you!

03:06.228 --> 03:08.145
You're coming for jenny,
but you're tied with me,

03:08.189 --> 03:10.230
so I don't think
you're gonna win.

03:11.317 --> 03:13.317
Why are you coughing
like it's-- come on.

03:13.360 --> 03:15.027
Because I'm really scared
I'm not gonna win.

03:15.070 --> 03:18.322
- Oh.
- I think there's
a conspiracy going on.

03:18.365 --> 03:21.366
Usually, I mean, ever since
donny was on the show

03:21.410 --> 03:22.492
and you didn't get him right,

03:22.536 --> 03:24.328
you've been going downhill
from there.

03:24.330 --> 03:28.248
- Whoa! Nick.
- You are our double
golden ear champion,

03:28.292 --> 03:30.334
but it's not looking pretty
for you right now.

03:30.336 --> 03:32.878
Ken: Aww.

03:32.922 --> 03:36.965
Now let's get
this group a final started!

03:37.009 --> 03:39.218
We're kicking things off
with the bull.

03:39.261 --> 03:43.013
Robin swears he's never heard
his amazing voice before

03:43.015 --> 03:45.182
and nicole thinks
she knows who it is.

03:45.226 --> 03:46.475
But what do you think?

03:49.146 --> 03:52.022
After years of chasing
my destiny,

03:52.024 --> 03:53.607
<i> I got a big break.</i>

03:54.693 --> 03:56.193
That is a checkered flag.

03:56.237 --> 03:58.278
- Racing flag.
- Yep.

03:58.322 --> 04:02.574
<i> I thought it would change</i>
<i> my life, but instead,</i>

04:02.618 --> 04:04.618
<i> I changed myself...</i>

04:04.662 --> 04:06.995
<i> Because of what people</i>
<i> around me were saying,</i>

04:07.039 --> 04:09.581
<i> which I regretted</i>
<i> for a long time.</i>

04:14.171 --> 04:16.964
<i> But one day,</i>
<i> I woke up and I realized</i>

04:17.007 --> 04:22.761
<i> that the qualities that</i>
<i> I was hiding were actually</i>
<i> what gave me my superpowers.</i>

04:22.805 --> 04:25.931
<i> When I was true to myself,</i>
<i> my success skyrocketed.</i>

04:25.975 --> 04:27.557
- Amen.
- That's right.

04:27.601 --> 04:30.811
<i> And now I have the opportunity</i>
<i> to inspire others</i>

04:30.854 --> 04:34.147
<i> who maybe think that they</i>
<i> don't fit in with their herd.</i>

04:34.191 --> 04:38.610
<i> And as you can see,</i>
<i> I'll never miss the chance</i>
<i> again to express myself.</i>

04:40.281 --> 04:42.990
How do you not root for him
hearing that?

04:43.033 --> 04:44.649
- He has an amazing story.

06:54.456 --> 06:56.540
- Straight up.
- I'm done with you.

06:56.583 --> 06:59.251
The bull is not playing.

06:59.294 --> 07:02.838
This is definitely his ring.
My goodness!

07:02.881 --> 07:07.342
I mean, what an incredible way
to kick off the group a finale

07:07.386 --> 07:11.012
with your best performance,
and the most entertaining

07:11.056 --> 07:13.890
performance we've ever
had on the show.

07:13.892 --> 07:18.478
- For real.
- Mr. Bull, I can't believe

07:18.522 --> 07:20.397
what you're able to do
in that costume.

07:20.399 --> 07:23.525
Can you imagine seeing him
in concert without all that,

07:23.569 --> 07:24.901
what he would do?

07:24.945 --> 07:26.319
Nicole: Yeah!

07:26.363 --> 07:30.365
"masked singer" has never even
played in this league,

07:30.409 --> 07:34.453
- this caliber!
- Nick: Straight up.

07:34.496 --> 07:36.872
All right, this far
along in the competition,

07:36.915 --> 07:40.083
the panelists are
getting closer to working out
who these singers are,

07:40.127 --> 07:44.129
but to make things easier,
we're going to rule out a name

07:44.173 --> 07:47.340
that has been on the tip
of their tongue.

07:47.342 --> 07:49.259
Men in black,
roll out the tongue.

07:49.303 --> 07:52.596
- Robin: Whoa.
- Jenny: Oh, my gosh.
That's awesome.

07:53.891 --> 07:56.391
Oh, my gosh.
That is weird.

07:56.435 --> 07:59.519
All right, let's see what's on
the tip of this tongue.

07:59.563 --> 08:02.856
- Ken: Oh.
- Well, this is what was on
the tip of your tongue.

08:02.900 --> 08:04.483
- See this guy?
- Look at that.

08:04.526 --> 08:07.152
- Jenny: Who is it?
- Is that alexander hamilton?

08:07.196 --> 08:09.029
- Look at you, history!
- Whoa!

08:09.031 --> 08:10.906
So it's not someone
from broadway.

08:10.949 --> 08:12.282
Or not someone from "hamilton."

08:12.284 --> 08:13.450
- nick: From "hamilton."
- oh.

08:13.494 --> 08:15.160
Nick: Bull, help us out.

08:15.204 --> 08:18.121
Well, nick,
I am not alexander hamilton,

08:18.165 --> 08:20.999
nor was in the broadway show.

08:21.043 --> 08:23.376
- Yet.
- Whoa.

08:23.420 --> 08:25.879
I did perform at the same venue

08:25.881 --> 08:28.673
where "hamilton"
had its broadway debut.

08:28.675 --> 08:31.384
- Mm!
- Ken, is that helping?

08:31.428 --> 08:35.138
No, no, no.
I feel like he's trying
to swerve us,

08:35.140 --> 08:37.807
because I swear this
is someone from "hamilton."

08:37.851 --> 08:41.019
- he just said he wasn't.
- But I'm trying to find
a loophole, nick!

08:41.063 --> 08:44.022
- I'm trying to figure it out.
- Maybe it's a load of bull.

08:44.066 --> 08:45.649
- Ken: I mean...
- ( bull chuckles )

08:45.692 --> 08:48.443
- good one, robin.
- Ken: I mean,
I'm honestly thinking

08:48.487 --> 08:51.321
it could be
jesse tyler ferguson

08:51.365 --> 08:54.658
who has been on broadway,
who is a triple threat.

08:54.701 --> 08:57.077
And I was hanging out
with jesse tyler the other day,

08:57.120 --> 08:59.329
and he was doing
that kind of flips on a pool.

08:59.373 --> 09:03.291
- Why?
- Because he invited me, nick!

09:03.335 --> 09:04.918
And I was like,
"whoa! I love this!"

09:04.962 --> 09:06.711
'cause he's a liar.
He's a liar.

09:06.755 --> 09:10.382
And he was playing
"opposites attract"
by paula abdul.

09:10.425 --> 09:14.344
Now where's
my golden ear trophy, hmm?

09:14.346 --> 09:15.971
Right? Huh?

09:16.014 --> 09:17.764
Nick: Jenny, make some sense
out of this, please.

09:17.808 --> 09:20.350
Jenny:
Well, nick, there were
some big lgbtq clues,

09:20.394 --> 09:22.269
and then I saw a racing flag.

09:22.271 --> 09:24.354
He was on "rupaul's drag race"
many times,

09:24.398 --> 09:27.232
and recently on tour--
"wicked."

09:27.276 --> 09:29.651
it could be adam lambert.

09:29.695 --> 09:31.486
Ken: Oh.

09:32.698 --> 09:35.824
Vocally,
definitely a possibility,

09:35.867 --> 09:37.909
however, the list
gets shorter and shorter

09:37.953 --> 09:39.619
- from the acrobatics.
- Nicole: Yeah.

09:39.663 --> 09:42.080
There's a few other
really talented people

09:42.124 --> 09:44.165
that I cannot believe
I have not brought up.

09:44.167 --> 09:46.543
- Okay.
- Someone who stands out
from the herd.

09:46.587 --> 09:49.879
I'm thinking someone
like jaden smith, right?

09:49.881 --> 09:52.924
Or there is a brilliant
broadway superstar

09:52.968 --> 09:54.509
by the name of jeremy pope.

09:54.511 --> 09:56.136
He can dance like that,

09:56.179 --> 09:58.430
he can sing,
he can do everything.

09:58.432 --> 09:59.514
Ken: Good guess.

09:59.516 --> 10:02.017
Nicole, we could beauty
and the beast,

10:02.060 --> 10:03.476
but you playing games.

10:03.478 --> 10:05.645
- Wow.
- Oh!

10:05.689 --> 10:08.231
Bull is flirting with nicole.

10:08.275 --> 10:10.942
We'll be right back
with "the masked flirter"
after this.

10:10.986 --> 10:15.155
- Jenny: Right?
- Nick: Before nicole takes
the bull by the horns,

10:15.198 --> 10:17.157
let's give it up
for that amazing performance.

10:17.200 --> 10:18.283
- Not bad.
- Yeah.

10:18.327 --> 10:20.285
- Incredible.
- Unbelievable.

10:20.329 --> 10:25.915
Now head on backstage
and prep yourself for that
big duet you got coming up.

10:25.959 --> 10:28.126
That was crazy.

10:28.170 --> 10:31.588
Hey, bull, it's your bestie
matthew morrison here.

10:31.632 --> 10:32.631
You know, I just have to say,

10:32.966 --> 10:34.924
it fills my heart with glee
to see you strutting

10:34.968 --> 10:39.346
those beautiful hooves
and that gorgeous voice of yours
on "the masked singer."

10:39.348 --> 10:40.930
now I know you're gonna kill it,

10:40.974 --> 10:43.141
probably gonna make it
all the way to the end,

10:43.185 --> 10:44.351
and that's no bull.

10:44.394 --> 10:45.268
Good luck, my friend.

10:45.479 --> 10:47.395
Nick:<i> Coming up,</i>
<i> for the first time</i>

10:47.439 --> 10:49.022
<i> in "masked singer" history,</i>

10:49.066 --> 10:51.149
<i> musical superstars</i>
<i> join our finalists</i>

10:51.151 --> 10:53.443
<i> for duets you do not</i>
<i> want to miss.</i>

10:53.487 --> 10:54.903
How insane was that?

10:54.946 --> 10:56.488
<i> Only one can make it through,</i>

10:56.531 --> 10:59.357
<i> and you won't believe</i>
<i> who gets unmasked.</i>

10:59.359 --> 11:01.242
Oh, my gosh!

11:09.002 --> 11:11.419
After seeing
bull's performance,

11:11.463 --> 11:15.340
it's certainly raising
the stakes for me.

11:15.384 --> 11:19.219
The skunk has inspired me
to not hold back.

11:19.262 --> 11:23.807
<i>So tonight, I'm gonna crush it,</i>
<i> and I'm trying to win it.</i>

11:23.850 --> 11:27.352
Announcer:
<i> Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i> it's skunk time.</i>

11:29.231 --> 11:31.523
Welcome back
to "the masked singer"

11:31.566 --> 11:33.358
and our group a finals.

11:33.402 --> 11:36.319
It's the bull versus the skunk.

11:36.363 --> 11:39.656
Every celebrated r&b singer
of the last three decades

11:39.700 --> 11:41.908
has been guessed for skunk.

11:41.952 --> 11:46.287
But if you're still not sure,
here's a little more guidance.

11:50.585 --> 11:53.503
Skunk:<i> Throughout my career,</i>
<i>I would say just as many people</i>

11:53.547 --> 11:57.090
<i> have been inspired by</i>
<i> my person as by my music.</i>

11:57.134 --> 11:59.801
- New york.
- New york? Alicia keys.

11:59.803 --> 12:03.263
<i> One time I was at church</i>
<i> with my good friend</i>
<i> whitney houston,</i>

12:03.306 --> 12:08.017
<i> rest in peace,</i>
<i> and there was a young lady,</i>
<i> who was, like, boo-hoo crying.</i>

12:08.061 --> 12:13.273
<i> I'm thinking, "clearly</i>
<i> she's crying 'cause she sees</i>
<i> whitney houston," you know?</i>

12:13.316 --> 12:15.984
<i> And so the lady got up</i>
<i> and she was saying that</i>

12:16.027 --> 12:18.403
<i> my song got her</i>
<i> through so much.</i>

12:18.447 --> 12:21.156
<i> She was literally crying like,</i>
<i> "I know god is real</i>

12:21.199 --> 12:23.158
<i> because I never thought</i>
<i> I'd ever see you in my life."</i>

12:23.201 --> 12:24.784
<i> and then I started crying,</i>

12:24.828 --> 12:27.162
<i> 'cause I'm thinking</i>
<i> she's talking about whitney.</i>

12:27.164 --> 12:28.580
<i> And I was like, "oh, my god."</i>

12:28.623 --> 12:30.331
wow.

12:32.919 --> 12:34.419
<i> It made me realize</i>
<i> that my actions</i>

12:34.463 --> 12:36.421
<i> and the hardships</i>
<i> I've been through</i>

12:36.465 --> 12:40.049
<i> didn't just make me stronger,</i>
<i> they helped other people too,</i>

12:40.093 --> 12:42.135

<i> with me forever.</i>

14:56.897 --> 15:00.982
The skunk with everyone
on their feet

15:01.026 --> 15:03.151
as she dropped to her knees.

15:05.155 --> 15:07.405
Well, mrs. Skunk,

15:07.407 --> 15:09.407
that was absolutely stunning,
gorgeous,

15:09.451 --> 15:12.035
and I really mean it,
you could be our next winner.

15:12.078 --> 15:13.912
Robin: Yes.

15:13.955 --> 15:16.164
- Preach.
- No, you said it.

15:16.166 --> 15:19.292
You dig so much deeper
into your soul when you sing

15:19.336 --> 15:22.003
that we can feel the pain
that you have to go through

15:22.088 --> 15:23.129
- to love a man...
- That's right.

15:23.423 --> 15:27.050
The pain that it takes
to make a relationship work.

15:27.093 --> 15:28.259
- Come on, preach, robin.
- Yes!

15:28.303 --> 15:31.179
- Preach, robin!
Preach, robin!
- Preach!

15:31.222 --> 15:33.389
- That--
- come on, robin.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.475
- Ken: Yes!
- That's what
we're all feeling,

15:35.518 --> 15:36.893
and that performance,
you got on your knees,

15:37.312 --> 15:39.395
you left every single note
that you have in your body
on that stage.

15:39.397 --> 15:41.606
- Thank you.
- Yes, you did.

15:44.361 --> 15:47.654
But we still don't know
who the skunk is!

15:47.697 --> 15:51.115
So which wrong celebrity guess

15:51.159 --> 15:53.618
has been on the tip
of the panel's tongues?

15:53.662 --> 15:56.162
- Roll the tongue out.
- We're about to find out.

15:56.206 --> 15:59.040
Roll out the tongue.

16:00.210 --> 16:02.835
Let's see what's on the tip
of this tongue.

16:02.879 --> 16:04.212
Oh.

16:05.757 --> 16:08.257
- See what I got here?
- Robin: What is that?
Jill scott?

16:08.301 --> 16:11.344
Okay, so it's not jill scott.

16:12.389 --> 16:15.014
However,
we have performed together

16:15.058 --> 16:17.350
a few times in the past.

16:17.394 --> 16:19.185
Oh, really?

16:19.229 --> 16:20.687
Performed with jill scott.
Jenny?

16:20.730 --> 16:23.940
- I need a hot minute, nick.
- I'll come back to you.

16:23.984 --> 16:25.274
I don't need a hot minute.

16:25.276 --> 16:28.152
I don't waste time thinking
and, like, planning.

16:28.196 --> 16:30.238
We know. We know.

16:30.281 --> 16:33.157
I just go off the flab
of my stomach,

16:33.159 --> 16:34.909
and my stomach tells me

16:34.953 --> 16:37.578
that the skunk
is definitely mary j. "bligh."

16:39.457 --> 16:41.958
put the g on the--
when you say "blige."

16:42.002 --> 16:44.961
- huh?
- It's not "bligh."
it's blige.

16:45.005 --> 16:46.754
She's a family friend, nick.

16:46.798 --> 16:50.425
She told me, and I quote,
"ken, I prefer that you,

16:50.468 --> 16:53.386
because we're so close,
that you call me bligh."

16:53.430 --> 16:55.221
I said,
"but nick cannon said--"

16:55.265 --> 16:58.182
- that's a "blie!"
- no, she said blige.

16:58.226 --> 16:59.684
You're "blying" right now.

16:59.728 --> 17:02.353
- How dare you! How dare you!
- You're blying!

17:02.397 --> 17:03.855
You're the biggest
"bliar" I know.

17:03.898 --> 17:06.149
Ken: But you know
what's not a blie?

17:06.192 --> 17:09.068
Is that mary j.
Has been friends with
whitney houston over the years.

17:09.112 --> 17:11.237
I honestly,
in my heart of hearts,

17:11.281 --> 17:15.616
believe and I hope
that this is mary j. Bligh...

17:15.618 --> 17:16.868
- "juh!"
- there you go.

17:16.870 --> 17:18.911
Yep, yep.

17:18.955 --> 17:24.167
Well, our once clue expert
now seems to be a little bit
frustrated with the clues.

17:24.210 --> 17:26.252
I'm very frustrated
with the clues.

17:26.296 --> 17:30.256
Okay, whitney houston
happened to play

17:30.300 --> 17:33.176
the fairy godmother
in "cinderella."

17:33.219 --> 17:36.179
- brandy.
- ( jeering )

17:36.222 --> 17:39.432
I hear you saying no,
but this is all I got, okay?

17:39.434 --> 17:41.768
Jenny, you're
a two-time champion.

17:41.770 --> 17:45.146
- It's okay to be dethroned.
- You need to spread the love.

17:45.190 --> 17:46.314
I thought it was brandy
for a hot second.

17:46.357 --> 17:47.607
Okay.

17:47.942 --> 17:50.860
Brandy definitely has that voice
and has a whitney connection,

17:50.904 --> 17:52.153
'cause when brandy
first came out,

17:52.155 --> 17:54.489
a lot of people dubbed her
as the next whitney

17:54.532 --> 17:56.449
- when she was 14, 15 years old.
- Thanks, robin and nicole.

17:56.493 --> 17:58.910
And I've been back and forth
a little bit, but, you know,

17:58.912 --> 18:02.622
the clues and the story and now
that I see the whitney clue,

18:02.665 --> 18:04.290
and also a lot of you
might know this,

18:04.292 --> 18:07.919
used to be neighbors
with whitney,

18:07.962 --> 18:09.170
is faith evans.

18:12.133 --> 18:14.133
The audience
is on your side, robin.

18:14.135 --> 18:15.885
You know,
I do think it's faith,

18:15.929 --> 18:17.428
but no matter who it is,

18:17.430 --> 18:20.139
how lucky are we
to have you on this season?

18:20.141 --> 18:21.474
- I mean,
we've been so blessed.
- Yeah.

18:21.476 --> 18:23.935
So blessed.

18:23.937 --> 18:28.439
And we just witnessed
one of the best performances
on television.

18:28.483 --> 18:30.775
- Robin: Yeah!
- Great job, skunk.

18:30.819 --> 18:35.780
Now head on backstage,
because you get to perform again
with michael bolton.

18:35.824 --> 18:40.159
So, guys, I mean,
this is insanely competitive.

18:40.161 --> 18:43.162
This might be the closest
competitors we've ever seen.

18:43.206 --> 18:44.872
They're both really strong
in their lanes.

18:44.916 --> 18:48.126
Nicole: Yeah,
the skunk is, like, soulful,
takes us to church,

18:48.128 --> 18:52.255
but then the bull is
the everything entertainer.

18:52.298 --> 18:54.257
This feels like
the season finale...

18:54.300 --> 18:56.217
- It does.
- And it's just group a.

18:56.261 --> 18:59.762
Hey, skunk, judge mathis here.

18:59.764 --> 19:02.348
I see you doing your thing
on "masked singer,"

19:02.392 --> 19:04.892
and I'm sure out
of all those competitors,

19:04.936 --> 19:08.938
nobody will be able to stand up
to the heat you're bringing.

19:08.940 --> 19:10.439
So good luck to you,

19:10.483 --> 19:14.318
and go out there and show them
that your stuff don't stink.

19:16.030 --> 19:17.321
<i> ♪ who is that? </i>

19:20.618 --> 19:22.285
It's me, miss masky.

19:22.328 --> 19:24.662
Before we get to see
bull's dynamic duet,

19:24.664 --> 19:28.291
he left me this far-out clue
that'll have you seeing stars.

19:28.334 --> 19:30.626
Can you figure it out
before it jets away?

19:30.628 --> 19:32.211
Whoo!

19:34.716 --> 19:36.090
<i> ♪ who is that? </i>

19:36.134 --> 19:39.594
Welcome back
to "the masked singer"
group a finals.

19:39.637 --> 19:41.345
Before we go any further,

19:41.389 --> 19:44.307
let's take a look at what
the panel is competing for,

19:44.350 --> 19:48.519
the highly coveted
golden ear trophy.

19:48.563 --> 19:52.106
That's what
they fighting for, y'all,

19:52.150 --> 19:53.566
the golden ear trophy.

19:53.610 --> 19:55.276
Jenny has two at home,

19:55.278 --> 19:59.405
but ken and nicole are in
the lead for this year's trophy.

19:59.449 --> 20:01.532
- Whoa! Jenny!
- Nick: Oh, my goodness.

20:01.576 --> 20:02.867
- Jenny!
- Jenny!

20:02.869 --> 20:04.619
- Ken: Jenny!
- Robin: Poor men in black.

20:04.662 --> 20:06.204
I am so sorry.

20:06.247 --> 20:09.290
- Oh, my goodness.
- Jenny, get ahold of yourself.

20:09.334 --> 20:11.334
- Ken: Oh, my goodness.
- Nick: My goodness.

20:13.630 --> 20:17.465
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

20:17.508 --> 20:20.134
Hey, more importantly,
is the trophy okay?

20:20.136 --> 20:22.678
Put it down, ken.

20:22.680 --> 20:25.473
And now let's get back
to our group a finals.

20:25.516 --> 20:28.017
The bull and the skunk are
getting mic-ed up backstage,

20:28.019 --> 20:29.977
preparing for
their show-stopping duets.

20:30.021 --> 20:33.648
How does our bovine contender
feel about his journey so far...

20:33.691 --> 20:35.191
Yeah!

20:35.235 --> 20:36.150
...As he prepares
for his collaboration

20:36.402 --> 20:39.320
with "masked singer" alum
jesse mccartney?

20:39.364 --> 20:42.198
- Whoo!
- Let's find out.

20:45.119 --> 20:47.119
Crowd:
Bull! Bull! Bull! Bull!

20:47.163 --> 20:50.331
The fact I'm so close
to the end of this competition,

20:50.375 --> 20:52.208
it's just mind-boggling to me.

20:52.252 --> 20:56.629
<i> I'm a person who's never</i>
<i> really believed in my voice,</i>

20:56.631 --> 20:58.714
<i> and I'm gonna be honest,</i>

20:58.758 --> 21:02.843
<i> when I first saw the bull,</i>
<i> I was not 100% sold on it.</i>

21:02.887 --> 21:07.139

did venus blow your mind? ♪

21:11.020 --> 21:13.145

Are you nervous?

21:13.189 --> 21:16.190
Every single time.

21:16.234 --> 21:17.817
- Wow.
- Wow.

21:18.236 --> 21:22.196
<i> But with every round,</i>
<i> I discovered what I had</i>
<i> in common with the bull.</i>

21:22.240 --> 21:25.157
<i> I am tough, I'm a romantic,</i>

21:25.201 --> 21:26.575
<i> I'm a fighter.</i>

21:35.920 --> 21:39.005
This week, I've been learning

21:39.048 --> 21:40.631
<i> jesse mccartney.</i>

21:40.675 --> 21:41.924
My first impression of bull

21:41.968 --> 21:44.135
was this guy can really,
really sing.

21:44.137 --> 21:45.886
<i> I really have no idea</i>
<i> who this guy is,</i>

21:45.930 --> 21:49.849
<i> so here I am rehearsing for</i>
<i>a duet with an unknown partner.</i>

21:49.892 --> 21:51.267
But, hey,
I'm up for the challenge,

21:51.311 --> 21:53.352
and from what I've seen,
so is the bull.

21:53.396 --> 21:57.940
- I'm, like, whop, bop.
It's very extra.
- Okay.

21:57.984 --> 22:00.151
They ain't ready for it.

22:00.194 --> 22:04.238

24:29.010 --> 24:30.259
Great job.

24:33.681 --> 24:35.264
What's up, guys?

24:36.601 --> 24:38.142
Such an amazing performance,

24:38.144 --> 24:41.020
the bull and the one and only
jesse mccartney.

24:41.063 --> 24:43.481
- Jesse!
- Jesse!

24:43.524 --> 24:44.607
Wow.

24:44.609 --> 24:46.025
Oh, my goodness.

24:46.068 --> 24:49.153
I was just telling jenny
how much I love this so much.

24:49.197 --> 24:52.656
Bull, phenomenal as always,
and, jesse, it is so good

24:52.700 --> 24:54.700
- to have you back on
"the masked singer."
- good to see you, ken!

24:54.744 --> 25:00.039
Literally, this made my day
to see you and to see
you two together.

25:00.082 --> 25:01.499
This is, like,
just nothing but smiling.

25:01.542 --> 25:05.252
- Love this guy.
- Yeah, bull,
you always crush it,

25:05.296 --> 25:07.379
and, jesse,
we loved you as the turtle,

25:07.423 --> 25:09.673
but that handsome smile
and that voice.

25:09.717 --> 25:12.510
- I mean, come on.
- So good to see you guys.

25:12.512 --> 25:16.305
This entire experience
feels like coming back
to an old family.

25:16.307 --> 25:18.599
I'm just so happy that I could
say I was a part of it.

25:18.601 --> 25:20.476
- I love it.
- You're family!

25:20.520 --> 25:23.020
I mean, he's amazing. I think
he's gonna go all the way.

25:23.064 --> 25:25.272
Ken: Wow.

25:25.316 --> 25:27.358
You know, coming off the show,
I have a lot of empathy.

25:27.401 --> 25:30.027
You know, with the costume,
I know how hard it is.

25:30.071 --> 25:32.988
This even looks heavier than
the turtle outfit to move.

25:33.032 --> 25:35.699
And I know that you're doing
splits and everything,

25:35.743 --> 25:40.162
like, I can't even imagine,
you know? So kudos to you.

25:40.164 --> 25:42.331
Maybe I'll make a robin thicke
dad joke in this moment.

25:42.375 --> 25:43.374
Go for it.

25:43.417 --> 25:45.251
So I don't know
who this bull is,

25:45.294 --> 25:46.877
but it ain't his first rodeo.

25:46.879 --> 25:48.504
- Oh!
- Ay!

25:48.548 --> 25:50.214
- Yeah!
- Robin, you can have that one.

25:50.258 --> 25:51.590
Nicole: That's right.

25:51.968 --> 25:55.469
All right, thank you so much.
Ladies and gentlemen,
jesse mccartney.

25:55.513 --> 25:57.346
Thank you, guys.

25:58.474 --> 25:59.890
Jesse!

25:59.892 --> 26:02.226
- And of course, the bull!
- Bull!

26:02.270 --> 26:03.852
You guys can head on backstage.

26:03.896 --> 26:07.106
Help him out!
Bull, await your fate,

26:07.149 --> 26:09.358
'cause it's almost time
for the big vote.

26:10.945 --> 26:15.447
Singing duet
with the jesse mccartney,
it was so much fun.

26:15.491 --> 26:18.993
I'm hoping that singing with
the turtle may be good luck.

first stop, "masked singer."

31:19.461 --> 31:22.880
second stop will be
skunk/michael bolton tour,

31:22.923 --> 31:25.215
- and we're gonna be
there front row.
- We'll be there.

31:25.217 --> 31:27.885

- Okay, you said it.

31:46.030 --> 31:47.988
- Thank you. Likewise.
- Thanks for having me.

31:48.032 --> 31:51.033
- It's an honor.
- One of the things she did say

31:51.076 --> 31:54.620
is that this probably
isn't your first time
performing together.

31:54.622 --> 31:56.288
- Oh.
- In the package, she said it,
if you were listening.

31:56.707 --> 31:59.416
- Oh, she said in the package.
- You wasn't paying attention
to the package, ken?

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

32:11.263 --> 32:13.847
So do you have any idea
who this could possibly be?

32:13.891 --> 32:17.976
- I got zip. Zilch.
- Zip and zilch, indeed.

32:18.020 --> 32:20.020
We're gonna find out sooner
or later, right, y'all?

32:20.064 --> 32:24.232
Ladies and gentlemen,
one more time for the skunk

32:24.276 --> 32:27.486
and the one and only
michael bolton.

32:27.529 --> 32:30.238
Thank you for being a part
of our group a finals.

32:30.282 --> 32:33.367
And, of course, the skunk
ripped it down once again.

32:35.204 --> 32:37.162
We'll see the skunk
for the next big vote.

32:37.164 --> 32:40.123
- Skunk! Skunk! Skunk!
- I absolutely enjoyed

32:40.167 --> 32:41.041
performing
with michael bolton.

32:41.335 --> 32:43.293
<i> The first time</i>
<i> we performed together</i>

32:43.337 --> 32:44.753
<i> was actually at a party,</i>

32:44.797 --> 32:47.297
<i> and I'm not even sure</i>
<i> if he remembers that night.</i>

32:47.341 --> 32:50.258
He kept saying,
"I wish I knew who you were."

32:53.389 --> 32:54.471
<i> ♪ who is that? </i>

32:58.477 --> 33:02.354
Welcome back
to "the masked singer"
group a finals.

33:02.398 --> 33:06.233
I'm here with the bull
and the skunk.

33:06.276 --> 33:07.693
Whoo!

33:07.736 --> 33:10.028
They've done all they can
and left it all on the stage

33:10.072 --> 33:11.279
with their celebrity duets,

33:11.365 --> 33:14.950
but now someone's journey
will come to an end.

33:14.994 --> 33:18.161
Nerve-wracking.
I'm legit nervous.

33:18.205 --> 33:20.205
It's time
for the audience, panel,

33:20.249 --> 33:23.000
and our super fans
across america

33:23.002 --> 33:25.127
to vote for their favorite.

33:25.129 --> 33:28.338
- Whoo!
-<i> ( fanfare playing )</i>

33:35.597 --> 33:38.015
I'm so nervous, ken.

33:38.058 --> 33:42.144
Only one can advance
to the finale,

33:42.146 --> 33:44.813
and the other has to unmask.

33:44.815 --> 33:47.858
Jenny: I hate that we have
to say goodbye to somebody.

33:47.901 --> 33:50.777
The results are in.

33:50.821 --> 33:54.573
In one of the closest votes
in "masked singer" history...

33:54.616 --> 33:56.616
- Wow.
- What?

33:56.660 --> 33:59.327
The winner of group a is...

33:59.371 --> 34:00.620
- Uh-oh.
- Oh!

34:00.664 --> 34:03.373
<i> ( dramatic music playing )</i>

34:08.672 --> 34:12.132
it's so hard!
Oh, it's gonna be hard!
It's gonna be hard!

34:12.176 --> 34:13.467
It's gonna be hard!

34:16.346 --> 34:19.181
The bull!

34:21.310 --> 34:24.144
- Congratulations.
- Wow, wow!

34:24.146 --> 34:26.354
We'll see you in our finale

34:26.398 --> 34:29.858
taking on queen of hearts
or banana split.

34:29.902 --> 34:35.906
- How do you feel?
- Uh, there are no words
to describe this.

34:35.908 --> 34:38.742
I haven't really
believed in myself that much
in this competition,

34:38.786 --> 34:41.912
but now I know
I've got what it takes
to make it to the end,

34:41.955 --> 34:44.581
and I'm so stoked.

34:44.625 --> 34:47.125
Nick: Now go ahead
and give skunk some love.

34:47.127 --> 34:50.128
- We love you, skunk!
- Now hit the lair.

34:50.130 --> 34:52.547
The finals are gonna be
off the chain.

34:52.591 --> 34:55.926
We gotta keep it going
for skunk.

34:55.969 --> 34:58.053
We hate to see you go,

34:58.097 --> 35:00.806
but we love that we finally
get to see who you are!

35:00.849 --> 35:02.557
Whoo!

35:03.018 --> 35:06.353
However, we must find out what
our panel's first impression
guesses are first though.

35:06.396 --> 35:10.148
- Oh! Oh, snap.
- No, let's skip that today.

35:10.150 --> 35:13.235
No, we're not gonna skip it.
Men in black, bring them out.

35:17.741 --> 35:22.452
Now a reminder, nicole and ken
are tied with one point each.

35:22.496 --> 35:25.372
So this golden ear trophy
could be either one of yours.

35:25.415 --> 35:27.290
Let's see what we got over here.

35:27.334 --> 35:31.086
Ken, your first impression
guess was anita baker.

35:31.130 --> 35:32.420
Robin: Okay.

35:32.464 --> 35:33.922
Nick: Are you sticking
with that?

35:33.966 --> 35:35.924
You know, no.

35:35.968 --> 35:38.885
With tonight's
whitney houston story,

35:38.929 --> 35:42.430
I really think
this is mary j. Blige,

35:42.432 --> 35:44.432
and that's how
you pronounce it, nick.

35:44.434 --> 35:46.351
I've been correcting you
all day.

35:46.395 --> 35:50.438
- I bet you have.
- Ugh! It's blige.

35:50.482 --> 35:53.183
All right, now, jenny,
you were once our clue expert.

35:53.185 --> 35:56.903
You said gloria gaynor
and roberta flack.

35:56.947 --> 35:59.322
- Robin: And?
- Nicole: Uh-oh.

35:59.366 --> 36:01.616
- There's two people in there.
- That's what I'm saying.

36:01.660 --> 36:04.286
It's "guess" not "guesses."

36:04.329 --> 36:07.205
when I really don't know,
I just do "all of the above."

36:07.249 --> 36:10.667
- wow. That's amazing.
- Well, I mean, the skunk
has an enormous tail.

36:10.711 --> 36:13.086
Maybe gloria gaynor's
back there somewhere.

36:13.130 --> 36:15.463
So, clearly,
you can't have both.

36:15.507 --> 36:17.757
You know, weeks ago,

36:17.801 --> 36:20.886
the brilliant will.I.Am
had mentioned mary j. Blige.

36:20.888 --> 36:23.430
And I thought that sounds right.

36:23.473 --> 36:24.764
Even though ken
just said the same thing

36:24.808 --> 36:25.599
and I'm kind of
copying off of him,

36:25.851 --> 36:28.935
I'm going to go
with mary j. Blige.

36:28.979 --> 36:30.562
Ken: Good guess.
Good guess, jenny.

36:30.606 --> 36:34.149
- Thanks, ken! Pow.
- Nick: Now, nicole,

36:34.193 --> 36:37.694
I guess not following the rules
is quite contagious.

36:37.738 --> 36:41.281
- Yes! Sisters!
That's what we are.
- Ken: Nicole.

36:41.325 --> 36:44.075
- Did I do the same thing?
- You believed it to be

36:44.119 --> 36:47.662
deborah cox, fantasia,
and mary j. Blige.

36:47.664 --> 36:51.541
- Three? Oh, my god.
That's hilarious.
- Come on, man!

36:51.585 --> 36:52.918
- What is going on
around here?
- Come on, man!

36:52.961 --> 36:54.586
- I'm open.
- So are you sticking

36:54.630 --> 36:56.421
with any of those guesses?

36:56.465 --> 36:59.090
I am not, actually.

36:59.134 --> 37:00.383
After that whitney story,

37:00.427 --> 37:03.253
I am checking
into that heartbreak hotel.

37:03.255 --> 37:05.096
This is faith evans!

37:05.140 --> 37:09.267
All right.
She said it with confidence.

37:09.311 --> 37:12.062
- Faith evans!
- Mr. Robin thicke.

37:12.105 --> 37:14.898
Who's 0 for everything
so far this season.

37:14.942 --> 37:16.942
- But we love you.
- Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

37:16.985 --> 37:20.153
His first impression guess,
faith evans.

37:20.155 --> 37:22.864
Jenny:
'ey! I like it.

37:22.908 --> 37:24.407
Robin:
Well, you know, like I said,

37:24.451 --> 37:26.993
all the clues that we've seen,
new york city,

37:27.037 --> 37:29.037
we've seen her tell
a heartbreaking tale

37:29.081 --> 37:30.455
of not getting to say goodbye

37:30.499 --> 37:33.458
to somebody who passed
in her life many years ago.

37:33.502 --> 37:35.252
I believe that the person
that she didn't get

37:35.295 --> 37:38.838
to say goodbye to
was the notorious b.I.G.

37:38.882 --> 37:40.257
I just love her,
I love the voice,

37:40.259 --> 37:42.425
and I really do hope
that this is faith evans.

37:42.469 --> 37:44.636
- Nicole: Yes!
- Well done, robin.

37:44.680 --> 37:46.930
- That's amazing.
- Well done. Well said.

37:46.974 --> 37:49.224
Panel, you have made
your final guesses,

37:49.268 --> 37:51.810
and we'll see
if any of you are correct.

37:51.853 --> 37:55.355
Skunk, it's time to show
your famous face.

37:55.357 --> 37:56.648
Whoo!

37:56.692 --> 37:57.607
Audience, say it with me.

39:06.178 --> 39:09.262
- Such a pleasure and honor...
- Thank you.

39:09.264 --> 39:11.514
...To have the icon
in the building.

39:11.558 --> 39:13.141
- Wow!
- Ken: Yes!

39:13.185 --> 39:16.186
- Thank you, guys.
- So beautiful.

39:16.188 --> 39:18.271
- Nick: My goodness.
- Hey, hey.

39:18.273 --> 39:20.148
Singing the roof
off of this place.

39:20.192 --> 39:24.152
Wow, the skunk--
this is a lot of work.

39:24.196 --> 39:27.322
However, it was so much fun.

39:27.366 --> 39:29.741
Man, you blessed us
with each and every performance.

39:29.785 --> 39:32.077
- I mean, panel,
let's talk to y'all.
- Thank you.

39:32.079 --> 39:34.412
- But we gotta start with
the man who got on...
- Let's go, robin!

39:34.456 --> 39:36.998
...The board with
his first impression guess!

39:37.042 --> 39:39.334
- Yeah, I got one right!
- Yeah!

39:39.378 --> 39:41.503
- You knew it.
- Thank you.

39:41.546 --> 39:43.338
Honestly, you know
how I feel about you, faith.

39:43.382 --> 39:47.050
Every time I see you out,
there's just nothing
but outpouring love

39:47.094 --> 39:48.426
and appreciation
and gratitude.

39:48.428 --> 39:50.845
I love you.
You know I love you.

39:50.889 --> 39:51.930
Robin: So there's
nothing else, really.

39:51.973 --> 39:53.973
I've said it every time
she sang.

39:54.017 --> 39:55.850
The goosebumps,
the soul, the passion,

39:55.894 --> 39:58.353
you are and will always be
one my favorite singers ever,

39:58.397 --> 40:01.022
- so thank you.
- Thank you, robin.

40:01.066 --> 40:04.943
We are privileged and honored
to have you here,

40:04.945 --> 40:09.989
and we know that
you took some time off
to take care of your family,

40:09.991 --> 40:12.033
so how does it feel
to be back onstage?

40:12.077 --> 40:15.203
Um, it feels good.
It feels like I never left.

40:15.247 --> 40:16.955
Like,
"this what I do.
What you mean?"

40:16.998 --> 40:20.708
it feels like I came back
with about 20 extra
pounds on my back.

40:20.752 --> 40:24.796
But my son ryder, he's 14,
he's on the autism spectrum.

40:24.840 --> 40:28.341
So we've been
kind of home-schooling him
for three years.

40:28.385 --> 40:32.053
So I really
haven't done nothing except
for be a mom to him.

40:32.097 --> 40:36.182
- Wow.
- So this was my first time
actually saying,

40:36.226 --> 40:38.143
"okay, I'm gonna actually
do something."

40:38.145 --> 40:39.436
- robin: Yes.
- Nick: Yes.

40:39.771 --> 40:43.231
I reminded myself
that when it's time to do
what I gotta do,

40:43.275 --> 40:45.400
I gotta make it do what it do.

40:45.402 --> 40:47.944
- Yes! Yes!
- Come on now. Come on now.

40:47.988 --> 40:49.404
When it's time to do
what I gotta do,

40:49.406 --> 40:51.322
both: I gotta make it
do what it do!

40:51.366 --> 40:52.615
Nick: I love it.

40:52.951 --> 40:55.994
Nicole:
If you don't mind me asking,
in the package you said

40:56.037 --> 40:58.455
that you didn't get to speak
to someone at a party.

40:58.498 --> 41:00.123
What was that story?

41:00.167 --> 41:02.333
That was the night
that my ex-husband

41:02.377 --> 41:05.336
<i> the late great</i>
<i> christopher wallace</i>
<i> passed away.</i>

41:05.380 --> 41:09.257
<i> We were at the same party,</i>
<i> and we were separated</i>
<i> at the time,</i>

41:09.301 --> 41:11.551
and, you know,
just kind of being immature.

41:11.595 --> 41:14.637
And, you know, I knew that
we were supposed to go
to an afterparty,

41:14.681 --> 41:17.015
so I'm like, "well,
I'll speak to him then."

41:17.058 --> 41:19.934
and on the way to that party
is when I got news

41:19.978 --> 41:21.352
that I should
go to the hospital

41:21.396 --> 41:23.271
because something
happened to him.

41:23.273 --> 41:27.734
And we truly appreciate
you sharing that story...

41:27.777 --> 41:30.653
- Yes.
- ...Your passion, your pain,
and your heart with us.

41:30.697 --> 41:34.657
Thank you to everybody
who has just been
a skunk supporter.

41:34.701 --> 41:37.076
I appreciate it.

41:37.120 --> 41:39.412
And to the panel,
thank you guys so much

41:39.456 --> 41:41.164
for the great compliments,
you know?

41:41.166 --> 41:42.916
You make a girl feel good,
you know what I'm saying?

41:42.959 --> 41:45.084
- Nick: Real talk!
- Yeah.

41:45.128 --> 41:47.921
We gotta say, give it up
for the mom, the icon,
the legendary singer,

41:47.964 --> 41:50.632
the one and only faith evans.

41:50.675 --> 41:52.592
Great job. So great.

41:52.636 --> 41:55.011
Next week,
it's the group b finals.

41:55.055 --> 41:58.139
It's banana split
versus queen of hearts.

41:58.141 --> 42:00.892
Who will end up in our finale
against the bull?

42:00.936 --> 42:03.102
You do not want to miss this.

42:03.146 --> 42:05.605
Now you ready to do
what it do?

42:05.607 --> 42:07.023
