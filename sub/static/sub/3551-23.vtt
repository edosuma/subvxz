WEBVTT

00:00.701 --> 00:02.133
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.133 --> 00:05.036
SUSAN'S DREAM CAME TRUE.

00:05.036 --> 00:08.039
HERE. MOVE BACK IN
WITH YOUR FAMILY.
 (chuckles)

00:08.039 --> 00:12.183
BREE HAD TO PUT HER DESIRE
ON HOLD.

00:12.183 --> 00:14.014
JUST TILL MY DIVORCE
GOES THROUGH.

00:14.014 --> 00:16.015
I THINK
THAT'S VERY ADMIRABLE.

00:16.015 --> 00:19.450
TOM AND LYNETTE'S WEEKEND AWAY
MADE THINGS WORSE.

00:19.450 --> 00:22.193
DO YOU THINK
WE'RE IN TROUBLE?
 WHAT DO YOU THINK?

00:22.193 --> 00:25.096
GABY VISITED THE TOWN
WHERE SHE WAS BORN.

00:25.096 --> 00:26.657
THE OLD PLACE
HASN'T CHANGED A BIT.

00:26.657 --> 00:29.200
STOP!
 AND TO HER SURPRISE...

00:29.200 --> 00:31.302
GO CLOSER.
 (taps key)

00:31.302 --> 00:33.364
HER STEPFATHER
FOLLOWED HER HOME.

00:33.364 --> 00:35.366
HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE DEAD.

00:39.110 --> 00:41.612
(Mary Alice)
ONE CLEAR, MOONLIT EVENING,

00:41.612 --> 00:45.045
THERE WAS A DINNER PARTY
ON WISTERIA LANE,

00:45.045 --> 00:50.121
AND EVERYONE WOULD AGREE THAT
IT WAS A NIGHT TO REMEMBER.

00:51.622 --> 00:55.086
THEY WOULD REMEMBER
THE CRISP CHARDONNAY...

00:57.128 --> 00:59.830
THE TANGY SALAD...

00:59.830 --> 01:03.534
AND THE SAVORY CHICKEN.

01:04.765 --> 01:09.840
BUT THE MOST MEMORABLE PART
OF THE EVENING...

01:14.305 --> 01:18.109
WASN'T THE FOOD.

01:35.626 --> 01:38.129
IN THE YEAR
SINCE SHE HAD LEFT THE LANE,

01:38.129 --> 01:41.472
SUSAN DELFINO HAD MISSED
MANY THINGS...

01:41.472 --> 01:45.706
THE LAUGHTER
OF HAPPY CHILDREN...

01:45.706 --> 01:50.181
THE SMILE
OF THE CHEERFUL MAILMAN...

01:51.842 --> 01:55.546
THE SMELL OF WISTERIA IN BLOOM.

01:55.546 --> 01:57.518
AH-CHOO!

01:57.518 --> 02:01.352
BUT WHAT SUSAN MISSED
THE MOST...

02:01.352 --> 02:05.296
WERE HER FRIENDS.

02:05.296 --> 02:07.328
DISHES ARE DONE.
CAN I GO NOW?

02:07.328 --> 02:09.330
WE JUST STARTED UNPACKING.

02:09.330 --> 02:11.332
OH, COME ON.
 IT'S BEEN A WHOLE YEAR

02:11.332 --> 02:13.834
SINCE I COULD WALK OUTSIDE,
KNOCK ON A DOOR,

02:13.834 --> 02:16.607
AND HANG WITH THE GIRLS.
 CAN WE AT LEAST FINISH
THE KITCHEN?

02:16.607 --> 02:20.211
(sighs) FINE.

02:22.743 --> 02:24.245
(thud)

02:24.245 --> 02:26.247
(loud clatter)

02:29.180 --> 02:30.651
(closes drawer)

02:30.651 --> 02:32.653
SUSAN.

02:32.653 --> 02:35.626
GO PLAY WITH YOUR FRIENDS.

02:35.626 --> 02:37.788
YAY! (giggles)

02:37.788 --> 02:39.830
JUST... BE HOME BY DINNER.

02:41.762 --> 02:43.264
(squeals and grunts)

02:43.264 --> 02:45.266
(Chuck) WOW.
 I WIN. HA!

02:45.266 --> 02:46.367
WHOO!

02:46.367 --> 02:48.839
YOU... ARE IN GREAT SHAPE.
(panting)

02:48.839 --> 02:52.773
DID IT EVER OCCUR TO YOU THAT
A MERE WOMAN COULD OUTRACE YOU?

02:52.773 --> 02:55.776
DID IT EVER OCCUR TO YOU
THAT I'D RATHER RUN BEHIND YOU

02:55.776 --> 02:57.808
THAN IN FRONT OF YOU?

02:57.808 --> 03:01.282
THAT... IS SO... SWEET.

03:01.282 --> 03:03.454
(both panting)

03:03.454 --> 03:06.717
(moaning)

03:06.717 --> 03:09.520
(giggles)

03:09.520 --> 03:13.224
(both moaning)

03:13.224 --> 03:15.526
OHH. I HAVE TO TAKE
A SHOWER.

03:15.526 --> 03:17.598
WHAT A COINCIDENCE.
ME, TOO.

03:17.598 --> 03:19.770
REALLY?

03:19.770 --> 03:21.602
WE'RE DOING THIS?

03:21.602 --> 03:24.935
I THOUGHT WE COULDN'T HAVE SEX
UNTIL YOUR DIVORCE WAS FINAL.
 YEAH, I KNOW,

03:24.935 --> 03:27.608
BUT I THOUGHT ABOUT IT A LOT
THESE LAST 40 SECONDS,

03:27.608 --> 03:30.210
AND I THINK I'M DONE WAITING.
 (doorbell rings)

03:30.210 --> 03:31.512
OOH! UGH!

03:31.512 --> 03:34.785
HEY! CAN YOU SPARE A CUP
OF COFFEE FOR A NEW NEIGHBOR?

03:34.785 --> 03:38.619
SUSAN! I JUST FINISHED A RUN,
BUT TOMORROW, FOR SURE.

03:40.951 --> 03:43.794
I'LL RACE YOU TO THE SHOWER.
WHOO!

03:43.794 --> 03:46.327
WAIT.

03:46.327 --> 03:47.758
WAIT? WHAT?

03:47.758 --> 03:50.631
I THINK THERE'S A REASON WHY
GOD SENT SOMEONE TO THE DOOR

03:50.631 --> 03:51.932
THAT EXACT MOMENT.

03:51.932 --> 03:54.535
I DON'T, AND I KNOW HIM
A LOT BETTER THAN YOU DO.

03:54.535 --> 03:56.537
HEY,
I DON'T WANNA WAIT EITHER.

03:56.537 --> 03:59.810
I'M JUST SO CLOSE TO GETTING
OUT OF MY MARRIAGE.
 HOW CLOSE?

03:59.810 --> 04:01.742
DOREEN AND I MEET
WITH THE LAWYERS TOMORROW.

04:01.742 --> 04:04.745
NOW AS LONG AS SHE SHOWS UP
IN A GOOD MOOD,

04:04.745 --> 04:06.677
WE COULD WRAP IT UP
IN NO TIME.

04:06.677 --> 04:10.281
SO OUR SEX LIFE IS DEPENDENT
ON YOUR WIFE'S MOOD?

04:10.281 --> 04:12.583
HER LITTLE BOUTIQUE
ISN'T DOING SO GREAT,

04:12.583 --> 04:15.286
AND THE WORSE BUSINESS IS,
THE CRANKIER SHE GETS.

04:15.286 --> 04:17.827
CRANKIER SHE GETS,
THE MORE SHE DRAGS THIS OUT.

04:17.827 --> 04:21.632
ALL RIGHT, THEN I GUESS
WE'LL BE SHOWERING SEPARATELY.

04:21.632 --> 04:24.765
YOU GO FIRST. JUST DON'T USE
ALL THE HOT WATER.

04:24.765 --> 04:29.440
DON'T WORRY.
I WON'T BE USING ANY.

04:33.874 --> 04:36.747
SO... (sighs) THE KIDS
ARE GONNA WANT DINNER.

04:36.747 --> 04:38.449
(unzipping bag)

04:38.449 --> 04:40.781
SHOULD WE JUST ORDER PIZZA?

04:40.781 --> 04:42.483
FINE.

04:45.956 --> 04:48.659
YOU WANT ME
TO UNPACK FOR YOU?

04:48.659 --> 04:52.723
NO, THAT'S OKAY.
JUST... LEAVE IT.

04:52.723 --> 04:54.925
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

04:57.668 --> 04:59.900
NEVER MIND.

05:02.403 --> 05:04.405
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "NEVER MIND"?

05:04.405 --> 05:06.677
WHY ARE YOU KEEPING
YOUR SUITCASE PACKED?

05:06.677 --> 05:09.480
THE--THE COMPANY HAS
AN APARTMENT NEAR THE OFFICE.

05:11.512 --> 05:14.685
I THINK I SHOULD MOVE IN THERE
FOR A WHILE.

05:14.685 --> 05:16.387
NO. NO. TOM--

05:16.387 --> 05:19.550
YOU DON'T THINK SOME TIME APART
WOULD DO US GOOD?

05:19.550 --> 05:22.553
TIME APART? COME ON. WE BOTH
KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS. IT MEANS

05:22.553 --> 05:26.326
IF YOU WALK OUT THAT DOOR,
YOU'LL NEVER COME BACK IN.
 YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

05:26.326 --> 05:29.329
WE JUST HAD A 3-HOUR CAR RIDE
AND DIDN'T SAY A SINGLE WORD.

05:29.329 --> 05:30.861
I DO KNOW THAT.

05:30.861 --> 05:32.563
(knock on door)

05:35.866 --> 05:38.439
(gasps) GUESS WHO JUST
MOVED BACK ON THE LANE!

05:38.439 --> 05:40.441
OH! OH, MY GOSH!
THAT'S SO GREAT!

05:40.441 --> 05:42.443
I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU!

05:42.443 --> 05:45.446
I'M JUST RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE
OF SOMETHIN', BUT I--

05:45.446 --> 05:47.748
I'M GONNA CALL YOU,
ALL RIGHT? YAY!

05:53.484 --> 05:55.486
SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

05:55.486 --> 05:57.988
YOU'RE DONE
TRYING TO WORK THINGS OUT.

05:57.988 --> 06:00.060
WE'VE BEEN TRYING.

06:00.060 --> 06:01.562
WE CAN'T GIVE UP.

06:01.562 --> 06:03.564
WE HAVE TO KEEP FIGHTING
FOR THIS--

06:03.564 --> 06:05.796
FIGHTING TO SAVE
OUR FAMILY.

06:05.796 --> 06:08.799
ARE WE FIGHTING TO SAVE IT,
OR ARE WE JUST FIGHTING?

06:08.799 --> 06:10.801
IT HAPPENS.
THAT JUST HA--

06:10.801 --> 06:12.703
LYNETTE.

06:12.703 --> 06:15.506
LEAVE THE SUITCASE
WHERE IT IS.

06:40.571 --> 06:41.772
(knock on door)

06:41.772 --> 06:43.003
(gasps)

06:43.003 --> 06:44.675
HEY! GABY!

06:46.907 --> 06:48.639
(sighs)

06:48.639 --> 06:50.641
HI, NEIGHBOR.
INVITE ME IN FOR WINE

06:50.641 --> 06:53.544
SO I CAN GET OUT
OF UNPACKING.

06:53.544 --> 06:56.747
SUSAN, HI. I WAS JUST
ABOUT TO GO OUT. RAIN CHECK?

07:08.599 --> 07:10.601
(door closes)

07:10.601 --> 07:12.603
HEY. WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?

07:12.603 --> 07:13.764
(sighs)

07:13.764 --> 07:16.106
THOUGHT YOU MISSED
YOUR FRIENDS.

07:16.106 --> 07:19.510
(sighs) YEAH. STILL DO.

07:32.983 --> 07:34.655
(doorbell rings)

07:34.655 --> 07:37.628
OH, I'M SORRY. I'M JUST BACK
FROM A RUN AND ON MY WAY OUT

07:37.628 --> 07:40.631
AND KINDA BUSY RIGHT NOW.

07:40.631 --> 07:43.463
WOULD YOU BELIEVE THAT?
 I TOLD YOU SHE WAS MAD.
SHE'S MAD.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.465
(sighs)
 SUSAN, WE ARE SO SORRY.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.467
WE DIDN'T MEAN TO HURT
YOUR FEELINGS.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.469
WE SHOULD HAVE MADE TIME,

07:49.469 --> 07:52.503
ESPECIALLY AFTER EVERYTHING
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH.

07:52.503 --> 07:55.646
IT'S JUST... TO BE AWAY SO LONG
AND BE TOTALLY IGNORED...

07:55.646 --> 08:00.711
I WAS HOME ALL DAY.
MY BELL NEVER RANG.

08:02.112 --> 08:03.614
WHO WANTS COFFEE?

08:03.614 --> 08:07.217
(chuckles)

08:07.217 --> 08:10.220
SO THERE'S PAUL, AND HE IS
STRUGGLING TO GET LOOSE,

08:10.220 --> 08:12.893
AND FELICIA IS RIGHT
ON TOP OF ME,

08:12.893 --> 08:16.527
HOLDING THE NEEDLE
JUST INCHES FROM MY...

08:16.527 --> 08:19.630
(organ playing "Charge"
ringtone)

08:19.630 --> 08:21.201
OH.
 (ringtone stops)

08:21.201 --> 08:23.203
IT'S DOUG, MY EX.
THIRD TIME THIS WEEK.

08:23.203 --> 08:26.506
I BET YOU ANYTHING
THAT BIMBO OF HIS WALKED OUT,

08:26.506 --> 08:28.679
AND NOW HE WANTS TO HOOK UP
WITH ME.

08:28.679 --> 08:32.082
WILL I SAY YES?
WELL.... DEPENDS.

08:32.082 --> 08:34.183
IF HE REALLY ASKED ME NICELY--

08:34.183 --> 08:36.145
RENEE,
THIS IS SUSAN'S MOMENT.

08:36.145 --> 08:39.950
WELL, SHE COULD HAVE TOLD ME
HER STORY YESTERDAY. I WAS HOME.

08:41.692 --> 08:43.293
I'M JUST SAYING.

08:43.293 --> 08:46.296
SUSAN, WE WANNA GIVE YOU
AND MIKE A PROPER WELCOME HOME,

08:46.296 --> 08:49.299
SO WE ARE HAVING A DINNER PARTY
IN YOUR HONOR.

08:49.299 --> 08:52.733
AW. YOU GUYS DON'T HAVE TO GO TO
ALL THAT TROUBLE. WHOSE HOUSE?

08:52.733 --> 08:54.234
(chuckles) ALL OF OURS.

08:54.234 --> 08:56.236
IT'S AN OLD-FASHIONED
PROGRESSIVE DINNER.

08:56.236 --> 08:59.910
WE'RE DOING DRINKS
AND APPETIZERS AT MY PLACE...
 UH, SALAD AT MINE.

08:59.910 --> 09:03.173
AND FOR THE ENTRÃ©E, I AM MAKING
MY FAMOUS ROAST POUSSINS.

09:04.875 --> 09:07.878
IT'S FRENCH FOR "BABY CHICKENS."

09:07.878 --> 09:10.651
I'M SERVING CHEESECAKE.
IT'S AMERICAN FOR "DESSERT."

09:10.651 --> 09:12.152
WELL, YOU GUYS ARE SO SWEET
TO DO THIS.

09:12.152 --> 09:14.124
I DON'T WANT
TO GET EMOTIONAL,

09:14.124 --> 09:17.127
BUT JUST BEING HERE IN MY OWN
KITCHEN WITH MY BEST FRIENDS...

09:17.127 --> 09:19.129
(voice breaking)
I'M JUST SAYING...

09:19.129 --> 09:20.631
AW.
 HONEY.

09:20.631 --> 09:23.734
(organ playing "Charge"
ringtone)

09:23.734 --> 09:26.196
KEEP GOING.
I'M NOT GONNA ANSWER IT.

09:26.196 --> 09:27.968
âªâªâª

09:27.968 --> 09:29.139
AW.

09:32.072 --> 09:35.345
UH, RENEE, I WAS GOING TO DO
A LITTLE CLOTHES SHOPPING LATER,

09:35.345 --> 09:38.048
AND I WAS HOPING
YOU MIGHT JOIN ME.

09:38.048 --> 09:40.350
OH, THANK GOD.
ARE WE BURNING YOUR CLOTHES

09:40.350 --> 09:43.053
BEFORE OR AFTER WE GO?

09:43.053 --> 09:45.786
I WAS HOPING WE'D TRY THAT
LITTLE BOUTIQUE ON LAKE STREET,

09:45.786 --> 09:47.788
THE ONE CHUCK'S WIFE OWNS.

09:47.788 --> 09:50.961
WHAT? YOU WANNA GO
TALK TO THE WIFE?

09:50.961 --> 09:53.293
OH, BAD IDEA, BREE.
VERY BAD IDEA.

09:53.293 --> 09:56.296
NO, CHUCK'S MEETING WITH HER
TO WORK OUT A SETTLEMENT,

09:56.296 --> 09:59.069
AND HE'S HOPING SHE'LL BE
IN A GOOD MOOD,

09:59.069 --> 10:01.371
WHICH SHE WILL BE
IF WE GO TO HER STORE

10:01.371 --> 10:04.374
AND SPEND A BUNDLE ON CLOTHES.
I'M BUYING, SO IT'S A WIN-WIN.

10:04.374 --> 10:07.938
YOU'LL BE HELPING A FRIEND
AND GETTING A FREE NEW DRESS

10:07.938 --> 10:09.239
FOR THE DINNER PARTY.

10:11.912 --> 10:14.214
I'M NOT SURE THESE CLOTHES
ARE QUITE THE THING...

10:14.214 --> 10:16.116
(whispers)
FOR A DINNER PARTY.

10:16.116 --> 10:18.819
DINNER? I WOULDN'T WEAR 'EM
TO A DRIVE-BY SHOOTING.

10:18.819 --> 10:21.221
(lowered voice) JUST SMILE,
OKAY? DOREEN'S WATCHING,

10:21.221 --> 10:23.924
AND WE'RE HERE TO...
(whispers) LIFT UP HER SPIRITS.

10:23.924 --> 10:26.156
OH. IN THAT CASE...
EXCUSE ME.

10:26.156 --> 10:28.158
MISS? WE JUST LOVE
YOUR CLOTHES.

10:28.158 --> 10:34.034
YES, THEY ARE... SO EXPRESSIVE.

10:34.034 --> 10:36.336
OH, I'M SO GLAD
TO HEAR YOU SAY SO.

10:36.336 --> 10:38.338
FROM THE WAY
THEY'VE BEEN SELLING,

10:38.338 --> 10:41.712
I WAS STARTING TO THINK THEY
WERE... TOO EDGY FOR FAIRVIEW.

10:41.712 --> 10:46.076
NOT FOR US. I'M GONNA TAKE
THESE TOPS, AND... (gasps) OOH.

10:46.076 --> 10:49.079
THESE BEAUTIFULLY VENTILATED
JEANS AND... (gasps)

10:49.079 --> 10:53.283
OH! LOOK AT
THIS LOVELY SKULL PURSE!

10:53.283 --> 10:56.226
HEY, DON'T YOU WANNA
TRY 'EM ON FIRST?

10:56.226 --> 10:58.959
YEAH, BREE,
YOU REALLY SHOULD.

11:02.062 --> 11:05.065
YOU TWO JUST MADE MY DAY.

11:05.065 --> 11:07.798
AND YOU MADE OURS!

11:07.798 --> 11:11.071
I JUST LOVE THIS LOOK ON ME.

11:11.071 --> 11:13.774
THANK YOU SO MUCH...

11:13.774 --> 11:15.245
UH, BREE.

11:15.245 --> 11:17.808
YOU'RE WELCOME, DOREEN.

11:19.149 --> 11:21.011
(bags rustle)
 HOW'D YOU KNOW MY NAME?

11:21.011 --> 11:22.352
I DON'T.

11:22.352 --> 11:24.815
YOU JUST SAID IT.
YOU CALLED ME DOREEN.

11:24.815 --> 11:27.117
OH. WELL, IT WAS
ON YOUR NAME TAG...

11:28.458 --> 11:30.961
OR WOULD BE IF YOU HAD ONE.
 (bags rustle)

11:30.961 --> 11:33.263
THAT'S WHY
WE DON'T CHECK OUT THE WIFE.

11:33.263 --> 11:35.065
UH, WHAT?

11:35.065 --> 11:36.997
OHH. OH, I GET IT.

11:36.997 --> 11:39.699
YOU AND CHUCK ARE AN ITEM,
HUH?

11:39.699 --> 11:41.701
SO YOU CAME
TO GET A GOOD LOOK

11:41.701 --> 11:44.204
AT THE WOMAN WHOSE HUSBAND
YOU'RE SCREWING?

11:44.204 --> 11:46.206
HEY, BREE HERE IS A CLASS ACT...

11:46.206 --> 11:48.909
NOT THAT YOU CAN TELL
AT THE MOMENT.

11:48.909 --> 11:51.011
FOR YOUR INFORMATION,
CHUCK HAS NOT SLEPT WITH ME,

11:51.011 --> 11:53.814
AND HE WON'T WHILE
HE'S STILL MARRIED.
 (scoffs) SERIOUSLY?

11:53.814 --> 11:54.985
SERIOUSLY?

11:54.985 --> 11:56.887
SERIOUSLY.

11:56.887 --> 12:00.090
HE HAS HIGH ETHICAL STANDARDS,
AND SO DO I.

12:01.792 --> 12:03.854
SORRY.

12:03.854 --> 12:05.856
I GUESS I MISJUDGED YOU.

12:05.856 --> 12:08.158
APOLOGY ACCEPTED,
AND I HOPE FOR YOUR SAKE

12:08.158 --> 12:10.861
AS WELL AS FOR MINE
THAT YOU AND CHUCK

12:10.861 --> 12:12.863
COME TO AN AGREEMENT SOON.

12:12.863 --> 12:16.066
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I THINK WE JUST MIGHT.

12:16.066 --> 12:17.367
WONDERFUL.

12:22.973 --> 12:24.815
(door opens)

12:24.815 --> 12:26.947
(telephone beeps)

12:26.947 --> 12:28.278
ARTHUR?

12:28.278 --> 12:32.422
DOREEN. YOU KNOW THAT AGREEMENT
I SAID I'D SIGN?

12:32.422 --> 12:37.057
TEAR IT UP. WE CAN DO BETTER.
 (beep)

12:58.849 --> 13:01.912
(whirring)

13:03.884 --> 13:06.356
(keys jangle)

13:06.356 --> 13:07.888
(engine starts)

13:11.121 --> 13:13.293
(engine starts, gears shift)

13:25.936 --> 13:27.938
(brakes squeal,
engine turns off)

13:41.922 --> 13:43.423
(engine turns off)

13:59.609 --> 14:01.841
I THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD.

14:05.876 --> 14:08.348
THAT'S THE GOOD THING
ABOUT A SMALL TOWN.

14:08.348 --> 14:10.850
YOU START A RUMOR
A HUNDRED MILES AWAY,

14:10.850 --> 14:12.322
NOBODY CHECKS.

14:12.322 --> 14:15.025
OKAY, SO YOU'RE A LIAR.

14:15.025 --> 14:17.327
THEN WHY ARE YOU HERE?
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

14:17.327 --> 14:22.162
YOU WERE IN LAS COLINAS
STIRRING THINGS UP AGAIN.

14:22.162 --> 14:25.936
TOOK ME A LONG TIME TO START
MY LIFE OVER SOMEPLACE ELSE,

14:25.936 --> 14:28.238
AND I DON'T NEED
ANOTHER WITCH HUNT.

14:28.238 --> 14:29.900
DON'T COME NEAR ME!

14:29.900 --> 14:34.144
GABRIELLE, PLEASE. (chuckles)
WHO ARE YOU KIDDING?

14:37.177 --> 14:39.179
I'M NOT THE LITTLE GIRL

14:39.179 --> 14:42.182
WHO DOESN'T KNOW HOW
TO DEFEND HERSELF ANYMORE.
 WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

14:42.182 --> 14:45.255
TRYING TO THINK OF A REASON
NOT TO KILL YOU.

14:45.255 --> 14:47.087
I KNOW WE HAD
OUR PROBLEMS--

14:47.087 --> 14:49.619
I DON'T REMEMBER
 YOU HAVING PROBLEMS.

14:49.619 --> 14:51.621
I REMEMBER YOU
GETTING DRUNK ON TEQUILA

14:51.621 --> 14:54.124
AND COMING INTO MY ROOM
AND PUTTING YOUR HAND

14:54.124 --> 14:57.928
OVER MY MOUTH AND RAPING ME!
I WAS 15.

14:57.928 --> 15:00.400
I WAS
A... (whispers) VIRGIN.

15:00.400 --> 15:03.273
WHAT DO YOU WANT, GABY?

15:03.273 --> 15:05.605
GET ON YOUR KNEES.

15:05.605 --> 15:08.338
UNH-UNH.

15:08.338 --> 15:09.539
GET DOWN!

15:15.315 --> 15:17.447
GABY, DON'T DO THIS.

15:17.447 --> 15:19.649
DON'T DO IT?

15:19.649 --> 15:21.621
I REMEMBER SAYING THAT,

15:21.621 --> 15:24.494
AND IT DOESN'T WORK.

15:25.996 --> 15:27.998
THINK OF SOMETHING ELSE.
 (grunts)

15:33.503 --> 15:37.107
I'M... I'M SORRY.

15:37.107 --> 15:39.609
FOR WHAT?

15:39.609 --> 15:41.671
FOR WHAT?!

15:48.448 --> 15:49.949
RAPING YOU.

15:52.282 --> 15:53.423
(gasps)

16:04.364 --> 16:05.735
GET UP!

16:09.469 --> 16:11.471
START WALKING.

16:18.078 --> 16:20.680
NEVER COME NEAR ME AGAIN.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

16:20.680 --> 16:23.213
(seat belt clicks)

16:23.213 --> 16:26.086
GO BACK TO BEING DEAD.

16:27.687 --> 16:29.419
(engine starts)

16:35.295 --> 16:36.666
(breathes heavily)

16:36.666 --> 16:39.129
(vomits)

16:48.508 --> 16:50.680
SO NO BECAUSE
YOU DON'T WANNA GO,

16:50.680 --> 16:54.544
OR NO BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT A PROGRESSIVE DINNER IS?
 BOTH. I'VE BEEN ON THE ROAD
FOR A WEEK,

16:54.544 --> 16:57.347
AND I DON'T FEEL LIKE A PARTY,
ESPECIALLY IF THAT WOMAN'S

16:57.347 --> 17:00.050
GONNA BE THERE.
 OH, "THAT WOMAN."
YOU MEAN BREE?

17:00.050 --> 17:02.522
HOW LONG'S THIS GONNA GO ON?
 AS LONG AS MY MOTHER'S DEAD.

17:02.522 --> 17:05.224
WELL, THAT COULD BE FOREVER.
 (drawer closes)

17:05.224 --> 17:07.527
YOU GO. I SHOULD PROBABLY
GET TO THE OFFICE

17:07.527 --> 17:09.529
AND CATCH UP SOME WORK.

17:09.529 --> 17:13.163
OH, FORGET BREE. YOU DON'T
EVEN HAVE TO TALK TO HER.

17:13.163 --> 17:15.665
THIS IS ABOUT DOING
SOMETHING NICE FOR SUSAN.

17:15.665 --> 17:17.666
GABY...

17:17.666 --> 17:21.241
WHY THE HELL
DO YOU HAVE A GUN?

17:23.213 --> 17:26.415
ALEJANDRO FOUND ME.

17:26.415 --> 17:29.779
WHAT? I THOUGHT HE WAS DEAD.

17:29.779 --> 17:31.821
NO, HE'S ALIVE.

17:31.821 --> 17:34.824
WHAT DID THAT BASTARD WANT?
DID HE LAY A HAND ON YOU?

17:34.824 --> 17:37.257
WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL ME?

17:37.257 --> 17:39.189
HE'S GONE.
I TOOK CARE OF IT.

17:39.189 --> 17:42.462
GABY... DID YOU--

17:42.462 --> 17:45.265
I CAME CLOSE.

17:45.265 --> 17:49.799
MY FINGER WAS ON THE TRIGGER,
BUT I DIDN'T DO IT.

17:53.173 --> 17:56.176
I GUESS IT WAS ENOUGH
JUST TO KNOW THAT I COULD.

18:02.582 --> 18:05.815
WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ENOUGH
FOR ME.

18:05.815 --> 18:07.817
AFTER WHAT HE DID TO YOU,

18:07.817 --> 18:11.361
I WOULD HAVE SHOT HIM
LIKE A DOG.

18:19.529 --> 18:23.703
(man chuckling)

18:23.703 --> 18:25.875
UH... EXCUSE ME.

18:25.875 --> 18:28.238
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO BE
BEHIND THE BAR?

18:28.238 --> 18:31.110
I-IS THIS A PHOTO OF YOU
AND DOUG PERRY FROM THE YANKEES?

18:31.110 --> 18:32.882
YEAH. HE'S MY EX-HUSBAND.

18:32.882 --> 18:34.884
THAT IS SO COOL!

18:34.884 --> 18:36.546
WHAT--WHAT'S HE LIKE?

18:36.546 --> 18:39.419
OKAY, I USUALLY DON'T TALK
TO THE HELP,

18:39.419 --> 18:42.522
BUT IN YOUR CASE,
I'LL MAKE AN EXCEPTION.

18:42.522 --> 18:44.594
SHUT UP.

18:44.594 --> 18:48.558
OH, GOOD. THE GAYS ARE HERE.
LET THE FAWNING BEGIN.

18:48.558 --> 18:50.600
HEAVENS TO CHER!
YOU LOOK AMAZING.
 OH.

18:50.600 --> 18:51.701
(kisses)

18:51.701 --> 18:53.433
MM!
 (Bob chuckles)

18:53.433 --> 18:56.566
MWAH, MWAH.
 IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU
HOLDING UP SO WELL.

18:56.566 --> 18:58.308
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

18:58.308 --> 19:00.370
OH, YOUR EX-HUSBAND
GETTING REMARRIED.

19:00.370 --> 19:02.742
IT'S ALL OVER ESPN.

19:04.614 --> 19:07.247
WHICH YOU OBVIOUSLY
DO NOT WATCH.

19:07.247 --> 19:10.620
OH, MY GOD. I AM SO SORRY.
WE THOUGHT YOU KNEW.

19:10.620 --> 19:13.483
THIS IS WHAT COMES
FROM WATCHING SPORTS.

19:13.483 --> 19:17.187
THAT'S WHY HE WAS CALLING ME.
HE'S GETTING MARRIED.

19:18.758 --> 19:20.430
WILL YOU EXCUSE ME?

19:23.693 --> 19:25.895
(cork pops)
 UH, RED OR WHITE?

19:25.895 --> 19:28.198
BROWN.
 (pop)

19:28.198 --> 19:29.899
(bottle cap clatters)

19:29.899 --> 19:31.501
(wine pours, bottle clatters)

19:37.547 --> 19:39.409
(chuckles)

19:39.409 --> 19:40.710
YOU LOOK REALLY PRETTY.

19:40.710 --> 19:43.383
AW. THANKS, SWEETIE.
IS YOUR DAD DRESSED?

19:43.383 --> 19:44.884
HE'S NOT BACK YET.

19:44.884 --> 19:46.886
FROM WHERE?
 I DON'T KNOW.

19:46.886 --> 19:49.389
HE LEFT WHILE YOU WERE
IN THE SHOWER.

19:49.389 --> 19:50.890
(compact clicks, clatters)

19:57.567 --> 20:01.601
HEY, PENNY, THERE WAS A SUITCASE
THERE. HAVE YOU SEEN IT?

20:01.601 --> 20:03.303
NOPE.

20:05.575 --> 20:08.438
CAN I TRY YOUR LIP GLOSS?

20:08.438 --> 20:09.939
UH, SURE.

20:11.611 --> 20:14.684
("My Funny Valentine"
playing on piano)

20:14.684 --> 20:16.686
(door closes)
 HEY, GUYS. HOW'S THE PARTY?

20:16.686 --> 20:18.388
HI.
 OKAY.

20:18.388 --> 20:21.391
YOU MIGHT WANNA STAY OUT
OF THE LIVING ROOM, THOUGH.

20:21.391 --> 20:23.693
IT'S PRETTY BRUTAL.
 YEAH, JUDY'S A LITTLE
OVER THE RAINBOW.

20:23.693 --> 20:25.395
(both laugh)

20:25.395 --> 20:27.527
(Renee)
âª ...CHANGE A HAIR FOR ME âª

20:27.527 --> 20:31.731
âª NOT IF YOU CARE FOR ME âª

20:31.731 --> 20:36.306
(loudly, off-key)
âª STAY, LITTLE VALENTINE âª

20:36.306 --> 20:40.610
âª STAY âª

20:42.542 --> 20:44.914
âª EACH DAY IS âª

20:44.914 --> 20:48.348
(cries) âª VALENTINE'S âª

20:48.348 --> 20:50.420
âª DAY âª

20:50.420 --> 20:52.452
ONCE MORE FROM THE TOP.

20:52.452 --> 20:54.754
NO! NO, NO, NO, NO.
"MY FUNNY VALENTINE"

20:54.754 --> 20:56.986
NOT SO FUNNY
THE FOURTH TIME AROUND.
 (sighs)

20:56.986 --> 20:59.258
(Lee) HERE WE GO.
 (playing light jazz)

20:59.258 --> 21:00.430
OKAY.

21:00.430 --> 21:02.392
LOOK, DOUG IS A DOG.

21:02.392 --> 21:04.394
HE'S NOT EVEN WORTH
THINKING ABOUT.

21:04.394 --> 21:06.396
TRUST ME, YOU WILL MEET
SOMEONE ELSE.

21:06.396 --> 21:09.268
YEAH? WHEN? WHERE?

21:09.268 --> 21:12.472
ALL THE GOOD ONES ARE
EITHER MARRIED OR... GAY.

21:12.472 --> 21:14.474
(chuckles) AREN'T YOU SWEET.

21:14.474 --> 21:17.507
I WAS TALKING ABOUT BOB.
 OKAY.

21:17.507 --> 21:21.751
(indistinct conversations)

21:21.751 --> 21:24.484
(door closes)
 OH. THERE YOU ARE.

21:24.484 --> 21:26.516
EVERYONE'S DYING TO MEET YOU.

21:26.516 --> 21:28.688
(kisses) YOU MIND IF
I HAVE A DRINK FIRST?

21:28.688 --> 21:31.391
I JUST FINISHED TALKING
TO DOREEN AND HER LAWYER.

21:31.391 --> 21:32.862
HOW'D IT GO?
 HORRIBLY.

21:32.862 --> 21:34.864
WE WERE THIS CLOSE
TO SETTLING,

21:34.864 --> 21:37.497
AND SUDDENLY SHE ASKED
FOR THE LAKE HOUSE.

21:37.497 --> 21:40.430
OH?
 EVEN HER LAWYER SAYS
IT'S TOO MUCH.

21:40.430 --> 21:43.533
BUT IT'S LIKE SOMEHOW SHE KNOWS
I'M DESPERATE TO END THIS,

21:43.533 --> 21:45.535
SO SHE CAN ASK FOR ANYTHING.

21:45.535 --> 21:47.977
THAT'S AWFUL.

21:47.977 --> 21:49.509
MINI CHEESEBURGER?

21:49.509 --> 21:52.382
âªâªâª

21:52.382 --> 21:53.843
(sighs)

21:58.748 --> 22:01.751
(laughter,
indistinct conversations)

22:07.026 --> 22:08.398
HI.

22:08.398 --> 22:10.530
HEY! WHERE'S TOM?

22:10.530 --> 22:12.532
UM, I DON'T THINK
HE CAN MAKE IT.

22:12.532 --> 22:15.505
HE'S GOT SOME WORK
HE HAS TO DO.
 SAME WITH CARLOS.

22:15.505 --> 22:17.607
THAT'S THE BAD THING ABOUT
BEING MARRIED TO RICH GUYS.

22:17.607 --> 22:21.010
THE GOOD THING? WE'RE RICH.
(laughs)

22:22.372 --> 22:24.674
SORRY.

22:24.674 --> 22:25.845
HEY.
 YEAH?

22:25.845 --> 22:27.847
YOU MIGHT WANNA TALK
TO PENNY.

22:27.847 --> 22:30.079
SHE WAS OVER WATCHING M.J. TODAY
AND SHE SEEMED A LITTLE UPSET.

22:30.079 --> 22:33.553
OH, ABOUT WHAT?
 WELL, I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU AND TOM HAD A FIGHT,

22:33.553 --> 22:37.587
BUT SHE HAS IT IN HER HEAD
THAT YOU GUYS ARE SPLITTING UP.

22:37.587 --> 22:40.730
OH, MY GOD.
 NO, NO. NO "OH, MY GOD."

22:40.730 --> 22:42.732
I TOLD HER NOT TO WORRY.

22:42.732 --> 22:45.735
I TOLD HER NOTHING WAS
EVER GONNA HAPPEN TO YOU TWO.

22:47.437 --> 22:50.069
OH, MY GOD.

22:50.069 --> 22:53.002
UH...

22:53.002 --> 22:55.004
(whispers) TOM LEFT ME.

22:55.004 --> 22:56.706
(gasps)

23:07.817 --> 23:09.819
IT'S NOT LIKE
I DIDN'T SEE IT COMING.

23:09.819 --> 23:12.091
I JUST DIDN'T SEE IT COMING
TONIGHT.

23:12.091 --> 23:14.864
OH, SWEETIE. I AM SO SORRY.

23:14.864 --> 23:17.797
HOW ARE YOU EVEN
KEEPING IT TOGETHER?

23:17.797 --> 23:21.070
RIGHT NOW I'M JUST... THINKING
ABOUT MAKING SALAD FOR 15.

23:21.070 --> 23:22.702
(sighs)

23:22.702 --> 23:24.704
I KNOW HOW HARD THIS IS.

23:24.704 --> 23:27.006
YOU KNOW, BUT TRUST ME,
HOWEVER IT TURNS OUT,

23:27.006 --> 23:31.080
YOU'RE GONNA GET THROUGH THIS
BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT YOUR FRIENDS.

23:33.743 --> 23:35.014
AND TOM.

23:35.014 --> 23:36.986
LOOK, LYNETTE.

23:36.986 --> 23:39.889
IT'S... TOM.

23:39.889 --> 23:43.853
WELL, OBVIOUSLY, YOU DON'T NEED
THREE PEOPLE TO MAKE A SALAD,

23:43.853 --> 23:45.955
SO I'LL HEAD BACK TO RENEE'S.

23:45.955 --> 23:47.957
AND I'LL SEE YOU IN A BIT?

23:52.201 --> 23:53.733
(door closes)

23:53.733 --> 23:56.005
YOU WANNA SET OUT THE FORKS?

23:56.005 --> 23:57.837
FORKS?

23:57.837 --> 23:59.909
WHERE THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN?

23:59.909 --> 24:01.911
THE RECIPE CALLED
FOR MANDARIN ORANGES.

24:01.911 --> 24:04.073
YOU TOLD ME TO GET
MANDARIN ORANGES.

24:04.073 --> 24:06.476
YESTERDAY, AND I WENT
AND GOT THEM MYSELF.

24:06.476 --> 24:09.078
WELL, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT,
SO I GUESS WE HAVE EXTRA NOW.

24:14.083 --> 24:15.755
BUT...
 (clatter)

24:17.456 --> 24:19.489
I DIDN'T SEE YOUR SUITCASE.

24:19.489 --> 24:21.591
IT'S IN THE CLOSET.

24:24.494 --> 24:26.135
(utensil clatters)

24:26.135 --> 24:29.098
PEOPLE WILL BE COMING SOON.

24:29.098 --> 24:31.671
I'LL GET THE FORKS.

24:31.671 --> 24:33.603
(laughs)

24:33.603 --> 24:35.875
I DON'T KNOW
IF I'VE TOLD YOU THIS,

24:35.875 --> 24:37.977
BUT IT'S NICE HAVING YOU BACK
ON THE LANE, KID.

24:37.977 --> 24:39.579
AW, THANKS, KAREN.

24:39.579 --> 24:41.881
YOU KNOW,
IN THE YEAR I WAS GONE--

24:41.881 --> 24:44.113
OKAY, OKAY.
YOU'RE HOLDING UP THE LINE.

24:44.113 --> 24:45.985
TALK AND SERVE, HUH?

24:45.985 --> 24:48.518
WHERE'S RENEE?

24:48.518 --> 24:49.989
I DON'T THINK SHE'S COMING.

24:49.989 --> 24:53.062
SHE JUST FOUND OUT THAT
HER EX IS GETTING MARRIED.

24:53.062 --> 24:53.963
DOUG?

24:53.963 --> 24:55.825
YEAH, SHE'S PRETTY DEVASTATED.

24:55.825 --> 24:58.828
I DON'T THINK
YOU'LL BE SEEING HER TONIGHT.
 OH.

24:58.828 --> 25:01.100
HELLO, EVERYBODY!

25:01.100 --> 25:05.675
THIS IS MY DATE EDGAR.

25:05.675 --> 25:07.907
THE BARTENDER?
 NOT JUST A BARTENDER.

25:07.907 --> 25:09.909
BARTENDER/MODEL.
 UH, PRINT ADS, MOSTLY.

25:09.909 --> 25:12.281
MAYBE YOU SAW ME IN LAST
SUNDAY'S "FAIRVIEW HERALD"?

25:12.281 --> 25:14.113
I WAS "GUY CHECKING WATCH."

25:14.113 --> 25:15.815
OH, SHOW 'EM!

25:15.815 --> 25:18.087
(chuckles) ALL RIGHT.
(clears throat)

25:21.120 --> 25:22.992
ISN'T HE GOOD?

25:22.992 --> 25:25.955
IT'S LIKE, HE REALLY NEEDS
TO KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS.

25:25.955 --> 25:28.127
(laughs) OH.

25:28.127 --> 25:29.859
MMM!
 MMM!

25:29.859 --> 25:32.031
(moaning)

25:32.031 --> 25:35.865
DRUNK OFF HER ASS
AND NOT AFRAID TO SHOW IT.

25:35.865 --> 25:38.808
MY KIND OF GAL.

25:43.012 --> 25:43.973
CHUCK?

25:43.973 --> 25:45.615
(Bree sighs)

25:45.615 --> 25:48.778
ABOUT, UM, THOSE NEW DEMANDS
YOUR WIFE MADE...

25:48.778 --> 25:51.050
(mouths words)
 THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU SHOULD--

25:51.050 --> 25:53.623
HEY, HEY. YOU KNOW WHAT, DOREEN?
I DON'T CARE.

25:53.623 --> 25:55.625
TAKE THE MONEY
AND THE LAKE HOUSE.

25:55.625 --> 25:57.627
IT'S WORTH ALL THAT AND MORE

25:57.627 --> 26:01.030
TO FINALLY BE FREE OF YOU.
GOOD-BYE!
 (beep)

26:01.030 --> 26:04.964
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT.
 OH, I DID. I COULDN'T LET THAT
DRAG ON ONE MORE DAY.

26:04.964 --> 26:08.167
BUT TO GIVE UP YOUR VACATION
HOME JUST SO WE CAN HAVE SEX?

26:08.167 --> 26:10.169
THAT'S NOT WHY I DID IT.

26:10.169 --> 26:12.171
THAT PLACE
IS FULL OF MEMORIES OF HER.

26:12.171 --> 26:15.244
NOW WHY WOULD I WANT TO HOLD ON
TO THOSE WHEN I COULD BE MAKING

26:15.244 --> 26:17.807
NEW MEMORIES WITH YOU?
 OH, CHUCK.

26:17.807 --> 26:19.849
ALSO I WANNA HAVE SEX
WITH YOU.

26:19.849 --> 26:22.752
MMM. AND WE WILL...

26:22.752 --> 26:24.954
AS SOON AS THIS DINNER PARTY
IS OVER.

26:24.954 --> 26:26.155
(chuckles)

26:26.155 --> 26:29.158
MMM.

26:29.158 --> 26:30.960
UM...

26:30.960 --> 26:33.222
HOW MANY MORE COURSES?

26:33.222 --> 26:36.265
I GUESS WE COULD SKIP
THE SALAD.

26:37.927 --> 26:39.829
(giggles)

26:41.971 --> 26:42.972
GOOD EVENING.

26:42.972 --> 26:44.103
EVENIN'.

26:49.879 --> 26:53.683
(chuckles) IT'S A REALLY FUNNY
STORY, HOW WE MET.

26:53.683 --> 26:54.984
(giggles) YOU TELL IT.

26:54.984 --> 26:56.986
NO. YOU TELL IT
SO MUCH BETTER.

26:56.986 --> 26:58.047
(both laugh)

26:58.047 --> 27:00.049
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL IT.

27:00.049 --> 27:02.752
WE WERE THERE
WHEN YOU MET AN HOUR AGO.

27:02.752 --> 27:05.294
EXCUSE ME.

27:05.294 --> 27:07.396
CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A MINUTE?

27:07.396 --> 27:09.899
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH THIS GUY?

27:09.899 --> 27:11.130
"THIS GUY"?

27:11.130 --> 27:13.162
THIS GUY IS THE BEST THING
THAT EVER HAPPENED TO ME.

27:13.162 --> 27:15.164
AND YOU BETTER BE CAREFUL,

27:15.164 --> 27:18.007
OR YOU MIGHT NOT BE INVITED
TO THE WEDDING. THAT'S RIGHT.

27:18.007 --> 27:22.772
I COULD EASILY SEE MYSELF
BEING THE NEXT MRS. RENEE...

27:24.974 --> 27:27.847
UH...

27:27.847 --> 27:29.849
(whispers)
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

27:32.281 --> 27:33.783
(sets down bowl)

27:36.826 --> 27:39.729
(door opens and closes)

27:39.729 --> 27:41.831
(sets down glass)

27:52.071 --> 27:54.173
YOU WANT ONE?

27:54.173 --> 27:56.746
WANT ONE? UH, NO.

27:56.746 --> 27:58.778
NEED ONE?

27:58.778 --> 28:00.079
(sighs)

28:01.981 --> 28:03.983
(liquid pours)

28:03.983 --> 28:05.684
(bottle clatters)

28:05.684 --> 28:07.686
SO YOU WANNA TELL ME

28:07.686 --> 28:10.790
WHY IT TOOK YOU TWO HOURS
TO FIND MANDARIN ORANGES?

28:10.790 --> 28:12.892
WHAT WERE YOU DOING?

28:12.892 --> 28:15.995
LEAVING.

28:15.995 --> 28:19.128
WHAT MADE YOU COME BACK?

28:19.128 --> 28:21.831
I COULDN'T DO IT THAT WAY.

28:21.831 --> 28:24.133
I KEPT THINKING
ABOUT YOU AT THE PARTY,

28:24.133 --> 28:27.706
PEOPLE ASKING YOU WHERE I WAS,
AND YOU HAVING TO MAKE STUFF UP.

28:27.706 --> 28:30.239
IT WASN'T RIGHT.

28:38.317 --> 28:40.319
MY BIGGEST FEAR
ABOUT MARRIAGE

28:40.319 --> 28:42.822
WAS THAT SOMEDAY
YOU'D LEAVE ME.

28:45.795 --> 28:48.357
I... (sighs)

28:48.357 --> 28:51.060
I GREW UP IN A HOME
WHERE PEOPLE LEFT,

28:51.060 --> 28:53.062
AND I HAD TO CLEAN UP AFTER,

28:53.062 --> 28:56.866
AND I JUST COULDN'T
GO THROUGH THAT AGAIN.

28:56.866 --> 28:59.809
AND SO... WHEN I DIDN'T
SEE YOUR SUITCASE,

28:59.809 --> 29:02.741
I THOUGHT, WELL, HERE IT IS.

29:02.741 --> 29:06.345
MY WORST FEAR--HE'S GONE.

29:06.345 --> 29:09.348
AND THEN I THOUGHT, OH!

29:09.348 --> 29:12.381
DAMN!

29:12.381 --> 29:14.753
PAIGE'S CAR SEAT
IS IN TOM'S CAR,

29:14.753 --> 29:17.456
AND I'LL HAVE TO GET
A NEW ONE.

29:17.456 --> 29:21.991
YOU HAD JUST LEFT ME, AND I WAS
THINKING ABOUT A CAR SEAT.

29:21.991 --> 29:24.493
IT WAS SO WEIRD.
I KEPT WAITING TO FEEL...

29:24.493 --> 29:29.068
DEVASTATED,
BUT INSTEAD, I-I FELT...

29:29.068 --> 29:32.401
I DIDN'T KNOW. I...

29:32.401 --> 29:36.145
UGH. I COULDN'T
PUT A NAME TO IT.

29:36.145 --> 29:38.978
THEN, WHEN...

29:38.978 --> 29:42.812
I WALKED IN,
AND YOU WERE BACK...

29:45.184 --> 29:47.987
I SUDDENLY REALIZED
WHAT I HAD BEEN FEELING

29:47.987 --> 29:50.489
THE WHOLE TIME YOU WERE GONE.

30:00.199 --> 30:03.532
IT WAS RELIEF.

30:11.010 --> 30:15.814
I... WAS RELIEVED.

30:17.546 --> 30:20.249
HEY, IF YOU GUYS DON'T PUT OUT
MORE CROUTONS,

30:20.249 --> 30:23.252
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A RIOT
ON YOUR HANDS.
 WE'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

30:24.894 --> 30:26.455
(door closes)

30:26.455 --> 30:29.328
WHAT ARE WE GONNA SAY
TO PEOPLE?

30:29.328 --> 30:30.559
NOTHING.

30:30.559 --> 30:34.333
IT'S SUSAN'S NIGHT.

30:34.333 --> 30:38.337
YEAH, AND WE SHOULDN'T TELL
ANYONE UNTIL WE TELL THE KIDS.

30:40.870 --> 30:43.542
OH, GOD. THE KIDS.

31:00.329 --> 31:03.192
OH!
 OH! AH! (laughs)

31:03.192 --> 31:04.393
(sighs)

31:04.393 --> 31:06.996
OH.
 WOW.

31:06.996 --> 31:11.300
OH! I'M SURE A YEAR OF CELIBACY
WAS TOUGH ON YOU,

31:11.300 --> 31:14.043
BUT AS THE PERSON
WHO BENEFITED FROM IT,

31:14.043 --> 31:17.246
ALL I CAN SAY IS...

31:17.246 --> 31:19.348
OH, MY GOD.
 THANK YOU.

31:19.348 --> 31:20.649
NO, NO, NO. THE CHICKENS.

31:20.649 --> 31:22.651
I SHOULD'VE TAKEN THEM
OUT OF THE OVEN 20 MINUTES AGO.

31:22.651 --> 31:24.653
I HOPE THEY'RE NOT...
 (smoke alarm beeping)

31:24.653 --> 31:27.456
(gasps) OH, NO!
THE SMOKE ALARM!

31:27.456 --> 31:30.219
WE'RE MOVING AGAIN?

31:30.219 --> 31:32.221
NOW WE GO TO BREE'S
FOR THE MAIN COURSE.

31:32.221 --> 31:34.964
I DON'T GET IT.
IS THIS SUPPOSED TO BE FUN?

31:34.964 --> 31:36.165
NOT FUN, ROY. JUST FREE.

31:36.165 --> 31:38.067
SO SHALL WE GO?

31:38.067 --> 31:40.369
YEAH, I GUESS IT'S THAT...
TIME.

31:40.369 --> 31:42.371
AGAIN WITH THE WATCH BIT?

31:42.371 --> 31:45.374
I DON'T GET IT.
YOU USED TO LOVE THAT.
 OH, PEOPLE CHANGE.

31:47.536 --> 31:49.238
(whispers) STOP IT.

31:49.238 --> 31:50.409
(alarm beeping)
 (gasps)

31:50.409 --> 31:52.381
OH!
 (coughs)

31:52.381 --> 31:54.613
OPEN A WINDOW!

31:54.613 --> 31:57.016
AAH!

31:57.016 --> 31:59.548
OH, NO! THEY'RE RUINED! OH!

31:59.548 --> 32:02.491
AH, GOD. CAN'T WE JUST
SCRAPE OFF THE BURNT PARTS?

32:02.491 --> 32:04.393
THERE'S NOTHING
 BUT BURNT PARTS!

32:04.393 --> 32:07.156
OH! HELP ME CLEAR THE SMOKE.
 SURE.

32:07.156 --> 32:08.927
(doorbell rings)
 (Lee) HELLO?

32:08.927 --> 32:10.459
(whispers) THEY'RE HERE!
 ANYBODY HOME?

32:10.459 --> 32:12.461
LOOK AT US!
BUTTON--BUTTON YOUR SHIRT!

32:12.461 --> 32:14.463
I DON'T HAVE ANY BUTTONS.
 WHAT?

32:14.463 --> 32:17.566
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO RIPPED THEM OFF.
 OH, NO! (groans)

32:17.566 --> 32:21.510
...THE SALAD TO GET READY.
WHAT THE HELL WOULD'VE HAPPENED?

32:21.510 --> 32:24.143
UH...
 AHEM.

32:24.143 --> 32:27.346
HELLO, EVERYONE.

32:27.346 --> 32:31.080
I'M EMBARRASSED TO ADMIT IT,
BUT, UM...

32:31.080 --> 32:34.023
MY OVEN MALFUNCTIONED.

32:34.023 --> 32:36.255
IT'S BEEN VERY ERRATIC LATELY,
AND I THOUGHT I'D FIXED IT.

32:36.255 --> 32:39.058
BUT, UH, CHUCK AND I

32:39.058 --> 32:41.060
WENT TO THE CELLAR
TO... CHOOSE A WINE...
 YEAH.

32:41.060 --> 32:43.062
AND WHEN WE WERE DONE,

32:43.062 --> 32:45.434
MY... ENTRÃ©E WAS SMOKING.

32:45.434 --> 32:47.496
I'LL BET IT WAS.

32:47.496 --> 32:50.399
HEY, CHUCK, WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR SHIRT?

32:50.399 --> 32:51.370
(stifles laugh)

32:51.370 --> 32:53.372
WELL, AS BREE'S ALREADY
POINTED OUT,

32:53.372 --> 32:55.374
IT WAS VERY SMOKY
IN THE KITCHEN,

32:55.374 --> 32:58.447
AND I COULDN'T FIND A TOWEL
TO WAVE IT AWAY.

32:58.447 --> 33:01.380
SO I, UM, I USED MY SHIRT,
AND...

33:01.380 --> 33:03.582
AND I WAVED IT SO...

33:03.582 --> 33:05.614
VIGOROUSLY THAT, UM,

33:05.614 --> 33:09.358
ALL--ALL THE--ALL THE BUTTONS
CAME OFF.

33:09.358 --> 33:12.321
SHOULD I OFFER TO LOAN HIM
A SHIRT?

33:12.321 --> 33:13.992
DON'T YOU DARE.

33:13.992 --> 33:15.994
ANYWAY, UM...

33:15.994 --> 33:21.430
WE ARE GOING TO GO PICK UP
SOME ROAST CHICKENS.

33:21.430 --> 33:22.601
CHICKENS.

33:22.601 --> 33:25.204
SO, UH, ENJOY THE WINE
AND... (whispers) GET MY SHOES.

33:25.204 --> 33:29.738
(normal voice) UH, AND WE WILL
BE BACK AS SOON POSSIBLE.

33:29.738 --> 33:32.241
LET'S GO.
 (whispers) SEE YA.

33:34.483 --> 33:38.747
(indistinct conversations,
laughter)

33:41.550 --> 33:43.652
(sighs)

33:43.652 --> 33:45.023
WHAT?

33:45.023 --> 33:48.026
YOU REALLY THINK
YOU NEED ANOTHER ONE?

33:48.026 --> 33:51.130
ARE YOU COUNTING
MY DRINKS NOW?
 I DON'T THINK I CAN COUNT
THAT HIGH.

33:51.130 --> 33:54.733
YOU KNEW I DRANK WHEN WE MET.
YOU WERE THE BARTENDER!

33:56.665 --> 33:59.238
OH, BABY.
WHAT'S--WHAT'S HAPPENED TO US?

33:59.238 --> 34:01.410
WE NEVER USED TO FIGHT.

34:01.410 --> 34:02.371
(sighs) LISTEN,

34:02.371 --> 34:06.315
I THINK THIS HAS BEEN OVER
FOR A LONG TIME.

34:06.315 --> 34:08.217
YOU'RE DUMPING ME?

34:08.217 --> 34:10.349
IT'S NOT YOU.
IT'S... (sighs)

34:10.349 --> 34:13.222
IT'S ME.

34:13.222 --> 34:14.822
BUT IT'S MOSTLY YOU.

34:17.585 --> 34:20.359
(indistinct conversations)

34:20.359 --> 34:22.291
WELL...

34:22.291 --> 34:24.233
EDGAR AND I ARE OVER.

34:24.233 --> 34:26.835
(clicks teeth) I'M SORRY.

34:26.835 --> 34:29.197
BUT YOU'LL ALWAYS HAVE
THE SALAD COURSE.

34:29.197 --> 34:32.471
UGH. WHO AM I KIDDING?

34:32.471 --> 34:34.243
THIS WAS ALL ABOUT DOUG.

34:34.243 --> 34:37.106
WHEN HE CHEATED ON ME
WITH TINA,

34:37.106 --> 34:39.108
I-I THOUGHT HE WAS
JUST SICK OF BEING MARRIED

34:39.108 --> 34:41.350
AND JUST WANTED
TO SCREW AROUND.

34:41.350 --> 34:43.351
BUT NOW HE'S MARRYING HER,

34:43.351 --> 34:47.216
WHICH MEANS
WHAT HE WAS SICK OF WAS ME.

34:47.216 --> 34:50.259
(crying)

34:50.259 --> 34:52.360
OKAY, UM,

34:52.360 --> 34:56.465
EITHER YOU ARE THE MOST
SYMPATHETIC FRIEND OF ALL TIME,

34:56.465 --> 35:00.199
OR SOMETHING ELSE
IS GOING ON HERE.

35:00.199 --> 35:02.100
UH...

35:02.100 --> 35:03.232
TELL ME.

35:03.232 --> 35:06.605
(sighs)

35:06.605 --> 35:08.207
UH... (sniffles)

35:08.207 --> 35:10.209
TOM AND I ARE SEPARATING.

35:10.209 --> 35:12.481
NO.

35:12.481 --> 35:16.715
NO. NO, NO, NOT YOU GUYS.

35:16.715 --> 35:19.688
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
(sniffles)

35:19.688 --> 35:21.820
I THINK IT'S FOR THE BEST.

35:21.820 --> 35:23.652
OH.

35:26.255 --> 35:27.556
(sniffles)

35:32.201 --> 35:35.204
(indistinct conversations)

35:35.204 --> 35:38.737
OH, ABSOLUTELY.
 (laughter)

35:38.737 --> 35:41.240
WAIT A MINUTE.
THIS SHOULD BE ABOUT...

35:41.240 --> 35:43.172
MORE CHICKEN?
 MNH-MNH. NO.

35:43.172 --> 35:45.174
I SHOULD RUN
AND GET DESSERT READY.

35:45.174 --> 35:47.846
OH, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. YEAH,
I HAVE SOMETHING I WANNA SAY.

35:47.846 --> 35:50.679
MIKE AND I JUST WANNA
THANK YOU GUYS

35:50.679 --> 35:53.822
FOR PLANNING
THIS WONDERFUL DINNER FOR US.

35:53.822 --> 35:56.285
RENEE, UH, WE REALLY ENJOYED
THE DRINKS,

35:56.285 --> 35:59.188
AND YOU SEEMED TO ENJOY
THE BARTENDER.

35:59.188 --> 36:01.430
(laughter)

36:01.430 --> 36:04.463
AND, LYNETTE, YOU AND TOM
MAKE A GREAT SALAD,

36:04.463 --> 36:07.165
AND AN EVEN BETTER TEAM.

36:07.165 --> 36:08.297
AND, BREE,

36:08.297 --> 36:09.938
FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER,

36:09.938 --> 36:12.771
YOU BURNED THE MAIN COURSE...

36:12.771 --> 36:14.443
(laughter)

36:14.443 --> 36:16.945
WHICH WAS THE PERFECT TRIBUTE
TO ME.

36:16.945 --> 36:18.747
(laughter)

36:18.747 --> 36:22.611
YOU KNOW, UM,
LIVING AWAY FROM YOU GUYS

36:22.611 --> 36:24.953
HAS BEEN HARD FOR ME,

36:24.953 --> 36:26.955
BECAUSE WHEN FRIENDS
LIVE APART,

36:26.955 --> 36:29.618
THEY SOMETIMES GROW APART, TOO.

36:30.919 --> 36:35.294
BUT NO MATTER HOW CRAZY OR BUSY
OUR LIVES ARE,

36:35.294 --> 36:38.927
SOMETHING ALWAYS SEEMS TO HAPPEN
TO BRING US BACK TOGETHER,

36:38.927 --> 36:45.304
AND THAT STARTED TONIGHT...
WITH THIS DINNER.

36:45.304 --> 36:47.876
MAY WE HAVE... (voice breaks)
MANY, MANY MORE.

36:49.978 --> 36:52.911
AW, DAMN. ALMOST MADE IT.

36:52.911 --> 36:54.283
(laughter)

36:54.283 --> 36:55.213
CHEERS.
 CHEERS.

36:55.213 --> 36:57.246
CHEERS.
 (clink)

36:57.246 --> 36:59.488
OKAY, NOW I AM LEAVING
BEFORE I LOSE IT.

36:59.488 --> 37:01.990
I WILL CALL YOU GUYS
WHEN IT'S READY.

37:01.990 --> 37:03.792
(indistinct conversations)

37:03.792 --> 37:05.894
(door closes)

37:05.894 --> 37:07.856
(whispers) OKAY.

37:12.401 --> 37:13.862
HOLA, GABRIELLE.

37:13.862 --> 37:15.804
OH, GOD! (panting)

37:15.804 --> 37:18.807
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

37:18.807 --> 37:21.310
I KNOW YOU TOLD ME
NOT TO COME BACK,

37:21.310 --> 37:23.772
BUT I'M BETTIN'
YOU WON'T BE SO TOUGH

37:23.772 --> 37:25.274
WITHOUT YOUR GUN.

37:29.418 --> 37:30.949
(hat thuds)

37:41.360 --> 37:43.792
I TOLD YOU TO LEAVE.

37:43.792 --> 37:46.795
AND I DID. I GO 50 MILES
OUT OF TOWN, BUT I JUST COULDN'T

37:46.795 --> 37:49.298
STOP THINKIN' ABOUT
ALL THOSE THINGS YOU SAID.

37:49.298 --> 37:51.770
YOU MADE ME SOUND
LIKE A MONSTER.

37:51.770 --> 37:54.573
I ONLY SAID WHAT WAS TRUE.
 YOU SURE?

37:54.573 --> 37:57.576
'CAUSE WHEN YOU SAID THAT THING
ABOUT BEING A VIRGIN,

37:57.576 --> 38:00.709
I ALMOST HAD TO LAUGH.

38:00.709 --> 38:01.780
WHAT?

38:01.780 --> 38:03.652
COME ON, GABY.

38:03.652 --> 38:07.015
THOSE SHORT SKIRTS
YOU WORE...

38:07.015 --> 38:09.458
THOSE HALTER TOPS...

38:09.458 --> 38:11.820
YOU WERE A LITTLE SLUT.

38:11.820 --> 38:13.792
YOU SICK BASTARD.

38:13.792 --> 38:17.626
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
YOU DID ALL THE TALKIN' BEFORE.

38:19.398 --> 38:22.331
NOW IT'S MY TURN.
SIT DOWN.

38:22.331 --> 38:23.802
(screams)

38:35.013 --> 38:36.715
STAY AWAY FROM ME.

38:36.715 --> 38:39.818
I REMEMBER THOSE NIGHTS
IN YOUR ROOM, BABY.

38:39.818 --> 38:41.990
(crying) ALEJANDRO, STOP.

38:41.990 --> 38:44.753
AND AS FAR AS ME PUTTING
MY HAND OVER YOUR MOUTH,

38:44.753 --> 38:47.756
THAT WAS SO YOUR MOTHER
WOULDN'T HEAR

38:47.756 --> 38:49.858
HOW MUCH
YOU WERE ENJOYING IT.

38:49.858 --> 38:51.059
(thud)
 AAH!

38:52.761 --> 38:57.866
(sobbing)

38:57.866 --> 39:00.869
HE CAME IN. HE CAME IN,
AND HE WAS STANDING THERE,

39:00.869 --> 39:03.872
AND I WAS SO SCARED,
AND I COULDN'T DO ANYTHING.

39:03.872 --> 39:05.574
I COULDN'T.
 IT'S OKAY.

39:05.574 --> 39:07.876
I COULDN'T DO ANYTHING.
I COULDN'T DO ANYTHING!

39:07.876 --> 39:10.348
OKAY, OKAY,
HEY, HEY, HEY!

39:10.348 --> 39:14.423
(gasping)

39:14.423 --> 39:17.486
LET'S CALL THE POLICE
BEFORE HE WAKES UP.

39:19.888 --> 39:21.730
OH, GOD.

39:21.730 --> 39:24.132
(sniffles) WHAT?

39:24.132 --> 39:25.964
THERE'S NO PULSE.

39:27.836 --> 39:29.898
HE'S DEAD. I KILLED HIM.

39:29.898 --> 39:33.672
BUT IT WAS SELF-DEFENSE.
I MEAN, HE HAD MY GUN.

39:33.672 --> 39:36.374
YOUR GUN?
I PUT THAT IN THE SAFE.

39:36.374 --> 39:38.877
NO.
 (clatter)

39:38.877 --> 39:41.480
HE HAD IT.

39:41.480 --> 39:44.683
HE HAD IT RIGHT HERE.
IT WAS...

39:44.683 --> 39:46.815
IT WAS HERE.

39:50.759 --> 39:52.761
I JUST KILLED
AN UNARMED MAN.

39:52.761 --> 39:54.423
(door opens)

39:54.423 --> 39:56.725
GABY, I THOUGHT
YOU WERE GONNA CALL.

39:56.725 --> 39:58.997
(door closes)
 YEAH, IT'S BEEN 15--

40:00.999 --> 40:02.901
WHAT... HAPPENED?

40:05.604 --> 40:07.105
(whispers) WHO IS THAT?

40:07.105 --> 40:09.137
(voice breaks)
MY STEPFATHER.

40:09.137 --> 40:10.739
THE ONE WHO...

40:12.911 --> 40:14.743
IS HE DEAD?

40:14.743 --> 40:17.946
YEAH. I KILLED HIM.

40:17.946 --> 40:21.750
(gasping)

40:21.750 --> 40:24.953
THIS IS--THIS IS BAD.
THIS IS REALLY BAD.

40:24.953 --> 40:27.456
THE MAN WAS IN YOUR HOUSE,

40:27.456 --> 40:32.000
AND YOU HAD EVERY REASON TO BE
SCARED AFTER WHAT HE DID TO YOU.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.833
I NEVER REPORTED HIM.
NO ONE KNOWS.

40:34.833 --> 40:37.435
THEY'RE ONLY GONNA KNOW
THAT HE WAS HERE,

40:37.435 --> 40:41.039
AND HE WAS UNARMED, AND--
AND CARLOS KILLED HIM.

40:41.039 --> 40:44.643
AND NOW HE'S GONNA GO TO JAIL
BECAUSE HE WAS TRYING

40:44.643 --> 40:47.476
TO PROTECT ME!
 CALM DOWN.
WE JUST NEED TIME TO THINK.

40:47.476 --> 40:49.818
WE DON'T HAVE TIME.

40:49.818 --> 40:53.482
EVERYBODY'S COMING.

40:53.482 --> 40:55.654
INCLUDING YOUR BOYFRIEND,
THE DETECTIVE.

40:57.786 --> 41:01.459
I KILLED THE SON OF A BITCH
WHO HURT MY WIFE.

41:01.459 --> 41:03.992
IF I HAVE TO GO TO PRISON,
I WILL.

41:05.694 --> 41:07.566
THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

41:27.616 --> 41:30.018
(jazz playing on piano,
indistinct conversations)

41:30.018 --> 41:32.020
SORRY, IF THESE GLASSES
WERE BIGGER,

41:32.020 --> 41:34.022
I WOULDN'T HAVE
TO KEEP ASKING.

41:34.022 --> 41:37.125
MAYBE YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO DRINK A LOT OF BLUE.

41:37.125 --> 41:40.228
OH, EXCUSE ME. PARDON ME.

41:40.228 --> 41:42.030
HEY. THIS WAS FUN.

41:42.030 --> 41:43.732
I LIKE YOUR FRIENDS.

41:43.732 --> 41:46.705
OH, I'M GLAD.

41:55.914 --> 41:59.688
THIS STRAWBERRY SAUCE
GETS EVERYWHERE.

42:04.292 --> 42:06.725
(clink)

42:06.725 --> 42:11.860
THERE ARE MANY THINGS
THAT BIND FRIENDS TOGETHER...

42:11.860 --> 42:15.934
SHARING A LAUGH OVER
AN EMBARRASSING INCIDENT...

42:18.607 --> 42:22.310
COMFORTING EACH OTHER
IN TIMES OF NEED...

42:24.743 --> 42:28.577
FINDING IT IN OUR HEARTS
TO FORGIVE.

42:32.621 --> 42:36.084
BUT THE THING THAT BINDS
FRIENDS TOGETHER THE MOST...

42:38.727 --> 42:40.789
IS A SECRET...

42:40.789 --> 42:43.061
THAT CHANGES...

42:43.061 --> 42:44.793
EVERYTHING.
