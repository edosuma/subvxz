00:01.302 --> 00:01.469
.

00:01.502 --> 00:02.670
- In the criminal justice
system, sexually based offenses

00:05.106 --> 00:06.540
are considered
especially heinous.

00:06.574 --> 00:09.277
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:09.310 --> 00:11.112
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:11.145 --> 00:12.480
are members of an elite squad

00:12.513 --> 00:14.415
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:14.448 --> 00:17.285
These are their stories.

00:17.318 --> 00:19.287
[screaming]

00:19.320 --> 00:20.554
- It's a hate crime.

00:20.588 --> 00:22.390
- I saw his face.

00:22.423 --> 00:24.125
He took his mask off
for a few seconds.

00:24.158 --> 00:25.459
- Hector Ramirez.
You come clean,

00:25.493 --> 00:27.128
you tell us
who the other two guys were,

00:27.161 --> 00:28.796
you might be able
to cut yourself a deal.

00:28.829 --> 00:30.598
- I didn't kill or rape anyone,
I swear to God.

00:30.631 --> 00:32.466
- What do I need to do?

00:32.500 --> 00:33.567
- Need to testify
in front of grand jury

00:33.601 --> 00:35.169
so we can formally indict him.

00:35.203 --> 00:36.504
- Oh, no.

00:36.537 --> 00:37.838
- Hey,
what the hell are you doing?

00:37.871 --> 00:39.207
- He's being deported to Syria.

00:39.240 --> 00:40.408
- Two people were killed,

00:40.441 --> 00:41.642
and you're deporting
the one person

00:41.675 --> 00:43.511
that can ID the men
that did this?

00:43.544 --> 00:44.645
- The people have just released
Hector Ramirez.

00:44.678 --> 00:46.614
- He won't be free for long.

00:46.647 --> 00:49.250
- The release today of Samra
double homicide suspect

00:49.283 --> 00:52.153
Hector Ramirez
has galvanized civil unrest

00:52.186 --> 00:53.854
outside the courthouse.

00:53.887 --> 00:55.656
Members of the Muslim
and Latino communities

00:55.689 --> 00:58.859
are out in force...
- You guys all right?

00:58.892 --> 01:01.229
- For the most part.
- Wasn't pretty.

01:01.262 --> 01:04.265
- Unfortunately, your day's not
getting any easier.

01:04.298 --> 01:08.269
- What now?
- Maya and Lela Samra are here.

01:08.302 --> 01:11.505
Yeah.

01:11.539 --> 01:13.307
- No, I-I don't understand.

01:13.341 --> 01:16.577
You promised me
that Yusef would be safe,

01:16.610 --> 01:18.846
that New York
is a sanctuary city--

01:18.879 --> 01:22.616
- And I am so sorry.
- No, no, this is on me.

01:22.650 --> 01:24.452
I never should have let him
leave the apartment.

01:24.485 --> 01:27.355
- No, no. Yusef is stubborn.
He wanted cigarettes.

01:27.388 --> 01:31.192
- But he needs to testify.
He's our most important witness.

01:31.225 --> 01:34.362
You said that the D.A.
was getting a warrant.

01:34.395 --> 01:37.498
- By the time we found out
where Yusef was being held,

01:37.531 --> 01:39.267
it was too late.

01:39.300 --> 01:43.337
He was already on
a plane headed to Syria.

01:43.371 --> 01:45.373
- So get him back.

01:47.175 --> 01:49.377
- I have to be honest with you.

01:49.410 --> 01:52.480
I don't know if that's possible.

01:52.513 --> 01:56.184
- So he's just gone?

01:56.217 --> 01:58.719
- And Hector gets to go free?

01:58.752 --> 02:01.722
Like the rapes and murders
never happened?

02:01.755 --> 02:03.157
- Listen to me.

02:03.191 --> 02:04.525
We are gonna find them.

02:04.558 --> 02:06.227
And we are gonna prosecute them.

02:06.260 --> 02:09.697
We are not giving up
on this case.

02:09.730 --> 02:13.234
- Liv, we have a situation.

02:13.267 --> 02:15.536
- Excuse me.
What?

02:15.569 --> 02:18.439
[sirens wailing]
- Move in! Move in! Move in!

02:18.472 --> 02:21.442

02:23.277 --> 02:26.247
[police radio chatter]

02:26.280 --> 02:29.417
- Lieutenant Benson, SVU.
Hector Ramirez inside?

02:29.450 --> 02:31.352
- Being held at gunpoint.
- By who?

02:31.385 --> 02:33.387
- Witnesses say two males,
20s, Middle Eastern.

02:33.421 --> 02:35.389
- Do we know what they want?
- No. Hostage negotiation's

02:35.423 --> 02:37.325
been calling the bar's landline;
they're not picking up.

02:37.358 --> 02:38.759
- Anybody else inside?
- No, they let

02:38.792 --> 02:40.728
all the employees,
rest of the patrons go.

02:40.761 --> 02:43.964
Just the three of them.
We're setting up pole cams now.

02:43.997 --> 02:45.666
See if we can isolate
the hostage takers.

02:45.699 --> 02:48.602
- Okay, I cannot risk
this witness getting killed.

02:48.636 --> 02:50.671
- We're on the same page.
Last thing we want

02:50.704 --> 02:52.573
is to lose a hostage.
- I understand that

02:52.606 --> 02:55.209
but this witness is different.
- We'll try to negotiate.

02:55.243 --> 02:57.345
But if we get a clear shot,
we're gonna take it.

02:57.378 --> 02:58.546
- Ugh!
- Come on.

02:58.579 --> 03:01.549
[police radio chatter]

03:01.582 --> 03:03.317
[phone ringing]
- Aakif, there's a lot

03:03.351 --> 03:04.318
of cops out there--
- Good! They should know

03:04.352 --> 03:05.553
we're serious.

03:05.586 --> 03:07.255
Who killed Kanann
and Shala Samra?

03:07.288 --> 03:08.556
- It wasn't me.
I didn't hurt them.

03:08.589 --> 03:11.225
- Then who did?
[phone ringing]

03:11.259 --> 03:14.295
- Should I pick it up?
- No!

03:14.328 --> 03:16.397
- They gave you a job.
They looked out for you.

03:16.430 --> 03:18.799
This is how you repay them?

03:18.832 --> 03:20.734
- You have a visual
in the back window.

03:20.768 --> 03:23.337
Are you seeing it?

03:23.371 --> 03:26.374
- Copy.
I have a clear shot.

03:26.407 --> 03:28.242
- Take it now.
- Just wait.

03:28.276 --> 03:29.677
- [grunts]
- Ohh!

03:29.710 --> 03:31.245
- Move, move, move!

03:31.279 --> 03:33.814
- Shots fired!
Shots fired!

03:33.847 --> 03:35.783
- No! Aakif, no!
- Police! Let me see your hands!

03:35.816 --> 03:38.652
- No, no!
The Samras are good people!

03:38.686 --> 03:42.356
We just wanted justice--
- All right, get him back here.

03:42.390 --> 03:44.592
- Hector.
- They were gonna kill me!

03:44.625 --> 03:46.727
- Yeah, well, they didn't.
- Get him out of here.

03:46.760 --> 03:48.362

03:59.039 --> 04:02.009
[dramatic music]

04:48.322 --> 04:48.489
.

04:48.522 --> 04:49.056
- They were gonna shoot me.

04:50.491 --> 04:52.025
I was minding my own business.

04:52.059 --> 04:53.994
- What were you doing
in the bar, Hector?

04:54.027 --> 04:56.364
- Trying to get drunk.
I was locked up for three days.

04:56.397 --> 04:58.366
I wasn't looking for trouble,
I swear.

04:58.399 --> 05:00.033
- What did they want?

05:00.067 --> 05:02.069
- They must've been
following me.

05:02.102 --> 05:04.472
I was having a few beers
and they put a gun to my head

05:04.505 --> 05:07.508
and demanded to know who killed
Kanann and Shala.

05:07.541 --> 05:10.744
I said it wasn't me.
I didn't hurt them.

05:10.778 --> 05:13.347
- You let it happen.

05:13.381 --> 05:16.016
You let those girls get raped.

05:16.049 --> 05:19.620
You let Shala and Kanann die.

05:19.653 --> 05:21.489
- They had--
- You did that.

05:21.522 --> 05:23.624
- They had a gun on me.
- And until you tell us

05:23.657 --> 05:27.661
who else is involved,
this is not going away.

05:27.695 --> 05:29.497
- Hector's lawyer is here.

05:33.701 --> 05:35.135
- What the hell
do you think you're doing?

05:35.168 --> 05:36.970
You can't talk to my client.

05:37.004 --> 05:39.006
- He's a victim in a crime.
- Yes, a victim

05:39.039 --> 05:40.774
who's also facing
a double murder charge.

05:40.808 --> 05:43.477
- He was just telling me
what happened in the bar.

05:43.511 --> 05:44.712
Nothing more.
- He's done talking.

05:44.745 --> 05:46.480
- Okay.
That's your choice.

05:46.514 --> 05:48.782
- And a stupid one, at that.
- Excuse me?

05:48.816 --> 05:51.018
- It's obvious
he wants to cooperate.

05:51.051 --> 05:53.554
- Hector has a rock solid alibi
that his wife will corroborate.

05:53.587 --> 05:56.156
You've got the wrong guy, here.
- So the witness who picked him

05:56.189 --> 05:57.991
out of a lineup--
- Is now in a refugee camp,

05:58.025 --> 05:59.727
somewhere in Turkey.
- And that doesn't mean

05:59.760 --> 06:01.529
that his ID isn't valid.

06:01.562 --> 06:03.564
- I have a client to defend,
and as of right now,

06:03.597 --> 06:05.699
the state doesn't have
enough evidence to convict.

06:05.733 --> 06:09.102
So if you'll excuse me, I'd like
to take Hector to the hospital.

06:09.136 --> 06:10.538
Unless, of course,
you wanna arrest him

06:10.571 --> 06:13.974
for being held hostage.

06:14.007 --> 06:15.543
- [sighs]

06:20.147 --> 06:21.749
Chief.

06:21.782 --> 06:23.717
- What are we looking at?
One dead?

06:23.751 --> 06:25.686
- One of the hostage takers.
- What do we know about 'em?

06:25.719 --> 06:27.455
- The deceased is Aakif Ahmadi.

06:27.488 --> 06:29.189
He's 28, he's
a local business owner.

06:29.222 --> 06:31.191
And the other is Daleel Hamdan.
He's 25.

06:31.224 --> 06:34.528
He's a student at CUNY Tech.
Neither one had a record.

06:34.562 --> 06:36.196
Neither has ties
to terrorist activity.

06:36.229 --> 06:38.098
- As far as we can tell,
it was personal.

06:38.131 --> 06:39.800
Daleel said they were fed up
with the slurs and hatred.

06:39.833 --> 06:41.569
They just wanted to get justice
for the Samras.

06:41.602 --> 06:43.471
- They held Hector at gunpoint
and they demanded

06:43.504 --> 06:45.005
that he reveal
his co-conspirators.

06:45.038 --> 06:46.607
- Did he?
- No.

06:46.640 --> 06:48.609
- His lawyer has him convinced
he's innocent.

06:48.642 --> 06:50.811
- So, look, the wife
is backing up his alibi.

06:50.844 --> 06:53.146
So we need to talk to her and
see if we can crack her story.

06:53.180 --> 06:56.717
- Do it fast.
This needs to end...

06:56.750 --> 06:58.819
before somebody else
gets killed.

07:03.156 --> 07:05.759
- It's your fault.
You arrested Hector.

07:05.793 --> 07:07.227
Made people think
he had something to do

07:07.260 --> 07:09.229
with that horrible crime
at the restaurant.

07:09.262 --> 07:11.164
That's why they wanted
to hurt him.

07:11.198 --> 07:13.233
That's why everyone hates us.

07:13.266 --> 07:16.136
- No, they hate Hector
because he was there.

07:16.169 --> 07:18.171
He was in the restaurant
the night of the attack.

07:18.205 --> 07:19.239
- Says you.

07:19.272 --> 07:21.509
- Says the evidence.

07:21.542 --> 07:24.177
- You don't know what it's like.
I can't leave the apartment.

07:24.211 --> 07:25.746
I can't take the kids outside.

07:25.779 --> 07:27.681
- So work with us, Soledad.
You and Hector.

07:27.715 --> 07:29.783
We can keep you safe.
We can keep your kids safe.

07:29.817 --> 07:31.885
- Hector didn't do
what you say he did.

07:31.919 --> 07:33.587
He was home with me.
- This is not

07:33.621 --> 07:36.156
what's best
for your children.

07:36.189 --> 07:38.125
- You threatening to call
social services again?

07:38.158 --> 07:41.094
- Soledad, all right,
if you get on the stand,

07:41.128 --> 07:43.497
and you lie for your husband,
that's perjury.

07:43.531 --> 07:44.565
That's a crime
- Which means

07:44.598 --> 07:45.766
you could be in trouble.

07:45.799 --> 07:46.800
Which means there's no one here

07:46.834 --> 07:48.168
to look after your kids.

07:48.201 --> 07:49.770
- Stop talking about my kids.

07:49.803 --> 07:52.139
- There's no other way
around it.

07:52.172 --> 07:54.174
You are in
a serious situation here.

07:54.207 --> 07:57.678
- Get out. Get out.

07:57.711 --> 07:59.747
Please get out.

08:02.683 --> 08:03.751
[crowd shouting]

08:03.784 --> 08:05.285
- Ignorance, not immigrants!

08:05.318 --> 08:08.088
NYPD needs to protect
all citizens.

08:08.121 --> 08:09.723
- How many more innocent Muslims
have to die

08:09.757 --> 08:11.592
before NYPD does its job?

08:13.694 --> 08:17.731
- We knew the man who got shot,
Aakif.

08:17.765 --> 08:19.833
- I'm so sorry.

08:19.867 --> 08:21.802
- Why did this have to happen?

08:21.835 --> 08:23.737
- It got out of control.

08:23.771 --> 08:25.272
And he did have a gun.

08:25.305 --> 08:28.676
- Maybe he should have
killed Hector.

08:28.709 --> 08:31.712
- Then we wouldn't know
who the other two men are.

08:31.745 --> 08:34.682
- We need to put pressure
on Hector to cooperate.

08:34.715 --> 08:36.850
And that means
that we need proof.

08:36.884 --> 08:38.886
We need evidence.

08:38.919 --> 08:42.155
So is there any detail? Is there
anything that you can think of?

08:42.189 --> 08:44.558
Anything you can remember
that puts Hector

08:44.592 --> 08:46.860
at the restaurant that night?

08:52.866 --> 08:56.203
- I didn't know it was him.

08:56.236 --> 08:59.873
I didn't recognize his voice.

08:59.907 --> 09:03.611
- Anything?

09:03.644 --> 09:05.979
- One of them,
when they first came in,

09:06.013 --> 09:10.317
he had turned off
the security camera

09:10.350 --> 09:12.219
at the front door.

09:12.252 --> 09:15.623
But he went to it straight away,
like he knew it was there.

09:15.656 --> 09:18.291
- So it could've been Hector.

09:18.325 --> 09:21.895
- Yes. Maybe it was him.

09:21.929 --> 09:23.631
- That's--that's helpful.

09:23.664 --> 09:25.599
That's very helpful.

09:25.633 --> 09:29.169
[solemn music]

09:29.202 --> 09:32.706
- We did find Hector Ramirez's
prints on the security camera.

09:32.740 --> 09:34.642
- Useless.
He worked in the restaurant.

09:34.675 --> 09:36.744
- Yeah, but he was let go
three weeks before the attack.

09:36.777 --> 09:38.378
- Yeah, and he was a bus boy.
He cleared tables.

09:38.411 --> 09:39.813
He wasn't in charge of security.

09:39.847 --> 09:42.215
- Yes, yes, yes.
It's weak evidence.

09:42.249 --> 09:43.851
- Okay, we know.
We all understand.

09:43.884 --> 09:45.686
Let's--let's calm down.

09:45.719 --> 09:48.388
- [sighs]
What about the wife?

09:48.421 --> 09:50.791
She's illegal, right?
- Yeah.

09:53.260 --> 09:55.663
- Let's call ICE.

09:55.696 --> 09:57.264
- Excuse me?

09:57.297 --> 09:59.667
Hold on.
Are we gonna help ICE now

09:59.700 --> 10:01.301
deport a woman
with two little kids?

10:01.334 --> 10:03.270
- I don't know, but we're
certainly gonna threaten it.

10:03.303 --> 10:05.372
- You do remember that New York
is a sanctuary city?

10:05.405 --> 10:06.907
You remember that, right?
- She's lying to protect

10:06.940 --> 10:08.742
a suspect involved
in a horrific crime.

10:08.776 --> 10:10.410
Two people were raped,
two people were killed.

10:10.443 --> 10:13.380
The mother and wife was forced
to watch, to listen.

10:13.413 --> 10:15.683
So call me crazy, Detective.

10:15.716 --> 10:17.685
But in the case of a tie,
my sympathy

10:17.718 --> 10:19.653
is with Maya and Lela,
not with the wife of the perp.

10:19.687 --> 10:20.921
- Lieutenant.
- You're right, Carisi.

10:20.954 --> 10:22.890
That is NYPD's policy.

10:22.923 --> 10:25.959
Absolutely,
we all agree on that.

10:25.993 --> 10:28.028
But this is different.

10:28.061 --> 10:30.230
I'm not a shill for the Feds
and I certainly

10:30.263 --> 10:32.265
don't give a damn about
immigration status.

10:32.299 --> 10:37.705
But right now, what's happening
in this city right now,

10:37.738 --> 10:40.007
we need to play every card
in the deck.

10:40.040 --> 10:43.443
So bring in Soledad
and her kids, too.

10:43.476 --> 10:44.845
- Tonight?
- It's late,

10:44.878 --> 10:47.748
her kids are asleep.
- Now.

10:50.317 --> 10:52.385
- My children are U.S. citizens.

10:52.419 --> 10:53.954
I have their birth certificates
to prove it.

10:53.987 --> 10:56.690
- And I realize that.
They're safe.

10:56.724 --> 10:58.391
- But you're undocumented,
Soledad.

10:58.425 --> 11:00.293
If we call ICE, game's over.

11:00.327 --> 11:03.330
- I work, I pay taxes,
I've never broken the law.

11:03.363 --> 11:06.033
- You're breaking
the law right now by lying

11:06.066 --> 11:08.702
to protect your husband.
- He didn't kill anybody.

11:08.736 --> 11:09.970
He didn't rape anybody.

11:10.003 --> 11:11.371
You don't have
any evidence on him.

11:11.404 --> 11:12.806
- Is that what
his lawyer told you?

11:12.840 --> 11:17.044
- It's the truth.
- Soledad...

11:17.077 --> 11:21.749
those two beautiful girls
are worth protecting.

11:21.782 --> 11:23.383
They're young, they're innocent,

11:23.416 --> 11:25.753
they have their whole lives
ahead of them.

11:25.786 --> 11:27.955
But your husband
is a different story.

11:27.988 --> 11:31.024
You cannot protect him.

11:31.058 --> 11:33.126
Now, I'm gonna give you
one more chance

11:33.160 --> 11:35.428
to tell me the truth.

11:35.462 --> 11:39.767
Or else I'm gonna have to do
something that...

11:39.800 --> 11:43.771
[sighs]
That I've never done before.

11:43.804 --> 11:45.705
And that's to call ICE.

11:47.808 --> 11:50.878
They're gonna send you back
to El Salvador.

11:50.911 --> 11:55.148
And your daughters
will go to social services.

11:55.182 --> 11:57.350
Listen to me.

11:57.384 --> 12:00.120
I don't wanna do this.

12:00.153 --> 12:02.422
Please give me another option.

12:02.455 --> 12:05.425
[tense music]

12:05.458 --> 12:10.497
*

12:10.530 --> 12:12.099
Okay.

12:12.132 --> 12:19.172
*

12:25.813 --> 12:27.480
This is Lieutenant Benson
from SVU.

12:27.514 --> 12:29.817
I'm calling
for Special Agent Phelps.

12:29.850 --> 12:31.819
Yes, I'll hold.

12:31.852 --> 12:35.555
*

12:35.588 --> 12:36.957
- Phelps.
- Phelps, this is

12:36.990 --> 12:38.558
Lieutenant Benson from SVU.

12:38.591 --> 12:41.962
I had an undocumented female
from El Salvador

12:41.995 --> 12:47.067
who's refusing to cooperate
in a rape/homicide case.

12:47.100 --> 12:48.468
- I'll send
an agent right over.

12:48.501 --> 12:50.470
- Wait, stop!

12:50.503 --> 12:52.405
- Can you hold on a second?

12:52.439 --> 12:54.842
- I'll tell you the truth.

12:54.875 --> 12:57.477
Hector wasn't home.
Not until late.

12:57.510 --> 12:58.812
- What time?

12:58.846 --> 13:01.181
- He woke me up at 2:00 a.m.

13:01.214 --> 13:03.516
He had blood on his shoes.

13:03.550 --> 13:06.186
*

13:06.219 --> 13:08.455
Please, just let me see my kids.

13:08.488 --> 13:10.924
I'll tell you everything.

13:10.958 --> 13:17.931
*

13:17.965 --> 13:19.532
- Yeah.
- She can see her kids.

13:19.566 --> 13:21.068
Go ahead.

13:21.101 --> 13:28.075
*

13:28.108 --> 13:29.509
Agent Phelps?

13:29.542 --> 13:33.981
Yes, the situation
has resolved itself.

13:34.014 --> 13:36.850
Thank you.
I owe you one.

13:36.884 --> 13:39.853
*

13:39.887 --> 13:42.022
- Were you really
gonna go through with it?

13:42.055 --> 13:44.157
Have ICE come snatch her up?

13:44.191 --> 13:50.130
*

13:50.163 --> 13:53.233
- She just boxed Hector
into a corner.

13:53.266 --> 13:57.270
So he has no choice
than to take a deal.

13:59.506 --> 14:02.009
Go pick him up.

14:08.448 --> 14:08.581
.

14:08.615 --> 14:09.249
- Your wife blew up your alibi.

14:11.284 --> 14:12.385
She said you came home
around 2:00 a.m.

14:12.419 --> 14:13.520
and you had blood on your shoes.

14:13.553 --> 14:14.587
- That incriminates you, Hector.

14:14.621 --> 14:16.289
That puts you at the scene.

14:16.323 --> 14:18.291
- You're going down
for murder and rape.

14:18.325 --> 14:21.528
With a hate crime kicker.
That's life.

14:21.561 --> 14:22.996
- Give us the names
of your accomplices.

14:23.030 --> 14:24.364
- We need time
to talk about this.

14:24.397 --> 14:25.498
We can't--
- No.

14:25.532 --> 14:27.434
They'll deport Soledad.

14:27.467 --> 14:30.170
I can't have my kids
growing up in foster care.

14:30.203 --> 14:32.205
- Hector, look at me.

14:32.239 --> 14:34.274
If you cooperate,
you agree to testify,

14:34.307 --> 14:37.210
I promise you, your wife
and kids will be safe.

14:38.946 --> 14:43.416
- I was drinking with these two
guys I know from another job.

14:43.450 --> 14:45.218
- Who?

14:46.519 --> 14:49.222
- Mitch Jenkins and Stevie Cole.

14:49.256 --> 14:50.924
- Okay, go on.

14:50.958 --> 14:55.262
- I was pissed
about being fired.

14:55.295 --> 14:58.531
And they wanted to mess
with the Samras.

14:58.565 --> 15:01.534
We were gonna
trash the place, you know?

15:01.568 --> 15:04.304
Yeah, send a message.

15:04.337 --> 15:10.010
But then, Kanann fought back.

15:10.043 --> 15:11.945
They kicked him,

15:11.979 --> 15:14.247
stabbed him.

15:14.281 --> 15:16.683
Then they went after
Lela and Shala.

15:21.088 --> 15:24.257
I wanted the money.
I didn't want what happened.

15:24.291 --> 15:26.659
Things got out of control, man.

15:26.693 --> 15:30.463
- Where do these two guys live?

15:30.497 --> 15:33.633
- Mitch is in New Brunswick.

15:33.666 --> 15:35.635
Stevie lives in Queens.

15:40.540 --> 15:43.643
- NYPD, we're looking
for a Stevie Cole.

15:43.676 --> 15:45.979
- Stevie's not here.
- Oh, yeah? Well, we're gonna

15:46.013 --> 15:48.248
take a look for ourselves.
- You got a warrant?

15:48.281 --> 15:50.050
- We don't need one.
Unless you guys

15:50.083 --> 15:52.685
wanna go to jail for interfering
in a murder investigation.

15:52.719 --> 15:54.654
- Murder? What?
- Yeah, your buddy Stevie,

15:54.687 --> 15:56.456
he's a suspect
in a double homicide.

15:56.489 --> 15:58.325
- I don't want anything
to do with that.

16:02.595 --> 16:04.064
- Stevie Cole?
- Yeah.

16:04.097 --> 16:05.532
- NYPD.
- Put your hands

16:05.565 --> 16:07.600
where I can see 'em.
- What the hell?

16:07.634 --> 16:09.536
- You did the right thing.

16:09.569 --> 16:11.104
- Mitchell Jenkins,
you're under arrest

16:11.138 --> 16:12.705
for the rape and murder
of Shala Samra

16:12.739 --> 16:14.541
and the murder of Kanann Samra.

16:14.574 --> 16:16.443
You have the right
to remain silent.

16:16.476 --> 16:18.111
- He didn't do it! He's being
framed by that lying Mexican!

16:18.145 --> 16:19.412
- Please remain calm.
Keep your voice down.

16:19.446 --> 16:21.281
- Call a lawyer!
- Who?

16:21.314 --> 16:22.782
- Go online! Find somebody!
- What's happening?

16:22.815 --> 16:24.484
- You've got the wrong man.
My husband didn't do this!

16:24.517 --> 16:26.053
Let him go! Let me go!
- Hey!

16:26.086 --> 16:28.421
- Mom!
- Sit down. Stop!

16:28.455 --> 16:30.690
- Mom.
- Hey, honey, it's okay.

16:30.723 --> 16:32.492
It's all right, okay?

16:32.525 --> 16:34.294
You want your kid
to see you like this?

16:34.327 --> 16:36.729
Now I'm gonna let you go.
You take care of your son.

16:39.732 --> 16:41.401
- Come here.

16:43.336 --> 16:45.405
- You did this, Stevie. You.

16:45.438 --> 16:47.440
- No, I don't know
what you're talking about.

16:47.474 --> 16:49.542
- Where were you Friday night?
- I don't have to answer that.

16:49.576 --> 16:50.710
- No, but you might wanna start
thinking about

16:50.743 --> 16:52.445
helping yourself out here.

16:52.479 --> 16:55.148
- We know you're guilty.
We're gonna find DNA.

16:55.182 --> 16:57.517
We're gonna find your prints.

16:57.550 --> 16:59.619
- But you haven't.
- Well, we will.

16:59.652 --> 17:01.521
And the truth is,
we don't need to

17:01.554 --> 17:03.056
since Hector gave your ass up.

17:03.090 --> 17:05.592
You're going down either way.

17:05.625 --> 17:07.627
- Because some stupid beaner
told you I was there that night?

17:07.660 --> 17:09.762
- Stupid? No, Stevie,
he's out in front of this.

17:09.796 --> 17:12.532
He's cutting a deal.
So why don't you smarten up

17:12.565 --> 17:14.667
and tell us something that makes
us like you a little more.

17:14.701 --> 17:16.703
- I didn't do it.

17:16.736 --> 17:19.639
Okay, I couldn't have done that.
That's not who I am.

17:19.672 --> 17:22.609
- So why don't you tell us
who you really are?

17:27.614 --> 17:29.382
- I want a lawyer.

17:29.416 --> 17:31.084
- We know you went over there to
help your buddy

17:31.118 --> 17:32.719
get his back pay, right?

17:32.752 --> 17:34.721
- Things got out of hand.

17:34.754 --> 17:35.855
You got drunk, right?

17:35.888 --> 17:37.624
- Drinking tequila all night.

17:37.657 --> 17:40.493
- So what?
- So what?

17:40.527 --> 17:42.629
What else you do?

17:42.662 --> 17:45.498
You smoke a little meth?

17:45.532 --> 17:47.200
- One of the women
that you assaulted,

17:47.234 --> 17:50.503
she remembers smelling tequila
on your breath.

17:50.537 --> 17:52.172
Juries love that kind of detail.

17:52.205 --> 17:55.375
- Well, then, she must've been
talking about Hector.

17:55.408 --> 17:59.212
I mean, Mexicans love tequila.
And raping.

18:01.681 --> 18:03.583
Just ask the President.

18:05.685 --> 18:07.654
Oh, now I get it. Okay.

18:07.687 --> 18:10.123
So you're on his side, right?

18:10.157 --> 18:11.591
Better to stick it to whitey

18:11.624 --> 18:13.593
instead of one of
your little amigos?

18:13.626 --> 18:15.895
- Oh, I don't know. I wanna
stick it to all three of you.

18:15.928 --> 18:18.631
See, but I'm gonna be honest
with you right now.

18:18.665 --> 18:20.800
I'm taking particular interest
in you.

18:20.833 --> 18:22.802
- So have at it.

18:22.835 --> 18:25.805
- You were drinking tequila, you
were smoking meth. What else?

18:25.838 --> 18:27.807
- You're putting words
in my mouth.

18:27.840 --> 18:29.676
- Okay, well, one of the women
that you and your buddy raped,

18:29.709 --> 18:31.511
she survived.

18:31.544 --> 18:34.147
And she remembers what you
smelled like,

18:34.181 --> 18:35.882
exactly how
your voice sounded like.

18:35.915 --> 18:37.650
- Then tell that stupid
Muslim bitch,

18:37.684 --> 18:39.686
with her little head scarf,
to get on the stand

18:39.719 --> 18:41.788
and convince
12 red-blooded Americans

18:41.821 --> 18:43.756
she's telling the truth.
- Yeah, that's exactly

18:43.790 --> 18:46.226
what we plan to do.
- I didn't do it.

18:46.259 --> 18:49.929
But to be honest, I wish I did.

18:49.962 --> 18:52.832
Because those terrorists
deserve whatever they get.

18:52.865 --> 18:55.702
Just ask my cousin Susan.
Hmm?

18:55.735 --> 18:58.705
Her husband got blown away
on 9/11.

18:58.738 --> 19:00.240
Three kids.

19:00.273 --> 19:03.176
These towelhead bastards
wanna kill us all.

19:03.210 --> 19:05.178
Don't you get it?
- No, I don't.

19:05.212 --> 19:06.679
- See, that's the problem.

19:06.713 --> 19:09.782
People like you.
Stupid, white liberals.

19:12.619 --> 19:14.187
Get me a lawyer, bitch.

19:14.221 --> 19:15.955
- What'd you say?
- Hey, hey, hey.

19:15.988 --> 19:17.857
- You wanna say that again?

19:17.890 --> 19:20.560
You know what?
We'll see you in court, Mitch.

19:20.593 --> 19:22.962
You're being indicted,
first thing tomorrow.

19:22.995 --> 19:27.734
[dark music]

19:27.767 --> 19:30.870
- You've waived immunity
for your testimony here today?

19:30.903 --> 19:32.739
- Yes.
- You also pled guilty

19:32.772 --> 19:36.476
to a crime?
- Yes.

19:36.509 --> 19:41.881
I pled guilty to murder
in the second degree.

19:41.914 --> 19:44.751
And kidnapping.

19:44.784 --> 19:49.289
- Any promises made to you,
in regards to your sentence?

19:49.322 --> 19:52.292
- No.

19:52.325 --> 19:56.663
- Tell the jury what happened
on the night of April 24th.

19:56.696 --> 19:59.699
- Me and two other men--

19:59.732 --> 20:03.670
Mitchell Jenkins
and Steven Cole--

20:03.703 --> 20:06.873
broke into the Samra restaurant,

20:06.906 --> 20:10.777
tied the family up, robbed
the register, trashed the place.

20:10.810 --> 20:14.947
Then the owner, Kanann,

20:14.981 --> 20:16.883
started yelling.

20:16.916 --> 20:19.619
Mitch kicked him,
then picked up a knife

20:19.652 --> 20:22.655
and stabbed him in the stomach.

20:22.689 --> 20:25.592
- Go on.

20:25.625 --> 20:27.760
- Mitch raped Shala.

20:27.794 --> 20:30.797
Stevie raped Lela.

20:30.830 --> 20:35.735
But then Shala
started screaming.

20:37.069 --> 20:38.037
And...

20:38.070 --> 20:40.673
[dark music]

20:40.707 --> 20:44.277
And Mitch smashed her head
against the floor.

20:44.311 --> 20:45.712
*

20:45.745 --> 20:49.382
And she died.

20:49.416 --> 20:50.950
- The grand jury just handed
down an indictment

20:50.983 --> 20:52.785
for rape, kidnapping, and murder

20:52.819 --> 20:55.555
against Mitchell Jenkins
and Steven Cole.

20:55.588 --> 20:57.290
We will do everything in
our power to convict these men

20:57.324 --> 21:00.026
and to impose
the maximum punishment possible.

21:00.059 --> 21:02.862
Thank you.
[crowd shouting]

21:02.895 --> 21:04.997
Well, we got our work
cut out for us.

21:05.031 --> 21:06.799
- I'm ready.
[gunshots]

21:06.833 --> 21:07.867
[screaming]
Oh! Down! Everyone, get down!

21:07.900 --> 21:09.336
Now!

21:09.369 --> 21:10.770
- Move! Move, move, move!

21:10.803 --> 21:13.406
- Come on.

21:13.440 --> 21:15.342
- Move, move, move, move, move!

21:15.375 --> 21:16.409
Move!

21:16.443 --> 21:17.710
- He's a servant!

21:17.744 --> 21:20.079
A monster!

21:20.112 --> 21:21.848
[grunting]

21:21.881 --> 21:24.016
[crowd shouting]

21:24.050 --> 21:29.789
*

21:29.822 --> 21:34.727
He's scum!
He's scum, he's dirty!

21:34.761 --> 21:36.629
- Hector was shot.

21:36.663 --> 21:38.898
Son of a bitch!

21:38.931 --> 21:40.900
[distant siren wailing]

21:46.973 --> 21:47.306
.

21:47.340 --> 21:48.475
- Look, all they said is that
the bullet nicked his aorta.

21:50.076 --> 21:52.879
He's in surgery, but it's bad.

21:52.912 --> 21:57.850
I know. I'll call you
as soon as I hear anything.

21:57.884 --> 21:58.985
- What'd Barba say?
- He said that

21:59.018 --> 22:00.887
he needs Hector Ramirez alive.

22:00.920 --> 22:02.822
- And I need a beach house
in the Hamptons.

22:02.855 --> 22:04.891
- Okay, so we've got some more
information on the shooter.

22:04.924 --> 22:06.793
- Okay, who is he?
- Keith Skinner, he's 28.

22:06.826 --> 22:08.795
He's unemployed; he went to
high school with Stevie Cole.

22:08.828 --> 22:10.497
- Did Mitch or Stevie
set this up?

22:10.530 --> 22:13.099
- We don't know that yet,
but all he's told us so far

22:13.132 --> 22:16.035
is that he's an American patriot
and the towelheads and spics

22:16.068 --> 22:20.407
are part of a conspiracy
to eradicate the white race.

22:20.440 --> 22:22.442
I know, I think that even
the Aryan Brotherhood

22:22.475 --> 22:23.976
would deny this guy's
application.

22:24.010 --> 22:27.514
- Lieutenant Benson?
- Yes.

22:27.547 --> 22:28.981
- We did everything we could,

22:29.015 --> 22:31.017
but Hector Ramirez
didn't make it.

22:31.050 --> 22:33.152
- Damn.

22:33.185 --> 22:36.423
- He was our only witness.

22:36.456 --> 22:39.892
- Okay. So we go back in
and we keep digging.

22:39.926 --> 22:43.095
Somehow, some way,
we need to put those two punks

22:43.129 --> 22:44.964
in the vicinity Friday night.

22:44.997 --> 22:47.700
I'll call Barba.
- Copy that, Lieutenant.

22:47.734 --> 22:49.769
[elevator bell dings]

22:49.802 --> 22:52.772
[tense music]

22:52.805 --> 22:54.974
- Where's Hector?
Where is he?

22:55.007 --> 22:56.709
Where's Hector?

22:56.743 --> 22:58.811
Where is he?
I got here as soon as I heard.

22:58.845 --> 23:01.881
- Soledad, Soledad.
I'm so sorry.

23:05.051 --> 23:06.886
Hector didn't make it.

23:06.919 --> 23:08.888
- This is your fault!

23:08.921 --> 23:10.857
You made him a target!
- Okay.

23:10.890 --> 23:14.861
- You made me betray him!
- It's okay, it's okay.

23:14.894 --> 23:17.464
- [sobbing]

23:17.497 --> 23:20.867
*

23:20.900 --> 23:22.935
I can't believe he's dead.

23:22.969 --> 23:28.207
No. He didn't deserve this.

23:28.240 --> 23:30.943
Oh, mami. Oy.

23:30.977 --> 23:38.017
*

23:39.819 --> 23:42.088
- Mrs. Jenkins.
- Like I told you on the phone,

23:42.121 --> 23:43.890
I got nothing else to say.
- Well, we just wanna

23:43.923 --> 23:45.224
chat with you for a few minutes.

23:45.257 --> 23:48.461
Hope that's okay.

23:48.495 --> 23:49.929
Thank you
for coming in, Carleen.

23:49.962 --> 23:50.963
We appreciate it.
I know this has

23:50.997 --> 23:52.865
been tough for you.

23:52.899 --> 23:54.534
- Mitch's lawyer says I don't
have to talk to you.

23:54.567 --> 23:56.168
- You don't,
but I met your son.

23:56.202 --> 23:57.870
His name is Tyler, right?

23:57.904 --> 23:59.572
- What does that
have to do with anything?

23:59.606 --> 24:02.509
- You need to be careful
about what you say, Carleen.

24:02.542 --> 24:04.176
- Are you really
threatening my kid?

24:04.210 --> 24:07.113
- You keep lying to
protect your husband Mitch,

24:07.146 --> 24:10.583
it's not gonna
be good for your son.

24:10.617 --> 24:13.620
- Mitch was with me at home
all Friday night.

24:13.653 --> 24:15.187
That's the truth.
- Come on, Carleen.

24:15.221 --> 24:17.056
You really expect us
to believe that?

24:17.089 --> 24:19.058
You don't think that we're gonna
find evidence that shows

24:19.091 --> 24:20.560
that that's a lie?

24:20.593 --> 24:22.629
Mitch's phone, his footprints,
his DNA.

24:22.662 --> 24:24.263
- If you lie in court
to help Mitch

24:24.296 --> 24:27.534
and he goes down for murder,
you go away for perjury.

24:27.567 --> 24:29.235
Who is gonna be there
to take care of your boy?

24:29.268 --> 24:32.004
- I'm not lying. And you leave
my boy out of this!

24:32.038 --> 24:34.941
- I am trying to help your son.

24:34.974 --> 24:36.543
I also know you and Mitch
have your problems.

24:36.576 --> 24:39.011
You get in arguments,
you get in fights.

24:39.045 --> 24:42.081
You've called the cops four
times in the last two years.

24:42.114 --> 24:44.283
And you dropped the charges.
I understand that.

24:44.316 --> 24:48.921
I get it.
You know Mitch is dangerous.

24:48.955 --> 24:51.858
I'm giving you a chance
to save yourself, Carleen.

24:51.891 --> 24:55.094
- And more importantly,
your son.

24:55.127 --> 24:58.164
- You don't give a damn
about my son.

24:58.197 --> 25:01.300
Because he's not an immigrant
or a queer

25:01.333 --> 25:04.236
or a trans--whatever the hell
they're called.

25:04.270 --> 25:06.005
He's just a regular,
old white kid,

25:06.038 --> 25:08.107
which, for some reason,
is now a curse.

25:08.140 --> 25:12.311
Nobody cares about him or me.

25:12.344 --> 25:14.981
It's like
we just don't matter anymore.

25:15.014 --> 25:19.686
Ask me, that's why we're in
this mess in the first place.

25:19.719 --> 25:22.054
- All that hate.

25:22.088 --> 25:23.623
What's happening
to this country?

25:23.656 --> 25:24.957
It's like all of a sudden,
people feel free

25:24.991 --> 25:26.593
to say all the horrible things

25:26.626 --> 25:27.894
they're thinking out loud.

25:27.927 --> 25:29.161
No common decency.

25:29.195 --> 25:30.597
No filter.

25:30.630 --> 25:32.264
- People have always
felt this way.

25:32.298 --> 25:34.567
Now they just feel empowered.
They have permission.

25:34.601 --> 25:37.136
- Look, I get it. But can you
really blame Carleen?

25:37.169 --> 25:39.305
She's angry, she's frustrated.

25:39.338 --> 25:42.174
She's married to a rapist
murderer who clearly

25:42.208 --> 25:45.144
intimidated her
into covering for him.

25:45.177 --> 25:47.046
- Uh, well, she's certainly
playing the role

25:47.079 --> 25:48.615
of the dutiful wife.
- You mean

25:48.648 --> 25:50.316
the dutiful abuse victim.
- Either way,

25:50.349 --> 25:52.685
she's backing up
her husband's alibi.

25:52.719 --> 25:54.020
We have to prove she's lying.

25:54.053 --> 25:55.622
- We're all over it.
Trust me.

25:55.655 --> 25:57.590
- This is New York City.
Somebody or some thing

25:57.624 --> 25:59.225
had to see those three men
Friday night.

25:59.258 --> 26:01.227
- I already have my guys
recanvassing the neighborhood.

26:01.260 --> 26:04.263
They're gonna find something.

26:04.296 --> 26:06.999
- We hit up every local business
in the neighborhood again.

26:07.033 --> 26:08.901
Finally caught a break.

26:08.935 --> 26:11.203
A deli three blocks away from
the Samra restaurant.

26:14.106 --> 26:16.643
- That's definitely Mitch
Jenkins and Stevie Cole.

26:16.676 --> 26:20.112
- The timestamp says
11:30 p.m. Friday.

26:20.146 --> 26:22.314
That's 30 minutes
after the unis responded

26:22.348 --> 26:24.083
to the Samra's crime scene.

26:24.116 --> 26:26.085
- It does put a dent
in Mitch's alibi.

26:26.118 --> 26:28.154
'Cause his wife says that he was
home with her all night.

26:28.187 --> 26:30.189
- Yeah, but we're gonna have to
give this to the defense.

26:30.222 --> 26:32.124
And they're just gonna adjust
the timeline of the alibi.

26:32.158 --> 26:35.628
- Okay. So, Barba,
this is where we are.

26:35.662 --> 26:37.997
- We need more.
- I can't take this to trial.

26:38.030 --> 26:40.366
We'll get blown up.
- Okay, what about

26:40.399 --> 26:42.334
Hector's grand jury testimony?

26:42.368 --> 26:44.036
- Not admissible.

26:44.070 --> 26:45.337
I already tried
with the judge.

26:48.741 --> 26:51.210
- Maya. What's going on?

26:51.243 --> 26:53.212
- I recognize the faces
of our attackers.

26:53.245 --> 26:54.380
I know who they are.

26:54.413 --> 26:56.348
Mitch Jenkins and Stevie Cole,

26:56.382 --> 26:58.017
the men you indicted.

26:58.050 --> 27:00.152
- You said you didn't
see their faces.

27:00.186 --> 27:02.354
- I could not tell you before.

27:02.388 --> 27:05.692
I was afraid. They said that
they would come back,

27:05.725 --> 27:07.694
that they would
kill me and Lela.

27:07.727 --> 27:10.362
But now that they're in jail,
I am not afraid.

27:10.396 --> 27:14.433
And it was them.
I am positive.

27:24.744 --> 27:24.911
.

27:24.944 --> 27:25.978
- Okay, so you actually
saw the faces of both those men?

27:28.414 --> 27:30.950
Steve Cole and Mitch Jenkins.
- Yes.

27:30.983 --> 27:32.418
- But at first you said
they were wearing masks.

27:32.451 --> 27:35.287
- I know and I am so sorry.

27:35.321 --> 27:37.924
I have been struggling with this
since that horrible night.

27:37.957 --> 27:39.358
- Of course.

27:39.391 --> 27:41.327
Can you be a little bit
more specific?

27:41.360 --> 27:45.932
- When they left,
they looked me right in the eye

27:45.965 --> 27:49.769
and they said,
"If you tell anyone,

27:49.802 --> 27:51.270
"we will murder
your other daughter

27:51.303 --> 27:52.772
and we will kill you too."

27:52.805 --> 27:54.707
- So were they ever
wearing masks?

27:54.741 --> 27:56.242
- What do you mean?
- Did you see their faces

27:56.275 --> 27:57.443
the whole time?

27:57.476 --> 27:59.779
Or just for a few seconds?

27:59.812 --> 28:01.781
- They were wearing masks
most of the time

28:01.814 --> 28:04.917
and then they took them off
for a few seconds.

28:04.951 --> 28:06.352
When they threatened me.

28:06.385 --> 28:08.420
- Did Lela see their faces
as well?

28:08.454 --> 28:12.258
- No. It was just me.

28:12.291 --> 28:14.260
I don't care anymore.

28:14.293 --> 28:17.496
Saying nothing isn't helping.

28:17.529 --> 28:19.298
I just want to tell the truth.

28:19.331 --> 28:21.467
And I want to put
these men in prison.

28:21.500 --> 28:24.937
- Okay. As long as
this is the truth.

28:24.971 --> 28:26.806
- This is the truth.

28:28.975 --> 28:30.810
- She's been through hell.
They're filled with rage.

28:30.843 --> 28:32.945
They're doing what
they think is right.

28:32.979 --> 28:34.914
- What does that mean?

28:34.947 --> 28:36.949
- It means I believe
that Maya believes

28:36.983 --> 28:38.751
she saw the faces
of the two perps.

28:38.785 --> 28:40.352
- Do you think that she's
telling the truth?

28:40.386 --> 28:41.888
Yes or no.
- It's not my job

28:41.921 --> 28:43.022
to think or to guess.

28:43.055 --> 28:44.256
It's my job to present evidence

28:44.290 --> 28:45.958
that I believe is credible.

28:45.992 --> 28:47.293
And since we don't have any
proof that Maya is lying,

28:47.326 --> 28:48.895
it's credible.

28:48.928 --> 28:50.296
- So you're gonna
put her on the stand.

28:50.329 --> 28:51.798
- [chuckles]

28:51.831 --> 28:53.766
We both know that victims
and witnesses,

28:53.800 --> 28:55.467
they change their stories,
they change what they recall

28:55.501 --> 28:56.769
all the time.

28:56.803 --> 28:57.770
Her story isn't perfect

28:57.804 --> 28:58.838
but it's plausible.

28:58.871 --> 29:00.439
- Plausible?

29:00.472 --> 29:02.541
So that's the standard.

29:02.574 --> 29:05.511
- At this moment in time, yes.
- [sighs]

29:05.544 --> 29:07.046
- I'm not omniscient, Liv.

29:07.079 --> 29:08.514
I don't have
a judicial crystal ball.

29:08.547 --> 29:10.316
- Nobody wants
these bastards to suffer

29:10.349 --> 29:12.084
more than I do,
believe me, but I--

29:12.118 --> 29:14.553
- Our legal system
is the best that there is.

29:14.586 --> 29:17.556
But it's not perfect.

29:17.589 --> 29:20.492
Or pure.

29:20.526 --> 29:22.028
It never was.

29:26.465 --> 29:28.100
The night of the attack,
did you see the faces

29:28.134 --> 29:30.803
of the men who raped
your daughter Lela,

29:30.837 --> 29:33.272
who raped and killed your
daughter Shala,

29:33.305 --> 29:36.943
who kicked your husband Kanann
in the head?

29:36.976 --> 29:41.080
- Yes. They're right there.

29:41.113 --> 29:43.015
And there was
a third man with them.

29:43.049 --> 29:46.318
Hector Ramirez--he used to
work in the restaurant.

29:46.352 --> 29:47.887
- When you first talked
to the police, did you tell them

29:47.920 --> 29:50.022
that you saw the faces of
the perpetrators?

29:50.056 --> 29:52.024
- No.
- What did you tell them?

29:52.058 --> 29:54.026
- That they were
wearing ski masks.

29:54.060 --> 29:55.294
- Were they wearing ski masks?

29:55.327 --> 29:57.096
- Yes. Most of the time.

29:57.129 --> 30:01.567
But they took them off
when it was all over.

30:01.600 --> 30:04.103
And they threatened me.

30:04.136 --> 30:07.907
They said that they would
kill me and my daughter

30:07.940 --> 30:10.910
if I ever testified
against them.

30:10.943 --> 30:13.412
- What made you
change your mind?

30:13.445 --> 30:14.881
- Anger.

30:17.649 --> 30:21.153
- Can you please explain that?

30:21.187 --> 30:24.456
- My husband is dead.

30:24.490 --> 30:28.060
My daughter Shala is dead.

30:28.094 --> 30:30.596
And my other daughter, Lela...

30:35.935 --> 30:38.404
she's in so much pain.

30:38.437 --> 30:41.173
It's hard for me
to even process.

30:45.511 --> 30:48.380
I don't care if
I live or die anymore.

30:48.414 --> 30:50.849
That is why I decided
to tell the truth.

30:53.652 --> 30:55.854
- Nothing further.

31:02.594 --> 31:05.097
- I can only imagine
how hard this must be for you

31:05.131 --> 31:06.632
and your daughter.

31:06.665 --> 31:11.003
And how confusing it must be.

31:11.037 --> 31:13.572
The morning after the incident,

31:13.605 --> 31:16.142
you told Lieutenant Benson,
quote, you "didn't see

31:16.175 --> 31:17.944
"any of their faces.

31:17.977 --> 31:20.512
They were wearing black ski
masks the whole time."

31:20.546 --> 31:22.148
- That is correct.

31:22.181 --> 31:24.550
- And then the day after
Hector Ramirez was murdered,

31:24.583 --> 31:26.452
you walked into Lieutenant
Benson's office

31:26.485 --> 31:28.154
and you told her
you did see their faces.

31:28.187 --> 31:31.457
That they weren't wearing masks
the whole time.

31:31.490 --> 31:33.993
- Yes.

31:34.026 --> 31:36.595
- So they were wearing masks
the whole time

31:36.628 --> 31:38.597
until Hector Ramirez
was shot and killed.

31:38.630 --> 31:43.402
Then suddenly, they weren't
wearing masks the whole time.

31:43.435 --> 31:45.604
- No. That is not true.
- You knew

31:45.637 --> 31:48.174
the prosecution's case was weak.

31:48.207 --> 31:50.476
You knew that Hector Ramirez
dying made it weaker.

31:50.509 --> 31:52.644
So you decided to lie.
- Objection.

31:52.678 --> 31:55.147
- Sustained.
- You decided

31:55.181 --> 31:57.449
to change your testimony
to increase the odds

31:57.483 --> 31:59.685
of winning the case
and get justice for your family.

31:59.718 --> 32:01.153
- Is there a question here,
anywhere?

32:01.187 --> 32:03.689
- Get to the point, Counselor.

32:03.722 --> 32:06.492
- Isn't it true that you waited
for Hector Ramirez

32:06.525 --> 32:08.660
to be dead before you told
Lieutenant Benson

32:08.694 --> 32:11.463
that you saw the face of
Steven Cole and Mitchell Jenkins

32:11.497 --> 32:13.099
because you believed that was

32:13.132 --> 32:15.067
the only way to win the case?

32:19.105 --> 32:20.572
- No.

32:20.606 --> 32:24.476
That is not true.

32:24.510 --> 32:26.112
I told Lieutenant Benson this

32:26.145 --> 32:30.149
weeks before Hector Ramirez
was killed.

32:30.182 --> 32:33.152
- You told
Lieutenant Benson

32:33.185 --> 32:35.721
weeks before Hector's death?

32:35.754 --> 32:39.158
- Yes.

32:39.191 --> 32:40.959
- Thank you.
Nothing further.

32:45.597 --> 32:48.500
- I believed her until the part
where she said

32:48.534 --> 32:51.203
she called you and made the ID
before Hector got killed.

32:51.237 --> 32:53.272
There's no way that happened.
- That never happened.

32:53.305 --> 32:55.007
- The defense attorney
just totally

32:55.041 --> 32:56.042
backed her into a corner.

32:56.075 --> 32:57.609
What, she got desperate

32:57.643 --> 32:59.645
after all she's been through?
- I guess.

32:59.678 --> 33:02.748
- Liv, you got a sec?

33:02.781 --> 33:04.183
- [sighs]
- I'll see you back

33:04.216 --> 33:06.285
at the squad room.
- Yeah.

33:06.318 --> 33:07.753
- What?
- I just got the updated

33:07.786 --> 33:09.255
witnesses from the defense.

33:09.288 --> 33:11.223
You're on it.
He wants to question you

33:11.257 --> 33:12.558
about the phone call with Maya.
- You mean the phone call

33:12.591 --> 33:14.026
that never happened, right?

33:14.060 --> 33:16.095
You know that never happened.

33:16.128 --> 33:19.031
- If you say so.
- If I say so?

33:19.065 --> 33:20.166
- But--
- What?

33:20.199 --> 33:22.234
- Come here.
- What?

33:22.268 --> 33:24.270
- She has been through
horrific trauma.

33:24.303 --> 33:27.773
Maybe--maybe she forgot the
exact timing of the phone call.

33:27.806 --> 33:30.109
Or the content
of the conversation.

33:30.142 --> 33:32.178
- Are you suggesting
that I back her story?

33:32.211 --> 33:33.612
- I'm suggesting
that she's human.

33:33.645 --> 33:35.314
I'm not telling you
what to say, Liv.

33:35.347 --> 33:38.517
- Really? 'Cause it kinda
sounded like you were.

33:38.550 --> 33:42.288
- This is a different case.
Different circumstances.

33:42.321 --> 33:45.724
[tense music]

33:45.757 --> 33:47.793
You need to do
what you believe is right.

33:47.826 --> 33:49.661
Simple as that.

33:57.603 --> 33:57.769
.

33:57.803 --> 33:58.804
- Okay, Noah, so Lucy's gonna be
here any minute, okay?

34:01.573 --> 34:02.708
What you making there? Oh!
[knock at door]

34:02.741 --> 34:04.210
There she is now!

34:12.584 --> 34:16.288
Chief.
- I was in the neighborhood.

34:16.322 --> 34:19.625
- I didn't know that people
said that anymore.

34:19.658 --> 34:21.760
Come on in.
Can I get you some coffee?

34:21.793 --> 34:23.795
- No, I'm good. I've already had
about five cups.

34:23.829 --> 34:25.397
No wonder
my blood pressure's high.

34:25.431 --> 34:27.833
- So you talked to Barba.

34:27.866 --> 34:31.303
- I did. And I, uh,
I just--

34:31.337 --> 34:33.772
- Look, I don't need advice.

34:33.805 --> 34:36.275
- I'm not here
to give you advice.

34:36.308 --> 34:39.645
- Okay. So why are you here?

34:39.678 --> 34:42.314
- To offer, uh--

34:42.348 --> 34:44.850
absolution.

34:44.883 --> 34:47.319
- Now you're a priest.
- [chuckles]

34:47.353 --> 34:52.291
Look, Liv, there are
no good choices here.

34:52.324 --> 34:54.693
Hey.

34:54.726 --> 34:57.596
But there are
no bad choices, either.

34:57.629 --> 34:59.698
If that makes sense.

34:59.731 --> 35:02.201
- Not really.

35:02.234 --> 35:04.336
- No matter
what decision you make,

35:04.370 --> 35:05.904
you're good.

35:05.937 --> 35:08.740
I'm gonna make sure
your backside's covered.

35:08.774 --> 35:11.243
- I didn't know my backside
needed covering.

35:11.277 --> 35:13.312
- Over the years,

35:13.345 --> 35:15.614
I've been in this situation.

35:15.647 --> 35:18.417
A few times, myself.

35:18.450 --> 35:21.387
- And?
- And I played it both ways.

35:21.420 --> 35:23.322
I've forgotten certain
things that helped get

35:23.355 --> 35:26.192
the right result and I've
remembered certain things

35:26.225 --> 35:30.762
that helped get
the wrong result.

35:30.796 --> 35:34.900
God's honest truth?
It feels the same.

35:34.933 --> 35:39.905
But that's me. I'm good at
rationalizing things.

35:39.938 --> 35:42.341
Comes with the territory,
I suppose.

35:45.411 --> 35:47.946
- What would you have told Mike?

35:47.979 --> 35:50.949
[tense music]

35:50.982 --> 35:52.951
*

35:52.984 --> 35:55.321
- Same thing I just told you.

35:55.354 --> 36:02.394
*

36:05.264 --> 36:07.666
- When was the first time you
talked with Maya Samra?

36:07.699 --> 36:10.902
- The morning after the double
rape, double homicide.

36:10.936 --> 36:12.871
Inside her restaurant.

36:12.904 --> 36:14.873
- Did you ask her if she saw
the faces of the intruders?

36:14.906 --> 36:17.209
- Yes, I did.
- What did she say?

36:17.243 --> 36:19.711
- She said that they were
wearing ski masks.

36:19.745 --> 36:21.680
- The whole time?

36:21.713 --> 36:23.949
- Yes.
- Mm.

36:23.982 --> 36:26.718
Did Mrs. Samra
ever change her story

36:26.752 --> 36:32.424
as it relates to seeing the
actual faces of the intruders?

36:32.458 --> 36:38.430
- Yes.
- When?

36:38.464 --> 36:41.400
- A week after.
- [scoffs]

36:41.433 --> 36:43.835
Was this before or after

36:43.869 --> 36:46.805
Hector Ramirez
was shot to death?

36:46.838 --> 36:48.840
- After.
- So Mrs. Samra's

36:48.874 --> 36:50.942
version of events
is different than yours?

36:50.976 --> 36:53.445
- Yes, but often victims of
this kind of trauma have--

36:53.479 --> 36:56.382
- Her version is different,
so she's lying.

36:56.415 --> 36:58.317
- Objection.
- Sustained.

36:58.350 --> 37:01.853
The jury will disregard
that comment.

37:01.887 --> 37:03.755
- Nothing further.

37:03.789 --> 37:10.829
*

37:13.599 --> 37:15.334
- You said you would help us.

37:15.367 --> 37:16.868
You said that
you are on our side.

37:16.902 --> 37:18.304
That you would
help us get justice.

37:18.337 --> 37:19.538
- I'm so sorry, Maya.

37:19.571 --> 37:21.273
- You said that you care.

37:21.307 --> 37:22.874
You don't even care.
- That's not true.

37:22.908 --> 37:24.476
- I give you a chance
right there,

37:24.510 --> 37:25.944
right now,
and you didn't take it.

37:25.977 --> 37:27.346
You didn't take
your chance to help

37:27.379 --> 37:29.281
and now the men are free.

37:29.315 --> 37:30.849
Those men who destroyed
my family,

37:30.882 --> 37:32.318
those men who destroyed my life.
- It's okay.

37:32.351 --> 37:33.885
We will be okay.

37:33.919 --> 37:35.521
We will be okay.

37:37.923 --> 37:40.992
- [sighs]
Oh, my God.

37:41.026 --> 37:42.994
- They're angry at you?

37:43.028 --> 37:46.031
- [sighs]
Yes.

37:46.064 --> 37:47.599
- Because you didn't
back up her story

37:47.633 --> 37:49.301
about seeing my husband's face?

37:49.335 --> 37:53.872
- It doesn't matter what
I did or didn't say.

37:53.905 --> 37:56.475
Your husband is guilty.

37:56.508 --> 37:59.545
- I know what they did.

37:59.578 --> 38:04.015
- Well, then
do something about it.

38:04.049 --> 38:06.051
I know that
you called the police

38:06.084 --> 38:08.520
four times
in the last two years.

38:08.554 --> 38:10.522
I know that you know

38:10.556 --> 38:12.624
what kind of man he is.

38:12.658 --> 38:16.061
What kind of violence
he's capable of.

38:16.094 --> 38:18.630
- He's my husband.
- He's a rapist

38:18.664 --> 38:20.499
and a murderer.

38:20.532 --> 38:24.370
And the next dead woman
on the floor...

38:24.403 --> 38:26.405
that might be you.

38:29.975 --> 38:35.414
So don't tell the truth
for Maya or for Lela.

38:35.447 --> 38:39.317
Tell the truth for yourself
and for your son.

38:42.554 --> 38:45.924
Take that first step.

38:45.957 --> 38:48.427
- Towards what?

38:48.460 --> 38:51.397
- Freedom.

38:51.430 --> 38:53.365
Safety.

38:53.399 --> 39:00.439
*

39:03.609 --> 39:06.578
- The night the Samra family was
attacked, what were you doing?

39:06.612 --> 39:09.515
- Watching TV.
- Who were you with?

39:09.548 --> 39:12.618
- My son.
- Was your husband with you

39:12.651 --> 39:14.019
that evening?

39:18.690 --> 39:22.994
- [sighs]
No.

39:23.028 --> 39:25.397
- When you spoke to the police
after your husband

39:25.431 --> 39:28.567
was arrested, you stated that
you and your husband were home

39:28.600 --> 39:30.001
the entire evening.

39:30.035 --> 39:31.503
That you made dinner;
you watched TV.

39:31.537 --> 39:34.440
You were in bed by
approximately 10:00 p.m.

39:34.473 --> 39:37.643
- I was lying.
- Sorry.

39:37.676 --> 39:41.146
You were lying?

39:41.179 --> 39:43.915
- Yes.

39:43.949 --> 39:46.452
- Then or now?

39:46.485 --> 39:49.187
- Then.

39:49.220 --> 39:51.490
Today, I'm telling the truth.

39:51.523 --> 39:54.460
I didn't see him that night
until early in the morning

39:54.493 --> 39:56.628
and he had blood
on his pants and shoes.

39:56.662 --> 39:57.629
- You lying bitch.

39:57.663 --> 39:58.930
- Sit down!

39:58.964 --> 40:00.165
Order.
Restrain him.

40:00.198 --> 40:01.199
- I'll kill you!
- Remove him!

40:01.232 --> 40:02.601
[overlapping chatter]

40:02.634 --> 40:04.903
Let me go!
You're dead, Carleen!

40:04.936 --> 40:07.906
Dead! You heard me!

40:07.939 --> 40:09.975
- Order.
[overlapping chatter]

40:10.008 --> 40:16.982
*

40:17.015 --> 40:19.951
- Today, justice was served.
[cheering]

40:19.985 --> 40:23.522
Just--well, this victory
will not bring back

40:23.555 --> 40:25.624
Shala and Kanann Samra.

40:25.657 --> 40:29.928
Or erase the tragic events
of this crime.

40:29.961 --> 40:33.632
It may help the Samra family
and this great city

40:33.665 --> 40:35.967
begin to heal.

40:36.001 --> 40:37.168
- Boo! Boo!
- Mr. Barba!

40:37.202 --> 40:39.070
- Excuse me.

40:39.104 --> 40:43.208
[crowd chatter]
Thank you, no, no comment.

40:43.241 --> 40:45.744
- A hell of a case.

40:45.777 --> 40:47.513
- Hell of a year.

40:47.546 --> 40:51.116
- We got the conviction.
That's all that matters.

40:51.149 --> 40:54.553
- Wish it was that simple.

40:54.586 --> 40:56.655
- See you tomorrow, Liv.
- See you guys.

41:03.695 --> 41:06.164
- Hey.
- Hey.

41:06.197 --> 41:09.067
- Buy you
a celebratory cocktail?

41:09.100 --> 41:11.970
- No, thanks,
I have to get home.

41:12.003 --> 41:14.540
- Right.
Are you upset with me?

41:14.573 --> 41:17.175
- No.
- Disenchanted?

41:20.746 --> 41:24.182
- We all have to answer
to our own gods.

41:24.215 --> 41:27.118
