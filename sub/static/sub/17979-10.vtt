My mother faced her illness
with courage,

01:05.907 --> 01:08.164
but was still unabled to defeat it.

01:09.366 --> 01:12.936
Unfortunately,
her story is all too familiar.

01:12.971 --> 01:15.748
Especially to so many who are here.

01:15.783 --> 01:20.566
So today, we ride in honor
of our friends and loved ones

01:20.625 --> 01:23.119
who have succomb to breast cancer,

01:23.154 --> 01:26.717
and our friends and loved ones
who are survivors.

01:33.021 --> 01:35.331
And by being here today,

01:35.366 --> 01:37.819
you are not only helping
to raise awareness,

01:37.935 --> 01:40.580
but you're helping
in the quest to find a cure.

01:40.684 --> 01:43.068
You're helping to save lives.

{\a6}Welcome to
the 2008 Subaru Pink Ride!

03:00.609 --> 03:02.942
I am kicking your ass.

03:02.985 --> 03:04.803
- Oh, please.
- What?!

03:04.807 --> 03:06.272
{\a6}You think I can't take you?

03:06.317 --> 03:07.820
{\a6}- Uh, no.
- Oh, great!

03:07.856 --> 03:11.540
- Hey, it's Tasha!
- Hey, what's going on?

03:11.585 --> 03:14.181
- Hey, how are you?
- Hey, what's going on?

03:14.217 --> 03:16.753
Hey, Alice, this is T. and this is Nicole.

03:16.838 --> 03:19.312
{\a6}Papi and I used to play,
uh we used to play basketball with them

03:19.345 --> 03:22.083
{\a6}- before I went to the service.
- Hey, Coco Girls put together a team.

03:22.127 --> 03:24.262
{\a6}- Yeah?
- Who's that? Who's Coco?

03:24.477 --> 03:26.733
{\a6}Oh, it's a gay club downtown.

03:26.777 --> 03:28.082
{\a6}Really?

03:28.126 --> 03:30.333
{\a6}I thought I knew all the lezzy clubs.
I guess not.

03:30.368 --> 03:32.751
It's mostly black.
It's kind of a different thing.

03:35.617 --> 03:37.952
- It's good to see you, Tash.
- Oh yeah, you too.

03:37.986 --> 03:39.922
{\a6}Coco Girls can give you a run
for your money.

03:39.927 --> 03:41.210
{\a6}No doubt.

03:41.248 --> 03:44.160
- You can come party with us later. Yeah?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll come and find you, guys.

03:44.198 --> 03:46.090
- Alright. See you.
- Alright.

03:47.045 --> 03:49.802
{\a6}Was she uh...
was she flirtin' with you?

03:50.466 --> 03:53.312
{\a6}- Maybe. A little bit.
- A little bit? A little bit. I thought so.

03:53.346 --> 03:54.670
{\a6}- Jealous?
- No.

03:59.976 --> 04:04.063
{\a6}... the win's sitting at
2.5 million dollars!

04:04.085 --> 04:05.741
What the fuck?!

04:06.925 --> 04:09.362
- Hi, Tina.
- Niki, what are you doing here?

04:09.398 --> 04:12.222
I'm raising awareness for breast cancer.
Do you know that in ten, we're going die...

04:12.285 --> 04:14.213
You are supposed to be in L.A.

04:14.228 --> 04:16.120
doing the cover for Rolling Stones magazine.

04:16.156 --> 04:18.552
Tina, it's fine.
Adele rescheduled it.

04:18.595 --> 04:21.132
- Oh, you rescheduled it.
- Yeah, Jenny asked me to.

04:21.176 --> 04:23.642
- But don't worry. Mario, the photographer...
- I know who Mario is.

04:23.645 --> 04:25.563
- Mario was hot for Adele.
- No, he's not.

04:25.597 --> 04:27.902
Yeah, yeah. Jenny made Adele hot
and now Mario is totally hot for her.

04:27.948 --> 04:29.841
- Nobody's hot.
- He's totally in love with you, Adele.

04:29.875 --> 04:32.682
- Adele, are you gay?
- Shut up! Okay?

04:32.726 --> 04:35.080
Whatever. Fine.
It would have been good for "Lez Girls"

04:35.117 --> 04:36.690
if you had done it, alright?

04:36.696 --> 04:39.281
But you guys are not supposed
to be seen together. Okay?

04:39.286 --> 04:41.333
I promised your managers.

04:41.335 --> 04:43.452
- You can get me fired.
- Tina,

04:43.457 --> 04:46.201
it's not like we're gonna be having sex
on the side of the road.

04:46.205 --> 04:49.251
Here. Look. I'll put these on
and no one will recognize me.

04:49.257 --> 04:50.761
- Excuse me.
- Right?

04:50.768 --> 04:52.510
- Are you Niki Stevens?
- Yeah.

04:52.617 --> 04:55.870
I quit. I fucking quit.

04:55.885 --> 04:58.700
Bringing in awareness around the glob,

04:58.737 --> 05:01.820
- to breast cancer!
- Grab your hands, that's a good one.

05:05.247 --> 05:06.933
- Alright. Hey! Here.
- What?

05:09.066 --> 05:10.693
Why are you here?

05:10.738 --> 05:14.190
Well I had this great pink shirt
that said Subaru already,

05:14.228 --> 05:16.672
- so I figured I just...
- Molly, go home.

05:16.716 --> 05:18.571
It's a free country.
I can support boobs if I want to.

05:18.618 --> 05:20.032
Go boobs!

05:21.096 --> 05:22.670
See?

05:22.716 --> 05:25.013
So you, you flew all the way up here?

05:26.918 --> 05:29.890
She flew all the way up here
to keep fighting with you, girl.

05:29.925 --> 05:32.662
That's true love! That's true love.

05:33.547 --> 05:36.083
Okay, I know it's probably stalking,
but if you would listen to me...

05:36.117 --> 05:37.832
Molly, I don't wanna listen to you.

05:37.878 --> 05:39.172
I really don't.

05:39.217 --> 05:40.861
I'm the uneducated one, remember?

05:40.908 --> 05:44.392
Isn't that what you said to your mom?
I'm uneducated. No, no. Listen to me.

05:44.436 --> 05:47.663
I think those were your exact words,
right? No, they were!

05:47.698 --> 05:50.750
I don't wanna be your fucking
loser fuck buddy. I really don't.

05:50.798 --> 05:52.872
I don't want you to pity me,
I don't want you to save me.

05:52.945 --> 05:55.571
I don't wanna be your teacher
in the gay world. I don't wanna any of it.

05:55.627 --> 05:57.183
- So just, just go home.
- 5,

- "To Die in L.A." by West Indian Girl -

07:20.328 --> 07:21.992
I need to tell you something.

07:22.038 --> 07:23.140
What?

07:23.988 --> 07:26.631
You look really great in those pants.

07:26.676 --> 07:28.923
Fuck you...

07:28.965 --> 07:30.542
Fuck you!

07:37.076 --> 07:38.263
Yeah?

07:38.296 --> 07:40.543
I don't want Jodi to know about us.

07:41.138 --> 07:43.493
She's gonna find out eventually.

07:43.527 --> 07:45.891
No, I mean, I don't want

07:45.938 --> 07:48.730
her to know that we were fooling around
behind her back.

07:51.397 --> 07:52.650
I mean,

07:52.685 --> 07:54.760
it's okay if she thinks
we talked about it,

07:54.865 --> 07:57.211
but I don't want her to think
we acted on it,

07:57.245 --> 07:59.913
you know,
before the two of you broke up.

08:02.095 --> 08:04.452
I don't want anybody to know.

08:04.495 --> 08:05.913
Except for Kit.

08:07.625 --> 08:09.992
Yeah, nobody needs to know, Tina.

08:18.378 --> 08:20.400
She, she doesn't need to know.

08:26.095 --> 08:27.640
Well,

08:28.548 --> 08:29.853
to your left.

08:34.926 --> 08:36.702
Come on, Tasha.

08:36.736 --> 08:39.270
Hurry up!
Come on, come on, come on!

08:39.308 --> 08:41.501
- Come on.
- Let's roll. Hurry up!

08:41.535 --> 08:43.311
It's a ride. Not a race.

08:43.318 --> 08:44.652
Come on!

08:44.657 --> 08:47.272
Alright, just go ahead.

09:03.847 --> 09:05.452
How long do you think
it will last for?

09:05.457 --> 09:08.070
I have no idea, but
I am not dressed for this weather.

09:08.078 --> 09:09.471
We love you, Niki!

09:11.568 --> 09:13.311
Does that ever bother you?

09:13.317 --> 09:15.380
No, much of the time, it's funny.

09:17.928 --> 09:20.262
So how long have you and Jenny
been friends for?

09:20.268 --> 09:21.393
Two years.

09:21.396 --> 09:22.852
Where did you guys meet?

09:22.855 --> 09:24.613
Bette and Tina had a party two years ago.

09:24.615 --> 09:26.491
That's when Jenny first moved to L.A.

09:26.496 --> 09:28.581
Oh, yeah, yeah. We shot that scene.

09:28.595 --> 09:31.112
- Yes, we did.
- Yes.

09:31.115 --> 09:33.813
So, did you guys ever hook up?

09:34.467 --> 09:35.881
- Me and Jenny?!
- Yeah.

09:35.927 --> 09:37.203
Fuck no!

09:37.247 --> 09:38.683
Why not? My friends are
always sleeping out

09:38.725 --> 09:40.743
with each other. So...

09:40.777 --> 09:42.973
No, not in this case.

09:43.308 --> 09:45.613
- Well, you know, she's really beautiful...
- Yes, she is.

09:45.678 --> 09:48.343
...and you're not so bad yourself.
So, I'm surprised.

09:50.197 --> 09:53.993
Well, I figure that
just because you can, it

09:54.035 --> 09:55.931
doesn't mean you should.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.513
- Hey! Where have you been?
- Fuck!

09:59.546 --> 10:01.973
I fucked my pussy.

10:02.015 --> 10:04.403
It's so numb.

10:08.687 --> 10:09.970
- Hi.
- Listen.

10:09.978 --> 10:11.363
- What?
- Can you please

10:11.398 --> 10:12.723
do something about the stalker?

10:12.768 --> 10:15.032
- I don't have to do anything about my stalker.
- Yes, you do.

10:15.076 --> 10:17.472
- No.
- 'Cause she's been following you around for 30 miles.

10:17.506 --> 10:20.192
Yeah, well that means
I have 170 to go.

10:20.238 --> 10:21.730
- You guys come with?
- No.

- "Sofia" by West Indian Girl -

10:52.229 --> 10:53.285
I race you.

10:54.784 --> 10:56.752
- What?
- Next pit stop.

10:56.789 --> 10:59.202
If I win, you have to listen.
If you win, I go home.

11:05.727 --> 11:07.371
Alright. Go, go!

11:07.415 --> 11:08.890
Shit!

11:08.938 --> 11:10.793
I'm sorry!

11:15.605 --> 11:18.590
Just give me another chance!
Please!

11:18.635 --> 11:21.182
I'm sorry! Come on!

11:23.587 --> 11:24.741
Come on...

11:26.515 --> 11:27.581
No!

11:43.586 --> 11:45.920
- I love you!
- What?!

11:45.965 --> 11:47.863
Whoa, wait.

11:49.556 --> 11:51.413
- I won.
- No, no, no, no.

11:51.856 --> 11:54.730
Wait, you're in love with me?

11:54.778 --> 11:56.652
No. I just said that so you would stop.

11:56.685 --> 11:57.861
You cheated.

11:57.898 --> 12:00.100
Ow! So what, I still won.

12:01.427 --> 12:03.323
Oh, my ass is killing me.

12:03.366 --> 12:05.400
Okay, I know I'm a disaster,
but you have to listen to me

12:05.448 --> 12:06.793
because that was the bet.

12:08.775 --> 12:11.031
- Make it fast.
- I don't know if I'm gay,

12:11.068 --> 12:13.792
I don't know if I'm straight,
but I know that I want to be with you.

12:15.075 --> 12:18.773
- We had terrible sex.
- No, it was great for me!

12:18.808 --> 12:21.161
You don't just get on a bike
and know how to ride it.

12:21.218 --> 12:22.872
Same with riding a girl.

12:22.905 --> 12:24.732
So I freaked out. Big deal.

12:24.748 --> 12:27.701
You've just been with so many girls
that you don't remember your first time.

12:27.746 --> 12:29.971
Well, guess what, it was my first time.

12:30.008 --> 12:31.431
And it was great!

12:31.477 --> 12:33.350
It was better than with Richard,
and with guys,

12:33.437 --> 12:35.182
and with anybody!
And I'm really into you!

12:35.216 --> 12:37.370
And I swear, next time,
I will so go down on you!

12:37.415 --> 12:39.993
Molly, Molly, you're making a scene.
Please.

12:41.547 --> 12:43.273
Seriously, why do you want to be with me?

12:43.318 --> 12:45.023
Think about it.
Because you've been using me

12:45.078 --> 12:47.621
- to get back at your mother the whole time.
- I haven't.

12:48.185 --> 12:50.140
I haven't been using you.

12:50.186 --> 12:54.043
I've never flown to the Pacific Northwest
to chase a girl I barely know.

12:54.085 --> 12:56.400
And I'm here
and I'm really crazy about you.

12:56.448 --> 12:58.820
And I need you to give me another chance
even if I'm

12:58.865 --> 13:00.542
awful in bed.

13:00.548 --> 13:03.773
I know I'm still Gay 101,
but I'm a really fast learner

13:03.815 --> 13:05.990
and before you know it,
I'm gonna be Advanced Placement Gay,

13:06.025 --> 13:07.381
and then Graduate Level Gay,

13:07.425 --> 13:10.490
and fuck law school,
I'll get my Doctorate in fucking Gay!

13:20.795 --> 13:22.421
Are you going to stop talking?

13:22.456 --> 13:24.150
- Yes.
- Promise me?

13:28.528 --> 13:30.091
No more pink, though.

13:33.647 --> 13:36.442
Oh ladies, look at this.

14:01.888 --> 14:04.492
So many. there are so many.

14:24.095 --> 14:25.770
We love you Dana,

14:25.815 --> 14:27.530
and we miss you every day.

14:29.665 --> 14:31.361
You're in our hearts, Dana.

by Moby feat. Azure Ray -

15:34.667 --> 15:38.003
I wish Angie was with with us today.

15:38.035 --> 15:40.421
She would love this.

15:42.188 --> 15:43.943
Yeah, she would.

- "To the Stars" by Erin McKeown -

18:13.586 --> 18:16.421
Is there like a hotel or something
we could check into?

18:16.457 --> 18:19.750
Alright, girl, I'd rent a car
so we can drive the rest of the day.

18:23.915 --> 18:25.722
Where have you been?

18:25.755 --> 18:28.342
- I've been here for like two hours already.
- What?!

18:28.387 --> 18:30.543
- ???
- What you've been doing?

18:30.577 --> 18:31.892
I've been waiting.

18:31.927 --> 18:34.592
- With T. and Nicole.
- Oh yeah?

18:35.055 --> 18:36.261
- No.
- No.

18:36.266 --> 18:38.932
- Good.
- We were just talking about old times.

18:39.378 --> 18:41.850
They want us to hang out
with them later if you want to.

18:41.878 --> 18:43.412
I think you'd really like them.

18:44.265 --> 18:46.620
I kinda like to hang out
with who I came with.

18:46.667 --> 18:48.471
You know,
I wouldn't feel right about leaving.

18:48.517 --> 18:52.240
- But you should, if you want.
- No, it's cool.

18:52.288 --> 18:55.063
We can just catch up with them later,
in L.A.

18:55.097 --> 18:57.603
- Can you lift it?
- Yeah, lift, like this.

19:00.286 --> 19:02.702
Okay, I'll hold it.
You're ready?

19:06.878 --> 19:08.632
Oh my God! Look at this!

19:08.676 --> 19:10.612
- This is so fucking unbelievable.
- I love it.

19:10.658 --> 19:12.441
- Hi guys.
- Merci, merci, merci.

19:12.455 --> 19:15.110
- I thought you might want your provacy.
- What the fuck is this, the Taj Majal?

19:15.146 --> 19:16.650
Hey, Tina. No,

19:16.688 --> 19:19.472
I had production make
a product placement deal with North Face.

19:19.477 --> 19:22.371
The only thing that we need to do is

19:22.408 --> 19:24.862
just taking a picture of Niki
in front of the tent. Hey, Niki?

19:24.907 --> 19:25.973
- Yeah?
- Hi.

19:26.008 --> 19:27.302
- Will you pose for me?
- Yeah.

19:27.356 --> 19:28.591
Okay. 1,

19:28.626 --> 19:29.871
2,

19:29.908 --> 19:31.122
3.

19:32.905 --> 19:34.071
Beautiful.

19:37.695 --> 19:39.513
- No, this goes in here.
- Yeah, I know.

19:39.556 --> 19:42.020
It says: "You put tab B into slot J".

19:42.055 --> 19:44.293
- But you're doing it wrong.
- Look, I'm not an idiot.

19:44.335 --> 19:47.430
I can just fucking follow
some simple instructions.

19:47.476 --> 19:50.391
Wait, look. I would appreciate
if you wouldn't second guess me.

20:01.586 --> 20:02.870
- Adele?
- Yeah?

20:02.916 --> 20:05.100
You mind just closing
the curtains for us, please?

20:05.175 --> 20:05.942
Sure.

20:21.086 --> 20:23.383
What kind of bullshit tent is this?

20:23.426 --> 20:25.692
It was on sale at Costco.

20:25.726 --> 20:28.110
And you expect me to have
Advanced Placement lesbian sex

20:28.145 --> 20:30.891
- in this shitty runt tent?
- Yeah, I do.

20:34.817 --> 20:37.451
What the hell is that?!
Is that Jenny's tent?

20:37.485 --> 20:38.920
I think so.

20:39.376 --> 20:41.162
My God, it looks like a condo.

20:41.665 --> 20:44.442
I don't think
she got that on sale at Costco.

20:48.856 --> 20:50.011
Come on.

21:09.637 --> 21:12.853
- Oh shit!
- Oh my God, oh my God.

21:15.577 --> 21:18.230
Adele! We're being killed!

21:20.905 --> 21:22.300
Thank you. It's,

21:22.346 --> 21:24.392
it's so hard to do this by yourself.

21:24.427 --> 21:26.690
I'm using to putting things together.

21:26.737 --> 21:29.320
Yeah, but Bette wouldn't let me help her.

21:29.997 --> 21:32.563
Yeah. She's kind of uh...

21:33.545 --> 21:34.720
OCD.

21:37.985 --> 21:39.861
Was she moody with you?

21:40.795 --> 21:43.501
Yeah. Sometimes

21:43.536 --> 21:45.471
she can be moody.

21:45.505 --> 21:49.610
Something's going on with her,
but I don't know what it is.

21:51.735 --> 21:55.111
- Is Angelica okay?
- Yeah. She's,

21:55.146 --> 21:56.603
she's fine.

22:02.028 --> 22:02.932
Thank you.

22:06.316 --> 22:07.390
Have a good day.

22:28.078 --> 22:30.211
Oh you faked this up?

22:50.236 --> 22:52.430
God, do you ever stop working?

22:52.976 --> 22:55.372
No, not really.

22:59.018 --> 23:03.301
So, what's your deal.
Are you gay or what? C'mon.

23:06.925 --> 23:08.461
That depends.

23:08.495 --> 23:10.081
Depends on what?

23:10.787 --> 23:13.830
- It depends on who's asking.
- I'm asking.

23:13.866 --> 23:15.583
Are you seeing anyone?

23:16.036 --> 23:17.490
I'm single.

23:17.538 --> 23:19.643
This is great! We should set you up.

23:19.687 --> 23:21.921
'Cause, that's what these rides are for,
I mean,

23:21.968 --> 23:24.740
curing cancer and one night stands.
Totally.

23:26.585 --> 23:28.760
No, I think that uh..

23:29.635 --> 23:32.132
I prefer just to stay focused
on my work.

23:32.785 --> 23:34.723
Come on, it's boring.

23:37.535 --> 23:39.261
Okay, all right.

23:39.295 --> 23:41.662
Okay. There's somebody
that I have my eye on.

23:41.695 --> 23:42.901
Who?

23:42.945 --> 23:44.822
It's a secret.

23:48.788 --> 23:50.600
- Yeah.
- Okay, I'm being summoned.

24:13.417 --> 24:15.573
I sure hope you know
what you're doing.

24:18.455 --> 24:20.822
I have it completely under control.
Don't worry about it.

24:21.427 --> 24:24.583
Yeah. Keep telling yourself that,
baby girl.

24:37.586 --> 24:38.940
You mind if I come in?

24:38.977 --> 24:40.261
- Yeah, yeah.
- Thank you.

24:40.855 --> 24:42.692
So, you talked to Molly.

24:42.726 --> 24:44.463
Yeah.

24:44.915 --> 24:47.262
What can I say,
I'm a sucker for a pretty face.

24:47.286 --> 24:49.860
- Here I thought you were hard to get.
- I'm not hard to get.

24:50.746 --> 24:52.942
Hmm, not hard to get, just hard to keep.

24:57.517 --> 24:59.441
I'm glad you and Jenny worked it all out.

24:59.477 --> 25:01.323
Me too. I totally love her.

25:31.606 --> 25:33.303
We made a campfire.

25:36.558 --> 25:38.302
What you're thinking about?

25:40.527 --> 25:44.640
I was just, uh, I was just thinking
about how crazy it is to

25:44.687 --> 25:47.781
- see old friends, you know?
- Yeah.

25:47.825 --> 25:48.940
Yeah.

25:48.946 --> 25:50.392
Yeah.

25:51.035 --> 25:53.170
It hears like a long life time ago.

25:55.006 --> 25:57.971
Then, it was all about the military.

25:59.757 --> 26:02.771
And now,
I don't know what the hell it's about.

26:05.035 --> 26:08.373
You just need to give yourself time
to adjust, you know?

26:08.406 --> 26:09.921
Figure things out.

26:18.536 --> 26:21.302
Okay. What do you want to happen?

26:21.347 --> 26:23.091
With what? When?

26:23.136 --> 26:25.302
Like, in the future.
I mean, do you want kids?

26:25.337 --> 26:29.130
Do you want to stay in L.A.? I mean,
what would be your ultimate career?

26:29.176 --> 26:30.991
God, um...

26:31.488 --> 26:34.533
- Just questions.
- Just little questions.

26:38.526 --> 26:40.720
I, I guess...

26:40.755 --> 26:44.541
I guess I want kids. Eventually.
But not now,

26:45.528 --> 26:47.200
I don't think.

26:47.248 --> 26:50.812
And, you know,
I'm really excited about this TV show,

26:50.816 --> 26:54.143
if I get the job. I really like it up there,
you know? It's exciting.

26:54.185 --> 26:55.240
Yeah.

26:56.896 --> 26:58.502
Why, what do you want?

27:00.226 --> 27:02.243
I want to be with you.

27:05.215 --> 27:07.312
Let's move in together.

27:09.686 --> 27:11.173
Really?

27:12.098 --> 27:13.610
Yeah.

27:14.568 --> 27:15.970
Okay.

27:17.015 --> 27:20.903
Yeah, let's do it! Why not?
You're so serious...

27:22.578 --> 27:24.590
This is serious stuff.

27:25.038 --> 27:26.822
Don't you think?

27:29.507 --> 27:31.482
I'm not leaving you alone
in the tent anymore!

27:33.037 --> 27:35.190
We're supposed to be making s'mores.

27:36.575 --> 27:38.312
I just don't like being...

27:50.057 --> 27:51.412
Are you hungry, doll?

27:52.277 --> 27:53.470
Yeah.

27:53.515 --> 27:54.940
Yeah?

27:55.675 --> 27:57.071
You wanna go?

27:57.105 --> 28:00.322
- Somewhere else? Yeah, I do.
- I wanna go. Yeah, let's go.

28:02.125 --> 28:03.561
You wanna eat that?

28:03.605 --> 28:05.143
No, thank you.

28:05.986 --> 28:07.602
It's not gonna hurt.

28:10.037 --> 28:11.523
That's so cool!

28:21.425 --> 28:23.280
There's too much chocolate!

28:30.056 --> 28:32.523
Oh man... Are you serious?

28:32.545 --> 28:35.351
I bribed the side-driver
to give us a little privacy.

28:35.387 --> 28:37.812
'Cause your rent tent sucks.

28:37.906 --> 28:39.950
- Hey, hey, hey, I tried.
- I know.

28:39.986 --> 28:41.310
It just didn't go very well.

28:41.358 --> 28:43.581
Not hard enough, obviously.

29:42.275 --> 29:43.632
Is that good?

29:46.186 --> 29:47.993
Yeah.

30:14.088 --> 30:16.633
Any hot tips?

30:21.106 --> 30:23.131
Breathe through your mouth.

30:23.177 --> 30:25.250
- Really?
- Really.

30:44.465 --> 30:45.880
Here it is.

30:45.926 --> 30:47.360
You bought me a present?

30:47.727 --> 30:50.051
I'm gonna document this moment.

30:50.096 --> 30:51.663
Okay. Here we go.

30:54.486 --> 30:58.132
It's a present for both of us.

31:02.578 --> 31:04.061
What do you think?

31:06.546 --> 31:09.141
That's not the reaction I wanted to elicit.

31:09.187 --> 31:11.902
- Jenny, it's a purple penis.
- Yeah!

31:13.887 --> 31:16.481
What am I supposed to do with this?
I'm not a dude.

31:16.496 --> 31:17.880
It's fun!

31:17.916 --> 31:20.221
- Have you ever used...
- I know that's a fake dick!

31:20.226 --> 31:22.312
- Jenny, I know, I mean...
- I know, but what's that?

31:22.356 --> 31:26.142
You're gonna strap me
in this fabulous western harnest?

31:26.177 --> 31:27.541
Listen,

31:27.588 --> 31:29.810
- do you like to fuck me?
- A lot.

31:29.858 --> 31:33.471
So, you're just gonna fuck me
with that.

31:34.855 --> 31:36.123
Okay then.

31:36.166 --> 31:39.321
- Give me the camera back. I'm directing.
- What?!

31:39.367 --> 31:41.531
- Yep.
- I'm scared about your idea.

31:41.588 --> 31:42.733
Really?

31:42.765 --> 31:46.023
- I'm going to make a movie.
- You are?

31:46.055 --> 31:47.962
This is my stage.

31:47.987 --> 31:50.483
- What do you want me to do?
- I want you first

31:50.588 --> 31:52.303
to take off your pants.

31:54.766 --> 31:56.380
Spank you!

31:57.568 --> 31:59.973
- Now, it's so bad of you.
- Do you think that is?

32:00.018 --> 32:01.492
Actually, that's not gonna
get you the job, so

32:01.517 --> 32:03.801
you're gonna take... Oh, that's much better.

32:03.827 --> 32:06.331
- You like that?
- I do. Now, take off the bra.

32:07.007 --> 32:08.732
- "Just Like Heaven" by The Cure -

32:11.296 --> 32:13.031
You're so beautiful.

32:13.077 --> 32:15.352
You're beautiful.

32:15.397 --> 32:17.523
Think about to stilettos, my love.

32:17.565 --> 32:20.220
Oh yes. The stilettos on!

32:20.268 --> 32:21.543
Fuck!

32:43.965 --> 32:45.223
Yes!

32:45.267 --> 32:47.601
Am I professional here?

32:48.425 --> 32:52.422
There we go. Now,
you look like a director.

32:52.457 --> 32:54.490
Now, I'm in the business, young lady.

32:54.537 --> 32:56.783
Take off your pants. That's the only way

32:56.826 --> 32:59.311
you're going to get your actors
to listen to you.

32:59.356 --> 33:03.451
Now, we go back to acting.
Give me this.

33:17.595 --> 33:19.591
You ???

33:21.586 --> 33:23.001
Now,

33:23.926 --> 33:25.841
I have something for you.

33:26.438 --> 33:27.803
Just...

33:27.848 --> 33:29.622
Here you go.

33:31.045 --> 33:33.293
I feel like I'm about
to get you up.

33:35.697 --> 33:37.020
Lub!

33:37.927 --> 33:40.002
- No, no, Jenny!
- What?

33:40.035 --> 33:41.221
Don't!

33:41.267 --> 33:42.320
What?!

33:43.355 --> 33:44.411
Now...

33:46.856 --> 33:48.953
I think it's hard.

33:51.187 --> 33:52.330
Come here.

34:03.925 --> 34:06.161
I feel like I have a ???

34:15.067 --> 34:17.000
I love you.

34:18.534 --> 34:20.751
I love you so much.

34:20.797 --> 34:22.420
I wanna fuck you.

34:24.396 --> 34:26.351
How are you gonna fuck me?

34:27.536 --> 34:29.601
- Like a man.
- Hard?

34:31.018 --> 34:33.972
- So put yourself inside of me.
- Okay.

34:35.038 --> 34:36.862
You can tell me where I need to be ok?

34:36.876 --> 34:39.429
- Okay.
- Thank you. Can't feel what I'm doing!

34:39.466 --> 34:41.112
- You'll go with that.
- Yeah?

34:41.147 --> 34:42.469
Yeah.

34:43.777 --> 34:46.232
??? you, ???
if you are still wet.

34:46.266 --> 34:47.803
I mean, I'm still wet.

34:50.656 --> 34:53.571
- Harder.
- Harder.

34:53.608 --> 34:54.452
Yeah.

34:56.178 --> 34:57.971
I love you fucking me.

35:00.516 --> 35:02.030
I love you.

35:21.986 --> 35:24.410
I give you an A+.

35:24.447 --> 35:26.171
Thank you.

35:26.208 --> 35:28.692
Will you come visit me
when I go back to school?

35:28.728 --> 35:30.432
Maybe.

35:30.468 --> 35:32.623
I don't like the cold, though.

35:32.626 --> 35:34.290
I'll keep you warm.

35:36.748 --> 35:39.170
So what is it? What kinda law
is that that you study?

35:39.205 --> 35:41.011
I wanna be a public defender.

35:41.048 --> 35:43.530
It's not glamourous,
the money sucks, but

35:43.575 --> 35:46.532
I think the only way to really affect change
is person to person.

35:46.578 --> 35:48.473
So you wanna defend the little guy?

35:48.988 --> 35:50.453
Somebody has to.

35:50.487 --> 35:53.003
I would never expect that from you.

35:53.048 --> 35:55.230
I'm full of surprises.

35:57.716 --> 35:59.512
I bet you are.

36:01.856 --> 36:03.352
- "Skin To Skin" by Standfast -

36:03.417 --> 36:04.653
Oh, fuck!

36:12.515 --> 36:13.881
What do you want me to do?

36:13.925 --> 36:15.622
I don't want you to come yet.

36:35.277 --> 36:36.760
I want you to come here!

36:56.568 --> 36:58.280
That was fun.

36:59.775 --> 37:01.712
- Ghost story?
- Ghost story.

37:01.755 --> 37:03.350
- Ghost story.
- I know one.

37:03.618 --> 37:06.281
Okay. There was this guy,
he's, he's a regular guy.

37:06.317 --> 37:08.870
He's a banker, or maybe
he's an add guy.

37:08.927 --> 37:12.382
Doesn't matter. Forget it.
He's stressed out. That's the important thing.

37:12.418 --> 37:14.191
So he decides to

37:14.238 --> 37:15.841
get a cabin in the woods

37:15.886 --> 37:19.023
- by himself for the weekend.
- Why do white people always do that?

37:19.056 --> 37:22.020
Especially when they know some crazy
spooky shit is gonna happen to them.

37:22.065 --> 37:25.373
Okay. So he, um,
he packs his SUV,

37:25.408 --> 37:27.600
he brings things for work, like,

37:27.636 --> 37:31.011
work stuff and then he brings books
and he brings

37:31.056 --> 37:34.522
his dog, a golden retriever, and
he starts driving up to the mountains.

37:34.567 --> 37:37.200
When he's driving,
he hears on the radio

37:37.205 --> 37:38.991
that an inmate has escaped

37:39.025 --> 37:41.312
- from a local insane asylum.
- That's bullshit.

37:41.417 --> 37:44.263
You are not telling a homicidal-maniac-escapes-
from-the-insane-asylum story.

37:44.306 --> 37:46.132
- You're not.
- Just wait for it. Just wait.

37:46.168 --> 37:48.132
So he hears this news,
he doesn't care.

37:48.178 --> 37:50.123
Whatever. He just wants to go relax.

37:50.155 --> 37:52.793
He has a fantastic day at the cabin,

37:52.826 --> 37:55.791
there are also such adventurous things.

37:55.827 --> 37:58.042
And at night he's exhausted.

37:58.086 --> 38:00.962
So he passes out on the couch.
He's reading a book,

38:01.007 --> 38:02.011
He's gone.

38:02.047 --> 38:03.990
In the middle of the night,
he wakes up.

38:04.027 --> 38:06.822
He hears this really weird sound,
just like,

38:06.867 --> 38:07.971
"drip",

38:08.006 --> 38:09.543
"drip",

38:09.577 --> 38:10.750
"drip".

38:11.338 --> 38:13.433
He's too tired to get up
and see what it is.

38:13.466 --> 38:15.733
So, he calls his dog over,

38:15.777 --> 38:17.522
his dog leaks his hand,

38:17.555 --> 38:20.900
he feels better, he feels comfort
and he falls back to sleep.

38:20.938 --> 38:22.553
A couple of hours later,

38:23.018 --> 38:25.870
he hears the same sound.
He wakes up and is like,

38:25.908 --> 38:27.493
there is the dripping.

38:27.538 --> 38:29.070
Again. "Drip".

38:30.947 --> 38:33.093
But he's still way too tired
to get up.

38:33.188 --> 38:35.570
The dog comes over,
he leaks his hand,

38:35.618 --> 38:36.980
he feels better,

38:37.015 --> 38:38.440
falls back asleep.

38:38.486 --> 38:40.751
And that's morning,
the sun comes up.

38:40.788 --> 38:44.001
It's very bright in the room.
He looks over,

38:44.046 --> 38:47.233
he sees a giant pull of blood.

38:48.008 --> 38:51.643
He starts screaming, he looks up,
his dog, the golden retriever,

38:51.647 --> 38:55.093
is empaled by the chandelier,
hanging from above.

38:55.126 --> 38:57.841
The blood is gushing down, dripping.

38:57.917 --> 38:59.443
There's the "drip" sound.

38:59.487 --> 39:02.310
He looks over,
and there's a little note.

39:02.355 --> 39:04.770
Fix it up, it's written in blood.

39:04.815 --> 39:06.581
And he reads:

39:06.626 --> 39:08.770
"People can leak too".

39:08.815 --> 39:10.621
You know it's good.

39:11.937 --> 39:13.963
- 'Cause everybody knows.
- It's good.

39:14.007 --> 39:18.243
It's true. No, it's actually a true story.
My grandmother told us that story.

39:18.278 --> 39:19.641
No, it's not.

39:19.678 --> 39:21.172
It's not scary.

39:27.366 --> 39:29.510
That's so stupid!

39:31.198 --> 39:33.451
Stupid, stupid, stupid.

39:33.486 --> 39:36.122
I tried. It seemed funny
when I bought it.

39:36.128 --> 39:37.903
You got it at the 99 cents store?

39:37.937 --> 39:39.973
And a few other special things.

39:39.975 --> 39:42.873
- What took you long enough?
- And up noise.

39:44.186 --> 39:46.182
How old are we? 12?

39:46.217 --> 39:48.520
- Guys, let play a game.
- You're lucky to get in.

39:48.576 --> 39:50.053
- Yes!
- Yeah, let's play "Truth or Dare".

39:50.067 --> 39:51.723
- Totally, yes, yes, yes!
- No, no, no.

39:51.766 --> 39:53.823
Oh come on!
"Truth or Dare" is so awesome!

39:53.858 --> 39:55.371
It always ends up
running around naked and...

39:55.408 --> 39:58.592
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I got one, I got one.
Why don't we play "I Never"?

39:58.678 --> 40:01.272
- Oh, that is good. Yeah, let's play that.
- How do you play it?

40:01.317 --> 40:03.900
You run a circle and you start
with the statement "I Never", like, uh,

40:03.946 --> 40:06.501
I've never eaten potato chips,

40:06.547 --> 40:08.333
okay? And then, if you have,
you drink.

40:08.365 --> 40:10.220
- So, it's the other person that speaks.
- Right, but you do things less lame

40:10.256 --> 40:12.742
- than ate a potato chip.
- Oh, yeah, obviously. Shut up.

40:12.787 --> 40:15.643
Yeah, okay, okay, okay,
I'll go first. I'll go first. Um...

40:17.328 --> 40:18.972
I have never

40:18.978 --> 40:20.750
slept with a girl.

40:20.797 --> 40:22.942
- And then you drink, if you...
- So you drink

40:22.987 --> 40:24.532
when it's the opposite.

40:29.056 --> 40:32.341
Adele, I knew it.
You do sleep with other girls.

40:32.415 --> 40:34.683
- I do.
- Girls, huh?

40:34.715 --> 40:36.343
What?

40:36.378 --> 40:39.300
- I said maybe.
- Okay, go. Adele, go.

40:39.335 --> 40:40.531
Your turn.

40:40.576 --> 40:43.841
I never lied about
who I'm sleeping with.

40:54.035 --> 40:56.841
- You?
- Well, I did that one time.

40:56.876 --> 40:59.683
- Oh, Henry. Yes.
- Remember that? Yeah, don't remind me.

41:00.507 --> 41:03.872
Okay. Come on, lesbos, let's up this.
This is lame.

41:03.918 --> 41:06.563
- Fuck yeah.
- Yeah, they're getting boring.

41:06.598 --> 41:07.961
Alright, Tina. Go.

41:09.508 --> 41:13.541
- I've never had sex in a public place.
- Would somebody bring me a bucket?

41:16.095 --> 41:19.403
Wait, wait, wait. What constitutes public?
Like a bathroom stall?

41:19.405 --> 41:21.293
Nothing with a door counts. Like,

41:21.387 --> 41:23.900
not a bathroom ???

41:23.936 --> 41:25.102
What? Ah!

41:25.765 --> 41:28.143
- I did it in a car.
- Jenny, you go.

41:30.168 --> 41:32.160
- I'm just getting drunk, right?
- Yeah!

41:32.956 --> 41:34.403
How about

41:34.945 --> 41:36.671
I've never been in love.

41:43.956 --> 41:45.630
I'm sure there's ??? in here.

41:48.745 --> 41:51.062
Hey, listen. A reaction from the group.

41:54.506 --> 41:56.460
- You've never been in love?
- Who's next?

41:56.495 --> 41:58.753
- Alright, um...
- I don't think so.
- Can I go?

41:58.797 --> 42:00.871
Maybe I have,
but I'm not really sure what that is.

42:01.038 --> 42:02.090
- Okay, go.
- Yeah.

42:02.138 --> 42:04.213
Okay. I never

42:04.245 --> 42:06.560
cheated on a girlfriend.

42:12.878 --> 42:15.083
Who did you cheat on?

42:15.096 --> 42:16.382
Michelle.

42:16.425 --> 42:18.020
The one...?

42:18.066 --> 42:21.323
Yeah. I kissed another girl

42:21.355 --> 42:24.560
- while I was going out with my first girlfriend.
- Bette, you did it.

42:24.605 --> 42:26.943
Kissing isn't like cheating, cheating.
It's not, you know.

42:26.947 --> 42:28.670
- Yes, it is.
- Kissing is cheating.

42:28.705 --> 42:31.192
- Look... yeah.
- Totally cheating. Kissing?

42:31.225 --> 42:32.330
- It totally is.
- Yeah!

42:32.366 --> 42:33.882
- No.
- I don't know.

42:33.916 --> 42:36.021
Jodi's signing.
I think it depends on

42:36.057 --> 42:38.360
the agreement between the people
in the relationship.

42:38.407 --> 42:39.780
I don't want the rules making,
you know,

42:39.787 --> 42:41.902
judgements on what I should do
in my relationship.

42:41.946 --> 42:44.973
But nobody likes to be fucked around
like behind their back.

42:46.158 --> 42:49.192
I don't know. I don't think kissing counts.
It's not cheating.

42:49.226 --> 42:51.210
Nor do I think sleeping with someone.

42:51.216 --> 42:52.481
Fucking?!

42:52.528 --> 42:54.251
Well, you know, unless you sleep
with a person more than once,

42:54.285 --> 42:55.443
- then I...
- More than once?

42:55.476 --> 42:57.560
Oh my God, that is so stupid!

43:01.555 --> 43:04.253
- Not in my book. It's not.
- No, I agree with Shane.

43:04.285 --> 43:06.703
I mean, messing around
is just messing around, right?

43:06.747 --> 43:09.400
I mean, you can still behold someone
in your heart and...

43:09.437 --> 43:11.350
- I mean, what's the big deal?
- Right.

43:11.395 --> 43:13.603
Wow, you guys have great morals.

43:14.518 --> 43:15.843
Yeah.

43:16.088 --> 43:18.123
I agree with Jodi.

43:18.156 --> 43:22.502
I think that it depends on
your agreement as a couple,

43:22.546 --> 43:25.461
so if you guys say that
you're in a monogamist relationship,

43:25.497 --> 43:27.930
then you're in a monogamist relationship.
And I think that,

43:27.976 --> 43:30.951
if you're in an open relationship,
then you're in an open one.

43:30.987 --> 43:32.573
Like when you cheated on me with Claude?

43:34.547 --> 43:36.183
Who's Claude?

43:36.186 --> 43:38.481
- A french girl.
- We were broken up.

43:38.515 --> 43:40.303
- What?!
- I don't wanna...

43:40.336 --> 43:42.581
- Anyways.
- I don't know. I think

43:42.615 --> 43:45.172
sexual jealousy always
ways down a relationship.

43:45.206 --> 43:46.791
That's because you're a ho.

43:46.825 --> 43:48.240
I ain't a ho, bitch!

43:49.545 --> 43:51.790
- Kinda.
- Don't you go projecting.

43:52.927 --> 43:56.171
So, does that mean that I could sleep with
any one of your friends and you wouldn't care?

43:56.205 --> 43:59.013
Not if you came home with me afterwards.

43:59.048 --> 44:00.521
- Really?!
- Smile.

44:00.556 --> 44:01.772
- No.
- Let me see...

44:04.026 --> 44:06.700
Oh my God, you guys are on crack,
like,

44:07.285 --> 44:09.763
fucking is cheating, kissing is cheating.

44:09.796 --> 44:13.001
Whether you do it 40 times or once,
it's cheating.

44:13.046 --> 44:14.631
- I agree. Yeah.
- Come on!

44:14.676 --> 44:16.472
- Crazy people!
- Yeah.

44:16.477 --> 44:18.453
- Cheating!
- And thinking is cheating.

44:18.486 --> 44:21.131
- Oh my God!
- Thinking?

44:21.166 --> 44:23.653
- Thinking?
- What? Yes! If you're thinking about

44:23.686 --> 44:25.980
having sex with somebody
besides your partner,

44:26.027 --> 44:29.291
flirting with, then that's intimacy
you're giving somebody else.

44:29.327 --> 44:31.931
- Oh my God!
- Besides your partner, it's cheating. What?!

44:31.935 --> 44:33.630
Flirting is cheating... Oh my God!

44:33.676 --> 44:35.581
Okay. What about...

44:36.588 --> 44:40.471
Okay. Who here, put up your hand,
thinks that kissing is cheating?

44:41.155 --> 44:42.571
No, I don't.

44:43.517 --> 44:46.671
Well, if thinking is cheating,
then kissing is definitively cheating.

44:46.708 --> 44:48.162
Yeah, I think it's a cheat.

44:48.196 --> 44:49.572
Definitively.

44:52.926 --> 44:55.640
Bette, what do you think?
You didn't raise your hand.

44:55.685 --> 44:58.880
I don't know. I just,
I think it's a trap to judge.

44:58.925 --> 45:00.561
I mean, I think there are

45:00.606 --> 45:03.813
different situations, and you can't really

45:03.815 --> 45:06.471
- categorically...
- Oh, my God, that is such a non-answer.

45:06.518 --> 45:10.140
That's Bette...
because she was a big ol' cheater.

45:10.848 --> 45:13.542
- Oh, give her a break. Come on.
- I'm not...

45:13.598 --> 45:16.230
- I'm not judging.
- You know what? Who's got the next "I Never"?

45:16.267 --> 45:17.681
Yeah. Who's got the next one?
Let's just...

45:17.715 --> 45:20.733
Bette, come on. I mean, you cheat.
You were a giant cheater.

45:20.816 --> 45:23.010
I'm not... It was a phase;
I'm not saying you are now. But, like,

45:23.046 --> 45:25.790
you cheated on Tina, you cheated on me,
I mean... you cheated.

45:25.836 --> 45:28.632
There was...
There was a lot of cheating.

45:29.227 --> 45:32.710
Right? You guys, come on!
You saw it. You were there.

45:32.746 --> 45:36.453
She was ??? Baboom!
Ginormous cheater.

45:36.496 --> 45:38.122
Okay. Leave me alone. Sorry.

45:38.846 --> 45:40.243
Were you?

45:42.515 --> 45:44.293
Are you cheating on me?

45:52.588 --> 45:54.651
Tina, where are you going?

46:00.957 --> 46:02.031
What?

46:23.086 --> 46:24.351
Fuck, fuck!

46:31.517 --> 46:33.330
What the fuck just happened?

46:36.065 --> 46:38.351
- Did I say s... I was kidding.
- No.

46:53.855 --> 46:56.403
Fuck! Jodi?

47:06.328 --> 47:08.482
She doesn't wanna see you, Bette.

47:08.518 --> 47:11.073
She wants you to go away.

47:25.686 --> 47:27.132
Fuck...

47:28.508 --> 47:30.072
Tina?

47:30.557 --> 47:33.260
- What the fuck?
- What's going on?

47:35.495 --> 47:36.890
I don't wanna talk about it.

47:36.938 --> 47:39.022
Are you having an affair with Bette?

47:39.055 --> 47:40.770
Since when?

47:40.808 --> 47:43.721
- Maybe a month.
- A month?!

47:43.765 --> 47:46.063
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Because you have a big mouth.

47:46.095 --> 47:47.412
Shit.

47:51.287 --> 47:54.180
- Are you guys getting back together?
- I don't know; I don't know.

47:54.226 --> 47:55.940
I don't know what the fuck we're doing.

47:57.945 --> 47:59.690
This is fucking crazy.

47:59.727 --> 48:02.983
- Crazy.
- I never saw this coming.

48:03.015 --> 48:03.990
Ever.

48:07.288 --> 48:09.921
What the fuck!
What the fuck is wrong with you?!

48:09.968 --> 48:11.713
I don't know. It just happened.

48:11.748 --> 48:13.521
Such things don't just happen!
I mean,

48:13.526 --> 48:15.732
you don't wait for somebody
by accident!

48:15.818 --> 48:17.362
- Did you forget?
- Forget what?

48:17.406 --> 48:19.151
How terrible
your relationship with Tina was?

48:19.195 --> 48:21.472
I mean, you were miserable.
You hated each other!

48:21.518 --> 48:22.883
You hated each other.

48:25.796 --> 48:29.170
Okay. Maybe, I don't know, maybe
the sex is totally making you mad.

48:29.206 --> 48:32.232
I don't know. You know,
you and Jodi had this wonderful shot,

48:32.268 --> 48:34.980
- some really, really healthy and good together.
- No, we didn't.

48:35.015 --> 48:38.081
- And you fucked it up!
- Jodi and I never had a shot.

48:38.165 --> 48:40.323
We didn't. It wasn't working.

48:45.047 --> 48:47.152
I love Tina.

48:48.367 --> 48:50.710
I've always loved Tina.

48:54.008 --> 48:57.011
Yeah, this turned out so badly.
I didn't mean it

48:57.056 --> 48:58.583
to happen this way.

49:00.525 --> 49:04.493
I know that I'm going about it all wrong,
but I'm doing it for the right reasons.

49:04.527 --> 49:06.303
I was trying to do the right thing

49:10.227 --> 49:13.763
Yeah, well, you know, it sounds like
you're doing what's right for Bette.

49:13.818 --> 49:16.590
You know, it's what what's right
for Bette.

49:20.427 --> 49:22.743
Jodi is going to be devastated.

49:22.785 --> 49:25.391
She moved her whole life out here
to be with Bette.

49:25.486 --> 49:27.090
I'm not trying to guilt-trip you, T.,
I swear.

49:27.137 --> 49:30.101
I didn't want it to happen this way, okay?
I didn't even want to come

49:30.137 --> 49:33.242
- on this trip. I didn't want it to happen...
- Are you in love with Bette?

49:34.008 --> 49:35.113
Again?

49:37.506 --> 49:39.561
I've always been in love with her.

49:39.565 --> 49:43.032
And I feel like an asshole
that I'm doing this to Jodi, but

49:43.076 --> 49:44.890
I just want her back.

49:44.926 --> 49:47.892
And I'm scared,
'cause I know we're just going to, like,

49:48.595 --> 49:50.763
probably fuck it up, but I have to do it,

49:50.807 --> 49:53.591
you know? I can't help it.
It's something that I can't help.

49:53.626 --> 49:55.492
- I want to be with her.
- Okay.

49:58.816 --> 50:00.503
You guys, you know...

50:00.547 --> 50:02.291
you belong together.

50:03.055 --> 50:04.500
Yep. You do.

50:05.255 --> 50:06.781
You always have.

50:07.645 --> 50:09.030
It's true.

50:09.517 --> 50:11.601
I fucking hate women.

50:12.676 --> 50:14.550
Yeah. Well.

50:18.015 --> 50:20.722
That's some fucked up shit, Tina.

50:33.297 --> 50:34.882
Dramarama.

50:37.227 --> 50:39.300
It's so typical.

50:42.678 --> 50:45.342
Bette and Tina should have stayed together.

50:47.085 --> 50:50.063
They should have found the courage
to work it out.

50:50.095 --> 50:53.721
Instead of just running away
from each other like that.

50:56.718 --> 51:00.252
Fuck! That's really
wrecking all this fucking havoc!

51:05.386 --> 51:07.620
Well, we came back to each other.

51:07.667 --> 51:10.733
- Yeah.
- That's all that matters.

51:12.046 --> 51:14.490
Well, I'm in no position to judge.

51:14.536 --> 51:17.012
Love makes people so insane.

51:19.598 --> 51:22.952
Do you know that my friends think
I'm out of my mind,

51:23.835 --> 51:26.001
for falling in love with you?

51:26.048 --> 51:28.341
They don't know us.

51:29.478 --> 51:31.241
We're different, Jenny.

51:36.406 --> 51:38.742
Do you think that
this is going to be one of those

51:39.777 --> 51:41.652
movie things.

51:43.425 --> 51:45.771
Or do you think
that we're actually going to make it.

51:49.558 --> 51:51.200
We're going to make it.

51:53.848 --> 51:55.821
And I'm going to love you.

51:56.596 --> 51:58.230
Forever.

52:04.488 --> 52:05.872
I promise.

53:09.237 --> 53:12.023
- "The Other Side" by Rachael Yamagata -

54:13.346 --> 54:14.931
They left already.

54:16.856 --> 54:18.601
Jodi wanted to ride home alone.

54:19.305 --> 54:25.196
