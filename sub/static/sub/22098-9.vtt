Nice shot.

(ALARM SOUNDING)

17:56.284 --> 17:57.784
The environmental
computer decided

17:57.869 --> 17:59.870
that the firing range
was over pressurized

17:59.954 --> 18:01.872
and started bleeding
out air to compensate.

18:01.956 --> 18:03.540

we may have been dead.

Equipment failures.

18:07.587 --> 18:10.130
Sir, I think I've
found what's causing it.

18:11.549 --> 18:13.842
What is that?
BALTAR: A Cylon logic bomb.

18:14.677 --> 18:16.511
A heuristic
computer virus.

18:18.014 --> 18:20.098
It's capable of
learning, evolving.

18:20.183 --> 18:21.683
It's probably
running in parallel

18:21.768 --> 18:22.851
with every computer
in the ship right now,

18:22.935 --> 18:24.895
just waiting
to be activated.

18:25.730 --> 18:28.023
No doubt left behind

the day you
were shot, sir.

18:33.696 --> 18:35.363
That was weeks ago.

18:36.741 --> 18:37.949
Why now?

18:38.034 --> 18:39.659
Most likely, sir,
it took that long

18:39.744 --> 18:42.120
for it to crack our
encrypted pass-codes.

18:42.205 --> 18:44.498
And once that happened,
it started testing

18:44.582 --> 18:46.208
its ability to
control our systems.

Well, that's
the tricky part.

18:53.132 --> 18:57.844
If it's a Cylon virus, it is
extremely difficult to eradicate.

18:58.387 --> 19:00.889

pretty lucky then.

its course in a matter of hours.

will be on top of us.

on his flight deck.

25:39.955 --> 25:41.623

but I told him

25:41.707 --> 25:44.834
that I would have a crew in there
to haul them out as soon as possible.

that this is a prelude

26:42.351 --> 26:44.769
to an all-out
attack by the Cylons.

26:55.739 --> 26:58.074
I assume you've
tried to disable it.

Mr. Gaeta and the Vice President
are handling that right now.

27:01.996 --> 27:03.788

what I can offer you here

27:05.833 --> 27:07.709
besides my
moral support.

27:08.669 --> 27:10.503
Actually, Madam President,

27:11.880 --> 27:13.673
I could use your advice.

27:14.216 --> 27:16.009
You want to what?

27:16.093 --> 27:18.011
Completely erase
our computer drives,

27:18.095 --> 27:19.679
cold restart the
entire ship's system

27:19.763 --> 27:21.639
and then restore them
using our prewar backups.

down until we're back online.

27:24.560 --> 27:26.477

will never go for this.

27:26.562 --> 27:27.603
I've already
spoken to him, sir.

27:27.688 --> 27:29.480
What did he say?
He's considering it.

27:29.565 --> 27:31.649
It's the only way
to destroy the virus.

27:31.734 --> 27:33.234
I thought the Commander
told you to stay out of this.

27:33.319 --> 27:35.069
I'm sorry, do you want
to survive this one or not?

27:35.154 --> 27:37.113
All right, so we calculate a jump and

27:37.197 --> 27:39.657
get some distance on
these Cylon bastards...

27:39.742 --> 27:41.993
No, sir,
we can't risk a jump.

27:42.077 --> 27:44.412
All of our systems are
compromised, including navigation.

27:44.496 --> 27:46.164
The virus could drop us
in the middle of a sun.

27:46.248 --> 27:47.623
We're running out of time.

27:47.708 --> 27:49.500
Our signal's gonna catch
up with the Cylon fleet.

27:49.585 --> 27:52.045
If we haven't come up
with anything before then...

27:52.129 --> 27:54.172
They'll take control
of all of our systems

27:54.256 --> 27:56.299
and then they'll have
a hundred ways to kill us.

27:56.383 --> 28:01.095
I've just come from
seeing our Cylon prisoner.

28:01.972 --> 28:05.266
She's offering a possible
solution to the problem.

28:06.602 --> 28:08.519
And you're wondering
if you can trust her.

28:08.604 --> 28:10.730
It took
everything I have

28:11.607 --> 28:14.692
not to put my hands around her throat.

28:16.528 --> 28:19.238
I can't believe
I'm contemplating this.

28:19.323 --> 28:22.325
We both know the Cylons
are experts at manipulation.

28:22.409 --> 28:25.244
They will do anything
to confuse you.

28:25.913 --> 28:28.039
This is not the
one who shot me.

28:28.123 --> 28:31.042
Can they really be that
different from one another?

28:33.128 --> 28:34.462
Commander,
if you're asking me

28:34.546 --> 28:37.924
if it's possible that your
judgment's been clouded,

28:38.008 --> 28:40.051
by your history with this
particular Cylon model,

28:40.135 --> 28:41.677
I'd have to say yes.

28:42.346 --> 28:43.721
But

28:45.891 --> 28:47.392
we created them.

28:49.061 --> 28:52.647
There's always a chance
we might find common ground.

28:56.860 --> 28:58.861
(MAN CHATTERING ON RADIO)

29:44.491 --> 29:45.575
We need to
work quickly.

29:45.659 --> 29:46.868
We're on
borrowed time.

29:54.877 --> 29:56.252
Let her go.
