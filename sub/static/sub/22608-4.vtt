00:33.820 --> 00:37.260
The Cape of Good Hope,
on Africa's southerly tip.

00:38.900 --> 00:43.739
Here, two great seas meet.
One, the warm Indian Ocean,

00:43.740 --> 00:45.980
the other, the chilly Atlantic.

00:50.940 --> 00:53.818
And as they mingle,
so they create a billowing cloak

00:53.819 --> 00:56.540
that drapes the summit
of Table Mountain.

01:06.940 --> 01:10.580
Spectacular though this is,
the mountain's cloudy covering

01:10.581 --> 01:13.459
is only a hint of the
profound influence

01:13.460 --> 01:17.660
that these two very different oceans
have on the fortunes of life here.

01:31.500 --> 01:33.498
And not just here at the Cape,

01:33.499 --> 01:36.540
but across the length and breadth
of southern Africa.

01:51.820 --> 01:54.540
Two thousand miles
north from the Cape,

01:54.541 --> 01:58.900
beneath this sandy beach,
new life is stirring.

02:15.140 --> 02:17.419
Hundreds of baby green turtles

02:17.420 --> 02:20.660
emerge like a torrent from
the safety of their nest.

02:39.180 --> 02:42.219
Each one, just seven
centimetres long,

02:42.220 --> 02:45.100
must make a hundred-metre
sprint down the beach.

02:57.700 --> 02:59.058
From the moment they hatch,

02:59.059 --> 03:02.540
they're driven by an instinctive
urge to run to the sea.

03:15.900 --> 03:18.698
Few creatures start life with
the odds for success

03:18.699 --> 03:20.540
so heavily stacked against them.

03:29.340 --> 03:30.620
Yellow-billed kites.

03:35.780 --> 03:36.820
Pied crows.

03:41.500 --> 03:44.178
But so many of these hatchlings
appear together,

03:44.179 --> 03:46.300
that predators can't catch them all.

04:00.620 --> 04:02.940
Last out,
this baby might seem doomed.

04:09.740 --> 04:12.700
But struggling out late could just
give her a chance.

04:22.940 --> 04:24.420
The crows seem insatiable.

04:34.140 --> 04:37.940
Even those that reach
the sea aren't safe.

04:40.620 --> 04:42.620
This female has to make a dash
for it.

04:54.220 --> 04:56.700
She's still in danger,
and not just from above.

05:07.020 --> 05:09.738
A ghost crab may be smaller
than the hatchling,

05:09.739 --> 05:12.260
but it has the strength to drag
her into its lair.

05:30.540 --> 05:31.580
Not this time.

05:45.580 --> 05:47.020
At last, the sea.

05:58.100 --> 06:00.818
She has to catch a breath
if she's not to drown,

06:00.819 --> 06:03.860
but the pounding waves make it
desperately difficult.

06:33.740 --> 06:35.740
Beyond the surf, calmer water,

06:36.860 --> 06:39.620
but even here, the hatchling
is not out of danger.

06:54.700 --> 06:55.860
She dives.

06:58.740 --> 06:59.940
Just in time.

07:22.100 --> 07:25.740
Only one hatchling in a thousand
will survive to adulthood,

07:27.420 --> 07:30.860
but if she does,
she may live for 80 years.

07:37.780 --> 07:40.580
For now,
the ocean is there to be explored.

07:52.180 --> 07:55.380
As the hatchling
disappears into the deep blue,

07:55.381 --> 08:00.259
she swims into the waters of one
the planet's most powerful currents.

08:00.260 --> 08:01.460
The Agulhas.

08:06.300 --> 08:09.459
The Agulhas sweeps south
towards the Cape,

08:09.460 --> 08:13.260
transporting a hundred billion
gallons of warm water every day.

08:17.020 --> 08:21.860
These tropical seas are so warm,
they evaporate on an enormous scale.

08:24.260 --> 08:27.059
Water vapour rises until,
at altitude,

08:27.060 --> 08:30.060
it cools and condenses into clouds.

09:06.300 --> 09:08.339
As the clouds drift inland,

09:08.340 --> 09:11.740
they bring rain to one of the least-
explored corners of our planet.

09:13.380 --> 09:14.860
The mountains of Mozambique.

09:31.500 --> 09:33.900
This the wettest place
in southern Africa.

09:40.220 --> 09:43.298
Decades of civil war have
kept travellers away

09:43.299 --> 09:44.980
from this little-known land.

09:46.100 --> 09:50.099
It was satellite mapping that
revealed the full extent

09:50.100 --> 09:52.619
of the forest that grows here,

09:52.620 --> 09:56.660
so now it's known to outsiders
as the Google rainforest.

10:03.180 --> 10:06.380
It could also be called
the butterfly forest.

10:12.340 --> 10:17.419
After the rains, butterflies have
emerged together in huge numbers.

10:17.420 --> 10:20.420
As soon as their wings dry out,
they will take to the air.

10:30.980 --> 10:33.020
Their goal? To find a mate.

10:35.300 --> 10:36.260
But how?

10:41.660 --> 10:45.818
There may be thousands close by,
but the foliage is so thick,

10:45.819 --> 10:47.860
it's difficult for them
to find each other.

10:54.260 --> 10:56.180
They have a remarkable solution.

10:57.820 --> 11:01.540
They follow rivers upstream
and travel to higher ground.

11:06.140 --> 11:08.980
The journey can take
hours of determined flying.

11:11.740 --> 11:15.860
Eventually they emerge into the only
open space there is.

11:21.780 --> 11:23.980
The treeless peak of Mount Mabu.

11:33.980 --> 11:37.060
Up here, free from the confines
of the forest,

11:37.061 --> 11:39.260
they hold a butterfly ball.

11:50.420 --> 11:53.178
Now the butterflies have
all the space they need

11:53.179 --> 11:54.900
for their aerobatic courtship.

12:09.500 --> 12:11.979
The male's strategy is simple.

12:11.980 --> 12:14.620
Fly higher and faster
than the competition,

12:14.621 --> 12:17.820
and just maybe you'll
win a virgin female.

12:31.380 --> 12:35.819
This spectacular gathering,
unseen by outsiders until now,

12:35.820 --> 12:39.579
happens for just half an hour
each morning

12:39.580 --> 12:41.380
and for just a few weeks
in the year.

12:51.700 --> 12:56.580
Once mated, the females descend back
to the rainforest to lay their eggs.

13:01.020 --> 13:04.620
A forest that only exists
because of moisture rising

13:04.621 --> 13:06.619
from the warm Agulhas current

13:06.620 --> 13:09.420
hundreds of miles away
in the Indian Ocean.

13:38.500 --> 13:44.339
The rainwater now flows southwards
from Mozambique's highest peaks

13:44.340 --> 13:46.780
to the lowlands of the Eastern Cape.

13:49.860 --> 13:53.539
And where the land flattens,
rivers slow,

13:53.540 --> 13:56.780
creating a vast swamp
50 miles across.

14:00.020 --> 14:01.620
This is Gorongosa.

14:05.700 --> 14:08.940
Here, all kinds of creatures
come to catch fish.

14:31.700 --> 14:34.379
Whiskered catfish work as a team.

14:34.380 --> 14:36.578
They take a gulp of air
at the surface

14:36.579 --> 14:40.420
and then belch it out underwater
to create a net of bubbles.

14:43.460 --> 14:45.300
And that traps little fish.

14:50.700 --> 14:52.260
There are fish for everyone.

15:07.420 --> 15:10.580
And each species has its own
technique for catching them.

15:17.620 --> 15:19.858
It's all very well
having a big beak,

15:19.859 --> 15:21.860
but you've still got
to know how to use it.

15:30.580 --> 15:32.620
This young pelican
has a lot to learn...

15:34.660 --> 15:35.900
..and not long to do so.

15:42.420 --> 15:46.140
Maybe, like the catfish,
teamwork is the answer.

15:59.580 --> 16:02.539
It's certainly working
for the flock,

16:02.540 --> 16:05.020
and this pelican seems to be
getting the hang of it.

16:14.020 --> 16:16.300
But surely it can't swallow
that catfish?

16:33.300 --> 16:35.180
Trying to was a mistake.

16:59.780 --> 17:03.459
The rainwater,
briefly held in Gorongosa's swamp,

17:03.460 --> 17:06.460
has now been enriched
with silt and sand.

17:11.819 --> 17:17.019
All down this coast, sediment-laden
rivers the Zambezi, the Limpopo,

17:17.020 --> 17:19.460
the Save drain back to the sea,

17:21.140 --> 17:23.859
and there they meet
the Agulhas current.

17:33.820 --> 17:35.900
And what happens to all that sand?

17:38.380 --> 17:41.300
Over the millennia,
the Agulhas has worked it

17:41.301 --> 17:43.860
into a complex underwater landscape.

17:58.100 --> 18:03.139
This vast sand sculpture is
the Bazaruto Archipelago,

18:03.140 --> 18:05.260
the oldest of its kind in the world.

18:18.620 --> 18:23.260
It may look like paradise,
but living here is not easy.

18:35.460 --> 18:39.339
For 100,000 years, the Agulhas
Current has battered

18:39.340 --> 18:43.220
these submerged dunes
with underwater sandstorms.

19:07.340 --> 19:11.619
But where the water is deep enough
to escape these storms,

19:11.620 --> 19:16.900
nutrients carried from Africa's
interior fuel an explosion of life.

19:32.300 --> 19:34.740
A rare oceanic hunter rules here.

19:38.860 --> 19:40.180
Giant Kingfish.

19:42.300 --> 19:44.658
As big as a man,
and weight for weight,

19:44.659 --> 19:46.740
one of the most powerful fish
in the sea.

19:51.300 --> 19:55.300
Despite their size, they're
extraordinarily agile when hunting.

20:14.540 --> 20:16.859
Normally kingfish are solitary,

20:16.860 --> 20:20.260
but for just a few weeks each year,
they gather at places

20:20.261 --> 20:24.220
like Bazaruto and prepare
for an extraordinary journey.

20:30.900 --> 20:33.460
One that will take them far inland.

20:39.620 --> 20:40.980
The Mtentu River.

20:54.020 --> 20:57.620
A king of kingfish
leads them upstream.

21:01.940 --> 21:04.140
As they travel
further into fresh water,

21:04.141 --> 21:09.420
they seem to change from aggressive
hunters into dedicated pilgrims.

21:22.980 --> 21:25.340
Now,
many miles from their natural home,

21:25.341 --> 21:30.940
and in response to an unknown cue,
they stop and begin to circle.

21:40.500 --> 21:44.378
Other marine fish that migrate
upriver usually do so in order

21:44.379 --> 21:48.460
to breed, but there's no evidence
that these kingfish spawn up here.

21:52.740 --> 21:56.540
Neither do they hunt.
So what are they doing?

22:07.340 --> 22:11.020
In truth, the purpose of this
strange behaviour is still unknown.

22:16.500 --> 22:18.099
Within a few weeks,

22:18.100 --> 22:21.460
they will retrace their journey back
to the ocean.

22:30.900 --> 22:35.018
The lives of kingfish, like those
of turtles and butterflies

22:35.019 --> 22:38.620
and pelicans, are influenced
by the Agulhas Current.

22:46.900 --> 22:49.780
But that influence can only reach
so far.

22:52.780 --> 22:54.660
And this is why.

22:57.460 --> 22:59.100
The Drakensberg mountains.

23:10.740 --> 23:13.620
Here, local people say that the
vultures soar so high,

23:13.621 --> 23:16.540
they can see into the future.

23:38.940 --> 23:43.179
These sheer cliffs,
rising to over 3,000 metres,

23:43.180 --> 23:45.500
hold back the advancing rain clouds

23:45.501 --> 23:49.660
and, as a result, the land beyond
them is starved of water.

24:01.580 --> 24:04.900
This is the greatest
expanse of sand in the world.

24:06.100 --> 24:07.979
A seemingly-endless desert

24:07.980 --> 24:11.580
that is the vast parched
centre of Southern Africa.

24:22.780 --> 24:25.659
Thousands of miles to the west,

24:25.660 --> 24:30.900
where this desert meets the Atlantic
Ocean, another current prevails.

24:35.420 --> 24:39.578
But the Benguela Current,
surging up the west side of Africa,

24:39.579 --> 24:41.460
has a very different character.

24:49.940 --> 24:53.499
It's extremely cold,
full of nutrients

24:53.500 --> 24:55.300
and it's thronged with life.

25:03.420 --> 25:04.380
A great white shark.

25:06.140 --> 25:08.540
They can raise their body
temperature to 10 degrees

25:08.541 --> 25:10.940
above that
of the surrounding sea.

25:16.020 --> 25:19.500
But doing so requires an enormous
amount of high-grade fuel.

25:24.220 --> 25:30.020
So this is a great bonanza
for them the body of a dead whale.

25:37.900 --> 25:42.420
The carcass will draw in every great
white for miles around.

25:45.100 --> 25:49.100
And here, off Cape Town,
that means a lot of sharks.

26:00.900 --> 26:02.978
Instead of feeding in a frenzy,

26:02.979 --> 26:05.820
these sharks have rather refined
table manners.

26:16.380 --> 26:20.380
They swim side-by-side to get
the measure of each other.

26:22.820 --> 26:25.060
Then each takes its turn.

26:32.820 --> 26:36.020
This female is the biggest,
so she eats first.

27:01.660 --> 27:04.420
The next only feeds
when she gives way.

27:39.860 --> 27:42.458
The waters of the Benguela
are so rich,

27:42.459 --> 27:47.220
they support more great white sharks
than any other seas on the planet.

27:58.300 --> 28:00.139
And they are so cold,

28:00.140 --> 28:04.540
they attract some surprising
creatures to these African shores.

28:10.060 --> 28:11.740
Penguins.

28:13.380 --> 28:14.940
African penguins.

28:22.540 --> 28:25.980
This female is returning
to relieve her partner.

28:29.300 --> 28:31.419
Of course there's no ice here,

28:31.420 --> 28:33.820
but these rocks can be
almost as slippery.

29:08.780 --> 29:10.818
But there are more serious obstacles

29:10.819 --> 29:12.900
than the slippery rocks
awaiting them.

29:24.460 --> 29:28.900
It's his turn to feed, so he leaves
her to look after their eggs.

29:40.020 --> 29:44.258
Now she must tackle a problem
faced by no other kind of penguin.

29:44.259 --> 29:47.020
For the next 10 days,
she must protect her eggs

29:47.021 --> 29:49.100
from the African sun.

30:02.740 --> 30:04.218
A dense coat of feathers

30:04.219 --> 30:07.140
that keeps her warm in cold seas
now stifles her.

30:11.140 --> 30:13.259
On these exposed rocks,

30:13.260 --> 30:16.260
she must shade her eggs
instead of keeping them warm.

30:21.820 --> 30:24.180
Everything here seems
the wrong way round.

30:38.500 --> 30:43.020
For some, the soaring
temperature is too much.

30:50.860 --> 30:53.060
A neighbour deserts his nest.

30:56.220 --> 30:58.460
His egg will not survive.

31:10.220 --> 31:12.180
He's not the only one to give up.

31:14.020 --> 31:17.180
Some years,
not a single chick is reared.

31:28.140 --> 31:29.979
Penguins are adapted

31:29.980 --> 31:34.099
to withstand temperatures
of 40 degrees below zero,

31:34.100 --> 31:35.820
not 40 degrees above.

31:51.940 --> 31:55.818
Now, at the hottest part of the day,
the very worst time,

31:55.819 --> 31:57.260
her chicks are hatching.

32:06.540 --> 32:12.620
Just when they need her most, she's
reaching the limit of her endurance.

32:26.700 --> 32:29.299
After 10 days of intensive fishing,

32:29.300 --> 32:33.740
the chicks' father comes back
to take his turn at the nest.

32:35.140 --> 32:36.580
But will he be too late?

32:56.100 --> 32:58.500
He greets his young for the very
first time.

33:09.900 --> 33:14.779
The coolness of the Benguela Current
brought the penguins here

33:14.780 --> 33:18.899
but that very coolness
is a great disadvantage,

33:18.900 --> 33:20.980
because it generates little rain.

33:28.220 --> 33:31.700
It can, however, produce
moisture in a different form.

33:38.780 --> 33:41.939
A thick blanket of fog
rolls in from the sea

33:41.940 --> 33:45.620
and condenses on this thirsty land.

33:53.180 --> 33:58.420
And each year, the desert bursts
into life with a dazzling display.

34:07.420 --> 34:11.859
Water is so scarce that this
show will not last long,

34:11.860 --> 34:15.300
so plants compete to attract
their pollinators with colour.

34:28.340 --> 34:32.978
Here in Namaqualand,
a 600-mile strip of coastal desert

34:32.980 --> 34:35.219
becomes carpeted with blooms.

34:50.699 --> 34:54.059
The morning sun opens
a Namaqua daisy,

34:54.060 --> 34:58.780
and reveals a male monkey beetle
asleep inside.

35:06.260 --> 35:09.938
Nights here are so cold that monkey
beetles shelter within

35:09.939 --> 35:11.980
the closed-up petals of the daisies.

35:18.220 --> 35:21.139
The habit brings benefits
to both sides.

35:21.140 --> 35:24.540
The beetle is kept warm
and the flower gets pollinated.

35:26.140 --> 35:30.580
But now the beetle has urgent
business. He must find a mate.

35:38.620 --> 35:43.660
As he searches, he hops from bloom
to bloom, pollinating each in turn.

35:48.900 --> 35:51.380
At last he spots a potential mate.

35:53.940 --> 35:55.220
A golden princess.

36:03.780 --> 36:05.020
But here comes trouble.

36:08.020 --> 36:09.300
A rival.

36:19.860 --> 36:21.940
There's no time for introductions.

36:28.540 --> 36:29.940
But he's been too slow.

36:37.700 --> 36:40.140
The rivals immediately
begin to brawl.

36:46.460 --> 36:48.778
The female will only mate inside the
daisy,

36:48.779 --> 36:50.460
so they wrestle for possession.

37:09.820 --> 37:13.140
They're so engrossed in fighting,
they've pushed her off.

37:28.460 --> 37:30.700
The challenger is ejected.

37:46.340 --> 37:49.580
The winner wastes no time
before getting back to business.

38:08.300 --> 38:09.700
At last!

38:24.980 --> 38:28.619
Now there will be a new
generation of monkey beetles

38:28.620 --> 38:31.260
to pollinate these
Namaqualand flowers.

38:39.580 --> 38:42.940
For most of the year this land
is desperately dry,

38:42.941 --> 38:44.979
but just occasionally,

38:44.980 --> 38:47.660
brief, violent storms
sweep in from the cold ocean.

39:02.140 --> 39:05.178
Springbok have been roaming
this desert for many months,

39:05.179 --> 39:09.300
searching for one of these rare
and highly localised downpours.

39:34.260 --> 39:35.860
The grass is sprouting.

39:40.700 --> 39:42.540
And that is worth celebrating!

39:55.380 --> 39:59.660
If you're a springbok,
that means pronking.

41:24.740 --> 41:27.300
We still don't know exactly why
they do this.

41:29.620 --> 41:33.060
The simplest answer is that
they're dancing for joy.

41:55.020 --> 41:57.260
Africa's most southerly tip.

42:00.140 --> 42:03.938
This is where the two great ocean
currents, the warm Agulhas

42:03.939 --> 42:06.740
and the cold Benguela,
crash into one another.

42:11.860 --> 42:16.300
And this collision, in itself,
draws in life in abundance.

42:30.980 --> 42:34.980
A super-pod of hunting dolphins,
5,000 strong.

42:49.900 --> 42:51.220
And shadowing them...

42:55.300 --> 42:57.140
..Africa's biggest predator.

43:00.340 --> 43:01.620
A Bryde's whale.

43:04.180 --> 43:07.099
This female is 15 metres long

43:07.100 --> 43:10.340
and weighs more than a whole
family of elephants.

43:22.180 --> 43:25.819
The dolphins are in pursuit
of sardines

43:25.820 --> 43:27.420
millions of them.

43:30.860 --> 43:34.698
But these cold-water fish
are heading towards an impenetrable

43:34.699 --> 43:39.140
barrier of warm water that they will
not cross, the Agulhas Current.

43:43.660 --> 43:44.820
They're trapped.

43:50.740 --> 43:52.980
And that gives the whale her chance.

44:13.780 --> 44:15.778
But the sardines are so speedy

44:15.779 --> 44:18.820
that the whale only catches a few
with each pass.

44:27.220 --> 44:29.340
More and more hunters arrive.

44:38.900 --> 44:42.738
The whale needs the other hunters
to push the fish upwards,

44:42.739 --> 44:44.580
forcing them against the surface.

44:56.300 --> 44:58.020
Now they have nowhere to escape.

45:15.700 --> 45:18.500
With each lumbering turn
she loses precious time,

45:18.501 --> 45:20.940
time that favours the more nimble.

45:40.260 --> 45:42.178
The Bryde's whale probably knows

45:42.179 --> 45:45.340
that this opportunity will last less
than five minutes.

45:47.340 --> 45:51.340
And with the last
few lunges, she finally cashes in.

46:44.300 --> 46:46.698
The forces that triggered
this great event

46:46.699 --> 46:49.180
have also shaped the fortunes
of life

46:49.181 --> 46:52.020
far beyond this particular
battleground.

46:55.460 --> 46:58.980
Without these currents,
Southern Africa would be a desert.

47:04.180 --> 47:08.299
But combined, the very different
powers of the Agulhas

47:08.300 --> 47:10.858
and the Benguela have transformed
the Cape

47:10.859 --> 47:12.940
into a land where life can flourish.

47:38.820 --> 47:41.899
The Comoro Islands
off Africa's east coast

47:41.900 --> 47:44.220
are a haven for green turtles.

47:49.180 --> 47:52.700
Every year, a million turtles
hatch on these beaches,

47:52.701 --> 47:57.140
but the chances of any one of them
surviving is tiny.

48:06.180 --> 48:10.179
The Africa team came here to try
and capture the dramatic

48:10.180 --> 48:12.980
first few minutes in the lives
of these baby turtles.

48:15.060 --> 48:18.860
It was to be both a technical, and
surprisingly emotional challenge.

48:29.780 --> 48:32.698
It's only when you get down on the
eye level of the baby turtle

48:32.699 --> 48:35.538
that you realise what an enormous
journey it's got to make

48:35.539 --> 48:37.740
down over the beach, and it really
is quite epic.

48:40.220 --> 48:43.459
That's fine.
Oh, yeah, that's lovely.

48:43.460 --> 48:46.298
It's using all these complicated,
heavy bits of equipment

48:46.299 --> 48:47.978
which hopefully will enable us

48:47.979 --> 48:51.180
to get into the world of a turtle
which is just a few inches long.

49:01.780 --> 49:04.418
As they break out of all the soft
sand, they hit the hard sand

49:04.419 --> 49:06.420
and that's where the real
sprint takes place.

49:08.060 --> 49:09.898
They must be desperate to hit that
water,

49:09.899 --> 49:12.098
because you can see the sea's
just over the horizon.

49:12.099 --> 49:13.698
We're following them
all the way down

49:13.699 --> 49:16.180
and you do kind of get involved
with them and cheering them on.

49:20.300 --> 49:21.980
OK, slow down a bit. Slow down.

49:25.740 --> 49:28.178
And suddenly all these crows
come flocking in

49:28.179 --> 49:32.220
and start picking them off and you
just think, that's just so unfair.

49:33.660 --> 49:35.740
Lots more coming in.
Just loads coming in now.

49:40.140 --> 49:41.498
I do, God, I feel for them.

49:41.499 --> 49:43.178
You know it's really quite upsetting

49:43.179 --> 49:45.618
and particularly when you're
looking through the camera

49:45.619 --> 49:48.258
and I'm just filling frame with
a turtle running down the beach,

49:48.259 --> 49:51.500
then suddenly from nowhere, a beak
comes in and whoosh, that's it.

49:53.940 --> 49:55.140
That turtle's no more.

50:01.100 --> 50:04.699
The turtles that escape the perils
of the beach

50:04.700 --> 50:07.260
still have to face pounding surf.

50:14.020 --> 50:16.060
But, at last, they're
in their element.

50:22.180 --> 50:24.859
More than can be said for the crew.

50:24.860 --> 50:27.178
They're faster than you,
aren't they? Yep.

50:27.179 --> 50:28.500
It's a bit embarrassing.

50:29.940 --> 50:32.100
Beaten by something
that's less than a day old.

50:35.220 --> 50:37.218
When you see hatchlings
get off the beach

50:37.219 --> 50:40.740
and going in the white water, you'd
think they'd just get obliterated.

50:44.340 --> 50:47.578
They just punch through the water
they do get flung around

50:47.579 --> 50:50.418
but then they just right themselves,
keep on swimming and they're

50:50.419 --> 50:53.820
ahead of you, coming out the back
of the wave and it's amazing.

50:56.420 --> 50:59.178
You're seeing all these baby turtles
getting picked off,

50:59.179 --> 51:01.578
left, right and centre,
but they just keep going.

51:01.579 --> 51:03.260
They are just so resilient.

51:10.340 --> 51:13.340
And that made what happened next
so distressing.

51:17.180 --> 51:19.820
A particularly high spring tide
flooded the beach.

51:21.780 --> 51:25.540
Any baby turtles still in their
nests would be lucky to survive.

51:27.100 --> 51:28.980
See it bubbling out as well.
Yeah. See the air.

51:31.860 --> 51:33.858
Well, it means that basically
anything below

51:33.859 --> 51:35.298
that line's going to be gone.

51:35.299 --> 51:36.739
Let's hope and pray it's not, but...

51:38.980 --> 51:40.980
As you say, we don't know,
let's wait and see.

51:50.340 --> 51:53.180
All across the world,
turtles are in decline.

51:54.380 --> 51:56.059
Their eggs are stolen,

51:56.060 --> 51:59.059
the adults are hunted
for their flesh

51:59.060 --> 52:00.860
and they drown in fishing nets.

52:02.940 --> 52:05.740
But here in the Comoros,
they have friends.

52:07.940 --> 52:09.618
It's amazing here in Itsamia.

52:09.619 --> 52:12.458
It's just a really heartening
story of how the local people

52:12.459 --> 52:15.298
are doing everything
they can to protect sort of

52:15.299 --> 52:17.580
what they think of as their turtles.

52:19.140 --> 52:22.820
And some of the baby turtles
have survived the flood tide.

52:50.700 --> 52:53.340
The whole village
comes to help the hatchlings.

52:55.540 --> 52:57.778
But the most important effort is to
protect

52:57.779 --> 53:01.220
the adults from outsiders who would
hunt them for their meat.

53:05.500 --> 53:08.378
They've taken it upon themselves
to really police the beaches

53:08.379 --> 53:10.940
around here and make sure that
poaching is kept to a minimum.

53:15.100 --> 53:18.618
The selfless protection these people
provide means that this is

53:18.619 --> 53:21.340
one of the few places in the world
where turtle numbers

53:21.341 --> 53:23.340
are actually increasing.

53:26.860 --> 53:30.860
And remarkably, here in Itsamia,
the population has in fact

53:30.861 --> 53:32.900
doubled in the last decade.

53:39.700 --> 53:41.780
As the shoot was coming to the end,

53:41.781 --> 53:45.739
cameraman Kevin Flay noticed
that some of the turtles

53:45.740 --> 53:48.940
that made it through the surf
faced one last danger.

53:50.060 --> 53:52.458
I'm getting shots of a kite
which is flying down

53:52.459 --> 53:54.898
and taking turtles off the water
surface.

53:54.899 --> 53:57.140
That was a part of the story
we had to tell.

53:59.500 --> 54:03.459
The aim is for us to be underwater,

54:03.460 --> 54:05.820
looking straight up as this happens,

54:05.821 --> 54:11.260
and that's actually
really quite hard.

54:12.460 --> 54:15.380
OK. Three, two, one...

54:17.620 --> 54:19.860
Undeterred,
the crew got into position.

54:26.620 --> 54:27.980
There we go, the kite's up.

54:42.820 --> 54:45.418
You can't see where you're going
because my head's glued

54:45.419 --> 54:48.658
to this viewfinder, so I'm banging
into rocks and things like that.

54:48.659 --> 54:51.260
I'm really just trying to keep
the turtle in shot.

55:08.580 --> 55:10.018
Something came in then.

55:10.019 --> 55:13.498
She came in and swooped down
over the water's surface.

55:13.499 --> 55:14.978
And you could see
the kite from underwater?

55:14.979 --> 55:16.658
I could see it,
I could see the shape.

55:16.659 --> 55:18.100
In frame and you were running?
Yep.

55:22.020 --> 55:24.138
Didn't take the turtle.
Didn't take the turtle.

55:24.139 --> 55:26.618
Probably that's the best of both
worlds, because we got

55:26.619 --> 55:29.300
our lovely underwater shot of a kite
and the turtle gets away!

55:32.380 --> 55:34.620
This lucky hatchling
isn't the only one.

55:36.140 --> 55:39.698
With the help of the village
of Itsamia, thousands more

55:39.699 --> 55:41.940
have a chance to make it
to the open ocean.

55:43.580 --> 55:46.338
It's only really local populations
that can actually support

55:46.339 --> 55:48.138
and sustain this conservation work.

55:48.139 --> 55:52.218
If it comes from the roots upwards,
then it's got a chance of success.

55:52.219 --> 55:54.938
You know, I think it's amazing,
I really do, the fact that they

55:54.939 --> 55:57.620
do this and you know we should see
it more often around the world.

56:01.340 --> 56:04.060
It's hard not to admire these
extraordinary little creatures

56:04.061 --> 56:06.660
as they battle against such odds.

56:13.220 --> 56:16.059
This baby turtle
won't touch land again

56:16.060 --> 56:20.060
until she returns to the very same
island to lay her own eggs.

56:21.700 --> 56:24.700
With luck, she'll find the beach
is still protected

56:24.701 --> 56:27.980
by the people of Itsamia.
