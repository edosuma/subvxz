00:12.714 --> 00:14.614
Oh, yeah, baby.

00:15.751 --> 00:17.480
I love you, too.

00:21.824 --> 00:23.951
Oh, man, not again.

00:24.026 --> 00:25.789
Meet your new girlfriend.

00:25.861 --> 00:28.193
Hey, Oken, is she your main squeeze?

00:28.263 --> 00:32.825
Did you get it, squeeze? Orange?
How do I come up with this stuff?

00:38.607 --> 00:40.006
Hey, leave him alone.

00:40.075 --> 00:43.442
- Yeah, nobody picks on Oliver but us.
- That's right.

00:43.512 --> 00:44.570
Hey!

00:44.646 --> 00:46.307
I mean,
if we were going to pick on Oliver,

00:46.381 --> 00:48.076
we easily could've said,

00:48.150 --> 00:52.678
- "Oh, man, you make an ugly girl. "
- But we didn't. Even though it's true.

00:53.021 --> 00:55.012
Thanks. Hey!

00:55.724 --> 00:58.750
Okay, people, it's pop quiz time!

01:00.729 --> 01:02.162
First question.

01:02.231 --> 01:06.065
Who can tell me why this is
the worst day of my life?

01:07.736 --> 01:09.795
Let it go, man. Let it go.

01:11.974 --> 01:15.341
You got passed over for
principal again, Mr. Picker.

01:18.146 --> 01:21.274
That's right, Oken,
poke the bear with a stick.

01:22.184 --> 01:24.618
By the way, that's not your color.

01:26.622 --> 01:31.559
No, my rapture today is because
I lost a bet with Coach Hendricks,

01:31.627 --> 01:34.687
and I am now the chaperone
of this year's class camping trip.

01:34.763 --> 01:36.822
Oh, man.
- Oh, no, don't moan.

01:36.899 --> 01:40.858
It'll be great, sitting by the campfire,
telling stories,

01:40.936 --> 01:44.463
being eaten alive
by disease-ridden bugs, oh joy.

01:45.140 --> 01:48.303
Come on guys, camping's fun.
I do it all the time.

01:48.377 --> 01:52.108
Little Miss Miley Sunshine,
trying to turn my frown upside down.

01:52.180 --> 01:56.241
That's very sweet and at this moment,
terribly annoying.

01:56.318 --> 01:57.785
Have your parents fill out these forms

01:57.853 --> 02:01.687
so you can spend 24 glorious hours
with me and no indoor plumbing.

02:04.159 --> 02:06.593
I don't want to go
to the bathroom in the woods.

02:06.662 --> 02:10.996
- I don't even like going here.
- Come on, guys, think about it.

02:11.066 --> 02:14.126
Sitting under the stars,
breathing all that fresh mountain air,

02:14.202 --> 02:16.830
surrounded by the sounds of nature.

02:20.509 --> 02:23.239
- What are you doing?
- A chipmunk, duh.

02:23.679 --> 02:26.580
Could you be any more of a hillbilly?

02:26.648 --> 02:31.017
You know, I could've done a pig,
but you guys already got that covered.

02:31.353 --> 02:32.377
Mmm.

02:32.454 --> 02:34.149
What's that I smell?

02:34.222 --> 02:36.383
Bacon that just got burned!

02:37.092 --> 02:38.286
- Geeks.
- Freaks.

02:38.360 --> 02:40.260
- Loser. Loser.
- Loser. Loser.

02:40.329 --> 02:41.455
Oooh.

02:44.266 --> 02:46.757
You do that stupid finger thing
one more time and your...

02:46.835 --> 02:49.065
Oh, cat fight on aisle five.

02:49.137 --> 02:50.729
Sir, we were just talking about
what a kick it's gonna be

02:50.806 --> 02:52.171
getting to know each other better.
Right, guys?

02:52.240 --> 02:53.264
- Right.
Oh, yeah!

02:53.342 --> 02:54.366
Right.
- You bet!

02:54.443 --> 02:56.570
Good, you're sharing
the same tent together.

02:56.645 --> 02:57.907
- What?
- What?

03:07.089 --> 03:08.488
<i> Come on!</i>

03:08.557 --> 03:12.584
<i>You get the limo out front</i>

03:12.661 --> 03:16.256
<i>Hottest styles, every shoe, every color</i>

03:16.331 --> 03:20.131
<i>Yeah, when you're famous</i>
<i>it can be kind of fun</i>

03:20.202 --> 03:24.070
<i>It's really you</i>
<i>but no one ever discovers</i>

03:25.107 --> 03:28.338
<i>Who would have thought</i>
<i>that a girl like me</i>

03:28.410 --> 03:33.746
<i>Would double as a superstar?</i>

03:33.815 --> 03:37.842
<i>You get the best of both worlds</i>

03:37.919 --> 03:39.716
<i>Chill it out, take it slow</i>

03:39.788 --> 03:41.449
<i>Then you rock out the show</i>

03:41.523 --> 03:46.017
<i>You get the best of both worlds</i>

03:46.094 --> 03:47.391
<i>Mix it all together</i>

03:47.462 --> 03:50.693
<i>And you know that</i>
<i>it's the best of both worlds</i>

03:58.073 --> 04:00.769
Ninety-eight... I see ya.

04:01.510 --> 04:04.206
Ninety-nine... I'm coming to get ya.

04:04.846 --> 04:06.074
One hundred.

04:06.148 --> 04:10.278
Okay, darling, it's time for me
and you to do a little dance.

04:22.931 --> 04:24.922
Honey, you look terrible.

04:25.133 --> 04:26.691
Couldn't sleep.

04:27.269 --> 04:28.998
Feel sick.

04:31.273 --> 04:33.138
You know, you sound
kind of like that old mule

04:33.208 --> 04:36.803
that used to haul fat
Uncle Earl up that hill to church.

04:37.679 --> 04:40.739
And look at that rash. That's it.

04:40.816 --> 04:42.511
You're not going
on that camping trip today.

04:42.584 --> 04:45.815
But, Daddy, I'm fine.

04:50.826 --> 04:53.056
Sorry, darling,
but you're going back to bed.

04:53.128 --> 04:55.756
And I guess I'll just have to call
and cancel that interview

04:55.831 --> 04:58.231
I had set up for Hannah Montana
and Taylor Kingsford.

04:58.300 --> 05:01.531
Taylor Kingsford?
He is the coolest V J on TV!

05:01.603 --> 05:03.366
This is awesome!

05:05.140 --> 05:06.129
I mean...

05:08.310 --> 05:12.713
Nice try. But next time you might
wanna go for a waterproof rash.

05:13.882 --> 05:15.281
I'm healed!

05:15.784 --> 05:17.149
Hallelujah?

05:18.053 --> 05:22.615
Miley, I know you just don't wanna
share a tent with Amber and Ashley,

05:22.691 --> 05:26.058
but sometimes you just gotta make
the best out of a bad situation.

05:26.128 --> 05:29.461
Well, in that case,
I'm gonna need a jar of honey,

05:29.531 --> 05:32.898
1,000 red ants
and the cover of nightfall.

05:34.836 --> 05:35.996
You know, at times like this,

05:36.071 --> 05:39.507
I'm gonna say to you
what I used to say to your mother.

05:39.574 --> 05:41.701
Keep your mitts off my cake.

05:43.678 --> 05:46.704
Mile, I know those girls
don't always treat you right,

05:46.781 --> 05:49.545
but sinking down to their level
just isn't the answer.

05:49.618 --> 05:52.678
Dad, how do we really know that
until we try?

05:53.588 --> 05:56.421
Well, you remember that kid
that always used to tease Jackson?

05:56.491 --> 06:00.894
Then Jackson snuck into his bathroom,
put glue all over his toilet seat?

06:06.368 --> 06:09.337
It would've worked if I hadn't slipped.

06:13.074 --> 06:15.872
He sure gave that crowd in
the emergency room a good laugh.

06:15.944 --> 06:18.572
Good times, good times.

06:18.847 --> 06:21.816
But my point is,
if you're gonna lie down with dogs,

06:21.883 --> 06:23.043
you're gonna get up with fleas.

06:23.118 --> 06:25.279
Not if I wear a flea collar!

06:25.687 --> 06:29.646
Mile, as a favor to me,
be the better person.

06:29.724 --> 06:31.191
But, Dad,
I already am the better person,

06:31.259 --> 06:33.523
so why do I have to act like it?

06:33.595 --> 06:35.062
Promise me.

06:35.664 --> 06:38.292
- Okay, fine.
- That's my girl.

06:39.501 --> 06:40.798
Oh, man.

06:41.636 --> 06:44.104
That dang mouse
is chewing on the wires again!

06:44.172 --> 06:46.504
That's it,
I guess this time I'm just gonna...

06:46.575 --> 06:50.011
Oh, no, you're not.
That mouse is a living creature.

06:50.078 --> 06:52.774
I even gave it a name. Linda.

06:54.182 --> 06:56.241
It's Spanish for pretty.

06:56.685 --> 07:00.485
Well, you better start learning
the Spanish word for squished.

07:06.494 --> 07:09.019
It was the sixth day without food.

07:09.097 --> 07:12.464
Only one man could guide
the remaining survivors to safety.

07:12.534 --> 07:16.971
Oliver Oscar Oken. "The Triple-O,"
known the world over as...

07:17.706 --> 07:18.866
"Ooo. "

07:20.508 --> 07:22.806
That is so not funny anymore.

07:24.279 --> 07:28.773
It's the Malibu Miley Cat!
Very rare, very vicious!

07:30.151 --> 07:32.142
Okay, people.

07:32.220 --> 07:35.348
One, two, three, drop!

07:35.991 --> 07:39.483
Excellent, now if only we could
pick them up and leave.

07:39.561 --> 07:42.121
Could there possibly be
a better place to study nature?

07:42.197 --> 07:43.596
The answer is yes.

07:43.665 --> 07:47.294
On a 42-inch Hi Def plasma TV
in the comfort of my den,

07:48.570 --> 07:51.095
just steps away from indoor plumbing.

07:51.172 --> 07:53.470
Come on, Mr. Picker,
you can't experience

07:53.541 --> 07:56.203
the feel and smell of nature on your TV.

07:56.278 --> 07:58.371
That's the whole point.

07:58.446 --> 08:03.110
Now set up your tents, get into them
and pray for the next 24 hours.

08:03.184 --> 08:05.675
Because that's what I'll be doing.

08:08.056 --> 08:09.717
There they are.

08:10.959 --> 08:13.951
- I've got a clear shot.
- Lilly, no, we might get in trouble.

08:14.029 --> 08:15.519
Let me handle this.

08:15.597 --> 08:18.862
Okay, but make it hurt.

08:18.933 --> 08:21.401
Trust me. You can count on that.

08:22.904 --> 08:25.236
Okay, I know
we've had our problems,

08:25.307 --> 08:28.538
but Lilly and I are willing to forget
if you are.

08:30.211 --> 08:31.644
I thought you said you were
gonna make it hurt!

08:31.713 --> 08:34.841
That was the most painful thing
I've ever done.

08:37.385 --> 08:39.511
But I promised my dad
I'd be the better person.

08:39.587 --> 08:40.712
Well, I didn't!

08:40.789 --> 08:43.188
Lilly, please, I can't do this without you.

08:43.258 --> 08:46.091
- Help me because you're my friend.
- No.

08:46.161 --> 08:47.856
Because you know
it's the right thing to do.

08:47.929 --> 08:49.988
Oh... No.

08:51.299 --> 08:54.564
Because I'm on Taylor Kingsford,
your favorite show, tomorrow night

08:54.636 --> 08:57.605
and if you don't help me,
I'm not taking you.

08:59.240 --> 09:01.834
Hello, tent pals!

09:02.344 --> 09:04.869
Who wants me to braid their hair?

09:07.716 --> 09:10.742
What do you say we put up this tent,
and make a fire

09:10.819 --> 09:13.617
and cook ourselves up
a big pot of friendship?

09:13.688 --> 09:17.055
Well,
we'd like to, but we don't speak hillbilly.

09:17.125 --> 09:19.923
Or do
our wash down yonder in the crick.

09:23.031 --> 09:25.192
You're funny.
- I hate them.

09:25.266 --> 09:28.724
Just remember Taylor Kingsford,
your favorite show.

09:28.803 --> 09:30.168
You know what I'm thinking, Ash?

09:30.238 --> 09:31.705
- Half-caff...
- Non-fat,

09:31.773 --> 09:32.967
- grande latte with just...
- Grande latte with just

09:33.041 --> 09:37.034
- a sprinkle winkle of cinnamon.
... a sprinkle winkle of cinnamon.

09:39.447 --> 09:42.439
That's it,
I'm going to sprinkle their winkles.

09:42.517 --> 09:43.575
Lilly. No!

09:45.820 --> 09:47.378
That's a bite.

09:48.056 --> 09:50.047
That's a big bite.

09:54.896 --> 09:56.523
Well, this is just great.

09:56.598 --> 09:57.895
Amber and Ashley bail,

09:57.966 --> 10:00.059
and now we have to put up this thing
all by ourselves.

10:00.135 --> 10:03.935
I mean, ask me to change the trucks
on a skateboard, I can do that.

10:04.005 --> 10:06.565
But a tent? This'll take forever!

10:08.343 --> 10:09.674
Ta-da!

10:10.345 --> 10:12.677
- How did you do that?
- When you're raised in Tennessee,

10:12.747 --> 10:14.977
they teach you this stuff
before you're potty trained.

10:15.049 --> 10:17.677
Go look inside, there's cut flowers.

10:25.326 --> 10:26.554
Linda.

10:27.328 --> 10:28.920
Come on, Linda.

10:30.398 --> 10:32.559
- Dad?
- Shh!

10:33.601 --> 10:35.159
- Dad?
- Shh!

10:36.871 --> 10:38.498
- But, Dad.
- What?

10:43.978 --> 10:45.843
I was just gonna tell you
if you stop looking at the plate

10:45.914 --> 10:47.779
maybe the mouse will come.

10:47.849 --> 10:49.373
I was right!

11:02.430 --> 11:05.263
Donny, I don't think it goes that way.

11:05.333 --> 11:07.665
You should've stopped after
"I don't think. "

11:07.735 --> 11:10.704
Did you hear that, guys? "I don't think!"

11:10.772 --> 11:12.899
Because he doesn't think!

11:13.675 --> 11:15.336
I own you!

11:16.377 --> 11:19.869
Yeah, well, you should've stopped after
"Did you hear that?"

11:19.948 --> 11:22.815
Did you hear that?
Right?

11:27.222 --> 11:28.382
Give it to me!

11:28.456 --> 11:32.119
- You can pull harder than that, wimp!
- Oh, wimpier!

11:36.264 --> 11:39.028
Step aside, rookies,
let me show you how to do this.

11:39.100 --> 11:41.591
- I can do it if he'd just let go!
- You let go!

11:41.669 --> 11:44.433
Tent wedgie, tent wedgie!

11:46.941 --> 11:49.705
No place to buy a latte,
no place to buy shoes,

11:49.777 --> 11:51.711
and not a single multi-plex.

11:51.779 --> 11:54.907
Why would anyone want to come
to the woods?

11:55.583 --> 11:59.383
There's nothing but trees.
What a waste of space.

12:00.722 --> 12:03.316
And we're supposed to sleep in this?

12:04.859 --> 12:06.087
It's synthetic!

12:08.062 --> 12:10.326
Let go!
You let go.

12:10.765 --> 12:12.995
- What are you doing?
- Pitching a tent.

12:13.067 --> 12:15.092
- How's it working out for ya?
- I'm hanging in.

12:15.169 --> 12:19.071
Great. I have so many bites
on my tush, it looks like a waffle.

12:19.440 --> 12:20.532
Mr. Picker?

12:20.608 --> 12:23.441
- Did we build ours the right way?
- What?

12:25.046 --> 12:27.173
Wow, I'm impressed.

12:27.916 --> 12:31.147
But Miley put up that tent!
They just went for lattes!

12:31.219 --> 12:33.312
- Lattes?
- In the forest?

12:37.158 --> 12:40.355
I can't believe you would try
to take credit for something we did.

12:40.428 --> 12:42.555
All we wanted to do was put up a tent,

12:42.630 --> 12:46.566
make a fire and cook us up
a big pot of friendship.

12:46.634 --> 12:48.465
That's what I said!

12:48.536 --> 12:51.767
She's taking credit again!
Mr. Picker, make her stop.

12:51.839 --> 12:54.637
- Please make her stop.
- If it'll make you stop, sure.

12:54.709 --> 12:55.971
Listen, here's a thought,

12:56.044 --> 12:57.477
why don't we just apologize
to each other?

12:57.545 --> 13:01.879
Or at the very least, somebody fake
an illness so we can all go home.

13:01.950 --> 13:03.144
Fine.

13:03.918 --> 13:05.180
I'm sorry.

13:08.856 --> 13:11.222
Right. We're both sorry...

13:11.859 --> 13:14.453
That you are two lying, evil nasties!

13:14.529 --> 13:16.963
Oh, how I wanna go home!

13:22.203 --> 13:25.468
Just a tip.
In the future when apologizing,

13:25.540 --> 13:28.338
avoid the phrase
"lying, evil nasties. "

13:31.012 --> 13:33.276
- Here.
- What's your problem?

13:33.348 --> 13:35.407
I have to share a tent
with Donny tonight.

13:35.483 --> 13:36.507
So?

13:36.584 --> 13:39.451
He's had five helpings of beans.

13:39.520 --> 13:42.045
Come on, Oliver,
it's not like he did it on purpose.

13:42.123 --> 13:43.590
Hey, Oken.

13:47.762 --> 13:49.286
I think he did.

13:52.700 --> 13:55.168
Look, we feel bad about this.

13:55.236 --> 13:58.205
We didn't think
he'd make you wash all the dishes.

13:58.272 --> 14:01.673
- Poor babies.
- But, look, you're almost done.

14:03.277 --> 14:07.907
Oops! Sorry. See? I can apologize.

14:07.982 --> 14:11.042
Well, that's because
you're the bigger person.

14:14.122 --> 14:16.613
That's it! Forget Taylor Kingsford.

14:16.691 --> 14:19.159
I'm going after them
and don't you try and stop me.

14:19.227 --> 14:21.559
Who's stopping ya? I'm with ya!

14:22.463 --> 14:24.124
Sorry, Dad. Get the flea dip ready,

14:24.198 --> 14:27.167
because tonight
I'm lying down with the dogs.

14:34.342 --> 14:35.502
Linda.

14:36.511 --> 14:39.309
Come on out, Linda,
nobody's gonna hurt you.

14:39.380 --> 14:42.440
- Come on.
- Come on, Dad, that's ridiculous.

14:46.054 --> 14:48.079
This is how you catch a mouse.

14:48.156 --> 14:50.716
Two hundred and forty-eight traps.

14:51.959 --> 14:55.588
Very impressive, Son.
Can you come over here for a second?

14:58.933 --> 15:02.027
Oh, all right.
Okay, I know what you're thinking.

15:02.103 --> 15:05.266
But I got the brains
to get myself out of this one.

15:05.339 --> 15:08.502
See, that's the difference between me
and a mouse.

15:22.857 --> 15:26.657
I think the difference is
the mouse would've made that jump.

15:42.744 --> 15:43.972
What was that?

15:44.045 --> 15:45.376
Ashley?

15:46.214 --> 15:48.478
Ashley. Ashley.

15:50.051 --> 15:53.885
Move your hand.
I can't see your answers.

15:55.590 --> 15:56.579
Ow!

15:57.859 --> 16:00.726
- What's going on?
- I think I heard something outside!

16:00.795 --> 16:03.093
It was probably just the wind.

16:04.432 --> 16:06.059
Or not.

16:06.134 --> 16:08.466
- Mr. Picker! Mr. Picker!
- Mr. Picker! Mr. Picker!

16:08.536 --> 16:09.901
- Mr. Picker!
- Mr. Picker!

16:10.371 --> 16:13.135
Twelve more hours,
your own bathroom.

16:13.207 --> 16:14.834
You can do it.

16:17.779 --> 16:19.940
- What is that thing?
- I don't know.

16:20.014 --> 16:22.608
It could be a bear or a mountain lion.

16:22.683 --> 16:24.776
Whatever it is, it sounds hungry.

16:25.987 --> 16:28.080
But I'm too pretty to get eaten!

16:28.156 --> 16:30.249
Hey, I'm pretty, too!

16:30.324 --> 16:32.815
Well, I'll mention that at your funeral!

16:32.894 --> 16:35.624
- Lilly, wish me luck.
- Miley, what are you doing?

16:35.696 --> 16:37.857
If we stay here,
we'll all get torn to pieces.

16:37.932 --> 16:42.028
Our only hope is if I can get to
the ranger station alive.

16:42.937 --> 16:45.497
This is stupid. I just can't let you go.

16:45.573 --> 16:47.666
- But we can!
- Go, go! Be stupid!

16:47.742 --> 16:51.075
Don't worry, I'm gonna be just fine!

16:54.749 --> 16:57.240
- Thanks for the help.
- Anything to get out of Donny's tent.

16:57.318 --> 17:00.719
He got a standing ovation
from the skunks.

17:00.788 --> 17:03.018
Oh, no, you don't! Yeah, that's right!

17:03.090 --> 17:05.558
Not so tough now, are ya?

17:05.626 --> 17:07.218
My leg!

17:08.963 --> 17:09.987
Ow!

17:10.064 --> 17:11.622
My other leg!

17:12.934 --> 17:14.799
My arm!

17:16.704 --> 17:19.002
- Okay, you go next.
- Why me?

17:19.073 --> 17:22.098
I think we've established
the "pretty scale. "

17:22.877 --> 17:26.210
- Lilly, he's got me!
- Oh, no, he doesn't!

17:26.280 --> 17:27.804
It's too late. Goodbye!

17:28.983 --> 17:30.473
No, Miley, no!

17:30.551 --> 17:32.781
You let her go, you...

17:43.831 --> 17:44.820
Hey!

17:44.899 --> 17:46.196
<i>Ocupado!</i>

17:46.601 --> 17:47.966
Get out!

17:48.035 --> 17:50.128
You get out!

17:58.012 --> 17:59.274
Yeah!

18:00.781 --> 18:02.976
Looks like Daddy was wrong.

18:03.050 --> 18:06.178
I got down with the dogs
and got up flea free.

18:25.907 --> 18:27.238
Got ya!

18:30.011 --> 18:32.571
That little sucker's laughing at me.

18:35.850 --> 18:38.011
Oh, your tail is mine now.

18:41.956 --> 18:43.423
What the...

18:46.661 --> 18:49.152
Way to go, Dad, I'll take it from here.

18:49.230 --> 18:52.666
All right, my little rodent friend,
kiss your whiskers goodbye.

18:52.733 --> 18:53.825
Whoa, Son.

18:53.901 --> 18:56.995
You don't kill a mouse
with that kind of talent.

18:57.605 --> 19:02.201
Linda, you know <i>Achy Breaky Heart?</i>

19:03.477 --> 19:05.377
<i>The other side, the other side</i>

19:05.446 --> 19:07.346
<i>The other side of me</i>

19:07.415 --> 19:11.579
<i>The other side, the other side</i>
<i>I want you to see</i>

19:11.652 --> 19:15.213
<i>The other side, the other side of me</i>

19:17.758 --> 19:19.282
That was Hannah Montana.

19:20.461 --> 19:22.588
And in a minute we're coming back
with the real thing.

19:22.663 --> 19:24.995
So please stay tuned,
because I love you!

19:25.066 --> 19:27.534
I mean it! I really do!

19:28.669 --> 19:30.296
And we're clear.

19:30.371 --> 19:33.306
There you are, there you are,
looking so fine!

19:33.374 --> 19:34.932
How you doing?

19:35.609 --> 19:37.372
And who is your right-hand lady?

19:39.547 --> 19:43.244
- Is she all right?
- I ask myself that question every day.

19:44.752 --> 19:45.912
Stay!

19:48.389 --> 19:49.947
Hey, Oliver? What do you want?
I'm kind of busy.

19:50.024 --> 19:53.323
It's important! Remember that bush
we were standing in?

19:53.394 --> 19:55.123
It's poison oak!

19:55.196 --> 19:56.857
What? That's crazy.

19:56.931 --> 20:00.094
If it was then I'd be doing this.

20:01.102 --> 20:02.865
Hey, baby girl,
if you want to be on the show,

20:02.937 --> 20:05.337
you need to be on the stage.

20:05.406 --> 20:06.805
Gotta go.

20:08.809 --> 20:12.245
Okay, no, just because he said it...
I mean...

20:12.880 --> 20:14.404
Lilly isn't...

20:16.384 --> 20:17.476
We're back!

20:17.585 --> 20:20.076
- Three, two...
- Oh, boy.

20:20.154 --> 20:22.213
And we're back with Hannah Montana.

20:23.557 --> 20:25.388
- Hannah, welcome to the show.
- Thank you.

20:25.459 --> 20:27.620
I have been itching
to ask you a few questions.

20:27.695 --> 20:29.458
And I'm itching
to answer them.

20:29.530 --> 20:32.192
You always come across
so sweet as apple pie.

20:32.266 --> 20:34.166
And America loves apple pie.
We love apple pie.

20:34.235 --> 20:38.296
But is that the true Hannah Montana?
Is that the real you? We'd like to know.

20:38.372 --> 20:42.433
Well, I've always believed that
at the end of the day,

20:42.510 --> 20:46.241
it's about loving each other
as you would love yourself.

20:47.114 --> 20:48.138
Boring!

20:48.215 --> 20:50.376
Come on,
I mean, haven't you ever got down

20:50.451 --> 20:52.851
and done something so bad?

20:52.920 --> 20:55.320
Well, you know, I've learned

20:55.689 --> 20:56.747
recently

20:56.824 --> 21:00.282
that if you get down with the dog,
you end up with fleas.

21:02.396 --> 21:04.762
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, never better!

21:04.832 --> 21:08.097
It's just this... A new dance routine
I've been working on,

21:08.169 --> 21:10.034
and I just can't wait to show it to ya.

21:10.104 --> 21:13.198
- Does it come with a song?
- If you want.

21:13.274 --> 21:15.799
How about that, a Taylor Kingsford
sneak peek right here!

21:15.876 --> 21:17.571
All right, all I need is a beat!

21:17.645 --> 21:19.112
- Come on, band, help her out!
- Okay.

21:20.247 --> 21:22.374
Give me that mike! Thank you. Okay.

21:23.317 --> 21:28.254
<i> Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!</i>
<i>Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!</i>

21:28.322 --> 21:31.223
I call it the Scratch dance!
Contagious, isn't it?

21:31.292 --> 21:33.852
Everybody's doing it. See?

21:33.928 --> 21:35.896
Just scratch my back!

21:36.263 --> 21:38.197
Okay! All right!

21:38.466 --> 21:39.899
<i> A little to the left</i>

21:40.468 --> 21:42.698
<i>Now a little to the right</i>

21:42.770 --> 21:46.433
<i>Lower, higher, now, that's just right!</i>

21:46.507 --> 21:48.668
I can't watch this.

21:48.742 --> 21:52.143
- <i> Oh, yeah!</i>
- You don't have to. I'm recording it.

21:52.213 --> 21:55.239
I never get tired
of watching me be right!

21:56.550 --> 21:58.916
- Now switch!
- You wish.

22:00.121 --> 22:03.090
- Scratch dancing! Scratch dancing!
- Scratch dancing! Scratch dancing!

22:04.125 --> 22:05.387
- <i>Oh, yeah. </i>
- Scratch dancing!

22:05.459 --> 22:07.757
Scratch dancing! It's contagious!

22:07.828 --> 22:09.352
- It's contagious!
- If you don't stop,

22:09.430 --> 22:11.796
you're going to find out!

22:11.866 --> 22:13.390
Come on, little girl, bring it!

22:13.467 --> 22:16.493
- Come on, come on!
- I'm gonna get you!

22:20.040 --> 22:22.133
- Scratch that!
- That's it!

22:24.712 --> 22:26.543
Very funny, Linda.
