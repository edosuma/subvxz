TO CELEBRATE

47:58.042 --> 47:59.544
AFTER I GOT MARRIED.

47:59.585 --> 48:01.045
YOU GOT MARRIED?

48:01.086 --> 48:04.131
EARLIER, IN TAHOE.

48:04.173 --> 48:07.051
WHERE'S YOUR WIFE?

48:07.092 --> 48:09.428
I LEFT HER IN THE MOTEL ROOM.

48:11.514 --> 48:14.016
DO YOU MIND

48:11.514 --> 48:14.016
STEPPING OUT OF THE CAR, PLEASE?

48:16.143 --> 48:18.062
EARLIER TODAY I CAUGHT MY WIFE--

48:18.103 --> 48:22.608
MY--MY FIANCEE...

48:22.650 --> 48:25.737
I WALKED IN ON HER

48:22.650 --> 48:25.737
CHEATING ON ME.

48:25.778 --> 48:27.112
BUT YOU MARRIED HER?

48:27.154 --> 48:28.614
WHAT'S GOING THROUGH

48:27.154 --> 48:28.614
YOUR HEAD, SON?

48:28.656 --> 48:29.699
I DON'T KNOW.

48:29.741 --> 48:32.034
SHE WAS THE ONE I THOUGHT I'D...

48:32.076 --> 48:33.118
SPEND FOREVER WITH.

48:35.329 --> 48:36.831
WELL...

48:36.873 --> 48:38.791
DON'T TELL ME

48:36.873 --> 48:38.791
YOU'RE...

48:38.833 --> 48:40.042
GOING BACK TO

48:38.833 --> 48:40.042
WHERE YOU CAME FROM

48:40.084 --> 48:43.003
TO KILL THE GUY?

48:43.045 --> 48:46.215
IT WAS A WOMAN.

48:58.269 --> 49:01.898
YOU EVER WATCH

48:58.269 --> 49:01.898
PORNOGRAPHY?

49:01.938 --> 49:03.441
UH...

49:03.482 --> 49:04.650
YOU DON'T HAVE

49:03.482 --> 49:04.650
TO ANSWER THAT.

49:04.692 --> 49:07.486
WE ALL DO.

49:07.528 --> 49:08.863
YOU KNOW, WE SPEND

49:07.528 --> 49:08.863
OUR WHOLE LIVES

49:08.905 --> 49:09.906
WATCHING PORN,

49:09.946 --> 49:12.825
AND WE NEVER SEE

49:09.946 --> 49:12.825
THE WARNING,

49:12.867 --> 49:14.118
BUT THERE IT IS.

49:14.159 --> 49:15.494
YOU KNOW THAT SCENE

49:15.536 --> 49:16.913
WHERE TWO WOMEN

49:15.536 --> 49:16.913
ARE GETTING IT ON,

49:16.953 --> 49:18.790
THE GUY COMES IN,

49:16.953 --> 49:18.790
HE'S ALL HARD, YOU KNOW,

49:18.831 --> 49:20.082
HE'S GONNA

49:18.831 --> 49:20.082
GIVE IT TO 'EM.

49:20.124 --> 49:23.920
HE'S GONNA

49:20.124 --> 49:23.920
FUCK 'EM GOOD.

49:23.960 --> 49:25.922
WE THINK THAT'S WHAT

49:23.960 --> 49:25.922
THOSE CHICKS WANT,

49:25.962 --> 49:27.548
THE MEAT...

49:29.174 --> 49:30.509
BUT YOU LOOK

49:29.174 --> 49:30.509
CLOSELY NEXT TIME.

49:30.551 --> 49:31.928
THAT'S NOT IT.

49:31.968 --> 49:33.304
THEY'RE HAVIN'

49:31.968 --> 49:33.304
A GOOD TIME WITHOUT HIM.

49:33.345 --> 49:35.306
THEY'RE GOING DOWN

49:33.345 --> 49:35.306
ON EACH OTHER,

49:35.347 --> 49:36.766
YOU KNOW, THEY'RE...

49:36.808 --> 49:38.016
THEY'RE UP IN THERE,

49:38.058 --> 49:39.059
THEY'RE LICKING

49:38.058 --> 49:39.059
EVERYTHING,

49:39.101 --> 49:40.352
AND THE GUY

49:39.101 --> 49:40.352
COMES IN,

49:40.394 --> 49:41.938
HE'S READY

49:40.394 --> 49:41.938
TO UNLOAD.

49:41.978 --> 49:43.481
THAT'S NOT

49:41.978 --> 49:43.481
WHAT THEY WANT.

49:43.522 --> 49:45.065
THEY GOT THEIR

49:43.522 --> 49:45.065
EYES SQUINTED UP,

49:45.107 --> 49:51.363
LIKE SOMEONE'S GOING

49:45.107 --> 49:51.363
TO POUR GASOLINE ON 'EM.

49:51.405 --> 49:54.909
THERE'S YOUR WARNING.

49:57.035 --> 49:58.203
THAT'S WHY

49:57.035 --> 49:58.203
THIS COUNTRY'S HOMOSEXUALS

49:58.245 --> 50:00.289
ARE SO DANGEROUS.

50:05.001 --> 50:06.879
WHEN YOU GOT

50:05.001 --> 50:06.879
TWO PEOPLE,

50:06.921 --> 50:09.381
AND THEY GOT

50:06.921 --> 50:09.381
THE SAME EQUIPMENT,

50:09.423 --> 50:13.678
AND THEY BOTH

50:09.423 --> 50:13.678
KNOW HOW TO TREAT IT,

50:13.719 --> 50:15.220
HOW CAN ANYBODY

50:13.719 --> 50:15.220
OF THE OPPOSITE SEX

50:15.262 --> 50:17.932
COMPETE WITH THAT?

50:17.974 --> 50:20.058
THAT'S HOW

50:17.974 --> 50:20.058
THEY GET YOU.

50:23.646 --> 50:25.648
YOU, UH...

50:25.690 --> 50:28.943
TRY TO DRIVE

50:25.690 --> 50:28.943
THE SPEED LIMIT, OKAY?

50:31.403 --> 50:33.948
I WILL.

50:47.753 --> 50:50.130
