WEBVTT

00:01.126 --> 00:04.790
So that's why I can't ever
kiss her lips again.

00:04.922 --> 00:06.163
Simple mathematics.

00:06.298 --> 00:08.290
Now, who can solve this problem?

00:09.801 --> 00:10.801
Gary?

00:10.802 --> 00:13.340
I think I left my penis
in the bathroom.

00:13.472 --> 00:14.347
Can I go get it?

00:14.348 --> 00:17.216
Here.
You can use mine.

00:17.351 --> 00:20.389
We can't give Gary help.
Night school isn't for friends.

00:20.521 --> 00:21.728
It's for killers.

00:21.855 --> 00:23.972
Can I take
this course over?

00:24.107 --> 00:28.067
Yeah, if this is, like,
what you want to do forever.

00:28.195 --> 00:30.608
My mommy thinks
I'm living at my uncle's.

00:30.739 --> 00:32.070
She thinks I'm good.

00:32.198 --> 00:35.067
Well, Gary?
Are you?

00:38.705 --> 00:39.705
How did I oversleep?

00:39.748 --> 00:40.748
Shit!

00:42.000 --> 00:48.074

01:11.530 --> 01:16.070
Where... aw, come... I told you
<i>I</i> was taking the car!

01:16.201 --> 01:18.784
I thought maybe
you wanted a cup of sugar,

01:18.912 --> 01:21.700
or maybe to see if Rocco
could come out and play.

01:21.832 --> 01:23.994
I didn't think for a second
you had the balls.

01:24.126 --> 01:25.287
The fucking arrogance.

01:25.419 --> 01:26.751
No, it's really offensive.

01:26.878 --> 01:29.165
Like, what, you're better
than him? But you're not.

01:29.298 --> 01:31.711
You think you can just
drop by my home...

01:31.842 --> 01:34.050
<i>my home</i>... and ask me this?

01:34.177 --> 01:35.509
Oh, I'm not asking.

01:35.637 --> 01:38.755
You're gonna dismantle this
not-even-close-to-a-secret lair

01:38.890 --> 01:39.926
and leave town.

01:40.058 --> 01:41.674
Or die in this crappy office

01:41.810 --> 01:43.551
that is disappointingly
not whale-shaped

01:43.687 --> 01:45.053
or hovering
or anything cool.

01:45.188 --> 01:46.645
Are you serious?

01:46.773 --> 01:48.059
I'm the Blue Morpho.

01:48.191 --> 01:50.854
I know, dipshit.
I read the trades.

01:50.986 --> 01:52.466
Hold on, a-are you late
for something?

01:52.529 --> 01:54.236
No, just checking the time.

01:54.364 --> 01:57.903
You see, in 10 seconds,
you'll be bleeding to death,

01:58.035 --> 01:59.992
and you'll be unconscious.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.737
Abort! Abort!
Abort the mission!

02:02.873 --> 02:05.160
I'm not even
at Grove Street yet!

02:05.292 --> 02:07.454
Three. Two.

02:07.586 --> 02:09.327
And one.

02:09.920 --> 02:10.920
Ah!

02:10.964 --> 02:12.500
Ha ha ha!

02:12.633 --> 02:13.874
- Shit.
- That's it.

02:14.009 --> 02:15.216
Kano, get

02:16.887 --> 02:18.906
I can't believe I caught
that knife on the first try.

02:18.930 --> 02:21.593
Aah! So cool!

02:30.567 --> 02:32.183
Listen, please!

02:32.319 --> 02:35.107
It's just till we have
the Blue Morpho in custody!

02:35.238 --> 02:36.774
No more arching?

02:36.907 --> 02:38.569
How do you expect us
to make a living?

02:38.700 --> 02:41.909
What, do you expect me
to get a job at Tower Records?

02:42.037 --> 02:45.326
Well, there are none!
And also I'm made of ectoplasm.

02:45.457 --> 02:48.495
Please, please, everyone,
it's for your own safety!

02:48.627 --> 02:51.836
My only skills are
brick throwing and frog being!

02:51.963 --> 02:54.296
We don't plan on taking away
anyone's livelihoods.

02:54.424 --> 02:57.087
No reason to start a panic here.

02:57.219 --> 02:59.711
Start a panic?
I'm leading an investigation.

02:59.846 --> 03:01.587
I'm just asking
for some cooperation.

03:01.723 --> 03:04.511
And they'd love to cooperate,
Councilwoman.

03:04.643 --> 03:08.227
Free dues for a year
and your weight in Guild booty

03:08.355 --> 03:10.187
for the head
of the Blue Morpho!

03:10.315 --> 03:12.398
Let's get flaming bricks!

03:12.526 --> 03:14.563
Let's get pitchforks
like in "Dracula"!

03:14.695 --> 03:15.775
No, like in "Frankenstein"!

03:15.821 --> 03:17.107
Torches!
Like in "Dracula"!

03:17.239 --> 03:19.026
I'm telling you,
it's "Frankenstein"!

03:23.161 --> 03:26.745
You all know me.
You know how I earn a living.

03:26.873 --> 03:28.865
I'll catch this Blue Morpho
for you,

03:29.000 --> 03:30.241
but it's not gonna be easy.

03:30.377 --> 03:33.040
He's not playing
by your Guild rules.

03:33.171 --> 03:34.753
He'll slice you open,
anus to throat,

03:34.881 --> 03:37.214
and wash his hands
in your spilling bowels.

03:37.342 --> 03:38.458
Let's get this over with.

03:38.593 --> 03:41.006
You can get back
to pretending you're bad.

03:41.138 --> 03:43.721
But as for your reward
of free dues...

03:43.849 --> 03:46.762
Free dues
and mugs with our logo on it!

03:46.893 --> 03:48.054
Your weight in mugs!

03:48.186 --> 03:50.052
I want a seat on your council.

03:50.188 --> 03:52.805
For that,
I'll give you Blue Morpho.

03:52.941 --> 03:56.651
Or at least
his blood-soaked head!

03:56.778 --> 04:00.146
Ah. Thank you very much,
Mr., uh, Death.

04:00.282 --> 04:03.650
We'll, uh, take that
under advisement.

04:05.787 --> 04:07.403
Nice job there, Rocco.

04:07.539 --> 04:09.121
Yeah, back when
I was with Angie,

04:09.249 --> 04:12.037
she was into this kind of, uh,
getting-tied-up thing.

04:12.169 --> 04:13.785
- I got good at it.
- No? Angie?

04:13.920 --> 04:17.129
Yeah! Oh, she was like... oh ho!
Oh, you have no idea.

04:17.257 --> 04:18.793
Angie?
From Lyndhurst?

04:18.925 --> 04:20.712
You have no idea.

04:20.844 --> 04:23.803
Wake up, mystery man!

04:23.930 --> 04:25.717
Ah! Ah! Ah!
Okay! Okay! Ah!

04:25.849 --> 04:29.013
You'd think
I'd pull that stupid mask off

04:29.144 --> 04:32.478
and be all, "Bruce Wayne?
No friggin' way!"

04:32.606 --> 04:34.063
But I like the anticipation.

04:34.191 --> 04:36.399
I like the riddle.

04:36.526 --> 04:38.984
Yeah, that little mask
covers around his eyes.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.728
Like now we don't know
who he is.

04:40.864 --> 04:44.107
Right? That's the only way
we can identify each other.

04:44.242 --> 04:45.483
Eye sockets.

04:45.619 --> 04:46.699
Hey, look.
Hey, Rocco, look.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.904
- Look at my disguise.
- Who are you?

04:49.039 --> 04:50.701
I ain't never
seen this guy before.

04:50.832 --> 04:51.868
Where's Wide Wale?

04:52.000 --> 04:54.117
Oh! It was me the whole time!

04:54.252 --> 04:55.730
All right, all right,
I get it. I get it!

04:55.754 --> 04:58.121
Now, now, now. No spoilers!

04:58.256 --> 05:00.248
We can do this using logic.

05:00.383 --> 05:02.215
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
like Sherlock Holmes.

05:02.344 --> 05:04.256
Hey, Dr. Watson,

05:04.387 --> 05:06.629
doesn't this shithead
sound familiar?

05:06.765 --> 05:09.257
Yeah. He sounds like
that Monarch guy.

05:09.392 --> 05:10.883
Like a tiny bit.

05:11.019 --> 05:12.976
No? Monarch?

05:13.104 --> 05:16.313
Whew, I hope, for this guy's
sake, he ain't the Monarch.

05:16.441 --> 05:18.252
- Oh, yeah, why's that?
- W-Why would that matter?

05:18.276 --> 05:19.754
Oh, I ain't never
told you this before?

05:19.778 --> 05:22.486
My origin story?
Ah, you two will love this.

05:22.614 --> 05:23.980
Okay.

05:24.115 --> 05:25.235
As hard as it is to believe,

05:25.367 --> 05:28.075
I wasn't born
half a fucking whale.

05:28.203 --> 05:31.787
Did you know that 95%
of our oceans are unexplored?

05:31.915 --> 05:34.498
My brother Doug used to say
that everything worth knowing

05:34.626 --> 05:36.208
was in that 95%.

05:36.336 --> 05:39.875
Like, uh, sharks have this shit
called angiogenin inhibitors

05:40.006 --> 05:41.793
that makes them
all but immune to cancer?

05:41.925 --> 05:44.918
It's all scientific, and that
was really Dougie's department.

05:45.053 --> 05:46.794
He was a fucking genius,

05:46.930 --> 05:49.968
and I was the only one
that truly believed in him.

05:50.100 --> 05:51.100
So this one time...

05:51.142 --> 05:53.008
Okay,
just a little further.

05:53.144 --> 05:56.512
And surprise!
The final piece!

05:56.648 --> 06:00.642
Oh, no, Chester, this won't do.
I-It's falling apart.

06:00.777 --> 06:02.171
Where did you get
this wretched thing?

06:02.195 --> 06:04.938
It's art. I stole it from
one of those snooty galleries.

06:05.073 --> 06:06.905
It's worth like
12 million bucks,

06:07.033 --> 06:08.649
so that means
it's the best, right?

06:08.785 --> 06:11.152
Use your eyes!
It's a pile of garbage.

06:11.288 --> 06:13.655
We can't use this!
This is worthless.

06:13.790 --> 06:15.031
Only a fool
would want this.

06:15.166 --> 06:17.499
This is my older
brother calling me a fool.

06:17.627 --> 06:19.584
My heart was just exploding.

06:19.713 --> 06:20.874
I-I had to make it right.

06:21.006 --> 06:22.042
So that night,

06:22.173 --> 06:25.132
I hooked up the molecular
redistributor to myself.

06:27.470 --> 06:30.338
Chester! No!
No, what are you doing?!

06:30.473 --> 06:32.260
Dougie,
you got to trust me!

06:32.392 --> 06:34.224
You got to trust
your calculations!

06:34.352 --> 06:37.186
Wait, wait, no.
You did tell me this story.

06:37.314 --> 06:38.521
I remember this part.

06:38.648 --> 06:39.934
Yeah, I remember it too.

06:40.066 --> 06:41.807
Or maybe I'm thinking
of the Hulk.

06:41.943 --> 06:43.275
It's not exactly unique.

06:43.403 --> 06:46.862
And what does it have to do
with this, uh, Monarch guy?

06:46.990 --> 06:48.151
Oh, am I boring you?

06:48.283 --> 06:50.866
I'm sorry.
Let me get to that part.

06:50.994 --> 06:52.860
So, anyway, I become
a supervillain,

06:52.996 --> 06:54.737
and Doug becomes
a super-scientist,

06:54.873 --> 06:56.455
we part ways, yada, yada.

06:56.583 --> 07:00.497
So Dr. Doug Ong...
Dr. Dugong...

07:00.629 --> 07:03.167
had this new arch, the Monarch.

07:03.298 --> 07:06.041
Can you guess what he did?

07:06.176 --> 07:07.758
You abandoned me!

07:07.886 --> 07:09.923
You abandoned my hatred!

07:10.055 --> 07:11.512
I-I have cuttlefish.

07:11.640 --> 07:14.348
Look into my eyes!

07:16.353 --> 07:17.514
Eh...

07:17.646 --> 07:21.981
So this Monarch guy
blew my brother's head off.

07:22.108 --> 07:23.895
You don't want to be him.

07:24.027 --> 07:25.393
I may look like a whale,

07:25.528 --> 07:29.147
but I got a lot of
bad shark in me.

07:29.282 --> 07:30.989
Yes.

07:31.117 --> 07:32.733
S-Surprise? Ow!

07:33.620 --> 07:35.577
They are whaling on him.

07:35.705 --> 07:37.992
Whaling.
That's kind of funny.

07:38.124 --> 07:40.019
Oh, if he lives through this,
he's gonna kill me.

07:45.173 --> 07:48.257
Be aggressive.
B-E aggressive. B-E...

07:48.385 --> 07:49.737
<i>Yes, yes, it's hilarious.</i>

07:49.761 --> 07:51.321
<i>You're like
the third person to do that.</i>

07:51.429 --> 07:52.465
<i>Are you with my husband?</i>

07:52.597 --> 07:54.213
Eh, kinda?

07:54.349 --> 07:56.807
<i>Get to
Rat Island immediately.</i>

07:56.935 --> 07:59.723
<i>They caught the Blue Morpho.</i>

08:04.442 --> 08:05.853
Which one of you
captured him?

08:05.986 --> 08:07.272
It was Tunnel Vision!

08:07.404 --> 08:09.270
Yeah, I was just tunneling
Rat Island there,

08:09.406 --> 08:10.567
and then this guy pops out.

08:10.699 --> 08:12.315
It's him.
Blue Morpho.

08:12.450 --> 08:14.908
There's, uh, probably
a secret lair around here.

08:15.036 --> 08:16.516
If he didn't
self-destruct it already.

08:16.621 --> 08:19.955
My hand, if you could see it,
is extended in gratitude.

08:20.083 --> 08:23.326
That's a homeless guy dressed up
kind of like the Blue Morpho.

08:23.461 --> 08:26.249
This is ridiculous!
This is a Halloween mask!

08:26.381 --> 08:27.497
A what?!

08:27.632 --> 08:29.715
This is crazy.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.254
The Blue Morpho
is still out there.

08:31.386 --> 08:32.672
You got to help me find him.

08:32.804 --> 08:34.886
I was just gonna almost
ask you the same thing.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.847
That isn't him,
and you know it.

08:36.975 --> 08:38.174
If we take this away
from them,

08:38.226 --> 08:40.183
we'll get energy lasers,
acid spit,

08:40.311 --> 08:41.768
and a frog
throwing a brick at us.

08:41.895 --> 08:44.263
This nightmare is over.

08:44.399 --> 08:48.313
"Guild," as you know,
means "fellowship."

08:49.320 --> 08:51.312
Dr. Mrs. the Monarch?

08:51.448 --> 08:52.529
Yes?

08:54.034 --> 08:55.366
I just found out

08:55.493 --> 08:59.077
Harangutan was killed
by the Blue Morpho.

08:59.205 --> 09:00.321
And you knew it.

09:00.457 --> 09:03.291
You knew there was
a vigilante out there,

09:03.418 --> 09:05.330
but you let villains arch.

09:05.462 --> 09:07.795
You knew all those things,

09:07.922 --> 09:12.166
and now my Wandering Spider
is dead.

09:12.302 --> 09:16.012
I wanted you to know that.

09:16.139 --> 09:18.096
You did not deserve that.

09:18.224 --> 09:20.011
I-I have to show you
a few things.

09:20.143 --> 09:22.226
Meet me back at our place.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.733
Hey, Sirena, I got to ask you
to go to your room there.

09:29.861 --> 09:30.977
Your father, he, uh...

09:31.112 --> 09:32.694
I can't even
sit in the living room?!

09:32.822 --> 09:34.108
Oh, this is so stupid.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.981
You're stupid,
and this is stupid.

09:36.117 --> 09:37.449
Hey, look, it's not me.

09:37.577 --> 09:40.115
It's the Blue Morpho thing
and your dad.

09:40.246 --> 09:42.533
If it was me,
I'd put you up in the Plaza

09:42.665 --> 09:44.782
with every
Nintendo game they got.

09:44.918 --> 09:47.251
Rocco, what year
do you think this is?

09:47.378 --> 09:49.290
Nintendo? What are we,
in the fucking '90s?

09:49.422 --> 09:52.711
- Then a PS2 or whatever.
- That came out forever ago.

09:52.842 --> 09:55.425
Ugh! Fine! Tell my dad
you tied me to the bed.

09:55.553 --> 09:57.465
Don't you even
joke about that!

09:57.597 --> 09:59.338
Is someone
doing that to you, Sirena?!

09:59.474 --> 10:01.794
Sirena, you would tell me if
someone was doing that to you!

10:01.851 --> 10:03.934
<i>- Rocco?</i>
- Yeah, boss?

10:04.062 --> 10:05.974
<i>Want to play
with the rat again?</i>

10:06.106 --> 10:09.315
Wide Wale?
He's Wide Wale's prisoner?

10:09.442 --> 10:12.310
- What are you morons thinking?
- He did it for you!

10:12.445 --> 10:15.153
You were suddenly
Mrs. Guild of Calamitous Intent,

10:15.281 --> 10:16.281
and he was Mr. Nobody!

10:16.407 --> 10:18.273
Why does that
make sense to you?!

10:18.409 --> 10:20.901
That is the dumbest
fucking thing I've ever heard!

10:21.037 --> 10:23.154
His father
was the Blue Morpho,

10:23.289 --> 10:25.372
so he kills my colleagues...
for me?!

10:25.500 --> 10:26.741
It's dumb!
We're dumb!

10:26.876 --> 10:28.617
He did a dumb thing!
We're idiots!

10:28.753 --> 10:30.540
But just look at what he did!

10:30.672 --> 10:31.879
He's a Guild legend!

10:32.006 --> 10:34.373
He has every one of those
bullshit fake villains

10:34.509 --> 10:35.625
peeing in their tights!

10:35.760 --> 10:38.298
Yeah, he's a hero, Gary.
Tell that to Wide Wale.

10:38.429 --> 10:39.761
If he doesn't get murdered,

10:39.889 --> 10:42.472
then it's my job
to publicly execute him!

10:42.600 --> 10:45.809
Okay, okay, I get it, I get it.
We'll come up with a plan.

10:45.937 --> 10:48.054
We always do.
You know.

10:48.189 --> 10:49.225
Go, Team Monarch?

10:49.357 --> 10:51.519
I c... I can't...

10:51.651 --> 10:53.392
How did you even
pull this crap off?

10:53.528 --> 10:55.770
Well, you want to
see something?

11:02.662 --> 11:04.494
Oh, there's
the damn water heater!

11:04.622 --> 11:05.954
What is that,
a 20-gallon tank?

11:06.082 --> 11:07.962
No wonder I can only take
a three-minute shower.

11:08.084 --> 11:10.622
- What the hell? There was stuff!
- It's impressive.

11:10.753 --> 11:13.496
You two play make-believe
in the basement. Neato.

11:13.631 --> 11:15.372
Wait, where...
where are you going?

11:15.508 --> 11:17.591
To get some real help.

11:23.391 --> 11:25.758
Come on! Join me!

11:25.894 --> 11:27.510
Are you kidding?
It's freezing.

11:27.645 --> 11:29.261
Do this alone, you jackass.

11:29.397 --> 11:30.888
Oh, you are never
there for me!

11:35.153 --> 11:36.564
I'm drowning!

11:36.696 --> 11:40.815
There he is.
There's our vigilante.

11:40.950 --> 11:42.737
Did you have
a nice little rest?

11:42.869 --> 11:45.486
My teeth are loose.
You keep punching.

11:45.622 --> 11:48.160
Does baby always
wake up this grumpy?

11:48.291 --> 11:51.034
Seriously.
Use chloroform or something.

11:51.169 --> 11:52.729
Did you ever hear
of a brain hemorrhage?

11:52.837 --> 11:55.045
You're right.
I want to watch you die.

11:55.173 --> 11:56.789
But I want it to be big.

11:56.925 --> 11:59.508
Big and poetic.
You deserve that.

11:59.636 --> 12:02.253
<i>Hai ucciso mio fratello.</i>

12:02.388 --> 12:05.131
I don't speak Italian.
How do you even know Italian?

12:05.266 --> 12:07.508
I mean, isn't your name Chinese?
Ong?

12:07.644 --> 12:09.351
It's English.
My wife was Italian.

12:09.479 --> 12:10.845
April?
April was Italian?

12:10.980 --> 12:12.221
What?
Of course she was Italian.

12:12.357 --> 12:13.797
She was Italian
on her mother's side.

12:13.900 --> 12:15.357
You sure of that, boss?
April?

12:15.485 --> 12:17.522
A-And I spent some time abroad
in college.

12:17.654 --> 12:18.770
You know, work study.

12:18.905 --> 12:21.613
Yeah, yeah. One of my henchmen
went to London for a week.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.323
He came back
with an accent too.

12:23.451 --> 12:25.534
He was all,
"I'm rather chuffed."

12:25.662 --> 12:26.764
Total douche.

12:26.788 --> 12:28.404
Oh, I hate guys like that.

12:28.539 --> 12:30.155
They're just trying
to get laid.

12:30.291 --> 12:33.159
"Hey, ladies,
I'm from le France!"

12:33.294 --> 12:35.707
"These American boys, so crude.

12:35.838 --> 12:38.205
Let me touch your bosom,
<i>s'il vous plaÃ®t."</i>

12:39.634 --> 12:43.423
It was the University
of, uh, uh, Palermo.

12:43.554 --> 12:44.590
Work study.

12:44.722 --> 12:47.305
Yeah, right, work study.

12:47.433 --> 12:49.390
Come here,
you little rascal.

12:51.521 --> 12:52.728
Gotcha!

12:53.731 --> 12:55.643
These are your daddy's
work friends, honey.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.232
Gary, meet Lila.

12:57.360 --> 12:58.476
Well, look at you.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.227
You're as cute
as a button.

13:00.363 --> 13:04.528
Yes, she is.
Especially her belly button!

13:07.287 --> 13:08.994
Oh, and this is...

13:09.122 --> 13:10.738
Oh. Uh, Sheila.

13:10.873 --> 13:12.080
Hello, young lady.

13:12.208 --> 13:14.074
Ohh.

13:14.210 --> 13:15.451
I'll ask.

13:15.586 --> 13:17.748
She wants to know
if you're a princess.

13:17.880 --> 13:21.499
Oh, I am not. I'm a...
I work with your daddy.

13:21.634 --> 13:23.466
There you go, sweetheart.

13:23.594 --> 13:26.758
Now go ask mommy if
you can have a cupcake, okay?

13:28.558 --> 13:29.594
She's beautiful.

13:29.726 --> 13:31.763
Your husband is alive.

13:31.894 --> 13:33.510
- Told you!
- You are so lucky.

13:33.646 --> 13:34.932
But just barely.

13:35.064 --> 13:36.771
He made the unfortunate
career choice

13:36.899 --> 13:41.564
of killing Wide Wale's brother
some time ago, a one Dr. Dugong.

13:41.696 --> 13:44.154
That's his brother?
I remember that.

13:44.282 --> 13:45.773
I wasn't even on that arch.

13:45.908 --> 13:47.490
That was you
and the lousy Moppets.

13:47.618 --> 13:49.178
I'm in the clear.

13:49.203 --> 13:51.035
Uh, okay, yeah,
this isn't good.

13:51.164 --> 13:52.996
I will help you
rescue your husband.

13:53.124 --> 13:55.491
But after that, I'm taking
his head to the Guild.

13:55.626 --> 13:58.369
I want that seat,
and I want that pension.

13:58.504 --> 14:00.120
Kate keeps on me
about retiring.

14:00.256 --> 14:01.918
This is
our little compromise.

14:03.051 --> 14:05.509
If I can get you that seat
and save the Monarch

14:05.636 --> 14:08.253
without killing another villain,
will you help us?

14:08.389 --> 14:09.470
Well...

14:09.599 --> 14:11.215
I very much like to kill.

14:11.351 --> 14:13.388
We get to break into
an O.S.I. Dummy Corp.

14:13.519 --> 14:15.181
And kill?

14:19.901 --> 14:21.358
You think he's finished yet?

14:21.486 --> 14:23.648
Give him
a couple more minutes.

14:25.740 --> 14:27.402
Y-You can sit
in the front, you know.

14:27.533 --> 14:28.899
I know.

14:30.328 --> 14:31.364
Tunes?

14:31.496 --> 14:34.534
Got my old iPod.
We could rock out.

14:34.665 --> 14:36.952
Let's not rock out.

14:37.835 --> 14:39.622
I've got some
sick playlists on there.

14:39.754 --> 14:40.994
You like trip hop with maybe...

14:41.089 --> 14:42.816
Yeah, why don't we go in
and check if he's done in there?

14:42.840 --> 14:44.547
Oh, yeah, he's...
I bet he's done.

14:47.470 --> 14:50.713
I was, uh, swapping out the
surveillance with yesterday's.

14:50.848 --> 14:52.635
Mm-hmm.

14:52.767 --> 14:54.554
I like sick playlists.

14:54.685 --> 14:56.893
And rocking out.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.437
Oh, hi.

15:03.569 --> 15:04.901
The room is secured.

15:05.029 --> 15:07.396
How long do we have
till they regain consciousness?

15:07.532 --> 15:08.648
Um...

15:08.783 --> 15:11.571
- Hey, hey, hey.
- I'm gonna vomit.

15:11.702 --> 15:12.863
Hey, come on.
Hey, wake up.

15:12.995 --> 15:14.657
You got to stop doing that.

15:14.789 --> 15:17.202
- You want to do Mad Libs?
- Do... Do what?

15:17.333 --> 15:18.744
You know Mad Libs,
the party game.

15:18.876 --> 15:21.243
- We're having a party.
- Are you serious?

15:21.379 --> 15:23.462
Verb ending in I-N-G?

15:23.589 --> 15:25.421
Stop.
P-Please stop.

15:25.550 --> 15:27.390
Come on, nobody ever wants
to do these with me.

15:27.468 --> 15:29.926
I'm putting down "stop,"
but with "I-N-G."

15:30.054 --> 15:32.171
"Stopping."

15:32.306 --> 15:34.923
Oh, you should
read this out loud.

15:35.059 --> 15:37.517
Why aren't those
in a database

15:37.645 --> 15:39.511
or like online or something?

15:39.647 --> 15:40.888
The O.S.I.'s old-school.

15:41.023 --> 15:43.561
Paranoid, superstitious.
You know the type.

15:43.693 --> 15:45.685
Aren't we all?
Look at this.

15:45.820 --> 15:48.608
I wear the same socks
every time I kill.

15:48.739 --> 15:51.527
I call them
Steve and Dave Kill Sock.

15:51.659 --> 15:52.900
This is Dave Kill Sock.

15:53.035 --> 15:55.072
I got that beat.
I can beat that.

15:55.204 --> 15:57.912
My dead friend's glove.

15:58.040 --> 16:00.748
And for a bonus creepy,
I used to smell it

16:00.877 --> 16:02.664
right before I did
something dangerous.

16:02.795 --> 16:05.162
You ever seen
one of these, kid?

16:05.298 --> 16:06.914
A ticket stub?
Yeah.

16:07.049 --> 16:09.169
What's that, from the first time
you got girly action?

16:09.302 --> 16:11.259
No, Gary,
that's a ticket stub

16:11.387 --> 16:14.596
from movie night
on Gargantua-1.

16:14.724 --> 16:15.724
Found it!

16:15.808 --> 16:17.925
Wait.
You were at movie night?

16:18.060 --> 16:21.349
The Guild, before your time,
tried to do a hostage thing.

16:21.481 --> 16:22.813
Jonas Venture.

16:22.940 --> 16:25.273
The big man
and his space station.

16:25.401 --> 16:28.144
Ah, the '80s.
We did that back then.

16:28.279 --> 16:31.738
Dumb kids gonna get famous.
Notorious.

16:31.866 --> 16:33.323
We dressed as crew members.

16:33.451 --> 16:35.818
Some of us had our space suits
on, some of us didn't.

16:35.953 --> 16:38.286
With this face,
the helmet never came off.

16:38.414 --> 16:41.407
Went perfectly.
Flawless.

16:41.542 --> 16:44.660
Well, until someone
opened the bay doors.

16:44.795 --> 16:45.795
No one knew who did it.

16:45.796 --> 16:47.037
The crew shot out

16:47.173 --> 16:48.973
like their mamas
were ringing the dinner bell.

16:49.091 --> 16:51.424
You ever see a man die
in space?

16:51.552 --> 16:53.384
You can tell the ones
that held their breath.

16:53.513 --> 16:56.927
Their lungs rupture
from all that gas expanding.

16:57.058 --> 16:59.345
Blood from their mouth
like a torn pillow

16:59.477 --> 17:01.184
stuffed with red BBs.

17:01.312 --> 17:02.848
Stab Girl,
she was a little thing,

17:02.980 --> 17:04.391
carried switchblades.

17:04.523 --> 17:05.810
She knew to exhale.

17:05.942 --> 17:07.854
Watched her
for a full minute.

17:07.984 --> 17:09.977
Puffed up like
she had a peanut allergy.

17:10.112 --> 17:11.898
Floating by me
with her mouth open,

17:12.031 --> 17:14.614
screaming, making no sound,

17:14.742 --> 17:17.405
spit on her tongue boiling.

17:17.537 --> 17:20.621
Anyway, got to see
a little "Sharky's Machine."

17:22.375 --> 17:24.492
All right, let's bounce!

17:24.627 --> 17:25.708
Get this man

17:25.836 --> 17:29.671
and meet us at Wide Wale's
penthouse at 2200 hours.

17:30.883 --> 17:32.243
You wait on the roof
for Red Death,

17:32.301 --> 17:33.712
then come in at my signal.

17:33.844 --> 17:35.405
Don't be late again!

17:35.429 --> 17:36.221
10-4.

17:36.222 --> 17:37.862
Don't use numbers
you heard on TV, just...

17:37.890 --> 17:40.553
No, yeah, that was...
I won't be late.

17:44.105 --> 17:45.687
They got pizza in there.

17:45.815 --> 17:47.681
Six bucks says
they don't save us a slice.

17:54.156 --> 17:57.024
Hey, uh,
Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS.

17:57.159 --> 17:58.900
- You need a hand?
- Maybe two?

17:59.036 --> 18:01.949
- No, I'm fine.
- Yeah, you are.

18:02.081 --> 18:04.619
No, no, no, no!
No, go back up!

18:04.750 --> 18:05.957
Go back up!

18:08.421 --> 18:10.788
Penthouse, <i>per favore.
Andiamo!</i>

18:10.923 --> 18:13.836
You know what I love about
sexist clowns like you guys?

18:13.968 --> 18:16.176
You actually think
you're nice guys.

18:16.304 --> 18:18.762
You're just being friendly.
You'd never hit a girl.

18:18.889 --> 18:20.630
I could do <i>this</i>

18:20.766 --> 18:21.882
and you wouldn't do
a thing.

18:22.018 --> 18:23.554
Hey, hey, listen, girly,
you don't...

18:25.855 --> 18:28.893
"Girly"? Really?
You were begging for that.

18:29.025 --> 18:31.938
Hank Venture
is behind me. Follow me.

18:32.069 --> 18:33.526
Hank Venture's behind me.

18:33.654 --> 18:35.065
Yeah,
almost makes up

18:35.197 --> 18:36.842
for him scuffing my knuckles
with his face.

18:42.288 --> 18:44.405
Plan B?

18:46.250 --> 18:48.242
Pretty poetic, huh?

18:48.377 --> 18:51.916
What, you dressed up the Venture
kid like a gigolo to kill me?

18:52.048 --> 18:54.756
I dressed-a myself
like a "juggalo," sir!

18:54.884 --> 18:57.922
Oh, super poetic.
Yeah, you're Lord Byron.

18:58.054 --> 18:59.340
He won't do it.

18:59.472 --> 19:01.088
Don't you listen to him,
Enrico.

19:01.223 --> 19:03.590
Just pull the trigger,
and you're family.

19:03.726 --> 19:05.012
You'll marry my daughter.

19:05.144 --> 19:07.932
You'll live in a frigging
magic petting zoo or some shit.

19:08.064 --> 19:09.726
W-Whatever.
Just kill him, son!

19:09.857 --> 19:12.520
Enrico!
Don't do it!

19:12.652 --> 19:13.984
V-Viceroy?

19:14.111 --> 19:15.977
Y-You're out of-a Dunwitch?

19:16.113 --> 19:18.981
That's my backup.
He's only 15 hours late.

19:19.116 --> 19:21.654
What are you doing?
This isn't Hank of you.

19:21.786 --> 19:25.325
Enrico Matassa is a lover,
not a fighter!

19:25.456 --> 19:26.947
You speak-a the truth.

19:27.083 --> 19:30.042
Your words are-a very Hank-a,
my friend.

19:30.169 --> 19:32.126
Just down that hall
is the woman you love!

19:32.254 --> 19:33.995
Give me the gun, Enrico.

19:34.131 --> 19:36.874
Does she crave Enrico?

19:37.009 --> 19:39.126
Want Enrico?
Burn for Enrico?!

19:39.261 --> 19:41.503
- Yearn for...
- Oh, stop already!

19:51.857 --> 19:53.143
Sorry about the drama.

19:53.275 --> 19:55.938
They don't have wheelchair
access in this building.

19:56.070 --> 19:59.484
Oh, oh!
That was terrifying.

19:59.615 --> 20:02.323
Dougie?
I-Is that you, Dougie?

20:02.451 --> 20:04.738
- Y-You're alive?
- Of course.

20:04.870 --> 20:09.490
I have so much starfish DNA
in me that I regenerate limbs.

20:09.625 --> 20:11.161
I grew my head back.

20:11.293 --> 20:12.409
You'd know this

20:12.545 --> 20:14.662
if you occasionally answered
Mom's e-mails.

20:14.797 --> 20:16.663
She... She sends those
little cat videos.

20:16.799 --> 20:19.507
Always with the excuses!

20:19.635 --> 20:21.922
I've been under
O.S.I. protection

20:22.054 --> 20:24.671
because you're a...
you're a villain!

20:24.807 --> 20:26.969
I live in fear of you,
Chester.

20:27.101 --> 20:29.058
Dougie,
it's your little brother.

20:29.186 --> 20:30.427
I-I would never hurt you.

20:30.563 --> 20:32.805
You're holding a gun,
Chester!

20:32.940 --> 20:35.683
The red-faced guy
with the horse told me

20:35.818 --> 20:36.934
you were gonna kill a guy?

20:37.069 --> 20:40.028
This? No, no, no!
This was just fun.

20:40.156 --> 20:43.069
Yeah!
Just playing cops and robbers.

20:43.200 --> 20:44.281
Every Tuesday!

20:44.410 --> 20:47.073
Hey, boss, look who I found
snooping around.

20:47.204 --> 20:49.196
Oh!
You win, Rocco!

20:49.331 --> 20:52.745
Now, uh, uh, you hide,
and, uh, we'll look for you.

20:52.877 --> 20:55.085
- Get outta here.
- What? Oh, yeah.

20:55.212 --> 20:57.329
Uh, y-you want I should
I hide behind this thing?

20:57.465 --> 20:59.047
Hi, baby.

20:59.175 --> 21:00.735
Maybe we should
leave them to talk, huh?

21:00.760 --> 21:02.922
Oh, I think <i>we</i> need to talk
as well.

21:03.053 --> 21:04.173
I just heard breaking glass.

21:04.305 --> 21:06.092
- What is going on?
- Shh! Sirena, hide!

21:06.223 --> 21:08.761
- What is Hank doing here?
- I-I don't remember.

21:08.893 --> 21:11.135
S-Sirena?

21:11.270 --> 21:13.978
I-It's me!
Your Uncle Douglas!

21:14.106 --> 21:15.517
Oh, my God, hi!

21:15.649 --> 21:17.231
I have an uncle?!

21:17.359 --> 21:18.691
Oh, Chester!

21:18.819 --> 21:20.481
I thought you was dead.

21:20.613 --> 21:22.070
This is
the greatest thing ever.

21:22.198 --> 21:24.941
You're not
out of the doghouse yet.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.153
Uh, here's something.

21:29.288 --> 21:30.950
The building across the street.

21:31.081 --> 21:32.913
Ven-Tech Tower?

21:33.042 --> 21:35.750
It looks like
it's trying to move.

22:06.867 --> 22:08.358
That's messed up.

22:08.494 --> 22:11.908
Dude!
That's the Morphomobile!

22:18.212 --> 22:21.000
The Blue Morpho?
How is that possible?

22:21.131 --> 22:25.045
Oh, who fucking cares?!
I'm out of the doghouse!

22:28.472 --> 22:29.758
A what?!

22:30.305 --> 22:36.659
