WEBVTT

00:44.617 --> 00:46.252
All clear.

00:46.686 --> 00:49.393
Mount pickets and keep a watch.

00:49.427 --> 00:53.267
Bring hemp, wrap the officers.

00:53.301 --> 00:55.139
Bury the rest...

00:55.173 --> 00:57.479
over there.

01:19.591 --> 01:22.331
That as Thou hast raised up
my body from fast and sound sleep,

01:22.365 --> 01:25.904
so also Thou would deliver
my mind from the sleep of sin.

01:28.173 --> 01:31.045
Did they change the prayers
for middle sleep?

01:32.384 --> 01:35.220
I'm praying for us.

01:35.254 --> 01:38.994
Before first sleep, second sleep,
morning, afternoon, and night again.

01:46.339 --> 01:48.542
Don't you see
that this plague is a sign?

01:48.577 --> 01:51.080
- Mary...
- God is sending you a message.

01:51.115 --> 01:53.451
Look, it's not a plague.

01:53.485 --> 01:55.789
It's maggots. They happen.

01:58.864 --> 02:02.268
Perhaps it's the Lord's grace.

02:02.302 --> 02:04.872
We can leave here and move in
with your father at Whitehall

02:04.906 --> 02:06.710
before winter comes.

02:11.653 --> 02:14.492
Come here. Come here.

02:14.526 --> 02:16.796
Look.

02:18.833 --> 02:20.202
You see that?

02:20.236 --> 02:23.040
We still have over half our crop

02:23.074 --> 02:25.413
stored safe in the shed.

02:25.448 --> 02:28.050
I'll haul it to the green
tomorrow and sell it.

02:29.553 --> 02:32.088
How much will that make?

02:32.123 --> 02:35.294
It'll be enough to make it
through the winter.

02:35.329 --> 02:38.296
Then what about spring? We'll have
nothing left to reseed the field.

02:38.331 --> 02:40.399
We're not moving in with my father.

02:56.809 --> 02:58.906
Did we wake you up, little man?

02:58.941 --> 03:01.675
Come here, come here.

03:01.709 --> 03:04.943
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

03:04.977 --> 03:06.707
Here, I'll show you something.

03:09.279 --> 03:12.432
What's in here? Huh?

03:14.149 --> 03:15.746
Oh.

03:17.881 --> 03:19.915
What's this?

03:21.115 --> 03:23.048
Ooh.

03:23.082 --> 03:24.782
Pirate treasure.

03:24.816 --> 03:26.950
Pirate treasure.

03:26.984 --> 03:30.435
Yeah, your pa's made arrangements.

03:31.653 --> 03:34.155
Our little secret,
though, eh, Sprout?

03:52.406 --> 03:54.604
Abraham!

04:02.077 --> 04:04.475
Luke! Jeremiah!

04:04.509 --> 04:06.077
Oh, mercy!

04:08.047 --> 04:09.281
Get back inside!

04:40.707 --> 04:43.405
<i>â™ª Hush, hush â™ª</i>

04:43.440 --> 04:45.807
<i>â™ª There's snakes in the garden â™ª</i>

04:45.841 --> 04:48.974
<i>â™ª Soul for sale â™ª</i>

04:49.008 --> 04:51.847
<i>â™ª Blood on the rise â™ª</i>

04:52.949 --> 04:55.116
<i>â™ª Hush, hush â™ª</i>

04:55.150 --> 04:59.585
<i>- â™ª I can't wait anymore â™ª
- â™ª Soul for sale â™ª</i>

05:01.223 --> 05:04.962
<i>â™ª I can't wait anymore â™ª</i>

05:07.229 --> 05:10.298
<i>â™ª Hush, hush â™ª</i>

05:16.656 --> 05:18.056
Did anyone else see them?

05:18.791 --> 05:20.056
No.

05:21.345 --> 05:23.010
They wore masks of Guy Fawkes

05:23.045 --> 05:25.348
like the ones the soldiers are
making for their bonfire night.

05:25.382 --> 05:27.650
Could've been soldiers,
could've been anybody.

05:27.684 --> 05:31.348
A royal officer gets his throat
slit and the killer walks free,

05:31.382 --> 05:33.684
and there are many in this town
believe you got away with murder

05:33.718 --> 05:35.387
because you are my son.

05:39.124 --> 05:41.759
Look.

05:41.794 --> 05:44.664
What is this?

05:44.698 --> 05:47.533
You accused me of lying
to you in your house

05:47.567 --> 05:49.769
and you were right.

05:52.074 --> 05:54.840
I wasn't robbed by rebels,
as I told the major.

05:56.008 --> 05:58.844
Instead, I cut my own scar,

05:58.878 --> 06:01.882
I buried the silver by the shore, and
I used the silk to sell my story.

06:01.916 --> 06:03.882
Now, I did all those things...

06:05.519 --> 06:08.524
but I did not kill Captain Joyce

06:08.558 --> 06:10.491
nor any other man in my life,

06:10.525 --> 06:13.360
and nor will I until God
meets me for judgment.

06:19.672 --> 06:22.136
This is the profit
from your smuggling?

06:22.170 --> 06:24.770
I undertook a risk

06:24.804 --> 06:27.836
to take care of my farm
and my family

06:27.870 --> 06:29.869
on my own terms...

06:35.005 --> 06:37.171
when I should have
accepted your offer to help.

06:50.240 --> 06:52.475
I knew in my heart
you didn't do this.

06:53.810 --> 06:56.743
That's why I kept
your name from my list.

06:57.644 --> 06:59.711
What list?

07:02.418 --> 07:04.916
Major Hewlett will have
justice for Captain Joyce.

07:04.951 --> 07:08.351
He requested I make a list of the most
likely and suspected individuals.

07:08.385 --> 07:10.186
Well, now that we know
that it's not me,

07:10.221 --> 07:11.787
maybe the next rogue on your list

07:11.820 --> 07:13.654
is the same bastard
who fired my farm.

07:13.688 --> 07:15.854
The next name on my list
is Anna Strong.

07:15.888 --> 07:16.940
Anna St...

07:17.015 --> 07:19.123
Before you protest,
acknowledge the facts.

07:19.158 --> 07:21.325
Following the brawl with Joyce,
her husband was imprisoned

07:21.360 --> 07:23.094
and her estate made vulnerable,

07:23.128 --> 07:25.263
and she's always been someone
who acted without thought.

07:25.297 --> 07:27.299
- Now may I protest?
- No.

07:28.667 --> 07:30.065
No.

07:45.171 --> 07:47.338
Bring in Guy Fawkes.

07:56.047 --> 07:57.846
Whoa.

08:40.772 --> 08:42.672
Here's to defeat.

08:42.706 --> 08:45.472
Everyone's speaking of the
ambush in Connecticut.

08:45.506 --> 08:47.839
Looks like your message got to Ben.

08:49.241 --> 08:50.874
Captain Joyce.

08:50.908 --> 08:53.341
He was quartered
in your home, was he not?

08:53.376 --> 08:55.141
Joyce, aye.

08:55.175 --> 08:57.742
In the room Captain Simcoe took.

08:57.777 --> 09:00.378
Won't have to worry about
either of them now, do we?

09:01.813 --> 09:03.982
You may have to worry about Joyce.

09:06.652 --> 09:09.450
My father believes that you killed him.

09:09.484 --> 09:11.754
And he plans to say so to Hewlett.

09:25.068 --> 09:27.437
I need to look through
the captain's belongings,

09:27.472 --> 09:31.541
try and find something that
can tell me about the man.

09:31.576 --> 09:33.076
What?

09:33.110 --> 09:35.379
I don't know exactly.

09:35.414 --> 09:37.483
I mean, he obviously kept secrets.

09:37.518 --> 09:38.917
Why else would he walk
to Lewis Field

09:38.951 --> 09:40.871
in the middle of the night
to get his throat cut?

09:48.620 --> 09:51.718
His trunk is in my home.
I'll look through it.

09:51.753 --> 09:54.052
For now, let's celebrate.

09:54.087 --> 09:58.423
Captain Simcoe's gone to
heaven and we did that.

10:06.790 --> 10:08.490
More rum, please.

10:10.024 --> 10:12.859
Can't get the ball out.
At least with my knife.

10:12.893 --> 10:15.358
Then let's toast to that.

10:15.392 --> 10:17.924
He's awake now, ready to talk.

10:17.958 --> 10:19.926
He's ready to die, yeah?

10:20.127 --> 10:22.927
__

10:25.264 --> 10:28.699
Hey, you didn't promise Abe this
lobster would vanish, all right?

10:28.734 --> 10:30.201
I did.

10:30.236 --> 10:33.239
Look, there is a greater
obligation here.

10:33.274 --> 10:36.374
Someone has been whispering
into the enemy's ear,

10:36.408 --> 10:38.968
and the only ones that knew about
the location of that safe house

10:38.977 --> 10:41.045
were ranked well above me.

10:41.079 --> 10:44.047
Yeah, and him.

10:44.081 --> 10:48.353
You truly think that Captain Simcoe,
last week Lieutenant,

10:48.388 --> 10:52.224
is gonna know the name of a
turncoat in our buff and blues?

10:52.258 --> 10:53.625
Huh?

10:53.659 --> 10:55.693
He's low on the chain, Ben.

10:55.728 --> 10:58.396
Yeah, he may know enough.

11:00.399 --> 11:03.530
We'll have a surgeon
attend to his leg at camp.

11:04.832 --> 11:06.499
I'd like a word with the captain now.

11:06.534 --> 11:08.667
A word?

11:08.701 --> 11:11.568
Do you suppose pain
will rob me of reason?

11:11.602 --> 11:13.302
Oh, I should hope not.

11:13.336 --> 11:15.236
You should not hope.

11:15.271 --> 11:18.607
It wastes your time and my rum,
of which there is little left.

11:18.641 --> 11:20.049
I'm afraid I...

11:20.087 --> 11:21.999
Even given the tragic state
of the Continental Army,

11:22.034 --> 11:23.909
this is no way
to detain a fellow officer,

11:23.943 --> 11:27.477
which is how I know
that after our "word,"

11:27.511 --> 11:29.743
you mean to extinguish me.

11:29.778 --> 11:32.344
You may as well do so now.

11:32.379 --> 11:35.447
This rum tastes like piss.

11:41.452 --> 11:48.922
__

12:39.492 --> 12:41.491
Think they'll stop him in time?

12:42.892 --> 12:45.228
It'll be more interesting
if they don't.

12:47.698 --> 12:50.632
What's the name of the dead
man that told you I was here?

12:50.667 --> 12:52.969
Funny you should ask.

12:56.440 --> 13:01.511
I believe you misplaced one of those
to an intrepid young dragoon.

13:01.546 --> 13:04.145
Where?

13:04.180 --> 13:07.217
I told you, a rebel safe
house in Connecticut.

13:07.251 --> 13:09.984
After you turned me down,
I turned to another,

13:10.018 --> 13:13.518
a warden of some backwater in
Long Island who sent 20 men.

13:13.552 --> 13:17.992
Apparently not the right men.

13:18.027 --> 13:21.360
That bonnet was found
with their corpses.

13:28.269 --> 13:31.870
Perhaps your precious
source in New Jersey

13:31.905 --> 13:33.903
is having a laugh.

13:33.937 --> 13:36.738
Sounds like your ambush
was ambushed.

13:36.772 --> 13:38.973
I intend to...

13:40.009 --> 13:43.712
reexamine New Jersey.

13:43.746 --> 13:46.015
I thought you might be interested
in a trip to Connecticut,

13:46.050 --> 13:49.719
seeing as the bonnet
doth bellow for revenge.

13:51.122 --> 13:53.957
What's the name of the backwater?

13:57.228 --> 14:01.099
Oh, some little fish town you've
probably never heard of called Setauket.

15:04.490 --> 15:06.025
"My dearest captain,"

15:06.060 --> 15:08.895
when last we were together
under the stars,

15:08.929 --> 15:12.292
I felt you were holding back your
true feelings and most tender words.

15:12.326 --> 15:15.257
There is so much I wish
for myself to say,

15:15.292 --> 15:17.993
but I thought better
to wait until you spoke first.

15:18.028 --> 15:19.529
Please forgive my forward nature,

15:19.563 --> 15:21.932
but I must make
my feelings known to you.

15:21.967 --> 15:24.502
It is my great happiness that
this war would bring us together

15:24.537 --> 15:26.437
and my great agony
that I cannot spend

15:26.472 --> 15:28.872
"each day and every night
in your embrace."

15:28.907 --> 15:30.473
And so on like this for a while.

15:30.507 --> 15:33.074
But let me get to the telling part.

15:33.109 --> 15:37.509
She writes, she cannot wait for
Joyce to sound retreat here.

15:37.543 --> 15:39.344
"For even though it be end of day,

15:39.378 --> 15:42.016
mine ears hear reveille
in the rising sun."

15:43.352 --> 15:44.952
"Sound retreat."

15:45.888 --> 15:47.456
"Sound retreat."

15:47.491 --> 15:49.058
That'll be their signal.

15:49.092 --> 15:51.392
Like the petticoat
I hanged for Caleb.

15:51.426 --> 15:53.725
Yeah, it's clever 'cause Captain Joyce
could have the regiment's drummer

15:53.759 --> 15:56.060
sound any alarm he wished to test
readiness, so sound retreat...

15:56.094 --> 15:59.297
And, at the same time, signal to
meet under the tree at Lewis Field.

15:59.331 --> 16:01.067
Exactly.

16:04.071 --> 16:08.074
Why do you suppose that trysts
are always held under a tree?

16:09.777 --> 16:11.546
It was good enough
for Adam and Eve.

16:11.581 --> 16:14.414
It was good enough for us.

16:37.344 --> 16:39.646
Tell me, Philomena,

16:39.680 --> 16:41.613
how did you come to be a player?

16:41.647 --> 16:43.979
I admire you.

16:44.013 --> 16:45.813
What skill.

16:45.847 --> 16:49.148
Oh, I merely pretend
at the heroics, sir.

16:49.183 --> 16:51.318
You live them out.

16:51.352 --> 16:53.152
Now I can say to my friends

16:53.187 --> 16:54.752
that I was paid a compliment

16:54.787 --> 16:57.457
by Major John Andre
of the King's Army.

16:57.491 --> 17:02.364
Tell me, how many men
are under your command?

17:03.898 --> 17:07.335
In a way, the whole theater
of war falls under my concern.

17:09.141 --> 17:10.907
I'm special adjutant

17:10.943 --> 17:14.012
in charge of gathering
intelligence, you see.

17:14.046 --> 17:15.714
Oh?

17:17.183 --> 17:19.550
I divine what the enemy
plans to do before they do it.

17:19.585 --> 17:22.320
General Howe applies his
military strategy on the field

17:22.355 --> 17:24.390
with the discipline
and precision of a science,

17:24.424 --> 17:26.358
but what I do...

17:27.926 --> 17:30.561
is closer to an art.

17:30.596 --> 17:32.931
Mm.

17:42.245 --> 17:44.410
Now, if the prospect of a lone woman

17:44.444 --> 17:47.212
overpowering a royal
officer is too much,

17:47.246 --> 17:49.981
I submit Mrs. Strong
could've hired a cutthroat

17:50.015 --> 17:52.114
from some nearby port
to do the deed.

17:52.148 --> 17:55.185
The matter of Captain Joyce's
death will be addressed,

17:55.219 --> 17:58.020
but my priority now
is to secure this garrison.

17:58.055 --> 18:01.424
This loss has made us
vulnerable to attack.

18:01.458 --> 18:03.561
- Sir?
- Yes?

18:03.596 --> 18:06.095
A Major Robert Rogers from
New York to see you, sir.

18:06.130 --> 18:07.797
Major?

18:09.300 --> 18:11.865
That's a letter of introduction

18:11.899 --> 18:14.400
from your friend, John Andre.

18:14.435 --> 18:18.400
Ah, well, the famed Robert Rogers
needs no introduction.

18:18.434 --> 18:20.102
Welcome to Setauket, sir.

18:20.136 --> 18:23.039
This man here is our local
magistrate, Richard Woodhull.

18:23.073 --> 18:26.341
- Major, it's an honor.
- Thank you, Richard.

18:30.936 --> 18:32.656
Now, you must be tired
after your journey.

18:32.680 --> 18:33.981
Perhaps you would just like to rest

18:34.015 --> 18:36.283
or have a proper discussion
over dinner.

18:36.317 --> 18:38.085
Here about the business
in Connecticut.

18:38.119 --> 18:41.391
I should like to question your
officers who ran the raid.

18:42.326 --> 18:44.059
They are dead, sir.

18:44.093 --> 18:46.861
Not all of them.

18:46.896 --> 18:49.699
Captain Simcoe is still missing.

18:49.733 --> 18:52.501
Then I should very much
like to question him.

18:57.174 --> 19:01.343
It says there that you're
to give me what I require

19:01.377 --> 19:05.882
so that I may find the
chalker who left me that.

19:07.081 --> 19:09.417
Yes, I did wonder why

19:09.451 --> 19:12.087
a cap of the Queen's Rangers
was found at the ambush.

19:12.122 --> 19:13.755
It was left for me

19:13.789 --> 19:16.925
by a young cavalryman

19:16.960 --> 19:19.061
who felled one of my men.

19:19.095 --> 19:21.361
And 19 of mine.

19:21.395 --> 19:23.496
All by himself?

19:23.530 --> 19:25.566
Obviously not.

19:25.601 --> 19:29.169
How many of them was there, then?

19:29.203 --> 19:31.836
Ah, you don't know

19:31.870 --> 19:34.405
'cause you didn't count the tracks,

19:34.440 --> 19:37.208
and you buried the bodies

19:37.242 --> 19:39.676
that could tell us the tale,

19:39.711 --> 19:42.679
except for them highborn lads

19:42.714 --> 19:45.215
who paid for passage
back to London Town.

19:45.249 --> 19:49.552
Upon reflection, I do not believe
I shall be able to host dinner tonight.

19:49.586 --> 19:51.320
Please accept my apology.

19:51.354 --> 19:55.424
You fancy that I wish to spend
one more hour than necessary

19:55.458 --> 19:57.759
in this clammy province?

19:57.794 --> 20:00.995
I should like

20:01.029 --> 20:03.964
to question your officers.

20:07.805 --> 20:10.172
Here they are.

20:10.206 --> 20:11.972
All pickled in rum.

20:12.007 --> 20:14.776
- The barrels are sealed.
- Not for long.

20:16.646 --> 20:18.748
You said only three were recovered.

20:18.782 --> 20:21.250
Who's the fourth?

20:21.284 --> 20:23.485
That would be Captain Joyce.

20:24.921 --> 20:27.255
Who in the hell's Captain Joyce?

20:27.289 --> 20:30.825
He was a troubled officer.

20:30.859 --> 20:33.999
He was found murdered
in a field here last week.

20:35.568 --> 20:37.769
I'm examining
the situation very closely.

20:37.803 --> 20:41.376
His death is not connected to theirs
and should be no concern of yours.

20:41.411 --> 20:43.211
Oh.

20:43.246 --> 20:46.547
So you think it bad luck, then,
his murder so close to theirs.

20:46.582 --> 20:49.584
- I think a coincidence, yes.
- "Coincidence"?

20:51.218 --> 20:54.189
I've seen all manner of
strange things in this life,

20:54.223 --> 20:56.291
but never one of those.

20:56.326 --> 21:01.026
Now, why don't you tell me all
about troubled Captain Joyce?

21:16.772 --> 21:19.101
Thank you, Captain Tallmadge.

21:21.984 --> 21:23.751
Tallmadge?

21:23.785 --> 21:26.620
That's one of the family
names where I'm stationed.

21:26.654 --> 21:29.258
You must hail from Setauket,

21:29.292 --> 21:30.891
like your man here, mister, um...

21:30.926 --> 21:34.062
Caleb Brewster, Your Grace.

21:36.766 --> 21:39.466
I do apologize for my
ill manners before.

21:39.500 --> 21:42.071
It was my leg talking.

21:42.106 --> 21:45.009
Again, the apology is all mine.

21:45.043 --> 21:47.744
You had every right
to doubt my intentions.

21:47.778 --> 21:50.713
Now, then...

21:50.748 --> 21:52.582
to business.

21:52.616 --> 21:54.284
What is it you wish to know?

21:54.318 --> 21:57.889
Oh, nothing, sir. We already
know all we need to.

21:57.924 --> 21:59.692
Truly?

21:59.726 --> 22:01.825
You know where we mean to
strike after retaking New York?

22:01.859 --> 22:04.628
We know you have 4,000 men

22:04.662 --> 22:06.431
stationed at Throgs Neck
in Brooklyn

22:06.466 --> 22:08.169
as part of your occupation force.

22:08.203 --> 22:10.171
4,000?

22:10.205 --> 22:12.973
Try six.

22:16.880 --> 22:19.315
Well, it doesn't
really matter how many.

22:19.349 --> 22:21.452
You'll never catch Washington anyway.

22:21.486 --> 22:23.989
Ah, yes, the old fox.

22:24.024 --> 22:26.458
Well, it's not my duty to bag him.

22:26.493 --> 22:28.160
I leave that to the brothers Howe.

22:28.194 --> 22:30.897
Oh, of course, though
I suppose General Howe

22:30.931 --> 22:33.533
might be slowed a bit
by the ash pile in the city.

22:33.568 --> 22:36.069
Ashes dissolve in the sea.

22:37.038 --> 22:40.475
Our navy is not only the mightiest
on Earth, it is the fastest.

22:41.677 --> 22:43.613
But where will it sail?

22:44.883 --> 22:48.250
Well, I suppose it doesn't matter
because you already know.

22:52.617 --> 22:54.251
I'm sorry.

22:55.587 --> 22:58.155
"Mock not nor jest
at another man's misfortune

22:58.190 --> 23:00.621
though there seem to be some cause."

23:02.621 --> 23:04.623
No, Caleb, Caleb, Caleb!

23:06.929 --> 23:08.263
It's my turn now.

23:44.353 --> 23:48.656
Hey, hey, how much wood
would a Woodhull haul

23:48.690 --> 23:50.592
if a Woodhull could haul wood?

23:51.961 --> 23:53.797
It's good to see you came down.

23:53.831 --> 23:55.534
Thought you might not.

23:55.568 --> 23:58.969
- Yeah?
- Well, we all heard about your accident.

23:59.003 --> 24:01.540
Oh, right.

24:01.574 --> 24:03.843
That was no accident.

24:03.877 --> 24:07.013
No, I just cooked up the rest of the
cabbage that my maggots didn't want.

24:08.750 --> 24:11.118
Well, you're loyal to your friends.

24:17.225 --> 24:19.524
Glad to see you here.

24:19.559 --> 24:21.991
Are you surprised as well?

24:25.697 --> 24:29.933
Judge Woodhull, is this your son
I've heard so much about?

24:29.968 --> 24:32.367
Major Rogers, I don't
believe I mentioned my son.

24:32.401 --> 24:35.201
You didn't. Robert
Rogers, Queen's Rangers.

24:35.235 --> 24:36.803
Abraham Woodhull.

24:36.837 --> 24:39.940
Why don't you fine gentlemen
let me buy you a round

24:39.975 --> 24:44.805
and we shall drink to friends
and traitors alike tonight, eh?

24:47.173 --> 24:50.276
To the enemies of our country,

24:50.310 --> 24:55.115
may they have cobweb breeches,

24:55.149 --> 24:58.283
a porcupine saddle,

24:58.317 --> 25:01.555
a hard-trotting horse,

25:01.590 --> 25:04.194
and an eternal journey.

25:10.503 --> 25:14.775
So, then, what brings a legend of
the frontier here to Long Island?

25:14.809 --> 25:17.043
Ah, the Rangers go where needed.

25:17.078 --> 25:20.582
Our quarry be those most
dangerous to His Majesty's rule.

25:20.616 --> 25:22.618
General Washington?

25:22.652 --> 25:25.622
Ooh, we'll get him.

25:25.657 --> 25:28.393
But I am now after a man

25:28.427 --> 25:31.231
more deviant and difficult to track.

25:31.266 --> 25:33.499
Hides not behind an army,

25:33.533 --> 25:36.437
but a thicket of lies and deception.

25:36.471 --> 25:38.604
So you've come here
looking for a single man?

25:38.638 --> 25:40.838
Perhaps.

25:40.872 --> 25:42.972
Though like all good plots,

25:43.007 --> 25:45.711
there's usually more than one involved.

25:45.745 --> 25:49.113
Ask your warm friend,
Guy Fawkes out there.

25:49.147 --> 25:51.949
Though usually it's only one
man who takes the credit

25:51.983 --> 25:54.050
and the infamy.

25:54.085 --> 25:56.120
Or immortality.

26:01.460 --> 26:05.394
Oh, beautiful. 1605.

26:05.428 --> 26:08.362
In commemoration
of the 5th of November act,

26:08.397 --> 26:11.668
Parliament issued, Amsterdam struck.

26:11.703 --> 26:15.570
Passed to me for my services
in the Seven Years' War.

26:18.475 --> 26:20.410
- Mm.
- Huh?

26:25.012 --> 26:28.984
"He who concealed himself
is detected."

26:39.226 --> 26:41.760
Madam, will you drink with us?

26:41.795 --> 26:43.861
- Actually, I have to...
- Oh, no, no.

26:43.895 --> 26:46.197
Please sit.

26:51.340 --> 26:53.540
I was just telling
these good gentlemen

26:53.575 --> 26:56.810
what a fine, uncommon
town you have here.

26:56.844 --> 26:58.246
Uncommon?

26:58.281 --> 27:00.517
Well, for such a tiny hamlet,

27:00.551 --> 27:04.184
there's an unusual amount of
smuggling, arson, and murder.

27:04.219 --> 27:07.587
You're speaking now
of Captain Joyce.

27:07.622 --> 27:10.390
Aye, he's part of a riddle
I'm trying to solve.

27:13.325 --> 27:16.060
A captain lay dead in a field.

27:16.096 --> 27:20.064
One week later,
20 of his men lay dead

27:20.098 --> 27:23.636
in Connecticut
with no enemy casualties

27:23.670 --> 27:25.169
to save their honor.

27:25.204 --> 27:28.004
How did this occur?

27:28.038 --> 27:30.843
I suppose the answer to that
lies in Connecticut.

27:30.877 --> 27:33.645
The old fella brought me here.

27:33.679 --> 27:36.279
- What old fellow?
- Him.

27:36.313 --> 27:40.682
Tells me there's something
corrupt in this town.

27:40.717 --> 27:44.052
- Something concealed.
- I agree.

27:47.421 --> 27:49.389
As you must have heard,
I was suspected

27:49.423 --> 27:51.659
of the captain's murder for a time.

27:51.693 --> 27:55.026
Although I was cleared
of all suspicion,

27:55.061 --> 27:59.166
the accusation
still vexed me greatly.

27:59.200 --> 28:02.469
So I took it upon myself to look into the
riddle of the man's death on my own.

28:02.503 --> 28:05.072
- You what?
- You've also likely heard

28:05.107 --> 28:08.409
that the captain
was billeted with Mrs. Strong.

28:09.877 --> 28:11.376
And while she was cleaning his room,

28:11.411 --> 28:14.145
she discovered a hidden
letter addressed to Joyce.

28:14.179 --> 28:17.617
Mrs. Strong, the letter?

28:19.552 --> 28:21.186
The letter?

28:27.894 --> 28:30.594
It is unsigned, but it seems to be

28:30.628 --> 28:34.034
from a secret lover here in Setauket.

28:38.971 --> 28:41.877
When did you find
this letter, Mrs. Strong?

28:41.911 --> 28:44.412
This morning, sir.

28:44.446 --> 28:46.583
And why did you
go to Mr. Woodhull?

28:46.617 --> 28:49.053
Why not straight to Hewlett?

28:49.887 --> 28:52.118
I...

28:52.152 --> 28:54.954
I thought...

28:54.988 --> 28:56.389
I thought, well...

28:56.423 --> 28:58.657
That's all right.

28:58.691 --> 29:01.123
I was in love once myself.

29:01.157 --> 29:03.658
Unfortunately married at the time, eh?

29:03.693 --> 29:07.294
Then you agree with me.
That if Joyce was done in,

29:07.328 --> 29:10.665
it was by the husband
of the letter writer.

29:18.774 --> 29:21.640
Let's ask Captain Joyce.

29:24.209 --> 29:26.412
All right, let's get him out.

29:30.313 --> 29:34.219
So, here is the gash

29:34.253 --> 29:36.522
that did him in, across the gullet.

29:36.556 --> 29:40.826
But here is another second stab,

29:40.860 --> 29:44.264
more like a first,
done with a short blade.

29:44.298 --> 29:46.602
Means he turned his back
on his killer.

29:46.637 --> 29:48.671
Means he trusted him.

29:48.705 --> 29:51.906
That's why I thought
Captain Simcoe first, eh?

29:53.076 --> 29:54.743
You think that...

29:54.778 --> 29:56.479
you think that
Captain Simcoe did this?

29:56.513 --> 29:59.382
The only officer
not found at the ambush,

29:59.417 --> 30:02.485
and a man who inherited
the captain's captaincy.

30:02.519 --> 30:04.789
I thought him the serpent I seek

30:04.824 --> 30:05.958
until I read your letter.

30:05.993 --> 30:07.893
Then I knew it could be a woman

30:07.927 --> 30:12.295
done with a paring knife
or a letter opener.

30:12.330 --> 30:15.501
And most likely we were just with her
and have given her fair warning.

30:15.536 --> 30:17.368
Now... now, wait.
You didn't read the letter.

30:17.403 --> 30:18.869
The letter she gave you.

30:18.903 --> 30:21.003
She found it.
It mentions a signal by drum.

30:21.037 --> 30:22.906
- Sound retreat.
- Yes, exactly.

30:22.940 --> 30:24.809
And there are four
other women by my count...

30:24.843 --> 30:26.344
- Your count? What count?
- Gentlemen...

30:26.378 --> 30:28.143
By my count of those
who work and live

30:28.178 --> 30:29.879
close enough
to hear the company drum.

30:29.913 --> 30:32.818
Good, good.
So there's four of them.

30:32.852 --> 30:34.854
Now, which of those four

30:34.889 --> 30:37.855
would Joyce likely dip his wick into?

30:37.889 --> 30:39.922
Well, there's...

30:39.956 --> 30:41.757
Hannah Ketcham, who's 74.

30:41.791 --> 30:46.295
Or Loretta Brewster,
who's plagued by palsy,

30:46.329 --> 30:48.061
and that leaves only...

30:48.096 --> 30:50.764
Maarten Dejong's wife, Klara...

30:50.798 --> 30:52.599
And Anna Strong.

30:54.767 --> 30:57.101
So there's two.

30:57.136 --> 31:00.341
I think I have a way to settle this.

31:11.970 --> 31:14.660
But it makes no sense to
sound retreat at this hour.

31:14.693 --> 31:17.895
The men will be confused,
but the culprit will be alarmed.

31:17.929 --> 31:20.197
- That's what I want.
- Well, I won't allow it.

31:20.232 --> 31:23.533
Captain Joyce had you
play roll call on some days,

31:23.568 --> 31:25.335
sound retreat on others.

31:25.370 --> 31:28.371
Captain Joyce was the finest
officer I ever served with.

31:28.405 --> 31:31.845
But he made you play drums
at odd hours.

31:31.880 --> 31:34.783
To keep the men on their toes, he'd say.
There was nothing improper.

31:34.817 --> 31:36.753
Thank you, Clayton.
This is foolish.

31:36.787 --> 31:39.023
And after it's done,
so is my work here.

31:39.058 --> 31:40.860
You have my word.

31:45.803 --> 31:47.538
Play.

31:47.573 --> 31:50.709
Which one is Klara?

31:50.743 --> 31:53.512
That one holding the lantern.

32:16.577 --> 32:18.278
Well, it's not Klara.

32:18.312 --> 32:22.050
Major, I wish you well on
your travel back to New York.

32:35.594 --> 32:37.360
You sure you can afford that?

32:37.395 --> 32:40.265
I know it was you.

32:42.335 --> 32:44.569
Meet me where you
killed Joyce, midnight.

32:44.604 --> 32:46.738
We can discuss
where to go from there.

33:12.764 --> 33:15.469
That's far enough.

33:15.503 --> 33:17.772
What do you want, Woodhull?
Money?

33:17.806 --> 33:19.640
I've not enough to cover your blight.

33:19.674 --> 33:21.474
All I want is for you to admit

33:21.509 --> 33:23.945
that you killed Captain Joyce
last Monday right here.

33:27.546 --> 33:30.480
I thought you were gonna
say you had some proof.

33:30.514 --> 33:33.551
If I prove that this is
your handwriting...

33:35.520 --> 33:38.286
you'll be put to death for
buggery, never mind murder.

33:39.755 --> 33:42.155
Where did you get that?

33:42.190 --> 33:45.121
He kept it hidden.

33:45.156 --> 33:49.160
He protected you, John,
and you killed him.

33:49.195 --> 33:51.762
No, you killed him.

33:51.796 --> 33:55.400
You... you and Selah Strong.

33:58.139 --> 34:02.141
See, it was just like that.

34:03.209 --> 34:05.809
I never even knew I drew it.

34:08.114 --> 34:11.484
Then Selah started
the fight in the tavern.

34:11.518 --> 34:14.186
The fight that they
blamed Charles for,

34:14.221 --> 34:17.359
that he blamed me for.

34:17.393 --> 34:20.694
It was the last night
we were ever to meet.

34:23.195 --> 34:27.701
And I knew his words,
I knew his words.

34:27.735 --> 34:30.937
What he said, he didn't mean it.

34:30.971 --> 34:33.040
And when he turned, I just...

34:36.145 --> 34:38.148
I didn't mean to.

34:38.183 --> 34:40.516
Is that what happened?

34:44.454 --> 34:46.290
You don't know what happened.

34:46.324 --> 34:50.157
Yeah, you were just supposed
to be a scapegoat, is all.

34:50.190 --> 34:53.125
- That's all you are.
- And so you burned my crop

34:53.159 --> 34:55.159
to keep the people thinking
that the town hated me.

34:55.164 --> 34:57.567
That's why I wanted to burn it, yeah.

34:57.601 --> 35:00.534
He actually thinks you did the deed.

35:00.568 --> 35:03.170
What?

35:03.205 --> 35:05.442
Who's he?

35:07.211 --> 35:08.842
A loyal drummer.

35:08.877 --> 35:11.076
I told him,
"Woodhull got away with it."

35:11.111 --> 35:13.446
Woodhull's father's got him free.

35:13.480 --> 35:15.248
"Woodhull's laughing about it."

35:15.282 --> 35:17.616
Woodhull! He just confessed to it!

35:17.650 --> 35:19.350
Crash that cull!

35:19.385 --> 35:21.186
- Crash it!
- Wait, stop!

35:21.220 --> 35:22.690
Hang on a second!

35:27.362 --> 35:30.730
You didn't tell me there'd be two.

35:30.764 --> 35:33.466
I-I-I didn't know.
I didn't know.

35:33.500 --> 35:35.768
P-please.
Please, sir, have mercy.

35:35.802 --> 35:38.170
Shut your hole.

35:38.204 --> 35:41.473
- Shouldn't we...
- Shh, something ain't right.

35:46.607 --> 35:48.407
Don't look so pale, Molly.

35:48.441 --> 35:50.541
We just caught Captain Joyce's killer.

35:52.778 --> 35:54.408
What?

35:54.522 --> 35:57.360
Must've resented playing it
all odd hours.

35:57.395 --> 36:00.847
Wait, you just... you just
heard this man confess.

36:02.483 --> 36:06.250
I heard all sorts
of strange tales today.

36:06.284 --> 36:09.316
Sounds that fade away...

36:09.351 --> 36:12.053
tracks that lead nowhere.

36:12.087 --> 36:15.091
And a smell.

36:15.125 --> 36:17.859
Oh, there's something
rotten in Setauket,

36:17.893 --> 36:20.328
but it ain't you.

36:22.065 --> 36:25.035
Oh, you're an aberration,

36:25.070 --> 36:28.473
one that could be of use
now that we know your shame.

36:28.507 --> 36:30.373
I'll do anything.

36:30.408 --> 36:34.612
I know. You'll keep your
eyes open and your trap shut

36:34.646 --> 36:36.648
and you'll look and you'll listen

36:36.683 --> 36:40.352
and you will sniff out the rot
in this place while I'm away.

36:40.387 --> 36:43.955
See?
I'm gonna keep you alive, Robeson,

36:43.989 --> 36:46.793
as the lowest form of life there is.

36:46.827 --> 36:50.831
Lower than a sodomite
or a serpent's belly.

36:50.865 --> 36:53.067
A spy.

36:54.670 --> 36:57.174
My spy...

36:57.208 --> 36:59.009
reporting only to me.

36:59.043 --> 37:02.545
No Hewlett, no regulars.

37:03.682 --> 37:07.483
Now, if you attempt to flee,

37:07.518 --> 37:11.153
Mr. Woodhull here will notify me

37:11.188 --> 37:13.420
- and I will find you.
- No, Major.

37:13.454 --> 37:16.490
- Mr. Woodhull.
- Listen, wait.

37:19.358 --> 37:21.392
I want your word as a gentleman

37:21.426 --> 37:23.261
you'll keep our little secret

37:23.295 --> 37:25.530
until we put Washington's
head in a noose.

37:25.564 --> 37:28.661
And then we'll put that
little bugger's head in one.

37:28.695 --> 37:32.699
I know it's detestable business,
looking after a spy,

37:32.734 --> 37:35.504
but it is a task that you

37:35.538 --> 37:38.738
shall have to endure for the king.

37:38.773 --> 37:40.842
Aye?

37:52.492 --> 37:54.693
Come to! Come to!

37:54.728 --> 37:56.195
I'm not done with you.

37:57.630 --> 37:59.031
Now, you can make this stop.

37:59.065 --> 38:01.900
But I hope you don't.

38:04.036 --> 38:08.174
It must be its own torture
to live like you do.

38:08.209 --> 38:10.546
On the run.

38:10.581 --> 38:15.218
So close to your home,
and yet not able to set foot in it.

38:17.087 --> 38:19.923
Except it isn't your town, is it?

38:19.958 --> 38:24.296
It belongs to our king. By rights.

38:24.331 --> 38:29.400
It's the arrogance of the colonies
that you forget this.

38:29.434 --> 38:32.837
That's why I joined the Royal Army.

38:32.872 --> 38:35.441
To remind you...

38:35.476 --> 38:39.211
in Guiana, the Caribbean...

38:39.246 --> 38:42.013
...and now New York.

38:43.517 --> 38:48.088
I've enjoyed reminding you
all over the world.

38:49.525 --> 38:51.160
I think we're done here, Ben.

38:51.194 --> 38:53.595
No.

38:53.629 --> 38:55.296
I'll do it.

38:55.330 --> 38:58.163
- General, sir.
- Move!

39:07.607 --> 39:10.045
My God, it's true.

39:12.413 --> 39:14.513
- Let him down.
- Please, sir, allow me to explain.

39:14.547 --> 39:18.318
I've come straight from Fort Lee
upon hearing a disturbing report.

39:18.354 --> 39:20.389
I will be returning
there straight away.

39:20.423 --> 39:23.761
You will return with me
to face disciplinary charges

39:23.795 --> 39:26.834
and most likely court-martial.

39:26.868 --> 39:28.934
- Sir, please, I can explain...
- Enough!

39:32.468 --> 39:35.171
You shouldn't have used
your own dragoons.

39:38.274 --> 39:40.107
Sir.

39:40.141 --> 39:42.442
I apologize for the
treatment you have received

39:42.476 --> 39:44.944
at the hands of a captain
under my command.

39:44.979 --> 39:47.447
You should know that
we treat fellow officers

39:47.482 --> 39:49.416
with respect,
whether captive or not.

39:49.450 --> 39:52.252
You can expect the proper
courtesy to be afforded to you

39:52.286 --> 39:53.686
from this moment forward.

39:53.721 --> 39:56.055
Thank you, General.

39:56.089 --> 40:00.891
Please don't go too hard
on Captain Tallmadge.

40:00.926 --> 40:04.565
He's been a perfect gentleman.

40:09.405 --> 40:10.938
I wish you could stay.

40:10.973 --> 40:13.207
Moi aussi.

40:13.242 --> 40:16.774
Can you at least tell me where your
next secret mission will take you

40:16.809 --> 40:19.242
so I can dream of you there?

40:19.277 --> 40:23.013
I've just completed my mission...

40:23.047 --> 40:26.016
the recruitment
of a young, talented agent

40:26.051 --> 40:29.853
willing to apply said talents
in service to the crown...

40:31.021 --> 40:35.188
for the aim
of ending this reckless war.

40:37.160 --> 40:39.730
Tell me...

40:39.764 --> 40:42.297
have you ever been to New Jersey?

40:48.675 --> 40:50.910
I saw your signal to meet.

40:50.945 --> 40:52.845
What is happening around here?

40:52.879 --> 40:54.946
First, your father
and Major Rogers tell me

40:54.980 --> 40:56.747
I'm to report to the church
in the morning,

40:56.781 --> 40:59.315
and then I go, and Rogers and his
Indian are riding out of town.

40:59.349 --> 41:01.149
Well, he won't be back.
Not for a while.

41:01.183 --> 41:02.715
And now there's a rumor around

41:02.750 --> 41:04.618
that the company drummer
killed Captain Joyce.

41:04.652 --> 41:07.055
- How does that make sense?
- It doesn't.

41:07.089 --> 41:09.521
Right, because then
who wrote the letter?

41:13.354 --> 41:15.688
All I know is...

41:15.722 --> 41:19.158
that the person who wrote that
letter was living two lives.

41:21.229 --> 41:25.529
I've seen where that
double life can lead.

41:25.564 --> 41:27.032
It's straight to hell.

41:27.066 --> 41:29.135
What have you seen?

41:31.669 --> 41:34.238
I've seen that a signal
can be detected

41:34.273 --> 41:36.375
no matter how secret it is.

41:36.409 --> 41:38.309
I don't want you hanging petticoats
for Caleb Brewster anymore.

41:38.343 --> 41:40.976
Abraham, don't be hasty.

41:41.010 --> 41:43.511
Look what we've accomplished so far.

41:49.818 --> 41:52.889
Captain Simcoe's body was
not found in Connecticut.

41:55.992 --> 41:59.765
Getting rid of him was the sole reason
I risked talking to Caleb,

41:59.799 --> 42:02.068
and now he may still be alive?

42:02.102 --> 42:04.870
We have accomplished nothing.

42:07.805 --> 42:10.172
And I won't risk you further.

42:13.812 --> 42:17.113
It is too dangerous for us to meet

42:17.147 --> 42:20.047
or even see each other.
