♪♪

00:04.540 --> 00:05.880
KC: Previously
on KC Undercover...

00:05.880 --> 00:08.120
I found out Brady
had been sabotaging my missions,

00:08.120 --> 00:10.330
but I set up a trap
so I can catch him.

00:10.330 --> 00:12.120
I know all about the Raincoat,

00:12.120 --> 00:14.330
and I'm gonna help KC use it

00:14.330 --> 00:16.880
to destroy the Storm Maker.

00:16.880 --> 00:18.540
Let's go.

00:18.540 --> 00:20.750
-Hey, Cooper!
-You're kidding me!

00:20.750 --> 00:22.540
How are you here
if you're there?

00:22.540 --> 00:24.380
I'm following
KC's backup plan.

00:24.380 --> 00:26.040
If it was clear
I wasn't gonna be able

00:26.040 --> 00:27.830
to get the intel
you guys needed from Brady,

00:27.830 --> 00:29.830
I was supposed to leave,
switch places with her,

00:29.830 --> 00:31.330
and she would go back in
disguised as me.

00:31.330 --> 00:32.880
KIRA: But now KC's
a prisoner.

00:32.880 --> 00:35.290
CRAIG: Which was
her plan all along.

00:35.290 --> 00:37.460
That's my girl!

00:40.330 --> 00:44.250
What do you know
about Project Raincoat, Marisa?

00:46.080 --> 00:47.500
Oh, really.

00:47.500 --> 00:49.500
Weeks of fake dating,

00:49.500 --> 00:52.170
and I couldn't get you
to shut up.

00:52.170 --> 00:54.670
Now suddenly cat's
got your tongue?

00:54.670 --> 00:56.120
Pbbt!

00:58.830 --> 01:01.540
Fine. Enjoy rotting
in this cell,

01:01.540 --> 01:02.960
you vacuous dullard.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.380
-(lock clicks)
-Joke's on him,

01:07.380 --> 01:08.960
'cause Marisa
doesn't even know

01:08.960 --> 01:10.620
what the word "vacuous" means.

01:10.620 --> 01:12.830
Or "dullard,"
for that matter.

01:27.420 --> 01:30.620
(woman crying
through vent)

01:32.170 --> 01:33.920
Hello?

01:33.920 --> 01:36.170
-Someone there?
-Leave me alone!

01:36.170 --> 01:38.750
No, it's okay.
I'm not one of them.

01:38.750 --> 01:40.290
How do I know that?

01:40.290 --> 01:42.120
Just trust me, okay?
I won't hurt you.

01:42.120 --> 01:44.620
-What's your name?
-Gwen Pepper. I'm sorry.
It's just--

01:44.620 --> 01:46.460
I've been locked up
in here for weeks.

01:46.460 --> 01:48.120
I'm just a scientist,
but they forced me

01:48.120 --> 01:49.790
-to help them--
-It's okay.

01:49.790 --> 01:51.420
Don't worry, Gwen,
I'm gonna get us
both out of here.

01:51.420 --> 01:52.710
How are you
going to do that?

02:08.580 --> 02:11.040
I'm KC Cooper and I'm a spy
with the Organization.

02:11.040 --> 02:13.250
Saving people is, uh,
kind of my thing.

02:14.580 --> 02:16.290
In that outfit?

02:16.290 --> 02:18.750
Okay, I'm
not loving it, either.

02:23.620 --> 02:25.170
All right, so what
do they have you working on?

02:25.170 --> 02:26.500
It's called
the Storm Maker.

02:26.500 --> 02:28.330
It can create storms
so powerful

02:28.330 --> 02:30.420
they can wipe out
any coordinate they choose.

02:30.420 --> 02:32.040
They told me if I didn't
do what they said,

02:32.040 --> 02:34.040
I'd never see
my family again.

02:34.040 --> 02:35.880
Interesting, 'cause
the people I work for

02:35.880 --> 02:37.830
won't give me two seconds
away from my family.

02:39.670 --> 02:41.170
All right, you know what?
I'm gonna get us out of here.

02:41.170 --> 02:42.540
How. The laser again?

02:42.540 --> 02:43.670
Ha. Not this time.

02:51.670 --> 02:53.540
(sizzles)

02:57.500 --> 02:58.670
Okay, I take it back.

02:58.670 --> 03:00.460
I'm starting

So, what's the next move?

03:56.580 --> 03:58.710
Well, fortunately,
when KC repaired that necklace

03:58.710 --> 04:01.620
that Brady gave you, she also
put a tracking device inside.

04:01.620 --> 04:04.170
Should lead us
right to her.

04:04.170 --> 04:09.790
(whirring, rapid beeping)

04:09.790 --> 04:13.620
Oh, you mean
this necklace?

04:13.620 --> 04:15.000
Why do you still have it?

04:15.000 --> 04:17.540
Well, I sort of forgot
to give it to KC

04:17.540 --> 04:20.500
when we switched places,
but if it's any consolation,

04:20.500 --> 04:22.290
she's wearing my bra.

04:22.290 --> 04:24.210
Craig, what are
we gonna do?

04:24.210 --> 04:25.710
Our baby's out there
with no support!

04:25.710 --> 04:27.290
No, no, I just
told you, she--

04:27.290 --> 04:28.750
Not that kind of support!

04:28.750 --> 04:31.750
Calm down, calm down.
We'll figure it out.

04:31.750 --> 04:33.710
We just can't let
the Organization know

04:33.710 --> 04:35.210
that KC deviated
from the plan.

04:35.210 --> 04:36.750
(phone ringing)

04:36.750 --> 04:40.040
Ugh! It's Johnson
from the Organization.

04:40.040 --> 04:42.120
-Well, see what he wants.
-You see what he wants!

04:42.120 --> 04:45.540
I don't want to talk--
Hey, Agent Johnson.

04:45.540 --> 04:48.250
I need you and the family
to report to HQ right now.

04:48.250 --> 04:50.170
Okay, so, when you
say "family,"

04:50.170 --> 04:52.540
who exactly are
you referring to?

04:52.540 --> 04:54.080
You, Craig, and KC.

04:54.080 --> 04:56.670
Ernie's already on his way,
so get down here ASAP.

04:56.670 --> 04:59.750
I guess we have no choice
but to tell him about KC.

04:59.750 --> 05:01.380
And get her
in even more trouble?

05:01.380 --> 05:02.620
No, I don't think so.

05:02.620 --> 05:04.250
Uh, maybe you guys
could just, like,

05:04.250 --> 05:05.790
you know,
drop me off on the way.

05:05.790 --> 05:07.750
I could use
a nice, long bubble bath.

05:07.750 --> 05:11.540
Oh, no,
you're coming with us.

05:12.920 --> 05:14.330
What are they gonna do
when they see me?

05:14.330 --> 05:17.710
Oh, they won't see you.

05:22.750 --> 05:26.210
Wow! (gasps)

05:26.210 --> 05:27.830
Are those secret files?

05:27.830 --> 05:30.670
And look at all
these TV monitors!

05:30.670 --> 05:33.620
Their cable bill must be
a ♪ fortune ♪.

05:33.620 --> 05:36.710
Marisa! Marisa!
Get over here

05:36.710 --> 05:38.710
and start acting like
you got some sense.

05:38.710 --> 05:41.380
Sorry, okay, it's just
I've never been here before.

05:41.380 --> 05:43.420
Yeah, but KC's been here
a million times,

05:43.420 --> 05:44.790
so pull it together.

05:44.790 --> 05:47.290
Okay, I'll just channel
my inner KC.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.040
Let's do this.

05:53.040 --> 05:54.080
All right.

05:56.880 --> 05:58.880
Good of you
to finally show up, KC.

05:58.880 --> 06:00.830
Why, thank you,
fellow spy.

06:00.830 --> 06:05.540
I mean, 'sup, fellow spy?

06:05.540 --> 06:08.500
As we all know,
the Storm Maker
has been activated.

06:08.500 --> 06:10.170
Orange groves
in Florida are freezing.

06:10.170 --> 06:12.670
Farmland in Pennsylvania
is being flooded

06:12.670 --> 06:14.380
under a deluge of rain.

06:14.380 --> 06:16.880
We have to destroy
that machine.

06:16.880 --> 06:17.960
-KC.
-Yes!

06:17.960 --> 06:20.670
That is me, KC Cooper.
Hello.

06:20.670 --> 06:22.960
You've always been
a brilliant tactician.

06:22.960 --> 06:25.710
Any suggestions on how
we can infiltrate
the Alternate?

06:25.710 --> 06:30.710
Uh, well, can't we
just use that Raincoat thingy?

06:30.710 --> 06:32.120
(Kira laughs)

06:32.120 --> 06:33.620
Good one, honey!

06:33.620 --> 06:35.880
KC knows Raincoat
isn't real,

06:35.880 --> 06:38.170
because she made it up
to trap Brady!

06:38.170 --> 06:39.960
Remember!

06:39.960 --> 06:42.960
Oh, right. I remember!

06:42.960 --> 06:45.500
Um, but I'm actually
gonna be sitting

06:45.500 --> 06:47.790
this mission out,
so you got this, right, bro?

06:49.580 --> 06:51.080
Uh, no.

06:52.710 --> 06:55.250
I need the both of you
to track down Marisa.

06:55.250 --> 06:57.540
You find her,
you find the Storm Maker.

06:57.540 --> 06:58.920
Uh, yes, absolutely.

06:58.920 --> 07:01.120
My mom, dad, Ernie, and I

07:01.120 --> 07:02.880
will go find Marisa.

07:02.880 --> 07:04.620
We will do it all together

07:04.620 --> 07:07.000
as one big, happy family.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.710
KC, I don't know
what your problem is,
but get it together.

07:09.710 --> 07:11.880
You and Ernie
track down Marisa.

07:11.880 --> 07:14.000
Kira, you and Craig
determine why

07:14.000 --> 07:16.540
these specific locations
have been targeted.

07:16.540 --> 07:17.670
Okay, let's go.

07:18.920 --> 07:22.040
-Marisa, you need to--
-(beeps)

07:22.040 --> 07:24.330
Look, I already know
what you're gonna say,

07:24.330 --> 07:26.210
but if you expect me
to sit at home

07:26.210 --> 07:28.790
twirling my hair
while you guys save
my best friend,

07:28.790 --> 07:30.580
then you need to put down
the crazy pills,

07:30.580 --> 07:33.210
because I'm going
whether you like it or not.

07:33.210 --> 07:36.830
Actually, I was just gonna say
you need to fix your wig.

07:38.790 --> 07:42.120
What's the latest
with your little blonde friend,
Marisa?

07:42.120 --> 07:44.710
She won't tell me anything
about the Raincoat.

07:44.710 --> 07:46.500
I'm not sure
if she's playing dumb

07:46.500 --> 07:49.120
or if she's actually dumb,
or if she's super dumb

07:49.120 --> 07:51.330
and playing normal dumb,
or, I...

07:51.330 --> 07:53.710
Your mouth keeps moving,
yet I've stopped listening.

07:56.580 --> 07:58.290
Okay, what's the deal
with the guy talking to Brady?

07:58.290 --> 07:59.580
I've only seen him
once before,

07:59.580 --> 08:01.000
but everyone seems
to be afraid of him.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.540
I think he might
be in charge.

08:02.540 --> 08:04.880
REID: We don't have time
to wait around
for the Raincoat.

08:04.880 --> 08:07.500
We need to move forward
with Phase 2 of the plan.

08:07.500 --> 08:10.420
A catastrophic storm
that'll hit
the Capitol building.

08:10.420 --> 08:13.080
And then the Alternate
will reign supreme.

08:14.880 --> 08:16.920
They're trying
to take out the Capitol.

08:16.920 --> 08:18.670
I need to get in contact
with my family.

08:18.670 --> 08:19.880
Yell for help, okay?

08:19.880 --> 08:21.210
I'm kind of soft-spoken.

08:21.210 --> 08:23.210
I don't think your family's
gonna hear me.

08:23.210 --> 08:25.040
Just do it.

08:25.040 --> 08:27.500
Help.

08:27.500 --> 08:30.210
Help!

08:30.210 --> 08:31.710
What are you doing
out of your cell?

08:31.710 --> 08:33.170
Creating a diversion.

08:33.170 --> 08:36.790
(fight grunts)

08:40.620 --> 08:41.750
(mouths)

08:43.330 --> 08:44.830
(ringing)

08:44.830 --> 08:46.710
Hello?

08:46.710 --> 08:49.170
-Dad, it's KC.
-KC! Where are you?

08:49.170 --> 08:51.580
I'm at
the Alternate's Headquarters.
I'll send you the coordinates.

08:51.580 --> 08:53.670
Listen, I figured out
what they're doing
with the Storm Maker.

08:53.670 --> 08:55.080
Yeah, we know, they're
trying to mess with the crops.

08:55.080 --> 08:56.790
No, that is
just a distraction.

08:56.790 --> 08:58.250
They're trying
to take out the Capitol.

08:58.250 --> 08:59.960
Craig, tonight is
the State of the Union address.

08:59.960 --> 09:02.250
Every member
of Congress is gonna be
in the Capitol building.

09:02.250 --> 09:05.330
Then the Alternate's goal
is to wipe out
the entire federal government.

09:05.330 --> 09:06.540
We have to warn them.

09:06.540 --> 09:08.080
KC, stay safe.
Help is on the way.

09:10.920 --> 09:12.960
Okay, so are
we almost there?

09:12.960 --> 09:15.290
Because I feel like we're
just going in circles here.

09:15.290 --> 09:18.250
Not far now.
So, what are you gonna do
once you find the Storm Maker?

09:18.250 --> 09:19.880
Well, destroy it,
of course.

09:19.880 --> 09:21.460
Right, but how
will you destroy it?

09:21.460 --> 09:23.920
Do you have some type
of device that can stop it?

09:23.920 --> 09:25.960
I heard them talking
about a Project Umbrella

09:25.960 --> 09:28.120
or Galoshes
or something like that.

09:28.120 --> 09:29.120
Project Raincoat?

09:29.120 --> 09:30.960
Yes! That's it.

09:32.120 --> 09:33.580
Raincoat. Do you
have it on you?

09:33.580 --> 09:35.000
I'd love to see it,
you know,

09:35.000 --> 09:37.080
just to check out
the specs and everything.

09:37.080 --> 09:39.920
I am fascinated
with anti-technology technology.

09:39.920 --> 09:41.330
How 'bout you lead me
to the Storm Maker

09:41.330 --> 09:42.500
and I'll show it
to you there.

09:42.500 --> 09:46.670
How about we do it
my way.

09:46.670 --> 09:48.170
Now, hand it over.

09:48.170 --> 09:49.540
I'm not handing you
over anything.

09:49.540 --> 09:51.380
We'll see about that.

09:53.040 --> 09:54.500
(over PA)
I have KC Cooper secured.

09:54.500 --> 09:55.830
She has the Raincoat.

09:55.830 --> 09:58.420
I repeat,
she has the Raincoat.

09:58.420 --> 10:00.460
Now, hand it over!

10:00.460 --> 10:02.000
Over my dead body.

10:06.750 --> 10:08.500
That could be arranged.

10:13.750 --> 10:16.080
You're a scientist.
Why are you helping them?

10:16.080 --> 10:19.250
It's all about
the Benjamins, baby.

10:19.250 --> 10:21.920
Plus, you made it
so easy.

10:21.920 --> 10:23.710
All I had to do
was break out the theatrics

10:23.710 --> 10:25.750
and I knew you'd
spill everything.

10:25.750 --> 10:28.540
"Help, help!
I'm a poor scientist

10:28.540 --> 10:30.880
in need of a big, strong spy."

10:30.880 --> 10:33.040
"I'll help you, little lady.

10:33.040 --> 10:36.920
I'm KC Cooper, and kickin'
butt's my middle name."

10:36.920 --> 10:40.290
You sounded so stupid!

10:40.290 --> 10:43.830
What I said was way cooler
than that, and you know it.

10:43.830 --> 10:48.000
Give me Project Raincoat,
or else.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.040
Or else what?

10:49.040 --> 10:50.750
Or else I'll shoot.

10:50.750 --> 10:52.790
Okay, go ahead. Do it.

10:55.120 --> 10:57.170
What's wrong?

10:57.170 --> 10:58.380
Do I need to get
a little closer

10:58.380 --> 11:00.080
so that baby scientist
won't miss?

11:01.670 --> 11:04.000
Is that close enough?

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
Stop it, seriously,
I will shoot you.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.170
Aah! Dah!

11:08.170 --> 11:10.330
You know, for a scientist
you're not very smart.

11:10.330 --> 11:12.830
Now, show me to the Storm Maker
and tell me how to shut it off.

11:12.830 --> 11:15.920
Or else what,
is baby spy gonna break my-- Ow!

11:15.920 --> 11:18.540
Okay, okay, you're not bluffing.
I'll tell you!

11:23.330 --> 11:26.380
Whoa! Where'd all
this rain come from?

11:26.380 --> 11:28.620
I can barely see the road!

11:28.620 --> 11:31.210
Craig, why didn't you put
the new windshield wipers

11:31.210 --> 11:33.040
on the car like I asked?

11:33.040 --> 11:35.790
'Cause it wasn't supposed
to rain until next weekend!

11:35.790 --> 11:38.330
You know what else
wasn't supposed to happen?

11:38.330 --> 11:41.790
Nobody was supposed to take out
the entire US government

11:41.790 --> 11:43.500
with a catastrophic
weather machine!

11:43.500 --> 11:45.710
Yet, here we are.

11:45.710 --> 11:47.920
The Alternate
is doing this, Craig.

11:47.920 --> 11:50.170
They're trying to keep us
from getting to the Capitol.

11:50.170 --> 11:53.000
Oh, wow!

11:53.000 --> 11:55.710
And now they trying
to stop us with hail!

11:55.710 --> 11:57.040
(snap)

11:57.040 --> 11:59.500
It's just broke
the windshield wiper.

11:59.500 --> 12:03.210
I bet you glad I didn't put
the new one on now, aren't you?

12:09.580 --> 12:11.080
Our intel was correct, Reid.

12:11.080 --> 12:13.080
I'm locked in
on the Coopers' car.

12:13.080 --> 12:14.500
Did you stop them
from getting to the Capitol?

12:16.170 --> 12:17.170
No, they're still en route.

12:17.170 --> 12:18.920
Then turn it up, genius!

12:20.710 --> 12:23.170
(whirring )

12:25.040 --> 12:26.830
Okay, according to KC,

12:26.830 --> 12:28.830
the Alternate base
is 50 yards due north.

12:28.830 --> 12:31.040
We should be close enough
to hack into the computer system

12:31.040 --> 12:32.880
and hopefully shut down
the Storm Maker.

12:32.880 --> 12:35.170
Great, and I will sneak in
and back up KC.

12:35.170 --> 12:36.420
Just make sure
to take that bag.

12:36.420 --> 12:39.250
It's got all
my tactical gear in it.

12:39.250 --> 12:43.880
Ernie, uh, unless tactical
means grossing out the bad guys

12:43.880 --> 12:47.000
with your old gym socks?
I mean...

12:47.000 --> 12:49.580
I think you grabbed
the wrong bag.

12:49.580 --> 12:52.380
No, it only looks
like I grabbed the wrong bag.

12:52.380 --> 12:54.460
I do that in case
anyone goes into it.

12:54.460 --> 12:57.040
Always thinkin'.

12:57.040 --> 12:59.170
And stinkin'.

12:59.170 --> 13:02.670
Underneath that stuff
is a pen, a flashlight,

13:02.670 --> 13:04.960
a hairbrush,
and a pack of gum.

13:04.960 --> 13:07.170
You put the pen
and the flashlight together

13:07.170 --> 13:08.710
to make a laser gun,

13:08.710 --> 13:10.960
and the hairbrush
is really a communicator.

13:10.960 --> 13:13.210
Oh, cool! And the gum,

13:13.210 --> 13:15.670
is that some sort of,
like, explosive thing?

13:15.670 --> 13:17.080
No, that's for your breath.

13:17.080 --> 13:20.080
Whatever you had for lunch
is not doing you any favors.

13:24.710 --> 13:26.460
System's almost
at full strength.

13:26.460 --> 13:29.540
It's time
to take out the Capitol.

13:29.540 --> 13:31.540
I don't think so.

13:32.670 --> 13:34.880
-It's over.
-KC Cooper.

13:34.880 --> 13:37.790
-As tenacious as advertised.
-Glad you think so,

13:37.790 --> 13:39.330
'cause as soon as
I take out this machine,

13:39.330 --> 13:40.580
you're gonna be next.

13:40.580 --> 13:42.250
You should be working
with us, KC.

13:42.250 --> 13:43.710
We're the next generation.

13:43.710 --> 13:46.250
It is up to us to destroy
the failing old way

13:46.250 --> 13:50.330
so that from their ashes,
a new, superior world can rise.

13:50.330 --> 13:53.330
All right, are we done
talking like a comic book?

13:53.330 --> 13:55.080
I need you to step
away from that machine.

13:55.080 --> 13:57.250
MARISA: Yeah, you
heard her, move!

14:01.170 --> 14:04.790
The Alternate
will not reign supreme.

14:06.790 --> 14:09.330
That's a good one, right?

14:09.330 --> 14:11.170
Marisa, what
are you doing here?

14:11.170 --> 14:12.750
Oh, I'm here to save you.

14:12.750 --> 14:15.460
I even brought
this cool laser
flashlight thingy. Lookit!

14:17.250 --> 14:18.250
Aah!

14:20.380 --> 14:22.920
See? You're not the only one
who can do some cool moves.

14:22.920 --> 14:24.960
Yeah, well, I do know
that you're not
gonna shoot me.

14:24.960 --> 14:26.420
But we will.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.620
(chirps)

14:34.380 --> 14:36.210
(metallic thumping
and KC groaning)

14:37.710 --> 14:40.170
Uh, KC, I'm pretty sure
they locked it.

14:40.170 --> 14:42.580
Mm, you think?

14:44.500 --> 14:48.000
The Coopers
are going nowhere fast.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
Finally, I'm
in their system.

14:50.000 --> 14:53.210
I'll see your blizzard
and raise you some sunshine!

14:54.540 --> 14:56.670
Wait, where'd that
sunshine come from?

14:56.670 --> 14:58.290
-Hey, what's going on?
-I don't know.

14:58.290 --> 14:59.420
Just get it working again!

14:59.420 --> 15:01.290
One Category 4 tornado
coming up,

15:01.290 --> 15:03.920
with a little lightning
to make things interesting.

15:05.210 --> 15:06.920
Oh, no, you didn't!

15:08.250 --> 15:10.080
(thunder crashing)

15:11.250 --> 15:12.830
Craig, we need to get
somewhere safe.

15:12.830 --> 15:14.290
I'm trying!

15:14.290 --> 15:16.040
Turn on the radio.
Check the news.

15:16.040 --> 15:19.580
-Okay.
-(radio) The snow is really
coming down out there.

15:19.580 --> 15:21.830
But, wait, it's clearing up
and the forecast

15:21.830 --> 15:24.120
looks like it'll be
in the low 120s.

15:26.330 --> 15:30.080
Wait, what?
Hold on.

15:30.080 --> 15:33.290
Now a tornado is approaching
the Capitol building!

15:33.290 --> 15:35.620
What the--!

15:35.620 --> 15:37.330
What do we do?
What do we do?
What do we do?

15:37.330 --> 15:39.620
Stop saying, "What do we do?"
It's not helping.

15:41.830 --> 15:43.420
Wait a minute, Storm Maker
can't produce

15:43.420 --> 15:45.120
its weather patterns
without a transmitter, right?

15:45.120 --> 15:47.420
I have no idea
what you're talking about,

15:47.420 --> 15:49.580
but if it helps,
I'll say yes.

15:49.580 --> 15:51.920
Okay, so if we find
that transmitter,

15:51.920 --> 15:54.290
then we can stop
all this destruction, right?

15:54.290 --> 15:57.380
So clueless,
so here's another yes.

15:57.380 --> 16:01.670
And it would have
to be high enough to emit
an unobstructed signal.

16:01.670 --> 16:03.210
-Let's go, Marisa.
-Where are we going?

16:03.210 --> 16:04.710
To the roof
to stop the transmitter.

16:07.540 --> 16:10.460
Okay, okay, I'm starting
to think we should've
taken the elevator.

16:15.080 --> 16:16.960
-Okay.
-(banging)

16:16.960 --> 16:19.290
Ernie, hey. We got, uh,
we got some company.

16:19.290 --> 16:20.960
I can see that
on the monitor,

16:20.960 --> 16:22.500
but I got my own problems.

16:22.500 --> 16:24.170
Someone's hacking me back.

16:24.170 --> 16:25.960
I'm trying to blow
the storm out to sea,

16:25.960 --> 16:28.460
but every time I make wind,
they make hail!

16:28.460 --> 16:30.080
Okay, well, try again!
Okay, bro?

16:30.080 --> 16:33.330
There's nobody better
at making wind than you!

16:33.330 --> 16:35.620
While you're at it,
see if you can put a blizzard
right on top of the building.

16:35.620 --> 16:37.670
-Why?
-Marisa, tell him the plan.

16:41.040 --> 16:43.290
There's a transmitter
thingy on the roof,

16:43.290 --> 16:45.500
and we need you
to freeze it out.

16:45.500 --> 16:46.500
I'm on it.

16:50.710 --> 16:52.290
Get him!

16:55.880 --> 16:57.880
That's gonna leave a mark.

17:02.540 --> 17:05.420
KC, are you
almost done up there?

17:13.250 --> 17:15.000
I am now!

17:15.000 --> 17:16.580
Come on up!

17:16.580 --> 17:18.580
Uh, excuse me, sir.

17:25.170 --> 17:26.830
There's the transmitter!

17:26.830 --> 17:29.000
I can barely see
anything up here!

17:29.000 --> 17:33.380
BRADY:
This is all you need to see!

17:33.380 --> 17:36.330
Well, well,
if it isn't KC Cooper

17:36.330 --> 17:38.540
and her trusty
sidekick Marisa.

17:38.540 --> 17:40.330
Get behind me, Marisa.

17:40.330 --> 17:41.710
(wind gusts)

17:41.710 --> 17:43.540
Here comes
Ernie's blizzard.

17:43.540 --> 17:44.790
MARISA:
He came through!

17:48.580 --> 17:51.380
Now, back up!
I said back up!

17:53.000 --> 17:55.540
You heard me,
back up.

17:55.540 --> 17:59.120
But if we back up any further,
we'll fall off the roof.

17:59.120 --> 18:01.830
Oh, did you figure
all that out by yourself?

18:01.830 --> 18:05.420
Oh, and to think I called you
a vacuous dullard.

18:05.420 --> 18:07.920
I'm sorry, a what what?

18:07.920 --> 18:10.040
Marisa, when we get
home, remind me

18:10.040 --> 18:12.500
to download that
vocab app on your phone.

18:12.500 --> 18:16.620
Okay, for the last time,
back up!

18:17.830 --> 18:19.210
Okay, you beat us, Brady.

18:19.210 --> 18:20.750
But I just have one question.

18:20.750 --> 18:23.460
How did you know every move
I made before I made it?

18:23.460 --> 18:26.620
What, seriously?
You didn't know?

18:26.620 --> 18:30.580
Marisa. She told
me everything--

18:30.580 --> 18:33.080
where you were going,
what you were doing,

18:33.080 --> 18:38.000
and she was only too happy
to spy on her best friend.

18:39.210 --> 18:41.040
Marisa, how could you
betray me like this?

18:41.040 --> 18:42.620
KC, I already told you--

18:42.620 --> 18:44.460
Marisa, stop making
excuses, okay?

18:44.460 --> 18:46.580
You stabbed me in the back
and you turned against me.

18:46.580 --> 18:48.580
Well, I hope you're happy,
because you're about
to get us both killed.

18:51.420 --> 18:55.000
Well, you know what?
Maybe if you had supported me

18:55.000 --> 18:58.170
and my dreams, I wouldn't've
felt like I had to spy on you!

19:02.830 --> 19:07.210
-(KC yelling)
-(Marisa screaming)

19:07.210 --> 19:10.330
Noice!
Do my dirty work for me.

19:12.290 --> 19:13.500
Oof!

19:15.080 --> 19:17.500
(both grunting)

19:17.500 --> 19:18.790
Guh!

19:19.880 --> 19:21.500
Ooh!

19:21.500 --> 19:22.960
Messing with Marisa

19:22.960 --> 19:24.540
is the last thing
you'll ever do, Brady!

19:24.540 --> 19:26.500
-You're done.
-I don't think so.

19:26.500 --> 19:28.670
The Alternate holds
all the cards now.

19:28.670 --> 19:31.290
Yeah, I think you're forgetting
about Project Raincoat.

19:31.290 --> 19:34.670
Oh, please! If Project Raincoat
was really operational,

19:34.670 --> 19:36.670
your Organization
would've used it by now!

19:36.670 --> 19:37.960
Oh, they already have!

19:37.960 --> 19:39.460
You haven't figured
it out, Brady?

19:39.460 --> 19:41.380
I'm Project Raincoat.

19:41.380 --> 19:43.120
(grunts)

19:44.540 --> 19:47.250
(fight grunts)

19:47.250 --> 19:50.670
Marisa, get the laser gun!

19:50.670 --> 19:52.500
No! Hey! Hey!

19:52.500 --> 19:53.670
Dah! Dah!

19:53.670 --> 19:56.580
(fight grunts)

19:56.580 --> 19:59.620
Lookit! I found a laser gun!

20:04.500 --> 20:05.960
Marisa, throw me the gun!

20:21.500 --> 20:24.670
It's over, Brady.
There's nowhere else
for you to run.

20:24.670 --> 20:26.920
I wouldn't be
so sure about that.

20:33.710 --> 20:35.540
A hoodie that turns
into a parachute.

20:35.540 --> 20:38.540
Noice.

20:38.540 --> 20:41.460
♪♪

20:44.120 --> 20:45.290
Here you go.

20:45.290 --> 20:46.670
Thank you.

20:46.670 --> 20:48.880
Well, I'm glad that's over.

20:48.880 --> 20:50.670
Yeah, well,
it's not really "over,"

20:50.670 --> 20:52.120
because we still have
to get Brady,

20:52.120 --> 20:53.750
but the good news is
when you become a spy

20:53.750 --> 20:55.880
with the Organization,
we can take him down together.

20:55.880 --> 20:58.380
Tsk. Yeah, I don't think so.

20:59.710 --> 21:01.880
Kind of over
this whole spy thing.

21:01.880 --> 21:04.750
Uh, what?
That doesn't make sense.

21:04.750 --> 21:06.670
This is everything
that you said that you wanted.

21:06.670 --> 21:08.670
KC, listen.

21:08.670 --> 21:14.120
Wanting to become a spy
almost completely ruined
our friendship.

21:14.120 --> 21:17.420
And nothing is worth
losing that.

21:18.960 --> 21:20.670
Plus, I have to be honest,

21:20.670 --> 21:23.250
it's all, like, really,
really, really, really hard,

21:23.250 --> 21:26.920
and I'm, like, really,
really, really, really lazy.

21:26.920 --> 21:28.960
Yeah, well, if you're waiting
for an argument,

21:28.960 --> 21:30.790
you're gonna have
to keep waiting.

21:30.790 --> 21:32.750
Oh, uh, one more question.

21:32.750 --> 21:36.750
What exactly does
"vacuous dullard" mean?

21:36.750 --> 21:41.790
Um... you know what,
it means...

21:41.790 --> 21:44.000
the best person in the world.

21:44.000 --> 21:48.790
KC, you're a vacuous dullard!

21:48.790 --> 21:50.670
So are you, Marisa.

21:50.670 --> 21:52.710
So are you.

21:53.750 --> 21:55.040
Rob, your name's on TV!
