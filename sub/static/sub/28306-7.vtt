WEBVTT

00:01.235 --> 00:04.205
ANNOUNCER: In space,
no one can hear you sc--

00:04.238 --> 00:06.340
(all screaming)

00:06.374 --> 00:08.076
ANNOUNCER: Archer 1999.

00:08.109 --> 00:10.744
Premieres Wednesday, May 29
on FXX.

00:12.780 --> 00:15.849
ANNOUNCER: FX presents
What We Do in the Shadows.

00:15.883 --> 00:17.017
[bats squeal]

00:22.290 --> 00:24.825
That's the... C-Come here.
That's the Baron.

00:24.858 --> 00:26.827
-Come on, Barry.
-Come on.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.662
(laughing):
We are so high.

00:28.696 --> 00:30.064
We're on drugblood.

00:30.098 --> 00:31.732
Put the hat on.
Oh, yeah...

00:31.765 --> 00:34.435
-Oh! Ugh, no.
-LASZLO: Shit.

00:34.468 --> 00:37.605
-NADJA: I broke his half off.
-NANDOR: His bodies' half off.

00:37.638 --> 00:39.540
LASZLO:
No, no, no, he's just coming
through the floor.

00:39.573 --> 00:41.008
Guillermo?

00:41.041 --> 00:43.077
Help us!
Don't just stand there.

00:43.111 --> 00:45.246
I don't think that's Guillermo.

00:45.279 --> 00:46.947
-Guillermo?
-LASZLO: No.

00:46.980 --> 00:49.683
N-No, Nandor,
that's the StairMaster.

00:49.717 --> 00:51.452
The master of the stairs.

00:51.485 --> 00:53.554
-We fucked up. This is bad.
-Where's Guiller...

00:53.587 --> 00:55.423
(in distance):
Guillermo!

00:55.456 --> 00:58.426
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God. Oh, my God...

00:58.459 --> 01:00.594
("You're Dead"
by Norma Tanega playing)

01:00.628 --> 01:03.063
* Don't sing if you want
to live long *

01:03.097 --> 01:05.599
* They have no use
for your song *

01:05.633 --> 01:08.236
* You're dead, you're dead,
you're dead *

01:08.269 --> 01:10.604
* You're dead
and out of this world *

01:12.673 --> 01:15.743
* Now your hope and compassion
is gone *

01:15.776 --> 01:18.479
* You sold out your dream
to the world *

01:18.512 --> 01:20.881
* Stay dead, stay dead,
stay dead *

01:20.914 --> 01:22.983
* You're dead
and out of this world. *

01:23.016 --> 01:25.186
*

01:33.093 --> 01:35.263
(bell tolling)

01:35.296 --> 01:39.133
NANDOR: We are gathered here
tonight in our backyard

01:39.167 --> 01:42.436
to commemorate
the second death of the Baron.

01:42.470 --> 01:44.838
NADJA: We are having a ceremony

01:44.872 --> 01:46.674
to commemorate
the Baron's passing.

01:46.707 --> 01:47.741
Problem is, though,

01:47.775 --> 01:49.410
we don't remember how he died,

01:49.443 --> 01:50.644
because we were absolutely

01:50.678 --> 01:52.846
messed up on drugblood.

01:52.880 --> 01:55.949
And as a sign of respect,
we have decided to bury you

01:55.983 --> 01:58.952
betwixt my two favorite vaginas:

01:58.986 --> 02:02.656
that of my wife and my mother.

02:02.690 --> 02:05.959
Baron, such a wonderful,
filthy times

02:05.993 --> 02:07.328
we did have.

02:07.361 --> 02:08.996
-(snickering)
-What a way

02:09.029 --> 02:10.698
to live your life after death,

02:10.731 --> 02:12.466
and what a way to die.

02:13.467 --> 02:15.303
(bell tolling)

02:16.337 --> 02:17.705
Did we murder him?

02:17.738 --> 02:19.540
LASZLO:
We, um, we might have
floated the idea

02:19.573 --> 02:22.443
of murdering him,
but we didn't do it.

02:22.476 --> 02:23.677
Did we?

02:23.711 --> 02:25.913
NADJA:
Oh, I think something
awful happened.

02:29.016 --> 02:30.884
Fuck.

02:30.918 --> 02:33.020
LASZLO:
Maybe we should
keep this under our hats.

02:33.053 --> 02:34.988
If any vampires
find out about this,

02:35.022 --> 02:36.690
then it... (quacks)

02:36.724 --> 02:38.492
(bell tolling)

02:43.564 --> 02:45.366
Give the Baron his last sip.

02:45.399 --> 02:46.734
-Of course.
-(Nadja humming a tune)

02:48.336 --> 02:49.570
(Nandor and Laszlo
humming along)

02:49.603 --> 02:52.172
NADJA:
So just get him in.

02:52.206 --> 02:53.541
-Yep.
-Goodbye, Baron.

02:53.574 --> 02:54.842
(raven squawks)

02:54.875 --> 02:56.544
Master, there's a raven
looking at us.

02:56.577 --> 02:58.246
(squawking)

02:58.279 --> 03:00.381
It is a bad omen.
It means that

03:00.414 --> 03:02.483
bad luck is approaching.

03:02.516 --> 03:03.484
-Hey, gang.
-(all groan)

03:03.517 --> 03:05.152
What's up? Oh!

03:05.185 --> 03:06.153
Oh, my God.

03:06.186 --> 03:08.188
Did-did you guys kill him?

03:08.222 --> 03:10.324
-No! No one murdered him.
-No! What... He was just...
-We found him in there.

03:10.358 --> 03:11.692
(laughs):
I'm just giving you guff.

03:11.725 --> 03:14.662
And, uh, just so you know, I am
feeding on you guys right now.

03:14.695 --> 03:16.430
NADJA:
You can be such a prick, Colin.

03:16.464 --> 03:18.165
COLIN:
I have heard that.

03:18.198 --> 03:20.701
Shit.
The Baron's familiar.

03:20.734 --> 03:22.570
(ravens squawking)

03:22.603 --> 03:24.772
There's more ravens.
They're giving me the shits.

03:24.805 --> 03:27.241
NANDOR:
Guillermo, shield us
from the ravens.

03:27.275 --> 03:29.109
NADJA:
The sky is filled with them.

03:29.142 --> 03:30.578
-No, let's just go inside.
-Let's go inside.

03:30.611 --> 03:33.046
Fill the hole.
Keep filling.

03:33.080 --> 03:34.448
GUILLERMO:
But the ravens...

03:34.482 --> 03:35.616
NADJA:
They're everywhere!

03:35.649 --> 03:37.618
(whimpers)

03:37.651 --> 03:40.087
There are ravens all over
the front lawn now, too.

03:40.120 --> 03:42.923
They're trying to frighten us.
But it won't work.

03:42.956 --> 03:44.525
-(thump)
-ALL: Aah!
-NADJA: What is going on?

03:44.558 --> 03:46.527
-GUILLERMO: Master.
-ALL: Aah!
-LASZLO: Ay yai yai.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.195
There's a floating woman
on the front porch.

03:48.228 --> 03:49.497
She needs to talk to you.

03:54.735 --> 03:57.371
You have been summoned...

03:57.405 --> 03:58.772
(thunder claps)

03:58.806 --> 04:02.042
...to appear before
the Vampiric Council

04:02.075 --> 04:05.513
at the Temple
of Blood-Devourers.

04:06.580 --> 04:08.282
Could you not have
just telephoned?

04:08.316 --> 04:10.584
We sent ravens.

04:10.618 --> 04:13.220
We sent 500 ravens!

04:13.253 --> 04:15.222
Yes, but we have a telephone.

04:15.255 --> 04:18.392
I'm shocked and appalled
that you didn't raven us back.

04:18.426 --> 04:20.227
We didn't know how.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.496
You just say,
"Raven, we will be there.

04:22.530 --> 04:24.965
Thank you. Fly."

04:26.099 --> 04:27.601
You've been invited.

04:27.635 --> 04:29.136
(thunder claps)

04:29.169 --> 04:30.304
(hissing)

04:33.841 --> 04:35.343
Couldn't you
just have telephoned?

04:39.513 --> 04:43.317
NANDOR:
The Vampiric Council
is a very ancient organization.

04:43.351 --> 04:45.986
Very powerful.
And, apparently,

04:46.019 --> 04:47.855
very scary.

04:47.888 --> 04:51.425
LASZLO:
They travel from
all corners of the globe

04:51.459 --> 04:53.527
to administer supreme
and final justice

04:53.561 --> 04:55.663
upon any vampire

04:55.696 --> 04:57.798
who's violated
the Vampiric Code.

04:57.831 --> 05:00.534
Laszlo was very nearly summoned
when he turned a baby

05:00.568 --> 05:03.270
into a vampire,
which is a big no-no.

05:03.303 --> 05:04.672
It's true.
You're not supposed to do that.

05:04.705 --> 05:07.541
But, to be honest, I was bored.

05:07.575 --> 05:09.610
I gave it to an acquaintance
in the Bronx,

05:09.643 --> 05:10.844
where, I believe,

05:10.878 --> 05:12.513
it remains to this day.

05:12.546 --> 05:15.215
That baby would be about
90 years old now.

05:15.248 --> 05:16.650
You really fucked up there.

05:16.684 --> 05:18.218
I certainly did.

05:18.251 --> 05:19.487
Maybe we should visit it.

05:19.520 --> 05:21.254
I'd rather not.

05:22.390 --> 05:23.957
Here it is.

05:23.991 --> 05:26.694
NANDOR: Okay, so, obviously,
we are all on edge.

05:26.727 --> 05:28.862
This could be about anything,

05:28.896 --> 05:32.466
-so we must say nothing
about you-know-what.
-Obviously.

05:32.500 --> 05:34.167
LASZLO:
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa...

05:34.201 --> 05:36.203
NADJA:
It is that woman.

05:38.839 --> 05:41.008
LASZLO:
I think she wants us
to come inside.

05:41.041 --> 05:42.676
Hello again.

05:44.344 --> 05:46.246
Follow me.

05:46.279 --> 05:48.215
So glad you could make it.

05:48.248 --> 05:50.418
(clears throat)

05:54.021 --> 05:55.288
-(elevator bell chimes)
-Oh.

05:57.290 --> 05:59.092
Enter.

05:59.126 --> 06:00.528
(whispers):
How did she do that?

06:02.229 --> 06:04.865
(Muzak playing)

06:04.898 --> 06:06.366
-(elevator bell chimes)
-Oh.

06:08.135 --> 06:10.003
And we're here.

06:10.037 --> 06:12.072
And follow me.

06:12.105 --> 06:13.441
How does she do that?

06:15.142 --> 06:18.111
The Tribunal have gathered
in the Chamber of Judgment,

06:18.145 --> 06:19.747
and there
you'll be put on trial.

06:19.780 --> 06:22.349
NADJA:
Why does this hallway never end?

06:22.382 --> 06:25.385
Well, it's just
a freaky-long hallway.

06:33.794 --> 06:35.863
I thought the Council
was bigger than that.

06:35.896 --> 06:37.898
-Maybe we can battle them.
-Shh!

06:37.931 --> 06:39.032
GUIDE:
Enter.

06:39.066 --> 06:40.868
Not the human.

06:40.901 --> 06:42.803
Vampire-only trial, Guillermo.

06:45.673 --> 06:47.541
What will happen to me?

06:47.575 --> 06:50.077
Oh, you'll see.

06:50.110 --> 06:52.145
(laughs, coughs)

06:52.179 --> 06:53.881
Sorry, I have a...

06:53.914 --> 06:55.583
little blood bubble
in my throat.

06:55.616 --> 06:56.817
(clears throat)

06:56.850 --> 06:58.752
You'll see...

06:58.786 --> 07:00.420
a room at the end of the hallway

07:00.454 --> 07:02.289
for the familiars.

07:02.322 --> 07:05.392
Ludwig will take you
to the familiar lounge.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.561
Ludwig. Ludwig.

07:07.595 --> 07:09.062
Ludwig!

07:09.096 --> 07:10.598
I'll just do it.
Follow me.

07:10.631 --> 07:11.932
Watch your step.

07:11.965 --> 07:14.134
I don't have to, I glide.

07:15.836 --> 07:18.472
Good evening,
Your Excellencies.

07:18.506 --> 07:21.842
This is Vasillika the Defiler.

07:21.875 --> 07:23.310
Hello.

07:23.343 --> 07:25.312
And I am...

07:25.345 --> 07:27.314
Garrett.

07:27.347 --> 07:28.816
Garrett the...

07:28.849 --> 07:30.317
The vampire.

07:30.350 --> 07:31.351
Simple. Nice.

07:31.384 --> 07:33.253
Hi, Garrett the vampire.

07:33.286 --> 07:35.989
Now, what happened
with the Baron?

07:36.023 --> 07:37.858
-He's dead.
-Oh...

07:37.891 --> 07:40.661
-Sorry, everyone.
-It w... We didn't
make him dead.

07:40.694 --> 07:42.996
LASZLO:
No, it's true.
It was a misunderstanding.

07:43.030 --> 07:45.699
Um, as a joke, we said,
"Why not kill the Baron?"

07:45.733 --> 07:47.467
And if you were there
at the time,

07:47.501 --> 07:48.869
-you, too, would have laughed.
-NANDOR: (chuckles) Yes.

07:48.902 --> 07:51.471
Now we realize that it was
probably a stupid thing to say,

07:51.505 --> 07:53.607
and we are truly sorry,

07:53.641 --> 07:55.442
and we're taking this
very seriously.

07:55.475 --> 07:56.810
And these are our serious faces.

07:56.844 --> 08:00.614
Serious, serious, serious.

08:00.648 --> 08:02.750
GUIDE:
Follow.

08:05.152 --> 08:06.353
What are you doing?

08:06.386 --> 08:08.622
I'm warming my face.
It's so cold in here.

08:08.656 --> 08:10.490
Well, it's an LED light.

08:10.524 --> 08:13.293
-Oh.
-There's no way
we could have fire.

08:13.326 --> 08:16.263
The fire marshals
would have a fit.

08:19.399 --> 08:20.968
I have to say

08:21.001 --> 08:23.403
we are deeply moved

08:23.436 --> 08:25.673
by your story,
and-and maybe it's just me,

08:25.706 --> 08:27.074
but I don't think
you're guilty at all.

08:27.107 --> 08:28.341
-Vasillika?
-Mm, no,

08:28.375 --> 08:29.743
I don't think you sound guilty.

08:29.777 --> 08:33.046
I-I think...
they might let you go.

08:33.080 --> 08:35.048
Sorry, what do you mean
by "they"?

08:35.082 --> 08:37.484
VASILLIKA:
The Vampiric Council.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.319
You're not the Vampiric Council?

08:39.352 --> 08:41.088
-(laughs)
-Oh. (laughing)

08:41.121 --> 08:43.323
GARRETT (laughing):
No. No, we're...

08:43.356 --> 08:44.524
-we're prisoners here.
-No, we have

08:44.558 --> 08:46.159
-been imprisoned
in this boring room
-Oh...

08:46.193 --> 08:49.229
for... 1,000 years?

08:49.262 --> 08:52.099
-Oh, it's really awful.
-Since 1932.

08:52.132 --> 08:53.734
Mm.

08:53.767 --> 08:56.236
That's not 1,000 years.

08:56.269 --> 08:58.572
What-what year is it?

08:58.606 --> 09:00.307
It's 2019.

09:02.375 --> 09:04.077
We have been here for 90 years.

09:04.111 --> 09:05.746
-GARRETT: Oh, shit.
-What did you do?

09:05.779 --> 09:07.915
Oh, me?
Too much defiling.

09:07.948 --> 09:10.083
They say I turned a baby
into a vampire

09:10.117 --> 09:11.919
and left it in the Bronx.

09:11.952 --> 09:15.388
Who would do such a thing?
If I ever find out who did it,

09:15.422 --> 09:18.626
I will take a dagger
and stab them 5,000 times

09:18.659 --> 09:22.129
with this hand,
switch hands, and stab them

09:22.162 --> 09:24.231
another 5,000 times!

09:24.264 --> 09:27.067
I can fill up this book

09:27.100 --> 09:30.470
with the ways I would
torture that vampire.

09:32.505 --> 09:34.041
Wouldn't want to be him.

09:34.074 --> 09:37.010
-That poor baby.
-Poor, poor baby.

09:38.646 --> 09:42.482
The Vampiric Council
will see you now.

09:42.515 --> 09:45.552
-Doesn't have to be right now.
-I mean, right now...

09:45.585 --> 09:48.622
-Right now. I... They had
a break, but they're ready now.
-They...

09:53.160 --> 09:55.162
(door slams shut)

10:00.668 --> 10:03.771
Hey.
Are you a familiar, too?

10:03.804 --> 10:05.806
Yes.

10:05.839 --> 10:07.607
Welcome.

10:18.618 --> 10:19.920
(bell tolling)

10:19.953 --> 10:23.490
This is the chamber
where you will be tried.

10:23.523 --> 10:25.659
You could hang...

10:25.693 --> 10:29.129
-Hang?
-...here, until
the trial starts.

10:29.162 --> 10:30.798
I think we're ready.

10:30.831 --> 10:32.099
-No...
-NANDOR: We are not ready.
-GUIDE: Yes. We are ready.

10:32.132 --> 10:33.300
NANDOR: No, we're not...
-What? What's going...

10:33.333 --> 10:36.369
The spectacle
of judgment begins.

10:36.403 --> 10:38.806
*

10:38.839 --> 10:40.841
LASZLO:
What the hell is this?

10:56.389 --> 10:58.525
That's very elaborate.

10:58.558 --> 11:00.027
GUIDE:
Since this may be
your last night

11:00.060 --> 11:01.995
of existence,
the Vampiric Council

11:02.029 --> 11:05.365
likes to do something
a little bit special.

11:05.398 --> 11:07.968
They rehearsed it for decades.

11:08.001 --> 11:09.402
*

11:16.844 --> 11:18.746
LASZLO:
This is very odd.

11:18.779 --> 11:20.781
*

11:34.194 --> 11:35.528
-(music ends)
-(bell tolls)

11:39.699 --> 11:42.569
-(bell tolling)
-What the blazes is this?

11:44.104 --> 11:46.539
Dark greetings of the night

11:46.573 --> 11:48.541
to all the members

11:48.575 --> 11:51.879
of the Vampiric Council,
from all the continents,

11:51.912 --> 11:55.548
gathered here together on...

11:55.582 --> 11:57.584
-(whispers): Staten Island.
-On St...

11:57.617 --> 11:59.920
O-On Staten Island.

11:59.953 --> 12:03.757
VIAGO:
Welcome, vampires
from near and far,

12:03.791 --> 12:07.560
to this here
grand Vampiric Council,

12:07.594 --> 12:11.064
to judge over
these three accused.

12:11.098 --> 12:14.434
Accused of what, you may ask.

12:14.467 --> 12:15.769
-Murder...
-Vampire murder.

12:15.803 --> 12:17.805
-Vampire murder.
-Sor... vampire murder.

12:17.838 --> 12:20.540
(hissing)

12:20.573 --> 12:23.410
VIAGO:
So that's why we're here.

12:23.443 --> 12:25.278
I'll now introduce
the leaders of the council,

12:25.312 --> 12:28.581
starting here with Tilda.

12:28.615 --> 12:30.217
Pretty much our leader.

12:30.250 --> 12:31.985
-She's the one who makes
all the big decisions.
-Hello.

12:33.854 --> 12:35.422
Welcome, Tilda.

12:35.455 --> 12:39.392
I am Viago Von Dorna Schmarten

12:39.426 --> 12:41.795
Scheden Heimburg.

12:41.829 --> 12:43.630
This is Deacon Brucke.

12:43.663 --> 12:46.099
-Hello.
-Vladislav the Poker.

12:46.133 --> 12:47.801
We also have

12:47.835 --> 12:49.269
Evan, the Immortal

12:49.302 --> 12:51.905
Princess of the Undead.

12:51.939 --> 12:53.340
You don't have to say my whole
name. You can just say Evan,

12:53.373 --> 12:54.975
it's fine.
-VIAGO: Or just Evan.

12:55.008 --> 12:56.776
Who else do we have?
Danny.

12:56.810 --> 12:59.112
Hey, Danny. With his shirt off,
as usual.

12:59.146 --> 13:02.082
Cool Mexican tattoos
all over his chest.

13:02.115 --> 13:05.118
-Dark greetings, everyone.
-VIAGO: Welcome, Danny.

13:05.152 --> 13:08.588
-We also have Paul.
-Dark greetings, everyone.
Dark greetings.

13:08.621 --> 13:12.125
Great to be here.

13:12.159 --> 13:15.996
-Rob... Wh...
Is Rob here? Is...
-Couldn't make it.

13:16.029 --> 13:18.598
-We couldn't get Rob?
-Uh, no, I-I talked to Rob,
he didn't...

13:18.631 --> 13:21.201
didn't want to come.
Want to... leave it behind.

13:21.234 --> 13:22.502
VIAGO:
That's fine. No, he didn't want

13:22.535 --> 13:25.205
-to be here. Kiefer?
-I don't see Kiefer.

13:25.238 --> 13:27.440
Kiefer said that he wanted
to do it, but he couldn't come.

13:27.474 --> 13:29.542
-He was busy?
-Tom and Brad...

13:29.576 --> 13:30.978
-VLADISLAV: Tom, not... No.
-VIAGO: Not interested.

13:31.011 --> 13:33.313
-Tom and Bra... Well...
-VIAGO: Not into it.

13:33.346 --> 13:34.814
They're not committed like us.

13:34.848 --> 13:36.850
It's just an availability thing.

13:36.884 --> 13:39.819
-Well, who is here?
-VIAGO: Calling in via Skype,

13:39.853 --> 13:43.056
we have Wesley over there,
the day-walker.

13:43.090 --> 13:44.457
-TILDA: Wesley!
-VIAGO: Hey, Wesley.
-Is this working?

13:44.491 --> 13:46.659
-VIAGO: Look at him then...
-Oh, God, not this fucking guy.

13:46.693 --> 13:48.996
He is a vampire killer!

13:49.029 --> 13:51.364
Hey, he is half vampire.

13:51.398 --> 13:53.500
His opinion still counts.

13:53.533 --> 13:56.703
-Yeah, well, I'm only listening
to half his opinion.
-(hisses)

13:56.736 --> 13:58.738
-DANNY: Look at him
in the sunlight.
-VLADISLAV: Showing off.

13:58.771 --> 14:00.840
-Can you hear me?
-Wesley, can you hear us?

14:00.874 --> 14:02.209
-Hey, can you hear me?
-VLADISLAV: There's a lag.

14:02.242 --> 14:04.912
The Skype seems glitchy.

14:04.945 --> 14:07.147
-Hello?
-Push the mute button.
-TILDA: It looks like

14:07.180 --> 14:09.382
a little microphone,
it's got a-got a ring around it.

14:09.416 --> 14:10.550
-I'm pushing it.
-VIAGO: Can you hear us now?

14:10.583 --> 14:13.253
I can hear you.
Dark greetings.

14:13.286 --> 14:14.888
Okay. Great.

14:14.922 --> 14:16.823
Moving on. As is vampire law,

14:16.856 --> 14:18.858
we also have
a local vampire here

14:18.892 --> 14:22.029
on the council this evening,
Colin Robinson.

14:22.062 --> 14:23.430
Hello.

14:23.463 --> 14:25.032
What the fuck
are you doing here?

14:25.065 --> 14:26.733
Okay, now...

14:26.766 --> 14:28.835
So why are we gathered
on "Statee" Island?

14:28.868 --> 14:31.038
Because one of our brothers
has passed from this world.

14:31.071 --> 14:35.575
Baron Afanas,
also known as The Undying One.

14:35.608 --> 14:38.845
Well, he died.
That's why we're here.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.047
Call the witness.

14:40.080 --> 14:42.049
First witness.

14:42.082 --> 14:43.850
-Oh, good grief.
-Oh, shit.

14:43.883 --> 14:45.953
Where the hell
did she come from?

14:45.986 --> 14:48.956
This is Baron Afanas' familiar.

14:48.989 --> 14:51.858
Witness number one, speak.

14:51.891 --> 14:54.861
(whispers):
It's okay. She doesn't speak.

14:54.894 --> 14:58.865
On the eve of the death
of my master...

14:58.898 --> 15:00.067
(whispers):
Well, she's speaking now.

15:00.100 --> 15:02.535
...these three vampires

15:02.569 --> 15:05.638
-took Baron Afanas...
-(whispers): She's speaking.

15:05.672 --> 15:09.943
...and they let him partake
of human food.

15:09.977 --> 15:11.878
(vampires groaning, hissing)

15:11.911 --> 15:14.948
We cannot eat human food.
It's gross.

15:14.982 --> 15:16.316
DANNY:
The fuck is wrong with you guys?

15:16.349 --> 15:17.584
BARON'S FAMILIAR:
Earlier,

15:17.617 --> 15:21.254
I overheard them
plotting to murder him.

15:21.288 --> 15:22.956
(vampires gasping, hissing)

15:22.990 --> 15:24.791
She speaks the bullshit.

15:24.824 --> 15:27.127
We simply floated the idea.

15:27.160 --> 15:28.928
You floated the idea
of murdering him?

15:28.962 --> 15:32.065
-LASZLO: Yes.
-Not floated, you plotted.

15:32.099 --> 15:34.734
-Floating and plotting
are very similar.
-WESLEY: Wait,

15:34.767 --> 15:37.670
-The Baron is dead?
-VIAGO: Oh, my God, Wesley,

15:37.704 --> 15:39.439
-we're past that now.
-Wesley, catch up,
we're past that.

15:39.472 --> 15:41.841
-Remove the witness.
-VIAGO: Yeah.
-Thanks a lot.

15:41.874 --> 15:44.411
-Bye, bitch.
-WESLEY: Human food?
Like-like-like

15:44.444 --> 15:46.579
-hamburger
or some-something like that?
-VIAGO: Wesley.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.181
We're over the human food thing.
Shut up.

15:48.215 --> 15:49.916
We're not talking
about that, Wesley.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.351
You need better Wi-Fi.

15:51.384 --> 15:53.987
Move the computer
next to your router, homes.

15:54.021 --> 15:55.822
Hey, hey, hey.
It's not my Wi-Fi.

15:55.855 --> 15:58.191
I got the best Wi-Fi. Okay?

15:58.225 --> 16:00.860
I heard about one familiar
who was made into a vampire,

16:00.893 --> 16:04.631
and now he has a big castle
and he is really successful...

16:04.664 --> 16:08.168
My master says I'm gonna be
a vampire in a few days.

16:08.201 --> 16:10.603
It's only been seven decades.

16:10.637 --> 16:13.006
So, have any of you

16:13.040 --> 16:16.743
met a familiar
who's become a vampire?

16:18.845 --> 16:19.946
Not personally,

16:19.979 --> 16:22.382
never met one.

16:22.415 --> 16:26.719
Well, I'll be a vampire soon,
and then you'll know a vampire.

16:26.753 --> 16:29.056
And then you can
become my familiar.

16:29.089 --> 16:31.691
Did anyone really like
The Baron, anyway?

16:31.724 --> 16:34.361
-Well, I... no, I didn't
like him. He was creepy.
-I mean, I didn't...

16:34.394 --> 16:37.997
-He was loco.
-I thought he was pretty rude
and a backstabber.

16:38.031 --> 16:40.067
-He was a bit of an asshole.
-Loco.

16:40.100 --> 16:41.534
He was a psychotic madman.

16:41.568 --> 16:42.869
Aren't we all, though?
A little bit?

16:42.902 --> 16:44.071
DEACON:
He was a whackjob,

16:44.104 --> 16:46.706
he was crazy,
but rules are rules.

16:46.739 --> 16:48.741
-VIAGO: Now what?
-Bring in the other witness.

16:48.775 --> 16:50.843
-VIAGO: Now let us call
the next witness.
-LASZLO: What other witness?

16:50.877 --> 16:53.513
-PAUL: Another witness.
-VIAGO: Witness number
whatever-it-is.

16:53.546 --> 16:55.248
-LASZLO: Oh, my life.
-Guillermo.

16:55.282 --> 16:56.716
VIAGO:
Who's this
delicious-looking thing?

16:56.749 --> 16:58.685
What is this?
Is this-is this lunch?

16:58.718 --> 16:59.919
-NADJA: Yes, it's lunch.
-No, it's not lunch.

16:59.952 --> 17:01.088
It's lunch.

17:01.121 --> 17:03.856
GUIDE:
This is one of their
familiars, council.

17:03.890 --> 17:04.991
He bears witness.

17:05.024 --> 17:07.194
Did these vampires three

17:07.227 --> 17:09.762
murder The Baron?

17:09.796 --> 17:11.064
No, they did not.

17:11.098 --> 17:13.266
Did they "float" it?

17:13.300 --> 17:16.002
They discussed it,
but they-they were just talking.

17:16.035 --> 17:17.670
They weren't going
to really do it.

17:17.704 --> 17:20.540
VLADISLAV:
So who murdered The Baron?

17:20.573 --> 17:22.309
Um...

17:26.446 --> 17:29.316
They... It was I.
I-I killed him.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.519
-You did it?
-Yes.

17:32.552 --> 17:33.720
(stifled laugh)

17:33.753 --> 17:35.255
It was I.
I did it.

17:35.288 --> 17:37.390
Okay. Unlikely.

17:37.424 --> 17:40.293
Don't take offense,
but you don't seem like someone

17:40.327 --> 17:42.529
who would be capable
of killing a vampire.

17:42.562 --> 17:44.264
-But I did it.
-Uh, hard to believe.

17:44.297 --> 17:46.065
-Well, I did.
-From maybe
a tougher-looking guy,

17:46.099 --> 17:49.102
-I'd believe it, but...
-TILDA: I think you're lying

17:49.136 --> 17:50.703
-to protect your master.
-VIAGO: Of course he is.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.739
This little guy
couldn't kill a vampire.

17:52.772 --> 17:54.941
No, it was, it was me. I opened
the door and it was dawn

17:54.974 --> 17:56.376
and then the sun came in and...

17:56.409 --> 17:58.311
(stammers)
and then it happened.

17:58.345 --> 18:00.713
That sounds very made-up.

18:00.747 --> 18:02.048
VIAGO:
I mean, I don't know, guys.

18:02.081 --> 18:03.950
None of us really liked
The Baron,

18:03.983 --> 18:06.386
so maybe we just kill
this cute little guy

18:06.419 --> 18:08.421
and then let
the other three go.

18:08.455 --> 18:09.589
Send his soul to hell.

18:09.622 --> 18:11.391
Does anyone else
feel like having

18:11.424 --> 18:14.494
-a cheeky little snack?
-Sneaky snack?

18:14.527 --> 18:16.496
-(vampires hissing)
-VLADISLAV:
What do you think, Wesley?

18:16.529 --> 18:19.499
Who is this motherfucker now?
This glasses motherfucker?

18:19.532 --> 18:20.767
PAUL:
It's lunch, Wesley.

18:20.800 --> 18:23.236
-Lunch.
-Oh, yeah.
-No!

18:23.270 --> 18:24.771
NANDOR:
I cannot abide by this.

18:24.804 --> 18:26.973
-(exhales): Oh.
-Get to the point.

18:27.006 --> 18:30.577
-Have you got a point to make?
-Listen to me.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.912
-We're all listening.
-You got...
Everyone's listening.

18:32.945 --> 18:34.347
-Everyone's like...
-Everyone has stopped
what they were doing,

18:34.381 --> 18:35.848
we were all about to chomp down
on this guy,

18:35.882 --> 18:38.451
and then you said,
"Oh, I'm gonna say something."

18:38.485 --> 18:40.453
-Speak.
-It was we...

18:40.487 --> 18:42.922
-NADJA: No.
-who killed The Baron.

18:42.955 --> 18:44.524
We thought that!
That's what we thought.

18:44.557 --> 18:46.793
-We-we...
-We were all discussing that.

18:46.826 --> 18:47.860
TILDA:
You have committed

18:47.894 --> 18:51.097
premeditated vampicide.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.032
Pass the judgment, Tilda.

18:53.065 --> 18:54.934
TILDA:
I pronounce these three

18:54.967 --> 18:56.769
guilty.

18:56.803 --> 18:59.172
Raise your fangs, all who agree.

18:59.206 --> 19:01.374
(vampires hissing)

19:04.644 --> 19:06.213
(cries)

19:06.246 --> 19:08.014
The punishment is

19:08.047 --> 19:10.149
they will be killed
in the same manner

19:10.183 --> 19:11.551
that their victim was:

19:11.584 --> 19:14.120
exposed to sunlight.

19:14.153 --> 19:16.689
-Ooh!
-VIAGO: Ow, Chihuahuas.

19:16.723 --> 19:17.790
(snarls)

19:17.824 --> 19:19.526
Man, that's fucking rough.

19:19.559 --> 19:21.961
You gonna help us,
Colin Robinson?

19:21.994 --> 19:23.563
Fuck can I do?

19:23.596 --> 19:25.798
GUIDE:
Follow me to your doom.

19:25.832 --> 19:27.200
Don't worry.

19:27.234 --> 19:30.570
I've coordinated
a secret escape plan.

19:32.004 --> 19:33.373
Bat!

19:33.406 --> 19:35.208
NADJA:
Laszlo, you fucking asshole!
How could...

19:35.242 --> 19:37.244
-How could...
-Ludwig, get him.

19:37.277 --> 19:40.280
Dan, get her.

19:43.015 --> 19:44.984
Watch the hands, Mr. Hands!

19:45.017 --> 19:47.654
Fucking hell!

19:47.687 --> 19:51.090
Release my blade.

19:51.123 --> 19:53.059
-Ooh.
-Is it welded on there, or...?

19:53.092 --> 19:55.027
Well, it's for
decoration, really.

19:55.061 --> 19:58.164
-Thank you, Ludwig, very good.
-Fuck me.

19:58.197 --> 19:59.999
What is that?
Uh... Hey!

20:00.032 --> 20:02.201
He's a vampire, he couldn't get
an ax off a wall.

20:02.235 --> 20:03.770
Well, you should see it.

20:03.803 --> 20:06.005
It's, like, welded on there
or something.

20:06.038 --> 20:08.074
(sighs)

20:08.107 --> 20:09.876
We have to find a way
out of here.

20:09.909 --> 20:11.511
This is the thing
where we wa... Okay,

20:11.544 --> 20:14.714
I broke this, turned right, and
then we turned left to the...

20:14.747 --> 20:16.616
-(roars)
-(screams)

20:16.649 --> 20:17.784
-Stay back!
-(screams)

20:19.819 --> 20:21.454
Oh...

20:21.488 --> 20:22.755
(groaning)

20:23.790 --> 20:24.757
(quietly):
It was an accident.

20:24.791 --> 20:27.026
It was an accident.
It was an accident.

20:27.059 --> 20:28.495
It was an accident!

20:31.731 --> 20:34.467
So, they're being sent
into a well, and, uh,

20:34.501 --> 20:36.703
the sun's going
to slowly come up,

20:36.736 --> 20:39.105
-and then they'll burn to death.
-It's a very horrible way
to die.

20:39.138 --> 20:42.775
-Very dramatic way to die.
-(chuckles): Yes.

20:42.809 --> 20:45.312

20:47.680 --> 20:50.249
(Laszlo, Nandor, and Nadja
screaming)

20:57.089 --> 20:58.625
That's so macabre.

20:58.658 --> 21:00.460
They could have
at least cleared them up

21:00.493 --> 21:02.929
before putting us in here.

21:02.962 --> 21:04.964

(screaming)

21:10.269 --> 21:11.604
(hissing)

21:11.638 --> 21:13.606
I wish I had made more
of my leadership skills.

21:13.640 --> 21:15.608
I could have ruled
many more countries

21:15.642 --> 21:19.312
-instead of dying in a well
with two perverts.
-(mouths)

21:19.346 --> 21:21.581
I was Jack the Ripper.

21:21.614 --> 21:24.016
I've never told
anyone that before.

21:24.050 --> 21:25.852
And I wish I'd made love more.

21:25.885 --> 21:28.287
Well, you did that a lot.
A lot.

21:28.321 --> 21:30.957
-I suppose I did.
-Yeah, a-a lot.

21:30.990 --> 21:33.426
I miss my horse John.

21:33.460 --> 21:37.163
I wish I was better to him.
And to you both.

21:37.196 --> 21:40.166
That's very kind of you, Nandor,
to say that, and, um,

21:40.199 --> 21:44.003
I know we haven't got on
over the years, but, uh...

21:44.036 --> 21:46.973
Nope, that's it.

21:47.006 --> 21:49.509
I hate to say it,
but I think it's gonna hurt.

21:49.542 --> 21:52.379
-(crying): Oh, no!
-Fucking Colin Robinson.

21:52.412 --> 21:55.114
-Oh, shit.
-No! No!

21:55.147 --> 21:57.984
-Save me! Oh, Gregor,
I love you!
-No! No!

21:58.017 --> 22:00.453
Gregor!

22:00.487 --> 22:02.855
-Oh, my love, my love...
-(screams) I'm burning!

22:02.889 --> 22:04.857
(Nadja screaming)

22:04.891 --> 22:06.493
(gasping, panting)

22:06.526 --> 22:08.995
-I-It is an eclipse.
-What is that?

22:09.028 --> 22:11.130
Hey, dudes. It's me,
Colin Robinson, your roommate.

22:11.163 --> 22:13.566
-(groans)
-(whispers): Colin Robinson?
-COLIN: Yeah,

22:13.600 --> 22:15.668
Guillermo's here, too. He was
running around, peeing himself.

22:15.702 --> 22:17.303
I didn't pee myself, Master.

22:17.336 --> 22:19.138
-He was freaked out.
-No, I wasn't.

22:19.171 --> 22:21.808
So, anyway, I, uh, I was walking
by this hardware store

22:21.841 --> 22:23.576
and I says to myself,
"Colin, you should go in

22:23.610 --> 22:26.913
and, uh, see if they have
any umbrellas for the well."

22:26.946 --> 22:29.749
Made sure to keep the receipt,
I'm gonna probably take it back.

22:29.782 --> 22:31.418
You can do that
on non-food items.

22:31.451 --> 22:34.053
-Is he zapping our energy?
-He's taking advantage of us.

22:34.086 --> 22:36.188
-Don't do that.
-Shut up.

22:36.222 --> 22:38.024
Do you not want me to stay?
I can... I'll go.

22:38.057 --> 22:40.427
-No, no, no, no, no! No!
-No, don't do that! No!

22:40.460 --> 22:42.261
(chuckles)
Just giving you guys guff.

22:42.294 --> 22:44.030
Yeah, I'm gonna save you.

22:44.063 --> 22:46.399
You guys awake?

22:46.433 --> 22:49.836
-(bats screeching)
-Hello?

22:49.869 --> 22:52.104
(chuckles): Oh, no,
a roller coaster for vampires.

22:52.138 --> 22:54.206
(laughs)

22:54.240 --> 22:57.677
-Oh, no, oh, no!
Roller coaster again.
-Stop it, Colin Robinson.

22:57.710 --> 23:00.179
And sorry about the camera crew
at the bottom of the well.

23:00.212 --> 23:02.549
You're gonna want to get them
out sooner than later.

23:02.582 --> 23:04.316
They're in-they're in
grave danger.

23:06.252 --> 23:09.055
-You had a heck
of a day, too, huh?
-Yeah.

23:09.088 --> 23:12.124
-How long have you been with us?
-Ten years.

23:12.158 --> 23:14.561
I guess that's
the whole deal, right?

23:14.594 --> 23:16.195
That, you know,
you work for him,

23:16.228 --> 23:19.832
and he eventually turns you
into a, uh, a vampire?

23:22.101 --> 23:23.470
Yeah.

23:23.503 --> 23:25.472
That's the deal.

23:25.505 --> 23:28.107
* Can't trust his kind today *

23:31.277 --> 23:35.247
* Love has died
and death is here to stay... *

23:36.315 --> 23:37.584
(birds chirping)

23:39.318 --> 23:42.288

23:42.321 --> 23:46.292
* On a cloud so far away *

23:46.325 --> 23:50.262
