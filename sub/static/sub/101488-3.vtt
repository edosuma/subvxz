00:22.189 --> 00:23.522
-Even for us.
-Yeah,

00:23.715 --> 00:25.524
our dishwasher
doesn't work that well.

00:25.675 --> 00:28.252
-And it leaks. And it's old.
-Look who's talking.

-Hey, at least everything else
in the kitchen works great.
-Mm.

00:31.556 --> 00:33.681
Hey, Teddy.
Can I get you a burger?

00:33.701 --> 00:35.350
Make it a double.
I skipped breakfast.

a whole bunch of bacon.

LOUISE: Hey, Teddy,
has your truck always had

00:38.789 --> 00:40.205
a huge metal tub attached to it,

00:40.398 --> 00:42.023
and I'm just noticing it now?

00:42.043 --> 00:43.950
Uh, someone hired me
to get it out of their yard.

00:44.086 --> 00:45.527
They just bought their house,

00:45.546 --> 00:47.271
and the tub was there
when they moved in.

00:47.331 --> 00:49.048
The previous owner had a horse.
Used to drink out of it.

00:49.241 --> 00:50.440
Wow. Lucky tub.

00:50.501 --> 00:51.775
So, what are you gonna do
with it?

00:51.835 --> 00:52.943
I'm taking it to the dump.

00:53.003 --> 00:54.720
-Dump.
-Can I go sit in it?

00:54.871 --> 00:57.631
-Okay, sure.
-I'll join you
for a little tub sit.

00:57.725 --> 01:00.375
Maybe I could horse around
in there. (chuckles)

01:00.436 --> 01:02.636
-Hello, burger children.
-Can't talk, tub-sittin'.

01:02.788 --> 01:04.788
Look who swam in.
It's the Fisches.

01:04.848 --> 01:07.066
Hey, Bob, it's our landlords.

01:07.259 --> 01:08.917
Hello, Bob and female Bob.

01:08.986 --> 01:11.719
Uh, hey. Uh, I think
we paid the rent this month.

01:11.822 --> 01:13.297
Are you here to congratulate us?

01:13.357 --> 01:15.390
Or-or do you want food?

01:15.493 --> 01:17.467
-Ooh, I'd love a frittata.
-Oh, uh, I mean,

01:17.528 --> 01:19.727
-do you want a burger?
-Ugh, no.

01:19.747 --> 01:21.062
Bob, I've just purchased

01:21.123 --> 01:22.489
a building
on the other side of town

01:22.641 --> 01:24.157
that I'm turning
into storage units.

01:24.251 --> 01:25.659
And the basement
of that building

01:25.753 --> 01:27.235
was once a nightclub.

01:27.296 --> 01:29.755
And I'm gonna reopen it
and manage it

01:29.924 --> 01:31.815
and call it Jazz-aret.

01:31.875 --> 01:33.592
Ooh, congratulations!

01:33.761 --> 01:36.336
And you're telling us this
because...

01:36.430 --> 01:38.597
-We want you to be the chef.
-Oh. I...

01:38.790 --> 01:40.599
Yeah, I want to do
a whole bar menu thing.

01:40.792 --> 01:43.176
I want to do Jazz Balls,
which will be meatballs.

01:43.329 --> 01:45.920
And I want to do Scat Cakes,
which will be crab cakes.

01:45.981 --> 01:48.832
I'm not sure you want
the word "scat" on your menu.

01:48.892 --> 01:51.944
And also, I-I can't.
I have a restaurant.

01:52.095 --> 01:53.337
Bob, we'd never dream

01:53.397 --> 01:54.838
of asking you
to give up all this.

01:54.898 --> 01:58.117
We're in the process
of hiring a perma-chef.

01:58.310 --> 01:59.676
In the meantime,
you could fill in.

01:59.695 --> 02:00.786
Just for tomorrow night.

02:00.955 --> 02:02.955
Which happens to be
opening night.

02:03.106 --> 02:04.439
I-I-I don't think so.

02:04.458 --> 02:06.016
We'll give you a month's rent
for free.

02:06.034 --> 02:07.960
-Okay, I'll do it.
-A month's rent in one night

02:08.153 --> 02:09.444
is more than we make in a month!

02:09.505 --> 02:11.521
Fantastic.
Why don't you come by later

02:11.540 --> 02:13.190
so you can see the club, hmm?

02:13.292 --> 02:15.450
Make sure the kitchen, you know,
has all the food things

02:15.469 --> 02:18.286
and, uh, spoons
or whatever you cooks call

02:18.347 --> 02:20.046
the sad little tools
of your trade.

02:20.199 --> 02:21.531
I think "spoons" is right.

02:21.550 --> 02:23.249
Uh, okay, sure.
I'll come by after we close.

02:23.394 --> 02:25.126
I'm coming, too. I want to see

02:25.187 --> 02:26.870
what a real<i> Casablanca</i>
looks like.

02:26.930 --> 02:28.129
But without all the Nazis.

02:28.149 --> 02:29.648
Come on, Felix.
Let's go tend

02:29.799 --> 02:31.150
to your little project.

02:31.343 --> 02:33.318
Stop calling my nightclub
a little project.

02:33.487 --> 02:35.762
Speaking of little projects,
does someone have to go pee-pee?

02:35.823 --> 02:38.323
-You keep squeezing.
-I'm just excited.

02:38.516 --> 02:40.492
What do we do with our hands
when we're excited?

02:40.644 --> 02:41.735
-Squeeze our...
-No.

02:41.887 --> 02:43.236
If you put your ear
up to the side,

02:43.330 --> 02:44.571
you can almost hear
the horse drinking.

02:44.665 --> 02:45.831
I hear a farmer peeing.

02:45.982 --> 02:47.166
Well, I don't know
about you guys,

02:47.359 --> 02:48.983
but I'm thinking
we just found ourselves

02:49.044 --> 02:50.652
our very own swimming pool.

02:50.754 --> 02:52.820
Huh. I guess if our standards
are really low.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.673
-But that sounds like us.
-RUDY: Hey, guys.

02:54.866 --> 02:56.675
Rudy Rudy Fresh and Tootie.

02:56.826 --> 02:58.826
'Cause you tooted
in assembly yesterday.

02:58.846 --> 03:00.679
-You bet I did.
-Hi, kids.

03:00.830 --> 03:03.089
We're going to pick up my dad's
Internet friend at the airport.

03:03.184 --> 03:04.457
So, what are you guys doing
in there?

03:04.518 --> 03:06.018
Hanging out in our new pool.

03:06.187 --> 03:07.352
That doesn't look like a pool.

03:07.521 --> 03:09.188
It will
when it's filled with water

03:09.381 --> 03:10.764
and has less rust.

03:10.858 --> 03:13.525
You know who has a great pool?
Chloe Barbash.

03:13.677 --> 03:16.010
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Remember her pool party
last year?

03:16.071 --> 03:17.512
Damn.

03:17.573 --> 03:19.531
Cannonball!

03:19.724 --> 03:21.349
Did I get you?

03:21.368 --> 03:23.610
Well, our pool isn't like
Chloe's show-offy pool.

03:23.704 --> 03:25.037
Ours has tetanus.

03:25.188 --> 03:26.688
Hey, Rudy, we got to roll.

03:26.707 --> 03:28.373
Sheila said she just landed,
and she's starving.

03:28.525 --> 03:29.616
Okay. Bye, guys.

03:29.768 --> 03:31.526
Hey, kids.
I don't mean to break up

03:31.587 --> 03:33.286
whatever you're doing
in an empty metal tub

03:33.439 --> 03:35.105
that doesn't at all
make me feel bad for you,

03:35.123 --> 03:36.456
but I got to get going.

03:36.592 --> 03:38.124
Teddy, since you're
just throwing this out,

03:38.219 --> 03:39.218
can we have it?

03:39.386 --> 03:40.777
Really? Why do you want it?

03:40.837 --> 03:42.221
We're gonna use it as a pool.

03:42.414 --> 03:44.056
Okay. Now I feel worse for you.

03:44.225 --> 03:45.782
But, sure, you guys can have it.

03:45.801 --> 03:47.226
Should we ask
your mom and dad first?

03:47.419 --> 03:48.876
No, no, no, no, no, no.
We can't.

03:48.938 --> 03:51.121
Because... it's<i> for</i> them.

03:51.223 --> 03:54.124
It's a present
for their, um, anniversary,

03:54.142 --> 03:56.384
and that's-- oh, wow--
that's tomorrow.

03:56.487 --> 03:58.128
Their anniversary's
not tomorrow.

03:58.146 --> 04:00.647
Oh, yeah, I know.
But the anniversary

04:00.741 --> 04:03.725
of the day that they
first went swimming together is.

04:03.786 --> 04:05.135
Their swim-iversary.

04:05.195 --> 04:06.912
Swim-iversary.
I got to mark that down.

04:07.063 --> 04:08.321
You want me to bring it in now?

04:08.457 --> 04:10.398
No, no, no, no.
It's got to be a surprise.

04:10.417 --> 04:11.733
Can you bring it around back

04:11.752 --> 04:13.418
and help us hide it
with some trash?

04:13.587 --> 04:15.312
That won't be hard. It<i> is</i> trash.

04:15.372 --> 04:16.755
So, we're gonna swim
in the alley?

04:16.924 --> 04:18.573
Like rats after a rainstorm.

04:18.592 --> 04:20.333
No, we're gonna stash it
in the alley,

04:20.486 --> 04:21.760
and then when we get a chance,

04:21.953 --> 04:23.670
we're going to install it
in the basement.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.822
And we'll bring it down
when they're not looking.

04:25.882 --> 04:27.507
Basement pool. Very romantic.

04:27.659 --> 04:29.584
Bob and Linda are lucky
to have kids like you.

04:29.687 --> 04:31.161
They really are.

04:31.179 --> 04:33.254
Ugh. I don't want to do this.

04:33.357 --> 04:35.849
Free month's rent, Bob.
Come on. Let's go in.

04:35.943 --> 04:37.609
Wow. It's...

04:37.802 --> 04:39.945

04:41.824 --> 04:43.264
Yep. The Fischoeders

04:43.284 --> 04:45.025

working here.

04:45.177 --> 04:47.435
I'm bartending, but, uh, you
know, I really don't know how.

04:47.454 --> 04:49.195
Did you guys know there's
more than one kind of liquor?

04:49.348 --> 04:51.123
-BOB: Hmm.
-Hey, I'm working
on a signature drink.

04:51.274 --> 04:52.791
-You want to try it?
-Ooh, ooh, yeah.

04:52.942 --> 04:54.442
Oh. Oh, what is it?

04:54.503 --> 04:57.187
Beer, wine, milk, pretzel sticks
and protein powder.

04:57.247 --> 04:58.780
-You're gonna want
to stir that up.
-Oh.

when you're gonna be home

07:46.658 --> 07:48.633
so that I can stop crying
around that time.

07:48.785 --> 07:51.285
-Hmm.
-Aw.
-Hey, Gene, Tina, I, uh,

07:51.346 --> 07:54.288
I made a friendship bracelet
out of, uh, dental floss.

07:54.391 --> 07:55.865
It's in the bathroom.
You want to see?

07:55.926 --> 07:57.124
-Sure.
-Okay.

07:57.144 --> 07:58.477
So, where's the floss bracelet?

07:58.628 --> 08:00.812
-There is no floss bracelet.
-What the hell?!

08:00.964 --> 08:02.889
Listen, Mom and Dad
are going out tonight,

08:03.025 --> 08:05.650
and we've got a perfectly hidden
tub in the back alley.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.969
So I'm thinking pool party.

08:08.030 --> 08:09.879
-Hmm.
-Ooh.

08:09.898 --> 08:12.215
Yeah. In fact, I think we should
invite a few people over.

08:12.275 --> 08:13.733
Have a poolwarming.

08:13.885 --> 08:15.719
Every pool party's
a poolwarming, honey.

08:15.820 --> 08:17.829
We got to get that thing
down to the basement today

08:17.981 --> 08:19.723
so we can fill it for tonight.

08:19.783 --> 08:21.816
But won't Mom and Dad be mad
about us dragging a giant tub

08:21.835 --> 08:23.484
into the basement,
filling it with water,

08:23.587 --> 08:25.820
and having a secret
poolwarming party in it?

08:25.839 --> 08:27.154
No. Next question.

08:27.257 --> 08:29.156
Um, let's not do this?
Question mark?

08:29.218 --> 08:31.158
Hey, what if we invite
Jimmy Jr.?

08:31.220 --> 08:33.202
Interesting. Visualizing.

08:33.204 --> 08:34.571
But what do we do about Jen?

08:34.631 --> 08:36.406
Won't she stop us
from pool partying?

08:36.466 --> 08:38.666
Come on. It's Jen.
Remember when we told her

08:38.727 --> 08:40.352
it was super-duper
daylight savings time

08:40.521 --> 08:42.854
and we should move the clocks
back seven hours?

08:43.047 --> 08:44.672
We all shared a sunrise.

08:44.733 --> 08:47.192
Hey, Felix, uh,
can I talk to you for a second?

08:47.385 --> 08:49.419
-Uh, about the menu?
-Hold on, Bob. No, no, no.

08:49.479 --> 08:51.846
The little lampshades
go over the candles.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.365
Oh, I told him to take them off.

08:53.558 --> 08:55.683
As your lawyer and your cousin,
I have to advise you

08:55.744 --> 08:57.610
that you can't put a lampshade
over a candle.

08:57.746 --> 09:00.038
-They go on fire.
-Well, not right away.

09:00.231 --> 09:01.765
-So, what do I do?
-Remove it.

09:01.825 --> 09:02.874
-Mm.
-Sorry, Felix,

09:03.026 --> 09:04.617
-can I just...?
-What is it, Bob?

09:04.711 --> 09:06.360
-Is something wrong
with the kitchen?
-No, no.

09:06.380 --> 09:08.121
The kitchen's great.
I-I-I love being there.

09:08.273 --> 09:09.381
I don't even like leaving it.

09:09.574 --> 09:11.124
But I-I had a thought
about the menu.

09:11.218 --> 09:12.959
Maybe instead of Scat Cakes,

09:13.053 --> 09:15.870
we call them Crabby-os?
Like "daddy-o"?

09:15.931 --> 09:17.797
-Mm, daddy-no.
-Oh.

09:17.891 --> 09:19.224
What do you think of this wall?

09:19.375 --> 09:21.059
I'm thinking
about knocking it down.

09:21.252 --> 09:22.710
I want to put in a jazzy nook

09:22.729 --> 09:25.121
for make-out sessions
and jazzy nooky.

09:25.223 --> 09:27.214
Uh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Don't do that.

09:27.234 --> 09:29.734
There's a sewage main behind
that wall, and if you hit it,

09:29.927 --> 09:31.795
you'll have raw sewage
all over the place,

09:31.855 --> 09:34.239
which is inadvisable
for a couple of reasons.

09:34.432 --> 09:35.982
-And those reasons are?
-Pee-pee.

09:36.076 --> 09:37.817
-Poo-poo.
-The big one-two.

09:37.911 --> 09:39.560
All right, fine, no nook.

09:39.580 --> 09:43.064
I'm gonna go change into
my new nightclub owner outfit.

09:43.083 --> 09:45.566
-Hope he kept the receipt.
-(laughs)

09:45.627 --> 09:48.420
-What's so funny?
-Oh, nothing, Bob.

09:48.589 --> 09:51.089
Happy cooking tonight.
Break a greasy leg.

09:51.240 --> 09:52.573
Okay, here's the plan.

09:52.634 --> 09:54.667
Tina, Gene, and I
are gonna distract Mom

09:54.761 --> 09:57.153
while, Teddy, you carry the tub
to the basement

09:57.213 --> 09:58.488
and then use
the hose you brought--

09:58.548 --> 10:00.340
-thank you-- to fill it.
-Got it.

10:00.492 --> 10:02.992
And if I get crushed by the tub
on the stairs,

10:03.053 --> 10:04.585
try to move my body

10:04.605 --> 10:06.587
so it won't ruin
Bob and Linda's swim-iversary.

10:06.648 --> 10:08.331
-It's their special day.
-You got it.

10:08.350 --> 10:09.590
Okay, let's go distract Mom.

10:09.693 --> 10:11.167
I think I'm gonna wear
my new swimsuit

10:11.227 --> 10:12.852
to the pool party.
It's kinda crazy.

10:12.988 --> 10:14.520
It has a stripe,
but it's diagonal.

10:14.615 --> 10:17.340
-What?!
-And guess
how many pieces it is.

10:17.359 --> 10:19.025
It rhymes with "fun." It's one.

Yeah. Maybe you should, uh,

10:28.353 --> 10:29.794

10:29.946 --> 10:31.020

-(grunting continues)
-Oh, um, yeah.

10:39.514 --> 10:41.381

(lips smacking) Well, these
don't taste like jazz at all.

11:02.704 --> 11:04.329
Where's all that jazz
we kept talking about?

11:04.522 --> 11:06.556
-I-I don't know what that means.
-You!

11:06.658 --> 11:08.649
You look very wrinkly.
Come on. Let's go steam you.

11:08.710 --> 11:11.002
Calvin, why are we
going through so much trouble

11:11.154 --> 11:12.578
with this "nightclub"

11:12.673 --> 11:14.655
when we know Felix
is just gonna get bored with it?

11:14.758 --> 11:17.734
Is it possibly because
someone wants to sing?

11:17.794 --> 11:19.252
Mr. I Love Bananas?

11:19.346 --> 11:20.920
It's "I<i> Like</i> Bananas."

11:21.056 --> 11:22.347
Uh, what are you guys
talking about?

11:22.540 --> 11:24.257
Bob, Felix is bad at things.

11:24.351 --> 11:26.910
And that's why this is
not a real nightclub.

11:26.928 --> 11:28.853
-It's not?
-Technically, this is
a private social club.

11:29.046 --> 11:31.189
-Yeah.
-So we are not required
to have any permits.

11:31.358 --> 11:32.840
-No.
-Or pay our employees.

11:32.901 --> 11:34.192
-No. Nope.
-Or taxes.

11:34.343 --> 11:35.694
Yep. Anyway,
it doesn't matter, Bob.

11:35.845 --> 11:37.420
Felix will lose interest
after tonight or tomorrow,

11:37.522 --> 11:39.422
and then we can start
our private storage unit club

11:39.524 --> 11:42.534
down here, which is where
the real money is.

11:42.685 --> 11:44.018
What's gonna happen
to the kitchen?

11:44.121 --> 11:45.278
We'll tear it apart
and sell everything.

11:45.372 --> 11:47.021
(tense):
Tear it apart? Aah!

11:47.124 --> 11:48.856
Please keep all this
to yourself, by the way.

11:48.959 --> 11:50.375
Yes, don't blab like you do.

11:50.526 --> 11:52.118
Wait, what do you mean,

11:52.212 --> 11:54.195
-Loose lips, wide hips.
-Hmm.

12:31.993 --> 12:33.734
Well, I know Chloe loves pools,

12:33.795 --> 12:35.920
so when I saw her in the hallway
at school and she ignored me,

12:36.072 --> 12:37.497
I ran after her and told her
you were getting one.

12:37.591 --> 12:40.592
Why is your pool
in a dirty basement?

12:40.761 --> 12:43.336
-Excuse me, Rudy,
when you invite a plus-one...
-Yeah?

12:43.488 --> 12:44.763
-...you need to run it by me.
-Okay.

12:44.914 --> 12:46.339
Yep, yep, totally fair.

12:54.357 --> 12:55.923
Hey, Jimmy Jr.
It's Tina.

12:55.942 --> 12:57.350
You might not recognize me
in this bathing suit.

12:57.486 --> 12:58.943
The diagonal line
might be throwing you.

12:59.136 --> 13:01.262
Yeah, it looks
like you're leaning over.

13:01.323 --> 13:04.173
-Right?
-Well, this doughnut
isn't gonna dip itself!

13:04.192 --> 13:05.691

for my throat,

13:10.240 --> 13:11.790

singers do, I think.

13:11.941 --> 13:13.182
(glumly):
Sounds good.

13:13.243 --> 13:14.292
What's wrong?
Why are you sad-cooking?

13:14.485 --> 13:16.461
Uh, I'm not supposed to say.

13:16.612 --> 13:18.021
Not supposed to say what?

13:18.122 --> 13:21.115

this club, it's a sham.

13:21.134 --> 13:22.300
What do you mean?

13:22.493 --> 13:23.635
They don't have any permits,
Lin.

13:23.828 --> 13:25.119
It's not a real business.

13:25.138 --> 13:26.712
They're just doing it
to humor Felix,

13:26.865 --> 13:29.290
and they don't think
it'll last more than 48 hours.

13:29.351 --> 13:30.716
-What?!
-Felix!

13:30.811 --> 13:32.535

13:32.595 --> 13:33.553
No. No.

13:44.157 --> 13:45.990
You think
Felix is gonna be okay?

13:46.142 --> 13:47.641
He seemed pretty upset
about me saying

13:47.661 --> 13:49.552
Mr. Fischoeder saying
this nightclub isn't real.

13:49.654 --> 13:52.722
He seems... drunk
but okay, I think.

13:52.782 --> 13:54.407
I mean, I knew
I was only filling in,

13:54.501 --> 13:56.483
but I guess
a small part of me thought

13:56.503 --> 13:58.077
we'd work at the restaurant
during the day

13:58.171 --> 14:00.079
and be nightclub people
at night.

14:00.231 --> 14:01.506
And I'd get a white jacket.

14:01.699 --> 14:02.674
And maybe a trumpet.

14:02.867 --> 14:03.916
Me, too, I guess.

14:04.069 --> 14:05.735
We'd die young, but it'd be fun.

14:05.753 --> 14:08.346
It's too late for us to die
young, but I know what you mean.

14:08.497 --> 14:10.256
Lady Burger, should we run
through it one more time

14:10.392 --> 14:11.424
before we open the doors?

14:11.518 --> 14:13.109
Not that I need to, but you do.

14:13.111 --> 14:14.519
Okay!

14:14.688 --> 14:16.521

14:55.228 --> 14:57.120
Check it out.
If I lean over like this,

14:57.138 --> 14:58.454
the line is
straight up and down.

14:58.514 --> 15:00.923
-Whoa!
-Uh... yeah.

15:01.017 --> 15:02.233
JEN:
Hey, Louise.

15:02.385 --> 15:04.127
-Aah!
-Couldn't sleep?

15:04.187 --> 15:06.571
Uh, yep. That's why I'm carrying
snacks up and down the stairs.

15:06.764 --> 15:09.723
So, are you just staring
at the TV...

15:09.784 --> 15:11.167
that's not on or...?

15:11.169 --> 15:12.485
I couldn't figure out
the remote,

15:12.621 --> 15:15.079
so I thought
I'd just sit really still. See?

15:15.272 --> 15:16.581
-Huh.
-Yeah.

15:16.774 --> 15:17.807
Here, I'll help you.

15:17.825 --> 15:19.308
This looks good.

15:19.327 --> 15:20.643
It still hasn't turned on yet.
There it goes.

15:20.662 --> 15:22.478
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah, it got better, huh?

15:22.497 --> 15:23.312
It did.

15:23.373 --> 15:24.589
Look at that crowd!

15:24.782 --> 15:26.240
Ooh, I just got nervous.

15:26.259 --> 15:27.592
I'm gonna go pee real quick
before our song.

15:27.743 --> 15:29.910
And I'm going to purchase a car
on my phone.

15:29.930 --> 15:31.671
We all have our preshow rituals.

15:31.765 --> 15:33.747
(muttering)

15:33.808 --> 15:35.249
Oh, Felix!

15:35.310 --> 15:36.509
(gently):
How you doing?

15:36.603 --> 15:38.844
I saw you drinking a lot
out there.

15:38.939 --> 15:39.845
Oh, I'm fine.

15:39.940 --> 15:40.997
Uh, what are you...

15:41.057 --> 15:42.774
gonna do with that sledgehammer?

15:42.925 --> 15:45.426
This? Oh, I'll probably
just hold it quietly.

15:45.445 --> 15:46.611
Okay.

15:46.762 --> 15:48.354
And I'm definitely
not gonna wait

15:48.448 --> 15:51.340
until the middle
of my brother's precious duet

15:51.359 --> 15:54.118
and hit a pipe with it so that
raw sewage goes everywhere

15:54.270 --> 15:55.269
and destroys this place.

15:55.330 --> 15:57.455
Felix! You can't do that!

15:57.648 --> 16:00.291
Oh, no, I was just kidding
about that.

16:00.484 --> 16:02.627
Oh, phew.
You sounded crazy.

16:02.778 --> 16:05.037
(chuckles): Yeah. Hey, Linda,
will you do me a favor?

16:05.190 --> 16:06.539
Would you go in and squeeze

16:06.633 --> 16:08.541
the toilet paper rolls
in the closet, please?

16:08.635 --> 16:10.802
I'm worried they're not fluffy
and plump enough.

16:10.995 --> 16:11.952
Okay.

16:12.055 --> 16:13.620
-(grunts)
-Oh, my God!

16:13.723 --> 16:15.122
Let me out of here!

16:15.141 --> 16:16.808
Sorry, Linda.
Can't let you run off,

16:17.001 --> 16:18.309
telling my brother about this.

16:18.502 --> 16:20.461
He and I have
some things to...

16:20.522 --> 16:21.871
hammer out.

16:21.931 --> 16:23.815
-(laughing)
-Oh, God.

16:24.008 --> 16:25.708
Oh, I still have to pee!

16:25.768 --> 16:27.877
Oh, a mop bucket.
Oh, toilet paper.

16:27.895 --> 16:29.821
You know another thing
about indoor pools

16:29.990 --> 16:32.639
that makes them<i> way</i> better
than outdoor pools?

16:32.701 --> 16:35.401
Outdoorsies have to shut
their pools down in the winter.

16:35.553 --> 16:37.553
-Your pool is leaking.
-Sure, sure.

16:37.613 --> 16:39.572
(quietly): She's so jealous.
It's so sad.
-Um...

16:39.724 --> 16:41.833
Actually, Louise,
our-our-our pool is leaking.

16:42.026 --> 16:43.743
Oh, shoot, shoot, shoot!

16:43.895 --> 16:45.319
Everyone, out of the pool!

16:45.338 --> 16:47.446
Who would have thought
a rusty old tub would leak?

16:47.507 --> 16:48.914
Yay, pool party.

16:49.067 --> 16:50.657
Shush, Chloe!

16:50.719 --> 16:53.569
I<i> was</i> going to open the show
by singing a duet,

16:53.629 --> 16:56.756
but I don't know
where my partner is,

16:56.908 --> 16:59.500
so I will stall
with a little crowd work.

16:59.561 --> 17:02.078
Hey.
What's that on your head? Hair?

17:02.138 --> 17:04.022
-Hey, have you guys seen Linda?
-Nope.

17:04.173 --> 17:05.598
Why are you asking me?!

17:05.750 --> 17:08.251
It's not like I locked her
in a closet or anything.

17:08.269 --> 17:10.086
What?!
What-what closet, Felix?!

17:10.104 --> 17:11.270
I don't know!

17:11.364 --> 17:13.422
Oh, my God.
I have to go find Linda.

17:13.524 --> 17:16.159
Hey, everybody!
I opened a bottle!

17:19.122 --> 17:21.188
Linda? You in here?

17:21.249 --> 17:22.932
Linda? Linda?

17:22.950 --> 17:25.859
And I said, "That's why
octopuses have no pants."

17:25.920 --> 17:28.437
-Linda?
-Chef Bob, everybody!

17:28.498 --> 17:32.050
You're enjoying
his great Jazz Balls right now.

17:32.243 --> 17:34.218
Everybody having fun?
This is fun, right?

17:34.411 --> 17:36.054
Working together?
(laughs nervously)

17:36.205 --> 17:38.281
It's leaking worse, Louise.
We're not bailing fast enough.

17:38.341 --> 17:40.058
It's probably because
people are so distracted

17:40.251 --> 17:41.634
by this wild swimsuit.
Damn it, suit.

17:41.728 --> 17:43.619
Well, this pool party
pooped out.

17:43.638 --> 17:46.046
Yeah, I'd love to keep bailing,
but I'm gonna bail.

17:46.107 --> 17:48.048
Oh. Okay.
Bye, Chloe!

17:48.109 --> 17:49.734
Was that too much?
No, no, that was good.

17:49.927 --> 17:52.144
Ugh! This water's
gonna get all over everything.

17:52.238 --> 17:54.238
Mom and Dad are gonna kill us.
What do we do?

17:54.431 --> 17:55.981
Turn the basement
into a koi pond

17:56.076 --> 17:57.800
and hope
Mom and Dad are enchanted?

17:57.860 --> 17:59.911
Uh, what if we sop up the water?

18:00.062 --> 18:01.487
Good idea, Jimmy Jr.

18:01.581 --> 18:03.823
Let me get my giant sponge
that doesn't exist.

18:03.975 --> 18:05.141
Oh, my God, yes.
That's it.

18:05.201 --> 18:06.400
We soak up the water.

18:06.461 --> 18:08.068
With things that soak up stuff.

18:08.088 --> 18:09.495
Everyone, open up these boxes

18:09.589 --> 18:11.089
and see what we can throw
in the pool.

18:11.282 --> 18:12.590
See, Tina?

18:12.741 --> 18:14.592
Sorry, it's the suit.
It gives me suit 'tude.

18:14.761 --> 18:17.486
I found bags of hamburger buns.
They're kind of hard.

18:17.547 --> 18:18.821
Oh, perfect.

18:18.881 --> 18:20.489
Old buns.
Let's dump 'em.

18:20.508 --> 18:22.249
Carbs, you've been good to me
all my life.

18:22.310 --> 18:24.418
Don't fail me now!

18:24.437 --> 18:26.437
-(grunting)
-BOB: Lin?

18:26.630 --> 18:28.589
-Bob?!
-I'm-I'm getting you out!

18:28.691 --> 18:29.756
Oh, thank God.

18:29.859 --> 18:30.757
Are you okay?

18:30.819 --> 18:32.501
Ooh, smells like pee.

18:32.520 --> 18:34.186
Yeah, somebody peed on the floor
near that mop bucket.

18:34.339 --> 18:37.264
Listen, Felix is gonna hit a
sewage pipe with a sledgehammer!

18:37.325 --> 18:38.858

19:10.817 --> 19:13.559
and oven and, uh,
you, too, dishwasher.

19:13.711 --> 19:17.079
I'm sorry I cheated on you
with that really nice kitchen.

19:17.081 --> 19:18.972
I mean,
y-you don't work that well.

19:19.033 --> 19:21.141
But I-I do appreciate you.

19:21.161 --> 19:22.976
And you're also part
of a real business,

19:23.037 --> 19:24.328
so that makes a difference.

19:24.521 --> 19:25.663
(high-pitched):
"That's okay, Bob.

19:25.814 --> 19:26.906
"Sometimes I fantasize

19:27.058 --> 19:28.666
about someone else
cooking on me."

19:28.859 --> 19:30.242
Really? Who?

19:30.395 --> 19:31.243
"That Muppet
with the rolling pin."

19:31.337 --> 19:32.395
The Swedish Chef?

19:32.455 --> 19:33.987
"Yeah. He's Swedish."

19:34.007 --> 19:35.173
Is he, though?

19:35.324 --> 19:36.565
Bob, finish apologizing
to the kitchen.

19:36.626 --> 19:38.234
I want to get upstairs
and change.

19:38.252 --> 19:39.585
I got closet pee stink on me.

19:39.737 --> 19:41.070
-LOUISE AND TINA: Aah!
-GENE: Oh, my God.

19:41.130 --> 19:42.847
-Aah!
-Wha? What the hell's going on?!

19:42.998 --> 19:44.089
Nothing.
No kids were here.

19:44.225 --> 19:45.758
What do you mean
no kids were here?

19:45.852 --> 19:47.092
Why are you in bathing suits?

19:47.187 --> 19:48.594
And-and what's all over you?

19:48.688 --> 19:50.188
And where's Jen?

19:50.339 --> 19:52.415
She's upstairs watching TV,
which might not be on.

19:52.475 --> 19:54.750
By the way,
this is not her fault.

19:54.810 --> 19:56.027
What's not her fault?

19:56.178 --> 19:57.420
Let's just say the basement

19:57.521 --> 19:59.030
may or may not be full
of wet buns.

19:59.223 --> 20:00.531
But not that much water!

20:00.724 --> 20:01.757
Oh, God.

20:01.817 --> 20:03.426
We said it may or may<i> not!</i>

20:03.486 --> 20:05.428
And don't ask how we know this,
but it turns out

20:05.488 --> 20:07.263
wet buns
are super fun to swim in.

20:07.281 --> 20:08.855
And whatever happened
in that basement,

20:08.875 --> 20:11.600
people are gonna be
talking about for a long time.

20:11.661 --> 20:15.028
-(laughing)
-Yeah!
-Cannon-bun!

20:15.048 --> 20:15.862
FISCHOEDER:
Burger people,

20:15.924 --> 20:16.956
we know you're here.

20:17.050 --> 20:19.032
We can hear you and smell you.

20:19.052 --> 20:20.292
Oh, God.
What do they want?

20:20.445 --> 20:21.777
I don't know,
but we should go see

20:21.837 --> 20:23.054
and not go in the basement!

20:23.247 --> 20:24.871
Bob, we owe you this:

20:24.933 --> 20:26.615
one month's rent.

20:26.676 --> 20:27.616
Oh. Thanks.

20:27.677 --> 20:28.784
It's empty.

20:28.844 --> 20:29.969
Yes, that's how it works.

20:30.063 --> 20:31.229
You don't have
to pay me anything.

20:31.422 --> 20:33.714
Oh. Then why do this?

20:33.775 --> 20:36.292
Well, you were going to get
free rent<i> and</i> a free envelope,

20:36.352 --> 20:37.977
but now you just get free rent.

20:38.071 --> 20:39.462
You blew it.

20:39.480 --> 20:41.146
Felix,
do we have something to say?

20:41.241 --> 20:43.056
Sorry I locked you in a closet

20:43.117 --> 20:44.742
and that you
totally freaked out.

20:44.893 --> 20:46.410
It's okay. Sorta.

20:46.603 --> 20:48.895
It's a shame we didn't get
to do our duet, Mr. Fisch.

20:48.915 --> 20:50.639
Is it? I guess it is.

20:50.700 --> 20:53.309
Lin, I'm actually kind of
worried about the basement.

20:53.369 --> 20:55.068
Maybe we should go look at it.

20:55.129 --> 20:56.495
A five, six, seven, eight!
