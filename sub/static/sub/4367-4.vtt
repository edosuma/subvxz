00:02.368 --> 00:03.925
You are being watched.

00:04.596 --> 00:06.784
The government has a secret system...

00:07.019 --> 00:08.096
a machine...

00:08.274 --> 00:10.966
that spies on you every hour of every day.

00:11.617 --> 00:13.843
I designed the machine
to detect acts of terror,

00:13.960 --> 00:15.300
but it sees everything...

00:15.494 --> 00:18.602
violent crimes involving ordinary people.

00:18.604 --> 00:22.206
The government considers
these people irrelevant.

00:22.208 --> 00:23.974
We don't.

00:23.976 --> 00:28.879
Hunted by the authorities,
we work in secret.

00:28.881 --> 00:30.681
You will never find us.

00:30.683 --> 00:32.817
But victim or perpetrator,

00:32.819 --> 00:35.920
if your number's up, we'll find you.

00:45.097 --> 00:49.133
Back in the day, people
understood things like respect,

00:49.135 --> 00:50.434
loyalty, honor.

00:50.436 --> 00:51.903
Those days are gone.

00:51.905 --> 00:53.170
So what do you want to do?

00:53.172 --> 00:56.941
Only one thing to do.
Take care of it.

01:01.446 --> 01:04.248
Have you located our quarry,
Mr. Reese?

01:04.250 --> 01:05.316
I have.

01:05.318 --> 01:07.018
At a place called Grand.

01:07.020 --> 01:08.486
Good choice.

01:08.488 --> 01:10.254
You know it?

01:10.256 --> 01:11.816
Haven't been back since they renovated,

01:11.817 --> 01:13.691
but the old Grand served one mean rib eye.

01:13.693 --> 01:16.894
So our guy has expensive taste,

01:16.896 --> 01:18.563
The man he works for certainly does.

01:18.565 --> 01:21.265
George Massey owns
several local establishments,

01:21.267 --> 01:24.068
but he's better known for his
less reputable enterprises,

01:24.070 --> 01:28.606
including loan sharking,
money laundering, extortion.

01:28.608 --> 01:31.976
Good to know the Irish mob
is still alive and kicking.

01:31.978 --> 01:34.218
I suppose if the city's
gonna have organized criminals,

01:34.219 --> 01:35.499
they should at least be diverse.

01:35.500 --> 01:39.233
Massey runs his businesses
with his son Eddie.

01:39.235 --> 01:40.634
And our guy?

01:40.636 --> 01:42.370
Riley Cavanaugh.

01:42.372 --> 01:45.556
No living family and no
education past high school.

01:45.558 --> 01:47.174
The only job he seems to have held

01:47.176 --> 01:49.944
is driving a truck
for a company owned by Massey.

01:49.946 --> 01:51.786
Appears to have been
an associate of Massey's

01:51.787 --> 01:53.314
for several years.

01:53.316 --> 01:54.949
What kind of associate?

01:54.951 --> 01:57.201
The kind that gets
the attention of the machine.

01:57.203 --> 01:58.286
I'm going in.

01:58.288 --> 02:00.054
- Something happening?
- Yeah.

02:00.056 --> 02:01.922
Lunch.

02:18.657 --> 02:21.726
Did you talk to the owner
of that new bar on 35th?

02:21.728 --> 02:24.011
We were gonna drop by later today.

02:24.013 --> 02:28.282
Good. Let me know
if I need to get involved.

02:34.039 --> 02:35.206
What's this?

02:35.208 --> 02:36.674
Trying to take my job?

02:36.676 --> 02:39.060
Sorry.
You looked busy.

02:39.062 --> 02:40.878
Your server will be with you shortly.

02:40.880 --> 02:42.713
Unless you want his job too.

02:42.715 --> 02:45.966
Yours will do for now.

02:49.254 --> 02:51.472
How's your lunch, George?
Everything okay?

02:51.474 --> 02:53.374
Al, it's great.

02:53.376 --> 02:55.496
I can't even remember
what the old place looks like.

02:55.497 --> 02:57.228
Neighborhood's changed.

02:57.230 --> 02:59.397
Have to keep up
with the times, as they say.

02:59.399 --> 03:03.351
Yeah, some things do change.

03:03.353 --> 03:06.487
But some don't.

03:06.489 --> 03:08.906
For instance, you and me.

03:08.908 --> 03:11.325
I know I'm behind, George,
but just give me...

03:11.327 --> 03:12.576
Behind?

03:12.578 --> 03:14.178
You're a little more than behind.

03:14.180 --> 03:17.923
We were down for three months
with the remodel,

03:17.924 --> 03:20.084
and people aren't going out
to eat like they used to.

03:20.086 --> 03:22.370
Yeah, I know. I know.

03:22.372 --> 03:24.672
Well, here's the thing.

03:24.674 --> 03:28.559
You can spend all your money
on your fancy fixtures

03:28.561 --> 03:30.161
and your wallpaper

03:30.163 --> 03:33.581
as long as you keep paper in my pocket.

03:33.583 --> 03:35.716
Understand?

03:35.718 --> 03:38.636
Yeah.

03:38.638 --> 03:39.887
Yeah, I understand.

03:39.889 --> 03:41.639
Good.

03:41.641 --> 03:45.443
Because, next time...

03:45.445 --> 03:49.947
I'm not gonna be the one
who's stopping by.

03:51.199 --> 03:55.436
It'll be me.

03:55.438 --> 03:58.956
And I won't be here for lunch.

04:03.462 --> 04:06.630
Looks like our associate
is Massey's enforcer.

04:06.632 --> 04:09.783
And by "enforcer,"
you mean he's our perpetrator?

04:09.785 --> 04:11.619
Annie, hang on.

04:11.621 --> 04:14.405
Come here.
Hey.

04:14.407 --> 04:17.408
What's going on?
You don't say hello anymore?

04:17.410 --> 04:19.510
Sorry, George, I'm kind of busy.

04:19.512 --> 04:22.930
You know, I've been thinking
a lot about you lately.

04:22.932 --> 04:25.065
Yeah? Should I be
flattered or scared?

04:25.067 --> 04:26.834
Come on.

04:26.836 --> 04:28.236
I just wanna know how you're doing.

04:28.237 --> 04:29.737
You know?

04:29.739 --> 04:31.805
Whether or not you've found somebody

04:31.807 --> 04:35.776
to fend off those cold nights yet.

04:35.778 --> 04:38.312
Why?
You offering, George?

04:38.314 --> 04:39.830
'Cause now I'm really scared.

04:39.832 --> 04:43.501
Hey, I'm a married man.

04:43.503 --> 04:45.619
You gotta be more respectful.

04:45.621 --> 04:49.256
And I'm the widow of one of
your guys, in case you forgot.

04:49.258 --> 04:53.961
- So back at ya, George.
- Hey.

04:53.963 --> 04:55.930
What happened to Sean was tragic,

04:55.932 --> 04:59.049
but he's the one that made his
bed with the Russians, not me.

04:59.051 --> 05:00.451
I thought he worked for you George.

05:00.452 --> 05:03.771
Yeah, but his debts were his own.

05:03.773 --> 05:07.608
He was a degenerate gambler,
and it got him killed.

05:07.610 --> 05:11.178
You had better learn
to accept that, Annie.

05:11.180 --> 05:13.254
I do, but I also remember

05:13.255 --> 05:15.015
that Sean was the sweetest guy
in the world

05:15.017 --> 05:17.985
until the day he started working for you.

05:17.987 --> 05:22.957
So degenerate or not,
I'll always miss him.

05:22.959 --> 05:27.244
I wonder who's gonna miss you
when you're gone, George.

05:30.131 --> 05:32.967
You take care, Annie.

05:38.924 --> 05:41.725
Let's get the hell outta this dump.

05:41.727 --> 05:44.361
And who on earth was that young lady?

05:44.363 --> 05:45.763
The hostess.

05:45.765 --> 05:47.364
Got some brass.

05:47.366 --> 05:51.602
Just served George more than his lunch.

06:10.138 --> 06:13.407
Give me five minutes.

06:13.409 --> 06:15.376
They're cautious.

06:15.378 --> 06:17.044
They check their phones at the bar

06:17.046 --> 06:18.562
before talking business in the back.

06:18.564 --> 06:21.215
Actually, that may help us.

06:21.217 --> 06:24.952
If the phones are close together,

06:24.954 --> 06:28.455
I can use Riley's as a host...

06:28.457 --> 06:31.392
to get up on the other ones.

06:31.394 --> 06:33.994
Still need ears in that back office.

06:33.996 --> 06:35.779
What do you suggest?

06:35.781 --> 06:37.815
Improvising.

06:41.870 --> 06:43.571
Hey, what the hell is wrong with you?

06:43.573 --> 06:46.407
Right now, that look on your face.

06:46.409 --> 06:48.442
Nothing another drink won't fix.

06:48.444 --> 06:51.495
Get him outta here.

06:58.153 --> 06:59.803
Were you successful,
Mr. Reese?

06:59.805 --> 07:02.556
I'll know in a minute.

07:11.032 --> 07:14.602
This thing with Annie.

07:14.604 --> 07:16.737
- Forget about it, pop.
- Forget about it?

07:16.739 --> 07:18.972
You heard the way she spoke to me today.

07:18.974 --> 07:23.510
Bringing up that idiot husband
of hers in public.

07:23.512 --> 07:26.980
Used to be people had some respect.

07:26.982 --> 07:31.235
Part of that was knowing
when to keep your mouth shut.

07:31.237 --> 07:35.873
Maybe I should pay her a visit.

07:35.875 --> 07:37.958
Why?

07:37.960 --> 07:41.662
You got some special way
of getting through to her?

07:41.664 --> 07:44.131
I can tell her to drop the subject.

07:44.133 --> 07:46.350
Does she look like the type
who would drop anything?

07:46.352 --> 07:48.886
I don't know, pop,
Riley can be pretty persuasive.

07:52.692 --> 07:54.558
Okay.

07:54.560 --> 07:56.527
You go up there.
See her tonight.

07:56.529 --> 07:58.178
Okay.

07:58.180 --> 08:01.015
But not to shut her up.

08:01.017 --> 08:03.484
To make her disappear.

08:07.088 --> 08:09.456
I don't know, boss.

08:09.458 --> 08:14.078
Don't know?

08:14.080 --> 08:15.462
Don't know what?

08:15.464 --> 08:21.201
She's the widow of one of the boys.

08:21.203 --> 08:22.603
Might hurt morale.

08:22.605 --> 08:26.123
Morale?

08:26.125 --> 08:29.810
Whose morale are you worried about?

08:31.429 --> 08:33.764
Theirs?

08:33.765 --> 08:38.235
Or mine?

08:38.236 --> 08:41.488
Okay, boss.

08:41.490 --> 08:43.222
I'll take care of it.

08:43.225 --> 08:46.660
Okay.
See that you do.

08:46.662 --> 08:51.081
Take Eddie.

08:51.083 --> 08:52.833
Use the Pearl.

08:52.835 --> 08:56.470
Don't leave a trace.

08:56.472 --> 08:57.855
Finch, our enforcer

08:57.856 --> 08:59.656
is going after the girl
from the restaurant.

08:59.658 --> 09:01.625
The hostess?
Annie?

09:01.627 --> 09:05.129
She just became his next target,

09:05.131 --> 09:09.099
and he just became mine.

09:19.060 --> 09:20.944
Mr. Reese, I assume
I don't need to remind you

09:20.946 --> 09:22.830
these are dangerous men you're following.

09:22.832 --> 09:25.649
I've taken all precautions, Finch.

09:25.651 --> 09:28.452
You find anything on Annie?

09:28.454 --> 09:31.405
Yes, her name is Anne Delaney,
born and raised in Brooklyn.

09:31.407 --> 09:34.274
She was widowed nine months ago
when her husband Sean Delaney

09:34.276 --> 09:36.543
was found shot to death in Brighton Beach.

09:36.545 --> 09:38.128
That was Russian territory then

09:38.130 --> 09:40.564
before Elias took it all over.

09:40.566 --> 09:43.267
Not the place to be
if you're one of George's crew.

09:43.269 --> 09:45.769
You have an address for her?

09:45.771 --> 09:47.905
1424 East 39th.

09:47.907 --> 09:51.141
You're headed in that direction.

09:58.850 --> 10:00.651
So how do you want to do this?

10:00.653 --> 10:03.487
Quietly.

10:03.489 --> 10:05.656
Yeah, but how?
The old man said no trace.

10:05.658 --> 10:07.357
I'll handle it.

10:07.359 --> 10:09.799
You just keep an eye out and be
ready to help with the body.

10:09.800 --> 10:11.812
Are you hearing this,
Mr. Reese?

10:11.814 --> 10:13.831
Don't worry, Finch.

10:13.833 --> 10:18.252
I'll make sure they don't
get anywhere near her.

10:21.257 --> 10:22.589
Someone's calling Riley.

10:22.591 --> 10:25.793
No, it's George calling Eddie.

10:25.795 --> 10:28.962
- Yeah?
- Don't talk, just listen.

10:28.964 --> 10:30.798
Before you do that thing tonight,

10:30.800 --> 10:34.334
I want you to handle that other
business that we talked about.

10:34.336 --> 10:38.355
- Riley.
- You sure?

10:38.357 --> 10:40.524
You heard him today, Eddie.

10:40.526 --> 10:43.861
I gave him a chance to come
clean, he didn't take it.

10:43.863 --> 10:45.846
I can't trust him anymore.

10:45.848 --> 10:47.064
So he goes.

10:47.066 --> 10:51.034
Then the girl.

10:51.036 --> 10:53.954
Now can you handle this, or do I need to?

10:53.956 --> 10:56.356
No, no.
I got it.

10:56.358 --> 10:59.359
Good.
Call me when it's done.

11:05.417 --> 11:06.884
What's up?

11:06.886 --> 11:08.869
Nothing, the old man was just checking in.

11:08.871 --> 11:12.005
You know how he gets.

11:16.544 --> 11:19.813
Yeah, I do.

11:19.815 --> 11:21.582
We may have this one wrong, Finch.

11:21.584 --> 11:23.767
Riley might be the victim after all,

11:23.769 --> 11:25.102
but I think I'm too late.

11:25.104 --> 11:26.553
Too late?

11:26.555 --> 11:30.941
What do you mean,
Mr. Reese?

11:40.168 --> 11:41.735
What was that?

11:41.737 --> 11:45.122
Hang on, Finch.

12:05.277 --> 12:09.429
Mr. Reese,
he's calling Annie.

12:14.036 --> 12:14.985
Hello?

12:14.987 --> 12:16.904
- Hey, it's me.
- Hey.

12:16.906 --> 12:20.123
You okay?
You sound stressed.

12:20.125 --> 12:22.042
I'm fine.
Annie, listen.

12:22.044 --> 12:25.045
Something's gone wrong.

12:25.047 --> 12:29.499
George... he must have
found out about you and me.

12:30.451 --> 12:33.003
What?
Are you sure?

12:33.005 --> 12:34.438
Yeah. Pretty sure.

12:34.440 --> 12:36.723
I just had to kill Eddie.

12:36.725 --> 12:38.141
My God.

12:38.143 --> 12:40.143
Annie, it's gonna be all right.

12:40.145 --> 12:42.065
All right? You just
killed George Massey's son.

12:42.066 --> 12:43.096
Just listen, Annie.

12:43.098 --> 12:45.933
Please, just go to our place and wait.

12:45.935 --> 12:48.869
I'm gonna make a quick stop,
and then I'll be there.

12:48.871 --> 12:53.407
Okay?

12:53.409 --> 12:55.826
Annie.

12:55.828 --> 12:58.078
Okay.

13:00.248 --> 13:01.648
I love you.

13:01.650 --> 13:05.585
I love you too.

13:11.709 --> 13:13.260
Did I just hear that right?

13:13.262 --> 13:14.661
Our enforcer is in love

13:14.663 --> 13:17.097
with the woman he was sent to kill?

13:17.099 --> 13:18.832
Yeah.

13:18.834 --> 13:23.553
Which means we now have
two people to protect, Finch.

13:41.888 --> 13:44.557
Mr. Reese, has Riley
met up with Annie yet?

13:44.559 --> 13:45.992
Not yet.

13:45.994 --> 13:48.144
There must be some other way
to locate her.

13:48.146 --> 13:50.226
Maybe, but George will be
gunning for both of them.

13:50.227 --> 13:53.816
Yes, but Annie is the innocent
victim in this equation.

13:53.818 --> 13:57.019
Are you saying we should
protect Annie but not Riley?

13:57.021 --> 13:59.381
I'm just saying you might
not want to put yourself and her

13:59.382 --> 14:00.656
at risk for a man like that.

14:00.658 --> 14:02.275
He's a killer,
Mr. Reese.

14:02.277 --> 14:04.010
So was I, Finch.

14:04.012 --> 14:05.745
I think there's a distinction to be made.

14:05.747 --> 14:07.485
Not as much as you think.

14:07.486 --> 14:09.406
Well, he's a desperate man
running out of time,

14:09.407 --> 14:11.167
and George won't be
the only one after him.

14:11.169 --> 14:13.369
The police will be looking
for Eddie's killer as well.

14:13.370 --> 14:16.255
Guess it's time to put
our two detectives to work.

14:22.680 --> 14:24.913
- Carter.
- Morning, Detective.

14:24.915 --> 14:27.800
No, not until I've had my morning coffee.

14:27.802 --> 14:30.603
- You can take it with you.
- Take it where?

14:30.605 --> 14:32.104
I'm sending you the location.

14:32.106 --> 14:33.922
Why?
What's there?

14:33.924 --> 14:35.808
Shows his face, we'll take him out.

14:35.810 --> 14:36.809
Absolutely.

14:36.811 --> 14:39.945
A body.

14:42.617 --> 14:44.450
Finch, George's men

14:44.452 --> 14:47.036
are already at Riley's apartment building.

14:47.038 --> 14:48.904
He must know about Eddie.

14:48.906 --> 14:51.307
Which means they'll be
looking for Annie too.

14:51.309 --> 14:54.660
We need to make sure
she's not at her place.

14:54.662 --> 14:56.545
Finch?

14:56.547 --> 14:59.632
I can call Fusco.

14:59.634 --> 15:01.584
No, that's all right.

15:01.586 --> 15:05.921
Yes, I'll call you when I get there.

15:13.898 --> 15:16.649
It's okay.

15:16.651 --> 15:21.203
I'll be fine.

15:22.607 --> 15:24.774
See if you can put a rush on those plates.

15:24.776 --> 15:26.575
Sure.

15:26.577 --> 15:27.673
If they're in the system,

15:27.674 --> 15:28.994
I want to know as soon as you do.

15:28.996 --> 15:32.198
- All right.
- You got it.

15:32.200 --> 15:33.966
Detective Szymanski.

15:33.968 --> 15:36.168
It's good to see you back on active duty.

15:36.170 --> 15:38.788
You know, I thought
about dying, but I realized

15:38.790 --> 15:41.040
I couldn't afford it
on a detective's salary.

15:41.042 --> 15:42.575
What are you doing here?

15:42.577 --> 15:44.176
Heard there was a body.

15:44.178 --> 15:45.961
Already?

15:45.963 --> 15:47.563
Homicide task force doesn't mess around.

15:47.564 --> 15:49.998
- What you got?
- It's a car wreck.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.501
The deceased is Eddie Massey.

15:52.503 --> 15:54.470
Not good.

15:54.472 --> 15:56.372
I hear his dad's got a temper.

15:56.374 --> 15:58.190
Eddie have too much to drink?

15:58.192 --> 15:59.692
Under the influence, yes,

15:59.694 --> 16:02.027
but not alcohol, hollow points.

16:02.029 --> 16:04.346
Two in the side, close range.

16:04.348 --> 16:06.198
Well, his weapon's still holstered.

16:06.200 --> 16:08.067
Shooter must have taken him by surprise.

16:08.069 --> 16:10.853
- His passenger?
- Sounds right, airbag deployed.

16:10.855 --> 16:12.988
Only goes off if someone's riding shotgun,

16:12.990 --> 16:15.691
or in this case,
.38 caliber.

16:15.693 --> 16:17.159
Well, if the shooter was in the car,

16:17.161 --> 16:20.496
Eddie probably knew who he was.

16:20.498 --> 16:23.299
Let's see what we got here.

16:25.368 --> 16:27.688
Received a call from a blocked
number early this morning,

16:27.689 --> 16:29.872
and then after that, several missed calls.

16:29.874 --> 16:32.308
- Somebody's looking for him.
- Probably his dad.

16:32.310 --> 16:36.829
Yup.

16:48.241 --> 16:51.911
Annie's already gone.

16:51.913 --> 16:55.581
Anything to tell us where she went?

16:55.583 --> 16:56.832
Finch?

16:56.834 --> 17:00.703
I'm looking.
I'm looking.

17:12.915 --> 17:16.352
Any luck?

17:16.354 --> 17:19.555
Nothing yet.

17:19.557 --> 17:21.824
If they've got a secret meeting place,

17:21.826 --> 17:26.145
she's hidden it well.

17:28.531 --> 17:31.767
Of course.

17:31.769 --> 17:33.652
Well, just don't
get caught hanging around.

17:33.654 --> 17:34.937
I don't intend to.

17:34.939 --> 17:38.607
Did you reach our detectives?

17:38.609 --> 17:41.527
I got them both on the job.

17:41.529 --> 17:45.714
Detective Szymanski.

17:45.716 --> 17:48.250
George, this is Detective Carter.

17:48.252 --> 17:51.470
I heard about the incident
you had a few months ago.

17:51.472 --> 17:54.924
Feared we might have lost you.

17:54.926 --> 17:58.961
George, I'm afraid I've got some bad news.

17:58.963 --> 18:00.513
Eddie's dead.

18:00.515 --> 18:02.231
I'm aware.

18:02.233 --> 18:06.569
You don't seem too upset about the news.

18:06.571 --> 18:10.639
We all deal with grief
differently, Detective.

18:10.641 --> 18:13.308
How are you dealing with yours?

18:13.310 --> 18:18.414
Find my son's killer, and you'll see.

18:18.416 --> 18:21.316
George, when was
the last time you saw Eddie?

18:21.318 --> 18:22.501
Yesterday.

18:22.503 --> 18:24.787
We had lunch, came back here.

18:24.789 --> 18:26.789
Any idea what he was doing
out so late last night

18:26.790 --> 18:27.673
or with whom?

18:27.675 --> 18:28.991
Couldn't say.

18:28.993 --> 18:29.992
He received a call

18:29.994 --> 18:31.010
shortly before the crash.

18:31.012 --> 18:32.177
Was it from you?

18:32.179 --> 18:33.540
You know, instead of badgering me,

18:33.541 --> 18:35.381
shouldn't you be out there
trying to find out

18:35.383 --> 18:38.851
who killed my son?

18:38.853 --> 18:40.002
Where's your crew?

18:40.004 --> 18:43.055
My what?

18:43.057 --> 18:44.497
Well, your son was just gunned down,

18:44.498 --> 18:45.474
maybe by a rival gang.

18:45.476 --> 18:47.109
I'd expect you to have some protection.

18:47.111 --> 18:50.195
- I can take care of myself.
- I'm sure.

18:50.197 --> 18:52.531
Or you already know who the shooter is,

18:52.533 --> 18:54.116
and your boys are out looking for him.

18:54.118 --> 18:55.784
Rest assured, Detective,

18:55.786 --> 18:57.903
if I find the person responsible

18:57.905 --> 19:01.040
for Eddie's murder,

19:01.042 --> 19:02.441
you'll never know.

19:12.420 --> 19:15.504
Yep.

19:21.479 --> 19:24.730
Merry Christmas.

19:24.732 --> 19:27.733
God bless you.

19:27.735 --> 19:30.052
Check in with everybody.
They'll show up.

19:30.054 --> 19:34.640
When they do, I want to know.

19:35.825 --> 19:37.385
Mr. Reese, I may
have found something.

19:37.386 --> 19:38.527
That's good, Finch,

19:38.529 --> 19:40.596
because I may have lost something.

19:40.598 --> 19:42.438
Annie was very careful
not to leave any clues

19:42.439 --> 19:45.918
as to her and Riley's
meeting place, but...

19:47.120 --> 19:48.537
maybe there is one.

19:48.539 --> 19:51.757
Her laptop wallpaper is a view of the city

19:51.759 --> 19:53.292
from a photo she took.

19:53.294 --> 19:54.710
Okay.

19:54.712 --> 19:56.295
By measuring the alignment

19:56.297 --> 19:58.881
and relative size of the key
buildings in the photo,

19:58.883 --> 20:01.350
I was able to determine
the geographical coordinates

20:01.352 --> 20:03.118
of the spot where it was taken,

20:03.120 --> 20:06.455
approximately 50 feet above sea level.

20:06.457 --> 20:09.024
Great, now does any of that
voodoo produce an address?

20:09.026 --> 20:12.111
460 Eckford.
And it's trigonometry.

20:12.113 --> 20:14.863
How do we know that has
anything to do with Riley?

20:14.865 --> 20:16.198
Because...

20:17.568 --> 20:19.601
460 Eckford is his first known address.

20:19.603 --> 20:20.936
It's where he grew up.

20:20.938 --> 20:22.454
So he brought her home.

20:22.456 --> 20:26.041
It's only four blocks away from you.

20:29.445 --> 20:30.746
How did George find out?

20:30.748 --> 20:32.414
It doesn't matter, we gotta go.

20:32.416 --> 20:34.536
I gotta get you on a train
and as far away from here

20:34.537 --> 20:35.297
as possible, Annie.

20:35.298 --> 20:36.785
- Me?
- Yes.

20:36.787 --> 20:38.467
You mean us.
I'm not leaving without you.

20:38.468 --> 20:39.304
Annie.

20:39.306 --> 20:40.746
You said you wanted out of the city.

20:40.747 --> 20:42.307
You said we'd find some wide open place

20:42.308 --> 20:43.628
out west and start over together.

20:43.629 --> 20:44.549
They're looking for me.

20:44.550 --> 20:45.928
It's too dangerous.

20:45.930 --> 20:48.664
I won't do this without you.
I can't.

20:48.666 --> 20:50.599
Yes, you can, Annie.
Now listen, okay?

20:50.601 --> 20:52.685
- I'm gonna... Annie.
- No, no! You listen to me.

20:52.687 --> 20:55.404
After Sean died,
you came by the restaurant.

20:55.406 --> 20:58.006
You gave me your number, and you
said if I ever needed anything,

20:58.007 --> 21:00.075
to just call, you remember?

21:00.077 --> 21:02.077
Yeah.

21:02.079 --> 21:04.580
And then my water heater broke.

21:04.582 --> 21:06.832
Just exploded, water everywhere.

21:06.834 --> 21:09.618
Yeah, and you called.

21:09.620 --> 21:11.020
I didn't think you'd even remember,

21:11.021 --> 21:13.172
but you said you'd be right there,

21:13.174 --> 21:16.099
and you were.

21:16.100 --> 21:17.500
Of course you were next to useless,

21:17.501 --> 21:19.301
splashing around in water
up to your ankles.

21:19.303 --> 21:20.583
Loosening this, tightening that.

21:20.584 --> 21:21.964
Hey.

21:21.966 --> 21:25.350
But you came.
You kept your promise,

21:25.352 --> 21:27.186
just like you did every time after that.

21:27.188 --> 21:28.170
You were there.

21:28.172 --> 21:30.856
I love that.

21:30.858 --> 21:36.311
Knowing I can count on you,
I need to know that.

21:36.313 --> 21:41.617
So I don't care who knows
or how dangerous it is.

21:41.619 --> 21:45.854
I'm not going anywhere
without you, not ever.

21:45.856 --> 21:48.490
Okay?

21:48.492 --> 21:52.127
- Okay?
- Okay.

21:52.129 --> 21:54.246
- Let's get going.
- Okay.

22:01.871 --> 22:04.506
- What's in there?
- Savings.

22:04.508 --> 22:07.760
It's enough money to get us
wherever we need to go.

22:07.762 --> 22:09.228
No.

22:09.230 --> 22:11.146
No, no, no, no, no, no!

22:16.553 --> 22:19.621
Not what you were expecting?

22:19.623 --> 22:21.590
George.

22:21.592 --> 22:23.776
You didn't know I knew about your stash,

22:23.778 --> 22:26.728
or the fact that you were
sticking it to Sean's old lady?

22:26.730 --> 22:27.996
What do you want?

22:27.998 --> 22:29.281
How about my son back?

22:29.283 --> 22:31.033
I'm sorry, George,

22:31.035 --> 22:33.068
but Eddie didn't give me a choice.

22:33.070 --> 22:36.822
Well, you can apologize to him
yourself in a moment or two.

22:38.092 --> 22:39.741
Get down!

22:39.743 --> 22:41.409
- Mr. Reese?
- Come on!

23:00.763 --> 23:02.614
Finch, George's men tried to ambush them.

23:02.616 --> 23:04.066
Riley's with Annie on the run.

23:04.068 --> 23:07.236
Do be careful,
Mr. Reese.

23:16.914 --> 23:19.164
Thanks for the tip, Finch.

23:25.588 --> 23:27.739
Mr. Reese, is everything
all right?

23:27.741 --> 23:29.308
I'll survive.

23:29.310 --> 23:32.477
- What about Annie and Riley?
- I'm not sure.

23:44.558 --> 23:47.091
Prints taken off Eddie's car
belong to Riley Cavanaugh,

23:47.093 --> 23:49.144
one of Massey's top enforcers.

23:49.146 --> 23:51.062
No wonder George wasn't sweating.

23:51.064 --> 23:52.424
He was looking for one of his own.

23:52.425 --> 23:53.782
One of the building tenants

23:53.784 --> 23:56.934
said she saw a guy matching
Cavanaugh's description,

23:56.936 --> 23:59.571
leaving the building with
a woman, could be a hostage.

23:59.573 --> 24:01.105
What do we know about him?

24:01.107 --> 24:03.124
He's a suspect
in three mob-related hits

24:03.126 --> 24:05.210
over the past two years.
He's a stone-cold killer.

24:06.446 --> 24:08.263
We gotta find him, take him down.

24:08.265 --> 24:09.914
Szymanski.

24:09.916 --> 24:12.500
Yeah, we got it.
Okay.

24:18.341 --> 24:21.559
That's the stuff.

24:27.132 --> 24:31.186
- Happy Birthday.
- How did you know?

24:33.155 --> 24:36.307
Reconsidering your decision
to protect Riley?

24:36.309 --> 24:39.310
No, just thinking
I should grab a new shirt.

24:39.312 --> 24:41.212
He shot you, John.

24:41.214 --> 24:45.950
It wasn't personal.

24:45.952 --> 24:48.286
Maybe we should focus
on the more pressing issue

24:48.288 --> 24:49.821
of finding them.

24:52.125 --> 24:53.491
Yes, Detective?

24:53.493 --> 24:55.213
Your partner,
Mr. Tall, Dark, and Fearsome

24:55.214 --> 24:57.929
- really got Massey steamed.
- Meaning what?

24:57.931 --> 25:00.011
Meaning he put a bounty
on Cavanaugh and the broad.

25:00.012 --> 25:02.634
- How much?
- A million.

25:02.636 --> 25:06.871
Keep me informed.

25:06.873 --> 25:08.839
If Detective Fusco is correct,

25:08.841 --> 25:11.526
Annie and Riley will have
every hired gun in the city

25:11.528 --> 25:12.861
looking for them.

25:12.863 --> 25:14.195
George is too small of a fish

25:14.197 --> 25:15.730
to pull off a move like this.

25:15.732 --> 25:18.849
He'll need to get
the word out city-wide.

25:18.851 --> 25:20.285
And who would he reach out to

25:20.287 --> 25:25.290
for that kind of help?

25:25.292 --> 25:29.127
See what you can do.

25:29.129 --> 25:30.862
Where are you going?

25:30.864 --> 25:33.197
George took the money Riley
was gonna use to start over.

25:33.199 --> 25:35.083
He'll need to get more
before they leave town.

25:35.085 --> 25:37.585
I think I know where they might go.

25:43.727 --> 25:45.376
Hello, Carter.

25:45.378 --> 25:48.479
Riley Cavanaugh?
That's who you're protecting?

25:48.481 --> 25:50.398
He's protecting an innocent woman.

25:50.400 --> 25:51.983
Why didn't you tell me this earlier?

25:51.985 --> 25:54.652
Because I needed you
to question George Massey.

25:54.654 --> 25:56.854
You mean distract him.

25:56.856 --> 25:58.806
- What about the woman?
- Annie Delaney.

25:58.808 --> 26:00.992
Right now, Riley's her best protection.

26:00.994 --> 26:04.279
Yeah, well, Szymanski's also
looking to take this guy down.

26:04.281 --> 26:06.397
Which is exactly why I
need you to stay with him,

26:06.399 --> 26:10.735
to make sure that doesn't happen.

26:10.737 --> 26:13.288
You want me to derail
a homicide investigation.

26:13.290 --> 26:14.739
Anything else?

26:14.741 --> 26:16.925
I'll be in touch.

26:22.914 --> 26:24.265
This is all I have on hand.

26:24.267 --> 26:25.787
I can go to the bank if you need more.

26:25.788 --> 26:27.268
No, Al.
This is great.

26:27.270 --> 26:28.987
I'll pay you back every cent, I promise.

26:28.989 --> 26:30.269
Annie, some men came by earlier,

26:30.270 --> 26:31.522
George's men, asking for you.

26:31.524 --> 26:32.774
What did you say?

26:32.776 --> 26:35.026
The truth.
I hadn't seen you.

26:35.028 --> 26:37.762
I don't know how to thank you, Al,

26:37.764 --> 26:41.616
everything you've done for me.

26:41.618 --> 26:45.603
Annie, are you sure you're okay?

26:45.605 --> 26:48.656
Yeah, don't worry.

26:48.658 --> 26:51.576
And thank you.

26:55.297 --> 26:57.382
Finch, someone's trying
to collect the bounty

26:57.384 --> 27:00.551
on Riley and Annie.

27:00.553 --> 27:02.754
We gotta go!

27:14.850 --> 27:16.234
Wrong way, guys.

27:24.860 --> 27:27.412
Finch, I found Riley and Annie,

27:27.414 --> 27:29.313
and so have the bounty hunters.

27:29.315 --> 27:30.865
Any luck with our old friend?

27:30.867 --> 27:32.850
I'll have an answer for you shortly.

27:32.852 --> 27:34.535
Open the gate.

27:40.342 --> 27:42.927
You guys can go.

27:51.020 --> 27:52.820
So I'm afraid you have me
at a disadvantage,

27:52.821 --> 27:54.806
Mr. Crane,
is it?

27:54.808 --> 27:56.474
You obviously know something about me,

27:56.476 --> 27:58.843
but I know nothing about you.

27:58.845 --> 28:01.345
The man I work with saved the life

28:01.347 --> 28:04.749
of someone close to you, Charlie Burton.

28:08.588 --> 28:11.239
So you're the boss.

28:12.558 --> 28:16.127
I suppose I,

28:16.129 --> 28:20.882
I... should thank you
for saving my life,

28:20.884 --> 28:23.868
as well as my current accommodations.

28:23.870 --> 28:27.872
I trust you're keeping
yourself busy, Mr. Elias.

28:27.874 --> 28:29.173
Certainly your control

28:29.175 --> 28:30.591
of the city's criminal enterprises

28:30.593 --> 28:32.543
appears undiminished.

28:32.545 --> 28:35.229
Well, being stripped of all possessions

28:35.231 --> 28:38.516
eliminates a lot of distractions.

28:38.518 --> 28:40.735
I've got time to read,
to think, to play chess.

28:40.737 --> 28:44.221
Though, you know,
finding a worthy opponent

28:44.223 --> 28:48.760
has been a little challenging.

28:48.762 --> 28:51.729
What brings you to see me?

28:51.731 --> 28:53.781
We need help with a minor boss

28:53.783 --> 28:58.402
whose organization may not be
under your control yet.

28:58.404 --> 28:59.771
George Massey.

28:59.773 --> 29:02.573
I heard about his son.

29:02.575 --> 29:05.710
- Our friend John's handiwork?
- No, one of his own men.

29:05.712 --> 29:09.030
Fallen under our protection now.

29:09.032 --> 29:11.081
Massey's put
a million-dollar bounty on him

29:11.083 --> 29:12.082
and the woman he's with.

29:12.084 --> 29:15.887
Yes.
So flashy.

29:15.889 --> 29:18.806
Relics like Massey, they never learn.

29:18.808 --> 29:21.692
There's so much more
to be gained by staying

29:21.694 --> 29:25.262
out of the limelight, in the background.

29:25.264 --> 29:27.598
Those are the people
you have to watch out for.

29:27.600 --> 29:30.601
Indeed.

29:30.603 --> 29:33.538
We thought he might reach out
to such a man

29:33.540 --> 29:35.072
for help.

29:35.074 --> 29:37.575
If so, we hoped we could convince you

29:37.577 --> 29:42.530
to withhold your assistance.

29:42.532 --> 29:47.869
So you want me to shut down
Massey's little hunting party?

29:47.871 --> 29:52.723
Well, I suppose I do owe you
something for saving my life.

29:52.725 --> 29:57.428
Even so, everything does come with a cost.

29:57.430 --> 30:01.015
I assumed there would be.

30:01.017 --> 30:04.802
What is it you want?

30:04.804 --> 30:10.441
Well, as I said,
I have no need of possessions.

30:19.869 --> 30:22.620
Will be leaving from track 35
in approximately five minutes.

30:22.622 --> 30:24.922
I'm gonna go get some tickets, okay?

30:24.924 --> 30:29.293
- I'll go with you.
- No. Just stay here.

30:29.295 --> 30:32.329
- Mr. Reese?
- Go ahead, Finch.

30:32.331 --> 30:35.082
I believe our bounty hunter
problem has been neutralized.

30:35.084 --> 30:36.934
You actually got Elias to help us out?

30:36.936 --> 30:39.687
Yes, he's made
George's bounty forbidden fruit.

30:39.689 --> 30:42.089
Anyone going after it
will have to answer to him.

30:42.091 --> 30:45.259
As a reminder,
please do not leave your bags...

30:51.818 --> 30:53.818
Looks like someone
didn't get the message, Finch,

30:53.819 --> 30:56.237
and he's still gonna try to collect.

31:10.219 --> 31:11.319
Over there!

31:13.890 --> 31:15.539
Mr. Reese,
what's happening?

31:15.541 --> 31:17.592
One of the bounty hunters
is going after Riley.

31:17.594 --> 31:18.843
Did he get to him?

31:18.845 --> 31:21.512
No, the bounty hunter took Annie.

31:26.985 --> 31:28.436
She's gone.

31:42.009 --> 31:44.394
Follow me!

31:47.065 --> 31:48.448
Mr. Reese,
where are you?

31:48.450 --> 31:50.349
Following Riley.
Police spotted him.

31:50.351 --> 31:52.785
But I thought you said
that Annie had been taken!

31:52.787 --> 31:54.070
I did.

31:54.072 --> 31:56.239
Then why are you wasting time on Riley?

31:56.241 --> 31:57.640
He's a killer.
He's just...

31:57.642 --> 31:59.575
bad code.

31:59.577 --> 32:01.794
- Bad what?
- Forget it.

32:01.796 --> 32:04.881
Everything Riley's done so far
is to protect Annie.

32:04.883 --> 32:07.383
The bounty hunter still
has to deliver her to George,

32:07.385 --> 32:10.303
so that's where Riley's headed.

32:10.305 --> 32:12.588
Yes, Detective?

32:12.590 --> 32:13.873
Yeah, Massey's on the move.

32:13.875 --> 32:15.374
Do you know where he was headed?

32:15.376 --> 32:17.677
No, he must have slipped out the back.

32:17.679 --> 32:20.696
Okay, call me if he returns.

32:41.919 --> 32:43.503
Who the hell are you?

32:43.505 --> 32:45.421
Someone who knows what you're up against.

32:45.423 --> 32:47.673
Yeah?
What do you know?

32:47.675 --> 32:50.626
I know you shot Eddie to save Annie.

32:50.628 --> 32:52.411
And I know you've been protecting her

32:52.413 --> 32:55.398
since her husband was killed.

32:55.400 --> 32:59.585
Russians, right?

32:59.587 --> 33:00.586
That's right.

33:00.588 --> 33:01.854
Strange they'd kill him

33:01.856 --> 33:03.336
when he still owed them so much money

33:03.337 --> 33:05.257
and then leave his body
in their own territory.

33:05.258 --> 33:06.759
It's very strange,

33:06.761 --> 33:10.530
unless maybe the Russians
didn't kill Sean.

33:10.532 --> 33:12.815
Maybe it was someone else,

33:12.817 --> 33:16.152
someone who wanted to make it
look like they did.

33:18.773 --> 33:22.792
A professional.
Someone like you.

33:28.882 --> 33:32.218
Sean was skimming
to pay back the Russians.

33:34.972 --> 33:37.557
George caught him and had him whacked.

33:37.559 --> 33:40.059
George had him killed,

33:40.061 --> 33:43.312
but the hit...
it was you.

33:53.857 --> 33:57.810
After Sean, George had me
keep tabs on Annie.

33:57.812 --> 34:00.913
He had a thing for her.

34:00.915 --> 34:03.583
He also wanted to make sure she
didn't ask too many questions.

34:03.585 --> 34:06.953
But you fell for her instead,

34:06.955 --> 34:08.337
and George found out.

34:08.339 --> 34:09.989
Annie doesn't deserve any of this.

34:09.991 --> 34:12.507
She just wants to get away
from here and start over.

34:12.510 --> 34:14.927
But she doesn't know about Sean.

34:14.929 --> 34:18.214
Do you really think
you can run away from that?

34:18.216 --> 34:20.299
No.

34:20.301 --> 34:23.186
I know what I am.

34:23.188 --> 34:25.438
But I also know that she's the best thing

34:25.440 --> 34:27.857
that's ever happened to me,

34:27.859 --> 34:31.277
and I will do whatever
I gotta do to save her.

34:41.855 --> 34:45.357
Well, if you go charging in
at George half-cocked,

34:45.359 --> 34:48.494
you'll be dead before you
can even do her any good.

34:52.250 --> 34:54.366
Come on, we need to move.

35:00.874 --> 35:04.727
Come on.

35:04.729 --> 35:08.097
It's a dead end.

35:08.099 --> 35:10.149
What now?

35:10.151 --> 35:12.151
We consider our options.

35:12.153 --> 35:14.570
Shooting at cops isn't one of them.

35:14.572 --> 35:17.723
You got a better idea, let's hear it.

35:17.725 --> 35:19.492
Excuse me.

35:19.494 --> 35:21.661
- Yes.
- Carter.

35:21.663 --> 35:23.395
How's it going, Detective?

35:23.397 --> 35:25.331
Szymanski's got a dragnet
out for your hit man.

35:25.333 --> 35:27.700
I suggest you steer clear for a while.

35:27.702 --> 35:29.342
Well, that's gonna be a little difficult.

35:29.343 --> 35:30.870
Don't tell me you're with him.

35:30.872 --> 35:33.339
Okay, I won't, but I still need your help.

35:33.341 --> 35:35.791
John, this guy killed Eddie Massey.

35:35.793 --> 35:38.261
Eddie was gonna kill him
and an innocent woman.

35:38.263 --> 35:41.180
Well, I'm sure the DA will
take that into consideration.

35:41.182 --> 35:43.248
This isn't about helping Riley,

35:43.250 --> 35:45.250
it's about saving Annie.

35:45.252 --> 35:47.436
Look, if I'm wrong...

35:47.438 --> 35:52.257
I'll turn him in to you myself.

35:59.049 --> 36:00.983
I got a tip!

36:00.985 --> 36:03.769
One of my CIs saw Cavanaugh
over near 43rd and 10th.

36:03.771 --> 36:05.171
- Call it in. Come on.
- Let's go.

36:05.173 --> 36:06.573
We got a sighting at 43rd and 10th.

36:06.574 --> 36:10.442
You got a detective in your pocket?

36:10.444 --> 36:12.662
More like on my back.

36:12.664 --> 36:15.214
Suspect reported near 43rd and 10th.

36:19.787 --> 36:21.954
Let's go.

36:21.956 --> 36:24.256
Finch, I've got Riley.
We're going to get Annie.

36:24.258 --> 36:26.225
Well, you won't find her at George's pub.

36:26.227 --> 36:28.293
Detective Fusco said he left in a hurry.

36:28.295 --> 36:33.298
Where would George take Annie?

36:33.300 --> 36:35.017
- The Pearl.
- The what?

36:35.019 --> 36:38.154
The Emerald Pearl's
a nightclub that George owned.

36:38.156 --> 36:42.358
It went under, but he kept it
for... for other business.

36:42.360 --> 36:45.544
Like making bodies disappear.

36:45.546 --> 36:46.912
You know this place?

36:46.914 --> 36:50.099
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

37:07.210 --> 37:08.977
What about her boyfriend?

37:08.979 --> 37:12.014
Last I saw, he was running for the door.

37:12.016 --> 37:15.134
Why am I not surprised?

37:15.136 --> 37:16.735
That's okay.

37:16.737 --> 37:19.321
I'm gonna catch up
with that coward soon enough.

37:19.323 --> 37:22.908
So I suppose I'll be taking my money now.

37:22.910 --> 37:24.910
The million was for the both of them.

37:24.912 --> 37:27.846
I'll settle for half,

37:27.848 --> 37:32.251
unless you think that's unreasonable.

37:32.253 --> 37:36.672
What the hell, I'm in a good mood.

37:36.674 --> 37:40.509
Corey, get this guy his money.

37:42.679 --> 37:45.247
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

37:45.249 --> 37:48.934
Bringing your boss a present.

37:48.936 --> 37:53.922
I believe I'm due a reward.

37:53.924 --> 37:57.342
You know that none of this
needed to happen, right?

37:57.344 --> 37:59.344
I wanted to help you, Annie.

37:59.346 --> 38:00.696
And what did I get?

38:00.698 --> 38:03.115
Gratitude?
No.

38:03.117 --> 38:05.317
Insults!

38:05.319 --> 38:08.203
Blame for Sean.

38:08.205 --> 38:12.875
To tell the truth,
you were right on that score.

38:14.377 --> 38:19.047
You see, Sean was not only
a degenerate gambler,

38:19.049 --> 38:22.367
he was also a thief.

38:22.369 --> 38:24.303
I gave him what he deserved.

38:24.305 --> 38:27.306
And you call Riley a coward.

38:27.308 --> 38:30.125
Riley.
Yeah.

38:30.127 --> 38:33.461
Did Riley ever tell you...?

38:33.463 --> 38:37.065
No, of course not.

38:37.067 --> 38:38.267
Tell me what?

38:38.269 --> 38:42.538
What really happened to Sean.

38:42.540 --> 38:46.008
Let her go, George.

38:46.010 --> 38:49.144
Well, look at that.

38:49.146 --> 38:52.331
Anybody moves, I'm shooting you first.

38:52.333 --> 38:56.168
Hey, good to see you, kid.

38:56.170 --> 38:59.705
Yeah, you know,
you just saved me 500 grand.

38:59.707 --> 39:01.823
Are you okay, Annie?

39:01.825 --> 39:03.342
She's fine.

39:03.344 --> 39:06.261
We were just having a little
conversation about Sean.

39:06.263 --> 39:07.846
Let her go, George.

39:07.848 --> 39:11.767
- Don't.
- He can't shoot both of us.

39:11.769 --> 39:14.720
He won't have to.

39:32.740 --> 39:34.689
Take Annie, go
for the kitchen, I'll cover you.

39:34.691 --> 39:36.191
No!
You're closer.

39:36.193 --> 39:39.745
Get her out of here.

39:42.333 --> 39:45.801
Go!
Take care of Annie!

39:49.506 --> 39:52.057
- We have to move.
- I'm not leaving without Riley.

39:52.059 --> 39:54.542
Annie, go.

39:54.544 --> 39:55.877
Go, it's okay.

39:55.879 --> 39:57.279
I will be right there.

40:00.484 --> 40:02.851
Go!

40:17.117 --> 40:20.285
I never should have sent Eddie.

40:20.287 --> 40:22.621
I should have killed you myself.

40:22.623 --> 40:26.375
She was right, you know.

40:26.377 --> 40:30.579
No one's gonna miss either one of us.

40:40.056 --> 40:42.024
Riley?

40:42.026 --> 40:43.976
- We can't leave him.
- I'm not.

40:43.978 --> 40:46.761
Get her out of here.

41:40.667 --> 41:44.119
Annie, Riley had this on him.

41:44.121 --> 41:48.340
Just the one?

41:48.342 --> 41:50.692
So he wasn't coming after all.

41:50.694 --> 41:52.260
He knew you'd always be looking

41:52.262 --> 41:54.012
over your shoulder if he did.

41:54.014 --> 41:56.014
I was fooling myself
to think I could change him.

41:56.015 --> 41:57.182
But you did.

41:57.184 --> 41:59.634
You gave him the strength to walk away

41:59.636 --> 42:01.053
from the only life he knew,

42:01.055 --> 42:03.388
to be better.

42:03.390 --> 42:09.111
He said you were the best thing
that ever happened to him.

42:09.113 --> 42:11.697
Thank you.

42:11.699 --> 42:15.650
Good luck.

42:27.748 --> 42:32.718
Earlier, what did you mean
when you said, "bad code"?

42:32.720 --> 42:36.171
It means a flawed design.

42:36.173 --> 42:38.423
The term applies to machines,
not to people.
