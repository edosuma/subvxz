02:40.418 --> 02:41.643
Motherfucker!

02:54.599 --> 02:56.199
I just got rid of the last.

02:56.309 --> 02:57.701
Thank fuckin' Christ.

02:57.810 --> 02:59.411
I drove up to Connecticut.

02:59.520 --> 03:01.747
Good. The rump roast
went in down the shore.

03:01.856 --> 03:04.499
So the barbecue over in
Sheepshead Bay... that still a go?

03:04.609 --> 03:07.336
You know I'm not really sure
where the big guy left that.

03:26.005 --> 03:29.524
This way, sweetheart. There's something
I need to get straight between us.

03:32.887 --> 03:35.697
Seriously, you look
beautiful tonight.

04:00.123 --> 04:01.556
Yeah.

04:01.749 --> 04:03.975
It's done. Listen.

04:06.462 --> 04:08.855
Gee, sounds like
a real weenie roast.

04:08.965 --> 04:11.608
Hey, your friend the Shah
was walkin' in when it happened.

04:11.718 --> 04:14.403
Him and some skifusa got
blown back on their keisters.

04:17.223 --> 04:20.617
And last, transfer of the deed
to Jamba Juice.

04:24.063 --> 04:26.498
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

04:30.069 --> 04:32.337
I'll meet you out front.

04:34.907 --> 04:37.342
Listen, I just wanted
to apologize.

04:37.827 --> 04:39.970
That night...

04:40.079 --> 04:42.514
it's just I make it
a policy not to mix business...

04:42.582 --> 04:44.558
No apology necessary, seriously.

04:44.667 --> 04:47.561
Good, 'cause the truth is
I haven't been able to forget about you

04:47.670 --> 04:51.106
and it ain't like
I haven't been tryin'.

04:51.215 --> 04:55.527
So, you free for dinner?
Maybe?

04:55.636 --> 04:57.696
Thanks, but I think I'll pass.

04:57.805 --> 04:59.781
Congratulations
on the sale, though.

05:04.979 --> 05:08.165
"Morning Sunshine,"
Benjamin Moore.

05:08.274 --> 05:11.251
And we can do the borders
with the Disney characters.

05:12.945 --> 05:15.213
Makes me nervous, this stuff.

05:15.281 --> 05:17.841
We should wait to decorate
till after the baby's born.

05:17.950 --> 05:20.927
Again with the superstitions?

05:21.037 --> 05:24.097
Remember the penguin movie,
how you cried?

05:24.207 --> 05:25.640
You sit on an egg for months,

05:25.750 --> 05:28.560
one little thing goes wrong,
you're left with nothing.

05:30.588 --> 05:33.231
Honey, I'm not Adrianna.

05:33.299 --> 05:36.485
I'm healthy.
Our baby's healthy.

05:36.594 --> 05:39.237
Stop worrying
and enjoy this time, okay?

05:39.305 --> 05:42.407
I am. Let's just stop countin'
the chickens.

05:42.475 --> 05:45.994
Any anesthesiologist, dial 5248.

06:01.661 --> 06:03.929
Workin' man get off okay?

06:04.038 --> 06:05.805
He was gone
by the time I got up.

06:05.915 --> 06:09.017
Used to be he wasn't
home by the time you got up.

06:13.381 --> 06:15.398
What's the matter?

06:16.801 --> 06:20.320
Liz La Cerva tried
to commit suicide. Pills.

06:21.222 --> 06:22.489
What'd she do that for?

06:22.598 --> 06:25.617
Apparently she got a letter for Ade
from the Salvation Army.

06:25.726 --> 06:28.286
- Ade's homeless?
- She made a donation every year

06:28.396 --> 06:30.247
to feed the homeless
on Thanksgiving.

06:30.356 --> 06:32.958
The letter set
Liz off, evidently.

06:33.025 --> 06:36.086
Look, I gotta say I commiserate
with the woman, but...

06:36.195 --> 06:37.796
She thinks her daughter is dead.

06:39.031 --> 06:42.092
I told you I had another dream
about Ade in Paris.

06:42.201 --> 06:45.428
A French policeman told me
she was dead and I had to tell her.

06:45.538 --> 06:47.305
I know, Carm.
Pepe Le Pew...

06:47.415 --> 06:49.641
Doesn't change the fact
that Adrianna is missing.

06:49.750 --> 06:52.310
It also doesn't change
the fact that her mother's a bitter lush

06:52.378 --> 06:54.312
- who can't accept reality.
- What reality?

06:54.380 --> 06:57.774
That her daughter couldn't stand her
so she moved away.

06:57.884 --> 06:59.651
That's what you
say to me two weeks

06:59.719 --> 07:01.987
after our own daughter
moves away to California.

07:02.054 --> 07:05.782
Oh come on, will you stop?
It's a different situation entirely.

07:05.892 --> 07:08.827
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
It's just...

07:08.936 --> 07:10.453
it's just everything
all at once.

07:10.563 --> 07:12.205
What everything?

07:12.315 --> 07:15.959
The holidays are coming
and my spec house has gone to shit.

07:16.068 --> 07:18.169
Well, A.J.'s got a job.
He's doing better.

07:20.031 --> 07:21.715
You raised two gorgeous kids.

07:21.824 --> 07:23.341
You got a husband
that loves you.

07:23.409 --> 07:25.385
You made us a beautiful home.

07:26.746 --> 07:29.514
Doesn't that count
for something?

07:32.084 --> 07:35.061
Come on.

07:37.673 --> 07:40.108
Not exactly a Thanksgiving Day
classic here, Ed...

07:42.178 --> 07:44.112
The fuck?
Come on, cut it out.

07:44.222 --> 07:46.781
He's already talkin'
like a real construction worker.

07:46.891 --> 07:49.868
Yeah, funny. See how you like
working out in the cold.

07:51.771 --> 07:54.164
Go check on the bird.

07:54.273 --> 07:56.541
Bring back some onion dip too.

08:04.784 --> 08:07.719
So how's your bird these days?

08:07.828 --> 08:09.471
What the fuck
are you talkin' about?

08:09.580 --> 08:13.266
Come on, clandestine
phone calls...

08:13.376 --> 08:15.018
I know you got a new goomar.

08:15.127 --> 08:17.771
- What can I say, huh?
- With a pregnant wife at home.

08:17.880 --> 08:19.439
Your timing is
fuckin' priceless.

08:19.549 --> 08:22.400
Playground's closed.
A man has his needs.

08:22.510 --> 08:24.569
Good point. When Carmela had
her spec house,

08:24.679 --> 08:27.072
I can't tell you how many nights
I had to fend for myself

08:27.181 --> 08:28.948
while she was out lookin'
at bathroom fixtures.

08:29.058 --> 08:31.576
So this new one... how come
you don't bring her around?

08:31.686 --> 08:34.788
Honestly I would but...

08:34.897 --> 08:37.289
between us, she's black.

08:37.400 --> 08:39.458
- Oh!
- You're bangin' a shine?

08:39.568 --> 08:42.419
She's hot too.
Classy.

08:42.530 --> 08:44.089
Not that it
would matter to Paulie.

08:44.198 --> 08:46.257
I'd still have to listen
to all his racial bullshit.

08:46.325 --> 08:49.678
Yeah.
She would feel it too.

09:00.923 --> 09:03.525
Hey, Uncle Paulie.

09:08.389 --> 09:10.615
The fuck you doin'?

09:16.355 --> 09:19.624
There's my girl.
Come here. Gimme that cheek.

09:21.277 --> 09:23.420
I got your check.

09:23.529 --> 09:25.880
She a doll or what?
Blanca.

09:27.533 --> 09:29.300
Hi. I'm Anthony.

09:29.994 --> 09:32.512
Yeah. I just did
your paperwork.

09:33.414 --> 09:36.224
- You live in Jersey?
- Hello.

09:36.334 --> 09:38.101
My urologist.
I gotta take this.

09:38.210 --> 09:39.644
Soprano!

10:16.248 --> 10:19.726
I would've cleaned up
if you gave me a minute.

10:19.835 --> 10:21.478
You started it.

10:27.843 --> 10:31.529
Seriously, I'm sorry
it's such a pigsty.

10:33.474 --> 10:36.493
I just work a lot and I'm a pig.

10:37.853 --> 10:39.412
Gonna get a tree in here?

10:39.522 --> 10:42.290
I come from Hanukkah people,
but it doesn't do a lot for me.

10:44.443 --> 10:46.878
So Christmas Eve's
just another day to you?

10:46.946 --> 10:49.547
Actually, we usually go to some
incredibly shitty movie.

10:49.657 --> 10:51.049
There's nothin' else
to choose from.

10:51.158 --> 10:52.884
Makes me worried
about my project.

10:52.952 --> 10:56.805
- You ruined my dress.
- Save it.

10:56.914 --> 10:59.057
Like Monica Lewinsky.

10:59.166 --> 11:01.726
Show your friends
how hard you made me come.

11:01.836 --> 11:03.853
Mmm.

11:09.635 --> 11:11.069
What are we doing here, huh?

11:11.137 --> 11:14.364
I don't know.

11:14.473 --> 11:16.699
Can't stop thinkin'
about fucking you all the time.

11:23.858 --> 11:27.877
How can you even like a person
who sleeps with a married guy?

11:27.987 --> 11:29.712
Can we not talk about it?

11:29.822 --> 11:32.632
I rushed in with her.
I thought I wanted it.

11:32.742 --> 11:34.801
You do.

11:34.910 --> 11:37.595
And you're not
giving it a chance.

11:37.705 --> 11:39.597
You'll see eventually
you'll want kids.

11:40.666 --> 11:41.933
It'll be good.

11:42.001 --> 11:44.769
I don't want a family with her.

11:44.837 --> 11:46.479
She's got no idea who I am.

11:49.216 --> 11:51.442
She "doesn't understand you"?

12:03.272 --> 12:05.707
As we know, Phil asked me
to arrange this meeting

12:05.816 --> 12:07.208
after the fire in his wire room.

12:07.318 --> 12:09.961
Correction.
You asked me to fuckin' attend.

12:10.029 --> 12:12.797
- I agreed.
- Fair enough.

12:12.865 --> 12:14.591
Now I won't call it
a sit-down because

12:14.700 --> 12:17.260
of the inclement
negative implications.

12:17.369 --> 12:20.805
Let's think of it as...
a meeting of minds.

12:20.915 --> 12:23.516
Now for whatever reason,
certain incidents

12:23.626 --> 12:27.937
have expired lately that in addition
to being dangerous

12:28.047 --> 12:30.857
could have an adverse impact
on our respective bottom lines.

12:30.966 --> 12:35.028
I know Vito's bottom was impacted
if that's what you're referring to.

12:35.137 --> 12:36.988
Call him what you will, but you're
talkin' about one of my captains.

12:37.056 --> 12:40.116
Captain?
The Good Ship Lollipop, right?

12:40.226 --> 12:42.201
- Phil, please.
- Please, my ass.

12:42.311 --> 12:44.120
The man was a fuckin' disgrace.

12:44.230 --> 12:45.830
Well, before he came
out of the closet

12:45.898 --> 12:47.582
he worked for me.

12:47.691 --> 12:49.042
And he put
a lot of money in my pocket.

12:49.151 --> 12:50.376
And yours too.

12:50.486 --> 12:53.171
Talk about earners?
How about Fat Dom Gamiello?

12:55.115 --> 12:56.507
- What about him?
- He's MIA.

12:56.617 --> 12:58.843
A lot of people are concerned
for his well-being.

12:58.953 --> 13:00.803
So what the fuck
would I know about that?

13:00.913 --> 13:04.015
Well, as coincidence would have it,
he was last seen in New Jersey.

13:04.083 --> 13:06.684
So was the Hindenburg.
Maybe you wanna look into that too.

13:06.794 --> 13:08.519
Tony, please.
Phil.

13:08.629 --> 13:10.855
We're getting off point.

13:10.965 --> 13:13.524
I grew up in this, guys.

13:13.592 --> 13:15.693
And I just lost
my friend, Rusty,

13:15.803 --> 13:19.530
and for reasons
I will discern in time, believe me.

13:19.640 --> 13:23.076
If there's one thing
my father taught me it's this...

13:23.185 --> 13:26.704
a pint of blood costs more
than a gallon of gold.

13:28.774 --> 13:31.209
My business,
all of our businesses...

13:31.277 --> 13:33.544
this infighting's costing money.

13:33.612 --> 13:35.505
I'm willing to move forward,

13:35.614 --> 13:39.008
let the past be bygones.

13:39.118 --> 13:41.386
- Fine with me.
- A wise decision

13:41.495 --> 13:43.054
on both your parts.

13:43.122 --> 13:44.639
Now what I'd love
to see is a truce.

13:44.748 --> 13:46.724
Wipe the slate clean.

13:46.792 --> 13:51.562
The no-shows, the wire room, Vito...
put it all behind us.

13:51.630 --> 13:53.064
Yeah.

13:54.466 --> 13:56.359
Your brother Billy,
whatever happened there...

13:56.468 --> 13:58.277
- All right then.
- "Whatever happened there?"

13:58.387 --> 14:00.279
- The shooting.
- "Whatever happened there?"

14:00.347 --> 14:03.491
- God rest his soul, huh?
- I'll tell you what fuckin' happened.

14:03.601 --> 14:04.951
This piece of shit's cousin

14:05.060 --> 14:06.536
- put six bullets in the kid...
- Calm down, Phil.

14:06.645 --> 14:08.788
Without any
provocation whatsoever!

14:08.898 --> 14:10.581
- My cousin's dead.
- Fuck you!

14:10.649 --> 14:13.042
Phil, we were making headway here.
I didn't mean to say...

14:13.152 --> 14:15.753
Fuck what you meant, cocksucker!

14:15.863 --> 14:17.463
Come on.

14:22.620 --> 14:24.470
Jesus Christ, Carmine.
What the fuck?

14:24.580 --> 14:27.015
Why would you possibly
bring that up?

14:30.377 --> 14:32.603
He's holdin' the board,
looking the other way.

14:32.713 --> 14:34.605
So the nail gun goes off, bam!

14:34.715 --> 14:36.274
Right through the dude's cheek.

14:36.342 --> 14:39.444
Oh, fuck.

15:13.754 --> 15:15.480
- Passaic.
- What?

15:15.589 --> 15:17.940
Where I live.
You asked me.

15:18.050 --> 15:19.817
Right.

15:19.885 --> 15:24.155
Why you ask me that?
You gonna come over, take me on a date?

15:24.723 --> 15:26.365
Yeah, absolutely.

15:27.059 --> 15:29.452
I got a son, Hector.

15:29.561 --> 15:30.953
He's three.

15:31.063 --> 15:33.331
Ah, that's cool.

15:43.534 --> 15:45.802
You're gonna call me, right?

15:48.580 --> 15:50.389
Hey... there's
only six numbers.

15:50.499 --> 15:52.308
I left the last one off.

15:52.418 --> 15:55.436
You wanna find me,
you're gonna have to work for it.

16:02.720 --> 16:04.529
You have an
emergency call on two.

16:04.638 --> 16:07.490
Oh my God.
Pop?

16:07.599 --> 16:09.784
Guess who.

16:09.893 --> 16:12.411
- That's not funny.
- Had to get your attention.

16:12.521 --> 16:14.914
Well you had my attention. Now you're
wasting my time. I have to go.

16:15.024 --> 16:18.376
Hold on. You got a warehouse
listed on Panama

16:18.444 --> 16:21.671
that used to be a uniform supply.
What's the asking?

16:21.780 --> 16:24.215
Three and a quarter.
Can I go now?

16:24.283 --> 16:26.509
I was driving by.
I thought it had some potential.

16:26.618 --> 16:28.386
But it's really
9,400 square feet

16:28.454 --> 16:31.139
of leaky tarpaper roofs
and clotted galvanized plumbing

16:31.248 --> 16:32.723
and no foot traffic to speak of.

16:32.791 --> 16:34.892
Ease up on the hard sell there.

16:35.002 --> 16:36.561
I'm thinking...

16:36.628 --> 16:39.230
you get the seller to knock something
meaningful off the asking,

16:39.298 --> 16:41.399
I fix it, you flip it.

16:43.844 --> 16:46.571
Look, whatever happened, we did
make some money together, right?

16:48.599 --> 16:51.409
- You serious about this?
- Oh, you never do shit like that?

16:52.644 --> 16:54.579
I'll get back to you.

17:02.905 --> 17:04.755
I was up for anything.

17:04.823 --> 17:06.424
He signed the escrow papers

17:06.532 --> 17:08.925
and I'm not sure what happened

17:09.036 --> 17:11.929
but he... left.

17:11.997 --> 17:14.598
It was so fucking humiliating...

17:16.335 --> 17:19.979
and I was so worked up. I just
needed to smooth it out.

17:20.089 --> 17:22.356
So there's the Cristal.

17:25.176 --> 17:28.195
I mean it could've been
worse, given my history.

17:28.305 --> 17:30.281
It could've been junk.

17:30.390 --> 17:32.992
Julie, right?

17:33.102 --> 17:36.120
- Julianna.
- Christopher.

17:36.230 --> 17:38.080
I liked your share
in there, seriously.

17:38.190 --> 17:41.125
I'm glad...
or sorry I guess.

17:41.235 --> 17:43.961
Got a similar situation
with my job.

17:44.029 --> 17:46.464
I really get that rush
when it's working.

17:46.532 --> 17:49.133
I don't think I've ever heard you
share in there.

17:49.201 --> 17:50.760
Not a judgment, by the way.

17:50.869 --> 17:52.887
You learn as much from others.

17:52.996 --> 17:55.139
I split my time at NA too.

17:55.249 --> 17:56.974
Junk's another thing, huh?

17:57.084 --> 17:59.977
Tell me about it.

18:00.087 --> 18:04.315
- You look familiar.
- Pork store there, Satriale's.

18:05.050 --> 18:08.152
Oh, right.

18:09.555 --> 18:12.657
Wow, cool.
So I guess I'll see you.

18:12.724 --> 18:15.952
Or maybe next week, here.

18:16.061 --> 18:18.496
Wait. You wanna go
for coffee?

18:20.232 --> 18:23.376
Well... okay.

18:23.485 --> 18:26.379
Wanna follow me
to that dive on Sip and JFK?

18:49.803 --> 18:52.363
For some people,
depression is a form

18:52.431 --> 18:55.408
of forced introversion.

18:55.517 --> 18:57.910
And in Lincoln's case,
it was extremely painful.

18:58.020 --> 19:01.664
But it's out of that forced
introversion

19:01.773 --> 19:04.041
- that comes the Abraham Lincoln...
- Where you been?

19:04.109 --> 19:05.835
- Linda Merola's.
- Who's the successful president.

19:05.944 --> 19:08.421
I left you a message.
The annual Christmas toy drive.

19:08.530 --> 19:12.967
- How was it?
- It was nice. We gave an XBox.

19:13.076 --> 19:16.762
So, Stan Klimik was there.

19:16.872 --> 19:18.723
Ruth's husband?
He works for Kroll.

19:18.832 --> 19:20.266
The private eyes?

19:20.375 --> 19:22.059
He does their computers.

19:22.169 --> 19:23.936
Anyway, I was
telling him about Ade

19:24.046 --> 19:26.272
and he said we should
hire professionals

19:26.381 --> 19:28.816
- to track her down.
- Carm...

19:28.926 --> 19:30.484
It's not as expensive
as you might think, Tony.

19:30.594 --> 19:32.111
He gave me his card.

19:32.221 --> 19:35.323
Look, it's not about the money.

19:35.432 --> 19:38.868
Did you ever think that maybe it's
an intrusion into Ade's personal life?

19:38.977 --> 19:40.995
But what if she's
in trouble, Tony?

19:46.068 --> 19:47.752
Stan said they had
this case once...

19:47.861 --> 19:50.087
this guy ran out
on his child support.

19:50.197 --> 19:53.883
He was a hiking enthusiast,
missing 12 years

19:53.992 --> 19:57.595
and they tracked him down to a watering
station in the Mojave Desert.

20:05.712 --> 20:09.440
Carmela's spec house? I need you to go
lean on that building inspector.

20:09.508 --> 20:12.193
- Leave it alone, you said.
- Do it today, for all our sakes.

20:12.302 --> 20:15.154
My wife needs a career.

20:15.264 --> 20:17.907
Tony, hey.
Season's greetings.

20:18.016 --> 20:20.117
Good holidays
to your family, huh?

20:20.227 --> 20:22.620
Yeah, you too.

20:27.901 --> 20:29.627
Well, it's bigger
than I thought.

20:29.736 --> 20:32.546
I got close with a developer who thought
he could do apartments,

20:32.656 --> 20:35.383
some light retail, but we snagged
on some zoning issues.

20:36.785 --> 20:39.762
Let me worry about that.

20:39.871 --> 20:43.974
So who's this fiancé
you were telling me about?

20:44.042 --> 20:47.895
Jesus, what the fuck
do you want here?

20:50.090 --> 20:53.109
- Just move on, huh?
- I was confused, okay?

20:53.218 --> 20:54.985
- I'm not now.
- What a coincidence,

20:55.095 --> 20:57.822
'cause that's exactly
how I feel.

20:57.931 --> 21:00.908
Take all the time you need.
Just stick it in the lock box.

21:11.987 --> 21:14.130
It's only the latest draft.

21:14.239 --> 21:16.006
Guy who wrote it...
I met him at a meeting.

21:16.116 --> 21:17.842
JT Dolan, big user.

21:17.909 --> 21:20.594
You can tell.
It's relentless.

21:20.704 --> 21:23.013
Yeah, it's a work in progress.

21:23.081 --> 21:25.266
I didn't mean it like that.
There's a lot in it.

21:27.002 --> 21:30.146
Are you sure
about the title, "Cleaver"?

21:30.255 --> 21:31.981
The Jerry Mathers connection?

21:32.090 --> 21:34.358
Rules of success
for pictures like this?

21:34.426 --> 21:38.362
One-word titles...
"Saw," "Hostel," "Cleaver."

21:39.806 --> 21:42.533
But Michael... he knows
it's the boss right away?

21:43.852 --> 21:45.744
You might want to make
more of a mystery out of it.

21:45.854 --> 21:47.371
Maybe.

21:47.481 --> 21:50.416
This boss,
he's a really rough...

21:52.152 --> 21:54.211
is Anthony Soprano like that?

21:54.321 --> 21:57.047
He's just a jumping-off point
for the character.

22:00.619 --> 22:03.387
He's got some similarness.

22:03.455 --> 22:05.181
Like he thinks everything's his.

22:05.832 --> 22:07.600
But it's not.

22:11.254 --> 22:13.481
I can't get into it
but there are some rules.

22:13.590 --> 22:16.650
Thank you. Don't get into it.
I don't wanna know.

22:18.970 --> 22:21.572
It's just weird, you know?
Being where he's been.

22:21.640 --> 22:24.450
He hasn't been anywhere.

22:24.559 --> 22:26.118
Nothing happened.
I told you that.

22:26.228 --> 22:29.038
Don't matter.
He's been there in his mind.

22:29.147 --> 22:32.041
Ugh. Fine.

22:43.161 --> 22:46.263
You're right. Guy's got a lot more
on his mind than this.

22:47.999 --> 22:50.809
Like whether or not to have
that third sandwich.

23:06.143 --> 23:08.118
I'm not a fucking parking spot.

23:10.439 --> 23:12.373
Ow.

23:27.497 --> 23:29.723
Don't get me wrong,
I loved Dom more than anybody.

23:29.833 --> 23:32.309
My point is we don't know
if Tony was behind this.

23:32.377 --> 23:34.144
It was payback for Vito.

23:34.254 --> 23:36.313
So why the fuck did they blow up
the wire room?

23:39.718 --> 23:41.110
The balls on this prick.

23:41.219 --> 23:43.112
To blow up a store...
you call that balls?

23:43.221 --> 23:44.613
Balls is you look
a guy in the eye

23:44.723 --> 23:46.448
while you jam an ice pick
through his lung.

23:46.558 --> 23:48.826
I meant balls
as in "nerve," "gall."

23:48.935 --> 23:50.619
I know what the fuck you meant.

23:50.729 --> 23:53.497
Far as I'm concerned,
this is like 9-11.

23:53.565 --> 23:55.791
Tony wanted
our attention. Fine.

23:55.901 --> 23:59.295
He got our attention.
Now we wipe him off the planet.

23:59.404 --> 24:01.797
You know that fat cocksucker says
I look like the Shah of Iran?

24:01.907 --> 24:04.925
- Who does?
- Tony.

24:05.035 --> 24:07.344
- I never got that at all.
- Fat piece of shit.

24:07.412 --> 24:11.640
It's irrelevant, Phil.
But he's testin' you all the time.

24:11.750 --> 24:13.309
And you keep indulging him.

24:13.418 --> 24:15.519
You're right.

24:16.796 --> 24:21.692
But whack a boss?
I won't do that.

24:21.801 --> 24:23.861
- It's been done before.
- And it was wrong then.

24:23.970 --> 24:26.864
Eye for an eye then, huh?
Pick somebody over there.

24:33.396 --> 24:36.206
White trash motherfuckers
in Narcotics Anonymous...

24:36.274 --> 24:37.666
fucking "Jerry Springer Show."

24:37.776 --> 24:40.210
The fuck with
your whining tonight?

24:41.947 --> 24:45.716
Listen... been involved
with this girl.

24:45.784 --> 24:47.718
In there... that's
the place to share.

24:47.786 --> 24:51.263
It's complicated.

24:51.373 --> 24:54.767
Remember that real estate agent Tony
was dealing with? The Jewish one?

24:54.876 --> 24:57.561
Fuckin' A. He planted
the flag. I'd back off.

24:57.671 --> 24:59.063
No, he didn't do shit, she said.

24:59.172 --> 25:01.482
He wanted to and
then never pulled the trigger.

25:01.591 --> 25:03.525
Okay, it's touchy but okay.

25:03.635 --> 25:06.737
I don't know if it's okay but fuck him
and what he don't know, you know?

25:10.058 --> 25:11.950
So what's the problem?

25:12.060 --> 25:15.245
She's in recovery.
Junk.

25:15.355 --> 25:18.957
Her? Fuckin' movie
of the week.

25:19.067 --> 25:22.044
Listen to me.
That last run you went on,

25:22.153 --> 25:25.589
beginning with the feast? How hard you
had to work to get back from that?

25:26.324 --> 25:28.967
Civilians... their bosses
find out they slipped,

25:29.077 --> 25:30.594
they get a plane ticket
to Minnesota.

25:30.704 --> 25:33.430
Tony will fuckin' mulch his roses
with what's left of you.

25:33.498 --> 25:35.808
She's solid now.
Years sober.

25:35.917 --> 25:37.643
We fuckin' met at a meeting.

25:37.752 --> 25:40.938
- That never happens to me.
- That's all you got to say?

25:41.006 --> 25:42.815
Schools of thought...

25:42.924 --> 25:47.027
two of you together could be enabling.
Bad habits shared.

25:47.137 --> 25:48.946
But it's more like
she knows how bad it is.

25:49.055 --> 25:50.447
We watch out for each other.

25:50.557 --> 25:53.242
She wouldn't even
let me have Red Bull. Seriously.

25:53.351 --> 25:56.662
Well, that's the other school...
two are stronger than one.

25:56.771 --> 25:58.330
I know I'm different with her.

25:58.440 --> 26:02.292
Well, I guess we just
keep an eye on it.

26:02.360 --> 26:03.961
You fuckin' lucky cocksucker.

26:04.571 --> 26:08.048
- Another married man?
- I know.

26:08.158 --> 26:10.968
And it gets worse.
I think he's connected.

26:11.036 --> 26:12.970
To what?

26:13.079 --> 26:15.180
- The mafia.
- No...

26:15.290 --> 26:19.309
But... actually I know he is because
I was involved with his boss.

26:21.421 --> 26:23.147
You ever hear of
Anthony Soprano?

26:23.214 --> 26:26.316
I'm sorry, Jules. I don't even know
where to fucking start.

26:26.384 --> 26:28.444
I know, I know.

26:28.553 --> 26:30.988
The stupid thing is

26:31.056 --> 26:33.991
he's sweet.
He's good to me.

26:34.059 --> 26:36.326
I want you to listen
to this very carefully...

26:36.394 --> 26:39.830
I'm your sponsor. I'm not judging you.
I'm not disappointed.

26:39.898 --> 26:43.250
I am concerned and I'm here
to help you help yourself.

26:43.360 --> 26:46.253
Unlike you, I've lived
in North Jersey my whole life

26:46.363 --> 26:48.839
and those people
like his boss...

26:48.907 --> 26:52.301
they are sociopaths.
Murderers actually.

26:52.410 --> 26:56.638
I know, Ame, but I think you're getting
a little carried away.

26:56.748 --> 26:59.850
Don't hug me.
On top of everything I'm getting a cold.

27:01.711 --> 27:03.562
Cock...!

27:03.672 --> 27:05.856
Sucker motherfucker!

27:05.924 --> 27:07.775
You shit asshole!
I hate you!

27:07.884 --> 27:10.068
This man is so lame.

27:12.389 --> 27:14.615
Shit.

27:14.724 --> 27:17.951
- What's wrong?
- These assholes again.

27:18.061 --> 27:20.037
They wake up the baby.

27:25.110 --> 27:28.212
Shh! My baby's
sleeping.

27:28.321 --> 27:30.422
Why don't you come out here
and suck our dick?

27:30.532 --> 27:32.883
Hey, what's this asshole's
problem?

27:35.704 --> 27:38.472
My ex used to go down
and kick their asses, but...

27:38.581 --> 27:40.057
now they're back.

27:42.627 --> 27:45.979
Okay, papi.
It's all right.

27:48.383 --> 27:50.150
It's all right, baby.

27:54.055 --> 27:56.198
Shh.

27:58.476 --> 28:00.911
Fuckwads.

28:26.171 --> 28:29.815
Look, you guys move.
Go hang somewhere else,

28:29.924 --> 28:32.734
I'll give you this bike.
It's a Gary Fisher.

28:32.844 --> 28:36.113
It's only a year old.
My parents gave it to me last Christmas.

28:42.187 --> 28:44.329
All right.

29:07.337 --> 29:10.856
It doesn't bother you
that I'm younger than you are?

29:10.965 --> 29:14.651
You know who was born
on your birthday? Jesse Ventura.

29:14.719 --> 29:17.154
Who?

29:17.263 --> 29:20.157
He's a famous politician.
I looked it up.

29:20.266 --> 29:22.492
How do you know my birthday?

29:22.602 --> 29:26.830
I did your W-4, remember?
The withholding?

29:36.616 --> 29:38.675
You sure it don't
bother you I have a baby?

29:39.160 --> 29:41.678
No, I love kids.

29:46.918 --> 29:49.519
This is fuckin' ridiculous.
You're not goin' noplace.

29:49.587 --> 29:52.272
- I want to.
- We can watch a DVD.

29:52.382 --> 29:54.942
I got the 50 Cent movie
down in my trunk.

29:55.051 --> 29:56.568
They were giving it away
at the car wash.

29:58.429 --> 30:00.405
Don't talk.

30:01.683 --> 30:03.700
That's it.
You're fuckin' grounded.

30:03.768 --> 30:05.869
Lie down.

30:11.776 --> 30:14.044
I'm gonna go down the pharmacy,
get some Robitussin.

30:14.153 --> 30:17.881
No! It's got
dextromethorphan.

30:17.991 --> 30:21.760
What are you gonna do? Rip your
fuckin' lungs out? This is crazy.

30:21.870 --> 30:24.596
You certainly seem very anxious
to get cough medicine in here.

30:27.500 --> 30:28.934
I resent that.

30:36.050 --> 30:39.486
Fuck it! It's over the counter.
How much shit could be in it?

30:39.596 --> 30:42.072
Umh-um.

30:49.022 --> 30:52.124
Maybe you could get
some valerian tea.

30:52.233 --> 30:54.918
You put eight, nine,
10 tea bags in a cup.

30:56.988 --> 31:00.090
- Fuck's that gonna do?
- It's equal to like taking a Valium.

31:00.158 --> 31:03.343
- I didn't know that.
- Same chemical family.

31:05.204 --> 31:08.306
Gotta have some cough
suppressant value, right?

31:10.001 --> 31:12.102
Worst-case scenario,
it might help you sleep at least.

31:14.339 --> 31:17.274
What do you think?

31:17.342 --> 31:19.109
Valerian tea.

31:19.177 --> 31:20.986
You have to go to
the health food store.

31:32.690 --> 31:35.375
Jesus Christ, they didn't teach you
how to use a pair of pliers yet?

31:36.694 --> 31:38.837
Oh it smells
all Christmassy in here.

31:38.947 --> 31:40.797
Yeah.

31:42.408 --> 31:44.342
Come on.

31:45.703 --> 31:48.722
Oh, the Russos...
picture of their dogs.

31:48.831 --> 31:51.391
It's sad with no children.

31:59.050 --> 32:02.861
Oh my God!
The Building Department.

32:02.971 --> 32:05.363
They're repealing the stop-work
order on my spec house!

32:05.473 --> 32:07.407
"Construction
may begin immediately."

32:07.517 --> 32:11.078
Tony, is this you? This is the best
Christmas present I could ever get!

32:11.187 --> 32:14.664
Oh, I better return that vacuum
I got you then.

32:15.984 --> 32:18.043
So, Christmas Eve...
besides the shrimp,

32:18.152 --> 32:21.713
- I told DeSanto the cherrystones.
- Fine, good.

32:21.823 --> 32:24.174
You sure? 'cause last year
you said the cherrystones were chewy.

32:24.242 --> 32:25.801
The littlenecks then.

32:25.910 --> 32:30.055
Jesus! Ebenezer Scrooge
over here.

32:30.581 --> 32:33.809
So stop breakin' my balls
about clams. I don't feel good.

32:37.296 --> 32:39.940
The Soft Scrub,
lemon-scented.

32:43.261 --> 32:45.695
You're cool as a cucumber.

32:45.805 --> 32:47.614
Did I say I'm hot?

32:47.724 --> 32:50.492
I got a tightness
in my chest up by the esophagus.

32:50.601 --> 32:52.661
Well, you just had
a checkup, Phil.

32:53.896 --> 32:55.914
Yeah.

32:56.441 --> 32:58.125
Imagine the Christmas Marie

32:58.234 --> 33:00.252
and the kids'll be having
after all that with Vito?

33:00.361 --> 33:02.838
The DiBellas too.

33:02.947 --> 33:04.339
Catherine's stroke?

33:04.449 --> 33:06.550
Remember last year
at my mother's house?

33:06.617 --> 33:11.138
Francesca Spatafore did that beautiful
solo of "O Holy Night"?

33:11.247 --> 33:14.015
Vito accompanied her
on the piano?

33:15.168 --> 33:17.727
I gotta try and take a shit.

33:17.795 --> 33:20.814
Now, when one is having a heart attack,
the body releases proteins

33:20.923 --> 33:23.150
that act as markers
which we would detect in the blood.

33:23.259 --> 33:24.734
You don't show any, sir.

33:24.844 --> 33:26.695
- So, his heart is fine?
- Yep.

33:26.804 --> 33:28.488
Jesus Christ.

33:28.598 --> 33:31.533
Mr. Leotardo, some people
would pay millions for that diagnosis.

33:31.642 --> 33:34.536
- So what the hell's wrong with me?
- My guess is simple gas.

33:34.645 --> 33:36.204
I always say
he's full of hot air.

33:36.314 --> 33:37.873
Pharmacy's down the hall.

33:37.982 --> 33:41.376
They will give you some antacid.
Take care.

33:42.028 --> 33:43.461
Arrogant prick.

33:43.571 --> 33:46.798
Nervous Nellie.
That's what you are.

34:00.296 --> 34:01.688
I'm so sorry.

34:01.798 --> 34:03.523
This asshole Wall Street couple

34:03.633 --> 34:06.234
came back to look
at this loft space.

34:33.996 --> 34:37.139
Mmm.

35:01.607 --> 35:04.584
- I'm dyin'. My heart!
- Oh my God!

35:06.487 --> 35:08.630
Okay, we're here.
We're here.

35:08.739 --> 35:11.508
It's all right, it's all right.
It's okay. Don't worry about it.

35:11.617 --> 35:14.010
Help! My husband.

35:14.120 --> 35:15.512
- Phil!
- Crash cart!

35:15.621 --> 35:18.807
Can I get a crash cart?
Crash cart!

35:23.254 --> 35:26.356
Heh, I fucked a girl
wearing a Santa hat once.

35:26.465 --> 35:30.235
It was too distracting.
I kept losin' my hard-on.

35:30.344 --> 35:32.279
Hey Ton'.
Did you hear?

35:32.388 --> 35:35.573
Phil Leotardo took a heart attack,
a big one apparently.

35:35.683 --> 35:39.327
Ho! So there is
a Santa Claus.

35:39.437 --> 35:43.581
He's in Intensive Care over in
Brooklyn. Doesn't look too good.

35:43.691 --> 35:45.500
Sweetheart, drinks all around.

35:45.610 --> 35:49.379
And a club soda
for the messenger here.

35:49.447 --> 35:51.673
You're happy about this, T?

35:51.782 --> 35:54.551
Why not? He's a pain
in my balls.

35:54.660 --> 35:57.804
A manageable pain though, eh?
The devil you know...

35:57.914 --> 35:59.639
After the scene
at Little Carmine's?

36:03.252 --> 36:05.312
Corrado, don't you have nothing?

36:05.421 --> 36:07.230
You can make a hand turkey.

36:07.340 --> 36:10.066
For Christmas?
Fuckin' idiot.

36:13.012 --> 36:14.696
Visitor for
Mr. Soprano.

36:18.351 --> 36:20.952
Bobby!

36:27.610 --> 36:29.919
Any of you know
what "bacala" is?

36:29.987 --> 36:31.755
Of course you don't.

36:31.822 --> 36:33.882
Well, it's salted cod.

36:33.991 --> 36:36.343
We taught the world how to eat.

36:36.452 --> 36:39.471
Junior, sit.

36:45.670 --> 36:47.604
Happy holidays, huh?

36:47.672 --> 36:49.439
You smell the piss
in this place?

36:49.548 --> 36:51.608
I ain't gonna stay too long.

36:53.135 --> 36:55.111
Just to say you
should keep this.

36:55.221 --> 36:58.865
- What's that?
- You had Beppe drop it by, remember?

36:58.975 --> 37:01.785
Had a Post-it?
It said "Merry Christmas"?

37:03.854 --> 37:05.246
It's a gift.

37:05.356 --> 37:08.041
It's a little something
for you and Karen and the kids.

37:09.318 --> 37:10.960
It wouldn't be right.

37:11.028 --> 37:13.838
I mean, frankly I shouldn't be here
after what happened with Tony.

37:13.948 --> 37:16.091
He's still up on his cross, huh?

37:16.200 --> 37:18.927
Junior, you shot him.

37:19.036 --> 37:21.304
Yeah, well it's not that simple.

37:21.414 --> 37:23.473
I know a few things you don't.

37:23.582 --> 37:25.683
Like maybe I wasn't
acting alone.

37:25.793 --> 37:27.852
Junior, JFK was 40 years ago.

37:27.962 --> 37:30.313
That's all I'll say about that.

37:32.216 --> 37:34.317
You see that one over there?

37:34.385 --> 37:38.446
An attorney.
I'm mounting my case.

37:38.556 --> 37:41.491
Look, I should take off.

37:41.600 --> 37:43.326
You want a snack?
A soda?

37:43.436 --> 37:45.120
What the fuck?
You just got here.

37:46.564 --> 37:49.165
Happy holidays.

38:06.625 --> 38:08.435
Here.

38:08.544 --> 38:10.437
One hand washes the other.

38:10.546 --> 38:13.189
So the husband says,
"I wasn't talkin' to you."

38:35.905 --> 38:37.589
You know her?

38:37.698 --> 38:40.800
Oh that's right, you and her...

38:40.910 --> 38:43.386
- How'd that all go?
- I had to put her on the shelf.

38:46.123 --> 38:49.893
Yeah, she's a friend of Kaisha,
the black one I was tellin' you about.

38:52.421 --> 38:55.899
She was just now asking
what to get Kaisha for her birthday.

38:57.760 --> 38:59.903
What'd you tell her?

38:59.970 --> 39:01.905
Luther Vandross, a box set.

39:45.141 --> 39:47.283
Mmm.

39:48.936 --> 39:51.246
Mmm.

39:53.691 --> 39:55.291
You know what's interesting?

39:55.401 --> 39:58.002
Hmm?

39:58.112 --> 40:02.173
Us being able to use again,

40:02.283 --> 40:04.801
but integrating it
into our lives.

40:04.869 --> 40:07.512
Yeah.

40:07.621 --> 40:10.974
Work...

40:11.041 --> 40:12.976
socialize...

40:15.463 --> 40:19.148
but still having a mastery.

40:19.258 --> 40:21.609
Not easy.

40:21.719 --> 40:24.028
But interesting as shit.

40:38.068 --> 40:40.420
For one thing,
we don't use needles.

40:52.500 --> 40:54.851
I should probably tell
Tony we're fucking.

41:03.010 --> 41:05.320
What?

41:05.429 --> 41:07.697
We're not anymore.

41:07.806 --> 41:10.283
He's already hinky.

41:11.602 --> 41:13.953
He starts pokin' around,

41:14.063 --> 41:16.331
finds out we met in AA,

41:16.440 --> 41:19.250
he could suspect
I'm usin' again...

41:23.197 --> 41:24.297
Hmm.

41:25.157 --> 41:27.467
And ruin everything.

41:58.691 --> 42:00.083
There he is.

42:00.192 --> 42:01.542
Where the fuck you been?

42:01.652 --> 42:03.252
You hear that Phil
had surgery now?

42:03.362 --> 42:05.755
Turds in the aorta...
a medical first.

42:05.864 --> 42:07.590
Gotta see my chiropodist.

42:07.700 --> 42:09.676
T...

42:09.785 --> 42:11.928
there's something
I should tell you.

42:20.796 --> 42:22.605
- The real estate agent.
- Yeah?

42:22.715 --> 42:24.649
I've been bangin' her.

42:29.388 --> 42:32.073
See, I knew some shit
was goin' on.

42:34.143 --> 42:35.827
Why the fuck did you lie to me?

42:35.936 --> 42:38.162
I wasn't sure
how it ended with you two

42:38.272 --> 42:40.164
till you set me straight.

42:40.274 --> 42:42.583
Stupid, right?

42:42.693 --> 42:45.545
Point is I want
everything above boards

42:45.654 --> 42:48.423
as always between you and me.

42:48.532 --> 42:50.258
I don't give a fuck.

42:50.367 --> 42:53.136
Do what you want with her.

42:57.541 --> 42:59.600
- This is my reward.
- Your reward.

42:59.710 --> 43:01.144
I do not betray my wife.

43:01.253 --> 43:04.647
I go out of my way
not to have an affair with this woman,

43:04.757 --> 43:07.400
this very hot,

43:07.509 --> 43:10.528
very beautiful,
intelligent woman...

43:10.638 --> 43:13.865
'cause of the way Carmela
nursed me and cared for me.

43:13.974 --> 43:16.159
And my fuckin' turkey-neck
of a nephew

43:16.268 --> 43:17.827
winds up with his dick in there.

43:17.936 --> 43:19.787
A guy I gotta see every day.

43:21.106 --> 43:22.999
This is my reward.

43:23.108 --> 43:24.834
Frankly, I'm encouraged.

43:24.943 --> 43:27.170
With the fuckin' riddles again.

43:27.279 --> 43:30.465
I sat here dreading
the end of the story

43:30.574 --> 43:31.966
would involve you erupting

43:32.076 --> 43:35.386
in some act of violence
towards your nephew.

43:35.496 --> 43:37.472
Well, Christmas isn't over yet.

43:37.581 --> 43:39.182
You came out of that shooting

43:39.249 --> 43:41.642
feeling each day
is a "gift."

43:41.752 --> 43:44.020
Well, this is
a corollary to that.

43:44.505 --> 43:46.522
A what?

43:46.590 --> 43:50.276
You don't have to eat
every dish of rigatoni.

43:50.386 --> 43:53.029
You don't have to fuck
every female you meet.

43:57.935 --> 44:01.746
You know what I've
been realizing?

44:01.855 --> 44:04.707
These women...
they're all sort of the same...

44:04.775 --> 44:08.127
dark complexion, smart,

44:08.237 --> 44:10.880
they smell a little
bit of money.

44:10.948 --> 44:15.051
There's you and...
Gloria

44:15.160 --> 44:17.261
and this "Ashkenuzi."

44:19.623 --> 44:21.015
So what's that about?

44:21.125 --> 44:23.059
What do you think it's about?

44:29.299 --> 44:31.567
Well... ahem...

44:31.635 --> 44:33.736
It's probably
the reason I still come here

44:33.804 --> 44:36.113
to hang out with you...

44:36.223 --> 44:38.908
'cause nothing really changes
with the therapy part.

45:24.021 --> 45:26.163
Ton'? That fed's
out front. Harris.

45:26.273 --> 45:28.791
Says he wants you to know
he's here having a sandwich.

45:41.371 --> 45:42.930
What's the matter?
Not enough mayo?

45:43.040 --> 45:44.932
Tony, how you doing?

45:45.042 --> 45:48.311
Good, so how's
the War on Terror?

45:48.420 --> 45:51.981
Christmas is always
potentially our busy season.

45:52.716 --> 45:55.276
So, Phil Leotardo, huh?
Coronary?

45:55.385 --> 45:58.487
I swear to God
I had nothin' to do with that.

45:58.597 --> 46:01.115
Just so you know,

46:01.225 --> 46:03.492
I'm still in touch
with some agents who work O.C.

46:03.560 --> 46:06.162
From what they hear, you're not very
popular in Brooklyn right now.

46:06.271 --> 46:08.664
So what else is new, huh?

46:08.774 --> 46:11.250
That someone close to you
may be in danger.

46:11.360 --> 46:13.502
Really?

46:13.612 --> 46:15.838
Anybody specific?

46:15.948 --> 46:19.842
All they know is it's under serious
discussion at top levels.

46:28.085 --> 46:31.479
- Thanks.
- It's Christmas.

46:49.314 --> 46:51.207
What? You want me
to call a doctor?

46:51.275 --> 46:54.210
Cramping in my legs?
It could be anything.

46:54.319 --> 46:55.795
Well, then what'd
you call me for?

46:55.904 --> 46:58.214
- Just to say hi.
- But you're all right?

46:58.323 --> 47:00.883
Yeah.
I'll see you later.

47:03.120 --> 47:04.679
Bring me home
a quattro formaggi.

47:04.788 --> 47:06.555
I don't care what time it is.
Wake me up.

47:06.665 --> 47:08.683
- All right.
- Mwah.

47:18.886 --> 47:20.361
We were talking about recovery

47:20.470 --> 47:22.571
and your organized crime thing.

47:22.639 --> 47:24.991
That I took an oath

47:25.100 --> 47:26.951
that was a sacred oath.

47:27.060 --> 47:31.414
- That's not an urban legend?
- No, you burn a saint.

47:31.523 --> 47:35.251
You draw blood... but technically
I shouldn't even be tellin' you this.

47:35.360 --> 47:36.669
Ooh.

47:38.739 --> 47:41.173
The program...

47:41.283 --> 47:43.759
I could never really get
into the "Higher Power" part.

47:43.827 --> 47:45.928
Well, me neither.
It's hard.

47:47.414 --> 47:50.558
I mostly think of the group
consciousness as a Higher Power.

47:50.667 --> 47:55.229
I said to myself that that oath
would be my Higher Power.

47:55.339 --> 47:56.981
That would be my strength.

47:57.090 --> 47:59.025
That code... that's
a soldier's oath.

47:59.134 --> 48:01.652
- I could see that.
- But the problem is

48:01.762 --> 48:04.822
nobody lives it no more.
Not Tony, not nobody.

48:04.932 --> 48:07.742
They let you down.

48:10.604 --> 48:14.081
Whatever...
here I am.

48:14.191 --> 48:16.459
- Using.
- Using.

48:22.866 --> 48:24.300
Are you breaking up with me?

48:28.705 --> 48:30.598
No.

48:41.385 --> 48:43.277
Should we go to a meeting?

48:45.222 --> 48:47.740
I don't know.

48:47.849 --> 48:49.867
What do you wanna do?

48:52.312 --> 48:54.830
I know one that starts
in half an hour in Glen Ridge.

49:27.764 --> 49:29.698
Take one car?

49:30.809 --> 49:32.660
I'll follow you.

49:45.282 --> 49:47.049
You should've called first.

50:00.130 --> 50:03.190
How's John?

50:03.300 --> 50:04.733
Some Christmas present, huh?

50:07.763 --> 50:10.072
I'll see you in the morn...

50:13.852 --> 50:15.536
I'll see you in the morning.

50:15.645 --> 50:17.913
God loves you.

50:35.457 --> 50:38.851
Finally got you to come
to Brooklyn, cocksucker.

50:47.177 --> 50:49.195
Listen to me.

51:00.899 --> 51:03.417
Now, I never told nobody this,

51:03.527 --> 51:08.088
but while I was in that coma...

51:11.034 --> 51:13.010
somethin' happened to me.

51:14.412 --> 51:16.639
I went someplace...

51:19.042 --> 51:23.145
I think. But I know I never
wanna go back there.

51:24.881 --> 51:27.066
And maybe you know
what I'm talkin' about.

51:35.559 --> 51:37.701
Believe me, nobody ever
laid on their deathbed

51:37.811 --> 51:39.912
wishin' they saved
more no-show jobs.

51:45.485 --> 51:47.336
Now you take your time.

51:49.406 --> 51:51.882
You get better.

51:51.992 --> 51:54.760
And you get out
of this fuckin' place.

51:54.870 --> 51:58.514
But when you do,
you focus on grandkids

51:58.623 --> 52:01.392
and good things.

52:01.501 --> 52:04.561
We can have it all, Phil...

52:04.671 --> 52:06.522
plenty for everybody.

52:11.803 --> 52:14.154
Stop cryin' now.

52:22.939 --> 52:24.540
We should let him sleep.

52:29.112 --> 52:30.879
We gotta stop
meeting like this, huh?

53:00.518 --> 53:03.245
George, hi.
Carmela Soprano.

53:03.313 --> 53:06.582
Listen, I wanna move ahead with
the roofing... ordering the slate?

53:08.485 --> 53:10.252
Carm, you got cocktail sauce?

53:10.320 --> 53:11.837
Uh, in the fridge, top shelf.

53:13.156 --> 53:16.592
Bob Cratchit!
Pass out the punch!

53:16.701 --> 53:20.596
- Gift set...
- What I said is none of your business!

53:20.664 --> 53:22.848
I'll make it my business!

53:24.376 --> 53:27.770
- Sophia, come help, hon'.
- I don't like disturbances in my place.

53:27.879 --> 53:30.439
Either lay off
politics or get out!

53:32.676 --> 53:35.444
Jesus, that's a lot of presents.

53:35.512 --> 53:37.112
You sure you got enough?

53:37.222 --> 53:39.031
Remember you're
a kid... WABC?

53:39.140 --> 53:40.657
They'd tell you where Santa was,

53:40.767 --> 53:42.868
trackin' him on Air Force radar?

53:46.189 --> 53:48.957
Are you gonna hog all the ice?

53:53.113 --> 53:56.090
- To America.
- To America.

53:56.199 --> 53:58.133
To America.

53:58.243 --> 54:00.636
Hello.

54:00.704 --> 54:03.472
Everybody, this is Blanca.
Blanca, my mom,

54:03.540 --> 54:05.057
- my dad.
- Hi.

54:05.166 --> 54:07.351
This is Hector.
Say hello, baby.

54:07.460 --> 54:10.646
Hi, Hector.
Oh, look at those eyes.

54:12.215 --> 54:14.775
He's not so shy at home.

54:14.884 --> 54:17.403
Hey, that is quite a bagatelle.

54:17.512 --> 54:20.114
Oh, it's from Anthony.

54:20.223 --> 54:21.824
Really?

54:26.479 --> 54:29.415
Hector, no, papi!
Those ain't your presents.

54:29.482 --> 54:31.041
It's okay.
I got him.

54:31.735 --> 54:34.336
Hey, come here, you.
Come here.

54:35.071 --> 54:37.005
Who's coming later, huh?

54:37.115 --> 54:39.883
- Santa!
- Is Santa Claus coming, huh?

54:39.993 --> 54:42.803
- Carmela, it's Meadow!
- Tell her I kept my promise.

54:42.912 --> 54:45.180
I'm wearing
your present from Paris.

54:45.248 --> 54:48.392
Excuse me, my daughter's
calling from California.

54:58.595 --> 55:01.113
- Ahem...
- She's 10 years older than him

55:01.222 --> 55:03.365
and she's Puerto Rican.

55:03.475 --> 55:06.326
Dominican...
maybe.

55:07.771 --> 55:10.205
Least she's Catholic.

55:11.316 --> 55:12.791
What are you lookin'
at me like that for?

55:12.901 --> 55:14.626
You were overjoyed
when I sent him down there.

55:14.736 --> 55:16.253
Carmela, your daughter says

55:16.363 --> 55:18.547
you're using up
all her cell phone minutes.

55:21.117 --> 55:23.886
Nice piece, that necklace.
Where'd you get it?

55:23.953 --> 55:27.097
- The mall.
- Should've told me.

55:27.207 --> 55:30.017
- I got a guy.
- And I got a job.

55:32.170 --> 55:34.897
My dear mademoiselle,
perhaps you have already observed

55:35.006 --> 55:39.902
that in Casablanca human life is cheap.
Good night, mademoiselle.

55:39.969 --> 55:42.738
Okay, sweetie.
I love you too.

55:46.393 --> 55:48.202
Merry Christmas, baby.

55:50.647 --> 55:52.748
Yeah, we're all here,
same as always.

55:52.816 --> 55:54.750
Bobby Jr.,
get in here and eat!

55:56.486 --> 55:59.046
You want some wine?

55:59.155 --> 56:00.672
Aunt Barb's comin' later.

56:00.782 --> 56:02.883
Uncle Tom had to work.

56:03.993 --> 56:07.012
All right, honey.

56:07.122 --> 56:08.555
I miss you too.

56:10.500 --> 56:12.267
Merry Christmas.

56:14.295 --> 56:16.063
Love to Finn, huh?

56:28.351 --> 56:29.785
You have a gorgeous home.

56:29.894 --> 56:31.828
Thank you.

56:35.358 --> 56:37.209
We do.
