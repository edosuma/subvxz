02:00.996 --> 02:02.264
I'm warning
you, stay back.

02:02.297 --> 02:04.166
Stay back, I'll
kill you, stay back!

02:04.199 --> 02:06.201
Shoot him,
Frank, shoot him!

02:07.269 --> 02:08.538
Is he dead?

02:08.571 --> 02:10.239
You got
him, you got him.

02:10.272 --> 02:11.774
Good lord.

02:11.808 --> 02:13.910
- That's not possible.
- He's getting up!

02:13.943 --> 02:14.777
No.

02:14.811 --> 02:16.211
Run, Martha, run!

02:46.743 --> 02:48.745
Remember,
deliver for any extraneous ducks,

02:48.778 --> 02:50.045
but don't kill the goose.

02:50.880 --> 02:51.681
10-four.

02:56.819 --> 02:59.522
Copy that.

03:31.688 --> 03:32.789
Help! Help!

03:34.724 --> 03:37.660
Initial numbers are
extremely promising.

03:37.694 --> 03:41.698
Reflexes, strength, you
name it, all enhanced.

03:42.599 --> 03:44.299
Blood tests.

03:44.333 --> 03:47.437
First scan shows a rare,
if not unique anemia.

03:47.470 --> 03:49.072
I ordered more testing.

03:49.104 --> 03:51.373
We should get the full
results in a few days.

03:51.407 --> 03:53.610
Good.

03:53.643 --> 03:56.779
Perhaps we could review
the results together.

03:59.181 --> 04:00.783
Together.

04:00.817 --> 04:03.720
Well, it would
certainly expedite things,

04:03.753 --> 04:04.988
getting your involvement.

04:05.021 --> 04:07.356
That's
not protocol.

04:07.390 --> 04:08.190
I know.

04:10.093 --> 04:11.360
My apologies.

04:13.161 --> 04:15.064
But up
for consideration.

04:19.535 --> 04:20.369
Yes, sir.

04:53.770 --> 04:55.071
Don't get too comfy.

05:15.024 --> 05:16.191
What do I call you?

05:19.662 --> 05:20.563
Do you have a name?

05:20.596 --> 05:22.865
You can call me John.

05:22.899 --> 05:23.833
Dr. Jansen.

05:23.866 --> 05:24.701
I know.

05:30.272 --> 05:31.306
What's your origin.

05:33.776 --> 05:34.944
Where do you come from?

05:35.812 --> 05:37.747
Let's say I tell you.

05:37.780 --> 05:39.449
Would you even know where it is?

05:39.482 --> 05:41.651
Of course, I
have the internet.

05:41.684 --> 05:43.486
Then you've heard of Planet X.

05:43.519 --> 05:45.287
Right next to
Planet Y, correct?

05:47.056 --> 05:49.425
I like you.

05:49.459 --> 05:50.292
You're funny.

05:51.293 --> 05:52.227
Like your sister.

05:56.099 --> 05:57.867
How do you know my sister?

05:57.900 --> 05:59.102
We know all about you.

06:00.203 --> 06:01.236
We know everything.

06:01.269 --> 06:02.105
Where is she?

06:04.407 --> 06:05.273
Where is she?

06:07.744 --> 06:12.682
You are absolutely out
of your league, Dr. Jansen.

06:13.416 --> 06:15.118
We are coming for you.

06:16.085 --> 06:17.186
All of you.

06:34.437 --> 06:35.270
Alastair.

06:37.807 --> 06:38.708
Dr. Jansen.

06:39.909 --> 06:41.911
So nice to finally
meet you in person.

06:41.944 --> 06:43.679
I thought I'd never see the day.

06:45.313 --> 06:46.649
Great work finding Jim.

06:47.683 --> 06:48.985
Can I see the test results?

06:49.018 --> 06:50.086
Yes, of course.

06:50.119 --> 06:50.953
Right this way.

06:56.559 --> 06:57.760
Hi Jim.

06:57.794 --> 06:58.861
Hi Dr. Wang.

06:58.895 --> 07:00.463
How are you feeling today?

07:00.496 --> 07:01.631
Fine.

07:01.664 --> 07:03.533
And your migraines?

07:03.566 --> 07:05.201
Getting worse.

07:05.234 --> 07:07.136
Well, I think it was
smart of your doctor

07:07.170 --> 07:08.704
in Chicago to refer you here.

07:08.738 --> 07:10.206
Can you stay any longer?

07:10.239 --> 07:11.440
In Los Angeles?

07:11.474 --> 07:13.976
Jim, we need to
run a few more tests.

07:14.010 --> 07:15.845
Your anemia is very unusual.

07:15.878 --> 07:17.814
Your red blood cells
containing hemoglobin,

07:17.847 --> 07:20.216
which they use to transport
oxygen throughout your body.

07:20.249 --> 07:22.718
Unfortunately, because
of the irregular shape,

07:22.752 --> 07:24.387
not enough of them are
getting to your brain.

07:24.420 --> 07:26.489
Is that what's causing
my sudden headaches?

07:26.522 --> 07:27.723
As I was saying, we're
gonna have to conduct

07:27.757 --> 07:29.959
a few more tests,
but in the meantime,

07:29.992 --> 07:32.728
I can prescribe some
medication for your pain.

07:32.762 --> 07:34.630
Thanks for getting somewhere.

07:34.664 --> 07:37.466
All right, just don't take
too many pills at one time.

07:37.500 --> 07:38.901
Does it look like I would?

07:40.837 --> 07:43.239
And there's one other
thing that we discovered.

07:43.272 --> 07:44.540
My health can't
get anyworse, can it?

07:44.574 --> 07:46.642
We wanted to be
absolutely certain

07:46.676 --> 07:48.878
that we understood what
was causing your symptoms,

07:48.911 --> 07:51.080
So we tested, well-

07:51.113 --> 07:52.347
- Just say it, doc.

07:53.749 --> 07:56.351
We discovered during our
analyses that you're sterile.

07:56.385 --> 07:59.155
Now, look, this isn't gonna
affect your health at all,

07:59.188 --> 08:01.958
but it's something I thought
you'd want to be aware of.

08:05.394 --> 08:07.063
Is there something
you can do about that?

08:07.096 --> 08:09.665
Well, I am one of the top
hematologists in the country,

08:09.699 --> 08:12.602
so maybe with further
tests, we could find

08:12.635 --> 08:14.303
the root cause of
your condition.

08:19.742 --> 08:21.644
Hold on a second, I
have to take this.

08:26.883 --> 08:27.884
Hey Doc?

08:40.630 --> 08:41.464
Doc?

08:46.402 --> 08:50.973
Dr. Wang?

08:51.007 --> 08:51.874
Hello?

08:53.175 --> 08:54.378
Is anyone there?

09:00.783 --> 09:01.584
Doc?

09:28.344 --> 09:29.178
Hello?

09:45.261 --> 09:46.696
Wait, did you have
an episode again?

09:46.729 --> 09:48.297
You want us to come visit you?

09:56.639 --> 09:57.707
John.

09:57.740 --> 09:58.908
You're gonna shoot it.

10:00.576 --> 10:01.944
Dark Ridge sand.

10:33.109 --> 10:33.943
Jim?

10:36.912 --> 10:38.214
Dr. Jansen.

10:38.247 --> 10:39.081
Jim.

10:40.049 --> 10:41.050
How are you feeling?

10:42.685 --> 10:44.720
Physically, pretty good.

10:44.754 --> 10:45.788
Good.

10:45.821 --> 10:46.756
Sit down.

10:46.789 --> 10:47.990
You've been out for three days.

10:48.924 --> 10:50.460
That long.

10:50.494 --> 10:51.594
I tried to wake you up.

10:51.627 --> 10:52.928
What is that blue-

10:52.962 --> 10:54.163
- Energy.

10:54.196 --> 10:55.865
For lack of a better word.

10:55.898 --> 10:57.501
There are a lot of
things here at the base

10:57.533 --> 11:01.070
that will defy the logic
the rest of the world knows.

11:01.103 --> 11:03.706
For now you can think of
it as an organic energy

11:03.739 --> 11:05.808
we use to power this facility.

11:05.841 --> 11:08.611
Doors, among other things.

11:08.644 --> 11:10.079
Angela?

11:10.112 --> 11:12.048
- Can I see her?
- Sure.

11:12.081 --> 11:13.816
She's been assisting
me in the lab.

11:13.849 --> 11:14.683
She okay?

11:15.618 --> 11:16.453
Yeah.

11:17.653 --> 11:19.722
Yeah, I think she can
use some slowing down

11:20.956 --> 11:22.558
with the loss of your friends.

11:23.559 --> 11:25.361
She's uhm...

11:25.395 --> 11:26.796
She's obsessed.

11:27.963 --> 11:29.932
What can I do to help?

11:29.965 --> 11:31.501
Well, you're the
only human up until now

11:31.535 --> 11:32.902
who's been able to resist-

11:32.935 --> 11:33.736
- The red dust?

11:33.769 --> 11:34.904
We call it Ash.

11:36.372 --> 11:38.841
Can I ask you, what
were your parents like?

11:38.874 --> 11:40.510
- Biological ones?
- Mm-hmm.

11:40.544 --> 11:42.778
I was adopted at an
orphanage in Hong Kong.

11:42.812 --> 11:44.680
Brought me to Chicago
when I was eight.

11:44.713 --> 11:46.182
Recently I went back.

11:46.215 --> 11:48.084
Wouldn't give me the records.

11:48.117 --> 11:49.318
Okay, well, if you don't mind,

11:49.351 --> 11:51.587
we'll do some research
on your background.

11:51.620 --> 11:53.423
In the meantime, we
took some blood samples

11:53.457 --> 11:54.890
while you were asleep.

11:54.924 --> 11:55.858
You did?

11:55.891 --> 11:57.593
Sorry, no time to waste.

11:57.626 --> 11:59.195
Angela will come and
see you after your

11:59.228 --> 12:01.097
introductory combat
training course.

12:01.130 --> 12:02.399
Combat training?

12:02.432 --> 12:03.732
Well, you asked how
you could help, right?

12:03.766 --> 12:05.034
Yeah, but I'm no
in the field type.

12:05.067 --> 12:06.702
I applied to be an analyst.

12:06.735 --> 12:08.472
Perhaps before exposure.

12:08.505 --> 12:10.639
You took out several
highly trained soldiers

12:10.673 --> 12:12.875
who were under the
effects of Ash.

12:12.908 --> 12:14.310
I'd say you're qualified.

12:16.212 --> 12:18.280
Couldn't save my
friends, so who cares?

12:21.183 --> 12:22.017
Look.

12:24.720 --> 12:26.490
I lost my sister to this too.

12:26.523 --> 12:29.792
Many in this facility have
have lost friends and family.

12:32.061 --> 12:35.297
But you're the first
breakthrough we've had in years.

12:35.331 --> 12:37.434
So you'll learn how
to become one of us

12:37.467 --> 12:39.935
while we test and examine
your capabilities.

12:41.904 --> 12:42.705
Now suit up.

13:00.789 --> 13:02.324
Hi, you must be Jim.

13:02.358 --> 13:03.659
- Aaron.
- Nice to meet you.

13:03.692 --> 13:05.261
I can't wait for you
to run the gauntlet

13:05.294 --> 13:07.830
with your abilities.

13:07.863 --> 13:09.499
It's designed to test and train

13:09.533 --> 13:11.000
the best soldiers in the world.

13:12.402 --> 13:15.237
Let's get you set up with
some of our new tactical gear.

13:15.271 --> 13:17.940
These are training phasers.

13:17.973 --> 13:19.476
Phasers are just
like regular firearms

13:19.509 --> 13:23.345
except they fire a
spherical, energized round.

13:27.617 --> 13:29.685
You're human, you get a
nice little electrical jolt

13:29.718 --> 13:31.187
to signify your hit.

13:31.220 --> 13:34.023
If you're a RUNT,
you get shut down.

13:34.056 --> 13:35.458
RUNTs?

13:35.492 --> 13:38.127
Robotic Unit
Enforcement Trainers?

13:39.161 --> 13:40.796
Dr. Jansen didn't tell you?

13:40.829 --> 13:42.031
No.

13:42.064 --> 13:42.831
Nice to know. I'm
not the only one here

13:42.865 --> 13:43.899
on a need to know basis.

13:48.103 --> 13:49.539
What's this?

13:49.573 --> 13:50.773
And I hope you don't
mind if I took the liberty

13:50.806 --> 13:53.410
of upgrading your
armor a little bit.

13:53.443 --> 13:55.144
I was a double-E at Cornell.

13:55.177 --> 13:56.145
Electrical engineer.

13:56.178 --> 13:58.247
So how did you get here?

13:58.280 --> 13:59.782
Well, I graduated
when I was 16,

13:59.815 --> 14:02.652
and some weapons I designed
ended up in the wrong hands.

14:02.686 --> 14:04.621
So to keep myself
out of trouble.

14:04.654 --> 14:05.721
And the robots.

14:06.789 --> 14:08.924
You'll find out soon enough.

14:08.958 --> 14:10.460
Let's go.

14:10.493 --> 14:11.260
Right.

14:11.293 --> 14:13.229
So I got you this.

14:13.262 --> 14:15.565
I've outfitted it with a
camera and a communicator.

14:15.599 --> 14:17.299
So, yeah.

14:17.333 --> 14:18.167
Thanks.

14:18.200 --> 14:19.034
Good luck.

14:25.975 --> 14:28.811
Okay, Jim, we'll
start you off slow.

14:31.615 --> 14:32.815
What's my objective?

14:32.848 --> 14:35.552
Eliminate as
many RUNTs as possible.

14:35.585 --> 14:36.986
Seems simple enough.

14:37.019 --> 14:38.354
Starting off on level three.

14:38.388 --> 14:39.788
Ma'am, you said slow.

14:39.822 --> 14:41.023
It's a relative term.

14:42.091 --> 14:43.493
Five.

14:43.526 --> 14:44.326
Four.

14:44.360 --> 14:46.228
Dispensing R.U.N.T.s.

14:47.162 --> 14:48.431
Two.

14:48.465 --> 14:49.298
- Now.
- One.

14:50.533 --> 14:52.801
Active.

15:22.532 --> 15:23.733
How's he doing?

15:23.767 --> 15:25.834
He is turning level
three into Swiss cheese.

15:28.270 --> 15:29.606
He's already on level three?

15:29.639 --> 15:30.774
Go to level four.

15:34.176 --> 15:34.977
Billy!

15:35.010 --> 15:36.278
Oh, yep, okay.

15:36.312 --> 15:37.514
Yeah.

15:37.547 --> 15:38.448
Level four.

15:38.481 --> 15:41.418
Three, two, one.

15:41.451 --> 15:42.351
Right now.

15:42.385 --> 15:43.319
Level four.

15:48.491 --> 15:49.793
Gettin' fancy, Jim.

15:54.229 --> 15:55.164
He's so fast.

16:02.171 --> 16:03.272
Level five.

16:04.708 --> 16:05.608
Ma'am.

16:11.347 --> 16:12.615
I can't watch this.

16:12.649 --> 16:14.316
Level five?

16:14.350 --> 16:16.218
Level
five verified.

16:18.087 --> 16:19.355
All right, I gotta watch this.

16:36.071 --> 16:38.441
What the hell?

16:46.081 --> 16:46.949
Not bad.

16:47.983 --> 16:49.218
Run him through it again.

16:49.251 --> 16:50.587
No...

16:50.620 --> 16:51.454
Ma'am?

16:54.591 --> 16:55.392
Seriously?

16:57.627 --> 16:59.562
We are not his parents, Lucy.

17:00.797 --> 17:02.131
He's never gonna accept it.

17:06.636 --> 17:08.738
What did you expect?

17:08.772 --> 17:10.939
He was eight years old
when we adopted him.

17:11.841 --> 17:13.208
I wanted a baby!

17:18.381 --> 17:19.915
Hi Jim.

17:19.948 --> 17:20.784
I'm Charles.

17:22.852 --> 17:24.253
We're your new parents.

17:24.286 --> 17:26.288
And we're gonna take
you to a new place.

17:38.668 --> 17:39.502
I know.

17:44.674 --> 17:47.276
I never thought he would
get into this much trouble.

17:48.578 --> 17:49.913
I didn't think so either.

17:52.816 --> 17:53.850
You tried, Charles.

17:57.787 --> 17:59.321
That's it.

17:59.354 --> 18:00.857
When he turns 18, we're done.

18:23.413 --> 18:25.548
Jim, how do you resist?

18:25.582 --> 18:27.784
Look how pathetic
humans are without us.

18:27.817 --> 18:30.219
Everything feels
better when I listen.

18:30.252 --> 18:31.053
There's a cure, okay?

18:31.086 --> 18:32.221
Listen to me!

18:32.254 --> 18:34.990
- Kill me, please!
- I can't...

18:38.428 --> 18:39.361
No, please.

18:49.539 --> 18:50.372
Hey.

18:51.441 --> 18:52.274
Hey.

18:53.610 --> 18:54.444
Are you all right?

18:54.477 --> 18:55.310
Mm-hmm.

18:56.479 --> 18:58.247
Wait, you can't be here.

18:58.280 --> 18:59.348
Your residency.

18:59.382 --> 19:01.083
I took a leave of absence

19:03.620 --> 19:05.153
That's your dream, Angela.

19:06.021 --> 19:07.824
I can't face them right now.

19:13.963 --> 19:15.865
What do we tell them?

19:17.065 --> 19:19.301
Dr. Jansen said that
they're gonna help us

19:19.334 --> 19:21.370
devise an explanation
when we're ready.

19:25.340 --> 19:28.277
Can't imagine
what that would be.

19:29.646 --> 19:31.748
I'm hoping that
a little time here,

19:31.781 --> 19:34.617
and we'll figure it out.

19:37.085 --> 19:37.921
Together.

19:48.765 --> 19:49.566
Hey Jim.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.802
Hey, don't worry
about level five.

19:52.835 --> 19:55.038
You know, it was your first
time, you'll figure it out.

19:55.070 --> 19:56.305
How many levels are there?

19:56.338 --> 19:57.774
One through five
is single player.

19:57.807 --> 20:00.208
Six, seven, eight,
are multiplayer.

20:00.242 --> 20:03.947
Is it true that you have
some of the Ash's powers?

20:03.980 --> 20:05.080
This is Higgins.

20:05.113 --> 20:06.281
He lost his parents to the Ash.

20:06.315 --> 20:07.650
I'm afraid so.

20:07.684 --> 20:08.918
Is it contagious?

20:08.952 --> 20:10.987
He would've been quarantined.

20:11.020 --> 20:13.155
I heard that they scanned
your body and the Ash

20:13.188 --> 20:14.757
is somehow inert inside of you?

20:15.892 --> 20:17.694
Just in case, I'll
try not to cough on you.

20:17.727 --> 20:21.664
Mr. Yung, you've been requested
in conference room nine.

20:21.698 --> 20:22.532
Thanks.

20:23.466 --> 20:24.834
You're gonna meet him.

20:26.234 --> 20:27.470
- Who?
- Alastair.

20:28.605 --> 20:29.906
At least that's
what they call him.

20:29.939 --> 20:33.042
I heard he's here, on base.

20:33.977 --> 20:34.811
So?

20:36.278 --> 20:38.514
Who do you think's paying
for this whole operation?

20:38.548 --> 20:39.782
The government?

20:42.518 --> 20:44.687
No, this is a big deal, okay?

20:44.721 --> 20:45.888
He's never been here.

20:45.922 --> 20:47.924
To conceal his
identity, of course.

20:49.224 --> 20:50.727
Go!

20:50.760 --> 20:54.764
Alastair is the founder
of our agency, the ESU.

20:54.797 --> 20:56.933
Extraterrestrial
Special Forces Unit.

20:58.367 --> 21:01.638
Firstly, I'm sorry for what
happened to your friends.

21:03.406 --> 21:04.641
Thanks.

21:04.674 --> 21:07.142
I read your
application to the CIA.

21:07.175 --> 21:08.310
You did?

21:08.343 --> 21:10.178
It was a good essay.

21:10.212 --> 21:11.848
Didn't help me get accepted.

21:11.881 --> 21:15.317
Well, perhaps you weren't
meant to work at that agency.

21:15.350 --> 21:16.819
Why did you start this one?

21:22.025 --> 21:25.461
About 25 years ago, I
created an internet company

21:25.495 --> 21:27.630
that does blockchain
financial trades

21:27.664 --> 21:29.197
using artificial intelligence.

21:30.165 --> 21:31.934
It went I.P.O..

21:31.968 --> 21:34.437
Before I knew it, my
wealth was in the league

21:34.470 --> 21:37.440
of a small number of
people on this planet.

21:37.473 --> 21:41.411
I started getting invited
to private elite parties.

21:42.845 --> 21:44.981
Eventually, these
individuals asked me

21:45.014 --> 21:46.783
to join a secret group.

21:46.816 --> 21:49.419
But as I delved
further, joining them

21:49.452 --> 21:54.090
meant serving the Kinians,
a powerful alien race.

21:55.458 --> 21:58.861
I thought it was a
legend, until I was asked

21:58.895 --> 21:59.796
to do something.

22:01.196 --> 22:03.298
Something I will never
forgive myself for.

22:05.601 --> 22:08.571
After I left, I disappeared.

22:09.505 --> 22:11.107
It wasn't easy.

22:11.140 --> 22:12.909
They started going
after all the people

22:12.942 --> 22:16.412
that were close to me,
so I started this agency

22:17.680 --> 22:19.515
to protect people I care about,

22:19.549 --> 22:23.351
and the human race, for
what is to eventually come

22:23.386 --> 22:24.554
if we don't stop them.

22:26.354 --> 22:27.590
What's coming?

22:29.025 --> 22:32.695
The Ash has great power,
and is used as a weapon

22:32.729 --> 22:35.565
by the aliens to
control human beings.

22:35.598 --> 22:37.299
For a while, they
stopped using the Ash.

22:37.332 --> 22:39.334
They found they didn't need it.

22:39.367 --> 22:43.271
Greed was enough to
keep us under control.

22:43.305 --> 22:44.207
Until now.

22:46.308 --> 22:48.343
What's changed?

22:48.377 --> 22:49.879
We don't know, Jim.

22:49.912 --> 22:54.117
We do know long ago, we were
used as slaves and servants.

22:55.485 --> 22:58.788
There seems to be something
greater they're after.

22:58.821 --> 23:00.790
You mentioned in your encounter

23:00.823 --> 23:04.026
you were able to communicate
with them telepathically.

23:04.060 --> 23:04.961
Potentially.

23:06.562 --> 23:08.097
I'm not really sure.

23:08.131 --> 23:11.701
Then we need you to make
contact with one of them.

23:11.734 --> 23:14.570
Try to find out what
their purpose is now.

23:14.604 --> 23:17.140
There are risks you
should be aware of.

23:17.173 --> 23:21.644
I prefer a more
scientific approach.

23:21.677 --> 23:23.146
What are the risks?

23:23.179 --> 23:27.183
I believe you'd be entering
some sort of dimension

23:27.216 --> 23:30.720
or mind realm where they
store their information.

23:30.753 --> 23:32.354
Given that your
mind is traveling,

23:32.388 --> 23:36.492
you may get lost and
never find your way back.

23:36.526 --> 23:37.359
Or worse.

23:38.761 --> 23:39.762
I won't force you.

23:40.930 --> 23:41.831
So think about it.

23:46.702 --> 23:50.773
I believe you'd be entering
in some sort of dimension

23:50.807 --> 23:52.208
or mind realm.

23:52.241 --> 23:53.576
Mr. Yung.

23:53.609 --> 23:55.144
I need you to count
yourself lucky

23:55.178 --> 23:56.813
that I'm not about
to haul your ass down

23:56.846 --> 23:59.148
to the precinct right now.

23:59.182 --> 24:01.751
So I need you to
promise me something.

24:01.784 --> 24:03.386
I need you to promise
me that I'm never gonna

24:03.419 --> 24:05.788
see you around here again.

24:05.822 --> 24:09.192
Next time, I'm not
gonna be so lenient.

24:09.225 --> 24:10.560
Do you understand that?

24:12.962 --> 24:15.363
I said, do you understand that?

24:16.599 --> 24:18.034
Yes.

24:18.067 --> 24:19.468
Yes what?

24:24.574 --> 24:25.575
Yes...

24:27.076 --> 24:27.910
Sir.

24:29.078 --> 24:30.213
Good.

24:30.246 --> 24:32.215
Now get outta here.

24:32.248 --> 24:33.749
I'm Captain Linden.

24:33.783 --> 24:36.018
We have readings of a strong
electromagnetic disturbance

24:36.052 --> 24:36.986
in the area.

24:37.019 --> 24:38.588
Any idea where it's coming from?

24:38.621 --> 24:39.922
Just over that ridge.

24:39.956 --> 24:41.224
I'll show you

24:41.257 --> 24:42.992
What's the deal, boys?

24:43.025 --> 24:43.826
Get down.

24:43.860 --> 24:45.061
Get down, now!

24:45.094 --> 24:48.464
Go, go, go, go!

24:50.299 --> 24:52.134
We're part of a
covert task force.

24:52.168 --> 24:54.136
Group of grays
who have developed

24:54.170 --> 24:55.905
biological control mechanisms.

24:57.173 --> 24:57.974
They're starting to move.

24:58.007 --> 24:59.208
I'll buy 'em off.

24:59.242 --> 25:01.677
Dr. Victoria Jansen,
trust no one else!

25:06.048 --> 25:06.782
Hey Jim

25:09.819 --> 25:10.620
Jim.

25:12.088 --> 25:13.489
You okay?

25:13.522 --> 25:14.657
Yeah, I'm fine.

25:15.825 --> 25:16.726
The team's back.

25:17.860 --> 25:18.828
Sorry, what?

25:18.861 --> 25:20.329
- Who?
- Our main faction.

25:21.264 --> 25:22.865
Yeah, we're number 53.

25:22.899 --> 25:24.333
Every base has a number.

25:24.367 --> 25:25.234
Ours is 53.

25:25.268 --> 25:26.736
There's 52, 51.

25:26.769 --> 25:28.971
You may have heard of, the
government likes to act

25:29.005 --> 25:30.606
like it's one of theirs.

25:30.640 --> 25:34.710
That's Smith, Rogers,
Bell, and Captain Linden.

25:36.445 --> 25:37.280
Captain Linden.

25:38.681 --> 25:43.686
He looks a lot like the
marine I met in the desert.

25:44.854 --> 25:46.022
We don't talk
about his brother.

25:47.690 --> 25:48.524
Hey.

25:50.126 --> 25:52.396
Hey, this is Jim.

25:52.428 --> 25:53.496
Yeah, we know.

25:54.764 --> 25:56.232
We heard you
wrecked the gauntlet.

25:56.265 --> 25:57.700
Practically demolished it.

25:58.935 --> 25:59.769
That's good.

26:00.703 --> 26:02.238
But RUNTs aren't marines.

26:03.239 --> 26:04.774
Well...

26:04.807 --> 26:05.808
I don't know, Cap.

26:07.476 --> 26:08.378
He did pretty well.

26:08.412 --> 26:09.912
You should check his scorecard.

26:12.448 --> 26:13.282
I was lucky.

26:15.584 --> 26:17.421
Let's try your
luck in a scrimmage.

26:18.854 --> 26:20.022
Sorry?

26:20.056 --> 26:23.159
You, Aaron, Billy
versus us three.

26:23.192 --> 26:25.661
I'll give you Smith, he's
one of my best soldiers.

26:26.529 --> 26:27.830
So it'll be four V three.

26:28.965 --> 26:30.599
I don't think
that's a good idea.

26:30.633 --> 26:31.435
No way.

26:31.467 --> 26:32.301
It'll be fun.

26:36.005 --> 26:37.039
You can keep Smith.

26:38.774 --> 26:39.709
I'll take Higgins.

26:43.879 --> 26:45.081
May the best team win.

26:46.916 --> 26:48.084
Are you crazy?

26:48.117 --> 26:49.453
Why did you just do that?

26:51.287 --> 26:52.121
We'll see.

26:52.154 --> 26:53.022
No, you...

26:54.458 --> 26:55.257
"We'll see."

26:55.291 --> 26:56.125
Okay.

26:58.961 --> 27:00.397
This is amazing.

27:04.533 --> 27:06.669
- Turns red blood cells-
- Yeah.

27:06.702 --> 27:08.904
The irregularly shaped ones.

27:08.938 --> 27:10.639
The robot added some
Ash to his blood

27:10.673 --> 27:11.974
in the isolation chamber.

27:13.443 --> 27:15.177
Here are some normal
red blood cells

27:15.211 --> 27:19.383
with the Ash, and
Jim's red blood cells.

27:19.416 --> 27:21.717
- Won't let the Ash latch on.
- Yeah.

27:21.751 --> 27:23.352
Because of their shape and form.

27:24.320 --> 27:25.788
And without a proper connection,

27:25.821 --> 27:28.458
the Ash can't circulate in
the blood like it wants to.

27:30.659 --> 27:32.762
Where does he get all
of his strength from,

27:32.795 --> 27:35.097
the healing, the
stamina, like the others?

27:36.198 --> 27:39.802
It looks like some sort of
advanced human gene therapy.

27:39.835 --> 27:41.737
But what really
stands out is that

27:41.771 --> 27:44.707
Jim has a set of genes
that I can't seem

27:44.740 --> 27:47.411
to match or identify with
anything we've seen before.

27:48.577 --> 27:50.212
Do you think that's
the key to the cure?

27:50.246 --> 27:52.648
To identify those
specific genes?

27:52.681 --> 27:53.682
I hope so.

27:55.618 --> 27:58.220
You did genetic screening
in your residency, right?

27:58.254 --> 27:59.055
Yeah.

27:59.088 --> 28:00.656
How'd you know?

28:00.689 --> 28:03.659
We have access to all
the information here.

28:03.692 --> 28:06.396
Why don't you track down an
old blood sample of Jim's

28:06.430 --> 28:08.197
and start comparing it
with a new blood sample?

28:08.230 --> 28:09.065
Okay.

28:17.006 --> 28:19.141
Jim, we meet again.

28:24.847 --> 28:26.682
Really, how are you?

28:27.783 --> 28:28.984
Where's John?

28:29.018 --> 28:31.320
You want to come
inside and see?

28:31.353 --> 28:33.255
Try and talk to the other John?

28:33.289 --> 28:34.323
He's doing just fine.

28:34.356 --> 28:35.858
Maybe even better than before.

28:43.732 --> 28:44.800
Where are we?

28:44.834 --> 28:45.734
I don't know.

28:45.768 --> 28:49.539
Another dimension, realm.

28:49.573 --> 28:51.575
Hey Jim, I may have
found something,

28:51.607 --> 28:54.143
but there's something blocking
me from taking you further.

28:54.176 --> 28:55.378
What do I do?

28:55.412 --> 28:57.880
Find a way to
get better access.

29:05.688 --> 29:06.523
See?

29:08.991 --> 29:10.860
We are the ones in control.

29:18.535 --> 29:21.237
You are making
amazing progress.

29:21.270 --> 29:22.705
But I still can't
interface with them.

29:22.738 --> 29:24.240
It's still on his terms.

29:25.174 --> 29:26.008
That'll come.

29:28.478 --> 29:29.546
So what do you think?

29:33.550 --> 29:34.650
Does it make lattes?

29:43.726 --> 29:44.561
Where does it go?

29:45.629 --> 29:46.795
All over the world.

29:47.997 --> 29:49.765
How did you discover
these tunnels?

29:49.798 --> 29:50.799
I didn't.

29:50.833 --> 29:52.201
A villager in China discovered

29:52.234 --> 29:54.604
the Long Yo Caves
back in the '90s.

29:54.638 --> 29:59.141
Computer, tell Jim about
the Long Yo Grotto Caves.

29:59.175 --> 30:00.976
Experts
estimate it would have taken

30:01.010 --> 30:04.013
1000 workers working day
and night for six years

30:04.046 --> 30:07.349
to remove 900,000 cubic
meters of solid rock.

30:08.618 --> 30:09.952
And we just reverse engineered

30:09.985 --> 30:11.454
this ship to travel through.

30:11.488 --> 30:14.424
We've only been operating
for the past few years.

30:14.457 --> 30:15.858
Who created these tunnels?

30:17.293 --> 30:21.230
Computer, how good are
you at making lattes?

30:21.263 --> 30:22.566
Unparalleled.

30:24.501 --> 30:27.236
The Kinians are an alien
race that settled on Earth

30:27.269 --> 30:29.205
500,000 years ago.

30:31.907 --> 30:33.375
They are back, Jim.

30:33.410 --> 30:38.881
The meteor you stumbled upon,
its frequency is increasing.

30:40.049 --> 30:43.453
Forget about movies where
gigantic ships land in our cities.

30:43.486 --> 30:46.889
This is a real war,
and they're using

30:46.922 --> 30:49.693
the same tactics we use
to take over a country

30:49.725 --> 30:53.929
and install a government
that serves our own economy

30:53.963 --> 30:55.331
from the inside.

30:57.233 --> 31:02.204
When I learned about the
aliens from Captain Linden,

31:02.838 --> 31:03.673
I wanted to run.

31:04.873 --> 31:05.975
You should have.

31:07.943 --> 31:11.448
You know, I never felt
so much ability, power.

31:12.281 --> 31:13.115
But...

31:17.554 --> 31:19.456
Most people
still would've run.

31:22.492 --> 31:25.094
When I saw what the
Ash was capable of,

31:26.529 --> 31:33.436
I knew they would find us,
and they would find Angela.

31:34.837 --> 31:39.808
In protecting the ones we
love, the world can be stronger.

31:44.880 --> 31:47.384
All right, I'll set it
to team competition mode,

31:47.417 --> 31:49.452
100 point score card.

31:49.486 --> 31:50.919
Each RUNT kill is worth a point.

31:50.953 --> 31:53.989
A player kill is worth
10, juggernaut's worth 25.

31:54.023 --> 31:55.558
Juggernaut?

31:55.592 --> 31:57.059
Yeah, it's a...

31:57.092 --> 31:58.027
Nevermind.

31:58.060 --> 31:59.361
Okay.

31:59.396 --> 32:00.896
- Put 'em in their place.
- Copy that.

32:05.468 --> 32:06.569
You guys stay center.

32:06.603 --> 32:08.170
Check.

32:08.203 --> 32:09.539
You got it.

32:09.572 --> 32:10.339
Can't wait.

32:10.372 --> 32:11.874
Five.

32:11.907 --> 32:13.309
Four.

32:13.342 --> 32:14.778
Three.

32:14.810 --> 32:15.645
Two.

32:16.479 --> 32:17.480
One.

32:55.752 --> 32:57.487
Clear, advance.

32:57.520 --> 32:58.354
Go!

33:02.057 --> 33:02.991
Let's pick it up.

33:08.732 --> 33:10.132
Copy that.

33:16.305 --> 33:19.241
- How we doing?
- We're behind in kills.

33:19.274 --> 33:21.176
We need to take out
their team to catch up.

33:26.416 --> 33:27.784
Dammit!

33:27.817 --> 33:28.785
Sorry, team.

33:33.757 --> 33:34.557
Yes!

33:34.591 --> 33:35.425
You're out.

33:42.866 --> 33:44.933
Jim, we're down 15.

33:44.967 --> 33:47.437
Don't focus on the
juggernaut, he's worth 25,

33:47.470 --> 33:49.672
but he'll be really hard
to take out by yourself.

33:49.706 --> 33:52.776
You're better off taking
down Linden and Bell.

34:00.048 --> 34:01.651
Jim, take Bell out!

34:09.258 --> 34:10.058
Ah, man.

34:15.030 --> 34:16.932
Hey, big man.

34:16.965 --> 34:17.867
Over here!

34:36.653 --> 34:37.487
Nice job.

34:39.988 --> 34:40.790
Good game.

34:47.996 --> 34:48.798
Thanks.

35:03.278 --> 35:04.279
What have you got?

35:05.782 --> 35:08.918
Okay, there's there's
already some obvious findings.

35:10.319 --> 35:13.756
It's like the Ash turned on
genes related to human function.

35:13.790 --> 35:15.592
Activated them somehow.

35:15.625 --> 35:17.560
Huh, what functions?

35:17.594 --> 35:19.496
Okay, so for example,
his DNA over here

35:19.529 --> 35:21.631
handles his adrenal
glands, and this one

35:21.664 --> 35:23.031
muscle fiber recruitment.

35:23.065 --> 35:24.366
- Strength.
- Yeah.

35:25.535 --> 35:27.002
His white blood cell
production, platelets,

35:27.035 --> 35:28.538
immune system over here.

35:28.571 --> 35:29.439
Healing.

35:30.707 --> 35:32.307
What about the liver?

35:32.341 --> 35:34.911
Is it his weakness,
like the others?

35:34.944 --> 35:36.412
I'm not sure.

35:36.446 --> 35:39.114
The liver's the one organ
that's extremely complicated

35:39.147 --> 35:42.084
in terms of its DNA because of
its regenerative properties.

35:44.186 --> 35:45.488
My guess is yes.

35:46.823 --> 35:48.357
I'm hoping that I'm wrong.

35:49.859 --> 35:51.961
Too bad we can't
test your theory, huh?

35:54.096 --> 35:55.765
Good job, Angela.

35:55.798 --> 35:56.633
I mean, Doctor.

35:57.534 --> 35:58.701
You're one also, right?

36:00.003 --> 36:02.972
Second year of
residency.

36:10.780 --> 36:11.581
Good.

36:12.749 --> 36:15.018
For you and for
what you have...

36:15.050 --> 36:18.153
Oh my god, can you
imagine the possibilities?

36:19.022 --> 36:20.023
What we could learn?

36:22.725 --> 36:23.960
We could heal people.

36:25.093 --> 36:27.897
We could maybe cure cancer.

36:27.931 --> 36:30.332
Why couldn't this happen
to somebody stronger?

36:30.365 --> 36:31.501
Smarter?

36:31.534 --> 36:33.536
What if this did
happen to someone else?

36:34.737 --> 36:37.774
Hey, I think there's
a reason it was you.

36:39.274 --> 36:40.410
I'm not even average.

36:44.881 --> 36:47.417
Do you remember when I
was studying for my NCATs?

36:49.117 --> 36:50.587
Of course I do.

36:50.620 --> 36:52.220
It's because you spent
all that time quizzing me

36:52.254 --> 36:53.723
that I scored so well.

36:54.691 --> 36:56.025
That's not average.

36:58.027 --> 36:59.062
Who you are...

37:00.797 --> 37:01.898
It's not average.

37:06.268 --> 37:07.870
You're crazy.

37:07.904 --> 37:11.340
I know.

37:11.373 --> 37:12.207
Oh.

37:13.076 --> 37:14.711
You're capable of anything.

37:17.080 --> 37:18.448
Except maybe cooking.

37:20.717 --> 37:22.150
Was something
that we already did

37:22.184 --> 37:24.554
- where I specified which team-
- You want to sit with us?

37:25.555 --> 37:26.389
Really?

37:29.459 --> 37:30.292
I'm fine here.

37:31.661 --> 37:32.462
Okay.

37:34.262 --> 37:35.898
You can join us
if that's okay.

37:38.768 --> 37:40.903
- I can.
- Have a seat.

37:44.373 --> 37:45.608
Really like the new M4s.

37:46.876 --> 37:48.210
Handle really nice.

37:48.243 --> 37:50.446
Light, powerful.

37:50.480 --> 37:53.315
Thanks, I've made some
upgrades here and there.

37:55.985 --> 37:58.353
So you did really
well in training.

38:00.288 --> 38:03.526
Thanks, but you guys won.

38:03.559 --> 38:04.794
Really?

38:04.827 --> 38:06.095
I mean, I'd say it
was more of a tie.

38:12.468 --> 38:16.973
Look, I read your case file.

38:17.006 --> 38:18.708
You reported when John
was first infected,

38:18.741 --> 38:20.410
you shot him in the chest.

38:20.443 --> 38:22.210
Ash leaked out,
touched your hand,

38:22.244 --> 38:25.014
and somehow his memory
and special forces skills

38:25.048 --> 38:26.849
are ingrained in you?

38:29.552 --> 38:30.653
Something like that.

38:33.188 --> 38:35.190
It still doesn't
explain your courage.

38:36.993 --> 38:38.428
What are you talking about?

38:40.362 --> 38:43.833
Look, I've fought
with a lot of men,

38:43.866 --> 38:47.603
and under pressure, they fold
when outnumbered or outgunned

38:47.637 --> 38:50.540
and you weren't even
playing the same game

38:50.573 --> 38:51.641
as everybody else.

38:53.241 --> 38:54.677
I just did what came to me.

39:01.918 --> 39:05.688
Maybe you're just not aware
of what you're capable of yet.

39:08.725 --> 39:09.559
Excuse me.

39:13.062 --> 39:14.430
Where's she going?

39:17.365 --> 39:20.436
We found some records
on your biological mother.

39:20.470 --> 39:23.673
You'll be glad to know she's
doing well in Hong Kong.

39:23.706 --> 39:25.240
Thanks, it means a lot.

39:27.143 --> 39:29.912
You wouldn't happen to know
who and where my father is.

39:30.947 --> 39:32.148
We're working on that.

39:34.249 --> 39:35.051
Don't worry.

39:36.052 --> 39:37.252
I'm sure he's out there.

39:42.058 --> 39:44.127
Can I ask you something?

39:44.160 --> 39:45.628
Sure.

39:45.661 --> 39:49.232
I lost my close friends,
Dr. Jansen lost her sister.

39:49.264 --> 39:52.468
But you, what did
they do to you?

39:52.502 --> 39:56.338
What could possibly be so
wrong that you can't share?

39:57.607 --> 39:59.742
That
doesn't matter now.

39:59.776 --> 40:00.843
It does to me.

40:00.877 --> 40:02.445
Why?

40:02.478 --> 40:05.581
Isn't avenging your
friends motivation enough?

40:05.615 --> 40:07.049
No, it's not.

40:08.951 --> 40:12.822
I love them, but I have to think

40:12.855 --> 40:15.124
that they're in a better place.

40:15.158 --> 40:19.262
If they were taken by
the Ash, they're not free.

40:19.294 --> 40:20.563
How do you know that?

40:22.198 --> 40:24.100
You're not ready yet.

40:24.133 --> 40:26.135
I believe in what
you're doing here.

40:26.169 --> 40:27.436
I just need to understand.

40:27.470 --> 40:28.971
I said you're not ready yet.

40:32.008 --> 40:36.445
But as I know you more, I am
confident you will be soon.

40:51.861 --> 40:53.162
Jim, Jim, Jim.

40:54.463 --> 40:55.264
Oh, Jim.

40:57.600 --> 40:58.401
Jim.

41:02.471 --> 41:04.006
People observing us.

41:04.040 --> 41:05.474
Can you hear what
they're saying?

41:06.676 --> 41:07.476
No.

41:08.444 --> 41:09.912
Talking about you.

41:09.946 --> 41:12.048
Seems to be
happening a lot lately.

41:12.081 --> 41:13.316
How can you trust them?

41:14.784 --> 41:16.252
They've given me
no reason not to.

41:16.285 --> 41:17.587
Is that all you got?

41:19.222 --> 41:20.056
Your opinion?

41:21.490 --> 41:23.392
What are you talking about?

41:23.426 --> 41:24.594
Look around you, Jim.

41:26.729 --> 41:28.464
The answer's right
in front of you.

41:43.412 --> 41:45.982
This
is getting us nowhere.

42:02.531 --> 42:05.635
seeing Angela and I
together must be hard.

42:05.668 --> 42:07.403
I'm gonna ask
Angela to marry me.

42:07.436 --> 42:09.405
- Seth.
- Try to get him back.

42:13.376 --> 42:16.779
He was about to
marry the love of your life.

42:16.812 --> 42:18.414
She's better off without me.

42:22.652 --> 42:24.320
Nothing can stop us.

42:30.126 --> 42:33.162
Did you even tell
Angela why you left?

42:33.195 --> 42:34.664
That you can't have kids?

42:35.932 --> 42:36.999
You're a coward, Jim.

43:34.023 --> 43:35.825
We plug into a
socket and the energy

43:35.858 --> 43:37.960
that flows out is blue.

43:37.994 --> 43:40.663
Why is the energy that
comes from the RUNTs orange?

43:40.696 --> 43:42.665
The orange energy
is like a filtered,

43:42.698 --> 43:45.901
lower energy than blue
energy, so you don't get hurt.

43:45.935 --> 43:48.804
If they were firing blue energy,
you would hurt a lot more.

43:48.838 --> 43:50.139
Trust me.

43:50.172 --> 43:51.441
You're an engineer, right?

43:51.475 --> 43:53.075
Is all energy the same?

43:53.109 --> 43:54.310
No, no, no, no, no.

43:54.343 --> 43:56.380
There's light energy,
heat, gravitational,

43:56.413 --> 44:00.816
mechanical, electrical, sound,
chemical, atomic, and so on.

44:00.850 --> 44:02.452
But that's not the question.

44:03.786 --> 44:05.788
Do you know what the
billion dollar question is?

44:05.821 --> 44:07.656
I don't know,
I failed physics.

44:07.690 --> 44:10.159
Aren't all Asians
good at physics?

44:10.192 --> 44:11.927
Is that the question?

44:11.961 --> 44:14.663
No, I was kidding.

44:14.697 --> 44:19.702
Okay, the real question is,
is not all energy the same,

44:20.870 --> 44:23.407
it's are these new
energies that we've

44:23.440 --> 44:24.573
never discovered before-

44:24.607 --> 44:25.941
- Can you stop
asking me questions?

44:25.975 --> 44:28.512
Okay, this energy
doesn't seem to flow

44:28.544 --> 44:30.846
from any traditional
power plant.

44:30.880 --> 44:32.915
It's not in any
of the textbooks.

44:32.948 --> 44:35.985
Now, Einstein said energy is
neither created nor destroyed.

44:36.018 --> 44:38.721
Then it had to have
come from somewhere.

44:38.754 --> 44:41.090
Where does the energy to
this building come from?

44:42.291 --> 44:44.693
I've never checked, but...

44:45.728 --> 44:47.563
It's gotta be
somewhere close, right?

44:53.903 --> 44:55.871
Hey, I'e checked all the
cameras for a generator room,

44:55.905 --> 44:57.973
- nothing's popping up.
- That's impossible.

44:58.007 --> 45:01.610
Well, a generator for this
size facility would be massive.

45:01.644 --> 45:04.046
This entire facility is
covered in security cameras.

45:04.080 --> 45:05.781
If it were here,
we would see it.

45:05.815 --> 45:08.084
Check the security
drawings, or maybe

45:08.117 --> 45:09.585
the power lines go somewhere.

45:11.287 --> 45:12.888
Okay, pulling it up.

45:15.124 --> 45:15.958
Nothing.

45:18.528 --> 45:19.628
That we can see.

45:21.531 --> 45:23.199
I mean, it wouldn't
be listed, right?

45:23.232 --> 45:24.066
Hold up.

45:25.601 --> 45:27.636
- What?
- Wait a second.

45:27.670 --> 45:29.271
There's a room where
all the power lines

45:29.305 --> 45:30.639
seem to feed into.

45:31.874 --> 45:33.142
Where?

45:33.175 --> 45:34.310
It's in the gauntlet.

45:35.277 --> 45:37.079
- You can't be serious.
- Yeah.

45:39.549 --> 45:40.383
She's right.

45:42.552 --> 45:43.719
How do we get there?

45:43.752 --> 45:45.888
Well, it's technically
near the exit, but-

45:45.921 --> 45:47.022
It's blocked.

45:47.056 --> 45:47.990
Sectioned off.

45:49.291 --> 45:50.659
According to the
gauntlet design schematics,

45:50.693 --> 45:53.095
these barriers will move
if we beat level eight.

45:54.263 --> 45:55.465
No one's ever
beat level eight.

45:55.499 --> 45:56.699
Captain Linden and his
team have come close.

45:56.732 --> 45:58.367
Yeah, the keyword's close.

46:01.270 --> 46:02.271
There's no way.

46:02.304 --> 46:04.206
- Just hear him out.
- Why?

46:05.341 --> 46:06.909
Let's say you can
infiltrate the tower.

46:06.942 --> 46:10.146
Get the map, relay the
codes, and diffuse the bomb.

46:10.179 --> 46:12.582
Do you even know what the pain
threshold is on level eight?

46:12.616 --> 46:13.716
I understand the risks.

46:13.749 --> 46:15.485
No you don't.

46:15.519 --> 46:17.686
On level eight, hardcore
mode is enabled.

46:17.720 --> 46:19.489
Which means anything
that can cause damage,

46:19.523 --> 46:21.924
like explosives or
ammo, could kill.

46:21.957 --> 46:24.827
That's why we never
train on level eight.

46:24.860 --> 46:26.695
Cap, listen, he's right.

46:26.729 --> 46:28.465
We never truly questioned the
way things work around here-

46:28.498 --> 46:30.467
- It's not our job
to question orders.

46:30.500 --> 46:31.867
It's not a job, Cap.

46:31.901 --> 46:33.669
Well, count me out.

46:33.702 --> 46:36.573
And consider yourself off my
team if you help these guys.

46:38.040 --> 46:38.874
Cap!

46:44.780 --> 46:46.849
Maybe you should
sit this one out.

46:49.685 --> 46:51.454
What are you talking about?

46:51.488 --> 46:52.321
I'm in.

46:55.024 --> 46:55.858
Excuse me.

46:58.160 --> 46:59.361
Cap.

46:59.396 --> 47:00.597
Cap!

47:00.630 --> 47:01.531
He's gonna get us
all killed, Bell.

47:01.565 --> 47:02.932
You don't know that.

47:02.965 --> 47:05.067
Do you remember what happened
last time we tried this?

47:05.100 --> 47:06.536
Yeah.

47:06.570 --> 47:08.938
He's not the first, he's
not gonna be the last.

47:08.971 --> 47:10.674
We have to give him a chance!

47:10.706 --> 47:12.475
I'm not losing another
person I care about-

47:12.509 --> 47:14.210
- You care?

47:14.243 --> 47:15.344
No one is gonna die!

47:15.377 --> 47:16.312
How do you know that?

47:16.345 --> 47:17.681
Because, he's....

47:21.850 --> 47:22.918
Don't let your
feelings for him-

47:22.952 --> 47:24.588
- Whoa.

47:24.621 --> 47:26.121
Feelings?

47:26.155 --> 47:26.989
Yeah.

47:28.123 --> 47:29.693
Who said anything
about feelings?

47:33.597 --> 47:35.064
Are you jealous?

47:36.198 --> 47:37.733
No.

47:37.766 --> 47:39.703
That's...

47:39.735 --> 47:40.769
Let's be clear.

47:42.371 --> 47:45.408
This is why we are all here.

47:45.442 --> 47:46.842
Okay?

47:46.875 --> 47:49.845
We tried before and now we
finally have a shot at answers.

47:49.878 --> 47:51.847
It's not happening, Bell.

48:02.626 --> 48:03.460
Okay guys.

48:04.394 --> 48:05.528
Level eight is booting.

48:06.696 --> 48:08.665
Hardcore mode enabled.

48:08.698 --> 48:12.334
Alert, game impacts
can be fatal.

48:13.436 --> 48:14.671
- So the tower?
- Mm-hmm.

48:14.704 --> 48:15.538
Yeah.

48:18.274 --> 48:20.042
So you were jealous.

48:20.075 --> 48:22.044
You're still off
the team after this.

48:24.780 --> 48:26.716
Okay, we go stealth on stage one

48:26.750 --> 48:28.250
and take the hill
that has the map.

48:28.284 --> 48:29.386
Jim, you're with me.

48:29.419 --> 48:30.319
Five.

48:30.352 --> 48:31.120
You three on the right.

48:31.153 --> 48:32.622
Four.

48:32.656 --> 48:33.456
Three.

48:34.323 --> 48:35.991
- Two.
- Copy that.

48:36.025 --> 48:37.694
- One.
- Game starting.

48:37.727 --> 48:38.827
Active.

48:56.413 --> 48:57.246
On you.

49:23.440 --> 49:24.674
Okay.

49:24.708 --> 49:27.142
Code room is in the
upper left quadrant.

49:27.176 --> 49:29.244
Bomb is located center right.

49:29.278 --> 49:30.747
Bell and Aaron,
head to the code room,

49:30.780 --> 49:32.047
Jim and I go to the
bomb for diffusing.

49:32.081 --> 49:32.915
- Got it.
- Go.

49:50.633 --> 49:52.702
You've been practicing.

49:52.736 --> 49:54.203
A little.

49:54.236 --> 49:56.038
You're doing great, guys.

50:06.716 --> 50:08.250
We're in.

50:10.820 --> 50:12.856
Okay guys, get on
decoding the module

50:12.888 --> 50:13.956
in order to diffuse the bomb.

50:13.989 --> 50:15.324
You got five minutes.

50:16.626 --> 50:18.695
You ready with
the codes, Aaron?

50:18.728 --> 50:19.562
Yep.

50:21.631 --> 50:22.465
Sigma.

50:25.802 --> 50:26.636
Four.

50:28.904 --> 50:29.739
Beta.

50:31.240 --> 50:32.040
Eight.

50:32.074 --> 50:32.908
That it?

50:34.477 --> 50:35.344
Almost there.

50:37.547 --> 50:38.448
What happened?

50:38.481 --> 50:40.215
You gave to the main symbol?

50:40.249 --> 50:41.917
Are you sure that was beta?

50:41.950 --> 50:44.153
I told you it
wasn't good at math.

50:44.186 --> 50:45.320
You said physics.

50:45.354 --> 50:46.823
Same thing!

50:46.856 --> 50:47.657
Get going, guys.

50:47.690 --> 50:48.924
Come on.

50:48.957 --> 50:49.958
Okay, let's move
on to wire cutting.

50:49.992 --> 50:51.260
That's our only way.

50:57.634 --> 50:58.435
A1.

51:00.035 --> 51:01.738
- Yes.
- One minute left.

51:01.771 --> 51:02.605
Hurry!

51:06.175 --> 51:07.309
Another wave coming.

51:07.342 --> 51:09.077
Let's get this.

51:10.279 --> 51:11.079
D2 to B3.

51:13.516 --> 51:14.417
D2 to B3.

51:15.819 --> 51:17.821
None of them are listed.

51:17.854 --> 51:20.457
That's exactly what
happened last time.

51:24.159 --> 51:25.994
Bell's hit.

51:26.028 --> 51:27.262
It's unbeatable.

51:27.296 --> 51:28.363
Abort mission.

51:28.398 --> 51:30.733
Billy, Aaron, get out of there.

51:30.767 --> 51:31.601
Let's go, Jim.

51:35.204 --> 51:36.706
Right behind you.

51:36.739 --> 51:40.643
They're not gonna make it.

51:53.021 --> 51:54.289
There's a 50-50 chance.

51:59.127 --> 52:00.362
Where's Jim?

52:00.396 --> 52:01.263
What are you doing?

52:01.296 --> 52:02.932
It's a 50-50 chance.

52:04.667 --> 52:07.403
Jim,
get out of there!

52:13.977 --> 52:15.845
What's wrong, Slim Jim?

52:15.879 --> 52:17.246
Didn't see my foot?

52:17.279 --> 52:19.782
Couldn't tell if your
eyes were open or not.

52:21.016 --> 52:22.184
Oh my god, you know,
for three seconds

52:22.217 --> 52:23.653
you were worth something.

52:23.686 --> 52:26.355
I'm sorry, I just can't
accept these grades, buddy.

52:26.389 --> 52:27.924
I think he shouldn't eat it.

52:27.957 --> 52:29.859
That's a brilliant idea.

52:29.893 --> 52:31.661
Should make him
eat all of them.

52:31.694 --> 52:33.128
Every F.

52:33.161 --> 52:35.732
Why you still down, boy?

52:35.765 --> 52:38.735
Thought you were born with
self-defense mechanisms.

52:41.103 --> 52:43.439
Do you think anyone
actually cares about you?

52:45.173 --> 52:47.376
The only reason you're
here is to fill the void

52:47.410 --> 52:49.278
for you're infertile
mommy and daddy.

53:09.866 --> 53:10.700
Very good, Jim.

53:11.601 --> 53:12.769
I thought I was dead.

53:14.169 --> 53:17.205
The bomb was merely to stun
you, as I had designed it.

53:17.239 --> 53:20.342
I'm sorry, the stakes
had to be high.

53:21.411 --> 53:23.646
- The team?
- Oh, they're fine.

53:23.680 --> 53:25.080
I've talked to them already.

53:26.315 --> 53:28.751
I never thought anybody
could beat level eight.

53:30.218 --> 53:31.821
Did they get to the generator?

53:33.288 --> 53:35.324
I assumed like
the others, you were

53:36.459 --> 53:38.494
only interested in
avenging your friends

53:41.731 --> 53:43.666
Because after my son died...

53:50.807 --> 53:52.107
He was a Navy SEAL.

53:53.643 --> 53:56.012
He hated everything I stood for.

53:56.579 --> 54:01.283
I never told him about
my dealings, but he knew.

54:05.354 --> 54:07.255
The Kinians asked
me to invite him

54:07.289 --> 54:09.626
to one of my vacation homes.

54:11.226 --> 54:15.230
He didn't want to visit
me, but I begged him.

54:18.501 --> 54:20.570
I thought they were
just gonna scare him.

54:22.071 --> 54:24.373
But they used the
red Ash on him,

54:24.407 --> 54:26.809
and it made him give
up all his intel.

54:28.478 --> 54:31.648
Names of undercover agents,
missions for the government,

54:31.681 --> 54:32.482
everything.

54:34.484 --> 54:35.952
Then they killed him.

54:38.688 --> 54:41.658
They said he was too
dangerous to keep alive.

54:44.661 --> 54:47.397
I myself was consumed
with revenge.

54:49.699 --> 54:53.235
But after a long spiritual
journey, I let go.

54:53.268 --> 54:56.472
And when I did,
that's when I realized

54:56.506 --> 54:59.174
the Ash with a human soul.

54:59.207 --> 55:01.376
That's where it gets its energy.

55:01.411 --> 55:05.715
The human soul is a life
force, regenerative.

55:05.748 --> 55:07.950
Can expand or contract.

55:09.385 --> 55:11.988
And one of the most
powerful energies we know.

55:13.923 --> 55:15.323
It can power this facility.

55:20.596 --> 55:23.599
Just 10 seconds of my
life energy, or mana,

55:25.001 --> 55:28.171
is enough to power this
facility for an entire day.

55:30.740 --> 55:34.644
You can power this
facility by yourself?

55:36.278 --> 55:39.281
Have you ever heard the term
ashes to ashes, dust to dust?

55:40.450 --> 55:42.217
How do you think the
Earth's population

55:42.250 --> 55:44.087
is able to continue to grow?

55:45.421 --> 55:47.657
When someone dies they're
supposed to return

55:47.690 --> 55:48.891
to a pool of mana.

55:48.925 --> 55:52.061
This facility is built
on top of a small pool.

55:52.095 --> 55:53.996
You are not consumed
with revenge.

55:54.030 --> 55:57.467
Rather, you are fueled with
purpose to help others.

56:00.703 --> 56:02.270
I'm no one.

56:02.304 --> 56:04.507
Ah, you are more than that.

56:06.308 --> 56:09.812
And I will help you achieve
your true potential.

56:13.049 --> 56:14.484
Place your hand there.

56:24.060 --> 56:24.961
It's there, Jim.

56:27.130 --> 56:30.233
Through training with
me, you will learn.

56:37.507 --> 56:38.340
Breathe.

56:41.811 --> 56:43.246
To be selfless...

56:47.150 --> 56:49.652
One must trust others.

56:49.685 --> 56:52.655
So it's not a big machine
powering this place?

56:52.688 --> 56:53.523
Far from it.

57:04.000 --> 57:04.834
Again.

57:06.269 --> 57:07.537
But first...

57:13.209 --> 57:14.010
Nice.

57:14.043 --> 57:14.877
Good.

57:15.945 --> 57:17.413
Bell, you're up next.

57:17.446 --> 57:18.313
Choose a partner.

57:20.216 --> 57:21.851
I choose Jim.

57:21.884 --> 57:22.718
What?

57:28.624 --> 57:30.059
I don't want to hit a...

57:31.727 --> 57:32.562
Girl?

57:34.564 --> 57:36.566
You must trust yourself.

57:38.501 --> 57:40.102
What if it wasn't just any girl?

57:40.136 --> 57:41.137
All right.

57:43.172 --> 57:44.841
What if it was
your girlfriend?

57:49.278 --> 57:51.914
Now let's do one, two.

57:51.948 --> 57:54.717
Slip, uppercut, bam,
blow underneath.

57:54.750 --> 57:55.585
Left hook.

57:57.453 --> 57:59.021
To be selfless...

58:00.756 --> 58:02.859
Is to give of oneself.

58:02.892 --> 58:05.561
Wanna think of
turning the hip over,

58:05.595 --> 58:07.797
keeping that knee
parallel to the ground

58:07.830 --> 58:08.998
as you swing and kick.

58:09.031 --> 58:09.866
Let me see it.

58:12.602 --> 58:14.003
Wholeheartedly.

58:23.913 --> 58:25.414
You're getting it.

58:26.482 --> 58:27.316
Yeah.

58:32.121 --> 58:33.856
What do you think?

58:33.890 --> 58:36.225
He's the best we
could have hoped for.

58:36.259 --> 58:37.693
Dedicated.

58:37.727 --> 58:39.328
Driven.

58:39.362 --> 58:41.030
I worry it's not enough.

58:42.798 --> 58:45.568
If he's
anything like you...

58:45.601 --> 58:48.638
We should keep testing
him, pushing his limits.

58:48.671 --> 58:49.605
See what...

58:50.539 --> 58:51.407
I understand.

58:52.575 --> 58:55.778
But knowing more can have a
huge impact on Project Alpha.

58:56.545 --> 58:58.614
That meditation stuff.

58:59.749 --> 59:01.617
It's never going to work.

59:03.052 --> 59:05.821
I need more lab resources
to do the genetic analysis.

59:05.855 --> 59:08.624
It can't just pay me in
some new doctor doing it.

59:11.427 --> 59:13.362
Look at this place,
it's falling apart.

59:20.836 --> 59:25.541
Do you think it's easy
funding an operation like this?

59:25.574 --> 59:28.144
There are forces that are
freezing my bank accounts.

59:28.177 --> 59:31.914
I need to offshore my finances,
and cannot be detected.

59:31.948 --> 59:35.385
When's the last time that you
had to think about funding?

59:35.419 --> 59:36.819
You think it just happens?

59:38.154 --> 59:40.589
People take this for
granted, but it's a process,

59:40.623 --> 59:44.694
and there are limits so
we can remain undetected.

59:47.596 --> 59:48.432
Yes, sir.

59:56.038 --> 59:58.240
I cannot believe that you
got them to deliver this

59:58.274 --> 59:59.542
all the way out here.

59:59.575 --> 1:00:00.743
- What?
- Yeah.

1:00:00.776 --> 1:00:01.677
You're amazing.

1:00:03.879 --> 1:00:06.615
The guy definitely
got a big tip.

1:00:07.451 --> 1:00:08.284
Good.

1:00:23.499 --> 1:00:24.333
He loved you.

1:00:27.670 --> 1:00:29.772
I just wish she hadn't
wanted to visit me.

1:00:35.511 --> 1:00:37.279
It was my fault.

1:00:37.313 --> 1:00:40.116
I kept talking
about you so much.

1:00:40.149 --> 1:00:42.419
He practically planned
the whole trip for me.

1:00:44.421 --> 1:00:46.222
Why'd you leave, Jim?

1:00:47.723 --> 1:00:49.125
Was it 'cause of my job?

1:00:49.158 --> 1:00:51.927
I know that I can get
consumed with work sometimes.

1:00:51.961 --> 1:00:53.329
No.

1:00:53.362 --> 1:00:54.431
No, no, it was...

1:00:56.032 --> 1:00:59.101
I love every part
of that about you.

1:00:59.135 --> 1:01:01.237
You'd come home
from the hospital,

1:01:01.270 --> 1:01:02.905
talking about delivering babies.

1:01:06.208 --> 1:01:09.879
Made me want to
be a good person.

1:01:09.912 --> 1:01:11.781
You are a good person.

1:01:11.814 --> 1:01:12.648
No I'm not.

1:01:15.785 --> 1:01:16.786
Not if I hurt you.

1:01:18.320 --> 1:01:19.655
You'd never hurt me.

1:01:25.561 --> 1:01:27.763
I can't have children, Ange.

1:01:29.999 --> 1:01:30.833
So?

1:01:31.734 --> 1:01:34.136
So, you love children.

1:01:36.038 --> 1:01:37.407
We could adopt.

1:01:40.176 --> 1:01:41.411
And what?

1:01:41.445 --> 1:01:42.978
Do you know what it was
like for me growing up?

1:01:43.012 --> 1:01:43.913
How can I?

1:01:43.946 --> 1:01:45.382
You never talked to me about it.

1:01:45.415 --> 1:01:46.615
You don't want to hear it.

1:01:46.649 --> 1:01:48.150
Why are you always
trying to protect me?

1:01:48.184 --> 1:01:50.786
'Cause no one protected me
when I was growing up, okay?

1:01:50.820 --> 1:01:52.221
My adoptive parents?

1:01:54.090 --> 1:01:57.593
When they had to bail me out
jail, they gave up on me.

1:02:02.164 --> 1:02:06.436
Do you know what it's like
to be abandoned twice?

1:02:06.470 --> 1:02:07.269
Come here.

1:02:12.542 --> 1:02:15.077
There's nothing you
could ever tell me

1:02:16.580 --> 1:02:18.681
that would make me
abandon you, okay?

1:02:34.330 --> 1:02:35.164
Jim.

1:02:36.198 --> 1:02:37.567
How's Angela?

1:02:37.601 --> 1:02:38.535
She's fine.

1:02:40.369 --> 1:02:41.737
She's your weakness, Jim.

1:02:43.540 --> 1:02:44.608
How so?

1:02:44.640 --> 1:02:45.808
Because you care.

1:02:49.945 --> 1:02:50.813
What about you?

1:02:52.482 --> 1:02:53.916
You still care about anybody?

1:02:55.885 --> 1:02:56.952
Not even your wife?

1:03:01.023 --> 1:03:01.824
Your son?

1:03:03.692 --> 1:03:04.494
No.

1:03:05.961 --> 1:03:07.029
You sure?

1:03:07.062 --> 1:03:07.930
What was his name?

1:03:12.701 --> 1:03:13.537
No.

1:03:15.004 --> 1:03:17.072
- What about your son, John?
- No.

1:03:17.106 --> 1:03:20.410
Shut up!

1:03:20.443 --> 1:03:22.111
What about him?

1:03:22.144 --> 1:03:22.978
Shut up!

1:03:24.046 --> 1:03:24.847
Shut up.

1:03:24.880 --> 1:03:26.550
What about your son?

1:03:26.583 --> 1:03:27.384
No.

1:03:34.757 --> 1:03:36.058
What abt your son!

1:03:42.666 --> 1:03:43.832
Jim.

1:03:43.866 --> 1:03:45.468
You have to find a
way to reach me, okay?

1:03:45.502 --> 1:03:46.302
John.

1:03:48.471 --> 1:03:49.772
John.

1:03:56.845 --> 1:03:59.949
This is crazy and dangerous.

1:03:59.982 --> 1:04:02.586
Can we at least wait
a day or two for this?

1:04:02.619 --> 1:04:03.886
Let's run more tests.

1:04:03.919 --> 1:04:05.321
See what our options are.

1:04:05.354 --> 1:04:07.156
I'm not sure if
John can hold out.

1:04:09.392 --> 1:04:10.493
We should keep going.

1:04:12.161 --> 1:04:14.730
Alastair, we don't know
what's on the other side.

1:04:15.965 --> 1:04:16.932
He could die.

1:04:21.504 --> 1:04:23.473
Jim, it's not worth it.

1:04:27.677 --> 1:04:28.511
Alastair.

1:04:34.083 --> 1:04:35.050
What do you need?

1:04:36.285 --> 1:04:39.054
To be selfless is
to trust oneself.

1:04:47.796 --> 1:04:49.298
He's ready.

1:04:52.469 --> 1:04:53.302
Good luck.

1:05:13.757 --> 1:05:15.057
I'm sorry, I didn't order any.

1:05:15.090 --> 1:05:15.991
It's on the house.

1:05:16.025 --> 1:05:17.026
You look like you need it.

1:05:17.960 --> 1:05:18.794
Thank you.

1:05:21.464 --> 1:05:22.699
We're in the same school.

1:05:23.832 --> 1:05:24.734
Yeah.

1:05:24.768 --> 1:05:25.568
We're in the same math class.

1:05:25.602 --> 1:05:27.069
Mr. Jenkins's class.

1:05:27.102 --> 1:05:30.172
I'm always in the back,
you're always in the front.

1:05:30.205 --> 1:05:32.609
Otherwise you'd
probably recognize me.

1:05:32.642 --> 1:05:33.777
Oh, I recognize you.

1:05:35.679 --> 1:05:36.680
Do you work here?

1:05:38.180 --> 1:05:38.947
What am I saying?

1:05:38.981 --> 1:05:39.882
Of course you do.

1:05:39.915 --> 1:05:40.816
I'm saving up to go to college

1:05:40.849 --> 1:05:42.519
and then go to medical school.

1:05:42.552 --> 1:05:43.952
Why?

1:05:43.986 --> 1:05:46.021
I mean, these days it's
better to work on Wall Street

1:05:46.055 --> 1:05:47.923
and make a lot of money.

1:05:47.956 --> 1:05:49.392
Doctors don't
make a lot of money

1:05:49.426 --> 1:05:51.795
for the years they put in,
but you can't put a price tag

1:05:51.827 --> 1:05:53.463
on helping a mother and
father bring a new life

1:05:53.496 --> 1:05:54.830
into this world.

1:05:54.863 --> 1:05:57.734
I wouldn't know what it's like

1:05:57.767 --> 1:05:59.703
to have a mother and father.

1:05:59.736 --> 1:06:01.471
I'm sorry.

1:06:01.504 --> 1:06:04.641
How do you know that you
want to become a doctor?

1:06:05.508 --> 1:06:06.776
I just told you.

1:06:06.810 --> 1:06:10.447
But how did you start?

1:06:11.347 --> 1:06:12.147
Babysitting.

1:06:12.181 --> 1:06:14.551
Not kids, but babies.

1:06:14.584 --> 1:06:15.385
Really?

1:06:15.418 --> 1:06:16.218
Really.

1:06:16.251 --> 1:06:17.687
Like what?

1:06:17.721 --> 1:06:20.055
Like everything, you know,
that they're so helpless

1:06:20.089 --> 1:06:22.124
and all they want is your love.

1:06:22.157 --> 1:06:23.626
They know nothing else.

1:06:23.660 --> 1:06:25.260
They've yet to know about
all the things in life,

1:06:25.294 --> 1:06:28.431
like fancy cars,
big house, you know,

1:06:28.465 --> 1:06:31.266
none of which will
make you truly happy.

1:06:31.300 --> 1:06:32.736
It's a gift to care for a baby

1:06:32.769 --> 1:06:34.838
because you have to be selfless.

1:06:34.870 --> 1:06:37.774
You can't at any point
just stop caring for one.

1:06:40.477 --> 1:06:41.944
So you wanna be a doctor now?

1:06:42.779 --> 1:06:44.346
No, but thank you.

1:06:45.615 --> 1:06:47.617
Maybe I'll find
something to do someday.

1:06:48.785 --> 1:06:49.619
Just like you.

1:06:50.919 --> 1:06:51.755
You will.

1:07:07.704 --> 1:07:09.004
You have to be selfless.

1:07:10.205 --> 1:07:13.208
Maybe I'll find
something to do someday.

1:07:13.242 --> 1:07:14.076
Like you.

1:07:40.870 --> 1:07:42.271
I've been waiting for you.

1:07:44.741 --> 1:07:45.675
Where are we?

1:07:47.976 --> 1:07:48.812
I don't know.

1:07:50.279 --> 1:07:51.681
My soul.

1:07:51.714 --> 1:07:52.549
My mind.

1:07:53.949 --> 1:07:54.751
A little bit of both.

1:07:54.784 --> 1:07:55.752
I'm not quite sure.

1:07:59.556 --> 1:08:01.190
We used to take my son here.

1:08:06.696 --> 1:08:07.630
It's beautiful.

1:08:08.832 --> 1:08:10.365
Ah.

1:08:10.400 --> 1:08:11.634
You're in my house now.

1:08:13.636 --> 1:08:15.337
I wouldn't show you
the garage first.

1:08:21.109 --> 1:08:22.779
What do we do now?

1:08:24.747 --> 1:08:26.014
I don't know.

1:08:27.383 --> 1:08:32.221
But what I do know is that
selflessness is to trust others.

1:08:45.334 --> 1:08:46.569
So trust Alastair.

1:08:47.570 --> 1:08:48.438
Hey Jim.

1:08:50.607 --> 1:08:52.007
Tell my son I love him.

1:09:44.827 --> 1:09:45.628
You're fine.

1:09:49.399 --> 1:09:50.800
I'm sorry about this, Jim.

1:09:52.468 --> 1:09:53.803
Let's see if this kills you.

1:10:55.798 --> 1:10:56.866
Seth?

1:11:12.615 --> 1:11:13.883
Send me back.

1:11:15.350 --> 1:11:16.184
Where?

1:11:31.299 --> 1:11:32.502
What else did you see?

1:11:34.336 --> 1:11:35.872
The mana.

1:11:35.905 --> 1:11:37.607
They want all of Earth's mana.

1:11:41.511 --> 1:11:42.344
Here.

1:11:44.013 --> 1:11:44.914
Take this.

1:11:48.418 --> 1:11:49.385
It belonged to him.

1:11:52.287 --> 1:11:53.823
He was a great warrior.

1:11:55.091 --> 1:11:56.224
And a great man.

1:11:59.462 --> 1:12:00.596
Just like you.

1:12:00.630 --> 1:12:02.297
We're getting you outta here.

1:12:02.330 --> 1:12:03.298
No, it's too late.

1:12:05.735 --> 1:12:06.602
There's so much...

1:12:24.454 --> 1:12:25.455
Thank you.

1:12:34.262 --> 1:12:35.765
The RUNTs.

1:12:35.798 --> 1:12:37.033
They've gone berserk.

1:12:37.066 --> 1:12:39.602
She's reprogrammed
them to kill humans.

1:12:39.635 --> 1:12:42.237
I was just at the
main exit, it's blocked.

1:12:42.270 --> 1:12:44.040
We should move for
Alastair's ship, then.

1:12:44.073 --> 1:12:44.907
Where's Angela?

1:12:47.877 --> 1:12:49.212
She's trapped in the lab.

1:12:50.345 --> 1:12:51.681
I gotta get to her.

1:12:51.714 --> 1:12:53.248
No, there's no time.

1:12:53.281 --> 1:12:54.884
Leave without me
if I don't make it.

1:12:54.917 --> 1:12:55.752
You'll make it.

1:12:59.789 --> 1:13:00.823
We'll wait for you.

1:13:01.758 --> 1:13:03.258
Let's go.

1:13:03.291 --> 1:13:04.093
Here.

1:13:05.495 --> 1:13:06.529
So you can find us.

1:13:26.314 --> 1:13:27.917
Alastair is dead.

1:13:27.950 --> 1:13:28.951
Well done.

1:13:30.186 --> 1:13:31.053
My sister.

1:13:33.189 --> 1:13:34.023
She's here.

1:13:38.161 --> 1:13:39.428
Where is she?

1:13:40.730 --> 1:13:42.832
Come, I'll show you.

1:13:42.865 --> 1:13:44.467
No no, no!

1:13:51.774 --> 1:13:53.843
Now we are one.

1:14:33.916 --> 1:14:35.084
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1:14:39.322 --> 1:14:40.756
I got your six.

1:15:01.510 --> 1:15:02.445
Angela?

1:15:02.478 --> 1:15:04.013
Jim?

1:15:04.046 --> 1:15:04.914
- Angela!
- Jim!

1:15:08.150 --> 1:15:08.951
Are you okay?

1:15:08.985 --> 1:15:10.086
I'm fine.

1:15:17.860 --> 1:15:20.329
Now who's in control, Jim.

1:15:25.268 --> 1:15:26.369
You're pathetic.

1:15:29.238 --> 1:15:31.941
I did love you, too much.

1:15:33.576 --> 1:15:35.778
That's what made me weak.

1:15:35.811 --> 1:15:37.947
Now I'm stronger.

1:15:39.916 --> 1:15:40.750
I'm better.

1:15:45.087 --> 1:15:46.255
Angela.

1:16:08.210 --> 1:16:10.313
Isolation
chamber activated.

1:16:10.346 --> 1:16:13.749
Danger, decontamination
process commencing.

1:16:32.501 --> 1:16:33.302
Angela.

1:16:34.670 --> 1:16:35.604
What are you doing?

1:16:35.638 --> 1:16:36.605
No, Jim.

1:16:42.678 --> 1:16:43.512
Go.

1:16:45.081 --> 1:16:46.082
No.

1:16:46.115 --> 1:16:46.949
Go!

1:16:48.084 --> 1:16:49.485
I love you.

1:16:49.518 --> 1:16:50.353
Oh, please.

1:16:52.188 --> 1:16:53.390
Don't do this.

1:16:53.423 --> 1:16:54.890
We are
in control, Jim.

1:17:05.501 --> 1:17:07.103
Not working!

1:17:07.136 --> 1:17:07.970
Moving!

1:17:10.474 --> 1:17:11.240
On the right!

1:17:12.608 --> 1:17:16.679
In lockdown.

1:17:19.648 --> 1:17:20.883
Jim, what's your location?

1:17:20.916 --> 1:17:21.817
We're pinned down.

1:17:23.285 --> 1:17:25.321
Jim, what's your con?

1:17:34.163 --> 1:17:35.331
Come on, come on.

1:17:35.364 --> 1:17:36.265
I can't hold
them off forever.

1:17:36.298 --> 1:17:37.501
We're gonna get pinned!

1:18:53.175 --> 1:18:54.610
On your five, on your five.

1:18:58.347 --> 1:18:59.648
- Higgins.
- Huh?

1:18:59.682 --> 1:19:02.651
Can you cut through this?

1:19:02.685 --> 1:19:03.619
No problem.

1:19:03.652 --> 1:19:04.653
I'm on it.

1:20:04.346 --> 1:20:08.451
They keep coming!

1:20:10.986 --> 1:20:12.721
That can't be good.

1:20:14.857 --> 1:20:17.193
There are too many!

1:20:28.605 --> 1:20:29.439
Yes.

1:20:34.109 --> 1:20:35.277
Door open.

1:20:35.311 --> 1:20:36.513
Guys, come on,
come on, let's go.

1:20:36.546 --> 1:20:37.447
Move it.

1:20:37.480 --> 1:20:40.149
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

1:20:41.116 --> 1:20:42.686
A simple thank you...

1:21:02.771 --> 1:21:04.240
Where are the controls?

1:21:04.273 --> 1:21:06.710
I don't know, you think
they'd have a manual.

1:21:06.742 --> 1:21:07.677
Figure it out.

1:21:07.711 --> 1:21:08.844
We're going back for Jim.

1:21:11.847 --> 1:21:14.183
I've been waiting for you.

1:21:22.726 --> 1:21:25.528
- I'm impressed.
- I'm just getting started.

1:21:31.233 --> 1:21:35.804
Before we left Earth, we
killed all the half-Kinians.

1:21:37.607 --> 1:21:39.676
At least I thought we did.

1:21:39.709 --> 1:21:40.510
What?

1:21:40.543 --> 1:21:41.777
Yes.

1:21:41.810 --> 1:21:42.778
You didn't sense it?

1:21:42.811 --> 1:21:43.647
No.

1:21:46.449 --> 1:21:48.385
That's how you
can resist the Ash.

1:21:49.653 --> 1:21:53.889
Humans are much more
easily manipulated.

1:22:00.597 --> 1:22:01.531
Look at Angela.

1:22:02.732 --> 1:22:05.100
Her mind defied
the Ash's control.

1:22:08.370 --> 1:22:11.641
But love has no stamina.

1:22:15.612 --> 1:22:17.313
It's so very...

1:22:24.454 --> 1:22:25.287
Delicate.

1:22:27.823 --> 1:22:28.725
Go for the hand.

1:22:30.727 --> 1:22:32.662
When we built
the Ash, we focused

1:22:32.696 --> 1:22:34.631
on harnessing human greed.

1:22:36.800 --> 1:22:37.634
Enhancing it.

1:22:39.101 --> 1:22:40.804
Utilizing hate.

1:22:41.837 --> 1:22:44.840
Fear and anger.

1:22:44.873 --> 1:22:47.343
Emotions more accessible.

1:22:53.583 --> 1:22:55.685
I've had enough hate
and anger in my life.

1:22:55.719 --> 1:22:57.554
Never solved any of my problems.

1:22:59.922 --> 1:23:01.825
Sacrifice.

1:23:04.159 --> 1:23:04.960
Love.

1:23:07.963 --> 1:23:09.231
Selflessness.

1:23:12.267 --> 1:23:14.069
That's when I turned
my life around.

1:23:16.706 --> 1:23:17.873
That's when I had hope.

1:23:19.542 --> 1:23:24.213
And I'm never going back.

1:23:34.391 --> 1:23:36.291
- Jim!
- Jim, over here!

1:23:38.695 --> 1:23:40.129
There's gotta be a computer.

1:23:40.162 --> 1:23:41.130
Hello.

1:23:42.699 --> 1:23:43.666
That's your name?

1:23:44.501 --> 1:23:45.502
Computer?

1:23:45.535 --> 1:23:46.870
Yes.

1:23:46.935 --> 1:23:48.904
Okay, we're gonna
have to change that.

1:23:50.707 --> 1:23:51.541
Okay.

1:23:52.941 --> 1:23:53.843
Now we're talking.

1:23:55.310 --> 1:23:56.111
I can do this.

1:23:56.145 --> 1:23:56.979
Oh, don't touch that.

1:23:59.416 --> 1:24:00.249
Let's go.

1:24:06.221 --> 1:24:07.624
Took you long enough.

1:24:07.657 --> 1:24:09.526
Computer, start the engines.

1:24:09.559 --> 1:24:10.660
Starting engines.

1:24:10.693 --> 1:24:12.529
- Okay.
- Where to?

1:24:13.962 --> 1:24:16.900
Take us to where
Alastair wants us to go.

1:24:16.932 --> 1:24:17.834
Affirmative.

1:24:22.672 --> 1:24:24.306
How'd you know
to hit the hand?

1:24:25.974 --> 1:24:27.877
Oh, you can thank
Bell for that.

1:24:27.911 --> 1:24:29.446
Take off in three.

1:24:29.479 --> 1:24:30.747
- Lucky guess.
- Two.

1:24:31.648 --> 1:24:32.849
One.

1:24:32.882 --> 1:24:34.183
Engage.
