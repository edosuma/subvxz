*********

00:06.150 --> 00:10.490
30 days has September,
all the rest have 31,

00:10.500 --> 00:13.830
except for Judith, who has 28.

00:14.580 --> 00:17.520
Hey, Alan. Meet Don.

00:17.530 --> 00:18.550
Hello, Don.

00:18.560 --> 00:20.660
Hello, Alan.

00:21.410 --> 00:24.800
Don drove me home and
I don't have any money.

00:24.810 --> 00:26.880
Okay, uh, is Don a cabbie?

00:26.890 --> 00:32.060
No, no. Don is a close, personal friend.

00:32.560 --> 00:37.370
Don is a cabbie. He has enough
friends, and he wants his $80.

00:37.380 --> 00:38.810
What happened to your money?

00:38.820 --> 00:40.490
Good question.

00:40.520 --> 00:46.030
You know how easy Texas Hold 'Em looks on TV
when you can see the other guys' hole cards?

00:46.040 --> 00:46.730
Yeah.

00:46.740 --> 00:49.710
Very different in real life.

00:51.190 --> 00:55.890
Uh, 20, 40, 60, 80.

00:57.550 --> 00:59.780
No tip?

01:00.150 --> 01:02.070
Hold on.

01:02.080 --> 01:05.740
Let's see, five dollars...

01:05.750 --> 01:09.750
Keep your money, Mr. Trump
You need it more than I do.

01:11.360 --> 01:13.090
Are we still on for lunch?

01:19.930 --> 01:22.630
I think you offended Don.

01:22.640 --> 01:25.000
He'll get over it. Where's your car?

01:25.010 --> 01:29.280
Don't change the subject.
You owe Don an apology.

01:30.270 --> 01:33.240
- Oh, hey, a calendar.
- Yeah.

01:33.250 --> 01:38.040
- What's "JMC" stand for?
- Nothing.

01:38.050 --> 01:42.140
Oh, come on. John Mellencamp Cougar?

01:42.720 --> 01:44.140
No.

01:44.150 --> 01:47.950
Jumping Methodist... cougar?

01:48.620 --> 01:49.880
No.

01:49.890 --> 01:51.640
Then I give up.

01:51.650 --> 01:55.880
Well, if you must know, it stands
for "Judith's menstrual cycle."

02:00.030 --> 02:01.620
Get out.

02:01.630 --> 02:05.340
No, look. This is when
Judith and Herb broke up.

02:05.350 --> 02:08.669
And this is the day
that I had sex with her.

02:08.680 --> 02:12.930
Dude... you need a better hobby.

02:13.550 --> 02:16.640
Judith is now five months pregnant.

02:16.660 --> 02:18.750
Oh, yeah, right.

02:18.760 --> 02:24.400
She's probably in that sweet spot where her boobs
are big and cushy but her ass is still normal.

02:24.970 --> 02:29.470
Charlie, it is almost certain that
I am the father of Judith's baby.

02:29.480 --> 02:31.840
Are you still grinding on this?

02:31.860 --> 02:34.510
What if it's a girl? I
always wanted a daughter.

02:34.520 --> 02:38.230
I finally get one and some
other guy gets to be her dad.

02:38.240 --> 02:42.290
I feel like the universe is playing
some horrible practical joke on me.

02:43.590 --> 02:47.070
I lost $8,000 playing poker.

02:47.080 --> 02:52.820
I have no idea where my car is,
threw up in my mouth three times,

02:52.830 --> 02:56.490
and I'm still having a
better night than you are.

02:57.370 --> 02:59.080
I don't expect you to understand.

02:59.100 --> 03:01.200
You don't know the
joy of being a parent.

03:01.220 --> 03:07.280
Of watching a part of you grow and develop,
blooming into a fully formed human being.

03:31.730 --> 03:34.220
Jake, your father's here.

03:35.040 --> 03:37.190
- So, how you doing?
- Good.

03:37.200 --> 03:39.770
- Over the morning sickness?
- Yes, Alan.

03:39.780 --> 03:44.550
Uh, by my calculations probably
about a week, ten days ago?

03:44.560 --> 03:45.830
That sounds right.

03:45.850 --> 03:50.450
Good, good. You have a nice break till the,
uh, till the old hemorrhoids come a-callin'.

03:50.690 --> 03:52.800
Jake1

03:54.230 --> 03:57.480
Judith, are we gonna talk
about the elephant in the room?

03:57.500 --> 03:58.760
What elephant?

03:58.790 --> 04:01.520
Come on, you, me, the baby?

04:01.540 --> 04:05.640
- I mean, we did have unprotected sex...
- You shut your mouth. We did not.

04:05.650 --> 04:06.160
Yes, we did.

04:06.170 --> 04:09.200
Read my lips. We did not have sex.

04:09.210 --> 04:10.980
Oh, hey, Alan. How goes it?

04:10.990 --> 04:13.090
Oh, uh, fine, Herb. Uh, how you doing?

04:13.100 --> 04:14.680
Proud as a peacock.

04:14.690 --> 04:16.940
- Honey, did you show him the sonogram?
- No.

04:16.950 --> 04:20.149
- Oh, you should see her, Alan.
- Her? So, it is a girl?

04:20.160 --> 04:23.900
Yep, one fresh-faced
little fetus sans wee-wee.

04:25.040 --> 04:27.880
I always wanted a sans wee-wee.

04:27.890 --> 04:29.750
Well, you can't have mine.

04:29.760 --> 04:31.650
No, no, of course not.

04:31.660 --> 04:33.310
Hey, wanna see how we're
decorating the nursery?

04:33.320 --> 04:34.610
He doesn't wanna see the nursery, Herb.

04:34.620 --> 04:37.620
Sure I would. You going with
mermaids? Little girls love mermaids.

04:37.630 --> 04:39.610
Actually, I was thinking little ponies.

04:39.620 --> 04:41.390
- Little ponies?
- Yeah, why?

04:41.400 --> 04:45.570
Oh, gosh... Little ponies
have little penises.

04:46.060 --> 04:48.820
Really? I didn't notice
that on the stencils.

04:48.830 --> 04:51.210
- Let's go take look.
- I'm ready.

04:51.220 --> 04:54.080
Oh, uh, I'll be right back. I'm
just going to go see the baby's room.

04:54.090 --> 04:55.580
He never wants to see my room.

04:55.590 --> 04:58.340
That's because your room is a pig sty.

04:58.350 --> 05:01.000
I didn't ask for a reason.

05:07.460 --> 05:11.340
Alan, buddy, I'm getting a little
concerned about your drinking.

05:11.350 --> 05:12.780
I don't have a problem.

05:12.790 --> 05:16.660
Well, I do. You're
swillin' my good stuff.

05:17.690 --> 05:21.920
Here. Have some Old Wal-Mart.

05:23.940 --> 05:25.910
Thank you.

05:26.510 --> 05:27.420
What's this?

05:27.430 --> 05:30.100
Ugh, a diary I kept
during Judith's pregnancy.

05:30.120 --> 05:33.310
Jennifer, Jocelyn, Jasmine, Jolene?

05:33.320 --> 05:36.930
Some of the names that we picked
out in case Jake had been a girl.

05:36.960 --> 05:40.690
Oh, man, can you imagine him as a chick?

05:41.060 --> 05:42.990
Woof1

05:44.260 --> 05:46.730
Yeah, well, that's
not how it turned out.

05:46.750 --> 05:47.860
Think about it though.

05:47.870 --> 05:51.800
Every weekend, me, you and a
big ugly girl with a bad haircut.

05:52.860 --> 05:54.640
I'm gonna have a daughter, Charlie.

05:54.650 --> 05:58.880
Okay, okay, first of all,
you don't know it's your kid.

05:58.890 --> 06:02.890
All we know is that when Judith
and Herb broke up you nailed Judith.

06:02.910 --> 06:05.380
Then when they reconciled,
Herb nailed Judith.

06:05.420 --> 06:10.570
So, the only thing we know for sure is that
despite all outward appearances, Judith is a slut.

06:11.290 --> 06:14.500
Hey, I'm aware that technically
either one of us could be the father,

06:14.520 --> 06:18.340
but I know in my gut that
this is my sweet bastard child.

06:18.350 --> 06:20.320
You don't know squat.

06:20.330 --> 06:22.770
And you wanna talk technically?

06:22.780 --> 06:26.570
Technically, maybe neither
one of you is the father.

06:26.590 --> 06:29.100
Oh, dear God, Charlie.
What have you done?

06:29.640 --> 06:31.760
Not me, you fool.

06:31.770 --> 06:34.750
- Although if I had known she was that easy, may...
- Stop1

06:35.260 --> 06:38.220
All I'm saying is there could very
well be some guy in her driveway

06:38.230 --> 06:41.820
with a leaf blower pining
away for "baby Juanita."

06:41.830 --> 06:45.550
That's just ridiculous. Judith
won't even eat Mexican food.

06:45.930 --> 06:51.340
Look, even if you're right, doing anything
about it, it's just gonna destroy a marriage.

06:51.350 --> 06:55.120
I know, I know. It's just... it's so
hard to ignore my paternal instincts.

06:55.130 --> 06:59.850
Sure, I see those instincts
with Jake and I admire them.

06:59.870 --> 07:04.290
If I was his dad, I would've dropped him off at
an orphanage with 20 bucks and a bag of doughnuts.

07:04.640 --> 07:07.320
No, you wouldn't. He was
adorable when he was a baby.

07:07.330 --> 07:10.990
Baby? I'm lking about last week.

07:12.920 --> 07:17.200
I walked into his room. He was
trying to bite his toenails.

07:17.700 --> 07:21.090
Let's be honest. That's monkey behavior.

07:21.420 --> 07:22.910
son inot a monkey.

07:22.940 --> 07:25.880
My point here is, rget the baby.

07:25.900 --> 07:29.250
- You've already got a kid to raise.
- Yeah, I guess.

07:38.350 --> 07:41.040
He's not a monkey.

07:46.500 --> 07:48.870
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing?

07:48.880 --> 07:50.640
I don't wanna watch football.

07:50.650 --> 07:53.120
Nobody cares what you wanna watch.

07:53.140 --> 07:55.660
Why do you get to decide
evything around here?

07:55.680 --> 07:56.540
Oh, I don't know.

07:56.550 --> 07:59.220
Maybe it's because I bought
everything around here.

07:59.230 --> 08:02.000
Oh, right, play the money
card. That's all you got.

08:02.010 --> 08:05.760
That's all I need. Now shut up.

08:06.830 --> 08:09.470
No, you shut up.

08:12.590 --> 08:17.540
All right, I'm gonna count to three
and then I'm gonna kick your ass.

08:18.120 --> 08:20.860
Ooh, I'm scared.

08:21.080 --> 08:24.250
One. Two.

08:24.260 --> 08:27.190
I'm only leaving 'cause I'm bored.

08:28.810 --> 08:31.870
He keeps growing, I'm screwed.

08:32.590 --> 08:35.559
Hey, hey, uh, you wanna hear what
I wrote the night you were born?

08:35.590 --> 08:37.330
Not really.

08:37.350 --> 08:40.280
Oh, come on. Come on. Uh,
sit down. You'll like it.

08:42.130 --> 08:45.320
It's kind of a poem.

08:45.330 --> 08:48.810
"My son, my son, my only one.

08:48.840 --> 08:51.840
You open my heart like the morning sun."

08:51.860 --> 08:54.950
"Your tiny face, your tiny hand.

08:54.980 --> 08:58.740
Never have I felt a love so grand.

09:00.660 --> 09:02.690
Gay.

09:08.380 --> 09:11.360
What do you know about
poetry, you monkey?

09:17.140 --> 09:18.390
Oh, hey, Herb.

09:18.410 --> 09:21.110
Just thought I'd stop by and see if you
needed any help with the baby's room.

09:21.130 --> 09:22.320
Thanks, I'm painting today.

09:22.330 --> 09:26.760
Oh, great. Just call me Vincent
Van "Gogh-ing" to help you.

09:28.510 --> 09:31.030
Funnier in my head. Let's go.

09:31.610 --> 09:33.880
Oh, Judith, look who stopped by
to help paint the baby's room.

09:33.890 --> 09:35.110
Surprise.

09:35.150 --> 09:36.570
Herb doesn't need any help, Alan.

09:36.590 --> 09:39.100
- Yes, I do.
- Yes, he does.

09:39.110 --> 09:42.130
Come on, I'm just finishing up the base coat,
but I'm gonna start on the unicorn stencils.

09:42.150 --> 09:46.500
Unicorns? Oh, Herb, that's
just a pony with a strap-on1

09:50.800 --> 09:52.430
I know, tell me about it.

09:52.450 --> 09:56.080
It's like nine kinds of
"suck" in an eight-suck bag.

09:56.550 --> 09:58.520
- Hey, Jake?
- Gotta go.

09:58.530 --> 10:00.150
I didn't mean to interrupt your call.

10:00.170 --> 10:03.420
Yeah, well, you should've thought
of that before you barged in.

10:05.060 --> 10:06.970
Yeah.

10:06.980 --> 10:11.540
The reason I barged in was to apologize
for threatening to kick your ass.

10:11.570 --> 10:13.050
I wouldn't really do that.

10:13.060 --> 10:15.800
You couldn't really do that.

10:17.850 --> 10:21.510
Anyway, I was thinking about
ordering a pizza. You interested?

10:21.520 --> 10:23.240
No, thanks.

10:23.260 --> 10:26.340
Maybe you didn't hear me. Pizza.

10:26.830 --> 10:30.740
Dough, sauce, cheese, grease,
meat. I've seen you lick the box.

10:30.750 --> 10:32.710
I'm not hungry.

10:32.740 --> 10:36.140
- Okay, what the hell's wrong with you?
- Nothing.

10:36.150 --> 10:38.770
Fine. Be that way.

10:41.470 --> 10:43.610
I know what's going on here.

10:43.640 --> 10:45.900
You're bent out of shape 'cause
your mom's having another baby.

10:45.930 --> 10:48.880
- No, I'm not.
- It's okay. Nothing to be ashamed of.

10:48.890 --> 10:51.360
In fact, I know exactly how you feel.

10:51.380 --> 10:54.830
My mom's second child ruined my life.

10:54.840 --> 10:57.220
That's my dad.

10:58.410 --> 11:01.230
Listen, it wasn't all bad.

11:01.250 --> 11:03.770
When babies grow up a little,
you can have fun with 'em.

11:03.790 --> 11:08.060
You know, pee in their
canteen, teach 'em to stutter.

11:08.070 --> 11:11.900
Of course, the down side is they're so
damaged later on they move into your guest room

11:11.910 --> 11:14.750
with their kid and never leave.

11:14.760 --> 11:17.370
Not that I don't love having you here.

11:17.390 --> 11:19.970
You're a delight.

11:20.520 --> 11:22.410
I'm fine with the baby.

11:22.420 --> 11:25.640
- Really?
- Yeah. I'm actually kinda looking forward to it.

11:25.650 --> 11:27.830
Well, that's a novel approach.

11:27.840 --> 11:31.870
So if it's not the baby, why have
you been such a dillweed lately?

11:31.890 --> 11:33.250
None of your business.

11:33.270 --> 11:34.350
So it's a girl.

11:34.370 --> 11:35.830
Just get out of my room.

11:35.840 --> 11:39.670
- Make me.
- God, you're such a child.

11:42.060 --> 11:45.180
Oh, yeah, it's a girl.

11:45.480 --> 11:48.280
- Hmm, Jolene.
- Yeah.

11:48.290 --> 11:50.970
Jolene Melnick.

11:50.980 --> 11:52.250
Nope, I don't think so.

11:52.260 --> 11:54.910
Why not? You could call her Jo or Josie.

11:54.920 --> 11:57.840
Kinda wanted to name her
after my Grandma Mildred.

11:58.030 --> 12:01.930
- Mildred Melnick?
- Yeah. We could call her Mil, or Millie.

12:01.940 --> 12:03.060
I'm sorry, Herb.

12:03.070 --> 12:06.980
But with a name like Mildred you might
as well call her Staff Sergeant Melnick.

12:07.700 --> 12:09.480
Herb, can you get the cookies for me?

12:09.500 --> 12:12.360
Oh, sure. We, uh, keep 'em on
the top shelf of the pantry.

12:12.370 --> 12:14.610
- You know... Jake.
- Yeah.

12:14.620 --> 12:17.580
Charlie keeps his fudge
nuggets in the trunk of his car.

12:17.590 --> 12:20.270
Thank you, dear.

12:20.970 --> 12:23.250
What are you doing here?

12:23.600 --> 12:25.590
I'm helping my friend, helping you.

12:25.610 --> 12:29.860
If not for me, our little girl would
be surrounded by metaphorical pony peni.

12:29.870 --> 12:30.930
Our little girl?

12:30.960 --> 12:33.480
Alan, I don't know what you
imagine happened between you and me,

12:33.510 --> 12:35.050
but if you say anything to Herb,

12:35.070 --> 12:39.250
I swear to God I'll put a gun in your mouth
and paint these walls with your brains.

12:39.260 --> 12:42.310
I think we settled on mermaids.

12:42.320 --> 12:43.500
Cookie for my cookie?

12:43.510 --> 12:45.870
Oh, yum. Thank you.

12:49.090 --> 12:51.360
Pregnancy's a wild ride, huh?

12:51.380 --> 12:55.230
One minute she's loving and affectionate,
the next minute she's, well...

12:55.240 --> 12:57.880
Cruel, vengeful, castrating?

12:57.900 --> 12:59.680
I was going to say moody.

12:59.700 --> 13:01.820
Wait for it.

13:03.390 --> 13:05.790
Of course I want to go to the party.

13:05.800 --> 13:08.700
'Cause my stupid uncle won't let me.

13:11.090 --> 13:14.040
I don't know, 'cause
he's old and clueless.

13:14.050 --> 13:15.310
No, I can't sneak out.

13:15.320 --> 13:17.080
'Cause I gotta be here to
change his adult diapers.

13:17.090 --> 13:20.380
Otherwise he just sits in his own filth.

13:20.740 --> 13:23.860
I know, it's really gross.

13:23.870 --> 13:26.660
- Hi there.
- Gotta go.

13:28.330 --> 13:30.970
You're not supposed to listen
to my private conversations.

13:30.990 --> 13:34.150
You're not supposed to
tell people I crap my pants.

13:34.160 --> 13:36.750
Okay, whatever.

13:40.560 --> 13:44.090
So what's the deal with this party that
I'm supposedly not letting you go to,

13:44.100 --> 13:47.120
like I actually give a rat's
ass about your social life?

13:47.140 --> 13:48.600
Just leave me alone.

13:48.620 --> 13:50.260
You know that's not going to happen.

13:50.280 --> 13:51.630
Come on. You can trust me.

13:51.640 --> 13:53.900
You told me never trust
a guy who says "trust me."

13:53.910 --> 13:56.000
Did you trust me when I told you that?

13:56.840 --> 13:58.530
I'm confused.

13:58.560 --> 14:01.730
Of course you are. Now tell me why
you don't want to go to this party.

14:01.740 --> 14:03.480
I can't tell you. It's embarrassing.

14:03.490 --> 14:05.640
Okay, okay.

14:06.840 --> 14:09.850
How about I tell you something
embarrassing about myself first?

14:09.880 --> 14:11.410
Like what?

14:11.420 --> 14:13.560
Well, let's see.

14:13.570 --> 14:18.950
All right, about 15 years
ago, I was in Bangkok.

14:20.760 --> 14:22.810
- What?
- Bangkok.

14:25.360 --> 14:27.570
It's a real place, you nimrod.

14:27.590 --> 14:30.150
Still funny though.

14:30.160 --> 14:34.330
Anyway, I was in this bar and
I met this beautiful woman,

14:34.360 --> 14:38.700
and I was a little drunk and I
didn't notice the Adam's apple.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.220
But later that night...

14:44.660 --> 14:47.930
Well, believe me, I
was really embarrassed.

14:47.950 --> 14:50.910
Girls don't have Adam's apples.

14:51.970 --> 14:55.310
Oh, dude, you are such a 'mo.

14:56.630 --> 14:58.740
No, no, no, no, we just kissed.

14:58.770 --> 15:01.400
Oh, that's even worse1

15:02.440 --> 15:04.590
All right. I shared. Now you share.

15:04.600 --> 15:07.410
You didn't have to share that.

15:07.890 --> 15:11.300
A fart in the lunch line
would've made your point.

15:11.600 --> 15:14.770
I get it. I'm sorry. Now talk.

15:15.840 --> 15:17.510
Okay.

15:17.520 --> 15:21.740
Well, there's this girl I kinda like
and she's gonna be at the party tonight.

15:22.120 --> 15:26.180
And she... said she
wants to hook up with me.

15:26.190 --> 15:27.560
And you're nervous.

15:27.580 --> 15:31.170
Well, she's gone out with a ninth
grader and I think she's done stuff.

15:31.190 --> 15:33.070
Okay, I get it.

15:33.110 --> 15:36.210
You've got yourself an experienced
older woman who knows more than you.

15:36.240 --> 15:37.700
Everybody knows more than me.

15:37.720 --> 15:39.940
You should hear some of the
things my friends have done.

15:39.950 --> 15:42.210
Oh, please. How old are your friends?

15:42.220 --> 15:44.590
Same age as me.

15:46.630 --> 15:49.090
- How old are you?
- Fourteen.

15:49.100 --> 15:52.080
Mmm, horrible age.

15:52.990 --> 15:57.740
All right, first of all, whenever 14-year-old
boys talk about sex, they're lying.

15:57.760 --> 16:02.270
But for a guy like you, the
truth can be a powerful tool.

16:04.740 --> 16:07.620
- What?
- Powerful tool.

16:08.880 --> 16:10.290
Stay with me, Jake.

16:10.310 --> 16:12.960
How about a powerful tool in Bangkok?

16:13.900 --> 16:18.240
Jake, what I'm trying to tell you here
is that the truth can work for you.

16:18.280 --> 16:20.150
What truth? That I don't
know what I'm doing?

16:20.160 --> 16:24.790
Yep, play to your strengths,
which in your case is ignorance.

16:25.350 --> 16:28.110
Here, I'll show you.

16:29.870 --> 16:34.830
You gently cup her face in your hands,
look her in the eye and tell her,

16:35.250 --> 16:39.380
"I'm new at this and I'm trusting
you to be patient with me."

16:39.390 --> 16:41.480
You're kidding.

16:41.490 --> 16:44.980
Nope. Girls eat that crap up.

16:44.990 --> 16:49.480
And I'll tell you something else-- that line
will work for you all the way through college.

16:49.490 --> 16:52.870
Or in your case, your
second hitch in the Navy.

16:54.080 --> 16:57.610
Now go get dressed and
I'll take you to that party.

16:57.620 --> 16:59.050
Thanks, Uncle Charlie.

16:59.070 --> 17:00.540
No problem, buddy.

17:00.550 --> 17:03.330
Still didn't need to
hear that Bangkok story.

17:03.340 --> 17:04.530
I'm sorry.

17:04.560 --> 17:07.250
It's going to give me nightmares.

17:08.130 --> 17:10.819
Welcome to the club.

17:13.770 --> 17:16.200
All right, we're agreed
on a Montessori preschool.

17:16.210 --> 17:17.750
But what about child care?

17:17.760 --> 17:21.270
Oh, well, uh, Judith's mother has already
told us we can count on her for baby-sitting.

17:23.390 --> 17:24.760
What?

17:24.770 --> 17:26.569
Oh, nothing, nothing.
Lenore's a lovely woman.

17:26.579 --> 17:28.369
I'm, I'm sure the baby will be fine.

17:28.380 --> 17:30.320
Oh, okay, good.

17:30.330 --> 17:34.530
Yeah. She's probably got
a lid on those dons by now.

17:34.840 --> 17:36.300
What demons?

17:36.320 --> 17:38.250
Oh, ah, well, it's no biggie.

17:38.270 --> 17:42.540
Um, she just, uh, hit a little rough
patch with the prescription pills...

17:42.880 --> 17:46.400
the intervention, the, the rehab.

17:46.740 --> 17:47.980
There was an intervention?

17:48.010 --> 17:51.350
And rehab. Um, three times.

17:51.860 --> 17:53.180
Three times?

17:53.200 --> 17:55.170
Well, so far.

17:55.180 --> 17:58.100
Oh, dear God, what the hell happened?

17:59.090 --> 18:02.120
Golly, I-I didn't want
to be the one to tell you.

18:02.130 --> 18:04.910
Alan, please.

18:04.930 --> 18:09.230
All right, um, Lenore was
baby-sitting one night,

18:09.250 --> 18:11.340
and when Judith and I came home,

18:11.370 --> 18:16.000
we found her face down in a bowl of H agen-Dazs
with a couple of Percocets in her hair.

18:16.270 --> 18:17.440
You're kidding.

18:17.460 --> 18:19.320
Well, that's not the scary part.

18:19.340 --> 18:22.400
Um, we heard some shrieking and, uh,

18:22.420 --> 18:27.420
found baby Jake with his head stuck in a
doggie door trying to fend off a raccoon.

18:27.800 --> 18:29.280
A raccoon?

18:29.290 --> 18:32.330
Yeah. Yeah.We-we got him all
the shots just to be safe,

18:32.340 --> 18:35.870
but he was never the same after that.

18:36.530 --> 18:38.560
Judith never told me about this.

18:38.590 --> 18:41.390
Well, it's her mother,
Herb. What's she gonna say?

18:41.400 --> 18:46.320
But tell you what, sneak up on Jake one night
wearing a Davy Crockett hat and see what happens.

18:47.090 --> 18:53.330
Anyway, if you ever need a-a sitter for
little Jolene, you, uh, you call Uncle Alan.

18:53.740 --> 18:54.900
How's it going in here?

18:54.910 --> 18:56.610
Oh, honey, good news.

18:56.620 --> 18:59.980
Alan's offered to baby-sit so we
don't have to risk calling your mother.

19:01.200 --> 19:03.720
Get out1

19:04.410 --> 19:05.860
A raccoon?

19:05.870 --> 19:07.250
And you believed him?

19:07.260 --> 19:09.570
Are you insane?

19:16.100 --> 19:18.200
How do I look?

19:18.720 --> 19:21.120
- She already likes you, right?
- Yeah.

19:21.670 --> 19:23.600
Then you look great.

19:26.220 --> 19:28.310
Let's go.

19:30.850 --> 19:32.980
Hello?

19:37.210 --> 19:39.830
I'm still not real sure about this.

19:39.850 --> 19:42.840
What's the big deal? I
told you how to handle it.

19:42.850 --> 19:45.340
I know. I just...

19:45.720 --> 19:48.220
I just don't want to go.

19:49.240 --> 19:51.990
All right... All right.

19:52.450 --> 19:53.690
No hurry.

19:53.710 --> 19:56.480
It's not like they're
going to stop makin' girls.

20:02.930 --> 20:05.070
how about we order that
pizza and watch a movie?

20:05.080 --> 20:08.630
Cool. I should probably change
back into my eating shirt.

20:09.390 --> 20:12.250
Don't worry. You can't ruin this shirt.

20:14.030 --> 20:15.700
What the hell is that cologne?

20:15.710 --> 20:18.240
Air freshener from the toilet.

20:20.380 --> 20:23.290
I figured I was spraying it anyway.

20:25.200 --> 20:28.610
<i>14 years later</i>

20:35.700 --> 20:38.920
Oh, hey, Judith. What's up?

20:38.930 --> 20:41.300
Actually, quite a bit.

20:41.310 --> 20:42.370
Is something wrong?

20:42.390 --> 20:47.830
No, uh, it's just, um, I think
it's time you knew the truth.

20:47.840 --> 20:49.420
What truth?

20:49.440 --> 20:52.460
Marlene Melnick is your daughter.
