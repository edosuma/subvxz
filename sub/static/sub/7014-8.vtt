WEBVTT

00:04.677 --> 00:07.106
Gooood morning.
- Try good 13:30.

00:08.697 --> 00:12.495
I'm just so worn out from carrying 
around all this tip money. Here you go, mom.

00:12.776 --> 00:15.743
Why don't you, kick up the thermostat 
couple deegres on me.

00:17.387 --> 00:22.692
Well,thank you honey. And you have been
such a big help working yourself nearly
to death. I made you

00:22.907 --> 00:26.916
your special sandwich.
- Oooh, "the Eric McSweady".

00:29.326 --> 00:31.856
It's a regular sandwich.
Hold the masculinity.

00:34.944 --> 00:38.419
It's almost time for Red's doctors appointment.
I have to iron his underware.

00:40.580 --> 00:45.016
No crust, check, extra jelly, check.
My mommy loves me. Check.

00:48.152 --> 00:55.117
Eric, wow you look beat. - Yeah, I was working
until like 1:00 last night. - Oh, my poor baby.

00:56.342 --> 00:57.776
I know something that will cheer you up.

00:58.433 --> 01:02.797
Today, I got my first bridal magazine.

01:05.379 --> 01:07.616
We can spend the whole afternoon 
talking about wedding stuff.

01:09.526 --> 01:12.890
Like, the groomsmen can wear kilts.

01:14.542 --> 01:18.762
Donna, you know how much I'd love to spend
4-5 hours talking about the wedding,

01:19.107 --> 01:26.037
or clothes, or clothes for the wedding,
but, God I'm so beat from last night.

01:27.291 --> 01:32.082
Okay. Why don't you go back to bad,and I'll 
crawl up with you after class, but this time

01:32.324 --> 01:36.442
sweep the bed for GI Joes, cause that last 
thing that happened that was unpleasant.

01:38.000 --> 01:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:45.942 --> 01:48.754
Life is a cabaret, my friend!

01:50.189 --> 01:53.917
You didn't work untill 1:00. We got 
off at 22:00 and played poker.

01:54.155 --> 01:57.361
Hyde, let's not wear ourselves 
down with the truth here.

01:58.752 --> 02:02.840
When I started working full time, I thought 
that my life was gonna be a total grind,

02:03.063 --> 02:06.037
but my mom, Donna, 
they can't do enaugh for me.

02:06.298 --> 02:09.823
Look at this. Heart shaped sandwiches.
Donna's giving me sexy naps.

02:10.640 --> 02:14.002
As God is my witness I will never go
hungry or horny again.

02:15.621 --> 02:19.348
Will you please wear the ironed underware.
I have a reputation to protect.

02:20.998 --> 02:25.444
Eric, you're driving me to my doctors appointment.
Please, put on pants.

02:27.472 --> 02:32.370
Eric is a little tired from working so late,
so I found someone else to drive you.

02:33.367 --> 02:35.389
Jump in Smokey,
Bandit's on the move.

03:17.124 --> 03:23.025
Okay Brooke. Here's the thing. We should date. 
- Michael, I'm pregnant with your child.

03:25.135 --> 03:28.684
Pretty much the best and  worst things 
about dating have allready happened to us.

03:29.989 --> 03:32.181
Okay, but we missed out on all the in between.

03:32.534 --> 03:37.012
Like. Okay, we need to spice up our illegitimate pregnancy with a little romance.

03:38.422 --> 03:43.472
I mean, look how much we have in common.
You are having my baby,

03:43.763 --> 03:46.757
and I am the father of your baby.

03:49.093 --> 03:52.277
Okay look, don't pretend you wanna go out 
with me just because you feel guilty.

03:52.591 --> 03:55.008
Brooke, I wanna go out with 
you cause you're hot.

03:57.348 --> 04:01.182
Okay fine, but I'm not hot.
I've gain six pounds.

04:01.407 --> 04:05.141
That's okay, cause it's mostly in your boobs.

04:05.603 --> 04:10.887
See, nature does this to keep us 
guys around while you gals chunk out.

04:18.255 --> 04:21.475
Okay, let's get couple of things straight.
I don't wanna be here,

04:21.692 --> 04:25.214
you don't wanna be here.
- I wan't to be here.

04:27.009 --> 04:31.378
Fine. I don't wanna be here,
and I don't care what you want.

04:32.050 --> 04:35.044
Okay then. Are you buckled up?
- Yes.

04:37.293 --> 04:40.978
Hmm, because the little blinking man 
on the dashboard says you aren't.

04:43.710 --> 04:49.456
Buckle up. - No. - Yes.
- No. Look, start this car

04:49.657 --> 04:53.979
or I'm gonna pack you in the crate, take you down to the port and trade you for a year supply of bananas.

05:02.963 --> 05:05.380
Hey. - Hey.
- You awake?

05:06.164 --> 05:11.846
Well, if I were asleep there'd be six 
of you all making out with yourselves.

05:15.666 --> 05:18.391
Can't belive how late you must stay at the restaurant. 
- Well, you know

05:18.646 --> 05:21.852
that grated cheese you like so much?
Gets grated the night before.

05:22.084 --> 05:27.338
Yeah, little thing we like to call "prep", so. 
- I love it when you use restourant talk.

05:29.911 --> 05:35.337
Donna, I have to warn you, I'm exhausted.
So, you're gonna have to do all the work.

05:38.432 --> 05:40.555
Why should today be any different?

05:51.996 --> 05:55.941
I need to know what to do on a first date with a women who is carrying my child?

05:58.126 --> 06:00.150
Hold her while she weeps.

06:02.026 --> 06:05.854
Hey wait, what if you guys came to dinner with me and Brooke? It would make easier to find stuff

06:06.108 --> 06:09.896
to talk about. - No, no man, there is no way 
I'm going on a date with your ex girlfriend

06:10.133 --> 06:12.036
who is now my girlfiend,
and your new girlfriend

06:12.284 --> 06:14.458
who doesn't wanna be your girlfriend,
but is pregnant with your child.

06:16.717 --> 06:19.453
It's like hillbilly territory.

06:22.732 --> 06:24.195
I'll pay.

06:25.054 --> 06:26.106
I'm in.

06:27.778 --> 06:31.031
Well then i have to go find something to wear. I mean i'm happy that Brooke's gonna have 

06:31.252 --> 06:34.920
a father for her baby and all, but I still have to look prettier than her.

06:37.560 --> 06:44.237
Well I was woken from my afternooon nap by my girlfriend for some afternoon delight,

06:45.851 --> 06:48.615
afterwhich i took another afternoon nap.

06:50.794 --> 06:55.992
You know what i have right in the palm of my hand?
- No one wants to know that. Just wash up.

07:00.152 --> 07:02.219
The secret of life.

07:05.393 --> 07:09.048
You know what? I'm taking this one step 
further, fellas. I'm gonna get fat.

07:14.015 --> 07:17.506
Yeah, i'll never be strong, 
but i think i can be fat.

07:18.730 --> 07:20.305
That's a pretty thought.

07:29.828 --> 07:34.071
C'mon, Fez, don't be scared.
Go say "hi".

07:36.019 --> 07:38.030
No, he's too fat.

07:39.204 --> 07:41.234
I don't know where his face is.

07:42.676 --> 07:46.708
He can't eat you. He can't even move.
Watch!

07:50.452 --> 07:52.128
That tickles.

07:53.665 --> 07:55.392
Aaah, something's poking me.

07:58.288 --> 08:02.930
GI Joe.
There you are.

08:03.122 --> 08:04.996
What else is in there?

08:06.795 --> 08:08.027
Kelso!

08:09.687 --> 08:13.842
I thought you moved away!
- I've been living on crumbs!

08:22.128 --> 08:24.799
Alright, okay. Laugh all you want but all I 
see is a guy who doesn't have to go out of bed 

08:25.066 --> 08:29.450
to go to the bathroom... And that's beautiful.

08:32.836 --> 08:35.289
Hey look there's the "Oaks Lodge".
Pull over.

08:36.144 --> 08:38.616
But i thought we would celebrate your good checkup.

08:38.927 --> 08:42.696
There's this pie down at the coffee shop 
I've been flirting with for days.

08:43.662 --> 08:47.347
How about this for a celebration, I'm 
going in there with my budies and you

08:47.584 --> 08:50.271
wait in the car.
- But that does not sound like fun.

08:51.874 --> 08:53.606
Well, that's how we celebrate in America.

09:05.108 --> 09:07.119
Okay, let's head for home.

09:11.399 --> 09:14.126
So now you're not gonna talk?
- Why should I talk?

09:15.239 --> 09:18.267
My feelings are obviously of no consequence to you.

09:19.508 --> 09:23.580
Alright, maybe I stayed a little 
longer then I expected.

09:24.437 --> 09:27.813
Hey look, how about we stop for some pie? 
- No.

09:29.519 --> 09:33.012
Oh c'mon, let me get you a pie.
- I am not in the mood.

09:33.943 --> 09:36.952
Oh just let me buy you a...
- There will be no pie!

09:45.647 --> 09:50.861
Wow, good pot.There's gotta 
be like 4 or 5 bucks in there.

09:52.629 --> 09:55.952
Yeah you guys are going down.
I gotta a full house.

09:58.541 --> 10:02.788
I mean... What do I got?

10:04.231 --> 10:06.767
Why don't you bet a lot and see.

10:07.822 --> 10:12.160
Kelso, I know you think you got a full house,
but you're only holding two cards.

10:13.923 --> 10:15.438
So I'll raise.

10:17.456 --> 10:21.550
This is great. It's 
1:00 and I'm not alone.

10:22.787 --> 10:24.556
I'm not alone. This is great.

10:26.654 --> 10:30.285
Guys I don't wanna brag but my 
belt is getting pretty tight.

10:31.092 --> 10:34.360
I think operation "Fat Eric" 
is well under way.

10:37.775 --> 10:39.103
What the hell are you doing?

10:40.460 --> 10:42.236
You told me you were working.

10:44.126 --> 10:47.485
I brought you brownies because you told
me you were working your ass off.

10:47.799 --> 10:51.730
And now it turns out you were spending all the time, we could have spent together, with the guys.

10:52.155 --> 10:54.321
And, I gave you daytime sex.

10:59.789 --> 11:02.688
Alright.
Who brought brownies?

11:10.615 --> 11:14.786
Is Eric upstairs? - Just look for the lump under the cover sucking his thumb.

11:16.204 --> 11:21.195
Hey, you gonna yell? - No, I'm past yelling. 
- What's past yelling?

11:22.093 --> 11:24.328
It's the dark side of the moon, my friend.

11:25.874 --> 11:31.070
The place so ugly if it was a women 
even you wouldn't have sex with her.

11:32.061 --> 11:33.502
Ahh, that's bad.

11:41.842 --> 11:44.412
How can you sleep untill noon
after what happened last night?

11:45.184 --> 11:47.475
I'm exhausted from loving you so much.

11:49.087 --> 11:54.125
You're completely regressing. You lie around all day
and you act if you'd be happy

11:54.363 --> 11:57.290
to stay in your mothers house forever. 
- Look Donna, let me make it up to you.

11:57.575 --> 12:00.631
There's some tip money on the dresser.
Why don't you go buy yourself something pretty?

12:08.490 --> 12:10.063
Don' worry, we can still hear!

12:13.647 --> 12:18.224
Eric, what is happening to you?
- Look Donna, I'm sorry but I'm not regressing.

12:18.900 --> 12:21.911
You gotta understand I'm the
man of this house now.

12:22.371 --> 12:27.520
Okay, who is ready for a Spidey
and a sandwich? - Me!

12:30.473 --> 12:36.119
Mrs. Forman, your son is a big lazy chump because
you keep babying him. - I don't baby him.

12:37.408 --> 12:39.539
Is there a crust on that sandwich?

12:40.213 --> 12:45.699
Well of course not. Crusts are 
icky they make Eric sicky.

12:47.126 --> 12:49.718
Oh my God, I'm ruining him.

12:50.862 --> 12:54.834
Eric, things are gonna change 
around here, drastically. 
Tomarrow you are getting 

12:55.161 --> 13:00.711
a sandwich whith crust on.
And no more crazy straws.

13:00.978 --> 13:04.364
You will be drinking your chocolate 
milk from a standard straw.

13:06.802 --> 13:09.334
Now, who's hungry?
- I call sandwich. - I call Spidey.

13:09.629 --> 13:12.257
I call sandwiches you haven't made yet.

13:14.562 --> 13:20.027
Okay, Donna I get it, I'm sorry.
- No, that's not gonna cut it.

13:20.347 --> 13:24.850
I've been wearing this engagement ring
so long it's white under there,

13:25.092 --> 13:28.766
and a little wrinkly. You haven't 
brought up the wedding in weeks.

13:29.850 --> 13:32.297
I stayed home from college to be
with you. And if i knew

13:32.526 --> 13:36.115
you were gonna act like this, I would 
have gone. - You right. - I know.

13:38.305 --> 13:40.885
Donna, I know that I'm
lucky to be with you.

13:41.111 --> 13:43.759
Hell, when we go out together,
people think I'm your little brother.

13:45.425 --> 13:47.981
That's true. They say I shouldn't
have you out so late.

13:49.591 --> 13:51.262
You are right. No, you are absolutely right.

13:53.421 --> 13:58.439
I'm really, really sorry. Okay?
So, are you still mad at me?

14:00.903 --> 14:04.185
Well, it's kind of hard when
you keep agreeing with me.

14:04.454 --> 14:07.850
I agree. - Stop it.
- You're beautiful. - I will kick your ass.

14:21.782 --> 14:28.469
So, maybe a good way to break the ice would be for everyone to tell a few things about themselves.
I'll go first

14:29.888 --> 14:35.795
I like makeup and diets, 
and Steven here likes black things

14:36.048 --> 14:38.626
and throwing stuff at glass.

14:44.262 --> 14:47.906
Okay. Well, I was valedictorian at my class,
I ran marathons 

14:48.171 --> 14:50.600
and I tutor kids in Latin.

14:54.958 --> 15:00.100
Well, I egged the valedictorian of my class
and a marathon runner.

15:00.936 --> 15:02.933
Oh, and some kids that took Latin.

15:05.683 --> 15:06.950
This is fun.

15:08.869 --> 15:13.070
So, how do you guys all know eachother?
- Well, Michael and I dated for like 3 years.

15:13.593 --> 15:15.605
Then I stole her from him.
- Wait what?

15:16.717 --> 15:20.231
You never could have stolen from 
me if I hadn't cheated on her first.

15:21.427 --> 15:25.028
Okay, wait a minute... - That sounds a lot worse than what it is. I only cheated on her

15:25.279 --> 15:27.075
with Erics sister.

15:28.258 --> 15:32.411
Well, and then the rest of the 
girls when we were on a break 

15:32.602 --> 15:35.496
cause I annoyed her, but none of 
those girls were anybodies sister.

15:36.684 --> 15:39.296
Except for the two that were sisters.

15:40.838 --> 15:43.898
He brought up the sisters.
Awsome.

15:47.288 --> 15:49.324
Okay. This was a mistake. I think I'm gonna go.
- No, Brooke wait.

15:53.309 --> 15:56.432
I've been with a lot of chicks, a lot...

15:58.474 --> 16:02.886
a lot... a lot.

16:04.494 --> 16:08.742
Okay, that's not helping.
- Brooke, just let me start over, okay?

16:10.521 --> 16:15.658
We might not be a perfect match, okay,
 but I really, really like you

16:16.653 --> 16:22.825
and I think us having this baby 
together is like... faith.

16:23.325 --> 16:28.092
Michael, faith is when two people
meet on a train or in Paris,

16:28.325 --> 16:30.926
not in a bathroom at a 
Molly Hatchet concert.

16:33.875 --> 16:36.930
Faith. Man, never use a word in a fight

16:37.159 --> 16:39.738
if you don't really really knows what it means.

16:52.902 --> 16:54.989
Still not speaking to me?

16:58.216 --> 17:00.001
Fine, I'll speak.

17:00.450 --> 17:05.044
I spent all day running your bold,
grumpy ass around town.

17:05.320 --> 17:10.527
And do I get a thanks? No.
Because you're unpleasant.

17:16.066 --> 17:20.640
You wanna know why I'm unpleasant?
I just had a heart attack,

17:20.896 --> 17:24.957
and now I have to be driven around like a
useless dope

17:25.221 --> 17:30.195
by the idiot that marry my daughter and gave
me the heart attack in the first place.

17:31.967 --> 17:37.937
But I am also unpleasant because I just
spent the entire day cooped up in the car,

17:38.280 --> 17:43.624
breathing that mustard gas that you call cologne.

17:44.316 --> 17:50.455
But mostly I'm unpleasant because 
that's how it works in this family.

17:55.528 --> 17:57.686
I'm family?

18:00.795 --> 18:01.872
Oh crap.

18:07.170 --> 18:10.834
Guys, everything is totally cool. I've 
promised to stop acting like such an ass,

18:11.103 --> 18:15.798
and give Donna only presents, not cash.

18:16.801 --> 18:23.478
Why is that? - Because presents are 
for girlfriends and cash is for hookers.

18:24.357 --> 18:29.432
Although... 
- You're so good I should pay you.
- Thank you.

18:31.079 --> 18:34.485
You should've seen it coming Forman.
Cause when you're deeply, 

18:34.713 --> 18:37.540
trully happy, it's a sure sign you're
doing everything wrong.

18:38.550 --> 18:43.354
It's true. Once Steven's unhappy, 
I know our relationship is in good shape.

18:44.706 --> 18:47.467
Well, then we've been tip top
since the minute i've meet you.

18:50.162 --> 18:54.200
Yeah, I couldn't be unhappier about 
me and Brooke, so I know I'm doing

18:54.517 --> 18:57.705
the right thing. Cause the misery is how God
lets you know you're on track.

18:59.467 --> 19:04.423
And how. Red and I are miserable together,
and that crazy bastard is nuts about me.

19:06.039 --> 19:10.833
Donna,what are you doing the day after your birthday?
- Nursing a hangover.

19:12.462 --> 19:17.297
You might wanna stick to light beer. Cause I was thinking maybe we could get married that day.

19:18.291 --> 19:23.048
Oh my God, are you setting a date?
You can't set a date in a circle.

19:23.384 --> 19:26.621
I can and I did.
- I love you.

19:30.939 --> 19:34.446
There's no groping in the circle!
We made that rule for Fez,

19:34.691 --> 19:36.427
but i goes for everyone!

19:37.318 --> 19:41.660
Oh, c'mon Eric take charge,
grab her like you mean it.
I'll do it.

19:45.915 --> 19:46.901
Brooke?

19:47.365 --> 19:53.267
Holly crap! That's the girl you got pregnant?
She's hot!

19:56.913 --> 19:59.740
Do you think we could talk alone for a minute?

20:00.061 --> 20:05.858
Sure, I'll go. But just know if it doesn't work out with him, I've got dental

20:06.103 --> 20:11.106
for all dependents.
- You're funny. - I love you.

20:13.425 --> 20:16.145
Goodbye.
I've got a things to do.

20:21.215 --> 20:25.243
Look. I don't know why what happened happened.
I mean it could've been faith,

20:25.744 --> 20:30.735
it could've been the Colt 45s,
but I do know you're beeing very sweet,

20:31.427 --> 20:35.648
and I could probably use a hand, cause to 
tell you do truth I'm kind of scared.

20:37.019 --> 20:40.145
That's perfect cause I'm terrified.

20:40.418 --> 20:44.692
I know, I mean it's crazy.
- We're having a baby! - I know!

20:45.422 --> 20:48.589
And we have no clue!
- None at all!

20:50.972 --> 20:55.694
So, can I call you tomarrow? - Yes.

20:59.668 --> 21:04.534
Before you go I just wanted to say, I don't love you.

21:04.982 --> 21:10.107
I just kind of get nervous in front of women.
I blurr.

21:16.349 --> 21:18.394
What is wrong with me?

21:23.542 --> 21:26.452
Hi Roy.
- Hello Brooke.

21:27.927 --> 21:31.992
Hi Roy.
- Hello Brooke.

21:33.811 --> 21:37.760
HI, Roy.
- Hello, Brooke.

21:40.128 --> 21:41.179
I got this.

21:41.913 --> 21:44.045
Hi Roy.
- I love you.

21:45.760 --> 21:50.281
Excuse me. - Roy, that's the freezer.
