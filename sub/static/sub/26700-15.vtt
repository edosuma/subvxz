WEBVTT

00:00.876 --> 00:03.962
Previously on Legacies...
Penelope is leaving the school.

00:03.962 --> 00:05.380
Oh, yeah. I knew that.

00:05.380 --> 00:07.758
You never consider anybody's
feelings but your own.

00:07.758 --> 00:09.218
PENELOPE:
It's a log of everything

00:09.218 --> 00:10.677
written down
at the Salvatore School,

00:10.677 --> 00:13.305
and I want you to read
what your dad wrote

00:13.305 --> 00:14.848
about something called
the Merge.

00:14.848 --> 00:15.807
What's Malivore?

00:15.807 --> 00:17.559
HOPE:
It's a hell dimension

00:17.559 --> 00:19.019
that consumes creatures
and wipes their existence

00:19.019 --> 00:20.520
from the collective conscience.

00:20.520 --> 00:22.689
I don't even know how long
I was in Malivore.

00:22.689 --> 00:24.733
And then, one day,
I found myself back here.

00:24.733 --> 00:25.776
I was pregnant.

00:25.776 --> 00:27.194
ALARIC:
So Landon is the, uh,

00:27.194 --> 00:29.529
supernatural
immaculate conception?

00:29.529 --> 00:31.740
You are keeping a
secret about my mom?

00:31.740 --> 00:34.117
I can't be here right now.
Landon. Landon!

00:34.117 --> 00:36.036
Your asset failed
her retrieval mission.

00:36.036 --> 00:38.205
I cleaned up her mess.

00:43.543 --> 00:46.046
Usual debrief before
you throw him into the pit.

00:46.046 --> 00:47.881
Find out where he's from.
Family.

00:47.881 --> 00:50.676
Any other phoenixes
he's willing to give up.

00:50.676 --> 00:52.803
Then ask him about the knife.

00:52.803 --> 00:53.929
As in the knife?

00:53.929 --> 00:55.097
When I was
at the school,

00:55.097 --> 00:56.765
I heard he tried to steal it.

00:56.765 --> 00:58.433
And I'd like to know
why he wanted

00:58.433 --> 00:59.893
one of the locks to the pit.

00:59.893 --> 01:01.770
Shouldn't be
too difficult.

01:01.770 --> 01:04.731
He recorded the voice mail
with minimal resistance.

01:07.985 --> 01:09.695
(scanner beeps)

01:16.743 --> 01:18.370
(beeping)

01:18.370 --> 01:20.247
(whirring, clicking)

01:23.625 --> 01:24.960
(grunts)

01:24.960 --> 01:27.421
(panting)

01:32.092 --> 01:33.760
No one's watching us now.

01:34.761 --> 01:36.179
Look,

01:36.179 --> 01:37.931
I already told the other guys
I don't know anything.

01:41.852 --> 01:43.437
You can kill me,
but I'm part phoenix,

01:43.437 --> 01:45.188
so I'm just gonna come back
to life

01:45.188 --> 01:46.898
in a burst of flames, and
there's gonna be a lot of ash

01:46.898 --> 01:48.567
to clean up. And
after I come back,

01:48.567 --> 01:50.485
I'm not gonna
know anything.

01:50.485 --> 01:52.988
I'm not here to interrogate you,
Landon.

01:52.988 --> 01:54.698
In fact, I'm here

01:54.698 --> 01:56.491
so you can finally get
some answers.

02:02.497 --> 02:04.333
When they created
the locks to Malivore,

02:04.333 --> 02:05.917
they also created decoys

02:05.917 --> 02:09.671
so no one would know which three
artifacts were the real thing.

02:09.671 --> 02:11.882
I think you might be able
to help me with that.

02:11.882 --> 02:15.218
Is one of these artifacts
calling to you?

02:15.218 --> 02:17.179
Like a whisper,

02:17.179 --> 02:19.348
an itch?

02:19.348 --> 02:20.974
A) I don't feel
anything.

02:20.974 --> 02:22.768
And B) even if I did,
I'm not helping

02:22.768 --> 02:24.561
the people who kidnapped me.

02:24.561 --> 02:25.896
Oh, this isn't for Triad.

02:25.896 --> 02:28.357
No, they want these artifacts
to stay hidden.

02:28.357 --> 02:30.067
To be clear,

02:30.067 --> 02:32.152
I want to toss them into the pit

02:32.152 --> 02:34.112
and unlock Malivore.

02:34.112 --> 02:35.447
Wow.

02:35.447 --> 02:36.948
Uh...

02:38.367 --> 02:39.534
Thanks for being honest.

02:39.534 --> 02:40.952
That's refreshing.

02:40.952 --> 02:43.372
But now I'm really not going
to help you.

02:43.372 --> 02:45.123
I'll tell you a story.

02:45.123 --> 02:47.334
And at the end of it,
you can decide whether you want

02:47.334 --> 02:48.627
to help me or not.
You think a story

02:48.627 --> 02:50.796
is gonna change my mind?
This one will.

02:50.796 --> 02:54.007
Because it's the story
of your father.

(students gasping)

(chuckling, chattering)

04:14.212 --> 04:16.590
That almost took your head off.

04:18.300 --> 04:19.926
Yo, how long
have I been here?

04:19.926 --> 04:22.429
For an hour. But you've been
going through the motions

04:22.429 --> 04:24.306
like a zombie.

04:24.306 --> 04:25.932
You sure you're okay?

04:25.932 --> 04:28.310
Yeah, I'm fine.
And, look,

04:28.310 --> 04:30.312
you don't need to pretend
like you give a crap about me

04:30.312 --> 04:31.646
just 'cause I'm your alpha.

04:35.525 --> 04:37.527
The game's back on.
Come on.

04:37.527 --> 04:39.112
(answering machine beeps)

04:39.112 --> 04:41.156
LANDON: Hey, Ric.
Sorry to take off like that,

04:41.156 --> 04:42.491
but I just needed a little time.

04:42.491 --> 04:44.493
So I'm going camping
for a while.

04:44.493 --> 04:47.496
Hopefully I can catch up
on classwork later.

04:47.496 --> 04:50.832
Tell Raf and Jed hi for me.

04:50.832 --> 04:51.833
(beeps)

04:51.833 --> 04:53.210
Jed?

04:53.210 --> 04:54.753
Why would he say hi to Jed?

04:54.753 --> 04:55.921
You should go
after him.

04:55.921 --> 04:57.130
Something doesn't make sense.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.007
Hope...
Triad already tried
to come

04:59.007 --> 05:01.134
for him once.
It's not safe for him out there.
We kept

05:01.134 --> 05:03.887
a massive secret from him, and
I think he just needs some time

05:03.887 --> 05:05.847
to process that.
I think we should respect

05:05.847 --> 05:08.225
his privacy and just wait.

05:09.935 --> 05:11.019
(scoffs)

05:12.187 --> 05:14.064
(sighs)

05:14.064 --> 05:15.524
(chuckles)

05:15.524 --> 05:17.651
(door closes)

05:20.237 --> 05:21.613
I know that look.

05:21.613 --> 05:23.114
What's wrong?

05:23.114 --> 05:25.909
These kids have been through
so much lately.

05:25.909 --> 05:28.495
I've done all I can
to help Rafael,

05:28.495 --> 05:31.623
but the side effects of
Hope's elixir are getting worse.

05:31.623 --> 05:33.416
He's losing time,

05:33.416 --> 05:35.043
having flashes of aggression.

05:35.043 --> 05:37.420
I think he's still sliding
between his wolf mind

05:37.420 --> 05:38.588
and his human mind.

05:38.588 --> 05:40.340
I will--
I'll keep an eye on him.

05:40.340 --> 05:42.175
You've been running on fumes
these past few weeks.

05:42.175 --> 05:45.220
It wouldn't hurt to bring in
someone else to help,

05:45.220 --> 05:48.265
maybe even assist in
researching Rafael's condition.

05:48.265 --> 05:50.100
Dorian is too proud
to come back.

05:50.100 --> 05:51.768
You know that.
And you know

05:51.768 --> 05:53.311
how much I respect you.

05:53.311 --> 05:57.816
But are you sure it's his pride
that's the problem?

06:01.778 --> 06:03.780
Was there a monster
attack in here?

06:03.780 --> 06:05.031
There you are.

06:05.031 --> 06:06.366
I got tired of waiting,
so I attempted

06:06.366 --> 06:07.701
a banana cream pie by myself.

06:07.701 --> 06:08.952
Where is it?

06:08.952 --> 06:10.537
In the garbage.
I said "attempted."

06:10.537 --> 06:11.955
So we're gonna go back
to plan A,

06:11.955 --> 06:14.040
and you are gonna make it
for me.

06:14.040 --> 06:16.251
Status update: Josie
didn't come back last night.

06:16.251 --> 06:18.295
I think she slept
in Penelope's old room,

06:18.295 --> 06:21.047
which is a really good way
to get hepatitis B.

06:21.047 --> 06:23.091
Have you slept at all?
You seem a little...

06:23.091 --> 06:25.010
Focused? Motivated? On point?

06:25.010 --> 06:27.804
Sure. Yeah.
Not sleeping
in the same bedroom means

06:27.804 --> 06:29.598
that Twin Forgiveness Cuddle
is off the table.

06:29.598 --> 06:31.641
But she's been holed up
in the library,

06:31.641 --> 06:33.018
so a snack offering
should do the trick.

06:34.352 --> 06:36.855
At some point, you might
actually have to apologize.

06:36.855 --> 06:38.982
(gasps)
Never apologize.

06:38.982 --> 06:40.775
Okay.
Trust me, okay?

06:40.775 --> 06:43.069
This is what we do.
I'm selfish,

06:43.069 --> 06:44.487
then she sulks,

06:44.487 --> 06:46.323
and then I offer baked goods.

06:46.323 --> 06:48.658
Someone else's baked goods.
It's giving you

06:48.658 --> 06:50.619
something to do with yourself,
isn't it?

06:50.619 --> 06:52.162
Your turn for an update.

06:52.162 --> 06:53.913
Any word

06:53.913 --> 06:55.832
from our mop-headed elf?

06:55.832 --> 06:58.335
He says he needs time to think.

06:58.335 --> 07:00.211
Hmm.
I don't know. I feel
like if I could

07:00.211 --> 07:03.340
figure out the right thing
to say, then he'd come back.

07:03.340 --> 07:05.050
So, practice.

07:06.259 --> 07:07.135
Emma has this prism

07:07.135 --> 07:09.679
that simulates a conversation.

07:09.679 --> 07:11.222
She makes me use it

07:11.222 --> 07:14.517
to talk to my mom and my dad
when I'm in a state.

07:14.517 --> 07:17.562
I'll trade you one prism

07:17.562 --> 07:19.898
for a banana cream pie.

07:19.898 --> 07:22.233
(chuckles softly)

07:42.879 --> 07:45.340
I brought you some brain food.

07:45.340 --> 07:46.383
I'm not hungry.

07:47.592 --> 07:49.219
It's all your favorite things.

07:49.219 --> 07:51.388
Which I'm sure
somebody else had to tell you.

07:59.354 --> 08:02.399
LANDON:
No offense, but I'm not gonna
believe anything you say.

08:02.399 --> 08:04.275
I mean,
A-plus for manipulation, man.

08:04.275 --> 08:06.319
This is really
frightening stuff, but...

08:13.910 --> 08:15.745
Where did you get this?

08:15.745 --> 08:17.789
It's all part of what
I'm about to tell you.
Look,

08:17.789 --> 08:19.374
I already know about my dad.

08:19.374 --> 08:21.793
My mom got pregnant by one
of the monsters in Malivore.

08:21.793 --> 08:23.837
Well,

08:23.837 --> 08:26.423
then he'll be easy to spot
in my story.

08:28.591 --> 08:30.260
Around a millennia ago,

08:30.260 --> 08:33.930
in certain parts of the world,
there were monsters.

08:33.930 --> 08:37.100
(shouting)

08:39.394 --> 08:40.937
And in one region...

08:40.937 --> 08:41.938
(screaming)

08:41.938 --> 08:43.314
(screeching)

08:43.314 --> 08:45.817
...there was no monster
more terrifying

08:45.817 --> 08:47.318
than dragons.

08:49.529 --> 08:50.989
(screaming)

08:56.286 --> 08:58.580
On their own,
no faction was any match

08:58.580 --> 09:00.039
for dragons.

09:00.039 --> 09:04.252
So an unholy alliance
was formed.

09:04.252 --> 09:06.254
A witch,

09:06.254 --> 09:08.673
a werewolf and a vampire...

09:08.673 --> 09:11.301
Walked into a bar. I think
I've heard this one before.

09:13.178 --> 09:15.221
Sorry.

09:20.018 --> 09:22.020
CLARKE:
The Triad combined their blood,

09:22.020 --> 09:23.521
using black magic

09:23.521 --> 09:26.858
to create a golem capable
of consuming the dragons.

09:33.364 --> 09:36.367
(growling)

09:36.367 --> 09:40.246
They spelled the creature
to have an insatiable hunger.

09:40.246 --> 09:43.625
But their spell also made it
unable to harm witches,

09:43.625 --> 09:45.627
werewolves, or vampires.

09:45.627 --> 09:48.046
(snarling)

09:48.046 --> 09:50.840
They named it Eater of the Dark.

09:50.840 --> 09:53.218
When the dragons,

09:53.218 --> 09:56.137
in human form, returned
to collect the treasure

09:56.137 --> 09:59.349
from all the villages
they had attacked,

09:59.349 --> 10:01.392
it was waiting for them.

10:01.392 --> 10:02.894
(snarling)

10:05.480 --> 10:07.482
(grunts)

10:07.482 --> 10:09.400
It took them,

10:09.400 --> 10:12.070
consumed them.

10:18.701 --> 10:20.453
To their surprise,

10:20.453 --> 10:22.205
the creature was more effective
than they could have dreamed.

10:22.205 --> 10:24.415
After the dragons were gone,

10:24.415 --> 10:26.251
it kept eating every monster
it could,

10:26.251 --> 10:29.379
swallowing them into
an endless space inside itself.

10:29.379 --> 10:31.297
You're saying
that the golem ate my dad?

10:31.297 --> 10:33.091
No, Landon.

10:33.091 --> 10:35.301
Your father is the golem.

10:36.928 --> 10:39.931
The Eater of the Dark.

10:45.770 --> 10:47.188
Hi.
Hi.

10:47.188 --> 10:49.440
Knock yourself out.

10:49.440 --> 10:51.359
The first time's
kind of freaky,

10:51.359 --> 10:53.736
because you're basically
talking to your subconscious.

10:53.736 --> 10:56.489
Thanks. This is for you.

10:56.489 --> 10:58.283
I saw your dad reading it.
He keeps it

10:58.283 --> 11:00.618
locked up in his office,
so it's bound to have something

11:00.618 --> 11:02.328
about that Merge thing
Josie's looking for.

11:02.328 --> 11:04.664
For once, your weird
relationship with my dad

11:04.664 --> 11:06.666
actually comes in handy.

11:06.666 --> 11:09.002
Right. Uh, just be careful.

11:09.002 --> 11:11.129
If your dad's
hiding something,

11:11.129 --> 11:13.464
I'm sure it's for
a good reason.

11:13.464 --> 11:15.466
I'm sure I can handle it,
whatever it is.

11:15.466 --> 11:18.845
I just have this feeling
that everything is gonna
work out just fine.

11:18.845 --> 11:21.347
Can you feel it? It's like
the whole school is vibrating.

11:21.347 --> 11:24.601
(takes deep breath)
We're both gonna get
our people back.

11:34.652 --> 11:36.571
(birds chirping)

11:40.533 --> 11:42.702
(whooshing, chiming)

11:51.920 --> 11:53.838
Hey there.

11:53.838 --> 11:55.965
(laughs):
Hey.

11:57.926 --> 11:59.552
Are you okay?

11:59.552 --> 12:00.553
Yeah.

12:00.553 --> 12:02.013
Yeah. Sorry.

12:02.013 --> 12:03.514
Um...

12:03.514 --> 12:07.018
this is my first time talking
to a magical hologram.

12:07.018 --> 12:09.270
Hologram?

12:09.270 --> 12:10.688
What do you mean, a hologram?
What does that mean?

12:10.688 --> 12:12.941
That I'm not real?
What are you talking about?

12:12.941 --> 12:14.400
(laughs)

12:14.400 --> 12:15.610
Oh, my God, don't do that.

12:15.610 --> 12:17.028
Sorry.
Yeah.

12:17.028 --> 12:19.113
You just seemed tense.
I was trying to break the ice.

12:19.113 --> 12:22.700
Well, at least I know this is a
pretty accurate version of you.

12:22.700 --> 12:24.452
You can thank yourself
for that, I guess.

12:24.452 --> 12:27.205
You had something you
wanted to say to me?

12:27.205 --> 12:29.082
Yeah. Um...

12:29.082 --> 12:31.250
I should have told you
about your mom

12:31.250 --> 12:32.752
and-and the whole thing earlier.

12:32.752 --> 12:36.005
I mean, I was just trying
to protect you from being hurt.

12:36.005 --> 12:37.507
So I just wanted to say

12:37.507 --> 12:41.135
that I'm sorry if I hurt you.

12:41.135 --> 12:43.262
What, that's it?

12:43.262 --> 12:45.014
You're "sorry if

12:45.014 --> 12:46.140
I hurt you"?

12:46.140 --> 12:47.558
I am.
Okay, then I

12:47.558 --> 12:49.352
accept your apology if
you're actually sorry.

12:49.352 --> 12:50.812
What's your problem?
I mean, do you

12:50.812 --> 12:52.271
seriously think that speech
would have worked on me?

12:52.271 --> 12:53.690
I mean, come on,
that's not what you

12:53.690 --> 12:55.316
actually wanted to say.
How would you know?

12:55.316 --> 12:56.442
Because I am you, remember?

12:56.442 --> 12:58.236
(sighs)
Fine.

12:58.236 --> 13:00.655
Then you tell me what it is that
I want to say, and I'll say it.

13:00.655 --> 13:02.657
That's not how this works, Hope.
You have to listen.

13:02.657 --> 13:03.783
Listen to what?

13:03.783 --> 13:05.118
(whooshing)

13:06.202 --> 13:08.955
Even fake you is infuriating.

13:08.955 --> 13:10.206
God!

13:10.206 --> 13:12.083
How can something
that's basically

13:12.083 --> 13:14.377
a mud robot
be my father?

13:15.837 --> 13:18.673
Because it
didn't stay a golem.

13:18.673 --> 13:22.135
With each monster's DNA
it absorbed...

13:22.135 --> 13:23.636
it evolved.

13:23.636 --> 13:26.848
Eventually,
it became sentient...

13:26.848 --> 13:29.350
aware.

13:29.350 --> 13:31.978
He was truly alive.

13:31.978 --> 13:34.063
And when the region
was cleared of all the monsters,

13:34.063 --> 13:36.357
the Triad wanted
to return him back to mud.

13:36.357 --> 13:38.151
Since they were the ones
who created him,

13:38.151 --> 13:40.028
only they could destroy him.

13:40.028 --> 13:42.780
All they needed to do
was wipe away the symbol

13:42.780 --> 13:44.198
on his forehead.

13:44.198 --> 13:45.825
(growling)

13:47.702 --> 13:49.954
But he betrayed his creators.

13:49.954 --> 13:54.417
He made a deal
with all the humans he'd saved.

13:54.417 --> 13:56.961
They could not let
their new god

13:56.961 --> 13:58.713
be taken from them.

13:58.713 --> 14:01.924
The humans set him free
to wander the earth
and continue consuming,

14:01.924 --> 14:05.720
erasing all memory
that the monsters ever existed.

14:08.765 --> 14:10.850
But over time...

14:10.850 --> 14:13.352
like Adam
in the Garden of Eden,

14:13.352 --> 14:16.397
he realized he was alone.

14:16.397 --> 14:19.859
So he did what all creations
eventually do.

14:21.944 --> 14:23.696
Create.

14:24.697 --> 14:26.866
He fashioned beings like him.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.659
His children.

14:28.659 --> 14:30.745
A lineage that could...
LANDON: Man...

14:30.745 --> 14:32.747
You were doing so good
up until that part.

14:32.747 --> 14:35.166
I was almost into it,
as far as origin stories go,

14:35.166 --> 14:36.751
but you're asking me
to believe that I'm

14:36.751 --> 14:39.420
a magical mud man
with implanted memories.

14:41.881 --> 14:43.925
Quite the opposite.

14:43.925 --> 14:45.510
You see...

14:45.510 --> 14:47.845
all the children he
fashioned were imperfect.

14:47.845 --> 14:50.389
Flawed. None of them
had his powers.

14:50.389 --> 14:52.934
All of them had weaknesses
and all were sterile,

14:52.934 --> 14:56.896
unable to reproduce
and continue his legacy.

14:59.774 --> 15:03.277
He was created to be the
only one of his kind.

15:03.277 --> 15:05.696
He was never intended
to be a species

15:05.696 --> 15:08.366
or have a bloodline
of his own.

15:10.243 --> 15:11.953
But...

15:11.953 --> 15:15.248
he found a way to
reproduce biologically.

15:17.250 --> 15:20.211
To have a son who
was part human.

15:20.211 --> 15:22.755
A son who was perfect.

15:24.006 --> 15:26.092
A son who could
live forever

15:26.092 --> 15:27.927
and continue the species.

15:27.927 --> 15:31.430
You are what he's been trying
to create his entire life.

15:42.358 --> 15:44.485
I was trying
to be all coy.

15:44.485 --> 15:47.989
Here. It's a secret book
from Dad's study--
I know you're looking into

15:47.989 --> 15:49.198
this Merge crap,

15:49.198 --> 15:52.285
so I just want
a little credit for helping.

15:52.285 --> 15:54.704
Did you stop to think that
maybe I didn't want your help,

15:54.704 --> 15:55.997
that maybe I
wanted something,

15:55.997 --> 15:58.207
anything that was
entirely my own?

15:58.207 --> 16:00.418
Is this about having
separate rooms?

16:00.418 --> 16:02.003
That's fine, okay?
Just take Penelope's.

16:02.003 --> 16:04.422
You seriously
still don't get it.

16:04.422 --> 16:06.090
This isn't about needing space.

16:06.090 --> 16:08.551
This is about
every waking moment of my life

16:08.551 --> 16:09.969
being suffocated by you.

16:09.969 --> 16:11.804
We shouldn't just
have our own rooms.

16:11.804 --> 16:14.182
We should have our own lives.

16:14.182 --> 16:16.517
We should be our own people.

16:18.019 --> 16:20.188
LANDON: You know, I've told
my fair share of lies,

16:20.188 --> 16:23.441
and the best lie is one
that someone already
wants to believe.

16:23.441 --> 16:25.484
And you're asking
me to believe that

16:25.484 --> 16:27.695
the father that I've
been looking for for years

16:27.695 --> 16:30.031
has actually
been searching for me?

16:31.657 --> 16:33.534
Why should I believe you?

16:33.534 --> 16:35.369
Because I was there.

16:35.369 --> 16:37.455
Over the years,
his attempts at children

16:37.455 --> 16:39.498
became more refined,

16:39.498 --> 16:42.210
indistinguishable
from humans.

16:42.210 --> 16:45.463
Our father is
a very gifted artist.

16:45.463 --> 16:47.256
Our father?

16:47.256 --> 16:48.549
Yes...

16:48.549 --> 16:50.343
little brother.

16:50.343 --> 16:52.345
Like I said...

16:53.679 --> 16:56.349
(growling)
...I was there.

17:09.403 --> 17:10.571
Breathe. Stay calm.

17:10.571 --> 17:13.532
No, no, don't do this.

17:13.532 --> 17:14.617
(crackling)
(panting)

17:14.617 --> 17:16.744
(loud clang)
(grunts)

17:19.121 --> 17:20.498
Hey, are you okay?

17:20.498 --> 17:21.499
Stay back.

17:21.499 --> 17:22.750
It's fine.
It'll pass.

17:22.750 --> 17:24.210
Just...
What do we do?
Do we need

17:24.210 --> 17:25.920
to do the yelling-
in-the-woods thing?
No,

17:25.920 --> 17:28.381
I just, I need to find out
what this Merge thing is, okay?

17:28.381 --> 17:29.590
I feel like
it's a spell

17:29.590 --> 17:31.425
that she's gonna use
to just leave

17:31.425 --> 17:32.635
or break us up
or something!

17:32.635 --> 17:34.762
(crackling stops)

17:34.762 --> 17:37.390
All right, deep breaths.
Deep breaths.

17:37.390 --> 17:39.600
I'll call my Aunt Freya-- she'll
know something about the Merge.

17:39.600 --> 17:41.143
Okay?
Okay.

17:41.143 --> 17:42.478
Okay.

17:44.772 --> 17:47.733
(young women laughing)

17:47.733 --> 17:49.193
Hey.

17:49.193 --> 17:53.030
Shouldn't you be hanging out
with your new best friend?

17:53.030 --> 17:54.740
Oh, that's actually
why I'm here.

17:54.740 --> 17:57.201
I-I think some sort
of crash is brewing.

17:57.201 --> 17:59.578
Then you should stay away.

18:01.539 --> 18:04.625
Um, look, I know that
you're mad at her,

18:04.625 --> 18:07.587
but... she's still
your sister,

18:07.587 --> 18:10.172
and she really
needs your help.
Why?

18:10.172 --> 18:11.924
She did this to herself.

18:11.924 --> 18:14.385
What? She can't control
her brain chemistry.

18:14.385 --> 18:16.262
She can choose to take
her medication.

18:16.262 --> 18:18.931
She hasn't taken it
since we saw her mom,
because she doesn't like

18:18.931 --> 18:20.766
the way that
it makes her feel.

18:20.766 --> 18:22.727
So she tried
magical bracelets

18:22.727 --> 18:24.145
and releasing her inner bitch

18:24.145 --> 18:26.147
and then distracting herself
with Miss Mystic Falls,

18:26.147 --> 18:28.566
but all of that is
just delaying the inevitable.

18:28.566 --> 18:30.568
Letting her crash
is the only way

18:30.568 --> 18:32.862
anything will ever change.

18:46.542 --> 18:47.543
(thumps)

18:47.543 --> 18:48.544
Watch it, wolf.

18:48.544 --> 18:50.254
What'd you say to me?

18:50.254 --> 18:51.797
I said, watch it...

18:51.797 --> 18:53.132
wolf.

18:53.132 --> 18:55.885
(growling)

18:57.386 --> 18:58.512
Get your vampires

18:58.512 --> 19:00.264
out of my face.
Hey, hey, hey!

19:00.264 --> 19:01.265
Stand down.

19:01.265 --> 19:02.850
Get off of me!

19:02.850 --> 19:03.893
Whoa!

19:05.853 --> 19:08.564
JED:
Hey! Hey, wolves, stand down!

19:08.564 --> 19:10.107
Now!

19:11.192 --> 19:12.568
Enough!

19:14.820 --> 19:17.281
(indistinct chatter)

19:19.408 --> 19:21.619
(Alaric groaning)

19:23.788 --> 19:25.039
Dr. Saltzman.

19:25.039 --> 19:26.248
EMMA:
Everyone back to class.

19:26.248 --> 19:27.541
Clear the way, please.

19:27.541 --> 19:29.126
I'm sorry.
EMMA: Coming through.

19:38.761 --> 19:40.137
(whooshing)
(sighs)

19:41.389 --> 19:43.140
Hey, Hope. What's going on?
Don't pretend like

19:43.140 --> 19:44.767
you don't remember
our last conversation.
I just figured

19:44.767 --> 19:46.185
you'd want a fresh start.

19:46.185 --> 19:48.938
Oh. Guess even my subconscious
can get stuff wrong.

19:48.938 --> 19:50.314
Touché.

19:50.314 --> 19:52.942
So, did you figure out
what you wanted to say yet?

19:52.942 --> 19:55.069
Uh, yeah,
actually, I did.

19:55.069 --> 19:57.947
And what I wanted
to say is this: I have
been protecting you

19:57.947 --> 20:00.074
and putting your safety first
ever since you got here.

20:00.074 --> 20:02.618
So what was I supposed to do
with this secret? Hmm?

20:02.618 --> 20:04.203
Just stop
protecting you?

20:04.203 --> 20:06.455
I know exactly what it
feels like to be an orphan.

20:06.455 --> 20:08.457
Okay? I was saving
you from that.
So you can be mad

20:08.457 --> 20:11.127
at me, but I was doing it
because I care about you.
No.

20:11.127 --> 20:13.129
You were doing it because
you didn't want me to leave.

20:13.129 --> 20:16.465
Because you fear
being abandoned, like
how your mom left

20:16.465 --> 20:18.634
and your dad left--
it's why you run.

20:18.634 --> 20:20.428
This has nothing to do
with my parents.

20:20.428 --> 20:21.721
Then why did you
start crying

20:21.721 --> 20:23.806
when you wore a dress
your dad picked out?

20:24.890 --> 20:27.017
Whoa. We're done.

20:27.017 --> 20:28.602
Hope, you're not listening.

20:28.602 --> 20:29.603
(whooshing)

20:29.603 --> 20:33.149
My father saw himself in me.

20:33.149 --> 20:36.986
I was clay pretending to be
something it wasn't.

20:36.986 --> 20:38.821
He despised me for it.

20:38.821 --> 20:42.950
He threw me away like all the
other failures who came before.

20:42.950 --> 20:45.035
I know what that's like.

20:45.035 --> 20:47.580
Then you'll understand
why I betrayed him.

20:47.580 --> 20:49.707
(growling)

20:51.208 --> 20:54.003
Our father consumed
every creature he could.

20:54.003 --> 20:57.631
And when his supply ran out,
he grew weak...

20:57.631 --> 20:59.008
vulnerable.

20:59.008 --> 21:02.136
And that's when
the humans came back.

21:04.013 --> 21:06.474
The descendants
of his original worshippers,

21:06.474 --> 21:07.808
a secret society.

21:07.808 --> 21:09.852
I told them

21:09.852 --> 21:11.604
of his attempts
to create a lineage,

21:11.604 --> 21:15.608
how he was violating nature,
trying to birth a new species.

21:15.608 --> 21:18.194
I led them to him.

21:18.194 --> 21:20.738
And they did what humans do.

21:20.738 --> 21:24.366
They rebelled
against their god.

21:24.366 --> 21:27.369
They paid witches who used
black magic to trap him...

21:27.369 --> 21:29.997
(roars)

21:29.997 --> 21:31.540
...and dissolve him,

21:31.540 --> 21:34.293
returning him
to his natural state.

21:34.960 --> 21:37.755
The black pit.

21:37.755 --> 21:41.509
The endless darkness
where the monsters are.

21:41.509 --> 21:44.178
It's not just a place.

21:44.178 --> 21:47.181
It's what remains
of our father.

21:47.181 --> 21:49.642
The Eater of the Dark.

21:49.642 --> 21:52.311
His name is...
Malivore.

21:57.149 --> 21:59.568
You don't believe me.

21:59.568 --> 22:02.947
Would you believe you?

22:02.947 --> 22:04.949
Probably not.

22:04.949 --> 22:06.825
Then again,

22:06.825 --> 22:09.078
I've never stolen an artifact
without even knowing

22:09.078 --> 22:10.829
why I did it.

22:10.829 --> 22:12.665
The knife and the
urn were both part

22:12.665 --> 22:14.083
of the spell that
dissolved him.

22:14.083 --> 22:16.627
But since he was immortal...
Nothing's immortal.

22:16.627 --> 22:18.963
There's always a loophole.
Nature creates a balance.

22:20.339 --> 22:21.632
That's Intro to Magical History.

22:21.632 --> 22:23.759
I've been taking it
for, like, a week.

22:23.759 --> 22:25.844
Very good.

22:25.844 --> 22:28.639
But until that loophole
could be found,

22:28.639 --> 22:30.683
they bound him
with three locks.

22:30.683 --> 22:33.018
Created three decoys.

22:33.018 --> 22:36.105
It can only be unlocked
by Malivore's blood,

22:36.105 --> 22:38.524
so they hid them far away.

22:39.191 --> 22:40.651
I've been able

22:40.651 --> 22:43.404
to track down where
the last four artifacts are.

22:44.947 --> 22:47.950
Now I need you to tell me
which is the real lock

22:47.950 --> 22:49.910
so we can set him free.

22:55.749 --> 22:57.585
This could have
gotten out of hand.

22:57.585 --> 23:00.087
Yeah, but... it didn't.

23:00.087 --> 23:02.548
And Raf apologized.

23:02.548 --> 23:03.924
You're a good man, Ric.

23:03.924 --> 23:05.926
(sighs, chuckles)
But you're human.

23:05.926 --> 23:08.095
How long until these
kids figure out

23:08.095 --> 23:10.848
that the control you have of
this school is an illusion?

23:10.848 --> 23:13.892
Before there's a fight
you cannot stop?

23:15.769 --> 23:19.106
I finally realized
what I can do to help.

23:21.525 --> 23:23.861
I'm taking a sabbatical.

23:24.945 --> 23:26.697
But...

23:26.697 --> 23:28.657
but how is that
supposed to help?

23:28.657 --> 23:30.993
I'm hoping it'll
be a wake-up call.

23:30.993 --> 23:34.455
The mission of this
school has grown.

23:35.331 --> 23:37.458
And I don't want to be here

23:37.458 --> 23:41.795
when it gets bad enough for
you to finally admit that.

23:58.354 --> 24:00.481
(door opens)

24:03.233 --> 24:05.611
What do you want?

24:05.611 --> 24:07.029
I came to get some stuff,

24:07.029 --> 24:08.697
but I guess
I'll come back later.

24:08.697 --> 24:10.157
No, it's fine.

24:10.157 --> 24:11.408
Take whatever you need.

24:11.408 --> 24:13.369
Don't worry about me.

24:13.369 --> 24:14.536
Are you kidding me?

24:14.536 --> 24:16.246
All I've ever done

24:16.246 --> 24:17.623
is worry about you.

24:17.623 --> 24:19.166
Oh, here we go. The whole

24:19.166 --> 24:21.835
"I'm tired of being
in Lizzie's shadow" speech?

24:21.835 --> 24:25.255
Well, guess what.
Codependency takes two people.

24:25.255 --> 24:27.591
Yes, I'm awful and needy,

24:27.591 --> 24:30.344
but deep down,
you're happy to hide

24:30.344 --> 24:33.013
and let me be the one
that they hate

24:33.013 --> 24:35.683
because you're too scared
to be yourself.

24:37.101 --> 24:39.853
You are as much a part
of this cycle as I am.

24:39.853 --> 24:42.147
You're upset. I'll come back

24:42.147 --> 24:43.857
for the part where you beg me
to forgive you.

24:52.491 --> 24:53.909
Descanto!
Reboundus!

25:02.418 --> 25:03.627
(screams)

25:04.962 --> 25:06.505
(grunts)

25:08.590 --> 25:11.051
(gasps)

25:12.136 --> 25:14.054
I'm sorry.

25:21.729 --> 25:22.938
You need to
get some help.

25:22.938 --> 25:24.898
Don't pretend
that you care about me.

25:24.898 --> 25:26.692
I don't.

25:26.692 --> 25:28.652
I care about the pack.

25:28.652 --> 25:31.113
They follow their alpha.

25:31.113 --> 25:33.323
And having an alpha who
can't control himself

25:33.323 --> 25:35.325
means the pack gets hurt.

25:35.325 --> 25:36.910
Look,

25:36.910 --> 25:39.747
I was a dick as a leader.

25:39.747 --> 25:42.332
So take it from someone
who lost what you have.

25:42.332 --> 25:44.877
The pack is everything.

25:44.877 --> 25:47.713
If you care about them,

25:47.713 --> 25:51.133
you won't let your pride
get in the way like I did.

25:58.640 --> 26:00.934
I need to talk
to you about Raf.

26:00.934 --> 26:02.352
I have to say something first.

26:02.352 --> 26:03.812
Freya just explained the Merge.

26:03.812 --> 26:06.398
Josie's pretty much
figured it out,

26:06.398 --> 26:08.484
and, uh, Lizzie is spiraling.

26:08.484 --> 26:09.818
So, either you
do it or I will,

26:09.818 --> 26:12.237
but it's time
to tell them the truth.

26:14.656 --> 26:15.991
If you're the one
who betrayed him,

26:15.991 --> 26:17.576
why are you trying
to set him free now?

26:17.576 --> 26:21.205
Because I chose the wrong side.

26:26.126 --> 26:29.129
The pit had the same properties
as Malivore.

26:30.798 --> 26:33.258
Throw a monster in, its memory
was erased from existence.

26:34.927 --> 26:37.554
Within a few years,
the secret society

26:37.554 --> 26:39.848
grew into a business.

26:40.724 --> 26:42.392
Triad Industries.

26:42.392 --> 26:44.061
Keeping the world safe
from all the things

26:44.061 --> 26:45.354
that go bump in the night.

26:46.438 --> 26:47.981
It's monster cleaning.

26:50.192 --> 26:52.778
Eventually,
the power corrupted them.

26:52.778 --> 26:55.072
(distorted screaming)

26:55.072 --> 26:57.866
Monsters became
whoever they didn't like.

27:00.869 --> 27:02.704
Whoever they wanted
to be forgotten.

27:09.002 --> 27:12.381
I thought revenge on my father
would feel sweeter,

27:12.381 --> 27:14.341
but it didn't.

27:17.636 --> 27:19.429
So I returned myself to him.

27:19.429 --> 27:23.392
I knew
I had to make things right.

27:23.392 --> 27:25.185
Inside Malivore,

27:25.185 --> 27:26.728
there was only darkness.

27:27.604 --> 27:30.107
I yelled, I screamed,

27:30.107 --> 27:32.067
but he would not answer me.

27:32.067 --> 27:36.405
He let me sit in silence,
punishing me until...

27:36.405 --> 27:37.948
decades later,

27:37.948 --> 27:40.659
when suddenly
he spit me out.

27:40.659 --> 27:43.245
I didn't know why

27:43.245 --> 27:46.039
till I found that
picture of you.

27:46.039 --> 27:47.916
And I saw a
video of a knife

27:47.916 --> 27:50.586
that could only be unlocked
by Malivore's blood.

27:50.586 --> 27:53.213
And I heard story

27:53.213 --> 27:56.008
of a woman who had emerged
from the pit pregnant.

27:57.426 --> 27:58.886
As more humans were thrown in,

27:58.886 --> 28:00.637
he absorbed enough
of their genetic material

28:00.637 --> 28:02.097
to be able to reproduce.

28:02.097 --> 28:03.765
When Triad betrayed
your mother,

28:03.765 --> 28:07.436
our father had mercy on her
and sent her back...

28:07.436 --> 28:09.855
carrying you.

28:11.440 --> 28:14.026
He sent me back to find you

28:14.026 --> 28:17.279
because only you are
blood of his blood.

28:17.279 --> 28:19.072
And only you

28:19.072 --> 28:21.158
can set him free.

33:16.786 --> 33:19.831
I mean, I went into the woods,
but I didn't take my journal?

33:19.831 --> 33:21.333
Or any camping gear.

33:21.333 --> 33:24.002
I left clues in the voice mail
that something wasn't right.

33:24.002 --> 33:25.837
I called Dr. Saltzman "Ric."

33:25.837 --> 33:29.007
I would never do that.
You said hi to... Jed.

33:29.007 --> 33:31.927
Last time I said hey to Jed,
he beat the crap out of me.

33:31.927 --> 33:34.888
I was trying to tell you
that something wasn't right.
What happened?

33:34.888 --> 33:36.431
Hope...

33:36.431 --> 33:39.601
for the last time,
just listen.

33:43.063 --> 33:45.482
LANDON:
Hey, Ric,
sorry to take off like that,

33:45.482 --> 33:47.484
but I just needed
a little time,

33:47.484 --> 33:48.985
so I'm going camping
for a while.

33:48.985 --> 33:50.403
(footsteps)
I can hear...

33:50.403 --> 33:51.905
Hopefully, I can catch up
on classwork later.

33:51.905 --> 33:53.198
...shoes on a tile floor.

33:53.198 --> 33:55.158
An air conditioner
running.

33:55.158 --> 33:56.493
Tell Raf and Jed hi for me.

33:56.493 --> 33:58.036
(chirping)
Keycards being swiped.

33:58.036 --> 33:59.371
Mm, Triad.

33:59.371 --> 34:00.747
I mean, it has to be them.

34:00.747 --> 34:02.374
They've already tried
to come for him once.

34:02.374 --> 34:03.917
What are you gonna do?

34:03.917 --> 34:05.252
(sighs)

34:05.252 --> 34:07.671
I'm gonna go full Wonder Woman,
that's what.

34:07.671 --> 34:09.589
Do you need any help?
No.

34:09.589 --> 34:11.758
I've already got my Super Squad.

34:11.758 --> 34:14.302
But thank you
for everything.

34:14.302 --> 34:16.763
Hey, uh...

34:16.763 --> 34:19.808
Ric said I should probably
head back out into the field,

34:19.808 --> 34:21.768
and I was actually coming
to find you and say goodbye

34:21.768 --> 34:24.562
earlier, but, uh,
then I heard you on the dock.

34:24.562 --> 34:26.481
Can't turn off
my vamp hearing.

34:26.481 --> 34:28.733
I wasn't trying to spy
or anything.

34:28.733 --> 34:29.985
(clears throat)

34:29.985 --> 34:32.904
You're not a mistake, okay?

34:32.904 --> 34:34.823
The cosmos is lucky to have you.

34:34.823 --> 34:36.199
So is Landon.

34:36.199 --> 34:37.826
He'll figure that out.

34:40.912 --> 34:43.873
CLARKE:
There's really only one thing
you have to decide.

34:45.500 --> 34:47.585
Will you help me?

34:48.795 --> 34:50.797
Help release Malivore
and destroy the world?

34:50.797 --> 34:52.507
He's been alive
for centuries.

34:52.507 --> 34:54.259
Was the world destroyed?

34:54.259 --> 34:56.594
Or was it balanced

34:56.594 --> 35:00.390
and safer without all these
creatures running around?

35:00.390 --> 35:02.767
Ask yourself-- who's
the real bad guy here?

35:02.767 --> 35:05.645
Our father was designed
for a purpose.

35:07.647 --> 35:10.150
It's his programming.
He can't control that.

35:10.150 --> 35:11.568
But all the monsters
he swallowed

35:11.568 --> 35:13.486
are still alive
inside of him.

35:14.946 --> 35:17.699
Did your friends keep
any of them alive?

35:18.908 --> 35:20.452
Or did they just kill
every creature

35:20.452 --> 35:22.245
they couldn't control?

35:22.245 --> 35:24.497
Malivore can't hurt

35:24.497 --> 35:27.250
witches, werewolves,
or vampires, remember?

35:27.250 --> 35:29.252
Your friends
at the school--

35:29.252 --> 35:31.338
they aren't in any
danger from him.

35:31.338 --> 35:34.299
But they are in danger
from Triad.

35:35.967 --> 35:38.511
You know what goes on
in this building?

35:38.511 --> 35:40.805
What kind of secret
experiments they run

35:40.805 --> 35:43.141
in their mad
scientist labs?

35:43.141 --> 35:46.644
They're finding a way
to turn the pit into a weapon.

35:46.644 --> 35:48.813
They're chemically
altering it

35:48.813 --> 35:51.316
so it can be used
against the protected species.

35:51.316 --> 35:54.444
Ending supernaturals
once and for all.

35:56.154 --> 35:58.156
You want to save
your friends?

35:58.156 --> 36:00.825
You have to stop Triad.

36:04.662 --> 36:06.498
Landon,

36:06.498 --> 36:09.542
no matter what they
say at that school...

36:10.710 --> 36:12.670
...you're not one of them.

36:12.670 --> 36:16.132
And you know that,
too, don't you?

36:16.132 --> 36:19.761
I'm offering you
a family who actually wants you.

36:21.763 --> 36:24.015
We can raise our father.

36:26.685 --> 36:30.021
And we can destroy Triad.

36:33.441 --> 36:36.069
What's it gonna be?

36:45.870 --> 36:47.789
This one.

37:00.051 --> 37:01.970
(liquid gurgling)

37:06.975 --> 37:09.436
It was the only
thing in his desk.

37:11.104 --> 37:13.022
He's one of them.

37:13.022 --> 37:16.192
Security found an old pipe that
they must've escaped through.

37:16.192 --> 37:18.778
There's no record of it
on any ground plans.

37:18.778 --> 37:21.781
They lost their
trail, but...

37:21.781 --> 37:23.616
they did find this.

37:23.616 --> 37:27.662
♪ We could start from the top
before we were hopeless... ♪

37:27.662 --> 37:29.956
I know where they're going.

it's been quite a while... ♪

37:34.127 --> 37:36.754
ALARIC:
You know, in the beginning,
there was balance.

37:38.131 --> 37:40.550
You know, when Caroline and I
opened the school,

37:40.550 --> 37:42.177
it made sense.

37:42.177 --> 37:45.096
Then it was...

37:45.096 --> 37:47.474
it was just me, and...

37:47.474 --> 37:49.559
and I-I.. I thought
I was strong enough

37:49.559 --> 37:51.227
to manage it alone.

37:51.227 --> 37:53.396
But I just...

37:53.396 --> 37:55.482
made so many mistakes.

37:55.482 --> 37:59.152
I thought if I just kept moving,
I could outrun them, you know?

37:59.152 --> 38:02.363
But they caught up to me.

38:02.363 --> 38:05.492
I guess what
I'm trying to say... is,

38:05.492 --> 38:07.327
I need your help.

38:07.327 --> 38:10.580
You know, this school is
bigger than you and me.

38:10.580 --> 38:12.582
And these kids--
they need leaders

38:12.582 --> 38:14.334
who can admit
their mistakes.

38:14.334 --> 38:18.671
And so I am here
to say I'm sorry.

38:18.671 --> 38:20.215
I am sorry
I kissed Emma.

38:22.008 --> 38:26.179
And I'm sorry I didn't talk
to you sooner about it.

38:26.179 --> 38:28.723
♪ Whoa ♪

38:28.723 --> 38:30.600
♪ Amen, amen ♪
♪ Whoa... ♪

38:30.600 --> 38:33.061
You know, for a long time,
I thought that I was only

38:33.061 --> 38:35.605
at the school because of
what happened to my family.

38:35.605 --> 38:37.398
So that we could keep
supernaturals

38:37.398 --> 38:39.234
from growing up
to be killers.

38:39.234 --> 38:41.361

Hello to you, too,
uh, and, no, you're not.

39:12.392 --> 39:15.144
Look, last time you did this
without me, it was a disaster.

39:15.144 --> 39:17.313
Except I'm not gonna go alone
this time.

39:17.313 --> 39:19.232
I'm gonna draft the twins, MG,

39:19.232 --> 39:21.526
Kaleb. We're going
before Dr. Saltzman comes back.

39:21.526 --> 39:22.652
It'll be like
a Super Squad Assemble.

39:22.652 --> 39:24.654
I don't know.
Is that a thing?

39:24.654 --> 39:26.072
I don't know.
I'll ask MG.

39:26.072 --> 39:27.782
Yeah, I'll ask
him myself.

39:27.782 --> 39:30.243
Raf, Dr. Saltzman told me

39:30.243 --> 39:34.747
about the side effects. I'm
sorry, but I can't let you come.

39:35.790 --> 39:37.625
(quietly):
How do you feel now?

39:43.006 --> 39:44.257
(scoffs)

39:44.257 --> 39:46.259
Like my brain's
split down the middle.

39:48.303 --> 39:51.890
I keep having these flashes like
I can't control myself, and...

39:51.890 --> 39:54.267
That's why you're not coming
on the mission.

39:58.771 --> 40:01.858
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

40:05.528 --> 40:07.822
You know why.

40:07.822 --> 40:10.241
(sighs)
Raf...

40:10.241 --> 40:13.828
I don't know
how to be around you, Hope.

40:13.828 --> 40:16.331
I don't want to
feel this way,

40:16.331 --> 40:18.082
so I push it down,

40:18.082 --> 40:20.710
and that just makes the
split in my brain worse,

40:20.710 --> 40:22.712
which makes it
harder to hide.

40:22.712 --> 40:24.797
And the only person
that I want to talk

40:24.797 --> 40:27.925
about it with is the
only person I can't.

40:31.054 --> 40:32.847
Raf...

40:32.847 --> 40:34.891
you're a good brother.

40:34.891 --> 40:38.519
But for once, you need
to put yourself first.

40:38.519 --> 40:41.689
Do what you need
to get better.

40:41.689 --> 40:44.359
If things get really bad...

40:49.739 --> 40:52.575
(sighs)
...use this.

40:52.575 --> 40:54.285
It's a long story, but, um,

40:54.285 --> 40:57.830
it was a gift
from a family friend.

40:57.830 --> 40:59.957
But it's essentially like
a reverse kyanite ring.

40:59.957 --> 41:02.251
When you use it,
you can turn yourself at will.

41:02.251 --> 41:05.672
In your wolf mind,
things are less complicated.

41:05.672 --> 41:07.590
You know that.

41:07.590 --> 41:09.884
It'll buy you time to heal.

41:09.884 --> 41:11.886
Only catch is, um,

41:11.886 --> 41:14.555
you can't
turn yourself back, so,

41:14.555 --> 41:16.891
if you do use it,

41:16.891 --> 41:18.393
all you have to do is
come find me

41:18.393 --> 41:20.687
when you're ready
to be yourself again.

41:23.064 --> 41:24.732
I am

41:24.732 --> 41:27.402
really glad I know you...

41:27.402 --> 41:29.445
Hope Mikaelson.

41:29.445 --> 41:31.572
(laughs)
Now,

41:31.572 --> 41:33.741
go.

41:33.741 --> 41:35.535
Go save our boy.

41:35.535 --> 41:37.078
(laughs)

41:37.078 --> 41:39.580
And don't let anything
stop you.

41:39.580 --> 41:42.083
(garbled radio transmission)

41:45.336 --> 41:47.046
Move, move!
