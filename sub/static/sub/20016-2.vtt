39:08.133 --> 39:11.266
I'm very confused right now,

39:11.267 --> 39:12.966
and the sea's confusing.

39:12.967 --> 39:14.332
I'm tired as hell.

39:14.333 --> 39:16.367
- I'm about ready.
- To throw in the white flag.

39:19.633 --> 39:21.517
But I can do this.

39:21.518 --> 39:23.399
We can do this thing.

39:23.400 --> 39:24.517
This is what

39:24.518 --> 39:25.632
we signed up for.

39:25.633 --> 39:27.033

40:00.935 --> 40:02.099
That was barely moving.

- Let me see how many.
- Fingers you got.

40:03.970 --> 40:05.550

40:05.551 --> 40:07.132

slammed into the bow,

40:16.200 --> 40:17.434
taking the captain and crew

40:17.435 --> 40:18.667
by surprise.

40:22.100 --> 40:23.800
- I don't know where the [Bleep]
- That wave came from,

40:23.803 --> 40:24.867
But it was doing,

40:24.868 --> 40:25.932
like, 30 knots.

40:25.933 --> 40:27.100
It was like getting hit

40:27.101 --> 40:28.266
by a [Bleep] train.

40:28.267 --> 40:29.300
It had to have been

40:29.301 --> 40:30.332
a pretty big wave.

40:30.333 --> 40:32.499
There's some big ones out here.

40:32.500 --> 40:35.799
Definitely got to be careful.

Johnathan: We don't need

40:37.001 --> 40:38.199
that [Bleep] happening to us.

40:38.200 --> 40:40.366
That was [Bleep] up.

40:46.533 --> 40:48.200
- we're just going to put this one.
- In the launcher.

40:48.203 --> 40:49.833
Leave this one in the launcher.

40:52.000 --> 40:53.533
- Narrator:
- Johnathan shuts down.

40:53.536 --> 40:55.000
And waits

40:55.001 --> 40:56.466
for the weather to break.

40:56.467 --> 40:57.834
So let's take care

40:57.835 --> 40:59.199
of the crab,

40:59.200 --> 41:02.399
batter down, and come on in.

You can't tell

41:07.770 --> 41:08.866

41:08.867 --> 41:10.834
There's a random rogue wave,

41:10.835 --> 41:12.799
it could take all of us out.

41:12.800 --> 41:14.000
So if he says

41:14.001 --> 41:15.199
it's too rough out,

41:15.200 --> 41:17.466
it's too rough out.

41:17.467 --> 41:19.467
- This is just getting ridiculous,
- brother.
