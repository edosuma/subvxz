Is Reinhardt acting as
an INDIVIDUAL or as a member
of a terrorist group?

00:07.471 --> 00:09.741
- I don't know that.
- Could you give us
the name of the victim?

00:09.808 --> 00:12.677
Katherine Mcallister.
She was in the bank.

00:12.744 --> 00:14.346
[ sighs ]

00:14.412 --> 00:18.516

00:18.583 --> 00:21.586
- I'm going to save you.
- I'd like to learn how to swim.

00:21.653 --> 00:24.589
- You can't swim?
- You don't--

00:24.656 --> 00:27.525
you moron!

00:27.592 --> 00:29.527
You know,
you're a joke, Ehrlich!

00:29.594 --> 00:32.097
Any idiot could have
gotten that signature!

00:32.162 --> 00:36.001
They said there was a bombing
three days ago, that my wife
Katherine was hurt.

00:36.067 --> 00:38.269
- She's in a coma.
- Why'd you do it?

00:38.336 --> 00:40.672
You wouldn't understand.

Reinhardt in 1122--
How long has
his light been on?

02:58.076 --> 03:00.345
Constantly.
Well, what are you
doing about it?

03:00.412 --> 03:02.981
He's been sitting up in Bed
smoking cigarettes all night.

03:03.048 --> 03:05.917
When was the last time
he was medicated?
10:50 P.M.

03:05.984 --> 03:09.354
I told him to keep his leg
Elevated. He's not gonna
listen, I got no tears.

03:09.421 --> 03:11.589
His way is,
"Give me demerol,
give me the morphine."

03:11.656 --> 03:15.660
"Demerol 75 milligrams,
vistaril 75 milligrams,
q4 hours, P.R.N. Pain."

03:15.727 --> 03:19.197
Every four hours, Skilling.
He's been due for over
half an hour.

03:19.264 --> 03:21.866
Do you think you can free
yourself to give him
his medication?

03:21.933 --> 03:25.704
I got 32 patients
to cover, Dr. Morrison,
and only two hands.

03:25.770 --> 03:28.173
Mr. Reinhardt blew up a bank
and two people died.

03:28.239 --> 03:30.775
<i>And the lady upstairs in I.C.U.
Is very critical.</i>

03:30.842 --> 03:35.580
- I'll get to him
when I get the chance.
- Give it to me.

03:35.647 --> 03:39.017
I didn't realize
you had such a soft spot
for terrorism.

03:39.084 --> 03:42.854
I don't care if you don't
like your job, skilling.
Just do it.

03:42.921 --> 03:46.491
I'll call you the next time
he rings for assistance,
Dr. Morrison.

This Press conference
has dragged on long enough.

I wanna go get somethin'

04:47.052 --> 04:50.622
Dr. Westphall, will Reinhardt
be in any condition
to stand trial?

04:50.689 --> 04:52.857
Well, as we stated
previously,

04:52.924 --> 04:56.194
Andrew Reinhardt sustained
multiple abrasions,

04:56.261 --> 05:00.298
a concussion, several
small facial Lacerations.

05:00.365 --> 05:05.170
He's in some pain, but, uh--
but he's in no present danger.

05:05.236 --> 05:08.340
<i>We consider his condition
to be satisfactory.</i>

05:08.406 --> 05:11.843
Is Reinhardt acting as
an INDIVIDUAL or as a member
of a terrorist group?

05:11.910 --> 05:14.479
I don't know.
You'd have to talk to
the police or the F.B.I.

05:14.546 --> 05:18.183
Was there a specific reason
Why he set off a bomb
in the bank?

05:18.249 --> 05:22.387
I'm sorry. I can't answer
any of these questions. I'm here
to give medical information.

05:22.454 --> 05:25.357
Could you give us the name
of the victim-- The woman
that you're treating?

05:25.423 --> 05:27.525
Yes. Her name is
Katherine Mcallister.

05:27.592 --> 05:30.362
She's 32 years old.
She's from minneapolis,
minnesota.

05:30.428 --> 05:33.531
- What's her status?
- Well, she's listed as serious.

05:33.598 --> 05:36.401
<i>Well, that's not exactly
correct, Donald.</i>

05:36.468 --> 05:39.971
We consider her condition
to be critical.

05:40.038 --> 05:42.641
She was technically dead
when she arrived here.

05:42.707 --> 05:45.510
Under the guidance
of Dr. Ben Samuels,

05:45.577 --> 05:50.215
our trauma team
initiated emergency
life-Support measures...

05:50.281 --> 05:52.751
which resulted
in reviving her vital signs.

05:52.817 --> 05:55.320
Dr. Samuels.

05:55.387 --> 05:59.124
Did you actually bring
Katherine Mcallister
back from the dead?

05:59.190 --> 06:03.128
Well, uh, in a clinical sense,
I suppose you can say
that's True, Yeah.

06:03.194 --> 06:05.563
Have you been involved
in Cases such
as this before?

06:05.630 --> 06:08.166
Yes, I have.
This, uh--

06:13.338 --> 06:15.707
Actually, uh, Dr. Craig...

06:15.774 --> 06:18.910
has had far more experience
with this sort of thing
than I have.

06:18.977 --> 06:21.546
Hundreds of times.

06:21.613 --> 06:24.983
As I was saying,
Katherine Mcallister
sustained abdominal wounds...

06:25.050 --> 06:27.352
with Intra-Abdominal
hemorrhage.

06:27.419 --> 06:29.921
How long did you
operate on her, Dr. Craig?

06:29.988 --> 06:33.525
In point of fact,
I was not the surgeon
of record.

06:33.591 --> 06:35.894
But as department chairman
of surgery,

06:35.960 --> 06:39.097
I was in constant communication
with the surgery team...

06:39.164 --> 06:42.233
<i>and served in
a supervisory capacity.</i>

06:42.300 --> 06:45.203
Now, that is not to say...

06:45.270 --> 06:48.640
that I was holding
the surgeons' hands.

06:48.707 --> 06:50.642
But my boys are the best.

06:50.709 --> 06:53.945
I'd put them up against
any big-Name team

We have our hand

07:08.760 --> 07:13.498
Now, we are aware
of the public perception
of our institution,

07:13.565 --> 07:18.737

by you gentlemen
as a second-Rate hospital.

07:26.878 --> 07:29.347
St. Eligius isn't elsewhere.

07:29.414 --> 07:31.483
This is the place to be.

Come on, Phil. The senior
residents can't back us up.
They don't have the time.

08:19.698 --> 08:23.034

operating on six people
in the last two nights.

some sleep to operate
on the next guy.

<i>They don't have the time.

08:28.039 --> 08:31.676
I had to borrow $60,000
to make it through
medical school.

08:31.743 --> 08:34.746
That means I'm gonna be

Good morning.
Dr. Armstrong,
how's Mr. Gorsky?

08:44.589 --> 08:47.892

with I.V. Antibiotics.

08:50.362 --> 08:53.431

As far as the infection
goes, fine,

08:53.498 --> 08:56.067
but he's getting
really abusive and he's
threatening to walk out.

08:56.134 --> 08:58.570

have been appropriate,

09:02.641 --> 09:06.011
why don't we just give him
the equivalent in P.O. Meds
and send him on his way.

No, she's homesick.

Well, I have some good news
and I have some bad.

Two of the major vessels to
your heart, the left anterior
descending artery...

10:45.477 --> 10:50.482
and the circumflex artery,
are 90% obstructed.
But I feel fine.

10:50.548 --> 10:54.519
You didn't feel fine when you
had those CHEST pains walking up
a flight of stairs, did you?

10:54.586 --> 10:58.189
Did I have a heart attack?
No, but when we put you
on the treadmill,

10:58.256 --> 11:01.359
your electrocardiogram
indicated ischemia.

11:01.426 --> 11:05.130

this look like to you?

11:13.638 --> 11:16.441
A rubber tube.
Arteries are tubes.

11:16.508 --> 11:20.578
They carry the blood
and oxygen from the heart.
Now, bear with me.

11:20.645 --> 11:24.749
If we obstruct the flow of blood
and oxygen to the brain,

11:24.816 --> 11:27.352

11:27.419 --> 11:30.488

If it isn't the stairs today,
it'll be washing
the car tomorrow,

your knee, or if you're lucky,
when you're sleeping.

a tube down your nose,

into your stomach,
and feed you that way.

going to starve.

we'll put main lines
right into your veins.

we'll put you in restraints,

incredibly satisfying,

- Exactly. Those fast-Food
hamburger joints.

17:38.957 --> 17:42.394
They fatten the cattle
with Estrogen. Hormones,
'cause it's more economical.

17:42.460 --> 17:46.798
It's all economics.
Life and death is economics.
And hamburgers.

17:46.865 --> 17:49.901
You couldn't afford to buy
a hamburger if they didn't
fatten the cattle with Estrogen.

17:49.968 --> 17:52.003
Where does it go?
It stays in the meat.

17:52.070 --> 17:54.939
It doesn't all get metabolized,
doesn't all get passed
through the cattles' urine.

17:55.006 --> 17:57.375
It's still in the meat,
and that, my fellow workers,

17:57.442 --> 18:01.579
is why we see these prepubescent

With developed breasts.

18:15.260 --> 18:17.195
I didn't want
to bother him.

18:17.262 --> 18:21.199
Since he's the best radiologist

It's not bribery, mother.

43:02.881 --> 43:05.283
<i>It's called tipping.</i>

43:05.350 --> 43:08.019
How much do you need, son?

43:08.086 --> 43:11.990
Well, the bigger the tip,
the better the service.

43:12.057 --> 43:13.958
A couple hundred.

43:16.294 --> 43:18.229
Here.

43:18.296 --> 43:21.366
We talked to that lawyer,
that Mr. Raveling.

43:21.433 --> 43:24.102
And he said that things
aren't as bad as they look.

43:24.169 --> 43:28.506
- No?
- No. He said there are
basically two ways to go.

43:28.573 --> 43:32.644
Since it's your first felony
charge, and you didn't intend
to hurt anyone--

43:32.711 --> 43:35.280
No one was supposed
to be in there
when the bomb went off.

43:35.347 --> 43:37.549
What's the second option?

43:38.817 --> 43:41.353
Well, it's, um,
temporary insanity.

43:41.419 --> 43:44.923
Mr. Raveling seems to think
he knows some psychiatrists
who will be sympathetic.

43:44.990 --> 43:48.860
<i>You tell that old bastard
we want to see
some results, right?</i>

43:48.927 --> 43:51.496
'Cause if he
can't do the job,
we'll get someone better.

43:51.563 --> 43:56.301
I know you can do it.
You're not gonna let those pigs
hang me out to dry, are you?

43:56.368 --> 44:00.071
Son, we're--
We'll do everything we can.
You know that.

44:01.439 --> 44:03.475
I know you will, Dad.

44:03.541 --> 44:05.677
You've never let me
down before.

44:09.781 --> 44:11.716
<i>[ Knocking ]</i>

44:11.783 --> 44:14.185
uh-huh?

44:14.252 --> 44:16.955
Dr. Westphall,
can we talk?

44:17.022 --> 44:19.424
I was just leaving.

44:19.491 --> 44:21.626
Okay. Sorry.

44:21.693 --> 44:23.628
Jack.

44:25.363 --> 44:28.633
My kids won't let me Tuck them
into bed anymore anyway.

44:29.768 --> 44:31.736
What's up?

44:34.005 --> 44:38.176
I saw Mr. Mcallister
outside his wife's room.

44:40.111 --> 44:43.782
Boy, what a shame.
Is she gonna be all right?

44:45.684 --> 44:49.821
Everybody keeps asking me
that, and I keep saying
the same thing-- I don't know.

44:49.888 --> 44:52.257
You know, it's ironic,
isn't it?

44:53.958 --> 44:56.895
Reinhardt sets off a bomb.

44:56.961 --> 44:58.930
Kills two people,

45:00.131 --> 45:02.367
maybe a third,

45:02.434 --> 45:04.536
and he's gonna be okay.

45:04.602 --> 45:08.707
And we do everything we can
to make sure he's gonna be okay.

45:08.773 --> 45:13.712
And the only thing he feels
for you or me or Mcallister
or his parents...

45:13.778 --> 45:16.348
or... anybody...

45:18.550 --> 45:21.052
is Contempt.

45:21.119 --> 45:23.955
This obnoxious,
withering sarcasm.

45:24.022 --> 45:28.326
<i>And we do everything
we can to make him okay.</i>

45:28.393 --> 45:30.428
We can't choose
our patients.

45:35.300 --> 45:38.870
When I got out of college,

45:38.937 --> 45:42.307
my folks wanted me
to go to law school,

45:42.374 --> 45:45.343
but my wife and I
had other plans.

45:45.410 --> 45:49.447
We bought a Van and
traveled around the country
for a year and a half.

45:49.514 --> 45:52.851
We said we wanted
to experience things,

45:52.917 --> 45:56.921
but the truth is
I just didn't want to go
to law school.

45:56.988 --> 45:59.724
And the reason I didn't want
to go was because I knew...

45:59.791 --> 46:01.926
I didn't want to defend
someone who's guilty.

46:01.993 --> 46:06.297
Now, I understand why lawyers
have to defend guilty people...

46:06.364 --> 46:09.467
and why doctors have to treat
terrible human beings.

46:09.534 --> 46:11.603
<i>But I've gotta
tell you something.</i>

46:11.670 --> 46:14.472
The reasons aren't
good enough.

46:14.539 --> 46:16.541
Because in order for me
to be a good doctor,

46:16.608 --> 46:20.045
I've gotta separate
my feelings from myself.

46:21.413 --> 46:25.050
And that scares
the hell out of me.

46:25.116 --> 46:29.220
Because if I don't know what
I feel, I don't know what I
believe in or who I am.

46:31.122 --> 46:34.592
You know, uh,
when I first
started my internship,

46:34.659 --> 46:37.996
I was a very
happily married man,

46:38.063 --> 46:40.632
but I fell in love
with one of my patients.

46:40.699 --> 46:43.335
She didn't know it.

46:43.401 --> 46:46.271
I don't think she knew it.
Maybe she did.
I don't know.

46:46.338 --> 46:48.406
But I'll tell you something.
I suffered.

46:48.473 --> 46:51.109
I used to carry
her x-Rays around with me.

46:51.176 --> 46:52.978
[ Laughing ]

46:53.044 --> 46:55.013
That's True.

46:57.148 --> 46:59.751
Oh, I don't know.
Sometimes, you know,

46:59.818 --> 47:01.753
doctors starting out
care too much.

47:01.820 --> 47:05.657
And then they get older,
they don't seem
to care enough and...

47:07.459 --> 47:11.529
they seem to become inured
to their own feelings
or to other people's pain.

47:11.596 --> 47:13.965
<i>It's a--</i>

a damn fine Lawyer.
