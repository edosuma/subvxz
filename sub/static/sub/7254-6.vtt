00:01.690 --> 00:03.519
Hello?
Gilmore residence.

00:03.529 --> 00:04.980
Hey, mom, it's me.

00:04.990 --> 00:06.362
I just wanted to
leave you a message

00:06.392 --> 00:09.255
letting you know that unfortunately,
I will not be able to come by tonight

00:09.285 --> 00:11.008
to take a look at
your new curtains.

00:11.018 --> 00:12.381
Lorelai, it's me.

00:12.391 --> 00:15.198
- So, sorry I missed you, but --
- You didn't miss me.

00:15.208 --> 00:16.651
For heaven's sakes,
I'm right here.

00:16.661 --> 00:18.106
- Hello?
- Hello? Lorelai?

00:18.115 --> 00:19.410
- Hello?
- Hello?

00:19.423 --> 00:21.121
Huh. That's weird.

00:21.137 --> 00:23.153
I don't know if your
machine just cut me off.

00:23.169 --> 00:24.622
Is something wrong
with this phone?

00:24.639 --> 00:26.511
Anyway, uh, something came up,

00:26.528 --> 00:29.303
and I just have to take a rain
check on the curtain check.

00:29.318 --> 00:30.913
I'm sure they're beautiful.

00:30.926 --> 00:32.823
No one knows how to pick
out curtains like you.

00:32.835 --> 00:33.921
You're the curtain queen.

00:33.936 --> 00:36.010
Hello? Lorelai,
can you hear me?

00:36.027 --> 00:38.211
Anyway, have a good night,
curtain queen.

00:38.226 --> 00:40.033
Give my best to dad. Bye.

00:40.045 --> 00:42.730
Lorelai? Hello? Hello?

00:43.058 --> 00:44.831
See? I told you it would work.

00:44.847 --> 00:46.740
Wow. How did you
even think to --

00:46.757 --> 00:49.841
Well, it's natural instincts
honed by years of experience.

00:49.858 --> 00:50.763
Wow.

00:50.778 --> 00:52.781
Yeah. Fight or flight, you know.
Fight or flight.

00:52.798 --> 00:53.901
And I just did my nails, so...

00:53.935 --> 00:55.471
- Flight.
- Flight.

00:55.867 --> 00:57.262
Wow.

00:59.000 --> 01:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:56.785 --> 02:00.151
Où est la station de
métro la plus proche ?

02:00.355 --> 02:03.201
"Where is the nearest
subway station?"

02:03.216 --> 02:04.323
Yeah.

02:04.577 --> 02:07.493
Ou est-ce que je peux
acheter un billet ?

02:07.507 --> 02:11.233
- "Where can I buy a ticket?"
- The hunter and gatherer has returned.

02:11.247 --> 02:13.253
Hey. Listen to how
good I've gotten.

02:13.265 --> 02:16.450
Pouvez-vous me donner un plan de métro,
s'il vous plaît ?

02:16.466 --> 02:19.581
"Could I have a map of
the subway, please?"

02:19.858 --> 02:23.302
Could I have a map of
the subway, please?

02:23.317 --> 02:24.540
- Impressive.
- Right?

02:24.557 --> 02:26.350
I'm practically fluent.

02:26.365 --> 02:28.802
Thank you for the
coffee and croissant.

02:28.818 --> 02:30.330
De rien.

02:30.348 --> 02:31.833
"You're welcome."

02:31.845 --> 02:33.350
Duh.

02:33.978 --> 02:36.111
I thought our stomachs should
start adjusting to french cuisine,

02:36.146 --> 02:38.643
so I got croissants
and café au lait.

02:38.655 --> 02:40.122
I thought café au
lait was spanish.

02:40.138 --> 02:42.581
No, it's french for "coffee
and milk." "Lait" is "milk."

02:42.597 --> 02:47.773
Really? I thought it was "café
olé," like, "coffee! All right!"

02:47.787 --> 02:49.290
You're kidding.

02:49.306 --> 02:51.671
You're not kidding.
You are. You're kidding.

02:51.687 --> 02:52.823
I can't tell whether
you're kidding.

02:52.858 --> 02:54.293
I'm a woman of mystery.

02:54.306 --> 02:56.392
You know, you might want to try
repeating some of those words in french.

02:56.425 --> 02:57.122
No.

02:57.138 --> 02:58.583
We leave for Paris
in two weeks.

02:58.597 --> 03:00.322
Yes, but I don't have to
actually speak french.

03:00.357 --> 03:01.771
I just have to sound french.

03:01.787 --> 03:04.553
That way, if the parisians find
me just another uncouth american,

03:04.566 --> 03:06.401
I can tell them my sad story.

03:06.417 --> 03:08.590
"I was born in Marseille,

03:08.608 --> 03:12.811
"and my parents were killed
in a très tragique accident.

03:12.825 --> 03:15.522
"And so I was sent
to the states

03:15.536 --> 03:17.940
"and adopted by
the evil Gilmores,

03:17.957 --> 03:20.452
"who refused to let
me speak french,

03:20.468 --> 03:24.780
"but I never forgot the
accent of my mother country."

03:24.798 --> 03:26.443
That's a complicated backstory.

03:26.458 --> 03:28.400
I've led a complicated life.

03:28.617 --> 03:31.113
- Somebody gets a lot of mail.
- Yeah, well, I'm a popular gal.

03:31.125 --> 03:34.111
Also, my system is,
I only open my mail once a month.

03:34.128 --> 03:36.912
Your system is to open
your mail once a month?

03:36.925 --> 03:38.190
12 times a year, you know,

03:38.208 --> 03:40.502
because if you open your
mail more than that,

03:40.518 --> 03:43.652
you get a lot of mattress fliers
and bills and another bill.

03:43.667 --> 03:45.801
This way,
I open it once a month,

03:45.818 --> 03:48.093
and I get letters from people
who still write letters

03:48.105 --> 03:51.210
and shampoo samples
and fun stuff.

03:51.225 --> 03:52.882
It's  fun.

03:53.215 --> 03:54.441
Hey, what's this?

03:54.455 --> 03:56.190
Something from Yale?

03:56.207 --> 03:58.092
About the parents' weekend.
We should go.

03:58.107 --> 03:59.611
- Nah.
- Why no?

03:59.626 --> 04:00.803
I'm sure it already happened.

04:00.818 --> 04:03.023
No, it's happening this weekend.
Come on. Could be fun.

04:03.037 --> 04:04.973
I got to wash my hair.

04:04.987 --> 04:06.393
Why don't you want to go?

04:06.408 --> 04:07.523
Because -- my hair.

04:07.537 --> 04:10.401
Looks great when it's dirty. The oil
gives it a kinf of sheen and gloss.

04:10.437 --> 04:12.612
Parents' weekend is for lame-o
parents whose kids hate them,

04:12.645 --> 04:15.732
so they need a school-sanctioned
event so they all spend time together.

04:15.748 --> 04:18.762
A professor of geology is giving
a tour of the Peabody Museum.

04:18.776 --> 04:20.161
My kid likes me.

04:20.175 --> 04:22.132
I can go to Yale
any time I want.

04:22.146 --> 04:24.803
51 weekends of the year
is my parents' weekend.

04:24.817 --> 04:27.971
"The gemstones of Yale."
How cool does that sound?

04:27.987 --> 04:29.592
On a scale of 1 to 2?

04:29.607 --> 04:33.282
Listen, parents' weekend is not an
accurate portrait of the school, anyway.

04:33.297 --> 04:36.063
They make special food.
They gussy the place up.

04:36.077 --> 04:38.902
They plant kids under
trees reading Tolstoy,

04:38.917 --> 04:41.130
so it all looks very
collegiate and idyllic.

04:41.148 --> 04:43.373
There's a brunch at
Branford with the provost.

04:43.386 --> 04:44.972
You know,
I've always loved the word "provost."

04:45.007 --> 04:46.982
Although I have no idea
who or what a provost is,

04:46.997 --> 04:48.722
- it just sounds so...
- Idyllic and collegiate?

04:48.758 --> 04:50.582
Yes, or something
from a deli counter.

04:50.597 --> 04:52.332
"Extra provost on
that, please."

04:52.346 --> 04:53.500
Do you really want to go?

04:53.515 --> 04:55.222
It's parents' weekend,
we're Rory's parents,

04:55.256 --> 04:57.632
and we're together,
and why not?

04:57.648 --> 05:00.082
Come on, I'll help you shampoo
your hair the night before.

05:00.097 --> 05:01.093
All right.

05:01.105 --> 05:03.353
But I have to work on sunday,
so we'll have to go saturday,

05:03.387 --> 05:05.790
and you'll have to give
me a nice head massage

05:05.805 --> 05:08.072
- when you wash my hair.
- With shampoo samples.

05:08.085 --> 05:09.213
- And blow it out.
- Done.

05:09.227 --> 05:11.012
- And braid it.
- I'll french-braid it.

05:11.026 --> 05:12.692
Ooh là là. Hello?

05:12.706 --> 05:14.490
- Mom?
- Bonjour, Rory.

05:14.508 --> 05:16.702
Well, if it isn't the
orphan from Marseille.

05:16.718 --> 05:18.460
C'est moi. What are you doing?

05:18.478 --> 05:20.040
- Heading to class.
- Class?

05:20.055 --> 05:22.410
Yes, class, where they teach
you all the college learnin'.

05:22.427 --> 05:25.540
You're a senior. I thought no
seniors went to class before noon.

05:25.558 --> 05:27.022
Nerd alert! Nerd alert!

05:27.037 --> 05:28.570
Says the woman
saying "nerd alert!"

05:28.586 --> 05:30.511
Hey,  guess who's coming
to parents' weekend.

05:30.528 --> 05:32.170
Bunch of lame parents
whose kids hate 'em.

05:32.208 --> 05:34.362
- Yes, and your parents.
- No way!

05:34.376 --> 05:37.123
I got to keep you on your toes.
When you think I'll zig, I'll zag.

05:37.135 --> 05:39.493
Then,  when you think I'm gonna zag,
I do zag,

05:39.506 --> 05:41.760
just to mess you up for the next time,
when might zig.

05:41.777 --> 05:42.892
Dad's making you zag?

05:42.906 --> 05:44.492
He's dying to meet the provost.

05:44.506 --> 05:45.881
Well, who isn't?

05:45.898 --> 05:47.912
It's your mom who's
all about the provost.

05:47.926 --> 05:50.043
I just wanted to see you and,
you know, check it out.

05:50.055 --> 05:51.722
And I wouldn't mind seeing
the gemstones of Yale.

05:51.757 --> 05:54.160
- The huh?
- The gemstones. The Yale gemstones.

05:54.176 --> 05:54.933
Oh, right.

05:54.946 --> 05:56.663
So is it cool if we come?
It's only for saturday.

05:56.695 --> 05:59.383
Yeah, it'd be great. I mean,
saturday's gonna be pretty busy for me

05:59.398 --> 06:01.840
'cause we have to put out a parents'
weekend edition of the paper,

06:01.873 --> 06:03.161
but I could
definitely do lunch.

06:03.177 --> 06:04.823
- She can do lunch.
- All right, then we'll do lunch.

06:04.859 --> 06:06.722
I'll have extra
provost with mine.

06:06.739 --> 06:08.870
Hey, after lunch,
can we walk Hunky Dan?

06:08.886 --> 06:09.870
You mean, Handsome Dan?

06:09.888 --> 06:11.561
That's his official
mascot name.

06:11.578 --> 06:13.561
"Hunky Dan" is what I call
him when we're alone.

06:13.576 --> 06:14.582
Mom, I got to go.

06:14.597 --> 06:16.363
You know who'd make a great mascot?
Paul Anka.

06:16.397 --> 06:17.093
Mom--

06:17.106 --> 06:19.210
I'm not sure he's the Ivy League type,
though. He might need more

06:19.246 --> 06:22.123
of a hacky-sacking, poetry-reading,
tie-dyeing kind of place --

06:22.138 --> 06:24.121
- Mom!
- Like Reed or Oberlin,

06:24.136 --> 06:26.482
where the air is sweet with
the scent of patchouli.

06:26.498 --> 06:28.760
Mom, I'm not missing the
beginning of this lecture.

06:28.778 --> 06:31.152
Nerd alert!
Nerd alert! Nerd alert!

06:32.405 --> 06:34.680
- What kind of sandwich is that, Luke?
- Ham and cheese.

06:34.698 --> 06:36.303
- Is it stinky cheese?
- Cheddar.

06:36.315 --> 06:39.030
Because you really don't want to pack
April a lunch with stinky cheese.

06:39.068 --> 06:40.532
By lunchtime,
the whole bag will smell,

06:40.567 --> 06:43.363
and people won't believe it when
she says it's just the cheese.

06:43.376 --> 06:45.133
They'll think it's her.
They'll think she's stinky.

06:45.168 --> 06:46.243
Eat your breakfast, Kirk.

06:46.256 --> 06:47.752
- Muffin?
- Yes, muffin?

06:47.765 --> 06:49.113
No, I'm offering.

06:49.128 --> 06:51.003
- Is it bran?
- It's banana.

06:51.018 --> 06:52.452
It could be banana-bran.

06:52.465 --> 06:54.293
- It's just banana.
- Okay.

06:54.308 --> 06:55.872
- Butter?
- Not too much.

06:55.888 --> 06:58.151
- 1 1/2 pats.
- Two pats is too much.

06:58.177 --> 07:00.183
- 1 1/2.
- April, your ride's here.

07:00.198 --> 07:01.752
I'm coming!

07:02.865 --> 07:04.213
- Got everything?
- Yeah.

07:04.225 --> 07:05.273
- Protractor?
- I got it.

07:05.286 --> 07:06.470
- Biology homework?
- Yep.

07:06.487 --> 07:08.653
- Extra sweater?
- Green cardigan in my locker.

07:08.667 --> 07:10.142
- Good, good.
- Bye, dad.

07:10.158 --> 07:12.111
- Wait, what about your swimsuit?
- I got it.

07:12.125 --> 07:13.750
You sure you don't need
a ride to swim practice?

07:13.785 --> 07:15.801
Megan's mom is taking me.
I told you.

07:15.815 --> 07:17.683
She's coming!
All right, so, look --

07:17.697 --> 07:20.402
I'll pick you up at 5:00,
and I'll be there right after work.

07:20.415 --> 07:21.751
- Okay.
- Okay. All right.

07:21.767 --> 07:23.812
All right, already!
She's standing right here! Go!

07:23.826 --> 07:25.220
All right. Bye.

07:26.355 --> 07:27.990
I should go, too.

07:28.006 --> 07:29.522
Have a good day, baby.

07:29.536 --> 07:30.542
You too.

07:30.555 --> 07:32.683
- Bye, Luke.
- Bye, Lulu.

07:37.575 --> 07:40.681
Could someone crack a window?
Because I am suffocating.

07:40.697 --> 07:42.513
- What?
- Tell me you didn't see that.

07:42.526 --> 07:43.613
See what, Kirk?

07:43.628 --> 07:45.410
Lulu! She's smothering me!

07:45.428 --> 07:46.641
Smothering you?

07:46.655 --> 07:48.402
Everywhere I go, there she is.

07:48.415 --> 07:51.253
I'm sitting at the movies.
Who's sitting next to me? Lulu.

07:51.266 --> 07:54.230
I go out to dinner.
Who's sitting across from me? Lulu.

07:54.245 --> 07:56.293
I'm hanging out on the couch,
watching TV.

07:56.306 --> 07:57.743
Who's right there next to me?

07:57.758 --> 07:59.520
- Your mother.
- And Lulu.

07:59.538 --> 08:01.952
And at least mother
respects my personal space.

08:01.968 --> 08:04.331
Sometimes when you're
watching "Antiques Roadshow,"

08:04.347 --> 08:07.552
you just don't want
somebody tickling your arm.

08:13.265 --> 08:14.850
Bye again.

08:20.935 --> 08:22.493
You're  pitiful.

08:22.508 --> 08:23.863
I'm just telling you how it is.

08:23.878 --> 08:26.383
You don't tell me how it is.
I tell you how it is.

08:26.395 --> 08:28.081
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

08:28.095 --> 08:30.593
You think you do, but you don't.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

08:30.628 --> 08:32.812
You're telling me that
you tell me how it is?

08:32.826 --> 08:34.022
That's what I'm telling you.

08:34.035 --> 08:36.043
- We'll just see about that. Lorelai?
- Busy.

08:36.056 --> 08:38.070
- We have a question.
- Busy, busy bee.

08:38.086 --> 08:40.153
Sookie's under the mistaken
impression that she will be

08:40.188 --> 08:42.832
in charge of the front desk
while you are in Paris.

08:42.847 --> 08:45.222
I informed her that
that job falls to me.

08:45.236 --> 08:47.132
Could you please
clear this up for her?

08:47.146 --> 08:50.310
Did I not mention how busy I am?
Busy, like a bee. Bzzz!

08:50.327 --> 08:51.643
Lorelai!

08:51.728 --> 08:55.232
Michel, while I am away,
you're in charge of the front desk.

08:55.246 --> 08:57.581
However, Sookie is a
co-owner of the Inn,

08:57.595 --> 09:00.000
so she is in charge in charge.

09:00.355 --> 09:03.010
That is preposterous.
She does not know the first thing

09:03.028 --> 09:04.892
about running the front desk.

09:04.908 --> 09:07.300
All I have to know is how
to tell your sorry behind

09:07.317 --> 09:09.421
to stand at the front
desk and be courteous

09:09.437 --> 09:12.083
and to check those nice
people in and out.

09:12.095 --> 09:14.573
- Sorry.
- Absurd.

09:14.585 --> 09:16.850
That's right --
back to your station!

09:17.065 --> 09:18.781
Really? Was that
really necessary?

09:18.798 --> 09:20.032
- What?
- To provoke him like that.

09:20.067 --> 09:21.452
You know how sensitive he is.

09:21.468 --> 09:23.530
Well, I'm sorry.
He's been driving me crazy.

09:23.547 --> 09:25.553
He keeps referring to
himself as my supervisor

09:25.566 --> 09:27.400
and insisting that I
call him "captain."

09:27.418 --> 09:30.192
Well now I have to deal all
day with sulky, pouty Michel.

09:30.208 --> 09:31.380
He's a big baby.

09:31.395 --> 09:33.672
He should come to work wearing
a diaper and carrying a rattle.

09:33.705 --> 09:36.191
Maybe while I'm gone,
you can get him to do that.

09:37.358 --> 09:38.773
Hello?

09:38.785 --> 09:39.851
Oh, hi.

09:39.868 --> 09:41.610
- Are you Sookie St. James?
- That's me.

09:41.625 --> 09:43.953
I'm Harvey Tuttle.
I just took over the Tillman farm.

09:43.967 --> 09:46.850
Oh, yeah. Congratulations.
Beautiful property.

09:46.868 --> 09:49.320
Thank you. I still can't
quite believe it's all mine.

09:49.337 --> 09:50.863
Anyhow, this is my first crop,

09:50.875 --> 09:53.542
and I'm offering free samples
to all the local restaurants.

09:53.558 --> 09:57.171
Got some eggplant, some zucchini,
some tomatoes here.

09:57.186 --> 10:00.002
Oh, thank you, but I already 
have a vegetable supplier.

10:00.017 --> 10:02.272
Well, you know, technically,
tomatoes are a fruit.

10:02.285 --> 10:03.701
Ah. Fair point.

10:03.716 --> 10:05.912
Well, I have a vegetable
and fruit supplier.

10:05.926 --> 10:07.640
- How about legumes?
- And legumes.

10:07.656 --> 10:10.020
That's okay. Why don't you go
ahead and take this batch anyway?

10:10.056 --> 10:11.882
- Oh, no, no, no.
- On the house.

10:11.895 --> 10:14.160
If you like it and feel like
passing my name along to someone,

10:14.195 --> 10:15.743
I'd greatly appreciate it.

10:15.757 --> 10:18.401
- Okay. I will do that.
- Thank you.

10:18.415 --> 10:19.642
It was nice meeting
you, Sookie.

10:19.677 --> 10:21.590
Nice to meet you, too.

10:25.397 --> 10:27.703
Come on! Everybody should be 
in the locker room!

10:27.716 --> 10:29.702
Allison, Haley, no running.

10:29.715 --> 10:31.350
My towel's all wet.

10:31.365 --> 10:33.341
That's what happens when you
throw it in the pool, Laura.

10:33.377 --> 10:35.013
It's a terrific lesson
in cause and effect.

10:35.045 --> 10:37.863
Now, squeeze it out
and go get changed.

10:39.428 --> 10:40.760
Thank you.

10:42.098 --> 10:45.001
- Hi, there.
- Hi. I'm Luke Danes.

10:45.016 --> 10:46.872
April's dad.
She talks a lot about you.

10:46.888 --> 10:48.302
Yeah,  you must be
coach Bennett.

10:48.317 --> 10:49.250
- Susan.
- Yeah.

10:49.266 --> 10:50.812
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah. You too.

10:50.825 --> 10:52.611
April's in the locker room.
She should be right out.

10:52.646 --> 10:53.450
Okay.

10:53.466 --> 10:54.811
She's doing really great --

10:54.825 --> 10:56.950
definitely one of our most
enthusiastic swimmers.

10:56.968 --> 10:58.493
Yeah, she really
seems to love it.

10:58.506 --> 11:00.521
Good natural technique, too.
Does she get that from you?

11:00.557 --> 11:03.391
Oh, no, not me.
No, I don't really know how to swim.

11:03.406 --> 11:04.892
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

11:04.906 --> 11:06.920
I mean, I could doggy-paddle
to shore in a pinch,

11:06.935 --> 11:09.143
but I never really 
learned formally, you know.

11:09.158 --> 11:10.430
Luke, that's not good.

11:10.445 --> 11:11.672
I'm pretty good
on land, though.

11:11.706 --> 11:13.101
You need to be certified.

11:13.118 --> 11:15.702
You take April to pools,
lakes, the ocean.

11:15.717 --> 11:17.633
I never really
thought about that.

11:17.647 --> 11:20.950
No worries. I teach an adult swim class
saturday mornings for 1 1/2 hour.

11:20.967 --> 11:24.213
It's an 8-week course. And in fact,
I started new classes last week,

11:24.238 --> 11:27.340
so if you came this saturday, you'll
really not have missed much at all.

11:27.357 --> 11:29.173
Oh, I-I don't know.

11:29.186 --> 11:31.462
Luke, this is not
something I would wait on.

11:31.476 --> 11:34.571
Well, I -- Yeah, okay.
I guess I could do that.

11:34.586 --> 11:35.532
Great.

11:35.547 --> 11:37.672
- Hey, dad.
- Hey.

11:37.686 --> 11:39.053
Oh, this is coach Bennett.

11:39.066 --> 11:40.103
Yeah, we were just meeting.

11:40.137 --> 11:42.193
Well, did she tell you I'm gonna
swim the 100-meter butterfly

11:42.228 --> 11:44.980
and the 4x100-meter freestyle
at our meet next week?

11:44.997 --> 11:46.350
No, but that's great!

11:46.367 --> 11:48.572
I mean, I'm not anchor or anything,
but I'm still pretty fast.

11:48.606 --> 11:50.201
And getting faster
all the time.

11:50.218 --> 11:53.221
And hey, your dad's gonna
take a swim class with me.

11:53.318 --> 11:55.140
Really? You are?

11:55.155 --> 11:56.110
Well, yeah.

11:56.127 --> 11:57.791
Do you even own a bathing suit?

11:57.807 --> 12:01.881
Yeah, I do.
I mean, it's not a Speedo or anything.

12:03.618 --> 12:06.491
That is the funniest
thing I have ever --

12:06.508 --> 12:08.701
can we call mom and
tell her from the car?

12:08.717 --> 12:10.322
Yeah.

12:12.257 --> 12:15.542
Grass is just not this green -- not
outside of "Pleasantville," it isn't.

12:15.556 --> 12:16.961
So, what exactly
are you saying?

12:16.975 --> 12:19.311
I'm suggesting they
brought in sod.

12:19.328 --> 12:22.000
- You suspect sod.
- Yes, yes, or spray paint.

12:22.017 --> 12:24.472
Maybe they spray-painted the grass
when they spray-painted these trees

12:24.505 --> 12:28.023
'cause there's autumnal foliage
and then there's autumnal foliage.

12:28.036 --> 12:29.512
It's over the top, people.

12:29.528 --> 12:33.022
You're onto them. Hey, you think
Yale piped in this crisp fall smell?

12:33.038 --> 12:36.560
Uh, yeah, because Yale is crafty,
Yale is smart.

12:36.577 --> 12:38.182
Yale is Yale, after all.

12:38.195 --> 12:40.702
Have fun, you two!
Go, Bulldogs!

12:40.715 --> 12:41.591
Hello.

12:41.606 --> 12:42.622
Hi!

12:42.636 --> 12:43.880
Let me ask you something.

12:43.896 --> 12:47.570
Do you really go here,
or are you an actress hired by Yale?

12:47.585 --> 12:50.273
What? I go here. I go here.

12:50.288 --> 12:51.672
You're good.
I almost believe you.

12:51.687 --> 12:52.501
I'm sorry?

12:52.515 --> 12:54.651
Hi. We're Rory
Gilmore's parents.

12:54.667 --> 12:58.781
Well, Rory Gilmore's parents,
welcome to parents' weekend.

12:58.795 --> 13:01.060
- Here's a parents' packet.
- Fabulous.

13:01.077 --> 13:04.033
Inside, you should find a map
of the campus. You are here.

13:04.047 --> 13:04.841
So we are.

13:04.857 --> 13:07.503
A schedule of the weekend's
events and a nametag.

13:07.515 --> 13:09.340
Thanks. Great.
Go, Bulldogs.

13:09.356 --> 13:11.763
I was just gonna say that.
Have fun, you two.

13:11.775 --> 13:12.912
- Okay.
- Thank you.

13:12.928 --> 13:14.800
Hey, let's be
Laverne and Shirley.

13:14.818 --> 13:15.733
What? No.

13:15.748 --> 13:17.691
Antony and Cleopatra?
F. Scott and Zelda?

13:17.707 --> 13:18.932
Zinf and Del?

13:18.945 --> 13:21.290
I think I'll stick
with my own name.

13:21.305 --> 13:24.230
Pbht! Señor boring pants?
Mr. Stick-in-the-mud?

13:24.247 --> 13:27.031
"A cappella," "a
cappella." Hmm-hmm.

13:27.048 --> 13:29.242
There's a terrifying number of
a-cappella jams this weekend.

13:29.275 --> 13:31.261
What exactly is an
a-cappella jam?

13:31.278 --> 13:34.050
I don't know,
but it sure sounds painful.

13:34.247 --> 13:35.393
Hey. We're here.

13:35.405 --> 13:38.392
Hey. See if you can get that
editorial to fit on one page.

13:38.407 --> 13:39.361
So, you're here.

13:39.378 --> 13:41.061
With bells on,
and nothing else,

13:41.078 --> 13:44.180
except leg warmers, roller skates,
and Groucho Marx glasses.

13:44.196 --> 13:46.022
- How classy.
- Hi, Rory!

13:46.038 --> 13:48.302
Well, we're your parents.
We're supposed to embarrass you.

13:48.337 --> 13:49.411
Are you at the paper?

13:49.425 --> 13:51.391
Yes, I am, indeed.
Where are you guys?

13:51.407 --> 13:54.781
We are near a big brick
building and a big tree.

13:54.796 --> 13:56.293
- Are you near there?
- Possibly.

13:56.308 --> 13:58.623
We have a lot of brick buildings
and old trees here at Yale.

13:58.657 --> 14:00.901
Tell her we're by the L-shaped
building that from the top

14:00.938 --> 14:02.471
looks like a polaroid camera.

14:02.485 --> 14:04.641
Believe it or not,
I don't know what Yale's buildings

14:04.658 --> 14:05.712
look like from the sky.

14:05.726 --> 14:07.230
How ignorant of you, honey.

14:07.248 --> 14:10.063
Rory says she doesn't give two
figs about Yale architecture.

14:10.075 --> 14:11.580
Not two figs?

14:11.597 --> 14:13.021
1 1/2 figs is all I'll give.

14:13.037 --> 14:14.173
So how are things at the paper?

14:14.207 --> 14:16.473
Busy but good.
I should be done by lunch.

14:16.486 --> 14:19.130
We got this schedule of events.
Any recommendations?

14:19.148 --> 14:20.383
Brunch with the provost!

14:20.396 --> 14:21.681
I might like to
tour the Peabody

14:21.698 --> 14:23.781
or maybe catch one of
the faculty lectures --

14:23.796 --> 14:26.282
There's one called "Plagues and
pleasures" with professor Summers.

14:26.317 --> 14:29.361
Summers is good. He's a bigwig in
the world of molecular biophysics.

14:29.375 --> 14:30.263
Sounds hard.

14:30.277 --> 14:31.573
I doubt there'll be an exam.

14:31.588 --> 14:34.662
How about "the extravagant
universe" with professor Quincy?

14:34.677 --> 14:37.101
Hey, what is with
all the a cappella?

14:37.115 --> 14:39.482
There's a cappella, a cappella,
morning, noon, and night.

14:39.498 --> 14:41.190
I'm not sure I can take
that much a cappella.

14:41.228 --> 14:44.361
Then you should avoid arches. A-cappella
groups tend to hang out under arches.

14:44.375 --> 14:46.580
Arches and any other places
with good acoustics.

14:46.597 --> 14:47.551
Thanks for the tip.

14:47.567 --> 14:49.883
If you hear a pitch pipe, run.
I got to get back to work.

14:49.897 --> 14:51.911
Okay, we're gonna have
brunch with the provost...

14:51.926 --> 14:54.020
or on the provost --
it's still unclear.

14:54.038 --> 14:55.983
- Bye, mom.
- Bye.

14:56.168 --> 14:57.222
H ey.

14:57.236 --> 14:58.960
What is with your nametag?

14:58.976 --> 14:59.742
What do you mean?

14:59.757 --> 15:01.121
It's in the middle
of your chest.

15:01.137 --> 15:01.811
So?

15:01.825 --> 15:03.881
So, you're supposed to
wear it off to the side.

15:03.895 --> 15:05.342
Who wears a nametag in
the middle of their chest?

15:05.376 --> 15:06.770
- Superman.
- Superman's "S"?

15:06.787 --> 15:08.202
That was not a nametag.
That was an emblem.

15:08.236 --> 15:09.731
So, this is my emblem.

15:09.748 --> 15:12.570
"Hello, I'm Rory Gilmore's dad,
Christopher" is your emblem?

15:12.585 --> 15:14.183
Yes.
Yes, it is.

15:14.195 --> 15:16.790
I'm gonna have to ask you to
walk 15 feet in front of me.

15:17.715 --> 15:21.532
And breathe in. And blow.

15:22.055 --> 15:26.511
And breathe in. And blow.

15:26.795 --> 15:28.130
Good, Luke.

15:28.148 --> 15:29.891
But try not to take
such shallow breaths.

15:29.907 --> 15:33.401
Try to take slower,
deeper breaths from your diaphragm.

15:33.416 --> 15:35.411
- Feel that?
- Yeah.

15:35.428 --> 15:38.212
I'm having a little trouble
getting deep breaths over here.

15:38.225 --> 15:40.071
You're doing fine, Ronald.

15:40.088 --> 15:42.793
Now you stopped
breathing altogether.

15:42.806 --> 15:45.143
- Just try and relax.
- Okay.

15:45.305 --> 15:48.062
It's okay.
You'll get the hang of it.

15:48.076 --> 15:50.890
All right, everybody.
That's it. Good work.

15:51.518 --> 15:52.783
You did good today.

15:52.797 --> 15:54.182
- Yeah? Thanks.
- Yeah.

15:54.198 --> 15:55.930
You caught right up.

15:56.026 --> 15:58.001
I'll have you swimming
like a fish in no time.

15:58.017 --> 15:59.252
Oh, good. Thank you.

15:59.268 --> 16:01.362
So... you eat?

16:01.376 --> 16:02.892
- Eat?
- Food.

16:02.905 --> 16:05.312
I was thinking you could call me,
and we could get a bite to eat.

16:05.347 --> 16:07.151
Uh, yeah, sure, sure.

16:07.168 --> 16:09.642
Here. Here's the Young
Dolphins' contact sheet.

16:09.657 --> 16:11.111
My number's right at the top.

16:11.125 --> 16:13.323
Okay. Great. Thanks.

16:13.577 --> 16:15.223
- See you soon.
- Bye.

16:16.298 --> 16:18.130
Look at this propaganda.

16:18.146 --> 16:20.260
Belgian waffles, cloth napkins.

16:20.276 --> 16:21.662
I've had breakfast here before,

16:21.677 --> 16:24.592
and it was paper napkins and
american cereal all the way.

16:24.608 --> 16:26.990
Yeah --
lox, capers, itty-bitty bagels?

16:27.005 --> 16:28.333
Pack of lies.

16:28.348 --> 16:29.172
Coffee?

16:29.188 --> 16:30.761
Uh, coffee.

16:30.778 --> 16:31.653
Coffee.

16:31.668 --> 16:33.131
I'm Lou, Ethan Morton's dad.

16:33.147 --> 16:33.901
Cheers.

16:33.917 --> 16:36.763
I'm Christopher. This is Lorelai.
We're Rory Gilmore's parents.

16:36.776 --> 16:39.223
Rory Gilmore? Sure.
She's a senior, right?

16:39.235 --> 16:41.833
Wow. Did you memorize
the student facebook?

16:41.847 --> 16:43.713
The masthead of the
Yale Daily News.

16:43.728 --> 16:46.990
Ethan's an aspiring journalist
and a big fan of your daughter's.

16:47.006 --> 16:48.840
I love that Rory has fans.

16:48.856 --> 16:51.661
Maybe we should set up a lunch or
something so Rory could meet Ethan.

16:51.675 --> 16:53.491
Lou, honestly.

16:53.507 --> 16:55.361
I apologize on behalf
of my husband,

16:55.378 --> 16:58.312
who can't seem to remember that
Ethan already got into Yale.

16:58.328 --> 17:01.283
The pressure's off. He doesn't
need his booster club anymore.

17:01.295 --> 17:02.101
Daisy.

17:02.116 --> 17:04.819
Hi. Lorelai and Christopher.
We're Rory Gilmore's parents.

17:04.836 --> 17:07.512
Oh, Rory Gilmore's parents.

17:07.527 --> 17:09.473
Oh! Where did you get the
darling little bagels?

17:09.487 --> 17:11.221
Oh, they're right over here.
I'll show you.

17:11.238 --> 17:14.303
You know, Ethan really is an
incredible journalist.

17:14.318 --> 17:16.540
He wrote this editorial
for his high-school paper

17:16.557 --> 17:19.363
arguing that it should be legal
to burn the american flag.

17:19.377 --> 17:20.611
Insightful as hell.

17:20.627 --> 17:22.612
I'd be glad to e-mail you a copy,
if you want.

17:22.626 --> 17:23.953
Where is the provost?

17:23.965 --> 17:25.711
Aren't you dying to
meet the provost?

17:25.724 --> 17:27.073
Sorry if I was
being a bit pushy.

17:27.088 --> 17:28.800
No. Please. You're a proud dad.

17:28.818 --> 17:30.650
Yeah. And we should
be proud, right?

17:30.665 --> 17:32.820
- Our kids done good.
- Yeah.

17:32.837 --> 17:35.551
It's just hard to let go,
you know, after all those years

17:35.568 --> 17:37.981
of looking over their homework
and reading their papers,

17:37.998 --> 17:40.160
practicing lines with
them for the school play,

17:40.176 --> 17:42.932
taking them to karate lessons,
violin lessons,

17:42.945 --> 17:44.592
S.A.T.-prep courses.

17:44.607 --> 17:46.321
What about 5:00 a.m.
hockey practice?

17:46.335 --> 17:47.683
Science projects.

17:47.695 --> 17:50.163
I helped Owen build a
wave generator one year.

17:50.175 --> 17:51.343
$3,200.

17:51.356 --> 17:53.111
That's what it cost me to
replace the kitchen tiles

17:53.146 --> 17:55.230
when the thing exploded in
the middle of the night.

17:55.245 --> 17:57.593
- It exploded?
- I sell ladies' shoes.

17:57.607 --> 17:59.821
What do I know about
wave generators?

17:59.837 --> 18:01.261
Jake -- Owen Huber's dad.

18:01.276 --> 18:03.290
- I'm Christopher. I'm...
- Rory Gilmore's dad.

18:03.307 --> 18:05.211
I was just talking
to your wife.

18:05.225 --> 18:07.213
Um, actually, I'm not his wife.

18:07.227 --> 18:09.853
I didn't say that you were. I was
talking about his wife -- Mrs. Gilmore.

18:09.886 --> 18:12.081
She's over there
by the mimosas.

18:13.838 --> 18:15.690
Unbelievable.

18:16.017 --> 18:17.701
I'm sorry. Will you excuse me?

18:17.716 --> 18:20.011
I'm gonna go talk
to Mrs. Gilmore.

18:20.026 --> 18:21.940
Which lectures are
you guys gonna hit?

18:21.958 --> 18:24.740
And I said to him,
"they've tenured Bill Sunderland?

18:24.755 --> 18:27.003
Who's next -- Carmen Electra?"

18:27.776 --> 18:29.400
Good one, mom.

18:29.416 --> 18:32.102
Lorelai. If you'll excuse us?

18:32.116 --> 18:33.352
- Lorelai.
- Hi.

18:33.366 --> 18:35.551
Well. My goodness.
What on earth are you doing here?

18:35.568 --> 18:38.442
What am I doing here? I think the
question is, what are you doing here?

18:38.457 --> 18:39.953
It's Yale parents' weekend.

18:39.965 --> 18:41.550
Yes, but you are not a parent.

18:41.567 --> 18:42.743
I still can't
believe you're here.

18:42.775 --> 18:44.912
Mother, it's parents' weekend.
I'm a parent.

18:44.926 --> 18:46.682
That's why I'm here.
I'm a parent.

18:46.696 --> 18:47.762
And I'm a grandparent.

18:47.777 --> 18:49.223
Right. A grandparent,
not a parent.

18:49.237 --> 18:51.333
- A grandparent is a type of parent.
- No, it's not.

18:51.346 --> 18:53.442
A grand piano is a type of piano,
is it not?

18:53.455 --> 18:56.420
Well, you got me there, Riddler,
but I hope that logic works

18:56.435 --> 18:58.243
when I crash
grandparents' weekend.

18:58.256 --> 19:00.750
Oh, please, Lorelai.
Your father and I have been attending

19:00.765 --> 19:03.650
Rory's parents' weekends here at
Yale since her freshman year.

19:03.667 --> 19:05.051
It's one of our
little traditions.

19:05.066 --> 19:07.620
Hello, Rachel.
I'll see you at the field-hockey game?

19:07.635 --> 19:11.101
It's one of your little traditions
to pretend to be Rory's parents?

19:11.118 --> 19:12.673
Lorelai. What a surprise.

19:12.687 --> 19:15.310
Yes, it is a surprise. You know why?
'Cause you guys aren't parents.

19:15.348 --> 19:17.743
- Why are you here?
- I'm an alumnus, Lorelai.

19:17.755 --> 19:19.433
Also a visiting faculty member.

19:19.446 --> 19:21.053
And you'll remember,
until recently,

19:21.067 --> 19:24.462
your father and I were the ones taking
responsibility for Rory's tuition.

19:24.477 --> 19:25.702
Yes, I remember.

19:25.717 --> 19:28.003
We felt someone ought to attend,
for Rory's sake.

19:28.018 --> 19:29.560
It's obviously not
your kind of thing.

19:29.578 --> 19:31.292
What is that supposed to mean?

19:31.887 --> 19:33.531
Well, I'm glad you're here.

19:33.545 --> 19:35.361
Thank you. Me too.
What's that supposed to mean?

19:35.397 --> 19:38.871
You don't like these kinds of things --
things with schedules and nametags.

19:38.888 --> 19:40.373
You mock these kinds of things.

19:40.387 --> 19:42.430
Well, I'm here.
I'm not mocking. I'm brunching.

19:42.447 --> 19:44.253
I think you'll find
parents' weekend great fun.

19:44.285 --> 19:46.933
Thank you. It is. I am --
finding it great fun.

19:46.946 --> 19:49.441
We always tour the campus,
check in here at Branford,

19:49.457 --> 19:51.423
maybe take in a
faculty lecture or two,

19:51.436 --> 19:52.842
and then take Rory
out to dinner.

19:52.856 --> 19:54.373
You're taking Rory to dinner?

19:54.386 --> 19:56.853
We're going to chez
Zinjustin this year,

19:56.865 --> 19:58.701
a fabulous french restaurant.

19:58.718 --> 20:01.112
They have a crème brûlée
that is to die for.

20:01.126 --> 20:02.150
Well, that sounds like fun.

20:02.188 --> 20:05.100
Too bad you're gonna miss the
tour of the gemstones of Yale.

20:05.115 --> 20:07.282
The tour at Peabody?
I thought that was much earlier.

20:07.295 --> 20:09.801
Yes, well, it is --
for the general public.

20:09.817 --> 20:11.501
We signed up for a
special evening one.

20:11.516 --> 20:13.450
Chris and I signed
up weeks ago.

20:13.467 --> 20:14.442
Christopher's here?

20:14.457 --> 20:16.892
Yes, 'cause he's a parent.
It's his weekend, too.

20:16.906 --> 20:18.500
So, we'll go to the tour

20:18.516 --> 20:21.690
and then probably hit a few panels,
go to the --

20:21.708 --> 20:24.391
What is this you have on
your nametag -- "Zinf"?

20:24.408 --> 20:25.812
What is "Zinf"?
Some kind of joke?

20:25.825 --> 20:28.971
Oh, it's an old,
traditional Yale word... thingy.

20:28.985 --> 20:31.752
What is that word --
"Zinf"? Is it hebrew?

20:31.766 --> 20:33.042
Why is it on your nametag?

20:33.056 --> 20:35.141
You guys don't know?
I thought you were all into Yale.

20:35.176 --> 20:36.432
Hello, Emily. Richard.

20:36.448 --> 20:37.850
Christopher. Nice to see you.

20:37.867 --> 20:40.500
Hey, Lor, professor Quincy's
talk is about to start,

20:40.515 --> 20:41.742
and I know you
probably don't --

20:41.777 --> 20:45.121
Don't want to miss a word.
Yes, that's true.

20:45.135 --> 20:48.250
Well, we've got to go.
You enjoy your evening.

20:48.266 --> 20:51.382
Astrophysics waits for no man.

20:55.068 --> 20:58.032
When supernovae explode,
they emit an energy

20:58.045 --> 21:01.313
that is 4 billion times
greater than the sun.

21:01.327 --> 21:03.571
So powerful are these
explosions that even though

21:03.587 --> 21:06.600
they're occurring halfway
across the observable universe,

21:06.617 --> 21:09.142
some 7 billion
light-years away...

21:09.157 --> 21:10.641
My parents have got a lot of nerve,
you know?

21:10.676 --> 21:12.910
That's one thing they've got,
is nerve.

21:12.928 --> 21:14.662
They should put
it to good use --

21:14.677 --> 21:17.151
start a knife-throwing
contest or something.

21:17.165 --> 21:18.312
Lor...

21:18.325 --> 21:20.141
I mean, lunch? Please.

21:20.157 --> 21:21.431
They get dinner,
and we get lunch?

21:21.467 --> 21:23.553
Lunch is such a booby prize.

21:23.566 --> 21:25.100
...we would be able to see

21:25.117 --> 21:28.292
that the expansion of the
universe was slowing down.

21:28.305 --> 21:31.500
I just can't believe Rory didn't tell
us that they were coming, you know.

21:31.517 --> 21:36.693
Berate her. "Rory...
you... little... rat."

21:36.708 --> 21:40.131
But we've learned that the expansion
of the universe is not slowing down --

21:40.146 --> 21:41.811
It's speeding up.

21:41.826 --> 21:45.411
She says that she assumed that
we knew they were coming.

21:45.425 --> 21:48.582
"When you assume,
you make an --"

21:48.596 --> 21:50.132
Shh!

21:50.147 --> 21:53.383
Something else is
happening in the universe

21:53.396 --> 21:56.011
that is counteracting the
powerful force of gravity,

21:56.026 --> 21:58.393
and that's what we
call "dark energy."

21:58.408 --> 22:02.041
Hey, you know what?
We should have lunch at chez Zinjustin.

22:02.056 --> 22:03.992
I hear they have a
crème brûlée to die for.

22:04.005 --> 22:06.090
- Sure. Sounds good.
- Okay.

22:07.357 --> 22:08.963
You can't make a
phone call in here.

22:08.975 --> 22:10.913
I want to make sure
we get a reservation.

22:10.927 --> 22:12.170
...back in the 1930s.

22:12.186 --> 22:14.671
So, it may be that Einstein
was right all along.

22:14.686 --> 22:18.271
Turns out the guy
was pretty smart.

22:21.866 --> 22:24.163
All right,
are there any questions?

22:24.176 --> 22:25.021
Yes?

22:25.036 --> 22:26.723
Yeah, how can we tell
whether dark energy

22:26.736 --> 22:29.310
is the same thing as the
cosmological constant?

22:29.328 --> 22:30.943
Excellent question.

22:30.958 --> 22:34.250
More thorough measurement from
observatories on the ground,

22:34.266 --> 22:36.851
from the Hbble
Space Telescope...

22:40.656 --> 22:42.631
I was making
ratatouille anyway.

22:42.646 --> 22:44.081
Excuse me?

22:44.105 --> 22:47.691
Perfectly good vegetables,
and I was making ratatouille anyway,

22:47.707 --> 22:49.923
and no sense in wasting them.

22:49.937 --> 22:51.733
Did I miss something?

22:52.515 --> 22:55.191
Not like there's anything
to feel guilty about.

22:55.207 --> 22:57.421
Jackson sells his
vegetables all over town.

22:57.436 --> 22:59.732
I'm not just gonna
throw these away.

22:59.745 --> 23:02.633
Just because Lorelai is away
does not mean that I'm obligated

23:02.647 --> 23:05.061
to listen to your
incessant prattling.

23:05.076 --> 23:07.592
I mean,
it would be wrong to waste vegetables.

23:07.608 --> 23:09.752
Wasting vegetables is wrong.

23:09.766 --> 23:11.863
I will listen to you
on one condition.

23:11.876 --> 23:13.390
Call me "captain."

23:13.405 --> 23:15.321
- No.
- Fine.

23:16.076 --> 23:18.982
Okay... captain.

23:20.976 --> 23:22.111
Yes?

23:22.127 --> 23:25.443
The point is that Jackson's
vegetables are top-of-the-line,

23:25.458 --> 23:26.522
first-rate.

23:26.538 --> 23:30.562
But they're his vegetables,
you know, and these aren't.

23:30.577 --> 23:32.320
These have something
different to offer,

23:32.336 --> 23:34.882
and I shouldn't feel
guilty about --

23:34.895 --> 23:38.262
You know what?
It's not worth it.

23:41.395 --> 23:43.452
It's just ratatouille, okay?

23:43.467 --> 23:45.652
Nothing to get all
riled up about.

23:46.577 --> 23:48.543
Caesar, I'm back.

23:48.628 --> 23:50.943
Hey, Luke, you want 
to grab a cold one tonight,

23:50.956 --> 23:53.052
- bird-dog some chicas?
- What?

23:53.068 --> 23:57.250
As of 0700 this evening,
I'm going to be a free man.

23:57.268 --> 23:58.940
- You are?
- I am.

23:58.956 --> 24:02.961
Giving Lulu the old heave-ho,
hitting the eject button.

24:02.978 --> 24:04.072
Kirk?

24:04.086 --> 24:05.542
I owe it all to you, buddy.

24:05.556 --> 24:06.400
Me?

24:06.416 --> 24:07.792
You inspired me.

24:07.806 --> 24:10.622
I look at you, and I think,
"this guy's doing it right.

24:10.637 --> 24:12.612
Slave to no master."

24:12.628 --> 24:15.502
You come home at 3:00 in the morning --
no one cares.

24:15.518 --> 24:18.283
You want to eat dessert for dinner --
no one cares.

24:18.295 --> 24:20.753
You walk around in tube
socks and tighty whities --

24:20.767 --> 24:22.183
no one cares.

24:22.198 --> 24:25.651
No one cares what you
do or where you go.

24:26.088 --> 24:28.042
So, what do you say, Luke?

24:28.058 --> 24:30.142
You want to be my wingman,

24:30.155 --> 24:31.942
Goose to my Maverick?

24:31.958 --> 24:35.601
# You never close your eyes anymore #

24:35.615 --> 24:38.311
# When I kiss your lips #

24:38.328 --> 24:40.321
# And there's no tenderness -- #

24:40.336 --> 24:41.993
Listen, you pinhead,

24:42.008 --> 24:44.580
you should be kissing the
ground that Lulu walks on.

24:44.597 --> 24:47.733
Why that sweet girl lets you
within a hundred miles of her

24:47.745 --> 24:49.943
is beyond me, but she does.

24:49.958 --> 24:53.132
You are the luckiest man on the
planet to have a girl like that

24:53.146 --> 24:55.293
looking out for you
and caring about you.

24:55.308 --> 24:57.812
And if you say so much as
one unkind word to her,

24:57.828 --> 25:00.970
I will personally break
every bone in your body.

25:00.988 --> 25:02.710
You got me?

25:11.738 --> 25:13.473
So, what did you end up
putting on the front page?

25:13.506 --> 25:14.660
Don't play dumb, Paris.

25:14.677 --> 25:17.163
My early-admission/early-actions piece.
No kidding.

25:17.176 --> 25:18.800
It was a good article.

25:18.816 --> 25:21.060
I'm hardly ever here anymore,
I'm putting in minimal effort

25:21.098 --> 25:23.762
when I am here, and yet my article
is still the front-page lead.

25:23.775 --> 25:24.803
It's almost too easy.

25:24.816 --> 25:26.503
It's not locked yet, Paris.

25:26.517 --> 25:28.812
Okay, A.K., you're gonna take
care of that Lacrosse caption?

25:28.846 --> 25:29.990
What was wrong with what I had?

25:30.028 --> 25:32.712
Well, you might save the metaphors
and alliterations for poetry class

25:32.747 --> 25:34.122
and give me something
short and snappy.

25:34.155 --> 25:35.783
And you might want
to mention Lacrosse.

25:35.796 --> 25:36.600
You got it.

25:36.618 --> 25:39.343
- I love how bossy she is.
- Well, she is their boss.

25:39.358 --> 25:40.703
Yeah, I love that.

25:40.718 --> 25:42.831
She's like a dictator,
only cute and nonviolent.

25:42.846 --> 25:44.843
And instead of a country,
she has a newspaper.

25:44.858 --> 25:47.382
"Yale Lacrosse team sticks
it to Ivy League rivals"?

25:47.395 --> 25:49.760
Done. Okay, so, A.K.
will take care of that.

25:49.777 --> 25:52.253
And good job, everybody.
Layout is locked.

25:52.265 --> 25:55.192
It's funny. It's almost like I'd have
to work harder not to get the front page.

25:55.205 --> 25:56.712
Oh, hi, parents.

25:56.728 --> 25:59.293
You are the cutest
fascist ever.

25:59.307 --> 26:01.013
So, how was the morning?

26:01.025 --> 26:03.903
Brunch was lovely, except of course
for my parents skulking around,

26:03.915 --> 26:06.323
which no one warned me about.
Hey, I forgot -- I'm still mad at you.

26:06.356 --> 26:07.443
Don't be mad at me.

26:07.457 --> 26:09.653
All right, fine. But only 'cause
you're the cutest despot ever.

26:09.687 --> 26:10.453
What else?

26:10.466 --> 26:12.962
We had a few close
brushes with a cappella.

26:12.976 --> 26:14.181
That was a narrow escape.

26:14.198 --> 26:16.221
We were taking a shortcut on
the way to the lecture hall,

26:16.256 --> 26:17.723
and we almost
shortcutted our way

26:17.737 --> 26:20.532
into a group of guys wearing
tuxedos singing "zombie jamboree."

26:20.547 --> 26:21.693
You guys went to a lecture?

26:21.706 --> 26:24.502
Yes, where I learned that
the universe is expanding

26:24.515 --> 26:26.961
and that your dad is a
big question-asking geek.

26:26.978 --> 26:30.381
Hey, we have come to take you
to lunch at chez Zinjustin.

26:30.398 --> 26:31.650
Wow. Fancy.

26:31.666 --> 26:33.730
Apparently, the crème
brûlée is to die for.

26:33.745 --> 26:35.261
Since when do you
say "to die for"?

26:35.277 --> 26:36.773
Since he got addicted
to "Project Runway."

26:36.806 --> 26:37.923
Make it work.

26:37.937 --> 26:39.331
You guys should meet everybody.

26:39.346 --> 26:43.511
Mom and dad, this is Sheila,
Bill, A.K., Raj, and Joni.

26:43.525 --> 26:45.453
- This is Christopher and Lorelai.
- Hello!

26:45.466 --> 26:46.882
And you know Paris, of course.

26:46.896 --> 26:48.162
Lorelai. It's been too long.

26:48.177 --> 26:49.973
Hi. Oh. Wow. Okay.

26:49.988 --> 26:51.231
And you know Christopher.

26:51.245 --> 26:53.343
I believe we've met in passing.
Good to see you, Chris.

26:53.375 --> 26:54.662
Good to see you.

26:54.757 --> 26:57.652
We're just going to chez
Zinjustin for lunch.

26:57.666 --> 26:59.150
You mean "Chez fancy pants."

26:59.168 --> 27:01.993
My dad took me and my roommates
there for dinner freshman year --

27:02.007 --> 27:04.433
back when he still loved me.
It's supernice.

27:04.446 --> 27:06.523
I hear they match your napkin
to what you're wearing.

27:06.558 --> 27:09.253
I hear they fold your
napkin into an origami swan

27:09.267 --> 27:10.543
every time you leave the table.

27:10.557 --> 27:13.363
I don't know for the napkins, but I
hear the crème brûlée is to die for.

27:13.397 --> 27:15.643
- I heard that, too.
- You know what? You should all come along.

27:15.675 --> 27:16.982
- Who? Us?
- Sure.

27:16.998 --> 27:19.063
- Hey, let's bring the whole gang.
- Oh, dad, you don't have to --

27:19.097 --> 27:21.223
I want to. It'll give me a chance
to get to know your friends.

27:21.255 --> 27:22.823
- People might have plans.
- None.

27:22.837 --> 27:24.620
- There's a shocker.
- I'm starving.

27:24.635 --> 27:27.842
Well, all right, then.
Come on. Lunch on Rory's dad.

27:27.857 --> 27:30.043
- Thank you.
- Cool.

27:37.818 --> 27:40.352
Ah, thank you.
The wine is wonderful.

27:40.365 --> 27:42.483
I'm so glad you're enjoying it.

27:42.497 --> 27:45.041
Hey, this is a french restaurant.
Shouldn't all the servers be french?

27:45.075 --> 27:48.160
Je ne suis pas français, mais je peux
parler français, si vous préférez.

27:48.176 --> 27:51.580
Uh, where is the
nearest subway station?

27:52.398 --> 27:55.162
- Another bottle, sir?
- Absolutely.

27:55.177 --> 27:58.190
Anyway, the chalet in Killington
had this open floor plan,

27:58.207 --> 28:00.323
sort of the way Rory's
apartment's laid out.

28:00.337 --> 28:02.413
I've never exactly
seen Rory's apartment.

28:02.428 --> 28:03.323
Oh yeah?

28:03.337 --> 28:06.352
We mostly just hang at the paper and --
mostly at the paper.

28:06.365 --> 28:09.203
Anyway, I really want to rent a
place at a ski resort this winter,

28:09.217 --> 28:11.451
maybe Killington or Sugarloaf.

28:11.465 --> 28:12.531
That sounds great.

28:12.545 --> 28:14.533
You know, you should come --
totally.

28:14.546 --> 28:17.030
We'll get all of Rory's friends
together for a long weekend,

28:17.047 --> 28:18.890
ski, hang out.
It'b be a blast.

28:18.907 --> 28:20.363
A ski trip sounds awesome.

28:20.376 --> 28:21.222
Who's going skiing?

28:21.237 --> 28:23.472
You are -- this winter.
Everyone's invited.

28:23.485 --> 28:24.490
Right on.

28:24.508 --> 28:26.823
You don't hang out with any of these
people outside the paper, do you?

28:26.857 --> 28:28.183
Not so much.

28:28.195 --> 28:30.761
Okay. Who wants dessert?

28:30.776 --> 28:33.220
I'd love a crème brûlée.
I've never had crème brûlée.

28:33.236 --> 28:34.482
I could do with a cognac.

28:34.498 --> 28:36.002
I wouldn't say no
to a digestif.

28:36.018 --> 28:38.332
Crème brûlée for me.
And a cognac.

28:38.346 --> 28:41.340
You know, I think we'd like to get
crème brûlée and cognac all around.

28:41.358 --> 28:42.931
- Sorry.
- Why sorry?

28:42.947 --> 28:44.893
- Sorry if this lunch is weird.
- No.

28:44.905 --> 28:47.520
- Rory...
- Okay, this lunch is weird.

28:47.825 --> 28:50.343
I feel like we're those
lame-o parents of yore.

28:50.355 --> 28:51.870
Dad is trying kind of hard.

28:51.885 --> 28:54.252
Yeah. Any minute,
he's gonna start juggling plates.

28:54.268 --> 28:55.721
And hanging spoons
off his nose.

28:55.735 --> 28:57.240
Yeah, but it's sweet.

28:57.256 --> 28:59.050
Seriously, whenever you
guys get a 3-day weekend,

28:59.087 --> 29:01.140
- you should totally come up.
- Can we rent skis there?

29:01.178 --> 29:02.840
Sure, or I can lend you a pair.

29:02.856 --> 29:05.900
We'll have you jumping moguls down
a black diamond in no time, Raj.

29:05.916 --> 29:08.762
I guess it's good that I experience
a little bit of lame-o parenting.

29:08.775 --> 29:12.430
I mean, It's part of the quintessential
college experience, isn't it?

29:12.448 --> 29:13.240
I guess.

29:13.255 --> 29:15.113
And it's great that you
got to meet the whole gang

29:15.146 --> 29:18.063
before our big ski
vacation together.

29:19.017 --> 29:21.302
- Uh-oh.
- "Uh-oh" good or "uh-oh" bad?

29:21.315 --> 29:23.193
I guess there isn't really
an "uh-oh" good, is there?

29:23.225 --> 29:26.481
Listen up, guys. A bunch of students
that were protesting the war

29:26.498 --> 29:28.300
took over president
Stewart's office.

29:28.315 --> 29:30.163
It's look like we're gonna have
to rework the whole edition.

29:30.198 --> 29:31.610
Why can't the news stop
while we're eating?

29:31.648 --> 29:34.340
- I know, it's so impolite.
- I just got a text with a photo.

29:34.358 --> 29:37.573
Looks like they're wearing
George Bush masks and...

29:38.105 --> 29:40.133
Are those Condoleezza
Rice masks?

29:40.146 --> 29:41.342
They make Condoleezza masks?

29:41.356 --> 29:42.740
We've got to get on
this, everybody.

29:42.776 --> 29:44.480
Um, so you guys, I'm sorry,
look like we've...

29:44.515 --> 29:45.863
- It's okay, go.
- Duty calls.

29:45.877 --> 29:48.160
Okay, Sheila,
get Keith on the phone

29:48.175 --> 29:50.493
and see if you can get him down there.
Actually, get Samantha down there, too.

29:50.525 --> 29:52.823
I want so many photos of this thing,
I can make a flip book.

29:52.838 --> 29:56.261
Bill and A.K., get back to the office so 
you can proof the stories or emailing it in.

29:56.275 --> 29:57.331
Everyone else, you're with me.

29:57.365 --> 29:59.251
- What about the crème brûlée?
- And our cognac?

29:59.265 --> 30:01.612
I have yet to taste the
sweet nectar of crème brûlée.

30:01.628 --> 30:02.880
This is going to
be our front page.

30:02.917 --> 30:04.233
Front page? Really?

30:04.248 --> 30:05.640
I think the front page
is fine as it is.

30:05.678 --> 30:06.271
Paris...

30:06.288 --> 30:08.733
Come on. We all know these
rabble-rousers are just looking
for attention.

30:08.766 --> 30:10.182
- Why indulge them ?
- Let's go.

30:10.198 --> 30:12.901
I want to go.
I want to report this story.

30:12.918 --> 30:15.290
I just want to do it after
I eat my crème brûlée.

30:15.305 --> 30:16.993
I mean, what if tonight 
I get hit by lightning

30:17.028 --> 30:19.310
and die a crème-Brûlée virgin?

30:19.325 --> 30:21.040
A crème-Brûlée virgin?

30:21.055 --> 30:23.651
You know what? Enough.
This is a major political protest.

30:23.666 --> 30:26.040
It's a big story,
and it's going to go on our front page.

30:26.058 --> 30:28.541
Now get your drunk, crème-brûlée-craving
asses out of these chairs,

30:28.575 --> 30:30.131
and let's get to work, okay?

30:30.145 --> 30:32.221
Besides the lead,
I'm going to need some color --

30:32.238 --> 30:33.771
what's going on behind the masks,
that kind of things.

30:33.806 --> 30:35.041
Joni, you want to
take a crack at that?

30:35.075 --> 30:36.301
I'm a little tipsy.

30:36.316 --> 30:38.280
Okay, is there anyone
who's not a little tipsy?

30:38.298 --> 30:39.863
Thanks for lunch, dad.

30:39.878 --> 30:41.263
- Thank you.
- Lunch was great.

30:41.277 --> 30:43.383
- Great meeting you.
- See you later.

30:45.877 --> 30:49.242
Well, I hope you're hungry
for some crème brûlée.

30:50.406 --> 30:52.900
Are you sure you want to
fianchetto that bishop so early?

30:52.918 --> 30:54.921
I don't know,
it depends on what "fianchetto" means.

30:54.956 --> 30:57.330
It means I'm gonna kick your
butt if you make that move.

30:57.346 --> 30:58.993
Well, you're kicking my butt anyway,
so I don't see

30:59.025 --> 31:00.801
how one fianchetto is gonna
make much of a difference.

31:00.836 --> 31:03.800
Besides, it sounds fancy and make me seem like
I know what I'm doing.

31:03.817 --> 31:05.521
You're not very good.

31:05.535 --> 31:06.881
April.

31:06.895 --> 31:08.571
Sorry. I can be blunt.

31:08.587 --> 31:09.742
Tell it like it is, sister.

31:09.758 --> 31:11.761
Besides, later tonight,
when we Boggle,

31:11.777 --> 31:14.041
which is what I was told
we'd be playing tonight,

31:14.055 --> 31:16.730
it is your butt that is going to be
kicked, because I've been studying

31:16.766 --> 31:19.400
my 7-letter words that
sound made-up but aren't.

31:19.415 --> 31:22.170
"Palfrey" -- P-A-L-F-R-E-Y.

31:22.186 --> 31:23.432
It's a saddle
horse for a woman.

31:23.467 --> 31:24.131
Impressive.

31:24.145 --> 31:27.021
Okay, so,
coach Bennett and I are gonna go out

31:27.035 --> 31:30.111
and have some dinner together and talk,
and then I'll be home.

31:30.126 --> 31:31.480
Shouldn't be more
than a couple hours.

31:31.518 --> 31:33.672
Just a dinner and some talking.

31:33.688 --> 31:36.302
It would be weird if it was
a dinner with no talking.

31:36.317 --> 31:37.062
Sure.

31:37.077 --> 31:40.200
And you should probably call her "Susan"
tonight, instead of "coach Bennett" --

31:40.236 --> 31:41.961
- I think she'd prefer that.
- Good tip.

31:41.975 --> 31:43.131
We'll hang out
until you get back.

31:43.167 --> 31:44.642
Okay, you got the number
of the restaurant.

31:44.675 --> 31:47.811
I'm gonna have my cellphone on me,
so if there are any problems --

31:47.825 --> 31:49.631
Thank you, Luke. Bye.

31:49.647 --> 31:51.233
- Bye, dad.
- See you later.

31:54.668 --> 31:56.640
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

31:56.658 --> 31:58.733
Okay, now,
it's your move, darlin',

31:58.747 --> 32:02.730
unless you'd rather discuss zymurgy --
Z-Y-M-U-R-G-Y --

32:02.747 --> 32:05.312
the branch of applied chemistry
dealing with fermentation.

32:05.328 --> 32:07.552
All right, all right.
We can play Boggle.

32:07.567 --> 32:09.012
Yes!

32:12.295 --> 32:13.810
Hello. Two?

32:13.828 --> 32:15.553
Okay, right this way.

32:20.036 --> 32:21.423
There you go.

32:22.975 --> 32:24.401
Your waitress will
be right with you.

32:24.436 --> 32:26.932
Thank you.
Oh, no. Come sit with me.

32:26.948 --> 32:29.280
- There?
- Yeah. It's cozier.

32:29.296 --> 32:30.240
Oh. Okay.

32:30.258 --> 32:32.610
I hate being so far away.

32:37.027 --> 32:39.212
- Wow!
- I know, right?

32:39.227 --> 32:41.070
It's my favorite restaurant.

32:41.085 --> 32:42.733
And you said you liked 
to eat healthy, so --

32:42.768 --> 32:44.462
Yeah. Huh.
I've never eaten this healthy.

32:44.477 --> 32:46.842
So, "vegan" doesn't
just mean "vegetarian."

32:46.857 --> 32:49.220
No --
no animal products of any kind.

32:49.237 --> 32:51.243
No eggs, no milk, no cheese.

32:51.256 --> 32:52.322
Just soy everything.

32:52.337 --> 32:54.203
Soy steak is scrumptious.

32:54.218 --> 32:55.843
I swear you totally can't
tell the difference.

32:55.878 --> 32:57.353
Oh, I bet I can.

32:57.367 --> 32:59.712
So, Luke,
let me ask you a question.

32:59.726 --> 33:00.853
Okay.

33:00.936 --> 33:05.651
Who would play you in
the Luke Danes movie?

33:06.155 --> 33:07.733
- Huh?
- Alive or dead.

33:07.748 --> 33:10.630
Uh... I never really
thought about that.

33:10.647 --> 33:12.071
Take your time.
Do you want to know mine?

33:12.105 --> 33:13.400
Sure.

33:14.125 --> 33:16.340
Marlene Dietrich. Right?

33:16.357 --> 33:18.410
- I don't know who that is.
- Sure you do.

33:18.425 --> 33:19.722
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

33:19.736 --> 33:20.743
- Think.
- I don't.

33:20.755 --> 33:23.591
"Touch of evil," "The
lady is willing,"

33:23.605 --> 33:24.941
"Destry rides again."

33:24.957 --> 33:29.551
"Your husband would rather be
cheated by me than married to you."

33:29.566 --> 33:30.910
Oh, yeah, sure.

33:30.927 --> 33:33.092
My last boyfriend --
"the ex" --

33:33.108 --> 33:35.341
He was always
calling me "Marlene!"

33:35.356 --> 33:37.420
Oh, you know what?
I think you might know him.

33:37.438 --> 33:38.951
Bob McCullough, Laura's father?

33:38.968 --> 33:40.931
No, I don't think I do.

33:40.945 --> 33:43.813
We lived together
for four months,

33:43.827 --> 33:47.452
and then he just
went totally psycho.

33:47.466 --> 33:49.051
- Psycho!
- ...egg corns.

33:49.065 --> 33:51.643
I swore I wasn't gonna date any
more single dads after that,

33:51.657 --> 33:54.180
but here I am.

33:54.947 --> 33:56.793
You hooked me.

33:56.805 --> 34:00.693
Well, you know what they say --
third time's a charm.

34:00.706 --> 34:01.942
Can I get anybody a drink?

34:01.958 --> 34:03.382
Yes, please.

34:03.395 --> 34:05.883
I heard a bone crack,
several bones cracking.

34:05.898 --> 34:07.542
Crack, crack, crack --
it was like fireworks.

34:07.578 --> 34:09.493
Rugby is a violent sport.

34:09.507 --> 34:11.880
I guess the fact that an ambulance
was parked by the side of the field

34:11.917 --> 34:14.003
before the game even started
should've been my first clue.

34:14.034 --> 34:17.213
They don't park ambulances
next to tetherball matches.

34:17.228 --> 34:19.331
I can't believe we lost.
It was so violent.

34:19.344 --> 34:21.263
I guess they were
just violenter.

34:21.277 --> 34:23.041
Uh, it's Rory.

34:23.056 --> 34:24.713
They're at the paper.
They're still working.

34:24.745 --> 34:25.641
Man!

34:25.656 --> 34:28.203
Half of them are
drunk or hung over.

34:28.215 --> 34:29.330
Joni passed out.

34:29.348 --> 34:30.353
Oh, jeez.

34:30.367 --> 34:31.873
Looks like she's gonna
be there all night.

34:31.906 --> 34:33.433
Oh, that's not good news.

34:33.447 --> 34:35.440
Well, silver lining --

34:35.456 --> 34:38.083
that means she won't get to
have dinner with my parents.

34:38.096 --> 34:41.400
We got the only meal.
We won parents' weekend,

34:41.415 --> 34:42.900
and we didn't even
break any bones.

34:42.918 --> 34:44.670
Yeah. Some meal.

34:44.685 --> 34:45.911
What's wrong?

34:45.925 --> 34:49.400
Nothing. I just --
I... I screwed up.

34:49.416 --> 34:50.520
What do you mean,
you screwed up?

34:50.554 --> 34:53.023
It's my fault that Rory's
got to work all night.

34:53.036 --> 34:55.610
What do you mean?
You staged the student protest?

34:55.628 --> 34:58.972
You wore a condi mask and manacled
yourself to the president's door?

34:58.985 --> 35:00.933
The big meal,
ordering all that wine.

35:00.947 --> 35:02.630
Her staff's a mess.
It's my fault.

35:02.645 --> 35:04.223
Honey, if those kids are
gonna be journalists,

35:04.255 --> 35:05.653
they have to learn
to write drunk.

35:05.666 --> 35:07.791
I'm trying to be
superdad or something.

35:07.807 --> 35:09.411
- Why?
- I don't know.

35:09.425 --> 35:12.242
Does it have to do with the nametag-
in-the-middle-of-the-chest thing?

35:12.708 --> 35:15.261
At the brunch, all the other
dads were talking about how

35:15.275 --> 35:18.993
they took their kids to hockey
practice and violin lessons

35:19.006 --> 35:20.832
and helped them study
for the S.A.T.s,

35:20.846 --> 35:23.311
and I just stood there like a jerk,
nodding my head

35:23.326 --> 35:24.772
like I'd done all those things.

35:24.787 --> 35:25.772
Oh, honey.

35:25.788 --> 35:27.482
I didn't do any
of those things.

35:27.497 --> 35:30.713
First of all, Rory didn't need
someone to check her homework.

35:30.725 --> 35:32.080
She was a self-starter.

35:32.097 --> 35:33.801
Second of all,
she wasn't interested in hockey.

35:33.837 --> 35:36.543
And third of all,
you don't have to try to be superdad.

35:36.557 --> 35:37.750
I feel like I should be.

35:37.765 --> 35:40.253
No. You can just relax,
you know?

35:40.268 --> 35:42.412
Be yourself.
Be the dad that you are --

35:42.426 --> 35:44.870
Clark Kent dad,
Christopher Hayden dad.

35:44.885 --> 35:46.130
I guess.

35:46.145 --> 35:47.901
Totally.

35:48.458 --> 35:50.220
It's just -- it's too late.

35:50.238 --> 35:52.952
I mean, I've got G.G.,
and that's great, but Rory --

35:52.968 --> 35:54.962
Rory's grown up. I missed it.

35:54.976 --> 35:56.043
You didn't miss it.

35:56.057 --> 35:57.560
She's a senior in college, Lor.

35:57.577 --> 35:59.562
We have years of hard
parenting ahead.

35:59.578 --> 36:01.930
She is due for a
quarter-life crisis.

36:01.945 --> 36:04.081
All those years of
stability do not bode well.

36:04.095 --> 36:05.233
We're gonna have plenty to do.

36:05.267 --> 36:06.793
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

36:06.807 --> 36:08.733
And the best part is...

36:08.747 --> 36:10.611
we get to deal
with it together.

36:10.628 --> 36:12.693
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

36:13.147 --> 36:14.962
Quarter-life crisis, huh?

36:14.976 --> 36:18.072
I'm pretty sure she's gonna
spin wildly out of control.

36:18.088 --> 36:20.990
We're gonna have to do an intervention,
put her through rehab,

36:21.008 --> 36:24.923
give her a place to stay while
she's divorcing the hell's angel.

36:24.936 --> 36:28.822
# It don't make a difference #
# If we make it or not #

36:28.837 --> 36:32.592
# We've both got one another #
# And that's a lot #

36:32.607 --> 36:36.761
# For love #
# Let's give it a shot #

36:36.775 --> 36:40.753
# Whoooa #
# We're halfway there #

36:40.767 --> 36:44.923
# Ohhh, ohhh #
# We're livin' on a prayer #

36:45.618 --> 36:47.952
Divine. The tomatoes
are so fresh and meaty.

36:47.968 --> 36:49.400
The eggplant is what
puts it over the top.

36:49.435 --> 36:50.983
Perfect sweetness.
Your best ever.

36:50.995 --> 36:52.311
Well, I wouldn't say my best.

36:52.327 --> 36:55.223
It is. It's a whole new level of flavor,
like a vegetable symphony.

36:55.236 --> 36:56.282
What do you think, captain?

36:56.318 --> 36:58.102
It's true.
It even surpasses my mother's,

36:58.115 --> 37:00.411
and that woman made
ratatouille for a living.

37:00.428 --> 37:02.631
Well done, Sookie.

37:02.646 --> 37:03.991
Brava, maestra.

37:04.006 --> 37:05.441
It's just ratatouille, okay?

37:05.455 --> 37:07.412
Now, go get back to work.

37:07.425 --> 37:09.140
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

37:09.576 --> 37:10.910
- Hey.
- Hey!

37:10.928 --> 37:13.073
- You ready to go?
- Ready, Freddy!

37:13.087 --> 37:14.791
Just dropped the kids
off at the Bstics'.

37:14.806 --> 37:16.752
They made me take
my shoes off again.

37:16.766 --> 37:18.200
They make everybody
take off their shoes.

37:18.235 --> 37:20.750
I can't remember the last time I saw
the Bstics in anything but socks.

37:20.787 --> 37:23.803
Then they had the audacity to
complain that my feet smell.

37:23.818 --> 37:24.922
They really complained?

37:24.937 --> 37:27.270
Well, they made sour faces
when I wasn't looking

37:27.286 --> 37:29.980
- and rolled their eyes.
- Oh, Jackson.

37:29.997 --> 37:32.183
What do they expect?
Of course my feet smell.

37:32.197 --> 37:33.891
I work in the fields all day.

37:33.907 --> 37:36.923
That's why I wear these big zip boots --
in order to contain the smell.

37:36.937 --> 37:38.781
I swear, the next time they
come over to the house,

37:38.815 --> 37:41.001
I'm gonna ask them to take
off their pants or something.

37:41.036 --> 37:42.192
It's outrageous!

37:42.208 --> 37:44.580
- I'm sorry, honey.
- Yeah, well...

37:44.598 --> 37:47.661
I know the Bostics
are a little nutso.

37:47.675 --> 37:50.033
Very nutso.
Who irons their couch?

37:50.048 --> 37:52.261
But Martha and Davy
love going over there

37:52.276 --> 37:54.623
and playing with Kayla and Ryan,
and when they come back,

37:54.636 --> 37:58.751
they're so polite and cordial
for like an hour, which is nice.

37:58.768 --> 38:00.490
That is a bonus, but still.

38:00.506 --> 38:03.423
I know. I'll get my purse.

38:10.378 --> 38:11.603
No!

38:11.615 --> 38:13.951
- What?
- Ooh! Bad batch!

38:13.967 --> 38:16.071
Saving it for the horses.

38:16.085 --> 38:18.380
But you never mess
up your ratatouille.

38:18.397 --> 38:21.271
Everyone's allowed a mistake
or two here and there.

38:21.287 --> 38:23.641
You know what?
I'm just gonna -- just junk it.

38:23.657 --> 38:25.652
Are you sure?
It smells fantastic.

38:25.668 --> 38:27.650
I'm sure. Trust me --
it's awful.

38:27.666 --> 38:29.581
Hey, you know what
I was thinking?

38:29.597 --> 38:33.102
What do you think about a
nice romantic dinner, huh?

38:33.117 --> 38:34.060
How about Cicero's?

38:34.075 --> 38:35.652
Wow. Cicero's.

38:35.667 --> 38:36.710
Yeah.

38:36.726 --> 38:38.442
They have good ratatouille.

38:38.458 --> 38:40.842
Okay, so long as I
can keep my shoes on.

38:40.858 --> 38:44.211
Unless Cicero's has suddenly gone
japanese, I think we're good.

39:10.738 --> 39:14.373
The first name that
I'm going to call is...

39:14.817 --> 39:16.072
A.J.

39:16.087 --> 39:17.933
She was very well-behaved.

39:17.946 --> 39:19.953
Glad to hear it. Lane?

39:20.848 --> 39:22.510
- Hey, Luke.
- I'm home.

39:22.528 --> 39:24.881
You zonked out about
20 minutes ago.

39:24.897 --> 39:28.161
Well, I should probably do the rest
of my zonking in my own apartment.

39:28.177 --> 39:30.320
Thank you for hanging out
with me tonight, April.

39:30.337 --> 39:31.263
My pleasure.

39:31.276 --> 39:33.640
- See you tomorrow, Luke.
- See you tomorrow, Lane.

39:34.535 --> 39:36.131
So, you guys had fun?

39:36.146 --> 39:38.103
Totally. Lane's awesome.

39:38.135 --> 39:39.682
How about you?

39:39.697 --> 39:44.032
It was nice, you know?
We had vegan food.

39:44.048 --> 39:46.030
Ooh. You couldn't
have liked that.

39:46.047 --> 39:50.043
I did not, but coach Bennett
really seemed to enjoy it.

39:50.057 --> 39:52.782
So, you're still calling
her "coach Bennett"?

39:52.796 --> 39:56.002
I think she'll just remain
"coach Bennett" to me.

39:56.015 --> 39:57.532
That's cool.

39:58.007 --> 40:00.411
Hey, is that pizza
still up for grabs?

40:00.425 --> 40:02.661
- Go crazy.
- Oh. I'm starving.

40:02.678 --> 40:04.483
Real cheese.

40:04.496 --> 40:07.263
We also ordered sticky buns.

40:07.278 --> 40:08.923
Bring it on.

40:17.015 --> 40:18.811
No quote from
president Stewart yet?

40:18.826 --> 40:19.450
Nothing.

40:19.465 --> 40:20.613
Have we picked the photo?

40:20.625 --> 40:22.073
Sheila's got some
options for you.

40:22.088 --> 40:24.022
- Layout's coming along.
- Good. Okay.

40:24.038 --> 40:26.191
Keep it moving.
We have a deadline here.

40:26.207 --> 40:28.471
Ow! Who made this
phone so loud?

40:28.488 --> 40:30.462
Yale Daily News.

40:31.788 --> 40:32.790
Will do.

40:32.807 --> 40:34.812
We got ourselves a quote.
Steve's e-mailing it in now.

40:34.846 --> 40:36.780
Great. Okay, would you mind
inputting these corrections?

40:36.818 --> 40:38.722
Anything to get away
from that phone.

40:38.736 --> 40:40.021
Hey, gang.

40:40.036 --> 40:41.012
Hey.

40:41.028 --> 40:42.560
We come bearing
doughnuts and coffee.

40:42.578 --> 40:44.993
Gather 'round.
The chocolate eclairs are to die for.

40:45.008 --> 40:46.010
Thanks, guys.

40:46.026 --> 40:48.180
We figured you'd need some
all-nighter supplies.

40:48.197 --> 40:52.551
Hey. So, um, I'm sorry about
getting your staff drunk.

40:52.568 --> 40:53.720
Oh, don't worry about it.

40:53.736 --> 40:55.091
You seemed pretty upset
at the restaurant.

40:55.126 --> 40:56.762
I was just stressed out.
It's no big deal.

40:56.797 --> 40:58.253
- So, you're not mad?
- No.

40:58.265 --> 41:01.552
But dad, I think I would've liked
it better if on parents' weekend,

41:01.567 --> 41:03.631
I could've just had
lunch with my parents.

41:03.647 --> 41:04.941
Yeah, that would've
been better.

41:04.956 --> 41:07.141
Next year --
grad-school parents' weekend.

41:07.155 --> 41:09.200
Hey, if it's okay with you,
you mind if we hang out

41:09.218 --> 41:11.412
- and watch you in action?
- Oh, I don't think you can hang out,

41:11.445 --> 41:13.181
- 'cause you're gonna be late --
- Late for...

41:13.218 --> 41:15.882
For your dinner reservations
at chez Zinjustin.

41:15.898 --> 41:17.792
I told grandma and grandpa
that I couldn't make it,

41:17.827 --> 41:20.503
but I accidentally told them
that you guys were free.

41:20.517 --> 41:22.173
- You're evil.
- You were mad.

41:22.186 --> 41:25.852
Isn't that a coincidence that they
had a reservation there, too?

41:25.865 --> 41:26.871
Oh, don't eat that doughnut,

41:26.907 --> 41:28.491
'cause I hear they have
a crème brûlée that is --

41:28.527 --> 41:29.373
Don't.

41:29.385 --> 41:31.493
Come on, get your lame-o-parent
selves out the door.

41:31.506 --> 41:32.893
You don't want to be late.
That'll tick them off.

41:32.928 --> 41:33.910
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

41:33.927 --> 41:35.321
Bye-bye.

41:37.337 --> 41:42.442
