00:45.292 --> 00:47.260
Imagine if we had
a million euros.

00:47.261 --> 00:49.596
What would you like to do?
Think of something.

00:49.597 --> 00:52.632
Pick anything at all.
What would you like to do?

00:52.633 --> 00:54.400
You've put me on the spot.

00:54.401 --> 00:55.435
Anything. Like, come on.

00:55.436 --> 00:57.837
I don't know.
Like, what's the budget?

00:57.838 --> 00:59.405
1 million.
I just said it.

00:59.406 --> 01:02.508
Do you want me to choose
an activity or an object?

01:02.509 --> 01:04.777
Whatever you wanna do,
just pick something!

01:04.778 --> 01:06.846
I don't know! Like, skydiving?

01:06.847 --> 01:07.847
Grand.

01:07.848 --> 01:09.315
Not a bad idea, go skydiving.

01:09.316 --> 01:13.253
I'll get you a plane and a parachute
and you can skydive whenever you want.

01:13.254 --> 01:15.555
Where'd you like to live?

01:15.556 --> 01:16.456
Mansion.

01:16.457 --> 01:18.858
Mansion, grand.
We living at City Hall?

01:18.859 --> 01:20.393
The Lord Mayor lives there,
like.

01:20.394 --> 01:22.428
Well, yeah, we won't actually
live IN the City Hall

01:22.429 --> 01:25.865
but we'll make a gaff just like
City Hall, know what I mean?

01:25.866 --> 01:28.368
And we put it... we put it there.

01:28.369 --> 01:29.802
Yeah, yeah, build our home
right here.

01:29.803 --> 01:31.838
- Looking over the city.
- Mansion looking over the city.

01:31.839 --> 01:34.307
- We'd need a butler or...
- Yeah, to clean the house.

01:34.308 --> 01:35.775
We'd get one of them
fellas like...

01:35.776 --> 01:37.744
- Batman?
- Yeah, he could run the gaff.

01:37.745 --> 01:39.979
With his English accent!
He'd be unbelievable.

01:39.980 --> 01:43.283
Imagine waking up
to that every morning.

01:43.284 --> 01:43.983
Yeah, right?

01:43.984 --> 01:46.486
"Alright? What's happening?"

01:46.487 --> 01:49.422
"Alright, alright?
What you want for breakfast?"

01:49.423 --> 01:52.625
"You want some tea, son?"

01:52.626 --> 01:55.828
So cool, right? We could have our
own cave as well, like the Batcave.

01:55.829 --> 01:57.964
- We'd call it the Boys Cave.
- The Boys Cave.

01:57.965 --> 02:00.300
We'd have pool tables,
pinball machines...

02:00.301 --> 02:02.001
- Lava lamps.
- Loads of lava lamps.

02:02.002 --> 02:04.337
- Big gold walls.
- Big gold walls.

02:04.338 --> 02:05.638
- Furry curtains.
- Furry curtains.

02:05.639 --> 02:08.608
Loads of girls with their
tits out lying across the couch.

02:08.609 --> 02:10.743
Like... like Spanish girls?

02:10.744 --> 02:11.811
Yeah, yeah! Spanish girls.

02:11.812 --> 02:15.982
We'd look like legends
wherever we went.

02:15.983 --> 02:17.617
Sounds amazing.

02:17.618 --> 02:21.487
<i>That handsome-looking fella
there is me, Conor MacSweeney.</i>

02:21.488 --> 02:23.790

<i>I live on the north side
of Cork city with me mam.</i>

02:38.806 --> 02:41.540
Fuck it.

02:41.642 --> 02:43.876
I was...

02:43.877 --> 02:45.478
..having a bad dream.

02:45.479 --> 02:47.447
No wonder you're always late.

02:47.448 --> 02:50.615
We're leaving in five minutes.

02:51.018 --> 02:53.285
Five minutes.

03:01.428 --> 03:03.596
And give me two
for the wife as well.

03:03.597 --> 03:06.466
- So four?
- Give me four.

03:06.467 --> 03:07.367
Alright, love?

03:07.368 --> 03:09.369

Conor, you fancy doing
a bit of work?

03:14.641 --> 03:19.144
What are you getting paid for?
Come on. For fuck's sake.

03:19.613 --> 03:21.814
<i>Jock is sort of...
self-employed.</i>

03:21.815 --> 03:24.951
<i>Let's just say if you leave

<i>it's your own fault.</i>

03:28.088 --> 03:30.857
<i>He's the kind of fella

<i>Like that time I bumped into
Billy Murphy...</i>

03:33.527 --> 03:34.727
Hi, how's it going?

03:34.728 --> 03:36.596
Give me your fuckin' phone!

03:36.597 --> 03:39.698
<i>..and he wanted to
borrow me phone.</i>

- St Pats.
- St Pats.

03:46.106 --> 03:50.609
Did you go to St Pats as well?
Didn't go to school?

<i>Jock found this great site
on the internet</i>

of anyone you want.</i>

03:56.683 --> 03:58.683
Alright, Billy?

04:02.556 --> 04:05.558
<i>He then went to nick the bike
from outside the Garda station</i>

04:05.559 --> 04:08.428
<i>which belonged to
Sergeant Healy.</i>

04:08.429 --> 04:11.097

..or you're going in the river!
Get the fuck off the bike.

04:19.540 --> 04:21.808
- Get your Micky off my back.
- Shut the fuck up.

04:21.809 --> 04:23.709
D'you understand the reason
for your arrest?

04:23.710 --> 04:25.711
- I do, yeah.
- Ya prick.

04:25.712 --> 04:27.613
<i>When the shades raided
Billy Murphy's gaff looking</i>

04:27.614 --> 04:31.818
<i>for Healy's bike, they ended up
finding hash plants instead.</i>

04:31.819 --> 04:34.819
<i>Shitloads of 'em.</i>

04:35.456 --> 04:37.623
<i>Turned into a bit of
a cat-and-mouse game</i>

04:37.624 --> 04:39.959
<i>between Healy and Jock
after that.</i>

04:39.960 --> 04:42.795
<i>I'm the only one who knows
it's him behind the mask.</i>

05:21.935 --> 05:23.401
Alright, but make it quick.

05:30.944 --> 05:34.046
- How do you cook these?
- How should I know?

05:34.047 --> 05:36.682
- You work here.
- I don't eat any of this shit.

05:36.683 --> 05:39.417
You serve in a fish shop
and you don't eat fish?

05:53.700 --> 05:55.601
- What do you eat?
- Chicken.

05:55.602 --> 05:57.103
Chicken. And nothing else?

06:32.072 --> 06:34.073
- Forget about it.
- Have a good day.

You could at least make
some kind of effort.

<i>So she tries to make up for it</i>

07:37.738 --> 07:41.073

riding that dopey-looking fella?

07:41.074 --> 07:42.642
Come on!

I know, but it's brilliant,

11:14.154 --> 11:15.921
If you're gonna mindlessly
mimic someone,

11:15.922 --> 11:19.724
could you at least pick someone
who's got half a fucking brain?

11:22.596 --> 11:23.896
Alright, mate?

11:23.897 --> 11:28.132

Just got hold of
100 smoke bombs.

12:10.410 --> 12:12.543

12:17.984 --> 12:21.086
<i>And this was the best one yet.</i>

12:21.087 --> 12:24.056
That means that one bale
is worth 7 million euros.

12:24.057 --> 12:25.391
- 7 million?!
- Each one, yeah!

12:25.392 --> 12:28.527
Do you know how many zeros
that is after 7 million?

12:28.528 --> 12:29.228
Hundreds!

12:29.229 --> 12:33.065

zeros! It's so much money!

When the forefathers
founded our country.

- Who were they?
- The forefathers.

12:43.710 --> 12:47.479
St Patrick, St Brigid...

12:47.480 --> 12:51.050
I dunno. Why are you asking me
these questions, like?

12:51.051 --> 12:51.984
Ask the teacher that.

12:51.985 --> 12:54.219
Basically, when our forefathers
founded this country, yeah,

12:54.220 --> 12:57.990
they made rules, like
if you're younger than 16,

12:57.991 --> 12:59.625
you're classified
as a young offender

12:59.626 --> 13:01.560
which basically means
you can't get in trouble.

13:01.561 --> 13:03.595
- So, we're just off the hook?
- For some reason,

13:03.596 --> 13:06.031
they thought our brains
weren't developed enough,

13:06.032 --> 13:08.434
that we wouldn't know
what we were doing or something.

13:08.435 --> 13:10.336
- I know, stupid, isn't it?
- Spastics!

13:10.337 --> 13:12.604
It's basically like
a get-out-of-jail-free card.

13:12.605 --> 13:14.406
I'm trying to find something
wrong with your plan.

13:14.407 --> 13:18.310
It's perfect. Think how easy
it'd be to find a bale as well.

13:18.311 --> 13:20.045
Think how good you are
at finding stuff.

13:20.046 --> 13:23.415
If I was looking for stuff...
stuff'll be found.

13:23.416 --> 13:26.251
This time tomorrow,
we could be millionaires, like.

13:26.252 --> 13:28.387
This is where we are, yeah?

13:28.388 --> 13:30.289
That's you, that's me.

13:30.290 --> 13:31.757
And this is where the cocaine
went overboard.

13:31.758 --> 13:34.126
Jeez, boy,
that's fucking miles away!

13:34.127 --> 13:35.527
No, it's not, it's like that.

13:35.528 --> 13:38.130
You do know it's not
actually that far, like.

13:38.131 --> 13:40.132
I know that.
I know how maps work.

13:40.133 --> 13:41.367
I'll nick us a couple of bikes,

13:41.368 --> 13:44.235
we leave first thing
in the morning.

13:44.537 --> 13:46.171
Can we go the day after?

13:46.172 --> 13:47.573
No, it has to be tomorrow.

13:47.574 --> 13:49.475
The guards'll have it found
if we leave any later.

13:49.476 --> 13:52.778
I have to cover Mam in the shop.
She's getting her tooth pulled.

13:52.779 --> 13:54.213
You're actually telling me that

13:54.214 --> 13:55.280
you're not gonna go get
7 million euros

13:55.281 --> 13:58.050
'cause you're gonna work
in the fish shop for the day?

13:58.051 --> 14:00.352
You could have everything
you ever wanted.

14:00.353 --> 14:02.721
Mansions, cars, caves and tits.

14:02.722 --> 14:04.790
I know, right,
but I promised her.

14:04.791 --> 14:06.091
What excuse am I meant to give?

14:06.092 --> 14:08.260
"Me and Jock are heading
down to West Cork"

14:08.261 --> 14:09.228
"to find a bale of cocaine."

14:09.229 --> 14:11.630
She thinks I'm stupid enough
as it is.

14:11.631 --> 14:15.634
Boy, this is far more important
than your mam's gammy tooth.

14:15.635 --> 14:18.404
This is monumental.

14:18.405 --> 14:20.472
This could be
the difference between

14:20.473 --> 14:22.775
us having an amazing life

14:22.776 --> 14:26.877
or us having a really shit one.

14:27.747 --> 14:29.681
I'm going either way.

14:29.682 --> 14:34.452
If you wanna come, meet me at
the docks at six in the morning.

14:49.669 --> 14:51.170
<i>Did you ever get</i>

14:51.171 --> 14:52.571
<i>an annoying splinter
in your finger?</i>

14:52.572 --> 14:54.706
<i>The more you try and get it
out, the deeper it gets?</i>

14:54.707 --> 14:58.343
<i>Well, Healy's the kind of guy
who'll cut off his own finger</i>

14:58.344 --> 15:00.412
<i>just to teach
that splinter a lesson.</i>

15:00.413 --> 15:01.380
Unlocked bikes, trackers.

15:01.381 --> 15:04.483
D'you know how much shit
we're getting because of this?

15:04.484 --> 15:05.350
Stealing is stealing.

15:05.351 --> 15:07.252
They're using trackers
on bikes in London.

15:07.253 --> 15:08.854
We're London Met now, are we?

15:08.855 --> 15:10.456
Did you forget you're in Cork?

15:10.457 --> 15:12.758
I took you off bike duty
three months ago.

15:12.759 --> 15:14.159
Yeah, but Fake Billy

15:14.160 --> 15:16.462
is still on the rampage
and it's only gonna get worse.

15:16.463 --> 15:20.532
Starts off with a bike,
then a car, then a bus.

15:20.533 --> 15:22.534
You gotta stop 'em
when they're young.

15:22.535 --> 15:23.735
If that was the train
of thought, boy,

15:23.736 --> 15:27.239
the thing after that would be
a tank, then a jumbo jet.

15:27.240 --> 15:29.573
Now you see what
I'm talking about.

15:31.411 --> 15:34.213
You think I give a shit
about Fake Billy stealing bikes?

15:34.214 --> 15:36.648
Don't look like you give a shit
about anything except chocolate.

15:36.649 --> 15:39.852
Be very fucking careful now,
kid. Very careful.

15:39.853 --> 15:42.855
What's worrying me at the moment
is I've cells for a bike thief

15:42.856 --> 15:46.558
you put in there, and murder's
on a waiting list to get in.

15:46.559 --> 15:48.527
Enough with
the fucking bicycles.

15:48.528 --> 15:51.396
You're a bit of a loner, Healy.
It's not healthy.

15:51.397 --> 15:54.566
Do you want me to ask the lads
to take you out for drinks?

15:54.567 --> 15:57.935
Maybe hook you up with somebody?
Would you like that?

16:04.177 --> 16:08.647
<i>If you wanna catch a big
fish, you gotta drop a big hook</i>

16:08.648 --> 16:11.749
<i>right where he likes to feed.</i>

16:20.326 --> 16:22.394
<i>Mam cooks like she hates food.</i>

16:22.395 --> 16:25.397
<i>And the person
she's cooking it for.</i>

16:25.398 --> 16:27.798
What's wrong with ya?

16:28.268 --> 16:29.935
Did you have this for dinner?

16:29.936 --> 16:33.003
- Yeah, why?
- You enjoyed it?

16:33.640 --> 16:34.439
It's dry, like.

16:34.440 --> 16:39.610
Well, put some ketchup on it.
Jesus Christ.

16:40.647 --> 16:43.282
Aren't you lucky I'm here
to cook your dry Kiev.

16:43.283 --> 16:45.417
What would you do
if I wasn't around?

16:45.418 --> 16:47.286
Wouldn't even know
how a microwave works.

16:47.287 --> 16:50.923
- Eat takeaway.
- How you gonna pay for that?

16:50.924 --> 16:52.457
Get a job.

16:52.458 --> 16:53.792
Are you taking the piss?

16:53.793 --> 16:55.494
Last I heard you were thinking
of quitting school.

16:55.495 --> 16:59.130
- Yeah, I am quitting school.
- Yeah. 'Cause Jock is, is he?

17:00.700 --> 17:02.935
Who's gonna hire you
without a leaving cert?

17:02.936 --> 17:08.272
Dunno, like. Work on a trade
or be a builder or something.

17:08.273 --> 17:10.342
Yeah.
Like your old man, is it?

17:10.343 --> 17:11.609
That turned out well, didn't it?

17:11.611 --> 17:13.612
- Fuck's sake.
- Hang on, Mam.

17:13.613 --> 17:15.948
No-one's gonna give you a job.
Only me.

17:15.949 --> 17:20.984
I'm even thinking of firing you,
you're so fucking useless.

17:22.989 --> 17:27.291
- Hey, clear that up.
- Fuck off!

17:27.292 --> 17:28.560
Fuck's sake.

17:28.560 --> 17:32.563
<i>And that's how
most of our meals end.</i>

17:55.655 --> 17:58.590
<i>There are two things
you need for a good adventure -</i>

17:58.591 --> 18:02.327
<i>a treasure map and someone
dumb enough to go with ya.</i>

18:02.328 --> 18:05.796
- Oi, kid!
<i>- Now Jock had both.</i>

18:05.798 --> 18:08.734
- Didn't think you'd come.
- Fucking course I'd come.

18:08.735 --> 18:11.336
Thanks, boy.
Take a look around you.

18:11.337 --> 18:13.338
When we get back,
this is gonna be ours.

18:13.339 --> 18:15.274
- We own this place.
- 7 million euros.

18:15.275 --> 18:17.843
- 7 million euros.
- What are we gonna do with it?

18:17.844 --> 18:19.678
- Like, invest it in stuff.
- Invest the money?

18:19.679 --> 18:22.848
- In a business or something.
- We won't think about that now.

18:22.849 --> 18:24.816
Close your eyes. Got a surprise.

18:24.817 --> 18:26.418
Alright.

18:26.419 --> 18:28.453
What is it, Jock?

18:28.454 --> 18:30.554
One second.

18:34.360 --> 18:36.760
OK, open 'em.

18:37.397 --> 18:40.197
Lethal, isn't it?

18:40.366 --> 18:41.933
That's a girl's bike.

18:41.934 --> 18:43.802
No, it's not. It's a cruiser.

18:43.803 --> 18:45.871
It's a cruiser
with flowers on it.

18:45.872 --> 18:47.005
<i>Jock could convince you</i>

18:47.006 --> 18:49.675
<i>that his shit tasted beautiful
if he wanted to.</i>

18:49.676 --> 18:52.444
I was around town for ages
looking for the perfect bike.

18:52.445 --> 18:53.979
You ring that and I come to you.

18:53.980 --> 18:56.315
It's got the fanny dip thing.
I don't want that.

18:56.316 --> 18:57.849
Fanny dip thing, boy.
It's got three gears.

18:57.850 --> 19:00.719
I thought I'd give this to you.
You don't have bike miles.

19:00.720 --> 19:03.388
Jesus. Talk about
lack of appreciation.

19:03.389 --> 19:05.791
I do appreciate it, boy.
No, seriously.

19:05.792 --> 19:06.692
Fair play to ya.

19:06.693 --> 19:08.493
Seriously,
I didn't realise it was good.

19:08.494 --> 19:09.761
I was just judging it
by its colour.

19:09.762 --> 19:15.199
- Did you get the same bike?
- Nah, slightly different.

19:19.639 --> 19:20.972
It's slightly different alright.

19:20.973 --> 19:24.376
Listen to this.
Wasn't even locked.

19:24.377 --> 19:26.677
Dickhead.

19:35.121 --> 19:36.688
<i>As we headed out of the city,</i>

19:36.689 --> 19:40.692
<i>we both knew that
we were never coming back.</i>

19:40.693 --> 19:42.494
<i>Well, emotionally that is,
anyway.</i>

19:42.495 --> 19:44.930
<i>We were gonna change, you know?
Grow up.</i>

19:44.931 --> 19:46.832
<i>Learn how to be men.</i>

19:46.833 --> 19:48.734
That's a good strong bridge.

19:48.735 --> 19:51.602
<i>And stop doing childish things.</i>

19:58.745 --> 20:00.011
<i>Imagine it.</i>

20:00.012 --> 20:02.914
<i>61 bales of cocaine
washing up on the shore.</i>

20:02.915 --> 20:05.384
<i>All we had to do
was find one of them.</i>

20:05.385 --> 20:06.585
<i>Nothin' was gonna stop us.</i>

20:06.586 --> 20:11.089
My boys are killing me. I don't
think I can go any further.

20:11.090 --> 20:12.557
Yeah, we're only in Bandon.

20:12.558 --> 20:14.760
Not even 20 miles
outside the city, like.

20:14.761 --> 20:16.628
Here, I got you this
to cool you down.

20:16.629 --> 20:18.930
<i>When an icepack is unavailable,</i>

20:18.931 --> 20:21.699
<i>you gotta improvise.</i>

20:24.504 --> 20:28.473
Jesus, boy.
That's gonna be sticky.

20:28.474 --> 20:29.574
I don't care.

20:29.575 --> 20:32.511
That's nice now.
That's all that matters.

20:32.512 --> 20:33.645
Stop, stop.

20:33.646 --> 20:36.448
- Stop. Stop. Stop.
- What's wrong with ya?

20:36.449 --> 20:38.884
God, my balls are sticking
to the inside of my leg.

20:38.885 --> 20:42.120
- Didn't I warn ya?
- How much further do we have?

20:42.121 --> 20:44.923
- About 50 miles. Yes!
- Are you serious?

20:44.924 --> 20:46.491
I can't pedal like this
for 50 miles.

20:46.492 --> 20:49.628
What are you getting angry at me
for, boy? It's your own fault.

20:49.629 --> 20:52.764
I need to wash me plums off,
boy. Can we go for a swim?

20:52.765 --> 20:54.533
Grand, alright.
We're literally in.

20:54.534 --> 20:58.802
- Wash our balls, and we're gone.
- Alright.

21:02.875 --> 21:05.109
Conor.

21:06.179 --> 21:08.046
You busy?

21:08.047 --> 21:10.048
I brought you some tea.

21:10.049 --> 21:13.050
Sorry about last night.

21:14.120 --> 21:16.854
Conor?

21:24.664 --> 21:27.097
Conor?

21:38.778 --> 21:41.513
Here, these jocks
are fucking terrible, boy.

21:41.514 --> 21:43.148
They strangle my balls.

21:43.149 --> 21:45.717
It's Mam.

21:45.718 --> 21:46.852
You gonna answer it?

21:46.853 --> 21:49.621
Have her call me a fucking
moron?

21:49.622 --> 21:52.224
- No, thanks.
- Conor, you fucking moron.

21:52.225 --> 21:54.958
Where are ya? You promised me.

21:56.128 --> 21:59.129
Call me back straightaway.

22:03.769 --> 22:05.504
It's definitely deep enough.

22:05.505 --> 22:08.874
- How d'you know?
- You can just tell.

22:08.875 --> 22:11.276
But, like, I can see
the rocks, like.

22:11.277 --> 22:15.714
Nah. Perspective is different
when water is on it.

22:15.715 --> 22:18.283
The rocks are actually,
like, really far down.

22:18.284 --> 22:20.519
Magnifies things, water does.

22:20.520 --> 22:23.655
- OK, well...
- You go first, alright.

22:23.656 --> 22:25.624
Can you swim, though?

22:25.625 --> 22:26.525
Yeah.

22:26.526 --> 22:29.594
I can swim, and I can swim
pretty well, boy.

22:29.595 --> 22:31.830
- You can't swim at all.
- Who told you that?

22:31.831 --> 22:33.164
It's going all over
the place, like.

22:33.165 --> 22:36.034
"It's going all over the place?"
Everyone is saying I can't swim?

22:36.035 --> 22:39.237
- Well, pretty much, yeah.
- That's bullshit, like.

22:39.238 --> 22:42.073
Do you not know what people
call you in school?

22:42.074 --> 22:43.275
- What?
- 'Finding Nemo'.

22:43.276 --> 22:45.677
'Cause he's got
that fucking gammy fin, like.

22:45.678 --> 22:47.245
They don't call me
'Finding Nemo'.

22:47.246 --> 22:51.983
They call you Nemo. Like,
'Finding Nemo's the title.

22:51.984 --> 22:54.953
- Fuck off. Do they actually?
- A little bit, like.

22:54.954 --> 22:57.122
All I'm saying is if we go down
by the steps,

22:57.123 --> 22:59.591
you can have a nice little
paddle, do your own thing.

22:59.592 --> 23:01.059
No, we're not going
in the fucking steps.

23:01.060 --> 23:06.797
The old man's gonna think we're
fucking pussies. Look at him.

23:06.933 --> 23:08.633
We need to jump in from here.

23:08.634 --> 23:11.069
Alright, if we're gonna
jump in, though,

23:11.070 --> 23:13.138
we better do it together.

23:13.139 --> 23:15.040
- OK?
- Together?

23:15.041 --> 23:16.641
Yeah.

23:16.642 --> 23:17.876
Fuck it. Alright.

23:17.877 --> 23:20.410
- So, on three.
- Alright.

23:27.353 --> 23:29.820
You ready?

23:30.089 --> 23:34.992
One... two... three.

23:42.168 --> 23:45.604
Hey! There's only 2ft of water.

23:45.605 --> 23:48.206
You'll break your legs
if you jump in there.

23:48.207 --> 23:51.042
In God's name.

23:51.043 --> 23:53.979
<i>Crime is sort of similar
to going for a swim in the sea.</i>

23:53.980 --> 23:56.848
<i>First you dip your toe in
and it's a bit cold,</i>

23:56.849 --> 23:59.718
<i>but before long you're in
up to your balls and...</i>

23:59.719 --> 24:03.220
- It's actually really warm.
- So warm.

24:03.656 --> 24:06.324
That's it, boy. Come on.!

24:06.325 --> 24:11.228
- It's been a while since I swam.
- OK, just kick your feet.

24:11.764 --> 24:14.766
<i>Jock was always
the one teaching me things.</i>

24:14.767 --> 24:17.302
- Fuck off!
<i>- How to smoke cigarettes.</i>

24:17.303 --> 24:20.938
<i>How to shotgun a can of beer.</i>

24:21.374 --> 24:23.908
<i>How to pick a lock.
It was nice</i>

24:23.909 --> 24:26.244
<i>to be able to teach him
something for a change.</i>

24:26.245 --> 24:27.846
That's it, boy! You got it!

24:27.847 --> 24:30.649
- I'm like a seal.
- Like a seal.

24:30.650 --> 24:33.218
And I'm like a whale.!

24:33.219 --> 24:36.854
Argh!

24:50.236 --> 24:52.103
Should we go back in?

24:52.104 --> 24:55.072
Yeah, come on.!

24:58.911 --> 25:00.445
- What's the matter with you?
- It's Conor.

25:00.446 --> 25:03.348
He's gone missing right when
I need to go to the dentist.

25:03.349 --> 25:05.016
- You alright?
- Aye, typical shit with him.

25:05.017 --> 25:07.886
I had a fight and he's gone.
He's just, you know...

25:07.887 --> 25:10.221
What were you fighting about?

25:10.222 --> 25:14.658
Do I ask you what you're doing
with all the fish heads?

25:16.762 --> 25:17.462
- No.
- No.

25:17.463 --> 25:20.799
'Cause it's none
of my business, is it?

25:20.800 --> 25:21.966
No.

25:21.967 --> 25:24.269
<i>I learnt everything I know</i>

25:24.270 --> 25:26.471
<i>about customer service
from me mam.</i>

25:26.472 --> 25:32.509
Sorry. Here, look.
Have another fish head.

25:32.712 --> 25:35.413
- A salmon one.
- It's on the house.

25:35.414 --> 25:38.950
- Thanks very much.
- Alright. Go on.

25:38.951 --> 25:41.652
Alright.

25:57.336 --> 26:00.171
Why do you have
a little girl's bike?

26:00.172 --> 26:00.939
Why do I what?

26:00.940 --> 26:04.275
Why do you have a little girl's
bike with flowers and stuff?

26:04.276 --> 26:07.278
I thought you said
it was a cruiser.

26:07.279 --> 26:08.947
It is a cruiser.

26:08.948 --> 26:10.949
A girl's cruiser.

26:10.950 --> 26:13.818
You're such a liar.

26:13.819 --> 26:16.420
Fuck's sake.

26:23.496 --> 26:26.264
<i>Ignorance really is bliss.</i>

26:26.265 --> 26:30.534
<i>And right then,
we had shitloads of it.</i>

26:56.195 --> 26:59.264
Can you see that bike
up there as well?

26:59.265 --> 27:01.266
- Top of the hill?
- Yeah.

27:01.267 --> 27:03.434
It's been behind us
for the last half-hour.

27:03.435 --> 27:05.103
Now it's starting to get closer.

27:05.104 --> 27:08.072
- What are you talking about?
- Just a bit paranoid, you know?

27:08.073 --> 27:11.509
Mind if we take the scenic route
for the next while?

27:11.510 --> 27:13.443
Yeah, sure.

27:32.464 --> 27:33.998
Bollocks! He's there again!

27:33.999 --> 27:36.467
- Who do you think it is?
- I don't know.

27:36.468 --> 27:37.936
He's too far away. I can't see.

27:37.937 --> 27:41.039
It's probably just someone
going for a bike ride, like.

27:41.040 --> 27:43.441
A fast bike ride,
in our direction.

27:43.442 --> 27:45.410
Look, let's not take
any chances, alright?

27:45.411 --> 27:48.145
Time for you to use
your tall gear.

28:02.995 --> 28:06.331
- Hold up, hold up, hold up.
- What are you doing?

28:06.332 --> 28:08.166
Jock?

28:08.167 --> 28:10.969
Keep sketch, keep sketch.

28:10.970 --> 28:14.638
Just hurry up.
We're losing time.

28:17.543 --> 28:20.478
Jock... Jock, don't, boy!

28:20.479 --> 28:22.313
There's a kid's toy in the back.

28:22.314 --> 28:26.117
I don't wanna do it either,
but what choice do I have?

28:26.118 --> 28:27.285
We could NOT do it.

28:27.286 --> 28:30.121
If it doesn't break first time,
it wasn't meant to be

28:30.122 --> 28:33.256
and I won't
do it again, alright?

28:34.126 --> 28:36.860
OK, go on.

28:37.196 --> 28:42.232
It was meant to be.

28:44.036 --> 28:45.702
Sketch, sketch!

28:58.984 --> 29:02.452
Fuckin' prick.

29:04.323 --> 29:07.157
Here. Have a look.

29:15.634 --> 29:18.201
Fuckin' prick.

29:19.571 --> 29:25.709
So what are we gonna do, Jock?
He's ruining our holiday.

29:27.646 --> 29:30.014
I'm gonna talk to him.

29:30.015 --> 29:31.049
What?

29:31.050 --> 29:32.350
I saw 'Heat' the other day.

29:32.351 --> 29:35.586
You know that film with
Robert De Niro and Al Pacino?

29:35.587 --> 29:37.088
I can't say I do, no.

29:37.089 --> 29:39.057
Action movie,
full of explosions, guns.

29:39.058 --> 29:40.591
Class.
Do you have it on DVD?

29:40.592 --> 29:42.660
No, video. Wait.
It doesn't fuckin' matter.

29:42.661 --> 29:45.263
De Niro's the criminal
and Al Pacino's the cop.

29:45.264 --> 29:47.432
Al Pacino spends the whole time
trying to get De Niro

29:47.433 --> 29:49.500
'cause De Niro's unbelievable,
he can't get him.

29:49.501 --> 29:51.436
- Like, cat and mouse?
- Yeah, exactly like that.

29:51.437 --> 29:53.738
There's a scene
where they meet in a cafe

29:53.739 --> 29:55.139
and set down some ground rules.

29:55.140 --> 29:57.508
If I can go in there
and just talk to him,

29:57.509 --> 30:01.579
like fuckin' De Niro and
Al Pacino does, like man to man,

30:01.580 --> 30:05.116
maybe I can fuckin' say,
"Here, look. Give us a break."

30:05.117 --> 30:08.720
"When we get back, we'll pick
it up and it'll be more fun."

30:08.721 --> 30:10.755
You can't just walk in
and be like,

30:10.756 --> 30:13.057
"Wanna have your head
smacked down, boy?"

30:13.058 --> 30:14.993
I'll go up to the table and...

30:14.994 --> 30:16.995
No, don't go up. Go down.

30:16.996 --> 30:18.296
- Down?
- Like that.

30:18.297 --> 30:21.599
"How's it going?"
"How's it going?"

30:21.600 --> 30:23.468
- That's good.
- "How's it going?"

30:23.469 --> 30:24.635
"Thought we should
have a little chat."

30:24.636 --> 30:27.705
"Thought it'd be good to have
a little chat. How's it going?"

30:27.706 --> 30:29.474
- Yeah, "How's it going?"
- "How's it going?"

30:29.475 --> 30:31.609
"Thought it'd be good
to have a little chat."

30:31.610 --> 30:33.478
Kinda like,
"I'm not scared of you.

30:33.479 --> 30:34.545
- "But I respect you."
- Yeah, see?

30:34.546 --> 30:38.483
"How's it going? Thought it'd
be good to have a little chat."

30:38.484 --> 30:41.351
- Yeah.
- Alright.

30:46.658 --> 30:50.293
I suppose you do look
a bit like De Niro.

31:21.093 --> 31:22.293
How's it going?

31:22.294 --> 31:25.895
Fuckin'... I told him
to nod down, not up.

31:26.732 --> 31:31.534
Thought it'd be good for us
to have a little chat.

31:33.338 --> 31:34.639
No, no!

31:34.640 --> 31:38.109
- He's wanted by the guards.
- Fuck's sake!

31:38.110 --> 31:40.244
I just wanted a chat!
That's all!

31:40.245 --> 31:41.345
My gosh!

31:41.346 --> 31:44.649
Any chance we could discuss some
ground rules for this chase?

31:44.650 --> 31:46.350
- What?
- I don't know.

31:46.351 --> 31:47.585
You could give me a head start.

31:47.586 --> 31:49.487
I'm gonna catch you
and lock you up

31:49.488 --> 31:51.322
where you belong,
you thieving knacker!

31:51.323 --> 31:55.725
- Watch who you callin' knacker.
- Knacker!

32:18.584 --> 32:20.485
Fuck!

32:20.486 --> 32:23.187
Shouldn't you be spending your
time chasing real criminals?

32:23.188 --> 32:24.889
You are a real criminal,
you fuckin' moron!

32:24.890 --> 32:27.258
Not I'm not!
I'm just having a bit of fun.

32:27.259 --> 32:30.795
Fun? You're nothing but a
thieving little fuckin' knacker!

32:30.796 --> 32:33.397
Yeah, well, chasing me
is your whole life, boy,

32:33.398 --> 32:36.700
and that's pretty fuckin' sad.

32:37.236 --> 32:39.969
You little fuckin' prick!

32:45.344 --> 32:46.210
What happened?

32:46.211 --> 32:50.715
I don't think he's seen
that movie 'Heat', boy.

32:50.716 --> 32:51.916
<i>It was around about then</i>

32:51.917 --> 32:54.452
<i>when I started to miss
working in the fish shop.</i>

32:54.453 --> 32:57.188
There, sir, there you go.
And your change.

32:57.189 --> 32:58.789
Lovely. Thank you very much.

32:58.790 --> 33:01.826
<i>Sure, I had to put up with
Mam giving me shit all day,</i>

33:01.827 --> 33:05.930
<i>but there are a lot of benefits
to a steady job, like...</i>

33:05.931 --> 33:07.698
<i>..not getting chased
by a crazy cop.</i>

33:07.699 --> 33:10.668
Is that your phone?

33:10.669 --> 33:11.602
Yeah.

33:11.603 --> 33:13.871
I bet that's how
he keeps finding us.

33:13.872 --> 33:16.473
Come on. Get rid of it.

33:30.489 --> 33:32.557
There's this fuckin' weirdo
trying to chase us.

33:32.558 --> 33:34.926
Can we hide in your gaff?
That be alright?

33:34.927 --> 33:37.494
Sorry! Thank you!

33:42.501 --> 33:45.336
My name is Detective Tony Healy.
I'm with the guards.

33:45.337 --> 33:47.972
Two lads coming through here,
where did they go?

33:47.973 --> 33:51.574
- Fuck this, man.
- No! Wait, wait!

33:52.844 --> 33:55.913
Must have been
a different driveway.

33:55.914 --> 33:59.649
No-one came through here.

34:02.454 --> 34:07.725
Look, I can see the tracks
leading right up to the door.

34:07.726 --> 34:11.429
- I know they're inside.
- They're from my wheelchair.

34:11.429 --> 34:12.730
- You use a wheelchair?
- Sometimes.

34:12.731 --> 34:17.801
When I'm feelin' lazy. Great
for getting around the farm.

34:18.603 --> 34:21.239
Look, I know you're lying to me.

34:21.239 --> 34:23.741
And what are you
gonna do about it?

34:23.742 --> 34:24.775
Radio for backup?

34:24.775 --> 34:26.744
Those two little thieving pricks
you've got inside,

34:26.745 --> 34:29.746
they're gonna rob you blind,
and you know what?

34:29.748 --> 34:31.815
I hope they do.
Might teach you a lesson.

34:31.817 --> 34:36.853
I have nothin' worth stealing,
but thanks for the concern.

34:36.855 --> 34:39.222
Now fuck off.

34:47.966 --> 34:50.800
Fuckin' hell, mate.

34:53.338 --> 34:54.472
What's he doing?

34:54.473 --> 34:56.407
He's just standing there,
looking at us.

34:56.408 --> 35:00.743
Bet he can go days
without food or water.

35:14.459 --> 35:16.861
Nice of you to drop by.

35:16.862 --> 35:20.063
It's been a while.

35:20.966 --> 35:23.334
Do you know him?

35:23.335 --> 35:24.802
No.

35:24.803 --> 35:26.937
You boys hungry?

35:26.938 --> 35:28.939
I'm starving.

35:28.940 --> 35:32.809
I'm thinking
of cooking a chicken.

35:32.878 --> 35:34.478
I fuckin' love chicken.

35:34.479 --> 35:41.651
Good. Go out back and kill
whichever one takes your fancy.

35:43.622 --> 35:44.789
Kill?

35:44.790 --> 35:48.492
Get him, get him, get him!

35:48.493 --> 35:51.661
Aye! Jesus!

35:54.800 --> 35:56.534
Fuck!

35:56.535 --> 35:58.869
God!

35:58.870 --> 36:02.572
Hey-hey! Whoo-hoo!

36:15.821 --> 36:17.955
Go on. Do it.

36:17.956 --> 36:19.490
I can't.

36:19.491 --> 36:20.925
It's looking right at me.

36:20.926 --> 36:23.594
It's just a chicken.
Stop being a wuss.

36:23.595 --> 36:26.497
It reminds me
a little bit of me.

36:26.498 --> 36:27.898
What? How?

36:27.899 --> 36:30.868
The way it's staring.

36:30.869 --> 36:33.971
You know, sort of
a confused look, like...

36:33.972 --> 36:37.742
..like it doesn't really know
what's going on half the time.

36:37.743 --> 36:40.678
He's not dyin'!

36:40.679 --> 36:43.447
- He's too strong.
- You need to pull it hard, like.

36:43.448 --> 36:45.416
Then he'll start
bleeding out the front.

36:45.417 --> 36:47.952
No, he won't.
Just pull his neck.

36:47.953 --> 36:50.019
One, two, three.

36:51.757 --> 36:53.090
- He's dead?
- He's dead.

36:53.091 --> 36:55.526
- He's dead. Alright.
- Put him in the bucket.

36:55.527 --> 36:59.862
Put him in the bucket.
That's it.

37:02.667 --> 37:05.335
He's still alive, boy.

37:10.609 --> 37:14.645
What if you hold his neck
and I pull his body backwards?

37:14.646 --> 37:17.313
That sounds fair.

37:21.052 --> 37:25.655
As soon as his legs
stop kicking, pluck him.

37:33.899 --> 37:37.834
He did say "pluck him", right?

37:39.538 --> 37:42.740
<i>When you live in the city,
you don't see many animals die.</i>

37:42.741 --> 37:46.643
<i>They're all dead
when they get there.</i>

37:47.446 --> 37:49.480
<i>It didn't seem
to bother Jock much.</i>

37:49.481 --> 37:53.082
<i>He had other things on his mind.</i>

38:03.195 --> 38:06.230
<i>You know, when you've only got
one thing on your mind,</i>

38:06.231 --> 38:08.899
<i>it can be kind of hard
to think clearly.</i>

38:08.900 --> 38:11.034
<i>You can get tunnel vision.</i>

38:11.870 --> 38:16.540
<i>But if you stop
and open your eyes</i>

38:16.541 --> 38:18.975
<i>just for a moment...</i>

38:23.682 --> 38:28.017
<i>..you'd be amazed
at what you might see.</i>

38:28.119 --> 38:31.054
The hell is that?

38:31.223 --> 38:34.057
Look at that.

38:48.273 --> 38:50.741
What is it?

38:50.742 --> 38:54.177
And you made me
throw away my phone.

38:55.547 --> 38:56.814
GPS?

38:56.815 --> 38:59.982
I knew he had to be cheating!

39:00.619 --> 39:02.286
I've got an idea.

39:02.287 --> 39:06.889
<i>That was rare enough for me
so I was delighted with meself.</i>

39:40.225 --> 39:43.426
The chicken is lovely,
isn't it, Conor?

39:52.938 --> 39:56.607
It's alright. Leave it,
leave it. It's alright.

39:56.608 --> 39:59.310
Hey, thanks
for helping us there earlier.

39:59.311 --> 40:00.611
Yeah.

40:00.612 --> 40:01.879
Yeah, nice that you let us in.

40:01.880 --> 40:05.114
Could've been some other
cranky fucker, you know?

40:05.650 --> 40:08.117
What are you staring at?

40:09.588 --> 40:10.854
I'm not staring.

40:10.855 --> 40:12.656
You're staring straight at me!

40:12.657 --> 40:14.825
I'm not staring.
I'm just looking at you.

40:14.826 --> 40:16.894
I'm having
a conversation with you.

40:16.895 --> 40:20.898
Fucking hell, it'd be weird
if we didn't, like.

40:20.899 --> 40:23.334
Do you think this is funny?

40:23.335 --> 40:25.669
No, it's... No, sir.

40:25.670 --> 40:26.837
Dopey little prick.

40:26.838 --> 40:29.607
- Don't call him a dope.
- Don't you shout at me!

40:29.608 --> 40:32.276
I'm not fuckin' shouting.
I said don't call him a dope!

40:32.277 --> 40:37.314
Every time you come down here,
it is the same fuckin' shit.

40:37.315 --> 40:38.682
We've never been here before.

40:38.683 --> 40:41.986
I paid for everything.
I put you two through college.

40:41.987 --> 40:45.155
We're 15! I didn't even
pass me junior cert.

40:45.156 --> 40:47.725
- Who do you think we are?
- For fuck's...

40:47.726 --> 40:49.126
You've had enough
of that now, alright?

40:49.127 --> 40:52.162
Fuck you, I've had enough!
This is my fuckin' house.

40:52.163 --> 40:55.366
- I'll drink whatever I like.
- Sit down and eat your dinner.

40:55.367 --> 40:57.267
That's my fuckin' whiskey.
Give it to me.

40:57.268 --> 41:00.170
- Get off me!
- Give me that fuckin' bottle!

41:00.171 --> 41:02.471
Get away from us!

41:02.941 --> 41:03.941
Stay back there.

41:03.942 --> 41:05.943
Get out of the way,
you little prick.

41:05.944 --> 41:07.745
- Alright, stop, stop!
- What?

41:07.746 --> 41:10.114
- What are you saying?
- Relax, alright, boy?

41:10.115 --> 41:12.082
OK, I'm gonna put the chair down

41:12.083 --> 41:14.918
and we're gonna talk, alright?

41:14.919 --> 41:17.154
Alright.

41:17.155 --> 41:18.989
Stay back.

41:18.990 --> 41:21.325
Fuckin' hell!
Don't touch it, ya cunt!

41:21.326 --> 41:23.227
<i>I went through
all the options in me head</i>

41:23.228 --> 41:27.063
<i>and there was only
one logical thing for us to do.</i>

41:29.000 --> 41:30.834
Relax! Relax!

41:30.835 --> 41:32.970
No, no!

41:32.971 --> 41:34.371
I'm here! Look!

41:34.372 --> 41:37.207
Look. Stop. Stop.

41:37.208 --> 41:39.043
Isn't this a nice comfy chair?

41:39.044 --> 41:41.679
- Do you like this? Yeah?
- Yeah.

41:41.680 --> 41:43.747
You've just gotta talk
to him and he's grand.

41:43.748 --> 41:46.717
- Give me the bottle.
- You can't have that, alright?

41:46.718 --> 41:49.820
We'll give you something later,
like a beer or something.

41:49.821 --> 41:53.791
- Alright, alright.
- See? He wants a beer, boy.

41:53.792 --> 41:56.092
Yeah.

41:57.328 --> 42:00.330
<i>That night sitting around
watching telly</i>

42:00.331 --> 42:01.799
<i>was the closest we had all got</i>

42:01.800 --> 42:04.768
<i>to a normal night in
for a long, long time.</i>

42:04.769 --> 42:07.036
Yeah, that show is very good.

42:11.910 --> 42:13.844
<i>I think sometimes
people do the opposite</i>

42:13.845 --> 42:17.014
<i>of what they should do
when they're lonely.</i>

42:17.015 --> 42:18.882
<i>The hide away at work,</i>

42:18.883 --> 42:22.052
<i>fight with the people
they miss most,</i>

42:22.053 --> 42:23.954
<i>and they turn to the bottle</i>

42:23.955 --> 42:28.157
<i>instead of pickin' up the phone.</i>

42:47.412 --> 42:50.180
<i>Imagine you've been
out all night,</i>

42:50.181 --> 42:53.083
<i>no sleep, no food.</i>

42:53.084 --> 42:55.886
<i>You're in the same wet clothes.</i>

42:55.887 --> 42:58.122
<i>Same stupid face.</i>

42:58.123 --> 43:00.423
Fuck...

43:01.493 --> 43:07.164
<i>You stuck in there
in spite of everything.</i>

43:07.165 --> 43:08.432
<i>At least when it's all over,</i>

43:08.433 --> 43:12.035
<i>you can take pleasure in
knowing it was all worthwhile.</i>

43:12.036 --> 43:17.073
No, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no...

43:21.312 --> 43:22.012
FUC...!

43:22.013 --> 43:24.448
Our treasure's waiting
for us around this corner,

43:24.449 --> 43:27.317
but there's gonna be loads
of guards, drug squad,

43:27.318 --> 43:29.520
special forces, helicopters,

43:29.521 --> 43:31.522
probably even the army.

43:31.523 --> 43:33.123
Should we use fake names?

43:33.124 --> 43:35.159
Would you stop
with the fake names?

43:35.160 --> 43:39.062
Look, if anyone asks,
just say we're on holidays.

43:39.063 --> 43:42.732
- Got it?
- Yeah, got it.

43:49.841 --> 43:54.443
Nah, this... this
can't be the place.

44:06.024 --> 44:08.992
Here, sorry.
Is this Three Castle Head?

44:08.993 --> 44:13.430
- Yeah.
- We're just on our holidays.

44:13.431 --> 44:15.365
You should've seen
the place yesterday.

44:15.366 --> 44:17.501
You heard about
the cocaine seizure?

44:17.502 --> 44:19.069
No... no. What was that?

44:19.070 --> 44:21.238
Have you been
hiding under a rock?

44:21.239 --> 44:24.074
The guards found
61 bales of cocaine.

44:24.075 --> 44:25.342
440 million euro worth.

44:25.343 --> 44:28.245
- They got it all?
- Yep, every last one.

44:28.246 --> 44:32.448
There won't be any parties
in this country for a while.

44:32.584 --> 44:35.785
Well, that's not good.

44:36.888 --> 44:41.590
FUCK!

45:12.490 --> 45:15.926
<i>Jock was taking the news
that our treasure was gone</i>

45:15.927 --> 45:16.660
<i>better than I expected.</i>

45:16.661 --> 45:20.197
I'm not crying, boy.
It's just hay fever.

45:20.198 --> 45:21.932
Weren't gonna say nothing.

45:21.933 --> 45:25.903
There's so much grass
around here.

45:25.904 --> 45:30.339
The pollen count is really
high as well at the moment.

45:34.312 --> 45:36.280
What's wrong with ya?

45:36.281 --> 45:40.316
I've just gotta take
a wilder-poo, like.

45:40.485 --> 45:41.518
A 'wilder-poo'?

45:41.519 --> 45:44.321
Yeah, boy, I haven't
gone since Cork.

45:44.322 --> 45:46.189
What's a wilder-poo?

45:46.190 --> 45:50.193
It's when you take
a shit outside, like.

45:50.194 --> 45:52.162
You know, a wilderness poo.

45:52.163 --> 45:56.566
- A poo in the wilderness?
- Yeah.

45:56.567 --> 46:00.436
Well, just go, then.
There's no-one here.

46:00.438 --> 46:02.472
But you're here, right?

46:02.473 --> 46:04.174
I'm not gonna look.

46:04.175 --> 46:06.944
I hardly wanna
see you taking a shit.

46:06.945 --> 46:09.413
Alright.
That's not what I meant.

46:09.414 --> 46:13.415
I just need a bit of privacy.
That's all.

46:14.252 --> 46:16.919
I'll be back in a minute.

46:21.392 --> 46:24.760
Jesus. Fuck.

46:53.992 --> 46:56.326
Jock! Come here.

46:56.327 --> 46:58.595
I don't wanna look at your poo.

46:58.596 --> 47:01.864
Just come here a second.

47:03.301 --> 47:05.168
- What is it, boy?
- No!

47:05.169 --> 47:08.537
Don't say a word.

47:11.109 --> 47:13.477
Come on.

47:13.478 --> 47:16.412
Be very quiet.

47:33.498 --> 47:36.199
Holy shit!

47:36.200 --> 47:39.336
He must be
one of them gang members.

47:39.337 --> 47:42.571
Has he got what
I think he's got?

47:44.642 --> 47:48.277
Our treasure.

47:48.613 --> 47:51.415
Fuck, yeah!
You fucker!

47:51.416 --> 47:53.949
Fuck.

47:58.790 --> 48:00.357
- Yo.
- Psst!

48:00.358 --> 48:02.759
He's alive, but he's passed out.

48:02.760 --> 48:04.494
He's bate.

48:04.495 --> 48:07.830
Look, he's got a gammy arm.

48:11.536 --> 48:14.603
He's got a gammy leg too.

48:17.308 --> 48:19.708
He's handicap.

48:20.144 --> 48:22.612
Poor fella.

48:22.613 --> 48:26.149
That'll make it easier.
So come on. Give me a hand.

48:26.150 --> 48:29.186
I'm not stealing
from a handicapped fella.

48:29.187 --> 48:30.387
He's a drug dealer.

48:30.388 --> 48:32.355
What difference does it make
if he's handicapped?

48:32.356 --> 48:34.524
It's like we're being faced
with Stephen Hawking.

48:34.525 --> 48:38.361
This is his chair. You don't
say, "Let's take his chair."

48:38.362 --> 48:39.596
Stephen Hawking?
Who's he again?

48:39.597 --> 48:42.732
The smart guy who's so smart,
he can't walk or talk.

48:42.733 --> 48:44.768
- Do you not know this fella?
- No.

48:44.769 --> 48:47.304
"I am gonna invent
the universe."

48:47.305 --> 48:49.573
He speaks like
he's, like, sucking in.

48:49.574 --> 48:51.141
He's like, "I'm..." Like...

48:51.142 --> 48:55.644
This is what we came for.
We're not leaving without it.

49:00.418 --> 49:04.421
He's probably
holding onto it for warmth.

49:04.422 --> 49:07.489
It's cocaine,
not a hot water bottle.

49:08.459 --> 49:09.860
If he wakes up, we're dead.

49:09.861 --> 49:13.296
- He won't wake up.
- Why are you whispering then?

49:13.297 --> 49:15.265
I'm not whispering.

49:15.266 --> 49:18.701
For fuck's sake!

49:49.200 --> 49:51.735
He's freezing, boy.
We can't just leave him here.

49:51.736 --> 49:53.336
When we're far enough away,

49:53.337 --> 49:57.139
we'll leave an anonymous
phone call for the guards.

50:19.564 --> 50:21.831
Jesus!

50:21.832 --> 50:23.800
Stop yelling! You'll wake him!

50:23.801 --> 50:26.702
He IS fuckin' awake!

50:26.704 --> 50:28.939
- Arggh!
- Arggh! Shit!

50:28.940 --> 50:30.373
Get off!

50:30.374 --> 50:33.942
No! Go... go back
to sleep, please! Fuck!

50:35.213 --> 50:37.414
Fuck! Give me my bag!

50:37.415 --> 50:41.784
Go on! Please! Go!

50:55.800 --> 50:57.234
<i>I never really believed</i>

50:57.235 --> 50:58.702
<i>we would find
that bale of cocaine.</i>

50:58.703 --> 51:02.005
<i>For me, it was just one of them
adventures you go on,</i>

51:02.006 --> 51:03.673
<i>like looking for your G-spot.</i>

51:03.674 --> 51:05.408
<i>You don't really
believe it exists</i>

51:05.409 --> 51:09.279
<i>and you're not sure what
to do with it if you find it.</i>

51:09.280 --> 51:11.281
We did it, kid. We did it!

51:11.282 --> 51:12.648
We sure did, boy!

51:24.629 --> 51:26.029
<i>For Jock, it's different.</i>

51:26.030 --> 51:30.632
<i>Finding that coke
is the only bit of hope he has.</i>

52:08.973 --> 52:11.308
Do you wanna have a gasp
and a drink?

52:11.309 --> 52:12.676
I'd really love one. Thanks.

52:12.677 --> 52:16.612
Mind the bike
while I'm doing this.

52:33.464 --> 52:37.000
Fuck! Shit!

52:37.001 --> 52:39.369
- What the...
- What's going on?

52:39.370 --> 52:41.705
It's gone. It must have
got cut on something.

52:41.706 --> 52:42.539
What do you mean, it got cut?

52:42.540 --> 52:47.377
- There's a hole in the bottom!
- There's a hole in it?

52:47.378 --> 52:48.712
- Look...
- But it's all gone.

52:48.713 --> 52:50.547
I don't know where.
I'm sorry, alright?

52:50.548 --> 52:53.083
Seven million euros worth
of cocaine pour out this bag?

52:53.084 --> 52:54.784
How didn't you notice
it getting lighter?!

52:54.785 --> 52:57.854
How didn't you notice it
coming off the back of my bike?!

52:57.855 --> 52:59.622
'Cause that wasn't
my fuckin' job!

52:59.623 --> 53:03.560
- I gave it to you to look after!
- You have eyes, don't you?

53:03.561 --> 53:06.463
You're some dopey prick,
you know that?

53:06.464 --> 53:08.898
Alright, but don't call me that.

53:08.899 --> 53:10.834
Why not? It's what you are.

53:10.835 --> 53:12.702
I'd rather be a dopey prick

53:12.703 --> 53:16.605
than a devious scumbag like you.

54:32.483 --> 54:35.117
It's too fuckin' tight!

54:35.653 --> 54:38.221
If it isn't Lance Armstrong!

54:38.222 --> 54:40.089
Where the fuck have you been?

54:40.090 --> 54:43.959
Here. Do some real police work.

54:44.161 --> 54:46.862
Who's next there?

54:48.199 --> 54:50.967
I want to report me son missing.
He's not answering his phone.

54:50.968 --> 54:56.004
He's been gone since yesterday.
That's a photo of him there.

55:00.177 --> 55:02.512
I'm gonna catch you
and lock you up

55:02.513 --> 55:04.581
where you belong,
you thieving knacker!

55:04.582 --> 55:07.916
Watch who you callin' knacker.

55:13.591 --> 55:16.192
<i>Do you remember
that prick Billy Murphy?</i>

55:16.193 --> 55:17.894
<i>Well, his time
in the slammer was up</i>

55:17.895 --> 55:21.064
<i>and while inside, he had
a cellmate with a big mouth.</i>

55:21.065 --> 55:23.132
Did I hear something
about a fella going around

55:23.133 --> 55:24.834
wearing your face as a mask
or something?

55:24.835 --> 55:27.537
<i>According to this big mouth,
Jock was flah'ing his sister.</i>

55:27.538 --> 55:30.707
<i>Halfway through, he put on
his fake Billy mask as a joke,</i>

55:30.708 --> 55:32.609
<i>but she didn't
find it very funny.</i>

55:32.610 --> 55:34.577
I hear this screamin'
coming from upstairs

55:34.578 --> 55:36.012
from me sister's room - "Arggh!"

55:36.013 --> 55:38.982
It was just a joke!

55:38.983 --> 55:40.683
"Arggh!"

55:40.684 --> 55:42.018
How's it going?

55:42.019 --> 55:45.021
- Who the fuck was that?!
- None of your business.

55:45.022 --> 55:48.525
<i>Big mouth put two and two
together and got five.</i>

55:48.526 --> 55:53.995
Fake Billy's real name
is Conor MacSweeney.

55:55.833 --> 55:57.867
<i>Billy Murphy's friends
consist of people</i>

55:57.868 --> 55:59.802
<i>he has previously
beaten the shit out of</i>

55:59.803 --> 56:02.871
<i>and they're too scared
not to be his friends.</i>

56:06.176 --> 56:07.143
Shit.

56:07.144 --> 56:08.711
I've been fuckin'
looking for you!

56:08.712 --> 56:10.813
- You little fuckin' prick!
- Fuck off, will ya?

56:10.814 --> 56:12.248
Come here!
Come here, you little shit!

56:12.249 --> 56:14.951
- What are you doing, Billy?
- You're fuckin' dead!

56:14.952 --> 56:18.655
You hear me?
You're fuckin' dead!

56:18.656 --> 56:20.690
Why didn't you fuckin'
tell me it was him?

56:20.691 --> 56:23.626
You're fuckin' useless.
Yeah, look at the ground.

56:23.627 --> 56:25.127
Look at the fuckin' ground.

56:45.082 --> 56:46.214
Dad, are you home?

56:51.822 --> 56:54.489
Nice of you
to finally come home.

56:54.925 --> 56:58.094
You're not gonna tell me
where you've been?

56:58.095 --> 57:01.563
Back here
when I'm talking to you.

57:15.346 --> 57:18.948
The least you can do is offer me
some half-arsed excuse!

57:18.949 --> 57:20.383
Just leave me alone!

57:20.384 --> 57:23.485
What happened to your face?

57:25.222 --> 57:26.555
Nothing.

57:42.373 --> 57:43.973
Are you alright?

57:43.974 --> 57:46.042
Look, I'm grand.

57:46.043 --> 57:49.945
Alright?
I just wanna be left alone.

57:56.186 --> 57:57.285
Fine.

58:31.955 --> 58:35.024
How are you, love? Is the
battery pre-charged in this?

58:35.025 --> 58:37.226
Should be.
Stick in the gas canister

58:37.227 --> 58:40.562
and you'll hear a pump if it is.

58:50.974 --> 58:53.375
What are you making?

58:53.377 --> 58:56.111
I'm not making anything.

58:56.146 --> 58:59.414
What's the nail gun for?

58:59.883 --> 59:02.617
For torturing people.

59:14.331 --> 59:17.133
That's good.

59:17.134 --> 59:19.469
"Torturing."

59:19.470 --> 59:23.072
My husband actually had
one of them. They're great.

59:23.073 --> 59:24.741
Yeah. I'll take that.

59:24.742 --> 59:28.310
That's 375, all in.

59:30.347 --> 59:32.447
Fuck.

59:33.050 --> 59:35.450
I don't have any money.

59:38.088 --> 59:38.888
Fsssh...

59:38.889 --> 59:43.458
Sorry, love,
you can't have it, so.

59:50.400 --> 59:52.301
Careful -
without that safety thing on

59:52.302 --> 59:55.503
those nail guns are lethal.

01:00:05.415 --> 01:00:08.084
Arggh!

01:00:08.085 --> 01:00:10.052
Don't do that.

01:00:10.053 --> 01:00:13.022
It's stuck in the bone.

01:00:13.023 --> 01:00:14.990
Arggh!

01:01:19.456 --> 01:01:21.557
Took you long enough.

01:01:21.558 --> 01:01:25.093
I'm here now, aren't I?

01:01:34.338 --> 01:01:36.205
Are you alright?

01:01:36.206 --> 01:01:38.040
Yeah. Fine.

01:01:38.041 --> 01:01:39.542
It's actually good timing,
you know?

01:01:39.543 --> 01:01:43.179
I was just thinking
about moving out.

01:01:43.180 --> 01:01:46.815
Can I get dressed first
before we go, yeah?

01:01:47.417 --> 01:01:49.684
Yeah. Sure.

01:01:56.894 --> 01:02:00.029
Do you get off on that, yeah?

01:02:00.030 --> 01:02:03.566
What goes on in this house
is none of your business.

01:02:03.567 --> 01:02:06.334
Maybe not.

01:02:06.436 --> 01:02:10.238
But I think I just found
my new hobby.

01:02:13.043 --> 01:02:14.577
<i>Calling all Gardai.</i>

01:02:14.578 --> 01:02:20.315
<i>Be on the lookout for a male
armed with a nail gun.</i>

01:02:31.194 --> 01:02:33.095
Made you your favourite -

01:02:33.096 --> 01:02:34.230
chicken nuggets.

01:02:34.231 --> 01:02:37.133
No, I've
kind of gone off chicken.

01:02:37.134 --> 01:02:39.635
Jesus, what the fuck
happened to you?

01:02:39.636 --> 01:02:42.270
Nothing.

01:02:44.675 --> 01:02:49.410
Are you gonna tell me where you
were for the last two days?

01:02:50.180 --> 01:02:52.247
No.

01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:06.362
Do you think I'm a shit mam?

01:03:06.363 --> 01:03:07.396
Yeah.

01:03:07.397 --> 01:03:09.931
Try having a shit son.

01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:18.975
Go on,
tell me what I can do better.

01:03:18.976 --> 01:03:22.078
No, you called me
fucking retarded last week,

01:03:22.079 --> 01:03:23.379
and there's no need for it.

01:03:23.380 --> 01:03:26.182
You can't call your son that
or he'll grow up with problems.

01:03:26.183 --> 01:03:29.118
Alright. Stop being a retard
and I'll stop calling you one.

01:03:29.119 --> 01:03:31.187
That's exactly
what I mean, like, wh...

01:03:31.188 --> 01:03:33.222
I'm messing with you.
Fucking relax.

01:03:33.223 --> 01:03:35.124
Yeah, but sometimes
you're not messing.

01:03:35.125 --> 01:03:38.294
Just stop calling me
that kind of stuff.

01:03:38.295 --> 01:03:38.761
Alright.

01:03:38.762 --> 01:03:40.363
You have to trust me
a bit more as well.

01:03:40.364 --> 01:03:43.332
It's not you I don't trust.
It's Jock I don't trust.

01:03:43.333 --> 01:03:47.036
- Why not?
- Because Jock's a total fuck-up.

01:03:47.037 --> 01:03:48.471
He's such a laugh, like.

01:03:48.472 --> 01:03:49.705
He's the only fella in school

01:03:49.706 --> 01:03:51.107
that, kind of,
makes me feel warm...

01:03:51.108 --> 01:03:56.911
Not 'warm', like, but...
makes me feel nice, like.

01:03:57.314 --> 01:03:59.482
Are you gay?
Is that what this is?

01:03:59.483 --> 01:04:00.583
I mean, it's grand if you are.

01:04:00.584 --> 01:04:02.785
Like, fuck,
it'll actually explain a lot.

01:04:02.786 --> 01:04:04.353
No, Mam, I'm not gay.

01:04:04.354 --> 01:04:07.656
But if I was, hypopharically...

01:04:07.657 --> 01:04:10.526
..hypoth... hypothetic...
hypothetically...

01:04:10.527 --> 01:04:12.094
- Hypothetically.
- Hypothetically.

01:04:12.095 --> 01:04:15.431
He'd be the guy
I'd want to be gay with.

01:04:15.432 --> 01:04:18.566
Who says that?

01:04:21.571 --> 01:04:24.173
Jock, is that you?

01:04:24.174 --> 01:04:26.108
- Alright, boy?
- It's alright.

01:04:26.109 --> 01:04:28.444
There was this weird-looking
fella there came up to me

01:04:28.445 --> 01:04:30.479
by about 15 minutes ago
by the garage.

01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:31.580
Hang on a sec. Who's that?

01:04:31.581 --> 01:04:34.316
He was kind of sloping down
and he was dragging his leg.

01:04:34.317 --> 01:04:36.318
A zombie. A zombie.
That's what he looked like.

01:04:36.319 --> 01:04:39.188
- Are you a guard, or what?
- Do I look like a guard? No.

01:04:39.189 --> 01:04:42.291
- He had a picture in his hand.
- Do you know where he lives?

01:04:42.292 --> 01:04:43.726
And he was, like,
"Conor MacSweeney."

01:04:43.727 --> 01:04:45.528
- Conor MacSweeney.
- "Conor MacSweeney."

01:04:45.529 --> 01:04:47.329
- "Where does he live?"
- He's a friend of yours.

01:04:47.330 --> 01:04:49.498
He looks just like you. All
you little fuckers are the same.

01:04:49.499 --> 01:04:51.734
- My friend Conor MacSweeney?
- I swear to fuck.

01:04:51.735 --> 01:04:53.502
He has something
that belongs to me.

01:04:53.503 --> 01:04:55.571
- Cocaine?
- He said nothing about cocaine.

01:04:55.572 --> 01:04:58.641
So you didn't say nothing?
What about the rest of the boys?

01:04:58.642 --> 01:05:00.409
One of them,
alright, no, said...

01:05:00.410 --> 01:05:01.610
"We know
where he lives, actually."

01:05:01.611 --> 01:05:03.712
He was like,
"I know where he lives."

01:05:03.713 --> 01:05:05.081
What the fuck you doing, boy?

01:05:05.082 --> 01:05:06.749
I nudged him. I was like,
"Are you fucking slow?"

01:05:06.750 --> 01:05:10.286
- I said, "Shut the fuck up!"
- Just tell me where he lives!

01:05:10.287 --> 01:05:12.687
Get the fuck...! Get...

01:05:14.858 --> 01:05:18.260
- Come here. Come here!
- Get off me, you fucking...

01:05:18.261 --> 01:05:20.429
Five minutes later, then,
I was thinking to myself,

01:05:20.430 --> 01:05:22.331
"It's Conor MacSweeney
he's on about."

01:05:22.332 --> 01:05:24.400
Everyone knows
where that dopey mog lives.

01:05:24.401 --> 01:05:25.534
He's still around, play it wide?

01:05:25.535 --> 01:05:27.670
Fuck's sake. Alright.
Cheers! Nice one.

01:05:27.671 --> 01:05:29.505
- See you later.
- See you later.

01:05:29.506 --> 01:05:31.240
Sorry,
I gotta do something important.

01:05:31.241 --> 01:05:33.342
I'll be back later, I promise!

01:05:33.343 --> 01:05:36.512
Look, I just don't want you to
be a total fuck-up, alright?

01:05:36.513 --> 01:05:38.280
I'm not gonna be
a total fuck-up.

01:05:38.281 --> 01:05:41.817
I'll fuck up along the way,
like, but I'm not gonna...

01:05:41.818 --> 01:05:42.618
Do you promise?

01:05:42.619 --> 01:05:44.353
..I'm not gonna fuck up
my whole life.

01:05:44.354 --> 01:05:47.656
And if I'm being
brutally honest...

01:05:47.657 --> 01:05:52.161
..you're not the shittest mam
in town, so,

01:05:52.162 --> 01:05:54.430
that's the only compliment
you're getting

01:05:54.431 --> 01:05:55.664
at this point in time.

01:05:55.665 --> 01:05:56.699
I'll take that. Thank you.

01:05:56.700 --> 01:05:58.834
Well,
that's all you're getting, so...

01:05:58.835 --> 01:06:00.803
You're not retarded.

01:06:00.804 --> 01:06:02.138
Most of the time.

01:06:02.139 --> 01:06:05.241
Come on, Mam.
I'm only messing with you.

01:06:05.242 --> 01:06:07.209
- Say one thing good about me.
- I'm only...

01:06:07.210 --> 01:06:08.878
Say one thing good about me
or I'm gonna cry!

01:06:08.879 --> 01:06:11.180
You're a really, really good
son. You're a good son.

01:06:11.181 --> 01:06:14.749
That's very vague.
What do you like about me?

01:06:15.785 --> 01:06:18.154
You're really sweet.

01:06:18.155 --> 01:06:18.821
Yeah. Now...

01:06:18.822 --> 01:06:21.257
- And you're thoughtful.
- You're so vague!

01:06:21.258 --> 01:06:23.259
Pr... what's... what's...
what's...

01:06:23.260 --> 01:06:25.461
What do I do that... you like?

01:06:25.462 --> 01:06:27.830
Do you remember that time
on my birthday last year?

01:06:27.831 --> 01:06:29.632
- And I thought you forgot?
- Yeah?

01:06:29.633 --> 01:06:33.701
And you bought me flowers,
and it was just...

01:06:34.304 --> 01:06:36.904
..it was just really nice.

01:06:37.407 --> 01:06:38.607
Cool.

01:06:38.608 --> 01:06:40.376
It was just really nice.

01:06:40.377 --> 01:06:42.511
Alright, but don't cry.

01:06:42.512 --> 01:06:44.746
I'm not crying.

01:06:44.781 --> 01:06:48.317
- It was a year ago.
- I know.

01:06:48.318 --> 01:06:49.351
I know.

01:06:49.352 --> 01:06:50.786
Eat your food, you weirdo.

01:06:50.787 --> 01:06:54.890
- Fuckin' hell.
- You sure you don't want one?

01:06:54.891 --> 01:06:57.960
No, I don't want one.

01:06:57.961 --> 01:07:00.729
I don't either, actually.
It's disgusting.

01:07:00.730 --> 01:07:01.964
Told you get the nice ones.

01:07:01.965 --> 01:07:04.400
- What?
- Get the nice ones next time.

01:07:04.401 --> 01:07:05.668
Yeah.

01:07:05.669 --> 01:07:08.537
We're in major fucking shit!
But I got a plan!

01:07:08.538 --> 01:07:09.838
Jock, my fucking mam's here.

01:07:09.839 --> 01:07:12.241
- How are you, Mrs MacSweeney?
- How are you, Jock?

01:07:12.242 --> 01:07:14.577
- Can we talk somewhere else?
- No. We haven't got time.

01:07:14.578 --> 01:07:17.980
The dealer we stole the cocaine
off is coming. He's not happy.

01:07:17.981 --> 01:07:20.516
- What?
- It's not as bad as it sounds.

01:07:20.517 --> 01:07:21.750
Yeah, it IS as bad as it sounds.

01:07:21.751 --> 01:07:23.452
You're un-fucking-believable,
do you know that?

01:07:23.453 --> 01:07:26.789
We wouldn't be in this mess
if it weren't for you.

01:07:26.790 --> 01:07:28.757
- And why's that?
- Who lost all the cocaine?

01:07:28.758 --> 01:07:31.927
Whose bright idea was it
to steal it in the first place

01:07:31.928 --> 01:07:34.862
from a dangerous fucking
drug dealer, Jock?

01:07:35.565 --> 01:07:35.998
Quits?

01:07:35.999 --> 01:07:38.000
Mam? Mam, what are you doing?

01:07:38.001 --> 01:07:40.603
I'm calling the guards before
that drug dealer arrives.

01:07:40.604 --> 01:07:42.771
- What?
- You can't! Think about it.

01:07:42.772 --> 01:07:44.740
Do you really want
a convict for a son?

01:07:44.741 --> 01:07:46.909
- What?
- Who's gonna cover your days off

01:07:46.910 --> 01:07:49.578
in the shop
when I'm being raped in prison?

01:07:49.579 --> 01:07:50.646
You're young offenders.

01:07:50.647 --> 01:07:51.947
You'll end up in
a juvenile detention centre.

01:07:51.948 --> 01:07:54.516
There's rapists there too.
They're just a bit younger.

01:07:54.517 --> 01:07:58.320
- Here. Hold this.
- What are you planning on doing?

01:07:58.321 --> 01:07:59.822
- Baking him a cake?
- Buy us some time.

01:07:59.823 --> 01:08:02.458
Do you honestly think he's not
gonna know the difference

01:08:02.459 --> 01:08:03.959
between self-raising flour
and uncut cocaine?

01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:06.495
- He's a fucking drug dealer!
- Shake it!

01:08:06.496 --> 01:08:07.263
Is he far away?

01:08:07.264 --> 01:08:10.865
Well, fuck, I don't have
a GPS on him, do I?

01:08:12.435 --> 01:08:14.836
Fuck!

01:08:14.904 --> 01:08:18.005
Do drug dealers ring doorbells?

01:08:21.645 --> 01:08:26.314
You two - stay out of sight.
I'm gonna see who's at the door.

01:08:26.316 --> 01:08:28.584
Yeah. Use the spy hole.

01:08:28.585 --> 01:08:30.486
Make sure he doesn't see you.

01:08:30.487 --> 01:08:31.720
You think I'm fucking thick?

01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:34.423
- Well, now that you mention...
- Shut the fuck up.

01:08:34.424 --> 01:08:37.959
- Use a fake name.
- Shut the fuck up!

01:08:47.404 --> 01:08:49.904
- Well, who is it?
- It's a guard.

01:08:49.906 --> 01:08:52.541
It's Healy.
He knows we stole them bikes.

01:08:52.542 --> 01:08:55.010
- You stole bikes?
- Jock stole bikes.

01:08:55.011 --> 01:08:56.679
I didn't hear you complaining

01:08:56.680 --> 01:08:59.782
when you were sitting on one
on the way down to West Cork.

01:08:59.783 --> 01:09:00.783
What are we gonna do?

01:09:00.783 --> 01:09:04.620
I can hear everything you're
saying. Open the fucking door.

01:09:04.621 --> 01:09:07.287
Bollocks.

01:09:11.861 --> 01:09:15.763
Right.
What the fuck is going on?

01:09:19.469 --> 01:09:23.072
Why don't we go inside
for a nice cup of tea?

01:09:23.073 --> 01:09:26.640
See if we can figure it all out.

01:09:31.948 --> 01:09:36.317
How are ya?

01:09:37.087 --> 01:09:41.122
You gonna invite me in
or what the fuck?

01:09:41.558 --> 01:09:44.359
Fuck.

Sorry. F...

- No, it's grand.

- No. It's... Leave it.

01:10:22.699 --> 01:10:24.865

A bit of coke, is it?

I can get coke.
Is that alright with you?

01:16:25.228 --> 01:16:29.229
Yeah. There's no problem. What
do you want, a couple of grams?

01:16:30.967 --> 01:16:32.234
Fuck! That really hurts!
