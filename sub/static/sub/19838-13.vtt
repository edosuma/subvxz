<b>We aren't here to get in your way.</b>

00:13.160 --> 00:15.030
<b>In fact, you could say we're here to help.</b>

00:15.600 --> 00:16.530
<b>Help?</b>

00:17.010 --> 00:18.070
<b>Yeah.</b>

00:18.070 --> 00:21.810
<b>If we get the top score on 
the quiz and win the card,</b>

<b>we want to sell it to you for 2.5 billion.</b>

00:24.940 --> 00:28.270
<b>That's only five percent of your reward.</b>

00:28.270 --> 00:30.050
<b>It's a reasonable price, yeah?</b>

00:30.540 --> 00:32.510
<b><i>Oh, right...</i></b>

00:32.510 --> 00:35.000
<b><i>They haven't heard about Battera yet.</i></b>

<b>Sure, if you get the top score.</b>

00:41.080 --> 00:44.840
<b>Everyone else is here for the chance

00:44.840 --> 00:46.750
<b>With the game ending,</b>

00:46.750 --> 00:50.320
<b>they're all hoping to share in the reward.</b>

00:50.850 --> 00:54.310
<b>It looks like they're going

00:54.750 --> 00:56.500
<b>What should we do?</b>

00:56.500 --> 00:59.320
<b>What? We should do it by ourselves.</b>

00:59.320 --> 01:00.320
<b>Yeah.</b>

01:00.320 --> 01:02.760
<b>Whoever scores lower gets penalized.</b>

01:02.760 --> 01:04.210
<b>Okay, I'm in!</b>

01:05.050 --> 01:07.960
<b><i>Honestly... They've got guts.</i></b>

01:08.730 --> 01:10.750
<b><i>They just came from a fight to the death,</i></b>

01:10.750 --> 01:14.970
<b><i>and now they're facing the final event

01:15.560 --> 01:19.430
<b><i>I bet those two enjoyed this

<b>What is the condition to obtain

<b>Congratulations.</b>

04:51.730 --> 04:52.560
<b>Thanks.</b>

04:56.500 --> 04:58.140
<b>How many points did I get?</b>

<b>So Limeiro is the capital?</b>

<b>I have to go alone?</b>

05:21.680 --> 05:23.770
<b>We'll wait for you by the castle.</b>

<b>Hey, he really got it.</b>

05:33.910 --> 05:36.110
<b>That kid really collected all the cards.</b>

<b>Hey, let's have a contest with

05:41.250 --> 05:44.000
<b>Sorry, but you don't have a choice.</b>

06:11.680 --> 06:15.180

<b>then come back for you guys.</b>

06:17.250 --> 06:19.190

<b>Limeiro!</b>

06:48.250 --> 06:50.790
<b>They wiped the floor with the Belum brothers.</b>

06:50.790 --> 06:52.780
<b>Of course...</b>

06:52.780 --> 06:55.350
<b>They even defeated the bombers.</b>

06:57.220 --> 06:58.350
<b><i>It's true,</i></b>

06:59.340 --> 07:04.240
<b><i>those boys are much stronger

<b><i>But they're still weaker than

07:09.120 --> 07:11.820
<b><i>They must have executed a brilliant plan...</i></b>

07:13.040 --> 07:14.320

<b>Hmm...</b>

09:45.960 --> 09:47.560
<b>Oh, here it is!</b>

09:49.580 --> 09:50.430
<b>This is it.</b>

09:51.390 --> 09:52.530
<b>Open it up.</b>

09:53.680 --> 09:58.390
<b>You can place three restricted

<b>However!</b>

10:04.590 --> 10:07.990
<b>You cannot take multiple

10:07.990 --> 10:14.490
<b>You must choose three different restricted

<b>Okay, you've reached the ending...</b>

10:21.720 --> 10:25.570
<b>Do you want the normal ending,

10:26.020 --> 10:27.100
<b>Just for me?</b>

10:27.100 --> 10:28.820
<b>Yep, that's right.</b>

10:28.820 --> 10:30.500
<b>Which one do you want? Well?</b>

10:32.370 --> 10:33.940
<b>Then I'll take the normal one.</b>

10:34.820 --> 10:36.110
<b>Why would you choose that one?</b>

10:36.460 --> 10:39.300
<b>I didn't clear the game alone, and if it's</b>

10:39.300 --> 10:41.860
<b>the normal ending, my friends 
can watch with me, right?</b>

10:43.050 --> 10:44.430
<b>I see...</b>

10:44.430 --> 10:45.540
<b>Dwun-san?</b>

10:45.540 --> 10:45.870
<b>Huh?</b>

10:46.570 --> 10:48.900
<b>Would you stop teasing him?</b>

10:48.900 --> 10:50.160
<b>I'm sorry...</b>

10:50.160 --> 10:52.880
<b>There's no such thing as an ending just for you.</b>

10:52.880 --> 10:54.840
<b>What? Really?</b>

10:54.840 --> 10:59.630
<b>However, there's a message we've been told 
to give you only after you beat the game.</b>

11:02.000 --> 11:05.330
<b>Sorry for taking so long to introduce ourselves.</b>

11:05.740 --> 11:07.100
<b>I'm List.</b>

11:07.100 --> 11:08.340
<b>He's Dwun.</b>

11:08.340 --> 11:12.400
<b>As you probably know, 
we're friends of your old man.</b>

11:13.380 --> 11:17.340
<b>This game was created by Ging 
and ten of his friends.</b>

11:18.200 --> 11:20.330
<b>The name "Greed Island" was created</b>

11:20.330 --> 11:24.310
<b>from the first letter in each of their names.</b>

11:24.950 --> 11:27.910
<b>Your father was in charge,</b>

11:27.910 --> 11:32.020
<b>so we wanted a word that began 
with "G," and settled on "Greed."</b>

11:32.640 --> 11:34.300
<b>Have you met Razor?</b>

11:34.300 --> 11:36.780
<b>He's the "R," and I'm the "L."</b>

11:37.220 --> 11:39.860
<b>The girl who explains the game at the start</b>

11:39.860 --> 11:42.610
<b>is the twin of the girl you see 
when leaving the island.</b>

11:42.610 --> 11:44.120
<b>Eeta and Elena.</b>

11:44.120 --> 11:46.320
<b>Both names begin with "E."</b>

11:47.670 --> 11:50.240
<b>And then, we have "D"!</b>

11:50.600 --> 11:53.150
<b>Wanna hear my story? Well?</b>

11:53.150 --> 11:54.840
<b>Yeah? Yeah? Yeah?</b>

11:54.840 --> 11:56.150
<b>Y-Yeah...</b>

11:56.710 --> 11:58.130
<b>Okay, pay attention.</b>

11:58.840 --> 12:01.650
<b>You see, that Ging...</b>

12:02.860 --> 12:06.890
<b>was a totally mean guy!</b>

12:06.890 --> 12:08.430
<b>Totally mean!</b>

12:10.510 --> 12:12.400
<b>My name is Dwun!</b>

12:12.400 --> 12:14.170
<b>What do you think is the first letter?</b>

12:14.520 --> 12:16.420
<b>Huh? Isn't it "D"?</b>

12:17.410 --> 12:19.300
<b>Even you, huh?</b>

12:19.620 --> 12:21.150
<b>Of course you'd think so...</b>

12:21.150 --> 12:23.330
<b>After all, you're Ging's son.</b>

12:23.330 --> 12:25.180
<b>Weren't we talking about "D"?</b>

12:25.180 --> 12:27.700
<b>It's "W!" "W!"</b>

12:27.700 --> 12:31.480
<b>W-d-w-u-n-e.</b>

12:31.480 --> 12:32.450
<b>Wdwune!</b>

12:32.710 --> 12:34.060
<b>That was my name!</b>

12:34.480 --> 12:38.570
<b>But even my oldest friends 
thought it began with "D."</b>

12:39.460 --> 12:42.870
<b>So when we decided on the 
game's name, I was clear...</b>

12:42.870 --> 12:45.520
<b>That my name began with "W."</b>

12:45.520 --> 12:48.080
<b>What do you think Ging said?</b>

12:48.660 --> 12:49.650
<b><i>Really?</i></b>

12:49.650 --> 12:51.240
<b><i>Then, ditch the "W."</i></b>

12:51.630 --> 12:55.480
<b><i>Starting now, your name is D-w-u-n...</i></b>

12:55.480 --> 12:56.530
<b><i>Dwun.</i></b>

12:59.490 --> 13:00.960
<b>Can you believe him?</b>

13:01.480 --> 13:04.220
<b>He changed my name without asking.</b>

13:04.220 --> 13:07.360
<b>Just so the title of the game would work!</b>

13:07.360 --> 13:08.860
<b>What's really amazing</b>

13:08.860 --> 13:12.970
<b>is that Ging had legally changed 
the name a minute later.</b>

13:12.970 --> 13:15.230
<b>He only needed a phone and a computer.</b>

13:15.920 --> 13:21.230
<b>What's worse is that he even removed 
the "E" because he got confused!</b>

13:21.470 --> 13:24.890
<b>But your luck has been better as a result.</b>

13:25.200 --> 13:27.900
<b>I guess! Ever since...</b>

14:02.820 --> 14:07.040
<b>Once I've chosen the three cards, 
I'm supposed to go to the port.</b>

14:07.430 --> 14:10.030
<b>Did they tell you about your father?</b>

14:10.390 --> 14:14.420
<b>Yeah, but they don't know 
where he is right now.</b>

14:14.420 --> 14:15.760
<b>Oh...</b>

14:15.760 --> 14:19.470
<b>So I guess the game didn't have any clues.</b>

14:20.020 --> 14:23.170
<b>Well, that's what the starting message said.</b>

14:23.430 --> 14:25.190
<b>Yeah, that's true.</b>

14:25.190 --> 14:28.600
<b>So, what will you do for the three cards?</b>

14:28.600 --> 14:31.050
<b>How about we each pick one?</b>

14:31.050 --> 14:33.930
<b>Blue Planet 

A gemstone with an 
incomparable blue shine. 
Its composition matches 
no known minerals, 
so it's named for its 
otherworldly nature.</b>

14:31.640 --> 14:34.540
<b>Then I want Blue Planet!</b>

14:34.540 --> 14:36.410
<b>This is still the best one!</b>

14:37.170 --> 14:39.690
<b>I can't wait to see the real thing...</b>

14:40.630 --> 14:42.390
<b>Which one do you want, Killua?</b>

14:43.880 --> 14:45.330
<b>I'm still thinking.</b>

14:45.330 --> 14:46.780
<b>Have you decided, Gon?</b>

14:46.780 --> 14:48.700
<b>Yeah, I think so.</b>

14:48.700 --> 14:50.220
<b>Really? Which one?</b>

14:50.650 --> 14:51.950
<b>Let's see...</b>

14:52.830 --> 14:53.630
<b>This one.</b>

14:53.630 --> 14:54.640
<b>Which one?</b>

14:56.180 --> 14:58.480
<b>Wait, why this one?</b>

14:58.920 --> 15:00.050
<b>I get it.</b>

15:00.350 --> 15:01.690
<b>That makes sense.</b>

15:01.690 --> 15:04.210
<b>You're only allowed to take 
restricted slot cards...</b>

15:04.870 --> 15:06.590
<b>Yep, that sounds fun!</b>

15:07.250 --> 15:08.790
<b>When did you have the idea?</b>

15:10.460 --> 15:12.090
<b>The moment I saw this card.</b>

15:12.090 --> 15:15.910
<b>Paladin's Necklace 

When a player wears this, 
all spells targeting player 
will be reflected. 
Can also dispel curses 
placed on any card 
touched by player.</b>

15:12.870 --> 15:15.340
<b>But this one won't be enough.</b>

15:15.340 --> 15:17.360
<b>Right, we also need this one.</b>

15:15.910 --> 15:18.100
<b>Transform 

Change one card in your possession into any 
other card in your possession. (Card will now 
count against the limit of new card type. If limit has already been reached, nothing will happen, 
and the Transform card will be destroyed.) 

[SR][NORM]</b>

15:17.360 --> 15:18.100
<b>Eh?</b>

15:18.660 --> 15:20.250
<b>Do you think this will work?</b>

15:20.660 --> 15:21.530
<b>Yeah.</b>

15:21.530 --> 15:24.170
<b>And this is the only way to do it!</b>

15:24.170 --> 15:25.700
<b>Wait, what is this?</b>

15:25.700 --> 15:26.980
<b>What are you talking about?</b>

15:27.560 --> 15:30.490
<b>You're okay with Blue Planet, Bisky?</b>

15:30.880 --> 15:33.490
<b>Let me in on this!</b>

15:43.240 --> 15:45.460
<b>Congratulations on clearing the game.</b>

15:46.180 --> 15:51.470
<b>Please choose three restricted 
slot cards from your binder.</b>

15:53.970 --> 15:57.720
<b>You've chosen #2, Patch of Shore,</b>

15:54.950 --> 15:57.700
<b>Patch of Shore 

The entrance to an 
underwater cavern known 
as the Sea God's Grotto. 
The cavern changes 
every time you enter.</b>

15:57.700 --> 16:00.330
<b>Blue Planet 

A gemstone with an 
incomparable blue shine. 
Its composition matches 
no known minerals, 
so it's named for its 
otherworldly nature.</b>

15:58.190 --> 16:00.410
<b>#81, Blue Planet,</b>

16:00.330 --> 16:04.050
<b>Paladin's Necklace

all spells targeting player

16:03.770 --> 16:06.770
<b>Are you sure these are the three cards you want?</b>

16:06.770 --> 16:07.600
<b>Yep.</b>

16:08.750 --> 16:10.740
<b>Then I will now return your ring.</b>

16:11.240 --> 16:12.920
<b>Good work.</b>

16:14.930 --> 16:16.180
<b>Thank you...</b>

16:16.500 --> 16:18.620
<b>Uh, Elena-san!</b>

16:20.170 --> 16:21.760
<b>You remembered my name?</b>

16:21.760 --> 16:22.870
<b>Thank you.</b>

16:24.920 --> 16:26.180
<b>Goodbye.</b>

16:35.610 --> 16:36.700
<b>Welcome back!</b>

16:36.700 --> 16:37.620
<b>Yeah.</b>

16:38.780 --> 16:42.020
<b>We're back in the real world now?</b>

16:42.610 --> 16:44.010
<b>I can't tell.</b>

16:44.010 --> 16:46.900
<b>Well, the game was part of the real world.</b>

16:46.900 --> 16:48.450
<b>Hey, hurry up!</b>

16:48.450 --> 16:50.150
<b>Bring out your binder...</b>

17:03.840 --> 17:05.040
<b>This is what I wanted!</b>

17:05.620 --> 17:08.540
<b>The Blue Planet I've dreamed of for so long!</b>

17:11.270 --> 17:13.360
<b>I'm so happy!</b>

17:13.360 --> 17:14.790
<b>What should I name it?</b>

17:14.790 --> 17:15.830
<b>Pla-chan?</b>

17:15.830 --> 17:17.220
<b>Maybe Blue-chan?</b>

17:17.220 --> 17:18.270
<b>Planet-chan?</b>

17:18.270 --> 17:20.750
<b>Yep, I'll go with Planet-chan!</b>

17:23.910 --> 17:27.920
<b>So, are you sure about the two you picked?</b>

17:28.230 --> 17:30.770
<b>Yeah, these are the best ones, right?</b>

17:30.770 --> 17:31.440
<b>Yep.</b>

17:32.340 --> 17:33.820
<b>Then let's give it a go!</b>

17:34.080 --> 17:34.950
<b>Yeah!</b>

17:35.410 --> 17:36.180
<b><i>Gain!</i></b>

17:41.040 --> 17:42.450
<b>Give it to me, Killua.</b>

17:52.550 --> 17:54.690
<b>Yes! It worked!</b>

17:54.690 --> 17:55.720
<b>Okay!</b>

17:56.100 --> 17:57.350
<b>I see.</b>

17:57.870 --> 18:02.030
<b>You used Transform to make 
Accompany a restricted slot card,</b>

18:02.030 --> 18:04.960
<b>then used Paladin's Necklace to revert it.</b>

18:05.730 --> 18:07.600
<b>That's clever thinking...</b>

18:08.510 --> 18:11.870
<b>But I'm surprised you'd do 
all that for an Accompany,</b>

18:11.870 --> 18:15.990
<b>rather than choose a restricted slot card.</b>

18:15.990 --> 18:16.750
<b>Yeah...</b>

18:17.410 --> 18:22.240
<b>Well, if I hadn't been the first 
one of us to enter the game,</b>

18:22.240 --> 18:24.340
<b>I probably wouldn't have noticed.</b>

18:25.850 --> 18:28.120
<b>Remember when we played 
rock-paper-scissors here?</b>

18:28.520 --> 18:29.780
<b>Rock-paper-scissors?</b>

18:29.780 --> 18:30.500
<b>Yeah.</b>

18:32.250 --> 18:34.250
<b>I was the first to enter the game.</b>

18:35.090 --> 18:39.570
<b>And while I was waiting for Killua, 
no one else was around.</b>

18:40.320 --> 18:43.140
<b>Which means the first person I met in the game</b>

18:43.140 --> 18:46.010
<b>should have been the second 
one to go in, Goreinu-san.</b>

18:47.080 --> 18:49.650
<b>But when I checked my binder,</b>

18:50.090 --> 18:53.310
<b>there was someone I met before him.</b>

18:51.920 --> 18:55.420
<b>Nigg 

Goreinu</b>

18:55.670 --> 18:59.530
<b>Ging is spelled G-i-n-g.</b>

19:00.240 --> 19:03.910
<b>Oh, so Nigg is an anagram!</b>

19:06.410 --> 19:11.420
<b>My guess is that when I was a 
baby, I came here with Ging.</b>

19:13.870 --> 19:17.040
<b>He was probably trying to tell me this:</b>

19:18.260 --> 19:21.280
<b>If I'm ready to give up everything to find him,</b>

19:21.280 --> 19:25.080
<b>I have to get strong enough 
to clear the game...</b>

19:31.860 --> 19:34.920
<b>Your dedication is really something.</b>

19:35.510 --> 19:38.440
<b>Well? What will you do once you find Ging?</b>

19:38.900 --> 19:41.370
<b>Naturally, I'll introduce him to Killua!</b>

19:42.340 --> 19:44.900
<b>My best friend in the world!</b>

19:46.260 --> 19:48.300
<b>Stupid! Cut that out!</b>

19:48.300 --> 19:49.650
<b>It's embarrassing...</b>

19:52.280 --> 19:53.330
<b>Really...</b>

19:53.980 --> 19:55.790
<b>Stop it...</b>

20:03.240 --> 20:04.720
<b>I can't take this!</b>

20:04.720 --> 20:06.210
<b>It must be age.</b>

20:06.210 --> 20:08.560
<b>It doesn't take much to make me cry...</b>

20:09.970 --> 20:13.350
<b>Hey, wanna come with us to see Ging?</b>

20:15.670 --> 20:18.330
<b>No, I'll pass.</b>

20:19.100 --> 20:21.540
<b>I'm not interested in men who already have kids.</b>

20:23.810 --> 20:24.770
<b>Okay.</b>

<b><i>If I stay with you any longer,

<b>Well, take care, Bisky.</b>

<b>Yeah.</b>
