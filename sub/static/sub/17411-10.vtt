               .

00:02.503 --> 00:04.636
       - I can't believe
    I got assigned baseball

00:04.638 --> 00:05.637
         As my activity
   at my school's field day.

00:05.639 --> 00:07.139
  - Those are the breaks, man.

00:07.141 --> 00:10.342
      Where you could hide
       on defense? Sure.

00:10.344 --> 00:14.013
 Or basketball, where you could
avoid ball contact? Absolutely.

00:14.015 --> 00:16.315
 But the gods gave us baseball,
             so...

00:16.317 --> 00:20.019
- Well, we have 48 hours to get
 less terrible, so here we go.

00:20.021 --> 00:21.153
      First things first,

00:21.155 --> 00:22.254
      We got to look like
         a ballplayer.

00:22.256 --> 00:23.255
  So what I want you to do is,

00:23.257 --> 00:25.724
    Grab your junk and spit.

00:25.726 --> 00:26.725
            [spits]

00:26.727 --> 00:27.793
           - My what?

00:27.795 --> 00:29.028
         - Maybe just--
           just spit.

00:29.030 --> 00:30.029
       Do the spit part.

00:30.031 --> 00:32.164
    - [coughs, spits weakly]

00:32.165 --> 00:33.732
   - That was the worst spit
        I've ever seen.

00:33.734 --> 00:36.568
        Maybe get the--
     oh, you got a hankie.

00:36.570 --> 00:39.638
           All right,
let's set up a home plate here.

00:39.640 --> 00:41.573
     So here is home plate.

00:41.575 --> 00:43.175
     All right, batter up.

00:43.177 --> 00:44.376
   Okay, I'm gonna pitch you
           the ball.

00:44.378 --> 00:48.180
         Lean into it.
          Here we go.

00:48.182 --> 00:52.251
All right, that wasn't that bad.

00:52.253 --> 00:53.419
   Oh, that actually was bad.

00:53.421 --> 00:55.054
 - So do you think my teammates

00:55.056 --> 00:58.057
Will limit their disappointment
   to just verbal beratement,

00:58.059 --> 01:00.259
         Or am I facing
    an actual beatdown here?

01:00.261 --> 01:01.427
           Be honest.

01:01.429 --> 01:02.761
      It's the uncertainty
      that's hard for me.

01:02.763 --> 01:04.196
          - Big news.

01:04.197 --> 01:05.664
 Guess who's coming for a visit
        from antarctica.

01:05.666 --> 01:07.433
          - [squeals]
      - his plane landed.

01:07.435 --> 01:08.667
 He's gonna be here any second.

01:08.669 --> 01:09.768
          - [squeals]

01:09.770 --> 01:11.103
     - And he's gonna stay
        for three days.

01:11.105 --> 01:12.304
       Three whole days.

01:12.306 --> 01:13.305
          - [squeals]

01:13.307 --> 01:15.407
    - Okay, stop that noise,
            please.

01:15.409 --> 01:17.810
        Use your words.
   - Words? I have no words.

01:17.812 --> 01:20.212
        All I have is...
     [squealing, laughing]

01:20.214 --> 01:23.315
        [car horn honks]

01:23.317 --> 01:25.117
          [squealing]

01:25.119 --> 01:26.118
          - All right,
     everybody settle down.

01:26.120 --> 01:27.252
        Who do you know
        from antarctica?

01:27.254 --> 01:29.121
            - Daddy!
         - Oh, my god.

01:29.123 --> 01:32.224
       Isn't he just like
         sean connery?

     [cheers and applause]

02:09.829 --> 02:12.197
     - Oh, I am so excited
       you're here, dad.

02:12.199 --> 02:13.298
   Did you bring me presents?

02:13.300 --> 02:15.534
            - What?
   Did I bring you presents?

02:15.536 --> 02:18.237
    Of course I brought you
           presents.

02:18.239 --> 02:21.240
            [laughs]
         how exciting.

02:21.242 --> 02:22.241
      - Looks like someone
   forgot to do a nut check.

02:22.243 --> 02:24.209
           - Oh, god.
           Yeah, oh.

02:24.211 --> 02:26.211
 Marcus's dad obviously forgot

02:26.213 --> 02:27.579
  That peanuts will kill him.

02:27.581 --> 02:28.647
           - [gasps]
             right.

02:28.649 --> 02:29.748
  - These were obviously meant

02:29.750 --> 02:31.283
       As a toy, darling.

02:31.285 --> 02:32.618
         Look, maracas.

           -<i> Arriba!</i>

02:33.821 --> 02:35.387
        - If that breaks
    even a tiny little bit,

02:35.389 --> 02:36.922
     Don't think about it,
           just run.

02:36.924 --> 02:38.290
             - Hmm.
            - Okay?

02:38.292 --> 02:39.224
             - Hi.

02:39.226 --> 02:40.292
           Neighbor.

02:40.294 --> 02:42.161
             - Ah.
            Father.

02:42.163 --> 02:44.163
            - Will.
          - [squeals]

02:44.165 --> 02:45.397
   The two most important men
           in my life

02:45.399 --> 02:47.266
    Are meeting each other!

02:47.268 --> 02:48.367
            [laughs]
           - charmed.

02:48.369 --> 02:49.735
  Or, as a penguin would say,

02:49.737 --> 02:51.737
   "kee kee kee kee kee kee,
             honk!"

02:51.739 --> 02:54.339
           [laughter]

02:54.341 --> 02:57.209
   If we were really meeting
          as penguins,

02:57.211 --> 02:58.644
         You would bow
     and quiver before me.

02:58.646 --> 03:01.747
          - [chuckles]
        you first, man.

03:01.749 --> 03:04.483
       - Marcus's dad is
      a penguin researcher

03:04.485 --> 03:08.353
   Which, as you can imagine,
      is quite glamorous.

03:08.355 --> 03:09.354
            - Quite.
          - Yeah, no.

03:09.356 --> 03:10.489
   I can't even imagine that.

03:10.491 --> 03:12.925
   A powerpoint presentation
            for you.

03:12.927 --> 03:14.693
            - Will,
  you have to come over later.

03:14.695 --> 03:17.930
       It will literally
        rock your world.

03:17.932 --> 03:21.767
   But I'm gonna stay at home
      and never see that.

03:25.905 --> 03:27.272
        [dryer whirring]

03:27.274 --> 03:28.640
            - Girl.

03:30.878 --> 03:36.548
[tv show continues indistinctly]

03:38.351 --> 03:39.551
             - Hi.
             - Hi.

03:39.553 --> 03:41.653
      - I need your help.
     - What is on your ear?

03:41.655 --> 03:44.590
   - Oh, hugh's demonstrating
    how he tracked penguins.

03:44.592 --> 03:46.225
         He and marcus
    are looking for a mate,

03:46.227 --> 03:47.659
  And I'm the eligible female.

03:47.661 --> 03:50.262
  - It is mind-boggling to me

03:50.264 --> 03:53.665
    - Marcus so badly wants
  to connect with his father,

03:53.667 --> 03:56.735
    And you know, with hugh,
  it's all about the penguins.

03:56.737 --> 03:58.337
      - Why don't you just
     say something to him?

03:58.339 --> 04:00.472
   - Can you please just come
  to the penguin presentation

04:00.474 --> 04:02.307
And just steer the conversation?

04:02.309 --> 04:03.308
          - No can do.

04:03.310 --> 04:05.978
  That sam may get out of work
          early today,

04:05.980 --> 04:07.412
        And if she does,
      we're gonna finally

04:07.414 --> 04:08.614
  Consummate our relationship,

04:08.616 --> 04:09.748
   You know, sexually, so...

04:09.750 --> 04:11.717
             - Oh.
     Excellent, excellent.

04:11.719 --> 04:16.321
       Well, do you think
 you could reschedule the sex?

04:16.322 --> 04:18.557
     You know, for marcus?

04:18.559 --> 04:20.291
 - Are you seriously asking me

04:20.293 --> 04:22.961
      To choose a penguin
    powerpoint presentation

04:22.963 --> 04:24.296
Over sex with a beautiful woman?

04:24.298 --> 04:25.397
    What is wrong with you?

04:25.399 --> 04:26.632
           - I mean,
    to help a wonderful boy

04:26.634 --> 04:28.700
    Connect with his father,
       who he barely sees

04:28.702 --> 04:30.702
  Twice a year if he's lucky.

04:30.704 --> 04:32.938
           - [sighs]
          okay, fine.

04:32.940 --> 04:34.640
 I'm gonna tell you something,
           all right?

04:34.642 --> 04:37.342
        If there's even
 a small faint hint of a whiff

04:37.344 --> 04:38.610
 That sam is getting off early,

04:38.612 --> 04:39.811
         I am so gone.

04:39.813 --> 04:40.846
       - Okay, thank you.

04:40.848 --> 04:42.848
   And if it's not pushing it
            too far,

04:42.850 --> 04:46.051
   For hugh to stay with you
      over at your place?

04:46.053 --> 04:47.352
           - Too far!
    What is wrong with you?

04:47.354 --> 04:48.754
      - Okay, okay, okay.
            Listen.

04:48.756 --> 04:50.489
   I can't be alone with him.

04:50.491 --> 04:52.057
      If we are left alone
       in the same space,

04:52.059 --> 04:57.062
           I succumb
 to such intense carnal desire.

04:57.064 --> 05:00.065
 - No, wait, wait, wait, wait.
         - I just ate.

05:00.067 --> 05:02.334
     - It's very confusing
          for marcus.

05:02.336 --> 05:05.037
        - And get this,
a penguin can expel their waste

05:05.039 --> 05:07.306
      Up to 40 centimeters
         from the nest.

05:07.308 --> 05:09.541
     That's like you and me
 shooting our poop for 5 feet.

05:09.543 --> 05:10.542
            [laughs]

05:10.544 --> 05:11.543
            - Cool.

05:11.545 --> 05:12.778
           - [gasps]

05:12.780 --> 05:14.079
         There she is.

05:14.081 --> 05:15.347
          The female.

05:15.349 --> 05:16.415
          - Oh, hugh.

05:16.417 --> 05:19.785
- I will make you mine, female.

05:19.787 --> 05:22.854
     [grunting, shivering]

05:25.591 --> 05:27.092
             May I?
           - You may.

05:27.094 --> 05:28.327
    - [grunting, shivering]

05:28.329 --> 05:30.095
           - [moans]

05:30.097 --> 05:31.663
             - Wow.

05:31.665 --> 05:35.334
            Finally
  we're a normal family again.

05:35.336 --> 05:38.370
          [shivering]

05:41.974 --> 05:42.407
               .

05:42.409 --> 05:45.877
  - [gasps] there's lewis and
the other members of his rookery

05:45.879 --> 05:48.080
          Just gazing
   upon the antarctic tundra.

05:48.082 --> 05:49.781
     Oh, I just love that.

05:49.783 --> 05:51.350
     Sometimes I just like
       to stand with him

05:51.352 --> 05:52.718
       And try to imagine
      what he's thinking.

05:52.720 --> 05:53.952
          - You know,
     I bet he's just happy

05:53.954 --> 05:55.120
   To be there with you, dad.

05:55.122 --> 05:56.788
          - Actually,
     penguins are incapable

05:56.790 --> 05:58.824
         Of developing
emotional attachment to humans.

05:58.826 --> 06:00.592
       Next slide, fifi.

06:00.594 --> 06:01.593
              Aw!

06:01.595 --> 06:03.762
            [laughs]

06:03.764 --> 06:05.630
     Now, this is winchell.
           Winchell.

06:05.632 --> 06:06.965
    Now, notice his pallor.

06:06.967 --> 06:09.668
       He's what we call
      a leucistic penguin,

06:09.670 --> 06:11.436
        Which is kind of
     a polite way of saying

06:11.438 --> 06:12.604
       He's a freak show.

06:12.606 --> 06:13.638
     He's a social misfit.

06:13.640 --> 06:14.806
        He's an outcast.

06:14.808 --> 06:16.608
  Now, can you feel the anger

06:16.610 --> 06:18.143
    The other penguins have
          towards him?

06:18.145 --> 06:21.446
  He will eventually be driven
   from the colony and eaten.

06:21.448 --> 06:23.048
            - Eaten?
    - That's nature, marcus.

06:23.050 --> 06:24.916
       Next slide, fifi.

06:24.918 --> 06:26.518
              Oh.

06:26.520 --> 06:27.619
          What's this?

06:27.621 --> 06:29.688
    - I wonder how that got
           in there.

06:29.690 --> 06:32.758
     Well, anyway, it's me,
   practicing for field day,

06:32.760 --> 06:33.825
     Which is on earth day.

06:33.827 --> 06:34.926
    I got assigned baseball,

06:34.928 --> 06:36.928
      But I kind of suck.

06:36.930 --> 06:38.764
    - He's a little nervous
           about it,

06:38.766 --> 06:42.801
  - Hugh, maybe you could help
   marcus with his baseball.

06:42.803 --> 06:44.903
        - Fifi, you know
    sports aren't my forte.

06:44.905 --> 06:47.706
       Next slide, fifi.

06:50.443 --> 06:52.811
    Hmm, why do you want me
         to sleep here?

06:52.813 --> 06:56.715
- It's the firmest sleep surface
     in both of our places,

06:56.717 --> 06:59.451
         Which is best
       for your sciatica.

06:59.453 --> 07:00.819
          - All right,
      bathroom's upstairs,

07:00.821 --> 07:03.155
       And extra blankets
       are up there too.

07:03.157 --> 07:05.891
  - I don't need any blankets.

07:05.893 --> 07:07.459
       I'm a hot sleeper.

07:07.461 --> 07:09.761
    - You always have been.

07:09.763 --> 07:12.197
            [moans]

07:12.199 --> 07:16.668
          - [groaning]

07:17.637 --> 07:19.037
       - Good night, all.
           - Mm-hmm.

07:19.039 --> 07:20.705
         - Good night.

07:20.707 --> 07:22.574
       - Kee kee kee kee
        kee kee kee kee.

07:22.576 --> 07:23.575
   - All right, dude, well--

07:23.577 --> 07:25.143
          Oh, my god!

07:25.145 --> 07:28.013
       - I like to sleep
      as the penguins do.

07:28.015 --> 07:30.048
     - Just keep your beak
off my leather, all right, man?

07:30.050 --> 07:31.550
        - Nose or penis?

07:31.552 --> 07:32.851
           - [groans]

07:32.853 --> 07:34.920
           - [sighs]

07:38.057 --> 07:39.825
            [groans]

07:42.728 --> 07:43.795
       - ¶ a man's man ¶

07:43.797 --> 07:47.833
           ¶ some say
       that's what I am ¶

07:47.835 --> 07:51.903
      ¶ but it don't feel
           that way ¶

07:51.905 --> 07:55.807
        ¶ and I still do
          what I can ¶

07:55.809 --> 07:57.642
           ¶ I try ¶

07:57.644 --> 07:59.478
         ¶ I've tried ¶

07:59.480 --> 08:04.683
       ¶ I'm still trying
       to make you see ¶

08:04.685 --> 08:05.750
           - [sighs]

08:05.752 --> 08:09.721
         That is nice.
            [grunts]

08:09.723 --> 08:11.490
     - ¶ if you can forget
          about him ¶

08:11.492 --> 08:12.491
  ¶ you can forget about me ¶

08:12.493 --> 08:14.493
          - [murmurs]

08:14.495 --> 08:17.562
       [knocking at door]

08:19.932 --> 08:23.768
 - Um, do you want to get that
             or...

08:23.770 --> 08:26.938
           [murmurs]

08:26.940 --> 08:28.640
          - [screams]
           - [yelps]

08:28.642 --> 08:29.774
        - What the hell
      are you doing, man?

08:29.776 --> 08:31.076
            - What?
            - Dude!

08:31.078 --> 08:32.644
    This is not cool, dude!

08:32.645 --> 08:34.044
           Not cool!
             - Why?

08:34.047 --> 08:35.013
           - Uncool!

08:35.015 --> 08:36.014
            - What?

08:36.015 --> 08:37.716
      [knocking continues]

08:37.717 --> 08:39.251
            - Will.

08:39.253 --> 08:43.121
    - The most amazing thing
  happened in the e.R. Today.

08:43.123 --> 08:45.657
     Cardiac arrest patient
   comes in dead on arrival.

08:45.659 --> 08:46.791
   I mean, this guy is gone.

08:46.793 --> 08:48.627
  So I grab the defib paddles,

08:48.629 --> 08:52.597
 Heartbeat. Back from the dead.
     - Wow, that's amazing.

08:52.599 --> 08:53.765
- I know, it was so incredible.

08:53.767 --> 08:56.167
         The only thing
       I could think was,

08:56.169 --> 08:59.104
  "I can't wait to tell will."

08:59.106 --> 09:00.105
            - I--oh.

09:00.107 --> 09:01.106
         [both moaning]

09:01.108 --> 09:02.641
             Look--

09:02.643 --> 09:04.543
 - I know my schedule is crazy

09:04.545 --> 09:06.044
        And you're doing
   the whole gentleman thing

09:06.046 --> 09:07.712
       Wanting the timing
    to be right for us to...

09:07.714 --> 09:08.713
           You know.

09:08.715 --> 09:09.748
           - Mm-hmm.

09:09.750 --> 09:11.850
    - But I'm on such a high
           right now.

09:11.852 --> 09:13.785
   I mean, the guy was dead.

09:13.787 --> 09:14.786
   - You reanimated someone.

09:14.788 --> 09:16.655
            I mean,
    that's incredibly sexy.

09:16.657 --> 09:17.889
     - What I'm saying is,

09:17.891 --> 09:19.691
       I know the moment
      hasn't been perfect,

09:19.693 --> 09:23.662
    But, um, maybe we could
    make the moment perfect.

09:23.664 --> 09:25.764
          - Yes. Yes.
           - Mm? Mmm.

09:27.633 --> 09:29.634
         [quirky music]

09:29.636 --> 09:32.971
             - Ah.

09:32.973 --> 09:33.972
            - Hello.

09:33.974 --> 09:36.908
          - Oh, hello.

09:36.910 --> 09:40.111
  Will, something in your bed
      is giving me a rash.

09:43.716 --> 09:43.949
               .

09:43.951 --> 09:46.251
          - I'm sorry,
          you're who?

09:46.253 --> 09:47.252
   - Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

09:47.254 --> 09:49.588
            Not who.
             Hugh.

09:49.590 --> 09:50.922
     Oh, I love that joke.

09:50.924 --> 09:53.058
     I am marcus's father.
             - Ah.

09:53.060 --> 09:56.061
    - And it is just a charm
          to meet you.

09:56.063 --> 09:57.162
        - This is hugh.

09:57.164 --> 09:59.197
         Hugh is the--
      he's rooming with me

09:59.199 --> 10:00.198
      Just a couple days.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.199
             It's--
             - oh.

10:01.201 --> 10:03.134
            - Yeah.
             Yeah.

10:03.136 --> 10:05.337
     Hey, will, even though
   your bed gives me a rash,

10:05.339 --> 10:09.007
    So do you think you guys
  could do the deed down here?

10:09.009 --> 10:10.275
          I apologize
     if the couch is damp.

10:10.277 --> 10:11.710
       I get very sweaty.

10:11.712 --> 10:12.911
       - [clears throat]

10:12.913 --> 10:14.245
     Yeah, you know, I'm--
         I'm gonna go.

10:14.247 --> 10:16.047
         - I--I--yeah.
 - Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no.

10:16.049 --> 10:17.749
            - Yeah.

10:17.751 --> 10:19.351
             - Oh,
   it was lovely meeting you.

10:19.353 --> 10:20.952
      - Oh, it was lovely
          meeting you.

10:20.954 --> 10:23.355
      - You are gorgeous.

10:23.357 --> 10:26.858
            - I--I--
           - [sighs]

10:26.860 --> 10:27.993
              Mm.

10:27.995 --> 10:31.129
     - Oh, why'd she leave?

10:31.131 --> 10:33.164
       - All right, dude.
      Listen to me, okay?

10:33.166 --> 10:36.201
 Your pants stay on your body.
 Your body stays on the couch.

10:36.203 --> 10:37.869
         You got that?
        - You're upset.

10:37.871 --> 10:39.137
     - I am a little upset.

10:39.139 --> 10:40.171
  - We need an open dialogue.

10:40.173 --> 10:42.374
  - You want an open dialogue?
            - I do.

10:42.376 --> 10:43.675
   - Let's talk about marcus.

10:43.677 --> 10:45.176
    There's nothing that kid
           wants more

10:45.178 --> 10:47.078
Than to spend some quality time
        with you, okay?

10:47.080 --> 10:48.380
       Time with his dad.

10:48.382 --> 10:51.916
   Time that doesn't involve
      speaking in penguin.

10:51.918 --> 10:53.718
         So if you want
       to make him happy,

10:53.720 --> 10:56.021
       Help him get ready
         for field day.

10:56.023 --> 10:58.056
 It's the most important thing
     in his life right now.

11:05.064 --> 11:06.097
     - Good morning, will.
           - [yawns]

11:06.099 --> 11:07.332
   - I'm just helping my dad
            soak up

11:07.334 --> 11:09.067
    Some medically necessary
           sunshine.

11:09.069 --> 11:12.237
       - So here we are,
spending quality time together.

11:12.239 --> 11:13.738
              Yes!

11:13.740 --> 11:15.407
      - Shouldn't you guys
         be practicing?

11:15.409 --> 11:17.108
    You know, for field day?

11:17.110 --> 11:19.310
 - I know you're worried about
my son getting humiliated, will,

11:19.312 --> 11:20.845
  But I told him not to worry.

11:20.847 --> 11:22.914
  - You know what, dad told me
    there's no embarrassment

11:22.916 --> 11:25.250
    In failing at something
as meaningless as a ball sport.

11:25.252 --> 11:27.085
          Right, dad?
             - Yep.

11:27.087 --> 11:28.987
      - Whoa. Whoa, whoa,
    whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:28.989 --> 11:32.257
   The real measure of a man
   can't be determined by his

11:32.259 --> 11:34.192
           [drawling]
       athletic ability.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.093
            - What?

11:35.095 --> 11:36.094
           - Oh, my.

11:36.096 --> 11:37.796
           No shirt.

11:37.798 --> 11:39.798
  - Can I speak to you please?

11:39.800 --> 11:40.965
            - Fifi.

11:40.967 --> 11:43.134
 - We have a serious situation
            outside.

11:43.136 --> 11:45.303
      He just told marcus
 that ball sports don't matter.

11:45.305 --> 11:46.938
        - Yeah, I know,
      but they're talking,

11:46.940 --> 11:48.173
  Which is far more important.

11:48.175 --> 11:49.774
    - Field day is tomorrow.

11:49.776 --> 11:51.776
       He needs to learn
    some basic ball skills.

11:51.778 --> 11:55.180
   - Will, out there is a boy
so eager to connect with his dad

11:55.182 --> 11:58.483
 That he's willing to actually
    sit in direct sunlight.

11:58.485 --> 12:00.785
- All right, well, he shouldn't
have to sit in direct sunlight,

12:00.787 --> 12:02.954
   Nor should he have to play
            playtime

12:02.956 --> 12:04.956
 With a bag of airline peanuts.

12:04.958 --> 12:05.957
          - It's fine.
          Don't worry.

12:05.959 --> 12:09.027
         - Okay, well,
  you can choose to ignore it,

12:09.029 --> 12:10.995
   But I'm not gonna pretend
    like it's not total crap

12:10.997 --> 12:12.931
      That marcus's father
  doesn't know his kid at all.

12:12.933 --> 12:14.466
  - Will, you don't understand
         the situation

12:14.468 --> 12:15.967
  Because you're not a parent.

12:15.969 --> 12:17.368
       - Yeah, all right.

12:17.370 --> 12:22.140
       I don't understand
         the situation.

12:22.142 --> 12:24.209
      If you want marcus's
   relationship with his dad

12:24.211 --> 12:26.444
       To improve at all,

12:26.446 --> 12:29.180
   You got to say something.

12:29.182 --> 12:31.449
      But what do I know?
       I'm not a parent.

12:40.493 --> 12:43.361
   - Oh, hugh, he's out there
  playing baseball by himself.

12:43.363 --> 12:45.163
    - I invited him to watch
       this penguin feed

12:45.165 --> 12:47.465
     - He's not interested
          in penguins.

12:47.467 --> 12:50.101
          He's nervous
      about his field day.

12:50.103 --> 12:51.402
      - Why are you being
         so difficult?

12:51.404 --> 12:53.004
    You're never like this.

12:53.006 --> 12:57.842
      - I don't understand
  how you can take no interest

12:57.844 --> 12:59.110
      In your son's life.

12:59.112 --> 13:00.478
          - [scoffing]
          no interest?

13:00.480 --> 13:02.347
          My sacrifice
  was for the good of science.

13:02.349 --> 13:04.015
     - Oh, you want to talk
        about penguins.

13:04.017 --> 13:06.084
        Let's talk about
    that pale little bugger.

13:06.086 --> 13:08.186
       The one that looks
      a bit like a fetus.

13:08.188 --> 13:11.055
       All that was left
    was a beak and one foot.

13:11.057 --> 13:15.260
      Marcus will be lucky
  if those children leave him

13:15.262 --> 13:16.261
    With a beak and a foot.

13:16.263 --> 13:20.098
       He needs his dad.

13:20.100 --> 13:22.433
    - It's been a long time
  since one of our arguments.

13:22.435 --> 13:24.302
          As I recall,

13:24.304 --> 13:27.105
     They often led to, um,

13:27.107 --> 13:29.140
           Intimacy.

13:29.142 --> 13:31.176
  - Hugh, while you're here...

13:31.178 --> 13:32.177
           - Mm-hmm.

13:32.179 --> 13:33.211
   - Please, can you just try

13:33.213 --> 13:34.579
       And be a good dad?
