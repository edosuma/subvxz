WEBVTT

02:06.960 --> 02:07.961
Shit.

02:45.832 --> 02:49.920
Jiam Quarver, you have suffered
a cervical spinal cord injury.

02:50.003 --> 02:55.425
In a few moments you will suffocate,
unless we intervene.

02:55.926 --> 02:59.221
We know you operate
this illicit biohacking facility.

02:59.304 --> 03:04.184
We also know you manufactured
the two subcutaneous nano-lace explosives

03:04.268 --> 03:06.979
used by the bombers
who destroyed the Star Bridge.

03:12.192 --> 03:15.863
Now, what we don't know is
the identity of the people

03:15.946 --> 03:18.824
who contracted with your lab
to have this work done.

03:22.411 --> 03:26.623
The device my associate is applying
will stimulate your phrenic nerves

03:26.707 --> 03:28.834
and allow you to breathe again.

03:28.917 --> 03:33.881
The next words you utter will determine
if that device remains functioning.

03:34.631 --> 03:39.011
So, who purchased the bombs?

03:41.346 --> 03:44.308
We've questioned thousands
of persons of interest,

03:44.391 --> 03:46.852
but the chain of intermediaries
linking the bomb maker

03:46.935 --> 03:50.105
to the attack's true authors
has proven intractable.

03:51.732 --> 03:55.235
How many bodies
are still orbiting Trantor?

03:55.319 --> 03:57.946
127,000, Empire.

03:58.864 --> 04:00.949
Why haven't they been retrieved?

04:01.033 --> 04:04.995
It hasn't been the highest priority.
Rescue and recovery have--

04:05.078 --> 04:06.622
Make it a priority.

04:06.705 --> 04:09.625
The corpses have been catching fire
as they reenter the atmosphere.

04:09.708 --> 04:12.711
All anyone has to do is look up
to be reminded of our impotence.

04:12.794 --> 04:14.630
We need results.

04:14.713 --> 04:17.507
We need certainty, Brother.

04:24.640 --> 04:27.851
Am I going to regret
exiling Seldon and his followers?

04:28.685 --> 04:30.896
No evidence links them to the attack.

04:31.772 --> 04:33.732
No evidence exonerates them.

04:36.944 --> 04:39.738
I could destroy them still,
even at a distance.

04:41.114 --> 04:42.616
We could say they did it.

04:43.450 --> 04:46.411
Every source of news could say it
every hour on the hour

04:46.495 --> 04:49.998
until the air is made of that
and there's nothing else to breathe.

04:50.582 --> 04:53.293
Martyring dissidents is
a risky enterprise.

04:55.754 --> 04:57.756
So is annoying your emperor.

05:37.838 --> 05:43.010
86,981,597.

05:44.386 --> 05:50.350
86,981,689.

05:52.352 --> 05:57.608
86,981,717.

05:59.693 --> 06:05.365
86,981,729.

06:12.122 --> 06:13.332
Figured I'd find you here.

06:14.249 --> 06:15.375
Sorry.

06:16.668 --> 06:18.378
Didn't mean to wake you.

06:18.462 --> 06:22.508
-You were counting primes in your sleep.
-How far did I get?

06:23.008 --> 06:25.385
Not the end,
if that's what you're hoping for.

06:26.595 --> 06:30.349
-There is no end.
-Numbers or problems to count?

06:30.974 --> 06:33.310
We don't have to colonize
the whole planet, Gaal.

06:34.144 --> 06:35.687
Just our own tiny corner.

06:38.565 --> 06:40.609
There are no corners on a sphere.

06:44.363 --> 06:45.572
You coming out?

06:46.281 --> 06:48.200
No. Come in.

06:50.953 --> 06:52.454
You know I can't swim.

06:52.538 --> 06:54.873
You've got four years
and four months to learn.

06:54.957 --> 06:56.041
Not a chance.

07:02.214 --> 07:06.510
Relax, relax, relax. I've got you.

07:10.389 --> 07:12.474
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

08:01.023 --> 08:03.525
Performance was unacceptable…

08:05.861 --> 08:07.362
Blue Team's tanking.

08:09.406 --> 08:13.076
When the time comes,
fly Red or Green is my hint to you.

08:14.620 --> 08:17.331
Maybe I'll join the reactor group
next training period.

08:17.414 --> 08:19.499
Hmm, soup was a little cold
at dinner last night.

08:19.583 --> 08:21.627
Maybe you wanna do
a couple of weeks in culinary as well?

08:21.710 --> 08:22.878
I understand your point--

08:22.961 --> 08:25.255
You don't have to learn
every job in the colony, Gaal.

08:25.339 --> 08:28.425
Well, I do if they can't do them.

08:29.426 --> 08:33.388
We have, what, 54 more months
until we land on Terminus.

08:33.472 --> 08:36.015
We have time. A lot of time.

08:36.099 --> 08:38.519
Well, we do until we don't.

08:45.067 --> 08:47.945
Sorry. I shouldn't be wasting
our dwindling time like that.

08:49.071 --> 08:51.365
When will you stop
taking me so seriously?

09:29.236 --> 09:32.197
Shivaughn, I'm picking up high levels
of mercury and arsenic there.

09:32.281 --> 09:33.282
Just be careful.

09:34.992 --> 09:37.578
Try and seal that seam quickly.
It's toxic.

09:37.661 --> 09:38.745
I'm on it.

09:56.930 --> 09:58.557
Hello?

10:07.482 --> 10:08.567
Shit.

10:10.861 --> 10:12.029
Run, Shivaughn!

10:15.908 --> 10:16.742
Shit! Stay down.

10:16.825 --> 10:18.035
No, Abbas!

10:26.627 --> 10:29.963
Congratulations,
you guys are zero for three.

10:31.173 --> 10:34.510
Because you were in the primary
blast radius, Gaal and Shivaughn,

10:34.593 --> 10:38.388
both of you suffered from overpressure
to your hollow organs.

10:38.472 --> 10:42.559
I could try, but I doubt
I could find a more painful way to die.

10:43.185 --> 10:46.104
Mari, Briwan, Abbas.

10:46.188 --> 10:47.314
Uh-huh?

10:47.397 --> 10:50.359
You were all killed
by exploded rock fragments.

10:50.442 --> 10:52.486
The good news, it was instant.

10:53.111 --> 10:55.155
The bad news, you're still dead.

10:55.239 --> 10:57.824
Better than that thing tearing us apart.

10:57.908 --> 10:59.618
Yeah, what the hell was that?

10:59.701 --> 11:03.372
A bishop's claw. Local megafauna,
endemic to the Outer Reach.

11:04.206 --> 11:07.084
But Abbas is right. The sim's unfair.

11:07.167 --> 11:10.295
If he hadn't fired, the bishop's claw
would've probably killed us all anyway.

11:10.379 --> 11:12.673
Yes, it is unfair.

11:13.173 --> 11:15.801
Everything about Terminus is unfair.

11:16.844 --> 11:20.848
But we need to defy those odds
if the Foundation is to succeed.

11:20.931 --> 11:22.724
We'll try again at 0600 tomorrow.

11:23.433 --> 11:26.478
Ms. Dornick, Dr. Seldon wants to see you.

11:41.493 --> 11:43.871
There's an apple orchard
in the Imperial Gardens

11:43.954 --> 11:46.331
that's older than the Robot Wars.

11:47.499 --> 11:50.335
They used to hang AI sympathizers there.

11:50.419 --> 11:52.462
I didn't know there were
robot sympathizers.

11:52.546 --> 11:54.882
There are always sympathizers.

11:54.965 --> 11:58.886
Well, hopefully, by the end of this trip,

11:58.969 --> 12:01.221
this one will be strong enough
to hang somebody.

12:02.097 --> 12:03.182
Hopefully.

12:05.142 --> 12:07.269
You had trouble with the lava tube.

12:07.352 --> 12:09.062
We always have trouble with the lava tube.

12:09.855 --> 12:11.023
What's your solution?

12:11.106 --> 12:13.233
Don't settle the Foundation
near the lava tube.

12:13.317 --> 12:14.526
We need it for energy production.

12:14.610 --> 12:17.571
We need people to drill wells
for geothermal energy.

12:18.280 --> 12:21.325
And we won't have any
if unstable veins keep igniting.

12:21.408 --> 12:22.618
Mm-hmm.

12:23.869 --> 12:25.495
-It's bitter.
-But alive.

12:27.456 --> 12:30.334
Have you run thrive projections
using this morning's sim data?

12:30.417 --> 12:33.212
-Yeah.
-Including Blue Team's catastrophe?

12:33.712 --> 12:36.882
34.2% mortality
after five years' planetfall.

12:36.965 --> 12:40.552
Trending downwards. Optimism abounds.

12:40.636 --> 12:42.596
Tell that to the 1,710 people on--

12:42.679 --> 12:45.098
That's the reason we run sims, Gaal.

12:45.182 --> 12:47.392
-Morning, Hari.
-Morning, Magnus.

12:49.269 --> 12:50.479
"Hari."

12:51.688 --> 12:54.775
I was "Dr. Seldon"
when we began this journey.

12:55.484 --> 12:57.653
Is that really such a bad thing?

12:59.196 --> 13:01.281
For them to know the man behind the math?

13:02.866 --> 13:05.494
There's a Foundation
budget allocation conference later.

13:05.577 --> 13:07.871
-I need you to sit in for me.
-I've never gone--

13:07.955 --> 13:09.414
It's just numbers, Gaal.

13:11.250 --> 13:12.376
It's just numbers.

13:13.460 --> 13:14.461
Yeah.

13:46.285 --> 13:48.787
Math is never just numbers.

13:50.163 --> 13:54.543
When words fail us,
we use math to describe the inexpressible.

13:55.669 --> 13:57.838
The things that terrify us most.

13:59.131 --> 14:01.216
The vastness of space,

14:02.217 --> 14:04.136
the shape of time…

14:06.096 --> 14:08.515
the weight and worth of a human soul.

14:44.968 --> 14:47.846
That's an old Anacreon
hunting song, isn't it?

14:47.930 --> 14:51.892
You invoke it before
you kill the animal. Yes?

14:53.185 --> 14:55.103
Anyone could sing that, Emperor.

14:55.187 --> 14:56.605
That's not true.

14:58.148 --> 15:02.569
We've tried to sing your songs
as part of our education.

15:03.320 --> 15:06.198
Never mastered the dialect.
Not like a native.

15:06.281 --> 15:10.118
But it sounds perfect, doesn't it?

15:10.744 --> 15:13.080
As we have for the last two weeks,

15:13.163 --> 15:16.166
Anacreon firmly denies
any involvement in this--

15:17.251 --> 15:19.044
I cannot find words for it.

15:19.127 --> 15:21.255
The words are the destruction
of the Star Bridge

15:21.338 --> 15:24.341
and the deaths
of 100 million citizens of Trantor.

15:30.681 --> 15:33.934
That was Thespin, wasn't it?

15:34.434 --> 15:35.644
Can you translate?

15:38.605 --> 15:39.606
Louder!

15:40.858 --> 15:42.442
It means, "Long live the Outer Reach."

15:42.526 --> 15:44.945
I assume you can also recognize
the Thespin prayer heard

15:45.028 --> 15:48.740
right before bombs ripped
the orbital platform from the stalk.

15:48.824 --> 15:51.660
With all due respect, Empire,
that prayer--

15:51.743 --> 15:54.997
Hasn't been sung in 88 years.

15:55.080 --> 15:56.999
No Thespin would sing--

16:01.461 --> 16:03.255
My government continues to deny--

16:04.590 --> 16:05.924
Shroud them.

16:10.554 --> 16:13.849
What's on the recording is authentic.
They don't have answers.

16:14.641 --> 16:15.893
Someone does.

16:17.102 --> 16:19.605
These worlds hate each other.

16:20.480 --> 16:24.109
-More than they hate the Empire?
-Historically, yes.

16:24.193 --> 16:28.280
The idea they'd collaborate
on such a thing…

16:28.363 --> 16:29.573
And yet…

16:32.576 --> 16:35.495
someone's going to hang for this.

16:40.751 --> 16:42.878
I'd like it to be the guilty one.

17:00.354 --> 17:01.939
Where is Brother Dusk?

17:20.874 --> 17:22.084
Ooh.

17:23.752 --> 17:24.752
Ugh.

18:41.330 --> 18:44.082
Okay. Thanks, Gaal.

18:46.001 --> 18:47.336
Zygote looks good.

18:56.428 --> 18:58.138
Any change in your birth directive?

18:59.640 --> 19:00.641
No.

19:03.977 --> 19:05.229
People talk to me.

19:06.396 --> 19:09.149
-I'm sure.
-Well, not just here, but out there.

19:11.068 --> 19:13.487
'Cause not everyone wants
to wait for planetfall.

19:13.570 --> 19:14.905
That's not surprising.

19:19.952 --> 19:21.119
If I knew someone--

19:22.412 --> 19:23.830
She's still early-term.

19:24.331 --> 19:26.875
She could still follow protocol,
but she won't come in.

19:28.669 --> 19:33.131
Do I need to tell Dr. Seldon?
Or is it enough just to tell you?

19:43.976 --> 19:45.519
Everything check out okay?

19:46.103 --> 19:47.271
Everything's fine.

19:49.982 --> 19:50.983
Find you later?

19:52.359 --> 19:53.402
Okay.

20:01.702 --> 20:04.913
Attention. Quadrant five is now clear.

20:04.997 --> 20:07.124
Quadrant five, all clear.

20:11.962 --> 20:15.340
Tell Dr. Seldon we're running
an extra reactor sim tonight.

20:15.424 --> 20:17.843
Hopefully we won't radiate
all three shuttles this time.

20:17.926 --> 20:20.137
I'm not here about that.

20:23.140 --> 20:24.183
Does the father know?

20:24.933 --> 20:26.310
We barely know each other.

20:26.393 --> 20:29.563
He seems sweet,
but I don't care much what he thinks.

20:29.646 --> 20:31.315
Do you care what anyone thinks?

20:31.398 --> 20:34.401
Enough to talk to Shivaughn
at the seed bank.

20:34.484 --> 20:35.861
Look where that got me.

20:36.403 --> 20:38.906
I'm not talking to you as the Foundation.

20:38.989 --> 20:40.657
I'm talking to you as Gaal.

20:42.159 --> 20:44.870
Lowre, you're an engineer.

20:44.953 --> 20:46.663
You tested onto the shuttle team.

20:46.747 --> 20:49.958
You know how much safer
an embryo is in the seed bank.

20:51.168 --> 20:54.713
This ship wasn't designed for pregnancy.

20:54.796 --> 20:56.381
And Terminus is?

20:56.465 --> 20:58.008
I'm not stupid.

20:58.091 --> 21:00.594
I know how much radiation
we're getting hit with up here.

21:00.677 --> 21:03.138
I know the odds of carrying
healthy to term, and defects,

21:03.222 --> 21:04.973
and my milk being poison.

21:05.474 --> 21:07.017
But I also know where we're going.

21:08.060 --> 21:11.605
Frozen rock, long nights,
no trees for shelter.

21:12.105 --> 21:15.067
I know you've got projections
of how many of us are going to die,

21:15.150 --> 21:17.402
and that the number is higher
than anyone wants to admit.

21:17.486 --> 21:19.404
-Lowre, that's not true.
-No one wants to tell--

21:19.488 --> 21:20.364
Don't lie to me!

21:20.447 --> 21:24.868
It's okay for Hari Seldon to lie to me.
I expect that, but not from you.

21:25.827 --> 21:27.704
Please just tell me the truth.

21:31.083 --> 21:34.044
That's how I know
it's you talking and not him.

21:35.462 --> 21:38.382
I know what the right thing
to do is, Gaal. I know.

21:39.758 --> 21:40.926
I know what the math is.

21:41.009 --> 21:43.804
I know that what we're doing
on this ship isn't really living.

21:44.596 --> 21:46.306
We're just preparing to live.

21:47.683 --> 21:49.184
For some of us to live.

21:50.310 --> 21:51.728
It's the Plan.

21:53.021 --> 21:56.650
What if I let them take her out
and something happens,

21:56.733 --> 22:00.612
and I never get to feel her
grow inside me ever again?

22:01.196 --> 22:03.365
I'll just never get to look into her eyes.

22:05.742 --> 22:07.452
There would be nothing worse.

22:16.920 --> 22:19.339
-Brother Dusk.
-Good evening, Demerzel.

22:19.423 --> 22:21.049
Empire missed you in the throne room.

22:21.133 --> 22:22.551
I don't think so.

22:23.927 --> 22:26.722
-Where are you going?
-You know where.

22:56.627 --> 22:58.045
Gods.

23:14.186 --> 23:17.022
There. Put us down there.

23:29.868 --> 23:31.745
Upon awakening,

23:31.828 --> 23:37.209
may the Sleeper cleanse these eyes
of the evil they have seen.

23:41.588 --> 23:44.466
-Empire.
-Empire, please help us.

23:54.518 --> 23:56.436
Weapons left outside.

24:01.191 --> 24:02.359
I have no weapon.

24:03.151 --> 24:04.945
All of the weapons.

24:05.654 --> 24:08.490
-She has nothing.
-Not her. Him.

24:10.117 --> 24:12.911
His machines are not welcome here.

24:12.995 --> 24:13.912
Empire--

24:24.298 --> 24:29.219
He who shrouds himself from man's touch
shrouds himself from God.

24:29.803 --> 24:32.055
And so now am I touched by God?

24:32.139 --> 24:33.807
No. Just me.

24:34.308 --> 24:39.146
Empire, the structures are still settling.
We should return to the shuttle.

24:39.229 --> 24:42.983
Your stones. You use them to pray.

24:43.066 --> 24:46.820
We speak to the Sleeper,
and the Sleeper sees us.

24:46.904 --> 24:49.740
You claim to be seers, yes?
You know the future.

24:50.490 --> 24:53.619
The Sleeper dreams our future.

24:53.702 --> 24:56.747
What use would it be to guide our past?

24:56.830 --> 24:59.333
Why were you at Hari Seldon's trial?

24:59.416 --> 25:01.335
What is your interest in Gaal Dornick?

25:03.378 --> 25:05.464
Why do you care for her?

25:05.547 --> 25:08.258
There is no sin in curiosity.

25:08.342 --> 25:10.177
There is on your planet.

25:10.260 --> 25:12.971
-Empire, we must go.
-I understand now.

25:13.055 --> 25:16.266
He wants to know if she's a true seer.

25:16.767 --> 25:20.646
If she truly saw the fall Seldon spoke of.

25:20.729 --> 25:23.148
If her math allowed her to see this.

25:23.232 --> 25:26.026
She came here. I know she did.

25:26.109 --> 25:28.111
-What did you talk about?
-Empire.

25:28.779 --> 25:32.783
-Did your god tell her about the Empire?
-The Sleeper doesn't know her.

25:32.866 --> 25:36.370
-Empire. Come with us.
-She is not a seer. Your empire is doomed.

26:37.890 --> 26:40.976
The most advanced math
is like a sixth sense.

26:41.935 --> 26:45.731
The right calculation can allow us
to see over the horizon.

26:47.191 --> 26:51.278
And if we're lucky, it can help us
prepare for what comes next.

27:46.416 --> 27:50.712
86,981,767.

27:52.005 --> 27:56.134
86,981,771.

27:57.344 --> 28:01.265
86,981,779.

28:12.943 --> 28:14.862
You were down there a long time.

28:16.029 --> 28:17.030
Was I?

28:19.157 --> 28:22.744
I was beginning to worry that
you weren't ever going to come up.

28:24.204 --> 28:26.331
Why always in the dark?

28:26.999 --> 28:28.125
Why in the light?

28:29.376 --> 28:31.295
Shame grows in darkness.

28:33.046 --> 28:34.882
You've nothing to be ashamed about.

28:41.305 --> 28:45.058
Hari, is there something
you wanna talk about?

28:45.934 --> 28:49.813
The day I met you, I said to Raych…

28:51.648 --> 28:54.193
"She exceeds my expectations."

28:56.278 --> 28:57.613
You both do.

28:59.406 --> 29:03.202
You know, these last few months
have been a gift.

29:04.369 --> 29:06.705
I gambled on exile.

29:07.247 --> 29:10.250
I did my best
to engineer the outcome, but…

29:11.668 --> 29:15.255
I never expected that I would be
among the ship's occupants.

29:15.964 --> 29:17.090
What changed?

29:22.137 --> 29:24.598
Don't be late for the Foundation meeting.

29:24.681 --> 29:29.436
Five minutes early is three minutes late
to Lewis Pirenne.

29:36.985 --> 29:38.195
He knows about us.

29:38.278 --> 29:41.073
He's a psychohistorian.
He reads math, not minds.

29:41.156 --> 29:44.284
I read math too,
and I know exactly what you're thinking.

29:44.952 --> 29:47.287
You're afraid to tell him,
and you don't wanna talk about it.

29:47.371 --> 29:49.915
-We both agreed.
-You told me he wouldn't like it.

29:49.998 --> 29:52.626
-He wouldn't.
-Because he doesn't want us to be happy?

29:53.502 --> 29:55.838
Because he thinks
relationships are a distraction.

29:56.755 --> 29:59.424
If we factor out human relationships,
what are we trying to save?

29:59.508 --> 30:01.051
He's not saying we have to be robots.

30:01.134 --> 30:03.428
-He just thinks that you and I--
-So he's jealous then?

30:05.013 --> 30:06.473
The math's not complete.

30:07.266 --> 30:09.434
-What?
-The math.

30:09.518 --> 30:12.729
Hari's Plan. It's not all worked out.

30:12.813 --> 30:16.316
I saw it when I had the Prime Radiant.
I never mentioned it in the trial.

30:16.900 --> 30:21.488
It's close. I'm not saying it's not close,
but not everything is solved.

30:21.989 --> 30:24.116
It's like a puzzle with a thousand pieces.

30:24.199 --> 30:27.244
If a few are missing, you know with
a high probability what the picture is,

30:27.327 --> 30:29.830
but they're still missing.

30:29.913 --> 30:31.582
How many pieces are missing?

30:32.207 --> 30:34.042
Enough to make a different picture?

30:34.126 --> 30:35.669
I don't know. Maybe.

30:35.752 --> 30:37.212
Do you know where Dr. Seldon is?

30:37.880 --> 30:40.340
He's not coming.

30:41.049 --> 30:43.135
-I'm sitting in.
-All right.

30:44.219 --> 30:45.304
When you're ready.

30:56.982 --> 30:59.234
Mari, would you like
to bring us up to speed

30:59.318 --> 31:01.403
from the budget subcommittee?

31:01.486 --> 31:06.825
The subcommittee confirms assigning 5.6%
of the initial research and survey budget

31:06.909 --> 31:11.079
to the 3% of planets closest to Trantor.

31:11.163 --> 31:13.415
Is 5.6% a lot?

31:13.498 --> 31:15.417
It seems like a lot.

31:16.418 --> 31:20.088
I'm sorry. Is it okay to ask questions?

31:21.048 --> 31:22.049
Of course.

31:22.841 --> 31:24.927
But it's not the first time
that we have discussed

31:25.010 --> 31:27.095
where to begin our preservation work.

31:27.179 --> 31:31.350
Does the allocation algorithm weight
towards heterogeny,

31:31.433 --> 31:34.853
and if so, how is that measured?

31:35.854 --> 31:39.274
Diversity and variance are cornerstones
of the Foundation's mission.

31:39.358 --> 31:42.444
Those inner worlds represent
40 trillion people,

31:42.528 --> 31:44.947
300 planets,
over a hundred different languages.

31:45.030 --> 31:49.076
And we decide the allocations,
not a computer program.

31:49.159 --> 31:54.331
Point is, the allocations were developed
through the Foundation's values.

31:54.414 --> 31:55.415
Mm-hmm.

31:55.499 --> 31:59.753
So what we save
says everything about who we are.

31:59.837 --> 32:01.255
Of course.

32:01.755 --> 32:05.634
And what is the Foundation's
feeling about base ten?

32:06.844 --> 32:07.886
What do you mean?

32:07.970 --> 32:09.388
-Base ten.
-Mm-hmm?

32:09.471 --> 32:12.224
The numbering system,
one, two, three, four--

32:12.307 --> 32:13.475
We know what it is.

32:13.976 --> 32:15.060
Of course you do,

32:15.644 --> 32:17.729
because it's the math of Trantor

32:17.813 --> 32:21.358
and the math of almost every single system
in the inner 3% of the galaxy.

32:21.441 --> 32:24.236
I assume you aim to preserve it?

32:24.319 --> 32:26.780
It's how we count.

32:26.864 --> 32:28.615
It's how you count,

32:29.283 --> 32:30.534
and your neighbors.

32:31.994 --> 32:34.246
Will you be preserving base 12 or 27?

32:34.788 --> 32:36.665
Over a thousand worlds use base 12

32:36.748 --> 32:39.918
because 12 is cleanly divisible
by more factors than 10 is.

32:40.002 --> 32:42.546
300 systems use base 27.

32:43.172 --> 32:44.506
It comes from counting body parts.

32:44.590 --> 32:47.301
-What is your point?
-My point is,

32:47.384 --> 32:49.511
as we begin preserving the most…

32:50.596 --> 32:53.599
essential pieces of civilization,

32:54.558 --> 32:56.810
deciding what is remembered,

32:57.769 --> 32:59.188
what is forgotten…

33:02.024 --> 33:04.151
how will we know what those things are

33:05.194 --> 33:07.362
if we can't even agree
on how to count them?

34:34.241 --> 34:35.492
All right.

34:40.371 --> 34:41.373
Are you sure?

34:41.956 --> 34:44.418
-You still seem--
-You needn't worry about me.

34:45.127 --> 34:46.335
You could've died.

34:46.920 --> 34:49.464
I've managed not to for a long while now.

34:50.090 --> 34:51.967
You know I'm not the same as you.

34:53.427 --> 34:55.512
The rest of your kind died.

34:56.679 --> 35:01.476
They didn't die.
They were destroyed by your kind.

35:02.060 --> 35:03.270
It's different.

35:05.355 --> 35:07.900
Is that why you don't like me
to see how you really are?

35:09.401 --> 35:11.904
I don't like it because it's immodest.

35:12.404 --> 35:14.114
-But--
-The more human I act,

35:14.198 --> 35:15.824
the more human I am.

35:18.493 --> 35:21.163
It's confusing not
to commit to one reality.

35:33.133 --> 35:34.343
You're avoiding me.

35:34.927 --> 35:36.136
Hardly.

35:37.596 --> 35:39.598
You know I hate the stairs.

35:40.641 --> 35:42.351
You hate this.

35:43.143 --> 35:45.187
If I want to sentimentalize old emperors,

35:45.270 --> 35:47.731
I can just look across the dinner table.

35:50.526 --> 35:53.070
-I felt the same way when I was your age.
-Hmm.

35:56.865 --> 35:59.034
Can you imagine…

35:59.117 --> 36:03.413
the sheer hubris required to think
so much of your abilities, your mind,

36:03.497 --> 36:04.831
so much of your own heart,

36:04.915 --> 36:08.377
that you decide from now on,

36:09.086 --> 36:13.465
that not only will you be the first,
but the one?

36:14.341 --> 36:19.513
"I will be the river
from which all rivers flow."

36:19.596 --> 36:20.639
He was right.

36:20.722 --> 36:22.641
Of course. And yet here we are.

36:24.142 --> 36:28.230
Millions dead,
with a prophecy of trillions more.

36:28.313 --> 36:31.358
-Seldon is just a man.
-And so were we once.

36:31.441 --> 36:33.569
Why did you go to the Scar?

36:36.697 --> 36:37.948
Was it to see the priest?

36:39.449 --> 36:41.785
They're still pulling bodies
out of the wreckage.

36:43.245 --> 36:44.746
As they have been for weeks.

36:44.830 --> 36:47.291
I wanted to see what happened
to our world,

36:47.374 --> 36:49.334
as you should have as emperor.

36:49.418 --> 36:52.754
I am emperor.
At least you're honest about that.

36:59.469 --> 37:02.264
I want to meet
with the Anacreon and Thespin delegates.

37:02.347 --> 37:05.517
-It's not your job.
-No, but it is my right.

37:47.935 --> 37:49.228
It's not a trick.

37:49.978 --> 37:53.315
If it were,
there are lesser vintages to poison.

37:54.399 --> 37:55.400
To the future.

37:56.276 --> 37:57.903
May it be kind to all of us.

38:03.116 --> 38:04.409
What do you want?

38:04.993 --> 38:06.286
Only the truth.

38:06.370 --> 38:09.665
For weeks now,
we have been nothing but honest.

38:09.748 --> 38:14.044
Why would we sing an Anacreon song,
then deny it was us who had done so?

38:14.127 --> 38:16.088
The extremists amongst your ranks?

38:16.171 --> 38:18.715
You must admit it makes no sense.

38:18.799 --> 38:21.885
Or perhaps your government
has not told you everything.

38:22.886 --> 38:27.641
We have been loyal citizens
of the Imperium for 3,000 years.

38:28.267 --> 38:30.018
How would this profit Anacreon?

38:31.603 --> 38:35.899
Someone is trying to destroy us.

38:35.983 --> 38:39.278
Someone is punishing us to darkness.

38:40.028 --> 38:41.446
Please.

38:41.530 --> 38:42.531
Please.

38:44.616 --> 38:46.159
You're going to die.

38:46.910 --> 38:48.912
The Empire is going to kill you,

38:49.496 --> 38:52.457
and it won't be enough for what you did.

38:53.000 --> 38:56.295
For the smells.
For the stinging in the eyes.

38:57.504 --> 39:01.800
The dust of children,
mothers and fathers in our throats.

39:03.468 --> 39:07.222
It is a taste in my mouth!

39:16.356 --> 39:18.817
It is a taste that will not go away.

39:20.611 --> 39:25.449
This is the legacy. Yours and ours.

39:26.658 --> 39:28.410
We may wish it is not.

39:28.493 --> 39:32.331
We may scream it is not fair,
and we would be right.

39:34.416 --> 39:36.168
Because I believe you.

39:38.420 --> 39:40.130
One of you is telling the truth.

39:42.591 --> 39:44.134
Maybe even both.

39:51.808 --> 39:53.477
We should let you all go free.

39:58.065 --> 39:59.149
We should.

40:04.488 --> 40:05.656
But we won't.

40:16.208 --> 40:18.460
The old man is declining, isn't he?

40:29.930 --> 40:31.473
Dr. Seldon.

40:31.557 --> 40:34.309
Is something wrong?
Did we miss something from our delivery?

40:34.393 --> 40:39.857
No, no. I was just thinking
about a particular white shirt.

40:39.940 --> 40:42.526
It has an ink stain on the cuff.

40:42.609 --> 40:45.696
We haven't been able
to remove the stain yet.

40:45.779 --> 40:47.281
Is it clean otherwise?

40:47.364 --> 40:50.033
I'd like it if it is. Stain and all.

40:50.617 --> 40:52.286
Dr. Seldon?

40:54.288 --> 40:55.622
Yes?

40:55.706 --> 40:57.374
Can I ask you a question, sir?

40:57.958 --> 41:00.502
Of course. I've made a life out of it.

41:01.712 --> 41:04.756
-Are you happy?
-Happy?

41:05.507 --> 41:08.969
Happy with the progress of the Plan?
The preparations?

41:09.553 --> 41:10.679
What's your name?

41:12.014 --> 41:13.307
Veena.

41:13.390 --> 41:14.600
Veena.

41:17.019 --> 41:18.312
Veena Ahluwalia.

41:19.521 --> 41:22.316
Well, it's going to be
a long journey, Veena.

41:22.399 --> 41:25.319
We've faced challenges.
Many more will follow.

41:25.402 --> 41:30.699
But I am confident
in the success of our endeavor.

41:31.366 --> 41:34.828
And the principal reason for that is you.

41:36.538 --> 41:37.539
All of you.

41:38.248 --> 41:40.459
I approved the passenger manifest.

41:41.210 --> 41:44.338
Each and every name on it.

41:44.963 --> 41:47.341
A hundred years from now,

41:47.424 --> 41:53.680
perhaps even a thousand,
your names will be memorialized.

41:55.015 --> 41:57.976
The believers who threw their lot in
with an eccentric

41:58.560 --> 42:04.274
that pinned the fate of the galaxy
on the back of a theorem so abstract,

42:04.942 --> 42:05.943
well…

42:06.902 --> 42:08.820
it might as well have been a prayer.

42:09.696 --> 42:12.950
And it won't matter what you did,

42:14.284 --> 42:16.620
whether you worked
as an ultrasound scrubber,

42:16.703 --> 42:20.290
a heat exchange engineer
or here in the laundry.

42:21.375 --> 42:26.213
Because that prayer
can't endure without people.

42:27.798 --> 42:29.049
Without you.

42:30.300 --> 42:31.510
So…

42:33.762 --> 42:35.264
thank you, Veena.

42:36.765 --> 42:39.852
I'm sorry about the ink, sir.

42:40.435 --> 42:43.021
No matter. I'm used to it.

42:45.190 --> 42:46.775
It's a sign of hard work.

42:47.693 --> 42:48.777
Dr. Seldon?

42:49.319 --> 42:50.904
Yes, Theron?

42:51.530 --> 42:52.948
May I shake your hand?

42:57.327 --> 42:58.453
Thank you.

43:01.957 --> 43:04.543
-Thank you, Doctor.
-Thank you. Thank you.

43:05.919 --> 43:07.254
Thank you.

43:13.427 --> 43:15.304
I'm just saying he's not perfect.

43:15.888 --> 43:19.516
Abbas, how are we doing
with the 3D-printed metrics?

43:19.600 --> 43:20.934
We've been working with clay…

43:21.018 --> 43:22.019
Been looking for you.

43:22.769 --> 43:26.148
Why'd you leave the budget meeting?
Could've used a friendly face.

43:27.274 --> 43:31.904
Sorry, Hari thinks
we should plan to sim a space walk.

43:31.987 --> 43:35.073
Now? We can't even walk on snow.

43:35.866 --> 43:38.702
-I'll talk to him.
-No, just-- I'll figure it out.

43:41.705 --> 43:43.290
Can you pass the wine please?

43:45.375 --> 43:46.627
The wine.

43:54.718 --> 43:55.844
Is there room?

43:56.428 --> 43:58.847
-Oh, yes. Of course.
-Thank you.

44:02.017 --> 44:05.771
Raych, you probably don't remember
the first meal

44:05.854 --> 44:07.773
that you and I had together, do you?

44:09.650 --> 44:11.735
No, I can't say I do.

44:12.903 --> 44:15.489
Well, it wasn't much.

44:16.031 --> 44:17.199
I can say that.

44:18.742 --> 44:20.911
I'd just started at the university,

44:20.994 --> 44:22.579
didn't have much of a food budget.

44:22.663 --> 44:26.458
I'd get stale sourdough
and day-old roast alley-hawk.

44:26.542 --> 44:27.543
-Mmm.
-Mm-hmm.

44:27.626 --> 44:30.337
-Greasy, you know, little bones.
-Mmm.

44:30.420 --> 44:33.090
But warmed up, wrapped in the bread.

44:33.173 --> 44:34.174
Oh.

44:35.676 --> 44:36.718
Was heaven.

44:39.429 --> 44:41.974
He was six, maybe seven.

44:42.057 --> 44:44.393
I caught him in the rare books room,

44:44.977 --> 44:48.313
two Alvarez folios stuffed in his pants.

44:48.397 --> 44:50.566
I never did figure out,

44:50.649 --> 44:53.986
how did you know Alvarez would bring you
the most money on the black market

44:54.069 --> 44:56.405
whilst also being the easiest to shove
in your shorts?

44:59.157 --> 45:02.452
Your mother,
as far as I could decipher, had passed,

45:03.036 --> 45:06.790
and your father was drinking whatever
money you were able to bring back.

45:06.874 --> 45:08.750
That's wrong.

45:08.834 --> 45:10.252
My father wasn't drinking.

45:11.587 --> 45:13.255
He was, son.

45:13.338 --> 45:14.882
My father worked in the heat sinks.

45:15.465 --> 45:17.801
He'd been in an accident.
He had a burn down his back.

45:17.885 --> 45:19.761
I stole the books for medicine,

45:20.429 --> 45:21.847
so he could go back to work.

45:26.101 --> 45:27.352
He didn't drink until later.

45:29.271 --> 45:31.315
After I left to live with you.

45:47.581 --> 45:49.791
Apparently,
I'm better at predicting the future

45:49.875 --> 45:51.710
than I am at remembering the past.

45:59.551 --> 46:00.677
Hey.

46:05.891 --> 46:07.809
I've never seen that setup before.

46:08.393 --> 46:10.437
It only happens once every two years,

46:10.521 --> 46:12.356
so they never use it for the sim.

46:12.439 --> 46:14.483
What's happening with you and Hari?

46:18.737 --> 46:19.780
Nothing.

46:21.031 --> 46:22.115
Nothing?

46:23.450 --> 46:24.493
Nothing.

46:26.036 --> 46:28.163
Maybe I shouldn't have told you
what I did…

46:29.081 --> 46:30.457
about the math.

46:31.542 --> 46:35.379
No, it was a… good reminder.

46:38.257 --> 46:41.301
Hari makes mistakes. He's not perfect.

46:42.010 --> 46:46.515
Yeah, I'm just afraid
I don't know which mistakes are important.

46:48.100 --> 46:51.687
Which puzzle pieces can be missing
and it still be the right picture.

46:53.605 --> 46:55.482
But you still believe in the math.

46:58.527 --> 46:59.653
I do.

47:04.283 --> 47:05.659
This is the Plan.

47:08.912 --> 47:10.664
We're not turning around now.

47:16.420 --> 47:18.213
I still think he's jealous though.

47:20.632 --> 47:23.177
Yeah. Who wouldn't be?

47:26.722 --> 47:30.559
When we get to Terminus,
we'll have more freedom.

47:32.769 --> 47:35.856
Our own little piece of frigid land.

47:36.940 --> 47:38.567
We'll build a home.

47:39.651 --> 47:42.279
Maybe with a couple kids
dozing by the fire?

47:50.996 --> 47:53.749
That's a pretty loaded silence
after mentioning kids.

47:55.125 --> 47:56.293
Still want them?

48:02.549 --> 48:03.550
Gaal…

48:05.636 --> 48:06.803
with you…

48:10.224 --> 48:11.433
I want it all.

48:21.235 --> 48:23.779
Hmm. That was nice while it lasted.

48:24.988 --> 48:26.031
Hold on.

49:26.842 --> 49:28.510
The Star Bridge.

49:29.469 --> 49:33.432
We need to come to a conclusion
about Anacreon and Thespis.

49:33.515 --> 49:34.766
You know how I feel.

49:34.850 --> 49:38.312
I think the Empire
can withstand a bout of grace.

49:39.062 --> 49:40.522
Maybe even benefit.

49:40.606 --> 49:42.107
It's hard to believe you're the same man

49:42.191 --> 49:44.776
whose advice on all things Hari Seldon
was,

49:44.860 --> 49:47.446
"Do not overthink the stick."

49:48.614 --> 49:50.157
I am the same man as that.

49:51.074 --> 49:53.368
As I am the same man as you.

49:53.452 --> 49:54.494
Hmm.

49:58.373 --> 50:00.626
What do you think, Ascending Dawn?

50:04.838 --> 50:08.425
We've been attacked.
How does that make you feel?

50:09.092 --> 50:10.344
Go ahead, young man.

50:11.720 --> 50:13.180
You answer him.

50:16.517 --> 50:19.019
-I'm scared.
-Yes.

50:19.102 --> 50:22.064
That's right.
That's what people are. Scared.

50:23.982 --> 50:27.027
Which is why the best face
we can project outward now…

50:28.820 --> 50:30.572
is one of strength.

51:10.362 --> 51:12.030
The Emperor's peace.

51:13.782 --> 51:16.076
It is the promise of the Imperium.

51:16.827 --> 51:23.333
It was the promise of Cleon I
and each Cleon after him.

51:24.710 --> 51:27.546
It is a race run across centuries,

51:28.130 --> 51:31.884
a baton handed
from generation to generation.

51:33.427 --> 51:35.137
And we will not drop it.

51:36.013 --> 51:43.020
Not today or tomorrow
or any tomorrow after.

51:54.865 --> 51:58.327
Threaten the peace and pay a dear price.

51:59.745 --> 52:02.956
Trantor has been deeply wounded.

52:03.040 --> 52:06.126
None of our citizens remain untouched.

52:07.419 --> 52:11.215
The pain will be felt by all
for generations.

52:11.298 --> 52:15.344
It will scar them forever,
but they will survive.

52:16.178 --> 52:20.682
They will live on. Our world will live on!

52:23.393 --> 52:24.978
You…

52:25.062 --> 52:26.230
will not.

52:27.439 --> 52:30.359
And neither will your worlds.

52:30.442 --> 52:34.947
Not without wounds and scars!

53:16.905 --> 53:18.073
Look.

55:01.468 --> 55:03.303
Go back to your worlds.

55:04.263 --> 55:07.558
Tell the living and the dead
you failed to save them.

55:33.792 --> 55:36.670
Not every choice will be like this one.

55:36.753 --> 55:38.547
But sometimes?

55:39.506 --> 55:40.549
Sometimes.

55:42.176 --> 55:43.510
You won't be alone.

55:44.219 --> 55:46.638
You'll have your brothers and me.

55:47.222 --> 55:49.641
I'll always be here,
as I always have been.

55:51.018 --> 55:53.061
How often does it end like this?

55:53.937 --> 55:55.772
How often do we choose this?

55:58.525 --> 56:00.152
You always do.

56:02.321 --> 56:04.823
The weight of traditions protects us.

56:05.699 --> 56:08.869
There can be comfort in making a journey
others have made before.

56:10.287 --> 56:13.165
Once, I prayed in the words of my parents.

56:13.874 --> 56:18.754
But then my world expanded,
and the words fell short of my reality.

56:21.006 --> 56:22.883
I pray in a different language now.

56:25.969 --> 56:30.390
86,981,803.

56:30.474 --> 56:34.186
86,981,821.

56:35.062 --> 56:39.024
86,981,827.

56:39.900 --> 56:44.613
86,981,848.

56:46.657 --> 56:48.408
No. Not right.

56:49.660 --> 56:54.164
86,981,849.

57:01.296 --> 57:02.464
Something's wrong.

57:18.981 --> 57:20.065
Raych?

57:21.233 --> 57:22.234
Raych?

57:53.098 --> 57:54.600
Raych, what are you--

57:56.310 --> 57:57.394
Gaal, you have to leave.

57:57.477 --> 57:59.646
-What have you done?
-You can't be here.

58:01.773 --> 58:03.525
-Gaal. Gaal.
-Hari.

58:04.109 --> 58:05.944
Hari.

58:06.028 --> 58:07.070
Hari. Hari.

58:07.154 --> 58:10.407
Gaal, you have to leave. Now! Gaal!

58:16.538 --> 58:18.540
Warning. Warning.

58:18.624 --> 58:22.085
Designate Hari Seldon's life functions
have ceased.

58:22.169 --> 58:23.420
Warning. Warning.

58:23.504 --> 58:24.922
Gaal? Raych?

58:25.005 --> 58:27.424
-Come on! Come on!
-What's going on?

58:27.508 --> 58:32.012
Warning. Designate Hari Seldon's
life functions have ceased.

58:32.095 --> 58:33.764
Warning. Warning.

58:35.974 --> 58:38.185
Warning. Warning.

58:38.268 --> 58:41.522
Designate Hari Seldon's life functions
have ceased.

58:42.773 --> 58:44.441
-Oh, my God.
-Get in.

58:45.067 --> 58:46.735
Don't panic. You're gonna be okay.

58:52.741 --> 58:54.326
Don't fight it. Don't fight it.

58:54.409 --> 58:56.954
Keep calm. You can breathe.
You can breathe.

58:57.538 --> 58:59.665
You can breathe the fluid. Keep calm.

59:00.207 --> 59:02.626
Remember to count primes.
Remember to count primes.

59:03.168 --> 59:04.670
Remember to count primes.

59:11.802 --> 59:13.053
I love you.

59:16.181 --> 59:17.182
I'm sorry.

59:48.755 --> 59:53.886
86,981,861.

59:55.262 --> 1:00:00.517
86,981,893.

1:00:02.227 --> 1:00:09.151
86,981,897.

1:00:10.861 --> 1:00:17.826
86,981,927.

1:00:19.703 --> 1:00:21.121
With you, I want it all.

1:00:22.748 --> 1:00:27.669
…981,953.

1:00:29.296 --> 1:00:33.759
Eighty-six million,
nine hundred and eighty-one thousand…
