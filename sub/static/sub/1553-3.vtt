(Sword slicing)

02:30.918 --> 02:32.670
In kung fu, we say...

02:32.753 --> 02:34.463
"One hand lies...

02:34.547 --> 02:35.964
(Both grunting)

02:37.716 --> 02:39.468
(Groans)

02:39.552 --> 02:42.346
...the other hand tells the truth."

02:43.889 --> 02:45.599
(Marco)
Try that again.

02:46.850 --> 02:49.312
If you, one day,
make it back to the West...

02:50.313 --> 02:54.232
what will you tell men
of this strange word, "kung fu"?

02:54.317 --> 02:57.653
Will you tell them that it means to fight?

02:57.736 --> 02:58.779
Or will you say...

02:58.862 --> 03:00.489
like a monk from Shaolin...

03:00.573 --> 03:02.741
(inhales sharply)
to summon the spirit...

03:03.742 --> 03:05.786
of the crane and the tiger?

03:08.414 --> 03:10.165
(Groans)

03:11.625 --> 03:13.210
(Panting)

03:13.293 --> 03:14.337
Kung fu.

03:17.548 --> 03:21.594
It means, "supreme skill from hard work."

03:23.554 --> 03:26.515
(Hundred Eyes)
A great poet has reached kung fu.

03:28.767 --> 03:31.812
The painter, the calligrapher...

03:31.895 --> 03:34.898
they can be said to have kung fu.

03:38.319 --> 03:42.490
Even the cook,
the one who sweeps steps...

03:42.573 --> 03:44.658
or a masterful servant...

03:44.742 --> 03:47.745
can have kung fu.

03:48.829 --> 03:52.124
Practice. Preparation...

03:52.207 --> 03:55.419
endless repetition.

03:55.503 --> 03:59.382
Until your mind is weary,
and your bones ache.

03:59.465 --> 04:02.510
Until you're too tired to sweat...

04:02.593 --> 04:04.887
too wasted to breathe.

04:09.767 --> 04:11.059
(Groans)

04:13.020 --> 04:15.939
That is the way, the only way...

04:16.023 --> 04:18.274
one acquires kung fu.

04:19.652 --> 04:20.653
(Grunting)

04:25.449 --> 04:27.826
Unfortunately, boy...

04:27.910 --> 04:29.286
you have not.

05:08.659 --> 05:11.412
A more fearsome army, I have never seen!

05:11.495 --> 05:13.914
It is no wonder the barbarians fled.

05:13.997 --> 05:15.833
(Soldiers yelling in Mandarin)

05:18.168 --> 05:19.169
(Speaking English)
Yet...

05:20.378 --> 05:22.965
it has come to the attention
of your Chancellor...

05:23.048 --> 05:26.969
that some of his soldiers have questioned
the political order of the Song court...

05:27.052 --> 05:31.515
now that the Emperor
has passed beyond our world.

05:31.599 --> 05:33.976
General.

05:34.059 --> 05:36.687
Who is the most supreme fighter
within your ranks?

05:36.770 --> 05:38.146
Yang Chun.

05:40.190 --> 05:42.275
In Shantung Province, he is known as...

05:42.359 --> 05:43.902
"Whirlwind Tiger."

05:44.903 --> 05:48.281
He has mastered the
Five Animal Styles of Shaolin.

05:48.365 --> 05:51.910
May Song dynasty endure 10,000 years!

05:57.833 --> 06:02.170
What do the men say about your
Cricket Minister's praying mantis games?

06:04.464 --> 06:07.342
With humility and respect...

06:07.425 --> 06:11.013
some have spoken of
the Chancellor's insect games as a...

06:12.723 --> 06:14.349
curious hobby.

06:16.059 --> 06:19.479
Those were the only words whispered,
My Chancellor.

06:23.191 --> 06:24.359
Demonstrate...

06:25.318 --> 06:28.321
why the name Whirlwind Tiger is so famous.

06:29.657 --> 06:32.910
Defeat me,
and you are promoted to a command post

06:32.993 --> 06:35.621
with all its residual income
and pleasures.

06:36.580 --> 06:38.999
However... should I defeat you...

06:39.958 --> 06:41.877
you are my chamber boy.

06:56.016 --> 06:57.017
(Yelling)

07:24.419 --> 07:25.503
- (Bones cracking)
- (Screaming)

07:35.472 --> 07:37.390
Praying Mantis Kung Fu.

07:38.475 --> 07:40.644
Curious little hobby?

07:40.728 --> 07:41.895
(Neck snapping)

08:09.464 --> 08:11.800
Ariq was my brother.

08:11.884 --> 08:14.011
But he was a traitor.

08:14.094 --> 08:15.679
Now, he is dead.

08:17.014 --> 08:20.684
I took his head,
soaked the earth with his blood...

08:23.186 --> 08:27.816
I loved him as a brother,
but I killed him as a traitor.

08:28.984 --> 08:32.863
In my heart and by our laws...

08:32.946 --> 08:36.573
I know this to be necessary and just.

08:36.659 --> 08:40.328
Those who disagree with my actions,
speak now without repercussion.

08:53.842 --> 08:57.638
That is the last
we shall speak of my brother.

08:57.721 --> 09:00.891
Cousin Kaidu will inherit his lands,

09:00.974 --> 09:03.351
his armies, his people.

09:04.895 --> 09:06.021
Now...

09:06.104 --> 09:09.191
as to the war deferred
with the Song rebels...

09:09.274 --> 09:11.902
We were dishonored
at the Battle of Wuchang.

09:12.903 --> 09:15.280
We must visit hell
upon the Cricket Minister.

09:15.363 --> 09:18.116
With respect to my cousin, Jingim...

09:19.117 --> 09:21.954
the Khan must now assert his dominion.

09:24.206 --> 09:25.833
Our forces?

09:25.916 --> 09:29.377
With Karakorum's men
finally standing ready...

09:29.461 --> 09:31.755
- you are two armies strong.
- Three.

09:32.756 --> 09:36.051
The armies of the West
are prepared for battle, Great Khan.

09:36.134 --> 09:38.095
We await your command.

09:46.603 --> 09:48.271
I have much to think on.

09:51.649 --> 09:52.860
(Kaidu)
Great Khan...

09:55.570 --> 09:57.781
Tomorrow evening,
at my encampment, if I may...

09:58.907 --> 10:00.658
I invite you to a feast...

10:00.743 --> 10:02.660
in your honor.

10:02.745 --> 10:04.037
(Chuckling)

10:05.080 --> 10:06.248
I will attend, Kaidu.

10:06.331 --> 10:07.958
Thank you.

10:08.041 --> 10:09.542
(Door opening)

10:18.468 --> 10:21.138
A tribute from the Song Chancellor,
Great Khan.

10:43.786 --> 10:44.828
(Flies buzzing)

10:44.912 --> 10:48.498
How many Song prisoners
did we take at Wuchang?

10:48.581 --> 10:50.834
(Jingim)
A mere dozen, Father.

11:11.354 --> 11:13.190
(Court murmuring)

11:16.234 --> 11:20.906
Rip their bodies asunder, Sire.
Send Sidao their parts.

11:20.989 --> 11:25.327
(Kublai) My Minister of Finance,
identify these brave warriors.

11:25.410 --> 11:28.371
See their families receive
tribute from the treasury.

11:28.455 --> 11:31.166
That is your place.

11:31.249 --> 11:33.460
It will be done, Sire.

11:42.135 --> 11:43.720
(Goats bleating)

12:13.000 --> 12:15.502
(Nima) To service the Khan
is not merely an honor...

12:15.585 --> 12:17.087
it is a blessing.

12:17.170 --> 12:21.383
To be sure, those who satisfy the
Lord Khan's carnal needs here on Earth...

12:21.466 --> 12:24.761
will be granted supreme favor
in the next life.

12:24.844 --> 12:27.890
As well as 20 karats of gold.

12:27.973 --> 12:30.642
You will be tested
by the royal concubines.

12:30.725 --> 12:33.896
The most proficient in the art of arousal
will earn the privilege

12:33.979 --> 12:36.356
of residing permanently here...

12:36.439 --> 12:39.902
in our Great Khan's
Hall of Five Desires.

12:39.985 --> 12:43.989
By "permanently,"
I mean just that.

12:44.072 --> 12:46.866
If selected, you will remain
in the Hall of Five Desires

12:46.950 --> 12:48.868
until released from royal service.

12:49.995 --> 12:52.789
If you are chosen
to become a Royal Concubine...

12:52.872 --> 12:54.958
all needs will be met.

12:55.042 --> 12:57.920
Those not chosen will be delivered
to the Ministry of Finance

12:58.003 --> 13:00.505
to be sold off to the Khan's court.

13:01.673 --> 13:06.094
Those unclaimed by the court will be
sold to whorehouses in outer Cambulac.

13:09.889 --> 13:12.767
Perform as though
your life depends upon it.

13:13.726 --> 13:15.437
It most likely does.

16:40.267 --> 16:42.269
(Boisterous chatter)

17:09.337 --> 17:10.672
Horseman. Sit.

17:10.755 --> 17:12.132
I'm in a hurry.

17:12.214 --> 17:13.383
I said sit.

17:13.465 --> 17:15.926
Business done quickly
is business done badly.

17:16.010 --> 17:19.263
Do you want me to do bad business, hmm?

17:24.560 --> 17:26.188
There.

17:26.271 --> 17:28.522
Eyeball to eyeball.

17:29.524 --> 17:33.027
Now, we can either deal...

17:34.612 --> 17:35.613
or fuck.

17:37.949 --> 17:40.117
Your choice.

17:49.336 --> 17:50.795
Your loss.

18:00.137 --> 18:01.223
It's opal and silver.

18:01.306 --> 18:02.307
And?

18:02.390 --> 18:04.226
Last time, you gave me twice that.

18:04.309 --> 18:05.643
I had bad month.

18:10.982 --> 18:12.442
Hold, Europa.

18:13.526 --> 18:15.903
What's your business here?

18:17.113 --> 18:19.949
I'm a customer with coin.
Let me pass.

18:26.248 --> 18:27.249
(Altan)
Hey.

18:27.332 --> 18:30.042
Where is the man
who owns the bay gelding outside?

18:30.126 --> 18:32.379
Go ask the horse, Latin.

18:33.796 --> 18:35.172
(Marco grunting)

19:11.418 --> 19:13.670
The grassland was
sweet and cool tonight, Za Bing.

19:14.671 --> 19:15.922
So much like my old home.

19:16.005 --> 19:17.799
And so much like his.

19:17.882 --> 19:20.468
What treasure
did you leave for him this night?

19:22.053 --> 19:24.096
You know better than to ask.

19:24.180 --> 19:26.391
My ignorance is not deep enough
to protect me.

19:26.474 --> 19:29.018
And I do not trust the scoundrel
to protect you.

19:29.101 --> 19:30.770
Tulga would not hurt me.

19:30.853 --> 19:33.064
As long as the jewels come.

19:34.231 --> 19:36.150
As long as he harbors hope to be with me.

19:36.233 --> 19:39.571
That tether will weaken, Kokachin.
And he will expose you.

19:39.654 --> 19:40.822
This must stop.

19:46.035 --> 19:47.579
Whom do you serve?

19:50.415 --> 19:53.000
We speak of this no more.

19:53.084 --> 19:54.377
And you have nothing to fear.

19:54.461 --> 19:57.589
That is precisely what I am bid to do.
Fear.

19:57.672 --> 19:59.924
I must protect you.

20:02.051 --> 20:05.305
And as you protect me...
I will protect you,

20:05.388 --> 20:07.557
Za Bing.

20:09.058 --> 20:11.811
You're my only friend in this world.

20:15.523 --> 20:19.151
(Ling Ling singing in Mandarin)

20:31.288 --> 20:32.665
(Speaking English)
Sunflower?

20:34.626 --> 20:36.127
Where is your servant?

20:36.210 --> 20:38.254
Attending to my breakfast.

20:39.756 --> 20:42.258
Excellent. Enjoy.

20:43.551 --> 20:46.554
(Ling Ling continues singing)

21:00.610 --> 21:02.987
(Wine pouring)

21:03.070 --> 21:05.948
(Sighing)
Why would he summon me?

21:06.908 --> 21:08.284
My suspicion?

21:08.368 --> 21:09.411
Yes?

21:09.494 --> 21:12.288
Is that you will discover
the answer to your question...

21:12.372 --> 21:13.665
rather soon.

21:13.748 --> 21:17.168
Perhaps you might lend your
venerable insight to another query.

21:17.251 --> 21:19.712
I would rather enjoy my wine.

21:19.796 --> 21:22.965
The Bayaut tribe. Who are they?

21:23.049 --> 21:27.845
I grasp the spirit of your question.
Tread carefully, Master Polo.

21:27.929 --> 21:31.348
Her parents, siblings, countrymen...

21:31.433 --> 21:34.977
they were slaughtered
for refusing to bend to the Khan's will.

21:35.061 --> 21:37.980
The Blue Princess is the last of her clan.

21:38.064 --> 21:39.982
How did she survive?

21:40.066 --> 21:42.610
Her royal blood is valued.

21:42.694 --> 21:45.947
She is destined to be sold
for political currency.

21:46.030 --> 21:49.241
Steer your eyes from her visage.

21:49.325 --> 21:50.993
She is beyond your reach.

21:51.994 --> 21:53.913
So I've been told.

22:09.386 --> 22:10.763
You called for me, Sire?

22:12.515 --> 22:14.642
(Kublai)
Do you have brothers?

22:15.935 --> 22:17.687
I wish I had.

22:17.770 --> 22:19.188
Someone to play with.

22:20.898 --> 22:23.485
Someone to conspire with.

22:24.819 --> 22:26.028
Brothers...

22:27.572 --> 22:30.157
Sometime blessing, sometime curse.

22:33.327 --> 22:35.538
Like those in your holy book.

22:35.622 --> 22:37.707
Cain and Abel?

22:37.790 --> 22:39.834
Tell me of them.

22:40.877 --> 22:43.004
Sons of Adam.

22:43.087 --> 22:45.047
Cain was the first man to be born.

22:46.048 --> 22:48.175
Abel, the first to die.

22:48.259 --> 22:50.887
By the blade of his brother, yes?

22:51.929 --> 22:53.848
Envious of God's love for Abel,

22:53.931 --> 22:57.309
Cain killed his brother,
concealed his body...

22:57.393 --> 22:59.436
and lied to the Lord above.

23:00.563 --> 23:02.148
What became of the murderer?

23:03.858 --> 23:06.485
He bore the mark of Cain...

23:06.569 --> 23:10.072
and was cursed to roam the Earth.

23:10.156 --> 23:11.490
Endlessly.

23:12.909 --> 23:14.201
To this day?

23:15.327 --> 23:20.207
No. He wandered until
he could wander no more.

23:20.291 --> 23:22.293
So, he took a wife, built a house...

23:22.376 --> 23:26.047
and lived there until it collapsed
and crushed him dead.

23:29.926 --> 23:32.929
Some say this is an invented story,
nothing more.

23:33.012 --> 23:35.389
Meant to impart a greater lesson.

23:35.472 --> 23:37.349
Which is?

23:37.433 --> 23:40.019
The scholars and historians
of Venice are superior

23:40.102 --> 23:42.354
to all others across the land.

23:42.438 --> 23:45.441
I have not the studies
to begin to explore such questions.

23:45.524 --> 23:47.401
Try.

23:51.488 --> 23:54.533
It is in our nature to seek
our brother's possessions.

23:55.868 --> 23:59.038
And be willing to destroy to obtain them.

24:10.549 --> 24:13.260
Superior to all others, hmm?

24:14.721 --> 24:16.097
I did not mean to offend...

24:16.180 --> 24:20.184
You shall attend
my cousin Kaidu's feast tonight.

24:20.267 --> 24:22.895
I await your thoughts on a lesser culture.

24:28.025 --> 24:29.526
Six of them?

24:29.611 --> 24:31.445
(Ahmad)
The youngest was 16.

24:31.528 --> 24:33.072
Maidar's boy. Taban.

24:33.155 --> 24:35.908
Taban.
(Sighs)

24:35.992 --> 24:38.369
How many times had I told Maidar...

24:38.452 --> 24:40.287
he was not prepared for war.

24:40.371 --> 24:43.833
Like you, as a boy,
his head was always in numbers.

24:43.916 --> 24:46.127
- And now it's in a thatched trunk.
- (Woman moaning)

24:46.210 --> 24:48.295
(Scoffs)
Ahmad. Please.

24:48.379 --> 24:50.297
- My apologies, Empress.
- (Sighs)

24:50.381 --> 24:51.674
(Moaning continues)

24:51.758 --> 24:53.718
Send Maidar a purse of silver.

24:54.677 --> 24:56.553
It is done.

24:56.638 --> 24:58.555
The Khan commanded gold.

24:59.932 --> 25:01.517
(Moaning intensifies)

25:10.484 --> 25:11.778
(Ahmad)
Impressive.

25:11.861 --> 25:17.116
I will not choose my husband's concubines
based upon Shria's judgment.

25:17.199 --> 25:20.119
I've seen her faint
when a puppy licked her face.

25:20.202 --> 25:21.245
(Ahmad)
Well...

25:21.328 --> 25:23.080
that's no puppy.

25:24.040 --> 25:26.042
(Chabi)
Have you already taken tally, Ahmad?

25:27.877 --> 25:30.296
Perhaps you'll add that one to your harem

25:30.379 --> 25:32.965
before selling
the castoffs to the brothels?

25:33.049 --> 25:36.093
(Ahmad) Whatever turns profits
for the Khan and fills a treasury...

25:36.177 --> 25:37.469
I will oversee.

25:37.553 --> 25:39.471
As is your duty.

25:39.555 --> 25:40.890
(Ahmad)
Yes.

25:42.099 --> 25:43.642
But not why I come to you.

25:45.186 --> 25:46.896
I know it's not my place, and...

25:48.022 --> 25:49.732
I do not wish to overstep my bounds.

25:49.816 --> 25:51.984
You are as a son to the Khan and to me.

25:52.068 --> 25:53.569
You need not hold your tongue.

25:53.652 --> 25:57.406
Have you any insight
into the Khan's private thoughts?

25:57.489 --> 25:59.200
Concerning?

25:59.283 --> 26:02.078
Spilling the blood of that savage,
Jia Sidao.

26:02.161 --> 26:05.873
Hatred does not cease by hatred.

26:05.957 --> 26:07.499
But it may be stopped by a saber.

26:07.583 --> 26:10.211
Until they eventually
turn the saber back on you.

26:11.212 --> 26:13.089
Are these matters of finance, Ahmad?

26:13.172 --> 26:15.967
Finance fuels the crucible of war...

26:16.050 --> 26:18.344
and its spoils fill our treasury.

26:18.427 --> 26:19.553
They are one and the same.

26:19.636 --> 26:22.598
Why speak of this to me?
Why not Yusuf?

26:22.681 --> 26:26.936
The Khan's ear opens widest
for you, Empress.

26:29.355 --> 26:30.732
(Shria continues moaning)

26:58.425 --> 26:59.593
You are a magician.

26:59.676 --> 27:01.971
You are certain to be selected.

27:02.054 --> 27:05.432
(Nima) Report to the Hall of Purification
for cleansing.

27:11.688 --> 27:12.857
Stop.

27:14.776 --> 27:16.527
Lift up your hair.

27:22.074 --> 27:23.200
Sit.

27:47.266 --> 27:50.144
When did you meet Ling?

27:50.227 --> 27:53.230
I held her on her third day.

27:55.774 --> 27:58.569
How did you come to know my sister?

28:00.988 --> 28:02.656
You whored together.

28:05.492 --> 28:08.495
Mei Lin was my friend.

28:08.579 --> 28:09.872
Chancellor.

28:16.337 --> 28:19.465
Do you enjoy your current station in life?

28:19.548 --> 28:20.632
As concubine?

28:20.716 --> 28:23.719
Yes... Chancellor.

28:23.802 --> 28:25.847
You may speak freely.

28:25.930 --> 28:27.348
I do, Chancellor.

28:27.431 --> 28:32.644
It seems to me
that yours is the work of animals.

28:32.728 --> 28:36.648
I see no worth in it,
as it speaks to our most base instincts.

28:37.691 --> 28:39.735
But I suppose some in life must make do

28:39.819 --> 28:43.364
with the meager skills
birth has bestowed upon them.

28:43.447 --> 28:45.908
I make no judgment, of course.

28:49.495 --> 28:50.787
You are quite stunning.

28:52.789 --> 28:54.250
I never took notice.

28:59.130 --> 29:00.631
Providence is upon you.

29:02.091 --> 29:05.219
Your days will not be spent pinned
beneath stinking flesh on the floor.

29:06.178 --> 29:08.055
You are to report every morning
to my sister's chambers

29:08.139 --> 29:09.348
to care for my niece.

29:09.431 --> 29:12.393
What you do with your nights
is entirely of your choosing.

29:15.604 --> 29:17.314
You are excused.

29:38.085 --> 29:39.503
(Chabi)
No.

29:42.381 --> 29:43.465
How old?

29:43.549 --> 29:45.051
Nineteen.

29:49.846 --> 29:51.891
What of this one's family?

29:51.974 --> 29:54.268
Her father works in
the salt mines beyond the Wall.

29:55.686 --> 29:57.063
And her?

29:59.481 --> 30:01.858
Father died at Wuchang, Empress.

30:03.945 --> 30:05.237
Before that?

30:05.321 --> 30:06.906
He was a potter.

30:23.839 --> 30:24.840
Not you.

30:28.385 --> 30:29.428
You.

30:31.430 --> 30:32.764
No, Empress, please, you must...

30:32.848 --> 30:34.266
"Must"?

30:36.477 --> 30:37.894
That is all for the Khan.

30:39.355 --> 30:42.024
Take them to be dressed.

30:48.447 --> 30:50.449
(Yusuf)
Do you attend the feast?

30:50.532 --> 30:53.785
My head and my heart
do not yearn for airag this evening.

30:56.330 --> 30:58.249
Are you unwell, Sire?

31:02.503 --> 31:05.922
A complicated answer
to a simple question.

31:06.007 --> 31:09.010
Prince Jingim will stand proxy.
(Groans)

31:11.303 --> 31:13.139
What do you make of the boy?

31:15.766 --> 31:16.767
As heir?

31:16.850 --> 31:18.935
No, not that one. The Latin.

31:21.355 --> 31:24.691
He appears... insightful...

31:24.775 --> 31:28.070
Passionate... reckless.

31:30.281 --> 31:33.700
Time will determine
if he will be of use to the Khanate.

31:41.917 --> 31:43.127
Hmm.

31:45.129 --> 31:46.922
Good night.

32:20.372 --> 32:22.416
(Horse neighing)

32:24.418 --> 32:25.627
Greetings.

32:25.711 --> 32:27.671
Welcome, cousin.

32:27.754 --> 32:31.300
We've slaughtered 20 pigs, 30 goats,
and a dozen antelope for the fire...

32:31.383 --> 32:34.970
prepared wine and nermel for days.

32:35.054 --> 32:36.680
When does the Khan's party arrive?

32:36.763 --> 32:38.682
My men are ready to commence.

32:39.850 --> 32:40.892
Pour the drink.

32:42.103 --> 32:45.147
To begin before the Khan arrives
would be a great dishonor.

32:48.984 --> 32:52.779
The Lord Khan
had other matters to attend to?

32:52.863 --> 32:57.618
Hobbled by gout...
he sends his regrets, and me in his stead.

33:01.788 --> 33:06.042
Then let us honor the General
who led our warriors at Wuchang.

33:16.637 --> 33:19.014
May I take your horse, Master Polo?

33:52.756 --> 33:53.924
(Laughing)

34:26.790 --> 34:28.542
(Kublai groaning)

34:32.087 --> 34:35.005
Arrows and sabers, I can withstand.

34:35.090 --> 34:36.967
But the gout...

34:37.050 --> 34:40.179
it's a curse from the Eternal Blue Sky.

34:40.262 --> 34:41.304
(Chabi)
That...

34:41.388 --> 34:44.683
- and an excess of wine.
- Yeah...

34:47.561 --> 34:49.896
So much tension, husband.

34:53.525 --> 34:56.402
Grandfather appeared to me whilst I slept.

34:57.988 --> 35:01.783
Urged me to walk the kingdom with him...

35:01.867 --> 35:04.536
and gout wouldn't let me take a step.

35:06.872 --> 35:09.666
Genghis laughed at me.

35:09.750 --> 35:11.752
He went off on his own.

35:11.835 --> 35:15.381
The Great Genghis
did not have a brother like Ariq.

35:15.464 --> 35:18.592
A Khan has no qualms or regrets.

35:21.762 --> 35:24.180
Ahmad spoke to me.

35:24.265 --> 35:26.392
He thinks war is the answer.

35:26.475 --> 35:29.311
Why does Ahmad speak to you of war?

35:30.521 --> 35:33.148
He is a trusted minister.
I am his Queen.

35:33.232 --> 35:36.943
He has much doubt
his Khan will make the true decision.

35:37.944 --> 35:40.906
He wanted to use you to sway my mind.

35:40.989 --> 35:43.492
Well, he clearly came to the wrong person.

35:43.575 --> 35:44.826
(Kublai)
Hmm.

35:45.952 --> 35:48.872
I should feed his balls to feral cats.

35:48.955 --> 35:51.917
- (Laughs)
- He takes liberties with his station.

35:52.000 --> 35:55.170
He defends you
and wants only the best for you.

35:55.254 --> 35:56.963
(Sighs deeply)

35:57.047 --> 36:00.467
He worries what may come
in the wake of Ariq's death.

36:01.468 --> 36:04.471
You counseled me to kill my brother.

36:05.514 --> 36:08.016
I did and I did it well.

36:08.099 --> 36:12.187
Now, you must consider
all roads before you.

36:12.271 --> 36:15.941
But the journey must not linger
in the deliberation.

36:16.942 --> 36:21.237
I can only assume you have an opinion
as to which road must be taken.

36:22.448 --> 36:23.990
(Groaning loudly)

36:32.082 --> 36:34.460
Choose wisdom over wrath.

36:35.627 --> 36:39.631
Heal any rifts within yourself,
your armies, your people.

36:41.257 --> 36:44.260
The Walled City will continue to stand...

36:44.345 --> 36:47.598
only to fall at a time of your choosing.

37:19.588 --> 37:22.090
(Khutulun)
I have heard much of you.

37:25.427 --> 37:27.763
Marco... Polo.

37:29.890 --> 37:31.475
What does that mean?

37:34.185 --> 37:36.605
"The Great Explorer."

37:36.688 --> 37:38.106
No.

37:38.189 --> 37:40.275
I think it means...

37:40.359 --> 37:41.943
"Pale Flower."

37:42.027 --> 37:43.779
"Flower"?

37:43.862 --> 37:45.364
You look...

37:45.447 --> 37:47.616
delicate to the touch.

37:47.699 --> 37:50.827
I have killed hundreds of men in battle.

37:50.911 --> 37:54.873
I didn't say the Pale Flower
didn't have thorns.

37:54.956 --> 37:56.792
Sharper than a Mongolian's arrow.

37:58.544 --> 38:00.962
Should I be afraid?

38:01.046 --> 38:02.673
Only if you insult me.

38:04.425 --> 38:06.301
Then...

38:06.385 --> 38:08.387
I must watch my words.

38:10.889 --> 38:12.933
And the women you have conquered.

38:14.476 --> 38:16.812
Did they melt in your hands?

38:16.895 --> 38:19.815
Like snow in the desert.

38:25.195 --> 38:27.197
Take me in your hands.

38:42.045 --> 38:43.046
(Laughs)

38:44.548 --> 38:45.799
Not that.

38:47.008 --> 38:48.677
Do you wrestle in Venice?

38:50.261 --> 38:51.638
Of course.

38:51.722 --> 38:53.765
Show me.

38:53.849 --> 38:56.059
- I don't want to hurt you.
- Oh. Mmm?

38:56.142 --> 38:57.227
(Chuckles)

39:01.189 --> 39:02.691
(Khutulun laughs softly)

39:15.328 --> 39:16.538
(Marco grunts)

39:23.712 --> 39:25.171
(Khutulun panting)

39:37.934 --> 39:39.603
(Khutulun panting)

40:12.468 --> 40:14.888
(Hundred Eyes)
If the Gods are always watching...

40:14.971 --> 40:17.558
we might as well put on a good show.

40:20.644 --> 40:24.731
The inability to sleep
is the curse of the aged...

40:24.815 --> 40:26.650
and the guilty.

40:26.733 --> 40:28.860
And the gout- stricken.

40:28.944 --> 40:30.070
Pardon me.

40:30.153 --> 40:31.822
I foolishly assumed

40:31.905 --> 40:34.991
you were dreaming about
your brother's head rolling in the dirt...

40:35.075 --> 40:38.369
his body, a feast for vultures.

40:38.453 --> 40:40.747
(Kublai)
Do they hate me?

40:40.831 --> 40:43.041
(Hundred Eyes) It is better to be
hated for what you are

40:43.124 --> 40:45.877
than to be loved for what you are not.

40:45.961 --> 40:48.421
You're a drunken fool.

40:48.504 --> 40:50.298
So, kill me.

40:50.381 --> 40:52.342
I have thought about it.

40:52.425 --> 40:54.678
But you wish to sleep.

40:55.971 --> 40:59.515
I know you want to tell me
one of those endless stories

40:59.600 --> 41:03.186
from that infernal
Chinese teacher of yours.

41:03.269 --> 41:05.355
No stories tonight, Sire.

41:06.898 --> 41:09.234
No Zen riddles?

41:09.317 --> 41:11.862
I will offer a truth instead.

41:11.945 --> 41:14.239
Had you spared Ariq...

41:14.322 --> 41:17.408
you would have encouraged other traitors.

41:18.827 --> 41:20.871
His execution was just.

41:20.954 --> 41:25.166
No. But it was necessary...

41:25.250 --> 41:29.630
in that moment,
to preserve your Empire.

41:29.713 --> 41:33.008
You ease one worry,
but aggravate one greater.

41:33.091 --> 41:36.344
As life is wont to do.

41:45.145 --> 41:46.437
- (Byamba) Open your mouth!
- (Marco) No, no, no, no, no.

41:46.521 --> 41:47.898
- Open it!
- No, no!

41:47.981 --> 41:49.357
(Chuckles)
Shut it!

41:51.276 --> 41:52.944
(Men laughing)

41:56.281 --> 41:57.532
(Marco coughing)

41:59.660 --> 42:01.161
(Kaidu)
Tell us, Marco.

42:01.244 --> 42:02.578
Do your feasts compare to this?

42:03.872 --> 42:05.248
They are different.

42:05.331 --> 42:07.292
(Byamba)
Here, we eat the pig.

42:07.375 --> 42:09.127
In Venice, they dance with it.

42:09.210 --> 42:13.256
If the Venetian feasts were comparable,
why would our friend leave home?

42:14.340 --> 42:15.801
We wear masks.

42:15.884 --> 42:17.510
For what purpose?

42:17.593 --> 42:18.845
The mask frees us of inhibitions.

42:18.929 --> 42:20.596
(Ahmad) And the butcher
beds the merchant's daughter...

42:20.681 --> 42:22.265
while his wife beds the gardener.

42:22.348 --> 42:24.142
The mask prevents embarrassment.

42:24.225 --> 42:25.226
(Kaidu)
Interesting.

42:25.310 --> 42:29.314
Perhaps, some of our generals
should wear masks in the future.

42:29.397 --> 42:30.816
To prevent embarrassment.

42:31.858 --> 42:34.778
We have the greatest generals in the world
and all of history.

42:34.861 --> 42:36.697
We would have been victorious at Wuchang

42:36.780 --> 42:39.240
had Genghis Khan
or our Lord Kublai commanded.

42:39.324 --> 42:42.786
(Byamba) I prefer a general
with aggression in his blood

42:42.869 --> 42:45.664
to one who quakes with trepidation
on his steed.

42:45.747 --> 42:47.332
I prefer a pure general.

42:47.415 --> 42:49.668
A Mongol, raised Mongol...

42:49.751 --> 42:53.171
bathed in the blood spilt by Genghis,
steeped in his ways.

42:53.254 --> 42:56.341
A warrior like you, Byamba.
Untainted.

42:56.424 --> 42:59.302
A true Mongol. A man.

42:59.385 --> 43:01.137
(Crowd exclaiming)

43:03.223 --> 43:04.265
Or woman.

43:06.351 --> 43:10.563
(Crowd chanting)

43:14.693 --> 43:16.737
Has the Khan heeded our counsel?

43:16.820 --> 43:18.529
Our Khan has a will of his own.

43:18.613 --> 43:21.074
It is a will that may break
if he fails to act.

43:21.157 --> 43:24.703
We will support and reinforce his will,
whatever it might be.

43:24.786 --> 43:25.954
(Kaidu)
Of course, Minister.

43:26.037 --> 43:27.873
I would never suggest otherwise.

43:29.415 --> 43:31.001
He is my Khan.

43:31.084 --> 43:32.460
(Soldiers yelling)

43:40.343 --> 43:41.720
(Crowd exclaiming)

43:43.013 --> 43:45.556
Khutulun has grown more fierce with age.

43:45.640 --> 43:46.975
And more beautiful.

43:53.481 --> 43:57.152
It appears my daughter
will never take a husband!

43:58.153 --> 44:00.530
- Daughter?
- She is a prized warrior...

44:00.613 --> 44:03.658
whose virginity is promised
to any man who can defeat her.

44:03.742 --> 44:06.244
Suitors abound,
offering horses by the score

44:06.327 --> 44:08.038
for an opportunity to wrestle and win her.

44:08.121 --> 44:10.874
My herds have multiplied, but...

44:10.957 --> 44:13.418
I will find Khutulun her match.

44:14.419 --> 44:16.254
You should challenge her, Byamba.

44:16.337 --> 44:18.214
You are a powerful warrior.

44:18.298 --> 44:21.092
I am not worthy, Kaidu.

44:21.176 --> 44:24.262
Imagine if Khutulun
had commanded our armies at Wuchang.

44:24.345 --> 44:27.265
A glorious victory
she would have given our Lord.

44:33.021 --> 44:35.690
We are one wrestler short, Prince.

44:37.650 --> 44:39.360
Care to test your skills?

44:40.653 --> 44:42.280
Show us the...

44:42.363 --> 44:44.991
aggression in your blood?

44:45.951 --> 44:46.993
(Marco)
I would be honored...

44:47.077 --> 44:48.912
Lord Kaidu.

44:51.414 --> 44:52.457
(Laughs)

44:52.540 --> 44:54.417
(Crowd cheering)

44:58.129 --> 44:59.505
(Crowd chanting)

45:23.864 --> 45:25.365
(Both grunting)

45:29.953 --> 45:31.329
(Man groaning)

45:39.837 --> 45:42.132
(Crowd exclaiming)

45:51.975 --> 45:56.479
(Grunting)

45:57.647 --> 46:02.193
(Crowd exclaiming)

46:07.657 --> 46:10.326
(Crowd chanting)

46:28.678 --> 46:29.762
Son.

46:29.845 --> 46:31.097
Am I?

46:33.141 --> 46:35.893
I doubt the Great Khan
would humiliate his one true heir.

46:37.895 --> 46:40.106
No, the Khan wouldn't
shame his one true son

46:40.190 --> 46:43.443
by leaving him to attend a feast
with a Latin and a bastard whose...

46:44.819 --> 46:45.987
(Jingim)
Go on!

46:48.823 --> 46:50.408
Kill me.

47:17.435 --> 47:18.603
(Sighs)

47:27.278 --> 47:30.531
When my uncle, ÃgÃ♪dei,
became gravely ill...

47:32.367 --> 47:35.411
the healers and shamans...

47:35.495 --> 47:39.207
thought they could appease the spirits...

47:39.290 --> 47:44.212
by sacrificing goats, boars and stags.

47:46.339 --> 47:51.052
But ÃgÃ♪dei's illness just grew worse.

47:52.303 --> 47:55.598
So, they tried offering women...

47:55.681 --> 47:58.851
beggars and peasants.

47:58.934 --> 48:01.521
Nothing.

48:01.604 --> 48:04.565
Then men from the court.

48:04.649 --> 48:07.152
Still, his illness increased.

48:09.695 --> 48:13.408
And soon, when he was at death's door...

48:13.491 --> 48:16.952
his most trusted shaman determined that...

48:17.037 --> 48:22.542
the only way to cure him was...
to sacrifice a member of his family.

48:30.466 --> 48:32.302
My father, Tolui...

48:32.385 --> 48:33.886
volunteered.

48:41.644 --> 48:46.357
He drank from the poisoned cup
and when he died...

48:46.441 --> 48:49.277
ÃgÃ♪dei rose from his bed.

48:59.370 --> 49:01.206
That, son, was a tale

49:01.289 --> 49:04.709
conjured to save Tolui's face.

49:06.627 --> 49:08.463
Losing face.

49:09.797 --> 49:12.217
Chinese concept you've been taught...

49:13.843 --> 49:15.553
and have experienced.

49:21.016 --> 49:24.604
Truth is... Father was a weak man.

49:24.687 --> 49:29.775
Screwing whores
and drinking airag till his liver burst.

49:30.943 --> 49:34.697
He never deserved to
occupy the Mongol throne.

49:34.780 --> 49:36.532
Honor...

49:36.616 --> 49:38.784
he had none.

49:38.868 --> 49:40.661
Courage...

49:40.745 --> 49:42.913
he spent it at the gaming houses.

49:44.874 --> 49:47.293
I still hear his whining in my ear.

49:50.004 --> 49:51.797
You, too, whine like a woman.

49:53.341 --> 49:54.967
A man who would be Khan

49:55.050 --> 50:00.181
must stand tall and crush those
who dare mock him.

50:00.265 --> 50:01.932
(Jingim)
You don't see?

50:02.016 --> 50:04.727
If I whine like a woman...

50:04.810 --> 50:07.104
it is because you molded me that way.

50:09.440 --> 50:13.528
They mock me because I think Chinese...

50:13.611 --> 50:15.530
because I act Chinese!

50:15.613 --> 50:17.573
Because you made me Chinese...

50:18.991 --> 50:21.577
You were taught by Chinese scholars.

50:21.661 --> 50:24.205
That does not make you less Mongol.

50:24.289 --> 50:26.332
You act it...

50:26.416 --> 50:28.042
or I will kill you.

50:29.043 --> 50:30.253
(Gasps)

50:40.846 --> 50:43.349
I hear he has hundreds of consorts.

50:43.433 --> 50:46.227
I hope he has thousands.

50:46.311 --> 50:49.814
Being mounted once a year
is more than enough for me.

50:49.897 --> 50:53.734
(Softly) Daiyu says his cock
is like that of a horse.

50:53.818 --> 50:56.404
(Changyang)
Then feed it oats and leave me alone.

50:56.487 --> 50:57.655
(Chuckles)

51:27.560 --> 51:28.936
(Gasps)

51:35.235 --> 51:36.569
(Kublai)
A ladle?

51:36.652 --> 51:40.197
Your cousin said it was made by
the greatest artisan in India.

51:40.281 --> 51:43.409
From the ball sack of an elephant.

51:44.410 --> 51:46.746
Perhaps it is meant to be ornamental.

51:47.997 --> 51:49.749
And?

51:49.832 --> 51:52.918
What were your thoughts
on true Mongol culture?

51:54.254 --> 51:56.297
How was the airag?

51:57.214 --> 51:58.591
It was enjoyable.

51:59.592 --> 52:02.052
Is that the only word you can conjure?

52:04.847 --> 52:07.308
Highly enjoyable.

52:07.392 --> 52:08.643
Hmm.

52:11.896 --> 52:12.980
(Grunts)

52:22.323 --> 52:24.199
How did they speak of me?

52:25.993 --> 52:27.495
With respect.

52:28.496 --> 52:31.374
Befitting one of your magnitude.

52:31.457 --> 52:32.458
Hmm.

52:34.377 --> 52:35.503
And my son?

52:35.586 --> 52:39.340
Did they afford him similar esteem?

52:39.424 --> 52:42.843
He was shown the honor
due the son of the Great Khan.

52:51.226 --> 52:54.271
Describe for me what you saw, Latin...

52:54.355 --> 52:56.148
as you saw it.

53:04.449 --> 53:06.241
A lie...

53:07.618 --> 53:09.495
can cost innocent lives.

53:11.872 --> 53:15.335
A lie about how the House of ÃgÃ♪dei...

53:15.418 --> 53:18.588
treats the son of Kublai...

53:18.671 --> 53:21.424
endangers this entire Empire!

53:26.554 --> 53:29.432
Such lies should be punished.

53:34.174 --> 53:36.271
(Marco)
No. Sire, no!

53:39.108 --> 53:40.317
(Grunting)

53:53.998 --> 53:55.500
(Panting)

54:03.508 --> 54:04.925
Well, if I let him walk away,

54:05.009 --> 54:08.262
he will have his wine
six nights from now and say...

54:08.345 --> 54:12.517
"Khan was lied to by a lowly foreigner
and gave that liar his leave."

54:15.520 --> 54:17.104
He shares your sin now.

54:19.524 --> 54:20.650
He is your scapegoat.

54:42.463 --> 54:45.633
Go, Latin. Sleep off the drink.

55:09.824 --> 55:11.408
(Panting)

55:25.047 --> 55:29.552
(Kissing and panting)

57:23.749 --> 57:24.750
(Hissing)
