Thanks, Eddie.

of decaf to wake you up
in the morning.

Yeah.

No! Becoming a mother.

ask me to breakfast just
to talk about decaf.

Nothing. Can’t I just
enjoy your company?

01:30.383 --> 01:32.999

Overcompensate.

That’s all.

02:55.217 --> 02:57.799
Why is he here?
Dr. Hodgins needs
to sample the soil...

to help determine time of death
while I inspect the remains.

03:01.432 --> 03:03.639
In a shallow grave,
it would normally take...

three days to three years
to reach this stage of decay.

A local cop said the planters
are new, and the playground’s
only been here for about a week.

03:10.900 --> 03:16.645

and general robusticity suggests
the victim is male.

Does it belong to
the killer or the victim?
I don’t know.

The personal info is encrypted,
so I’m workin’ on that now.

- Well, this particular
fracture wound was open,

I’m off to talk to Cam

- You want more of them or less of them?
- As many as I can get.

Well, Cam responds best
to just calm logic.

Yeah, you’ll do fine.

Hi, Dr. Saroyan! Are you examining
the victim’s stomach contents?

10:16.950 --> 10:19.487
Small intestine, or what’s left of it.

10:19.578 --> 10:21.614
Great!

10:21.705 --> 10:26.620
So, Dr. Brennan told me that
you needed someone to put in
some extra hours around the lab.

10:26.710 --> 10:28.371
I’m available.

10:28.462 --> 10:31.704
I think I’m just gonna
divide the hours equally
among all the interns.

10:32.758 --> 10:34.419
Oh.

10:34.510 --> 10:36.501
I’ll post the schedule by the door.

10:36.595 --> 10:41.089
But, Dr. Saroyan, I’m the only
one who needs those hours,
financially speaking.

10:42.226 --> 10:45.309
However, all of you
are equally qualified,

10:45.395 --> 10:48.011

to take into consideration.

10:48.106 --> 10:50.939
You understand, don’t you?

10:51.026 --> 10:55.235
Of course. But the decision
is ultimately yours, isn’t it?

to make a fair decision, Mr. Bray?

11:09.920 --> 11:13.629
I found something unusual
about the victim’s facial bones.

11:13.715 --> 11:16.878
Remodeling indicates that
he suffered two broken noses,

11:16.969 --> 11:19.301
a fractured
left orbital socket...

11:19.388 --> 11:22.221
and a hairline fracture near
the right mental foramen.

11:22.307 --> 11:24.798
All separate incidents
in the past year.

11:24.893 --> 11:26.633
Then someone
didn’t like him.

11:26.728 --> 11:30.220
Or multiple someones.
Or the same someone
multiple times.

11:30.315 --> 11:33.307
Well, either way, it looks like
the hits just kept on comin’.

Yeah.

11:37.781 --> 11:41.023
- Dixon had his face broken four times?
- Four separate times.

11:41.118 --> 11:44.485
And after the last one,
he filed assault charges
against Nicole Francuzzi.

11:44.580 --> 11:47.196
- As in Francuzzi & Schess?
- Yeah. His old boss.

11:47.291 --> 11:51.580
I really want you to watch this.
Okay, that is our victim.

11:51.712 --> 11:54.044
It’s at some award show.
The woman’s Francuzzi?

11:54.172 --> 11:56.299
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Watch.
[ No Audible Dialogue]

11:57.259 --> 11:59.796
[ Chuckling ]
This is classic.

12:01.972 --> 12:03.963
- Here it comes.
- What?

12:04.975 --> 12:06.556
- [ Bo
_ omOth ] Poom!

12:06.643 --> 12:08.599
[ Hits Key]
Right?

12:08.687 --> 12:13.226
The hit broke Dixon’s nose,
so he quit, filed charges.

12:13.358 --> 12:15.815
And she countered
with her own suit.
[ Paper Rustles ]

12:16.820 --> 12:18.481
“Tortious interference”?

12:18.572 --> 12:21.985
Yeah, accused Dixon
of intentionally damaging
her business.

12:22.075 --> 12:24.452
The civil judge ruled
in Dixon’s favor
last Tuesday.

12:24.536 --> 12:26.401
Day before the murder.
You know what?

12:26.496 --> 12:29.909
I think I should go have a word
with Ms. Francuzzi.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.490
[Typing ]

12:38.091 --> 12:40.503
[ Sighs ]
You don’t think I had
anything to do with this?

12:40.594 --> 12:43.427
Nah. Just because you assaulted
Ross Dixon and you sued him
for a million dollars.

12:43.513 --> 12:44.764
I didn’t assault him.

12:44.890 --> 12:46.596
We were having an argument.
You broke his nose.

12:46.683 --> 12:49.095
He provoked me, Agent Booth.

12:49.186 --> 12:53.179
He ruined the— the firm
that I built with my partner
from the ground up.

12:53.273 --> 12:56.106
So you did what you had to do.
You sure you don’t want
a lawyer here?

12:56.193 --> 12:58.650
Why should I?
I didn’t do anything.

12:58.737 --> 13:02.104
- Where were you last Wednesday?
- I don’t know. Ask my secretary.

13:02.240 --> 13:05.368
So, you don’t know
where you were last Wednesday
or what you were doing?

13:05.452 --> 13:07.864
It was probably
some charity function
or something.

13:07.996 --> 13:12.660
Listen to me.
I wasn’t the only person who had
something against Ross Dixon.

13:12.751 --> 13:14.582
You’re the only one
who hit him in the face.

13:14.670 --> 13:17.912
Our creative director did it too—
just not in front of a camera.

13:18.006 --> 13:20.543
What’s with this guy?
Why is everybody
so angry at him?

13:20.634 --> 13:23.091
One day, out of nowhere,
all of a sudden,

13:23.178 --> 13:25.840
he turned into a real ass.

13:25.973 --> 13:28.430
Just like that?
We worked together
for eight years.

13:28.517 --> 13:30.428
We were a tight team.

13:30.519 --> 13:33.886
But about a year ago,
he decides he’s gonna
speak his mind, nonstop,

13:33.981 --> 13:36.142
to whomever
and whenever he wants.

13:36.233 --> 13:40.522
- Can you give me an example?
- He insulted everyone— coworkers, clients.

13:40.612 --> 13:43.524
He even called the CEO.
of Blaster Burger...

13:43.615 --> 13:45.446
“a horse-faced buffoon.”

13:45.534 --> 13:49.152
We lost six clients in six months.

13:49.246 --> 13:50.986
This guy have a brain tumor
or somethin’?

13:51.081 --> 13:54.164
Worse. He grew a conscience.

13:54.251 --> 13:56.708
There was a Christmas toy
we pushed one year—

13:56.795 --> 13:59.707
a little robot man
who wore a little beanie.

13:59.840 --> 14:03.173
Some kid choked
on the propeller.
Did the kid die?

14:03.260 --> 14:04.921
No. He was fine.

14:05.012 --> 14:07.594
But Ross felt really guilty about it.

14:07.681 --> 14:10.798
He joined some group
to help him be more honest.

14:10.892 --> 14:14.726
- Honest?
- Radically honest.

14:18.984 --> 14:21.691
Radical honesty
is a controversial notion
recently popularized...

14:21.778 --> 14:23.860
by an organization
called The Honesty Policy.

14:23.947 --> 14:25.653
Yeah, well,
I never heard of it.

14:25.741 --> 14:28.608
Well, their theory is that
by speaking the absolute truth,

14:28.702 --> 14:30.818
we free ourselves of pressure
to make a good impression,

14:30.912 --> 14:32.368
and thus become truly free.

14:32.456 --> 14:34.993
So they just say
whatever they want,
and they piss people off.

14:35.083 --> 14:36.493
It can be very aggressive.

14:36.585 --> 14:40.077
Explains why everyone in Dixon’s life
bailed in the last year.

14:40.172 --> 14:44.165
| see no reason
why telling the truth would
be considered aggressive.

14:44.259 --> 14:46.341
It is when you do it
without exception.

14:46.428 --> 14:49.386
I mean, the small fictions
that we call white lies...

14:49.473 --> 14:52.385
play a crucial role
in human interaction.

14:52.517 --> 14:54.803
It’s the glue
that holds us together.
How?

14:54.895 --> 14:57.352
A world without lies
would be far more efficient.

14:57.439 --> 15:00.181
If no one had any feelings,
but people do.

15:00.317 --> 15:03.480
Do you lie to me?
No, Bones, I don’t.

15:03.570 --> 15:06.607
- I would argue you’re
doin’ it right now.
- Oh!

15:06.698 --> 15:09.940
- Fine. I am. It’s not a big deal.
- It is!

15:10.035 --> 15:14.028
Tell me a significant instance
in which you’ve lied to me
in the past.

15:14.122 --> 15:16.408
This is a good discussion.
Maybe you should try it.

15:16.500 --> 15:17.535
I can’t think of anything.

15:17.667 --> 15:19.953
Again, you’re lying.
[Weary Groan]

15:20.045 --> 15:23.378
- We’re here. Maybe you
can benefit from this group.
- You’re pushing it, Sweets.

15:23.507 --> 15:24.997
You really are.
You’re pushin’ it.
What?

15:25.092 --> 15:27.799
[ Brennan ]
Oh, The Honesty Policy...

15:27.886 --> 15:30.423
meets at the same community center
where the body was found?

15:30.514 --> 15:32.505
[ Booth ]
Maybe we can get
something out of them.

15:37.312 --> 15:40.179
[ Booth ]
What are you doing?
[ Sweets ] Whoa! Ghost driver.

15:40.315 --> 15:42.601
How’d you do that?
It’s called
Intelligent Parking Assist.

15:42.692 --> 15:45.434
The car guides itself
into the parking spot.

15:45.529 --> 15:48.737
Wow! Look at that, huh?
Does it solve murders?

15:48.865 --> 15:51.652
Of course not.
Good. I like myjob.

15:55.914 --> 15:59.702
Hey. So, I tested the trace
found on the broken clavicle.

15:59.835 --> 16:02.042
It’s titanium.
Titanium?

16:02.170 --> 16:06.083
Yeah. How could you
bludgeon someone with a weapon
as light as titanium?

16:06.174 --> 16:08.961
Mmm, don’t assume
that it’s a weapon.

16:09.052 --> 16:11.759
l reconstructed the bone
and found some remodeling...

16:11.847 --> 16:15.214
around
a 37-millimeter gap.

16:15.308 --> 16:17.344
Gap? What, like the bone
is missing?

16:17.435 --> 16:20.222
Yeah, the bone
on either side
has signs of osteitis.

16:20.313 --> 16:24.056
It’s likely that
a titanium implant was used
during surgical repair.

16:24.151 --> 16:26.642
And I know
where to find it.

16:26.736 --> 16:30.604
[ Grunts ]
Guy’s implant has to be
in here someplace.

16:30.699 --> 16:32.940
An excuse to use
your magic gloves.

16:33.034 --> 16:35.741
Magnetic gloves. Check that out.
[Laughs]

16:36.913 --> 16:39.746
Hey, so did you hear?
Our victim was in a cult.

16:39.875 --> 16:41.866
It’s not a cult.
Yeah, it’s worse
than a cult.

16:41.960 --> 16:45.123
These people
knowingly advocate
full-blown insanity.

16:45.213 --> 16:47.078
Mmm, they advocate
telling the truth.

16:47.215 --> 16:49.672
I think it sounds
like a good idea.
Mmm, I don’t know.

16:49.759 --> 16:52.216
Personally, I’d like to maintain
a certain degree of couth.

16:52.304 --> 16:54.386
[ Chuckles ]
Couth?

16:54.514 --> 16:56.971
Who says “couth”?
| just did.

16:58.476 --> 17:00.762
Can I be honest?

17:01.897 --> 17:04.138
You’re a pretty strange dude
as it is,

17:04.232 --> 17:08.475
but when you use
words like “couth,”
you seem really strange.

17:08.570 --> 17:10.606
Really?
That make you feel better?

17:12.324 --> 17:15.066
Yes, it did.
Good.
Can I be honest with you?

17:15.202 --> 17:17.238
Yeah. Go for it.
Okay.

17:17.329 --> 17:21.242
When you were going out
with Angela, I once planned
your murder in great detail.

17:23.501 --> 17:26.629

I appreciate your honesty.

17:26.713 --> 17:28.624
This is good.
This is good.

17:28.715 --> 17:32.128
Uh, no, I don’t—
I don’t know about that.
It feels a little creepy.

17:32.219 --> 17:34.710
I wonder if it’ll work
on Dr. Saroyan.

17:34.804 --> 17:37.932
Hey, whoa.
She’s the boss, so, you know,
you’re gonna wanna go easy.

17:38.016 --> 17:40.598
Why? Honesty
is the best policy.

17:40.685 --> 17:43.142
No. No, no. No, it’s not!

17:44.773 --> 17:46.559
[Sighs]

17:46.650 --> 17:49.483
[ People Chattering ]
[ Booth ]
So, this is the place.

17:49.611 --> 17:53.069
You should make an announcement
requesting that the killer
volunteer his guilt.

17:53.156 --> 17:55.863
- That’s not gonna work.
- But they vow to be honest.

17:55.992 --> 17:58.699
I’m sorry.
This is a private meeting.
[ Booth ] Right!

17:58.787 --> 18:02.245
The, uh, Honesty Policy heads.
So, where do | sign up?

18:02.332 --> 18:05.665
Oh, no sign-up needed.
Just check your lies
at the door.

18:09.714 --> 18:12.205
This here’s my partner,
Dr. Temperance Brennan.

18:12.300 --> 18:14.837
Is it possible for a lawyer
to be entirely honest?

18:14.928 --> 18:17.920
Well, a group dedicated
to exploring the truth
is likely...

18:18.014 --> 18:20.721
to attract individuals
who’ve made a habit of
lying on a regular basis.

18:20.809 --> 18:24.051
- [ Door Opens]
- Whoa. Wow.

18:24.145 --> 18:25.009
God.

18:27.816 --> 18:30.307
Agent Booth has a phobia.
He fears clowns.

18:30.402 --> 18:32.484
I don’t fear them.
I just don’t like them.

18:32.570 --> 18:34.481
Nobody likes him.
He’s a creep.

this is an opportunity for you
to express your true feelings.

18:48.837 --> 18:51.954
What? No.
Attention, everyone.

18:52.048 --> 18:54.380

to start things off
this evening...

18:54.467 --> 18:57.209
by telling us
why he hates clowns.

18:57.304 --> 18:59.670
- [ Brennan ] Oh!
- What do ya got against me, suit?

18:59.764 --> 19:02.881
- Nothing.
- No, no. You got a problem,
you come out with it.

19:02.976 --> 19:06.184
Why should we let you
stay here if you’re not
gonna be honest with us?

19:06.271 --> 19:08.136
- He has a point.
- What?

19:08.231 --> 19:11.815
Tell the group
something you’ve never
told anyone before.

19:11.901 --> 19:14.859
- Come on, F.B.l. Try it.
- No.

19:14.946 --> 19:18.234
While I don’t espouse
the rhetoric of this group,
it might help to gain their trust.

We want their cooperation.
Come on.

a problem with Ross Dixon,

I don’t know.

- What’s he talking about?
- [ Man] No, not me.

19:44.559 --> 19:46.140
- I did.
- Ha!

19:46.227 --> 19:48.889
He told me my act sucked.
It pissed me off.

19:48.980 --> 19:52.097
- Were you with him
last Wednesday night?
- As a matter of fact, I was.

19:52.192 --> 19:54.774
Something you’d like to
share with us, Mr. Clown?

19:54.861 --> 19:58.024
Yeah. I got a warrant
for felony assault,

19:58.114 --> 19:59.820
and I’m too cheap
to hire a lawyer.

take a minute, okay?
I’m sorry. I gotta go.

Come on! Guy to guy.
No doctor-patient
confidentiality stuff.

20:38.696 --> 20:40.778

20:40.865 --> 20:43.527
Okay, something was
obviously on her mind,

20:43.660 --> 20:46.618
but she wouldn’t
talk about it.

She wouldn’t pick up
when I called her,

20:48.790 --> 20:50.371
and, you know,
she’s been polite.

20:50.500 --> 20:52.707
Polite?
Yeah. It’s awful.

withholding something.

what’s on her mind.

What a baby.

Okay. I don’t understand
why people pay you
to entertain children.

21:23.199 --> 21:24.780
I’m cheaper
than the other clowns.

21:24.909 --> 21:27.286
But you’re right.
I’m horrible.
Because you tell the truth?

Hey, an ugly kid
is an ugly kid,

- Did you kill Ross Dixon?
- No, I did not.

21:33.918 --> 21:36.170
Why were you with him
the night of the murder?

to watch the game
over at my place.

It was... lame.

21:42.552 --> 21:45.134
- Yeah. And when
did the game end?
- 5:00-ish.

21:45.221 --> 21:47.052
Everybody left,
Ross included.

21:47.140 --> 21:49.256
- Were there any arguments?
- No. It was all friendly.

What did you do after the game?

21:52.061 --> 21:53.722
I had sex with a hooker.

21:58.485 --> 22:02.319
Okay. Well, I’m gonna need
the prostitute’s contact information...

22:02.405 --> 22:04.646

for the time of the murder.

You confirm my alibi.

22:09.579 --> 22:13.367
Did Ross tell you where he was going
when he left that night?

22:13.500 --> 22:16.412
Yeah. Out to dinner somewhere.
Did he say with whom?

22:18.922 --> 22:22.085
You didn’t ask.
That’s right. I didn’t care.

22:22.175 --> 22:25.633
| only care about myself.
[ Farts ] Mmm!

22:25.720 --> 22:27.426
Really?

22:27.514 --> 22:29.926
What? It’s an honest
bodily function.

22:30.058 --> 22:33.425
It’s honestly wrong.
[ Cackling ]

22:33.520 --> 22:35.636
Is it important to the case
that I ate broccoli?

22:35.730 --> 22:37.766
Just leave the door open.

22:42.570 --> 22:46.154
Look, these so-called honest people
are no better than liars.

22:46.241 --> 22:49.358
Why? You would think they’d
be exceptionally cooperative
during interrogation.

22:49.452 --> 22:51.909
They are, but nobody
tells blabbermouths anything.

22:51.996 --> 22:55.284
So their own honesty
prompts others to avoid
telling them the truth.

22:55.375 --> 22:57.081
Dixon went out to dinner
the night he was killed.

22:57.168 --> 22:58.669
He didn’t tell anybody
where he was going.

22:58.753 --> 23:02.337
If it helps, Cam is analyzing
the contents of the duodenum.

23:02.423 --> 23:05.335
No, no, no. No, let’s talk
about something else, all right?
We’re eating.

23:05.426 --> 23:09.294
I’m avoiding what I would
really like to talk about.

23:10.557 --> 23:13.094
Why would you do that?
It’s a difficult subject.

23:13.184 --> 23:16.722
It’s become one of those...
pachyderms in the room.

23:16.813 --> 23:19.054
What exactly is the pachyderm?

23:19.148 --> 23:23.517
I would like you
to reveal an instance
in which you have lied.

23:23.611 --> 23:25.147
Oh, sheesh! Not this again.

23:25.238 --> 23:27.570
You think you’re protecting me,
but by avoiding the truth,

23:27.657 --> 23:29.989
you inevitably
cause greater harm.

23:30.076 --> 23:32.738
No. No. l-l wouldn’t do that.
I wouldn’t do that to you.

23:32.829 --> 23:34.410
Lying to spare my feelings?

23:34.497 --> 23:38.615
Maybe it’s to spare my own feelings.

23:38.710 --> 23:41.873
I’ll tell you what.
I’ll give you an example when
we’re finished solving this case.

23:42.005 --> 23:44.041
Okay?
I won’t forget.

23:44.132 --> 23:45.713
I know. You won’t forget.

23:55.351 --> 23:58.093
I do not like that painting.

23:58.187 --> 24:00.098
Wh— What?

24:00.189 --> 24:05.354
I am attempting to open
an honest dialogue between us.

24:05.445 --> 24:07.356
By insulting
my painting?

24:07.447 --> 24:10.530
By stating what I think,
regardless of the consequences.

24:12.076 --> 24:14.453
Now you try it.

24:14.537 --> 24:16.869
Something is obviously
on your mind.

24:18.625 --> 24:22.368
Hodgins, we don’t—
l’m a big boy. I can take it.

24:22.462 --> 24:24.498
Yeah. I’m not—
l’m not so sure about that.

24:24.589 --> 24:27.706
Wow! That’s— That’s nice.

24:27.800 --> 24:32.715
A big vote of confidence there
for the man you’re gonna spend
the rest of your life with.

24:35.058 --> 24:36.719
Okay.

24:38.853 --> 24:41.845
You’ve been a little bit
underfoot lately.

24:41.939 --> 24:44.146
You can’t even see your feet.

24:44.233 --> 24:46.485
Yeah, but l-l know
you’re there.

24:46.569 --> 24:48.525
You’re overcompensating.

24:48.613 --> 24:50.945
You’re—
You’re too cheerful.

24:51.032 --> 24:54.149
I’m not supposed
to be cheerful?

24:54.243 --> 24:56.029
We’re going to be
having a baby.

24:56.120 --> 24:58.611
Yeah, I know that.
I know that.

24:58.706 --> 25:01.493
ljust— I think
we could be more honest...

25:01.584 --> 25:03.495
about what we could face
with the baby.

25:03.628 --> 25:06.586
[ Sighs ]
Angela.
No. This is real.

25:06.673 --> 25:08.584
Just say it.

25:08.675 --> 25:12.042
No matter how many smiles
we plaster on our faces,
it’s still real.

25:12.136 --> 25:14.218
So just say it.

25:16.599 --> 25:19.341
Leber congenital amaurosis.

25:19.477 --> 25:22.969
The baby could have
Leber congenital amaurosis.
We talked about this.

25:24.148 --> 25:26.560
Even if the baby is blind,
we can get through it.

25:26.651 --> 25:29.188
Yeah, but it— it doesn’t mean
that I’m not scared...

25:29.278 --> 25:31.360
or that you’re not scared.

25:31.447 --> 25:33.699
You just want us to smile
and go through this...

25:33.783 --> 25:35.899
as though nothing’s wrong,
and I can’t do that.

25:36.035 --> 25:39.027
I’m sorry. ljust can’t.
Okay, okay, okay, okay,
okay,okay,okay.

25:39.122 --> 25:41.033
l’m— I’m sorry.

25:43.209 --> 25:45.416
l was just trying to help.

25:45.503 --> 25:47.835
Yeah, I know. I know.

25:49.966 --> 25:52.673
Sometimes I can’t breathe
I get so worried.

25:54.011 --> 25:56.844
Well, that’s why you have me,

25:58.015 --> 25:59.801
and that’s why I have you.

26:01.477 --> 26:06.312
This kid is so lucky
to have you for a mother.

26:08.526 --> 26:11.063
You’re no slouch yourself.

26:11.154 --> 26:13.861
And you can be kind of
a jerk sometimes,

26:13.948 --> 26:17.190
but that’s what
I love about you too.

26:23.124 --> 26:24.785
Excuse me!
Dr. Saroyan.

26:24.876 --> 26:27.333
Dr. Hodgins wasn’t able
to find the victim’s
titanium implant,

26:27.420 --> 26:29.786
but he did find a few shards
of what may be bone.

26:29.922 --> 26:32.584
I’ll take a closer look.
Was the victim
missing any bone?

26:32.675 --> 26:35.758
As far as we know,
only a portion of the clavicle.

26:35.845 --> 26:38.678
Hey, did you hear
about the whole
radical honesty thing?

26:38.806 --> 26:40.717
I did.
What do you think?

26:40.808 --> 26:43.015
I am sure it has
its time and its place.

26:43.102 --> 26:45.058
Great.
I should get the job.

26:45.188 --> 26:49.147
Excuse me?
Thejob.lneedit
It should be mine.

26:49.275 --> 26:51.482
Based on?
Financial need.

26:51.569 --> 26:53.560
Daisy and Fisher,
they don’t need the money.

26:53.654 --> 26:57.067
I mean, neither does Vincent.
Arastoo’s family is loaded.

26:57.200 --> 26:59.566
lneedit
That’s a factor, however—

26:59.660 --> 27:01.275
My ability—
it can’t be an issue.

27:01.370 --> 27:03.782
l-l’m smart and helpful
and thorough.

27:03.873 --> 27:06.205
Uh, I’m very
pleasant company.

27:06.292 --> 27:08.829
I’ve been instrumental
in solving numerous cases.

27:08.961 --> 27:10.917
True, but—
No. No “buts.”

27:11.005 --> 27:15.749
When you look at
the situation objectively,
I should get the job.

27:16.969 --> 27:18.800
You are not perfect, Mr. Bray.

27:18.930 --> 27:21.171
Nor are you.
Don’t push it.

27:22.183 --> 27:23.844
[Clears Throat]

27:23.935 --> 27:25.641
Of course.

27:25.728 --> 27:27.889
I appreciate your honesty.

27:31.150 --> 27:33.266
All right. You have the job.

27:34.904 --> 27:37.441
l have to do this
because it’s how I feel.

27:37.532 --> 27:39.989
But you will lose the job
if you don’t let me go.

27:40.076 --> 27:42.863
Of course, of course!
Again, I really, really
appreciate your honesty.

27:43.913 --> 27:45.699
I got the job!
Go, Mr. Bray.

27:45.832 --> 27:49.165
Hee-hoo!
So, uh, I got the results
of the stomach contents.

27:49.252 --> 27:53.871
What do goat cheese,
tomatoes, truffles
and cornmeal mean to you?

27:55.591 --> 27:56.922
Pizza?

27:57.051 --> 27:59.588
Pizza.
The victim’s last meal
was truffle pizza?

27:59.679 --> 28:02.421
Guess so. I had to check out all
the fancy pizza places in DC.

28:02.515 --> 28:04.881
Oh, no. Please tell me
it wasn’t Ferrini’s.
I love that place.

28:04.976 --> 28:07.433
It was Ferrini’s.
They’re the only ones that
serve truffles on their pizza.

28:07.562 --> 28:10.929
Yeah.
Get this. The manager
recognized Dixon by name.

28:11.065 --> 28:13.181
He was a regular?
Restaurant had
to comp his meal...

28:13.276 --> 28:15.892
because he got into a fight
with a waiter by the name
of Jonah Hinkle.

28:15.987 --> 28:17.773
Did Hinkle punch him
in the nose?

28:17.905 --> 28:19.645
No. He poured a beer
over his head.
Oh.

28:19.740 --> 28:21.901
It’s likely Dixon said
the wrong thing then.

28:22.034 --> 28:25.276
If it escalated to violence,
it was probably personal.
Well, there he is.

28:25.371 --> 28:28.158
Hinkle is the victim’s son.

28:34.839 --> 28:36.420
[ Horn Honks]

28:36.507 --> 28:38.748
[ Boot/7 ]
Can you tell me W/7 y you
and your dad weren ’2‘ talk/779?

28:38.843 --> 28:41.505
There’s no records of any phone calls
between the two of you here.

28:41.596 --> 28:44.633
I haven’t called him
in at least six months.

28:44.765 --> 28:47.017
Why?
’Cause he was a douche.

28:47.101 --> 28:48.887
I’ve heard.

28:48.978 --> 28:50.969
Nothing I could do
was ever good enough.

28:51.063 --> 28:53.395
He stopped paying
for my tuition last quarter.

28:53.482 --> 28:55.438
He told me I wouldn’t
get through school anyways.

28:55.526 --> 28:58.233
l was too lazy,
and it was a waste of his money.

28:58.362 --> 29:02.605
This is after he “got honest.”
Yeah.

29:02.700 --> 29:05.692
No one really
wants to know what you
think of them, right?

29:05.786 --> 29:07.742
At least not my family.

29:07.830 --> 29:12.039
My mom got a divorce.
He drove us all away.

29:12.126 --> 29:15.493
So, why was he in
your restaurant the night
that he was killed?

29:15.588 --> 29:18.625
He came in to apologize.
[ Chuckles ]

29:18.716 --> 29:20.422
Out of nowhere.

29:20.509 --> 29:23.251
He said he wished
he didn’t hurt me
with the things he said,

29:23.346 --> 29:26.258
but... he still meant it.

29:26.390 --> 29:29.132
Some apology.
Yeah.

29:29.226 --> 29:32.764
Yeah, I got pissed,
but I overreacted.

29:32.855 --> 29:35.471
I didn’t know it was the last time
l was gonna see him.

29:35.566 --> 29:37.852
Was it?

29:37.944 --> 29:40.105
Yeah.

29:40.196 --> 29:42.812
[ Sighs ]
I tried to go home
and see him that night,

29:42.907 --> 29:45.694
but... I didn’t go in.

29:45.785 --> 29:47.696
There was a car
in the driveway. Just—

29:47.787 --> 29:50.073
A car? Did you see
who it belonged to?

29:50.164 --> 29:53.281
There was a lady
wearing a neck brace.

29:53.376 --> 29:56.368
He was talking to her in the doonNay,
and then she went inside.

29:56.462 --> 29:58.373
I think they were arguing.

29:59.757 --> 30:01.918
Hmm.
So, you didn’t know her?

30:02.009 --> 30:03.545
No.

30:04.929 --> 30:06.965
Can you tell me
what the car looked like?

30:07.056 --> 30:10.719
Uh, it was a little red convertible.

30:10.810 --> 30:13.517
It was banged up pretty good, too,
like she was in an accident.

30:13.604 --> 30:15.890
I’d know it if I saw it.

30:17.400 --> 30:19.015
Dr. Brennan, I found
something unusual...

30:19.110 --> 30:22.398
during my microscopic
examination of the bones.

30:22.488 --> 30:24.274
These faint microfractures...

30:24.365 --> 30:27.778
appear in a diagonally
descending pattern,

30:27.868 --> 30:30.280
anterolaterally
on ribs four through eight.

30:30.371 --> 30:34.614
I’ve seen this type
of microfracturing before—
in automobile accidents.

30:34.709 --> 30:37.576
It’s caused by the compression
of a taut seat belt.

30:37.670 --> 30:40.127
So then a pattern
on the left rib cage...

30:40.214 --> 30:43.581
indicates that the victim
was a passenger on the right
side of the vehicle.

30:43.676 --> 30:46.463
Very good, Mr. Bray.

30:46.595 --> 30:50.179
Dr. Saroyan
gave me the job.
Oh! What persuaded her?

30:50.266 --> 30:53.929
I did. I was honest
with her about my—
my need and my ability.

30:54.020 --> 30:55.760
Well, why wouldn’t you
have done that before?

30:55.855 --> 30:57.937
Because she’s my boss,
and I was nervous.

30:58.024 --> 31:01.516
- So you’re a coward by nature?
- What? No.

31:01.610 --> 31:04.147
- But you just said—
- Forget it.

31:04.238 --> 31:06.445
You know, Dr. Brennan,
you may not realize it,

31:06.532 --> 31:08.693
but you can be
extremely abrasive.

31:08.784 --> 31:11.036
Oh, no.
l-l’m well aware of that.

So, I have something else
to tell you,

31:19.336 --> 31:22.169
now that we’re just
getting it all out in the open.

31:22.256 --> 31:23.712

31:23.799 --> 31:26.006
When you leave
your socks on during sex,

to a guy in a nursing home.

[ Device Beeps ]
Is that a good
or a bad thing?

31:31.265 --> 31:32.675
Honey.
Hmm.

31:32.808 --> 31:34.469
[ Clears Throat]
Uh—
[ Mock Throat Clearing ]

31:34.560 --> 31:37.393
These chips aren’t bone.
They’re wood.

31:37.480 --> 31:39.311
l-lmpossible.

31:39.398 --> 31:42.481
Carbonized wood.
Check it out.

31:44.945 --> 31:47.903
I guess that
does look a little
like carbonized wood.

31:47.990 --> 31:50.902
Red oak,
as a matter of fact.

31:50.993 --> 31:53.154
l-l’m sorry.
Who’s the king?

31:53.245 --> 31:54.860
Oh, yeah.
Um, I’m the king.

31:54.955 --> 31:56.570
I’d be happy to crown you.

31:56.665 --> 32:00.032
- Oh, is that honesty,
or are you just being mean?
- It’s tough to tell.

32:00.127 --> 32:03.585
I guess if I’m gonna be honest
with others, I’ve gotta
be honest with myself.

32:03.714 --> 32:05.750
l—l really
should’ve caught that.
It’s okay.

32:05.841 --> 32:07.832
You’re still part
of the royal family.

32:07.927 --> 32:11.340
Guys, what is
this line right here?

32:16.393 --> 32:19.430
It looks like a nerve fiber.

32:19.522 --> 32:21.262
Oh, my God.
This is a bone implant.

32:21.357 --> 32:23.097
Wait. A wooden
bone implant?

32:23.192 --> 32:25.148
Wood and bone
are biocompatible,

32:25.236 --> 32:27.522
though these implants
are still considered
experimental.

32:27.613 --> 32:31.276
I’m surprised you didn’t
know that. So my error is
totally understandable.

32:31.367 --> 32:33.232
An error nonetheless.

32:33.327 --> 32:35.318
“Nonetheless” is strange,
like “couth.”

32:35.412 --> 32:38.779
Okay. Uh, if the implant
was made of wood,

32:38.874 --> 32:41.741
then why would you find
traces of titanium?

32:41.836 --> 32:45.374
I found nothing titanium
in the soil.

32:45.464 --> 32:48.627
Or on the body. The clavicle
was the only open fracture.

32:48.717 --> 32:52.710
Then the victim
must’ve been bludgeoned
by a titanium weapon.

32:52.847 --> 32:56.681
Wendell ruled that out.
For obvious reasons.
Hodgins agreed with me.

32:56.767 --> 33:00.931

you can both be wrong
as well as childish.

Ah— Shh. Nah.

The rear-end damage
is consistent with the
sudden impact required...

33:13.742 --> 33:15.653
to cause microfractures
to the ribs.

33:15.744 --> 33:17.655
Right. The car belongs
to Dorothy Emridge.

33:17.746 --> 33:20.954
Dixon was a passenger
in the accident,
about a month ago.

33:21.041 --> 33:22.702
And did he receive
medical attention?

33:22.793 --> 33:25.785
Nah, he refused it on site,
and so did she.

33:25.880 --> 33:28.337
But she later claimed
that she had serious
neck injuries.

33:28.465 --> 33:33.004
Why didn’t she get help?
According to the reporter,
the incident happened at 2:00 am.

33:33.095 --> 33:35.051
Right? [Whispering ]
She’s a married woman.

33:35.139 --> 33:37.505
I think they were
having an affair.

33:37.641 --> 33:41.179
That’s not very honest.
Shh. Just let me
take care of this.

33:41.312 --> 33:44.395
Mrs. Dorothy Emridge,
correct?
Yes, it is.

33:44.481 --> 33:47.973
Were you in a car accident
with Ross Dixon?

33:49.445 --> 33:52.687
Well, you know,
these questions, they’re
only gonna get harder.

33:52.781 --> 33:55.739
Yes, I was in
an accident with Ross.

33:55.826 --> 33:59.489
See that? Like your group says,
it’s always good to tell the truth.

33:59.580 --> 34:01.616
In her case, maybe not.

34:04.126 --> 34:08.085
So, were you and Ross Dixon
having an affair?
We were having an affair.

34:08.172 --> 34:10.834
I’m impressed.
She’s very forthcoming.

34:10.925 --> 34:14.759
Mr. Dixon’s son saw you
arguing with Mr. Dixon...

34:14.845 --> 34:16.506
the night
that he was killed.

34:16.597 --> 34:18.508
What were you
arguing about?

34:20.809 --> 34:22.891
What was it?
You’re having an affair.

34:22.978 --> 34:24.764
It went bad,
so you killed him?

34:31.403 --> 34:33.780
I’m not saying another word
till I talk to my lawyer.

34:33.864 --> 34:35.820
I wouldn’t either,
if I were you.

34:38.786 --> 34:41.027
What?

34:45.960 --> 34:48.793
Ho. Your attorney
is Burt lverson, Esq.

34:48.921 --> 34:50.536
[ Chuckling ]
Small world.
Yes.

34:50.631 --> 34:53.418
I met Miss Emridge
at an Honesty meeting.
We were talking.

34:53.509 --> 34:56.751
She told me about
her car accident, and I
offered to represent her.

34:56.845 --> 35:00.588
- Doesn’t seem odd to me.
- Describe your neck injury
in as much detail as possible.

35:00.683 --> 35:02.844
No, no, no. Let’s forget
the fender bender.

35:02.935 --> 35:05.017
Let’s just get straight
to the murder.

35:05.104 --> 35:08.562
I assure you that
my client did not
bludgeon Ross Dixon.

35:08.649 --> 35:11.265
Ross was an honest man,
right?

35:11.360 --> 35:13.817
What did he do,
threaten to tell your husband
about the affair?

35:13.946 --> 35:17.313
That is not what happened.
Let me handle this.

35:17.408 --> 35:19.399
Dorothy had no motive
to hide her affair.

35:19.493 --> 35:22.530
She was already in the process
of filing for divorce
when Mr. Dixon was killed.

35:22.621 --> 35:25.579
- And the affair would
mess up the settlement.
- I didn’t hurt Ross.

35:25.666 --> 35:27.281
She couldn’t have.

35:27.376 --> 35:30.209
Miss Emridge suffered
a left laminar fracture of
her sixth cervical vertebra...

35:30.296 --> 35:31.911
as a result of
the automobile accident.

35:32.006 --> 35:33.962
- Oh.
- “Oh” what?

35:34.049 --> 35:36.131
A laminar fracture
of the sixth cervical vertebra...

35:36.218 --> 35:38.755
would certainly impair
her ability to bludgeon.

35:38.846 --> 35:41.212
But I’ll need
to see X-rays to confirm.

35:44.518 --> 35:47.510
l have found that it’s a real relief
to say what’s on your mind.

35:47.646 --> 35:51.355
I can see that.
I never would’ve gotten the job
if! hadn’t been honest.

35:51.442 --> 35:55.185
And even Hodgins
pointing out my mistake
has made me more careful.

35:55.279 --> 35:58.237
I suppose that’s good.

35:58.324 --> 36:01.157
It’s liberating. For instance,
a week ago, I never would’ve
felt comfortable...

36:01.243 --> 36:04.280
telling you how acrid
| find your perfume.
[ Chuckles ]

36:05.873 --> 36:07.659
It’s not perfume.

36:07.750 --> 36:09.832
It’s lotion, and I like it.

36:09.918 --> 36:12.125
[ Beeping ]

36:13.922 --> 36:16.334
Hello, all.
Any more mistakes, Wendell?

36:16.425 --> 36:19.462
l was just telling Dr. Saroyan
how much more careful I am now.

36:19.553 --> 36:23.045
You know, perhaps it’s
the monitor, but you look like
a flying squirrel, Hodgins.

36:23.140 --> 36:25.973
Okay. That’s it.
I don’t care what
you do on your own time.

36:26.060 --> 36:27.971
But from now on,
unless we’re talking
about the evidence,

36:28.062 --> 36:31.429
I do not want to hear
one more honest word
in this lab.

36:31.523 --> 36:34.765
Honesty is clearly
the downfall of civilization.

36:34.860 --> 36:37.693
Civility, propriety and manners
are its redeemers.

36:37.821 --> 36:39.937
Understood?
[ Exhales ]

36:40.074 --> 36:42.065
Loud and clear.
You tell ’em, Cam.

36:42.159 --> 36:44.866
So, you went to ﬁnd
a murder weapon .7

36:44.953 --> 36:46.784
Yes. You are in luck.

36:46.872 --> 36:49.238
At first, I was confused
by titanium,

36:49.333 --> 36:51.369
but then I had an idea.

36:51.460 --> 36:53.951
Check this out.

36:55.297 --> 36:57.959
Titan/um paint.
The monkey bars?

36:58.050 --> 37:01.338
Yep.
See, the y’re steel, Mont,

37:01.428 --> 37:04.261
but they’re coated
in titanium dioxide.

37:04.348 --> 37:07.511
And they were assembled
shortly after Ross Dixon ’5 death.

37:07.601 --> 37:10.013
So they were lying loose
the night of the murder.

37:10.104 --> 37:12.095
If one was missing,
it would look suspicious.

37:12.189 --> 37:14.680
[Wendell ]
So the killer hid the murder
weapon in plain sight.

37:14.775 --> 37:17.141
I mean,
who would think to look
at the monkey bars?

37:17.236 --> 37:19.898
I’ll call Booth.
We’ll need a warrant
to take it all apart.

37:20.030 --> 37:22.692
See you guys
back at the lab.
Bye.

37:24.159 --> 37:26.115
Nice.
[ Chuckles ]

37:30.124 --> 37:32.615
Can you see us hanging out
at a place like this?

37:35.129 --> 37:37.245
Yeah.

37:37.339 --> 37:39.125
All three of us.

37:39.216 --> 37:43.926
You know,
I know what Cam means,
but I’m glad we talked.

37:44.012 --> 37:46.594
Me too.
Yeah?

37:49.852 --> 37:52.764
Oh, hey. Do you think
you can tie my shoe?

37:52.855 --> 37:54.811
Absolutely.

37:58.360 --> 38:01.898
Do the tops of my feet
seem fat to you?

38:01.989 --> 38:07.029
Not at all.
These are the skinniest
foot tops I’ve ever seen.

38:08.579 --> 38:10.695
Hmm.

38:12.541 --> 38:16.625
You wanted to see me?
Dorothy Emridge’s attorney
dropped off her X-ray.

38:16.712 --> 38:18.748
He wants you
to verify her injury.

38:18.881 --> 38:22.214
And there’s also
a new policy in the lab.
Well, what’s that?

38:22.301 --> 38:25.338
You are the only person
who’s allowed
to be radically honest,

38:25.429 --> 38:27.340
and that’s only because
I can’t stop you.

38:27.431 --> 38:30.389
Well, that’s too bad.
I prefer everyone
speak their minds.

38:30.476 --> 38:32.637
I actually don’t care
what you prefer...

38:32.728 --> 38:34.764
because this is my lab,
and I make the rules.

38:34.855 --> 38:37.437
Then perhaps Wendell
won’t be able to tell you
how ashamed he felt...

38:37.524 --> 38:39.435
that he might have
hurt your feelings...

38:39.526 --> 38:41.903
after you were so generous
to give him the extra work.

38:41.987 --> 38:44.103
He was quite emotional.

38:44.198 --> 38:46.154
- Really?
- Yes.

38:46.241 --> 38:49.699
Although, I told him
that I also find your lotion
to be a bit pungent.

38:51.872 --> 38:54.784
This is, indeed,
a left laminar fracture...

38:54.875 --> 38:56.615
of the sixth cervical vertebra.

38:56.710 --> 38:58.075
That’s what we need to know.

38:58.170 --> 39:02.834
- But this— this isn’t
Dorothy Emridge’s neck.
- It isn’t?

39:02.925 --> 39:04.916
The pointed
mental protuberance...

39:05.010 --> 39:07.467
suggests
this woman is Caucasian.

39:07.554 --> 39:09.465
Dorothy Emridge
is African-American.

39:09.598 --> 39:12.465
This X-ray belongs
to another woman?
I’m certain it does.

39:12.559 --> 39:14.550
So the honest lawyer
lied to us.

39:14.645 --> 39:16.886
I’ll tell Booth.

39:20.192 --> 39:21.978
[Sniffs]

39:22.069 --> 39:23.684
I like it.

39:23.779 --> 39:27.522
Did you bring back those X-rays?
I’ll be needing them for court.

39:27.616 --> 39:29.356
Oh, no.
We’ll be keeping them.

39:29.451 --> 39:32.864
Don’t worry.
We’re not gonna be using them
to file a fraudulent lawsuit.

39:32.955 --> 39:35.196
[ Chuckling ]
What are you talking about?

39:35.290 --> 39:37.952
Those X-rays
do not belong
to Dorothy Emridge.

39:38.043 --> 39:41.911
- That’s ridiculous.
- Dorothy wasn’t injured
in that accident.

39:42.005 --> 39:44.587
You promised her
a big settlement
if she played along.

39:46.176 --> 39:49.293
l was just basing my case
on the information l was given.

39:49.388 --> 39:53.051
Ross Dixon found out
from Dorothy what you
were planning to do.

39:53.141 --> 39:54.881
And since, hey,
he was an honest guy,

39:54.977 --> 39:57.263
he was gonna tell the truth
and, uh, expose you.

39:57.354 --> 39:59.470
You would’ve been disbarred.

39:59.565 --> 40:03.399
You see here?
l have a list of injury cases
that you filed with the court.

40:03.485 --> 40:05.726
My guess is,

40:05.821 --> 40:08.483
you knew you were
gonna do some jail time,
so you killed him.

40:10.242 --> 40:13.734
- That’s pure speculation.
- No, we have proof.

40:16.707 --> 40:19.073
You wiped it clean—

40:19.167 --> 40:22.159
- But your fingerprints are
on the inside of the pipe.
- Inside.

40:22.254 --> 40:26.338
- You see, there’s no such thing
as an honest lawyer, Bones.
- As I suspected.

40:44.610 --> 40:48.148
Hey, look, these
honesty people tell more lies
than the average bear.

40:48.238 --> 40:53.153
Well, upon what criteria
are you determining
that the bear is average?

40:53.285 --> 40:56.493
How many lies he tells.
[ Chuckling ]
What?

40:56.580 --> 40:58.320
[Chuckling]

41:02.461 --> 41:06.420
Mr. Bray told me that I’m abrasive.

41:08.592 --> 41:10.674
Do you agree with that?

41:11.762 --> 41:13.548
Oh, you speak
from the heart, Bones.

41:13.639 --> 41:17.348
lt-lt makes you... you.

41:17.434 --> 41:19.641
You’re just saying that
to protect my feelings.

41:19.728 --> 41:22.310
Oh, I know where
this is heading. I really—

41:22.397 --> 41:24.433
Well, now that we’ve
solved the case,

41:24.524 --> 41:26.731
you promised that you
would give me an example.

41:26.818 --> 41:29.605
An example
of when I lied to you.
I got it. All right.

41:30.906 --> 41:33.488
Fine. Okay, do you remember
when I broke up with Hannah?

41:33.575 --> 41:36.191
- Of course. That was very recently.
- Well, I didn’t lie to you.

41:36.286 --> 41:41.121
| just didn’t tell you
how much it meant to me
that you were there for me.

41:44.044 --> 41:45.955
It meant the world to me.

41:47.255 --> 41:50.213
But you didn’t tell me,
so you lied by omission.

41:50.300 --> 41:53.133
Well, you didn’t ask me.
Therefore, I didn’t tell you.

41:54.513 --> 41:57.129
I’m an exceptional partner.
Yes, you are.

41:57.224 --> 42:00.512
Why is it so difficult
to tell me something
I already know?

42:00.602 --> 42:03.309
It’s hard to explain.

42:03.397 --> 42:05.433
Some things
are better left unsaid.

42:09.611 --> 42:11.272
To things
that we don’t say.

42:15.992 --> 42:18.278
Did you hear what happened
to the clown?
No. What happened?

42:18.412 --> 42:20.494
Violating parole.
Did— Did he go to prison?

42:20.622 --> 42:24.865
Five to seven years.
That is one more clown
off the street.

42:25.001 --> 42:27.492
Ain’t that the truth!
Hey!
[Laughs]

43:01.747 --> 43:03.157
What’s that mean?
