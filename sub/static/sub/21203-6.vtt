WEBVTT

00:05.497 --> 00:08.704
Your father has proved
to be an awful traitor.

00:08.705 --> 00:11.704
The girl is innocent.
She should be given a chance

00:11.705 --> 00:12.955
to prove her loyalty.

00:13.331 --> 00:14.954
You must write
to Lady Catelyn.

00:14.955 --> 00:17.829
If you would help your father,
urge your brother

00:17.830 --> 00:19.206
to keep the king's peace.

00:19.538 --> 00:20.954
Tell him to come
to King's Landing,

00:20.955 --> 00:22.747
and swear his fealty to Joffrey.

00:25.122 --> 00:27.580
You're sure this is
the only copy in Winterfell?

00:41.788 --> 00:43.704
Daenerys is not her father.

00:43.705 --> 00:46.621
And she never will be.
With the right counsel.

00:46.622 --> 00:48.414
I am her hand, not her head.

00:48.830 --> 00:50.496
I can't make
her decisions for her.

00:50.497 --> 00:53.039
You need to find a way
to make her listen.

00:55.580 --> 00:58.496
It's called Longclaw.
It was my father's sword.

00:58.497 --> 01:00.662
It was meant for my son, Jorah.

01:00.663 --> 01:02.371
He brought dishonor
to our house,

01:02.372 --> 01:05.871
but he had the grace to leave
the sword before he fled

01:05.872 --> 01:07.331
from Westeros.

01:07.914 --> 01:10.996
Clegane, look into the flames.
What do you see?

01:12.039 --> 01:14.914
There's a mountain.
Looks like an arrowhead.

01:15.456 --> 01:18.747
The dead are marching past.
Thousands of 'em.

01:18.997 --> 01:20.496
Cersei thinks
the army of the dead

01:20.497 --> 01:21.871
is nothing but a story.

01:21.872 --> 01:24.330
What if we prove her wrong,
bring one of these things

01:24.331 --> 01:26.538
down to King's Landing
and show her the truth?

01:29.622 --> 01:31.247
We're all on the same side.

01:32.622 --> 01:33.705
We're all breathin'.

04:07.622 --> 04:09.954
- You all right?
- Mm.

04:09.955 --> 04:12.163
Ever been north
before?

04:12.164 --> 04:13.829
Never seen snow
before.

04:13.830 --> 04:15.704
Beautiful, eh?

04:15.705 --> 04:17.245
I can breathe again.

04:17.247 --> 04:19.413
Down south, the air
smells like pig shit.

04:19.414 --> 04:21.038
You've never been
down south.

04:21.039 --> 04:22.954
- I've been to Winterfell.
- That's the North.

04:24.372 --> 04:26.496
How do you live up here?

04:26.497 --> 04:28.371
How do you keep your balls
from freezing off?

04:28.372 --> 04:30.871
You got to keep moving.
That's the secret.

04:30.872 --> 04:34.913
Walking's good,
fighting's better, fucking's best.

04:34.914 --> 04:38.371
There's not a living woman
within a hundred miles of here.

04:38.372 --> 04:40.747
We have to make do
with what we've got.

04:46.372 --> 04:48.954
This one is maybe
not so smart.

04:48.955 --> 04:50.871
Davos says
he's a strong fighter.

04:50.872 --> 04:54.371
Good. That's more important
than being smart.

04:54.372 --> 04:57.580
Smart people don't come up
here looking for the dead.

04:59.122 --> 05:02.413
So, you met
this Dragon Queen, huh?

05:02.414 --> 05:03.787
And?

05:03.788 --> 05:07.163
She'll only fight beside
us if I bend the knee.

05:07.164 --> 05:09.579
You spent too much time
with the Free Folk.

05:09.580 --> 05:11.289
Now you don't
like kneeling.

05:14.247 --> 05:16.579
Mance Rayder
was a brave man.

05:16.580 --> 05:18.413
A proud man.

05:18.414 --> 05:22.247
The King-beyond-the-Wall
never bent the knee.

05:23.580 --> 05:27.247
How many of his people
died for his pride?

05:39.955 --> 05:42.579
You still mad
at us, boy?

05:42.580 --> 05:44.621
You sold me to a witch.

05:44.622 --> 05:46.038
A priestess.

05:46.039 --> 05:48.954
I'll admit,
it is a subtle distinction.

05:48.955 --> 05:52.121
We're fighting a great war.
Wars cost money.

05:52.122 --> 05:53.996
I wanted to be
one of you.

05:53.997 --> 05:57.038
I wanted to join the
Brotherhood, but you sold me off

05:57.039 --> 05:58.996
like a slave.

05:58.997 --> 06:00.996
Do you know
what she did to me?

06:00.997 --> 06:02.579
She strapped me
down on a bed,

06:02.580 --> 06:05.413
- she stripped me naked...
- Sounds all right so far.

06:05.414 --> 06:08.163
- ...and put leeches on me.
- Was she naked, too?

06:08.164 --> 06:09.621
She needed
your blood.

06:09.622 --> 06:11.288
Yes, thank you.
I know that.

06:11.289 --> 06:14.246
- Could have been worse.
- She wanted to kill me!

06:14.247 --> 06:18.413
- They would have killed me if wasn't for Davos.
- But they didn't, did they?

06:18.414 --> 06:20.163
So, what you
whinging about?

06:20.164 --> 06:21.829
I'm not whinging.

06:21.830 --> 06:24.787
Your lips are moving and you're
complaining about something.

06:24.788 --> 06:26.829
That's whinging.

06:26.830 --> 06:28.621
This one's been
killed six times.

06:28.622 --> 06:30.331
You don't hear him
bitching about it.

06:40.538 --> 06:41.955
Good lad.

06:46.414 --> 06:50.163
The first time I went north
of the Wall was with your father.

06:50.164 --> 06:51.787
He was a good man.

06:51.788 --> 06:54.913
He deserved
a better son.

06:54.914 --> 06:56.954
Were you with him
at the end?

06:56.955 --> 07:00.038
I was a prisoner
of the wildlings.

07:00.039 --> 07:02.038
But we avenged him.

07:02.039 --> 07:03.537
I want you
to know that.

07:03.538 --> 07:06.537
Every mutineer
found justice.

07:06.538 --> 07:09.371
Can't think of a worse
way for him to go.

07:09.372 --> 07:10.871
The Night's Watch
was his life.

07:10.872 --> 07:13.704
He would have died to protect
every one of those men.

07:13.705 --> 07:15.163
And they butchered him.

07:15.164 --> 07:18.371
I hate that
he died that way.

07:18.372 --> 07:21.038
My father was the most
honorable man I ever met.

07:21.039 --> 07:23.829
He was good
all the way through.

07:23.830 --> 07:27.079
And he died on
the executioner's block.

07:27.080 --> 07:31.246
Your father wanted
to execute me, you know?

07:31.247 --> 07:32.787
I heard.

07:32.788 --> 07:35.079
He was in the right,
of course.

07:35.080 --> 07:37.579
Didn't make me
hate him any less.

07:37.580 --> 07:40.580
- I'm glad he didn't catch you.
- Me, too.

07:49.080 --> 07:50.829
Your father
gave me this sword.

07:50.830 --> 07:54.372
Changed the pommel
from a bear to a wolf...

07:58.039 --> 07:59.622
but it's still
Longclaw.

08:06.039 --> 08:07.913
Lord Commander Mormont

08:07.914 --> 08:10.538
thought you'd never
come back to Westeros.

08:12.039 --> 08:14.413
But you are back,

08:14.414 --> 08:18.371
and it's been in your
family for centuries.

08:18.372 --> 08:20.164
It's not right
for me to have it.

08:23.788 --> 08:25.746
He gave it to you.

08:25.747 --> 08:27.955
I'm not his son.

08:33.955 --> 08:36.121
I brought shame
onto my house.

08:37.788 --> 08:39.830
I broke
my father's heart.

08:42.621 --> 08:45.122
I forfeited the right
to claim this sword.

08:47.289 --> 08:48.954
It's yours.

08:48.955 --> 08:51.080
May it serve you well...

08:52.456 --> 08:54.122
and your children
after you.

09:19.997 --> 09:22.829
Father used to watch us
from up here.

09:22.830 --> 09:25.330
He wouldn't say much.

09:25.331 --> 09:26.704
You probably
don't remember.

09:26.705 --> 09:28.705
You were inside
knitting all the time.

09:30.039 --> 09:31.456
I remember.

09:33.580 --> 09:36.538
One time, the boys were shooting
arrows with Ser Rodrik.

09:37.872 --> 09:40.163
I came out here after,

09:40.164 --> 09:42.413
and Bran had
left his bow behind,

09:42.414 --> 09:45.038
just lying
on the ground.

09:45.039 --> 09:47.414
Ser Rodrik would have
cuffed him if he saw.

09:49.914 --> 09:52.996
There was one arrow
in the target.

09:52.997 --> 09:56.662
There was no one around,
just like now.

09:56.663 --> 09:58.538
No one to stop me.

10:00.497 --> 10:02.163
So I started shooting.

10:02.164 --> 10:04.537
And every shot,
I had to go up there

10:04.538 --> 10:07.830
and get my one arrow and walk
back and shoot it again.

10:09.331 --> 10:11.080
I wasn't very good.

10:12.622 --> 10:15.621
Finally,
I hit the bull's-eye.

10:15.622 --> 10:18.038
Could have been
the 20th shot or the 50th.

10:18.039 --> 10:19.496
I don't remember.

10:19.497 --> 10:22.914
But I hit the bull's-eye,
and I heard this.

10:25.331 --> 10:26.829
I looked up,

10:26.830 --> 10:28.579
and he's standing
right here,

10:28.580 --> 10:30.247
smiling down at me.

10:32.747 --> 10:35.829
I knew what I was doing
was against the rules.

10:35.830 --> 10:40.246
But he was smiling,
so I knew it wasn't wrong.

10:40.247 --> 10:41.788
The rules were wrong.

10:43.414 --> 10:46.456
I was doing what I was meant
to be doing, and he knew it.

10:49.331 --> 10:51.080
Now he's dead.

10:52.580 --> 10:54.829
Killed by
the Lannisters

10:54.830 --> 10:56.456
with your help.

11:00.122 --> 11:01.372
What?

11:11.122 --> 11:13.330
That's your
pretty handwriting.

11:13.331 --> 11:15.163
Septa Mordane
used to crack my knuckles

11:15.164 --> 11:16.914
'cause I couldn't write
as well as you.

11:18.997 --> 11:22.954
"Robb, I write to you today
with heavy heart.

11:22.955 --> 11:25.121
Our good King Robert
is dead,

11:25.122 --> 11:26.954
killed from wounds
he took in a boar hunt."

11:26.955 --> 11:28.455
You don't have to read it.
I remember.

11:28.456 --> 11:30.163
"Father has been
charged with treason.

11:30.164 --> 11:33.121
He conspired with Robert's brothers
against my beloved Joffrey

11:33.122 --> 11:34.954
and tried to steal
his throne.

11:34.955 --> 11:36.787
The Lannisters
are treating me well

11:36.788 --> 11:38.787
and providing me
with every comfort.

11:38.788 --> 11:41.121
I beg you,
come to King's Landing,

11:41.122 --> 11:42.996
swear fealty
to King Joffrey,

11:42.997 --> 11:45.205
and prevent any strife
between the great houses

11:45.206 --> 11:46.996
of Lannister
and Stark.

11:46.997 --> 11:49.205
Your faithful sister,
Sansa."

11:49.206 --> 11:51.621
They forced me
to do it.

11:51.622 --> 11:52.787
Did they?

11:52.788 --> 11:55.079
With a knife
at your throat?

11:55.080 --> 11:56.537
Did they put you
on a rack and stretch you

11:56.538 --> 11:58.246
until your bones
started to pop?

11:58.247 --> 12:00.163
You don't know what it was like.
I was a child.

12:00.164 --> 12:03.996
So was I. I would have let them kill
me before I betrayed my family.

12:03.997 --> 12:06.829
They told me it was
the only way to save Father.

12:06.830 --> 12:09.372
And you were stupid enough
to believe them.

12:11.122 --> 12:14.330
I remember you standing on that
platform with Joffrey and Cersei

12:14.331 --> 12:16.038
when they dragged
Father to the block.

12:16.039 --> 12:17.662
I remember the pretty dress
you were wearing.

12:17.663 --> 12:20.039
I remember the fancy way
you did your hair.

12:21.872 --> 12:22.996
You were there?

12:22.997 --> 12:24.288
I was there.

12:24.289 --> 12:27.163
Standing in the crowd
near Baelor's statue.

12:27.164 --> 12:28.954
And what did you do?

12:28.955 --> 12:31.371
Did you come
running to the rescue?

12:31.372 --> 12:34.163
Did you fight off the
Lannisters and save Father?

12:34.164 --> 12:36.787
- I wanted to.
- But you didn't, just like me.

12:36.788 --> 12:39.371
I didn't betray him.
I didn't betray Robb.

12:39.372 --> 12:43.039
I didn't betray our entire
family for my beloved Joffrey.

12:45.372 --> 12:48.371
You should be on your
knees, thanking me.

12:48.372 --> 12:52.246
We're standing in Winterfell
again because of me.

12:52.247 --> 12:54.455
You didn't win it back,
Jon didn't win it back.

12:54.456 --> 12:56.537
He lost the Battle
of the Bastards.

12:56.538 --> 12:58.288
The Knights of the Vale
won the battle,

12:58.289 --> 12:59.913
and they rode north
for me.

12:59.914 --> 13:03.205
While you were off, where?
Traveling the world?

13:03.206 --> 13:06.038
- I was training.
- Training.

13:06.039 --> 13:07.913
Well, while
you were training,

13:07.914 --> 13:11.163
I suffered things
you could never imagine.

13:11.164 --> 13:13.788
Oh, I don't know about that.
I can imagine quite a lot.

13:15.622 --> 13:18.537
You never would have
survived what I survived.

13:18.538 --> 13:21.122
I guess
we'll never know.

13:25.247 --> 13:27.080
What are you going to do
with that letter?

13:28.580 --> 13:30.039
I don't know yet.

13:31.580 --> 13:34.371
Who did you show it to?
Where did you find it?

13:34.372 --> 13:36.455
You're scared,
aren't you?

13:36.456 --> 13:38.579
What are you
scared of?

13:38.580 --> 13:40.579
You didn't commit
any crimes.

13:40.580 --> 13:42.413
- No one's going to hang you.
- Well, Arya...

13:42.414 --> 13:44.871
You're scared I'll show it
to Jon and he'll be angry.

13:44.872 --> 13:48.246
No, that's not Jon.
He'll understand.

13:48.247 --> 13:50.205
You were just
a scared little girl,

13:50.206 --> 13:52.413
all alone with
the wicked Lannisters.

13:52.414 --> 13:56.288
Do you know how happy Cersei would
be right now if she saw us fighting?

13:56.289 --> 13:58.288
This is exactly
what she wants.

13:58.289 --> 14:00.371
This is what she's always wanted...
to tear us apart.

14:00.372 --> 14:02.955
You're scared the Northern
lords will read it.

14:04.456 --> 14:06.163
They wouldn't think much
of Lady Sansa

14:06.164 --> 14:09.163
if they knew how she did
Cersei's bidding.

14:09.164 --> 14:12.163
What would little
Lyanna Mormont say?

14:12.164 --> 14:15.330
She's younger than you were
when you wrote this.

14:15.331 --> 14:17.830
Are you going to say,
"But I was just a child?"

14:20.538 --> 14:22.413
You're angry.

14:22.414 --> 14:25.621
Sometimes anger makes people
do unfortunate things.

14:25.622 --> 14:28.247
Sometimes fear makes them
do unfortunate things.

14:30.247 --> 14:32.122
I'll go with anger.

15:02.955 --> 15:05.038
You're the one
they call "the Dog."

15:05.039 --> 15:06.871
Fuck off.

15:06.872 --> 15:08.662
They told me
you were mean.

15:08.663 --> 15:11.079
Were you born mean
or you just hate wildings?

15:11.080 --> 15:13.455
I don't give two shits
about wildings.

15:13.456 --> 15:15.163
It's gingers I hate.

15:15.164 --> 15:17.038
Gingers are beautiful.

15:17.039 --> 15:20.621
We are kissed by fire,
just like you.

15:20.622 --> 15:23.538
Don't point
your fucking finger at me.

15:27.788 --> 15:30.913
Did you trip into the fire
when you were a baby?

15:30.914 --> 15:32.662
I didn't trip,
I was pushed.

15:32.663 --> 15:34.579
And ever since,
you've been mean.

15:34.580 --> 15:36.205
Will you fuck off?

15:36.206 --> 15:38.163
I don't think
you're truly mean.

15:38.164 --> 15:39.705
You have sad eyes.

15:40.997 --> 15:42.704
You want to suck my dick,
is that it?

15:42.705 --> 15:45.413
- Dick?
- Cock.

15:45.414 --> 15:47.413
Ah, dick.

15:47.414 --> 15:48.704
I like it.

15:48.705 --> 15:50.746
I bet you do.

15:50.747 --> 15:53.371
Nope,
it's pussy for me.

15:53.372 --> 15:56.371
I have a beauty waiting for me
back at Winterfell.

15:56.372 --> 15:58.496
If I ever
get back there.

15:58.497 --> 16:01.246
Yellow hair,
blue eyes,

16:01.247 --> 16:03.455
the tallest woman
you've ever seen.

16:03.456 --> 16:04.914
Almost as tall
as you.

16:07.080 --> 16:09.246
- Brienne of Tarth.
- You know her?

16:09.247 --> 16:11.579
You're with Brienne
of fucking Tarth?

16:11.580 --> 16:13.954
Well, not with her yet.

16:13.955 --> 16:17.579
- But I see the way she looks at me.
- How does she look at you?

16:17.580 --> 16:20.038
Like she wants to carve you
up and eat your liver?

16:20.039 --> 16:21.787
You do know her.

16:21.788 --> 16:23.246
We've met.

16:23.247 --> 16:25.371
I want to make
babies with her.

16:25.372 --> 16:28.371
Think of them...
great big monsters.

16:28.372 --> 16:29.954
They'd conquer
the world.

16:29.955 --> 16:33.537
How did a mad fucker
like you live this long?

16:33.538 --> 16:35.289
I'm good
at killing people.

16:38.206 --> 16:39.829
You don't look
much like him.

16:39.830 --> 16:41.288
Who's that?

16:41.289 --> 16:43.330
Your father.

16:43.331 --> 16:45.413
I suppose you favor
your mother.

16:45.414 --> 16:47.787
You knew him?

16:47.788 --> 16:49.579
'Course I did.

16:49.580 --> 16:51.163
When he was Hand,

16:51.164 --> 16:53.537
he sent me off hunting
for the Mountain.

16:53.538 --> 16:54.996
Your wildling friend
told me

16:54.997 --> 16:57.288
the red woman
brought you back.

16:57.289 --> 17:01.455
Thoros has brought
me back six times.

17:01.456 --> 17:04.537
We both serve
the same lord.

17:04.538 --> 17:06.454
I serve the North.

17:06.455 --> 17:08.496
The North didn't
raise you from the dead.

17:08.497 --> 17:10.496
The Lord of Light
never spoke to me.

17:10.497 --> 17:11.871
I don't know
anything about him.

17:11.872 --> 17:13.496
I don't know
what he wants from me.

17:13.497 --> 17:16.871
- He wants you alive.
- Why?

17:16.872 --> 17:19.288
I don't know.

17:19.289 --> 17:22.662
That's all anyone can tell me...
"I don't know."

17:22.663 --> 17:24.496
So, what's the point
in serving a god

17:24.497 --> 17:26.996
if none of us knows
what he wants?

17:26.997 --> 17:29.704
I think about that
all the time.

17:29.705 --> 17:32.787
I don't think it's our
purpose to understand.

17:32.788 --> 17:36.163
Except one thing...
we're soldiers.

17:36.164 --> 17:38.829
We have to know
what we're fighting for.

17:38.830 --> 17:42.038
I'm not fighting so some
man or woman I barely know

17:42.039 --> 17:45.079
can sit on a throne
made of swords.

17:45.080 --> 17:47.496
So, what are you
fighting for?

17:47.497 --> 17:48.663
Life.

17:50.164 --> 17:51.996
Death is the enemy.

17:51.997 --> 17:55.289
The first enemy
and the last.

17:57.122 --> 17:58.206
But we all die.

18:00.206 --> 18:02.537
The enemy always wins.

18:02.538 --> 18:04.787
And we still need
to fight him.

18:04.788 --> 18:06.746
That's all I know.

18:06.747 --> 18:10.205
You and I won't find much
joy while we're here,

18:10.206 --> 18:12.455
but we can keep
others alive.

18:12.456 --> 18:15.247
We can defend those
who can't defend themselves.

18:18.538 --> 18:21.455
"I am the shield that
guards the realms of men."

18:21.456 --> 18:25.288
Maybe we don't need to
understand any more than that.

18:25.289 --> 18:27.496
Maybe that's enough.

18:27.497 --> 18:28.747
Aye.

18:30.456 --> 18:32.206
Maybe that's enough.

18:39.997 --> 18:42.580
That's what I saw
in the fire.

18:43.747 --> 18:45.788
A mountain
like an arrowhead.

18:47.705 --> 18:49.122
Are you sure?

18:52.164 --> 18:53.580
We're getting close.

19:01.580 --> 19:03.580
Do you know
what I like about you?

19:05.872 --> 19:09.079
- I honestly don't.
- You're not a hero.

19:09.080 --> 19:10.621
Oh.

19:10.622 --> 19:13.413
Well, I've been heroic
on occasion.

19:13.414 --> 19:16.205
I once charged through the Mud
Gate of King's Landing and...

19:16.206 --> 19:17.996
I don't want you
to be a hero.

19:17.997 --> 19:21.288
Heroes do stupid things
and they die.

19:21.289 --> 19:23.330
Drogo, Jorah, Daario,

19:23.331 --> 19:26.621
even this...
Jon Snow...

19:26.622 --> 19:29.288
they all try
to outdo each other.

19:29.289 --> 19:31.455
Who can do the stupidest,
bravest thing.

19:31.456 --> 19:34.455
It's interesting,
these heroes you name.

19:34.456 --> 19:36.662
Drogo, Jorah, Daario,

19:36.663 --> 19:39.579
even this...
Jon Snow.

19:39.580 --> 19:41.704
They all
fell in love with you.

19:41.705 --> 19:44.662
- Jon Snow's not in love with me.
- Oh, my mistake.

19:44.663 --> 19:46.371
I suppose he stares
at you longingly

19:46.372 --> 19:49.289
because he's hopeful for a
successful military alliance.

19:52.788 --> 19:55.246
He's too little for me.

19:55.247 --> 19:57.079
I didn't mean...

19:57.080 --> 20:00.246
As heroes go,
he is quite little.

20:00.247 --> 20:02.662
I know you're brave.

20:02.663 --> 20:04.622
I wouldn't have chosen
a coward as my Hand.

20:09.663 --> 20:12.537
So, if all goes well,

20:12.538 --> 20:14.830
I'll finally get
to meet your sister.

20:16.372 --> 20:18.163
From everything
you've told me about her,

20:18.164 --> 20:20.496
she'd rather murder me
than speak with me.

20:20.497 --> 20:24.330
Oh, first, she'd torture
you in some horrible way,

20:24.331 --> 20:25.456
then she'd murder you.

20:26.872 --> 20:30.371
Nobody trusts my sister
less than I do, believe me.

20:30.372 --> 20:32.163
But if we go
to the capital,

20:32.164 --> 20:34.996
we'll go with two armies,
we'll go with three dragons.

20:34.997 --> 20:38.746
Anyone touches you, King's Landing
burns down to the foundation stones.

20:38.747 --> 20:40.787
And right now, she's thinking
of how to set a trap.

20:40.788 --> 20:42.371
Of course she is.

20:42.372 --> 20:44.662
And she's wondering what
trap you're laying for her.

20:44.663 --> 20:46.121
Are we?

20:46.122 --> 20:48.289
Laying any traps?

20:50.289 --> 20:53.621
If we want to create
a new and better world,

20:53.622 --> 20:56.746
I'm not sure deceit and mass
murder is the best way to start.

20:56.747 --> 20:59.538
Which war was won without
deceit and mass murder?

21:01.206 --> 21:03.330
Yes, you'll need
to be ruthless

21:03.331 --> 21:05.205
if you're going
to win the throne.

21:05.206 --> 21:07.246
You need to inspire
a degree of fear.

21:07.247 --> 21:09.621
But fear
is all Cersei has.

21:09.622 --> 21:12.455
It's all my father had,
and Joffrey.

21:12.456 --> 21:14.371
It makes
their power brittle

21:14.372 --> 21:18.163
because everyone beneath them
longs to see them dead.

21:18.164 --> 21:20.704
Aegon Targaryen got
quite a long way on fear.

21:20.705 --> 21:22.371
He did.

21:22.372 --> 21:24.996
But you once spoke to me
of breaking the wheel.

21:24.997 --> 21:26.455
Aegon built a wheel.

21:26.456 --> 21:28.662
If that's the kind of queen
you want to be,

21:28.663 --> 21:31.246
how are you different from all the
other tyrants that came before you?

21:31.247 --> 21:34.662
So we walk
into the lions' den.

21:34.663 --> 21:36.330
My brother promised me
he'd keep a grip

21:36.331 --> 21:37.954
on the Lannister forces.

21:37.955 --> 21:41.829
Forgive me, but I don't care
about any Lannister promises.

21:41.830 --> 21:43.121
Except yours.

21:43.122 --> 21:45.246
And I promised him

21:45.247 --> 21:47.788
I'd keep you from doing
anything impulsive.

21:49.206 --> 21:50.580
Impulsive?

21:54.122 --> 21:56.829
This will be
a difficult negotiation.

21:56.830 --> 22:00.371
We're sitting down with people who
want to see us both headless.

22:00.372 --> 22:02.871
My sister is likely to say
something provocative.

22:02.872 --> 22:05.413
- And?
- And you have been known

22:05.414 --> 22:07.579
to lose your temper
from time to time,

22:07.580 --> 22:08.913
as all great leaders do.

22:08.914 --> 22:11.330
When have I lost
my temper?

22:11.331 --> 22:13.871
Burning the Tarlys,
for instance.

22:13.872 --> 22:15.413
That was not impulsive.

22:15.414 --> 22:18.246
That was necessary.

22:18.247 --> 22:20.163
- Perhaps.
- Perhaps?

22:20.164 --> 22:23.746
Perhaps the father
needed to die and not the son.

22:23.747 --> 22:26.455
Perhaps they both needed time
to contemplate their mistakes

22:26.456 --> 22:28.746
in the solitude
of a cold cell.

22:28.747 --> 22:31.163
We had no time to discuss
the possibilities

22:31.164 --> 22:33.205
before you ended
their possibilities.

22:33.206 --> 22:34.913
One could be forgiven
for thinking you're taking

22:34.914 --> 22:36.746
your family's side
in this debate.

22:36.747 --> 22:38.579
I am taking
their side.

22:38.580 --> 22:40.288
You need to take
your enemy's side

22:40.289 --> 22:42.288
if you're going to see
things the way they do.

22:42.289 --> 22:44.246
And you need to see things
the way they do

22:44.247 --> 22:46.288
if you're going to
anticipate their actions,

22:46.289 --> 22:49.621
respond effectively,
and beat them.

22:49.622 --> 22:51.954
Which I want you
to do very much.

22:51.955 --> 22:55.455
Because I believe in you and in
the world you want to build.

22:55.456 --> 22:58.121
But the world
you want to build

22:58.122 --> 22:59.704
doesn't get built
all at once.

22:59.705 --> 23:02.829
Probably not
in a single lifetime.

23:02.830 --> 23:05.662
How do we ensure
that your vision endures?

23:05.663 --> 23:08.622
After you break the wheel, how
do we make sure it stays broken?

23:11.164 --> 23:14.496
You want to know who sits on the
Iron Throne after I'm dead.

23:14.497 --> 23:15.538
Is that it?

23:17.331 --> 23:19.246
You say you can't
have children,

23:19.247 --> 23:22.537
but there are other ways
of choosing a successor.

23:22.538 --> 23:24.662
The Night's Watch
has one method.

23:24.663 --> 23:27.038
The ironborn, for all their
many flaws, have another.

23:27.039 --> 23:29.746
We will discuss the succession
after I wear the crown.

23:29.747 --> 23:31.496
Your Grace, I saw
hundreds of arrows

23:31.497 --> 23:33.829
fly towards you when you
fought on the Blackwater Rush,

23:33.830 --> 23:35.913
and I saw hundreds
of arrows miss.

23:35.914 --> 23:38.537
But any one of them could have
found your heart and ended your...

23:38.538 --> 23:41.704
You've been thinking about my
death quite a bit, haven't you?

23:41.705 --> 23:43.288
Is this one of the items
you discussed

23:43.289 --> 23:44.996
with your brother
in King's Landing?

23:44.997 --> 23:47.455
I'm trying to serve you
by planning for the long term.

23:47.456 --> 23:49.038
Perhaps if you planned
for the short term,

23:49.039 --> 23:51.080
we wouldn't have lost
Dorne and Highgarden.

23:54.164 --> 23:58.372
We will discuss the succession
after I wear the crown.

24:37.080 --> 24:38.372
Look!

24:46.997 --> 24:48.289
A bear.

24:49.747 --> 24:51.414
Big fucker.

24:58.914 --> 25:01.247
Do bears have
blue eyes?

27:06.080 --> 27:07.747
We have to get him
back to Eastwatch.

27:10.080 --> 27:11.456
Flask.

27:30.538 --> 27:31.747
Go on.

27:48.372 --> 27:49.621
You all right?

27:49.622 --> 27:53.371
I just got bit
by a dead bear.

27:53.372 --> 27:56.122
Aye, you did.

27:57.997 --> 27:59.914
Funny old life.

28:01.830 --> 28:03.662
Right, then.

28:03.663 --> 28:05.580
We're off.

28:31.497 --> 28:34.704
- Where did she get it?
- I don't know.

28:34.705 --> 28:36.830
She seems
very resourceful.

28:39.414 --> 28:40.913
You're worried.

28:40.914 --> 28:42.579
We're asking
20,000 men

28:42.580 --> 28:46.330
to fight with us in the worst
winter any of them have ever seen.

28:46.331 --> 28:49.330
The weather will be
the least of their problems.

28:49.331 --> 28:52.121
Many of them will be happy to
find a good reason to go home.

28:52.122 --> 28:55.621
- You question their loyalty?
- Their loyalty is to Jon.

28:55.622 --> 28:58.246
Jon is not here. I haven't
heard from him in weeks.

28:58.247 --> 29:00.288
You're the Lady
of Winterfell.

29:00.289 --> 29:02.997
The king chose you
to rule in his absence.

29:04.830 --> 29:06.787
And rule you have.

29:06.788 --> 29:10.121
Wisely, ably.

29:10.122 --> 29:12.871
They see that.
They respect you.

29:12.872 --> 29:14.288
Some may even
prefer you.

29:14.289 --> 29:15.704
Yes, they turned
their backs on Jon

29:15.705 --> 29:17.121
when it was time
to retake Winterfell,

29:17.122 --> 29:18.787
then they named him
their king,

29:18.788 --> 29:20.662
and now they're ready to turn
their backs on him again.

29:20.663 --> 29:22.913
How far would you trust
men like that?

29:22.914 --> 29:24.996
They're all
bloody wind vanes.

29:24.997 --> 29:27.038
If they found out
that I wrote that letter,

29:27.039 --> 29:28.537
a woman who's
already married

29:28.538 --> 29:32.079
not one, but two enemies
of her house...

29:32.080 --> 29:35.121
By the time Jon comes back,
he'll have no army left.

29:35.122 --> 29:36.914
Arya's not like them.

29:39.331 --> 29:40.746
She's your sister.

29:40.747 --> 29:42.537
You may have
disagreements,

29:42.538 --> 29:44.996
but she would never
betray her family.

29:44.997 --> 29:47.537
She would if she thought
I was going to betray Jon.

29:47.538 --> 29:49.455
Is that
what she thinks?

29:49.456 --> 29:51.371
I don't know
what she thinks.

29:51.372 --> 29:53.414
I don't know her
anymore.

29:55.705 --> 29:58.247
Perhaps Lady Brienne
could help.

30:00.705 --> 30:04.704
She's sworn to protect
both of Catelyn Stark's girls,

30:04.705 --> 30:05.955
is she not?

30:07.538 --> 30:08.955
She is.

30:13.414 --> 30:17.288
And if one of you were planning
to harm the other in any way,

30:17.289 --> 30:19.414
wouldn't she be
honor bound to intercede?

30:22.456 --> 30:23.914
She would.

30:36.955 --> 30:40.371
- Something I've always wanted to know.
- All right.

30:40.372 --> 30:44.621
How drunk were you when you charged
through the breach on Pyke?

30:44.622 --> 30:48.414
If I'm being honest, I don't remember
charging through the breach.

30:50.289 --> 30:53.954
Some of the lads told me
about it the next morning.

30:53.955 --> 30:56.330
Sounded like
a good scrap.

30:56.331 --> 30:58.621
Aye.

30:58.622 --> 31:00.913
It was
a proper scrap.

31:00.914 --> 31:04.288
The ironborn thought
you were some kind of god,

31:04.289 --> 31:06.622
the way you were waving
that flaming sword.

31:07.997 --> 31:11.704
I thought you were
the bravest man I ever saw.

31:11.705 --> 31:13.580
Just the drunkest.

31:54.372 --> 31:55.787
Where's
the rest of them?

31:55.788 --> 31:58.039
If we wait long enough,
we'll find out.

34:28.164 --> 34:29.704
Run back to Eastwatch.

34:29.705 --> 34:31.913
Get a raven to Daenerys,
tell her what's happened.

34:31.914 --> 34:35.289
- I'm not leaving you.
- You're the fastest. Go, now.

34:36.830 --> 34:39.205
You're faster without the hammer.
Give it.

34:39.206 --> 34:40.331
Give it!

34:48.414 --> 34:51.038
- Come on!
- Run!

34:51.039 --> 34:52.538
Come on!

34:59.040 --> 35:00.580
Stop!

35:18.331 --> 35:19.331
Go!

38:07.039 --> 38:09.371
What happened?

38:09.372 --> 38:10.871
Where are the others?

38:10.872 --> 38:14.079
Raven, we need
to send a raven.

38:14.080 --> 38:15.872
Get the maester, now!

38:57.331 --> 38:58.580
Thoros?

39:02.122 --> 39:03.580
Thoros.

39:21.705 --> 39:23.914
They say it's one
of the better ways to go.

39:37.788 --> 39:42.455
Lord of Light,
show us the way.

39:42.456 --> 39:45.997
Come to us in our darkness and
lead Your servant into the light.

39:51.414 --> 39:53.372
We have to
burn his body.

39:56.414 --> 39:58.787
We'll all be
close behind him

39:58.788 --> 40:02.663
unless the Lord of Light is kind
enough to send us a bit of fire.

40:11.705 --> 40:14.205
Lord of Light,

40:14.206 --> 40:16.871
come to us
in our darkness,

40:16.872 --> 40:19.580
for the night is dark
and full of terrors.

40:43.497 --> 40:45.372
We'll all freeze soon.

40:46.580 --> 40:48.497
And so will the water.

40:52.247 --> 40:55.205
When you killed
the white walker,

40:55.206 --> 40:59.079
almost all the dead
that followed it fell.

40:59.080 --> 41:00.954
Why?

41:00.955 --> 41:03.205
Maybe he was the one
who turned them.

41:03.206 --> 41:06.579
We can go
for the walkers.

41:06.580 --> 41:09.372
- Maybe we'll stand a chance.
- No.

41:10.914 --> 41:13.705
We need to take
that thing back with us.

41:16.872 --> 41:19.330
There's a raven flying
for Dragonstone now.

41:19.331 --> 41:22.746
Daenerys is
our only chance.

41:22.747 --> 41:25.705
No.
There's another.

41:28.372 --> 41:29.747
Kill him.

41:30.872 --> 41:32.580
He turned them all.

41:36.914 --> 41:38.122
You don't understand.

41:39.788 --> 41:41.496
The Lord
brought you back.

41:41.497 --> 41:43.704
He brought me back.

41:43.705 --> 41:46.787
No one else.
Just us.

41:46.788 --> 41:49.164
Did He do it to watch us
freeze to death?

41:51.622 --> 41:54.829
Careful, Beric.
You lost your priest.

41:54.830 --> 41:56.621
This is your last life.

41:56.622 --> 41:59.704
I've been waiting for the
end for a long time.

41:59.705 --> 42:02.371
Maybe the Lord brought
me here to find it.

42:02.372 --> 42:06.246
Every lord I've ever
met's been a cunt.

42:06.247 --> 42:09.122
Don't see why the Lord of Light
should be any different.

42:22.331 --> 42:23.663
My lady.

42:33.955 --> 42:35.871
My lady?

42:35.872 --> 42:39.997
It's an invitation
to King's Landing.

42:46.289 --> 42:48.330
My lady, you are
the Lady of Winterfell.

42:48.331 --> 42:50.913
I am, and you will
represent my interests

42:50.914 --> 42:52.496
at this gathering
as you see them.

42:52.497 --> 42:55.872
They invited you.
They want you there.

42:57.372 --> 42:59.413
I will not set foot
in King's Landing

42:59.414 --> 43:01.996
while Cersei Lannister
is queen.

43:01.997 --> 43:03.704
If they want
another Stark prisoner,

43:03.705 --> 43:05.496
they can come
and take me.

43:05.497 --> 43:08.246
Until then, I'll remain
where I belong.

43:08.247 --> 43:10.163
I have work to do here.

43:13.080 --> 43:14.787
It's not safe.

43:14.788 --> 43:16.621
Ser Jaime
will be there.

43:16.622 --> 43:19.205
You said he treated you
honorably before.

43:19.206 --> 43:21.205
I'm not worried
about me.

43:21.206 --> 43:24.371
It's not safe leaving you
with Littlefinger.

43:24.372 --> 43:26.662
I have many guards
who would happily

43:26.663 --> 43:28.121
imprison him
or behead him

43:28.122 --> 43:29.496
whether or not
you're here.

43:29.497 --> 43:31.704
And you trust
their loyalty?

43:31.705 --> 43:35.371
You trust he hasn't been speaking
to them all behind your back?

43:35.372 --> 43:38.746
Let me at least leave Podrick
behind to watch over you.

43:38.747 --> 43:40.371
He has become
a competent swordsman...

43:40.372 --> 43:44.829
I do not need to be watched
over or minded or cared for.

43:44.830 --> 43:46.079
I'm not a child,

43:46.080 --> 43:48.996
I am the Lady of Winterfell,
and I am home.

43:48.997 --> 43:51.039
This is the safest
place for me.

43:52.372 --> 43:54.537
My lady,

43:54.538 --> 43:57.413
I swore an oath to protect
you and your sister.

43:57.414 --> 44:00.579
- If I abandon you...
- The trip to King's Landing is long, Lady Brienne,

44:00.580 --> 44:03.121
and you won't be
traveling on summer roads.

44:03.122 --> 44:06.247
The sooner you leave, the better
your chances of making it on time.

44:09.747 --> 44:11.080
Yes, my lady.

44:33.997 --> 44:35.954
You can't.

44:35.955 --> 44:37.829
The most important
person in the world

44:37.830 --> 44:40.537
can't fly off to the most
dangerous place in the world.

44:40.538 --> 44:42.579
- Who else can?
- No one.

44:42.580 --> 44:44.579
They knew the risks
when they left.

44:44.580 --> 44:46.140
You can't win the throne
if you're dead.

44:47.622 --> 44:49.662
You can't break the wheel
if you're dead.

44:49.663 --> 44:51.954
So, what would
you have me do?

44:51.955 --> 44:53.746
Nothing.

44:53.747 --> 44:55.830
Sometimes nothing
is the hardest thing to do.

44:58.206 --> 45:01.622
If you die,
we're all lost.

45:03.289 --> 45:06.537
Everyone, everything.

45:06.538 --> 45:10.205
You told me to do nothing
before and I listened to you.

45:10.206 --> 45:11.997
I'm not doing
nothing again.

46:08.705 --> 46:10.830
Dumb cunt.

46:32.039 --> 46:34.414
Oh, fuck.

47:12.955 --> 47:14.497
Fuck it.

48:36.997 --> 48:38.039
Yah!

48:47.372 --> 48:48.747
Yah!

49:08.414 --> 49:09.663
Fall back!

49:11.331 --> 49:14.164
- Fall back!
- Come on!

49:40.414 --> 49:42.330
Help me!

52:38.080 --> 52:39.080
Go!

52:54.497 --> 52:55.497
Jon!

54:46.164 --> 54:47.662
Go!

54:47.663 --> 54:50.164
Go now! Leave!

57:47.080 --> 57:49.038
Uncle Benjen!

57:49.039 --> 57:50.039
How?

57:52.622 --> 57:55.371
- You ride for the pass.
- Come with me.

57:55.372 --> 57:57.330
There's no time.

57:57.331 --> 57:59.206
Go!

59:13.622 --> 59:15.496
We'll meet again,
Clegane.

59:15.497 --> 59:17.830
Fucking hope not.

59:47.456 --> 59:49.663
It's time to go,
Your Grace.

59:51.580 --> 59:53.039
A bit longer.

01:00:16.872 --> 01:00:18.914
Rider approaching!

01:00:27.414 --> 01:00:29.621
Open the gate!

01:02:11.788 --> 01:02:13.788
Not what
you're looking for?

01:02:15.538 --> 01:02:18.955
I have hundreds of men here at
Winterfell, all loyal to me.

01:02:20.747 --> 01:02:22.456
They're not here now.

01:02:24.955 --> 01:02:27.205
What are these?

01:02:27.206 --> 01:02:28.622
My faces.

01:02:31.122 --> 01:02:32.954
Where did
you get them?

01:02:32.955 --> 01:02:37.205
In Braavos, while I was
training to be a Faceless Man.

01:02:37.206 --> 01:02:39.372
What does that mean?

01:02:41.955 --> 01:02:43.871
Back in Braavos,

01:02:43.872 --> 01:02:46.537
before I got
my first face,

01:02:46.538 --> 01:02:48.871
there was a game
I used to play.

01:02:48.872 --> 01:02:51.079
The Game of Faces.

01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:52.871
It's simple...

01:02:52.872 --> 01:02:55.371
I ask you a question
about yourself,

01:02:55.372 --> 01:02:58.787
and you try to make lies
sound like the truth.

01:02:58.788 --> 01:03:01.829
If you fool me,
you win.

01:03:01.830 --> 01:03:05.496
If I catch a lie,
you lose.

01:03:05.497 --> 01:03:07.704
Let's play.

01:03:07.705 --> 01:03:10.787
I don't want to play.

01:03:10.788 --> 01:03:14.579
How do you feel
about Jon being king?

01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:17.746
Is there someone else you think
should rule the North instead of him?

01:03:17.747 --> 01:03:21.662
Those faces,
what are they?

01:03:21.663 --> 01:03:24.038
You want to do
the asking?

01:03:24.039 --> 01:03:26.079
Are you sure?

01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:27.913
The Game of Faces
didn't turn out so well

01:03:27.914 --> 01:03:29.662
for the last person
who asked me questions.

01:03:29.663 --> 01:03:31.622
Tell me
what they are.

01:03:34.747 --> 01:03:37.914
We both wanted to be other
people when we were younger.

01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:41.455
You wanted
to be a queen,

01:03:41.456 --> 01:03:44.747
to sit next to a handsome,
young king on the Iron Throne.

01:03:46.247 --> 01:03:48.537
I wanted to be
a knight,

01:03:48.538 --> 01:03:51.622
to pick up a sword like
Father and go off to battle.

01:03:53.955 --> 01:03:57.787
Neither of us got to be
that other person, did we?

01:03:57.788 --> 01:04:01.414
The world doesn't just let girls
decide what they're going to be.

01:04:02.788 --> 01:04:04.413
But I can now.

01:04:04.414 --> 01:04:07.537
With the faces,
I can choose.

01:04:07.538 --> 01:04:09.830
I can become
someone else.

01:04:11.289 --> 01:04:13.621
Speak in their voice,

01:04:13.622 --> 01:04:15.247
live in their skin.

01:04:17.830 --> 01:04:20.456
I could even
become you.

01:04:27.955 --> 01:04:30.662
I wonder what
it would feel like

01:04:30.663 --> 01:04:32.830
to wear
those pretty dresses...

01:04:34.622 --> 01:04:37.039
to be the Lady
of Winterfell.

01:04:39.497 --> 01:04:41.830
All I'd need
to find out...

01:04:43.955 --> 01:04:45.039
is your face.

01:05:43.914 --> 01:05:45.538
I'm sorry.

01:05:47.872 --> 01:05:49.663
I'm so sorry.

01:06:01.247 --> 01:06:03.538
I wish I could
take it back.

01:06:05.580 --> 01:06:07.580
I wish
we'd never gone.

01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:12.580
I don't.

01:06:14.247 --> 01:06:16.580
If we hadn't gone,
I wouldn't have seen.

01:06:18.580 --> 01:06:20.538
You have to see it
to know.

01:06:22.331 --> 01:06:23.914
Now I know.

01:06:27.289 --> 01:06:30.246
The dragons
are my children.

01:06:30.247 --> 01:06:32.913
They're the only children
I'll ever have.

01:06:32.914 --> 01:06:34.538
Do you understand?

01:06:40.331 --> 01:06:44.746
We are going to destroy
the Night King and his army.

01:06:44.747 --> 01:06:46.622
And we'll do it
together.

01:06:48.538 --> 01:06:50.580
You have my word.

01:06:53.955 --> 01:06:55.414
Thank you, Dany.

01:06:57.247 --> 01:06:58.621
"Dany"?

01:07:00.122 --> 01:07:02.289
Who was the last person
who called me that?

01:07:04.122 --> 01:07:06.954
I'm not sure.
Was it my brother?

01:07:06.955 --> 01:07:09.788
Mm, not the company
you want to keep.

01:07:10.955 --> 01:07:12.497
All right.

01:07:14.289 --> 01:07:15.580
Not "Dany."

01:07:19.788 --> 01:07:21.788
How about "my queen"?

01:07:25.247 --> 01:07:28.621
I'd, uh,
bend the knee, but...

01:07:28.622 --> 01:07:31.787
What about those
who swore allegiance to you?

01:07:31.788 --> 01:07:34.997
They'll all come to see
you for what you are.

01:07:50.830 --> 01:07:52.497
I hope I deserve it.

01:07:54.497 --> 01:07:56.331
You do.

01:08:16.872 --> 01:08:18.537
You should get
some rest.

01:12:13.164 --> 01:12:16.456
There is only one war
that matters. And it is here.
