I offer him back if you renounce
all claims to Jabba's legacy on Tatooine.

22:37.375 --> 22:38.541
BOBA FETT: Release him.

22:43.083 --> 22:44.083
(KRRSANTAN GROWLS)

22:45.166 --> 22:46.583
BOBA FETT: No hard feelings.

22:47.708 --> 22:48.833
It's just business.

22:51.333 --> 22:53.416
Take it from an ex-bounty hunter,

22:53.500 --> 22:55.833
don't work for scugholes.

22:56.500 --> 22:57.708
It's not worth it.

23:10.500 --> 23:12.375
FENNEC SHAND:
You sure that was a good idea?

23:12.458 --> 23:14.000
BOBA FETT: Either that or kill him.

23:14.083 --> 23:16.208
FENNEC SHAND:
Do you believe what the Hutts said?

23:16.291 --> 23:17.833
BOBA FETT: I have no reason
to believe them.

23:17.916 --> 23:21.250
They would benefit from their enemies
fighting one another.

23:21.333 --> 23:23.500
FENNEC SHAND: I'll arrange a meeting
with the Mayor.

23:28.041 --> 23:29.416
It's quite the gift.

23:41.833 --> 23:42.833
(GROWLING SOFTLY)

23:44.416 --> 23:45.625
Why does it just lie there?

23:47.333 --> 23:48.625
It's depressed.

23:52.791 --> 23:56.166
This beast can feel such things?

23:56.250 --> 23:59.625
Rancor are emotionally complex creatures.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.541
Why does it wear blinders?

24:04.500 --> 24:05.708
This one is a calf.

24:06.541 --> 24:08.708
It was bred from champions for fighting.

24:08.791 --> 24:11.500
I saved this one for myself to train.

24:12.666 --> 24:15.208
It imprints on the first human it sees.

24:16.166 --> 24:17.666
Now that we arrived,

24:17.750 --> 24:19.833
I will begin its training.

24:21.166 --> 24:22.250
Can I?

24:23.250 --> 24:27.291
Yes, go ahead.
They are quite peaceful unless threatened.

24:32.333 --> 24:34.375
Whoa, easy.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.250
Easy, boy. That's it.

24:41.291 --> 24:42.916
I think it likes this.

24:43.000 --> 24:44.083
RANCOR KEEPER: It does.

24:45.375 --> 24:47.833
-I will spend more time with it.
-RANCOR KEEPER: You should.

24:47.916 --> 24:51.708
They can become very loving.

24:51.791 --> 24:54.208
I thought they were bred just to fight.

24:54.291 --> 24:57.666
They're powerful fighters,
so that is what most know.

24:58.458 --> 25:01.041
But they form strong bonds
with their owners.

25:01.708 --> 25:04.458
It is said that the Witches of Dathomir

25:04.541 --> 25:07.125
even rode them
through the forest and fens.

25:10.041 --> 25:11.750
I want to learn to ride this one.

25:12.750 --> 25:13.750
You what?

25:13.833 --> 25:15.125
I want to ride it.

25:16.416 --> 25:18.625
I've ridden beasts ten times its size.

25:19.666 --> 25:20.750
Teach me.

25:21.750 --> 25:24.291
It will take
a tremendous amount of discipline.

25:25.375 --> 25:26.583
We begin today.

25:28.625 --> 25:30.166
Here you go.

25:30.250 --> 25:32.333
What are we gonna call you?

25:33.375 --> 25:34.750
Yes.

25:39.375 --> 25:40.500
Stand here.

25:47.125 --> 25:48.208
There.

25:59.833 --> 26:00.916
Easy.

26:26.250 --> 26:29.250
Easy, boy. Easy.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.291
Is this the spot?

26:40.916 --> 26:41.916
(BOBA FETT CHUCKLES)

26:42.875 --> 26:45.208
Oh, yes. You like this.

26:45.916 --> 26:47.291
8D8: Excuse me, Lord Fett.

26:47.375 --> 26:48.791
Not now. I'm busy.

26:48.875 --> 26:51.333
We heard back from the Mayor's office.

26:51.416 --> 26:55.583
He remains completely unavailable
for at least the next 20 days.

26:55.666 --> 26:58.625
Feed the rancor,
a full ronto carcass from the larder.

26:58.708 --> 27:00.583
I think it's hungry.

27:03.041 --> 27:06.916
Tell Fennec to suit up.
We're not waiting for an appointment.

27:07.000 --> 27:08.166
8D8: Yes, Lord Fett.

27:11.458 --> 27:12.541
Don't worry.

27:13.083 --> 27:14.166
He'll be back.

27:43.708 --> 27:45.333
BOBA FETT: We're here to see the Mayor.

27:46.500 --> 27:48.750
We have a few questions for him.

27:50.208 --> 27:51.291
Yes, indeed, uh...

27:53.000 --> 27:59.125
Unfortunately, Mayor Mok Shaiz's schedule
is a bit complicated,

27:59.750 --> 28:01.375
unfortunately, as I recall.

28:02.041 --> 28:04.375
FENNEC SHAND:
If you wish to continue breathing,

28:04.458 --> 28:08.208
I advise you
to weigh your next words carefully.

28:12.208 --> 28:14.208
Hmm...

28:16.125 --> 28:17.416
(SMACKS LIPS)
Umm...

28:19.250 --> 28:22.791
Actually I may be able to rearrange
some of the appointments

28:22.875 --> 28:27.083
that aren't as time sensitive as yours.

28:27.166 --> 28:30.875
Uh, so if you'll excuse me,
I'll see what I'm able to do.

28:32.791 --> 28:35.166
BOBA FETT: That was a bit heavy-handed,
don't you think?

28:35.250 --> 28:37.625
FENNEC SHAND: Do you want the appointment
or not?

28:39.833 --> 28:40.833

He's with the Pykes.

32:07.875 --> 32:08.958
The Mayor's gone.
