WEBVTT

00:14.546 --> 00:15.791
Yo, did you hear that?

00:15.881 --> 00:18.170
Yeah. I've always dug the '80s.

00:21.053 --> 00:22.333
Hey, turn the music back on!

00:22.429 --> 00:24.303
Hey! Shut up, shut up.

00:28.394 --> 00:29.508
Hear that?

00:29.603 --> 00:31.430
Sounds like fireworks.

00:32.356 --> 00:33.980
I don't see any.

00:34.358 --> 00:35.900
That's gunfire.

00:41.115 --> 00:43.736
Well, whatever it was, it's over now.

00:45.160 --> 00:46.405
Not yet.

00:47.413 --> 00:48.693
Look out!

00:57.589 --> 00:59.416
There's no one in it.

01:03.971 --> 01:05.631
Fireworks, my ass.

01:06.265 --> 01:07.925
It's all shot up.

01:59.127 --> 02:00.456
Hey.

02:00.545 --> 02:01.790
Morning. How was your weekend?

02:01.880 --> 02:03.837
- What have we got?
- So much for small talk.

02:03.924 --> 02:05.881
Car crash in Quantico last night.
No fatalities.

02:05.967 --> 02:07.047
Next.

02:07.135 --> 02:09.134
Petty officer caught shoplifting
at Bloomingdale's.

02:09.179 --> 02:12.346
Is there anything worth over $50,000
at Bloomingdale's, DiNozzo?

02:12.432 --> 02:14.639
- I don't think so.
- Then why would we handle it?

02:14.726 --> 02:15.889
Next.

02:15.977 --> 02:18.219
I heard a rumour about an ecstasy ring
at Lejeune.

02:18.313 --> 02:19.724
You heard a rumour?

02:19.815 --> 02:23.397
He's been searching for a case,
any case, since I came in.

02:23.777 --> 02:25.900
"All agents not working active cases

02:25.987 --> 02:27.628
"are to attend
a sexual harassment lecture

02:27.656 --> 02:29.530
"at the NCIS
human resource training centre

02:29.616 --> 02:31.573
"at 0930 hours today."

02:31.660 --> 02:33.320
I cannot sit through another one
of those.

02:33.412 --> 02:34.692
I will shoot myself.

02:34.788 --> 02:38.121
You mean, they actually train you guys
how to harass?

02:39.710 --> 02:41.832
Hey, I'm kidding. Except for Tony.

02:41.920 --> 02:44.482
For the last time, Kate,
I was only trying to get my seat belt on.

02:44.506 --> 02:46.131
Right. Seat belt.

02:48.510 --> 02:49.921
Yeah. Gibbs.

02:52.889 --> 02:54.052
Okay, we're on it.

02:54.141 --> 02:57.058
A dead Navy commander just
washed up on a North Virginia Beach.

02:57.144 --> 02:58.306
Yes!

02:59.312 --> 03:00.344
Shotgun.

03:00.439 --> 03:02.478
I hate when she does that.

03:11.074 --> 03:13.031
Sergeant Linn. L-I?

03:13.118 --> 03:15.027
- L-I-N-N. No "E."
- Okay.

03:15.787 --> 03:17.614
Gibbs. NCIS.

03:17.706 --> 03:19.782
Well, it's about time
you guys showed up.

03:19.875 --> 03:23.824
We've been running between the body
and his boat all night long.

03:24.337 --> 03:28.335
Boat crashed ashore right in the middle
of a beach-blanket bingo.

03:29.551 --> 03:31.211
Hard to believe,

03:31.303 --> 03:34.588
Navy commander getting mixed up
in stuff like this.

03:34.806 --> 03:36.265
Stuff like what?

03:36.349 --> 03:37.678
Drug running.

03:37.768 --> 03:42.394
DEA's working two dead drug dealers
three miles north of here at Fort Story.

03:42.522 --> 03:45.192
Three miles up the beach,
and you tied it to the commander?

03:45.275 --> 03:47.813
They're all shot up. So is his boat.

03:48.111 --> 03:50.020
Got to be a connection.

03:54.993 --> 03:56.452
And you are?

03:56.536 --> 03:59.158
Diane Fontaine, WXEK News.

03:59.247 --> 04:00.725
I'd like to ask you some questions...

04:00.749 --> 04:02.492
- DiNozzo!
- Yeah.

04:03.668 --> 04:06.835
Escort Miss Fontaine
off our crime scene, please.

04:07.339 --> 04:08.833
Miss Fontaine.

04:10.509 --> 04:11.884
Let's go, guys.

04:11.968 --> 04:15.005
Sergeant Linn, is it?

04:16.014 --> 04:19.596
You in the habit of convicting people
before the investigation starts?

04:19.684 --> 04:21.095
What? Hey, no. I...

04:21.185 --> 04:22.561
What have we got, Gibbs?

04:22.646 --> 04:25.315
Commander's wallet
with this sergeant's prints.

04:25.398 --> 04:28.565
You removed a wallet from a body
without gloves?

04:28.652 --> 04:30.027
I had to get the vic's name.

04:30.111 --> 04:32.567
He's not a vic. He's a victim.

04:33.323 --> 04:35.150
Where did you learn
crime scene procedure

04:35.242 --> 04:36.902
watching Kojak reruns?

04:36.993 --> 04:39.069
Okay, now just hold on there. I...

04:39.162 --> 04:41.285
Duck, I'll see you at the crime scene.

04:41.373 --> 04:43.412
All right, let's start at the beginning.

04:43.500 --> 04:46.785
You tell me what you did
when you got here, from the top.

05:03.645 --> 05:06.017
Looks like a herd of elephants
went through here.

05:06.106 --> 05:08.513
Just one fat local Leo.

05:08.608 --> 05:10.850
Here, Kate, bag this. I'll do the photos.

05:10.944 --> 05:12.522
Tony told me what to do.

05:12.612 --> 05:15.364
Tony doesn't tell you what to do. I do.

05:17.200 --> 05:19.952
Your elephant said
the commander's boat got shot up.

05:20.036 --> 05:22.824
Why don't you grab an extra kit
from the truck and work that scene?

05:22.914 --> 05:25.286
- By myself?
- You need help?

05:25.375 --> 05:27.035
No. I got it.

05:32.173 --> 05:34.711
Hey, and have it towed back
to the garage when you're done.

05:34.801 --> 05:37.588
And get the witness reports
while you're at it.

05:37.679 --> 05:39.885
I need more assignments
like that, boss.

05:39.973 --> 05:42.298
- Score her number?
- Oh, yeah.

05:43.018 --> 05:45.224
Do you think he was shot or drowned?

05:45.312 --> 05:47.470
Well, either way, he's dead.

05:48.398 --> 05:50.225
It's too bad. Good guy.

05:50.775 --> 05:53.942
He got you out
of that sexual harassment lecture.

05:54.404 --> 05:56.231
I'd rather be at the lecture.

05:56.323 --> 05:58.315
That man is an imbecile!

05:58.408 --> 06:00.650
He shouldn't be
a school crossing guard.

06:00.744 --> 06:02.072
Here, move.

06:02.746 --> 06:03.908
Haven't heard you this pissed

06:03.997 --> 06:06.286
since you shoved
that French flic off a cliff, Duck.

06:06.374 --> 06:08.497
What, you shoved a French cop
over a cliff?

06:08.585 --> 06:11.954
- There was a lake below.
- 60 feet below.

06:12.839 --> 06:15.412
Duck, this crime scene's a mess.
Can we move the body?

06:15.508 --> 06:18.426
Why not? The imbecile obviously has.

06:19.012 --> 06:22.297
Let's turn him over,
see if he was shot in the back.

06:27.270 --> 06:30.057
Guess we can rule out
accidental drowning.

06:31.650 --> 06:33.108
Oh, my friend,

06:33.818 --> 06:36.060
even if he'd survived the water

06:36.488 --> 06:38.646
he would never have walked again.

06:40.075 --> 06:41.450
DEA found a couple of bodies

06:41.534 --> 06:43.326
up at Fort Story
that might be tied to this.

06:43.411 --> 06:46.697
At least they know
not to contaminate a crime scene.

06:48.124 --> 06:51.789
Hey, you two clean this up, bag him,

06:52.671 --> 06:54.295
meet us up there.

06:55.256 --> 06:57.296
Well, it gives you a warm feeling,
doesn't it?

06:57.384 --> 06:58.463
What?

06:58.551 --> 07:02.086
Knowing Gibbs trusts us
with a contaminated crime scene.

07:03.640 --> 07:06.427
Come on, man, let's get him out of here.

07:16.319 --> 07:17.979
This must be him.

07:18.822 --> 07:21.313
- Special Agent Gibbs?
- Yeah.

07:21.408 --> 07:23.281
Sergeant Linn radioed you were coming.

07:23.368 --> 07:25.325
- Agent Ken Fuller, DEA.
- How are you?

07:25.412 --> 07:27.451
This is Captain Bradstone, Army CID.

07:27.539 --> 07:29.163
Our ME, Dr Mallard.

07:29.249 --> 07:31.158
Agent Fuller, Captain.

07:31.793 --> 07:34.498
Looks like your Navy man fell in
with a bad crowd.

07:34.587 --> 07:37.838
Gibbs, this scene is pristine.

07:38.174 --> 07:39.918
We're not amateurs.

07:40.427 --> 07:42.135
Who says they're connected?

07:42.220 --> 07:45.470
How many guys you know go out fishing
in the middle of the night?

07:45.557 --> 07:46.671
Me.

07:46.766 --> 07:49.340
Well, I guarantee you
these two guys didn't.

07:49.436 --> 07:52.555
They meet up with cargo ships
off the coast to bring in coke.

07:52.647 --> 07:54.355
Where's their boat?

07:54.649 --> 07:56.024
There's a drug war going on.

07:56.109 --> 07:58.398
I figured they got jacked for the boat
and the coke.

07:58.486 --> 08:00.395
Captain, is CID working
this crime scene?

08:00.488 --> 08:02.196
ME's not available till tomorrow.

08:02.282 --> 08:06.326
And since this may have
something to do with your Navy officer,

08:06.411 --> 08:09.447
Army has no objection
to NCIS and DEA working it.

08:09.539 --> 08:12.990
- Just send us all your reports.
- Yep. Thanks, captain.

08:13.835 --> 08:15.875
It's okay to touch, Duck?

08:16.171 --> 08:18.044
You have my permission.

08:30.560 --> 08:34.308
How many drug dealers you know
dump the bodies and the cash?

08:39.861 --> 08:41.024
Thanks for waiting, guys.

08:41.111 --> 08:43.520
Chain of custody, Kate.
You had to stay with the boat.

08:43.615 --> 08:45.821
- I'm not stupid, Gibbs.
- Never said you were.

08:45.909 --> 08:49.112
I didn't have to ride in the tow truck
with that boat, now, did I?

08:49.204 --> 08:51.611
You do this to all the newbies,
or just the females?

08:51.706 --> 08:53.331
Do we look like sexists?

08:53.416 --> 08:55.811
Ask me who's buried in Grant's tomb.
It's a tougher question.

08:55.835 --> 08:57.958
Okay, okay, fun's over.
Give me the highlights.

08:58.046 --> 09:00.881
Nine students from UVA
were having a beach party.

09:00.965 --> 09:03.088
Around 0230,
they heard what they first thought

09:03.176 --> 09:04.504
was fireworks out on the water.

09:04.594 --> 09:05.757
Gunfire.

09:05.845 --> 09:07.304
Good guess, Tony.

09:07.388 --> 09:10.389
The Whaler had six holes in its stern,
two in the engine housing.

09:10.475 --> 09:11.554
Commander was running.

09:11.643 --> 09:14.478
Probably from a larger boat
they heard racing up the coast.

09:14.562 --> 09:17.599
About 15 seconds later,
the Mary Celeste came roaring

09:17.690 --> 09:19.043
out of the dark and onto the beach.

09:19.067 --> 09:21.003
- Scared the hell out of them.
- What did you find on the boat?

09:21.027 --> 09:24.147
Fishing gear, bait,
coffee thermos, ham sandwich.

09:24.239 --> 09:26.112
I logged everything, sent it to Abby.

09:26.199 --> 09:27.444
No drugs?

09:27.742 --> 09:30.031
No. Is there a drug connection?

09:30.328 --> 09:31.870
DEA thinks so.

09:31.955 --> 09:34.493
Two dealers floated ashore last night
at Fort Story.

09:34.582 --> 09:35.780
Aerated.

09:35.959 --> 09:37.311
Well, there were no drugs
on the Whaler.

09:37.335 --> 09:38.615
You sure?

09:38.753 --> 09:42.585
I knew a granny in Baltimore,
hid a kilo of "H" in her horse's rectum.

09:42.674 --> 09:44.797
No horse on the boat, Tony.

09:45.260 --> 09:47.336
We working a joint investigation
with the DEA?

09:47.428 --> 09:49.587
Yep. Ducky's got all three bodies
in autopsy

09:49.681 --> 09:51.389
- and Abby's drying the money.
- Money?

09:51.474 --> 09:52.910
The dealers were found
with fanny packs

09:52.934 --> 09:54.677
stuffed with wet Franklins.

09:54.769 --> 09:56.014
Well, I got to see those bills.

09:56.104 --> 09:57.302
Why?

09:57.480 --> 09:59.354
I did work for the Secret Service.

09:59.440 --> 10:02.607
We tend to get all hot and bothered
over large sums of $100 bills.

10:02.694 --> 10:04.900
Is that what does it for you?

10:05.155 --> 10:08.689
What does it for me, Tony,
is a mystery that you will never solve.

10:08.783 --> 10:10.443
I know the answer.

10:11.202 --> 10:12.400
Grant.

10:13.121 --> 10:15.244
Why do I feel like
a high-school principal?

10:15.331 --> 10:16.411
I don't know, boss.

10:16.499 --> 10:19.453
If those college kids are right,
whoever shot the commander

10:19.544 --> 10:22.628
ran into the Chesapeake
or up the Maryland coast.

10:22.714 --> 10:23.828
Find out which.

10:23.923 --> 10:25.299
I'm on it.

10:26.926 --> 10:28.586
The South Pacific has a number

10:28.678 --> 10:31.050
of different refreshments.
I remember one.

10:31.139 --> 10:33.677
Where was it? New Guinea or Timor?

10:33.766 --> 10:35.047
Well, whatever the case,

10:35.143 --> 10:38.476
the natives had this
delightfully refreshing drink.

10:38.563 --> 10:39.808
It wasn't till years later

10:39.898 --> 10:41.807
I discovered it was made
from a mixture

10:41.900 --> 10:43.442
of rum punch

10:43.860 --> 10:46.267
and water buffalo urine.

10:47.947 --> 10:50.485
To Abby, please, Gerald.

10:52.035 --> 10:55.119
They'd never seen a white man,
and my life was in jeopardy until...

10:55.205 --> 10:57.078
I've got to report in.

10:57.415 --> 10:59.704
There's a phone over there.

11:02.503 --> 11:03.583
Oh, well.

11:03.922 --> 11:06.163
You'll enjoy this, Commander.

11:07.508 --> 11:09.916
As I was saying, my life was in jeopardy

11:10.011 --> 11:13.795
until I cured the chief's wife
of a terrible yeast infection.

11:13.890 --> 11:16.345
I can see why you don't talk much.

11:17.602 --> 11:20.009
I'm sorry. Did you say something?

11:22.357 --> 11:23.732
Commander Farrell

11:23.816 --> 11:27.185
a Navy RO TC instructor
at Hampton Roads

11:27.278 --> 11:29.686
was found on North Virginia
Beach this morning

11:29.781 --> 11:32.698
near the bodies
of two alleged drug dealers.

11:32.784 --> 11:36.034
Commander Farrell,
a founder of Urban Lights,

11:36.120 --> 11:38.742
a night basketball anti-drug programme

11:38.831 --> 11:41.702
may have been involved
in smuggling illegal drugs

11:41.793 --> 11:43.584
into the Norfolk area.

11:43.711 --> 11:47.709
Expressing shock and outrage,
a Community Centre spokesperson

11:47.799 --> 11:50.753
said the Urban Lights
basketball programme

11:50.843 --> 11:52.254
will be suspended

11:52.387 --> 11:55.222
on all Norfolk community courts...

12:15.836 --> 12:17.663
You gonna kick our asses out?

12:17.755 --> 12:19.913
- Nope.
- You Five-O, ain't you?

12:20.674 --> 12:22.632
- Sort of.
- Sort of?

12:23.928 --> 12:26.051
Yeah, right. I smell bacon.

12:27.640 --> 12:29.383
Big fence to climb over.

12:29.475 --> 12:30.969
Not if you got hops.

12:31.060 --> 12:33.136
What do you want, One Time?

12:33.896 --> 12:35.972
Get this lock off the gate.

12:36.273 --> 12:38.729
Shouldn't have to hop a fence
to play some basketball.

12:38.818 --> 12:40.561
You got heat to do something about it?

12:40.653 --> 12:42.064
Maybe you do.

12:42.613 --> 12:43.811
We did.

12:45.950 --> 12:47.408
That you did.

12:47.868 --> 12:49.991
It'd be better with lights.

12:52.248 --> 12:54.074
Answer me one question.

12:54.166 --> 12:55.993
Get the right answer,

12:56.085 --> 12:59.169
you have my word
these lights will get back on.

12:59.255 --> 13:02.256
- Shoot, Five-O.
- Slow up, Bobby.

13:02.341 --> 13:04.464
What you mean, right answer?

13:04.677 --> 13:07.547
Give me the wrong answer,
I can't help you.

13:08.180 --> 13:09.972
Get out of here, Fed.

13:10.057 --> 13:11.551
What you doing, bro?

13:11.642 --> 13:14.726
He's a narc, man. He's trying to get us
to say Seadog was dealing.

13:14.812 --> 13:17.813
So, tell the bacon what he wants to hear
if it gets us our lights back.

13:17.898 --> 13:19.179
I'm not diming on Seadog.

13:19.275 --> 13:21.682
Man, he's 6 feet below. He won't know.

13:21.777 --> 13:23.106
Yo, I will.

13:29.201 --> 13:32.202
Man, you too old to hop wire.

13:33.289 --> 13:34.949
Want the question?

13:36.041 --> 13:37.584
I know the question.

13:38.210 --> 13:39.669
You not gonna like the answer.

13:39.753 --> 13:41.034
I will if it's the truth.

13:41.130 --> 13:42.790
Hey, we could lie.

13:43.090 --> 13:45.083
How you gonna know, Fed?

13:46.051 --> 13:47.427
I'll know.

13:53.893 --> 13:56.051
For the 1990 to '96 series,

13:56.145 --> 13:58.814
Treasury introduced micro-printing
as a counter measure

13:58.898 --> 14:00.855
against computer printers and copiers.

14:00.941 --> 14:02.294
Good enough to stop high-school kids,

14:02.318 --> 14:05.817
but not rogue countries
and a few of the world's top forgers.

14:09.450 --> 14:11.407
It's got one, tiny flaw.

14:12.369 --> 14:14.409
- I'll be damned.
- What?

14:14.496 --> 14:18.115
You'd think a man that can find heroin
in a horse's ass could find this.

14:18.209 --> 14:19.952
You reached into a horse's ass?

14:20.044 --> 14:21.704
I had a glove on.

14:23.714 --> 14:26.419
"United States."
What's wrong with that?

14:27.051 --> 14:28.593
Read it, again.

14:31.722 --> 14:32.837
"Untied States."

14:32.932 --> 14:35.055
So the forger was dyslexic.

14:35.142 --> 14:36.885
Not just the forger.

14:38.312 --> 14:40.272
Who would pay drug runners
with counterfeit money?

14:40.356 --> 14:41.791
I know you don't want
to hear this, Gibbs,

14:41.815 --> 14:44.485
but your commander could've bought
with bogus bills.

14:44.568 --> 14:46.027
That's why they killed him.

14:46.111 --> 14:48.816
Commander Farrell
was not dealing drugs.

14:49.281 --> 14:51.819
Tony, where did you find that boat
was headed

14:51.909 --> 14:53.094
when they dumped the two bodies?

14:53.118 --> 14:54.696
Well, according to the tide charts,

14:54.787 --> 14:56.447
since the bodies washed up
at Fort Story,

14:56.538 --> 14:58.946
the boat had to have been
entering the bay.

14:59.041 --> 15:00.784
That narrows it down.

15:01.377 --> 15:02.705
Even if we knew the marina

15:02.795 --> 15:05.464
we still don't have a name
or description of the boat.

15:05.547 --> 15:07.042
Well, let's talk to someone who does.

15:07.132 --> 15:09.754
Can you pull in the boss
of the dead drug runners?

15:09.843 --> 15:11.124
Trujillo?

15:11.220 --> 15:14.137
Sure, for as long as it takes him
to get his lawyers down here.

15:14.223 --> 15:16.975
Bring in that dirtbag
that runs the rival gang, too.

15:17.059 --> 15:19.930
These aren't a couple of sailors
caught buying grass.

15:20.020 --> 15:22.374
These are pros. They won't tell you
the name of their mothers.

15:22.398 --> 15:23.643
No offence,

15:23.732 --> 15:27.066
but maybe you just don't use
the right tone of voice with them.

15:27.152 --> 15:28.611
Bring them in.

15:34.034 --> 15:36.406
Anybody at your old agency
you can trust?

15:36.495 --> 15:37.610
Trust to what?

15:37.705 --> 15:40.345
Find out who forged these notes
and where they've been circulating.

15:40.416 --> 15:41.826
Shouldn't be a problem.

15:41.917 --> 15:43.993
Without telling their boss.

15:45.879 --> 15:47.124
That a problem?

15:47.214 --> 15:49.835
Gee, now, why would that
be a problem?

16:00.561 --> 16:02.684
- Great.
- What are you doing?

16:02.813 --> 16:04.889
- Communicating.
- Abby signs?

16:04.982 --> 16:07.354
Yeah. Yeah, her parents were deaf.

16:07.526 --> 16:09.234
Where'd you learn?

16:10.237 --> 16:13.357
She just said that the AK-47 round
that killed the commander

16:13.449 --> 16:16.236
came from the same weapon
that killed our two drug dealers.

16:16.327 --> 16:19.411
Yeah, why didn't she just come out
and say that?

16:21.123 --> 16:22.286
Hey, thank you.

16:22.374 --> 16:25.044
That was fun, Gibbs.
You still got the touch.

16:26.170 --> 16:27.415
She's got more.

16:27.504 --> 16:29.711
I picked up GSR
on the smugglers' hands.

16:29.798 --> 16:31.707
Their weapons were fired
really recently.

16:31.800 --> 16:33.793
The commander's was clean.

16:37.222 --> 16:39.429
They said Seadog didn't deal.

16:40.392 --> 16:41.555
Seadog?

16:48.776 --> 16:49.855
Who's Seadog?

16:49.943 --> 16:52.565
Did you get that reporter's number
or was it just talk?

16:52.654 --> 16:53.817
Gibbs.

16:54.573 --> 16:57.093
- See if she's available for lunch.
- Love to. Can I expense it?

16:57.159 --> 16:58.653
No. But I will.

16:59.912 --> 17:02.533
How do you sign,
"I should have known?"

17:11.382 --> 17:14.915
You kick me off the beach
and now you play the gentleman.

17:15.511 --> 17:17.752
You must want something real bad.

17:17.846 --> 17:19.886
Oh, yeah. Bubbles okay?

17:20.348 --> 17:21.428
Fine.

17:25.229 --> 17:27.352
The panini here reminds me of Naples.

17:27.439 --> 17:30.226
No bread. I'm on TV, remember?

17:30.317 --> 17:32.559
So, is it true the camera puts 10 pounds
on you?

17:32.653 --> 17:34.277
Five, in my case.

17:35.781 --> 17:37.489
What do you want, Agent Gibbs?

17:37.574 --> 17:38.772
Jethro.

17:39.118 --> 17:40.944
- You're kidding.
- No.

17:44.123 --> 17:46.530
Have a nice lunch.
Get to know you a little.

17:46.625 --> 17:47.953
Here it comes.

17:48.043 --> 17:49.668
Tell you a story.

17:51.630 --> 17:52.828
Jethro.

17:53.132 --> 17:54.792
Commander Farrell's old news.

17:54.883 --> 17:56.876
I'm onto fresher bodies.

17:57.302 --> 17:59.010
Aren't you interested in getting it right?

17:59.096 --> 18:01.634
I am. My producer isn't.

18:01.723 --> 18:03.515
He's interested in ratings.

18:03.600 --> 18:05.640
At the price of a man's reputation?

18:05.727 --> 18:08.479
I didn't report anything
that wasn't told to me by the cops.

18:08.564 --> 18:10.106
You didn't dig deeper.

18:10.190 --> 18:12.515
I couldn't. You threw me out.

18:16.447 --> 18:18.273
What if I let you in?

18:23.704 --> 18:25.246
How was lunch?

18:27.374 --> 18:29.947
- They here yet?
- Downstairs, waiting.

18:33.005 --> 18:36.124
You're not going to tell me about lunch,
are you?

18:36.216 --> 18:37.331
No.

18:39.761 --> 18:42.846
You should wash your hands with soap
for saying that.

18:47.352 --> 18:48.597
Special Agent Gibbs.

18:48.687 --> 18:51.723
Frank Trujillo and Darryl Wilkins
as requested.

18:53.358 --> 18:54.734
Over here.

19:13.086 --> 19:15.838
That a glimmer of recognition
I just saw?

19:16.632 --> 19:19.039
It seems these two belong to you.

19:19.843 --> 19:21.670
Well, good. I can slide, right?

19:21.762 --> 19:23.671
Not if you killed them.

19:24.723 --> 19:27.048
Never scuffed anyone in my life.

19:28.060 --> 19:30.017
I'm the only one
not finding anything funny here.

19:30.103 --> 19:31.562
You know why?

19:34.274 --> 19:35.899
This naval commander

19:35.984 --> 19:39.151
didn't die a natural death
or fighting for his country.

19:40.447 --> 19:43.567
He died in a crossfire
between you two dirtbags.

19:44.493 --> 19:46.153
I want my lawyer.

19:50.624 --> 19:52.700
This was found on these two boys
in the cooler.

19:52.793 --> 19:53.955
It's counterfeit.

19:54.044 --> 19:57.745
Comes from a foreign government
known to support terrorism.

19:59.258 --> 20:00.835
That makes you two dirtbags

20:00.926 --> 20:04.295
suspected enemy combatants
under the Patriot Act.

20:06.682 --> 20:09.089
Tony, read them their rights.

20:09.268 --> 20:12.268
Put them on the first Navy transport
to Gitmo.

20:12.479 --> 20:14.472
You do not have the right
to remain silent.

20:14.565 --> 20:16.723
You do not have the right to an attorney.

20:16.817 --> 20:19.771
Gibbs, we don't know
who counterfeited that money.

20:19.861 --> 20:22.435
Even if it does come from a country
friendly to terrorists,

20:22.531 --> 20:24.239
you can't send them to Gitmo.

20:24.324 --> 20:26.116
They're US citizens.

20:26.201 --> 20:29.237
Do you understand these rights
you don't have?

20:33.667 --> 20:34.947
Watch me.

20:43.561 --> 20:45.221
Your bluff worked.

20:45.980 --> 20:47.890
Trujillo wants to talk.

20:48.108 --> 20:51.192
He really believed you'd ship him off
to Gitmo.

20:53.905 --> 20:56.574
The secret of a good bluff,
Agent Fuller,

20:56.658 --> 20:58.235
is not to bluff.

20:58.868 --> 21:01.822
The two men on ice are brothers,

21:02.539 --> 21:05.742
Jesus and Carlos Garcia.
They run two of my boats.

21:06.042 --> 21:09.910
Fishing's been poor lately
'cause of poachers in my waters.

21:10.755 --> 21:13.425
Your waters?
You own the oceans, Frank?

21:15.427 --> 21:19.507
So, I kept my boats in port
until our little dispute

21:21.641 --> 21:23.266
could be settled.

21:23.643 --> 21:26.134
I can recommend a federal mediator.

21:26.813 --> 21:29.565
Sorry. Couldn't resist. You were saying?

21:30.066 --> 21:31.893
Yesterday, I learned
that the Garcia brothers

21:31.985 --> 21:35.852
took one of my boats out Sunday night
and never came back.

21:36.614 --> 21:38.607
Without asking you, jefe?

21:43.830 --> 21:47.530
You ain't balling no more
when your marks don't ask, Frank.

21:47.959 --> 21:50.830
You can ride out
with that salsa spit, okay?

21:53.131 --> 21:54.376
Believe that, Darryl?

21:54.466 --> 21:57.217
There's no way he wouldn't come
with the real in front of my grille.

21:57.302 --> 21:59.211
"Real in front of my grille."

21:59.304 --> 22:00.846
I got to remember that.

22:00.930 --> 22:02.425
You know what that tells me?

22:02.515 --> 22:05.433
As far as you were concerned,
that boat was Trujillo's,

22:05.518 --> 22:06.894
fishing in disputed waters.

22:06.978 --> 22:09.599
Man, I wasn't hip till this narc
dragged me down here.

22:09.689 --> 22:12.773
Swear on my seeds, okay,
we ain't whacked them.

22:14.402 --> 22:17.486
He's not lying to you. He didn't kill them.

22:19.532 --> 22:22.106
This is good, Tony. I mean, it's good.

22:22.202 --> 22:25.867
You got two rival dirtbags
vouching for each other.

22:26.706 --> 22:28.615
You think Garcia
chartered out Frank's boat

22:28.708 --> 22:30.250
to some sports fishermen from Iowa?

22:30.335 --> 22:32.078
Would they want to do anything legal?

22:32.170 --> 22:35.503
Nope, no. They were probably
hauling drug smugglers.

22:35.840 --> 22:38.129
- Or illegals.
- Or running guns.

22:39.636 --> 22:41.675
We miss any potential charters?

22:41.763 --> 22:44.005
I told you everything I know.

22:45.099 --> 22:46.843
Well, can I go now?

22:47.352 --> 22:48.680
Por favor?

22:50.688 --> 22:52.099
Yeah, sure.

22:53.650 --> 22:55.523
Once we have the boat.

23:00.240 --> 23:02.232
Help me out here, Darryl.

23:04.160 --> 23:07.659
He's got GPS locators in all his boats.

23:08.998 --> 23:11.750
Now, why didn't you tell us that, Frank?

23:13.753 --> 23:15.911
I like to handle my own problems.

23:16.005 --> 23:18.675
Not this time. This one is ours.

23:23.680 --> 23:25.340
May I use your phone?

23:25.431 --> 23:26.511
Yep.

23:31.020 --> 23:33.179
What's the name of the boat?

23:38.570 --> 23:40.776
Can Tony sniff for drugs now?

23:41.197 --> 23:42.312
Tony?

23:43.116 --> 23:45.025
Some coincidence, huh?

23:45.785 --> 23:48.703
Deck's been hosed,
but there's blood residue.

23:49.289 --> 23:52.455
Get me some swabs, DiNozzo.
I'll start the cabin.

23:52.792 --> 23:54.619
Bet he's a real stud.

23:55.795 --> 23:57.337
He's neutered.

24:46.888 --> 24:48.382
Holy hell!

24:50.767 --> 24:52.427
What kind of engine's in this thing?

24:52.518 --> 24:55.934
Drug-runner special.
Blown 502 putting out 800 horses.

25:00.151 --> 25:01.978
Main cabin's a mess.

25:02.236 --> 25:03.481
Blood stains, bullet holes.

25:03.571 --> 25:05.131
Found some bloody bandages
on the bunks.

25:05.156 --> 25:07.481
- One of them's hurting.
- Can I search for drugs?

25:07.575 --> 25:09.484
We're just getting started.

25:09.661 --> 25:11.541
What you can do is check
with the marina office.

25:11.579 --> 25:13.073
See if they paid a mooring fee.

25:13.164 --> 25:14.243
Strike out at that

25:14.332 --> 25:16.143
and start canvassing the marina
and find out someone...

25:16.167 --> 25:19.618
Gibbs, I'm a Federal agent.
I know who and what to ask.

25:21.673 --> 25:24.210
I keep forgetting
you're not a dog walker.

25:24.676 --> 25:26.383
That's very funny.

25:27.512 --> 25:29.006
Come on, Tony.

25:36.896 --> 25:38.011
Wow.

25:38.731 --> 25:40.807
They should've hosed down in here.

25:40.900 --> 25:43.023
They did just enough
to avoid attracting attention

25:43.111 --> 25:44.521
of someone walking by.

25:44.612 --> 25:47.732
We're going to be bagging and tagging
for hours.

26:07.135 --> 26:09.044
If I only had the time.

26:14.058 --> 26:15.636
- What?
- You got the time?

26:15.727 --> 26:17.351
My watch is slow.

26:18.896 --> 26:20.474
Going somewhere, DiNozzo?

26:20.565 --> 26:23.056
Yeah. Back to work.

26:36.873 --> 26:38.118
Caitlin.

26:44.255 --> 26:46.497
Glad you could make it, Marcy.

26:48.676 --> 26:50.834
I didn't go over to the dark side.

26:50.928 --> 26:52.126
Sorry.

26:52.263 --> 26:54.884
So, how's it feel not wearing a suit?

26:55.391 --> 26:58.725
I think a bit like mom felt
when she burned her bra.

27:01.147 --> 27:03.982
Where'd you get
those serial numbers, Kate?

27:04.275 --> 27:07.774
I stumbled upon some bogus bills
on a drug case.

27:08.321 --> 27:10.758
The Navy commander who was dealing
to the kids at Urban Lights?

27:10.782 --> 27:12.940
Well, we don't think he was, Marcy.

27:13.034 --> 27:14.825
Teach me to believe the news.

27:14.911 --> 27:16.950
NCIS have the bogus bills?

27:17.038 --> 27:20.288
$65,000 worth of Franklins.
You able to trace them?

27:21.042 --> 27:22.536
Yes, we were.

27:22.835 --> 27:24.994
- We?
- Sorry, Kate.

27:25.338 --> 27:29.418
You know better than to ask anyone
to slip you info on something like this.

27:29.509 --> 27:31.632
We had to involve the FBI.

27:35.598 --> 27:37.057
Agent Todd,

27:37.308 --> 27:39.633
I see you've joined the cowboys.

27:41.813 --> 27:43.639
Nothing from the marina office

27:43.731 --> 27:46.187
but Jenny and Nancy were very helpful.

27:46.317 --> 27:47.977
Jenny and Nancy?

27:48.152 --> 27:50.643
The girls on the sloop over there.

27:51.280 --> 27:53.001
They're sailing that beauty
all the way down

27:53.074 --> 27:55.647
the intercoastal waterway
to Miami for her owner.

27:55.743 --> 27:57.736
All the way to Miami.

27:57.829 --> 28:01.873
They're going to be there by the time
you tell me how they were helpful.

28:03.167 --> 28:05.488
When they docked yesterday,
there was someone on this boat.

28:05.545 --> 28:06.790
You get a description?

28:06.879 --> 28:09.370
Late 20s, glasses, short hair.

28:09.549 --> 28:12.004
Gay or low on testosterone.
They waved.

28:12.093 --> 28:13.207
- He ignored them.
- No way.

28:13.302 --> 28:14.547
That's what I said.

28:14.637 --> 28:16.345
What did they say?

28:16.848 --> 28:18.075
Guy had a couple of cell phones.

28:18.099 --> 28:20.341
When he wasn't making calls,
he was working a laptop.

28:20.434 --> 28:23.008
Then, about 1:00,
Jenny started grilling some prawns.

28:23.104 --> 28:24.681
By the way, they're Aussies.

28:24.772 --> 28:26.646
Aussies. I love...

28:28.067 --> 28:30.273
So Jenny was grilling prawns?

28:31.279 --> 28:33.105
Saw a white van pull up here.

28:33.197 --> 28:37.029
The guy with the glasses
was really excited to see the driver.

28:37.159 --> 28:38.784
She said they hugged a lot.

28:38.870 --> 28:39.949
Gay.

28:40.037 --> 28:41.318
Describe the driver?

28:41.414 --> 28:43.537
Same look as glasses,
without the glasses.

28:43.624 --> 28:46.874
They brought some heavy suitcases
from the boat to the van,

28:46.961 --> 28:50.128
then they helped a third guy
with a bandaged leg to the van.

28:50.214 --> 28:52.337
He must've been in the cabin
the whole time.

28:52.425 --> 28:53.670
Then they drove off.

28:53.759 --> 28:55.835
Anything more on the van,
other than the colour?

28:55.928 --> 28:59.712
Nope. I tried. All they could remember
was that it was white.

29:01.893 --> 29:03.850
Can Tony sniff the boat, now?

29:04.437 --> 29:06.014
It's all yours.

29:06.606 --> 29:07.981
It sure is.

29:10.359 --> 29:11.770
What's that?

29:12.445 --> 29:14.437
Asset forfeiture notice.

29:15.698 --> 29:17.406
Don't you have to find drugs first?

29:17.491 --> 29:20.409
I used to worry about rules like that.
Then I met you guys.

29:20.494 --> 29:23.614
Come on, Tony, up.
All right, good boy. Hold on.

29:23.873 --> 29:26.162
I'm telling you, boss. Aussie chicks.

29:26.250 --> 29:28.077
Definitely different
than American chicks.

29:28.169 --> 29:30.660
A guy's even got
to approach them differently.

29:30.755 --> 29:33.328
I'd have gotten more
than the colour of the van out of them.

29:33.424 --> 29:36.342
I know I'm going to regret this, DiNozzo,

29:38.262 --> 29:40.753
but follow up on Fuller's interview.

29:47.271 --> 29:49.596
Hey, get anything from your friend?

29:49.690 --> 29:50.769
Yep.

29:52.610 --> 29:54.602
You disappoint me, Kate.

29:55.529 --> 29:57.107
Me, too, Gibbs.

29:57.198 --> 30:00.115
I thought she knew better
than to trade down.

30:03.162 --> 30:04.704
Is this yours?

30:15.967 --> 30:19.750
You need to seriously rethink
your definition of the word "friend."

30:19.845 --> 30:22.240
If I were in Marcy's shoes,
I would have done the same thing.

30:22.264 --> 30:23.759
Careful, Agent Todd.

30:23.849 --> 30:26.305
You're running out of job options.

30:26.394 --> 30:29.976
Since I once again have the pleasure
of your company, Agent Fornell,

30:30.064 --> 30:33.647
we're into more than phony Franklins
and dead drug dealers.

30:33.734 --> 30:35.063
Much more.

30:35.152 --> 30:37.394
Those serial numbers matched
a batch of bogus bills

30:37.488 --> 30:39.481
passed by 9/11 hijackers.

30:41.325 --> 30:43.733
Your killers aren't drug dealers.

30:44.286 --> 30:45.994
They're terrorists.

30:54.007 --> 30:56.248
Since 9/11, the bureau has compiled

30:56.342 --> 30:58.501
a worldwide terrorist database

30:58.594 --> 31:02.177
incorporating files from over
70 foreign intelligence services.

31:02.265 --> 31:06.512
Any prints lifted from that boat
that are left by known terrorists

31:06.602 --> 31:07.931
will get a hit.

31:08.021 --> 31:11.306
Why didn't we have access
to this database, Charlie?

31:11.733 --> 31:13.191
All you had to do was ask, Tom.

31:13.276 --> 31:16.526
If your agent Fornell hadn't been here
to get us priority,

31:16.612 --> 31:18.486
my feeling is I'd still be asking.

31:18.573 --> 31:20.980
Perhaps I should leave him there?

31:21.451 --> 31:23.527
I don't think that's necessary, Charlie.

31:23.619 --> 31:26.823
Just hardwire us
into this terrorist database.

31:27.123 --> 31:30.408
Sorry, Tom. We like to monitor
who's accessing our data.

31:30.501 --> 31:33.288
Hard to keep a list like this
to yourself, Charlie.

31:33.379 --> 31:34.500
I'm sure when our colleagues

31:34.589 --> 31:36.996
who head the other agencies
hear of this

31:37.091 --> 31:39.926
they're going to be
pounding on your door.

31:41.345 --> 31:44.133
Hell, why not?
We're all on the same team.

31:44.974 --> 31:48.841
But, Tom, if any of our colleagues
hear about this

31:48.936 --> 31:50.265
I'll pull your plug

31:50.354 --> 31:51.635
and NCIS priority

31:51.731 --> 31:54.815
will follow the Sandusky, Ohio
fire department.

31:56.402 --> 31:59.024
Understood. Thanks, Charlie.

32:00.573 --> 32:01.901
Good luck.

32:03.493 --> 32:05.366
I see where you cowboys
get your chutzpah.

32:05.453 --> 32:07.576
How long to scan the entire database?

32:07.663 --> 32:10.119
Don't know. No one's ever done it.

32:21.344 --> 32:23.835
Nothing like a shrimp on the barby.

32:24.555 --> 32:27.011
Only a Yank would call them shrimp.
They're prawns.

32:27.100 --> 32:28.642
They're prawns.

32:29.602 --> 32:31.808
He sounds like a real ocker,
doesn't he, Jen?

32:31.896 --> 32:33.059
I reckon.

32:33.147 --> 32:34.178
Ocker?

32:34.273 --> 32:35.851
The ridgy-didge.

32:36.400 --> 32:37.859
I need a translator.

32:37.944 --> 32:39.770
You'll get the drift.

32:40.238 --> 32:41.518
Aren't you drinking, Tony?

32:41.614 --> 32:43.571
I'd love to, but.

32:44.033 --> 32:45.362
I'm on duty.

32:45.451 --> 32:48.203
Pretend I'm not here. I know it's hard.

32:49.330 --> 32:52.366
You were sipping wine and grilling

32:52.875 --> 32:54.156
prawns

32:54.335 --> 32:56.209
when the van showed up?

32:56.838 --> 32:58.711
Now, look, this is silly.

32:58.881 --> 33:02.796
Reenacting can jog your memory,
especially your sense of smell.

33:02.885 --> 33:04.427
Come on, Nance.

33:04.887 --> 33:06.381
Give it a go.

33:09.225 --> 33:11.514
We put the prawns on the barby.

33:12.562 --> 33:13.937
We toasted.

33:14.772 --> 33:16.397
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

33:43.342 --> 33:45.252
- You know him?
- No.

33:45.344 --> 33:47.966
The name is Saudi.
Same as most of the 9/11 hijackers.

33:48.055 --> 33:51.590
- What's the red star?
- Active case with a high priority.

33:53.644 --> 33:55.103
He's one of the foreign terrorists

33:55.188 --> 33:57.227
wanted for the UN bombing in Baghdad.

33:57.315 --> 33:58.584
Believed to have slipped out of Iraq

33:58.608 --> 34:01.146
through Syria three weeks ago.
Whereabouts unknown.

34:01.235 --> 34:02.646
Not anymore.

34:06.240 --> 34:07.485
It worked!

34:07.575 --> 34:09.135
I had Jenny and Nancy grill
some prawns.

34:09.159 --> 34:10.760
They don't call them shrimp
in Australia.

34:10.786 --> 34:13.277
Sip a really nice chardonnay
with a wonderful bouquet.

34:13.371 --> 34:14.867
I didn't drink.

34:15.166 --> 34:16.328
Just sniffed.

34:16.417 --> 34:17.561
What the hell's he ranting about?

34:17.585 --> 34:19.743
- I should have known better.
- No, no, no.

34:19.837 --> 34:21.960
Boss, I had the girls do exactly
what they were doing

34:22.047 --> 34:25.831
when the white panel van pulled in,
jog their memory. It worked.

34:25.927 --> 34:28.155
They remembered the driver
was wearing a company uniform.

34:28.179 --> 34:29.507
Water company? Phone company?

34:29.597 --> 34:31.175
Jefferson Power? Vantage Cable?

34:31.264 --> 34:32.889
Milkman? Breadman?

34:32.975 --> 34:34.578
Hell, that white van
could be from any of 100

34:34.601 --> 34:36.808
different commercial,
county or state outfits.

34:36.896 --> 34:38.355
It's a start.

34:38.438 --> 34:39.684
I'm not done.

34:39.815 --> 34:41.668
I pulled this videotape
from the security camera

34:41.692 --> 34:44.478
at the Mobil station
on the road out of the marina.

34:44.570 --> 34:46.610
That's really smart, Tony.

34:47.031 --> 34:48.442
Any guy could have done it.

34:48.532 --> 34:51.202
Guy? Learn to shut up
when you're ahead.

34:51.869 --> 34:54.027
What time did the girls say
they saw the van?

34:54.121 --> 34:55.532
Around 1300.

34:57.625 --> 34:59.867
Are we submitting
to the Sundance Film Festival?

34:59.961 --> 35:02.037
Best terrorist film category.

35:02.129 --> 35:03.292
Sweet.

35:03.673 --> 35:06.211
So, if anyone's interested,
the only prints off the boat

35:06.300 --> 35:07.986
I could match
were the druggies in the cooler.

35:08.010 --> 35:10.382
- Not the commander?
- Negatory.

35:10.471 --> 35:11.672
We got a match on a terrorist.

35:11.722 --> 35:12.837
You didn't tell me that.

35:12.932 --> 35:14.046
Who could get a word in?

35:14.141 --> 35:17.095
I ran those prints through the Bureau.
I got nada.

35:17.186 --> 35:20.140
You did not have access
to the full database.

35:20.898 --> 35:23.733
You're holding out on us.
That is not nice.

35:25.778 --> 35:27.189
- Whoa! There it is.
- Yep.

35:27.280 --> 35:28.738
Run it back.

35:31.659 --> 35:33.283
"Jefferson Power."

35:38.082 --> 35:39.576
Damn it.
Can anybody read that number?

35:39.667 --> 35:40.698
831.

35:40.793 --> 35:42.750
They've gotta be going
after the power grid.

35:42.837 --> 35:45.244
I found traces of C-4 in the stuff
you bagged on the boat.

35:45.339 --> 35:48.755
Thank God. They're just gonna try
to blow something up.

35:50.845 --> 35:52.045
We've been sweating terrorists

35:52.096 --> 35:54.468
hacking into our power grid
distribution software.

35:54.557 --> 35:55.951
That could shut down half the country.

35:55.975 --> 35:59.095
C-4 indicates a hard target,
a power plant,

35:59.186 --> 36:02.887
a substation distribution node,
which are all under tight security

36:02.982 --> 36:04.668
which are about to get
a hell of a lot tighter.

36:04.692 --> 36:07.064
There's a good chance that driver works
for Jefferson Power.

36:07.153 --> 36:09.229
I hope he does.
We'll have him before sundown.

36:09.322 --> 36:10.353
Terrorist alert.

36:10.448 --> 36:13.781
APB on Jefferson Power company
van number 831.

36:13.868 --> 36:15.944
I want to know where it's based,
who's driving it

36:16.037 --> 36:18.278
and I want it in five minutes.

36:18.372 --> 36:19.535
Thanks.

36:20.958 --> 36:23.247
You've all done a terrific job.

36:24.795 --> 36:26.337
I feel like I just kissed my sister.

36:26.422 --> 36:28.213
I didn't know you had a sister, Tony.

36:28.299 --> 36:30.291
I don't. I was fantasizing.

36:30.384 --> 36:32.377
I need music to do that.

36:35.473 --> 36:37.596
Fornell's got target fixation.

36:37.683 --> 36:38.714
Come again?

36:38.809 --> 36:40.968
It's when a fighter pilot gets so fixed
on his target

36:41.062 --> 36:42.971
that he flies right into it.

36:43.522 --> 36:45.314
Like you and women?

36:47.610 --> 36:49.234
That August blackout was caused

36:49.320 --> 36:52.237
by a tree falling
on some power lines, right?

36:52.406 --> 36:53.984
Something like that.

36:54.158 --> 36:57.609
Well, hell, these guys don't need C-4.
An axe'll do.

37:00.206 --> 37:02.697
Okay, here's the timeline
for the August 15 blackout.

37:02.792 --> 37:05.080
Pull it up on the plasma, Kate.

37:06.003 --> 37:08.838
It started at Eastlake, Ohio at 1400

37:08.923 --> 37:11.414
and by the time it reached Indian Point
in Buchanan, New York,

37:11.509 --> 37:14.178
all the Northeast
and most of Canada was dark.

37:15.763 --> 37:18.883
Pull the state's power grid
up off the internet.

37:22.937 --> 37:24.680
Whoa. Look at this.

37:25.731 --> 37:28.566
It says three key failures
in Virginia could cascade

37:28.651 --> 37:30.857
until every state from here
to the Rockies is dark.

37:30.945 --> 37:33.483
Yeah, more than says. It shows how.

37:34.532 --> 37:37.367
Wait, take down those
three flashing nodes simultaneously

37:37.451 --> 37:40.488
and you take out
the entire eastern power grid.

37:41.622 --> 37:44.195
All we have to do is stop them
from taking out one?

37:44.291 --> 37:45.572
It looks that way.

37:45.668 --> 37:48.871
I mean, if any two fail at the same time,
the slack can be picked up.

37:48.963 --> 37:51.205
There will be blackouts,
but it won't cascade.

37:51.298 --> 37:54.134
- Which one do we go for?
- The closest one.

37:54.802 --> 37:56.177
Right here.

38:07.440 --> 38:10.191
Agent Fornell is concentrating agents
on the three key nodes.

38:10.276 --> 38:12.067
He's also e-mailed me a driver's photo.

38:12.153 --> 38:14.394
- That was fast.
- They had the van number.

38:14.488 --> 38:15.733
Here, take a look.

38:16.991 --> 38:18.485
It's an alias. What's he do?

38:18.576 --> 38:20.367
Power line inspector.

38:30.087 --> 38:32.329
Is our node at the end
of that transmission line?

38:32.423 --> 38:34.297
Yes. About a mile west.

38:36.594 --> 38:38.136
Take that road.

38:44.935 --> 38:46.788
Didn't think you'd want to stop
to open the gate.

38:46.812 --> 38:49.434
Hell, no.
They don't have to blow the nodes.

38:49.523 --> 38:50.709
This guy knows where to take down

38:50.733 --> 38:52.502
three transmission towers
and do the same thing.

38:52.526 --> 38:54.086
How do we know this line
is one of them?

38:54.153 --> 38:55.612
It crosses the node, doesn't it?

38:55.696 --> 38:57.605
Two lines cross this node in and out.

38:57.698 --> 38:59.572
That's four places
within a mile of the node

38:59.658 --> 39:00.858
that he can blow a tower down.

39:00.951 --> 39:02.280
Well, maybe we'll get lucky.

39:02.369 --> 39:04.113
Nobody's that lucky.

39:04.872 --> 39:06.117
We are.

39:12.796 --> 39:14.437
Well, he could be
a power company employee

39:14.465 --> 39:15.959
doing his job.

39:19.428 --> 39:21.171
No, I don't think so!

39:38.489 --> 39:39.687
Freeze!

39:55.214 --> 39:57.171
Phone's got detonators.

40:05.599 --> 40:08.600
Looks like the other two
must have the same setup.

40:08.894 --> 40:11.979
Looks like he's got all three phones set
to the same number.

40:12.064 --> 40:13.891
How many numbers did he dial?

40:13.983 --> 40:15.062
Six.

40:16.026 --> 40:18.564
One more and ba-da-bing, ba-da-boom.

40:19.238 --> 40:20.862
Lucky he wasn't phone-savvy.

40:20.948 --> 40:23.439
Savvy enough to wire three phones
to the same number.

40:23.534 --> 40:26.618
Yeah. What if he used speed dial?

40:35.129 --> 40:36.753
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

40:39.550 --> 40:42.883
The lights are back on tonight
at Community Centre courts

40:42.970 --> 40:47.347
since Navy Commander Brian Farrell,
founder of Urban Lights

40:47.433 --> 40:49.342
was cleared today of any connection

40:49.435 --> 40:53.100
to the drug war
which claimed his life last Sunday.

40:53.188 --> 40:56.392
A Community Centre spokesperson
issued an apology

40:56.483 --> 40:58.275
and announced
that a commemorative plaque

40:58.360 --> 41:00.934
will be dedicated
to the memory of "Seadog,"

41:01.030 --> 41:03.781
as Commander Farrell
was affectionately called

41:03.866 --> 41:07.780
by the young men
he strived to help have a better life.

41:08.078 --> 41:11.530
This is Diane Fontaine, WXEK News.

41:11.874 --> 41:13.498
Now back to you.

41:15.878 --> 41:18.583
Doug, I need some "B" roll on the boys.

41:25.095 --> 41:26.590
How was that?

41:27.598 --> 41:28.926
Very nice.

41:29.433 --> 41:31.758
I can't guarantee
that my producer will air it.

41:31.852 --> 41:34.058
You're trying. That's a start.

41:39.276 --> 41:40.936
Thank you, Diane.

41:42.571 --> 41:44.813
You're welcome, Jethro.
