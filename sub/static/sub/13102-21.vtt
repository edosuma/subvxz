00:01.667 --> 00:03.708
[instrumental music]

00:04.833 --> 00:08.292
So, you couldn't sleep
either.

00:10.167 --> 00:11.708
Not really.

00:11.792 --> 00:14.125
I hear Delenn came back
from Minbar last night.

00:14.208 --> 00:15.500
Yes.

00:15.583 --> 00:17.333
The new headquarters for the
Alliance

00:17.417 --> 00:19.958
are just about finished.

00:20.042 --> 00:21.750
We can go any time.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.250
Hard to believe
it's been almost a year

00:26.333 --> 00:28.292
since you got here.

00:28.375 --> 00:30.458
Where does the time go?

00:33.875 --> 00:35.125
That way.

00:36.667 --> 00:38.833
And what's out there?

00:38.917 --> 00:40.333
The Rim.

00:41.917 --> 00:43.083
And beyond that?

00:44.375 --> 00:45.708
The truth.

00:51.333 --> 00:54.792
When we leave for Minbar..

00:54.875 --> 00:58.750
...I don't want any ceremonies,
brass bands, or speeches.

01:01.250 --> 01:03.667
I just wanna leave here
quietly.

01:05.292 --> 01:06.792
I understand.

01:08.958 --> 01:11.750
Before that, I..

01:11.833 --> 01:14.583
I wanted to thank you
for bringing me in here.

01:15.958 --> 01:17.333
The first few days,
I wasn't sure

01:17.417 --> 01:20.167
I really wanted
the job but..

01:20.250 --> 01:23.375
...this place
kinda grows on you.

01:26.833 --> 01:28.500
Yes, it does.

01:31.250 --> 01:34.250
And it's gonna be
hard to leave.

01:35.333 --> 01:36.542
I thought
I was prepared for it

01:36.625 --> 01:39.333
but now that the reality
of it is here.

01:42.708 --> 01:46.250
Well, it's just hard,
that's all.

01:50.208 --> 01:53.500
Well, I should, uh,
probably get some breakfast.

01:53.583 --> 01:55.083
We go online
in about an hour

01:55.167 --> 01:56.917
and we've got double the usual
number of ships coming in.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.042
Hmm.

01:58.125 --> 02:00.792
Looks like it's gonna be
one of those days.

02:02.583 --> 02:03.667
Mr. President.

02:03.750 --> 02:04.875
Captain..

02:07.125 --> 02:08.542
You're welcome.

02:09.833 --> 02:12.500
And in case I don't get
to say this later..

02:14.875 --> 02:16.750
...it's been good
having you here.

02:19.125 --> 02:22.083
Knowing that this place
is in good hands

02:22.167 --> 02:24.250
makes the leaving easier.

02:39.667 --> 02:41.708
[bell chiming]

02:46.417 --> 02:48.125
He's not there.

02:51.208 --> 02:55.000
Ah, well then, do you know
when G'Kar will return?

02:56.458 --> 02:59.625
He's not coming back.
He left a few days ago.

02:59.708 --> 03:01.458
Do you know
where he went?

03:01.542 --> 03:03.167
No. No one does.

03:03.250 --> 03:05.167
I think he wanted
it that way.

03:06.167 --> 03:07.917
But he sent for me on Narn.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.292
Said I should come
as quickly as possible.

03:11.375 --> 03:13.458
Did he leave any
message for me?

03:13.542 --> 03:17.042
No. No, not
that I know of.

03:17.125 --> 03:18.875
I'm sorry.

03:20.708 --> 03:23.792
[instrumental music]

03:26.500 --> 03:28.083
[chiming]

03:37.875 --> 03:39.083

03:39.167 --> 03:42.167
[automated message]
'Voice identification. Ta'Lon.'

03:42.250 --> 03:45.083
'Message waiting
from Ambassador G'Kar.'

03:45.167 --> 03:46.625
'Do you wish to receive?'

03:46.708 --> 03:48.625
Yes. Yes, of course.

03:48.708 --> 03:51.167
Greetings, Ta'Lon.

03:51.250 --> 03:52.958
I am leaving
this message for you

03:53.042 --> 03:57.083
because it appears
I must leave Babylon 5

03:57.167 --> 03:59.458
sooner than I had intended.

03:59.542 --> 04:02.667
I would have preferred
to say this in person

04:02.750 --> 04:06.792
but since I cannot,
let me say it here.

04:08.417 --> 04:11.167
Now that I am gone..

04:11.250 --> 04:14.292
...someone else must speak
for our people.

04:15.625 --> 04:19.792
I would like for
that person to be you.

04:24.417 --> 04:26.208
(Kosh)
And so it begins..

04:26.292 --> 04:28.625
(male #1)
There was a hole in your mind--

04:28.708 --> 04:32.875
(G'Kar)
No one here is
exactly what he appears.

04:32.958 --> 04:35.083
(Hague)
Commander Sinclair
is being reassigned.

04:35.167 --> 04:37.250
(Londo)
Why don't you eliminate
the entire Narn homeworld?

04:37.333 --> 04:41.375
(Elric)
I see a great hand
reaching out of the stars.

04:41.458 --> 04:43.917
(female #1)
President Clark has signed
a decree today declaring--

04:44.000 --> 04:46.583
(Sheridan)
These orders have forced us
to declare independence.

04:46.667 --> 04:49.083
Unless your people get off
their encounter suited butts

04:49.167 --> 04:50.833
and do something..

04:50.917 --> 04:53.708
(Kosh)
If you go to Z'ha'dum,
you will die.

04:53.792 --> 04:55.208
(Lorien)
Why are you here?

04:55.292 --> 04:57.083
Do you have anything
worth living for?

04:57.167 --> 04:58.667
(Delenn)
I think of my beautiful city
in flames.

04:58.750 --> 05:00.375
(Sheridan)
Giants in the playground..

05:00.458 --> 05:02.042
Now, get the hell
out of our galaxy!

05:02.125 --> 05:06.000
We are here to place
President Clark under arrest.

05:06.083 --> 05:09.125
[theme music]

05:39.125 --> 05:42.167
[music continues]

05:53.958 --> 05:55.542
Knowing you as I do, Ta'Lon

05:55.625 --> 05:58.000
I'm sure you're
wondering, why you?

05:58.083 --> 06:00.250
To say the least.

06:00.333 --> 06:02.750
(G'Kar)
'Why should you be asked
to take on the responsibility'

06:02.833 --> 06:06.083
of speaking for our people?

06:06.167 --> 06:09.042
Why you might accept it
is for you to decide.

06:09.125 --> 06:12.125
I can only tell you
why I've offered it.

06:15.042 --> 06:18.375
I believe there is a time
for enlightenment

06:18.458 --> 06:23.042
and a time for things
to get done.

06:23.125 --> 06:27.125
I have become a distraction
for our people.

06:27.208 --> 06:32.167
They require patience,
direction, determination

06:32.250 --> 06:34.625
and strength.

06:34.708 --> 06:38.625
I have provided a little
of the first two.

06:38.708 --> 06:41.792
(G'Kar)
'Now, you must provide
the rest.'

06:41.875 --> 06:45.417
'You have always been sensible
and level-headed.'

06:45.500 --> 06:48.292
A rock that will
never shift or break

06:48.375 --> 06:50.917
beneath the demands
of our people.

06:52.958 --> 06:55.458
And you have been my friend.

06:57.458 --> 07:00.625
In my absence, we will
need someone to focus

07:00.708 --> 07:02.625
on helping our world rebuild

07:02.708 --> 07:05.875
and strengthening ties
with the Alliance.

07:08.000 --> 07:12.292
In order to serve our people
here and at home

07:12.375 --> 07:17.042
one must be both priest
and warrior in equal measure.

07:18.458 --> 07:24.000
In recent months, I have become
more priest than warrior.

07:24.083 --> 07:25.833
Perhaps, now it is time
for someone

07:25.917 --> 07:28.500
who is more warrior
than priest.

07:29.708 --> 07:32.958
You may believe
you are not ready..

07:33.042 --> 07:37.958
...but you are as ready as I was
when I first came to Babylon 5.

07:39.292 --> 07:42.500
Check the records,
I think you'll be amused.

07:44.042 --> 07:45.458
When this message has finished.

07:45.542 --> 07:49.375
a copy will automatically be
sent to Sheridan and the others.

07:49.458 --> 07:52.917
They will receive you
as they would receive me.

07:54.125 --> 07:56.333
(G'Kar)
'Good luck, Ta'Lon.'

07:57.125 --> 08:00.000
Serve our people..

08:01.125 --> 08:02.917
...reasonably..

08:04.125 --> 08:08.958
...fairly and with...honor.

08:10.458 --> 08:12.875
The rest will attend to itself.

08:14.333 --> 08:17.625
So, I've decided that
you will be my replacement

08:17.708 --> 08:19.250
here on Babylon 5.

08:20.875 --> 08:22.667
Are you sure you
want me for this job?

08:22.750 --> 08:26.417
There are other doctors here
just as qualified as I am.

08:26.500 --> 08:28.000
Oh, absolutely.

08:28.083 --> 08:30.083
There's Dr. Hernandez
in Medlab 3

08:30.167 --> 08:31.458
who has more off world
experience

08:31.542 --> 08:32.958
with alien life forms.

08:33.042 --> 08:35.250
There's Dr. Fuhara
in, uh, Medlab 5

08:35.333 --> 08:38.250
who has more experience
in, uh, alien biologies

08:38.333 --> 08:39.917
than both of us put together.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.333
I think you're making
my point for me.

08:41.417 --> 08:42.708
I've been bouncing around

08:42.792 --> 08:44.792
from one medlab to the other
for three years.

08:44.875 --> 08:45.917
Exactly.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.083
The others are specialists.

08:48.167 --> 08:49.750
If you wanna be chief of staff
in a place like this

08:49.833 --> 08:52.208
you have to be a generalist.

08:52.292 --> 08:53.917
And I need someone
who is willing to fight

08:54.000 --> 08:55.792
for what she believes in.

08:55.875 --> 08:57.917
And you fit that bill.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.250
Alright.
Thank you.

09:00.333 --> 09:02.792
I'll, uh, try
to live up to the honor.

09:02.875 --> 09:04.875
So, when do you
leave for Earth?

09:04.958 --> 09:06.292
Tonight.

09:06.375 --> 09:08.375
The staff has been briefed,
they're ready for you.

09:08.458 --> 09:09.875
The Xenobiology division
back home

09:09.958 --> 09:11.167
needs me as soon as possible.

09:11.250 --> 09:13.458
Well, what about Delenn?
Her pregnancy is--

09:13.542 --> 09:15.542
I've done everything
I can on my end.

09:15.625 --> 09:18.083
Her own doctors back home will
take over when she gets there.

09:18.167 --> 09:19.583
So, I thought
I might as well do it

09:19.667 --> 09:22.375
in one short sharp shot
and get it over with.

09:22.458 --> 09:24.292
I assume you're at least
going to say goodbye

09:24.375 --> 09:26.833
to President Sheridan
before you leave?

09:28.208 --> 09:30.542
Yep.
He's next on my list.

09:33.042 --> 09:34.458
Good luck, doctor.

09:34.542 --> 09:36.042
You have any questions,
you know where to find me.

09:36.125 --> 09:39.208
[instrumental music]

10:01.792 --> 10:02.833
Yes?

10:04.750 --> 10:07.000
- Hello, Delenn.
- Lennier.

10:07.083 --> 10:08.833
You didn't tell me
you were coming.

10:08.917 --> 10:12.708
It would've been considerably
less of a surprise if I had.

10:12.792 --> 10:14.542
But w-w-what are you
doing here?

10:14.625 --> 10:16.167
Your training to be Anla-Shok

10:16.250 --> 10:18.333
must be at its most
critical stage right now.

10:18.417 --> 10:22.500
There was a break in training
for personal time.

10:22.583 --> 10:24.250
And I decided
to take mine here

10:24.333 --> 10:27.333
to help you move back home
and ensure your safe arrival.

10:27.417 --> 10:30.542
I believe the humans
call it a working holiday.

10:30.625 --> 10:33.333
Well, I'm happy that you came.

10:33.417 --> 10:35.542
John and I have been
packing all day.

10:35.625 --> 10:37.542
I could use an excuse
to sit and talk to someone

10:37.625 --> 10:39.000
for a few minutes.

10:39.083 --> 10:40.458
Tell me of home.

10:40.542 --> 10:42.042
'I'll make something
hot to drink.'

10:42.125 --> 10:44.708
Oh, don't, don't bother
on my account.

10:44.792 --> 10:46.750
No, no, no.
It's no trouble at all.

10:46.833 --> 10:49.083
(Delenn)
'Just let me..'

10:49.167 --> 10:51.917
'...let me find
my fili leaves.'

10:52.000 --> 10:54.167
And according to the reports,
we've had one minor skirmish

10:54.250 --> 10:57.208
between Drazi and Brakiri forces
along their border.

10:57.292 --> 10:58.875
But other than that,
it's pretty quiet out there.

10:58.958 --> 11:01.292
What kind of
border skirmish?

11:01.375 --> 11:02.667
I'm still going
through the analysis

11:02.750 --> 11:05.333
but it looks like
a squabble broke out

11:05.417 --> 11:07.417
over a visit to
a brothel on Vermini 7.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.083
[laughs]

11:09.167 --> 11:10.625
Apparently, some
of the Brakiri pilots

11:10.708 --> 11:13.625
in the area have been
using it as a layover.

11:13.708 --> 11:15.500
'And the Drazi pilots
don't like it'

11:15.583 --> 11:17.917
because the employees
are primarily Drazi.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.208
See, there's
some sort of taboo

11:19.292 --> 11:21.083
about touching Brakiri and--

11:21.167 --> 11:22.917
I think that's
as much information

11:23.000 --> 11:26.417
as I can handle, Tessa.
Anything else?

11:26.500 --> 11:29.792
No, Mr. President, as I said,
it's pretty quiet out there.

11:29.875 --> 11:32.917
So you can head out
at your discretion, no problem.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.250
Good. Thank you.

11:37.833 --> 11:40.000
Well, I think
she's very thorough.

11:40.083 --> 11:42.167
She's working out just fine
as head of intelligence.

11:42.250 --> 11:43.958
I agree.

11:44.042 --> 11:45.833
Any reason why
she's not going to Minbar

11:45.917 --> 11:46.917
with you and Delenn?

11:47.000 --> 11:48.125
I would've thought you wanted

11:48.208 --> 11:49.750
your cabinet there
alongside you.

11:49.833 --> 11:51.292
I thought about it

11:51.375 --> 11:54.417
but Babylon 5 is a hot point
for information.

11:54.500 --> 11:55.958
She'd have fewer
resources on Minbar

11:56.042 --> 11:58.583
so it's best she stays here.

11:58.667 --> 12:00.833
Garibaldi finally realized
that he couldn't do his job

12:00.917 --> 12:02.458
living with Lise on Mars.

12:02.542 --> 12:06.500
Speaking of which, has anybody
heard from Garibaldi lately?

12:06.583 --> 12:10.375
No, but I'm sure
he's keeping very busy.

12:20.208 --> 12:22.083
Sorry to keep you waiting.

12:22.167 --> 12:23.833
Please be seated.

12:30.167 --> 12:31.458
Since I'm the new guy
on the block.

12:31.542 --> 12:33.667
I figured I should
introduce myself.

12:33.750 --> 12:35.167
The name is Garibaldi.

12:35.250 --> 12:36.667
Michael Garibaldi.

12:36.750 --> 12:38.000
And at the suggestion
of my wife Lise

12:38.083 --> 12:39.500
I have decided to take over

12:39.583 --> 12:41.958
the day to day operations
of Edgars Industries.

12:42.042 --> 12:44.500
So why did you wanna see us?

12:44.583 --> 12:47.833
Because I asked for a list
of company troublemakers.

12:47.917 --> 12:49.375
Now, all of you have been stuck

12:49.458 --> 12:51.250
in the same mid level position
in the same department

12:51.333 --> 12:52.958
because you have
an attitude problem.

12:53.042 --> 12:55.250
If you don't like something
you complain, you talk back.

12:55.333 --> 12:57.292
You think you can do everything
better than your bosses--

12:57.375 --> 12:59.792
So, we're fired, is that it?

12:59.875 --> 13:02.708
Actually, more like promoted.

13:02.792 --> 13:04.250
I've decided that
all of you are now

13:04.333 --> 13:07.292
on the board of directors
of Edgars Industries.

13:07.375 --> 13:09.125
Your job is to tell me
where we've screwed up.

13:09.208 --> 13:11.708
So that we can fix it,
make it better.

13:11.792 --> 13:14.417
The position entitles you
to a 100% salary increase

13:14.500 --> 13:17.000
effective immediately
plus benefits.

13:17.083 --> 13:18.917
One part of your job
is to tell me

13:19.000 --> 13:22.042
if I've screwed up,
to stand your ground.

13:22.125 --> 13:25.083
Now, if you're right,
you get a bonus.

13:25.167 --> 13:29.333
If you're wrong,
I will eat you for lunch.

13:29.417 --> 13:31.208
Does anyone have
a problem with that?

14:00.750 --> 14:03.417
It's rumored that
President Sheridan and Delenn

14:03.500 --> 14:05.125
will be leaving
aboard that ship

14:05.208 --> 14:07.917

ISA Headquarters

departure is classified'

14:12.667 --> 14:13.833

Off.

14:15.500 --> 14:17.000
Damn reporters.

14:17.083 --> 14:19.375
They are always two steps ahead
of where they're supposed to be.

14:19.458 --> 14:21.250
How are we supposed
to leave quietly

14:21.333 --> 14:23.625
with all this going on?

14:23.708 --> 14:25.208
Yes?

14:31.500 --> 14:34.083
Your belongings have been
transferred to our ship.

14:34.167 --> 14:36.333
It only awaits
your arrival.

14:36.417 --> 14:37.958
Um, I'm going to take

14:38.042 --> 14:39.125
one last look in
the other room

14:39.208 --> 14:40.708
make sure I didn't
forget anything.

14:40.792 --> 14:42.125
Hmm.

14:46.500 --> 14:48.958
I, uh, I wanna
thank you for coming

14:49.042 --> 14:50.750
all the way out here, Lennier.

14:50.833 --> 14:52.708
It means a lot to her.

14:52.792 --> 14:54.500
To both of us.

14:54.583 --> 14:56.583
I could not have done
otherwise.

14:59.125 --> 15:01.958
So, uh, are you
going to stay long on Minbar

15:02.042 --> 15:03.542
once we've moved in?

15:03.625 --> 15:05.625
Not long. My training
is almost complete.

15:05.708 --> 15:07.833
I should return to it
as soon as possible.

15:07.917 --> 15:10.375
Ah, of course,
of course.

15:10.458 --> 15:12.750
Uh, just so you understand,
you're always welcome

15:12.833 --> 15:14.750
to stay with us
when you're back home.

15:14.833 --> 15:18.083
It'd be nice to, you know,
see a familiar face

15:18.167 --> 15:20.000
from time to time.

15:20.083 --> 15:22.542
I...will remember that.

15:22.625 --> 15:24.208
Hmm.

15:25.042 --> 15:26.458
Find anything?

15:26.542 --> 15:29.000
No. It looks as if
we've got it all.

15:32.667 --> 15:34.292
I guess it's time.

15:40.875 --> 15:43.917
[mellow music]

15:50.417 --> 15:52.542
ISN broke your travel plans

a few words.

Uh...ahem.

16:15.375 --> 16:16.792
Delenn.

16:26.292 --> 16:30.000
When I was first assigned
to Babylon 5

16:30.083 --> 16:32.500
I had to learn to speak
several languages.

16:32.583 --> 16:34.792
Drazi, Brakiri, Centauri

16:34.875 --> 16:39.208
and, of course, English,
the human language of commerce.

16:39.292 --> 16:44.667
Some words have always come
easier to me than the others.

16:44.750 --> 16:50.000
One of the most difficult words
for me was "goodbye."

16:50.083 --> 16:54.167
There is no corresponding word
for "goodbye" in Minbari.

16:54.250 --> 16:56.167
All our partings
contain within them

16:56.250 --> 16:58.750
the possibility
of meeting again

16:58.833 --> 17:04.042
'in other places, in other
times, in other lives.'

17:06.042 --> 17:09.833
So, you will excuse me
if I do not say goodbye.

17:11.167 --> 17:14.625
Our souls are a part
of this place..

17:14.708 --> 17:18.875

of our future..

17:55.708 --> 17:58.083
Well, I was wondering if I were
gonna see you before we left.

17:58.167 --> 18:00.750
Ah, I got tied up. Some problems
down in brown sector.

18:00.833 --> 18:04.792
You know, same old, same old,
but I didn't wanna miss this.

18:04.875 --> 18:06.708
Well, it's good to know
at least one of the old gang

18:06.792 --> 18:08.167
will be stickin' around
for a while.

18:08.250 --> 18:10.708
Who, me? Ha-ha.
Absolutely.

18:10.792 --> 18:12.167
Hell, I'll probably
still be here

18:12.250 --> 18:13.458
when they turn off the lights.

18:13.542 --> 18:15.792

I don't doubt it.

18:15.875 --> 18:17.292

[music continues]

18:48.667 --> 18:50.375
Where's the captain?

18:50.458 --> 18:53.542
He was instructed
to remain on Babylon 5.

18:53.625 --> 18:55.208
I felt it would be
more symbolic

18:55.292 --> 18:58.208
if the two of you commanded
the ship for our trip home.

18:59.542 --> 19:01.708
Well, that's very
good thinking, Lennier.

19:10.125 --> 19:12.708
Stand by to bring her about.

with that?

20:42.417 --> 20:44.625
No, no.
I'm almost done.

20:44.708 --> 20:46.000
Ah.

20:51.083 --> 20:53.083
Maybe you should
go for a walk.

20:54.583 --> 20:56.042
I don't have
to go for a walk.

20:56.125 --> 20:57.583
I-I am fine.

20:58.917 --> 21:00.042
As you wish.

'What happened?'

23:51.042 --> 23:52.875
I had his quarters searched

23:52.958 --> 23:55.583
at the Anla-Shok training
facilities in Tuzanor.

23:55.667 --> 23:57.583
They found his diary.

23:57.667 --> 24:00.500
I knew that he had certain
feelings towards me

24:00.583 --> 24:02.333
but I had no idea.

24:03.333 --> 24:04.500
His entries make it clear

24:04.583 --> 24:08.083
that he considers
our union a mistake.

24:08.167 --> 24:10.167
But there is no indication

24:10.250 --> 24:12.250
that he meant you any harm.

24:14.042 --> 24:15.500
Then what happened?

24:18.250 --> 24:22.542
There are moments when
we all become someone else.

24:22.625 --> 24:25.083
Something other
than what we are.

24:25.167 --> 24:26.958
It takes only a moment

24:27.042 --> 24:29.167
but we spend the
rest of our lives

24:29.250 --> 24:32.583
looking back at that
moment in shame.

24:32.667 --> 24:35.583
For one instant, out of
a lifetime of service

24:35.667 --> 24:38.958
he became all of his own
worst instincts.

24:40.250 --> 24:43.417
I can't even imagine
what he's feeling right now.

24:45.625 --> 24:49.542
He was on his way
back when I arrived.

24:49.625 --> 24:51.917
Perhaps he was having
a change of heart.

24:52.000 --> 24:55.500
Or perhaps he wanted
to make sure I was dead.

24:57.958 --> 24:59.667
There's no way to know.

25:01.833 --> 25:03.000
Will you tell me
one thing, John?

25:03.083 --> 25:04.250
Hmm.

25:04.333 --> 25:06.750
If he said he was coming back

25:06.833 --> 25:08.917
because he had changed
his mind, because he wanted

25:09.000 --> 25:12.125
to undo what he had done,
would you believe him?

25:13.083 --> 25:14.250
I don't know.

25:14.333 --> 25:16.708
I-I think I would
believe him, but..

25:16.792 --> 25:19.958
...I shouldn't,
but I think I would.

25:20.042 --> 25:23.083
It's like I said, there's
no way to know the truth.

25:23.167 --> 25:28.250
And even if he changed his mind,
he still crossed the line.

25:28.333 --> 25:30.083
There has to be a price.

25:30.167 --> 25:32.292
I know..

25:32.375 --> 25:34.458
...and I'm sure
he does as well.

25:34.542 --> 25:35.708
[coughs]

25:35.792 --> 25:37.417
You, you should stay
in bed.

25:37.500 --> 25:39.292
I'll tell the crew
to delay our arrival

25:39.375 --> 25:40.625
for another day or so.

25:40.708 --> 25:42.917
No, no, they will
be expecting us

25:43.000 --> 25:45.833
and I'm not about to start
the first day on the job

25:45.917 --> 25:47.917
by arriving late.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
No. You know how
rumors get around.

25:50.083 --> 25:52.292
If we're even an hour late,
they'll be worried

25:52.375 --> 25:54.958
that we were all
killed or something.

25:55.042 --> 25:59.667
No. We'll tell them that
I've got a cold, that's all.

25:59.750 --> 26:01.208
But Lennier..

26:01.292 --> 26:03.000
What happened with Lennier..

26:04.000 --> 26:06.208
...will remain on this ship.

26:07.875 --> 26:09.708
You would do this for him?

26:12.750 --> 26:15.750
Um, telling everyone that
I was damn near killed

26:15.833 --> 26:17.917
by one of your people
isn't exactly my idea

26:18.000 --> 26:21.208
of starting off
on the right foot.

26:21.292 --> 26:24.292
No, we will, we will put
our best face on this.

26:24.375 --> 26:29.375
We will go in with,
with smiles and confidence..

26:31.167 --> 26:33.667
...and that will give him..

26:33.750 --> 26:35.542
...room enough to breathe..

26:35.625 --> 26:37.417
...until we can talk to him.

who are pleased
to see you in office.

28:13.167 --> 28:16.417
It's the people who are furious
that you're even alive.

28:16.500 --> 28:18.917
No less holding
a position of power.

28:19.000 --> 28:22.625
Knowing that every day
you succeed, they die

28:22.708 --> 28:25.583
a little more inside,
makes the endeavor

28:25.667 --> 28:28.417
eminently satisfying. Hmm?

28:28.500 --> 28:32.125
If you don't mind my saying so,
Emperor Mollari

28:32.208 --> 28:34.792
your attitude towards us
is quite improved..

28:34.875 --> 28:36.250
...over the last time.

28:36.333 --> 28:37.917
When we were all
on Centauri Prime

28:38.000 --> 28:41.875
you said some...unkind things.

28:41.958 --> 28:45.083
Playing to the audience,
Delenn, nothing more.

28:45.167 --> 28:48.167
I need to get my people
fired up for the long

28:48.250 --> 28:51.292
and difficult process
of rebuilding.

28:51.375 --> 28:54.583
There's politics
and there's friendship.

returning here to stay'

how could I not come and convey
my personal good wishes?

29:07.542 --> 29:08.792
I would raise a toast to you

29:08.875 --> 29:12.625
but there doesn't seem
to be anything at hand.

29:12.708 --> 29:15.583
Mr. President, do you
have a little brivari?

29:15.667 --> 29:18.625
Or perhaps some of that
excellent Earth whiskey

tucked away in a box
somewhere, yes?

29:20.625 --> 29:22.000
(Sheridan)
'No.'

29:22.083 --> 29:25.458
Uh, since alcohol is dangerous
for the Minbari, I..

29:25.542 --> 29:28.167
I left all that stuff
back on Babylon 5.

29:28.250 --> 29:30.958
But surely
there must be a little.

29:31.042 --> 29:32.500
Not a drop.

29:32.583 --> 29:35.417
I'm surprised you didn't
bring along your own supplies.

29:35.500 --> 29:38.042
Well, my...associates

29:38.125 --> 29:41.208
don't allow me
such pleasures anymore.

29:41.292 --> 29:45.000
I suppose they feel that
I am dangerous enough sober.

29:45.083 --> 29:48.708
(Londo)
'No reason to,
to make things worse.'

30:05.958 --> 30:09.417
So, Delenn.
Delenn?

30:09.500 --> 30:11.208
What.. I'm sorry.

30:11.292 --> 30:13.208
What were you saying, Londo?

30:13.292 --> 30:15.625
You haven't asked me
about my gift.

30:17.208 --> 30:18.417
What gift?

30:22.042 --> 30:25.000
I brought this
for your child.

30:27.792 --> 30:30.208
It is a Centauri tradition..

30:30.292 --> 30:33.625
...to give this to
the heir to the throne

30:33.708 --> 30:36.083
when he or she
comes of age.

30:36.167 --> 30:37.875
'It's very old.'

30:37.958 --> 30:41.333
(Delenn)
Well, uh,
it's beautiful, but, uh

30:41.417 --> 30:43.167
we can't possibly accept. We--

30:43.250 --> 30:44.708
(Londo)
I insist.

30:44.792 --> 30:46.750
Besides, I have no heirs.

30:46.833 --> 30:50.250
When I am gone, I suspect the
Centaurum will do all they can

30:50.333 --> 30:53.250
to eliminate
the position of emperor.

30:54.167 --> 30:55.417
If I am going to be obsolete

30:55.500 --> 30:58.583
and that is going
to be obsolete

30:58.667 --> 31:01.000
then I should do
all that I can

31:01.083 --> 31:04.083
to make sure it ends up
where it will be appreciated.

31:04.167 --> 31:05.917
[whispering]

31:07.000 --> 31:08.917
Something has just come up.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.875
If you will excuse me.

31:15.042 --> 31:18.792
Well, uh, since I can't
talk you out of this, uh..

31:18.875 --> 31:20.583
...thank you.

31:20.667 --> 31:22.000
Uh, when do I, uh--

31:22.083 --> 31:27.208
When your child, male
or female, turns 16 years

31:27.292 --> 31:29.042
then you hand it over.

31:30.208 --> 31:33.958
Look at this. I noticed
the bottom is sealed.

31:34.042 --> 31:35.083
Yes.

31:36.542 --> 31:39.792
I am told that it contains
water taken from the river

31:39.875 --> 31:43.292
that flowed past
the very first palace

31:43.375 --> 31:45.542
two thousand years ago.

31:55.250 --> 31:56.292
Hello, Delenn.

31:56.375 --> 31:58.083
Lennier. Where are--

31:58.167 --> 32:00.250
I'm afraid I cannot talk long.

32:00.333 --> 32:01.375
And there is no use
in attempting

32:01.458 --> 32:02.667
to trace this signal.

32:02.750 --> 32:04.333
My Anla-Shok training
has taught me

32:04.417 --> 32:06.125
how to avoid such things.

32:07.750 --> 32:09.792
Lennier.
Listen to me.

32:09.875 --> 32:11.042
You need to come back.

32:11.125 --> 32:12.333
- We can--
- No.

32:12.417 --> 32:14.333
There is nothing to be done.

32:14.417 --> 32:16.708
I've already done enough damage.

32:17.833 --> 32:20.292
I only wanted to call
to tell you..

32:21.583 --> 32:24.167
...that I'm so sorry
for what happened.

32:24.250 --> 32:26.500
meant him any harm.

32:26.583 --> 32:28.500
I never intended
for this to happen.

32:28.583 --> 32:31.125
It, it just happened.

32:32.417 --> 32:35.958
And I, I cannot even
ask you to forgive me

32:36.042 --> 32:38.833
because I know
I will never forgive myself.

32:40.417 --> 32:42.917
I only wanted to call
to tell you..

32:43.000 --> 32:45.083
...one last time..

32:45.167 --> 32:46.750
...that I'm so sorry..

32:47.583 --> 32:50.042
...and that I'm going away.

32:50.125 --> 32:52.625
I must consider
what I've done..

32:52.708 --> 32:56.250
...decide who and what I am.

32:56.333 --> 33:00.125
I need to be somewhere else
until I can find a way

33:00.208 --> 33:02.500
to redeem myself
in your eyes..

33:03.750 --> 33:05.875
'...however long that may take.'

33:05.958 --> 33:06.958
Lennier..

33:07.042 --> 33:09.167
When you see..

33:09.250 --> 33:10.708
...your husband..

33:10.792 --> 33:13.750
...please tell him,
tell him that..

33:14.833 --> 33:16.792
...I'm sorry.

33:16.875 --> 33:20.542
I would tell him myself
but...I'm too ashamed.

33:20.625 --> 33:22.250
Don't do this, Lennier.

33:22.333 --> 33:24.750
I cannot imagine a life
without you in it.

33:24.833 --> 33:26.875
That is unnecessary.

33:26.958 --> 33:30.167
While I am no longer sure
of a great many things

33:30.250 --> 33:34.417
there is one thing I do know
with absolute certainty..

33:34.500 --> 33:37.417
...we will meet again, Delenn.

33:37.500 --> 33:42.417
And on that day,
though I know I will..

33:42.500 --> 33:44.250
...never earn your love.

33:45.417 --> 33:47.542
I will earn your forgiveness.

33:49.167 --> 33:53.625
Until then, if you would,
honor my memory..

33:54.917 --> 33:56.833
...and be happy.

33:56.917 --> 33:58.750
For my sake..

33:58.833 --> 34:00.167
...and for his.

34:08.125 --> 34:10.458
Are you sure you can't stay
a little longer?

34:10.542 --> 34:12.792
No, the affairs of state
weigh heavily on me

34:12.875 --> 34:14.500
just as they do on you.

34:14.583 --> 34:16.417
Besides, I would think

34:16.500 --> 34:18.000
that you would want
to settle in

34:18.083 --> 34:19.750
and get down to creating

34:19.833 --> 34:23.208
the greatest empire
in history, yes?

34:23.292 --> 34:25.708
[chuckles]

34:25.792 --> 34:29.333
One thing I do want you
to know..

34:29.417 --> 34:33.167
...to hold in your thoughts
in the years to come.

34:35.083 --> 34:37.083
I want you to know..

34:38.292 --> 34:41.500
...that you are my friends..

34:41.583 --> 34:43.417
'...that you'll always
be my friends'

34:43.500 --> 34:46.167
'no matter what happens.'

34:48.583 --> 34:53.042
And I...I want you to know
that this day..

34:54.417 --> 34:56.500
...this day, with you..

34:57.500 --> 34:59.708
...means more to me than..

35:00.875 --> 35:02.958
...you will ever know.

35:06.750 --> 35:09.167
It appears I must go now.

35:09.250 --> 35:10.458
I know.

35:12.333 --> 35:15.000
Well, you're always welcome
to come back, Londo.

35:15.083 --> 35:16.917
Thank you.

35:17.000 --> 35:18.417
Goodbye.

35:28.458 --> 35:30.083
I..

35:31.750 --> 35:34.917
Was that Lennier
who called earlier?

35:35.000 --> 35:36.292
Yes.

35:36.375 --> 35:37.958
What did he say?

35:39.167 --> 35:40.750
It's a long story.

35:40.833 --> 35:42.958
I'll tell you
when we're alone.

35:44.083 --> 35:45.708
Are you okay?

35:47.292 --> 35:51.417
For the first time,
I think I will be alright.

35:57.833 --> 36:00.917
[instrumental music]

36:07.500 --> 36:10.083
(Drakh)
'You have done well.'

36:10.167 --> 36:14.625
'As a reward, you may now have
one hour free from us.'

36:14.708 --> 36:17.625
[footsteps approaching]

36:28.208 --> 36:29.625
Now what?

36:29.708 --> 36:33.250
(Drakh)
'Now we await
the passage of years.'

36:33.333 --> 36:34.375
Years?

36:34.458 --> 36:37.000
(Drakh)
'We are very patient.'

36:55.375 --> 36:58.417
[dramatic music]

37:07.042 --> 37:08.250
[sighs]

37:30.667 --> 37:31.958
Ah.

37:35.625 --> 37:36.958
Begin recording.

37:40.875 --> 37:44.917
Today is my first night
on Minbar.

37:45.708 --> 37:47.083
My..

37:48.792 --> 37:50.333
Our new home.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.208
Londo's visit
got me thinking

37:54.292 --> 37:57.667
about the day
my child comes of age.

37:57.750 --> 38:00.292
On earth, that's 21.

38:02.583 --> 38:05.250
If Lorien's prediction holds..

38:06.917 --> 38:09.250
...I only have 19 years left.

38:11.083 --> 38:13.333
I won't be there
to see you..

38:13.417 --> 38:15.208
...come into your own..

38:15.292 --> 38:18.333
...whoever you are,
whoever you will be.

38:20.292 --> 38:23.000
Not that either
of those things matter.

38:23.083 --> 38:26.167
Because sight unseen..

38:26.250 --> 38:31.917
...I know that I will love you
because you are my child..

38:32.000 --> 38:33.208
...and the child of the woman

38:33.292 --> 38:36.750
that I love
more than life itself.

38:39.208 --> 38:42.625
I will give you that love
as best I can..

38:43.583 --> 38:45.375
...for as long as I'm here.

38:47.792 --> 38:52.750
But a day like this,
your 21st birthday

38:53.833 --> 38:56.167
requires something more.

38:59.667 --> 39:02.708
So...I give you..

39:03.667 --> 39:05.583
...what little wisdom I have.

39:08.167 --> 39:12.500
'Delenn...is the greatest ally
you will ever have.'

39:13.792 --> 39:15.958
'Her depths of courage
and compassion'

39:16.042 --> 39:19.333
'are unmatched
in my experience.'

39:19.417 --> 39:23.292
'Look to her
for wisdom and fire'

39:23.375 --> 39:24.875
'in equal measure.'

39:26.000 --> 39:28.625
And if you ever have
any doubt..

39:29.417 --> 39:31.167
...talk to her.

39:31.250 --> 39:33.167
She will never judge you.

39:34.417 --> 39:36.500
She will only love you.

39:38.458 --> 39:42.458
From time to time,
you will make mistakes.

39:44.000 --> 39:46.708
(Sheridan)
They're inevitable.

39:46.792 --> 39:50.833
Sometimes those mistakes
will be...huge.

39:52.208 --> 39:54.875
What matters is
that you learn from them.

39:54.958 --> 39:58.333
There's nothing wrong
with falling down.

39:58.417 --> 40:01.625
So long as you end up
just two inches taller

40:01.708 --> 40:04.208
when you pick yourself up
off the floor.

40:05.875 --> 40:11.250
At times, you may end up
far away from home.

40:11.333 --> 40:14.375
(Sheridan)
You may not be sure
of where you belong anymore.

40:16.875 --> 40:19.458
But home is always there.

40:19.542 --> 40:23.625
Because home...is not a place.

40:25.583 --> 40:28.375
It's wherever
your passion takes you.

40:30.333 --> 40:32.792
As you continue on your path..

40:34.208 --> 40:38.667
...you will lose some friends
and gain new ones.

40:38.750 --> 40:41.000
(Sheridan)
The process is painful

40:41.083 --> 40:45.333
but...often necessary.

40:45.417 --> 40:48.458
They will change
and you will change

40:48.542 --> 40:51.625
because life is change.

40:54.042 --> 40:56.375
From time to time..

40:56.458 --> 40:59.583
...they must find their own way

40:59.667 --> 41:02.083
and that way
may not be yours.

41:03.917 --> 41:06.375
Enjoy them
for what they are.

41:06.458 --> 41:09.875
And remember them
for what they were.

41:11.000 --> 41:12.958
There's not much left.

41:14.125 --> 41:17.583
Except...I believe..

41:18.958 --> 41:21.417
I really do believe
that sooner or later

41:21.500 --> 41:23.458
no matter what happens..

41:24.375 --> 41:26.208
...things do work out.

41:27.500 --> 41:32.125
Oh, we have hard times.
We suffer.

41:32.208 --> 41:34.875
We lose loved ones.

41:34.958 --> 41:37.083
[smirks]
The road is never easy.

41:38.458 --> 41:40.875
It was never meant
to be easy.

41:42.542 --> 41:44.625
But in the long run..

41:44.708 --> 41:48.375
...if you stay true
to what you believe..

41:49.750 --> 41:51.833
...things do work out.

41:54.750 --> 41:58.417
Always...be willing to fight
for what you believe in.

41:58.500 --> 41:59.917
It doesn't matter
if a thousand people

42:00.000 --> 42:03.833
agree with you or one person
agrees with you.

42:03.917 --> 42:06.750
It doesn't matter
if you stand completely alone.

42:09.333 --> 42:12.250
Fight for what you believe.

42:14.667 --> 42:17.042
Which brings me to the..

42:17.125 --> 42:19.042
...first piece of advice
my dad ever gave me

42:19.125 --> 42:21.042
and now I'm giving it to you.

42:23.458 --> 42:24.500
Never--

42:24.583 --> 42:29.125
Never start a fight
but always finish it.

42:31.542 --> 42:33.625
finish it.

42:36.083 --> 42:37.208
[clicks button]

42:39.125 --> 42:40.750
I have a piece of advice
for you.

42:40.833 --> 42:43.833
- Hmm?
- Get some sleep.

42:45.708 --> 42:47.958
I think I'll do
just that.

42:48.042 --> 42:50.125
It's been a long day.

42:50.208 --> 42:52.125
I might even
sleep in tomorrow.

42:52.208 --> 42:53.958
Mm. Good idea.

42:54.042 --> 42:55.375
[chuckles]

42:56.583 --> 42:58.042
Mm.

43:02.583 --> 43:05.208
Have I told you today
how much I love you?

43:06.625 --> 43:08.625
Yes.

43:08.708 --> 43:10.625
But you may continue
to repeat it

43:10.708 --> 43:13.208
for as long as you like.

43:13.292 --> 43:16.125
Oh...I plan to.

43:18.167 --> 43:22.250
Every day...that I can.

43:23.458 --> 43:26.542
[instrumental music]

43:33.708 --> 43:36.083
[theme music]
