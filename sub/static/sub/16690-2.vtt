00:02.402 --> 00:04.237
Tonight on Kitchen Nightmares...

00:04.304 --> 00:07.040
Gordon Ramsay heads
to West Babylon, New York,

00:07.107 --> 00:08.475
to help two former waitresses...

00:08.542 --> 00:10.010
I can't do this tonight.

00:10.077 --> 00:12.312
Cry about
what we've become here.

00:12.379 --> 00:13.513
Who bought a restaurant

00:13.613 --> 00:14.915
called Classic American,

00:14.981 --> 00:18.185
hoping to achieve
the classic American dream.

00:18.217 --> 00:20.253
Fighting a losing battle
every day.

00:20.320 --> 00:22.288
But with almost
a million dollars in debt...

00:22.355 --> 00:25.792
I feel like I've failed.
What are we gonna do?

00:25.825 --> 00:27.527
These owners are in
for the fight of their life.

00:27.594 --> 00:30.000
Stop going in my  ear
and let me work.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.531
Stop going in my  ear
and let me work.

00:31.531 --> 00:33.066
The kitchen has no stock.

00:33.132 --> 00:34.367
We don't have mozzarella sticks.

00:34.434 --> 00:36.202
Teresa, no burgers.

00:36.269 --> 00:38.037
The dining room has no supplies.

00:38.104 --> 00:39.105
We have no cups,
no menus.

00:39.172 --> 00:40.139
And everyone...

00:40.206 --> 00:41.774
I got a  comment

00:41.841 --> 00:43.876
- about every  thing.
- Is on edge.

00:43.943 --> 00:45.778
Guys. Guys.
Back off.

00:45.845 --> 00:48.414
In one of the most emotional
Kitchen Nightmares ever...

00:48.481 --> 00:50.950
We lost our way.

00:51.017 --> 00:52.752
Chef Ramsay pulls out
all the stops.

00:52.819 --> 00:54.087
You cannot give up.

00:54.153 --> 00:55.455
But he may be forced to do

00:55.521 --> 00:56.489
the unthinkable.

00:56.556 --> 00:58.124
Close your business.

00:58.191 --> 01:00.000
Close it.
Close it.

01:00.000 --> 01:00.860
Close it.
Close it.

01:20.213 --> 01:21.748
West Babylon, New York--

01:21.814 --> 01:23.683
a close-knit suburban community

01:23.750 --> 01:25.218
located on Long Island,

01:25.285 --> 01:26.653
an hour away from Manhattan.

01:26.719 --> 01:29.055
Best friends Colleen and Naomi

01:29.122 --> 01:30.000
started as waitresses
at a small, quaint restaurant

01:30.000 --> 01:31.391
started as waitresses
at a small, quaint restaurant

01:31.491 --> 01:33.092
called Classic American.

01:33.159 --> 01:35.128
Then, in the year 2000,

01:35.228 --> 01:37.330
they seized an opportunity

01:37.397 --> 01:39.666
and bought the business
from their boss.

01:39.732 --> 01:40.800
What do you think?

01:40.867 --> 01:42.101
We ready to open
in a couple of minutes?

01:42.168 --> 01:43.736
Classic American
was like my home.

01:43.803 --> 01:44.804
I grew up here.

01:44.871 --> 01:46.606
I figured I knew everything

01:46.673 --> 01:47.774
there was to know
about the restaurant.

01:47.840 --> 01:48.808
Why not?

01:48.875 --> 01:50.209
Everything's good.

01:50.276 --> 01:51.477
Oh, thank you.

01:51.544 --> 01:53.012
We knew the business.

01:53.079 --> 01:54.414
We knew the customers.
And it was good.

01:54.480 --> 01:56.482
This would be the beginning
of something great.

01:56.549 --> 01:58.918
Soon after buying
the restaurant,

01:58.985 --> 02:00.000
Colleen made her son Kevin
the head chef...

02:00.000 --> 02:00.753
Colleen made her son Kevin
the head chef...

02:00.820 --> 02:01.988
Order.

02:02.055 --> 02:03.189
And her boyfriend, Dom,

02:03.256 --> 02:04.390
the unofficial manager.

02:04.457 --> 02:06.526
Give me two bags
of raw shrimp.

02:06.592 --> 02:07.727
Thanks.

02:07.794 --> 02:09.195
I started hooking up
with Colleen,

02:09.262 --> 02:10.863
and then she said,
"Well, I could use you

02:10.930 --> 02:13.733
at the restaurant."

02:13.800 --> 02:15.601
So she's using me.

02:17.036 --> 02:18.404
I enjoy my job
at Classic American,

02:18.471 --> 02:19.839
'cause it's
like a big family here.

02:19.906 --> 02:21.140
Big hugs, Kev.

02:21.207 --> 02:22.442
Whoa.

02:22.508 --> 02:23.676
It was good in the beginning.

02:23.743 --> 02:25.978
First couple years,
the place was packed.

02:26.045 --> 02:27.980
You didn't have to worry
or wonder

02:28.047 --> 02:29.582
if you were gonna be busy.

02:29.649 --> 02:30.000
Now you get
maybe six or eight tables.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.786
Now you get
maybe six or eight tables.

02:35.321 --> 02:36.422
It's scary.

02:36.489 --> 02:38.157
You have to ask yourself,

02:38.224 --> 02:39.425
"What did I do wrong?"

02:39.492 --> 02:40.727
So tonight sucked.

02:40.793 --> 02:42.362
Every night sucks here.

02:44.230 --> 02:46.432
We run out of things
on the menu all the time.

02:46.499 --> 02:48.501
We don't have
clam strips today.

02:48.568 --> 02:50.503
Hey, Dominick, why do we run
out of everything?

02:50.570 --> 02:51.471
How the  do I know?

02:51.537 --> 02:53.339
We haven't been busy.

02:53.406 --> 02:56.943
Dom's job here at the restaurant
is just to order the food,

02:57.009 --> 02:58.444
which is never done.

02:58.511 --> 02:59.746
It's always
kind of a problem.

02:59.812 --> 03:00.000
Dom, I need
some of that chicken.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.581
Dom, I need
some of that chicken.

03:01.647 --> 03:03.816
I hear you. You don't have
to tell me eight times.

03:05.284 --> 03:06.486
You need cucumbers
on the line?

03:06.552 --> 03:08.354
Yeah, no.
Yes.

03:08.421 --> 03:10.056
Yes, no,
which one is it?

03:10.123 --> 03:11.290
Hello?

03:11.357 --> 03:13.593
Nobody leads this restaurant.

03:13.659 --> 03:15.928
You got a bunch of followers
and no leaders.

03:15.995 --> 03:18.498
The problem with Colleen
and Naomi

03:18.598 --> 03:19.966
is they're too easygoing.

03:20.032 --> 03:21.267
There's more
of a friendly relationship

03:21.334 --> 03:23.703
with the workers
rather than business.

03:23.770 --> 03:24.971
It's ridiculous.

03:25.037 --> 03:26.372
Do you want to go
out there or no?

03:26.439 --> 03:27.707
I don't know.

03:27.774 --> 03:29.242
You know, the waitresses,

03:29.308 --> 03:30.000
they're texting
in between working.

03:30.000 --> 03:30.943
they're texting
in between working.

03:31.010 --> 03:32.512
Somebody's got to put
these kids in order.

03:32.578 --> 03:34.680
How many tables
were there?

03:34.747 --> 03:36.349
Not that many.

03:36.416 --> 03:37.750
Nobody's making money.

03:37.817 --> 03:39.886
We're not successful.

03:39.952 --> 03:43.322
And you're wondering how you're
gonna keep the doors open.

03:43.389 --> 03:45.591
Home sweet home.

03:45.658 --> 03:46.993
I was forced to move
back home.

03:47.059 --> 03:48.728
I live with my parents

03:48.795 --> 03:51.497
because I couldn't afford...

03:51.564 --> 03:54.033
I cry on the way to work,

03:54.100 --> 03:56.702
on the way home
from work.

03:56.769 --> 03:59.272
I cry about what
we've become here.

03:59.338 --> 04:00.000
And what are we gonna do?

04:00.000 --> 04:01.140
And what are we gonna do?

04:01.207 --> 04:04.110
It gets to a point
where you just dread being here.

04:04.177 --> 04:05.378
It kills me.

04:05.445 --> 04:07.213
It really kills me.

04:07.280 --> 04:08.981
We can't afford to close.

04:09.048 --> 04:11.551
We need someone
to show us the way.

04:25.932 --> 04:26.899
Hey.
How are you, sir?

04:26.999 --> 04:28.134
Dominick.
I'm the manager.

04:28.201 --> 04:29.202
How you doing?
Very well, thank you.

04:29.268 --> 04:30.000
Come on in. Have a seat.
My goodness.

04:30.000 --> 04:30.903
Come on in. Have a seat.
My goodness.

04:30.970 --> 04:32.572
Is this here the dining room?
It's so small.

04:32.638 --> 04:34.540
This is it.

04:36.976 --> 04:38.377
Obviously not much
to manage today.

04:38.444 --> 04:40.279
The place is empty.
Is it normally this quiet?

04:40.346 --> 04:42.148
On Saturdays, yeah.
Damn, damn, damn.

04:42.215 --> 04:43.783
Now, you look
like you've been

04:43.850 --> 04:44.884
in this business
for 30 years.

04:44.951 --> 04:46.652
I haven't.
Six years.

04:46.719 --> 04:48.154
What were you doing
before that?
Laying brick.

04:50.590 --> 04:51.624
It's you and who?

04:51.691 --> 04:52.825
Colleen and Naomi.
Okay.

04:52.892 --> 04:54.627
They own the place.
Okay, brilliant, yeah.

04:54.694 --> 04:55.795
I'm actually going out
with Colleen.

04:55.862 --> 04:57.163
You're going out
with Colleen?
Yeah.

04:57.230 --> 04:58.764
Oh, so you're going out
with one of the owners.

04:58.831 --> 04:59.966
Yeah.
Ex-customer?

05:00.032 --> 05:01.567
Yeah.
Right.

05:01.634 --> 05:03.135
Can I meet
the two owners?

05:03.202 --> 05:04.704
Dying to meet them.
Okay. Be right out.

05:04.770 --> 05:06.539
Bring them out, please.

05:06.606 --> 05:08.207
You know, this is Colleen
and Naomi's last resort.

05:08.274 --> 05:11.244
If Ramsay can't get this place
on the map,

05:11.310 --> 05:12.912
we might as well
just lock the  doors.

05:12.979 --> 05:15.548
Chef Gordon Ramsay,
Colleen and Naomi.

05:15.615 --> 05:17.550
Nice to meet you.
Colleen, nice to see you.

05:17.617 --> 05:19.318
Naomi, nice to meet you,
darling.

05:19.385 --> 05:21.287
Help me get up to speed

05:21.354 --> 05:22.522
with Classic American.

05:22.588 --> 05:23.723
How did you get
to own it, first off?

05:23.789 --> 05:25.124
We worked
for the previous owner.

05:25.191 --> 05:26.659
You were working
as a chef before?

05:26.726 --> 05:28.594
No, actually,
I was a waitress.

05:28.661 --> 05:29.962
Waitress. Wow.
And what were you doing?

05:30.029 --> 05:31.931
I was a waitress.
Incredible.

05:31.998 --> 05:33.599
And you bought it
from the owner?

05:33.666 --> 05:34.867
Yes.
How much?

05:34.934 --> 05:37.370
$240,000.
Really?

05:37.436 --> 05:38.738
Yeah.

05:38.804 --> 05:40.239
A quarter million dollars
for this?

05:40.306 --> 05:42.909
Just the business,
not the property.

05:42.975 --> 05:43.843
How much was that?

05:43.910 --> 05:44.944
That was $440,000.

05:45.011 --> 05:46.178
Wow.

05:46.245 --> 05:48.714
So in for 700 grand
so far.

05:48.781 --> 05:51.050
How long have you owned
the restaurant for?
Ten years.

05:51.117 --> 05:53.152
Straight up,
what do you think

05:53.219 --> 05:55.221
is the worst thing that's wrong
with the restaurant?

05:55.288 --> 05:56.789
Problem number one
would be what?

05:56.856 --> 05:58.958
What would you say?

05:59.025 --> 06:00.000
I don't think
it's just one thing.

06:00.000 --> 06:00.826
I don't think
it's just one thing.

06:00.893 --> 06:03.629
I think
it's a lot of things.
Give me one.

06:04.997 --> 06:06.766
Are you always normally
this quiet?

06:06.866 --> 06:08.467
No, I'm not.

06:08.534 --> 06:09.902
Chef Ramsay makes me nervous,

06:09.969 --> 06:12.138
because I'm out of answers.

06:12.204 --> 06:14.006
Maybe my eyes are closed,
you know.

06:14.073 --> 06:16.943
Maybe the head's so stuffed
that it's just not seeing

06:17.009 --> 06:18.144
what it needs to see.

06:18.210 --> 06:20.146
Okay, well, listen,

06:20.212 --> 06:21.681
I'm gonna have a good look
at the menu,

06:21.747 --> 06:24.350
taste the food,
and catch up later.

06:24.417 --> 06:26.953
Okay.

06:27.019 --> 06:30.000
"Enter as strangers,
leave as friends."

06:30.000 --> 06:30.556
"Enter as strangers,
leave as friends."

06:30.623 --> 06:33.326
Enter as a stranger,
start dating the owner.

06:35.061 --> 06:36.629
Here you go, sir.

06:36.696 --> 06:37.663
Oh. Hello.
How are you today?

06:37.763 --> 06:38.798
Very well, thank you.
How are you?

06:38.864 --> 06:39.799
I'm Ashleigh.
Ashleigh.

06:39.865 --> 06:40.833
I'll be your server.
Okay, great.

06:40.900 --> 06:42.368
I am freaking out.

06:42.435 --> 06:44.637
Having Chef Ramsay come
is very nerve-racking.

06:44.704 --> 06:46.439
I could throw up
right now.

06:46.505 --> 06:48.240
So how long
have you been here?
Ten years.

06:48.307 --> 06:50.776
Ten years, my God--
everyone's been here

06:50.843 --> 06:51.944
for a substantial length
of time.
Mm-hmm.

06:52.011 --> 06:53.045
Why have you been
so loyal?

06:53.112 --> 06:54.880
It's like
a little family.

06:54.947 --> 06:58.851
Great.
Wow. Huge menu.

06:58.918 --> 07:00.000
- About 100 options there.
- Yes.

07:00.000 --> 07:00.152
- About 100 options there.
- Yes.

07:00.219 --> 07:02.688
Help me out.
You could do
fried calamari.

07:02.755 --> 07:04.323
It's very good.
Is it?

07:04.390 --> 07:06.325
Mm-hmm.
It's one of my favorites.

07:06.392 --> 07:08.694
Let's go for the fried calamari
over Caesar salad.

07:08.761 --> 07:10.329
Okay.
And then I'd be stupid

07:10.363 --> 07:11.330
not to have the bomb.

07:11.397 --> 07:12.531
The bomb burger?
The bomb burger.

07:12.598 --> 07:13.633
Does it look like that?

07:13.699 --> 07:14.834
Uh, yeah.

07:15.935 --> 07:17.103
You know what?

07:17.169 --> 07:18.437
I'm a big lover
of mac and cheese.

07:18.504 --> 07:19.805
Do you have
any mac and cheese?
Yes.

07:19.872 --> 07:21.173
Yeah, lovely.
And that'll be all?

07:21.240 --> 07:22.341
Brilliant.
You got it.

07:22.408 --> 07:23.943
Thank you.
Thank you.

07:24.043 --> 07:25.344
Order.

07:25.411 --> 07:26.812
You want to throw in
a macaroni and cheese?

07:26.879 --> 07:28.848
1:50.

07:35.821 --> 07:37.423
Order up, Ash.

07:38.824 --> 07:40.593
That's my mac and cheese.
Thank you.

07:40.660 --> 07:43.629
That was very fast
for mac and cheese, my God.

07:43.696 --> 07:45.364
Probably pre-made.

07:48.601 --> 07:49.669
Eh.

07:49.735 --> 07:51.404
It's a mouthful of goo.

07:51.470 --> 07:52.571
That's gross.

07:52.638 --> 07:54.040
Uh-oh.

07:54.106 --> 07:55.474
That doesn't even taste
like it's been cooked here.

07:55.541 --> 07:57.510
We don't make
the mac and cheese here.

07:57.576 --> 07:59.045
No, it tastes like it.
Is that a big hit?

07:59.111 --> 08:00.000
No.
The kids eat it.

08:00.000 --> 08:00.279
No.
The kids eat it.

08:00.346 --> 08:01.380
Really?

08:01.480 --> 08:02.848
Yeah, that's dreadful.

08:02.915 --> 08:05.251
Poor kids, damn.

08:05.317 --> 08:06.819
You'd think a menu
with Classic American,

08:06.886 --> 08:07.887
you'd at least make
your mac and cheese, right?

08:07.953 --> 08:09.722
Yeah.
Not good.

08:09.789 --> 08:11.657
Like, I'm really sorry.

08:11.724 --> 08:13.192
I don't really know
what to say,

08:13.259 --> 08:15.261
because I'm not the one making
the food--I'm just serving it.

08:15.327 --> 08:17.063
What'd he say?

08:17.129 --> 08:18.931
That it was gross.

08:18.998 --> 08:22.334
Let's just hope
he doesn't run to the bathroom.

08:22.401 --> 08:23.602
Here you go.

08:23.669 --> 08:26.138
Oh.
Fried calamari
over Caesar salad.

08:26.205 --> 08:27.440
Let's taste.

08:31.877 --> 08:33.379
Not good.

08:33.479 --> 08:35.981
The calamari's really soft
and sort of chewy.

08:36.082 --> 08:37.083
Touch that.

08:37.149 --> 08:39.118
Oh.

08:39.185 --> 08:42.588
Uh, I don't think I really
should be touching food.

08:42.655 --> 08:43.789
Yeah, don't worry.
It won't bite.

08:43.856 --> 08:46.258
Yeah, it's soft.

08:47.626 --> 08:48.794
Is this fresh,
or is this frozen?

08:48.861 --> 08:49.895
'Cause it tastes frozen.

08:49.962 --> 08:51.430
Yeah, it is frozen.

08:51.497 --> 08:52.565
Dreadful.

08:52.631 --> 08:54.333
Anyway,
definitely not for me.

08:54.400 --> 08:56.435
I'm finished. Thank you.
Okay, you're welcome.

08:56.502 --> 08:58.738
How we making out, Ash?

08:58.804 --> 09:00.000
He said
they were gross--

09:00.000 --> 09:00.339
He said
they were gross--

09:00.439 --> 09:01.841
soft and chewy.

09:01.907 --> 09:04.977
What's soft and chewy?
The calamari.

09:05.044 --> 09:07.680
It's not crispy..

09:07.747 --> 09:09.982
It wasn't a great feeling
when he was sending back

09:10.049 --> 09:12.118
all the food, you know--
it's what we do every day.

09:12.184 --> 09:13.753
We think we do
a pretty good job.

09:13.819 --> 09:15.321
He wants the bomb next.

09:15.387 --> 09:17.323
Everyone loves the bomb.

09:17.389 --> 09:19.158
It's one
of our house specialties.

09:19.225 --> 09:21.160
He's definitely going
to enjoy that one.

09:21.227 --> 09:23.129
The bomb burger.

09:23.195 --> 09:24.630
Wow.

09:24.730 --> 09:26.532
Nice toasted bun.

09:26.599 --> 09:28.634
Where's the burger?

09:28.734 --> 09:30.000
Ah, there she is.

09:30.000 --> 09:30.803
Ah, there she is.

09:30.870 --> 09:33.205
There is a burger.

09:41.380 --> 09:43.582
How is everything?
Bad.

09:43.649 --> 09:45.084
Does anyone season food
in there?

09:45.151 --> 09:48.521
Season it?
Yeah, salt, pepper.

09:48.587 --> 09:50.523
We don't add anything
to it.

09:50.589 --> 09:53.092
Wow. The meat's
really chewy.

09:53.192 --> 09:54.293
That is chewy as hell.

09:54.360 --> 09:55.828
Will you ask the chef
to taste that?

09:55.895 --> 09:57.530
Okay.
Damn.

09:57.596 --> 09:58.664
Thank you.
You're welcome.

10:01.100 --> 10:02.768
He said
the burger's really chewy.

10:02.835 --> 10:04.870
He said try it.

10:06.172 --> 10:08.474
He's right.

10:08.541 --> 10:09.842
It's chewy?

10:09.909 --> 10:12.311
Uh-huh. That's weird.

10:12.378 --> 10:15.548
It says on the menu,
"The way mom used to make."

10:15.614 --> 10:16.749
That has to be
the biggest insult

10:16.816 --> 10:18.350
to every mother in America.

10:18.417 --> 10:22.088
It's embarrassing, because those
are our most popular dishes.

10:22.155 --> 10:23.556
I was really shocked.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.058
This is
the kitchen here, right?

10:25.124 --> 10:27.393
Can I meet the chefs?
Introduce me to the team.

10:27.460 --> 10:28.928
This is Kevin,
my son.

10:28.995 --> 10:29.929
How are you doing?
How are you?

10:29.996 --> 10:30.000
Nice to meet you.
Likewise.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.130
Nice to meet you.
Likewise.

10:31.197 --> 10:32.765
So you're the head chef?
Yes.

10:32.865 --> 10:34.267
And this is your...

10:34.334 --> 10:35.635
Son.
Son. Right.

10:35.702 --> 10:38.504
On a scale of one to ten,
rate the food at the restaurant.

10:38.571 --> 10:40.740
Between six and seven.

10:40.807 --> 10:42.041
Six and seven.

10:42.108 --> 10:43.009
I would have said six.

10:43.109 --> 10:45.278
Half it
and take two away,

10:45.345 --> 10:47.847
and you're on my mark.

10:49.315 --> 10:50.583
Personally,
I like the food.

10:50.650 --> 10:51.984
But what the
do I know?

10:52.051 --> 10:55.154
I was a bricklayer.
You know what I'm saying?

10:55.221 --> 10:57.757
Let me tell you straight
and honest, okay?

10:57.824 --> 10:59.258
The menu's hideous

10:59.325 --> 11:00.000
in a dining room
that's miserable.

11:00.000 --> 11:00.560
in a dining room
that's miserable.

11:00.626 --> 11:02.328
The food's depressing,
and you've got

11:02.395 --> 11:04.330
the audacity
to call it Classic American.

11:04.397 --> 11:05.765
You can't even get
a burger right.

11:05.832 --> 11:07.967
We eat the burgers here.

11:08.034 --> 11:09.502
Most nights,
we're proud of our food.

11:09.569 --> 11:10.703
Seriously?

11:10.770 --> 11:12.605
Yes.
Yeah.

11:12.672 --> 11:14.574
I'm really sorry,
but your food.

11:14.640 --> 11:17.310
I'm a little pissed off
right now.

11:17.377 --> 11:19.445
I couldn't believe
that he said that.

11:19.512 --> 11:20.613
You're a young chef

11:20.680 --> 11:23.082
standing by your mother.

11:23.149 --> 11:24.484
Totally respect that.

11:24.550 --> 11:26.386
But you're pulling it down.

11:26.452 --> 11:27.587
And to think

11:27.653 --> 11:29.021
that your rating
was seven out of ten,

11:29.088 --> 11:30.000
mate, you've got issues.

11:30.000 --> 11:30.923
mate, you've got issues.

11:32.091 --> 11:33.493
And as owners

11:33.559 --> 11:34.794
with a huge responsibility
on your shoulders,

11:34.861 --> 11:37.096
it's like you guys
have disappeared.

11:37.163 --> 11:38.564
You're screwed.

11:38.664 --> 11:40.266
It's not that I don't try.

11:40.333 --> 11:43.536
And I have not given up.

11:43.603 --> 11:44.837
God.

11:44.904 --> 11:46.739
I tried to do my best.

11:46.806 --> 11:48.307
It's not that I don't care,

11:48.374 --> 11:50.109
and it's not
that we're trying

11:50.176 --> 11:51.477
to take shortcuts.

11:51.544 --> 11:53.579
But we've cut back
on the payroll,

11:53.646 --> 11:55.848
and she's got a baby,
and she can't be here,

11:55.915 --> 11:57.316
and he's got a baby,

11:57.383 --> 11:58.584
and I can't afford
to pay him.

11:58.651 --> 12:00.000
And I need to pay my people.

12:00.000 --> 12:00.653
And I need to pay my people.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.221
It's not a comfortable
position to be in.

12:02.288 --> 12:04.724
I can see that, but it
doesn't stop you from trying.

12:04.791 --> 12:07.260
So who's on the payroll here?

12:07.326 --> 12:08.928
We don't--
we're not on payroll.

12:08.995 --> 12:10.363
So not even the owners
are getting paid?

12:10.463 --> 12:13.266
We haven't gotten paid
in over a year.

12:13.332 --> 12:14.667
I moved back home.

12:14.734 --> 12:16.202
I live with my parents.

12:18.471 --> 12:21.407
I knew you had
your problems,

12:21.474 --> 12:22.909
but I didn't think
it was gonna be that bad.

12:22.975 --> 12:25.545
The situation is actually worse
than I thought it would be.

12:25.645 --> 12:27.513
I'm gonna go for a walk.

12:27.580 --> 12:28.915
I got to do
some thinking.

12:28.981 --> 12:30.000
And I'll see you tonight.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.350
And I'll see you tonight.

12:31.417 --> 12:35.054
God, it's depressing.

12:35.121 --> 12:38.458
His first impression
was that we didn't care.

12:38.524 --> 12:40.860
It made me realize
we lost our way.

12:40.927 --> 12:42.862
Come on.
Come here. Come here.

12:42.929 --> 12:45.465
Come on.
Come on.

12:45.531 --> 12:47.600
He's right, you know?

12:49.936 --> 12:51.637
Don't feel bad.

12:51.704 --> 12:53.639
It's gotten to the point
where this ain't no joke.

12:53.706 --> 12:55.174
There's a lot at stake.

12:55.241 --> 12:59.579
You need a fresh set of eyes.
That's what you need.

12:59.645 --> 13:00.000
I'm scared.

13:00.000 --> 13:00.847
I'm scared.

13:00.913 --> 13:01.914
Don't worry about it.
It'll be all right.

13:01.981 --> 13:04.317
Maybe we're a lost cause.

13:18.824 --> 13:19.891
After a lunch

13:19.958 --> 13:21.493
in which
Classic American dishes

13:21.560 --> 13:23.661
were more disgusting
than classic,

13:23.728 --> 13:25.830
Chef Ramsay looks to observe
how the restaurant functions

13:25.897 --> 13:27.198
in a dinner service.

13:27.265 --> 13:29.100
I'll have
the ultimate combo.

13:29.167 --> 13:30.869
Soup--can I get
the bisque?

13:30.935 --> 13:32.937
Can I do sweet-potato fries?
Sure.

13:33.004 --> 13:34.439
Great.
Thank you.

13:34.506 --> 13:35.573
What's your strength?

13:35.673 --> 13:36.908
I'm not really sure.

13:37.008 --> 13:38.209
You're not really sure?

13:38.276 --> 13:40.178
I'm good
with the customers.
Right.

13:40.245 --> 13:41.613
And yet you work
behind the scenes.

13:41.679 --> 13:42.558
You don't in front
of the customers?

13:42.558 --> 13:43.181
You don't in front
of the customers?

13:43.248 --> 13:44.249
Wow.

13:44.315 --> 13:45.383
And what are you doing?

13:45.483 --> 13:46.684
Are you running around?

13:46.751 --> 13:47.619
I'm the busboy.
You're the busboy.

13:47.685 --> 13:49.554
I do whatever they tell me.

13:49.621 --> 13:51.289
When Chef Ramsay
said hi to me,

13:51.356 --> 13:53.391
I just looked up at him,
'cause I was scared.

13:53.458 --> 13:54.793
His hair's a little crazy.

13:54.859 --> 13:57.028
Even though it looks soft,
it's like, whoosh.

13:59.063 --> 14:01.633
Order.
So when the tickets come on,

14:01.699 --> 14:02.901
where's your tab go?

14:02.967 --> 14:04.269
They were originally
coming out here.

14:04.335 --> 14:05.537
This broke, so now
they handwrite the tickets.

14:05.603 --> 14:06.504
Really?

14:06.571 --> 14:08.740
We used to have a computer,

14:08.807 --> 14:11.643
but somebody spilled coffee
all over the register

14:11.743 --> 14:12.558
and burnt it out.

14:12.558 --> 14:13.244
and burnt it out.

14:13.311 --> 14:15.980
We can't afford to fix it.

14:16.047 --> 14:17.482
Ashleigh,
what does this say?

14:19.317 --> 14:20.618
Oh, focaccia bread.

14:20.685 --> 14:22.253
Reuben, cut me
two focaccias.

14:22.320 --> 14:25.156
Ashleigh,
write the tickets better.

14:25.223 --> 14:27.959
So do the tickets take
a lot longer to handwrite?

14:28.026 --> 14:29.294
Well, if the writing
is sloppy,

14:29.360 --> 14:31.362
it tends to get
a little confusing.

14:31.429 --> 14:32.664
How long's
the printer been down?

14:32.764 --> 14:33.731
Six months maybe.

14:33.798 --> 14:35.733
Oh,.

14:35.800 --> 14:37.268
Order up.

14:37.335 --> 14:38.603
Even with handwritten tickets...

14:38.670 --> 14:40.271
Order up.
Order up.

14:40.338 --> 14:41.973
- Order up.
- Naomi and Kevin

14:42.040 --> 14:42.558
manage to push out the food
at a rapid pace.

14:42.558 --> 14:44.242
manage to push out the food
at a rapid pace.

14:44.309 --> 14:45.410
Thank you.
You're welcome.

14:45.477 --> 14:47.078
God, the food goes out fast,
doesn't it?

14:47.145 --> 14:48.079
Pretty fast.

14:49.914 --> 14:51.349
Excuse me.
This isn't hot.

14:51.416 --> 14:52.917
Unfortunately,

14:52.984 --> 14:56.488
the fast food
is not exactly pleasing

14:56.554 --> 14:58.823
to many of the customers.
just kind of soggy.

14:58.890 --> 14:59.858
What's wrong with that?

14:59.924 --> 15:01.659
They said the shrimp
is no good.

15:03.561 --> 15:04.562
What is that?

15:04.629 --> 15:05.797
Garlic white wine.
Wow.

15:05.864 --> 15:07.899
No good?.

15:07.966 --> 15:10.835
The food coming back
used to upset me more.

15:10.902 --> 15:12.558
But it's happened
so often

15:12.558 --> 15:13.071
But it's happened
so often

15:13.137 --> 15:16.207
that I just become numb
to it.

15:16.274 --> 15:18.176
Does anyone ever get bothered
about all the food coming back?

15:18.243 --> 15:20.078
Yes. Yes.

15:20.144 --> 15:22.480
It just seems like everybody's
taking it in stride.

15:22.547 --> 15:24.048
I got you.

15:24.115 --> 15:25.216
I'm lost for words.

15:25.316 --> 15:26.851
I don't know what to do.

15:26.918 --> 15:29.153
You all right?
I'm taking it all in.

15:29.220 --> 15:30.955
Likewise.
I know the feeling.

15:31.022 --> 15:33.825
Colleen, hey, listen,
I know you're stressed

15:33.892 --> 15:35.293
and you got a lot
on your mind,

15:35.360 --> 15:38.463
but take the reins
and run your restaurant.

15:38.530 --> 15:41.232
What can I get for you?

15:41.299 --> 15:42.558
Can I have spicy tender
appetizer and burger?

15:42.558 --> 15:43.134
Can I have spicy tender
appetizer and burger?

15:43.201 --> 15:44.836
There is no more.

15:44.903 --> 15:46.170
Teresa, no burgers.

15:46.237 --> 15:47.338
We're out?

15:47.405 --> 15:48.473
Yeah. You're gonna have
to 86 'em.

15:48.540 --> 15:50.642
How can we 86 a burger?
Sorry.

15:50.708 --> 15:52.410
With owner Colleen

15:52.477 --> 15:54.178
Completely shutting down...

15:54.245 --> 15:55.914
I really need that chicken
for table ten.

15:56.014 --> 15:58.116
You're gonna have to wait.

15:58.182 --> 15:59.751
A leaderless Classic American

15:59.817 --> 16:01.986
Runs into problems...
Table three
wants meatloaf.

16:02.053 --> 16:03.087
We don't have meatloaf.

16:03.154 --> 16:04.289
After problems...

16:04.355 --> 16:05.390
We have no cup, Jay.

16:05.456 --> 16:07.258
I need these cleaned
immediately.

16:07.358 --> 16:08.693
After problems...

16:08.793 --> 16:10.094
Crazy.

16:10.161 --> 16:11.896
Leaving
the customers unhappy...

16:14.098 --> 16:16.067
And the staff frustrated.

16:16.134 --> 16:17.468
Table 56

16:17.535 --> 16:19.103
Has been waiting 18 minutes

16:19.170 --> 16:21.506
for something to drink,
'cause I have no cup.

16:21.573 --> 16:23.374
I know Colleen's
really stressed out,

16:23.441 --> 16:24.609
but how could you run
a business

16:24.676 --> 16:25.610
when you don't have
enough silverware,

16:25.677 --> 16:26.878
you don't have enough cups?

16:26.945 --> 16:28.346
Can I have a cup?

16:28.413 --> 16:29.881
Uh...
There's none in there?

16:29.948 --> 16:31.416
There's none in there.

16:31.482 --> 16:33.017
You know, who'd want to come
to a restaurant like that

16:33.084 --> 16:34.552
that's so unorganized?
I wouldn't.

16:34.619 --> 16:36.254
I need soup cups.
Can you please wash 'em out?

16:36.354 --> 16:37.855
There's nothing here.

16:37.922 --> 16:39.557
There's two
in there right now.
Oh, my God.

16:39.624 --> 16:40.658
No soup cups--

16:40.725 --> 16:42.558
Like, how do they
expect me to serve?

16:42.558 --> 16:42.794
Like, how do they
expect me to serve?

16:42.860 --> 16:44.195
Hey, guys.
Guys, guys.

16:44.262 --> 16:45.863
Wash dishes.

16:45.930 --> 16:47.632
I can't.

16:47.699 --> 16:49.267
I got to--
I can't do this tonight.

16:49.334 --> 16:50.868
I really can't.

16:50.935 --> 16:52.370
I can't. You got
to go  work the line,

16:52.437 --> 16:55.173
because I'm  losing
my mind.

17:05.738 --> 17:07.340
Two hours into dinner service,

17:07.406 --> 17:09.608
the kitchen has run out
of everything,

17:09.675 --> 17:11.477
from burgers...
Teresa, no burgers.

17:11.544 --> 17:12.878
We're out?

17:12.945 --> 17:13.980
To coffee.

17:14.046 --> 17:15.348
Is the coffee even good?
No, don't do that.

17:15.414 --> 17:16.615
And owner Colleen

17:16.682 --> 17:18.317
has just run out of patience.

17:18.384 --> 17:19.752
I can't.

17:19.819 --> 17:21.887
I got to--
I can't do this tonight.

17:21.954 --> 17:23.656
I really can't.

17:34.133 --> 17:35.167
What's the matter?

17:38.170 --> 17:40.139
I've been fighting
a losing battle every day.

17:40.206 --> 17:42.942
You're standing there,
and you're not getting anywhere.

17:43.009 --> 17:45.111
And I just keep going
and going and going.

17:45.211 --> 17:47.580
You understand?

17:47.646 --> 17:49.648
I do understand.

17:49.715 --> 17:51.684
I feel disappointed
in myself.

17:51.751 --> 17:54.487
I feel
like I've failed.

17:54.553 --> 17:58.457
And I've tried hard,
you know.

17:58.524 --> 18:01.327
At the end
of the day...

18:01.394 --> 18:01.854
it's your family,
and it's your friends.

18:01.854 --> 18:04.230
it's your family,
and it's your friends.

18:04.296 --> 18:07.933
And it's not malicious,
and nobody's out to hurt,

18:08.000 --> 18:10.736
but I'm frustrated,
and I'm angry.

18:10.803 --> 18:13.339
And I'm scared.
I'm really, really scared.

18:13.406 --> 18:17.076
I feel I have more to lose
than anybody else in this place.

18:17.143 --> 18:19.345
Excuse me.

18:19.412 --> 18:21.881
Here's the honest truth.

18:21.947 --> 18:25.785
The standards
have been accepted too low,

18:25.851 --> 18:30.089
and in amongst those standards,
there's a big friendship.

18:30.156 --> 18:31.854
Friendship's got  all
to do with it,

18:31.854 --> 18:32.091
Friendship's got  all
to do with it,

18:32.158 --> 18:34.994
'cause there's no friends
when that place is closed.

18:35.061 --> 18:37.463
They get their next job
six months, three months,

18:37.530 --> 18:39.665
two weeks,
they move on.

18:39.732 --> 18:41.967
And you'll spend
the rest of your life

18:42.034 --> 18:43.836
reducing that  debt.

18:43.903 --> 18:45.604
You're right.

18:45.671 --> 18:47.306
You're absolutely right.

18:49.508 --> 18:50.810
I need this to stay.

18:50.876 --> 18:52.778
Yeah, but it's not
gonna get better

18:52.845 --> 18:54.447
if you keep on doing
the same thing.

18:54.547 --> 18:56.182
Right, and I know that.

18:56.282 --> 18:59.552
You cannot give up.

18:59.618 --> 19:00.586
Okay?

19:00.653 --> 19:01.854
Well...

19:01.854 --> 19:02.721
Well...

19:02.788 --> 19:04.990
Let's go and finish
the service, yeah?

19:05.057 --> 19:08.828
I've never met a woman
with as much

19:08.894 --> 19:10.663
on their shoulders
as Colleen.

19:10.729 --> 19:12.031
And today's been a bad day,

19:12.098 --> 19:14.500
but tomorrow I'm gonna have
to pick her up

19:14.567 --> 19:16.435
and get those standards
up there,

19:16.502 --> 19:18.304
and she's got to set
an example.

19:21.874 --> 19:23.742
In his first 24 hours,

19:23.809 --> 19:26.780
Chef Ramsay realized
that there are many problems

19:26.846 --> 19:28.014
at Classic American.

19:28.081 --> 19:29.282
And high on his priority list

19:29.349 --> 19:31.854
is fixing the lack
of communication.

19:31.854 --> 19:32.418
is fixing the lack
of communication.

19:32.485 --> 19:36.156
There's an exercise this morning
that I need everybody

19:36.222 --> 19:37.223
to be open to.

19:37.290 --> 19:38.358
I want to find out

19:38.424 --> 19:40.627
the problems you have
with each other.

19:40.693 --> 19:42.462
I want each of you

19:42.529 --> 19:44.264
to write down

19:44.330 --> 19:45.832
two questions,

19:45.899 --> 19:47.100
two issues.

19:47.167 --> 19:48.268
Ask anything you want.

19:48.334 --> 19:49.402
Open house.

19:49.469 --> 19:51.638
This is not gonna go well.

19:51.704 --> 19:54.374
People don't like
to be confronted here.

19:54.440 --> 19:55.542
Thank you.

19:55.608 --> 19:57.043
Okay.

19:57.177 --> 19:58.144
So on the questions,

19:58.211 --> 20:00.580
Colleen, why do you always

20:00.647 --> 20:01.854
seem frustrated
at the waitresses?

20:01.854 --> 20:02.749
seem frustrated
at the waitresses?

20:05.218 --> 20:06.152
Here we go.

20:06.219 --> 20:08.121
Because...

20:08.188 --> 20:10.190
when these customers
walk through that door,

20:10.256 --> 20:12.959
you're the first person
that they see.

20:13.026 --> 20:14.627
And they're not
getting service.

20:14.694 --> 20:17.430
If they're sitting there and
you're texting on your phone,

20:17.497 --> 20:19.165
they're paying customers.

20:19.232 --> 20:21.034
They deserve your attention,

20:21.100 --> 20:24.370
not the person on the phone.

20:24.437 --> 20:25.605
Ashleigh, Teresa,
you don't text

20:25.672 --> 20:27.540
in the middle of service
when customers are waiting

20:27.607 --> 20:29.742
for stuff, though,
do you?

20:31.544 --> 20:31.854
You text
when customers are...

20:31.854 --> 20:34.047
You text
when customers are...

20:34.113 --> 20:35.782
Wow.

20:35.849 --> 20:37.116
Naomi,

20:37.183 --> 20:38.952
why are you
such a pushover?

20:39.018 --> 20:40.787
Because they're
my family.

20:40.854 --> 20:43.323
They're not, though.

20:43.389 --> 20:45.558
Your family's at home,
and this is your business.

20:45.625 --> 20:47.393
And the difference
is night and day.

20:47.460 --> 20:48.595
You have to change.

20:48.661 --> 20:49.662
I have to work
on that.

20:49.729 --> 20:51.564
Okay, Dom.

20:51.631 --> 20:54.300
Why are we always running out
of product?

20:54.367 --> 20:55.768
I don't close every night.

20:55.835 --> 20:58.538
At the end of the day,
everything's got to be stocked

20:58.605 --> 21:00.406
and written down
what we need.

21:00.473 --> 21:01.854
But...

21:01.854 --> 21:02.108
But...

21:02.175 --> 21:03.543
I'm right.
You're not right.

21:03.610 --> 21:07.046
Before you make
an order, okay,

21:07.113 --> 21:08.615
you need
to go through everything.

21:08.681 --> 21:10.717
Who's not feeding you
the right information?

21:10.783 --> 21:12.385
He doesn't wait
for information.

21:12.452 --> 21:13.453
He just goes.

21:13.519 --> 21:14.888
I just got through
telling you.

21:14.954 --> 21:16.689
I don't close
every  night.

21:16.756 --> 21:18.591
You're always so defensive.

21:18.658 --> 21:20.026
I'm not  defensive.
We're not picking on you.

21:20.093 --> 21:22.262
You always got an answer.
You always got to come back.

21:22.328 --> 21:23.396
- That's right.
- I got a  comment

21:23.463 --> 21:24.831
about every  thing,

21:24.898 --> 21:26.165
because when I open
my  mouth,

21:26.232 --> 21:28.067
everybody shrugs
their shoulders

21:28.134 --> 21:29.535
and gets a  attitude.

21:29.602 --> 21:30.870
Because you do it
all the time.
That's why.

21:30.937 --> 21:31.854
'Cause I see something wrong--

21:31.854 --> 21:32.572
'Cause I see something wrong--

21:32.639 --> 21:34.474
'cause I see something wrong,

21:34.540 --> 21:36.342
and I say something,

21:36.409 --> 21:38.444
and she don't want to be
bothered--she's spent.

21:38.511 --> 21:40.346
You'd rather walk around
pissed off.

21:40.413 --> 21:42.882
This is the problem.
Is it you? Is it him?

21:42.949 --> 21:45.084
Is it me?
Is it her?

21:45.151 --> 21:47.320
Who? Who?
It's everybody.

21:47.387 --> 21:50.590
No!
Yeah, it is everybody!

21:50.657 --> 21:52.325
It don't take one person
to run a business.

21:52.392 --> 21:54.027
You need a  team.

21:54.093 --> 21:56.095
You need a team,
but you need a chief.

21:56.162 --> 21:57.830
Exactly. And there ain't
no  chief here.

21:57.897 --> 22:00.800
Who signs
the  checks--

22:00.867 --> 22:01.854
You or us?
Okay.
You're right.

22:01.854 --> 22:03.269
You or us?
Okay.
You're right.

22:03.336 --> 22:07.073
I was ready to kill somebody.

22:07.140 --> 22:08.975
You don't disrespect me
like that.

22:09.041 --> 22:12.245
They gotta find a way
to  piss me off.

22:12.311 --> 22:13.913
This ain't no  joke.

22:13.980 --> 22:15.715
These girls are in debt
up to their heads.

22:15.782 --> 22:17.483
They gotta get it.

22:17.550 --> 22:20.720
We gotta stay
in business.

22:20.787 --> 22:23.556
Colleen, you and Naomi,

22:23.623 --> 22:26.559
you need to lead
this business.

22:26.626 --> 22:28.127
You need to be tough, Naomi,

22:28.194 --> 22:31.854
'cause if you're not, everybody
just does as they please.

22:31.854 --> 22:32.198
'cause if you're not, everybody
just does as they please.

22:32.265 --> 22:37.069
- Text, serve...
- off home.

22:37.136 --> 22:39.772
And if you cannot lead,

22:39.839 --> 22:43.576
you shouldn't have bought
this place.

22:43.643 --> 22:46.646
You shouldn't have
done it.

22:46.712 --> 22:48.181
Coming up...

22:48.247 --> 22:50.283
Table three has been waiting
a really long time.

22:50.349 --> 22:52.618
- Back off.
- Colleen can't take the heat.

22:52.685 --> 22:56.122
Stop going in my  ear
and let me work!

22:56.189 --> 22:57.590
Chef Ramsay can't take
the food.

22:57.657 --> 22:59.358
Look at that!

22:59.425 --> 23:01.828
And the owners are faced
with a frightening reality.

23:01.894 --> 23:03.763
If we are gonna continue
serving that,

23:03.830 --> 23:05.698
close your business.

23:05.765 --> 23:07.533
Close it!

23:07.600 --> 23:10.102
That's next
on Kitchen Nightmares.

23:18.730 --> 23:19.898
After an explosive...

23:19.964 --> 23:22.033
It's everybody!
No!

23:22.100 --> 23:24.269
- Yeah, it is everybody.
- Yet revealing...

23:24.335 --> 23:26.971
You need to lead
this business.

23:27.038 --> 23:28.039
Staff meeting...

23:28.106 --> 23:31.309
Naomi? Come here.
I need two seconds.

23:31.376 --> 23:33.411
Chef Ramsay knows he needs
to help Colleen and Naomi

23:33.478 --> 23:35.046
take charge
of their restaurant.

23:35.113 --> 23:36.247
I need to make sure
this service

23:36.314 --> 23:38.283
starts to go
the way we want it.

23:38.349 --> 23:40.685
And he begins by assigning
the owners new roles

23:40.752 --> 23:42.091
For tonight's dinner service.
I want you expediting,

23:42.091 --> 23:43.221
For tonight's dinner service.
I want you expediting,

23:43.288 --> 23:45.790
and I want you working
with these two.

23:45.857 --> 23:47.992
Boss in the kitchen, and boss
in the front of the house.

23:48.059 --> 23:50.228
I'm very anxious right now.

23:50.295 --> 23:51.496
It was a long time ago

23:51.562 --> 23:52.864
since I spent a night
in the dining room.

23:52.931 --> 23:54.432
You've got
to show me quickly

23:54.499 --> 23:56.334
why you own this place
and what it means to you.

23:56.401 --> 23:58.369
We're opening
in half an hour, yeah?

23:58.436 --> 23:59.437
Let's go.

24:03.174 --> 24:05.543
Time for some changes, yes?

24:05.610 --> 24:07.979
Chef Ramsay has also added
a special to tonight's menu...

24:08.046 --> 24:09.681
Fun sliders.

24:09.747 --> 24:12.091
Giving a modern spin
to an American Classic.

24:12.091 --> 24:12.550
Giving a modern spin
to an American Classic.

24:12.617 --> 24:15.987
They're sliders.
Fun and bite-size, yeah?

24:16.054 --> 24:19.457
That is 1,000 miles away
from the bomb burger.

24:19.524 --> 24:21.559
Yeah? Have a taste.
Ooh, this is good.

24:21.626 --> 24:23.294
How's that?
Perfect.

24:23.361 --> 24:26.130
Try and chew it before
you swallow it, yes? Easy.

24:26.197 --> 24:28.099
We have a slider special,

24:28.166 --> 24:29.867
Which I think they're gonna
sell out the door.

24:29.934 --> 24:31.636
I'm starting to feel like
this restaurant

24:31.703 --> 24:35.039
is taking a turn
for the better.

24:35.106 --> 24:37.375
You're not texting.
Sorry.

24:37.475 --> 24:39.344
No, no, no, no, no. No.

24:39.410 --> 24:41.813
What happened?
Who were you texting--

24:41.913 --> 24:42.091
salon, hair, nails?

24:42.091 --> 24:45.083
salon, hair, nails?

24:45.149 --> 24:47.885
I got busted
text-messaging.

24:54.258 --> 24:56.828
Run your business tonight,
and let's make one big step

24:56.894 --> 25:00.131
in the right direction, okay?
Let's go.

25:00.198 --> 25:01.866
How are you?
How many?
Four.

25:01.933 --> 25:03.468
Thank you
you're welcome.

25:03.534 --> 25:06.070
How are you? Two?

25:06.137 --> 25:07.605
As word of Chef Ramsay's
visit spreads...

25:07.672 --> 25:10.308
You can have a seat here. I'll
bring your menus right over.

25:10.375 --> 25:12.091
This once-quiet restaurant
is even busier

25:12.091 --> 25:12.710
This once-quiet restaurant
is even busier

25:12.810 --> 25:14.178
than the previous night.

25:14.245 --> 25:16.014
Your menus will be
right out.

25:16.080 --> 25:18.950
I have no more menus.

25:19.050 --> 25:20.318
I really need menus for 15.

25:20.385 --> 25:22.320
You want to take
an order on 11,

25:22.387 --> 25:23.721
so I can grab
those menus?

25:23.788 --> 25:25.857
You have to wait for a menu?
It's crazy.

25:25.923 --> 25:28.092
Why is it so slow?
We only have 13 menus.

25:28.159 --> 25:30.361
We only have how many?
13.

25:30.428 --> 25:32.530
You can have a seat right here.
Your menus will be right out.

25:32.597 --> 25:34.399
50 seats and 13 menus.

25:34.465 --> 25:37.535
Trust us to run out
on number 13, right?

25:37.602 --> 25:38.936
I just wanted to hide.

25:39.003 --> 25:40.405
There was people standing
at the door,

25:40.471 --> 25:42.006
and I was under
so much pressure.

25:42.073 --> 25:42.091
We didn't have enough money
to print any more menus,

25:42.091 --> 25:44.876
We didn't have enough money
to print any more menus,

25:44.942 --> 25:46.944
so we had what we had.

25:47.078 --> 25:49.814
13 menus?
You're kidding me.

25:49.881 --> 25:50.948
I told you
it was hell here.

25:51.015 --> 25:52.817
Yeah, you're right.
It's not far from hell.

25:52.884 --> 25:55.019
Naomi, sit
those customers down.

25:55.086 --> 25:56.287
We ran out of menus.

25:56.354 --> 25:58.022
I'd much rather they
sit down with no menu

25:58.089 --> 25:59.557
than stand in the corridor
staring at you.

25:59.624 --> 26:00.758
As soon as they're finished
with those menus,

26:00.825 --> 26:01.893
pass them on
to the next table.
Mm-hmm.

26:01.959 --> 26:05.329
Thank you.
Here you go.

26:05.396 --> 26:10.468
After a slow start
caused by the menu shortage...

26:10.535 --> 26:12.091
- The trio as your meal?
- Orders are finally taken...

26:12.091 --> 26:13.504
- The trio as your meal?
- Orders are finally taken...

26:13.571 --> 26:14.672
I'm gonna need
two more sliders.

26:14.739 --> 26:16.107
Many of which include

26:16.207 --> 26:19.043
Chef Ramsay's sliders...

26:19.110 --> 26:21.546
Which gets the evening off
on a positive note.

26:25.216 --> 26:26.484
They said
it was excellent.

26:26.551 --> 26:29.153
I need sliders,
mac and cheese,

26:29.220 --> 26:30.555
and crab cake app.
okay.

26:30.622 --> 26:31.956
Uh, Colleen?
Yes.

26:32.023 --> 26:33.858
Open up now, start getting
the team together.

26:33.925 --> 26:35.760
I'm trying. I'm trying.

26:35.827 --> 26:38.129
An hour into dinner service,
the kitchen,

26:38.196 --> 26:39.931
Led by Colleen
and her son Kevin,

26:39.998 --> 26:42.091
are having a hard time
keeping up with the orders.

26:42.091 --> 26:42.567
are having a hard time
keeping up with the orders.

26:42.634 --> 26:44.936
Table eight needs their food.
They've been waiting so long.

26:45.003 --> 26:46.604
She knows everyone's
waiting a long time, okay?

26:46.671 --> 26:48.006
What do you want me to do?

26:48.072 --> 26:49.941
And the mood in the dining room

26:50.008 --> 26:52.076
is starting to turn.
I can't even remember
what I ordered.

26:52.143 --> 26:54.145
If they don't make it now,
then we'll leave.

26:54.212 --> 26:55.713
The food
will be out shortly.

26:55.780 --> 26:57.548
Everything just snowballed.

26:57.615 --> 26:59.817
I was doing the best
that I could do.

26:59.884 --> 27:01.986
Table three has been waiting
a really long time.

27:02.053 --> 27:05.490
They're not waiting
any longer than these people.

27:05.556 --> 27:07.992
These tables came in
at 6:00.
Back off, please.

27:08.059 --> 27:09.928
You don't understand.
I understand.

27:09.994 --> 27:12.091
Stop going
in my  ear

27:12.091 --> 27:12.363
Stop going
in my  ear

27:12.430 --> 27:15.366
And let me work!
All right, all right,
all right.

27:15.433 --> 27:17.468
As Colleen begins to get a grip
of the kitchen once again...

27:17.535 --> 27:19.604
That's for table one.

27:19.671 --> 27:24.108
Food slowly makes its way
out to the diners.

27:24.175 --> 27:26.177
Blehh!

27:26.244 --> 27:29.147
But the customers are
far from impressed.

27:29.213 --> 27:30.715
Oh, my God,
how gross is that?

27:30.782 --> 27:31.983
Send it back,
it's terrible.

27:32.083 --> 27:33.351
Send it back.

27:33.418 --> 27:35.753
They didn't like
the calamari.

27:36.095 --> 27:39.082
Excuse me.
Can I get this plate less sauce?

27:39.082 --> 27:40.525
It's really spicy. Super spicy.

27:40.525 --> 27:42.091
It was crazy.

27:42.091 --> 27:42.260
It was crazy.

27:42.327 --> 27:43.661
He would like
less sauce.

27:43.728 --> 27:45.630
Definitely just want to bury
your head in the sand.

27:45.697 --> 27:47.231
How much sauce do you
normally put on that, Kevin?

27:47.298 --> 27:49.534
About that much sauce,
usually.
Take a bite of that.

27:49.600 --> 27:52.870
Tell me that's normal.
Yeah, it's normal.

27:57.408 --> 27:59.877
Kevin, if that's normal,
you're abnormal.

27:59.944 --> 28:02.947
Two Caesar salads
going to table 12.

28:03.014 --> 28:05.450
The mother-and-son team are
finally pushing food out...

28:05.516 --> 28:08.820
Where's that going?
Hold on, stop, stop.

28:08.886 --> 28:11.322
But a disturbing dish catches
Chef Ramsay's watchful eye.

28:11.389 --> 28:12.091
Look at that!
Just touch it!

28:12.091 --> 28:13.391
Look at that!
Just touch it!

28:13.458 --> 28:16.594
Plate of vegetables.
Fingers going right through it!

28:16.661 --> 28:20.698
This is the sorry state
that we've got ourselves into.

28:20.765 --> 28:22.867
If we are gonna continue
serving that,

28:22.934 --> 28:25.236
close your  business!

28:25.336 --> 28:28.006
Close it!

28:28.072 --> 28:30.274
I wouldn't serve that
to my dog!

28:34.011 --> 28:36.414
Stop! I wouldn't
serve that to my dog!

28:36.481 --> 28:38.483
Tonight's dinner service
has been plagued with problems.

28:38.549 --> 28:41.686
Stop going in my  ear
and let me work!

28:41.752 --> 28:44.956
Send it back.
It's terrible.
They didn't like the calamari.

28:45.022 --> 28:47.758
But this last broccoli dish...
Look at that!

28:47.825 --> 28:49.760
Was the last straw
for Chef Ramsay.

28:49.827 --> 28:52.830
If we are gonna continue
serving that,

28:52.897 --> 28:55.533
close your  business!
Close it!

29:01.038 --> 29:02.211
Teresa, could you deliver
that for me?

29:02.211 --> 29:02.773
Teresa, could you deliver
that for me?

29:02.840 --> 29:04.842
Stop! Stop!

29:04.909 --> 29:07.211
Don't send anything else.
Close it!

29:11.082 --> 29:13.818
We're closed.

29:13.885 --> 29:15.319
Yous are closed?

29:15.386 --> 29:17.088
Can I get a waitress
over here, please?

29:17.155 --> 29:20.258
I'm sorry, we're not
serving anymore. No.

29:20.324 --> 29:23.427
- Tonight was terrible.
- Tonight was a  nightmare.

29:27.231 --> 29:29.934
I don't want to face
Chef Ramsay.

29:30.001 --> 29:31.936
I don't want to face
my employees.

29:32.003 --> 29:32.211
I just wanted everybody
to go away,

29:32.211 --> 29:34.639
I just wanted everybody
to go away,

29:34.705 --> 29:37.074
because it was horrendous.

29:37.141 --> 29:39.410
Okay...

29:39.477 --> 29:41.612
Tonight was ridiculous!

29:41.679 --> 29:44.282
Instead of making progress,

29:44.348 --> 29:48.953
we went backwards more than
I ever thought was possible.

29:49.020 --> 29:53.291
Tonight I realized

29:53.357 --> 29:57.228
there's no way
this restaurant can survive...

30:00.865 --> 30:02.211
unless there's
a dramatic change.

30:02.211 --> 30:04.335
unless there's
a dramatic change.

30:04.402 --> 30:05.703
Tomorrow,
from the minute you arrive,

30:05.770 --> 30:08.005
there's gonna be change
after change after change.

30:08.105 --> 30:09.874
Get ready for that.

30:09.941 --> 30:10.942
Agreed?
Agreed.

30:11.008 --> 30:11.976
Yes.

30:12.043 --> 30:13.811
Good night.

30:13.878 --> 30:16.480
We just lost our way.

30:16.547 --> 30:19.350
I'm hoping Chef Ramsay
can put us back on track.

30:25.189 --> 30:27.925
Chef Ramsay knows that this
dysfunctional restaurant needs

30:27.992 --> 30:30.194
a massive overhaul
in order for it to have

30:30.261 --> 30:31.429
any chance of surviving.

30:31.495 --> 30:32.211
So he goes to work immediately

30:32.211 --> 30:32.863
So he goes to work immediately

30:32.930 --> 30:34.365
after the staff leaves,

30:34.432 --> 30:37.401
working through the night
to give Classic American

30:37.501 --> 30:42.006
a dramatic makeover.

30:42.073 --> 30:43.741
- Right, good morning.
- Good morning.

30:43.808 --> 30:44.942
Ready to see
your new restaurant?

30:45.009 --> 30:46.877
I'm ready to see
the new restaurant.
Yes.

30:46.944 --> 30:48.779
Okay, guys, let's go.

30:48.846 --> 30:52.016
The new Classic American.
Oh, my...

30:52.083 --> 30:53.184
Come in, come in.

30:53.251 --> 30:55.553
Here's your floor.
Holy...

30:57.188 --> 30:58.589
Come in, come in.

30:58.656 --> 31:02.059
Colleen, come in.
I love it.

31:02.126 --> 31:02.211
Gone is the old country-style
whatever it was,

31:02.211 --> 31:05.663
Gone is the old country-style
whatever it was,

31:05.730 --> 31:09.133
And welcome
to the new Classic American.

31:10.768 --> 31:13.638
Beautiful, light, vibrant!

31:13.704 --> 31:15.072
- Oh, my God.
- What do you think, Colleen?

31:15.139 --> 31:20.044
Talk to me, darling!
Are you happy?

31:20.111 --> 31:21.279
I'm jumping out
of my skin.

31:21.345 --> 31:24.415
This is more than
I could imagine.

31:24.482 --> 31:27.885
And it's nice to have tears
of happiness instead of sadness.

31:27.952 --> 31:30.521
Naomi, what do you think?

31:30.588 --> 31:32.211
It looks great.

31:32.211 --> 31:32.323
It looks great.

31:32.390 --> 31:35.493
We got rid of those
horrendous table cloths.

31:35.559 --> 31:38.663
Now we've got some vibe, some
lightness, some excitement.

31:38.729 --> 31:42.099
This place is gonna be
so busy,

31:42.166 --> 31:45.770
you won't have time to start
handwriting tickets.

31:45.836 --> 31:47.138
You're going to need to work
with something

31:47.204 --> 31:48.506
that is
from the 21st century.

31:48.572 --> 31:51.075
And in here,
this is a state-of-the-art

31:51.142 --> 31:53.978
P.O.S. system
installed by Halo.

31:54.045 --> 31:56.213
Wow.
Absolutely amazing.

31:56.280 --> 31:59.417
Stock control,
price check.

31:59.517 --> 32:01.385
Dom, those arguments about,

32:01.452 --> 32:02.211
"I'm going for bread.
I'm going for potatoes.

32:02.211 --> 32:02.953
"I'm going for bread.
I'm going for potatoes.

32:03.020 --> 32:04.255
We need chicken.
We need ground beef"--

32:04.322 --> 32:06.590
It's all in there.
Good.

32:06.657 --> 32:08.759
Gordon got us
this awesome computer.

32:08.826 --> 32:10.428
It does everything
but wipe your.

32:10.494 --> 32:12.797
I'm afraid to touch it.
I'm gonna break it.

32:12.863 --> 32:16.400
Okay, there's one more thing.

32:16.467 --> 32:18.969
I need you
to come outside.

32:20.371 --> 32:23.741
Here, there we are.

32:23.808 --> 32:26.444
Look at that beautiful color.

32:26.510 --> 32:29.113
Nice.
Wow.

32:29.180 --> 32:31.215
- Beautiful.
- What do you think of the sign?

32:31.282 --> 32:32.211
I love it.
It looks great.

32:32.211 --> 32:32.516
I love it.
It looks great.

32:32.583 --> 32:34.585
It stands out.
It stands out.

32:34.652 --> 32:36.387
The first time
I drove past it,

32:36.454 --> 32:37.722
I couldn't even see
the logo.

32:37.788 --> 32:40.958
We can see it now!
Now it stands out.

32:41.025 --> 32:42.893
What do you think?
I love it.
I love this color.

32:42.960 --> 32:44.161
I love it.

32:44.228 --> 32:46.297
Good. Mwah!
Thank you.

32:46.364 --> 32:49.433
I haven't felt this good
in a long time.

32:49.500 --> 32:50.634
This is the fresh start
we've been waiting for.

32:50.735 --> 32:53.437
There's more good news.

32:53.504 --> 32:58.209
We have a menu
for every frickin' table.

32:58.275 --> 33:01.078
Yes?

33:01.145 --> 33:02.211
Now, gone are
the 75 items.

33:02.211 --> 33:04.648
Now, gone are
the 75 items.

33:04.715 --> 33:06.751
Yeah? Seriously.
I love this menu.

33:06.851 --> 33:09.086
It's nice, clear.

33:09.153 --> 33:11.322
We needed menus really bad.

33:11.389 --> 33:14.058
Oh, I'm really happy.

33:14.125 --> 33:17.495
Now, let's have a look
at the new menu.

33:17.561 --> 33:21.365
Classic American dishes
done brilliantly well.

33:21.432 --> 33:23.167
Got a wedge salad--
vibrant.

33:23.234 --> 33:25.770
Slider trio--
turkey, beef, and chicken.

33:25.836 --> 33:27.471
- Delicious, yeah?
- Yes, Chef.

33:27.538 --> 33:29.540
Turkey, Swiss club.
Wonderful.

33:29.607 --> 33:30.741
The Classic American burger--

33:30.808 --> 33:32.211
your burger, the bomb,
has gone. Yeah?

33:32.211 --> 33:35.579
your burger, the bomb,
has gone. Yeah?

33:35.646 --> 33:38.949
Hallelujah!

33:39.016 --> 33:41.986
Dom!

33:42.052 --> 33:43.687
I swear to God, who needs
a pig in the backyard

33:43.754 --> 33:46.424
when you got  Dom?
big, deep breath.

33:46.490 --> 33:48.859
Oh, great. Dom, save some
for the staff,

33:48.926 --> 33:50.294
will you, please, yeah?
uh-huh.

33:50.361 --> 33:52.196
- Okay, dig in.
- Oh, jeez.

33:52.263 --> 33:54.398
it's so good.
Mmm...

33:54.465 --> 33:57.234
Kev, if you can cook
all this like this,

33:57.301 --> 33:59.937
we won't have a problem.

34:00.004 --> 34:01.539
The menu is cool. It's exciting.
There's a lot of new stuff.

34:01.605 --> 34:02.211
It looked awesome,
and it tasted even better.

34:02.211 --> 34:04.308
It looked awesome,
and it tasted even better.

34:04.375 --> 34:06.777
Did you eat this?
Gotta try
the corndog here.

34:06.844 --> 34:09.413
I love the new menu.
It was easy. It was fresh.

34:09.480 --> 34:12.917
It was a lot of new things.
I'm excited.

34:12.983 --> 34:17.321
I just bit my tongue.
Oh, man!

34:17.388 --> 34:20.057
I just want to say something,
and I'm gonna cry.

34:20.124 --> 34:23.027
I can't help it.

34:24.862 --> 34:28.132
The last couple days
have been really rough.

34:28.199 --> 34:30.835
But we pulled through it.

34:30.901 --> 34:32.211
And I know...

34:32.211 --> 34:34.071
And I know...

34:34.138 --> 34:37.107
You have to lead
by example.

34:37.174 --> 34:40.311
And somewhere along the line,
we got lost.

34:40.377 --> 34:43.280
And I just want to apologize
for that

34:43.347 --> 34:45.316
and say, you know,

34:45.382 --> 34:49.487
I've gotten a lot of clarity
over the last couple days...

34:49.553 --> 34:50.921
and in order
for anything to work,

34:50.988 --> 34:52.389
you have to have a leader,

34:52.456 --> 34:54.525
and you have to have
a strong leader,

34:54.592 --> 34:57.461
because if you don't have
leadership,

34:57.528 --> 35:00.364
you can't function.

35:00.431 --> 35:02.211
We're family, but we have
a business to run, okay?

35:02.211 --> 35:05.402
We're family, but we have
a business to run, okay?

35:05.469 --> 35:08.939
So those two things
need to be separated.

35:09.006 --> 35:12.042
And we will,
I promise you,

35:12.109 --> 35:14.578
show you the leadership
that you need to do your job.

35:14.645 --> 35:16.814
Okay?

35:16.881 --> 35:18.682
It's the moment
I've been waiting for.

35:18.749 --> 35:20.784
It's a new beginning
for myself

35:20.851 --> 35:23.988
as an owner of a business,
first and foremost.

35:24.054 --> 35:26.524
I love everybody here.

35:26.590 --> 35:30.427
So from this point on,
we're good.

35:30.494 --> 35:31.996
Okay?

35:32.062 --> 35:32.211
I never saw Colleen
with that kind of energy.

35:32.211 --> 35:34.398
I never saw Colleen
with that kind of energy.

35:34.465 --> 35:37.201
It was a shock.
And it's a good feeling.

35:37.268 --> 35:39.136
I think I'm done
yelling at people.

35:39.203 --> 35:40.971
It's time for me
to change too.

35:44.208 --> 35:45.609
Chef Ramsay
handed this to us,

35:45.676 --> 35:47.811
and it's on our shoulders
to make this work.

35:47.878 --> 35:49.446
We're both gonna take
the reins,

35:49.513 --> 35:51.081
and we're gonna be in control
of this place again.

35:54.652 --> 35:57.121
Coming up, they may have
all the right tools...

35:57.187 --> 35:58.889
Diners are standing
in the dining room

35:58.956 --> 36:00.791
- waiting to be sat down.
- but will the staff...

36:00.858 --> 36:02.211
Are you smoking cigarettes
out there?

36:02.211 --> 36:02.293
Are you smoking cigarettes
out there?

36:02.359 --> 36:04.128
And the owners...
All over the place.

36:04.194 --> 36:06.664
- Come on, guys!
- Make this relaunch a success...

36:06.730 --> 36:08.399
You got to keep on
driving.

36:08.465 --> 36:10.034
Or a disappointing disaster?
Get out there!

36:10.100 --> 36:12.670
That's next
on Kitchen Nightmares.

36:20.302 --> 36:23.639
Inspired by the new decor
and the upgraded menu,

36:23.705 --> 36:26.375
the staff is eager to get ready
for the grand reopening.

36:26.442 --> 36:28.110
Let's have some fun
tonight, guys.

36:28.177 --> 36:30.012
You know it.

36:30.079 --> 36:32.448
The owners have decided
to split responsibilities,

36:32.514 --> 36:35.050
with Naomi taking control
of the kitchen...

36:35.117 --> 36:37.553
You want to cut your rolls?
I guess I could
cut some, right?

36:37.619 --> 36:39.755
And Colleen leading the staff
in the dining room.

36:39.822 --> 36:41.857
You need something,

36:41.924 --> 36:43.559
take a deep breath,
ask for help.

36:43.625 --> 36:45.306
Okay?
Everybody good?

36:45.306 --> 36:46.128
Okay?
Everybody good?

36:46.195 --> 36:50.566
Yay!
All right, let's go.

36:50.632 --> 36:52.668
Opening in five minutes,
guys, yes?

36:52.735 --> 36:54.570
Kevin, you ready?
Good man.
Ready.

36:54.636 --> 36:56.238
I cannot wait
for that first order

36:56.305 --> 36:57.706
to come through
on that machine.

36:57.773 --> 37:00.209
I need to smoke
before we do this.
Yeah.

37:00.275 --> 37:01.643
Tonight is a very big night,
I feel.

37:01.710 --> 37:04.113
And I'm a little nervous.

37:04.179 --> 37:05.681
Dude, you got a lighter?
Yeah.

37:07.616 --> 37:09.151
Hey, guys, there's people
at the front door.

37:09.218 --> 37:10.219
There's nobody here
to greet them.

37:10.285 --> 37:11.887
Come on!
Where are the girls?

37:11.954 --> 37:14.790
- Oh, not now.
- . Ladies!

37:14.857 --> 37:15.306
Where's--where's Ashleigh?
Get out there!

37:15.306 --> 37:18.594
Where's--where's Ashleigh?
Get out there!

37:18.660 --> 37:20.095
No.
Yes!

37:20.162 --> 37:22.598
Are you smoking cigarettes
out there?

37:22.664 --> 37:24.967
Look at me. No, stop.
Are you smoking cigarettes?

37:25.033 --> 37:26.468
We were. We didn't.
Okay, well,
let me tell you something.

37:26.535 --> 37:28.537
Let me tell you something
really important.

37:28.604 --> 37:30.272
Diners are standing
in the dining room

37:30.339 --> 37:31.940
waiting to be sat down.
Okay.

37:32.007 --> 37:33.242
And look at the time.

37:33.308 --> 37:35.511
We opened up five minutes ago.
Come on, guys!

37:35.577 --> 37:38.247
They didn't ask anybody if they
could take a smoke break.

37:38.313 --> 37:40.215
They know that service
is about to begin.

37:40.282 --> 37:41.917
They should have been ready.

37:41.984 --> 37:43.752
With the restaurant
quickly filling up...

37:43.819 --> 37:45.306
Your server
will be over shortly.

37:45.306 --> 37:45.521
Your server
will be over shortly.

37:45.587 --> 37:47.523
The waitresses rush
to redeem themselves.

37:47.589 --> 37:49.458
Did we see any delicious
appetizers we want?

37:49.525 --> 37:51.426
Can I get you something
to drink to start?

37:51.493 --> 37:54.029
And Chef Ramsay looks
to the owners

37:54.096 --> 37:55.964
to finally provide
the much-needed leadership

37:56.031 --> 37:57.399
at Classic American.

37:57.466 --> 37:59.434
Naomi, I need a leader.
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

37:59.501 --> 38:00.836
Cooking and talking
at the same time

38:00.903 --> 38:02.304
is the hardest thing
in the world to do.

38:02.371 --> 38:03.772
When you get it right,
it's harmony.

38:03.839 --> 38:05.340
Yeah? I want to hear it
tonight, okay?

38:05.440 --> 38:07.709
Colleen and I had always
just blended in,

38:07.776 --> 38:09.611
but it's time
to stand out now.

38:09.678 --> 38:12.014
And it's on our shoulders
to make this work.

38:12.080 --> 38:15.306
Herbie, you're up--I need a Mac
and cheese bite and a corndog.

38:15.306 --> 38:15.350
Herbie, you're up--I need a Mac
and cheese bite and a corndog.

38:15.417 --> 38:17.286
Kevin, you got
a classic burger.

38:17.352 --> 38:18.554
Two orders of wings
all day.

38:18.620 --> 38:20.255
Got the wings. Yeah.

38:20.322 --> 38:22.224
Excellent. Nice.
Keep it going guys, yes?

38:22.291 --> 38:23.525
Yeah.
Yes!

38:23.592 --> 38:25.527
Naomi's newfound confidence

38:25.594 --> 38:27.663
- has the kitchen humming...
- Let's get it going!

38:27.729 --> 38:29.932
Order up.
Ashleigh, table eight.
Thank you.

38:29.998 --> 38:32.634
And orders are flying
out of the kitchen.

38:32.701 --> 38:36.038
Meanwhile...
Welcome. My name is Colleen.
I'm one of the owners.

38:36.104 --> 38:39.641
Colleen has stepped up
in her role as floor manager.

38:39.708 --> 38:41.677
Table six is adding
a shrimp appetizer.

38:41.743 --> 38:43.445
Oh, the ladies--
my table.
Yes.

38:43.512 --> 38:45.247
But their food is
already in,

38:45.314 --> 38:46.748
so you have to let
the kitchen know.
Okay.

38:46.815 --> 38:49.518
It was really good
to see Colleen actually step up

38:49.585 --> 38:51.753
and tell us what to do
and be the leader.

38:51.854 --> 38:53.388
Take the meatloaf out.

38:53.455 --> 38:55.090
Pulled pork right away.
Let's go.

38:59.661 --> 39:01.864
Surprisingly, we got
off to a good start--

39:01.930 --> 39:03.298
I mean, a really good start,
but based on the performance

39:03.365 --> 39:05.067
of this kitchen
over the last ten years,

39:05.133 --> 39:06.869
I'm not holding out...

39:06.935 --> 39:09.404
Not yet.

39:09.471 --> 39:11.974
All right, Kevin, turkey burger
with onion rings.

39:12.040 --> 39:14.076
Just put it up.

39:16.979 --> 39:20.048
Guys...Guys, look!.

39:20.148 --> 39:21.817
I'm not gonna send it with
that  underneath there.

39:21.884 --> 39:24.253
You bust your ass like that
to create fantastic food.

39:24.319 --> 39:25.520
You don't serve it
onto  plates

39:25.587 --> 39:27.956
With crap underneath.
Look, all over the place.

39:28.023 --> 39:29.658
Come on.
I cannot afford

39:29.725 --> 39:31.793
for you to take your eye
off the ball now, please.

39:31.894 --> 39:33.328
See that?

39:33.395 --> 39:35.898
I was nervous, and I was trying
to get in the zone.

39:35.964 --> 39:37.132
This is where all the mistakes
start to happen.

39:37.232 --> 39:38.800
You got to keep on
driving, yeah?

39:38.867 --> 39:39.768
Yes.
Come on, keep it going.

39:39.835 --> 39:41.303
We'll all pull together,

39:41.370 --> 39:43.071
and we'll all step up,
and we'll get past it.

39:43.138 --> 39:44.840
Just watch the bottom
of the plates for me.

39:44.907 --> 39:45.306
There's nowhere else
to move but forward.

39:45.306 --> 39:46.608
There's nowhere else
to move but forward.

39:46.675 --> 39:48.477
There you go. Excellent.

39:48.543 --> 39:50.445
Table nine.

39:50.512 --> 39:52.481
After looking
after a small hiccup,

39:52.547 --> 39:55.550
This kitchen, led by Naomi,
is back in its groove...

39:55.617 --> 39:57.986
How is everything?
Excellent.

39:58.053 --> 39:59.721
Good? You like it?
Good choice?

39:59.788 --> 40:01.823
And delivering
high-quality dishes

40:01.890 --> 40:03.825
that are striking a chord
with customers.

40:03.892 --> 40:05.093
How do we like everything?

40:05.160 --> 40:07.262
Absolutely delicious.
I'm glad.

40:07.329 --> 40:10.265
We'll come back for more,
trust me.
All right. Okay.

40:10.332 --> 40:12.768
As dinner winds down

40:12.834 --> 40:14.937
and happy customers
leave the restaurant...

40:15.003 --> 40:15.306
Thank you.
See you later. Bye.

40:15.306 --> 40:17.306
Thank you.
See you later. Bye.

40:17.372 --> 40:19.841
It is clear
that these two owners,

40:19.908 --> 40:21.376
under the guidance
of Chef Ramsay...

40:21.443 --> 40:23.245
Stay together, guys.
Stay together.

40:23.312 --> 40:25.514
Have just made
the greatest comeback

40:25.580 --> 40:27.416
in Kitchen Nightmares
history.

40:27.482 --> 40:29.484
How we doing, guys?

40:29.551 --> 40:32.087
- Where are all the tickets?
- Yeah, we cleared the board.

40:32.154 --> 40:34.089
Colleen, the place is full.
The board's clear.

40:34.156 --> 40:36.325
Customers are happy. Yeah?
Come on, keep it going.

40:36.391 --> 40:38.460
Behind everybody,
all the way.

40:38.527 --> 40:41.396
Watching the customers
enjoying what they were eating,

40:41.463 --> 40:42.731
that's what you're here for.

40:42.798 --> 40:45.306
That's why you bust your ass,
you know?

40:45.306 --> 40:45.467
That's why you bust your ass,
you know?

40:45.534 --> 40:48.704
From this point on,
it's a new beginning.

40:48.770 --> 40:51.807
Good night.
Thank you very much.

40:55.544 --> 40:57.145
Okay, let's be honest,

40:57.212 --> 41:02.084
this has been a very difficult
turnaround, yeah?

41:02.150 --> 41:06.154
But you all pulled off
a fantastic service.

41:06.221 --> 41:10.559
Congratulations!
Amazing!
Thank you.

41:10.625 --> 41:12.494
Colleen, how's it feel?
It felt great.

41:12.561 --> 41:15.306
I'm proud of each
and every one of them.

41:15.306 --> 41:15.364
I'm proud of each
and every one of them.

41:15.430 --> 41:16.665
Everybody worked hard.
Yeah.

41:16.765 --> 41:20.102
And, Naomi, hearing your voice
calling, commanding,

41:20.168 --> 41:22.738
assertive
is really important,

41:22.804 --> 41:24.473
because it just puts
that discipline

41:24.539 --> 41:26.375
across the line.

41:26.441 --> 41:28.510
And more importantly,
you're good at it.

41:28.577 --> 41:34.016
Colleen, Naomi, this restaurant
has every potential

41:34.082 --> 41:38.420
to really seriously
become a huge success.

41:38.487 --> 41:41.256
Do not start dropping
your standard.

41:41.323 --> 41:43.225
It means too much.
Okay.

41:43.291 --> 41:45.306
Well done.
Well done.
Thanks, chef.

41:45.306 --> 41:46.261
Well done.
Well done.
Thanks, chef.

41:46.328 --> 41:48.063
Thank you.
Well done.
Well done.

41:48.130 --> 41:50.065
Come here, you.
Well done.

41:50.165 --> 41:52.634
Oh--ohh...
Well done. Mmm!

41:52.701 --> 41:55.871
I want to thank Chef Ramsay
for giving us this opportunity

41:55.937 --> 41:58.373
to start all over again--
it's a dream come true.

41:58.440 --> 42:00.842
You're on your way.
Good night.
Good night.

42:06.615 --> 42:07.949
There's only one word
to describe

42:08.016 --> 42:09.384
what happened here tonight,

42:09.451 --> 42:11.486
and that's a "miracle."

42:11.553 --> 42:13.755
I only hope that
these two former waitresses

42:13.822 --> 42:15.306
can finally achieve
their classic American dream.

42:15.306 --> 42:17.192
can finally achieve
their classic American dream.

42:17.259 --> 42:20.729
Jeez, 50 seats, 13 menus.

42:20.796 --> 42:23.698
me.

42:27.269 --> 42:29.271
After Chef Ramsay left,

42:29.337 --> 42:32.040
Colleen and Naomi continued
to run Classic American

42:32.107 --> 42:33.241
like a well-oiled machine.

42:33.308 --> 42:34.843
Kevin, you need
two chickens on.

42:34.910 --> 42:36.311
Dom, maybe you should jump

42:36.378 --> 42:38.246
on dishes
for a little bit.
All right.

42:38.313 --> 42:41.149
The owners also implemented
a loyalty system

42:41.216 --> 42:43.385
to reward repeat customers.

42:43.452 --> 42:45.087
These are
punch cards, okay?

42:45.153 --> 42:45.306
At the end,
you get your meal free.

42:45.306 --> 42:48.223
At the end,
you get your meal free.

42:48.290 --> 42:50.292
Since then,
the staff is happy.

42:50.358 --> 42:52.227
I love this computer.
I love it.
Mm-hmm.

42:52.294 --> 42:53.962
Business is booming...

42:54.029 --> 42:55.597
We will be back,
I guarantee that.

42:55.664 --> 42:57.332
And Classic American
looks poised

42:57.399 --> 42:59.801
to become a classic success.

42:59.868 --> 43:02.304
I feel alive,
and it feels good

43:02.370 --> 43:04.072
to finally be able
to smile again.

43:04.139 --> 43:05.974
It's a new beginning.
