00:01.630 --> 00:02.879
Look at her go, Remy!

00:02.880 --> 00:05.589
Swift, majestic, unsinkable!

00:05.590 --> 00:08.169
Oh, it sank.
RIP, tiny sailors.

00:08.170 --> 00:10.300
Hey, Cricket, look at that!

00:11.630 --> 00:14.589
Huh? Why are people
throwin' their money away?

00:14.590 --> 00:17.419
Wow, I didn't know money
came in coin form!

00:17.420 --> 00:19.589
Gee, how much do you think
is in there, Cricket?

00:19.590 --> 00:22.629
I don't know,
but I'm about to find out!

00:22.630 --> 00:25.509
- I'm swimmin' in moolah!
- [officer] Halt, child!

00:25.510 --> 00:28.009
You can't take these coins.
You'd be stealing wishes.

00:28.010 --> 00:29.509
Wishes? Explain yourself.

00:29.510 --> 00:32.709
Well, people toss money
in fountains and make a wish.

00:32.710 --> 00:34.549
I always make the same wish.

00:34.550 --> 00:36.419
I wish I could fly.

00:36.420 --> 00:38.549
Do the wishes ever come true?

00:38.550 --> 00:41.379
- Not yet, but here's hoping.
- But who keeps the money?

00:41.380 --> 00:43.459
Yeah, answer the question,
lawman!

00:43.460 --> 00:46.049
Hm, I suppose
whoever owns the fountain.

00:46.050 --> 00:47.419
Sounds like
a pretty good racket.

00:47.420 --> 00:50.589
Yeah, I bet that person is rich!

00:50.590 --> 00:52.669
[echoing] Rich... rich...

00:52.670 --> 00:54.009
Bingo-bango.

00:54.010 --> 00:55.799
Sorry Remy! I gotta go!

00:55.800 --> 00:58.459
Okay, cool! I guess, um...

00:58.460 --> 01:00.589
I'll just go home too, then.

01:00.590 --> 01:03.839
Come one, come all! Your
wildest dreams will come true

01:03.840 --> 01:07.509
once you visit Cricket's
wonderful Well-O-Wishin'!

01:07.510 --> 01:10.959
- [snorting]
- Ah! Here's
some well-wishers now!

01:10.960 --> 01:14.629
Step right up and make a wish!
The more you spend,
the bigger the wish!

01:14.630 --> 01:18.589
-Okay!
-Oh, no, no, sweetie.
That's where wishes go to die.

01:18.590 --> 01:21.589
- Aw, come on! Take a chance!
- I don't think so.

01:21.590 --> 01:24.169
- Nah, brah.
- [snorting]

01:24.170 --> 01:28.379
You too, pig? Hm. This business
venture may be a lost cause.

01:28.380 --> 01:30.170
- [splashing]
- Huh?

01:31.960 --> 01:33.549
Whoa, whoa, Tilly.
What're you doing?

01:33.550 --> 01:34.749
I'm making a wish.

01:34.750 --> 01:36.299
And I figured if your
wishing well

01:36.300 --> 01:38.459
is even half as magical
as you say it is,

01:38.460 --> 01:40.919
then my wish
is sure to come true.

01:40.920 --> 01:43.879
- Is that all your money?
- [laughs] Of course not.

01:43.880 --> 01:46.509
There. That's all my money.

01:46.510 --> 01:48.879
Now, to wait
for my wish to be granted.

01:48.880 --> 01:53.589
- [humming tune]
- I'm rich! I'm rich!

01:53.590 --> 01:55.459
With Tilly's money.

01:55.460 --> 01:58.629
I don't normally like to do
this, but I gotta ask myself,

01:58.630 --> 02:03.509
what's the right thing to do?
[straining]

02:03.510 --> 02:05.839
- Take the dang money, man!
- Hm?

02:05.840 --> 02:08.209
- Hiya!
- Ah! A devil! A devil!

02:08.210 --> 02:10.049
Return from whence you came!

02:10.050 --> 02:12.959
Whoa! Calm down, buddy.
I'm just a friend.

02:12.960 --> 02:15.549
Friend? But you look
like a dadgum devil!

02:15.550 --> 02:17.249
Oh, these are just my jammies.

02:17.250 --> 02:20.049
I'm here because you needed help
making the right decision.

02:20.050 --> 02:22.459
Oh, well, that's good.
I could use some guidance.

02:22.460 --> 02:24.509
Say, isn't there supposed
to be a little angel fella?

02:24.510 --> 02:27.129
Ba-ba-ba-ba!
Focus on the here and now.

02:27.130 --> 02:30.129
Concerning Tilly's money,
it's perfectly fine for you
to keep it.

02:30.130 --> 02:34.249
- After all, she gave it to you.
- What you're saying
certainly makes sense.

02:34.250 --> 02:37.049
I know! Don't over-think
this one, big guy.

02:37.050 --> 02:40.459
- You earned it.
- [laughs] I did, didn't I?

02:40.460 --> 02:44.379
Now, what can
two handsome devils do
with this newfound fortune?

02:44.380 --> 02:46.750
[both] Mm!

02:50.630 --> 02:54.380
- [bell ringing]
- [video game beeping]

03:07.630 --> 03:10.509
Hey, y'all!
Wish me happy birthday!

03:10.510 --> 03:15.459
- [all] Happy birthday!
- It's not even my birthday!

03:15.460 --> 03:18.509
- Cricket! Cricket!
- Kid, you're on a roll.

03:18.510 --> 03:20.959
[devil] Betcha can't throw
two balls at once.

03:20.960 --> 03:23.459
Ha, watch and learn,
little guy! [grunting]

03:23.460 --> 03:25.959
- Cricket Green, how could you!
- Ah!

03:25.960 --> 03:28.459
- [laughs, grunts]
- Ah! It felt like someone

03:28.460 --> 03:31.629
- just shouted right in my ear!
- [screams]

03:31.630 --> 03:35.459
- Uh...
- [choral music stops and starts]

03:35.460 --> 03:37.249
- [gasping]
- Ah!

03:37.250 --> 03:40.009
[grunting] I never
thought I'd make it out!

03:40.010 --> 03:42.629
- [crashing]
- Uh, what just crawled
outta my body?

03:42.630 --> 03:46.299
I did! Come on, seriously?
It's hard wearing white.

03:46.300 --> 03:48.799
Oh, great, here comes
King of the Killjoys.

03:48.800 --> 03:52.419
Cricket Green,
I can't believe you swindled
your dear, sweet sister!

03:52.420 --> 03:54.709
That was like two hours ago.
Why didn't you show up then?

03:54.710 --> 03:57.669
Ha! I would have
if somebody hadn't hogtied me

03:57.670 --> 04:02.459
- and left me for the dogs!
- [slurping] Mmm...

04:02.460 --> 04:05.589
Anyway, scamming your sister
is the lowest of the low.

04:05.590 --> 04:07.549
However, it's not too
late for you, Cricket.

04:07.550 --> 04:10.129
You can still return the money,
and all will be forgiven.

04:10.130 --> 04:13.209
Eh, that might be hard to do.
I've only got one quarter left.

04:13.210 --> 04:17.549
Well, I suppose one quarter
is a start... Wait,
what're you doing?

04:17.550 --> 04:20.419
- No, Cricket, no!
- [chewing] Yay!

04:20.420 --> 04:23.419
- [stammering] Ah!
- [laughs] That's my boy.

04:23.420 --> 04:27.549
You're a monster! And you!
You're on your way
to becoming a monster!

04:27.550 --> 04:32.509
-Oh! Come on!
-Take heed, Cricket Green.
Is this really who you wanna be?

04:32.510 --> 04:34.339
If you don't make things
right with your sister,

04:34.340 --> 04:36.709
I'm gonna annoy you
till the end of time!

04:36.710 --> 04:38.799
I'll pull your toes
when you're trying to sleep!

04:38.800 --> 04:41.549
I'll chew on yer ears!
And I'll make weird noises!

04:41.550 --> 04:45.419
[babbling]
And I'll punch your butt!

04:45.420 --> 04:49.209
Hey, that's my personal area.
You're really getting
on my nerves!

04:49.210 --> 04:52.589
Well, you want me to leave, huh?
Then earn back Tilly's money,

04:52.590 --> 04:56.629
and I'll be gone lickety-split.
Now, get to work
filling this jar!

04:56.630 --> 04:58.209
[groans] Fine!

04:58.210 --> 05:00.960
[music plays]

05:16.380 --> 05:19.299
- All right!
- Half full! Time for a break!

05:19.300 --> 05:21.590
No, half empty.
Get back to work!

05:41.420 --> 05:44.589
It seems the fountain
has absorbed my coins.

05:44.590 --> 05:47.629
Which means the time is nigh
for my wish to come true.

05:47.630 --> 05:51.419
All right, Angel.
When I give Tilly's money back,
you're outta here, right?

05:51.420 --> 05:54.549
Once you've righted your wrongs,
I say adios.

05:54.550 --> 05:56.419
That's all I needed to hear.

05:56.420 --> 05:58.419
Hey, Tilly.
Uh, here's your money back.

05:58.420 --> 06:00.919
I figured you could use it
for something more worthwhile.

06:00.920 --> 06:03.879
This time don't spend it
all in one place, you hear?
[laughs]

06:03.880 --> 06:07.589
Ah! Done and done!
Goodbye, annoying angel.

06:07.590 --> 06:11.459
- [coins rattling]
- Uh, Tilly? Didn't you
hear what I just said?

06:11.460 --> 06:15.799
Yes, I did. But I can't
think of anything better
I'd like to buy than a wish.

06:15.800 --> 06:18.959
Okay, Tilly.
I gotta come clean.

06:18.960 --> 06:22.459
- What is it, Cricket?
- Actually, you might
find this a little funny.

06:22.460 --> 06:25.459
[laughs] Yeah, I think you'll be
laughing when you hear this one.

06:25.460 --> 06:29.669
- Sounds pretty good. [laughs]
- [both laugh]

06:29.670 --> 06:34.959
The fountain is a scam!
I did it to make some
quick money! [laughs]

06:34.960 --> 06:37.879
I fail to see
the humor, brother.

06:37.880 --> 06:41.509
So where does this leave
the status of my requested wish?

06:41.510 --> 06:45.169
Well, Tilly,
your wish ain't coming true.

06:45.170 --> 06:48.459
Uh, but maybe it'll
come true on its own!
What'd you wish for?

06:48.460 --> 06:51.299
I wished that
I could touch a rainbow.

06:51.300 --> 06:55.629
Okay. Cool, cool, cool, cool.
Cool.

06:55.630 --> 07:00.799
I wished, if only for a second,
to be a part of nature's
most fleeting beauty.

07:00.800 --> 07:04.509
Everyone has seen a rainbow.
But I wanted to touch one.

07:04.510 --> 07:07.339
To feel it.
Is it warm or chilly?

07:07.340 --> 07:11.709
Soft or surprisingly coarse?
I guess I'll never know.

07:11.710 --> 07:14.509
- Hey, you forgot your money!
- Keep it.

07:14.510 --> 07:18.419
Money's nothing compared
to the promise of a wish.

07:18.420 --> 07:20.799
Wow. Just wow.

07:20.800 --> 07:22.669
I hope you're proud of yourself!

07:22.670 --> 07:25.089
You again? I thought
I got rid of you.

07:25.090 --> 07:26.839
- Yeah! What the heck, dude?
- Oh, hey, buddy.

07:26.840 --> 07:28.669
- Wassup?
- Well, Cricket.

07:28.670 --> 07:31.089
I said I'd leave you alone once
you made things right.

07:31.090 --> 07:33.009
And things are far from right!

07:33.010 --> 07:34.589
Eh! He tried his best.

07:34.590 --> 07:36.629
Did you see the look
on Tilly's face?

07:36.630 --> 07:39.509
She can't get any sadder.
He should just keep the money.

07:39.510 --> 07:42.009
- [gasps] No, he should not!
- Yes, he should!

07:42.010 --> 07:45.589
-No, he shouldn't!
-Guys, quiet down!
I can't hear myself think!

07:45.590 --> 07:47.919
- Cricket, listen to me.
- No, listen to me!

07:47.920 --> 07:52.129
I said be quiet! [sighs]
That's better.

07:52.130 --> 07:56.049
Cricket! Don't listen to him!
I'm trying to help you!

07:56.050 --> 07:58.709
Ha! Time to shut you up
for good!

07:58.710 --> 08:01.249
- [grunting] That doesn't
feel good.
- [zapping]

08:01.250 --> 08:03.509
- This time it's gonna be my way!
- Ah!

08:03.510 --> 08:06.709
[grunting] It's dark!
Who turned off the sun?!

08:06.710 --> 08:09.959
- Take that and that and that!
- [zapping]

08:09.960 --> 08:14.629
When in disgrace with fortune
and men's eyes, I, all alone,
beweep my outcast state.

08:14.630 --> 08:20.459
Come back here, you! Huh?
Come out, come out,
wherever you are! Ah!

08:20.460 --> 08:23.299
♪ Oh, never forgetty
to eat your spaghetti ♪

08:23.300 --> 08:25.549
♪ And you'll be

08:25.550 --> 08:29.049
- Here, have a light!
- Ah! Hot, hot, hot!

08:29.050 --> 08:33.549
Well, well, well.
Ain't this a glorious sight.

08:33.550 --> 08:35.589
How the righteous have fallen.

08:35.590 --> 08:38.049
Cricket! I know we
don't get along great,

08:38.050 --> 08:42.549
but you shouldn't do the
right thing to get rid of me!

08:42.550 --> 08:45.049
- Hey! Let go!
- You should do it
for your sister!

08:45.050 --> 08:48.339
[both shouting]

08:48.340 --> 08:51.669
[gasps] Angel's right!
Tried to escape my own guilt.

08:51.670 --> 08:55.339
Forgot about Tilly's feelings!
I gotta make this right.
Tilly deserves it!

08:55.340 --> 08:59.249
[sighs] Have you ever
had a wish, ladybug?

08:59.250 --> 09:02.049
Well, you should give up on it.
Take it from me,

09:02.050 --> 09:06.669
a washed up old hag with a wish
and nothing to show for it.

09:06.670 --> 09:08.379
- [Cricket] Tilly!
- What now?

09:08.380 --> 09:10.709
I had to make a choice today
about who I am.

09:10.710 --> 09:13.459
And cheatin' you, well,
that's not who I wanna be.

09:13.460 --> 09:17.249
-This is who I wanna be!
[panting]
-Cricket, what are you doing?

09:17.250 --> 09:19.799
- Hey! Get outta that fountain!
- Ah!

09:19.800 --> 09:23.459
- [grunting]
- Get back here, please!

09:23.460 --> 09:25.589
[Cricket panting]

09:25.590 --> 09:28.509
- What is he doing?
- Officer Keys, wait!

09:28.510 --> 09:30.629
- Oh, yes?
- Make a wish.

09:30.630 --> 09:31.919
Oh, joy!

09:31.920 --> 09:34.299
I wish I could fly!

09:34.300 --> 09:37.709
- Huh? Aw!
- [laughs]

09:37.710 --> 09:40.879
- Cricket, I don't understand!
- [rumbling]

09:40.880 --> 09:43.549
Tilly Green, I'm gonna
make your wish come true!

09:43.550 --> 09:47.709
[shouting]

09:47.710 --> 09:51.009
- Wow!
- [grunting]

09:51.010 --> 09:54.919
- Oof!
- I'm doing it, Ma! I'm flying!

09:54.920 --> 09:58.509
- Oof!

09:58.510 --> 10:01.709

10:01.710 --> 10:06.959
It's... it's
everything I ever dreamed!

10:06.960 --> 10:10.629
[gasping, coughing, groans]
Huh?

10:10.630 --> 10:13.420
That was the nicest thing
you ever did for me.

10:14.510 --> 10:15.959
Glad you liked it, Tilly.

10:15.960 --> 10:18.589
That wish was worth every penny.

10:18.590 --> 10:20.919
And nickel and dime and quarter.

10:20.920 --> 10:23.009
Well, looks like
our job here is done.

10:23.010 --> 10:25.379
- Till next time, eh?
- Till next time.
