21:48.930 --> 21:52.434
>> LOOK, UM...MONICA, IM SORRY.

21:52.440 --> 21:56.638
>> NO, IM SORRY, DR. MCNAMARA.

21:56.640 --> 21:58.779
I HAVE TO STOP DOING THIS.

21:58.780 --> 22:01.783
>> YOUVE DONE IT BEFORE?

22:01.790 --> 22:03.314
>> JUST ONCE. WITH A FATHER

22:03.320 --> 22:05.413
I WORKED WITH IN AKRON. THAT

22:05.420 --> 22:06.444
WAS AFTER I WORKED FOR THEM

22:06.450 --> 22:08.839
FOR, LIKE, 2 YEARS, AND HIS WIFE

22:08.850 --> 22:11.398
WAS A TOTAL BITCH.

22:11.400 --> 22:15.723
NOT LIKE YOUR WIFE.

22:15.730 --> 22:17.095
IVE JUST BEEN SO LONELY SINCE

22:17.100 --> 22:19.728
I MOVED HERE. AND I KNOW,

22:19.730 --> 22:23.962
ITS SILLY, BUT I MISS HIM.

22:23.970 --> 22:26.404
AND YOU KIND OF REMIND ME

22:26.410 --> 22:27.866
OF HIM.

22:34.680 --> 22:35.647
>> I DONT THINK IT WOULD BE

22:35.650 --> 22:36.639
APPROPRIATE FOR YOU TO WORK

22:36.650 --> 22:37.844
FOR US, MONICA.

22:45.790 --> 22:46.984
> > I UNDERSTAND.

22:51.800 --> 22:55.736
SCREW YOU, MONICA.

22:55.740 --> 22:56.638
EVERY TIME YOU GET CLOSE TO

22:56.640 --> 22:57.698
SOMETHING PERFECT, YOU HAVE TO

22:57.700 --> 23:00.976
RUIN EVERYTHING.

23:00.980 --> 23:03.869
RANDALL, THE DAD FROM AKRON,

23:03.880 --> 23:06.144
HE USED TO TELL ME I MADE LOVE

23:06.150 --> 23:09.142
LIKE AN UGLY GIRL. GRATEFUL

23:09.150 --> 23:11.015
FOR WHATEVER I COULD GET.

23:15.660 --> 23:17.855
I NEED TO GO. CAN YOU TAKE ME

23:17.860 --> 23:19.009
HOME NOW?

23:29.670 --> 23:32.104
WHATS THE POINT, RIGHT?

23:32.110 --> 23:34.078
LIPSTICK ON A PIG.

23:40.040 --> 23:41.712
THATS WHAT RANDALL USED TO SAY.

23:47.920 --> 23:48.887
>> WHY DONT YOU LET ME DO

23:48.890 --> 23:49.914
SOMETHING FOR YOU.

24:05.470 --> 24:06.437
>> I THOUGHT WE DIDNT HAVE

24:06.440 --> 24:07.964
ANYTHING UNTIL 10 OCLOCK?

24:07.970 --> 24:08.902
>> I THOUGHT YOU WERE MEETING

24:08.910 --> 24:10.002
WITH YOUR TRAINER THIS MORNING.

24:10.010 --> 24:11.113
>> SHE CANCELLED.

24:11.120 --> 24:12.974
FOOD POISONING. WHOS THIS?

24:12.980 --> 24:15.141
>> FAMILY FRIEND. DEVIATED

24:18.050 --> 24:19.642
>> NOBODY TELLS ME ANYTHING.

24:19.650 --> 24:20.651
I THOUGHT WE DIDNT HAVE SURGERY

24:20.660 --> 24:21.957
UNTIL 10:00.

24:21.960 --> 24:23.154
>> JUST A DEVIATED SEPTUM.

24:23.160 --> 24:24.081
NOTHING I CANT HANDLE ON

24:24.090 --> 24:25.125
MY OWN.

24:26.860 --> 24:28.225
>> ISNT THAT MONICA WILDER?

24:28.230 --> 24:30.152
Christian: WHOS MONICA WILDER?

24:30.160 --> 24:31.092
>> SHES THE NIGHT NURSE I

24:42.050 --> 24:43.005
SHE DIDNT REALLY HAVE ENOUGH

24:43.010 --> 24:44.102
EXPERIENCE.

24:50.820 --> 24:52.708
>> YOU PORKED HER.

24:52.720 --> 24:53.982
>> THIS GIRL CANT BREATHE

24:53.990 --> 24:55.719
DURING ALLERGY SEASON. HER NEEDS

24:55.720 --> 24:56.709
ARE TOTALLY DIFFERENT

24:56.720 --> 24:57.982
FROM YOURS. MALLET.

24:57.990 --> 24:58.957
>> THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THAT

25:00.020 --> 25:01.169
HYPOCRITE.

25:59.920 --> 26:00.921
>> WELL, THE BOYS NEED TO KNOW

26:00.930 --> 26:01.851
THAT WE CAN DO A LOT MORE THAN

26:01.860 --> 26:03.054

28:19.190 --> 28:21.294
STUFF TO MANAGE YOUR ANXIETY.

28:30.880 --> 28:32.029
THIS BABY IS COMING HOME TO

29:50.960 --> 29:52.257
MAYBE HE SHOULDVE JUST LAID

29:52.260 --> 29:53.784
OFF THE GUACAMOLE.

29:53.790 --> 29:54.950

30:12.310 --> 30:13.402
APPROPRIATE TO DISCUSS YOUR NEW

30:13.410 --> 30:15.401
JERK OFF MATERIAL OVER SURGERY.

30:15.410 --> 30:16.399
>> OH, I DIDNT MASTURBATE TO

30:58.880 --> 31:00.074
ENCOUNTER I HAD WITH AN OLD

31:03.990 --> 31:04.979
ENVIRONMENT WHERE I HAVE TO

31:04.990 --> 31:07.026
WORRY THAT EVERY CONTACT I HAVE

31:07.030 --> 31:08.088
WITH A WOMAN ENCOURAGES YOUR

31:08.090 --> 31:09.955
SEXUAL FANTASIES.

31:09.960 --> 31:12.064
>> I AM SORRY IF I OFFENDED YOU,

31:12.070 --> 31:13.469
AND MAYBE I WENT TOO FAR, BUT

31:13.470 --> 31:14.960
I KNOW WHAT I SAW.

>> WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED

31:17.940 --> 31:18.929
TO MEAN?

31:18.940 --> 31:19.964
>> IT MEANS THAT NOT EVERYONE

31:19.970 --> 31:22.973

31:27.980 --> 31:29.538
SHAME COST ME MY JOB.

31:29.550 --> 31:30.574
YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT HAVING A

31:30.580 --> 31:31.649
WOMAN RUN THIS PLACE WAS GONNA

31:31.660 --> 31:33.514
MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE, BUT WITH

YOU, ITS ALL ESPRESSO MACHINES

31:35.920 --> 31:37.615
AND FRESH CARPETING, MICHELLE.

>> MICHELLE, YOURE TAKING A

31:58.340 --> 31:59.477
TRIVIAL MISUNDERSTANDING AND

31:59.480 --> 32:00.629
TWISTING IT INTO A SUBSTANTIAL

32:00.640 --> 32:02.084
SITUATION.

32:02.090 --> 32:04.285
>> HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF I

32:05.620 --> 32:07.349
RUMORS ABOUT YOU AND CHRISTIAN

32:07.350 --> 32:08.419
BEING LOVERS?

32:08.420 --> 32:09.580

WHAT SHE SAW.

32:12.160 --> 32:13.058
>> AND YOURE SAYING YOU

32:13.060 --> 32:14.027
BELIEVE HER.

32:14.030 --> 32:15.019
>> LOOK, IT DOESNT MATTER WHAT

32:15.030 --> 32:16.019
I BELIEVE. WE ALL HAVE LIVES

32:16.030 --> 32:17.292
OUTSIDE OF THE OFFICE.

32:17.300 --> 32:18.699
>> YOURE PROVING MY POINT.
