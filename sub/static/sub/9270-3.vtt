00:30.860 --> 00:33.130
Oh, this is fun.

00:33.180 --> 00:35.610
I must say, Lady Felicia, I never
thought that the circus

00:35.660 --> 00:36.810
would be quite your thing.

00:36.860 --> 00:38.540
Oh, it has its attractions.

00:41.980 --> 00:45.500
Oh! Nicholas! Laura.

00:48.460 --> 00:50.570
I believe we have our
second meeting tomorrow.

00:50.620 --> 00:55.770
11 o'clock. Don't be late.
Father Brown has a baptism at 12.

00:55.820 --> 00:57.690
Any jitters yet?

00:57.740 --> 01:00.530
Only at the thought of tripping
over on the way down the aisle.

01:00.580 --> 01:02.490
She had a dream.

01:02.540 --> 01:04.090
A premonition.

01:04.140 --> 01:05.340
Laura!

01:07.100 --> 01:09.850
~ Laura! ~ Mr Smythe!

01:09.900 --> 01:10.890
How do you two...?

01:10.940 --> 01:14.130
Mr Smythe used to come to the cafe
when the circus was here last year.

01:14.180 --> 01:16.730
You and your friend...
Oh, what was his name?

01:16.780 --> 01:18.340
Mr Welkin.

01:22.220 --> 01:24.130
These aren't for me, are they?

01:24.180 --> 01:28.490
~ Laura, I've done it. I've made my
fortune. ~ You've what?

01:28.540 --> 01:29.780
And now I've come back to...

01:31.100 --> 01:34.330
.. in the hope that you'll
fulfil our agreement.

01:34.380 --> 01:36.460
~ What agreement?
~ For your hand...

01:37.460 --> 01:38.620
.. in marriage.

02:09.380 --> 02:11.490
Look, I circled it.

02:11.540 --> 02:13.130
"Hope's Promise."

02:13.180 --> 02:16.250
I couldn't believe it
when I saw it. Laura Hope.

02:16.300 --> 02:17.770
Hope's Promise.

02:17.820 --> 02:20.170
It was a sign.
Don't you think, Father?

02:20.220 --> 02:23.930
I put everything I had on her
and, bam, she won!

02:23.980 --> 02:26.290
Another sign! Â£100 in winnings.

02:26.340 --> 02:27.810
Hardly what I'd call a fortune.

02:27.860 --> 02:28.890
I heard that, hairdo.

02:28.940 --> 02:30.210
Laura, what's going on?

02:30.260 --> 02:33.530
~ Who's this? ~ I am her fian...
~ What you doing out here?

02:33.580 --> 02:36.690
~ None of your business.
~ It's completely unprofessional.

02:36.740 --> 02:39.530
The audience isn't
supposed to see us before a show.

02:39.580 --> 02:41.930
Backstage, now. Now!

02:41.980 --> 02:44.100
Meet me here after, please.

02:46.620 --> 02:48.340
Something you want to tell me?

02:50.940 --> 02:53.260
~ I... ~ Maybe... you should sit down.

02:54.940 --> 02:59.100
And tell us why Mr Smythe thinks
you've agreed to marry him.

03:00.660 --> 03:03.770
Because I... I did.

03:03.820 --> 03:06.570
~ You what? ~ And not just him.

03:06.620 --> 03:07.930
Mr Welkin, too.

03:07.980 --> 03:10.370
What on earth possessed you?

03:10.420 --> 03:12.380
Smythe and Welkin were regulars.

03:13.540 --> 03:15.860
They were funny,
always making me laugh.

03:17.100 --> 03:19.420
And I'll admit
I used to flirt a bit.

03:21.660 --> 03:24.450
~ Dead man's hand.
~ Are you sure you're not cheating?

03:24.500 --> 03:26.020
An honourable man like me?

03:27.780 --> 03:30.170
Anything else for my two
favourite customers?

03:30.220 --> 03:32.540
Actually, I've got
something for you...

03:33.980 --> 03:36.290
~ .. a leaving present. ~ You sweetheart!

03:36.340 --> 03:38.410
Do you have a suitor, my dear?

03:38.460 --> 03:39.810
Are you offering, Mr Welkin?

03:39.860 --> 03:43.570
~ If you'll do me the honour...
~ Me too. I'd make you a fine husband.

03:43.620 --> 03:46.130
~ You've already got a girlfriend.
~ Don't listen to him.

03:46.180 --> 03:47.810
You're the only one for me.

03:47.860 --> 03:51.330
It's not fair to ask me to
choose between you. I love you both.

03:51.380 --> 03:54.180
So, how are you to decide?
You can't marry us both.

03:55.340 --> 03:56.740
Hmm, that's a tough one.

03:58.460 --> 03:59.650
I tell you what,

03:59.700 --> 04:02.490
whichever one of you first
makes his fortune,

04:02.540 --> 04:04.220
that's the one I'll marry.

04:05.220 --> 04:07.210
Agreed?

04:07.260 --> 04:08.450
Agreed.

04:08.500 --> 04:10.250
Agreed.

04:10.300 --> 04:12.100
Well, that settles that, then!

04:18.779 --> 04:20.970
That is the most ludicrous thing
I have ever heard.

04:21.019 --> 04:24.810
~ Couldn't have been more
than a month after that, I met you.
~ You didn't think to tell me?

04:24.860 --> 04:26.810
I didn't think they'd take it
seriously.

04:26.860 --> 04:31.090
Men can be delusional... especially
when they're in love.

04:31.140 --> 04:34.490
I think our best course of action is
to talk to Misters Smythe and Welkin

04:34.540 --> 04:36.010
after the show

04:36.060 --> 04:39.210
and clear up the matter. Agreed?

04:39.260 --> 04:40.820
~ Agreed. ~ Yes.

04:49.220 --> 04:51.100
You and a girl like that?

04:52.540 --> 04:55.930
~ Meaning what?
~ Meaning she's... and you're...

04:55.980 --> 04:59.050
What, she's tall and I'm short,
is that what you're trying to say?

04:59.100 --> 05:01.810
Meaning she's pretty
and you're ugly.

05:01.860 --> 05:03.010
Feel better now?

05:03.060 --> 05:04.850
Well, she's agreed.

05:04.900 --> 05:06.410
Oh, is that so?

05:06.460 --> 05:09.170
~ What about Enid?
~ Things have gotten stale between us.

05:09.220 --> 05:11.570
What, so you're just going to
throw her aside?

05:11.620 --> 05:13.050
She's not the one.

05:13.100 --> 05:15.850
If she was, I'd know by now.

05:15.900 --> 05:18.610
I'll let her down gently.

05:18.660 --> 05:21.700
See this girl?
Happy to join the circus, is she?

05:22.900 --> 05:27.130
Wouldn't ask her to do that. After
today's performance, I'm leaving.

05:27.180 --> 05:30.090
~ Excuse me?! ~ I'm sorry, Marvin!
~ What about the double act?

05:30.140 --> 05:33.370
~ The heart wants what the heart...
~ Don't give me that!

05:33.420 --> 05:35.530
You've wanted out for years.

05:35.580 --> 05:37.330
Maybe I have.

05:37.380 --> 05:39.130
Maybe I've had enough of...

05:39.180 --> 05:44.130
~ prat-falls and custard pies in the
face! ~ This is a noble profession.

05:44.180 --> 05:47.650
Noble? I'm stuffing balloons
down my trousers!

05:47.700 --> 05:51.050
~ Making people laugh is the highest
call... ~ Calling there is.

05:51.100 --> 05:54.250
Yes, I know. Well, perhaps I've
found a higher calling -

05:54.300 --> 05:55.690
the beating of my heart.

05:55.740 --> 05:57.380
You make me sick!

06:02.940 --> 06:04.020
Marvin...

06:05.380 --> 06:06.700
What was that about?

06:08.260 --> 06:11.930
~ Disagreement over a custard pie.
~ What do you want for dinner tonight?

06:11.980 --> 06:13.860
Erm... Anything. Up to you.

06:16.100 --> 06:17.850
You all right?

06:17.900 --> 06:19.940
Yeah. See you later.

06:27.980 --> 06:30.930
Look, I've won.

06:30.980 --> 06:32.210
I've made my fortune.

06:32.260 --> 06:34.490
There's nothing you can do about it.

06:34.540 --> 06:35.780
Nothing?

06:37.820 --> 06:40.770
I thought you were
an honourable man.

06:40.820 --> 06:42.540
I'm going to slit your throat.

06:58.820 --> 07:00.660
Oh!

07:16.420 --> 07:18.140
CHEERING

07:40.060 --> 07:42.100
HE CRIES

07:44.900 --> 07:46.300
CHEERING

07:49.540 --> 07:55.610
And now, ladies and gentleman,
boys and girls...

07:55.660 --> 07:59.570
prepare yourselves for the master of
the dark arts,

07:59.620 --> 08:02.170
the purveyor
of forbidden magic,

08:02.220 --> 08:04.330
knower of secrets,

08:04.380 --> 08:09.010
the Grand Wizard Welkin!

08:09.060 --> 08:11.860
APPLAUSE

08:18.900 --> 08:22.850
There is nothing more precious
to the human psyche

08:22.900 --> 08:25.700
than the belief in free will.

08:28.540 --> 08:32.250
And yet, this belief
can be shattered,

08:32.299 --> 08:36.340
crushed, exposed as nothing more
than an illusion.

08:37.940 --> 08:42.059
To demonstrate this,
I shall need a volunteer.

08:46.660 --> 08:48.410
You...

08:48.460 --> 08:50.900
Come to me.

08:53.100 --> 08:56.730
Some encouragement, ladies and
gentleman, boys and girls!

08:56.780 --> 08:59.820
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

09:10.580 --> 09:12.490
What is your name?

09:12.540 --> 09:14.490
Laura.

09:14.540 --> 09:16.460
Are you afraid of pain, Laura?

09:18.340 --> 09:20.220
Of course you are. You're human.

09:21.980 --> 09:24.730
But today...

09:24.780 --> 09:27.010
you will feel no pain,

09:27.060 --> 09:28.140
none at all.

09:29.220 --> 09:30.580
Do you understand?

09:31.780 --> 09:32.820
Yes.

09:42.540 --> 09:46.650
WIND CHIMES TINKLE

09:46.700 --> 09:48.660
Look deep into the light.

09:51.780 --> 09:56.780
Lose yourself
in its shimmering... beauty.

10:01.580 --> 10:03.060
Relax.

10:11.300 --> 10:14.220
AUDIENCE GASPS

10:20.740 --> 10:22.460
Raise your arm.

10:25.700 --> 10:27.890
Place it into the fire.

10:27.940 --> 10:29.580
GASPS FROM CROWD

10:32.100 --> 10:33.420
Into the flame!

10:37.700 --> 10:39.340
How do you feel?

10:41.140 --> 10:43.620
I feel... fine.

10:52.340 --> 10:53.780
You will be mine.

11:12.420 --> 11:14.210
And you weren't scared?

11:14.260 --> 11:15.490
No.

11:15.540 --> 11:17.130
Explain that, Father.

11:17.180 --> 11:19.580
Never underestimate
the power of suggestion.

11:20.660 --> 11:22.890
You're shaking.

11:22.940 --> 11:24.650
What did he whisper in your ear?

11:24.700 --> 11:26.140
He said...

11:27.460 --> 11:29.210
"You will be mine."

11:29.260 --> 11:31.370
This has gone far enough!
When I get my hands...

11:31.420 --> 11:32.620
Try to stay calm.

11:34.660 --> 11:38.450
As soon as Mr Smythe gets here,
we'll get him to fetch Welkin.

11:38.500 --> 11:40.820
It's time we put
a stop to this nonsense.

12:00.220 --> 12:03.250
~ Going somewhere? ~ Er...

12:03.300 --> 12:05.050
Ow!

12:05.100 --> 12:07.340
Marvin told me everything.

12:15.380 --> 12:17.090
METALLIC SOUND OF KNIFE

12:17.140 --> 12:18.530
Hello?

12:18.580 --> 12:19.940
Someone there?

12:27.100 --> 12:28.690
Help!

12:28.740 --> 12:29.940
Help!

12:36.060 --> 12:38.220
Mr Smythe?!

12:46.100 --> 12:47.980
He tried to kill me.

13:00.140 --> 13:03.020
~ Tall, like some sort of spectre.
~ Evil eyes.

13:04.620 --> 13:07.170
Spectre with evil eyes?

13:07.220 --> 13:08.650
That about sums him up.

13:08.700 --> 13:10.170
Mr Welkin do that too?

13:10.220 --> 13:12.650
Er, no.

13:12.700 --> 13:14.010
That was someone else.

13:14.060 --> 13:15.250
Who?

13:15.300 --> 13:16.730
My ex-girlfriend.

13:16.780 --> 13:18.650
Looks like he's disappeared, sir.

13:18.700 --> 13:21.690
Witnesses reported seeing him
near the knife thrower's caravan

13:21.740 --> 13:23.410
shortly before the attack.

13:23.460 --> 13:25.050
Dust it for fingerprints.

13:25.100 --> 13:28.090
If he comes near you again,
report it immediately.

13:28.140 --> 13:29.530
That's it?

13:29.580 --> 13:31.220
What about some protection?

13:32.620 --> 13:35.210
We don't have
the resources for that...

13:35.260 --> 13:38.450
Inspector, I do think
Mr Welkin is dangerous.

13:38.500 --> 13:41.370
If he is prowling around
Kembleford...

13:41.420 --> 13:43.460
I'll conduct a brief search.

13:44.820 --> 13:48.770
If I were you,
I'd avoid being alone. Good day.

13:48.820 --> 13:52.290
Do you have a safe place to stay?

13:52.340 --> 13:54.770
I've got a B&B booked for tonight -

13:54.820 --> 13:56.570
a room for two.

13:56.620 --> 13:58.010
Look here, you little...

13:58.060 --> 13:59.570
Who are you calling "little"?!

13:59.620 --> 14:02.340
~ Mr Smythe... ~ Reggie, please.

14:03.660 --> 14:05.650
Let me do this properly.

14:05.700 --> 14:07.210
Oh, for Heaven's sake!

14:07.260 --> 14:10.330
Laura, from the moment
I first saw you,

14:10.380 --> 14:11.770
I knew you were the one...

14:11.820 --> 14:14.020
No, stop it!

14:15.300 --> 14:16.340
Mr Smythe...

14:21.140 --> 14:23.010
Reggie.

14:23.060 --> 14:25.970
When I offered my hand in
marriage...

14:26.020 --> 14:28.020
I meant it as nothing more
than a joke.

14:38.740 --> 14:42.020
THUNDER RUMBLES

14:46.180 --> 14:49.370
You don't have to stay with me,
Father. I'll be fine.

14:49.420 --> 14:52.810
Nonsense.
Broken hearts need company.

14:52.860 --> 14:55.450
I really don't think
it's safe for us

14:55.500 --> 14:58.730
to be in the same room
as a potential murder victim.

14:58.780 --> 15:00.940
Agreed. You should go.

15:01.940 --> 15:05.370
I'm not leaving you alone
with a madman on the loose.

15:05.420 --> 15:07.890
I suppose we could
have a nice cup of tea

15:07.940 --> 15:10.650
~ while we wait for the maniac
to arrive? ~ Grand.

15:10.700 --> 15:12.890
I've made a mess of everything.

15:12.940 --> 15:15.650
A great, big, stupid mess.

15:15.700 --> 15:17.330
Everyone makes mistakes.

15:17.380 --> 15:20.010
I don't need your platitudes,
Father.

15:20.060 --> 15:22.650
Please leave me alone,
both of you.

15:22.700 --> 15:24.890
I don't think
that will be a good idea.

15:24.940 --> 15:28.010
Until Mr Welkin is found,
it would be safer if...

15:28.060 --> 15:31.330
I'm not a child!
Stop treating me like one.

15:31.380 --> 15:32.780
Please, leave.

15:34.700 --> 15:37.010
We'll be downstairs.

15:37.060 --> 15:38.540
Call if you need us.

15:50.460 --> 15:53.250
A spectre with evil eyes. What next?

15:53.300 --> 15:55.250
Goblins? Witches?

15:55.300 --> 15:56.730
There's a storm coming.

15:56.780 --> 15:58.010
Oh, perfect!

15:58.060 --> 16:00.180
What's that? Stop the car!

16:06.220 --> 16:08.130
One snigger out of you...

16:08.180 --> 16:09.620
Not a peep, sir.

16:15.980 --> 16:18.140
Wait a minute. What's that?

16:34.060 --> 16:35.610
Careful.

16:35.660 --> 16:36.780
Almost cut myself.

16:38.380 --> 16:39.850
What are you doing?

16:39.900 --> 16:41.690
Showing my appreciation.

16:41.740 --> 16:43.050
For what?

16:43.100 --> 16:45.290
For staying overnight to protect me.

16:45.340 --> 16:48.650
Couldn't leave my damsel in distress
all alone with her parents away,
could I?

16:48.700 --> 16:50.530
Your damsel?

16:50.580 --> 16:51.660
My damsel.

16:53.500 --> 16:54.890
I'm sorry about all this.

16:54.940 --> 16:57.700
It's not your fault men
can't help falling at your feet.

17:05.859 --> 17:07.170
What is it?

17:07.220 --> 17:08.890
I just saw him outside.

17:08.940 --> 17:11.730
Stay here. Lock the door behind me.

17:11.780 --> 17:14.540
~ Well, don't go out there.
~ I'll be all right.

17:31.140 --> 17:32.860
He went this way.

17:40.260 --> 17:42.330
We've been out
here for over half an hour.

17:42.380 --> 17:44.210
I think we should...

17:44.260 --> 17:46.290
~ What was that?
~ What?

17:46.340 --> 17:49.250
~ I thought I heard something.
~ You're hearing things.

17:49.300 --> 17:51.010
Any sign of Welkin?

17:51.060 --> 17:52.930
No. No-one's been in or out.

17:52.980 --> 17:55.730
We thought we saw someone
on the field coming this way.

17:55.780 --> 17:57.490
I'm going back to check on Laura.

17:57.540 --> 17:59.090
Where's Smythe?

17:59.140 --> 18:00.730
Well, he's in his room.

18:00.780 --> 18:02.250
He said he wanted to be on his...

18:02.300 --> 18:03.620
Help!

18:14.260 --> 18:16.250
Holy Mother of God.

18:16.300 --> 18:17.660
Call an ambulance.

18:20.260 --> 18:21.700
WEAKLY: Welkin.

18:29.020 --> 18:37.020
.. Ut a peccatis liberatum
te salvet atque propitius allevet.

18:40.500 --> 18:42.730
I never should have left him alone.

18:42.780 --> 18:45.610
You sure he couldn't have
got past you?

18:45.660 --> 18:47.610
We were outside the whole time.

18:47.660 --> 18:50.290
Rear exit's open.
Lock's unbolted, same as here.

18:50.340 --> 18:55.930
He must've made Mr Smythe unlock
the doors with his mind control.

18:55.980 --> 18:57.490
Still here, Mrs McCarthy?

18:57.540 --> 18:59.780
You too, Father.
This is a crime scene.

19:01.660 --> 19:03.610
The windows were secure.

19:03.660 --> 19:05.010
What about the air vent?

19:05.060 --> 19:07.290
Too small for Welkin
to have got through that.

19:07.340 --> 19:09.020
Inspector?

19:14.340 --> 19:17.410
Was he burning this
when he was attacked?

19:17.460 --> 19:19.210
I'll take that, thank you.

19:19.260 --> 19:20.580
Why?

19:22.300 --> 19:25.010
I believe you've been
looking for me.

19:25.060 --> 19:27.020
Arthur Welkin, at your service.

19:29.340 --> 19:30.730
A sing-a-long?

19:30.780 --> 19:33.930
Yes, it was a grand old time.
Lovely people, the Kemblefordians.

19:33.980 --> 19:37.170
You're not from here, are you?
I can tell. City boy?

19:37.220 --> 19:38.970
What was the name of this pub?

19:39.020 --> 19:42.330
Why are you all the way out here?
That's what I want to know.

19:42.380 --> 19:43.730
I'm asking the questions.

19:43.780 --> 19:44.980
Let me guess...

19:46.020 --> 19:48.930
.. running away from something?

19:48.980 --> 19:50.460
Ex-girlfriend? No.

19:52.340 --> 19:54.220
Domineering father.

19:55.540 --> 19:57.330
Yes...

19:57.380 --> 19:58.740
That's it.

20:02.420 --> 20:03.940
What was the name?

20:05.100 --> 20:06.810
The Cloak and Dagger.

20:06.860 --> 20:08.780
That's apt, wouldn't you say?

20:17.620 --> 20:20.170
You threatened Mr Smythe's
life this morning

20:20.220 --> 20:22.770
and later threw a knife at him
after the performance.

20:22.820 --> 20:26.370
~ Nonsense. ~ Then why did he say your
name before he died?

20:26.420 --> 20:27.730
Oh, did he? How sweet!

~ A dying declaration.

20:36.500 --> 20:37.660
Exactly.

20:39.940 --> 20:42.420
Perhaps it was a declaration
of love.

20:44.220 --> 20:45.620
We shall never know.

20:53.820 --> 20:55.650
That was Jez Watts.

20:55.700 --> 20:58.090
Him and the lads
were in The Cloak tonight.

20:58.140 --> 21:00.050
~ Yes, and?
~ Welkin's telling the truth.

21:00.100 --> 21:02.170
He was there
at the time of the murder,

21:02.220 --> 21:04.730
singing along in front
of about 30-odd regulars.

21:04.780 --> 21:07.130
I believe that means
you'll have to release me,

21:07.180 --> 21:11.460

to be in two places at once?

'50s MUSIC PLAYS

21:33.860 --> 21:35.580
Good morning, my dear.

21:36.700 --> 21:39.130
How are you after
last night's excitement?

21:39.180 --> 21:41.170
What do you want?

21:41.220 --> 21:42.970
To claim my prize.

21:43.020 --> 21:45.300
~ That was just a joke.
~ It was your word.

21:47.500 --> 21:49.810
But the agreement was you had
to make your fortune -

21:49.860 --> 21:51.250
that was your word, too.

21:51.300 --> 21:54.700
The fortune I have to offer
is worth more than money can buy.

21:56.460 --> 22:00.860
You will marry me and with great
willingness of spirit.

22:04.940 --> 22:09.970
You were romantically involved
with Mr Smythe, is that right?

22:10.020 --> 22:12.090
Must've been very upsetting
when he jilted you.

22:12.140 --> 22:14.170
I didn't kill him!

22:14.220 --> 22:15.940
But you did punch him on the nose?

22:17.220 --> 22:19.530
He deserved it after what he did.

22:19.580 --> 22:22.090
~ And you are? ~ Marvin Morris.

22:22.140 --> 22:23.890
I've got a motive too.

22:23.940 --> 22:26.330
~ Want to hear it?
~ Please.

22:26.380 --> 22:29.010
Reggie was a backstabbing,
small-minded, petty...

22:29.060 --> 22:30.810
Stop it!

22:30.860 --> 22:34.020
He walked out on Enid,
walked out on our double-act.

22:35.500 --> 22:39.290
Where were you both
at the time of the murder?

22:39.340 --> 22:40.730
Having a stroll in the fields.

22:40.780 --> 22:42.810
Together?

22:42.860 --> 22:44.100
In the dark?

22:45.220 --> 22:47.570
With a storm on its way?

22:47.620 --> 22:49.340
I was upset. I needed some air.

22:51.220 --> 22:52.730
Witnesses?

22:52.780 --> 22:54.530
We didn't see anyone.

22:54.580 --> 22:56.450
How convenient.

22:56.500 --> 23:00.540
Well, until this case is over,
no vanishing acts, please.

23:06.700 --> 23:09.970
Maybe I should run down to the cafe,
see where she's got to.

23:10.020 --> 23:12.300
If she's much later,
Father, you'll have to cancel.

23:14.340 --> 23:16.330
How was she this morning?

23:16.380 --> 23:18.940
Tired. Barely said a word
before she left for work.

23:20.180 --> 23:22.130
Let's go down to the cafe together.

Good morning.

23:37.940 --> 23:40.290
I don't believe we've been
properly introduced. I am...

23:40.340 --> 23:42.330
I know who you are.

23:42.380 --> 23:43.650
Laura, what's going on?

23:43.700 --> 23:46.460
We've some wonderful news.
Tell them, my dear.

23:48.020 --> 23:49.490
We're getting married.

23:49.540 --> 23:51.490
~ You're what?
~ You heard her.

23:51.540 --> 23:53.650
Tomorrow morning
we'll leave with the circus,

23:53.700 --> 23:56.330
and shortly thereafter,
join in blissful union.

23:56.380 --> 23:57.810
Have you gone mad?

23:57.860 --> 23:59.850
I'm sorry, Nicholas.

23:59.900 --> 24:01.850
I understand
you're her former suitor.

24:01.900 --> 24:05.450
I do hope you'll be a gentleman
and bow out with grace and decorum.

24:05.500 --> 24:07.250
Outside, now.

24:07.300 --> 24:08.570
Clearly not.

24:08.620 --> 24:10.260
No, Nicholas.

24:11.620 --> 24:13.980
I want to talk to Laura alone.

24:14.980 --> 24:17.250
Anything you say to Laura
you can say to me.

24:17.300 --> 24:19.010
Do you really want to marry this man?

24:19.060 --> 24:20.940
Rather an impertinent question.

24:23.660 --> 24:26.970
I know it seems sudden, but I've
never felt so in love before.

24:27.020 --> 24:28.130
What?!

24:28.180 --> 24:30.810
Yesterday, you were
terrified of Mr Welkin

24:30.860 --> 24:33.530
and now you say
you're in love with him?

24:33.580 --> 24:37.330
I can hardly believe it myself,
but Arthur's shown me a side of him

24:37.380 --> 24:38.930
I hadn't seen before -

24:38.980 --> 24:41.570
warm, caring, funny.

24:41.620 --> 24:44.610
Yes, I have a wonderful
sense of humour.

24:44.660 --> 24:46.770
I want to marry him.

24:46.820 --> 24:48.450
And there you have it.

24:48.500 --> 24:50.260
Let's speak in my study.

24:59.460 --> 25:01.770
Let me perform the ceremony.

25:01.820 --> 25:03.330
I can fit you in tomorrow afternoon.

25:03.380 --> 25:05.490
Father?!

25:05.540 --> 25:08.530
Any other priest
would make you wait six months.

25:08.580 --> 25:11.890
~ You're willing to break protocol?
~ I've been known to bend the rules.

25:11.940 --> 25:14.620
~ We'd have to delay our departure.
~ Only for a few hours.

25:16.260 --> 25:19.770
Very well. Tomorrow it is.

25:19.820 --> 25:21.010
What have you done to her?

25:21.060 --> 25:22.490
Merely stirred her passions.

25:22.540 --> 25:23.610
I'll kill you.

25:23.660 --> 25:26.140
That would solve nothing.

25:28.460 --> 25:31.610
Laura, what is this?
I don't understand.

25:31.660 --> 25:33.890
Goodbye, Nicholas.

25:33.940 --> 25:35.620
You understand that, don't you?

25:39.500 --> 25:41.340
Goodbye!

25:46.660 --> 25:48.610
You're not seriously
going to marry them?

25:48.660 --> 25:50.330
~ Of course not. ~ He's hypnotised her.

25:50.380 --> 25:52.130
He must have. She wasn't herself.

25:52.180 --> 25:54.170
Even the most suggestible person

25:54.220 --> 25:56.850
can't be hypnotised
to marry against their will.

25:56.900 --> 25:59.460
~ There must be something
else going on. ~ What?

26:00.820 --> 26:02.890
There's only one thing for it -

26:02.940 --> 26:04.820
I need to talk to Laura on her own.

26:14.300 --> 26:15.700
Home, sweet home.

26:16.740 --> 26:18.140
It's lovely.

26:22.020 --> 26:25.060
Don't worry, my dear,
I shall be the perfect gentleman...

26:26.340 --> 26:28.570
.. until after we're married,
of course.

26:28.620 --> 26:30.250
Welkin!

26:30.300 --> 26:31.780
Excuse me.

Welkin!

DOG BARKS

26:40.740 --> 26:42.250
You did it, didn't you?

26:42.300 --> 26:43.610
Did what?

26:43.660 --> 26:45.490
Killed Reggie.

26:45.540 --> 26:47.650
If I had, I'd have thought
you'd be thanking me.

26:47.700 --> 26:50.860
He might've been an idiot,
but he didn't deserve to die.

26:52.180 --> 26:54.580
You did it
and I'm going to prove it.

27:00.260 --> 27:03.290
My dear, if it's not an imposition,

27:03.340 --> 27:05.180
I'd like you to do something for me.

27:07.620 --> 27:10.250
Let's say Enid Flay
climbed through the air vent.

27:10.300 --> 27:11.930
How did she get up there?

27:11.980 --> 27:14.650
Either Marvin Morris helped her,
or she used a ladder,

27:14.700 --> 27:17.170
then she stabbed him,
unlocked the door and escaped.

27:17.220 --> 27:19.810
~ KNOCK ON DOOR
~ Come in.

27:19.860 --> 27:22.810
Sorry to disturb you,
but I've just come from the circus.

27:22.860 --> 27:25.740
I saw something -
something terrible.

27:28.380 --> 27:32.980
PIANO MUSIC PLAYS

27:48.260 --> 27:53.020
Enid Flay, I have
a warrant to search your...

27:54.540 --> 27:56.770
.. caravan.

27:56.820 --> 27:58.490
What a surprise.

27:58.540 --> 27:59.930
What can I say?

27:59.980 --> 28:01.850
I love the circus.

28:01.900 --> 28:04.130
Search it for what?

28:04.180 --> 28:06.170
We'll see.

28:06.220 --> 28:07.660
Shall we?

28:09.460 --> 28:10.700
Oi!

28:15.620 --> 28:17.570
Clear, sir.

28:17.620 --> 28:19.410
I haven't done anything!

28:19.460 --> 28:21.970
Oh, yes? Had some company, have we?

28:22.020 --> 28:23.450
This is harassment.

28:23.500 --> 28:24.740
What have we got here?

28:28.140 --> 28:29.490
Someone put that there!

28:29.540 --> 28:30.930
That's what they all say.

28:30.980 --> 28:33.530
I'm taking you both
in for questioning. Sergeant.

28:33.580 --> 28:35.020
Come on, you.

28:38.140 --> 28:40.370
How did you know
to search the caravan?

28:40.420 --> 28:43.290
Enid invited Laura for tea.
She saw the knife in the cupboard.

28:43.340 --> 28:46.810
~ That's a lie! ~ And also none
of your concern, Father.

28:46.860 --> 28:50.370
But if Enid killed Smythe, why did
he say Welkin's name before he died?

28:50.420 --> 28:53.610
Probably because he didn't want
to incriminate his girlfriend.

28:53.660 --> 28:55.010
You're clutching at straws.

28:55.060 --> 28:58.290
And you, once again, are stepping
way outside your bounds.

28:58.340 --> 29:01.090
~ What about the burnt fabric...?
~ Goodbye, Father.

29:01.140 --> 29:03.570
There's something you need to know -

29:03.620 --> 29:06.010
Laura Hope
is under Welkin's influence.

29:06.060 --> 29:08.250
She's been coerced
into marrying him.

29:08.300 --> 29:11.130
Yes. Well, Welkin has an alibi.

29:11.180 --> 29:14.290
He was at a pub sing-a-long
at the exact time.

29:14.340 --> 29:15.860
A sing-a-long?!

29:17.060 --> 29:19.570
Apparently he does a raucous
Knees-Up Mother Brown.

29:19.620 --> 29:21.530
So, unless you have an explanation

29:21.580 --> 29:23.690
as to how he can be
in two places at once,

29:23.740 --> 29:27.050
I suggest you go back to St Mary's
and allow me to close this case.

29:27.100 --> 29:28.860
Understood?

30:02.820 --> 30:04.420
It belonged to my mother.

30:05.420 --> 30:08.690
I thought it was bad luck for the
groom to see the bride in her
wedding dress.

30:08.740 --> 30:11.340
Well, I don't believe
in that superstitious nonsense.

30:13.100 --> 30:14.460
I believe only in love.

30:16.140 --> 30:17.780
Love is the real magic.

30:32.980 --> 30:34.220
You are so beautiful.

30:36.660 --> 30:38.340
I'll leave you to undress, my dear.

30:46.740 --> 30:48.490
What are you doing here?

30:48.540 --> 30:50.170
Tell me what's happening.

30:50.220 --> 30:52.090
Exactly what it looks like.

30:52.140 --> 30:54.850
That you're being
forced into marriage?

30:54.900 --> 30:55.930
No.

30:55.980 --> 30:57.700
Tell me why you're doing this.

30:58.860 --> 31:00.370
I'm paying penance.

31:00.420 --> 31:01.820
Penance?

31:03.180 --> 31:04.500
What for?!

31:07.220 --> 31:08.490
Arthur!

31:08.540 --> 31:09.900
Laura, no, please.

31:11.420 --> 31:13.570
He just barged in.

31:13.620 --> 31:15.730
Father Brown, I'm beginning
to get the impression

31:15.780 --> 31:19.260
~ you're having second thoughts
about marrying us. ~ Not at all.

31:20.940 --> 31:24.090
Are you sure?
We can always marry elsewhere.

31:24.140 --> 31:25.730
I gave my word.

31:25.780 --> 31:27.570
Tomorrow it is.

31:27.620 --> 31:30.660
Very well. If you'll excuse us,
we have a wedding to prepare for.

31:48.900 --> 31:51.500
We've examined the knife -
no fingerprints.

31:52.740 --> 31:55.370
But the blood type
matches Mr Smythe's.

31:55.420 --> 31:58.610
This is your last chance
to tell the truth.

31:58.660 --> 32:00.020
We...

32:02.260 --> 32:04.690
We spent the night together.

32:04.740 --> 32:06.490
The night Mr Smythe was killed?

32:06.540 --> 32:08.050
But we didn't kill him.

32:08.100 --> 32:10.850
You've lied once already.
Why should I believe you now?

32:10.900 --> 32:12.570
Do you really think, if I did it,

32:12.620 --> 32:15.890
I'd be stupid enough to leave a
blood-stained knife in my caravan?

32:15.940 --> 32:19.090
Murderers have made many stupid
mistakes, you won't be the last.

32:19.140 --> 32:21.130
I'm not a murderer.

32:21.180 --> 32:23.530
You had means,
motive and opportunity.

32:23.580 --> 32:26.180
I'm charging you with
the murder of Reggie Smythe.

32:32.620 --> 32:35.260
Could you hold these? Thank you.

32:45.980 --> 32:48.900
~ You're a dab hand with the lock
pick. ~ Beginner's luck.

32:52.900 --> 32:55.690
I don't understand why we're here.

32:55.740 --> 32:57.610
Laura said something
that made me wonder.

32:57.660 --> 32:59.100
Wonder what?

33:00.100 --> 33:01.700
What are you looking for?

33:03.540 --> 33:05.060
I'll know it when I see it.

33:13.980 --> 33:15.610
Laura's room?

33:15.660 --> 33:16.900
Yes.

33:22.340 --> 33:23.610
What was here?

33:23.660 --> 33:25.180
I think it was a lamp.

33:27.860 --> 33:29.650
Ah-ha!

33:29.700 --> 33:31.570
So it broke. So what?

33:31.620 --> 33:34.730
You said Laura had trouble sleeping,
the night of the murder.

33:34.780 --> 33:36.650
Well, it's hardly surprising.

33:36.700 --> 33:40.810
How was she when you got back to
the house AFTER you'd left the B&B?

33:40.860 --> 33:44.290
Scared witless. Jumping at shadows.

33:44.340 --> 33:47.740
I think I know what
Mr Smythe was burning.

34:10.540 --> 34:14.130
Try to stay calm.
Father Brown always has a plan.

34:14.179 --> 34:15.659
You do, don't you?

34:16.659 --> 34:18.210
Oh, here they are now.

34:18.260 --> 34:20.010
Well-wishers - how nice.

34:20.060 --> 34:23.020
Let her go. However you're doing it,
let her go.

34:24.179 --> 34:25.420
Trust me.

34:27.300 --> 34:28.900
Let's go in, shall we?

34:49.500 --> 34:52.139
Why did the lamp
break in your bedroom?

34:53.659 --> 34:55.210
What?

34:55.260 --> 34:57.890
The lamp in your bedroom window,
why did it break?

34:57.940 --> 34:59.140
The wind.

35:00.340 --> 35:02.650
I saw tread marks on the window sill.

35:02.700 --> 35:04.250
He's wasting our time.

35:04.300 --> 35:06.020
I know why you're doing penance.

35:08.100 --> 35:10.650
You killed Mr Smythe, didn't you?

35:10.700 --> 35:11.890
What?

35:11.940 --> 35:15.650
~ Don't say a word. He knows nothing.
~ I know enough.

35:15.700 --> 35:19.170
Mr Smythe didn't stay
in his room that night,

35:19.220 --> 35:23.570
that's why he was so insistent that
me and Mrs McCarthy left him alone...

35:23.620 --> 35:25.500
so he could come to you.

35:27.100 --> 35:28.620
He broke the lamp...

35:29.940 --> 35:31.500
.. climbing through your window.

35:39.300 --> 35:42.210
I think I know what happened next,

35:42.260 --> 35:43.540
but why don't you tell me?

35:46.380 --> 35:48.250
It was an accident.

35:48.300 --> 35:50.220
I didn't mean to kill him.

35:53.740 --> 35:56.540
SOUND OF BREAKING GLASS

36:06.900 --> 36:08.460
I thought it was Welkin.

36:10.380 --> 36:11.650
SHE GASPS

36:11.700 --> 36:13.180
HE GROANS

36:18.340 --> 36:22.170
He told me not to call an ambulance,
said it wasn't serious.

36:22.220 --> 36:25.410
He wanted to go back to the B&B
and pretend that Welkin did it,

36:25.460 --> 36:28.170
get him arrested
for attempted murder.

36:28.220 --> 36:31.020
So you dressed his wound with this.

36:32.260 --> 36:33.940
I found it in your sewing basket.

36:36.420 --> 36:37.810
You have to go to hospital!

36:37.860 --> 36:40.220
I'm fine. It barely hurts.

36:41.740 --> 36:43.180
What are you doing here?!

36:44.740 --> 36:46.220
I wanted to see you.

36:47.500 --> 36:52.050
I understand you don't love me,
but at least let me do this for you.

36:52.100 --> 36:54.610
He gave me the knife
and went back to the B&B.

36:54.660 --> 36:56.130
Hmm.

36:56.180 --> 36:57.850
Where he removed the dressing,

36:57.900 --> 37:02.770
no doubt realising his wound was
far more serious than he thought,

37:02.820 --> 37:05.820
burned the evidence,
then cried bloody murder.

37:22.300 --> 37:23.860
Help!

37:26.540 --> 37:28.340
Oh!

37:29.380 --> 37:30.740
Help!

37:32.980 --> 37:35.410
That doesn't explain
why you agreed to marry him.

37:35.460 --> 37:36.700
Yes, it does.

37:38.220 --> 37:39.860
You saw it all, didn't you?

37:41.220 --> 37:43.180
How else would you have got the
knife?

37:58.820 --> 38:03.580
Then you went directly to the pub
to give yourself an alibi.

38:10.980 --> 38:12.730
Why didn't you go to the police?

38:12.780 --> 38:14.610
After I'd already
covered up what I did?

38:14.660 --> 38:16.770
How's that going to look?

38:16.820 --> 38:18.970
Besides, I thought
it was a just punishment

38:19.020 --> 38:22.940
after what I did to Mr Smythe -
hell on Earth with Mr Welkin.

38:24.300 --> 38:25.820
You're not a murderer.

38:27.140 --> 38:30.410
You don't deserve hell on Earth,
or anywhere else.

38:30.460 --> 38:32.650
This doesn't change anything.
She killed Smythe,

38:32.700 --> 38:35.810
and if she doesn't want to go to
prison, she'll marry me.

38:35.860 --> 38:38.060
And with great willingness
of spirit.

38:43.940 --> 38:46.610
Is that what you think love is?

38:46.660 --> 38:47.970
Control?

38:48.020 --> 38:49.170
Possession?

38:49.220 --> 38:51.700
How does a priest know anything
about love?

38:53.020 --> 38:55.450
Mr Smythe knew what love was.

38:55.500 --> 38:56.770
You know nothing about me.

38:56.820 --> 39:00.220
I know you're a charlatan
with a bag of cheap tricks.

39:01.340 --> 39:04.610
What I feel for Laura
is not a trick.

39:04.660 --> 39:06.570
It's real.

39:06.620 --> 39:10.540
If that is so, then why are
you so blind to her suffering?

39:12.700 --> 39:14.900
You are not the person
who should be doing penance...

39:16.260 --> 39:17.780
.. you are.

39:22.140 --> 39:23.900
Laura?

39:35.860 --> 39:37.620
Goodbye, Mr Welkin.

39:44.220 --> 39:46.570
It's over.

39:46.620 --> 39:48.210
No, it's not.

39:48.260 --> 39:50.850
I have to confess
to Inspector Sullivan.

39:50.900 --> 39:52.730
No.

39:52.780 --> 39:54.980
I won't let someone else
pay for my crime.

39:58.500 --> 40:00.100
Father...

40:03.940 --> 40:05.220
She's right.

40:31.620 --> 40:33.100
Inspector?

40:34.140 --> 40:35.770
I have something to tell you.

40:35.820 --> 40:37.500
Inspector?

40:40.300 --> 40:41.810
It's a confession...

40:41.860 --> 40:43.730
from Welkin.

40:43.780 --> 40:47.650
He says that Smythe snuck
out of the B&B and confronted him,

40:47.700 --> 40:49.450
so Welkin stabbed him.

40:49.500 --> 40:52.250
~ That's not... ~ Where is he now?

40:52.300 --> 40:53.620
I have no idea.

40:54.980 --> 40:57.740
And this note... is for you.

41:07.820 --> 41:13.210
"Laura, my love, this confession
I make in your honour.

41:13.260 --> 41:15.020
"It is my sacrifice for you..."

41:17.060 --> 41:20.690
"I shall disappear
and never be found,

41:20.740 --> 41:22.340
"for who can find a phantom?

41:23.900 --> 41:27.170
"Without love, that's all I am.

41:27.220 --> 41:29.050
"I am nothing.

41:29.100 --> 41:30.380
"I am hollow.

41:31.540 --> 41:32.900
"I am dust."

41:38.380 --> 41:42.220
CHURCH BELLS RING OUT

41:48.660 --> 41:50.290
My heart's thundering.

41:50.340 --> 41:51.610
That's a good sign.

41:51.660 --> 41:53.610
She'll be here any minute.

41:53.660 --> 41:55.700
Now, you should be inside.

41:58.340 --> 42:01.570
Well, Father, when are you going
to tell us what happened?

42:01.620 --> 42:03.370
I don't know what you're talking
about.

42:03.420 --> 42:05.010
Why did Laura agree to marry Welkin?

42:05.060 --> 42:08.530
Like Mrs McCarthy said,
he had strange powers.

42:08.580 --> 42:10.940
It was the hypnotism, I knew it!

42:13.140 --> 42:16.130
Oh! You look beautiful.

42:16.180 --> 42:19.330
~ I'm a bundle of nerves.
~ That's a good sign.

42:19.380 --> 42:21.730
I'll go and tell the ushers
she's here.

42:21.780 --> 42:23.700
Deep breaths. Good luck.

42:29.060 --> 42:30.380
Ready?

42:32.060 --> 42:33.290
Ready.
