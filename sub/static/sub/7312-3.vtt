00:03.391 --> 00:05.913
â™ª I have a staff meeting
on Thursday night

00:05.956 --> 00:07.000
that'll probably go late.

00:09.086 --> 00:12.173
You free around 10:00?

00:12.217 --> 00:14.521
I don't think so, Gary.

00:15.521 --> 00:17.347
[door unbolting]

00:17.391 --> 00:18.478
[door opening]What was that?

00:20.086 --> 00:21.652
[turns off music]

00:21.695 --> 00:23.478
Someone's downstairs.

00:28.869 --> 00:29.913
[cocks gun]

00:31.347 --> 00:32.782
What are you doing?

00:34.260 --> 00:35.217
Heather!

00:35.260 --> 00:36.347
Stay there.

00:45.173 --> 00:46.260
Hold it!

00:46.304 --> 00:48.782
[gunshots]

00:48.826 --> 00:49.869
[shell casings clattering]

01:26.869 --> 01:28.652
MAN:
You look great.

01:28.695 --> 01:30.521
TONY:
Ah, I try.

01:30.565 --> 01:33.521
MAN: All right, start wide--
we're gonna work our way in.

01:33.565 --> 01:34.521
MAN:
Yeah?

01:34.565 --> 01:35.869
Oh. Okay.

01:35.913 --> 01:36.652
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Look this way.

01:36.695 --> 01:38.000
Okay, good.

01:38.043 --> 01:39.043
Right there.

01:39.086 --> 01:40.478
Good!

01:40.521 --> 01:41.826
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Look back at your computer.

01:41.869 --> 01:43.913
McGEE:
Ziva, what's going on:?

01:43.956 --> 01:46.913
Tony has been selected to be on
the front cover of the new NCIS

01:46.956 --> 01:48.173
recruiting brochure.

01:48.217 --> 01:50.000
Oh, you gotta
be kidding me.

01:50.043 --> 01:51.217
Hey! Check it out.

01:51.260 --> 01:53.391
Who's the new face of NCIS?

01:53.434 --> 01:55.260
You're looking at it, McEnvy.

01:55.304 --> 01:56.434
Get used to it.

01:56.478 --> 01:58.695
There will be no living
with him now.

01:58.739 --> 02:00.217
Now?

02:00.260 --> 02:01.260
All right, Tony,
just pretend like

02:01.304 --> 02:02.608
you're working at your computer.

02:02.652 --> 02:03.652
Yeah, that should
look very natural.

02:03.695 --> 02:04.956
He does that
all the time.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.521
TONY:
Like working for real?

02:10.347 --> 02:12.521
Can we-- I'm sorry.

02:12.565 --> 02:16.086
Because... I think
my left side is better,

02:16.130 --> 02:18.304
and we're doing a lot of...

02:18.347 --> 02:19.304
Did Gibbs authorize this?

02:19.347 --> 02:20.869
GIBBS:
Nope, wasn't consulted.

02:20.913 --> 02:24.130
You're up. Marine shot and
killed an intruder in Arlington.

02:26.173 --> 02:29.086
Special Agent Gibbs,
Ron Sands, Public Affairs.

02:29.130 --> 02:31.478
Yeah, I know who
you are, Sandy.

02:31.521 --> 02:33.173
Special Agent DiNozzo
can't leave, sir.

02:34.913 --> 02:36.956
We're not finished
with him yet.

02:42.043 --> 02:43.565
I'll drive, boss.

02:47.478 --> 02:49.652
All right.
Take five.

02:49.695 --> 02:51.826
Thanks. Hey, boss?

02:51.869 --> 02:54.217
TONY: Police think it was a
home invasion robbery gone bad.

02:54.260 --> 02:55.913
Back door was jimmied.

02:55.956 --> 02:58.260
Guy clearly had no idea whose
house he was breaking into.

02:58.304 --> 03:00.521
Ooh-rah!

03:00.565 --> 03:01.565
They ID the body?

03:01.608 --> 03:03.173
Uh, no, nothing on him.

03:03.217 --> 03:05.565
No wallet, no car keys...
Don't even know how he got here.

03:05.608 --> 03:07.391
Only thing he brought
with him was a gun.

03:07.434 --> 03:09.260
Intruder's weapon.

03:09.304 --> 03:11.782
Serial number's been filed off.
Maybe Abby can lift something.

03:11.826 --> 03:13.739
Get the
fingerprint scanner.

03:13.782 --> 03:15.043
GIBBS: DiNozzo, make sure
you check upstairs.

03:15.086 --> 03:16.608
Just about to, boss.Hey, Tony.

03:16.652 --> 03:18.130
Can you help me
with this?

03:20.086 --> 03:21.130
Are you wearing makeup?

03:22.652 --> 03:24.304
This in Afghanistan?

03:24.347 --> 03:26.304
Yeah. It was
two months ago.

03:26.347 --> 03:27.608
Kandahar.

03:27.652 --> 03:28.652
You take the picture?

03:28.695 --> 03:29.652
No.

03:29.695 --> 03:31.347
I am the picture.

03:33.304 --> 03:35.695
You're a bomb tech.

03:35.739 --> 03:38.521
Just being a regular office
POG didn't cut it for me.

03:38.565 --> 03:40.391
Any regrets?

03:40.434 --> 03:41.956
Still got all my fingers.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.391
[cell phone rings]

03:43.434 --> 03:44.869
It's my team leader.
I'm on call.

03:44.913 --> 03:45.782
Dempsey.

03:48.782 --> 03:51.130
911 call was
at 2:25 a.m.

03:51.173 --> 03:53.695
Well, that's pretty consistent
with the time of death.

03:53.739 --> 03:55.695
DUCKY:
Three shots, you say?

03:55.739 --> 03:59.217
Well, she certainly
knew where to put them.

03:59.260 --> 04:00.782
Yes, Sergeant. I understand.

04:00.826 --> 04:02.565
Get her
statement?
HEATHER:
On my way.

04:02.608 --> 04:04.043
Yes.

04:04.086 --> 04:06.695
Don't you guys work
out of the Navy Yard?

04:06.739 --> 04:08.304
They received a bomb threat
from an anti-war group.

04:08.347 --> 04:09.869
ZIVA:
Where on the base?

04:09.913 --> 04:12.260
Aboard the ceremonial
ship, the USS Barry,

04:12.304 --> 04:15.217
HEATHER:
I need to go.

04:15.260 --> 04:16.695
When do I get my weapon back?

04:16.739 --> 04:17.434
When we're
finished with it.

04:21.956 --> 04:22.913
Hey.

04:22.956 --> 04:24.173
Hey.

04:24.217 --> 04:25.086
Nice apartment.

04:26.260 --> 04:27.695
[chuckling]

04:27.739 --> 04:29.695
What?

04:29.739 --> 04:31.652
She say she was
alone last night?

04:31.695 --> 04:35.260
Yeah.
I don't think so.

04:35.304 --> 04:36.869
Why?
Well, I was
poking around

04:36.913 --> 04:38.608
upstairs, like you asked me to,

04:38.652 --> 04:40.347
and I noticed there
was a queen-sized bed

04:40.391 --> 04:41.782
with both sides rumpled.

04:41.826 --> 04:43.434
And that does not
mean anything.

04:43.478 --> 04:45.260
ZIVA:
I do not make my bed every day.

04:45.304 --> 04:49.086
But I bet you sleep
on the same side of it.

04:49.130 --> 04:51.086
That it?
Nope.

04:51.130 --> 04:52.956
Toilet seat was up.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.652
Maybe she's more Marine than
I thought.
[scanner beeping]

04:54.695 --> 04:56.869
McGEE: Boss, we're
having a problem here.

04:56.913 --> 04:58.043
I can't get a scan.

04:58.086 --> 05:00.434
DUCKY:
Wait a minute.

05:02.652 --> 05:05.260
His fingerprints
have been removed.

05:05.304 --> 05:07.043
TONY:
Wow, imagine that.

05:07.086 --> 05:09.434
A burglar that
doesn't need gloves.

05:09.478 --> 05:11.956
[techno-punk music
plays loudly]

05:12.000 --> 05:13.391
TONY: There's talk that

05:13.434 --> 05:15.217
after the recruitment
brochure is published,

05:15.260 --> 05:17.695
I may do a promotional
tour of college campuses.

05:17.739 --> 05:20.347
Frightening thought
for the co-eds of America.

05:20.391 --> 05:22.347
They're gonna put a giant
cardboard cutout of me

05:22.391 --> 05:23.478
in Career Services

05:23.521 --> 05:25.173
to greet new applicants.

05:29.913 --> 05:32.347
Abby, why's the
music so loud?

05:32.391 --> 05:33.695
[turns off music,
sirens blaring outside]

05:33.739 --> 05:35.260
I'm trying to drown out
the sirens.

05:35.304 --> 05:36.608
What's going on out there?

05:36.652 --> 05:38.260
The bomb threat
on the Barry.

05:38.304 --> 05:41.086
Okay, then why aren't you guys
out there investigating that

05:41.130 --> 05:42.695
instead of being in here,
bugging me?

05:42.739 --> 05:44.347
Agent Krone
is handling it.

05:44.391 --> 05:45.260
Hmm.

05:46.608 --> 05:48.739
We need your help.

05:48.782 --> 05:50.826
I'm... I'm a
little busy.

05:50.869 --> 05:52.565
I have to get the serial
number off this gun.

05:57.739 --> 06:00.739
Okay. Facial recognition,
nothing yet, huh?

06:00.782 --> 06:03.652
No, McGee.
I would've called.

06:03.695 --> 06:06.304
I've run him through every
U.S. database and got nothing,

06:06.347 --> 06:07.695
and now I'm running him
through Interpol.

06:10.260 --> 06:11.347
McGEE:
Doesn't make sense.

06:11.391 --> 06:13.391
This guy's obviously
got a criminal past.

06:13.434 --> 06:15.695
Why else would he have
his fingerprints removed?

06:15.739 --> 06:19.000
TONY: Abby, I emailed you
an audio file, okay,

06:19.043 --> 06:21.217
'cause there's a background
sound I need you to enhance?

06:23.913 --> 06:28.434
How did you get the password
to my account?

06:28.478 --> 06:30.043
McGee gave it to me.

06:30.086 --> 06:32.043
Thanks, McGee.
What?

06:32.086 --> 06:33.260
No, I didn't. I...

06:33.304 --> 06:35.130
There was no handing
out of any password.

06:35.173 --> 06:36.695
He did.

06:36.739 --> 06:38.217
No. No, I-I,
no, what...

06:38.260 --> 06:39.869
[computer beeps]No, hey...

06:39.913 --> 06:44.304
DISPATCHER: 911 operator. What
is the nature of your emergency?

06:44.347 --> 06:47.391
HEATHER: I just shot a man
who broke into my house.

06:47.434 --> 06:50.260
DISPATCHER: What's the address?
We'll dispatch an ambulance.

06:50.304 --> 06:51.347
HEATHER:
Don't need an ambulance.

06:51.391 --> 06:53.173
There's no rush. He's dead.

06:53.217 --> 06:54.434
She sounds really calm.

06:54.478 --> 06:55.869
Well, she diffuses
bombs for a living.

06:55.913 --> 06:57.434
Right.

06:57.478 --> 06:59.043
Okay, wait. Shh!
Here it comes. Listen.

06:59.086 --> 07:00.434
[muffled, distorted sound]

07:00.478 --> 07:02.043
'Scuse you,
McGee.

07:02.086 --> 07:03.043
TONY:
Play it again.

07:03.086 --> 07:04.043
[distorted sound]

07:04.086 --> 07:05.391
TONY:
There, see?

07:05.434 --> 07:06.391
That sounds
like a voice.

07:08.652 --> 07:10.869
McGEE:
Sounds like a TV? Radio, maybe?

07:10.913 --> 07:13.130
TONY: No, cause the
phone call goes on

07:13.173 --> 07:16.043
for two-and-a-half minutes,
and, uh, you only hear it once.

07:16.086 --> 07:17.695
[computer chirps]

07:17.739 --> 07:19.521
[muffled voice
from computer speakers]

07:20.304 --> 07:22.043
Okay, let's listen.

07:22.086 --> 07:23.782
VOICE: Couldn't call
earlier. I'm on my way.

07:25.739 --> 07:27.173
It's a man's voice.

07:27.217 --> 07:29.260
Someone else
was there.

07:29.304 --> 07:31.173
I knew she
was lying.

07:39.391 --> 07:42.826
ZIVA: Sergeant Dempsey
grew up in Greenough, Montana.

07:42.869 --> 07:44.434
Became a local
celebrity when she

07:44.478 --> 07:47.217
filed a discrimination lawsuit
against the Board of Education.

07:47.260 --> 07:49.173
They wouldn't let her play
high school football.

07:49.217 --> 07:51.782
One year of junior college,
then she enlisted in the Corps.

07:51.826 --> 07:53.304
Basic training
at Paris Island,

07:53.347 --> 07:55.434
two tours in Iraq with
a Civil Affairs group.

07:55.478 --> 07:58.608
and then E.O.D. school
at Eglin Air Force Base.

07:58.652 --> 08:00.347
Disciplinary actions?

08:00.391 --> 08:01.695
Yep. Three of them.

08:01.739 --> 08:03.782
One for fighting, two
for questioning authority.

08:03.826 --> 08:05.347
Clearly, she doesn't
play well with others.

08:05.391 --> 08:06.608
Family?

08:06.652 --> 08:08.086
Never been married.

08:08.130 --> 08:10.478
Parents divorced, and one
brother-- living in D.C.

08:10.521 --> 08:11.956
Boyfriend?

08:12.000 --> 08:14.086
No one came up.

08:14.130 --> 08:16.043
So, I ask you
once again,

08:16.086 --> 08:17.695
who was the guy
on the phone talking

08:17.739 --> 08:20.521
and why did she
lie to us about it?

08:20.565 --> 08:23.608
Well, there's no hardwired phone
in Sergeant Dempsey's residence,

08:23.652 --> 08:26.565
so our mystery caller
had to be using his cell.

08:26.608 --> 08:28.521
Checked the local towers
that hour.

08:28.565 --> 08:30.956
Usage was very low.
And we know the time

08:31.000 --> 08:32.869
of Sergeant Dempsey's call
to 911--

08:32.913 --> 08:34.782
that was 2:25 a.m.

08:34.826 --> 08:36.608
That exact moment,
there were only

08:36.652 --> 08:38.521
32 other cellular calls
in progress.

08:38.565 --> 08:40.434
I can run them down.

08:40.478 --> 08:41.782
Okay. Pressure Dempsey.

08:41.826 --> 08:44.043
Aye, aye.

08:44.086 --> 08:46.130
Can you, uh, track her
down for me, Ziva?

08:46.173 --> 08:47.391
Yeah.

08:47.434 --> 08:48.826
Thanks.
Sure.

08:48.869 --> 08:50.521
Hey, Tony,
how's it going?

08:50.565 --> 08:52.304
Oh, hey, Ron.
You need something?

08:52.347 --> 08:54.086
SANDS: Truth is,
I'm under the gun, here.

08:54.130 --> 08:55.869
I gotta get the artwork
to the printer tomorrow,

08:55.913 --> 08:57.956
but I'm not really sure

08:58.000 --> 08:59.608
I have the cover shot just yet.

09:02.391 --> 09:03.391
I have an idea.

09:03.434 --> 09:05.043
[typing, beeping]How about that?

09:06.608 --> 09:08.173
It's a beautiful
booking photo.

09:08.217 --> 09:09.608
TONY:
Green does bring out my eyes.

09:09.652 --> 09:12.173
That's pretty good.

09:12.217 --> 09:14.782
[hangs up phone]ZIVA: Heather Dempsey's
not answering.

09:14.826 --> 09:17.086
But there are still emergency
vehicles in front of the ship.

09:18.608 --> 09:20.739
What's going on?There's a bomb threat.

09:20.782 --> 09:22.391
SANDS:
On a ship?

09:22.434 --> 09:23.956
Sounds like a pretty
good photo op.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.478
SANDS:
You guys mind if I tag along?

09:25.521 --> 09:28.173
Uh, that's , uh,
not a good idea.

09:28.217 --> 09:31.173
You should really ask Gibbs
first this time, Tony.

09:35.217 --> 09:37.043
Grab your
photographer, Ronnie.

09:43.173 --> 09:44.956
So what do you think he used?

09:45.000 --> 09:46.869
Acid?

09:46.913 --> 09:48.043
DUCKY: Possibly. There
are several methods.

09:48.086 --> 09:50.217
Pineapple, for instance.

09:50.260 --> 09:51.260
Pineapple?

09:51.304 --> 09:52.826
Yeah, in the 1920s a cat burglar

09:52.869 --> 09:56.173
named Nigel Hubbard
left no fingerprints.

09:56.217 --> 09:57.956
Baffled Scotland
Yard for years.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.130
Pineapple contains
an acid, pectin.

10:01.173 --> 10:04.130
Hubbard pricked each of his
fingertips several times

10:04.173 --> 10:06.000
and then soaked them
in the juice of the fruit.

10:06.043 --> 10:09.130
It was very painful,
but effective.

10:09.173 --> 10:11.826
Columella-labial
junction.

10:11.869 --> 10:13.347
Oh, the outer portion
of his nose, here...

10:13.391 --> 10:15.304
No, no, no, no, not his.

10:15.347 --> 10:16.956
Mine. I have a confounded itch.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.043
If you would be so kind...

10:19.086 --> 10:20.608
Oh, I hate it
when it does this.

10:20.652 --> 10:21.608
Wait, wait, wait...

10:21.652 --> 10:23.739
Yeah.

10:23.782 --> 10:26.173
[relieved sigh]

10:26.217 --> 10:29.521
Am I interrupting
something, boys?

10:29.565 --> 10:32.173
Have we come up with a name
for this fellow yet?

10:32.217 --> 10:34.173
No. I was hoping
you'd help with that, Duck.

10:34.217 --> 10:36.913
Yeah, well, we may be able
to winnow it down a bit.

10:36.956 --> 10:40.434
His age, for example.

10:40.478 --> 10:43.608
Based on dentition and his
bones, I would say he's a man

10:43.652 --> 10:46.434
of between 55
and 60 years of age.

10:46.478 --> 10:48.434
Okay, that's a start.Well, there's more.

10:48.478 --> 10:51.434
His liver is not his own.Transplant.

10:51.478 --> 10:54.608
And by the look of the sutures
and the type of procedure used,

10:54.652 --> 10:57.304
I say it was done
15 to 20 years ago.

10:57.347 --> 11:00.043
And liver transplants weren't
all that common back then.

11:00.086 --> 11:02.043
Well, we haven't finished,
so there may be more.

11:02.086 --> 11:04.521
I've just been regaling
Mr. Palmer on the methods used

11:04.565 --> 11:07.521
by criminals to remove their
fingerprints over the years.

11:07.565 --> 11:09.043
It's fascinating stuff,

11:09.086 --> 11:11.826
as is the whole history
of dactyloscopy.

11:11.869 --> 11:15.086
It goes back to Edward Henry,

11:15.130 --> 11:18.913
inspector general of Bengal,
who in 1897...

11:22.217 --> 11:23.782
TONY:
What do you got, Agent Krone?

11:23.826 --> 11:25.130
Ship's been evacuated.

11:25.173 --> 11:27.260
Some kind of
anti-war protest.

11:27.304 --> 11:28.739
Phoned in a threat.

11:28.782 --> 11:31.565
And we found a suspicious
backpack down below.

11:31.608 --> 11:33.173
You guys are investigating
a shooting, right?

11:33.217 --> 11:35.173
Yep.You need some help?

11:35.217 --> 11:36.869
I'd love to show Agent
Gibbs what I can do.

11:36.913 --> 11:38.086
Think we got it covered,
Agent Krone.

11:38.130 --> 11:40.043
I have worked at the Navy Yard
for five years

11:40.086 --> 11:41.608
and I have never set foot
on this boat.

11:41.652 --> 11:42.956
Ship.
Whatever.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.956
SANDS:
It's used for
ceremonial purposes,

11:45.000 --> 11:46.391
open to the
public for tours.

11:46.434 --> 11:49.608
I'll be topside,
if you need me.

11:49.652 --> 11:50.913
Hey.Hey, you busy?

11:50.956 --> 11:51.913
I wish.

11:51.956 --> 11:53.869
Robbie the Robot's doing my job.

11:53.913 --> 11:55.173
ZIVA:
And where is that?

11:55.217 --> 11:56.565
Two decks down.

11:56.608 --> 11:57.565
Dogs found it.

11:57.608 --> 11:58.956
Micro-sensors on the robot

11:59.000 --> 12:00.304
sniffed the spectral
signature of

12:00.347 --> 12:01.391
explosive compounds.

12:01.434 --> 12:04.782
Who's he?
Public affairs
officer.

12:04.826 --> 12:08.217
You brought your publicist
with you? To a bomb threat?

12:08.260 --> 12:09.304
[scoffs]

12:09.347 --> 12:10.913
Can we talk?

12:10.956 --> 12:12.173
Little busy right now,
Agent DiNozzo.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.869
[whirring]
KELLY:
Got contact.

12:17.913 --> 12:19.565
I'll be standing by.

12:22.260 --> 12:24.478
TONY:
It's against the law
to lie to a federal officer.

12:24.521 --> 12:26.347
You want to change the statement
you gave us this morning?

12:26.391 --> 12:27.956
No.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.956
We know you weren't
alone last night.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.391
Really? Who
was I with?

12:31.434 --> 12:33.173
We don't know,
but we're gonna find out.

12:33.217 --> 12:35.565
KELLY:
Come on, just one more inch.

12:35.608 --> 12:36.695
Damn!

12:36.739 --> 12:37.956
It's hooked on

12:38.000 --> 12:39.217
the pressure release valve.

12:39.260 --> 12:41.043
I'm having trouble
getting it off.

12:41.086 --> 12:44.347
Enough with the toys,
Master Guns, let me go in.

12:44.391 --> 12:46.086
I'm giving it another shot,
Sergeant Dempsey.

12:47.869 --> 12:49.608
All right, come on.

12:49.652 --> 12:51.217
I'm suiting up.

12:51.260 --> 12:52.695
Go.

12:52.739 --> 12:54.173
I'm taking one more shot at it.

12:56.173 --> 12:59.000
[whirring]

13:01.043 --> 13:02.043
TONY:
What did I miss?

13:02.086 --> 13:03.130
ZIVA:
Nothing.

13:03.173 --> 13:04.739
It is still snagged.

13:04.782 --> 13:05.869
KELLY:
I'm gonna reposition the robot.

13:08.217 --> 13:11.130
If it had a motion sensor,
it would have gone off by now.

13:11.173 --> 13:13.391
KELLY: You have no idea
what's in there, Dempsey.

13:13.434 --> 13:14.869
HEATHER: Back the robot out;
I'm gonna need room.

13:15.782 --> 13:17.608
[whirring]

13:17.652 --> 13:18.869
KELLY: Backing it out.

13:18.913 --> 13:20.521
Don't say I didn't warn you.

13:23.086 --> 13:25.043
Robot clear and deactivated.

13:25.086 --> 13:27.652
Watch your six, Dempsey.

13:41.086 --> 13:43.130
Careful, Dempsey.

13:50.826 --> 13:53.000
KELLY:
Are you clear to release it?

13:53.043 --> 13:54.478
Affirmative.

13:54.521 --> 13:58.130
I'm taking it off
the pressure relief valve now.

14:00.565 --> 14:03.130
See? No problem.

14:03.173 --> 14:04.782
Let's get it
to the containment vessel.

14:04.826 --> 14:05.782
I'm here.

14:05.826 --> 14:07.260
I'll just disarm it now.

14:07.304 --> 14:09.739
Don't be stupid.

14:09.782 --> 14:11.000
Just gonna take a look inside.

14:12.739 --> 14:14.913
Gutsy.

14:14.956 --> 14:16.608
Or crazy.

14:16.652 --> 14:17.608
What do we got?

14:17.652 --> 14:19.521
[sighs]

14:19.565 --> 14:21.217
Trouble.

14:21.260 --> 14:22.565
There's a timer.

14:22.608 --> 14:23.478
I'm out of here.

14:26.217 --> 14:27.478
[groans]

14:29.695 --> 14:32.000
[alarms ringing,
steps clattering on stairs]

14:36.217 --> 14:37.478
Dempsey!

14:40.347 --> 14:41.347
[grunts]

14:41.391 --> 14:42.652
She all right?
Get a corpsman!

14:42.695 --> 14:43.782
Yes, Sergeant.

14:45.521 --> 14:46.695
Dempsey.
[sighs]

14:46.739 --> 14:47.913
You okay?

14:47.956 --> 14:49.652
You were right.

14:49.695 --> 14:51.000
That was stupid.

15:09.043 --> 15:10.782
DiNozzo and David?

15:10.826 --> 15:12.391
McGEE:
Just called
from the infirmary.

15:12.434 --> 15:13.826
Sergeant Dempsey's
gonna be okay.

15:13.869 --> 15:16.608
They're keeping her overnight
for observation.

15:16.652 --> 15:19.826
Apparently, the bomb
was more flash than bang.

15:19.869 --> 15:22.043
Someone's making a statement.

15:22.086 --> 15:24.000
Special Agent Krone's
problem now, not ours.

15:30.913 --> 15:34.130
Got something on your mind, Tim?

15:36.565 --> 15:39.826
I eliminated every cell phone
that was in use during the time

15:39.869 --> 15:41.043
Dempsey called 911.

15:41.086 --> 15:42.782
Every cell phone

15:42.826 --> 15:43.782
except one.

15:43.826 --> 15:44.782
Mm-hmm.

15:44.826 --> 15:47.000
Got a name?

15:47.043 --> 15:48.000
No.

15:48.043 --> 15:50.521
And it's not going to be easy.

15:50.565 --> 15:53.565
Spit it out, McGee.

15:53.608 --> 15:57.130
It's a secure phone,
registered to the FBI.

16:06.869 --> 16:08.434
[hoofbeats, gunfire over TV]

16:21.956 --> 16:23.913
Supposed to be here
an hour ago.

16:23.956 --> 16:26.173
My daughter had a performance
at school, I told you.

16:26.217 --> 16:28.565
Be nice to me.

16:28.608 --> 16:30.869
I just spent two hours
with our ex-wife.

16:30.913 --> 16:32.565
Yeah, she
mention my name?

16:32.608 --> 16:35.347
Not for years.

16:35.391 --> 16:37.086
Hey, you shaved
your beard.

16:37.130 --> 16:38.565
That's very observant.

16:41.043 --> 16:42.608
What is that?

16:42.652 --> 16:43.565
It's rice.

16:45.739 --> 16:47.434
[turns off TV]

16:47.478 --> 16:50.739
I thought you were
picking up cheeseburgers.

16:50.782 --> 16:53.608
It's lamb curry
from the Punjab Express.

16:53.652 --> 16:55.826
We both agreed we
hate that place.

16:55.869 --> 16:58.434
We did, but I got
a twofer coupon in the mail.

16:58.478 --> 17:02.521
Well, did you order
it spicy or mild?

17:02.565 --> 17:03.478
Atomic.

17:12.826 --> 17:14.304
[sniffs]

17:19.173 --> 17:21.130
So whose cell phone was it?

17:21.173 --> 17:24.173
Why do you need to know?

17:26.347 --> 17:28.217
Home-invasion robbery.

17:28.260 --> 17:30.695
A Marine shot an intruder.

17:30.739 --> 17:33.739
Whoever had that cell phone
was there.

17:33.782 --> 17:35.521
Doesn't sound right.

17:38.869 --> 17:40.434
Marine's female.

17:40.478 --> 17:41.652
Attractive.

17:41.695 --> 17:45.130
He was with her
at 2:00 in the morning.

17:45.173 --> 17:46.869
She's covering for him.

17:46.913 --> 17:47.739
An affair?

17:47.782 --> 17:49.260
No way.

17:54.739 --> 17:56.608
Who is he?

18:01.304 --> 18:03.173
The guy's high up in the Bureau.

18:03.217 --> 18:06.739
Way above
our pay grade, Jethro.

18:06.782 --> 18:08.869
Only did one field tour.

18:08.913 --> 18:10.695
Worked his way up
through the bureaucracy

18:10.739 --> 18:12.565
to the highest levels
of the FBI.

18:12.608 --> 18:14.869
He's as straight-arrow
as they come.

18:14.913 --> 18:16.347
Give me his name, will you?

18:17.521 --> 18:19.304
Gary Tolin.

18:21.130 --> 18:22.652
Executive assistant director

18:22.695 --> 18:24.956
of the Criminal Investigations
Division.

18:38.739 --> 18:40.521
Got another cereal bowl?

18:43.956 --> 18:46.434
Guns usually speak to me.

18:46.478 --> 18:48.695
They tell me
what I need to know.

18:48.739 --> 18:51.000
You, sir, are not cooperating.

18:51.043 --> 18:53.217
This is getting scary.

18:53.260 --> 18:54.565
Dr. Mallard talks to the dead,

18:54.608 --> 18:56.304
and now you're talking
to evidence.

18:56.347 --> 18:57.869
Never mind.

18:57.913 --> 18:59.304
Well, it usually
works with firearms.

18:59.347 --> 19:01.478
This one's just
not saying a peep.

19:01.521 --> 19:02.739
Well, the gun's owner
is talking.

19:02.782 --> 19:05.347
Uh, sort of.
We need your help.

19:05.391 --> 19:08.608
Well, I need a break.

19:08.652 --> 19:10.304
You, don't go anywhere.

19:10.347 --> 19:12.260
What do you need?Okay, we know the intruder

19:12.304 --> 19:14.869
had a liver transplant
between 15 and 20 years ago.

19:14.913 --> 19:17.043
So I'm not sure how complete
your older databases are,

19:17.086 --> 19:18.347
but could you...

19:18.391 --> 19:21.652
Run a computer search
of the transplant list

19:21.695 --> 19:22.652
and narrow it down?

19:22.695 --> 19:23.869
What do you have so far?

19:23.913 --> 19:25.086
Let's see here.

19:25.130 --> 19:26.956
Male, Caucasian,
approximately 55.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.304
73 inches tall,
green eyes, brown hair,

19:29.347 --> 19:31.043
blood-type A-positive.

19:31.086 --> 19:33.043
And, at one point in his life,
fractured his L5 vertebrae.

19:33.086 --> 19:34.260
Okay, I'm on it.

19:34.304 --> 19:35.173
Mm-hmm.

19:36.608 --> 19:38.043
Bye.

19:39.130 --> 19:41.086
Go away.
What?

19:41.130 --> 19:42.565
Back to the
duck pond.
Right.

19:50.086 --> 19:53.173
GIBBS:
You weren't alone, Sergeant.

19:53.217 --> 19:54.826
Really?

19:54.869 --> 19:56.826
Your people
keep telling me that.

19:56.869 --> 19:58.478
Who was I with?

19:58.521 --> 20:01.478
GIBBS:
Executive Assistant Director
Gary Tolin of the FBI.

20:03.478 --> 20:05.043
What was going on?

20:05.086 --> 20:06.782
DEMPSEY:
What do you think was going on?

20:06.826 --> 20:08.391
I'm tired of the
games, Sergeant.

20:08.434 --> 20:10.391
Answer the question.

20:13.391 --> 20:17.869
He was speaking at a seminar
on terrorist threat assessment.

20:17.913 --> 20:19.391
We met at the cocktail hour
afterwards.

20:19.434 --> 20:21.434
Started talking, hit it off.

20:21.478 --> 20:25.434
Found him sort of cute.

20:25.478 --> 20:27.043
I invited him back to my place.

20:29.173 --> 20:30.086
For coffee.

20:32.217 --> 20:33.869
How detailed
do you want me to get?

20:33.913 --> 20:36.086
We're consenting adults.

20:36.130 --> 20:38.565
His being there had nothing
to do with the robbery.

20:38.608 --> 20:40.782
After I shot the guy,
Gary panicked,

20:40.826 --> 20:42.391
told me he was married.

20:42.434 --> 20:45.086
Told him to go home.

20:45.130 --> 20:46.782
I'd cover.

20:46.826 --> 20:49.608
That was it.

20:49.652 --> 20:51.130
GIBBS:
We already gave you
an opportunity...

20:51.173 --> 20:53.565
Can I talk to you outside?

20:59.826 --> 21:01.043
[door closes]

21:01.086 --> 21:03.826
Eh, I don't buy it.

21:03.869 --> 21:04.826
What?

21:04.869 --> 21:06.826
Them.

21:06.869 --> 21:09.826
Her with him.

21:09.869 --> 21:10.956
She's young, hot...

21:11.000 --> 21:11.956
[chuckles]

21:12.000 --> 21:14.043
...Marine bomb tech.

21:14.086 --> 21:15.391
He's an old suit.

21:15.434 --> 21:19.391
Well, I find certain
older men...

21:19.434 --> 21:22.217
attractive.

21:22.260 --> 21:23.391
I don't like
being embarrassed

21:23.434 --> 21:25.478
in front of NCIS
agents, Fornell.

21:25.521 --> 21:28.652
Sir, they're
investigating
a death.

21:28.695 --> 21:32.608
You were a witness,
and you didn't
report it.

21:32.652 --> 21:34.347
My being at her house
had nothing to do

21:34.391 --> 21:37.043
with the robbery
or the shooting.

21:37.086 --> 21:40.000
It was a stupid
indiscretion,

21:40.043 --> 21:43.043
which I hope will be kept
from the Bureau and my wife.

21:43.086 --> 21:44.086
[door opening]

21:47.652 --> 21:49.478
Tell Special Agent Gibbs

21:49.521 --> 21:52.739
I will cooperate fully
with the investigation.

21:52.782 --> 21:54.608
But I'd appreciate it
if all communications

21:54.652 --> 21:56.043
would go through you.

21:56.086 --> 21:57.739
I'll pass that along.

21:57.782 --> 21:59.347
ABBY:
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

21:59.391 --> 22:00.347
[bell dings]Come on. Come on.

22:00.391 --> 22:02.478
[both grunt]
Palmer.

22:02.521 --> 22:03.652
You-you said you
had something.

22:03.695 --> 22:05.478
I do.
Well, I said
we'd be right up.

22:05.521 --> 22:06.913
Well, I know, but
it couldn't wait.

22:06.956 --> 22:08.521
I just wanted to show
you what I found

22:08.565 --> 22:09.695
before we go to Gibbs.

22:09.739 --> 22:11.173
The computer results are in.

22:11.217 --> 22:13.826
Okay. Between 1995 and 2000,

22:13.869 --> 22:16.782
18,212 people
had liver transplants

22:16.826 --> 22:18.260
in the
United States.

22:18.304 --> 22:20.869
Of those,
10,014 were male.

22:20.913 --> 22:24.652
Now, if we factor in
the deceased's race,

22:24.695 --> 22:27.391
blood type, age, height,
hair and eye color,

22:27.434 --> 22:30.695
our possibilities
have now shrunk to 116 men.

22:30.739 --> 22:32.434
Of those, only three

22:32.478 --> 22:33.869
had a fractured vertebrae.

22:33.913 --> 22:35.565
She's done most
of the agents' work for them.

22:35.608 --> 22:37.521
Oh, no. I've done all of it.

22:37.565 --> 22:39.565
Of the remaining three,

22:39.608 --> 22:41.391
one died in 1997.

22:41.434 --> 22:43.826
One of them is in a nursing home
in Peoria.

22:43.869 --> 22:46.652
And, ta-dah, our winner
is Glover Reese,

22:46.695 --> 22:48.347
formerly of Baltimore, Maryland.

22:50.913 --> 22:53.000
McGEE:
Current address unknown.

22:53.043 --> 22:55.043
GIBBS:
It's definitely the same guy.

22:55.086 --> 22:57.391
Well, this Baltimore
mug shot was taken in 1980,

22:57.434 --> 22:59.173
before files
were digitized.

22:59.217 --> 23:02.304
Explains why we didn't get a hit
on facial recognition.

23:02.347 --> 23:03.347
What do we know
about him?

23:03.391 --> 23:04.478
He was born in 1952

23:04.521 --> 23:06.391
on a small farm in Maryland.

23:06.434 --> 23:08.130
Moved to Baltimore
as a teenager.

23:08.173 --> 23:09.347
Quite a juvenile record.

23:09.391 --> 23:10.782
TONY:
Oh, that's for sure.

23:10.826 --> 23:12.782
In the '70s,
he had several busts.

23:12.826 --> 23:14.652
Petty theft,
assault and battery.

23:14.695 --> 23:17.565
And then, in '78,
he graduated to the big time.

23:17.608 --> 23:19.043
Attempted murder.

23:19.086 --> 23:21.043
Spent ten years
of a 15-year sentence at Jessup.

23:21.086 --> 23:22.608
Ironically,
he got his liver transplant

23:22.652 --> 23:24.521
while he was there,
courtesy of the state.

23:24.565 --> 23:25.739
We paid for that, right?

23:25.782 --> 23:27.260
Mm-hmm. A year
after his release,

23:27.304 --> 23:29.173
he stopped checking in
with his parole officer

23:29.217 --> 23:30.652
and disappeared.

23:30.695 --> 23:32.173
Never to be heard
from again.

23:32.217 --> 23:33.652
TONY:
Au contraire, boss.

23:33.695 --> 23:35.478
And this is the part I think
you're really going to love.

23:35.521 --> 23:37.043
His fingerprints were found

23:37.086 --> 23:39.478
at the scenes
of two unsolved murders.

23:39.521 --> 23:40.782
Good reason to have
your prints removed.

23:40.826 --> 23:41.782
Who'd he kill?

23:41.826 --> 23:43.173
TONY:
A union boss in Philly

23:43.217 --> 23:45.826
and a millionaire playboy
in Palm Beach.

23:45.869 --> 23:47.391
Both suspected
to be contract hits.

23:47.434 --> 23:48.826
Really?

23:48.869 --> 23:50.913
GIBBS:
Glover Reese wasn't a burglar.

23:52.391 --> 23:54.260
He was a hit man.

24:08.043 --> 24:09.391
[vehicle approaching]

24:19.043 --> 24:20.304
Checked with Tolin's
office again.

24:20.347 --> 24:21.739
They still haven't
heard from him,

24:21.782 --> 24:24.478
and his cell's
turned off.

24:24.521 --> 24:27.217
Find out if your Marine
lady had any enemies?

24:27.260 --> 24:28.782
DiNozzo's going
to talk to her.

24:28.826 --> 24:31.086
I'll bet the house
Tolin's the hit man's target.

24:31.130 --> 24:33.043
I'm not going to
take that bet.

24:33.086 --> 24:35.913
We at the FBI do tend
to piss people off.

24:35.956 --> 24:37.043
Whoever wants him
eliminate is

24:37.086 --> 24:38.347
just going to hire
somebody else.

24:38.391 --> 24:39.826
You got to put him
in protective custody.

24:39.869 --> 24:41.217
Well, you got to
find him first.

24:41.260 --> 24:42.652
Excuse me.
Mrs. Tolin?

24:42.695 --> 24:43.913
Yes.

24:43.956 --> 24:45.956
Agent Fornell.

24:46.000 --> 24:49.000
Special Agent
Gibbs, NCIS.

24:49.043 --> 24:50.478
We're looking for
your husband.

24:50.521 --> 24:51.913
Is he at home?

24:51.956 --> 24:53.304
No.

24:53.347 --> 24:55.260
Any idea where
we can find him?

24:55.304 --> 24:57.608
He came home a couple hours ago,
packed a bag and rushed off.

24:57.652 --> 24:59.347
Said it was Bureau business.

24:59.391 --> 25:01.913
Told me he might
be gone a couple days.

25:01.956 --> 25:03.521
Did he say where he was going?

25:03.565 --> 25:05.130
Are either of you married?

25:06.478 --> 25:08.130
No.

25:08.173 --> 25:10.043
Divorced, huh?

25:11.217 --> 25:12.826
Well, I don't know
how it was

25:12.869 --> 25:14.130
in your marriages,

25:14.173 --> 25:16.695
but I've been a Bureau wife
for 23 years,

25:16.739 --> 25:19.826
and Gary either can't
or won't tell me about his work.

25:19.869 --> 25:21.782
I have no idea where he went.

25:21.826 --> 25:23.695
Well, if you
hear from him,

25:23.739 --> 25:25.086
would you have
him give me call?

25:26.434 --> 25:28.043
The FBI doesn't know
where he is?

25:30.391 --> 25:32.434
Is something wrong?

25:32.478 --> 25:33.434
We're not sure.

25:33.478 --> 25:34.652
But just to be safe,

25:34.695 --> 25:36.260
I'm going to
have agents

25:36.304 --> 25:37.782
stationed outside
the house.

25:37.826 --> 25:39.695
Now you're scaring me.

25:40.913 --> 25:42.956
I'm going to make
some phone calls,

25:43.000 --> 25:45.869
see if Tolin
is on "Bureau business."

25:45.913 --> 25:48.695
Think she knows he
was fooling around?

25:48.739 --> 25:51.695
If she doesn't know,
Tobias, she suspects.

25:56.130 --> 25:57.391
Hey, Ron.

25:57.434 --> 25:59.043
It's, uh, Tony DiNozzo.

25:59.086 --> 26:00.434
Listen,
I've been looking through

26:00.478 --> 26:03.000
the pictures that you sent,
and, uh, I don't know--

26:03.043 --> 26:04.565
I... I can't put
my finger on it,

26:04.608 --> 26:05.826
but there's something off.

26:05.869 --> 26:07.695
Think I'd like to talk
to you about it.

26:07.739 --> 26:11.000
Uh, give me a call
when you get a chance. Thanks.

26:13.913 --> 26:15.217
Hey, Sergeant.

26:15.260 --> 26:16.391
How you feeling?

26:16.434 --> 26:17.478
Okay.

26:17.521 --> 26:19.043
This official business,

26:19.086 --> 26:21.652
or did I get a reputation this
morning as an easy hookup?

26:21.695 --> 26:23.565
We identified the man you shot.

26:23.608 --> 26:25.434
He's wanted for two
unsolved murders.

26:27.086 --> 26:28.695
So, what, you're here
to give me a medal?

26:30.782 --> 26:32.739
Well, he wasn't a burglar.

26:32.782 --> 26:34.391
He was a contract killer.

26:41.826 --> 26:43.739
You have any enemies?

26:43.782 --> 26:47.086
None that
want me dead.

26:47.130 --> 26:49.782
Well, you got off duty at 1600.
Where you been?

26:49.826 --> 26:51.521
I was having dinner
with my brother.

26:51.565 --> 26:52.956
Want his number?

26:54.391 --> 26:57.043
We may have to put you
under protective custody.

26:57.086 --> 26:59.608
This has got to be about
my friend at the FBI,

26:59.652 --> 27:01.652
not me.

27:01.695 --> 27:03.434
We're working that angle.

27:05.956 --> 27:08.000
But I'm not buying
your story.

27:08.043 --> 27:12.391
I mean, of course, I understand
why Tolin was turned on,

27:12.434 --> 27:15.260
but why were you attracted
to him?

27:15.304 --> 27:18.739
You an expert in these things?As a matter of fact, I am.

27:18.782 --> 27:20.086
I've always had a
father complex.

27:23.217 --> 27:24.869
We through?

27:24.913 --> 27:27.043
I've had a
tough day.

27:34.043 --> 27:35.304
Morning, Ziva.

27:35.347 --> 27:37.217
Morning.

27:37.260 --> 27:38.782
ZIVA:
What is this?

27:38.826 --> 27:40.695
Downloaded the cases
Gary Tolin supervised

27:40.739 --> 27:43.000
over the past five years.

27:43.043 --> 27:45.000
Hopefully, we can find out
who wants him dead.

27:45.043 --> 27:46.000
GIBBS:
Of course, you
got permission

27:46.043 --> 27:50.521
to copy those files?

27:50.565 --> 27:52.826
There's an index at the front.

27:53.478 --> 27:55.913
Arlington police found
an abandoned, stolen car

27:55.956 --> 27:58.043
a couple blocks from
Sergeant Dempsey's house.

27:58.086 --> 27:59.521
You think our
hit man used it?

27:59.565 --> 28:01.739
Well, I think he had
to get there somehow,

28:01.782 --> 28:03.391
and it was hot-wired.

28:03.434 --> 28:05.913
Explains why he didn't
have any keys on him.

28:05.956 --> 28:07.304
It's just been towed into
our evidence garage.

28:07.347 --> 28:09.086
I found out

28:09.130 --> 28:11.304
Tolin is not
on Bureau business.

28:11.347 --> 28:14.521
Told the director he wanted
a couple personal days.

28:14.565 --> 28:15.347
TONY:
Oh. Tells the
Bureau one thing

28:15.391 --> 28:18.130
and his wife another.

28:18.173 --> 28:20.391
Boss, obviously, my gut
is not in your league,

28:20.434 --> 28:21.652
but it tells me
that Tolin

28:21.695 --> 28:22.826
and Heather Dempsey
are hiding something.

28:22.869 --> 28:24.000
It's more than just
a one-night stand.

28:24.043 --> 28:25.434
[computer trilling]Whoa.

28:25.478 --> 28:27.043
This is a load of cases.

28:27.086 --> 28:28.652
TONY:
Public corruption,
civil rights,

28:28.695 --> 28:30.565
organized crime,
drugs, kidnapping.

28:30.608 --> 28:32.000
Tolin's an EAD.

28:32.043 --> 28:33.391
He's got his hands
in everything.

28:33.434 --> 28:34.782
ZIVA:
This could take forever.

28:34.826 --> 28:35.869
Tolin is one of yours.

28:35.913 --> 28:36.956
Why isn't the FBI doing this?

28:37.000 --> 28:38.130
Hey, until we
know more,

28:38.173 --> 28:40.956
we're running things from here.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.173
[phone ringing]

28:43.217 --> 28:45.478
Yeah. Gibbs.

28:47.130 --> 28:47.826
GIBBS: Mm-hmm.

28:47.869 --> 28:49.391
Be right down.

28:53.956 --> 28:56.086
[grunts]

28:59.521 --> 29:00.739
Gibbs is on his way down.

29:00.782 --> 29:02.304
You want to meet him
at the elevator?

29:02.347 --> 29:03.391
Uh, you go ahead.

29:03.434 --> 29:04.869
What are you doing?

29:04.913 --> 29:06.956
I am anticipating
Gibbs' next move.

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
You're such a chess player.

29:11.130 --> 29:12.695
Well, hello, Abby.

29:12.739 --> 29:14.434
You've only had the car
for ten minutes.

29:14.478 --> 29:15.869
That's fast, even for you.

29:15.913 --> 29:18.565
I found this camera
under the front seat of the car.

29:22.347 --> 29:24.043
Sergeant Dempsey was
the target, boss,

29:24.086 --> 29:25.478
not Tolin.

29:25.521 --> 29:26.782
Get her in here.

29:26.826 --> 29:28.739
I've been tracking
Dempsey's cell,

29:28.782 --> 29:31.434
and she is in McLean, Virginia,
about six miles from her place.

29:31.478 --> 29:33.130
Well, call her.

29:37.565 --> 29:40.347
[line ringing]

29:42.826 --> 29:45.217
She just turned her
cell phone off.

29:45.260 --> 29:47.173
Must have seen
our caller I.D.

29:47.217 --> 29:49.173
Where in McLean?

29:56.913 --> 29:58.391
Howard Rehabilitation Center.

30:04.260 --> 30:05.347
McGee, go on.

30:05.391 --> 30:06.608
Take Ziva with you.

30:06.652 --> 30:07.869
Where are we going?

30:07.913 --> 30:08.913
To find Sergeant Dempsey.

30:08.956 --> 30:10.434
Hey.

30:10.478 --> 30:12.652
Amigo, we bet
on the wrong horse.

30:12.695 --> 30:15.130
That hit man
was after my Marine,

30:15.173 --> 30:17.086
not your EAD.

30:17.130 --> 30:19.695
That doesn't explain
why Tolin's off the grid.

30:19.739 --> 30:22.130
I'm telling you,
those two are up to something.

30:24.913 --> 30:26.478
ZIVA:
Excuse me.

30:26.521 --> 30:27.826
I wonder if you
could help us.

30:27.869 --> 30:28.913
I'll try.

30:28.956 --> 30:30.565
Uh, we're looking
for this person,

30:30.608 --> 30:32.739
and I thought she might be here.

30:32.782 --> 30:34.695
Heather. You just missed her.

30:34.739 --> 30:36.739
You know her.

30:36.782 --> 30:38.130
She comes almost every day
to visit her brother.

30:38.173 --> 30:39.391
Her brother?

30:39.434 --> 30:40.434
Judd Dempsey.

30:43.478 --> 30:45.000
Thanks.

30:47.739 --> 30:49.391
Pardon us.

30:49.434 --> 30:50.695
Uh, Judd?

30:50.739 --> 30:51.869
Yeah.

30:51.913 --> 30:53.086
Hi. NCIS.

30:53.130 --> 30:54.956
Agents McGee and David.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.260
We're looking
for your sister.

30:57.304 --> 30:58.826
Got to be about
the burglar she shot.

30:58.869 --> 31:00.391
Yeah, she told you, huh?

31:00.434 --> 31:02.869
This has really been
a crazy year for us with guns.

31:02.913 --> 31:04.260
What do you mean?

31:04.304 --> 31:06.652
Heather kills a thief,
and I get shot in the back.

31:08.391 --> 31:09.913
That's why I'm in this.

31:09.956 --> 31:11.869
What happened?

31:11.913 --> 31:14.434
I was in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

31:16.304 --> 31:18.652
I got caught in the crossfire
of a drug turf war

31:18.695 --> 31:20.173
between rival gangs
in Southeast DC.

31:24.913 --> 31:26.347
Judd Dempsey was an
innocent bystander.

31:26.391 --> 31:28.043
Now he's paralyzed
from the chest down.

31:28.086 --> 31:29.913
He was working at a
Fourth Street homeless shelter.

31:29.956 --> 31:31.347
He's a really sweet kid.

31:31.391 --> 31:32.565
They are very close.

31:32.608 --> 31:34.043
Dempsey was in Afghanistan
when it happened.

31:34.086 --> 31:35.695
Get the shooter?

31:35.739 --> 31:36.739
Yes, they did.

31:36.782 --> 31:38.347
McGEE:
Gene Abbott.

31:38.391 --> 31:39.304
It's a local dealer.

31:39.347 --> 31:41.000
After his arrest,

31:41.043 --> 31:43.913
he cooperated, named names,
was granted immunity

31:43.956 --> 31:46.521
and given a new identity
by the Justice Department.

31:46.565 --> 31:48.000
Guess who
recommended the deal.

31:49.695 --> 31:51.739
TONY:
Everybody's favorite
FBI Executive

31:51.782 --> 31:54.173
Assistant Director,
Gary P. Tolin.

31:54.217 --> 31:56.391
ZIVA:
More than just
a one-night stand, huh?

31:56.434 --> 31:58.913
Heather Dempsey? Come on.

31:58.956 --> 32:00.913
You guys know what this
is-- it's Body Heat.

32:00.956 --> 32:02.391
The 1981 classic

32:02.434 --> 32:04.956
with William Hurt
and Kathleen Turner.

32:05.000 --> 32:06.826
Boss, as much as I hate
Tony's movie analogies,

32:06.869 --> 32:08.695
I think he's right on
with this one.

32:08.739 --> 32:10.043
Heather Dempsey wanted revenge.

32:10.086 --> 32:12.000
She needed Abbott's
new identity.

32:12.043 --> 32:14.391
She didn't bump into Tolin
at the seminar by chance.

32:14.434 --> 32:16.130
She went there looking for him,

32:16.173 --> 32:18.391
and then she
Kathleen-Turnered
on the body heat

32:18.434 --> 32:20.304
and got him back
to her place.

32:20.347 --> 32:21.695
McGEE:
More than once.

32:21.739 --> 32:23.043
She lied to us.

32:23.086 --> 32:24.391
They met
before the seminar.

32:24.434 --> 32:25.826
I checked Tolin's
cell phone history.

32:25.869 --> 32:28.000
He was at Dempsey's residence

32:28.043 --> 32:29.739
several times
over the last two weeks.

32:29.782 --> 32:31.956
TONY:
Heather seduced the new
name and identity from him.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.260
That's why Tolin's been
acting so squirrelly.

32:39.043 --> 32:40.913
Heather Dempsey's
gonna kill Abbott.

32:48.130 --> 32:51.347
ZIVA: Sergeant Dempsey's team
leader has not heard from her.

32:51.391 --> 32:53.391
Put out a BOLO on her
and her truck.

32:53.434 --> 32:54.434
Got nothing.

32:54.478 --> 32:55.695
Her phone's still off.

32:55.739 --> 32:57.695
Obviously she doesn't
want to be found.

32:57.739 --> 33:00.521
You think Abbott hired
the hit man to kill her?

33:00.565 --> 33:02.913
He would if he found out
she was looking for him.

33:02.956 --> 33:04.130
[phone rings]

33:04.173 --> 33:05.695
Yeah, it's Gibbs.

33:05.739 --> 33:08.652
Mm-hmm. I'll be right up.

33:08.695 --> 33:10.608
Let's go. You're
with me, poster boy.

33:10.652 --> 33:12.347
[chuckles]

33:18.695 --> 33:19.956
Tobias, what do you got?

33:25.130 --> 33:28.478
I apologize for disappearing,
Agent Gibbs.

33:28.521 --> 33:32.782
I... I needed some time
to sort some things out.

33:32.826 --> 33:35.130
You want to tell us
what really happened

33:35.173 --> 33:37.347
between you
and Heather Dempsey?

33:37.391 --> 33:41.347
I wouldn't admit it at the time,
but I let myself be used.

33:41.391 --> 33:44.869
I should have known
something was wrong.

33:44.913 --> 33:48.521
A woman like Heather
coming on to me?

33:48.565 --> 33:50.521
All she really wanted
was information.

33:50.565 --> 33:53.043
Gene Abbott's new
name and location.

33:53.086 --> 33:54.043
You gave it to her.

33:56.173 --> 33:58.434
I wasn't thinking...
clearly.

34:00.608 --> 34:02.304
Abbott's living on a farm
in Eldersburg, Maryland.

34:02.347 --> 34:04.478
Agent Gibbs, I
want you to know

34:04.521 --> 34:07.391
that I'm preparing a letter
of resignation detailing

34:07.434 --> 34:09.043
everything that's happened.

34:09.086 --> 34:11.652
It will be on the director's
desk by the end of the day.

34:13.826 --> 34:16.130
I'm not excusing
what I've done, but...

34:16.173 --> 34:20.086
Heather did say that she just
wanted to confront Abbott.

34:20.130 --> 34:22.086
And you believe that.

34:39.695 --> 34:42.086
[horse neighs, dog barking]

34:47.000 --> 34:49.739
That's her pickup right there.

34:51.739 --> 34:52.956
Check the house.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.695
ABBOTT:
This is just way out of
control! You're crazy!

35:04.739 --> 35:07.217
DEMPSEY:
What, you're not
enjoying yourself?

35:07.260 --> 35:08.434
You look like hell.

35:08.478 --> 35:10.434
I can't take
this anymore.

35:10.478 --> 35:13.260
HEATHER:
Then you know what to do.

35:13.304 --> 35:15.217
Make a sharp move, Gene.

35:15.260 --> 35:17.391
It'll all be over.

35:21.260 --> 35:23.608
But you can't do it

35:23.652 --> 35:25.260
'cause you're a coward.

35:27.913 --> 35:29.913
You ratted out your homies
just to stay out of jail.

35:31.869 --> 35:34.173
I'll put you out
of your misery...

35:36.043 --> 35:37.000
when I'm ready.

35:42.695 --> 35:43.826
You guys are good.

35:43.869 --> 35:49.434
[whimpering]:
Help! She... she's sick!

35:49.478 --> 35:52.913
This thing, it has
a motion sensor.

35:52.956 --> 35:53.782
If I move, I'm dead!

36:00.217 --> 36:02.739
So how long has she been here?

36:02.782 --> 36:04.304
A couple days.

36:09.086 --> 36:12.086
Boss, I can call the
bomb squad if you need.

36:12.130 --> 36:13.956
I don't know.

36:15.956 --> 36:18.913
We got our own EOD tech
right here.

36:22.130 --> 36:24.695
Call the bomb squad!

36:24.739 --> 36:26.652
Gonna have to answer
some questions first.

36:28.304 --> 36:29.652
What?

36:34.217 --> 36:36.130
You put out a contract
on Sergeant Dempsey?

36:46.260 --> 36:47.478
What's the blast radius?

36:47.521 --> 36:50.565
About 15, 20 feet.

36:52.130 --> 36:54.565
See, I understand
if you're reluctant to answer.

36:54.608 --> 36:57.652
You probably want to talk
to your lawyer first.

36:57.695 --> 37:00.565
Yeah. We could, uh, get you one
by tomorrow morning.

37:00.608 --> 37:02.565
Although, for a good one,
that's gonna take a couple days.

37:11.086 --> 37:14.652
All right... all right.

37:14.695 --> 37:16.608
"All right" what?

37:18.652 --> 37:19.956
I put the hit out.

37:23.304 --> 37:24.869
Now get this thing off me!

37:24.913 --> 37:26.782
I want to make sure
you don't feel coerced,

37:26.826 --> 37:29.608
that you're volunteering
this information.

37:29.652 --> 37:33.086
It was done in self-defense.

37:33.130 --> 37:34.652
Explain.

37:34.695 --> 37:37.000
A neighbor said
she'd been nosing around.

37:39.260 --> 37:40.782
He took down
her license number.

37:42.695 --> 37:44.652
When I found out who she was...

37:44.695 --> 37:46.217
You decided to get

37:46.260 --> 37:47.652
Sergeant Dempsey
before she got you.

37:47.695 --> 37:49.000
How'd that work out for ya?

37:53.000 --> 37:54.347
Heather,

37:54.391 --> 37:56.260
you don't want
to ruin your life

37:56.304 --> 37:58.260
for this guy.

38:03.130 --> 38:04.782
[gasps]

38:06.695 --> 38:07.869
Go on.

38:07.913 --> 38:09.347
Take it off.

38:09.391 --> 38:10.565
You can do it.

38:10.608 --> 38:12.130
It's a fake.

38:15.478 --> 38:18.043
Yeah, I wanted
him to suffer.

38:18.086 --> 38:21.130
To feel a little bit
of what my brother
feels every day.

38:21.173 --> 38:24.608
Stuck in a chair.

38:24.652 --> 38:26.043
Constant pain.

38:26.086 --> 38:28.521
Unable to do the simplest
things without help.

38:30.086 --> 38:31.347
At the mercy of others.

38:38.521 --> 38:43.304
[whistling
Italian aria]

38:44.782 --> 38:46.043
Italian?

38:46.086 --> 38:49.086
Si. Pasta puttanesca.

38:49.130 --> 38:50.304
My nonna'srecipe.

38:50.347 --> 38:52.826
Wait till I'm done.

38:52.869 --> 38:55.695
It's good. What's
the occasion?

38:55.739 --> 38:58.608
I'm trying to curry favor.

39:02.347 --> 39:06.043
Gene Abbott was charged
with conspiracy to commit.

39:06.086 --> 39:07.304
Well, criminals are stupid.

39:08.739 --> 39:11.043
He didn't realize
that the new crime

39:11.086 --> 39:13.782
wasn't covered by his immunity?

39:13.826 --> 39:16.130
What're you going to do
about Sergeant Dempsey?

39:16.173 --> 39:17.695
Me? Nothing.
She's a hero

39:17.739 --> 39:19.260
as far as I'm concerned.

39:19.304 --> 39:22.521
The ATF doesn't see it that way.

39:22.565 --> 39:25.043
They're debating
which charges to file:

39:25.086 --> 39:27.043
kidnapping, assault,

39:27.086 --> 39:28.521
threat of bodily harm.

39:28.565 --> 39:31.782
[chuckles]
The bomb was
bogus, Tobias.

39:31.826 --> 39:33.000
Hey!

39:34.652 --> 39:36.478
Good luck finding a jury
that will convict.

39:40.000 --> 39:41.782
You gonna wash up?

39:47.478 --> 39:49.260
What is he doing
here so early?

39:49.304 --> 39:51.043
He has not beaten me
in over a month.

39:51.086 --> 39:53.565
I don't know.

39:53.608 --> 39:55.086
Mid-year reviews
aren't till December.

39:55.130 --> 39:56.391
Tony...

39:56.434 --> 39:58.086
what's going on?

39:58.130 --> 40:00.260
For your information,

40:00.304 --> 40:02.260
the recruitment brochure is
going to the printer today.

40:02.304 --> 40:05.260
Ron Sands is up
with the Director right now

40:05.304 --> 40:06.652
getting the mockup
approved.

40:06.695 --> 40:08.695
It's a big day.

40:08.739 --> 40:11.521
And, um, if you guys would
like autographed copies

40:11.565 --> 40:14.304
of the brochure,
I can arrange that.

40:14.347 --> 40:15.956
Here he comes.

40:17.086 --> 40:18.260
Hey, Ron.
Oh.

40:18.304 --> 40:19.739
Hey, so, uh,

40:19.782 --> 40:21.391
what'd the director
have to say?

40:21.434 --> 40:24.478
He was very pleased.
It looks beautiful. So, good.

40:24.521 --> 40:26.652
Use the shot of me at my desk
on the cover?

40:26.695 --> 40:28.043
No.

40:28.086 --> 40:30.739
Oh, I know,

40:30.782 --> 40:32.782
one of the ones
from aboard the ship.

40:32.826 --> 40:34.913
That was your idea, too.

40:34.956 --> 40:37.000
It was my idea, but we
didn't use that one either.

40:37.043 --> 40:39.043
Oh. Abby's lab?

40:39.086 --> 40:41.173
No.

40:41.217 --> 40:42.913
Shooting range?

40:42.956 --> 40:44.913
Uh...

40:44.956 --> 40:46.434
Break room?

40:46.478 --> 40:48.217
No.

40:48.260 --> 40:50.043
Which one did you use?

40:51.347 --> 40:53.478
The director
wanted the image

40:53.521 --> 40:55.434
of NCIS to be
one of authority...

40:57.478 --> 40:59.652
and integrity.

41:01.347 --> 41:03.434
Leadership.

41:03.478 --> 41:04.739
Isn't that a piece
of your shoulder

41:04.782 --> 41:06.347
in the background, Tony?

41:08.000 --> 41:10.826
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it is.

41:10.869 --> 41:13.086
[laughs]
