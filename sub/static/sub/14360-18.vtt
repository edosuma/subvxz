Good night, honey.

Good night.

(gasps)

00:33.826 --> 00:35.995
Oh, honey, please not tonight.

What do

01:15.951 --> 01:17.578
you think?

01:17.619 --> 01:20.581
More salt? More cilantro?

01:17.619 --> 01:20.581
A little zing of Tabasco?

01:20.622 --> 01:22.123
It's perfect.

01:22.165 --> 01:24.125
I can't taste anymore.

01:24.167 --> 01:25.419
Okay, dips--

01:25.460 --> 01:27.170
creamy, salsa,

01:25.460 --> 01:27.170
crab and compote.

01:27.212 --> 01:28.756
Chips--

01:28.797 --> 01:32.051
potato, corn, blue corn,

01:28.797 --> 01:32.051
sour cream and onion,

01:32.091 --> 01:35.804
salt and vinegar,

01:32.091 --> 01:35.804
kettle, and baked.

01:35.846 --> 01:37.848
How much did this table cost?

01:37.890 --> 01:39.391
Is this why I didn't

01:37.890 --> 01:39.391
get a birthday present?

01:39.433 --> 01:41.142
Hey, this is my first time

01:39.433 --> 01:41.142
hosting the poker game,

01:41.184 --> 01:43.854
and I want everything perfect

01:41.184 --> 01:43.854
when my friends come over.

01:43.896 --> 01:45.397
Or at least better

01:43.896 --> 01:45.397
than their stuff.

01:45.439 --> 01:46.565
Ooh, I almost forgot.

01:46.607 --> 01:48.149
Do you know Brian's daughter,

01:46.607 --> 01:48.149
Chandra?

01:48.191 --> 01:50.151
Of course.

01:48.191 --> 01:50.151
Yeah.

01:50.193 --> 01:51.528
Well, Brian's

01:50.193 --> 01:51.528
bringing her over tonight,

01:51.570 --> 01:52.988
and I think

01:51.570 --> 01:52.988
she's bringing a friend.

01:53.030 --> 01:53.822
Kristen?

01:53.864 --> 01:54.949
Uh, yeah, something.

01:54.990 --> 01:56.199
But Brian is playing poker.

01:56.241 --> 01:58.869
So I need you two

01:56.241 --> 01:58.869
to entertain them, understand?

01:58.911 --> 02:00.537
BOTH: Uh-huh.

01:58.911 --> 02:00.537
Now, I mean it, guys.

02:00.579 --> 02:02.163
I don't want you bothering us.

02:02.205 --> 02:04.458
I want you and those girls

02:02.205 --> 02:04.458
in your room all night

02:04.499 --> 02:05.459
with the door closed.

02:05.500 --> 02:06.794
Got it?

02:08.503 --> 02:10.171
There's your

02:08.503 --> 02:10.171
birthday present.

02:10.213 --> 02:12.132
DEWEY:

02:10.213 --> 02:12.132
Who's Chandra?

02:13.300 --> 02:15.594
She's no one to you.

02:13.300 --> 02:15.594
Understood?

02:15.636 --> 02:17.596
If you set one foot

02:15.636 --> 02:17.596
in our room tonight,

02:17.638 --> 02:19.180
you are dead.

02:19.222 --> 02:20.849
Where am I supposed to go?

02:20.891 --> 02:21.767
I don't care.

02:21.809 --> 02:23.184
But if I see you tonight,

02:23.226 --> 02:26.229
I will Charlie-horse

02:23.226 --> 02:26.229
every muscle in your body.

02:26.271 --> 02:28.189
But...

02:26.271 --> 02:28.189
It disturbs me

02:28.231 --> 02:29.566
how much

02:28.231 --> 02:29.566
I enjoyed that.

02:29.608 --> 02:31.652
Don't make me

02:29.608 --> 02:31.652
do it again.

02:32.903 --> 02:34.863
Hi, honey.

02:32.903 --> 02:34.863
Hello.

02:34.905 --> 02:36.197
You're working

02:34.905 --> 02:36.197
late tonight, right?

02:36.239 --> 02:37.491
Yeah, 10:30 at least.

02:37.532 --> 02:39.118
Okay, good.

02:37.532 --> 02:39.118
Something came up.

02:39.159 --> 02:40.786
I've got to have

02:39.159 --> 02:40.786
dinner with someone.

02:40.828 --> 02:41.703
Who?

02:40.828 --> 02:41.703
No one.

02:41.745 --> 02:42.997
I mean, it's just

02:43.038 --> 02:44.498
some old business

02:43.038 --> 02:44.498
I have to take care of

02:44.539 --> 02:46.583
and I don't really want

02:44.539 --> 02:46.583
to talk about it now, okay?

02:46.625 --> 02:47.918
Well, can I help?

02:47.960 --> 02:49.586
No, it's fine.

02:49.628 --> 02:51.212
I promise, I'll tell you

02:49.628 --> 02:51.212
everything when you get home.

02:51.254 --> 02:53.214
Okay.

02:51.254 --> 02:53.214
Thanks.

02:53.256 --> 02:55.174
Don't worry. He'll be gone

02:53.256 --> 02:55.174
by the time you get back.

02:59.262 --> 03:01.222
Did you catch

02:59.262 --> 03:01.222
that "he" part?

03:02.432 --> 03:03.475
MAN:

03:02.432 --> 03:03.475
Hi, Hal.

03:03.517 --> 03:05.019
Hey, Brian,

03:03.517 --> 03:05.019
how are you?

03:05.060 --> 03:06.812
They're here.

03:06.854 --> 03:07.938
Get out.

03:14.736 --> 03:15.696
Boys,

03:15.737 --> 03:16.697
I know you know Brian

03:16.738 --> 03:18.615
and I think you kids

03:16.738 --> 03:18.615
know each other.

03:18.657 --> 03:20.241
Yeah.

03:18.657 --> 03:20.241
No.

03:20.283 --> 03:22.077
Anyway, we're going to leave you

03:20.283 --> 03:22.077
kids to entertain yourselves.

03:22.119 --> 03:23.120
Yes, your

03:22.119 --> 03:23.120
father and I

03:23.162 --> 03:24.496
have to conduct

03:23.162 --> 03:24.496
some business.

03:24.538 --> 03:27.248
It seems that he has some

03:24.538 --> 03:27.248
of my money in his wallet.

03:27.290 --> 03:28.917
Bring it on.

03:27.290 --> 03:28.917
All right.

03:29.960 --> 03:31.628
May I take

03:29.960 --> 03:31.628
your wrap?

03:31.670 --> 03:34.255
Listen, just 'cause my dad

03:31.670 --> 03:34.255
dragged us to this dump

03:34.297 --> 03:36.257
doesn't mean we have

03:34.297 --> 03:36.257
to talk to you.

03:36.299 --> 03:37.258
Just show us

03:36.299 --> 03:37.258
where we can sit

03:37.300 --> 03:38.886
where we

03:37.300 --> 03:38.886
won't catch fleas.

03:39.887 --> 03:41.763
I'm gonna go see

03:39.887 --> 03:41.763
what Dewey's doing.

03:42.305 --> 03:43.306
Hey.

03:43.348 --> 03:44.892
(gasping)

03:44.933 --> 03:47.519
(loudly):

03:44.933 --> 03:47.519
Oh, you're Stevie,

03:47.561 --> 03:48.562
right?

03:48.603 --> 03:51.272
Can we help you in?

03:51.314 --> 03:53.567
I'm not...

03:53.608 --> 03:55.318
deaf.

03:55.360 --> 03:57.696
Did you hear

03:55.360 --> 03:57.696
him breathe?

03:57.738 --> 04:00.365
GIRLS:

03:57.738 --> 04:00.365
Aw...

04:00.407 --> 04:02.283
All right,

04:00.407 --> 04:02.283
did you hear the one

04:02.325 --> 04:04.285
about the astronaut

04:02.325 --> 04:04.285
and the hooker?

04:04.327 --> 04:05.662
Yeah.

04:05.704 --> 04:07.706
I didn't get it.

04:07.748 --> 04:11.168
Dewey, I told you to

04:07.748 --> 04:11.168
stay in your room.

04:07.748 --> 04:11.168
But Reese said...

04:11.210 --> 04:12.753
No, Dewey, this is man time.

04:12.794 --> 04:14.046
You can't be here.

04:15.005 --> 04:16.506
How's the dip?

04:18.175 --> 04:19.300
Hey, Hal, this is

04:19.342 --> 04:20.301
a sweet table.

04:20.343 --> 04:21.386
What is it,

04:20.343 --> 04:21.386
a 52-incher?

04:21.428 --> 04:22.554
Yes, sirree.

04:22.596 --> 04:25.182
Nice. I got the 54.

04:22.596 --> 04:25.182
Yeah, but

04:25.224 --> 04:27.726
you don't have the built-in

04:25.224 --> 04:27.726
drink holders like I do.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.686
Or the extra-padded leather

04:27.768 --> 04:29.686
around the edges like mine.

04:29.728 --> 04:31.312
You can play all night

04:31.354 --> 04:33.314
and not feel it in

04:31.354 --> 04:33.314
your wrists the next day.

04:33.356 --> 04:35.358
Oh, but this is nice,

04:33.356 --> 04:35.358
too, Hal.

04:33.356 --> 04:35.358
Sweet.

04:35.400 --> 04:36.651
Sweet.

04:35.400 --> 04:36.651
(men laughing)

04:39.446 --> 04:41.573
Hoe do you live your life

04:39.446 --> 04:41.573
with only three keys?

04:41.615 --> 04:43.700
I've got five.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.700
I've got nine.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.700
I got seven.

04:43.742 --> 04:47.704
Guys, guys, guys, do we have

04:43.742 --> 04:47.704
to do this every week?

04:47.746 --> 04:49.372
You're right.

04:49.414 --> 04:51.332
So, uh,

04:49.414 --> 04:51.332
how's the kids?

04:51.374 --> 04:52.417
You're just asking

04:51.374 --> 04:52.417
about his kids

04:52.459 --> 04:53.501
so you can talk

04:52.459 --> 04:53.501
about yours.

04:53.543 --> 04:54.836
Hey, why shouldn't I?

04:54.878 --> 04:56.546
Did I tell you

04:54.878 --> 04:56.546
that James was made

04:56.588 --> 04:58.048
captain of the wrestling team?

04:58.090 --> 05:00.842
Stevie just wrote

04:58.090 --> 05:00.842
a brand-new antivirus program.

05:00.884 --> 05:04.221
My daughter's essay scored her

05:00.884 --> 05:04.221
a trip to the White House.

05:06.056 --> 05:10.018
Malcolm has an IQ of 165.

05:10.060 --> 05:11.019
We know.

05:11.061 --> 05:12.395
You've been using

05:11.061 --> 05:12.395
that for six months.

05:12.437 --> 05:14.314
(men laughing)

05:16.191 --> 05:17.609
Would you like

05:16.191 --> 05:17.609
something

05:17.651 --> 05:19.861
from the kitchen?

05:19.903 --> 05:21.571
No...

05:21.613 --> 05:23.364
thank you.

05:23.406 --> 05:25.366
He doesn't want anything.

05:25.408 --> 05:27.286
You think they'll offer

05:25.408 --> 05:27.286
to change his diapers?

05:27.327 --> 05:28.829
I can't believe Stevie's

05:27.327 --> 05:28.829
putting up with this.

05:28.870 --> 05:30.455
Maybe we should get him

05:28.870 --> 05:30.455
a blanket.

05:28.870 --> 05:30.455
You know what?

05:30.497 --> 05:33.374
I'll take care of it.

05:30.497 --> 05:33.374
Would you like a blanket?

05:33.416 --> 05:34.417
Girls, let

05:33.416 --> 05:34.417
me explain

05:34.459 --> 05:35.836
something to you about Stevie.

05:35.877 --> 05:38.005
He's no different

05:35.877 --> 05:38.005
than the rest of us.

05:38.046 --> 05:39.881
He plays video games.

05:39.923 --> 05:41.382
He does chores

05:39.923 --> 05:41.382
around the house.

05:41.424 --> 05:42.884
He goes to the movies

05:41.424 --> 05:42.884
with friends.

05:42.926 --> 05:45.137
He leads

05:42.926 --> 05:45.137
a completely normal life.

05:46.054 --> 05:47.306
Which makes it even sadder

05:47.346 --> 05:48.890
that he only has

05:47.346 --> 05:48.890
two months to live.

05:48.932 --> 05:50.433
What?

05:50.475 --> 05:52.351
Stevie,

05:50.475 --> 05:52.351
they have a right to know.

05:53.478 --> 05:55.438
Oh, my God.

05:55.480 --> 05:57.107
Is it true?

05:59.442 --> 06:01.236
I've been told...

06:01.278 --> 06:02.863
I'm very brave.

06:02.904 --> 06:04.156
Oh.

06:12.706 --> 06:14.082
(exhales loudly)

06:14.124 --> 06:15.209
129.

06:15.250 --> 06:16.417
That didn't beat Malik.

06:16.459 --> 06:17.418
So, Malik wins

06:17.460 --> 06:18.461
the breath-holding.

06:18.503 --> 06:20.255
Abe got the most

06:18.503 --> 06:20.255
dip on a chip.

06:20.297 --> 06:22.257
Trey has the longest neck.

06:22.299 --> 06:24.009
Steve has the

06:22.299 --> 06:24.009
highest socks,

06:24.051 --> 06:25.219
and Hal, well,

06:25.260 --> 06:26.845
Hal has nothing

06:25.260 --> 06:26.845
so far.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.305
(men laughing)

06:28.347 --> 06:29.806
Yeah, the doctors are baffled.

06:29.848 --> 06:32.433
Stevie's brain is growing

06:29.848 --> 06:32.433
too big for his head.

06:32.475 --> 06:34.602
It's pressing

06:32.475 --> 06:34.602
up against his skull.

06:34.644 --> 06:37.522
They say he only has two months

06:34.644 --> 06:37.522
before it explodes.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.442
It's called...

06:41.484 --> 06:43.486
encephalo...

06:43.528 --> 06:45.446
neuryop...

06:45.488 --> 06:47.448
alitis.

06:47.490 --> 06:49.743
How horrible.

06:47.490 --> 06:49.743
Oh, God.

06:49.784 --> 06:51.452
What do you think

06:49.784 --> 06:51.452
you're doing?

06:51.494 --> 06:53.288
Helping Stevie.

06:53.330 --> 06:54.455
It's okay.

06:54.497 --> 06:56.124
It's weird, but it feels

06:54.497 --> 06:56.124
good helping people.

06:56.166 --> 06:57.959
I like being the hero.

06:58.001 --> 07:00.712
You're pimping a fatal disease

06:58.001 --> 07:00.712
to take advantage of a girl.

07:00.754 --> 07:02.339
For good.

07:03.340 --> 07:05.466
Stevie, this is so unfair.

07:05.508 --> 07:07.302
I have...

07:07.344 --> 07:09.263
no regrets.

07:09.304 --> 07:11.472
Well...

07:11.514 --> 07:12.891
one.

07:13.892 --> 07:16.561
(sobbing)

07:28.531 --> 07:30.533
"Old business." What do

07:28.531 --> 07:30.533
you think that means?

07:28.531 --> 07:30.533
I don't know.

07:30.575 --> 07:31.952
You think it's an old

07:30.575 --> 07:31.952
boyfriend or something?

07:31.993 --> 07:33.494
You know,

07:31.993 --> 07:33.494
I have no idea what it is.

07:33.536 --> 07:34.495
Sometimes

07:33.536 --> 07:34.495
those old

07:34.537 --> 07:36.706
relationships can really

07:34.537 --> 07:36.706
get a hold on you.

07:36.748 --> 07:37.874
Hey, what's up with

07:36.748 --> 07:37.874
her ex-husband?

07:37.916 --> 07:39.500
He's still in jail.

07:39.542 --> 07:41.962
Didn't his

07:39.542 --> 07:41.962
parole hearing

07:39.542 --> 07:41.962
just come up?

07:42.003 --> 07:43.380
I don't know. Maybe.

07:43.422 --> 07:44.505
Look, she'll tell me

07:43.422 --> 07:44.505
about it tonight.

07:44.547 --> 07:46.091
Whatever it is.

07:46.133 --> 07:48.509
Man, I really admire

07:46.133 --> 07:48.509
your maturity.

07:46.133 --> 07:48.509
Thank you.

07:48.551 --> 07:49.886
I'm the complete

07:48.551 --> 07:49.886
opposite.

07:49.928 --> 07:51.221
I overanalyze

07:49.928 --> 07:51.221
everything.

07:51.263 --> 07:53.140
Like how Piama didn't

07:51.263 --> 07:53.140
kiss you good-bye.

07:53.181 --> 07:54.808
I'd be totally

07:53.181 --> 07:54.808
fixated on that.

07:54.849 --> 07:58.019
Or her ex-husband

07:54.849 --> 07:58.019
being locked up without a woman

07:58.061 --> 07:59.520
for five years.

07:59.562 --> 08:00.605
That's what's

07:59.562 --> 08:00.605
wrong with me.

08:00.647 --> 08:02.357
One suspicious

08:00.647 --> 08:02.357
conversation

08:02.399 --> 08:03.900
and immediately

08:02.399 --> 08:03.900
I'm picturing

08:03.942 --> 08:05.526
sweaty bodies

08:03.942 --> 08:05.526
rolling around

08:05.568 --> 08:07.195
in front of

08:05.568 --> 08:07.195
a fireplace.

08:08.280 --> 08:10.490
God, I got a lot

08:08.280 --> 08:10.490
of growing up to do.

08:14.369 --> 08:15.578
What are you doing here?

08:15.620 --> 08:16.746
Get out.

08:16.788 --> 08:18.248
You kicked me out

08:16.788 --> 08:18.248
of my room already,

08:18.290 --> 08:19.458
so I have nowhere else to go.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.293
That's not my problem.

08:25.588 --> 08:27.007
And I don't want

08:25.588 --> 08:27.007
to hear you crying.

08:27.048 --> 08:28.300
It's a real mood-killer.

08:38.393 --> 08:39.436
Thanks, Chandra.

08:39.478 --> 08:40.770
This light's much better

08:39.478 --> 08:40.770
for his eyes.

08:40.812 --> 08:42.814
(ballad plays)

08:42.856 --> 08:44.441
The music...

08:44.483 --> 08:45.733
helps regulate...

08:45.775 --> 08:47.444
my heartbeat.

08:47.486 --> 08:50.322
I just have to go call

08:47.486 --> 08:50.322
his vitals in to the doctor.

09:02.834 --> 09:03.793
Missing something?

09:03.835 --> 09:05.586
What did you do with it?

09:05.628 --> 09:07.005
What do you think

09:05.628 --> 09:07.005
you're doing with a gun?

09:07.047 --> 09:08.673
Are you insane?

09:07.047 --> 09:08.673
Give it back.

09:08.715 --> 09:10.591
No. You don't bring

09:08.715 --> 09:10.591
a gun into this house.

09:10.633 --> 09:11.801
You don't get to have a gun.

09:11.843 --> 09:12.844
Where is it?

09:12.886 --> 09:14.595
This is where

09:12.886 --> 09:14.595
my family lives.

09:14.637 --> 09:16.597
You don't even know them

09:14.637 --> 09:16.597
and you bring a gun here?

09:16.639 --> 09:17.765
What the hell is wrong with you?

09:17.807 --> 09:19.393
You'd better tell me

09:17.807 --> 09:19.393
where it is.

09:19.434 --> 09:21.019
No way, you can't

09:19.434 --> 09:21.019
have a gun.

09:21.061 --> 09:22.187
It's not mine.

09:21.061 --> 09:22.187
It's my boyfriend's.

09:22.229 --> 09:23.230
I'm just holding it for him

09:23.271 --> 09:24.647
because his parents

09:23.271 --> 09:24.647
search his room.

09:24.689 --> 09:25.606
Well, they should.

09:25.648 --> 09:26.649
He's got a gun.

09:27.901 --> 09:28.985
Tell me where it is.

09:29.027 --> 09:29.528
No.

09:31.654 --> 09:32.613
That's not even mine.

09:41.540 --> 09:44.209
Don't you have anything in

09:41.540 --> 09:44.209
this house that isn't junk?!

09:44.251 --> 09:45.585
No.

09:50.173 --> 09:51.674
(all groaning)

09:51.716 --> 09:53.634
Damn!

09:51.716 --> 09:53.634
Big deal.

09:53.676 --> 09:55.970
Who can stuff the most pretzels

09:53.676 --> 09:55.970
in their mouth at one time?

10:01.684 --> 10:04.479
(hacking)

10:04.521 --> 10:05.855
(shouting incoherently)

10:05.897 --> 10:07.941
(coughing)

10:17.784 --> 10:19.911
Okay, who can throw a

10:17.784 --> 10:19.911
potato chip the farthest?

10:21.788 --> 10:24.832
I've never met anyone

10:21.788 --> 10:24.832
who was going to die before.

10:24.874 --> 10:27.252
We're all dying.

10:27.294 --> 10:29.712
I'm just...

10:29.754 --> 10:31.672
going...

10:31.714 --> 10:33.674
before Thanksgiving.

10:33.716 --> 10:35.176
That's terrible.

10:35.218 --> 10:37.678
It makes me...

10:37.720 --> 10:39.973
appreciate...

10:40.014 --> 10:41.682
the time...

10:41.724 --> 10:43.684
I have.

10:43.726 --> 10:46.354
Wow, that's beautiful.

10:46.396 --> 10:48.689
You're so...

10:48.731 --> 10:50.691
alive.

10:50.733 --> 10:52.693
Can I...

10:52.735 --> 10:54.695
tongue-kiss you?

10:54.737 --> 10:56.281
What?

10:54.737 --> 10:56.281
I-I'm sorry.

10:56.323 --> 10:58.325
The pressure...

10:58.366 --> 10:59.534
on my brain...

10:59.576 --> 11:00.535
(groans)

11:00.577 --> 11:03.622
Oh, you poor baby.

11:06.749 --> 11:08.376
What are you doing here?!

11:08.418 --> 11:09.628
What do you think?

11:09.669 --> 11:10.670
Go pee outside.

11:12.005 --> 11:14.715
Oh, for God's sake!

11:14.757 --> 11:16.050
Out.

11:22.140 --> 11:24.434
MAN:

11:22.140 --> 11:24.434
At the tone, the time will be

11:24.476 --> 11:27.145
8:22 and 30 seconds.

11:27.187 --> 11:28.438
TREY:

11:27.187 --> 11:28.438
Bam!

11:28.480 --> 11:29.814
Right to the millisecond.

11:29.856 --> 11:31.732
I'm two seconds off.

11:29.856 --> 11:31.732
I'm three.

11:31.774 --> 11:32.775
Same here.

11:32.817 --> 11:34.735
Hal, you don't even have

11:32.817 --> 11:34.735
a minute hand.

11:34.777 --> 11:38.781
Well, it's, it's really

11:34.777 --> 11:38.781
more of a decorative piece.

11:38.823 --> 11:39.991
(men laughing)

11:48.833 --> 11:50.043
Where is it?

11:50.084 --> 11:51.294
Where's what?

11:58.677 --> 12:00.011
Full house

12:00.053 --> 12:01.762
nines over aces.

12:01.804 --> 12:02.805
(laughing)

12:02.847 --> 12:04.641
Yeah, looks like

12:02.847 --> 12:04.641
I'm on a roll.

12:04.683 --> 12:06.226
And I expect to stay on one

12:06.267 --> 12:09.396
once I get home to Alana,

12:06.267 --> 12:09.396
if you know what I mean.

12:09.437 --> 12:11.772
So, what is this, the third

12:09.437 --> 12:11.772
Wednesday of the month?

12:11.814 --> 12:14.942
ALL: Ooh!

12:11.814 --> 12:14.942
Hey, I do fine,

12:11.814 --> 12:14.942
thank you very much.

12:14.984 --> 12:15.985
Oh, yeah?

12:16.027 --> 12:17.195
What's the number?

12:17.237 --> 12:19.614
Whoa-whoa-whoa,

12:17.237 --> 12:19.614
we're not going to do this.

12:19.656 --> 12:21.324
Just deal the cards, will you?

12:22.450 --> 12:23.702
Three.

12:23.742 --> 12:25.495
Four.

12:25.537 --> 12:26.663
Five.

12:26.705 --> 12:27.788
Two.

12:27.830 --> 12:29.790
Two?

12:27.830 --> 12:29.790
Ouch.

12:29.832 --> 12:31.376
Just twice a week?

12:31.418 --> 12:33.044
Oh, per week-- oh, then...

12:34.753 --> 12:35.796
Fourteen.

12:35.838 --> 12:36.881
14? Come on.

12:36.923 --> 12:37.882
No way.

12:37.924 --> 12:39.092
No, he's telling the truth.

12:39.133 --> 12:40.968
Believe me.

12:39.133 --> 12:40.968
I went on vacation with him.

12:41.010 --> 12:43.762
If anything,

12:41.010 --> 12:43.762
he's underselling himself.

12:44.931 --> 12:46.266
Well, I... guess I win.

12:46.307 --> 12:47.475
(chuckling softly)

12:47.517 --> 12:49.852
I mean, it's really

12:47.517 --> 12:49.852
none of your business.

12:49.894 --> 12:51.312
I don't care

12:51.354 --> 12:52.689
how high you wear your socks.

12:52.731 --> 12:53.690
You ain't beating that.

12:53.732 --> 12:54.815
(all laughing)

12:54.857 --> 12:56.443
Hey, hats off

12:54.857 --> 12:56.443
to you, man.

12:57.860 --> 12:59.738
Yeah, now we know why

12:57.860 --> 12:59.738
you're so bad at poker.

12:59.778 --> 13:01.822
I don't even know

12:59.778 --> 13:01.822
how you can keep your eyes open.

13:01.864 --> 13:02.990
(all laughing)

13:03.032 --> 13:04.825
Oh, you'd better watch it, Hal.

13:04.867 --> 13:06.827
She must be angling

13:04.867 --> 13:06.827
for something big.

13:06.869 --> 13:07.828
What are you talking about?

13:07.870 --> 13:09.080
Well, you know

13:07.870 --> 13:09.080
she's gonna want

13:09.122 --> 13:10.123
something in exchange.

13:10.164 --> 13:11.832
You don't get anything

13:10.164 --> 13:11.832
free with women.

13:11.874 --> 13:12.875
Listen to you.

13:12.917 --> 13:14.419
With that attitude

13:14.461 --> 13:16.713
it's no wonder

13:14.461 --> 13:16.713
you're not doing any better.

13:16.755 --> 13:17.922
ALL:

13:16.755 --> 13:17.922
Ooh...

13:17.964 --> 13:19.840
Well, don't put that on me, pal.

13:19.882 --> 13:21.217
Uh, can we...?

13:19.882 --> 13:21.217
HAL:

13:19.882 --> 13:21.217
Let me ask you something.

13:21.259 --> 13:24.345
When was the last time

13:21.259 --> 13:24.345
you sent your wife flowers?

13:24.387 --> 13:25.846
Well, how come

13:24.387 --> 13:25.846
it's always the man

13:25.888 --> 13:27.307
that has to send the flowers?

13:27.348 --> 13:28.849
I would love

13:27.348 --> 13:28.849
to get some flowers.

13:28.891 --> 13:29.850
Might as well stretch.

13:29.892 --> 13:31.144
This is going

13:29.892 --> 13:31.144
to take a while.

13:31.185 --> 13:32.270
Did you ever

13:31.185 --> 13:32.270
stop to think

13:32.312 --> 13:33.854
that women are independent

13:33.896 --> 13:34.939
human beings

13:34.981 --> 13:35.856
who can make their own...

13:35.898 --> 13:37.275
...choices?

13:37.317 --> 13:38.943
If you look at any

13:37.317 --> 13:38.943
successful relationship

13:38.985 --> 13:41.362
you'll find one common element

13:38.985 --> 13:41.362
at their core: trust.

13:41.404 --> 13:42.863
That's fine, Francis,

13:42.905 --> 13:45.366
but I really didn't need

13:42.905 --> 13:45.366
the hour-and-20-minute speech.

13:45.408 --> 13:47.868
I was just going to ask

13:45.408 --> 13:47.868
if you wanted to take off early

13:47.910 --> 13:49.870
'cause I was willing

13:47.910 --> 13:49.870
to cover your shift,

13:49.912 --> 13:51.956
but evidently

13:49.912 --> 13:51.956
you're not concerned, so I...

13:53.374 --> 13:54.833
(door slams)

13:57.796 --> 13:59.380
You like...

13:59.422 --> 14:00.881
this?

14:00.923 --> 14:02.383
Oh, yeah.

14:02.425 --> 14:03.593
You know something,

14:02.425 --> 14:03.593
Stevie?

14:03.635 --> 14:04.885
Maybe it was

14:03.635 --> 14:04.885
meant for me

14:04.927 --> 14:05.886
to be here with

14:04.927 --> 14:05.886
you, you know?

14:05.928 --> 14:07.681
I mean, wasn't it fate

14:07.722 --> 14:10.684
that made  Dawson's Creek

14:07.722 --> 14:10.684
a rerun so I came here?

14:10.725 --> 14:17.273
I guess... fate...

14:10.725 --> 14:17.273
can be kind... too.

14:17.315 --> 14:21.902
Oh, this is so awful.

14:21.944 --> 14:22.945
Stop.

14:22.987 --> 14:24.155
It's okay.

14:24.197 --> 14:25.573
No, it's not okay.

14:25.615 --> 14:28.409
I just keep thinking

14:25.615 --> 14:28.409
about everything

14:28.451 --> 14:30.537
you're going

14:28.451 --> 14:30.537
to miss out on.

14:30.578 --> 14:32.831
You're never

14:30.578 --> 14:32.831
going to grow up.

14:32.872 --> 14:35.709
You're never going

14:32.872 --> 14:35.709
to go to your prom.

14:35.750 --> 14:37.126
I mean,

14:35.750 --> 14:37.126
you're never

14:37.168 --> 14:40.380
going to know what

14:37.168 --> 14:40.380
it's like to be loved.

14:40.421 --> 14:42.423
(sobbing)

14:42.465 --> 14:44.592
What I'm thinking

14:42.465 --> 14:44.592
about doing--

14:44.634 --> 14:47.554
it goes against everything

14:44.634 --> 14:47.554
I believe in, okay?

14:47.595 --> 14:51.182
But then, I don't even know

14:47.595 --> 14:51.182
what I believe in anymore.

14:51.224 --> 14:52.851
(sobbing):

14:51.224 --> 14:52.851
It's like,

14:52.892 --> 14:57.397
what kind of a God could just

14:52.892 --> 14:57.397
let you die like this?!

14:57.438 --> 14:58.857
(sobbing)

15:03.570 --> 15:07.574
I'll ask... when I see him.

15:07.615 --> 15:09.116
When was the last time

15:09.158 --> 15:10.785
you just made time

15:09.158 --> 15:10.785
to talk to her?!

15:10.827 --> 15:11.828
You're perfectly happy

15:11.870 --> 15:13.037
just closing off

15:13.079 --> 15:14.455
and not sharing

15:13.079 --> 15:14.455
your feelings.

15:14.497 --> 15:15.956
Why don't you just

15:14.497 --> 15:15.956
get off my back?!

15:15.998 --> 15:16.957
There it is!

15:16.999 --> 15:18.959
You're shutting

15:16.999 --> 15:18.959
me out!

15:19.001 --> 15:20.837
Why can't

15:19.001 --> 15:20.837
you just talk to me?!

15:20.879 --> 15:22.338
So that you can twist

15:20.879 --> 15:22.338
my words around

15:22.380 --> 15:23.964
and just throw

15:22.380 --> 15:23.964
them back at me?

15:24.006 --> 15:27.385
How many times do I have

15:24.006 --> 15:27.385
to apologize for that?!

15:27.427 --> 15:28.428
You've been drinking,

15:27.427 --> 15:28.428
haven't you?

15:28.469 --> 15:29.970
Well, I warned you,

15:30.012 --> 15:31.055
but you didn't give me

15:30.012 --> 15:31.055
any other choice.

15:31.097 --> 15:32.973
Now my boyfriend's coming over

15:33.015 --> 15:35.142
and he's going to get that gun

15:33.015 --> 15:35.142
from you one way or another.

15:35.184 --> 15:36.644
Oh, little

15:35.184 --> 15:36.644
Markie Rosenbaum's

15:36.686 --> 15:38.062
going to come over

15:36.686 --> 15:38.062
and scare me.

15:38.104 --> 15:40.022
I broke up with Markie.

15:40.064 --> 15:42.024
I'm dating Derek Fowler.

15:42.066 --> 15:43.192
Derek Fowler?!

15:43.234 --> 15:44.360
He's a psycho!

15:44.402 --> 15:45.904
What happened

15:44.402 --> 15:45.904
to Markie?!

15:45.945 --> 15:46.987
I loved Markie!

15:47.029 --> 15:48.448
You guys were

15:47.029 --> 15:48.448
great together!

15:48.489 --> 15:49.990
You know, Derek's going

15:48.489 --> 15:49.990
to make you tell him

15:50.032 --> 15:50.991
where that gun is.

15:51.033 --> 15:52.243
Where are you going?

15:52.285 --> 15:54.788
I don't want

15:52.285 --> 15:54.788
to be anywhere near here

15:54.829 --> 15:55.872
when he shows up.

15:55.914 --> 15:57.457
Chandra, I'm going home!

15:57.498 --> 16:00.960
STEVIE:

15:57.498 --> 16:00.960
Sayo... nara.

16:02.044 --> 16:03.838
Well, maybe

16:02.044 --> 16:03.838
I'll just call the cops.

16:03.880 --> 16:05.005
Go ahead.

16:05.047 --> 16:06.674
Let's hope they get here first.

16:14.223 --> 16:15.308
That's it!

16:15.349 --> 16:16.517
I've had it!

16:16.559 --> 16:17.894
Dewey, shut up!

16:17.936 --> 16:20.897
You guys broke all my stuff!

16:20.939 --> 16:22.482
Look, I've got something

16:20.939 --> 16:22.482
good going on in there

16:22.523 --> 16:23.942
and I don't want

16:22.523 --> 16:23.942
you to ruin it.

16:23.983 --> 16:25.985
This is all I have left!

16:27.361 --> 16:30.239
There. Now you got

16:27.361 --> 16:30.239
nothing to worry about.

16:30.281 --> 16:31.616
End of discussion.

16:31.658 --> 16:33.701
(slams door)

16:35.787 --> 16:37.037
Oh, my God.

16:37.079 --> 16:39.039
How can a night

16:37.079 --> 16:39.039
that started out so badly

16:39.081 --> 16:39.999
get even worse?

16:40.708 --> 16:41.876
Wait.

16:41.918 --> 16:42.961
Don't panic.

16:43.002 --> 16:44.211
Think for a second.

16:44.253 --> 16:45.546
No, this is good.

16:45.588 --> 16:46.923
This is sensible.

16:48.174 --> 16:50.092
I make those kind of statements

16:50.134 --> 16:52.887
and just assume

16:50.134 --> 16:52.887
that she knows I'm sorry.

16:52.929 --> 16:54.848
(others murmuring assent)

16:54.889 --> 16:56.223
And you know what?

16:56.265 --> 16:57.725
That's not right.

16:57.767 --> 16:59.894
She deserves better than that.

16:59.936 --> 17:01.061
That's all I needed to hear.

17:01.103 --> 17:02.313
I'm going to call

17:01.103 --> 17:02.313
that woman up

17:02.355 --> 17:04.524
and tell her

17:02.355 --> 17:04.524
just how much I love her.

17:04.565 --> 17:06.609
(all chuckling and encouraging)

17:11.364 --> 17:13.282
Hello?

17:13.324 --> 17:15.284
Earl, is that you?

17:15.326 --> 17:17.745
Earl, what the hell

17:15.326 --> 17:17.745
you doing at my house?

17:17.787 --> 17:19.622
Hello?

17:23.626 --> 17:27.087
I-I'm, I'm going

17:23.626 --> 17:27.087
to go home now

17:27.129 --> 17:29.799
'cause I-I got

17:27.129 --> 17:29.799
a thing to do tomorrow.

17:29.841 --> 17:32.051
(all mumbling)

17:39.809 --> 17:41.519
Well, I guess the game's over.

17:41.561 --> 17:43.938
ALL:

17:41.561 --> 17:43.938
Yeah.

17:45.732 --> 17:48.108
You know, I've

17:45.732 --> 17:48.108
wondered why Earl

17:48.150 --> 17:50.110
never came

17:48.150 --> 17:50.110
to the game.

17:50.152 --> 17:51.195
Dad, I've tried

17:51.237 --> 17:52.780
to be understanding

17:51.237 --> 17:52.780
about all this,

17:52.822 --> 17:54.407
but there is a limit.

17:54.448 --> 17:57.702
You have a right to know

17:54.448 --> 17:57.702
what's going on in this house.

17:57.744 --> 18:00.120
Dewey,

17:57.744 --> 18:00.120
now is not the time to be...

18:00.162 --> 18:01.581
Normally,

18:00.162 --> 18:01.581
I don't mind

18:01.622 --> 18:04.792
being a snitch,

18:01.622 --> 18:04.792
but this even makes me sad.

18:04.834 --> 18:07.086
This is what

18:04.834 --> 18:07.086
your son is up to.

18:09.171 --> 18:10.423
Stevie! What are you doing?!

18:10.464 --> 18:12.132
DEWEY:

18:10.464 --> 18:12.132
Where's Reese?!

18:12.174 --> 18:14.510
REESE:

18:12.174 --> 18:14.510
I was about to take

18:12.174 --> 18:14.510
a scented bath.

18:14.552 --> 18:15.803
Is something

18:14.552 --> 18:15.803
going on?

18:15.845 --> 18:18.138
Lamb chop! Put

18:15.845 --> 18:18.138
your sweater on!

18:18.180 --> 18:20.892
Dad... I...

18:23.185 --> 18:25.104
Stevie, how cou...?

18:28.190 --> 18:29.943
It's not...

18:29.984 --> 18:31.235
what it looks like.

18:31.277 --> 18:33.153
Well, it looks...

18:33.195 --> 18:36.115
like she was on your lap!

18:37.450 --> 18:39.159
(gunshot and screaming)

18:39.201 --> 18:41.788
Oh, my God, his head exploded!

18:42.455 --> 18:43.414
Abe, are you okay?

18:43.456 --> 18:44.624
(wheezing)

18:48.294 --> 18:50.212
I think so.

18:50.254 --> 18:51.798
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry!

18:51.839 --> 18:52.924
Is everyone okay?!

18:55.509 --> 18:58.471
I mean... what was that?

18:58.512 --> 19:00.180
Face it, Dad.

19:00.222 --> 19:02.058
You were

19:00.222 --> 19:02.058
a crappy father.

19:02.100 --> 19:03.684
All you ever cared about

19:03.726 --> 19:06.104
was women, drinking,

19:03.726 --> 19:06.104
and stealing.

19:06.145 --> 19:07.187
You know what?

19:07.229 --> 19:09.231
I can't talk

19:07.229 --> 19:09.231
about this anymore.

19:09.273 --> 19:11.859
How many times

19:09.273 --> 19:11.859
do I have to say it?

19:11.901 --> 19:13.193
I need money!

19:13.235 --> 19:14.528
FRANCIS:

19:13.235 --> 19:14.528
Guess who's home.

19:15.321 --> 19:16.864
What are you doing here?!

19:16.906 --> 19:18.198
I got off early.

19:18.240 --> 19:20.994
Hello. I'm Francis,

19:18.240 --> 19:20.994
Piama's  husband.

19:21.035 --> 19:21.702
You're married?

19:21.744 --> 19:23.121
Hmm...

19:23.162 --> 19:24.914
Didn't think that

19:23.162 --> 19:24.914
was worth mentioning?

19:24.956 --> 19:26.206
Very cozy.

19:26.248 --> 19:28.334
Francis, I told you I...

19:29.543 --> 19:32.505
Hey, I had a life

19:29.543 --> 19:32.505
before I met you.

19:33.547 --> 19:35.925
Maybe I haven't

19:33.547 --> 19:35.925
been fair to you.

19:35.967 --> 19:38.719
I mean, our relationship

19:35.967 --> 19:38.719
wasn't all bad.

19:38.761 --> 19:41.055
Remember

19:38.761 --> 19:41.055
all the tickle fights?

19:41.097 --> 19:42.515
Oh, yeah, those were wild.

19:42.556 --> 19:43.432
(both laughing)

19:43.474 --> 19:45.225
I remember this one time

19:45.267 --> 19:47.478
we were taking a bath together,

19:45.267 --> 19:47.478
and she started squirming...

19:47.520 --> 19:50.272
Ah! No, I don't want

19:47.520 --> 19:50.272
to hear this!

19:50.314 --> 19:51.482
Aw, come on.

19:51.524 --> 19:53.693
It's a funny story,

19:51.524 --> 19:53.693
Francis.

19:53.734 --> 19:56.737
And he loves telling it,

19:53.734 --> 19:56.737
don't you, Dad?

19:56.779 --> 19:58.238
"Dad"?

19:58.280 --> 19:59.907
Yup.

19:59.949 --> 20:02.242
I just...

19:59.949 --> 20:02.242
Oh, I'm, I'm so sorry.

20:02.284 --> 20:04.912
I just... I mean,

20:02.284 --> 20:04.912
it's a real pleasure

20:04.954 --> 20:06.164
to meet you, sir.

20:06.205 --> 20:07.707
Do you have

20:06.205 --> 20:07.707
any money?

20:07.748 --> 20:09.500
No.

20:09.542 --> 20:12.378
Well, tonight's been

20:09.542 --> 20:12.378
a big ball of nothing.

20:16.757 --> 20:19.760
I'm going to go

20:16.757 --> 20:19.760
finish off my shift.

20:23.764 --> 20:25.766
Love you, honey!

20:27.101 --> 20:28.895
You are never seeing

20:27.101 --> 20:28.895
that girl again.

20:28.936 --> 20:30.146
And you sure as hell

20:30.188 --> 20:31.647
are never seeing

20:30.188 --> 20:31.647
that boy again.

20:31.689 --> 20:32.857
You know what?

20:32.899 --> 20:35.526
You are not seeing

20:32.899 --> 20:35.526
daylight for the

20:32.899 --> 20:35.526
next six months.

20:35.568 --> 20:37.195
OFFICER:

20:35.568 --> 20:37.195
Just tell me

20:35.568 --> 20:37.195
what happened.

20:37.236 --> 20:42.282
We... were playing...

20:42.324 --> 20:43.534
cards.

20:43.576 --> 20:45.119
Okay.

20:45.161 --> 20:47.287
Let's start with you.

20:47.329 --> 20:51.375
Well...

20:51.417 --> 20:53.920
it's like...

20:55.129 --> 20:56.463
...this.

20:56.505 --> 20:57.381
So, let me see.

20:57.423 --> 20:58.382
You found a gun.

20:58.424 --> 20:59.967
Didn't tell your father.

21:00.009 --> 21:02.178
Handled it,

21:00.009 --> 21:02.178
hid it inside the house.

21:02.220 --> 21:03.721
Handled it again to move it

21:03.763 --> 21:06.015
and tried to destroy it

21:03.763 --> 21:06.015
with a hacksaw.

21:06.057 --> 21:08.475
And at no point

21:06.057 --> 21:08.475
did you contact the police

21:08.517 --> 21:10.310
until after the gun went off.

21:10.352 --> 21:11.771
Yes.

21:11.812 --> 21:14.314
What did you say your IQ was?

21:15.775 --> 21:16.984
Man, what a night.

21:17.026 --> 21:18.360
When that thing

21:17.026 --> 21:18.360
went off,

21:18.402 --> 21:20.696
I couldn't believe

21:18.402 --> 21:20.696
how scared I was.

21:20.738 --> 21:22.322
You were scared?

21:22.364 --> 21:24.324
Hey, I was way more scared

21:22.364 --> 21:24.324
than you guys.

21:24.366 --> 21:25.325
Are you kidding me?

21:25.367 --> 21:26.619
I screamed

21:25.367 --> 21:26.619
like a little girl.

21:26.660 --> 21:29.163
Puh-leeze! I could

21:26.660 --> 21:29.163
have broke glass

21:26.660 --> 21:29.163
the way I screamed.

21:29.205 --> 21:31.165
You sounded like a hero

21:29.205 --> 21:31.165
compared to how I...

21:31.207 --> 21:33.793
(men arguing)
