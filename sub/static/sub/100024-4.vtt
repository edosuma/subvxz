David, hey.

12:22.002 --> 12:23.438
You didn't check in
with me this morning,

12:23.481 --> 12:25.092
everything okay
with you at Seren's?

12:25.135 --> 12:27.268
Uh yeah, Ray came home early,

12:27.311 --> 12:29.749
so you'll have to talk to him.

12:29.792 --> 12:31.228
Mhm, what about your project?

12:31.272 --> 12:32.490
That go okay?

12:32.534 --> 12:35.755
Yeah mamma, why you callin'?

12:35.798 --> 12:37.191
Look,

12:38.845 --> 12:41.282
I'ma need to get
home in time for J.

12:41.325 --> 12:43.240
But I have my first session
with the counselor today.

12:43.284 --> 12:45.155
I'ma be late, remember?

12:46.026 --> 12:47.592
Of course I remember,

12:47.636 --> 12:50.421
that's something you
definitely gotta do.

12:50.465 --> 12:51.596
But if you need me--

12:51.640 --> 12:53.947
Nope, I'll figure it out.

12:53.990 --> 12:55.426
If the principal thinks
you need to see her,

12:55.470 --> 12:57.167
then you see her.

12:58.952 --> 13:00.605
[sighs] Are you sure?

13:00.649 --> 13:02.129
Yeah, I'm sure.

13:02.172 --> 13:05.349
That's much more
important, you hear me?

13:05.393 --> 13:06.829
Is everything okay?

13:06.873 --> 13:08.700
Everything's fine.

13:08.744 --> 13:10.224
Love you, okay?

13:12.356 --> 13:13.749
Love you, Ma.

13:35.249 --> 13:37.642
Does that taste alright?

13:37.686 --> 13:39.775
Yeah, why?

13:40.515 --> 13:42.560
Maybe the bus boy took my plate.

13:42.604 --> 13:44.301
I ordered this.

13:44.345 --> 13:45.999
Okay, good.

13:46.042 --> 13:47.870
'Cause I left a
plate of food there

13:47.914 --> 13:50.960
that fell on the floor
near the rat trap,

13:51.004 --> 13:53.136
but if you say that's yours--

13:53.180 --> 13:54.659
no, you don't want it?

13:54.703 --> 13:57.358
Don't taste so good now, huh?

14:16.420 --> 14:19.597
[whistles] Ma'am?

14:24.646 --> 14:26.039

14:34.743 --> 14:36.876
Oh my god, I'm so sorry.

14:36.919 --> 14:38.616
Thank you.

14:38.660 --> 14:42.055
It's been one of
them days, you know?

14:42.098 --> 14:45.058
Desserts on me, for
the entire family.

14:47.103 --> 14:49.889
[Woman] Aw, she didn't
have to do that.

14:56.634 --> 14:59.246
Can't comp an entire
family's dessert.

15:00.508 --> 15:02.423
It's just dessert.

15:02.466 --> 15:04.294
Well then it's coming
out of your check.

15:05.426 --> 15:07.254
Fine Jay.

15:07.776 --> 15:09.082
I'm sorry.

15:10.474 --> 15:11.823
Didn't I say--

15:11.867 --> 15:13.260
You know what, that's it.
You're fired.

15:14.261 --> 15:15.740
What?

15:15.784 --> 15:16.959
Jay, please don't
play with my money.

15:17.003 --> 15:18.787
You're not even making sense,

15:18.830 --> 15:20.745
-I'll pay out of my check.
-I'm not playing, Gloria.

15:20.789 --> 15:21.964
Yeah, I can't do this anymore.

15:22.008 --> 15:23.574
You defy me every
second your here.

15:23.618 --> 15:25.228
Ain't nobody defying nobody!

15:25.272 --> 15:26.360
Look!

15:27.187 --> 15:28.623
You just play out your shift

15:28.666 --> 15:29.624
and then I want you out of here.

15:29.667 --> 15:31.278
Jay!

Dinner for you and
the boys tonight,

16:10.056 --> 16:11.971

16:12.014 --> 16:15.278
I can bring more
over the weekend.

16:15.322 --> 16:17.106
I can cook.

16:17.150 --> 16:18.890
I know just,

16:18.934 --> 16:22.633
you call me when you run
out of something to cook.

16:22.677 --> 16:23.765
Okay?

16:27.203 --> 16:28.988
'Preciate you.

16:29.031 --> 16:30.859
Thanks for the food.

16:33.340 --> 16:34.515
Bye, baby.

16:52.533 --> 16:54.056
Forget the manager position,

16:54.100 --> 16:57.581
I'll just keep doing
what I'm doing,

16:57.625 --> 17:01.803
find some hours, and make
extra money that way.

17:05.459 --> 17:06.590
Jay?

17:06.634 --> 17:07.896
Please, okay?

17:09.811 --> 17:12.857
Jay!
Please!

17:12.901 --> 17:16.731
[truck drowning out Gloria]

17:34.096 --> 17:36.533
I'm gonna need you to
watch J 'til I get home.

17:36.577 --> 17:39.710
I'm sorry, but I'm not
gonna be back in time.

17:39.754 --> 17:42.104
I'm out here trying to
get Star squared away.

17:47.588 --> 17:49.546
I forgot David has
his first session

17:49.590 --> 17:51.113
with the counselor today.

17:51.157 --> 17:54.073
Glo, you got a least
a couple hours, okay?

17:54.116 --> 17:56.075
You gon' make it.

17:56.118 --> 17:58.773
Thanks, Elijah, talk to you.

18:00.949 --> 18:03.299
Almost done, just a
few more questions.

18:03.343 --> 18:04.735
Anything you could do
to speed up the process

18:04.779 --> 18:08.087
would be greatly appreciated.

18:08.130 --> 18:11.612
Steve here is anxious to
get back to his education.

18:11.655 --> 18:14.223
He's got a bright future,
scholarship waiting for him,

18:14.267 --> 18:16.312
so no need for financial aid.

18:16.356 --> 18:18.097
Is this your first time
applying to job corp?

18:18.140 --> 18:19.098
Yeah.

18:25.147 --> 18:27.584
Miami-Dade is a county.

18:27.628 --> 18:29.456
I was asking your nephew.

18:29.499 --> 18:31.762
What seems to be the problem?

18:31.806 --> 18:34.591
You have a flawless application,

18:34.635 --> 18:35.984
a signed guardian of consent.

18:36.027 --> 18:39.596
This ID,
now look it's good, okay?

18:39.640 --> 18:42.947
It's real good, it even scans,

18:42.991 --> 18:46.255
but I have a feeling I'm gonna
find another name for you.

18:46.299 --> 18:49.389
And it's not gonna
be Steven Child.

18:56.004 --> 18:58.354
All he wants is a chance.

19:00.313 --> 19:03.620
Isn't that the very nature
of your job description?

19:03.664 --> 19:08.016
To get those qualified
applicants who come to you, a
chance.

19:08.059 --> 19:11.628
I'm sorry, but our resources
are for Miami residents

19:11.672 --> 19:13.021

walking crime scene,

21:02.609 --> 21:05.568
but today bruised
ribs from a fall.

Bruised ribs, that's gotta hurt.
