-You're not going, either.

Who?

20:36.565 --> 20:39.363
How I met John Frobisher.

20:39.685 --> 20:43.234
It was 30 years ago.
You weren't even born.

20:45.085 --> 20:48.282
I was on attachment
to the civil service,

20:48.365 --> 20:49.923
only for six months.

20:51.405 --> 20:54.397
<i>And just down the corridor,</i>
<i>there he was.</i>

20:58.045 --> 20:59.797
You wouldn't think it
to look at him now,

20:59.885 --> 21:01.477
but he was a clumsy thing.

21:02.445 --> 21:04.720
Always losing his keys.

21:05.245 --> 21:08.237
Mr Swales never thought
he'd amount to much,

21:09.085 --> 21:10.234
but I thought,

21:11.645 --> 21:15.194
''Well, keep an eye on that one.''

21:18.485 --> 21:20.521
And all the others came and went.

21:20.605 --> 21:22.482
<i>The high flyers,</i>

21:22.565 --> 21:27.320
<i>they burnt out</i>
<i>or went on to something better.</i>

21:27.405 --> 21:29.521
<i>And do you know what John Frobisher did?</i>

21:31.965 --> 21:33.876
He kept working.

21:35.005 --> 21:38.315
Head down, worked hard, all his life.

21:42.765 --> 21:46.678
It was another 1 0 years
before we actually worked

21:46.765 --> 21:48.483
in the same office.

21:49.845 --> 21:51.244
He asked for me.

21:53.285 --> 21:55.480
<i>I didn't think he even knew my name.</i>

21:56.805 --> 22:00.115
And we made quite the team.

22:02.765 --> 22:04.642
I'm not saying he was perfect.

22:06.205 --> 22:08.514
You know that better than me.

22:09.565 --> 22:12.796
But he worked hard.
He always worked hard.

22:12.885 --> 22:15.843
I don't think that's
valued enough these days, hard work.

22:20.845 --> 22:24.042
<i>And he was a good man.</i>

22:25.765 --> 22:27.721
I want you to know that.

22:29.365 --> 22:32.163
John Frobisher was a good man.

22:35.725 --> 22:38.956
Because when the history
of this is written,

22:39.045 --> 22:41.479
they'll talk about the ministers,

22:41.565 --> 22:44.762
and the soldiers,
and the things with numbers for names.

22:44.845 --> 22:47.917
And I think people will forget

22:48.005 --> 22:51.714
how very good he was.

23:05.885 --> 23:08.035
<i>I want you to remember him like that.</i>

23:09.405 --> 23:12.044
If ever you think of John Frobisher,

just remember that it wasn't his fault.

51:49.325 --> 51:50.917
Thank you, Bridget. You're free to go.

51:51.005 --> 51:54.475
And Miss Habiba will be released.
I'll see to it myself.

51:56.765 --> 51:58.995
I think I'll be taking charge
of very many things

51:59.125 --> 52:00.763
in the days to come.

52:02.205 --> 52:03.923
Is that all, sir?

52:45.965 --> 52:48.718
STEVEN: <i>Uncle Jack!</i>
JACK: <i>Hey, soldier.</i>

52:49.165 --> 52:51.076
<i>(STEVEN LAUGHING)</i>

53:41.365 --> 53:43.162
There's no more road.

53:43.285 --> 53:45.003
We'll have to walk from now on.
You all right?

53:45.085 --> 53:46.996
You fuss over me one more time...

53:47.085 --> 53:49.394
-I'm just saying.
-Well, don't.

54:02.445 --> 54:03.924
(GWEN CHUCKLING)

54:04.685 --> 54:07.961
Couldn't have
just chosen a pub, could you?

54:08.045 --> 54:10.001
RHYS: It's bloody freezing.

54:11.605 --> 54:12.640
My feet.

54:12.725 --> 54:15.444
Oh, I miss that, the Welsh complaining.

54:16.685 --> 54:18.960
-You look good.
-I look huge.

54:19.885 --> 54:21.159
She's bloody gorgeous.

54:21.245 --> 54:22.724
(GWEN CHUCKLING)

54:32.365 --> 54:33.798
You okay?

54:34.725 --> 54:36.078
Yeah.

54:39.725 --> 54:41.124
Did it work?

54:42.925 --> 54:44.916
Travelled all sorts of places.

54:47.045 --> 54:48.842
This planet is too small.

54:50.045 --> 54:52.559
The whole world is like a graveyard.

54:54.525 --> 54:56.277
Come back with us.

54:57.085 --> 54:58.723
Haven't travelled far enough yet.

55:00.965 --> 55:03.399
Got a lot of dirt to shake off my shoes.

55:05.285 --> 55:08.038
And right now,
there's a cold-fusion cruiser

55:08.125 --> 55:11.515
surfing the ion reefs
just at the edge of the solar system,

55:12.965 --> 55:15.684
just waiting to open its transport dock.

55:16.965 --> 55:18.717
I just need to send a signal.

55:24.365 --> 55:27.163
They found it in the wreckage.
Indestructible.

55:27.245 --> 55:28.473
(GWEN SIGHS)

55:28.565 --> 55:32.035
Like its owner.
I put on a new strap for you.

55:32.125 --> 55:34.593
-Cost me 50 quid, that.
-Bill me.

55:34.685 --> 55:36.323
Are you ever coming back, Jack?

55:38.485 --> 55:40.043
-What for?
-For me.

55:45.605 --> 55:47.436
It wasn't your fault.

55:47.525 --> 55:49.117
-I think it was.
-No.

55:49.205 --> 55:52.083
Steven and Ianto

55:52.165 --> 55:54.599
and Owen and Tosh and Suzie and...

55:56.765 --> 55:58.835
All of them, because of me.

55:59.405 --> 56:01.316
But you saved us.

56:02.085 --> 56:03.484
Didn't you?

56:04.325 --> 56:06.236
I began to like it.

56:07.285 --> 56:09.401
And look what I became.

56:11.245 --> 56:12.598
Still,

56:14.045 --> 56:16.513
I have lived so many lives.

56:18.565 --> 56:20.840
It's time to find another one.

56:25.965 --> 56:27.921
(MACHINE BEEPING)

56:29.965 --> 56:31.557
They died.

56:31.645 --> 56:36.116
And I am sorry, Jack,
but you cannot just run away.

56:36.205 --> 56:38.116
You cannot run away.

56:38.885 --> 56:40.284
Oh, yes, I can.

56:41.605 --> 56:42.924
Just watch me.

57:08.165 --> 57:09.359
Let's go home, yeah?

57:15.085 --> 57:16.359
Yeah.

57:20.125 --> 57:21.638
Yeah.
