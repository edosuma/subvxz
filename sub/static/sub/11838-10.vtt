There it is.

00:06.607 --> 00:07.773

00:07.775 --> 00:10.876
>> my god, <i>thundergun express:</i>

00:10.878 --> 00:12.211
The unrated director's cut.

00:12.213 --> 00:13.712
>> 13 extra minutes of movie

00:13.714 --> 00:14.680
In this one.

00:14.682 --> 00:15.447
>> and it's unrated.

00:15.449 --> 00:16.782
They were not able to rate it.

00:16.784 --> 00:17.616
>> this is gonna be the best

00:17.618 --> 00:18.384
Thanksgiving ever.

00:18.386 --> 00:19.551
>> oh, yeah, absolutely, man.

00:19.553 --> 00:21.120
<i>Thundergun,</i> hoagies and four

00:21.122 --> 00:22.454
Extra seconds dedicated solely

00:22.456 --> 00:23.455
To the dong shot.

00:23.457 --> 00:24.356
Buddy, that's what

00:24.358 --> 00:25.190
I'm thankful for.

00:25.192 --> 00:26.025
>> so much better than

00:26.027 --> 00:26.859
A traditional thanksgiving.

00:26.861 --> 00:27.659
>> oh, yeah, dude, I hate

00:27.661 --> 00:28.293
Thanksgiving.

00:28.295 --> 00:29.194
What is that?

00:29.196 --> 00:29.862
What am I supposed

00:29.864 --> 00:30.796
To be thankful for exactly?

00:30.798 --> 00:31.997
Who am I meant to be thanking,

00:31.999 --> 00:32.631
Right?

00:32.633 --> 00:33.465
>> I've had to scratch

00:33.467 --> 00:34.233
And claw for everything

00:34.235 --> 00:34.867
I've got.

00:34.869 --> 00:35.667
If anything, I should be

00:35.669 --> 00:36.301
Thanking myself.

00:36.303 --> 00:37.903
>> yeah.

00:37.905 --> 00:39.471

Video.

00:41.075 --> 00:42.708
How may we help you?

00:42.710 --> 00:43.709
>> (groans) what are you guys

00:43.711 --> 00:44.710
Doing here?

00:44.712 --> 00:45.878
>> we own the store.

00:45.880 --> 00:47.713
We bought this bitch.

00:47.715 --> 00:48.881
>> we wanted to invest in an

00:48.883 --> 00:49.882
Emerging market.

00:49.884 --> 00:50.883
>> an emerging market?

00:50.885 --> 00:51.817
Video stores are a dying market.

00:51.819 --> 00:52.851
This is, like, one of the only

00:52.853 --> 00:54.486
>> then we're gonna corner that

00:54.488 --> 00:55.487
Market.

00:55.489 --> 00:56.155
>> okay. Whatever.

00:56.157 --> 00:57.156
Liam, what is on your eye?

00:57.158 --> 00:58.157
>> someone ate my eye at my

00:58.159 --> 00:59.158
Wedding.

00:59.160 --> 01:00.159
Don't you remember, man?

01:00.161 --> 01:01.160
>> the eyepatch is flesh-colored

01:01.162 --> 01:02.161
To make people less

01:02.163 --> 01:03.162
Uncomfortable.

01:03.164 --> 01:05.164
>> I'm way more uncomfortable.

01:05.166 --> 01:06.165
>> yeah, absolutely.

01:06.167 --> 01:07.166
You look like a man who was

01:07.168 --> 01:08.167
Born without an eye, which is

01:08.169 --> 01:09.168
Way creepier than a man who lost

01:09.170 --> 01:10.836
Just get a black eyepatch, you

01:10.838 --> 01:11.837
Know?

01:11.839 --> 01:12.838
Embrace it. Losing an eye is

01:12.840 --> 01:13.439
Badass.

01:13.441 --> 01:14.440
>> it's not badass.

01:14.442 --> 01:15.441
I have no depth perception!

01:15.443 --> 01:16.442
>> it's all your fault.

01:16.444 --> 01:17.443
>> what are you... How is it our

01:17.445 --> 01:19.078
What are you talking about?

01:19.080 --> 01:20.079
>> let's not get into a whole

01:20.081 --> 01:21.080
Thing about missing eyes and

01:21.082 --> 01:22.081
Whose fault they are.

01:22.083 --> 01:23.082
You know, we'll just rent the

01:23.084 --> 01:24.083
Video, and we'll be out of here.

01:24.085 --> 01:25.084
>> you are not renting shit.

01:25.086 --> 01:26.085
You are not welcome in this

01:26.087 --> 01:27.086
Store.

01:27.088 --> 01:28.187
Your video-renting days are

01:28.189 --> 01:29.188
Over!

01:29.190 --> 01:30.422
>> no, come on, don't do that,

01:30.424 --> 01:32.257
Dude.

01:32.259 --> 01:34.860
Oh...

01:34.862 --> 01:36.528
>> I-it's not even... It's not

01:36.530 --> 01:37.529
Even close.

01:37.531 --> 01:38.530
I mean, I...

01:38.532 --> 01:39.598
>> let me get that for you.

01:39.600 --> 01:40.599
>> thanks, man.

01:40.601 --> 01:42.367
>> don't cut... Don't...

01:42.369 --> 01:44.536
>> goddamn it.

01:46.272 --> 01:47.272
>> charlie: All right, look,

01:47.274 --> 01:48.273
Just pay the man already.

01:48.275 --> 01:49.274
We'll be done with it.

01:49.276 --> 01:50.275
It's freezing in there.

01:50.277 --> 01:51.276
>> frank: No can do, charlie.

01:51.278 --> 01:52.311
It's the principle of the thing.

01:52.313 --> 01:53.312
>> dee: You guys having a

01:53.314 --> 01:54.313
Principle fight?

01:54.315 --> 01:55.314
>> no, we're not having a

01:55.316 --> 01:56.982
We're having a heat fight, okay?

01:56.984 --> 01:58.050
'cause our heat's broken, and

01:58.052 --> 01:59.151
Hwang won't fix it until this

01:59.153 --> 02:00.219
Guy pays the rent.

02:00.221 --> 02:01.220
This guy's not gonna pay the

02:01.222 --> 02:02.121
Rent till hwang fixes the heat.

02:02.123 --> 02:03.055
So you got one of those snafus,

02:03.057 --> 02:03.956
Where you got old assholes...

02:03.958 --> 02:05.124
>> it's a deadlock.

02:05.126 --> 02:06.125
>> it's a deadlock of butting

02:06.127 --> 02:07.126
Heads.

02:07.128 --> 02:08.127
>> we got a disaster on our

02:08.129 --> 02:09.128
Hands, a disaster.

02:09.130 --> 02:10.129
>> the mcpoyles bought mahndo

02:10.131 --> 02:11.130
Video.

02:11.132 --> 02:12.131
They revoked our membership.

02:12.133 --> 02:13.232
>> you didn't get <i>thundergun?</i>

02:13.234 --> 02:14.233
>> we didn't get shit!

02:14.235 --> 02:16.001
>> aw... Hang on.

02:16.003 --> 02:17.336
Dee, why do our hoagies reek of

02:17.338 --> 02:18.337
Gasoline?

02:18.339 --> 02:19.471
>> maybe 'cause I got 'em at the

02:19.473 --> 02:20.472
Gas station, I guess.

02:20.474 --> 02:21.473
>> why?

02:21.475 --> 02:22.474
>> why didn't you get the ones

02:22.476 --> 02:23.642
We like from the wawa?

02:23.644 --> 02:24.676
>> because gail the snail works

02:24.678 --> 02:25.744
At the wawa, okay?

02:25.746 --> 02:26.812
And we got mad beef.

02:26.814 --> 02:27.813
She won't serve me.

02:27.815 --> 02:28.747
>> this is a mess.

02:28.749 --> 02:30.349
We can't get the sandwiches we

02:30.351 --> 02:31.450
Want, we can't get the videos we

02:31.452 --> 02:32.451
Want, my apartment's an icebox.

02:32.453 --> 02:33.452
Thanksgiving's gonna be ruined,

02:33.454 --> 02:35.087
>> it's not just thanksgiving,

02:35.089 --> 02:36.088
Pal.

02:36.090 --> 02:37.089
You know what the real problem

02:37.091 --> 02:38.757
We have too many beefs all over

02:38.759 --> 02:39.758
Town.

02:39.760 --> 02:40.759
It's jamming us up.

02:40.761 --> 02:41.760
>> we made a lot of enemies over

02:41.762 --> 02:42.761
The years.

02:42.763 --> 02:43.762
>> we have made enemies.

02:43.764 --> 02:44.763
>> we got to do something about

02:44.765 --> 02:45.931
This, guys, okay?

02:45.933 --> 02:48.333
So I say we use thanksgiving as

02:48.335 --> 02:49.868
An opportunity to squash some of

02:49.870 --> 02:52.938
Those beefs.

03:20.133 --> 03:21.133
>> all right, guys, this is

03:21.135 --> 03:22.134
Really coming together.

03:22.136 --> 03:23.135
It's looking good.

03:23.137 --> 03:24.136
You know... You know, this was

03:24.138 --> 03:25.137
The original meaning of

03:25.139 --> 03:26.138
Thanksgiving anyway.

03:26.140 --> 03:27.139
The pilgrims and indians had

03:27.141 --> 03:28.140
Beef.

03:28.142 --> 03:29.141
So what did they do?

03:29.143 --> 03:30.142
They got together, they sat at a

03:30.144 --> 03:31.143
Table, they ate some delicious

03:31.145 --> 03:32.144
Food and they squashed that

03:32.146 --> 03:33.145
Beef.

03:33.147 --> 03:34.146
And that's exactly what we're

03:34.148 --> 03:35.147
Gonna do.

03:35.149 --> 03:36.148
Mac and I are gonna squash the

03:36.150 --> 03:37.149
Mcpoyle beef, you guys are gonna

03:37.151 --> 03:38.150
Squash hwang...

03:38.152 --> 03:39.218
>> and you guys are gonna squash

03:39.220 --> 03:39.985
With bruce.

03:39.987 --> 03:40.652
>> what?

03:40.654 --> 03:42.221
>> bruce mathis, I invited him.

03:42.223 --> 03:42.854
>> what?!

03:42.856 --> 03:43.488
>> what? What?

03:43.490 --> 03:44.323
>> why would you do that?

03:44.325 --> 03:45.257
>> because he is your dad, and

03:45.259 --> 03:46.992
Thanksgiving is a holiday for

03:46.994 --> 03:47.993
Families.

03:47.995 --> 03:49.561
I also invited charlie's mom, my

03:49.563 --> 03:50.562
Mom and my dad, but they didn't

03:50.564 --> 03:51.563
Want to come.

03:51.565 --> 03:52.564
>> so just bruce?

03:52.566 --> 03:53.565
>> you know what, it's okay.

03:53.567 --> 03:54.566
We'll-we'll manage very

03:54.568 --> 03:55.567
Carefully, and it'll be fine.

03:55.569 --> 03:56.568
Hey, maybe we can squeeze some

03:56.570 --> 03:57.569
Money out of the guy.

03:57.571 --> 03:58.570
>> I'm-I'm confused though.

03:58.572 --> 03:59.571
In this whole scenario with the

03:59.573 --> 04:00.672
Pilgrim and the indians, which

04:00.674 --> 04:01.773
One are we?

04:01.775 --> 04:03.008
>> the pilgrims.

04:03.010 --> 04:04.009
They came out on top.

04:04.011 --> 04:05.010
>> I don't know about that,

04:05.012 --> 04:06.912
The indians, they've got sports

04:06.914 --> 04:07.913
Teams, they've got casinos.

04:07.915 --> 04:08.914
They're a very celebrated

04:08.916 --> 04:09.915
People.

04:09.917 --> 04:10.916
>> yeah, that's true, actually.

04:10.918 --> 04:11.917
You don't see people walking

04:11.919 --> 04:12.918
Around with the tall hat with a

04:12.920 --> 04:13.919
Buckle on the front.

04:13.921 --> 04:15.020
>> makes no difference though in

04:15.022 --> 04:16.288
Our scenario with what we're

04:16.290 --> 04:17.289
Trying to accomplish here, okay?

04:17.291 --> 04:18.357
They buried the hatchet.

04:18.359 --> 04:19.524
That's what they did, and that's

04:19.526 --> 04:20.525
What we're gonna do.

04:20.527 --> 04:21.760
Okay, so, to that end, here's

04:21.762 --> 04:23.462
The plan: Once the guests

04:23.464 --> 04:25.364
Arrive, we will ply them with

04:25.366 --> 04:26.965
Liquor and then I will present

04:26.967 --> 04:28.300
To them this peace treaty that I

04:28.302 --> 04:29.968
Will have them sign.

04:29.970 --> 04:30.969
>> why do you always want people

04:30.971 --> 04:32.037
To sign creepy documents?

04:32.039 --> 04:33.939
>> (laughs) well, frank, once

04:33.941 --> 04:34.940
Something's in writing, that

04:34.942 --> 04:35.941
Means it's set in stone.

04:35.943 --> 04:36.942
Then no one can do anything to

04:36.944 --> 04:37.943
Stop me.

04:37.945 --> 04:38.944
>> when do you want me to serve

04:38.946 --> 04:39.945
The squash and the beef?

04:39.947 --> 04:40.946
>> s-so we're literally serving

04:40.948 --> 04:41.947
Squash and beef?

04:41.949 --> 04:42.914
>> you said we're squashing

04:42.916 --> 04:44.549
I thought it would be part of

04:44.551 --> 04:45.550
The ceremony to have squash and

04:45.552 --> 04:46.551
Beef.

04:46.553 --> 04:47.552
>> yeah, it's all about the

04:47.554 --> 04:49.221
That's why I got this bucket of

04:49.223 --> 04:50.222
Dirt and a hatchet, so we can

04:50.224 --> 04:51.223
Have a ceremonial burying of the

04:51.225 --> 04:52.224
Hatchet.

04:52.226 --> 04:53.225
>> right. And after we do that,

04:53.227 --> 04:54.226
We're going to wipe the slate

04:54.228 --> 04:55.227
Clean.

04:55.229 --> 04:56.395
>> wait, no, guys, look, this is

04:56.397 --> 04:58.130
All very on the nose and totally

04:58.132 --> 04:59.731
Unnecessary.

04:59.733 --> 05:01.166
>> hwang: Where's food?

05:01.168 --> 05:02.167
>> walk right in, why don't you,

05:02.169 --> 05:03.168
Hwang?

05:03.170 --> 05:04.169
>> thanksgiving, food.

05:04.171 --> 05:04.903
>> yeah, thanksgiving...

05:04.905 --> 05:05.904
>> thanksgiving, yeah, go sit

05:05.906 --> 05:06.905
Down.

05:06.907 --> 05:07.739
>> have a seat, have a seat,

05:07.741 --> 05:08.740
Man!

05:08.742 --> 05:09.741
>> what do you live in, a barn?

05:09.743 --> 05:10.475
>> have a seat, hwang.

05:10.477 --> 05:11.476
>> guys, listen, regroup,

05:11.478 --> 05:12.477
Regroup.

05:12.479 --> 05:13.645
Let's put on some music, lighten

05:13.647 --> 05:15.647
The mood and get this party

05:15.649 --> 05:17.015
Started.

05:17.017 --> 05:18.183
(tom tom club's "genius of love"

05:18.185 --> 05:20.585
Playing)

05:25.425 --> 05:26.425
>> dee.

05:26.427 --> 05:27.025
>> hmm?

05:27.027 --> 05:28.026
>> go break the ice.

05:28.028 --> 05:29.027
>> what?

05:29.029 --> 05:29.661
>> yeah.

11:09.870 --> 11:11.136
Frank, you.

11:11.138 --> 11:14.873
>> oh, as a matter of fact...

11:14.875 --> 11:16.141
I could give the whole month's

11:16.143 --> 11:17.342
Rent right here.

11:17.344 --> 11:18.510
>> well, that'd be... Good.

11:18.512 --> 11:19.711
>> I'll take it.

11:19.713 --> 11:20.879
>> yeah, but I'm not gonna do

11:20.881 --> 11:22.147
It, because I'm not gonna let

11:22.149 --> 11:23.348
You beat me, because you're a

11:23.350 --> 11:24.516
Lousy son of a bitch.

11:24.518 --> 11:25.717
>> you're a dog!

11:25.719 --> 11:26.851
>> I'm a dog, you're a dog, huh?

11:26.853 --> 11:27.719
>> wait, wait, wait, wait.

11:27.721 --> 11:28.720
>> how's that? Huh?

11:28.722 --> 11:29.721
>> you're a fire dog!

11:29.723 --> 11:30.722
>> plenty more where this came

11:30.724 --> 11:31.890
From.

11:31.892 --> 11:32.891
I could heat that apartment all

11:32.893 --> 11:33.892
Winter, huh? You want it? Aah...

11:33.894 --> 11:35.160
>> yeah, yeah, yeah, fire dog.

11:35.162 --> 11:36.361
>> aw!

11:36.363 --> 11:37.328
>> you're trying to burn me!

11:37.330 --> 11:38.396
>> just give us an eye.

11:38.398 --> 11:39.564
You don't need both of them.

11:39.566 --> 11:40.732
>> I only have one good working

11:40.734 --> 11:42.000
Eye.

11:42.002 --> 11:43.001
>> yeah, but I think it might be

11:43.003 --> 11:44.002
Better if you're blind anyway.

11:44.004 --> 11:45.003
You know, it's gonna heighten

11:45.005 --> 11:46.004
All your other senses.

11:46.006 --> 11:47.005
>> let me think about it.

11:47.007 --> 11:48.006
I'll think about it.

11:48.008 --> 11:49.007
>> okay, give it some thought.

11:49.009 --> 11:50.008
Give it some thought.

11:50.010 --> 11:51.009
>> I'll think about it.

11:51.011 --> 11:52.010
>> all right, well, we'll work

11:52.012 --> 11:53.011
That angle.

11:53.013 --> 11:53.912
>> all right, just...

11:53.914 --> 11:55.180
(doorbell rings)

11:55.182 --> 11:56.081
>> ooh, maybe that's bruce.

11:56.083 --> 11:57.082
>> oh, yeah. Hey, how'd you get

11:57.084 --> 11:58.083
Him down here anyway?

11:58.085 --> 11:58.917
>> I told him that his kids

11:58.919 --> 11:59.751
Wanted to see him for

11:59.753 --> 12:00.719
Thanksgiving, and that you guys

12:00.721 --> 12:01.586
Wanted to be one big happy

12:01.588 --> 12:02.554
Family again.

12:02.556 --> 12:03.755
>> oh, nice.

12:03.757 --> 12:04.923
>> hey.

12:04.925 --> 12:05.924
>> who's this jabroni?

12:05.926 --> 12:06.858
>> I have no idea.

12:06.860 --> 12:07.726
Slam the door on his face.

12:07.728 --> 12:08.593
>> see you, bozo.

12:08.595 --> 12:09.561
>> whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait.

12:09.563 --> 12:10.562
Actually, I know who this guy

12:10.564 --> 12:11.563
Is. Holy shit!

12:11.565 --> 12:12.564
Dude, this is the guy that frank

12:12.566 --> 12:13.565
And dee mistook for bruce, and

12:13.567 --> 12:14.566
Frank got that bad intel, so

12:14.568 --> 12:15.567
They went to his apartment,

12:15.569 --> 12:16.568
Instead of bruce's apartment.

12:16.570 --> 12:17.569
>> and then we blew up his car.

12:17.571 --> 12:18.570
>> blew the shit out of his car.

12:18.572 --> 12:19.571
>> oh, my god.

12:19.573 --> 12:20.572
>> wait a minute.

12:20.574 --> 12:21.773
That was you guys?

12:21.775 --> 12:22.941
>> huh? No.

12:22.943 --> 12:24.042
I don't even know what you're

12:24.044 --> 12:25.210
Talking about.

12:25.212 --> 12:26.411
>> uh...

12:26.413 --> 12:27.412
>> happy thanksgiving.

12:27.414 --> 12:28.580
>> yeah, yeah.

12:28.582 --> 12:29.581
>> wait, wait. Please.

12:29.583 --> 12:30.582
Are my kids in there?

12:30.584 --> 12:31.583
Somebody wrote me a note and

12:31.585 --> 12:32.584
Said that my kids wanted to see

12:32.586 --> 12:33.785
Me?

12:33.787 --> 12:34.886
I haven't seen 'em since my wife

12:34.888 --> 12:35.954
Left me.

12:35.956 --> 12:36.955
Are they in here? Sabrina?

12:36.957 --> 12:37.956
>> oh, this is bad.

12:37.958 --> 12:39.224
>> yeah. Oh.

12:39.226 --> 12:40.225
>> marco? Daddy's here.

12:40.227 --> 12:41.426
>> oh, my god.

12:41.428 --> 12:42.427
We really opened up a can of

12:42.429 --> 12:43.595
Worms.

12:43.597 --> 12:44.596
>> it's a bit messy.

12:44.598 --> 12:45.597
The good news is, seems that the

12:45.599 --> 12:46.598
Kids thing took his mind off the

12:46.600 --> 12:47.599
Car thing, so, maybe it'll work

12:47.601 --> 12:48.800
Itself out.

12:48.802 --> 12:49.968
>> okay, good.

12:49.970 --> 12:51.236
>> all right.

12:51.238 --> 12:52.437
>> bill: Mac.

12:52.439 --> 12:53.605
>> hey.

12:53.607 --> 12:54.606
>> hey, thanks for calling, man.

12:54.608 --> 12:55.607
So, where are the kids?

12:55.609 --> 12:56.608
I can't wait to see those little

12:56.610 --> 12:57.776
Rug rats.

12:57.778 --> 12:58.777
It's been forever.

12:58.779 --> 12:59.778
>> I'm sure they're around

12:59.780 --> 13:00.779
Somewhere.

13:00.781 --> 13:01.780
Go ahead and mingle, and maybe

13:01.782 --> 13:02.781
You'll find 'em.

13:02.783 --> 13:03.748
>> my kids aren't really here,

13:03.750 --> 13:04.749
Are they?

13:04.751 --> 13:05.750
>> uh... No.

13:05.752 --> 13:06.651
>> no. No, I lied about that.

13:06.653 --> 13:07.619
>> thank god. Let's get

13:07.621 --> 13:08.620
Shit-housed, right, guys?

13:08.622 --> 13:09.621
>> what a piece of shit that guy

13:09.623 --> 13:10.822
Is.

13:10.824 --> 13:11.790
>> yeah, he's a real piece of

13:11.792 --> 13:12.791
Shit, yeah.

13:12.793 --> 13:13.792
>> oh, my god.

13:13.794 --> 13:14.759
>> what the hell is ponderosa

13:14.761 --> 13:15.760
Doing here?

13:15.762 --> 13:16.795
>> well, he's the one that's

13:16.797 --> 13:17.796
Responsible for liam's eye, so

13:17.798 --> 13:18.797
We figured, you know, he shows

13:18.799 --> 13:19.664
Up, it shifts the blame from us

13:19.666 --> 13:20.665
To him, and, worst case

13:20.667 --> 13:21.666
Scenario, they'll take his eye.

13:21.668 --> 13:22.634
>> oh, my god, this is getting

13:22.636 --> 13:23.635
Way too confusing.

13:23.637 --> 13:24.636
We got too many beefs.

13:24.638 --> 13:25.637
I can't keep up.

13:25.639 --> 13:26.638
>> god, dee, we got it.

13:26.640 --> 13:27.605
Honk, honk, honk, honk, honk.

13:27.607 --> 13:28.606
Too many beefs, we got it.

13:28.608 --> 13:29.674
>> I'm not honking. I'm just...

13:29.676 --> 13:30.642
I'm expressing something...

13:30.644 --> 13:31.676
>> I'll admit it, it's getting

13:31.678 --> 13:32.644
Confusing, there's a lot of

13:32.646 --> 13:33.845
People here.

13:33.847 --> 13:34.846
>> see?

13:34.848 --> 13:35.847
>> I'll take some of the blame

13:35.849 --> 13:36.781
For that. I did invite...

13:36.783 --> 13:37.782
>> let us take the lead.

13:37.784 --> 13:38.783
We got it, we got it.

13:38.785 --> 13:39.984
>> okay.

13:39.986 --> 13:40.985
>> can't get it to stay.

13:40.987 --> 13:44.222
There you go.

13:49.361 --> 13:51.529
(indistinct chatter)

13:51.531 --> 13:52.764
>> hi, uh, everybody, I'd like

13:52.766 --> 13:53.765
To say something, please.

13:53.767 --> 13:54.766
Uh, could I have your attention,

13:54.768 --> 13:56.367
I'd like to say something, yeah.

13:56.369 --> 13:58.269
Um, so, the pilgrims hated the

13:58.271 --> 13:59.270
Indians and the indians, they

13:59.272 --> 14:00.772
Despised the pilgrims.

14:00.774 --> 14:01.773
>> yeah.

14:01.775 --> 14:02.774
>> but nonetheless, on

14:02.776 --> 14:04.108
Thanksgiving, they got together,

14:04.110 --> 14:05.677
Right, and it wasn't about

14:05.679 --> 14:07.212
Apologizing to each other.

14:07.214 --> 14:08.213
"aw..."

14:08.215 --> 14:09.781
It wasn't about admitting guilt.

14:09.783 --> 14:11.282
Won't do that. Okay?

14:11.284 --> 14:13.184
It was just about making the

14:13.186 --> 14:14.285
Peace-- that was all that it was

14:14.287 --> 14:15.286
About.

14:15.288 --> 14:16.621
And if the indians knew how to

14:16.623 --> 14:17.689
Sign shit, they probably

14:17.691 --> 14:18.790
Would've signed a peace treaty.

14:18.792 --> 14:19.891
Right? So that's what we're

14:19.893 --> 14:21.559
We're gonna make peace with each

14:21.561 --> 14:22.560
Other, and we're gonna get it in

14:22.562 --> 14:23.561
Writing.

14:23.563 --> 14:24.562
All right? Is everybody amenable

14:24.564 --> 14:25.563
To that?

14:25.565 --> 14:26.731
Sound good?

14:26.733 --> 14:28.466
>> great, uh, so we'd like to

14:28.468 --> 14:31.069
Begin with bill ponderosa.

14:31.071 --> 14:32.070
>> yes.

14:32.072 --> 14:34.405
(applause)

14:34.407 --> 14:35.473
>> it's not... There's no need

14:35.475 --> 14:36.474
To clap.

14:36.476 --> 14:37.475
It's not a clapping event.

14:37.477 --> 14:38.476
>> no. Right. So...

14:38.478 --> 14:40.478
Okay, so, um, bill, do you have

14:40.480 --> 14:41.546
Something you'd like to admit to

14:41.548 --> 14:42.714
Someone here?

14:42.716 --> 14:43.815
>> yes, actually, I do.

14:43.817 --> 14:45.316
Uh, I once broke into dee's

14:45.318 --> 14:47.252
Apartment and sniffed on her

14:47.254 --> 14:48.820
Panties.

14:48.822 --> 14:51.723
>> what? Goddamn it! Beef!

14:51.725 --> 14:53.258
No, I got beef with that.

14:53.260 --> 14:54.325
>> uh, can we, um... Just stay

14:54.327 --> 14:55.493
On track.

14:55.495 --> 14:56.828
Um... Bill, is there something

14:56.830 --> 14:58.830
You want to say to the mcpoyles?

14:58.832 --> 15:02.267
>> oh, um... Hey, hey.

15:02.269 --> 15:04.269
I love that painted-on eye, man.

15:04.271 --> 15:05.270
That is fun.

15:05.272 --> 15:06.838
>> no. No, wait. No, no.

15:06.840 --> 15:09.574
Okay. No, no, no.

15:09.576 --> 15:10.742
All right, hey, hey, hey!

15:10.744 --> 15:11.743
Everybody stop clapping.

15:11.745 --> 15:13.278
All right, liam, bill's the one

15:13.280 --> 15:15.246
Who put bath salts in the punch

15:15.248 --> 15:16.247
At your wedding, all right?

15:16.249 --> 15:17.282
He's the one who is responsible

15:17.284 --> 15:18.449
For your empty eyehole.

15:18.451 --> 15:19.617
>> is this true, man?

15:19.619 --> 15:20.618
>> maybe. I...

15:20.620 --> 15:21.619
The only thing I remember from

15:21.621 --> 15:22.620
That night is my sponsor frank

15:22.622 --> 15:23.621
Giving me the green light to get

15:23.623 --> 15:24.622
Shit-housed.

15:24.624 --> 15:25.623
>> that's true.

15:25.625 --> 15:26.257
>> that happened.

15:26.259 --> 15:27.258
>> I'll back that up.

15:27.260 --> 15:28.359
>> then it's your fault.

15:28.361 --> 15:29.527
You owe my brother an eye!

15:29.529 --> 15:30.528
>> all right, settle down!

15:30.530 --> 15:31.529
Settle... Take it easy, all

15:31.531 --> 15:33.131
Don't drag him into your beef

15:33.133 --> 15:34.132
'cause I need him to focus on

15:34.134 --> 15:35.767
>> hey, frank, I'm giving this

15:35.769 --> 15:36.868
Guy a handy under the table.

15:36.870 --> 15:38.703
Are you jealous?

15:38.705 --> 15:40.305
(slurping sound)

15:40.307 --> 15:42.373
>> she's mashing it.

15:42.375 --> 15:44.142
>> she does that.

15:44.144 --> 15:46.044
>> I'm very aroused.

15:46.046 --> 15:47.946
Very good.

15:47.948 --> 15:49.380
>> look, I'm-I'm sorry.

15:49.382 --> 15:50.381
Which one of you knows my

15:50.383 --> 15:51.382
Ex-wife and when are my kids

15:51.384 --> 15:52.383
Getting here?

15:52.385 --> 15:53.451
>> they'll get here. Just...

15:53.453 --> 15:54.452
>> who's this jabroni?

15:54.454 --> 15:55.620
>> uh, this is the gentleman who

15:55.622 --> 15:57.221
We mistook for bruce mathis.

15:57.223 --> 15:58.957
>> right, yep, and then we blew

15:58.959 --> 16:00.224
Up his car.

16:00.226 --> 16:01.225
>> don't say that!

16:01.227 --> 16:02.293
>> a-all of this, and it was you

16:02.295 --> 16:03.394
Guys.

16:03.396 --> 16:04.395
You owe me a car.

16:04.397 --> 16:05.630
>> whoa, easy, man!

16:05.632 --> 16:07.332
That's a big leap right there.

16:07.334 --> 16:08.566
>> buddy, buddy, um, what's the

16:08.568 --> 16:09.567
Deal with your kids?

16:09.569 --> 16:10.568
Y-you haven't see 'em in a

16:10.570 --> 16:11.169
While.

16:11.171 --> 16:12.170
Did you do something?

16:12.172 --> 16:13.171
Is it... Was it your fault?

16:13.173 --> 16:14.572
>> oh. I have a horrible drug

16:14.574 --> 16:15.573
Problem.

16:15.575 --> 16:17.342
>> ooh, I hear you.

16:17.344 --> 16:18.409
I know that game, huh?

16:18.411 --> 16:19.677
You want to do a bump here?

16:19.679 --> 16:20.812
>> yeah, of course I want a

16:20.814 --> 16:21.813
Bump.

16:21.815 --> 16:22.814
>> I'll have a few of those

16:22.816 --> 16:24.415
Delicious nose clams.

16:24.417 --> 16:26.317
>> frank, no, come on.

16:26.319 --> 16:27.752
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:27.754 --> 16:28.753
>> don't clap for that!

16:28.755 --> 16:29.754
>> what? I can't have squash?

16:29.756 --> 16:30.688
I can't have blow?

16:30.690 --> 16:31.422
>> we need you to focus!

16:31.424 --> 16:32.190
Sign the damn treaty!

16:32.192 --> 16:33.091
All right, you know what, hwang,

16:33.093 --> 16:33.825
You sign the treaty.

16:33.827 --> 16:34.525
>> I'll sign it.

16:34.527 --> 16:35.593
>> oh, gross! Don't touch me

16:35.595 --> 16:36.260
With that hand!

16:36.262 --> 16:37.195
>> put your hand over here.

16:37.197 --> 16:38.096
I'll take sloppy seconds.

16:38.098 --> 16:38.863
>> absolutely not.

16:38.865 --> 16:39.864
>> mash me, baby. Mash me.

16:39.866 --> 16:40.999
>> no mashing at the table!

16:41.001 --> 16:42.266
Stop mashing, all right?

16:42.268 --> 16:43.334
Come on. Goddamn it, frank, I'm

16:43.336 --> 16:44.335
Starting to think I have beef

16:44.337 --> 16:44.936
With <i>you!</i>

16:44.938 --> 16:45.937
>> yeah, us, too!

16:45.939 --> 16:47.372
>> okay, I have an idea.

16:47.374 --> 16:48.506
It's time now to wipe the slate

16:48.508 --> 16:49.507
Clean.

16:49.509 --> 16:50.508
>> no, you said we were gonna do

16:50.510 --> 16:51.509
The hatchet thing first!

16:51.511 --> 16:52.543
>> don't worry about the hatchet

16:52.545 --> 16:54.178
That was an unsanctioned move.

16:54.180 --> 16:55.179
>> well, none of these moves are

16:55.181 --> 16:56.781
We got to do something else!

16:56.783 --> 16:59.250
(overlapping arguing)

17:04.790 --> 17:06.791
>> food fight! Food fight!

17:06.793 --> 17:07.859
>> I guess!

17:07.861 --> 17:09.460
>> what?!

17:09.462 --> 17:10.962
No!

17:10.964 --> 17:14.565
(overlapping shouting, grunting)

17:18.871 --> 17:21.472
>> sign the treaty!

17:21.474 --> 17:23.975
>> you owe me an eye, frank!

17:23.977 --> 17:25.977
(grunts)

17:25.979 --> 17:28.413
(screaming)

17:33.419 --> 17:34.585
>> oh, shit.

17:34.587 --> 17:36.320
>> no, no, no, no. (grunts)

17:36.322 --> 17:37.555
Uh, this was a bad idea.

17:37.557 --> 17:38.556
>> we stirred up too much

17:38.558 --> 17:39.557
Conflict.

17:39.559 --> 17:41.159
>> yeah. It smells like smoke.

17:41.161 --> 17:42.160
Is something burning?

17:42.162 --> 17:43.161
>> I think it's coming from your

17:43.163 --> 17:44.162
Room, dude.

17:44.164 --> 17:47.665
>> what?!

17:47.667 --> 17:48.833
My room's on fire.

17:48.835 --> 17:49.834
Why is my room on fire?

17:49.836 --> 17:50.835
>> I may have started a money

17:50.837 --> 17:51.836
Fire.

17:51.838 --> 17:52.837
>> why would you start a fire in

17:52.839 --> 17:54.505
>> I don't know, I don't know.

17:54.507 --> 17:55.506
We got to think, we got to

17:55.508 --> 17:56.174
Think.

17:56.176 --> 17:57.575
Think, think.

17:57.577 --> 17:59.444
I've got an idea.

17:59.446 --> 18:01.846
(arguing in apartment)

18:01.848 --> 18:02.914
>> so we're just gonna lock them

18:02.916 --> 18:04.849
>> they're definitely gonna burn

18:04.851 --> 18:06.517
>> okay, guys, nobody's gonna

18:06.519 --> 18:07.185
Burn, all right?

18:07.187 --> 18:08.186
There's a fire escape.

18:08.188 --> 18:09.187
We'll call 911. We just need to

18:09.189 --> 18:10.188
Buy a little time so we can get

18:10.190 --> 18:10.855
The hell out of here.

18:10.857 --> 18:11.856
>> I feel like we're just

18:11.858 --> 18:12.857
Creating more beef.

18:12.859 --> 18:13.858
>> which we will not resolve.

18:13.860 --> 18:15.126
Beefs are best left simmering

18:15.128 --> 18:16.127
Under the surface-- I've learned

18:16.129 --> 18:17.795
>> the best thing to do with a

18:17.797 --> 18:18.796
Beef is jam it deep down inside

18:18.798 --> 18:19.797
And then press forward.

18:19.799 --> 18:20.798
>> what are we gonna do now?

18:20.800 --> 18:21.799
>> you know, we could just buy

18:21.801 --> 18:22.800
<i>Thundergun</i> and go to a

18:22.802 --> 18:23.434
Different wawa.

18:23.436 --> 18:24.435
>> yeah, it's a little

18:24.437 --> 18:25.436
Inconvenient, but it's better

18:25.438 --> 18:26.437
Than facing our problems.

18:26.439 --> 18:27.438
>> yeah, or saying we're sorry,

18:27.440 --> 18:28.439
Which I'm not doing.

18:28.441 --> 18:29.373
>> hell, no, I don't do that.

18:29.375 --> 18:30.374
>> all right, you want to go

18:30.376 --> 18:31.375
Back to my place, get some

18:31.377 --> 18:32.043
Blankets, bundle up?

18:32.045 --> 18:33.044
Just us? No one else?

18:33.046 --> 18:34.212
>> that's what I'm thankful for.

18:34.214 --> 18:35.213
We don't need to get along with

18:35.215 --> 18:36.214
Anybody else-- we got each

18:36.216 --> 18:37.815
>> yeah, screw everybody else.

18:37.817 --> 18:38.816
>> I hate people who are

18:38.818 --> 18:39.984
Different than me, you know?

18:39.986 --> 18:40.885
Why pretend?

18:40.887 --> 18:41.786
>> (inside): There's a fire

18:41.788 --> 18:42.553
Escape right here.

18:42.555 --> 18:43.154
(glass shatters)

18:43.156 --> 18:43.988
>> fire escape.

18:43.990 --> 18:45.656
Out the window.

18:45.658 --> 18:46.657
(clamoring)

18:46.659 --> 18:47.658
>> who's got me? Man down.

18:47.660 --> 18:48.659
I right back here, guys.
