01:02.427 --> 01:04.561
Perhaps you could work
a little faster.

01:04.563 --> 01:06.533
Perhaps if you hadn't
tripped the damn alarm.

01:09.567 --> 01:11.635
Pamela, we are out of time.

01:11.637 --> 01:13.136
The police will be here soon.

Or worse...

01:15.441 --> 01:17.641
Batman, I know, I know!

01:17.643 --> 01:19.142
But it's like trying to find

01:19.144 --> 01:21.513

Nothing was physically stolen.

03:26.938 --> 03:28.604
Obviously.

03:28.606 --> 03:30.673
There was no effort
to minimize collateral.

03:30.675 --> 03:32.508
This was about information.

03:32.510 --> 03:34.043
There's no way Poison Ivy

03:34.045 --> 03:36.380
could've accessed
S.T.A.R. Labs' secure data.

03:36.382 --> 03:38.347
Got it.

03:38.349 --> 03:39.882
Here's the file they copied.

03:39.884 --> 03:41.554
Looks like this is the only
thing they cared about.

03:44.389 --> 03:45.788
Oh, no.

03:45.790 --> 03:47.323
Holland.

03:47.325 --> 03:48.659
"Holland."

03:48.661 --> 03:50.661
Why does that
sound so familiar?

03:50.663 --> 03:51.831
Be my guest.

03:57.735 --> 04:00.637
BATMAN: Alec Holland was working
on a bio-restorative formula

04:00.639 --> 04:02.773
to turn deserts into forests.

04:02.775 --> 04:04.840
(TYPING)

04:04.842 --> 04:09.012
Until a saboteur's bomb
destroyed that dream.

04:09.014 --> 04:11.947
His body engulfed in the
burning experimental compound,

04:11.949 --> 04:14.483
Holland tried to
douse the flames.

04:14.485 --> 04:17.421
The chemicals reacted
with the surrounding bayou.

04:17.423 --> 04:18.992
His entire
physiognomy changed.

04:20.459 --> 04:22.358
Holland was
transformed into...

04:22.360 --> 04:24.026
- Swamp Thing.
- That's it!

04:24.028 --> 04:25.529
That's what attacked me.

04:25.531 --> 04:26.531
Not quite.

04:28.834 --> 04:30.399
BATMAN: This is Jason Woodrue,

04:30.401 --> 04:32.836
aka the Floronic Man.

04:32.838 --> 04:34.404
Terrific.

04:34.406 --> 04:36.341
Poison Ivy teaming up
with Jason Woodrue.

04:37.009 --> 04:38.774
We're in for a ride.

04:38.776 --> 04:40.976
I see two
immediate objectives.

04:40.978 --> 04:42.348
If you'll excuse us.

04:45.918 --> 04:48.885
A, figure out what Ivy
and Woodrue were up to...

04:48.887 --> 04:51.788
And B, find out where
the green team is hiding out.

04:51.790 --> 04:54.858
I'll take A. I have a hunch
I need to look into.

04:54.860 --> 04:55.959
You take B.

04:55.961 --> 04:57.360
Check previous addresses,

04:57.362 --> 04:58.831

04:59.630 --> 05:00.766
Oh, crap.

05:01.466 --> 05:02.598
Right.

We need Harley Quinn.

05:04.870 --> 05:06.736
Last I heard,
Harley went off the grid

05:06.738 --> 05:08.105
after she got out on parole.

05:08.107 --> 05:09.906
No one's heard a thing since.

05:09.908 --> 05:11.108
Rumor is she's gone straight,

05:11.110 --> 05:12.976
but also, just plain gone.

05:12.978 --> 05:15.077
No one disappears
without a trace.

05:15.079 --> 05:16.512
Someone knows something.

05:16.514 --> 05:18.081
Someone always does.

05:18.083 --> 05:20.553
BATMAN: It's just a matter of
shaking the right tree.

Hey, thanks again
for helping us out

05:29.394 --> 05:30.629

05:34.565 --> 05:36.500
Wouldn't say no
to a slice of that pie,

05:36.502 --> 05:37.502
you know what I mean?

05:41.706 --> 05:44.039
So, what can I do for you,
Batman?

05:44.041 --> 05:45.074
A lot going on today,

05:45.076 --> 05:47.411
but I can spare a few minutes.

05:47.413 --> 05:49.782
A man was abducted
from his home two days ago.

05:50.548 --> 05:51.950
Harold Goldblum.

05:53.584 --> 05:55.017
Stupid hand.

05:55.019 --> 05:56.820
Henderson!

05:56.822 --> 05:58.788
How do you
even know about that?

05:58.790 --> 06:00.690
We've got a total
media lockdown.

06:00.692 --> 06:03.959
Let's just say I've got eyes
and ears everywhere, Sarge.

06:03.961 --> 06:05.695
Hacking the
A.R.G.U.S. computer

06:05.697 --> 06:08.565
is a federal crime, Batman.

06:08.567 --> 06:10.800
Goldblum is a former
professor of chemistry

06:10.802 --> 06:12.569
at Metropolis University.

06:12.571 --> 06:13.836
Spent 15 years

06:13.838 --> 06:16.740
heading up GothCorp
Chemicals' R&D division.

06:16.742 --> 06:19.074
Most recently, he's been
working for the NSA,

06:19.076 --> 06:21.644
specializing in
biological warfare.

06:21.646 --> 06:23.846
He was their top mind
in biology,

06:23.848 --> 06:25.582
botany and toxicology.

06:25.584 --> 06:27.620
I need to know
what he was working on.

06:28.887 --> 06:30.820
That'll be all, Henderson.

06:30.822 --> 06:31.858
Right, Sarge.

06:32.723 --> 06:33.524
Big fan.

06:36.495 --> 06:39.462
I'm sorry, Batman,
that's classified.

06:39.464 --> 06:40.997
My hands are tied.

06:40.999 --> 06:43.666
Strange that you would
put it just that way.

06:43.668 --> 06:45.202
Why?

06:45.204 --> 06:47.070
A fringe hacker group
recently accessed information

06:47.072 --> 06:49.238
about key
A.R.G.U.S. employees.

06:49.240 --> 06:52.742
Some of them seem to be
engaged in, shall we say...

06:52.744 --> 06:55.047
Questionable
nocturnal activities.

06:56.048 --> 06:58.081
Are you blackmailing me?

06:58.083 --> 07:00.716
I'm explaining
that I can help stop a crime

07:00.718 --> 07:02.088
in exchange
for some information.

07:04.021 --> 07:05.721
Fine.

07:05.723 --> 07:07.656
But for the record,
what Mistress Ilsa does for me

07:07.658 --> 07:09.692
is considered therapy...

07:09.694 --> 07:11.995
In some countries.

07:11.997 --> 07:13.630
SARGE: It's an odd case.

07:13.632 --> 07:15.899
No ransom demands,
political requests, nothing.

07:15.901 --> 07:17.601
He just vanished.

07:17.603 --> 07:19.536
Whoever took the guy,
they either killed him,

07:19.538 --> 07:20.637
or they're keeping him alive

07:20.639 --> 07:22.505
for reason or reasons unknown.

07:22.507 --> 07:23.639
Any leads?

07:23.641 --> 07:24.908
Nothing viable.

07:24.910 --> 07:26.813
The investigation
is at a dead end.

07:28.213 --> 07:30.779
Goldblum's field of expertise

07:30.781 --> 07:34.050
is man-made,
pandemic terrorist attacks.

07:34.052 --> 07:38.053
Anthrax, Ebola, flesh-eating
bacteria, you know?

07:38.055 --> 07:40.190
Yes, I do.

07:40.192 --> 07:44.060
In fact, he's the world's
leading expert on the subject.

07:44.062 --> 07:46.930
Jesus, the stuff
that guy knows.

07:46.932 --> 07:48.798
I don't mean to be callous,

07:48.800 --> 07:50.670
but a part of me hopes
they just kill them.

07:57.942 --> 07:59.074
No, sorry.

07:59.076 --> 08:00.276
Uh-uh.

08:00.278 --> 08:01.545
Nah, man.

08:01.547 --> 08:03.079
Mmm, no.

08:03.081 --> 08:04.247
Haven't seen her.

08:04.249 --> 08:06.082
I would've liked to.

08:33.711 --> 08:36.011

08:36.014 --> 08:37.847
on 3rd Street.

08:37.849 --> 08:40.186
Morty, that was
two years ago...

08:40.985 --> 08:42.221
In Miami!

08:45.856 --> 08:48.757
I could go for a Reuben myself
about now.

where can I find
your BFF Poison Ivy?

We need your help.

- Save it, honey.

could get hurt or killed.

15:18.482 --> 15:20.382
Kind of like all of these.

15:20.384 --> 15:21.416
No,

15:21.418 --> 15:22.752
not like those.

15:22.754 --> 15:24.619
It's a completely
different phylum

15:24.621 --> 15:26.555
from every other leaf in here.

15:26.557 --> 15:29.758
Great, you're the world's
greatest florist, too.

15:29.760 --> 15:31.227
Look closely.

15:31.229 --> 15:33.165
Have you ever seen
a leaf like this?

15:34.164 --> 15:35.732
Can't say that I have.

15:35.734 --> 15:38.267
That's because
it isn't from our planet.

15:38.269 --> 15:40.105
Not even from our dimension.

15:41.405 --> 15:43.171
Wait, you mean

15:43.173 --> 15:44.574
Jason Woodrue?

15:44.576 --> 15:46.376
That freak was here?

15:46.378 --> 15:48.143
This is bad.

15:48.145 --> 15:50.146
Your forensic people are bad.

15:50.148 --> 15:51.214
This...

15:51.216 --> 15:52.685
Is catastrophic.

15:54.418 --> 15:56.554
Nightwing, this is Batman.
Come in.

15:57.389 --> 15:58.554
Nightwing?

15:58.556 --> 15:59.756
Everything okay?

15:59.758 --> 16:02.157
He should've
reported in by now.

16:02.159 --> 16:03.725
You want me
to send out a search team?

16:03.727 --> 16:05.361
They're the best that...

16:05.363 --> 16:07.195
Well, they're pretty good.

16:07.197 --> 16:08.296
Like I said,

16:08.298 --> 16:10.299
eyes and ears everywhere.

16:10.301 --> 16:11.367
Besides...

16:11.369 --> 16:13.272
Nightwing can handle himself.

16:18.043 --> 16:19.742
- (GROANS)
- HARLEY: I know, I know, freaking stupid.

16:19.744 --> 16:21.411
Bringing him back to my place.

16:21.413 --> 16:22.712
But what was I supposed to do?

16:22.714 --> 16:24.347
I couldn't just let him go.

16:24.349 --> 16:26.348
He knows the secret location
of my hidey-hole.

16:26.350 --> 16:28.584
He'd blab to Batman for sure.

16:28.586 --> 16:31.387
Could've just killed him,
dumbass.

16:31.389 --> 16:33.321
HARLEY: Nah,
I'm not a criminal anymore.

16:33.323 --> 16:35.557
Plus, he's kind of
too cute to kill.

16:35.559 --> 16:36.592
And anyway,

16:36.594 --> 16:38.493
maybe I should help out.

16:38.495 --> 16:41.730
Sounds like Ivy could be in
some serious trouble...

16:41.732 --> 16:43.498
Don't bother yelling for help.

16:43.500 --> 16:45.435
This dump is condemned.

16:45.437 --> 16:48.206
Nobody in the whole building
but us, Nightwig.

16:49.073 --> 16:50.208
"Wing."

16:50.607 --> 16:52.340
Eh?

16:52.342 --> 16:54.643
It's Nightwing.

16:54.645 --> 16:56.079
Really?

16:56.081 --> 16:57.613
Guess I was thinking of
that goofy mullet

16:57.615 --> 16:59.482
you used to have.

16:59.484 --> 17:01.517
Yeesh. That was like
a whole decade of bad-hair days.

17:01.519 --> 17:03.319
Sticks and stones, lady.

17:03.321 --> 17:06.088
I've taken trash talk from
bigger criminals than you.

17:06.089 --> 17:07.390
"Criminals"?

17:07.392 --> 17:09.191
If you hadn't noticed,
I went straight.

17:09.193 --> 17:11.126
I'm a freaking waitress
already.

17:11.127 --> 17:13.765
Oh, golly, that's right,
I stand corrected.

17:16.733 --> 17:18.500
Check this out, smart guy.

17:18.502 --> 17:20.569
My pile of rejection letters.

17:20.570 --> 17:23.171
Evidently, the Mayo Clinic's
got some dumb policy

17:23.173 --> 17:26.142
of not hiring former
costume super-villains.

17:26.144 --> 17:29.112
Just like every other hospital
in the world.

17:29.114 --> 17:30.813
There are other jobs.

17:30.815 --> 17:33.449
Oh, sure.
I got a ton of offers.

17:33.451 --> 17:35.485
"We got a very
special role for you

17:35.487 --> 17:37.253
"in <i>Bad Girls After Dark."</i>

17:37.255 --> 17:38.653
And you got to love this one.

17:38.655 --> 17:41.224
"A tasteful pictorial
to be shot in Thailand

17:41.226 --> 17:42.661
"for legal reasons."

17:45.896 --> 17:47.395
You say I'm a criminal,

17:47.397 --> 17:49.198
they say I'm a whore.

17:49.200 --> 17:51.537
Well, I'm sick of other people
telling me what I am!

17:54.538 --> 17:55.540
Whatever.

17:56.508 --> 17:57.707
Got to say,

17:57.709 --> 17:59.808
you gave me
a heck of a workout.

17:59.810 --> 18:01.811
Got me all sweat-stinky.

18:01.813 --> 18:03.312
(SNIFFS)
Phew!

18:03.314 --> 18:05.547
Definitely could use a shower.

18:05.549 --> 18:07.717
I think better
when I don't reek.

18:07.719 --> 18:09.285
Still got to figure out
what to do

18:09.287 --> 18:10.489
about Nightwig over there.

18:11.321 --> 18:13.221
Hmm, what to wear,

18:13.223 --> 18:14.724
what to wear?

18:14.726 --> 18:15.892
Sucker-punch Harley.

18:15.894 --> 18:17.160
Arctic Harley.

18:17.162 --> 18:18.561
Street-luge Harley.

18:18.563 --> 18:19.862
Roller-babe Harley.

18:19.864 --> 18:21.430
Steampunk Harley.

18:21.432 --> 18:23.699
Goth-Lolita Harley.

18:23.701 --> 18:24.901
Hey, Nightwig,

18:24.903 --> 18:26.605
is it true you
used to be Robin?

18:27.438 --> 18:28.603
Hmph.

18:28.605 --> 18:29.939
Ain't that
a kick in the pants.

18:29.941 --> 18:31.876
Little boy-wonder
all grown up.

18:35.946 --> 18:37.479
Okay, now...

18:37.481 --> 18:39.614
Don't be getting
any funny ideas.

18:39.616 --> 18:40.618
Too late.

18:41.752 --> 18:43.585
It's funny.

18:43.587 --> 18:45.688
I always kind of thought you
and Batman didn't like girls.

18:45.690 --> 18:48.724
- Wait, what?
- You know, that book

18:48.726 --> 18:51.393
with the headlights
and the eyeball-gouging,

18:51.395 --> 18:53.362
I had to write a paper on it
back in college.

18:53.364 --> 18:54.596
Got a B-minus.

18:54.598 --> 18:55.864
Look, Harley, I...

18:55.866 --> 18:57.600
Pretty lonely
these last few months,

18:57.602 --> 18:59.201
if you know what I mean.

18:59.203 --> 19:01.370
You don't meet
a lot of likely prospects

19:01.372 --> 19:02.671
at Superbabes.

19:02.673 --> 19:04.407
I'm kind of choosy.

19:04.409 --> 19:06.241
I'm not saying
I don't want to,

19:06.243 --> 19:08.311
'cause that could be nice.

19:08.313 --> 19:11.247
All sorts of wrong, but nice.

19:11.249 --> 19:13.849
Right now, I just really
need to find Poison...

19:13.851 --> 19:14.917
(SHUSHES)

19:14.919 --> 19:16.285
Face it, sugar.

19:16.287 --> 19:17.719
I got something you want,

19:17.721 --> 19:20.823
and you sure as shooting
got something I want.

19:20.825 --> 19:22.490
So, be a good boy,

19:22.492 --> 19:24.392
and maybe, maybe...

19:24.394 --> 19:26.895
Mama will give you a cookie.

19:26.897 --> 19:29.431
The things I do for Gotham.

19:29.433 --> 19:31.470
I'm taking that as a yes.

19:34.471 --> 19:35.907
JASON: <i>It's disgusting.</i>

19:36.874 --> 19:38.442
It's an abomination.

19:40.478 --> 19:41.911
You think I like swapping spit

19:41.913 --> 19:43.879
with this geezer
every six hours?

19:43.881 --> 19:46.282
If you've got a better way
to keep him under our control,

19:46.284 --> 19:48.250
I am all ears.

19:48.252 --> 19:50.385
There's always torture.

19:50.387 --> 19:52.321
I don't torture.

19:52.323 --> 19:55.024
The seven-billion meat bags
who infest this world

19:55.026 --> 19:57.892
would probably consider
our plans for them torture.

19:57.894 --> 20:01.029
Or at least
cruel and inhumane.

20:01.031 --> 20:03.266
Our plans
are for the improvement

20:03.268 --> 20:04.767
of every organism on Earth.

definition of humane.

20:07.372 --> 20:08.770
(SCOFFS)
"Humane."

20:08.772 --> 20:11.673
What an ironic word
coined by a species

20:11.675 --> 20:13.276
completely devoid
of compassion

20:13.278 --> 20:14.943
for any other life forms,

or each other,
for that matter.

about climate change,

20:19.284 --> 20:21.816

changed anything?

Indeed, they have.

JASON: They've doubled
their output of greenhouse gases,

Meet you at the car.

(HUMMING)

Ivy's whereabouts, of course,

that's what you meant.

22:00.785 --> 22:02.054
No, not yet.

22:06.156 --> 22:08.359
Like you never made out
with a super-villain.

gonna work, dynamic duo.

22:17.167 --> 22:19.668
Nobody knows Ivy
like I know Ivy.

22:19.670 --> 22:21.003
Now, I can help you find her,

22:21.005 --> 22:22.805
but you're gonna let me
talk some sense into her

22:22.807 --> 22:24.140
before you come in, swinging.

22:24.142 --> 22:25.975
And then,
when this whole thing is over,

you're gonna put in
a good word

to agree to my terms,

22:52.836 --> 22:54.036
why should I help you?

there's only one conclusion.

They're going to
synthesize the formula

24:06.711 --> 24:08.844
convert it into

actually killing anyone.

not intentionally.

39:38.474 --> 39:40.974
Well, guessing
is hardly scientific

39:40.976 --> 39:43.445
but I suspect
it may have something

39:43.447 --> 39:45.579
to do with the fact
that we've been using

39:45.581 --> 39:47.148

01:06:20.041 --> 01:06:22.041
your actions

01:06:22.043 --> 01:06:24.711
have upset the balance

01:06:24.713 --> 01:06:26.649
in the green.

01:06:27.449 --> 01:06:28.715
I'm sorry.

01:06:28.717 --> 01:06:30.749
I'm so sorry.

01:06:30.751 --> 01:06:32.719
- Yes.
- Watch.

01:06:32.721 --> 01:06:35.358

Plant Guy into a stump or something.

No, no, no. No, don't go!

01:07:01.315 --> 01:07:04.684

01:07:04.686 --> 01:07:08.624

- Guys!
- BOTH: What?

I had this cellmate at Arkham
with the same problem.

"Sugar, we got a glass wall
