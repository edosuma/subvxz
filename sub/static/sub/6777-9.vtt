02:41.360 --> 02:43.749
I GOT STUNG BY
A BEE BEFORE.

02:43.860 --> 02:45.179

ALLERGIC REACTION.

03:05.080 --> 03:08.243
WHAT'S WRONG

03:08.350 --> 03:10.045
IS SHE GONNA BE OKAY ?

03:10.150 --> 03:11.879

03:45.050 --> 03:47.757
IT'S GREAT THAT,

03:47.860 --> 03:50.988
YOU KNOW,
YOU WANTED TO.

03:52.230 --> 03:54.653
OF COURSE
I WANTED TO.

03:54.760 --> 04:00.835
I MEAN, IT'S BEEN
A LONG TIME SINCE YOU...

04:02.100 --> 04:05.228
I MEAN, IT'S GREAT
THAT YOU WANTED TO.

04:10.350 --> 04:13.046
I HAVE A SURPRISE
FOR YOU.

04:13.150 --> 04:17.280
WHOA, OKAY.

04:17.390 --> 04:20.086
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO GIVE ME FIVE MINUTES THOUGH.

04:20.190 --> 04:21.487
10 MINUTES, TOPS.

04:21.590 --> 04:24.229
NO, IT'S A DIFFERENT
KIND OF SURPRISE.

04:24.330 --> 04:27.629
I SIGNED US UP FOR
A DANCE CLASS TONIGHT.

04:32.500 --> 04:35.537
A DANCE CLASS,
REALLY ?

04:35.640 --> 04:38.108
SALSA, TANGO, MERENGUE.

04:38.210 --> 04:39.837
OH, MERENGUE.

04:39.940 --> 04:44.377
WOW, MY MOM
USED TO DO THAT.

04:44.480 --> 04:46.778
SHE WON TROPHIES.

04:46.880 --> 04:49.019
MAYBE I'LL WIN ONE.

04:49.120 --> 04:51.816
I'M GONNA GO
MAKE SOME COFFEE.

04:51.920 --> 04:54.718
NO, NO,
I'LL DO IT !

04:57.060 --> 05:00.996
JULIO, AUGUSTO,
TIME TO GET UP !

05:01.100 --> 05:03.796
BY DIPPING THE SPONGE APPLICATOR
IN THE COLD WATER

05:03.900 --> 05:07.131
AND APPLYING IT TO BARBIE'S
LIPS, CHEEKS, AND EYELIDS

05:07.240 --> 05:09.538
YOU GET FLOURISH
OF GLAMOROUS COLOR.

05:09.640 --> 05:11.403
I'M TELLING TAYLOR
YOU TOOK IT OUT OF THE BOX.

05:11.510 --> 05:14.707
WHEN I WAS A KID,
I USED TO HAVE G-I JOES.

05:14.810 --> 05:18.439
THEY WERE ALWAYS GETTING
COURT-MARSHALED,

05:18.550 --> 05:21.542
WHICH, IN MY VERSION,
MEANT THEY HAD TO STAND NAKED

05:21.650 --> 05:22.947
IN FRONT OF ALL
THE OTHER DOLLS.

05:23.050 --> 05:26.588
50, IS THAT SOMETHING
YOU WANT TO ACT OUT ?

05:26.690 --> 05:30.126
I THINK WE'VE HAD ENOUGH
EXCITEMENT FOR A WHILE.

05:30.230 --> 05:32.994
THE THREE-WAYS ?

05:33.100 --> 05:34.158
WELL, YEAH.

05:34.260 --> 05:36.626
WHAT ABOUT THEM ?

05:36.730 --> 05:38.425
DON'T YOU THINK
THAT MAYBE

05:38.530 --> 05:40.191
THEY'RE NOT THE BEST
THING FOR US ?

05:40.300 --> 05:41.631
OH, REALLY ?

05:41.740 --> 05:43.367
SO, THAT WASN'T YOU
THE OTHER NIGHT

05:43.470 --> 05:46.030
THAT KEPT BEGGING US TO ARREST
AND INTERROGATE YOU ?

05:46.140 --> 05:47.277
I'M NOT SAYING
THEY'RE NOT FUN.

05:47.380 --> 05:49.678
SO, WHAT ARE
YOU SAYING ?

05:49.780 --> 05:51.907
I'M JUST STARTING
TO FEEL WEIRD ABOUT IT.

05:52.010 --> 05:54.615
OKAY, FINE.

05:54.720 --> 05:56.449
FINE ?

05:56.550 --> 05:58.086
YEAH, WHATEVER.

05:58.190 --> 05:59.418
KEITH, THAT IS
SO NOT FAIR.

05:59.520 --> 06:00.885
YOU ASK ME TO TELL YOU
HOW I FEEL ABOUT SOMETHING

06:00.990 --> 06:02.582
AND THEN WHEN I DO,
YOU JUST SHUT DOWN.

06:02.690 --> 06:04.658
I JUST DON'T FEEL LIKE
TALKING ABOUT IT RIGHT NOW.

06:04.760 --> 06:07.593
YOU'RE JUST ALL TENSE BECAUSE
WE'RE GOING TO SEE YOUR FATHER.

06:07.700 --> 06:09.895
WEE GOING TO
MY GREAT AUNT'S FUNERAL.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.592
WHERE YOUR FATHER
WILL BE

06:11.700 --> 06:13.634
AND WHOSE HOUSE
WE'LL BE STAYING AT.

06:13.740 --> 06:15.765
SO, I DON'T HAVE
A PROBLEM WITH HIM.

06:15.870 --> 06:17.531
OH, REALLY ?

06:17.640 --> 06:20.200
YEAH, I'VE BEEN WORKING ON
ALL THAT STUFF

06:20.310 --> 06:21.777
IN MY INDIVIDUAL THERAPY.

06:21.880 --> 06:23.575
REALLY ?

06:23.680 --> 06:25.443
THAT'S ALL
I TALK ABOUT.

06:25.550 --> 06:27.814
HOW COME YOU'VE NEVER
TOLD ME ANY OF THIS ?

06:27.920 --> 06:31.310
BECAUSE SOME THINGS ARE JUST
BETWEEN ME AND THE THERAPIST.

06:31.420 --> 06:34.116
I TELL YOU EVERYTHING.

06:34.220 --> 06:36.154
THAT'S BECAUSE
YOU NT MY APPROVAL.

06:36.260 --> 06:39.559
NO, IT'S BECAUSE
I LOVE YOU.

06:41.930 --> 06:43.989
AND THE OTHER GENTLEMAN,
HE'S YOUR BROTHER ?

06:44.100 --> 06:45.897
YES, DAVID.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.467
THAT'S WHO HELPED ME.

06:47.570 --> 06:50.300
HE LEFI' THIS MORNING
FOR A FRIEND'S FUNERAL.

06:50.410 --> 06:52.105
HE SOLD ME A CASKET.

06:52.210 --> 06:55.577
YES, THE CAMEO ROSE.

06:55.680 --> 06:57.102
IT'S NOT
GOOD ENOUGH.

06:57.210 --> 07:01.442
MR. FASTEAU, THE CAMEO ROSE
IS AN EXCELLENT CASKET.

07:01.550 --> 07:03.882
NO, I WANT SOMETHING
NICER FOR MARTHA.

07:03.990 --> 07:06.686
AND IT DOESN'T MATTER
HOW MUCH IT COSTS.

07:06.790 --> 07:09.623
I KNOW THAT WHEN
WE LOSE SOMEONE

07:09.730 --> 07:12.551
WE WANT TO SHOW
HOW MUCH WE LOVED HER,

07:12.660 --> 07:15.049
AND WE'RE AT A LOSS
AS TO HOW TO DO THAT,

07:15.160 --> 07:17.720
AND WE END UP SPENDING A LOT
OF MONEY ON SOMETHING THAT,

07:17.830 --> 07:19.832
IN THE END,
ISN'T REALLY NECESSARY.

07:19.940 --> 07:20.964
I DON'T CARE !

07:21.070 --> 07:22.628
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND,

07:22.740 --> 07:27.109
THIS IS THE LAST THING I'LL EVER
BE ABLE TO DO FOR MY WIFE ?

07:27.210 --> 07:32.000
THAT I WAS
A BAD HUSBAND.

07:32.110 --> 07:35.546
AFFAIRS AND
ALL THAT SHIT.

07:35.650 --> 07:41.008
THEN I GOT CANCER,
THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO DIE.

07:41.120 --> 07:43.384
BUT I GOT BETTER.

07:43.490 --> 07:45.651
I GOT A SECOND CHANCE.

07:45.760 --> 07:48.957
AND I REALIZED
HOW MUCH I LOVED HER.

07:49.060 --> 07:52.359
AND IT'S BEEN REALLY GOOD
THE LAST FEW YEARS.

07:52.470 --> 07:58.705
I JUST WANT
TO LOVE HER SOME MORE.

07:58.810 --> 08:01.870
I OWE HER.

08:01.980 --> 08:04.574
OH GOD...

08:04.680 --> 08:07.945
OH GOD, I LOVED HER,
I REALLY DID.

08:08.050 --> 08:10.018
OF COURSE YOU DID,
OF COURSE YOU DID.

08:10.120 --> 08:11.018
AND SHE KNEW THAT.

08:12.190 --> 08:13.919
SHE...

08:14.020 --> 08:18.127
WAS EVERYTHING TO ME.

08:23.330 --> 08:25.195
I AM SO SORRY.

08:37.180 --> 08:41.276
NATE, DO YOU REMEMBER
WHEN I USED TO MAKE

08:41.380 --> 08:42.984
THAT CASSEROLE
WITH THE...

08:43.090 --> 08:46.082
(crying )

08:58.470 --> 09:00.688
I USED TO DO THIS
FOR YOUR FATHER.

09:00.800 --> 09:03.837
HIS SHOULDERS WOULD GET
SO FULL OF KNOTS.

09:03.940 --> 09:08.309
IT'S SUCH
A STRESSFUL JOB.

09:20.290 --> 09:22.417
IT'S OKAY, BABY.

09:22.520 --> 09:24.681
IT'S OKAY.

09:41.910 --> 09:44.140
HEY, DO YOU WANT
THE FRONT PAGE ?

09:44.250 --> 09:47.344
NO, I CAN'T DEAL WITH
DEPRESSING NEWS RIGHT NOW.

09:50.650 --> 09:52.789
GOD, I DON'T REMEMBER
THIS BOOK BEING SO DARK.

09:52.890 --> 09:55.415
THESE KIDS IN THE ORPHANAGE
ARE BEING TORTURED.

09:55.520 --> 09:57.488
OH, THAT'S
THE BEST PART.

09:57.590 --> 09:59.353
WHERE THEY ALL HAVE
TO TAKE A BATH IN ICE WATER.

09:59.460 --> 10:01.553
WELL, YEAH.

10:01.660 --> 10:03.366
ISN'T THAT KIND OF
INAPPROPRIATE FOR KIDS ?

10:03.470 --> 10:05.028
COME ON,
WE'RE HUMAN BEINGS.

10:05.130 --> 10:08.258
WE ALL HAVE A SICK CRAVING
FOR THAT KIND OF DARK FANTASY.

10:08.370 --> 10:09.735
EVEN KIDS.

10:09.840 --> 10:11.603
I'VE HAD ENOUGH
DARK REALITY.

10:11.710 --> 10:13.075
I DON'T NEED
THE FANTASY.

10:15.010 --> 10:16.375
OH, JESUS.

10:16.480 --> 10:17.674
HMM ?

10:17.780 --> 10:21.318
NURSE CATERWAUL IS MAKING
NATHANIEL AND ISABEL

10:21.420 --> 10:23.012
CANE EACH OTHER.

10:23.120 --> 10:24.439
OH, READ THAT
PART OUT LOUD !

10:24.550 --> 10:25.983
YOU'RE SICK.

10:26.090 --> 10:28.888
IF BY THAT YOU MEAN SUFFERING
FROM BIPOLAR DISORDER

10:28.990 --> 10:31.424
WITH OCCASIONAL
PSYCHOTIC EPISODES,
THEN YES, I AM.

10:31.530 --> 10:33.896
HMM, HMM...

10:38.800 --> 10:41.291
THIS IS GOOD,
CLAIRE.

10:41.400 --> 10:42.662
IT'S LOVELY.

10:42.770 --> 10:46.206
THE BLURRINESS, THE WAY
THE LIGHT SEEMS TOO MUCH,

10:46.310 --> 10:49.199
AS IF THERE'S A SECRET FIRE
IN HER THAT'S SPILLING OUT

10:49.310 --> 10:51.540
FOR JUST A MOMENT AND YOU
WERE THERE TO CAPTURE IT.

10:51.650 --> 10:55.074
EXCELLENT WORK !

10:55.180 --> 10:56.738
THAN KS.

11:00.320 --> 11:02.584
IT ONLY TURNED OUT
THIS WAY

11:02.690 --> 11:04.385
BECAUSE I ACCIDENTALLY
DRAGGED THE SHUTTER.

11:04.490 --> 11:06.424
I WAS TOTALLY GONNA
RESHOOT IT.

11:06.530 --> 11:09.124
BUT HE'S RIGHT,
IT WORKS.

11:09.230 --> 11:11.528
IT'S REALLY GOOD.

11:11.630 --> 11:14.929
I WONDER HOW MUCH OF ART
REALLY IS ACCIDENTAL.

11:15.040 --> 11:16.905
I MEAN,
MAYBE LIKE MAGRITTE

11:17.010 --> 11:19.069
WHEN HE WAS PAINTING
HIS LISTENING ROOM

11:19.170 --> 11:21.434
WAS LIKE, "DAMN, I MADE
THE APPLE TOO BIG AGAIN."

11:21.540 --> 11:25.340
HELLO, I'M BEING
CLEVER OVER HERE ?

11:25.450 --> 11:27.213
SHIT !

11:27.320 --> 11:28.344
WHAT ?

11:28.450 --> 11:31.010
THE BLADE'S DULL.

11:31.120 --> 11:32.542
IT'S FUCKING UP
EVERYTHING.

11:32.650 --> 11:34.686
USE ANOTHER ONE.

11:34.790 --> 11:37.054
I'VE GOT 10 MATTES TO CUT,
I DON'T HAVE TIME.

11:37.160 --> 11:39.890
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU JUST
CHANGE THE BLADE, HERE ?

11:40.000 --> 11:40.989
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT
TO JUST CHANGE THE BLADE.

11:41.100 --> 11:42.761
BECAUSE IT'S
ALL JUST SHIT.

11:42.870 --> 11:44.667
I HATE IT,
I HATE EVERYTHING !

11:44.770 --> 11:46.397
I HATE THIS
PIECE OF SHIT !

11:46.500 --> 11:48.229
IT'S ALL
FUCKING SHIT !

11:48.340 --> 11:50.865
GOOD, A TANTRUM.

11:50.970 --> 11:53.438
THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY
TO LEARN, PEOPLE.

11:53.540 --> 11:56.373
RUSSELL,
YOU HATE YOUR WORK,

11:56.480 --> 11:58.038
BECAUSE YOU SECRETLY
HATE YOURSELF.

11:58.150 --> 12:00.539
WHICH MEANS THAT YOU'RE
STILL ONLY THINKING ABOUT

12:00.650 --> 12:01.776
AND LOOKING
AT YOURSELF.

12:01.880 --> 12:03.211
YEAH, WHATEVER.

12:03.320 --> 12:05.288
YEAH, WHATEVER,
BUT I UNDERSTAND THE IMPULSE.

12:05.390 --> 12:08.712
I ONCE FILLED THE TRUNK OF
MY CAR WITH ALL MY LATEST WORK

12:08.820 --> 12:10.685
AND THEN LIT
THE CAR ON FIRE

12:10.790 --> 12:13.554
AND LET IT ROLL DOWN
THE STREETS OF MONMARTE.

12:13.660 --> 12:15.855
WOW, THAT'S INTERESTING.

12:15.960 --> 12:19.066
BECAUSE EVERYTHING YOU DO IS
JUST SO FUCKING FASCINATING.

12:19.170 --> 12:21.991
OOH, SUCH VITRIOL
AND SUCH RAGE.

12:22.100 --> 12:24.568
AND WHY AREN'T YOU PUTTING
THIS INTO YOUR WORK ?

12:24.670 --> 12:27.036
WELL, YOU TELL ME
SOMETHING, OLIVIER.

12:27.140 --> 12:28.732
IF YOU KNOW SO MUCH
ABOUT ART AND LIFE,

12:28.840 --> 12:31.377
HOW COME YOU ENDED UP
BEING SUCH A PATHETIC POSER

12:31.480 --> 12:33.914
WHO NEEDS PEOPLE
HALF HIS AGE TO PROP HIM UP

12:34.020 --> 12:37.080
AND MAKE HIM FEEL GOOD
ABOUT HIMSELF ?

12:42.990 --> 12:46.187
HE COULD HAVE AT LEAST MADE
THE EFFORT TO SLAM THE DOOR.

12:46.290 --> 12:50.499
YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE ABSOLUTELY
NO COMMITMENT TODAY.

12:50.600 --> 12:54.366
GO BACK TO WORK !

13:01.510 --> 13:03.603
HEY, YOU OKAY ?

13:03.710 --> 13:06.474
YEAH, SORRY
ABOUT THAT.

13:06.580 --> 13:09.014
JUST A LITTLE
MELTDOWN.

13:09.120 --> 13:10.485
YEAH.

13:10.590 --> 13:12.410
I CAN STAY,
GO ANOTHER TIME.

13:12.520 --> 13:13.987
NO, NO, NO,
YOU'RE GOING.

13:14.090 --> 13:16.854
YOU NEED A BREAK,
YOU DESERVE A BREAK.

13:16.960 --> 13:18.484
YOU WANT
TO GET RID OF ME.

13:18.590 --> 13:19.727
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

13:19.830 --> 13:21.991
BUT IT'S FIVE HOURS
TO SANTA CRUZ

13:22.100 --> 13:23.567
AND YOU WANT TO GET TO YOUR
SISTER'S BEFORE DARK, RIGHT ?

13:23.670 --> 13:27.367
I FEEL LIKE SUCH A TERRIBLE
MOTHER FOR THINKING THIS,

13:27.470 --> 13:29.597
AND I KNOW AS SOON AS I WALK OUT
THE DOOR I'M GONNA MISS HER,

13:29.700 --> 13:32.828
BUT I'M KINDA LOOKING FORWARD
TO A COUPLE DAYS WITHOUT MAYA.

13:32.940 --> 13:37.877
THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE
A HANDFUL, AREN'T YOU ?

13:37.980 --> 13:40.312
SO, DID YOU MAKE
A LIST FOR ME ?

13:40.420 --> 13:41.717
A LIST FOR WHAT ?

13:41.820 --> 13:43.185
I DON'T KNOW,
USUALLY YOU MAKE LISTS.

13:43.290 --> 13:45.941
WHAT TIME I'M SUPPOSED
TO FEED MAYA,

13:46.050 --> 13:47.756
WHAT I CAN FEED HER,
WHAT I CAN'T FEED HER.

13:47.860 --> 13:49.714
YOU ALREADY KNOW
ALL THAT STUFF.

13:49.820 --> 13:51.583
YEAH, OKAY.

13:51.690 --> 13:53.829
JUST DON'T LET YOUR
MOTHER BATHE HER.

13:53.930 --> 13:55.158
IT'S LIKE SHE'S
SCRUBBING A POTATO.

13:55.260 --> 13:57.967
ALRIGHT,
I'LL BATHE HER.

13:58.530 --> 14:00.361
OKAY.

14:04.440 --> 14:06.135
I'M GONNA MISS YOU.

14:06.240 --> 14:09.209
MM-WAH !

14:09.310 --> 14:11.574
C'MON, WE'LL WALK YOU
TO THE CAR.

14:11.680 --> 14:13.272
NO, I DON'T WANT MAYA
TO SEE ME GO.

14:13.380 --> 14:14.608
I JUST DON'T.

14:14.720 --> 14:17.245
WELL.

14:17.350 --> 14:18.214
I LOVE YOU.

14:18.320 --> 14:18.979
GOODBYE THEN.

14:19.090 --> 14:21.809
BE GOOD TO DADDY,
RIGHT ?

14:21.920 --> 14:23.478
I LOVE YOU.

14:23.590 --> 14:25.558
BYE.

14:38.610 --> 14:40.407
ARTHUR,
ARE YOU BUSY ?

14:40.510 --> 14:42.239
I'M PUTTING AWAY
MY SOCKS.

14:42.340 --> 14:47.972
BUT I'VE BECOME CONFUSED AS
TO WHICH IS PAIRED WITH WHICH.

14:48.080 --> 14:51.481
THEY ALL LOOK
EXACTLY THE SAME.

14:51.590 --> 14:53.683
THUS, THE DILEMMA.

14:53.790 --> 14:56.315
ARTHUR, I REALLY
NEED TO TALK.

14:56.420 --> 14:58.957
OKAY.

15:03.730 --> 15:05.027
QUITE FRAN KLY,

15:05.130 --> 15:07.633
I'D LIKE TO KNOW
HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT

15:07.740 --> 15:09.367
THE COURSE OUR
RELATIONSHIP IS TAKING.

15:09.470 --> 15:10.698
AH.

15:10.810 --> 15:13.233
WE'VE BEEN ON QUITE
A SERENDIPITOUS JOURNEY,
HAVEN'T WE ?

15:13.340 --> 15:16.798
AND WHERE DO YOU
THINK IT'S HEADED ?

15:16.910 --> 15:18.639
SURELY SOMEPLACE DIVINE.

15:18.750 --> 15:21.116
DOES THAT MEAN...

15:21.220 --> 15:23.814
WELL, YOU KNOW,
INTIMACY ?

15:23.920 --> 15:26.616
I LOVE INTIMACY,
INTIMACY IS MY BEST FRIEND.

15:26.720 --> 15:29.689
ARTHUR,
I'M SO CONFUSED.

15:29.790 --> 15:32.657
DO YOU FIND ME
AT ALL ATTRACTIVE ?

15:32.760 --> 15:34.398
IF YOU FEEL I'M
TOO OLD FOR YOU--

15:34.500 --> 15:35.728
HEAVENS NO !

15:35.830 --> 15:38.594
YOU'RE THE PERFECT AGE
FOR ME, RUTH FISHER.

15:38.700 --> 15:39.792
IAM?

15:39.900 --> 15:41.333
ABSOLUTELY.

15:41.440 --> 15:43.567
SO HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT US
HAVING, YOU KNOW, SEX ?

15:43.670 --> 15:45.638
OH.

15:45.740 --> 15:48.106
OH MY.

15:48.210 --> 15:49.802
IT'S JUST THAT WE'VE BEEN SEEING
EACH OTHER FOR A WHILE AND...

15:49.910 --> 15:52.003
NOT EVEN A KISS.

15:52.110 --> 15:54.112
WELL, NOT SINCE--

15:54.220 --> 15:56.108
YES, I UNDERSTAND.

15:56.220 --> 16:02.079
WELL, I BELIEVE
THAT SEX CAN BE...

16:02.190 --> 16:06.388
WHEN TWO
BECOME ONE...

16:06.490 --> 16:11.268
IT NEEDN'T ALWAYS
BE PAINFUL...

16:11.370 --> 16:16.637
BUT IT IS INDEED
A VERY SLIPPERY SLOPE.

16:18.340 --> 16:19.967
ARTHUR...

16:20.080 --> 16:22.969
HAVE YOU
EVER HAD SEX ?

16:28.020 --> 16:30.614
I THINK I HAVE...

16:30.720 --> 16:33.086
IN A SENSE.

16:36.720 --> 16:39.188
ARE THERE ANY OTHER TOPICS
YOU'D LIKE TO DISCUSS ?

16:39.290 --> 16:41.258
NO.

16:41.360 --> 16:43.692
NO.

16:48.140 --> 16:50.461
UH, HELLO ?

16:50.570 --> 16:51.730
IT'S THIS WAY.

16:51.840 --> 16:53.068
YEAH, I KNOW THE WAY.

16:53.180 --> 16:54.238
SO, WHAT'S THE PROBLEM ?

16:54.340 --> 16:56.604
THE PROBLEM IS
WE'RE A COUPLE

16:56.710 --> 16:58.302
AND IT WOULD BE NICE
IF WE COULD WALK TOGETHER,

16:58.410 --> 17:00.048
LIKE EVERY OTHER COUPLE
IN AMERICA,

17:00.150 --> 17:02.914
ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING
I'M ABOUT TO WALK INTO A PLACE

17:03.020 --> 17:04.715
FILLED WITH YOUR
EVERY LIVING RELATIVE.

17:04.820 --> 17:07.755
SO, WALK FASTER THEN.

17:10.960 --> 17:12.985
OH PLEASE.

17:13.100 --> 17:14.249
NOW WHAT ?

17:14.360 --> 17:16.225
THAT'S JUST TACKY,
NO ONE WANTS TO SEE THAT.

17:16.330 --> 17:19.367
AND THIS GROUND
IS WET.

17:19.470 --> 17:21.438
THEY SHOULD HAVE PUT DOWN
MORE GREENS HERE.

17:21.540 --> 17:22.859
DAVID, IT'S FINE.

17:22.970 --> 17:24.858
NOT EVERYONE IS SUCH
A PERFECT IONIST.

17:24.970 --> 17:27.438
I'M NOT A PERFECTIONIST,
JUST PROFESSIONAL.

17:27.540 --> 17:31.544
NO ONE'S EVEN GOING
TO SEE THESE HERE.

17:33.050 --> 17:36.213
GOD, LET'S HOPE THESE GUYS
REMEMBER TO PUT YOUR GREAT-AUNT

17:36.320 --> 17:37.947
IN HER CASKET FACE-UP.

17:38.050 --> 17:39.039
LOOK, DAVID...

17:39.150 --> 17:40.686

17:45.230 --> 17:47.323

17:47.430 --> 17:48.749

17:48.860 --> 17:50.896

17:51.000 --> 17:52.968

17:54.640 --> 17:56.790
SO, YOU MADE IT DOWN.

17:56.900 --> 17:59.835
YEAH, OF COURSE.

17:59.940 --> 18:03.171
IT'S GOOD
TO SEE YOU, BABY.

18:05.850 --> 18:07.545

18:07.650 --> 18:08.446

18:10.050 --> 18:12.211
YEAH, I'D LIKE THAT.

18:19.660 --> 18:22.925
EXCUSE ME, ARE YOU
THE FUNERAL DIRECTOR ?

18:23.030 --> 18:25.089
UH...

18:25.200 --> 18:26.428

18:26.530 --> 18:28.566
I WAS WONDERING
IF I SHOULD BEGIN ?

18:30.340 --> 18:33.138
ACTUALLY, NOW WOULD BE
A PERFECT TIME.

18:33.240 --> 18:37.301
SOMETHING SOFT,
PERHAPS "AVE MARIA."

18:41.520 --> 18:43.283
PRAYER CARD ?

18:44.790 --> 18:47.782
HEY, JUST IN TIME
FOR LUNCH.

18:47.890 --> 18:50.654
I KNOW, I COULD SMELL CURRY
ALL THE WAY FROM LA CIENEGA.

18:50.760 --> 18:52.489
OH, I CUT UP
SOME PAPAYA.

18:52.590 --> 18:54.319

18:57.670 --> 18:59.729

18:59.830 --> 19:01.764
NO, I LIKE IT.

19:01.870 --> 19:03.804
I LIKE
TO SEE YOU HAPPY.

19:03.910 --> 19:05.104
I'M JUST GLAD
YOU'RE HERE.

19:05.210 --> 19:06.404
I TOLD YOU I WAS
COMING HOME FOR LUNCH.

19:06.510 --> 19:09.274
NO, I MEAN HERE
IN GENERAL, YOU KNOW ?

19:09.380 --> 19:10.574
STAYING WITH ME.

19:10.680 --> 19:11.942
YOU JUST WANT ME
TO PAY HALF THE RENT.

19:12.050 --> 19:13.449
YEAH, CAN I GET
THAT IN CASH ?

19:13.550 --> 19:14.539
FAT CHANCE.

19:14.650 --> 19:15.878
HOW WAS WORK ?

19:15.980 --> 19:17.914
TWO CANCELLATIONS
THIS MORNING.

19:18.020 --> 19:19.578
SORRY.

19:19.690 --> 19:20.918
NO, IT WAS GREAT.

19:21.020 --> 19:24.456
I GOT RAOUL
TO GIVE ME A MASSAGE.

19:24.560 --> 19:25.481
REALLY ?

19:25.590 --> 19:27.228
I WOULD'VE GIVEN YOU
A MASSAGE.

19:27.330 --> 19:30.197
YEAH, BUT YOU DIDN'T TRAIN
FOR THREE YEARS IN THAILAND.

19:30.300 --> 19:32.359
THIS GUY
IS AMAZING.

19:32.470 --> 19:33.767
YOU SHOULD SEE HIM.

19:33.870 --> 19:34.791
SCHEDULE ME.

19:34.900 --> 19:37.300
HEY, THIS LOOKS GOOD.

19:43.280 --> 19:45.840
OH, LOOK WHAT I GOT.

19:47.820 --> 19:49.879
OH WOW.

19:49.980 --> 19:51.538
I DIDN'T KNOW
THERE WAS A VIDEO.

19:51.650 --> 19:52.981
IT'S NEW, I THINK.

19:53.090 --> 19:56.184
"JOIN NATHANIEL AND ISABEL
ON THEIR FANTASTIC ADVENTURES."

19:56.290 --> 19:59.157
I'M NOT SURE I WOULD CALL
BEING REPEATEDLY TRAUMATIZED

19:59.260 --> 20:01.125
AN ADVENTURE,
EXACTLY.

20:01.230 --> 20:02.993
WE'VE GOT
TO WATCH IT TONIGHT.

20:03.100 --> 20:04.260
ALRIGHT.

20:09.700 --> 20:12.362
AH, I THOUGHT
I MIGHT FIND YOU HERE.

20:12.470 --> 20:14.108
YOU CERTAINLY DO
KEEP TO A SCHEDULE.

20:14.210 --> 20:16.474
HELLO, ARTHUR.

20:28.190 --> 20:29.817
HAVE YOU DONE
THE WHITES YET ?

20:29.920 --> 20:31.319
I'M DOING THEM
RIGHT NOW.

20:31.430 --> 20:35.150
I HAVE SOME KERCHIEFS
AND UNDERSHIRTS TO DO.

20:35.260 --> 20:38.969
SOME PEOPLE CALL THEM
"WIFE BEATERS,"

20:39.070 --> 20:41.197
WHICH I THINK
IS RATHER FUNNY.

20:41.300 --> 20:42.767
THERE'S NOTHING FUNNY
ABOUT BEATING YOUR WIFE.

20:42.870 --> 20:45.100
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

20:45.210 --> 20:48.873
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO SUGGEST OTHERWISE.

20:53.580 --> 20:54.911
PERHAPS...

20:55.020 --> 20:56.544
PERHAPS WHAT ?

20:56.650 --> 21:00.359
PERHAPS YOU'D PREFER IT IF
OUR LAUNDRY DIDN'T MIX ANYMORE.

21:00.460 --> 21:04.419
HONESTLY, ARTHUR, I DON'T CARE
WHAT OUR LAUNDRY DOES.

21:14.070 --> 21:14.968
HEY.

21:15.070 --> 21:16.139
HEY.

21:16.240 --> 21:18.731
WHAT ARE YOU
STILL DOING HERE ?

21:18.840 --> 21:21.434
I'M WAITING FOR YOU.

21:21.540 --> 21:23.599
I FIGURED YOU HAD TO COME BACK
AND GET YOUR STUFF.

21:23.710 --> 21:25.678
YEAH, I WAS JUST
WALKING AROUND CAMPUS,

21:25.780 --> 21:28.044
CURSING TO MYSELF AND BUMMING
CIGARETTES OFF PEOPLE.

21:28.150 --> 21:30.141
YOU DON'T SMOKE.

21:30.250 --> 21:32.218
I KNOW, AND I'M FEELING
KIND OF NAUSEOUS.

21:32.320 --> 21:35.016
WHAT'S GOING ON ?

21:35.120 --> 21:38.055
WHAT WAS ALL THAT
WITH OLIVIER ABOUT ?

21:38.160 --> 21:40.025
I DON'T KNOW.

21:40.130 --> 21:41.495
I THINK I'M JUST
GOING CRAZY.

21:41.600 --> 21:43.989
WHY ?

21:48.640 --> 21:51.165
CLAIRE, I NEED
TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

21:51.270 --> 21:55.377
THE WORDS EVERY WOMAN
LONGS TO HEAR.

21:58.510 --> 22:01.047
I'M SORRY,
I'M LISTENING.

22:07.090 --> 22:10.184
I FOOLED AROUND
WITH OLIVIER.

22:10.290 --> 22:13.123
WHAT ?

22:13.230 --> 22:15.221
WHEN ?!

22:15.330 --> 22:17.059
THAT DAY YOU
WENT TO AZUSA.

22:17.160 --> 22:18.889
YOU SAID
NOTHING HAPPENED.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.934
YOU LIED TO ME ?

22:21.040 --> 22:22.439
I'M SORRY.

22:22.540 --> 22:26.499
SO, WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU
"FOOLED AROUND" WITH HIM ?

22:26.610 --> 22:27.702
WHAT EXACTLY
DID YOU DO ?

22:27.810 --> 22:29.505
I DON'T THINK
YOU WANT TO KNOW.

22:29.610 --> 22:31.339
YEAH, I DO
WANT TO KNOW.

22:31.450 --> 22:34.544
CLAIRE,
WE HAD SEX.

22:37.350 --> 22:39.739
RUSSELL,
I TRUSTED YOU.

22:39.850 --> 22:42.216
YOU TOLD ME I DIDN'T
HAVE TO BE CAREFUL,

22:42.320 --> 22:44.220
YOU SAID THAT I COULD
FEEL SAFE WITH YOU !

22:44.330 --> 22:48.596
I KNOW,
AND I FEEL AWFUL.

22:48.700 --> 22:51.294
SO, WHAT,
YOU REALLY ARE GAY ?

22:51.400 --> 22:52.719
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

22:52.830 --> 22:55.264
I THINK I MIGHT
BE BI, BUT...

22:55.370 --> 22:56.860
I'M NOT SURE.

22:56.970 --> 22:59.268
I'M JUST REALLY,
I'M FUCKING CONFUSED.

22:59.370 --> 23:02.703
WELL, I'M SORRY
YOU'RE FUCKING CONFUSED.

23:02.810 --> 23:05.779
BUT YOU SURE AS HELL DIDN'T SEEM
CONFUSED EVERY TIME WE FUCKED

23:05.880 --> 23:08.644
OR EVERY TIME YOU
TOLD ME YOU LOVED ME,

23:08.750 --> 23:11.082
WHICH I WAS STUPID
ENOUGH TO BELIEVE.

23:11.190 --> 23:12.509
CLAIRE,
I DO LOVE YOU !

23:12.620 --> 23:13.848
OH, AND NOTHING
SAYS THAT BETTER

23:13.960 --> 23:15.359
THAN SUCKING
YOUR PROFESSOR'S DICK !

23:15.460 --> 23:17.087
LOOK, I ALREADY
FEEL LIKE AN ASSHOLE.

23:17.190 --> 23:19.954
YOU ARE AN ASSHOLE !

23:20.060 --> 23:21.254
THAN KS.

23:21.360 --> 23:22.896
SO WHAT ?

23:23.000 --> 23:24.922
WHAT GOES ON BETWEEN US
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH FOR YOU ?

23:25.030 --> 23:26.497
I DON'T KNOW.

23:26.600 --> 23:28.761
HAVE YOU EVER HAD SEX
WITH A MAN BEFORE ?

23:28.870 --> 23:31.703
NO, NEVER.

23:31.810 --> 23:33.368
BUT YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY
THOUGHT ABOUT IT.

23:33.480 --> 23:37.075
I WAS HIGH,
I'M FUCKING CONFUSED.

23:37.180 --> 23:40.513
I MEAN,

23:40.620 --> 23:42.941
WELL, THAN KS.

23:43.050 --> 23:46.087

23:54.260 --> 23:55.557
CLAIRE.

23:55.660 --> 23:56.820
DON'T EVEN CALL ME.

23:56.930 --> 23:58.067
CLAIRE.

23:58.170 --> 24:00.422

24:04.940 --> 24:06.237
HEY.

24:06.340 --> 24:07.068

24:51.790 --> 24:55.578
HEY, YOU WANT

25:17.680 --> 25:19.648
HI, SWEETIE !

25:19.750 --> 25:22.639

WATCHING A SQUIRREL RIGHT NOW.

25:22.750 --> 25:24.342
I'M LOOKING

25:49.380 --> 25:51.007
SHE'S LOOKING AT

26:01.890 --> 26:04.188

THEY WERE BURIED HERE.

26:04.290 --> 26:05.985
MY GRANDFATHER
WAS IN THE NAW.

26:06.090 --> 26:08.320
BROUGHT THE WHOLE
FAMILY OUT FROM CHICAGO

26:08.430 --> 26:09.727
AFTER WORLD WAR II.

26:09.830 --> 26:11.969
WE OWN ALL
THESE PLOTS.

26:12.070 --> 26:14.231
ARE YOU GOING
TO BE BURIED HERE ?

26:14.340 --> 26:15.762
I DON'T KNOW.

26:15.870 --> 26:18.338
I FEEL SO DISCONNECTED
FROM MY FAMILY.

26:18.440 --> 26:21.534
IT WOULD BE NICE
IF YOU AND I

26:21.640 --> 26:23.949
COULD BE BURIED
NEXT TO EACH OTHER.

26:26.750 --> 26:28.638
GRANDMA WANTS TO KNOW
IF YOU'RE READY TO GO ?

26:28.750 --> 26:31.810
YEAH, WE'LL FOLLOW YOU
BACK TO THE HOUSE.

26:33.960 --> 26:35.416

26:37.420 --> 26:38.580
UH-HUH.

26:38.690 --> 26:39.850
GRANDMA AND GRANDPA
TREAT YOU GOOD ?

26:39.960 --> 26:41.257
YEAH.

26:41.360 --> 26:43.248
WELL, GRANDMA THINKS
THAT GRANDPA SPOILS ME,

26:43.360 --> 26:44.691
BUT I LIKE IT.

26:44.800 --> 26:47.496
HE MADE ME A BUNK BED
BECAUSE I ASKED HIM TO,

26:47.600 --> 26:49.136
EVEN THOUGH
I'M JUST ONE PERSON.

26:49.240 --> 26:51.629
I GET TO SLEEP ON THE TOP
AND THE BOTTOM WHENEVER I WANT.

26:51.740 --> 26:53.901
SO GRANDPA
ISN'T MEAN TO YOU ?

26:54.010 --> 26:55.830
UH-UH, HOW COME YOU
ALWAYS ASK ME THAT ?

26:55.940 --> 26:57.339
DON'T YOU LIKE
GRANDPA ?

26:57.440 --> 26:59.772
OF COURSE I DO,
HE'S MY DAD.

26:59.880 --> 27:01.575
HE WAS SO HAPPY
YOU WERE COMING.

27:01.680 --> 27:02.942
HE WENT OUT
AND BOUGHT STEAKS.

27:03.050 --> 27:05.018
HE SAID IT WAS
YOUR FAVORITE.

27:08.860 --> 27:11.988
I THINK I SHOULD
TALK TO MY DAD TONIGHT.

27:12.090 --> 27:13.728
WOW.

27:13.830 --> 27:17.721

SO HANDSOME.

27:41.190 --> 27:42.259
THANK YOU.

27:42.360 --> 27:44.225
DANCING MAKES ME
FEEL SEXY.

27:44.330 --> 27:45.388
DO I LOOK SEXY, BABE ?

27:45.490 --> 27:47.651
OH, YOU LOOK AMAZING.

27:48.860 --> 27:52.694
NOW WE'RE GONNA DO
AN OUTSIDE TURN.

27:52.800 --> 27:56.167
OPEN BREAK,
BACK TO BASIC.

27:56.270 --> 27:58.465
OOH, I LIKE THAT.

27:58.570 --> 28:00.538

28:00.640 --> 28:01.629

28:03.080 --> 28:05.275
I'LL WAIT.

28:07.210 --> 28:09.314
ALRIGHT, EVERYBODY,
GIVE YOURSELVES
A LITTLE APPLAUSE.

28:09.420 --> 28:12.344

28:23.430 --> 28:24.328
ARE YOU THIRSTY ?

28:24.430 --> 28:25.795
UH, YEAH, A LITTLE.

28:33.340 --> 28:34.534
I SPILLED IT.

28:34.640 --> 28:35.937
THIS IS FUN, HUH ?

28:36.040 --> 28:37.234
OH MY GOD,

28:37.340 --> 28:39.444
I LOVE DANCING,

28:39.550 --> 28:40.915
WE SHOULD GO DANCING
EVERY NIGHT.

28:41.020 --> 28:43.511
THE KIDS MIGHT
MISS US AFTER A WHILE.

28:43.620 --> 28:45.247
OH YEAH, THE KIDS.

28:45.350 --> 28:47.716
YOU THINK THEY'RE OKAY,
SHOULD WE CALL THEM ?

28:47.820 --> 28:48.809
THEY'RE FINE,
SWEETIE.

28:48.920 --> 28:50.558
THEY CAN COME
DANCING TOO.

28:50.660 --> 28:51.729
WE'LL ALL GO DANCING.

28:51.830 --> 28:54.151
UH SHIT, THESE SHOES
ARE SO TIGHT.

28:54.260 --> 28:55.921
I SHOULDN'T
HAVE BOUGHT THEM.

28:56.030 --> 28:57.793
I SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT
SOMETHING COMFORTABLE,

28:57.900 --> 28:58.696
BUT THEY LOOK
SEXY, RIGHT ?

28:58.800 --> 29:00.119
VERY SEXY.

29:00.230 --> 29:03.358
( instructor )
OKAY, EVERYBODY,

29:11.780 --> 29:14.078
( thundering )

29:14.180 --> 29:16.648
This storm is exceedingly
fierce, Nathaniel.

29:16.750 --> 29:18.581
Hang on !

29:18.690 --> 29:20.248
THIS REALLY SUCKS.

29:20.350 --> 29:22.181
( crashing )

29:22.290 --> 29:23.757
I KNOW.

29:23.860 --> 29:25.748
IT LOOKS LIKE THOSE DRAWINGS
YOU SEE IN THE MALL

29:25.860 --> 29:27.896
BY SOMEONE'S
THIRD GRADE CLASS.

29:28.000 --> 29:28.955
I WAS REALLY LOOKING
FORWARD TO THIS.

29:29.060 --> 29:30.129
MAYBE IT'LL
GET BETTER.

29:30.230 --> 29:34.894
Isabel, you've saved me
so many times.

29:35.000 --> 29:39.209
Please, Isabel,
please don't die.

29:44.450 --> 29:45.701
UH!

29:45.810 --> 29:48.472
A TEAR ?

29:48.580 --> 29:51.583
HE SAVES ISABEL'S LIFE
WITH A FUCKING TEAR ? !

29:51.690 --> 29:54.056
HOW DID IT HAPPEN
IN THE BOOK ?

29:54.160 --> 29:56.685
MOUTH-TO-MOUTH
RESUSCITATION.

29:56.790 --> 29:58.087
WHICH MAKES SENSE.

29:58.190 --> 30:01.250
NOT SOME FUCKING
MAGIC TEAR.

30:04.530 --> 30:05.724
Curses.

30:05.830 --> 30:07.468
What ?
What is it ?

30:07.570 --> 30:09.197
Nurse Caterwaul.

30:09.300 --> 30:11.507
Children !

30:11.610 --> 30:13.635
( cackling )

30:13.740 --> 30:15.901
I CAN'T EVEN
WATCH THIS ANYMORE !

30:16.010 --> 30:18.444
BILLY, CHILL,
IT'S JUST A VIDEO.

30:18.550 --> 30:19.972
BUT THEY RUINED IT.

30:20.080 --> 30:23.049
THEY'RE LIKE
SO FUCKING SANITIZED,

30:23.150 --> 30:26.847
AND THERE'S NOT ANY REAL DANGER,
AND, I MEAN, COME ON.

30:26.950 --> 30:28.850
YOU CAN'T HAVE PEOPLE SAY
'PERSIMMONS AND PINEAPPLES'

30:28.960 --> 30:32.327
WITH AN AMERICAN ACCENT.

30:33.430 --> 30:35.591
WHAT A PIECE OF SHIT !

30:35.700 --> 30:38.521
HEY, IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

30:38.630 --> 30:41.599
YES, IT IS !

30:41.700 --> 30:43.292
IT WAS DAD,
YOU KNOW.

30:43.400 --> 30:44.867
DAD WHAT ?

30:44.970 --> 30:46.562
DAD WHO GAVE US
THE BOOK.

30:46.670 --> 30:47.659
REMEMBER ?

30:47.770 --> 30:48.907
KIND OF.

30:49.010 --> 30:51.706
HE GAVE IT TO US
FOR CHRISTMAS.

30:51.810 --> 30:55.348
AND NOW DAD'S DEAD.

30:57.780 --> 31:01.216
AND OUR WHOLE
CHILDHOOD SUCKED

31:01.320 --> 31:05.689
AND NATHANIEL AND ISABEL
WAS THE ONLY GOOD THING

31:05.790 --> 31:07.724
WE HAD AND THEY
FUCKING RUINED IT.

31:07.830 --> 31:09.593
THEY DIDN'T RUIN IT.

31:09.700 --> 31:13.363
WE STILL HAVE IT.

31:13.470 --> 31:16.064
'LL ALWAYS
HAVE IT.

31:18.010 --> 31:21.730
WE ARE SO
DAMAGED, BREN.

31:21.840 --> 31:24.900
WE CAN GO ABOUT
OUR LIVES AND PRETEND

31:25.010 --> 31:26.875
THAT EVERYTHING'S
GONNA BE OKAY,

31:26.980 --> 31:30.472
BUT WE NEVER WILL BE,
NEVER !

31:30.580 --> 31:32.013
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

31:32.120 --> 31:34.884
WE'RE GETTING BETTER,
BOTH OF US.

31:34.990 --> 31:36.651
YOU ARE.

31:36.760 --> 31:39.752
I'M NOT.

31:39.860 --> 31:41.657
COME ON,
YOU KNOW YOU ARE.

31:41.760 --> 31:45.298
I REALLY DON'T
FEEL LIKE I AM.

31:48.640 --> 31:51.939
AND THOSE ARE
JUST FEELINGS.

31:53.570 --> 31:55.071
THIS IS JUST
RIGHT NOW.

31:55.180 --> 32:02.370
THE MOVIE AND DAD DYING
AND ME MOVING IN.

32:02.480 --> 32:04.482
IT'S BROUGHT UP
A LOT OF STUFF FOR YOU.

32:04.590 --> 32:06.785
YOU'LL WORK THROUGH IT,
IT'LL GET BETTER.

32:06.890 --> 32:09.358
PROMISE ?

32:09.460 --> 32:11.087
YEAH, I PROMISE.

32:46.090 --> 32:48.126
IT WAS JUST A KISS.

32:48.230 --> 32:50.448
NO.

32:50.560 --> 32:51.959
NO, IT WASN'T.

32:52.070 --> 32:53.492
I WAS JUST

34:58.630 --> 35:01.155
I KNOW I'M CONFUSED.

35:01.260 --> 35:03.125
BUT THE ONE THING THAT
I AM COMPLETELY SURE OF

35:03.230 --> 35:04.697
IS THAT I LOVE YOU.

35:04.800 --> 35:07.064
AND I BELIEVE YOU.

35:07.170 --> 35:10.731
BUT I HAVE BEEN
THROUGH THIS BEFORE.

35:10.840 --> 35:14.537
I'M NOT SOME NURSE WHO'S HERE
TO TAKE CARE OF THE MISFITS.

35:14.640 --> 35:16.505
LOOK, I'M SORRY.

35:16.610 --> 35:18.168
BUT WHATEVER IT IS
YOU'RE GOING THROUGH

35:18.280 --> 35:19.406
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO FIGURE IT OUT ON YOUR OWN.

35:19.510 --> 35:21.068
WE SHOULD
BE TOGETHER.

35:21.180 --> 35:24.513
WE'RE BOTH CRAZY,
WE'RE BOTH FUCKED-UP ARTISTS.

35:24.620 --> 35:27.145
I MEAN, WE HAVE
TO BE TOGETHER.

35:27.250 --> 35:30.515
I DON'T THINK SO.

35:31.560 --> 35:33.118
I'M GONNA
CHANGE YOUR MIND.

35:33.230 --> 35:34.356
I SWEAR.

35:34.460 --> 35:35.893
PLEASE, JUST
LEAVE ME ALONE.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.218
CLAIRE, I WOULD CUT OUT MY HEART
AND GIVE IT TO YOU IN A BOX

35:38.330 --> 35:39.592
IF IT WOULD
CHANGE ANYTHING.

35:39.700 --> 35:41.099
WELL, IT WOULD BECAUSE
YOU'D BE DEAD, OKAY ?

35:41.200 --> 35:42.895
GOODBYE !

35:50.680 --> 35:53.740
(crying )

35:53.850 --> 35:55.169
CLAIRE ?

36:05.960 --> 36:08.451
( Lucille )
DID YOU GET
TAYLOR OFF TO BED ?

36:08.560 --> 36:10.824
YEAH, I CAN'T BELIEVE
HOW MUCH SHE'S GROWN UP.

36:10.930 --> 36:14.093
SHE POLITELY
INFORMED US

36:14.200 --> 36:15.690
THAT SHE'S TOO OLD
TO PLAY WITH BARBIES NOW.

36:15.800 --> 36:18.098
AND INSISTED THAT SHE
READ US A BEDTIME STORY.

36:18.210 --> 36:20.303
SHE'S SMART,
DOING WELL IN SCHOOL.

36:20.410 --> 36:21.968
( Keith )
GOOD.

36:22.080 --> 36:25.106
SHE MISSES HER MOMMA, BUT WE
DEAL WITH THAT THE BEST WE CAN.

36:25.210 --> 36:26.905
SHE SEEMS HAPPY.

36:27.010 --> 36:28.272
I'M JUST GLAD
THIS IS WORKING OUT.

36:28.380 --> 36:30.678
OF COURSE
IT'S WORKING OUT.

36:30.780 --> 36:32.782
LUCILLE, CAN I HELP YOU
IN THE KITCHEN ?

36:32.890 --> 36:35.654
SURE, DAVID,
THAN KS.

36:40.830 --> 36:45.199
DAD, I NEED TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING.

36:49.070 --> 36:51.436
LOOK, I UM...

36:51.540 --> 36:55.499
I KNOW THINGS
HAVEN'T ALWAYS BEEN

36:55.610 --> 36:57.407
SO SMOOTH BETWEEN
YOU AND ME.

36:57.510 --> 36:59.603
AND I'VE BEEN WORKING ON SOME
THINGS ABOUT MYSELF IN THERAPY.

36:59.710 --> 37:03.840
AND I'VE COME TO REALIZE THAT
I WAS PRETTY MUCH TRAUMATIZED

37:03.950 --> 37:06.214
BY THE WAY YOU PUNISHED ME
AND KARLA WHEN WE WERE KIDS.

37:06.320 --> 37:08.754
THAT WAS ABUSIVE.

37:08.860 --> 37:11.727
THAT WAS ABUSE.

37:11.830 --> 37:12.956
ABUSE.

37:13.060 --> 37:14.596
I KNOW YOU DID
THE BEST YOU COULD,

37:14.700 --> 37:16.190
AND YOU WERE PROBABLY JUST
REPEATING WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU,

37:16.300 --> 37:17.449
BUT IT DID
A NUMBER ON ME,

37:17.560 --> 37:19.027
AND I KNOW IT DID ONE
ON KARLA--

37:19.130 --> 37:20.563
OH, SO NOW I'M TO BLAME FOR YOUR
SISTER'S PROBLEMS WITH DRUGS ?

37:20.670 --> 37:22.160
NO, I'M NOT
BLAMING ANYONE.

37:22.270 --> 37:23.794
I JUST WANT
TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE TRUTH

37:23.900 --> 37:25.367
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
SO I CAN FORGIVE YOU.

37:25.470 --> 37:28.439
YOU WANT
TO FORGIVE ME ?

37:28.540 --> 37:32.306
YEAH, SO WE CAN HAVE
A REAL RELATIONSHIP

37:32.410 --> 37:33.604
WHILE WE STILL HAVE TIME.

37:33.710 --> 37:36.372
WHAT THE FUCK
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ?

37:36.480 --> 37:38.710
I DISCIPLINED MY CHILDREN
WHEN THEY DESERVED IT.

37:38.820 --> 37:41.550
I GAVE YOU A HOME,
I GAVE YOU FOOD TO EAT,

37:41.660 --> 37:43.287
I TAUGHT YOU
HOW TO BE A MAN.

37:43.390 --> 37:44.687
AND YOU WANT
TO FORGIVE ME ?

37:44.790 --> 37:46.826
YOU BETTER GET ON YOUR KNEES
AND THANK ME,

37:46.930 --> 37:49.194
AND MAYBE I'LL FORGIVE YOU
FOR BEING A GODDAMN FAGGOT.

37:49.300 --> 37:50.449
I'M SORRY.

37:50.560 --> 37:51.697
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT--

37:51.800 --> 37:53.825
I SAID I WANT
TO HEAR YOU THANK ME !

37:58.200 --> 38:00.430
WHO YOU THINK
YOU PUSHING, BOY ?

38:00.540 --> 38:01.973
BOTH OF YOU,
STOP IT !

38:02.080 --> 38:04.173
MR. CHARLES, YOUR SON WAS ONLY
TRYING TO REACH OUT TO YOU.

38:04.280 --> 38:05.406
AND WHO THE FUCK
ARE YOU AGAIN ?

38:05.510 --> 38:07.569
I'M THE MAN YOUR SON
IS IN LOVE WITH.

38:07.680 --> 38:09.875
YEAH, WELL IT MAKES ME
SICK TO MY STOMACH.

38:09.980 --> 38:11.880
HOW THE FUCK CAN YOU
ACT SO GODDAMN SUPERIOR

38:11.990 --> 38:13.981
WHEN EVERYONE HERE KNOWS
THAT YOU BEAT YOUR KIDS,

38:14.090 --> 38:15.648
YOU CHEATED ON
YOUR WIFE--

38:15.760 --> 38:17.614
I DID NO SUCH THING,
HOW DARE YOU ?!

38:17.720 --> 38:19.756
KEITH, YOU NEED
TO TELL HIM !

38:19.860 --> 38:21.725
DAVID, THIS ISN'T
THE PLACE FOR YOU TO SAY
ANYTHING ABOUT THIS STUFF.

38:21.830 --> 38:23.957
IT'S NOT MY PLACE ?

38:24.060 --> 38:26.722
NO, THIS IS MY FAMILY,
STAY THE FUCK OUT OF IT !

38:29.340 --> 38:31.262
THEN I CAN'T BE HERE.

38:31.370 --> 38:34.533
DAVID--

38:36.340 --> 38:39.673
YOU SHOULD'VE KNOCKED HIS TEETH
OUT FOR WHAT HE SAID TO ME.

38:39.780 --> 38:43.375
YOU'RE PATHETIC.

38:44.350 --> 38:47.547
( X's "Los Angeles" playing )

38:49.320 --> 38:51.379
I KNOW, THIS IS
A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT

38:51.490 --> 38:52.718
THAN THE MUSIC
MOMMY PLAYS, ISN'T IT ?

38:52.830 --> 38:54.752
BUT I JUST DON'T THINK
I CAN STAND TO HEAR

38:54.860 --> 38:56.191
THE WIGGLES SING
"DANCE THE OOBY DOOBY"

38:56.300 --> 38:57.699
ONE MORE TIME WITHOUT
TEARING MY HEAD OFF.

38:57.800 --> 38:58.994
( buzzer )

38:59.100 --> 39:00.624
IT'S OPEN,
COME ON UP !

39:00.730 --> 39:04.439
HEY, IT'S
THE PIZZA MAN !

39:04.540 --> 39:07.964
ARE YOU READY FOR YOUR FIRST
TASTE OF PEPPERONI, HUH ?

39:10.140 --> 39:11.505
BRENDA, HEY.

39:11.610 --> 39:14.579
I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T
KNOW WHERE ELSE TO GO.

39:14.680 --> 39:16.978
I DIDN'T HAVE YOUR
NUMBER UP HERE.

39:17.080 --> 39:18.047
NO, IT'S FINE,
COME ON IN.

39:18.150 --> 39:19.185
ARE YOU SURE ?

39:19.290 --> 39:20.917
I'M NOT INTERRUPTING
ANYTHING ?

39:21.020 --> 39:23.614
NO, LISA'S GONE.

39:23.720 --> 39:27.679
I'M JUST INTRODUCING MAYA
TO SOME MUSIC THAT DOESN'T SUCK.

39:30.030 --> 39:31.019
WHAT'S WRONG ?

39:31.130 --> 39:33.098
BILLY.

39:33.200 --> 39:37.637
LET ME PUT MAYA DOWN
IN HER PLAYPEN.

39:39.070 --> 39:41.573
EVER SINCE
YOUR FATHER DIED

39:41.680 --> 39:43.432
I'VE JUST FLITTED
FROM MAN TO MAN.

39:43.540 --> 39:45.144
I AM SO EMBARRASSED.

39:45.250 --> 39:47.138
WELL...

39:47.250 --> 39:50.139
I MEAN, LOOK.

39:50.250 --> 39:53.845
YOU GOT MARRIED
WHEN YOU WERE 19.

39:53.950 --> 39:55.383
THAT'S HOW OLD I AM.

39:55.490 --> 39:58.186
LOOK, YOU NEVER EVEN GOT
TO HAVE YOUR SEXUAL 20's,

39:58.290 --> 40:00.656
SO, WHY SHOULDN'T YOU
DO IT NOW ?

40:00.760 --> 40:02.694
I MEAN, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO WORRY ABOUT US ANYMORE.

40:02.800 --> 40:06.292
NO.

40:06.400 --> 40:10.029
DID YOU KNOW I GOT
PREGNANT THE FIRST TIME
I'D EVER HAD SEX ?

40:10.140 --> 40:12.802
OH MY GOD.

40:12.910 --> 40:15.276
WITH DAD ?

40:15.380 --> 40:17.007
OF COURSE.

40:17.110 --> 40:19.442
OKAY, I THOUGHT YOU WERE
JUST GONNA TO TELL ME

40:19.550 --> 40:21.916
I HAD SOME LIKE LOVE-CHILD
HALF BROTHER SOMEWHERE,

40:22.020 --> 40:24.341
WHICH I REALLY DON'T
THINK I COULD HANDLE NOW.

40:24.450 --> 40:26.042
NO, IT WAS NATE.

40:26.150 --> 40:28.755
NATHANIEL AND I HAD
TO GET MARRIED RIGHT AWAY.

40:28.860 --> 40:32.250
BOTH OUR FAMILIES
WERE MORTIFIED.

40:32.360 --> 40:37.753
IT CHANGED
MY LIFE FOREVER.

40:38.230 --> 40:40.460
WOW.

40:41.470 --> 40:43.893
DO YOU EVER WONDER
HOW YOUR LIFE

40:44.000 --> 40:46.264
WOULD BE DIFFERENT
IF THAT HADN'T HAPPENED ?

40:46.370 --> 40:47.962
I USED TO.

40:48.070 --> 40:50.004
NOT ANYMORE.

40:53.980 --> 40:55.811
WERE YOU AND DAD
IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER ?

40:55.920 --> 40:57.069
OH, YES !

40:57.180 --> 40:59.444
VERY MUCH SO,
AT FIRST.

40:59.550 --> 41:01.984
DESPITE HOW
WE GREW APART,

41:02.090 --> 41:05.981
YOUR FATHER WAS
THE GREAT LOVE OF MY LIFE.

41:08.090 --> 41:10.229
AT LEAST YOU HAD THAT.

41:10.330 --> 41:12.161
I'M BEGINNING
TO THINK I NEVER WILL.

41:12.270 --> 41:14.534
YOU WILL,
EVERYONE DOES.

41:14.640 --> 41:18.633
BUT CHANCES ARE, IT WON'T BE
ANYTHING LIKE YOU EXPECT.

41:20.610 --> 41:21.907
I MISS DAD,
YOU KNOW ?

41:22.010 --> 41:26.071
I FEEL LIKE...

41:26.180 --> 41:29.172
I HATE HOW I JUST LIKE TOOK HIM
FOR GRANTED MY WHOLE LIFE,

41:29.280 --> 41:30.747
AND NOW HE'S GONE,

41:30.850 --> 41:32.784
AND IT'S TOO LATE FOR ME
TO EVER REALLY KNOW HIM,

41:32.890 --> 41:35.051
YOU KNOW,
LIKE AS AN ADULT.

41:35.160 --> 41:37.481
I MISS HIM TOO.

41:37.590 --> 41:40.957
THERE WILL NEVER BE
ANOTHER MAN

41:41.060 --> 41:42.857
WHO WILL LOVE ME WHEN
I'M YOUNG AND PRETTY,

41:42.960 --> 41:45.326
AND THEN ALWAYS HAVE
THAT PICTURE OF ME

41:45.430 --> 41:46.897
SOMEWHERE
IN HIS HEART.

41:47.000 --> 41:49.594
OH, MOM.

41:49.700 --> 41:51.338
YOU'RE SO PRETTY.

41:51.440 --> 41:54.204
GOD, YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.

41:54.310 --> 41:57.529
WHY DO YOU THINK ALL THESE MEN
ARE ALWAYS HITTING ON YOU ?

41:57.640 --> 41:59.471
YOU'RE SO SWEET.

41:59.580 --> 42:03.016
BUT LOOK AT THE MEN !

42:03.120 --> 42:07.113
I'M SITTING HERE
CRYING OVER ARTHUR.

42:07.220 --> 42:08.517
ARTHUR !

42:08.620 --> 42:11.748
WHAT SHOULD
I DO ABOUT HIM ?

42:11.860 --> 42:14.624
RUN.

42:17.300 --> 42:19.461
I FEEL SORRY
FOR HIM THOUGH.

42:19.570 --> 42:21.492
HE'S SO NAIVE.

42:21.600 --> 42:24.660
I FEEL SORRY
FOR RUSSELL TOO.

42:24.770 --> 42:28.365
I MEAN,
I HATE HIM,

42:28.470 --> 42:34.045
BUT I FEEL
SORRY FOR HIM.

42:34.150 --> 42:37.074
MOM, WHY IS IT I ATTRACT EVERY
SCREWED-UP GUY IN THE STATE ?

42:37.180 --> 42:42.652
BECAUSE THEY CAN SEE
WHAT A KIND SOUL YOU HAVE,

42:42.760 --> 42:46.127
THAT YOU'RE CARING
AND SENSITIVE.

42:46.230 --> 42:50.018
IT'S THE TRUTH, CLAIRE,
YOU'RE AN ANGEL.

42:50.130 --> 42:54.328
BUT THE REAL QUESTION IS
WHY DO YOU LIKE THEM ?

42:54.430 --> 42:58.708
IT'S LIKE I'LL FALL FOR ANY GUY
WHO SHOWS ANY INTEREST IN ME.

42:58.810 --> 43:02.803
I GUESS WE ALL WANT
TO BE LOVED.

43:02.910 --> 43:05.743
IT'S HARD
TO SAY NO TO THAT,

43:05.850 --> 43:09.047
NO MATTER WHO
IT'S COMING FROM.

43:11.050 --> 43:12.984
I MEAN, RIGHT FROM
THE VERY BEGINNING

43:13.090 --> 43:14.853
THERE WAS THIS VOICE
INSIDE MY HEAD SAYING,

43:14.960 --> 43:16.359
"DON'T MOVE IN
WITH BILLY.

43:16.460 --> 43:18.109
DON'T MOVE IN
WITH BILLY."

43:18.220 --> 43:20.381
WHAT DO I DO ?

43:20.490 --> 43:22.151
I MOVE IN WITH BILLY.

43:22.260 --> 43:23.852
I'M SO SELF-DESTRUCT IVE.

43:23.960 --> 43:27.020
MAYBE YOU WANTED
TO BELIEVE THE WORLD

43:27.130 --> 43:29.132
IS A BETTER PLACE
THAN IT REALLY IS.

43:29.240 --> 43:31.492
SO, I'M AN IDIOT.

43:31.600 --> 43:36.173
NO, JUST A VERY
POSITIVE PERSON.

43:36.280 --> 43:38.032
THAT DOESN'T
SOUND LIKE ME.

43:38.140 --> 43:40.802
IT'S SCARY TO HOPE THINGS
ARE GONNA TURN OUT GOOD,

43:40.910 --> 43:42.377
BECAUSE THEN YOU'RE
TAKING THE RISK

43:42.480 --> 43:43.845
OF BEING DISAPPOINTED
IF THEY DON'T.

43:43.950 --> 43:48.444
WOW, YOU'VE REALLY
THOUGHT ABOUT THIS.

43:48.550 --> 43:51.656
NO, I'M JUST
TALKING OUT MY ASS.

43:51.760 --> 43:54.627
I HAVE NO CLUE
WHATSOEVER.

43:56.600 --> 43:59.421
LOOK, ALL I KNOW IS
YOU'RE A GOOD PERSON

43:59.530 --> 44:02.237
WHO DESERVES
TO BE HAPPY.

44:02.340 --> 44:06.629
SO ARE YOU,
YOU KNOW ?

44:13.550 --> 44:14.812
WELL, I SHOULD GO.

44:14.920 --> 44:17.138
ALRIGHT, YOU'RE SURE
YOU'RE GOING TO BE OKAY ?

44:17.250 --> 44:18.319
YEAH.

44:18.420 --> 44:19.614
AND YOU GOT
MY NUMBER, RIGHT ?

44:19.720 --> 44:20.687
UH-HUH.

44:23.260 --> 44:24.727
THANK YOU.

44:24.830 --> 44:28.049
HEY, WHAT ARE
FRIENDS FOR ?

44:31.530 --> 44:33.066
THANK YOU.

44:33.170 --> 44:35.229
YOU'RE WELCOME.

44:59.530 --> 45:02.397
THIS ISN'T RIGHT.

45:02.500 --> 45:03.455
I'M GONNA GO--

45:06.930 --> 45:09.137
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I JUST DID THAT.

45:09.240 --> 45:10.593
YOU'RE MARRIED.

45:10.700 --> 45:12.702
YES, I'M MARRIED.

45:12.810 --> 45:14.505
I'M SO SORRY,
I'M WORSE THAN BILLY.

45:14.610 --> 45:16.407
NO, NO, NO,
I WAS RIGHT THERE TOO.

45:16.510 --> 45:18.375
I'M SO FUCKING
PREDICT ABLE.

45:18.480 --> 45:20.368
I'M GONNA LEAVE NOW.

45:20.480 --> 45:21.606
YOU HAVE
A PLACE TO GO ?

45:21.710 --> 45:24.918
YEAH, I'LL BE FINE.

45:44.370 --> 45:45.530
HEY, SAILOR.

45:45.640 --> 45:50.339
PATRICK, I CAN'T
BELIEVE YOU'RE HERE.

45:50.440 --> 45:51.407
I GOT YOUR MESSAGE.

45:51.510 --> 45:53.148
YOU SOUNDED
MISERABLE.

45:53.250 --> 45:55.172
WELL, YEAH.

45:55.280 --> 45:56.838
I'LL DRIVE YOU HOME.

45:56.950 --> 45:59.839
YOU CAN TELL ME
ALL ABOUT IT.

46:03.120 --> 46:05.429
I STILL CAN'T
BELIEVE YOU'RE HERE.

46:05.530 --> 46:09.091
I CAN'T SLEEP
AT NIGHT ANYWAY.

46:12.500 --> 46:14.388
HEY, BARB,
IT'S NATE.

46:14.500 --> 46:15.569
IS LISA THERE ?

46:15.670 --> 46:17.262
OH.

46:17.370 --> 46:20.032
UH, I DON'T KNOW.
