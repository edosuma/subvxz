WEBVTT

00:04.796 --> 00:06.299
I don't understand!

00:06.365 --> 00:08.200
It was supposed to be
a routine telemetry implant.

00:08.267 --> 00:11.170
Standard tag and monitor, then
weighed, sexed and measured!

00:11.237 --> 00:13.772
Apparently, behavioral
patterns are highly erratic.

00:13.838 --> 00:15.473
Banging into the side of
the tank, tearing off pieces

00:15.540 --> 00:19.111
of her own skin, could be an
allergic reaction to the tag.

00:19.178 --> 00:20.745
Bacterial infection maybe?

00:20.812 --> 00:22.447
We might have to run
bloodwork on glucose, cortisol

00:22.514 --> 00:25.217
and lactate to gauge levels
on medium term consequences.

00:25.284 --> 00:27.053
She's going into convulsions!

00:27.119 --> 00:31.057
I have pulses and electrical
activity in the systemic heart!

00:34.360 --> 00:35.860
What do you need?

00:35.928 --> 00:39.131
We have to initiate
cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

00:39.198 --> 00:41.334
100 micrograms epinephrine!

00:41.400 --> 00:42.767
Anything else?

00:42.834 --> 00:44.437
Prep one dose lidocaine,

00:44.502 --> 00:47.572
one magnesium chloride in case
we have to remove the tag!

00:47.639 --> 00:49.507
The IE injectors are
in the supply!

00:49.574 --> 00:51.010
There should be a
whole new batch in there!

00:51.077 --> 00:53.112
The stuff from Eden Zoo
had to be destroyed.

00:55.214 --> 00:57.482
100 micrograms now!

01:06.425 --> 01:07.625
Here!

01:14.367 --> 01:15.734
Five!

01:17.569 --> 01:19.205
10 seconds!

01:21.706 --> 01:23.242
15! No response!

01:25.111 --> 01:27.279
20 seconds!
Still no response!

01:27.346 --> 01:30.249
I think we lost her!

01:30.316 --> 01:32.684
Counting down to
one-half minute!

01:45.331 --> 01:46.765
Ah!

01:54.073 --> 01:55.607
No!

03:09.014 --> 03:11.183
Welcome to a world of wonder.

03:11.250 --> 03:14.886
Nearly 72% of our planet
is covered in water,

03:14.954 --> 03:18.090
home to one million
different species of life.

03:18.157 --> 03:21.093
Even now, humankind
continues to unlock

03:21.160 --> 03:25.864
the extraordinary secrets
that lurk beneath the surface.

03:25.931 --> 03:28.700
There is a place where
these mysteries of the deep

03:28.766 --> 03:31.170
are explored and celebrated.

03:31.237 --> 03:35.407
That place is the Shining Sea
Aquarium.

03:35.474 --> 03:39.145
We strive to educate,
protect, and inspire

03:39.211 --> 03:42.914
through our many innovative
exhibits and learning programs

03:42.982 --> 03:44.682
that bring you face to face

03:44.749 --> 03:47.620
with our planet's most
exotic creatures.

03:47.886 --> 03:51.123
So come, step into
that world of wonder.

03:51.190 --> 03:54.893
Immerse yourself in imagination
and observe our oceans

03:54.960 --> 03:59.265
like never before...
at Shining Sea Aquarium.

04:25.324 --> 04:27.859
The vets did an ultrasound
on our dolphin, Hannah,

04:27.927 --> 04:30.429
last week and nothing
came back abnormal.

04:30.496 --> 04:33.332
But on closer examination,
I have found

04:33.399 --> 04:35.900
lesions on the hearts
and the tissues

04:35.968 --> 04:37.735
in the surrounding areas
that are consistent

04:37.802 --> 04:39.771
with heart failure.

04:39.837 --> 04:41.706
I'm not really
gonna be satisfied

04:41.773 --> 04:43.509
until I do some more tests.

04:43.576 --> 04:46.078
But I have never
seen a dolphin's condition

04:46.145 --> 04:50.115
deteriorate so quickly
unless it was something viral.

04:54.687 --> 04:55.887
Ugh.

04:59.625 --> 05:01.260
Oh! Um...

05:01.327 --> 05:02.628
Am I too early?

05:02.695 --> 05:04.063
I can come back.

05:04.129 --> 05:06.365
No. Hi, Joe.
You're... You're fine.

05:06.432 --> 05:09.001
I think I'm all done here.
I've got everything I need.

05:09.068 --> 05:12.504
What do you want me
to do about disposal?

05:12.571 --> 05:14.006
Oh.

05:14.073 --> 05:15.608
We have to recycle her

05:15.674 --> 05:19.545
per the new company policy
from the people up above.

05:19.612 --> 05:21.046
Mm.

05:21.113 --> 05:23.382
Not a fan of that choice myself.

05:23.449 --> 05:25.351
Me neither.

05:25.417 --> 05:26.485
Hannah deserves better.

05:32.924 --> 05:36.828
Hey, Joe, would you hold off
for a little while

05:36.894 --> 05:38.497
rolling her out?

05:38.564 --> 05:41.600
We've got a VIP experience
at the shark exhibit

05:41.667 --> 05:45.638
and I would rather the guest
see the sharks eat mackerel

05:45.704 --> 05:47.139
instead of Hannah.

05:47.206 --> 05:49.375
- Sure thing.
- Thanks, Joe.

05:53.979 --> 05:55.948
It's too bad.

06:32.884 --> 06:34.987
Oh...

06:38.856 --> 06:40.759
Hey, Ellen.
I've got a morning feed.

06:40.825 --> 06:42.127
What's up?

06:42.194 --> 06:44.196
Daniel, I'm checking
to make sure that

06:44.263 --> 06:45.764
all of those medications
that you received

06:45.830 --> 06:48.133
from our facility
were destroyed.

06:48.200 --> 06:49.501
Yeah, I handled it myself.

06:49.568 --> 06:51.136
Our logistics firm moved
all the doses

06:51.203 --> 06:52.705
out of the veterinary wing.

06:52.771 --> 06:54.306
Moved?

06:54.373 --> 06:55.708
You need to make sure
that they were destroyed!

06:55.774 --> 06:57.242
Do you hear me?

06:57.309 --> 07:00.079
No worries, Ellen.
I am sure that it is handled.

07:00.145 --> 07:02.114
Anytime one of our team
members is called out,

07:02.181 --> 07:04.783
they must submit and
execute a disposal form.

07:04.849 --> 07:06.352
What's with the urgency?

07:06.418 --> 07:08.587
I mean, none of
that product has expired.

07:08.654 --> 07:10.222
There was an incident!

07:10.289 --> 07:12.391
We had an animal that
had a severe adverse reaction

07:12.458 --> 07:13.759
to the dosage

07:13.826 --> 07:15.127
and I cannot take a
chance of something like that

07:15.194 --> 07:16.861
happening at your facility.

07:16.929 --> 07:20.232
The best thing for you to do
is just destroy the shipment.

07:20.299 --> 07:22.935
Burn it and use whatever
you have on reserve.

07:23.001 --> 07:24.869
But you need to call
and confirm now.

07:24.937 --> 07:27.773
No, it is confirmed.

07:27.840 --> 07:29.375
We use an outside logistics firm

07:29.441 --> 07:31.777
that has no storage
space at their facility.

07:31.844 --> 07:33.112
They only perform a disposal

07:33.178 --> 07:34.680
of anything they pick
up at our lab.

07:34.747 --> 07:36.648
I got the paperwork
somewhere here in the office.

07:36.715 --> 07:38.883
You're sure?
Positive?

07:38.951 --> 07:40.085
Yeah, yeah.
It's all good.

07:40.152 --> 07:41.720
Everything's taken care of.

07:41.787 --> 07:44.490
I don't want to put anyone
at your park in danger.

07:44.556 --> 07:47.426
No, and I appreciate that and
we do not want that either.

07:47.493 --> 07:49.027
Thank you for
confirming, Daniel.

07:49.094 --> 07:50.963
You are welcome.
Bye-bye.

07:51.029 --> 07:52.698
I gotta go.

07:52.765 --> 07:56.001
Morning feed, VIP, As you always
say, I can't be late.

08:12.584 --> 08:15.254
Hey, good morning!

08:15.320 --> 08:18.223
And welcome to what I think
is the best part of

08:18.290 --> 08:22.094
the Shining Sea Aquarium,
the Shark Encounter.

08:22.161 --> 08:23.595
My name is Daniel and you are...

08:23.662 --> 08:25.063
- Skylar.
- Skylar.

08:25.130 --> 08:26.498
Did not know that
was also a dude's name.

08:26.565 --> 08:28.967
I'm one of
the senior aquarists here.

08:29.034 --> 08:30.769
And I will be your guide
on your meet and greet

08:30.836 --> 08:32.704
with some of the best
the park has to offer.

08:32.771 --> 08:34.239
Hey, man, this is pretty cool.

08:34.306 --> 08:35.374
Look, I've never done
anything like this.

08:35.441 --> 08:37.209
But, hey, it's my birthday,

08:37.276 --> 08:38.510
so I said let's try
something new today, right?

08:38.577 --> 08:40.312
- So it's your birthday?
- Yeah.

08:40.379 --> 08:41.814
Oh, it's your birthday,
it's your birthday.

08:41.880 --> 08:42.815
No, no, I'm kidding.

08:42.881 --> 08:44.416
Hey, this is for you.

08:44.483 --> 08:46.985
Got a couple of t-shirts
in there, some aquarium swag,

08:47.052 --> 08:49.221
a birthday gift
from your friends here

08:49.288 --> 08:50.489
at the Shining Sea Aquarium.

08:50.556 --> 08:51.924
Thank you.

08:51.990 --> 08:54.660
I also have some fish here
that our sharks like to eat,

08:54.726 --> 08:57.196
a little bonito, some cod,
some mackerel...

08:57.262 --> 08:59.531
Hey, a little broth,
some garlic and tomatoes,

08:59.598 --> 09:01.066
you got yourself
a bouillabaisse there.

09:01.133 --> 09:03.402
A dude named Skylar
who also cooks?

09:03.469 --> 09:04.770
It's a diverse world, man.

09:04.837 --> 09:06.238
Oh, it is now.

09:06.305 --> 09:07.639
But I'm in my second year
of nursing school.

09:07.706 --> 09:09.908
So I don't have time
for a love life,

09:09.975 --> 09:12.044
let alone a hot cooked meal.

09:12.110 --> 09:14.580
Well, you're in luck.
You don't have to cook this.

09:14.646 --> 09:15.581
They like to eat it raw.

09:15.647 --> 09:16.582
So do I.

09:16.648 --> 09:18.183
And here we are!

09:18.250 --> 09:22.354
The best shark experience
you'll ever experience.

09:23.689 --> 09:26.024
Now in this tank is
one of the fastest

09:26.091 --> 09:29.194
and most powerful sharks
in the ocean, the Maco.

09:29.261 --> 09:31.363
We work on a tunnel system here.

09:31.430 --> 09:35.434
So they have to swim through
that portal in order to feed.

09:35.501 --> 09:36.735
Ooh!

09:36.802 --> 09:40.372
It also gives us a front
row seat to the feast.

09:40.439 --> 09:41.840
Hey, they're pretty quick.

09:41.907 --> 09:44.610
Oh, yeah. They are amazing.

09:44.676 --> 09:48.547
They have 12 serrated teeth on
the upper jaw, 11 on the lower.

09:48.614 --> 09:51.550
You definitely don't want these
bad boys taken up in a tornado.

09:51.617 --> 09:53.252
Why would a shark
be in a tornado?

09:53.318 --> 09:55.721
You know... 'cause of the...

09:55.787 --> 09:57.957
Yeah, never mind.
It's a boomer joke.

09:58.023 --> 10:00.325
I think sharks are some of the
coolest creatures in the ocean.

10:00.392 --> 10:03.195
But I'm a fan
favorite of the walrus.

10:03.262 --> 10:04.730
- Get out!
- Yeah.

10:04.796 --> 10:06.966
You know, they're like
gentle giants, you know?

10:07.032 --> 10:08.367
Like those tusks? Man!

10:08.433 --> 10:09.868
Hey, would a shark
ever attack a walrus?

10:09.936 --> 10:11.870
No, no, no. They're never
in the same habitat.

10:11.938 --> 10:14.406
Macos like, uh,
sea turtles and other sharks.

10:14.473 --> 10:15.874
Huh.

10:15.942 --> 10:19.077
The tusks of a walrus and
the serrated teeth of a Maco...

10:19.144 --> 10:21.079
pretty good matchup.

10:21.146 --> 10:22.214
I got my money on a walrus.

10:22.281 --> 10:23.983
I think you'd lose that bet.

10:24.049 --> 10:27.686
- <i>Daniel, what is your 20?</i>
- Oh, I'm sorry. One second.

10:27.753 --> 10:30.489
Dan here on that
VIP feed like I told you.

10:30.556 --> 10:32.257
Okay. I just wanted to know
if you'd taken care

10:32.324 --> 10:34.159
of that Eden Zoo supply.

10:34.226 --> 10:36.562
Miranda, I took care of it.

10:36.628 --> 10:38.630
I've been here a while.
You gotta trust me.

10:38.697 --> 10:40.666
No, no, no.
It's not that I don't trust you.

10:40.732 --> 10:43.235
It's just...
I want this Senator Blackburn

10:43.302 --> 10:45.470
meeting to just
go perfectly.

10:46.872 --> 10:49.374
Anything for you, beautiful.

10:49.441 --> 10:50.842
Get back to work, Daniel.

10:54.313 --> 10:55.781
She's got a thing for me.

11:34.186 --> 11:35.821
All right, when we get in there,

11:35.887 --> 11:37.222
don't let me get caught up
in a debate with Miranda.

11:37.289 --> 11:38.958
Mm-hmm.

11:39.025 --> 11:41.293
If the conversation starts going
nowhere, get me out of there.

11:41.360 --> 11:42.461
I don't care what you tell her.

11:42.527 --> 11:45.897
- Understood?
- Yep, understood.

11:45.965 --> 11:47.934
I don't want to spend all day
in here with her,

11:48.001 --> 11:49.035
she'll complain constantly.

11:49.102 --> 11:50.369
Mm-hm.

11:50.435 --> 11:51.971
All right, what else
have you got?

11:52.038 --> 11:53.872
That guy from the Picayune
Herald paper called again.

11:53.940 --> 11:56.642
He wants to know if you're
planning on running for Governor

11:56.708 --> 11:59.411
after your tenure in the
State Senate comes to an end.

11:59.478 --> 12:01.213
Well, he's assuming
I am now, isn't he?

12:01.279 --> 12:02.781
Well, aren't you?

12:02.848 --> 12:04.083
Yes.

12:04.149 --> 12:07.053
My poll numbers are
through the roof.

12:07.120 --> 12:08.487
I'm not gonna give
that clown

12:08.553 --> 12:10.589
at the Picayune-Herald
an exclusive.

12:12.391 --> 12:13.425
- Okay.
- Just tell him "no comment".

12:13.492 --> 12:14.826
- Do that.
- Mm-hm.

12:14.893 --> 12:16.528
All right, what else?

12:16.595 --> 12:20.165
Uh, tomorrow, meeting with
the historic landmarks board.

12:20.232 --> 12:21.500
- Get that for me.
- Mm-hmm.

12:21.566 --> 12:24.536
No. Change that.
Reschedule it.

12:24.603 --> 12:27.506
There's no reason that
a barn built in 1903

12:27.572 --> 12:29.241
should stand in the way
of low-income housing

12:29.307 --> 12:31.810
for 32 families.

12:31.877 --> 12:33.178
All right.

12:33.245 --> 12:34.513
Senator Blackburn, good morning.

12:34.579 --> 12:37.349
- Good morning.
- Right on time, as usual.

12:37.416 --> 12:38.650
The senator has
a very tight schedule.

12:38.717 --> 12:40.385
We can't afford to fall behind.

12:40.452 --> 12:42.521
I had Beth pencil you
in so that we could listen

12:42.587 --> 12:44.489
to your concerns,
your complaints.

12:44.556 --> 12:46.625
And we're gonna come up
with solutions today, okay?

12:46.692 --> 12:49.028
Well, I really appreciate that.

12:49.095 --> 12:50.529
We have a lot to talk about.

13:16.688 --> 13:17.823
Oh!

13:26.331 --> 13:29.068
Hello? Hello?

13:44.951 --> 13:46.219
Come in?

13:46.284 --> 13:47.786
Clu? Miranda?
This is Dr. James!

13:47.853 --> 13:50.522
I need you both to
the veterinary wing now!

13:52.357 --> 13:54.193
Come in!
This is Dr. James!

13:54.259 --> 13:55.928
Come in!

13:55.995 --> 13:56.929
Come in...

13:56.996 --> 14:01.399
No... No. No!

14:04.603 --> 14:07.806
<i>Come in! Come in!
Clu? Miranda?</i>

14:09.175 --> 14:10.475
I'm on my way.

14:10.542 --> 14:12.377
Christie, meet me
at the Veterinary.

14:12.444 --> 14:14.147
I'm on it.

14:14.213 --> 14:15.480
<i>I'll be down in a second.</i>

14:15.547 --> 14:17.682
Hey, Clu, can you
see what Karen needs?

14:17.749 --> 14:19.451
I'm with the senator right now.

14:19.518 --> 14:22.121
- <i>Okay, will do.</i>
- Thanks.

14:22.188 --> 14:25.290
I am so sorry.
Where was I?

14:25.357 --> 14:27.692
Oh, right.

14:27.759 --> 14:30.762
Our facility is in need
of some major

14:30.829 --> 14:34.733
technological infrastructure
upgrades for over a decade now.

14:34.800 --> 14:37.970
I mean, our connection
network is so antiquated,

14:38.037 --> 14:40.106
we could put
the components on display

14:40.173 --> 14:43.575
at the Maritime History Wing.

14:43.642 --> 14:47.280
Look, we need a new heating
and cooling system

14:47.345 --> 14:49.314
for all of the enclosures,

14:49.381 --> 14:51.783
upgraded water toxicity sensors.

14:51.850 --> 14:55.854
Our animal safety mechanisms
are so inadequate

14:55.921 --> 14:58.490
because we don't even have a
high-speed network connection.

14:58.557 --> 15:00.492
What about some of
the local supportive initiatives

15:00.559 --> 15:01.994
that we discussed?

15:02.061 --> 15:05.730
Direct and in-kind donations,
ticket sales?

15:05.797 --> 15:08.567
I mean, they might keep the
lights on and the animals fed.

15:08.633 --> 15:12.138
But gift shop sales
aren't going to cut it.

15:12.205 --> 15:14.606
What about an online store?

15:14.673 --> 15:17.009
There you go.
That'll generate some revenue.

15:17.076 --> 15:18.410
Write that down.

15:18.476 --> 15:20.779
Great.
Get me the funding.

15:22.949 --> 15:26.818
I need financing, the kind
of financing that you can get.

15:26.885 --> 15:30.089
Sponsors,
corporate partnerships,

15:30.156 --> 15:32.557
one of those black tie galas

15:32.624 --> 15:35.261
that we can bring in
new sponsors and donors.

15:35.328 --> 15:38.864
You might be the CEO and
president of this facility,

15:38.931 --> 15:42.767
but I am the one who is keeping
these animals safe and healthy.

15:42.834 --> 15:45.470
And you're very
much appreciated for it.

15:45.537 --> 15:48.540
Look, for all the talk
of conservation

15:48.607 --> 15:50.709
we do for this facility,

15:50.775 --> 15:54.247
we need so many upgrades to
get this place to go green.

15:56.848 --> 15:59.751
Look, I can...
I can ask for funding,

15:59.818 --> 16:01.287
but it's gonna have
to be after the first

16:01.354 --> 16:02.888
of the fiscal year, okay?

16:02.955 --> 16:04.789
Doing great here.

16:04.856 --> 16:06.825
Every penny that goes
into this facility

16:06.892 --> 16:09.794
goes back to these amazing
and incredible creatures!

16:17.435 --> 16:19.638
Wow.

16:19.704 --> 16:22.908
So... So let me
get this straight.

16:22.975 --> 16:24.576
You're saying
this was an octopus?

16:24.643 --> 16:27.013
The duct.
It's in the duct!

16:27.079 --> 16:29.614
It killed Hyde and Price and
then it went into the...

16:29.681 --> 16:31.250
Slow down, slow down.

16:31.317 --> 16:32.450
Okay.

16:32.517 --> 16:33.585
What happened, Dr. James?

16:33.652 --> 16:35.154
It killed them.

16:35.221 --> 16:38.523
We must close the duct
before it gets out!

16:38.590 --> 16:41.127
This animal has
become reanimated.

16:41.193 --> 16:44.163
And there's no telling
the level of toxic bacteria

16:44.230 --> 16:48.466
growing in its body or
if it will attack again!

16:50.937 --> 16:52.004
Gotcha.

17:14.492 --> 17:16.195
Okay, we gotta move fast.

17:16.262 --> 17:18.697
But we can't close
all the ducts down at once.

17:18.763 --> 17:21.900
Unfortunately, every vent
has to be shut down manually

17:21.968 --> 17:24.036
in every room, hall and
exhibit in the building.

17:24.103 --> 17:25.737
We also got to let
Miranda know

17:25.804 --> 17:27.073
that we got to go
on lockdown now.

17:27.139 --> 17:28.673
Yeah.

17:30.209 --> 17:32.144
Miranda.

17:32.211 --> 17:33.645
Do you hear me, Miranda?

17:33.712 --> 17:35.081
Miranda, do you copy?

17:35.147 --> 17:37.782
- She's with the senator, right?
- Yes.

17:37.849 --> 17:39.085
She may have turned
off her radio.

17:39.151 --> 17:41.087
- I'll go find her.
- Okay.

17:44.489 --> 17:46.791
Christie?
Christie, come in!

17:46.858 --> 17:48.626
<i>Hey Clu, go for Christie.</i>

17:48.693 --> 17:50.196
Christie, we have an
animal on the loose,

17:50.262 --> 17:52.664
possibly inside of the ducts.

17:52.731 --> 17:54.532
It killed two of
our vet techs.

17:54.599 --> 17:58.636
Conduct a sweep of every room in
the wing in case it slipped out.

17:58.703 --> 18:01.407
<i>Do not approach.
You radio me if you see it.</i>

18:01.474 --> 18:02.942
Copy?

18:03.009 --> 18:04.176
Copy that.

18:09.982 --> 18:13.618
So, for example,
on Tuesdays and Fridays,

18:13.685 --> 18:15.854
we have started
doing a VIP Experience

18:15.920 --> 18:18.190
before the aquarium opens.

18:18.257 --> 18:22.194
If we started to do more of
this, then maybe we could...

18:22.261 --> 18:23.795
Karen?

18:25.131 --> 18:30.835
Karen, what's wrong?
What happened?

18:30.902 --> 18:32.871
Sorry about this, Hannah.

18:32.938 --> 18:36.342
I know Miranda's devastated...

18:36.409 --> 18:37.842
And, uh...

19:17.882 --> 19:19.318
Dr. James, what happened?

19:19.385 --> 19:22.687
It killed them and
it almost killed me...

19:22.754 --> 19:24.056
- What?
- Wait.

19:24.123 --> 19:26.559
Who is dead?
What is she talking about?

19:26.624 --> 19:28.094
The octopus.

19:28.160 --> 19:30.463
We brought it in for
a tagging blend.

19:30.529 --> 19:32.364
There were
post-op complications.

19:32.431 --> 19:33.598
It went into cardiac arrest.

19:33.665 --> 19:35.867
I administered the standard IE

19:35.935 --> 19:38.736
and now it's crawled
into the duct.

19:38.803 --> 19:41.773
For all we know, it's already
managed to escape the building.

19:41.840 --> 19:45.910
Okay, we are officially
closing for the day

19:45.978 --> 19:47.679
and we're going on the lockdown.

19:47.745 --> 19:49.048
- Okay.
- I'm gonna contact the police.

19:49.115 --> 19:51.649
Clu, can you come in?
Copy.

19:51.716 --> 19:54.886
Miranda, what's your 20?
I've been trying to reach you!

19:54.954 --> 19:56.654
We're in the main concourse.

19:56.721 --> 20:00.226
This animal has
become reanimated.

20:01.594 --> 20:04.063
Did you...
did you say reanimated?

20:04.130 --> 20:06.764
Oh, come on!
That is impossible.

20:08.134 --> 20:09.168
Okay...

20:11.437 --> 20:12.538
- Karen...
- Yeah?

20:12.605 --> 20:14.672
Tell me what happened.

20:14.739 --> 20:18.310
We may have a viral outbreak
on our hands

20:18.377 --> 20:21.947
that could infect and kill every
living thing in this facility.

20:22.847 --> 20:24.450
- What?
- I know, I know.

20:31.789 --> 20:33.392
What... was that?

20:36.728 --> 20:39.999
That is extreme pacing behavior

20:40.065 --> 20:44.203
and they're doing it
at the same time.

20:46.005 --> 20:48.507
Oh, my God, they're trying
to compromise the tank!

20:48.574 --> 20:51.143
Run! Run!

21:07.159 --> 21:09.328
Miranda! Come in! Miranda!

21:09.395 --> 21:10.695
What's going on?

21:10.762 --> 21:11.997
I'm calling 911 now.

21:14.732 --> 21:17.169
That's water.

21:17.236 --> 21:19.305
One of the tanks
has been compromised.

21:21.739 --> 21:23.108
We're officially
going into lockdown.

21:23.175 --> 21:24.776
I'm not getting trapped in here!

21:24.842 --> 21:26.312
I'll get on the boat
and get help!

21:26.378 --> 21:27.947
Christie!

21:28.013 --> 21:29.881
Christie... Christie, wait!

21:37.223 --> 21:38.390
Oh, my purse!

21:40.858 --> 21:42.161
Just leave it!

21:42.228 --> 21:43.929
The water pressure
will kill you!

21:47.933 --> 21:50.970
Christie, if you can hear me,
radio back when you reach help.

21:51.036 --> 21:53.305
I'll try to override the
lockdown and let you in.

21:56.242 --> 21:57.509
Oh my God.

22:07.453 --> 22:08.387
Oh my God.

22:34.846 --> 22:36.415
Hey, what's going on?
This normal?

22:36.482 --> 22:38.484
Could be a variety of things.
Hang on a second.

22:38.550 --> 22:39.485
Like what?

22:39.551 --> 22:40.818
Miranda, this is Daniel.

22:40.885 --> 22:42.087
Can you tell me
the source of the alarm?

22:44.089 --> 22:46.392
Miranda, Daniel.
Come in.

22:46.458 --> 22:47.393
I'm just gonna call 911.

22:49.662 --> 22:51.297
Yes, 911?

22:51.363 --> 22:53.365
I think there's a fire
at the Shining Sea Aquarium!

22:53.432 --> 22:54.799
Can you send someone?

22:54.866 --> 22:57.736
Yes, that's my current location!
Can you send someone?

22:57.802 --> 22:59.038
Thank you, thank you.

22:59.104 --> 23:01.707
We gotta go through
the other way.

23:01.774 --> 23:03.509
Why isn't the door opening?

23:03.575 --> 23:04.909
Because the door is locked.

23:04.977 --> 23:06.578
We are on lockdown.

23:06.645 --> 23:08.013
One of the tanks must
have breached or something.

23:08.080 --> 23:09.682
Lockdown?
What do you mean?

23:09.748 --> 23:11.016
- We're stuck here?
- Don't worry about it.

23:11.083 --> 23:12.484
There's no fire or anything.

23:12.551 --> 23:14.086
Otherwise, the sprinklers
would have gone off.

23:14.153 --> 23:15.688
But I just told 911
there's a fire!

23:15.754 --> 23:17.356
Dude, it doesn't matter
what you told them.

23:17.423 --> 23:18.624
They can't get in
and we can't get out

23:18.691 --> 23:19.891
until the lockdown is over.

23:19.958 --> 23:21.859
So chill out.
Follow the leader.

23:21.927 --> 23:24.229
We've got to go through
the Sea Otter Exhibit, okay?

23:26.898 --> 23:28.133
We're already here.

23:29.168 --> 23:31.670
My purse got swept away
in the water!

23:31.737 --> 23:33.372
You lost my phone?

23:33.439 --> 23:35.507
I had everything in
there, mine and yours.

23:35.574 --> 23:37.476
Miranda!

23:37.543 --> 23:39.278
No.

23:39.345 --> 23:40.412
Dr. James?

23:40.479 --> 23:42.981
I left mine charging
in my office

23:43.048 --> 23:45.417
when I went in to surgery
on the octopus!

23:45.484 --> 23:48.053
The fire doors close
each quadrant.

23:48.120 --> 23:50.189
The alarm is going.
Help is on the way!

23:50.255 --> 23:52.091
Will this thing every turn off?

23:52.157 --> 23:54.126
Yeah, it'll turn off
in a second.

24:01.533 --> 24:03.035
Okay.

24:03.102 --> 24:06.004
So, basically, each quadrant
works independently.

24:06.071 --> 24:08.173
When there's a fire,
they all shut

24:08.240 --> 24:10.743
so it doesn't spread
to protect the animals.

24:10.809 --> 24:11.977
It should
do the same for flooding

24:12.044 --> 24:13.412
and keep the animals contained.

24:13.479 --> 24:15.013
But we need to get
out of here, so why...

24:15.080 --> 24:16.615
Would you stop!

24:18.883 --> 24:21.320
Please, just stay calm.

24:21.387 --> 24:24.189
- I'm sorry.
- No, no.

24:24.256 --> 24:28.827
Don't be sorry.
Just stay calm.

24:28.893 --> 24:30.562
We won't be in here very long.

24:30.629 --> 24:32.498
We'll be out of here soon.
Just relax.

24:32.564 --> 24:36.368
Just as long as we can get
the failsafe protocols released.

24:36.435 --> 24:40.205
Clu, are you there?
Are you okay?

24:42.508 --> 24:45.577
Yes, but Christie
didn't make it.

24:51.183 --> 24:52.484
Where are you?

24:52.551 --> 24:54.420
I'm headed to the Central Access
to see

24:54.486 --> 24:56.288
if all that water
shorted the breakers

24:56.355 --> 24:59.091
and find out what's online
and what's down.

24:59.158 --> 25:01.193
If I can reboot the system,
I can get us out of here.

25:04.496 --> 25:06.765
For now, the only contact
we have with the outside world

25:06.832 --> 25:08.267
is through cellphones.

25:08.333 --> 25:10.669
And if the surveillance
systems are down,

25:10.736 --> 25:13.305
we're pretty much moving blind
through this place.

25:22.581 --> 25:25.117
Brother, come on, man.

25:25.184 --> 25:27.953
You survived Tahoe,
60 miles an hour

25:28.020 --> 25:30.055
down a black slope
with a busted boot.

25:30.122 --> 25:31.924
You can't handle this?

25:31.990 --> 25:33.759
Come on, man!
Marry the girl!

25:33.826 --> 25:35.561
- You're right, you're right.
- Of course, I'm right!

25:35.627 --> 25:37.296
<i>Nearby units?</i>

25:37.362 --> 25:40.299
<i>Reports of activated 1070
at Shining Sea Aquarium.</i>

25:40.365 --> 25:42.434
This is 19.
Copy that.

25:42.501 --> 25:47.139
We are about 30 minutes out,
but we're on our way.

25:47.206 --> 25:50.142
<i>Copy that, 19.
Proceed with caution.</i>

25:50.209 --> 25:52.077
You got it.
Copy that.

25:52.144 --> 25:53.378
Let's talk about the ring.

26:19.071 --> 26:20.639
Miranda?

26:20.706 --> 26:22.207
Miranda, come in.

26:27.379 --> 26:30.148
Miranda, I think
the octopus was here.

26:32.952 --> 26:34.186
It might be on the move.

26:35.087 --> 26:38.123
Copy, Clu.
Be careful.

26:38.190 --> 26:39.458
Stay alert.

26:39.525 --> 26:42.794
Copy. You too.

26:42.861 --> 26:45.697
Okay, I'm gonna check in
to see if the coast is clear.

26:53.705 --> 26:55.541
It's clear. Come on, let's go.
Hurry, hurry.

27:06.852 --> 27:08.053
Okay.

27:09.154 --> 27:10.822
Come on.

27:10.889 --> 27:12.090
Come on, come on.

27:12.157 --> 27:14.726
Give me something.
Come on.

27:18.130 --> 27:19.966
Hello?

27:20.033 --> 27:21.333
Can anybody hear me?

27:22.768 --> 27:24.670
<i>Hello?</i>

27:24.736 --> 27:25.804
Is anybody there?

27:31.577 --> 27:33.579
Don't touch the fence!
It's electrified!

27:33.645 --> 27:35.048
What?

27:35.113 --> 27:37.182
No!

27:39.284 --> 27:40.719
What was that, man?

27:40.786 --> 27:42.287
I ain't never seen
otters act like that!

27:42.354 --> 27:43.990
I don't know.
I haven't either.

27:44.057 --> 27:45.357
Something is up
with the animals.

27:45.424 --> 27:47.259
What you trying to do?

27:47.326 --> 27:49.963
I thought I could
turn off the fence.

27:50.029 --> 27:52.130
But I don't have a key
and we're surrounded by it.

27:52.197 --> 27:53.565
Okay, well, we need
to figure something out.

27:53.632 --> 27:55.167
Like we can get
a ladder or something!

27:55.233 --> 27:56.501
Inside.

27:56.568 --> 27:57.803
Well, let's stack
some tables up!

27:57.869 --> 27:59.237
Bolted to the ground!

27:59.304 --> 28:00.772
Okay, we need to figure out
something, okay?

28:00.839 --> 28:03.208
We're smarter than the fish!
We got hands!

28:03.275 --> 28:06.079
All right, number one,
dude, that is speciest.

28:06.144 --> 28:08.513
Two, otters are mammals.

28:08.580 --> 28:10.382
We just need to get
inside the aquarium.

28:10.449 --> 28:12.451
You wanna go back...
back inside there

28:12.517 --> 28:14.419
with the rest of those mammals?

28:14.486 --> 28:16.688
There's just fish tanks,
there's no mammals.

28:16.755 --> 28:18.057
Okay, but what
about them sharks?

28:18.123 --> 28:19.725
I remember how fast they were!

28:19.791 --> 28:21.193
Last time I checked,
they don't walk, hop or skip.

28:21.259 --> 28:22.494
I think we'll be fine.

28:22.561 --> 28:24.363
Yeah, but they
got teeth, remember?

28:24.429 --> 28:26.832
Yes, behind two feet
of transparent acrylic!

28:26.898 --> 28:28.133
They're not gonna
break through that!

28:28.200 --> 28:29.936
Okay.

28:30.003 --> 28:31.203
So... but how do
we get back in?

28:31.269 --> 28:32.504
We're locked out, remember?

28:32.571 --> 28:34.740
There are tunnels
under the aquarium.

28:34.806 --> 28:35.774
Tunnels?

28:35.841 --> 28:37.110
Yes, yes, with offices.

28:37.175 --> 28:38.543
Okay, with offices.

28:38.610 --> 28:40.312
- And telephones!
- Okay. They got a restroom?

28:40.379 --> 28:42.081
Yeah, and a candy machine too.

28:42.147 --> 28:45.751
Good. You need a candy bar.
You're a little hangry.

28:45.817 --> 28:47.619
Sorry.
Just a little stressed.

28:51.657 --> 28:53.625
Okay, everything is locked down,

28:53.692 --> 28:56.828
so we need to find another
option other than the doors.

28:56.895 --> 28:59.431
Clu is working on a way out,

28:59.498 --> 29:01.600
but I don't think
she's going get us out in time.

29:04.503 --> 29:08.407
Okay, everyone just stay quiet
and stay behind me.

29:08.473 --> 29:10.943
What? What's that?

29:11.010 --> 29:13.745
Shh!
Just keep moving.

29:13.812 --> 29:14.780
Miranda, what is it?

29:14.846 --> 29:16.548
Sounds like crocodiles.

29:23.588 --> 29:28.527
Just stay quiet and follow.

29:30.163 --> 29:31.863
I knew it!

29:35.867 --> 29:36.902
Get down.

30:19.745 --> 30:23.315
Okay, I think it's gone.
Let's move.

30:23.381 --> 30:24.683
Okay.

30:25.952 --> 30:28.020
There it is.

30:29.855 --> 30:30.889
Run!

30:30.957 --> 30:32.657
Oh, Jesus, go!

30:34.093 --> 30:36.628
Quick!
Quick! In here!

30:42.801 --> 30:46.438
The nearest water is at the
front entrance of the place.

30:46.505 --> 30:48.273
I don't see any smoke.

30:49.942 --> 30:52.711
Well, maybe they got it under
control and didn't cancel.

30:54.180 --> 30:56.681
It's a fire until
we find out it's not.

30:59.618 --> 31:01.254
It's also locked.

31:01.319 --> 31:03.990
I thought this place was open.

31:04.056 --> 31:08.094
Dispatch, this is 19.
We're on the property.

31:08.161 --> 31:09.394
Not seeing anyone on site

31:09.461 --> 31:11.264
nor am I seeing any
kind of emergency.

31:11.329 --> 31:13.099
Caller didn't cancel?
Over.

31:13.166 --> 31:14.299
<i>Negative. No cancel.</i>

31:14.366 --> 31:16.002
Copy.

31:16.068 --> 31:18.870
We'll do a lap around the
property, confirm false alarm.

31:18.938 --> 31:20.872
In the meantime,
can you get us information

31:20.940 --> 31:23.675
on maybe head of security
or someone on site?

31:23.742 --> 31:25.644
Copy that.
Be careful.

31:25.710 --> 31:26.678
Over.

31:26.745 --> 31:28.080
Let's check it out.

31:33.852 --> 31:35.821
I got the number.
I'll give 'em a call.

31:38.657 --> 31:39.791
Keep getting a message.

31:42.861 --> 31:44.362
It's the main switchboard.

31:44.429 --> 31:45.630
Hours of Operation.

31:47.766 --> 31:49.534
They're not open 'til 11 a.m.

31:49.601 --> 31:51.103
Let's check around back.

31:55.440 --> 31:57.642
I think we need to find
some armor or something.

31:57.709 --> 31:59.178
Armor?

31:59.245 --> 32:00.213
Armor, dude?

32:00.279 --> 32:01.214
Yes!

32:01.280 --> 32:02.581
What are you gonna do?

32:02.647 --> 32:03.582
Lay down and let
'em roll you around?

32:03.648 --> 32:06.585
What we need is this.

32:07.652 --> 32:09.255
What about me?
I need one!

32:09.322 --> 32:11.090
I need an ax for this creepy
pirate ship you got me on!

32:11.157 --> 32:12.657
It's Pirate's Bay!

32:12.724 --> 32:14.693
Okay. Now a pirate fish
gonna come attack me now?

32:14.759 --> 32:16.229
Relax. It's a kid's area.

32:16.295 --> 32:18.463
Oh, ain't no skeletons
or Krakens gonna come?

32:18.530 --> 32:21.133
No. That was last season.

32:30.842 --> 32:32.345
- Damn it!
- Damn, it won't open?

32:32.410 --> 32:33.511
It won't open!

32:33.578 --> 32:36.349
- Why not?
- It's locked!

32:36.414 --> 32:37.849
So what do we do?
What do we do?

32:37.916 --> 32:38.951
Whatever we can!

32:39.018 --> 32:40.319
Whatever we can?
Whatever you can!

32:40.385 --> 32:42.454
You're the one with the ax!

32:42.520 --> 32:43.822
Oh, damn.

32:44.890 --> 32:45.992
Come and get it!

32:48.327 --> 32:49.362
Ah!

32:51.230 --> 32:54.000
What do I do? Oh! Ah!

32:54.066 --> 32:55.268
- What do I do?
- Get it off me!

32:55.334 --> 32:57.303
- How?
- The ax!

32:57.370 --> 33:00.139
Oh, God, no!

33:00.206 --> 33:01.307
No, no, no, no, no!

33:01.374 --> 33:02.607
Whack it!
Don't crack it!

33:06.312 --> 33:08.047
Ah!

33:08.114 --> 33:09.781
Woo!
Take that, bitch!

33:14.320 --> 33:16.855
Oh, God!

33:21.493 --> 33:23.195
That was not fun!

33:23.262 --> 33:25.064
Where's the first aid kit?

33:26.365 --> 33:27.699
Gimme that.

33:29.768 --> 33:31.370
You know, maybe
I should hold the ax.

33:31.436 --> 33:33.438
Oh! Oh!

33:33.505 --> 33:36.008
Ah!

33:39.045 --> 33:40.346
Ah!

33:40.413 --> 33:42.914
Should have got that armor
when I had the chance!

33:45.384 --> 33:49.021
You're fixing my face!

33:49.088 --> 33:52.590
We can't stay here forever!
Let's see if it wandered off.

33:56.429 --> 33:57.762
I think it's gone.

33:59.332 --> 34:00.465
I'll go first.

34:06.272 --> 34:09.008
Listen, we need to
find the nearest door

34:09.075 --> 34:11.609
and smash our way
through the glass.

34:11.676 --> 34:13.145
That won't work.

34:13.212 --> 34:14.813
Why? It worked for the fish.

34:14.879 --> 34:17.816
There are 100 species
of wildlife

34:17.882 --> 34:21.020
propelling through thousands
of pounds of weight,

34:21.087 --> 34:24.357
through hundreds of thousands
of gallons of water.

34:24.423 --> 34:26.658
There's got to be a way
to smash through it!

34:28.427 --> 34:29.828
It's reinforced with Lucite

34:29.894 --> 34:32.731
and then coated with
a commercial window tint.

34:32.797 --> 34:34.699
Even if you were to crack it,

34:34.766 --> 34:37.269
it's engineered not to break.

34:38.870 --> 34:42.108
You can't cut it
and you can't tear it.

34:46.611 --> 34:48.280
Well, the fish figured it out,

34:48.347 --> 34:50.950
and I can't accept that
fish are smarter than us.

34:53.352 --> 34:55.820
There has to be a release
latch or a mechanism

34:55.887 --> 34:57.756
of some sort that
can open these doors.

34:57.822 --> 34:59.557
It won't work.

34:59.624 --> 35:02.928
The only way the doors are open
is from the Central Access

35:02.995 --> 35:04.896
so the surveillance
cameras can see

35:04.964 --> 35:06.564
what's behind them
before they're open.

35:06.631 --> 35:09.969
We are not getting into
the next quadrant through here.

35:11.669 --> 35:13.372
We're gonna have to double back.

35:13.439 --> 35:14.639
Oh, God.

35:14.706 --> 35:17.542
Uh... Guys, look.

35:19.979 --> 35:22.248
Crush them! That's the only
way to stop them!

35:30.523 --> 35:32.091
Ah! Help!

35:33.159 --> 35:35.461
Ah! Help me!

35:35.528 --> 35:36.561
Help get this off me!

35:36.628 --> 35:38.563
Help, help me!
Help!

35:41.967 --> 35:43.936
Ow!

35:44.003 --> 35:45.371
- Come on, get up! Get up!
- They're still coming!

35:45.438 --> 35:46.905
Hurry! Hurry!

35:50.042 --> 35:52.577
Quick! Back in the theater!

35:56.415 --> 35:58.883
God Damn it!

36:13.765 --> 36:15.733
Everyone get back!

36:20.506 --> 36:22.074
Starfish!

36:22.141 --> 36:24.477
- Oh!
- Ah!

36:31.550 --> 36:33.718
- Karen!
- Get back!

36:36.621 --> 36:40.658
Oh, God, okay.
Karen, Karen, just stop!

36:40.725 --> 36:41.961
Stop!

36:45.630 --> 36:47.399
You have to crush
their radial nerve

36:47.466 --> 36:50.236
along that ambulacral region.

36:50.302 --> 36:52.138
Destroying the
central nervous

36:52.204 --> 36:54.140
seems like the only thing
that stops them.

36:54.206 --> 36:56.075
That is crazy.

36:56.142 --> 36:58.410
That kind of starfish
isn't supposed

36:58.477 --> 37:01.347
to survive outside of the water
for more than a couple minutes.

37:01.413 --> 37:03.582
Water pumps through
its body, not blood.

37:03.648 --> 37:05.850
They don't have any blood?

37:05.917 --> 37:08.920
No, nor a brain,
not in the typical sense.

37:08.988 --> 37:12.391
That species emits
a toxin usually harmless.

37:12.458 --> 37:15.693
You get stung, there's some
minor vomiting at the worst,

37:15.760 --> 37:17.896
but we can't take that risk.

37:17.963 --> 37:19.932
With this lockdown,
no one will be able

37:19.999 --> 37:22.667
to get here on time
to save your life!

37:22.734 --> 37:25.037
That octopus that escaped...

37:25.104 --> 37:27.940
Also secretes a venom.
All octopi do.

37:28.007 --> 37:29.807
They're mostly non-toxic,

37:29.874 --> 37:32.645
except for the blue-ringed,
which is lethal.

37:32.710 --> 37:35.548
Is that a blue-ringed one?

37:35.614 --> 37:36.748
No.

37:36.814 --> 37:38.850
And that's what worries me.

37:38.917 --> 37:41.920
Dr. Hyde was bitten and
died from acute paralysis,

37:41.987 --> 37:44.223
probably within minutes.

37:44.290 --> 37:46.358
Whatever's happening
to these animals

37:46.425 --> 37:49.094
is also making
their secretions more potent.

37:49.161 --> 37:51.931
Okay, what is happening to them?

37:51.997 --> 37:53.399
They're dead.

37:54.832 --> 37:57.236
But not dead.

37:57.303 --> 37:58.470
Huh?

37:59.672 --> 38:01.574
The toxicity of the octopus

38:01.640 --> 38:04.376
must have been spread across
the aquarium like a virus.

38:06.711 --> 38:08.380
Look, I don't think
we're gonna have enough time.

38:08.447 --> 38:10.382
We just need to keep moving.

38:10.449 --> 38:12.451
But Clu is trying to get us
out of here, right?

38:12.518 --> 38:14.386
Yeah, but after
the last three times,

38:14.453 --> 38:17.223
I don't think
it's gonna be quick enough.

38:20.059 --> 38:21.961
We could try the roof.

38:22.027 --> 38:24.396
There is a door...
There's an access door there.

38:24.463 --> 38:26.864
Yeah. Yeah, we go
where there's no water, right?

38:26.932 --> 38:30.035
We go to the roof
and we call for help.

38:30.102 --> 38:32.338
And maybe somebody
from the street will see us.

38:32.404 --> 38:34.173
Maybe, yeah.

38:35.241 --> 38:36.342
There it is.

38:39.945 --> 38:41.347
I'm pretty sure it's locked.

38:41.413 --> 38:43.115
No, no.
I come down here all the time.

38:43.182 --> 38:44.882
It just needs
a little elbow grease.

38:44.950 --> 38:46.018
- Need some help?
- I got it.

38:46.085 --> 38:47.453
You sure about that?

38:47.519 --> 38:49.388
Dude, I work out all the time.

38:49.455 --> 38:50.522
Okay, He-man.

38:51.590 --> 38:53.125
Hey, what's that over there?

39:01.600 --> 39:03.035
I loosened it for you.

39:03.102 --> 39:05.738
Sometimes it takes brains,
not always brawn.

39:05.803 --> 39:08.140
Dude, so uncalled for.

39:19.118 --> 39:20.519
Those crabs had it out for you.

39:20.586 --> 39:22.121
Yeah.

39:22.187 --> 39:25.457
I think they know they're
not my favorite exhibit.

39:25.524 --> 39:27.993
I guess I'm getting
the real tour now, huh?

39:28.060 --> 39:31.030
Dude, I think you
are getting a refund.

39:31.096 --> 39:32.398
Hey, this doesn't
lead outside, does it?

39:32.464 --> 39:34.433
No, no.
It's like a bunker.

39:34.500 --> 39:38.337
Half the park and
the aquarium are above us.

39:38.404 --> 39:39.837
Great. We can stay
down here, right?

39:39.904 --> 39:41.674
Absofrickinglutely!

39:41.740 --> 39:44.043
Good. Where's the bathroom?
I'm about to piss my pants.

39:44.109 --> 39:45.778
I think I already did.

39:45.843 --> 39:47.112
It's down to your left.

40:00.793 --> 40:01.960
Ah...

40:02.027 --> 40:03.762
I'm still not seeing anything.

40:03.828 --> 40:05.030
I still get the same recording.

40:05.097 --> 40:06.465
Maybe the phones
are down in there.

40:12.037 --> 40:13.439
Well, what do you want to do?

40:13.505 --> 40:15.107
Dispatch just sent me
a number for

40:15.174 --> 40:17.909
the security manager for
this place...

40:17.976 --> 40:19.011
Cluwirth.

40:19.078 --> 40:20.412
I'll give her a call.

40:26.185 --> 40:27.686
Let's go.
Let's go check it out.

40:27.753 --> 40:29.388
Well, let's do one more
sweep and we'll call it.

40:29.455 --> 40:31.056
- Let's do it.
- All right.

40:33.525 --> 40:34.859
Clu?

40:34.926 --> 40:36.462
Clu, hello?
Are you there?

40:36.528 --> 40:38.997
Clu, talk to me.

40:39.064 --> 40:40.466
Miranda, I'm here.

40:40.532 --> 40:42.668
<i>Are you okay?</i>

40:42.735 --> 40:44.236
You're not hurt, are you?

40:44.303 --> 40:46.372
Clu, what is your status?
How bad is it up there?

40:46.438 --> 40:48.774
It's bad.

40:48.841 --> 40:50.642
The whole top of the desk

40:50.709 --> 40:54.246
is covered with grease
or slime, I guess.

40:54.313 --> 40:56.014
I think the octopus
left it here.

40:59.385 --> 41:03.455
Okay, Clu, be very,
very careful if it comes back.

41:03.522 --> 41:05.691
There's something
happening to the animals.

41:05.758 --> 41:08.827
They're everywhere
and they're attacking.

41:08.893 --> 41:11.497
Ask her how to get out of here.

41:12.731 --> 41:15.434
Listen, Clu, we're in
the Theater Box Office.

41:15.501 --> 41:17.269
Do you know the quickest
way to get out of here?

41:17.336 --> 41:19.138
And what's
working and what isn't?

41:19.204 --> 41:21.306
At the moment, no, I don't.

41:21.373 --> 41:25.244
It's gonna take maybe
half an hour at the least,

41:25.310 --> 41:27.279
maybe more, to repair the desk.

41:29.914 --> 41:35.020
But at the time, I have
no operational capability.

41:35.087 --> 41:36.488
A half hour?

41:39.091 --> 41:42.227
Would somebody please
tell me why this desk

41:42.294 --> 41:44.630
means so much to us
getting out of the aquarium?

41:44.696 --> 41:48.100
Because without it,
we're not getting out of here.

41:51.103 --> 41:53.338
That console monitors
all of the security

41:53.405 --> 41:56.575
and all of the surveillance
on the entire property

41:56.642 --> 41:59.111
which regulates and
overrides anything

41:59.178 --> 42:01.914
that is triggered
in the unlikely event

42:01.980 --> 42:03.949
a tank is breached.

42:04.016 --> 42:05.217
Wonderful.

42:06.385 --> 42:08.353
Clu, do we have any roof access?

42:08.420 --> 42:10.489
What about getting
out from there?

42:13.425 --> 42:15.093
Uh, no go.

42:15.160 --> 42:17.629
Access to the roof
is on the same locking mechanism

42:17.696 --> 42:18.664
as the steel doors.

42:23.135 --> 42:25.170
In the meantime,
if you all are in the theater,

42:25.237 --> 42:26.972
that puts you in Quad Two.

42:27.039 --> 42:28.407
Now those doors
aren't designed

42:28.474 --> 42:30.375
to keep out flooding,
only fires.

42:30.442 --> 42:32.144
So I wouldn't go back
in the Box Office

42:32.211 --> 42:33.846
because if the water
gets through, you're all

42:33.912 --> 42:36.281
going to keep on moving
until it's safely to do so.

42:36.348 --> 42:38.617
- Copy?
- Copy that.

42:40.219 --> 42:42.187
<i>Be careful out there.</i>

42:43.388 --> 42:44.923
- Marvelous.
- We'll keep moving

42:44.990 --> 42:46.592
and check back with you later.

42:46.658 --> 42:47.726
Gotcha.

42:50.028 --> 42:51.263
Oh, yeah.

42:51.330 --> 42:53.232
This scar's gonna get me laid.

42:53.298 --> 42:55.534
Man, this place is rank.

42:55.601 --> 42:56.970
Pretty sure you guys
didn't pass health code.

42:57.035 --> 42:59.471
Yeah.

43:00.539 --> 43:01.707
So why a nurse?

43:01.773 --> 43:03.876
Why not doctor,
you know, make the cash?

43:03.943 --> 43:06.311
Really?

43:06.378 --> 43:07.713
Why a middle-aged tour guide

43:07.779 --> 43:09.448
and not the executive
running the joint?

43:09.515 --> 43:11.149
Middle-aged?

43:11.216 --> 43:13.418
I am younger than I look.

43:13.485 --> 43:16.956
Besides, management
just isn't for me.

43:17.022 --> 43:19.558
The Shining Sea Aquarium
is not my life.

43:19.625 --> 43:20.592
I got plans.

43:20.659 --> 43:22.528
Plans, huh? Really?

43:24.763 --> 43:27.032
Aw, damn!

43:27.099 --> 43:28.767
Not those spider crabs again!

43:28.834 --> 43:33.105
Okay, okay. I think we need
to move up into the aquarium.

43:33.171 --> 43:35.207
Up in the aquarium?
Look, I can't swim.

43:35.274 --> 43:36.976
The aquarium,
not the fish tanks.

43:37.042 --> 43:38.744
What's the difference?

43:42.047 --> 43:43.983
Okay, get your phone out.

43:44.049 --> 43:45.250
Why? You trying to
take a picture?

43:45.317 --> 43:46.585
We can use it
as a flashlight.

43:46.652 --> 43:48.120
Look, I know!
I was making a joke!

43:48.186 --> 43:49.621
Your humor is
really dry sometimes.

43:49.688 --> 43:51.623
Look, man, this better not
be leading back outside.

43:51.690 --> 43:53.759
This is gonna lead us
to the aquarium.

43:53.825 --> 43:54.826
With the sharks?

43:54.893 --> 43:55.861
Yes, with the sharks!

43:55.929 --> 43:57.696
They're in tanks!

43:59.331 --> 44:00.866
Will you hold still?

44:00.934 --> 44:02.301
Look, I'm trying!

44:05.137 --> 44:06.238
Go, go.

44:06.305 --> 44:07.606
Okay, look.

44:07.673 --> 44:10.742
All we have to do is
go down this hall

44:10.809 --> 44:12.511
and there's a staircase,
all right?

44:12.578 --> 44:14.880
So we're just gonna
move to this real fast.

44:14.948 --> 44:16.248
And then we're gonna climb up

44:16.315 --> 44:18.083
and we're gonna be
in the aquarium.

44:18.150 --> 44:19.451
In the aquarium
with the shark tanks?

44:19.518 --> 44:21.453
Yes, that are in tanks.

44:21.520 --> 44:23.221
Okay?

44:23.288 --> 44:25.357
After you.

44:27.826 --> 44:30.228
Shh!

44:30.295 --> 44:32.966
Let's just go, let's just go,
let's go, go, go, go, go.

44:33.032 --> 44:34.000
Shh!

44:36.301 --> 44:37.336
- Did you hear it?
- Yes, of course I heard it!

44:37.402 --> 44:38.837
You are freaking me out, buddy!

44:38.904 --> 44:40.272
Just keep it together!

44:40.339 --> 44:41.975
What you scared for?
You got the ax!

44:42.041 --> 44:43.141
Will you please?

44:43.208 --> 44:44.576
I'm behind you with nothing!

44:44.643 --> 44:46.211
No armor, you already
messed up my face!

44:46.278 --> 44:48.680
I am a professional!
We go at this slowly!

44:53.118 --> 44:54.353
There.

44:59.058 --> 45:01.126
And be smart out there, too.

45:01.193 --> 45:02.594
Copy that.

45:11.169 --> 45:12.738
Miranda, come look at this.

45:15.407 --> 45:17.876
This starfish has
cutaneous abrasions

45:17.944 --> 45:22.081
and tissue decay consistent
with the onset

45:22.147 --> 45:25.617
of marine epizootic
similar to SSWS.

45:28.320 --> 45:30.455
But there's nothing
to presently support

45:30.522 --> 45:32.959
any possibility
of densovirus infection.

45:33.026 --> 45:35.293
Well, I haven't noticed
any limb impairment

45:35.360 --> 45:36.828
or limited mobility.

45:36.895 --> 45:39.065
But I'm not ruling out
bacterial contamination.

45:39.132 --> 45:40.265
Yeah.

45:44.703 --> 45:45.437
Jesus!

45:45.504 --> 45:47.073
You said that was dead!

45:47.140 --> 45:50.342
You crushed its nervous system!

45:50.409 --> 45:52.711
Dead, but not dead.

45:57.449 --> 46:01.020
We're dealing with
a reanimated specimen.

46:01.087 --> 46:02.287
What?

46:04.222 --> 46:06.092
Hey, Clu? Clu?

46:06.159 --> 46:07.759
If you can hear me, stay clear.

46:07.826 --> 46:11.663
And I mean,
stay clear of any wildlife.

46:11.730 --> 46:14.299
<i>And do not touch
any of the slime.</i>

46:14.366 --> 46:16.668
No. No way am I touching
that slime.

46:16.735 --> 46:19.738
And I'm not going anywhere.
We need to find a way out.

46:19.805 --> 46:22.207
If anything pops its head up
in here that doesn't belong,

46:22.274 --> 46:23.709
it's gonna wish that it hadn't.

46:23.775 --> 46:26.244
We might be dealing
with something viral,

46:26.311 --> 46:28.714
something reanimated.

46:28.780 --> 46:31.450
<i>We've never seen
anything like this</i>

46:31.516 --> 46:33.752
and it could be contagious.

46:33.819 --> 46:36.421
And we really don't
know what's causing it.

46:36.488 --> 46:39.158
I'm gonna try to get
these cameras up and running

46:39.224 --> 46:41.160
so that can get you a
little bit more visibility.

46:41.226 --> 46:42.995
<i>I don't like you all
running around blindly</i>

46:43.062 --> 46:44.830
<i>without knowing
what's around the corner.</i>

46:44.896 --> 46:47.066
<i>Especially because
we're not exactly sure</i>

46:47.133 --> 46:48.667
<i>what we're up against.</i>

46:48.734 --> 46:51.070
Thank you, Clu.
We'll keep moving.

46:51.137 --> 46:53.172
I'll check back with you later.

46:53.238 --> 46:54.740
Copy that.

46:57.242 --> 46:58.410
Let's see what we got.

47:00.113 --> 47:02.514
Come on.
Give me something!

47:06.618 --> 47:09.921
Okay, I'm gonna get
you guys out of here,

47:09.989 --> 47:11.057
but I need to find a map.

47:11.124 --> 47:12.357
Come help me find one.

47:14.926 --> 47:17.130
Yes...

47:17.196 --> 47:18.396
No.

47:19.364 --> 47:21.366
Oh, I found some!

47:21.433 --> 47:23.902
Okay, there's gotta be
another way

47:23.970 --> 47:26.538
that I haven't thought of to get
out of here or crawl out of.

47:29.976 --> 47:32.677
I didn't realize
how huge this place was.

47:32.744 --> 47:34.813
Hey man, are you
feeling all right?

47:36.082 --> 47:38.050
Yes, I just need to...

47:38.117 --> 47:40.318
sit down for a moment.

47:44.823 --> 47:47.026
Oh... oh, yeah.

47:53.266 --> 47:54.934
What are you smiling at?

47:56.135 --> 47:58.336
Oh, I don't feel so good.

47:58.403 --> 47:59.838
Hey! Focus!

47:59.905 --> 48:01.573
I really feel like
I'm gonna pass out.

48:01.640 --> 48:03.109
Hey, you lost
a lot of blood, man.

48:03.176 --> 48:04.376
Oh...

48:04.442 --> 48:05.544
Hey, hey, hey!
Stay with me now.

48:05.610 --> 48:07.180
Hey, I'll be right back.

48:07.246 --> 48:08.613
Okay.

48:09.514 --> 48:10.715
Where'd he go?

48:15.854 --> 48:17.856
Hey. Here.
You gotta drink this.

48:22.427 --> 48:23.963
Drink, you got to drink it!

48:34.606 --> 48:37.576
You... You saved
my life back there.

48:37.642 --> 48:39.811
Yeah. Don't mention it.
I gotta bandage you up.

48:46.152 --> 48:48.653
Hey, hey.

48:48.720 --> 48:51.523
Thank you for not
leaving me behind, man.

48:51.590 --> 48:52.992
You're a tour guide.

48:53.059 --> 48:54.359
How else am I gonna
get out of this place?

48:55.094 --> 48:56.394
Hey, I just remembered!

48:56.461 --> 48:57.930
What?

48:57.997 --> 48:59.364
There's another door
hidden from the public.

48:59.431 --> 49:01.499
Seriously?
Is that one locked, too?

49:01.566 --> 49:02.567
Go find out.

49:02.634 --> 49:04.136
You wanna show me?

49:04.203 --> 49:06.404
No. I want to wait for the crabs
to come back, of course.

49:08.573 --> 49:10.176
Jacked up my knee.

49:10.243 --> 49:12.811
You're a tough guy.
You can shake it off.

49:12.878 --> 49:15.047
Ah!

49:15.114 --> 49:16.048
Gimme that.

49:16.115 --> 49:17.682
For what?

49:17.749 --> 49:19.517
I'm still the tour guide.

49:29.996 --> 49:33.865
Yeah, Dispatch.
No hot spots, no people.

49:33.933 --> 49:35.767
Place is empty.

49:35.834 --> 49:37.502
There's another
outage at the aquarium.

49:37.569 --> 49:41.007
Something's gotta
be going on.

49:41.073 --> 49:42.174
10-4. Copy that.

49:43.109 --> 49:44.243
You hear that?

49:44.310 --> 49:45.311
- What?
- Shh!

49:45.378 --> 49:46.312
You wanna feed the sharks?

49:46.379 --> 49:48.381
Shh!

49:49.348 --> 49:50.515
- Oh!
- What?

49:50.582 --> 49:52.484
That's a crocodile!

49:52.550 --> 49:54.619
Dispatch! We got people
running around in there!

49:54.686 --> 49:56.922
Animals are loose!
We gotta get them out!

49:56.989 --> 50:00.259
No. Stay where you are.
Wait for Animal Control. Copy?

50:00.326 --> 50:01.626
Negative! No!

50:01.693 --> 50:03.396
We need to get them
out right now!

50:03.461 --> 50:05.463
We have a citywide grid outage.

50:05.530 --> 50:07.967
- How long?
- 60 minutes.

50:08.034 --> 50:10.403
With any luck,
we can get there in 45.

50:10.468 --> 50:11.903
We've gotta find a way in there!

50:13.605 --> 50:15.942
This is not how I planned
to spend my birthday.

50:16.008 --> 50:18.010
You should have
gotten a girlfriend.

50:18.077 --> 50:20.645
Well, maybe I thought the tour
guide was gonna be a girl.

50:20.712 --> 50:23.082
Says the guy named Skylar.

50:23.149 --> 50:24.083
You know what...

50:25.684 --> 50:27.053
What was that?

50:33.359 --> 50:35.593
Ah!

50:45.438 --> 50:50.376
Okay, so the sea lion habitat
is both indoor and outdoor.

50:50.443 --> 50:55.247
There is a chute that we can go
down and kind of glob back up.

50:55.314 --> 50:56.415
It's about 15 feet.

50:56.481 --> 50:58.650
So then we climb out?

50:58.717 --> 51:01.786
Well, the only problem
is that sea lion habitat

51:01.853 --> 51:03.555
is in Quadrant One.

51:03.621 --> 51:06.993
We are in Quadrant Two

51:07.059 --> 51:10.695
and the fire doors
are shut very tight.

51:12.465 --> 51:15.434
So if we can figure out a way
to get through the quadrant,

51:15.500 --> 51:17.403
we can get out.

51:17.470 --> 51:20.505
So is that it?
Is that our plan?

51:20.572 --> 51:21.706
That's the plan.

51:23.742 --> 51:27.712
But we can't let any of these
animals get out to the public.

51:27.779 --> 51:30.116
We can't even imagine the damage

51:30.182 --> 51:33.219
and destruction that
would occur as a result.

51:33.285 --> 51:34.487
Well, we can barricade them.

51:34.552 --> 51:36.155
We can wedge it
from the outside.

51:36.222 --> 51:39.758
I just hope the octopus
doesn't get the same idea.

51:39.824 --> 51:42.028
It's already killed two people

51:42.094 --> 51:44.230
and it's probably still
on the move in the ducts.

51:45.630 --> 51:47.099
Wait.

51:47.166 --> 51:49.301
Does the octopus still
have the telemetry tag?

51:49.368 --> 51:51.736
Is it still in there?
Is it still active?

51:51.803 --> 51:53.872
We never had a chance
to bring it online.

51:53.939 --> 51:57.675
But I could log on to the
network and initiate the signal.

51:57.742 --> 51:59.245
Okay, yes.

51:59.311 --> 52:01.981
Oh, damn it!
I don't have my phone.

52:02.048 --> 52:04.649
That's the only way to track it.

52:04.716 --> 52:07.953
Everything else is down.

52:08.020 --> 52:08.920
Okay.

52:08.988 --> 52:11.490
So we'll go get your phone.

52:11.556 --> 52:14.994
We'll call 911, we'll turn
on and activate the tag.

52:15.061 --> 52:16.761
And we'll make sure that
it's not going anywhere.

52:16.828 --> 52:18.964
And then we will get to
the sea lion habitat.

52:19.031 --> 52:22.001
We have to hurry or we'll
be doing this in the dark.

52:22.068 --> 52:24.103
The only reason some of
the lights are still on

52:24.170 --> 52:26.738
is because of our
backup generators.

52:26.805 --> 52:29.041
But who knows how long
that will last.

52:29.108 --> 52:31.444
Okay?

52:31.510 --> 52:32.710
That's the plan.

52:53.466 --> 52:54.967
Okay?

52:55.034 --> 52:55.834
Now what?

52:55.900 --> 52:57.169
Well, we have two options.

52:57.236 --> 53:00.940
We can either go this way
or that way.

53:01.006 --> 53:04.143
And that way is flooded, so...

53:04.210 --> 53:06.545
So that's not an option,
so we're going this way.

53:06.611 --> 53:08.013
Great.

53:10.216 --> 53:11.083
I have an idea.

53:11.150 --> 53:13.085
I have an idea, I have an idea.

53:17.356 --> 53:18.857
This is the Educational Lab.

53:18.923 --> 53:20.792
It's been under construction
for a few weeks.

53:20.859 --> 53:22.861
There's been flooding
in here, too.

53:34.340 --> 53:36.041
You weren't kidding.

53:36.108 --> 53:37.576
No.

53:37.642 --> 53:40.479
We have to crawl through the
ceiling to get to the fire door.

53:40.546 --> 53:44.116
It's the only way we'll get
to the sea lion habitat.

53:44.183 --> 53:46.519
Okay.
There you go.

53:46.585 --> 53:47.685
I got it.

53:47.752 --> 53:49.821
Thank you.

53:49.888 --> 53:52.391
Okay, so you guys
need to go first.

53:52.458 --> 53:54.826
And then Dr. James and
I will follow behind you.

53:57.563 --> 53:59.031
Okay.

54:01.133 --> 54:02.067
Careful, Bailey.

54:06.372 --> 54:09.408
So how far are
we supposed to go?

54:09.475 --> 54:12.777
The Marine Science Gallery, it's
got a different color carpet.

54:12.844 --> 54:13.946
So when you
look down through the panel,

54:14.013 --> 54:15.281
you'll be able to see that.

54:15.347 --> 54:19.185
And then just
drop down in there.

54:19.251 --> 54:21.086
Okay.

54:21.153 --> 54:22.854
Different color carpet.
Got it.

54:26.292 --> 54:29.094
Uh, I don't know
about this...

54:29.161 --> 54:30.862
Okay, well,
unfortunately,

54:30.930 --> 54:32.164
it's the only
option that we have, okay?

54:32.231 --> 54:32.965
Mm-hm.

54:33.032 --> 54:34.333
Just give me your hand.

54:34.400 --> 54:35.833
Okay, okay, okay. Okay.

54:35.900 --> 54:36.969
Do you want me
to hold your binder?

54:37.036 --> 54:38.237
Oh, no, no.
I have this.

54:38.304 --> 54:39.104
Okay.

54:39.171 --> 54:41.307
Okay, Karen, let's go.

54:41.373 --> 54:42.408
Okay.

54:51.083 --> 54:55.321
I cannot believe you
lost our phones!

54:55.387 --> 54:57.089
I don't like this.

54:57.156 --> 54:58.723
I don't like this at all.

54:58.790 --> 55:00.960
Oh, God.
Oh, I want to get down.

55:01.026 --> 55:03.429
I really...
Okay, I've got to get down.

55:03.495 --> 55:07.533
Beth, it's okay.
It's gonna be okay.

55:07.600 --> 55:09.034
Just look for another vent.

55:13.905 --> 55:15.407
Are you guys okay?

55:15.474 --> 55:17.276
Where's Dr. James?

55:17.343 --> 55:20.079
She took a different route.
She's gonna meet us there.

55:20.145 --> 55:21.013
What?

55:21.080 --> 55:22.248
She's gonna meet us there!

55:22.314 --> 55:23.415
Oh, my God.

55:23.482 --> 55:24.416
Just keep going.

55:24.483 --> 55:25.684
Okay.

55:25.750 --> 55:27.353
Just a little bit
more to the left.

55:27.419 --> 55:29.955
This is insane.

55:30.022 --> 55:32.324
I cancelled a 12 PM lunch
for this.

55:32.391 --> 55:34.526
Actually sir, they had
already cancelled last week.

55:34.593 --> 55:35.860
I just felt like you needed
something that was

55:35.927 --> 55:38.830
giving back to the community.

55:38.896 --> 55:42.134
We do appreciate your support.

55:42.201 --> 55:45.971
Beth, remind me to fire you
when we get out of this mess.

55:56.848 --> 55:58.183
Okay, come on.

55:58.250 --> 55:59.685
It's safe down here.
I went.

55:59.752 --> 56:01.387
Oh! Okay.

56:02.154 --> 56:03.722
Okay, is anything down there?

56:03.788 --> 56:05.024
- No! You're fine.
- Are you sure?

56:05.090 --> 56:06.091
- You're fine.
- Okay.

56:06.158 --> 56:10.862
Come on.

56:10.929 --> 56:12.131
Take this.
Stand right here.

56:12.197 --> 56:13.532
Careful.

56:13.599 --> 56:14.767
Got it?

56:14.832 --> 56:16.535
I guess you got it.

56:16.602 --> 56:17.970
All right.
This way.

56:22.074 --> 56:24.310
What is that?

56:24.376 --> 56:26.911
Crabs! Run!

56:27.780 --> 56:29.748
Oh!

56:29.814 --> 56:30.683
- Sorry.
- Crabs!

56:30.749 --> 56:33.885
Crabs, crabs!

56:33.952 --> 56:35.254
You're alive!

56:37.489 --> 56:39.091
Ah!

56:56.442 --> 56:57.909
Crab legs, anyone?

57:00.012 --> 57:01.714
Uh, we're not far
from the Veterinary.

57:01.780 --> 57:03.982
I can go get my phone.

57:04.049 --> 57:05.184
I'll go with you.

57:05.250 --> 57:07.252
Wait, wait, wait!
Be careful!

57:07.319 --> 57:08.587
There was a crocodile
coming after us!

57:08.654 --> 57:10.255
We have no idea where he is.

57:14.326 --> 57:16.061
We should probably go with them.

57:16.128 --> 57:17.396
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

57:26.305 --> 57:28.340
Oh my God!

57:28.407 --> 57:29.541
Joe!

57:32.111 --> 57:33.445
No. He's gone.

57:33.512 --> 57:34.879
Oh my God.

57:39.251 --> 57:42.621
This is just like the syringe
I used on the octopus!

57:44.123 --> 57:46.959
Whatever is in there needs
to be out of the lab

57:47.025 --> 57:48.627
into quarantine to study.

57:51.663 --> 57:54.299
Oh, my God, E.Z.

57:54.366 --> 57:56.235
Eden Zoo!

57:57.269 --> 57:59.171
I thought that was destroyed.

57:59.238 --> 58:01.507
There was a disposal order.

58:03.041 --> 58:05.177
Daniel told me he burned them.

58:11.483 --> 58:13.918
That theory is totally
wacked, Miranda.

58:13.986 --> 58:16.221
There has to be a
normal, logical,

58:16.288 --> 58:18.457
scientific reason
why this happened.

58:18.524 --> 58:21.326
Then why did Dr. Rogers tell us
to get rid of the injectors?

58:21.393 --> 58:23.195
Bad lots happen all the time.

58:23.262 --> 58:24.696
And I told you
I got rid of them.

58:24.763 --> 58:26.665
I don't know.
Maybe Logistics screwed up

58:26.732 --> 58:28.600
and one of them mixed in
with the stable lot.

58:28.667 --> 58:31.170
My phone, the signal
isn't coming through.

58:31.236 --> 58:34.306
I mean, I can't even
open the app

58:34.373 --> 58:36.508
to register the telemetry tag
on the octopus.

58:36.575 --> 58:38.577
It may be this
fiberglass insulation.

58:38.644 --> 58:40.212
We get dead spots all the time
at the hospital.

58:40.279 --> 58:43.248
Happens a lot in
these older buildings.

58:43.315 --> 58:47.152
Okay, well, we just need
to keep moving, okay?

58:47.219 --> 58:49.221
I need to talk to you right now.

58:50.589 --> 58:53.358
You told me that you
burned the Eden supply.

58:53.425 --> 58:54.927
You told me you destroyed it.

58:54.993 --> 58:57.062
I did. I had it arranged
and everything.

58:57.129 --> 59:00.332
So how do you explain
these syringes?

59:02.868 --> 59:04.203
I don't know, Miranda.

59:04.269 --> 59:05.637
I did my job, though.

59:05.704 --> 59:07.272
There's a disposal order
in the office.

59:07.339 --> 59:08.307
You want me to risk my life
and go there

59:08.373 --> 59:09.508
and bring it back for you?

59:09.575 --> 59:10.944
No.

59:11.009 --> 59:13.412
After this is all over,
I will find out what happened.

59:13.479 --> 59:16.048
So if you want to talk to me
about anything that you know,

59:16.114 --> 59:18.450
you tell me right now.

59:18.517 --> 59:22.454
I'm telling you
I don't know anything.

59:27.793 --> 59:29.561
This is an aquarium!

59:29.628 --> 59:31.630
What if one of the animals got
loose 'cause a tank got busted?

59:31.697 --> 59:34.600
It would kill the phone lines.
It'd kill the power.

59:34.666 --> 59:35.935
Hell, it even triggered
the alarm

59:36.001 --> 59:37.169
without a fire being around!

59:37.236 --> 59:38.337
How many gallons
are in this place?

59:38.403 --> 59:39.872
Hundreds of thousands.

59:39.939 --> 59:41.907
If just one of those tanks
sprung a small leak,

59:41.975 --> 59:44.409
they could be up
to their knees in it!

59:44.476 --> 59:46.578
Forget that! Come on!
Let's take the stairs!

59:46.645 --> 59:47.613
Forget the stairs!

59:51.250 --> 59:52.384
I got this!

59:56.288 --> 59:57.656
Hey! I got it!

59:59.758 --> 1:00:01.260
Hey!

1:00:17.376 --> 1:00:18.377
Oh!

1:00:18.443 --> 1:00:20.245
Oh, shit!

1:00:32.424 --> 1:00:33.659
Ah!

1:00:37.663 --> 1:00:39.364
Ah!

1:00:39.431 --> 1:00:40.365
Oh, sh...

1:00:43.201 --> 1:00:45.137
Oh, my God!

1:00:45.203 --> 1:00:47.306
Oh my God!
Are you okay?

1:00:47.372 --> 1:00:48.307
What was that thing?

1:00:48.373 --> 1:00:49.708
I don't know.

1:00:49.775 --> 1:00:51.176
Next time, I'm taking
the stairs.

1:00:58.917 --> 1:00:59.851
Come on.

1:01:08.627 --> 1:01:10.095
Almost there...

1:01:20.372 --> 1:01:23.076
What in the hell
were you thinking?

1:01:23.141 --> 1:01:24.409
Rigging that tank to break

1:01:24.476 --> 1:01:25.911
while Beth and I
were in the premises?

1:01:25.979 --> 1:01:27.112
What's gotten into you?

1:01:27.179 --> 1:01:28.113
It wasn't me!

1:01:28.180 --> 1:01:30.182
What do you mean?

1:01:30.248 --> 1:01:32.384
I only lied about burning
the bad doses

1:01:32.451 --> 1:01:33.987
to sabotage the
Veterinary clinic.

1:01:34.053 --> 1:01:36.321
I was waiting to rig the tank
until you two left.

1:01:36.388 --> 1:01:37.723
I'm not an idiot!

1:01:39.625 --> 1:01:41.660
Uh, Daniel.

1:01:43.096 --> 1:01:44.129
Is that what I think it is?

1:01:44.196 --> 1:01:45.864
Oh, my God.

1:01:49.568 --> 1:01:52.038
Okay, we can just
turn back and...

1:01:52.105 --> 1:01:54.873
- Oh!
- Oh, shit.

1:01:58.210 --> 1:02:00.579
Now what?

1:02:03.682 --> 1:02:05.217
I think they're communicating!

1:02:05.283 --> 1:02:07.319
Yeah, but it's different.

1:02:07.386 --> 1:02:09.921
It's new, it's louder
and more urgent.

1:02:09.989 --> 1:02:12.624
It's a strange signal.

1:02:12.691 --> 1:02:14.626
It's like they
can't see each other,

1:02:14.693 --> 1:02:16.328
like they're blind or something.

1:02:16.395 --> 1:02:18.864
No. Not today, not today!
I'm not dying today!

1:02:20.099 --> 1:02:22.434
- Skylar!
- Skylar, no, no, no!

1:02:23.936 --> 1:02:26.271
Skylar, no!

1:02:27.639 --> 1:02:28.907
Ah!

1:02:40.153 --> 1:02:44.256
Ooh, look at all this!

1:02:48.260 --> 1:02:50.328
Miranda?

1:02:50.395 --> 1:02:52.197
Come back.
Checking in.

1:02:52.264 --> 1:02:55.267
How's everyone doing out there?

1:02:55.333 --> 1:02:58.637
Miranda?
Come in!

1:02:58.704 --> 1:02:59.838
Miranda!

1:03:07.579 --> 1:03:09.949
Everyone, stay completely quiet.

1:03:29.601 --> 1:03:32.071
Oh, God.
That was close.

1:03:38.310 --> 1:03:40.779
Everybody, quick. Hide!

1:03:40.846 --> 1:03:42.380
Stay out of its path
and stay quiet.

1:03:42.447 --> 1:03:43.815
What are you gonna do, Karen?

1:03:43.882 --> 1:03:46.085
Just shut up and go.
Everybody go. Go.

1:03:46.152 --> 1:03:48.353
No, Karen! No!

1:03:50.223 --> 1:03:53.658
Come on, work! Record!

1:03:53.725 --> 1:03:57.329
Species showing evidence
of complete blindness,

1:03:57.395 --> 1:03:59.831
eyes milky white.

1:03:59.898 --> 1:04:03.635
Exhibiting behaviors consistent
with complete loss of vision

1:04:03.702 --> 1:04:06.005
through form of improvised
communication

1:04:06.072 --> 1:04:07.506
with one another.

1:04:07.572 --> 1:04:11.543
Hunting patterns dependent
solely

1:04:11.610 --> 1:04:14.846
on locating its prey
through sound!

1:04:14.913 --> 1:04:18.151

1:04:18.217 --> 1:04:22.621
<i>Exhibiting behaviors consistent
with total loss of vision</i>

1:04:22.687 --> 1:04:25.924
<i>through form of improvised
communication with one another.</i>

1:04:25.992 --> 1:04:30.529
<i>Hunting patterns

1:04:30.595 --> 1:04:33.465
<i>upon locating their
prey through sound!"</i>

1:04:35.234 --> 1:04:37.937
<i>...of complete blindness,
eyes milky white.</i>

1:04:38.004 --> 1:04:42.440
<i>Exhibiting behaviors consistent

1:04:42.507 --> 1:04:44.309
<i>through form of imp...</i>

1:04:48.446 --> 1:04:49.447
A door.

1:04:49.514 --> 1:04:51.316
Come on, come on, come on!

1:04:56.721 --> 1:04:57.856
Damn it!

1:04:57.923 --> 1:04:58.857
It's locked!

1:05:01.294 --> 1:05:04.030
Miranda?
You there?

1:05:04.096 --> 1:05:05.164
Go ahead, Clu.

1:05:05.231 --> 1:05:07.033
The desk is back online.

1:05:07.099 --> 1:05:08.767
I've got some cameras
up as well.

1:05:08.834 --> 1:05:12.238
So it's a good news
and bad news situation.

1:05:12.305 --> 1:05:13.839
What news do you want first?

1:05:13.905 --> 1:05:17.009
I think we could all use
a little good news right now.

1:05:17.076 --> 1:05:18.476
Okay, good news it is.

1:05:18.543 --> 1:05:21.346
The desk is allowing me
to override the lockdown

1:05:21.413 --> 1:05:23.782
and I've released
some of the exits.

1:05:23.849 --> 1:05:25.084
And the bad?

1:05:25.151 --> 1:05:27.419
And the bad news is

1:05:27.485 --> 1:05:29.921
the failsafe locking
mechanisms are electronic

1:05:29.989 --> 1:05:32.691
and absolutely none
of them are responding.

1:05:32.757 --> 1:05:35.660
So nothing or no
one is getting out of here

1:05:35.727 --> 1:05:38.097
unless those locks are powered.

1:05:38.164 --> 1:05:40.432
Now I can override
those locks all day long.

1:05:40.498 --> 1:05:43.135
But if there ain't no juice
getting to those electronics,

1:05:43.202 --> 1:05:45.403
we are stuck like chuck.

1:05:45.470 --> 1:05:46.771
Copy.

1:05:46.838 --> 1:05:48.307
So all the doors are
still locked.

1:05:48.373 --> 1:05:50.408
How is she working
on the console

1:05:50.475 --> 1:05:51.978
if this whole place
is out of power?

1:05:52.044 --> 1:05:54.579
Because the console
has a backup battery.

1:05:54.646 --> 1:05:57.283
It was the last thing
to get upgraded six years ago.

1:05:57.350 --> 1:05:59.885
<i>Everything is under water
in this place.</i>

1:05:59.952 --> 1:06:02.787
I've tried to reroute the power
to the alternate generator.

1:06:02.854 --> 1:06:05.057
But it just won't cycle over.

1:06:06.925 --> 1:06:08.894
It needs to
be switched on manually?

1:06:08.961 --> 1:06:11.429
Yeah. If we don't do that,
then we're not gonna get out.

1:06:11.496 --> 1:06:13.598
Hey, Clu.
We're in the sea lion habitat.

1:06:13.665 --> 1:06:15.567
Good. Then you're not far
from the breaker box,

1:06:15.634 --> 1:06:17.702
but it's located
in the basement.

1:06:17.769 --> 1:06:18.737
Copy?

1:06:18.803 --> 1:06:19.838
Copy.

1:06:19.905 --> 1:06:21.073
The basement?

1:06:21.140 --> 1:06:22.574
Does she even know
what we went through to

1:06:22.641 --> 1:06:24.010
get from the fire door to here?

1:06:24.076 --> 1:06:26.145
Who cares?
We know where we're going.

1:06:26.212 --> 1:06:27.712
Let's get there.

1:06:27.779 --> 1:06:28.847
Okay.

1:06:28.914 --> 1:06:30.216
The only way through
is the basement

1:06:30.283 --> 1:06:31.816
and it's right by the stairs.

1:06:31.883 --> 1:06:35.087
But we have to go through
the next exhibit next to us.

1:06:37.156 --> 1:06:38.090
Super.

1:06:39.925 --> 1:06:41.127
Why?

1:06:41.193 --> 1:06:44.562
Because all the doors
are still locked! Jesus!

1:06:44.629 --> 1:06:45.864
So wait, wait.

1:06:45.932 --> 1:06:47.632
What exhibit are
we talking about?

1:06:50.303 --> 1:06:51.603
Shark Cove.

1:06:53.372 --> 1:06:54.806
You gotta be kidding.

1:07:02.447 --> 1:07:03.848
- Come on, stay close.
- Oh, Jesus.

1:07:12.490 --> 1:07:14.693
- Oh, shit.
- Everyone hide!

1:07:37.450 --> 1:07:38.985
It's clear.

1:07:39.051 --> 1:07:40.852
Let's go.

1:07:40.919 --> 1:07:41.519
Come on.

1:07:41.586 --> 1:07:43.588
Whoa!

1:07:44.991 --> 1:07:45.992
Shh!

1:07:47.592 --> 1:07:50.196
Are they dead?

1:07:50.262 --> 1:07:54.066
They're not moving, but they
are definitely not dead.

1:07:54.133 --> 1:07:55.867
This is the only way out.

1:07:55.935 --> 1:07:59.205
Okay, these...
These are Macos.

1:07:59.271 --> 1:08:01.040
There's only two of them.

1:08:02.441 --> 1:08:03.742
Where are the others?

1:08:05.945 --> 1:08:08.747
What do you mean, the rest?

1:08:08.813 --> 1:08:10.682
Hey, Miranda, there's the
stairwell

1:08:10.749 --> 1:08:11.816
on the other end of the Gallery.

1:08:11.883 --> 1:08:13.319
Maybe we go back that way.

1:08:13.386 --> 1:08:15.154
Fuck this.

1:08:15.221 --> 1:08:18.857
I am going through to the other
side with or without you guys.

1:08:18.923 --> 1:08:21.193
And then I'm having
this place condemned!

1:08:21.260 --> 1:08:22.660
Wait. What?

1:08:22.727 --> 1:08:24.230
I am getting to the other side
of this exhibit.

1:08:24.296 --> 1:08:28.267
I am faster on my feet than
they are out of the water,

1:08:28.334 --> 1:08:29.402
I'll tell you that.

1:08:29.468 --> 1:08:30.769
No, you can't just do that.

1:08:30.835 --> 1:08:32.104
You can't just march
over there

1:08:32.171 --> 1:08:33.638
and expect everything
to go well.

1:08:33.705 --> 1:08:37.276
Okay, we should go
one by one, okay?

1:08:37.343 --> 1:08:40.179
Okay, I'll go first.

1:08:42.415 --> 1:08:43.915
Make sure it's safe.

1:08:43.983 --> 1:08:45.317
Okay.

1:08:49.921 --> 1:08:50.855
Oh, da...

1:08:55.560 --> 1:08:57.029
Ooh!

1:09:02.268 --> 1:09:03.269
Okay.

1:09:11.609 --> 1:09:12.911
Oh.

1:09:12.978 --> 1:09:15.847
Okay, come on, guys.
Come on, guys.

1:09:15.914 --> 1:09:17.882
Do I have a fever?

1:09:17.950 --> 1:09:19.751
Are you okay?
Are you sick?

1:09:19.818 --> 1:09:24.023
I'm feeling really, really cold.

1:09:24.090 --> 1:09:25.657
Feels like you're burning up.

1:09:25.723 --> 1:09:26.992
She's burning up.

1:09:27.059 --> 1:09:29.594
- All right, watch me.
- Okay.

1:09:29.661 --> 1:09:31.297
Watch me do it.

1:09:37.602 --> 1:09:39.038
Oh my... oh!

1:09:40.439 --> 1:09:41.873
Okay, good job.

1:09:48.713 --> 1:09:50.516
Okay, come on back, come on.

1:09:50.583 --> 1:09:52.318
No.

1:09:52.384 --> 1:09:55.187
You gotta go.
But you gotta go now.

1:09:55.254 --> 1:09:56.754
- Come on!
- I can't, I can't.

1:09:56.821 --> 1:09:58.424
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

1:09:58.491 --> 1:10:00.625
- You guys, I can't, I'm sorry.
- Yes, you can.

1:10:00.692 --> 1:10:01.994
Look in my eyes.
Look in my eyes.

1:10:02.061 --> 1:10:03.795
Follow the leader, okay?
We can do this.

1:10:03.862 --> 1:10:05.264
Follow the leader.

1:10:05.331 --> 1:10:06.966
Come on.
Come on over.

1:10:07.032 --> 1:10:09.368
Follow the leader.
Follow the leader.

1:10:15.541 --> 1:10:17.543
There you go.
There you go.

1:10:17.610 --> 1:10:19.811
See? See?
You did it, you did it.

1:10:19.878 --> 1:10:21.746
Okay, one more.

1:10:21.813 --> 1:10:23.115
One more to go.

1:10:28.521 --> 1:10:30.422
Come on, come on.
There you go.

1:10:33.791 --> 1:10:35.427
There. There you go.
There you go.

1:10:35.494 --> 1:10:36.395
Okay, come on, Karen.

1:10:36.462 --> 1:10:37.762
Your turn.

1:10:37.829 --> 1:10:39.064
- Oh, I don't know.
- You got it.

1:10:39.131 --> 1:10:39.864
Come on.

1:10:39.932 --> 1:10:42.501
I gotta get out of here.

1:10:42.568 --> 1:10:44.303
Okay, okay.

1:10:50.842 --> 1:10:51.709
Yes, yes, okay!

1:10:51.776 --> 1:10:53.546
Oh, my God!

1:10:53.612 --> 1:10:56.081
Just one more.
Just one more.

1:10:56.148 --> 1:10:58.184
- You can do it, come on!
- You got it.

1:11:02.921 --> 1:11:04.123
Behind you!

1:11:04.190 --> 1:11:06.724
The other shark, it's moving!

1:11:06.791 --> 1:11:08.693
Watch out!

1:11:09.562 --> 1:11:11.796
Ah!

1:11:11.863 --> 1:11:13.365
- Move!
- Jesus!

1:11:13.432 --> 1:11:14.466
Help me!

1:11:16.868 --> 1:11:19.804
Go, go, go!
Run, run!

1:11:44.063 --> 1:11:46.365
Give me your tie!
Give me your tie!

1:11:51.003 --> 1:11:52.404
It's okay, I got you.

1:11:52.471 --> 1:11:55.074
- Hold on, hold on.
- Okay, okay, okay.

1:11:55.140 --> 1:11:57.610
There you go.
Can you walk?

1:11:57.676 --> 1:12:00.845
I'm not gonna let you leave me
behind, that's for damn sure.

1:12:00.912 --> 1:12:01.813
Okay, good.

1:12:01.879 --> 1:12:03.415
Whoa! Whoa!

1:12:03.482 --> 1:12:04.583
You okay?

1:12:04.650 --> 1:12:05.917
Yeah, thank you.

1:12:09.722 --> 1:12:12.091
I'm so cold, I'm so cold.

1:12:12.157 --> 1:12:13.791
Oh, my gosh, she's burning up.

1:12:13.858 --> 1:12:15.194
Are you okay?

1:12:15.261 --> 1:12:16.794
Can you help me?

1:12:16.861 --> 1:12:20.399
I didn't want to say anything
as we had to go and move...

1:12:26.305 --> 1:12:28.307
Oh, my God!

1:12:28.374 --> 1:12:31.909
We need to get that
thing off of her now!

1:12:31.977 --> 1:12:34.546
- Get her back.
- I got you. I got you.

1:12:34.613 --> 1:12:35.981
Okay, thank you.

1:12:36.048 --> 1:12:37.449
- We got you.
- Thank you.

1:12:37.516 --> 1:12:39.551
Oh, my God, it's
drinking her blood source.

1:12:39.618 --> 1:12:41.620
Ow!

1:12:41.687 --> 1:12:42.955
- Okay.
- Beth, stay with us.

1:12:43.022 --> 1:12:45.257
- Okay.
- Stay with me.

1:12:45.324 --> 1:12:47.326
Look at me.

1:12:47.393 --> 1:12:48.460
Hey, hey, hey.

1:12:48.527 --> 1:12:51.063
Beth, stay with us!
Stay with us!

1:12:51.130 --> 1:12:52.531
Look at me!
Beth, look at me.

1:12:52.598 --> 1:12:54.133
It's in there so deep!

1:12:58.537 --> 1:12:59.972
Guys?

1:13:00.039 --> 1:13:01.674
Guys, I don't think
she's breathing.

1:13:01.740 --> 1:13:04.209
- Oh, no.
- No, no, no, no.

1:13:04.276 --> 1:13:05.277
No.

1:13:08.080 --> 1:13:09.648
- Beth, no, no, no.
- She's not breathing.

1:13:09.715 --> 1:13:11.483
Beth, no!
I can get this off!

1:13:11.550 --> 1:13:14.386
- I can get it off!
- I'm not getting a pulse!

1:13:14.453 --> 1:13:16.921
Miranda, we lost her.

1:13:18.123 --> 1:13:19.792
No, no, no,
no, no, no, Beth.

1:13:19.857 --> 1:13:21.360
No, no, no, no!

1:13:21.427 --> 1:13:23.662
I can do this!

1:13:23.729 --> 1:13:25.197
I can get it out!
I can get it out!

1:13:25.264 --> 1:13:27.566
Miranda, she's gone.

1:13:33.305 --> 1:13:35.840
There was no saving her
at this point.

1:13:37.209 --> 1:13:40.446
That thing has been
feeding off of her

1:13:40.512 --> 1:13:43.182
even with the central nervous
system destroyed.

1:13:43.248 --> 1:13:45.484
It still managed
to get sustenance.

1:13:45.551 --> 1:13:48.554
Who knows how long that
thing's been stuck there?

1:13:53.925 --> 1:13:55.627
Did you know about this?

1:13:55.694 --> 1:13:58.430
No. She didn't say anything.

1:14:04.303 --> 1:14:05.971
We gotta keep moving.
Let's go!

1:14:10.676 --> 1:14:12.544
No, no!

1:14:17.882 --> 1:14:21.220
Jack, you don't understand!
This thing was at least 15 feet!

1:14:21.286 --> 1:14:23.122
We don't have the resources
to bag something like this!

1:14:23.188 --> 1:14:24.623
That's why we call you guys in!

1:14:24.690 --> 1:14:26.792
Well, I've got to tie
this up, first.

1:14:26.859 --> 1:14:29.528
Yeah, you do that and, as soon
as you're done, you get here!

1:14:29.595 --> 1:14:32.064
I will! You just have no idea
how bad it is

1:14:32.131 --> 1:14:34.333
at Eden zoo right now.

1:14:34.400 --> 1:14:37.836
We can't get in.
It's electrified.

1:14:37.902 --> 1:14:39.204
What'd he say?

1:14:39.271 --> 1:14:40.873
Homicide says they got
two dead bodies

1:14:40.939 --> 1:14:42.508
in what they're calling an
extreme hoarding situation.

1:14:42.574 --> 1:14:43.842
What?

1:14:43.908 --> 1:14:45.611
They got about 30 cats
and 12 dogs.

1:14:45.677 --> 1:14:47.246
They need to get out of there
before CSI can even move in.

1:14:47.312 --> 1:14:49.148
Something about
the Eden Zoo Sanctuary.

1:14:49.214 --> 1:14:50.783
Call the Sheriff's Department!

1:14:50.849 --> 1:14:52.618
We can't do that!
They don't deal with animals!

1:14:52.684 --> 1:14:54.453
Can we call the Animal Control
next county over?

1:14:54.520 --> 1:14:55.854
No, no, no.
They'll take too long.

1:14:55.920 --> 1:14:57.423
We gotta get them out of here!

1:14:57.489 --> 1:14:58.624
Let's go!

1:14:58.690 --> 1:15:00.259
- Let's check it out.
- All right.

1:15:02.728 --> 1:15:03.996
Where is it?

1:15:04.062 --> 1:15:06.098
Where's the breaker box?

1:15:06.165 --> 1:15:07.633
It's flooded!

1:15:07.699 --> 1:15:09.568
I think the breaker box
is over there, right?

1:15:09.635 --> 1:15:11.170
We're never gonna
get out of here.

1:15:11.236 --> 1:15:14.273
I have an idea!
Daniel, come with me.

1:15:19.178 --> 1:15:20.979
The generator's
over there.

1:15:23.449 --> 1:15:25.584
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna go get it.

1:15:25.651 --> 1:15:26.885
You're gonna what?

1:15:26.985 --> 1:15:30.022
Gonna go turn it on.

1:15:30.088 --> 1:15:31.423
Be careful.

1:15:37.596 --> 1:15:38.730
Almost there...

1:15:45.504 --> 1:15:47.039
Careful!

1:15:49.741 --> 1:15:50.809
No! No!

1:15:50.876 --> 1:15:53.011
Oh!

1:15:55.180 --> 1:15:56.482
Get off me!

1:16:01.453 --> 1:16:02.488
Clu!

1:16:02.554 --> 1:16:06.458
Deep-fried calamari...
my favorite.

1:16:06.525 --> 1:16:08.460
Ah!

1:16:08.527 --> 1:16:09.695
No! Clu!

1:16:14.900 --> 1:16:16.268
No, Clu!

1:16:21.773 --> 1:16:23.175
Clu!

1:16:23.242 --> 1:16:25.544
You gotta keep going, Miranda!

1:16:25.611 --> 1:16:28.547
Get to the breaker box!
You gotta keep going!

1:16:30.549 --> 1:16:32.084
You can do this!

1:16:39.892 --> 1:16:41.793
That's right.

1:16:41.860 --> 1:16:43.128
Almost there.

1:16:49.067 --> 1:16:50.536
Yes!

1:16:53.872 --> 1:16:56.308
I can't get to
the breakers from here.

1:16:59.012 --> 1:17:00.947
You have to!

1:17:01.014 --> 1:17:02.414
But I can get to the generator!

1:17:02.481 --> 1:17:03.615
What?

1:17:03.682 --> 1:17:05.985
I'm gonna go this way
to the generator!

1:17:06.051 --> 1:17:07.987
Stay right there!

1:17:08.053 --> 1:17:09.521
Just don't get eaten, all right?

1:18:11.650 --> 1:18:14.586
Just keep moving,
keep moving, keep moving.

1:18:39.478 --> 1:18:41.613
It should be around
here somewhere.

1:18:44.117 --> 1:18:46.151
Oh, God.

1:18:58.064 --> 1:19:02.068
Where is this thing?

1:19:02.135 --> 1:19:03.168
Yes!

1:19:05.570 --> 1:19:06.638
Yes!

1:19:24.690 --> 1:19:26.324
Oh, God!

1:19:26.391 --> 1:19:28.460
Oh, God... oh!

1:19:57.756 --> 1:19:59.691
Ah!

1:20:18.177 --> 1:20:20.512
Come on! We need to get
you all to the truck!

1:20:21.379 --> 1:20:23.248
No, I'm fine.

1:20:23.315 --> 1:20:25.350
Dr. James needs
medical attention.

1:20:27.153 --> 1:20:29.521
Not you, Daniel.

1:20:29.588 --> 1:20:31.556
We're going to your office.

1:20:31.623 --> 1:20:33.492
What?

1:20:33.558 --> 1:20:37.395
The disposal order
from the Eden Zoo supply?

1:20:38.864 --> 1:20:41.167
You told me that we could
get that from your office.

1:20:41.234 --> 1:20:43.970
So let's do that.
I'll follow.

1:20:44.036 --> 1:20:46.038
Miranda?

1:20:46.105 --> 1:20:48.406
We've just been through
hell and back, all right?

1:20:48.473 --> 1:20:50.642
You need to give me a
day to clean up my wounds.

1:20:52.078 --> 1:20:54.279
No.

1:20:54.346 --> 1:20:56.581
Let's make one thing clear.

1:20:56.648 --> 1:20:58.416
You show me that disposal order

1:20:58.483 --> 1:21:01.453
or you tell me
what really happened.

1:21:05.224 --> 1:21:06.558
I'm waiting.

1:21:07.960 --> 1:21:11.063
Fine.
All right.

1:21:11.130 --> 1:21:12.430
It's Blackburn.

1:21:15.001 --> 1:21:16.868
It's all his idea.

1:21:16.936 --> 1:21:18.904
He wants to sell the aquarium
because he can get top dollar.

1:21:18.971 --> 1:21:20.872
And he told me if
I didn't destroy the injectors

1:21:20.940 --> 1:21:22.741
to switch them,
he was gonna cut me in.

1:21:22.808 --> 1:21:25.044
I just thought a few animals
were gonna get hurt.

1:21:25.111 --> 1:21:26.745
I didn't know
this was gonna happen!

1:21:26.812 --> 1:21:28.647
Why did you think
was gonna happen?

1:21:28.713 --> 1:21:31.316
There are innocent people
dead because of you!

1:21:31.383 --> 1:21:33.186
Okay, okay.

1:21:33.252 --> 1:21:34.954
Whoa, whoa, easy, easy now!

1:21:35.021 --> 1:21:36.655
Take him into custody!

1:21:36.721 --> 1:21:38.456
Ma'am, I don't have
that kind of authority.

1:21:38.523 --> 1:21:40.126
I'm only administered
to save lives

1:21:40.193 --> 1:21:42.228
and take the necessary
precautions on site.

1:21:42.295 --> 1:21:45.031
And bring badly injured patients
to the nearest medical hospital.

1:21:45.097 --> 1:21:46.832
Okay.

1:21:48.234 --> 1:21:49.401
- God!
- Ow!

1:21:49.467 --> 1:21:51.037
That'll do it.

1:21:51.103 --> 1:21:52.571
Not cool!

1:21:52.637 --> 1:21:53.973
Come on, buddy.

1:21:59.411 --> 1:22:00.745
Thank you!
