WEBVTT

00:06.500 --> 00:08.083
I know, Antoine. I'm sorry.

00:08.625 --> 00:12.000
I should have told you it was today,
but I'd rather be alone.

00:12.833 --> 00:13.708
Sorry.

00:14.250 --> 00:15.125
I love you.

00:22.791 --> 00:24.375
We'd never leave you all alone.

00:25.375 --> 00:26.500
Never.

00:26.583 --> 00:27.416
Are you okay?

00:30.375 --> 00:31.375
Mrs. Ben Smires?

00:31.458 --> 00:32.583
Yes?

00:32.666 --> 00:35.583
I just need the one
who has an appointment with me.

00:35.666 --> 00:36.708
Right.

00:38.083 --> 00:39.041
Let's go.

00:40.416 --> 00:41.250
Follow me.

00:46.875 --> 00:48.125
He's kind of sketchy.

00:48.208 --> 00:52.083
You are aware that
"voluntary termination of pregnancy"

00:52.166 --> 00:53.208
includes "termination."

00:54.291 --> 00:55.583
Wait, in here.

00:55.666 --> 00:56.500
Here? Okay.

00:57.208 --> 00:58.416
It is irreversible.

00:58.500 --> 00:59.458
It's here. Come.

01:00.041 --> 01:02.583
-There's nothing left, no baby.
-Yes, I know.

01:02.666 --> 01:04.666
It's not really a baby right now.

01:04.750 --> 01:07.208
I mean, it's a cell. I mean…

01:07.291 --> 01:08.166
No, because

01:08.250 --> 01:11.875
in your situation, you could easily
welcome a second child, right?

01:11.958 --> 01:13.416
Why is he interrogating her?

01:13.500 --> 01:15.500
Leave her be. She can handle this asshole.

01:15.583 --> 01:16.666
And your husband?

01:17.291 --> 01:19.375
Does he agree with this termination?

01:19.458 --> 01:20.791
I've told him about it.

01:22.416 --> 01:25.833
-It's her body. She can do what she wants.
-Who exactly are you two?

01:25.916 --> 01:27.000
She's right.

01:27.083 --> 01:29.708
Everything about our bodies
shouldn't be a struggle.

01:29.791 --> 01:31.416
When we want a baby or don't want one.

01:31.500 --> 01:34.083
When we want bigger boobs,
and then we're told that…

01:34.833 --> 01:35.916
Anyway.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.125
No, nothing.

01:37.208 --> 01:39.458
-What?
-This isn't the time to talk about it.

01:39.541 --> 01:40.625
Yes, it is, Chacha.

01:41.208 --> 01:42.416
It is actually the time.

01:42.500 --> 01:44.208
-Ladies, please--
-No, shh.

01:45.291 --> 01:47.416
-But what?
-Go ahead.

01:49.916 --> 01:50.833
I have cancer.

01:51.875 --> 01:52.791
Breast cancer.

01:53.375 --> 01:55.000
Fuck, this isn't happening.

01:55.625 --> 01:58.666
-Stage 1, left breast, 9 mm.
-How long have you known?

01:59.166 --> 02:00.291
I've known since…

02:01.750 --> 02:03.375
We can't leave each other again.

02:03.916 --> 02:05.416
We'll get through this.

02:05.500 --> 02:07.875
Ladies, I'm sorry,
but I have other patients…

02:10.791 --> 02:11.666
You're here?

02:11.750 --> 02:13.458
A NETFLIX SERIES

02:15.000 --> 02:16.375
THE LAME PLAN

02:16.458 --> 02:18.083
THE CRAZY PLAN

02:18.166 --> 02:20.625
THE BOOTY PLAN

02:20.708 --> 02:22.666
THE HOOK-UP PLAN

02:23.416 --> 02:25.375
-You hate me, right?
-No, I don't.

02:27.833 --> 02:29.208
I respect your decision.

02:29.958 --> 02:31.916
We've always been on the same page.

02:32.708 --> 02:34.458
It's not my body. It's yours.

02:36.541 --> 02:38.000
I will always agree with you.

02:50.291 --> 02:53.666
What hurts is that you thought
you could deal with this by yourself,

02:53.750 --> 02:54.875
without me.

02:54.958 --> 02:56.666
I didn't want you to feel guilty.

02:57.166 --> 02:58.666
We shouldn't feel guilty.

03:00.166 --> 03:01.000
Right?

03:07.500 --> 03:09.250
Are you ready? Can we go?

03:09.333 --> 03:10.833
-Okay, boomer.
-We're coming.

03:16.958 --> 03:18.125
Are you sure you're okay?

03:18.208 --> 03:20.000
Yeah, we said no freaking out.

03:20.083 --> 03:23.166
The upside to having cancer
is that you can't call me selfish.

03:23.250 --> 03:26.083
-And I'll be able to ask you for anything.
-You idiot.

03:26.166 --> 03:27.708
Okay, promise.

03:28.250 --> 03:30.541
No freaking out.

03:31.208 --> 03:32.041
Oh crap.

03:33.208 --> 03:35.250
People are actually
going to see this thing?

03:35.333 --> 03:37.333
Yeah, now you have a reason to freak out.

03:37.833 --> 03:38.666
But…

03:39.166 --> 03:42.083
It's Malika, one of the Pinkars drivers.
She probably misses me.

03:42.166 --> 03:44.291
What is up with that body? That's not him!

03:45.958 --> 03:47.625
CHAVRINOU
BAAACK TO NATURE

03:47.708 --> 03:48.916
Hey! No!

03:49.416 --> 03:50.791
What the hell did they do?

03:51.416 --> 03:53.708
Pinkars, lady drivers,
we cater to our clients!

03:53.791 --> 03:54.875
What is this?

03:54.958 --> 03:56.166
A whore on wheels?

03:58.625 --> 03:59.458
You know what?

04:00.583 --> 04:01.916
We don't give a damn.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.208
-We don't?
-Yeah.

04:03.291 --> 04:06.083
But I didn't create Pinkars
to get big macho guys off.

04:06.166 --> 04:08.000
I'm more worried about other things.

04:08.083 --> 04:11.458
Max and his small-dick douche friends
really screwed me over.

04:11.541 --> 04:14.250
We should castrate them
and make cocktail wieners.

04:15.041 --> 04:16.958
Well, not for me. I'm vegetarian.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.333
-Did you become funny?
-You weren't around. I had to compensate.

04:21.416 --> 04:23.958
MAXIME PAUILLAC
THE TIME FOR NINE

04:29.375 --> 04:33.791
Well, that's it, party's over.
In three months, we'll have a Green mayor.

04:33.875 --> 04:34.750
-Bye.
-Bye.

04:38.916 --> 04:40.875
Charlotte, I wanted to tell you…

04:42.416 --> 04:43.791
I heard about your…

04:43.875 --> 04:45.875
It was a pleasure working with you too.

04:45.958 --> 04:48.416
Truly. Even though
you're kind of annoying,

04:48.500 --> 04:51.375
you listen to Mylène Farmer too much,
but you're efficient.

04:53.458 --> 04:55.750
And Chantal? I've always wanted to know.

04:55.833 --> 04:58.541
Did you really believe
in this campaign? In him?

04:58.625 --> 05:00.125
No, not this campaign.

05:00.208 --> 05:01.666
Or him, by the way.

05:01.750 --> 05:04.250
Though I'm praying this bad buzz
will help him change.

05:04.333 --> 05:06.875
For the money? I wouldn't have thought.

05:06.958 --> 05:08.458
You're the one I believed in.

05:09.083 --> 05:10.208
Excuse me?

05:10.291 --> 05:12.000
So you have a crush on me?

05:12.083 --> 05:15.250
Shit, why didn't I think of it before?
It makes sense.

05:15.333 --> 05:19.000
It's funny how you straight people
always have that reaction.

05:19.083 --> 05:21.583
A gay person likes you,
and you switch into erotic mode.

05:21.666 --> 05:23.708
I'm not in that mode at all right now.

05:23.791 --> 05:26.041
-Why not…
-Charlotte. Come back.

05:26.875 --> 05:29.041
You were ruining your life with Pauillac.

05:29.125 --> 05:31.875
You were the driving force
behind this campaign.

05:31.958 --> 05:35.791
Generating energy from gyms,
putting flowers at bus stops for the bees,

05:35.875 --> 05:39.000
creating workspaces with childcare,
organizing support groups.

05:39.083 --> 05:42.208
He thought those ideas sucked,
but they were brilliant.

05:42.708 --> 05:44.625
Yeah, okay. I do get ideas that are…

05:45.791 --> 05:47.250
You stayed for my butt too?

05:48.041 --> 05:50.875
-I've done a lot of squats.
-You're a pain.

05:50.958 --> 05:52.458
No, hey, I'm kidding!

05:52.541 --> 05:54.291
You really stayed for me?

05:54.375 --> 05:55.958
Thank you, naughty girl!

05:56.041 --> 05:58.250
Fucking shit.

06:25.708 --> 06:29.291
A winter garden.
Of course. What a wonderful idea.

06:29.375 --> 06:32.166
Don't get excited.
The company hasn't gotten back to me.

06:32.250 --> 06:33.375
-Really?
-Yeah.

06:33.458 --> 06:35.666
And I'm not the one
who's going to build this.

06:35.750 --> 06:38.666
Nor my workers
because they're fake, so… Yeah.

06:39.791 --> 06:42.083
And I'm actually having
a hard time by myself.

06:42.166 --> 06:43.416
It's true, I am.

06:43.500 --> 06:45.750
Because I'm just a human.
I'm not a mermaid.

06:45.833 --> 06:49.250
And after everything lately, I want
to give my time to the people I love.

06:49.333 --> 06:50.875
To them and to Eddy.

06:50.958 --> 06:53.500
I want to get home at four and enjoy him.

06:53.583 --> 06:55.250
So, yes, we'll do something awesome,

06:55.333 --> 06:57.583
but it's going to take a year

06:57.666 --> 07:00.666
because I don't have
the awesome network I told you about,

07:00.750 --> 07:02.625
and no woman can excel at everything,

07:02.708 --> 07:04.666
despite what we've been led to believe!

07:04.750 --> 07:07.500
But who is forcing you to excel?

07:08.458 --> 07:11.041
The important thing
is to bloom in the morning

07:11.125 --> 07:14.583
and receive the evening
like a gift from the heavens.

07:15.250 --> 07:18.500
Right? That's what matters,
and I say yes to everything.

07:18.583 --> 07:21.166
A year, perfect.
We'll spend a year together.

07:21.250 --> 07:22.416
-Really?
-Yes.

07:22.500 --> 07:23.583
Let's celebrate.

07:24.250 --> 07:26.083
All right, yeah. Okay.

07:26.666 --> 07:28.125
My little chestnut.

07:28.708 --> 07:31.750
Put away the breakfast dishes. Done.
Get Eddy dressed. Done.

07:31.833 --> 07:35.208
Replace the bathroom seals. Done.
Plant bulbs, that's in progress.

07:35.958 --> 07:37.041
Make Eddy's snack…

07:37.125 --> 07:40.208
Shit, I'll never have time.
When is she coming home? Four?

07:40.833 --> 07:42.916
-Don't you know how to plant bulbs?
-I do.

07:44.666 --> 07:46.583
-What?
-It's upside down.

07:47.333 --> 07:48.166
That's right.

07:52.416 --> 07:55.291
You did a good thing
telling Charlotte about Emilie.

07:58.958 --> 08:01.875
I realize that sometimes
I can be kind of selfish, and…

08:03.458 --> 08:04.708
I wanted to apologize.

08:04.791 --> 08:08.291
About Charlotte, I'm sorry.
I wasn't thinking about you.

08:13.791 --> 08:17.541
If you want it to grow well, plant it
as deep as twice the size of the bulb.

08:24.291 --> 08:25.750
We're kind of dick brothers now.

08:26.291 --> 08:27.750
-Dick brothers?
-Hi!

08:27.833 --> 08:28.708
Shit.

08:29.958 --> 08:32.208
Hey, relax, boys.

08:32.291 --> 08:35.166
No one can blame her
for anything now. She has cancer.

08:35.250 --> 08:37.958
She's spending a few days here,
so get over yourselves.

08:41.583 --> 08:42.750
Let's get you settled in.

08:45.708 --> 08:48.083
Elsa's still not picking up.
It's driving me nuts.

08:48.166 --> 08:49.791
Anita, how are you, beautiful?

08:50.625 --> 08:51.708
My mother again?

08:52.291 --> 08:53.583
Julio's not doing great.

08:53.666 --> 08:56.583
We're waiting to hear
if Elsa produced some eggs.

08:56.666 --> 08:59.208
We're all anxious. We want this child, so…

09:00.625 --> 09:02.958
She's asking
if you remember your father's song.

09:03.500 --> 09:05.208
She sang it whenever you were sad.

09:06.541 --> 09:07.416
Which one?

09:12.541 --> 09:13.833
That was a great song.

09:32.041 --> 09:34.125
Did you think
that would get me talking to you?

09:34.625 --> 09:36.416
Are we in a coffee commercial?

09:37.125 --> 09:38.500
Yeah, well, I tried.

09:40.791 --> 09:42.041
This place is nice.

09:42.125 --> 09:43.500
You did a good job.

09:46.916 --> 09:48.666
You don't have to forgive me.

09:49.333 --> 09:50.833
But I have a lump, you know.

09:51.333 --> 09:52.458
Cancer.

10:05.583 --> 10:08.625
Your cancer is probably thinking,
"I have a Charlotte,"

10:08.708 --> 10:10.125
and it's pissing it off.

10:13.416 --> 10:17.250
I almost laughed until I realized
you're comparing me to a deadly disease.

10:18.583 --> 10:20.083
It's a matter of perspective.

10:22.458 --> 10:24.833
For me,
having a Charlotte is the opposite.

10:26.833 --> 10:29.416
The symptoms are life.

10:29.500 --> 10:31.250
They're love.

10:31.333 --> 10:33.916
They're strength.

10:36.708 --> 10:38.000
You're a sun, Charlotte.

10:40.375 --> 10:41.791
That cancer of yours…

10:43.416 --> 10:44.791
doesn't stand a chance.

10:50.958 --> 10:51.791
Thanks.

10:54.291 --> 10:55.833
You're the coffee commercial.

10:56.833 --> 10:58.166
And that thing is ugly.

11:01.208 --> 11:02.791
Saying thank you was enough.

11:17.291 --> 11:18.333
It'll be all right.

11:19.041 --> 11:19.875
Right?

11:23.916 --> 11:26.916
Nothing. I'm sorry,
we were unable to harvest a single egg.

11:27.416 --> 11:31.000
This stimulation is a failure.
A complete disaster.

11:31.833 --> 11:33.833
And I gave you some serious doses.

11:34.583 --> 11:37.125
Yes, I felt it.

11:38.250 --> 11:39.958
So what's the next step?

11:41.666 --> 11:43.583
I wish I didn't have to tell you this

11:43.666 --> 11:46.083
because I know
it's never pleasant to hear,

11:46.666 --> 11:48.583
but given the results,

11:49.625 --> 11:51.958
it would be a miracle
if you ever have a child.

11:53.583 --> 11:54.833
So I'm…

11:56.250 --> 11:58.083
I'm infertile, aren't I?

11:58.166 --> 11:59.000
Yes.

12:01.458 --> 12:03.541
<i>That's why I wanted to see you alone.</i>

12:03.625 --> 12:07.333
<i>I'll let you discuss it with your partner,</i>
<i>but there are other options.</i>

12:08.458 --> 12:10.791
<i>It would be a miracle</i>
<i>if you ever have a child.</i>

12:10.875 --> 12:13.875
<i>Egg donation is very hard,</i>
<i>both physically and mentally.</i>

12:13.958 --> 12:16.625
<i>It's legal in Spain… There's adoption…</i>

12:30.791 --> 12:35.708
GIRLS AND BOYS

12:37.458 --> 12:39.416
Good, you're starting again
from the basics.

12:40.916 --> 12:42.250
Are we still kidding around?

12:44.250 --> 12:47.416
You keeping your cancer from me
made me realize some things.

12:48.291 --> 12:50.750
Sorry, I'm in a huge rush,
and I'm pissed at you,

12:50.833 --> 12:52.958
so can we do
the mea culpa scene in a week?

12:54.583 --> 12:56.375
I'm truly sorry, Charlotte.

12:58.875 --> 13:02.041
Did you know what your friends
were planning to do with Pinkars?

13:05.291 --> 13:06.125
Yes.

13:07.708 --> 13:08.916
Okay, bye.

13:13.041 --> 13:15.708
To change, you have to stop being a moron.

13:15.791 --> 13:17.791
Your lump is your alpha male ego,

13:17.875 --> 13:20.500
and you better believe
I would love to smash it.

13:21.083 --> 13:22.958
Would you agree to help me smash it?

13:23.041 --> 13:24.000
Smash what?

13:25.208 --> 13:26.791
My stupid shitty alpha male ego.

13:26.875 --> 13:29.125
Wow, that's a big project.

13:29.208 --> 13:30.666
Yeah, there's a lot of work.

13:32.041 --> 13:33.208
Let's start now.

13:33.291 --> 13:36.333
-I'll cancel my facial cleanse.
-No, reschedule it.

13:36.916 --> 13:38.458
KILLING THE ALPHA MALE - SESSION 1

13:38.541 --> 13:40.041
-Are you focused? Ready?
-Yes.

13:40.750 --> 13:42.583
"Women have always been…

13:44.083 --> 13:44.916
men's."

13:46.333 --> 13:47.416
Best friend.

13:47.500 --> 13:48.916
Raise your hand.

13:49.666 --> 13:51.250
-Did I get it right?
-What?

13:51.333 --> 13:53.458
I said, "Women
have always been man's best friend."

13:54.916 --> 13:56.000
No!

13:56.083 --> 13:57.166
That's dogs!

13:57.250 --> 13:58.166
Right.

13:58.250 --> 13:59.958
-"Right" what?
-Right, that's dogs.

14:00.666 --> 14:02.333
-Okay.
-Let's move on.

14:02.416 --> 14:04.041
-Shit.
-We're off to a bad start.

14:05.083 --> 14:06.375
"A woman

14:06.458 --> 14:07.625
can have

14:07.708 --> 14:10.833
either clitoral or vaginal orgasms."
True or false?

14:11.791 --> 14:14.500
True. That's easy.
It's my area of expertise.

14:15.666 --> 14:18.291
No, false! Orgasms are strictly clitoral.

14:18.375 --> 14:21.583
You can also stimulate
the clitoris from inside the vagina,

14:21.666 --> 14:23.500
but there is no vaginal orgasm.

14:23.583 --> 14:24.750
It's only clitoral.

14:24.833 --> 14:28.791
That's for you two, but I've made
tons of women have vaginal orgasms.

14:28.875 --> 14:30.791
-They were faking it.
-No way.

14:31.291 --> 14:32.125
Yes way.

14:33.583 --> 14:34.583
But why?

14:39.000 --> 14:40.791
Did you fake it with me?

14:47.500 --> 14:48.333
Well?

14:50.375 --> 14:51.291
Well, nothing.

14:55.208 --> 14:56.375
And there never will be.

14:57.875 --> 14:59.041
My belly sucks.

15:01.041 --> 15:02.833
You can leave me if you want.

15:04.250 --> 15:05.125
I would understand.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.333
How can you say that?

15:12.916 --> 15:14.833
Hang on. Clown fish never give up.

15:15.333 --> 15:16.291
You told me that.

15:16.875 --> 15:17.833
Neither do we.

15:21.250 --> 15:23.625
We've always done
things differently, right?

15:24.125 --> 15:25.041
Differently.

15:25.916 --> 15:27.791
We'll turn this obstacle into strength.

15:27.875 --> 15:30.875
We have always reinvented ourselves,
so we'll keep doing that.

15:30.958 --> 15:32.083
Nothing will change.

15:37.625 --> 15:39.416
I love you even more, Mrs. Clown.

15:42.625 --> 15:44.666
I love you even more, Mr. Clown.

15:49.125 --> 15:50.333
Okay, next.

15:50.416 --> 15:52.708
KILLING THE ALPHA MALE - SESSION 2

15:52.791 --> 15:54.875
All right. Let's go. Okay.

15:54.958 --> 15:56.958
"Does every woman dream
of having children"?

15:57.041 --> 15:57.916
TRUE - FALSE

15:58.708 --> 16:01.458
-Is this a trick question?
-Don't rush.

16:02.166 --> 16:04.250
Does every woman dream of having children?

16:05.541 --> 16:07.125
-No!
-Wait.

16:07.208 --> 16:10.333
Are you crazy? Does every woman
dream of having children? Yes.

16:11.083 --> 16:14.333
There's a problem with the wording.
Does every woman dream? Yes.

16:14.416 --> 16:15.916
What do women dream about?

16:16.000 --> 16:18.958
Fuck, I mean… What about me?
Do I dream of having children?

16:19.041 --> 16:21.416
-No, but not you.
-Well, then!

16:21.500 --> 16:23.916
-But all the women I know--
-No!

16:24.416 --> 16:25.958
Okay. So then…

16:26.041 --> 16:27.541
-So…
-So?

16:27.625 --> 16:29.750
Does every woman dream of having children?

16:32.458 --> 16:33.291
False.

16:33.375 --> 16:34.500
-There.
-Awesome.

16:34.583 --> 16:36.000
-That's good.
-It's news to me.

16:36.083 --> 16:37.875
Okay, professional situation.

16:37.958 --> 16:39.708
-Stay focused.
-Yes.

16:39.791 --> 16:41.416
So, you're Corinne.

16:41.500 --> 16:42.458
The cute accountant.

16:42.541 --> 16:44.458
-Nice big boobs.
-That speaks to me.

16:44.541 --> 16:45.625
Pretty little face.

16:45.708 --> 16:48.708
It's Friday night,
and you're working on your last file.

16:48.791 --> 16:50.083
Okay, I'm your boss.

16:50.666 --> 16:52.083
Good evening, Corinne.

16:52.166 --> 16:56.250
Say now, don't forget
to personally put that file in my hands.

16:59.625 --> 17:02.083
-Of course.
-You're so gross!

17:02.166 --> 17:03.458
But why?

17:03.541 --> 17:06.583
-This guy keeps falling for every trap.
-I don't understand.

17:06.666 --> 17:12.166
Wait. No, it depends because if
the woman wants to have a relationship--

17:12.250 --> 17:13.208
No!

17:13.291 --> 17:16.541
She wants to finish up her file!
She's exhausted! She wants to go home!

17:16.625 --> 17:19.541
Wait, I think you're
man-terrupting me right now.

17:21.791 --> 17:22.625
Yeah.

17:22.708 --> 17:23.833
-Yeah.
-Maybe.

17:23.916 --> 17:25.375
-I think so.
-Yeah.

17:25.458 --> 17:26.625
So,

17:26.708 --> 17:29.166
if I may say something
because additionally,

17:29.250 --> 17:31.500
this is something positive
regarding myself,

17:31.583 --> 17:34.375
it's just that I don't mind at all

17:34.458 --> 17:35.666
working under women.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.375
Good. We have made some progress.

17:40.458 --> 17:41.416
It even turns me on.

17:41.500 --> 17:43.083
-Stop it!
-Fuck, no!

17:43.166 --> 17:44.208
I believed him.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.125
What?

17:46.208 --> 17:47.375
Don't cut my balls off.

17:47.958 --> 17:49.166
Manspreading.

17:49.666 --> 17:52.625
-Mr. Gollard smells bad, doesn't he?
-Gollard? No.

17:53.708 --> 17:55.041
That old man moved me.

17:57.458 --> 17:58.625
Nicole,

17:58.708 --> 18:01.375
I don't think I'm going
to take the job in Paris.

18:02.666 --> 18:03.916
What's gotten into you?

18:05.208 --> 18:08.875
-You like wiping old people's asses now?
-Not particularly.

18:11.166 --> 18:12.000
But,

18:13.166 --> 18:14.583
I like working with you.

18:15.125 --> 18:16.500
Doing something useful.

18:17.208 --> 18:20.833
Actually, I think
I needed a big dose of reminder.

18:24.333 --> 18:26.333
-Let's not get soft here.
-Let's go.

18:26.916 --> 18:29.416
-Great. Let's keep going. Ready?
-Okay.

18:29.500 --> 18:30.791
I can't feel my feet.

18:33.208 --> 18:34.500
"Does 'no' mean 'yes'"?

18:36.125 --> 18:36.958
Whoa.

18:37.958 --> 18:39.083
That's a tough one.

18:41.791 --> 18:44.500
Sometimes they say "no, no," but actually…

18:45.916 --> 18:46.875
False.

18:48.958 --> 18:49.916
-Not bad.
-Yeah!

18:50.000 --> 18:52.083
-False.
-That's right!

18:52.916 --> 18:53.958
Okay, cool.

18:54.875 --> 18:58.500
However, I have a question.
If the woman says, "Oh, no."

18:59.083 --> 18:59.958
"No…"

19:00.750 --> 19:01.750
"Oh no…"

19:01.833 --> 19:06.000
-Fuck, he's asking for it.
-Didn't you see Angèle's music video?

19:06.083 --> 19:09.083
-So "no" means--
-It means "no."

19:09.166 --> 19:10.958
-There you go!
-Good job.

19:12.083 --> 19:12.916
Why?

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
Years of male domination.
You're always going to owe us.

19:16.083 --> 19:17.041
Totally.

19:17.541 --> 19:18.666
A little more.

19:18.750 --> 19:20.708
Wait, not the breasts!

19:37.541 --> 19:39.750
Her hairstyles were all shitty anyway.

19:43.041 --> 19:45.541
And her monochrome style looked like crap.

19:46.625 --> 19:47.958
And all pleather too.

20:01.291 --> 20:04.083
BOOKSTORE

20:04.166 --> 20:05.083
-Hello.
-Hello.

20:05.166 --> 20:07.541
FEMINIST DEMOCRACY REINVENTING POWER

20:13.125 --> 20:15.958
-Let him live a little.
-Eddy, a little slower.

20:16.041 --> 20:19.291
Just let him have fun.
There's no one around, no cars.

20:19.375 --> 20:22.708
-There are no cars for now.
-The kid needs to have some experiences.

20:22.791 --> 20:25.125
-Even if he falls.
-He can't see with his hood on.

20:25.625 --> 20:27.958
-Wait a second.
-Leave him alone.

20:28.041 --> 20:29.291
It's super dangerous.

20:30.791 --> 20:31.625
There.

20:31.708 --> 20:34.125
ENCHANTRESS MOON - SHRINKING MOON

OVULATION CALENDAR

20:58.916 --> 21:00.125
Sorry, Gayusha.

21:24.791 --> 21:25.625
Eddy!

21:26.250 --> 21:27.166
Come see Mommy.

21:33.625 --> 21:36.000
You're so big. Do you have your things?

21:36.083 --> 21:37.291
-Hi.
-Yes?

21:37.375 --> 21:38.250
Oh, you came.

21:40.333 --> 21:42.416
Get your things. Can I take them?

21:42.916 --> 21:44.041
Okay, I'm taking them.

21:45.666 --> 21:46.875
No, this one.

21:50.083 --> 21:53.333
SUZANNE
COME, BRING CHANTAL!

21:54.333 --> 21:56.916
-This is the broccoli emergency?
-We have work to do.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.041
Actually, you do, because I can't cook.

21:59.125 --> 22:01.625
All right. But what's going on?

22:01.708 --> 22:04.416
I gave a lot of thought
to what you yelled in my face.

22:04.500 --> 22:07.250
Because of you,
this will never be a nightclub.

22:07.333 --> 22:09.625
And also you,
but I'm not in love with you.

22:10.125 --> 22:12.375
Yeah, okay. That's irrelevant.

22:12.458 --> 22:14.500
So, what is it going to be?

22:14.583 --> 22:17.666
It's going to become
a care home run by women for women.

22:18.500 --> 22:19.583
And a community canteen.

22:21.125 --> 22:22.750
Isn't that what you wanted?

22:22.833 --> 22:24.541
Well, actually, Suzanne…

22:24.625 --> 22:27.083
Yes, but since we don't work here anymore…

22:27.708 --> 22:29.583
Of course you work here, airheads.

22:29.666 --> 22:31.500
So, hang on, Suzanne, that means

22:31.583 --> 22:35.708
you're reoffering me my dream job
because you're un-quitting me.

22:35.791 --> 22:37.083
Yes. That's right.

22:37.166 --> 22:39.791
Though I don't get your idea of "dream."
This isn't Hollywood.

22:40.416 --> 22:43.750
You can get your hands dirty,
and you enjoy that, so it's perfect.

22:43.833 --> 22:47.500
The canteen will open for Christmas
and the care home after renovations. Okay?

22:48.000 --> 22:49.291
I'll leave you to it.

22:49.375 --> 22:51.041
I'm going to go plant Dad.

22:51.791 --> 22:53.000
"Plant Dad"?

22:53.083 --> 22:54.750
-You explain it to her.
-Right.

22:54.833 --> 22:57.000
And I'm not doing it
because I'm in love with you.

22:59.500 --> 23:01.250
She's crazy about you.

23:01.333 --> 23:02.166
Yes.

23:02.666 --> 23:03.875
It's funny, though.

23:03.958 --> 23:05.625
Chantalou, come on.

23:06.666 --> 23:07.666
Oh, you're here!

23:09.458 --> 23:10.416
No, I'm kidding.

23:10.500 --> 23:13.500
Well, hello to all you momtrepreneurs

23:13.583 --> 23:16.958
and mompreneurs,
and also women who don't work,

23:17.041 --> 23:18.750
and non-moms who work.

23:18.833 --> 23:20.458
Well, all women, really.

23:20.541 --> 23:22.375
And those who just became women.

23:22.458 --> 23:24.541
And the men too. It's a freebie.

23:24.625 --> 23:26.166
Anyway, I'm back

23:26.833 --> 23:30.875
to wish all you men, women, non-binary,

23:30.958 --> 23:33.291
anyway, hashtag "inclusive language,"

23:33.375 --> 23:35.541
to try to get rid

23:35.625 --> 23:36.666
of this.

23:36.750 --> 23:37.750
There.

23:38.416 --> 23:39.625
Oh no. Sorry. Silly.

23:40.125 --> 23:41.458
This.

23:41.541 --> 23:43.125
Right, this is what's important.

23:43.208 --> 23:44.541
MENTAL LOAD
SOCIAL PRESSURE

23:44.625 --> 23:47.666
Basically everything that ruins our lives.
There. This, gone.

23:47.750 --> 23:48.916
GUILT

23:49.000 --> 23:52.958
Because we all agree.
We carry an awful lot of this around.

23:53.041 --> 23:54.000
So, there, gone.

23:54.541 --> 23:55.416
There.

23:55.500 --> 23:56.458
That feels good.

23:56.541 --> 24:00.166
Now, I know this will be
very hard for you, my little followers,

24:00.250 --> 24:03.291
but starting today,
I will be less present on social media.

24:03.375 --> 24:05.333
I'm done putting pressure on myself.

24:05.416 --> 24:06.250
There.

24:06.750 --> 24:09.375
Sometimes, I suck too.
I mean, often, actually.

24:09.875 --> 24:14.083
And soon, I'll tell you the story
of the year that most upended my life

24:14.166 --> 24:16.500
because I think
it will help more than one of you.

24:16.583 --> 24:18.583
There. Not to get more followers,

24:19.083 --> 24:21.500
but because I think
it's important for things to be said.

24:22.083 --> 24:24.541

24:24.625 --> 24:26.250
COMMANDO OUTFIT REQUIRED
NEED YOU GIRLS

24:26.333 --> 24:29.583
Okay, speaking of priorities,
I need to leave you.

24:29.666 --> 24:32.041
So hugs to all,
and I hope to see you soon.

24:33.416 --> 24:36.333
-But what is… This place is scary.
-Yeah.

24:38.333 --> 24:40.958
-Awesome.
-What the hell are we doing here?

24:41.041 --> 24:43.333
We're here to get our revenge.

24:43.416 --> 24:46.000
-Well, my revenge.
-So selfish, but lump.

24:48.125 --> 24:49.791
Hey, she's funny now.

24:49.875 --> 24:52.291
Don't let her get too confident.
It'll get on my nerves.

24:52.375 --> 24:53.250
Right.

24:53.750 --> 24:55.500
Where are your commando outfits?

24:56.291 --> 24:57.125
Commando!

24:59.416 --> 25:00.916
-Seriously?
-What?

25:01.000 --> 25:02.291
-Where's mine?
-Here.

25:02.375 --> 25:04.000
I have the same as yours?

25:04.083 --> 25:05.291
-Yes, why?
-Oh, no…

25:05.375 --> 25:07.500
I asked for a commando outfit,
and I got a plumber.

25:07.583 --> 25:09.000
This is all I had, okay?

25:09.083 --> 25:10.916
I wanted the hard stuff, like this.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
-I'm the boss!
-Okay.

25:12.083 --> 25:13.291
-Okay, ready?
-Yes.

25:13.375 --> 25:16.750
We are in the parking lot
where the Pinkars vehicles are parked.

25:16.833 --> 25:19.291
The new owners totally ruined the concept.

25:19.375 --> 25:20.916
-They did?
-Can I get a word in?

25:21.000 --> 25:22.083
Yes, sorry.

25:22.166 --> 25:24.583
So the new owners
totally ruined the concept.

25:24.666 --> 25:25.666
Yes, the concept.

25:26.666 --> 25:28.833
We're here to let them know
this is not okay.

25:28.916 --> 25:30.291
Not okay!

25:30.916 --> 25:33.875
And that Pinkars should
serve women, not exploit them.

25:33.958 --> 25:35.000
Definitely not.

25:35.791 --> 25:37.916
-Shh. No, seriously. Shh.
-All right.

25:38.000 --> 25:38.833
-Okay.
-Okay.

25:38.916 --> 25:40.125
-So?
-So…

25:40.208 --> 25:42.250
-Rush hour is in one hour.
-Rush!

25:42.333 --> 25:43.583
That hurt.

25:43.666 --> 25:44.666
Sorry, I'm sorry.

25:45.250 --> 25:46.375
Sorry.

25:46.458 --> 25:47.416
Sorry.

25:47.500 --> 25:49.875
In an hour,
the guard will do a 15-minute round

25:49.958 --> 25:52.375
in the other building,
leaving the lot unguarded.

25:52.458 --> 25:55.291
Unguarded. So let's be
quick, efficient, and sneaky!

25:56.708 --> 25:58.291
-There.
-And go.

25:58.375 --> 25:59.416
-No.
-What?

25:59.500 --> 26:00.416
It's too early.

26:00.916 --> 26:02.666
Hang on. This is illegal.

26:04.125 --> 26:05.125
What?

26:05.958 --> 26:06.791
What?

26:06.875 --> 26:08.250
We could get arrested.

26:08.333 --> 26:10.500
-Man, you suck.
-We could go to jail.

26:10.583 --> 26:12.416
I don't want to go to jail.

26:12.500 --> 26:14.916
Are you sure there wasn't
a bit of me in your shots?

26:15.000 --> 26:15.916
Oh, you're a pain.

26:20.583 --> 26:21.750
-Okay, go.
-Okay.

26:22.250 --> 26:23.083
Come on.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.375
Synchronizing watches.

26:26.458 --> 26:28.166
-I was about to say that.
-Sorry.

26:28.250 --> 26:29.750
7:00 p.m. We have 15 minutes.

26:29.833 --> 26:31.208
-Let's go.
-What are we doing?

26:31.291 --> 26:34.000
-We're tagging the cars.
-Right. These ones?

26:34.083 --> 26:35.833
No, the Pinkars, over there.

26:35.916 --> 26:37.458
The Pinkars, got it.

26:37.541 --> 26:39.583
-Come on.
-We're going to get caught.

27:02.333 --> 27:03.750
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

27:17.250 --> 27:19.083
Oh, what's going on?

27:19.958 --> 27:22.583
Shit, it's those new
chauffeured cars with escorts.

27:22.666 --> 27:25.958
You think he saw what's on the car?
He looks really stupid.

27:28.208 --> 27:29.166
Here.

27:29.750 --> 27:31.083
Is there too much salt?

27:34.375 --> 27:35.875
-No, it's really good.
-Yes.

27:35.958 --> 27:37.125
-Yeah.
-Cool.

27:38.041 --> 27:41.208
Do you know if the girls
will be home in time for dinner?

27:41.291 --> 27:43.833
I'm making a new recipe
from the Food Network, so…

27:43.916 --> 27:45.625
This guy has really changed.

27:45.708 --> 27:46.958
The training worked.

27:47.041 --> 27:48.125
Thanks.

27:48.208 --> 27:50.875
But rethink the outfit.
You look like a '50s housewife.

27:53.666 --> 27:55.083
Anyway, it's simmering.

27:59.958 --> 28:01.416
-How are you doing?
-Okay.

28:02.333 --> 28:04.541
I've been thinking about you and Elsa.

28:04.625 --> 28:06.916
I think you both need
to stop worrying so much.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
Maybe it's not the right time for a kid.

28:12.500 --> 28:14.500
Or it's because of your previous job.

28:15.083 --> 28:16.458
It ate into your reserves of…

28:17.208 --> 28:18.916
Did you ejaculate every time?

28:19.000 --> 28:20.625
-Fuck.
-What?

28:22.041 --> 28:24.083
He could use training in psychology too.

28:24.166 --> 28:26.875
-Excuse me for trying to cheer you up.
-Look, it's working.

28:28.000 --> 28:31.375
You know what?
Let's drink to this lovely, shitty period.

28:31.458 --> 28:32.333
-Let's go.
-There.

28:32.416 --> 28:37.916
So, to the alpha male who has fallen
but who's trying to improve.

28:39.250 --> 28:42.333
To the guy who's too fertile
but managed to make a choice.

28:43.000 --> 28:44.958
To the broken

28:45.041 --> 28:46.166
but creative heart.

28:46.958 --> 28:48.041
And then, well,

28:48.125 --> 28:49.541
to infertility.

28:50.041 --> 28:51.000
But full of love.

28:51.083 --> 28:52.666
There. To life, guys.

28:52.750 --> 28:53.583
Cheers.

28:53.666 --> 28:55.666
-Come on, cheers.
-Cheers, guys.

28:55.750 --> 28:56.583
To us.

28:57.083 --> 28:58.666
Wait. It's the girls.

29:00.125 --> 29:01.875
-"We're on our way."
-Right.

29:01.958 --> 29:03.041
They already ate.

29:03.125 --> 29:04.083
Seriously?

29:06.416 --> 29:08.333
Oh well. More sausages for us.

29:15.625 --> 29:18.416
-Even though they rarely turn those down.
-Fuck, no.

29:18.500 --> 29:20.833
Sorry. Sorry, fuck.

29:20.916 --> 29:21.875
Sorry.

29:22.791 --> 29:24.708
ALPHA MALE
BETA

29:24.791 --> 29:26.833
Our plan worked great.

29:26.916 --> 29:27.875
My plan.

29:29.625 --> 29:31.541
It felt good to take my mind off things.

29:48.083 --> 29:49.750
I can never have children.

29:51.291 --> 29:52.541
-What?
-What?

29:56.958 --> 30:00.583
Is it me, or has life been
throwing shit at all of us lately?

30:02.833 --> 30:04.958
Well, to this shitty year.

30:05.583 --> 30:09.208
But to this brief moment of happiness,
like a shooting star.

30:09.291 --> 30:11.958
We've switched. You're the poet,
and you've become funny.

30:13.375 --> 30:15.000
-Yeah, okay. Settle down.
-Right.

30:17.291 --> 30:18.333
Hey, girls.

30:18.416 --> 30:21.375
Shit, I just had a genius idea.

30:21.458 --> 30:23.333
-No, thanks.
-No, thanks.

30:23.416 --> 30:25.291
I swear, this time it's good.

30:25.375 --> 30:28.500
Because of chemo,
they're insisting on freezing my eggs.

30:28.583 --> 30:30.125
Either they go to waste, or…

30:31.833 --> 30:33.583
they're useful to someone.
